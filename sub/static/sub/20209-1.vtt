01:47.933 --> 01:49.433
You must be Katie.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.633
Hi, I'm Rachel.

01:52.933 --> 01:55.600
So what grade are you in?

01:55.967 --> 01:56.867
Fifth.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.267
Fifth, do you like school?

01:59.767 --> 02:01.266
It's okay.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.566
It's okay, what do you
wanna be when you grow up?

02:03.567 --> 02:05.366
I think I wanna be a doctor

02:05.367 --> 02:06.866
or maybe a singer.

02:06.867 --> 02:11.667
Oh, well there is no rush to decide.

02:12.467 --> 02:13.332
Thank you.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.500
Okay.

02:22.533 --> 02:23.533
Okay.

02:25.733 --> 02:26.933
Let's...

02:28.267 --> 02:30.866
Let's take a look inside, shall we?

02:30.867 --> 02:32.000
There you go.

02:32.967 --> 02:33.900
Open.

02:35.267 --> 02:36.567
A little wider please.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.632
Okay.

02:37.633 --> 02:38.466
Ow!

02:38.467 --> 02:40.800
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.766
Hey, let's see if we can do

02:42.767 --> 02:44.067
something about the pain, all right?

02:45.433 --> 02:48.532
You know, when I was your age

02:48.533 --> 02:50.567
I hated going to the dentist.

02:51.967 --> 02:54.532
But when I was your age we did not have

02:54.533 --> 02:58.033
these cool medications
to take the pain away.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.100
There we go.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.567
All right, that should do it.

03:05.467 --> 03:06.667
Okay.

03:21.433 --> 03:22.932
We're gonna need to run more tests.

03:22.933 --> 03:24.399
Your blood pressure is elevated

03:24.400 --> 03:27.100
and your heart rate
is higher than normal.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.933
And how have you been feeling lately?

03:32.500 --> 03:33.667
Fine.

03:34.267 --> 03:36.166
I've been a little fatigued, but my

03:36.167 --> 03:38.033
schedule's been pretty hectic lately.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.700
Have you had any cold
or flu symptoms at all?

03:46.400 --> 03:48.166
I had a stomach bug a few weeks ago,

03:48.167 --> 03:49.833
but it went away.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.300
Okay.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.266
I'd like you to sit back on the table

03:54.267 --> 03:55.932
and see if you could get your legs

03:55.933 --> 03:57.267
all the way up there.

04:05.167 --> 04:06.866
Okay, I'm gonna roll one of your

04:06.867 --> 04:07.899
pant legs up and then put these

04:07.900 --> 04:09.367
little pads on there for you.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.632
Now you're gonna feel some of these

04:16.632 --> 04:18.267
electrical impulses,
but they won't be bad.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.866
And you didn't feel any

04:29.867 --> 04:31.333
light-headedness during your stumbling?

04:31.700 --> 04:32.900
No.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.332
My hands and feet felt a little numb

04:35.333 --> 04:37.699
and my legs are still weak,

04:37.700 --> 04:40.133
but I didn't have
breakfast this morning.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.367
Okay, you can roll your pant leg down.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.632
Now this meter here,
it's measuring the speed

04:45.633 --> 04:46.999
at which the electrical impulses

04:47.000 --> 04:48.500
are traveling through your nerves.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.333
Now in your case, they are traveling...

04:51.867 --> 04:53.267
Slower than they should be.

04:53.567 --> 04:54.966
This is usually indicating that you have

04:54.967 --> 04:56.532
some sort of abnormal pressure

04:56.533 --> 04:58.267
on the nerves in your legs there.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.400
I'd like to order an MRI and
some additional blood work.

05:04.033 --> 05:05.399
We'll call you as soon
as we get the results.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.000
Should I be worried?

05:08.133 --> 05:09.833
Now what good would that do?

06:25.267 --> 06:26.832
Jacob, hey, you get taller

06:26.833 --> 06:28.267
every time I see you.

06:28.667 --> 06:29.800
What can I say?

06:30.100 --> 06:31.333
All right, climb in.

06:34.833 --> 06:37.500
So how is school?

06:37.933 --> 06:38.666
The same.

06:38.667 --> 06:39.599
Same?

06:39.600 --> 06:40.899
Are you still playing baseball?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.432
Yeah, but my coach doesn't

06:42.433 --> 06:44.000
play me very often.

06:44.633 --> 06:46.266
I'm glad to hear that, I would hate to

06:46.267 --> 06:48.600
see that perfect smile
get ruined by a ball.

06:51.167 --> 06:52.332
My dad's gonna let me try out

06:52.333 --> 06:53.899
for pee wee football next year.

06:53.900 --> 06:54.866
Football?!

06:54.867 --> 06:56.866
Hey no, why don't you try

06:56.867 --> 06:58.367
out for the Chess Club?

06:58.600 --> 06:59.533
The what?

07:01.067 --> 07:02.432
Never mind.

07:02.433 --> 07:03.966
All right, let's get a look
at those pearly whites

07:03.967 --> 07:06.100
while you still got them.

07:18.167 --> 07:19.066
Are you okay?

07:19.067 --> 07:20.300
I don't think so.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.733
Someone help!

08:01.167 --> 08:03.333
I can still smell you in these.

08:04.700 --> 08:05.967
Those old things?

08:06.433 --> 08:07.800
You should throw them away.

08:08.133 --> 08:09.267
Never.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.499
I thought you were gonna

08:11.500 --> 08:12.867
clean out this old place.

08:14.267 --> 08:15.633
I haven't had time.

08:16.067 --> 08:17.933
The house takes a lot of upkeep.

08:18.767 --> 08:19.899
Why don't you get some help?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.500
I've been thinking about it.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.400
You know what next week is?

08:25.367 --> 08:28.167
Of course, it's our anniversary.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.300
It's the only date I care to remember.

08:34.866 --> 08:36.533
I miss holding you.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.299
We'll be together again.

08:39.832 --> 08:42.567
I know, someday.

08:44.267 --> 08:45.433
GBS?

08:45.700 --> 08:47.966
Yes, Guillain-Barre Syndrome.

08:47.967 --> 08:49.367
It's an auto immune disorder.

08:51.267 --> 08:53.399
It's pretty rare, but most patients

08:53.400 --> 08:55.067
find they get a full recovery.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.167
What causes it?

08:58.800 --> 09:00.067
We're really not sure.

09:00.867 --> 09:02.799
Basically your immune cells
begin to attack

09:02.800 --> 09:04.266
your healthy cells mistaking them

09:04.267 --> 09:07.267
for some foreign invader like bacteria.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.532
Then your nerve cells become damaged to

09:09.533 --> 09:11.266
the point where they can't communicate

09:11.267 --> 09:12.800
properly with your muscles.

09:13.967 --> 09:15.633
Can I take medication for it?

09:16.133 --> 09:17.867
Not in the traditional sense.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.599
The recovery process
can take a few months

09:21.600 --> 09:24.032
and depending on the severity,

09:24.033 --> 09:25.900
could take up to a year.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.566
But again, with physical therapy,

09:29.567 --> 09:33.267
98% of our patients see a full recovery.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.100
What about the other 2%?

09:38.667 --> 09:41.033
Some never recover.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.332
You'll need to be moved to a quiet,

09:44.333 --> 09:46.900
stress free environment
under full supervision.

09:48.567 --> 09:50.300
Do you know somebody who can help you?

09:51.667 --> 09:53.800
All my friends work full time.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.967
My grandmother has a cabin up North.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.432
Maybe I could stay with her?

10:04.433 --> 10:06.166
Is your grandmother capable

10:06.167 --> 10:07.933
of caring for you at this level?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.433
I guess, I haven't seen her in awhile.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.500
I don't think you understand.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.767
This is a very debilitating disease.

10:16.067 --> 10:17.099
It's likely that things are gonna

10:17.100 --> 10:18.600
get worse before they get better.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.500
I don't really have anyone else.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.667
Our other option is
a skilled nursing facility.

10:28.967 --> 10:30.499
A nursing home?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.800
No, it's an assisted care environment.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.099
They'll help you with eating, walking,

10:35.100 --> 10:36.899
bathing, etc, etc...

10:36.900 --> 10:38.367
No, no, no.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.967
Why don't you give your
grandmother a call right now?

11:41.500 --> 11:42.300
Hello?

11:42.733 --> 11:44.900
Grandma, it's Rachel.

11:45.433 --> 11:46.333
Who?

11:46.600 --> 11:47.833
Rachel!

11:48.400 --> 11:49.500
Your granddaughter.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.367
Hello sweetie, how are you?

11:52.667 --> 11:54.267
Fine, fine, I'm just fine.

11:54.733 --> 11:57.600
Listen, I need to ask a favor of you.

11:58.267 --> 12:00.133
Well of course, anything.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.932
I'm going to be laid up for a bit

12:03.933 --> 12:07.633
and I need a place where I can go...

12:09.133 --> 12:10.266
Where someone can keep an eye

12:10.267 --> 12:11.833
on me while I recover.

12:12.133 --> 12:13.300
Recover?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.167
What's wrong?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.567
I just...

12:16.900 --> 12:18.466
I just caught a little something

12:18.467 --> 12:20.267
and I need a place to stay.

12:21.100 --> 12:24.000
If it's too much trouble
I can ask somebody else.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.832
Nonsense, I would love to

12:26.833 --> 12:28.500
have you visit me.

12:28.767 --> 12:29.932
Are you sure it's okay?

12:29.933 --> 12:32.800
I have all the room in the world!

12:34.100 --> 12:35.533
When are you coming?

12:37.700 --> 12:39.032
I'm not sure yet, I'll have

12:39.033 --> 12:40.400
to let you know later.

12:40.733 --> 12:42.800
That is so good, Rachel.

12:44.033 --> 12:45.932
You know, I'll be saying a prayer

12:45.933 --> 12:47.700
for you in the meantime.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.133
Thanks, grandma.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.833
See you soon.

14:18.633 --> 14:19.767
Hello?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.432
Hi grandma, it's Rachel.

14:21.433 --> 14:23.599
Well Rachel, how are you?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.266
Well I've been better.

14:25.267 --> 14:26.766
Well you know I hadn't heard from you

14:26.767 --> 14:28.732
in awhile and I was hoping you

14:28.733 --> 14:30.266
hadn't forgotten about our visit.

14:30.267 --> 14:32.099
Can you meet me at the doctor's office?

14:32.100 --> 14:33.399
Of course!

14:33.400 --> 14:34.599
At 11 o'clock?

14:34.600 --> 14:36.100
Okay, hang on.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.132
They're gonna release me Thursday,

14:38.133 --> 14:39.700
let me give you the address.

14:42.267 --> 14:43.032
Okay.

14:43.033 --> 14:45.033
5717...

16:15.467 --> 16:16.733
Is she here yet?

16:18.600 --> 16:21.100
Okay, just make sure we know
when she gets here.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.500
Hello?

16:37.800 --> 16:39.367
Rachel, it's your grandma!

16:39.700 --> 16:40.900
Is everything okay?

16:41.267 --> 16:43.099
I'm sorry, I can't hear you,

16:43.100 --> 16:44.667
there's cars going by!

16:46.533 --> 16:50.033
I've lost the address,
can you give it to me again?

16:51.267 --> 16:53.966
I looked everywhere, I looked here,

16:53.967 --> 16:57.800
I looked everywhere and I can't find it.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.067
It's 5717 East Crestmont.

17:01.467 --> 17:05.067
Okay, hang on, I gotta
get this pen to write.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.133
Oh there it is, okay!

17:08.633 --> 17:11.000
5717...

17:11.300 --> 17:12.467
Okay!

17:13.933 --> 17:16.367
Well that sounds, that sounds like it!

17:17.800 --> 17:21.532
Okay, well I'll be there in a jiffy.

18:35.300 --> 18:36.367
Grandma?

18:36.800 --> 18:37.800
Rachel?

18:38.300 --> 18:39.466
I'm Doctor Brennan.

18:39.467 --> 18:42.667
Rose Whiteman, Rachel's grandmother.

18:44.567 --> 18:46.367
What's wrong with her?

18:47.400 --> 18:49.567
I haven't really told her yet.

18:51.267 --> 18:53.033
Rachel has an auto immune disorder.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.800
She's gonna need constant
care over the next month.

18:56.267 --> 18:57.499
In addition to physical therapy

18:57.500 --> 18:59.300
which she should start immediately.

19:00.933 --> 19:03.933
I understand she's going
to be in your care.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.467
Yes.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.967
We have so much catching up to do.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.532
Is there anyone else living

19:12.533 --> 19:13.967
in your home besides you?

19:14.367 --> 19:17.266
No, just me, but it'll be nice

19:17.267 --> 19:18.767
and quiet for Rachel.

19:19.267 --> 19:21.367
Miss Whitman, I need to be frank.

19:22.267 --> 19:23.399
Rachel's rehab is gonna

19:23.400 --> 19:25.432
be very strenuous on both her

19:25.433 --> 19:27.033
and her caregiver.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.833
It's a very physically
demanding responsibility.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.332
Oh I remember years ago when Rachel

19:33.333 --> 19:36.867
would come to my house,
she would stay for weeks.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.666
Is there any other family member

19:39.667 --> 19:40.899
that you're aware of that can

19:40.900 --> 19:42.433
possibly take you in?

19:43.033 --> 19:44.300
Not really, no.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.132
She's gonna need help bathing,

19:47.133 --> 19:49.399
eating, walking, we're talking

19:49.400 --> 19:51.133
around the clock supervision here.

19:51.933 --> 19:55.733
Doctor, let me be frank with you.

19:56.967 --> 20:01.100
Do not be fooled by my age
or this walking stick.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.432
I have lived alone for quite awhile

20:04.433 --> 20:06.933
and I am very capable.

20:07.867 --> 20:09.100
Besides...

20:11.400 --> 20:14.467
God will give her all
the strength she needs.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.366
Thank you for doing this
for me, grandma.

20:26.367 --> 20:28.100
It's my pleasure.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.099
It's been a long time since you've

20:30.100 --> 20:31.467
been up to the cabin.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.933
Look at the price of gas!

20:34.367 --> 20:35.967
I know, it's always going up.

20:36.433 --> 20:40.433
The last time I got it,
it was $2 a gallon.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.200
When was that?

20:42.433 --> 20:43.867
A couple of years ago.

20:44.067 --> 20:45.500
I don't drive too much.

20:45.933 --> 20:48.767
The people, they just drive too fast.

20:50.033 --> 20:51.733
Do you have air conditioning?

20:52.067 --> 20:54.567
Oh yes, and heat too.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.132
Can we turn it on?

20:56.133 --> 20:57.299
The heat?!

20:57.300 --> 20:59.700
No, the air conditioning.

20:59.933 --> 21:01.400
Oh, sure.

21:01.733 --> 21:02.832
No no, wait!

21:04.867 --> 21:06.333
That feels like the heat.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.133
It takes a minute.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.800
Oh...

21:26.533 --> 21:28.433
One of my red lights just came on.

21:30.167 --> 21:31.567
We'd better pull over.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.633
I'd better see what the manual says.

21:48.167 --> 21:49.067
Who?

21:49.367 --> 21:50.900
The owner's manual.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.400
Oh!

22:10.100 --> 22:12.067
The manual says you've overheated!

22:17.367 --> 22:19.267
I think I fixed the horn!

22:58.500 --> 22:59.567
We're here!

23:01.033 --> 23:02.100
We're here?

23:02.600 --> 23:03.499
Yeah.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.467
Well then why'd you stop?

23:05.700 --> 23:07.500
Well you told me to pull over.

23:46.533 --> 23:47.500
Okay.

24:07.333 --> 24:08.467
And another one.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.333
We can do this, we can do this.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.767
Let me open the gate.

24:19.067 --> 24:21.067
Come on, put your arm around me.

24:22.167 --> 24:23.500
All right, come on.

24:27.167 --> 24:27.933
Okay.

24:32.033 --> 24:33.700
That wasn't so bad.

24:50.133 --> 24:51.633
I'm parched.

24:52.333 --> 24:53.700
I bet you are too.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.133
Ooh boy.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.500
I'm really tired, I think
I'd like to go to bed now.

25:35.967 --> 25:37.100
Of course.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.400
Let me take you to your room.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.867
No, no, I can do it.

25:53.333 --> 25:54.400
Okay.

26:26.267 --> 26:28.667
Let me just go get your bag.

27:25.133 --> 27:26.367
Pastor Russell.

27:26.567 --> 27:29.399
Well hello Pastor, this is Rose Whitman.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.899
Well hello Rose, how are you today?

27:31.900 --> 27:33.432
Oh I'm doing just fine,

27:33.433 --> 27:35.733
busy doing the Lord's work.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.800
But I need some help.

27:38.133 --> 27:39.366
Sure, how can I help?

27:39.367 --> 27:41.499
My granddaughter is staying with me

27:41.500 --> 27:44.432
a bit and I need a handyman to come

27:44.433 --> 27:46.600
and build a ramp for her wheelchair.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.832
Would you happen to know anybody

27:48.833 --> 27:50.532
that could do that job?

27:50.533 --> 27:52.099
I do, I do, we have a young man

27:52.100 --> 27:53.666
here who's been working at the church,

27:53.667 --> 27:54.867
he's quite handy.

27:55.267 --> 27:56.400
Wonderful!

27:56.667 --> 27:57.999
Is he working today?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.533
He is, we had lunch earlier.

27:59.800 --> 28:00.999
I'll just come on over

28:01.000 --> 28:02.766
and see if he's interested in the job.

28:02.767 --> 28:05.833
Super, I will tell him to
expect you, his name is Ben.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.699
Oh thank you, Pastor.

28:07.700 --> 28:09.300
I'll see you in a bit.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.132
Hi, are you Ben?!

28:35.133 --> 28:36.300
Yes, ma'am.

28:36.633 --> 28:38.167
Hi, I'm Rose Whitman.

28:38.533 --> 28:39.632
Pastor Russell suggested

28:39.633 --> 28:41.000
that I get a hold of you.

28:41.267 --> 28:42.500
Oh yes, he told me.

28:42.767 --> 28:44.299
I live on just down the road and I

28:44.300 --> 28:45.833
need some work on my home.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.600
Would you be interested?

28:48.133 --> 28:49.500
Sure, what do you need?

28:49.967 --> 28:51.332
Well I need a wheelchair ramp

28:51.333 --> 28:52.833
for my granddaughter.

28:53.167 --> 28:54.933
She's about your age.

28:56.933 --> 28:58.967
Well now I don't want any charity!

28:59.367 --> 29:01.467
I will pay for all of the services.

29:02.867 --> 29:05.433
The church keeps me
really busy right now.

29:05.967 --> 29:07.700
I could really use your help.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.800
Well here's my telephone
number and address.

29:13.733 --> 29:15.833
Perhaps if you could find some time.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.067
It was nice to meet you.

29:18.833 --> 29:19.833
You too.

31:29.433 --> 31:31.367
It's good to see Rachel again.

31:31.833 --> 31:33.867
Been quite some time
since we've seen her.

31:34.433 --> 31:37.299
Yes, but I'm exhausted and

31:37.300 --> 31:39.433
it's only her first day here.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.267
How long is she gonna stay?

31:41.767 --> 31:43.100
It could be a month.

31:45.533 --> 31:47.133
That sounds about right.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.067
I think I've bitten off
more than I can chew.

31:50.467 --> 31:52.767
God will give ya the strength
to see it through.

31:53.167 --> 31:54.600
Got any pull up there?

31:55.700 --> 31:57.267
I could use some help.

31:57.767 --> 31:59.167
I'll see what I can do.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.533
She's beautiful.

32:02.367 --> 32:04.533
She looks just like Katherine.

32:04.900 --> 32:06.567
They get their looks from you.

32:08.967 --> 32:11.166
I suspect that she'll wanna

32:11.167 --> 32:12.667
talk about her mother.

32:13.733 --> 32:15.267
What do I tell her?

32:15.500 --> 32:16.633
The truth.

32:18.600 --> 32:19.933
You're right.

32:22.167 --> 32:23.500
I sure miss you.

32:24.033 --> 32:25.667
I miss you too, darling.

32:48.967 --> 32:49.799
Hello?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.067
Hello, Miss Whiteman?

32:51.433 --> 32:52.433
Yes?

32:52.700 --> 32:54.333
Yeah, it's Ben from church.

32:55.433 --> 32:59.267
Ben, how are you?

32:59.600 --> 33:00.967
I'm fine.

33:01.767 --> 33:02.832
You know, I actually wanted to help

33:02.833 --> 33:04.600
you out with that ramp tomorrow.

33:05.067 --> 33:06.933
Oh that is wonderful.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.300
Say around seven?

33:09.733 --> 33:12.467
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

33:13.267 --> 33:15.867
And Ben, thank you.

33:16.900 --> 33:18.067
You're welcome.

33:30.333 --> 33:31.633
Dinner's ready.

33:32.167 --> 33:33.567
I hope you're hungry.

33:34.833 --> 33:36.600
I don't really feel like getting up.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.433
Do you think you could bring it in here?

33:39.933 --> 33:41.832
Oh no, honey, you've been in

33:41.833 --> 33:44.500
this bed for four hours.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.333
It would do you good to get up.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.667
Here, let me help you.

33:51.433 --> 33:52.800
You can do it.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.599
Do you remember when I used to

33:55.600 --> 33:57.266
make chicken noodle soup for you

33:57.267 --> 33:58.700
when you were little?

34:01.067 --> 34:02.267
Vaguely.

34:02.633 --> 34:04.500
You refused to sit in a high chair.

34:05.167 --> 34:06.532
I would take phone books and put them

34:06.533 --> 34:09.699
under you so you could sit at the table.

34:10.567 --> 34:11.900
I don't remember that.

34:13.367 --> 34:15.933
You couldn't have been
maybe three or four.

34:16.632 --> 34:18.667
You were such a tiny little thing.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.467
Your mother used to do that.

34:38.867 --> 34:40.931
When you were done, you would sit

34:40.933 --> 34:42.699
on the floor and play with your dolls

34:42.699 --> 34:45.033
for hours on end.

34:45.867 --> 34:47.099
You would change their clothes

34:47.100 --> 34:50.667
over and over, you were so adorable.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.333
I wish I could remember that.

34:55.033 --> 34:57.500
The Millers lived two doors down.

34:58.267 --> 35:00.299
Their boys would ride their mini bikes

35:00.300 --> 35:02.100
up and down the street.

35:04.533 --> 35:05.999
Your grandfather used to go out

35:06.000 --> 35:08.167
there and shake his fist at them!

35:11.067 --> 35:12.600
Do you like your soup?

35:13.267 --> 35:14.600
Yes, thank you.

35:15.967 --> 35:17.533
It used to be your favorite.

35:52.867 --> 35:54.300
Honey, do you need anything?

35:57.267 --> 35:58.500
I'm fine.

35:59.633 --> 36:02.833
Okay, I'll just let
you do your business.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.267
Okay, let's get your legs.

36:26.933 --> 36:28.266
Wait, where are you gonna sleep?

36:28.267 --> 36:30.433
I'll make the couch into a bed.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.633
I do that when I have guests.

36:36.033 --> 36:37.500
I'm so glad you're here.

36:39.067 --> 36:40.333
Goodnight, Rachel.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.100
Goodnight, grandma.

37:13.833 --> 37:15.267
Good morning!

37:15.567 --> 37:16.699
Morning.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.100
Thank you so much for helping me.

37:18.733 --> 37:19.667
Of course.

37:20.467 --> 37:22.967
Well, there they are.

37:29.167 --> 37:31.400
Why don't you come back tomorrow?

37:32.267 --> 37:33.567
Oh, that's nothing.

37:35.267 --> 37:36.833
These are awful steep.

37:39.833 --> 37:40.967
Wonder...

37:42.533 --> 37:43.900
Wonder if we can build it back there.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.633
Hey, whatever you think.

37:47.067 --> 37:50.500
All right, well I'll get to work.

38:28.167 --> 38:30.300
Well good morning, sleepy head.

38:30.833 --> 38:32.433
Are you ready to get up?

38:35.133 --> 38:36.500
What's all that noise?

38:37.133 --> 38:38.400
That's my handyman.

38:39.733 --> 38:42.666
Come on, let's get you all cleaned up.

38:42.667 --> 38:44.167
Come on, you can do it.

38:44.633 --> 38:45.967
Let's take the covers.

38:48.267 --> 38:49.033
Come on.

38:51.900 --> 38:53.900
Okay, there you go.

38:54.467 --> 38:57.067
I think I need some fresh clothes.

38:57.567 --> 39:00.000
No, I'll get it.

39:36.433 --> 39:38.100
I hope you're hungry.

39:40.267 --> 39:42.833
You really shouldn't
overdo yourself, honey.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.167
How'd you sleep?

39:46.167 --> 39:48.166
Very well, but I'm sorry

39:48.167 --> 39:49.800
you have to sleep on the couch.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.566
Oh honey, I fall asleep on that couch

39:52.567 --> 39:54.567
more than I do my own bed.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.367
Why don't you eat?

39:59.767 --> 40:00.833
Ben!

40:01.333 --> 40:02.500
Come on in!

40:11.533 --> 40:12.900
Let me get that for you.

40:13.267 --> 40:15.833
Ben, have you met my
lovely granddaughter Rachel?

40:18.833 --> 40:19.700
Hello.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.633
Hi.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.499
Ben, we were just getting ready to eat,

40:25.500 --> 40:27.300
can you join us?

40:28.700 --> 40:31.132
I'm okay, but I did finish the ramp

40:31.133 --> 40:33.633
if you wanna come check it out?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.766
Ben built you a ramp for your

40:36.767 --> 40:38.166
wheelchair so you could come

40:38.167 --> 40:40.000
and go as you please.

40:40.667 --> 40:42.367
I can't wait to see it.

40:49.667 --> 40:51.900
Oh that is just beautiful.

40:52.667 --> 40:53.867
How much do I owe you?

40:54.267 --> 40:55.166
Oh no no no, don't worry

40:55.167 --> 40:56.266
about it, it's okay.

40:56.267 --> 40:58.133
Oh no you don't, young man.

40:58.667 --> 41:00.399
That's very kind of you, but I doubt

41:00.400 --> 41:02.267
you're independently wealthy.

41:02.733 --> 41:04.567
Come on in and I'll pay you.

41:06.500 --> 41:09.033
I appreciate you getting
it done so quickly.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.533
Well of course.

41:11.167 --> 41:13.333
I might be needing it myself someday.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.967
Oh no no, this is way too much.

41:19.100 --> 41:21.367
Nonsense, Ben, your work
is well worth it.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.799
Besides, I might have some odd jobs

41:23.800 --> 41:25.432
for you to do in the future.

41:25.433 --> 41:26.967
Okay, well thank you.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.433
Goodbye, Ben.

41:36.700 --> 41:39.567
Why'd you go, you didn't even eat?

41:42.433 --> 41:43.966
I need to run some errands,

41:43.967 --> 41:45.667
do you wanna go with me?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.399
You could try out your new ramp.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.567
No.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.633
Well I'll be back in a little while.

41:56.167 --> 41:57.667
Don't forget to eat!

42:00.067 --> 42:02.600
Would you please close
the door when you leave?

42:06.967 --> 42:08.133
Okay.

43:01.267 --> 43:04.267
Hi honey, sorry it took so long.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.400
I think I'd like to lay down for awhile.

43:14.833 --> 43:17.500
Sure, let me help you.

43:18.367 --> 43:21.433
Okay honey, turn it like this.

43:23.733 --> 43:24.867
Here we go.

43:33.467 --> 43:36.367
Oh, I see you're getting all settled in.

43:36.967 --> 43:38.599
Yeah, I took the liberty

43:38.600 --> 43:39.933
of using the dresser.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.033
You could have used the closet.

43:50.700 --> 43:53.499
Well okay, I'll just be getting

43:53.500 --> 43:54.967
back to the kitchen.

44:39.100 --> 44:40.267
Hello, Ben?

44:40.800 --> 44:42.933
Hi, this is Rose.

44:44.267 --> 44:46.000
Oh I'm okay.

44:47.100 --> 44:50.467
Yeah, I was wondering...

44:52.767 --> 44:53.799
If you'd like to come over

44:53.800 --> 44:56.767
and do some other things for me.

44:57.967 --> 45:00.633
Oh, whenever you have the time.

45:01.367 --> 45:02.367
Yeah.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.133
Grandma!

45:05.800 --> 45:06.767
Okay.

45:07.067 --> 45:09.100
Oh Ben, that is so great.

45:09.700 --> 45:11.033
I'll see you then.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.767
Thanks, Ben!

45:17.400 --> 45:19.367
I just wanna go to the bathroom.

45:32.800 --> 45:33.566
Are you okay?

45:33.567 --> 45:34.733
I'm okay.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.800
I just woke up with a kink, I'm fine.

45:57.033 --> 45:58.133
Grandma?

46:00.167 --> 46:02.500
What happened between you and Mom?

46:04.767 --> 46:06.500
It's a bit complicated.

46:09.300 --> 46:11.666
Your mother was a very complex

46:11.667 --> 46:14.467
woman as I'm sure you know.

46:18.933 --> 46:20.367
All I know is...

46:21.767 --> 46:23.467
She was very angry.

46:25.933 --> 46:28.932
When your mother was a young woman,

46:28.933 --> 46:30.566
she fell in love with this boy

46:30.567 --> 46:33.867
who was quite a ruffian.

46:35.067 --> 46:38.267
Your grandfather forbid her to see him.

46:40.533 --> 46:42.466
She snuck out one night anyway

46:42.467 --> 46:44.799
and your grandfather waited up

46:44.800 --> 46:48.333
all night for her to return.

46:51.633 --> 46:56.366
After that, he sent her off
to Sacred Heart's Academy

46:56.367 --> 46:59.433
and she lost touch with the boy.

47:02.733 --> 47:04.766
It broke her heart, but your

47:04.767 --> 47:06.732
grandfather, he ruled the house

47:06.733 --> 47:08.867
with an iron fist.

47:14.567 --> 47:18.700
He grew up to be a
prominent businessman.

47:19.367 --> 47:21.932
Very wealthy, and in fact to this

47:21.933 --> 47:25.267
day who would have guessed.

47:29.133 --> 47:31.166
She ran away form the Academy,

47:31.167 --> 47:34.133
met your father and had you.

47:37.600 --> 47:40.500
She was just a child herself.

47:43.300 --> 47:45.066
She wouldn't marry your father

47:45.067 --> 47:47.867
no matter how much we pleaded.

47:48.567 --> 47:51.267
She wouldn't make it
right with the church.

47:52.267 --> 47:56.033
After that, she just cut us off.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.267
What if you...

48:00.367 --> 48:02.400
What if you had to do it over again?

48:04.267 --> 48:09.267
Would you choose your
daughter or the church?

48:11.867 --> 48:13.367
I didn't like it.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.766
I didn't wanna lose my daughter,

48:15.767 --> 48:18.833
but it has to be right with the Lord.

48:23.967 --> 48:25.800
Then the accident happened.

48:46.400 --> 48:47.700
I'm sorry.

48:51.300 --> 48:53.500
Oh, let's just...

48:56.067 --> 48:57.499
Let me get these dishes,

48:57.500 --> 48:58.699
you go on to bed and I'll

48:58.700 --> 49:00.333
take care of everything.

49:02.967 --> 49:04.567
You need your rest.

49:05.367 --> 49:06.933
I'll be in to tuck you in.

49:18.267 --> 49:19.399
Rachel!

49:19.400 --> 49:21.833
You got in bed by yourself!

49:22.533 --> 49:23.766
Well I figured I'd better get

49:23.767 --> 49:26.467
healthy so I can help you into bed.

49:28.700 --> 49:29.733
Grandma.

49:31.300 --> 49:32.800
It wasn't your fault.

49:33.700 --> 49:35.467
What happened with you and Mom.

49:37.833 --> 49:39.000
Thank you.

50:55.067 --> 50:55.766
Hello?

50:55.767 --> 50:56.967
Oh, come in.

50:57.967 --> 51:00.766
Oh, hi, is your grandmother here?

51:00.767 --> 51:02.767
Oh no, she had to go out for a bit.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.267
Is there something you needed?

51:05.267 --> 51:06.666
Well I'm planting the flowers out there

51:06.667 --> 51:07.832
in the flower bed and I just

51:07.833 --> 51:08.732
don't know where they go.

51:08.733 --> 51:10.067
Oh, well maybe I can help.

51:13.133 --> 51:14.332
It's okay, don't worry about it,

51:14.333 --> 51:15.266
I'll just wait for your grandmother.

51:15.267 --> 51:16.933
It's no trouble, really.

51:18.467 --> 51:20.300
Hmm, excuse me, if I can just get...

51:22.267 --> 51:23.400
Let me help you.

51:24.767 --> 51:25.933
Thanks.

51:36.567 --> 51:38.866
So I think she'd want the petunias

51:38.867 --> 51:41.566
in the back for some height and

51:41.567 --> 51:44.799
the illicium in front for ground cover

51:44.800 --> 51:46.767
and then dianthus in the middle.

51:47.967 --> 51:49.000
I can do that.

51:49.833 --> 51:51.133
You really know your flowers.

51:53.133 --> 51:54.299
You want me to wheel you back inside?

51:54.300 --> 51:55.766
No, no, I'm fine, I've

51:55.767 --> 51:57.500
been inside for a couple of days.

51:57.667 --> 51:58.566
Feels good to get out.

51:58.567 --> 51:59.733
Okay.

52:09.867 --> 52:11.267
Thank you for building the ramp.

52:11.633 --> 52:12.700
Oh, you're welcome.

52:15.333 --> 52:16.700
It's very peaceful out here.

52:17.333 --> 52:18.132
Yeah.

52:18.133 --> 52:18.999
Oh, are you from here?

52:19.000 --> 52:21.167
Ah, no, Midwest.

52:22.067 --> 52:22.900
Where?

52:23.267 --> 52:24.166
Michigan.

52:24.167 --> 52:24.999
Oh, I don't think I could

52:25.000 --> 52:26.400
stand the winters there.

52:26.800 --> 52:27.900
They're pretty cold.

52:31.767 --> 52:32.967
So...

52:34.100 --> 52:37.800
I hear there's a lake a few miles away.

52:40.100 --> 52:41.733
Maybe you could show it to me.

52:46.267 --> 52:47.600
Okay, maybe.

52:54.733 --> 52:57.733
Well I'll let you get back to work.

53:13.633 --> 53:15.300
Oh it is just lovely.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.500
Well Rachel, look at you all dressed up.

53:20.333 --> 53:21.700
Isn't she pretty?

53:22.400 --> 53:23.633
Yeah, she's pretty.

53:25.867 --> 53:26.900
Well...

53:30.933 --> 53:32.799
Anyway, I brought this from

53:32.800 --> 53:34.800
Shirley in my Bible Study group.

53:35.267 --> 53:36.466
She broke her hip last year,

53:36.467 --> 53:38.100
but she doesn't need it.

53:39.567 --> 53:41.632
Ben did such a wonderful job

53:41.633 --> 53:43.532
on the flower garden, he put

53:43.533 --> 53:46.133
everything where I would have put it.

53:48.900 --> 53:50.399
Rose, I better get going.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.500
Oh please say you can stay for dinner.

53:52.900 --> 53:55.500
We have so much more
food than we can eat!

53:56.067 --> 53:58.432
I would love to, but I can't tonight.

53:58.433 --> 53:59.767
I'll see you tomorrow.

54:00.100 --> 54:01.267
Bye.

54:03.567 --> 54:05.566
Ben's such a good boy, isn't he?

54:05.567 --> 54:06.733
Mmmhm.

54:09.267 --> 54:11.100
You think you're ready for this?

54:11.733 --> 54:14.633
Absolutely, I'm sick of this chair.

54:17.933 --> 54:19.000
All right.

54:19.500 --> 54:20.567
You can do it.

54:41.800 --> 54:44.466
Speaking of time, you know

54:44.467 --> 54:45.933
why I'm here, don't you?

54:46.600 --> 54:47.567
Yes.

54:48.300 --> 54:49.933
It's almost time, Rose.

54:50.567 --> 54:52.632
I know, but there's something

54:52.633 --> 54:54.600
that I have to take care of first.

54:55.033 --> 54:55.933
Ben.

54:56.100 --> 54:57.733
They make a lovely couple.

54:58.100 --> 55:00.266
Ah, so that's your plan.

55:00.267 --> 55:03.567
He's a nice young man, a widower.

55:04.267 --> 55:06.832
And Rachel's biological
clock is ticking.

55:06.833 --> 55:09.600
Speaking of ticking clocks...

55:15.700 --> 55:18.299
I'm not going anywhere until

55:18.300 --> 55:20.100
those two kids are right.

55:20.667 --> 55:22.733
You'll just have to wait.

55:23.133 --> 55:24.100
Wait?

55:24.567 --> 55:26.267
There's no waiting, Rose!

55:26.700 --> 55:29.267
When it's your time, it's your time!

55:30.400 --> 55:32.032
Well I'm not leaving until

55:32.033 --> 55:33.600
I'm through with this.

55:34.067 --> 55:37.032
I'm sorry, but you'll just have to tell

55:37.033 --> 55:39.733
whomever to be patient.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.500
You are the most stubborn
woman I have ever known!

55:45.133 --> 55:46.600
Thank you, Charles.

56:08.067 --> 56:09.067
Come in!

56:10.767 --> 56:11.767
Oh my gosh.

56:12.600 --> 56:13.432
Are you okay?

56:13.433 --> 56:14.599
I'm fine.

56:14.600 --> 56:15.766
Let me help you into your chair.

56:15.767 --> 56:16.866
No, honestly, I'm fine, really.

56:16.867 --> 56:17.899
I'm fine.

56:17.900 --> 56:19.166
Okay, you sure?

56:19.167 --> 56:21.867
Yeah, yeah, is there
something you needed?

56:23.367 --> 56:24.832
Yeah, is your grandmother here?

56:24.833 --> 56:26.032
No.

56:26.033 --> 56:27.833
You know if she has a ladder anywhere?

56:30.533 --> 56:32.399
If she does, it's in the shed out back.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.599
Oh.

56:33.600 --> 56:34.833
Yeah, there's a key on the shelf.

56:35.767 --> 56:37.000
Oh, okay.

56:37.767 --> 56:38.766
Are you sure you're okay?

56:38.767 --> 56:39.832
Yes, I'm sure I'm fine.

56:39.833 --> 56:40.933
Okay.

56:45.267 --> 56:46.267
Got it.

57:29.567 --> 57:30.733
Come in!

57:33.933 --> 57:34.599
Hi.

57:34.600 --> 57:35.532
Hi.

57:35.533 --> 57:36.666
Can you tell your grandmother

57:36.667 --> 57:37.900
that I finished everything on her list?

57:38.633 --> 57:40.066
Oh, you're all done here?

57:40.067 --> 57:43.367
Yeah, for today, but
I'll be back tomorrow.

57:43.733 --> 57:44.733
Oh great!

57:45.167 --> 57:47.100
I mean great, yeah.

57:48.800 --> 57:49.867
Okay, well...

57:51.100 --> 57:52.032
I'll see you later.

57:52.033 --> 57:53.000
Bye.

58:38.267 --> 58:39.533
Hi, honey!

58:39.933 --> 58:41.299
Oh, Ben said to tell you that

58:41.300 --> 58:42.567
he'd be back tomorrow.

58:43.067 --> 58:45.933
Oh that's wonderful!

58:48.167 --> 58:49.633
You like him, don't you?

58:51.467 --> 58:52.833
He's all right.

58:53.500 --> 58:55.433
He reminds me of your grandfather.

58:55.900 --> 58:58.400
The strong silent type.

59:00.733 --> 59:02.667
I have something to show you.

59:18.667 --> 59:21.333
That is unbelievable!

59:21.933 --> 59:24.666
And now, I'm going to the

59:24.667 --> 59:27.633
bathroom all by myself.

59:28.833 --> 59:30.533
Did Rose Whitman get a hold of you?

59:30.900 --> 59:32.399
Yes she did, I built her a ramp

59:32.400 --> 59:33.899
and then I did some other things around

59:33.900 --> 59:35.366
the house that she needed.

59:35.367 --> 59:36.799
I appreciate that.

59:36.800 --> 59:38.399
Thank you, she just has not been

59:38.400 --> 59:40.267
the same since her husband passed.

59:40.867 --> 59:42.500
You met her granddaughter?

59:42.933 --> 59:45.067
Yeah, I did.

59:48.267 --> 59:49.600
She's very pretty.

59:54.800 --> 59:56.533
She reminds me of Sarah.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.766
I have a really hard time

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.467
looking at her in that wheelchair.

01:00:06.167 --> 01:00:07.800
Well that's understandable.

01:00:08.467 --> 01:00:10.500
Sounds like you might
be quite fond of her.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.433
I'm not ready for a relationship.

01:00:18.933 --> 01:00:20.199
What is it you're afraid of?

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.767
I can't go through that pain again.

01:00:22.367 --> 01:00:25.567
Ben, pain is part of living,
you can't fear it.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:27.699
You think Christ feared pain

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.867
when He died on the cross for our sins?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.300
I don't know.

01:00:33.667 --> 01:00:36.732
You know, I recently read where people

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:39.166
said as they get older they have

01:00:39.167 --> 01:00:41.266
more regrets for the things
they didn't do

01:00:41.267 --> 01:00:43.467
than for the things they did.

01:00:46.167 --> 01:00:49.233
Open your heart and take a chance.

01:00:57.133 --> 01:00:58.267
Hello?

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.267
Oh yes, she's here.

01:01:03.267 --> 01:01:04.300
Is it the doctor?

01:01:04.567 --> 01:01:06.000
No, it's Ben.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.400
Hello?

01:01:12.267 --> 01:01:13.067
Hi.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.267
Oh.

01:01:20.467 --> 01:01:23.667
No, no, this morning's fine.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:29.967
Okay, bye.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.767
What did he want?

01:01:34.567 --> 01:01:36.100
He wants to take me to the lake.

01:01:36.933 --> 01:01:39.267
I think he likes you.

01:01:39.567 --> 01:01:41.266
He just wants to show me the lake.

01:01:41.267 --> 01:01:42.632
Your grandfather and I used to go to

01:01:42.633 --> 01:01:45.900
the lake all the time
when we were young.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.532
Oh my gosh, it's nine.

01:01:47.533 --> 01:01:49.267
Okay, I have to get ready.

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:09.967
Rachel, Ben's here!

01:02:12.067 --> 01:02:12.899
Come on in.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.766
Hi, Ben.

01:02:13.767 --> 01:02:14.700
Hey.

01:02:15.367 --> 01:02:16.499
My husband used to take me to

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.900
the lake years ago.

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:20.800
You cannot imagine
the memories that I have.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.800
You look beautiful.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.300
Are you ready?

01:02:42.733 --> 01:02:43.667
Sure.

01:02:44.267 --> 01:02:45.432
Have her back in a couple hours?

01:02:45.433 --> 01:02:46.333
Okay.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.033
I really think that I should
have brought the chair.

01:03:25.533 --> 01:03:26.800
You know what, I got an idea.

01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:32.966
Oh gosh, I'm too heavy!

01:03:32.967 --> 01:03:34.499
Hey, I'll stop if I get tired.

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.533
Okay.

01:03:53.267 --> 01:03:55.433
You know my mother
used to make apple pie.

01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:59.032
When I was a little girl I would,

01:03:59.033 --> 01:04:00.366
the smell of it would wake me up

01:04:00.367 --> 01:04:01.832
and I would run down to the kitchen

01:04:01.833 --> 01:04:03.032
and I would say mommy mommy,

01:04:03.033 --> 01:04:04.499
I want a piece of pie and she would

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.333
say what, for breakfast?

01:04:07.167 --> 01:04:09.366
I would say yeah, so she would cut me

01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:12.267
a big slice of apple pie
with a glass of milk.

01:04:14.133 --> 01:04:16.533
Now every time I eat
an apple I think of her.

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.300
It's funny, I never got the recipe.

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:22.999
I guess I always thought that

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.900
the pies would just be there.

01:04:26.433 --> 01:04:27.932
But then the accident happened

01:04:27.933 --> 01:04:30.833
and she took the recipe with her.

01:04:33.133 --> 01:04:34.900
Your grandma probably
taught her how to make it.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.067
You could probably ask
her for the recipe.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.900
I never thought of that.

01:04:41.633 --> 01:04:42.600
Okay.

01:04:43.167 --> 01:04:44.600
Come on.

01:04:45.267 --> 01:04:45.999
Hey!

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.867
It's gorgeous here.

01:05:02.467 --> 01:05:03.967
You should see it on a full moon.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.399
You can see ducks on the water

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.633
over a half mile away.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.500
Wow, I bet it's beautiful.

01:05:11.467 --> 01:05:12.600
Yeah it is.

01:05:14.133 --> 01:05:15.366
You know this lake was formed by

01:05:15.367 --> 01:05:17.067
an old quarry over a hundred years ago.

01:05:18.667 --> 01:05:20.567
It's one of the deepest
lakes in the country.

01:05:21.267 --> 01:05:23.800
Oh, okay, yeah, I don't swim so good.

01:05:25.067 --> 01:05:26.032
I'll save you.

01:05:26.033 --> 01:05:27.266
Oh.

01:05:27.267 --> 01:05:29.699
Okay, so I take it this is

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.900
where you bring all your girlfriends.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.166
No, I've actually only brought

01:05:35.167 --> 01:05:36.800
one other woman here.

01:05:39.267 --> 01:05:40.433
My wife.

01:05:42.933 --> 01:05:46.166
She died, but we were trying

01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:49.267
to start a life together
and build a family.

01:05:53.967 --> 01:05:54.966
Some things just don't work

01:05:54.967 --> 01:05:58.767
out like you planned, you know?

01:06:02.733 --> 01:06:04.832
I've been thinking about
starting over somewhere else,

01:06:04.833 --> 01:06:08.267
but I just can't bear to leave.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.700
There's just something about this place.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.700
I'm sorry.

01:06:17.367 --> 01:06:19.467
It's okay, it's been awhile.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.267
I shouldn't feel sorry for myself.

01:06:25.767 --> 01:06:26.699
Can I ask you something?

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:27.833
Yeah, sure.

01:06:29.267 --> 01:06:30.500
What happened to you?

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.267
Oh, it's just temporary, I...

01:06:37.267 --> 01:06:39.567
I should be perfectly
fine in a month or so.

01:06:39.933 --> 01:06:41.500
How long have you been
living with your grandma?

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.867
Oh gosh, just like a few days.

01:06:45.433 --> 01:06:48.533
I just needed someplace
quiet to recover.

01:06:55.033 --> 01:06:56.366
You know, I've been so busy

01:06:56.367 --> 01:06:59.267
living in the city with my career,

01:07:00.533 --> 01:07:02.299
I can't remember the last time

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:06.433
I just sat and looked at a lake.

01:07:08.267 --> 01:07:09.500
It's really...

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.100
Intoxicating?

01:07:14.433 --> 01:07:15.366
You're getting some sun,

01:07:15.367 --> 01:07:16.600
we should probably get you in.

01:07:20.767 --> 01:07:22.267
You know, I wanna do this again.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.700
Me too.

01:07:24.167 --> 01:07:25.400
Oh wait wait wait wait wait.

01:07:57.567 --> 01:07:58.799
Well that's not a bad thing, Rose,

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.933
I mean God has a way of
getting our attention.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.032
Oh.

01:08:08.033 --> 01:08:09.533
Oh gosh.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.066
Pastor Russel.

01:08:14.067 --> 01:08:14.900
Ben.

01:08:15.733 --> 01:08:16.966
You must be Rachel.

01:08:16.966 --> 01:08:19.500
Your grandmother speaks
very highly of you.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.800
Nice to meet you.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.732
I think I'm gonna get going.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:25.267
I was just leaving myself,
I'll join you.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.732
Rachel, you oughta think about

01:08:26.733 --> 01:08:27.932
coming to services on Sunday,

01:08:27.933 --> 01:08:29.332
we'd love to have you.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.666
I'm sure Ben would be more than

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:32.332
happy to bring you, right Ben?

01:08:34.733 --> 01:08:35.933
Yeah, sure.

01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:37.733
Good.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.600
Rose, always a pleasure.

01:08:40.267 --> 01:08:41.265
Rachel, nice to have met you.

01:08:41.267 --> 01:08:42.767
Ben, after you.

01:08:57.567 --> 01:08:58.899
Grandma?

01:09:01.133 --> 01:09:02.300
Grandma!

01:09:10.033 --> 01:09:11.267
I can't move.

01:09:12.633 --> 01:09:13.631
What do you mean, honey?

01:09:13.633 --> 01:09:15.633
I can't move!

01:09:18.133 --> 01:09:19.332
Let me call 911.

01:09:19.332 --> 01:09:21.567
No, it'll pass.

01:09:22.466 --> 01:09:23.700
What can I do?

01:09:25.267 --> 01:09:26.066
I'll call Ben.

01:09:26.067 --> 01:09:27.033
No!

01:09:28.267 --> 01:09:29.500
Just help me up.

01:09:34.867 --> 01:09:35.832
I'll be right back.

01:09:35.832 --> 01:09:37.100
No, don't go.

01:09:37.867 --> 01:09:38.966
I'm scared.

01:09:39.433 --> 01:09:41.033
I'm going to go get some help.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Charles!

01:10:02.267 --> 01:10:03.466
Charles?

01:10:03.467 --> 01:10:04.900
Charles!

01:10:05.233 --> 01:10:06.900
I can't find the key!

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.100
What was that yelling?

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.900
I can't find the key to the shed.

01:10:15.433 --> 01:10:16.333
What?

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.167
What happened to the key?

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.032
I don't know, maybe Ben has it, why?

01:10:22.033 --> 01:10:23.667
I need to talk to Charles.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.000
Please, just help me up.

01:10:36.133 --> 01:10:37.767
Grandma, are you okay?

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:41.233
It's my back, I can't get up!

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:35.733
Grandma?

01:11:36.567 --> 01:11:38.033
I'm here, sweetie.

01:11:41.667 --> 01:11:44.033
I'm sorry I'm such a burden.

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.800
You could never be a burden to me.

01:11:50.533 --> 01:11:52.100
I love you, grandma.

01:11:52.967 --> 01:11:54.400
I love you too.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.733
Why were you calling grandpa's name?

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.133
I talk to him.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.900
You talk to grandpa?

01:12:13.533 --> 01:12:14.400
Yes.

01:12:15.667 --> 01:12:16.867
In the shed.

01:12:20.367 --> 01:12:24.467
You talk to grandpa in the shed?

01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:29.100
He's as handsome as he ever was.

01:12:30.967 --> 01:12:32.800
He's come to take me to Heaven,

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.467
but I'm not ready to go.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.267
Help!

01:12:58.633 --> 01:12:59.900
We're back here!

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.099
Oh my gosh, what happened?

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.467
Where's the key?

01:13:05.833 --> 01:13:07.500
Ben, I need the key to the shed.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:08.866
It's right here.

01:13:08.867 --> 01:13:09.866
Can you please help me up?

01:13:09.867 --> 01:13:10.900
Yes.

01:13:13.367 --> 01:13:15.467
Okay, okay, thanks.

01:13:17.533 --> 01:13:18.599
Rachel, what happened?

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.866
Talk to me.

01:13:19.867 --> 01:13:22.400
Go away, I don't want
you to see me like this.

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:23.999
I'm not going anywhere, okay,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.667
so just tell me what happened.

01:13:26.733 --> 01:13:28.900
I lied to you, that's what happened.

01:13:30.067 --> 01:13:31.499
I'm not going to get better,

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.267
I'm going to get worse.

01:13:34.133 --> 01:13:36.033
We'll get through it.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.633
We?

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:42.900
There is no we.

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:47.533
We went to the lake,
we had fun, but it's over.

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:50.633
You don't really mean this.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.267
Just...

01:13:53.133 --> 01:13:54.032
Go away!

01:13:54.033 --> 01:13:55.267
Rachel!

01:13:55.667 --> 01:13:56.899
I don't wanna see you again!

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.000
Is this what you really want?

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.267
Yes.

01:14:02.033 --> 01:14:03.567
Please go.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.499
But you don't understand,

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.533
there is no more time!

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:31.933
Don't you see?

01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:35.267
The shortness of breath,
the chest pains?

01:14:35.867 --> 01:14:38.000
I don't care about any of that!

01:14:38.367 --> 01:14:41.667
I am not leaving those kids like this!

01:14:42.167 --> 01:14:44.433
You don't have a say in it, Rose!

01:14:44.933 --> 01:14:46.400
Oh yes I do!

01:14:46.933 --> 01:14:48.732
I am not going to leave them,

01:14:48.733 --> 01:14:50.300
I have to help them!

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.900
You can't help them!

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.300
In fact, it's just gonna get worse!

01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.167
Don't you see it?

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.500
They haven't accepted
God into their lives.

01:15:01.267 --> 01:15:02.267
That's it!

01:15:02.767 --> 01:15:04.100
That's what they need.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.266
It's too late!

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.067
If you don't come now...

01:15:11.667 --> 01:15:14.333
Rachel, I don't have much time left.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.800
What do you mean?

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.800
Just listen to me.

01:15:21.067 --> 01:15:22.266
I need you to do something that

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:24.033
your mother could never do.

01:15:24.767 --> 01:15:26.432
I watched her suffer her whole life

01:15:26.433 --> 01:15:29.300
and I don't want to see
you go through that.

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:31.267
What?

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.100
You must give yourself to the Lord.

01:15:35.067 --> 01:15:37.367
I need you to promise me that you will.

01:15:39.467 --> 01:15:40.267
Okay.

01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:41.567
No.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.100
I need you to promise me.

01:15:45.267 --> 01:15:46.467
I promise.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.333
I did what you said.

01:16:17.167 --> 01:16:19.067
I opened up my heart.

01:16:20.467 --> 01:16:23.767
Even when I knew better,
and I let somebody else in.

01:16:27.767 --> 01:16:29.933
I allowed myself to fall in love.

01:16:33.167 --> 01:16:36.400
Then your God takes it away
from me once again.

01:16:39.167 --> 01:16:40.366
So you're putting your faith

01:16:40.367 --> 01:16:43.500
in this bottle now, is that about right?

01:16:46.933 --> 01:16:48.400
Look what you've become.

01:16:51.267 --> 01:16:53.067
Aren't you tired of living like this?

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:55.600
A shell of a man?

01:16:57.067 --> 01:16:58.567
A life empty?

01:16:59.967 --> 01:17:01.132
What am I supposed to do,

01:17:01.133 --> 01:17:02.066
just start going to church and then

01:17:02.067 --> 01:17:03.533
everything's just gonna be okay?

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.267
It's not just about going to church.

01:17:06.767 --> 01:17:08.267
It's about a life change.

01:17:09.267 --> 01:17:10.732
Jesus said I come that you might

01:17:10.733 --> 01:17:12.832
have life and have it more abundantly,

01:17:12.833 --> 01:17:14.333
do you know what that means, Ben?

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.566
It means Jesus is the answer
to all your problems,

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:20.400
all you have to do is take His hand.

01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:22.533
Can you?

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.267
Will you take His hand?

01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:28.467
They bloomed.

01:19:29.133 --> 01:19:31.000
Yes, they have.
