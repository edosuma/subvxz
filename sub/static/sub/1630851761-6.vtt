of his underwear.

09:01.749 --> 09:05.628

like loose violin strings.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.297

the underwear had been to war.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.174

09:10.258 --> 09:11.842

That's rude.

-Yeah.

be going back to him.

you're embraced by the Gentiles,

-Right. It's an odd choice.

Forget the anchovies.

-I'm sorry. That sucks.
-Yeah.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.004

remindership, you own it.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.897
Anyone who's asked
to be reminded of something

has to assume the person will
die if they're not reminded.

That's a very different
idea of remindership.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.104
Oh, you're gonna be
very impressed.
Come on. Come on.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.605

in showing me tiles.

I'm gonna put these in,
and it'll be good as new.

-Yeah. That's what I do.

Why don't you send
this kid up there?

Eric's in training.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.668

-Eric is my assistant.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.878
-Send him up.
-He's not ready to go up yet.

wants to be a roofer.

-I'm looking into tattooing.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.850
Why don't you
give Larry a tattoo?

16:57.933 --> 17:00.436
Oh. I mean,
I'd be down for that.

I think I'm going to
lower the dosage,

18:52.965 --> 18:54.716
-or maybe even
cut you off entirely.
-Okay. Okay.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.552
And then I wanna stick with
the foam roller,

18:56.635 --> 18:58.512
-but I'm gonna give you
a firmer foam roller.
-Oh.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.056

you don't wanna push too hard.

Um...

19:14.528 --> 19:15.612
(CHUCKLES)

19:16.572 --> 19:18.448
All right.
Can I be honest with you?

19:18.532 --> 19:20.367
-Yeah.
-So, the first time I was here,

19:20.450 --> 19:24.496
you bent over...
and I noticed...

19:24.580 --> 19:27.624
that your underwear
was quite frayed.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.376
-Frayed?
-Frayed.

19:29.459 --> 19:30.752
-Frayed how?
-It was stringy,

19:30.836 --> 19:33.422
and you had holes in it as well.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.424
And I'm coming to the conclusion

19:35.507 --> 19:39.887
that the reason that I don't see
patients in your office--

19:39.970 --> 19:41.555
Is because of the nature
of my underwear.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.224
Yes. I think
they've stopped coming

19:44.308 --> 19:45.517
because they see your underwear

19:45.601 --> 19:48.562
and know that something's amiss,
and they stay away.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.063
You're losing a lot of business.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.565
Because look what it says
about you.

19:51.648 --> 19:54.318

19:54.401 --> 19:55.903
Who wants to see
a doctor like that?

19:55.986 --> 19:58.071
Nobody. I wouldn't want
to see that doctor.

19:58.155 --> 20:01.950
Your underwear, it's threadbare
beyond all normal usage.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.411
You gotta have
some underwear awareness.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.955
-What the hell do I do?
-Here's a good rule of thumb.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.375
Once the cotton detaches from
the elastic, they gotta go.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.337
-And are your balls dangling?
-They are.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.631
Once your balls are dangling,
it's over.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.925
So what should I do with these,
the ones that I have?

20:18.008 --> 20:19.343
Use them for emergencies only?

20:19.426 --> 20:21.303
These aren't even for
emergencies. You throw them out.

-Not really, no.

What's so hard to believe
about the virgin birth?

23:46.133 --> 23:50.011

pregnant by God all the time.

That's what makes it so special.

having sex with her, by the way?

keep herself pure for God.

what Joseph did?

and he spoke to his friend,

She's out of her fucking mind.
I gotta get out of there."

-These Jews...
-JASON: Uh-huh.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.711
...on the set,
are not for Jesus.

through the day.

as much as you want.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.186
JASON: I will shout it
from the inside.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.562
I don't care
what you say inside.

24:40.645 --> 24:44.149
-Okay. Oh, shoot. Ow. Sorry.
-LARRY: What's the matter?

24:44.232 --> 24:46.026
No, it's just
my sciatica's acting up.

24:46.109 --> 24:47.777
You need a chiropractor?
I got the guy.

24:47.861 --> 24:50.530
My back was terrible.
This guy was really helping me.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.865
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.491
That would be incredible.
You think he can fit me in like,

24:53.575 --> 24:55.202
-I don't know, maybe today?
-(SCOFFS)

24:55.285 --> 24:58.038
Uh, yes.
I think he can fit you in today.

24:58.121 --> 25:00.373
-I'll get you the number.
-Okay. Thank you so much.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.752
Yeah, I think I was doing, like,
a Norwegian accent up till now,

25:03.835 --> 25:05.170
but I'm thinking of
kinda pivoting

25:05.253 --> 25:08.256
-to more of like
a Danish accent.
-Seth. Hey.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.758
Hey, Larry.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.677
You got a toddler carrying
your shit around still?

25:12.761 --> 25:16.139
-(LAUGHS) Yeah, that was, uh,
slightly embarrassing.
-SETH: Yeah.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.933
-It's a bad look.
-I know that.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.101
-And that's why I'm here.
-SETH: Okay.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.187
Uh, to tell you that
I'm aware of that.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.397
-Great. As long as
you're aware of it.
-I'm aware.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.274
I get it, man.
It's tough out there.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.901
You wanna look relatable,
you know?

25:27.984 --> 25:30.862
That's a big part of my thing,
trust me. I'm an everyman.

25:30.946 --> 25:31.905
-An everyman?
-SETH: Yeah.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.031
Really?
Is that who you wanna be?

25:33.114 --> 25:34.866
People like an everyman,
just so you know.

25:34.950 --> 25:39.329
They may like an everyman,
but most every man
is kind of stupid.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.747
Exactly,
that's how I come across.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.999
I portray myself as stupid
so people relate to me more.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.418
-Okay, you wanna be stupid.
-I don't wanna be stupid.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.836
I want people
to think I'm stupid.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.589
I see. So you're a smart person
who's trying to appear stupid

25:49.673 --> 25:50.882
so people will like you?

25:50.966 --> 25:53.468
Yeah, and you're a nice person
appearing to be an asshole

25:53.551 --> 25:55.470
-so no one likes you?
-Yeah.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.597
Honestly, just, here's all
I have to say about it.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.766
I'm working with you.
I'm associated with you
from now on.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.518
People are saying
our names in the same sentences.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.436
-Yes.
-Try not to do things that

26:03.520 --> 26:05.939
make you very much seem
like an asshole

26:06.022 --> 26:07.440
to anyone who's looking at you.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.817
-I completely get it.
-Okay.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.652
-Just in my own defense...
-Yeah.

26:10.735 --> 26:14.322
There are certain things that
I would prefer a man doing

26:14.406 --> 26:15.949
-over a woman.
-No. Don't say that to anyone.

26:16.032 --> 26:17.409
Keep that shit
to your fucking self, man.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.160
But there are also
certain things
I prefer to having

26:19.244 --> 26:20.245
a woman over a man.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.247
-That's also bad!
-Why is that bad?

26:22.330 --> 26:24.124
-Like a massage?
-Don't say that shit.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.375
I don't want a man touching me.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.419
Larry, just stop
naming professions

26:27.502 --> 26:29.296
and which sexes should do them
and which ones shouldn't.

26:29.379 --> 26:30.588
-Okay. Okay.
-Don't do that.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.507
-All sexes can do all jobs.
-Sure. No, I know they can.

26:32.590 --> 26:33.967
But we all have
our secret preferences

26:34.050 --> 26:35.468
as to who we want to work on us
for some particular things.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.345
-Well, they should be secret.
-Let me ask you a question.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.555
-SETH: What?
-Eye doctor?

26:38.638 --> 26:41.016
I don't give a fuck.
You care who looks at your eyes?

26:41.099 --> 26:43.268
-I don't like it if...
-I'm looking at
your eyes right now!

26:43.351 --> 26:46.271
No, but you're not hovering on.
You're not an inch away from me.

26:46.354 --> 26:47.981
-It's an eye doctor!
-I don't like it.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.941
Urologist? Proctologist?

26:50.025 --> 26:52.444
-Man.
-See? That makes no sense!

26:52.527 --> 26:53.820
You don't want a man
face to face,

26:53.903 --> 26:55.405
but you want a man to stick
his finger up your fuckin' ass?

26:55.488 --> 26:57.449
You're gonna feel comfortable
with a strange woman

26:57.532 --> 26:58.783
sticking her finger up your ass?

26:58.867 --> 27:00.285
I don't give a fuck who's
sticking their finger up my ass.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.995
What kind of woman
becomes a urologist anyway?

27:02.078 --> 27:03.621
A very bright,
enterprising woman

27:03.705 --> 27:05.623
who wants to make dicks
and butts better.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.709
Okay. You know, I might
try that out.
I'm gonna try that later.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.669
-Give it a try!
-I'm gonna let you know
about that.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.379
I would text it, okay?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.464
Keep it to yourself.

27:12.547 --> 27:13.882
We don't know
each other that well.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.800
You've said 30 insane things
to me in the last few minutes.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.886
-I'm not an everyman.
-No, you're not an everyman.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.804
-I'm not an everyman.
-You are a singular man.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.306
All right. So excited
you're doing the show.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.141
-I'm excited to be
working with you.
-It's gonna be great.

27:23.224 --> 27:24.434
I look forward to Little Larry.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.894
-So glad you're doing it.
-I'm excited to do it.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.312
Like, you know,
what are you supposed to do?

27:27.395 --> 27:29.439
-They send a tiny woman to--
-Just stop talking about it!

27:29.522 --> 27:31.691
Just stop, Larry.
Walk away. Stop.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.570
LARRY: Thank you so much.

27:35.653 --> 27:37.489
My pleasure.
You need help with your bags?

27:37.572 --> 27:39.324
Absolutely not. Thank you.

27:46.664 --> 27:47.832
Come on in.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.417
I'm so glad you're gonna be
here for a couple of days.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.794
I really appreciate it.

27:50.877 --> 27:51.878
-Thank you.
-Are you kidding me?

27:51.961 --> 27:53.922
Just leave that there.
Come on in.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.716
-Yeah, man. This is fun.
-All right.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.760
-This is gonna be great.
-Yeah. Boy.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.930
Hey, did you get
that crazy email

28:02.013 --> 28:03.640
from that chiropractor,
Jacobsen?

28:03.723 --> 28:06.476
-Yeah. I wrote it.
-You wrote his email?

28:06.559 --> 28:07.685
I wrote the email.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.938
Did you stop going to him
because of the underwear?

28:10.021 --> 28:11.064
Yeah. Exactly.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.524
-Did you see that underwear?
-Yeah, I did.

28:12.607 --> 28:13.525
Was that bizarre?

28:13.608 --> 28:14.901
Well, that's why
I wrote the email.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.152
So, are you gonna go back?

28:16.236 --> 28:17.570
I'm not going--
No, I wouldn't go back.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.239
I don't understand.
Why wouldn't you go back?

28:19.322 --> 28:20.990
It was like ancient underwear.
It was like rustic.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.992
It was like underwear that was
from the Pilgrims or something.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.702
You know, that's the sign
of a lot of washing.

28:24.786 --> 28:25.912
That's a good sign.

28:25.995 --> 28:27.580
The problem isn't just that
the underwear is frayed.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.250
It's the person that would
put everyone in that position.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.251
Yeah. You know what?
I'm thirsty.

28:31.334 --> 28:32.460
Can I get something to drink?

28:32.544 --> 28:33.753
If we stop talking
about the underwear, yeah.

28:33.837 --> 28:34.963
Yeah, please.
Knock yourself out.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.798
You got one Perrier left.
Can I have it?

28:36.881 --> 28:38.299
Well, no. Not if there's one.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.634
You're not gonna
give me the last one?

28:39.717 --> 28:41.469
The last one goes to the host,
everyone knows that.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.054
You got others. You got--
Want the orange juice?

28:43.138 --> 28:44.472
-No, I don't want that.
-Grab something else.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.640
I got the keto, I got the other.

28:45.723 --> 28:47.434
-I wanted the Perrier.
-Why would you even ask

28:47.517 --> 28:48.977
-if there's only one?
-Yeah.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.479
Anyway, I feel terrible about
the car situation.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.981
Let me do something
to help you with the car.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.108
You're still missing the car.
Let's do-- I got an app.

28:55.191 --> 28:58.069
I got a guy in Tarzana who
will drive you a car out here.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.779
-Yeah. No, that's okay.
-I'll go--

28:59.863 --> 29:02.115
I'll pick up the car
from the tow place tomorrow.

29:02.198 --> 29:03.741
-Yeah? You're sure?
-Yeah.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.034
-What would make you happy?
-I don't know.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.077
What can I do to help you?

29:06.161 --> 29:07.328
Maybe I'll have
a glass of water.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.289
The tap water is great.
I got double-- two filters.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.957
-I filter the filter.
-Is it cold?

29:11.040 --> 29:12.625
I got ice.
You put the ice in it.
It's freezing.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.335
-Nah. Ice smells.
-I have filtered ice.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.421
-It's cold, when it's in--
-It's smelly. I don't like it.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.672
What do you think
of filtered water?

29:17.755 --> 29:20.425
I was-- I was just wanted
the sparkling water.

29:20.508 --> 29:21.843
Oh! You're killing me.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.136
You should've given me
the Perrier.

29:23.219 --> 29:24.179
You know you can't ask
for the Perrier.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.680
There's gonna be Perrier
tomorrow. Okay?

29:25.763 --> 29:26.764
-Yeah.
-The car.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.057
What can I do
to make you happy with the car?

29:28.141 --> 29:29.726
-If you wanna do
something nice...
-Yes.

29:29.809 --> 29:32.228
-Go back and see Dr. Jacobsen.
-Never gonna happen.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.688
I can't get that underwear
out of my head.

29:33.771 --> 29:34.814
I'm not going to see the doctor.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.232
Okay. You know what?
I don't wanna stay here.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.484
-What are you--
-I don't wanna stay here.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.986
I'd rather the roof
falling on my head in my house

29:40.069 --> 29:40.904
than stay here.

29:40.987 --> 29:42.197
-That's extreme, Larry.
-Okay. Yeah.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.323
I don't think so.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.158
Oh, because you can't have
the last Perrier?

29:45.241 --> 29:46.326
Yeah, and you know what?

29:46.409 --> 29:48.036
Remind me never to ask you
for any more favors.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.287
Remind you?
Who'd ever sign up

29:49.370 --> 29:50.663
for a reminding gig with you.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.123
It's like a predatory contract.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.458
I wouldn't remind you
of something

29:53.541 --> 29:54.667
if we had a lawyer paper it.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.252
Why would you let me get an app?

29:56.336 --> 29:58.963
Don't do the Perrier.
That's an act
of war, the Perrier.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.048
You're better than that.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.550
-I'm calling a car service.
-Great.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.718
Call the goddamn car service.

30:03.801 --> 30:05.386
Maybe they'll have
a Perrier in the car.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.846
(DOORBELL RINGS)

30:06.930 --> 30:08.556
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.350
Hey, wait. Wait a second.
What are you doing?

30:10.433 --> 30:12.477
Hey, don't-- don't--
don't take those.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.479
I got those bags. Stop it.

30:14.562 --> 30:18.316
Hey, come on. Stop it. Hold it.
Here, here, give me those.

30:18.399 --> 30:20.610
-Gimme those, stop it.
-Let me. Get your hands off it!

30:20.693 --> 30:21.861
What are you doing?

30:21.945 --> 30:25.990
(BOTH GRUNT, CONTINUE SCUFFLING)

30:27.158 --> 30:28.993
Give me the bag, sir.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.456
(BOTH GRUNT)

30:33.540 --> 30:36.251
Look, Mommy. Mommy! That man
is beating up that woman.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.169
No, she--
she won't let me carry--

30:38.253 --> 30:39.420
They're my bags!

30:39.504 --> 30:41.089
(SCUFFLING)

30:41.172 --> 30:43.049
MOM: Oh, my God.
Honey, don't look.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.969
(BOTH CONTINUE GRUNTING,
SCREAMING)

30:56.729 --> 30:58.314
Remind me never to
drive you again.

30:58.398 --> 31:01.401
Oh, don't worry.
I own that remindership.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.444
You will never ever have to
think about that

31:03.528 --> 31:06.948
for the rest of your life.
That's on me.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.534
JASON: It's a little hard
to describe, but the way
I like to think of it is,

31:09.617 --> 31:11.869
I was in this beautiful room.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.162
-There was Judaism.
-Mm-hmm.

31:13.246 --> 31:16.249
It was just dark. And I assumed
it was a windowless room.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.585
And then Christ shows up,
and it's not windowless.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.628
It's just that the windows
are closed.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.172
And it's like, "Oh, I get it."
And everything clicked with me
and I was like,

31:23.256 --> 31:25.925
"Oh, wait! Jesus was Jewish.
Oh, wait.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.719
Everyone that wrote
the Old Testament,

31:27.802 --> 31:29.387
everyone that wrote
the New Testament,

31:29.470 --> 31:30.680
they were all Jews."

31:30.763 --> 31:34.142
And I'm doing the same things,
but the things have meaning.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.102
I actually got a pamphlet
if you're interested.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.896
Yeah, okay.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.028
Hey, Larry.
Can I borrow your charger?

31:45.862 --> 31:47.280
-Huh?
-I'm down to four percent.

31:47.363 --> 31:48.531
Well, where's your charger?

31:48.615 --> 31:49.949
I don't fucking know where
the fucking charger's at.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.576
I been trying to find it
since I was at 17 percent.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.661
I'm at nine percent.
I'm charging. I'm working.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.872
Tell you what,
give me some juice
until I get to seven,

31:55.955 --> 31:57.373
and then we'll go back
and forth, back and forth.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.791
Listen, we're not
at the bottom of the ocean

31:58.875 --> 32:01.836
sharing one tank of oxygen.
That's suicide.

32:01.919 --> 32:03.338
-We'll both die.
-Why is it suicide?

32:03.421 --> 32:05.423
-I'm at three percent.
-It's Sophie's choice.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.175
And you're the baby who's going.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.343
Where the fuck is my shit at?

32:08.426 --> 32:10.178
LARRY: Let me get to 15.
Is that too much to ask?

32:10.261 --> 32:11.846
Larry, fucking look over there.

32:11.929 --> 32:13.556
My fucking charger
is right there.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.350
And the fucking wire
is going from there

32:15.433 --> 32:17.435
up through the fucking window.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.396
-The roofer took your charger?
-You fat motherfucker!

32:20.980 --> 32:25.610
Hey! Hey! Hey!

32:25.693 --> 32:27.862
Let it go, motherfucker.
Let it go.

32:27.945 --> 32:30.698
-Come here, come here.
-Let it go, you fat bitch.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.369
-(JONAS GRUNTS)
-(LARRY YELPS)

32:46.798 --> 32:48.716
Take the rest of the day off.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.848
-(PHONE JINGLES)
-Fucking back.

32:58.601 --> 32:59.519
What are you guys looking at?

32:59.602 --> 33:01.145
Oh, you're not
gonna believe this.

33:01.604 --> 33:03.106
(BOTH GRUNT)

33:03.189 --> 33:07.860
Oh my God! Holy fuck!
That's not a good look.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.278
I'm not working with that guy.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.656
-How does this feel?
-Feels good.

33:11.739 --> 33:15.034
Ah, Larry! Who's this guy?
Who's this guy I'm working on?

33:15.118 --> 33:16.828
Look at you. You're good as new.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.621
Hey, you notice
anything different out there?

33:18.705 --> 33:20.623
Oh, you mean something
called patients?

33:20.707 --> 33:21.958
-Patients!
-Yes.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.918
Patients.
I got patients back here.

33:24.001 --> 33:26.087
-It's remarkable.
-Larry, they were so grateful

33:26.170 --> 33:27.505
that I upgraded the underwear.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.591
I'm so happy for you.
And I can't thank you enough.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.385
You did such a great job
on my back.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.512
"'I will restore you to health
and heal your wounds,'

33:34.595 --> 33:37.557
declares the Lord."
Jeremiah 30:17.

33:38.850 --> 33:39.934
What?

33:40.017 --> 33:42.061
I would love to tell you
about our Lord and Savior,

33:42.145 --> 33:44.480
Jesus Christ. I have pamphlets.

33:44.564 --> 33:45.606
Oh, fuck.
