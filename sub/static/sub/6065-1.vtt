00:38.370 --> 00:41.539
(eerie music playing)

00:51.182 --> 00:54.385
(water dripping)

01:04.995 --> 01:06.497
Did anyone see you?

01:13.772 --> 01:15.273
Don't insult me.

01:18.143 --> 01:19.343
Here.

01:21.012 --> 01:22.346
There's another list in there.

01:22.381 --> 01:24.014
I need another delivery
next week,

01:24.048 --> 01:25.650
same deal as before.

01:30.689 --> 01:32.055
Just this?

01:32.090 --> 01:33.658
It's the last of it.

01:34.426 --> 01:36.260
Listen to me.
This time it is imperative

01:36.295 --> 01:38.429
that this specimen
be as fresh as possible.

01:39.097 --> 01:43.701
Zero decay, fully intact,
no incisions. You understand?

01:43.735 --> 01:44.835
Yeah, I get it.

01:46.237 --> 01:47.838
As from now we don't
know each other.

01:47.872 --> 01:50.675
You don't acknowledge me,
you don't mention my name.

01:51.142 --> 01:53.644
You see me in the hallway,
you look the other way.

01:54.780 --> 01:55.979
Got it?

01:56.381 --> 01:58.148
Not even a cup of coffee?

01:59.884 --> 02:01.552
I'm serious, Carter.

02:04.923 --> 02:06.357
Don't worry, Doc.

02:06.391 --> 02:08.491
I'm not looking
to make any friends here.

02:09.661 --> 02:10.695
Good.

02:15.367 --> 02:16.667
Hey, Doc...

02:20.138 --> 02:21.639
Have a nice night!

02:39.157 --> 02:40.558
Morning, class.

02:40.826 --> 02:43.527
Welcome to
the Philosophy of Medicine.

02:44.295 --> 02:47.331
Victor:
What is philosophy? Anyone?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.167
Female student:
The study of wisdom.

02:50.201 --> 02:51.802
Yes, very good.

02:52.504 --> 02:53.804
Male student:
<i>The nature of existence?</i>

02:53.839 --> 02:56.340
Victor:
<i>The nature of existence.</i>

02:57.442 --> 02:59.243
What does it mean to exist?

03:00.645 --> 03:01.746
That's a tricky one, I know.

03:02.146 --> 03:04.782
It's like asking what is
the meaning of life, isn't it?

03:05.283 --> 03:08.419
Why are we here?
Why must we die?

03:09.488 --> 03:13.791
Must we die?
Where does it say we must die?

03:14.726 --> 03:15.793
<i>Obviously we,</i>

03:15.827 --> 03:17.728
<i>and that is to say</i>
<i>all living organisms,</i>

03:17.763 --> 03:19.864
<i>are bound by certain laws of physics,</i>

03:20.331 --> 03:21.932
<i>laws that ensure that we age,</i>

03:21.966 --> 03:24.869
<i>that our molecular structure</i>
<i>breaks down over time.</i>

03:25.737 --> 03:29.239
<i>Why must our shells be so</i>
<i>vulnerable to our surroundings,</i>

03:29.674 --> 03:32.276
the elements, each other?

03:32.844 --> 03:36.179
<i>These laws are against us every day,</i>

03:36.214 --> 03:38.416
<i>but laws can be broken.</i>

03:38.450 --> 03:41.619
<i>It is our job to make them obsolete.</i>

03:42.954 --> 03:46.290
So, what are we
really trying to do?

03:47.225 --> 03:49.993
We've already achieved
quite a bit, haven't we?

03:50.729 --> 03:54.064
Just look at our advances
over the past hundred years.

03:54.833 --> 03:57.267
<i>The black plague is nearly a fantasy,</i>

03:57.636 --> 03:59.970
<i>a bed time story to tell our children.</i>

04:00.972 --> 04:03.607
<i>Limbs are being fused with machines,</i>

04:03.642 --> 04:06.176
<i>science fiction is becoming reality</i>

04:06.778 --> 04:09.346
- and yet we continue to strive.
- (bubbling)

04:10.649 --> 04:12.416
Why don't we just plateau?

04:13.985 --> 04:16.587
What is it that we
are trying to achieve?

04:18.322 --> 04:19.957
Male student:  Immortality.

04:19.991 --> 04:21.425
Immortality!

04:22.193 --> 04:26.363
The nature of existence is
to continue to exist,

04:27.398 --> 04:29.567
but who continues to exist?

04:32.804 --> 04:33.804
God.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.874
The gods.

04:37.241 --> 04:38.576
The gods live forever

04:38.610 --> 04:40.978
and they are everything
we long to be.

04:41.746 --> 04:43.681
<i>Well, I have news for you.</i>

04:43.715 --> 04:47.985
<i>They're us.</i>
<i>We are them and they are us.</i>

04:48.019 --> 04:51.321
<i>God is not a boundary, it is</i>
<i>an achievement.</i>

04:57.796 --> 04:59.964
<i>Each and every one of you</i>
<i>chose this field</i>

04:59.998 --> 05:01.966
<i>because deep down you realize that</i>

05:02.000 --> 05:04.067
<i>the two most important things</i>
<i>in this world</i>

05:04.102 --> 05:07.605
are to give a life or to take a life...

05:09.340 --> 05:10.608
...and to wield that power,

05:10.642 --> 05:14.778
why that is to wield
the hand of God.

05:15.547 --> 05:21.351
(suspenseful music plays)

05:31.129 --> 05:33.631
OK, class,
I'm sure most of you know

05:33.665 --> 05:35.766
that I've been away
on an expedition in Giza

05:35.800 --> 05:37.334
for the past couple of months,

05:37.368 --> 05:38.969
so I thought
it would be pretty cool

05:39.004 --> 05:42.205
if we talked a little bit about
the great pyramids.

05:43.008 --> 05:45.242
Now everyone knows
that pyramids were tombs

05:45.276 --> 05:48.946
for ancient Egyptian kings,
but more importantly,

05:48.980 --> 05:52.282
they were a symbol of supreme power.

05:53.084 --> 05:56.520
A place where
kings transformed into gods,

05:57.522 --> 06:01.091
but how were these
divine monuments built?

06:01.125 --> 06:02.225
Aliens!

06:02.260 --> 06:03.694
(soft laughter)

06:04.195 --> 06:05.963
Aliens? Of course!

06:06.965 --> 06:09.767
Just out of curiosity,
a show of hands.

06:09.801 --> 06:14.137
How many of you actually believe
that aliens built the pyramids?

06:17.408 --> 06:18.642
Come on, guys!

06:18.910 --> 06:21.311
Do you not have any pride
in your own species,

06:21.345 --> 06:22.580
in human potential?

06:23.214 --> 06:25.983
For all the shameful things
we've done over time,

06:26.017 --> 06:28.552
this is something spectacular and
you want to take it away?

06:28.587 --> 06:30.387
But, Professor K., you've got to admit

06:30.421 --> 06:31.622
the evidence is all there.

06:32.156 --> 06:34.692
I mean we couldn't build
those things today if we wanted to,

06:34.726 --> 06:37.595
let alone 4,000 years ago.
There's no way.

06:37.629 --> 06:39.463
Look, just because
we're not building pyramids

06:39.497 --> 06:41.865
in modern society
doesn't mean we can't!

06:42.433 --> 06:43.968
Priorities have changed.

06:44.603 --> 06:45.736
I mean,
do you really think that

06:46.104 --> 06:47.771
the US government
would cripple its resources

06:47.806 --> 06:50.007
and employ 100,000 people

06:50.041 --> 06:52.109
just to prove that
we can build pyramids?

06:52.143 --> 06:56.747
OK, so how did they
transport these 50 ton blocks,

06:56.781 --> 06:59.717
without the wheel, hundreds of miles?

07:00.585 --> 07:02.086
I don't know!

07:02.687 --> 07:06.590
Laser beams,
teleportation devices!

07:07.792 --> 07:11.829
First of all, limestone blocks
didn't weigh 50 tons.

07:11.863 --> 07:14.898
It was more like two and a half,

07:14.933 --> 07:17.200
and although they did have
the wheel,

07:17.235 --> 07:20.137
they used something just
as effective called the sledge.

07:20.171 --> 07:23.273
Imagine Santa's sled,
only bigger.

07:23.307 --> 07:25.743
And if you're familiar
with the Nova Experiment

07:25.777 --> 07:28.311
then you would know
that a two and a half ton block

07:28.346 --> 07:31.815
can be easily dragged by
as few as 12 men.

07:31.850 --> 07:34.151
Male student:  A lot of people
disagree with you.

07:35.219 --> 07:36.553
You know that, right?

07:38.456 --> 07:39.990
- A lot of people?
- Uh-huh.

07:41.626 --> 07:44.561
You know, at one time...

07:45.697 --> 07:47.998
a lot of people
thought the Earth was flat.

07:48.833 --> 07:53.103
At one time,
a lot of people thought

07:53.138 --> 07:56.273
that a lot of other people
were witches

07:56.307 --> 07:58.008
and burned them at the stake!

07:58.877 --> 08:03.313
Sometimes,
"a lot of people" just means

08:03.347 --> 08:07.084
a lot of stupidity
and I'm really hoping

08:07.118 --> 08:10.120
this class prevents you
from turning into one of them.

08:10.621 --> 08:13.057
(soft laughter)

08:13.457 --> 08:15.292
(school bell ringing)

08:17.628 --> 08:19.462
Can I carry your books, teacher?

08:19.497 --> 08:20.931
Victor, how are you?

08:20.965 --> 08:24.034
Better... now that you're here!

08:25.403 --> 08:26.770
I've brought you something.

08:27.205 --> 08:28.405
What's this?

08:28.439 --> 08:29.773
Your welcome home present.

08:30.075 --> 08:34.544
Aw Victor, but you
didn't have to do this! Thank you.

08:34.578 --> 08:35.913
Well, I wanted to make sure

08:35.947 --> 08:38.248
you didn't forget
about our date tonight.

08:38.282 --> 08:40.583
Date? Did we have plans?

08:42.620 --> 08:44.221
(laughs)

08:44.255 --> 08:46.924
- Funny!
- Of course I didn't forget!

08:48.292 --> 08:51.461
So, how was your expedition?

08:52.063 --> 08:53.597
Did you bring back something amazing?

08:53.631 --> 08:54.965
Word travels fast, huh?

08:54.999 --> 08:56.566
Yeah, I've heard some things!

08:56.601 --> 08:59.236
Oh, yeah? What sort of things?

08:59.270 --> 09:02.139
Like maybe you came back
with one man extra?

09:03.608 --> 09:05.075
Um, technically,

09:05.110 --> 09:06.977
that's confidential
information at this point.

09:07.011 --> 09:09.146
- So it's true?
- I didn't say that!

09:09.180 --> 09:10.447
Come on!

09:10.481 --> 09:11.548
(sighs)

09:11.582 --> 09:13.316
What time's your next class?

09:13.351 --> 09:15.418
Not for another 40 minutes.

09:16.121 --> 09:18.188
- OK, follow me!
- Yes!

09:26.497 --> 09:28.265
Naihla:  Hey, Isaac!

09:28.299 --> 09:29.332
Isaac:  Good morning!

09:30.368 --> 09:32.669
This is my friend Victor,
he's a professor here.

09:32.703 --> 09:34.371
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

09:34.405 --> 09:37.607
Isaac is an anthropologist who
was a member of our team in Giza.

09:37.642 --> 09:39.143
Ah, very cool.

09:39.644 --> 09:40.778
We were just popping in.

09:41.079 --> 09:42.646
Would you mind if I show
Victor our new guest?

09:42.680 --> 09:44.848
Oh no, no, course! Come on!

09:48.386 --> 09:49.787
Naihla:  Here he is!

09:49.821 --> 09:53.356
(suspenseful music playing)

09:53.391 --> 09:55.058
Victor:  This is incredible!

09:55.093 --> 09:56.994
It's not every day
that you get to stand

09:57.028 --> 09:59.396
before an ancient
Egyptian King, is it?

09:59.430 --> 10:00.597
King?

10:00.965 --> 10:05.669
Userkare, predecessor of Pepi I
from the Sixth Dynasty.

10:05.703 --> 10:08.338
Sixth Dynasty?
Well that would make him,

10:08.372 --> 10:10.674
what, 3,000 years old?

10:10.708 --> 10:13.177
Yeah, give or take!

10:17.982 --> 10:19.649
So, did you hear the news?

10:19.684 --> 10:20.818
What?

10:20.852 --> 10:23.320
Well, supposedly Professor Walton

10:23.354 --> 10:26.556
wants to perform
the autopsy Bi-org.

10:26.590 --> 10:29.827
Bi-org? In England?

10:29.861 --> 10:30.961
So I'm told.

10:31.296 --> 10:32.830
Well what's the point
of shipping the specimen

10:32.864 --> 10:34.198
all the way from Giza
to New York

10:34.232 --> 10:36.166
if it's gonna end up
in Europe?

10:36.201 --> 10:38.001
I don't understand why
we just can't do it here?

10:38.036 --> 10:40.003
Supposedly he
wants to hire a biologist

10:40.038 --> 10:43.473
from Bradford
that absolutely refuses to fly.

10:43.507 --> 10:45.175
(laughing)

10:45.210 --> 10:47.610
I think the professor
just likes travelling abroad

10:47.645 --> 10:48.979
on the university's dime!

10:49.013 --> 10:51.048
Isaac:
Yeah, I think you're right!

10:51.782 --> 10:52.916
Victor:  What happened
to his ears?

10:52.951 --> 10:54.952
This doesn't look like decay.

10:54.986 --> 10:57.087
It looks like somebody
removed them.

10:57.722 --> 11:01.291
Very good. Very observant.

11:03.561 --> 11:05.229
They were removed,

11:06.164 --> 11:10.234
sliced off with a dagger
while he was still alive,

11:10.268 --> 11:11.869
to be precise!

11:12.937 --> 11:15.205
Naihla:  Along with a few
other parts!

11:17.541 --> 11:20.177
Oh, he must have really
pissed somebody off!

11:20.211 --> 11:22.512
(chuckles)
You don't know the half of it!

11:23.281 --> 11:27.951
Userkare for a king,
I'm not familiar with the name.

11:27.986 --> 11:30.720
Naihla:  It would be
really impressive if you were.

11:30.755 --> 11:33.090
So very little
is known about him.

11:34.058 --> 11:35.259
That's what makes this

11:35.293 --> 11:36.459
one of the most significant finds

11:36.494 --> 11:37.794
in the past few centuries!

11:37.996 --> 11:40.497
And according to Naihla,
one of the most dangerous.

11:40.531 --> 11:41.564
Why dangerous?

11:41.599 --> 11:43.133
- Isaac!
- What?

11:43.167 --> 11:44.467
Well...

11:44.502 --> 11:47.771
We uncovered a scroll
and it was Userkare's tomb.

11:48.506 --> 11:51.808
It was in an ancient text
that we haven't seen before.

11:51.842 --> 11:54.177
Naihla was able
to translate the inscription.

11:56.747 --> 11:58.481
According to the scroll,

11:58.516 --> 12:03.053
Userkare's soul was
still trapped inside his body,

12:03.087 --> 12:05.389
cursed for all eternity.

12:06.190 --> 12:09.192
Any who dared try to release it

12:09.227 --> 12:12.829
are doomed to
an agonizing death!

12:12.863 --> 12:14.298
Right.
Isn't that right, Naihla?

12:14.899 --> 12:16.699
Yeah, something like that!

12:17.368 --> 12:20.003
Oh, so how do you release the soul?

12:20.038 --> 12:23.307
Well, conveniently that
part of the scroll is missing!

12:24.809 --> 12:25.842
Of course!

12:26.110 --> 12:29.046
Don't get too close!
It's not safe!

12:29.080 --> 12:34.151
Userkare won't bite!
(laughs) I promise you!

12:34.185 --> 12:36.119
Professor,
good to see you again.

12:36.154 --> 12:36.954
Victor.

12:36.988 --> 12:38.055
Naihla:  I'm so sorry, Professor.

12:38.489 --> 12:40.657
I know we're not permitted
to bring anyone up here.

12:40.691 --> 12:41.724
It's all right, Naihla,

12:42.193 --> 12:45.228
we'll make an exception
for the young doctor here.

12:45.263 --> 12:51.601
After all, who better to aid us in
the study of ancient anatomy!

12:52.203 --> 12:54.204
I'm afraid
I won't do you any good.

12:54.238 --> 12:56.606
I only deal with the living!

12:56.640 --> 12:58.008
Walton:
That's unfortunate!

12:58.042 --> 13:00.944
There's an ocean of knowledge
to be discovered

13:00.979 --> 13:03.180
within the remains of Userkare.

13:04.949 --> 13:06.683
And the curse?

13:06.717 --> 13:08.151
Stories, Victor,

13:08.186 --> 13:10.387
a fear tactic used in order

13:10.421 --> 13:15.392
to prevent others
from tampering with the remains,

13:15.426 --> 13:16.593
that's all there is.

13:17.128 --> 13:18.595
I can assure you, my dear,

13:18.863 --> 13:25.035
that Userkare's soul has long since
retired from this body.

13:27.605 --> 13:30.340
Oh, gee, I hope I didn't
get you into any trouble.

13:30.375 --> 13:31.608
No, not at all!

13:31.642 --> 13:33.977
Professor Walton is
actually very fond of you.

13:34.012 --> 13:35.812
He talks a lot about you.

13:35.846 --> 13:37.381
Oh, really? What does he say?

13:38.282 --> 13:40.717
That you're a whizz kid and
smarter than most of the people

13:40.751 --> 13:43.420
that he's ever come across in
the field of medicine.

13:43.454 --> 13:44.554
That's very kind of him.

13:44.588 --> 13:46.523
Not true, but very kind!

13:46.557 --> 13:49.559
Look, Professor Walton does not
mince words and he rarely

13:49.593 --> 13:51.194
ever brags about anyone.

13:51.229 --> 13:53.463
Personally, I disagree with him.

13:54.598 --> 13:56.066
Is that right?

13:56.300 --> 13:59.002
Yeah, I don't think you're
as smart as people say you are.

13:59.037 --> 14:00.670
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:00.704 --> 14:02.572
Why's that?

14:02.606 --> 14:04.941
Well if you were smart then

14:04.975 --> 14:06.576
you'd have asked me
out a lot sooner!

14:06.877 --> 14:08.278
(both laughing)

14:11.115 --> 14:14.651
Hey, better late than never!

14:14.685 --> 14:16.219
I'll see you tonight.

14:16.254 --> 14:18.588
Don't forget to text me
your address.

14:18.622 --> 14:19.656
I won't!

14:23.094 --> 14:24.528
(eerie music playing)

14:24.562 --> 14:26.029
Good morning.

14:26.064 --> 14:27.464
Morning, Professor.

14:46.984 --> 14:50.187
(cars speeding by)

14:57.161 --> 14:58.595
Carter:  How's it going, pal?

15:02.266 --> 15:03.600
You got any extra?

15:06.804 --> 15:08.405
Pull up a seat, friend.

15:16.614 --> 15:17.714
Thank you.

15:22.853 --> 15:23.820
(spits)

15:23.854 --> 15:25.422
(chuckles)

15:26.424 --> 15:28.391
Man, how you eat this shit?

15:28.426 --> 15:31.761
Oh, you get used to it!
I've eaten way worse!

15:32.463 --> 15:34.063
Well, I'm sorry about that.

15:34.098 --> 15:37.167
Well, this always helps.

15:44.742 --> 15:46.309
It's freezing out here.

15:46.344 --> 15:48.211
Is this where you sleep?

15:48.246 --> 15:50.046
Right where you're sitting.

15:51.349 --> 15:53.750
Isn't there a shelter
around here?

15:53.784 --> 15:55.318
Some place warm?

15:55.353 --> 15:58.488
Shelter?
I'd rather be in prison!

16:00.424 --> 16:01.758
I've seen some things happen

16:01.792 --> 16:04.093
in those places
you wouldn't believe!

16:04.962 --> 16:06.663
I believe anything.

16:06.697 --> 16:08.331
You know you're
not allowed to bring

16:08.366 --> 16:10.433
personal belongings
to those places, right?

16:10.468 --> 16:14.103
They're afraid you're gonna
smuggle in drugs or lice.

16:14.639 --> 16:18.708
I had an orderly once throw out
my bag while I was asleep.

16:18.742 --> 16:20.109
Scumbags!

16:21.779 --> 16:25.549
You see this blanket?
It was my daughter's.

16:26.217 --> 16:30.387
I'd rather be out here in
the cold than to give this up.

16:31.455 --> 16:36.125
Where's your daughter now?
Can't she help you out?

16:38.062 --> 16:41.431
I don't wanna talk about that.

16:41.465 --> 16:42.365
Oh...

16:42.567 --> 16:45.868
I understand.
It's a tough world,

16:45.903 --> 16:47.637
no doubt about it.

16:48.239 --> 16:49.706
I'll tell you what, pal.

16:49.740 --> 16:52.008
Since you've been so
generous to me,

16:52.042 --> 16:53.743
I'll be straight with you.

16:55.045 --> 16:57.080
I'm not really in dire straits.

16:59.317 --> 17:03.453
No. I make a decent living
over at the university.

17:05.289 --> 17:08.156
- Come on!
- I'm serious!

17:10.228 --> 17:13.463
I thought you looked too clean.
(chuckles)

17:13.497 --> 17:16.499
See, I'm telling you the truth,

17:17.367 --> 17:22.171
and because I'm such a nice guy
I'm gonna help you out.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.708
Oh, bless you, friend.

17:25.776 --> 17:28.211
I knew you were a good man
when I saw you--

17:28.246 --> 17:29.746
(screams)

17:29.780 --> 17:31.848
(shushing)

17:33.851 --> 17:35.218
Easy now.

17:35.853 --> 17:38.121
(muffled moaning)

17:38.155 --> 17:41.824
Easy. It's for the best.

17:41.859 --> 17:43.627
Just think of your daughter.

17:45.396 --> 17:49.165
That's it, that's it.

17:50.901 --> 17:52.201
That's it.

17:56.039 --> 18:01.611
(suspenseful music playing)

18:06.850 --> 18:08.652
(slicing)

18:13.123 --> 18:15.191
So, tell me more about your work.

18:15.225 --> 18:16.926
Clearly you love what you do.

18:17.828 --> 18:20.797
I do, that's the reason
why I wake up in the morning.

18:20.831 --> 18:23.800
What is it about archaeology
that excites you?

18:24.735 --> 18:26.169
Lots of things.

18:26.837 --> 18:29.539
It's amazing to see where
we came from,

18:29.573 --> 18:31.908
how far we've progressed
or how little,

18:33.644 --> 18:35.312
to uncover our
notion of knowledge

18:35.346 --> 18:37.414
buried by the sands of time.

18:38.215 --> 18:40.383
What's greater than discovery?

18:41.352 --> 18:43.186
Can I ask you something?

18:43.220 --> 18:44.187
Sure!

18:44.221 --> 18:46.823
Userkare, the curse...

18:47.358 --> 18:49.192
Do you really believe
in all that stuff?

18:49.893 --> 18:52.629
If I said yes would that be
a deal breaker for us?

18:52.663 --> 18:55.532
No, not at all!
I'm just interested.

18:57.301 --> 18:59.001
Don't patronize me.

18:59.036 --> 19:00.770
I know you think it's ridiculous!

19:00.805 --> 19:02.004
Whoa. I didn't say that.

19:02.039 --> 19:05.007
You didn't have to,
I know your type!

19:05.042 --> 19:06.343
My type?

19:06.377 --> 19:08.445
Yes, your type!

19:08.479 --> 19:10.880
You believe in science so
that probably means

19:10.914 --> 19:12.716
that you're an atheist,

19:12.750 --> 19:15.852
but judging by
your arrogant reputation,

19:15.886 --> 19:20.289
my guess is that
you're most likely a Satanist!

19:21.459 --> 19:23.860
A Satanist?  Really!

19:23.894 --> 19:25.528
Yes, a Satanist.

19:25.563 --> 19:28.130
You believe that men are
their own gods.

19:28.165 --> 19:29.432
What's wrong with that?

19:30.934 --> 19:32.235
Nothing.

19:33.036 --> 19:35.338
I just think it's sad if
you believe we're on this earth

19:35.373 --> 19:37.106
for such short amount of time
just to end up

19:37.140 --> 19:39.342
in a wooden box
covered in maggots.

19:39.943 --> 19:41.277
Fair enough.

19:43.347 --> 19:44.981
So what about you, Victor?

19:45.015 --> 19:47.784
When did you first realize
that you wanted to get into medicine?

19:48.318 --> 19:50.420
Um, at a very young age.

19:52.089 --> 19:55.925
And, did something profound occur
that inspired you?

19:57.762 --> 19:59.529
I just wanted to help people.

20:02.132 --> 20:03.833
I suppose that's a good answer!

20:12.676 --> 20:18.515
(suspenseful music plays)

21:25.048 --> 21:26.683
(slicing)

21:28.652 --> 21:31.955
- (gas hissing)
- (coughing)

21:35.192 --> 21:36.960
(Walton coughing)

21:41.599 --> 21:43.466
(coughing, wheezing)

21:52.142 --> 21:55.344
Hey, listen,
I hope I didn't offend you

21:55.379 --> 21:56.646
with the whole curse thing.

21:57.180 --> 21:58.515
No, not at all.

22:00.784 --> 22:04.888
You know, my grandfather
was an anthropologist in Cairo.

22:06.023 --> 22:08.925
He led many expeditions
for over 50 years.

22:10.728 --> 22:13.696
In 1932, he was part of a team

22:13.731 --> 22:15.999
who discovered a tomb in Abusir.

22:17.601 --> 22:20.003
There were many,
many great treasures.

22:21.071 --> 22:23.039
Needless to say,
many of the men thought

22:23.073 --> 22:25.842
it would be a good idea to take
some home for themselves,

22:26.944 --> 22:29.979
all but my grandfather
who knew that it was cursed.

22:31.549 --> 22:33.115
He begged and pleaded with the men

22:33.150 --> 22:37.053
to leave the treasures
behind, but no one listened.

22:37.588 --> 22:40.723
And within a year,
every single person

22:40.758 --> 22:42.258
on that team was dead.

22:42.893 --> 22:46.395
Except your grandfather? Wow!

22:50.267 --> 22:54.037
There are powers on this earth
greater than anyone can imagine.

22:55.238 --> 22:57.006
My grandfather believed this...

22:58.609 --> 22:59.842
...and so do I.

23:13.857 --> 23:16.859
(coughing)

23:38.281 --> 23:41.484
(hissing)

23:46.023 --> 23:47.624
(air whooshing)

23:52.997 --> 23:57.500
(eerie hissing)
(faint screeching)

23:57.534 --> 24:00.703
(scraping)
(air whooshing)

24:03.140 --> 24:06.943
(high-pitched hissing)

24:12.315 --> 24:13.382
(door slamming)

24:13.717 --> 24:15.584
It's gotten even colder,
if you can believe that.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.755
I've got you a sandwich
if you're hungry, Professor.

24:18.989 --> 24:21.190
You haven't eaten since this morning.

24:26.096 --> 24:27.263
Professor?

24:28.932 --> 24:30.133
Professor!

24:30.668 --> 24:33.269
- Do you want me to get help?
- I'm all right.

24:33.937 --> 24:35.571
Well, you don't look all right.

24:37.941 --> 24:40.810
What's--
What happened in here?

24:41.745 --> 24:43.946
(eerie music playing)

24:43.981 --> 24:45.081
What's that?

24:53.724 --> 24:59.361
It's the eye! Jesus!
Where did you find this?

24:59.396 --> 25:03.066
It was embedded in his ribcage.

25:05.135 --> 25:06.069
(stifled laugh)

25:06.103 --> 25:08.738
This guy,
he's full of surprises!

25:12.209 --> 25:13.710
It's incredible!

25:17.981 --> 25:22.351
Oh, this is easily the oldest
symbol of the Eider day.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.755
The boys are gonna go ape-shit
when they see this!

25:26.556 --> 25:30.492
You know, technically we don't have
to tell anybody about this.

25:31.195 --> 25:34.697
You could call up that
rare antiquities dealer in Dubai.

25:35.398 --> 25:37.566
It would be our little secret.

25:40.771 --> 25:43.372
Oh, come on, Professor!
I'm just joking!

25:43.406 --> 25:44.373
(slicing)

25:44.407 --> 25:48.711
(gasping, choking)

25:51.381 --> 25:53.649
(ripping)

25:57.520 --> 26:00.723
(suspenseful music playing)

26:13.270 --> 26:16.172
(squelching)

26:17.540 --> 26:19.708
(heart beating)

26:28.385 --> 26:32.354
I had a really great time tonight
and so did my belly!

26:32.389 --> 26:33.790
(chuckles)

26:33.824 --> 26:35.324
Good, I'm glad!

26:43.500 --> 26:45.201
Can I tell you something?

26:46.103 --> 26:47.336
Of course!

26:49.339 --> 26:52.308
I've never told anybody
what I'm about to tell you.

26:53.510 --> 26:56.445
I guess I've never felt
this close to anyone.

26:56.479 --> 26:57.880
OK...

26:59.850 --> 27:02.084
I did get into
medicine for a reason.

27:06.389 --> 27:09.091
My mom killed herself when
I was just a boy.

27:10.727 --> 27:14.263
I found her in her bathtub.
She had slit both her wrists.

27:14.898 --> 27:17.233
(soft music playing)

27:17.267 --> 27:19.735
I stayed with her for days,
you know.

27:22.172 --> 27:24.106
She was like a block of ice.

27:28.045 --> 27:29.712
It wasn't until around
three days later

27:29.746 --> 27:31.347
that the cops showed up.

27:33.083 --> 27:34.917
They had to pull me
away from her.

27:34.952 --> 27:39.155
I remember they had to pry
our fingers apart.

27:43.693 --> 27:46.062
Victor, I'm so sorry.

27:46.096 --> 27:47.596
It shouldn't have to be that way,

27:47.630 --> 27:49.065
it doesn't have to.

27:52.402 --> 27:54.937
Victor, look at me.

27:54.972 --> 27:56.705
I'm so sorry.

27:58.976 --> 28:00.809
You know what I wish?

28:02.379 --> 28:05.748
I wish that I'm wrong
about everything...

28:08.352 --> 28:10.853
...and I hope then when I die
I'll get to see her again...

28:12.756 --> 28:14.023
...just to see her smile.

28:14.057 --> 28:17.260
(siren blares in background)

28:35.745 --> 28:38.948
(music playing)

29:32.486 --> 29:35.354
(bells ringing)

29:37.690 --> 29:39.792
(eerie music playing)

29:39.826 --> 29:42.027
Isaac! Professor Walton?

29:49.970 --> 29:53.172
(water dripping)

30:00.413 --> 30:03.282
(heart beating)

30:29.075 --> 30:30.910
Professor Khalil!

30:30.944 --> 30:33.145
God, Professor.  You scared me!

30:33.613 --> 30:35.447
Skittish as a kitten.

30:36.116 --> 30:38.017
Who's been tampering
with the remains?

30:38.051 --> 30:39.185
What do you mean?

30:39.419 --> 30:40.920
Well, here,
look at the chest cavity.

30:40.954 --> 30:42.554
Something was removed.

30:42.588 --> 30:44.656
Oh, yes, that is odd.

30:44.691 --> 30:46.292
Was Isaac down here last night?

30:46.326 --> 30:50.963
Possibly. The last I saw
of him was yesterday afternoon.

30:50.997 --> 30:52.364
I'm sure he would have called me

30:52.398 --> 30:54.834
if he'd found
anything of significance.

30:54.868 --> 30:57.136
Well that's what concerns me.

30:57.170 --> 30:58.537
Isaac wouldn't have done this

30:58.571 --> 31:00.605
and he's not even
authorized to do so.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.074
(high-pitched hissing)

31:02.108 --> 31:04.910
Professor!
Professor, are you all right?

31:04.945 --> 31:06.345
Yes, I'm fine.

31:06.379 --> 31:09.315
Lately I've been
having these horrible migraines.

31:09.349 --> 31:11.516
Well maybe you should
go home and get some rest.

31:11.551 --> 31:14.486
No, I've got a lecture to give
this afternoon.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.420
I'll be all right.

31:15.655 --> 31:18.824
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes. Quite sure.

31:18.859 --> 31:20.192
OK.

32:00.133 --> 32:01.466
(straining)

32:06.172 --> 32:07.472
Victor:  Need some help?

32:09.175 --> 32:11.777
Victor, what are you doing here?

32:11.811 --> 32:13.012
Spying on you!

32:13.046 --> 32:14.113
I can see that!

32:14.147 --> 32:15.614
What have we got here?

32:16.383 --> 32:18.884
"Ancient Egyptian Spells
and Mysticism".

32:18.919 --> 32:20.119
Don't even...

32:20.153 --> 32:21.620
I didn't say anything!

32:23.290 --> 32:26.058
This book looks like
it's about 300 years old.

32:26.893 --> 32:29.161
Why did you leave this morning?

32:29.195 --> 32:30.729
You're mad at me?

32:33.166 --> 32:34.733
You could have said goodbye.

32:36.702 --> 32:39.604
You just looked so peaceful
I didn't wanna wake you.

32:40.740 --> 32:42.207
I'm here now, right?

32:46.413 --> 32:48.880
I suppose it's better
you didn't startle me anyway.

32:49.615 --> 32:51.516
I'm not used to having
a man in my bed

32:51.551 --> 32:54.653
and I keep a very large knife hidden
underneath my mattress!

32:54.687 --> 32:57.156
Good to know
for future reference!

32:57.190 --> 32:59.425
Future reference?
What makes you think

32:59.459 --> 33:01.760
you'll ever be back
in my bed again?

33:01.794 --> 33:03.429
I can think of a few reasons!

33:03.930 --> 33:05.431
Victor...

33:06.333 --> 33:08.400
So when can I see you again?
Tonight?

33:10.270 --> 33:12.137
- Tonight?
- What time?

33:12.172 --> 33:13.638
Eight o'clock.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.008
OK.

33:24.451 --> 33:29.321
It was during this
borrowed time with Osiris,

33:29.856 --> 33:33.392
that Isis conceived a child,

33:34.594 --> 33:35.627
Horus.

33:35.661 --> 33:38.030
(high-pitched hissing)

33:38.064 --> 33:40.665
(muffled hissing)

33:42.735 --> 33:46.905
Longing to
avenge his father's death,

33:47.540 --> 33:52.211
Horus challenged Set to
a series of contests

33:52.245 --> 33:54.613
which lasted nearly 80 years.

33:54.647 --> 33:58.484
After endless battles
of strength and wit,

33:58.518 --> 34:02.888
the gods
declared Horus the victor

34:02.922 --> 34:08.494
and the rightful heir to
the throne of Egypt.

34:09.695 --> 34:13.264
(high pitched hissing)

34:13.299 --> 34:14.666
Walton:  I'm sorry.

34:16.101 --> 34:17.969
You'll have to excuse me.

34:18.538 --> 34:20.705
And that's
all there is for today.

34:24.310 --> 34:27.413
(students muttering)

34:40.159 --> 34:41.360
Lenora:  Feel better, Professor.

34:41.393 --> 34:45.164
Yes, thank you.
Lenora, isn't it?

34:45.197 --> 34:46.297
Yes.

34:46.732 --> 34:49.935
Professor Desai told me
you were her brightest student.

34:50.370 --> 34:51.770
She also told me

34:51.804 --> 34:56.208
that your dissertation was
exceptionally good.

34:56.976 --> 34:58.544
I don't know about that!

34:58.578 --> 34:59.711
Don't be modest!

34:59.745 --> 35:03.449
You're a beautiful,
intelligent young woman.

35:04.117 --> 35:07.852
I'd like to talk to you
about an internship position.

35:07.887 --> 35:13.125
It could be extremely
advantageous to your career.

35:13.159 --> 35:15.527
Why don't you stop by
in my laboratory

35:15.562 --> 35:19.164
later this evening so
we can discuss it?

35:19.199 --> 35:21.233
I don't know what to say,
thank you.

35:21.267 --> 35:25.437
It's my pleasure.
Ten o'clock all right?

35:25.472 --> 35:27.172
Ten o'clock is perfect.

35:27.207 --> 35:29.341
- See you tonight.
- Bye, Professor.

35:31.544 --> 35:34.079
Victor:
<i>Tuesday, February 2nd, 2014,</i>

35:34.347 --> 35:37.516
Time is 7:26 pm.

35:37.550 --> 35:39.518
Subject has retained
animation for one month,

35:39.552 --> 35:44.189
one hour and 18 minutes
and 18 seconds to be exact.

35:44.857 --> 35:46.758
Appendage has shown considerable signs

35:46.792 --> 35:48.693
of rejuvenation despite independence

35:48.728 --> 35:51.263
of blood vessels in major arteries.

35:52.098 --> 35:54.833
Base color of the specimen
is now an off-yellow as opposed

35:54.867 --> 35:57.936
to the heavy bruising that
was evident only a few days ago.

36:02.008 --> 36:05.210
(glass clinking)

36:05.245 --> 36:08.547
Sensitivity in specimen is
becoming more acute.

36:09.849 --> 36:12.851
(sound of flesh cutting)

36:14.687 --> 36:20.592
Current reflex to pinpricks
suggest discomfort or even pain.

36:24.063 --> 36:25.697
It's warm.

36:28.034 --> 36:29.367
The serum works.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.074
The data is conclusive.

36:36.876 --> 36:40.645
Full body reanimation is a go upon
final delivery of specimen.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.156
(faint clattering)

36:51.191 --> 36:52.224
Who's there?

36:52.258 --> 36:53.625
(creaking)

36:56.429 --> 36:57.796
Jesus, Carter!

36:57.997 --> 37:01.433
Carter:  I've got to hand it to
you Doc, for a lab rat,

37:02.235 --> 37:04.002
you have excellent taste in women!

37:06.306 --> 37:07.706
Professor Khalil.

37:09.709 --> 37:12.610
Tell me, Doctor, how she smell?

37:13.379 --> 37:14.713
You gotten those panties yet?

37:14.747 --> 37:16.381
Did you bring what I asked for?

37:16.415 --> 37:18.416
- Got it right here.
- Let me see it!

37:23.990 --> 37:25.523
That's perfect.

37:25.558 --> 37:29.061
Oh it's fresh, Doc, real fresh.

37:29.095 --> 37:30.162
So fresh there's probably some

37:30.429 --> 37:31.897
marbles still
roll around in there!

37:33.299 --> 37:34.967
That's the idea.
Good work, man.

37:35.001 --> 37:36.301
Yep.

37:37.770 --> 37:38.937
Business first.

37:46.946 --> 37:48.413
Oh and Doc...

37:50.116 --> 37:52.784
There's one mighty issue
we need to discuss.

37:52.818 --> 37:54.219
What's up?

37:54.254 --> 37:59.424
Well, since this item was
a little harder to come by,

37:59.458 --> 38:01.293
five grand
just ain't gonna cut it.

38:01.327 --> 38:02.594
What are you talking about?

38:02.628 --> 38:04.329
We said five grand for delivery.

38:06.266 --> 38:09.935
- What are you doing?
- Renegotiating our agreement.

38:12.638 --> 38:14.606
I know it stings, Doc...

38:17.143 --> 38:18.843
...but it is what it is.

38:21.414 --> 38:23.949
Jesus Christ, what are
you doing down here?

38:24.850 --> 38:27.920
I mean the limbs are one thing
but you've got enough chemicals

38:27.954 --> 38:31.023
down here to...
wipe out a small country!

38:40.967 --> 38:42.767
Don't do that!

38:46.072 --> 38:47.705
Take it easy, Doc.

38:47.740 --> 38:52.444
Listen, moron, a lot of this stuff
is highly combustible.

38:54.113 --> 38:57.916
We wouldn't want
anything nasty to happen to you.

38:57.951 --> 38:59.851
You're alright, Doc.

38:59.885 --> 39:02.554
Nice to see you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

39:02.588 --> 39:04.356
Just tell me what you want.

39:05.891 --> 39:08.660
I want 30 grand
in exchange for the brain.

39:09.495 --> 39:11.096
Don't say you ain't got it.

39:11.697 --> 39:12.998
I've seen that silver
spoon sticking

39:13.199 --> 39:14.732
out of your ass the minute
I laid eyes on you.

39:14.767 --> 39:16.768
You want me
to pay you 30 grand

39:16.802 --> 39:19.471
for something I can lift
from the University morgue?

39:19.505 --> 39:21.806
Thirty grand just ain't
for supplies.

39:21.841 --> 39:24.076
For me keeping my mouth shut.

39:24.110 --> 39:27.145
And if you say no,
I'll blow the lid off

39:27.180 --> 39:29.014
this demented little
science experiment here.

39:29.048 --> 39:31.283
You think I won't
bring you down with me?

39:31.317 --> 39:32.550
You can try!

39:33.453 --> 39:36.154
But I don't think you want
to be accessory to murder.

39:36.189 --> 39:38.490
(suspenseful music playing)

39:38.524 --> 39:40.025
What are you talking about?

39:41.127 --> 39:43.395
You said you wanted fresh!

39:44.397 --> 39:45.763
Jesus!

39:46.299 --> 39:47.866
That's right, Doc,

39:48.934 --> 39:53.105
so if I were you,
I'd quit making threats.

39:57.210 --> 39:58.310
You're insane!

39:58.344 --> 40:00.445
(laughing)

40:00.480 --> 40:03.081
I'm insane?
You know one of these days

40:03.116 --> 40:05.984
you need to look at yourself
in the mirror, Doc!

40:08.021 --> 40:11.023
(squelching)

40:13.059 --> 40:14.592
What the hell is that?

40:23.602 --> 40:25.103
(dramatic music playing)

40:25.138 --> 40:26.604
What the fuck?

40:27.040 --> 40:28.740
(screams)

40:33.346 --> 40:35.613
(clattering)

40:36.082 --> 40:38.250
(grunts)

40:38.284 --> 40:39.717
Victor:  Fuck!

40:40.553 --> 40:44.889
(screaming)

40:54.200 --> 40:55.333
(screams)

40:55.368 --> 40:56.734
(knife slicing)

40:59.238 --> 41:02.207
(Victor breathing heavily)

41:05.178 --> 41:07.579
(strained grunting)

41:13.486 --> 41:16.688
(breathing heavily)

41:21.660 --> 41:24.862
(suspenseful music playing)

41:36.175 --> 41:37.875
You, greedy mother fuck!

41:43.483 --> 41:47.285
(sobs)

41:47.320 --> 41:48.953
It was perfect!

41:49.655 --> 41:54.392
(sobs)

41:54.427 --> 41:55.693
Fuck!

42:03.269 --> 42:07.972
(suspenseful music plays)

42:22.421 --> 42:24.222
(strained grunting)

42:35.834 --> 42:37.902
(action music plays)

43:24.750 --> 43:29.187
(electric saw whirs)

44:21.774 --> 44:24.976
(alarm blaring)

44:35.554 --> 44:39.557
- Live!
- (discharge sound)

44:39.592 --> 44:41.125
- Yes!
- (electronic fizzling)

44:41.727 --> 44:43.027
Yes. Come on, live.

44:45.864 --> 44:49.634
- Come on!
- (fizzling continues)

44:49.669 --> 44:54.071
Come on! Come on, live!

44:54.106 --> 44:56.474
- Come on, you son of a bitch!
- (rapid beeping)

45:03.849 --> 45:09.387
No, no, come on, live, live!

45:09.422 --> 45:10.988
Come on!

45:12.958 --> 45:17.261
(explosions)

45:17.697 --> 45:19.364
(alarm blaring)

45:24.603 --> 45:27.806
(powering down)

45:38.351 --> 45:39.951
No...

45:40.953 --> 45:43.421
No, no, don't do this to me!

45:43.456 --> 45:44.789
Come on!

45:50.429 --> 45:52.430
Come on! Come on!

45:54.867 --> 45:57.802
Fuck! Fuck!

45:57.837 --> 45:59.871
Come on! Come on!

45:59.905 --> 46:04.008
Come on! Come on! Come on!

46:04.510 --> 46:05.877
Come on!

46:18.424 --> 46:20.258
Come on!

46:20.292 --> 46:23.728
(whimpering)

46:23.763 --> 46:26.998
(rapid beeping)

46:28.667 --> 46:30.034
(groans)

46:34.607 --> 46:37.141
(vomits)

47:09.875 --> 47:11.242
Asshole!

47:16.482 --> 47:18.249
Professor Walton?

47:20.886 --> 47:22.219
Hello, Professor?

47:45.811 --> 47:47.912
Walton:
Extraordinary, isn't it?

47:47.947 --> 47:49.213
Oh, Professor!

47:51.584 --> 47:56.220
I'm sorry,
I have the tendency to do that.

47:56.755 --> 47:58.122
It's OK.

47:59.925 --> 48:03.260
Well... what do you think?

48:03.929 --> 48:06.297
It's amazing, so well-preserved.

48:06.732 --> 48:13.872
You'd be amazed at how well
preserved he actually is.

48:13.906 --> 48:16.641
Would you like to touch him?

48:16.675 --> 48:17.842
What?

48:17.877 --> 48:19.677
Go ahead!

48:19.712 --> 48:21.045
No, I shouldn't!

48:21.079 --> 48:24.348
Oh, come on.
He won't harm you.

48:28.621 --> 48:32.657
Walton:  Doesn't it feel just
like worn leather?

48:33.091 --> 48:35.359
Hard to believe this was

48:35.394 --> 48:40.431
once warm yielding flesh,

48:41.867 --> 48:45.937
just as alive as you and I are

48:45.971 --> 48:48.673
at this very moment.

48:51.510 --> 48:55.146
So, um, did you want to discuss
that internship with me?

48:56.015 --> 49:01.953
I'm selecting three students to
assist me in Userkare's autopsy

49:01.987 --> 49:04.422
at Bio Ark in York.

49:04.456 --> 49:09.260
I want you to be a member
of my team, Lenora.

49:09.294 --> 49:12.496
I'm flattered. Yes, I accept.

49:12.531 --> 49:17.101
I could see the passion
in your eyes this afternoon

49:17.135 --> 49:20.038
when you were listening
to my lecture.

49:21.607 --> 49:23.741
Did you enjoy it?

49:23.776 --> 49:24.842
Yes, you tell it so well

49:25.143 --> 49:27.211
it's almost as if
you were actually there.

49:27.245 --> 49:31.783
Sometimes I feel as if I were.

49:32.618 --> 49:35.319
You know there
are many similarities

49:35.353 --> 49:38.623
between Osiris and Userkare.

49:38.657 --> 49:40.858
Really? Like what?

49:40.893 --> 49:46.731
Well, for instance,
like Osiris's brother, Set,

49:46.765 --> 49:50.134
Userkare was also an usurper.

49:50.168 --> 49:53.037
He murdered
his own father, Teti,

49:53.072 --> 49:56.373
and succeeded
his older brother, Pepi,

49:56.408 --> 49:58.743
the rightful heir to the throne.

49:58.777 --> 50:01.278
But Pepi eventually
became king, didn't he?

50:01.313 --> 50:03.047
So what happened to Userkare?

50:03.082 --> 50:06.383
Userkare was a tyrant,
a monster.

50:06.418 --> 50:09.487
It wasn't long before those
closest to him

50:09.521 --> 50:16.327
conspired with Pepi to put
an end to his reign of terror.

50:16.361 --> 50:21.933
He was betrayed by his
own guard and put to death,

50:21.967 --> 50:26.137
but not before his sensory organs

50:26.171 --> 50:30.108
were removed, one by one.

50:30.142 --> 50:34.512
First his tongue, then his nose,

50:34.546 --> 50:36.180
next his ears.

50:36.214 --> 50:39.283
His eyes were allowed to remain

50:39.317 --> 50:41.986
so that he would be able to watch

50:42.021 --> 50:45.356
as his phallus was sawn off

50:45.390 --> 50:48.526
and thrown to the dogs.

50:51.096 --> 50:55.399
The infamous brain removal tool--

50:55.433 --> 50:59.236
he was still alive
when the priests

50:59.271 --> 51:01.906
began to embalm him.

51:01.940 --> 51:03.240
Oh, my God!

51:03.275 --> 51:06.377
Legend has it
that Pepi summoned

51:06.411 --> 51:10.314
a powerful sorceress to cast

51:10.348 --> 51:13.551
a spell upon Userkare's soul.

51:13.585 --> 51:16.520
A spell that would prevent Userkare

51:16.555 --> 51:20.725
from ever entering the joyous gates

51:20.759 --> 51:25.897
of the afterlife
and all the glories that it--

51:25.931 --> 51:28.032
(screams)

51:28.067 --> 51:31.268
(growling)

51:34.206 --> 51:37.308
(Lenora screaming)

51:38.443 --> 51:42.113
Professor,
please let me go, please!

51:55.293 --> 51:57.195
(screams)

51:58.030 --> 51:59.864
(splattering, squelching)

51:59.898 --> 52:03.201
(heart beating)

52:08.440 --> 52:11.642
(suspenseful music playing)

52:23.021 --> 52:24.889
(grunting)

52:31.797 --> 52:33.264
(growls)

52:46.945 --> 52:49.647
Please, don't kill me!

52:50.849 --> 52:52.817
Oh, God, don't!

52:59.258 --> 53:01.259
Professor Khalil.

53:02.594 --> 53:04.796
(speaking in foreign language)

53:10.068 --> 53:11.335
Naihla,

53:11.369 --> 53:14.738
I shall bring her to you,
great king.

53:15.573 --> 53:16.640
(roars)

53:19.044 --> 53:22.246
(suspenseful music playing)

53:36.094 --> 53:37.528
(metallic clattering)

53:47.739 --> 53:50.708
(grunting)

55:13.225 --> 55:15.859
(footsteps)

55:34.846 --> 55:36.780
(growls)

55:47.392 --> 55:50.594
(struggling)

55:54.499 --> 55:56.434
(screams)
Oh, fuck!

56:05.277 --> 56:07.445
(heavy breathing)

56:11.116 --> 56:13.017
(coughs)

56:16.088 --> 56:17.421
I did it!

56:19.224 --> 56:20.657
It's alive.

56:22.461 --> 56:24.962
It's alive!

56:32.704 --> 56:35.373
She didn't mention to you
where she was going?

56:35.407 --> 56:36.740
Anything wrong?

56:39.611 --> 56:41.112
Naihla:  Professor?

56:42.447 --> 56:43.481
What's going on here?

56:43.515 --> 56:44.715
Can I... help you, miss?

56:44.749 --> 56:46.250
Oh, it's alright.
She works here.

56:46.284 --> 56:47.451
It's Professor Khalil.

56:48.186 --> 56:50.488
Oh, do you mind if
I ask you to step outside?

56:50.522 --> 56:53.257
I'd like to have a few words with you
once I'm done here?

56:54.026 --> 56:56.960
- Sure.
- Thank you. Just be a second.

56:58.930 --> 57:01.932
(hushed talking)

57:38.303 --> 57:41.205
Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy!

57:41.239 --> 57:42.773
(growls)

57:42.807 --> 57:44.241
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

57:44.276 --> 57:47.478
(grunting)

57:52.850 --> 57:54.885
The subject is aggressive.

57:54.919 --> 57:57.854
He's only displaying primitive
and animalistic behavior.

58:01.226 --> 58:03.561
- I guess the transplant...
<i>- Water!</i>

58:06.498 --> 58:07.965
What did you say?

58:09.601 --> 58:12.570
(grunting)

58:12.604 --> 58:15.306
(attempts to speak)

58:15.340 --> 58:17.541
- Water!
- You can speak.

58:20.512 --> 58:22.546
- Water!
- Water.

58:23.582 --> 58:25.149
Of course! Um...

58:31.456 --> 58:33.257
Here you go.

58:33.291 --> 58:35.025
- (grunting)
- Mmm!

58:36.995 --> 58:39.296
It's good, huh? Refreshing?

58:43.502 --> 58:44.868
Victor:  Subject spoke.

58:44.902 --> 58:46.870
He asked for water.

58:46.904 --> 58:49.706
There's no telling what
he's capable of at this point.

58:51.709 --> 58:56.079
What about... words?
Hmm?

58:56.981 --> 58:59.283
Reading?
Can you read this word?

59:09.093 --> 59:12.329
What does that word say?
Come on!

59:13.965 --> 59:15.065
Ca--

59:17.835 --> 59:20.337
Come on, I put those
vocal chords in there myself.

59:20.372 --> 59:21.672
I know they work.

59:23.975 --> 59:26.343
- Cat!
- Cat, yes!

59:26.911 --> 59:29.313
That's very, very good!

59:29.347 --> 59:32.349
Very good! And this word?

59:32.984 --> 59:34.718
How about that word?

59:39.524 --> 59:42.493
Psy... Psy...

59:42.527 --> 59:44.728
Psychology!

59:46.030 --> 59:47.964
You can read on your own?

59:48.567 --> 59:49.933
That's incredible!

59:51.336 --> 59:53.036
What about the book next to it?

01:00:11.155 --> 01:00:16.660
- Chloroform.
- Chloroform, yes... Hey!

01:00:17.262 --> 01:00:18.329
Easy!

01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:23.334
You wanna write something, huh?

01:00:23.368 --> 01:00:24.835
Here.

01:00:27.505 --> 01:00:29.273
Anything at all.

01:00:39.417 --> 01:00:40.651
F...

01:00:45.423 --> 01:00:46.690
O...

01:00:50.262 --> 01:00:51.862
O...

01:00:57.769 --> 01:00:59.236
Food!

01:01:00.238 --> 01:01:01.071
Food...

01:01:01.105 --> 01:01:03.607
- Food!
- Food, yes!

01:01:04.442 --> 01:01:06.744
Food!
(angrily) Food!

01:01:06.778 --> 01:01:09.280
Yes, food!
If you want something to drink,

01:01:09.314 --> 01:01:10.981
of course you want food!

01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:13.717
(growls)

01:01:17.922 --> 01:01:19.757
Walton:
If you need anything else,

01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:21.558
- just let me know.
- I will, thank you.

01:01:21.593 --> 01:01:23.226
- Morning, Professor.
- Morning.

01:01:23.261 --> 01:01:25.763
Professor,
sorry for the disruption.

01:01:25.797 --> 01:01:27.731
I'm not gonna need
that much of your time.

01:01:27.766 --> 01:01:29.400
- So you're a cop?
- Detective, actually.

01:01:29.434 --> 01:01:32.068
- What's going on?
- Do you know this girl?

01:01:32.103 --> 01:01:34.805
Her name was Lenora Samuels.
She's a student here.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.973
No, I've never seen her.

01:01:37.008 --> 01:01:38.542
Well, she attended
Professor Walton's lecture

01:01:38.576 --> 01:01:39.743
yesterday afternoon.

01:01:39.778 --> 01:01:40.911
Now, a friend of hers said

01:01:41.313 --> 01:01:43.980
that she paid him a visit
last night at the lab.

01:01:44.015 --> 01:01:45.982
She hasn't been seen
or heard since.

01:01:46.017 --> 01:01:48.285
Are you familiar with any of this?

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.054
No, I haven't been to the lab
since yesterday morning.

01:01:53.191 --> 01:01:55.726
The old man inside...
does he have a habit

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.297
of inviting young girls
down to his office after hours?

01:02:00.332 --> 01:02:01.498
Not that I know of.

01:02:04.736 --> 01:02:05.869
I appreciate your time.

01:02:06.304 --> 01:02:08.972
Um... If you hear or see
anything, please let me know.

01:02:09.941 --> 01:02:11.709
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, Officer.

01:02:11.743 --> 01:02:12.976
Yeah?

01:02:13.678 --> 01:02:16.714
Would you mind telling me
what Professor Walton told you?

01:02:16.748 --> 01:02:19.983
Well, he invited her down
to discuss an internship.

01:02:20.017 --> 01:02:22.486
They talked for a few minutes
and then she left.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.920
That's it.

01:02:24.656 --> 01:02:26.824
So... if you hear anything.

01:02:27.425 --> 01:02:28.459
Thank you.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.162
(suspenseful music playing)

01:02:39.537 --> 01:02:40.904
What's going on, Professor?

01:02:40.938 --> 01:02:44.341
Just a misunderstanding.
Poor girl.

01:02:44.376 --> 01:02:46.910
I certainly hope nothing
has happened to her.

01:02:46.944 --> 01:02:48.912
Well what was
she even doing down here,

01:02:48.946 --> 01:02:51.214
and what is this internship?

01:02:51.249 --> 01:02:52.416
What are you talking about?

01:02:52.784 --> 01:02:57.354
The board has allowed me
three undergraduate assistants.

01:02:57.856 --> 01:02:59.757
I offered one of the spots

01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:03.260
to Lenora and
she graciously accepted.

01:03:03.294 --> 01:03:05.161
Well the board didn't
notify me of this.

01:03:05.196 --> 01:03:08.265
Well you do work for me and
naturally the board

01:03:08.299 --> 01:03:10.768
would inform me first, yes?

01:03:10.802 --> 01:03:12.403
(chuckles)

01:03:13.872 --> 01:03:15.439
Have you heard
from Isaac lately?

01:03:16.173 --> 01:03:19.109
I haven't, and neither has
any of his family.

01:03:22.013 --> 01:03:25.582
You were the last person
to talk to him, weren't you?

01:03:25.617 --> 01:03:28.452
That sounds like an accusation.

01:03:28.486 --> 01:03:32.890
Just exactly
what are you implying, Naihla?

01:03:35.693 --> 01:03:37.461
You tell me, Professor!

01:03:38.696 --> 01:03:41.799
Tell you?  Tell you what?

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:45.368
You're talking nonsense,
utter nonsense.

01:03:46.237 --> 01:03:48.138
It seems as though your
headaches are getting worse.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.276
It's not so bad.
They come, they go, they pass.

01:03:56.648 --> 01:03:58.048
Come here.

01:04:01.319 --> 01:04:04.020
I've been meaning
to show you something.

01:04:04.823 --> 01:04:07.023
That's it, closer.

01:04:07.859 --> 01:04:09.326
Closer.

01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:13.730
Do you remember that
chest cavity you discovered?

01:04:13.765 --> 01:04:18.134
I found something intriguing
that might interest you.

01:04:20.404 --> 01:04:22.973
Why don't you
have a look for yourself?

01:04:26.644 --> 01:04:28.211
See for yourself.

01:04:33.117 --> 01:04:34.952
- No!
- What?

01:04:35.353 --> 01:04:36.720
Don't be silly!
Come back here!

01:04:36.988 --> 01:04:39.122
- I have to go, Professor.
- Naihla, we have work to do!

01:04:39.156 --> 01:04:40.156
See you later tonight!

01:04:40.191 --> 01:04:41.525
Professor Kahlil!

01:04:51.636 --> 01:04:52.936
Professor F!

01:04:54.772 --> 01:04:56.239
Missed you in class today.

01:04:56.273 --> 01:04:58.308
I had to leave for a few hours,
family emergency.

01:04:58.342 --> 01:04:59.776
Oh? I hope everything's OK.

01:04:59.811 --> 01:05:02.846
Yes. Everything's fine.
What was your name again?

01:05:02.881 --> 01:05:04.882
- William.
- William, right.

01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:06.850
I just want to tell you that

01:05:07.385 --> 01:05:09.019
what you said in class last week

01:05:09.053 --> 01:05:10.721
about wielding the hand of God...

01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:13.724
I just wanted to tell you
how inspiring that was.

01:05:13.758 --> 01:05:16.259
Oh, thank you,
I really appreciate that, William.

01:05:16.293 --> 01:05:18.595
No, thank you
and it got me thinking

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:21.064
about a lot of things
and I wanted to tell you--

01:05:21.098 --> 01:05:22.900
Listen, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

01:05:22.934 --> 01:05:25.669
We can talk about this
next week after class, all right?

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:31.975
I just wanted to tell you

01:05:32.276 --> 01:05:34.177
that I read about your work
in Switzerland.

01:05:37.982 --> 01:05:39.149
My what?

01:05:39.183 --> 01:05:41.752
Your work... in Switzerland.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.454
You know, with Dr. Grunner.

01:05:45.156 --> 01:05:46.990
How did you hear about that?

01:05:48.225 --> 01:05:51.628
If you dig deep enough,
you can find anything.

01:05:53.431 --> 01:05:54.631
Is it true?

01:05:55.332 --> 01:05:56.967
About the experiments?

01:05:57.635 --> 01:05:58.569
Reanimating dead tiss--

01:05:58.836 --> 01:06:00.604
You listen to me right now,
you little shit!

01:06:00.638 --> 01:06:03.040
You don't tell a soul
about that, do you hear me?

01:06:03.074 --> 01:06:05.042
You keep
your goddam mouth shut.

01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:07.444
OK, I'm sorry.

01:06:10.081 --> 01:06:13.550
I just... I thought that
maybe I could help you,

01:06:15.553 --> 01:06:16.720
OK.

01:06:18.022 --> 01:06:19.355
Sorry.

01:06:38.209 --> 01:06:40.543
Victor:
Naihla, hey, wait up!

01:06:41.145 --> 01:06:42.846
- What do you want?
- Look, I'm sorry.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.750
I know I fucked up.
Are you just gonna walk away?

01:06:48.853 --> 01:06:50.420
You know, Victor?

01:06:50.454 --> 01:06:52.589
I really thought you
were different from most guys.

01:06:52.624 --> 01:06:54.457
- I actually fell for it!
- Naihla...

01:06:54.492 --> 01:06:57.160
I fell for it and you
got what you wanted.  Bravo!

01:06:57.194 --> 01:06:59.029
That is not true at all!

01:06:59.998 --> 01:07:01.498
I care about you, Naihla.

01:07:01.532 --> 01:07:04.400
I'm just involved
in some things that I can't...

01:07:05.103 --> 01:07:07.137
- I don't know how to...
- Victor, really.

01:07:07.171 --> 01:07:08.371
You don't have to stand here

01:07:08.405 --> 01:07:10.306
and try to explain yourself to me.

01:07:10.341 --> 01:07:12.676
Do what you have to do,
whatever is most important.

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:15.145
Look, no hard feelings, OK?
I'll see you around.

01:07:15.179 --> 01:07:16.647
Let me make it up to you.

01:07:17.782 --> 01:07:19.382
Just give me another chance.

01:07:20.518 --> 01:07:23.319
I don't wanna lose you, Naihla.

01:07:23.354 --> 01:07:25.522
That stuff I told you about
when I was a kid...

01:07:27.158 --> 01:07:29.225
I've never let anybody in
like that.

01:07:30.895 --> 01:07:32.095
I can't even explain it.

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:34.364
It's just when I'm with you...

01:07:34.398 --> 01:07:36.199
I feel connected.

01:07:37.168 --> 01:07:39.269
Please, I have to see you again.

01:07:40.104 --> 01:07:41.705
Just give me a second chance.

01:07:44.075 --> 01:07:45.475
Victor...

01:07:47.578 --> 01:07:49.813
- What's that on your hand?
- It's nothing.

01:07:51.448 --> 01:07:53.516
Jesus, is that a bite mark?

01:07:55.219 --> 01:07:57.287
Victor,
where were you last night?

01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:01.158
Answer me!
What aren't you telling me?

01:08:01.192 --> 01:08:03.526
I'm working on something, OK?

01:08:03.561 --> 01:08:04.828
Working on what?

01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:07.130
I can't tell you.

01:08:07.165 --> 01:08:08.965
- Can't tell me?
- I will, I promise,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.633
as soon as the time is right.

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:14.437
Please,
you just have to trust me.

01:08:19.343 --> 01:08:21.277
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:08:23.014 --> 01:08:24.479
I have to go.

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:26.616
Naihla!

01:08:51.075 --> 01:08:53.844
(engine starts up)

01:09:09.593 --> 01:09:12.796
(suspenseful music playing)

01:09:31.215 --> 01:09:33.316
(leaves crunching)

01:10:55.666 --> 01:10:58.468
(suspenseful music plays)

01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:32.702
(suspenseful music plays)

01:11:48.852 --> 01:11:52.389
Victor:  Hey.
Sorry that took me so long.

01:11:55.126 --> 01:11:57.593
Look what I've got!

01:12:04.768 --> 01:12:07.570
(grunting)

01:12:07.604 --> 01:12:08.972
There you go!

01:12:13.244 --> 01:12:14.811
Smells good, huh?

01:12:20.884 --> 01:12:23.886
(grunting)

01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:45.741
Victor:  Tasty?

01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:53.883
Victor:  Mmm.

01:12:57.321 --> 01:12:58.355
(splutters)

01:12:58.389 --> 01:13:00.090
Whoa, whoa, hey!

01:13:00.624 --> 01:13:02.725
You're eating too much, too fast!

01:13:05.963 --> 01:13:09.399
Your digestive system
can't handle that much food yet.

01:13:14.405 --> 01:13:15.938
Fine, suit yourself.

01:13:15.973 --> 01:13:17.640
You're just gonna
get sick again.

01:13:25.549 --> 01:13:27.117
(glass clanking)

01:13:34.492 --> 01:13:37.693
(vomiting)

01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:51.207
- Give me that.
- Monster:  Get away!

01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:57.680
(clattering)
(screams)

01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:01.918
(chains rattle)

01:14:03.154 --> 01:14:04.387
Naihla!

01:14:07.091 --> 01:14:08.158
Naihla!

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.427
(screaming)

01:14:10.794 --> 01:14:13.396
- Naihla, stop screaming!
- Victor, what is that thing?

01:14:13.431 --> 01:14:15.432
Calm down! Stop screaming!

01:14:15.466 --> 01:14:19.169
- Let me go! Let me out of here!
- Calm down! Fuck. Naihla!

01:14:26.277 --> 01:14:27.477
Naihla!

01:14:29.213 --> 01:14:31.147
(sobbing)

01:14:31.182 --> 01:14:32.949
Naihla, please! Don't.

01:14:32.983 --> 01:14:34.384
Please, just let me explain.

01:14:34.418 --> 01:14:36.286
I'm gonna take my hand off
from your mouth.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.854
You have to promise me
you're not gonna scream.

01:14:47.264 --> 01:14:49.031
What did you do, Victor?

01:14:50.067 --> 01:14:52.402
- What was that thing?
- I did it, Naihla!

01:14:52.436 --> 01:14:53.503
Did what?

01:14:54.771 --> 01:14:56.439
That thing you saw down there,
that living, breathing creature...

01:14:56.474 --> 01:14:57.673
I created it!

01:14:57.708 --> 01:14:59.875
I reanimated it from dead tissue!

01:15:01.245 --> 01:15:02.945
I gave it life!

01:15:05.116 --> 01:15:06.849
This can't be happening!

01:15:06.883 --> 01:15:08.918
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

01:15:09.853 --> 01:15:11.254
I've defeated the very thing

01:15:11.288 --> 01:15:12.788
that has plagued mankind since

01:15:12.823 --> 01:15:14.991
we first perceived our
own mortality.

01:15:16.827 --> 01:15:18.928
I've cheated death!

01:15:19.663 --> 01:15:21.631
I don't know who you are!

01:15:21.665 --> 01:15:22.999
Don't say that.

01:15:23.834 --> 01:15:25.868
Stop looking at me
like I'm insane!

01:15:25.902 --> 01:15:28.904
You are, Victor! You're just too
blind to see it! Now let me go!

01:15:28.939 --> 01:15:30.607
Please, Naihla, just calm down.

01:15:30.641 --> 01:15:32.442
- I'm gonna scream!
- Naihla...

01:15:32.476 --> 01:15:34.344
If you don't want 50 people here

01:15:34.378 --> 01:15:37.580
in the next two seconds, you'd
better let me go right now!

01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:41.618
Naihla, please!

01:15:42.253 --> 01:15:43.753
Just don't say anything!

01:15:47.658 --> 01:15:49.725
(growls)

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.561
(snapping)

01:15:51.595 --> 01:15:54.130
- (chains rattling)
- (grunts)

01:16:09.647 --> 01:16:13.149
(suspenseful music plays)

01:17:38.269 --> 01:17:41.937
(indistinct speech over police radio)

01:17:47.077 --> 01:17:50.280
(suspenseful music playing)

01:17:59.189 --> 01:18:01.457
(indistinct speech over police radio)

01:18:20.411 --> 01:18:22.278
(growls)

01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:54.844
(growls)

01:18:54.878 --> 01:18:56.412
(shattering)

01:18:56.647 --> 01:18:59.081
(loud bang)

01:19:44.294 --> 01:19:46.228
(indistinct speech over police radio)

01:20:04.515 --> 01:20:07.249
(indistinct speech over police radio)

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.595
(indistinct speech over police radio)

01:20:34.077 --> 01:20:37.580
(indistinct speech over police radio)

01:20:37.614 --> 01:20:39.081
Dean, come in.

01:20:41.819 --> 01:20:43.619
Dean, where the fuck are you?

01:20:46.156 --> 01:20:47.657
Dean:  <i>Yeah. What do you want?</i>

01:20:47.691 --> 01:20:48.791
You've gotta get down here--

01:20:48.826 --> 01:20:50.025
- (growls)
- (screams)

01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:53.629
(screams)

01:21:05.308 --> 01:21:08.511
(screams)

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:22.625
(indistinct speech over police radio)

01:21:29.566 --> 01:21:31.233
(growls)

01:21:34.037 --> 01:21:36.105
(indistinct speech over police radio)

01:21:59.997 --> 01:22:01.230
Oh, my God!

01:22:19.917 --> 01:22:21.951
Monster:  Hello, Doc!

01:22:27.858 --> 01:22:29.224
Carter.

01:22:31.528 --> 01:22:32.528
(growls)

01:22:48.545 --> 01:22:51.981
(rattling)

01:23:09.299 --> 01:23:10.766
What do you want?

01:23:15.739 --> 01:23:17.139
What do you think?

01:23:17.708 --> 01:23:21.077
I want out of this rotting corpse.

01:23:22.613 --> 01:23:25.314
Your flesh will rejuvenate.
It takes time.

01:23:25.348 --> 01:23:26.782
No.

01:23:27.618 --> 01:23:29.485
There is no time.

01:23:30.453 --> 01:23:33.155
If you transplanted my brain

01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:35.424
into this body that means

01:23:35.458 --> 01:23:38.995
you can transfer it into another.

01:23:39.029 --> 01:23:41.363
I don't know
what you want me to do.

01:23:41.397 --> 01:23:44.700
You're gonna find me another body
tonight.

01:23:45.102 --> 01:23:48.671
A young, healthy body.

01:23:49.139 --> 01:23:52.574
Not one comprised of the dead.

01:23:54.711 --> 01:23:55.845
I can't do that.

01:23:55.879 --> 01:23:57.780
Well, you don't have a choice.

01:23:57.814 --> 01:23:59.749
I can't just kill someone!

01:24:01.652 --> 01:24:03.252
You killed me!

01:24:03.286 --> 01:24:05.487
You were threatening me!

01:24:05.522 --> 01:24:08.524
Well, I'm threatening you now.

01:24:10.393 --> 01:24:13.462
If you don't do this for me,

01:24:14.464 --> 01:24:17.299
you'll never see Naihla again.

01:24:19.703 --> 01:24:20.936
Don't touch her.

01:24:20.971 --> 01:24:25.274
I'm gonna pay her a visit tonight.

01:24:25.308 --> 01:24:27.910
I'm gonna bring her to a place

01:24:27.944 --> 01:24:30.279
where no one will ever find her

01:24:30.313 --> 01:24:33.382
and no one will hear
her screams.

01:24:37.754 --> 01:24:40.622
It stings, doesn't it?

01:24:40.657 --> 01:24:42.124
Can you feel that?

01:24:43.326 --> 01:24:48.297
That pain can be so much worse,

01:24:48.331 --> 01:24:49.932
believe me.

01:24:49.966 --> 01:24:55.705
I can make you suffer more
than you ever thought possible.

01:24:58.709 --> 01:25:00.176
Now,

01:25:01.178 --> 01:25:02.878
do this for me.

01:25:03.814 --> 01:25:08.818
Afterwards, I'll take you to her
and you'll never see me again.

01:25:08.852 --> 01:25:11.787
Carter, please.

01:25:11.822 --> 01:25:13.189
Please!

01:25:14.124 --> 01:25:16.125
I'm not Carter.

01:25:16.893 --> 01:25:18.660
I'm just a monster.

01:25:21.664 --> 01:25:25.735
Let's see if you still have
that address.

01:25:30.974 --> 01:25:32.241
Yeah.

01:25:32.843 --> 01:25:37.379
Stoney Brook Lane, man.
I know just where it is.

01:25:39.449 --> 01:25:41.884
Son of a bitch!
I'll fucking kill you!

01:25:44.187 --> 01:25:46.255
Sit tight, Doc!

01:25:46.289 --> 01:25:47.790
I'll be back soon.

01:25:47.824 --> 01:25:49.625
Victor:
Don't touch her, you hear me?

01:25:50.093 --> 01:25:51.627
Don't you touch her!

01:27:23.153 --> 01:27:25.120
- Oh, God!
- (rats squeaking)

01:27:25.155 --> 01:27:27.756
(coughs)

01:27:33.796 --> 01:27:36.798
(rats squeaking)

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.774
Jesus Christ!

01:27:47.443 --> 01:27:49.945
(Userkare growls)

01:27:51.081 --> 01:27:53.048
(struggling)

01:27:53.984 --> 01:27:55.150
(roars)

01:27:55.185 --> 01:27:56.618
Fuck!

01:27:59.455 --> 01:28:01.790
Help! Help!

01:28:26.049 --> 01:28:27.682
(knocking on door)

01:28:29.119 --> 01:28:30.352
Who is it?

01:28:33.756 --> 01:28:34.890
Hello!

01:28:35.491 --> 01:28:36.926
(tapping)

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.061
Who's there?

01:28:41.097 --> 01:28:42.697
Victor, is that you?

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.069
If you don't answer right now,
I'm calling the police.

01:28:48.371 --> 01:28:50.039
(cell phone vibrates)

01:28:56.712 --> 01:28:58.113
Victor, is that you?

01:29:02.618 --> 01:29:04.853
God.
Why won't you answer me?

01:29:05.989 --> 01:29:08.023
(knocking on door)

01:29:08.058 --> 01:29:09.658
(suspenseful music plays)

01:29:15.432 --> 01:29:16.498
- Operator:  <i>911 emergency.</i>
- Yes.

01:29:16.699 --> 01:29:17.766
Someone's trying to get in my house.

01:29:19.035 --> 01:29:20.436
- Can you please send help?
- Operator:  <i>OK, just stay calm.</i>

01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:21.337
<i>What is your location?</i>

01:29:21.371 --> 01:29:23.238
2670 Stoney Brick Lane.

01:29:23.273 --> 01:29:25.341
Operator:  <i>Sit tight.</i>
<i>The police are on their way.</i>

01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:26.575
OK.

01:29:27.477 --> 01:29:28.844
(gasps)

01:29:29.479 --> 01:29:30.645
Oh, my God!

01:29:31.014 --> 01:29:32.481
Operator:  <i>Ma'am, I need you</i>
<i>to talk to me.</i>

01:29:32.515 --> 01:29:34.483
They just cut the power.

01:29:34.517 --> 01:29:36.085
I'm really scared!
Please hurry!

01:29:36.119 --> 01:29:37.686
Operator:  <i>Everything's gonna</i>
<i>be OK, don't worry.</i>

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.721
<i>Is the intruder in the house?</i>

01:29:39.755 --> 01:29:42.257
I don't think so, but I don't know.

01:29:42.292 --> 01:29:44.293
Operator:  <i>Make sure all</i>
<i>the doors are locked.</i>

01:29:44.327 --> 01:29:47.596
<i>Are there any other ways into</i>
<i>the house?  Basement, backyard?</i>

01:29:47.630 --> 01:29:49.331
No, everything's locked.

01:29:49.366 --> 01:29:50.565
Operator:  <i>Windows?</i>

01:29:55.905 --> 01:29:58.907
(wind whistling)

01:30:11.354 --> 01:30:13.188
(crying)

01:30:15.025 --> 01:30:17.159
Hello, Professor.

01:30:17.793 --> 01:30:20.595
So nice to see you again.

01:30:20.630 --> 01:30:22.331
What do you want?

01:30:22.365 --> 01:30:25.667
My, you're so beautiful.

01:30:26.769 --> 01:30:28.737
Please, stop, please!

01:30:31.541 --> 01:30:35.644
If you scream,
I'll tear you into shreds.

01:30:42.085 --> 01:30:43.552
Look at me.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.088
- No.
- Look at me!

01:30:47.557 --> 01:30:49.491
You see what he did to me?

01:30:53.329 --> 01:30:55.764
Your loving Victor?

01:30:56.999 --> 01:30:59.234
Where is he?
What have you done to him?

01:31:00.937 --> 01:31:02.571
Nothing yet.

01:31:03.739 --> 01:31:07.409
I need him
to get me out of this body,

01:31:07.444 --> 01:31:11.880
and you're gonna ensure
that he does it.

01:31:14.050 --> 01:31:14.916
No.

01:31:16.052 --> 01:31:21.056
It's been so long since
I've tasted a woman like you.

01:31:22.058 --> 01:31:23.092
Stop!

01:31:26.196 --> 01:31:28.730
We're leaving now.

01:31:28.764 --> 01:31:33.469
But first,
I want you to give us a kiss.

01:31:33.503 --> 01:31:34.803
No!

01:31:36.506 --> 01:31:38.006
Stick out your tongue!

01:31:40.843 --> 01:31:43.011
I said stick out
you're fucking tongue

01:31:43.045 --> 01:31:45.581
or I'll rip it
out of your throat.

01:31:49.452 --> 01:31:50.785
Yeah!

01:31:55.391 --> 01:31:58.026
(crying)

01:32:09.872 --> 01:32:11.140
(groans)

01:32:18.881 --> 01:32:22.251
No, no, no, no! Let me go!

01:32:22.285 --> 01:32:25.287
(dogs barking)

01:32:43.806 --> 01:32:47.008
(music playing)

01:32:53.183 --> 01:32:55.584
Professor, why?

01:32:55.618 --> 01:32:59.087
You were right, Naihla.
You were right.

01:33:00.723 --> 01:33:03.058
The curse is real.

01:33:04.627 --> 01:33:06.828
Userkare lives...

01:33:08.698 --> 01:33:10.765
...and he wants you!

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.467
(chuckles)

01:33:13.135 --> 01:33:16.071
He believes
you're the sorceress

01:33:16.105 --> 01:33:19.408
who damned
his soul for eternity.

01:33:20.677 --> 01:33:27.416
I hope you've had extensive training
in the black arts.

01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:29.150
You're gonna need it!

01:33:36.158 --> 01:33:38.093
No! No!

01:33:39.596 --> 01:33:41.162
(groans loudly)

01:34:25.441 --> 01:34:27.643
Don't scream!

01:34:27.677 --> 01:34:30.312
Don't make
even the slightest sound.

01:34:30.346 --> 01:34:32.046
He will kill you.

01:34:35.918 --> 01:34:37.519
Walton:  I did as you asked.

01:34:37.553 --> 01:34:39.454
Here is the one you seek.

01:34:43.826 --> 01:34:45.994
(speaking in foreign language)

01:34:51.867 --> 01:34:53.669
What do you want?

01:34:53.703 --> 01:34:58.473
Break the spell
and release his soul.

01:34:58.508 --> 01:34:59.841
I can't!

01:34:59.875 --> 01:35:01.443
I suggest you try.

01:35:01.477 --> 01:35:05.113
If you fail,
his cruelty knows no bounds.

01:35:05.147 --> 01:35:07.248
Professor Walton,
please, help me!

01:35:07.283 --> 01:35:10.352
I'm sorry, Naihla.
There's nothing I can do.

01:35:17.727 --> 01:35:19.394
(gasping)

01:35:22.665 --> 01:35:25.867
(growls)

01:35:28.003 --> 01:35:30.104
What good is your magic

01:35:30.139 --> 01:35:34.175
and ancient spells now,
Professor?

01:35:40.082 --> 01:35:41.983
Don't despair, my king,

01:35:42.017 --> 01:35:46.120
we shall find the one
who will undo the spell!

01:35:53.996 --> 01:35:55.764
(speaking in foreign language)

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.120
No!

01:36:25.895 --> 01:36:28.864
My lord, don't listen to her!

01:36:28.898 --> 01:36:31.933
She sets a trap to ensnare you!

01:36:37.774 --> 01:36:39.841
You, lying little bitch!

01:36:47.817 --> 01:36:50.084
(Userkare growls)

01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:59.961
That was a good try, my dear!

01:36:59.995 --> 01:37:03.465
Unfortunately, not good enough.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.836
(speaking in foreign language)

01:37:34.931 --> 01:37:38.132
(groaning)

01:38:29.785 --> 01:38:32.988
(screaming)

01:38:50.506 --> 01:38:53.074
(hissing)

01:39:09.692 --> 01:39:11.192
(gunshots)

01:39:27.059 --> 01:39:28.460
Victor!

01:39:31.698 --> 01:39:33.064
Naihla:  <i>Victor!</i>

01:39:33.633 --> 01:39:34.833
Naihla?

01:39:34.867 --> 01:39:35.900
Victor!

01:39:35.935 --> 01:39:37.936
Naihla, I'm over here!

01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:40.038
- Victor!
- Naihla, I'm over here.

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.441
Oh, my God, Victor!

01:39:45.378 --> 01:39:46.812
Help me break these chains!

01:39:46.846 --> 01:39:49.080
- No, get back!
- What? Where did you get that?

01:39:49.114 --> 01:39:50.449
I said get back!

01:39:55.588 --> 01:39:56.655
I'm so sorry.

01:39:57.957 --> 01:40:01.393
Look at me. I'm so, so sorry.

01:40:02.928 --> 01:40:04.896
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

01:40:04.930 --> 01:40:06.097
OK.

01:40:06.799 --> 01:40:10.034
It's gonna be OK, but we've
gotta get out of here now.  Go!

01:40:27.387 --> 01:40:28.720
Victor:  Holy shit!

01:40:32.558 --> 01:40:34.626
Come on, Victor,
we have to get out of here!

01:40:38.197 --> 01:40:41.132
(gunshots)

01:40:51.043 --> 01:40:52.744
(Userkare growls)

01:40:52.779 --> 01:40:54.880
(coughing, struggling)

01:40:55.247 --> 01:40:56.648
(whimpering)

01:40:57.417 --> 01:40:59.284
(speaking in foreign language)

01:41:11.597 --> 01:41:13.632
No! Victor!

01:41:23.275 --> 01:41:24.676
Naihla, run!

01:41:28.113 --> 01:41:29.347
(blade cuts through air)

01:41:29.381 --> 01:41:31.550
(screams)
(cries)

01:41:32.585 --> 01:41:34.820
(whimpers)

01:41:36.355 --> 01:41:39.390
(Naihla hyperventilating)

01:41:43.362 --> 01:41:45.296
(strained groans)

01:41:54.607 --> 01:41:57.843
(speaking in foreign language)

01:42:02.314 --> 01:42:05.450
(both growling)

01:42:17.429 --> 01:42:19.397
What the fuck?

01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:36.581
Oh, my God!

01:42:40.753 --> 01:42:41.820
Victor!

01:42:54.199 --> 01:42:56.902
(growls)

01:42:56.936 --> 01:42:59.838
(growls)

01:43:16.221 --> 01:43:20.224
(grunting)
(growling)

01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:58.262
Victor, you have to try
and get up, OK.

01:43:58.297 --> 01:44:00.331
I'm right here. Let's try, OK?

01:44:00.365 --> 01:44:03.868
- Let's go. One, two, three!
- (groans)

01:44:10.977 --> 01:44:15.246
Victor. It's OK, just breathe.
Just breathe, OK?

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:16.982
Take deep breaths, OK?

01:44:21.153 --> 01:44:23.622
(growls triumphantly)

01:44:26.859 --> 01:44:30.461
Victor, please,
don't let go of me!

01:44:31.063 --> 01:44:32.296
Victor!

01:44:54.453 --> 01:44:56.420
Monster:  Motherfucker!

01:45:00.026 --> 01:45:01.425
(beating)

01:45:42.835 --> 01:45:43.835
No.

01:45:59.484 --> 01:46:00.852
No.

01:46:01.721 --> 01:46:03.755
No, no!

01:46:08.327 --> 01:46:10.729
You made this happen!

01:46:14.533 --> 01:46:16.567
Monster:  You did this!

01:46:19.271 --> 01:46:22.640
Now I am trapped in this body.

01:46:36.956 --> 01:46:40.558
No, no, no, please don't do--

01:46:40.592 --> 01:46:42.761
You'll like this face.

01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:47.966
Just remember,
he did this to you!

01:46:50.169 --> 01:46:52.170
(Naihla struggles)

01:46:59.812 --> 01:47:01.612
Naihla:  No! Please!

01:47:05.885 --> 01:47:07.051
Carter!

01:47:10.555 --> 01:47:11.990
(screams)

01:47:32.845 --> 01:47:34.946
Naihla:  Victor, come here!

01:47:37.817 --> 01:47:39.017
Victor!

01:47:40.319 --> 01:47:41.886
I don't want you to die.

01:47:42.454 --> 01:47:44.189
I came back for you.

01:47:45.224 --> 01:47:46.724
Stay with me, Victor.

01:47:46.758 --> 01:47:48.659
It's OK. Help is gonna come.

01:47:49.795 --> 01:47:52.330
You're gonna have one
hell of a story.

01:47:52.364 --> 01:47:53.764
Is that so?

01:47:55.301 --> 01:47:56.801
Don't talk, don't talk.

01:47:56.836 --> 01:47:59.704
(chokes)
(splutters)

01:48:02.942 --> 01:48:04.508
What?

01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:07.111
Jacket.

01:48:08.047 --> 01:48:09.613
Second pocket.

01:48:10.749 --> 01:48:12.717
No one must know.

01:48:13.652 --> 01:48:15.920
You have to promise me
you'll destroy...

01:48:15.955 --> 01:48:17.455
I promise.

01:48:17.489 --> 01:48:18.857
I promise.

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:22.093
It's OK.

01:48:26.798 --> 01:48:28.199
I love you, Naihla.

01:48:31.737 --> 01:48:33.704
And I love you too, Victor.

01:48:43.382 --> 01:48:45.716
- (exhales)
- Victor.

01:48:45.751 --> 01:48:48.686
Victor!
(crying)

01:48:49.321 --> 01:48:50.688
Victor!

01:48:51.891 --> 01:48:53.124
Victor!

01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:57.061
(crying)

01:48:57.096 --> 01:48:58.196
Victor!

01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:14.812
(splashing)

01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:43.741
(slow music playing)

01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:18.269
Victor's voice:
<i>The subject is aggressive.</i>

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:21.339
<i>He's only displaying primitive</i>
<i>and animalistic behavior.</i>

01:51:21.907 --> 01:51:24.209
<i>- I guess a transplant...</i>
Monster:  <i>Water...</i>

01:51:27.513 --> 01:51:28.846
<i>What did you say?</i>

01:51:32.384 --> 01:51:35.520
(tape rewinding)

01:51:35.554 --> 01:51:39.123
<i>Tuesday January 14th 2013.</i>

01:51:39.157 --> 01:51:41.158
<i>My name is Victor Frankenstein</i>

01:51:41.827 --> 01:51:45.496
<i>and I'm about to embark</i>
<i>on a journey of discovery</i>

01:51:47.199 --> 01:51:49.234
<i>that will change the world forever.</i>
