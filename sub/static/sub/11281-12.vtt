EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #050

CLOSED CAPTIONED

00:02.836 --> 00:03.704
CHRIS ROCK:
After months
of being around Tasha,

00:03.737 --> 00:04.405
we had become
really good friends.

00:04.438 --> 00:05.039
"Wake Me Up
Before You Go

00:05.073 --> 00:06.207
What does that even mean?

00:06.240 --> 00:07.141
The problem was: I didn't want
to be just a friend.

00:07.175 --> 00:10.444
I wanted to get
out of the friend zone

00:10.478 --> 00:12.513
and into the lover zone,

00:12.546 --> 00:14.482
and the only way was
to swing for the fences.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.716
Can I ask you a question?

00:15.749 --> 00:17.051
Yeah.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.352
Will you go with me?

00:18.386 --> 00:20.454
Go where?

00:20.488 --> 00:22.323
Strike one.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.226
No, I mean, like,
go together.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.195
We are together.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.629
Strike two!

00:29.863 --> 00:32.800
No, I mean, like,
you and me go out.

00:32.833 --> 00:33.834
What?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.304
Strike three and you're out!

00:36.337 --> 00:38.072
Boy, you so crazy.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.807
:
Yeah, I'm so crazy.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.342
Are you about to go home?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.843
Yeah, to cry.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.545
Yeah, I guess.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.480
Since the direct approach
didn't work,

00:46.514 --> 00:48.349
I wondered what would.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.184
I thought about being romantic.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.519
Chris, what are you doing?

00:51.552 --> 00:53.854
These are for you.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.290
Boy, you're so crazy.

00:56.324 --> 00:57.591
I thought
about being chivalrous.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.160
Allow me.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.364
Boy, you so crazy.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.634
Boy, is that
your good jacket?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.136
No.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.504
I even thought
about being brave.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.574
Hey... why don't y'all
leave her alone?

01:13.607 --> 01:16.310
* Somebody tell me...

01:16.344 --> 01:17.511
CHRIS:
Oh, God!

01:20.781 --> 01:23.117
Boy, you so crazy!

01:23.151 --> 01:25.819
No matter what I did,
she always said the same thing.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.621
I'm glad we're friends.

01:27.655 --> 01:28.822
That makes one of us.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.192
I think you're, like, one
of the funniest people I know.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.493
Thanks.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.330
Friends don't let friends
die lonely.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.840
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:50.878 --> 01:54.848
.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.365
While I tried
to kick the Tasha blues,

02:11.399 --> 02:13.167
my father came bearing news.
Hey.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.202
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, everybody.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.203
Hi, baby.
Hey.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.605
I've got good news.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.807
You finally kicked the gout?
No.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.310
Chris isn't
your real son?
No.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.844
Lionel Richie is back
with The Commodores?

02:23.877 --> 02:24.845
No.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.847
Did you trade Tonya
to the devil for cable?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.249
No.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.618
I am Employee of the Month.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.752
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.554
That's nice, baby.
That's great.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.289
Aren't you going
to ask me what I got?

02:35.323 --> 02:37.225
A raise?
No.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.859
Well, what did you get?
Your regular pay

02:38.892 --> 02:40.361
and a kick in the ass.

02:40.394 --> 02:44.332
A coupon for a free dinner
for six at Domaine et Mer.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.300
ALL:
Domain...

02:46.334 --> 02:47.701
Mayor?
CHRIS:
The man is where?

02:47.735 --> 02:49.237
Is that Russian?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.371
DREW:
No, that's Spanish.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.272
No, baby, it's French.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.874
Ah, dinner for six,
that sounds nice.

02:54.742 --> 02:55.909
But there's only five of us.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.478
DREW:
Yeah.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.546
Maybe we can
bring somebody.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.780
Wait a minute now.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.449
This sounds like a nice place.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.850
We can't just bring anybody.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.752
We thought
about bringing Vanessa.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.587
I dated a French guy once.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.256
I can't stand French food.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.457
I mean,
hors d'oeuvres.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.925
Who wants a piece of liver
on a toothpick?

03:11.959 --> 03:13.461
You got any chimichangas?

03:13.494 --> 03:14.762
We thought about Jerome.

03:14.795 --> 03:15.829
Uh...

03:15.863 --> 03:17.298
excuse me,
garÃ§on.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.766
Can we get
some more silverware?

03:18.799 --> 03:19.833
I just put some out.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.303
:
I don't know
what happened to it.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.475
We even thought about Mr. Omar.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.277
Oh, my God!

03:29.310 --> 03:30.278
He's choking!

03:30.311 --> 03:31.279
Help him!

03:31.312 --> 03:32.480
Hold on!

03:32.513 --> 03:33.947
There's nothing we can do.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.984
But he's still choking.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.886
Not anymore.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.621
Tragic.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.989
Uh-uh.

03:42.022 --> 03:42.990
You know what?

03:43.023 --> 03:45.326
We need to bring
somebody classy.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.261
Let me think about it.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.663
I was still hoping to make
some progress with Tasha,

03:49.697 --> 03:51.399
but Greg was convinced
all hope was lost.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.401
Dude, once a friend,
always a friend.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.668
It's the
Westermarck effect.

03:54.702 --> 03:55.736
West what?

03:55.769 --> 03:56.737
Edward Westermarck.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.805
He was a scientist.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.640
He concluded that
when two people live together

03:59.673 --> 04:02.610
in close proximity
during the early years of life,

04:02.643 --> 04:04.044
they will never become
boyfriend and girlfriend.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.913
That means I still have
a chance with Shakira.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.781
There's got to be some
way for her to see me

04:07.815 --> 04:08.849
as more than just a friend.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.484
What kind of boys
does she like?

04:10.518 --> 04:11.985
I don't know.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.422
Well, maybe you should ask
some other girls.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.789
You'll get some ideas.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.591
When you ask girls
what they like,

04:17.625 --> 04:20.428
I found out you learn two
things: everything and nothing.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.563
So what type of guys
do you like?

04:22.596 --> 04:23.997
I like dumb guys.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.599
I like tall guys.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.900
I like girls.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.803
Not interesting now,
but it will be later.

04:29.837 --> 04:30.804
Free spirits.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.706
Nice guys.
Bad boys.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.842
ALL:
Rich.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.043
Thanks.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.545
I thought that was bad.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.046
Then I found out
I wasn't the only guy

04:39.079 --> 04:40.681
that didn't know anything
about women.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.584
Girls like it
when you give them compliments.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.685
Hey, baby,

04:44.718 --> 04:47.455
I'm no Fred Flintstone,
but I can make your Bedrock.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.458
Shut up, idiot.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.792
I wasn't even talking to her.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.628
Hey, baby, what you doing?

04:56.497 --> 04:59.099
Julius, I'm gonna need
a few extra dollars this week.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.501
For what?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.436
Well, we can't go
to a nice restaurant

05:02.470 --> 05:04.705
looking like
"Who let you in?"

05:04.738 --> 05:05.939
I'm gonna need
a new dress.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.742
The boys need haircuts.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.511
And I need a new pair
of shoes.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.413
So does Tonya.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.682
I saw
these fake eyelashes...

05:14.715 --> 05:16.850
There's this really nice shawl
that goes with the dress.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.821
Pantyhose.
Only my mother could make
a free dinner expensive.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.624
After getting every answer
under the sun,

05:23.657 --> 05:25.125
I figured the only way
to find out

05:25.158 --> 05:27.528
what Tasha liked
was to ask Tasha.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.729
Tag.

05:28.762 --> 05:29.997
You need to borrow
some detergent?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.064
No, it's okay.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.132
My grandma's ticky.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.567
If I get the wrong soap,

05:33.601 --> 05:35.436
she says it's going
to make her butt itch.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.470
Do you have any quarters?

05:36.504 --> 05:39.039
Yeah.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.141
You know, I didn't expect
to see you here today.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.810
I always do laundry
on Wednesdays.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.944
I told you that.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.779
Oh, yeah, I must
have forgot.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.915
Don't you just hate
doing laundry?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.683
Yeah.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.752
But, you know,
I guess it'd be kind of cool

05:51.785 --> 05:54.755
if you had a boyfriend
to do it for you.

05:54.788 --> 05:55.623
No.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.658
What kind of man does
a woman's laundry?

05:57.691 --> 05:58.926
Strike one!

05:59.993 --> 06:01.762
Yeah, no, that
wouldn't be cool.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.431
I-I wouldn't do that.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.165
I'd be like, "Woman, you
better do my laundry."

06:05.198 --> 06:06.434
And I guess you want her

06:06.467 --> 06:08.068
barefoot and pregnant,
too, huh?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.537
Strike two!

06:09.570 --> 06:11.639
Nah.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.541
I was just kidding.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.576
All right,
don't mess this one up.

06:15.609 --> 06:19.547
So if you could go out with any
type of guy, who would you pick?

06:19.580 --> 06:23.150
I know this is going
to sound funny, but...

06:23.183 --> 06:24.752
I'd go with Slaver Slav.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.753
Who?

06:25.786 --> 06:28.689
Slaver Slav is
the preeminent bad boy of rap,

06:28.722 --> 06:30.858
the top recording act
at Setback Records.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.626
He is responsible
for the hit album

06:32.660 --> 06:34.562
I'm Smacking
and Stabbing Somebody.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.929
At the tender age of 16,

06:35.963 --> 06:37.431
Slaver Slav was released
from prison

06:37.465 --> 06:40.534
after serving 17 years
for aggravated battery.

06:40.568 --> 06:44.137
This is Slaver Slav's first mug
shot, but it wasn't his last.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.973
He released his first single

06:46.006 --> 06:48.542
"Put Me in Jail Again and
I'll Smack the Stank Off You"

06:48.576 --> 06:49.577
about a month later.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.445
The rest is history.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.847
Slaver Slav?

06:53.881 --> 06:54.815
Why?

06:54.848 --> 06:55.849
He's a bad boy.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.185
I mean, you never know
what he's going to do next.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.987
Yeah, stab you or shoot you.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.321
All the girls like him.

07:01.354 --> 07:05.559
Now if I could just get locked
up, I could finally get lucky.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.160
Wait,
that didn't come out right.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.869
Hey, man, I've been
looking for you.
What's up?

07:15.903 --> 07:18.772
I've got every tape and
article on Slaver Slav.
My wigga!

07:18.806 --> 07:22.743
All you have to do is
study him, learn him, be him.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.478
Thanks.
No problem.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.014
Watching Slaver Slav,

07:27.047 --> 07:30.017
I learned the most important
thing about being a bad boy.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.486
When it comes to girls,
the meaner the better,

07:32.520 --> 07:34.988
and whatever you do,
don't be nice.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.625
* Girls be talking
about what they like *

07:37.658 --> 07:38.659
* I don't care

07:38.692 --> 07:39.660
* 'Cause I ain't nice

07:39.693 --> 07:42.195
* I talked to you once,
don't call me twice *

07:42.229 --> 07:44.898
* Kiss my ass, girl,
I ain't nice *

07:44.932 --> 07:47.901
* I got no manners,
I wear bandannas *

07:47.935 --> 07:50.604
* Word on the street
is I'm bananas *

07:50.638 --> 07:52.640
* I got a lot of money,
I'm cold as ice *

07:52.673 --> 07:55.275
* So get out my face,
ho, I ain't nice *

07:55.308 --> 07:57.878
* I ain't nice, I ain't nice

07:57.911 --> 08:00.614
* Ha, ha, Slaver Slav!

08:05.586 --> 08:07.621
That girl on the left
eventually had a baby

08:07.655 --> 08:09.990
with Ghostface Killah.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.263
Chris, I hear your father
got Employee of the Month

08:16.296 --> 08:17.264
down at the paper.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.499
Yeah.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.904
They still giving out
their free dinners?

08:23.937 --> 08:24.772
Uh-huh.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.240
Subtlety was not
Doc's strong suit.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.544
Uh, that's usually
for six people, right?

08:30.578 --> 08:32.813
Uh-huh, I'm thinking
about asking Tasha to go.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.848
Oh, Tasha.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.184
'Cause she looks better
in a dress.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.852
Slaver Slav.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.288
The bad boy
of rap.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.255
You know him?

08:42.289 --> 08:46.794
Yeah, he broke up
with my best buddy's niece.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.862
That boy is bad.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.832
He treated her like nothing,
and she still loved him.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.000
See, that's what
I don't get.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.135
I don't understand why girls
like you to treat them bad.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.270
Chris, women are crazy.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.673
They think just
because they get a bad boy,

08:59.707 --> 09:02.710
they'll be so special
that they'll be the only ones

09:02.743 --> 09:04.645
to make him treat
a girl nice.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.781
It's just like trying
to climb Mount Everest.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.950
Every now and then,
somebody does it,

09:09.983 --> 09:12.019
but they usually end up
in a snow cave,

09:12.052 --> 09:13.086
chewing on their own leg.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.222
Analogies were not
Doc's strong suit either.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.257
Are we still
talking about girls?

09:17.290 --> 09:21.094
Chris, all I'm trying to say
is Slaver Slav figured it out.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.064
If you want a girl
to go crazy over you,

09:24.097 --> 09:25.933
be like Mount Everest.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.200
Be difficult.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.670
Try to get to her
to eat her own leg off.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.973
And whatever you do,
don't be nice.

09:33.006 --> 09:36.343
And again I say there's
a reason why Doc lives alone.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.312
I was a bad boy years before
Martin Lawrence and Will Smith.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.748
Hey, Chris.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.149
Do I know you?

09:42.182 --> 09:44.117
You don't remember me?
Do I look like I remember you?

09:44.151 --> 09:45.653
I'm Yolanda.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.387
Yolanda?
No. Sonia.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.122
Why you acting
all funny?

09:49.156 --> 09:51.291
Look, I'm just trying to read.
Why don't you go do something?

09:51.324 --> 09:53.360
I just wanted to talk
to you for a minute. Dag!

09:53.393 --> 09:54.728
Did you come here

09:54.762 --> 09:56.363
to buy something
or just get on my nerves?

09:56.396 --> 09:59.032
How come every time I come in
here, you always playing me off?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.001
What's your name again?
It's Carla.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.070
Does your head just do that,
or is that a nervous condition?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.972
You ain't got to talk
about nobody.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.674
What's up with that hat?
You don't like it?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.375
If it's covering up a bald spot,
it's fine.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.843
It's much better than your hair.

10:09.877 --> 10:10.978
What's wrong
with my hair?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.245
What's not wrong with your hair?

10:12.279 --> 10:14.715
Call me.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.717
Call me.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.351
Call me.

10:18.385 --> 10:22.322
* If we talked,
what words could I describe... *

10:22.355 --> 10:24.825
I didn't know
if this would work on Tasha,

10:24.858 --> 10:26.927
or if she had too much
self-esteem.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.095
Hey, Chris.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.196
What?

10:29.229 --> 10:31.298
I said hi.
What's wrong with you?

10:31.331 --> 10:32.966
Why does something got
to be wrong with me?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.101
Maybe you just didn't say hi
loud enough.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.169
Forget it.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.270
Damn!

10:37.304 --> 10:40.140
Why did I listen to an old fool
that lives alone?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.042
Did I do something to you?

10:42.075 --> 10:43.210
No, but I wish you would.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.177
Girl, ain't nobody
thinking about you.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.345
Okay.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.680
Except me.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.148
* Cold-blooded,
the way you walk *

10:48.181 --> 10:49.750
Are you going to the bus stop?

10:49.783 --> 10:50.918
Yeah. Why?

10:50.951 --> 10:52.219
Do you want me
to walk with you?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.186
I don't care.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.354
* Sexy *

10:54.387 --> 10:56.890
* Mama, you're too cold for me

10:56.924 --> 10:58.892
You're trippin'.

10:58.926 --> 11:02.229
And you're falling for it.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.065
* Who are you...

11:05.098 --> 11:07.467
I heard your father made
Employee of the Month.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.969
Who told you that?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.070
Tonya.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.071
Oh.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.405
The girl talk too much.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.807
That's true.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.175
You didn't want
me to know?

11:15.208 --> 11:18.078
Nah, it's just that
she be running her mouth.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.813
I got this free dinner

11:19.847 --> 11:22.415
at this place where
Slaver Slav eats-- place called

11:22.449 --> 11:23.984
Domaine et Mer.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.086
He might be ignorant,
but he loves good food.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.256
Slaver Slav? Wow.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.925
Yeah. My mom wants
to invite one more person.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.160
I'm, like,
"Yo, Mom, bus' it.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.262
Why we got
to take one more person?"

11:35.295 --> 11:36.229
There's more food for us.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.131
I wish I could go.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.067
He says the food
is incredible.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.002
Yeah, well,
that's what we gonna do.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.471
If you want to come,
then come on.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.473
Are you asking me to go?

11:46.506 --> 11:49.276
I ain't asking you twice.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.310
Thanks.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.346
MAN :
It's a home run!

11:53.380 --> 11:55.983
And that ball is out of here.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.751
Hey, Ma.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.219
Hey, sweetie.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.954
Found somebody
to go to dinner with us.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.122
Oh, that's okay, baby.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.290
I decided to
take Michael.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.992
Uncle Michael's
coming?
Yeah, man.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.293
I heard
French food

12:06.326 --> 12:07.394
real good!

12:07.427 --> 12:09.229
That's French.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.364
I've been studying,
'cause I'm ready to go.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.301
Ooh, la, la. I can't wait.

12:14.334 --> 12:18.138
And I can't wait for you
to choke on that spaghetti.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.977
CHRIS ROCK:
Trying to take a free meal
away from my uncle Michael

12:24.011 --> 12:25.913
was like trying to take a bone
away from a pit bull.

12:25.946 --> 12:26.980
Let me get this straight.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.817
You want me to give up
a free dinner for a girl?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.318
Michael, please.
I already invited her.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.787
I've been trying to get with her
for I don't know how long.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.322
If I blow this, probably
won't get another chance.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.924
I don't know.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.892
What do I get out of it?

12:38.926 --> 12:40.193
What do you want?

12:40.227 --> 12:41.795
The one thing my uncle loved

12:41.829 --> 12:43.831
more than a free meal
was a bunch of free meals.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.498
All it took was
a shrimp basket...

12:45.532 --> 12:47.234
What's up?
What's up?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.902
Mmm! Later.
Later.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.437
...and a slopper.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.205
Hmm. What's up?
What's up?

12:52.239 --> 12:53.273
Mmm. Later.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.541
Later.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.477
What's all this?

12:57.510 --> 12:58.946
Well, I just thought

12:58.979 --> 13:00.480
that since we're going
to a nice restaurant,

13:00.513 --> 13:02.315
we need to brush up
on our manners.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.251
I don't want y'all in there
embarrassing me.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.518
For a free meal, I don't care

13:05.552 --> 13:07.387
if y'all showed up
butt-naked with socks on.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.589
If we were butt-naked,
we wouldn't have socks on,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.024
would we?

13:11.058 --> 13:12.325
We're not even there yet,
and I'm already

13:12.359 --> 13:14.895
embarrassed.
What's going on?

13:14.928 --> 13:17.230
Mom is trying to teach us
manners before we go out.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.333
Manners? Who's going to teach us
how to use all these forks?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.135
I'm getting to that.
Where's Michael?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.370
He's the one needs
to learn some manners.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.471
Oh, yeah, Uncle Michael
stopped by earlier.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.939
He can't make it to dinner.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.208
Oh, well, I don't know
who else to invite.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.977
How about Tasha?
ALL:
Tasha?

13:30.010 --> 13:32.312
Do I have to buy everybody
shrimp and sloppers?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.146
Is that okay with you, baby?

13:33.180 --> 13:35.448
Sounds like
a good idea.
Oh, good.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.185
Translation:
she eats like a white girl.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.421
My father was really excited,
but he was about to find out

13:41.454 --> 13:43.290
that his free dinner
had a high price.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.125
Good evening, sir.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.293
May I help you?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.528
Yes. We have a
reservation for six.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.530
Um, it was made
by the newspaper.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.933
I'm the Employee
of the Month.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.335
That look means,
"Oh, great, poor people."

13:55.368 --> 13:56.436
Employee of the Month,

13:56.469 --> 13:57.938
party of six.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.306
I don't have anything available
right now,

13:59.339 --> 14:02.009
but if you have a seat,
I'll be right with you.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.244
Never trust a black man
who speaks French.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.114
Hi. Banks party
for six, 8:00 p.m.?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.248
Bonsoir, Mr. Banks.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.482
Right this way.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.018
Ah, good.
Come on, gang.

14:11.051 --> 14:11.985
Oui, oui.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.553
Oui, oui really means
white, white.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.955
Bon appÃ©tit!

14:14.988 --> 14:16.423
Thank you.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.464
She's about to smack
the duck liver out of him.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.200
May I help you?

14:27.234 --> 14:29.970
I thought you said you didn't
have anything available.

14:30.003 --> 14:30.904
We don't.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.673
But you had something available
for them.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.543
They are... how do I put this?

14:36.576 --> 14:37.978
They are paying.

14:38.011 --> 14:38.678
They're white.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.680
Oh, hold on.
We're paying.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.481
No, you're not.

14:41.514 --> 14:42.950
You're not white!

14:42.983 --> 14:44.384
We provide the newspaper

14:44.417 --> 14:46.453
with one complimentary table
a month.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.489
The provide us
with a reduced ad rate.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.158
So you're not paying.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.559
Now, if you check your coupon...

14:52.592 --> 14:54.694
You do have your coupon,
don't you?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.997
Does he know
who he's talking to?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.466
It says right here
that promotional seating

14:59.499 --> 15:02.135
is subject to the manager's
discretion.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.604
I am the manager;
it's my discretion.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.607
So are you telling us
that we can't sit down?

15:09.009 --> 15:10.410
You-You can sit down.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.379
Just can't sit
at the same table.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.413
What?

15:16.183 --> 15:17.550
This is so nice.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.087
I wonder what
Slaver Slav would order.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.454
Bet it be cheap.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.490
And fried.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.328
Nothing's cooler than
lighting a match for no reason.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.931
Do you think the kids
will be okay, baby?

15:35.435 --> 15:36.669
They'll be fine.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.972
Meanwhile, back at
the Diff'rent Strokes table...

15:39.006 --> 15:40.140
This is so cool.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.408
Thanks for letting us
sit with you guys.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.575
No problem at all.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.077
You're our guests,

15:44.111 --> 15:45.445
so feel free
to order anything you want.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.379
For real?

15:46.413 --> 15:47.547
For real.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.319
Meanwhile, I had started acting
like a bad boy for Tasha,

15:52.352 --> 15:54.354
but ended up being a jerk
to everybody.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.555
Can I take your order?

15:55.588 --> 15:57.757
Bus' it.
We get some French fries?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.759
We don't have French fries.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.162
Y'all call yourself
a French restaurant.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.531
All right, what y'all got?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.333
Uh, have you had a chance
to look at the menu?

16:06.366 --> 16:07.400
Nah.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.568
Y'all got some fish?

16:08.601 --> 16:09.536
We have several types.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.638
All right, well,
fry some of that up for me,

16:11.671 --> 16:13.506
get us some drinks,
some salad with French dressing

16:13.540 --> 16:15.008
some of them escargots,

16:15.042 --> 16:17.310
some French onion soup,
some French toast,

16:17.344 --> 16:19.512
and for dessert,
some French vanilla ice cream.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.613
Anything else?

16:20.647 --> 16:23.550
Y'all got French mustard?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.118
I'll check.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.287
Check on then.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.290
(French instrumental
music playing)

16:32.059 --> 16:34.261
You want one?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.200
Excuse me?

16:42.369 --> 16:44.337
That's the French version
of black

16:45.538 --> 16:46.673
So, what are you
having, baby?

16:46.706 --> 16:49.209
I'm about to have a fit.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.178
Hey! Hey! Hey!

16:55.182 --> 16:57.450
May I help you?

16:57.484 --> 16:58.685
Do you see us sitting here?

16:58.718 --> 17:01.288
I'm not understanding
the question.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.457
Look, man, we just want to have
our dinner and get out of here.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.059
Could you please take our order?

17:06.093 --> 17:07.827
Yes. What would you like?

17:07.860 --> 17:10.430
Oh, yes. Okay, um, I was
looking at this item

17:10.463 --> 17:11.664
right here.
Excuse me.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.201
See that.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.337
Is there something wrong?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.172
Yes. They gave you
the wrong menus.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.340
These

17:20.373 --> 17:22.509
are the Employee
of the Month menus.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.377
What?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.546
There's only
three things on here.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.348
Yes, and we're out
of the chicken.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.083
What?

17:30.117 --> 17:31.551
Take your time.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.255
But I wanted the chicken.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.623
Wow.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.225
I've never had
coq au vin before.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.693
You two have such
great manners.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.462
Your mother must be very proud.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.197
Well, she said
if we didn't act right,

17:44.231 --> 17:45.532
she'd slap the caviar out of us.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.234
Oh.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.569
BÃ©arnaise, anyone?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.841
I don't think you're supposed
to have your feet on the table.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.544
Ain't nobody ask you.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.347
Young man, I'm going
to have to ask you

18:00.380 --> 18:02.449
to take your feet off the table.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.783
What if I don't feel like it?

18:03.816 --> 18:06.486
Then I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.159
What if I don't feel
like doing that either?

18:12.192 --> 18:15.828
You're with the Employee
of the Month, aren't you?

18:19.566 --> 18:22.202
What is going on over there?

18:23.236 --> 18:25.438
Is that Chris?

18:25.472 --> 18:28.341
What?

18:28.375 --> 18:33.913
* Everybody plays the fool
sometime *

18:33.946 --> 18:37.517
* There's no exception
to the rule *

18:37.550 --> 18:39.719
* Listen, baby

18:39.752 --> 18:43.556
* It may be factual,
may be cruel *

18:43.590 --> 18:45.592
* I ain't lying

18:45.625 --> 18:47.794
* Everybody plays a fool...

18:47.827 --> 18:49.629
Chris!

18:49.662 --> 18:51.631
What?!

18:55.702 --> 18:57.170
(rhythmic beeping,
air whooshing)

18:57.204 --> 18:58.638
ROCHELLE:
Hey, baby.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.273
Ma?

19:00.307 --> 19:02.275
How's everything going
in here?

19:02.309 --> 19:04.811
Oh, Doctor,
is he going to be okay?

19:04.844 --> 19:06.646
Well, I think we'll be able
to get it out,

19:06.679 --> 19:08.281
but you won't be able
to wear that shoe again.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.382
Hang in there, big guy.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.684
WOMAN :
Any available IC nurse, 609.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.652
Any available...

19:12.685 --> 19:13.853
How you feeling, sweetie?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.555
Not too good.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.625
:
Well, why were you
acting like that?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.328
Just trying to
impress Tasha.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.331
By acting like an idiot?

19:24.364 --> 19:27.600
No. She said she liked bad boys,
like Slaver Slav.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.702
Trying to act like him.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.903
Without the money.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.440
Baby, you can only be
who you are.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.908
If she doesn't want you,
then you don't want her.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.578
That day I learned the most
important lesson in life:

19:38.611 --> 19:41.281
be yourself,
or get a pump in your ass.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.383
Mommy's gonna get you
some ice chips, okay?

19:43.416 --> 19:45.352
Better get a shoehorn, too.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.919
Dr. Anthony to the...

19:46.953 --> 19:48.555
Hi, sweetie.
Hi.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.923
Hey, Chris.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.426
Tasha?

19:53.460 --> 19:55.395
Yeah. Are you okay?

19:55.428 --> 19:57.897
Yeah, I'll be fine.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.734
I just wanted to apologize
for acting like such an idiot.

20:01.768 --> 20:02.969
Forgive me?

20:03.002 --> 20:04.671
Yeah, it's okay.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.539
That's what friends are for.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.341
Thanks, Dionne Warwick.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.710
Is this your x

20:10.743 --> 20:12.412
Yeah.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.747
:
Boy, you so crazy.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.750
Crazy like a boy
with a shoe up his butt.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.688
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.525
