WEBVTT

00:03.233 --> 00:04.567
Previously on
"Hit the Floor"...

00:04.633 --> 00:06.967
The winner
of the All-Star vote...

00:07.033 --> 00:10.200
Ahsha Hayes!

00:10.267 --> 00:12.267
This world is sucking you in.

00:12.333 --> 00:13.467
Derek's just a part of it.

00:13.533 --> 00:15.000
What is that?

00:15.067 --> 00:16.400
I'll explain later, I promise.

00:16.467 --> 00:18.200
Ma'am, step out of the car.

00:18.267 --> 00:21.033
German's my go-to because he
didn't throw coke in my purse.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.333
I-- I let her go
too easy.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.533
I wanna fight for her.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.733
Seconds left to score.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.233
Derek passes to Terrence.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.600
Terrence with a nice move!
Scores!

00:27.667 --> 00:29.500
He scores!
He put them in overtime!

00:29.567 --> 00:31.133
Terrence Wall is down.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.333
You took them into overtime.
You won.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.100
He's going for the win himself!

00:35.167 --> 00:36.533
Derek wins for The Devils!

00:36.600 --> 00:38.300
Thanks to Terrence's injury,

00:38.367 --> 00:40.367
there may be a new king
on the throne.

00:40.433 --> 00:42.900
If you thought confessing
your secret gay life

00:42.967 --> 00:44.300
was going to bond us--
Dad!

00:44.367 --> 00:45.500
I don't have a son.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.500
Gideon, that's my name.

00:47.567 --> 00:51.800
I would love to take Gideon
on a date to a public place.

00:51.867 --> 00:54.133
If you want that,
give me a call sometime.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.567
I came into this country
illegally.

00:56.633 --> 00:59.100
If anyone found out,
I could be deported.

00:59.167 --> 01:00.800
Will you marry me?
What?

01:00.867 --> 01:02.200
It would solve your problem,
wouldn't it?

01:02.267 --> 01:03.533
I do.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.967
His daddy runs
a movie studio.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.767
Yes!

01:08.833 --> 01:12.133
That evidence proved Oscar
had Mia killed.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.833
Who did you give it to?!

01:13.900 --> 01:16.300
Do you know what you're
getting yourself into?
I do.

01:16.367 --> 01:20.333
Oscar Kinkade,
you're under arrest for
the murder of Mia Sertner.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.267
You have no idea
what you've done.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.533
I know Jelena gave you
that evidence.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.233
There was something
in it for her.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.367
Ahsha, I'm sorry.

01:28.433 --> 01:29.767
You're fired.

01:29.833 --> 01:30.967
Olivia.

01:31.067 --> 01:32.433
If I didn't kill Olivia

01:32.500 --> 01:35.667
and you didn't
kill Olivia, who did?

01:35.733 --> 01:38.733
Can you imagine getting away
with murder?

03:07.067 --> 03:08.867
So you were a Devil girl?
Thank you.

03:08.933 --> 03:10.500
Miss...
Ahsha Hayes.

03:10.567 --> 03:12.233
We'll let you know.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.367
How did it go?

03:27.433 --> 03:29.233
You book the commercial?

03:29.300 --> 03:30.667
Fingers crossed.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.967
You nailed it.

03:48.733 --> 03:51.533
Do you boys ever wear shirts?

03:51.600 --> 03:52.967
Not that I'm complaining.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.767
Lionel, hey.

03:54.833 --> 03:56.400
Derek, what do you think
of your new banner?

03:56.467 --> 03:57.933
It's dope.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.700
Did you get the motorcycle
I had sent over?

03:59.767 --> 04:01.900
The black-and-red
Devils logo.

04:01.967 --> 04:03.933
Just wanna make sure you're
feeling properly fawned over

04:04.067 --> 04:05.333
before you sign
your new deal.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.067
And where's my motorcycle?

04:07.067 --> 04:09.333
You don't want one.
They're death traps.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.567
I cheat death.

04:10.633 --> 04:12.800
By the way, I'm ahead
of my recovery schedule.

04:12.867 --> 04:14.800
I have a meeting
I need to get to.

04:14.867 --> 04:17.700
Derek, wear a helmet.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.400
Thanks for coming, Sloane.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.333
So nice to see you.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.900
You're not that good
of an actress.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.667
Yeah, I phoned
that one in.

04:33.733 --> 04:35.200
We have a title.

04:35.267 --> 04:37.767
We also have a big, white,
pudgy pall hanging over us

04:37.833 --> 04:40.500
in the form of an owner
awaiting trial for murder,
thanks to you.

04:40.567 --> 04:42.267
I have tryouts
I should be at.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.267
I hope he hangs.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.533
Or at least works the prison
runway in an orange jumpsuit

04:46.600 --> 04:48.200
for the rest of his life.

04:48.267 --> 04:49.767
I have every faith

04:49.833 --> 04:52.167
that as lead witness
in the case against him,

04:52.233 --> 04:54.300
you'll ensure
he does just that.

04:54.367 --> 04:56.400
I'm branding myself
as team owner.

04:56.467 --> 05:00.067
The taste-great,
less-murderess Kinkade.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.100
Say anything
to tarnish that image

05:02.167 --> 05:04.667
and there will be hell
to pay.

05:04.733 --> 05:07.200
I'm not afraid of Oscar.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.633
What makes you think
I'm afraid of you?

05:09.700 --> 05:13.067
I don't need you
to be afraid.

05:13.133 --> 05:16.400
I need you to be smart.

05:16.467 --> 05:19.067
I'll let you get back
to your spirit fingers.

05:26.867 --> 05:28.733
Four months.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.200
Look how far
you've come, babe.

05:32.267 --> 05:35.867
Strength, stability,
function.

05:35.933 --> 05:38.067
You'll have
symmetry in no time.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.167
You'll be back on the court,
calling the shots.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.133
I'll be calling them
from the front office

05:43.200 --> 05:45.267
thanks to putting Lionel
in Oscar's chair.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.467
Lionel.

05:46.533 --> 05:47.900
What?

05:47.967 --> 05:49.533
I saw her today.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.367
I did not like the vibe
I got from her.

05:51.433 --> 05:53.700
You shouldn't think
negatively, Terrence.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.233
You're a hero.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.167
Everyone knows it.

05:58.833 --> 06:01.900
It's just so hard, baby.

06:01.967 --> 06:04.933
I feel so... broken.

06:05.067 --> 06:09.433
Terrence Wall...

06:09.500 --> 06:12.333
you are far from broken.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.633
And I'm going to
prove it to you.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.067
Mmm, be gentle.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.367
Oh, no, no, trust me,
there's not going to be

06:18.433 --> 06:21.200
anything gentle about this.
Mm-hmm.

06:30.167 --> 06:33.200
Nice, Zero, that's awesome.
That's perfect.

06:35.567 --> 06:36.700
This way.

06:36.767 --> 06:39.067
Take five.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.700
Jude, glad you came.

06:41.767 --> 06:44.167
Yeah... I'd hate
to have missed this.

06:44.233 --> 06:47.067
Ah, two titles
and suddenly sin is in.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.967
I got a beer campaign
tomorrow,

06:49.067 --> 06:50.300
Trojan commercial
in the afternoon,

06:50.367 --> 06:52.933
and this is my
new underwear line.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.767
What do you think?

06:54.833 --> 06:57.867
Can't help but notice there
are only girls in the picture.

06:57.933 --> 07:00.100
I'm all the man
it needs.

07:00.167 --> 07:02.300
Looks like you're killing it.
Congrats.

07:02.367 --> 07:04.600
We could be
killing it together.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.067
That's why I
called you here.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.833
I want you to be
my agent again.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.467
Help me rake in
all this cash.

07:09.533 --> 07:11.367
I know what you want.

07:11.433 --> 07:14.667
It's business, Jude.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.400
Unless you don't think you
can keep it just business.

07:18.967 --> 07:21.733
I'm making more money
than ever.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.967
This would be
huge for you.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.133
You should have them
put more bronzer on you.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.067
There's only so much
Photoshop can do.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.100
You didn't say no.

07:37.167 --> 07:39.267
I didn't say yes, either.

07:47.533 --> 07:48.667
Ugh!

07:48.733 --> 07:49.933
Hey, Care Bear.

07:50.067 --> 07:52.067
How was your day?
Better than yours.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.267
What do you mean?

07:53.333 --> 07:54.567
Miguel got
in the toy closet.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.667
He's a five-year-old boy,
it happens.

07:56.733 --> 07:59.433
Not his, yours.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.267
That was organized
and color-coded!

08:02.333 --> 08:03.433
Uhh!

08:03.500 --> 08:05.500
I am traumatized.
You're traumatized?

08:05.567 --> 08:07.867
I spent ten minutes
convincing him those beads

08:07.933 --> 08:09.900
were a Christmas decoration.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.433
I asked you to put a lock
on that thing.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.833
I asked you to do
the same with him,

08:14.900 --> 08:16.067
but he's still
on the loose.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.733
Maybe I
should go.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.200
Sit right there.

08:19.267 --> 08:20.900
You know, it's stressful
enough Devil Girls

08:20.967 --> 08:22.267
have to re-audition
every year,

08:22.333 --> 08:23.933
to have to come home
to a nagging wife--

08:24.067 --> 08:25.700
You're right.
I'm sorry.

08:25.767 --> 08:27.833
You're risking a lot
to help me get citizenship.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.700
It's just I'm looking out
for Miguel.

08:29.767 --> 08:30.967
We're packed
into this apartment.

08:31.067 --> 08:32.367
I'm just stressed.

08:32.433 --> 08:35.233
Apology accepted.
Thank you.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.867
Where's dinner?
"Where's dinner?"

08:41.933 --> 08:43.367
Kyle, I have a job,
too, you know.

08:43.433 --> 08:44.900
And I've been dancing
all day, I am hungry.

08:44.967 --> 08:48.967
And I had to pick up
Miguel from daycare!
Here we go.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.067
I've been waiting
all day for this.

08:51.100 --> 08:54.067
Ohh!
Less of this...

08:54.067 --> 08:55.667
and more of...

08:56.967 --> 08:58.300
...that.

08:58.367 --> 08:59.667
Okay.

08:59.733 --> 09:00.933
Mm...

09:02.933 --> 09:04.067
Oh, come on!

09:05.633 --> 09:06.767
Hey.

09:06.833 --> 09:08.067
Don't you knock?

09:08.100 --> 09:10.467
Why would I think my mom
was getting freaky?

09:10.533 --> 09:12.200
Why would you
think she wasn't?

09:12.267 --> 09:14.133
Okay, from now on, we're
only doing it at my place,

09:14.200 --> 09:16.333
where you will
never have a key.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.533
Mm...

09:17.600 --> 09:19.133
Talk to your mom.

09:21.333 --> 09:25.600
Can we just pretend
he didn't say "doing it"?

09:25.667 --> 09:26.800
I'd like that, yes.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.400
Okay.

09:30.767 --> 09:34.067
So... how are
tryouts going?

09:34.133 --> 09:36.200
The girls miss you.

09:36.267 --> 09:37.700
You know, just because
you can't audition

09:37.767 --> 09:39.867
doesn't mean you're not
welcome in the arena.

09:39.933 --> 09:43.133
Am I welcome at home?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.533
Mom, Kyle's place
is a clown car.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.333
If Immigration pops by,
they're gonna wonder who

09:47.400 --> 09:49.400
the random black girl is
sleeping on the couch.

09:49.467 --> 09:51.067
I feel like
I'm in the way.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.833
I'm sure you're not.
They probably love--

09:52.900 --> 09:54.133
Mm-mm, I need
to get out of there.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.400
It's a crime scene
waiting to happen.

09:56.467 --> 09:58.300
And, well...

10:00.800 --> 10:03.267
I can't think of anywhere else
I'd rather be than here.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.700
You put me through hell,
and I put you through hell,

10:07.767 --> 10:11.367
and, well,
I just miss you.

10:11.433 --> 10:14.000
And with Oscar's
trial coming up,

10:14.067 --> 10:17.167
I thought
you might need me.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.667
I would love you
to move back.

10:20.733 --> 10:22.700
Thank you, God.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.133
Lionel?

10:28.200 --> 10:29.633
Hello, Jelena.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.233
I have some things
I need you to take care of,

10:31.300 --> 10:32.733
starting with marketing
for the new season.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.700
I'm tying the ring ceremony
into the dance,

10:34.767 --> 10:36.800
banging the victory drum
as loud as possible.

10:36.867 --> 10:39.167
The Devils need the spotlight,
not scandal.

10:39.233 --> 10:42.233
So we're gonna push the boys
as strong, inspirational.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.033
Obviously Terrence
front and center.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.567
Hmm.

10:45.633 --> 10:48.400
I think that would be
sending the wrong message.

10:48.467 --> 10:49.967
And what message is that?

10:50.033 --> 10:52.667
That Terrence will be
front and center.

10:52.733 --> 10:55.567
Well, not right away,
but once rehab--

10:55.633 --> 10:57.100
I mean ever.

10:57.167 --> 10:59.033
Even if Terrence
got back on court,

10:59.100 --> 11:00.867
he'll never be
the player he was.

11:00.933 --> 11:03.333
Sure, we're selling twice
as many of his jerseys now,

11:03.400 --> 11:07.100
and... maybe if we're 30 points
ahead, I'll let him go for--

11:07.167 --> 11:08.500
You'll let him?

11:08.567 --> 11:12.067
The organization can't
risk him taking another fall.

11:12.133 --> 11:13.267
The first one was heroic,

11:13.333 --> 11:15.733
but the second
would just be sad.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.467
I'm sorry, let's try this
conversation again.

11:19.533 --> 11:22.600
You put me in this seat,
but I'm not your puppet.

11:22.667 --> 11:23.733
I'm the boss.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.067
You're what
I tell you you are.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.967
I got rid
of Ahsha for you.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.767
I think we're square.

11:37.733 --> 11:40.300
Okay, ladies,
it's final round today.

11:58.867 --> 12:00.800
Let's take a break.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.967
After that,
we'll finish up solos,

12:03.067 --> 12:05.233
then move on
to the final round.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.267
It's so good having you
back, Peyton.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.467
Once a Devil Girl,
always a Devil Girl.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.933
Lionel is talking about
not playing Terrence...

12:17.067 --> 12:19.067
ever again.

12:19.133 --> 12:20.600
Pete is going
to have to intervene.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.100
She's out of control.

12:23.167 --> 12:25.567
You mean
out of your control.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.467
Hey.

12:37.533 --> 12:39.567
I was
looking for Pete.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.167
He's in a meeting.

12:41.233 --> 12:43.233
Yeah, well,
I came to--

12:43.300 --> 12:45.200
I came to bring him
one of these.

12:45.267 --> 12:46.600
Lionel gave them to me.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.200
Thought he might wanna
share a victory puff,

12:48.267 --> 12:50.133
you know, before
things got too crazy.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.400
You want one?

12:51.467 --> 12:54.933
Ah, figured
you earned it, too.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.400
Sure.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.467
Nice.

13:02.533 --> 13:03.933
Haven't seen you
in a few months.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.667
How ya been?

13:05.733 --> 13:07.067
Good.

13:07.067 --> 13:08.467
How's Ahsha?

13:13.567 --> 13:14.700
Good.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.633
Haven't seen her
around tryouts.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.333
She's not coming back.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.267
At all?

13:29.667 --> 13:31.600
She's moved on.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.500
I'm gonna kill her.
The ball and chain?

13:46.567 --> 13:47.700
No, Lionel!

13:47.767 --> 13:49.500
She thinks just because
she spent some money

13:49.567 --> 13:52.067
to upgrade the place she can
tell me how to run it.

13:52.067 --> 13:54.867
If she called me Rachel
one more time,

13:54.933 --> 13:56.067
I was gonna slug her.

13:56.133 --> 13:57.767
I'd pay to see that,
actually.

13:57.833 --> 14:00.367
What'd she do to you?

14:00.433 --> 14:02.067
Let's just say she's not

14:02.133 --> 14:04.867
one of my favorite people
right now.

14:04.933 --> 14:06.867
How are tryouts going?

14:06.933 --> 14:08.767
Any new standouts?

14:08.833 --> 14:10.767
Someone's interested.

14:10.833 --> 14:14.333
It's exciting...
for you.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.733
Why don't you try out?

14:20.267 --> 14:21.600
You weren't kidding?

14:21.667 --> 14:22.733
Open call is over,

14:22.800 --> 14:24.467
but I could get you
into the next round.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.233
Kind of ironic, no?

14:28.300 --> 14:29.567
You asking me
to audition again,

14:29.633 --> 14:32.067
considering you helped
get me cut to begin with.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.633
You're saying
a lot of words.

14:33.700 --> 14:34.833
Are you in or out?

14:34.900 --> 14:37.267
I'm flattered,
but those days are behind me.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.567
I need to get
back to work.

14:38.633 --> 14:41.100
Text me if you wind up
decking anyone.

14:51.367 --> 14:53.133
I have a badge.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.367
It's deactivated.

14:54.433 --> 14:56.100
Okay, I don't
work here anymore,

14:56.167 --> 14:57.633
but I was told to come
get my stuff.

14:57.700 --> 15:01.267
If you don't have an active
badge, I can't help you.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.067
My entire family
works here-- literally!

15:04.100 --> 15:06.067
Sorry.

15:06.133 --> 15:08.500
It's okay...
I called her.

15:08.567 --> 15:10.400
She's a former Devil Girl.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.533
Don't worry,
she won't be long.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.133
Sorry I can't chat.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.200
I'm so busy
with auditions.

15:19.267 --> 15:21.267
Such a strong crop
this year.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.667
Hopefully no one
too strong.

15:23.733 --> 15:28.067
All that time away and you're
still hanging on to that ego.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.400
Take care.

15:48.467 --> 15:49.700
So when is she moving in?

15:49.767 --> 15:51.733
Oh, she already
brought over boxes.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.733
Sloane Hayes.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.733
Can I help you?

15:58.800 --> 16:00.067
Adam Oberman,

16:00.100 --> 16:02.967
deputy commissioner
of the league.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.467
What do you want?

16:04.533 --> 16:06.800
Well, I wanted
to introduce myself

16:06.867 --> 16:09.067
and to tell you that
the league is in your debt

16:09.067 --> 16:10.200
for what you've done
with Oscar,

16:10.267 --> 16:11.467
putting him behind bars.

16:11.533 --> 16:12.667
You have
our full support.

16:12.733 --> 16:14.433
Don't question that
for a moment.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.367
The only thing I'm not
questioning is your timing.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.133
Oscar's trial is coming up

16:18.200 --> 16:19.667
and you're afraid
of what I might say.

16:19.733 --> 16:21.967
Maybe you think I'll tell
the world you abandoned me

16:22.067 --> 16:23.867
and my investigation
when it got too hot.

16:23.933 --> 16:26.467
They didn't just abandon you,
they tried to get you to stop.

16:26.533 --> 16:28.300
That was an old regime
that has been replaced.

16:28.367 --> 16:29.633
I'm here to make amends.

16:29.700 --> 16:32.600
The fact is what you did
was an amazing thing.

16:32.667 --> 16:36.133
You are clearly the moral center
of this organization.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.767
You don't care
about moral centers.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.700
You're trying
to spin this so it

16:39.767 --> 16:41.400
doesn't look
like you condoned

16:41.467 --> 16:43.867
having killers and thieves
in your organization.

16:43.933 --> 16:45.933
You're not gonna
use me to do that.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.300
You heard her.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.900
My card.

16:54.967 --> 16:56.300
My door.

17:04.333 --> 17:05.567
Ladies...

17:05.633 --> 17:07.533
these are the battles.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.233
Vets vs. newbies.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.467
You're going up against
the best of--

17:16.067 --> 17:17.433
Raquel.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.667
Hope I'm not too late.

17:28.133 --> 17:32.067
Okay, ladies, when Jelena
calls your name, you're up.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.367
Maggie.

17:33.433 --> 17:34.767
Stephanie.

17:34.833 --> 17:35.967
Come on, ladies!

17:45.667 --> 17:48.067
Peyton...
Desiree.

17:49.867 --> 17:51.233
Go, Desiree!

18:01.733 --> 18:04.933
Marybeth... Raquel.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.367
You can do it,
Raquel!

18:32.467 --> 18:34.300
Whoo!
Still got it!

18:45.600 --> 18:47.367
Hey, you.

18:47.433 --> 18:49.067
Hey.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.633
I, uh...

18:50.700 --> 18:52.133
I didn't hear you come in.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.200
I'm a ninja.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.500
What's wrong?

19:00.567 --> 19:02.067
Nothing.

19:02.067 --> 19:04.433
I heard back on that
commercial audition.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.967
I didn't get it.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.233
I'm sorry, babe.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.600
They wanted a girl
with a different look.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.067
It happens.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.500
Whoa, babe, obviously...

19:12.567 --> 19:16.067
they wanted some...
broke-down troll

19:16.100 --> 19:19.100
because you are the most
beautiful woman

19:19.167 --> 19:22.500
that they could've ever even
hoped to get their hands on.

19:22.567 --> 19:24.100
Mm-hmm.

19:24.167 --> 19:26.533
Stop!

19:26.600 --> 19:28.100
You sure
you want me to stop?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.767
Uh-uh.

19:38.733 --> 19:40.433
Coach, you got a sec?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.433
Yeah, come on in.
How you feeling?

19:42.500 --> 19:44.400
I didn't come here
for a shoulder.

19:44.467 --> 19:46.800
I need real talk.

19:46.867 --> 19:48.500
Take a seat.

19:52.167 --> 19:54.367
Rumor has it your
ex-wife isn't looking

19:54.433 --> 19:55.967
to play me again
as a starter.

19:56.067 --> 19:57.167
Ever.

19:57.233 --> 20:00.267
It's not up to Lionel
how I play my roster.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.300
Well, what if she drops me
from the roster?

20:03.367 --> 20:05.333
I don't think
she'd do that.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.833
You don't think.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.733
You have
to talk to her.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.467
That might do
more harm than good.

20:13.533 --> 20:16.300
How much worse
could it get?

20:16.367 --> 20:17.600
We just won a title!

20:17.667 --> 20:20.167
And she could
get rid of us all.

20:28.867 --> 20:30.133
Pete?

20:30.200 --> 20:33.800
I thought Lionel running things
would be bad for me.

20:33.867 --> 20:35.933
She could ruin
the whole organization.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.467
There's not a damn thing that
anybody can do to stop her.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.533
Two world championships.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.633
I really don't see
a better fit for the game.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.967
Hell yeah, I'd make
a great team captain.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.400
You will
never be captain.

20:53.467 --> 20:54.733
Later.

20:54.800 --> 20:59.000
The slot's open,
since it won't be you.

20:59.067 --> 21:01.633
You actually have to be
on the court to get the gig.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.833
The reason you
will never be captain

21:03.900 --> 21:07.400
is because I would burn
this arena to the ground

21:07.467 --> 21:09.067
before that
could ever happen.

21:17.067 --> 21:20.500
"Zero, everything your
mother warned you about."

21:20.567 --> 21:23.267
Well, your mother
and the CDC.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.800
What's up?
The ring ceremony
is days away.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.167
Derek's deal
will be done by then.

21:28.233 --> 21:30.233
I think you should
make a big show of it--

21:30.300 --> 21:31.433
for him, for the crowd.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.800
I don't work
for Derek anymore.

21:33.867 --> 21:35.300
We're not even friends.

21:35.367 --> 21:37.133
Unless... "Drown, bitch"

21:37.200 --> 21:40.667
is a term of endearment.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.400
You wouldn't be
working for Derek.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.567
You'd be working for me.

21:44.633 --> 21:45.933
For you?

21:46.067 --> 21:47.967
Executive Vice President
of Business Operations

21:48.067 --> 21:50.300
for the Los Angeles Devils.

21:50.367 --> 21:52.067
How's it sound?

21:52.100 --> 21:55.133
The job's been vacant
since Chase Vincent left.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.200
You've always wanted to be
a part of the Kinkade dynasty.

21:58.267 --> 21:59.400
Here's your chance.

22:00.733 --> 22:02.967
Lionel, I...

22:03.067 --> 22:04.433
Thank you.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.900
Great.

22:05.967 --> 22:09.100
Well... there's
this other offer.

22:11.567 --> 22:12.700
Other offer?

22:12.767 --> 22:14.267
Just this thing.

22:15.533 --> 22:16.867
Can I think about it?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.333
Sure.

22:26.133 --> 22:27.800
But tick-tock.

22:40.633 --> 22:42.533
Sloane.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.933
You want me
on your side?

22:44.067 --> 22:45.067
Yes.

22:45.133 --> 22:46.767
Well, I thought
of something you can do.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.967
Not just for me,
for everyone.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.067
What?

22:50.067 --> 22:51.267
The league obviously knows

22:51.333 --> 22:52.667
what they have
on their hands in L.A.

22:52.733 --> 22:53.900
I want you
to get off your asses

22:53.967 --> 22:56.533
and do something about it.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.100
What do you
want us to do?

22:58.167 --> 23:00.967
When an owner is bad
for business,

23:01.067 --> 23:03.500
the league
can make a change.

23:03.567 --> 23:05.367
I want you to force a sale

23:05.433 --> 23:09.067
and get the Kinkades out of
Devils Arena once and for all.

23:17.267 --> 23:18.633
Jelena.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.167
I got you into tryouts,
and you didn't even bother

23:20.233 --> 23:22.300
to show up when we
announced the new team?

23:22.367 --> 23:24.200
Not getting
asked back last year

23:24.267 --> 23:26.067
was one of the most painful
moments of my life.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.733
I couldn't
go through it again.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.067
You saw my audition.

23:29.133 --> 23:30.900
I haven't danced since then,
and it was obvious.

23:30.967 --> 23:32.833
And if you say it wasn't,
you're a liar.

23:32.900 --> 23:35.633
It was obvious.
Your fouettés were sloppy.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.867
Your flexibility isn't anywhere
near where it used to be.

23:37.933 --> 23:39.400
And your
conditioning is a joke.

23:39.467 --> 23:41.067
But not showing up?

23:41.133 --> 23:43.533
How disrespectful
is that to me?

23:45.533 --> 23:46.867
I'm sorry.

23:48.167 --> 23:49.933
You're not just going
to apologize to me.

23:50.067 --> 23:51.300
You're going to apologize

23:51.367 --> 23:54.333
to the rest of your
fellow Devil Girls.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.800
The rest of my...

24:00.433 --> 24:01.800
Jelena, I--

24:01.867 --> 24:04.467
Please don't
make this a moment.

24:04.533 --> 24:07.467
Are you making up for your guilt
for cutting me last season?

24:07.533 --> 24:08.967
I don't make
business decisions

24:09.067 --> 24:10.833
for emotional reasons.

24:10.900 --> 24:14.267
I meant everything
I said, but...

24:14.333 --> 24:16.333
but you're
a beautiful dancer.

24:20.067 --> 24:22.567
Welcome back to
the Devil Girls, Raquel.

24:28.933 --> 24:30.867
We're back, bitches!

24:33.833 --> 24:35.167
Welcome back.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.233
I made it.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.700
You made it?

24:39.767 --> 24:42.267
Congratulations.
That's amazing.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.567
Are you okay?

24:46.633 --> 24:47.933
Of course.

24:48.067 --> 24:49.633
I mean, we live
together and--

24:49.700 --> 24:53.733
and now we have...
side-by-side lockers.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.867
What could be better?

24:55.933 --> 24:57.267
Right?

25:02.567 --> 25:06.667
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

25:06.733 --> 25:11.667
for your world champion
Los Angeles Devils!

25:17.867 --> 25:21.067
Your very own luxury box.

25:21.067 --> 25:22.467
I like what you've
done with the place.

25:22.533 --> 25:24.467
Ah, it was
your credit card.

25:24.533 --> 25:26.367
Oh, I know.

25:29.733 --> 25:32.667
Look at the love you're
getting on the Jumbotron.

25:32.733 --> 25:34.600
Fans are eating it up.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.767
You're worth it,
of course.

25:36.833 --> 25:38.333
And I appreciate it.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.700
All of it.

25:39.767 --> 25:41.400
Unfortunately...

25:41.467 --> 25:44.067
I'm not signing
a new contract.

25:45.067 --> 25:46.367
What?

25:46.433 --> 25:48.267
I am Derek Roman.

25:48.333 --> 25:50.267
I need a deal
that reflects that.

25:50.333 --> 25:53.900
I need serious
kiss-my-ass money.

25:53.967 --> 25:57.167
I need to choke
on the dollar signs.

26:12.133 --> 26:13.467
Come on,
let's go courtside.

26:13.533 --> 26:15.233
I wanna watch the dance
from the floor.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.400
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing

26:17.467 --> 26:22.700
for the very first time,
your brand-new Devil Girls!

28:09.167 --> 28:10.700
Yeah! Yeah!

28:12.200 --> 28:13.833
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:13.900 --> 28:17.600
it's now time for our
championship ring presentation

28:17.667 --> 28:22.100
and the world champion
Los Angeles Devils!

28:34.600 --> 28:35.733
Thank you.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.133
Thank you.

28:39.100 --> 28:40.633
We're all set.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.333
Brings out my eyes.
Don't you think?

28:44.867 --> 28:47.867
I can't be your agent.

28:47.933 --> 28:49.367
Why not?

28:49.433 --> 28:52.367
Lionel offered me a job
with the Devils.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.567
That's why you won't
work with me?

28:55.633 --> 28:59.233
I always wanted to be
a part of the Devils.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.500
She offered me EVP, I--

29:01.567 --> 29:03.233
I can't turn it down.

29:07.067 --> 29:09.400
EVP, that'd
make you my boss.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.500
That's hot.

29:20.367 --> 29:23.333
You got your ring.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.100
And I got
to give it to you.

29:25.167 --> 29:27.267
It's kind of
the perfect day.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.567
Ooh!

29:28.633 --> 29:31.333
Oh, God, Terrence,
Terrence... okay...

29:31.400 --> 29:32.867
It's all right, it's okay.

29:36.633 --> 29:38.667
The day could be
more perfect.

29:42.233 --> 29:46.200
Baby... we weren't
looking for love,

29:46.267 --> 29:47.600
but we found it.

29:49.133 --> 29:51.800
We dragged it
through hell and back.

29:51.867 --> 29:53.667
And it only got stronger.

29:53.733 --> 29:58.233
These last four months,
you have been by my side

29:58.300 --> 30:00.600
nursing me without
a single complaint.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.867
You made me stronger.

30:05.933 --> 30:09.000
I don't just want you.

30:09.067 --> 30:10.400
I need you.

30:19.700 --> 30:23.967
Jelena Howard...

30:24.033 --> 30:25.367
will you marry me?

30:26.733 --> 30:30.300
Yes, Terrence Wall,
I will marry you.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.033
That was a great first game.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.467
I know.

30:46.533 --> 30:47.933
There were so many
people there.

30:49.067 --> 30:50.400
I saw you up here.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.333
Watching the dance.

30:57.333 --> 31:01.400
I could tell you missed it,
being out there.

31:01.467 --> 31:04.333
I'm surprised you
didn't fight to come back.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.067
Fight? What are
you talking about?

31:06.067 --> 31:09.333
No, whatever happened.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.733
I-- I don't believe
in a million years

31:12.800 --> 31:14.333
you'd ever quit
the Devil Girls.

31:20.267 --> 31:23.267
I'm fighting
for what I want.

31:23.333 --> 31:24.967
You talking
about your deal?

31:25.067 --> 31:27.333
I'm talking about you.

31:31.067 --> 31:32.800
I heard something
about you fighting for me

31:32.867 --> 31:34.800
from my mom
a few months ago.

31:34.867 --> 31:36.733
Assumed you heard
I was back with German

31:36.800 --> 31:38.900
and decided to give me
my space instead?

31:38.967 --> 31:40.267
No...

31:40.333 --> 31:42.400
I'm not giving
you your space.

31:43.433 --> 31:46.200
I've been
cleaning house.

31:46.267 --> 31:48.067
I cut ties with my mom.

31:48.067 --> 31:49.433
The hangers-on,
the coke.

31:55.300 --> 31:56.833
I haven't
stopped loving you.

31:58.433 --> 32:01.600
I'll never stop loving you.

32:03.567 --> 32:05.167
Love was never
our problem.

32:05.233 --> 32:07.433
I'm building a kingdom.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.733
So,
when you're ready...

32:09.800 --> 32:12.933
you can walk in and sit
on the throne beside me.

32:33.133 --> 32:34.967
Hey, champion.

32:39.933 --> 32:42.067
He didn't sign.

32:42.133 --> 32:44.233
He's holding out
for more money.

32:44.300 --> 32:47.067
He's already started
negotiating with the Devils.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.533
Contractually,
he can't go anywhere else.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.067
We'll lock him up.

32:51.067 --> 32:52.667
"We'll"?

32:52.733 --> 32:55.233
I'm accepting the EVP job.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.200
To the Kinkades.

33:03.267 --> 33:05.867
Long may we reign.

33:08.067 --> 33:09.667
Boom, huh?

33:11.367 --> 33:13.933
Looks good.
It looks so good.

33:14.067 --> 33:16.133
Everything
is almost perfect.

33:16.200 --> 33:20.333
It's because of me
Lionel's in this arena.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.233
Hmm... well,
she might not be

33:22.300 --> 33:23.733
sticking around
as long as you think.

33:25.367 --> 33:27.967
If it's a fight she wants,

33:28.067 --> 33:29.667
it's a fight
she's gonna get.

33:41.267 --> 33:44.733
The adrenaline!
Oh, my God, I missed that.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.933
You were amazing.
You were amazing.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.567
We were amazing.

33:49.633 --> 33:52.267
I'm afraid I'm gonna cut
your throat while you sleep.

33:52.333 --> 33:55.200
I'm afraid I'm gonna do it
when you're wide awake.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.867
We can get through this.

33:56.933 --> 33:58.067
We can.

33:58.133 --> 34:00.467
We just have to...
breathe deep.

34:00.533 --> 34:03.667
Do a lot of yoga and just keep
things as calm as possible.

34:03.733 --> 34:04.933
Maybe drugs.

34:05.067 --> 34:06.667
Maybe drugs.

34:13.067 --> 34:14.600
Hi! Baby.

34:14.667 --> 34:16.400
Teddy! What are
you doing here?

34:16.467 --> 34:19.233
Wanted to share
the good news in person.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.067
I set up the project.

34:22.067 --> 34:23.367
What project?

34:23.433 --> 34:24.900
Your life story.

34:24.967 --> 34:26.767
"Fifty Shades of Kyle."
It's gonna be made into a movie.

34:28.533 --> 34:29.700
My life's being made
into a--

34:29.767 --> 34:31.733
I gotta jam,
there's so much to do.

34:31.800 --> 34:32.933
I'll call you.

34:35.467 --> 34:37.633
You're gonna be famous.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.933
Uh...

34:44.233 --> 34:46.967
Lionel, you hear
that applause for me in there?

34:47.067 --> 34:48.300
Fans love you.

34:48.367 --> 34:50.433
Yeah, just
so we're clear.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.133
Just so we're clear--

34:52.200 --> 34:54.133
I don't do anything
because the fans

34:54.200 --> 34:57.733
or anyone else
tells me to.

34:57.800 --> 35:00.367
Lionel, you don't
wanna make an enemy of me.

35:00.433 --> 35:02.467
You put me in that chair

35:02.533 --> 35:05.333
because you didn't have
the guts to do it yourself.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.467
I married Oscar.

35:07.533 --> 35:09.300
You don't wanna make
an enemy of me.

35:09.367 --> 35:11.067
And I didn't
break your leg.

35:11.133 --> 35:12.433
You did.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.533
The decisions we make
have consequences.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.167
You're gonna
have to figure out

35:16.233 --> 35:17.933
a way to deal
with them.

35:31.067 --> 35:34.067
Ahsha, I know
it's gotta be hard.

35:34.100 --> 35:37.167
But you got some great things
ahead of you, baby.

35:37.233 --> 35:38.967
You're too amazing
not to.

35:39.067 --> 35:41.767
"Amazing."

35:41.833 --> 35:44.300
I didn't get that
commercial I auditioned for.

35:44.367 --> 35:45.800
You told me they
wanted a different--

35:45.867 --> 35:48.133
They didn't want
a different anything.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.533
I made that up.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.933
I didn't book it
because I didn't try.

35:54.067 --> 35:56.067
My heart wasn't in it.

35:56.067 --> 35:59.200
My heart's with
the Devil Girls.

35:59.267 --> 36:02.067
I could've fought
for a chance to try out.

36:02.100 --> 36:03.233
I didn't.

36:03.300 --> 36:04.700
Why not?

36:04.767 --> 36:07.333
Because I don't
deserve to be there.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.733
You're being
too hard on yourself.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.933
It's not that.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.833
It's karma.

36:13.900 --> 36:15.933
For stealing All-Star.

36:17.267 --> 36:19.200
I couldn't let Jelena win,
not again,

36:19.267 --> 36:21.433
not after everything
she did to me.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.567
So I asked Olivia
to fix the vote.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.500
Ahsha Hayes,
All-Star is a fraud.

36:27.567 --> 36:30.600
My entire reputation
is based on a lie.

36:34.933 --> 36:37.233
If people found out, I could
be banned from the league

36:37.300 --> 36:38.633
and be humiliated.

36:43.667 --> 36:46.533
Olivia's the only person
who knew.

36:48.767 --> 36:51.400
She took that secret
with her to the grave.

36:59.567 --> 37:01.533
You don't seem surprised.

37:04.367 --> 37:05.500
Yeah, I'm just, um...

37:07.267 --> 37:09.167
Just taking it all in.

37:19.333 --> 37:22.633
Ahsha, look...

37:22.700 --> 37:25.733
Sometimes people can
drive you to do things.

37:28.100 --> 37:31.600
Things you never thought you
could do in a million years.

37:35.067 --> 37:38.567
I've been holding on
to that for so long.

37:39.767 --> 37:41.867
It's starting
to drive me crazy.

37:47.067 --> 37:51.633
Keeping a secret
like that, German...

37:51.700 --> 37:53.867
it messes with you.

38:08.067 --> 38:09.567
Can't help but think
it's no accident

38:09.633 --> 38:12.600
you invited me to this
particular establishment.

38:12.667 --> 38:13.800
Well, we wanted you
to have the best,

38:13.867 --> 38:16.667
and Jelena's is the best.

38:16.733 --> 38:19.467
We've... heard things.

38:19.533 --> 38:21.067
We want the truth.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.800
The league sniffing
around Devils Arena,

38:23.867 --> 38:26.567
it's been a mess
for months-- why now?

38:26.633 --> 38:30.933
Uh, candidly, because
of the problems at the top.

38:31.067 --> 38:33.633
The league is beginning
the process of forcing a sale.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.800
You're right.

38:37.867 --> 38:39.300
Inviting you here
was no accident,

38:39.367 --> 38:41.600
but it wasn't
to talk problems.

38:41.667 --> 38:43.067
It was to talk solutions.

38:43.100 --> 38:45.167
What's the solution?

38:47.100 --> 38:48.767
We are.

38:48.833 --> 38:51.067
We want to buy
the Devils.

38:51.067 --> 38:54.067
And we'll do whatever
it takes to do it.

40:08.067 --> 40:10.700
Ohh. Ohh.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.600
Oh, it was just
a bad dream.

40:15.367 --> 40:16.500
Everything's fine.

40:16.567 --> 40:18.067
Everything's
not fine.

40:18.133 --> 40:20.133
German, why were you
calling out "Olivia"?

40:32.167 --> 40:33.500
Next time on "Hit The Floor"...

40:33.567 --> 40:34.867
You said "Olivia"
three times.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.600
She wanted to hurt you.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.667
The league is gearing up
to force a sale.

40:38.733 --> 40:40.467
You still haven't signed
your number one player.

40:40.533 --> 40:42.600
All this for Ahsha?

40:42.667 --> 40:44.733
We need a partner
to help us buy the team.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.267
You want me to invest
a lot of money in you,

40:46.333 --> 40:47.567
not buy you a beer.

40:47.633 --> 40:49.233
So, can we have dinner
together privately?

40:49.300 --> 40:51.833
Are you coming on to me?

40:51.900 --> 40:53.400
You shouldn't be sticking
your neck out like this.

40:53.467 --> 40:54.833
My neck
is already out there.

40:54.900 --> 40:56.567
I just want you
to be safe.

40:56.633 --> 40:58.300
Who are you and why
are you following me?

40:58.367 --> 41:00.700
You like deals.

41:00.767 --> 41:02.200
I got one for you.
