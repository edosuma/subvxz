07:11.593 --> 07:13.584
They do this in biology.

07:14.793 --> 07:16.988
You need two Os.

07:17.033 --> 07:19.501
One from each parent to be just O.

07:19.553 --> 07:24.149
O's recessive. Somebody's got lan's
blood group wrong

07:24.193 --> 07:26.582
which means you're wrong, which
means l'm not liable for ten quid.

07:26.633 --> 07:28.988
Doesn't have to mean that.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.705
Yes it does.

07:30.753 --> 07:34.871
lt could mean that dad's not lan's dad. Durrr!

us about Liam's overdose.

lt wasn't an overdose.

08:00.553 --> 08:02.783

Your mum not in? Or your dad.
We try not to be sexist!

You have lost a fucking tonne!

08:28.433 --> 08:32.312

breakfast, a soup for lunch

08:32.352 --> 08:33.672

whale be a health professional, eh?

OK if l have a look at your brother?

08:46.353 --> 08:48.867

She's all right, in't she, sperm whale?

08:55.353 --> 08:57.787
Veronica, l gave her that name.

08:57.833 --> 09:02.224
She hated my guts at school
because l snogged a boy she fancied.

09:02.273 --> 09:04.628
Ricky Parr.

09:04.673 --> 09:07.551
A little bit of power, she'll be loving this.

09:07.593 --> 09:09.265
Right as rain.

09:09.313 --> 09:11.588
l'm surprised you're still living at home, Fiona.

09:11.633 --> 09:13.351
Thought you would've been married by now.

09:13.393 --> 09:14.746
Well, you and me both.

Hang about, l'm remembering now.

09:30.673 --> 09:32.789

09:32.833 --> 09:35.108

09:35.153 --> 09:39.431
your mum had turned into a lesbian
and run off with another woman.

09:39.473 --> 09:41.111
Chantelle?

09:41.153 --> 09:43.713
Must have been the smack talking.

09:45.993 --> 09:47.904
You take care, Liam.

09:47.953 --> 09:50.103
Carl kicked me.

09:50.153 --> 09:51.745
Did he?

09:51.793 --> 09:53.226
lt was an accident.

09:53.273 --> 09:55.070

Good luck with the wedding.

10:00.713 --> 10:01.987
Who's the lucky fella?

10:02.033 --> 10:04.911
Joey, Joey Dawson.

10:04.953 --> 10:09.151
Mrs Dawson. Fucking weird, eh? See ya!

10:10.793 --> 10:14.468

10:35.073 --> 10:38.304
You're mental, you!
How's she gonna find out?

10:38.353 --> 10:41.425
Joey's not gonna tell her,
you're not gonna tell her.

10:41.473 --> 10:43.111
lt's like it never fucking happened.

10:44.473 --> 10:45.792

10:45.833 --> 10:47.585
Shit!

10:47.633 --> 10:49.908
He's come for the van keys.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.831
That he left here last night when he crashed out

10:52.873 --> 10:54.386
cos he'd had too many

10:54.433 --> 10:56.424
before he slipped in the shower
and broke his arm.

10:56.473 --> 10:58.668
She wants to know why we
haven't got one of them mats?

10:58.713 --> 11:01.466
We have!

11:01.513 --> 11:03.981
Keys!

11:06.633 --> 11:08.624
Liam had them.

11:08.673 --> 11:11.824
They're in our house somewhere. Kitchen table.

11:11.873 --> 11:14.592
Keep her talking, yeah?

11:14.633 --> 11:16.703
Keys! Keys! Where could they be?

11:19.993 --> 11:21.631
Veronica's had a tidy-up.

11:21.673 --> 11:23.903

lucky you drove him to the hospital.

11:27.713 --> 11:30.910
He's worse than a bloody kid.
Can't let him out my sight, can l?

11:30.953 --> 11:33.786
Can l?! You're lucky he's not
suing you for loss of business.

11:33.833 --> 11:35.391
lt's not his plastering arm, is it?

11:43.473 --> 11:46.226
ls it me, or has it turned a bit?

12:00.433 --> 12:03.743
Veronica says you used to be really, really fat.

12:03.793 --> 12:05.112
Ta-da!

12:08.953 --> 12:10.864
(Katrina) Kylie had to get two buses

12:10.913 --> 12:14.269
to self-defence cos you couldn't drive her.

12:14.313 --> 12:16.827
She had a do on the number 1 2.
Forgot her inhaler.

12:16.873 --> 12:19.387
She could be dead, Joey!
You didn't think of that.

12:19.433 --> 12:21.663
Oh, thanks, Kev! Saved my life.

12:21.713 --> 12:24.625
See! l told you! Over-reaction!

12:26.953 --> 12:28.625
What?!

12:41.833 --> 12:43.391
You're not my dad.

12:45.873 --> 12:47.704
What the fuck have l done now?

12:47.753 --> 12:51.189
Type O blood, l've got,
so you can't be my real dad.

12:51.233 --> 12:54.191
lt's scientifically impossible.

12:56.073 --> 12:58.143
Of course l'm your fucking dad.

12:58.193 --> 13:01.902
Frank Gallagher does not fire blanks, lan.

13:01.953 --> 13:03.989
l can remember it clear as day.

13:04.033 --> 13:08.151
1 987, cos they'd just stopped me
claiming for my illness.

13:08.193 --> 13:10.343
Doctor said it was a fucking shaving rash.

13:10.393 --> 13:12.429
How do they sleep at night?

13:12.473 --> 13:14.907
Coming to terms with living with a disability,

13:14.953 --> 13:20.585
then bang, ''l'm late again, Frank.''
Whatever you say about Monica,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.703
she didn't look at another fella.

13:22.753 --> 13:27.463
Not until she went off with, Norma. No need.

13:27.513 --> 13:29.822
lt were 1 989.

13:29.873 --> 13:31.465
That's what l mean.

13:31.513 --> 13:33.788
1 9...

13:33.833 --> 13:35.903
..80...

13:40.793 --> 13:41.782
Gary Bennett.

13:43.393 --> 13:45.031
Fucker.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.591
She had a Saturday job in an offie.

14:03.153 --> 14:06.225
He were too fucking tight to give
her a discount, so no point...

14:07.793 --> 14:11.468
She made out it gave
her a bit of independence.

14:11.513 --> 14:13.185
He was the manager.

14:13.233 --> 14:15.986
''Gary listens to me, Frank.''

14:16.033 --> 14:18.831
We can all listen when we want
to give them one, can't we?

14:18.873 --> 14:20.022
So it's true?

14:20.073 --> 14:21.791
Falls into place, don't it?

14:21.833 --> 14:24.711
Betrayal.

14:24.753 --> 14:27.108
All the way down the fucking line.

14:29.433 --> 14:33.870
How sharper than a serpent's tooth.

14:33.913 --> 14:37.383
No, listen, right.

14:37.433 --> 14:40.789
Whatever that tosspot did to your mum,

14:40.833 --> 14:43.666
you are still my son.

14:43.713 --> 14:46.625
You're all my kids.

14:48.193 --> 14:50.548
Even a gobshite like Lip.

14:55.393 --> 14:56.382
Yes!

15:06.633 --> 15:08.544
Here, remembered.

15:08.593 --> 15:10.549
l need a sombrero and a guitar.

15:10.593 --> 15:11.662
For netball?

15:11.713 --> 15:13.783
We're making a short film in media studies.

15:13.833 --> 15:16.188
l'm a Mexican street musician.

15:16.233 --> 15:19.305
Liam, shoes on, sweetheart.
l need to get hold of mum.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.184
l just tried.

15:21.233 --> 15:23.542
Answer machine says
they're away till the 22nd.

15:23.593 --> 15:24.582
Shit.

15:24.633 --> 15:25.622
(lan) What's up?

15:25.673 --> 15:28.665
Social services want to visit.

15:28.713 --> 15:32.467
See if Liam's being looked
after properly by mum or dad.

15:32.513 --> 15:34.504
(lan) Shit!

15:35.753 --> 15:39.428
- Why were you calling mum, anyway?
- He's trying to find his real dad.

15:39.473 --> 15:41.145
What?

15:41.193 --> 15:44.071
Frank's not his dad. Gary Bennett is.

15:44.113 --> 15:46.422
Gary Bennett?

15:46.473 --> 15:48.589
How long have you known about this?

15:50.193 --> 15:53.310
There. lt's my best shot.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.390
lan.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.344
You're full of surprises.

15:58.393 --> 15:59.348
Look, l just find out.

15:59.393 --> 16:02.305
Dad reckons it were the manager of this offie

16:02.353 --> 16:04.025
where mum had a Saturday job.

16:04.073 --> 16:06.268
Offie in Eccles. Yeah, l remember.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.792
l were gonna tell you. Honest.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.266
Do you want to find him?

16:09.313 --> 16:10.712
Yeah.

16:10.753 --> 16:11.981
Why?

16:12.033 --> 16:13.512
We're your family.

16:13.553 --> 16:16.943
ls it about the other thing?

16:16.993 --> 16:18.187
No.

16:19.193 --> 16:21.707
DOORBELL

16:21.753 --> 16:24.267
Hiya.

16:24.313 --> 16:26.588
Just come off a visit up the road.

16:26.633 --> 16:29.750
Post-natal depression.
Social services been in touch yet?

16:31.633 --> 16:34.352
We got a letter from them
this morning. l mean mum did.

16:34.393 --> 16:36.907
l bet she's shitting herself, isn't she?

16:36.953 --> 16:39.706
Just kidding. As long as she turns up sober

16:39.753 --> 16:42.825
and remembers your brother's name,
we'll tick all the boxes.

16:42.873 --> 16:45.751
l tell you what, you around
at dinner time for a drink?

16:48.633 --> 16:51.306
l've got a lot on today, as it happens.

16:51.353 --> 16:52.991
l could give you a few interview tips.

16:53.033 --> 16:54.751
lt helps to know who you're dealing with.

16:54.793 --> 16:56.670
Friends in high places.

16:56.713 --> 16:58.351
l'll be there, you know.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.510
And we still haven't
caught up properly, have we?

17:01.553 --> 17:06.308
No. Yeah. Go on then. Why not?

17:06.353 --> 17:07.991
Great, look forward to it.

17:08.032 --> 17:10.991
Jockey's your local, in't it?

17:11.032 --> 17:12.546
(Fiona) Can't you just tell her the truth?

17:12.593 --> 17:16.029
''l told a white lie
and now it's got out of hand.''

17:16.073 --> 17:18.064
Yeah, she'll understand(!)

17:18.113 --> 17:21.025
l may as well tell l shagged Joey while l'm at it!

17:21.073 --> 17:23.348
Can't you wait until Monica's
back from holiday?

17:23.393 --> 17:25.906
And say Dad's looking after
the kids while she's away?

17:25.953 --> 17:29.263
The last thing we want is social
services talking to fucking Frank.

17:29.313 --> 17:31.383
Oh, yeah, right?
MUMBLlNG

17:31.433 --> 17:34.550
As far as they authorities
are concerned, Dad's dead.

17:34.593 --> 17:37.312
l'm not even Liam's legal guardian.

17:37.353 --> 17:40.663
What are you playing at?!

17:40.713 --> 17:43.147
You've been on their nearly half-an-hour.

17:43.193 --> 17:45.582
She's got a gift, Veronica.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.589
She's helping me with my arthritis.

17:47.633 --> 17:51.308
You haven't got fucking arthritis.

17:53.193 --> 17:56.629
l wish she'd keep an open mind.

17:56.673 --> 18:00.905
She even knew about Kev
losing the remote for the telly.

18:00.953 --> 18:04.423
Bollocks she did.
She's messing with your head, Mum.

18:04.473 --> 18:07.033
Fiona, will you get a grip?

18:07.073 --> 18:09.826
So, you're not officially Liam's guardian.

18:09.873 --> 18:13.343
You're over 21 , you're a better
fucking mum than Monica ever was.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.827
Go down the Jockey, see
Katrina and sort it out.

18:17.393 --> 18:19.270
You're right.

18:19.313 --> 18:20.905
You're right.

18:20.953 --> 18:23.308
What's the worst that can happen?

18:23.353 --> 18:25.821
l love you, Fiona.

18:25.873 --> 18:27.591
Fuck's sake, Joey.

18:27.633 --> 18:30.750
l mean... l mean...

18:30.793 --> 18:32.112
You don't. You can't.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.427
l do.

18:33.473 --> 18:35.031
You're engaged.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.552
You don't even know me.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.709
And we were both totally mashed.

18:38.753 --> 18:42.348
You were. l was on pineapple juice all night.

18:42.393 --> 18:44.463
Oh, shit, Joey. Please.

18:44.513 --> 18:45.707
Please.

18:45.753 --> 18:46.981
l love you.

18:47.033 --> 18:51.185
Oh, listen to him.
l love you too, honey bunny.

18:51.233 --> 18:53.622
So, what do you think, hey?

18:53.673 --> 18:56.141
Mr and Mrs Dawson.

18:56.193 --> 18:58.263
Can't believe you're still single,
Fiona. Can you, Joey?

18:58.313 --> 18:59.302
No.

18:59.353 --> 19:03.631
What's this deep dark secret
you wanted to tell me, hey?

19:03.673 --> 19:05.470
lt's not about Ricky Parr, is it?

19:05.513 --> 19:07.902
No, nothing like that.

19:07.953 --> 19:10.672
lt's... lt's silly really.

19:10.713 --> 19:13.864
l didn't realise it was you
at first when you came to the house

19:13.913 --> 19:15.983
to see our Liam.

19:16.033 --> 19:18.627
lt's more automatic than anything.

19:18.673 --> 19:21.471
Hey, secret admirer over there.

19:21.513 --> 19:22.946
Hello.

19:22.993 --> 19:25.587
You know him?

19:25.633 --> 19:28.386
Well, to talk to.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.152
l were just saying, she could do with a fella.

19:31.193 --> 19:35.106
Could you? Cos last time l saw,
you weren't going short, like.

19:35.153 --> 19:36.825
Dirty mare!

19:36.873 --> 19:39.341
We trying to fix her up, if you're interested.

19:42.913 --> 19:46.952
Sorry, mate, l didn't realise.
l was just having a laugh.

19:46.993 --> 19:49.712
What...? No, he's with me, you daft pillock.

19:49.753 --> 19:54.190
Oh, l just thought, cos youse two
were getting...

19:54.233 --> 19:56.542
Oh...right.

20:05.153 --> 20:06.347
lt weren't me.

20:08.313 --> 20:09.985
ALL SCREAM

20:21.313 --> 20:24.828
Just listen. l swear, it was a mistake.

20:24.873 --> 20:27.341
l was hammered. l don't even fancy him.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.509
Oh, no, cos the sperm whale's boyfriend

20:29.553 --> 20:32.465
wouldn't be good
enough for Fiona fucking Gallagher.

20:32.513 --> 20:37.507
Fiona fucking Gallagher can
just take whatever she likes.

20:37.553 --> 20:40.465
Little fucking Princess skinny arse.

20:44.633 --> 20:48.911
Katrina...all that stuff...

20:48.953 --> 20:51.308
We were kids, for God's sake.

20:51.353 --> 20:53.105
Think that's an excuse?

20:53.153 --> 20:54.745
Think l've fucking forgotten?

20:54.793 --> 20:56.863
Sperm whale.

20:56.913 --> 20:59.632
OK. l'm sorry.

20:59.673 --> 21:03.302
But Chatsworth Comp - it was
the law of the jungle down there.

21:03.353 --> 21:06.470
Think you were the only
one who went through it?

21:06.513 --> 21:08.151
Yeah, you were fat,

21:08.193 --> 21:10.991
and the lads used you as a spunk bucket

21:11.033 --> 21:13.024
and they weren't very nice to you.

21:13.073 --> 21:14.586
But you know what,

21:14.633 --> 21:16.624
neither were you.

21:16.673 --> 21:19.141
Pov Gallagher, remember that?

21:19.193 --> 21:22.629
''That same skirt you've been
wearing sense year seven, Pov?''

21:22.673 --> 21:25.426
''Can't afford to come on the school trip, Pov?''

21:25.473 --> 21:28.226
''Check your change, Pov's here.''

21:28.273 --> 21:31.743
Plenty of times l cried myself to sleep,

21:31.793 --> 21:36.423
so don't you make out you were
Princess fucking Di, Katrina.

21:39.393 --> 21:42.032
Right. A bit of advice.

21:42.073 --> 21:44.951
Stay away from my fiancee...

21:46.113 --> 21:47.831
..and tell your family

21:47.873 --> 21:50.751
they'd better put their best
foot forward at that interview

21:50.793 --> 21:54.308
or l'll have your shitarse of
a brother taken into care so quick

21:54.353 --> 21:56.708
he won't know what hit him.

21:56.753 --> 21:58.345
OK?!

21:58.393 --> 22:00.304
Pov!

22:02.793 --> 22:06.149
You can start saying your prayers
and all, you little twat.

22:06.193 --> 22:07.990
Aaaaah!

22:20.713 --> 22:21.907
Nipples.

22:26.273 --> 22:29.709
lt must help to have big ones
when they're feeding.

22:36.713 --> 22:38.783
Must be...

22:38.833 --> 22:41.393
lt must toughen them up,

22:41.433 --> 22:43.742
all that... (SUCKS)

22:43.793 --> 22:45.545
Can l help you?

22:45.593 --> 22:49.552
Yeah, l've come for the vouchers for formula.

22:49.593 --> 22:51.231
The name's Gallagher.

22:51.273 --> 22:53.184
Nigel and Delia.

22:55.473 --> 23:00.388
Sorry, we've got Gallagher Philip,
Gallagher lan, Gallagher Deborah.

23:00.433 --> 23:04.711
Oh, they'll be under their
mum's address, Eldon Way.

23:07.633 --> 23:08.588
Fuck off!

23:08.633 --> 23:10.908
l swap you that for that?

23:10.953 --> 23:12.989
The difference comes out my wages.

23:13.033 --> 23:17.265
But they're unopened.
l've got an arrangement. Ask Yvonne.

23:17.313 --> 23:20.988
You'd better talk to her. She'll be in at tea time.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.866
Oh, blood will out.

23:23.913 --> 23:25.141
Gary Bennett.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.745
You wouldn't give your mum
a fucking discount at the offi.

23:29.793 --> 23:31.431
Mingy little twat.

23:31.473 --> 23:33.225
l'll mention that when l see him.

23:33.273 --> 23:35.912
lt was Eccles. Fiona told me.

23:35.953 --> 23:39.025
So there's nothing to stop me finding him.

23:39.073 --> 23:42.065
Fuck off to Eccles then!

23:42.113 --> 23:45.071
Are you serious?

23:45.113 --> 23:46.387
Are you gonna go?

23:46.433 --> 23:47.661
Yeah.

23:48.273 --> 23:51.390
There's two in the phonebook.

23:51.433 --> 23:52.912
Debbie looked it up.

23:52.953 --> 23:54.511
Go for it.

23:54.553 --> 23:57.306
All that counts in the end, family.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.581
Cheers.

23:58.633 --> 24:01.067
You know what l meant.

24:01.113 --> 24:04.867
People don't realise.
Leave it to dry, and it's good as new.

24:04.913 --> 24:06.904
l haven't bought a new roll for three years.

24:08.473 --> 24:10.589
l'm not a lesbian, Fiona.

24:10.633 --> 24:12.624
l think everyone's got tendencies, but...

24:12.673 --> 24:16.109
You don't need to be, cos you'll be pretending.

24:16.153 --> 24:19.065
Playing a part, acting.

24:20.953 --> 24:21.942
Acting?

24:21.993 --> 24:24.791
You'll be you, but you'll say that

24:24.833 --> 24:30.988
you're our mum, cos we think
of you like our mum anyway, don't we?

24:33.553 --> 24:37.785
lt sets you thinking though, don't it?

24:37.833 --> 24:40.791
Like when you imagine if
you hadn't been born and

24:40.833 --> 24:43.108
someone else had met Frank.

24:43.153 --> 24:47.829
Nigel and Delia hadn't been born either.

24:49.393 --> 24:51.907
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

24:51.953 --> 24:55.229
Oh, God. l'm sorry.

24:55.273 --> 25:00.745
They've adjusted my Seroxin.
lt makes you ever so constipated too.

25:09.193 --> 25:10.592
PEOPLE CHATTER

25:10.633 --> 25:12.908
(Carol) lf my finger slips, you've had it.

25:14.473 --> 25:17.590
Come on, you lot. We need all hands on deck.

25:17.633 --> 25:19.112
(Veronica) Keep him still, Mum.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.224
What's wrong?

25:24.273 --> 25:25.672
He dared me.

25:25.713 --> 25:29.023
We're lucky the house didn't go up,
rubbish he eats.

25:29.073 --> 25:32.270
Lighting farts. Got too close to the lighter.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.190
Don't be such a bloody baby!

25:34.233 --> 25:35.791
lt's only Vaseline.

25:35.833 --> 25:36.822
Where's Lip?

25:41.953 --> 25:43.671
Anyone got munchies?

25:43.713 --> 25:46.227
Good night, was it?

25:46.273 --> 25:48.389
You knew lan was working.

25:48.433 --> 25:49.912
Carol said she'd look in.

25:49.953 --> 25:53.662
She did come really quickly when we shouted.

25:57.633 --> 25:59.112
What's up with him?

25:59.153 --> 26:01.542
Come on, sweetheart. lt's past your bedtime.

26:09.913 --> 26:12.427
DOOR SLAMS

26:12.473 --> 26:13.428
Where the fuck's Sheila?

26:13.473 --> 26:17.102
You're not at Sheila's, Dad.

26:17.153 --> 26:19.064
Dad, bathroom!

26:19.113 --> 26:20.831
Don't fucking touch me.

26:22.393 --> 26:24.304
Eccles.

26:24.353 --> 26:26.389
You told him, didn't you?

26:26.433 --> 26:28.583
You in on it and all?

26:28.633 --> 26:29.270
Whatever.

26:29.313 --> 26:33.306
Yeah, whatever. You're all the fucking same
like your fucking mother.

26:33.353 --> 26:36.311
- Don't touch...
- Aagh!

26:36.353 --> 26:38.787
Piss yourself then!

26:38.833 --> 26:40.505
Fucking piss yourself!

26:40.553 --> 26:42.430
What's he done?

26:42.473 --> 26:45.829
Get him out of here, or l swear
l'll fucking kill him! Wanker!

26:51.313 --> 26:52.746
Bastard.

26:52.793 --> 26:54.590
(Fiona) Did he piss himself?

26:54.633 --> 26:58.945
(Lip) No. Got him to the bog in time.

26:58.993 --> 27:03.145
Frank Gallagher's proudest achievement -
he got to the bog in time.

27:03.193 --> 27:04.911
Puked on the carpet though.

27:08.873 --> 27:14.106
You really don't want lan to find him,
do you? Gary what's-his-face.

27:14.153 --> 27:18.112
Up to him. Just don't see the point.

27:22.113 --> 27:24.149
Bit jealous.

27:24.193 --> 27:26.661
Little bastard gets a shot at a real dad,

27:26.713 --> 27:30.501
instead of some incontinent
fucking sperm donor.

27:30.553 --> 27:37.311
Thing about Dad, you're fine as long
as you remember to expect fuck all.

27:37.353 --> 27:42.666
Only useful thing he's ever said to me,
not at me, my whole fucking life,

27:42.713 --> 27:45.511
when l was little,

27:45.553 --> 27:47.748
l was making breakfast.

27:47.793 --> 27:51.945
Dad chucked his slice of toast
into the bin, ''Fucking useless that.''

27:51.993 --> 27:54.826
Then he showed me,

27:54.873 --> 27:59.708
''Always spread the marge into the
corners, right up to the crust.

27:59.753 --> 28:04.065
''Do the corners and you don't
have to worry about the middle.''

28:04.113 --> 28:06.866
lt's true, as it happens.

28:06.913 --> 28:08.392
Useless fucker.

28:21.953 --> 28:24.023
Right. Social services are due at 1 1 .

28:24.073 --> 28:26.951
Sheila's coming round at half ten.
Start with the bedrooms, Carl.

28:26.993 --> 28:29.382
Debbie, bathroom.

28:29.433 --> 28:31.993
Carol, you still OK looking after Liam, yeah?

28:32.033 --> 28:35.912
- What do you want me for, Fiona?
- Oh, yeah. Marty.

28:37.713 --> 28:40.830
Give me hand with a bit of lifting.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.542
Cockhead.

28:44.793 --> 28:45.908
Marty, slow down.

28:56.113 --> 28:58.104
Where's Sheila?

29:01.113 --> 29:02.626
Hiya.

29:02.673 --> 29:04.584
You brought the twins.

29:04.633 --> 29:07.386
l've been dying to air these outfits.

29:07.433 --> 29:08.912
Sorry l'm late.

29:08.953 --> 29:12.548
Only l thought it'd help to look
a bit more like you-know-who.

29:12.593 --> 29:15.061
lt's a bit difficult with my
wardrobe so l had to borrow from

29:15.113 --> 29:17.911
across the road, but she's
on the game, so she's difficult

29:17.953 --> 29:19.466
to wake before dinner time.

29:19.513 --> 29:22.949
ls it too late to do
something about the curtains?

29:58.073 --> 29:59.426
Hiya.

29:59.473 --> 30:02.112
She thinks you're planning a break-in.

30:03.673 --> 30:05.231
What are you doing here?

30:05.273 --> 30:07.025
Moral support, whatever that means.

30:07.073 --> 30:09.826
Debbie passed on the details.

30:09.873 --> 30:11.670
Are you going in?

30:11.713 --> 30:14.386
Might not even be there.

30:14.433 --> 30:16.230
Probably get his wife.

30:16.273 --> 30:20.425
l didn't think about his wife.
What if she's got kids?

30:20.473 --> 30:22.668
l might have half-brothers or sisters.

30:22.713 --> 30:23.828
Find out.

30:23.873 --> 30:25.864
Go on.

30:25.913 --> 30:28.427
Fuck it, if you're not gonna...

30:28.473 --> 30:29.144
Lip.

30:30.953 --> 30:33.308
PlANO MUSlC PLAYS

30:46.353 --> 30:48.309
Sorry, lads. We've got tea
towels coming out of our ears.

30:48.353 --> 30:49.832
No.

30:51.633 --> 30:52.952
l'm...

31:04.393 --> 31:06.384
Mrs Gallagher?

31:07.953 --> 31:10.103
Monica Gallagher?

31:10.153 --> 31:11.791
l'm Maureen Hale from social services.

31:11.833 --> 31:14.063
That's right. Come in.

31:14.113 --> 31:16.388
Thank you.

31:20.273 --> 31:21.706
Katrina.

31:28.113 --> 31:30.946
We've got your form,
Mrs Gallagher, thanks for that.

31:30.993 --> 31:34.622
Liam's doing well, in your opinion?

31:34.673 --> 31:38.552
Oh, yes, he is. lsn't he, Fiona?

31:38.593 --> 31:39.821
No problems at all.

31:39.873 --> 31:44.788
There we are, take the pot to the
kettle, never the kettle to the pot.

31:44.833 --> 31:46.903
Oh! No teaspoons.

31:50.073 --> 31:52.029
On my first visit, l saw some bruising

31:52.073 --> 31:53.711
where Liam had been hit by one of his brothers.

31:53.753 --> 31:56.950
Can you tell us how this
happened, Mrs Gallagher?

32:01.553 --> 32:03.384
lt was Lip that moved.

32:03.433 --> 32:06.072
As l said to your colleague,
it was an accident.

32:07.793 --> 32:10.705
Kettle. Kettle. Teaspoons. Teaspoons. >

32:14.073 --> 32:16.029
Hey, love.

32:16.073 --> 32:18.348
Would you get me a teaspoon, please?

32:37.713 --> 32:40.546
Shall we have a look around?

32:40.593 --> 32:43.665
l think we've seen everything
we need, Mrs Gallagher.

32:43.713 --> 32:45.908
Thanks for that.

32:45.953 --> 32:49.707
You're a very lucky boy,
Liam, having such a nice room.

32:49.753 --> 32:51.471
l've got a few questions
about the living arrangements.

32:51.513 --> 32:54.744
There seems to be
confusion about who lives where.

32:54.793 --> 32:59.423
lt's easy. l live next door
with my tenants, Carol and Marty.

32:59.473 --> 33:01.623
And everyone else lives here.

33:01.673 --> 33:03.152
(Sheila) The more the merrier.

33:03.193 --> 33:05.502
l take my hat off to you, Monica.

33:05.553 --> 33:08.351
These two looking bonny on it.

33:08.393 --> 33:10.145
Do you get your formula at the clinic?

33:10.193 --> 33:11.592
Every week.

33:11.633 --> 33:15.228
When l checked our records,
the twins are at a different address.

33:15.273 --> 33:17.070
22 Eldon Way.

33:17.113 --> 33:19.502
And according to the clinic,
they live there with their mother,

33:19.553 --> 33:23.387
Sheila Jackson. The twins are yours?

33:23.433 --> 33:24.991
Of course they are.

33:25.033 --> 33:27.308
So you must be Sheila Jackson?

33:27.353 --> 33:31.869
No, no. l'm Monica. Monica Gallagher.

33:31.913 --> 33:35.622
Monica Gallagher's living in Moston
with another woman and she abandoned

33:35.673 --> 33:38.710
her kids four years ago. lsn't that right?

33:38.753 --> 33:41.187
She's no better than she should be.

33:41.233 --> 33:43.349
l mean, l'm not.

33:43.393 --> 33:45.782
l'm only human.

33:45.833 --> 33:48.791
She's Sheila Jackson living at Eldon Way.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.789
The twins are hers by
Frank Gallagher who died

33:50.833 --> 33:53.063
just before they were born.
lt's all on the computer.

33:53.113 --> 33:57.982
Dad's dead, mum's gone,
these kids are home alone.

33:58.033 --> 34:00.069
l've applied for an
emergency care order for Liam.

34:00.113 --> 34:01.512
You fucking cow!

34:01.553 --> 34:04.863
Home alone? Who's home alone?

34:06.433 --> 34:08.900
Frank Gallagher.

34:08.953 --> 34:11.069
What can l do for you, ladies?

34:15.513 --> 34:17.708
Am l tit-of-the-year or what?

34:17.753 --> 34:19.630
l knew it were too good to be true.

34:19.672 --> 34:21.391
You've still got one more left.

34:23.793 --> 34:25.431
The Cedars.

34:25.473 --> 34:28.146
Sounds even cushier.

34:28.193 --> 34:29.831
Did you see his music?

34:29.873 --> 34:33.149
Wall-to-wall fucking jazz.

34:33.193 --> 34:35.547
You're well out of it!

34:46.433 --> 34:51.063
Christ. Dad finds out about this,
he'll wanna fuck him himself.

34:51.112 --> 34:52.592
Him?

34:54.513 --> 34:57.903
lf he owes you money,
get to the back of the queue.

34:57.953 --> 35:00.228
Oi, Gary. More people after you. >

35:16.073 --> 35:18.633
lan.

35:20.593 --> 35:21.742
Daddy!

35:23.673 --> 35:24.867
Fuck off.

35:24.913 --> 35:27.063
Daddy!

35:28.233 --> 35:30.508
Fuck off, mate!

35:32.153 --> 35:33.302
What? What?

35:33.753 --> 35:35.232
Who are you?

35:37.113 --> 35:40.469
Difference between Gary and Frank - zilch!

35:46.033 --> 35:48.263
Human error, see.

35:48.313 --> 35:51.942
Ghost in the machine.

35:51.993 --> 35:53.631
Literally.

35:53.673 --> 35:56.745
Reports of my death have
been greatly exaggerated.

35:58.873 --> 36:03.424
Computers, you see, Maureen.
Only as good as the person putting stuff in.

36:03.473 --> 36:06.909
Garbage in, garbage out.

36:06.953 --> 36:11.469
Data in a computer literally
means what's put in it.

36:11.513 --> 36:15.631
Data, right? Not information.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.904
So you're not living at Eldon Way?

36:23.713 --> 36:26.022
Not to my knowledge, love.

36:26.073 --> 36:27.825
And she's Mrs Gallagher, is she?

36:30.393 --> 36:35.751
l am proud to say, yeah.
last time l looked, anyway.

36:35.793 --> 36:37.909
l really think that's everything...

36:37.953 --> 36:40.786
lf you're happy with the explanation
of why Liam's so accident-prone.

36:40.833 --> 36:42.312
Oh, look at him.

36:42.353 --> 36:46.426
Liam, come here, son.

36:46.473 --> 36:49.351
Look at that. He's got more
injuries than Michael Owen.

36:49.393 --> 36:51.111
He broke his wrist last year.

36:51.153 --> 36:53.303
He fell off his scooter, yeah.

36:53.353 --> 36:56.311
(Maureen) What are you getting at, Katrina?

36:56.353 --> 36:59.629
lt's obvious. She's his care giver
and she's not up to it.

36:59.673 --> 37:03.143
Hang on, what are you saying, love?

37:03.193 --> 37:05.502
She looks after him, doesn't she?

37:08.553 --> 37:11.021
Too fucking right she does.

37:11.073 --> 37:13.746
And makes a cracking job of it.

37:13.793 --> 37:15.863
Her mum fucked off.

37:15.913 --> 37:18.108
That's a crime, is it?

37:18.153 --> 37:22.032
Trying to give your brothers and
sisters the right start in life.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.665
Paperwork, is that what you want?

37:23.713 --> 37:25.510
Cos, it's all here,

37:25.553 --> 37:28.272
in black-and-white.
All his jabs, right up to date.

37:28.313 --> 37:30.668
Hospital appointments for his...whatsit.

37:30.713 --> 37:32.305
Fitting.

37:32.353 --> 37:33.706
All kept. Physio for his leg.

37:33.753 --> 37:35.311
Wrist.

37:35.353 --> 37:36.786
All kept. She misses work for him.

37:36.833 --> 37:38.505
Never complains.

37:38.553 --> 37:42.262
You talk to his nursery.
A few problems, but he's three...

37:42.313 --> 37:43.712
Four.

37:43.753 --> 37:45.311
(Frank) ..years old.

37:45.353 --> 37:46.991
Bright as a button.

37:47.033 --> 37:49.547
He's got friends, hasn't he?

37:49.593 --> 37:51.868
His teachers will tell you.

37:51.913 --> 37:54.347
And l'll tell you what.

37:54.393 --> 37:56.861
You can't write it down in a book

37:56.913 --> 38:02.112
or sign a form for it or get a fucking voucher.

38:02.153 --> 38:05.509
But, he's loved.

38:09.113 --> 38:11.422
Loved.

38:11.473 --> 38:14.863
By that lass over there.

38:17.593 --> 38:22.792
So put that in Tony Blair's pipe and
fucking smoke it. l mean, fuck off.

38:22.833 --> 38:25.301
lf that's a kiddie that being abused,
l'm Miriam Stoppard.

38:25.353 --> 38:28.823
There's no question of abuse, Mr Gallagher.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.352
l can see Liam's been well looked after.

38:30.393 --> 38:34.511
He's just admitted he lives
with her and she's in charge.

38:34.553 --> 38:36.271
And l don't see a problem.

38:36.313 --> 38:41.387
l'll tell you the problem.
l shagged her boyfriend.

38:41.433 --> 38:45.062
You shagged him?
l thought you fucking snogged him.

38:45.113 --> 38:47.343
lt was a mistake.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.190
Oh, yeah? A mistake.

38:49.233 --> 38:52.782
You just think,
''Here's the man Katrina's gonna marry.

38:52.833 --> 38:55.984
''l know, why don't l wreck her fucking life?''

38:56.033 --> 38:58.866
She made my life a misery at school.

38:58.913 --> 39:01.746
We were 1 4. Everyone's life was a misery.

39:01.793 --> 39:03.943
You pissed on my PE kit!

39:11.353 --> 39:14.584
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr and Mrs Gallagher. Personnel.

39:14.633 --> 39:16.191
The odd one slips through the net.

39:16.233 --> 39:17.985
Human error again, Maureen.

39:18.033 --> 39:22.424
Hey, remember. Data, not information.

39:22.473 --> 39:23.872
(Sheila) Bye.

39:23.913 --> 39:24.902
Bye.

39:32.273 --> 39:36.312
Wedding's still on, you know!
23rd August, so l don't wanna see or hear...

39:41.393 --> 39:43.861
Did you really piss on her PE kit?

39:43.913 --> 39:46.711
No, that was Alison Grant.

39:46.753 --> 39:48.345
l just held the bag open.

39:50.353 --> 39:52.423
(Sheila) And she said... And she said...

39:52.473 --> 39:56.307
She said... Sorry. She said,

39:56.353 --> 40:00.346
''l'm sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr and Mrs Gallagher.''

40:00.393 --> 40:02.907
Didn't she, Frank?

40:02.953 --> 40:05.103
Too fucking right she did.

40:05.153 --> 40:08.828
You played a fucking blinder, Frank.

40:08.873 --> 40:11.865
lt's natural, isn't it? A father's instinct

40:11.913 --> 40:15.223
to defend his offspring. Like lions. Come here.

40:15.273 --> 40:18.424
Actually, male lions kill theirs.

40:18.473 --> 40:20.703
l've seen it in a documentary.

40:20.753 --> 40:22.471
New fucking man, me, Debbie.

40:22.513 --> 40:26.825
Frank, l'm proud to call her Mrs Gallagher.

40:26.873 --> 40:30.627
He came straight out with it. He did.

40:30.673 --> 40:32.664
Do you like the sound of the that, Sheil?

40:32.713 --> 40:35.750
Hey, hey. Stop fucking stirring it.

40:35.793 --> 40:38.671
KNOCK ON DOOR

40:39.753 --> 40:44.349
Sperm and egg,
split second, accident of nature.

40:44.393 --> 40:48.591
The nurture, that's being a fucking parent.

40:48.633 --> 40:50.032
Forget about it, will you?

40:50.073 --> 40:51.586
You've got to tell her.

40:51.633 --> 40:53.464
Tell Katrina we didn't shag.

40:53.513 --> 40:54.741
She already knows we did.

40:54.793 --> 40:55.225
But we didn't.

40:55.273 --> 40:59.061
Joey... Didn't we?

40:59.113 --> 41:02.105
You were totally out of it,
weren't you? lt wouldn't have been...

41:02.153 --> 41:03.108
So we didn't?

41:03.153 --> 41:04.472
No.

41:07.513 --> 41:09.743
Fiona!

41:09.793 --> 41:12.512
You will tell her, won't you?

41:12.553 --> 41:15.784
My dad's got £80 deposit
down on a Gandalf costume.

41:15.833 --> 41:17.425
FRANK SNORES
l was lost

41:17.473 --> 41:19.623
Oh, yeah

41:20.713 --> 41:23.386
Oh, yeah...

41:31.033 --> 41:34.389
Lads, you're gonna have
to give your dad a hand.

41:34.433 --> 41:36.947
He's worn out.

41:36.993 --> 41:38.949
Oh!

41:38.993 --> 41:40.745
Come on.

41:44.673 --> 41:46.789
lan!

41:46.833 --> 41:48.824
Come on, l can't shift him on my own.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.625
He's not my dad, is he?

41:55.073 --> 41:58.702
Stop fucking around, will you?
You can't just fucking resign.

41:58.753 --> 42:00.232
Come on.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.705
(Fiona) Problem?

42:07.793 --> 42:09.624
No.

42:09.673 --> 42:12.392
Just taking Dad back to Sheila's.

42:18.233 --> 42:20.872
(lan) 'Fiona reckoned it was a first.

42:20.913 --> 42:24.144
'Dad and Sheila actually helping us
out for once instead of landing us

42:24.193 --> 42:26.184
'in the shit.

42:26.233 --> 42:29.987
'Not that she'd have wanted them
round at ours all the time.

42:30.033 --> 42:31.671
'None of us would.

42:31.713 --> 42:35.228
'You just get used to things the way they are.

42:35.273 --> 42:40.028
'And at the end of the day,
it's better the devil you know.

42:40.073 --> 42:42.667
'Early Kylie? Totally true.'

42:45.913 --> 42:47.346
l'm carrying his baby.

42:47.393 --> 42:48.508
Fiona!

42:49.753 --> 42:51.584
(Man) Had an accident?

42:51.633 --> 42:53.146
Boo!

42:53.193 --> 42:55.627
Oh, Jesus! Where's my tooth?

42:55.673 --> 42:59.461
Remember, Frank, no-win,
no-fee, and we will win.

42:59.513 --> 43:04.303
lf you wanna keep it, you don't
have to bring it up alone. City!

43:04.353 --> 43:04.990
Oi! >

43:06.673 --> 43:08.550
You bastard!

43:08.593 --> 43:11.949
Shops had to close down because
of him and you don't give a fuck.

43:11.993 --> 43:14.109
l've booked the abortion.

43:15.153 --> 43:17.428
Blood. l've been shot!

43:17.473 --> 43:20.351
My God, Frank. What have you done?
