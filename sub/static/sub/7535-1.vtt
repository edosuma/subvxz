02:08.761 --> 02:09.386
Hey

02:11.197 --> 02:11.891
Stop! Hey!

02:17.770 --> 02:19.101
Stop! Mister

02:28.414 --> 02:29.574
What is your name?

02:29.782 --> 02:30.680
Shit!

02:32.552 --> 02:33.541
It means...

02:33.887 --> 02:35.354
...asking for your name

02:36.523 --> 02:37.820
There is a "Shit" man

02:38.291 --> 02:39.223
wanting us to stop

02:41.194 --> 02:42.388
But in such remote places,

02:42.695 --> 02:43.889
we should not stop...

02:44.197 --> 02:45.221
...for strangers

02:46.966 --> 02:48.297
He may die of thirst

02:48.768 --> 02:49.928
if we don't stop for him

02:51.471 --> 02:52.438
Seven, tell him to pull over at once

02:52.739 --> 02:53.865
Yes

02:56.042 --> 02:58.567
Master, I've been eating too many
beans and suffer diarrhea from it

02:58.912 --> 03:00.709
If I don't have rice soon,
I'll die too

03:01.247 --> 03:02.976
Stop!

03:03.416 --> 03:05.475
Fai-hong, he can't hear you

03:06.686 --> 03:07.914
What are you doing?

03:08.321 --> 03:09.879
Climbing!

03:13.826 --> 03:15.885
Pal, please stop to save that guy

03:16.062 --> 03:17.086
What kind of talk's it?

03:20.066 --> 03:21.260
What are you doing?

03:37.617 --> 03:39.346
Craziest damn thing I've ever seen

03:43.223 --> 03:45.191
Nothing makes me happier than
saving a life

03:46.359 --> 03:47.326
How about saving yourself first?

03:57.503 --> 03:58.868
Much obliged Ma'am,

03:59.439 --> 04:00.997
folks round here call me Billy!

04:02.308 --> 04:03.172
Nice to meet you!

04:04.010 --> 04:05.500
I am Wong Fai-hong!

04:05.712 --> 04:06.542
Pleasure!

04:07.313 --> 04:08.439
This is a good chance...

04:08.615 --> 04:10.344
...to practice your English,
come on

04:10.850 --> 04:12.943
Who, what, where, when!

04:14.587 --> 04:15.554
Who, what, where, when!

04:18.091 --> 04:18.887
When!

04:18.958 --> 04:19.788
When what?

04:21.461 --> 04:22.393
I am Diana

04:22.495 --> 04:23.223
Pleasure Ma'am

04:24.364 --> 04:24.955
When?

04:26.599 --> 04:27.327
Nothing

04:33.539 --> 04:34.335
You know how?

04:34.707 --> 04:35.605
I know everything!

06:12.972 --> 06:14.371
See, here is the America,

06:14.607 --> 06:16.074
and right there is where we are,

06:16.576 --> 06:18.703
right there, that's my home town

06:20.913 --> 06:22.676
My folks and I lived back east
for a while

06:23.182 --> 06:24.479
But things didn't work out

06:24.751 --> 06:26.309
So we moved out here looking for
a new start

06:26.619 --> 06:27.517
You know what I mean?

06:29.088 --> 06:29.816
Yeah

06:29.856 --> 06:30.754
Yeah! Yeah!

06:30.890 --> 06:31.857
Ma'am

06:31.924 --> 06:32.982
Hi

06:37.130 --> 06:38.222
You really understand what he said?

06:39.332 --> 06:40.560
No

06:41.134 --> 06:42.294
I simply pretend that I do

06:46.005 --> 06:46.562
Yeah?

06:46.873 --> 06:47.396
Yeah!

06:47.907 --> 06:48.430
Yeah!

06:48.941 --> 06:49.498
Yeah!

06:51.644 --> 06:52.406
Yeah!

06:52.612 --> 06:53.738
Yeah... Yeah...

06:56.616 --> 06:57.810
Cut the bull shit and start eating

07:00.887 --> 07:02.115
It's beans again?

07:03.189 --> 07:04.679
We have to be very lucky to make it
to the America

07:08.361 --> 07:09.555
Ah Sol's clinic...

07:09.695 --> 07:10.753
there is also called
Po Chi Lam right?

07:11.230 --> 07:13.664
Exactly under the same name

07:20.406 --> 07:21.202
Having to go through this...

07:21.240 --> 07:22.366
...to pay him a visit,

07:22.475 --> 07:23.271
he must be joking

07:28.381 --> 07:29.643
Master, we ain't no need to live
on beans anymore

07:33.886 --> 07:35.080
Where are you going?

07:35.855 --> 07:37.220
How would you like to have
chicken buff for appetizer?

07:40.159 --> 07:41.751
Coffee, tea, or me?

07:41.994 --> 07:43.723
Or me? How do I drink you?

07:51.037 --> 07:52.834
You are such a woodshed

07:58.211 --> 08:02.739
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,

08:03.115 --> 08:05.948
I, J, K, L, M, N...

08:06.018 --> 08:08.282
Do you like O?

08:13.259 --> 08:14.157
I like an O!

08:21.067 --> 08:22.159
Now,

08:22.268 --> 08:23.462
don't you ever say that
I have no sense of humour

08:37.116 --> 08:38.481
Thank you Ma'am

08:39.784 --> 08:41.753
I've told you never
talk to strangers

08:42.722 --> 08:43.154
Come on

09:37.310 --> 09:37.867
Be careful!

10:12.812 --> 10:13.574
Daddy!

10:13.879 --> 10:14.641
Go, let's go

10:28.294 --> 10:29.192
No-shadow Kick!

10:36.469 --> 10:37.401
Master, many barbarians here!

10:37.937 --> 10:38.426
Protect Aunt Yee

10:38.671 --> 10:39.638
Yes!

10:52.785 --> 10:53.342
I can manage on my own

11:24.950 --> 11:25.712
Move out

11:55.915 --> 11:56.847
Fai-hong, Seven!

11:58.584 --> 11:59.983
The horses are beyond control

12:04.223 --> 12:05.155
Give me a ride!

12:29.582 --> 12:30.913
Yee, I'm here to save you!

12:31.450 --> 12:32.781
Seven!

12:33.052 --> 12:34.019
This is dangerous, go back in

12:34.220 --> 12:35.152
Yes!

12:39.391 --> 12:40.517
Hands off my carriage

12:42.528 --> 12:44.052
Where is your Master?
Fai-hong, where are you?

12:44.263 --> 12:45.628
What did you say? I can't hear you
Take care of your back

12:47.399 --> 12:48.229
Watch my kick!

12:50.336 --> 12:50.859
I don't need you

12:52.905 --> 12:53.496
Out!

12:53.873 --> 12:54.430
Sit properly

13:18.831 --> 13:19.422
Be care

13:20.666 --> 13:21.257
Hold it tight!

13:35.147 --> 13:35.772
Fai-hong...

13:39.652 --> 13:40.710
Fai-hong...

13:40.886 --> 13:41.580
Yee...

13:41.687 --> 13:42.654
Master

13:42.755 --> 13:44.552
Seven...

13:45.291 --> 13:45.882
Yee...

13:51.831 --> 13:52.388
Fai...

14:01.273 --> 14:02.103
Fai-hong...

14:19.258 --> 14:20.122
Thank you Billy!

14:20.793 --> 14:22.021
Ma'am!

14:22.061 --> 14:24.529
That's all I have to show for
gratitude from me and my family

14:25.164 --> 14:25.994
Go on take it

14:26.398 --> 14:27.160
Thanks

14:28.367 --> 14:29.391
It's quality!

14:40.913 --> 14:42.904
Hi, boss, these are clean

14:43.816 --> 14:44.544
Let's go!

14:47.653 --> 14:49.280
Hi Lola!

14:49.955 --> 14:51.252
Hi how are you? Lone

14:51.390 --> 14:52.322
I'm fine, thank you

14:53.492 --> 14:54.550
Beer

14:55.160 --> 14:56.889
Hello, Dr. So
Hi Susan

14:58.163 --> 14:59.653
You've got dark circles
under your eyes

15:00.099 --> 15:01.566
Did you get not enough sleep
last night?

15:02.001 --> 15:02.990
OK! I guess

15:03.869 --> 15:05.860
Well! Why don't I come over
to your clinic later

15:06.038 --> 15:07.164
So you can check me up

15:07.539 --> 15:09.439
Sure, sure. Come by anytime!

15:10.109 --> 15:13.545
Yes... why don't you come
along with Lola too?

15:16.882 --> 15:19.146
I'll buy you a drink!

15:19.218 --> 15:19.980
Are you sure?

15:20.052 --> 15:20.916
It's alright

15:21.020 --> 15:21.714
OK

15:21.854 --> 15:22.821
See you later

15:28.060 --> 15:29.527
No beer for Chinamen

15:34.333 --> 15:36.893
This one's on me

15:59.625 --> 16:00.751
You just passing through?

16:01.393 --> 16:02.189
No

16:02.461 --> 16:03.894
Hello. Mr. Mayor

16:04.363 --> 16:05.387
Out!

16:05.564 --> 16:07.532
I just want to...

16:10.536 --> 16:12.527
Take it easy son, he's the Mayor!

16:13.672 --> 16:14.900
Out...
Why are you doing this for...

16:15.107 --> 16:16.005
Out

16:16.608 --> 16:17.199
Let's go

16:17.476 --> 16:18.272
I am sorry

16:28.120 --> 16:28.848
Problem?

16:29.555 --> 16:30.522
Just a little one!

16:30.723 --> 16:33.191
Remember, you ain't Abraham Lincoln

16:33.559 --> 16:35.493
C'mon, let me buy you a drink

16:35.828 --> 16:38.456
No, thanks Sheriff
Abraham Lincoln doesn't drink

17:05.190 --> 17:06.781
No big deal!

17:06.959 --> 17:09.621
The beer in town isn't good enough!

17:11.329 --> 17:12.262
Sit down...

17:12.297 --> 17:13.194
Let me take a look!

17:13.265 --> 17:15.096
It hurts
It's alright

17:15.200 --> 17:16.189
Take a seat...

17:16.868 --> 17:17.767
Wait

17:25.010 --> 17:26.307
How's he doing?

17:39.792 --> 17:42.056
Po Chi Lam? What's that mean?

17:43.529 --> 17:44.359
Advertisement!

17:46.899 --> 17:48.526
Dr. So, help!

17:48.667 --> 17:50.567
Dr. So, where are you?

17:50.702 --> 17:51.691
Bring them in...

17:51.870 --> 17:54.031
What's happened?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.236
We saved them...

17:58.343 --> 17:59.901
...from the Gold Sand River

18:00.112 --> 18:01.170
They've waken up for a short while,

18:01.313 --> 18:02.245
then again lost consciousness

18:05.184 --> 18:05.809
Seven!

18:06.819 --> 18:07.581
Aunt Yee

18:11.857 --> 18:12.448
Ying,

18:12.658 --> 18:13.625
Yes, Master!

18:13.792 --> 18:15.657
Go massage his chest

18:15.794 --> 18:16.818
By using the technique which
you have just learnt

18:17.396 --> 18:19.330
Doctor... may I massage
this lady for you?

18:19.431 --> 18:21.399
No... I'll help her...

18:21.500 --> 18:22.865
Stop!
What are you guys fighting for?

18:22.901 --> 18:24.232
Let's take turn

18:24.369 --> 18:25.768
I'll be the first. Yes...

18:25.938 --> 18:26.927
Wait! She is...

18:27.072 --> 18:31.202
She is my master's fiancée,

18:31.910 --> 18:32.899
don't you dare trying a finger on her

18:35.414 --> 18:36.506
Let me give you a hand!

18:36.682 --> 18:40.118
If you want to kiss somebody,
kiss me!

18:40.586 --> 18:41.883
I ain't trying to kiss her

18:42.921 --> 18:44.889
This white bastard actually
wants more!

18:45.324 --> 18:48.623
Shut up

18:48.760 --> 18:49.283
She's awake now

18:49.461 --> 18:50.052
Seven!

18:50.162 --> 18:51.254
Aunt Yee

18:52.531 --> 18:54.123
I am damn hungry

18:55.334 --> 18:55.891
Seven!

18:56.368 --> 18:57.335
Fai-hong!

19:17.689 --> 19:18.951
I have a new son!

19:25.130 --> 19:27.598
This weave is excellent,
we should learn how to do it

19:28.267 --> 19:31.862
Father, the great spirit has
blessed me with another son

19:54.126 --> 19:55.593
Where am I?

20:07.139 --> 20:08.163
Stop!

20:11.777 --> 20:13.210
Why do you treat him so badly?

20:13.512 --> 20:14.638
His coat is different,

20:15.214 --> 20:16.511
his skin color is different,

20:16.915 --> 20:18.314
his speech is different

20:18.917 --> 20:20.248
His blood is red. Like us

20:20.419 --> 20:21.477
My God!

20:21.587 --> 20:22.884
But, it will not flow for us

20:23.222 --> 20:24.985
In the end I afraid
we will be bleeding for him

20:25.924 --> 20:26.515
No!

20:26.625 --> 20:27.887
Go away

20:28.293 --> 20:30.158
How can you be so rude to a lady?

20:48.480 --> 20:49.378
What is your name? What is your name?
What is your name?

20:49.615 --> 20:50.639
What is your name?
What is your name?

20:52.918 --> 20:56.786
"What is your name" means...

20:57.189 --> 20:58.679
...what's your name in Chinese!

20:58.890 --> 20:59.948
What is your name?

21:00.659 --> 21:03.219
Master,
I've been eating too many beans,

21:03.395 --> 21:05.761
if I don't have rice soon,
I'll die too

21:11.470 --> 21:12.903
Watch out! The Red Hair's coming

21:34.826 --> 21:35.986
I beg your pardon

21:43.101 --> 21:46.593
Wong Fai-hong... Master Wong...

21:49.975 --> 21:50.805
Aunt Yee

21:52.944 --> 21:54.809
Aunt Yee,
would you like a cup of tea?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.079
Master Wong

21:59.284 --> 22:00.751
Wong Fai-hong

22:03.655 --> 22:04.553
This is Master's umbrella!

22:04.690 --> 22:06.055
Aunt Yee...

22:07.392 --> 22:08.552
Look, this is Master's umbrella

22:11.363 --> 22:14.093
Aunt Yee,
shall we have lunch first?

22:14.333 --> 22:15.698
I ain't hungry. You guys go ahead

22:19.104 --> 22:21.072
What are you Chinese doing here?

22:22.074 --> 22:23.166
We are looking for a friend

22:23.575 --> 22:24.974
He had an accident up river

22:25.177 --> 22:26.906
Now you know Mayor Barclay...

22:27.012 --> 22:29.776
...doesn't wanna see you
Chinese outside your alley

22:31.783 --> 22:33.876
Would you just pretend
you did not see us?

22:34.886 --> 22:36.615
Sorry. No, I can't do

22:37.923 --> 22:40.414
You bastard,
we are only searching for our friend

22:40.892 --> 22:42.826
They treat us Chinese miners
like dogs,

22:42.928 --> 22:44.520
having all kinds of
restrictions on us

22:44.629 --> 22:46.358
Yeah!
We are always on the wrong side

22:46.498 --> 22:48.796
Shall we stand together and
overcome him now?

22:49.034 --> 22:53.698
No... The sergeant is nice to us
Chinese indeed!

22:54.206 --> 22:56.174
Remember?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.741
He had driven away some white
bastards for us several times

22:59.177 --> 23:00.371
Let's go!

23:02.381 --> 23:02.904
Hey!

23:03.415 --> 23:03.972
Yes?

23:04.249 --> 23:05.375
Remember,

23:05.617 --> 23:08.017
no Chinese women allowed here

23:08.553 --> 23:10.248
That's the law

23:10.622 --> 23:11.884
I will not forget

23:16.461 --> 23:18.861
Goodbye, Mr Lincoln

23:25.704 --> 23:29.003
Don't worry Ma'am
Wong Fei-hong is gonna be just fine

23:30.075 --> 23:31.906
Hey! What are you doing here?

23:32.711 --> 23:34.144
Behave yourself or
I won't give you face

23:34.546 --> 23:35.376
What?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.506
"What"? The hell!

23:40.952 --> 23:42.817
What the hell? I like that

24:20.158 --> 24:24.720
It's raining dogs and cats,
please go back inside

24:26.264 --> 24:29.665
No, Fai-hong won't find us
when he is back

24:31.937 --> 24:35.395
Master would be upset
if you fell sick

24:36.208 --> 24:37.937
Exactly, please go back inside

25:08.340 --> 25:09.102
Fai-hong...

25:09.374 --> 25:10.568
Yee...

25:10.876 --> 25:12.070
Master...

25:12.244 --> 25:13.871
Seven...

25:14.112 --> 25:16.080
Yee...

25:17.082 --> 25:18.606
Water topples a boat and

25:18.750 --> 25:20.308
so it floats one

25:20.519 --> 25:22.350
Hardness and softness can grow
or temper with each other

25:22.454 --> 25:23.580
This is the spirit of Tai Chi

25:23.755 --> 25:24.881
Reckless movement repels,
stay clam and you stay as one piece

25:25.056 --> 25:26.148
Understand?

25:26.258 --> 25:27.418
OK, show me what you have learnt
from Tai Chi

25:27.526 --> 25:28.117
Yes, Master

25:57.856 --> 25:59.585
Give way...

26:00.725 --> 26:02.249
What are you guys looking at?

26:02.360 --> 26:03.224
It is a woman

26:03.261 --> 26:04.285
What's so excited about a woman?

26:04.362 --> 26:05.989
Uncle Han, don't you think
you're too old for that?

26:06.665 --> 26:07.723
But I can still see well...

26:07.899 --> 26:08.866
...with my eyes

26:10.335 --> 26:12.326
Shoot!
We are closed for business today

26:12.637 --> 26:13.763
Aunt Yee!

26:13.838 --> 26:15.806
Seven, help me to check its texture

26:16.908 --> 26:17.772
Yes!

26:17.842 --> 26:18.604
Should I add more water?

26:20.278 --> 26:21.711
Good! ...Good!...

26:36.962 --> 26:38.623
Sol, what are you eating?

26:41.032 --> 26:41.862
This is glue

26:43.902 --> 26:44.698
Is it sticky enough?

26:44.903 --> 26:45.961
Very!

26:48.306 --> 26:50.274
And you!
Why did you say it tastes good?

26:50.976 --> 26:52.534
I did not! I was only nodding

26:53.678 --> 26:54.542
Go post these Lost and

26:54.646 --> 26:55.442
Found bills on the street

26:55.880 --> 26:56.676
Yes Ma'am

26:58.683 --> 26:59.411
Let's go, gluey-mouth

27:14.366 --> 27:15.162
Post one here

27:24.809 --> 27:25.776
Post one here!

27:36.154 --> 27:39.681
Hey! What the hell you boys think
you're doing here?

27:40.291 --> 27:41.349
Why did you tear...

27:41.459 --> 27:42.323
...our poster away?

27:42.394 --> 27:43.588
We're looking for our master!

27:44.295 --> 27:45.853
You can't hang those posters here!

27:46.464 --> 27:47.431
What did he say?

27:47.699 --> 27:49.929
Nothing... Let's go

27:53.104 --> 27:55.163
You hang one more poster,
you're going to jail

28:04.449 --> 28:05.780
Forget about them! Let's go

28:06.618 --> 28:07.243
Deputy!

28:23.835 --> 28:24.529
Damn!

28:24.669 --> 28:25.499
The money

28:58.837 --> 28:59.667
Hey, you are good

28:59.771 --> 29:00.965
Thanks partner,

29:01.039 --> 29:03.007
when are you going to teach me

29:03.475 --> 29:04.100
What?

29:04.509 --> 29:05.305
This!

29:08.346 --> 29:09.278
Can you show me?

29:10.215 --> 29:11.876
You want to learn leg stance?

29:13.017 --> 29:13.881
If not you can put up
with the hardship

29:15.420 --> 29:16.387
Like this!

29:16.488 --> 29:17.819
Press each of your legs like this
for 4 hours

29:19.691 --> 29:22.091
That's all it takes

29:22.227 --> 29:23.091
Alright

29:23.394 --> 29:24.884
OK boys, you're under arrest,

29:25.497 --> 29:26.464
the jail's that way

29:26.831 --> 29:29.527
Take it easy partner
I've got everything under control

29:30.135 --> 29:31.227
Yeah, move it

29:32.070 --> 29:33.037
Alright come on

29:34.606 --> 29:35.800
What do they call you son?

29:36.341 --> 29:37.603
My name is Billy!

29:37.709 --> 29:40.303
Billy,
interested in being my deputy?

29:40.912 --> 29:42.777
We'll talk after I get my reward

29:44.716 --> 29:45.444
Nick

29:46.017 --> 29:47.177
You done yet?

29:47.385 --> 29:48.545
God damn Sheriff

29:49.154 --> 29:53.090
you made me lose my count
Now I have to start all over again

29:54.192 --> 29:55.921
Sheriff, the pay is bad

29:56.060 --> 29:57.391
I've to cut partial of my freedom

29:57.529 --> 29:58.860
I understand!

29:59.497 --> 30:01.988
You can come to work with me
only when there is a trouble

30:03.468 --> 30:05.936
Sheriff, you got yourself a deputy

30:06.738 --> 30:09.536
Good, try this on for size

30:29.060 --> 30:30.186
Hi, if you see this man,

30:30.328 --> 30:31.317
we're at the clinic

30:34.232 --> 30:35.199
If you see this man,

30:35.300 --> 30:36.130
we're at the clinic

30:38.970 --> 30:39.902
How about a drink?

30:40.505 --> 30:41.233
No, thank you

30:43.875 --> 30:44.899
When I say drink,

30:45.677 --> 30:46.939
you drink

30:48.880 --> 30:49.437
Hey! Leave him alone

30:49.581 --> 30:50.206
You shut up

31:01.993 --> 31:03.085
Have another

31:12.003 --> 31:13.470
You are a pretty China doll

31:15.440 --> 31:16.600
Hey lady where are you going?

31:17.976 --> 31:19.841
If you don't want to drink

31:21.045 --> 31:22.478
Then wear it!

31:30.021 --> 31:30.919
Stop it stop it stop it...

31:31.322 --> 31:33.654
Aunt Yee! Aunt Yee

31:44.102 --> 31:47.071
Now all the boys,
I wouldn't do that if I were you,

31:52.977 --> 31:55.707
you wanna fight,
well, you've got one

32:05.657 --> 32:07.625
I ain't looking for no fight

32:07.992 --> 32:09.254
That's good

32:10.261 --> 32:12.559
Now I want a fight!
Seven, teach them a lesson

32:12.897 --> 32:13.864
Sure!

32:16.467 --> 32:18.162
Why don't we try something different,
pal?

32:19.070 --> 32:20.435
Care for a friendly wager?

32:21.673 --> 32:24.506
Now I bet this Chinamen can
wipe you out...

32:24.642 --> 32:25.631
...without your guns

32:25.810 --> 32:27.277
And my money is on the Chinamen, pal

32:27.912 --> 32:29.379
which one is man enough
to fight him?

32:56.074 --> 32:57.200
I win!

32:57.442 --> 32:59.501
No, this is only good for a warm up
since master isn't around

32:59.978 --> 33:00.672
Sol, translate for me

33:00.945 --> 33:01.809
What?

33:01.913 --> 33:03.312
Tell them to fight me all at once

33:03.348 --> 33:05.316
They are the winner
if anyone of them beat me

33:05.583 --> 33:06.379
What did he say?

33:07.618 --> 33:09.449
He said he wants to fight you all

33:09.787 --> 33:11.254
If you win, you can keep the money

33:11.389 --> 33:13.516
AII? Wait a minute,

33:14.258 --> 33:15.122
we might lose!

33:15.927 --> 33:18.054
Seven, he said if...

33:18.196 --> 33:18.958
Trust me

33:19.163 --> 33:20.095
Trust me

33:20.765 --> 33:22.232
Sorry! Trust him!

34:03.975 --> 34:04.907
I am a happy man

34:06.310 --> 34:07.072
Me too

34:07.712 --> 34:08.643
Aunt Yee, what about you?

34:08.980 --> 34:09.605
Me too

34:12.850 --> 34:13.942
Thank you!

34:23.460 --> 34:25.156
How can I enjoy
this beautiful landscape now?

34:26.264 --> 34:27.322
Why don't you take me back to...

34:27.431 --> 34:28.728
...where you found me?

34:29.266 --> 34:30.859
Maybe I can remember
where I come from

34:32.469 --> 34:34.734
Only you have no idea
on what I am saying

34:41.446 --> 34:44.279
Clothes, how I wish you could talk

34:45.116 --> 34:46.947
Then you would be able to
explain everything

34:59.497 --> 35:05.629
Master... America... Setting up
Po Chi Lam... One year anniversary,

35:07.905 --> 35:08.894
Sol...

35:10.641 --> 35:12.131
What's this letter about?

35:12.643 --> 35:14.702
Is it by me or for me?

35:18.449 --> 35:19.541
My name is Sol?

35:21.752 --> 35:24.118
...and I have a master?

35:25.256 --> 35:27.884
I must find him,
he will have the answer

35:31.162 --> 35:32.151
Wong Fai!

35:33.965 --> 35:35.398
This name sounds familiar,

35:36.667 --> 35:38.100
I must have known him

35:38.236 --> 35:39.965
If I found him,
everything would be explained

36:03.794 --> 36:07.195
What can I do for you?

36:07.698 --> 36:12.362
I want to marry your daughter!

36:13.171 --> 36:14.604
How dare you insult my sister?

36:18.009 --> 36:20.102
You are the weakest among
all the tribes,

36:20.511 --> 36:21.978
if you don't give me your daughter,

36:22.113 --> 36:23.011
I will destroy you all

36:26.751 --> 36:27.945
Fierce Eagle!

36:30.388 --> 36:33.380
We are not afraid of you,
we will fight you to death!

36:43.501 --> 36:44.399
Fierce Eagle!

36:58.916 --> 36:59.814
Please, do not fight!

37:00.651 --> 37:02.278
Hey, don't...

37:04.722 --> 37:06.553
Yellow, please do not fight him

37:23.708 --> 37:24.231
Hey...

37:37.888 --> 37:39.355
Come on!

38:30.474 --> 38:31.270
Let me try

38:34.679 --> 38:35.441
What are you doing?

38:45.423 --> 38:46.082
Stop it. Don't!

38:53.097 --> 38:55.258
I'm good, I'm good...

39:25.596 --> 39:26.995
I really envy you guys

39:27.398 --> 39:29.866
At least you know where is your root

39:30.901 --> 39:33.495
I don't even know where I come from

39:34.338 --> 39:35.965
The sunshine's beautiful
on this land

39:37.541 --> 39:39.907
but the sunshine is
more beautiful on our land

39:41.379 --> 39:43.006
But, we were forced to leave our home

39:46.417 --> 39:47.543
You don't understand a bit of
what I'm saying

39:48.386 --> 39:50.718
That's fine, at least you are lucky

39:52.456 --> 39:54.890
Unlike me, I keep thinking...

39:54.959 --> 39:56.449
...where I should be heading

39:58.195 --> 39:59.287
I know,

39:59.363 --> 40:02.059
someday I shall return to my land,

40:02.767 --> 40:03.927
to my home

40:19.350 --> 40:21.477
For bleeding for our tribe

40:21.786 --> 40:22.912
Thank you

40:28.993 --> 40:30.654
From now on,
verbal communication is not necessary

40:30.895 --> 40:32.795
Body language is much better, right?

41:07.131 --> 41:09.292
I tried to forget,
but the vision keeps coming back

41:10.468 --> 41:11.230
Damn it!

41:13.571 --> 41:14.902
I must learn to let go

41:16.106 --> 41:16.902
Yellow!

41:24.248 --> 41:24.942
You like it?

41:27.852 --> 41:28.716
Take it!

41:37.461 --> 41:38.826
Fai-hong, have a smoke!

41:41.098 --> 41:44.329
Oh shit!
Aunt Yee is being possessed

41:45.269 --> 41:47.601
Nah, it is not that

41:47.838 --> 41:48.702
What's it then?

41:49.807 --> 41:52.640
Master's stuff reminds her of him

41:53.344 --> 41:54.811
Master?

41:55.379 --> 41:58.177
Though I did not like you to smoke,

42:05.289 --> 42:08.349
it isn't my main concern now

42:47.498 --> 42:49.432
What is taking him so long
to take a shit?

42:50.267 --> 42:51.598
Are you hungry?

42:51.702 --> 42:52.691
Take your shit

44:01.872 --> 44:03.066
Come on...

44:06.910 --> 44:08.207
Come on...

44:11.515 --> 44:12.482
Come on...

44:16.987 --> 44:17.919
Come on...

45:01.799 --> 45:02.993
I think I've seen him before

45:03.967 --> 45:05.764
Let's go

45:09.239 --> 45:12.868
Hey! Look what we got here
We got some rich Indians

45:14.878 --> 45:16.709
Hey, I'm talking to you,
stinking red skin

45:18.449 --> 45:21.418
Why don't you show me and
my boys one of your war dances?

45:22.086 --> 45:23.747
I do not dance for the white man

45:39.002 --> 45:40.469
You're dancing now, ain't you?

45:49.146 --> 45:49.805
Isn't he Fai-hong?

46:46.670 --> 46:47.762
You're a woman?

46:53.544 --> 46:54.442
Why are you following us?

46:56.680 --> 46:57.544
I'm looking for him

46:59.082 --> 47:00.071
Fai-hong!

47:00.184 --> 47:02.049
Fai-hong? Who is Fai-hong?

47:03.086 --> 47:04.075
You are Fai-hong!

47:04.188 --> 47:06.281
Am I? Then who are you?

47:07.191 --> 47:10.786
I am Yee, Aunt Yee, your fiancée!

47:11.228 --> 47:12.195
Since you are my aunt,

47:12.896 --> 47:13.954
how can you be my fiancée as well?

47:15.432 --> 47:16.228
Yellow?

47:18.435 --> 47:19.697
Your name is Yellow?

47:20.337 --> 47:21.531
All the people here call me Yellow

47:35.219 --> 47:36.345
You cannot just grab that!

47:47.731 --> 47:53.636
A, B, C, D, E...

47:57.407 --> 47:58.431
Take it back!

48:02.279 --> 48:03.644
She can't do without the ring,

48:03.814 --> 48:04.974
why wouldn't she want it?

48:13.056 --> 48:16.492
Yellow, that girl knows you,

48:17.194 --> 48:18.354
you must follow her

48:22.232 --> 48:24.359
The darker of your inside is
taking over

48:25.002 --> 48:26.560
That's why I feel sick?

48:26.870 --> 48:28.064
Absolutely

48:28.138 --> 48:30.106
So I must sit under the sun more?

48:30.407 --> 48:35.936
Aunt Yee is making a mess
in Po Chi Lam

48:36.246 --> 48:38.714
Everyone in Po Chi Lam tries to
stay away from her

48:39.483 --> 48:41.075
And you thought
Master had bad temper?

48:41.451 --> 48:44.420
You should check her out now

48:44.922 --> 48:46.617
We haven't seen Chinese women
for ages

48:46.790 --> 48:47.757
How is it when Aunt Yee gets mad?

48:48.158 --> 48:49.523
Sol...

48:50.394 --> 48:51.793
Aunt Yee is making a fuss again

48:52.296 --> 48:53.263
What's the fuss this time?

48:54.364 --> 48:55.262
She is packing up

48:56.266 --> 48:57.733
Aunt Yee, where do you want to go?

48:58.201 --> 48:58.758
Back to China

48:59.202 --> 48:59.827
China?

48:59.937 --> 49:00.904
What?

49:02.039 --> 49:04.064
Prepare a carriage for me,
I am going home

49:04.408 --> 49:05.170
Am I clear?

49:05.709 --> 49:06.835
Yes, of course

49:07.945 --> 49:09.071
Seven, prepare the carriage

49:09.546 --> 49:10.877
Why so?

49:12.115 --> 49:15.676
Aunt Yee is having
odd thinking again

49:15.953 --> 49:19.320
Take her for a walk
around the block,

49:19.489 --> 49:22.185
then tell her she's already home

49:23.527 --> 49:25.119
OK, I get it!

49:25.896 --> 49:26.954
Aunt Yee, shall we?

49:28.098 --> 49:29.258
What are you doing?

49:31.268 --> 49:32.599
You really think I am insane?

49:33.737 --> 49:35.204
I know how to get back to China

49:35.739 --> 49:37.730
It takes 10 days to reach
San Francisco by carriage,

49:37.941 --> 49:39.533
Another six months...

49:39.676 --> 49:40.904
...to Hong Kong by ship

49:41.078 --> 49:43.239
From there it takes 3 days'
on train to Canton,

49:43.447 --> 49:44.641
then again by carriage to Fu Shan

49:44.915 --> 49:47.281
Whatever you say will not change
my decision

49:52.022 --> 49:52.852
Now will you go prepare
the carriage?

49:59.062 --> 49:59.926
Fine

50:00.797 --> 50:02.230
Aunt Yee, we are ready now

50:13.710 --> 50:14.608
Seven

50:14.678 --> 50:16.771
Aunt Yee, this way please...

50:29.593 --> 50:31.356
Aunt Yee,
I have forgotten my luggage,

50:31.528 --> 50:32.392
I must go back

50:32.496 --> 50:34.054
Carry it Sol

50:39.736 --> 50:42.432
Aunt Yee...

50:42.973 --> 50:44.167
Aunt Yee...

50:44.307 --> 50:47.799
Aunt Yee...

50:48.545 --> 50:50.035
Aunt Yee, it's master!

50:50.380 --> 50:52.473
Master...

50:52.916 --> 50:54.440
Aunt Yee, Master...

51:00.891 --> 51:01.880
May I ask...

51:01.925 --> 51:02.687
I accept no explanation from you

51:03.060 --> 51:04.118
Aunt Yee...

51:04.227 --> 51:06.092
I ain't here to explain, I just...

51:06.830 --> 51:08.024
I don't want to hear anything

51:09.833 --> 51:12.165
You happen to know someone
called Sol?

51:12.903 --> 51:14.029
Sol?

51:15.472 --> 51:16.871
What about Wong Fai?
Does it ring the bell?

51:22.012 --> 51:23.343
I go ask her then

51:25.515 --> 51:26.846
Master is teasing us, isn't he?

51:27.050 --> 51:30.747
No... Master seems to have lost
his memory

51:34.591 --> 51:36.684
Piss off! Leave me alone, would you?

51:37.694 --> 51:38.524
You are Aunt Yee right?

51:38.628 --> 51:39.617
I am not!

51:39.696 --> 51:40.594
Do you know Wong Fai then?

51:41.031 --> 51:41.895
Wong... what?

51:51.942 --> 51:52.499
Please stop!

51:53.477 --> 51:54.603
Aunt Yee

51:56.847 --> 51:58.474
I don't give allowance just
because you're a woman

51:59.883 --> 52:00.781
What are you doing?

52:00.917 --> 52:02.908
Checking your pulse

52:05.822 --> 52:07.312
Aunt Yee, Master suffers...

52:07.657 --> 52:08.385
...from loss of memory

52:08.492 --> 52:09.459
So...

52:09.559 --> 52:12.289
He has lost his memory?
What should we do?

52:13.163 --> 52:14.130
Let me try

52:22.139 --> 52:23.367
What are you doing?

52:23.473 --> 52:24.633
I want to show you
Wong's super stance,

52:24.908 --> 52:25.738
No Shadow Kick

52:26.243 --> 52:26.937
Who is Wong Fai-hong?

52:27.344 --> 52:28.572
Sure that was you!

52:28.945 --> 52:31.072
You are one of the 10 Canton Tigers,
coach of the local militia

52:31.281 --> 52:32.714
You live in no. 8,
Sing Nam Street, Fu Shan,

52:32.949 --> 52:34.348
you're a doctor

52:34.384 --> 52:36.352
You give free treatment to the poor,
and teach Chinese Kung-fu

52:36.520 --> 52:37.452
You are the Master of Po Chi Lam,

52:37.554 --> 52:38.646
people's hero,

52:38.755 --> 52:40.450
Wong Fai-hong

52:40.957 --> 52:42.720
What is 10 Canton Tigers?
And coaching for what?

52:42.926 --> 52:44.359
Po Chi Lam?

52:44.494 --> 52:46.189
Free treatment to people?

52:46.329 --> 52:47.387
Kung-fu master?

52:47.564 --> 52:48.428
Master of Po Chi Lam,

52:48.565 --> 52:49.657
people's hero

52:49.733 --> 52:51.257
Wong Fai-hong?

52:53.136 --> 52:54.034
He is Wong Fai-hong?

52:54.838 --> 52:56.465
Notice that...

52:56.606 --> 52:57.834
...we both know this post?

52:59.309 --> 53:01.277
Seven, he forgot who he is

53:01.444 --> 53:02.468
Showing him the post has got no use

53:11.154 --> 53:12.018
Are you alright?

53:12.122 --> 53:13.180
Are you alright, Sol?

53:13.356 --> 53:14.823
Yeah, I'm alright

53:14.891 --> 53:16.358
You must help him regain his memory

53:22.299 --> 53:22.924
You!

53:22.999 --> 53:24.330
Wong Fai-hong,

53:24.367 --> 53:25.834
I, Yim Chun-tung,
will see how good you really are

53:48.258 --> 53:49.452
Ha! With my iron cloth martial arts,

53:49.626 --> 53:50.490
you can't beat me!

54:06.109 --> 54:07.007
Come on!

54:13.984 --> 54:15.474
Thicker! Thicker!

54:27.931 --> 54:29.023
Wong Fai-hong,

54:29.099 --> 54:30.657
You should go for my stomach
not my face!

54:38.308 --> 54:40.868
Wong Fai-hong,
do you remember Na Lan Yuan Shu?

54:43.980 --> 54:44.912
Na Lan Yuan Shu

54:53.823 --> 54:54.721
Na Lan Yuan Shu!

55:04.167 --> 55:05.225
Quit fooling around

55:37.100 --> 55:38.567
Seven!

55:39.969 --> 55:41.300
Follow me!

56:49.038 --> 56:51.165
Master,
why are you getting fired up?

57:03.920 --> 57:05.615
Seven, stop fighting with him!

57:17.100 --> 57:17.691
Seven!

57:18.835 --> 57:19.733
Stop fighting!

57:39.456 --> 57:39.979
Fai-hong!

57:40.156 --> 57:40.986
Yee!

57:42.158 --> 57:43.022
Yee, are you alright?

57:43.460 --> 57:43.983
I am fine

57:45.962 --> 57:46.587
Seven...

57:49.299 --> 57:49.958
I am fine!

57:50.900 --> 57:51.924
Seven

57:52.202 --> 57:53.100
How did you fall so badly?

57:53.770 --> 57:54.600
It wasn't from falling

57:55.038 --> 57:57.336
Master, you hit me!

57:58.208 --> 58:00.073
It's okay now, Seven

58:00.343 --> 58:02.368
The Master is back!

58:12.655 --> 58:13.622
This trip to America...

58:13.923 --> 58:15.083
...is just like a dream

58:16.226 --> 58:18.217
I can do with a dream...

58:19.095 --> 58:20.790
...with an Indian beauty

58:21.331 --> 58:22.229
What?

58:22.866 --> 58:23.833
Only you know the story!

58:27.003 --> 58:28.095
I've just cleaned my face

58:30.139 --> 58:31.299
You can give the ring twice,

58:31.374 --> 58:31.999
but you can't wash your face twice?

58:32.175 --> 58:33.642
Sure, sure

58:34.677 --> 58:36.110
I can't remember anything

58:36.646 --> 58:37.613
I don't understand
what you're talking about

58:38.615 --> 58:39.513
Have you thought of that woman?

58:39.816 --> 58:40.976
I don't have time
to think about woman

58:42.685 --> 58:43.617
Do you miss her?

58:44.754 --> 58:45.880
Well, a little bit

58:47.190 --> 58:48.885
You just said
you haven't thought of woman

58:49.826 --> 58:51.157
Thinking and missing are
two different things

58:52.195 --> 58:53.162
If you don't think of her,
how can you miss her?

58:54.564 --> 58:55.531
But it's the truth

58:57.934 --> 58:59.026
The truth is I don't want to
talk to you anymore

59:02.071 --> 59:04.062
But the one I miss is you

59:05.208 --> 59:06.300
You know...

59:06.376 --> 59:07.843
I can never say
these things out loud

59:13.983 --> 59:14.950
The games are about to start. Hurry!

59:15.218 --> 59:15.980
Master Wong

59:16.119 --> 59:17.313
How's everyone?

59:45.448 --> 59:47.211
Master Wong is here, Uncle Lone,
Master Wong is here

59:47.850 --> 59:49.010
So?

59:49.385 --> 59:50.943
Master Wong doesn't like
people gambling

59:51.321 --> 59:52.811
Let's pack it up and gamble later

59:53.289 --> 59:54.881
No way,

59:55.058 --> 59:56.753
I've just won this game

59:56.926 --> 59:58.052
Hurry up

59:58.227 --> 01:00:00.092
Master is coming!

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:03.822
Have you won?
How much did you bet?

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.295
I want in

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.767
Let's gamble together

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:08.768
Come on!

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.601
Master Wong, you too?

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.240
Come, let me be the House

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:14.908
Come on, come on!

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:15.705
Let's have some larger bets

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:17.311
Really?

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.242
Sure! Bet more!

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:23.542
Okay, if Master Wong wants us to,
we'll bet a little

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:24.954
Master...

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:27.056
Bets down and hands off

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:28.020
You've got nowhere...

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:28.887
...to spend your money anyway

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.118
Why don't you bet it all?

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:36.494
Master Wong, you are our hope,

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.897
you gamble like us,
how can we find a role model?

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.730
We are not used to seeing
you gambling

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.564
Master Wong,
why don't you be your normal self?

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:43.433
We won't gamble anymore...

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:44.866
Today

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.274
Get out of here!

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.106
We understand now

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:52.676
People,

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.417
I thank you all...

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:57.686
...for your concern

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.090
I have something to say

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.859
You came a long way...

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.692
to a foreign place,

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.458
Po Chi Lam was opened
for this reason

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:14.364
"When they leave home, goods are
worth more and people are worth less"

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.473
And you should know who you are

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.073
I don't hope for good business,
that'll require you being ill

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.199
Rather I hope Po Chi Lam...

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:23.005
...help you achieve good health,

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.875
build up a strong body

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.973
Copy the merits of foreigners and
compensate our short-comings

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.209
And shine...

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:31.217
...for the Chinese people

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.087
Simply put,

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.025
you must remember who you are

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:43.295
Today, I would like to stop here,

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.265
thank you for listening

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:52.803
Master Wong, that was a great speech

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:53.940
You're too kind...

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.436
Let's go...

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.204
Sir, take the money,

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.516
it was hard-earned

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:02.779
Master Wong, no more speech please

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:03.846
Bye! Bye!

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.042
Please excuse me...

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.224
Your gold mines dried up

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.027
Yeah

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:17.888
There's still a little matter of
the $ 150,000 loan,

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.026
I've discreetly left off the books

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:21.732
Your can't even meet the payroll
for your coolies

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:26.975
Damn your smell like a pail of dung

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:30.506
Here, try some of these

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:32.780
Maybe it'll help your breath

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.382
Put a $ 100,000 is in the safe

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:41.016
I'll take care of everything else

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.892
What? Another $ 100,000

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:45.724
Do as I say

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:49.257
Keep your faces covered,

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.729
I want your identities kept secret

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:53.933
I'd mark pretty face
on every post office and board...

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.765
besides...

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:58.430
...the Mississippi Hell

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.331
I want to be famous

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:03.075
Shut up!

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.747
I don't give a damn,
let's just do it

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:27.002
Let's do it,
Master Wong won't come this time

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:32.468
Why?

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:33.736
He is real busy. Come on!

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:35.269
I'll be the House
Bet. Bet. Bet

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:39.848
It's pay day!

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.850
Seven,
I'm the 11th child of my family

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:46.548
And I was thinking, if you and
I should open a store together,

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:49.015
we'll call it 7-11

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:55.154
Uncle Han, who is that guy?

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:56.823
He is our foreman,

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.066
and always cheat us

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.560
So what if you can kick real fast?

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.138
Don't forget,
this is a world of guns

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.764
You can't be as fast as a bullet

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:25.424
Have you got the money?

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:26.686
Go on and get out of here

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.367
I thought we had a...

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:34.831
Adios

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:37.631
Hell, that's too easy,

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.864
let's find some real excitement

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.607
When they start to shoot,
that would be exciting

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:36.698
Get back, get out

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:49.039
Billy

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:50.743
What are you doing?

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.204
What do you mean?

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:53.982
Yeah, you're alright

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.912
You alright, Billy?

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:12.562
Half a million dollars?

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.364
"HALF A MILLION ROBBED"

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:16.460
What? We only got $ 100,000!

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:17.629
What happened to the rest of it?

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:20.608
Let's go back and pay the Mayor and
his little town a visit

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:23.935
What about Pete?
He isn't gonna to make it

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:31.177
Adios, Pete!

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:53.499
Watch out!

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:54.334
Master

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:57.441
Master Wong

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:58.736
How's everyone?
How are you?

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.773
Master Wong, is that a new sign?

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.807
Yes

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:03.076
People,

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:04.949
I have something to say today

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:08.455
Master, you have something
to say again?

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.047
Why don't you show us...

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.091
...some fist dance
instead of a speech?

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:11.855
Yeah, come on! Show us

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.188
Show us some fist dance! Come on

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:15.530
You'll get the chance!

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:18.599
Today is the first anniversary of...

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:20.392
the American Po Chi Lam

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:22.595
First of all,

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:25.366
I would like to thank you all
for taking care of my student Sol

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:27.672
Don't mention it,
we are all Chinese!

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:30.435
We should help each other,

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:31.873
right?

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:34.883
People, you've come a long way...

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:36.744
to a foreign place

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:39.986
You should co-operate and
take care of each other

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:42.724
Po Chi Lam was opened...

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:44.554
...for this reason

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:47.729
I don't hope...

01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:49.888
...for good business,

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.869
that'll require you being ill

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:56.162
This is not what I hope for
Instead, I hope that...

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:57.534
The American Po Chi Lam...

01:07:57.673 --> 01:07:59.368
...would become your club house

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:02.201
when you have time,
you can have tea,

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:04.405
chat, and practice Kung-fu here

01:08:05.147 --> 01:08:07.206
Build up a strong body

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:09.444
And come in line...

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:10.779
...with Po Chi Lam's spirit

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:14.181
Hand in hand
we copy foreigners' merits and

01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:15.646
compensate our short-comings

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.715
And shine...

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.393
...for the Chinese people

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.087
That's all

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.139
Come in! Refreshment time!

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.348
Let's go and have some snacks...

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:48.785
Master,

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.615
I think your speech deserved
some applause

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:54.154
Aunt Yee may come...

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:56.557
the timing of Aunt Yee's presence
wasn't right

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:58.359
Timing

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.095
Timing!

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.904
Right!

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:10.540
Make yourself at home,
there's still more...

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:20.116
Welcome... Mr. Mayor,

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.020
gentlemen, we're pretty surprised

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.319
Looks like
you're having a celebration

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.124
Get in there men!

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.406
I reckon you boys have something
to do with the robbery

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:47.611
Search the damn place

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:50.745
No! It's ridiculous!

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:52.285
Quiet!

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:54.784
They said we were involved
in the robbery,

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:55.891
they want to search this place

01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.861
No problem, we are innocent!

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:01.663
Give way,

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.021
let the police do their job

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:05.200
search this place

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:22.810
We've found the money!

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:27.414
What? How can it be?

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:33.560
Look what we have got here

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.559
Arrest every last one
of these Chinese, sons of bitches!

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:48.370
Be careful, Master,
they will shoot!

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:54.810
Move!

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:56.916
We're innocent,

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:58.145
let us out!

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.788
You can't put these people in jail

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.880
They had nothing to do
with the robbery

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.550
You don't tell me what I can and
can't do, Billy!

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:07.361
Now settle down son

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:10.690
Look, I was with Doc Sol and
Seven right before the hold-up

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:11.991
They've been framed

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:14.469
I don't give a damn if you come up
with a hundred reasons

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:16.728
The fact is we found some of
the stolen money...

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:17.929
...in Po Chi Lam

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.936
If the Chinamen didn't take
the money, who did?

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:22.236
Me?

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.908
Maybe it was you Billy!

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.845
No! That's crazy! I shot one of 'em

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:30.785
Maybe you were trying to
throw us off

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:32.714
Maybe you're working with the gang

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:36.656
Easy there, Billy

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:39.986
I wont let you do it

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:41.889
How are you going to stop me?

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.093
I'll kill you

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.270
Are you alright?

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:00.706
I guess someone was quicker
at that time

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:02.682
You're a real friend to the Chinese

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.819
Billy! I appreciate you too!

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:17.523
Settle down. I said settle down

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.872
He said he would get
the best deal for us,

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.441
provided that 7 of us would confess
to the crime,

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.547
If we confess do we go jail?

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:37.977
You can forget jail,

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.648
they are going to hang you

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:43.316
If you don't confess to the crime,
they're going to hang you all

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.754
Remember,

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.761
they found the money
with you Chinese

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.795
No, not all the Chinese,

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:51.592
only the Po Chi Lam people

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:58.866
Uncle Lone is right

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:01.438
This is Po Chi Lam's problem,

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:02.599
nothing to do with you all

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:04.942
Sol, tell the sergeant,

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:06.674
can I take all the responsibility?

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:10.311
No!

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:13.355
You can't confess to the crime alone

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.523
If you are going to be
the first to confess,

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:16.783
I'll be the second

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:17.855
Sol!

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.154
Master my nick name is Seven,

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.226
if I am not the 3rd one,
I will be the 7th one

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:24.159
Fai-hong

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.297
You all stay here, I'll go alone

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:27.695
This is a set up!

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:30.967
Master Wong, you are young
and capable

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.274
Your life should be spared for...

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:34.966
...the good of we Chinese workers

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.705
You've nothing to do
with Po Chi Lam,

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.403
don't get yourself into trouble!

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:43.207
Uncle, we are not telling others the
pathetic tales of the Chinese workers

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:46.354
We want to tell the glorious
history of the Chinese workers

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:50.420
I, Wong Fai-hong,
should stand for all of you

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.058
Who disagrees?

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:53.757
Come with me

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:08.472
Ma'am!

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:13.114
Fai-hong

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:31.257
It's my fault!

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.924
I couldn't imagine that,

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:37.855
the establishment of Po Chi Lam
in the America a year ago,

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.902
would pave the way for tragedy

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:45.073
And I dragged Master down too...

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.868
Uncle Han, are you afraid?

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:55.149
Getting married and working hard,

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:59.877
pretending as emperor at home
but working as slave outside...

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:03.348
That is my life!

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:10.855
Sir, it is our custom,

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:13.263
man would die with a full stomach

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.733
May I feed them?

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:26.046
All the prisoners get their
final meal before they're executed

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.306
What can it hurt?

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:43.122
Master Wong

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:47.901
This is all I can do

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:58.404
Master Wong,
stuffed dumplings for you

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:01.344
Eat!

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:20.527
Master, we all depend on you

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:22.570
Master,
I have full confidence in you

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:30.268
I want more!

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:39.078
They're waiting!

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.094
Go

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:53.892
Go away!

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:11.778
Why were you not in jail...

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:13.221
...with us?

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:15.848
I didn't do anything

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:19.616
I didn't do anything wrong

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:25.131
Citizens,

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:29.131
as Mayor of this town and
in the name of God

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:33.841
I'm here to witness this fair and
just execution of these men

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:37.037
God has decided the day
they are to die

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:40.677
Now I shall decide their hour

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:09.105
Escape!

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:10.041
Move everyone

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:02.124
Up the way

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.987
Look out! Sheriff out of the way,
we have to stop him, boys!

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:32.721
No! No!

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:49.436
Master Wong, that's the robber
That's the ones who robbed the bank

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:53.272
Master, he was the bank robber

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:56.679
I have to get him to clear my name

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.151
Sol, save the others first

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:06.854
Master, leave these two to me

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:13.723
Mayor Barclay

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:18.859
What're the hell you're doing here?

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:20.292
I need the rest of my money

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:24.100
The other Chinese is suspicious
of me

01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:25.865
I think I should leave town

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.807
I agree with you, you'd leave town

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:46.220
What do you want?

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:47.556
I'm just doing business with you

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:49.789
I want my four hundred thousand

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.925
That's the bank's money

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.695
You told me the job was gonna
a cake walk,

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:56.702
but one of my man's been killed

01:22:58.139 --> 01:23:00.369
Sorry,
I've nothing to do with that

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:01.965
It was an accident

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.302
I'm sorry too

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:26.531
Damn it!

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:36.770
Go to hell

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:46.010
What the hell!

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.600
You little bastard,
how did you get there?

01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:27.555
Shit!

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:29.824
What kind of a man is he?!

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:38.088
This is for you!

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.037
Go in

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:06.724
Plays rough!

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:08.624
I like that

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:48.466
You like that

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:50.461
I don't think so

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:55.630
Come on!

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.491
Go, get out...

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:39.899
get out...

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:40.803
God damn it!

01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:44.873
Where are you?

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:49.645
Where are you?

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:02.729
Come on out now,

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:05.599
let's talk about that!

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:12.402
That...

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:31.210
Surrender now!

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.786
You still fight?

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:15.852
What the hell are you?

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:35.979
Hold it tight!

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:40.112
Get off me, I don't need your help!

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:41.682
Come on up!

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:42.880
Come on up. Look out!

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:05.838
I need you to prove my innocence

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:10.150
You're not a human

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:12.244
Get up!

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:27.668
Are you alright?

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:28.959
Why are you guys here?

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:30.671
Oh, Diana!

01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:45.444
Fai-hong, are you alright?

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:46.677
Where do you go?

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:48.250
I get them here to help you!

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:49.553
Who are they?

01:33:49.857 --> 01:33:50.448
They are...

01:33:50.725 --> 01:33:51.885
Forget it

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:52.926
People are hurt
Let's go help them

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:24.283
Seven, get ready for lion dance

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:54.048
Come here!

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:08.658
Congratulations, Billy

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:10.961
I trust you will be a good Mayor

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:13.203
As a new Mayor,

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:16.502
I proclaim in name of friendship and
understanding that from this day on,

01:35:16.711 --> 01:35:20.647
this area of Fort Stockton will be
known as China Town

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:26.787
I know you will be a good leader,

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:27.546
like Lincoln

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.222
Farewell, Yellow

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:34.660
I'm not Yellow

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:37.020
My name is Wong Fai-hong

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:38.490
A name is just a name

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:41.025
You'll always be our brother

01:35:47.174 --> 01:35:48.038
Come on!

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.710
Who are they?

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:55.538
Don't you remember them?

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:09.653
Everyone...

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:11.163
Master Wong, no more speeches!

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:12.595
It's time to get going

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.094
That's right,
if you miss this train,

01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:15.359
you'll miss the boat as well

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:16.501
Now go

01:36:17.071 --> 01:36:17.730
Yeah...

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:19.968
Seven!

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.336
Master,

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.967
didn't you have
a long speech readied?

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:25.112
How come you finish your speech
so soon?

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:30.875
Everyone...

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:32.146
Master Wong, please do go now

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:32.911
Get on the train

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:33.817
Let's go!

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:34.580
See you!

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:35.722
See you...

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:39.882
Here she is!

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:42.456
Master Wong, take care

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:45.298
How are you doing?

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:48.329
Who is that woman?

01:36:51.505 --> 01:36:52.904
People say she's Uncle Lone's wife

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:54.767
Where the hell is it?

01:36:54.909 --> 01:36:55.876
It's far from home!

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:57.741
It's a nice place
It's a nice place!

01:36:57.912 --> 01:36:58.537
Right!

01:36:58.612 --> 01:36:59.840
I am tired!

01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:00.812
I'll need at least 3 days' rest
before I can take care of you

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:02.109
No problem. As you wish

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:04.515
Why are they so happy?

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:07.587
Happy!

01:37:07.888 --> 01:37:09.150
No more than 10 people per day,

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:10.518
and I break on the 1st and 15th

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:14.583
You really don't remember
the Indian woman?

01:37:17.631 --> 01:37:18.859
No, I remember nothing!

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:26.873
See you!

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:30.870
No need to see me off, Sol,

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:32.008
go tend to the store

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:33.441
Good bye!
