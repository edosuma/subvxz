WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:11.714
(train roaring)

00:38.915 --> 00:39.950
TRICK: What's this about?

00:40.166 --> 00:42.157
Time.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.536
It's about time.

00:43.753 --> 00:45.334
I am Dark.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.707
l was taken by the Wanderer.

00:47.924 --> 00:50.210
And I don't know who
he is or what happened

00:50.426 --> 00:53.293
when I was with him
and I don't like it one bit.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.757
So...

00:55.973 --> 00:58.760
I'm gonna get to the bottom
of this once and for all.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.011
Thank you, Kenzi.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.934
You got it, 30-30.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.761
Starting...

01:13.115 --> 01:14.696
With this.

01:17.495 --> 01:18.780
Are you out of your mind?

01:18.996 --> 01:20.372
Trick, back off--

01:20.581 --> 01:21.821
Okay, just wait a
minute Patty Hurst,

01:22.041 --> 01:22.951
is that not
the same black smoke

01:23.167 --> 01:25.453
that took you from this
shithole in the first place?

01:25.670 --> 01:26.375
Kenz, if you have a Hel-Shoe

01:26.587 --> 01:28.452
in your boot
collection, now's the time--

01:28.673 --> 01:30.038
I'm taking it back--
I want it back!

01:30.258 --> 01:31.714
Kenzi. It is her decision.

01:31.926 --> 01:32.506
Thank you.

01:32.718 --> 01:33.548
I actually agree--

01:33.761 --> 01:34.841
What?!

01:36.305 --> 01:36.839
Thank you.

01:37.056 --> 01:37.681
Which is why...

01:37.890 --> 01:39.551
...we need to
stand by her now

01:39.767 --> 01:41.348
and help her
face this Wanderer.

01:41.560 --> 01:41.810
Together--

01:42.019 --> 01:43.008
Yes, but--

01:43.229 --> 01:44.890
| feel like I'm in a
room full of children.

01:45.106 --> 01:45.686
Guys! Please!

01:45.898 --> 01:46.978
She could be taken. Again.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.477
Lost. And we might
not get her back this time.

01:49.694 --> 01:50.524
Damn it, people.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.317
If she opens that jar,
she could also--

01:52.530 --> 01:53.861
Not happening!

01:54.073 --> 01:55.358
Kenzi! You give
that back now.

01:55.574 --> 01:58.111
No, I'm not just gonna sit
back and have you taken again.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.407
I said give it back!

01:59.620 --> 01:59.949
Eugh!

02:00.162 --> 02:02.448
lsabeau!

02:05.001 --> 02:07.834
Don't you see what
is happening to me?

02:08.045 --> 02:10.297
Not knowing is
driving me crazy.

02:10.506 --> 02:11.131
I'm sorry.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.716
But this has to end now...

02:15.928 --> 02:17.634
Oh, what the hell.

02:24.979 --> 02:25.513
Ah.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.220
Trickster you okay?

02:41.329 --> 02:43.365
Friend or foe, pal?

02:43.581 --> 02:47.665
By the look 0' you lot, I'd
say you were betting on foe.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.758
Life is hard when you
don ’t know who you are.

02:54.967 --> 02:58.175
It’s harder when you
don ’t know what you are.

02:58.387 --> 03:01.220
My love carries
a death sentence.

03:01.432 --> 03:06.222
I was lost for years...
Searching, while hiding.

03:06.437 --> 03:10.350
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.022
I won 't hide anymore.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.691
I will live the life I choose.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.985
My name is Hugin and I
am the most humble servant

03:24.205 --> 03:25.240
of the Wanderer.

03:25.456 --> 03:26.696
And for the time being--

03:26.916 --> 03:28.326
I mean you no harm.

03:29.752 --> 03:32.289
My. My. Aren't you
a pretty little thing.

03:32.505 --> 03:35.042
(giggles)

03:35.257 --> 03:36.292
Thanks.

03:43.307 --> 03:46.049
I am, or at least have been,
the Wanderer's thought.

03:46.268 --> 03:49.305
A vessel really traveling
from plane to plane gathering

03:49.522 --> 03:52.855
information about
certain women--

03:53.067 --> 03:54.307
We've met. Haven't we?

03:54.527 --> 03:55.607
Yes.

03:55.820 --> 03:58.152
My brother, Munin and
I took you from this...

03:58.364 --> 04:00.776
...shithole and brought
you to his train.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.276
Our father's train.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.700
So it was written--
so it was said.

04:04.912 --> 04:05.742
Father?

04:05.955 --> 04:07.195
Yes. The Wanderer
is a great man.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.655
And a father to many.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.456
If he's such a great man
why doesn't he show his face?

04:11.669 --> 04:13.751
Why does he hide behind
cheap lies and theatrics?

04:13.963 --> 04:15.703
Hmm. I really don't know.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.209
But perhaps you can
tell me why the Blood King

04:18.426 --> 04:21.418
has to hide behind a bar
at a local watering hole?

04:21.637 --> 04:23.218
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.217
Oh, dear. (tisks)

04:25.433 --> 04:26.889
Your poker face is lousy.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.513
But then again,
it always was.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.717
My liege.

04:30.938 --> 04:31.893
Hey!

04:32.106 --> 04:34.768
Focus. I need to
get back on that train.

04:34.984 --> 04:35.769
Well join the club.

04:35.985 --> 04:36.599
Where is it?

04:36.819 --> 04:37.604
I haven't the foggiest.

04:37.820 --> 04:38.525
Bullshit.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.238
I assure you. I do not lie.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.030
My brother Munin trapped me
in that jar just as soon as you

04:43.242 --> 04:45.779
got on the train.
Where it is now, I know not.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.075
Brother didn't
like your jokes?

04:47.288 --> 04:49.074
Didn't like the fact
my wife wasn't his.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.826
Ah. So where are they now?

04:51.041 --> 04:51.496
Honeymoon?

04:51.709 --> 04:53.199
One could only hope.

04:53.419 --> 04:54.955
I need to get back there.

04:55.171 --> 04:55.660
Now.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.370
And I will help you.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.377
But only if you help me take
revenge against my back-stabbing

05:00.593 --> 05:03.209
brother and that repulsive
quim | used to call my wife.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.260
Munin will know the
location of that train.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.303
Waitin' on you pal.

05:06.515 --> 05:07.174
Yeah, let's go.

05:07.391 --> 05:07.800
I'm ready.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.223
Oh, no, no, no.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.596
We go alone or
we don't go at all.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.222
Well that's not
gonna work for us.

05:13.439 --> 05:14.929
Where she goes, we go.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.891
Then I will take my leave.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.020
What? No wait!

05:19.236 --> 05:20.692
Just wait.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.026
I love you both.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.531
So much.

05:30.748 --> 05:36.288
But right now I need you
to watch me walk away.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.870
Because I have to do this.

05:43.427 --> 05:49.423
It's never gonna
get easier is it?

05:57.149 --> 05:58.013
I'm ready.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.519
Excellent.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.101
Oh, and um by the way when
we do get on the train--

06:02.321 --> 06:04.687
if I happen to find out that
you're an enemy of my employer

06:04.907 --> 06:06.443
I will flay you to his liking.

06:06.659 --> 06:08.195
Oh! I knew it!

06:08.410 --> 06:09.911
So nice meeting you all.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.200
Ta!

06:19.797 --> 06:21.378
What did I miss?

06:46.490 --> 06:48.401
What took you so long?

06:48.617 --> 06:50.994
l was getting
my science stuff--

06:53.247 --> 06:55.989
(laughs)

06:56.208 --> 06:58.665
You got your weapons,
and your wolf,

06:58.877 --> 07:01.209
and I've got my brains
and we both have...

07:03.257 --> 07:05.248
Let's just go
get our girl. Ok?

07:05.467 --> 07:06.297
You're um--

07:06.510 --> 07:08.671
I am ready to kick
some crow ass. Yes.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.720
l was going to say terrifying
but yeah, that'll do.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.178
Here.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.598
I know you have your
brains and your science,

07:21.817 --> 07:25.651
but it would make me feel
better if you also had a knife.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.897
Thank you, Dyson.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.028
You're welcome, Dr. Lewis.

07:35.456 --> 07:38.619
You know? I'm not
sure if I could either.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.040
What?

07:41.587 --> 07:43.248
Choose.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.546
I could.

07:46.759 --> 07:48.590
(laughs)

07:48.802 --> 07:50.383
Yeah...

07:52.264 --> 07:53.595
Let's do this.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.107
Trickster, why are you
PMS-ing over that gorgeous,

08:09.323 --> 08:11.063
smoky, crowy,
ass-face, hot, jerk?

08:11.283 --> 08:12.864
I don't know what
your talking about.

08:13.077 --> 08:14.863
We don't believe you.

08:15.079 --> 08:18.321
I'm sorry weren't you once
an employee of the Wanderer?

08:18.540 --> 08:21.122
Eh, eh, eh, we're not
here to talk about Tamsin!

08:21.335 --> 08:22.450
Okay?

08:22.670 --> 08:23.580
l have to go--

08:23.796 --> 08:25.502
Look, come on, you're
our Trick-o-pedia!

08:25.714 --> 08:26.624
You gotta know something.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.000
You're freakin' Yoda.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.173
Force must use to
problem answer find!

08:30.386 --> 08:31.045
Yes?

08:31.261 --> 08:32.341
I don't have time for this.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.090
Oh, I'm sorry,
you don't have time?

08:34.306 --> 08:36.388
I'm sorry but you
have not done one thing

08:36.600 --> 08:38.386
to help Bo since
the Wanderer took her!

08:38.602 --> 08:39.887
I want the old Trick back.

08:40.104 --> 08:41.890
The one that knows things
and cares about people

08:42.106 --> 08:43.892
and why haven't you
figured this out yet?!

08:44.108 --> 08:46.941
I don't have time to
explain myself to a human...

08:47.152 --> 08:48.733
and a lowlife...

08:53.242 --> 08:56.700
I'm sorry. Just leave it be.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.322
I'm begging you.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.292
He really is hiding
something. |sn't he?

09:05.504 --> 09:07.165
Certainly looks that way.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.383
Well, there's only
one thing left to do.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.877
Take a dump on his bed.

09:12.094 --> 09:12.583
No!

09:12.803 --> 09:16.136
l was gonna say. Ew!

09:16.348 --> 09:17.212
I'm sorry.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.219
What do you wanna do?

09:19.435 --> 09:19.969
Snoop.

09:20.185 --> 09:20.844
Look around his place...

09:21.061 --> 09:23.723
not... you know.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.475
Okay, we'll snoop.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.223
Okay...

09:37.536 --> 09:40.073
Please be careful not to
step on top of the graves.

09:40.289 --> 09:41.620
This is a Fae burial ground.

09:41.832 --> 09:42.787
Meaning?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.740
Meaning you put so
much as a pinky on top

09:44.960 --> 09:46.245
of one of these sacred plots

09:46.462 --> 09:48.578
you'll be sucked down
to lrkalla by the Leviathan.

09:48.797 --> 09:49.957
lrkaHa?

09:50.174 --> 09:52.381
Yes. Some call it hell,
some call it the netherworld,

09:52.593 --> 09:53.878
I call it France.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.044
Hmph. Usually
kills in Britain.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.549
What are we
doing here, Hugin?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.552
My brother and
| used to live here.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.554
We crows are always more
comfortable around death,

10:02.770 --> 10:04.635
travelling as we do between

10:04.855 --> 10:06.516
the living world
and the afterlife.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.690
To us... it's quite homey.

10:09.902 --> 10:13.190
Well, I guess it
does have a certain...

10:13.405 --> 10:14.611
No, this place sucks.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.280
Let's just get what we came
for and get out of here.

10:17.493 --> 10:24.706
(crow cawing)

10:31.089 --> 10:32.078
Hello, brother.

10:38.263 --> 10:41.050
'Allo, 'allo, 'allo!

10:43.852 --> 10:46.229
What a pleasant surprise.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.518
Pleasant? Really?

10:47.731 --> 10:48.891
Yeah. Pleasant.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.689
Like being eaten by dogs
or having your knuckles

10:51.902 --> 10:55.144
rapped by a nun for
horsin' about in class.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.649
That kind of pleasant.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.651
He's a poet my brother.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.859
Dumb as dog shite but
a poet none-the-less.

11:02.079 --> 11:02.613
Shall we?

11:02.830 --> 11:03.694
Oh, yes, please.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.405
Caw! Caw! Caw!

11:06.625 --> 11:09.867
(crow caws)

11:14.466 --> 11:15.797
One for sorrow.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.387
Two for mirth.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.430
Three for a funeral.

11:24.643 --> 11:25.632
Four for birth.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.808
Five for heaven.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.601
Six for hell.

11:28.814 --> 11:33.148
And seven is the
devil... his own self.

11:33.569 --> 11:34.524
Excellent.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.989
'Cause I like them odds.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.206
Hello, Hugin.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.578
My little treasure.

11:50.794 --> 11:51.374
Hello, darling.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.793
So nice to see you.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.291
Can't tell you how much
I'm going to enjoy eating

11:55.507 --> 11:58.044
the heart right
out of your chest.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.626
If you had been better at eating
certain things when we were

12:00.846 --> 12:04.259
together I never would have
left you for your brother.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.634
(sighs)

12:05.851 --> 12:09.560
Not hard to see who got
the passion in that family.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.022
|t's Munin.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.350
He got the passion.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.316
Let me guess.

12:13.525 --> 12:13.854
The wife?

12:14.067 --> 12:14.601
Yeah.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.228
Isn't she a peach.

12:19.740 --> 12:20.855
Shall we run?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.029
Why not?

12:32.127 --> 12:32.957
Ergh!

12:33.170 --> 12:34.205
Books.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.536
Old books.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.496
More old books...
older than the other books.

12:37.716 --> 12:38.080
Oh!

12:38.300 --> 12:39.050
Look at this.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.875
It's another
old book that is...

12:42.095 --> 12:42.959
Blank.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.215
What did you say?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.217
What about the books?
Or the more old books?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.424
About the blank.

12:48.644 --> 12:49.474
Yeah. This one here.

12:49.686 --> 12:50.061
Em pty.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.771
Nothing doing.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.936
Oh my god. This is it.

12:54.149 --> 12:54.899
What?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.848
This is what we have to do.

12:57.069 --> 12:59.401
Oh like, you mean, draw
weird dicks in there.

12:59.613 --> 13:00.773
No.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.024
Look, after Bo's fight with
her mother, with Aife...

13:02.240 --> 13:03.776
I found Trick
passed out down here.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.857
Near death. He was
writing in this book.

13:06.078 --> 13:07.238
With his own blood.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.617
He opened his veins and
rewrote the future to save Bo.

13:10.832 --> 13:11.457
Heavy.

13:11.667 --> 13:12.747
Yeah. Real heavy.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.871
|t unleashed a shitstorm
by the name of the Garuda.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.247
|t's before your time.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.999
Okay! Don't you think
messing with Blood writings

13:18.215 --> 13:19.796
is a bad idea? Even for us.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.623
No, the way Trick reacted
to that Crow's smoke?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.128
What it did to him?

13:23.345 --> 13:24.926
l have a feeling
in my gut that

13:25.138 --> 13:26.423
he's wrapped
up in all of this.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.221
He has kept things
from Bo before.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.719
So I think that the
answers lie in this book

13:30.936 --> 13:32.221
in his past.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.723
Or his future I guess.

13:34.940 --> 13:35.770
But, Kenz--

13:35.983 --> 13:37.348
Look, Bo has always
had my back, Tammy.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.068
She has saved my
life countless times.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.984
Even from the minute
she didn't know me.

13:42.197 --> 13:45.781
I think it's time
I had hers. You know?

13:47.244 --> 13:49.405
Okay.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.861
I'm in.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.867
What next?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.540
Well, uh we need
some of Trick's blood.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.128
Oh, well that's good.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.202
'Cause I thought it
was gonna be difficult.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.538
Yeah. He told me once
that back in the day

14:00.757 --> 14:02.622
he would store his
blood in an ink well,

14:02.843 --> 14:05.334
ready to write
at a moments notice.

14:05.554 --> 14:06.589
You think it's in here?

14:06.805 --> 14:08.591
Well he's a creature
of habit, our Trick.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.638
It is definitely in
here. And knowing him...

14:10.851 --> 14:13.183
it's not going to
be easy or safe to find.

14:13.395 --> 14:13.554
Great.

14:13.770 --> 14:14.680
Yeah.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.271
Fitzy.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.523
Is that you?

14:24.740 --> 14:25.900
Dao-ming.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.481
What a nice surprise.

14:27.701 --> 14:28.986
(chuckles)

14:29.202 --> 14:32.365
Are you really going to stand
there and lie to a Luduan?

14:32.581 --> 14:34.867
I suppose not.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.414
I'm looking for your sister.

14:36.626 --> 14:37.706
Oh?

14:37.919 --> 14:41.707
Have you come
to win her back?

14:41.923 --> 14:43.129
You know why I'm here.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.468
I'm not a
mind reader, Fitzy.

14:45.677 --> 14:48.965
just a simple Fae
that can find the truth.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.888
Even in the most...

14:52.100 --> 14:55.012
formidable of opponents.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.480
| no longer live as Royalty.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.190
I meant men.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.388
Liars.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.395
Every last one of you.

15:02.611 --> 15:03.896
I need answers, Ming.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.101
Now.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.193
So sorry, Wai Lin
is away helping

15:12.412 --> 15:16.405
with some very important
international negotiations.

15:16.625 --> 15:17.956
She's back at the UN?

15:18.168 --> 15:20.580
Facebook.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.377
The world has changed.

15:22.589 --> 15:26.502
What can I say, Barkeep?

15:28.637 --> 15:29.251
Help me.

15:29.471 --> 15:30.631
No.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.428
Why?

15:32.641 --> 15:34.097
Because I don't feel like it.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.721
Besides, you've
wanted answers before.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.394
Not sure it did
you much good.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.688
There's a memory.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.811
It has been blocked
by someone very powerful.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.564
And you think if I force
you to tell the truth,

15:46.780 --> 15:48.691
this memory will just
poke its little head

15:48.907 --> 15:49.771
back into the light?

15:49.991 --> 15:50.776
Yes.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.698
Why?

15:52.911 --> 15:53.991
l have money--

15:54.204 --> 15:55.740
Why should I help you
after everything you've

15:55.956 --> 15:56.786
done to my family?!

15:56.998 --> 15:58.863
Because.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.370
You hate the person
who's blocked this memory.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.453
And who might that be?

16:04.673 --> 16:06.379
Me.

16:06.591 --> 16:09.298
I think I
did this to myself.

16:09.511 --> 16:16.178
Now... this is interesting.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.677
No magic herbs, Ming?

16:23.567 --> 16:25.432
I thought they helped
you Luduan's engage

16:25.652 --> 16:26.858
the realm of truth.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.651
Pfft.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.775
Antiquated parlor tricks.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.982
Hardly worth it these days.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.192
Have you seen
my sisters teeth?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.327
I will help.

16:41.543 --> 16:42.532
Thank you.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.209
On one condition.

16:45.422 --> 16:46.457
Name it.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.914
| get to ask you
any question I want

16:49.134 --> 16:51.546
and you must let
me get the truth.

16:51.761 --> 16:55.299
No matter how painful.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.094
Fine.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.551
For my granddaughter's safety

17:00.770 --> 17:02.476
I give you my blood oath.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.475
Excellent. First question.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.521
Shoot

17:05.734 --> 17:07.895
Why did you pick
my sister over me?

17:08.111 --> 17:09.692
Oh boy.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.735
Ok. Looks like we're
gonna have to do this

17:14.951 --> 17:17.033
the old fashioned way
and fight our way out.

17:17.245 --> 17:18.075
You ready?

17:18.288 --> 17:20.904
Succubus, l was born ready.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.210
Whoa! What are you doing?

17:27.422 --> 17:28.537
I'm sorry.

17:28.757 --> 17:29.792
But, ever since my father--

17:30.008 --> 17:31.293
He who Wanders!

17:31.509 --> 17:33.545
(crowd laughs)

17:33.762 --> 17:35.127
Ever since, he who Wanders,

17:35.347 --> 17:37.679
banished me to
that jar, well you know,

17:37.891 --> 17:39.882
l've kind of
grown to hate him.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.966
So, you and the wife--

17:42.187 --> 17:44.394
Very much in love I'm afraid.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.602
Your boss is the
one who screwed you over.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.608
What does this
have to do with me?

17:54.824 --> 17:57.657
It seems you are of
particular interest to our

17:57.869 --> 17:59.575
decaying former employer.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.200
So I thought
my brother and |--

18:02.415 --> 18:04.030
Would slit your throat.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.287
(laughs)

18:06.503 --> 18:07.709
Oh.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.661
So why the charade?

18:09.881 --> 18:13.794
Well, it's hardly any fun
killing someone outright--

18:14.010 --> 18:15.875
No thrill? No chase?

18:16.096 --> 18:17.176
It'd be like the King,

18:17.389 --> 18:19.425
just shooting the fox
in the head point blank.

18:19.641 --> 18:20.721
Where's the fun in that?

18:20.934 --> 18:21.969
Better to release the hounds

18:22.185 --> 18:23.516
and make a game of it.

18:23.728 --> 18:24.717
Yeah and besides

18:24.938 --> 18:27.896
I do like seeing the
expression change

18:28.108 --> 18:30.599
when they know they've
just been double-crossed.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.855
Mmm really gets
the blood pumping.

18:33.071 --> 18:36.029
|t warms the
cockles of my heart.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.152
(laughs)

18:38.368 --> 18:40.700
Well, then I'll enjoy seeing
the looks on your faces

18:40.912 --> 18:41.697
when l disappoint you.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.414
Oh.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.365
And how exactly is
that going to happen, eh?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.370
You're trapped.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.918
Surrounded.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.918
Yeah, you're right.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.547
But nobody is
slitting my throat today

18:57.762 --> 18:59.502
or any time soon.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.548
(schwoo p)

19:05.437 --> 19:07.803
Hmm...

19:08.023 --> 19:09.638
I did not see that coming.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.562
Ugh.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.404
Well that sucked.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.282
Ah.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.453
Who's there?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.408
VOICE: (mocking) Who's there?

19:29.627 --> 19:33.085
Both brown and blue.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.128
Hello?

19:34.341 --> 19:37.083
Both brown and blue!

19:37.302 --> 19:40.260
Strong yet gentle...

19:40.472 --> 19:42.258
I don't have time
for games, lady.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.760
Virtuous yet lustful!

19:44.976 --> 19:45.840
Show yourself!

19:46.061 --> 19:47.221
(mocking) Show yourself!

19:47.437 --> 19:53.182
I know you! I know you!

19:56.613 --> 19:57.978
I know you.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.906
I'm pretty
popular these days.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.528
Let me guess.

20:03.745 --> 20:04.450
The Leviathan?

20:04.662 --> 20:05.651
Your soul--

20:09.542 --> 20:11.578
(screams)

20:12.253 --> 20:14.164
What the hell?

20:14.381 --> 20:16.337
Where did you get that mark?!

20:16.549 --> 20:19.586
Oh you mean the hand
hickey on my chest?

20:19.803 --> 20:23.591
Some guy on a train...
I had a lot to drink...

20:23.807 --> 20:25.092
The more important
question is

20:25.308 --> 20:28.425
where the hell is the
door to this place, lady?

20:28.645 --> 20:34.686
l have been searching for that
mark for six hundred years.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.142
It was supposed to be mine.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.318
And they kept it from me.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.067
I want it!

20:41.282 --> 20:43.238
I need it!

20:46.371 --> 20:48.737
You want and need this mark.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.744
I want and need back
to that graveyard.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.703
No one ever leaves
here, child. (laughs)

20:55.922 --> 20:59.130
No one has ever left.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.207
Now give me that mark!

21:01.428 --> 21:02.964
You want it?

21:03.179 --> 21:04.760
Come and get it.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.760
I'd just as soon stop screwing
around and fight for it anyway.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.762
It's a little more my style.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.388
Excellent.

21:11.604 --> 21:15.096
A game of riddles then it is.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.817
Riddles?

21:17.861 --> 21:20.227
There's no Angry
Birds in lrkalla?

21:20.447 --> 21:21.857
Do you agree?

21:22.073 --> 21:23.609
I don't suppose
you'd care to haggle.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.065
Do you agree?!

21:25.285 --> 21:26.400
Okay, yes.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.823
Yes, I agree.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.416
Excellent.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.580
(laughs)

21:34.961 --> 21:36.917
When did you first use your
blood to change history?

21:37.130 --> 21:40.338
I don't know...
I don't remember...

21:40.550 --> 21:41.414
(clicks)

21:41.634 --> 21:43.090
The Damghan Earthquake.

21:43.303 --> 21:46.010
The Damghan leaders
became defiant,

21:46.222 --> 21:49.305
and unruly, they needed
to be taught a lesson.

21:49.517 --> 21:50.848
How many did it kill?

21:51.060 --> 21:51.810
(clicks)

21:52.020 --> 21:53.931
Over 200,000 souls.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.138
It was a massacre.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.188
But it prevented
a larger massacre.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.390
A genocide--

21:59.611 --> 22:01.226
How many souls have you
wiped from this earth?

22:01.446 --> 22:01.901
(clicks)

22:02.113 --> 22:03.193
Millions! But--

22:03.406 --> 22:05.067
Who do you love most?

22:05.283 --> 22:05.692
lsabeau.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.149
You know that.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.154
Tell me the truth!

22:09.370 --> 22:10.746
I am--

22:10.955 --> 22:11.535
Who?

22:11.748 --> 22:12.612
(clicks)

22:12.832 --> 22:14.288
Me! I am the first
son of this earth.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.082
I am the one
to be worshipped!

22:16.294 --> 22:20.333
(grunts in pain)

22:20.548 --> 22:22.539
l'm... I'm not
going to continue.

22:22.759 --> 22:23.999
Ming, please.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.084
Whatever is buried in there
does not want to come out.

22:26.304 --> 22:26.668
But--

22:26.888 --> 22:30.801
I am frightened, Fitzy. l'm
frightened of what it could be.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.882
What it could mean...
for all of us.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.593
Bo's life is in danger.

22:35.813 --> 22:39.101
She's all l have
left of my line.

22:39.317 --> 22:42.684
Ming, you have
to continue, please.

22:42.904 --> 22:45.190
I beg of you.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.114
So be it.

22:50.954 --> 22:55.994
lam black as night
and as bright as day,

22:56.209 --> 23:00.418
as cold as March
and as warm as May.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.666
What am |?

23:03.466 --> 23:05.297
You're um...

23:18.565 --> 23:21.272
Yes, what am |?

23:23.194 --> 23:24.309
Fog?

23:26.281 --> 23:27.396
You're fog, right?

23:27.615 --> 23:28.445
That's the answer.

23:28.658 --> 23:29.773
Eugh!

23:31.494 --> 23:33.200
Your turn, Princess.

23:33.413 --> 23:36.200
Oh, not big on
losing, huh Levi?

23:39.210 --> 23:41.246
The game is not over yet.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.872
And don't call me that.

23:43.089 --> 23:43.589
Go!

23:43.798 --> 23:45.880
Okay, okay, I'm going.

23:51.764 --> 23:52.924
It's not here.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.256
Keep looking.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.136
We've been looking for hours.

23:56.352 --> 23:57.637
It's not here.

23:57.854 --> 23:58.559
(floor creaks)

23:58.771 --> 24:00.102
Gross, Tamsin!

24:00.315 --> 24:02.647
It was the floor!

24:02.859 --> 24:05.896
(creaking)

24:17.457 --> 24:19.072
What is that?

24:19.959 --> 24:20.744
This can't be.

24:20.960 --> 24:21.915
What?!

24:22.503 --> 24:24.084
It's a Tametebako.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.252
A tomato-bacon!

24:25.465 --> 24:26.671
Yum!

24:26.883 --> 24:29.215
Ah, no.

24:29.427 --> 24:30.792
This is a
Japanese folding box.

24:31.012 --> 24:33.549
These markings--
but this is impossible.

24:33.765 --> 24:36.302
Fill a brother in, Tam-tam.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.257
|n fifth century
Japan a fisherman,

24:38.478 --> 24:40.434
Urashima Taro, met a turtle--

24:40.647 --> 24:42.228
I've met turtles.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.725
No.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.068
This turtle was the cursed
daughter of an Emperor.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.313
She gave the
fisherman a magical box,

24:48.529 --> 24:49.314
if I'm not mistaken,

24:49.530 --> 24:50.906
it is this magical box.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.400
Like, make a
wish, magical box

24:52.617 --> 24:56.781
or just like have a
late period, magical box?

24:56.996 --> 24:59.282
Like protect you from
evil but don't you dare open

24:59.499 --> 25:01.285
it unless you know the
combination magical box.

25:01.501 --> 25:02.581
It opens from all sides.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.659
But the combinations
are endless.

25:04.879 --> 25:07.086
Hm. Well if I
was the Blood King--

25:07.298 --> 25:10.916
This is where I'd
hide my blood, yeah.

25:11.135 --> 25:14.298
Tammy, this may be the single
most irresponsible, frightening

25:14.514 --> 25:16.254
thing we've ever done.

25:16.474 --> 25:17.930
More irresponsible than
the time we snuck into the

25:18.142 --> 25:19.427
Fae Veterans Hospital,
switched the charts

25:19.644 --> 25:21.259
because you were
having period cramps--

25:21.479 --> 25:24.846
Shh! We said we would never
talk of that again. But, yes!

25:27.151 --> 25:28.891
Let's totally do it.

25:29.112 --> 25:29.897
Ag reed!

25:32.281 --> 25:36.524
I grow weary of
your stalling, princess.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.030
I said stop calling me that.

25:39.247 --> 25:41.078
And I'm not stalling.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.906
|just haven't played a
lot of riddle games, is all.

25:44.127 --> 25:45.913
They're not really a thing.

25:46.129 --> 25:47.994
They're kind of old
fashioned... sort of like,

25:48.214 --> 25:49.203
everything about you.

25:49.424 --> 25:51.130
Don't you mock me!

25:51.342 --> 25:52.843
Yeah, yeah...

25:58.015 --> 26:03.510
Okay. I've got one.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.973
She's brilliant.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.399
He's strong.

26:10.611 --> 26:16.823
Her life is little,
his life is long.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.070
Both loves are pure,

26:19.287 --> 26:26.875
both loves are true,
if you were I,

26:27.086 --> 26:28.667
who would you choose?

26:30.798 --> 26:35.542
Who would I choose?

26:35.762 --> 26:38.879
What... What do you mean?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.258
Choose?

26:40.475 --> 26:42.181
As in choice?

26:42.393 --> 26:43.473
This is a trick!

26:43.686 --> 26:46.098
Oh lady, it is annoying.

26:46.314 --> 26:49.181
Hell, at times it is
emotionally crippling,

26:49.400 --> 26:50.515
but if it's a trick?

26:50.735 --> 26:53.727
Then someone up there has
quite the sense of humour.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.106
Now answer the riddle, Levi.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.233
This isn't fair!

26:56.449 --> 26:58.735
What are you gonna cry?

26:58.951 --> 26:59.781
l'm warning you--

26:59.994 --> 27:01.530
Answer it!

27:01.746 --> 27:02.735
The man!

27:02.955 --> 27:03.910
He will live longer--

27:04.123 --> 27:06.159
Final answer?

27:06.375 --> 27:07.626
No... wait.

27:07.835 --> 27:08.665
Um...

27:08.878 --> 27:10.084
Ah...

27:10.296 --> 27:10.921
Um...

27:11.130 --> 27:12.085
The woman.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.334
Uh, yes you love her.

27:14.550 --> 27:17.883
You wear her
humanity like a shield.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.757
So we're stickin'
with the woman, Levi?

27:20.973 --> 27:27.094
No, um, wait uh... the man.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.975
Yes, you crave strength.

27:30.191 --> 27:30.600
The man.

27:30.817 --> 27:31.977
I answer the man.

27:35.446 --> 27:35.684
Oh!

27:35.905 --> 27:36.690
Damn you!

27:36.906 --> 27:38.487
Too bad, so sad.

27:38.699 --> 27:40.280
Now send me
back up, fish fingers.

27:40.493 --> 27:41.357
Was it the woman?

27:41.577 --> 27:42.532
I must know.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.906
Hey, I was kind of
hoping you could tell me

27:45.122 --> 27:47.408
because as far as I know,
there is no answer.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.490
You cheated!

27:49.710 --> 27:50.790
Uh, no.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.664
l Bo'd it.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.257
And yes, that
is trademarked.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.707
I will make
you pay for this.

27:57.927 --> 27:59.667
Why are you so grumpy?

27:59.887 --> 28:02.003
I'll send you down
a snack, I promise.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.054
Now up!

28:04.267 --> 28:06.724
Very well.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.551
(laughs)

28:08.771 --> 28:10.477
Something funny, Levi?

28:10.690 --> 28:15.730
I will see you
again, soon enough.

28:15.945 --> 28:17.560
What do you mean?

28:20.074 --> 28:25.694
Someone you love very
much will soon be dead.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.449
What?!

28:27.665 --> 28:29.155
Wait! Who?!

28:45.933 --> 28:46.888
Munin?

28:47.101 --> 28:48.557
Yes, Hugin?

28:48.769 --> 28:51.852
What part of being rich will you
like best once The Wanderer has

28:52.064 --> 28:53.895
fallen into the abyss
with his pathetic choochoo

28:54.108 --> 28:56.941
and we collect all of the riches
we've hidden about the world?

28:57.153 --> 28:58.734
Well, I will tell you, see...

28:58.946 --> 29:01.483
(sighs) My soul is
saying world domination,

29:01.699 --> 29:05.908
but there are other parts
of me that are saying

29:06.120 --> 29:07.985
a different
woman every night!

29:08.205 --> 29:10.582
(laughs)

29:10.791 --> 29:11.576
Agh!

29:11.792 --> 29:12.121
(SCHWOOP)

29:12.335 --> 29:13.165
Ah!

29:13.377 --> 29:14.492
Get her!

29:20.968 --> 29:22.583
Whoa.

29:22.803 --> 29:26.045
I did not see that coming.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.380
Hmm.

29:29.727 --> 29:30.091
Ahhh!

29:30.311 --> 29:31.426
(schwoo p)

29:33.314 --> 29:34.269
(schwoo p)

29:34.482 --> 29:36.268
Ah.

29:39.904 --> 29:40.734
Argh!

29:40.947 --> 29:41.732
(grunts)

29:41.948 --> 29:43.904
(schwoo p)

29:44.283 --> 29:46.365
Oh. That was a bit
bad luck, wasn't it?

29:46.577 --> 29:48.613
Well, what do you
know? Three for a girl.

29:48.829 --> 29:48.988
Yeah.

29:49.205 --> 29:52.322
Three for a girl
who is, um, sadly--

29:52.541 --> 29:54.406
Outnumbered once again.

29:54.627 --> 29:55.082
(growl)

29:55.294 --> 29:56.875
I wouldn't be so sure.

29:57.922 --> 30:00.504
Run!

30:00.716 --> 30:01.751
Watch your step!

30:01.968 --> 30:04.129
(schwoo p)

30:05.304 --> 30:09.638
Oh... well, I've seen
marriages end in worse ways.

30:09.850 --> 30:10.714
How did you, uh--

30:10.935 --> 30:12.050
The stench of crow.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.134
Easy enough to track.

30:14.939 --> 30:17.726
Well, uh-- see, I didn't
see that coming, I swear.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.478
Oh, shut up, Munin!

30:23.614 --> 30:24.945
Here goes nothing.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.954
(blood cu rdling scream)

30:42.341 --> 30:43.751
Okay.

30:49.932 --> 30:53.720
(creepy laugh)

30:53.936 --> 30:56.097
Trick is really weird.

31:04.113 --> 31:06.229
(gaSPS)

31:07.199 --> 31:09.064
Oh.

31:10.244 --> 31:12.280
Do you want to
do the next one?

31:15.166 --> 31:16.997
Alright, alright. There's
no need to get violent.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.995
Shut it or I'll
tear your throat out.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.497
And I'll pump you
both so full of Fae STD's

31:21.714 --> 31:24.296
your little egg fertilizers
will just drop right off.

31:24.508 --> 31:25.884
Wow, that's intense.

31:26.093 --> 31:26.422
Too much?

31:26.635 --> 31:28.341
No, it's good.

31:30.306 --> 31:31.341
You have to admit brother.

31:31.557 --> 31:32.922
They do have
a certain panache.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.757
I should have let
mother kill you.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.842
Okay Heckle. Jeckle.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.473
I need to get back
on that train. Now.

31:38.689 --> 31:39.519
Yeah well, the thing
about betrayal is

31:39.732 --> 31:41.347
once you betrayed someone
they hardly welcome you

31:41.567 --> 31:43.523
back into their
lives with open arms.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.192
Y'know, unless there's
a sword in each one.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.860
Yes, very good
point. If we get back

31:47.073 --> 31:48.813
on that train-- we're dead.

31:49.033 --> 31:52.446
So you just might as
well just do your worst.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.788
Oh, our worst, huh?

31:54.997 --> 31:56.658
Dyson what would
your worst be?

31:56.874 --> 31:59.160
I could disembowel them--
let them swim around in

31:59.376 --> 32:01.583
their own entrails for a
little while. That's painful.

32:01.796 --> 32:03.127
Ouf. Excruciating.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.454
Lauren?

32:04.673 --> 32:06.504
Well I could inject them with
the larvae of a Fae Bot Fly.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.753
Little bugger would take over
their central nervous system--

32:08.969 --> 32:11.381
make them do all sorts of
horrible things to themselves.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.553
You know, self-mutilation...
internal bleeding...

32:13.766 --> 32:14.881
Mmm, I like that one.

32:15.101 --> 32:18.264
Oh... alright, alright,
alright. We get the picture.

32:18.479 --> 32:19.468
A proposition.

32:19.688 --> 32:20.723
We're all ears.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.272
My brother and I will
get you on that train--

32:23.484 --> 32:26.066
If you promise to let
us leave as soon as your--

32:26.278 --> 32:28.610
Feet touch the rotting floor.

32:28.823 --> 32:30.404
Deal. Lets go.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.234
Bo, no.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.035
You can't just leave us here.

32:37.248 --> 32:38.738
Guys, I told you.

32:38.958 --> 32:42.291
I need to do this on my own.

32:42.503 --> 32:44.039
We're your family.

32:44.255 --> 32:46.792
You're weird...

32:47.007 --> 32:47.757
complicated--

32:47.967 --> 32:49.423
Completely
dysfunctional family.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.751
But we are your
family nonetheless.

32:51.971 --> 32:53.757
You are my family.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.964
And I'm the luckiest
girl in the whole world.

32:56.183 --> 32:59.300
Which is why I can not let
you risk your lives for me.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.760
Bo...

33:02.189 --> 33:04.521
Catch, lover.

33:04.733 --> 33:05.984
Fly.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.402
You know that kiss
was for me, right?

33:14.618 --> 33:16.574
Yeah, you just keep
telling yourself that.

33:20.958 --> 33:22.994
What is the worst
thing you've ever done?

33:23.210 --> 33:25.166
I don't... I don't remember...

33:25.379 --> 33:25.743
(click)

33:27.256 --> 33:29.167
Tell me! (click)

33:35.347 --> 33:40.717
(evil laugh)

33:40.936 --> 33:45.350
You ridiculous,
cheap, low-born Fae.

33:45.566 --> 33:48.399
Do you have any idea
how powerful I am?

33:48.611 --> 33:50.272
I could open
my veins right now

33:50.487 --> 33:52.864
and write you out
of history for good...

33:53.073 --> 33:53.482
(click)

33:53.699 --> 33:55.030
Like I did Rainer!

33:55.242 --> 34:00.908
(wind blows)

34:03.667 --> 34:04.827
Agh.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.500
That's it.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.453
I remember.

34:09.673 --> 34:11.459
I remember who
the Wanderer is.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.927
How he came to be,
what he is now.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.632
I know why I haven't
been trying to...

34:17.848 --> 34:20.931
It's because I...

34:21.143 --> 34:23.225
Did I do this?

34:23.437 --> 34:26.725
Did I do this to...

34:26.941 --> 34:30.729
I created all
of this didn't I?

34:30.945 --> 34:34.028
So sad, Fitzy.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.152
You've tried so hard to
walk away from your power.

34:37.368 --> 34:38.608
To make things right.

34:38.827 --> 34:43.070
But in the end, the
past will always find a way.

34:43.290 --> 34:44.245
Even you.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.574
Even the all-powerful
Blood King,

34:46.794 --> 34:49.877
even your power is a curse.

34:50.089 --> 34:53.627
Even you cannot escape fate.

34:53.842 --> 34:56.219
(chuckles)

34:56.428 --> 34:59.215
What in the world could be
funny at a moment like this?

34:59.431 --> 35:02.047
With all of your ability
to change the future,

35:02.268 --> 35:04.930
no matter what you do,
you are still powerless

35:05.145 --> 35:07.887
to change your nature.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.440
I have to find Bo.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.359
l have to warn her.

35:17.950 --> 35:20.737
I will tell my sister
you come by, Fitzy.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.415
Shit just got real.

35:35.175 --> 35:36.210
What do we do?

35:36.427 --> 35:37.132
Finger paint.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.424
Kenz!

35:38.637 --> 35:40.252
I'm only half kidding.
Do you have a better idea?

35:40.472 --> 35:41.461
No.

35:53.402 --> 35:55.108
Ah! Fire in the hole!

35:59.616 --> 36:01.072
Okay.

36:08.459 --> 36:10.370
Uh...

36:10.586 --> 36:12.076
Eugh.

36:21.138 --> 36:22.253
It's not working!

36:22.473 --> 36:23.462
Okay.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.889
Maybe Trick needs to
write in it. Or, uh...

36:26.101 --> 36:27.932
Someone Trick
has written about.

36:28.145 --> 36:30.101
I'm sorry Kenz.

36:36.779 --> 36:38.565
Ah, Kenzi!

36:42.409 --> 36:42.864
What's happening?

36:43.077 --> 36:44.066
I don't know.

36:56.799 --> 36:57.879
Tamsin let go!

36:58.092 --> 36:58.626
Agh!

36:58.842 --> 37:00.423
I can't!

37:05.933 --> 37:07.889
I must take his soul.

37:08.102 --> 37:09.967
It belongs to me.

37:10.938 --> 37:12.053
Oh boy.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.564
No.

37:20.781 --> 37:23.022
But this is a warriors soul.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.152
I must take it.

37:24.368 --> 37:25.824
It is my purpose.

37:26.036 --> 37:26.991
No.

37:27.204 --> 37:29.536
You know this, Blood King.

37:29.748 --> 37:30.908
He has fallen in battle

37:31.125 --> 37:33.457
and I must take him to
the Einherjar in Valhalla.

37:33.669 --> 37:34.579
It is written.

37:34.795 --> 37:36.001
Written?

37:36.588 --> 37:37.919
Written?

37:38.132 --> 37:40.874
If it wasn't written by me then
what importance could it have?

37:41.093 --> 37:42.674
But you know what will happen.

37:42.886 --> 37:45.923
You overstate your
importance, Vulture.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.175
That's right.

37:47.391 --> 37:49.427
You are nothing
more than carrion.

37:49.643 --> 37:53.602
A greedy bird pecking
at the helpless dead.

37:53.814 --> 37:55.224
My helpless dead.

37:55.441 --> 37:59.935
I am a Valkyrie
and we are a proud race.

38:00.154 --> 38:05.319
Then how can you let
yourself become so... ugly?

38:05.534 --> 38:07.820
So disheveled?

38:08.036 --> 38:10.413
So disgusting?

38:10.622 --> 38:13.580
You're a shadow of
your former self, Tamsin.

38:13.792 --> 38:17.580
My lives are ending.

38:17.796 --> 38:21.414
For good this time.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.545
And I have made
so many mistakes...

38:24.761 --> 38:26.137
That I fear my soul is--

38:26.346 --> 38:27.506
Damned?

38:27.723 --> 38:28.473
Yes.

38:28.682 --> 38:31.594
To hell?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.311
Yes.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.897
Don't you want to
be beautiful again?

38:39.109 --> 38:40.770
To re-write your path?

38:40.986 --> 38:44.820
To have new life?

38:45.032 --> 38:47.569
More than anything.

38:47.784 --> 38:53.825
If only I had more time, I
would do things so differently.

38:54.041 --> 38:56.032
I would cleanse my soul.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.037
And wipe my sins away.

38:58.253 --> 39:01.120
I will give you
what you desire.

39:01.340 --> 39:05.629
But, for payment,
I must have his soul.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.708
Why?

39:08.096 --> 39:11.554
So that I may curse him
with the words of my blood.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.382
For his defiance.

39:13.602 --> 39:15.433
For his arrogance.

39:15.646 --> 39:18.228
For thinking he could
change the laws of the King.

39:18.440 --> 39:25.528
So that he will never rise and
take arms against my will again.

39:25.739 --> 39:29.823
So that his soul
will wander in eternity.

39:30.035 --> 39:34.369
For no one will
remember his name.

39:34.581 --> 39:39.541
No one will remember
Rainer the defiant.

40:02.109 --> 40:03.565
Uh...

40:10.659 --> 40:11.648
Tammy!

40:11.868 --> 40:13.244
Tammy wake up!

40:13.453 --> 40:14.203
Oh wake up.

40:14.413 --> 40:15.573
Wake up, I'm so sorry.

40:15.789 --> 40:16.778
I'm so sorry.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.864
I was just worried about
Bo, Tammy, wake up!

40:19.084 --> 40:20.665
Wake up, come on!

40:29.261 --> 40:30.501
Are you him?

40:32.347 --> 40:33.678
Are you Rainer?

40:39.646 --> 40:41.182
I asked you a question.

40:42.274 --> 40:43.855
Are you the Wanderer?

40:51.116 --> 40:53.072
Oh...

40:53.285 --> 40:55.241
Not really
what I was expecting.

40:55.454 --> 40:56.864
I knew you'd come for me.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.457
Yeah, that makes two of us.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.681
Tammy wake up,
wake up, I'm sorry.

41:26.902 --> 41:27.561
Wake up!

41:27.778 --> 41:30.235
Please, please, please...

41:31.531 --> 41:35.399
Whatever you do...
don't trust Trick.

41:38.622 --> 41:39.828
We have to find Bo.

41:40.040 --> 41:40.529
Now.

41:40.749 --> 41:41.704
Yeah, well, we lost her.

41:41.917 --> 41:42.406
What?

41:42.626 --> 41:43.832
She's back on the train.

41:44.044 --> 41:45.375
You two have to arm up.

41:45.587 --> 41:49.626
Call Hale, call Kenzi,
call Tamsin, hell, call Vex.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.797
Trick, what is going on?

41:52.010 --> 41:53.420
I know who took Bo.

41:53.637 --> 41:55.548
I know who the Wanderer is.

41:55.764 --> 41:57.550
His name is Rainer.

41:57.766 --> 41:59.381
He's my mortal enemy.

42:01.520 --> 42:02.885
Hey, guys.

42:03.105 --> 42:05.221
Bo, thank the gods!

42:05.899 --> 42:07.400
Hey, you okay?

42:07.609 --> 42:10.567
Yeah, yeah I'm great.

42:10.779 --> 42:12.235
Never better actually.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.063
I, um...

42:16.868 --> 42:17.323
Whoa.

42:17.536 --> 42:21.700
I found out why
I agreed to be dark.

42:21.915 --> 42:24.873
I found out it
was my idea, actually.

42:25.085 --> 42:26.165
What are you talking about?

42:28.922 --> 42:30.503
to get back to the train.

42:30.716 --> 42:31.705
To Rainer.

42:31.925 --> 42:33.631
Willingly.

42:33.844 --> 42:35.175
Willingly?

42:35.387 --> 42:38.971
So that I could break his curse
and free him from the train.

42:39.182 --> 42:40.763
And with the whole
memory gone thing,

42:40.976 --> 42:43.763
well it became
quite a dilemma.

42:43.979 --> 42:46.561
God, I'm sorry that I put
all of you through that.

42:46.773 --> 42:50.561
Bo, I don't understand.
What's happening?

42:50.777 --> 42:51.892
That's him!

42:52.112 --> 42:53.318
That's Rainer!

42:57.159 --> 42:57.568
(g rowls)

42:57.784 --> 42:59.570
Dyson, don't!

43:01.413 --> 43:06.032
Just listen. All of you.

43:06.251 --> 43:11.086
I did all of this...
because he is not my enemy,

43:11.298 --> 43:13.289
and he is definitely
not my father.

43:18.555 --> 43:19.635
He's my destiny.
