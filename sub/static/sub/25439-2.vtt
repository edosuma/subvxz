00:13.708 --> 00:15.008

00:15.041 --> 00:16.808
KATY: Who, Jarret?
DAN: No, Garrets.

00:16.841 --> 00:17.875
He's a good guy.

00:17.908 --> 00:19.441
He took me to the movies
in grade six,

00:19.475 --> 00:20.608
and he wouldn't
hold my hand.

00:20.641 --> 00:21.808
A young man's hands
can get sweaty

00:21.841 --> 00:23.441
in that sort of situation.

00:23.475 --> 00:25.441
Then put your arm around me,
what's the problem?

00:25.475 --> 00:28.008
Anywho, Garrett's movings down
to Los Angeles

00:28.041 --> 00:29.541
to try to be an actors.

00:29.575 --> 00:30.941
He's winning for
the weather alone.

00:30.975 --> 00:32.975
Negative. It shouldn't
be warm all the time.

00:33.008 --> 00:34.875
Four seasons helps
keep a man regular.

00:34.908 --> 00:36.441

00:37.408 --> 00:38.875
Huh.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.641
Garrett's moving down to LA

00:40.675 --> 00:42.975
to be an actor.

00:43.008 --> 00:44.775
Isn't that something
you just kind of are?

00:44.808 --> 00:46.108
It's not as if a librarian

00:46.141 --> 00:49.008
can just call themselves
a librarian without
collecting a paycheck.

00:49.041 --> 00:50.408
They got to work.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.008
That's correct, Ms. Katys.

00:52.041 --> 00:53.808
So Garrett is moving down
to Los Angeles

00:53.841 --> 00:56.075

as an actor.

00:56.108 --> 00:57.708
Can you do that?
Do whats?

00:58.675 --> 01:00.408
Well, earn a living
as an actor.

01:00.441 --> 01:02.808
That's a thing?
Sure it is.

01:02.841 --> 01:05.575
So, you can earn a living
as an actor, you say?

01:05.608 --> 01:07.808
Yeah. How do you think Brad Pitt
bought all those paintings

01:07.841 --> 01:09.808
and became so passionates
about architecture?

01:09.841 --> 01:13.441
I would smash that dude
with a category five hurricane

The drugs are
all over there.

08:15.541 --> 08:17.941
Just bring me that computer
and get us to the Dark Web.

08:17.975 --> 08:20.908
First the meth,
then the Dark Web.

08:20.941 --> 08:23.041
Roald.
You want some, too?

08:23.075 --> 08:24.308
I'm good.

08:25.975 --> 08:28.575
Bring me the Dark Web
over to my stand‐up desk.

08:30.908 --> 08:32.475
Why do you have
a stand‐up desk?

08:32.508 --> 08:34.641
Because sitting is
quietly murdering you.

08:37.575 --> 08:39.575
Actually, yes, Roald, I...
I will have some meth.

08:44.341 --> 08:45.475
And here we are.

08:45.841 --> 08:47.575
The Dark Web.

08:47.608 --> 08:49.408
Why do you guys crave
the Dark Web so much?

08:49.441 --> 08:50.708
Because the Dark Web
is exclusive.

08:50.741 --> 08:52.541
The Dark Web
is only accessible

08:52.575 --> 08:53.908
using special software,

08:53.941 --> 08:56.475
users remain untraceable

08:56.508 --> 08:58.041
and anonymous
on the Dark Web.

08:58.075 --> 08:59.808
You can hire a hitman
on the Dark Web.

08:59.841 --> 09:01.675
Purchase illegal contraband
on the Dark Web.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.641
Sell illegal contraband
on the Dark Web.

09:03.675 --> 09:05.075
Or you could join
a rebel army.

09:05.108 --> 09:07.575
Or you could build a bomb
for your own rebel army
on the Dark Web.

09:07.608 --> 09:11.775
The thrill of having
all of that at your fingertips
is so...metal!

09:12.908 --> 09:14.375
What's on the menu today, chef?

09:14.408 --> 09:16.375
I left a tab open
for you guys.

09:16.408 --> 09:17.541
Something I thought
you'd dig.

09:17.575 --> 09:19.008
(MOANS)

09:19.041 --> 09:21.341
It's funny, the way
you last liked that, like
the Dark Web site was food.

09:21.375 --> 09:22.475
'Cause...

09:23.441 --> 09:25.308
BOTH: "How to cook human meat!"

09:26.041 --> 09:27.308
(CHIMING)

09:27.341 --> 09:28.475
STEWART: Oh, fuck!

09:28.508 --> 09:29.641
These Hard Right mutts again.

09:29.675 --> 09:30.908
I don't like these mutts.

09:30.941 --> 09:32.608
We could ignore
the call.
Oh, Stewart!

09:32.641 --> 09:33.975
Let's ignore the call.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.941
But how are we gonna
find cool new things
to do on the Dark Web,

09:35.975 --> 09:38.075
unless we make
cool new pals
on the Dark Web.

09:38.108 --> 09:39.041
Fine,

09:39.075 --> 09:40.975
anything to keep
the Dark Web sustainable.

09:42.375 --> 09:43.541
But we should sit for this.

09:43.575 --> 09:44.775
(CHIMING CONTINUES)

09:49.575 --> 09:50.808
(SONG PLAYING SOFTLY
OVER STEREO)

09:58.808 --> 09:59.808
What are you doing?

10:01.841 --> 10:03.641
What?

10:03.675 --> 10:05.608
Well, you're sitting, breathing,
and taking your boots off,

10:05.641 --> 10:06.975
so, the other thing.

10:07.008 --> 10:09.708
To borrow a phrase from
my stance on social media,

10:10.375 --> 10:11.441
I don't follow.

10:11.475 --> 10:12.408
Crossing your legs.

10:12.441 --> 10:14.808
Yeah, for a hot second,
to take my boots off.

10:14.841 --> 10:16.808
Boots or no boots,
don't you think it's
a little fruity loops

10:16.841 --> 10:17.908
for a man to be
sitting like that?

10:17.941 --> 10:19.508
On the contrary,

10:19.541 --> 10:23.075
I'm sitting like this because
the less bending over
a man does, the better.

10:23.108 --> 10:24.341
Hmm.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.808
Sounds homophobic to me.

10:25.841 --> 10:27.708
Sounds chiropractic to me.

10:27.741 --> 10:29.908
Hmm. Just checking.

10:29.941 --> 10:30.875
I swing both ways, you know?

10:30.908 --> 10:32.641
So, if you ever wanted
to invite a girl over...

10:33.741 --> 10:34.775
or a guy...

10:36.541 --> 10:38.875
Are we gonna have
a problem here, Tanis?

10:38.908 --> 10:40.475
(CHUCKLES)

10:40.508 --> 10:43.575
Let's just stop talking,
food's ready. Come, eat.

10:55.941 --> 10:57.675
(TRANCE MUSIC PLAYING
OVER STEREO)

10:57.708 --> 11:00.841
What's on the Dark Web menu
today, gentlemen?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.741
(SCOFFS) Funny you
put it like that 'cause...

11:02.775 --> 11:05.575
We were about to enjoy
some Dark Web literature

11:05.608 --> 11:07.541
about how to cook
human meat until...

11:08.508 --> 11:10.308
our friend called.

11:10.341 --> 11:13.741
Hmm. 13% of human beings
are cannibals, huh?

11:14.608 --> 11:16.041
13% sounds right.

11:16.075 --> 11:18.308
Wrong! That's what
they want you to think.

11:18.341 --> 11:22.408
The truth, 100%
of human beings are cannibals.

11:22.441 --> 11:23.708
The... The ones
on Earth, anyway.

11:25.375 --> 11:26.775
How do you
know that?

11:26.808 --> 11:27.908
How do I know that?

11:27.941 --> 11:30.041
Ha! Well,
let's rewind the clock.

11:30.075 --> 11:31.941
1840, Ireland,

11:31.975 --> 11:33.508
the potato famine forces

11:33.541 --> 11:36.575
thousands of those godless,
heathen bogtrotters

11:36.608 --> 11:38.475
to migrate to North America.

11:38.508 --> 11:41.608
(IN IRISH ACCENT)
No potatoes, you say!

11:41.641 --> 11:44.975
Well, then what did
those paddy‐mick prods eat
on the fuckin' boat over here?

11:46.441 --> 11:48.975
Fast‐forward, 1955,
Des Plaines, Illinois,

11:49.008 --> 11:51.775
McDonald's restaurants
opened their first location.

11:51.808 --> 11:54.575
Not a single cow was
photographed that day,

11:54.608 --> 11:57.308
and yet they're
serving burgers? Gotcha.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.008
Now McDonald's openly...

11:59.041 --> 12:00.441
(BREATHING RAPIDLY)

12:00.475 --> 12:04.641
Openly boasts
over 999 billion served.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.608
Fast‐forward, 2016, Donald Trump
is elected to office,

12:09.641 --> 12:13.541
inherits the highest percentage
per capita of cannibals

12:13.575 --> 12:15.708
in the world.

12:15.741 --> 12:18.608
The left‐wing, fake news,
pinko media

12:18.641 --> 12:19.875
wants you to think that he spent

12:19.908 --> 12:22.641
16 of his first 100 days
in office golfing.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.708
Wrong. Wrong!

12:24.741 --> 12:27.808
Donald J. Trump spent 16
of his first 100 days,

12:27.841 --> 12:29.741
as President of
the United States,

12:29.775 --> 12:30.941
Commander‐in‐Chief,

12:30.975 --> 12:33.508
leader of the goddamned
free world,

12:33.541 --> 12:36.375
getting that per capita
percentage of cannibals

12:36.408 --> 12:39.308
down from 100 to... Everett?

12:39.708 --> 12:41.508
Uh... 13%?

12:41.541 --> 12:42.875
That's right. Do the math.

12:44.908 --> 12:47.041
No, no, actually do...
Actually do the math.

12:47.075 --> 12:48.575
Do the meth?

12:48.608 --> 12:49.775
We did the meth.

12:49.808 --> 12:51.341
(EXHALES SHAKILY)

12:51.375 --> 12:55.475
Listen, uh, friend.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.941
We've been listening to you
ramble for an hour.

12:57.975 --> 13:01.041
We only joined the Dark Web
to see cool new things,

13:01.075 --> 13:02.875
and join cool
new movements.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.275
And make
cool new pals.

13:07.608 --> 13:09.375
Cool new pals, you say?

13:09.408 --> 13:10.441
Yes.
No.

13:10.475 --> 13:11.608
Stewart.

13:11.641 --> 13:14.375
<i>I know how you can make</i>
<i>all the coolest new pals ever.</i>

13:14.408 --> 13:15.975
Spare us the hyperbole.

13:16.008 --> 13:17.375
How?

13:17.408 --> 13:18.841
Join the Hard Right!

13:21.075 --> 13:23.708
I said that like that was
leading into another monologue,

13:23.741 --> 13:26.408
but it's really just...
Just joi... Join the Hard Right.

13:26.441 --> 13:27.375

<i>Oh, you probably...</i>

13:30.975 --> 13:32.908
couldn't... Do you like it?

13:34.441 --> 13:35.575
I... I designed it.

13:42.275 --> 13:43.941
Mmm.

13:43.975 --> 13:47.208
Eat up. You're gonna need
fuel for later. (CHUCKLES)

13:52.041 --> 13:53.275
What...
What?

13:53.308 --> 13:56.008
...the actual fuck
was that now?

13:56.041 --> 13:56.941
What now?

13:56.975 --> 13:59.241
Well, you're sitting, eating,
and breathing,

13:59.275 --> 14:00.308
so, the other thing.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.875
Burping?
Yes.

14:02.908 --> 14:05.175
Some primitive,
distressing version of it

14:05.208 --> 14:06.875
That was nothing.
Terrific.

14:06.908 --> 14:08.941
You can burp, too.
Outstanding.

14:08.975 --> 14:10.841
You can fucking fart,
if you want.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.275
You know why?
Because it's normal.

14:12.308 --> 14:13.575
But is it fashionable?

14:13.608 --> 14:14.841
It's becoming...

14:14.875 --> 14:16.241
It's unbecoming.

14:16.275 --> 14:18.275
Well, your boyfriend Daryl

14:18.308 --> 14:19.908
burps and spits.

14:19.941 --> 14:21.908
Dary also chases ducks,

14:21.941 --> 14:23.075
draws on the walls,

14:23.108 --> 14:25.108
and must be told
not to taste or touch

14:25.141 --> 14:26.208
everything he sees.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.475
That's true.

14:27.508 --> 14:28.541
So, is it because I'm a lady?

14:28.575 --> 14:29.775
Who's a lady?

14:31.241 --> 14:33.175
So, what, you're saying that
girls shouldn't burp, too?

14:33.208 --> 14:35.275
I don't say
what girls should do.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.008
Well, men shouldn't
shackle women.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.108
We made Prohibition happen,
watch your step.

14:39.141 --> 14:40.541
Already walkin' on eggshells.

14:40.575 --> 14:41.808
Done your food?

14:41.841 --> 14:43.575
That ship's clear
across the pond.

14:43.608 --> 14:44.908
Same. Let's go make a fire

14:44.941 --> 14:46.241
'cause it's a beautiful
fucking day.

14:46.275 --> 14:47.908
Is that what it is?
What?

14:48.541 --> 14:49.541
Hmm?

14:51.441 --> 14:52.541

at our fingertips.

14:56.908 --> 14:58.008
But full disclosure,

14:58.041 --> 15:00.241
this team's got a bit of
an attitude problem, all right?

15:00.275 --> 15:02.808
Little battle of leadership
going on in here.

15:02.841 --> 15:05.275
All right? Sure, they got their
center console skiffs,

15:05.308 --> 15:08.041
but they went through a lot
of coaches in the process.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.141
(SCOFFS)
Mundane details, boys.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.275
We want
a twin engine jet boat.

15:10.308 --> 15:11.575
We want that cruise ship.

15:11.608 --> 15:14.375
That's the attitude, pylons.
Now get in there.

15:14.408 --> 15:15.408
All right.

Sorry, boys... Ladies.

15:24.975 --> 15:26.341
We didn't know
you were ladies, boys.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.275
Um... Not ladyboys. We didn't
know you were ladies.

15:28.308 --> 15:30.508
Do you think the door is open
to everyone here?

15:30.541 --> 15:32.308
Just because Mary‐Anne
looks like she's homeless,

15:32.341 --> 15:34.141
doesn't mean you can
treat it like a shelter.

15:34.175 --> 15:35.508
Fuck you, Betty‐Anne.

15:35.541 --> 15:36.575
But she's right.

15:36.608 --> 15:38.341
Door isn't open
to everybody here.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.375
Just because our mitt looks
like the back of Christ's head,

15:40.408 --> 15:42.108
doesn't mean you can treat
it like a church.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.341
Fuck you, Mary‐Anne.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.308
Your mitt looks like Babe Ruth's
ball glove from the dirty '30s

15:46.341 --> 15:49.141
if 20 more dudes spat
chewing tobacco in it.

15:49.175 --> 15:51.508
Your mitt's actually
a work of art, Betty‐Anne.

15:51.541 --> 15:54.208
Like Salvador Dali's
melting clocks,

15:54.241 --> 15:57.108
but instead of melting clocks,
it's melting salad bowls

15:57.141 --> 15:58.375
of off‐pink ice‐cream.

15:58.408 --> 16:01.141
Hmm. I love ice‐cream,
Mary‐Anne.

16:01.175 --> 16:02.841
I love all frozen treats.

16:02.875 --> 16:07.308

a cherry‐red popsicle with
a handful of dryer lint.

Meet your new team, pheasants.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.908

that turtleneck?

16:15.941 --> 16:17.275

a lot of heat in the neck,

as I like to say.

16:18.375 --> 16:19.408
You mean, cold?

16:19.441 --> 16:21.241
I wouldn't say
I'm hot, but...

16:21.275 --> 16:23.408
Ugh. Most men I know
wouldn't complain about
something like that.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.308
You see the elephant?

16:29.341 --> 16:30.541
You mean next to
the bus crash?

16:30.575 --> 16:32.041
That's the one.
Yeah, I see it.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.108
You wanna talk about it?

16:33.141 --> 16:34.141
Let's talk about it.

16:35.008 --> 16:36.841
A woman can be what she wants.

16:36.875 --> 16:38.375
That is so nice of you
to allow that.

16:38.408 --> 16:39.508
Not what I meant.
I'm kidding.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.908
A woman should be
what she wants.

16:42.441 --> 16:43.475
Better.

16:43.508 --> 16:46.175
There's no definition
of a woman.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.808
It's the same as a man,
there's no definition...

16:47.841 --> 16:50.275
No need to womansplain,
I'm aware.

16:50.308 --> 16:53.575
But a woman should be with
a man she finds...desirable.

16:53.608 --> 16:55.575
And vice versa.

16:55.608 --> 16:57.341
Like, long‐term,
like in a relationship.

16:57.375 --> 16:58.375
Can't confirm.

16:59.941 --> 17:01.108

you're it, cowboy.

Good stuff.

17:09.308 --> 17:10.408
How short?

17:10.441 --> 17:11.975
A night.
A night?

17:12.475 --> 17:13.541
An hour?

17:14.308 --> 17:15.875
Maybe more than an hour.

17:15.908 --> 17:17.241
A night.
A night.

17:17.275 --> 17:18.341
Maybe even a morning.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.441
Maybe even a morning.

17:19.475 --> 17:20.441
'Cause we didn't do
all the things I wanted to do.

17:20.475 --> 17:22.508
Well, we talked,
we ate...
It was good, right?

17:22.541 --> 17:24.008
Thank you for supper.
My pleasure.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.208
We talked, we ate,

17:25.241 --> 17:26.408
we sat by the fire.

17:26.441 --> 17:27.575
So, then the other thing.

17:27.608 --> 17:29.141
Good enough.
Good stuff.

17:29.175 --> 17:30.175
(SNIFFLES)

17:42.108 --> 17:43.941
Just kiddin'! (CHUCKLES)

17:52.575 --> 17:54.175
DARYL: Fifteen‐two,

17:54.208 --> 17:55.775
Fifteen‐four,

17:55.808 --> 17:57.775
Runs of threes,

18:00.741 --> 18:02.175
Youse been playin'

18:02.208 --> 18:03.275
How'd it go, big brother?

18:03.308 --> 18:04.341
Do you all know what,

18:04.375 --> 18:05.608

18:05.641 --> 18:06.875

18:06.908 --> 18:08.475
Called it.
How poorly?

18:08.508 --> 18:09.541
So poor.

18:09.575 --> 18:10.808
He said, so fuckin' poor.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.375
Talkin' about ultra poor.

18:12.408 --> 18:13.808
Called it.
What did I miss?

18:13.841 --> 18:15.275
BOTH: Taco night.

18:15.308 --> 18:17.175
KATY: But not just
any taco night.

18:17.208 --> 18:18.541
(IN LA ACCENT) LA taco night.

18:18.575 --> 18:21.308
(MOCKINGLY)
Oh, there's no taco night
like an "LA" taco night.

18:21.341 --> 18:23.308
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.
You've never had taco night

18:23.341 --> 18:25.308
unless you've had
an "LA" taco night.

18:25.341 --> 18:27.508
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah. Well,
if it's taco night in "LA",

18:27.541 --> 18:29.208
then you must have had a hike.
Did youse have a hike?

18:29.241 --> 18:30.408
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.

18:30.441 --> 18:32.708
You can't have taco night
in "LA" without havin' a hike.

18:32.741 --> 18:34.441
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
We had an LA hike,

18:34.475 --> 18:36.808
but it was so cold,
it gets so cold in LA.

18:36.841 --> 18:39.141
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.
It's a deserts, don't you know?

18:39.175 --> 18:41.508
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.
It gets just as cold in "LA".

18:41.541 --> 18:43.408
It's just a different kind
of cold in "LA".

18:43.441 --> 18:44.908
(MOCKINGLY) Pull your finger
out of your ass.

18:44.941 --> 18:46.441
(MOCKINGLY) That's what I say,
I said pull your finger
out of your ass,

18:46.475 --> 18:47.775
you're from "LA".

18:47.808 --> 18:51.141
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
You've got to take La Cienega
to La Tijera

18:51.175 --> 18:53.375
if you're going to LAX in "LA".

18:53.408 --> 18:55.808
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
I will have another
cold‐pressed juice

18:55.841 --> 18:57.141
'cause we're in LA.

18:57.175 --> 18:59.441
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.
I'm just poppin' down
to Trader Joe's

18:59.475 --> 19:01.575
to load up on kombuchas in "LA".

19:01.608 --> 19:04.441
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah. You can
stick your Hybrid Toyotas
straight up your ass,

19:04.475 --> 19:06.541
it's all about Teslas
now in "LA".

19:06.575 --> 19:09.141
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
It's like you could never
usually get a pizza

19:09.175 --> 19:11.175
that was that good
in "LA" until now.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.341
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
We're gonna have a winter brunch

19:13.375 --> 19:15.241
outside on Melrose. (CHUCKLES)

19:15.275 --> 19:16.441
'Cause you can do that in LA.

19:16.475 --> 19:19.475
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah. I'm taking
improv classes at the UCBs,

19:19.508 --> 19:22.308
but only until the groundlings
figure it out in "LA".

19:22.341 --> 19:25.575
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah. You better
get joined in a burlesque troupe
if you're going to "LA."

19:25.608 --> 19:26.641
"LA".

19:26.675 --> 19:28.208
"LA".
"LA".

19:28.241 --> 19:29.475
"LA"?
"LA".

19:29.508 --> 19:30.775
"LA".
DAN: "LA".

19:30.808 --> 19:32.275
"LA".
"LA".

19:32.308 --> 19:34.675
"LA"...

19:34.708 --> 19:35.975
Pull your finger
out of your ass.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.808
That's what I say,
I said pull your finger
out of your ass.

19:37.841 --> 19:39.608
