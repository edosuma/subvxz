whole vampire thing right now.

19:46.733 --> 19:48.651
Me too.

19:48.735 --> 19:51.696
I just met the sweetest guy
named Cameron.

19:51.780 --> 19:54.157
I think he might be the one.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.701
<i>[ Mitchell]
Can people change? I don't know.</i>

19:56.785 --> 20:01.831
People are who they are—
Give or take, yeah, 15%.

20:01.915 --> 20:05.210
That's how much people can
change if they really want to.

20:05.335 --> 20:08.088
Well, I'll see you when I
see you. Yeah, thanks for...

20:16.554 --> 20:18.765
[Whispering ]
Haley, sweetie, wake up.

20:18.890 --> 20:22.936
What? I need you to
teach me to use the TV.

20:23.019 --> 20:26.272
Now? Why can't
Dad teach you?

20:26.356 --> 20:28.525
Because we're married.

20:29.984 --> 20:33.738
Whether it's for themselves
or for the people they love...

20:33.822 --> 20:35.490
That way. Yeah.

20:35.615 --> 20:37.534
And then press—
Mmm! I got it.

20:37.659 --> 20:41.121
<i>Yeah. Yeah,</i> 75 %.

[ Both Cheering ]

20:43.164 --> 20:44.624
<i>But you know What?</i>
I <i>did it!</i>

20:44.749 --> 20:48.336
<i>Sometimes that's just enough-</i>
I <i>did it!</i>

20:51.506 --> 20:53.341
All right, I'll see you guys
next week, huh?

20:53.466 --> 20:55.051
[All Chattering ]
Jay.Jay.

20:57.387 --> 21:00.557
Listen, I wanna thank you for, you
know, helping me out with that jam.

21:00.682 --> 21:03.476
It was nothin'. No, no, no.
And I got you a little present.

21:03.601 --> 21:05.270
You didn't have to do that.
No, I did.

21:05.353 --> 21:08.648
Two tickets to see
the great Michael Bublé.

21:08.731 --> 21:10.984
The guy sings like an angel.

21:11.067 --> 21:13.027
He's gonna be outside
at one of the amphitheaters.

21:13.069 --> 21:14.737
Gloria's gonna love it.

21:14.863 --> 21:16.865
No. I'm talkin' about you
and me. Oh, you and me.

21:16.990 --> 21:18.616
Yeah.
Well, that's a little...

21:18.700 --> 21:21.286
I thought maybe we could have
a little picnic since it's outside.

21:21.369 --> 21:24.330
You know? I'll get some nice
bottle of wine, a little cheese.

21:24.456 --> 21:27.125
Lay on a nice blanket.
All right? Yeah, fine.

21:27.208 --> 21:30.753
Yo, hey. I like your hair.
Who does your hair? Huh?

21:30.837 --> 21:33.214
Yo, handsome.
Who does your hair?
