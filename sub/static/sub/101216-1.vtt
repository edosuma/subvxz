01:48.322 --> 01:49.991
Jesus goddamn Christ.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.894
Where'd they all come from?

01:54.996 --> 01:57.665
I didn't expect a rehash
of Lawrence, Kansas

01:57.698 --> 01:59.968
in this godforsaken hellhole.

02:00.001 --> 02:01.236
Keep your voice down.

02:14.550 --> 02:18.287
We need a plan to get
the hell out of here.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.889
Don't crowd me, I'm thinking.

02:21.723 --> 02:23.225
Yeah, well that's a comfort.

02:24.659 --> 02:27.028
Should've done more thinking
before we accepted this job.

02:29.264 --> 02:33.603
You couldn't know what
we're up against out there.

02:35.270 --> 02:37.073
Spent a lifetime
being careful.

02:39.007 --> 02:40.009
Now we're in this.

02:46.048 --> 02:47.550
Let's hope the
horses are still tied

02:47.582 --> 02:49.718
behind the express office.

02:54.590 --> 02:56.224
I do find it funny, though,

02:59.861 --> 03:02.430
that we're holed up in
the sheriff's office.

03:02.463 --> 03:04.066
Ironic.

03:04.098 --> 03:05.268
Huh?

03:06.634 --> 03:07.836
I said ironic.

03:09.403 --> 03:11.240
What's that?

03:14.209 --> 03:16.344
A state of affairs or an event

03:16.377 --> 03:18.814
that's contrary to what
one normally expects.

03:21.516 --> 03:24.219
Are you shoving your book
learning in my face again?

03:30.893 --> 03:33.729
Sure as hell never
thought I'd be this age,

03:33.762 --> 03:36.131
and caught up in a
hornet's nest like this.

05:31.879 --> 05:33.848
Playing cards
bores me, stranger.

05:35.817 --> 05:38.519
It's been three months
since I seen you,

05:38.552 --> 05:40.521
and you can't think of
anything better to do

05:40.555 --> 05:42.223
than flipping cards?

05:44.425 --> 05:45.260
Hey.

05:46.528 --> 05:49.230
- I see how you like it.
- Mm-hm.

05:49.264 --> 05:53.502
I told you that I'll make
time for anything you want.

05:53.535 --> 05:55.304
That's what you
said last night.

05:56.404 --> 05:57.639
Then you and your
buddy lit out of here

05:57.673 --> 06:00.042
like a bunch of sinners
getting out of a church.

06:00.074 --> 06:02.277
Well that was business, Belle.

06:09.718 --> 06:11.220
You two gonna get busy?

06:14.488 --> 06:16.391
Steamboat's a'coming.

06:25.434 --> 06:28.070
Don't leave me when this
long stretch is coming.

06:28.103 --> 06:32.240
Believe me, if I had my way,
I'd never leave this room.

06:34.910 --> 06:37.079
I'd just have the
house send up my meals

06:37.112 --> 06:39.481
and my whiskey
three times a day.

06:39.514 --> 06:41.317
Oh, don't hand me that, Dev.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.853
You would be restless
after two hours.

06:46.555 --> 06:50.492
Sometimes I wonder
if I'm really lonely.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.862
Like in my favorite poem.

07:01.470 --> 07:04.907
You know, I spent
a lifetime running

07:07.442 --> 07:10.713
after almost everything.

07:12.213 --> 07:14.884
You did stop for a while once.

07:16.517 --> 07:20.455
I've been trying to
live that down ever since.

07:20.488 --> 07:23.992
Your mistake was
that it wasn't with me.

07:28.963 --> 07:32.701
Probably.

07:32.733 --> 07:33.635
Probably?

07:39.875 --> 07:41.043
Undoubtedly.

07:45.613 --> 07:48.950
You know, you two fellas

07:48.983 --> 07:51.586
should buy the tack and
feed store from Mills.

07:53.321 --> 07:56.826
He's 87, he's been trying
to sell it for eight years.

07:57.959 --> 07:59.562
I know you boys
have the capital.

08:00.829 --> 08:02.497
Well that's where you
got it wrong, honey pie.

08:02.531 --> 08:05.167
We spent the last job's
take on them army rifles

08:05.199 --> 08:06.101
for them Mexicans.

08:16.978 --> 08:19.982
How in the hell do you
talk me into these things?

08:20.014 --> 08:21.449
Whiskey.

08:21.483 --> 08:23.084
No, serious, damn it.

08:23.117 --> 08:25.420
How in the hell do you
talk me into these things?

08:25.452 --> 08:29.625
Look, we got
the map, mean place to set.

08:29.658 --> 08:30.960
Come in the from the west.

08:32.092 --> 08:34.028
It's the Mexican Army,
for Christ's sake.

08:34.062 --> 08:36.097
Yeah, the officers.

08:36.130 --> 08:37.765
The idea is sound.

08:42.037 --> 08:43.772
Oh, whoa.

08:43.804 --> 08:46.340
That's a lot of rifle for
this job, don't you think?

08:46.374 --> 08:47.875
Well we might
need this Sharps.

08:54.548 --> 08:56.885
We're not hunting buffalo.

09:04.625 --> 09:07.196
How many times did you
almost get me killed?

09:08.929 --> 09:10.464
You're keeping count?

09:20.475 --> 09:22.377
How was we to know
those goddamn Mexicans

09:22.409 --> 09:23.846
weren't gonna pay us?

09:23.879 --> 09:27.850
We barely got out of
there with our lives.

09:33.288 --> 09:35.456
You should've done
what Dev suggested.

09:38.692 --> 09:40.328
Taken me and Etta
to New Orleans.

09:41.428 --> 09:43.298
You could've bought
me a new hat.

09:43.331 --> 09:45.366
Well don't worry, sugar.

09:45.399 --> 09:47.870
This new job's gonna
set us in tall cotton.

09:52.774 --> 09:54.710
Oh, that reminds me.

09:57.479 --> 09:59.815
This came for you
about an hour ago.

09:59.847 --> 10:00.682
Oh.

10:07.087 --> 10:08.557
Goddamn, it's from McDonald.

10:08.590 --> 10:09.490
I gotta tell Dev.

10:24.371 --> 10:25.774
Hey.

10:25.807 --> 10:29.043
We just got the
telegram from McDonald.

10:30.577 --> 10:33.514
Jesus, do you always barge
in on a room with a shut door?

10:33.548 --> 10:36.083
I knocked, gave you warning,

10:36.116 --> 10:37.752
so as Etta could get decent.

10:39.888 --> 10:41.223
What did the message say?

10:41.255 --> 10:42.990
He's ready for us.

10:43.024 --> 10:46.461
We're supposed to meet him at
the mining base camp tomorrow.

10:48.163 --> 10:53.134
Well, I guess this is
goodbye to you fellas again.

10:54.034 --> 10:55.904
Hell, Dev, you just got here.

10:57.371 --> 11:00.341
Look, why don't you go tell
Ethan to get the mounts ready?

11:01.275 --> 11:03.344
I'll be down in an hour or so.

11:03.378 --> 11:06.048
Sure, but we
best get a move on.

11:06.081 --> 11:10.152
I hear he's not the kind of
guy that takes to tardiness.

11:10.184 --> 11:12.286
You can go say a
proper farewell to Belle.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.456
Not like usual, okay?

11:14.489 --> 11:16.425
Sure, sure thing, Dev.

11:16.457 --> 11:19.360
Besides, that son
of a bitch can wait.

11:19.394 --> 11:21.028
Right, and then I'll go down

11:21.062 --> 11:22.496
and tell Ethan to
get the mounts.

11:22.529 --> 11:23.966
Right.

11:23.999 --> 11:26.067
Now why don't you start by
getting the hell out of here?

11:26.100 --> 11:27.302
Sure, sure.

11:28.937 --> 11:30.205
So long, Etta.

11:30.238 --> 11:32.641
Until next time, Jonas.

11:38.779 --> 11:42.817
I swear, you two could not
exist without each other.

11:43.784 --> 11:45.286
You may be right about that.

11:52.726 --> 11:55.730
Say, why don't you ever take me

11:55.764 --> 11:58.533
on one of your little outings?

12:01.068 --> 12:02.503
What the hell would you do?

12:03.471 --> 12:04.440
Oh, you're right.

12:08.043 --> 12:09.043
You're always right.

12:10.144 --> 12:10.980
Christ.

12:11.812 --> 12:13.816
Now before you leave,

12:15.115 --> 12:18.787
why don't you tell me
how wonderful I am?

12:18.820 --> 12:20.422
Oh I'll do more than that.

12:26.794 --> 12:29.930
Mr. McDonald, Mr. McDonald!

12:29.964 --> 12:31.700
Mr. McDonald!

12:31.732 --> 12:32.900
Riders coming!

12:56.256 --> 12:57.325
You sure about this?

12:58.293 --> 13:00.162
It'll be easy pickings, Dev.

13:00.195 --> 13:01.897
Just like taking
candy from a baby.

13:04.432 --> 13:05.300
So you say.

13:07.168 --> 13:09.203
Okay, let's go.

13:14.842 --> 13:16.812
Gentlemen, I've
been expecting you.

13:18.178 --> 13:20.481
We may discuss all issues
here in confidence.

13:25.419 --> 13:27.021
Let's get to it.

13:27.054 --> 13:29.457
Right down to business,
I can appreciate that.

13:30.758 --> 13:33.228
Time is a precious commodity.

13:37.131 --> 13:39.266
My name is McDonald.

13:39.299 --> 13:43.104
I operate the mining
interests in this area.

13:43.138 --> 13:45.807
Your colleague in Santa
Fe extolled the virtues

13:45.840 --> 13:49.444
of your professionalism,
and even went so far

13:49.476 --> 13:52.747
as to speak glowingly of your
discretion in such matters.

13:56.884 --> 13:59.288
Myra, say hello
to Dev and Jonas.

14:01.456 --> 14:02.925
Hello, boys.

14:04.091 --> 14:07.261
I hope you're enjoying
our salubrious climate.

14:08.263 --> 14:09.264
What's salubrious?

14:10.431 --> 14:15.070
My goodness, Mac,
they certainly are handsome gentlemen.

14:17.337 --> 14:21.209
Say adios, Myra, I'll
see you upstairs later.

14:23.344 --> 14:24.278
Au revoir, boys.

14:40.662 --> 14:44.833
I found her on a
Galveston riverboat.

14:50.837 --> 14:51.973
As I was saying.

14:55.442 --> 14:58.045
Not everyone can
appreciate the legality

14:58.078 --> 15:00.281
of my approach to this
particular problem.

15:01.749 --> 15:06.754
Well, we kinda operate on
the outside of recognized law.

15:07.654 --> 15:08.490
Easy.

15:10.024 --> 15:12.528
I cast no judgment out
here in this territory.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.363
Now if this were
Chicago or St. Louis,

15:16.397 --> 15:18.700
that might be a different
story, but out here,

15:19.933 --> 15:22.937
out here in this
godforsaken land,

15:22.971 --> 15:24.940
sometimes a man's
gotta go to extremes

15:24.972 --> 15:27.208
to protect what's his.

15:27.241 --> 15:28.943
Do you gentlemen disagree?

15:32.279 --> 15:33.214
Well I thought not.

15:34.514 --> 15:36.350
After all, a buck's
a buck, right?

15:38.318 --> 15:41.722
Well now that we've dispensed
with any moral question,

15:41.755 --> 15:46.227
either of gentlemen familiar
with the town of Guilt Ridge?

15:46.260 --> 15:47.728
Sure.

15:47.761 --> 15:49.897
Isn't that where they
had that cholera outbreak

15:50.898 --> 15:51.800
a year back?

15:51.832 --> 15:53.634
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

15:53.668 --> 15:55.870
The whole town was decimated.

16:09.216 --> 16:11.252
Those that weren't stricken
with that filth just moved out,

16:11.285 --> 16:14.622
and the place is practically
a ghost town now.

16:16.356 --> 16:17.959
So why send us to a graveyard?

16:19.726 --> 16:22.630
There's only one business
that's maintained a presence

16:22.663 --> 16:23.532
in that hellhole.

16:25.399 --> 16:26.600
Either of you boys familiar

16:26.634 --> 16:29.137
with the express and
payroll office there?

16:32.105 --> 16:35.110
Well, it's run by the
Tinrock Mining Company

16:35.143 --> 16:36.011
out of Tucumcari.

16:38.011 --> 16:41.115
They kept it functioning, as
it's the nearest waylay station

16:41.149 --> 16:43.083
between there and the
narrow gauge rails

16:43.116 --> 16:45.120
that service the
mines in that area.

16:48.089 --> 16:51.326
They have something
that belongs to me.

16:55.462 --> 16:56.298
What?

17:00.835 --> 17:03.504
Two years ago I was swindled
out of a mining concession

17:03.538 --> 17:05.507
by those bastards.

17:05.539 --> 17:08.076
My stake was valued at $50,000.

17:11.645 --> 17:13.414
I want my money back.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.818
Well why don't you just
telegraph one of your lawyers

17:17.852 --> 17:18.686
to do the job?

17:20.721 --> 17:22.423
You boys do not read me.

17:23.857 --> 17:26.060
I want what's mine,
and I've got no faith

17:26.094 --> 17:27.996
in this territorial
court system.

17:28.028 --> 17:30.565
Hell, that son of a bitch at
the Tinrock Mining Company

17:30.597 --> 17:32.366
just as soon see
me shot out of hand

17:32.400 --> 17:34.236
by one of his regulators.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.675
What kind of job is this?

17:42.442 --> 17:45.780
Well, boy, it's like this.

17:46.913 --> 17:49.651
Recently I've become
privy to the scheduling

17:49.683 --> 17:52.153
for all the currency
and gold shipments

17:52.185 --> 17:53.721
in this whole territory.

17:53.755 --> 17:56.491
Now in two weeks,
there's to be a shipment

17:56.523 --> 18:01.295
of $60,000 to cover
expenses for equipment

18:01.328 --> 18:04.198
and payroll for six of
the mines in that area.

18:08.803 --> 18:11.640
Your job is to go
into that office

18:13.074 --> 18:15.343
and relieve them of all of it,

18:15.375 --> 18:19.314
using any means at your
discretion, naturally.

18:21.382 --> 18:24.086
We just walk in there?

18:24.919 --> 18:26.321
Mm-hm, yeah.

18:26.354 --> 18:28.890
The town being what it is,
there's hardly a soul to be met.

18:30.391 --> 18:31.793
Hell, the sheriff
and the marshal

18:31.826 --> 18:34.762
were transferred out
of there months ago.

18:34.796 --> 18:37.432
Nah, at best you might
encounter a couple

18:37.464 --> 18:39.733
of the traveling guards
that protect the money,

18:39.767 --> 18:41.769
except that, nah, nobody
wants to go near that place

18:41.803 --> 18:43.204
because of the epidemic,

18:43.237 --> 18:47.275
so in this particular case,
fear can be your ally.

18:49.477 --> 18:52.647
You said there was $60,000
going through that office,

18:53.847 --> 18:55.649
but you're only
looking for $50,000.

18:56.951 --> 19:00.154
You plan on keeping the
extra 10 for yourself?

19:02.522 --> 19:06.727
No, I had intended
for you boys

19:06.760 --> 19:08.529
to split that as your fee.

19:15.068 --> 19:16.570
So let me get this straight.

19:18.005 --> 19:20.708
We walk in there, take the
money off of them guards

19:20.740 --> 19:23.778
using whatever means necessary,

19:25.278 --> 19:29.884
and we bring you back the
50,000, and we clear 5,000 each?

19:31.719 --> 19:33.955
Yeah, that's about
the size of it.

19:33.988 --> 19:36.990
Gentlemen, it'll be a cake walk.

19:37.023 --> 19:41.195
Just get in there, get my
money back, and get out

19:41.229 --> 19:45.400
before humanity returns to
the fair town of Guilt Ridge.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.068
The idea's sound.

19:50.570 --> 19:51.405
Why us?

19:55.442 --> 20:00.382
Because I am not a
highwayman, I'm a businessman.

20:05.152 --> 20:08.056
Now might I assume from the
blank looks on your faces

20:08.088 --> 20:09.390
that we have an agreement?

20:11.224 --> 20:12.059
Hm?

20:15.630 --> 20:17.432
Well, excellent.

20:17.464 --> 20:19.701
And with that,
what's left to say,

20:19.733 --> 20:22.369
other than god's
speed, and, hey.

20:24.438 --> 20:26.908
Why not have a cognac
to seal the deal?

20:52.066 --> 20:56.037
Now why don't you just
get the hell out of here?

21:40.647 --> 21:43.116
Well this is a rare sight.

21:43.150 --> 21:46.821
Can I interest you in a
hoe or a box of nails?

21:48.288 --> 21:51.225
Oh come on, Rose, you know
I hire all that work out.

21:52.727 --> 21:57.532
I will, however, have a
pound of your coffee, please.

21:59.200 --> 22:02.903
Must be real nice being
a polite lady of society.

22:04.070 --> 22:06.406
I'm not trying to
be demeaning, Rose.

22:06.440 --> 22:07.808
Nah, I get it.

22:09.210 --> 22:12.046
Sure wish I had a big strong
man at my beck and call.

22:12.078 --> 22:12.913
Please.

22:16.049 --> 22:18.153
Sorry, Etta, I don't
mean nothing by it.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.189
Dev's gone anyway.

22:21.221 --> 22:23.758
He and Jonas took off on
one of their coon hunts,

22:23.790 --> 22:25.961
and so now I'm all
by my lonesome.

22:26.894 --> 22:28.529
Well where are
they off to now?

22:29.430 --> 22:30.432
I don't know.

22:31.565 --> 22:35.003
Something about a mining
guy named McDonald.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.038
Yeah, meeting him
just south of here

22:38.071 --> 22:39.773
at one of his base camps,

22:39.807 --> 22:42.175
and the boys have been
real secretive about it.

22:43.743 --> 22:46.780
And they said they're gonna be
gone for two weeks this time.

22:46.814 --> 22:49.550
Well hell, that leaves
you a wide open window

22:49.583 --> 22:51.952
to raise hell with
that fresh little tart

22:51.986 --> 22:53.722
Jonas takes a fancy to.

22:54.922 --> 22:58.358
Two good-looking dames
with money and freedom.

22:58.392 --> 22:59.361
Stop it, Rosie.

23:00.661 --> 23:02.663
I don't mind telling you
that I'm mighty worried

23:02.696 --> 23:04.231
about something this time.

23:04.265 --> 23:05.466
What?

23:05.499 --> 23:06.901
I don't know, it's
just an intuition,

23:06.933 --> 23:09.369
like they're stepping
into something

23:09.403 --> 23:10.739
too big for them to handle.

23:14.541 --> 23:17.578
You know, when I
was a young girl,

23:18.746 --> 23:20.448
my daddy moved me
out to this country.

23:24.585 --> 23:27.689
He had a job with
Grenville Dodge.

23:27.721 --> 23:30.258
They were building the
Central Pacific Railroad.

23:30.290 --> 23:31.125
Etta.

23:32.460 --> 23:33.627
Do you love Dev?

23:35.962 --> 23:38.865
When I was a young girl
in those railroad camps,

23:38.898 --> 23:41.535
I dreamed of owning a
fine home in Boston.

23:43.604 --> 23:46.641
Lace curtains and
crystal chandeliers.

23:46.673 --> 23:48.410
Do you love Dev, damn it?

23:51.679 --> 23:52.514
Yes.

23:54.147 --> 23:55.549
But I don't love his ideas,

23:56.450 --> 23:57.919
which are Jonas's ideas.

23:59.653 --> 24:04.625
And damn, if he ain't
loyal to that old dog.

24:05.759 --> 24:07.528
Didn't Jonas save
his life or something?

24:08.596 --> 24:09.631
Supposedly.

24:11.030 --> 24:13.233
The most important thing
is that I know he loves me.

24:14.868 --> 24:19.173
And lord knows I've set out
to leave him more than once.

24:20.875 --> 24:22.576
Did you say those
boys are meeting up

24:22.609 --> 24:24.011
with someone named McDonald?

24:25.145 --> 24:25.980
That's right.

24:29.383 --> 24:30.351
What is it, Rosie?

24:33.086 --> 24:36.023
Well, last night, I was
at the White Elephant,

24:37.458 --> 24:39.360
and while I was
sipping my tequila,

24:39.393 --> 24:42.096
I heard a conversation
at the next table.

24:43.297 --> 24:46.300
These three fellas
all wearing suits

24:47.300 --> 24:48.735
kept mentioning that name.

24:48.769 --> 24:50.371
- What name?
- McDonald.

24:51.505 --> 24:54.942
Three real highbrow
citified types.

24:54.974 --> 24:56.910
They kept talking
about this McDonald

24:56.943 --> 24:59.146
getting the surprise
of his life.

24:59.180 --> 25:00.715
So...

25:00.748 --> 25:02.950
Like they was setting
up an ambush or something.

25:02.982 --> 25:04.318
Oh god, Rosie.

25:05.451 --> 25:06.688
Do you think...

27:23.691 --> 27:24.792
Let's check it out.

27:43.242 --> 27:45.346
You think McDonald has
this thing clocked?

27:47.981 --> 27:49.416
Sure.

27:49.450 --> 27:52.586
Hell, easy, he's
a smart bastard.

27:52.618 --> 27:53.487
Get high toned.

27:55.288 --> 27:57.090
Don't mind telling you
I'm still sore as hell

27:57.124 --> 27:59.460
about that Mexican rifle job.

27:59.492 --> 28:01.461
Never should've
trusted those officers.

28:02.730 --> 28:04.999
Well how was I to know they
was gonna come up short, Dev?

28:05.031 --> 28:06.166
Short?

28:06.200 --> 28:08.869
Those bastards never
figured on paying us at all.

28:08.902 --> 28:10.805
But
they gave us their word.

28:10.837 --> 28:12.740
Yeah, a fat lot
of good that did us.

28:15.041 --> 28:19.079
I remember in General Miles'
regiment, those two officers.

28:19.113 --> 28:22.182
Yeah, loaded with hot air,
full of liquid courage,

28:22.215 --> 28:25.218
just couldn't wait to read
their names in the dispatches.

28:25.251 --> 28:27.253
I'm telling you, Jonas,
they're all the same,

28:27.287 --> 28:28.756
it doesn't matter what army.

28:30.089 --> 28:32.893
Well don't be a
gooseberry about it, Dev.

28:32.925 --> 28:35.695
We'll recoup our losses
on this job tenfold,

28:35.729 --> 28:38.566
and then it's off to
Galveston and the gals.

28:40.834 --> 28:44.505
I wish I was in a warm
porcelain tub with Etta right now.

28:46.839 --> 28:48.009
You'd just be,

28:49.476 --> 28:51.312
well, what's the word, I
don't know how you'd say it.

28:51.345 --> 28:54.081
You'd just be there
doing nothing,

28:54.114 --> 28:56.384
'cause you're in the tub
with Etta, doing nothing.

28:56.416 --> 28:57.617
What's that called?

28:57.651 --> 28:58.552
Ennui.

28:58.585 --> 28:59.420
Huh?

29:00.487 --> 29:02.823
You're talking about ennui.

29:02.855 --> 29:04.258
- What's that?
- Forget it.

29:10.263 --> 29:12.298
Well we've had some
good scores, too.

29:12.332 --> 29:13.934
Sure.

29:13.967 --> 29:15.403
I mean it.

29:15.435 --> 29:18.740
When they throw me in that pine
box, I won't regret a thing.

29:20.941 --> 29:22.043
It's a good life.

29:23.443 --> 29:26.913
Well, a man's life does
not belong to himself.

29:32.249 --> 29:33.753
I remember that
bastard we met up with,

29:33.787 --> 29:35.722
right after we mustered
out of the ninth.

29:35.756 --> 29:37.158
Yeah, who was that?

29:37.191 --> 29:40.661
You know, that peckerwood
that owned all them riverboats.

29:40.693 --> 29:42.195
- Mississippi?
- Yeah.

29:42.229 --> 29:45.266
Sure, when you had that
great idea for a pig farm.

29:45.298 --> 29:47.033
Jesus Christ.

29:47.067 --> 29:49.103
The idea was sound.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.403
Uh-huh.

29:52.705 --> 29:55.308
Well we made some money
off of that fella anyways.

29:56.542 --> 29:57.377
Yep.

29:58.811 --> 30:01.748
Recall he had a complete
library of Samuel Johnson.

30:03.182 --> 30:05.886
I never figured him for being
a double dealer and a snake.

30:08.788 --> 30:13.193
Yeah, I hear tell
he came out here west

30:13.227 --> 30:14.495
and got into the
mining business,

30:14.528 --> 30:17.397
just like that dear
friend McDonald.

30:18.531 --> 30:20.567
Well he had some
peculiar ways,

30:22.502 --> 30:24.371
most of which weren't
exactly legal.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.910
We did what we had to do.

30:29.942 --> 30:31.878
The bastard sent
us into an ambush.

30:33.079 --> 30:35.249
To him, we were expendable.

30:37.550 --> 30:38.519
You think he knew?

30:39.819 --> 30:40.654
Yeah, probably.

30:42.823 --> 30:45.126
Well, still, we
got him his silver.

30:45.159 --> 30:45.960
Yeah.

30:47.661 --> 30:50.297
Took quite a hunk
of it for ourselves.

30:50.329 --> 30:51.566
That was our first stake.

30:54.835 --> 30:57.305
I'd like to think we
taught that fella a lesson.

30:59.873 --> 31:01.375
Hey, remember riding back

31:01.407 --> 31:04.144
with the canteens
all shot to hell,

31:05.311 --> 31:08.048
with a pebble in
my mouth for spit.

31:09.482 --> 31:10.417
You taught me that.

31:11.585 --> 31:13.888
Well a man can only
die when he's careless.

31:14.954 --> 31:16.856
Yeah, still.

31:16.890 --> 31:19.860
I'd like to meet up
with that rounder.

31:19.893 --> 31:21.929
10 years, let it go.

31:21.961 --> 31:25.766
I recall being chased by
those inbred Cajuns of his,

31:25.798 --> 31:29.235
like they was a bunch
of screaming coyotes.

31:29.269 --> 31:33.574
Yep, bastard sure
sent us into harm's way.

31:33.606 --> 31:34.808
Still, I wasn't worried.

31:35.808 --> 31:37.278
Why?

31:37.310 --> 31:38.178
You were there.

31:41.381 --> 31:45.586
Yeah, we do tend to get
ourselves out of these scrapes.

31:45.618 --> 31:46.419
Yep.

31:47.854 --> 31:51.959
Still, I'd like to settle
up with that peckerwood.

31:53.926 --> 31:56.696
Tell you what, I'll
shoot him for you.

31:57.998 --> 32:00.000
Now mount up, let's get
the hell out of here.

32:00.032 --> 32:01.334
All right then.

32:55.521 --> 32:58.725
I don't know about this,
leaving the horses back here.

33:00.259 --> 33:02.063
It's out of sight, it's sound.

33:03.396 --> 33:08.402
I don't know.

33:10.136 --> 33:12.472
It's gonna be a cake walk.

33:20.079 --> 33:21.081
Cake walk.

33:23.016 --> 33:23.851
Cake walk.

33:46.506 --> 33:47.675
Reach.

33:47.708 --> 33:50.111
Don't even think
about being heroes.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.212
Tie them up.

33:53.713 --> 33:56.850
Now don't make me beat one
of you bastards senseless.

33:58.285 --> 34:01.255
Now boys, where
are those bags?

34:02.622 --> 34:04.625
You fellas are in a bad box,

34:04.657 --> 34:06.693
'cause I got me an
itchy trigger finger.

34:15.902 --> 34:16.771
Cake walk.

34:20.706 --> 34:23.376
Well let's not
start celebrating just yet.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.811
This town makes me nervous.

34:24.844 --> 34:26.646
There's no one here.

34:26.679 --> 34:28.348
Exactly.

34:41.695 --> 34:45.099
What an idea, leaving
the horses out of sight.

34:45.132 --> 34:46.434
My idea was sound.

35:41.887 --> 35:44.857
I bet you're getting
angry right about now.

35:44.891 --> 35:49.063
That don't even capture
the spirit of the thing.

36:18.492 --> 36:20.227
Never thought I'd be this age,

36:20.260 --> 36:22.430
and caught up in a
hornet's nest like this.

36:29.635 --> 36:31.838
Next time something sounds
too good to be true,

36:31.871 --> 36:33.373
you talk me out of it.

36:55.695 --> 36:58.298
Who are those
regulators, do you think?

36:59.331 --> 37:00.567
I don't rightly know.

37:02.735 --> 37:05.438
Maybe they knew McDonald
was gonna hit this payroll.

37:09.309 --> 37:11.945
Yeah, we'll get out
of this, you'll see.

37:11.978 --> 37:14.815
In no time at all, we'll
be back with Etta and Belle

37:14.847 --> 37:18.317
with enough loot to
raise hell in Santa Fe.

37:25.958 --> 37:28.895
You know, Belle says
old Moe's about ready

37:28.929 --> 37:32.733
to sell the tack and feed,
we could make him an offer.

37:32.766 --> 37:36.604
That's just what I need,
something to tie me down again.

37:37.804 --> 37:39.840
I already had that
life once before,

37:39.873 --> 37:41.242
and I ain't cut out for it.

37:56.956 --> 37:58.157
You remember the hardware store?

37:58.190 --> 37:59.893
Come on, come on, Dev.

38:01.126 --> 38:03.230
Winnie was a good woman
for you in those days.

38:04.130 --> 38:07.067
If you would've just stuck.

38:07.099 --> 38:10.304
I spent too long with
you and General Miles,

38:10.336 --> 38:13.639
chasing hopped-up Sioux
to settle for a life

38:13.672 --> 38:18.645
of selling nails and pans to
those stiff-necked Mormons.

38:20.079 --> 38:22.715
Cheapest bastards I ever seen.

38:22.748 --> 38:24.717
Cheat you faster than
a snake oil seller

38:24.751 --> 38:26.453
if he wasn't one of them.

38:32.659 --> 38:36.262
Still, I suppose I should be
grateful to that church elder

38:36.295 --> 38:37.797
that took a fancy to Winnie.

38:39.199 --> 38:40.867
Solved that problem.

38:40.900 --> 38:43.704
Hear tell he took her to wife
on top of his other three.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.205
Maybe she finally got kids

38:46.239 --> 38:48.608
out of that frog-walking
son of a bitch.

39:18.637 --> 39:21.674
Anyway, what's wrong
with parlaying this score

39:21.708 --> 39:24.244
into a real future?

39:25.411 --> 39:26.846
We've talked about
it long enough.

39:34.487 --> 39:37.324
How many years
we go back together?

39:37.356 --> 39:39.293
20, maybe more.

39:41.860 --> 39:43.029
Seems like always.

39:51.438 --> 39:52.271
Shit.

40:10.956 --> 40:14.326
Problem is, your ideas
never seem to pan out.

40:14.360 --> 40:18.265
'Cause just like with Winnie,
you never gave it your all.

40:18.297 --> 40:19.899
My ideas was sound.

40:21.835 --> 40:22.670
Yeah.

40:24.070 --> 40:26.440
Like those two rope drummer
jobs you got us in Holdenville.

40:26.472 --> 40:28.507
- They was hard to come by.
- Yeah, so was the supplier,

40:28.541 --> 40:30.210
was drunk in Abilene
all the time.

40:30.242 --> 40:32.645
- Well at least...
- Jesus Christ.

40:32.679 --> 40:35.282
I tried, which is
more than I can say

40:35.315 --> 40:36.517
for the likes of you.

40:40.786 --> 40:43.289
Well, I kinda got my mind

40:43.322 --> 40:46.926
on other things now, Jonas.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.530
I'm just thinking
positive, you golden bastard.

40:52.498 --> 40:55.068
If I could get you off
memory lane for one minute,

40:56.202 --> 40:57.705
I think I just
realized something.

40:59.405 --> 41:00.207
Yeah?

41:07.313 --> 41:09.516
Those fellas saw us walk

41:09.548 --> 41:11.117
past the boarding house, right?

41:12.485 --> 41:13.920
Right.

41:13.952 --> 41:17.958
Well, we came in
from the south of town.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.295
They probably don't
know that we got Tops

41:22.327 --> 41:23.931
and Bristol tied up in the back.

41:27.467 --> 41:29.869
They probably don't even
know it's only two of us.

41:29.902 --> 41:32.338
Hell, they never went in
and untied those guards.

41:34.306 --> 41:36.242
Now who's the pipe dreamer?

41:37.643 --> 41:41.614
What I'm saying is, if
we could get to the horses,

41:42.849 --> 41:44.718
we could get to the
wash north of town.

41:45.617 --> 41:47.286
Then that puts us in the hills.

41:49.956 --> 41:51.423
And?

41:51.456 --> 41:56.395
Well, I figure there's a
dozen or more of those fellas,

41:58.463 --> 42:00.333
if I counted their
rifles correctly.

42:01.501 --> 42:03.136
And two of us
stand a better chance

42:03.168 --> 42:06.539
of skedaddling up that
mountain than a dozen or so?

42:06.572 --> 42:07.473
Precisely.

42:09.576 --> 42:10.577
Could work.

42:10.610 --> 42:11.445
Come on.

42:12.612 --> 42:15.349
You were always a
glass half full guy.

42:16.748 --> 42:21.087
Besides, our options are
somewhat limited right now.

42:22.487 --> 42:26.025
I told you years ago, when
you pointed me in the direction

42:26.059 --> 42:28.295
of them screaming Lakotas,
I'd follow you into hell

42:28.327 --> 42:29.730
unless you say different.

42:35.467 --> 42:38.070
We'll split up when
we get to the ridge.

42:41.440 --> 42:44.443
After the fork, the
roads run parallel.

42:48.614 --> 42:52.551
I'll see you in McDonald's,
come hell or high water.

42:57.389 --> 43:01.694
No matter what happens,
one or the other rides on.

43:03.295 --> 43:05.631
At least one of us makes it.

43:08.902 --> 43:09.735
Let's go.

43:44.137 --> 43:44.972
Yoo-hoo.

44:09.594 --> 44:10.429
Dev.

45:03.181 --> 45:04.016
Shit.

45:59.572 --> 46:00.874
Son of a bitch.

46:12.117 --> 46:12.918
Dev.

49:07.525 --> 49:08.694
I'm sore as hell at you.

49:08.728 --> 49:10.697
- My idea was...
- I don't wanna hear it!

49:19.905 --> 49:21.441
Let's get the hell out of here.

52:20.952 --> 52:22.889
Yellow bastard.

52:22.922 --> 52:24.590
Don't move.

52:24.623 --> 52:25.458
Drop it.

52:29.461 --> 52:31.797
Where's
your partner?

52:31.831 --> 52:33.766
You said this was
to be a cake walk.

52:33.798 --> 52:35.534
Last time I saw
that many rifles,

52:35.568 --> 52:38.171
they was in the
hands of Comancheros.

52:38.204 --> 52:40.773
Well just take it easy.

52:40.806 --> 52:42.775
Lower your weapon.

52:42.807 --> 52:46.112
Surely you boys know the risks
involved in your vocation.

52:46.144 --> 52:47.713
I just pull the strings.

52:47.746 --> 52:50.083
Dev was my
friend, god damn it.

52:51.250 --> 52:53.052
I'm gonna put a bullet
right in your brain pan

52:53.085 --> 52:54.019
right the hell now.

52:55.521 --> 52:57.156
Prepare to meet your maker.

52:57.188 --> 52:59.658
My demise may not come
from your gun, my friend.

53:03.094 --> 53:04.696
Well I'm gonna guess
that you boys ran

53:04.730 --> 53:06.632
into the Tinrock regulators.

53:06.664 --> 53:08.067
Now just how do you know that?

53:09.702 --> 53:11.370
Why don't you just turn
around and take a look?

53:11.402 --> 53:14.539
Apparently they followed
you all the way back.

53:14.572 --> 53:16.375
You think I'm
gonna fall for that?

53:17.476 --> 53:19.878
I ain't your puppet,
Mr. McDonald.

53:19.911 --> 53:21.847
I assure you,
this is no trick.

53:21.880 --> 53:24.783
Your carelessness has led
them right back here to us.

53:31.257 --> 53:32.258
Well shit.

53:33.759 --> 53:35.927
You know those boys
would just as soon

53:35.960 --> 53:37.496
see me eliminated as you.

53:38.898 --> 53:41.467
Unfortunately for both of us,
I dispatched my own guards

53:41.500 --> 53:42.869
to deliver our latest strike,

53:42.902 --> 53:46.505
so it's just you and me,

53:47.907 --> 53:50.175
and our best chance
is an alliance.

54:01.820 --> 54:03.556
I make it a policy
never to be more

54:03.588 --> 54:05.858
than just a few steps
away from a Henry.

54:06.992 --> 54:09.195
I hope to god you're
proficient with a rifle.

54:16.135 --> 54:18.037
All right, you'll find an
array of rifles over there

54:18.070 --> 54:19.372
and some cartridges over there.

54:19.405 --> 54:20.907
Just grab yourself one.

54:22.974 --> 54:25.644
Ah, those sneaky bastards will
think I'm probably holed up

54:25.677 --> 54:28.047
over there in the
rooming houses.

54:28.079 --> 54:29.081
What
about your guards?

54:29.114 --> 54:30.650
When are they due back?

54:31.916 --> 54:33.452
I don't know, maybe tomorrow.

54:35.621 --> 54:37.490
Depends on the road conditions.

54:39.458 --> 54:41.494
Those regulators, I'm sure,
got it all figured out,

54:41.527 --> 54:42.628
we're all alone.

54:50.402 --> 54:52.005
That's not exactly reassuring.

54:53.137 --> 54:56.708
My friend, one must
revel in self-confidence

54:56.742 --> 54:59.245
when staring down adversity.

54:59.277 --> 55:00.980
Yeah, well let's
see how them $10 words

55:01.012 --> 55:02.614
get you out of this.

55:09.788 --> 55:12.592
What's to keep me from plugging
you right here and now?

55:12.625 --> 55:14.126
I don't have anything to lose.

55:15.628 --> 55:16.596
You won't.

55:17.596 --> 55:20.199
You need me, I need you.

55:26.005 --> 55:28.608
Expediency is the
watchword of the moment.

55:30.009 --> 55:33.445
And more importantly, you don't
strike me as the kind of man

55:33.478 --> 55:36.281
who'd just wanna
roll over and die

55:36.315 --> 55:38.318
without putting up
some kind of a fight.

55:39.318 --> 55:41.287
Where'd them peckerwoods go?

55:41.320 --> 55:42.956
You think they rode off?

55:45.090 --> 55:46.358
I think they're over there

55:46.391 --> 55:48.326
looking around in
my rooming house.

55:48.360 --> 55:50.028
They wouldn't suspect
us coming out here

55:50.061 --> 55:51.364
so close to the mines.

55:53.865 --> 55:54.701
Why?

55:55.900 --> 55:56.969
Well, the dynamite.

55:57.835 --> 55:58.670
Huh?

55:59.871 --> 56:02.440
This is where we
store all the dynamite.

56:02.474 --> 56:05.277
Shit, you mean they
could blow us up?

56:05.309 --> 56:08.547
Not without detonators.

56:08.579 --> 56:10.849
Oh, I suppose a stray
bullet could hit a barrel,

56:10.882 --> 56:14.886
but if they wander out
this way, I'm sure they'll,

56:16.088 --> 56:18.958
they'll see that, and
they'll take caution.

56:18.990 --> 56:20.259
Yeah, we're
probably gonna get

56:20.291 --> 56:21.760
our asses blown off.

56:23.762 --> 56:26.265
A calculated risk.

56:26.297 --> 56:27.899
One should always take refuge

56:27.932 --> 56:29.501
in the zone of the most danger.

56:29.534 --> 56:31.336
It throws your opponent off.

56:32.538 --> 56:35.141
You never think about
being a poker player?

56:35.173 --> 56:36.942
I was.

56:36.974 --> 56:39.344
I was 13 years old.

56:39.378 --> 56:41.713
Made a pretty good penny of
it, too, on the riverboats,

56:41.746 --> 56:45.283
but that was back
before the war.

56:46.418 --> 56:47.686
I don't know how them
fellas followed me,

56:47.719 --> 56:50.422
there was nobody
up on that ridge.

56:50.456 --> 56:52.291
The army cut a new bypass

56:52.324 --> 56:54.494
through that canyon
two months ago,

56:55.360 --> 56:56.929
and I bet you didn't know that.

56:57.795 --> 56:58.630
I didn't.

57:00.733 --> 57:01.534
We didn't.

57:07.606 --> 57:10.042
You boys should've done more
research before you set out.

57:10.074 --> 57:11.509
Listen here, you son of a...

57:11.543 --> 57:13.945
Holy hell, I
forgot about Myra.

57:23.889 --> 57:26.559
Well, looky what we have here.

57:40.005 --> 57:40.840
Oh shit.

57:51.516 --> 57:53.219
You never stood a chance.

57:54.652 --> 57:58.023
Wow, she
can take care of herself.

58:02.427 --> 58:03.662
Have you come to
terms with your life

58:03.695 --> 58:05.565
in the event that it
should end suddenly?

58:06.532 --> 58:07.365
Huh?

58:17.809 --> 58:22.081
Well I think I can answer
for all I've ever done.

58:27.186 --> 58:30.356
When I was a little boy, they
sent me to live with my uncle

58:30.389 --> 58:32.091
on his farm in Kentucky.

58:35.594 --> 58:37.463
God, he was a
miserable old cuss.

58:39.164 --> 58:43.736
He used to beat his
field hands for no reason.

58:44.802 --> 58:48.873
But I learned, I
learned from that moment

58:48.907 --> 58:51.076
that I needed to be the
man that pulled the string.

58:51.108 --> 58:56.114
So when I was 10 years old,
ran away and never looked back.

58:57.282 --> 58:58.550
Taught myself how
to read and write

58:58.583 --> 59:01.219
with the help of a
house servant negro.

59:05.224 --> 59:07.660
Cotton farm, he hid me
out in the slave quarters

59:07.693 --> 59:09.262
on a nearby plantation.

59:14.298 --> 59:15.567
Good old Silas.

59:18.036 --> 59:19.704
You know what he
used to tell me?

59:20.572 --> 59:21.574
He used to swear

59:23.407 --> 59:26.945
that he was a grandson of,

59:26.978 --> 59:30.682
get it.

59:30.715 --> 59:32.150
He used to swear
he was a grandson

59:32.184 --> 59:34.820
of Tom Jefferson's housemaid.

59:34.853 --> 59:35.954
Can you believe that?

59:38.556 --> 59:39.991
How'd you get all this?

59:45.163 --> 59:48.367
Resourcefulness, moxie.

59:52.036 --> 59:53.371
Laughing at fear.

59:57.742 --> 59:59.577
I just did what I had
to do to make sure

59:59.610 --> 01:00:04.616
I never had to go back
behind a plow and a mule.

01:00:05.751 --> 01:00:08.854
- Not that there's anything...
- Yeah.

01:00:08.887 --> 01:00:11.990
You made a lot of money,
didn't you, Mr. McDonald?

01:00:13.992 --> 01:00:15.628
You may be a great man.

01:00:17.996 --> 01:00:20.132
Seems you're no different
than Dev and me.

01:00:23.501 --> 01:00:26.137
Don't you think all
great men bend the rules

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:27.172
to suit their needs?

01:00:29.474 --> 01:00:31.677
Now I have never
openly broken the law,

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:35.615
but there's been times when
I needed to circumvent it.

01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:39.150
Laws can be so subjective.

01:00:40.619 --> 01:00:43.923
Yeah, yeah, you're
rich, I'll give you that.

01:00:46.324 --> 01:00:49.193
Yeah, yeah, I guess
you could say that,

01:00:49.226 --> 01:00:51.362
but you know what's
stuck in the craw

01:00:51.396 --> 01:00:54.033
of most of the men
out in this territory?

01:00:54.065 --> 01:00:56.401
It's when they discovered
I'd been sending blankets

01:00:56.434 --> 01:01:00.471
and supplies to Geronimo's band.

01:01:00.505 --> 01:01:01.673
That thieving renegade?

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:05.077
The army even chased
him down to Mexico,

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:06.278
why the hell you do that?

01:01:06.311 --> 01:01:09.081
Now that is exactly
the same attitude

01:01:09.114 --> 01:01:10.882
that General Crook
had towards me.

01:01:12.985 --> 01:01:15.253
These people have a
right to their lands.

01:01:15.286 --> 01:01:18.023
We're the ones that have
created this situation.

01:01:19.358 --> 01:01:23.262
Yeah, well, they're thieving,
murdering, raping thugs.

01:01:24.396 --> 01:01:25.831
Depends on how you look at it.

01:01:25.864 --> 01:01:27.632
Hey, hey, hang on.

01:01:27.666 --> 01:01:29.201
I think I saw something
move out there.

01:01:29.233 --> 01:01:30.635
Just hang on, hang on.

01:01:32.269 --> 01:01:33.105
All right.

01:01:38.643 --> 01:01:43.148
All right, just wait
'till I give the signal,

01:01:43.181 --> 01:01:45.284
and then we'll open fire.

01:02:13.978 --> 01:02:15.013
Right now.

01:02:47.012 --> 01:02:51.016
Well, if they didn't
know where we were before,

01:02:51.048 --> 01:02:52.684
they sure as hell know now.

01:02:53.684 --> 01:02:54.953
Hell, I got two of them.

01:02:56.188 --> 01:02:58.257
Yes, you did, indeed.

01:02:58.289 --> 01:03:01.192
Remind me to present you with
a handful of Henry Clay cigars

01:03:01.226 --> 01:03:02.994
when we get out of this mess.

01:03:04.929 --> 01:03:08.599
Listen, I just saw two of
those J-hots go over there

01:03:08.632 --> 01:03:09.901
by the assay office.

01:03:10.469 --> 01:03:12.037
I'm gonna have to
go out on the porch

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:13.372
to draw a good bead on them.

01:03:13.405 --> 01:03:15.240
Yeah, supposing you get shot?

01:03:18.043 --> 01:03:19.945
Well then you're on your own.

01:04:41.193 --> 01:04:44.028
That crazy son of a bitch
is gonna get himself killed

01:04:44.061 --> 01:04:45.096
one of these days.

01:04:46.797 --> 01:04:47.932
Thank god for me.

01:05:11.856 --> 01:05:14.693
Gentlemen, kiss
your asses goodbye.

01:05:16.027 --> 01:05:16.862
I'm out.

01:05:28.273 --> 01:05:29.675
Shit fire!

01:06:17.389 --> 01:06:18.757
I about thought you
weren't gonna make it

01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:20.458
and I'd have to shoot
them all myself.

01:06:20.492 --> 01:06:23.695
Had you
figured for dead, my friend.

01:06:23.728 --> 01:06:25.664
Why in the hell
would you think that?

01:06:27.097 --> 01:06:29.500
'Cause I saw you
shot off this horse.

01:06:35.106 --> 01:06:36.208
There's the scratch.

01:06:37.976 --> 01:06:39.811
Bastards just winged me.

01:06:39.844 --> 01:06:41.813
Kinda knocked the wind
out of me, though.

01:06:41.846 --> 01:06:43.414
What the hell were you
playing at out there?

01:06:43.447 --> 01:06:45.116
Last looks, you was
laying on the ground.

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:47.818
You remember that
hostage trade with Cochise

01:06:47.851 --> 01:06:49.320
when you played dead?

01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:51.355
- Yeah.
- Yeah, same idea.

01:06:51.389 --> 01:06:52.691
I just wanted to
get some distance

01:06:52.724 --> 01:06:54.426
between those bastards and me.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.032
Then I'd come in from
behind, like deus ex machina.

01:07:00.065 --> 01:07:00.898
Huh?

01:07:00.931 --> 01:07:02.500
It's a Greek thing.

01:07:02.534 --> 01:07:03.669
Oh, yeah.

01:07:04.835 --> 01:07:07.138
Mighty grateful
for your timing.

01:07:07.172 --> 01:07:09.608
You know, the boss
of these regulator boys

01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:11.476
is gonna be mighty
fired up at you.

01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:15.281
My problem.

01:07:16.213 --> 01:07:18.683
Now, about our fee.

01:07:22.686 --> 01:07:23.822
Who the hell is that?

01:07:29.059 --> 01:07:30.395
Well I'll be damned.

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.902
I might've figured.

01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:48.113
One day, you and I are gonna
kill each other, McDonald.

01:07:49.581 --> 01:07:50.416
Yeah.

01:07:51.682 --> 01:07:54.186
The world will little
mourn the loss.

01:07:54.219 --> 01:07:56.722
Oh, looks like we lightened up

01:07:56.755 --> 01:07:58.657
your payroll obligations some.

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:01.792
Yep.

01:08:01.826 --> 01:08:04.128
Cost of doing business, Mac.

01:08:08.365 --> 01:08:10.369
Just a damn minute.

01:08:10.402 --> 01:08:11.836
Don't I know the two of you?

01:08:14.706 --> 01:08:18.010
You be Bo Huntington
out of Mississippi, right?

01:08:19.411 --> 01:08:21.444
Dev, it's that son of a
bitch from the riverboat job.

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:23.346
He's older, but it's him!

01:08:23.381 --> 01:08:24.582
There.

01:08:24.615 --> 01:08:26.283
Ah, you two don't
look any prettier

01:08:26.317 --> 01:08:28.252
after all these years, either.

01:08:28.286 --> 01:08:30.087
Had I known you
were involved in this,

01:08:30.121 --> 01:08:32.090
I might've expected an ambush.

01:08:32.122 --> 01:08:34.591
So you boys are all
acquainted with each other?

01:08:38.261 --> 01:08:40.399
- Bastard!
- Ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:08:41.599 --> 01:08:43.268
Had the bad sense
of hiring these two

01:08:43.301 --> 01:08:45.537
when they mustered out
of the military, Mac.

01:08:47.337 --> 01:08:50.006
They was flies in the
buttermilk even back then.

01:08:52.243 --> 01:08:56.413
So the competition
continues between the Tinrock

01:08:57.715 --> 01:08:59.417
and the McDonald
mining companies.

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:04.856
Now it's three against one,

01:09:04.889 --> 01:09:07.693
unless you got any men left
hiding over that ridge.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:12.331
Nah, you cleaned
me out today, Mac.

01:09:14.599 --> 01:09:17.402
So, now what?

01:09:17.435 --> 01:09:21.173
Well, I have a
great sense of timing,

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.011
especially when it concerns
the right time to ride off.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.983
Maybe one day we
will kill each other,

01:09:32.015 --> 01:09:35.086
you goat-dancing bastard.

01:09:38.988 --> 01:09:39.823
Possible.

01:09:40.992 --> 01:09:43.662
I think we both got a
heap of living left,

01:09:43.694 --> 01:09:44.895
you old son of a bitch.

01:09:46.296 --> 01:09:50.667
So to you boys, I say goodbye.

01:09:54.203 --> 01:09:55.039
Come on.

01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:14.158
I should've shot
that son of a bitch.

01:10:14.192 --> 01:10:16.528
Uh-huh.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.530
Well, meet me over
at the assay office

01:10:19.564 --> 01:10:21.099
and we'll divvy up.

01:10:22.533 --> 01:10:25.737
I do believe you boys are
due some sort of bonus.

01:10:27.939 --> 01:10:29.374
I'll see you over there.

01:10:29.407 --> 01:10:33.878
And hey, maybe we'll drink
us some of that cognac again.

01:10:37.948 --> 01:10:40.249
Yeah, I prefer tequila.

01:10:42.386 --> 01:10:45.090
Hey Jonas, I got an idea.

01:10:45.122 --> 01:10:45.923
What?

01:10:47.792 --> 01:10:51.029
Let's grab that
drink, get our money.

01:10:51.061 --> 01:10:52.296
And?

01:10:52.329 --> 01:10:53.631
And let's get the
hell out of here,

01:10:53.664 --> 01:10:55.699
and go back to Belle and Etta.

01:10:55.733 --> 01:10:58.670
Now that is a sound idea, Dev.

01:11:00.238 --> 01:11:03.108
We can all four of us
go down to Galveston,

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.109
maybe New Orleans.

01:11:05.143 --> 01:11:07.345
Didn't you say that
Belle needs a new hat?

01:11:07.377 --> 01:11:08.313
That I did.

01:11:10.948 --> 01:11:14.485
Let's go.

01:14:03.955 --> 01:14:08.955
