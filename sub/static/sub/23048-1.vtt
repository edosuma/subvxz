Darkland

00:45.789 --> 00:53.246
A film by Fenar Ahmad

01:19.372 --> 01:23.788
Breathe. Breath.
What are you nervous about?

01:25.747 --> 01:27.955
Breathe.

01:33.789 --> 01:36.621
Close your eyes and relax.

01:37.539 --> 01:39.621
Breathe.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.955
Close your eyes and relax.

01:48.539 --> 01:50.746
Breathe.

01:52.914 --> 01:57.288
Wake up! Why are your eyes closed?
You're not on fucking vacation!

01:57.414 --> 01:59.996
Are you stupid, brother?

02:00.706 --> 02:03.746
- Here.
- I just know this will get screwed up.

02:03.872 --> 02:07.663
If you screw this up, I'll feel
really sorry for you? Do you get that?!

02:07.789 --> 02:13.288
- Yes.
- Put on the fucking gloves.

02:13.414 --> 02:16.871
Come on. Don't look around.
Go straight into the bank.

02:16.997 --> 02:19.621
Come on. Come on. Come on.

02:19.747 --> 02:25.205
Get inside. Empty. Fill. Yallah, go!
Don't think too much.

02:25.331 --> 02:28.246
- Where's the bag?
- Ten seconds.

02:28.372 --> 02:32.705
Yallah. Let's roll.
Yallah, traffic.

03:05.622 --> 03:09.288
This is a robbery!
Give me the money!

03:10.497 --> 03:12.996
Hurry up!
Come on!

03:14.747 --> 03:18.996
- Are you deaf? Give me the money!
- It won't open. Go through the back.

04:24.872 --> 04:27.496
A little further out to the side.

04:30.747 --> 04:33.080
Yes, thank you.

04:34.081 --> 04:37.538
Retracting plier.
Pacer is well-functioning.

04:37.664 --> 04:39.663
And stand by.

04:46.081 --> 04:49.330
- And we have a heartbeat.
- That just never gets old.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.955
Unstable, but lets see what happens.

04:53.081 --> 04:56.705
And we have a fin sinus rhythm.
The patient is stable. Carry on.

04:56.831 --> 05:01.246
Let's close him.
Come here.

05:04.664 --> 05:08.705
- I think we can call it a day.
- Thank you.

05:08.831 --> 05:12.538
- Nice work, everyone.
- Say hi to Stine for me.

07:00.081 --> 07:01.871
Cheers!

07:01.997 --> 07:06.038
- We're so happy you could all make it.
- Thanks for having us! Congratulations.

07:06.164 --> 07:08.621
- Thanks.
- Great job!

07:08.747 --> 07:12.496
- Stine, how far along are you?
- Hey, we were talking about me.

07:12.622 --> 07:17.413
- We we'll get to you.
- This is all your fault. Seven months.

07:17.539 --> 07:23.205
- And there are two, right? Double up.
- There's only one in the scan.

07:23.331 --> 07:25.705
- May we see it?
- Yes, show them.

07:25.831 --> 07:30.121
- Come on! Let's see it.
- We want to see embryo pictures!

07:30.247 --> 07:35.663
- It's a boy. An anatomical freak.
- What are you talking about?

07:35.789 --> 07:39.496
- Huge penis.
- Oh my God...

07:39.622 --> 07:42.913
- That's the umbilical cord.
- It's a penis.

07:43.039 --> 07:48.996
Look how cute he is already
with his little nose and mouth.

07:49.122 --> 07:50.996
It's the umbilical cord.

07:51.122 --> 07:57.913
- I'm gettin' drunk...
- And so you should, honey.

07:58.039 --> 08:02.830
- Right. I'm just sayin'.
- It's great, honey.

08:04.706 --> 08:07.163
- When are you off to France?
- Friday.

08:07.289 --> 08:10.913
- What? Seriously? Where to?
- Cote d'Azur.

08:11.039 --> 08:16.621
- I hope you're not...
- You were just in the Caribbean.

08:16.747 --> 08:21.621
- It's just for two days.
- In and out, as they say.

08:21.747 --> 08:24.663
- A weekend trip.
- Put away your phone, honey.

08:31.664 --> 08:35.913
- It's at an old shipyard.
- What did I miss?

08:36.039 --> 08:40.913
- He must know everything.
- Afraid of missing out on an event.

08:49.122 --> 08:51.663
- Is there cake?
- Nah...

08:51.789 --> 08:53.746
Cake, cake!

08:54.872 --> 08:59.580
Hey Stine. Is Zaid home?
I've tried calling my brother.

08:59.706 --> 09:05.038
- It's probably on mute. Come on in.
- No, thanks. I just need a word.

09:05.164 --> 09:07.288
- Zaid.
- Yes?

09:10.581 --> 09:13.955
- Go back to our guests, okay?
- Sure.

09:14.081 --> 09:17.955
- Listen, Zaid...
- Hang on.

09:18.081 --> 09:20.371
- I've been calling.
- Are you okay?

09:20.497 --> 09:23.413
You don't answer your phone.
I'm in big trouble.

09:23.539 --> 09:29.288
I need your help. I'm fucked, man.
People are after me and shit.

09:29.414 --> 09:31.663
Listen to me for a second...

09:31.789 --> 09:34.163
- Zaid...
- Yasin, Yasin, shh.

09:34.289 --> 09:36.788
Listen, Yasin...

09:39.539 --> 09:42.871
We have company. It's Friday night.
We're celebrating...

09:42.997 --> 09:48.538
- I know you have guests, man.
- Not tonight, okay? Do you need money?

09:48.664 --> 09:51.205
- I can't explain..
- How much?

09:51.331 --> 09:55.413
I need 100,000, and then I promise
I'll be done with all this crap.

09:55.539 --> 09:59.205
Zaid, give me a chance.
I'm totally fucked.

09:59.331 --> 10:04.705
Just this one chance. Just one, and
I promise to never ask for money again.

10:04.831 --> 10:07.413
Yasin I can't give you 100,000.

10:07.539 --> 10:11.663
I swear on your son's grave this is
the last time I ask you for money...

10:14.081 --> 10:17.455
My son hasn't even been born yet,
do you hear me?

10:17.581 --> 10:21.038
Please give me a chance, Zaid.
Am I not your brother?

10:21.164 --> 10:25.205
- Am I not your brother?
- Come on. Push the button.

10:25.331 --> 10:28.913
You don't understand!
Everyone's after me!

10:29.039 --> 10:32.621
- Everyone?
- I'm fucked!

10:32.747 --> 10:37.121
- Zaid, just one last time!
- Push the button.

10:37.247 --> 10:40.246
I swear this is the last time, Zaid!

11:04.539 --> 11:08.871
Go back in, honey. I'll be right there.
Go on.

11:22.914 --> 11:28.163
- I can feel him breathing all day.
- It's kinda...

11:29.956 --> 11:31.955
It burns the throat.

11:32.081 --> 11:37.830
- Is everyone's glass full?
- Yup. Thanks.

11:37.956 --> 11:41.330
- There...
- Party time.

11:41.456 --> 11:44.955
- Cheers.
- We're so happy you could come.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.663
I'm so proud of you.

11:52.206 --> 11:53.913
I am.

11:55.164 --> 11:58.121
- Don't you believe me?
- Sure.

12:05.706 --> 12:11.163
- It won't even fit in my hand any more.
- No. Try with two hands.

12:42.831 --> 12:45.538
There was a little more...

13:10.206 --> 13:13.038
Zaid, may I have a word?

13:13.164 --> 13:16.330
- Now?
- Yes, now.

13:18.539 --> 13:22.371
Please count the napkins.

13:25.831 --> 13:27.621
Yes?

13:27.747 --> 13:33.455
I'm sorry, Zaid. Your brother has been
brought to the emergency room.

13:35.122 --> 13:38.621
- Why?
- He's severely injured.

14:34.664 --> 14:39.205
- Hey... don't go in there.
- Out of my way!

15:00.372 --> 15:04.955
It doesn't look good, Zaid.
There's nothing we can do.

15:07.331 --> 15:11.621
- Go. I'll tell them.
- Okay.

15:11.747 --> 15:14.621
Come here.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.080
Thank you.

15:26.789 --> 15:29.746
Nothing could be done.

15:33.622 --> 15:38.663
Yasin.
Yasin... no, no, no...!

16:40.497 --> 16:43.038
Do you need some more time?
I could...

16:43.164 --> 16:47.080
No, that's fine.
Let's get it over with.

17:12.414 --> 17:16.579
- Unite him!
- There is no god but God.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.579
- Unite him!
- There is no god but God.

17:24.705 --> 17:29.288
There is no god but God.

17:29.414 --> 17:33.371
Muhammad is the messenger of God.

17:34.206 --> 17:38.871
Paradise is a right.
Hell is a right.

17:38.997 --> 17:43.621
And the end of the world is a right.

17:43.747 --> 17:48.955
In honour of the deceased
we will say Al-Fatiha together.

17:50.789 --> 17:54.705
May God bless your presence.

18:08.289 --> 18:10.538
Torben...

18:16.581 --> 18:20.621
- My wife, Stine.
- Hi. Torben.

18:21.622 --> 18:24.413
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

18:24.539 --> 18:27.830
- What are you having?
- A boy.

18:27.956 --> 18:30.455
That's good.

18:31.497 --> 18:36.496
Stop by.
It would be nice to see you.

18:53.039 --> 18:56.538
I think you should go to your parents
for a couple of hours.

18:56.664 --> 19:01.455
I can't handle it. Not right now.
I'll do it tomorrow.

19:01.581 --> 19:07.996
I think it would be a good idea to go
hold your mom and talk with your dad.

19:08.122 --> 19:10.538
- Right?
- Yeah, okay.

19:10.664 --> 19:12.830
Good.

19:18.622 --> 19:22.371
- Shall I go talk...
- No, you're not going anywhere.

19:25.206 --> 19:30.871
Yeah! What do you think I want?
Take a wild guess.

19:41.747 --> 19:45.121
From our summer vacation.

19:51.164 --> 19:54.038
When he was a baby.

21:38.622 --> 21:40.913
Who are you?

21:41.039 --> 21:46.455
My condolences. I'm Alex.
I was Yasin's friend.

21:48.372 --> 21:50.663
His friend?

21:52.414 --> 21:54.371
What happened to him?

21:54.497 --> 21:59.038
If you know anything, you can tell me.
I'm talking to the police tomorrow.

22:02.331 --> 22:07.246
I thought as much. Have a good smoke.
Isn't that what you say?

22:07.372 --> 22:09.955
Hey, wait.

22:11.789 --> 22:16.288
I know he worked at the trap house
at Lunden for a guy called Branco.

22:16.414 --> 22:20.746
- What was he doing there?
- What do you think?

22:22.414 --> 22:26.746
Alex?
Zaid.

22:33.872 --> 22:37.996
- Zaid? Hi. Welcome.
- Thank you.

22:38.122 --> 22:43.205
Let me just say that what happened
was deeply tragic.

22:43.331 --> 22:47.413
It's never okay
when someone young dies.

22:47.539 --> 22:51.580
You must give yourself time
to process it.

22:51.706 --> 22:54.705
Have you talked to anyone?
A psychologist perhaps?

22:54.831 --> 22:59.038
No, I haven't but...

23:00.039 --> 23:03.371
I'm a doctor myself so...

23:03.497 --> 23:06.705
Thanks. Claus, I came here to find out -

23:06.831 --> 23:10.913
- how the investigation is going.
Any suspects?

23:11.039 --> 23:13.996
No, we're not quite there yet,
I'm afraid.

23:14.122 --> 23:19.788
Okay. I stopped by
my parents yesterday -

23:19.914 --> 23:27.621
- and 30-40 thugs
were hanging out around the mall.

23:27.747 --> 23:31.246
I had a feeling that they...

23:31.372 --> 23:35.205
Have you talked to any of them?

23:35.331 --> 23:39.246
No. We don't accuse people at random.

23:39.372 --> 23:43.788
We can't go around suspecting everyone
with dark skin and brown eyes.

23:43.914 --> 23:47.746
No, of course not, but that is
the area you're focusing on?

23:47.872 --> 23:49.913
We keep all options open.

23:50.039 --> 23:54.455
Claus, we have a tip on the other case
that we should move on now.

23:54.581 --> 23:58.621
- Would you excuse me a minute?
- Sure.

24:15.831 --> 24:19.955
- Apologies, Sadid.
- Zaid.

24:20.081 --> 24:24.621
Zaid, yes of course. There are
so many names to remember, so...

24:24.747 --> 24:30.788
But, Zaid, as soon as we hear anything,
you'll be the first to know.

24:31.956 --> 24:36.913
- Right.
- I hope I was of some help.

25:01.289 --> 25:06.205
Janni Svendsen is a 72-year-old woman
at out ambulatory in Herlev.

25:06.331 --> 25:09.288
She has a chronic dissection.

25:09.414 --> 25:15.330
In good condition. Elderly but with
functioning lungs and kidneys.

25:15.456 --> 25:19.496
Should we operate on her?
We don't know when it happened?

25:19.622 --> 25:22.080
She's at great risk of dying.

25:22.206 --> 25:27.163
Zaid, damn it, man.
I'm sorry to hear about your brother.

25:27.289 --> 25:30.080
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Are your paintings selling?

25:30.206 --> 25:32.621
Yeah, that one right there...

25:32.747 --> 25:35.621
Hey, babe.
What's up?

25:35.747 --> 25:38.413
Hi. Good to see you.

25:38.539 --> 25:43.330
I've sold three to a private showing.
Same guy. Jens Peter Brask.

25:43.456 --> 25:45.913
Biggest collector ever.

25:46.039 --> 25:49.246
Hey, guys!

25:49.372 --> 25:53.996
Hi, hello sweetie.
It's been forever.

25:54.122 --> 25:58.621
- You were passing out jelly shots.
- It's the last thing I remember.

25:58.747 --> 26:03.330
Anders and Zaid, I want you to meet...
Zaid, get over here.

26:03.456 --> 26:06.580
Ronnie. The King of Copenhagen.

26:08.581 --> 26:12.496
- And Shami.
- Hi.

26:12.622 --> 26:15.830
Will you excuse me?
I just need to...

26:15.956 --> 26:21.913
Get some for me. I just need one.
I'll mobile-pay you.

26:22.039 --> 26:25.288
- Sure.
- Thanks, sweetie.

26:33.456 --> 26:38.538
What the hell?
Keepin' warm in the car?

26:48.622 --> 26:54.455
...a few months maybe, but we don't
have a few months. We need more time.

26:59.997 --> 27:03.955
Take care, alright?
Thanks, guys.

27:05.372 --> 27:09.246
Hey, Zaid. It's freezing.
Aren't you coming inside?

27:10.622 --> 27:14.496
Aren't you coming inside?
Don't stay out here.

27:14.622 --> 27:17.121
It's not good for you.

27:18.914 --> 27:23.246
- Sorry! Sorry...
- Go join your guests.

27:26.081 --> 27:29.663
Hey...
Hey! What's going on?

27:30.914 --> 27:33.996
I'm just getting some fresh air.

27:34.122 --> 27:36.705
Hail a cab, okay?

28:29.789 --> 28:33.955
Is anything exciting going down
in the Middle East?

28:34.081 --> 28:39.996
Just because it doesn't matter to you
doesn't mean it doesn't matter to me.

28:40.122 --> 28:43.371
Did you talk to the police?

28:43.497 --> 28:45.955
What can the police do?

28:46.081 --> 28:48.871
What can the police do?

28:48.997 --> 28:53.371
What can the Danish police do?
We have to handle our own problems.

28:53.497 --> 28:58.788
Don't turn your back on me!
You should've looked after your brother!

28:58.914 --> 29:02.580
- Or have you forgotten who we are?
- Forgotten what?

29:02.706 --> 29:04.830
- So you did forget!
- Who are we?

29:04.956 --> 29:11.371
We're Iraqi! We're Iraqi, you bastard!
Have you forgotten, we're Iraqi?

29:14.622 --> 29:16.663
This is Iraq?

29:16.789 --> 29:21.955
Look! Is this Iraq?
Or that?

29:22.831 --> 29:26.330
Your brain is in Iraq
while your son becomes a street punk!

29:26.456 --> 29:30.996
You've been in Europe for 30 years!
In Denmark.

29:31.122 --> 29:34.621
On that damn couch!
We live here!

29:34.747 --> 29:39.246
You've been on that couch for 30 years!
Get up! Get off the couch!

29:39.372 --> 29:41.788
Get a job!
Get up, man!

29:41.914 --> 29:46.413
Can't you be at peace for once?
I can't handle it any longer.

29:46.539 --> 29:49.163
- It's all your fault!
- What do I have to do with it?

29:49.289 --> 29:53.871
- It's your fault!
- Is everything always my fault?

29:56.997 --> 30:01.455
Come.
Come here. I need you.

30:12.956 --> 30:17.621
- Where did you get that?
- I found it in your brother's room.

30:19.456 --> 30:25.163
- Why didn't you give it to the police?
- They'd go after your father.

30:25.289 --> 30:29.496
- Does he know?
- No, of course he doesn't know.

30:37.164 --> 30:41.121
What we know is that your brother
was involved in organized crime.

30:41.247 --> 30:46.413
Who killed him isn't something
you talk about in that environment.

30:46.539 --> 30:50.621
And they're not the kind of people
who talk to the police.

30:50.747 --> 30:55.330
So basically you have nothing.
Is that the problem?

30:55.456 --> 31:01.746
Well... We're in the midst of
a process that I cannot involve you in.

31:01.872 --> 31:05.538
But you do have
fingerprints, right?

31:05.664 --> 31:08.496
You have DNA evidence?

31:08.622 --> 31:12.663
You have a theory
that you're investigating?

31:12.789 --> 31:16.330
- I don't care for your tone.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

31:16.456 --> 31:19.663
And I'm sorry you lost your brother.
I really am.

31:19.789 --> 31:22.663
But he was part of a group
that aren't God's finest.

31:22.789 --> 31:27.246
- I hope you realize that.
- What does that mean?

31:27.372 --> 31:32.746
"Not God's finest...", so the murder of
this 20-year-old boy isn't a priority?

31:32.872 --> 31:36.246
He wasn't a boy.
He was a 20-year-old man!

31:36.372 --> 31:39.080
I'll show you.

31:39.206 --> 31:42.830
I wouldn't normally do this,
but you need to see it.

31:42.956 --> 31:47.496
When will you learn to control your
kids, so they don't all turn to crime?

31:47.622 --> 31:51.496
He was a 20-year-old man and criminal
to the bone. He couldn't follow the law.

31:51.622 --> 31:56.746
So the next time you want to tell me
how to do my work -

31:56.872 --> 32:00.955
- book an appointment
with my secretary! Understood!

33:07.706 --> 33:10.913
What are you doing here?

33:14.789 --> 33:17.413
Is this where your weed joint is?

33:19.164 --> 33:22.163
Branco, can I talk to him?

33:50.039 --> 33:53.205
We're almost ready.

33:56.789 --> 33:59.205
I'll call you back.

34:00.497 --> 34:02.538
Welcome.

34:03.331 --> 34:04.955
Sit down.

34:06.331 --> 34:10.038
- No, thanks.
- I'm telling you to sit down, man.

34:18.289 --> 34:23.330
I hear you're talking to people.
What do you want to talk about?

34:26.914 --> 34:30.163
- Yasin.
- Do you know any Yasin?

34:30.289 --> 34:33.121
- I don't know any Yasin.
- We don't know any Yasin.

34:33.246 --> 34:36.538
I know Yasin used to come here.

34:40.206 --> 34:43.121
- I'm Yasin's big brother.
- Get him a Coke.

34:43.246 --> 34:45.038
No, thanks.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.413
Drink.

34:56.289 --> 35:00.705
- My brother's dead...
- I'm telling you to drink.

35:11.664 --> 35:13.871
- You're Branco.
- Yeah.

35:13.997 --> 35:17.746
I know Yasin worked for you.
I don't care what you do...

35:17.872 --> 35:22.955
- We don't do shit.
- Right, Branco. My brother's dead.

35:23.081 --> 35:26.288
- Shut the fuck up.
- I just wanna know what happened.

35:43.164 --> 35:47.705
Look at me.
Look at me, man.

35:47.831 --> 35:52.205
This isn't a fucking social club.
Open your mouth, man.

35:52.331 --> 35:55.913
I don't know you or your brother.
I've told you many times.

35:56.039 --> 36:00.205
Don't show your face around here again.
Show some fucking respect.

36:00.331 --> 36:02.830
Get him out.

36:55.914 --> 37:01.080
Am I not your brother?
Everyone's after me! Believe me!

37:21.164 --> 37:23.413
Good morning.

37:24.706 --> 37:27.205
Good morning.

37:38.581 --> 37:43.496
Why are you in a T-shirt?
Were you at the hospital last night?

37:43.622 --> 37:45.913
Yes.

37:46.039 --> 37:50.746
- Please wake me when you leave.
- Yes, sorry. I was in a rush.

37:57.956 --> 38:02.580
- Would you like eggs or muesli?
- Yes, please.

38:31.456 --> 38:34.413
Shouldn't you take some time off?

38:36.206 --> 38:38.121
I can't, honey.

38:38.247 --> 38:43.705
I'm not talking about
a leave of absence, just a week or so.

38:43.831 --> 38:46.746
Stop it, please.
You know I can't.

38:46.872 --> 38:51.496
Zaid, you're not okay.
And look at you!

38:59.581 --> 39:04.080
I mean...
Zaid?

39:07.081 --> 39:11.955
I talked to some of Yasin's friends.
Or... people he worked with.

39:12.081 --> 39:16.288
Selling hashish or whatever.

39:17.414 --> 39:19.371
Okay, and...?

39:19.497 --> 39:24.413
They said fuck you.
Fuck your mother, fuck, fuck...

39:24.539 --> 39:28.163
- They don't say much.
- Did they do anything to you?

39:28.289 --> 39:35.330
No. I recognized them from when they
were kids running around the yard.

39:42.039 --> 39:46.330
I just know they're involved. And if
not, at the very least they know...

39:46.456 --> 39:51.080
The police handles
stuff like that, okay? Zaid...

39:52.539 --> 39:58.455
- Yes.
- Yes, it stops here.

40:09.122 --> 40:12.330
- No, it's not done.
- Surely you've written something.

40:12.456 --> 40:17.496
Yes, but once it's done,
it goes straight to the police.

40:17.622 --> 40:19.788
I'd like to read it.

40:19.914 --> 40:23.080
I know. But you should spare yourself
certain things.

40:23.206 --> 40:28.121
Anders, I'll get hold of it
no matter what. You know that, right?

41:02.831 --> 41:07.913
On your toes. Come one!
Go! Go! Go! Come one!

41:08.622 --> 41:13.705
Come here. Kick.
Okay, in place.

41:14.872 --> 41:16.871
Uppercut. Come on.

41:17.956 --> 41:20.788
Punch here. Punch here.

41:22.831 --> 41:26.413
Faster! That's great.
In place.

41:29.914 --> 41:31.955
Nikki. Let's go.

41:33.247 --> 41:35.580
Fast, come on.

41:39.122 --> 41:42.038
This is how it's done, people.

41:44.247 --> 41:47.121
That's right!
Good job.

41:53.081 --> 41:55.955
Come on, boys. Come on.
Block! Block! Block!

41:59.539 --> 42:01.913
Faster, faster, faster.

42:02.581 --> 42:08.246
I'm sick of this! I want the fucking
belt up on that wall. Yallah!

42:08.372 --> 42:12.996
What's up, brother? All good?
I have some tricks for the boys.

42:13.122 --> 42:18.413
I want the boys to win belts, you know?
Do they think this is just for fun?

42:18.539 --> 42:23.455
I'm all messed up.
I had those for Arab girls, I told you

42:23.581 --> 42:28.205
I took them up there. But they didn't
wanna do anything. All dried up.

42:28.331 --> 42:32.913
I bought four bottles of Grey Goose.
After three glasses -

42:33.039 --> 42:35.913
- They started dancing.
I got wasted, brother.

42:36.039 --> 42:39.621
But it was just an ape party.
You know?

42:39.747 --> 42:45.038
- My head's still fucking spinning, man.
- Fuck it, bro.

42:45.164 --> 42:49.080
- Are you on top of everything?
- He's ready. I'm just waiting.

42:49.206 --> 42:52.371
- The transport is in place.
- Perfect. Milking time, bro.

42:52.497 --> 42:55.371
- Lux, man.
- Harvest time, brother

42:55.497 --> 42:58.371
- Let's grab some dinner tonight.
- Sure.

42:58.497 --> 43:03.205
- Let's go blow off some steam.
- Yeah, it's been rough

43:05.706 --> 43:10.830
I just have some business with this one.
Sit down. Sit the fuck down.

43:10.956 --> 43:13.788
- Where were you?
- At Sunday with...

43:13.914 --> 43:17.330
- Why don't you answer you phone?
- It's turned off.

43:17.456 --> 43:21.371
- Maybe it's at Maria's
- 'Maybe'?

43:21.497 --> 43:25.455
- I'll go check.
- Listen to what I'm telling you.

43:25.581 --> 43:27.913
I don't want to mess up your face.

43:28.039 --> 43:31.121
But if you don't come back
with the phone and my money -

43:31.247 --> 43:35.871
- I'll fuck your face! Do you hear me?
Don't show your face anywhere!

43:35.997 --> 43:37.496
Fucking ape.

43:40.581 --> 43:42.455
Torben!

43:45.122 --> 43:47.788
What the hell?

43:48.872 --> 43:51.621
- I'll just wipe my...
- Bring it in.

43:57.706 --> 44:02.788
- Lars! Take a look at this.
- No way! Old warrior

44:03.872 --> 44:06.871
You still here?
Did you finally get married?

44:06.997 --> 44:10.371
It's damn good to see you, man.

44:12.956 --> 44:15.371
How's your mom doing?

44:17.456 --> 44:20.538
It is what it is, you know?

44:22.164 --> 44:26.871
And I guess you have nice long talks
with your dad.

44:30.581 --> 44:32.663
Yeah...

44:33.914 --> 44:36.455
This should look familiar.

44:42.831 --> 44:45.038
Nice, eh?

44:49.956 --> 44:54.205
- That can't be the same one.
- Sure, it's the same.

44:59.789 --> 45:02.788
- I want to start training again.
- Why?

45:02.914 --> 45:06.538
- The police won't do anything.
- Zaid.

45:06.664 --> 45:12.455
They can't or they won't.
But Yasin's killers are out there.

45:12.581 --> 45:15.038
- Zaid.
- That doesn't work for me.

45:15.164 --> 45:20.163
- You're losing it.
- I have to find out who did it.

45:20.289 --> 45:26.246
Those little gangster boys.
They're exploiting children.

45:26.372 --> 45:28.871
- Yes.
- They make them do their dirty work.

45:28.997 --> 45:32.038
Then they kick them out.
Or beat them to death like Yasin.

45:32.164 --> 45:36.705
And there's nothing you can do about it.

45:36.831 --> 45:40.663
You're a doctor, Zaid.

45:42.789 --> 45:44.871
You're a doctor.

45:44.997 --> 45:49.080
- The gangs aren't like in the old days.
- It's the same shit.

45:49.206 --> 45:56.162
Zaid, it's a different ball game now.
A knife ten years ago is an AK-47 today.

46:00.289 --> 46:03.580
They took Yasin from me.

46:04.872 --> 46:09.246
And that's okay?
Is that okay with you?

46:12.206 --> 46:15.621
Anyone can be a gangster, Torben.

46:16.831 --> 46:19.038
They're just pusher boys.

46:25.956 --> 46:27.871
Come on.
Again! Again.

46:28.872 --> 46:32.330
Come again. Focus!
Come on, God damn it!

46:35.039 --> 46:37.038
Wake the hell up!

46:37.164 --> 46:40.913
More. More! Come!
Come on!

46:52.914 --> 46:58.163
5, 6, 7, 8. Come on, Zaid. Here!
No, damn it!

47:00.372 --> 47:02.413
Hit it.

47:12.747 --> 47:17.996
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
That's right. Nice right hook!

47:32.956 --> 47:36.830
That's right!
Yeah! Great!

47:43.247 --> 47:45.371
Alex!

47:50.664 --> 47:52.496
What's up?

47:53.664 --> 47:58.205
- What are you doing here?
- I was just out for a run.

47:58.331 --> 48:00.246
You've started training?

48:00.372 --> 48:05.787
- I used to train. Then I stopped.
- Because of...

48:05.914 --> 48:09.829
No, I actually train better
when I'm high.

48:09.956 --> 48:14.537
I don't know, I just lost motivation.

48:14.664 --> 48:16.913
Then come with me.

48:17.039 --> 48:22.163
- I have plans.
- Come on. You already smoked, right?

48:22.289 --> 48:26.288
You can help me keep up the pace.
Come.

48:29.747 --> 48:33.413
4,5,6. That's it!
And now for the punch!

48:36.206 --> 48:39.121
Great!
Come again. Right hook.

48:40.206 --> 48:41.788
The hook.

48:41.914 --> 48:45.121
Yes! Right hook!
That's awesome! Time out!

48:45.247 --> 48:49.038
- Good work.
- Thanks.

48:52.164 --> 48:54.955
Good work.

48:59.914 --> 49:03.288
Hold the bag, would you,
so I can do one more round.

49:04.164 --> 49:06.580
Just let me finish smoking.

49:06.706 --> 49:09.663
Hold the bag, come on.

49:14.206 --> 49:16.871
Pull up my hood.

49:21.081 --> 49:25.830
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yeah. I'm seeing 3-4 ladies...

49:25.956 --> 49:28.496
3-4 ladies?

49:32.831 --> 49:37.330
I never got the hang of the girlfriend
thing. So I just see different girls.

49:37.456 --> 49:42.746
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- I have a wife. One's plenty.

49:42.872 --> 49:48.746
- You share a flat, a car, a dog?
- Flat, dog and Volvo.

49:48.872 --> 49:51.371
- Don't you want that?
- Nah.

49:51.497 --> 49:54.371
- Relax, man! Fuck that, man.
- Come on.

49:54.497 --> 49:57.163
Let me finish my joint.
Fuck this shit.

49:57.289 --> 50:01.996
- Why are you kicking like that?
- Come on. Hold it.

50:05.164 --> 50:07.871
Okay. Go.
I'm ready.

50:07.997 --> 50:13.371
Stand fast on your legs, so I can't push
you. Use your whole body. Ready?

50:13.497 --> 50:15.496
Yeah got it.

50:16.956 --> 50:20.955
- Wall.
- You can kick harder than that.

50:24.289 --> 50:26.621
I'm done.

50:28.622 --> 50:30.663
Hungry?

50:30.789 --> 50:33.705
- Sure, if you're buying.
- I'm buying.

50:34.581 --> 50:38.788
- I have 3-4 different ones.
- At the same time?

50:38.914 --> 50:43.038
No, not at the same time. Yet.
But I'd like to try that.

50:43.164 --> 50:46.496
And they come on different days.
Like, Monday it's Fie...

50:46.622 --> 50:50.830
...Tuesdays it's...
what's her name again?

50:50.956 --> 50:56.955
- What if you can't remember her name?
- It's on my phone.

50:57.081 --> 51:00.080
They come over and have a nice time.

51:00.206 --> 51:04.955
They clean and cook and...
Sweet girls.

51:06.247 --> 51:09.205
You live in there?

51:15.539 --> 51:19.455
Come.
The elevator is over here.

51:19.581 --> 51:24.705
Let's take the stairs.
I want to see all of it.

51:24.831 --> 51:30.413
- The stairs? I live at the top.
- So, we'll make a trip of it.

51:30.539 --> 51:34.413
I wanna see everything.
It looks insane.

51:44.747 --> 51:48.205
Can you open the roof
or is it shut permanently?

51:48.331 --> 51:52.495
- Nah, I don't think so.
- This is the last one, right?

51:52.622 --> 51:57.705
- You're the one who wanted to talk.
- Yeah, I know. It isn't hard.

51:57.831 --> 52:00.371
This is the last one.

52:03.122 --> 52:04.746
Wow.

52:07.206 --> 52:12.121
- Hi.
- Hi, honey. We have company.

52:12.247 --> 52:16.121
This is Alex.
Stine, my wife.

52:17.872 --> 52:20.621
- Alex.
- Stine. Hi.

52:20.747 --> 52:23.955
Where were you?
I've been calling.

52:24.081 --> 52:27.746
Check out of the view.

52:30.622 --> 52:34.788
- Who's he?
- A friend of Yasin.

52:36.914 --> 52:41.038
I saw him at the funeral and then
bumped into him a couple of times.

52:45.331 --> 52:47.330
Okay.

53:00.789 --> 53:05.038
Don't tell her
we were at Torben's garage.

53:05.164 --> 53:07.663
- A soda?
- Thanks.

53:07.789 --> 53:11.371
- You're welcome.
- You dip that in the water.

53:13.622 --> 53:19.413
- What's it made of?
- It's rice paper. It's made of rice.

53:24.872 --> 53:27.913
- You have a beautiful place here.
- Thank you.

53:29.539 --> 53:35.121
- Can you put salt on this?
- You can put anything you want.

53:35.247 --> 53:40.621
How about you?
Are you in school or working or...?

53:40.747 --> 53:43.538
- No, not really.
- Neither?

53:43.664 --> 53:46.413
No, I play computer games.

53:47.872 --> 53:50.121
PlayStation or...?

53:50.247 --> 53:54.038
No, stationary PC.
Computer, I mean.

53:55.622 --> 53:58.871
And what do you play?
Poker and stuff?

53:58.997 --> 54:02.955
No, it's a strategy game.
It's called the Battle for Middle-Earth.

54:03.081 --> 54:10.496
You construct a city online,
and then you attack your opponent.

54:10.622 --> 54:14.705
And you can get to different levels
and get stuff.

54:14.831 --> 54:19.830
Okay.
Have you finished it or won or...?

54:19.956 --> 54:23.746
You don't win.
It just continues indefinitely.

54:23.872 --> 54:26.913
You have an avatar
that you keep building on.

54:27.039 --> 54:30.330
My avatar, for instance, is an Orc.
From Uruk-hai.

54:30.456 --> 54:32.830
- An Unokai Orc?
- Uruk-hai.

54:32.956 --> 54:33.413
- Uruk-hai
- Orc.

54:33.456 --> 54:34.080
- Orc.
- Yes.

54:34.164 --> 54:34.580
- Orc.
- Yes.

54:34.914 --> 54:35.746
- Uruk-hai
- Orc.

54:35.872 --> 54:38.996
He's detached himself
from Saruman in Isengard.

54:39.122 --> 54:41.788
Oh, like in The Lord of the Rings?

54:41.914 --> 54:46.621
Exactly. But not a story you know.
It's called War in the North.

54:46.747 --> 54:50.663
It only exists in the game.
Not in the movie.

54:50.789 --> 54:54.080
- Or the books...
- Or the books.

54:54.206 --> 54:57.830
I spend a lot of time doing that.

54:59.289 --> 55:03.163
- No, thanks.
- Come on, have a taste. It's good.

55:03.289 --> 55:07.621
- It won't make me drunk, will it?
- Not at all. You can handle it.

55:09.289 --> 55:13.830
- That looks so professional.
- I've seen it in the movies.

55:13.956 --> 55:17.621
I've always wanted to try it.

55:24.747 --> 55:27.788
It's actually kinda tasty.

55:27.914 --> 55:31.288
Were you and Yasin close friends?

55:33.831 --> 55:39.663
We gamed and trained together.

55:45.747 --> 55:49.080
They boys are saying
Semion had something to do with it.

55:49.206 --> 55:53.496
He's Branco's boss, and he
controls Lunden. But I don't get it.

55:53.622 --> 55:56.996
Something must've gone wrong.

55:57.122 --> 56:00.371
Where can I find this Semion?

56:00.497 --> 56:03.830
He's hosting a fight in two days.

56:05.831 --> 56:10.246
- We're going.
- It'll be jammed with fucked-up guys.

56:11.539 --> 56:14.121
We can do this.

56:17.122 --> 56:18.663
I want to meet him.

56:25.622 --> 56:28.455
Right.
Again. Again.

56:28.789 --> 56:31.413
Yes! Yes! That's it! Come!

56:32.414 --> 56:33.871
Great!

56:33.997 --> 56:36.538
Yes! Low! Awesome!

56:37.747 --> 56:39.620
That's it!

56:39.789 --> 56:42.163
Great!
That's right!

56:52.831 --> 56:56.538
- Hey, what's up Hassan?
- Hey, long time no see.

56:56.664 --> 56:58.871
Good to see you.

56:58.997 --> 57:03.830
- How's it going? Are you okay?
- Sure, thanks.

57:03.956 --> 57:06.663
- See you in there.
- See you.

57:20.539 --> 57:25.121
Now!
Hassan, now! Get the hell out!

57:38.456 --> 57:40.413
Come on!

57:43.289 --> 57:46.288
We'll go over there.

57:47.414 --> 57:50.705
- Wassup, brother?
- What are you doing?

57:50.831 --> 57:52.955
Long time, brother.

57:53.081 --> 57:56.621
What've you been up to, man?
You smoke too much weed.

57:56.747 --> 58:02.746
Aren't you eating?
What the fuck is up with you, man?

58:02.872 --> 58:06.413
- What are you doing in my club?
- Looking for work.

58:09.914 --> 58:13.288
- It's a sick match.
- He looks insane.

58:13.414 --> 58:17.663
So, about the work thing.
What supermarket do you wanna work at?

58:18.747 --> 58:20.830
- Come to the weed joint.
- No.

58:20.956 --> 58:26.371
Relax! Go buy some clothes, bro.
Eat something.

58:28.956 --> 58:31.205
Hey, Hassan!

58:31.956 --> 58:34.080
Hassan!
Hassan!

58:38.456 --> 58:40.746
Kick him!

59:11.622 --> 59:15.288
Hassan! Hassan! Hassan!

59:15.414 --> 59:19.163
Hassan! Hassan! Hassan!

59:24.081 --> 59:25.955
This is his bottom.

59:26.081 --> 59:29.746
- There?
- Yes. Push a little harder.

59:29.872 --> 59:32.746
- Okay.
- We'll do like this.

59:32.872 --> 59:35.871
We schedule a new appointment
ten days from now -

59:35.997 --> 59:39.288
- and if he hasn't
turned around by then, we flip him.

59:39.414 --> 59:44.288
- How do you flip him?
- We sort of push...

59:44.414 --> 59:47.496
Hi.
I apologize.

59:49.539 --> 59:49.913
- Hi, Zaid.
- Hi, Lisa.

59:50.039 --> 59:54.246
- Uhm, Ulla.
- Ulla, of course. Sorry.

59:54.372 --> 01:00:00.121
I was just telling Stine
that he hasn't turned around yet.

01:00:00.247 --> 01:00:06.080
We should make it a new appointment in ten
days and see if he's done it by then.

01:00:06.206 --> 01:00:13.330
- What if you can't flip him?
- Then we should discuss a C-section.

01:00:13.456 --> 01:00:18.121
- He still may turn around on his own.
- Please let Ulla handle it.

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:21.788
Come back in ten days
so we can see if he's turned around.

01:00:21.914 --> 01:00:27.246
- Can I do something to help him?
- Nothing. Just enjoy your pregnancy.

01:00:30.622 --> 01:00:34.038
- I'm sorry, honey.
- I don't want to argue here.

01:00:35.622 --> 01:00:38.830
Come on, honey. I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

01:00:38.956 --> 01:00:41.829
- Sorry for what?
- That I was late.

01:00:41.956 --> 01:00:47.698
Nice. Listen. I'm trying to stay
positive and understanding...

01:00:47.831 --> 01:00:51.121
But I need you as well.
Being late like this isn't okay.

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:56.538
No, it's not okay.
It's just crazy-busy at work right now.

01:00:57.581 --> 01:01:01.535
- Why are you smiling like that?
- Because I shouldn't! You know me.

01:01:01.664 --> 01:01:05.704
Inside I'm full of remorse. I'm sorry.
Let's go out to dinner this weekend.

01:01:05.831 --> 01:01:09.663
Shall we do that?
A steak for my steak?

01:01:15.997 --> 01:01:21.538
That couldn't have hurt.
What kind of vest are you wearing?

01:01:21.664 --> 01:01:24.787
- I have to get back.
- Yeah.

01:01:25.622 --> 01:01:28.121
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:01:46.164 --> 01:01:49.913
Zaid, I managed to hack his phone.

01:02:09.956 --> 01:02:12.330
Zaid...

01:02:13.664 --> 01:02:15.705
Give me that.

01:02:19.081 --> 01:02:22.330
Go on, hand it over.

01:02:22.456 --> 01:02:25.913
Try this.
See if it fits.

01:02:45.706 --> 01:02:47.538
Breathe.

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:51.830
Nothing happened. This might happen
on the streets. Breathe.

01:02:51.956 --> 01:02:54.205
What if it had penetrated it!

01:02:54.331 --> 01:02:58.913
You have to be able to take a bullet
without whining. Get up.

01:03:01.039 --> 01:03:04.080
- Don't point it at me!
- You're losing it.

01:03:04.206 --> 01:03:05.455
Don't.

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:20.121
Hey! What the fuck's going on?

01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:31.830
What's going on?

01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:43.246
Where's Semion?

01:06:35.706 --> 01:06:40.371
We'll have it with green beans,
chilli fries and sauce béarnaise.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.663
Beans, chilli fries and béarnaise.
Excellent. And beverages?

01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:47.121
- Red whine?
- No, thank you.

01:06:47.247 --> 01:06:50.246
- One glass of red whine, please.
- Any preferences?

01:06:50.372 --> 01:06:52.746
What would you like?

01:06:52.872 --> 01:06:56.580
I'd say a Pinot Noir.

01:06:56.706 --> 01:07:02.163
Pinot Noir is an excellent choice.
Very nice. Thank you.

01:07:04.956 --> 01:07:09.955
- Maybe just a sip...
- No way. I offered you a glass.

01:07:10.081 --> 01:07:14.413
But I can't have a whole glass.
Just a little sip.

01:07:14.539 --> 01:07:17.871
You'll take a pregnant sip,
and there'll be nothing left.

01:07:17.997 --> 01:07:20.413
What do you mean?

01:07:25.914 --> 01:07:29.913
My boys!

01:07:33.247 --> 01:07:38.413
Have you been a good boy?
How's it going?

01:07:38.539 --> 01:07:41.205
You look happy.

01:07:41.331 --> 01:07:43.955
- Cheers, sweetie.
- Cheers, honey.

01:07:44.081 --> 01:07:46.288
Let's drink to a good week.

01:07:46.414 --> 01:07:50.371
Order whatever you like.
The money never runs out.

01:07:50.497 --> 01:07:54.163
This isn't a circus.
Do you think I need you to clap at me?

01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:57.288
- Two of the usual.
- Right away.

01:07:57.414 --> 01:08:00.830
Ice and mixed merchandise, okay?

01:08:03.164 --> 01:08:08.455
I was thinking...
after the baby's born -

01:08:08.581 --> 01:08:12.496
- maybe we could.. take a trip.

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:16.162
Take a trip?
Where did that come from?

01:08:16.288 --> 01:08:19.662
My wife. She suggested
I take some time off.

01:08:19.788 --> 01:08:25.996
- Sounds like a wise wife.
- Amazingly wise actually.

01:08:33.622 --> 01:08:37.080
We could go to Japan or...

01:08:37.206 --> 01:08:40.830
- Japan? Why Japan?
- I've never been.

01:08:40.956 --> 01:08:45.621
We'll be the couple
with the screaming baby on the plane.

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:49.787
- 300 big ones, my friend.
- May I see?

01:08:51.163 --> 01:08:53.787
- Good job, man.
- Wild.

01:08:53.913 --> 01:08:56.496
Or we could go to Berlin.

01:08:56.622 --> 01:09:02.330
We could drive there.
Or take a flight.

01:09:02.456 --> 01:09:05.955
We've had some good times in Berlin.

01:09:09.456 --> 01:09:15.705
Or Paris...
No, I miss our Berlin apartment.

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:23.371
We shouldn't have sold it.

01:09:25.331 --> 01:09:29.205
What do you think?
Do you miss Berlin?

01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:34.705
Hey...

01:09:39.372 --> 01:09:41.955
- Where are you going, honey?
- To pee.

01:09:42.081 --> 01:09:47.455
Maybe you'll want to be
part of the conversation when I return.

01:09:57.914 --> 01:10:00.121
Are you gettin' everything?

01:10:00.247 --> 01:10:03.413
Listen, you fucking fag.
Why are you staring at me?

01:10:03.539 --> 01:10:08.996
Can't you just eat your fucking steak,
fucking ape freak?

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:15.538
Why are you so high and mighty? Can't
you handle one of your own dining here?

01:10:18.164 --> 01:10:20.830
One of my own?

01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:28.705
They're actually not bad, these beans.
Let me tell you something.

01:10:28.831 --> 01:10:34.621
Spending fuckin' 1600 kroner here once
a month doesn't make you a big man.

01:10:34.747 --> 01:10:38.663
Who are you?
I come here all the time.

01:10:38.789 --> 01:10:42.621
That waiter is my personal slave.

01:10:42.747 --> 01:10:48.788
I make ends meet around here.
You forgot your roots.

01:10:49.789 --> 01:10:51.788
I remember you.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:55.955
I make sure that ends meet
in the place you're from.

01:10:56.081 --> 01:10:59.163
Those who are not my brothers,
I still treat like brothers.

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:01.955
Those who had no brother,
now have a brother.

01:11:02.081 --> 01:11:04.621
Those who had no door...
I gave them a door.

01:11:04.747 --> 01:11:07.871
Those who didn't have a light...
I gave them light.

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:10.788
I open a club for them.
I sponsor their soccer team.

01:11:10.914 --> 01:11:16.621
I make sure they can pay their rent.
What do you do?

01:11:16.747 --> 01:11:20.163
When did you last visit your mother?

01:11:22.622 --> 01:11:28.913
When did you last do something
for someone in the neighbourhood?

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:33.121
I don't give a shit about you
and your white world.

01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:38.871
At least I'm living in the place
I came from. I am where I come from.

01:11:40.831 --> 01:11:44.496
You couldn't even be there
for your own brother.

01:11:50.206 --> 01:11:54.621
Hi. Sorry I took your place.
We've never been introduced. Hi.

01:11:54.747 --> 01:11:57.788
- Hi.
- Semion.

01:11:57.914 --> 01:12:02.496
It's nice to see
you're starting a family. Nice.

01:12:03.831 --> 01:12:06.371
- How far along are you?
- Eight months.

01:12:06.497 --> 01:12:11.538
Congratulations. Fucking awesome job.
I'll send over some champagne.

01:12:11.664 --> 01:12:14.121
Congratulations.

01:12:15.414 --> 01:12:18.038
One of Yasin's friends?

01:12:19.122 --> 01:12:21.538
We're leaving.
Come.

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:28.330
I'll fuck you up, you little hoe!

01:16:40.289 --> 01:16:43.538
There he is.

01:16:43.664 --> 01:16:45.830
About time.

01:16:46.956 --> 01:16:50.913
- Is everything okay?
- Nice and easy.

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:53.913
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. You?

01:16:54.039 --> 01:16:59.038
- So why are you dragging us out here?
- Cool it, okay?

01:16:59.164 --> 01:17:02.621
Some fucking rat bastard
is trying to off me.

01:17:02.747 --> 01:17:06.496
- Who?
- That's what I'm trying to find out.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:11.038
That's why you're here.
Maybe you have some information -

01:17:11.164 --> 01:17:14.621
- or tell me if I've crossed you.
Tell me now.

01:17:14.747 --> 01:17:17.913
- But nothing happened.
- Only thanks to my car!

01:17:18.039 --> 01:17:20.955
- So why are we here?
- Am I hitting a nerve?

01:17:21.081 --> 01:17:25.580
You show up shit-faced and accuse us of
trying to off you. What's up with that?

01:17:25.706 --> 01:17:31.205
It's called precaution, brother. People
sneak up on me and try to waste me!

01:17:31.331 --> 01:17:35.330
If it doesn't hit a nerve,
don't worry about it.

01:17:35.456 --> 01:17:39.371
- But if you know something, say it.
- Are you saying it's one of us?

01:17:39.497 --> 01:17:43.121
- I'm just asking! What's up with you?
- Are you sick or something?

01:17:43.247 --> 01:17:46.080
If I was in fucking coffin,
I'd be sick!

01:17:46.206 --> 01:17:50.996
- Are you saying it's one of us?
- Are you totally mental?

01:17:51.122 --> 01:17:54.496
Why do you feel so threatened by this?

01:17:54.622 --> 01:17:58.413
Run! Everyone, run! Run! Run! Run!

01:18:05.539 --> 01:18:09.246
Where is that little rat?!
Find him!

01:18:09.372 --> 01:18:12.621
What the hell, man?

01:18:12.747 --> 01:18:16.121
Hello! Find that little hoe!

01:18:23.872 --> 01:18:29.038
You see what I'm dealing with?
Now ask me if I'm mental!

01:18:42.747 --> 01:18:44.330
- Hey.
- Hi Anton.

01:18:44.456 --> 01:18:49.663
We did an echo. It looks like
mitral insufficiency, so...

01:18:51.372 --> 01:18:54.580
Shall I call an anaesthesiologist?

01:18:59.831 --> 01:19:03.413
- Zaid?
- Yes, he needs surgery.

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:06.455
- Who'll be assisting? You?
- Yes, me.

01:19:06.581 --> 01:19:08.996
Lets get to it.

01:19:15.414 --> 01:19:18.080
Zaid.
Have you talked to the parents?

01:19:18.206 --> 01:19:21.663
- What?
- Have you talked to the parents?

01:19:30.664 --> 01:19:31.330
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:31.456 --> 01:19:31.913
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:34.414 --> 01:19:38.913
Your son has sustained a powerful blow
to his ribcage.

01:19:39.039 --> 01:19:42.163
It's pushing on
the right side of his heart.

01:19:42.289 --> 01:19:48.621
It's pushing on one of the valves.
So it's a complicated operation.

01:19:48.747 --> 01:19:51.621
Aren't you the son of Nidal?

01:19:52.997 --> 01:19:54.455
Yes.

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:57.496
We're grateful
that you'll be doing the surgery.

01:19:57.622 --> 01:20:01.413
Treat him like your brother.

01:20:03.706 --> 01:20:07.746
- I'll do everything in my power.
- Thank you.

01:20:09.872 --> 01:20:12.621
Initiate cardioplegia.

01:20:13.789 --> 01:20:19.496
Scissors, Ulla. Forceps sign.
Scissor sign. What does this mean?

01:20:19.622 --> 01:20:24.121
What's this? Scissor sign.
How long have you been here again?

01:20:41.664 --> 01:20:43.496
Hello?

01:20:44.747 --> 01:20:45.788
Hi, mom.

01:20:45.914 --> 01:20:46.246
Hi, mom.

01:20:51.122 --> 01:20:53.205
Okay.

01:20:55.581 --> 01:20:59.455
Okay, okay, I'll stop by.
Okay, Mom.

01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:18.830
- What's up, white man?
- What's going on?

01:21:18.956 --> 01:21:23.205
- What did you say?
- I said: What's up, white man?

01:21:24.872 --> 01:21:27.746
- Hey! Hey!
- Are you okay?

01:21:31.664 --> 01:21:33.371
Well?

01:21:33.497 --> 01:21:35.621
Well?!

01:21:44.539 --> 01:21:47.621
What were you gonna do with this?

01:21:47.747 --> 01:21:49.580
- Look at me.
- Zaid.

01:21:49.706 --> 01:21:52.371
Look at me.
Want to shoot me?

01:21:52.497 --> 01:21:56.913
Let him go, Zaid. Let him go.
Let him go.

01:22:02.122 --> 01:22:05.121
What are you doing?

01:22:05.247 --> 01:22:09.996
- They're..
- What? They're fucking little kids.

01:22:12.081 --> 01:22:16.246
- I have to go see my parents.
- No, you don't. They know who you are.

01:22:16.372 --> 01:22:20.830
- I have to go see my parents.
- You have to run! Now! Run, Zaid!

01:22:20.956 --> 01:22:24.455
Come on!
Come on!

01:22:38.539 --> 01:22:40.996
I can hear you.

01:22:43.081 --> 01:22:44.621
Hi, honey.

01:22:44.747 --> 01:22:48.955
Why are you sneaking in like that?

01:22:49.081 --> 01:22:54.330
- What?
- Why are you sneaking in like that?

01:22:55.497 --> 01:22:59.538
You were sleeping.
I didn't wanna wake you up.

01:23:02.747 --> 01:23:05.871
Do you take me for a fool?

01:23:05.997 --> 01:23:10.830
No, sweetie. I don't.

01:23:12.039 --> 01:23:14.580
- Zaid, what are you doing?
- Working.

01:23:14.706 --> 01:23:17.205
You haven't been at work.

01:23:19.914 --> 01:23:22.788
Where do you go at night?

01:23:26.956 --> 01:23:33.955
Yasin died, Stine. Do you understand?
They took my brother from me.

01:23:34.081 --> 01:23:37.955
Yes.
It wasn't your fault.

01:23:39.081 --> 01:23:43.663
What happened to Yasin isn't your fault.
You do understand that, right?

01:23:47.539 --> 01:23:53.038
Please tell me you're not involved
in all that stuff, Zaid.

01:23:53.164 --> 01:23:57.288
Please tell me you're not...
The police...

01:23:57.414 --> 01:24:02.663
Shut up about the police.
Don't talk about the police! Please?

01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:07.246
Zaid, we're having a baby.
I need you! I need you here!

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:15.746
Zaid, don't answer it.

01:24:17.206 --> 01:24:19.621
- Alex.
- Zaid!

01:24:19.747 --> 01:24:23.121
- Zaid! Don't...
- I can't hear you.

01:24:26.414 --> 01:24:28.830
Zaid...
Zaid, if you leave now...

01:24:28.956 --> 01:24:33.871
We'll do this later.
Alex. Hello?

01:24:52.122 --> 01:24:54.455
Alex.
Careful.

01:25:08.414 --> 01:25:10.705
Careful, Alex.

01:25:14.872 --> 01:25:18.580
You're talking to a doctor.
Never mind who.

01:25:18.706 --> 01:25:22.871
I have a severely injured patient.
His airways are secured.

01:25:22.997 --> 01:25:29.663
He's breathing on his own.
Skull fracture and multiple injuries.

01:25:29.789 --> 01:25:33.663
I need an emergency medical vehicle
and a primary ambulance.

01:25:33.789 --> 01:25:40.163
The address is Hennings Torv 8,
3rd floor, 2620 Albertslund.

01:25:40.289 --> 01:25:43.663
Understood?
Good.

01:25:46.622 --> 01:25:49.496
Who did this?

01:25:51.081 --> 01:25:54.496
- Semion.
- Semion.

01:25:55.956 --> 01:25:58.830
Alex, did you tell him about me?

01:25:58.956 --> 01:26:03.413
- I... can't remember.
- Okay.

01:27:13.372 --> 01:27:15.371
Hey.

01:27:17.122 --> 01:27:18.830
Hey! Hello!

01:27:18.956 --> 01:27:22.246
Police!
Hey!

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:27.580
Stop!
Police!

01:28:54.539 --> 01:28:58.163
- Hey. Do you have headlights for a 208?
- Sure, I do...

01:29:05.747 --> 01:29:08.080
Sit him up straight.

01:29:21.497 --> 01:29:24.246
Grab his phone.

01:30:18.289 --> 01:30:20.663
Fucking little rat, man.

01:32:36.372 --> 01:32:38.871
Hey. Psst!

01:32:38.997 --> 01:32:41.746
Look at this.

01:32:41.872 --> 01:32:44.580
Do you see this?

01:32:47.539 --> 01:32:49.913
Where is Semion?

01:32:50.039 --> 01:32:54.746
I don't know. Branco knows.
He's the only one who knows.

01:32:55.872 --> 01:32:58.288
I don't know. I swear.

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:17.371
What's up, Semion?

01:33:18.497 --> 01:33:22.038
We have something to celebrate.
We'll blow a month's pay.

01:33:22.164 --> 01:33:25.496
Not much.
I just had some food.

01:33:25.622 --> 01:33:28.413
- Say goodbye.
- I'll call you back.

01:33:28.539 --> 01:33:31.413
- What are you doing?
- Get in the car.

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:37.496
Calm down. Don't fucking play smart
with me. I'm getting in. Come.

01:33:38.789 --> 01:33:41.996
- Go.
- Where are we going?

01:33:42.122 --> 01:33:45.621
You have to tell me where we're going.

01:33:45.747 --> 01:33:48.705
- To Semion's place.
- Who the fuck is Semion?

01:33:48.831 --> 01:33:51.496
- Just go to Semion's.
- Tell me where.

01:33:51.622 --> 01:33:55.080
- To Semion's.
- I don't know any Semion.

01:33:56.581 --> 01:34:01.080
- Hello, relax, man.
- Any other questions?

01:34:01.206 --> 01:34:06.163
- Take me to Semion.
- We'll figure something out. Relax.

01:34:13.539 --> 01:34:16.205
You're a cold bastard, huh?
Nothing to come home to?

01:34:16.456 --> 01:34:20.455
- Don't you have a wife and children?
- Shut up. Shut up.

01:34:25.081 --> 01:34:30.288
I have two kids, brother.
And they expect to see me tonight.

01:34:30.414 --> 01:34:37.330
So calm down. You're a reasonable man.
We can talk about this.

01:34:37.456 --> 01:34:41.788
You may have two kids,
but that doesn't make you a dad.

01:34:41.914 --> 01:34:47.705
You're just a bum
who fucks up their life, so shut up.

01:34:47.831 --> 01:34:50.246
Go to Semion's place.

01:37:07.539 --> 01:37:11.163
"I forgot your address, brother."

01:39:15.997 --> 01:39:23.163
You come to my home, you rat?
Dirty little rat invading my home!

01:39:23.289 --> 01:39:30.163
Get up! Get up, I say!
You fucking rat!

01:39:33.122 --> 01:39:35.163
Get up!

01:39:50.414 --> 01:39:54.080
Is that all you've got?
Well?

01:40:00.956 --> 01:40:03.621
So? Want more?

01:40:06.206 --> 01:40:09.246
Is this all you've got?
Huh?

01:40:19.122 --> 01:40:22.996
Still not enough? I'll kill you
like I killed your brother!

01:40:23.122 --> 01:40:25.955
Do you really want me to kill you?

01:40:32.956 --> 01:40:35.038
Get up!

01:43:52.747 --> 01:43:57.746
Sorry!
I had nothing to do with it!

01:43:57.872 --> 01:44:02.121
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Sorry, sorry, sorry...

01:44:03.831 --> 01:44:06.080
Sorry! Sorry!

01:44:23.831 --> 01:44:26.330
Push down here.

01:44:28.372 --> 01:44:31.913
Push here. Push here...

01:44:44.456 --> 01:44:47.621
Can you hear me, Anton?

01:44:47.747 --> 01:44:51.538
I'm on my way to the hospital.
I have a boy with a gunshot wound.

01:44:51.664 --> 01:44:55.996
He's lost a lot of blood.
We'll be there in five minutes.

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:24.871
Zaid for God's sake,
what happened to you?

01:45:25.747 --> 01:45:27.455
Come here.

01:45:28.706 --> 01:45:32.746
- Grab on.
- A GSW to the abdomen.

01:45:32.872 --> 01:45:36.205
I stopped the bleeding.

01:45:36.331 --> 01:45:38.496
Zaid. Zaid...

01:45:38.622 --> 01:45:43.163
Zaid! Stine had the baby!

01:45:45.122 --> 01:45:47.746
She's here.

01:45:51.122 --> 01:45:57.746
Zaid... No! Don't go that way!
Go through the tunnel. Take my card.

01:45:57.872 --> 01:45:59.955
Zaid...

01:46:02.539 --> 01:46:04.871
Room 13, 5th floor!

01:46:38.581 --> 01:46:41.496
Hey! What are you doing here?

01:48:20.997 --> 01:48:26.663
Zaid, police! Hands to the sides.
Walk out slowly.

01:48:26.789 --> 01:48:30.205
Zaid! Arms out to the sides.

01:48:33.831 --> 01:48:36.455
Hands out at the sides.

01:48:38.914 --> 01:48:42.246
Lie down on your stomach.

01:48:48.497 --> 01:48:51.080
Palms up.

01:49:10.164 --> 01:49:14.163
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.

01:49:14.289 --> 01:49:16.580
Bring him in.
