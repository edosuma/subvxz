00:04.129 --> 00:05.387
Our work and our lives

00:05.389 --> 00:08.200
are based on certain
fundamental assumptions.

00:08.993 --> 00:11.286
Gravity holds us to the ground.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.289
Water is wet.

00:15.299 --> 00:19.568
No two human bite marks
are exactly the same.

00:24.709 --> 00:26.008
Derrick!

00:26.010 --> 00:27.609
Congratulations. Seriously, man.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.578
Congrats.

00:32.583 --> 00:34.850
We're all gonna be
working for you someday.

00:34.852 --> 00:37.219
All right, hold on.

00:37.221 --> 00:39.388
You're gonna need something
to wash this down with.

00:41.459 --> 00:43.525
What's this?

00:43.527 --> 00:44.960
Don't worry about it, man.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.425
Make you feel good,
mess you up a little bit.

00:46.427 --> 00:48.677
- Nah, nah, nah...
- No, dude, my dentist gave it to me.

00:48.679 --> 00:51.008
The worst it's gonna do
is make your teeth a bit whiter.

00:51.010 --> 00:53.068
Come on, we're all doing it.

00:59.571 --> 01:01.710
All right.

01:01.712 --> 01:03.579
My God.

01:05.786 --> 01:07.820
I just spotted my future wife.

01:07.822 --> 01:09.521
Go get her, man.

01:09.523 --> 01:11.990
Just walk up there, pretend
you want to order a drink.

01:11.992 --> 01:13.792
What do you have to lose?

01:13.794 --> 01:14.960
Come on, man.

01:14.962 --> 01:16.462
All right, all right, all right.

01:16.464 --> 01:18.063
Geez, get off me.

01:19.467 --> 01:20.599
Yes!

01:20.601 --> 01:21.834
All right.

01:21.836 --> 01:24.136
- Have a good night, man.
- You, too, my man.

01:24.138 --> 01:26.805
- We're free agents. Be good.
- Hey, thanks, man. Thank you.

01:26.807 --> 01:28.807
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hey, congratulations. Good luck.

01:28.809 --> 01:30.242
- Thank you, thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:30.244 --> 01:32.111
Take care. All right.

01:33.881 --> 01:37.483
Man.

01:37.485 --> 01:40.319
Wow. It's almost 2:00 in the morning.

01:40.321 --> 01:42.821
Need me to hail you a cab or something?

01:42.823 --> 01:44.656
I just live on the next block.

01:44.658 --> 01:45.958
Okay.

01:45.960 --> 01:48.293
Well, um, could I walk you?

01:48.295 --> 01:49.968
It's a free country.

01:52.054 --> 01:55.801
Listen, I like you, but...

01:55.803 --> 01:57.536
but I don't know you.

01:57.538 --> 02:00.639
So I think I should just go home, alone.

02:01.438 --> 02:03.408
Okay.

02:03.410 --> 02:06.645
Well, um, can I call you?

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.427 --> 02:23.028
You marked me.

02:23.030 --> 02:24.429
Does that mean I'm your property, now?

02:24.431 --> 02:26.665
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.334
Just give me a call.

03:00.872 --> 03:02.000
Good night.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.103
Good night.

03:07.942 --> 03:10.209
And congrats on your promotion.

03:10.211 --> 03:14.713
Thanks, Miss 2125550161.

03:20.454 --> 03:22.087
I know, right?
I can't believe it, either.

03:22.089 --> 03:24.590
I'm convinced I'm gonna get
a call from upstairs saying that

03:24.592 --> 03:27.025
- it was all just a big mistake.
- Way to go, man. Congrats.

03:27.027 --> 03:28.327
I've actually been demoted.

03:28.329 --> 03:31.230
You'll make it to where I am one day.

03:31.737 --> 03:34.333
Hey, Grayden,
let me call you back, all right?

03:34.990 --> 03:36.802
Good morning.

03:36.804 --> 03:38.303
Mr. Graham?

03:38.305 --> 03:41.173
I'm Detective Bradley,
this is Detective Rue, NYPD.

03:41.175 --> 03:44.243
Hi. Can I help you?

03:44.245 --> 03:48.313
Well, um, I was hoping
I could ask you a few questions,

03:48.754 --> 03:50.515
about Ashley Richardson.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.718
Ashley?

03:54.635 --> 03:57.189
Mr. Graham. Can I get you anything?

03:57.191 --> 03:58.423
No, thanks, I'm okay.

03:58.425 --> 04:01.126
I, I'd just love to get to it.

04:01.128 --> 04:02.461
Got a promotion yesterday.

04:02.463 --> 04:05.564
A new job, and today's
my first day, so,

04:05.566 --> 04:07.856
feels kind of weird
not being in the office.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.375
How's Ashley?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.070
Is she okay?

04:12.072 --> 04:15.340
II don't know her. II mean,
I... I just met her last night.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.975
She gave me her number, I...

04:16.976 --> 04:18.310
Is she okay?

04:18.312 --> 04:20.012
Well, for the record, Mr. Graham,

04:20.014 --> 04:21.313
we're being recorded.

04:21.315 --> 04:23.382
And I want to just make sure it's clear

04:23.384 --> 04:25.350
you're here of your own volition, right?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.286
You understand that you're
free to leave at any time.

04:27.288 --> 04:29.655
No, I get that.
And I want to help. I just...

04:29.657 --> 04:32.591
I kind of need to know what's going on.

04:33.548 --> 04:34.960
Okay.

04:36.931 --> 04:41.199
So, last night was the first time ever

04:41.201 --> 04:43.613
you saw Ashley Richardson, right?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.239
She's dead, Mr. Graham.

04:49.981 --> 04:52.077
Her body was found
in the park this morning.

04:52.079 --> 04:53.735
My God.

04:54.778 --> 04:56.882
She'd been beaten, raped,

04:56.884 --> 04:59.700
bitten on the neck, strangled to death.

05:01.159 --> 05:03.822
My God.

05:03.824 --> 05:06.091
Man, I...

05:06.093 --> 05:08.750
That's horrible, that's...

05:10.731 --> 05:13.332
Now, we have security video
that shows you and Ashley

05:13.334 --> 05:15.968
outside the bar after everyone else left.

05:15.970 --> 05:17.936
Nobody else is on the tape.

05:18.343 --> 05:20.272
You two were the only ones out there.

05:24.445 --> 05:26.578
So you were drunk and high.

05:26.580 --> 05:27.813
Yes, sir.

05:27.815 --> 05:31.116
And you wanted to have
sex with this girl. Right?

05:31.118 --> 05:33.919
I mean, I wanted to see her again,

05:33.921 --> 05:35.487
if that's what you're asking.

05:35.489 --> 05:37.389
I'm starting to think
maybe I should leave.

05:37.391 --> 05:38.690
I'm starting to think

05:38.692 --> 05:40.859
that I need to come back
with an attorney.

05:40.861 --> 05:43.729
Well, you're ccertainly free to do that.

05:43.731 --> 05:45.964
Look, you've been nothing
but cooperative. If...

05:45.966 --> 05:47.565
It's just, you know,
it's just thesethese questions.

05:47.567 --> 05:48.965
II just think that you might want

05:48.967 --> 05:50.819
to take a second and think
about how that would look.

05:50.821 --> 05:53.271
I mean, if you have nothing to hide.

05:53.273 --> 05:54.606
I don't.

05:54.608 --> 05:56.441
Again, totally up to you.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.244
But I do think you want
to give some consideration

05:59.246 --> 06:02.414
as to the appearance
that that would create.

06:07.621 --> 06:10.255
I've been here for what,
like, five hours?

06:10.257 --> 06:12.991
I haven't been keeping track of time.

06:12.993 --> 06:15.442
But yeah, we've been here a while.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.667
And like I said, I think you've
been nothing but cooperative.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.532
Do you think we're close to being done?

06:20.534 --> 06:21.733
I do.

06:21.735 --> 06:24.169
You got to tell me the truth,
Derrick. You're in it, kid.

06:24.171 --> 06:26.738
All that booze and the drugs.

06:26.740 --> 06:29.007
I mean, your memory's pretty spotty.

06:29.009 --> 06:31.343
You ever blacked out before, Derrick?

06:31.833 --> 06:33.345
II don't know. I've...

06:33.347 --> 06:35.680
- II don't think so.
- Come on.

06:35.682 --> 06:38.183
Maybe once, in college. Maybe twice.

06:38.185 --> 06:40.018
So it's possible.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.553
You could've blacked out. I don't know.

06:41.555 --> 06:43.555
I feel like I remember
everything that happened.

06:43.557 --> 06:46.725
Okay, here's the thing, Derrick.

06:46.727 --> 06:49.027
Ashley lived for a couple of hours

06:49.029 --> 06:50.862
after she was found in the park.

06:50.864 --> 06:52.330
I spoke to her.

06:52.332 --> 06:55.700
And she identified you as her attacker.

06:58.193 --> 06:59.905
Ashley said I did it?

07:00.445 --> 07:02.707
Have no reason to lie, would she?

07:02.709 --> 07:04.342
No, but, I mean...

07:04.344 --> 07:06.011
She was intubated,
so she couldn't actually speak.

07:06.013 --> 07:07.312
But I asked her to write down

07:07.314 --> 07:09.381
the name of the guy who did this to her.

07:09.383 --> 07:10.882
You want to see what she wrote?

07:10.884 --> 07:13.552
Yeah, sure, of course.

07:18.292 --> 07:21.493
This is Ashley's handwriting.

07:22.896 --> 07:25.397
I mean, I don't know, Derrick.

07:25.399 --> 07:27.532
Maybe you hurt her without meaning to.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.901
I'm just saying
it could've been an accident.

07:31.672 --> 07:34.039
Here's the proof.

07:36.877 --> 07:38.810
It's okay.

07:38.812 --> 07:40.812
Then, one night, you can't sleep.

07:40.814 --> 07:43.081
You start digging through
professional journals

07:43.083 --> 07:44.983
you've been meaning to read, and...

07:44.985 --> 07:47.152
and there it is.

07:47.154 --> 07:49.087
Courts all over the country

07:49.089 --> 07:52.224
are starting to reject
bite mark evidence.

07:53.627 --> 07:55.227
The legal community,

07:55.229 --> 07:58.169
courts, lawyers, law enforcement,

07:58.832 --> 08:02.100
a lot of them no longer believe
there's anything to it.

08:02.102 --> 08:04.469
And that matters because...?

08:04.471 --> 08:05.971
Derrick Graham.

08:09.243 --> 08:11.143
When I went into
the trial science business,

08:11.145 --> 08:13.812
one of the first trials
I was involved with

08:15.053 --> 08:16.314
was a murder trial.

08:16.316 --> 08:19.417
A, young investment banker
was accused

08:19.419 --> 08:23.255
of raping and killing a young
woman one night in a park.

08:23.257 --> 08:25.323
Downtown Manhattan.

08:25.325 --> 08:27.157
The Wall Street Slayer.

08:27.628 --> 08:30.495
Well, obviously you did
your job; Guy's in prison.

08:30.497 --> 08:31.863
No.

08:32.871 --> 08:34.456
I lost.

08:35.169 --> 08:37.034
I was working for the defense.

08:37.037 --> 08:38.270
And I believed with all my heart

08:38.272 --> 08:39.804
that he was innocent; I still do.

08:39.806 --> 08:41.573
Where are we going with this?

08:41.575 --> 08:44.176
The D.A. had three key pieces
of evidence.

08:44.178 --> 08:46.545
First, DNA evidence.

08:46.547 --> 08:48.580
My client's DNA was found on the victim.

08:48.582 --> 08:50.882
And he admitted that was because
he was kissing her

08:50.884 --> 08:52.484
earlier in the evening.

08:52.486 --> 08:55.120
Wait a second. I remember this case.

08:55.122 --> 08:56.821
Didn't he confess?

08:56.823 --> 08:59.925
A coerced confession, yes.

08:59.927 --> 09:01.393
A false confession.

09:01.395 --> 09:03.195
And that's piece number two.

09:03.197 --> 09:04.930
The detectives lied to the suspect,

09:04.932 --> 09:06.898
something they're allowed to do
in New York state,

09:06.900 --> 09:09.734
and I think we did a pretty good
job of making that clear

09:09.736 --> 09:11.242
to the jury.

09:11.772 --> 09:14.439
But then there was bite mark evidence.

09:14.441 --> 09:16.841
Which is now starting
to be considered bogus.

09:16.843 --> 09:18.043
Wait.

09:18.045 --> 09:19.778
Okay, you got me on two out of three.

09:19.780 --> 09:23.848
But an Ivyeducated investment
banker confessed to a murder

09:23.850 --> 09:25.350
he did not commit?

09:25.352 --> 09:26.716
They lied to him.

09:27.087 --> 09:29.988
They told him
the victim had identified him

09:29.990 --> 09:31.890
just before she succumbed
in the hospital.

09:31.892 --> 09:34.359
My client was in shock; He was upset

09:34.361 --> 09:36.194
and confused.

09:36.196 --> 09:39.864
I'm telling you, this man is innocent.

09:54.848 --> 09:56.348
Dr. Bull.

09:56.350 --> 09:57.749
Been a while.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.419
You think so?

10:04.424 --> 10:07.826
This is gonna sound hollow,
but I have wanted to visit.

10:08.258 --> 10:09.494
I know.

10:10.301 --> 10:12.230
I got your messages from way back when.

10:12.232 --> 10:16.167
I just... couldn't.

10:16.169 --> 10:19.304
You, my friends, my parents,

10:19.306 --> 10:21.062
even my sister.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.733
Haven't seen a one of them.

10:25.984 --> 10:28.403
I just kept saying no,
and they stopped asking.

10:29.487 --> 10:31.349
Well, thank you for saying yes
this one time,

10:31.351 --> 10:33.451
and let me tell you why I'm here.

10:33.453 --> 10:35.053
Bite mark evidence is no longer

10:35.055 --> 10:37.222
anyone's gold standard for anything.

10:37.224 --> 10:41.026
More and more courts
are refusing to recognize it.

10:45.766 --> 10:48.767
I'd like to file a motion
to vacate the guilty verdict.

10:48.769 --> 10:50.969
See if we can't get you a new trial.

10:50.971 --> 10:53.104
I'd like to fix this
for you, Derrick. I'd...

10:53.106 --> 10:56.808
I'd like to get you your life back.

10:56.810 --> 10:58.877
Can I have your permission?

10:58.879 --> 11:02.747
Sure. What do I care?

11:04.451 --> 11:06.274
Here's the thing.

11:08.155 --> 11:12.023
All of this, you...

11:12.025 --> 11:14.282
everything that happened
after that night...

11:15.395 --> 11:17.535
it's all just a dream, man.

11:18.518 --> 11:20.218
And I'm really just asleep.

11:22.069 --> 11:24.736
Either that or I'm dead,
and this is death.

11:27.941 --> 11:29.506
Either way...

11:31.011 --> 11:33.445
whatever you do is fine.

Hey, Anna. It's Uncle Chunk.

11:57.492 --> 11:58.916
Your dad.

12:01.826 --> 12:03.860
This is, like, the sixth time
that I've called.

12:03.862 --> 12:06.562
And your mom sent me an email,
so I know you're coming

12:06.564 --> 12:08.920
in two weeks so we can go tour NYU.

12:09.701 --> 12:13.569
It's just feeling a little
strange on my end that...

12:13.571 --> 12:15.938
we haven't actually had a conversation

12:15.940 --> 12:18.138
since Thanksgiving.

12:19.377 --> 12:22.559
That you don't or won't
return my phone calls,

12:22.947 --> 12:25.061
not even at Christmas.

12:26.484 --> 12:31.354
So, please, just, I'm asking,
just call me back.

12:31.356 --> 12:34.390
Doesn't matter what time of day;
My phone's always on.

12:34.392 --> 12:37.693
Just... please.

14:23.735 --> 14:25.234
Hello, Anna?

14:25.236 --> 14:26.636
Congratulations.

14:26.638 --> 14:29.472
You've just won a Florida cruise!

14:30.808 --> 14:34.744
Man, nine years is a long time.

14:34.746 --> 14:36.779
Some of this stuff's pretty funky.

14:36.781 --> 14:39.582
Tell me about it.
What do you think this is?

14:42.286 --> 14:44.220
Well, those holes are
where the police lab

14:44.222 --> 14:45.988
cut out pieces for testing.

14:45.990 --> 14:48.124
The only DNA that they
recovered was Ashley's.

14:48.126 --> 14:49.546
Well, it's been nine years.

14:49.548 --> 14:51.994
Technology has improved since then.

14:51.996 --> 14:54.530
Might be worth giving it another go.

14:54.532 --> 14:56.799
Yes, of course I remember Derrick.

14:56.801 --> 14:58.801
He, showed a lot of promise.

14:58.803 --> 15:00.703
He was on the partnership track.

15:00.705 --> 15:04.607
Do you remember his coworker,
Matt Williams?

15:05.843 --> 15:07.476
Sure.

15:07.478 --> 15:10.146
Matt got indicted a few years back.

15:10.148 --> 15:11.380
Insider trading.

15:12.270 --> 15:14.316
What about Josh O'Connor?

15:14.318 --> 15:17.119
Finally. Easy question.

15:17.121 --> 15:18.754
He's about six floors up.

15:18.756 --> 15:21.490
Got a big grin and a big bank account.

15:22.155 --> 15:25.094
Wow. I certainly didn't see this coming

15:25.096 --> 15:26.862
when I woke up this morning.

15:26.864 --> 15:28.330
So, what would I have to do?

15:28.332 --> 15:29.753
Well, there's no doubt in my mind

15:29.755 --> 15:31.409
the prosecution's
gonna want to subpoena you.

15:31.411 --> 15:33.910
They're gonna want you to set the scene.

15:33.912 --> 15:37.473
Place Derrick and Ashley
together at the bar,

15:37.475 --> 15:39.475
talk about the drinking, the hydrocodone.

15:40.548 --> 15:43.012
Not my finest hour.

15:43.014 --> 15:45.314
Well, then, when we crossexamine,

15:45.316 --> 15:48.117
I'm gonna want you to paint
a fuller picture of your friend.

15:48.118 --> 15:51.553
His demeanor, his character.

15:52.060 --> 15:54.289
I have yet to meet anyone
who knew this man

15:54.291 --> 15:57.325
who believed he was capable
of this kind of savagery.

15:57.327 --> 15:59.027
It's true, it's true.

15:59.029 --> 16:00.662
Derrick was always a perfect gentleman.

16:00.664 --> 16:02.931
He was the kind of guy
that would ask permission

16:02.933 --> 16:05.228
before he'd kiss a girl.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.801
So, I can count on you?

16:06.803 --> 16:09.304
Maybe come into my office
for a couple of hours,

16:09.306 --> 16:11.139
do a little witness prep?

16:11.141 --> 16:12.707
Of course.

16:12.709 --> 16:14.976
But what's gonna be different
about this trial?

16:14.978 --> 16:16.912
They got a new suspect or something?

16:16.914 --> 16:18.914
No, but bite mark evidence

16:18.916 --> 16:21.182
is starting to be recognized
for the junk science

16:21.184 --> 16:23.418
it's always been, and I'm hoping

16:23.420 --> 16:25.720
that gives us a shot at a second trial.

16:25.722 --> 16:27.122
Same judge?

16:27.124 --> 16:29.591
Same prosecutor, same everybody.

16:29.593 --> 16:31.643
Except for the jury.

16:33.930 --> 16:35.530
Kind of big, don't you think?

16:35.532 --> 16:38.033
It's intentional;
Trying to make you look smaller.

16:38.035 --> 16:40.035
You mean less threatening.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.340
Been a while since I needed one of these.

16:46.155 --> 16:48.990
Can't even imagine what it's like

16:48.992 --> 16:50.512
to wake up every day and realize

16:50.514 --> 16:53.048
that you're in prison
for something you did not do.

16:53.803 --> 16:56.624
It's actually kind of reassuring
to hear you say that.

16:57.020 --> 16:58.853
There are days I forget.

16:58.855 --> 17:02.190
Days I convince myself
prison is where I belong.

17:02.192 --> 17:03.725
Has to be.

17:04.173 --> 17:05.794
Otherwise...

17:06.425 --> 17:08.229
why am I there?

17:08.231 --> 17:10.432
What about a support system?

17:10.434 --> 17:11.900
Friends? Family?

17:11.902 --> 17:13.068
Not really.

17:13.598 --> 17:15.069
Well, there must be someone.

17:15.071 --> 17:16.538
Didn't I hear you have a sister?

17:16.540 --> 17:18.205
When's the last time you spoke to her?

17:18.208 --> 17:20.275
I haven't seen or spoken
to anyone from before

17:20.277 --> 17:21.566
since they locked me up.

17:22.613 --> 17:24.068
Just better for me.

17:24.647 --> 17:26.112
Better for everyone.

17:26.650 --> 17:29.484
Does your family know what's going on?

17:29.486 --> 17:31.886
That we're trying to get you a new trial?

17:31.888 --> 17:34.923
It's always good to have
your people in the audience.

17:34.925 --> 17:37.325
The judge and the jury will notice.

17:38.929 --> 17:40.918
I don't know what to tell you.

17:43.900 --> 17:46.035
All right, I'lll'll make some calls.

17:46.037 --> 17:49.504
A.D.A. Madden's own expert, Dr. Novak,

17:49.506 --> 17:51.773
has withdrawn her initial opinion

17:51.775 --> 17:54.409
about the validity
of the bite mark impressions.

17:54.411 --> 17:56.745
By her own admission, she now claims

17:56.747 --> 17:58.847
that the jury should
have never considered

17:58.849 --> 18:01.249
her testimony as evidence
of my client's guilt.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.318
Your Honor, even if
you accept that as true,

18:03.320 --> 18:04.919
there was a mountain of other evidence.

18:04.921 --> 18:06.121
There was DNA...

18:06.123 --> 18:07.188
Of course there was.

18:07.190 --> 18:09.391
My client freely admitted that he engaged

18:09.393 --> 18:11.459
in consensual contact
with Miss Richardson.

18:11.461 --> 18:13.128
Your client also confessed
to killing her.

18:13.130 --> 18:14.763
My client was coerced.

18:15.411 --> 18:17.766
Which is why we're moving
to suppress the confession.

18:17.768 --> 18:19.601
- On what grounds?
- A valid confession

18:19.603 --> 18:22.170
must be knowing, willing and voluntary.

18:22.172 --> 18:25.340
I submit that the detectives'
lies made that impossible.

18:25.342 --> 18:27.108
Okay, I've heard enough.

18:27.548 --> 18:29.310
I know the case very well.

18:29.312 --> 18:31.012
I presided at the original trial,

18:31.014 --> 18:33.715
and I considered a motion
to suppress then and denied it,

18:33.717 --> 18:34.983
and I'm denying it now.

18:37.238 --> 18:39.988
But I'm going to grant your
motion to vacate the conviction.

18:39.990 --> 18:43.324
I'm granting a new trial.
We're adjourned.

18:43.326 --> 18:46.828
Talk about snatching victory
from the arms of defeat.

18:46.830 --> 18:49.831
I wouldn't crack open
any champagne just yet.

18:49.833 --> 18:51.666
I have something for you.

18:52.281 --> 18:53.601
“Notice of Discovery.”

18:53.603 --> 18:55.437
Yes, indeed. We have a new witness.

18:55.952 --> 18:57.872
Who's Jerome Sheffield?

18:57.874 --> 18:59.641
He's my cell mate.

18:59.643 --> 19:00.809
Former cell mate.

19:00.811 --> 19:02.744
We moved him to another facility
this morning.

19:02.746 --> 19:04.612
Crime happened nine years ago.

19:04.614 --> 19:06.514
What's he going to say?

19:06.516 --> 19:09.484
Let me guess, he's gonna say
our client confessed to him.

19:09.486 --> 19:10.819
Confessed to him about what?

19:10.821 --> 19:13.188
Mr. Graham, I'm advising you
not to speak.

19:13.190 --> 19:15.290
Jerome Sheffield is prepared to testify

19:15.292 --> 19:16.858
that your client admitted to him

19:16.860 --> 19:18.827
that he raped and murdered
Ashley Richardson.

19:18.829 --> 19:20.595
He's lying. That never happened.

19:20.597 --> 19:22.464
Stop talking; He is trying to bait you.

19:22.466 --> 19:25.033
When did my client make
this socalled confession?

19:25.035 --> 19:26.000
Two days ago.

19:26.002 --> 19:27.602
How serendipitous. So, I'm guessing

19:27.604 --> 19:29.971
the day we filed a motion
for a new trial,

19:29.973 --> 19:33.174
you offered Derrick's cell mate
a deal for what, exactly?

19:33.176 --> 19:36.411
Early release? And then, miraculously,

19:36.413 --> 19:38.613
he came to you with a confession.

19:38.615 --> 19:41.416
And people say there is no God.

19:41.418 --> 19:43.718
You might want to dial it down, Dr. Bull.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.127
Do you have this confession on tape?

19:46.957 --> 19:48.022
Yeah, I didn't think so.

19:48.024 --> 19:49.257
A confession is a confession.

19:49.259 --> 19:52.494
Or, in this case, two confessions.

19:52.496 --> 19:54.629
I proved this man was guilty once.

19:54.631 --> 19:56.564
I'm happy to do it again.

19:58.802 --> 20:02.570
Gee, for a fleeting moment
there, that felt really good.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.911
It's a new day!

20:22.913 --> 20:25.141
A new chance to convince oneself

20:25.142 --> 20:27.309
that the cause is not lost.

20:27.311 --> 20:29.344
Maybe it's just temporarily misplaced.

20:29.346 --> 20:32.147
You slept here again?

20:32.149 --> 20:34.116
Well... Ooh, sorry.

20:34.118 --> 20:35.784
Yeah. I was reading the transcripts

20:35.786 --> 20:37.619
from the original trial, and I looked up

20:37.621 --> 20:39.154
and it was 5:00 a.m.

20:39.156 --> 20:40.689
Grabbed a couple hours on the couch.

20:40.691 --> 20:43.091
- You don't have a clean shirt, do you?
- Yeah.

20:43.093 --> 20:45.494
Hey. Sorry to barge in.

20:45.496 --> 20:48.263
And, to what do I owe the pleasure?

20:48.265 --> 20:49.698
Well, I ordered some new

20:49.700 --> 20:51.600
stateoftheart DNA tests on the scarf.

20:51.602 --> 20:54.169
- Ashley was wearing that night.
- And?

20:54.171 --> 20:56.738
And they found something new, DNAwise,

20:56.740 --> 20:59.174
that doesn't belong to Ashley or Derrick.

20:59.176 --> 21:00.487
Well, we like the sound of that.

21:00.489 --> 21:02.778
Yeah, well, might belong
to the store clerk

21:02.780 --> 21:04.279
that sold it to her or someone

21:04.281 --> 21:05.948
she brushed up against in the bar.

21:05.950 --> 21:07.115
Or the killer.

21:07.117 --> 21:08.350
Or the killer.

21:08.352 --> 21:10.319
But that we don't know,
because whoever it is

21:10.321 --> 21:11.520
isn't showing up in the system.

21:11.522 --> 21:14.189
Which leads me to my next question.

21:14.191 --> 21:16.291
Where are we with alternate suspects?

21:16.293 --> 21:18.593
Other people who were
in the bar that night,

21:18.595 --> 21:21.163
people in the neighborhood
with prior sex crime records?

21:21.165 --> 21:22.597
Well, with all due respect,

21:22.599 --> 21:25.701
Dr. Bull, we're still shortstaffed,

21:25.703 --> 21:28.337
and that used to be
something Cable would do

21:28.339 --> 21:30.539
for us online, and, as you know, um,

21:30.541 --> 21:32.407
at the moment, there's no Cable.

21:32.409 --> 21:33.976
Be that as it may,

21:33.978 --> 21:36.411
we always managed to get things
done before there was a Cable,

21:36.413 --> 21:38.199
and I have every confidence
you'll get it done

21:38.201 --> 21:39.546
until we find her replacement.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.684
I hate to be a Debbie Downer,
but last night I pored over

21:42.686 --> 21:44.319
the police records, witness statements,

21:44.321 --> 21:47.255
and I didn't find any new leads.

21:47.257 --> 21:48.390
Not a one.

21:48.392 --> 21:49.992
It supports our narrative.

21:49.994 --> 21:53.595
The reports don't make any
reference of alternate suspects

21:53.597 --> 21:55.797
because the detectives
never looked for any.

21:55.799 --> 21:57.933
It's called myside bias.

21:57.935 --> 22:00.902
The police have always believed
that Derrick was the killer.

22:00.904 --> 22:04.339
Their entire investigation was centered

22:04.341 --> 22:06.541
on proving that to be true.

22:06.543 --> 22:09.411
What should've happened was
an open and fair investigation.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.947
But in this case,
all they did was find evidence

22:11.949 --> 22:13.949
to support a predetermined conclusion.

22:13.951 --> 22:15.175
Aren't you a chipperlooking pair?

22:15.177 --> 22:16.302
Glum and glummer?

22:16.304 --> 22:19.454
Well, hard to put on a happy
face when you look at this data.

22:19.456 --> 22:21.590
Been doing some polling,
Bull, and it suggests

22:21.592 --> 22:24.011
that over 80% of our potential jury pool

22:24.013 --> 22:25.790
still remember Derrick's first trial

22:25.792 --> 22:27.554
and already believe he's guilty.

22:27.556 --> 22:28.760
Those are some tough odds.

22:28.762 --> 22:30.465
And now with this new confession...

22:30.467 --> 22:32.300
Yeah. I hear you.

22:32.302 --> 22:34.263
I guess we just have to find a jury

22:34.265 --> 22:37.013
who can see through these
socalled confessions.

22:37.015 --> 22:39.107
Okay. If you say so.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.043
And where would one look for said jury?

22:41.045 --> 22:42.825
How well do you know Shakespeare?

22:42.827 --> 22:46.381
I, read Romeo and Juliet
in high school.

22:46.383 --> 22:48.784
I think. Or maybe I saw the movie.

22:48.786 --> 22:51.887
What I need are jurors who identify.

22:51.889 --> 22:55.657
Jealousy.

22:55.659 --> 22:58.226
Or more specifically,
the absolute certainty

22:58.228 --> 23:00.395
that makes jealousy possible.

23:00.397 --> 23:03.665
You see, Othello suspected his
wife of having an affair,

23:03.667 --> 23:05.000
so he confronted her.

23:05.002 --> 23:07.235
And quite understandably,
she vigorously denied it.

23:07.237 --> 23:09.486
She cried and did everything
she could to convince him,

23:09.488 --> 23:11.994
but Othello didn't care.

23:11.996 --> 23:15.343
He was absolutely certain of her guilt.

23:15.345 --> 23:16.990
In fact, he believed Desdemona's tears

23:16.992 --> 23:19.281
were proof of her consciousness of guilt.

23:19.283 --> 23:22.417
The irony is all they were was a reaction

23:22.419 --> 23:24.310
to her husband's not believing her.

23:24.312 --> 23:26.555
Long story short, Othello killed his wife

23:26.557 --> 23:28.156
for something she didn't do.

23:28.158 --> 23:29.968
Now, I want jurors who understand

23:29.969 --> 23:31.569
that just because Detective
Bradley, for that matter,

23:31.571 --> 23:33.090
the entire police department,

23:33.092 --> 23:34.620
believes something

23:34.656 --> 23:39.310
with all their might,
it doesn't make it true.

23:39.312 --> 23:42.580
If you were questioning someone
from your office,

23:42.582 --> 23:44.949
and let's say your favorite pen
went missing from your desk

23:44.951 --> 23:48.319
and they were sitting there
with their arms crossed

23:48.321 --> 23:49.854
tightly across their chest.

23:49.856 --> 23:51.322
What would you think?

23:51.324 --> 23:54.892
I don't know. They...
Maybe they were cold.

23:56.085 --> 23:58.062
This juror is acceptable, Your Honor.

23:58.064 --> 24:00.431
And you, ma'am. Same question.

24:00.433 --> 24:03.067
I'm inclined to think
it means they took the pen,

24:03.069 --> 24:05.836
or at least know something about who did.

24:07.137 --> 24:10.541
We'd like to thank and excuse
this juror, Your Honor.

24:10.543 --> 24:11.909
You, sir.

24:11.911 --> 24:14.895
Who knows? It could mean
a zillion things.

24:15.481 --> 24:18.149
Juror number three is acceptable.

24:18.899 --> 24:22.153
Someone is being interrogated
by the police.

24:22.736 --> 24:25.156
His mouth is dry,
he keeps asking for water,

24:25.158 --> 24:26.757
his body keeps trembling.

24:26.759 --> 24:28.325
What do you make of that?

24:28.327 --> 24:30.961
Tough call without knowing
who's who, what they're in for.

24:30.963 --> 24:33.364
At the very least, I know he's nervous.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.668
Excuse me, Your Honor.

24:39.372 --> 24:41.005
Talk to me.

24:41.007 --> 24:43.607
Could go either way.
Try this. Do a push/pull.

24:43.609 --> 24:45.242
Suggest the answer in the question.

24:45.244 --> 24:46.744
See if that'll sway her.

24:48.846 --> 24:50.114
I'm sorry.

24:50.116 --> 24:53.450
I was asking you about someone
being questioned by the police

24:53.452 --> 24:55.653
and you said that maybe
they were nervous.

24:55.655 --> 24:57.621
Why would you say they were nervous?

24:57.623 --> 24:59.757
Maybe he's afraid he's gonna get caught.

24:59.759 --> 25:03.194
Or maybe they're afraid of being
railroaded by the police

25:03.196 --> 25:04.795
for something they didn't do.

25:04.797 --> 25:08.032
Sure. Maybe. I never thought of that.

25:08.034 --> 25:09.733
Maybe he has a nervous condition.

25:09.735 --> 25:11.869
Could be.

25:11.871 --> 25:14.567
These two jurors are acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

25:14.569 --> 25:17.141
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a jury.

25:17.791 --> 25:19.210
Tell me we're ahead of the curve.

25:19.212 --> 25:20.544
Wish I could.

25:20.546 --> 25:22.146
Based on what I'm hearing,

25:22.148 --> 25:25.716
we'll end up with nine red
jurors and three green jurors.

25:25.718 --> 25:28.619
Well, 25% of the way there. I'll take it.

25:29.011 --> 25:30.688
Prosecution's first witness tomorrow

25:30.690 --> 25:31.956
is Derrick's friend, Josh.

25:31.958 --> 25:33.591
He's on our side. Who knows?

25:33.593 --> 25:35.259
Maybe he'll win us some converts.

25:35.261 --> 25:37.161
Fingers crossed.

25:37.645 --> 25:39.196
Everyone was in a good mood.

25:39.198 --> 25:41.198
I mean, we were having fun.

25:41.690 --> 25:44.220
You know, it was supposed
to be a celebration.

25:44.222 --> 25:45.870
And did you see the defendant

25:45.872 --> 25:47.238
approach the victim, Ms. Richardson?

25:47.240 --> 25:51.745
Sure. We were all watching and kind of

25:51.747 --> 25:53.277
hoping they'd click.

25:53.279 --> 25:54.612
I mean, from our vantage point,

25:54.614 --> 25:56.413
it looked like they'd make
a pretty cute couple.

25:56.415 --> 25:58.015
And then she joined you at your table?

25:58.017 --> 26:01.051
Yes. And she was terrific.

26:01.053 --> 26:04.072
You know, a lot of fun.
You know, full of life.

26:04.074 --> 26:05.985
And he was a perfect gentleman.

26:05.987 --> 26:09.415
You can't let them see your shame.

26:09.417 --> 26:11.741
They won't understand it.
They'll think it's guilt.

26:12.172 --> 26:13.792
Now, is it still your testimony

26:13.794 --> 26:15.126
that everyone was drinking,

26:15.128 --> 26:18.430
and that in addition, there were
narcotics, hydrocodone?

26:19.478 --> 26:22.090
- Yes.
- In fact, you were the one

26:22.092 --> 26:24.326
who provided the drugs,
isn't that correct?

26:24.328 --> 26:25.904
The hydrocodone.

26:26.777 --> 26:28.640
Yes.

26:31.156 --> 26:33.278
And I feel terrible about that.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.113
Really?

26:35.115 --> 26:36.481
Why?

26:37.016 --> 26:39.417
Objection. Relevance?

26:39.419 --> 26:40.785
Rephrase the question.

26:40.787 --> 26:43.082
Sir, you just testified
that you felt terrible

26:43.084 --> 26:44.649
about giving the defendant drugs.

26:44.651 --> 26:48.293
I'm simply asking why, why that
would make you feel terrible.

26:48.295 --> 26:50.050
Objection. Compound.

26:50.052 --> 26:52.796
Overruled. The witness
will answer the question.

26:52.798 --> 26:54.604
I'm not sure I understand what...

26:54.606 --> 26:55.934
Do you feel that if you hadn't

26:55.936 --> 26:57.235
given the defendant drugs,

26:57.237 --> 26:58.757
then maybe he wouldn't have
committed the murder?

26:58.759 --> 26:59.775
Is that what you meant?

26:59.777 --> 27:02.207
Objection! Assumes facts
that are not in evidence.

27:02.209 --> 27:04.142
Leading the witness. Your Honor, please.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.610
The answer will stand.

27:05.612 --> 27:06.722
But that's not what I said.

27:06.724 --> 27:08.484
It's exactly what you said, sir.

27:08.486 --> 27:11.449
You said you felt guilty
about giving your friend drugs.

27:11.451 --> 27:12.884
Would you like the stenographer

27:12.886 --> 27:14.119
to read the transcript back to you?

27:14.121 --> 27:15.120
Objection!

27:15.122 --> 27:17.922
Withdrawn. I have nothing further.

27:21.123 --> 27:23.495
Feels like we're dying here.
Tell me we still got a pulse.

27:23.497 --> 27:24.562
Barely.

27:24.564 --> 27:26.498
We just lost two
of our three green jurors.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.345
It's 11 to one in favor of conviction.

27:41.091 --> 27:44.715
All right. Breakfast for dinner?

27:46.343 --> 27:48.483
Eggs.

27:48.484 --> 27:50.718
Hash browns.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.827
You want something to drink?

27:55.406 --> 28:00.409
You know, I went over this
a hundred times in my head.

28:00.954 --> 28:02.411
I don't know why Josh's testimony

28:02.413 --> 28:04.079
went off the rails like that.

28:04.081 --> 28:07.015
We didn't get any help
from the judge.

28:07.017 --> 28:09.985
I got to say, for a guy
with a corner office

28:09.987 --> 28:11.453
and a gigantic paycheck,

28:11.455 --> 28:14.690
old Josh was not terribly light
on his feet.

28:15.177 --> 28:17.593
Fell right into the A.D.A.'s trap,

28:17.595 --> 28:21.296
and then did nothing to get out of it.

28:23.477 --> 28:26.935
I'm starting to think I've made
a monumental mistake here.

28:27.386 --> 28:28.937
I picked a fight I can't win

28:28.939 --> 28:32.674
and I've raised Derrick's hopes
a second time.

28:33.195 --> 28:36.044
So, tomorrow morning,
Detective Bradley is first up.

28:36.046 --> 28:38.680
Yeah.

28:39.368 --> 28:41.115
I heard his testimony nine years ago.

28:41.117 --> 28:42.818
I'm not looking forward to reliving it.

28:42.820 --> 28:44.665
Well, you got to give it to the guy.

28:45.022 --> 28:47.289
He set out to do something
nearly impossible,

28:47.751 --> 28:48.957
and he did it.

28:49.419 --> 28:53.395
He got an innocent man to admit
to a murder he didn't commit,

28:53.924 --> 28:55.430
and he did it legally.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.132
It's no small feat.

28:57.594 --> 29:01.103
That's really it in a nutshell, isn't it?

29:01.105 --> 29:02.871
That's what's killing us.

29:02.873 --> 29:04.273
What do you mean?

29:04.726 --> 29:07.543
Well, that's the leap
people have trouble making.

29:07.545 --> 29:10.045
We all sit here and think,
“I'd never do that,

29:10.047 --> 29:13.248
no matter how hungry, no matter
how thirsty. I'd never do that”...

29:13.610 --> 29:15.017
But the annals of law are filled

29:15.019 --> 29:17.152
with men and women
who have done just that,

29:17.154 --> 29:21.123
who said, “I did it,” when they didn't.

29:23.861 --> 29:26.195
Finish eating. We got work to do.

29:26.197 --> 29:29.447
So, the murder occurred
on the night of the seventh,

29:29.449 --> 29:31.482
and you showed up
to Mr. Graham's workplace

29:31.484 --> 29:33.502
- the morning of the eighth.
- That's correct.

29:33.504 --> 29:36.939
So, I'm curious,
in the intervening nine hours,

29:37.776 --> 29:39.908
when did you have a chance
to decide that Mr. Graham

29:39.910 --> 29:41.310
was your number one suspect?

29:41.312 --> 29:43.554
Objection. Assuming
facts not in evidence.

29:43.556 --> 29:46.215
Detective Bradley has never
suggested that the defendant

29:46.217 --> 29:47.883
was his number one suspect.

29:47.885 --> 29:49.117
Well, he was.

29:49.119 --> 29:50.819
Objection overruled.

29:52.022 --> 29:53.488
Proceed, Mr. Colón.

29:53.490 --> 29:55.557
So, again...

29:56.153 --> 29:58.060
if you were first notified
about the murder

29:58.062 --> 30:01.697
at 3:00 in the morning
and visited Mr. Graham's office

30:01.699 --> 30:05.300
at 10:30 that same morning,
when was it you decided

30:05.302 --> 30:07.603
that Mr. Graham was likely responsible

30:07.605 --> 30:09.037
for Ashley Richardson's murder?

30:09.039 --> 30:11.406
- As soon as I saw the tape.
- And you're referring

30:11.408 --> 30:13.141
to the surveillance tape
outside of the bar?

30:13.143 --> 30:15.611
- That's correct.
- And what was it you saw on that tape?

30:15.613 --> 30:18.380
I saw the defendant and the
victim leave the bar together

30:18.382 --> 30:21.550
just as the bar was closing;
They were the last ones to go.

30:21.552 --> 30:23.252
They walked away together,

30:23.254 --> 30:26.188
and that's the last time anyone
saw Ashley Richardson alive.

30:26.190 --> 30:28.757
But my client explained to you
when you interviewed him

30:28.759 --> 30:31.393
that after he and the victim
left the bar together,

30:31.395 --> 30:35.330
they stopped at the corner,
outside of the camera's view.

30:35.332 --> 30:36.999
And then each went
in different directions.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.667
Well, he can tell us anything he likes.

30:38.669 --> 30:39.999
That doesn't make it true.

30:40.001 --> 30:41.850
Indeed, but that doesn't
make it false, either.

30:41.852 --> 30:44.940
Objection. The defense attorney
is no longer asking questions,

30:44.942 --> 30:46.808
but rather is making pronouncements.

30:46.810 --> 30:48.739
Objection sustained.

30:48.741 --> 30:52.289
The jury will disregard the
defense counsel's pronouncement.

30:52.291 --> 30:55.684
Okay. I apologize, Your Honor. All right.

30:55.686 --> 30:57.753
Let me come at this a different way.

30:58.173 --> 31:00.656
So, at whatever time it was
that you left the crime scene...

31:00.658 --> 31:02.824
- 4:30 in the morning.
- What did you do?

31:02.826 --> 31:05.160
I went home. I got about
four hours of sleep.

31:05.162 --> 31:06.828
All right, so that's about
8:30 in the morning.

31:06.830 --> 31:07.896
And then what happened?

31:07.898 --> 31:10.299
I went to the station house.
I saw the tape.

31:10.301 --> 31:12.601
I went to Mr. Graham's place of business.

31:12.603 --> 31:13.869
You know the rest.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.505
That it?

31:17.067 --> 31:18.073
Let the record reflect

31:18.075 --> 31:21.410
that the detective answered with a shrug.

31:21.412 --> 31:25.113
So... you didn't go
to Mr. Graham's apartment

31:25.115 --> 31:27.349
- to look for physical evidence?
- Not at that point.

31:27.351 --> 31:31.386
I mean, either corroborate
his alibi or to challenge it

31:31.388 --> 31:36.211
by finding some proof that he
had raped and killed this girl?

31:36.961 --> 31:40.128
Bloodied clothes,
perhaps aa lobby camera

31:40.130 --> 31:42.364
would establish
what time he returned home.

31:42.366 --> 31:43.999
We found his DNA on her clothing.

31:44.001 --> 31:45.233
Because he kissed her,

31:45.235 --> 31:47.102
as he explained when you
questioned him that morning.

31:47.104 --> 31:49.104
Well, maybe he did and maybe he didn't.

31:49.106 --> 31:52.274
Maybe he just raped her,
beat her and strangled her.

31:52.276 --> 31:54.076
Maybe.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.012
But the point is, you'd have
no way of knowing that,

31:57.014 --> 32:00.649
since it sounds like you spent
all of 45 minutes investigating

32:00.651 --> 32:02.835
before you decided
who committed the crime.

32:02.837 --> 32:05.221
Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.689
He's right. I'm not sure
if it was 45 minutes.

32:07.691 --> 32:08.724
Could've been less.

32:09.927 --> 32:11.626
I love it when he does that stuff.

32:11.628 --> 32:13.495
We just got our two green jurors back.

32:13.497 --> 32:16.248
So it is back to nine red
and three green.

32:16.250 --> 32:17.355
Excellent.

32:17.357 --> 32:20.268
That at least gives us
a decent shot at a hung jury.

32:20.270 --> 32:22.371
Let's see if we can't do better.

32:22.373 --> 32:25.003
Isn't it true
that you questioned my client

32:25.005 --> 32:27.416
for over eight hours without
the presence of a lawyer?

32:27.418 --> 32:29.236
- He was free to leave.
- Was he?

32:29.238 --> 32:30.679
Didn't you and a fellow detective

32:30.681 --> 32:31.913
discourage him from leaving

32:31.915 --> 32:33.950
by suggesting it wouldn't look good?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.717
- It wouldn't look good.
- Then why was it necessary

32:35.719 --> 32:37.352
to keep him for over eight hours?

32:37.354 --> 32:38.620
Was he refusing to talk?

32:38.622 --> 32:40.155
- Not at all.
- Or were you just

32:40.157 --> 32:41.857
not hearing what you wanted to hear?

32:41.859 --> 32:43.658
- Objection!
- Overruled.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.635
Isn't it true that my client
told you repeatedly

32:46.637 --> 32:48.348
that he didn't commit the crime?

32:48.350 --> 32:51.066
That it was only after
badgering him for eight hours

32:51.068 --> 32:53.035
that he was finally persuaded

32:53.037 --> 32:55.473
that he might've possibly
committed the crime

32:55.475 --> 32:56.526
and not remembered it?

32:56.528 --> 32:58.373
We're allowed to say whatever it takes

32:58.375 --> 33:00.542
to get a dangerous guy off the street.

33:00.544 --> 33:03.712
Memory is malleable. Wouldn't you agree?

33:03.714 --> 33:06.381
Especially in the face
of an experienced interrogator?

33:06.383 --> 33:10.118
My job is to ask the questions
that get at the truth.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.787
And to do that, you told a lie.

33:11.789 --> 33:13.743
Again, we're allowed
to say whatever it takes.

33:13.745 --> 33:16.658
Man, you told a whopper, didn't you?

33:16.660 --> 33:19.828
You told my client that
the victim identified him,

33:19.830 --> 33:21.730
wrote his name on a piece of paper,

33:21.732 --> 33:23.765
and she did nothing of the kind.

33:23.767 --> 33:26.134
You arrived after the victim was dead.

33:26.136 --> 33:28.203
I did what I needed to do.

33:28.205 --> 33:30.605
To do what? To get to the truth?

33:31.243 --> 33:33.909
Or to get a confession
at any cost so you could say

33:33.911 --> 33:35.210
you solved the case?

33:40.484 --> 33:41.750
One last thing.

33:41.752 --> 33:44.386
Isn't it true that you and the A.D.A.

33:44.388 --> 33:48.223
bribed my client's cell mate
to come here and to claim

33:48.225 --> 33:49.758
my client confessed to him?

33:49.760 --> 33:51.593
A reduced sentence is not a bribe.

33:51.595 --> 33:53.795
That's quite a system you have here.

33:53.797 --> 33:56.785
Youyou lie to suspects,
you bribe witnesses...

33:56.787 --> 33:57.999
Objection!

33:58.001 --> 34:00.408
Sustained. You are perilously close

34:00.410 --> 34:03.138
to contempt, Mr. Colón.

34:05.008 --> 34:06.508
My apologies, Your Honor.

34:06.510 --> 34:09.143
There's only a man's life at stake.

34:09.485 --> 34:11.351
No further questions.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.449
Give me a number.

34:15.452 --> 34:18.120
I am looking at ten green.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.322
I love that number.

34:25.529 --> 34:27.228
We're listening.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.929
Your client pleads guilty,
and I'll recommend

34:28.931 --> 34:30.899
his sentence be reduced to time served.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.367
I don't understand.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.302
I don't have to go back to prison?

34:34.304 --> 34:35.370
Well...

34:35.371 --> 34:37.472
we'll have to go back to the courtroom

34:37.474 --> 34:40.641
and tell the judge that you want
to change your plea to guilty.

34:41.103 --> 34:42.677
So I'd have to tell them
that I murdered Ashley.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.179
Derrick, listen to me.

34:45.181 --> 34:47.382
I know what you're thinking,
I know what you're bumping on.

34:47.384 --> 34:48.617
Let me explain.

34:48.619 --> 34:51.210
We are sitting in this
room because that man

34:51.212 --> 34:53.221
is no longer convinced

34:53.223 --> 34:54.723
that this is a sure thing.

34:54.725 --> 34:56.358
In fact, I'm fairly certain he believes

34:56.360 --> 34:58.960
this is anything but a sure thing.

34:58.962 --> 35:01.830
Unfortunately, the same
is true for our side.

35:01.832 --> 35:03.765
Now, I can't look you in the eye

35:03.767 --> 35:07.435
and tell you that all 12
jurors are gonna let you walk.

35:07.437 --> 35:10.884
I can promise you that a
majority will vote that way,

35:12.135 --> 35:14.876
but that brings us to a mistrial.

35:14.878 --> 35:18.180
And that means we have to go
through all of this again,

35:18.182 --> 35:20.649
and we might get a
different set of cards.

35:20.651 --> 35:22.729
It's a big gamble.

35:23.654 --> 35:27.025
If you take this deal, it's over.

35:28.068 --> 35:30.425
And you've already spent
your last night in prison.

35:31.321 --> 35:33.532
It's only a good deal if you did it.

35:34.824 --> 35:36.431
Then you're getting away with something.

35:36.433 --> 35:38.767
Then you're getting
something for nothing,

35:38.769 --> 35:40.902
but, Dr. Bull, I didn't do it.

35:40.904 --> 35:43.972
I'm not pleading guilty
to something I didn't do.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.941
Today's your lucky day.

35:46.336 --> 35:47.943
I want to take my chances with the jury.

35:47.945 --> 35:49.678
Derrick, please don't do this.

35:50.090 --> 35:51.580
You never know what the jury's gonna do.

35:51.582 --> 35:53.114
This is a bird in the hand.

35:53.116 --> 35:57.085
I don't want a bird. I want my name back.

35:58.288 --> 35:59.621
Even Josh,

35:59.623 --> 36:02.290
my best friend Josh,
you heard him up on the stand.

36:02.292 --> 36:04.726
He tried to hide it, but I could tell.

36:04.728 --> 36:07.095
Even he thinks I'm guilty.

36:09.317 --> 36:11.099
We appreciate the offer, Counselor.

36:12.603 --> 36:15.615
But our client would like to
see this through to the end.

36:24.058 --> 36:26.726
Is he here yet?

36:26.751 --> 36:28.151
He's in your office. Just like you asked.

36:28.153 --> 36:29.285
Did you get him dinner?

36:29.287 --> 36:30.820
- I did.
- Is he eating it?

36:30.822 --> 36:32.388
He was when I left him.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.990
Did you get that information I asked for?

36:33.992 --> 36:35.158
I certainly did.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.060
Now, would you mind
telling us what's going on?

36:38.062 --> 36:39.529
Well, what do we have here?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.664
Well, we're really in Cable country here,

36:41.666 --> 36:44.033
but... I was able to get proof positive

36:44.035 --> 36:45.334
that on the day of the murder,

36:45.336 --> 36:47.637
Josh used his credit card
to buy a MetroCard

36:47.639 --> 36:49.605
for use on the city subways and buses.

36:49.607 --> 36:50.907
And did he swipe the card?

36:50.909 --> 36:53.553
Yes, he did, um, at the
City Hall subway station

36:53.555 --> 36:56.005
three blocks away
from the murder at 2:51 a.m.

36:56.030 --> 36:58.448
Well, it's not enough
to get an arrest warrant

36:58.450 --> 37:01.150
or the charges
against Derrick dropped, but...

37:01.152 --> 37:03.004
Wha... Josh? What makes you think...

37:03.006 --> 37:05.988
It was something Derrick said
in court to me today.

37:06.499 --> 37:09.308
He said he could tell
when Josh was on the stand

37:09.310 --> 37:10.960
that he thought Derrick was guilty.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.528
And it made me start to think:

37:12.530 --> 37:15.598
What did I sense when Josh
was on the stand, and...

37:16.701 --> 37:18.568
it wasn't that at all.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.703
It was something very different.

37:20.705 --> 37:23.473
Just a hunch. See where it goes.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.413
Thank you for coming.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.648
I see Marissa took care of you.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.383
Of course, of course. It sounded urgent.

37:34.385 --> 37:36.486
You guys have a new suspect or something?

37:36.488 --> 37:38.421
Well, kinda, sorta.

37:38.423 --> 37:41.023
Did you know
that when you buy a MetroCard

37:41.025 --> 37:42.625
with a credit card, it's traceable?

37:43.286 --> 37:44.983
Okay. That doesn't surprise me.

37:44.985 --> 37:46.629
I would imagine anything
you buy with a credit card

37:46.631 --> 37:47.930
is probably traceable.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.199
Well, it turns out,
a lot of people used MetroCards

37:50.201 --> 37:53.669
to go to and from the bar the
night that Ashley was killed.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.848
Again, I can't say that surprises me.

37:56.850 --> 37:58.531
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,

37:58.533 --> 38:00.443
but what are we doing here
at 8:00 at night?

38:00.445 --> 38:01.978
Where are you going with all this?

38:01.980 --> 38:03.613
You used the subway that night.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.715
Okay. If you say so.

38:06.142 --> 38:07.984
You swiped your card at a station

38:07.986 --> 38:11.087
not far from either the bar or the park.

38:11.773 --> 38:14.757
And not at 2:00 a.m.,
right after the bar closed,

38:14.759 --> 38:18.828
but closer to 3:00 a.m.,
just after Ashley was killed.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.533
Is this how my friend repays me

38:23.535 --> 38:26.871
for taking the stand twice
in his defense?

38:27.205 --> 38:29.472
He sends his...

38:29.474 --> 38:32.308
Sorry, what are you, anyway?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.410
Not quite lawyer,

38:34.412 --> 38:36.312
to throw a Hail Mary at the last minute

38:36.314 --> 38:38.814
because the trial isn't going his way?

38:42.387 --> 38:44.720
I got real lawyers, Doctor.

38:44.722 --> 38:47.557
And you'll be hearing from them
first thing in the morning.

38:48.351 --> 38:49.625
Well, here's the thing.

38:49.627 --> 38:52.128
We resubmitted Ashley's scarf

38:52.130 --> 38:54.997
to the lab for more
sophisticated DNA testing,

38:54.999 --> 38:58.634
and, well, guess what we found.

38:58.636 --> 39:01.671
Your skin cells, your DNA,

39:01.673 --> 39:03.973
they were both on Ashley's scarf.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.577
No, they weren't.

39:06.828 --> 39:09.512
Where would they get my DNA?

39:09.514 --> 39:11.213
I've never been arrested.

39:11.215 --> 39:13.282
Don't be naive.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.551
You know those drug tests
and security clearances

39:15.553 --> 39:17.386
the SEC puts you through every year?

39:17.388 --> 39:19.088
So you can move all that money around

39:19.090 --> 39:20.323
and make rich people even richer?

39:20.325 --> 39:22.124
Where do you think those lab results go?

39:22.938 --> 39:24.150
I'm calling my lawyer.

39:24.152 --> 39:25.322
Do what you want.

39:25.324 --> 39:27.129
I'm just trying to help you
get ahead of this.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.999
I'm not a police officer,
but I am gonna have to turn over

39:30.001 --> 39:32.468
all the information I have
to A.D.A. Madden.

39:32.470 --> 39:35.538
And I'd love to tell him that
you have been cooperating

39:35.540 --> 39:38.240
and you're willing to tell
your story, and see if I can't

39:38.242 --> 39:40.843
get the powers that be to cut you a deal.

39:40.845 --> 39:44.513
Maybe knock your sentence down
from life to 25 years.

39:44.949 --> 39:46.449
Or...

39:46.451 --> 39:48.119
call your lawyer.

39:48.653 --> 39:53.122
He or she will go in both guns
blazing, and I promise you,

39:53.458 --> 39:55.625
you'll pay full price.

39:55.627 --> 39:58.928
Life in prison. No discount.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.896
And it won't be fun.

40:00.898 --> 40:04.767
Bad as it was for Derrick,
it'll be even worse for you.

40:04.769 --> 40:05.935
Everyone...

40:06.596 --> 40:08.404
will know that you're the guy

40:08.406 --> 40:11.307
who let him rot in a prison cell
while you were sitting

40:11.309 --> 40:15.978
in what should have been his
corner office, making millions.

40:16.546 --> 40:18.213
Think about it.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.236
I'll be here all night.

40:26.391 --> 40:28.357
Tell me something good.

40:28.359 --> 40:30.960
Well, the expedited
test results are back.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.829
The DNA on the food Josh ate
last night matches

40:33.831 --> 40:35.431
the DNA on the scarf.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.932
Thank goodness, 'cause he just confessed

40:36.934 --> 40:38.934
to the A.D.A. in his office.

40:40.129 --> 40:41.504
Wait a second.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.606
You got him to admit to the murder

40:43.608 --> 40:45.474
before you had the DNA results?

40:45.476 --> 40:48.344
I may not have been entirely
clear with him about that.

40:48.346 --> 40:51.781
Darn. I hope he didn't misunderstand me.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.393
I understand you have
a motion, Mr. Madden?

40:54.395 --> 40:56.519
Your Honor, due to
recently uncovered evidence,

40:56.521 --> 40:59.255
the people move to dismiss
the charge of murder

40:59.257 --> 41:01.057
against Mr. Derrick Graham.

41:01.734 --> 41:03.659
Is that acceptable to the defense?

41:03.661 --> 41:06.762
No, Your Honor.
A dismissal is not enough.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.104
My client is seeking
complete vindication.

41:09.106 --> 41:12.996
We are asking the court to
enter a finding of not guilty.

41:16.624 --> 41:17.973
No objection.

41:18.793 --> 41:21.043
Then I'm finding the defendant not guilty

41:21.045 --> 41:24.714
and ordering that he be
released from custody forthwith.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.217
Court is adjourned.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.956
Thank you.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.458
You saved my life.

41:35.460 --> 41:36.959
No.

41:36.961 --> 41:40.629
I failed you, and you gave me
a second chance.

41:41.191 --> 41:42.891
Thank you.

41:46.779 --> 41:48.337
Gentlemen.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.505
Excuse me.

41:49.507 --> 41:52.408
Mr. Graham, I realize
this is an awkward moment,

41:52.410 --> 41:55.611
but this woman says
that you stole her dessert.

41:55.613 --> 41:57.580
Pretty much every night.

41:58.041 --> 41:59.315
Sis.

42:00.376 --> 42:02.218
Connie.

42:06.883 --> 42:08.885
You found his sister.

42:09.802 --> 42:11.460
We do what we can.

42:14.891 --> 42:16.966
Shoot.

42:16.968 --> 42:19.869
It's my daughter. I just missed it.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.871
- Did she leave a message?
- Yeah.

42:23.074 --> 42:24.206
Excuse me.

42:31.741 --> 42:33.249
Hi, Uncle Chunk.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.451
Dad.

42:35.453 --> 42:37.753
Um, I'm excited about coming to New York,

42:38.206 --> 42:40.790
excited about seeing you.

42:40.792 --> 42:43.692
And also scared and worried.

42:44.170 --> 42:46.762
I know it makes no sense.

42:47.382 --> 42:49.832
I keep having this dream
that I'll get to the airport

42:49.834 --> 42:51.767
and you won't be there.

42:51.769 --> 42:53.636
Crazy, right?

42:53.638 --> 42:57.139
I guess also I'm a little mad at you.

42:57.725 --> 43:01.043
17 years is a long time to wait
to meet your father.

43:01.045 --> 43:04.180
Lots of birthdays
and Christmases to miss.

43:04.182 --> 43:06.025
It's kind of a shame.

43:07.068 --> 43:08.851
Anyway, I'll see you next week.

43:08.853 --> 43:10.786
Love you, Dad.
