WEBVTT

00:01.372 --> 00:03.274
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:03.274 --> 00:04.375
EVERYBODY THINKS
THAT YOU ARE DEAD.
 AND THAT'S THE WAY
IT HAS TO STAY.

00:04.375 --> 00:06.137
JUST IN TIME.

00:06.137 --> 00:08.039
YOUR DAUGHTER'S A DRUG ADDICT,
AND YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD.

00:08.039 --> 00:10.311
THAT MAKES YOU BOTH
DAMN EASY TO DISPOSE OF.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.113
I PICKED UP
THE TEST RESULTS.

00:12.113 --> 00:15.046
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
YOU'RE GONNA BE A DADDY.

00:15.046 --> 00:16.517
PLEASE TELL ME
IT'S REALLY HIS.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.419
SORRY.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.091
DON'T PRETEND FOR ONE MOMENT

00:20.091 --> 00:22.153
THAT YOU DIDN'T TRY
TO MURDER ME.

00:22.153 --> 00:23.394
I WARNED YOU NOT
TO GET ONTO THAT PLANE.

00:23.394 --> 00:27.098
WHATEVER HAPPENS FROM THIS POINT
FORWARD STAYS BETWEEN US.

00:27.098 --> 00:28.629
(clanks)

00:28.629 --> 00:30.701
SO WHAT'S NEXT?
 HIT ME.

00:30.701 --> 00:34.535
WHO DID THIS?
 YOU DID, AND IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULD START RUNNING.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.536
(siren wailing)

00:35.536 --> 00:37.408
YOU ONCE SAID
I WAS LIKE MY MOTHER.

00:37.408 --> 00:40.541
YOU KNEW HER, DIDN'T YOU?
 UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S
SOMETHING YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.243
(panting)

00:42.243 --> 00:43.514
(gunshot)
 (grunts)

00:43.514 --> 00:45.216
(panting)

00:45.216 --> 00:50.321
(Emily) IN A RACE BETWEEN
DANGER AND INDECISION,

00:50.321 --> 00:51.722
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH...

00:51.722 --> 00:54.255
(barking)
 COMES DOWN TO CONFIDENCE.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.257
FAITH IN OUR ABILITIES,

00:56.257 --> 00:59.430
CERTAINTY IN OURSELVES...

00:59.430 --> 01:00.661
(panting)

01:00.661 --> 01:01.832
(dogs continue barking)

01:01.832 --> 01:03.134
COME ON. RIGHT AHEAD.

01:03.134 --> 01:04.295
(grunts)

01:04.295 --> 01:05.465
(barking continues)

01:05.465 --> 01:08.169
AND THE TRUST
WE PUT IN OTHERS.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.272
(barking)

01:11.272 --> 01:12.743
(Emily) WE'RE TRAPPED.

01:12.743 --> 01:15.606
(barking continues)

01:15.606 --> 01:17.208
WE GOTTA GO OVER.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.180
(barking continues)

01:19.180 --> 01:21.582
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

01:21.582 --> 01:25.316
(barking)

01:25.316 --> 01:27.087
(grunts)

01:27.087 --> 01:29.320
(groans) EMILY, WAIT.
MY LEG.

01:29.320 --> 01:30.461
YOU OKAY?

01:30.461 --> 01:31.792
HEY!

01:31.792 --> 01:33.224
THE RACE IS WON.

01:33.224 --> 01:34.395
HE CHEATED.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.467
(Takeda) YES. HE UNDERSTOOD
THE EXERCISE--

01:36.467 --> 01:38.329
TO EXPLOIT
YOUR OPPONENT'S WEAKNESS.

01:38.329 --> 01:40.131
THAT IS THE KEY TO REVENGE.

01:40.131 --> 01:42.703
LOSE YOUR COMPASSION.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.376
(panting)

01:45.376 --> 01:47.438
NO HARD FEELINGS.

01:47.438 --> 01:48.709
WHY?!

01:48.709 --> 01:50.681
(panting)

01:50.681 --> 01:52.383
HE WANTED YOU DEAD.

01:52.383 --> 01:54.315
(knife clicks closed)
 I PREFER YOU ALIVE.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.147
AND I PREFER YOU
10,000 MILES AWAY FROM HERE.

01:56.147 --> 01:57.648
TELL TAKEDA
I DON'T NEED A NANNY.

01:57.648 --> 02:00.251
TAKEDA DIDN'T SEND ME.
 HE DIDN'T STOP YOU EITHER.

02:00.251 --> 02:02.153
ARE YOU GONNA GET OUT,
OR DO I NEED TO THROW YOU OUT?

02:02.153 --> 02:03.624
WHAT YOU NEED RIGHT NOW

02:03.624 --> 02:05.226
IS MY HELP.

02:05.226 --> 02:08.229
(panting)

02:09.560 --> 02:11.562
(Daniel) SHE'S CLEANING.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.466
SHE DOES THAT
WHEN SHE CAN'T SLEEP.

02:15.466 --> 02:17.538
PERHAPS I SHOULD
GIVE IT A TRY.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.869
WELL, GIVEN
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,

02:18.869 --> 02:20.741
INSOMNIA SEEMS REASONABLE.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.274
I WONDER
WHAT HER EXCUSE IS.

02:23.274 --> 02:27.218
(waves crashing)

02:27.218 --> 02:29.250
YOU MISS HER, DON'T YOU?

02:29.250 --> 02:31.282
I'VE SPENT A LOT OF
RESTLESS NIGHTS OUT HERE, MOM.

02:31.282 --> 02:33.884
EITHER YOU LOOK AT THE OCEAN
OR EMILY'S HOUSE.

02:33.884 --> 02:35.586
IT'S SIMPLE GEOGRAPHY.

02:35.586 --> 02:37.488
BESIDES,
I'M WITH ASHLEY NOW.

02:37.488 --> 02:39.390
YET, YOU'RE STILL RESTLESS.

02:39.390 --> 02:42.393
(helicopter whirring overhead)

02:44.335 --> 02:45.496
WELL, IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO SLEEP

02:45.496 --> 02:46.837
WITH ALL THOSE REPORTERS
CAMPED OUTSIDE THE GATE

02:46.837 --> 02:48.839
AND CLUTTERING THE SKY.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.701
THE NEWS HOUNDS WON'T STOP
UNTIL THEY GET MY STORY.

02:50.701 --> 02:52.543
AND WHAT EXACTLY IS
YOUR STORY?

02:54.445 --> 02:56.577
(cell phone rings)

02:56.577 --> 02:57.748
HELLO?

02:57.748 --> 02:59.810
(White-haired Man)
Do you know who this is?

02:59.810 --> 03:01.652
(Victoria) Yes.

03:01.652 --> 03:03.183
NOT AN EASY VOICE TO FORGET.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.885
After the ding
of the seat belt sign,

03:04.885 --> 03:06.217
THE NEXT SOUND YOU'LL HEAR

03:06.217 --> 03:08.719
WILL BE 14 OUNCES OF
PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES DETONATING.

03:08.719 --> 03:10.521
My proposition--

03:10.521 --> 03:13.324
CONRAD'S DEMISE
IS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL.

03:13.324 --> 03:15.326
ALL IT REQUIRES IS SPLITTING
CHARLOTTE'S INHERITANCE.

03:15.326 --> 03:17.828
DECLINE, AND YOUR DAUGHTER
WILL BE JOINING YOU

03:17.828 --> 03:19.970
IN THE GRAYSON FAMILY PLOT.

03:21.572 --> 03:23.604
I'M LISTENING.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.378
AND YOU'RE CERTAIN IT WAS
THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN?

03:27.378 --> 03:29.780
OF COURSE.

03:29.780 --> 03:31.542
WHO ELSE?

03:31.542 --> 03:33.414
I'M JUST WONDERING

03:33.414 --> 03:35.286
HOW HE COULD'VE BOARDED
THE PLANE

03:35.286 --> 03:38.619
COMPLETELY UNDETECTED
BY GROUND CREW.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.492
YOU SOUND LIKE A JOURNALIST.

03:41.492 --> 03:43.794
OR EVEN WORSE,
A DETECTIVE.

03:43.794 --> 03:47.358
DETECTIVES ARE STILL
ON YOUR SIDE LAST I CHECKED.

03:47.358 --> 03:50.301
AND THE IMPLICATION
IS THAT YOU ARE NOT?

03:51.762 --> 03:54.305
I DON'T KNOW.

03:57.408 --> 03:59.670
HMM.

04:06.317 --> 04:09.420
GORDON MURPHY.

04:11.282 --> 04:12.723
(pills rattle)

04:12.723 --> 04:14.425
WHAT ARE THOSE?

04:15.726 --> 04:17.027
(rattles)

04:17.027 --> 04:18.728
WELL, I HEARD
WHAT MR. MURPHY HERE SAID

04:18.728 --> 04:20.861
ABOUT DISOBEYING THE ORDER
TO KILL YOUR MOTHER.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.533
THAT DOESN'T MEAN

04:22.533 --> 04:25.636
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE
DIDN'T FINISH THE JOB.

04:25.636 --> 04:27.438
(clatter)

04:28.939 --> 04:31.372
(cell phone ringing)

04:31.372 --> 04:33.043
YOU GOING TO ANSWER
YOUR PHONE?

04:33.043 --> 04:35.376
(ring)

04:35.376 --> 04:37.277
(ring)

04:37.277 --> 04:39.510
(ring, beep)

04:39.510 --> 04:41.011
VICTORIA.

04:41.011 --> 04:44.385
DON'T THINK ME INTRUSIVE,
BUT I SEE THAT YOU'RE AWAKE.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.587
I WAS JUST TURNING IN.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.390
Well, I thought
the events of the day

04:49.390 --> 04:51.692
MIGHT BE KEEPING YOU UP.
(chuckles)

04:51.692 --> 04:54.865
NO, IT'S THE REPORTERS
THAT KEEP KNOCKING ON MY DOOR.

04:54.865 --> 04:56.697
THEY SAW ME LEAVING
GRAYSON MANOR EARLIER.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.530
THEY WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.902
WELL, I TRUST
YOU STAVED THEM OFF.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.435
SO FAR.
BUT THEY ARE PERSISTENT.

05:04.435 --> 05:05.476
Yes, they are.

05:05.476 --> 05:07.338
Come over tomorrow,

05:07.338 --> 05:09.440
AND WE'LL DISCUSS A STRATEGY
ON HOW TO HANDLE THEM.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.782
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
GOOD NIGHT, VICTORIA.

05:11.782 --> 05:13.013
(beep)

05:13.013 --> 05:15.386
LET ME SEE MURPHY'S PHONE.

05:15.386 --> 05:17.047
IT'S DESTROYED,
THANKS TO YOU.

05:17.047 --> 05:18.789
AND WHY DO YOU WANT IT
ANYWAY?

05:18.789 --> 05:20.491
TO FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED--

05:20.491 --> 05:22.092
IDENTIFY AND TAKE DOWN
THE INITIATIVE.

05:22.092 --> 05:23.954
THIS MAN WAS THEIR AGENT.

05:23.954 --> 05:26.497
THAT PHONE
COULD LEAD US TO THEM.

05:26.497 --> 05:28.098
THIS PHONE
COULD LEAD TO MY MOTHER.

05:28.098 --> 05:29.329
I AM KEEPING IT.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.502
LOOK,
THE LOSS OF YOUR MOTHER--

05:31.502 --> 05:33.364
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT FEELS.

05:33.364 --> 05:35.766
BUT DO NOT LET IT DISTRACT YOU
FROM YOUR TRUE MISSION.

05:35.766 --> 05:37.508
YOU ARE BETTER THAN THAT.

05:37.508 --> 05:40.611
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE. NOW.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.613
SORRY.
I'VE GOT OTHER INSTRUCTIONS.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.114
TAKEDA.

05:44.114 --> 05:46.046
I THOUGHT
HE DIDN'T SEND YOU.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.849
HE'S LOST FAITH.
I'M HERE TO RESTORE IT.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.381
SO SOONER OR LATER,

05:50.381 --> 05:51.682
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO START
TRUSTING ME AGAIN.

05:51.682 --> 05:54.485
NOW... ARE YOU
GONNA TAKE THE HEAD

05:54.485 --> 05:56.487
OR THE FEET?

06:02.032 --> 06:03.894
(grunts)

06:03.894 --> 06:05.496
(pants)

06:05.496 --> 06:16.376
THE HEAD.

06:23.914 --> 06:26.016
(lowered voice)
LEAVE THE LITTLE STUFF.

06:26.016 --> 06:27.918
JUST JEWELRY AND CASH.
CHECK THE DESK.

06:31.762 --> 06:33.764
(lowered voice) HEY, HEY.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.966
OH, NICE.
HEY, KEEP LOOKING.

06:35.966 --> 06:39.470
NO. NO, LOOK, WE GOT ENOUGH.
I'M CALLING IT.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.632
PFFT. TO PAY FOR
FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE?

06:41.632 --> 06:43.904
NOT ALL IN ONE NIGHT
AND FROM THE SAME HOUSE, MAN.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.176
WHO LEAVES A BASEBALL
SIGNED BY BABE RUTH

06:46.176 --> 06:49.440
OUT IN THE OPEN? A GUY
WHO CAN AFFORD ANOTHER ONE.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.011
(switch clicks)
 (woman) I'M EXHAUSTED.

06:51.011 --> 06:54.014
OKAY, NOW WE CALL IT.
COME ON.
 (man) I'M GONNA CHECK MY E-MAIL.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.887
(sniffs)

07:00.621 --> 07:01.792
MMM.

07:01.792 --> 07:05.956
♪♪♪

07:05.956 --> 07:07.698
CAN'T SLEEP?

07:07.698 --> 07:09.630
(sighs)

07:09.630 --> 07:11.101
WHOEVER SAID WARM MILK
DOES THE TRICK

07:11.101 --> 07:13.103
OBVIOUSLY NEVER TASTED IT.

07:13.103 --> 07:14.765
YOU KNOW, PRETTY SOON,

07:14.765 --> 07:18.609
LATE NIGHTS ARE GONNA BE
A REGULAR THING.

07:18.609 --> 07:20.040
YOU READY?

07:20.040 --> 07:24.044
NOT UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT
THE NURSERY.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.017
I'M NOT DOING LATE-NIGHT
FEEDINGS BY THE BEER TAPS.

07:27.017 --> 07:28.649
(sighs)

07:28.649 --> 07:29.820
(sighs)

07:29.820 --> 07:31.151
ALL RIGHT, LOOK...
(blows air)

07:31.151 --> 07:33.453
HOW ABOUT THIS?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.625
DECLAN'S ROOM--

07:34.625 --> 07:36.126
FRESH COAT OF PAINT,
STEAM CLEAN THE RUGS,

07:36.126 --> 07:38.959
BRING MY GRANDMA'S ROCKING CHAIR
DOWN FROM THE ATTIC.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.931
CHEAP AND CHEERFUL,
JUST FOR THE SHORT TERM.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.462
(chuckles) OR...

07:42.462 --> 07:44.665
WE CAN USE
THE GIFT CERTIFICATE

07:44.665 --> 07:47.838
CHARLOTTE SENT US FROM THAT
FANCY BABY STORE IN THE VILLAGE

07:47.838 --> 07:48.999
AND DO UP THE ROOM
IN STYLE.

07:48.999 --> 07:50.470
$5,000?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.503
NO, NO, NO. WE DON'T ACCEPT
CHARITY FROM THE GRAYSONS.

07:52.503 --> 07:54.104
THEY CAN BUY THEIR WAY
INTO THE HEADLINES.

07:54.104 --> 07:55.976
THEY'RE NOT BUYING THEIR WAY
INTO MY CHILD'S LIFE.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.579
TECHNICALLY,
CHARLOTTE IS NOT A GRAYSON.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.050
SHE'S A CLARKE, LIKE ME,
AND SHE'S EXCITED TO BE AN AUNT.

08:00.050 --> 08:01.582
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

08:01.582 --> 08:03.554
SHE CAN BE AN AUNT
WITHOUT THROWING MONEY AT US.

08:03.554 --> 08:05.085
JUST...

08:05.085 --> 08:08.118
RETURN THE GIFT, AMANDA.
I'LL SORT OUT THE BABY'S ROOM.

08:08.118 --> 08:10.090
(sighs)

08:16.096 --> 08:19.099
(seagull crying)

08:19.099 --> 08:21.101
I'VE SPOKEN TO MY CONTACT
AT "VANITY FAIR"

08:21.101 --> 08:24.174
AND CONFIRMED THEIR ONE-ON-ONE
WITH MRS. GRAYSON.

08:24.174 --> 08:25.706
YOU'RE GOING PUBLIC?

08:25.706 --> 08:28.038
SHE'S GOING NUCLEAR.
YOUR MOTHER...

08:28.038 --> 08:32.082
IS INVITING EVERY VULTURE
IN THE SKY DOWN FOR A FEAST,

08:32.082 --> 08:33.683
ATTEMPTING TO CAPITALIZE

08:33.683 --> 08:36.015
ON THE ONE THING
SHE'S NEVER REALLY HAD--

08:36.015 --> 08:37.788
SYMPATHY.

08:37.788 --> 08:40.049
(Ashley) I'VE COME UP
WITH A LIST OF TALKING POINTS.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.191
WE'RE KEEPING IT VAGUE,

08:41.191 --> 08:43.222
AVOIDING THE GORY DETAILS,

08:43.222 --> 08:46.196
AND FOCUSING ON
VICTORIA'S MIRACULOUS RETURN.

08:46.196 --> 08:48.198
DANIEL AND I
DON'T NEED TALKING POINTS.

08:48.198 --> 08:49.760
WE WEREN'T INVOLVED.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.562
(Daniel)
WHAT DO THE AUTHORITIES SAY?

08:51.562 --> 08:53.103
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT
THEIR INVESTIGATION?

08:53.103 --> 08:54.104
(Victoria) WELL, THE MORE PEOPLE
WHO KNOW WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR,

08:54.104 --> 08:56.136
THE BETTER CHANCE WE HAVE
OF FINDING HIM.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.538
UNTIL THEN,
NO ONE LEAVES THIS HOUSE,

08:58.538 --> 09:00.941
AND NO ONE ADDRESSES
THE PRESS ALONE.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.242
YOU'RE GROUNDING ALL OF US?

09:02.242 --> 09:05.946
IT'S SAFER TO STAY INSIDE
UNTIL THIS MEDIA STORM PASSES.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.950
OH, ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.322
SOMEONE PLEASE PASS
THE PAIN DE MIE.

09:12.322 --> 09:14.054
(Nolan) IT'S TOAST.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.656
CAN YOU RECOVER
THE CONTACT LIST?

09:15.656 --> 09:17.127
WAIT.

09:17.127 --> 09:18.959
IS THAT A BULLET HOLE?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.061
CAN YOU FIX IT OR NOT?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.734
OH, I'M SORRY.
WON'T ASK, WON'T TELL, WILL FIX.

09:23.734 --> 09:26.166
AT LEAST, I'LL TRY.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.137
OH! YOU'RE ACTUALLY HERE.

09:27.137 --> 09:28.298
OH.

09:28.298 --> 09:30.240
IGNORE MY TEXT
TELLING YOU TO WAKE UP.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.571
OH, DON'T WE HAVE A MEETING?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.204
WE DO. YOU'VE JUST NEVER
SHOWN UP TO ONE BEFORE.

09:34.204 --> 09:35.575
HMM.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.047
OH, EMILY,
THIS IS PADMA LAHARI,

09:37.047 --> 09:39.179
MY NEW C.F.O.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.051
THE I.R.S. IS ALL UP
IN NOLCORP'S GRILL,

09:41.051 --> 09:43.283
AND LUCKILY PADMA
IS THE AUDIT WHISPERER.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.015
HMM.

09:45.015 --> 09:47.187
UM, PADMA, THIS IS EMILY,
MY... UH...

09:47.187 --> 09:48.859
(telephone rings)

09:48.859 --> 09:49.890
MY...

09:49.890 --> 09:51.291
E-EMILY.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.223
MM. NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:53.223 --> 09:54.925
HAVE A GOOD MEETING.

09:54.925 --> 09:56.226
MM.

09:58.769 --> 10:00.270
SHE'S VERY PRETTY.

10:00.270 --> 10:01.371
MM.

10:01.371 --> 10:02.673
HOW DO YOU KNOW HER?

10:02.673 --> 10:04.835
OH, WE COHABITATE.

10:04.835 --> 10:07.237
WELL, SHE ASKED ME TO MOVE OUT.
I...

10:08.709 --> 10:11.181
IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLICATED.

10:13.283 --> 10:16.286
(beeping)

10:20.150 --> 10:22.192
(crash)

10:22.192 --> 10:25.125
(whirring)

10:34.104 --> 10:37.207
HEY, GET OFF MY TRUCK!

10:39.209 --> 10:41.411
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

10:46.246 --> 10:47.918
(keys jangle)

10:51.051 --> 10:52.983
(typing)

10:52.983 --> 10:55.726
ANIMAL SHELTERS?
OH, GOD.

10:55.726 --> 10:57.227
DON'T TELL ME YOU WANT
A PET.

10:57.227 --> 10:59.329
I'M LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO VOLUNTEER

10:59.329 --> 11:01.191
SO I DON'T HAVE TO SPEND
MY ENTIRE SUMMER

11:01.191 --> 11:02.993
IN THIS HOUSE OF DYSFUNCTION.

11:02.993 --> 11:06.136
EVERYONE ELSE KNOWS WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED TO YOU, MOM.

11:06.136 --> 11:07.297
WHY CAN'T DANIEL?

11:07.297 --> 11:08.268
THE LAST TIME
PUSH CAME TO SHOVE,

11:08.268 --> 11:09.970
HE CHOSE TO ALIGN HIMSELF
WITH HIS FATHER.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.172
HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED...

11:12.172 --> 11:13.874
YET. (sighs)

11:13.874 --> 11:15.205
(paper rustles)

11:15.205 --> 11:18.178
YOU SPENT $5,000
AT A BABY STORE?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.910
IT'S A GIFT FOR AMANDA.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.211
SHE IS MY SISTER.

11:21.211 --> 11:23.283
HALF SISTER, IF THAT.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.086
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

11:26.086 --> 11:27.357
NEVER MIND.

11:27.357 --> 11:29.089
(sets down paper)

11:29.089 --> 11:31.221
LOOK, THE FACT THAT
DAVID CLARKE IS YOUR FATHER

11:31.221 --> 11:33.323
IS A SECRET
WE HAVE TO GUARD CLOSELY

11:33.323 --> 11:35.095
FOR VARIOUS REASONS.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.696
FOR NOW,

11:36.696 --> 11:38.869
YOU NEED TO STAY AWAY
FROM THAT GIRL.

11:38.869 --> 11:40.470
I'M STAYING AWAY
FROM EVERYONE.

11:40.470 --> 11:42.002
WE'RE SEQUESTERED, REMEMBER?

11:42.002 --> 11:44.274
NO ONE COMES IN.
NO ONE GOES OUT.

11:44.274 --> 11:48.038
WELL,
WITH ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION.

11:48.038 --> 11:49.910
(Emily) SO WHAT STORY
ARE WE TELLING?

11:49.910 --> 11:51.812
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING WRONG

11:51.812 --> 11:53.343
TO THE PRESS.

11:53.343 --> 11:56.016
WELL, THE ANSWER'S SIMPLE.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.988
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

11:57.988 --> 12:00.150
YOU BARELY KNOW US.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.252
I WAS ENGAGED TO YOUR SON.

12:02.252 --> 12:03.794
"EVER SINCE
DANIEL BROKE IT OFF,

12:03.794 --> 12:05.725
THE GRAYSONS HAVE KEPT ME
AT ARM'S LENGTH."

12:05.725 --> 12:07.998
SEE? SIMPLE.

12:07.998 --> 12:10.330
AND IT'S THE TRUTH.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.432
HMM.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.364
(sets down cup)

12:16.406 --> 12:17.467
(sighs) VICTORIA.

12:17.467 --> 12:18.869
HMM?

12:18.869 --> 12:20.871
ARE YOU AND CHARLOTTE
SAFE HERE?

12:20.871 --> 12:22.873
(chuckles) THIS HOUSE
MAY AS WELL BE A FORTRESS.

12:22.873 --> 12:24.474
I'M TALKING ABOUT CONRAD.

12:24.474 --> 12:27.117
HE TRIED TO HAVE YOU KILLED.

12:27.117 --> 12:29.519
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT CONRAD.

12:29.519 --> 12:32.783
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM
IN TIME.

12:32.783 --> 12:35.285
I'M MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU, EMILY.

12:36.526 --> 12:38.388
AND WHY IS THAT?

12:38.388 --> 12:39.890
EVER SINCE SHARING MY SECRET,

12:39.890 --> 12:42.292
YOUR WELFARE HAS BEEN
AT RISK, I'M AFRAID.

12:42.292 --> 12:45.195
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO ENSURE YOUR SAFETY

12:45.195 --> 12:47.037
IS BY CUTTING OFF ALL TIES
TO MY FAMILY,

12:47.037 --> 12:49.299
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

12:49.299 --> 12:50.871
I HATE TO SEE
OUR NEWFOUND FRIENDSHIP

12:50.871 --> 12:52.372
COME TO AN END.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.374
BUT I HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO STAY AWAY,

12:54.374 --> 12:56.446
PERMANENTLY.

12:56.446 --> 13:00.280
I'LL HAVE SECURITY
SHOW YOU HOME.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.252
(sets down cup)

13:05.956 --> 13:10.160
(birds chirping)

13:15.365 --> 13:17.427
(doorknob clicking)

13:23.473 --> 13:25.175
(door creaks)

14:05.545 --> 14:07.447
THERE'S NO LOITERING HERE.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.520
YOU WANT A ROOM,
YOU NEED TO COME INSIDE.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.423
(American accent)
NO NEED, MA'AM. DETECTIVE LASKY.

14:13.423 --> 14:15.956
SOUTHAMPTON POLICE.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.427
IN A RENTAL CAR?

14:17.427 --> 14:19.859
DEPARTMENT CUTBACKS.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.361
HAVE YOU, UH...

14:23.033 --> 14:24.394
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?

14:24.394 --> 14:26.466
HE MIGHT BE...

14:26.466 --> 14:28.438
SOMEONE THAT CHECKED IN
A WEEK AGO.

14:28.438 --> 14:32.172
PAID CASH.
STAYED ONE NIGHT.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.944
WHAT'S HE WANTED FOR?

14:33.944 --> 14:36.306
KIDNAPPING.

14:36.306 --> 14:37.477
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.210
THIS IS
A VERY DANGEROUS MAN.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.381
THANK YOU.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.612
OKAY.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.517
(dials cell phone)

14:47.517 --> 14:49.619
(phone rings)

14:49.619 --> 14:51.561
SOUTHAMPTON POLICE DEPARTMENT.

14:51.561 --> 14:53.263
(woman) Southampton Police.
 (engine starts)

14:53.263 --> 14:54.925
YES, I NEED TO SPEAK WITH, UM,
DETECTIVE LASKY, PLEASE.

14:54.925 --> 14:56.596
No one here by that name.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.398
You might want to try
the East Hampton Police.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.271
People make that mistake...

15:01.271 --> 15:03.403
(beep)

15:07.607 --> 15:09.179
(seagull calling)

15:09.179 --> 15:12.182
KIND OF SPARSE
FOR A NEWBORN.

15:12.182 --> 15:14.244
(chuckles) YEAH, WELL,

15:14.244 --> 15:18.088
IT WOULDN'T BE IF JACK HAD
ACCEPTED CHARLOTTE'S GIFT.

15:18.088 --> 15:19.689
HE'S DETERMINED
TO KEEP ALL THINGS GRAYSON

15:19.689 --> 15:21.151
OUT OF THE BABY'S LIFE.

15:21.151 --> 15:25.455
MM. HE'S GOT GOOD INSTINCTS.

15:25.455 --> 15:29.559
UNFORTUNATELY, VICTORIA HAS
BANISHED ME FROM HER PREMISES.

15:29.559 --> 15:32.232
I NEED YOU
TO DELIVER SOMETHING FOR ME.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.204
IT'S ONE OF
MY FATHER'S JOURNALS,

15:34.204 --> 15:36.136
OR AT LEAST
MY VERSION OF IT.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.208
VICTORIA'S HAVING
A PRESS CONFERENCE.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.710
THIS PRESS PASS WILL GET YOU
THROUGH SECURITY.

15:40.710 --> 15:42.242
(scoffs) ARE YOU NUTS?

15:42.242 --> 15:45.175
I PROMISED JACK I WOULDN'T GO
ANYWHERE NEAR THE GRAYSONS.

15:45.175 --> 15:46.676
SO LIE.

15:46.676 --> 15:48.478
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.282
SHOW THIS TO CHARLOTTE
TO THANK HER FOR HER GIFT.

15:52.282 --> 15:54.254
I TOLD YOU,
I'M RETURNING THE GIFT.

15:55.425 --> 15:57.527
I'VE WANTED A FAMILY
MY WHOLE LIFE.

15:57.527 --> 15:59.559
I'M NOT JEOPARDIZING THAT
FOR YOU OR ANYONE ELSE.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.362
(sighs)

16:02.362 --> 16:04.995
I THOUGHT WE WERE FAMILY.

16:04.995 --> 16:08.168
WHEN WE EXCHANGED IDENTITIES,
THE PLAN WAS CLEAR.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.170
YOU BECOME MY PAST...

16:10.170 --> 16:12.202
AND I BECOME YOUR FUTURE.

16:12.202 --> 16:14.444
TURNS OUT, I WAS WRONG.

16:14.444 --> 16:18.248
LOOKS LIKE THE FUTURE
BELONGS TO YOU.

16:19.479 --> 16:23.453
PLEASE DO THIS FOR ME.

16:25.615 --> 16:28.318
(Nolan)
I REMEMBER THIS DINNER--

16:28.318 --> 16:31.221
MELINDA GATES AND PRINCE, UH,
SOMETHING OR OTHER

16:31.221 --> 16:32.562
AT PER SE.

16:32.562 --> 16:36.196
IT'S $3,000. THAT'S MORE
THAN TWICE MY RENT.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.228
WELL, THE ROYALS
LOVE THEIR BUBBLY.

16:38.228 --> 16:40.730
SPEAKING OF, UM,
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

16:40.730 --> 16:44.234
I SUPPOSE IT'S NOT TOO EARLY
TO START THINKING ABOUT DINNER.

16:44.234 --> 16:45.735
A WORKING DINNER, OF COURSE,

16:45.735 --> 16:47.237
WHICH IS A COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE
BUSINESS WRITE-OFF...

16:47.237 --> 16:48.578
(cell phone ringing)

16:48.578 --> 16:50.310
UNLIKE 90% OF THE RECEIPTS
I SEE HERE TODAY.
 OH.

16:51.341 --> 16:53.243
EMS, HEY.

16:53.243 --> 16:54.744
HOW ARE WE
ON THE PHONE FIX?

16:54.744 --> 16:57.287
(scoffs) "FIX" MAY BE
TOO STRONG A WORD.

16:57.287 --> 16:59.289
HARDWARE'S FRIED.

16:59.289 --> 17:01.791
Contacts, data, text history

17:01.791 --> 17:05.224
ALL BIT THE DUST OR THE BULLET,
AS IT WERE. (chuckles)

17:05.224 --> 17:06.726
WHAT ABOUT THE SIM CARD?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.098
WELL, THE ONLY THING
I COULD PULL FROM IT

17:08.098 --> 17:09.659
IS THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN'S
OWN NUMBER,

17:09.659 --> 17:12.031
AND, WELL,
HE'S NOT ANSWERING.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.104
THAT'S STILL HELPFUL.
CAN YOU GET IT TO ME?

17:14.104 --> 17:15.635
THE PHONE OR THE SIM CARD?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.337
BOTH,
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.637
OH, I LOVE IT WHEN YOU'RE BOSSY.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.339
IT MEANS
SOMETHING HOT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.571
SO WHAT CAN I LOOK FORWARD TO?

17:22.571 --> 17:24.243
WATCH THE 10:00 NEWS.

17:24.243 --> 17:26.415
I'M COUNTING THE HOURS.

17:26.415 --> 17:28.478
(beep)

17:28.478 --> 17:30.780
MM. I GOTTA GO.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.252
EMS NEEDS ME.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.683
WHAT ABOUT THE--
 OH, ALL THIS?

17:33.683 --> 17:36.256
OH, WE CAN
ATTACK IT TOMORROW. SEE YA.

17:38.388 --> 17:39.759
LET ME GUESS.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.292
THE GRAYSONS FOUND
THE LINDBERGH BABY.

17:42.292 --> 17:43.663
WHAT?

17:43.663 --> 17:46.366
THE 10:00 NEWS.
I COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR.

17:46.366 --> 17:50.440
OH, THAT WAS NOTHING.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.773
I GOT A HEADLINE.

17:53.773 --> 17:57.707
WE TOOK THE PATERNITY TEST,
AND IT'S OFFICIAL. I'M...

17:57.707 --> 17:59.649
I'M GONNA BE A DAD.

17:59.649 --> 18:01.381
I KNOW.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.082
AMANDA TOLD ME.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.415
WE WERE JUST TOGETHER
GOING OVER SOME GODMOTHER STUFF.

18:05.415 --> 18:06.516
HMM.

18:06.516 --> 18:08.618
(sighs) CONGRATULATIONS.
 (chuckles)

18:08.618 --> 18:10.520
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.322
THANKS.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.396
(clears throat) SO...

18:16.396 --> 18:20.400
WHAT DO YOU THINK--
YANKEES BLUE OR JETS GREEN?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.132
WELL, I THINK
THAT AMANDA'S PROBABLY

18:22.132 --> 18:23.733
MORE OF A FOOTBALL FAN
THAN A BASEBALL FAN,

18:23.733 --> 18:26.676
BUT... YOU'LL HAVE TO
ASK HER.

18:28.278 --> 18:29.539
I'LL SEE YOU.

18:29.539 --> 18:31.881
EMILY.

18:34.484 --> 18:36.216
JUST, THANK YOU...

18:36.216 --> 18:38.618
FOR AGREEING TO BE
IN THIS KID'S LIFE,

18:38.618 --> 18:41.491
FOR HAVING MY BACK, ALWAYS,

18:41.491 --> 18:44.254
FOR BEING AMANDA'S FRIEND.

18:47.157 --> 18:49.359
IT'S WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.

18:57.767 --> 19:00.740
YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE YOU NEVER LEFT.

19:02.572 --> 19:05.575
YOU ARE NOT WELCOME
IN THIS BEDROOM, CONRAD.

19:05.575 --> 19:07.717
OH, SO THERE ARE LIMITS

19:07.717 --> 19:09.479
ON HOW FAR
YOU'RE WILLING TO GO

19:09.479 --> 19:11.521
WITH THIS CHARADE.

19:11.521 --> 19:13.583
(chuckles)

19:13.583 --> 19:16.386
YOU RUFFLED A VIOLENT MAN

19:16.386 --> 19:17.757
WHEN YOU PULLED OFF
YOUR DOUBLE CROSS.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.759
AREN'T YOU
THE TINIEST BIT AFRAID

19:19.759 --> 19:22.692
THAT HE MIGHT COME FOR YOU?

19:22.692 --> 19:27.437
OR PERHAPS YOU AND HE
ARE WORKING TOGETHER EVEN NOW.

19:27.437 --> 19:28.698
TO WHAT END?

19:28.698 --> 19:30.740
(chuckling)
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

19:30.740 --> 19:33.673
MY DESTRUCTION.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.545
YOU MAY HAVE
TRUSTED ME ENOUGH

19:35.545 --> 19:37.377
TO HELP WITH
YOUR BOGUS KIDNAPPING STORY.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.709
(whispers) BUT I... DON'T...

19:39.709 --> 19:42.782
TRUST... YOU.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.715
WELL, THAT WON'T BE AN ISSUE
FOR YOU MUCH LONGER, CONRAD.

19:45.715 --> 19:48.518
WE MAY BE QUARANTINED HERE
FOR A WHILE,

19:48.518 --> 19:51.421
BUT COME SUMMER'S END
WHEN THIS STORY RUNS ITS COURSE,

19:51.421 --> 19:53.963
I WILL BE LEAVING YOU
FOR GOOD.

19:55.565 --> 19:57.567
WELL...

19:57.567 --> 20:02.432
SUMMER'S END IS
A LONG WAY OFF, MY DEAR.

20:12.582 --> 20:14.484
(creaks)

20:16.446 --> 20:19.349
EMS?

20:24.324 --> 20:25.755
EMILY?

20:25.755 --> 20:27.427
UHH!

20:27.427 --> 20:28.458
AAH!

20:28.458 --> 20:31.731
(both grunting)

20:31.731 --> 20:33.563
AIDEN!
AIDEN, GET OFF OF HIM!

20:33.563 --> 20:35.805
(groans and coughs)

20:35.805 --> 20:37.767
(Emily) IT'S OKAY.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.008
JUST BREATHE.

20:39.008 --> 20:41.541
(pants) WHY DOES THIS
KEEP HAPPENING TO ME?

20:41.541 --> 20:42.672
WHO IS THAT GUY?

20:42.672 --> 20:43.973
AN ALLY.

20:43.973 --> 20:45.475
NOLAN, WHERE'S THE PHONE?

20:45.475 --> 20:47.417
(sighs)

20:49.949 --> 20:54.484
(whispers)
I TOLD YOU, IT'S EMPTY.

20:54.484 --> 20:55.625
(sighs) LISTEN...

20:55.625 --> 20:56.986
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

20:56.986 --> 20:59.459
COME BACK IN THE MORNING.
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.030
(grunts)

21:01.030 --> 21:02.492
(clatter)

21:04.764 --> 21:05.995
(Nolan) NICE MEETING YOU...

21:05.995 --> 21:07.537
JERK.

21:07.537 --> 21:08.698
(door closes)

21:08.698 --> 21:10.640
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED
TO SEE ME ALIVE?

21:10.640 --> 21:12.642
DEATH BY DUMPSTER
HAD SUCH FLAIR.

21:12.642 --> 21:13.843
SEEMED FITTING.

21:13.843 --> 21:16.676
I FOUND THE FLIGHT RECORDER
FROM VICTORIA'S PLANE.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.908
I THOUGHT WE COULD
MAKE A TRADE.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:18.908 --> 21:22.552
EVERYTHING THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN
HAD ON HIM WHEN HE DIED.

21:22.552 --> 21:24.414
PLEASE.

21:37.667 --> 21:38.828
(closes panel)

21:42.532 --> 21:45.775
LOOK,
WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING,

21:45.775 --> 21:47.977
I'M NOT THE ENEMY.

21:54.944 --> 21:57.547
(thud)
 I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

21:57.547 --> 22:00.850
THE ONLY THING YOU OWE ME
TONIGHT IS YOUR ABSENCE.

22:00.850 --> 22:03.052
(sighs)
YOU MADE A FOOL OF ME.

22:03.052 --> 22:04.954
THAT WASN'T MY INTENTION.

22:04.954 --> 22:06.556
OKAY? I HAD TO WIN
THAT EXERCISE.

22:06.556 --> 22:07.797
(scoffs)

22:07.797 --> 22:10.029
TAKEDA WOULD NEVER HAVE
LET ME GO IF I HAD FAILED.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.661
GO WHERE?

22:11.661 --> 22:14.364
TAKEDA FOUND MY SISTER.

22:14.364 --> 22:16.005
I LEAVE TONIGHT.

22:16.005 --> 22:17.537
BUT YOU'RE ONLY HALFWAY
THROUGH YOUR TRAINING.

22:17.537 --> 22:18.708
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.570
THIS MIGHT BE
MY LAST CHANCE.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.642
HER LAST CHANCE, SO...

22:22.642 --> 22:24.874
LOOK, I-I WILL
COME BACK FOR YOU.

22:24.874 --> 22:27.116
I-I PROMISE.

22:29.679 --> 22:31.020
AIDEN, WAIT.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.724
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

22:34.724 --> 22:35.685
NO. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

22:35.685 --> 22:39.128
EXACTLY.
I'VE ALREADY LOST EVERYTHING.

22:39.128 --> 22:41.731
I'M NOT LOSING YOU, TOO.

22:50.570 --> 22:54.043
MEET ME IN THE MAZE
AT MIDNIGHT.

22:56.846 --> 22:58.448
(sighs)

23:02.812 --> 23:05.685
JUST BECAUSE YOU FAILED
TO SAVE YOUR SISTER

23:05.685 --> 23:07.086
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I'M GONNA FAIL

23:07.086 --> 23:08.658
AT FINDING MY MOTHER.

23:08.658 --> 23:10.820
IT'S NOT WHETHER
YOU FIND HER OR NOT

23:10.820 --> 23:12.592
THAT YOU
SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.496
IT'S WHAT YOU'LL FIND
WHEN YOU DO.

23:19.429 --> 23:21.070
GOOD-BYE, AIDEN.

23:52.732 --> 23:56.636
(rattling)

24:02.512 --> 24:05.444
ANY IDEA WHERE YOU'LL GO?

24:05.444 --> 24:08.047
I DECLINE TO ANSWER
AS I HAPPEN TO LIKE MY NECK

24:08.047 --> 24:10.720
WILLOWY AND WORKING.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.022
WHO THE HELL WAS THAT GUY
LAST NIGHT?

24:13.022 --> 24:15.725
THE LESS YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM,
THE BETTER.

24:15.725 --> 24:17.987
RIGHT.

24:17.987 --> 24:19.228
I'M GONNA
MISS YOU, TOO, EMS.

24:19.228 --> 24:21.561
NOLAN.

24:23.893 --> 24:25.635
THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN
IS DEAD.

24:31.701 --> 24:33.773
HIS NAME WAS...

24:33.773 --> 24:37.006
GORDON MURPHY.

24:37.006 --> 24:41.010
HE HAD A BOTTLE OF PILLS
ON HIM...

24:41.010 --> 24:43.713
FLUPHENAZINE, AN ANTIPSYCHOTIC,
ONE OF THE STRONGEST.

24:43.713 --> 24:46.485
WELL, THAT FITS.
HE WAS A CRAZY KILLER.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.658
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A KILLER,
BUT HE WASN'T CRAZY.

24:50.259 --> 24:52.792
I THINK THE PILLS

24:52.792 --> 24:54.794
BELONGED TO MY MOTHER.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.766
THAT'S A BIT OF A LEAP,
DON'T YOU THINK?

24:56.766 --> 24:58.698
NO, BUT I FOUND THIS
ON HIM.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.806
HE KNEW HER...

25:06.806 --> 25:09.739
INTIMATELY.

25:09.739 --> 25:12.141
HOW CAN I HELP?

25:13.883 --> 25:15.044
(pocket watch snaps shut)

25:15.044 --> 25:16.786
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE ENOUGH.

25:18.217 --> 25:21.751
ONE DAY I WILL FIND A WAY
TO THANK YOU.

25:22.852 --> 25:24.193
WELL...

25:24.193 --> 25:25.955
FIND HER.

25:27.697 --> 25:29.859
THAT'LL BE THANKS ENOUGH.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.674
(bell clanks in distance)

25:46.676 --> 25:47.847
(door opens)

25:47.847 --> 25:50.580
(gasps) WHOA, SAILOR.
YOU SCARED ME.

25:50.580 --> 25:54.684
I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT, UM,
FILING FOR PLUMBING PERMITS.

25:54.684 --> 25:57.056
I WAS. I JUST, UH, I JUST
FORGOT SOME PAPERWORK.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.058
YOU LOOK NICE.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.760
I'M WEARING A TENT.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.861
SHUT UP.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.593
YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

26:03.593 --> 26:05.765
WHERE YOU GOING
ALL DRESSED UP?

26:05.765 --> 26:10.069
EMILY IS TAKING ME SHOPPING
FOR, UM, A CHANGING TABLE

26:10.069 --> 26:11.971
AND A DIAPER PAIL.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.302
WITHOUT ME?

26:13.302 --> 26:14.674
REALLY?

26:14.674 --> 26:15.845
NO, NOT REALLY.

26:15.845 --> 26:16.976
THANK YOU FOR NOT INCLUDING ME,
ACTUALLY.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.649
I MEAN THAT SINCERELY.
THANK EMILY FOR ME, TOO.

26:19.649 --> 26:21.811
ALTHOUGH I FEEL LIKE THAT'S
ALL I'VE BEEN DOING LATELY.

26:21.811 --> 26:24.113
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

26:24.113 --> 26:27.086
JUST THAT SHE'S GENEROUS
TO A FAULT.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.790
RIGHT.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.793
SO, UM, I'LL BE BACK SOON.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.625
OKAY.

26:35.625 --> 26:38.297
HAVE FUN.

26:48.908 --> 26:49.879
OH, NO, NO, I'M SORRY.

26:49.879 --> 26:51.210
WE'VE GOT A LOT
OF CONSTRUCTION GOING ON.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.112
WE SHOULD BE OPEN
INSIDE OF A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.945
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A DRINK.

26:55.945 --> 26:59.188
YOU KNOW THIS KID?

26:59.188 --> 27:00.750
YEAH.

27:00.750 --> 27:01.921
THAT'S MY BROTHER.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.222
OH.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.794
WELL, WE NEED TO TALK.

27:07.096 --> 27:08.858
EMILY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

27:08.858 --> 27:11.630
I'M NOT STAYING. A PRESS VAN'S
BLOCKING THE DRIVEWAY.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.762
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

27:12.762 --> 27:14.363
WE ARE MINUTES AWAY
FROM STARTING.

27:14.363 --> 27:15.865
YOU IN A HURRY?

27:17.036 --> 27:18.808
NO. NO.

27:18.808 --> 27:20.109
BUT, UH, MR. KNOWLES
ACROSS THE STREET

27:20.109 --> 27:21.640
ISN'T SO UNDERSTANDING.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.142
I BEGGED HIM TO HOLD OFF
CALLING THE POLICE

27:23.142 --> 27:24.844
UNTIL I SPOKE WITH YOU,
BUT...

27:24.844 --> 27:26.876
THANKS. I'M ON IT.

27:26.876 --> 27:29.218
EVE!

27:29.218 --> 27:32.682
YOU DON'T WANT TO STICK AROUND
FOR THE MAIN EVENT?

27:32.682 --> 27:36.085
YOUR MOTHER ASKED ME
TO STEER CLEAR OF YOUR FAMILY.

27:36.085 --> 27:38.928
I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WAS
SPEAKING FOR YOU.

27:38.928 --> 27:41.260
SHE WASN'T.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.933
MR. GRAYSON,
THIS ARRIVED AT THE GATE.

27:43.933 --> 27:45.064
WHO SENT IT?

27:45.064 --> 27:47.066
DON'T KNOW, SIR. IT CAME
DURING A SHIFT CHANGE.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.437
THANK YOU.

27:54.303 --> 27:55.805
"VERONICA CLARKE."

27:57.807 --> 27:59.048
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

27:59.048 --> 28:00.209
WHAT IS IT?

28:00.209 --> 28:01.811
CONFIRMATION.

28:01.811 --> 28:03.082
OF WHAT?

28:03.082 --> 28:06.185
EVERY TERRIBLE THOUGHT
I'VE EVER HAD ABOUT MY MOTHER.

28:14.794 --> 28:18.267
OKAY, I'M HERE.
WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

28:18.267 --> 28:20.269
I WANT YOU TO MEET
MR. RYAN.

28:20.269 --> 28:22.371
SOMEONE BROKE INTO HIS PLACE
THE OTHER NIGHT,

28:22.371 --> 28:24.473
AND THEY WERE DUMB ENOUGH
TO LEAVE THIS BEHIND.

28:24.473 --> 28:26.205
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

28:26.205 --> 28:28.908
I-I W--UM, I WASN'T.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.180
I SAW TWO KIDS RUNNING AWAY
FROM MY PROPERTY.

28:31.180 --> 28:32.742
WHO WAS WITH YOU?

28:32.742 --> 28:34.013
NO ONE.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.916
YOU STEAL FROM ME,
THEN CALL ME A LIAR?

28:36.916 --> 28:39.448
NO, SIR, BUT LIKE I SAID,
IT WAS JUST ME.

28:39.448 --> 28:40.890
(Jack) I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.391
WE LOST OUR DAD LAST YEAR,
BUT I SWEAR,

28:42.391 --> 28:43.893
THIS ISN'T
THE WAY HE RAISED US.

28:43.893 --> 28:46.856
WE CAN MEET YOU
DOWN AT THE POLICE STATION.

28:46.856 --> 28:48.357
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

28:48.357 --> 28:50.099
IF THE KID GIVES BACK
WHAT HE TOOK,

28:50.099 --> 28:51.761
I WON'T PRESS CHARGES.

28:51.761 --> 28:54.733
I WAS YOUNG
AND STUPID ONCE, TOO.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.865
CAREFUL, THOUGH.

28:55.865 --> 28:57.807
YOUR NEXT MARK
MIGHT NOT BE SO NICE.

28:57.807 --> 28:59.508
YOU COME BY MY PLACE
TOMORROW?

28:59.508 --> 29:00.840
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.011
HE'LL BE THERE.

29:02.011 --> 29:03.342
THANK YOU.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.844
LISTEN, IF THERE'S EVER
ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU,

29:04.844 --> 29:08.447
YOU JUST--JUST LET ME KNOW.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.780
YOU KNOW WHAT, BARKEEP?

29:10.780 --> 29:14.784
I'M GONNA HOLD YOU
TO THAT.

29:19.228 --> 29:21.160
NICE GOING.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.838
HEY.

29:28.838 --> 29:29.869
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.140
AMANDA.

29:33.002 --> 29:34.343
HOW DID YOU GET UP HERE?

29:34.343 --> 29:36.806
A SISTER HAS HER WAYS.

29:36.806 --> 29:38.948
MY MOTHER WILL FREAK
IF SHE KNOWS YOU'RE UP HERE.

29:38.948 --> 29:40.779
NOT A BIG FAN OF SURPRISES.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.852
I'M NOT AFRAID OF HER.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE EITHER.

29:42.852 --> 29:44.183
I'M NOT.

29:44.183 --> 29:47.556
GOOD, 'CAUSE IF
WE'RE GONNA GET CLOSER,

29:47.556 --> 29:50.920
I-I CAN'T PROTECT HER
ANYMORE.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.321
WHAT IS THIS?

29:52.321 --> 29:54.924
A JOURNAL OUR FATHER KEPT
IN PRISON.

29:54.924 --> 29:56.065
I MARKED THE ENTRIES

29:56.065 --> 29:59.028
THAT I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD READ FIRST.

29:59.028 --> 30:00.930
BUT I HAVE TO WARN YOU,

30:00.930 --> 30:03.202
WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER ISN'T PRETTY.

30:05.574 --> 30:08.807
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE FEAR
YOU MUST HAVE FELT--

30:08.807 --> 30:10.880
EIGHT WEEKS OF TORTURE?
 MM-HMM.

30:10.880 --> 30:14.443
TELL ME, DID YOU EVER
HAVE A MOMENT

30:14.443 --> 30:16.815
WHERE YOU FELT LIKE
GIVING UP?

30:16.815 --> 30:19.218
NO.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.990
THE THOUGHT OF NEVER SEEING
MY CHILDREN AGAIN

30:20.990 --> 30:22.952
WAS FAR WORSE
THAN ANYTHING MY CAPTOR

30:22.952 --> 30:25.254
COULD HAVE EVER DONE TO ME.

30:25.254 --> 30:28.127
YOU CAN CALL IT
A MOTHER'S WILL TO SURVIVE.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.900
(Charlotte)
MORE LIKE A MONSTER'S.

30:30.900 --> 30:32.401
I JUST FOUND OUT
THE REAL REASON

30:32.401 --> 30:34.934
YOU DON'T WANT ME HAVING
A RELATIONSHIP WITH AMANDA.

30:34.934 --> 30:38.267
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID TO MY FATHER.

30:38.267 --> 30:39.608
CHARLOTTE,
THIS IS NOT THE TIME.

30:39.608 --> 30:41.010
WHO, FOR THE RECORD,

30:41.010 --> 30:42.471
WAS DAVID CLARKE.

30:42.471 --> 30:44.043
YOU RUN THAT,

30:44.043 --> 30:45.975
AND I WILL SUE YOU
FOR LIBEL.

30:45.975 --> 30:48.417
IT'S ONLY LIBEL
IF IT ISN'T TRUE.

30:48.417 --> 30:50.419
GO AHEAD, MOM. DENY IT.

30:54.383 --> 30:56.325
(voice breaks)
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

30:56.325 --> 30:57.927
THIS INTERVIEW'S OVER.

30:59.558 --> 31:00.960
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

31:00.960 --> 31:03.993
MOM WASN'T KIDNAPPED.
SHE WAS PLANNING TO DISAPPEAR.

31:06.535 --> 31:07.897
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

31:07.897 --> 31:08.867
SOMEONE DROPPED IT
AT THE GUARD HOUSE

31:08.867 --> 31:09.999
ALONG WITH THAT NOTE.

31:09.999 --> 31:11.870
SHE WAS
WORKING WITH HIM, DAD.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.342
NO, OPEN THREATS ARE NOT
THIS MAN'S STYLE.

31:13.342 --> 31:15.204
IF HE TRULY WANTED HER DEAD,
THEN SHE WOULD BE.

31:15.204 --> 31:17.106
NO, YOU'RE MISSING
THE LARGER REVELATION HERE.

31:17.106 --> 31:19.408
MOM FAKED
HER OWN KIDNAPPING.

31:19.408 --> 31:21.250
MY BOY, AT THIS MOMENT,
THERE ARE THINGS AT PLAY

31:21.250 --> 31:23.652
THAT DWARF YOUR PENCHANT
FOR GULLIBILITY.

31:23.652 --> 31:25.054
WAIT.

31:25.054 --> 31:26.515
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

31:26.515 --> 31:28.017
CHARLOTTE, WAIT.

31:28.017 --> 31:31.490
HEY, BOTH OF YOU,
GET IN HERE NOW.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.022
NOW!

31:37.426 --> 31:40.269
YOU SELFISH,
MANIPULATIVE LIAR.

31:40.269 --> 31:41.600
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

31:41.600 --> 31:42.972
WHERE DO YOU THINK?

31:42.972 --> 31:44.533
DANIEL, THIS SECRET
WAS KILLING ME.

31:44.533 --> 31:45.904
I BEGGED HER TO TELL YOU.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.206
YOU KNEW, TOO?

31:47.206 --> 31:49.038
DON'T BLAME HER.
I CAN EXPLAIN.

31:49.038 --> 31:50.439
OH, WITH WHAT, MORE LIES?

31:50.439 --> 31:51.610
YOU SHOULD BE BEGGING
FOR MY FORGIVENESS

31:51.610 --> 31:53.112
AFTER PULLING
A SCAM LIKE THIS.

31:53.112 --> 31:56.015
YOU SHOULD BE BEGGING
FOR MY FORGIVENESS, DEAR SON.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.117
I HANDED YOU PROOF
OF CONRAD'S GUILT,

31:58.117 --> 32:01.420
AND YOU CHOSE HIS LIES
OVER THE TRUTH.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.023
AND THE BLOOD OF EVERY PERSON
ON THAT GOVERNMENT PLANE

32:04.023 --> 32:05.654
IS ON YOUR HANDS
AS WELL AS HIS.

32:05.654 --> 32:07.196
CHARLOTTE, WHATEVER YOUR
MOTHER'S BEEN TELLING YOU,

32:07.196 --> 32:08.357
PAY NO ATTENTION.

32:08.357 --> 32:10.529
SHE'S CLEARLY
NOT IN HER RIGHT MIND.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.402
AND WE ARE CANCELING
THIS SHAM OF AN EVENT.

32:13.402 --> 32:14.703
DO THAT,

32:14.703 --> 32:17.006
AND I WILL HAVE
YOUR HEAD ON A PIKE.

32:17.006 --> 32:19.138
YOU KNOW, AS FINE AS I AM WITH
A HIRED KILLER TARGETING YOU,

32:19.138 --> 32:21.140
HE WON'T STOP THERE,
VICTORIA.

32:21.140 --> 32:24.043
WE'RE LEAVING THE COUNTRY
TONIGHT, ALL OF US.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.514
NO,
I'M THROUGH WITH HIDING.

32:25.514 --> 32:27.146
I'M GOING TO PUT
A STOP TO THIS RIGHT NOW,

32:27.146 --> 32:29.318
COME WHAT MAY.

32:33.082 --> 32:37.026
(indistinct conversations)

32:42.031 --> 32:44.333
I AM SO SORRY
FOR ALL THE HELL

32:44.333 --> 32:46.465
MY MOTHER PUT YOU THROUGH
WHILE WE WERE TOGETHER.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.997
NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND

32:47.997 --> 32:49.538
WOULD CHOOSE
TO LIVE INSIDE THIS FAMILY.

32:49.538 --> 32:51.070
I DESPISE HER.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.742
WORD OF ADVICE.

32:53.742 --> 32:55.404
KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

32:55.404 --> 32:57.106
THE ONLY WAY
TO BEAT YOUR MOTHER

32:57.106 --> 32:59.478
IS TO PLAY HER GAME
BETTER THAN SHE DOES.

33:02.011 --> 33:04.483
(Ashley) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.985
WE'RE ABOUT TO BEGIN,
AND PLEASE...

33:06.985 --> 33:08.317
AMANDA, WAIT.

33:08.317 --> 33:10.119
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:10.119 --> 33:11.460
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BANNED
FROM THE PREMISES.

33:11.460 --> 33:12.991
I WAS.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.123
I AM.

33:14.123 --> 33:17.296
BUT I'M STAYING FOR THIS,
AND SO ARE YOU.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.997
NO. I ALREADY DID
WHAT YOU ASKED.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.769
JACK WOULD KILL ME
IF HE KNEW I WAS HERE.

33:20.769 --> 33:22.131
AND JACK WOULD KILL YOU
IF HE KNEW

33:22.131 --> 33:23.272
THAT BABY YOU'RE CARRYING
ISN'T HIS.

33:23.272 --> 33:24.433
(sighs)

33:24.433 --> 33:26.175
THIS IS
THAT IMPORTANT TO ME.

33:26.175 --> 33:29.138
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

33:30.439 --> 33:31.780
(Victoria, amplified voice)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

33:31.780 --> 33:33.682
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY MOTTO

33:33.682 --> 33:36.315
THAT FROM BAD COMES GOOD.
 (camera shutters clicking)

33:36.315 --> 33:39.288
SO TONIGHT THERE WILL BE
NO REHASHING OF THE PAST--

33:39.288 --> 33:41.620
ONLY MY ASPIRATIONS
FOR THE FUTURE.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.752
VIOLENCE TO ONE

33:43.752 --> 33:46.455
IS VIOLENCE TO ALL.

33:46.455 --> 33:48.527
AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE CLOSE TO ME

33:48.527 --> 33:51.100
WHO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED
BY THIS TRAGEDY.

33:51.100 --> 33:52.561
SHE'S GONE OFF BOOK.
SHE'S GOING TO TANK.

33:52.561 --> 33:54.433
FIRST...
 I DOUBT THAT VERY MUCH.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.235
MY DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE.

33:56.235 --> 33:58.737
DURING MY CONFINEMENT,
I PROMISED GOD

33:58.737 --> 34:02.040
THAT IF GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE,
I WOULD LIVE IN TRUTH.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.043
AND THIS STARTS WITH THE BIGGEST
ADMISSION OF MY LIFE.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.546
(camera shutters clicking)

34:07.546 --> 34:09.217
CHARLOTTE...

34:09.217 --> 34:13.252
IS THE BLESSED CONSEQUENCE
OF MY AFFAIR WITH DAVID CLARKE.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.623
(reporters gasping
and murmuring)

34:15.623 --> 34:17.826
SWEETHEART,
WOULD YOU STEP UP HERE, PLEASE?

34:17.826 --> 34:21.090
(murmuring continues)

34:21.090 --> 34:25.333
(camera shutters clicking)

34:27.835 --> 34:30.268
(cell phone rings)

34:30.268 --> 34:32.201
(ring, beep)

34:32.201 --> 34:33.371
YES.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.703
(woman)
Conrad, you're a smart man,

34:34.703 --> 34:36.505
so I know
you've been expecting this call.

34:36.505 --> 34:38.476
Your wife's
very public accusations

34:38.476 --> 34:40.309
about our agent's
alleged transgression

34:40.309 --> 34:42.380
has us all deeply concerned.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.152
A course of action
has been decided,

34:44.152 --> 34:45.284
and it involves
your participation.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.585
NEXT,
TO THE SAINT AMONG MEN...

34:47.585 --> 34:48.757
We'll be in touch.

34:48.757 --> 34:50.119
WHO FORGAVE MY INFIDELITY

34:50.119 --> 34:51.690
AND CHERISHED CHARLOTTE
AS HIS OWN--

34:51.690 --> 34:54.163
CONRAD, COME.

34:54.163 --> 34:57.166
(camera shutters clicking,
reporters continue murmuring)

35:02.201 --> 35:04.803
AND FINALLY, MY SON DANIEL,

35:04.803 --> 35:07.676
WHOSE LOYALTY KNOWS NO BOUNDS.

35:15.484 --> 35:19.488
(camera shutters clicking,
reporters continue murmuring)

35:23.152 --> 35:24.693
THERE IS ONE PERSON MISSING--

35:24.693 --> 35:28.157
SOMEONE WHO HAS SEEN MORE BAD
THAN GOOD FROM US,

35:28.157 --> 35:30.128
AND WHO HAS
NEVER BEEN SCARED OFF.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.730
HER TENACITY I ADMIRE,

35:31.730 --> 35:35.204
AND I WISH TO WELCOME HER
INTO THE FOLD...

35:35.204 --> 35:38.167
ALONG WITH HER CHILD--
AMANDA CLARKE,

35:38.167 --> 35:39.808
CHARLOTTE'S HALF SISTER.

35:39.808 --> 35:41.240
(reporters murmuring)

35:41.240 --> 35:44.473
AMANDA, PLEASE JOIN US.

35:44.473 --> 35:46.915
(reporters continue murmuring)

35:46.915 --> 35:48.177
(Victoria) PLEASE.

35:50.779 --> 35:55.484
(camera shutters clicking)

35:59.788 --> 36:01.590
TO MY ABDUCTOR AND TO ANYONE

36:01.590 --> 36:04.162
WHO THINKS THEY CAN HARM
THIS FAMILY AGAIN,

36:04.162 --> 36:07.296
MAKE NO MISTAKE, YOU WILL FAIL.

36:07.296 --> 36:08.797
(man) MRS. GRAYSON!
 (reporters shouting questions
at once)

36:08.797 --> 36:10.939
(lowered voice) UNDERSTOOD?
 (woman) EXCUSE ME.

36:10.939 --> 36:13.272
(Victoria, amplified voice) THIS
CONCLUDES THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.773
AS THIS IS
AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION,

36:14.773 --> 36:16.575
THERE WILL BE
NO QUESTIONS TONIGHT.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.277
(reporters)
VICTORIA! VICTORIA!

36:18.277 --> 36:19.408
MY GOD,
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN EVER.

36:19.408 --> 36:22.451
(reporters shout indistinctly)

36:30.259 --> 36:32.221
MOM.

36:32.221 --> 36:35.394
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SHOW
OF SOLIDARITY TONIGHT.

36:35.394 --> 36:38.367
YOUR PERFORMANCE
WAS FLAWLESS.

36:38.367 --> 36:40.699
I WASN'T PERFORMING.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.371
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D HATE MYSELF

36:42.371 --> 36:45.274
IF I'D GOTTEN YOU BACK
ONLY TO LOSE YOU AGAIN.

36:45.274 --> 36:47.776
I'M WILLING TO PUT THIS
ALL BEHIND US IF YOU ARE.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.641
COME HERE.

36:52.641 --> 36:54.943
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

36:54.943 --> 36:56.515
(woman laughs)

36:56.515 --> 36:59.418
OH, WHAT A LOVELY TABLEAU--

36:59.418 --> 37:02.421
MOTHER AND SON REUNITED.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.793
EXCUSE ME. I'M GONNA
CHECK ON ASHLEY.

37:04.793 --> 37:07.756
MS. FISK, MY APOLOGIES
IF TODAY'S EVENT

37:07.756 --> 37:09.227
RUINED OUR INTERVIEW.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.899
ACTUALLY,
CONRAD JUST MADE UP FOR IT

37:10.899 --> 37:14.232
BY OFFERING ME AN EXCLUSIVE
ON YOUR UPCOMING WEDDING.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.906
I'M SORRY IF I SPILLED
THE PROVERBIAL BEANS, MY PET.

37:17.906 --> 37:20.238
I MEAN, I JUST--
I THINK I JUST GOT CAUGHT UP

37:20.238 --> 37:23.342
IN THE WHOLE... AFFAIR.
 (chuckles)

37:23.342 --> 37:24.713
AND TUSCANY?

37:24.713 --> 37:28.847
AN EXQUISITE PLACE TO HONEYMOON.
I'D EXPECT NOTHING LESS.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.779
THANK YOU BOTH.
GOOD NIGHT.

37:30.779 --> 37:31.950
GOOD NIGHT.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.323
(footsteps retreat, door opens)

37:34.323 --> 37:36.325
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IT
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

37:36.325 --> 37:38.427
FOR PUBLICLY BRANDING ME
A CUCKOLD.
 (door closes)

37:38.427 --> 37:39.958
I SO LOOK FORWARD

37:39.958 --> 37:42.731
TO YOU RESUMING
YOUR WIFELY DUTIES, DEAR.

37:42.731 --> 37:44.032
OH, WELL, IF THAT THREAT
HAS ANY MERIT,

37:44.032 --> 37:45.734
YOU AND I WILL BE DEAD
BEFORE THEN.

37:45.734 --> 37:47.366
OH, I WOULDN'T BET
ON THAT.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.339
SEE, I'VE GOT SOME
BREAKING NEWS OF MY OWN.

37:50.339 --> 37:52.301
WHILE YOU WERE DAZZLING
THE PRESS CORPS,

37:52.301 --> 37:55.904
I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM YOUR
WOULD-BE ASSASSIN'S EMPLOYERS.

37:55.904 --> 37:58.707
IT TURNS OUT
THAT HIS RECENT, UH, ROGUE

37:58.707 --> 38:03.281
AND HIGH-PROFILE ESCAPADES
HAVE MADE HIM A TARGET NOW.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.955
SO HE'S AS GOOD AS DEAD,
SO LONG AS WE COOPERATE.

38:06.955 --> 38:08.957
OH, YOU FOOL.

38:08.957 --> 38:10.459
YOU'VE JUST PUT US
BACK IN BED

38:10.459 --> 38:13.622
WITH THE VERY ARCHITECTS
OF THIS ENTIRE NIGHTMARE.

38:13.622 --> 38:15.594
(chuckles) OH, VICTORIA.

38:15.594 --> 38:19.628
THIS FAMILY HAS YOU
 TO THANK FOR THAT.

38:21.870 --> 38:24.333
(bell clangs in distance)

38:29.077 --> 38:31.309
JACK?

38:31.309 --> 38:32.681
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

38:35.083 --> 38:37.746
YOU AND YOUR NEW FAMILY
WERE ALL OVER THE NEWS.

38:37.746 --> 38:39.317
DID YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T SEE IT?

38:39.317 --> 38:40.649
I CAN EXPLAIN.

38:40.649 --> 38:42.090
IT'S BETTER IF I DO THAT.

38:43.852 --> 38:45.394
MY BROTHER
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON

38:45.394 --> 38:46.525
IN MY LIFE TO ME,

38:46.525 --> 38:48.827
SO I GET
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BUILD

38:48.827 --> 38:50.559
A RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR SISTER.

38:50.559 --> 38:52.100
THAT'S EXACTLY IT, JACK.

38:52.100 --> 38:54.102
CHARLOTTE BEGGED ME
TO BE THERE.

38:54.102 --> 38:55.604
AND IF DECLAN NEEDED ME,

38:55.604 --> 38:57.906
I WOULD DROP EVERYTHING
TO BE THERE FOR HIM, TOO.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.070
IT WAS WRONG OF ME
TO TRY TO CONTROL

39:02.070 --> 39:03.942
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE GRAYSONS,

39:03.942 --> 39:06.044
BUT... (sighs)

39:07.946 --> 39:09.448
THIS IS THE LAST TIME

39:09.448 --> 39:12.451
I TAKE OWNERSHIP
FOR YOUR LIES.

39:12.451 --> 39:13.952
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.725
I'M COMMITTED TO OUR CHILD.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.089
I JUST DON'T THINK
I CAN COMMIT TO YOU.

39:25.033 --> 39:27.436
(sniffles)

39:29.768 --> 39:31.099
YOU WERE RIGHT.

39:31.099 --> 39:32.771
IT'S NO GOOD.

39:32.771 --> 39:35.844
ANY CONTACTS THAT COULD'VE
LED ME TO THE INITIATIVE

39:35.844 --> 39:37.976
WERE DESTROYED
WITH THAT BULLET, SO I...

39:37.976 --> 39:39.107
HAD TO GO TO PLAN "B."

39:39.107 --> 39:41.410
YOU SENT THE PASSPORT TO
THE GRAYSONS TO MAKE THEM THINK

39:41.410 --> 39:43.412
THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN
WAS COMING FOR THEM.

39:43.412 --> 39:44.513
AND IT WORKED.

39:44.513 --> 39:47.486
CONRAD AND THE INITIATIVE
ARE ALREADY IN CONTACT.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.418
I HAD MY OWN PLAN.

39:49.418 --> 39:51.159
YOU COULD'VE
DESTROYED EVERYTHING.

39:51.159 --> 39:53.722
BUT I DIDN'T, DID I?

39:53.722 --> 39:55.894
AMANDA CLARKE IS EMBEDDED
IN THAT FAMILY,

39:55.894 --> 39:58.396
AND DANIEL GRAYSON
IS OUT TO RUIN HIS MOTHER.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.900
BETTER STILL,
HE TRUSTS YOU AGAIN.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.632
YOU WERE AT THE HOUSE.

40:03.632 --> 40:04.973
(chuckles)

40:04.973 --> 40:07.175
OH, IT WAS FANTASTIC
WATCHING YOU CAPITALIZE

40:07.175 --> 40:10.008
ON THE SERENDIPITY
OF MY ACTIONS.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.841
STOP ACTING LIKE YOU HAVE
MY BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.

40:12.841 --> 40:16.815
OUR INTERESTS USED TO BE
ONE AND THE SAME.

40:20.088 --> 40:23.091
(wind whistling)

40:26.424 --> 40:28.196
AIDEN?

40:28.196 --> 40:30.158
HE'S GONE.

40:32.030 --> 40:35.433
YOUR LOVER
HAS LEFT YOU BEHIND.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.065
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

40:37.065 --> 40:38.907
SURELY FAILURE
WILL GREET HIM.

40:38.907 --> 40:41.069
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

40:41.069 --> 40:43.111
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR TESTS.

40:43.111 --> 40:45.914
NO. NO TEST.

40:45.914 --> 40:48.016
WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT
OR NOT,

40:48.016 --> 40:50.519
HE CHOSE TO LEAVE YOU
JUST THE SAME.

40:52.481 --> 40:53.782
HOW DOES IT FEEL

40:53.782 --> 40:55.624
TO HAVE OPENED YOURSELF
TO BETRAYAL,

40:55.624 --> 40:58.456
SAME AS YOUR FATHER?

40:58.456 --> 41:00.989
IF YOU WANT TO SUCCEED
IN YOUR GOAL,

41:00.989 --> 41:03.892
YOU MUST LEARN
TO CLOSE YOUR HEART.

41:03.892 --> 41:06.795
THE YOUNG MAN YOU TRUSTED
UNDERSTOOD.

41:06.795 --> 41:09.638
YET, STILL...

41:09.638 --> 41:12.140
YOU DO NOT.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.107
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

41:19.107 --> 41:21.049
HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO SAY I'M SORRY

41:21.049 --> 41:23.481
BEFORE YOU'LL TRUST ME
AGAIN?

41:34.563 --> 41:35.924
(clatter)

41:45.534 --> 41:47.005
(electronic female voice)
You have one unheard message.

41:47.005 --> 41:50.809
To listen to your messages,
press 1.

41:51.780 --> 41:53.542
(beep)

41:53.542 --> 41:57.085
(Kara) Gordon, it's me.
Where are you?

41:57.085 --> 42:00.088
Um, some guy claiming to be
a Detective Lasky

42:00.088 --> 42:03.521
came by with a-a sketch,
asking questions.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.293
I-I know
what I'm supposed to do,

42:05.293 --> 42:06.995
and if I don't hear from you
by tomorrow,

42:06.995 --> 42:08.627
I'll--I'll start
shutting everything down

42:08.627 --> 42:12.060
and go dark like we promised.

42:12.060 --> 42:14.763
Only I'm hoping
I won't have to,

42:14.763 --> 42:16.865
that somehow
you're still okay.

42:16.865 --> 42:20.008
God, Gordon, please be okay.

42:20.008 --> 42:21.710
I love you.
