<i>Previously on</i> NYPD Blue:

00:03.933 --> 00:06.322
I won't talk about
my personal feelings at this point.

- While the case is going on.
- While the case is going on.

00:08.573 --> 00:11.724
Would it better if instead of seeing him
carry a bag, it was a gun?

00:11.933 --> 00:14.970
If she's psycho, I don't want you in a
position where she can lie about you.

00:15.173 --> 00:17.084
- Mike Roberts. How you doing?
- Bobby Simone.

00:17.253 --> 00:18.971
SIPOWICZ:
Roberts used to be on the job here.

00:19.173 --> 00:22.688
Oh, Andy. An Orthodox wedding
is so beautiful.

00:22.893 --> 00:25.168
Each of us gets to wear a crown
of white flowers.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.729
- Simone. I'll be working with you.
- Diane Russell. Where can I change?

00:28.893 --> 00:30.884
Locker room's right over there.

00:32.973 --> 00:36.363
Isn't this one of those things we swear
to ourselves we're going to avoid?

00:36.533 --> 00:38.763
Yeah. Let's do it anyway.

00:38.973 --> 00:42.090
We're here alone.
I won't tell if you won't.

00:42.293 --> 00:45.171
- We can't do this, Joyce.
- Why? Don't think you can trust me?

00:45.373 --> 00:48.046
- No, it's not that.
- You think I'd get you into trouble?

00:48.253 --> 00:51.325
Accuse you of something
if you didn't do what I wanted?

01:15.933 --> 01:18.003
- Where's Andy?
- I don't know.

01:18.213 --> 01:20.568
- He left right after us.
- What do we got?

01:20.773 --> 01:24.766
Busboy found him dumped here
when he came out for a smoke.

01:25.373 --> 01:28.126
SIMONE: One in the temple.
- Any ID on him?

01:28.293 --> 01:31.012
No ID, no cash.
I know this guy though.

01:31.173 --> 01:33.164
His name's Lenny Wiley.
He's a bookie.

01:33.413 --> 01:36.644
Bar around the corner's one
of his hangouts. I know some others.

01:36.853 --> 01:40.766
- We got the same beat.
- All right, we start over there.

01:40.933 --> 01:42.446
Thanks a lot.

01:44.333 --> 01:45.925
OFFICER:
Should we cover him?

01:53.573 --> 01:56.007
- I'm gonna take a look back here.
SIMONE: All right.

01:57.133 --> 01:59.089
- You know Lenny Wiley?
BARTENDER: Yeah, he comes in.

01:59.293 --> 02:01.329
SIMONE: See him today?
- Yeah, he was in for coffee.

02:01.533 --> 02:02.966
- Was he with anybody?
- No.

02:03.173 --> 02:05.243
What are you asking
about Lenny Wiley for?

02:05.453 --> 02:08.330
Because somebody killed him and
dumped him in the alley.

02:08.493 --> 02:09.562
[DOOR OPENS]

02:10.652 --> 02:11.927
SIMONE: Andy.
- Where you been?

02:12.093 --> 02:15.881
Oh, them night-watch humps. They leave
the car with a flat and no spare.

02:16.053 --> 02:19.841
- I'm gonna start the canvass.
- Cop caught me up.

02:20.053 --> 02:22.692
- Can't believe they killed Lenny.
- Lenny's dead?

02:22.893 --> 02:25.453
- Yeah, dumped him in the alley.
- You know Lenny Wiley?

02:25.613 --> 02:27.683
- Yeah, I know, sure.
- He was a bookmaker, right?

02:27.853 --> 02:29.286
Oh, I don't know about that.

02:29.453 --> 02:30.852
SIPOWICZ:
Hey. Lenny Wiley the bookmaker...

02:31.053 --> 02:34.170
...was murdered and found in the alley.
Now, can you help us with that?

02:34.333 --> 02:36.403
- No, I can't...
- Then shut up and drink your shot.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.406
- So he used to make book in here, right?
- Hey, I mix drinks.

02:39.573 --> 02:42.451
And probably get a C-note a week
for letting him operate here...

02:42.613 --> 02:44.649
...which I'm not interested in.
So cut the crap.

02:44.853 --> 02:47.765
Now what I want to know,
did anybody owe this guy strong money?

02:47.973 --> 02:50.282
- Anybody in trouble with him?
- Not that I know.

02:50.493 --> 02:51.972
SIMONE:
Anybody win big against him...

02:52.133 --> 02:55.682
...where people might've known that
this bookie was holding to pay off?

02:55.853 --> 02:57.764
- No.
- What about Jerry?

02:57.933 --> 02:59.889
SIMONE: Who's Jerry?
BARTENDER: Herbie, use your head.

03:00.093 --> 03:02.891
- Stay out of this.
- I'm an American citizen...

03:03.053 --> 03:06.284
...and a citizen of this borough,
and I was asked a question.

03:06.493 --> 03:07.767
Hey, who's Jerry?

03:07.933 --> 03:10.003
Jerry tapped on the Knicks
last Wednesday.

03:10.213 --> 03:13.125
- Am I right or wrong?
- Jerry Marsh earns a good living.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.164
Jerry Marsh always pays his debts.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.244
Jerry Marsh is not gonna hurt anybody.

03:17.413 --> 03:19.483
- Would you leave Jerry out of this?
- Shut up!

03:19.693 --> 03:21.411
Jerry Marsh ever do me any favors?

03:21.573 --> 03:24.849
The next favor Jerry Marsh does for me
is gonna be favor number one.

03:25.013 --> 03:27.402
- Come here. What's your name?
- Jimmy Sullivan.

03:27.573 --> 03:29.723
Chops Sullivan.
Chops wouldn't hurt a soul.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.571
- Would you shut up?
- No, you shut up!

03:31.733 --> 03:34.486
- Where do we contact Jerry Marsh?
- Keep your mouth shut.

03:34.693 --> 03:37.287
- He didn't have anything to do with it.
- Maybe he didn't.

03:37.453 --> 03:40.047
But maybe Jerry can tell me
when he paid the bookie off...

03:40.213 --> 03:42.204
...and give me something
that I can go on.

03:42.373 --> 03:45.968
Now is that
a satisfactory explanation?!

03:46.133 --> 03:47.013
- Yeah. All right.
- Good, Chops.

03:47.013 --> 03:47.843
- Yeah. All right.
- Good, Chops.

03:48.053 --> 03:50.442
Now you're in the Citizens Auxiliary.

03:50.613 --> 03:54.811
- I can't believe Lenny's dead.
- I owed him 35 bucks.

03:54.973 --> 03:58.761
- I guess I'm ahead for the week.
- Next round's on you then.

Good morning.

05:14.573 --> 05:16.768
- Morning, detective.
- Morning.

05:16.933 --> 05:20.892
- Wade hearing on the Glover case today?
- I know you'll be distressed to hear this.

05:21.053 --> 05:22.406
They've decided to plea.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.251
- Is that right?
COSTAS: First degree man.

05:24.733 --> 05:27.770
You might want to call Miss Novak
and let her know you won't be...

05:27.933 --> 05:30.686
...chaperoning her to the trial.
- I'll use my own quarter.

05:31.773 --> 05:34.924
Everybody, this is
Detective Diane Russell.

05:35.093 --> 05:38.051
She's joining us from OCCB.
She'll be working your slot.

05:38.253 --> 05:40.926
- Here, this is yours.
- Thanks, lieutenant.

05:41.093 --> 05:43.687
So, what'd you get on that dump job?

05:43.853 --> 05:48.131
Leonard Wiley, 55,
multiple PMD collars for bookmaking.

05:48.293 --> 05:51.012
He left one of his hangouts
on foot around 8.

05:51.173 --> 05:54.848
Busboy found him shot in the alley
across the street about an hour later.

05:55.013 --> 05:56.287
FANCY:
But the body was dumped?

05:56.493 --> 05:59.371
You could see skin abrasions,
scuff marks on his clothes.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.411
M.E. Said the car must've been moving
when they pushed him out.

06:02.573 --> 06:05.963
He had a big payday coming in from
a client. We're bringing the client in.

06:06.133 --> 06:09.330
And we heard from some of the bookie's
hangouts that he used a driver.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.046
We're reaching out for him too.

06:11.213 --> 06:14.205
- Know who used to bodyguard this guy?
- Who?

06:14.813 --> 06:17.088
- Mike Roberts.
- You bringing Roberts in?

06:17.293 --> 06:20.763
- We got a call in to him.
- Keep him away from me.

06:22.053 --> 06:23.964
- Andy? Remember...
- Yeah?

06:24.173 --> 06:26.641
...Father Kankarides changed
our appointment to 1:00?

06:27.413 --> 06:31.406
Yeah, that's all right.
Unless, is that bad for you?

06:32.133 --> 06:34.772
- No.
- No, 1 is fine for me.

06:36.893 --> 06:39.691
Detective Sipowicz,
Mike Roberts is on line two.

06:39.893 --> 06:41.246
Yeah.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.891
Yeah, Mike.

06:44.733 --> 06:46.928
- So how's it going?
- Good.

06:47.093 --> 06:49.732
- Glad I'm here.
- I am too. Listen...

06:49.893 --> 06:52.202
...you gonna be all right with this?
- It's fate.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.688
Because you know you can
say something to Fancy.

06:54.893 --> 06:58.090
"I'm sleeping with Simone,
it's better if I'm at another desk"?

06:58.253 --> 06:59.971
Yeah, that's the wrong approach.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.811
- Mike's finding time for us.
- There goes his bingo game.

07:05.373 --> 07:08.413
Andy, did you meet Diane Russell?
She worked on that arson-homicide.

07:08.653 --> 07:10.405
- No. How's it going?
- Hi, Andy.

07:10.613 --> 07:13.491
- They got you at that desk?
- Yeah. Kind of close quarters.

07:13.693 --> 07:17.686
Yeah. They used an old floor plan
from a submarine.

07:18.413 --> 07:20.404
I gotta call that wacko
witness of mine.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.167
Let her know this trial's off.

07:26.773 --> 07:29.207
- Can I help you?
- I'm Donna Abandando.

07:29.413 --> 07:32.803
Miss Abandando. I've heard so much
about you. I'm John Irvin.

07:33.573 --> 07:36.610
Nice to meet you.
Is Lt. Fancy out?

07:36.773 --> 07:40.732
JOHN: He'll be back in a minute.
He just stepped upstairs to Anti-Crime.

07:40.933 --> 07:42.810
Won't you have a seat?

07:44.093 --> 07:46.209
Like you never left.

07:55.373 --> 07:59.332
SIMONE: It's Detective Simone,
Joyce. How's it going? Mm-hm.

08:00.253 --> 08:03.928
Yeah, I just wanted to tell you that
Arnold Glover's agreed to plea.

08:04.093 --> 08:06.243
So there's not gonna be any trial.

08:07.573 --> 08:09.325
Yeah, it is.

08:10.653 --> 08:14.043
Well, I just wanted to let you know that,
and tell you how much we...

08:14.213 --> 08:17.171
...appreciated all your help
on the case. Okay?

08:18.653 --> 08:21.645
No, I really don't know
that many details...

08:23.093 --> 08:24.651
Sure.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.611
Mm-hm.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.886
How about that place across the street
from where you live?

08:32.653 --> 08:37.124
Wait, what's it...? Nina's, right?
Half an hour?

08:37.653 --> 08:40.725
Great. Yeah. Bye.

08:42.133 --> 08:45.409
Dreaming. I was dreaming,
thinking that I'd beat that sit-down.

08:50.853 --> 08:53.083
- Hi, Greg.
- Hi, Donna.

08:53.253 --> 08:56.450
- You look great.
- Relaxed and rejuvenated.

08:56.653 --> 09:01.966
Yeah? That's terrific.
So, what's up now? More vacation?

09:02.733 --> 09:06.043
- No, I'm ready to come back to work.
- Is that so?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.726
Interesting.

09:07.893 --> 09:09.372
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi, lieutenant.

09:09.533 --> 09:11.569
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

09:11.733 --> 09:15.009
Well, I certainly look forward
to seeing you, Donna.

09:16.253 --> 09:18.642
Back in the workplace.

09:20.173 --> 09:22.892
DONNA:
Take care, detective.

09:23.933 --> 09:27.562
- Um, so did you miss me a little bit?
- Yeah, sure we did.

09:27.733 --> 09:30.008
- You ready to come back?
- Can I come back tomorrow?

09:30.213 --> 09:32.010
Tomorrow's fine.
I'll let the temp know.

09:32.173 --> 09:33.891
- Thank you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

09:34.053 --> 09:36.487
- See you tomorrow.
- It's good to see you.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.731
Miss Abandando is lovely.

09:41.893 --> 09:43.565
FANCY:
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

09:43.733 --> 09:45.610
Shall I assume this means
I'm moving on?

09:45.773 --> 09:47.333
Yeah. She's coming back
tomorrow, John.

09:47.333 --> 09:47.571
Yeah. She's coming back
tomorrow, John.

09:47.733 --> 09:51.169
- Fine. I'll let the temp pool know.
- Okay.

10:03.413 --> 10:06.610
Jerry Marsh to see
Detective Sipowicz or Simone.

10:07.493 --> 10:10.212
- Jerry Marsh is here.
SIPOWICZ: I'm Detective Sipowicz.

10:10.373 --> 10:13.126
- This is Detective Simone.
- Hey, this is about Lenny Wiley?

10:13.293 --> 10:16.046
SIMONE: Yeah. Why don't we
come back here and talk?

10:16.213 --> 10:19.444
- Can I get a cup of coffee?
- Yeah, come on. We got potfuls.

10:20.813 --> 10:24.249
- Go on, help yourself.
- We appreciate you coming in.

10:26.613 --> 10:30.492
MARSH: What do you think happened?
- We're putting that together.

10:30.653 --> 10:34.487
Can you place yourself for us
between 8 and 9 this morning?

10:34.653 --> 10:38.362
- I met him at the Mark.
- That's the St. Mark's Bar?

10:38.533 --> 10:40.364
Yeah. I paid him
some money I owed him...

10:40.533 --> 10:43.445
...went to my office
and put an ice pack on my head.

10:43.613 --> 10:45.888
How much money did you give him?

10:46.053 --> 10:48.886
- 11,400.
- Any paper on that?

10:49.053 --> 10:51.169
MARSH: No, all cash.
- That a big lose for you?

10:52.253 --> 10:57.407
Do I look like Donald Trump?
Yeah, 11,400 is a big lose.

10:59.133 --> 11:01.806
I didn't kill Lenny Wiley.

11:01.973 --> 11:06.444
I'm a type of sicko
who earns good, pays his debts.

11:06.773 --> 11:08.843
Bookies love that in a degenerate.

11:09.013 --> 11:14.326
- Anybody with him when you paid him?
- No. Met him in the bar, walked outside.

11:14.493 --> 11:18.088
- I gave him the money, got in my car.
- Did he have a car?

11:19.013 --> 11:20.332
I didn't see a car.

11:20.493 --> 11:23.849
Do you know this guy that used to drive
for him sometime, Earl Padzik?

11:24.053 --> 11:28.331
Just to nod to.
I didn't know that was his name.

11:28.533 --> 11:30.649
Anyone know that you were paying him?

11:30.853 --> 11:33.893
Couple of guys in a bar.
They're lucky they could stand up.

11:33.893 --> 11:34.848
Couple of guys in a bar.
They're lucky they could stand up.

11:35.053 --> 11:39.604
- Who do you think might've killed him?
- I don't know.

11:40.613 --> 11:43.002
I added up on the way down.

11:43.533 --> 11:45.683
- I bet with him 12 years.
- Just him?

11:45.853 --> 11:48.686
You only carry one credit card?

11:49.133 --> 11:53.604
I mean, he was a bookmaker.
I'm not gonna put him up for pope.

11:53.773 --> 11:56.048
But he wasn't a type
to cut your throat.

11:56.213 --> 12:00.365
Some guys you're three weeks late, and
suddenly you're hearing from shylocks...

12:00.533 --> 12:03.570
...paying two points a week interest.

12:04.813 --> 12:06.804
He was all right.

12:07.053 --> 12:09.965
Okay, Mr. Marsh.
Thanks very much.

12:15.293 --> 12:17.761
You think of anything might help,
you give us a call.

12:17.933 --> 12:19.969
- He wasn't married.
- That's what we understand.

12:20.133 --> 12:23.523
I show up dead,
look hard at my wife.

12:25.773 --> 12:29.049
Bobby, how was this Russell
when you worked on that case together?

12:29.213 --> 12:32.250
She did all right.
I like her.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.847
I gotta go
shut this woman down.

12:36.013 --> 12:40.848
Wear one of those beanies with the
propeller. Maybe she'll lose interest.

12:42.653 --> 12:45.531
RUSSELL: Excuse me.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

13:05.253 --> 13:06.971
MAN:
Order's up!

13:07.733 --> 13:10.611
SIMONE: Hey.
- Hey.

13:10.773 --> 13:12.411
How have you been, Bobby?

13:12.573 --> 13:15.485
- All right, Joyce. How about yourself?
- I just got a lot better.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.922
Hey, pretty good news
on that plea, huh?

13:20.493 --> 13:24.247
- No Wade hearing, no testimony.
- Yeah, it's great news.

13:26.253 --> 13:30.565
Look, Joyce. You don't mind if I don't
order anything? I gotta get right back.

13:31.333 --> 13:35.645
- Well, not right back.
- Well, I'm working homicide.

13:35.853 --> 13:40.847
You know, I recall a certain
hot dog lunch where a detective...

13:41.013 --> 13:43.322
...said he couldn't discuss
certain feelings he had...

13:43.493 --> 13:46.291
...till after a case was settled.
- Yeah, I remember that.

13:47.373 --> 13:49.682
So I thought that now
might be that time.

13:51.773 --> 13:53.092
Well, Joyce...

13:54.453 --> 13:59.163
I think that you are a really
interesting woman, Joyce.

13:59.333 --> 14:04.088
- You're attractive. Obviously bright...
- No, that's description.

14:04.253 --> 14:07.802
- Tell me how you feel.
- I am.

14:09.253 --> 14:11.813
I think that you are...

14:11.973 --> 14:15.090
...a interesting person. And I'm
grateful that you helped us out.

14:15.253 --> 14:18.529
- And?
- And...

14:22.813 --> 14:28.012
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if I read
about you in some magazine, you know?

14:28.173 --> 14:32.883
Yeah, some interesting article
about your...

14:33.053 --> 14:35.009
...you know, plant business
and so forth.

14:35.173 --> 14:37.687
- That doesn't work.
- Sorry?

14:39.453 --> 14:42.923
You made a promise, Bobby, that after
the case you'd express your feelings.

14:43.093 --> 14:44.685
I just expressed them.

14:44.853 --> 14:47.765
If you break your promise, you...

14:47.933 --> 14:50.527
You're gonna pay the consequences.

14:51.213 --> 14:52.692
Joyce.

14:53.533 --> 14:55.489
I think you heard
what you wanted to hear.

14:55.653 --> 14:57.530
I did not break
any promises to you, okay?

14:57.693 --> 15:00.207
- No. No, not okay.
- It's gonna have to be okay...

15:00.413 --> 15:02.404
...because I'm done
talking on the subject.

15:02.613 --> 15:06.162
If that's the extent of your feelings,
then you lied to me. You led me on.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.005
I'm gonna tell you something.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.289
If you had it set up in your mind...

15:10.453 --> 15:12.284
...that I was gonna be your
door prize...

15:12.453 --> 15:15.604
...for telling the truth in this case,
then that's your problem.

15:15.813 --> 15:18.122
- Do cops always lie?
- Take care of yourself, Joyce.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.763
No, don't walk away from me.
You'll be making a big mistake.

15:21.973 --> 15:23.611
Let go of my arm.

15:24.453 --> 15:26.250
I'll take back my testimony.

15:26.413 --> 15:29.803
You try and do that and you'll be saying
you lied before the grand jury.

15:30.053 --> 15:35.491
Then you go to jail.
Now I want you to let go of my arm.

15:36.253 --> 15:39.325
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

16:00.893 --> 16:04.568
- Okay.
- Mike Roberts for Detective Sipowicz.

16:04.773 --> 16:07.526
Another dead client, huh, Roberts?

16:07.693 --> 16:12.323
Hey, Andy. So how long
has Dorothy been here?

16:12.693 --> 16:13.967
A few weeks.

16:14.133 --> 16:16.044
What happened to the bim
with the tubas?

16:16.213 --> 16:19.489
Donna. I just heard
she's coming back.

16:19.653 --> 16:21.413
This guy's really quick
in his slippers, huh?

16:21.413 --> 16:21.731
This guy's really quick
in his slippers, huh?

16:21.893 --> 16:25.124
I'll tell you something.
He's good at his job.

16:25.293 --> 16:27.090
Yeah, so, what do you got on my guy?

16:27.253 --> 16:28.527
He's a dead bookie.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.133
He was not under my protection
when he passed.

16:32.293 --> 16:34.887
Why was that? We heard
he had a big pickup this morning.

16:35.053 --> 16:39.604
I did piecework for the guy. He'd call, I'd
guard him. He didn't call this morning.

16:39.773 --> 16:43.607
Was he in trouble with anybody?
Have any friction with other bookies?

16:43.773 --> 16:46.333
- Not that I know of.
- What about his driver?

16:46.533 --> 16:48.489
Earl Padzik?

16:48.653 --> 16:50.848
Give the guy an open street,
he'd hit a bus.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.728
He was with Lenny a couple months.
I think his old man used to bet with him.

16:54.893 --> 16:56.849
- Did you like this guy?
- Who? Lenny?

16:57.053 --> 16:58.611
He was all right.

16:58.773 --> 17:01.333
Not a grind-'em-up kind of guy.
He used to bet himself.

17:01.493 --> 17:04.212
He used to go up to that jai alai
fronton up in Bridgeport.

17:04.373 --> 17:07.729
Used to say, if he could figure out
what the Spanish guys with baskets...

17:07.893 --> 17:10.691
...were saying to each other,
he'd be rich.

17:10.853 --> 17:14.209
- So is there anything else?
- No.

17:14.413 --> 17:16.801
Okay, Roberts.
Thanks.

17:17.012 --> 17:19.810
Hey, listen.
Did you get anything off the cellular?

17:19.973 --> 17:22.328
- We didn't know he had one.
- Yeah, sewed to his ear.

17:22.492 --> 17:25.087
- You might get something off that.
- Good. That'll help.

17:25.292 --> 17:30.287
Hey, Andy. Occasion permits, let people
know I wasn't on duty guarding this guy.

17:30.493 --> 17:32.563
Maybe that's a selling angle, huh?

17:32.733 --> 17:36.442
Got an enemy you want dead?
Hire Roberts Security.

17:37.053 --> 17:40.363
It's Excelsior,
and that ain't funny.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.891
Wise guy.
Hey, Bobby, isn't it?

17:44.053 --> 17:47.728
- Yeah. How's it going?
- All right. Everything's terrific. All right.

17:47.893 --> 17:49.884
Yeah, okay.
I'll hold on. Yeah.

17:51.893 --> 17:53.451
Our bookie had a cell phone.

17:53.653 --> 17:56.213
- Sylvia around?
- Yeah, she's finishing an interview.

17:56.373 --> 17:58.967
And then we gotta go get
counseled by a Greek priest.

17:59.933 --> 18:03.528
Yeah, this is Sipowicz, 15th Squad.
Could you give me security?

18:04.413 --> 18:06.768
I wanna trace usage
on one of your cell phones.

18:07.493 --> 18:10.485
- Why do you need Sylvia?
- Got to talk to her on that Glover case.

18:10.653 --> 18:14.487
Looks like my witness
may be looking to queer the plea.

18:17.133 --> 18:18.646
You got a second for me?

18:19.773 --> 18:21.172
Okay.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.245
Look, we got more problems
with Joyce Novak.

18:27.133 --> 18:28.452
As you know, detective...

18:28.613 --> 18:32.401
...I'm obligated to turn over exculpatory
Brady information to the defense...

18:32.573 --> 18:35.246
I understand that, counselor.
We should discuss this then...

18:35.413 --> 18:37.643
...hypothetically, it's a problem.

18:38.373 --> 18:44.209
Say a witness was unstable
and is looking to squeeze shoes, or...

18:44.413 --> 18:47.610
...being pissed off, or for some reason
is looking to withdraw testimony.

18:47.773 --> 18:49.172
Which was correct testimony.

18:49.373 --> 18:51.728
But this witness
is looking to screw things up.

18:51.893 --> 18:55.681
What do you think would be the chance
of maybe moving up the Wade hearing...

18:55.853 --> 18:57.684
...so this witness couldn't pull out?

18:57.853 --> 19:01.687
- There is no way of moving up the time.
- No?

19:02.573 --> 19:06.691
In your hypothetical, is it certain that
the witness knows when the hearing is?

19:06.853 --> 19:08.730
Yeah. Some idiot told her.

19:08.933 --> 19:11.731
And it's certain
the witness is going to show up?

19:11.893 --> 19:14.646
It's certain the witness is a head case.

19:15.293 --> 19:19.969
I can't be sure if that's the exact plan
but I think there's a pretty good chance.

19:20.133 --> 19:23.250
Since there's no chance of changing
the time or venue of the hearing...

19:23.453 --> 19:25.842
SIMONE: I would have to prevent
the witness' appearance.

19:26.013 --> 19:29.801
Speaking hypothetically,
you might want to dissuade it somehow.

19:29.973 --> 19:34.171
Sylvia, l... Maybe we can call
Father Kankarides and reschedule?

19:34.373 --> 19:38.525
No, let's go right now.
I have to be back in court by 3.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.722
- Gonna get a printout on this guy's cell.
SIMONE: Yeah, okay.

19:45.773 --> 19:47.172
My name's Earl Padzik.

19:47.373 --> 19:51.048
I got a message to contact a
Detective Sipo-something, or Simone.

19:51.213 --> 19:54.125
SIMONE: I'm Detective Simone.
I got it.

19:55.133 --> 19:57.203
I'll see you in court, huh?

19:57.373 --> 20:00.570
- That's Sipowicz, pal.
- Thanks for coming in.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.689
What is this about?

20:03.373 --> 20:06.490
Come over, we'll go talk in the room.
Want some coffee or something?

20:06.653 --> 20:07.881
Yeah, all right.

20:08.053 --> 20:10.613
SIMONE: So you used to work
for Leonard Wiley?

20:10.813 --> 20:15.568
Yeah. I drive him sometimes.

20:15.733 --> 20:18.452
SIMONE:
When did you see him last?

20:18.813 --> 20:22.726
About 10 last night.
I dropped him off at his place in Queens.

20:22.893 --> 20:25.612
He seem worried about anything?
Say anything unusual?

20:25.773 --> 20:28.765
Not to me.
You know, "Pull over here."

20:28.933 --> 20:31.322
"Yes, Mr. Wiley."
That's as much as we talk.

20:32.093 --> 20:35.768
He's a bigshot financial manager.
I'm just a glorified cabby.

20:35.933 --> 20:38.652
He's a financial manager, Earl?

20:38.813 --> 20:41.008
And eggs come from the Easter Bunny.

20:41.213 --> 20:44.967
- You want anything with this?
- No.

20:45.493 --> 20:47.085
SIMONE:
Have a seat.

20:52.333 --> 20:55.609
- You know Wiley's dead.
- Yeah. Yeah, I heard that.

20:55.813 --> 20:57.451
Where were you this morning?

20:57.613 --> 20:59.649
Home. I live with my mother.

20:59.853 --> 21:02.606
- Why weren't you driving Wiley?
- Told me not to pick him up.

21:02.773 --> 21:04.923
He was expecting money.
Why wouldn't he use you?

21:05.093 --> 21:08.085
I don't know.
I guess you can't ask him.

21:08.253 --> 21:11.131
- No, you can't, because he's dead, right?
- Yeah.

21:11.293 --> 21:13.204
Did I say something
to make you angry here?

21:13.373 --> 21:15.967
- No.
- That seems like a smart-ass answer.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.522
I'm wondering,
you trying to piss me off?

21:18.693 --> 21:21.412
- Not really.
- So you're not trying to piss me off?

21:21.573 --> 21:22.801
- No.
- That happen often?

21:22.973 --> 21:25.009
People get pissed,
you can't figure out why?

21:25.173 --> 21:28.483
Look. I don't know
what this conversation is about.

21:28.653 --> 21:32.407
- How'd you meet Wiley, Earl?
- My dad bet with him before he died.

21:32.573 --> 21:34.131
I'd been out of work.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.763
- My ma had me call him up.
- We're gonna be talking to your mother.

21:37.973 --> 21:40.089
She's gonna tell us you were
home this morning?

21:40.293 --> 21:43.410
- That's right.
- And when we canvass by Wiley's place...

21:43.573 --> 21:45.803
...nobody will say
they saw your car picking him up?

21:46.013 --> 21:48.368
Nobody's gonna say that.

21:50.293 --> 21:52.170
We ran you through BCI, Earl.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.688
You got one collar for auto theft,
one for receiving.

21:54.853 --> 21:55.842
Uh-huh.

21:56.013 --> 21:58.607
- What were they about?
- Nothing. I was a kid.

21:58.773 --> 22:01.970
What happened here, that wasn't you
doing a robbery that got out of hand?

22:02.173 --> 22:06.769
No. I told you I didn't see him
this morning.

22:10.013 --> 22:12.049
Okay, Earl, you can go.

22:15.253 --> 22:16.925
You can go.

22:19.453 --> 22:24.004
- Keep working on that friendly attitude.
- Yeah, you too.

22:29.093 --> 22:30.685
You know, I could use your help.

22:30.853 --> 22:34.243
- What are we doing?
- Working something in court.

22:39.413 --> 22:41.005
KANKARIDES:
Please come in.

22:43.213 --> 22:44.965
Have a seat.

22:47.533 --> 22:51.003
I've known Sylvia since she was a child.
I'm not surprised...

22:51.173 --> 22:55.371
...that she answered the questionnaire
so thoroughly and intelligently.

22:55.533 --> 22:56.852
SIPOWICZ:
She do a good job?

22:57.013 --> 22:59.243
KANKARIDES:
You left some of the answers blank.

22:59.493 --> 23:01.370
The ones I thought were too personal.

23:01.533 --> 23:07.051
Sylvia, were there any questions you and
Andrew wanted to ask me as a couple?

23:09.213 --> 23:10.931
No.

23:11.093 --> 23:13.607
Then, since time seems to be a factor...

23:13.813 --> 23:16.691
...it may be most useful
if Andrew and I could chat privately.

23:16.893 --> 23:19.691
- All right, Father.
- It will only take a few moments.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.091
Please.

23:33.813 --> 23:37.169
The counseling questionnaire...

23:37.333 --> 23:39.693
...is meant to establish an atmosphere
of frankness and honesty.

23:39.693 --> 23:41.411
...is meant to establish an atmosphere
of frankness and honesty.

23:41.613 --> 23:44.730
That is why we hope
you'll answer them fully.

23:44.893 --> 23:49.569
- Maybe if I knew you better.
- Maybe we can accomplish that now.

23:49.733 --> 23:51.564
I think it'd take a longer time.

23:53.613 --> 23:56.685
You've read the couples' text
on the sacrament of holy matrimony...

23:56.853 --> 23:58.764
...and the crowning services?

23:58.933 --> 24:01.401
- Yeah, I did.
- What do you think of those?

24:01.573 --> 24:03.325
Very nice.

24:09.173 --> 24:11.448
Do you believe in God, Andrew?

24:12.693 --> 24:15.002
I'd as soon not get into that.

24:15.173 --> 24:20.691
I'm sure that in your work you must see
things that are very hard to deal with.

24:21.933 --> 24:24.083
Have you lost your faith?

24:26.413 --> 24:27.926
Yeah.

24:34.333 --> 24:38.087
Sylvia's been a favorite of mine
ever since I've known her.

24:39.053 --> 24:44.969
I think she has a great gift of spirit,
of finding the best in people.

24:45.133 --> 24:47.203
I think that's right.

24:47.373 --> 24:50.968
And you want to make her happy.
You do love her.

24:51.133 --> 24:54.409
- Yeah, I do.
- Good.

24:55.173 --> 24:56.572
Good.

24:58.773 --> 25:02.732
Very well, Andrew.
I'm glad I got to meet you.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.853
- Don't give up on God.
- Yeah, it was good to meet you.

25:06.813 --> 25:09.407
He may not be through
with you yet.

25:13.733 --> 25:16.042
Andrew and I have finished.

25:16.213 --> 25:20.286
If you both will excuse me,
I have to go and hear confession.

25:20.453 --> 25:22.330
All right, Father.

25:22.853 --> 25:25.925
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

25:26.093 --> 25:30.689
COSTAS: I hope this went well.
- Oh, yeah. It went fine.

25:30.853 --> 25:35.290
- I'll see you soon. Andrew.
- So long, Father.

25:35.973 --> 25:40.046
- Was it all right?
- Yeah. We got along okay.

25:51.853 --> 25:53.969
Trial is on for June 15.

25:54.133 --> 25:57.330
This is now 14 months.
I want both sides ready.

25:57.533 --> 25:59.842
Bail is continued
on the same conditions.

I'd like your help.

Miss Novak, I'm gonna
make a recording of this conversation.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.651
- For both our benefits.
- Go right ahead.

33:49.453 --> 33:55.005
So, what sort of sexual misconduct
by Detective Simone are you alleging?

33:55.173 --> 33:58.404
As you know, I was a witness in the
Arnold Glover murder investigation.

33:58.573 --> 34:01.246
Detective Simone was running
the investigation.

34:01.453 --> 34:04.206
At a time when I was extremely
vulnerable and frightened...

34:04.413 --> 34:07.405
...Detective Simone made
sexual overtures to me.

34:07.573 --> 34:11.532
And he initiated an intimate relationship
which he's just terminated.

34:11.693 --> 34:15.049
All right, Miss Novak.
It's important you don't react to what...

34:15.213 --> 34:18.922
...I'm gonna say now as intimidation.
- Oh, no. I'm through being intimidated.

34:19.132 --> 34:21.168
We take this kind of charge
very seriously.

34:21.333 --> 34:22.482
I'd hope you would.

34:22.652 --> 34:25.087
If Detective Simone was sexually
inappropriate with you...

34:25.253 --> 34:26.732
...I want that to come out...

34:26.893 --> 34:28.963
...and for him to receive
appropriate sanctions.

34:29.132 --> 34:32.170
- What's that? A lost day off?
- Well, if your allegations are true...

34:32.333 --> 34:35.484
...sanctions would be suspension
from the force and a jail term.

34:35.652 --> 34:37.484
That's what he deserves.

34:37.652 --> 34:41.646
But before we go forward with any
charges you may wish to file...

34:41.813 --> 34:44.964
...I want you to know that early
in his investigation, Detective Simone...

34:45.132 --> 34:48.011
...put me on notice that he
considered you mentally unstable.

34:48.172 --> 34:50.050
He and I and the district attorney...

34:50.213 --> 34:53.728
...had conversations about your changing
your account of what you saw...

34:53.893 --> 34:58.489
...and your offer to change your story
in exchange for Det. Simone's interest.

34:58.693 --> 35:01.730
These incidents were reported
by Detective Simone as they occurred...

35:01.893 --> 35:06.011
...and were noted by me in my daily
log books. They are a matter of record...

35:06.173 --> 35:07.765
...going back a number of months.

35:07.933 --> 35:10.845
And they'd provide the background
and context in which you'd be...

35:11.013 --> 35:13.891
...pursuing your charges.
- He seduced me.

35:14.093 --> 35:16.607

and conduct an investigation. I'll get...

If you're interested, there's a P.A.A. Slot
open upstairs in Anti-Crime.

38:45.493 --> 38:49.532
- Don't tease me.
FANCY: If you want, I'll talk to sarge.

38:49.733 --> 38:52.964
I'd be thrilled.
I'd love to stay in this command.

38:53.133 --> 38:55.488
FANCY: Okay, check with him.
I think it starts right away.

38:55.653 --> 38:57.484
JOHN: I will. Thanks.
- Good night.

38:57.653 --> 39:00.121
Good night, lieu.

39:01.693 --> 39:03.206
[KNOCKS]

39:03.853 --> 39:05.684
Just a second.

39:09.453 --> 39:12.331
We may have a locker hog.

39:19.693 --> 39:21.968
- Sorry. Excuse me.
SIPOWICZ: No problem.

39:24.493 --> 39:27.291
- Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

39:31.373 --> 39:33.728
- See you.
- See you.

39:36.413 --> 39:38.973
- Leaving, Bob?
- Yeah. Good night.

39:39.133 --> 39:41.931
MARTINEZ:
Good night. See you later.

39:42.093 --> 39:45.290
- Put that in the boss's tray? Good night.
JOHN: Good night.

39:56.853 --> 39:59.128
Are you going to see him now?

40:00.933 --> 40:05.165
- Are you gonna make love to him?
- Why don't you go home, get some rest?

40:05.613 --> 40:09.526
You can run his life,
but you can't run mine.

40:10.133 --> 40:12.363
Drop that, or you're going to get hurt.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.646
I thought this was for me.

40:17.813 --> 40:21.442
- But it's really for you!
- Drop it or I'll break your arm!

40:21.653 --> 40:23.371
Drop it!
Drop the knife!

40:23.533 --> 40:25.524
SIMONE: Give me that!
MARTINEZ: I got the knife.

40:25.733 --> 40:28.645
NOVAK: No, she'll destroy you!
SIMONE: Thanks, James.

40:28.813 --> 40:30.610
We'll take her inside.
Get an ambulance.

40:30.773 --> 40:33.526
NOVAK: I'm not going back there! No!
SIMONE: Joyce.

40:33.733 --> 40:35.610
- Look at me. Look at me, Joyce.
NOVAK: No. No.

40:35.773 --> 40:37.286
I'm gonna go there with you.

40:37.453 --> 40:40.809
- This is gonna be all right.
- No, it's not, as long as she's with you.

40:40.973 --> 40:44.682
SIMONE: She's not coming with us.
It's just gonna be me and you, okay?

40:44.893 --> 40:48.363
- Joyce, it's just me and you, all right?
- Yeah.

40:48.533 --> 40:53.766
Okay. Come on. I'm gonna stay
with you. Let's just go inside.

40:53.973 --> 40:57.568
- All right?
- Yeah.

41:27.893 --> 41:32.250
- I'm glad you liked Father Kankarides.
SIPOWICZ: Yeah.

41:32.413 --> 41:35.211
He was so wonderful to us
when my mom died.

41:35.933 --> 41:41.883
- To me, but to my dad, especially.
- Yeah. He seems like a nice guy.

41:47.133 --> 41:50.409
Do you wanna tell me
what you all talked about?

41:50.573 --> 41:54.805
Terms of not filling out the
questionnaire, beliefs and so forth.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.009
I worked a case once.

42:04.173 --> 42:08.803
A couple's kid was missing. A 14-month-
old kid, he wandered away in a park.

42:08.973 --> 42:12.329
And we're looking everywhere.
And there's flyers we got out.

42:13.253 --> 42:16.086
And they're interviewed on the radio.

42:16.253 --> 42:19.051
The guy's a dog trainer
in from the Midwest so he could...

42:19.213 --> 42:24.003
...take this special course
with a German shepherd he's got.

42:24.173 --> 42:24.773
And the wife's half an oiler.
You can tell she likes to drink.

42:24.773 --> 42:28.322
And the wife's half an oiler.
You can tell she likes to drink.

42:28.493 --> 42:31.644
And I'm just getting this bad feeling
from both of them.

42:31.813 --> 42:36.568
So I go at her a little bit. We're up in
their transient apartment they rented.

42:36.733 --> 42:40.282
Finally she says,
whatever happened, it wasn't her.

42:40.453 --> 42:43.525
So now I'm looking at the husband.
He's this...

42:43.693 --> 42:47.527
He's this horse-ball, tough guy.
A fake Marine.

42:47.693 --> 42:50.332
And he's talking about
how pets have to be disciplined...

42:50.493 --> 42:52.211
...and the breakdown of discipline.

42:52.373 --> 42:55.968
And I'm getting worried what might
have happened with this asshole.

42:56.133 --> 43:01.161
And now she starts screaming
it wasn't her. She was asleep.

43:01.333 --> 43:04.370
The baby peed when the father
was changing it.

43:04.533 --> 43:06.489
And, uh...

43:06.893 --> 43:09.691
And it urinated in the guy's face.

43:09.853 --> 43:13.004
He threw the baby down
and fractured its skull.

43:13.173 --> 43:15.403
And the baby lay there and died.

43:15.573 --> 43:19.885
"And what happened to the baby?"
I wanna know. And she's still screaming.

43:20.053 --> 43:24.410
And I look at this dog. And this asshole
is trying to get this dog away from me.

43:24.573 --> 43:28.771
Now I gotta cut open this dog's belly.
I take him over to the vet center.

43:28.973 --> 43:32.204
We cut its belly open.
And we gotta murder this poor dog.

43:32.373 --> 43:37.493
And there's the pieces
of the child inside the dog.

43:41.333 --> 43:44.086
He wanted to know
if I had lost my faith.

43:54.613 --> 43:56.888
I got faith in you.
