00:41.775 --> 00:44.643
Dude, I can't believe that
this is actually happening Zach.

00:44.744 --> 00:46.440
I know I know I keep feeling like
I'm going to wake up from a dream.

00:46.679 --> 00:47.703
- You want me to pinch you?
- Yes.

00:47.914 --> 00:48.904
Alright.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.011
- You said pinch!
- I'm sorry. Do me.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.453
Shit! This is actually happening.

00:57.924 --> 00:58.983
You're right.
We need to chill out.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.725
We can't look like dorks
on our first day out.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.859
Okay.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.161
Alright.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.801
Oh my god.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.281
Yeah Dickface!

01:51.744 --> 01:53.110
It's beautiful man.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.076
It's just beautiful.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.440
Good evening gentlemen.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.945
It's daytime.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.123
Mr. President.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.285
So it is.

02:05.992 --> 02:07.153
You boys are ready
to be inducted.

02:08.094 --> 02:09.824
Yes Mr. President.

02:10.395 --> 02:13.127
See, as new Alpha's these boys
have to call me Mr. President

02:13.366 --> 02:15.232
or else they get punched
in the dick.

02:16.169 --> 02:18.468
Boys, this is Charity. This is Faith.

02:19.105 --> 02:22.371
Girls this is Zach and uh...

02:22.976 --> 02:24.604
- What is it? Christian?
- Cameron.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.348
Boys, welcome to 24-hour
party machine man!

02:32.085 --> 02:34.020
Someone get these boys a beer
and a hand job.

02:36.456 --> 02:39.324
- You alright man?
- I'm just so happy.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.058
I love this place.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.040
Alright girls
put your shirts back on,

02:58.278 --> 03:00.213
we're going downstairs
for the Induction ceremony.

03:01.748 --> 03:04.047
Not you.
You're meet me in my room.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.941
Yes Mr. President.

03:08.955 --> 03:12.119
See fellas, that right there...
never gets old.

03:12.992 --> 03:14.927
Alright fellas quit fucking around
we got some cherries to pop

03:15.161 --> 03:16.459
and some serious partying to do!

03:17.664 --> 03:19.565
Oh shit, did you hear
what he just said.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.094
Oh my god.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.326
We're not even at
the serious partying yet.

03:23.469 --> 03:24.835
It's even better then I imagined.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.811
The average male graduate
makes $125,000 per year,

03:32.345 --> 03:34.610
meanwhile the average
female graduate

03:34.948 --> 03:37.144
make $41,500 per year.

03:41.154 --> 03:44.852
- This is bullshit.
- Yes! It is bullshit Misty.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.384
And why would these women

03:46.593 --> 03:50.086
put up with such inequitable
excusable desperaties,

03:50.463 --> 03:52.159
somehow the women or sterling
college get it in their heads

03:52.398 --> 03:55.732
that being married to
one of these successful men

03:55.868 --> 03:58.133
is just as good
as being successful themselves.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.136
Which is a bunch of hoowie!

04:01.908 --> 04:02.932
Yes?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.874
Is the Astronaut single?

04:05.044 --> 04:06.171
What?

04:07.113 --> 04:08.274
That's not the point.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.944
The point is that we work so hard
to get into this college.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.880
We're just not here
for the parties,

04:13.987 --> 04:17.286
the sex, and to land
some rich husband. Right?

04:20.159 --> 04:22.151
Then what are you here
Ms. Kramer?

04:23.563 --> 04:25.122
It is Ms. Kramer isn't it?

04:25.565 --> 04:27.966
- Kelly Kramer?
- Associate Dean Marshall.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.002
Yes, I know who I am.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.662
So...

04:32.205 --> 04:34.572
This is Delta Pi Sorority.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.633
I heard you were meeting.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.075
Even though
you don't have a house.

04:39.245 --> 04:40.679
I say it shows resolved.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.438
I say it shows resolve.

04:42.815 --> 04:43.942
It's pathetic!

04:46.052 --> 04:47.884
And not only that, it's unfair.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.284
Especially when you consider
how many houses

04:50.523 --> 04:52.549
of fraternities have,
am I right ladies?

04:52.759 --> 04:55.058
- Yeah.
- Defiantly.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.221
Sterling college has always offered
more opportunities

04:57.530 --> 04:58.725
to it's male students.

04:58.965 --> 05:03.027
You really think that you
and your quote unquote sorority

05:03.303 --> 05:06.330
can over turn 50 years
of history?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.439
Yes! I do!

05:12.412 --> 05:13.846
I was hoping you'd say that.

05:18.117 --> 05:19.016
Gentlemen.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.622
Today you enter an
elite brotherhood

05:22.789 --> 05:25.725
established by
our founders in 1963.

05:27.393 --> 05:30.955
Just as Sterling College is
know as the cradle of awesome,

05:31.531 --> 05:33.932
Alpha house is known as a place
where awesome

05:34.167 --> 05:35.533
goes to get it's freak on.

05:36.469 --> 05:40.270
Now, are you ready to uphold
the tradition of this fraternity?

05:40.873 --> 05:42.432
If yes, let me hear you say yeah.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.107
- Yeah!
- Good.

05:45.278 --> 05:48.271
Do you swear
to never speak ill of her.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.644
- Let me hear you say "Yeah".
- Yeah!

05:51.050 --> 05:53.849
To never let her hallow halls
fall silent.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.086
To never let her kegs
run empty.

05:57.290 --> 06:00.886
And to never ever
let the party die.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.719
Fuck yeah!

06:04.330 --> 06:07.323
Now, suck the guys dick
on your immediate left.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.032
What?

06:12.472 --> 06:14.270
- Really?
- No, I was just messing with you.

06:14.507 --> 06:15.736
I just wanted to see
if you'd really do it.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.067
I have nobody to my left.

06:18.344 --> 06:19.277
Gentlemen.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.409
Welcome to Alpha House.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.140
- Hey! Who turned off the lights?
- What the fuck?

06:29.355 --> 06:31.119
I'm sorry Mr. Kroger.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.353
Am I interrupting something?

06:34.127 --> 06:35.254
Of course not.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.692
It's always an honor to be visited
by our associate Dean.

06:38.998 --> 06:42.730
I see you're inducting
a fresh batch of perverts,

06:42.935 --> 06:44.426
drunks, and future fellons.

06:45.471 --> 06:48.999
How fratuitous that I found you
in a very excepting frame of mind.

06:49.675 --> 06:50.836
You thinking about pledging?

06:51.477 --> 06:53.105
It's very flattering
but unfortunately

06:53.212 --> 06:54.840
we're about the capacity
for the year.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.214
Though the peace offering
with the strippers

06:57.316 --> 06:58.841
was not a bad move.

06:59.118 --> 07:01.747
I see they went for
the naughty bookworm look.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.513
What you couldn't throw
in one sexy cop?

07:03.823 --> 07:05.587
You see? This is why I'm here.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.556
For too long Alpha House
has been the a bastian

07:08.928 --> 07:10.487
for sex, drugs...

07:11.230 --> 07:13.961
Stop! Stop! Stop it!
It's not a good thing!

07:14.400 --> 07:16.596
It's everything that's wrong
with Sterling College!

07:19.071 --> 07:20.733
But we are going
to transform it

07:21.073 --> 07:23.440
into a shining example
of everything

07:23.676 --> 07:24.974
that Sterling College has to offer.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.578
Opportunity. Diversity.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.816
- Equality.
- Can you get to the point?

07:30.950 --> 07:32.043
I'm sobering up over here.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.017
Gentlemen.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.749
- Meet your new brothers.
- Hello boys.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.057
As of tonight,

07:41.394 --> 07:45.525
I am making Alpha House
officially... CoEd.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.129
- No you can't.
- I can and I did.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.132
Dean Bungalon
would never approve of this.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.040
No. I doubt Dean Bungalon

07:54.240 --> 07:56.368
would give approval
to such a dramatic change

07:56.609 --> 07:58.237
to his old fraternity.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.474
But luckly fraternity matters,

08:00.880 --> 08:03.543
fall under the preview
of the Associate Dean.

08:05.518 --> 08:06.679
Which is me.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.145
This is bullshit!

08:14.727 --> 08:17.196
- What's your name potty mouth?
- Cameron.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.958
Is there something on
your feeble mind Cameron?

08:20.199 --> 08:22.896
You can't just change
a frat like this. This isn't fair!

08:23.069 --> 08:24.537
And having a Sorority
without a house is?

08:25.972 --> 08:27.770
Excellent return Renee!

08:28.107 --> 08:29.336
He means not fair to the girls.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.700
It's still a frat.

08:31.944 --> 08:32.967
You can bring a whole
bunch of girls in here

08:33.246 --> 08:34.509
but they're gonna have to live
with a whole bunch of guys.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.648
You think it's fair to make girls
live in that kind of environment?

08:40.586 --> 08:42.020
Excellent point
Cameron's friend.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.477
Zach.

08:43.722 --> 08:46.989
Don't care.
With Alpha House being CoEd,

08:47.894 --> 08:50.125
It is now written by state
and federal laws,

08:50.229 --> 08:51.925
which forbid anyone

08:51.998 --> 08:56.197
from making a member of
the opposite sex feel harassed,

08:56.736 --> 09:01.071
disentranced, or
other wise uncomfortable.

09:02.174 --> 09:06.805
It means you horn dogs
will dial down the debauchery.

09:07.446 --> 09:08.675
Significantly.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.514
How significantly?

09:11.551 --> 09:14.544
This place is going to make the Mormon
tabernacle look like Mardi Gras.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.949
Everybody will be
on their best behavior.

09:19.358 --> 09:21.953
Or else, you're out.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.460
Out of Alpha House?

09:24.263 --> 09:28.166
Out of Alpha House.
Out of Sterling College.

09:28.467 --> 09:29.799
Poop out of luck!

09:32.405 --> 09:33.373
Ladies.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.003
Why don't know go
make yourselves at home.

09:38.878 --> 09:39.971
Girls.

09:41.447 --> 09:43.313
Can someone please
buy some air freshener?

09:51.223 --> 09:52.521
This is a disaster.

09:54.894 --> 09:55.953
I'm outta here.

09:57.363 --> 09:59.025
- Where you going?
- Sorry dudes.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.694
I was only in this stupid frat only
for the booze and the cooze.

10:01.934 --> 10:02.924
What about brotherhood?

10:03.002 --> 10:04.971
What about never letting
the party die?

10:05.204 --> 10:06.763
Dude, look around.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.568
The party is dead.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.909
I should be in elbows deep
in Co-Ed trim right now.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.972
Instead of watching these
Delta Pi lesbos

10:13.112 --> 10:15.172
turn our front door
into a chastity belt.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.077
Adios losers.

10:21.587 --> 10:22.816
Enjoy your castration.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.549
Come on! Seriously guys!

10:25.758 --> 10:26.748
Wait what?

10:29.528 --> 10:30.518
Bye, bye.

10:32.598 --> 10:33.588
Well...

10:34.400 --> 10:37.962
Looks like you're the defecto
president potty mouth.

10:38.571 --> 10:39.539
Congrats.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.671
Alright, listen up.
This is how it's going to work.

10:41.841 --> 10:44.470
You two are gonna divide
up the house equally.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.908
I'm putting this on both
your shoulders.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.972
- Got it?
- Got it.

10:49.348 --> 10:50.316
Good.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.013
So this is how it's gonna work.

10:53.085 --> 10:54.451
You guys are gonna get
the rooms in the back,

10:54.887 --> 10:55.855
and we get the rooms
in the front.

10:56.088 --> 10:56.953
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:57.156 --> 11:00.684
You are talking to the acting
Alpha House president here.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.828
Okay? If anybody decides
who gets what rooms is me.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.097
Okay, so what do you suggest?

11:08.834 --> 11:10.735
Girls in the front, guys in the back.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.562
And you can share
your room with me.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.141
I'll pass. How many bathrooms
are in this hell hole?

11:16.575 --> 11:18.203
2 upstairs. 1 down here.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.110
We each get one upstairs,
the one downstairs is for guests,

11:21.547 --> 11:24.039
and the living room and
the kitchen are common areas.

11:24.316 --> 11:25.841
- Does that work for you?
- Yes.

11:26.552 --> 11:27.747
Make it so.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.022
Right.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.059
Who is that?

11:33.225 --> 11:37.128
I am not sure but I think
she wants to fuck me!

11:38.030 --> 11:39.555
That's not gonna happen.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.594
Oh yeah we'll see
about that sweetie.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.029
Oh. Melanie?

11:47.173 --> 11:48.163
Zach.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.471
Oh my god.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.075
What are you doing here?

11:52.445 --> 11:55.415
I just transferred.
I was over at state last semester.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.048
Well hello there, smelanie.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.517
Cameron. Wow.

12:00.786 --> 12:01.913
Didn't miss that!

12:02.288 --> 12:04.086
Melanie. Upstairs now.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.849
- We're having a meeting.
- Okay.

12:07.693 --> 12:11.391
Well, I guess I will be seeing you
around the house then?

12:11.630 --> 12:12.928
Yeah, I guess so.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.771
This place is repulsive.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.031
Is that a used condom?

12:26.712 --> 12:28.112
Ladies please!

12:28.814 --> 12:30.442
I know these are not
the best of arrangements.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.109
And no matter what those
cavemen downstairs think,

12:33.352 --> 12:36.015
This place is as much our
as it is theirs.

12:36.455 --> 12:37.787
The road is gonna be rough.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.687
It's gonna be dirty.

12:40.025 --> 12:41.891
And occasionally will have
a used condom in it.

12:43.028 --> 12:43.996
But we can do this.

12:46.198 --> 12:47.325
Sisters on 3.

12:50.069 --> 12:53.039
- 1, 2, 3...
- This is bullshit! Alright.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.573
We can't have chicks living here.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.907
I totally agree.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.101
Yo that brunette,

13:00.346 --> 13:02.178
I'd love to have
her Canadian swirl,

13:02.515 --> 13:04.848
on a ford bronco on 4 flat tires.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.075
Dude, what?

13:07.319 --> 13:10.585
- Makes zero sense dude.
- Look, guys this is our house!

13:10.923 --> 13:12.949
Those girls are invaders
in our territory.

13:13.392 --> 13:16.026
Cameron and I wanted to be Alpha's
for as long as I can remember,

13:16.027 --> 13:17.929
and I am not throwing
that dream that the shitter

13:18.063 --> 13:19.929
- because of some chicks.
- Me too dude but,

13:20.266 --> 13:23.100
my dream did not include
a pussy embargo.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.070
You guys are missing
the bigger picture here.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.433
Did you see the talent that
just walked into this house?

13:28.874 --> 13:31.503
At this moment
the rooms above our heads

13:31.744 --> 13:34.714
are being stocked with
some pretty decent inventory.

13:36.448 --> 13:39.475
This house is basically
a cosco full of vag, right?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.018
And if we play our cards right,

13:41.086 --> 13:43.282
we might be getting
some free samples!

13:43.522 --> 13:45.923
Besides, how bad could it be
living with girls?

13:55.634 --> 13:58.263
- What's going on?
- They're... cleaning.

13:58.804 --> 14:00.363
Nice work ladies!

14:03.008 --> 14:04.874
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

14:05.010 --> 14:06.774
Just because you're comfortable
living like pigs

14:07.012 --> 14:07.980
doesn't mean we have to be.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.315
Pink! What the hell?

15:28.193 --> 15:30.059
- What's going on?
- They're painted this room.

15:30.362 --> 15:31.330
So?

15:32.264 --> 15:33.960
They're painting this room... Pink!

15:39.305 --> 15:40.637
I fucking hate pink.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.206
I could get use
to the view though.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.820
Though I definiely give them
both cherry twisters.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.896
Enjoying the view?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.135
- Yeah.
- What did you say?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.274
- We were just...
- Right.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.278
You know these paint fumes
are making me kinda dizzy.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.486
Oh! Yeah me too.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.118
You wanna...

17:05.924 --> 17:06.892
Get outta here?

17:07.960 --> 17:09.553
- Definitely
- Okay.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.516
Bang-o-rang.

17:39.525 --> 17:40.584
Thank you.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.960
Where you going?
Where you going?

17:46.031 --> 17:47.192
Where you going?

17:52.838 --> 17:53.737
Perv!

17:55.607 --> 17:58.099
- I'm going to kill you.
- Feisty! I like that!

17:58.644 --> 18:00.112
I like that! Help me.

18:00.312 --> 18:01.302
What happened?

18:01.547 --> 18:02.810
I caught jersey shore here

18:03.015 --> 18:04.347
staring at me
through my bedroom door!

18:04.583 --> 18:06.108
Whoa! Kiss my taint, alright?

18:06.351 --> 18:08.911
I am way cooler then those
Jersey Shore douchebags!

18:08.987 --> 18:10.114
I'm taking this to Marshall!

18:10.355 --> 18:12.950
Whoa! Okay!
Pause right there alright.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.784
Nobody has to take anything
to Dean Marshall.

18:15.994 --> 18:18.930
How about, You promise to stay
in your part if the house

18:19.164 --> 18:20.826
and we'll promise to stay in ours.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.761
But... but we get
the basement, okay?

18:23.068 --> 18:25.469
You guys got to go all Martha Stewart
on the rest of the house.

18:25.704 --> 18:29.072
We get one place that's
just ours just like we like it.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.207
Deal?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.579
If I catch you
looking at me again,

18:33.946 --> 18:36.177
I'm turning your balls
into a keychain.

18:36.415 --> 18:37.610
Is that a promise?

18:40.853 --> 18:41.877
I love her.

18:44.156 --> 18:45.124
What?

18:49.428 --> 18:50.828
They're taking this place over.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.132
Then what the fuck
are we doing about it?!

18:53.198 --> 18:58.364
Cause I am one
ass hair away from leaving.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.337
We do what we do best.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.971
- And that would be?
- We be guys.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.475
We do everything we can to run
the Deltas out of this place.

19:07.713 --> 19:08.874
And back to the lecture hall
from where they came.

19:09.047 --> 19:10.709
Then we take Alpha house
back for ourselves.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.074
What about Marshall's big plan?

19:13.318 --> 19:15.913
What's he gonna do about it
if they leave voluntary?

19:16.121 --> 19:17.214
What about the bitchy one?

19:17.923 --> 19:19.084
Leave her to me.

19:20.025 --> 19:20.958
You boy ready for this?

19:22.828 --> 19:24.387
- Oh yeah.
- Good.

19:25.030 --> 19:25.998
We start at sun up.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.201
Wake up! Wake up!

19:37.042 --> 19:40.206
No shirt. Let's go! Get out!
No shirt! Nope!

19:55.394 --> 19:56.657
Listen up recruits!

19:56.995 --> 20:00.090
As acting president of Alpha House
it's my resposibility,

20:00.666 --> 20:01.599
Strike that.

20:01.967 --> 20:02.991
My pleasure

20:03.068 --> 20:05.970
to ensure that you have
the proper induction in this

20:06.872 --> 20:08.636
most honorable institution.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.300
Being an Alpha
is a goddamn privilege.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.011
A god damn privillage!

20:13.245 --> 20:15.476
And like any privilege it's earned
through hard work.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.845
- Is that right gentlemen?
- Hoo-rah!

20:19.251 --> 20:20.310
Give me a break.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.216
New recruits will as for permission
before speaking to the president!

20:23.388 --> 20:24.481
Speak to this!

20:27.559 --> 20:29.050
What is your name, recruit?

20:29.428 --> 20:30.396
Kelly Kramer.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.755
- Do you have a middle name?
- Fuck off.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.633
Oh. Pretty.

20:36.034 --> 20:37.332
People call you K2?

20:37.803 --> 20:39.829
- Nobody calls me...
- Here's the deal K2.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.168
Just as generations
of Alphas before you.

20:44.509 --> 20:45.977
You and your little femme
bots here

20:46.044 --> 20:47.637
are going to have
to endure some...

20:48.814 --> 20:51.215
minor inconveniences

20:51.450 --> 20:56.252
to demonstrate you are worthy
for a spot in this house.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.853
If any of you can't handle it,

21:00.993 --> 21:02.586
you are welcome to leave.

21:02.894 --> 21:03.987
Bring it shit weasel.

21:05.597 --> 21:06.826
Play your little games.

21:07.165 --> 21:09.191
Get that frat bullshit
out of your system.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.369
But guess what,
we're still gonna be here.

21:13.105 --> 21:13.970
Are we done?

21:14.706 --> 21:16.641
You are dismissed.

21:17.042 --> 21:18.601
Whatever. Girls.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.075
That didn't go as planned.

21:22.414 --> 21:23.905
No it did not.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.284
They have to leave!

21:26.852 --> 21:28.047
Oh they will.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.216
I have a plan.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.601
- Excuse me ladies.
- Hey!

21:44.903 --> 21:46.064
- I'm so sorry.
- Dude!

21:46.471 --> 21:48.804
- We were watching that.
- We are watching this now.

21:49.274 --> 21:50.264
Oh god!

21:51.410 --> 21:54.574
And this is how they pay
for college.

21:56.014 --> 21:59.007
Alright K2. You have a choice
of "Hole filled with cock",

21:59.351 --> 22:02.446
Brazilian Whores in Vegas.
Looks like that won an award,

22:02.721 --> 22:04.246
or white men can hump.

22:04.589 --> 22:06.524
Oh sorry,
don't have a TV in my room.

22:07.025 --> 22:08.789
Oh no problem. Boys!

22:10.128 --> 22:11.596
- Go to go boss.
- Good. Thank you.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.156
Alright!
White men can hump it is!

22:16.001 --> 22:17.731
Alright let's get those
tits bouncing!

22:18.103 --> 22:19.127
Nice!

22:22.407 --> 22:24.035
- Home movie?
- Uh sorry.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.407
It's part of... you know.

22:29.147 --> 22:31.309
It's alright hey I might
even learn a thing or two.

22:32.451 --> 22:33.419
I...

22:35.320 --> 22:36.481
Gotta go.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.820
This is not why
I joined your stupid sorority.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.498
Change is never easy Renee.

22:47.833 --> 22:51.270
We're not about to let
some smutty videos break us.

22:52.437 --> 22:53.564
We will persevere.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.068
Hello ladies!

22:56.842 --> 22:59.073
We got a treat for you.
Hand out the shirts.

22:59.644 --> 23:00.577
What is this?

23:00.746 --> 23:03.773
Oh we thought that the house
could use a little more solidarity.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.745
So what each and everyone one
of you is going to do

23:06.985 --> 23:09.648
is think of the sluttiest thing
you have ever done on the first date

23:09.855 --> 23:11.448
write it on the shirt
and wear it to dinner.

23:12.424 --> 23:14.859
- No way!
- Why not? Come on!

23:15.127 --> 23:15.958
We're doing it too.

23:16.428 --> 23:18.192
See. Solidarity!

23:18.830 --> 23:21.299
Besides president's orders,
right Cameron?

23:21.466 --> 23:23.697
- Fucking A!
- See you all at dinner.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.339
I'm not doing this.

23:28.673 --> 23:31.404
Yes you are. We all are.

23:31.676 --> 23:34.407
Think of all the women who stood up
for what they believe is right.

23:34.813 --> 23:35.781
Elizabeth Blackwell.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.350
- Susie B. Anthony.
- Snooky!

23:40.986 --> 23:44.013
If those women could endure
all they had to go through,

23:45.023 --> 23:47.322
surely we can endure this!

23:48.160 --> 23:49.184
Right ladies?

23:50.429 --> 23:51.954
All of you start writing.

23:53.131 --> 23:54.963
And be truthful.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.193
We wouldn't want
to compromise our integrity.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.173
Jessica.

24:04.543 --> 24:05.977
I said be truthful.

24:07.012 --> 24:07.980
Shit.

24:22.627 --> 24:23.595
Here.

24:24.763 --> 24:25.992
I made these for you.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.641
Dude! I don't know
what the fuck this is!

24:46.918 --> 24:48.443
Oh relax! Right.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.050
I'm on it.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.322
Is it working?

24:59.431 --> 25:02.799
Alright. Titty cam number one
is ready for it's broadcast day.

25:03.001 --> 25:03.991
Sweet.

25:04.269 --> 25:05.328
Let's roll!

25:09.841 --> 25:11.139
Right there. There.

25:30.929 --> 25:31.988
Perfection.

25:55.754 --> 25:57.484
Namaste.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.173
No, no, no. Hold it!

26:26.585 --> 26:28.019
Let's do another one.

26:35.994 --> 26:36.962
Jackpot!

26:37.128 --> 26:39.393
So don't want to go
to psych class today.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.422
Hey how was history yesterday?

26:42.133 --> 26:43.761
Fuck the feminist movement.

26:44.135 --> 26:46.866
Turn around. Turn around.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.864
They make the Disney princess
seem like they're bad.

26:51.343 --> 26:54.040
I mean, "Hello?
They get everything they wanted."

26:54.713 --> 26:56.614
- What the fuck is that?
- Bigfoot.

26:57.015 --> 26:58.244
Hey did you see that?

26:58.850 --> 27:00.011
Assholes!

27:05.090 --> 27:07.321
Zach, you have to check out
this footage.

27:07.993 --> 27:08.961
It's totally epic.

27:09.761 --> 27:11.525
- Maybe later guys.
- Titties.

27:18.036 --> 27:20.028
- Hey there.
- Fuck! Can a guy get some...

27:23.875 --> 27:24.808
Hi.

27:25.276 --> 27:26.437
Studying huh?

27:27.545 --> 27:29.707
- Trying to.
- Just like old times.

27:30.849 --> 27:32.317
You remember our first date?

27:33.685 --> 27:36.746
7th grade... after school
you asked me to meet you...

27:37.789 --> 27:39.189
- In the library.
- Right.

27:40.892 --> 27:43.361
You said you wanted me to help you
with your history assignment

27:43.595 --> 27:45.757
but I seem to remember
what you really wanted

27:45.964 --> 27:47.626
was to feel my boobs.

27:48.066 --> 27:50.092
Under the sweater over the bra
if I remember correctly.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.534
Oh you remember.

27:53.304 --> 27:55.739
- So what are you studying now?
- Oh.

27:57.375 --> 27:58.434
History.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.005
You don't say.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.576
I'll let you get to it.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.648
We should shower together
more often.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.324
Yeah, it's so much fun.

28:15.794 --> 28:16.853
It's good for the environment.

28:17.128 --> 28:19.163
- It is.
- I know!

28:19.164 --> 28:21.099
- Helping bunnies.
- Yeah!

28:27.706 --> 28:29.072
Some perverts!

28:34.713 --> 28:36.272
Do you have to be
such an asshole?

28:36.614 --> 28:39.277
I think you mean
president asshole.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.980
I'm taking this to the Dean.

28:45.323 --> 28:47.724
Ya'll would love to get her
Alabama hot pocket.

28:47.926 --> 28:49.394
I have no idea what that means.

28:49.828 --> 28:50.852
I'll tell you about it later.

28:52.263 --> 28:53.959
Stop making that. Stop.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.308
- I'm on the phone!
- I'm going to lunch.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.075
Be back by one!

29:10.949 --> 29:12.042
Try three.

29:12.984 --> 29:14.680
Yes. Yes.

29:14.953 --> 29:17.855
Well I look forward to speaking
about Virgin Mary more as well.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.917
Yes. Yes. Alpha House project
is moving forward.

29:23.828 --> 29:24.989
Students are getting along.

29:25.964 --> 29:27.330
No, no, no, no, complaints.

29:27.799 --> 29:32.066
And uh if there are
there's always provision 13.

29:37.408 --> 29:40.378
If we have to use it
we most definitely will.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.278
Listen up ladies,
the game has changed.

29:44.749 --> 29:47.617
Before you know it we're gonna
have this house all to ourselves.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.478
- How?
- Like this.

29:52.323 --> 29:53.382
What are you doing?

29:53.725 --> 29:55.489
What we have to do
to take this house.

29:55.927 --> 29:56.986
Saddle up girls.

29:57.829 --> 29:59.195
It's time to blow some minds.

30:09.174 --> 30:10.198
Hey Cameron.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.103
- Hey.
- Hey what's up K2.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.037
Um, I just really wanted
to apologize

30:16.247 --> 30:17.579
for the way
I have been acting lately.

30:18.116 --> 30:19.948
- Really?
- Yeah, you know.

30:20.051 --> 30:21.075
I know it must be weird

30:21.386 --> 30:22.820
being forced to live
with a whole bunch of women.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.922
It's a lot to take in all at once.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.952
That's cool.
We've been having fun.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.690
Yeah, totally. Us too.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.897
Anyways, the girls and I kinda want
to offer you a peace offering.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.995
- Oh. A peace offering?
- Yeah.

30:37.769 --> 30:39.863
You know, for all the trouble
we caused you.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.768
It's the least we can do.

30:43.274 --> 30:46.244
So... dinner tonight
at the house.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.876
- On us?
- Sure. Sounds good.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.072
Perfect. I'll see you then.

30:51.583 --> 30:52.812
And remember to dress nice.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.519
We got something
really special planned.

30:55.553 --> 30:56.521
Alright.

30:56.654 --> 30:57.952
- See ya.
- Okay, bye.

31:04.629 --> 31:05.597
God.

31:21.813 --> 31:23.008
Good evening gentlemen.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.243
We your alpha sisters
would like to thank you

31:25.516 --> 31:27.883
for welcoming us
so warmly into your home.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.946
As a token of our gratitude,

31:30.154 --> 31:32.487
we prepared a very special meal
for you tonight.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.125
One that I think you'll remember
for a very long time.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.728
Please take a seat.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.356
Enjoy your dinner boys.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.599
I don't know about you fellas
but I am famished.

32:32.350 --> 32:33.943
Time for stage 2.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.649
Yes.
Associate Dean Marshall please.

32:46.364 --> 32:47.798
Don't you like what you see?

32:48.399 --> 32:49.992
Everything looks delicious.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.728
Help yourself.

33:02.113 --> 33:03.604
No, no, no, no.

33:04.115 --> 33:06.209
No! No, no, no, no.

33:09.053 --> 33:10.316
Relax Relax. Okay.

33:23.768 --> 33:26.237
Do you have any wasabi?

33:27.238 --> 33:28.262
Of course.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.759
Bang-o-rang.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.131
Dude, they're just boobs.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.235
No, no, no, no. He's chocking!

34:07.645 --> 34:09.670
- Oh my god!
- Does anybody know the heimlich?

34:09.914 --> 34:11.246
Everybody relax, I'm a lifeguard.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.846
Careful.

34:19.924 --> 34:22.052
- Geez are you okay?
- Am I okay? Look at my face!

34:22.527 --> 34:24.996
- Asshole!
- What's going on?

34:28.766 --> 34:29.734
Oh.

34:50.054 --> 34:54.047
I'd say I was disappointed,
that doesn't quite cover.

34:55.193 --> 34:58.186
- Disrespected Irate Melancholy...
- Pissed off!

34:58.996 --> 35:00.760
- I think does it.
- It's a good one.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.196
Because of your antics,

35:03.868 --> 35:05.803
and heinous treatment of sushi

35:05.970 --> 35:08.235
I've been forced to expel
members of your fraternity

35:08.506 --> 35:10.441
for indecency and fraternization.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.041
And I particularly expected
more from you Ms. Kramer.

35:13.144 --> 35:15.636
- Me too.
- Shut up potty mouth.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.276
I'm so sorry Sir.
It won't happen again.

35:18.850 --> 35:19.749
Good.

35:20.084 --> 35:22.952
Because I will not hesitate

35:23.588 --> 35:26.524
to put each and everyone of you
out in the street,

35:27.291 --> 35:29.954
if you cannot follow the rules.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.157
That is all.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.231
I'm so sorry.

35:41.439 --> 35:42.600
Edgar's gone.

35:43.241 --> 35:44.641
So, what are we done?

35:45.443 --> 35:46.706
We're just getting started.

35:47.011 --> 35:47.979
We dial it up a notch.

35:48.212 --> 35:49.976
We just can't get caught
in the process.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.953
One man eliminated, but now...

35:57.054 --> 35:58.488
we've lost two of our own.

35:59.590 --> 36:00.649
That was sloppy.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.094
From now on we play smarter.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.355
We play harder.

36:05.096 --> 36:06.758
We can't afford to have
anymore casualties.

36:15.106 --> 36:15.971
That's awesome.

36:19.877 --> 36:21.812
Chuckie, you sure
it's gonna work?

36:22.013 --> 36:25.006
Dude, please. I switched
the DVDs this morning.

36:27.151 --> 36:30.315
Well... This is
going to be educational.

36:37.562 --> 36:38.495
Good afternoon.

36:39.997 --> 36:42.728
My presentation
is on Pompeii.

36:45.670 --> 36:49.266
In 79 A.D. the Italian city
of Pompeii was destroyed

36:49.574 --> 36:51.736
by the sudden
and devastating eruption

36:52.009 --> 36:53.102
of Mount Vesuvius.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.680
For centuries before
this ruin however,

36:58.149 --> 37:00.084
Pompeii was
a thriving metropolis

37:00.551 --> 37:02.918
A place of wealth
and abundance.

37:04.155 --> 37:06.784
In fact, it's citizens produced
works of art,

37:07.124 --> 37:08.148
dance and music.

37:08.559 --> 37:09.652
Still admired till this day.

37:10.094 --> 37:11.084
You don't say.

37:13.531 --> 37:14.396
Thanks.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.560
Little did the people know
the dangers lurking

37:18.836 --> 37:20.600
in the peeks
and mountains near by.

37:32.283 --> 37:33.273
Shit!

37:42.560 --> 37:43.721
Stop!

37:48.733 --> 37:51.293
I'm gonna kill your children
and your children's children.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.470
Uh! Come on!

38:02.079 --> 38:05.072
Fuck!

38:09.153 --> 38:11.053
So, Abby seems
to think you guys

38:11.054 --> 38:13.957
have something to do
with her presentation...

38:14.992 --> 38:17.257
I assure you
we had nothing to do

38:17.561 --> 38:18.756
with the destruction of Pompeii.

38:20.264 --> 38:21.288
Whatever.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.967
I'm sorry that Edgar
got kicked out last night.

38:26.671 --> 38:27.661
Yeah.

38:28.005 --> 38:29.439
Same about Jessica and Katie.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.944
Who would have thought
that Associate Dean Douchebag

38:34.011 --> 38:35.377
was actually a man of his word.

38:37.014 --> 38:40.314
Still not sure why he showed up
at that exact moment though.

38:41.919 --> 38:43.012
It's bad luck I guess.

38:43.654 --> 38:44.678
Hey.

38:45.256 --> 38:47.487
Do you remember
that night in High School

38:47.758 --> 38:49.351
when we were in
Johnny Peterson's basement

38:49.593 --> 38:53.030
and you threw up
all over his coffee table?

38:53.264 --> 38:55.096
Oh! Yes.

38:55.533 --> 38:57.126
I told his mom
I was sick with the flu.

38:57.601 --> 39:00.002
Did not have the heart to tell her
that we got into his dad's liquor.

39:00.271 --> 39:02.240
Yeah, I drank you
under the table that night.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.236
- What?!
- I'm just saying

39:04.475 --> 39:06.307
you are kind of a lightweight.

39:06.544 --> 39:07.842
- Oh really?
- Really.

39:08.245 --> 39:09.110
Really.

39:10.047 --> 39:11.037
Really?

39:12.583 --> 39:16.520
Ladies and Gentlemen
welcome to sit or strip.

39:16.954 --> 39:18.786
The rules are simple.
You flip this coin

39:19.090 --> 39:21.116
and call it in the air.
You're right, you take a shot.

39:21.525 --> 39:25.087
Get it wrong, you remove an article
of clothing and take a shot.

39:26.597 --> 39:29.431
If you pass out
or end up naked you're out.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.068
- The last man...
- Uh...

39:33.037 --> 39:34.005
or woman...

39:34.605 --> 39:37.073
standing wins the game.

39:37.074 --> 39:38.064
There are no prizes.

39:38.275 --> 39:40.676
This is simply a challenge
to determine the better sex.

39:41.946 --> 39:43.972
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

39:44.148 --> 39:47.516
- I said are you fucking ready?
- Yeah!

39:50.488 --> 39:52.252
Good! Let the games begin.

40:53.918 --> 40:55.944
- Tails.
- Tails! Tails! Tails!

41:01.826 --> 41:02.725
Alright!

41:57.214 --> 41:58.614
So beating you right now.

41:59.116 --> 42:00.675
Alright. Then let's finish this.

42:03.854 --> 42:04.913
Heads.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.673
Easy now.

42:28.245 --> 42:30.441
- I want a rematch.
- Okay lie back.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.880
Because you are very,
very drunk right now.

42:43.794 --> 42:44.921
We can't do this.

43:18.495 --> 43:19.485
Zach.

43:23.467 --> 43:24.491
Hey.

43:27.905 --> 43:28.964
Light Weight.

43:45.356 --> 43:48.349
So, what is it this time?

43:56.767 --> 43:57.962
What am I doing here?

43:58.369 --> 43:59.598
How did I get here?

43:59.903 --> 44:00.962
You pig!

44:08.812 --> 44:10.178
What the hell is going on here?

44:11.682 --> 44:12.980
Exactly what I said what happen

44:13.050 --> 44:14.746
when one of your boys
cross the line.

44:15.085 --> 44:16.246
- What? No body...
- I found them

44:16.453 --> 44:18.046
with a few of my girls
in their rooms.

44:18.255 --> 44:20.451
Oh! Sounds pretty
consensual to me.

44:20.758 --> 44:23.193
No, it sound like you conspired
to get them drunk

44:23.560 --> 44:24.550
so you can take
advantage of them.

44:24.895 --> 44:26.158
Oh! Horse shit!

44:26.363 --> 44:27.387
You were there!

44:27.798 --> 44:30.768
I suggest you boys begin
adhering to the rules.

44:31.435 --> 44:34.872
Otherwise, You'll all be looking
for a new home.

44:39.543 --> 44:41.409
Kelly is gonna wipe us out
if we don't get some help.

44:43.080 --> 44:44.673
I think I know just the person.

45:09.173 --> 45:11.039
Yo. Who is that?

45:12.443 --> 45:15.242
That my boys
is my cousin Natalie.

45:15.546 --> 45:16.673
She's our inside man.

45:17.614 --> 45:18.604
Cameron.

45:19.883 --> 45:20.851
Boys.

45:21.785 --> 45:22.844
I heard you need some help.

45:22.986 --> 45:24.352
Yeah, you have no idea.

45:28.158 --> 45:30.150
Come on, baby.
What about that?

45:35.666 --> 45:36.690
Oh yeah.

45:37.668 --> 45:38.636
God!

45:41.772 --> 45:43.934
- Dean Marshall
- I am busy Stephanie!

45:44.374 --> 45:46.570
- He's busy.
- I don't give a rat's ass!

45:47.144 --> 45:49.978
Marshall! What the devil
are you up to?

45:50.414 --> 45:51.438
Dean Bungalon.

45:52.249 --> 45:54.616
I'm not quite sure
what you are referring to.

45:55.085 --> 45:56.018
Alpha House?

45:56.286 --> 45:59.017
You're trying to launch
some kind of CoEd program?

45:59.356 --> 46:02.451
Yes yes, the uh first of it's
kind in the state in fact.

46:04.027 --> 46:05.359
Very progressive.

46:05.629 --> 46:08.497
And certainly within
my remit as Associate Dean.

46:08.665 --> 46:09.997
But I hear it has resulted

46:10.400 --> 46:12.801
in the ejection of some students
from the faternity.

46:13.036 --> 46:15.631
Yes, it's an unfortunate
but necessary.

46:15.873 --> 46:17.068
My ass.

46:17.841 --> 46:19.173
I cannot for the life
of me figure out

46:19.409 --> 46:21.105
why you would think
is a good idea

46:21.245 --> 46:24.306
to put a bunch of sexed up
young adults under one roof.

46:25.149 --> 46:26.412
What did you think
was going to happen?

46:26.517 --> 46:28.952
The benefits of the program
far out way the risks.

46:29.686 --> 46:32.884
Making the Greek system
CoEd fosters a unity

46:32.990 --> 46:34.515
between the genders,
and offers for a more...

46:35.092 --> 46:36.993
cohesive living situation.

46:38.228 --> 46:40.493
But no fraternization
with the opposite sex?

46:41.365 --> 46:43.334
You're suppressing
their natural urges.

46:43.867 --> 46:46.359
- Hell when I was an Alpha...
- Yes. Yes. We...

46:46.804 --> 46:48.864
all know about the old days
when you were went Greek sir.

46:51.008 --> 46:54.069
The point is students come
to Sterling College

46:54.478 --> 46:56.106
to learn and to have fun.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.408
Not to be put into some
social experiment.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.208
I appreciate your concern sir.

47:01.385 --> 47:04.116
I don't know
what your end game is Marshall,

47:04.188 --> 47:08.250
But if I get a call that this
little plan of yours went tits up...

47:09.293 --> 47:10.659
It's your ass.

47:11.028 --> 47:13.327
- Not mine.
- Tits up my ass.

47:14.064 --> 47:14.929
Got it.

47:15.732 --> 47:17.997
Will there be anything else? Sir?

47:18.468 --> 47:19.458
No.

47:19.703 --> 47:21.262
Carry on with um...

47:22.105 --> 47:23.266
Whatever it is that you do in here.

47:31.348 --> 47:33.283
Ladies. This is Natalie.

47:33.483 --> 47:35.008
She just transferred to Sterling.

47:35.285 --> 47:36.913
So please make her feel at home.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.289
- Hi Natalie.
- Hey

47:39.690 --> 47:41.283
- I'm Emery.
- I'm Allison.

50:26.223 --> 50:28.590
- Any progress with Kelly?
- No progress there.

50:28.792 --> 50:31.352
That is wrapped tighter then
a condom on Peter North's dick.

50:32.095 --> 50:33.825
Just keep on trying to break
that hymen okay?

50:33.997 --> 50:36.899
If you see any opportunity
to take some leverage, take it.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.002
Roger that.

50:38.602 --> 50:39.797
I love you cousin.

50:46.676 --> 50:48.076
I need you to do
some research for me.

50:48.845 --> 50:50.313
I think we have a double agent
in our midst.

50:50.914 --> 50:53.281
Find out everything you can
from that new girl Natalie.

50:53.650 --> 50:54.618
I'm on it.

50:56.119 --> 50:57.644
Time to turn up the heat.

51:04.561 --> 51:08.089
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
Okay not-not in here.

51:09.766 --> 51:11.962
This is our basement okay?
This is our territory.

51:12.969 --> 51:15.336
Haven't you heard
about burlesquercise?

51:24.214 --> 51:25.204
Okay but...

51:26.283 --> 51:27.683
5 minutes.

52:02.853 --> 52:05.118
Umm, you could make it 10.

54:04.040 --> 54:05.736
Yeah go sexy.

54:06.876 --> 54:08.037
Yeah.

54:12.315 --> 54:13.510
Oh.

54:17.153 --> 54:18.121
I think I want more.

54:19.322 --> 54:20.255
Alright.

54:20.757 --> 54:21.986
Yeah baby.

54:22.993 --> 54:23.983
There we go.

54:24.361 --> 54:25.522
Sexy!

54:32.335 --> 54:34.930
- Oh shit!
- Oh!

54:37.407 --> 54:39.000
What is going on in here?

55:00.230 --> 55:01.198
So close.

55:03.366 --> 55:05.995
Dude, we should all
just leave the house, okay?

55:06.202 --> 55:07.465
We're dropping like flies.

55:07.771 --> 55:09.603
I wish I could get Allison
to drop her pants.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.438
I bet her cooz is like fine china.

55:12.809 --> 55:14.505
Dude, now
you're just being creepy.

55:15.045 --> 55:17.446
Guys we can do this.

55:18.448 --> 55:20.144
We're Alpha's for Christ sake!

55:20.383 --> 55:22.284
Alright, we'll wear them down.
You'll see.

55:34.364 --> 55:36.492
Umm... You okay?

55:36.800 --> 55:37.927
We're not going to make it.

55:38.168 --> 55:40.137
Not with you girls walking around
the house flaunting your goods.

55:40.270 --> 55:41.431
Flaunting our goods?

55:41.705 --> 55:43.071
We're not built
to defend against this.

55:43.206 --> 55:45.971
It's like you're actually
trying to get us tossed out.

55:50.347 --> 55:52.077
All I ever wanted
is to be an Alpha.

56:05.295 --> 56:06.319
What are you doing?

56:07.263 --> 56:08.788
Flaunting my goods.

56:40.563 --> 56:41.496
Feeling better?

56:41.998 --> 56:43.591
Ah... Yeah.

56:47.470 --> 56:48.870
I need to tell you something.

56:50.507 --> 56:51.770
You're right about us.

56:53.042 --> 56:55.068
Kelly is trying to take over
Alpha House

56:55.145 --> 56:56.670
and turn it into a sorority.

56:57.013 --> 56:59.414
What? How?

56:59.716 --> 57:03.050
It's something called
provision 13.

57:03.653 --> 57:06.919
It states that if the ratio of
either gender falls below 40%

57:06.990 --> 57:09.960
the gender that has the majority,
has control.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.258
That's why you guys
have been getting kicked out

57:12.395 --> 57:13.988
so that we have the majority.

57:16.032 --> 57:18.001
We've been playing you
the entire time.

57:21.838 --> 57:22.999
I'm sorry.

57:34.784 --> 57:36.116
You asshole!

57:36.719 --> 57:38.051
You crossed enemy lines!

57:38.321 --> 57:39.914
I can't believe
you're fucking her!

57:40.123 --> 57:42.115
- Smelenie! Of all of them.
- It was just once!

57:43.126 --> 57:44.185
And a half.

57:47.030 --> 57:48.498
Okay. Look.

57:49.032 --> 57:51.627
I am sorry that I punched you.

57:51.935 --> 57:53.563
But you fucking deserve it,
you know that?

57:53.803 --> 57:55.669
- I know.
- Shit!

57:56.573 --> 57:57.541
Shit!

57:58.575 --> 58:00.271
So what do we do now huh?
Big guy!

58:03.012 --> 58:04.002
I have an idea.

58:12.555 --> 58:13.921
Alright sneak
into Dean Marshall's office,

58:14.157 --> 58:15.648
and find out whatever we can
about this prevision 13 bullshit

58:15.792 --> 58:17.693
and use it against the girls.
Shit security!

58:17.894 --> 58:19.385
- Go, go, go!
- What are you doing?

58:36.713 --> 58:38.272
Okay let's do this.
Quick in and quick out.

58:38.481 --> 58:39.710
- Like your mama?
- Dick.

58:40.984 --> 58:41.952
Okay.

58:46.623 --> 58:47.556
You finding anything?

58:48.091 --> 58:48.956
No!

58:49.926 --> 58:51.656
Dude, dude, dude check it out!

58:53.963 --> 58:54.953
What!?

58:58.167 --> 59:01.194
Got it. Alright now let's rub
our balls all over his office.

59:01.571 --> 59:02.732
- Dibs on his phone!
- Okay!

59:05.909 --> 59:06.877
Shit!

59:07.410 --> 59:09.311
Shit! Come on, come on, come on.

59:12.348 --> 59:15.716
I want you to fuck me
on my freak boss's desk.

59:19.389 --> 59:20.652
Treat me like a bad girl.

59:21.024 --> 59:23.516
You're such a freak wanting
to do it in Marshall's office.

59:26.796 --> 59:28.025
Enjoy it while it's here baby.

59:29.532 --> 59:31.023
Marshall's gon his eye
on the Dean position

59:31.334 --> 59:32.700
at Virgin Mary College.

59:33.002 --> 59:36.962
Prestige. Expensive.
And all girls.

59:38.074 --> 59:39.975
Why do you think he came up
with that freak idea

59:40.343 --> 59:42.107
to CoEd all the fraternities.

59:43.112 --> 59:45.843
He had to show
his commitment in order to seal...

59:46.082 --> 59:47.744
the... deal.

59:48.151 --> 59:49.619
Marshall is such a fucking freak.

59:50.086 --> 59:53.147
He only wants that job
so he can flirt with college girls.

59:54.624 --> 59:55.683
Flip.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:02.497
Gentlemen.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.628
We are not gonna sit idly by

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:08.669
and watch our beloved fraternities
be stolen from beneath our feet.

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:11.072
From this night forward,
we do everything in our powers

01:00:11.073 --> 01:00:12.633
to stop the advancement of Kelly

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:14.035
and the monkey dick lover
that we know

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.079
- as Associate Dean douchebag.
- How?

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.512
Well...

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:20.876
Enough with the drawings.
Just tell them the plan.

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:25.214
Well first we vow not
to touch the poon.

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:29.288
So keep it in your pants.
Then, those lying,

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.287
disingenuous,

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:34.696
fragalent, mendacious, perfidious

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:38.028
whores at their own game.

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.068
Who's with us?

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.400
Ladies and Gentleman.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:48.668
Welcome to Greek Charity days

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:51.106
where all proceeds
earned by students

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:53.907
are donated to the charity
of every fraternity

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.813
and sororities choice.

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:04.891
Yep. No exactly the turn out
I was expecting.

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:09.623
- But it's... Pretty shitty.
- Yeah it's pretty shitty

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:14.368
The girls seem to be
doing pretty well.

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.267
Suspiciously well.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:20.003
Come and get your kisses!

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.815
- Dude give me $10 dollars.
- Dude stop it. Alright.

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:33.020
Hey everyone...

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:35.951
- Look!
- Give money to Chair Titty Day!

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.824
Oh are you gonna squirt me
with your big gun?

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:46.802
That will be $75 dollars.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:49.604
Thanks.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.172
You think you can score?

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:01.942
- Dude we are in trouble man.
- Big trouble.

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.487
- Zach.
- Uh Zach?

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:07.648
- Zach who?
- Oh come on Cameron.

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:12.987
Oh! Zach!
He's not here. Do you see him?

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.533
Really?
You're that pissed at me?

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:21.135
He says that you lied to him
and that he was bad at the sex.

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:23.634
What did you expect me to do?

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:26.441
I'm trying to fit in.
Be part of the group. Just like you.

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:28.044
You would have done
the same thing.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.307
Probably already have.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.182
He says he has nothing else
to say to you.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.008
Well I have nothing else
to say to him either.

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:36.844
Dude she's cute.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.052
We need to figure something out.
We need to...

01:02:38.053 --> 01:02:39.987
- Decent body too.
- We need to get serious!

01:02:39.988 --> 01:02:42.049
Hey I have a question if you're
ever done with her you think...

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.491
Cam!

01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:46.528
- You like her!
- Shut up.

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:49.392
You like Smelanie!
I fucking knew it.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:55.731
Hey guys Zach like Melanie.

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:57.165
Oh okay,

01:02:57.273 --> 01:03:00.038
and I swear to Christ I'm gonna
punch you right in the gooch.

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:03.604
What you got?

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.673
- Almost finished.
- Check it out.

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.051
- Nice.
- And the website?

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.547
Ready to roll.

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:16.092
5 bucks a day
keep the blue balls away.

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.149
Make it 10.

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:19.488
We're getting creamed out there.

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:22.562
- 10 it is.
- Come back time.

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:33.802
I know that Kelly is in this
whole empowerment thing but,

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:36.808
I kinda just want to rage and...

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:39.208
get some dick, you know?

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:41.072
Shit.

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:51.727
Hey Rene can you move
to the right a bit?

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:52.962
Why?

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:58.031
I wanted to get a better look
at your bra. It's really nice.

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.269
- You think so?
- Yeah can I see it?

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:03.801
Yeah. I finally splurged
and got myself some nice ones.

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:06.974
Here you go.

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:09.470
Perfecto.

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:11.272
It is nice.

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:13.813
I love your cousin.

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.679
Touch her and I'll kill you man.

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:16.953
Literally.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.852
- It's cute.
- It would get me dick.

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.114
It definiteluy would.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.528
Nice job boys.

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.154
We have a problem.
Camera 7 is offline.

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:30.556
- Which one is that?
- The one in K2's room.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.899
Shit you think she found it?

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:35.434
I don't know.
If she did she'd be in here

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:37.071
cutting our dicks off, right?
Wouldn't she?

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.073
Oh fuck.

01:04:59.128 --> 01:04:59.993
Dude, so how much
we made so far?

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:01.755
- $12,000 dollars.
- What?

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:03.091
Yeah, and that's
just the first day dude.

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:05.301
I'm telling you Zach
if we keep going like this

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:07.069
we're gonna be able
to buy our own fraternity.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:08.367
Hey February!

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.636
Dude that's like the 3rd time
that's happened to me today.

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:13.074
- What? Called you February?
- Yeah, weird right?

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.232
Yeah.

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.104
Hello boys.

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:19.045
You'd like your copies
autographed?

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.550
Ladies, there's plenty me
to go around.

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:25.146
Um exactly
what am I autographing?

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:26.353
This.

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:28.450
Oh shit!

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:30.249
What happened to my dick?

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:31.959
I know. I'm so sorry.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.397
This is not what I look like!
This is not what I look like!

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.822
I have a friend that's really good
at photo editing.

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:37.964
Give me that.

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:42.637
Mine's crooked!

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:44.363
Actually it's a perfect right angle.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.068
- My dick does not look like this!
- Dude calm down.

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:50.103
No. No I will not calm down!

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:51.481
I need the world to know that

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.845
I don't have a god damn
90 degree penius!

01:05:54.183 --> 01:05:56.118
In fact, I'm gonna show
every body!

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:58.254
Dude keep your pants on.
Keep your pants on.

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:00.054
- This is not over.
- Not yet.

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:01.984
- Come on. No.
- I wanna show'em.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:03.923
- Kelly.
- What's wrong?

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.492
I got the research you asked
for on Natalie.

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:07.994
Cousins?!

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:27.947
Leverage.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:35.550
Kelly?

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.962
Are you there
you bad, bad girl?

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:46.501
What are you guys
doing here?

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.005
We got the note from Kelly
and said she wanted to party.

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.669
Shit. We've been set up.

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.065
Come on we have
to get out of here.

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.437
Oh my god!

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:58.446
What are you doing in my room?

01:06:59.015 --> 01:06:59.983
With drugs!

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:01.612
And fetish wear.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.944
I told you
they were out of control.

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:08.121
Well Dean Bungalon,

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:11.083
I think you will agree
there really is no choice here.

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:17.356
I agree.

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:19.733
Gentlemen.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:21.938
Madam.

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.132
You're out!

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.142
Dude.

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:28.004
Well, that's it then

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.579
without these 2 the guys
have less the 40%.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.781
And even without
Miss lady pain here,

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:34.108
we've still got the majority.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.214
Alpha House is ours!

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:44.090
You know it didn't have
to be this way.

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:47.997
We could have changed
Sterling College for the better.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:53.036
We could have found a way
to live together as equals.

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:59.002
But instead you had to sow
the seeds of discontent.

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:00.902
And you know what happened,

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:04.011
you rapped
the fucking world wind!

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:05.444
That's what happen!

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:12.414
You're sexy when
you're megalomaniacal.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:13.946
Laugh it up frodo.

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:18.050
But tonight I'll be sleeping
in my nice warm bed.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.060
In this very house.

01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:22.124
Where will you be sleeping?

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:26.294
Oh well it's Tuesday so that
would be with your mom!

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:30.604
Oh!

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:35.004
Later losers.

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:37.872
Come on ladies let's go.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:41.849
I'm really sorry boys.

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:44.446
I wish there was something
I could do.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.689
Yeah, yeah me too but um...

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:49.055
Unfortunately
my hands are tide.

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:50.752
Yeah I'm sure.

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:53.151
Come on guys.

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:13.214
I brought all the paperwork
to officially turn Alpha House

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:14.917
in the Delta Pi Sorority.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:16.845
All you have to do
is sign right here.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.921
Is there something wrong?

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:26.288
I'm afraid we are going
in a different direction.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:31.832
You see, CoEd fraternity project
was meant to showcase

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.027
how Sterling College fosters
productive interacting

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.363
between the genders.

01:09:36.037 --> 01:09:39.202
I'm sure you will agree it was
an unmitigated disaster.

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.076
I don't understand.
What about provision 13?

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:43.577
Give you the fraternity?

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.475
Oh I don't know?
Why don't I also open up a brothel?

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.078
After what you girls did?

01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:54.888
Oh I don't think so.

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:57.117
I did what you told me to do.

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.087
Can you prove that?

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.696
Oh! I don't think so.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:07.128
You have 24 hours
to vacate Alpha House.

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:13.064
That is all.

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:27.953
Girls.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:32.286
We need to talk.

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.729
- Alpha is no longer a fraternity.
- Yeah no shit!

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:38.930
You made sure
of that cruela devil.

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.134
We were just following
Marshall's orders.

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:42.268
He told me he wanted to show

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:44.439
how he was a big supporter
of female empowerment

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:47.475
by turning those sexist fraternity
on campus into sorority.

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.609
But in the end he just
wanted to shut it down.

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:52.241
- And he used us to do it.
- Wait? Shut it down?

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:54.474
Completely. Abandon.
Boarded up.

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:55.946
We're just as homeless
as you are.

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:58.051
I know that
I don't deserve this.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.414
That we don't deserve this
after what we did but,

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.686
We can't back and
watch Alpha House disappear.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.951
- What we?
- Yes we!

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:08.194
That dickweed needs
to get what's coming to him.

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:10.026
Nobody crosses
Kelly Dorothy Kramer.

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:14.269
- Dorothy.
- Shut up!

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:16.771
Now you're gonna help us
get Alpha House back or what?

01:11:17.506 --> 01:11:20.999
I don't know. You did already
break our trust once.

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.004
Please.

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:24.703
We'll do anything.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:26.415
Anything?

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:42.831
Looking good ladies.

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:45.130
We're in. Admin Building 2pm.

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:48.537
And don't feel the need to change
in the count of us, okay?

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:56.979
I'm sorry but there
is absolutely nothing I could do

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.106
to over turn Associate
Dean Marshall's decision.

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:00.672
What about the Alpha Creed?

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.747
Yeah! Once and Alpha
always an Alpha!

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:05.052
I really wish I could help you.

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:08.385
Thank you sir
we really appreciate your time.

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:12.486
Of course...

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:15.188
If Marshall was to lose his position
with the administration,

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.963
all of his policies
would be reviewed.

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.333
Wh... wait a minute
are you saying that

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:22.232
if we get Dean Marshall
kicked out of the college

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.134
that we might be able
to get Alpha House back?

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.973
Well the reason for his dismissal
would have to be something...

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:31.005
pretty F'n dishonorable.
Something so scandalous

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:34.647
that the college
would disown all of his decisions.

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.678
Just to distance itself from him.

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.417
Dishonorable.

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:40.287
Scandalous.

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:41.947
We'll do it.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:46.085
Of course this conversation
never happened.

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.488
Of course. Thank you Dean.

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:53.996
Once an Alpha always an Alpha.

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:57.870
Cameron, you take a team
into Marshall's office.

01:12:58.073 --> 01:13:00.008
Place cameras here, here, here.

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:01.299
Roger that.

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.804
Once you're in, be fast.
In and out.

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:06.777
But make sure the cameras
are invisible. Undetectable.

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:08.076
We need full coverage.

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:10.251
Right there. Right there.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.247
Go, go, go, go!

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:13.544
Come on let's go!

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.382
Whatever he does in that office
we need to see it.

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:17.651
What do you think we'll find?

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.455
I don't know but based on
what his assistant said

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.994
probably some freaky ass shit.

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:36.011
Did he us ask
to get fucked in the ass

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.808
by a chick wearing
a squirrel costume?

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.079
Yeah I think so.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.913
I think I just puked
in my mouth a little.

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:43.611
What are we gonna do with
all this Intel after we gather it?

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:45.213
We bait the trap.

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:51.726
Stephanie. I see you're working.

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:57.358
What's this?

01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:05.340
Oh, oh, oh my.

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:13.179
I'm going to lunch.

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:16.741
Whatever.

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.036
What's the password?

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.606
Acorn. Acorn!

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:41.101
Hello. Anyone here?

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:53.617
- Umm, Miss furry Doublestuff?
- Hold on.

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:55.385
Make yourself at home.

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:04.129
Wow, I knew
you had a lot of stuff but...

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:06.735
Oh...

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.241
This is so disgusting.

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:17.105
I think you mean
this is so awesome.

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.919
Is this what you wanted
Mr. Rosenbush?

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:38.133
Sweet baby Jesus
what am I seeing?

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.931
Umm please.

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:43.328
Call me tiger.

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:47.875
His porn name
is tiger Rosenbush?

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.837
It's better then mine.
Mocki Mckenley.

01:15:51.413 --> 01:15:54.076
- See k2 what you do...
- I know how it works.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.344
And no I'm not
gonna tell you my name.

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:00.145
Okay.

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:01.991
Tiger.

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:11.834
Take your pants off.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:14.964
Right away Miss Doublestuff.

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:21.800
Almost there.

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.014
Boxer briefs.

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:30.645
Oh I couldn't make up my mind.

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:32.109
Loose'em.

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:40.585
Where is it?

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:43.496
- That's it? Isn't it?
- No, no, no, that's a smudge.

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:47.963
Mama squirrel loves nuts.

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:51.671
Oh you do.

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:54.135
Bark like a dog.

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:55.704
- What?
- Bark!

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:58.245
Louder!

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:04.047
Meow like a pussycat.

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:07.054
And what does the cow say?

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:09.655
The says Moo. The cow says Moo!

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:11.558
Are you ready tiger?

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:15.720
Yes, yes. It's great!

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:17.560
Oh my god!

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:19.968
Is she going to...

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:24.132
Yes she is!

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.510
I am honored to be speaking
in front of you today.

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:41.323
I am particularly
grateful to provostalious

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:43.685
and the other Virgin Mary
administrators

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:46.054
for making time in their very busy
schedules to be here today.

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.193
Thank you.

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:50.298
Through out my tenure
at Sterling College,

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:55.195
I am most proud of how
I fought for equal gender rights.

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:57.970
Although I did not achieved
the level of success

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:00.837
I had hope with my most
recent project.

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:04.012
The rehabilitation
of Sterling College's

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:08.308
most notorious
and disrespected fraternity.

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:12.254
I swear to you
on my nana's graves

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.981
I will continue the gender fight

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:19.052
until I have serviced the needs
of every female student.

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.292
That is so gross.

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:23.163
That proffer my resignation

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:25.832
as Associate Dean
at Sterling College...

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.193
You guys ready?

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:33.267
...And accept the position
of Dean of Virgin Mary University.

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:34.575
Drop it.

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.976
Like it's hot. Roll it.

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:44.881
Proto status. I...

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:47.079
He's not gonna like this.

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:49.952
As well as inserting my rigid ethics

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:51.388
in the lives of your most
impressive student body.

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:53.357
- It's him right?
- Yeah. That's him.

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.122
Now ah...

01:18:57.999 --> 01:18:59.592
What is... I'm sorry...
Hello.

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.937
No! No! That is not me.

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:05.536
That is.
It's photoshoped people.

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:07.538
- Oh mommy.
- Thanks for coming.

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.305
Turn this off please.

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:14.083
Please somebody
tell me which one does it!

01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:16.707
Turn it off!

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:20.551
Marshall please.
Don't! Don't please.

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:23.157
It's not me.

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:25.350
Save it Marshall.

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:27.656
You're not who
we thought you were.

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:29.998
There's no place for you
at Virgin Mary College after all.

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:31.358
Furry freak...

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:32.828
Wait a minute... you can't...

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:35.160
Tiger Rosenbush?

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.402
Hey can I get a copy of that?

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:40.741
Great job.

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:47.410
Alpha House!

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:54.055
Today we reenter an elite
brotherhood...

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:56.517
and sisterhood,

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:01.055
Are we ready to uphold
the traditions of this fraternity...

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:04.724
I mean fraternasorority.

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:08.931

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:10.833
Yeah!

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.975
And do we pledge
no matter what,

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:16.040
to never let her hallowed halls
fall silent.

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:19.104
To never let the kegs go dry.

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.011
And to never...

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:24.643
ever, let the party die.

01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:28.987
If you're with me let me hear
you say fuck yeah.

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:31.792
Fuck yeah!

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:38.097
Welcome back.

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:41.961
To the 24 hour party machine!

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.271
Alpha House!

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.675
They're not back in 5 minutes
I'm putting my clothes back on.

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:01.984
I have to say when I told you guys
to find some dirt...

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:05.117
I wasn't expecting this.

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:07.920
Well sir it was a full team effort.

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:09.528
Without everybody involved,

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:11.398
never would have happened.

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.732
I have some fond memories
of this place.

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:20.639
Thowin' back brooze.
Banging tang.

01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:25.307
Hell I was the Alpha Male
3 years running.

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.607
Sometimes wish
I could come back.

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:30.942
Sir you're always welcome back.

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.421
Once and Alpha always an Alpha.

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.253
I may just take you up on that.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.550
Chuckie get over here,

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:42.022
Tracie is showing us
what she learned in Mexico

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.194
while standing. Come on!

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:45.692
Excuse us.

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:51.370
- Have a great party.
- Thank you Sir.

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:57.245
You know I was thinking...

01:21:57.512 --> 01:22:01.005
- Where you?
- Yeah I was thinking we could uh,

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:05.719
You know. Again.
Unless you're still mad at me.

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:07.013
- Lets go.
- Okay.

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:08.589
Excuse me girls.

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:18.898
Don't slam the door on my face.

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:22.571
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because I brought you these.

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:28.810
You wanna come in?

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:31.001
Sure.

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:38.746
So what do you want?

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.857
Uh, I just...

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:43.981
I know you don't like me
very much

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:45.956
but since we are officially
now roommates...

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:47.885
- House mates.
- Right.

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:51.163
I figured
that we should start fresh.

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:56.032

of an asshole but...

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:58.737

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:00.969

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:02.809
Turn around.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:10.074
Bang-o-rang.

01:23:11.853 --> 01:23:12.877
You're an asshole.

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.351
President asshole.

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:16.450
But I don't hate you.

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:18.649
Oh! Apparently not.

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:22.090

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:23.699

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:28.428

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:30.566
Sady Saltaire

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.033

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:43.111

You want a nut? Hmm?

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:09.978
