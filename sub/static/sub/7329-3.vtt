00:43.177 --> 00:44.755
There you are.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.390
It's about time.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.491
What took so long?

00:47.515 --> 00:48.859
You know I need my coffee
in the morning.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.360
Well, next time, go yourself.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.896
I was embarrassed ordering
a nonfat, extra-foamy,

00:52.920 --> 00:54.464
added-shot hazelnut latte.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.633
Crew's going to be here
in ten minutes.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.868
This thing going to be running?

00:57.892 --> 00:58.869
We're already two days behind.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.093
We don't need any more delays.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.510
Well, I don't understand.

01:40.534 --> 01:41.967
Was something wrong?

01:43.003 --> 01:46.750
Um... okay.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.151
Sure, Wednesday will be fine.

01:48.175 --> 01:49.820
Can we do it earlier than later?

01:49.844 --> 01:51.621
Great... 9:00.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.291
Thank you.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.459
Strange.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.494
Is that for our benefit, McGee?

01:57.518 --> 01:58.795
We supposed to ask what's wrong?

01:58.819 --> 02:00.063
That was Polygraph.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.431
I have to take another test.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.266
You took your annual last week.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.001
They want me to retake it.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.838
You failed your polygraph?
That's not good.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.906
No, I didn't fail it.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.242
They said I have
to take it again.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.927
Why would you have
to take it again?

02:14.935 --> 02:17.047
Don't ask, don't tell.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.715
You didn't make the mistake
of coming out, did you?

02:18.739 --> 02:20.784
I don't have anything
to come out about.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.968
Stick to that story, McQueen.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.555
It has to be
some kind of mistake.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.457
I'm sure it is nothing.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.126
This could be a career-ender.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.994
You better figure out
what you did wrong,

02:31.018 --> 02:32.018
how you screwed up.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.565
Hey, boss, you ever fail
your polygraph?

02:35.589 --> 02:37.567
Nope, never took one.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.102
Come on, got a dead body.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.270
- Marine?
- Nope.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.625
- Sailor?
- Nope.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.241
Blogger.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.675
Matt Burns.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.444
The pond scum who's been

02:47.468 --> 02:48.578
kicking our ass on the Internet?

02:48.602 --> 02:49.679
What happened to him?

02:49.703 --> 02:51.466
Don't know,
but we're going to find out.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.050
Hey, Duck, you need me?

02:54.074 --> 02:55.619
It looks as if you're busy.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.320
- It can wait.
- I'll check with you when I get back.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.902
Anything I can do from here?

03:01.382 --> 03:04.628
You still haven't been
cleared for fieldwork?

03:04.652 --> 03:06.997
I'm still waiting
for my status to be clarified.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.598
Oh, sorry to hear that.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.734
That would really make me mad.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.869
Well, how about you?

03:12.893 --> 03:16.864
Are you asking as a friend
or a forensic psychologist?

03:18.866 --> 03:21.278
Yeah, after what you've
been through,

03:21.302 --> 03:23.046
it must be really hard
to readjust.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.614
Especially bound to that desk.

03:24.638 --> 03:29.166
But if you feel like talking,
you know where to find me.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.338
Thanks, Duck.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.865
Get all of it.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.067
Got a print there, huh?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.603
You're NCIS.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.117
Yeah.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.867
- Nice scarf.
- Huh?

04:29.403 --> 04:31.381
Oh...

04:31.405 --> 04:33.016
Really brings out
the color of your eyes.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.484
Thank you.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.553
You shouldn't be wearing it
at a crime scene.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.442
Loose fibers.
You contaminated the vehicle.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.793
Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.463
Detective, uh... Megan Hanley.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.831
It's your first crime scene?

04:47.855 --> 04:49.332
Yeah, it's a rookie mistake.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.134
We all made them.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.278
This is Special Agent Gibbs.
This is Detective Hanley.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.872
Matt Burns' death may be related

04:55.896 --> 04:57.574
to a case we're working on.
What can you tell us?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.476
Uh, not much at this point.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.011
We know that he fell
over the bridge

05:01.035 --> 05:02.445
a little after 6:00 a.m.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.347
He almost landed
on some city workers.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.915
He jump or was he pushed?

05:05.939 --> 05:07.050
They didn't see what happened,

05:07.074 --> 05:08.918
but we did find a shoe print

05:08.942 --> 05:11.021
that doesn't match the victim,
near the railing where he fell.

05:11.045 --> 05:13.890
Boss, this is Detective
Sportelli, Metro Police.

05:13.914 --> 05:14.958
He's in charge.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.559
Special Agent Gibbs.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.346
This is a little awkward.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.031
Detective Hanley?

05:21.055 --> 05:22.365
Do you know they're from NCIS?

05:22.389 --> 05:24.768
- Yeah.
- What did you tell them?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.870
I was just filling them in
on what we know so far.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.772
Which doesn't sound
like much, Detective.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.341
You ran the I.D. on the vic.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.476
What did you say
he did for a living?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.912
Uh, he writes the blog.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.614
He's Beltway Burns.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.516
He was trashing NCIS.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.950
Said they were involved
in a cover-up

05:40.974 --> 05:42.719
of a naval officer's death.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.954
I wouldn't believe everything
I read on the 'Net.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.956
We're trying to tie up a case.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.560
Be nice to know
if the deaths were connected.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.797
I have to maintain the integrity
of this crime scene, Gibbs.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.199
I expect your cooperation.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.535
That includes investigating

05:58.559 --> 06:01.255
the possibility
of an NCIS cover-up.

06:12.172 --> 06:16.852
Lieutenant Rod Arnett
was a poster boy for the Navy.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.088
A scion of
New England bluebloods

06:19.112 --> 06:22.024
and a star quarterback
at Annapolis.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.093
His tragic death

06:24.117 --> 06:26.696
at the age of 26
in a weekend car crash

06:26.720 --> 06:29.165
on the Pax River
Naval Air Station was

06:29.189 --> 06:33.102
investigated by Naval Criminal
Investigative Service,

06:33.126 --> 06:34.337
which was quick...

06:34.361 --> 06:36.772
to declare the death
an accident.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.375
It was an accident. Jackass.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.744
My source
from within the Pentagon says

06:41.768 --> 06:45.114
NCIS is covering up
the true story.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.349
Lieutenant Arnett

06:46.373 --> 06:48.851
was involved in insider trading
from his position

06:48.875 --> 06:51.354
as a public affairs officer
in the Pentagon.

06:51.378 --> 06:54.323
I can't take any more
of this whack job.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.025
Go over everything we did
on the Arnett case.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.094
Think there's a link
between Arnett and Burns' death?

06:58.118 --> 06:59.428
You have to find out.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.931
You're not going to get
any help on this from Metro.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.799
Why do I get the feeling
that Gibbs and Sportelli

07:03.823 --> 07:04.934
are going to come to blows?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.369
Who is Sportelli?

07:06.393 --> 07:07.737
He's the police detective
who made the mistake

07:07.761 --> 07:09.805
of tugging on Superman's cape.

07:09.829 --> 07:13.376
Take a look at Burns' last post.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.144
"I'm about to meet a source

07:15.168 --> 07:17.580
who's going to blow
the story wide open."

07:17.604 --> 07:19.015
- Who's the source?
- I'm working on that.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.183
Back-trace Burns' IP address.

07:21.207 --> 07:24.520
This was sent through
a cell tower near the bridge

07:24.544 --> 07:26.022
at 5:45 a.m.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.990
- It's right before his death.
- Do you think.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.359
Burns was killed because he was
getting too close to the truth?

07:30.383 --> 07:31.594
Maybe he was knocked off

07:31.618 --> 07:33.162
by someone else
whose life he ruined.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.131
There's a lot of 'em.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.167
Judge Thomas Victor...
this is the one that put Burns

07:38.191 --> 07:40.069
- on the map.
- Because of Burns,

07:40.093 --> 07:42.738
the judge withdrew
his Supreme Court nomination?

07:42.762 --> 07:43.773
He destroyed the guy.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.741
Think I'll pay
the judge a visit.

07:45.765 --> 07:46.776
You be careful.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.844
We're investigating
Lieutenant Arnett.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.514
Burns is outside
the purview of our case.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.349
Ooh, "purview."

07:53.373 --> 07:55.093
Did big, bad Sportelli
scare you off, McGee?

08:05.351 --> 08:09.031
"Press power, then reset."

08:09.055 --> 08:12.535
Excuse me,
that's just what I did do.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.403
Got a new toy, Duck?

08:14.427 --> 08:16.105
Portable X-ray machine.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.473
It's going to be very useful

08:17.497 --> 08:19.742
if I can just get
the darn thing to work.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.644
You know, I'd like to have
a chat with the people

08:21.668 --> 08:23.079
that write
these instruction manuals,

08:23.103 --> 08:26.004
but I don't believe we have
a language in common.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.684
You wanted to see me.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.519
I wanted to check up on Ziva.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.456
She went through far more
than we suspected.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.692
I tried to draw her out,
but she doesn't want to talk.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.995
I was wondering...
has she said anything to you?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.509
No.

08:42.822 --> 08:45.968
She will when she's ready.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.670
Something else?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.805
Lieutenant Arnett.

08:49.829 --> 08:53.742
I need you to review
your autopsy file.

08:53.766 --> 08:55.945
Pressure from the director?

08:55.969 --> 08:58.214
Abby's reviewing
the physical evidence.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.172
Got to make sure we're right.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.586
So when'd you hear about Burns?

09:03.610 --> 09:05.754
This morning.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.556
Haven't stopped smiling since.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.258
Yeah, I can understand that.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.094
Before that rodent crawled
into my life,

09:12.118 --> 09:15.097
I was a respected
federal court judge,

09:15.121 --> 09:16.999
nominated to the Supreme Court.

09:17.023 --> 09:20.669
Now I teach business law
at community college.

09:20.693 --> 09:24.106
These kids can barely read,
let alone write... look at this.

09:24.130 --> 09:28.244
Who spells justice
J-U-S-T-I-S-S?

09:28.268 --> 09:31.046
Yeah.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.917
Burns accused you of plagiarism.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.051
Was that charge true?

09:36.075 --> 09:39.355
In preparing a speech,

09:39.379 --> 09:41.757
I borrowed some phrases
from a book I read.

09:41.781 --> 09:45.094
Burns called it plagiarism.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.096
And he was right.
What I did was stupid.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.298
But the nomination
could have survived it.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.467
But?

09:51.491 --> 09:53.936
Burns was looking
to make a name for himself.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.406
He accused me of infidelity,
taking kickbacks,

09:57.430 --> 10:00.042
even went so far as to say
I cheated in law school.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.278
They were fabricated charges
from unnamed sources.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.481
It became embarrassing to me.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.049
And to the administration.

10:07.073 --> 10:10.052
I withdrew my nomination.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.655
I'm gonna have to get back
to you about that. See you.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.190
Aren't you going
to ask me where I was

10:14.214 --> 10:15.658
this morning when Burns died?

10:15.682 --> 10:17.893
- I'll leave that to the Metro detectives.
- Hey!

10:17.917 --> 10:19.695
- What's his name?
- Agent DiNozzo.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.263
Hey, DiNozzo!

10:21.287 --> 10:22.331
What are you doing here?

10:22.355 --> 10:23.666
See ya!

10:23.690 --> 10:25.590
Get outta here!

10:27.193 --> 10:28.704
The minute I heard
about Matt Burns

10:28.728 --> 10:30.906
taking the header,
I knew you'd be

10:30.930 --> 10:32.329
calling us back in.

10:34.434 --> 10:38.427
Well, SECNAV is all over us
to clean this mess up.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.050
You were Arnett's C.O.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.219
You saw no hint

10:43.243 --> 10:44.553
of insider trading?

10:44.577 --> 10:46.188
It doesn't make sense.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.191
Why would Rod Arnett take
a chance at being caught?

10:49.215 --> 10:50.559
He had family money,

10:50.583 --> 10:52.928
unlimited future.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.130
He was young, drove
his sports car like a madman.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.999
It was a car accident.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.150
We're going to have
to dig deeper.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.472
Lieutenant Summers,
you were his project officer.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.974
Did you ever ride with him?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.141
Yes, sir.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.223
Once.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.045
He did drive pretty fast.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.982
What about Arnett's future?
Was it Navy?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.650
No. His tour was over
in a few months.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.454
He was fielding job offers
that Harvard MBAs would envy.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.422
- What about his social life?
- Don't know.

11:20.446 --> 11:22.224
Never saw him
outside the office.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.425
Lieutenant,

11:23.449 --> 11:25.327
you know who he was close with?

11:25.351 --> 11:26.462
Uh, not really.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.797
We talked in the office.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.899
But I have no idea
who his friends were

11:30.923 --> 11:32.151
or anything like that.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.072
Okay, explain to me
why we're doing this again?

11:37.096 --> 11:39.141
What exactly does Gibbs
expect me to find?

11:39.165 --> 11:41.143
You know Susan Grady
in Polygraph, right?

11:41.167 --> 11:43.846
Yeah. I did-I did
a metal stress test

11:43.870 --> 11:46.715
on the steering wheel and the
suspension mechanism; Negative.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.350
The computer analysis
of the ECU,

11:48.374 --> 11:50.753
it recorded the vehicle pushing
6,500 RPMs

11:50.777 --> 11:52.755
at 110 miles per hour
when it rolled.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.723
Listen, you know Grady
well enough to call

11:54.747 --> 11:56.358
and find out
why I'm retaking the test?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.460
I already did a computer
accident reconstruction...

11:58.484 --> 12:00.229
I was truthful,
I was completely relaxed.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.430
Based on the skid marks

12:01.454 --> 12:02.631
and the position of the car...

12:02.655 --> 12:04.266
I was honest.
I have no reason to lie.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.768
- And the victim's body.
- Why would I lie?

12:05.792 --> 12:07.736
You're not listening to me.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.805
This was an accident.

12:09.829 --> 12:11.840
I guess we've determined that.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.710
But because
of that creepy dead blogger

12:14.734 --> 12:17.680
who was spreading dreadful lies
about us, we have to keep going

12:17.704 --> 12:21.317
over everything
that we've already done.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.987
Abby, Abby,
I'm really worried, okay?

12:25.011 --> 12:27.323
I've got to find out what's
going on with this polygraph.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.325
McGee, I'm sure it's nothing.

12:29.349 --> 12:33.619
Have you ever heard of an agent
having to retake their test?

12:34.620 --> 12:36.699
Special Agent Kirschner.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.634
Kirschner?

12:38.658 --> 12:39.902
Yeah.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.738
He was gone before you got here.

12:42.762 --> 12:47.028
He was, um, he was let go.

12:50.536 --> 12:51.880
Your hunch was right.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.816
Going over Arnett's
phone records,

12:53.840 --> 12:56.985
I tracked an unusual number
of calls to and from.

12:57.009 --> 12:58.120
Lieutenant Jessica Summers.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.823
Based on the volume
and times of the calls,

13:00.847 --> 13:04.393
it suggests they were more
than just coworkers.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.129
Fraternization in the
workplace... never a good idea.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.131
The calls stopped abruptly
about a month ago.

13:09.155 --> 13:10.332
It's curious.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.934
Someone must have ended it.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.935
Why'd she lie?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.436
She said she hardly knew him.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.537
I'll make the call.

13:15.561 --> 13:17.172
Bringing in Lieutenant Summers.

13:17.196 --> 13:18.173
Tonight, DiNozzo.

13:18.197 --> 13:19.408
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.276
Um, there is something else
I want to show you.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.046
I had nothing else to do,
so I started going through.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.781
Beltway Burns' video archives.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.651
A lot of the facts in the
stories he has run are made up.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.186
This is from July 23 last year.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.322
He was doing a piece
on a congressman.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.623
As a result
of an exhaustive investigation,

13:34.647 --> 13:37.659
yesterday morning
I met in Atlanta with a member

13:37.683 --> 13:41.130
of the congressman's staff
who told me of the assignation.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.466
- That is total salami.
- Baloney.

13:44.490 --> 13:49.171
At the time, Burns claimed
to be in Atlanta,

13:49.195 --> 13:51.874
but his credit card records show
that he was in DC,

13:51.898 --> 13:55.310
at the Willard Hotel bar
having martinis.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.147
McGee.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.482
Yeah, boss?

14:00.506 --> 14:01.950
Lieutenant Arnett's finances...

14:01.974 --> 14:05.487
Well, his brokerage accounts
only show transactions

14:05.511 --> 14:07.055
from family trusts,

14:07.079 --> 14:09.258
and his one bank account
has the deposits

14:09.282 --> 14:11.894
from his Navy lieutenant's
salary and nothing else.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.596
If he had contact with
any other financial institution,

14:14.620 --> 14:16.417
I can't find it.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.750
You lied.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.819
All right, so you know
about Lieutenant Arnett and me.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.420
What else do you want me to say?

14:38.444 --> 14:42.424
Who broke it off?

14:42.448 --> 14:43.506
Me.

14:46.752 --> 14:51.700
Rod... because he was seeing
other women,

14:51.724 --> 14:53.535
and I found out.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.970
Can I go now?

14:54.994 --> 14:57.072
Sit.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.073
No way, honey bunny.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.223
He's not through with you.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.711
She knows more
than she's telling.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.413
- I agree with you.
- So what do you think?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.815
How's he gonna break her down?
What's the style?

15:06.839 --> 15:07.916
He's leading
with the Creepy Uncle,

15:07.940 --> 15:08.984
but I think he's gonna go

15:09.008 --> 15:10.686
with the Father Figure
You Can Trust.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.488
No, that doesn't feel right.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.189
I am gonna go with the classic.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.892
In Your Face Gibbs,
The Intimidator.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.009
- I don't think so.
- No.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.196
You should know
that we're working

15:21.220 --> 15:22.551
very closely with Metro Police.

15:24.323 --> 15:28.904
They have given us
complete access

15:28.928 --> 15:30.606
to their files

15:30.630 --> 15:33.675
and anything that they have
on Matt Burns.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.878
The old You Lie To Me,
I Lie To You.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.079
Didn't see that coming.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.080
I like it.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.648
We found notes in Burns' office

15:39.672 --> 15:41.503
with your name on 'em.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.077
Are you his Pentagon source?

15:48.748 --> 15:51.593
And now our little bunny rabbit
doesn't know what to say.

15:51.617 --> 15:55.731
He swore no one
would ever find out.

15:55.755 --> 15:58.591
Yeah, well, he lied.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.604
Why'd you go to Matt Burns?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.840
I was hurt.

16:04.864 --> 16:07.543
Rod had dumped me.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.512
Wasn't returning
my phone calls...

16:10.536 --> 16:13.596
Arnett was trading
on insider information?

16:16.409 --> 16:19.621
I think so.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.510
You think?!

16:22.848 --> 16:24.159
I re...

16:24.183 --> 16:27.629
I remember...

16:27.653 --> 16:29.598
the day after the press release

16:29.622 --> 16:32.100
of the McAllister Industries
contract,

16:32.124 --> 16:33.468
Rod came over with champagne.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.304
And when I asked
what was going on,

16:35.328 --> 16:37.806
he said that he had...
he had made a lot of money

16:37.830 --> 16:39.942
in the stock market.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.594
I could read between the lines.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.882
She just connected
the two cases.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.917
Arnett's death is looking
less like an accident.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.719
Maybe Burns was onto something.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.439
Which means
we blew the investigation.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.833
I reviewed
Lieutenant Arnett's autopsy

17:04.857 --> 17:07.935
as if I were
an objective outsider.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.105
First the photographs,
then the X-rays;

17:10.128 --> 17:12.140
I brought in
a radiological consultant

17:12.164 --> 17:14.843
and had Abby redo
the blood and tox tests.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.944
What's more...

17:15.968 --> 17:17.244
Duck, bottom line?

17:17.269 --> 17:18.512
Certainly.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.748
Uh, uh...

17:19.771 --> 17:24.086
Lieutenant Arnett's
death was accidental.

17:24.109 --> 17:26.188
Multiple traumas
sustained in a car accident.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.521
Oh,

17:27.546 --> 17:29.024
I think you're gonna want me
to take this.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.759
It's my counterpart
Tom Hubbard...

17:30.783 --> 17:33.762
the District M. E...
returning my call.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.497
Hello, Tom.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.100
Well, actually,
I'm in the middle of an autopsy.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.836
I have to say that
or he'll talk my ears off.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.005
What's that?

17:43.029 --> 17:44.473
Metropolitan Police...

17:44.497 --> 17:46.575
have classified Burns' death
as a homicide?

17:46.599 --> 17:49.177
Oh, thanks,

17:49.201 --> 17:51.880
I owe you one.
No, no, no, no, no, old boy,

17:51.904 --> 17:54.416
my lips are sealed.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.585
You ever lie like that
to me, Duck?

17:56.609 --> 17:59.121
Never.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.090
If the cases are connected,
does that infer

18:02.114 --> 18:03.792
that Arnett was also murdered?

18:03.816 --> 18:05.227
We got our hands full.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.062
Anything else you can do?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.630
Well, if I'd retained
Arnett's brain,

18:08.654 --> 18:12.034
I could perform
further toxicology tests.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.769
Why didn't you?

18:13.793 --> 18:15.203
Well, at the time,
it wasn't warranted.

18:15.227 --> 18:16.605
It was a car accident.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.541
Look, for the tests,
the tissue has to be prepared.

18:19.565 --> 18:21.209
It takes ten days.

18:21.233 --> 18:24.613
Th-The Arnett family was putting
pressure on the director.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.081
They wanted the body for burial,

18:26.105 --> 18:27.983
and they wanted it intact.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.584
- Unbury it.
- Jethro...

18:29.608 --> 18:30.919
Ducky, we need it now.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.953
Get the director involved.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.622
Use the full extent
of his office

18:33.646 --> 18:35.238
to get the consent
of the family.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.864
How you doing?
Special Agent Gibbs and DiNozzo.

18:42.888 --> 18:43.899
Sit down.

18:43.923 --> 18:44.933
Thank you.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.234
Benjamin Franklin,

18:46.258 --> 18:47.669
Securities and Exchange
Commission.

18:47.693 --> 18:52.140
I know, I don't look
like an SEC investigator.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.642
Is that really your name?

18:53.666 --> 18:57.179
Yes, and I've heard
every imaginable joke,

18:57.203 --> 18:59.147
so spare me.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.250
Now, we've been receiving
the same kind of heat

19:02.274 --> 19:04.186
you guys have since
Beltway Burns broke the story.

19:04.210 --> 19:07.089
I headed the investigation
of Arnett.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.824
If he was inside trading,

19:08.848 --> 19:10.158
we couldn't find
any evidence of it.

19:10.182 --> 19:11.426
How's it usually work?

19:11.450 --> 19:13.462
Well, when a company is awarded

19:13.486 --> 19:16.331
a multibillion-dollar defense
contract, its stock spikes.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.533
If anyone has advance knowledge,
like Arnett did,

19:18.557 --> 19:20.435
they'd purchase an OTM;

19:20.459 --> 19:22.404
That's an
"out of the money" call.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.072
That's taking a bet
that the stock

19:24.096 --> 19:26.208
will rise, and it only costs
pennies on a share.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.722
A penny saved is a penny earned.

19:29.435 --> 19:30.679
Yes.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.749
Now, we checked out
all the defense contracts

19:33.773 --> 19:36.051
released by CHINFO
in the past 12 months

19:36.075 --> 19:37.819
that Arnett was in the office.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.223
There was only one OTM that
showed any substantial profit.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.924
You got a name?

19:42.948 --> 19:44.860
Yes.

19:44.884 --> 19:45.884
Nice bifocals, Ben.

19:49.421 --> 19:52.968
An individual named Will Sutton.

19:52.992 --> 19:56.371
Now, he made $2 million
on McAllister Industries stock.

19:56.395 --> 19:57.806
What do we know about him, Ben?

19:57.830 --> 20:00.242
Doesn't make any sense.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.378
He owns a small sandwich shop
in the Adams Morgan district.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.280
We've had the guy
under a microscope,

20:05.304 --> 20:06.948
but we can't find a connection

20:06.972 --> 20:09.017
between him, Arnett, the Navy,

20:09.041 --> 20:10.976
or any other source
of inside information.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.258
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Gibbs,

20:16.282 --> 20:17.526
I need you to come down here.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.814
Okay, Abbs, slow down,
I'll be right there.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.981
Get the information on Sutton.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.737
Oh, dear.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.872
I only take orders
from one person:

20:30.896 --> 20:33.775
Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

20:33.799 --> 20:37.579
Unless he asks me to do it,
it doesn't get done.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.400
I think
that's gonna change, honey.

20:41.106 --> 20:43.952
Gibbs, make this awful man
go away.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.121
What do you want, Sportelli?

20:46.145 --> 20:48.256
All the physical evidence
from the Arnett investigation,

20:48.280 --> 20:49.791
including the car.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.994
We're denied access
to your investigation,

20:53.018 --> 20:55.463
and you get
all the evidence in ours?

20:55.487 --> 20:58.923
Since I have
a court order... yes.

21:10.135 --> 21:11.159
Give it to him, Abbs.

21:15.741 --> 21:18.386
You're gonna have to sign
the chain of evidence, honey.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.610
You know what? I'll take that.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.659
I hope you can look
your boss in the eye

21:24.683 --> 21:26.810
and tell him you didn't blow
this investigation.

21:27.853 --> 21:30.031
- Hanley?
- Coming.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.716
Here you go.

21:33.592 --> 21:35.170
Ugh!

21:35.194 --> 21:38.173
I can understand
the SEC asking me questions.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.841
Why the Navy?

21:39.865 --> 21:41.743
We're looking into the death
of a Navy officer,

21:41.767 --> 21:42.878
Mr. Sutton.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.512
What's that got to do with me?

21:44.536 --> 21:46.982
You made a killing
on McAllister Industries' stock

21:47.006 --> 21:48.216
right after they were awarded

21:48.240 --> 21:49.918
a multibillion-dollar
defense contract,

21:49.942 --> 21:51.419
and the officer whose death

21:51.443 --> 21:53.188
we're investigating
may have been involved

21:53.212 --> 21:55.190
- in insider trading, so...
- I get lucky

21:55.214 --> 21:57.792
on one legitimate investment,
and everybody's all over me.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.327
You know, if I had lost money,

21:59.351 --> 22:00.495
nobody would give a damn.

22:00.519 --> 22:01.897
I got a box
full of losing lottery tickets.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.365
Would you like
to take a look at it?

22:03.389 --> 22:06.635
No. So you've never met or heard
of Lieutenant Rod Arnett?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.436
- Nope.
- Let me ask you a question.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.439
If you made two million bucks
in the market,

22:11.463 --> 22:13.575
what are you doing
making sandwiches?

22:13.599 --> 22:17.345
'Cause the SEC froze my funds

22:17.369 --> 22:20.248
until after they finish
their investigation.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.217
They haven't found anything,
they never will.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.486
I tell you,
I catch one lucky break,

22:24.510 --> 22:26.221
it turns into a nightmare.

22:26.245 --> 22:28.957
I've had to hire a lawyer...
the guy's costing me a fortune.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.381
He's gonna see more money
on this than I will.

22:32.851 --> 22:36.164
That pastrami looks great.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.867
You know how many connections
I have found

22:38.891 --> 22:41.703
between Arnett and Sutton? Zero.

22:41.727 --> 22:43.571
I've checked everything.

22:43.595 --> 22:45.859
I have checked e-mails,
I have checked phone records...

22:48.200 --> 22:49.177
Is that pastrami?

22:49.201 --> 22:50.912
Mm-hmm.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.614
- Can I have a bite?
- Uh-uh.

22:52.638 --> 22:54.149
This is my dinner.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.850
You can have the pickle.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.319
I don't like pickles.

22:57.343 --> 22:58.605
I know.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.191
These two guys couldn't be
more different.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.194
One was a rich kid, the other
dropped out of high school

23:06.218 --> 23:09.264
to support his...
invalid mother.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.765
He makes a mean sandwich.

23:10.789 --> 23:13.134
We got Arnett.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.503
Academy graduate,

23:15.527 --> 23:16.805
single playboy, jock,

23:16.829 --> 23:18.540
part of the DC social scene.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.108
Now, you've got Sutton:

23:20.132 --> 23:23.211
Married 15 years,
three kids, two mortgages.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.747
Can't afford to live
in the city,

23:25.771 --> 23:28.416
so he takes the train
each day... an hour.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.136
Come on, man, you know
I didn't have lunch today.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.693
These two live 60 miles apart.

23:38.717 --> 23:40.628
There is no discernible way

23:40.652 --> 23:44.165
they have met or have
anything in common.

23:44.189 --> 23:46.350
I hope you choke on that.

23:51.897 --> 23:55.944
You know, disinterment is
considered a sacrilege or taboo

23:55.968 --> 23:58.346
by certain cultures,
especially the ones

23:58.370 --> 23:59.948
who bury their dead.

23:59.972 --> 24:03.918
Gibbs thinks this is
a necessary exception.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.254
In Southern China, for example,

24:06.278 --> 24:10.225
graves are opened
after a period of one year.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.926
The bones are removed,

24:11.950 --> 24:15.997
cleaned, dried, and put
in a ceramic pot for reburial.

24:16.021 --> 24:19.300
The process is called jiangu.

24:19.324 --> 24:22.170
Exhumations are... disturbing.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.238
They are.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.607
Fortunately Lieutenant Arnett

24:25.631 --> 24:27.098
has only been buried
for two weeks.

24:41.447 --> 24:43.892
Who would want to steal
Arnett's body?

24:43.916 --> 24:46.461
I don't know, but thank
God Matt Burns isn't around

24:46.485 --> 24:48.063
to put it in his blog.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.764
Someone else will fill the void.

24:49.788 --> 24:50.765
This is really

24:50.789 --> 24:52.100
gonna give
the conspiracy theorists

24:52.124 --> 24:54.002
a reason to believe
we're covering up a murder.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.337
It's gonna get worse
after I tell Sportelli.

24:56.361 --> 24:57.672
Ugh, do you have to?

24:57.696 --> 25:00.008
Duck, when was the last time
you saw Arnett's body?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.509
The day after I did the autopsy.

25:01.533 --> 25:03.011
We released it

25:03.035 --> 25:06.232
to the... Heavenly Glen
Funeral Home in Falls Church.

25:07.272 --> 25:08.349
They picked it up.

25:08.373 --> 25:09.350
DiNozzo, McGee.

25:09.374 --> 25:11.319
On it, boss.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.822
Boss, I'm scheduled to retake
that polygraph at 9:00 a.m.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.590
- I'll handle it.
- Thanks.

25:15.614 --> 25:16.724
Treat this like

25:16.748 --> 25:18.739
- a crime scene, Abbs.
- Right.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.501
I'm looking
for Special Agent Timothy McGee.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.670
He is out of the building
on assignment.

25:28.694 --> 25:33.341
Tell him Agent Grady
from Polygraph wants to see him.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.376
He missed his scheduled
appointment this morning.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.459
I will make sure
he gets the message.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.253
We picked up
Lieutenant Arnett's remains

25:45.277 --> 25:46.888
from NCIS at 11:20

25:46.912 --> 25:48.523
on the sixth of last month.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.991
He was brought directly here,

25:50.015 --> 25:51.593
where our mortician
did a reconstruction

25:51.617 --> 25:52.861
of the deceased's face,

25:52.885 --> 25:54.329
which...

25:54.353 --> 25:56.664
was severely damaged
in the accident.

25:56.688 --> 25:59.701
We know. We worked the scene.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.836
Well, that evening, Arnett's
immediate family had a viewing.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.072
I thought our mortician

26:04.096 --> 26:05.473
did a wonderful job,

26:05.497 --> 26:07.876
but they decided to have
the casket closed

26:07.900 --> 26:08.877
for the funeral.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.545
It was sealed at 10:00 p.m.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.447
The mortuary closed at 11:00

26:12.471 --> 26:15.350
and did not open
until 7:00 the next morning.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.685
How was the casket delivered
to Arlington?

26:17.709 --> 26:18.987
In our hearse...

26:19.011 --> 26:20.588
first to the chapel,
then to the graveside service.

26:20.612 --> 26:23.691
Any idea how the body
could have been removed?

26:23.715 --> 26:24.759
None.

26:24.783 --> 26:27.061
- Who else has keys to the building?
- Myself,

26:27.085 --> 26:29.697
my brother, who is also
my partner in the business,

26:29.721 --> 26:31.566
and... our mortician.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.034
No one else?

26:33.058 --> 26:34.821
Hmm.

26:37.496 --> 26:39.207
Uh, is there a security system?

26:39.231 --> 26:41.096
Of course.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.796
Excuse me for a second.

26:49.841 --> 26:51.786
I got a text from Ziva.

26:51.810 --> 26:52.887
Gunmetal metal.

26:52.911 --> 26:55.190
Nice.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.158
The polygraph examiner
is looking for me.

26:57.182 --> 26:58.226
Ouch.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.394
I guess Gibbs forgot.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.262
He's got a lot on his mind.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.897
Hey, come over here
for a second.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.966
Come here.

27:04.990 --> 27:05.990
I got an idea.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.077
What?

27:16.101 --> 27:17.145
Hop in.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.413
What are you talking about?

27:18.437 --> 27:20.381
- Just do it.
- Why would I do that?

27:20.405 --> 27:21.583
I take your picture,

27:21.607 --> 27:23.851
we send it to Polygraph,
they think you're dead,

27:23.875 --> 27:25.587
you don't have
to retake the test.

27:25.611 --> 27:26.988
Tony, that is not funny.

27:27.012 --> 27:28.423
They already think
you're ducking them.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.847
It's only going to get worse.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.930
I had totally forgotten
about this,

27:35.954 --> 27:38.199
but early on the morning
of the seventh,

27:38.223 --> 27:39.667
the security alarm went off.

27:39.691 --> 27:42.237
I was notified at home
and met the patrol here.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.605
This is their report.

27:43.629 --> 27:47.008
We searched the entire building
but found nothing missing.

27:47.032 --> 27:49.744
Dismissed the incident
as a faulty alarm.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.546
It went off at 2:10 a.m.

27:51.570 --> 27:54.148
Security arrived
on-site at 2:30 a.m.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.416
There's a 20-minute window

27:55.440 --> 27:58.932
where someone could have removed
Arnett's body.

28:00.445 --> 28:01.856
This coffin looks expensive.

28:01.880 --> 28:02.857
It is.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.158
It's top of the line.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.760
But it's... it's new.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.128
You know, factory-made.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.763
It has no personality.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.331
Mine, on the other hand,

28:10.355 --> 28:12.600
is like a Stradivarius...
hand-crafted

28:12.624 --> 28:15.637
by a Bavarian artisan
circa 1870.

28:15.661 --> 28:17.805
It never made sense to me
to spend a fortune

28:17.829 --> 28:20.208
on something that's gonna be
viewed for a couple of hours

28:20.232 --> 28:22.744
and then stuck
in the ground to rot.

28:22.768 --> 28:25.179
Mine has and will continue
to provide me

28:25.203 --> 28:28.283
with hours
of restful sleep and pleasure.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.651
Did you find anything?

28:29.675 --> 28:31.452
- Prints, DNA?
- Nada.

28:31.476 --> 28:32.987
In fact, all four plates

28:33.011 --> 28:35.490
were meticulously cleaned
with acetate.

28:35.514 --> 28:36.858
How strange.

28:36.882 --> 28:40.395
Why would someone take
such precautions

28:40.419 --> 28:43.364
if the coffin was going
to be buried for all eternity?

28:43.388 --> 28:45.566
Ducky, this is cosmic.

28:45.590 --> 28:47.068
Two minds, one thought...

28:47.092 --> 28:51.005
that is exactly what Gibbs said
when I told him.

28:51.029 --> 28:53.007
Wow.

28:53.031 --> 28:55.810
Burns pushed for the Arnett case
to remain open

28:55.834 --> 28:57.745
by saying we made a mistake.

28:57.769 --> 29:00.715
He knew we would eventually be
forced to exhume Arnett's body

29:00.739 --> 29:03.184
to prove his death
was accidental.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.987
And when it was found missing,
his blog site would explode.

29:06.011 --> 29:06.988
And Burns would become
a celebrity,

29:07.012 --> 29:09.023
a regular on Anderson Cooper.

29:09.047 --> 29:10.091
After that, Burns could say

29:10.115 --> 29:11.926
anything he wanted to
about Arnett.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.761
Dead man cannot defend himself.

29:13.785 --> 29:15.296
You think Burns stole the body.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.198
That is what makes
the most sense.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.434
I like it... how do we prove it?

29:19.458 --> 29:20.823
Boss, I got an idea.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.601
But I need to get a look
at Burns' car in police impound.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.131
Like Sportelli's going
to let us do that.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.379
Whoa.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.831
There it is.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.499
Well, I could take care

29:51.523 --> 29:53.835
of the video surveillance...
it's the canine patrol

29:53.859 --> 29:55.002
I'm worried about.

29:55.026 --> 29:56.571
Oh, chillax, bro.

29:56.595 --> 29:59.006
All these budget cuts
and economic problems,

29:59.030 --> 30:00.742
they can't afford dogs.

30:00.766 --> 30:01.994
Trust me.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.753
Are you sure
that thing's gonna work?

30:11.777 --> 30:15.556
Yeah, it's my own personal
concoction of oatmeal,

30:15.580 --> 30:16.791
mayonnaise, carpenter's glue.

30:16.815 --> 30:20.128
Perfectly simulates
bird droppings.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.096
Us grown-ups use
a different word for it.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.431
Used it very successfully

30:23.455 --> 30:25.633
in the Chesapeake team
paintball finals last summer.

30:25.657 --> 30:26.734
Paintball? Cool.

30:26.758 --> 30:27.969
All right, so that's

30:27.993 --> 30:30.405
the camera you want to hit
with your bird poop,

30:30.429 --> 30:32.761
McSniper.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.079
Ooh!

30:38.103 --> 30:39.614
Nice shot.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.849
I'm impressed.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.676
All right, let's go.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.459
What's the matter?

30:51.483 --> 30:53.144
You sure there's
no dogs in here?

30:54.186 --> 30:56.464
I don't see any dogs.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.000
I don't hear any dogs.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.201
So, no...

31:00.225 --> 31:01.202
there are no dogs!

31:01.226 --> 31:02.284
Come on.

31:05.063 --> 31:07.224
Do your thing.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.919
- All righty.
- Sure you're gonna fit in there?

31:17.943 --> 31:20.421
There you go. Nice.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.123
That's like a yoga position.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.391
This up here.

31:23.415 --> 31:24.625
That's like a...
upside-down manatee.

31:24.649 --> 31:25.927
Yeah.

31:25.951 --> 31:27.714
All right.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.669
All right...

31:34.693 --> 31:36.388
Doing it...

31:37.662 --> 31:38.706
Put this up here...

31:38.730 --> 31:40.374
All right, baby, come on.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.711
This'd be a lot easier
if I could pull the nav system

31:43.735 --> 31:45.613
and look at it in Abby's lab.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.882
Been a lot easier if Sportelli
had just given us the car.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.984
Well...

31:50.008 --> 31:52.533
Okay, downloading.

31:57.048 --> 31:58.917
That sounds like a dog.

32:00.151 --> 32:02.396
Oh, you're such an easy mark.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.853
You're such a child.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.560
All right, we got it.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.940
- Get my tools...
- Dogs, McGee.

32:12.964 --> 32:14.175
Dogs!

32:14.199 --> 32:15.543
Yeah, right.

32:15.567 --> 32:16.911
Real dogs!
Get out of here, McGee!

32:16.935 --> 32:18.412
Big dogs, big dogs!

32:18.436 --> 32:20.348
You said there weren't any dogs!

32:20.372 --> 32:22.183
Come on! Oh, God.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.442
McGee!

32:25.443 --> 32:26.774
Get to high ground!

32:30.448 --> 32:32.617
Heel! Heel!

32:34.052 --> 32:35.963
Oh! It's like Turner and Hooch!

32:35.987 --> 32:38.065
Or K-9 with Jim Belushi!

32:38.089 --> 32:40.635
Run away, McGee! Aah!

32:40.659 --> 32:43.905
Tony... Tony!

32:43.929 --> 32:45.740
- Oh, God!
- No, no, no...

32:45.764 --> 32:47.408
Down! Stay!

32:47.432 --> 32:48.943
Come on, Tim!

32:48.967 --> 32:51.367
I don't have
the right shoes for this!

32:55.307 --> 32:58.286
Over here! Come to the fence!

32:58.310 --> 32:59.921
Come on! Come on!

32:59.945 --> 33:01.947
Tony!

33:03.148 --> 33:04.992
Tony!

33:05.016 --> 33:07.094
There you go! Come on up!

33:07.118 --> 33:10.231
Got it.

33:10.255 --> 33:11.489
Tony!

33:13.625 --> 33:15.603
Freeze!

33:15.627 --> 33:16.719
Release, boy.

33:18.129 --> 33:19.240
Release!

33:19.264 --> 33:20.942
So close.

33:20.966 --> 33:22.109
I sent it to Abby.

33:22.133 --> 33:23.259
Well done.

33:38.777 --> 33:39.954
Where did you get those?

33:39.978 --> 33:41.122
Off links.

33:41.146 --> 33:42.757
Poor little Timmy...
he looks so scared.

33:42.781 --> 33:44.725
Why aren't you downtown
trying to bail them out?

33:44.749 --> 33:45.860
I don't trust Sportelli.

33:45.884 --> 33:47.061
They'll be fine, Abbs.

33:47.085 --> 33:49.263
They're probably
crammed in some cell

33:49.287 --> 33:50.865
where they're being
tormented by-by perverts

33:50.889 --> 33:51.966
and-and addicts and murderers...

33:51.990 --> 33:53.734
Did you analyze the data
from Burns' car?

33:53.758 --> 33:54.835
I did.

33:54.859 --> 33:57.104
It proves what Ziva suspected.

33:57.128 --> 34:00.107
Burns was parked outside
the mortuary from 2:05 a.m.

34:00.131 --> 34:01.208
until 2:19 a.m.

34:01.232 --> 34:02.443
Tony and McGee risked
their lives

34:02.467 --> 34:03.778
trying to get this information

34:03.802 --> 34:06.247
and you're just going to let
them rot in a jail cell?

34:06.271 --> 34:08.139
Where did Burns go
after the mortuary?

34:10.208 --> 34:11.485
Seneca Creek Park in Maryland.

34:11.509 --> 34:13.454
Thank you.

34:13.478 --> 34:15.089
You're out!

34:15.112 --> 34:16.257
Did you know?

34:16.281 --> 34:17.324
Director handled it.

34:17.348 --> 34:18.926
Way above my pay grade.

34:18.949 --> 34:20.027
Don't get too comfortable, boys.

34:20.051 --> 34:21.813
We got a search team
to organize.

34:45.076 --> 34:47.021
I just got a call from Tony.

34:47.045 --> 34:50.157
After searching all afternoon,
they found Arnett's body.

34:50.181 --> 34:51.725
Great.

34:51.748 --> 34:53.726
That's all you have to say?

34:53.751 --> 34:55.094
Your theory was right.

34:55.119 --> 34:56.664
Burns stole the body.

34:56.688 --> 34:59.033
I would be doing cartwheels
right now.

34:59.057 --> 35:00.201
Let's go celebrate.

35:00.225 --> 35:01.235
Let's get something to eat.

35:01.259 --> 35:03.370
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

35:03.394 --> 35:05.039
My friend's band is playing

35:05.063 --> 35:06.690
at the Filibuster
tonight in Georgetown.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.044
Come on.

35:10.068 --> 35:11.612
Girls' night out.

35:11.636 --> 35:12.728
It'll be fun.

35:14.272 --> 35:17.799
I have something
I have to do, Abby.

35:23.381 --> 35:26.043
Okay.

35:27.352 --> 35:28.512
See ya.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.185
I'm sorry I, uh, I missed
our appointment yesterday.

35:51.209 --> 35:53.754
I came in early just for you.

35:53.778 --> 35:55.689
Thanks.

35:55.713 --> 36:00.673
I've been, um... on a...
on a case, under pressure.

36:01.719 --> 36:04.131
You got me in trouble.

36:04.155 --> 36:06.367
I'm a creature of habit...

36:06.391 --> 36:08.769
I take the same train every day

36:08.793 --> 36:11.071
and the regulars gave me
a hard time this morning.

36:11.095 --> 36:14.141
They were worried when
they didn't see me yesterday.

36:14.165 --> 36:17.657
I need to make an adjustment.

36:37.855 --> 36:42.019
That got your...
blood pressure up.

36:44.896 --> 36:47.675
All right. Um, let's begin.

36:47.699 --> 36:50.144
I'm going to ask
several questions.

36:50.168 --> 36:52.179
Some will be
for control purposes

36:52.203 --> 36:53.881
and appear irrelevant.

36:53.905 --> 36:55.549
Uh, please answer all questions

36:55.573 --> 36:56.750
with a simple yes or no.

36:56.774 --> 36:58.285
Yes, ma'am.

36:58.309 --> 36:59.420
Is your name Timothy McGee?

36:59.444 --> 37:01.036
Yes.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.490
Were you born
in Bethesda, Maryland?

37:03.514 --> 37:04.658
Yes.

37:04.682 --> 37:06.627
Have you ever been arrested?

37:06.651 --> 37:07.761
No.

37:07.785 --> 37:11.131
Uh, yes. Uh...

37:11.155 --> 37:14.234
Yesterday. It was on the case.

37:14.258 --> 37:15.869
The director...

37:15.893 --> 37:16.870
Yes or no?

37:16.894 --> 37:19.707
Sorry, uh... uh, yes.

37:19.731 --> 37:22.309
Do you live alone?

37:22.333 --> 37:24.178
Yes.

37:24.202 --> 37:27.035
Are you
in a committed relationship?

37:30.074 --> 37:31.234
Uh, no.

37:34.078 --> 37:35.647
Okay.

37:37.382 --> 37:38.892
Have you ever used...

37:38.916 --> 37:41.061
- Hold on a second.
- What?

37:41.085 --> 37:44.498
You said that you take
the same train every morning?

37:44.522 --> 37:46.500
Uh, you don't get
to ask the questions.

37:46.524 --> 37:48.002
You ride with the same people?

37:48.026 --> 37:49.288
Yes.

37:50.395 --> 37:51.505
What are you doing?

37:51.529 --> 37:53.707
Why-Why-Why are you taking?

37:53.731 --> 37:55.609
Um, you can't... Um, excuse me.

37:55.633 --> 37:57.478
We're in the middle of an exam.

37:57.502 --> 37:58.764
I got to reschedule.

38:05.109 --> 38:06.553
So...

38:06.577 --> 38:09.223
the fibers on the uniform Arnett
was buried in are consistent

38:09.247 --> 38:11.058
with the trunk-liner carpeting
of the make and model

38:11.082 --> 38:12.059
of Burns' sedan.

38:12.083 --> 38:13.527
Now, if I could just get

38:13.551 --> 38:15.295
a look at the actual car.

38:15.319 --> 38:16.764
Abbs, I need to see
the inventory

38:16.788 --> 38:17.765
of Arnett's personal effects.

38:17.789 --> 38:18.799
Hey, boss.

38:18.823 --> 38:20.434
Got to know
if he had a rail pass.

38:20.458 --> 38:21.902
Yes.

38:21.926 --> 38:24.360
Did you record
the serial number?

38:25.563 --> 38:26.874
All right.

38:26.898 --> 38:29.243
Hey, McGee.

38:29.267 --> 38:32.479
Boss, we know that Lieutenant
Arnett had inside information

38:32.503 --> 38:34.782
on McAllister Industries'
stocks; We also know

38:34.806 --> 38:36.483
that Will Sutton made $2 million

38:36.507 --> 38:38.385
the day after
the contract was announced.

38:38.409 --> 38:40.421
The SEC tried to connect
both men, but they couldn't.

38:40.445 --> 38:42.690
What if they took the same train
to work every day?

38:42.714 --> 38:44.324
Thought they didn't live
anywhere near each other.

38:44.348 --> 38:45.459
They don't.

38:45.483 --> 38:48.662
Sutton drives
to the Shady Grove station

38:48.686 --> 38:51.265
every morning to take
the Red Line into the city

38:51.289 --> 38:53.200
to his sandwich shop.

38:53.224 --> 38:54.468
It's a 55-minute ride.

38:54.492 --> 38:55.903
Now, Arnett commutes
to the Pentagon by train.

38:55.927 --> 38:57.171
Gets on the Red Line
at Bethesda.

38:57.195 --> 38:59.773
If they were regulars
on the same train,

38:59.797 --> 39:01.008
they rode to work together
every morning.

39:01.032 --> 39:03.577
Okay. I accessed
the Metrorail data bank

39:03.601 --> 39:05.646
and I entered
Arnett's rail pass number.

39:05.670 --> 39:10.573
He boarded the Red Line at
Bethesda at 7:20 every morning.

39:11.876 --> 39:14.242
We need to get a look
at Will Sutton's rail pass.

39:30.294 --> 39:32.272
Hey.

39:32.296 --> 39:33.474
You brought a friend.

39:33.498 --> 39:34.808
Must have liked the pastrami.

39:34.832 --> 39:36.577
It was delicious.

39:36.601 --> 39:38.812
He's not my friend.

39:38.836 --> 39:40.147
You take the Metrorail

39:40.171 --> 39:42.716
to the city
through Shady Grove, right?

39:42.740 --> 39:43.717
Yeah.

39:43.741 --> 39:45.018
Yeah, we need to see
your rail pass.

39:45.042 --> 39:47.454
Why?

39:47.478 --> 39:49.790
- You a Hitchcock fan?
- Uh-uh.

39:49.814 --> 39:52.459
You ever see the 1951 classic
Strangers on a Train?

39:52.483 --> 39:54.027
Farley Granger, Robert Walker?

39:54.051 --> 39:57.131
They meet in a club car,
plot to exchange murders.

39:57.155 --> 39:59.146
"You kill my father,
I'll kill your wife."

39:59.991 --> 40:01.869
They believed
that no one would be able

40:01.893 --> 40:03.704
to connect them to each other.

40:03.728 --> 40:06.173
You and Arnett were regulars
on the same train.

40:06.197 --> 40:09.176
Got friendly; You came up
with the insider-trading scam.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.811
You knew
if the SEC investigated,

40:10.835 --> 40:12.713
they would never be able

40:12.737 --> 40:15.171
to connect you to each other.

40:18.176 --> 40:19.386
After a respectable amount
of time,

40:19.410 --> 40:21.355
you'd split
the $2 million profit.

40:21.379 --> 40:22.990
But you got lucky.

40:23.014 --> 40:24.491
Your partner died
in a car accident

40:24.515 --> 40:26.693
and you got to keep
all the money to yourself.

40:26.717 --> 40:29.930
You guys got
quite an imagination.

40:29.954 --> 40:31.598
How about you let us see
your rail pass?

40:31.622 --> 40:33.200
How about I call my lawyer?

40:33.224 --> 40:34.601
Innocent guys always say that.

40:34.625 --> 40:38.405
Your mistake was believing
Matt Burns' blog.

40:38.429 --> 40:40.207
He was bluffing.

40:40.231 --> 40:42.209
He only had a tip on Arnett.

40:42.233 --> 40:43.210
He made the rest up.

40:43.234 --> 40:44.444
But you bought it,

40:44.468 --> 40:46.780
you panicked; You thought
Burns was on to you.

40:46.804 --> 40:50.284
Anonymously contacted him,
said you had information,

40:50.308 --> 40:51.652
arranged to meet at the bridge.

40:51.676 --> 40:53.420
They're making all this up.

40:53.444 --> 40:54.922
Yeah?

40:54.946 --> 40:58.575
Our good friends at Metro PD are
working very closely with us.

41:01.552 --> 41:03.430
We've connected you to Arnett.

41:03.454 --> 41:04.698
Once we give them your name,

41:04.722 --> 41:06.202
they're going
to connect you to Burns.

41:08.726 --> 41:10.070
They're going to backtrack
every communication

41:10.094 --> 41:13.086
e-mails, phone calls, the lot.

41:16.133 --> 41:19.613
We wrapped the case for you,
Dan; Show some appreciation.

41:19.637 --> 41:21.682
I don't like the conditions.

41:21.706 --> 41:23.016
Come on.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.418
We're handing over the guy
who murdered Burns.

41:24.442 --> 41:26.602
Least you could do is drop
the charges against my team.

41:27.945 --> 41:30.209
If this case doesn't hold up,
deal's off.

41:32.383 --> 41:33.383
You got it.

41:34.585 --> 41:35.729
Take him.

41:35.753 --> 41:37.331
Hey, Hanley.

41:37.355 --> 41:39.023
I'll escort you down.

41:41.025 --> 41:42.369
Nice sweater.

41:42.393 --> 41:43.604
Where'd you get that?

41:43.628 --> 41:44.605
Stripes are nice.

41:44.629 --> 41:45.973
Boss...

41:45.997 --> 41:48.909
I better go down and reschedule
this polygraph test.

41:48.933 --> 41:51.144
Don't bother, McGee. Nothing
wrong with the first one.

41:51.168 --> 41:52.499
What do you mean?

41:54.839 --> 41:57.034
I think you made
an impression on the examiner.

41:59.010 --> 42:02.036
I think she made
an excuse to see you again.

42:03.848 --> 42:05.292
You want me
to draw you a picture?

42:05.316 --> 42:07.628
No.

42:07.652 --> 42:11.019
I'm gonna handle her, boss.

42:15.626 --> 42:18.405
Being stuck at that desk has
given me a lot of time to think.

42:18.429 --> 42:22.976
Being a visitor here is wrong.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.298
What does that mean, Ziva?

42:28.439 --> 42:29.983
I need your signature on this.

42:30.007 --> 42:33.170
I want to be an NCIS agent.

42:39.317 --> 42:41.979
I don't even know
if that's possible.

42:45.523 --> 42:47.768
You would have
to resign from Mossad.

42:47.792 --> 42:50.003
Already have.

42:50.027 --> 42:52.005
Sent my father an e-mail.

42:52.029 --> 42:53.941
Hmm. What's he think about that?

42:53.965 --> 42:55.660
Does not matter.
