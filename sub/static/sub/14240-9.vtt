What's this?

00:26.900 --> 00:29.700
That's an engagement ring, that is.

00:29.735 --> 00:30.900
You're getting married?

00:30.935 --> 00:32.817
Yes, Rhys asked.

00:32.852 --> 00:34.665
And you said yes?

00:34.700 --> 00:37.100
Well, no-one else will have me.

00:37.700 --> 00:41.300
I need stability, Jack,
someone I can rely on.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.700
Oh, it's the service she's meant
to be late for, not her hen do.

00:55.735 --> 00:57.617
Where is she?

00:57.652 --> 00:59.500
There she is!

01:00.700 --> 01:03.865
<i>o/~ Here comes the bride
looking for a ride...</i>

01:03.900 --> 01:07.700
<i>o/~ Here comes the bride and
she'll take it up the aisle!</i>

01:09.700 --> 01:11.100
Ey, thought you'd bottled it.

01:11.135 --> 01:12.500
No, I had a lot on at work.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.065
<i>Careful, Gwen...</i>

01:16.100 --> 01:18.100
this thing eats people.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.700
Oh, sorry, love, on your way.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.465
<i>Jack, It's a shape-shifter!</i>

01:46.500 --> 01:49.900
<i>He could look like anyone now,
but he's leaving a trail of black blood.</i>

01:52.900 --> 01:54.900
He's changed but it's definitely him.

01:54.935 --> 01:56.900
He's heading towards Trinity Street.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.700
So, is there anything to eat tonight,
or is it just booze all the way?

02:01.900 --> 02:05.100
Booze, blokes, bopping and booze!

02:05.135 --> 02:08.100
Gwen Cooper, you're nicked.

02:08.134 --> 02:09.699
Oh, no.

02:34.700 --> 02:35.665
This is such a bad idea.

02:35.700 --> 02:40.500
I'm getting married in like,
what, what... thirteen hours.

02:40.900 --> 02:41.900
Oh, look at me!

02:42.900 --> 02:45.900
Ah, you're gorgeous. Rhys is so lucky.

02:45.935 --> 02:48.900
I know. I've heard about his cock!

02:50.500 --> 02:52.900
What have you done to your arm?

03:04.700 --> 03:06.300
- You all right?
- Yeah.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.100
Owen should take a look at that.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.500
Um, nothing, it's just a scratch.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.100
Oh, Gwen.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.700
Gwen, you're pregnant.
Almost full term.

04:08.735 --> 04:11.900
Pregnant? That's not possible.

04:12.700 --> 04:13.465
How are you doing, Gwen?

04:13.500 --> 04:14.465
Jack, tell me what's going on?

04:14.500 --> 04:17.100
- Owen says I'm pregnant.
- You think?

04:17.500 --> 04:19.300
Jesus Christ. What with?

04:19.500 --> 04:20.899
It's an exo-biological insemination.

04:20.935 --> 04:22.265
That alien last night.

04:22.300 --> 04:25.500
Oh, get off. It bit me, Jack. That's all.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.665
It passed the eggs on in the bite.

04:30.700 --> 04:35.100
Some species do that. A sneaky way
of keeping the bloodline going.

04:35.135 --> 04:37.300
Boy, would Darwin have a field day,
if he'd made it to space.

04:37.335 --> 04:39.065
Mmm. Yeah. Great.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.265
Listen, Gwen, you are going
to be fine, I promise, okay?

04:41.300 --> 04:44.265
If there was any biological
incompatibility you would be dead.

04:44.300 --> 04:47.700
Now, according to this scan you're
carrying a non-sentient blastopheric mass.

04:47.735 --> 04:48.465
A what?

04:48.500 --> 04:51.900
It's a kind of alien egg. But I'm
going to look after you, I promise.

04:51.935 --> 04:54.300
We've got procedures in place
for this situation.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.465
You mean, this has happened before?

04:55.500 --> 04:59.300
You've heard of immaculate conception,
haven't you? Well...

04:59.335 --> 05:00.865
Right, we take you back to the Hub.

05:00.900 --> 05:05.300
You lie back, I run a bio-xenic microtron,
a couple of days, you'll be right as rain.

05:05.335 --> 05:06.665
Whoa, in a couple of days?

05:06.700 --> 05:08.900
In five hours I'm walking
down the aisle, Owen!

05:08.935 --> 05:10.065
No, you're not.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.100
Gwen, I hate to say this, but you're
going to have to postpone the wedding.

05:13.135 --> 05:16.665
No! No way. Have you any idea
how much a wedding costs?

05:16.700 --> 05:19.400
Listen, Gwen, you are not
carrying the baby Jesus in there-

05:19.435 --> 05:22.065
I don't care! All right?
I can't put Rhys through this.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.500
He's had to put up with enough, okay?
So I'm not postponing the wedding.

05:24.535 --> 05:25.865
You are not thinking straight!

05:25.900 --> 05:29.700
Do not bring my bloody hormones
into this, Mr. Jack Harkness!

05:30.500 --> 05:32.265
Okay, calm down.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.900
Owen has said if this wasn't safe
I would know about it by now. Right?

05:34.935 --> 05:35.865
As far as I know yeah...

05:35.900 --> 05:38.700
Okay, so I am good until
after the wedding.

05:38.735 --> 05:41.300
Then I'll do whatever I have to do.

05:41.335 --> 05:43.100
Once I'm Mrs. Williams.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.900
Not before.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.465
Hello?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.700
- Rhys?
- Gwen!

05:53.300 --> 05:54.865
Morning, lovely.

05:54.900 --> 06:00.900
Don't worry... Banana Boat's on the phone
to the florist, checking the buttonholes.

06:00.935 --> 06:01.665
Oh, he showed up, then?

06:01.700 --> 06:05.700
<i>Yeah, Lanzarote cops
let him go with a warning.</i>

06:05.735 --> 06:07.065
Rhys, I need to see you.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.700
It's bad luck before the wedding.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.700
What's happened?

06:13.700 --> 06:14.665
How is she?

06:14.700 --> 06:16.465
She's going ahead with the wedding.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.900
Which is fine, as long as she
doesn't go into labour at the altar.

06:19.935 --> 06:21.465
Rhys might forgive her
going down the aisle pregnant,

06:21.500 --> 06:24.900
but not giving birth to a razor-toothed
monster that eats half his family.

06:24.935 --> 06:25.465
Could that happen?

06:25.500 --> 06:28.300
Well, look, the pregnancy's advanced
and we're not familiar with the species.

06:28.335 --> 06:30.700
Which is why you, Owen, need to
open up the guy with the teeth

06:30.735 --> 06:32.300
and make sure there's no surprises.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.865
I'm on it.

06:33.900 --> 06:37.100
Tosh, you've got an early pass
to the wedding. Keep an eye on Gwen.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.865
- lanto-
- Jack?

06:38.900 --> 06:42.500
Gwen's going to need
a new wedding dress. Bigger.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.265
<i>Gwen? What is it?</i>

06:45.300 --> 06:46.865
You've got me going
out of my head.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.300
Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts.

06:48.335 --> 06:50.700
No, I'm not.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.465
Can I help you?

07:06.500 --> 07:09.300
Yeah, I'm looking for
a wedding dress for a friend.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.465
Of course you are, sir.

07:11.500 --> 07:15.500
You'd be surprised, we're quite used
to men buying for their "friends".

07:17.300 --> 07:18.700
- Bastard Torchwood!
- I know.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.500
- Bastard Torchwood!
- I know.

07:20.535 --> 07:22.065
Pregnant! You're pregnant!

07:22.100 --> 07:25.300
Sorry, out of everything that
could have screwed things up...

07:25.335 --> 07:26.665
I really don't know what to say.

07:26.700 --> 07:29.300
You don't have to say anything,
all right!

07:31.700 --> 07:33.265
Sorry.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.900
It's not your fault.

07:34.935 --> 07:36.500
It's them, it's Jack...

07:36.700 --> 07:38.900
It's not like he didn't know
you were getting married today!

07:38.935 --> 07:40.900
Why the hell did he have
to send you out last night?

07:40.935 --> 07:43.700
Because it's my job!

07:45.100 --> 07:46.700
Well, are you going to be all right?

07:46.735 --> 07:48.900
I'll be fine.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.265
They'll take me to the Hub.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.700
- Owen's got this big machine thing.
- Good.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.300
Yes.

07:58.700 --> 08:03.700
Right, erm, look, I'll...

08:04.500 --> 08:06.865
I'll get Banana to start
ringing people.

08:06.900 --> 08:09.300
We'll tell everybody you're ill.
Appendicitis or something-

08:09.335 --> 08:11.100
We're not postponing the wedding.

08:11.135 --> 08:11.865
No way.

08:11.900 --> 08:17.100
Forget the money, I want you where
they can look after you, right?

08:17.135 --> 08:18.500
Getting married today doesn't matter.

08:18.535 --> 08:20.900
It matters to me!

08:21.700 --> 08:24.900
It's not about the money, Rhys.

08:24.935 --> 08:28.100
I want to marry you. Today.

08:28.135 --> 08:30.265
Whatever happens.

08:30.300 --> 08:34.299
If the skies are suddenly
fill full of spaceships,

08:34.335 --> 08:35.865
or an army of weevils

08:35.900 --> 08:40.500
climb out of the drains
on St. Mary's Street, you fool!

08:41.100 --> 08:43.700
Do you not understand what
I'm saying, Rhys Williams?

08:43.735 --> 08:47.900
All I want to do today is marry you,

08:47.935 --> 08:51.500
that's all I want to do.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.700
Erm, Owen?

09:09.900 --> 09:11.465
- Look at you.
- Do you like it?

09:11.500 --> 09:15.200
Drop-dead gorgeous, Tosh, and I
think I speak with some authority.

09:15.235 --> 09:19.167
I don't really get a chance to
dress up much. What are you wearing?

09:19.202 --> 09:23.100
The truth is, Tosh, weddings
have never really been me, either.

09:23.135 --> 09:25.617
Love 'em and leave 'em.
That was me.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.976
Owen, you should come,
could be fun.

09:28.011 --> 09:30.265
Have you ever seen
a dead man dance?

09:30.300 --> 09:34.500
I've seen Fred Astaire
in Easter Parade. Twice.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.665
Late night TV.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.300
God, you need a date, don't you?

09:39.335 --> 09:42.500
Which this isn't, is it?

09:42.535 --> 09:44.465
No, Owen, it isn't.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.900
I just want you
to come to the wedding.

09:47.935 --> 09:50.300
Please.

09:50.500 --> 09:55.100
Oh, all right, I'll dig
out my dancing shoes.

09:58.900 --> 10:02.900
I know it's been
a while, duckling, but, er...

10:02.935 --> 10:06.465
we, er, never dreamed this.

10:06.500 --> 10:10.465
Rhys and I wanted it to
be a surprise for you.

10:10.500 --> 10:15.100
You're always full of them, but,
well, this beats them all.

10:15.135 --> 10:17.700
Is this why you haven't
come to see us?

10:17.735 --> 10:19.665
All those cancelled visits?

10:19.700 --> 10:22.300
No, no, Dad, don't be silly.
It's my job.

10:22.335 --> 10:25.265
This mysterious job.

10:25.300 --> 10:29.700
All the same, Swansea
isn't on another planet.

10:29.735 --> 10:31.900
You could have phoned, duckling.

10:31.935 --> 10:34.100
I'm sorry.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.665
Oh, don't be sorry, Gwen.

10:37.700 --> 10:41.100
I can't wait to see the look
on Rhys's mum's face.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.065
It's wonderful news, Gwen.

10:45.100 --> 10:49.300
Your dad's been holding his breath
waiting for a little grandchild.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.800
I was with Rhys and his mates
all night last night.

11:06.835 --> 11:09.900
No-one said anything
about Gwen being pregnant.

11:09.935 --> 11:12.517
Well, Rhys was probably
under orders.

11:12.552 --> 11:15.100
Gwen knows how to
control her man.

11:15.135 --> 11:17.900
Studied under the Mistress.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.100
Oh, here's Rhys's mum and dad.

11:21.135 --> 11:22.617
- Brenda.
- Geraint.

11:22.652 --> 11:24.065
- Barry.
- Hello.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.100
Lovely to see you, Brenda.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.665
What a lovely outfit.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.500
Such a brave choice for you.

11:31.535 --> 11:34.265
And you were so made for green.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.700
- Big day at last.
- How's the bride?

11:42.100 --> 11:47.900
Erm, maybe there's something
we should talk about...

11:50.100 --> 11:52.500
- Gwen!
- This isn't going to work, Rhys.

11:53.100 --> 11:56.300
We haven't thought it through.
What about after the wedding?

11:56.335 --> 11:57.065
I've been thinking the same.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.500
My mum and dad think that
they're getting a grandchild.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.465
Your mum and dad are going
to be thinking the same thing.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.700
They're going to be excited,
they're going to be planning things.

12:04.735 --> 12:08.900
I can't tell them I've lost a baby.
They'll be devastated.

12:09.300 --> 12:12.800
- We could tell them the truth.
- Talk sense now, Rhys.

12:12.835 --> 12:16.300
Well, the lies don't work, Gwen.
Remember? You tried it.

12:16.335 --> 12:18.700
What do you think the truth
will do to them?

12:18.735 --> 12:20.817
We've seen what
comes through the rift.

12:20.852 --> 12:22.976
I don't want my
mum and dad living in fear

12:23.011 --> 12:25.100
of what's prowling
around in the sewers!

12:26.100 --> 12:27.500
I'm sorry.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.665
Hey, Jack.

12:30.700 --> 12:31.865
Hey. How are you doing?

12:31.900 --> 12:35.465
Oh, you know, so far so good.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.100
Look, I just wanted to let you know
Tosh should be with you any time.

12:38.135 --> 12:39.300
<i>Call it moral support.</i>

12:39.500 --> 12:40.700
I don't need a baby-sitter.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.500
Give it here.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.865
We don't need you at all, Jack!

12:44.900 --> 12:47.065
<i>You've already done
plenty to mess up today.</i>

12:47.100 --> 12:49.700
Do us both a favour
and keep well out of it, yeah?

12:49.735 --> 12:51.265
Yeah, I hear you, Rhys.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.900
<i>Look, still, congratulations-</i>

13:00.500 --> 13:02.700
It's not his fault.

13:03.900 --> 13:07.265
Aw, this is nice, isn't it, Trina?

13:07.300 --> 13:10.200
Class on toast. Ey, you should
get a brochure, Mervyn.

13:10.235 --> 13:13.100
If some poor girl ever gets
drunk enough to marry you.

13:13.700 --> 13:16.065
Eh, yeah, that's funny.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.900
I tell you what, it's going
to take more than a swanky hotel

13:17.935 --> 13:19.465
to get a catch like me
down the aisle.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.000
And here's mad Mervyn,
the Minister of Sound!

13:22.035 --> 13:24.500
Well, the Duke of Disco,
the Regent of Rock

13:24.700 --> 13:26.900
- and the Lord of Love.
- Whatever you say, mate.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.100
Listen, do you want a hand
with the decks and the lights?

13:29.135 --> 13:31.065
Aye, but...

13:31.100 --> 13:36.100
I tell you what, reckon I'm up for
a bit of a Mervyn sandwich later.

13:39.300 --> 13:42.300
All right, love? You've got a big box.
Do you want a hand with that?

13:42.335 --> 13:43.465
No, thank you. I'm fine.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.500
Are you going to the wedding?

13:44.535 --> 13:45.665
I'm a friend of Gwen's.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.100
I'm Banana. I suppose
you can tell why.

13:48.135 --> 13:50.500
You come up in spots
and go soft quickly?

13:50.535 --> 13:52.265
I'm actually the best man.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.065
Evolution is full of surprises.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.665
I get to check everything
personally, right.

13:56.700 --> 14:00.100
- The disco, cake, flowers, seating.
- Bridal suite?

14:00.135 --> 14:01.865
Do you fancy a little drink later?

14:01.900 --> 14:05.700
Sorry, I'm intolerant
to vaso-active amines.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.100
Bananas make me vomit.

14:25.500 --> 14:31.065
Now, a looker like you
must be on the bride's side.

14:31.100 --> 14:34.700
I don't think they've got your
sort of style in Rhys's family.

14:34.735 --> 14:36.900
I like to put on a show.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.500
Jack sent me over with this.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.300
It's beautiful.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.700
And, I don't blame you for telling Jack
and Owen to stick a postponement.

15:06.735 --> 15:08.900
I think it's wonderful you're
getting married, whatever.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.100
Tosh, thank you.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.500
You're very lucky.

15:19.700 --> 15:23.900
You know, Tosh,
it'll happen for you, one day.

15:23.935 --> 15:25.900
There's always Owen...

15:25.935 --> 15:27.265
I don't think so.

15:27.300 --> 15:30.900
"In sickness and in health,
till death do us part".

15:30.935 --> 15:34.500
That's going to sound
like a bad joke, isn't it?

15:35.300 --> 15:37.500
Erm, I'll let you get on.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.300
If you need me, I'll be downstairs.

15:40.335 --> 15:42.900
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

15:49.300 --> 15:52.065
No, I like that one. Good choice.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.100
I estimated Gwen's size from
the Hub security laser scans.

15:55.135 --> 15:57.617
As you know,
my dad was a master tailor.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.776
He could size a man's
inside leg measurement

15:59.811 --> 16:01.900
by his stride across
the shop threshold.

16:01.935 --> 16:04.700
Ah, the family eye.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.400
Remind me to test it some time.

16:07.435 --> 16:09.465
- Well, if later on-
- Jack.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.300
- Yeah, brilliant, like that one.
- We've got a problem.

16:12.335 --> 16:13.900
Look what our friend was hiding.

16:13.935 --> 16:15.465
And that is?

16:15.500 --> 16:19.100
A proteus gland. The shape-shifting
organ of a Nostrovite.

16:19.135 --> 16:22.300
- And what is that, exactly?
- Trouble.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.065
Big trouble.

16:25.100 --> 16:28.665
No good-looking woman

16:28.700 --> 16:31.900
should be at a wedding
without a flower.

16:31.935 --> 16:33.700
Ouch!

16:34.500 --> 16:36.265
Bugger. Sorry.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.265
Can I get you another drink?

16:38.300 --> 16:42.700
Actually, do you feel
like getting a bite?

16:52.500 --> 16:54.900
Another spritzer, please.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.500
My God! It's true!

17:14.300 --> 17:15.500
But how-?

17:22.099 --> 17:23.800
Steady on, girl.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.500
I'm on stage later.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.900
Hey, baby, if you're looking for
my room, you just passed it, mind.

17:32.935 --> 17:35.465
I'm not. And don't call me baby.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.900
So what shall I call you, then?
Beautiful?

17:39.300 --> 17:42.500
Don't call me anything.
Don't say anything.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.700
Don't move!

18:03.100 --> 18:05.700
What have you done with him?

18:07.900 --> 18:09.900
What the hell is going on?

18:11.300 --> 18:14.100
You're lucky,
I'm watching my figure.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.700
But maybe I'll keep you for tea.

18:18.100 --> 18:22.100
A Nostrovite is a shape-shifting
carnivore with a taste for human flesh.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.417
It's intelligent and sneaky and,
damn it, I should have seen this before.

18:25.452 --> 18:28.700
That's it with shape-shifters in't?
You never know what you're looking at.

18:28.735 --> 18:30.300
What's the big deal? It's dead.

18:30.335 --> 18:32.065
Yeah. This one is.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.300
Does there have to be more?

18:33.335 --> 18:34.465
Nostrovites mate for life.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.065
You know, like swans and penguins.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.800
Yeah, except you don't find
Nostrovites on greetings cards.

18:38.835 --> 18:41.667
Right, and then the male Nostrovite
carries the fertilized eggs

18:41.702 --> 18:44.500
in a sac in its mouth and passes
it on to a host with a bite.

18:44.700 --> 18:45.465
Gwen.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.500
And where does
the mother come in?

18:46.700 --> 18:49.900
Well, she tracks down
the host, and rips it open.

18:49.935 --> 18:51.865
That's Nostrovite childbirth.

18:51.900 --> 18:55.500
And momma's out there right now,
looking for Gwen. Come on.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.265
Are you all right?

19:05.300 --> 19:08.700
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it was just a twinge.

19:08.735 --> 19:11.700
He'll be flexing his muscles.

19:11.735 --> 19:14.100
Not long to go now.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.065
- Tosh isn't responding.
- Then let's get going.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.665
Sure you're ready for this, Owen?
You know what a Nostrovite can do.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.500
You think you got it 100 feet away,
and it's already chewing on your liver.

19:34.535 --> 19:37.500
I don't need my liver.
You need me, Jack.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.100
The singularity scalpel?
Where are you going with that?

19:42.135 --> 19:44.065
We need to get to Gwen
before the Nostrovite,

19:44.100 --> 19:47.500
we might not get back to the Hub and
the microtron weighs about two tonnes.

19:47.700 --> 19:48.865
That thing kills people.

19:48.900 --> 19:51.665
- I saved Martha with it.
- Lucky shot.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.800
Listen you two, you'd better
start trusting me, okay?

19:53.835 --> 19:55.865
I've been working on it,
and I reckon I've got it sussed.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.100
Besides with that Nostrovite around,
we don't really have too many options.

19:59.135 --> 20:00.117
He's got a point.

20:00.152 --> 20:01.065
What is it with you?

20:01.100 --> 20:03.300
Ever since Owen died,
all you ever do is agree with him.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.065
I was brought up never
to speak ill of the dead.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.900
Even if they still do most
of the talking for themselves.

20:08.100 --> 20:11.700
Okay, Owen. But you better be
sure you know what you're doing.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.700
<i>Camouflage dressing?</i>

20:15.900 --> 20:17.665
I'm having her dressmaker's number.

20:17.700 --> 20:20.400
No way did Gwen look
pregnant last night.

20:20.435 --> 20:23.100
Oh, we must have had
way too much to drink.

20:23.135 --> 20:25.265
She was late, wasn't she?

20:25.300 --> 20:27.300
We must have been out of our
heads by the time she showed up.

20:27.335 --> 20:30.700
Oh, must have been,
not to notice she was pregnant.

20:30.735 --> 20:33.300
Great night, or what?

20:39.100 --> 20:42.100
You look like an angel.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.500
Mum, I'm so sorry about this.

20:47.535 --> 20:50.217
Gwen, it's a baby.

20:50.252 --> 20:52.900
It's God's blessing.

20:55.100 --> 20:59.465
You will be a good wife,
and a wonderful mother.

20:59.500 --> 21:04.900
And me and your dad, we'll always be
there for you, and for our grandchild.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.700
I'll see you downstairs.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.665
I love you.

21:11.700 --> 21:16.700
Mom... I love you too.

21:20.300 --> 21:24.900
Hurry up, Geraint. And make sure
you don't leave a wet patch!

21:44.300 --> 21:46.500
Gwen?

21:47.100 --> 21:49.500
What is it?

21:49.700 --> 21:52.300
I can't do this.

21:53.100 --> 21:56.100
I can't lie to you and mum, dad.

21:57.100 --> 22:00.100
Dad, this baby isn't Rhys's.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.300
There's still no sign of Banana Boat.

22:03.335 --> 22:04.465
He'll be fine, dad.

22:04.500 --> 22:08.500
Rhys, your mother says this
wedding is becoming a nightmare.

22:08.535 --> 22:12.100
As if Gwen showing up
pregnant wasn't bad enough.

22:12.135 --> 22:13.900
Now you are sure
it's yours, aren't you?

22:13.935 --> 22:15.465
Dad! I'm marrying her!

22:15.500 --> 22:18.100
I love Gwen, every atom
of me loves Gwen,

22:18.300 --> 22:21.500
has done since the first time
I laid eyes on her, okay?

22:21.700 --> 22:23.100
You loved Cerys Morgan once.

22:23.135 --> 22:26.017
I was 12 years old!

22:26.052 --> 22:28.900
Still no Banana Boat?

22:31.500 --> 22:33.465
Get away from me.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.900
Well, I wish I could, love.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.500
Don't bother, I've tried.
We're stuck fast.

22:40.535 --> 22:42.700
I can't believe it.

22:44.300 --> 22:48.700
Can you at least
move your hand? Away!

22:50.500 --> 22:51.300
If there's another man,

22:51.500 --> 22:54.300
if you don't want to go through
with the wedding, it's all right.

22:54.335 --> 22:55.317
We'll sort things out.

22:55.352 --> 22:56.265
There isn't another man.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.700
- But you said.
- Please listen.

23:01.100 --> 23:05.100
Cardiff is in the middle
of a space-time rift.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.265
A what?

23:06.300 --> 23:10.500
I work for an organisation that
controls what comes through it.

23:10.535 --> 23:11.865
Comes from where?

23:11.900 --> 23:15.500
Other planets. Other dimensions.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.100
Aliens, dad.

23:18.300 --> 23:22.900
I'm talking about aliens.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.700
That's what I do, Torchwood.
We're called Torchwood.

23:25.735 --> 23:30.300
We hunt down aliens that
come through the rift.

23:33.700 --> 23:34.265
Oh, my God.

23:34.300 --> 23:38.900
Look, one bit me last night,
don't ask me to explain, I can't.

23:38.935 --> 23:40.700
I'm pregnant.
Rhys isn't the father.

23:40.735 --> 23:43.500
It's an alien.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.300
An alien.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.800
Poor girl, this wedding's
got her stressed to pieces.

23:55.835 --> 23:59.100
Thinks that baby of hers
is an alien from outer space.

23:59.135 --> 24:00.717
- What?
- It'll be all right.

24:00.752 --> 24:02.265
Once we get through today.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.700
Gwen seems to be taking her time.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.817
You remember how it is, Brenda.

24:06.852 --> 24:08.900
A bride likes to make an entrance.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.900
Maybe, but I wasn't late
for my wedding.

24:11.935 --> 24:15.100
No. Barry might have got away.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.700
If it comes back,
it's going to kill us, isn't it?

24:20.735 --> 24:23.500
Calm down. I've got friends.

24:23.535 --> 24:24.465
They'll find us.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.865
But what if they don't?

24:25.900 --> 24:29.900
What if it comes back? I mean,
we're its bloody packed lunch, in't we?

24:29.935 --> 24:31.865
Help! Help!

24:31.900 --> 24:34.265
- Shut up!
- Help! Someone help!

24:34.300 --> 24:37.500
If it hears you screaming, it'll come
and shut you up... permanently!

24:37.535 --> 24:40.300
Help! Someone! Help.

24:41.500 --> 24:46.300
That's enough, unless you want
to start singing in falsetto.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.700
That really hurt.

25:46.900 --> 25:50.865
<i>Friends and family
of Rhys and Gwen,</i>

25:50.900 --> 25:55.700
<i>we're here today to celebrate
the marriage of two people,</i>

25:55.735 --> 25:58.900
<i>a ceremony binding in law...</i>

25:59.500 --> 26:01.465
- How much further?
- A few minutes.

26:01.500 --> 26:04.900
If people are going to make such
a big deal about getting married,

26:04.935 --> 26:07.100
why come all the way out
into the middle of nowhere,

26:07.135 --> 26:09.500
where no-one can find you, to do it?

26:09.900 --> 26:11.465
That, to me, suggests inner conflict.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.265
It's because the happy couple
want everything to be perfect.

26:14.300 --> 26:18.300
An alien egg in your belly and
its mother coming to rip you open.

26:18.335 --> 26:19.265
Yeah, perfect...

26:19.300 --> 26:24.300
<i>Rhys and Gwen
have chosen to solemnise</i>

26:24.335 --> 26:27.300
<i>their commitment before you...</i>

26:28.700 --> 26:33.900
<i>But first the law requires
me to ask of you all,</i>

26:34.100 --> 26:36.465
<i>if there is anyone here...</i>

26:36.500 --> 26:41.900
who knows of any reason
why these two may not marry?

26:41.935 --> 26:43.500
<i>Stop!</i>

26:45.900 --> 26:49.100
Stop it! Stop the wedding!

26:49.135 --> 26:51.300
- Hold on!
- Jack?

26:51.700 --> 26:54.300
Gwen, believe me, I'm sorry.

26:54.335 --> 26:56.865
But this has to stop now.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.400
I just knew
that baby wasn't Rhys's.

26:58.435 --> 26:59.900
What the hell
are you doing here?

27:00.100 --> 27:02.100
Jack, I told you,
I am marrying Rhys!

27:02.135 --> 27:04.865
Not now. You can't.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.300
Butt out! You've screwed things
up enough between me and Gwen.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.317
You are not going
to mess up our wedding!

27:09.352 --> 27:11.300
Listen, I am trying
to save Gwen's life.

27:11.335 --> 27:12.865
Yours, too.

27:12.900 --> 27:14.700
What's going on, Jack?

27:17.300 --> 27:19.900
I've got a fix on Tosh's comms.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.865
Tosh. Are you OK?

27:25.900 --> 27:27.900
Just get me out of here!

27:28.500 --> 27:30.465
All right, mate. I'm Banana.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.500
<i>- More like a gooseberry.
- Owen.</i>

27:33.700 --> 27:36.000
Oh, Jesus, that's disgusting.

27:36.035 --> 27:38.300
Let's get you out of there.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.200
There were two of them?

27:42.235 --> 27:43.665
Ma and Pa Nostrovite.

27:43.700 --> 27:49.100
They hunt in pairs. But childbirth
is more of a... three-way.

27:49.135 --> 27:51.265
He finds and impregnates a host.

27:51.300 --> 27:55.300
She then comes in like the midwife
from hell, hanging around,

27:55.335 --> 27:58.900
watching, waiting,
until the time is right.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.300
Then it gets messy.

28:00.335 --> 28:01.465
So you think it's near?

28:01.500 --> 28:03.065
She's a shape-shifter, Rhys.

28:03.100 --> 28:06.500
She could be out there making
small talk with your mom and dad.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.465
You reckon it's all over, then?

28:08.500 --> 28:10.700
Some good-looking guy
sweeps up the aisle

28:10.735 --> 28:12.900
and tells you to hold off
on the confetti.

28:12.935 --> 28:15.300
What are you going to do,
marry Rhys?

28:15.335 --> 28:16.665
So the baby's his, is it?

28:16.700 --> 28:19.900
Didn't you see the look on
her face when he showed up?

28:21.700 --> 28:25.500
I'd better go and find Mervyn.
Tell him not to bother

28:25.700 --> 28:28.300
getting George Michael
out the back of the van.

28:32.300 --> 28:33.800
We're not stopping the wedding.

28:33.835 --> 28:35.267
Gwen, there isn't a choice here.

28:35.302 --> 28:36.700
Ever since I've met you, Jack,

28:37.100 --> 28:40.100
all Rhys has had to put up with,
with me, is crap.

28:40.135 --> 28:43.100
The lies. The danger.
The complications.

28:43.135 --> 28:45.500
But he's stood by me.

28:45.700 --> 28:49.000
Who else would do that?

28:49.035 --> 28:52.265
Who else would marry me...

28:52.300 --> 28:56.100
knowing that I am carrying
some kind of monster inside me?

28:56.300 --> 29:02.100
I love him, and I'm going
to marry him, today.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.900
Thanks. But it is
my wedding, too.

29:09.700 --> 29:12.500
Don't I get a say?

29:19.100 --> 29:21.100
That's all we need.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.700
lanto, after the girl,
I need this contained.

29:26.735 --> 29:28.100
Jack!

29:28.300 --> 29:29.065
Oh, God!

29:29.100 --> 29:30.800
I want Gwen out of here now, Jack.

29:30.835 --> 29:32.500
Jack, I've seen the shape-shifter.

29:32.535 --> 29:35.100
It's a woman. She's in black.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.300
Do you know what's going on?

29:41.335 --> 29:43.065
I'm in the dark, too, Brenda.

29:43.100 --> 29:47.100
The problem seems to be an American
with no sense of timing or fashion.

29:47.135 --> 29:49.700
And your daughter!

29:50.900 --> 29:52.065
Call the police!

29:52.100 --> 29:54.300
Mervyn's been murdered!

29:54.900 --> 29:57.600
Jack, I'm afraid the situation
is uncontained.

29:57.635 --> 30:00.265
OK, lanto, get to the SUV,
jam the phone lines.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.800
<i>The last thing we need
is someone calling the police.</i>

30:02.835 --> 30:05.300
Tosh, you're with me,
we'll find that woman in black.

30:05.335 --> 30:07.900
Gwen, Owen needs to operate now.

30:07.935 --> 30:09.217
I want Gwen safe Jack, now.

30:09.252 --> 30:10.500
I want her safe, too, Rhys.

30:10.535 --> 30:12.865
So we do what I say!

30:12.900 --> 30:15.665
Rhys, Jack knows what
he's doing darling, okay?

30:15.700 --> 30:18.900
Look, if we run, the Nostrovite
will be waiting for us.

30:18.935 --> 30:20.100
And we're running out of time.

30:20.135 --> 30:21.500
What's the plan, Jack?

30:21.535 --> 30:23.665
I've got an idea.

30:23.700 --> 30:24.700
Then I'm staying here, okay?

30:24.735 --> 30:27.300
Fine! Tosh, with me.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.500
What the hell's going on here?

30:32.700 --> 30:34.900
I had a signal before.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.900
Move! I need everyone to stay calm
and do exactly as I tell you.

30:38.935 --> 30:40.500
- Who the hell are you?
- Torchwood.

30:40.535 --> 30:41.865
Gwen's Torchwood?

30:41.900 --> 30:43.265
You mean you're real?!

30:43.300 --> 30:46.500
- Jack! There she is!
- Everybody down!

31:00.900 --> 31:02.900
My God!

31:10.100 --> 31:11.500
Damn, that thing's fast!

31:11.535 --> 31:13.217
But it won't have gone far.

31:13.252 --> 31:14.900
Not without what it came for.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.700
Come on.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.700
That? The singularity scalpel?

31:22.735 --> 31:25.065
That is your idea?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.465
Gwen, it's cool, believe me.

31:26.500 --> 31:29.100
I've done a lot of work on it
since the whole Mayfly business.

31:29.135 --> 31:29.665
What is it?

31:29.700 --> 31:33.100
Alien medical apparatus...
so Owen thinks.

31:33.135 --> 31:34.500
Thinks?

31:35.500 --> 31:38.100
- Rhys? Are you in there, Rhys?
- That's his mother.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.900
That's Rhys's mother.

31:43.300 --> 31:43.865
Hiya.

31:43.900 --> 31:46.265
There's... there's a monster, Rhys.

31:46.300 --> 31:49.100
That American and the Japanese girl,
they went after it.

31:49.135 --> 31:50.900
Stay here.

31:55.300 --> 31:56.865
Jack, everything okay?

31:56.900 --> 31:59.600
It got away Owen. How's the patient?

31:59.635 --> 32:02.300
<i>Rhys and his mum are with her.</i>

32:03.500 --> 32:06.700
Jack! That's Rhys's mum, there!

32:06.735 --> 32:08.300
Come on.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.900
This isn't Rhys's baby, Brenda.

32:13.935 --> 32:15.900
It's an alien.

32:16.300 --> 32:17.665
Get back, you ugly bitch!

32:17.700 --> 32:18.700
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

32:18.735 --> 32:19.865
- That's my mother!
- No.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.300
- It's the alien.
- I'm not an alien!

32:21.335 --> 32:23.100
You're good, I'll give you that.

32:23.135 --> 32:24.265
But I'm not!

32:24.300 --> 32:26.500
Yeah, and the Lone Ranger
didn't have a thing with Tonto.

32:26.535 --> 32:29.100
Does the shape-shifter
copy smells too?

32:29.135 --> 32:30.065
No. It's just physical.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.100
Well, I'd recognise that
bloody awful perfume anywhere.

32:32.135 --> 32:34.700
It's Brenda, Jack. It's Brenda.

32:35.900 --> 32:39.300
That's for calling
my mother an ugly bitch!

32:39.335 --> 32:42.700
If that's Rhys's mum,
then who's that outside?

32:46.900 --> 32:50.900
Move! There she is!

32:57.300 --> 32:59.700
The bond between mother
and child is a wonderful thing.

32:59.735 --> 33:00.665
Let her go, okay?

33:00.700 --> 33:02.700
- Your mother for my child.
- No deal.

33:02.735 --> 33:03.817
You don't have a say.

33:03.852 --> 33:04.865
Don't listen to it, Gwen.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.265
It's okay, mum,
I'll make sure you're safe.

33:07.300 --> 33:09.300
- It won't kill you, you'll be okay.
- You can't do this.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.900
- It's my mum, Rhys. Jack...
- Gwen, I cant let-

33:10.935 --> 33:12.300
Rhys!

33:17.100 --> 33:19.100
- Okay, mum.
- Gwen...

33:19.135 --> 33:21.100
You're going to be okay.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.100
It's okay, mum.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.700
Stay calm, still.

33:30.735 --> 33:33.700
Come to momma!

33:40.700 --> 33:42.700
That's the kind of daughter
every mother must dream of.

33:42.735 --> 33:45.700
Cool as ice,
packing an automatic.

33:46.300 --> 33:49.265
Gwen told me about you
but I didn't believe her.

33:49.300 --> 33:54.300
It'll be back. Owen, get Gwen ready,
I want that thing dealt with now.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.300
Listen, Gwen, I'll be with you
in a minute. I need to talk to Rhys.

33:58.335 --> 34:00.700
- What about?
- Something and nothing. Trust me.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.465
What, what?

34:02.500 --> 34:05.865
Listen, Rhys,
the singularity scalpel.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.600
The last time I used it
I had two good mitts.

34:07.635 --> 34:09.264
So you're telling me
you can't operate it?

34:09.300 --> 34:11.100
Well, what I'm saying is,
I know you'd be more happy

34:11.300 --> 34:13.699
that whoever had Gwen's life
in their hands could...

34:13.735 --> 34:16.264
well, rely on both of them.

34:16.300 --> 34:18.300
Now I thought I could ask Jack-

34:18.335 --> 34:20.917
No, no, erm, show me what to do.

34:20.952 --> 34:23.500
Right, it kinda works itself.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.699
Hello, Jack.

34:30.300 --> 34:33.900
Not quite the blushing bride, am I?

34:34.900 --> 34:39.500
But I'd given up on things
going to plan a long time ago.

34:39.699 --> 34:41.699
If life always turned out
the way we expected,

34:41.900 --> 34:44.264
what would be the point of living?

34:44.300 --> 34:48.100
I didn't expect to meet
someone like you.

34:49.100 --> 34:51.465
Ifl hadn't, I'd be married by now.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.500
You're not the only one
who met somebody that

34:53.699 --> 34:56.699
knocked their world out of kilter.

35:00.300 --> 35:02.665
Rhys has always been there for me.

35:02.700 --> 35:06.300
Through all this madness, even
when I haven't even deserved it.

35:08.700 --> 35:12.100
He's not afraid
to tell me he loves me.

35:22.700 --> 35:23.700
Gwen

35:25.300 --> 35:27.300
Get her out of here!

35:57.100 --> 36:00.900
Come on, then! Do me a favour.

36:10.700 --> 36:11.665
Hey, are you all right?

36:11.700 --> 36:13.465
I'm running around in
a wedding dress

36:13.500 --> 36:16.300
with what feels like a keg of lager
stuck up my skirt.

36:16.335 --> 36:18.900
What do you think, Rhys?

36:18.935 --> 36:20.300
Come on!

36:26.100 --> 36:28.200
What happened?

36:28.235 --> 36:30.265
Put it down, Owen.

36:30.300 --> 36:31.900
It thought that I'd gone off.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.000
- Where's Gwen and Rhys?
- They've done a runner.

36:34.035 --> 36:35.865
Listen, I emptied a clip into
that thing as did Gwen.

36:35.900 --> 36:39.300
But some mother-instinct or something
is making that cow unstoppable.

36:39.335 --> 36:40.865
Our guns don't work.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.500
Then I guess we're
gonna need a bigger gun.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.500
Rhys, I can't go any further!

37:06.900 --> 37:09.065
- It's here! It's here!
- It'll hear!

37:09.100 --> 37:11.500
I don't think there's any
point in keeping quiet, Gwen.

37:15.700 --> 37:16.500
What the hell
are you doing with that?

37:16.535 --> 37:18.900
Owen showed me how to use it.

37:21.900 --> 37:25.100
Just do it! Do it!

37:32.100 --> 37:35.100
- Rhys!
- All right, all right.

37:35.700 --> 37:36.865
I've got it now.

37:36.900 --> 37:41.100
I love you... I really love you.

37:50.100 --> 37:53.300
Gwen! Gwen?

37:54.900 --> 37:56.700
Gwen?!

38:05.300 --> 38:08.300
Get away from her, Rhys!

38:08.900 --> 38:12.700
Let me have my young
and I won't hurt you.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.300
You're too late! It's gone!

38:16.700 --> 38:18.800
And I've had a gutful of you!

38:18.835 --> 38:20.865
You get my girlfriend pregnant,

38:20.900 --> 38:24.900
you impersonate my mum
and you ruin my wedding day!

38:27.700 --> 38:29.065
Fuck!

38:29.100 --> 38:32.265
Rhys, you're a bad boy.

38:32.300 --> 38:35.500
And you know what bad boys get?

38:40.700 --> 38:43.100
How's that for a shape-shift?

38:44.300 --> 38:46.100
Jack...

38:47.300 --> 38:50.900
Hey, that whole Evil Dead thing
looks pretty good on you, Rhys.

38:53.700 --> 38:55.300
- You okay?
- Yeah.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.500
And...

39:02.900 --> 39:06.500
the hero always gets the girl.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.065
I am sorry.

39:13.100 --> 39:16.000
I've spoilt everything, haven't I?

39:16.035 --> 39:18.900
Do you still want to marry me?

39:20.900 --> 39:28.900
I call upon these persons
here present to witness that I,

39:29.700 --> 39:34.300
Gwen Elizabeth Cooper...

39:34.700 --> 39:41.700
<i>Do take thee, Rhys Alun Williams,
to be my lawful wedded husband.</i>

39:41.735 --> 39:47.300
Do take thee, Rhys Alun Williams,

39:48.300 --> 39:51.300
to be my lawful wedded husband.

39:55.900 --> 39:57.500
Come here.

40:26.100 --> 40:29.100
You ready to see that
dead man dance, Tosh?

40:29.135 --> 40:30.500
Come on.

40:50.700 --> 40:52.465
Mind if I cut in?

40:52.500 --> 40:55.500
Why not? I'm danced off my feet.

40:55.535 --> 40:57.300
I'm gonna find a beer.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.300
Enjoy the honeymoon.

41:11.335 --> 41:13.300
I will.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.700
What will you do while I'm gone?

41:17.735 --> 41:20.517
Ooh, the usual.

41:20.552 --> 41:23.300
Pizza, lanto...

41:23.900 --> 41:26.700
Save the world a couple of times.

41:27.100 --> 41:27.900
Will you miss me?

41:28.100 --> 41:29.900
Always.

41:31.500 --> 41:36.100
Rhys is a lucky man,
a perfect husband.

41:36.900 --> 41:41.100
He's loyal... brave...

41:42.900 --> 41:45.500
he's got a hell
of a swing on him!

41:50.300 --> 41:53.700
And best of all,
he really loves you.

41:54.300 --> 41:56.500
I know.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.500
May I... erm...?

42:07.100 --> 42:09.100
Yes.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.600
There you go.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.500
Cheers, mate.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.500
You'd never think
a couple of hours ago

42:39.700 --> 42:43.500
they all nearly got torn apart
by some alien psycho-bitch.

42:43.900 --> 42:47.300
It's all been a bit too much
for my mum and Brenda.

42:47.335 --> 42:49.500
I never thought I'd see that.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.665
Okay, Jack, what's going on?

42:58.700 --> 43:02.700
Strange thing when you mix
Level Six retcon with champagne.

43:02.735 --> 43:06.700
Really makes the party go
with a swing. Then you fall asleep.

43:06.735 --> 43:10.100
You retconned our families?

43:10.700 --> 43:12.665
It's probably for the best.

43:12.700 --> 43:16.300
I don't want my mum remembering
what happened to her today.

43:19.500 --> 43:22.465
Maybe the happy couple
shouldn't either?

43:22.500 --> 43:27.300
No, thank you. There'll be
no secrets in this marriage.

43:29.100 --> 43:31.265
Time for bed, I think.

43:31.300 --> 43:33.100
We'll see you
after the honeymoon.

43:33.135 --> 43:35.100
Stay out of trouble.

43:39.100 --> 43:41.500
Thank you for the dress.
It was beautiful.

43:48.100 --> 43:51.300
Something tells me our
bed time is a long way off.

43:51.335 --> 43:52.900
That's right, guys,
it's been a busy day,

43:52.935 --> 43:54.665
but we are not finished yet.

43:54.700 --> 43:58.700
We've got a lot to do.
We've got a major mop-up operation.

43:59.100 --> 44:01.600
And I want your best work.

44:01.635 --> 44:04.100
Remember, it's Gwen's wedding.

44:04.900 --> 44:07.665
That's what I love about Torchwood.

44:07.700 --> 44:11.100
By day you're chasing
the scum of the universe.

44:11.135 --> 44:14.300
Come midnight,
you're the Wedding Fairy.

45:14.100 --> 45:15.500
It's more than just a cinema.

45:15.535 --> 45:17.300
<i>It's the Electro.</i>

45:17.500 --> 45:21.100
<i>A once-in-a-lifetime show.</i>

45:21.135 --> 45:23.217
Why not step inside?

45:23.252 --> 45:25.265
I just saw Jack.

45:25.300 --> 45:26.665
He's part of this freak show?

45:26.700 --> 45:28.465
The night travellers,
they did exist.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.465
<i>They only performed
at the dead of night.</i>

45:30.500 --> 45:34.700
So two people from a piece of
film have decided to go AWOL?

45:36.100 --> 45:36.865
What's wrong?

45:36.900 --> 45:38.300
<i>Her mouth has been
drained of moisture.</i>

45:38.335 --> 45:40.100
What the hell are they up to?

45:40.500 --> 45:42.900
Time to bring the others.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.400
This way, please.

45:45.305 --> 45:51.360
