<i>Previously on "Good Witch"...</i>

00:02.485 --> 00:05.335
Then I wish I had more to
offer you than an internship,

00:05.345 --> 00:08.240
- but what do you say?
- I'm really sorry for what I did.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.833
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.304
I can't believe Sam is still on the market.

00:12.314 --> 00:14.591
He's such a catch.

00:25.578 --> 00:28.313
There's nothing I like better than
red wine and dessert after 11:00.

00:28.553 --> 00:29.651
Nothing?

00:29.683 --> 00:30.684
Well, top five.

00:32.023 --> 00:34.788
- Didn't expect to see you tonight.
- Well, you called.

00:34.821 --> 00:35.991
Well, I'm a smart man.

00:36.024 --> 00:37.582
Hmm. I won't argue that.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.520
- How's Nick handling everything?
- He's pretty happy.

00:41.530 --> 00:44.115
Uh, Linda made the whole
situation easier for him.

00:44.125 --> 00:47.618
Surprised me. She actually did
the right thing for a change.

00:47.628 --> 00:50.194
"Well done is better than well said."

00:50.399 --> 00:52.134
- Ben Franklin.
- Hmm.

00:52.144 --> 00:54.437
A very wise man who knew that what we do

00:54.469 --> 00:56.604
is often more important than what we say.

00:56.637 --> 00:59.370
- Our actions never lie.
- No, they don't.

01:00.662 --> 01:03.478
And Grace is really looking
forward to interning at your office.

01:03.512 --> 01:05.262
Ah, she's gonna do great.

01:05.901 --> 01:08.459
- Both our kids are happy.
- They are.

01:09.374 --> 01:11.914
Hey, you didn't say. How
did the archeology thing go?

01:11.924 --> 01:14.883
Oh, uh... Very academic.

01:16.586 --> 01:19.736
It was nice of you to fill
in for John's girlfriend.

01:20.737 --> 01:21.756
What?

01:21.766 --> 01:25.657
John just told me that
Anna broke up with him.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.743
Well, that's too bad, but I think

01:27.753 --> 01:29.804
he's the kind of guy
that bounces back quickly.

01:29.814 --> 01:33.382
Yeah. He wants to be attached,
but he doesn't want attachments.

01:33.392 --> 01:36.401
- Meaning?
- He was a bit of a player in college.

01:36.411 --> 01:38.692
Can't imagine anybody playing you.

01:38.780 --> 01:41.723
Which is why we were just friends.

01:43.028 --> 01:45.120
- I think we should celebrate.
- Yeah? Celebrate what?

01:45.153 --> 01:46.971
Um, our kids being happy?

01:46.981 --> 01:48.591
Our friendship,

01:48.623 --> 01:50.458
surviving Linda? I don't
care, take your pick.

01:50.492 --> 01:52.128
- We could all go to dinner.
- We could.

01:52.161 --> 01:53.947
You, Grace, Nick and me.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.597
Yeah. Or...

01:55.631 --> 01:57.211
Just you and I could go out.

01:57.432 --> 01:59.567
Huh. An inspired idea.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.698
Well, we're inspirational people.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.267
Where should we go?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.049
How about I surprise you?

02:06.059 --> 02:09.144
I know it won't be an easy
feat, but I do love a challenge.

02:09.176 --> 02:10.926
Oh, I'm a challenge, huh?

02:11.681 --> 02:13.566
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:47.651 --> 02:49.259
- Hey, Alexis.
- Cassie!

02:49.269 --> 02:52.221
- Welcome to Grey House.
- Oh, it's so cozy.

02:52.231 --> 02:55.724
- Thank you. This is George.
- Oh, hi, George.

02:55.756 --> 02:57.659
So I don't usually
do the B-and-B thing,

02:57.692 --> 03:00.563
I prefer hotels, but this is nice.

03:00.595 --> 03:03.222
Well, everyone has a
different comfort level.

03:03.232 --> 03:05.534
- True.
- What brings you to town?

03:05.566 --> 03:07.702
Oh, I am visiting my brother.

03:07.736 --> 03:10.149
We're really close, and he
teaches at the local high school.

03:10.159 --> 03:12.675
- Oh, my daughter Grace goes there.
- Oh, that's so nice.

03:12.708 --> 03:15.703
Yeah, he's the only teacher in my
family. Everyone else is in finance.

03:15.713 --> 03:17.936
They work for my father.
He's big in banking.

03:17.946 --> 03:19.271
- And you?
- Ugh, no.

03:19.281 --> 03:21.575
I can't even balance a checkbook.

03:21.850 --> 03:24.746
- Oh, wow. These are stunning.
- Thank you.

03:25.155 --> 03:27.149
Alexis, this is my cousin Abigail.

03:27.159 --> 03:29.798
Abigail is Middleton's resident florist.

03:29.808 --> 03:31.128
Oh, perfect!

03:31.138 --> 03:33.718
I would love an arrangement
like this for my room.

03:33.728 --> 03:35.954
- I can do that.
- How soon?

03:37.031 --> 03:39.051
I just want to be able to enjoy them.

03:39.061 --> 03:41.017
If it's a rush, I can pay extra.

03:41.027 --> 03:42.402
Cash or credit?

03:42.412 --> 03:45.474
Oh, I actually lost my father's credit card

03:45.484 --> 03:47.319
on the way here and I don't have any cash.

03:47.329 --> 03:50.279
- Can I just charge it to the room?
- Of course.

03:50.311 --> 03:52.380
Good. My father's paying
for everything anyway.

03:52.414 --> 03:54.382
So I'll just swing by the bank,

03:54.416 --> 03:56.741
and I'll settle up with
cash when I check out.

03:56.751 --> 03:58.583
Sounds like you have a plan.

03:59.266 --> 04:01.960
I think I'm gonna take a
little walk around the property.

04:01.970 --> 04:04.069
I left my bags on the porch.

04:04.079 --> 04:06.499
Do you think you could just be
a doll and take them upstairs?

04:06.509 --> 04:07.724
I'll take care of it.

04:07.734 --> 04:09.864
Oh, and be really careful
with the small bag.

04:09.898 --> 04:11.798
There's breakables in there.

04:16.704 --> 04:18.603
Talk about high-maintenance.

04:19.646 --> 04:21.696
I think I'll charge her double.

04:21.809 --> 04:23.745
What? You heard her.

04:23.779 --> 04:26.256
Daddy's picking up the bill anyway, right?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.816
That's what she said.

04:37.985 --> 04:39.132
All right.

04:40.967 --> 04:44.025
You need a ride home? I know your
mom's been picking you up from school.

04:44.035 --> 04:45.563
Uh, I'll walk.

04:45.573 --> 04:46.835
Then what?

04:46.867 --> 04:49.971
Uh, I don't know. Probably
hang out with some friends.

04:50.004 --> 04:53.604
Did you give any thought to
what we talked about last night?

04:53.641 --> 04:55.310
Come on. Now that you
quit the basketball team,

04:55.343 --> 04:58.543
you need to find something
else to do with your time.

04:58.747 --> 05:01.330
You need something besides
school to put your energy into.

05:01.340 --> 05:02.885
I'll find something.

05:02.917 --> 05:04.720
Yeah, you said that last night.

05:04.752 --> 05:06.988
- I'd like to see you do it today.
- What do you mean?

05:07.021 --> 05:09.524
Just find something, anything,
that you're passionate about.

05:09.557 --> 05:13.206
Sports, drama, a club of any kind...

05:13.216 --> 05:14.616
Whatever you want.

05:14.896 --> 05:16.765
All right, all right.

05:16.997 --> 05:18.497
I'll find something.

05:21.569 --> 05:22.661
Bye.

05:27.146 --> 05:28.311
What's up?

05:29.191 --> 05:30.311
Bye.

05:39.153 --> 05:41.370
The arrangement for Alexis is beautiful.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.693
- I'm slammed with orders.
- Oh, Alexis will understand.

05:44.725 --> 05:47.862
She's called twice already
about her arrangement.

05:47.896 --> 05:49.937
- Alexis?
- A new guest.

05:50.447 --> 05:53.491
Well, I wish your new guest
was a cute, single guy.

05:53.501 --> 05:55.512
I could use the distraction.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.572
I still can't believe he
didn't accept my apology.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.408
Ben?

06:00.441 --> 06:02.761
Maybe we're not meant to be.
I mean, if he broke up with me

06:02.771 --> 06:05.032
just because I didn't
introduce him to my mother,

06:05.042 --> 06:08.042
is he really interested
in having a relationship?

06:08.284 --> 06:10.119
Why are we still talking about this?

06:10.151 --> 06:12.687
Uh, because you roped Cassie
into coming and picking up

06:12.720 --> 06:15.391
her own flower order to save you time,

06:15.424 --> 06:18.953
and I still need to talk about what
happened with Ben because I'm upset.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.013
Don't you have any girlfriends?

06:21.337 --> 06:24.066
No.

06:24.098 --> 06:27.349
I have told Ben over and
over how much he means to me.

06:27.359 --> 06:30.809
Maybe it's time to show Ben
how you really feel about him.

06:31.006 --> 06:35.517
That's just the thing. After all
of this, I'm not sure what to do.

06:37.329 --> 06:40.448
As much as I would love to
continue to listen to your saga,

06:40.482 --> 06:42.243
some of us have jobs.

06:54.319 --> 06:55.797
Did I tell you?

06:55.807 --> 06:58.556
I really like what my friend
Denise did with her house.

06:58.566 --> 06:59.649
Oh, yeah?

07:00.535 --> 07:02.552
And speaking of decorating,

07:03.605 --> 07:05.107
what do you think?

07:05.139 --> 07:08.737
I think it's a changing table for a baby?

07:08.974 --> 07:10.194
Yeah.

07:10.744 --> 07:12.294
We don't have a baby.

07:12.681 --> 07:13.848
Yet.

07:15.022 --> 07:17.443
What about this one? It's really heavy,

07:17.453 --> 07:19.937
but that just means that it's
sturdy. And really, how often are you

07:19.947 --> 07:23.097
going to move a changing
table around a baby's room?

07:23.962 --> 07:28.730
Honey, I think it's awesome that
you're so excited about this, but...

07:28.763 --> 07:31.204
Maybe you need to slow down a little?

07:31.559 --> 07:33.115
You clearly have no idea

07:33.125 --> 07:35.425
how much there is to do once I'm pregnant.

07:35.435 --> 07:37.345
If we wait until then to do everything,

07:37.355 --> 07:39.495
we'll never have the
baby's room done in time.

07:39.505 --> 07:40.898
The baby's room is our room.

07:41.956 --> 07:43.578
We don't need an office.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.833
It's not "our office," It's my den.

07:45.843 --> 07:48.419
- Why do you need a den?
- It's a guy thing.

07:48.429 --> 07:51.242
Well, there are sacrifices that
we're both gonna have to make.

07:51.252 --> 07:54.523
Oh, really? What are you giving up?

07:54.556 --> 07:57.560
Uh, my figure for nine months.

07:59.063 --> 08:01.963
In fairness, I think
we're both giving that up.

08:02.304 --> 08:04.726
I'll stop talking now.

08:04.736 --> 08:07.001
You said you wanted to move
forward with starting a family,

08:07.035 --> 08:09.251
but you're not helping us get ready.

08:09.261 --> 08:12.211
Brandon, I'm gonna need
something from you, too.

08:23.794 --> 08:27.363
Well, you can tell Dad to stop worrying.

08:27.373 --> 08:28.857
You got a job?

08:28.889 --> 08:30.459
No, better.

08:31.524 --> 08:33.517
I'm going to start my own business.

08:33.527 --> 08:35.292
I'm sorry, your own what?

08:35.302 --> 08:37.551
I'm going to be my own boss.

08:37.769 --> 08:40.164
You know, I feel that perhaps

08:40.174 --> 08:42.294
we've gotten just a tad off-track here.

08:42.304 --> 08:45.665
Please, please, tell me that
you are gainfully employed.

08:45.902 --> 08:47.604
I'm going to start a car service.

08:47.614 --> 08:50.011
Limos, town cars...

08:50.021 --> 08:51.579
You know, like that.

08:52.306 --> 08:53.562
Oh!

08:53.781 --> 08:54.955
Uh...

08:55.410 --> 08:57.450
Do you have a business plan?

08:57.714 --> 08:58.934
No.

08:59.489 --> 09:01.328
Do you have a commercial driver's license?

09:02.562 --> 09:04.526
Uh... No.

09:06.172 --> 09:09.996
Well, you'll be the first
ever car service in Middleton.

09:10.030 --> 09:12.689
You'll certainly corner the market.

09:12.699 --> 09:15.988
- No. I'm going to do it in Blairsville.
- Blairsville?

09:18.850 --> 09:21.007
It's a much more cosmopolitan city.

09:22.455 --> 09:25.386
- Look, all I need is investors.
- Investors.

09:25.396 --> 09:27.397
Yeah, money to get the
business started and then...

09:27.407 --> 09:28.935
money probably for the first year,

09:28.945 --> 09:31.046
until I can get the
business up on its feet.

09:31.056 --> 09:34.122
- Mmm.
- I think $50,000 should be enough.

09:36.282 --> 09:38.133
Fifty thousand dollars.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.726
Yeah, you gotta spend money to make money.

09:53.352 --> 09:54.549
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:54.582 --> 09:56.632
I was hoping you could help me.

09:57.052 --> 09:58.520
Passiflora incarnata.

09:58.553 --> 10:00.203
It's good for insomnia.

10:00.311 --> 10:02.369
Hmm. I've been dragging.

10:02.487 --> 10:04.070
Since this whole thing with Ben,

10:04.080 --> 10:06.630
I just haven't had a good night's sleep.

10:07.154 --> 10:10.804
Well, sometimes a little passion
flower is just what you need.

10:12.299 --> 10:13.434
Excuse me.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.904
- Hello.
- Um...

10:18.273 --> 10:20.998
- Do you have any vitamin C?
- Sinus congestion?

10:21.472 --> 10:22.646
Yeah.

10:23.544 --> 10:26.414
Mullein extract and my peach tea.

10:28.646 --> 10:30.876
- Peach tea?
- Well, the mullein can be a bit bitter,

10:30.886 --> 10:33.388
so I add a little flavorful tea extract.

10:33.398 --> 10:35.038
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:35.048 --> 10:37.669
So how are you with
restaurant recommendations?

10:38.260 --> 10:40.600
The bistro is a town favorite.

10:41.295 --> 10:43.966
- I'm Andrew, by the way.
- I'm Cassie. This is Stephanie.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.170
Hi.

10:46.411 --> 10:48.651
So, which way to the bistro?

10:48.661 --> 10:50.364
Oh, well, Stephanie was
just on her way there.

10:50.374 --> 10:52.507
- Yeah.
- I'm not from here.

10:52.517 --> 10:54.117
I'm visiting a client.

10:54.648 --> 10:56.086
I'm an attorney.

10:56.096 --> 10:58.017
Well, follow me.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.707
Thanks. How much do I owe you?

11:00.717 --> 11:04.517
Oh, it's on the house. Try it.
If you like it, you can come back.

11:04.653 --> 11:06.264
Great. Perfect.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.663
- So, what kind of law are you into?
- Estate law.

11:09.673 --> 11:12.611
I'll be here for a few days. I'm
deposing a witness in Middleton.

11:12.621 --> 11:13.796
Oh.

11:31.377 --> 11:34.172
Welcome! You didn't drive, did you?

11:34.182 --> 11:36.118
You know I'm taking my test tomorrow.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.274
I know.

11:37.284 --> 11:39.372
Uh, you don't have to take me, by the way.

11:39.382 --> 11:41.482
- Brandon volunteered.
- But...

11:41.493 --> 11:43.843
Brandon makes you nervous in the car.

11:44.515 --> 11:46.197
No, I'm taking you.

11:46.207 --> 11:49.156
We started this together,
we'll finish it together.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.098
We'll get you started
as soon as Eve gets back.

11:51.108 --> 11:53.000
Okay. Oh!

11:53.033 --> 11:55.795
Our English class is going to that
next week. "A Midsummer Night's Dream."

11:55.805 --> 11:58.505
Mmm-hmm. I was thinking
of taking your mom.

11:58.782 --> 12:01.732
- She loves Shakespeare.
- You mean like a date?

12:01.850 --> 12:03.401
Uh... No.

12:03.774 --> 12:07.482
- What is it, then?
- Two friends going to a play.

12:07.492 --> 12:09.942
Well, whatever it is, it's a nice idea.

12:11.952 --> 12:14.162
So I hear you're going to
be our new intern, Grace.

12:14.172 --> 12:16.776
Yes, I am. I can't wait.

12:16.786 --> 12:18.823
Can you train her? Show
her around the office?

12:18.833 --> 12:22.265
- You bet.
- Thanks again. And thank you, Eve.

12:22.957 --> 12:24.700
She's all yours.

12:24.733 --> 12:27.268
Dr. Radford's office.

12:28.268 --> 12:29.560
Yes.

12:29.570 --> 12:31.554
Can you hold? Thank you.

12:32.865 --> 12:35.068
Now, to transfer a call,
you need to enter the number,

12:35.078 --> 12:37.928
put it on hold, then
conference, then hang up.

12:38.828 --> 12:41.234
No, wait. You need to put it on hold first,

12:41.244 --> 12:43.610
then enter the number, then hang up.

12:44.648 --> 12:46.295
Did I say conference?

12:46.305 --> 12:47.922
- No.
- Okay, you need to do that

12:47.956 --> 12:49.691
- before you put the number in.
- Okay!

12:49.724 --> 12:51.530
Do you need me to repeat that?

12:51.540 --> 12:53.524
Um, actually, I think I got it.

12:53.534 --> 12:56.388
To transfer, put the call
on hold, open a new line,

12:56.398 --> 12:58.897
dial the number or extension
to connect the two lines,

12:58.907 --> 13:01.155
hit conference and then, hang up?

13:01.902 --> 13:04.035
- Impressive!
- Thanks.

13:04.045 --> 13:06.361
I've always been able to pick
up on things pretty quickly.

13:06.371 --> 13:08.502
But I also have a really great teacher.

13:09.376 --> 13:10.924
This is gonna be great.

13:23.515 --> 13:25.793
So, can I get you anything else?

13:26.540 --> 13:28.152
I'm stuffed.

13:28.370 --> 13:31.622
Are you sure? I have homemade
double chocolate mousse pie.

13:31.656 --> 13:34.656
- Whipped cream?
- Ooh, I like the way you think.

13:35.124 --> 13:36.754
I like this restaurant.

13:37.561 --> 13:39.311
Um, I called my order in?

13:41.800 --> 13:44.368
- Hey, there!
- Oh, hey! That's a nice surprise.

13:44.401 --> 13:45.855
Actually, I was gonna
come by your shop later.

13:45.865 --> 13:46.883
For what?

13:46.893 --> 13:49.405
Did you hear about the new zip-line
opening up at Alder Falls tomorrow?

13:49.415 --> 13:50.539
I did.

13:50.549 --> 13:53.045
I can't pass it up. I
thought we could go together.

13:53.078 --> 13:55.018
Oh, yeah, my zip-lining days are over.

13:55.028 --> 13:56.882
I don't believe that for a second.

13:56.915 --> 13:58.617
Come on, I know you want to go.

13:58.650 --> 14:01.997
Well, even if I did, I don't
have anyone to watch the shop.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.622
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:03.655 --> 14:05.805
John, this is my cousin, Abigail.

14:06.228 --> 14:08.894
- Charmed.
- The flower shop.

14:09.095 --> 14:12.318
- Yes.
- I sent Cassie that arrangement.

14:12.866 --> 14:14.532
The professor.

14:15.395 --> 14:18.098
You didn't sound this tall on the phone.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.955
- People often say I have a short voice.
- Oh.

14:20.965 --> 14:23.177
Ok, bye, you two. Good luck.

14:26.578 --> 14:29.328
Now, what would you
possibly need luck with?

14:29.881 --> 14:32.881
Let me buy you a cup of
coffee and I'll tell you.

14:45.272 --> 14:46.328
Oh.

14:46.665 --> 14:48.020
What's this?

14:48.030 --> 14:51.058
Salmon. It's good for you. And for me.

14:51.896 --> 14:54.696
It's good for women who
want to get pregnant.

14:55.784 --> 14:58.042
- Uh...
- Three bean salad.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.684
I hate beans.

14:59.694 --> 15:02.444
It's rich in iron,
folate, calcium and zinc.

15:04.698 --> 15:07.283
Turnip greens. I need the extra folic acid

15:07.293 --> 15:10.251
to protect against
neural tube birth defects.

15:10.261 --> 15:13.963
Right, yeah, but why do I
have to eat all this stuff?

15:14.209 --> 15:17.609
We're a team. We're either
in this together or we're not.

15:28.207 --> 15:29.497
Mmm.

15:29.761 --> 15:31.466
Oh!

15:31.476 --> 15:34.072
You're gonna love the kale tartlets.

15:34.965 --> 15:36.822
Kale tartlets?

15:41.136 --> 15:43.294
Think of it as investing in our future.

15:43.549 --> 15:46.264
- It's $50,000.
- You cannot put a price on love.

15:46.274 --> 15:47.698
Your son just did.

15:47.708 --> 15:50.208
Well, my love has no limits.

15:50.218 --> 15:52.648
Yes, but our bank account does.

15:52.658 --> 15:54.914
- He'll be crushed!
- He'll get over it.

15:54.924 --> 15:58.147
- This is his dream.
- To start a limo service?

15:58.157 --> 16:00.779
- He doesn't even own a car.
- You're being too literal.

16:00.812 --> 16:04.044
And as usual, you are
being too easy on him.

16:04.249 --> 16:07.485
Are you asking me to
turn my back on my son?

16:07.517 --> 16:10.086
I'm asking you to really help him

16:10.096 --> 16:11.946
by finally not helping him.

16:13.323 --> 16:15.557
- Do nothing?
- It's what he needs.

16:23.264 --> 16:24.402
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:24.412 --> 16:26.361
Is it possible to change rooms?

16:26.371 --> 16:28.120
- Is there a problem?
- Ugh, well,

16:28.130 --> 16:30.507
the mattress is really
hard and the bed is cramped.

16:30.540 --> 16:32.510
Do you have any rooms
with a king-sized bed?

16:32.543 --> 16:35.313
Well, the room across the hall has a
king and it's got a little more space.

16:35.346 --> 16:38.209
Great. I'll take it. Oh, thanks, George.

16:38.219 --> 16:40.328
There's something in
there that I'm allergic to.

16:40.952 --> 16:43.002
Oh, can you help me move rooms?

16:44.131 --> 16:46.207
Uh, with great pleasure.

16:46.217 --> 16:47.875
Thank you. You're so nice.

16:47.885 --> 16:51.285
- Oh, hey. Is your kitchen still open?
- What do you need?

16:51.295 --> 16:52.593
- Can I have some cheese?
- Sure.

16:52.603 --> 16:55.432
And a few crackers? Oh,
and do you have any fruits?

16:55.466 --> 16:57.756
- Yes.
- Great. And some wine?

16:57.868 --> 16:59.468
I have a bottle of red open.

16:59.478 --> 17:03.109
Oh, no. Oh, I can only
drink white. I get migraines.

17:03.119 --> 17:05.531
- Well, I will get you set up.
- Awesome.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.261
Okay. Is there a rule
about eating in the rooms?

17:08.271 --> 17:09.964
- No.
- Okay.

17:09.974 --> 17:11.683
So when she's finished
with the cheese plate,

17:11.715 --> 17:13.773
do you think you could just bring it on up?

17:13.784 --> 17:15.727
Great. Thank you! Bye.

17:17.753 --> 17:19.446
One more question,

17:19.924 --> 17:21.732
when can I check out?

17:29.834 --> 17:32.107
So Steve's having a big party this weekend.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.427
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:33.437 --> 17:34.957
When do you get your driver's license?

17:34.967 --> 17:36.808
- Hopefully tomorrow.
- Oh.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.575
But I've never driven at night.

17:38.608 --> 17:40.422
Well, his parties are legendary.

17:40.432 --> 17:44.049
Everyone's going, and even
if you can't drive, come.

17:44.234 --> 17:46.100
I'll think about it.

17:46.110 --> 17:48.942
So you're really interning
at my dad's office?

17:48.952 --> 17:50.333
Yeah, it's fun.

17:50.343 --> 17:52.191
Grace, it's me.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.658
Nick, I'm serious.

17:54.692 --> 17:57.495
I thought it was just
some extra credit thing.

17:57.505 --> 17:59.906
Even if I didn't get
credit, I'd still do it.

18:02.283 --> 18:06.872
Um, okay. Working at my
dad's office is not fun.

18:07.209 --> 18:10.111
Parties and hanging out with my friends,

18:10.121 --> 18:11.643
- that's fun.
- Oh.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.022
Mmm-hmm.

18:14.242 --> 18:17.137
But that's all soon coming to an end.

18:17.857 --> 18:21.518
My dad is insisting I find some
kind of school club to join.

18:21.551 --> 18:25.051
- And what's wrong with that?
- I'm not a club kind of guy.

18:25.267 --> 18:26.961
You don't know that until you try.

18:26.971 --> 18:28.637
Oh, I did.

18:29.160 --> 18:32.030
Chess club is for nerds, I
have no interest in track,

18:32.062 --> 18:35.766
I can't sing, and math
club is just more school.

18:35.776 --> 18:38.669
Seriously, why would anyone do this?

18:38.703 --> 18:41.553
There's a club out there
just waiting for you.

18:41.563 --> 18:42.728
Really?

18:43.246 --> 18:44.596
I have a feeling.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.947
Okay, well, I have a feeling
that if you don't help me,

18:48.980 --> 18:51.580
I'm gonna flunk my history test tomorrow.

18:54.692 --> 18:57.358
I have a feeling you're right.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.006
Okay!

19:11.668 --> 19:16.039
I checked Alexis's room.
That bed is as right as rain.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.209
Face it, Ms. Valet
Parking is just difficult.

19:20.143 --> 19:21.712
You missed dinner.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.744
- I had a big...
- Date?

19:24.104 --> 19:25.370
Order.

19:25.849 --> 19:27.734
Alexis has allergies.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.773
As if.

19:30.154 --> 19:31.955
That is two arrangements in one day.

19:31.989 --> 19:33.991
I think she's taking
advantage of our hospitality.

19:34.001 --> 19:35.511
Well, she offered to pay for both rooms

19:35.521 --> 19:37.506
and she did return the
original arrangement.

19:37.516 --> 19:39.831
I'm just saying. When
somebody is that difficult,

19:39.864 --> 19:41.915
there's something else going on.

19:45.129 --> 19:47.618
George, would you mind taking care
of the guest breakfast tomorrow?

19:47.628 --> 19:48.927
Sure.

19:49.148 --> 19:50.468
Where are you gonna be?

19:50.478 --> 19:52.478
Right now, it's up in the air.

19:53.478 --> 19:55.670
Okay. Consider it done.

19:59.310 --> 20:01.687
Guess what, Mom? He's a lawyer.

20:01.697 --> 20:05.319
He is smart and handsome and successful.

20:05.510 --> 20:07.360
But he's not self-involved.

20:08.158 --> 20:12.158
In fact, we ended up talking mostly
about what I do, and what I like.

20:13.411 --> 20:14.799
He's perfect.

20:14.809 --> 20:18.309
Perfect on paper doesn't
necessarily mean perfect for you.

20:18.601 --> 20:20.864
You've met this "perfect" man,

20:20.874 --> 20:23.779
but I think you're
still thinking about Ben.

20:26.353 --> 20:27.978
I love you.

20:28.147 --> 20:30.047
I just want you to be happy,

20:32.193 --> 20:34.168
which means I don't want you

20:34.178 --> 20:37.428
to miss out on what could
be a wonderful relationship.

20:37.721 --> 20:40.991
The time for talking is over, Stephanie.

20:41.023 --> 20:43.763
Make a move. Take some action.

20:44.775 --> 20:48.353
Win or lose, you're gonna feel
better than you do right now.

20:49.433 --> 20:51.399
Come see me again soon, Mom.

20:52.911 --> 20:54.395
You don't have to say that.

20:54.604 --> 20:56.316
I say it because I mean it.

20:57.615 --> 21:00.282
You could come and see me too.

21:00.652 --> 21:02.692
I just might take you up on that.

21:05.108 --> 21:06.856
I'm hoping you do.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.214
Come on in, Sam.

21:16.721 --> 21:18.934
- You expecting somebody?
- Only you.

21:20.001 --> 21:21.951
I was really craving dessert.

21:22.566 --> 21:24.434
You figured out where we're going tomorrow?

21:24.467 --> 21:26.742
I told you I want it to be a surprise.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.391
- Well, I do love surprises.
- That's the point.

21:29.973 --> 21:32.345
For the record, I don't
like to be surprised.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.078
Never?

21:34.110 --> 21:36.616
When I was a kid, at
Christmas I would sneak down,

21:36.626 --> 21:38.776
open my presents and rewrap them.

21:38.934 --> 21:42.369
- And the end of a good novel?
- Always read the last chapter first.

21:42.379 --> 21:44.588
Even when Linda didn't want
to know the sex of the baby,

21:44.620 --> 21:46.779
I bribed her doctor with
courtside Knicks tickets.

21:46.789 --> 21:48.204
- No.
- True.

21:48.214 --> 21:52.429
Well, I think surprises are
what make life interesting.

21:53.453 --> 21:54.665
I disagree.

21:54.697 --> 21:56.545
I think it's the choices we make in life

21:56.555 --> 21:58.292
that create things to be interested in.

21:58.302 --> 21:59.577
Hmm.

22:01.230 --> 22:02.673
Have you ever?

22:02.824 --> 22:04.874
Not since college days.

22:05.397 --> 22:08.736
- Bet you'd be cute in the helmet.
- Yeah, I am. You ever done it?

22:08.746 --> 22:12.232
Yeah, when I was in South America
with Doctors Without Borders. Tried it.

22:12.242 --> 22:13.492
You gonna go?

22:13.502 --> 22:16.214
John asked. He's zip-lined
all over the world.

22:16.224 --> 22:17.473
You should go.

22:17.483 --> 22:21.417
Oh, no. My adrenaline
days are safely in my past.

22:22.076 --> 22:23.587
Never say never.

22:24.694 --> 22:27.394
Never know what's going to give you a rush.

22:45.486 --> 22:47.323
- You ready?
- John.

22:48.091 --> 22:50.243
Hi, cuz. Sorry I'm late,

22:50.253 --> 22:51.982
I'm not really a morning person.

22:51.992 --> 22:54.022
What are you doing here so early?

22:54.032 --> 22:55.867
I'm here so that you can go zip-lining,

22:55.899 --> 22:57.887
which is something I hear
you used to do a lot of.

22:57.897 --> 23:00.518
You said you couldn't go because
there was no one to open the store.

23:00.528 --> 23:03.341
- Now there is.
- Uh-huh, and what about your store?

23:03.374 --> 23:06.824
Ugh. It is way too early for
anybody to be buying flowers.

23:07.145 --> 23:09.494
It's actually way too
early for me to be up,

23:09.504 --> 23:12.118
- before I change my mind.
- Come on, we won't be long.

23:12.128 --> 23:13.858
And it'll be worth it!

23:14.119 --> 23:17.043
- You have no excuses left!
- No, I don't.

23:17.988 --> 23:19.836
You are the king of adventure.

23:19.846 --> 23:23.614
You used to be the queen.
Question is, are you still?

23:40.911 --> 23:43.558
You know, if you sync the calendars,

23:43.568 --> 23:46.568
you won't have to input
the information manually.

23:46.818 --> 23:48.744
That is what I was about to do.

23:49.286 --> 23:50.660
Right.

23:52.452 --> 23:55.610
- Do you want me to show you how?
- Oh, no. I've got it.

23:55.620 --> 23:56.776
Okay.

23:57.896 --> 24:01.100
Oh, and I reorganized the billing files.

24:01.110 --> 24:04.860
I think it's a better system,
but you let me know your thoughts.

24:07.435 --> 24:11.485
And if it's not better by the end
of the week, please, give me a call.

24:11.709 --> 24:13.930
- Hey!
- You're here early today.

24:13.940 --> 24:17.082
Yeah, it's a late start at
school. No morning classes.

24:17.114 --> 24:19.245
- Is that okay?
- Absolutely.

24:19.783 --> 24:23.155
Oh, and if I come back after school too?

24:23.187 --> 24:24.775
- I love the enthusiasm.
- Great.

24:24.785 --> 24:26.824
Oh, and if you haven't gotten
those tickets for that play,

24:26.834 --> 24:30.118
they're selling them at my
school, so I can get them for you.

24:30.128 --> 24:32.297
I was thinking about
something more exciting,

24:32.330 --> 24:34.348
but I might need your help for one detail.

24:34.639 --> 24:35.649
I'm there.

24:35.659 --> 24:37.665
How about I buy you an early
lunch and I'll fill you in?

24:37.675 --> 24:39.560
Yeah. Let me get my coat.

24:40.405 --> 24:42.407
- Uh, Eve!
- Yeah?

24:42.439 --> 24:45.721
- Can we bring you something back?
- Back, right. Um...

24:46.631 --> 24:48.598
- It's okay, I'm good.
- Okay.

25:06.303 --> 25:07.586
Hey.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.171
Hi.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.599
My mom was sorry she didn't get a chance

25:12.609 --> 25:15.009
to say goodbye to you before she left.

25:15.039 --> 25:17.336
She's very sweet and fun.

25:18.556 --> 25:21.556
Well, we had a surprisingly
good visit this time.

25:21.946 --> 25:23.782
- I'm glad.
- Me too.

25:26.244 --> 25:27.583
What are you up to?

25:28.367 --> 25:29.715
Working a job.

25:30.924 --> 25:32.628
- How about you?
- Ah,

25:32.738 --> 25:35.438
grabbing some lettuce. Supplier shorted me.

25:35.516 --> 25:36.709
Oh.

25:38.263 --> 25:39.831
Well, look, I gotta get home.

25:39.863 --> 25:42.613
I promised my sister
I'd help with the kids.

25:43.133 --> 25:44.389
Okay.

25:55.785 --> 25:57.096
Ah!

25:57.106 --> 25:59.518
- That was such a blast.
- What?

25:59.764 --> 26:02.020
- I said that was a total rush!
- I'm sorry,

26:02.053 --> 26:04.488
someone screamed so loud my
ears are still ringing... Ow!

26:04.522 --> 26:06.892
First my ears, now my arm. All right.

26:07.058 --> 26:09.294
I do want to say that for
someone who seems so delicate,

26:09.326 --> 26:11.028
your scream really packs a punch.

26:11.038 --> 26:12.968
I just forgot what it's like to have your

26:12.978 --> 26:15.533
heart leap out of your chest, so thank you.

26:15.566 --> 26:17.835
Let's do dinner later.

26:17.869 --> 26:19.500
Oh, I have plans with Sam.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.248
Next time I'll get my invite in earlier.

26:22.258 --> 26:23.908
Next time I'm buying.

26:23.941 --> 26:25.728
- Okay, deal.
- Okay.

26:26.665 --> 26:28.504
- Hey, Cass.
- Yeah?

26:29.078 --> 26:31.736
That was a real blast
from the past, wasn't it?

26:31.746 --> 26:32.966
Yeah.

26:42.394 --> 26:44.594
Hi, there. I'll be right with you.

26:44.896 --> 26:47.030
Oh, hello.

26:47.292 --> 26:48.876
Dr. Radford's office.

26:50.069 --> 26:53.483
Yes, we have you down for
tomorrow at 3:00, Mrs. Eliot.

26:55.664 --> 26:56.941
Goodbye.

26:56.975 --> 26:58.434
Mrs. Logan.

26:58.671 --> 27:00.154
Call me Julie.

27:00.164 --> 27:02.459
Dr. Radford wants me to see an opta...

27:02.469 --> 27:04.080
Ophthalmologist.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.351
Yes. The office can set up
that appointment for you.

27:06.383 --> 27:07.995
Oh, that's sweet.

27:08.585 --> 27:12.256
Oh, and I believe that this is for you.

27:12.290 --> 27:14.839
Dr. Radford will be right
out, if you have any questions.

27:14.849 --> 27:17.362
- Thank you, uh...
- I'm Grace.

27:18.630 --> 27:20.874
Dr. Radford, she is a keeper.

27:20.884 --> 27:22.459
- Aw.
- I know.

27:22.469 --> 27:24.068
- Bye, Eve.
- Bye, honey.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.686
- She's an amazing kid.
- She is.

27:37.415 --> 27:39.618
- Help.
- Tara?

27:39.650 --> 27:41.418
She's gone totally baby-crazy.

27:41.451 --> 27:45.064
She's buying furniture,
making me eat beans and kale

27:45.074 --> 27:46.484
and every time I talk to her,

27:46.494 --> 27:48.260
she finds a way to bring
whatever we're talking about

27:48.293 --> 27:51.132
back to baby stuff. It's too much.

27:51.142 --> 27:54.774
I'm happy to report that
your faucet is now leak-free.

27:54.784 --> 27:56.534
Thank you for stopping by on short notice.

27:56.566 --> 27:58.636
Please. You've done so much for my sister.

27:58.669 --> 28:02.219
As long as I'm around, I promise
your sinks will never leak.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.224
You remember Ben.

28:04.234 --> 28:06.144
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey, Brandon.

28:06.466 --> 28:07.750
Oh, whoops!

28:08.612 --> 28:10.047
- Oh, gosh.
- No problem.

28:11.114 --> 28:13.259
That's nice. Is that new?

28:14.084 --> 28:16.884
Yeah, the artist just
dropped them off today.

28:17.067 --> 28:19.408
The pretty periwinkle crystal is agate.

28:19.418 --> 28:21.126
It's very calming.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.832
Huh. I don't really think it's my style.

28:23.842 --> 28:25.842
Maybe she means for your wife.

28:26.030 --> 28:28.966
Sorry, plumbers tend to hear everything.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.519
Well, I don't know anything about agate,

28:30.529 --> 28:33.971
but at this point, if it'll
calm Tara down, I'm there.

28:33.981 --> 28:35.994
I promise it'll have the desired effect.

28:36.004 --> 28:38.608
- It's my gift to both of you.
- Thank you.

28:40.378 --> 28:42.186
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

28:42.897 --> 28:44.410
Oh, I wanted to let you know that

28:44.420 --> 28:46.239
I might not be around
much for the next month.

28:46.249 --> 28:47.537
But if you need me, just text.

28:47.547 --> 28:49.676
- Oh, where are you going?
- I'm thinking of putting in

28:49.686 --> 28:52.017
a bid for a job over in Barrington.

28:52.027 --> 28:55.978
Small office complex, but they need
somebody to install the plumbing.

28:55.988 --> 28:58.595
It would be a commute, but a lot of money.

28:58.629 --> 29:00.290
I'm sure you'll make the right choice.

29:03.897 --> 29:06.526
Oh, I'm glad you found
some things you like.

29:06.792 --> 29:08.707
Oh, what's that smell?

29:08.739 --> 29:12.270
- Champagne ginger.
- Oh, I love it. And this scarf.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.211
It's the perfect color for your skin tone.

29:14.245 --> 29:16.074
Um, I didn't bring my wallet with me.

29:16.084 --> 29:18.049
Do you think I could just
charge all this to my room?

29:18.082 --> 29:19.216
- Of course.
- Great.

29:19.249 --> 29:21.151
And could you wrap it up and
bring it back to Grey House?

29:21.185 --> 29:22.946
Sure. Do you want to know the total?

29:22.956 --> 29:25.156
Oh, no. Whatever it is,
just charge it to my room.

29:25.188 --> 29:28.125
- You're still leaving tomorrow?
- Yes, sadly.

29:28.158 --> 29:31.196
All right, we'll settle up
then. Um, how's your brother?

29:31.228 --> 29:33.982
Um, I'm actually about to go meet him now.

29:34.520 --> 29:37.067
Do you think that George could
print out my boarding pass?

29:37.101 --> 29:40.901
- You're welcome to use our computer.
- Uh, no. George can do it.

29:49.714 --> 29:51.664
I'll get it fixed right away.

29:53.717 --> 29:56.617
Have the chef to redo
this without any parsley.

29:58.688 --> 30:00.524
She doesn't like parsley?

30:00.558 --> 30:03.283
The list of things that
woman doesn't like is long,

30:03.293 --> 30:04.562
very long.

30:04.779 --> 30:06.130
Tell me about it.

30:06.164 --> 30:08.266
I've redone two flower
arrangements already.

30:08.299 --> 30:10.825
Ah, she's staying at Grey House.

30:11.201 --> 30:12.569
George has her checkout date circled

30:12.602 --> 30:14.706
on the calendar with a smiley face.

30:14.738 --> 30:17.903
Sometimes, the hardest
part about customer service,

30:17.913 --> 30:19.443
the customers.

30:22.830 --> 30:25.580
Any idea who the new
cute guy is she's with?

30:25.649 --> 30:29.377
Nope. Whoever he is, he's very generous.

30:29.387 --> 30:30.548
Yeah?

30:30.558 --> 30:32.992
She ordered the most expensive
bottle of wine on the menu

30:33.002 --> 30:35.168
and asked if I had truffles.

30:35.258 --> 30:37.158
They're in season, you know.

30:39.056 --> 30:40.656
What are you thinking?

30:41.332 --> 30:43.432
I'm thinking he could do better.

31:05.356 --> 31:07.506
Grace is waiting for you outside.

31:08.091 --> 31:09.860
She's excited to take her test.

31:09.870 --> 31:13.231
She is. Oh, and, good luck on your date.

31:14.539 --> 31:18.069
If it looks like a date and
sounds like a date, it's a date.

31:18.101 --> 31:19.200
Hmm.

31:20.265 --> 31:23.070
You know, other than just now,
you've been kind of quiet today.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.937
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

31:26.144 --> 31:27.712
How's Grace's training coming?

31:27.744 --> 31:30.463
Oh, Grace has caught on very quickly.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.488
- I can tell.
- Yeah.

31:32.498 --> 31:34.184
In fact, if you ever need to replace me,

31:34.217 --> 31:35.898
Grace would be a very good candidate.

31:35.908 --> 31:38.489
Well, I'm glad you think so highly of her.

31:38.522 --> 31:41.116
- And that you are getting along.
- We are.

31:41.927 --> 31:44.194
I noticed the billing
files are reorganized.

31:44.227 --> 31:45.999
- Right.
- Good job.

31:46.299 --> 31:47.782
- Thanks.
- It's a

31:47.792 --> 31:50.290
better system than we were using before.

31:50.300 --> 31:52.135
So, keep up the good work.

31:52.508 --> 31:53.756
Will do.

32:00.922 --> 32:02.288
Oh!

32:02.525 --> 32:03.672
Cassie!

32:04.554 --> 32:07.012
I need something to de-stress.

32:07.022 --> 32:09.253
Something to clear your mind
and help you focus on a problem?

32:09.287 --> 32:12.057
- Yes!
- Have you ever tried yoga?

32:12.176 --> 32:14.962
Downward dog does not become me.

32:15.626 --> 32:18.097
Michael wants to start a car service

32:18.329 --> 32:20.059
in Blairsville!

32:20.697 --> 32:23.635
- I can see the headlines now,
- "Mayor of Middleton's son

32:23.667 --> 32:26.670
chooses rival town to open business."

32:26.704 --> 32:28.373
Why not open a business here?

32:28.406 --> 32:31.341
Sadly, there is no great
need for limos in Middleton.

32:31.375 --> 32:34.145
- Mmm-hmm.
- He's asked us to invest in it.

32:34.177 --> 32:37.549
In him, really, and Tom says no.

32:37.740 --> 32:39.325
Hmm. How about you?

32:41.284 --> 32:44.421
When you opened your
store, did you have help?

32:44.454 --> 32:47.138
I had to put up Grey House
to secure my first loan.

32:47.148 --> 32:48.860
You were willing to lose your home.

32:48.893 --> 32:52.652
Well, a bank has to see something
tangible before they'll give you money.

32:52.662 --> 32:54.108
You mean "loan".

32:54.308 --> 32:56.675
Isn't that what I said?
No, you said "give".

32:56.685 --> 32:58.200
Well, if the bank had truly

32:58.210 --> 33:01.510
given me money, they wouldn't
expect me to pay it back.

33:01.754 --> 33:03.666
That's very true.

33:06.610 --> 33:07.766
Hmm...

33:08.279 --> 33:09.535
Hmm!

33:22.348 --> 33:24.662
I still can't believe that I did it!

33:24.694 --> 33:26.798
You killed it! Perfect score!

33:26.808 --> 33:28.131
I mean, the driving instructor could not

33:28.141 --> 33:30.223
stop raving about my parallel parking.

33:30.233 --> 33:32.302
- Thanks to you.
- Well...

33:32.336 --> 33:34.384
I am going to go tell Mom. Thank you!

33:34.394 --> 33:36.507
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!
- Congratulations!

33:36.540 --> 33:38.711
Ah! I'll see you later!

33:39.792 --> 33:41.021
Nick!

33:41.176 --> 33:42.377
Hey!

33:42.912 --> 33:44.305
Uh...

33:44.496 --> 33:47.027
- I found it.
- Something to do after school?

33:47.037 --> 33:49.387
Yeah. I'm gonna do a semester abroad.

33:49.942 --> 33:51.061
What?

33:51.071 --> 33:52.571
I'm going to London!

33:53.202 --> 33:54.685
- In London?
- Yeah, there's

33:54.695 --> 33:57.044
this really cool teacher
who runs the program,

33:57.054 --> 33:59.110
he talked about it in
front of the whole school.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.703
- I have him for world history.
- Okay...

34:01.713 --> 34:04.219
It'll look great on my college application.

34:04.229 --> 34:06.168
You wanna go to school?

34:07.405 --> 34:09.500
In London, yeah.

34:10.942 --> 34:14.079
Okay, that's something
we can discuss, sure.

34:14.723 --> 34:16.498
What is there to discuss?

34:16.507 --> 34:19.574
You told me to find something
that I'm passionate about

34:19.583 --> 34:20.876
and I did.

34:21.596 --> 34:22.925
This is it.

34:23.877 --> 34:25.634
This is what I wanna do.

34:38.226 --> 34:39.647
Well?

34:40.804 --> 34:42.860
I did it, I passed!

34:43.672 --> 34:46.081
- Aw, of course you did!
- I'm so proud of you.

34:46.092 --> 34:48.284
Thanks, Mom! Abigail!

34:49.929 --> 34:51.848
I got my driver's license!

34:51.880 --> 34:54.551
- I knew you could do it.
- Aw!

34:54.583 --> 34:56.777
Did you know there's a
cab waiting out front?

34:56.786 --> 34:59.424
- Has Alexis checked out?
- No.

34:59.457 --> 35:01.859
I was just in her room,
changing her towels.

35:01.892 --> 35:04.419
She's gone. So is her luggage.

35:13.037 --> 35:15.940
- Latch on the trunk won't catch.
- Well, we really need to go.

35:15.972 --> 35:17.507
Well, I can't drive with an open trunk.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.890
- Well, can you hurry it up?
- I am.

35:21.064 --> 35:22.402
Alexis.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.595
Leaving so soon?

35:35.760 --> 35:37.648
Aw, it's beautiful.

35:37.827 --> 35:39.644
And so thoughtful!

35:40.731 --> 35:42.533
You know, maybe I have
been getting ahead of myself

35:42.566 --> 35:45.023
- with everything, but...
- Well, you're excited.

35:45.033 --> 35:46.494
I think I'm nesting.

35:46.504 --> 35:49.204
I read it in one of
the baby books I bought.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.616
You just have to slow down
just a little bit, okay?

35:51.626 --> 35:53.628
Give me time to catch up.

35:53.778 --> 35:56.859
I mean, we don't have to turn
our whole lives upside down.

35:57.251 --> 35:58.507
You're right.

35:58.915 --> 36:00.785
Let me just throw my stuff down

36:00.818 --> 36:02.723
and then we can grab something to eat?

36:02.733 --> 36:03.844
Okay.

36:15.633 --> 36:18.173
Uh, sweetheart,

36:18.634 --> 36:20.992
what happened to my den?

36:21.147 --> 36:23.105
Oh, well, I needed to see
it empty so I could get

36:23.115 --> 36:26.415
a sense of the space before
I ordered a changing table.

36:27.257 --> 36:29.943
You know, I really love my bracelet.

36:34.657 --> 36:35.823
Okay.

36:39.043 --> 36:41.228
Hey, Mom! For you,

36:41.483 --> 36:43.794
your favorite, the little
fruit tarts that you love.

36:43.827 --> 36:46.632
Oh, you are so sweet!

36:52.035 --> 36:55.405
Since I'm here, can I grab the check
and I'll just run it over to the bank?

36:55.439 --> 36:57.541
- The check?
- Well, the investment.

36:59.035 --> 37:00.812
Michael, uh...

37:00.940 --> 37:02.790
I did speak to your father,

37:03.107 --> 37:04.510
and he said no.

37:06.517 --> 37:08.419
- Dad has no faith in me.
- Oh...

37:08.429 --> 37:09.693
But you could give me the money.

37:09.703 --> 37:12.690
Michael, I think your
business idea is inspired,

37:12.722 --> 37:15.092
and I will support you, but...

37:15.126 --> 37:18.009
I can't give you $50,000.

37:18.928 --> 37:21.566
Now, I can see that you're upset...

37:21.598 --> 37:24.027
We could go get ice cream and talk.

37:24.435 --> 37:25.550
Hmm?

37:25.796 --> 37:26.989
No?

37:27.405 --> 37:29.155
What about a mocha latte?

37:32.298 --> 37:35.283
First, let me say that I am sorry.

37:35.293 --> 37:38.716
- Sorry you got caught?
- No, I really am. I'm sorry I...

37:38.749 --> 37:41.599
Were you really going
to leave without paying?

37:42.519 --> 37:43.711
Yes.

37:44.575 --> 37:45.896
Why?

37:46.344 --> 37:49.239
- I don't have the money to pay you.
- Why?

37:51.413 --> 37:52.742
I'm broke.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.349
What are you gonna do about that?

37:57.359 --> 37:59.598
- You tell me.
- No.

38:00.335 --> 38:02.435
You need to solve this yourself.

38:04.607 --> 38:06.577
Let's sleep on it

38:06.609 --> 38:09.068
and talk again in the morning.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.553
Okay.

38:17.085 --> 38:20.654
- I think we should call the police.
- Or her father.

38:21.624 --> 38:23.884
- I don't trust her.
- Neither do I.

38:23.894 --> 38:26.088
Trust isn't Alexis's problem.

38:53.161 --> 38:54.534
Horseback riding?

38:54.544 --> 38:56.594
Surprised?

38:56.684 --> 38:59.788
I am! Wow, Sam, they are beautiful!

38:59.798 --> 39:01.680
Yeah, you see that little
chestnut, over there?

39:01.690 --> 39:02.964
- Yeah.
- She's yours.

39:02.974 --> 39:06.038
Mine? I can't... I can't
ride a horse like this!

39:06.048 --> 39:07.448
I got you covered.

39:08.815 --> 39:10.640
Hmm... You had help.

39:10.673 --> 39:13.138
I got this amazing new intern.

39:13.148 --> 39:15.480
Who, thanks to you, is
now a licensed driver.

39:15.513 --> 39:17.576
Well, that's another reason to celebrate.

39:17.586 --> 39:20.720
- It's a good thing we're here.
- Grace says everything should be here.

39:20.730 --> 39:24.023
Yeah, she's very thorough and
you are adventurous and prepared.

39:24.033 --> 39:25.881
A rare combination.

39:26.915 --> 39:28.132
I didn't know you ride.

39:28.142 --> 39:30.823
I've got an uncle who has
a cattle ranch in Montana.

39:30.833 --> 39:32.696
I spent summers there when I was a kid.

39:32.729 --> 39:34.445
Well, you always learn
something new, right?

39:37.069 --> 39:39.813
Well, this is beautiful and very sweet,

39:39.823 --> 39:42.285
but I haven't been on a horse in years.

39:42.295 --> 39:44.517
Ah! Don't worry, I'll be there.

39:53.007 --> 39:54.208
Thanks.

39:54.963 --> 39:56.684
Can I take your order?

39:56.893 --> 39:58.882
Andrew! You're back!

39:59.592 --> 40:02.659
That sinus thing Cassie
gave me, it really worked.

40:02.693 --> 40:05.320
Well, she's very good
at fixing what ails you.

40:05.330 --> 40:07.565
How's your client?

40:07.575 --> 40:09.678
Judge ruled in favor of my last motion.

40:09.688 --> 40:11.635
Well, congratulations!

40:11.972 --> 40:14.479
- Being a lawyer must be stressful.
- It can be.

40:14.489 --> 40:16.319
I like to get away to decompress.

40:16.329 --> 40:19.180
- Do you have a favorite place?
- London.

40:19.190 --> 40:20.424
Ah.

40:22.860 --> 40:24.053
Tell me.

40:25.198 --> 40:26.473
They were both...

40:41.646 --> 40:43.030
She's a beauty.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.063
Your horse, Maddie.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.493
Well, I hope she takes it easy on me.

40:47.503 --> 40:49.584
Oh, she will. Won't you, Maddie?

40:49.594 --> 40:51.841
- Hello.
- Are you ready?

40:52.155 --> 40:53.853
Ready as I'll ever be!

40:53.863 --> 40:55.785
Oh, you two are gonna
be great. Need some help?

40:55.795 --> 40:56.951
Sure!

41:01.555 --> 41:02.812
I got you.

41:03.468 --> 41:05.335
Yes, you do, don't you?

41:09.168 --> 41:10.406
Phew!

You really are your mother's
daughter, aren't you?

41:26.005 --> 41:27.006
I am.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.761
- I want to go in London.
- London?

41:31.771 --> 41:34.121
You can come too. It will be a blast.

41:34.984 --> 41:38.061
...hospital. They offered
me their Ghief of Stuff job.

41:38.071 --> 41:39.881
And what about your practice here?

41:42.049 --> 41:44.780
- To the future.
- That one we are connected.
