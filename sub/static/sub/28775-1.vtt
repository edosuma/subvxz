<i>Um, I guess I missed
you this morning.</i>

01:43.637 --> 01:45.671
<i>So, hey, I've got to work
a little late tonight,</i>

01:45.773 --> 01:48.107
<i>I don't know if you've
got something planned.</i>

01:48.209 --> 01:50.309
<i>But, uh, anyway,
I'll see you later. Love you!</i>

01:56.484 --> 01:57.616
There he is!

01:58.886 --> 02:00.652
- Hi, Dan.
- Hi, buddy.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.623
- You made it!
- You made it.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.526
- Welcome to Dubai.
- Heh. Thanks.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.429
Yeah, please enjoy
our beautiful airport

02:10.531 --> 02:13.232
before our final destination,
freakin' Thailand.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.334
- Yay, Thailand.
- Yeah!

02:17.571 --> 02:19.638
It's good to see you.
It's been forever.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.707
Yeah, when was the last time?

02:24.445 --> 02:25.327
Marcy's wedding.

02:25.328 --> 02:26.210
- Oh wow.
- That was two years ago.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.715
Well thanks for coming. I know
it's, uh, such short notice.

02:30.217 --> 02:33.252
What, are you kidding? This is an amazing
invite. We're gonna have so much fun.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.355
I got us matching floral shirts.
And I gotta be in Greece

02:36.457 --> 02:38.423
next week, so this
gets me half the way there.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.926
- It's perfect.
- Good. Where're you, where're you, coming from?

02:41.228 --> 02:42.161
Fiji.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.299
Hello, could I get
a beer and, uh?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.701
- Oh, I'm okay.
- Just for me then.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.608
What do you think that is?

02:58.679 --> 02:59.711
Um, I don't know.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.851
Thank you. No, I got it.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.327
You're not curious why
they keep saying that?

03:15.629 --> 03:16.795
If-non, if-non?

03:18.199 --> 03:19.865
Maybe it's the word
for a flight?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.301
Maybe it's a secret password.

03:23.771 --> 03:24.703
Check it.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.738
If-non, if-non?

03:30.244 --> 03:30.976
If-non, if-non.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.618
We gonna talk about it?

03:41.755 --> 03:43.822
I think Vanessa's
cheating on me.

03:44.825 --> 03:45.924
She, um--

03:48.829 --> 03:50.696
Uh, she always wanted
to play guitar,

03:50.931 --> 03:54.299
so I-- I bought her
one and lessons

03:54.602 --> 03:58.637
and then she's in
a band with her teacher

03:59.240 --> 04:01.807
and, uh, she's really happy

04:02.543 --> 04:05.877
for like the first time
in a while, you know?

04:06.780 --> 04:07.713
Uh--

04:09.950 --> 04:11.817
I mean, I should
have known, right?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.885
They had such good
chemistry onstage.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.291
Okay.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.827
Then the question
you gotta answer is,

04:21.928 --> 04:23.862
do you wanna
fight for it or not?

04:26.967 --> 04:30.269
- That's really oversimplifying it.
- No, it's not.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.405
Everything's on either
side of that question.

04:33.707 --> 04:37.542
You wanna fight for it or not?
You answer that, everything follows.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.375
- Maybe later on, okay, bye.
- No thank you.

06:24.118 --> 06:26.651
- Welcome to The Slate.
- Oh, thank you.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.886
Welcome.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.022
Nice.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.166
Hello, welcome
to The Slate, Phuket.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.602
- You are checking in?
- Ah, yes.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.438
It should be under,
uh, Brandon Matthews.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.472
Just a moment, sir.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.442
Ah, here it is.

06:51.512 --> 06:55.514
Ooh, our honeymoon suite
for the happy couple.

06:55.849 --> 06:59.818
Actually, would it be possible
to get two rooms, please.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.922
Everything, it's okay
with your marriage?

07:04.591 --> 07:05.657
- Ah.
- Hmm.

07:05.659 --> 07:08.693
Yeah, I-- I was supposed
to be here with my wife,

07:08.796 --> 07:12.898
- but, um, instead, you know.
- Instead, I see.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.999
No, no.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.500
It's all good.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.436
Uh, Suchin?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.738
Suchin, we just need two rooms.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.140
Yes, I understand.

07:24.044 --> 07:24.976
Shh.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.618
So here you see
your wonderful room

07:33.720 --> 07:35.921
and also bathroom.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.924
Suchin, you shouldn't have.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.626
But this is your anniversary.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.763
It was with my wife, but--

07:45.866 --> 07:46.798
I know.

07:51.038 --> 07:55.240
So here you see the adjourning
door to your friend's room.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.125
Well, this
is perfect, thank you.

08:14.228 --> 08:18.063
Yes, welcome to Thailand.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.636
This is lovely.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.739
Happy anniversary.

08:28.909 --> 08:29.975
Happy anniversary.

08:29.977 --> 08:33.645
You wanna get settled, meet up
for dinner say, couple of hours.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.679
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Okay.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.883
I will be in my room
if you need me.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.259
Shh.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.330
- <i> No, no, I-- I got it Nan.</i>
- Dad.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.899
<i>- Hey, son, how are you, pal?
- Is that Brandon?</i>

09:28.001 --> 09:30.135
<i>- Yeah, it's Brandon.
- Hi, Brandon.</i>

09:30.237 --> 09:32.837
- Hi, mom. <i>-Hey, listen, buddy,
we're on our way out to dinner.</i>

09:32.940 --> 09:34.906
<i>Uh, oh, you remember
the Berensteins, right?</i>

09:35.008 --> 09:36.775
- Of course.
<i>-  He remembers the Berensteins.</i>

09:36.877 --> 09:37.943
<i> Oh, do that-- Well it</i>
<i>doesn't matter. Anyway,</i>

09:38.045 --> 09:39.244
<i>is, is everything okay, buddy?</i>

09:39.713 --> 09:42.714
Yeah, ha-- have a great dinner.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.251
- <i> Okay, all right, I l-- I love you, son.</i>
<i>-  I love you!</i>

09:46.887 --> 09:48.720
- Love you guys.
<i>-  Take care, my friend.</i>

10:47.781 --> 10:48.713
Fiji.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.169
Welcome, my dear friends.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.305
We have prepared
a lovely table for you.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.144
Suchin, did you close
the place for us?

11:19.246 --> 11:22.714
Now is rainy season,
so not many guests.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.316
Well, this is
perfect, thank you.

11:26.286 --> 11:30.021
Tonight will be a special
dinner just for you.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.824
Oh, you didn't need
to make a fuss.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.093
Oh, we should have worn
our matching shirts.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.964
Ah, this is your waiter, okay?
I leave you now.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.167
Thank you, wait-- uh, Suchin.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.836
How do you say
thank you in Thai?

11:45.138 --> 11:47.038
If you're a man, you would say,

11:49.076 --> 11:50.942
A woman would say,

11:54.281 --> 11:55.213
Wonderful.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.282
Have a good night.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.050
Thank you.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.053
- Drink?
- Ah, yes, uh,

12:02.155 --> 12:04.489
two shots of whisky and
do you have Chang in a bottle?

12:05.759 --> 12:06.491
Perfect.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.460
Oh, I-- I don't wanna drink.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.495
- Yeah, you do.
- I do?

12:10.797 --> 12:12.797
Yeah, you remember on
the plane you were telling me,

12:12.899 --> 12:15.133
you were like, "Dan, I'm sleeping,
but listen to me carefully.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.103
Make sure I drink a whole lot, like a weird amount."

12:18.205 --> 12:19.337
- So.
- That sounds just like me.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.438
Yeah, you sound a lot like that.

12:20.741 --> 12:21.773
It's funny, you don't hear it,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.174
but when I hear it, "Dan, Dan,"

12:23.276 --> 12:24.509
- it's how you sound.
- Hmh.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.783
Thank you.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.788
Buddy, we're gonna
get you through it.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.124
Thanks.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.799
So, what happened?
You saw an email?

12:49.536 --> 12:51.302
Um, yeah, several.

12:51.404 --> 12:56.107
She hid him under her
best friend's name

12:56.209 --> 12:58.777
so that when...

12:58.879 --> 13:00.311
...they texted
I would think it was her.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.281
That's some sneaky shit.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.985
What did she say
when you caught her?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.486
No, she doesn't know I know.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.891
What are you talking about.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.462
This was gonna be a surprise.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.565
And then I saw the--

13:21.835 --> 13:22.967
You just left?

13:22.969 --> 13:29.207
- Vanessa doesn't know about the trip or anything?
- No, I never told her.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.576
And then I--

13:34.948 --> 13:38.116
I couldn't confront her, so...

13:42.322 --> 13:47.258
You skipped town without
a word on your anniversary?

13:50.430 --> 13:51.362
I guess so.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.233
That's pretty badass.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.435
It doesn't feel it.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.505
Honestly, let her spin.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.075
And let's burn
this guy's house down.

14:04.878 --> 14:05.610
Hmm.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.548
- No, I don't think that's the answer.
- No?

14:12.619 --> 14:13.985
Then what is the answer?

14:15.589 --> 14:16.521
I don't wanna get divorced.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.561
Oh, Brandon.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.998
I'm not gonna kill
your wife for you.

14:27.100 --> 14:31.302
Are you sure? 'Cause that
would-- that would solve a lot.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.574
No, I can't.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.377
Not for free.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.219
<i> Ah, sorry honey,</i>
<i>I'm gonna be later.</i>

14:48.321 --> 14:49.921
<i>Uh, it's just running long.</i>

14:50.523 --> 14:52.223
<i>Don't wait up.
We can celebrate tomorrow,</i>

14:52.325 --> 14:54.025

18:14.694 --> 18:15.793
Many tree in Thailand.

18:15.795 --> 18:19.163
Wha-- I've always thought
of you as my best friend.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.532
What are we, 13?

18:21.801 --> 18:24.502
Okay, we'll get matching
necklaces, but I call beef ride?

18:25.238 --> 18:28.306
I'm-- I'm serious.
You're my best friend.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.576
I have best friend.
His name is Kye.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.714
If you were my best friend, you wouldn't
have missed my first gallery show.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.485
I went to your
first gallery show.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.354
You went to the opening of
the gallery a couple months later.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.522
I didn't have any work there.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.657
You guys want 7-11 boat?

18:47.827 --> 18:48.759
What's that?

18:49.395 --> 18:50.795
You want beer, yeah?

18:50.897 --> 18:53.264
- Oh, definitely.
- 80 baht.

18:54.134 --> 18:54.866
Make it two.

18:54.868 --> 18:58.703
Beer,.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.243
Here you go, Phang.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.453
Oh no, I-- I'm okay.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.321
- No?
- Yeah, I don't, I don't want it.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.759
Phang, Phang,
you want this beer?

19:21.861 --> 19:24.395
Dan, how old is he?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.764
I assume legal
drinking age, right?

19:27.734 --> 19:29.433
Yeah, I can drink.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.948
What? You didn't want it.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.831
Hey, um,
what was that about your show?

20:00.833 --> 20:05.403
Because it kind of sounds like you've
been harboring some secret resentment.

20:05.805 --> 20:09.507
No, I mean, it's not like I think about
it, but you did flake.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.609
Said you were gonna come
and you didn't.

20:11.611 --> 20:15.913
I think we just got too tired.
Didn't it start at midnight?

20:16.382 --> 20:19.884
Yeah, the witching hour.
'Cause the theme was Magic and Mischief.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.955
- We were in bed by midnight.
- What are you, 70?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.958
No, I had to get up for work.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.960
Did you even notice
I wasn't there?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.496
Yeah, but whatever, forget it.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.868
I'm sorry, I guess I didn't
realize it was such a big deal.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.738
It was
my first solo show.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.007
My pictures, my ideas, you--

20:43.009 --> 20:46.677
Couldn't be tired one
morning just to share that with me?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.761
I don't know, I don't know
what you want me to say. I--

21:04.364 --> 21:05.863
I wasn't trying
to hurt your feelings.

21:07.267 --> 21:10.534
Look, man, w-- uh, why are we
even talking about this?

21:10.637 --> 21:12.870
I'm not mad, okay,
let's just forget it.

21:12.972 --> 21:13.904
Have fun.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.330
You have no fun?
My tour no good?

21:39.432 --> 21:41.299
Oh, no, no, you're great, um--

21:43.736 --> 21:45.803
Very good.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.973
- What's your name?
- Brandon.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.542
Hello, Brandon,
my name Pen, like--

21:51.644 --> 21:53.344
A pen you write with,
I remember.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.085
Don't worry,
everything will be okay.

22:14.934 --> 22:19.603
Hasselblad H4D, you must
have some generous parents.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.073
Buddy, you don't know
the first thing about me.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.508
I know it's not a cheap camera.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.078
I'm a photographer.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.414
Adding filters to your iPhone
doesn't make you a photographer.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.885
Lady, you don't know
the first thing about me.

22:47.633 --> 22:51.802
<i> Okay,
here we are at historic James Bond Island,</i>

22:51.904 --> 22:54.638
<i>everybody, back on
the boat in one hour.</i>

23:11.591 --> 23:14.558
- How would I fight for this?
- What do you mean?

23:15.661 --> 23:17.962
Well, you asked me if I wanna
fight for it or not. I'm asking,

23:18.064 --> 23:19.730
how would I go about
fighting for it?

23:21.901 --> 23:23.100
What do you
like about Vanessa?

23:23.102 --> 23:25.770
- What's that supposed to mean?
- No, I'm not being

23:25.872 --> 23:27.638
confrontational. I promise.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.807
You're asking me how you fight
for it, so I'm asking you,

23:29.909 --> 23:30.841
what are you fighting for?

23:33.846 --> 23:35.346
Wha--
I don't understand.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.847
Remember when you said
you wanted to marry her?

23:37.583 --> 23:41.986
You said it was 'cause mostly she
checked the right boxes. That's not love.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.677
You just, you never liked her.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.581
I don't like how she treats you.
How you let her treat you.

24:11.684 --> 24:12.616
Or me.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.653
What are you talking about?

24:17.990 --> 24:19.990
Why didn't you invite me
to Orphan Christmas last year?

24:23.129 --> 24:26.063
- Weren't you out of town?
- No, I was in town for 16 hours.

24:26.933 --> 24:27.998
You just never called me back.

24:30.169 --> 24:34.472
- But, didn't Vanessa call you?
- Yeah, she called.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.141
I told her I could come by,
I had presents for you guys.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.009
She told me I could mail them.

24:40.213 --> 24:41.979
The dinner was just for family.

24:43.983 --> 24:47.818
Oh, well that's, you-- you know,
just because her f-- her folks were there.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.921
I'm your family, B.
You're my family.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.762
You called, I came. I
always show up. That's who I am.

24:58.865 --> 25:02.500
But-- You've
been a shitty friend.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.102

27:06.058 --> 27:08.792
That was fun. You know, me
and my buddy are gonna be here

27:08.894 --> 27:11.395
for a few days if you
wanna give me your number.

27:13.399 --> 27:16.734
- Nah.
- Okay, Brandon, you have a good vacation.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.403
- Maybe smile more.
- Eh, I'll try.

27:19.705 --> 27:21.939
If I can say, you're coming
across a little aggressive.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.907
And I understand that's
kind of my fault,

27:24.010 --> 27:25.376
I dress like this, but you know,

27:25.378 --> 27:26.844
if you wanna get
to know the real me,

27:26.946 --> 27:28.746
I don't know,
give it a shot, you know,

27:28.848 --> 27:29.980
just say the word.

27:31.751 --> 27:32.683
Not today.

27:33.919 --> 27:34.852
No, not today.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.021
I'll see you tomorrow.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.125
- Bye, Dan.
- Bye, Pen.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.702
If-non, if-non.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.075
Aren't you supposed
to fight for it?

27:58.177 --> 28:00.077
I mean, that's what
our parents did.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.815
You gotta make your own choices.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.826
It's-- It's Vanessa again.

28:16.829 --> 28:17.761
Yeah?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.266
Should I answer it?

28:22.268 --> 28:25.703
You've gone 48 hours
with zero contact?

28:29.108 --> 28:30.340
More.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.878
Are you sure
she wants to be forgiven?

28:36.749 --> 28:38.148
Maybe she wanted to get caught.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.293
Come on, let's take a walk.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.329
Okay, here's the thought.

28:52.331 --> 28:57.234
Ditch our old life,
buy a bar, retire down here.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.237
We'll live out
that buddy cop fantasy.

29:02.441 --> 29:06.043
Well, it has been a very tough
career, keeping these streets clean.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.412
That's what I'm sayin',
the commissioner's breathing down our necks

29:08.514 --> 29:11.749
and no offense to you or me,
but we're gettin'

29:11.851 --> 29:14.318
...too old for this shit.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.255
- Okay, or plan B.
- Yeah.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.158
You move back home
with your parents,

29:21.827 --> 29:23.460
- they'd love that.
- Eh.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.530
I don't-- I don't
think that's what I want.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.767
I agree, it's a good idea.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.836
No utilities,
no rent, no mortgage.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.105
You get scared at night,
you can run and sleep

29:35.207 --> 29:37.908
- between Chris and Nancy.
- Yeah, you're really sellin' it.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.244
I'm tellin' you, with your dad,
you'd double your wardrobe. Nancy can cook

29:40.346 --> 29:41.779
a mean dinner, it's perfect.

29:46.552 --> 29:47.818
Oh, we're goin' in.

30:23.355 --> 30:24.421
Take
your shoes off.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.212
Kneel down.

30:54.386 --> 30:59.256
Put your hands together
and bow three times.

31:00.993 --> 31:05.429
One for Buddha,
one for his teachings

31:07.166 --> 31:08.498
and one for this monk.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.373
Now give him your right wrist.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.166
Now put your hands
together and bow your head.

31:55.214 --> 31:56.613
Now bow three more times.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.660
- Cars. We got time? OK.
- No, we're fine. We got time.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.229
My friends,
leaving us so soon, eh?

32:46.332 --> 32:49.132
Suchin, yeah, we gotta catch
a boat to another island.

32:49.401 --> 32:50.667
Thank you for everything.

32:51.270 --> 32:54.604
Yes, my pleasure.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.174
We are never gonna forget you.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.509
And I will never
forget your love.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.085
- How cool is this shit!
- I mean it looks a little--

33:08.187 --> 33:10.287
- Don't say dangerous.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.178
Welcome, your boat
is waiting for you.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.312
Snorkel tour?

34:42.414 --> 34:43.547
Oh, yeah, we have a boat tour.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.681
- It-- It's now?
- Yes, now.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.185
We take your bags to your room.
We go now?

34:48.754 --> 34:49.853
- Okay.
- Yep.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.429
This is like a Lego boat.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.135
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:05.137 --> 35:05.869
Hi.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.340
Look at this!

35:16.515 --> 35:21.184
- Ahoy!
- Ahoy, I'm Ian. You guys must be, um--

35:23.655 --> 35:25.622
Brandon and Dave.

35:25.724 --> 35:26.656
Dan.

35:26.658 --> 35:30.193
Awesome. So come in,
come in. Um--

35:30.295 --> 35:32.629
Get ready to have your
mind blown by coral.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.866
- Hi, I'm Dan.
- Mark, nice to meet you.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.234
- Hi Mark, Dan.
- Hi, Emma.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.502
- Hi, Emma.
- Nice to meet you. Mark.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.370
- Hi, Brandon. Hi. Brandon.
- Emma.

35:41.406 --> 35:45.575
So it looks like we have some,
uh, newlyweds on the boat today.

35:45.677 --> 35:48.345
- That's us.
- Yeah, we're married now.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.547
Well, that's
what newlyweds means.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.450
Um, I hear an accent,
where you guys from?

35:53.552 --> 35:55.752
- England.
- Uh, whereabouts?

35:55.854 --> 35:57.254
- I love England.
- London.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.156
Just outside of London.

35:59.158 --> 36:02.225
Oh, you guys are
like practically neighbors.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.394
Well, we live together now.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.230
Oh, that would be
awkward if you didn't.

36:07.332 --> 36:11.635
So hold on, let me just--
"Live together now."

36:12.237 --> 36:14.804
Okay. Uh, so you guys
wanna see some coral?

36:15.407 --> 36:17.741
- Yeah!
- Yeah, me too.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.877
All right, so welcome
aboard the Golly Roger.

You're quite pale, aren't you.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.484
- I guess so.
- Do you not get out much?

38:09.855 --> 38:11.755
I guess not.

38:12.991 --> 38:14.557
Oh, don't you like coral or...?

38:15.761 --> 38:17.961
Oh, yeah, I just don't
feel like swimming.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.748
Yeah, me neither.

38:21.749 --> 38:23.566
Sometimes,
more fun to watch, eh?

38:25.871 --> 38:26.803
Right.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.642
I mean, look at her.

38:33.612 --> 38:36.413
Have you
ever seen such a beauty?

38:38.684 --> 38:39.749
She is beautiful.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.851
You tryin' to fuck my wife?

38:42.921 --> 38:48.792
- What? No.
- I'm jokin' man. [chuckles

38:48.794 --> 38:50.093
But I would kill you
without a problem.

38:55.734 --> 38:56.966
You're very high strung.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.104
Yeah.

39:17.022 --> 39:17.954
All right.

39:29.668 --> 39:33.737
So, are you enjoying Thailand?

39:34.573 --> 39:36.406
Yeah. And you live here?

39:36.975 --> 39:39.042
Uh, I do, I do.

39:39.144 --> 39:44.414
Um, you know, me and Klahan,
we, uh, we bought a boat.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.649
And we dive and we fish

39:46.651 --> 39:49.819
and we jump around
to the islands and so forth.

39:49.921 --> 39:55.658
But, uh, but yes, um,
I live in Thailand.

39:56.962 --> 40:00.063
- Are you, are you from here?
- No.

40:00.732 --> 40:04.634
No, no, I'm-- I'm-- I'm
from Hill City of South Dakota,

40:04.736 --> 40:08.138
which is the, uh,
Rapid City of South Dakota

40:08.440 --> 40:11.674
except with less
Mount Rushmore and stuff.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.744
Uh, but yes, no, I have been
living here for about--

40:15.914 --> 40:20.016
Yeah, like, ten years.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.618
How did that happen?

40:23.188 --> 40:26.890
Hum... Look, all
my buddies back in Hill City,

40:26.992 --> 40:28.591
they-- they would join
the military

40:28.660 --> 40:30.427
'cause that's
how you find a career.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.529
You know, they-- they would
just kind of settle in

40:32.631 --> 40:36.199
to these lives that just
I wanted no part of.

40:36.501 --> 40:40.837
And so I just decided
to just find a life

40:40.839 --> 40:43.039
that suited me much better.

40:43.675 --> 40:47.677
- And so, I was like uh-huh.
- Hmm.

40:48.547 --> 40:49.612
Wow.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.816
Don't you miss your life?

40:54.085 --> 40:57.520
Ho-- How could I miss a life
if I'm busy living it?

40:58.957 --> 41:01.191
- Know what I'm sayin'?
- Hey, B!

41:02.127 --> 41:04.494
Look at
that fuckin' asshole.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.496
I can see my house from here!

41:09.668 --> 41:11.801
- You can do it, Dave!
- Go on, mate!

41:17.976 --> 41:20.043
- Nice.
- Yes, mates.

41:20.712 --> 41:25.014
Woo-ho-ho, you are next!
Your turn, buddy!

41:28.253 --> 41:29.519
It's your turn, dude.

41:32.691 --> 41:33.756
Said it's your turn.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.139
Okay, come on, B!

41:51.910 --> 41:53.877
- Go on, my son.
- Do a flip!

41:53.979 --> 41:55.044
I have insurance!

42:01.019 --> 42:02.051
Oh, shit.

42:04.623 --> 42:05.722
It's okay, B.

42:06.525 --> 42:07.624
You don't have to.

42:35.654 --> 42:38.087
- You going down?
- Yeah.

42:38.189 --> 42:40.623
- You don't wanna jump?
- No.

43:16.928 --> 43:17.860
Hey.

43:19.631 --> 43:20.697
You all right?

43:22.801 --> 43:24.834
Come on, don't make
this cliff into a thing.

43:25.670 --> 43:27.770
Jumpin' off shit doesn't
solve every problem.

43:29.641 --> 43:30.840
If-non, if-non.

43:40.652 --> 43:41.985
Well, that was embarrassing.

43:44.923 --> 43:46.923
Have you guys done the hike
to the waterfall yet?

43:47.859 --> 43:49.392
We have not. What is that?

43:49.694 --> 43:51.294
It's Enlightenment Falls.

43:52.063 --> 43:54.998
It's, uh, uh, fantastic,
if you guys, uh,

43:55.100 --> 43:57.400
start now, you'll get
there before sunset.

43:58.336 --> 44:00.837
What do you say, buddy? We could
use some enlightenment, huh?

44:19.290 --> 44:21.024
- Ouch, ah!
- You all right?

44:21.960 --> 44:23.026
I'm fine, I'm fine.

44:26.231 --> 44:28.297
Didn't Ian say we'd
be okay in flip flops?

44:28.400 --> 44:29.832
He did.

45:00.265 --> 45:01.364
Oh, that's a good sign.

45:23.388 --> 45:24.320
Come on.

45:25.156 --> 45:26.222
Watch your step.

45:45.443 --> 45:46.509
Maybe you gotta get in it.

45:49.013 --> 45:50.079
I hope not.

45:51.382 --> 45:53.082
Come on, we came all this way.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.007
There you go!

46:23.248 --> 46:24.447
You're not coming in?

46:26.317 --> 46:27.450
This one's all you.

46:40.932 --> 46:41.998
Anything?

46:44.469 --> 46:45.535
I don't know!

46:47.105 --> 46:48.538
Maybe you gotta go under it?

47:16.935 --> 47:18.134
This is stupid.

47:19.037 --> 47:20.203
It's not stupid.

47:21.272 --> 47:22.839
What am I even doing out here?

47:25.944 --> 47:27.577
You wanna fight for it or not?

47:28.379 --> 47:30.580
It's not-- it's not that simple.

47:31.416 --> 47:34.016
It actually is that simple.

47:35.086 --> 47:36.285
I gotta go home.

47:37.889 --> 47:40.289
- Buddy look, we can figure out--
- I wanna go home.

48:08.453 --> 48:11.187
<i> Hey, where are you?</i>
<i>Uh, it's been almost two days.</i>

48:11.289 --> 48:14.123

48:14.225 --> 48:16.092

48:26.971 --> 48:28.204
We're going to the bar with Ian.

48:30.541 --> 48:31.641
You can do whatever you want.

48:34.279 --> 48:36.379
We're going to the bar with Ian.

48:50.628 --> 48:52.161
There's the happy couple!

48:52.263 --> 48:54.263

54:09.247 --> 54:14.016

Well, guys, tonight is gonna be

54:16.954 --> 54:18.787
the greatest night of our lives.

54:20.958 --> 54:22.291
O-- Okay.

54:25.563 --> 54:27.930
- Brandon.
- Yeah?

54:28.633 --> 54:33.769
Tonight is gonna be
the greatest night of our lives.

54:35.306 --> 54:37.573
- Okay.
- Brandon, look me in the eye.

54:38.876 --> 54:39.808
Am I lyin'?

54:42.380 --> 54:43.412
- No?
- No.

54:44.382 --> 54:46.015
Because I always tell the truth.

54:46.951 --> 54:48.550
Shots for everybody!

54:52.390 --> 54:53.822
- Here you go, boys.
- Oh, thanks.

54:53.924 --> 54:54.857
All right.

54:56.627 --> 54:59.795

- Goongala!

55:01.499 --> 55:02.431
Ow!

55:02.433 --> 55:05.701
- Oh, four buckets please!
- Strong buckets?

55:05.970 --> 55:07.870
- Strong as you got.
- Yeah.

55:08.406 --> 55:10.306
Even Stefan,
getting the first legs,

55:10.408 --> 55:12.675
because they're doppelgangers.

55:12.777 --> 55:14.610
Yeah, take that in.

55:14.712 --> 55:17.479
They're cursed to be forever
intertwined again and again,

55:17.581 --> 55:19.014
always ending in tragedy.

55:19.317 --> 55:20.916
But, Elena's love for Damon's

55:21.018 --> 55:22.751
stronger than
the doppelganger curse.

55:22.753 --> 55:24.486
He knows that that
made it okay for her

55:24.488 --> 55:25.888
to date both brothers at once
without being a whore.

55:25.990 --> 55:28.624
I mean, that is storytelling.

55:28.726 --> 55:30.359
Fuck Aaron Mikaelson.

55:30.828 --> 55:31.760
Pe-- Pen.

55:31.762 --> 55:34.797
O.M.G. Hi, Brandon.

55:35.466 --> 55:36.665
- Pen.
- Hi, Pen.

55:38.669 --> 55:39.818
What are you guys doing here?

55:39.819 --> 55:40.968
- We? What are <i> you</i> doing here?
- You shittin' me.

55:42.006 --> 55:45.341
Oh, oh, you right,
keep I talking when I talk like this?

55:45.443 --> 55:47.810
Oh my, I do-- do-- are
you not from here?

55:47.912 --> 55:50.079
Yes, I'm from here,
but I went to school in L.A.

55:50.381 --> 55:51.780
I get better tips
when I sound local.

55:52.116 --> 55:54.650
- But that's-- That's racist!
- Get out!

55:54.752 --> 55:57.720
You can't, you like Thai
people would be insulted.

55:57.822 --> 56:00.456
Brandon, I'm Thai.

56:01.792 --> 56:04.560
I think you're confusing
racist with race-related.

56:04.995 --> 56:07.963
Hi, Dory. Looks like we're
getting our date after all.

56:08.699 --> 56:10.799
We're just
co-existing in public.

56:11.369 --> 56:14.670
Raj and Mali are here too.
Are you on a date with them too?

56:14.939 --> 56:16.772
I'm not anti a group thing.

56:17.074 --> 56:18.941
All right, you're naughty,
you're kinky.

56:19.043 --> 56:20.442
I don't hate that.

56:20.544 --> 56:22.378
You guys, you guys, I'm up next.

56:22.847 --> 56:23.946
- For me, for me.
- OK.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.013
Shut up, shut up.

56:26.884 --> 56:28.951
It's our pal, he's fun.

56:31.489 --> 56:32.421
Oh!

56:32.790 --> 56:33.722
Wow.

56:36.961 --> 56:38.127
Yeah!

56:39.163 --> 56:41.397
Fight! Fight!

56:42.066 --> 56:43.565
- Fight!
- Uh--

56:43.934 --> 56:45.601
We should probably
follow the white rabbit.

56:50.857 --> 56:52.040
Put on, put on.
I don't need that, no.

56:57.982 --> 56:58.947
Fight!

57:16.167 --> 57:17.800
Go, get up!

57:17.902 --> 57:19.468
Get up!

57:21.572 --> 57:23.205
You got him, you
got him, you got him!

57:25.609 --> 57:26.675
Fight two!

57:27.445 --> 57:29.611
- Come on man.
- Let's go!

57:31.582 --> 57:32.548
There we go!

57:42.927 --> 57:47.763
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

57:48.232 --> 57:51.500
seven, eight, nine, ten!

57:58.809 --> 58:00.175
They got one.

58:00.478 --> 58:01.710
The winner!

58:09.086 --> 58:10.052
Here buddy!

58:10.054 --> 58:13.088
Here, here you go,
yeah!

58:15.926 --> 58:16.892
Yes!

58:18.629 --> 58:20.863
I'm the best fighter
in the world!

58:43.787 --> 58:45.888
Wait, you booked
this trip over a year ago

58:45.990 --> 58:48.824
and she's been having
an affair the whole time?

58:50.961 --> 58:52.928
I guess so, wow.

58:55.933 --> 58:58.867
But I love that you were gonna
surprise her with this trip.

58:58.969 --> 59:00.235
Bet you're the plan ahead type.

59:01.972 --> 59:04.139
Um, yes, I prefer well
thought out plans.

59:05.976 --> 59:07.543
This one just didn't work.

59:07.945 --> 59:11.613
- Well, none of my plans have ever worked.
- No?

59:13.250 --> 59:16.084
My parents have run
the boat tours for... ever.

59:16.754 --> 59:18.887
And always told me I'd take
over. But I was like, no way.

59:20.024 --> 59:21.123
I wanted to act.

59:22.560 --> 59:23.725
- You did?
- Yeah.

59:25.195 --> 59:28.564
When I was 15,
I ran away to L.A.

59:29.333 --> 59:32.034
My aunt lived in Long Beach
so I moved in with her.

59:33.671 --> 59:35.337
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

59:36.307 --> 59:37.339
You know, and it was good.

59:38.075 --> 59:39.141
I got to go to school.

59:40.778 --> 59:42.711
Yeah, but there's just
so much competition,

59:42.813 --> 59:43.812
I didn't know anyone.

59:43.814 --> 59:46.748
I never really
got to act, you know.

59:46.850 --> 59:49.952
Like I came all this way
and never actually got to do it.

59:51.255 --> 59:56.158
- I'm sorry.
- When I got back, I had this whole Dorothy moment.

59:56.994 --> 59:58.927
I realized I had
everything I really wanted.

59:59.730 --> 01:00:00.796
Isn't that corny?

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:05.834
- What do you mean?
- Well, I love performing, making people happy.

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:09.004
No matter who you are
or where you're from,

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.706
I give you a great tour.

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:12.240
That's my stage.

01:00:12.343 --> 01:00:14.343
I make you laugh and have fun.

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:18.113
I teach you about our beautiful
culture and I make you respect it.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:22.250
You get to escape your normal
life and come to my world.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:26.355
Even if you fight it,
I'll get you.

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:29.291
Well, you sure got me.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:30.859
Oh, did I now?

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:36.898
Except I'll never trust you
because of all these lies.

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.951
I can't stop thinking
about your Hasselblad.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.688
Oh, yeah? I took you as
more of an Instamatic guy.

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:04.326
Well, I can point and shoot,
but that Hassie, that takes an eye.

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:06.728
Luckily I have two of them.

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:09.364
Oh, I noticed your eyes.

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:13.268
- You are just--
- So, who are you into, Annie Leibovitz?

01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:15.937
Actually I prefer Cindy Sherman.

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:18.407
Did not expect that.

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.842
So you're in it for the culture.

01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:22.144
I'm in it for the capture.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:25.313
You're a hunter?

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:29.251
Yeah, that moment, you know?

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:32.888
That moment
when something real happens.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:37.325
A smile, a feeling, nature.

01:01:38.762 --> 01:01:40.128
I see it, I catch it.

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:42.464
Make other people feel it.

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:45.834
I'm addicted to it.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.203
Me too.

01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:53.041
So you're
really a photographer?

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.877
I am. Professional.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.013
What do you shoot with?

01:01:58.015 --> 01:02:02.150
Well, my go-to is the Mamiya,
but my favorite is my Linhof.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.419
You tryin' to tell
me you shoot film.

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:07.422
Lady, I shoot 8x10.

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:17.132
You fight me.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:18.166
What?

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:19.735
You fight me.

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:21.136
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.505
We fight, I kill you.

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:26.875
N-- no, thanks.

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:31.313
So you up and moved
from California to Thailand.

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:32.748
Mm-hm.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.783
Your family didn't freak out?

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:36.384
My parents are dead.

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:40.789
- You seem okay with that.
- I didn't do it.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.092
Zipline mishap.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.762
- Stop.
- I'm serious.

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:49.898
Total freak accident on their
vacation in New Zealand.

01:02:50.367 --> 01:02:52.267
Worst freshman year ever.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.302
Except that I met Pen.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:57.239
What, you fuckin' with me?

01:02:57.341 --> 01:02:59.341
Nope, it's hilarious.

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:03.445
- Can I laugh?
- I do, all the time.

01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:09.084
And you don't get sad?

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.553
Oh, I got plenty of sad.

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:13.922
But it wasn't my fault.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:15.891
I'm not gonna carry it.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.859
And they wouldn't want me too.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:22.030
My mom killed herself.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.175
- Dan, Dan!
- B! You're not gonna believe it.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:35.310
Dory's a member
of the dead parent's club.

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:37.145
- It's true.
- What?

01:03:37.414 --> 01:03:39.247
Dory's parents are both dead.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:41.516
Dan's got no parents.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:45.420
It's so weird you're both
smiling when you say that.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.390
- He's got two parents.
- Aw.

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:50.392
I'm gonna go find Pen.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:51.359
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:52.394
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:03:54.598 --> 01:03:56.998
I mean... Buddy, what's wrong?

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:59.501
Some-- Somebody just tried
to pick a fight with me.

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:00.869
What are you talkin' about, who?

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:03.071
Just this--
this-- this Thai guy.

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:06.608
That narrows it down. Where is he, show me?

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:11.580
Oh, there, there he is.

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.349
- That guy?
- Yeah, that guy right there.

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:15.851
B, he's employed here.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.086
Yeah, they work for tips.

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:19.421
It's like wrestling.
It's like fake.

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:20.455
It's not real.

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:23.992
You don't-- you don't
know that. He was serious.

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:26.094
Yeah, serious like,
"You're a tourist

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.629
and I want you to drink
a lot and get drunk

01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:29.631
and then I'm gonna
kick your ass, yeah."

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:33.301
He wouldn't kick my ass.

01:04:34.104 --> 01:04:36.271
Buddy. We're grownups.

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:39.040
That guy's like 20 and kicks
tourist ass all day.

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:42.577
Come on, look, we need to focus
on drinking these buckets

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.913
and enjoying our last night
on the island, okay?

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:47.148
Come on, if-non, if-non.

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:50.252
Last night.

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:55.957
- Gonna borrow your buddy for a second.
- Ooh--

01:04:57.127 --> 01:04:58.493
Yeah,
what can I get ya?

01:04:59.596 --> 01:05:00.896
One bucket, please.

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:14.242
You're here to solve something.
I can tell.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.012
You can?

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.927
- Goongala.
- Goongala.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:42.270
- Who are you?
- I'm Martin.

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:47.409
Yeah, I mean,
what are you-- What are you doing here?

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:49.210
Well, this beautiful island

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:52.047
is between Myanmar
and Hong Kong and I figured,

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:53.715
be silly not to stop on the way.

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:58.420
- You came from Myanmar?
- I did.

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:00.388
And I brought half
these people with me.

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:02.023
Wanna go to Hong Kong?

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:03.658
Plenty of room in the boat.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.296
You-- You have a boat?

01:06:10.033 --> 01:06:11.433
Technically it's a yacht.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.603
Who are you?

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:20.075
Brandon, take a look
around this place.

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:25.447
All these people from different
worlds, all together.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:29.217
Every one of them
wanting the same things.

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:32.420
To feel safe.

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:36.124
To feel love.

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:39.060
To be understood.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.130
We all share that.

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:57.512
B! Ian gave us
a little surprise.

01:06:57.614 --> 01:06:59.180
- Uh-huh...
- Come on.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:12.727
Oh, I remember this.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:14.162
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:15.196
It's been a while.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:21.436
When was the last time?

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:22.236
When things started
going bad with Vanessa.

01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:25.807
We just stopped having sex.

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:32.180
It just got so awkward.

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:36.584
So you guys got high.

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:38.119
I thought it would loosen us up.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:40.288
Make her like me again.

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:43.291
But it didn't work.

01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:45.393
Fuck that, you're awesome.

01:07:50.534 --> 01:07:51.633
Except I wasn't.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:54.469
What do you mean?

01:07:55.806 --> 01:07:59.307
I wasn't awesome,
but I wanna be.

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.116
Hey.

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:11.553
I'm sorry.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:19.828
Don't mention it.

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:35.443
Hey!

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:38.513
You still want to fight?

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.814
- I kill you.
- Perfect.

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:51.126
- You don't have to do this.
- Oh, it's pro wrestling, right?

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.261
Yeah.

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:01.202
- Hey, thanks for doing this.
- Yeah.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:04.139
- Fight!
- Oh shit.

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:08.143
Go, yeah, fight!

01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:12.346
- Get out of the corner, Brandon.
- You can do it!

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:13.814
- Fight.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:14.916
Just look at that!

01:09:15.218 --> 01:09:16.317
There you go!

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:17.352
Keep moving!

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:20.321
Fight, fight!

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:22.290
All right, okay.

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:26.493
Whoa, okay, okay, okay.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.663
The main thing is, you're
just letting him hit you.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.167
Okay, you want to avoid
that as much as possible.

01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:33.935
Okay, 'cause he's
hitting you really hard

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:35.470
and there's only
so much you can take

01:09:35.572 --> 01:09:37.171
before you actually
die, all right?

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:38.773
So main takeaway?

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.274
- Don't get hit.
- Okay.

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:45.513
Hey, are we fighting,
like for real?

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:47.549
- I kill you.
- Oh shit.

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:48.683
Fight.

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:50.385
Punch!

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:57.491
