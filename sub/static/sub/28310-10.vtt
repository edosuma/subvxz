WEBVTT

00:01.309 --> 00:02.309
Eddie!

00:02.586 --> 00:03.586
Eddie!

00:04.094 --> 00:05.527
Penisi!

00:05.776 --> 00:07.055
Where are you?

00:07.460 --> 00:08.748
Eddie!

00:10.837 --> 00:11.926
Oh, no. Eddie!

00:14.894 --> 00:16.151
I found Penisi. He's down.

00:16.152 --> 00:17.686
Looks like the ceiling fell on him.

00:17.688 --> 00:19.655
<i>You rookies are a pain in my ass.</i>

00:19.657 --> 00:22.224
<i>Get him up fast, McConky.
The fire's spreading.</i>

00:22.226 --> 00:23.777
All right, come on, Eddie. Let's go.

00:26.607 --> 00:28.140
Damn, you're heavy!

00:28.165 --> 00:29.631
Aah!

00:30.813 --> 00:33.346
Boom. And there you have it, folks.

00:33.581 --> 00:35.548
That was the moment
I popped my left nut.

00:35.573 --> 00:37.750
Ew. Ouch. 22 years ago today.

00:37.775 --> 00:38.805
Do we have any audio on that?

00:38.829 --> 00:41.009
Like, d-did it actually
make a popping sound?

00:41.011 --> 00:42.368
Yeah, it sounded like this.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.177
I still hear that sound in my dreams.

00:45.201 --> 00:47.367
Oh, whatever. It doesn't
make a popping sound.

00:47.392 --> 00:48.510
That's an old wives' tale.

00:48.535 --> 00:49.918
Mm. I don't know. I
think an old wife would be

00:49.920 --> 00:52.134
the last person to know what
a popping nut sounds like.

00:52.849 --> 00:54.633
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah, well, thanks to Eddie,

00:54.658 --> 00:56.317
I was never able to have a son.

00:56.746 --> 00:59.010
Hey! What is that supposed to mean?

00:59.518 --> 01:01.140
The nut I popped was my boy nut.

01:01.265 --> 01:03.074
Wait a minute, Chief.
So you think one nut

01:03.098 --> 01:04.543
is filled with boy sperm

01:04.568 --> 01:06.284
and the other nut is
filled with girl sperm?

01:06.308 --> 01:08.837
Yeah, the nut that hangs
lower is the boy nut.

01:08.839 --> 01:11.773
That's the one I popped.
Thus, the three daughters.

01:11.775 --> 01:13.742
Chief, Chief, Chief,
Chief, Chief, Chief, Chief,

01:13.744 --> 01:17.179
a boy is made when a
sperm with a Y chromosome

01:17.181 --> 01:18.580
fertilizes the egg.

01:18.582 --> 01:21.350
A girl is made when a
sperm with an X chromosome

01:21.352 --> 01:22.851
fertilizes an egg.

01:22.853 --> 01:25.787
Exactly. My left nut had
all the Y chromosomes.

01:25.812 --> 01:28.353
"My Left Nut"... a terrific
Daniel Day-Lewis film.

01:28.746 --> 01:30.803
Hey, you guys, we only need to focus

01:30.828 --> 01:33.195
on the one ball that
matters... football.

01:33.197 --> 01:34.796
- Yeah!
- Oh!

01:34.798 --> 01:37.866
And we need to celebrate our
team going to the big game!

01:37.868 --> 01:40.269
- Go Seattle!
- Sports!

01:40.593 --> 01:42.164
Yeah, Super Bowl!

01:42.307 --> 01:43.801
Sports AF!

<i>And today is the day.</i>

02:08.899 --> 02:10.632
<i>We're an hour away from kickoff,</i>

02:10.633 --> 02:13.502
<i>and you can only wonder what
is going through the minds...</i>

02:13.504 --> 02:14.607
Why are you even trying to record it?

02:14.631 --> 02:15.882
You know we're gonna
watch it live, right?

02:15.906 --> 02:17.343
I'm so sick of getting called out

02:17.368 --> 02:18.640
and missing half the game, all right?

02:18.642 --> 02:21.142
Super Bowl Sunday is the biggest
paramedic day of the year...

02:21.322 --> 02:23.613
people having heart
attacks, choking on wings.

02:23.802 --> 02:25.324
Dude, just for once... for once...

02:25.349 --> 02:28.156
especially with Seattle playing,
I want to see the whole game.

02:28.255 --> 02:30.396
But how are we gonna avoid
knowing what the score is

02:30.421 --> 02:31.882
when we're out in public?

02:31.923 --> 02:33.265
Somebody tells me the score,

02:33.290 --> 02:35.190
I'ma zap them with my defib paddles.

02:35.192 --> 02:36.625
Have you ever done it before?

02:36.627 --> 02:38.470
Yeah, I murdered like
three people doing that.

02:38.989 --> 02:40.949
All right, listen up 
here, guys. Listen up.

02:41.543 --> 02:42.809
Just in case any of you were thinking

02:42.833 --> 02:45.133
about snorting crank for
the big shindig today,

02:45.135 --> 02:47.869
I just got word... we're
getting drug tested on Tuesday.

02:47.871 --> 02:49.734
Hey, Chief, do steroids count?

02:49.868 --> 02:52.736
Just asking for a
friend named Ike Crystal.

02:52.761 --> 02:54.320
"Oh, does, uh, propecia count?

02:54.345 --> 02:55.987
Just asking for an idiot."

02:56.053 --> 02:57.442
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

02:57.467 --> 03:00.389
Okay. Regardless, I know
weed is legal out there,

03:00.561 --> 03:02.708
but under my roof, punishable by death.

03:02.733 --> 03:04.411
Didn't we used to call
you Cheech McConky?

03:05.211 --> 03:07.213
Ha. Funny. I never touched the stuff.

03:07.302 --> 03:09.859
I wouldn't want to mess with
my lightning-fast reaction time.

03:09.893 --> 03:10.908
Oh! Think fast.

03:11.428 --> 03:12.428
Oh!

03:12.763 --> 03:14.496
I'm so sorry, Chief. I'm so sorry.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.398
- Ike, damn it!
- I'm so sorry! I know!

03:16.400 --> 03:17.833
- No ball in here.
- I know, but I thought...

03:17.835 --> 03:18.860
I thought you were ready.

03:18.885 --> 03:20.513
- You can't do that to the chief.
- No, I know.

03:20.537 --> 03:22.004
I thought you had quick reflexes.

03:22.029 --> 03:23.061
Ike, go sit in the corner.

03:23.085 --> 03:24.417
- Sit in the corner!
- No, I'm so sorry.

03:24.441 --> 03:26.402
Andy, I am so screwed.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.055
I went to a party on Friday
night, and I ate a brownie.

03:29.516 --> 03:31.357
Turns out it had weed in it.

03:32.082 --> 03:33.115
You had no idea?

03:33.117 --> 03:34.258
None.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.316
Ahh!

03:38.776 --> 03:39.965
Ooh!

03:39.990 --> 03:41.271
Man, that's smooth.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.242
Hey, is there a lot of
pot in those brownies?

03:43.642 --> 03:46.138
Tons. I can't move my arms.

03:46.163 --> 03:48.342
Snap! Then I better just have two.

03:49.194 --> 03:50.593
Mmm!

03:52.436 --> 03:54.016
Did you freak when you found out?

03:54.119 --> 03:55.843
Uh, yeah, I was super-upset.

03:56.273 --> 03:58.874
And then they carried
me out of the strip club.

04:01.612 --> 04:04.110
My dad and my uncle were there.

04:04.748 --> 04:08.316
If I test positive on this,
my dad is going to kill me.

04:08.318 --> 04:10.788
Yeah. He's gonna go berserk.

04:11.432 --> 04:13.322
Ooh, I might need to get high for that.

04:14.176 --> 04:16.192
Chief, that was a bad one,
okay? You weren't ready.

04:16.226 --> 04:17.269
- That was totally my fault.
- Okay.

04:17.274 --> 04:19.163
- Go long. Ready?
- Don't, I just. No, don't...

04:19.188 --> 04:21.140
- Oh!
- I'm so sorry!

04:21.165 --> 04:22.397
- I thought you were ready!
- Listen.

04:22.399 --> 04:24.166
- You were looking right at me.
- No game for you.

04:24.168 --> 04:25.701
- No party for you.
- No, Chief!

04:25.703 --> 04:26.735
No party!

04:29.059 --> 04:31.184
Yeah, so, if you could be
the most amazing little sister

04:31.208 --> 04:33.642
in the world and pee in a
cup and not tell Mom and Dad,

04:33.644 --> 04:35.461
I'll do your geometry
homework for a month.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.627
You did what last weekend? Ugh!

04:39.652 --> 04:41.261
Dude, put your little
sister on the phone.

04:41.285 --> 04:43.385
- Are you sucking on pennies?
- Maybe.

04:43.387 --> 04:44.681
You look like a slot machine.

04:45.199 --> 04:47.833
You know, sucking on pennies is
just to beat the breathalyzer.

04:47.858 --> 04:49.758
Yeah, I know, but I got
to cover all my bases.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.273
I cannot fail this test.

04:51.395 --> 04:52.695
You're so screwed.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.025
Maybe you can look online
to find different ways

04:55.050 --> 04:56.252
to beat a drug test.

04:56.627 --> 04:59.470
You know, cranberry juice is for
a UTI, so that's not gonna work.

04:59.495 --> 05:00.567
Yeah, I know.

05:01.748 --> 05:02.748
Oh...

05:02.773 --> 05:04.482
Game time, come on!

05:04.875 --> 05:06.293
- Ugh.
- Don't judge me.

05:06.454 --> 05:08.722
- Yeah, come on, Seattle. Let's go.
- Yeah, baby.

05:08.747 --> 05:09.867
Hey, guys, the rain stopped.

05:10.034 --> 05:11.192
Bring on the fires, right?

05:11.782 --> 05:13.982
- Why would you say that?
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

05:13.984 --> 05:14.996
All right.

05:15.021 --> 05:16.929
<i>Kicks! He's lightening fast!</i>

05:16.954 --> 05:19.494
- Yeah! That's a good sign.
- I like it.

05:19.803 --> 05:21.890
Hey, Eddie, since this
is the 22nd anniversary

05:21.892 --> 05:24.791
of me rescuing you, why don't
you go fix me a plate of food?

05:24.882 --> 05:26.260
Oh, yeah, I got your plate right here.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.293
You should be happy to do it.

05:27.317 --> 05:29.041
You're living on borrowed
time thanks to me.

05:29.066 --> 05:31.299
- Really?
- Every cooking contest you lose,

05:31.301 --> 05:33.164
every time you get your asshole waxed,

05:33.222 --> 05:35.522
every police captain's
wife you have sex with...

05:35.572 --> 05:37.506
- They were separated...
- every 73-year-old woman's hip

05:37.508 --> 05:39.307
you break doing missionary bufu...

05:39.309 --> 05:40.709
She said she was dying.

05:40.711 --> 05:42.410
... every time you say,
"I'm Eddie Penisi"...

05:42.412 --> 05:43.779
Well, I am Eddie Penisi.

05:43.781 --> 05:45.614
- ... all thanks to me.
- Hey, guys.

05:45.616 --> 05:47.482
Can you respectfully stop bickering

05:47.484 --> 05:48.750
until the game is over?

05:48.752 --> 05:50.577
Yeah, I can stop bickering
if this guy shuts up.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.831
- Okay.
- <i>And here we go!</i>

05:52.856 --> 05:54.956
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

05:54.958 --> 05:57.325
<i>Simmons gets it at the Seattle
2, and here he comes!</i>

05:57.327 --> 05:59.152
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Oh, nice!

05:59.177 --> 06:02.307
<i>He's at the 20, the 30,
and all the way past midfield!</i>

06:05.536 --> 06:07.335
<i>Station 24, all units, structure fire.</i>

06:07.337 --> 06:09.004
- <i>Repeat... structure fire.</i>
- No!

06:09.006 --> 06:11.973
Why would a fire start
when the rain stops?!

06:16.446 --> 06:19.014
Hey, Granny, don't worry. We
can watch the game on my phone.

06:19.016 --> 06:20.392
No, man!

06:20.417 --> 06:22.461
Listen, we're DVRing the game, okay?

06:22.486 --> 06:24.419
No one watches, no updates, nothing.

06:24.421 --> 06:26.850
And I'm turning off all devices
so we don't find out the score.

06:26.874 --> 06:27.953
I second that one.

06:27.978 --> 06:29.102
I'm surprised you're even coming, Chief.

06:29.126 --> 06:31.006
Shouldn't you be staying
behind to do inventory?

06:31.115 --> 06:32.739
Maybe you can count how
many testicles you got left.

06:32.763 --> 06:34.090
- Oh!
- Oh!

06:34.115 --> 06:35.133
Yeah, I figured I'd come along

06:35.157 --> 06:36.442
in case you needed
someone to save your life.

06:36.466 --> 06:38.266
- Whoa!
- Whoa-ho-ho!

06:38.628 --> 06:39.634
Good one, Chief.

06:53.259 --> 06:54.449
Car one on the scene.

06:54.451 --> 06:56.084
We have a two-story
commercial structure.

06:56.086 --> 06:57.321
There's a working fire.

06:57.449 --> 06:58.616
Car one in command.

07:01.491 --> 07:02.770
Is that what I think it is?

07:04.026 --> 07:06.019
It is if you think
it's a weed dispensary.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.179
I'm getting hungry just looking at it.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.364
What do we got?

07:11.389 --> 07:12.802
Let's use the attack line
off the rear step.

07:12.826 --> 07:14.185
- Andy.
- Got it, Cap.

07:14.305 --> 07:15.905
And try not to lose
consciousness in there, Cap.

07:15.929 --> 07:17.529
Oh, okay, have fun
doing nothing outside.

07:17.531 --> 07:18.864
Try to make some friends.

07:18.866 --> 07:20.866
I forget what snippy,
little bitches they turn into

07:20.868 --> 07:22.300
on their pop-nutaversary.

07:22.302 --> 07:24.440
Hey, Lucy, you make the
hydrant. You're pumping this job.

07:24.464 --> 07:26.116
All right, boys, let's
go to work. Let's go.

07:27.764 --> 07:29.953
Hey, Andy, they have
this urine detox product

07:29.978 --> 07:31.143
in these dispensaries.

07:31.145 --> 07:33.745
It's called Urine Da Money.
Will you grab me some?

07:33.747 --> 07:36.071
Yeah, I'll put it on the top
of my list when I get in there.

07:36.095 --> 07:37.128
Wait, really?

07:37.484 --> 07:38.511
Go!

07:43.824 --> 07:45.524
<i>And Pittsburgh has answered back</i>

07:45.526 --> 07:47.492
<i>beautifully to Seattle's
opening touchdown.</i>

07:47.494 --> 07:49.895
<i>And that's the end of the first
quarter... score Seattle!</i>

07:49.897 --> 07:52.865
- Whoa!
- What the hell are you doing?

07:52.890 --> 07:55.934
The TV, it was gonna explode
from the, uh, the heat.

07:55.936 --> 07:58.003
- Come on, man.
- Come on, let's keep going.

07:58.005 --> 08:00.505
Keep going. Nobody smashes any more TVs.

08:00.507 --> 08:01.525
Come on.

08:05.946 --> 08:08.013
Ike, you and Granny take that back room.

08:08.015 --> 08:10.115
Andy, go with them.
I'll take the nozzle.

08:12.607 --> 08:13.795
Here we go.

08:18.258 --> 08:19.925
♪ Get lit, get lit ♪

08:19.927 --> 08:22.394
Do you think magicians' doves are happy?

08:26.443 --> 08:27.999
I wish I had a horse.

08:32.905 --> 08:35.207
Hey, it's Voltron.

08:36.477 --> 08:38.953
No, we're not Voltron,
pal. We're firefighters.

08:38.979 --> 08:40.001
We're here to get you out.

08:40.025 --> 08:41.066
- Come on, let's go.
- What?

08:41.090 --> 08:45.694
No, man, we're good. This
is, like, a dope AF hotbox.

08:45.719 --> 08:47.291
Well, it's about to
get really hot in here

08:47.315 --> 08:49.187
when this is on fire, so let's go.

08:49.189 --> 08:51.957
But how do I know you guys
are who you say you are?

08:51.959 --> 08:54.043
I just said it! We're firefighters!

08:54.068 --> 08:56.592
But how do I know the
building is actually on fire?

08:56.617 --> 08:58.197
Do you hear that smoke alarm?

08:58.222 --> 08:59.969
- What's it sound like?
- Are you kidding me?

08:59.993 --> 09:01.368
Listen! It's going right now!

09:04.395 --> 09:06.134
I'm not getting it. Are you getting it?

09:06.159 --> 09:07.172
Give me another one. You do it.

09:07.174 --> 09:08.707
Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.509
- No.
- Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh.

09:10.511 --> 09:11.820
That's it. Maybe all three of you.

09:11.845 --> 09:13.278
All three of you.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.846
- Do you not hear that?
- You can't hear that?

09:14.848 --> 09:16.615
Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh.

09:16.617 --> 09:19.017
- That's EDM! That's some good EDM!
- All right. Come with me.

09:19.019 --> 09:22.044
Let's go. Get up. Get
your ass off the couch.

09:22.069 --> 09:23.404
Myawani, you okay?

09:24.468 --> 09:25.993
My mask malfunctioned.

09:27.261 --> 09:29.571
- Here, pal, use mine.
- You know what?

09:30.091 --> 09:32.449
Huh. I can... I can
breathe okay out here.

09:33.299 --> 09:34.566
Yeah. I'm good.

09:34.568 --> 09:36.168
- I'm good.
- Granny?

09:37.257 --> 09:38.263
No...

09:38.288 --> 09:39.337
Here, use mine.

09:39.339 --> 09:40.505
- Is yours okay?
- No, no. I'm good.

09:40.507 --> 09:41.740
- You want to use mine?
- No, no, I'm good.

09:41.742 --> 09:43.141
- Thank you, Granny, but I'm good.
- You sure?

09:43.143 --> 09:45.544
- I think we're okay, fellas.
- Yeah. Sure.

09:46.869 --> 09:49.203
Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh.

09:49.316 --> 09:53.532
Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh.

09:53.557 --> 09:56.124
- Yo!
- Super-bright.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.872
Ah, the building really is on fire.

09:59.372 --> 10:01.837
See, I thought it was a drill.
You should've said something.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.662
That's literally all I
said was the building...

10:03.664 --> 10:05.463
we're trying to get you
out, the building's on fire.

10:05.465 --> 10:07.732
Oh, man, we got the
rest of the people out.

10:07.734 --> 10:09.000
Hey, what happened to your masks?

10:09.002 --> 10:11.304
- What's that?
- What happened to your masks?

10:11.835 --> 10:17.087
Oh, uh, Andy lost his, and then,
uh, I-I-I borrowed him mine.

10:17.438 --> 10:18.955
Then, of course, I didn't have one.

10:19.844 --> 10:21.056
And then Granny...

10:23.187 --> 10:24.282
Granny...

10:26.879 --> 10:27.934
Because Granny...

10:30.298 --> 10:32.198
Are you guys stoned right now?

10:33.487 --> 10:34.520
No.

10:36.893 --> 10:38.689
I'm high as a bat.

10:38.856 --> 10:41.099
I'm gonna fail the shit out
of that drug test, though.

10:41.101 --> 10:43.194
<i>Myawani, I need you back in here.</i>

10:43.530 --> 10:44.553
Copy, Cap.

10:44.578 --> 10:45.958
- Yeah.
- Let me get that mask.

10:45.983 --> 10:48.061
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

10:49.076 --> 10:50.442
This is my chance.

10:50.444 --> 10:52.210
Hey, Lucy, where the hell are you going?

10:52.212 --> 10:53.378
Uh, uh, fire's almost out.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.213
I'm gonna go check
the heat levels inside.

10:55.215 --> 10:57.449
No, there's smoke in there. You
can't go in there without a mask.

10:57.451 --> 10:58.793
I'll get my mask.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.039
You know you're supposed to
be on the truck. Let's go.

11:01.184 --> 11:02.354
Copy that, Chief.

11:03.701 --> 11:05.133
<i>And Seattle scores!</i>

11:05.158 --> 11:07.225
Seattle just ran an interception
back for a touchdown!

11:07.227 --> 11:08.960
- Yeah!
- Yes!

11:08.962 --> 11:10.228
14-7, Seattle.

11:10.230 --> 11:13.106
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Listen
to me, citizens, okay?

11:13.131 --> 11:14.466
I'm gonna need all of your cellphones

11:14.468 --> 11:15.903
inside of this bag, all right?

11:15.928 --> 11:18.570
All your cellphones,
tablets, any other devices.

11:18.572 --> 11:20.305
It's an order from
the fire commissioner.

11:20.307 --> 11:22.574
Come on. Mobile devices
have been exploding

11:22.576 --> 11:24.643
spontaneously around burning buildings.

11:24.645 --> 11:26.878
It's a scientific fact. Look it up.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.974
Well, you can't 'cause I
got your phones now, so...

11:29.383 --> 11:33.614
You'll get them back once we've
contained all of this, okay?

11:40.827 --> 11:42.661
Oh, my God! My baby!

11:42.663 --> 11:43.862
Ma'am, step away from that building.

11:43.864 --> 11:46.097
My baby! My baby's inside!

11:46.683 --> 11:47.712
I'll go. I'll go.

11:48.544 --> 11:50.844
You have to save my baby!

11:57.361 --> 12:00.079
Come back. Andy, hold it
steady. Get back there.

12:00.814 --> 12:02.358
Man, this fire's growing.

12:11.807 --> 12:13.950
Huh? "My Baby?"

12:13.975 --> 12:15.760
Oh, come on.

12:15.762 --> 12:18.496
You got to be kidding
me. Stupid stoners.

12:19.020 --> 12:21.276
Aah! Aah!

12:24.807 --> 12:27.635
Hey, Cap, have you ever had
European chocolate before?

12:28.095 --> 12:30.096
Uh, probably. Why?

12:30.243 --> 12:32.742
I find it more perfumy
than the American stuff.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.580
- Would you agree with me?
- What the hell are you talking about?

12:35.582 --> 12:37.615
I don't know, man. I'm stoned.

12:39.286 --> 12:41.371
- Hey, whoa, whoa.
- What?

12:41.396 --> 12:42.919
- Hey, what's going on?
- Wh... What happened?

12:42.943 --> 12:44.222
What happened to the water?

12:44.224 --> 12:46.224
<i>Lucy, where's the water?</i>

12:46.226 --> 12:47.992
I don't know. We lost pressure.

12:47.994 --> 12:49.427
I should probably come inside.

12:49.429 --> 12:51.706
<i>No, just find out what
happened to the water.</i>

12:51.849 --> 12:53.828
Oh, going through the
halftime flush, huh?

12:53.967 --> 12:56.220
- The... The what?
- You know, the halftime flush.

12:56.370 --> 12:59.699
Halftime on Super Sunday is the
single biggest flush of the year.

12:59.826 --> 13:01.606
Water pressure drops
all around the city.

13:01.608 --> 13:03.805
Man, it's, like, scientific.

13:04.395 --> 13:06.555
Captain, it's the halftime flush.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.314
All right, we're coming out. This
fire's already flaring back up.

13:27.001 --> 13:29.661
I remember you said you had a
juice box. You still have them?

13:29.686 --> 13:31.520
Lucy, where's the water pressure?

13:31.662 --> 13:32.710
I don't know.

13:33.097 --> 13:34.597
Ooh. It's not on yet.

13:34.622 --> 13:36.323
Hey, halftime's still going.

13:36.348 --> 13:39.280
- Andy!
- Rainbow Juice just hit the stage.

13:39.690 --> 13:41.523
Rainbow Juice? What the
hell's Rainbow Juice?

13:41.548 --> 13:43.047
You don't know who Rainbow Juice is?

13:43.072 --> 13:45.595
They're, like, the hottest
girl band out of Tasmania.

13:45.801 --> 13:47.828
Come on. They even sing that song.

13:47.853 --> 13:50.387
♪ Oh, we're not all animals ♪

13:50.412 --> 13:52.979
♪ We're not all animals ♪

13:53.004 --> 13:55.203
Ooh, look! Steven Tyler
just hit the stage.

13:55.228 --> 13:57.995
This is gonna really happen.

13:58.020 --> 13:59.032
I love her.

14:00.217 --> 14:01.789
Chief, the water pressure's still down,

14:01.814 --> 14:03.165
and the tank's empty.
What do you want to do?

14:03.189 --> 14:04.393
Oh, Granny, Granny...

14:04.444 --> 14:05.615
<i>Chief, you there?</i>

14:06.401 --> 14:07.419
Chief?

14:07.444 --> 14:09.665
Is the chief a bigger fellow?

14:09.690 --> 14:11.450
Looks like a pumpkin on popsicle sticks?

14:11.545 --> 14:13.078
Yes, that's exactly right.

14:13.136 --> 14:14.454
He ran into the building.

14:15.775 --> 14:17.059
Terry, you there?

14:19.483 --> 14:20.713
Andy, we're going back.

14:20.916 --> 14:21.951
To the station?

14:21.976 --> 14:25.218
Oh, I think it's irresponsible
for us to leave now.

14:25.243 --> 14:27.209
- Just come with me.
- Okay.

14:29.103 --> 14:30.645
Chief! Chief!

14:30.771 --> 14:31.835
Terry!

14:33.510 --> 14:34.584
There he is.

14:37.132 --> 14:39.687
All right, on three. One, two, three.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.894
Make a clear path outside
and get the paramedics ready.

14:48.919 --> 14:50.332
- I'll bring him out.
- Copy, Cap.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.861
Damn, you are heavy.

14:54.886 --> 14:56.394
Aah!

14:56.871 --> 14:58.594
Oh, my nut!

14:59.427 --> 15:02.436
Ooh! It really does
make a popping sound.

15:02.897 --> 15:04.016
Huh? Huh?

15:04.041 --> 15:06.066
I hope you're happy,
you top-heavy A-hole.

15:06.193 --> 15:07.661
Eddie, save yourself.

15:08.353 --> 15:10.320
I'm so high.

15:10.345 --> 15:13.746
I'm too high to survive.
I'm very, very high.

15:13.771 --> 15:15.430
Don't be stupid. I got you.

15:16.135 --> 15:18.502
I love you, Eddie,
like a little brother.

15:18.527 --> 15:20.115
Like a tiny brother, Eddie.

15:20.140 --> 15:21.505
Jesus Christ, it's awkward enough

15:21.530 --> 15:23.016
without you saying my name twice.

15:23.041 --> 15:26.409
I never told you this, but I'm
really jealous of your mustache.

15:26.434 --> 15:29.007
It's a really good mustache... strong.

15:29.032 --> 15:30.692
Well, it goes without
saying, my mustache

15:30.717 --> 15:33.685
is awesome and yours sucks,
but what are you gonna do?

15:33.710 --> 15:36.062
You've only got like 12 hair
holes on your entire face.

15:37.273 --> 15:38.985
It's so nice of you to say that.

15:39.293 --> 15:40.989
You've got a good heart, you know that?

15:41.419 --> 15:43.603
- I love how you love cats.
- You know what?

15:43.628 --> 15:45.357
- You're almost too good of a man.
- Yep.

15:45.382 --> 15:47.122
That'll be the name
of my autobiography...

15:47.147 --> 15:48.696
"Eddie Penisi... Too Good of a Man."

15:48.721 --> 15:49.942
Oh, you know what, though?

15:50.149 --> 15:51.882
Of all the things that are fat on you,

15:51.907 --> 15:54.201
- I think your face is the fattest.
- Terry,

15:54.712 --> 15:57.674
all I know is I'm
about to save your life

15:57.957 --> 16:00.224
and get a gigantic monkey off my back.

16:00.249 --> 16:01.272
I'm the monkey.

16:01.297 --> 16:04.441
Consider us even, you nutless mother...

16:04.466 --> 16:05.999
Aah!

16:09.501 --> 16:10.501
<i>Cap?</i>

16:10.798 --> 16:12.227
<i>Cap, you all right in there?</i>

16:22.784 --> 16:24.861
- Oh!
- Chief! Chief!

16:25.985 --> 16:27.705
Oh, man!

16:28.031 --> 16:29.689
Holy shit.

16:29.859 --> 16:31.310
I saved your life, my dude.

16:31.335 --> 16:33.645
What? No. I saved you. We are even.

16:33.939 --> 16:37.373
No, maybe not. I carried you
out of a burning building.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.907
I saved your life twice, and
they all took pictures of it!

16:43.439 --> 16:45.348
- Whoo-hoo! Whoo!
- No, no, no.

16:45.373 --> 16:47.742
I found you unconscious
inside that building,

16:47.767 --> 16:49.799
and I carried you all
the way to the front door.

16:49.824 --> 16:51.127
- I have a witness.
- That's bullshit.

16:51.151 --> 16:52.250
- Andy.
- What's up, Cap?

16:52.275 --> 16:54.208
We found Chief unconscious inside,

16:54.233 --> 16:56.343
- and I carried him out, right?
- When? Just now?

16:56.368 --> 16:57.677
I don't remember anything.

16:58.389 --> 17:01.429
Eat it, Penisi. I saved your life twice,

17:01.454 --> 17:02.629
and there's nothing you can do about it.

17:02.653 --> 17:03.865
No, no, no, no.

17:03.890 --> 17:04.978
I popped a nut.

17:05.002 --> 17:07.233
Oh, you wish you popped a nut.

17:07.258 --> 17:10.441
Goddamn it, I could go for
some bread pudding right now.

17:10.921 --> 17:12.551
Anybody else in the
mood for bread pudding?

17:12.576 --> 17:14.242
I do! Raise my hand!

17:14.267 --> 17:17.199
No, but I would punch
a cat in the asshole

17:17.223 --> 17:18.288
for some Taco Bell.

17:19.037 --> 17:21.251
Oh, you think they make
bread pudding at Taco Bell?

17:21.790 --> 17:25.018
If they did, it would be
called pudito breadito.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.471
Pudito breadito! I'd
eat the shit out of that.

17:40.615 --> 17:43.883
Okay, you know what? I am officially
stoned, and I think I like it.

17:43.908 --> 17:45.553
Well, good. I like you stoned, too.

17:45.803 --> 17:46.914
All right, but who's
gonna drive the engine?

17:46.938 --> 17:47.938
Lucy can do it.

17:47.963 --> 17:49.563
She never went inside,
so she's not high.

17:50.137 --> 17:53.566
No can do, El Capitan.
Sorry. Can't do it.

17:53.591 --> 17:55.457
You see that smoke
billowing out of there?

17:55.482 --> 17:56.710
Ugh, secondhand smoke.

17:56.735 --> 17:58.490
I just got caught the gnarliest buzz,

17:58.515 --> 18:01.096
and I'm just faded AF.

18:02.113 --> 18:03.137
It's all so baffling.

18:03.162 --> 18:04.210
I don't know.

18:04.456 --> 18:06.089
- Really?
- Really.

18:06.114 --> 18:07.173
Maybe I can drive.

18:07.673 --> 18:09.707
- Shut up.
- Ike, you okay to drive?

18:10.103 --> 18:11.145
Not a chance.

18:13.595 --> 18:15.195
Why are we laughing?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.872
Think about this one.

18:17.573 --> 18:20.003
Every single person at one time

18:20.028 --> 18:22.410
was the youngest person on Earth.

18:23.823 --> 18:24.835
Whoa.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.407
Right? Right?

18:27.432 --> 18:29.511
Yo, that just blew my mind, man.

18:29.536 --> 18:30.868
- That's deep.
- I know. I know.

18:30.893 --> 18:31.957
Hey, you know what's great?

18:31.981 --> 18:33.839
I still don't know anything
about the game.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.813
Ah, that's good!

18:35.815 --> 18:38.173
Man, best game in history.

18:38.198 --> 18:39.318
Hey, man, you don't have to talk

18:39.342 --> 18:41.150
- about it.
- Why not? It was epic, dude.

18:41.175 --> 18:42.929
Well, I'm DVRing it right now, so...

18:42.954 --> 18:45.355
I hate guys like you.
I'm sorry, but I do.

18:45.380 --> 18:48.047
You DVR the game, and then
no one can talk about it.

18:48.072 --> 18:50.405
And everybody knows, and the
whole city's going bananas.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.103
- Whoa, whoa.
- "Oh, I DVR'd the game.

18:52.128 --> 18:54.057
Nobody say anything." Well, guess what?

18:54.082 --> 18:55.734
- The final score...
- No, no, no. Stop! Stop!

18:55.758 --> 18:58.377
- ... was Seattle, 49 to 48.
- Please, I beg you! No, no, no!

18:58.402 --> 19:00.402
Yeah, that's right. Seattle won.

19:00.427 --> 19:02.594
It all turned around
in the fourth quarter

19:02.619 --> 19:04.819
- after they were down by 5...
- What are you doing?

19:04.844 --> 19:06.336
- No, no. What are you doing?
- Clear, bitch!

19:06.360 --> 19:09.138
- Hang on!
- Aah!

19:09.559 --> 19:11.035
Holy shit!

19:14.544 --> 19:16.270
That's the best part
about being a paramedic.

19:16.294 --> 19:18.270
- You can do shit like that.
- Okay.

19:25.315 --> 19:26.642
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

19:36.515 --> 19:40.027
Goddamn. A $500 Miller at a
two-Michelin-star restaurant

19:40.305 --> 19:42.097
ain't got nothing on this pudding, man.

19:42.122 --> 19:44.925
I don't know what a Michelin
restaurant is, but it is good.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.384
Yeah! Stoned AF!

19:47.386 --> 19:50.487
Hey, remember when that
stoned kid called 911

19:50.489 --> 19:53.163
because Dimpus Burger was
out of the Nifty meals?

19:54.760 --> 19:58.595
That kid... That kid painted
That kid painted his dog blue

19:58.597 --> 20:02.099
and made it look for clues
for the missing Nifty meals.

20:07.983 --> 20:10.996
Was that the same kid?!
That was the same kid!

20:12.661 --> 20:14.421
- Oh, man!
- Oh, man!

20:14.446 --> 20:15.979
High AF in here.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.762
What? I can feel you looking at me.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.957
Oh, you are not fooling me, young lady.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.789
You are not stoned.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.755
What? I'm so stoned right now.

20:28.780 --> 20:30.427
Oh, please. You think I don't know

20:30.429 --> 20:32.505
what a person not on drugs looks like?

20:33.279 --> 20:35.411
Fine, but please don't
tell Dad I'm not high.

20:36.451 --> 20:37.726
All right, just this once.

20:38.306 --> 20:40.003
But don't let it happen again.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.705
Oh, thank you, Mom. You're the best.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.523
Cap, how's the popped nut?

20:44.548 --> 20:47.077
Oh, the popped nut is delicious.
I highly recommend it.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.972
Regarding its companion,
the still active nut,

20:52.536 --> 20:54.151
I must say, it is strange to know

20:54.153 --> 20:56.453
that I'll only be operating
on one nut from now on.

20:56.455 --> 20:59.422
But I did save Chief's
life, making us even.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.724
No, please.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.160
If you ever decide to
have kids and we find out

21:03.162 --> 21:05.742
it's your girl nut that
survived, then we'll be even.

21:05.767 --> 21:07.230
Wait, whoa, whoa. What does that mean?

21:07.232 --> 21:08.389
Y'all ready for this?

21:08.471 --> 21:11.222
It means I hope his
popped nut is the one

21:11.247 --> 21:13.757
that holds all the Y chromosomes
so he only has daughters.

21:13.782 --> 21:16.800
Uh, honey, sweetheart,
it doesn't work that way.

21:16.825 --> 21:19.295
Yes, it does. You're a
nurse. You should know that.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.260
What, so you think, uh,
one testicle has the Y sperm

21:22.285 --> 21:24.198
and the other testicle has the X sperm?

21:24.223 --> 21:26.106
- Uh, yeah.
- It does.

21:27.313 --> 21:29.263
He's a... idiot.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.517
Both of you guys are idiots.
What other explanation is there

21:33.542 --> 21:35.077
for why I only have daughters?

21:35.794 --> 21:37.594
Actually, you know, uh, boys are made

21:37.596 --> 21:40.163
when the wife has an
orgasm during conception.

21:40.165 --> 21:43.166
And, uh, girls are made when they don't.

21:43.168 --> 21:44.701
Oh!

21:56.934 --> 22:01.272
Hey, you guys, I am
having the time of my life.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.653
Nothing can bring me down.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.369
Eddie Penisi.

22:08.137 --> 22:09.747
Lola, what are you doing here?

22:09.995 --> 22:11.408
I'm pregnant.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.976
I'm glad I'm not Eddie Penisi.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.062
Oop! Time to go.

22:21.812 --> 22:23.095
All right, Cap.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.009
Ma'am.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.308
Whoo!

22:27.990 --> 22:31.191
Now, let's talk about buying a house.

22:31.216 --> 22:35.237
Oh, God, I am having a panic attack.

22:35.262 --> 22:37.064
Does anyone remember
where their rooms are?

22:37.089 --> 22:38.755
- Yeah.
- Oh, I know where Andy's is.

22:38.757 --> 22:40.853
- I do.
- I thought you were stoned.

22:40.878 --> 22:42.726
I am. I'm totally stoned.

22:42.728 --> 22:44.361
I'm room 420.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.304
Oh! Party in the probie's room!

22:47.552 --> 22:48.601
Party AF!

22:48.626 --> 22:49.658
No, Dad.

22:51.928 --> 22:53.270
Wow. Do you guys know how...

22:55.510 --> 22:56.535
You okay?

22:56.560 --> 22:58.903
Just don't go "meh" before you do it.

22:59.857 --> 23:02.489
Guys, I'll be on the roof
keeping lookout, okay?

23:02.514 --> 23:04.714
If anything happens,
okay, I'm gonna call down.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.554
I'll say, "Meh, what's going on?!" Okay?

23:09.367 --> 23:11.321
That's good, 'cause I don't
like getting my dick tapped.

23:11.323 --> 23:12.922
Good, then I won't tap that dick

23:12.924 --> 23:14.791
'cause I wouldn't know where
to find it in the first place.

23:14.793 --> 23:17.027
Oh, you should check your mom's
ass, 'cause that's where it is.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.762
You son of a... bitch.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.630
All right, all right, all right.

23:20.632 --> 23:23.600
No updates, no nothing. And we...

23:23.602 --> 23:25.068
Why am I taking my pants off?

23:25.070 --> 23:26.503
All right. Stay there, stay there.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.738
Well, a drinking danger is... Sorry.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.776
Good, 'cause I don't like
getting my dick tapped.

23:32.778 --> 23:35.514
I wouldn't know how to tap
it. It's so hard to find.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.524
Oh, yeah? You'll find
it in your mom's ass.

23:37.795 --> 23:41.528
Something that small can't
go in that tight hole.

23:43.655 --> 23:45.055
You're not gonna scare me, okay?

23:45.057 --> 23:48.067
I'm a man grown, I'm not
some little bouncing baby boy

23:48.092 --> 23:49.225
- you can scare...
- Whoa!

23:49.227 --> 23:51.127
Oh! Ah, shit!

23:51.357 --> 23:52.372
You okay?

23:52.397 --> 23:53.541
Thanks. Why don't...

23:53.742 --> 23:55.607
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Thanks.

23:55.632 --> 23:59.744
Canyon Breeze... weighing in
or weighing out with the gr...

24:06.647 --> 24:08.944
Somehow, she got word
that you guys are trying

24:08.969 --> 24:11.348
to get some nudity into
this new concept of yours.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.211
She has called off...

24:14.856 --> 24:15.856
But, Chief...

24:16.223 --> 24:17.331
There it is again.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.417
But, Chief, she's a girl.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.196
Come here. Come here. Bring it in.
