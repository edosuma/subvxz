00:02.201 --> 00:03.701
 This is just the beginning. 

00:03.702 --> 00:05.702
 came krees claim the system. 

00:06.103 --> 00:08.703
krees want to create a wormhole stable, 

00:08.704 --> 00:10.904
 to spend their fleets
through this area. 

00:11.305 --> 00:13.805
- The Sun?
- Will be split in half.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.606
 - Pantera, what happened?
- Warning... 

00:15.607 --> 00:17.907
 You are on a collision course with the Sun

00:18.308 --> 00:19.908
If we do not close that gate...

00:19.909 --> 00:21.209
Is the end for everyone!

00:21.210 --> 00:23.810
Come on in and
destroy from the inside out, then.

00:23.811 --> 00:26.311
- We are alive?
- Not for long.

00:34.312 --> 00:36.812
I have multiple contacts in 2-9-2!

00:36.813 --> 00:38.613
They are coming!

Shells fell!

00:48.915 --> 00:50.615
We will not stand

Enable subspace engines!

00:52.217 --> 00:53.517
're Offline!

00:53.818 --> 00:56.318
Our only hope is to land on the planet!

01:00.919 --> 01:03.619
Not gonna make it!
We're not going to get!

01:03.620 --> 01:05.620
Stop talking like that!
You can!

The_Tozz and Dres 

01:21.927 --> 01:23.958
 And then came a day like no other

01:23.959 --> 01:25.698
 The most powerful heroes on Earth. .. 

01:25.699 --> 01:28.309
 were gathered against a common threat. 

01:28.310 --> 01:31.499
 that day, they became the
Avengers 

01:31.500 --> 01:33.531
 The Invincible Iron Man 

01:33.532 --> 01:35.755
 Thor, God of Thunder

01:35.756 --> 01:38.463
 Hulk, the strongest
Heroes 

01:38.464 --> 01:41.653
  Captain America, the first Avenger

01:41.654 --> 01:44.941

02:15.247 --> 02:17.947
humans is inadvisable to be submerged so long.

02:18.748 --> 02:20.348
Thank... for the tip...

02:20.749 --> 02:22.049
Vision.

02:22.050 --> 02:25.350
This is insane! We even
across the Universe!

02:25.351 --> 02:28.751
Seems to me that fell in the city
the other part of the Quinjet.

02:28.952 --> 02:31.452
If we survive,
may also have survived.

02:31.453 --> 02:34.453
JARVIS, open a channel
for their card.

02:40.056 --> 02:41.356
Nothing.

02:44.357 --> 02:46.157
But this seems to be something.

03:03.358 --> 03:04.658
Guys?

03:05.059 --> 03:06.859
'd Better give it a look! 

03:13.860 --> 03:17.060
Sorry, Ch
I could not land.

03:17.361 --> 03:19.061
We are alive ,
are not we?

03:19.062 --> 03:20.862
For me, it
is a good landing.

03:22.563 --> 03:24.463
Commander Corbeau okay?

03:24.464 --> 03:27.364
Unconscious.
But looks good.

03:27.365 --> 03:30.065
Guys, we're even
an alien planet?

03:30.066 --> 03:32.066
How do we get back home?

03:32.567 --> 03:34.567
I can not contact with Iron Man.

03:34.568 --> 03:36.168
What is this place,
Mahr Vehl?

03:36.369 --> 03:39.469
Hela.
We fall into the Kree homeworld.

03:39.470 --> 03:42.770
Everything here is so cold...
So impersonal...

03:43.171 --> 03:45.271
The krees
are so different from human as well?

03:45.572 --> 03:46.972
We are.

03:46.973 --> 03:50.173
Everything here is the expansion of service
Kree Empire.

03:54.374 --> 03:57.974
We fall into the safety zone.
We must leave here. Now.

03:57.975 --> 03:59.275
Security Zone?

03:59.276 --> 04:01.776
Do not look so safe.
There's nothing here.

04:10.777 --> 04:12.377
I'll rephrase the sentence ...

04:12.378 --> 04:14.178
The place looks pretty safe.

04:45.679 --> 04:46.979
Thor!

05:00.280 --> 05:02.380
Well, that was horrible...

05:02.381 --> 05:03.981
What is this place?

05:04.382 --> 05:07.082
Is manmade.
Or rather, by krees.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.383
Look...

05:08.884 --> 05:11.584
This is a place for training. 

05:11.585 --> 05:13.185
 These krees... 

05:13.786 --> 05:15.786
They send their warriors here...

05:15.787 --> 05:18.087
To train against these monsters.

05:18.088 --> 05:20.088
What kind of beings are these krees?

05:20.089 --> 05:22.689
Since
force his people to struggle with such creatures?

05:22.890 --> 05:25.690
Whatever. It was very easy
detonate one.

05:35.091 --> 05:36.391
If I remember correctly...

05:36.392 --> 05:39.392
Told me to never say
"very easy", was not it?

05:40.393 --> 05:42.693
I Vehl Mahr,
Geheneris Hala's son.

05:42.694 --> 05:45.194
Pluskommander Fleet Science Kree.

05:45.195 --> 05:47.295
I command you to get down their arms.

05:47.496 --> 05:49.796
We're
knowing who you are.

05:49.797 --> 05:51.097
Open fire!

05:53.398 --> 05:56.698
Vespa! Ms. Marvel!
Airstrike!

05:57.399 --> 05:59.399
Mahr Vehl!
Protect Corbeau!

06:09.100 --> 06:10.400
Toma!

06:10.801 --> 06:13.101
Carol,
they are many!

06:13.802 --> 06:15.102
Caution!

06:16.803 --> 06:18.103
Vespa!

06:22.204 --> 06:23.504
No!

06:51.905 --> 06:53.605
 I'll warn you now,
Ch .. 

06:53.606 --> 06:55.206
may not like what you see.

06:58.907 --> 07:00.207
I warned.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.708
Okay, I may even throw up...

07:13.709 --> 07:16.009
But can someone tell me
what is that thing?

07:16.010 --> 07:17.610
The Supreme Intelligence.

07:17.611 --> 07:20.611
A meeting of the greatest minds of the people
Kree.

07:21.312 --> 07:24.612
His bio-matter was made
to be the ultimate computer.

07:24.613 --> 07:27.313
Intelligence governs the Kree Empire.

07:27.514 --> 07:30.914
So it's a computer...
Brains powered by aliens?

07:30.915 --> 07:32.215
Ew!

07:32.216 --> 07:33.516
Supremor...

07:33.517 --> 07:36.517
These humans...
These Avengers...

07:36.518 --> 07:37.818
Save them.

07:37.819 --> 07:41.119
Specimens are exactly who had told him.

07:41.620 --> 07:42.920
Specimens?!

07:42.921 --> 07:45.021
You. .. betrayed us?

07:45.022 --> 07:46.822
I'm trying to save them.

07:46.823 --> 07:48.323
Supremor...

07:48.324 --> 07:50.724
Each human...
Are clear examples...

07:50.725 --> 07:52.725
Potential of humanity.

07:52.726 --> 07:55.026
Vespa can change its size. 

07:55.027 --> 07:58.327
 Your genetics was altered by an unknown particle
. 

07:58.328 --> 08:01.928
 Captain America turned
a super soldier... 

08:01.929 --> 08:03.529
 by a serum made by humans. 

08:03.530 --> 08:05.130
 Miss Marvel... 

08:05.131 --> 08:08.131
<i > His genetic power was changed by
Kree. 

08:08.332 --> 08:10.332
Human genetics is special.

08:10.333 --> 08:13.333
The species is on the brink of evolution
.

08:13.334 --> 08:16.334
Something that krees  long
lost the ability to do.

08:16.335 --> 08:19.335
 Generations trying to make the perfect soldier... 

08:19.336 --> 08:22.036
 eliminated the possibility of doing something new. 

08:22.237 --> 08:23.837
If you do, Supremor. ..

08:23.838 --> 08:26.538
If another wormhole opens
in their system...

08:26.539 --> 08:28.539
Mankind will be annihilated.

08:28.540 --> 08:30.540
They deserve a chance to live.

08:30.741 --> 08:31.841
And he speaks?

08:31.842 --> 08:35.842
I agree with your conjectures,
Captain Mahr Vehl.

08:35.842 --> 08:40.043
152397.2

08:40.044 --> 08:43.544
The Avengers defeated the Kree Sentry 459.

08:43.745 --> 08:47.545
305492.1

08:47.546 --> 08:50.046
The Avengers humiliated and arrested...

08:50.047 --> 08:51.947
The Great Accuser Kree.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.748
504928.2

08:55.749 --> 08:58.249
The Avengers defeated a warship Kree...

08:58.250 --> 09:00.750
And destroyed a wormhole.

09:00.751 --> 09:04.151
No other species has done such feats.

09:04.152 --> 09:07.752
Even the Skrulls
or Shi'ar.

09:07.753 --> 09:11.953
They have genetic potential never seen before.

09:12.254 --> 09:16.254
Of this power, the Empire needs
.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.555
Mahr Vehl...

09:17.556 --> 09:19.656
Supremor, thanks. I. ..

09:19.657 --> 09:23.657
The average human
will be used as a control specimen.

09:25.258 --> 09:28.758
The Avengers will be guinea pigs for experiments...

09:28.759 --> 09:30.559
And then dissected.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.260
- What?
- No!

09:32.561 --> 09:34.761
Vehl Mahr, do something!

09:37.162 --> 09:39.762
Wait!
Supremor, reconsider!

09:39.963 --> 09:43.763
Traitors of the Empire has no right to speak.

10:20.164 --> 10:21.764
Be prepared!

10:26.065 --> 10:28.365
I hope you come out better against me...

10:28.366 --> 10:29.966
Who went against the creatures.

10:29.967 --> 10:33.767
Only interceded because I thought that attacked children Kree.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.268
- T'Challa!
- Pantera! How?!

10:37.269 --> 10:39.969
You should not be...
Know... dead?

10:39.970 --> 10:42.570
The last time we saw you,
was falling into the sun!

10:42.571 --> 10:45.871
A sacrifice I would make
power to save the Earth.

10:45.872 --> 10:48.372
 But with the wormhole
still open... 

10:48.373 --> 10:51.673
 I thought iram
try to destroy it from the other side. 

10:52.374 --> 10:54.474
<i > The
Vaultion detected another ship... 

10:54.475 --> 10:56.475
 on the other side of the wormhole. 

10:56.476 --> 10:58.376
 When the portal began to close...

10:58.377 --> 11:00.777
 and realized that the sun would be out of danger
... 

11:00.778 --> 11:03.778
 used the teleportation of Vaultion to follow them. 

11:12.859 --> 11:15.828
 Vaultion
had caught the largest of ships Kree. 

11:16.320 --> 11:17.737
 And so I came on board... 

11:17.738 --> 11:20.122
 I started my path to tread
to you. 

11:22.426 --> 11:24.633
You were not hard to find.

11:24.634 --> 11:28.227
As always, my friends,
you make too much noise.

11:28.676 --> 11:30.033
We should leave now.

11:30.034 --> 11:32.680
The entire planet was alerted to its presence.

11:32.681 --> 11:35.395
Good to see you alive,
friend T'Challa.

11:35.396 --> 11:37.000
With attitude and everything.

11:37.623 --> 11:39.915
 The other Avengers are trapped in the Spine. 

11:39.916 --> 11:42.533
 Central Intelligence Supreme. 

11:56.198 --> 11:57.900
We can never well.

11:58.340 --> 12:00.357
Maybe we can hide in the city.

12:00.358 --> 12:03.256
No, the whole city is
military krees.

12:03.257 --> 12:05.432
And an army awaits us in the Spine.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.294
Every inch of this world is against us.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.972
Enough!
We are the Avengers!

12:10.973 --> 12:12.504
Do not run away!

12:12.505 --> 12:15.929
Ides Supreme Intelligence,
do you suppose our friends.

12:16.352 --> 12:18.728
I'll take care of krees !

12:57.746 --> 12:59.557
Hear me, Kree...

13:00.078 --> 13:02.759
If you find it even that ye are warriors...

13:03.659 --> 13:05.543
So proveis!

13:35.577 --> 13:36.955
Cap?

13:38.477 --> 13:40.781
Cap,
what's going on?

13:40.782 --> 13:42.114
Vespa!

14:06.215 --> 14:09.206
Avengers,
end up with these monsters!

14:30.667 --> 14:32.298
That was close.

14:38.606 --> 14:40.116
Okay, Cap?

14:40.623 --> 14:42.934
Glad to see you got, Pantera.

14:44.161 --> 14:45.783
We have work to do, folks.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.516
There is an alien computer upstairs...

14:47.517 --> 14:49.522
Called Supreme Intelligence.

14:49.523 --> 14:51.333
This thing controls the Kree Empire.

14:51.334 --> 14:53.514
We beat and can end...

14:53.515 --> 14:55.950
Kree with the threat to Earth once.

14:59.033 --> 15:01.575
Your resistance to my questions...

15:01.576 --> 15:04.150
Is not logical, Mahr Vehl.

15:04.151 --> 15:07.018
Your mind is exceptional.

15:07.019 --> 15:09.741
You could be part of the Intelligence.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.459
But his affection for these...

15:11.460 --> 15:14.459
Commits human animals.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.326
 Careful, sir. 

15:18.241 --> 15:20.659
Captain Marvel is one of us.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.270
No, you have to go.
You do not understand.

15:25.271 --> 15:26.844
He is too powerful.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.883
You are a kind exceptional...

15:30.884 --> 15:33.057
And show great potential.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.352
You have the power within themselves.

15:35.353 --> 15:40.121
But the Kree Empire,
I am supreme!

15:42.978 --> 15:45.388
His strength is amazing.

15:45.892 --> 15:49.746
But you fall,
is inevitable.

16:19.505 --> 16:21.355
Shells it is too powerful!

16:21.356 --> 16:23.294
Vision,
I need you...

16:41.116 --> 16:43.665
You chose poorly,
Mahr Vehl.

16:43.666 --> 16:47.802
The earth is full of
guinea pigs for experiments.

16:47.803 --> 16:50.851
These Avengers
are expendable.

16:50.852 --> 16:52.911
Like you.

16:55.625 --> 17:00.076
Your
army proved unworthy, vile creature!

17:00.620 --> 17:02.398
To You Now!

17:03.910 --> 17:05.429
Send in view!

17:10.534 --> 17:12.496
Vision, grab it!

17:15.012 --> 17:16.637
Connecting.

17:17.415 --> 17:20.606
Connection established, starting
outlet.

17:20.607 --> 17:24.020
Its programming is nothing, nothing...

17:24.021 --> 17:26.794
Error,
I.A. strange detected.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.935
The power of a thousand alien minds.

17:30.495 --> 17:31.835
Error.

17:32.701 --> 17:34.961
Shutdown started.

17:42.598 --> 17:43.984
Vision!

17:45.332 --> 17:48.749
I got hit,
but only temporarily.

17:51.031 --> 17:52.953
Intelligence is restarting.

17:52.954 --> 17:54.773
I could see in his mind.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.912
He will order the attack on the city of all troops
Kree.

17:57.913 --> 18:00.401
Not survive such a massacre.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.703
And you can not stop him?

18:05.416 --> 18:09.004
No, I'm trying to slow him down but his mind...

18:09.005 --> 18:10.756
She is too powerful.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.269
I can stop him,
blowing the whole thing.

18:15.090 --> 18:16.437
Wait.

18:16.869 --> 18:18.391
This is not...

18:22.983 --> 18:25.110
This is not your responsibility.

18:25.111 --> 18:26.532
Is mine.

18:26.533 --> 18:29.722
Error, I am the Supreme...
Error...

18:29.723 --> 18:33.259
Vai Kree Empire...
Error. Error.

18:33.260 --> 18:35.713
Initial Reboot:
enabled.

18:35.714 --> 18:38.498
Designation:
Supreme Intelligence.

18:38.499 --> 18:42.232
I was done with the purpose of creating a
Cosmic Cube.

18:42.233 --> 18:43.543
Error.

18:44.182 --> 18:47.581
Intelligence, his mind was isolated biological
.

18:48.025 --> 18:50.321
It was separated from computers Kree.

18:50.322 --> 18:52.123
 I'ma Kree. 

18:52.124 --> 18:54.878
This is my decision.
My choice.

18:59.342 --> 19:02.645
The Kree
conquest of civilization after civilization...

19:03.316 --> 19:05.175
Species after...

19:06.061 --> 19:07.924
Must end.

19:07.925 --> 19:10.140
First Contact:
Skrulls.

19:10.141 --> 19:11.753
The Skrulls are beasts...

19:11.754 --> 19:14.738
Error, barbaric Kree...

19:14.739 --> 19:17.623
Like the native Cotati... error.

19:22.538 --> 19:24.182
Intelligence live.

19:24.183 --> 19:26.035
But she's harmless now.

19:26.036 --> 19:28.676
After living on Earth with humanity...

19:29.327 --> 19:31.639
After spending time with the Avengers...

19:32.551 --> 19:34.522
Something in me changed.

19:35.459 --> 19:38.237
- I had no choice.
- Mahr Vehl.

19:39.039 --> 19:40.631
What happens now?

19:41.228 --> 19:44.153
- What have you done...
- Will destroy the Empire.

19:45.087 --> 19:47.078
Without the leadership of the Intelligence...

19:47.079 --> 19:49.021
The military will unravel.

19:49.878 --> 19:52.030
There will be chaos, riots...

19:52.506 --> 19:54.463
All systems will fall.

19:54.464 --> 19:56.564
The people Kree
meet its end.

19:56.565 --> 19:58.698
There is another choice,
Mahr Vehl.

19:59.130 --> 20:01.180
You can be an example to the Kree.

20:01.181 --> 20:03.507
You can
krees show that there is another option.

20:03.508 --> 20:05.046
A better way.

20:05.047 --> 20:06.793
You can lead them.

20:12.514 --> 20:13.868
Maybe.

20:14.281 --> 20:17.108
Maybe my people can learn from humanity.

20:17.639 --> 20:19.963
Maybe there's a future for us.

20:20.493 --> 20:23.492
A future without a Supreme Intelligence.

20:30.288 --> 20:32.415
This is quite a sight.

20:34.124 --> 20:35.496
Truth.

20:35.497 --> 20:38.205
For however you like
of your company, friends...

20:38.206 --> 20:40.730
A journey of five weeks
by this subspace...

20:40.731 --> 20:42.295
Is a long time.

20:42.296 --> 20:44.339
Especially when you have to stand...

20:44.340 --> 20:46.082
Complaints of Hawkeye.

20:46.724 --> 20:48.096
's Amazing.

20:48.097 --> 20:52.396
Think , Cap, eight of us,
moved alien empire.

20:52.397 --> 20:54.864
The Mahr Vehl
Avengers looked at as an example.

20:54.865 --> 20:56.508
Can it be to Earth.

20:56.509 --> 20:58.539
Well, whatever
what the future will bring...

20:58.540 --> 21:00.823
'm Just happy to be home.

21:01.305 --> 21:07.266
