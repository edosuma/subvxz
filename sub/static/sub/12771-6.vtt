00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:08.667 --> 00:12.125
(fussing)

00:12.166 --> 00:15.000
HELLO.

00:15.041 --> 00:16.625
(chuckles)

00:16.667 --> 00:18.125
OH.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.458
(chuckles)

00:23.500 --> 00:24.750
(Mrs. Clemons)
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

00:24.792 --> 00:26.041
OPEN ADOPTIONS ARE NEGOTIABLE.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.750
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DECIDING

00:27.792 --> 00:29.792
WHAT MAKES
EACH OF YOU COMFORTABLE.

00:29.834 --> 00:32.041
WELL, WHATEVER JUDI NEEDS...
I'M GONNA BE REALLY BUSY
WITH SCHOOL, SO...

00:32.083 --> 00:33.041
I'M SORRY.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.333
I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD.

00:34.375 --> 00:36.208
NO, I WAS
JUST GOING TO SAY,

00:36.250 --> 00:38.041
I AM SO GRATEFUL TO YOU,
JUDI,

00:38.083 --> 00:40.166
SO WHATEVER YOU NEED
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE...

00:40.208 --> 00:42.542
I FEEL COMFORTABLE.
I-I MEAN, IT'S...

00:42.583 --> 00:44.333
UM...

00:44.375 --> 00:46.542
I DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY.

00:46.583 --> 00:49.667
MILDRED, IS THERE
SOME SORT OF MODEL FOR THIS?

00:49.709 --> 00:51.542
I MEAN, WHAT DO PEOPLE
USUALLY DO?

00:51.583 --> 00:55.041
I-I WANT JUDI TO BE
A PART OF HENRY'S LIFE

00:55.083 --> 00:56.834
IF SHE WANTS TO BE.

00:56.875 --> 00:58.917
UM, I'D LIKE HIM TO KNOW
WHERE HE COMES FROM.

00:58.959 --> 01:02.000
BUT, UH, MAYBE SOME GUIDELINES
WOULD BE HELPFUL.

01:02.041 --> 01:03.208
SURE.

01:03.250 --> 01:06.333
A COMMON SETUP IS
WEEKLY PHOTOS, MONTHLY VISITS.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.875
JUDI?

01:11.667 --> 01:12.917
SURE.

01:12.959 --> 01:14.709
YEAH, OKAY.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.625
THIS IS AN OPEN ADOPTION.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.083
I HAVE TO BE OPEN,
AND I DON'T FEEL OPEN.

01:21.125 --> 01:23.709
I FEEL LIKE I WANNA...

01:23.750 --> 01:25.500
(lowered voice)
TAKE HENRY AND RUN.

01:25.542 --> 01:27.041
I MEAN,
WHAT IF SHE HATES ME?

01:27.083 --> 01:28.667
WHAT IF SHE THINKS
I'M DOING A TERRIBLE JOB?

01:28.709 --> 01:30.750
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
YEAH? WELL, THEN
WHY DID SHE COME NOW?

01:30.792 --> 01:32.041
I MEAN, NO VISITS
IN EIGHT MONTHS.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.709
NO REPLIES
TO ANY OF MY E-MAILS.

01:33.750 --> 01:34.667
WHY NOW?

01:34.709 --> 01:36.041
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TAKEN HER
THIS LONG

01:36.083 --> 01:37.208
TO WRAP HER HEAD
AROUND ALL THIS.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.750
I MEAN, SHE DID HAVE A BABY
AND GIVE HIM AWAY.

01:39.792 --> 01:42.333
OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING
NOT EVERYTHING'S ABOUT ME?

01:42.375 --> 01:44.083
A LITTLE BIT,
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

01:44.125 --> 01:45.625
BUT ONLY IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER.

01:45.667 --> 01:48.208
IT DOES.

01:48.250 --> 01:50.083
THANK YOU.

01:50.125 --> 01:52.333
OKAY, HENRY.

01:52.375 --> 01:55.458
LET'S GO MEET
THE LADY WHO MADE YOU.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.750
HMM?

01:56.792 --> 01:59.792
(Henry coos)

02:02.959 --> 02:04.041
JUDI.

02:04.083 --> 02:07.083
HI. UM, I-I BROUGHT A...

02:08.709 --> 02:10.375
WOW.

02:10.417 --> 02:13.041
HE IS ADVANCED IN ALL MILESTONES
EXCEPT PEEKABOO,

02:13.083 --> 02:14.458
BUT WE'LL GET THERE.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.500
AND HE LOVES, UH, TIGGER
AND MASHED CARROTS.

02:16.542 --> 02:19.041
I MEAN, WELL,
ALL THINGS ORANGE.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.291
(laughs)

02:20.333 --> 02:21.542
HE'S SO BIG.

02:21.583 --> 02:22.500
YEAH, NOT TOO BIG,
THOUGH.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.041
I MEAN, HE'S A FAT BABY,

02:24.083 --> 02:25.709
BUT IN A HEALTHY
FAT BABY WAY,

02:25.750 --> 02:26.875
NOT IN A BAD FAT BABY WAY.

02:26.917 --> 02:30.250
YOU KNOW, HE'S GOOD.
I'M DOING A GOOD JOB.

02:30.291 --> 02:32.291
I'M...

02:32.333 --> 02:33.750
TALKING TOO MUCH.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.041
(all laugh)

02:35.083 --> 02:36.125
UM...

02:36.166 --> 02:38.625
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I HELD HIM?

02:40.083 --> 02:41.125
OF COURSE.

02:41.166 --> 02:42.792
UM...

02:46.750 --> 02:49.417
HI. HI.

02:49.458 --> 02:50.625
HI, HENRY.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.166
HEY, REMEMBER ME?

02:52.208 --> 02:54.041
I'M...

02:54.083 --> 02:55.625
I'M JUDI.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.542
YEAH. HI.

02:58.583 --> 03:06.000
YEAH.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.792
(Jake) OKAY, HENRY.
LOOK OVER HERE.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.792
LOOK AT TIGGER.
WAVE TO TIGGER, HONEY.

03:09.834 --> 03:11.041
(camera beeps)
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.792
OH, HONEY, I GOTTA GET
A NEW MEMORY CARD.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.834
IT'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE.
OKAY.

03:14.875 --> 03:18.542
OH. DID YOU, UM,
WANT TO GIVE HIM THE BUNNY?

03:18.583 --> 03:19.709
WHAT?

03:19.750 --> 03:20.750
I NOTICED YOU BROUGHT
THE STUFFED ANIMAL.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.000
DID YOU WANT TO GIVE IT
TO HIM?

03:22.041 --> 03:25.458
OH, YEAH. UM... NO.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.250
IT KINDA SEEMS LIKE
HE'S GOT EVERYTHING HE NEEDS.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.625
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
I WAS, UM...

03:31.667 --> 03:35.375
(chuckles) I WAS REALLY NERVOUS
BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.

03:35.417 --> 03:39.458
WHY? UM, YOU'RE THE MOST
TOGETHER PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.041
I... I JUST THINK
YOU WANTING TO SEE HIM,

03:42.083 --> 03:44.792
IT JUST, UM...
IT SURPRISED ME, YOU KNOW?

03:44.834 --> 03:48.041
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T SHOWN
MUCH INTEREST UNTIL NOW.

03:48.083 --> 03:49.792
I MEAN, I SENT YOU PHOTOS,
YOU DIDN'T REPLY.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.667
AND YOU HAVEN'T SCHEDULED
ANY VISITS UNTIL NOW.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.583
I'M JUST...
I DON'T KNOW.

03:53.625 --> 03:57.166
I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT...
WHAT CHANGED.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.583
I DON'T OPEN
MOST OF YOUR E-MAILS.

03:59.625 --> 04:02.083
IT'S NOT THAT
I'M NOT INTERESTED, BUT, UM,

04:02.125 --> 04:04.291
I DON'T KNOW. IT--
IT'S BEEN HARD.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.792
(babbles)
(laughs)

04:05.834 --> 04:07.041
OH. OH.

04:07.083 --> 04:08.667
YOU KNOW THAT THING

04:08.709 --> 04:10.041
WHERE YOU'RE AFRAID
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.417
I-I MEAN,
YOU DO OTHER STUFF,

04:12.458 --> 04:15.667
BUT ALL YOU CAN THINK ABOUT
IS THAT YOU FORGOT SOMETHING.

04:15.709 --> 04:16.875
YEAH. I HATE THAT FEELING.

04:16.917 --> 04:18.709
SINCE I GAVE HENRY
TO YOU,

04:18.750 --> 04:20.750
I-I FEEL LIKE THAT...

04:20.792 --> 04:21.959
ALL THE TIME.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.667
I MEAN, E-EXCEPT NOW.

04:23.709 --> 04:26.041
JUST SEEING HIM

04:26.083 --> 04:27.500
AND HOW WELL HE'S DOING...
(babbles)

04:27.542 --> 04:30.667
I DON'T KNOW.
THE FEELING'S GONE RIGHT NOW.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.625
(babbles)

04:32.667 --> 04:34.709
(chuckles) WELL, I CAN
SEND YOU PHOTOS EVERY DAY,

04:34.750 --> 04:37.125
AND YOU REALLY CAN SCHEDULE
MONTHLY VISITS.

04:37.166 --> 04:38.667
I'M STILL OPEN TO THAT.

04:38.709 --> 04:41.041
YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE COOL.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.834
BUT, UM, I WAS HOPING,

04:42.875 --> 04:44.667
IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH
OR WHATEVER,

04:44.709 --> 04:47.709
MAYBE I COULD SEE HENRY
AGAIN SOONER?

04:47.750 --> 04:49.417
LIKE TOMORROW?

04:51.208 --> 04:53.000
SURE.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.667
(Sam) WAIT.

04:56.709 --> 04:58.041
SO SHE HASN'T VISITED
IN EIGHT MONTHS,

04:58.083 --> 05:00.041
AND NOW SHE WANTS TO VISIT
TWO DAYS IN A ROW?

05:00.083 --> 05:01.792
IT'S TOO MUCH,
AND SHE KNOWS IT.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.083
IS JUDI REGRETTING

05:03.125 --> 05:04.667
HER DECISION TO PUT HENRY
UP FOR ADOPTION?

05:04.709 --> 05:06.500
I DIDN'T GET THAT IMPRESSION.

05:06.542 --> 05:07.750
(mouth full) WELL, MAYBE SEEING
THAT HER CHILD'S WELL CARED FOR

05:07.792 --> 05:09.250
WILL ACTUALLY HELP HER
MOVE ON.

05:09.291 --> 05:10.500
(Violet)
THE POINT OF OPEN ADOPTION

05:10.542 --> 05:11.542
IS NOT FOR THE BIRTH MOTHER
TO MOVE ON.

05:11.583 --> 05:12.792
THE POINT IS
TO HAVE THE BIRTH MOTHER

05:12.834 --> 05:14.083
INVOLVED IN THE CHILD'S LIFE,

05:14.125 --> 05:16.291
WHICH... CAN BE
A POWERFUL THING.

05:16.333 --> 05:17.500
IT'S A DOUCHEY THING.

05:17.542 --> 05:18.750
COOPER.

05:18.792 --> 05:19.959
YOU DON'T GIVE A KID UP

05:20.000 --> 05:21.542
AND THEN HANG AROUND
CONFUSING EVERYBODY.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.166
I MEAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT THAT WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE.

05:23.208 --> 05:25.333
(Violet) JUST BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE IT

05:25.375 --> 05:27.041
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT IT'S AN INVALID CHOICE.

05:27.083 --> 05:30.542
IS ANYBODY ELSE HERE
ADOPTED THAT THEY KNOW OF?

05:30.583 --> 05:33.041
NO? OKAY. THEN I GET MORE SAY
THAN ANY OF YOU PEOPLE.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.542
AND I SAY IT'S DOUCHEY.

05:34.583 --> 05:35.750
ADDISON, MOVE TO BURBANK.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.041
SELL THE HOUSE, DISAPPEAR.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.500
HENRY DOESN'T NEED
THIS KIND OF CONFUSION.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.709
(Sheldon) JUDI'S PRESENCE
COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO HENRY.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.041
IF HE KNOWS HER,
HE WON'T HAVE FANTASIES

05:42.083 --> 05:46.041
THAT HIS BIRTH MOTHER IS A SPY
OR A QUEEN OR A SUPERMODEL.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.000
THOSE SOUND LIKE
YOUR FANTASIES.

05:48.041 --> 05:51.041
THE POINT IS, IF WE REMOVE
THE ELEMENT OF MYSTERY,

05:51.083 --> 05:53.041
HENRY WON'T HAVE ANY ILLUSIONS
THAT JUDI WOULD'VE MADE HIM

05:53.083 --> 05:55.083
A BETTER LIFE
THAN THE ONE HE HAS NOW.

05:55.125 --> 05:56.750
(Sam) WHAT IF THE BIRTH MOTHER
IS A BAD INFLUENCE?

05:56.792 --> 05:58.000
WELL,
THAT'S RELATIVELY RARE.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.333
THESE WOMEN TEND TO BE
SELFLESS,

05:59.375 --> 06:00.834
ENVISIONING A FUTURE
FOR THEIR BABY

06:00.875 --> 06:02.667
THAT THEY ARE
UNABLE TO PROVIDE.

06:02.709 --> 06:05.250
THEY ALSO TEND TO HAVE GOALS
THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE

06:05.291 --> 06:08.041
WITH PREMATURE PARENTHOOD.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.333
PREMATURE PARENTHOOD?
IS THAT A THING?

06:10.375 --> 06:12.250
IT IS NOW.
OH.

06:12.291 --> 06:14.000
(Sheldon) THE ARRANGEMENT CAN BE
GOOD FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED,

06:14.041 --> 06:16.041
PROVIDED ADEQUATE BOUNDARIES
ARE SET.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.417
(Charlotte) OH,
THAT CAN BE TOUGH, THOUGH.

06:17.458 --> 06:18.625
IF JUDI'S AROUND ALL THE TIME,

06:18.667 --> 06:20.166
SHE MIGHT START WEIGHING IN
ON PARENTING DECISIONS.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.417
(Violet) IT'S NOT ABOUT WEIGHING
IN ON PARENTING DECISIONS.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.041
IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE

06:24.083 --> 06:26.000
THAT EVERYONE
IN THE ADOPTION TRIAD IS...

06:28.083 --> 06:30.208
ADDISON.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.041
SWEETHEART.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.792
(sniffles)

06:33.834 --> 06:36.583
(voice breaking)
I'M HIS MOM.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.542
I JUST WANT TO BE HIS MOM.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.250
DR. CARLSMITH,
I'M DR. PETERSON.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.291
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE HAVING
SOME ABDOMINAL DISCOMFORT.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.041
IN THE RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.583
START AN I.V.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.041
IT COULD BE A FEW THINGS.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.667
IT COULD BE,
BUT IT'S NOT.

06:53.709 --> 06:55.458
I HAVE GASTRIC CANCER.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.041
OKAY.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.959
LET ME SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.542
WHERE'D YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

07:02.583 --> 07:04.083
U.S.C. RESIDENCY
AND FELLOWSHIP.

07:04.125 --> 07:06.417
MED SCHOOL AT STANFORD.
THANK GOODNESS.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.667
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D SAY
ONE OF THOSE QUACK SCHOOLS.

07:08.709 --> 07:11.208
MY FIRST DAY,
MY FIRST E.R. ROTATION,

07:11.250 --> 07:13.041
A WOMAN IN LABOR
PRESENTED IN FRANK BREECH.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.750
I HAD JUST READ YOUR PAPER

07:14.792 --> 07:16.125
ON THE EXTERNAL CEPHALIC
VERSION TECHNIQUE.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.709
MM.
THE DESCRIPTION WAS SO CLEAR,
I PERFORMED IT FLAWLESSLY.

07:18.750 --> 07:19.667
HMM.

07:19.709 --> 07:21.208
I SAVED HER LIFE
AND THEN THE BABY'S.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.667
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT LUCKY.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.417
WITH YOUR HELP.
OHH! (gasps)

07:24.458 --> 07:26.458
(panting)
FENTANYL, 50 I.V.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.083
AND LET'S GET
AN ABDOMINAL C.T.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.333
VIVIAN, IS THERE SOMEONE
WE CAN CALL FOR YOU,

07:31.375 --> 07:32.667
SOMEONE WHO CAN BE HERE
WITH YOU?

07:32.709 --> 07:34.792
NO, NO.
NO NEED TO CALL ANYONE.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.750
I DON'T WANT TO BE
A BOTHER.

07:37.792 --> 07:40.500
OKAY, JUST GIVE ME A CALL
WHEN SHE'S AT 7 CENTIMETERS.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.041
NOW WE TAKE IT ALL
FOR GRANTED,

07:42.083 --> 07:43.959
BUT AT THE TIME,
THERE WAS NO TREATMENT.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.792
SHE'S THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY
CAME UP WITH THE IDEA

07:45.834 --> 07:47.709
TO PUT THE TEMPORARY PLUG
IN THE FETAL TRACHEA.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.166
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
DR. VIVIAN CARLSMITH?

07:50.208 --> 07:51.458
YEAH.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.667
SHE'S IN THE E.R.

07:52.709 --> 07:54.542
(James)
I'M GOING TO ADMIT YOU.

07:54.583 --> 07:58.250
OH, I'VE ALREADY SPENT TOO MUCH
OF MY LIFE IN HOSPITALS.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.250
YEAH, BUT WE HAVE
REALLY GOOD PUDDING.

08:00.291 --> 08:01.458
VIVIAN.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.333
ADDISON.
SORRY, ADDISON.

08:03.375 --> 08:04.500
THE CHART DIDN'T INDICATE
YOU'RE HER DOCTOR.

08:04.542 --> 08:07.792
OH! NO, I'M NOT.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.792
SHE'S MY FRIEND,
MY MENTOR.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.375
OH, THAT WORD
MAKES ME FEEL OLD.

08:12.417 --> 08:14.041
OH, NO. SHE TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.166
WHY ARE YOU IN THE E.R.?

08:15.208 --> 08:16.417
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN L.A.?

08:16.458 --> 08:17.750
I'M FINE.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.750
U.C.L.A. HIRED ME AS A PART
OF THEIR GUEST LECTURE SERIES.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.709
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE STILL
IN SEATTLE

08:22.750 --> 08:24.333
WITH DEREK AND RICHARD.

08:24.375 --> 08:25.792
YEAH, WELL, I TOOK A PAGE
OUT OF YOUR BOOK

08:25.834 --> 08:28.041
AND DECIDED TO MOVE
TO A WARMER CLIMATE.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.709
MM.
I JUST, YOU KNOW,

08:29.750 --> 08:31.625
DIDN'T WAIT UNTIL I RETIRED,
THAT'S ALL.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.750
THE PUPIL SURPASSES
THE TEACHER.
(laughs)

08:33.792 --> 08:35.083
OH. (groans)

08:35.125 --> 08:37.083
CAN YOU GIVE HER SOMETHING?

08:37.125 --> 08:39.500
ALREADY DID.
ANOTHER 50 FENTANYL I.V.

08:39.542 --> 08:41.375
OKAY, VIVIAN,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:41.417 --> 08:43.041
YOU TELL ME.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.667
ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN,

08:44.709 --> 08:46.041
NAUSEA, BLOATING--

08:46.083 --> 08:48.875
YOU WANT ME TO PLAY
FIND THE DIAGNOSIS NOW?

08:48.917 --> 08:50.041
MM.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.625
ALL RIGHT, FINE. UH...

08:51.667 --> 08:52.625
CHOLEOCYSTITIS?

08:52.667 --> 08:53.834
PANCREATITIS?

08:53.875 --> 08:55.834
WRONG,
BUT IN FAIRNESS,

08:55.875 --> 08:57.333
I LEFT SOMETHING OUT.

08:57.375 --> 09:00.125
FAMILY HISTORY
OF C-H-1 MUTATION.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.625
GASTROCARCINOMA.

09:04.667 --> 09:09.959
YOU ALWAYS WERE
MY SMARTEST STUDENT.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.583
(sighs)

09:13.917 --> 09:15.250
THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

09:15.291 --> 09:17.625
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

09:17.667 --> 09:20.792
TOO... LONG AGO.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.000
WHAT'S YOUR TREATMENT PLAN?

09:22.041 --> 09:23.250
I ORDERED AN ABDOMINAL C.T.

09:23.291 --> 09:24.709
AND I'LL ADMIT HER
FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.000
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.500
BUT MY FEAR
IS THAT HER SYMPTOMS MEAN

09:27.542 --> 09:29.041
THE CANCER HAS METASTASIZED
TO THE LIVER.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.667
IT'S AN EASY DIAGNOSIS TO MISS,

09:31.709 --> 09:32.875
AND IT'S ALMOST NEVER CAUGHT
IN TIME.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.667
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE A BOTHER,

09:34.709 --> 09:36.166
BUT SHE REALLY SHOULD HAVE
FAMILY HERE.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.667
ALL SHE HAD WAS A SISTER,
AND SHE DIED YEARS AGO.

09:38.709 --> 09:39.583
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.333
(man) DR. PETERSON!

09:42.917 --> 09:44.041
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.709
SHE WAS UPSTAIRS IN P.T.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.959
SHE TRIED TO WALK
AND SHE FELL, HIT HER HEAD.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.250
MOMMY, IT HURTS.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.750
I KNOW, BABY. I KNOW.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.041
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SWEETIE?

09:53.083 --> 09:54.667
GWEN.
I'M DR. JAMES,

09:54.709 --> 09:57.041
AND WE'RE GONNA FIX THAT
RIGHT UP, OKAY? I PROMISE.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.208
(people speaking indistinctly)

09:58.250 --> 10:00.041
YOU DID THIS.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.709
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.458
I-I'M SORRY?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.625
YOU DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE ME,
DO YOU?

10:05.667 --> 10:06.917
SEAN PATRUCHI.

10:06.959 --> 10:08.500
EIGHT YEARS AGO...
RIGHT.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.041
IN UTERO SURGERY--

10:10.083 --> 10:11.542
SPINA BIFIDA. I'M SORRY.
IT JUST TOOK ME A MINUTE.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.542
YOU SAID MY BABY
WOULD BE OKAY,

10:13.583 --> 10:15.500
PROMISED ME
SHE'D HAVE A GOOD LIFE.

10:15.542 --> 10:16.667
YOU LIED.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.458
LISTEN TO ME.
I CAN SEE YOU'RE UPSET--

10:18.500 --> 10:20.041
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.750
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH HELL
SINCE GWEN WAS BORN.

10:22.792 --> 10:24.750
YOU WERE MY DOCTOR.
YOU SHOULD'VE...

10:24.792 --> 10:27.542
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.917
I SHOULD'VE HAD
AN ABORTION.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.333
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
FAMILY NAMES?

10:47.375 --> 10:50.291
IF THERE'S A GIRL,
I LIKE MARJORIE.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.250
(chuckles) YEAH, BUT--

10:51.291 --> 10:53.250
BUT MARJORIE'S
NOT A FAMILY NAME.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.041
THAT'S THE NAME
OF YOUR HORSE.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.041
WHOM I LOVED MORE THAN
EITHER OF MY BROTHERS.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.125
(laughs)

10:58.166 --> 10:59.333
ANY GOOD GRANDPARENT NAMES?

10:59.375 --> 11:01.041
WALTER, MIRIAM, IRVING,
AND RIVKA?

11:01.083 --> 11:02.291
IT'S TOO WASPY, THOUGH,
RIGHT?

11:02.333 --> 11:03.417
MM.

11:03.458 --> 11:04.333
I FEEL BAD FOR ADDISON.

11:04.375 --> 11:05.959
IT CANNOT BE EASY

11:06.000 --> 11:07.959
WITH HENRY'S BIRTH MOM
COMING AROUND ALL THE TIME.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.333
IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR US
TO MAKE PARENTING DECISIONS,

11:10.375 --> 11:12.208
AND WE CHOSE EACH OTHER.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.500
RIGHT?

11:13.542 --> 11:15.041
I MEAN, IF YOU MAKE
THE HONORABLE DECISION

11:15.083 --> 11:17.041
TO GIVE UP YOUR CHILD
SO THEY CAN HAVE A BETTER LIFE,

11:17.083 --> 11:20.041
THEN YOU NEED TO BACK OFF
AND LET THEM HAVE THAT LIFE.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.041
THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH.

11:22.083 --> 11:24.041
EVERYBODY'S NEEDS
ARE DIFFERENT.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.583
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT,

11:25.625 --> 11:27.583
BUT, LIKE, I'VE IMAGINED WHAT IT
WOULD BE LIKE IF, YOU KNOW,

11:27.625 --> 11:30.041
ONE DAY MY BIRTH MOTHER
JUST KNOCKED ON THE DOOR...

11:30.083 --> 11:32.625
YOU ARE CURIOUS ABOUT HER.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.166
WELL, YEAH,
OF COURSE I AM,

11:34.208 --> 11:37.166
BUT NOBODY GIVES UP A CHILD
UNLESS THEY'RE IN CRISIS.

11:37.208 --> 11:40.417
SO WHO AM I TO GO
AND... TRY AND FIND HER?

11:40.458 --> 11:42.041
I MEAN, WHAT IF THAT MADE
HER LIFE WORSE?

11:42.083 --> 11:44.041
I'VE HAD AN AMAZING LIFE,
AND SHE'S RESPONSIBLE,

11:44.083 --> 11:48.208
SO I WANT MY BIRTH MOTHER
TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE, TOO.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.375
YOU WERE ADOPTED?

11:50.417 --> 11:52.250
YEAH.

11:52.291 --> 11:55.041
YEAH, I W--I WAS.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.375
THE WOMAN
WHO GAVE BIRTH TO ME

11:57.417 --> 11:58.417
COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF ME--

11:58.458 --> 12:02.291
WELL, I-I KNOW
WHAT ADOPTED IS.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.250
WHAT'S HER NAME?

12:04.291 --> 12:06.875
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HER.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.250
NOTHING?

12:08.291 --> 12:09.417
NOPE.

12:11.291 --> 12:13.875
I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL. ARE YOU READY?

12:13.917 --> 12:16.208
YEAH.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.083
LET'S GO.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.875
(Henry babbles)

12:23.917 --> 12:25.709
(chuckles) HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.250
(laughs)
HE'S PERFECT, RIGHT?

12:28.291 --> 12:30.041
I KNOW YOU WENT
BACK AND FORTH ABOUT IT,

12:30.083 --> 12:33.417
BUT I ALWAYS SUSPECTED
YOU'D DECIDE TO HAVE CHILDREN.

12:33.458 --> 12:34.875
(laughs)

12:34.917 --> 12:37.834
YOU DIDN'T GO FOR THAT
NATURAL BIRTH MALARKEY, DID YOU?

12:37.875 --> 12:39.083
ACTUALLY,
I DIDN'T DELIVER.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.041
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY, I DID,
I GUESS.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.458
I WAS THE O.B. ON THE CASE.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.041
BUT THE BIRTH MOTHER--JUDI--

12:44.083 --> 12:46.333
IS THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY
PUSHED HIM OUT.

12:46.375 --> 12:47.834
I... I ADOPTED HENRY.

12:47.875 --> 12:49.083
YOU DID?

12:49.125 --> 12:53.041
YES, I DID. ACTUALLY, JUDI
CAME TO VISIT US YESTERDAY.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.291
WAIT. THE BIRTH MOTHER
VISITED YOU?

12:56.333 --> 12:57.250
WHY?

12:57.291 --> 12:58.750
I DON'T KNOW.

12:58.792 --> 12:59.959
I MEAN, I HADN'T HEARD
FROM HER IN MONTHS.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.041
I THOUGHT I WOULD,
BUT I DIDN'T.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.333
AND THEN YESTERDAY,
SHE WANTED TO VISIT.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.333
IT W--I--IT WAS...
IT WAS ACTUALLY OKAY.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.625
(Henry babbles)

13:05.667 --> 13:06.875
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.375
SHE WANTED TO SEE HENRY,
AND YOU LET HER?

13:08.417 --> 13:10.417
YEAH, IT'S PART OF
OUR ADOPTION AGREEMENT.

13:11.834 --> 13:15.166
TO HOLD A CHILD
YOU GAVE UP...

13:15.208 --> 13:16.917
ARE YOU OKAY?

13:16.959 --> 13:18.917
(voice breaks) TO KNOW
YOUR BABY IS SAFE...

13:18.959 --> 13:22.000
VIVIAN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:23.375 --> 13:25.166
I CAN'T. I...

13:25.208 --> 13:26.959
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.375
WELL, YOU CAN TELL ME.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.000
WHAT IS IT?

13:32.083 --> 13:35.458
IN 1954, I HAD A BABY.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.250
I WAS 15.

13:38.291 --> 13:41.041
I NEVER GOT TO HOLD HER.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.792
THE NUNS GAVE HER
TO A CATHOLIC FAMILY.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.375
(cries) I HAD A BABY,

13:47.417 --> 13:50.333
AND THEY TOOK HER AWAY
FROM ME.

13:54.583 --> 13:58.000
SAM, WHEN IS YOUR TV SHOW
GONNA BE ON THE AIR?

13:58.041 --> 14:00.041
OH, IT'S JUST A PILOT, SO...

14:00.083 --> 14:02.417
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE ON...
THINGS.

14:02.458 --> 14:05.375
DAMN. I WAS EXCITED TO START
CALLING YOU THE SITUATION.

14:05.417 --> 14:06.500
(laughs)

14:06.542 --> 14:07.917
EXCUSE ME.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.792
I'M LOOKING FOR
A DR. ADDISON FORBES MONTGOMERY.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.333
OH, THAT'S ME.

14:11.375 --> 14:14.166
YOU'VE BEEN SERVED.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.458
WHAT IS IT?

14:21.500 --> 14:23.834
I'M BEING SUED
BY MY FORMER PATIENT--

14:23.875 --> 14:25.375
SEAN PATRUCHI--

14:25.417 --> 14:28.041
FOR WRONGFUL BIRTH
OF HER DAUGHTER.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.375
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:29.417 --> 14:31.041
IT MEANS THE PATIENT BELIEVES
HER BABY SHOULDN'T EXIST.

14:31.083 --> 14:33.041
YEAH, BUT SHE'S NOT A BABY.
GWEN IS 7 YEARS OLD.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.417
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

14:34.458 --> 14:36.208
WHEN SEAN WAS PREGNANT,
I DIAGNOSED GWEN, HER BABY,

14:36.250 --> 14:37.417
WITH SPINA BIFIDA.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.959
I GAVE HER OPTIONS
AND I RECOMMENDED FETAL SURGERY.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.375
WELL, IT WAS A CUTTING-EDGE
PROCEDURE AT THE TIME.

14:41.417 --> 14:43.166
IT'S NOT A SURPRISE
IF THAT WASN'T A SUCCESS.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.959
(Addison) NO, IT WORKED.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.417
SHE JUST HIT HER HEAD IN P.T.
SHE'S STARTING TO WALK.

14:47.458 --> 14:48.709
THAT'S A MIRACLE.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.041
APPARENTLY
NOT MIRACLE ENOUGH.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.792
NO, I RAN INTO SEAN
YESTERDAY IN THE E.R.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.041
SHE FLIPPED OUT ON ME

14:53.083 --> 14:55.250
AND SHE SAID SHE WANTED
A NORMAL LIFE FOR HER DAUGHTER

14:55.291 --> 14:56.709
AND BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T GET IT,

14:56.750 --> 14:58.458
SHE THINKS I SHOULD'VE
ADVISED HER TO ABORT.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.000
WELL, SOME PARENTS
ARE NOT EQUIPPED

15:00.041 --> 15:01.625
TO CARE FOR
A LESS-THAN-PERFECT CHILD.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.041
I'VE READ LOTS OF BLOGS

15:03.083 --> 15:05.041
BY MOMS WHOSE BABIES
ARE LESS THAN PERFECT.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.208
THE MAJORITY BELIEVE THAT
PARENTING A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD

15:07.250 --> 15:08.875
IS--IS A BLESSING.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.166
ALL OF US ARE LESS THAN PERFECT.
PEOPLE JUST WANT GUARANTEES.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.375
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE
THE GENETIC SCREENING

15:12.417 --> 15:13.875
AND THE PRENATAL TESTING.

15:13.917 --> 15:15.500
(Cooper) THOSE TESTS ARE DONE
BEFORE BIRTH,

15:15.542 --> 15:17.041
AND SOMETIMES
EVEN BEFORE CONCEPTION.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.792
THIS CHILD IS 7 YEARS OLD?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.041
YOU KNOW,
NONE OF THIS IS NEW.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.208
I MEAN, THE ANCIENT ROMANS

15:21.250 --> 15:23.041
LEFT THEIR DISABLED KIDS OUT
FOR THE WOLVES TO EAT.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.667
OH.

15:24.709 --> 15:26.291
WHAT?
I SAID THE BLESSING THING.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.041
(Charlotte) WHO CARES
IF A KID CAN'T WALK?

15:28.083 --> 15:29.417
NEITHER CAN STEPHEN HAWKING
OR ITZHAK PERLMAN.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.417
NEVER STOPPED THEM
FROM BEING AN OVERACHIEVER.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.333
HOW DOES A MOTHER SAY
HER OWN CHILD'S LIFE

15:33.375 --> 15:35.041
IS NOT WORTH LIVING?

15:35.083 --> 15:36.417
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU SAY THAT
ABOUT ANY LIFE?

15:36.458 --> 15:38.333
IT WOULD BE ONE THING
IF I HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG

15:38.375 --> 15:39.917
OR MADE A MISTAKE,
BUT I DIDN'T.

15:39.959 --> 15:41.291
I HELPED HER.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.125
YOU DID.
YOU GAVE HER A CHILD.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.000
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT SHE
CAN'T HANDLE BEING A MOTHER.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.041
(baby-talk voice)
WEE! YEAH.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.041
YOU'RE HAVING A SWING,
AREN'T YOU?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.542
(laughs) WEE.

15:55.583 --> 15:57.166
(normal voice)
OH, HENRY.

15:57.208 --> 15:58.375
LOOK AT HIM SMILING.
(laughs)

15:58.417 --> 16:00.041
ADDISON.

16:00.083 --> 16:03.041
MY GOD.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.542
(indistinct conversations)

16:04.583 --> 16:06.000
HI.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.250
HI.

16:07.291 --> 16:09.917
UM, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
BUT I-I BROUGHT SOMEONE.

16:09.959 --> 16:12.291
ADDISON, JAKE, THIS IS DONNA.

16:12.333 --> 16:13.250
SHE'S MY, UM--

16:13.291 --> 16:14.750
I'M HENRY'S GRANDMOTHER.

16:21.834 --> 16:23.083
GOD, JUDI. HE LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE YOU.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.083
JUST EXACTLY LIKE YOU.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.291
IT'S LIKE GOING BACK
IN TIME. (laughs)

16:27.333 --> 16:29.041
I HOPE THIS IS OKAY.

16:29.083 --> 16:30.625
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE MENTIONED--

16:30.667 --> 16:31.792
(Jake) YOU DEFINITELY
SHOULD'VE MENTIONED--

16:31.834 --> 16:34.083
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.
I MEAN... I'M FINE.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.792
I'M JUST A LITTLE SURPRISED,
THAT'S ALL.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.333
SWEETIE,
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.792
BELIEVE ME, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE THE MOTHER

16:38.834 --> 16:40.542
WHO DIDN'T KNOW
HER KID WAS PREGNANT.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.041
WE DIDN'T TALK
FOR ALMOST A YEAR

16:42.083 --> 16:43.750
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LIKE
MY BOYFRIEND.

16:43.792 --> 16:45.083
THAT WASN'T WHY.
MOM.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.333
PLEASE.

16:46.375 --> 16:47.583
YOU TWO, YOU'RE ADULTS.

16:47.625 --> 16:50.125
YOU THINK A KID SHOULD
DISAPPEAR FROM HER MOM'S LIFE

16:50.166 --> 16:51.375
AND FAIL TO MENTION
SHE'D HAD A BABY

16:51.417 --> 16:52.625
BECAUSE OF A DISAGREEMENT?

16:52.667 --> 16:55.208
IT WAS MORE
THAN A DISAGREEMENT.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.417
(Henry coos)

16:57.458 --> 16:58.625
WOULD YOU MIND?

16:58.667 --> 17:00.500
COULD I HOLD MY GRANDSON?

17:08.875 --> 17:10.041
(babbles)
HI.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.667
(Jake) JUDI, IS THIS WHY
YOU WANTED TO SEE HENRY

17:11.709 --> 17:13.041
AFTER SUCH A LONG TIME,

17:13.083 --> 17:14.542
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
YOUR MOTHER TO MEET HIM?

17:14.583 --> 17:16.750
NO, NO.

17:16.792 --> 17:18.041
OR YES.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.166
I DON'T KNOW.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.166
LOOK, I WANTED TO SEE HIM.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.625
EVERY DAY,
I WANTED TO SEE HIM.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.041
BUT AFTER MOM AND I MADE UP
AND I TOLD HER,

17:26.083 --> 17:28.166
I GUESS HOW BAD SHE WANTED
TO SEE HIM

17:28.208 --> 17:30.333
GAVE ME THE COURAGE
TO CALL.

17:30.375 --> 17:33.041
I WISH
YOU COULD'VE COME TO ME.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.291
(voice breaks)
IF YOU HAD JUST TOLD ME...

17:41.458 --> 17:42.625
GIN.

17:42.667 --> 17:43.583
ARE YOU CHEATING?

17:43.625 --> 17:46.709
IN MY DAY, E.R. DOCS
WERE BETTER LOSERS.

17:46.750 --> 17:48.041
YOUR DEAL.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.500
YOU SAID BEST OF THREE,

17:49.542 --> 17:51.208
THEN WE COULD TALK ABOUT
YOUR TEST RESULTS.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.500
ANOTHER HAND.

17:53.542 --> 17:55.583
THE CANCER HAS SPREAD...

17:55.625 --> 17:57.709
TO YOUR LIVER.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.917
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT--
WE DON'T, ACTUALLY.

17:59.959 --> 18:02.667
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME
THE CANCER IS STAGE IV,

18:02.709 --> 18:05.041
WHICH MEANS
I SHOULD DIE SOON, RIGHT?

18:05.083 --> 18:06.792
YES.

18:06.834 --> 18:08.959
BUT I'VE BEEN A DOCTOR
LONGER THAN YOU'VE BEEN ALIVE.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.500
AND I KNOW SOMETIMES,
GREATER FORCES ARE AT WORK.

18:12.542 --> 18:14.500
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT FAITH?

18:14.542 --> 18:15.959
I'M SAYING,
I'M A CROTCHETY OLD BROAD

18:16.000 --> 18:18.041
AND I DON'T ACCEPT
YOUR DIAGNOSIS.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.834
I'M NOT EVEN
YOUR PATIENT ANYMORE.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.917
DON'T YOU HAVE TRAUMAS
TO DEAL WITH?

18:21.959 --> 18:24.500
IT'S MY DAY OFF, AND I'M
PARTIAL TO CROTCHETY OLD BROADS.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.542
THEN DEAL, AND LET'S
MAKE IT INTERESTING.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.291
A BUCK A POINT.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.458
DON'T DO IT.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.583
DO WHAT?

18:45.625 --> 18:46.542
YOU'RE GOING TO STARE
AT HENRY

18:46.583 --> 18:47.917
SO THAT HE CAN
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

18:47.959 --> 18:50.041
HE'S A BABY. BABIES NEED
TO BE CHECKED ON.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.667
HE'S A SLEEPING BABY,

18:51.709 --> 18:55.041
AND SLEEPING BABIES
NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.291
(sighs)

18:56.333 --> 18:59.125
ALL RIGHT. (groans)

18:59.166 --> 19:01.041
OKAY, SO WHICH THING IS IT?

19:01.083 --> 19:02.458
BECAUSE NO PERSON
IN YOUR SITUATION

19:02.500 --> 19:03.542
WOULD BE ABLE TO SLEEP
RIGHT NOW.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.083
DID YOU SEE HOW DONNA
WENT AFTER JUDI

19:05.125 --> 19:06.542
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US?

19:06.583 --> 19:09.333
AND THEN SHE--SHE REFERRED TO
HERSELF AS HENRY'S GRANDMOTHER.

19:09.375 --> 19:10.542
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT SHE CALLS HERSELF.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.041
YOU'RE HIS MOTHER.
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I AM.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.709
AND I WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR MY BOY.

19:13.750 --> 19:14.959
I'D WALK THROUGH FIRE.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.166
I WOULD GIVE UP ALL MY LIMBS--
EVERY LIMB.

19:18.208 --> 19:21.166
AND WHY,
WHY THE HELL DIDN'T...

19:21.208 --> 19:23.917
I STAY IN BETTER TOUCH
WITH VIVIAN?

19:23.959 --> 19:25.542
IT WOULDN'T CHANGE
HER DIAGNOSIS.

19:25.583 --> 19:26.792
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.625
WAIT. YOU CAN CURE CANCER?
THAT--THAT'S AWESOME.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.583
OH, SHUT UP.
EVERYONE JUST WANTS ME TO BE--

19:30.625 --> 19:32.709
WHY...

19:32.750 --> 19:34.750
IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?

19:34.792 --> 19:37.291
I MEAN, WHY IS ALL OF THIS
HAPPENING TO ME?

19:37.333 --> 19:40.041
MY--MY LAWYER SAYS THAT
WE CAN'T WIN IN COURT

19:40.083 --> 19:41.542
SO I SHOULD GO INTO MEDIATION

19:41.583 --> 19:42.750
AND ACT CONTRITE
SO WE CAN SETTLE.

19:42.792 --> 19:44.542
SHE CAN'T EVEN SPEAK
IN MEDIATION.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.000
NOT THAT SHE WOULD GET
A WORD IN EDGEWISE.

19:46.041 --> 19:47.625
OKAY, BUT NO, I JUST--

19:47.667 --> 19:48.875
IT'S TOO MUCH, JAKE. OKAY?

19:48.917 --> 19:50.583
I CAN'T LOSE MY SON
AND I CAN'T HAVE VIVIAN DIE

19:50.625 --> 19:52.792
AND I CANNOT SETTLE
FOR MILLIONS

19:52.834 --> 19:55.000
WHEN I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.000
YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR SON,

19:57.041 --> 19:58.750
VIVIAN WILL DIE SOMEDAY--
WE ALL WILL--

19:58.792 --> 20:01.041
AND YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.625
BUT AS DOCTORS, WE HAVE
A TENDENCY TO GO IN FIGHTING,

20:03.667 --> 20:06.417
AND IF WE JUST OPENED OURSELVES
UP TO HEARING THE OTHER SIDE,

20:06.458 --> 20:08.417
THEN THE--THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
IN LAWSUITS,

20:08.458 --> 20:10.417
THE LEVEL OF HOSTILITY,
IT--IT MIGHT ALL CHANGE.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.750
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

20:12.792 --> 20:14.667
NO, YOU DIDN'T,
BUT REGARDLESS,

20:14.709 --> 20:16.583
IF THERE WERE A WAY
TO MAKE GWEN'S LIFE EASIER,

20:16.625 --> 20:19.041
WOULDN'T YOU DO IT?

20:19.083 --> 20:21.417
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT JUST
A DOCTOR, ADDISON.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.458
YOU'RE A MOTHER, A MOTHER
WHO WOULD WALK THROUGH FIRE

20:23.500 --> 20:25.917
AND GIVE UP HER LIMBS.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.834
BUT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,
SO IS SEAN.

20:33.417 --> 20:34.625
YOU LOST?

20:34.667 --> 20:35.792
E.R.'s ON THE FIRST FLOOR.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.625
ACTUALLY,
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.041
I HAVE
A 74-YEAR-OLD PATIENT,

20:39.083 --> 20:40.834
STAGE IV GASTRIC CANCER.

20:40.875 --> 20:43.250
SHE'S BEEN ON FENTANYL,
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.083
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
SPINAL CORD STIMULATION

20:45.125 --> 20:46.583
OR INTRATHECAL PAIN PUMPS?

20:46.625 --> 20:48.625
I THINK THEY'RE BOTH TERRIFIC
OPTIONS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT.

20:48.667 --> 20:49.583
GREAT. WELL--

20:49.625 --> 20:51.041
BUT NOT FOR
A 74-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

20:51.083 --> 20:52.834
WITH STAGE IV GASTRIC CANCER.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.583
SURGICALLY IMPLANTING
A DEVICE AT THIS POINT,

20:54.625 --> 20:56.041
IT'S TOO INVASIVE.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.667
SHE MIGHT NOT SURVIVE
THE PROCEDURE.

20:57.709 --> 21:01.750
YEAH, I FIGURED
IT WAS A LONG SHOT.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.208
THIS A RELATIVE OF YOURS?

21:03.250 --> 21:04.750
NEVER MET HER
BEFORE YESTERDAY,

21:04.792 --> 21:06.500
BUT SHE'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE PATIENTS.

21:06.542 --> 21:07.875
I DON'T KNOW.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.250
I JUST WANTED TO HELP.
ANYWAY, THANKS.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.458
(knock on door)

21:22.083 --> 21:23.709
HOW LONG DOES SHE HAVE?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.333
COULD BE HOURS.
COULD BE WEEKS.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.542
MAYBE A MONTH.
NOT MORE.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.583
BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE
AN ADVANCED DIRECTIVE,

21:29.625 --> 21:31.375
WON'T CONSIDER HOSPICE.

21:31.417 --> 21:32.875
YOU KNOW HER, SO I FIGURED

21:32.917 --> 21:35.709
MAYBE YOU COULD GET HER
TO STOP BEING SO STUBBORN.

21:35.750 --> 21:36.959
(knock on door)

21:37.000 --> 21:38.709
(Judi) SORRY.

21:38.750 --> 21:41.291
UM... I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU

21:41.333 --> 21:42.792
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.792
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER.

21:44.834 --> 21:47.041
JAMES.

21:47.083 --> 21:48.750
THANKS.

22:00.583 --> 22:02.625
IT IS NOT ALL RIGHT.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.041
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
WHAT?

22:04.083 --> 22:05.709
YOU CAN'T SHOW UP
AT MY WORK.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.000
YOU CANNOT AMBUSH ME
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.333
YOU ARE NOT A CHILD.
YOU MADE A CHOICE.

22:10.375 --> 22:14.333
AND I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL,
BUT YOU HAVE TO STOP NOW.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.625
STOP AMBUSHING ME

22:16.667 --> 22:17.834
OR I WILL DISAPPEAR.

22:17.875 --> 22:20.041
I WILL PACK UP HENRY,
AND I WILL MOVE,

22:20.083 --> 22:21.333
AND I SWEAR TO GOD,

22:21.375 --> 22:24.792
YOU WILL NEVER EVEN SEE
A PICTURE OF MY SON.

22:26.542 --> 22:27.709
I'M SORRY.

22:27.750 --> 22:29.375
I'M REALLY SORRY. I D--

22:29.417 --> 22:31.709
I DIDN'T REALIZE...

22:31.750 --> 22:33.750
I WAS JUST
COMING HERE TO SAY

22:33.792 --> 22:37.041
THAT I CAN'T
SEE HENRY ANYMORE.

22:37.083 --> 22:40.417
IT'S TOO HARD
AND IT HURTS TOO MUCH.

22:40.458 --> 22:41.834
SO...

22:41.875 --> 22:44.417
I JUST--
I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU.

22:44.458 --> 22:45.667
YOU'RE A GREAT MOM.

22:45.709 --> 22:48.041
YOU'RE A GREAT PERSON.

22:48.083 --> 22:51.458
AND... (voice breaking)
AND I'M SORRY.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.041
I WON'T BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

23:00.875 --> 23:02.667
(sighs)

23:06.417 --> 23:07.625
MY JOB AS MEDIATOR IS
TO FACILITATE A CONVERSATION

23:07.667 --> 23:08.875
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

23:08.917 --> 23:10.458
I'LL START WITH QUESTIONS,
OKAY?

23:10.500 --> 23:13.041
ADDISON, HOW MANY IN UTERO
SPINA BIFIDA SURGERIES

23:13.083 --> 23:14.458
DO YOU DO IN A YEAR?

23:14.500 --> 23:17.375
A HANDFUL.
FIVE, SOMETIMES MORE.

23:17.417 --> 23:20.000
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO SEAN WHY YOU
BELIEVED, WITH YOUR TREATMENT,

23:20.041 --> 23:22.041
GWEN WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK.

23:22.083 --> 23:26.041
BY REPAIRING THE SPINAL COLUMN
WHILE THE FETUS IS GESTATING,

23:26.083 --> 23:28.041
YOU INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD
OF MUSCLE TONE DEVELOPING

23:28.083 --> 23:29.792
IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.

23:29.834 --> 23:31.041
AND JUDGING BY GWEN'S CHART,

23:31.083 --> 23:33.041
IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S STARTING TO WALK.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.166
SHE HOISTS HERSELF UP
OUT OF HER WHEELCHAIR

23:35.208 --> 23:36.834
WITH HER ARMS,

23:36.875 --> 23:38.041
HOVERS FOR FIVE MINUTES,

23:38.083 --> 23:40.375
AND FALLS BACK
INTO HER CHAIR EXHAUSTED.

23:40.417 --> 23:43.041
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
BUT IT'S NOT WALKING.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.041
SEAN, BY SUING ADDISON

23:44.083 --> 23:45.417
FOR THE WRONGFUL BIRTH OF
YOUR CHILD,

23:45.458 --> 23:47.041
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
IF YOU HAD UNDERSTOOD

23:47.083 --> 23:50.291
GWEN WOULD NEVER BE
COMPLETELY AMBULATORY,

23:50.333 --> 23:52.041
YOU WOULD HAVE TERMINATED
YOUR PREGNANCY.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.917
IS THAT CORRECT?

23:53.959 --> 23:55.875
IT'S NOT JUST THE WALKING.

23:55.917 --> 23:58.041
GWEN WILL NEVER HAVE
A NORMAL LIFE

23:58.083 --> 23:59.458
BECAUSE YOU LIED TO ME.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.041
I DID MY JOB.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.208
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THE WAY
YOUR LIFE TURNED OUT,

24:02.250 --> 24:03.041
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME.

24:03.083 --> 24:05.041
YOU ARE TO BLAME.

24:05.083 --> 24:07.500
YOU DIDN'T PREPARE US
FOR THIS REALITY.

24:07.542 --> 24:09.041
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T PREPARE US

24:09.083 --> 24:11.041
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND LEFT
BEFORE GWEN WAS 2.

24:11.083 --> 24:14.500
HE WASN'T PREPARED.
I WASN'T PREPARED.

24:14.542 --> 24:17.125
AND NOW I HAVE SPENT
EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE

24:17.166 --> 24:19.166
SINCE GWEN WAS BORN
CARING FOR HER,

24:19.208 --> 24:22.000
FEEDING HER, CLOTHING HER,
WIPING HER.

24:22.041 --> 24:25.041
AND I WILL SPEND EVERY DAY
OF MY LIFE DOING THAT

24:25.083 --> 24:27.041
UNTIL I DIE OR SHE DIES.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.500
YOU BEGGED ME TO SAVE
YOUR DAUGHTER, AND I DID.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.041
TAKING CARE OF YOUR CHILD,

24:31.083 --> 24:33.291
DEALING WITH PAIN
AND DISAPPOINTMENT,

24:33.333 --> 24:35.500
BEING AFRAID EVERY SECOND,
EVERY DAY--

24:35.542 --> 24:37.041
THAT IS MOTHERHOOD.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.041
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS MY JOB
TO EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU,

24:39.083 --> 24:40.959
BUT CLEARLY,
YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE,

24:41.041 --> 24:42.458
BECAUSE NO MOTHER
COULD COME HERE AND DO THIS.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.959
NO MOTHER COULD EVER SAY THAT
HER CHILD SHOULDN'T EXIST.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.750
YOU WILL NOT
CALL ME A BAD MOTHER.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.291
YOU WILL NOT
MAKE ME INTO A VILLAIN

24:50.333 --> 24:52.542
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO IS HEARTLESS.

24:52.583 --> 24:55.041
AND WHEN I TAKE YOUR ASS
TO COURT,

24:55.083 --> 24:57.792
THE JURY WILL AGREE.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.792
YOU'RE A DEAR.

25:12.834 --> 25:14.083
HOW'S YOUR PAIN LEVEL
TODAY?

25:14.125 --> 25:16.125
HOW WAS MEDIATION?

25:16.166 --> 25:17.917
(clears throat)
YOU'RE DEFLECTING.

25:17.959 --> 25:19.041
IN FACT, I AM.

25:19.083 --> 25:24.041
WELL, I ATTEMPTED TO
PLAY NICE AND HOLD MY TONGUE,

25:24.083 --> 25:25.625
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
I DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE,

25:25.667 --> 25:27.041
AND THE WOMAN WHO'S SUING ME
IS A BITCH,

25:27.083 --> 25:28.458
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE
LISTENING TO HER

25:28.500 --> 25:30.000
COMPLAIN ABOUT
HER LIFE ANYMORE.

25:30.041 --> 25:32.792
WHY IS IT NOWADAYS
EVERYONE THINKS

25:32.834 --> 25:35.834
PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THEIR EMOTIONS?

25:35.875 --> 25:37.041
(chuckles)

25:37.083 --> 25:39.041
EVERYONE HAS SO MANY FEELINGS.
IT'S ABSURD.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.834
(laughs) AW.

25:40.875 --> 25:43.041
I'VE WORKED MY WHOLE LIFE
TO BECOME A GREAT DOCTOR,

25:43.083 --> 25:45.000
AND NOW MY REPUTATION'S
BEING THREATENED.

25:45.041 --> 25:46.375
AND WHAT'S EVEN WORSE,

25:46.417 --> 25:48.375
THERE'S ONLY A FEW PEOPLE
WHO DO WHAT I DO.

25:48.417 --> 25:50.041
SO IF I CAN'T
PRACTICE MEDICINE,

25:50.083 --> 25:52.375
THERE WILL
LITERALLY BE BABIES...

25:52.417 --> 25:54.625
THAT WON'T GET SAVED.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.667
I KNOW
THAT SOUNDS EGOTISTICAL--

25:56.709 --> 26:00.041
OH, DON'T YOU EVER BACKPEDAL
YOUR EGO WITH ME, MISSY.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.333
YOU'RE MY STUDENT.

26:01.375 --> 26:04.875
YOU DESERVE EVERY BIT
OF THAT PRIDE.

26:04.917 --> 26:07.000
(sighs) VIVIAN...

26:09.834 --> 26:13.417
IT'S TIME TO PUT
YOUR AFFAIRS IN ORDER.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.166
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

26:15.208 --> 26:17.041
DID JUDI END UP
COMING BACK?

26:17.083 --> 26:19.417
YOU'RE DEFLECTING AGAIN.

26:20.834 --> 26:22.709
YES, SHE DID, AND SHE BROUGHT
A SURPRISE GUEST--

26:22.750 --> 26:24.709
HER MOTHER.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.041
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
UNCOMFORTABLE.

26:26.083 --> 26:29.041
(chuckles) I THINK
IT WAS HARDER FOR JUDI.

26:29.083 --> 26:33.083
I DON'T THINK HER MOTHER
APPROVES OF HER GIVING HENRY UP.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.125
MOTHERS TRY TO PROTECT
THEIR CHILDREN.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.250
BUT SOMETIMES IN THE PROCESS,

26:37.291 --> 26:40.041
THEY DO A LOT OF DAMAGE.

26:40.083 --> 26:42.375
WHAT DID YOUR MOTHER DO?

26:44.125 --> 26:46.083
BEFORE YOU LEAVE
THE MATERNITY HOME,

26:46.125 --> 26:51.041
THEY LET YOU HOLD YOUR BABY
FOR 30 MINUTES TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

26:51.083 --> 26:54.041
EVERYTHING I'D KNOW
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER,

26:54.083 --> 26:56.041
EVERYTHING SHE'D KNOW
ABOUT ME...

26:56.083 --> 26:58.667
WOULD COME
IN THAT 30 MINUTES.

26:58.709 --> 27:00.208
I PRACTICED
WHAT I'D SAY TO HER

27:00.250 --> 27:04.041
WHILE I CROCHETED
A PAIR OF BABY BOOTIES.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.250
BUT... BEFORE
THEY BROUGHT HER IN,

27:07.291 --> 27:11.750
MY MOTHER SHOWED UP
TO TAKE ME HOME.

27:11.792 --> 27:16.041
AND WHEN SISTER JO
BROUGHT MY BABY...

27:16.083 --> 27:18.750
MY MOTHER
SENT THEM BOTH AWAY.

27:21.083 --> 27:25.041
(voice breaking)
I WANTED TO HOLD MY BABY.

27:25.083 --> 27:27.542
I WANTED TO BE HER MOTHER.

27:27.583 --> 27:29.709
(sniffles)
BUT WHAT KIND OF LIFE

27:29.750 --> 27:32.959
WOULD I HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO GIVE HER ANYWAY?

27:34.083 --> 27:36.041
MEDICINE...

27:36.083 --> 27:38.959
THAT BECAME MY LIFE'S WORK,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.041
AND LOOKING AFTER
A FEW SPECIAL STUDENTS,

27:42.083 --> 27:43.417
LIKE YOU.

27:43.458 --> 27:45.417
(exhales)

27:45.458 --> 27:48.041
DID YOU EVER FORGIVE
YOUR MOTHER?

27:48.083 --> 27:50.417
SHE DID WHAT SHE THOUGHT
WAS BEST FOR ME.

27:50.458 --> 27:53.125
THE TRUTH IS,
I HAD TO THANK HER.

27:53.166 --> 27:56.041
I WAS THE ONLY FEMALE SURGEON
IN MY CLASS.

27:56.083 --> 27:59.083
THE MALE RESIDENTS
JUST TORTURED ME.

27:59.125 --> 28:00.417
(chuckles)

28:00.458 --> 28:03.041
BUT IT ROLLED OFF
MY BACK.

28:03.083 --> 28:06.041
AFTER YOUR MOTHER
CALLS YOU A WHORE,

28:06.083 --> 28:08.041
NOTHING ELSE HURTS.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.834
OH, WHERE DID YOU FIND...

28:10.875 --> 28:12.041
THE STRENGTH?

28:12.083 --> 28:14.834
WE'RE WOMEN, HONEY.

28:14.875 --> 28:17.041
THE STRENGTH FINDS US.

28:17.083 --> 28:19.000
(sighs)

28:26.667 --> 28:28.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:28.083 --> 28:29.125
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

28:29.166 --> 28:32.041
I AM DONE TALKING TO YOU.

28:34.917 --> 28:37.041
SHE'S A FIGHTER.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.041
(sighs)

28:38.083 --> 28:40.000
SHE'S BEEN WORKING ON
TAKING HER FIRST STEP

28:40.041 --> 28:41.333
FOR OVER A YEAR.

28:41.375 --> 28:44.041
SEAN, THERE'S NO WAY
YOU WOULD'VE TERMINATED.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.417
I WENT BACK
AND LOOKED AT YOUR CHART.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.917
YOU'D BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS.

28:47.959 --> 28:49.375
THREE ROUNDS OF I.V.F.
WITH NO LUCK

28:49.417 --> 28:51.083
UNTIL YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
QUIT TRYING,

28:51.125 --> 28:52.291
AND THEN
THE MIRACLE HAPPENED.

28:52.333 --> 28:53.709
YOU GOT PREGNANT.

28:53.750 --> 28:57.000
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU WOULD'VE HAD AN ABORTION.

28:57.041 --> 28:58.041
DO YOU HAVE KIDS?
YES.

28:58.083 --> 28:59.250
DO THEY HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS?

28:59.291 --> 29:00.875
NO, BUT--

29:00.917 --> 29:02.041
YOU'RE A WEALTHY DOCTOR
WITH A PERFECT CHILD.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.625
YOU DON'T GET TO JUDGE ME.

29:03.667 --> 29:05.041
BUT YOU ARE JUDGING ME.

29:05.083 --> 29:06.083
YOU'RE PUTTING MY LIFE
ON TRIAL.

29:06.125 --> 29:08.667
YOU'RE TRYING TO
TAKE ME DOWN FOR MONEY

29:08.709 --> 29:10.291
WHEN YOU KNOW
I DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE.

29:10.333 --> 29:12.041
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

29:12.083 --> 29:14.041
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.875
I GOT LAID OFF.

29:15.917 --> 29:18.709
THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WORK
CUT THE SOCIAL WORKER STAFF,

29:18.750 --> 29:20.709
AND I GOT LAID OFF.

29:20.750 --> 29:23.041
SOMETHING HAS GOTTA GIVE FOR ME
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET,

29:23.083 --> 29:25.125
AND IT CANNOT BE
HER MEDICAL CARE

29:25.166 --> 29:27.041
OR RENT OR FOOD.

29:27.083 --> 29:29.041
(sighs)

29:29.083 --> 29:30.667
LOOK AT HER.

29:30.709 --> 29:32.709
SHE'S AMAZING.

29:32.750 --> 29:35.917
AND OF COURSE I DON'T
REGRET HAVING HER.

29:35.959 --> 29:38.542
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

29:40.542 --> 29:43.041
SOMEDAY GWEN'S GONNA FIND OUT
WHERE THAT MONEY CAME FROM,

29:43.083 --> 29:44.917
AND IT WILL DESTROY HER.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.500
LOOK, MOMMY. LOOK!

29:47.542 --> 29:49.041
I'M WALKING, MOMMY.

29:49.083 --> 29:51.542
YOU ARE, BABY!
YOU ARE.

29:51.583 --> 29:55.041
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

29:55.083 --> 29:58.041
(chuckles)

30:01.083 --> 30:02.291
(sighs)

30:02.333 --> 30:03.542
OH, MY GOD.
THAT IS BETTER THAN SEX.

30:03.583 --> 30:06.000
OKAY, I'M GONNA PRETEND
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.

30:06.041 --> 30:07.542
(Mason) OKAY.

30:07.583 --> 30:08.500
I FIGURED IT OUT.

30:08.542 --> 30:10.250
REMEMBER THAT TIME
WE WENT SAILING

30:10.291 --> 30:11.750
AND YOU DIDN'T GET SEASICK?

30:11.792 --> 30:12.959
MM-HMM.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.333
AND ON THE BEACH,
FOUND THIS ROSE QUARTZ?

30:14.375 --> 30:15.500
MM-HMM.

30:15.542 --> 30:16.917
IT'S BASICALLY TREASURE.

30:16.959 --> 30:20.041
YOUR PARENTS ARE PIRATES.

30:20.083 --> 30:21.125
JEWISH PIRATES?

30:21.166 --> 30:22.583
MAYBE NOT EVEN JEWISH.

30:22.625 --> 30:25.041
I WAS ADOPTED THROUGH
A JEWISH AGENCY.

30:25.083 --> 30:26.542
I'M JEWISH.

30:26.583 --> 30:27.500
BUT IF WE FOUND
YOUR REAL PARENTS,

30:27.542 --> 30:29.041
WE COULD VACATIONING
ON THEIR--

30:29.083 --> 30:30.583
OKAY, I GR--I GREW UP
WITH MY REAL PARENTS.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.542
I THINK WHAT YOU MEANT
IS THEY'RE MY BIOLOGICAL--
YOU HAVE MORE.

30:32.583 --> 30:34.750
I MEAN, HOW COULD YOU
NOT WANT TO MEET THEM?

30:34.792 --> 30:36.750
OKAY, MASON. (sighs)

30:36.792 --> 30:40.375
SOME QUESTIONS, EVEN WHEN THEY
COME FROM JUST BEING CURIOUS,

30:40.417 --> 30:41.917
THEY CAN BE HURTFUL.

30:41.959 --> 30:44.000
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT
THE PERSON YOU'RE ASKING

30:44.041 --> 30:46.083
AND HOW IT MIGHT
AFFECT 'EM.

30:46.125 --> 30:48.959
I'M SORRY, DAD.
I WASN'T TRYING TO BE MEAN.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.417
I KNOW, SWEETIE.

30:50.458 --> 30:52.500
IT'S JUST, ALL THOSE YEARS
I SPENT WITH MOM

30:52.542 --> 30:53.959
AND NOBODY ELSE.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.959
I WONDERED ABOUT YOU.

30:57.041 --> 31:00.041
I GET THAT. I DO.

31:00.083 --> 31:02.333
AND IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T
WONDERED ABOUT MY BIRTH MOTHER.

31:02.375 --> 31:03.583
OF COURSE I HAVE.

31:03.625 --> 31:05.583
I EVEN MADE UP
A LIFE FOR HER, TOO.

31:05.625 --> 31:07.250
SHE'S HAPPILY MARRIED,
SHE'S GOT THREE KIDS,

31:07.291 --> 31:10.250
SHE TEACHES THIRD GRADE
IN A SUBURB OF DAYTON.

31:10.291 --> 31:13.208
LOOK, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO WERE ADOPTED

31:13.250 --> 31:14.667
WHO WANT TO FIND
THEIR BIOLOGICAL PARENTS.

31:14.709 --> 31:16.208
IT JUST...

31:16.250 --> 31:18.417
IT WAS NEVER ME.

31:18.458 --> 31:20.750
TO ME, MY PARENTS ARE THE ONES
WHO CHECKED MY HOMEWORK

31:20.792 --> 31:22.250
AND STAYED UP WITH ME
WHEN I WAS SICK

31:22.291 --> 31:23.750
AND MADE ME FEEL LIKE

31:23.792 --> 31:26.375
I WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN THE WORLD TO THEM.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.041
THEY'RE MY FAMILY,

31:28.083 --> 31:30.000
LIKE CHARLOTTE
IS FAMILY TO YOU.

31:30.041 --> 31:33.250
BLOOD DOESN'T MAKE A FAMILY.
LOVE DOES.

31:34.917 --> 31:37.375
THAT MAKES SENSE.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.166
BUT CAN WE STILL
GET THE TRIPLETS

31:39.208 --> 31:41.667
THEIR OWN PIRATE HATS?

31:47.083 --> 31:50.625
VITALS AREN'T SO GOOD,
ARE THEY?

31:50.667 --> 31:51.834
THEY'RE FINE.

31:51.875 --> 31:54.041
YOU NEED TO BECOME
A BETTER LIAR.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.500
(Velcro rips)

31:55.542 --> 31:57.041
DO YOU HAVE A WIFE?

31:57.083 --> 31:58.583
I HAVEN'T FOUND
THE LUCKY GIRL YET.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.500
IF ONLY I WERE
40 YEARS YOUNGER.

32:01.542 --> 32:03.625
I WAS A REAL BEAUTY
BACK THEN.

32:03.667 --> 32:04.542
YOU STILL ARE.

32:04.583 --> 32:06.417
NO FLIRTING
WITH THE PATIENTS.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.250
DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

32:08.291 --> 32:09.750
I'M NOT EASILY DISCOURAGED.

32:09.792 --> 32:12.000
I'LL CHECK ON YOU LATER,
OKAY?

32:13.667 --> 32:15.417
DID YOU FIND THE STATIONERY?

32:15.458 --> 32:17.041
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

32:17.083 --> 32:20.083
I NEED YOU
TO WRITE ME A LETTER.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.250
OKAY.

32:22.291 --> 32:23.834

32:23.875 --> 32:25.959

I WAS ALWAYS THERE WITH YOU.

YOU HAD TWO.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.083
WILL YOU DO IT FOR ME?

35:06.667 --> 35:07.834
YES.

UM...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

35:41.500 --> 35:43.917
I'M NOT REALLY SURE,
EXACTLY.

35:43.959 --> 35:46.041
I READ, UH,
WHEN YOU ADOPT A BABY,

35:46.083 --> 35:48.959
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE
THE BIRTH MOTHER SOMETHING.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.458
NOT... THAT I COULD EVER

35:51.500 --> 35:53.917

I GOT YOU THIS.

36:07.625 --> 36:10.375
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN...
DO YOU EVEN LIKE GOLD?

36:10.417 --> 36:12.041
UH, SHOULD I HAVE
GOTTEN YOU SILVER?

36:12.083 --> 36:14.041
NO. I LIKE IT.

36:14.083 --> 36:17.291
I-I DO.

36:17.333 --> 36:20.041
PLEASE DON'T STOP
SEEING HENRY.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.834
(sighs) HENRY SHOULDN'T BE
AROUND ME.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.208
WHEN HE'S OLD ENOUGH
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I DID,

36:25.250 --> 36:26.500
HE'LL HATE ME.

36:26.542 --> 36:27.709
NO, HE WON'T.
HE COULDN'T.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.583
WHAT YOU DID WAS PUT
HIS WELFARE ABOVE YOUR OWN,

36:29.625 --> 36:31.959
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT A MOTHER DOES.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.834
I'M NOT HIS MOTHER.
YOU ARE.

36:33.875 --> 36:35.375
NO, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY.

36:35.417 --> 36:37.458
WE BOTH ARE.

36:37.500 --> 36:40.458
YOU, HENRY, AND I,
WE'RE CONNECTED NOW.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.041
WE'RE FAMILY.

36:42.083 --> 36:44.041
AND I GET THAT IT'S HARD,

36:44.083 --> 36:45.542
AND IF YOU NEED A BREAK,
THAT'S OKAY.

36:45.583 --> 36:46.750
OR IF IT'S JUST TOO MUCH,
THAT'S OKAY.

36:46.792 --> 36:48.125
BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW,

36:48.166 --> 36:49.458
YOU HAVE TO KNOW,

36:49.500 --> 36:53.458
THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE WELCOME IN HIS HOME,

36:53.500 --> 36:55.125
IN OUR HOME.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.000
(sighs)

36:59.417 --> 37:01.250
UM...

37:01.291 --> 37:03.417
MY BREAK
IS IN TEN MINUTES...

37:03.458 --> 37:07.250
AND THE BLUEBERRY PIE HERE
IS REALLY GOOD.

37:07.291 --> 37:10.041
MAYBE IF YOU ORDERED
TWO PIECES, WE COULD--

37:10.083 --> 37:12.583
I'D LOVE THAT.

I'M GLAD YOU BOTH
RECONSIDERED MEDIATION.

I THINK IF YOU TRY TO TRULY
LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER--

37:23.083 --> 37:25.041
I WANT TO SETTLE.

37:25.083 --> 37:26.166
WHAT?

37:26.208 --> 37:27.291
LET'S STOP ALL THIS.

37:27.333 --> 37:29.041
PICK A NUMBER,
AND I'LL PAY IT.

37:29.083 --> 37:30.000
BUT WHY WOULD YOU--

37:30.041 --> 37:31.583
GWEN NEEDS TO BE
TAKEN CARE OF.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.208
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH--
I CAN'T CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED,

37:33.250 --> 37:34.917
BUT I CAN HELP.

37:34.959 --> 37:36.667
LET ME HELP.

37:36.709 --> 37:38.041
I CAN'T.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.834
NO, IT'S OKAY.
TALK TO YOUR LAWYER,

37:39.875 --> 37:41.041
AND I'LL MAKE IT WORK.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.834
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:42.875 --> 37:44.959
(sighs)

37:45.000 --> 37:46.917
YOU WERE RIGHT.

37:48.083 --> 37:49.333
(sighs)

37:49.375 --> 37:51.834
GWEN CAN NEVER THINK
I DIDN'T WANT HER.

37:51.875 --> 37:53.834
AND IF GO TH--

37:53.875 --> 37:55.542
(sighs)

37:57.583 --> 38:00.041
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

38:00.083 --> 38:03.041
I CAN'T TAKE YOUR MONEY.

38:08.375 --> 38:11.000
(exhales)

38:21.083 --> 38:24.041
(sighs) WHEN?

38:24.083 --> 38:25.333
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

38:25.375 --> 38:27.333
I TEXTED YOU.

38:30.834 --> 38:34.375
I WAS IN MEDIATION.

38:34.417 --> 38:36.208
I'M SORRY, ADDISON.

38:38.041 --> 38:40.250
THANK YOU.

38:40.291 --> 38:42.500
SHE HAD THAT LIGHT
INSIDE OF HER THAT...

38:42.542 --> 38:44.542
MADE YOU WANT TO CATCH
EVERY WORD SHE SAID.

38:44.583 --> 38:45.792
(sighs)

38:45.834 --> 38:47.000
MY GRANDMOTHER HAD THAT.

38:47.041 --> 38:48.625
SHE USED TO WAKE UP
EVERY MORNING

38:48.667 --> 38:51.917
AND WAVE UP AT THE SKY
AND SAY GOOD MORNING TO THE SUN,

38:51.959 --> 38:54.542
FED THE RABBITS TABLE SCRAPS.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.250
SHE DIED OF CANCER, TOO.

39:01.291 --> 39:02.959
I WISH I'D GOTTEN TO SPEND

39:03.000 --> 39:05.625
MORE TIME WITH MY GRANDMOTHER
WHEN SHE WAS DYING.

39:05.667 --> 39:07.041
