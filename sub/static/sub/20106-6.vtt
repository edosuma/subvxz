in the hole and seals it up.

Yeah, that prick Archer said

10:30.362 --> 10:32.411
one of 'em owed a bunch
of money to len Trexler.

10:32.469 --> 10:34.270
Well, then, that's
where we're going.

10:34.403 --> 10:35.887
We're commandeering
this vehicle.

10:35.952 --> 10:38.887
Can obvious prostitutes do that?

10:38.982 --> 10:42.059
I'm not an obvious prostitute!
She's a T-man, ya dummy.

10:42.139 --> 10:45.114
Wow! I would not
have guessed that.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.743
Not a Transvestite,
a Treasury Agent!

10:48.793 --> 10:51.551
And quit blabbing that around.
Bel-air road.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.481
Go!
Yes, sir!

10:53.595 --> 10:57.270
"Ma'am"! Sorry! However
you self-identify!

10:59.036 --> 11:01.090
Ugh!
Will you calm down?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.739
I just wanna get some hot water!

11:02.792 --> 11:05.778
Well, you'll be <i> in</i> hot water
if you try to sneak off

11:05.898 --> 11:08.098
before Archer comes back
with that ransom money.

11:08.165 --> 11:10.225
I heard you! Tsk!

11:10.336 --> 11:12.270
You make being
kidnapped just awful.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.020
There's a reason they
say "kidnapping victim"

11:15.107 --> 11:17.114
and not "kidnapping winner."

11:17.192 --> 11:18.512
Krieger: What's that? -

11:19.840 --> 11:22.441
Don't you have a house to haunt?

11:22.512 --> 11:23.629
No.

11:23.711 --> 11:25.637
And what is that?
What do you have?

11:25.697 --> 11:27.137
Um...

11:28.749 --> 11:30.786
Nothing.

11:34.348 --> 11:35.676
I think it was something.

11:35.739 --> 11:38.479
Boy, you don't miss a trick.

11:39.916 --> 11:44.386
We'll see how funny you are
hopping around on one foot.

11:47.246 --> 11:49.214
That actually does sound funny.

11:50.262 --> 11:52.989
And wait. Weren't you
wearing a Polo uniform?

11:53.147 --> 11:55.717
- Did you go home and change?
- I did, yes.

11:55.778 --> 11:58.598
In all the excitement of the
ransom drop, I evacuated.

11:58.682 --> 12:00.332
Yeah, well, I would've
hightailed it too.

12:00.444 --> 12:02.575
No, no, no, no.
Common misconception.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.155
When a person evacuates,

12:04.207 --> 12:06.590
it means they empty
their bladder and bowels.

12:06.651 --> 12:09.582
- Ew! Well, I'm sorry.
- I didn't invent Latin.

12:09.767 --> 12:12.325
- Oh. Ooh. So what do you call this?
- No.

12:12.474 --> 12:14.418
- What, the potato compart...
- No.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.629
- Spud box?
- No!

12:16.869 --> 12:18.614
- Tater hutch.
- Rrrrrgh!

12:18.751 --> 12:20.325
I knew we'd
get there eventually.

12:20.385 --> 12:23.054
Can we eventually
get to Trexler's?

12:23.142 --> 12:24.856
I mean, presumably.

12:24.916 --> 12:27.146
Ugh! I swear to God...

12:27.434 --> 12:29.059
Poovey, if you don't shut up...

12:29.114 --> 12:31.450
No, you shut up!
Come on! Wait!

12:31.553 --> 12:33.231
It's not too late to turn back.

12:33.314 --> 12:34.661
Yes. It is.

12:34.725 --> 12:36.725
And why the hell are you
so desperate for money?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.332
Because you know how
much it's gonna cost

12:38.356 --> 12:40.325
to send a kid to Stanford in
1967?

12:40.374 --> 12:41.480
I know if you don't shut up,

12:41.504 --> 12:42.519
you won't have to
worry about it,

12:42.544 --> 12:45.972
because I'm gonna shoot you
in the... genitals!

12:46.559 --> 12:48.403
Huh. Now, why would
the door be open?

12:48.481 --> 12:50.004
Maybe he's got a selfish partner

12:50.082 --> 12:51.786
who left the door
open on purpose

12:51.864 --> 12:54.145
so his new puppy
could get run over by a car.

12:54.246 --> 12:57.019
Oh, and the puppy's name
is dreams!

12:57.551 --> 12:59.153
Oh, go ahead.

12:59.233 --> 13:00.433
Blow it off!

13:01.046 --> 13:02.950
Something's
not right, you idiot.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.078
Oh.

13:06.762 --> 13:08.911
Cecil:
So, trinette, as a prostitute,

13:08.993 --> 13:11.176
how do you feel
about role-playing...

13:11.201 --> 13:13.341
- Whatever fluffs your feathers.
- Please let me finish.

13:13.366 --> 13:15.256
Where the story
revolves around Merkins,

13:15.394 --> 13:17.575
mistaken identities, and incest.

13:17.729 --> 13:19.645
Ew! And it's a musical.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.864
No, you lumpy little pervert!

13:22.034 --> 13:24.684
- What happened to not judging people?
- There's a limit.

13:24.773 --> 13:25.918
Well, yes, of course.

13:25.998 --> 13:28.004
That's why we would
have a safe word...

13:28.236 --> 13:31.332
That only I would know!

13:32.077 --> 13:33.512
You're Weird.

13:39.918 --> 13:42.450
Oh, man. Never gets old.

13:42.876 --> 13:46.016
I don't wanna sound greedy,
but maybe, if I'm lucky,

13:46.096 --> 13:49.036
I can get the money
and get Figgis murdered.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.090
Whoa. I...

13:51.228 --> 13:53.121
I may have over-smoothed.

13:53.395 --> 13:56.629
Yeah, definitely a little
too smooth, because...

13:57.051 --> 13:59.426
Hang on.
Did I just open that?

13:59.566 --> 14:01.864
No, dummy.
You just got here. Hey!

14:02.179 --> 14:04.489
Come on, Archer.
Get your shit together.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.153
Door wide open,
none of Trexler's goons around?

14:07.244 --> 14:09.379
Something smells fishy.

14:09.668 --> 14:10.988
But also...

14:11.985 --> 14:13.614
Kind of like cuy.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.004
I know.
It sounds disgusting,

14:21.151 --> 14:23.903
but trust me,
it is utterly delicious.

14:24.035 --> 14:26.598
And taboo!
Jesus Christ!

14:26.722 --> 14:29.465
Your family tree must look
like a telephone pole.

14:29.509 --> 14:30.989
Ugh! Seriously.

14:31.124 --> 14:33.524
Okay. There's Archer's car,
the cops...

14:33.613 --> 14:35.067
Park behind them.

14:35.484 --> 14:37.671
And both of you wait here.

14:37.768 --> 14:38.945
With pleasure.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.115
I'm not staying
out here with him.

14:41.655 --> 14:45.015
Okay. Trinette, come with me.
You stay here.

14:45.069 --> 14:46.123
- But...
- No "buts!"

14:46.178 --> 14:47.615
except yours, in that seat!

14:47.656 --> 14:49.999
- Those...
- I know! They're homophones!

14:50.023 --> 14:52.367
- Now sit!
- Oh, all right.

14:52.566 --> 14:56.039
I suppose I could use this time
to constantly honk the horn.

15:00.571 --> 15:04.629
Oh, my God! This place is amazing!

15:05.547 --> 15:07.460
Sorry. I'm just
extremely wealthy.

15:07.543 --> 15:09.742
And loud.
Now, shut up and...

15:09.870 --> 15:11.800
Oh, wait a minute.
Why would the door be open?

15:12.734 --> 15:14.265
Was that rhetorical?

15:14.298 --> 15:16.117
No. Now come on.

15:16.410 --> 15:19.870
Because it could've been left
open for any number of reasons.

15:20.107 --> 15:23.476
Only some of which are sinister.

15:23.843 --> 15:26.273
You are so lucky
I don't have a silencer.

15:26.336 --> 15:28.546
I'm also just lucky in general.

15:33.013 --> 15:35.124
Did you hear that?
Obviously.

15:35.244 --> 15:37.021
Do you think it was
one of Trexler's goons?

15:37.045 --> 15:40.572
- Oh, boy, I hope so.
- You know, as opposed to a ghost.

15:40.798 --> 15:42.703
There's just so few of them
who are friendly.

15:42.770 --> 15:46.171
I mean, basically you got...

15:46.367 --> 15:47.640
Casper?

15:47.983 --> 15:49.397
What the...

15:52.437 --> 15:54.445
Was that a lighter?
Can we smoke?

15:54.516 --> 15:56.765
Shut up! And no!

15:57.828 --> 15:59.296
It's medicinal.

15:59.343 --> 16:01.311
- Ooh, gimme.
- Shh!

16:01.405 --> 16:02.991
Stay here.

16:04.286 --> 16:05.341
Mm-Kay.

16:05.366 --> 16:06.883
Before this is over,

16:06.907 --> 16:08.718
please, don't be surprised
if I shoot you.

16:08.851 --> 16:11.218
Mm-Kay.

16:11.624 --> 16:13.331
What the... holy shit!

16:14.261 --> 16:15.411
Is that...

16:15.622 --> 16:16.960
Marijuana?

16:17.319 --> 16:19.421
Oh, come on.
Give it a rest.

16:19.453 --> 16:21.751
- Give what a rest?
- Oh, my God. Look,

16:21.893 --> 16:24.281
how or why you did it,
I don't know, and I don't care,

16:24.462 --> 16:26.862
but I know burnt pubes
when I smell 'em!

16:26.968 --> 16:28.531
First of all, I... wait.

16:28.579 --> 16:30.719
Why do you know
what burnt pubes smell like?

16:30.814 --> 16:33.179
Because I grew up on a farm.

16:33.781 --> 16:35.367
Oh! Son of a...

16:35.498 --> 16:37.738
- What was that?
- Hold this.

16:39.190 --> 16:41.445
Gonna do your armpits?

16:42.318 --> 16:43.578
Huh.

16:44.418 --> 16:46.671
That's not very Casper-y.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.289
Do... do you think
it's Trexler's?

16:50.390 --> 16:53.078
Oh, please! With your luck?

16:53.292 --> 16:55.710
Oh, sweet mother of Christ!

16:55.809 --> 16:58.046
Wh-what the hell
is happening?

16:58.306 --> 17:00.835
- And why the hell are you here?
- That's it?

17:00.905 --> 17:04.085
No "sorry I shoved you
out of a moving frickin' car"?

17:04.156 --> 17:07.546
I said sorry in advance.
And what are you doing here?

17:07.599 --> 17:10.054
And, follow up, why do
you have a gun? Uh...

17:10.288 --> 17:12.578
Because, you dick,
she's a... Trinette!

17:12.583 --> 17:14.288
She means "Transvestite." I'm...

17:14.397 --> 17:15.930
- What?
- I am not a...

17:15.973 --> 17:17.604
Is that why
your hands are so big?

17:17.664 --> 17:19.429
I'm not a Transvestite,
you idiot!

17:19.497 --> 17:20.929
For the... we had sex!

17:21.038 --> 17:24.054
Ooh. Yeah, but I
wasn't down there.

17:24.228 --> 17:26.992
- Oh, I know.
- No, like <i> down there</i> down there.

17:27.065 --> 17:28.895
Believe me, I know.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.351
Well, that's not very Casper-y.
Poovey!

17:31.488 --> 17:32.851
Aha!
Where's the money?

17:32.974 --> 17:34.976
And the bag that contains it.

17:35.062 --> 17:36.148
I don't know.

17:36.231 --> 17:38.301
Well, then, I guess
I'll be on my way.

17:38.387 --> 17:39.921
- Really?
- No! Aw.

17:39.966 --> 17:41.626
Figgis, get your ass out here!

17:41.977 --> 17:45.171
No. I'm protecting
the ransom money.

17:45.244 --> 17:47.976
From what?
All these witnesses?

17:48.312 --> 17:50.281
Can't have anything nice.

17:50.381 --> 17:53.118
Certainly not clothes.
Stuff it, shamus.

17:53.321 --> 17:54.648
Mr. Vandertunt!

17:54.691 --> 17:57.101
You'll be happy to know
we recovered the ransom money.

17:57.214 --> 17:58.460
- So...
- Well, the main,

17:58.485 --> 17:59.723
thing is the bag, bud.

17:59.724 --> 18:00.898
But, unfortunately,

18:00.956 --> 18:03.093
all of this has to be
entered into evidence...

18:03.135 --> 18:05.898
- Where anything can happen to it.
- Oh, right.

18:06.015 --> 18:07.499
- So, can we...
- No, no, no, no.

18:07.679 --> 18:10.015
First I need to count it to make
sure you didn't steal any.

18:10.053 --> 18:11.937
On what possible legal grounds?

18:12.011 --> 18:14.710
Uh, uh, citizen's arrest?

18:14.783 --> 18:16.688
- Not a real thing.
- You wanna bet?

18:16.751 --> 18:17.759
Do you?

18:17.821 --> 18:18.869
- Kind of.
- Can we...

18:18.926 --> 18:20.478
- Poovey.
- Huh? Oh.

18:20.569 --> 18:23.088
- Lana, you wanna...
- I wanna talk about the fact

18:23.146 --> 18:25.596
that we're standing
in a Cranberry bog of blood!

18:27.486 --> 18:29.535
Well, it is a full moon, so...

18:29.653 --> 18:31.728
It's actually a waxing gibbous.

18:31.829 --> 18:33.396
Oh. Then never mind.

18:33.482 --> 18:37.447
- Were you gonna say a Werewolf?
- No.

18:41.107 --> 18:44.564
- Or was I
- Help!

18:44.610 --> 18:46.392
- Holy shit!
- That's Trexler!

18:46.456 --> 18:48.294
It came from this way.
Come on.

18:48.380 --> 18:50.736
Figgis, you lead the way. Go.

18:50.839 --> 18:55.361
- Help!
- I... I hate to say this,

18:55.439 --> 18:58.057
but... I almost kind of hope
there's a Werewolf.

18:58.118 --> 18:59.932
Not even as a joke!

19:02.391 --> 19:04.439
Jesus Christ!

19:09.258 --> 19:14.354
Oh, please, help me.

19:14.618 --> 19:16.348
I think I would've
preferred Werewolf.

19:16.556 --> 19:19.229
Who... who did this
to you?

19:30.322 --> 19:31.756
What's happening, gang?
