00:21.396 --> 00:22.230
Beautiful.

00:24.024 --> 00:24.858
It's late.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.901
It's great.

00:27.652 --> 00:28.486
It's late.

00:29.154 --> 00:33.366
I'm sorry.
Is this like a post-partum thing?

00:33.450 --> 00:36.077
I want to comfort you,
but I read I'm supposed to respect--

00:36.161 --> 00:39.289
-Comfort me.
-Okay, you wrote a great article.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.540
You wrote it while pregnant.

00:40.623 --> 00:43.334
And now,
we've got a new girl to obsess over.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.045
Right?

00:46.504 --> 00:47.338
Right.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.640


01:02.062 --> 01:04.105


01:04.189 --> 01:06.608


01:06.691 --> 01:08.818


01:08.902 --> 01:11.196


01:11.279 --> 01:13.406
<i>The fake heiress allegedly scammed her way</i>

01:13.490 --> 01:16.159
<i>through thousands of dollars</i>
<i>in gourmet meals,</i>

01:16.242 --> 01:19.496
<i>luxury hotel rooms</i>
<i>and private jet flights.</i>

01:19.579 --> 01:22.207
<i>Sources say</i>
<i>she also conned Manhattans' glitterati</i>

01:22.290 --> 01:24.959
<i>leaving egg on the faces</i>
<i>of society's biggest players</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:28.129
<i>from the art world, real estate,</i>
<i>fashion and Wall Street.</i>

01:28.213 --> 01:29.255
Hey, guys.

01:29.339 --> 01:33.468
Okay, you discussed her at brunch,
you put her outfits on your Pinterest.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.011
Those Celine glasses…

01:35.553 --> 01:39.724
Anyway, today we are dream-casting
the Anna Delvey story.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.769
Okay, I am obsessed with this story
and can I just…

01:42.852 --> 01:45.271
<i>Okay, the "futurist boyfriend"?</i>

01:45.355 --> 01:47.524
<i>Michael Cera, am I right?</i>

01:47.607 --> 01:49.901
Michael Cera? What the fuck?

01:49.984 --> 01:53.154
I'll tell you this much,
she wouldn't fool me, or my friends.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.697
And why is that?

01:54.781 --> 01:56.282
Easy. The hair.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.910
The girl needs to invest in
a deep conditioner.

02:05.875 --> 02:06.793
That's my girl.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.338
That's my girl! That's my girl!

02:10.839 --> 02:13.049
That's my girl!

02:32.777 --> 02:33.820
Sorokin!

02:38.992 --> 02:40.243
I love your eyeshadow.

02:40.785 --> 02:41.661
No.

02:44.831 --> 02:45.957
You can go in.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.920
The rest of y'all, sit down.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.177
I am famous.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.526
Oh.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.527
Wow.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.599
Hmm.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.534
Okay, so…

04:05.286 --> 04:06.371
You want compliments?

04:06.454 --> 04:07.705
No, I just…

04:07.789 --> 04:11.000
No, you did a good job, it's just… It's…

04:11.542 --> 04:13.086
-What?

04:14.379 --> 04:16.256
I guess I thought you were,

04:16.339 --> 04:18.007
like, a real journalist.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.473
I put hundreds of hours into this article.

04:26.307 --> 04:30.937
Months of interviews,
research, fact-checking.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.314
If the people around me
had done their jobs,

04:33.398 --> 04:35.149
the loans would have been approved,

04:35.233 --> 04:38.361
my trust would have come through
and I'd be sitting on Park Avenue

04:38.444 --> 04:39.696
instead of here with you.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.613
That's a fact.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.534
I'm a serious person and you make
me sound like I made everything up.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.952
Like I'm some liar.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.579
-That's because you lied.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.875
There's no trust fund. There never was.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.545
Your dad's not some solar magnate.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.798
KNS Trucking and Cooling,
that's your dad's business.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.967
Legal did research for the article.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.051
We confirmed it.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.514
There's no inheritance.
No fortune, no art collection, nothing.

05:06.597 --> 05:09.767
Trucking and Cooling,
is that what he's calling it these days?

05:10.893 --> 05:13.646
Anna, let it go.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.025
Look around you.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.111
You have to stop pretending.

05:20.194 --> 05:24.365
Whatever kind of
"journalist" you are,

05:24.449 --> 05:27.285
you do understand that
my Russian exile father

05:27.368 --> 05:29.412
might have secrets to hide?

05:29.495 --> 05:30.830
You even made up the name.

05:30.913 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, I told you,
Delvey is my mother's maiden name.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.085
I wanted to make it on my own merit.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.628
Not on my father's coattails.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.339
Okay, fine.

05:43.551 --> 05:47.513
If you were so sure that the money
was coming and you were going to succeed,

05:48.097 --> 05:49.557
then what about what you did in LA?

05:49.640 --> 05:52.727
I don't know
what you're referring to.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.313
-At the Chateau Marmont when you--
-When I what?

05:57.065 --> 05:57.899
Hmm?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.740
That's time.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.411
Hundreds of hours, months of research,

06:10.495 --> 06:13.373
and you still don't know
the first thing about me.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.673
You lost weight though.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.927
Hey, you had the baby.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.428
Congrats.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.449
Where to?

07:29.532 --> 07:30.825
Chateau Marmont.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.245
Ah, the castle on Sunset.

07:35.538 --> 07:39.750
Where Jean Harlow fled her honeymoon
to canoodle with Clark Gable.

07:40.376 --> 07:43.588
Where James Dean jumped out
a window to land a role.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.756
Where John Belushi f--

07:48.134 --> 07:51.888
Oh, ma'am. It won't cost this much
to get to West Hollywood.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.056
That's not to drive, that's to shut up.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.376
-Can you believe it?

08:22.460 --> 08:25.963
It's been what, two months now
and the news alert's still blowing up.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.716
"Does Anna Delvey herald
the end of the influencer?"

08:28.799 --> 08:31.469
"Anna Delvey is peak millennial culture."

08:31.552 --> 08:35.556
"Anna Delvey proved the flaws
in the US immigration system"?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.308
-They never end.
-Mmm.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.143
Viv.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.605
Sorry, just…

08:42.688 --> 08:44.899
Anna Delvey is not a take,
she's not a meme…

08:45.900 --> 08:48.778
I just feel like
everyone missed the real story.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.948
-What was the real story?

08:52.031 --> 08:55.952
Something about class, social mobility…

08:57.495 --> 09:00.164
Identity under capitalism. I don't know.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.585
Maybe it's on me. I think maybe…

09:05.419 --> 09:06.712
I never found the real story.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.757
Viv,
you set the Internet on fire.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.301
Whatever story you found, it worked.

09:18.474 --> 09:23.104
And then she left Central Saint Martins
and got an internship at <i>Purple,</i>

09:23.187 --> 09:26.857
which is a disgusting French magazine
you're not allowed to read.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.196
What?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.323
It's a meme.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.873
"The end of the Soviet Union
meant the end of a way of life.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.042
For Russians high and low,

09:45.126 --> 09:48.296
this was both a catastrophe
and an opportunity.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.007
An opportunity to invent new lives."

09:56.762 --> 09:58.472
In addition to a full kitchen,

09:58.556 --> 10:00.725
the penthouse features
a formal dining room.

10:00.808 --> 10:01.934
Perfect for entertaining.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.604
Now the rugs are from a--

10:04.687 --> 10:06.105
Oh, what's this?

10:06.981 --> 10:07.857
Huh?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.905
I hope everything is to your satisfaction.

10:17.491 --> 10:18.409
Almost.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.082
I'll need a good bottle of rosé.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.169
Oh.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.757
-Tell me you saw this.
-Saw what?

10:32.840 --> 10:36.469
Uh, Anna's Instagram, palm trees.
Those roof tiles.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.095
That's the Chateau Marmont.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.013
The what?

10:39.096 --> 10:41.807
The Chateau Marmont. The hotel. <i>The</i> hotel.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.101
Okay, so it's a hotel. I don't understand.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.271
Anna's in LA, staying at the Chateau.
You can arrest her.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.192
-Who? Me?
-I don't know, the police?

10:51.275 --> 10:52.526
Much as I'd love to,

10:52.610 --> 10:56.155
I can't deputize the LAPD
to comb Los Angeles for your friend.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.990
But the judge
gave a bench warrant.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.784
As valuable as the paper it's printed on.

10:59.867 --> 11:03.079
You know how many outstanding
arrest warrants there are? Ten.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.789
Million.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.874
So, what? We just let her get away.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.209
You said I had a case.

11:08.292 --> 11:11.087
You said "broad pattern of theft."
You won't to do your job?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.923
You know what's on my docket right now?
Ten murders.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.550
A terrorism case. That's my job.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.928
Your vacation money
isn't my highest priority.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.145
Hey, between us,

11:28.854 --> 11:31.148
it looks like she ripped off bankers too.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.442
We are keeping that quiet

11:33.526 --> 11:37.154
because it stands to embarrass
a lot of powerful people.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.950
But the DA is talking
about impaneling a grand jury,

11:41.033 --> 11:42.451
see how far we can take this.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.204
So you are not alone.
You are not forgotten.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.456
The best thing you can do, wait.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.542
Wait for the grand jury.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.131
<i>Thanks for meeting.</i>

11:55.214 --> 11:58.175
Thank you for coming in
on your maternity leave.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.302
Congratulations, by the way.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.971
Thanks.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.641
Return of the conquering hero.
Have you looked at ChartBeat?

12:05.725 --> 12:09.812
Anna Delvey was our
best performing piece in five years.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.355
Socials through the roof.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.816
Phones ringing,
the publishers, advertisers.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.152
"What's next for Vivian?
What's next for Vivian?"

12:16.235 --> 12:19.530
They're asking for your take
on Elizabeth Holmes.

12:19.613 --> 12:22.575
Or Trump. White-House-as-12-George.

12:23.784 --> 12:27.705
Of course, we told all of them that
you're out of commission for a while.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.833
Well, actually that's why
I wanted to meet.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.210
I know what I want to do next.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.588
Go on.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.798
Swing for the fences.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.429
I'll go now. I love you. Bye.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.059
-You're going where?
-Jack!

12:49.143 --> 12:50.561
Sorry, you're going where?

12:51.353 --> 12:52.313
Germany.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.231
Why?

12:54.315 --> 12:56.692
Because what if she's not fake?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.652
What if she's not a fake heiress?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.905
What if she's been telling the truth.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.574
The money she had in New York.
Where was that from?

13:03.657 --> 13:05.826
The rumors that she's laundering money.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.370
All the suspicious answers
that I got from her parents.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.873
-Slow down.
-This could be bigger than Anna.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.376
It could be bigger
than anyone knows and I…

13:17.254 --> 13:19.715
-I know the timing is bad.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.552
I hate when I'm not in
the same room as her.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.764
I can't imagine being on
a different continent,

13:27.264 --> 13:28.766
but everything's arranged.

13:28.849 --> 13:32.645
The magazine bought my ticket, hotel. I…

13:32.728 --> 13:35.397
-Even hired a translator.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.483
And it's only for a week.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.277
It's my responsibility as a journalist.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.534
It's just… as a journalist,

13:46.617 --> 13:49.537
shouldn't you be keeping
some distance from your subjects?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.664
That girl is a sociopath.

13:51.747 --> 13:54.959
She fooled all those people
into thinking she had money,

13:55.042 --> 13:57.336
and now, what if she's fooling you?

13:57.419 --> 13:59.713
It's not so simple. She's not a sociopath.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.841
How do you know that?

14:01.924 --> 14:04.093
Because of what happened
at the Chateau Marmont.

14:06.220 --> 14:11.308
There is more to the story
than you or I or anyone knows.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.563
But I opened this Pandora's box
and now I have to close it.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.963
Sorry, I don't know German.
I'm meeting my Dad here.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.174
Open please.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.051
It's locked. I don't know the combination.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.178
I'm supposed to bring this
straight to my dad.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.265
-Hey! Stop!

17:04.565 --> 17:05.941
Hey, hey, hey.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.574
For your trouble.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.421
Come with us.

17:27.504 --> 17:28.922
Where are we going?

17:29.006 --> 17:30.466
To your father.

17:51.653 --> 17:52.488
<i>Guten tag.</i>

17:53.530 --> 17:56.075
-Mira, your translator.
-Ah.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.826
Sorry, I think I scared you.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.955
Thank you. No, no.
Sorry, I was just daydreaming.

18:02.539 --> 18:06.835
Imagining Anna leaving Russia
and arriving here by herself.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.506
I know, I keep trying to imagine
what she must have been like as a girl.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.382
You too?

18:13.050 --> 18:15.677
Okay, I promised myself
I wouldn't fangirl too hard,

18:15.761 --> 18:19.223
but I freaking loved your article.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.058
That's so nice.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.728
Everyone did. Everyone in Germany
was, like, "We made that?"

18:25.312 --> 18:28.899
And I'm in journalism school, right,
and everyone emailing each other,

18:28.982 --> 18:32.444
like, <i>this</i> is how
you report a narrative feature.

18:32.528 --> 18:36.198
Thank you,
that's really satisfying to hear.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.535
So, um,
when my professor saw that

18:39.618 --> 18:41.870
your magazine
was looking for a translator…

18:42.538 --> 18:44.665
-Yeah.
-Competition was fierce. Hmm.

18:44.748 --> 18:47.417
-Bribes may or may not have been paid.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.919
Okay. Great.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.339
You're awake.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.466
Who are you?

19:36.550 --> 19:39.219
We'll get to that.
First, can you tell me who you are?

19:40.637 --> 19:43.348
-Anna.
-What day of the week is it?

19:43.432 --> 19:45.434
I never know what day of the week it is.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.812
-Do you know where you are?

19:48.896 --> 19:50.981
It looks like a fucking hospital.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.774
Hmm, well done.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.777
I'm the attending psychiatrist,
Andrew Millikan.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.447
You're at Cedar Sinai Hospital
in Los Angeles.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.908
Do you know why you are here, Anna?

20:02.993 --> 20:06.205
You were found unconscious
next to an empty bottle of Xanax.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.290
You're being so dramatic.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.459
I was stressed and I wanted to sleep.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.587
We resuscitated you.
Had you on a respirator.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.172
You're very lucky, you know.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.761
Okay. Thanks. I'm going to go now.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.597
I still need to
conduct a full evaluation,

20:23.680 --> 20:25.766
and you're on a 5150 psychiatric hold.

20:25.849 --> 20:29.603
It means you're here for 72 hours
or until we can determine next steps.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.772
Ugh, what will you do if I leave?

20:31.855 --> 20:33.649
-Kill me?

20:33.732 --> 20:34.983
I'll issue a Code Gold.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.152
Physical therapists
will come and restrain you.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.404
I'm not afraid of physical therapists.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.823
And I'll have to notify law enforcement.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.163
So, let's begin.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.808
So this guy, that's Vadim,

21:07.891 --> 21:10.852
Anna's father, who claims to be
just an ordinary engineer

21:10.936 --> 21:13.730
who struggled to feed his family
after the Soviet Union fell.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.691
Eventually emigrated to Eschweiler,

21:15.774 --> 21:17.609
the town we're headed to right now.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.112
He says he runs
a trucking and cooling business.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.698
-I'm not sure I'm buying it.
-Why not?

21:22.781 --> 21:25.742
Anna didn't exactly live modestly
once she left Eschweiler.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.120
Internships in Berlin and Paris.

21:28.203 --> 21:31.206
Enrolled at Central St. Martins
and left after a week.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.334
Could a trucker afford to
bankroll all that?

21:34.418 --> 21:35.252
Also…

21:36.837 --> 21:40.048
-Does this look like a trucker's house?
-Oh, wow.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.885
So where do you think the money came from?

21:43.969 --> 21:46.138
Oh, sorry…

21:46.221 --> 21:48.724
Oh. Uh…

21:49.474 --> 21:51.143
New parent problems.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.563
Anyway,

21:55.397 --> 21:57.441
-the money, I'm not sure…

21:57.524 --> 22:00.485
…but I think it helps to think
about recent Russian history.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.365
<i>So, the Soviet Union falls,</i>

22:05.449 --> 22:07.701
<i>suddenly all the state-owned mines,</i>
<i>factories,</i>

22:07.784 --> 22:09.453
<i>the whole country's up for grabs.</i>

22:09.536 --> 22:12.706
<i>The men who grab it</i>
<i>become unbelievably powerful.</i>

22:12.789 --> 22:14.041
Eschweiler!

22:21.089 --> 22:24.718
<i>But eventually</i>
<i>Russians get tired of these gangsters</i>

22:24.801 --> 22:27.137
<i>and they elect a new president,</i>
<i>Vladimir Putin,</i>

22:27.220 --> 22:29.306
<i>who starts cracking down on them.</i>

22:30.349 --> 22:33.352
<i>So the oligarchs</i>
<i>start stashing their money abroad.</i>

22:33.435 --> 22:37.314
<i>Hiding it in small European cities,</i>
<i>behind boring front businesses,</i>

22:37.397 --> 22:39.274
<i>like trucking and cooling.</i>

22:43.362 --> 22:45.906
<i>And the height of that mad money rush?</i>

22:46.490 --> 22:51.745
<i>2006. The same year</i>
<i>Anna arrives in Germany.</i>

23:12.432 --> 23:13.934
Anyeshka!

23:14.976 --> 23:16.603
You're really here!

23:21.525 --> 23:22.526
What happened?

23:24.903 --> 23:25.904
Never mind.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.115
Kellner!

23:31.284 --> 23:35.580
A bottle… 1996 Château Petrus.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.582
Dad, what's going on?

23:37.666 --> 23:39.000
What's going on?

23:39.084 --> 23:41.670
We're celebrating our new life together.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.880
In Russia you never drank wine.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.465
We never had anything nice.

23:45.549 --> 23:48.427
Once a year, on your birthday,
you had a Diet Coke.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.845
You want a Diet Coke?

23:49.928 --> 23:52.556
We never ate in restaurants.

23:52.639 --> 23:53.932
You'll like it.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.016
I promise.

23:59.229 --> 24:02.149
Sir, our bar manager insisted…

24:02.649 --> 24:08.029
He wanted to ensure you were aware
that bottle, that's 3,000 euro.

24:15.662 --> 24:16.997
That's very considerate.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.166
I'll take it. Thanks.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.003
And we'll take a Diet Coke too.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.092
I want you to remember this waiter.

24:29.676 --> 24:33.221
How he insulted us.
Because we are foreign.

24:33.305 --> 24:38.560
People here assume
we are poor, desperate, dirty.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.481
But, Anka, I have friends now.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.524
Powerful friends.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.027
We aren't poor anymore.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.237
I like my wine sweet.

25:38.036 --> 25:41.748
You have to overwhelm these people
with your superiority.

25:54.761 --> 25:57.847
Uh, so Anna was smuggling money
for her father?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.307
I mean, maybe…

26:00.392 --> 26:02.435
I know it's far-fetched,

26:02.519 --> 26:05.063
but there are crazier rumors
about her out there.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.606
That's the thing about Anna.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.692
For every three crazy things
you hear about her,

26:08.775 --> 26:10.860
one usually turns out to be true.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.028
Anyway.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.699
Let's visit the Sorokin villa.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.285
Find out what's crazy and not.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.085
Why did you
leave New York, anyway?

26:28.628 --> 26:30.213
I like LA in the fall.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.967
Did you tell anyone you'd be here?
Friends? Family?

26:35.760 --> 26:37.887
Do I have to tell everyone everything?

26:37.971 --> 26:38.805
Okay.

26:40.056 --> 26:40.932
How about this?

26:42.142 --> 26:44.269
Is there anyone
I might be able to talk to?

26:44.894 --> 26:46.563
Anyone back in Germany?

26:49.899 --> 26:53.486
-Why would you want to talk to them?
-It could help you get out of here.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.448
My job is to determine
whether you're safe to send home--

26:56.531 --> 26:59.743
If I really wanted to kill myself,
I would have succeeded.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.958
My family and I aren't exactly close.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.003
That's a red flag for people like me.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.088
Not like that.

27:12.172 --> 27:15.925
That whole life back in Germany,
that's just behind me now.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.637
It's just… gone.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.559
In journalism,
a light touch is everything.

27:25.060 --> 27:28.271
Even when you're banging
on someone's door uninvited.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.314
Especially then.

27:30.440 --> 27:35.195
Get all of your prettiest,
most polite German words ready.

27:35.278 --> 27:37.405
So basically my least German German.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.490
Exactly.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.577
I… I think…

27:45.580 --> 27:48.958
The… villa should be coming up.

27:50.001 --> 27:50.919
Right here.

27:51.836 --> 27:52.671
What the fuck.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.382
Maybe we got the address wrong?

28:00.387 --> 28:01.930
That looks like…

28:02.013 --> 28:03.098
Is that…

28:03.181 --> 28:04.391
Vadim!

28:04.474 --> 28:06.351
Leave me alone!

28:06.434 --> 28:08.937
Vadim!
Please, I need to talk to you!

28:14.275 --> 28:17.529
So, I checked the photo again
and that empty lot,

28:17.612 --> 28:20.031
that's definitely where it used to be.

28:20.115 --> 28:23.868
The villa Anna grew up in.
And now it's just gone.

28:23.952 --> 28:24.911
Disappeared.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.706
How does a mansion like that
just disappear?

28:28.206 --> 28:30.750
Yeah. I'm thinking, from the look of him,

28:30.834 --> 28:33.002
he wasn't as well-connected as I thought.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.380
Maybe he was less oligarch, more mobster.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.257
Maybe storing contraband in there.

28:37.799 --> 28:38.883
Guns, drugs…

28:38.967 --> 28:40.051
Yes.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.304
German police started circling,
he had to burn it down.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.890
-Or insurance fraud.
-Or a rival made a hit!

28:45.974 --> 28:47.016
Or…

28:51.813 --> 28:53.940
Look at me. I was a New York sophisticate.

28:54.023 --> 28:56.151
I was the jaded, irony-poisoned literati.

28:56.234 --> 29:00.530
Now I'm chasing Russian men down alleyways
and doing the full Claire Danes.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.741
-I'm going down with you.
-Mmm.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.745
Did you come to LA
because you're running from something?

29:06.828 --> 29:09.748
-Running from what?
-I'm looking at the evidence.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.917
You came on a one-way ticket,
without telling anyone, paying in cash--

29:13.001 --> 29:15.253
That's not evidence of anything.

29:15.336 --> 29:17.213
Have you ever read Dostoyevsky?

29:18.006 --> 29:21.509
Sure.
I mean, not since college.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.427
Hmm.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.972
My father loved Dostoyevsky.

29:27.098 --> 29:30.226
<i>Crime and Punishment</i>
was his favorite novel.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.813
Insisted I read it.

29:34.689 --> 29:39.068
And there is this one character,
Svidrigailov,

29:40.111 --> 29:43.031
one day, out of nowhere,

29:43.573 --> 29:48.411
Svidrigailov says he's going to
make his fortune in America.

29:49.537 --> 29:52.040
He says goodbye to all of his friends.

29:53.249 --> 29:57.295
"Goodbye! I'm going to America."

30:00.215 --> 30:02.467
-You know what he does then?
-Tell me.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.553
He shoots himself.

30:06.387 --> 30:07.305
In the head.

30:10.266 --> 30:11.100
Well…

30:11.935 --> 30:13.311
at least we're talking now.

30:20.193 --> 30:22.487
Well, welcome to small town Germany.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.323
Let's get started.

30:25.406 --> 30:29.035
See who knew Anna
when she was just the <i>fräulein</i> next door.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.043
He says
he knows the Sorokins.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.796
Apparently Vadim tried to
sell him a freezer.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.800
-But he never trusted them.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.769
What? What did he say?

30:55.895 --> 30:59.607
He said Russians and Turks don't want to
fit into real German society.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.527
He said that to you?

31:04.153 --> 31:06.114
Yeah, welcome to small town Germany.

31:06.865 --> 31:07.699
Hey.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.159
-Hey, your sausage sucks.
-Ah…

31:14.831 --> 31:19.210
Yes, I read your article.
I couldn't believe it. Our Anna?

31:19.294 --> 31:20.795
What was she like?

31:20.879 --> 31:23.673
That's just the thing. She was normal.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.009
A little shy maybe.

31:26.092 --> 31:27.677
Shy? Anna?

31:28.177 --> 31:30.138
That's hard to imagine.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.307
A little awkward.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.766
Head in the clouds.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.768
But maybe that was just her German,

31:35.852 --> 31:37.729
-it wasn't perfect yet.

31:37.812 --> 31:41.024
I'm sorry, I have to get to class,
but good luck.

31:41.107 --> 31:43.943
Can't wait to read more
about our little celebrity.

31:50.992 --> 31:54.871
-Wow, this place, it looks like--
-Please don't say Hogwarts.

31:57.123 --> 31:59.542
Sorry. That was rude. It just slipped out.

31:59.626 --> 32:02.086
How did you know
I was going to say Hogwarts?

32:02.170 --> 32:06.049
Americans think all these old places
look like Hogwarts.

32:06.132 --> 32:08.384
-Fine, you got me.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.471
But look at it.
I wish I'd gone to a place like this.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.014
Hmm.

32:15.016 --> 32:15.892
What?

32:16.935 --> 32:18.478
-Just say it.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.898
-I did go to a place like this.
-Ah.

32:21.981 --> 32:23.316
I hate places like this.

32:23.399 --> 32:27.779
I mean, all these old tiles
and family crests and Latin mottos.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.573
They say this place is German.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.367
And for Germans.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.620
And if you're not German,
you're not welcome here.

32:36.913 --> 32:37.830
So…

32:38.831 --> 32:43.753
if you're from Turkey or from Russia,
especially if your dad is some low-life…

33:33.094 --> 33:36.139
Maybe the cafeteria
will add borscht to the menu.

33:41.477 --> 33:45.857
I mean, can you blame her
for being shy in a place like this?

33:46.774 --> 33:47.608
Maybe…

33:48.943 --> 33:51.696
I don't know. It just doesn't
sound like Anna to me.

33:57.785 --> 33:59.162
<i>You were 15.</i>

33:59.245 --> 34:02.081
Your father asked you to
leave everything you knew.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.917
Your home, your friends, your language.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.295
-Do you resent him for that?
-No.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.631
I believed in the bright future
he promised me.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.425
And when you got to Germany?

34:13.176 --> 34:16.554
No, it's hard for immigrants anywhere.

34:16.637 --> 34:17.847
People were cruel.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.849
-Did you resent him then?
-No,

34:20.600 --> 34:23.436
because I remember what he taught me.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.814
To not let anyone define you by your past.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.233
To show them
the bright future you're building.

34:33.279 --> 34:35.698
I resented that he forgot.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.533
What do you mean?

34:38.534 --> 34:40.244
When we lost the house.

34:40.787 --> 34:44.290
When people said
they wouldn't do business with Russians.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.876
When the bright future didn't show up and…

34:48.795 --> 34:49.629
Go on.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.426
And he started to drink.

34:56.886 --> 35:03.351
The big, strong father I knew
became small and… And weak, and…

35:04.811 --> 35:06.229
and angry and…

35:07.980 --> 35:08.856
Violent?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.070
What would you do

35:15.446 --> 35:16.656
if he got violent?

35:24.497 --> 35:26.207
I read magazines.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.212
I hid in my room with

35:32.338 --> 35:38.261
<i>Vogue, Vogue Deutsch,</i>
<i>Vanity Fair, Harper's Bazaar.</i>

35:39.262 --> 35:42.056
I wanted to learn everything.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.643
So I could be anything.

35:47.895 --> 35:48.729
Because…

35:50.398 --> 35:52.859
I still believed in that bright future.

35:55.862 --> 36:01.742
And I was going to do whatever it took
to get me away from Eschweiler.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.580
Away from the girls at school.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.218
Away from

36:19.886 --> 36:20.970
my father.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.362
What's that for?

36:39.655 --> 36:42.533
Anna, you're crying.

37:09.101 --> 37:11.854
Ask him if he knows
what happened to the villa.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.231
Uh…

37:23.115 --> 37:25.243
He says
that the industrial park

37:25.326 --> 37:26.661
that used to be a chemical plant

37:26.744 --> 37:27.954
that burnt down in the '80s,

37:28.037 --> 37:31.374
I guess the Health Department discovered
the house was contaminated

37:31.457 --> 37:33.376
so Vadim had to demolish it.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.879
Anna lived in a contaminated villa?

37:44.971 --> 37:47.807
So, Vadim was really selling
refrigerators.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.475
The villa was condemned.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.644
He got it because no one else wanted it,

37:51.727 --> 37:53.854
and Anna was just some awkward schoolgirl.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.940
I'm sorry, did I hear you say Anna?

37:57.275 --> 38:00.444
Sorry to interrupt, but you're American?

38:00.528 --> 38:02.488
Were you talking about Anna Sorokina?

38:02.571 --> 38:03.864
Did you know her?

38:03.948 --> 38:05.157
I wish I hadn't.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.576
That bitch made my life hell
in high school.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.454
A teacher told us she was shy.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.248
What do teachers know?

38:12.331 --> 38:14.667
She was a bit quiet
when she first moved here.

38:14.750 --> 38:18.546
And her German was bad,
but then she got obsessed with clothes.

38:18.629 --> 38:22.258
Started dressing better than anyone.
Became like the fashion police.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.302
Okay. That's our Anna.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.662
You're all still wearing that?

39:01.339 --> 39:02.798
<i>Prost!</i>

39:08.262 --> 39:09.347
Oh.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.684
She'd be so mean
if she didn't like your outfit,

39:13.768 --> 39:15.644
which in my case was every day.

39:15.728 --> 39:19.357
-And everyone would just laugh.
-Seriously, Clara? You were the worst.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.026
-You wanted her to like you so bad.
-I did not!

39:22.109 --> 39:25.279
She had a power over people.
Especially when we knew about her dad.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.489
What about her dad?

39:26.572 --> 39:30.201
People said he was, like,
this gangster or something.

39:30.284 --> 39:32.286
And that he beat up someone's parents.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.247
-People were scared of him.
-Scared of Anna too.

39:35.790 --> 39:36.624
Yeah.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.292
-Mmm.
-Oh, yeah.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.418
-Um…
-Mmm.

39:41.545 --> 39:42.380
See?

39:43.172 --> 39:45.549
There's something here,
something big, right?

39:47.593 --> 39:49.428
-Right?
-Maybe, yeah.

39:50.638 --> 39:51.472
Maybe?

39:52.723 --> 39:55.059
We've talked to
half the people in this town.

39:55.142 --> 39:57.937
And what have we got? Gossip, rumors…

40:00.398 --> 40:01.607
You're right. I'm sorry.

40:03.484 --> 40:08.114
There's only one interview
that really matters. Vadim.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.241
But Vadim won't talk to us.

40:12.910 --> 40:13.744
We'll make him.

40:17.873 --> 40:21.293
So when you left Germany,
you were running from something.

40:22.086 --> 40:26.882
I was running to something.
That beautiful world in the magazines.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.717
That world doesn't exist.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.469
Except it does.

40:31.053 --> 40:34.140
In London, Berlin, Paris, New York.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.393
With their nights, parties.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.812
I'd be two glasses of champagne in

40:39.895 --> 40:43.441
and I'd look at the beautiful people
around me and think,

40:43.983 --> 40:46.861
"I made it. I'm here."

40:47.486 --> 40:49.071
"In the center of the world."

40:54.493 --> 40:57.413
And then an ugly person shows up,

40:57.496 --> 41:00.374
or someone tells a boring story,

41:00.458 --> 41:03.669
or some bad music comes on

41:04.378 --> 41:06.172
and then you're nowhere again.

41:06.255 --> 41:07.173
So,

41:08.090 --> 41:11.343
you have a third glass, a fourth…

41:13.053 --> 41:15.264
you take a few pills and…

41:16.891 --> 41:18.767
you wonder where the better party is.

41:20.853 --> 41:21.937
Maybe it's in LA.

41:22.021 --> 41:25.608
Maybe, maybe it's
at the Chateau Marmont.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.280
And then you wake up here.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.617
The best party of all.

41:44.126 --> 41:45.294
Vadim?

41:46.754 --> 41:49.173
-I know this is aggressive…

41:49.256 --> 41:50.299
No reporters!

41:50.382 --> 41:54.053
I'm not just some reporter.
I broke the story. I know your daughter.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.764
She's all alone in a cell at Rikers.

41:56.847 --> 42:00.226
And I don't know what else you are,
oligarch, gangster,

42:00.309 --> 42:03.312
but I know you're her father,
and you should be helping her.

42:03.395 --> 42:06.565
And I can help you help her
if you'll just talk to me.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.112
Mira, can you?

42:13.239 --> 42:14.073
Um…

42:14.865 --> 42:19.453
She's really a nice person,
she's just a little stressed right now.

42:20.162 --> 42:24.124
Also she just gave birth?
I don't really know if that's relevant.

42:25.292 --> 42:27.461
But she just wants to
ask you a few questions

42:27.545 --> 42:28.921
about your daughter and…

42:29.421 --> 42:31.507
I promise then we'll leave you alone.

42:41.350 --> 42:42.268
Fine.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.395
We talk.

42:54.071 --> 42:56.282
Uh, he says
he can't explain what Anna did.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.075
He can't understand it himself.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.751
She always wanted more.

43:07.835 --> 43:10.921
She was always looking at magazines,
wanting the best shoes, clothes.

43:11.630 --> 43:13.799
Lots of girls look at magazines.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.759
Most don't commit wire fraud.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.808
She got reckless.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.533
In Moscow they say,

43:39.617 --> 43:44.204
"Why save money for a rainy day
when instead you can buy Manolo Blahniks?"

43:44.288 --> 43:46.999
"God wouldn't rain
on a girl in shoes like that."

43:50.836 --> 43:51.670
Vadim…

43:55.966 --> 44:00.262
what I'm about to say is sensitive. But…

44:01.472 --> 44:05.059
a lot of people seem to be
under the impression that

44:05.142 --> 44:07.186
you've got money hidden somewhere.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.521
Your own daughter included.

44:11.857 --> 44:15.361
I don't know what's true or not, but…

44:15.986 --> 44:19.281
there are a lot of rumors
flying around this town.

44:20.032 --> 44:25.913
A lot of people here think
you're some kind of, um, oligarch.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.916
Or money-laundering front.

44:29.792 --> 44:30.668
Or a…

44:32.252 --> 44:33.087
gangster.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.101
All he's done is try to
provide for his family.

44:47.184 --> 44:48.352
Can we meet your family?

44:48.435 --> 44:50.646
And can we come see your house?

44:51.397 --> 44:52.773
You have family?

44:57.277 --> 44:59.488
Don't you have family, children,

44:59.571 --> 45:01.657
people you love, would you want this for--

45:12.418 --> 45:17.798
To be honest, the worst thing
is that I'm acting exactly like him.

45:17.881 --> 45:19.842
Drinking to avoid my problems.

45:19.925 --> 45:24.930
It's like trying to escape him somehow
and ended up becoming him.

45:31.103 --> 45:31.937
Um…

45:32.521 --> 45:33.605
What's the next question?

45:33.689 --> 45:37.776
Actually, that's… it.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.780
-That's it?
-I'm signing off on your release.

45:41.864 --> 45:44.158
I think what happened
was an honest accident,

45:44.241 --> 45:46.618
and I don't think you're at risk
of further self-harm.

45:47.661 --> 45:48.537
But

45:49.121 --> 45:52.916
I am recommending you consider time
at a drug and alcohol treatment facility.

45:54.168 --> 45:55.169
Rehab?

45:55.252 --> 45:58.547
I know, there's a certain stigma
attached to that word,

45:59.465 --> 46:02.301
but what we did here today,
that was just a start.

46:03.302 --> 46:06.764
One good conversation
isn't going to change your life, Anna.

46:07.806 --> 46:09.224
The kind of change you need,

46:09.725 --> 46:13.771
deliberate, purposeful,
for yourself and no one else.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.064
That takes work.

46:19.026 --> 46:19.860
It's…

46:20.360 --> 46:21.445
Rehab, I just…

46:23.113 --> 46:25.240
it just sounds so trashy.

46:25.324 --> 46:27.367
You'd be surprised.

46:28.243 --> 46:29.286
Especially in this city.

46:29.787 --> 46:33.332
I mean, the LA area has some of
the world's most comfortable facilities.

46:52.184 --> 46:54.144


46:54.228 --> 46:58.190


46:58.273 --> 47:00.734


47:00.818 --> 47:02.736
Group session is at 6:00,

47:02.820 --> 47:07.324
so until then feel free to explore
the grounds and make yourself at home.

47:12.162 --> 47:15.749
Oh, uh, for privacy reasons,
we actually don't allow photos.

47:16.750 --> 47:20.504
-Oh! Okay, I guess one won't hurt.

47:21.046 --> 47:22.756
Oh, and there's just one more thing.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.968
Um, I don't think we have
a payment method on file for you yet.

47:32.724 --> 47:34.101
Do you take wire transfers?

47:38.772 --> 47:40.065
Can you believe this?

47:40.148 --> 47:41.650
Ooh! Dope pool.

47:42.401 --> 47:45.529
She said I should visit her in LA,
like we're still friends.

47:45.612 --> 47:47.573
Like she didn't steal 60 grand from me.

47:47.656 --> 47:49.575
-Ain't the cops on that?
-Cops are useless.

47:49.658 --> 47:52.452
I can't believe she is out there by a pool

47:52.536 --> 47:55.414
while I am here dodging calls
from my credit card company.

47:55.497 --> 47:59.710
I heard, if you legally change your name,
they can't make you pay that.

48:00.878 --> 48:03.005
What? Chill! Just trying to help.

48:03.088 --> 48:05.632
Easy for you to chill, she paid you back.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.218
And how are you so calm right now?

48:08.844 --> 48:11.179
I'm just not letting Anna take
anything more from me.

48:11.263 --> 48:13.974
No more of my time,
no more of my attention.

48:14.057 --> 48:16.935
I wish I had your Zen,
you're not angry at all.

48:17.019 --> 48:18.478
Here's the thing about anger.

48:19.104 --> 48:23.275
When you're angry, you're just a character
in someone else's story.

48:23.901 --> 48:28.530
But when you let your anger go,
you reclaim your own story.

48:29.031 --> 48:31.408
Become your own protagonist again.

48:32.618 --> 48:33.619
Mmm.

48:43.921 --> 48:46.548
I mean, fuck. Did you see that?

48:46.632 --> 48:49.051
It looked like
he was going to tear my head off.

48:49.134 --> 48:50.761
I think he was just embarrassed.

48:50.844 --> 48:54.264
A man that defensive
must have a lot to hide.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.183
His family
was being harassed by reporters.

48:56.266 --> 48:58.685
-I don't think you should--
-Can you imagine him as a father?

48:58.769 --> 49:00.562
I'm thinking I've been getting this wrong.

49:00.646 --> 49:02.898
What if Anna didn't become who she is

49:02.981 --> 49:05.108
because of her father,
but in spite of him.

49:07.194 --> 49:08.820
What if he pimped her out?

49:09.363 --> 49:12.991
It would explain a lot,
why she never talks about her past.

49:13.075 --> 49:14.660
How weird she gets about sex.

49:14.743 --> 49:16.536
Her fixation on older men.

49:16.620 --> 49:19.164
Oz, Danny Rose, Alan Reed!

49:19.247 --> 49:22.334
Vivian, I think what we just saw
was a man under a lot of stress.

49:22.417 --> 49:24.044
A tired man living a hard life.

49:24.127 --> 49:25.754
You don't know Anna like I do.

49:25.837 --> 49:28.382
A boring life doesn't produce Anna.

49:28.924 --> 49:30.008
I'll find you later.

49:31.093 --> 49:31.927
Vivian.

49:37.182 --> 49:39.810
New York is so washed.

49:39.893 --> 49:44.189
These days all the top art school grads
head straight from Yale to LA.

49:44.773 --> 49:45.983
So, yeah.

49:46.942 --> 49:49.778
That's why I'm thinking of
setting up my foundation out here.

49:52.155 --> 49:54.324
Um… Okay.

49:54.908 --> 49:56.910
-So anyway, we were discussing…

49:56.994 --> 49:58.453
…radical self-compassion.

49:58.537 --> 49:59.579
Oh, excuse me.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.711
Rachel,
you finally called me, bitch.

50:06.712 --> 50:07.587
I miss you.

50:08.088 --> 50:10.257
<i>You know what? I miss you too.</i>

50:10.340 --> 50:13.051
Well, yeah, you'd better.

50:13.135 --> 50:16.930
So, I'm actually in LA for
the <i>Vanity Fair</i> New Establishment Summit,

50:18.223 --> 50:19.141
and, Anna,

50:19.766 --> 50:21.226
I know things have been tense

50:22.060 --> 50:23.061
between us lately,

50:24.271 --> 50:25.689
<i>but I know you're a good person</i>

50:26.857 --> 50:29.192
<i>-and that you always mean well.</i>
-Aw.

50:29.276 --> 50:32.154
I was hoping we could meet for lunch?

50:32.237 --> 50:34.322
Let bygones be bygones. Start fresh?

50:34.406 --> 50:38.285
Oh, my God. Yes, please.

50:38.368 --> 50:41.621
<i>I'm actually at this place in Malibu.</i>

50:41.705 --> 50:43.874
If I text you the address
could you come pick me up?

50:44.458 --> 50:46.918
Of course. I can be there in a bit.

50:47.002 --> 50:49.921
Okay. Bye.
I'll see you.

52:43.910 --> 52:45.996
-I'm sorry. I'm lost.
-Mama. Papa.

52:46.079 --> 52:48.248
-I'm going.
-Papa.

52:55.797 --> 52:58.258
You're the one
who wrote about our daughter?

53:01.344 --> 53:02.554
I guess you'd better come in.

53:15.066 --> 53:18.945
Using your daily affirmations
is a reminder of your own value.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.031
You should see some results
in the long term.

53:21.114 --> 53:23.700
Uh, I've got to go. I've got a lunch.

53:23.783 --> 53:26.536
-Uh--
-Oh, is Spago still a thing?

53:26.620 --> 53:29.873
Anna, you can't just leave. This is rehab.

53:29.956 --> 53:31.958
It's not like it's prison.

53:40.258 --> 53:41.176
Wh--

53:41.843 --> 53:43.720
Rachel, where are you?

53:43.803 --> 53:45.347
<i>Just come out of the gate.</i>

53:45.430 --> 53:47.098
<i>-I'm just round the corner.</i>
-Oh.

53:47.682 --> 53:48.725
Anna Sorokina?

53:50.310 --> 53:52.395
What the fuck?
I'm supposed to meet my friend.

53:52.479 --> 53:54.481
Rachel? Rachel!

53:58.902 --> 53:59.736
Rachel!

54:00.237 --> 54:02.447
There's a warrant out
for your arrest in New York.

54:03.698 --> 54:06.284
Well… What? I…

54:15.293 --> 54:17.462
I'll just take him upstairs.

54:37.315 --> 54:38.149
Beer?

54:39.526 --> 54:40.485
Oh, sure.

55:02.007 --> 55:04.801
He says he's sorry
for yelling at you in the restaurant.

55:05.510 --> 55:07.846
There has been a lot of stress
with all of you around.

55:07.929 --> 55:09.848
-All of who?

55:10.890 --> 55:12.434
You think you're the only one?

55:13.018 --> 55:16.104
Every day. Email, phone call,
knocking at door.

55:16.771 --> 55:19.024
Anna Delvey. Delvey!

55:19.816 --> 55:21.151
I've never heard that name.

55:21.234 --> 55:23.862
So she just made the name up?

55:23.945 --> 55:25.947
Where do you think she got it from?

55:26.031 --> 55:27.824
No. We are not doing that.

55:28.491 --> 55:29.367
No journalism.

55:29.451 --> 55:32.579
Hey, this isn't all on me.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.332
If I hadn't written about her,
someone else would have.

55:35.415 --> 55:38.752
She's your daughter.
She did bad things and now she's famous.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.545
What do we have to do with that?

55:40.628 --> 55:42.130
That's what I'm trying to find out.

55:42.630 --> 55:45.759
Look, I'm sorry for trespassing. But…

55:47.260 --> 55:48.887
it's just I heard all these rumors.

55:48.970 --> 55:50.972
Rumors, yeah. Always rumors.

55:51.056 --> 55:53.266
Since we move here,
always "scary Russians."

55:53.350 --> 55:56.478
Yes, she sells heroin in refrigerator.

55:56.561 --> 55:59.356
They have got Soviet gold
buried in back yard.

55:59.439 --> 56:02.942
Who knows? Maybe I've got
Rasputin's penis in cupboard somewhere.

56:03.026 --> 56:05.779
And now, daughter is criminal mastermind.

56:05.862 --> 56:07.947
Except that one's true.

56:08.031 --> 56:10.241
And she had to learn it somewhere, right?

56:10.825 --> 56:12.911
I'm just trying to figure out where.

56:30.845 --> 56:31.679
Please.

56:36.351 --> 56:37.394
You are a mother?

56:39.104 --> 56:41.773
-Couple of months now.

56:45.902 --> 56:50.115
It's easier to imagine her father,
to imagine me, as monsters.

56:50.198 --> 56:52.867
It is better to believe
monsters make monsters.

56:52.951 --> 56:55.745
Because children, we think we make them.

56:57.288 --> 57:01.501
We think we shape them
and we create who they become.

57:02.377 --> 57:07.173
Because we do for them,
and we love them, and we guide them.

57:08.341 --> 57:09.175
But no.

57:09.884 --> 57:11.386
We do not make them.

57:12.011 --> 57:15.473
Children do not come "from."
They come "through."

57:21.396 --> 57:24.649
So she was always like this.

57:29.487 --> 57:30.738
Do you know, sometimes,

57:31.948 --> 57:36.453
you have a child like my Ivan
and their soul is your soul.

57:38.204 --> 57:42.041
And sometimes you have a child that…

57:44.002 --> 57:45.503
she's a stranger under your roof.

57:48.548 --> 57:51.259
Anna was a stranger. Her whole life.

57:51.926 --> 57:53.261
A cold stranger.

57:58.016 --> 57:58.850
But…

58:00.602 --> 58:04.814
Do you know she tried to kill herself?

58:06.065 --> 58:07.233
In California?

58:09.652 --> 58:11.654
Why would someone like that

58:12.655 --> 58:17.452
who cares about no one,
someone so confident,

58:18.495 --> 58:24.459
someone so free of self-doubt,
try something like that?

58:25.543 --> 58:29.506
I thought I might find a clue here.

58:31.049 --> 58:35.178
Something dark in her past.
I got obsessed.

58:35.261 --> 58:36.471
You care about her.

58:37.680 --> 58:40.808
She's good
at making people care about her.

58:42.185 --> 58:45.563
But if we've learned to let go,
so can you.

58:52.570 --> 58:53.404
Mmm.

58:57.700 --> 59:00.161
You just let her go?

59:02.121 --> 59:03.331
Your own daughter?

59:07.752 --> 59:08.586
No.

59:09.921 --> 59:11.839
She was always beyond us.

1:00:07.228 --> 1:00:08.855
-Vivian?
-You're still up?

1:00:09.772 --> 1:00:11.024
What are you wearing?

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:13.901
Uh, it's a long story.

1:00:15.570 --> 1:00:16.404
Hey,

1:00:16.988 --> 1:00:20.366
I'm going to change my ticket
and go home early.

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:22.577
Oh, what about the follow-up article?

1:00:22.660 --> 1:00:24.871
I'll make sure you still get paid,
but I'm scrapping it.

1:00:25.455 --> 1:00:28.791
What her parents had to say,
no child should have to hear that.

1:00:31.461 --> 1:00:34.047
-I'm sorry I dragged you out here.
-Are you kidding?

1:00:34.714 --> 1:00:38.134
When I could have been
back at school transcribing tape.

1:00:39.010 --> 1:00:40.345
This was so much more fun.

1:00:42.722 --> 1:00:44.682
-Let's go in? Don't forget your bag.
-Let's go.

1:01:16.047 --> 1:01:19.008
<i>The Manhattan</i>
<i>DA's Office is pleased to announce</i>

1:01:19.092 --> 1:01:20.718
the indictment of Anna Sorokin.

1:01:20.802 --> 1:01:23.680
Ms. Sorokin is also known by
the alias Anna Delvey.

1:01:23.763 --> 1:01:26.933
Miss Sorokin is charged in
a New York State Supreme Court indictment

1:01:27.016 --> 1:01:29.852
with two counts of attempted
grand larceny in the first degree,

1:01:29.936 --> 1:01:31.938
three counts of grand larceny
in the second degree,

1:01:32.021 --> 1:01:34.190
and one count
of grand larceny third degree,

1:01:34.273 --> 1:01:35.483
and theft of services.

1:01:36.067 --> 1:01:37.860
Whatever you do, don't mention the Mets.

1:01:37.944 --> 1:01:39.946
The judge is an old-school Dodgers fan,

1:01:40.029 --> 1:01:41.906
thinks they're only in LA temporarily

1:01:41.989 --> 1:01:43.741
and they're coming back to Brooklyn.

1:01:43.825 --> 1:01:45.535
And the Mets are usurpers.

1:01:45.618 --> 1:01:46.828
-Got me?
-Hey, Todd.

1:01:47.620 --> 1:01:48.454
Anna?

1:01:50.039 --> 1:01:51.332
Yo, that's my client!

1:01:56.879 --> 1:02:00.216
So the next time we see her
she'll be wearing a jumpsuit.

1:02:01.217 --> 1:02:02.427
Mmm…

1:02:03.302 --> 1:02:05.138
I knew she was due for a fall, but…

1:02:05.805 --> 1:02:07.890
What was she doing in LA anyway?

1:02:07.974 --> 1:02:09.642
I think she was at some rehab.

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:11.394
Rehab?

1:02:15.398 --> 1:02:16.274
How'd you know that?

1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:20.695
Okay, look, guys,
I wasn't going to say this, but…

1:02:22.447 --> 1:02:25.366
I was actually on the phone with her
when she was arrested.

1:02:25.450 --> 1:02:26.743
Seriously?

1:02:26.826 --> 1:02:29.036
That's a coincidence.

1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:30.955
It was surreal.

1:02:31.622 --> 1:02:33.040
It was awful.

1:02:34.208 --> 1:02:35.918
I hope they're treating her well.

1:02:36.794 --> 1:02:38.045
Can you imagine?

1:02:38.129 --> 1:02:39.297
Anna in jail?

1:02:39.881 --> 1:02:41.048
Bet you can imagine it.

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:17.543
Oh, my God!
I love your tattoos. They're so cute.

1:03:28.304 --> 1:03:31.057
Hey, we missed you.

1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:33.351
Oh, my boobs are going to explode.

1:03:38.981 --> 1:03:41.150
Uh, this came in the mail for you.

1:03:42.443 --> 1:03:43.778
What the…

1:03:48.908 --> 1:03:50.076
Hang on a second.

1:04:00.169 --> 1:04:01.379
<i>Dear Vivian,</i>

1:04:01.462 --> 1:04:06.259
<i>forgive me if this note is not perfect,</i>
<i>I use Google Translate.</i>

1:04:06.342 --> 1:04:10.471
<i>My wife would have kill me</i>
<i>if she knew I send this you,</i>

1:04:10.555 --> 1:04:15.893
<i>but like you, I can't stop wondering</i>
<i>why my daughter would try to hurt herself.</i>

1:04:15.977 --> 1:04:18.187
<i>The hospital sent us these.</i>

1:04:18.271 --> 1:04:20.398
<i>I cannot find the answer in them.</i>

1:04:20.481 --> 1:04:22.191
<i>Maybe you can. Vadim.</i>

1:04:45.548 --> 1:04:48.050
-I hope you're here to apologize.
-Shut up.

1:04:49.218 --> 1:04:51.721
To everyone else your father
was a millionaire businessman

1:04:51.804 --> 1:04:53.097
about to make you rich.

1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:56.309
To this doctor he was an abusive alcoholic
you had to escape from.

1:04:57.143 --> 1:04:58.728
That's not the Anna Delvey story.

1:04:59.562 --> 1:05:01.188
You didn't really try to kill yourself.

1:05:26.714 --> 1:05:28.507
Hi, I'm going to need more rosé.

1:05:29.592 --> 1:05:32.678
Could you send someone up in 20 minutes?

1:05:32.762 --> 1:05:35.431
In case I don't answer,
tell them the door is unlocked.

1:05:46.984 --> 1:05:48.694
<i>It was just another scam.</i>

1:05:48.778 --> 1:05:50.071
You played everyone in New York

1:05:50.154 --> 1:05:52.323
and then you went to LA
and played them there.

1:05:52.406 --> 1:05:53.908
And I let you play me too.

1:05:53.991 --> 1:05:56.327
Hey, I never said I tried to kill myself.

1:05:56.410 --> 1:05:58.245
People just love sob stories.

1:05:58.829 --> 1:06:00.289
Everyone's so eager to help.

1:06:00.373 --> 1:06:03.250
And then I wondered,
why would she go to all that trouble?

1:06:03.334 --> 1:06:04.752
She could have hid out anywhere.

1:06:05.336 --> 1:06:07.880
But she specifically tricked her way
into rehab.

1:06:07.964 --> 1:06:11.634
Then I looked into US visa law.
Yours was about to expire.

1:06:11.717 --> 1:06:14.679
But the clock stops
for hospitalizations, rehab included.

1:06:16.055 --> 1:06:17.515
You were buying time.

1:06:25.398 --> 1:06:26.649
What are you doing?

1:06:32.279 --> 1:06:33.239
Stop that.

1:06:33.906 --> 1:06:35.491
What? Isn't that what you want?

1:06:36.158 --> 1:06:41.038
You solved the case.
You're a real investigative journalist.

1:06:42.331 --> 1:06:43.666
Where'd you get those forms?

1:06:43.749 --> 1:06:44.917
Your father.

1:06:48.087 --> 1:06:49.005
My father?

1:06:49.672 --> 1:06:50.506
Yeah.

1:06:51.340 --> 1:06:54.260
I met him. And he's not a pawn.

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:58.180
Or a fantasy. Or a monster.

1:06:58.973 --> 1:07:00.808
He's a father who loves you.

1:07:04.311 --> 1:07:05.312
Then where is he?

1:07:06.731 --> 1:07:07.898
Why isn't he here for me?

1:07:17.366 --> 1:07:20.953
You've given a lot of people a lot
of reasons to give up on Anna Delvey.

1:07:25.332 --> 1:07:26.208
But, Anna,

1:07:28.127 --> 1:07:30.004
I am still here for you.

1:07:31.088 --> 1:07:33.716
I am still rooting for you.

1:07:33.799 --> 1:07:38.179
And I am here to tell you
you don't have to keep doing this.

1:07:38.763 --> 1:07:40.765
You can do something new.

1:07:43.768 --> 1:07:45.644
Kill Anna Delvey.

1:07:49.315 --> 1:07:50.274
What do you mean?

1:07:51.275 --> 1:07:52.818
I mean, stop the con.

1:07:53.402 --> 1:07:54.653
Stop pretending.

1:07:56.614 --> 1:07:58.657
Admit what you did.
Tell everyone you're sorry.

1:07:58.741 --> 1:08:00.951
Ask for the plea deal back.
Go back to Germany.

1:08:01.035 --> 1:08:03.370
Be with your family.
Be Anna Sorokina again.

1:08:03.871 --> 1:08:06.957
What? So just admit I'm some criminal?

1:08:08.125 --> 1:08:09.585
That's not my story.

1:08:09.668 --> 1:08:12.379
Then what is your story, Anna?

1:08:25.226 --> 1:08:26.519
You're the journalist.

1:08:27.311 --> 1:08:30.439
You… You're supposed to
figure that out for yourself.

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:32.358
Uh…

1:08:33.234 --> 1:08:36.779
Instead you'll have to, uh, watch along
with everyone else.

1:08:38.489 --> 1:08:39.532
Let's go!
