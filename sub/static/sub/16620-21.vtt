00:19.694 --> 00:21.179
All right, kids, out of the booth.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.697
Time to get ready for the lunch rush.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.399
Which is... probably coming.

00:24.434 --> 00:25.800
Any minute now.

00:25.836 --> 00:28.236
It is kind of a slow
start to lunch today, huh?

00:28.271 --> 00:30.738
Yeah, it hasn't really
been a great... month.

00:30.774 --> 00:31.706
For your B.O.?

00:31.741 --> 00:33.208
No. For the restaurant.

00:33.243 --> 00:34.309
Because of your B.O.?

00:34.344 --> 00:35.910
No. I think people

00:35.946 --> 00:38.213
are just eating
other... food this month.

00:38.248 --> 00:39.681
Bob?

00:39.716 --> 00:42.417
Bob, tomorrow's Bog to Beach!

00:42.452 --> 00:43.918
- What?
- Bog to Beach!

00:43.954 --> 00:46.321
The parade. It's tomorrow!

00:46.356 --> 00:49.190
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, I love Bog to Beach!

00:49.226 --> 00:50.992
All the free spirits out on the streets

00:51.027 --> 00:52.093
having a blast.

00:52.128 --> 00:53.528
Well, it turns out my neighbor

00:53.563 --> 00:55.107
is friends with the
owner of The Bear Trap.

00:55.131 --> 00:56.397
You know, the bar?

00:56.433 --> 00:58.399
By the beach? Near the clam shack?

00:58.435 --> 01:01.069
No, but that's okay that I don't.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.738
Well, he always does a parade
float in the Bog to Beach.

01:03.773 --> 01:06.207
But this year he's not doing one

01:06.243 --> 01:08.543
'cause he hurt his back at
the Strongman Invitationals.

01:08.578 --> 01:10.211
So his float is available,

01:10.247 --> 01:12.680
and his slot in the
parade is available, too!

01:12.716 --> 01:15.517
Uh, I'm still not sure why
you're yelling at us, Teddy.

01:15.552 --> 01:18.186
Also, you're really out of breath.

01:18.221 --> 01:20.388
Yeah. I ran all the way over here.

01:20.423 --> 01:24.459
I'm telling you this 'cause he
said you could make his float

01:24.494 --> 01:27.362
into a Bob Burgers float.

01:27.397 --> 01:29.197
"Bob's Burgers," but whatever.

01:29.232 --> 01:30.965
Our own parade float?

01:31.001 --> 01:32.300
Are you kidding me?

01:32.335 --> 01:34.369
I've always wanted
to be in Bog to Beach.

01:34.404 --> 01:37.105
Dress up crazy and dance all crazy.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.540
Whip my hair around all crazy!

01:38.575 --> 01:39.941
Whoo! Get it, girl. Ah!

01:39.976 --> 01:41.309
Uh, I don't know if I want to do

01:41.344 --> 01:42.777
a parade float for Bog to Beach.

01:42.812 --> 01:44.112
It doesn't seem that fun.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.214
Of course it sounds fun. It's a parade.

01:46.249 --> 01:48.449
You start at the bog and
you end up at the beach.

01:48.485 --> 01:49.929
You drink a lot, you
wear crazy costumes.

01:49.953 --> 01:51.252
Oh, I love it.

01:51.288 --> 01:52.754
And some people don't wear costumes.

01:52.789 --> 01:53.988
Or anything.

01:54.024 --> 01:55.390
Sun's out, buns out. Am I right?

01:55.425 --> 01:57.392
But it gets a little out of control.

01:59.996 --> 02:03.579
Plus, I don't really get it. People
pee everywhere, and it smells and...

02:03.604 --> 02:05.833
You had me at "pee
everywhere." I'm in.

02:05.869 --> 02:08.269
Dad, maybe you just don't
like to let loose and have fun.

02:08.305 --> 02:10.125
You're a little grumpy and super lumpy.

02:10.150 --> 02:11.272
That's your jam.

02:11.308 --> 02:13.975
I like fun... I mean,
working here is fun, right?

02:14.010 --> 02:17.445
- Ooh, a customer. Oh, no, never mind.
- So fun.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.480
Come on! Let's close the restaurant

02:19.516 --> 02:22.271
for a few hours tomorrow and
ride around on a parade float!

02:22.296 --> 02:23.151
Please?

02:23.186 --> 02:24.986
Bob, I didn't even get to the good part.

02:25.021 --> 02:27.422
There's a cash prize
for the top five floats,

02:27.457 --> 02:29.824
and there's only four floats
in the parade this year.

02:29.859 --> 02:30.959
There's a cash prize?

02:30.994 --> 02:33.661
- Cash is the best kind of money.
- There weren't a lot of sign-ups

02:33.697 --> 02:35.274
because the weather's
supposed to be bad.

02:35.298 --> 02:37.999
I don't know. Could we 
make a float in one night?

02:38.034 --> 02:40.335
Of course. I'll pick
it up and bring it here.

02:40.370 --> 02:42.270
You just gotta decorate it a little

02:42.305 --> 02:43.972
and drive it down the parade route.

02:44.007 --> 02:46.307
Fifth place gets $500.

02:46.461 --> 02:50.044
So, we get $500 even if
we come in last place?

02:50.080 --> 02:51.346
- Yep.
- We can do that.

02:51.381 --> 02:52.313
We're great at that.

02:52.349 --> 02:55.316
Last place. Last place!

02:55.352 --> 02:57.352
Last place! Last place!

02:57.387 --> 02:58.319
What do you say, Bob?

02:58.355 --> 03:00.822
I mean, $500 sounds nice.

03:00.857 --> 03:02.957
That's more than we'd
make serving lunch.

03:02.993 --> 03:04.626
Uh, all right. Let-let's do it.

03:04.661 --> 03:06.194
Yay!

03:06.219 --> 03:09.063
- All right!
- Ooh, I'm so excited!

03:09.099 --> 03:10.698
Great! We're doing this!

03:10.734 --> 03:12.511
I'll go pick up the float
and drive it back here.

03:12.535 --> 03:14.068
Uh, Teddy, I could give you a ride,

03:14.104 --> 03:16.704
and, oh, and he's
running down the street.

03:16.740 --> 03:18.139
Huh, I wonder if we should hand out

03:18.174 --> 03:19.574
free samples on the parade route?

03:19.609 --> 03:21.476
Of what? Ooh, sesame chicken!

03:21.511 --> 03:24.379
No. Burgers, Gene. Drum
up a little business.

03:24.414 --> 03:25.713
I'm gonna think about costumes.

03:25.749 --> 03:27.181
Bob, you go to Reflections

03:27.217 --> 03:28.983
and buy some decorations for the float.

03:29.019 --> 03:30.587
Don't be afraid of sequins, Dad!

03:30.612 --> 03:32.654
They're more scared of
you than you are of them.

03:32.689 --> 03:34.376
♪ ♪

03:34.401 --> 03:36.578
What do you want, flapjacks?

03:36.603 --> 03:38.826
- We're closing.
- Hi, I just need a few things.

03:38.862 --> 03:40.061
I-I'm decorating a float,

03:40.096 --> 03:41.640
and I'm really not sure what to buy.

03:41.665 --> 03:44.265
Well, you have one minute, and
then we're locking the door.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.108
Oh, okay, fine. Just
tell me what to get.

03:46.133 --> 03:47.769
- Petal paper.
- Excuse me?

03:47.804 --> 03:49.203
Petal paper!

03:49.239 --> 03:50.371
I-I don't know what that is.

03:50.407 --> 03:52.040
Floral sheeting.

03:52.075 --> 03:53.908
It's called petal paper. Buy some!

03:53.943 --> 03:55.043
Okay, okay, okay.

03:55.078 --> 03:56.844
- 30 more seconds.
- Come on.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.246
Deco-puff pomps!

03:58.281 --> 03:59.914
- Wh-What?
- Puff pomps!

03:59.949 --> 04:01.416
- What... ?
- The clock's ticking.

04:01.451 --> 04:02.750
I just don't know what that is.

04:02.786 --> 04:04.719
Oh, you're out of your league, tubs.

04:04.754 --> 04:06.120
What else do I need?

04:06.156 --> 04:07.288
Float festoon.

04:07.323 --> 04:08.923
- Wait, what?
- Festoon!

04:08.958 --> 04:10.224
Open your ears!

04:10.260 --> 04:12.560
They're garlands! Get 'em and get out!

04:12.595 --> 04:14.228
- Fringe.
- He's out of time.

04:14.264 --> 04:16.630
- He needs fringe.
- Buy the damn fringe!

04:16.666 --> 04:17.932
- Where is it?
- That's fringe!

04:17.966 --> 04:19.701
- That's fringe! Pick it up!
- I got it!

04:19.736 --> 04:21.969
Put it in the thing!
Bring it to the counter!

04:22.005 --> 04:23.871
- Here, here, here.
- $65.

04:23.907 --> 04:27.208
Seriously? That a lot for
different forms of tissue paper.

04:27.243 --> 04:30.078
- You need it.
- See you on the parade route, newbie.

04:30.113 --> 04:33.414
Your float's gonna look like
a lousy joke next to ours.

04:33.450 --> 04:35.383
Wait, you guys have
a float in the parade?

04:35.418 --> 04:37.309
Yeah, and we get our fringe wholesale.

04:37.334 --> 04:40.288
Yeah, instead of at a 1,000% mark-up.

04:40.323 --> 04:41.622
- Sucker.
- What?

04:41.658 --> 04:43.224
We're out of bags. Pick it up!

04:43.266 --> 04:45.100
Get him out of here, Harold.

04:45.128 --> 04:47.628
I'm sick of looking at his face.

04:47.664 --> 04:50.331
Look at our float! I love our float!

04:50.366 --> 04:52.078
I can't believe we actually
get to ride up there.

04:52.102 --> 04:54.409
Usually parade floats are
for beauty pageant winners

04:54.434 --> 04:55.651
and dogs that have been in movies.

04:55.676 --> 04:57.483
Where's Teddy? Who's driving this thing?

04:57.507 --> 04:58.740
Ghost float!

04:58.775 --> 05:00.141
Pretty sweet, right?

05:00.176 --> 05:01.987
And look what else I
borrowed from The Bear Trap.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.579
♪ Ba Ba-da-da! ♪ T-shirt cannons.

05:04.614 --> 05:06.447
- Yeah! Nice.
- Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!

05:06.483 --> 05:08.449
We don't have T-shirts to shoot, Teddy.

05:08.485 --> 05:10.618
You must have a couple of
old shirts upstairs, Bob.

05:10.653 --> 05:13.154
You could write "Bob Burgers"
on 'em real quick. Right?

05:13.189 --> 05:14.689
It's "Bob's Burgers."

05:14.724 --> 05:16.591
So what are we doing for costumes, Mom?

05:16.626 --> 05:19.460
Here's the plan... Gene's
gonna wear the burger costume,

05:19.496 --> 05:21.774
and I'm gonna use old bed
sheets to make a ketchup bottle,

05:21.798 --> 05:23.631
a mustard bottle and a pickle.

05:23.666 --> 05:26.100
And I'm gonna make something 
amazing for myself

05:26.136 --> 05:27.146
that I haven't thought of yet.

05:27.170 --> 05:28.302
A crumpled napkin?

05:28.338 --> 05:30.271
Ooh! What if we do a dance?

05:30.306 --> 05:31.973
We could lip-sync!

05:32.008 --> 05:33.040
Mm-hmm.

05:33.076 --> 05:34.475
Yeah. We bring the boom box,

05:34.511 --> 05:36.210
and we play "Hot Pants Rain Dance."

05:36.246 --> 05:37.645
You know that song?

05:37.680 --> 05:39.225
'Cause it's supposed
to rain tomorrow, right?

05:39.249 --> 05:41.382
The float has speakers.
You could crank it.

05:41.417 --> 05:43.351
It starts off slow, and then it builds

05:43.386 --> 05:45.820
into the best disco
song about rain ever.

05:45.855 --> 05:49.056
Three words for you, Mother:
"It's Raining Men."

05:49.092 --> 05:50.458
Fine, second best.

05:50.493 --> 05:52.794
Sure, I mean, maybe
we could play a song,

05:52.829 --> 05:54.629
but let's not spend
a lot of time on this.

05:54.664 --> 05:57.732
I say we just cover our float
with expensive tissue paper

05:57.767 --> 05:59.233
and call it a night.

05:59.269 --> 06:01.536
Great. Jimmy's coming over here.

06:01.571 --> 06:02.837
Hey, Bob.

06:02.872 --> 06:04.572
I don't even want to know what that is.

06:04.607 --> 06:06.808
But, uh, tell me.

06:06.843 --> 06:08.709
It's a float, Jimmy. For Bog to Beach.

06:08.745 --> 06:10.978
Ugh! Bog to Beach is the worst!

06:11.014 --> 06:12.713
Bunch of artsy-fartsy weirdoes

06:12.749 --> 06:14.816
throwing paper cups all
over the place and making

06:14.851 --> 06:16.551
a strange... You know what I'm saying.

06:16.586 --> 06:18.152
We're doing it for the cash prize,

06:18.188 --> 06:19.887
so... there, Jimmy.

06:19.923 --> 06:22.190
And to celebrate the
freaks that weave the fabric

06:22.225 --> 06:23.558
of this funky town.

06:23.593 --> 06:25.426
More the money. And we're gonna hand out

06:25.461 --> 06:27.261
free samples, drum up a little business.

06:27.297 --> 06:29.864
Probably a lot of business. So, yeah.

06:29.899 --> 06:32.667
Yeah, giving away food
is great business, Bob.

06:32.702 --> 06:35.203
And hey, your float looks
dumb, just like your face.

06:35.238 --> 06:37.338
And also,

06:37.373 --> 06:39.933
you have another restaurant's
name on it, so good luck.

06:39.958 --> 06:41.400
Can I shoot him, Dad? Can I shoot him?

06:41.425 --> 06:44.045
No. Maybe. Yes, definitely.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.280
- Gene, give me some ammunition.
- Coming right up.

06:46.316 --> 06:48.082
And...

06:48.117 --> 06:50.585
Don't... don't do it. Stand...
stand down, stand down.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.386
Fine, standing down.

06:52.422 --> 06:54.400
Huh. I know they said it's
supposed to rain tomorrow,

06:54.424 --> 06:56.958
but it's really nice
out; maybe it won't rain.

06:58.394 --> 06:59.360
Oh my God, it's raining.

06:59.395 --> 07:00.595
It's raining so much.

07:00.630 --> 07:02.430
These costumes are like sponges.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.414
I lined the inside
of them with sponges.

07:04.439 --> 07:05.199
Oh...

07:05.235 --> 07:07.364
Yeah, Linda, the costumes are...
great.

07:07.396 --> 07:09.811
- Aw, thanks.
- But why are we all pickles?

07:09.839 --> 07:11.784
I made the first pickle,
and it turned out so good

07:11.808 --> 07:13.140
I just kept going.

07:13.176 --> 07:15.209
It looks like maybe we
own a pickle restaurant.

07:15.245 --> 07:16.644
Someone should have checked on me.

07:16.679 --> 07:18.946
I was up there all alone,
just making pickles.

07:18.982 --> 07:20.259
Well, at least we're here.

07:20.283 --> 07:21.594
Let's just drive the parade route,

07:21.618 --> 07:22.795
get this float in front of the judges,

07:22.819 --> 07:23.784
and come in last place.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.209
The Belcher way.

07:25.234 --> 07:26.454
Honk-honk!

07:26.489 --> 07:29.457
Hey, Bob! Horn doesn't
work. Check this out, huh?

07:29.492 --> 07:31.292
This is what a float looks like.

07:31.327 --> 07:32.927
No, no, no, no!

07:32.962 --> 07:35.763
Now there are six floats
and there's only five prizes.

07:35.798 --> 07:37.064
We're gonna have to beat Jimmy.

07:37.100 --> 07:38.499
There goes our whole strategy.

07:38.534 --> 07:40.134
Looks like we're in a bit of a pickle.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.400
'Cause we're... You get it.

07:43.846 --> 07:45.954
- Why are you doing this, Jimmy?
- Hey, hey,

07:45.979 --> 07:48.243
what do you mean? I love this parade.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.834
No, you don't!

07:49.869 --> 07:52.036
Anyway, I do everything better than you.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.604
So, you're gonna lose.

07:53.650 --> 07:56.017
- Ooh, yeah!
- Your float stinks, Jimmy.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.675
And you're not gonna beat us.

07:57.711 --> 08:01.179
Yes, I am. I brought just a
ton of free pizzas to hand out.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.447
Drum up a little business.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.082
You could learn a lot from me, Bob.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.616
That was my idea.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.619
Sorry, I can't hear you
over how good my float is.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.600
I don't know where to look first.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.576
It's a freak-peeping bonanza.

08:13.601 --> 08:15.066
Oh, look! It's a naked juggler.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.427
So many balls in the air.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.363
Hey, Marshmallow's here. Hi, girl!

08:18.398 --> 08:21.265
Hi, girl, yourself, you
little Bog to Beach baby.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.235
All right, it's time to
start the parade, everybody!

08:24.270 --> 08:26.471
Let's go!

08:26.506 --> 08:28.973
♪ ♪

08:30.510 --> 08:33.077
Hey, Bobby. You're gonna have
to tell me where to steer.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.979
This thing does not
have windshield wipers.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.080
I got nothing down there.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.991
We gotta use the walkie-talkies.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.732
Hey, Bob. It's Teddy, from before.

08:40.756 --> 08:41.719
Yup.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.422
It's, uh... you get
kind of lonely down here.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.823
You just went down there, Teddy.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.303
I just wish I was up
there with you guys.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.626
I'm coming up!

08:48.661 --> 08:50.261
Teddy, no. It's our turn to go.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.397
So go, and drive straight.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.232
TEDDY. All right. And we're floatin'!

08:54.267 --> 08:55.466
Aah!

08:55.502 --> 08:56.968
Who wants a free T-shirt?

08:57.003 --> 08:59.837
It's coming out of the
cannon... Look alive!

08:59.873 --> 09:01.272
Where were you?

09:01.307 --> 09:02.940
Hey, who wants a free burger?

09:02.976 --> 09:04.976
It's coming out of a boy!

09:05.011 --> 09:07.145
Five second rule. That's
not a problem. It's fine.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.413
Time to unleash the beast.

09:08.448 --> 09:09.914
Here comes my parade wave.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.983
Wipe that blackboard,
wipe that blackboard,

09:12.018 --> 09:14.285
kiss your hand, and
wipe that blackboard.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.154
Hey, Gretchen. You having fun?

09:16.189 --> 09:18.990
Hey, Linda. I've been
having fun since yesterday.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.958
I got the date for the parade wrong,

09:20.994 --> 09:22.293
so I've just been out here.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.096
Bye! What are you supposed to be?

09:25.131 --> 09:27.765
I'm a permaid. A mermaid with a perm.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.534
Yeah, you are. Look at you.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.002
Uh, hi, hey! Who wants some pizza?

09:31.037 --> 09:33.004
Lady, hey, come here,
take a slice, go on.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.840
Stupid Jimmy Pesto!

09:35.875 --> 09:37.809
So, Dad, are you loving this or what?

09:39.312 --> 09:41.646
You know what would cheer
up an old crank like you?

09:41.681 --> 09:44.215
- Lip-syncing to some disco.
- Fact.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.185
I gave Teddy the cassette
for "Hot Pants Rain Dance."

09:47.220 --> 09:48.886
I am not an old crank.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.162
I just don't want to pretend
to sing that song right now.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.024
What the hell is he doing?

09:53.059 --> 09:55.359
Hey, back off, Jimmy, 
we're parading here.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.395
I'm sick of looking at your ugly float.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.297
I'm gonna pass you.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.499
What? You can't pass in a parade, Jimmy.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.201
Get your dumb float away from us.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.669
Hey! You see these pizzas?

10:04.704 --> 10:06.838
Now I'm gonna finish
the parade before you

10:06.873 --> 10:08.739
and bribe the judges with them.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.509
What? No! No! You're not, Jimmy.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.245
Because I am not letting you pass us!

10:14.280 --> 10:15.713
I'm gonna... kick your float.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.381
I can almost reach it.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.884
Hey, don't kick my float.
I'm gonna kick your float.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.352
- Hey!
- Hey!

10:21.387 --> 10:23.421
Oh, hey, looks a little
loose right here, huh?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.256
Hey, it came right off in my hand.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.524
You can't do that!

10:26.559 --> 10:29.160
Yeah, get your damn hands off her, Biff!

10:29.195 --> 10:30.561
Hey, what's going on with this one?

10:30.597 --> 10:32.497
It's just coming off all by itself.

10:32.532 --> 10:33.498
Oopsie-oopsie!

10:33.533 --> 10:35.199
No! Our sign!

10:35.235 --> 10:39.370
Ooh! The judges are definitely
gonna take points off for that.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.772
Get back, Jimmy, or I'll shoot.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.375
Aw, come on, you don't
have it in... Oof!

10:44.410 --> 10:46.077
Oh! Free shirt, though.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.279
Ha! Kids, arm your T-shirt guns.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.047
Keep Jimmy away from our float.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.284
Say hello to my 50-50 blend.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.453
You shoot a T-shirt
at a guy like a girl!

10:56.456 --> 10:57.855
So, like that?

10:57.891 --> 10:58.723
Oh, his face!

10:58.758 --> 10:59.790
Good shot, Louise.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.459
Hey. Hey.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.095
Some, ha, crazy float drama
going on up there, huh?

11:04.130 --> 11:06.674
Yeah, why can't we all
just enjoy the day?

11:06.699 --> 11:07.632
I know, right?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.968
Let's promise to never get
caught up in that mess.

11:09.993 --> 11:10.735
Totally.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.737
Jimmy Jr., quick, grab
that fluttery thing.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.039
- What, this?
- What the hell? I'll kill you!

11:15.074 --> 11:17.441
Tina!

11:17.477 --> 11:20.244
Oh, my God. What have we become?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.479
Hey, it's the Belchers!

11:21.514 --> 11:22.580
We know them!

11:22.615 --> 11:23.659
Wait, no, those are pickles.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.949
Hi, pickles!

11:24.984 --> 11:26.817
- Damn it.
- It doesn't look that bad.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.952
Yeah, it's distressed.

11:27.987 --> 11:28.953
Shabby chic.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.288
Flabby chic.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.890
Bob, don't let Pesto poop on our parade.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.793
Bye, Bob. I'm gonna go
give pizza to the judges.

11:35.828 --> 11:38.763
Then we'll laugh about how
stupid hamburgers are.

11:38.798 --> 11:40.665
Ah! We can't let Jimmy finish first.

11:40.690 --> 11:41.732
Why not?

11:41.768 --> 11:43.234
You know what no one has ever wanted

11:43.269 --> 11:44.569
after a bunch of free pizza?

11:44.604 --> 11:46.604
A bunch of free burgers!

11:46.639 --> 11:48.406
Don't speak for me!

11:48.441 --> 11:51.008
Wait. I know how we can
get back in front of Pesto.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.410
Bob, it's not a race.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.145
That's right, it's a not a race, Lin.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.313
It's a war.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.448
- It's a race war.
- Gene...

11:57.483 --> 11:58.583
Bob, it's a parade.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.117
We're having fun, remember?

12:00.153 --> 12:02.019
No, Lin, Pesto ruined our float.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.621
It looks worse than his now.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.756
He's gonna beat us and get the $500,

12:05.792 --> 12:07.491
unless we go to the judges first,

12:07.527 --> 12:09.338
and give them our burgers before
he gives them his stupid pizza.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.494
Teddy?

12:10.530 --> 12:11.829
Bob? Is that you?

12:11.864 --> 12:14.031
Yes, it's me, Teddy.
Who else would it be?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.200
It's just good to hear a human voice.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.090
Teddy, listen, I need
you to make a left.

12:18.115 --> 12:18.801
What?

12:18.826 --> 12:20.516
We're gonna go left here
on this little side street,

12:20.540 --> 12:21.550
and then we're gonna go right,

12:21.574 --> 12:22.773
and then right again,

12:22.809 --> 12:24.275
and we'll rejoin the parade route,

12:24.310 --> 12:26.477
and we'll be in front of all the floats!

12:26.512 --> 12:28.346
You got it. Going off the parade route.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.714
Sounds like a good idea, Bob.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.882
I miss you. I miss all of you.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.818
- Sorry, pardon us.
- Coming through.

12:33.852 --> 12:35.129
Watch your hula-hoop, sir.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.687
- Look out!
- Heads up!

12:36.723 --> 12:38.990
See you soon, parade. Stay funky.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.025
Now we just make a right.
Teddy, turn right here.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.126
Turning right.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.327
We'll go down the block.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.662
Teddy, give it a little more gas.

12:44.697 --> 12:45.908
Now we'll just make the next right,

12:45.932 --> 12:46.976
and we're back on the route.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.499
There are no rights.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.468
Oh, no, the street's curving left.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.902
Teddy? Are you seeing this?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.304
We're gonna have to veer left.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.205
Veering left.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.673
Bob! Mayday! Mayday!

12:55.708 --> 12:57.308
We gotta stop and we gotta turn around

12:57.343 --> 12:58.576
and go back the way we came.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.910
We gotta get back on route.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.246
No way, Linda. There's
no turning around.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.681
I mean, literally.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.349
I don't think this can turn around.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.718
We stay the course, there's
gotta be a right somewhere.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.588
We're lost, Bob. Who
gets lost on a float?

13:10.623 --> 13:11.689
Dad did.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.090
Oh, was that not a real question?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.912
Dad, can I shoot you in
the neck with a T-shirt?

13:14.937 --> 13:16.706
No, you cannot shoot me in...

13:17.254 --> 13:19.518
I mean, one float
can be a parade, right?

13:19.543 --> 13:21.174
If there's anyone else on the street,

13:21.199 --> 13:22.343
I'm sure they'd appreciate this.

13:22.367 --> 13:23.766
There's a guy going to the bathroom

13:23.802 --> 13:24.834
between two parked cars.

13:24.869 --> 13:26.869
Yeah! He's got the spirit.

13:26.905 --> 13:29.338
Oh, it's the mayor. Hi, Mayor!

13:29.374 --> 13:30.973
Oh, it... Oh, oh, that's not the mayor.

13:31.009 --> 13:33.109
There's a right. Finally.

13:33.144 --> 13:34.349
Teddy, turn right.

13:36.581 --> 13:38.281
Hey, it looks like we're part of some...

13:38.316 --> 13:40.216
other kind of parade, I think.

13:40.251 --> 13:42.105
Oh yeah, we're in a parade of town cars.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.796
And there's Mort's car up front.

13:43.831 --> 13:46.198
Bob, we're in a funeral procession.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.919
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What do we do?

13:47.944 --> 13:50.126
Hey, they probably won't even notice us.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.595
Worst case scenario, we
follow this death parade

13:52.631 --> 13:54.864
all the way to a pretty
sweet deli spread.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.132
Oh! Another right!

13:56.168 --> 13:57.367
I think we should do it.

13:57.402 --> 14:00.252
- Teddy, turn right again.
- Turning.

14:00.277 --> 14:02.105
Oh, God, the funeral's turning!

14:02.140 --> 14:05.208
No! Don't follow us! Don't follow us!

14:05.243 --> 14:07.076
Well, we finally lost them.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.812
They'll find another funeral.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.119
I'm feeling good about this.

14:10.144 --> 14:12.649
I think we're minutes away
from finding the parade.

14:12.684 --> 14:14.951
Aw... Oh, come on. Oh!

14:14.986 --> 14:16.920
Oh, great. He's blocking the street.

14:16.955 --> 14:18.822
Hey, Teddy? We got to stop.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.790
- Hi! You okay?
- Uh...

14:20.826 --> 14:22.325
Uh, first day.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.000
- Us, too.
- Want a free shirt?

14:24.025 --> 14:25.250
Uh, sure.

14:25.275 --> 14:27.075
Thanks!

14:27.100 --> 14:28.211
No problem!

14:28.246 --> 14:29.609
Uh, do you need help?

14:29.634 --> 14:32.235
- We have to use the road.
- Maybe.

14:32.270 --> 14:35.071
- Oh, okay, you go up.
- No, Lin, you go up.

14:35.106 --> 14:36.749
- No, you go up.
- No, I'm going...

14:36.774 --> 14:38.741
- I'll go under. Going under.
- Lift it up.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.688
I'll go under. I'm just
going to stand in one place.

14:40.712 --> 14:43.079
- Mine smells funny.
- Your what?

14:43.114 --> 14:44.781
Ugh! We're missing it!

14:44.816 --> 14:46.583
People are just traipsing around

14:46.618 --> 14:49.752
in provocative hand-crafted
costumes, and we're lost!

14:49.860 --> 14:51.187
I think we're close.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.863
I really think we're
almost back on route.

14:52.891 --> 14:54.324
I'm sick of your lies, Dad!

14:54.359 --> 14:56.259
Sorry, sorry, I just
got hot for a second.

14:56.294 --> 14:58.161
Mostly I'm really cold and wet.

14:58.196 --> 15:00.007
Wait, wait, did you guys hear that?

15:00.031 --> 15:03.166
- Did you fart?
- No. Yes, but it was silent.

15:03.201 --> 15:04.834
I think it's the parade!

15:04.870 --> 15:06.469
It's definitely a parade.

15:06.504 --> 15:08.064
Oh, my God, I hear it, too.

15:08.089 --> 15:09.606
Look! Up there to the right.

15:09.641 --> 15:11.007
Freaky parade people!

15:11.042 --> 15:12.442
Butts! I see butts!

15:12.477 --> 15:13.788
Teddy, we've got a right turn coming up.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.478
We're gonna get back on route,

15:15.513 --> 15:17.847
we're gonna give the
judges burgers before pizza,

15:17.883 --> 15:20.283
and we're gonna get that
fifth place prize money!

15:20.318 --> 15:22.385
I knew you could do it, Bob!

15:22.420 --> 15:24.387
I never lost faith in you.

15:24.422 --> 15:26.890
Oh, come on, the road is blocked?

15:26.925 --> 15:28.992
Teddy, stop the float.

15:29.027 --> 15:30.894
Ah, I knew we'd never make it.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.506
We'll just have to put
this thing in reverse

15:32.530 --> 15:34.864
and go until we can get
back onto the route somehow.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.799
I thought this thing
doesn't go in reverse.

15:36.835 --> 15:41.137
It doesn't, but we could all
hop off and push it backwards...

15:41.172 --> 15:43.473
No, Bob, let's not
drive anymore, please.

15:43.508 --> 15:45.575
Lin, but I think we're
close to the finish.

15:45.610 --> 15:46.888
Bob, why don't we leave the float here

15:46.912 --> 15:48.478
and walk the rest of the way?

15:48.513 --> 15:50.313
- We'll come back later and pick it up.
- What?

15:50.348 --> 15:52.348
Come on, Bob, don't you
want to have a little fun

15:52.384 --> 15:53.750
before this whole thing is over?

15:53.785 --> 15:56.753
This parade is not
about having fun, Lin.

15:56.788 --> 15:58.787
No. Of course not.

16:00.392 --> 16:01.758
Well, I want to have a good time.

16:01.793 --> 16:03.593
- Come on, Bob.
- No.

16:03.628 --> 16:05.539
I'm getting this thing to
the finish line before Pesto.

16:05.563 --> 16:06.863
You guys can walk if you want.

16:06.898 --> 16:08.531
Okay. What do you say, kids?

16:08.566 --> 16:09.944
You want to walk the rest of the way

16:09.968 --> 16:11.601
with your mom and all the freaky people?

16:11.636 --> 16:12.769
Freak yes, I do.

16:12.804 --> 16:14.237
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

16:14.272 --> 16:16.105
All right, Bob, we'll
see you at the beach.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.917
Kids, let's go get weird.

16:17.942 --> 16:19.842
Wow. You chose me over your family.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.244
That's not what happened, Teddy.

16:21.279 --> 16:22.612
I'm on it, Bobby.

16:22.647 --> 16:24.125
Okay, we just have to find another way

16:24.149 --> 16:25.214
back to the parade route.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.016
I think we can still beat Jimmy.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.118
And... there he is.

16:29.154 --> 16:32.055
Hey! Is there a parade
on that street, too, Bob?

16:32.090 --> 16:34.624
A bad one? Uh, zoom!

16:34.659 --> 16:36.459
Damn it. It's over.

16:36.494 --> 16:38.094
Wait. What if we ram the barricades?

16:38.129 --> 16:39.228
Excuse me?

16:39.264 --> 16:40.730
We floor it, hold on tight

16:40.765 --> 16:42.098
and burst right through.

16:42.133 --> 16:44.400
Papier-mâché float, solid barricade.

16:44.436 --> 16:45.781
Let's do it.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.771
The coast is clear, Teddy. We're ready.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.306
Here we go!

16:56.748 --> 16:59.015
Yes! Oh, the burgers.

17:00.685 --> 17:02.085
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.431
Is my ass on fire?

17:08.455 --> 17:10.814
Be honest. A little
bit, Teddy. A little bit.

17:12.613 --> 17:14.346
- Anything?
- Nothing.

17:14.371 --> 17:15.784
Well, we lost.

17:15.792 --> 17:16.892
Pesto beat us.

17:16.928 --> 17:18.761
Judges are, like, 50 yards away

17:18.796 --> 17:20.628
eating his horrible pizza.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.265
We can't even finish and
we're so close to the end.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.233
I mean, when you say it out loud

17:25.269 --> 17:26.788
all at once, it makes it sound bad.

17:26.813 --> 17:27.979
Stereo still works.

17:28.013 --> 17:29.314
Want to listen to Linda's tape?

17:29.349 --> 17:30.349
Not really.

17:30.384 --> 17:31.916
Oh. I already pressed play.
