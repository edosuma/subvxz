["Angel Eyes" by Jack Jones playing]

00:11.386 --> 00:14.472
[Bobby] The original dress had paillettes
sewn on by hand.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.349
A woman in Boulder City does it,
but, frankly,

00:16.433 --> 00:18.935
I could retire on the price
she quoted me, so...

00:19.227 --> 00:21.521
I bought a serger and did it myself.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.565
Not even Barbra could tell the difference.

00:23.648 --> 00:24.899
Well, she could, but...

00:25.233 --> 00:27.068
she’d appreciate the bargain.
[chuckles softly]

00:28.236 --> 00:31.281
So, that's what you’ll be wearing
at the Libertine Ball on Friday?

00:31.698 --> 00:32.949
[Bobby, sighing] It depends.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.785
If I can finish the beading
on the white tulle, it’s very finicky--

00:35.869 --> 00:38.288
You know what, Bobby,
why don’t we bring out the tulle?

00:38.371 --> 00:39.873
-I'll give you a hand.
-Oh.

00:41.041 --> 00:41.875
[Debbie] Okay?

00:43.001 --> 00:45.628
-Um...
-I’m boring the shit out of him.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.340
Maybe focus less
on the dressmaking process

00:49.424 --> 00:50.592
and more on the ball.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.428
Like, why you're doing this,
why this cause is so important to you.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.305
It’s a featurette in a listings magazine.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.682
We just need a few good quotes
to help get the word out.

00:57.932 --> 01:01.144
-I don’t do a lot of press, so...
-Oh, I know. That’s why I’m here.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.979
-[sighs]
-[Debbie chuckles]

01:03.146 --> 01:07.734
To JJ. For having such a beautiful reason
to get his ass off that ranch

01:07.817 --> 01:08.693
-now and again.
-Oh!

01:08.777 --> 01:11.821
Please. I am not the reason.
I’m just a perk of the job.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.491
-[all laugh]
-Hear! Hear! Hear! Here's to the perk.

01:15.158 --> 01:18.578
How’s shakes?
KXF still giving you the runaround?

01:18.870 --> 01:20.663
-[groans]
-KXF?

01:20.747 --> 01:23.875
Yeah, it's this little television outfit
out of Orange County<i> </i>I’m looking to buy

01:23.958 --> 01:25.668
to expand my media holdings.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.046
My God, it's worth, what,
11 million now or something?

01:28.129 --> 01:29.839
But the potential’s there
for something bigger.

01:29.923 --> 01:34.594
It's just, [sighs] unfortunately,
it’s owned by this... horse’s ass

01:34.677 --> 01:36.971
who thinks he’s God’s gift
to the airwaves.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.099
Well, sure,
they all think they’re Brandon Tartikoff.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.433
[all chuckle]

01:40.517 --> 01:44.312
[chuckles] Yeah. Well, in his case,
the God part is literal.

01:44.395 --> 01:48.316
Look, I respect faith, it's just
this old geezer actually said to me

01:48.399 --> 01:51.236
that he had to "pray on"
selling his family business

01:51.319 --> 01:52.529
to a divorced man.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.865
Well, maybe you should tell him
you’re dating a nice Christian girl...

01:55.949 --> 01:57.408
[in Southern accent]
...who makes you see Jesus

01:57.492 --> 01:58.743
on a regular basis.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.287
[all laugh]

02:01.663 --> 02:03.581
You had them eating
out of the palm of your hand.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.834
What can I say? I’m an incredible asset.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.752
I got another one of these
on Friday night.

02:07.836 --> 02:11.840
And I promise it’ll be just as boring,
but I’ll be twice as appreciative.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.633
-This Friday. Um...
-Yeah.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.096
I would love to, but I have this thing
with the girls Friday night.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.849
It’s, like, this team building thing.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.018
Yeah, no, okay. That’s fine.

02:24.978 --> 02:29.607
But, uh, if you’d care to step
into my upstairs office, Mr. McCready,

02:29.899 --> 02:31.401
I’d be happy to make it up to you.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.779
[Tex] Oh, in the office. I didn't...
Okay, come on.

Hi, Arthie.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.592
[Arthie] You going to the ball on Friday?

02:55.925 --> 02:57.719
Yeah. Wouldn’t miss it.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.304
Good.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.140
I’m going, too. With the girls.

03:02.849 --> 03:03.725
Great.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.811
Bunch of straight girls going
to an underground drag ball.

Just what everybody wanted.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.360
Yellow or green?

03:14.444 --> 03:17.864
Did you ever have a high school teacher
that wore a mint green suit?

03:18.406 --> 03:20.116
And it makes you look a little sallow.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.451
Wow! [chuckles]

03:21.534 --> 03:25.038
Thanks for the confidence booster
before the biggest opportunity

03:25.121 --> 03:28.166
-of my professional life.
-It doesn’t matter what you wear.

03:28.625 --> 03:32.921
I’m just nervous.
I’ve never auditioned for a friend before.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.590

It just feels... complicated.

03:39.677 --> 03:42.889
Because it’s Sam. And Justine.

03:42.972 --> 03:48.144
Well, you build a brick wall
between the personal and the professional.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.729
Compartmentalize.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.022
And...

03:51.397 --> 03:54.067
get on the road in time
to make it back for our scene.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.693
My audition’s at 2:00.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.153
It’s a four-hour drive.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.656
We won’t go on till after midnight.
I’ll be there.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.366

if you wanna take it for a spin.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.219
Oh, me?

04:21.636 --> 04:25.473
I can’t. I, um...
I never really learned to cycle, actually.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.477
-Come on. It’s as easy as riding a bike.
-[laughs]

04:31.771 --> 04:32.605

I’m not your buddy.
I’m your boss, all right?

And if anyone's gonna teach my wife
how to ride a bike,

04:59.924 --> 05:01.467
it’s gonna be me. Are we clear?

Don’t you care about your future?

Yeah. I just don’t care about whales.

[scoffs]
<i>Moby-Dick </i>is not about whales, Julie.

that cuts through all the crap,

07:00.795 --> 07:04.257
that keeps on driving you, no matter what.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.385
And if you can find the thing
you care about

07:07.468 --> 07:10.555
as much as Herman Melville
cares about whale semen,

07:10.930 --> 07:13.224
then maybe
you won’t totally fuck up your life.

were allowed to say "fuck."

07:16.269 --> 07:19.188

but you think you might wanna...

08:14.785 --> 08:16.496
go out for a drink after,
catch up a little?

-Okay. All right. Okay.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.632
But there’s no point in leaving
at rush hour.

As long as I’m on the road by 7:00,
I should be fine.

08:30.801 --> 08:31.719
All right.

So, Boardner's, 5:30?

08:34.722 --> 08:35.556

08:35.890 --> 08:36.807

09:03.543 --> 09:05.294
Why are you putting "relationship"
in quotes?

09:05.753 --> 09:07.213
-I-- I didn't.
-Yeah, you did.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.298
-In your mind.
-[Rhonda] Right.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.593
Are you seeing him in, like,
an emotional sense?

09:13.052 --> 09:16.931
Or do you guys have some kind of...
arrangement?

09:18.558 --> 09:21.394
Well, that’s a very personal question.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.607
Um... [sighs, clears throat]

09:27.733 --> 09:29.777
Things haven't been good
between me and Bash lately.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.029
Are you guys fighting?

09:32.113 --> 09:33.197
We’re not <i>anything.</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:36.158
It’s like he's sort of lost interest.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.995
It’s been weeks since we...

09:39.078 --> 09:41.080
[mouthing]

09:41.163 --> 09:43.207
[sighs] It's been months, actually.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.376
Jesus, Rhon!

09:45.876 --> 09:48.004
-[Rhonda sighs]
-My God, I had no idea.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.840
[Rhonda] So,
that’s why I wanted to ask you,

09:50.923 --> 09:51.757
-as a friend...
-Yeah.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.386
...if it would be okay if I sort of...
borrowed Paul.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.597
But not how you think.

09:58.514 --> 10:01.434
See, today in the car park,
this guy was flirting with me,

10:01.934 --> 10:04.312
and Bash got all possessive and turned on.

10:04.395 --> 10:08.524
So, I was thinking, maybe tonight,
Paul could come over and pretend to be,

10:08.608 --> 10:12.111
like, a handyman or something,
and make a pass at me.

10:12.528 --> 10:15.364
And then Bash will get jealous
and throw him out, and...

10:15.656 --> 10:18.909
we can have hot sex and just...
everything can go back to normal.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.163
Okay, so you don’t want to sleep with him.

10:22.246 --> 10:26.125
You just wanna make Bash jealous enough
to fuck you?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.669
Would that be all right?

10:29.295 --> 10:31.714
Are you kidding? It's fucking amazing!

10:31.797 --> 10:33.007
-Really?
-[Melrose] Yeah, I mean,

10:33.090 --> 10:34.842
it’s one night
where I don't have to wonder

10:34.925 --> 10:37.762
if he’s off fucking some other woman
for money,

10:37.845 --> 10:39.680
'cause he's off not fucking you!

10:39.764 --> 10:40.890
-[Rhonda laughs]
-[Melrose] Yes!

10:40.973 --> 10:43.351
I feel like Brenda Vaccaro
in <i>Midnight Cowboy. </i>

10:43.684 --> 10:45.102
[in New York accent] "Hey!
I’m walkin' here!"

10:45.186 --> 10:47.730
[Melrose] That's a terrible accent!
And also, Dustin Hoffman.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.401
-So, for Jimmy--
-Nick Keegan, a hundred percent.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.945
Is that the kid with the hair?
Yeah, I loved him.

10:55.029 --> 10:58.491
I agree. He’s pinned
for a three-episode arc on <i>Growing Pains,</i>

10:58.574 --> 11:02.078
but this is a hot feature,
so I don’t think it should be a problem.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.163
That's fantastic. He’s in.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.207
Uh, should we talk
about the English teacher?

11:06.957 --> 11:10.461
Oh, it's... That's easy. It's Ruth, right?
No question.

11:15.549 --> 11:19.762
[stammers] What? Oh, come on!
Come on, she was great.

11:19.845 --> 11:20.971
[Justine] I love Ruth.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.933
I’m just not sure she’s totally right
for this part.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.643
You're the one who wanted to bring her in!

11:25.726 --> 11:28.437
Yeah, because you just wanted
to offer her the part.

11:28.521 --> 11:33.359
Uh, she was good. I just don’t buy her
as this tough-talking woman with a past.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.821
Ruth has done some shit, okay?
You don’t know her like I know her.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.155
[Justine] Yeah,
and if you didn’t know her,

11:38.239 --> 11:39.365
would you see her that way?

11:39.657 --> 11:41.242
Would you remember her at all?

11:42.702 --> 11:46.080
-For me, it’s Angela. The redhead.
-[Jonathan] Yeah, she was great.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.097
What is that?
Las Vegas Public Library?

12:03.180 --> 12:05.433
Still really cutting it loose out there,
huh?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.774
You know what, don’t answer that.

12:13.858 --> 12:14.942
I don’t want to know.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.362
No, this is totally separate from that.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.364
All right. Okay, good.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.701
[takes a deep breath]
It's good to see you, Ruth.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.995
[chuckles softly]

12:27.913 --> 12:29.707
You left without saying goodbye.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.460
Well...
Come on. Goodbyes are for teenagers.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.962
Believe me, I know.
I’ve spent the last six months with them.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.006
Very, uh, sentimental.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.841
Especially the angry ones.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.552
Hey, what's with this guy? Hey!

12:45.014 --> 12:46.640
I think I’m in love with you.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.977
-What can I get for you?
-Get the fuck outta here.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.646
Since when?

12:53.105 --> 12:53.981
Since...

12:54.523 --> 12:56.066
[stammering] I-I don’t know. A while.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.652
You know, we went to the desert,
and then we got lost.

12:58.736 --> 13:02.031
And I went to your room,
but you were gone.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.075
-Why didn’t you call me?
-Because you were <i>gone!</i>

13:05.576 --> 13:07.703
Because I'm-- I'm Midwestern

13:07.787 --> 13:09.747
and was taught
to respect people’s privacy.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.042
And-- And
because I’m still dating Russell,

13:13.125 --> 13:15.795
though I know that I need
to do something about that.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.922
Jesus Christ!

13:22.134 --> 13:23.803
Is it too late? Do you...

13:24.637 --> 13:25.471
Do you still...

13:26.013 --> 13:27.473
Ruth, you’re... [sighs]

13:27.890 --> 13:30.559
[chuckling] ...you're...
you're a fuckin' nightmare.

Oh, my God, we can’t do this here.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.118
-What do you mean?
-What?

13:48.202 --> 13:51.455
I don't want to make out in public
like the children in my daughter’s movie.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.665
I mean, I’m a grown man.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.209
I've got  my own house,
and there's no parents there.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.126

14:33.038 --> 14:33.956
about the movie--

14:34.039 --> 14:35.958
I told you,
this has nothing to do with that.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.501
[stammering] Just listen.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.067

15:02.151 --> 15:04.069
Well, I gotta do what she thinks is right.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.864
-You’re the director.
-I know, but she’s my kid.

That's who I am.

There’s only one act left,
and it’s the big one.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.530
Look, I love you, Sheila,
I believe in you,

23:26.613 --> 23:28.740
but you are not closing my fucking show.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.492
I can’t do a two-person scene by myself.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.744
Well, then sing a song. Howl at the moon.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.831
Grab some big dyke from the audience
and wrestle her. Anything.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.542
Just stall and try not to fuck it up.

you’re going out there a youngster,

23:42.754 --> 23:44.798

23:44.881 --> 23:46.508
Now, go! Go!

23:47.634 --> 23:50.095
[loud, indistinct chatter]

23:59.354 --> 24:01.523
[inaudible]

24:01.606 --> 24:03.608
You look beautiful!

24:21.710 --> 24:22.919
[quietly] "You see...

24:23.795 --> 24:24.963
my mother..."

24:25.380 --> 24:29.759
Oh, wait! This is my other friend. Okay.
[hushes]

24:30.093 --> 24:31.178
[Sheila] "She was brought up

24:31.261 --> 24:32.971
-with ideas of equality.
-[chatter dies down]

24:34.014 --> 24:36.475
-Women's freedom...
-[Tammé and Jenny continue hushing]

24:36.558 --> 24:37.726
[chuckles] ...and all that.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.519
[silence falls]

24:39.644 --> 24:42.647
I came into the world
against my mother's wishes,

24:43.190 --> 24:46.818
and was brought up like a child of nature,

24:47.819 --> 24:50.197
and taught everything
that a boy must know.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.825
I was made to go about in boys' clothes.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.286
And take care of the horses, and...

24:56.745 --> 24:58.955
harness, and saddle, and hunt.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.749
In fact, all over the estate,

25:00.832 --> 25:03.543
women servants were taught
to do men's work.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.881
The result being
that the property came near being ruined,

25:07.964 --> 25:10.884
and so we became the laughingstock
of the countryside.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.179
My father must have...

25:14.846 --> 25:15.847
at last...

25:16.348 --> 25:18.975
awakened from his bewitched condition,

25:19.059 --> 25:20.393
for he revolted

25:20.685 --> 25:22.938
and ran things according to his ideas.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.607
And then came the big fire.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.153
Which, of course, you've heard about.

25:30.737 --> 25:34.449
The house, the stables,
everything was burned.

25:35.158 --> 25:38.870
And my father was utterly at a loss
to know where to get money.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.748
Then my mother suggested

25:42.415 --> 25:47.170
that he try to borrow from a man
who had been her friend in her youth,

25:47.254 --> 25:50.131
a brick manufacturer
here in the neighborhood.

25:52.592 --> 25:55.554
Do you know who burned the house?

25:57.806 --> 25:58.807
My mother.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.436
Do you know who
the brick manufacturer was?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.898
My mother's lover.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.944
Do you know whose money it was?

26:11.152 --> 26:13.488
My mother's. [sighs softly]

26:14.197 --> 26:18.368
All this came to my father's knowledge.
He couldn't proceed against him.

26:18.451 --> 26:21.121
Couldn't prove that it was
his wife's money.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.206
And that was my mother's revenge

26:23.290 --> 26:27.460
for his taking the reins
of the establishment into his own hands.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.882
Well, he lived it down.

26:34.217 --> 26:37.804
And my mother paid full penalty

26:38.263 --> 26:39.931
for her misdeed.

26:42.851 --> 26:45.103
And those were five terrible years for me.

26:47.022 --> 26:50.191
I sympathized with my father,
but I took my mother's part.

26:50.275 --> 26:55.322
Through her,
I learned to distrust and hate men.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.867
And I swore to her...

26:59.242 --> 27:01.244
never to be a man's slave."

27:35.195 --> 27:38.323
Oh, honey, this is Joe.
He came to fix the hot tub.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.368
It was broken?

27:41.868 --> 27:44.120
Just a little problem
with the pump diffuser.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.580
It's all good now.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.834
He did an amazing job.
Seriously, he's a genius.

-With hot tubs. [chuckles]
-[Paul] Mm-hmm.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.175
I didn't know when you'd be back,
and I was a little lonely,

27:57.258 --> 28:00.637
so I invited him to stay for a bit.
I hope that's okay.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.725
No, I don't mind. Why would I mind?

28:05.809 --> 28:07.894
I'm glad you've got someone
to keep you company.

28:07.977 --> 28:09.854

28:11.022 --> 28:13.066
[Paul] Uh, I wouldn't say no to a scotch

it's all part of the job.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.717
Sounds so glamorous.

-[chuckles softly] I could never do it.
-What? Of course you could.

You're so charming.
And good with people. [chuckles]

28:46.599 --> 28:47.642

28:49.185 --> 28:50.145
Oh...

-No, I shouldn't say it.
-No, go ahead.
