WEBVTT

00:05.291 --> 00:08.125
[laughs] Yes!

00:15.958 --> 00:18.583
We have come to an important day
in your journey

00:18.666 --> 00:20.791
to becoming Skylanders, cadets:

00:20.875 --> 00:24.083
-choosing your Skylander senior advisers.
-Hey.

00:24.166 --> 00:27.083
[Eon] You will be paired
with an experienced team member

00:27.166 --> 00:29.916
to counsel you on all matters
of the Skylander way.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.750
Now, first adviser up is Spyro.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.541
-Which of you would--
-Shotgun!

00:34.625 --> 00:37.458
Dragons, unite!

00:38.208 --> 00:43.125
Now who among you would like to be paired
with our Baroness of Blades, Stealth Elf?

00:43.208 --> 00:44.625
-[weapons clicking]
-[Eon] Hmm.

00:44.708 --> 00:46.666
I was afraid this might happen.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.333
To settle this, you will all draw straws.

00:50.625 --> 00:52.958
That's... not exactly what I meant.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.583
But I must say, Food Fight,

00:54.666 --> 00:57.416
your use of light and shadow,
it's impeccable.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.666
-Stealth Elf is yours.
-Oh, yeah!

00:59.750 --> 01:02.375
-Tomato shot?
-I'm good, thanks.

01:02.458 --> 01:04.666
Roller Brawl,
why don't you work with Jet Vac?

01:04.750 --> 01:06.916
You both have similar personalities.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.583
Hope you're ready to never have
one iota of fun again, cadet.

01:11.666 --> 01:13.791
One day the sun is gonna explode.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.208
Yes. I like the cut of your jib.

01:17.833 --> 01:20.583
-Who wants to pair with Eruptor?
-Ooh, ooh, pick me.

01:20.666 --> 01:23.041
I've always wanted to work
with someone with heat power.

01:23.125 --> 01:27.750
Chill. Oh, well, I'm looking forward
to working with you, too.

01:27.833 --> 01:31.000
It'll give me a chance
to learn how to crush them.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.708
-And, Wind-Up, you pair with Pop Fizz.
-Yeah!

01:33.791 --> 01:35.041
Whoo-hoo!

01:35.125 --> 01:36.375
This is so cool!

01:36.458 --> 01:38.625
I've never not had to look up
at somebody before.

01:38.708 --> 01:39.750
Me, neither.

01:39.833 --> 01:43.416
Hey, you like ingesting unknown liquids
and throwing caution to the wind?

01:43.500 --> 01:44.791
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

01:44.875 --> 01:47.875
-Well, looks like we're done here. Let's--
-[cadet belches]

01:48.666 --> 01:52.541
-Bad Breath? When did you come in?
-Well, I've been here the entire time.

01:52.625 --> 01:57.041
Oh, well... seeing
as there are no more advisers available,

01:57.125 --> 02:00.416
I suppose you'll be the alternate,
in case a cadet gets injured.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.291
Oh. It's totally cool.

02:03.375 --> 02:06.083
Whatever the team needs, I'll be ready.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:08.833 --> 02:10.083

-[yells]

02:10.166 --> 02:11.583
[all gasp]

02:11.666 --> 02:13.625
-[Eon] Cy.
-[panting]

02:13.708 --> 02:16.875
Skylanders, Fire Viper has attacked
King Pen's home in Arctic Isle

02:16.958 --> 02:18.416
-and taken him prisoner.
-[all gasp]

02:18.500 --> 02:21.000
-No. What?
-Cy, are you hurt?

02:21.083 --> 02:24.666
No, Master Eon, but we must hurry.
Fire Viper is out for vengeance.

02:24.750 --> 02:28.916
I need you to head to the Arctic Isle
and rescue King Pen at once!

02:29.000 --> 02:31.708
Hurry, Skylanders!
And cadets, as well as Cy.

02:31.791 --> 02:34.500
All right, kick the tires
and light the fires.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.625
Mission briefing in five. Go, go, go!

02:36.708 --> 02:38.708
Really looking forward
to working with you.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.291
-I've heard many good things about you.

03:26.125 --> 03:28.958
Yes, I-- just another late night for me.

03:29.583 --> 03:31.375
My work never ends these days.

03:32.083 --> 03:35.125
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at school?

03:35.208 --> 03:36.625
[chuckles] Yes, that.

03:37.416 --> 03:42.666
I may, perhaps, kind of...
sort of, but definitely, got kicked out.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.916
Kicked out of school?
That sounds so unlike you.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.208
One could say,
it sounds more like your son.

03:49.291 --> 03:50.500
One should say that.

03:50.583 --> 03:54.125
-My son? You don't mean--
-Oh, Mother!

03:54.208 --> 03:55.541
Kaos.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.541
You dare set foot in my castle

03:57.625 --> 04:00.583
after siding against me
with the Doom Raiders?

04:00.666 --> 04:03.750
You cannot just waltz in here
after all you've done

04:03.833 --> 04:06.708
without proving to me,
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

04:06.791 --> 04:08.916
that you're not a conniving scorpion

04:09.000 --> 04:12.791
who will stab me in the back again
the first chance you get.

04:12.875 --> 04:17.625
[stammers] B-But that's exactly why
I made the bold, mayhaps foolish, move

04:17.708 --> 04:19.666
of showing up here unannounced, Mother.

04:19.750 --> 04:24.375
I am fully prepared to prove my undying
love and loyalty to you once more.

04:24.458 --> 04:29.291
To that end, a peace offering.
Something you've always wanted.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.375
Proof you were switched at birth?

04:31.458 --> 04:35.083
Oh, you. See?
We're laughing about this already.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.000
Classic us, hmm?

04:37.083 --> 04:40.166
But, no, I meant a cuddly new pet.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.791
Behold!

04:41.875 --> 04:44.375
-[growling]
-[laughing]

04:45.750 --> 04:48.208
Get that thing out of here.

04:48.291 --> 04:52.833
-You don't like your Hydra?
-I was talking about you.

04:52.916 --> 04:55.333
[groans]

04:55.416 --> 04:56.708
-Mother!
-I'm fine!

04:57.500 --> 05:02.958
Listen, I have far too much to focus on
right now to deal with you. Or a pet.

05:03.541 --> 05:04.916
When I'm through with my work,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.583
you and I are going to have
a very long talk

05:07.666 --> 05:09.833
about your future in this family.

05:09.916 --> 05:11.541
Or lack thereof.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.750
-It's sad. She's crying out for my help.
-[crashing]

05:16.833 --> 05:18.500
But what can I do?

05:20.166 --> 05:22.375
Eu-reka! I've got it!

05:22.458 --> 05:23.500
Do you, though?

05:23.583 --> 05:26.000
If Mother's too busy for me
to butter her up,

05:26.083 --> 05:29.000
I'll just assist her
with her very important work.

05:29.083 --> 05:32.541
That will surely open up her schedule
to spend more time with me.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.625
Oh, and you can stay busy
house-training the Hydra, Glummy.

05:36.708 --> 05:37.875
[laughing]

05:38.458 --> 05:40.541
[groans, sighs]

05:42.000 --> 05:43.958
[Jet] All right, team. Thanks to Cy,

05:44.041 --> 05:46.875
we have a schematic
of King Pen's Arctic Isle.

05:46.958 --> 05:48.166
When we arrive,

05:48.250 --> 05:51.583
each of you will have a unique role
to play in our plan of attack.

05:51.666 --> 05:55.833
It's a very simple two-step plan, really.
In 58 parts.

05:56.333 --> 05:59.416
Cadets, gather 'round
and listen carefully.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.750
-Thanks.
-Bad Breath.

06:03.291 --> 06:04.375
[huffs, sniffs]

06:04.458 --> 06:06.166
[chuckles] It's not that bad.

06:06.250 --> 06:09.875
-No, I mean, that's my name.
-Oh, nice to meet you.

06:09.958 --> 06:12.583
Hey, cover me in cashews and call me nuts,

06:12.666 --> 06:15.708
but do the other cadets
have a problem with me?

06:15.791 --> 06:17.541
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.583
They act that way sometimes.

06:19.666 --> 06:24.125
Well, mostly just to me.
I guess they don't like my power.

06:24.208 --> 06:26.666
It's a little too... strong.

06:26.750 --> 06:30.250
I can't even go on this mission.
I didn't get a senior adviser.

06:30.333 --> 06:34.916
But it's fine. Par for the course
for the "weird guy."

06:35.000 --> 06:39.416
Weird, like someone with a banana head
and monster feet, I bet.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.625
And that concludes Step Two,
Addendum Three, Item R. Questions?

06:44.208 --> 06:46.458
-Then, let's move out, team.
-[Cy] Ahem.

06:46.541 --> 06:49.125
Before we do, Jet Vac,
I want to let everyone know

06:49.208 --> 06:51.333
I'll be bringing Bad Breath with us,

06:51.416 --> 06:53.708
as I am his senior adviser.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.666
Perfect!
We'll need all the help we can get.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.166
Let's roll.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:07.041 --> 07:09.416
That's where I'll put the fireplace.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.958
And that glacier will be the perfect spot
for my lava pool.

07:14.541 --> 07:18.791
But this is just the beginning
of my revenge.

07:19.458 --> 07:21.791
You'll never get away with this,
Fire Viper.

07:21.875 --> 07:25.708
Also, you need the proper zoning permits
from City Council to renovate this isle.

07:25.791 --> 07:28.166
They'll never approve those
for a fiend like you.

07:28.791 --> 07:32.125
Then I'll just do it
the way I do everything.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.125
Illegally.

07:34.833 --> 07:36.833
Skylanders? [growls]

07:36.916 --> 07:39.625
Told you. Good work, my young friends.

07:39.708 --> 07:42.291
Team,
time for "Operation: Defeat Fire Viper

07:42.375 --> 07:44.625
with Rehearsed Battle Plan
and Save King Pen"!

07:44.708 --> 07:47.041
I'm hoping we can follow that up
with "Operation:

07:47.125 --> 07:49.416
Think up Better Operation Names."

07:49.500 --> 07:52.666
Your banter is making me hungry.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
[grunts]

07:55.708 --> 07:56.791
Oh-hh!

07:57.625 --> 07:59.041
No!

07:59.125 --> 08:00.875
Delicious.

08:01.458 --> 08:04.291
But it didn't quite hit the spot.

08:05.375 --> 08:09.041
I can't believe it. He ate King Pen.

08:09.125 --> 08:12.416
Nobody eats King Pen!

08:12.500 --> 08:14.583
-[laughs]
-[cadets gasp]

08:14.666 --> 08:16.833
[yells]

08:16.916 --> 08:19.375
Cy, remember the battle plan!

08:19.875 --> 08:21.125
Agh!

08:22.916 --> 08:25.416
-Banana split.
-[all gasp]

08:26.291 --> 08:31.250
You just ate the wrong
Skylander cadet's new best friend.

08:31.333 --> 08:33.500
When I get through with you, you'll wish--

08:33.582 --> 08:34.666
[yells]

08:36.707 --> 08:39.291
Don't you just hate it
when your food won't shut up?

08:39.375 --> 08:41.250
-[all gasp]
-What do we do now?

08:41.332 --> 08:45.208
-The whole plan is ruined.
-Forget the plan. Just improvise!

08:45.291 --> 08:46.333
[all yelling]

08:49.750 --> 08:50.583
[gasps]

08:52.750 --> 08:54.000

08:54.083 --> 08:55.083

08:56.208 --> 08:57.666
For the love of--

08:58.750 --> 09:00.583
[panting]

09:01.208 --> 09:02.416
[Elf] Whoa!

09:04.500 --> 09:05.875
Uh-oh!

09:06.250 --> 09:07.083
Agh!

09:07.875 --> 09:08.958
Elfy!

09:16.083 --> 09:19.166
Ha-ha! You gotta be quicker than that
if you wanna-- whoa!

09:21.375 --> 09:22.208
[screams]

09:22.833 --> 09:23.833
[gulps]

09:25.375 --> 09:26.541
[all gasp]

09:26.625 --> 09:28.333
Fresh meat.

09:28.416 --> 09:29.291
[all scream]

09:31.083 --> 09:32.083
[howls]

09:35.125 --> 09:36.125
[belches]

09:36.583 --> 09:39.625
Skylanders sure are tasty.

09:40.833 --> 09:45.500
But these heavy meals
really do knock me out.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.250
[snores]

09:52.083 --> 09:54.125
Hello? Is anyone there?

09:54.583 --> 09:57.750
Elfy, is that you? Or is it your ghost?

09:57.833 --> 09:59.083
It's me, Eruptor.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.750
But I can't see a thing in here...
wherever "here" is.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.208
[faint twanging]

10:08.291 --> 10:09.583
-[bangs]
-[all scream]

10:10.958 --> 10:12.833
Okay, everyone. Stay calm.

10:13.291 --> 10:16.916
Just because we're stuck inside
a giant snake monster's digestive system

10:17.000 --> 10:19.208
is no reason to lose our cool.

10:19.291 --> 10:22.208
-King Pen. You're alive!
-Barely.

10:22.291 --> 10:25.041
I'm afraid the heat
from this beast's internal organs

10:25.125 --> 10:27.500
has weakened my cold-based body.

10:27.583 --> 10:31.041
I barely have the strength to pass out.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.375
Wait. Here we go. [sighs]

10:33.458 --> 10:38.083
Chill, can you use your powers on King Pen
to keep him... you know, chill?

10:41.708 --> 10:44.291
Cadets, stay here
while we try to find a way out.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.833
I know one way out of the stomach,
but I don't think anyone's gonna like it.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.833
-[all gasp]
-[Elf groans]

10:51.708 --> 10:53.750
[Elf] I knew I should have brought
galoshes.

10:53.833 --> 10:57.875
I can't believe we're stuck down here.
It's all because of you!

10:57.958 --> 10:59.541
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.666
Uh, she was being sarcastic.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.125
At least we know King Pen is safe, right?

11:04.208 --> 11:06.500
He was eaten by a giant snake.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.625
You have a really strange definition
of "safe," you know?

11:09.708 --> 11:13.208
-Some Skylander you are, banana boy.
-That's enough!

11:13.291 --> 11:15.666
This isn't his fault. You all know it.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.833
Whatever, Bad Breath.
You shouldn't even be here.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.333
Yes, I should.

11:20.416 --> 11:22.416
Just because you don't think
I'm good enough

11:22.500 --> 11:24.833
for your little reindeer games
doesn't mean I'm not.

11:24.916 --> 11:28.041
I was about to become a Skylander
way before any of you.

11:28.125 --> 11:32.083
-Jeez, someone is a little touchy.
-You bet your scales I am.

11:32.166 --> 11:36.541
But at least I don't spend all my time
being jealous of Skylanders like Cy,

11:36.625 --> 11:37.916
who's earned his stripes!

11:38.875 --> 11:41.916
Maybe if you all concentrated more
on your own training,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.541
you could've done something
to stop Fire Viper.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.041
[groaning]

11:50.625 --> 11:53.541
That's right, jerk.
You'll never see the light of day--

11:53.625 --> 11:55.916
[Kaos] Oh, Mother!

11:56.541 --> 11:57.458
How's it going?

11:57.541 --> 11:59.500
I thought since you'd been working
so hard,

11:59.583 --> 12:01.541
you could use a home-cooked meal.

12:01.625 --> 12:05.416
And I made your favorite,
fish head sliders with newt fries.

12:05.500 --> 12:09.333
That's not my favorite.
That's  your  favorite.

12:09.416 --> 12:12.541
Now all my work today is ruined!

12:12.625 --> 12:19.458
How many times must I tell you,
do not interrupt me when I'm-- oh!

12:20.166 --> 12:23.208
Mother! You need rest.
Let me get you to your bed.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.541
[grunts]

12:25.416 --> 12:28.083
[grunts]
Or this is a comfortable spot, too.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.916
Oh! Everyone, everyone,
I have stupendous news.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.833
My master plan
has finally come to fruition.

12:35.958 --> 12:39.625
The tracking device installed in the Hydra
has given me a location

12:39.708 --> 12:42.500
where we can find it
at Kaossandra's castle.

12:42.583 --> 12:43.750
[whistling]

12:46.833 --> 12:48.333
-Hmm.
-[beeps]

12:49.625 --> 12:50.916
Wonder what this does.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.416
[splashes]

12:53.125 --> 12:56.708
Now prepare for war, Doom Raiders,
because tonight--

12:56.791 --> 12:58.916
-[tracker beeping]
-"Signal lost"?

13:00.541 --> 13:02.750
What do you mean "signal lost"?

13:04.833 --> 13:07.000
No!

13:09.500 --> 13:10.833
[squeals]

13:11.666 --> 13:12.750
[snoring]

13:12.833 --> 13:15.083
I was this close
to making headway with Mother

13:15.166 --> 13:17.541
when she had passed out
due to exhaustion again.

13:17.625 --> 13:20.333
I mean, seriously,
how is she supposed to forgive me

13:20.416 --> 13:22.083
when she's unconscious all the time?

13:22.583 --> 13:25.083
There must be something I can do
to help her.

13:25.166 --> 13:28.666
If only I could use my dark powers
in some way.

13:28.750 --> 13:29.583
Agh!

13:29.666 --> 13:32.958
I might know a way for you to win back
your mother's love forever, sir.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.250
Tell me, Glumshanks.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.333
I'll do whatever it takes
to prove to Mother

13:36.416 --> 13:39.666
she will never have to doubt
my loyalty to her ever again!

13:40.875 --> 13:42.208
[snoring]

13:44.958 --> 13:47.500
You guys don't seem very united right now.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.458
Something happen while we were gone?

13:50.791 --> 13:52.416
Okay, here it is.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.958
We don't think it's fair
how Cy got to become a Skylander.

13:55.041 --> 13:58.250
He didn't have to train or graduate
from the Academy like us.

13:58.333 --> 14:02.458
Yeah. How come he doesn't have to jump
through the same hoops we do?

14:02.541 --> 14:04.916
You know, when I first joined the Academy,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
I faced all kinds of prejudice
from the other cadets.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.666
They resented the fact
that I was raised by Eon,

14:10.750 --> 14:13.000
and that things came easier for me
than most.

14:13.083 --> 14:15.125
You could say back in those days, I was--

14:15.208 --> 14:16.500
-Cocky?
-Full of yourself?

14:16.583 --> 14:19.083
A self-obsessed braggart
blessed by nepotism?

14:19.458 --> 14:22.833
Uh, I was gonna say
"nervous to impress my friends."

14:22.916 --> 14:24.458
-Oh.
-Sure, sure.

14:24.833 --> 14:28.750
But you know who the cadet was
that was tougher on me than anyone?

14:29.333 --> 14:32.625
Well, let's just say that person
wasn't very  stealth

14:32.708 --> 14:34.000
about their feelings toward me.

14:34.333 --> 14:38.166
In the end, Spyro was so determined
to justify his spot on the team,

14:38.250 --> 14:40.625
he did everything in his power
to prove himself to us.

14:40.958 --> 14:42.875
Now I'm proud to call him my best friend.

14:44.833 --> 14:48.625
Maybe if you gave Cy and Bad Breath
a chance to show what they're made of,

14:48.708 --> 14:51.750
you'd see they're as much Skylanders
as anyone else.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.416
-Guys, come quick!
-[all gasp]

14:54.333 --> 14:56.458
Sensei, are you all right?

14:56.541 --> 14:59.750
I think so,
but I fear the rest of our world is not.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.500
A new darkness
spreads across the Skylands.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.250
What do you mean "a new darkness"?

15:05.333 --> 15:08.208
Fire Viper should have never been able
to survive

15:08.291 --> 15:10.666
the sub-zero temperatures here
in my Arctic Realm.

15:10.750 --> 15:13.208
The last time Fire Vipers
were able to do so

15:13.583 --> 15:16.250
was during the Great War.
And back then,

15:16.333 --> 15:19.916
our true enemy was so lethal
that had we not defeated him,

15:20.000 --> 15:23.041
we'd all be living
in very dark, cold times.

15:23.125 --> 15:27.250
Thankfully, we struck down our foe,
but suffered great losses in the fight.

15:27.833 --> 15:31.000
But you know all about that,
don't you, Spyro?

15:32.916 --> 15:34.291
I do?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.916
[growls]

15:37.583 --> 15:39.791
-[all gasping]
-Whoa!

15:39.875 --> 15:41.166
Fire Viper has awakened.

15:41.250 --> 15:44.250
We must do something,
or we will be digested.

15:48.958 --> 15:50.583
I can't keep my grip!

15:50.666 --> 15:52.291
At least you have a grip.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.708
Try hanging on with no fingers.

15:54.791 --> 15:56.833
-[belches]
-[all groan]

15:56.916 --> 15:59.208
-Bad Breath!
-I can't help it, Cynder.

15:59.291 --> 16:03.208
Intense fear of being digested
by fire-breathing serpents makes me...

16:03.291 --> 16:04.958
[belches] ...gassy.

16:05.041 --> 16:07.166
-[all groan]
-Oh, my gosh.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.750
[gasps, groans]

16:08.833 --> 16:10.625
[groans]

16:10.708 --> 16:12.166
That's it, Bad Breath.

16:12.250 --> 16:15.291
You must embrace your rancid gift
and use it to save us.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.916
So you want me to burp?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.750
I'm struggling to find
an eloquent way to say this,

16:19.833 --> 16:21.500
so I'll just cut to the chase.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.625
Belch, man! Belch for our lives!

16:24.208 --> 16:28.708
But... I don't want everyone to hate me
more than they already do.

16:28.791 --> 16:31.000
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.

16:31.083 --> 16:33.291
If there's one thing
the Skylanders taught me,

16:33.375 --> 16:35.666
it's to always be yourself.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.041
He's right. It's time for you to be you!

16:39.125 --> 16:44.083
Even if that means you smell
like flaming desert diapers sometimes.

16:45.041 --> 16:50.958
Okay, everyone, plug your noses.
It's about to get funky up in here.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
[growls]

16:55.375 --> 16:56.375
[belches]

16:56.875 --> 16:59.833
I should've skipped the one... [belches]

16:59.916 --> 17:02.375
...who looks like an artichoke. [gasps]

17:03.791 --> 17:06.040
-[retches]
-[all scream]

17:06.625 --> 17:09.250
We made it! King Pen's plan worked!

17:09.333 --> 17:12.833
And only one cadet could've pulled it off.
Thank you, Bad Breath.

17:12.915 --> 17:14.750
[all] Yeah, Bad Breath!

17:14.833 --> 17:16.958
Hug it out after we win, Skylanders.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.665
We need to attack Fire Viper
while he's still vulnerable.

17:19.750 --> 17:22.083
Bad Breath, lead the way!

17:22.165 --> 17:24.125
Cadets, unite!

17:25.583 --> 17:26.458
[growls]

17:30.541 --> 17:32.333
[grunting]

17:35.125 --> 17:36.375
[grunts]

17:40.666 --> 17:42.458
[moans]

17:43.458 --> 17:44.291
[growls]

17:44.375 --> 17:46.625
Finish him off, new BFF.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.166
[growls]

17:51.333 --> 17:52.375
[Viper moans]

17:52.458 --> 17:54.125
[cadets cheering]

17:54.208 --> 17:56.583
Such a proud adviser right now.

17:56.666 --> 17:58.375
They grow up so fast.

18:00.875 --> 18:04.125
Cy, we're sorry we ever doubted
your abilities as a Skylander.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.958
You truly are one of us,
even if you got here in a different way.

18:08.041 --> 18:10.750
Oh, please,
I got here the same way you did,

18:11.333 --> 18:14.458
by being stitched together
like a freaky Frankenstein

18:14.541 --> 18:16.375
from various surreal figments
of imagination.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.375
King Pen, can I ask you a question?

18:23.458 --> 18:24.833
I was wondering...

18:25.958 --> 18:27.291
what did you mean earlier

18:27.375 --> 18:30.500
when you said I should know
about the losses of the past?

18:30.583 --> 18:34.208
I... I don't remember saying that.

18:34.291 --> 18:38.416
I mean, if I did, I was very weak,
and obviously not in my right mind.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.083
To quote the great Pen Gwen,

18:41.166 --> 18:45.875
"Consciousness is a fragile flower blowing
in the violent winds of the soul."

18:47.166 --> 18:48.916
It means I was talking gibberish.

18:49.541 --> 18:52.625
Come, let us join your friends
and revel in your victory.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.666
Mother? It's me, your loving son.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.250
[moans]

19:03.083 --> 19:05.791
Go on, sir. This will work, I promise.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.166
Ahem. [sighs]

19:09.250 --> 19:10.541
Mother...

19:11.166 --> 19:13.958
as a gesture
of my undying love and devotion...

19:14.458 --> 19:18.416
I've come to make the ultimate sacrifice
to nurse you back to health.

19:18.500 --> 19:23.958
I told you, I don't want a pet.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.583
It's not the Hydra.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.291
I have something
that will help you regain strength

19:29.375 --> 19:31.666
above and beyond
what you could possibly need

19:31.750 --> 19:34.500
to handle your work here
in the Me-ditation Chamber.

19:34.583 --> 19:38.166
Something that will make you
more powerful than ever before.

19:38.541 --> 19:40.000
I want to give you...

19:41.125 --> 19:43.958
my dark magic power. Hmm?

19:44.041 --> 19:45.833
[faint gasp]

19:46.375 --> 19:48.333
All right then. [cracks knuckles]

19:48.416 --> 19:49.500
Let's do this.

19:51.583 --> 19:52.416
Huh?

19:55.750 --> 19:56.583
[gasps]

20:01.125 --> 20:03.541
[buzzing]

20:06.041 --> 20:07.208
Ugh!

20:07.500 --> 20:09.708
Are you okay, sir? [yelps]

20:11.458 --> 20:15.958
Kaos, that was a truly noble
and selfless act.

20:16.041 --> 20:17.583
I thank you, and...

20:18.333 --> 20:21.083
I forgive you for betraying me.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.583
-And you love--
-Don't push your luck.

20:23.666 --> 20:25.375
Right. Work in progress.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.916
Now it is time to resume my work.

20:29.208 --> 20:32.041
Well, Glummy,
I guess it's back to square one.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.833
No powers, no Doom Raiders, no hair.

20:35.541 --> 20:38.000
But you have me, sir. And I daresay,

20:38.083 --> 20:41.041
without a hint of irony,
I am proud of you.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.333
Yeah?

20:43.416 --> 20:44.416
Don't care.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.833
["Harmony" playing]

20:45.916 --> 20:48.416
Do I really want to watch another episode?

20:48.500 --> 20:51.750
Oh, please, tablet.
What kind of question is that?

20:51.833 --> 20:53.041
[King Pen] Master Eon.

20:54.291 --> 20:59.375
Ah, King Pen, my dear friend.
What a nice and creepy surprise.

20:59.458 --> 21:04.458
I was so glad to hear of your rescue
from the Fire Viper's clutches.

21:04.541 --> 21:06.833
A victory to be short-lived, I'm afraid,

21:06.916 --> 21:09.500
for we have much graver concerns
at our doorstep.

21:10.041 --> 21:12.375
A new darkness
is approaching our horizon.

21:12.458 --> 21:15.500
And I feel our common enemy
is on his way back.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.958
I've been sensing his presence as well
for quite some time.

21:19.041 --> 21:21.916
I didn't want to admit
it could really be true.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.416
We both know exactly what he'll seek out
when he arrives.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.708
Or shall I say...

21:27.458 --> 21:28.666
-who.
