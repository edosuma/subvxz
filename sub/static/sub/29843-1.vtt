Cheers, Sidders, to our
continued success.

Ken!

04:36.082 --> 04:37.113
What the fuck is happening?

04:37.115 --> 04:38.646
We're half empty.

04:38.648 --> 04:39.879
We're out of pills mate.

04:39.881 --> 04:41.279
All we've got left is a few is
a few stragglers doing coke.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.213
It's shit in here.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.779
Have you told Tony?

04:43.781 --> 04:44.946
No, not yet.

04:44.948 --> 04:45.813
Where is he?

04:45.815 --> 04:47.213
He's in the back office with
Craig.

04:47.215 --> 04:48.080
I don't know what the fuck
they're doing.

05:02.648 --> 05:05.145
Watch what you doing,

05:05.147 --> 05:06.180
you prick.

05:07.781 --> 05:09.614
Get that cunt out of here.

05:13.081 --> 05:17.513
this is a fucking joke.

05:23.081 --> 05:25.146
- Who's there?
- It's Pat.

05:25.148 --> 05:26.513
- Pat who?
- Don't fuck about

05:26.515 --> 05:28.714
- open the door!
- Pat-a-cake?

05:30.182 --> 05:34.646
Open this fucking door
before I smash it in you cunt!

05:34.648 --> 05:35.645
I was only having a laugh.

05:35.647 --> 05:37.679
Yeah, well you ain't
fucking funny are you?

05:37.681 --> 05:39.246
- Who's this?
- Well, we caught this cunt

05:39.248 --> 05:40.779
serving Charlie in the toilet.

05:40.781 --> 05:44.145
- Please, I'm sorry.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

05:44.147 --> 05:44.812
Do you wanna have a go?

05:44.814 --> 05:47.146
No, run him through, mate.

05:47.148 --> 05:48.212
Well, I'll have a go, Tone.

05:48.214 --> 05:49.713
Have you seen it out there?

05:49.715 --> 05:51.279
It's like a fucking bomb scare.

05:51.281 --> 05:53.513
No pills, no punters.

05:53.515 --> 05:54.346
I've been trying to get some

05:54.348 --> 05:55.580
but there's nothing around,
mate.

05:55.582 --> 05:56.414
Well, we're gonna have to
fucking sort it then, ain't we.

05:56.416 --> 05:57.679
Well, we are trying to sort
it.

05:57.681 --> 06:00.678
You know what fucking winds
me up about you pair of cunts?

06:00.680 --> 06:02.846
Is all you wanna fucking
do is get on the sniff,

06:02.848 --> 06:06.583
24/7, and fuck about with
idiots.

06:07.647 --> 06:10.546
We're running low on fucking
pills.

06:10.548 --> 06:12.046
And the place is falling apart
around us.

06:12.048 --> 06:13.713
You've got to fucking sort it
out.

06:13.715 --> 06:14.582
I mean it.

06:23.249 --> 06:24.979
What's fucking wrong with Pat?

06:24.981 --> 06:29.812
He's always been a fucking
miserable cunt for weeks.

06:29.814 --> 06:30.980
Here you are mate.

06:30.982 --> 06:32.014
You finish up here.

06:32.016 --> 06:36.547
I know exactly what
Patrick needs.

06:48.248 --> 06:49.782
Oh that's nice.

06:52.047 --> 06:54.746
Do you know what that says?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.682
It says you are a cunt.

07:06.182 --> 07:08.246
- Do you want a drink Tony?
- Two vodka tonics

07:08.248 --> 07:10.179
- please, Dean.
- I'm not drinking mate.

07:10.181 --> 07:12.579
You can one fucking drink.

07:12.581 --> 07:13.514
What's the fuck the matter with
you?

07:13.516 --> 07:14.678
Tony, do me a favour,

07:14.680 --> 07:16.645
there's fucking nothing wrong
with me.

07:16.647 --> 07:18.279
Why are you acting like
such a miserable cunt then?

07:18.281 --> 07:19.413
I'm not.

07:19.415 --> 07:21.546
It's like looking
at my fucking misses mate.

07:21.548 --> 07:23.612
Look, just fucking leave it,
yeah.

07:23.614 --> 07:26.213
- Look, okay.
- For fuck's sake.

07:26.215 --> 07:29.549
Well, just stand here and sulk
then.

07:30.748 --> 07:32.549
Here's to long faces.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.482
You cunt.

07:47.047 --> 07:48.813
You slippery no good cunt.

07:48.815 --> 07:50.546
You fucked thing spiked
my drink didn't ya?

07:50.548 --> 07:54.513
Do you love them, my
best friend?

07:54.515 --> 07:58.515
It's the only way I can
get you to fucking talk.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.548
It's that cunt Harris.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.579
It's fucking killing me, I
can't stop thinking about it.

08:08.547 --> 08:10.015
Five fucking years.

08:11.780 --> 08:14.746
And he's walking around like
nothing fucking happened.

08:14.748 --> 08:16.546
If I know that cunt he's fucking
laughing

08:16.548 --> 08:18.016
about it right now.

08:19.714 --> 08:21.213
He's probably forgotten
all about it mate.

08:21.215 --> 08:24.213
Yeah well, that makes
it even fucking worse.

08:24.215 --> 08:26.148
I want him fucking bad.

08:27.315 --> 08:30.778
And I also want that cunt who
done me with a fucking hammer.

08:30.780 --> 08:32.645
You just need to fucking
knock this on the head mate,

08:32.648 --> 08:34.179
and actually have some fun.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.679
You're the only cunt I know
in the world who takes an E

08:36.681 --> 08:39.111
and still wants to kill people.

08:39.114 --> 08:40.778
Come on babe.

09:48.747 --> 09:53.748
Pat the fucking hard man.

10:00.181 --> 10:02.246
As far as the fucking Spanish
old bill is concerned,

10:02.248 --> 10:04.213
they love it when gangsters
start killing one another.

10:51.548 --> 10:52.216
Oi!

10:55.214 --> 10:57.216
Where the fuck's Harris?

10:59.515 --> 11:00.849
Can I help you?

11:05.681 --> 11:08.112
I've come here for Harris.

11:08.114 --> 11:08.982
Who?

11:10.148 --> 11:12.213
Frank fucking Harris.

11:12.215 --> 11:13.212
I've never heard of him.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.812
Never heard of him,
he fucking lives here.

11:14.814 --> 11:16.079
He doesn't, I live here.

11:16.081 --> 11:18.482
- For how long?
- Two years.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.681
Two years.

11:23.814 --> 11:24.682
Fuck.

11:29.681 --> 11:31.813
I, I don't know what to say, I'm
so sorry.

11:31.815 --> 11:34.212
I am so sorry for disturbing
your game.

11:34.214 --> 11:35.979
Got the wrong house.

11:35.981 --> 11:36.849
Okay.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.481
Excuse me.

11:43.214 --> 11:45.578
Could you call me a taxi?

12:04.081 --> 12:05.079
Can I help you mate?

12:05.081 --> 12:08.278
Yeah, looking for a
geezer called Harris.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.678
- Frank Harris.
- Never heard of him.

12:11.915 --> 12:13.782
Well, how about now?

12:14.647 --> 12:15.946
Well, I don't know anyone
called Harris.

12:15.948 --> 12:17.512
Give's that fucking back then.

12:17.514 --> 12:19.180
Jesus Christ, slow down son.

12:19.182 --> 12:20.578
I've been here 20 years

12:20.580 --> 12:21.845
and I know pretty much everyone
else.

12:21.847 --> 12:23.046
Well that's good.

12:23.048 --> 12:24.179
But it's got a little fucking
bird wrapped

12:24.181 --> 12:25.346
round him called Charlotte.

12:25.348 --> 12:29.779
Gorgeous little brunette,
you would never forget her.

12:29.781 --> 12:30.812
Yeah, a bit of a sniff-head.

12:30.814 --> 12:32.979
Yeah, fucking bang on it.

12:32.981 --> 12:35.079
Now where can I find her?

12:35.081 --> 12:36.211
She's shacked up with a geezer

12:36.213 --> 12:37.845
with a great big boat down the
port.

12:37.847 --> 12:39.745
Is that right?

12:39.747 --> 12:40.615
Yeah.

12:42.547 --> 12:43.545
Oi, I've told you what you
wanted.

12:43.547 --> 12:44.980
Do you know how many
fucking boats there are

12:44.982 --> 12:47.612
in that marina, do you?

12:47.614 --> 12:48.949
You fucking melt.

13:32.781 --> 13:34.278
Well fuck me.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.481
What a fucking surprise.

13:38.114 --> 13:40.279
Now where's fucking Harris?

13:40.281 --> 13:42.778
Now you fucking tell me where
Harris is

13:42.780 --> 13:44.046
or I'm gonna pull your fucking
wank

13:44.048 --> 13:46.649
through the back of your cunt.

13:48.115 --> 13:50.715
Let him fucking go, Patrick.

13:52.515 --> 13:53.812
What do you mean, Harris
is dead?

13:53.814 --> 13:55.545
He died two years ago mate.

13:55.547 --> 13:56.413
If you'd just fucking listen to
me

13:56.415 --> 13:57.412
and stop your going on and on
and on

13:57.414 --> 13:58.945
and shouting and screaming
at fucking people,

13:58.947 --> 13:59.813
you'd have found out.

13:59.815 --> 14:00.712
How?

14:00.714 --> 14:02.848
She fucked him to death.

14:03.914 --> 14:05.946
There are worse ways to go,
Pat.

14:05.948 --> 14:07.245
She nicked Harris' books, his
ledgers,

14:07.247 --> 14:08.679
the whole fucking lot.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.746
I just took over the fucking
empire.

14:10.748 --> 14:12.013
You know I'm looking around
here, Tel,

14:12.015 --> 14:13.979
and I'll say it again, you've
had a fucking touch ain't ya?

14:13.981 --> 14:15.279
I've had it off mate.

14:15.281 --> 14:17.245
Yeah, 'cause he's partnered up
with me.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.112
Well, now you need to
throw something my way.

14:19.114 --> 14:21.579
- Why?
- Because you fucking owe me.

14:21.581 --> 14:22.546
How do you work that out?

14:22.548 --> 14:24.578
You're the one who
made the fucking intro.

14:24.580 --> 14:26.613
You took me up into that
fucking cunt in gaff

14:26.615 --> 14:27.679
in the fucking hills.

14:27.681 --> 14:29.178
Five years in the fucking
shovel.

14:29.180 --> 14:31.178
Five years I've done for
that fucking wrong'un.

14:31.180 --> 14:35.045
So don't sit there making
fucking faces.

14:35.047 --> 14:37.545
Down to the old pal's
act, you fucking owe me.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.545
Listen mate, I'm fucking
strictly wholesale now mate.

14:39.547 --> 14:41.613
30,000 pills, minimum fucking
order.

14:41.615 --> 14:42.880
That's 40 grand Patrick.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.816
That ain't a problem.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.645
All right, I'll tell you what
I'll do.

14:49.647 --> 14:50.879
You come up with half of it up
front

14:50.881 --> 14:52.713
and I'll give you a squeeze
and give you the rest on tick.

14:52.715 --> 14:54.178
How's that?

14:54.180 --> 14:55.113
Done.

14:55.115 --> 14:57.179
Where are you gonna get 20
grand, Pat?

14:57.181 --> 15:00.745
None of your fucking
business, nose ointment.

15:11.181 --> 15:12.945
- Who's this?
- It's Pat.

15:12.947 --> 15:14.178
You finish what you started?

15:14.180 --> 15:16.612
- No mate, didn't work out.
- Probably for the best, mate.

15:16.614 --> 15:18.578
Tone, listen to me, don't
talk.

15:18.580 --> 15:21.012
I need you to get out
here lively with 20 large.

15:21.014 --> 15:23.178
Fuck off, Nigel's fight on
Saturday.

15:23.180 --> 15:24.013
I'm walking him out.

15:24.015 --> 15:25.179
Yeah, well, don't worry about
that

15:25.181 --> 15:27.745
'cause I'll get you back in
plenty of time, trust me.

15:27.747 --> 15:29.678
- I don't know Pat.
- Yeah?

15:29.680 --> 15:30.545
Well lucky I fucking do

15:30.547 --> 15:32.245
because Essex is running low on
pills

15:32.247 --> 15:34.912
and I've just made a contact
who can put us right back

15:34.914 --> 15:36.679
on top of the fucking game.

15:36.681 --> 15:39.012
- How much?
- 20 buys us 30.

15:39.014 --> 15:41.011
- Thousand?
- Fucking right.

15:41.013 --> 15:42.712
I'll see you in a couple of
days.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.880
Nice one, son, looking good.

15:50.882 --> 15:54.879
Have a drink, we'll crack
on in a minute, all right.

15:54.881 --> 15:56.011
What do you think Tone?

15:56.013 --> 15:57.778
You're gonna fucking kill him,
Nige.

15:57.780 --> 15:59.746
- Aye, aye.
- Pack a bag

15:59.748 --> 16:01.578
and a passport Rolphe,
we're going to Spain.

16:01.580 --> 16:03.613
What, what for?

16:03.615 --> 16:04.880
Don't ask just fucking do it.

16:04.882 --> 16:05.813
Keep the noise down,

16:05.815 --> 16:07.013
you're interrupting his fucking
training.

16:07.015 --> 16:11.513
Fuck me Tone, he's not much
to look at up close is he?

16:11.515 --> 16:13.546
I thought you'd be bigger.

16:13.548 --> 16:14.880
Your mate's got a big mouth.

16:14.882 --> 16:16.812
No manners Tone.

16:16.814 --> 16:18.713
Who you fucking talking to?

16:18.715 --> 16:21.144
I eat cunts like you for
breakfast.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.144
Well, how about you jump in
here

16:22.146 --> 16:24.279
and we'll find out then.

16:27.014 --> 16:28.845
I ain't gonna hurt him
before his fight am I?

16:28.847 --> 16:32.713
You ain't even gonna
touch him son?

16:34.113 --> 16:35.181
'Gin, 'gin.

16:37.780 --> 16:41.112
Don't block him, oh knock him
out.

16:43.681 --> 16:48.044
Hit him, that's it.

16:48.046 --> 16:50.211
Come on Rolphe, hit him.

16:50.213 --> 16:51.615
Give it to him.

16:52.413 --> 16:54.044
Knock him out, Rolphe,
go on, knock him out.

16:57.114 --> 16:58.212
How's he gonna win a fight,
yeah,

16:58.214 --> 16:59.778
if he don't throw any punches?

17:12.180 --> 17:13.712
Is he fucking snoring?

17:13.714 --> 17:16.848
No mate, he's swallowing his
tongue.

17:19.848 --> 17:20.713
Fair play.

17:38.147 --> 17:40.279
Charlotte, it's 11 o'clock
in the fucking morning,

17:40.281 --> 17:41.948
what are you doing?

19:50.080 --> 19:51.978
Don't let no cunt know where you

19:51.980 --> 19:53.646
There's always someone gonna

Yeah, yeah we did.

24:22.679 --> 24:25.279

24:25.281 --> 24:27.844

24:37.913 --> 24:38.745
Now what am I doing?

24:38.747 --> 24:41.012

way.

24:41.014 --> 24:43.611

24:57.680 --> 24:59.844

25:27.881 --> 25:30.944

26:13.181 --> 26:14.048

26:33.114 --> 26:35.448
I'm fucking hallucinating.

26:36.913 --> 26:38.212
While you were talking,
I just heard him say

26:38.214 --> 26:39.645
we're going to fucking
Amsterdam.

26:39.647 --> 26:41.545
Nah nah, you did.

26:41.547 --> 26:42.511

- Well, we're going

26:42.513 --> 26:44.246

26:44.248 --> 26:46.279
What are you on about, we're
going to fucking Amsterdam?

26:46.281 --> 26:48.079
You silly fucking cunt.

26:48.081 --> 26:49.644
Look, the flights were cheap

26:49.646 --> 26:50.612
and there was a connecting
flight.

26:50.614 --> 26:52.745
We're going to be in Spain in
the morning.

26:52.747 --> 26:56.212
Look, this way, we can have
a night out in Amsterdam.

26:56.214 --> 26:58.212
You're not as
fucking silly

26:58.214 --> 26:59.912
as you look are you?

26:59.914 --> 27:00.777
You're still a cunt, though,
argh.

27:00.779 --> 27:01.647
Argh!

27:09.747 --> 27:11.246
One of Terry's clients.

27:11.248 --> 27:13.544
Thinks he doesn't wanna
work with us no more.

27:13.546 --> 27:16.814
So we're gonna help him change
his mind.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.678
Pick a tool lad.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.844
Woo, woo, woo, the day
I need a fucking shooter

27:22.846 --> 27:27.577
to change someone's mind is
the day I fucking retire.

27:27.579 --> 27:28.878
So watch and learn.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.014
Fair enough.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.512
Now you fucking listen to me
Stevie.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.578
- Pat.
- And you listen fucking good.

28:04.580 --> 28:05.545
Terry Fisher's a fucking pal of
mine

28:05.547 --> 28:07.211
and you do not fuck about with
him get it?

28:07.213 --> 28:08.678
- Pat.
- What do you fucking want?

28:08.680 --> 28:10.045
That's not Fat Stevie.

28:10.047 --> 28:10.978
Are you fucking mad?

28:10.980 --> 28:15.011
- Look at the size of him.
- Stevie's fatter.

28:15.013 --> 28:16.112
So where's your boss?

28:16.114 --> 28:17.545
I don't know, check the
office.

28:20.081 --> 28:21.712
All right Dave, you wanker.

28:21.714 --> 28:24.111
What are you
even doing here, Ricky?

28:24.113 --> 28:25.811
Delivering a fucking message.

28:25.813 --> 28:27.944
And you didn't want to
bring the fucking guns.

28:27.946 --> 28:29.711
Oh come on, all of these
fucking sillies just...

28:29.713 --> 28:32.978
Ugh.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.878

You fuck.

Let's go.

29:23.946 --> 29:24.814
Let's go!

29:26.713 --> 29:27.945
Where are you going?

29:27.947 --> 29:28.812
Where are you going?

29:30.847 --> 29:31.714
You mugs.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.711
Can you walk?

29:43.713 --> 29:46.078
That's a fucking stupid
question to ask.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.645
Of course I can't fucking walk.

29:47.647 --> 29:48.848
Look at my leg.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.711
- Help me up mate.
- Give me your hand.

29:53.881 --> 29:54.748
Come up.

29:56.247 --> 29:58.512
Now you listen to me.

29:58.514 --> 30:03.078
You my friend, you're gonna
be all right.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.612
We'll get you walking in no
time.

30:04.614 --> 30:05.278
Thanks mate.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.678
Argh!

30:08.280 --> 30:09.212
You should've fucking dumped
me

30:09.214 --> 30:10.912
when you had the chance you
woman cunt.

31:33.980 --> 31:35.979
- What do you mean he's dead?
- They fucking killed him,

31:35.981 --> 31:36.979
cut his throat.

31:36.981 --> 31:37.979
Who?

31:37.981 --> 31:39.879
I don't know, there
was five or six of them.

31:39.881 --> 31:41.245
All I can remember is Dave
screaming

31:41.247 --> 31:44.778
out some fucking geezer's name,
Ricky.

31:44.780 --> 31:47.011
Oh fucking hell, no.

31:47.013 --> 31:48.245
Now, Tel, you've gotta tell me

31:48.247 --> 31:52.981
what's fucking going on here,
'cause I nearly got killed.

31:53.313 --> 31:55.845
It's this fucking geezer
called Greener.

31:55.847 --> 31:57.744
He been trying to take out my
business for the last year.

31:57.746 --> 31:58.612
Yeah, and it looks like he's
gonna

31:58.614 --> 31:59.812
fucking do it, done it?

31:59.814 --> 32:00.679
What are you being like that
for?

32:00.681 --> 32:02.911
Because it's the fucking truth
innit?

32:02.913 --> 32:05.744
I mean with Dave out the way
you're fucking fair game.

32:05.746 --> 32:06.811
You've gotta remember something
Tel,

32:06.813 --> 32:09.577
you're a fucking middle
man, you ain't a villain.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.978
And I'm telling you now,
they will take your business,

32:11.980 --> 32:15.043
and you'll end up dead in a
fucking hole.

32:15.045 --> 32:17.944
Don't you think I
fucking don't know that.

32:17.946 --> 32:19.143
You gotta help me mate.

32:19.145 --> 32:22.611
Don't make your problems my
problems.

32:22.613 --> 32:23.512
Listen, I'll pay you.

32:23.514 --> 32:25.513
You'd fucking have to.

32:28.747 --> 32:29.681
How much?

32:31.913 --> 32:35.644
I tell you what, you wipe
the tick off the gear I owe,

32:35.646 --> 32:36.878
and I'll make sure every cunt

32:36.880 --> 32:40.544
in Marbella knows not to fuck
with you.

32:40.546 --> 32:41.411
Oh woo woo woo woo woo,

32:41.413 --> 32:43.878
don't start making them fucking
faces.

32:43.880 --> 32:44.812
I know exactly what you're
thinking.

32:44.814 --> 32:47.777
Don't even fucking
dream about haggling me.

32:47.779 --> 32:50.043
You make sure you
deliver me that 20 grand,

32:50.045 --> 32:52.811
and I'll wipe out the rest of
it, deal?

32:52.813 --> 32:53.880
Yeah, done.

32:56.547 --> 32:59.512
So what do you wanna do,
how do you wanna play this?

32:59.514 --> 33:01.177
We're flopping that cunt's
restaurant,

33:01.179 --> 33:02.714
and we show face.

33:03.714 --> 33:04.848
Are you ready?

33:06.212 --> 33:07.077
You look good, babes.

33:07.079 --> 33:07.947
I know.

33:12.179 --> 33:13.513
Now I'm ready.

33:15.145 --> 33:17.977
Are you fucking for real?

33:17.979 --> 33:20.611
Have you got any idea
what's going on here?

33:20.613 --> 33:22.244
They could take everything
we've ever worked for.

33:22.246 --> 33:24.678
Hmm, let's go show these
cunts what we're made of then.

33:38.112 --> 33:38.979
Relax.

33:41.045 --> 33:43.979
Heads up, that's them over
there.

33:51.847 --> 33:53.114
Do me a favour.

33:54.145 --> 33:56.644
Get rid of that cunt.

33:56.646 --> 33:58.144
No worries.

34:19.514 --> 34:21.610
You're not welcome here, Fisher.

34:21.612 --> 34:22.811
That's fucking very brave.

34:22.813 --> 34:24.612
My money not good enough for
you?

34:24.614 --> 34:26.944
Why don't you go and fuck off
home.

34:26.946 --> 34:29.777
You should watch your
fucking mouth sunshine.

34:29.779 --> 34:31.909
Now why would I wanna do that?

34:31.911 --> 34:33.677
You see, I heard your pal, Dave,

34:33.679 --> 34:35.944
had himself a little accident
today.

34:35.946 --> 34:38.712
How long do you think
you're gonna survive here

34:38.714 --> 34:40.110
without your gorilla?

34:40.112 --> 34:42.043
Well, don't you worry about
that.

34:42.045 --> 34:44.944
'Cause I've just replaced him
with a yeti.

34:44.946 --> 34:45.612
Yeti?

34:45.614 --> 34:49.844
Argh!

34:49.846 --> 34:51.177
Stop screaming or I'll
take the fucking fork

34:51.179 --> 34:54.511
out your hand and I'll put it in
your eye.

34:54.513 --> 34:58.848
Now shut up because people
are trying to fucking eat.

35:01.980 --> 35:05.612
Now do us all a favour, and fuck
off.

35:05.614 --> 35:06.878
Argh!

35:06.880 --> 35:10.611
Ah ugh, argh.

35:10.613 --> 35:13.681
Argh!

35:19.647 --> 35:21.712
Excuse me, waitress.

35:21.714 --> 35:22.844
You couldn't change that
fork for me, could you,

35:22.846 --> 35:24.581
it's fucking filthy.

35:27.614 --> 35:29.079
Thank-you, gracias.

35:33.846 --> 35:35.844
Who am I looking at?

35:35.846 --> 35:37.011
That's Mark Greener.

35:37.013 --> 35:39.611
A south London firm, heavy duty.

35:39.613 --> 35:41.011
They look like a pair of cunts
to me.

35:41.013 --> 35:42.677
Yeah but they killed Dave.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.777
Do you think we made our
point?

35:50.779 --> 35:52.781
- Yeah.
- Let's fuck off.

35:53.946 --> 35:58.014
Come on then.

36:03.647 --> 36:06.778
What are you pair of cunts
still fucking looking at hey?

36:06.780 --> 36:08.143
Do you want what he got,

36:08.145 --> 36:10.011
'cause you can fucking
have it if you want it.

36:10.013 --> 36:12.480
- Try me.
- Hey, hey hey hey!

36:13.146 --> 36:15.613
I don't see the point, mate.

36:16.912 --> 36:19.776
Now when we could be working
together.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.843
You been in Marbella what?

36:21.845 --> 36:22.980
Two days, Pat.

36:23.845 --> 36:27.110
So don't give me any
bullshit about loyalty.

36:27.112 --> 36:28.878
As far as I'm concerned
you're just a free agent

36:28.880 --> 36:31.877
available to the highest bidder.

36:31.879 --> 36:35.978
And what the fuck
would you want with me?

36:36.648 --> 36:39.047
I er, I wanna make a bid.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.044
Pat's gonna fucking kills us.

36:57.046 --> 36:57.876
Hey Tone, just tell Pat

36:57.878 --> 36:59.178
we couldn't get a connecting
flight.

36:59.180 --> 37:00.944
Look, what else are we gonna do?

37:00.946 --> 37:03.612
You can explain it to him,
you booked the fucking flights.

37:03.614 --> 37:04.978
We both got on the plane,
Tone.

37:04.980 --> 37:06.611
You fucking soppy cunt.

37:06.613 --> 37:07.479
We're walking around fucking
Holland

37:07.481 --> 37:09.144
with a bag full of cash we can't
spend.

37:09.146 --> 37:10.143
We didn't pack no fucking
clothes,

37:10.145 --> 37:11.777
we've got no fucking gear,

37:11.779 --> 37:13.844
and the flight's not until
tomorrow fucking morning!

37:13.846 --> 37:15.678
What we supposed to fucking do?

37:15.680 --> 37:16.644
Fucking what?

37:16.646 --> 37:18.644
Look, Tone, there's naked
girls up there

37:18.646 --> 37:19.843
and they're looking at us.

37:19.845 --> 37:22.811
Well, of course they fucking
are, they're prostitutes.

37:22.813 --> 37:24.278
- Look, oh fucking hell.
- Look at that fat arse

37:24.280 --> 37:25.977
on it, look at the fat arse on
it.

37:25.979 --> 37:27.644
That short one, the one
that looks like a fella,

37:27.646 --> 37:28.645
with the adam's apple.

37:28.647 --> 37:33.011
Yeah, Rolphe, peal me
off some of that cash.

37:33.013 --> 37:34.612
Here's some.

37:34.614 --> 37:36.743
Let's go get some fucking
pussy!

37:36.745 --> 37:38.844
Ah, fuck, look after my neck
you faggot.

37:53.180 --> 37:55.143
I don't know what it is about
Amsterdam,

37:55.145 --> 37:59.244
but all I wanna do is
fuck brasses any day.

38:03.146 --> 38:05.877
- Stop it!
- Woo hoo, woo hoo.

38:05.879 --> 38:07.644
- Listen, listen...
- Bye, bye.

38:07.646 --> 38:09.144
That was a fucking geezer.

38:09.146 --> 38:12.512
Adam's apple, stubble,
definitely a fucking geezer.

38:12.514 --> 38:13.677
No no, bollocks mate.

38:13.679 --> 38:16.244
She just had those sort of
manly features, that's all.

38:16.246 --> 38:18.077
- She wasn't a man.
- Big hands and big feet.

38:22.945 --> 38:25.177
It's not funny Tone.

38:25.179 --> 38:29.245
It's not funny at all.

38:32.279 --> 38:34.512
Here here, Tone, Tone

38:34.514 --> 38:35.178
do you think they're a couple of
brasses?

38:35.180 --> 38:36.111
I don't know.

38:36.113 --> 38:37.511
There's only one way to find
out, Rolphe,

38:37.513 --> 38:39.177
fucking ask them.

38:39.179 --> 38:41.643
Excuse me, excuse me, darling,

38:41.645 --> 38:44.113
can you come here a sec please?

38:48.845 --> 38:50.113
Are you a brass?

38:53.646 --> 38:55.914
Fuck off you little creep.

38:56.612 --> 38:57.478
I don't know what you're
laughing at.

38:57.480 --> 39:00.078
You're like the fucking Honey
Monster.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.910
All right, fair play, fair
play.

39:01.912 --> 39:04.811
Trust us to get the only
two fucking Essex birds

39:04.813 --> 39:06.110
in the whole of Amsterdam.

39:06.112 --> 39:07.844
Yeah we are Essex and what?

39:07.846 --> 39:09.578
Look, look, no offence babe,

39:09.580 --> 39:10.577
we only wanna have a good night.

39:10.579 --> 39:11.943
Come, come sit down and
have a drink with us.

39:11.945 --> 39:15.078
- Come on, park yourself.
- Come on.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.014
Babe, couple of drinks.

39:34.812 --> 39:37.877
- Fucking hell.
- Hurry up love,

39:37.879 --> 39:40.878
we ain't got all fucking night.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.080
Rolphe, do one.

39:49.913 --> 39:52.810
Rolphe, you selfish cunt!

40:03.514 --> 40:04.577
- Who's that?
- Who do you think it

40:04.579 --> 40:06.043
- fucking is?
- I was wondering

40:06.045 --> 40:07.610
if you'd call.

40:07.612 --> 40:09.644
- What do you want?
- Same thing as you Pat.

40:09.646 --> 40:12.211
Easy life, pocket full of
readies.

40:12.213 --> 40:14.144
- Well I'm listening.
- Why don't you drop by

40:14.146 --> 40:16.677
the restaurant in an hour.

40:17.546 --> 40:18.210
Listen, it ain't as easy as
that.

40:18.212 --> 40:19.278
I've got a fucking man down.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.811
I can't just keep fucking
sort, hold on a minute.

40:22.813 --> 40:24.214
You all right Pat?

40:34.880 --> 40:35.780
Morning.

40:37.045 --> 40:38.577
You're blocking my sun.

40:38.579 --> 40:40.711
Are you fucking mad,
the sun's over there.

40:40.713 --> 40:43.044
Worth a try.

40:45.113 --> 40:48.181
They're rented, just like his
villas.

40:50.712 --> 40:52.878
Fuck me, you are
starting early aren't you?

40:52.880 --> 40:54.278
Or finishing late.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.044
I haven't been to bed, babes.

40:56.046 --> 40:57.710
You wanna join me for some
breakfast?

40:57.712 --> 41:01.580
Well that is a silly
fucking question isn't.

41:08.546 --> 41:10.877
So what's the deal with you and
Terry?

41:10.879 --> 41:12.511
With me?

41:12.513 --> 41:14.245
It's strictly business.

41:14.247 --> 41:18.111
Well that's good, 'cause I
ain't gonna be around long.

41:18.113 --> 41:21.144
Yeah, I could've guessed that.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.178
Terry's going down, Charlotte,

41:23.180 --> 41:25.911
and you don't have to
fucking go down with him.

41:25.913 --> 41:26.977
I've seen the way he fucking
looks at you,

41:26.979 --> 41:29.776
talks to you, touches you,
and I'm telling you now,

41:29.778 --> 41:32.543
the first fucking chance he
gets, he's gonna put a bit blade

41:32.545 --> 41:33.544
in your fucking back.

41:34.646 --> 41:35.611
What you laughing at?

41:35.613 --> 41:39.211
Well, you men are all the
fucking same.

41:39.213 --> 41:41.144
He's planning the exact same
thing on you.

41:41.146 --> 41:43.078
He's gonna rob you blind, Pat.

41:45.180 --> 41:46.911
Slippery little cunt.

41:46.913 --> 41:47.780
Oh yeah.

41:50.113 --> 41:52.077
So what's in his safe?

41:52.079 --> 41:55.278
Money, drugs, fuck knows what
else.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.710
But it's enough to make
it worth our while.

41:57.712 --> 41:59.580
And where's the key?

42:02.546 --> 42:04.576
Right this is what we're gonna
do.

42:04.578 --> 42:06.177
You're gonna go to graft
and you're gonna get

42:06.179 --> 42:08.278
that fucking key no matter what
you do,

42:08.280 --> 42:10.643
and I'll take care of Terry.

42:10.645 --> 42:12.744
What do you mean "Take care of
Terry"?

42:12.746 --> 42:15.014
What do you fucking think?

42:32.080 --> 42:33.043
Come in Pat.

42:33.045 --> 42:34.446
Close the door.

42:44.745 --> 42:45.746
Take a seat.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.776
So, how's Marbella treating you?

42:52.778 --> 42:54.044
No, I ain't fucking
come here for small talk.

42:54.046 --> 42:55.610
What do you want?

42:55.612 --> 42:57.911
Okay, straight to business.

42:57.913 --> 42:58.910
How long you gonna be in town?

42:58.912 --> 43:02.043
None of your fucking
business knows wants.

43:02.045 --> 43:02.877
'Cause I'm hoping you're gonna
jump

43:02.879 --> 43:04.576
on the first flight back to
Essex.

43:04.578 --> 43:06.710
And why would I do
what you fucking want?

43:06.712 --> 43:08.710
'Cause you're gonna have no
choice.

43:08.712 --> 43:11.144
Now, I'm gonna need you to
pay very very close attention

43:11.146 --> 43:14.078
to what I'm about to show you.

43:14.080 --> 43:19.044
I'm very excited
about this.

43:19.046 --> 43:21.011
This is fucking gold.

43:38.778 --> 43:40.043
It's incredible isn't it.

43:40.045 --> 43:42.043
You know, the clarity that you
can get on people's faces now

43:42.045 --> 43:43.979
it's just, its amazing.

43:46.213 --> 43:49.043
Now this is my favourite part.

43:49.045 --> 43:52.113
Watch this, wait for it, wait
for it.

43:54.880 --> 43:58.710
Oh ho ho, my god,

43:58.712 --> 44:01.843
you really are a vicious
bastard, aren't you, Pat.

44:01.845 --> 44:02.846
Here, catch.

44:04.247 --> 44:06.677
You see, I've got this
coza, he works for me.

44:06.679 --> 44:07.977
And he managed to snag that
before

44:07.979 --> 44:10.111
anyone's had a chance to see it.

44:10.113 --> 44:12.143
How many copies have you got
of this?

44:12.145 --> 44:13.810
Just the one.

44:13.812 --> 44:16.743
So where's the original?

44:16.745 --> 44:19.178
Locked up, in there.

44:19.180 --> 44:22.244
Well let me tell you
something, you flash cunt.

44:22.246 --> 44:23.743
I ain't fucking going
nowhere until you get

44:23.745 --> 44:26.510
that fucking tape out the safe.

44:26.512 --> 44:29.580
- So get your fucking...
- No no, no Pat.

44:31.045 --> 44:33.811
We both know that's
not how this plays out.

44:33.813 --> 44:35.576
Now I'm guessing you didn't tell

44:35.578 --> 44:38.511
anyone you were coming
here today, am I right?

44:38.513 --> 44:39.979
Yeah, I thought so.

44:40.913 --> 44:42.978
So, it would be very easy
just to make you disappear

44:42.980 --> 44:47.447
and I bet no one would give
a fuck that you're gone.

44:48.646 --> 44:51.277
So this is the last warning
you're gonna get from me mate.

44:51.279 --> 44:54.110
Go home, pack your shit, and get
the fuck

44:54.112 --> 44:55.710
out of Marbella tonight.

44:55.712 --> 44:59.044
Now, let's just fucking
take a breath here.

44:59.046 --> 45:00.777
I got a little bit more
business to take care of

45:00.779 --> 45:02.010
in the next couple of days.

45:02.012 --> 45:06.712
If you let me do that business,
then I'll fuck off for good.

45:07.446 --> 45:09.277
I swear to you, I swear on
my baby daughter's life,

45:09.279 --> 45:10.546
I'll be gone.

45:14.045 --> 45:16.712
Okay, two days Pat, two days.

45:21.579 --> 45:24.978
But if you're not gone, then
that tape's gonna find it's way

45:24.980 --> 45:26.844
into the hands of the old bill,

45:26.846 --> 45:31.643
and you're gonna spend 25
years in a Spanish nick.

45:31.645 --> 45:33.010
Now you can keep that.

45:33.012 --> 45:34.479
It's a souvenir.

45:35.646 --> 45:36.777
Well go on, fuck off.

45:36.779 --> 45:37.713
Fuck off.

45:44.212 --> 45:48.544
Hmm, hmm.

45:48.546 --> 45:50.547
Where are you, you cunt?

45:59.112 --> 46:00.244
Who the fuck's this?

46:00.246 --> 46:02.210
It's Pat, where the fuck are
you?

46:02.212 --> 46:04.277
- Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam!

46:04.279 --> 46:06.178
What the cunt are you
doing in fucking Amsterdam?

46:06.180 --> 46:07.643
Keep your fucking hair on Pat,

46:07.645 --> 46:09.144
we got a flight to Malaga.

46:09.146 --> 46:10.946
- What time?
- Rolphe?

46:11.779 --> 46:14.676
What time have we got the flight
booked?

46:14.678 --> 46:16.743
Er, quarter past nine.

46:16.745 --> 46:18.077
We've got to be there for eight.

46:18.079 --> 46:19.011
Quarter past nine.

46:19.013 --> 46:20.012
What are you talking about,
you cunt,

46:20.014 --> 46:22.744
- it's fucking half 10!
- What, are you serious?

46:22.746 --> 46:25.277
It's fucking half 10!

46:25.279 --> 46:27.877
You pair of soppy cunts, you've
missed the fucking flight.

46:27.879 --> 46:29.946
We'll book another one.

46:31.179 --> 46:32.710
Look Tone, listen to me.

46:32.712 --> 46:34.877
I need you out here, I
need you fucking out here,

46:34.879 --> 46:36.210
because it's come on top.

46:36.212 --> 46:39.043
Relax, we'll be there
soon.

46:39.045 --> 46:40.978
Just fucking hurry up.

46:40.980 --> 46:43.846
All right, all right, all
right.

46:45.613 --> 46:46.479
Rolphe?

46:49.179 --> 46:51.711
Rolphe, go book us a flight.

46:51.713 --> 46:53.011
What did your last slave die
of?

46:53.013 --> 46:56.746
Not booking me a
fucking flight, you cunt.

47:08.211 --> 47:11.210
It's all fucked
Tone.

47:11.212 --> 47:13.044
All the flights are double
booked.

47:13.046 --> 47:15.544
We ain't gonna get a flight
until the day after tomorrow.

47:15.546 --> 47:17.014
You fucking cunt.

47:20.246 --> 47:23.047
We'll have to fucking rent a
car.

47:24.746 --> 47:26.644
We should just fucking nick
one.

47:26.646 --> 47:28.843
You know how to hot
wire a car now do you?

47:28.845 --> 47:31.712
Well, it's worth giving it a
go.

47:56.612 --> 47:57.611
What the fuck!

48:10.979 --> 48:13.011
Tone, Tone,

48:13.013 --> 48:15.676
looks like someone had a bit
more beer than us last night.

48:15.678 --> 48:16.744
Fucking sweet.

48:27.512 --> 48:29.510
- Where the fuck you been?
- I've been out.

48:29.512 --> 48:30.777
- Where?
- What are you,

48:30.779 --> 48:32.110
fucking old bill?

48:32.112 --> 48:35.743
Just remember who you
fucking work for Pat.

48:35.745 --> 48:37.710
Don't matter, come, I
gotta go.

48:37.712 --> 48:38.844
I'm gonna be fucking late.

48:38.846 --> 48:40.577
Well, where are we going?

48:40.579 --> 48:42.914
Golf, and get them and all.

48:44.178 --> 48:47.579
You're taking the
fucking piss.

49:02.745 --> 49:06.042
- Sidders.
- What are you doing here?

49:06.044 --> 49:08.844
I've been calling you
all fucking day mate.

49:08.846 --> 49:10.243
I've been busy ain't I.

49:10.245 --> 49:11.611
I've got another
package coming tomorrow.

49:11.613 --> 49:12.545
Are you ready?

49:12.547 --> 49:14.978
No, I just can't swing that
now mate.

49:14.980 --> 49:16.077
Hold on a minute, we had a
deal, mate.

49:16.079 --> 49:18.043
You take everything I got.

49:18.045 --> 49:20.577
Yeah, but that was then, this
is now.

49:20.579 --> 49:22.243
Have you been talking to
the other side have you?

49:22.245 --> 49:24.042
I'll talk to who the fuck I
like to.

49:24.044 --> 49:25.045
Yeah, Pat?

49:29.246 --> 49:30.610
Yeah, who the fuck's this?

49:30.612 --> 49:33.910
Don't worry about him, he's my
caddy.

49:33.912 --> 49:35.579
What do you reckon?

49:36.313 --> 49:39.576
Well, if it was me I'd
use a wood or a long iron.

49:39.578 --> 49:44.113
You know what, I tell you
what, I'll go with the wood.

49:45.545 --> 49:46.546
Do you mind?

49:55.879 --> 49:58.577
The thing is Sidney, you work
for me mate,

49:58.579 --> 49:59.846
and no one else.

50:00.812 --> 50:01.777
You know, the thing is Terry,

50:01.779 --> 50:03.244
I work for who the fuck I like.

50:03.246 --> 50:06.743
Word is you're fucking
finished out here anyway.

50:06.745 --> 50:07.612
That so?

50:13.111 --> 50:14.942
You can't get that kind
of prop round the cap.

50:14.944 --> 50:17.076
That's what I'm good at.

50:28.578 --> 50:29.243
Look at my fucking face.

50:29.245 --> 50:30.511
Get your hands fucking back.

50:30.513 --> 50:32.577
Now look at my face, you cunt.

50:32.579 --> 50:34.142
- Now remember...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:34.144 --> 50:36.077
Do not forget this face,
'cause if I hear you're

50:36.079 --> 50:38.510
fucking dealing with Greener
again,

50:38.512 --> 50:39.910
and you're fucking dead.

50:39.912 --> 50:42.676
- You got me?
- Yeah, yes.

50:42.678 --> 50:46.576
For god's sake.

50:46.578 --> 50:50.177
Argh!

50:50.179 --> 50:52.512
- Now play on.
- Thank-you.

51:01.846 --> 51:03.543
Argh!

51:03.545 --> 51:05.577
- What the fuck was that?
- You just hit

51:05.579 --> 51:07.077
- that geezer right in the back.
- Jesus, bastard, bollocks.

51:07.079 --> 51:09.077
Well come on, let's fuck off.

51:09.079 --> 51:10.277
Oh fuck he's heading to the golf
cart.

51:10.279 --> 51:12.543
Shut up you mug,

51:12.545 --> 51:16.244
fucking talk to yourself, you
soppy cunt.

51:16.246 --> 51:19.811
Ah you fucking, fucking woman,
shut up.

51:19.813 --> 51:22.143
Oh no, the cunt's coming over.

51:22.145 --> 51:24.009
All right, stop stop stop stop.

51:24.011 --> 51:25.843
Stop stop stop.

51:25.845 --> 51:28.009
Oi, what you talking
about?

51:28.011 --> 51:29.810
How can you hit a golf
ball when I'm on the green?

51:29.812 --> 51:31.611
I didn't even fucking hit the
ball.

51:31.613 --> 51:33.109
He did, the geezer sitting in
the buggy.

51:33.111 --> 51:34.909
- Him?
- He did, yeah.

51:44.647 --> 51:47.109
- Pass me the roadmap Rolphe?
- What?

51:47.111 --> 51:48.977
The fucking
roadmap you silly cunt!

51:48.979 --> 51:50.977
- Oh!
- Oh you fucking mug,

51:50.979 --> 51:52.276
it's in fucking Dutch!

51:52.278 --> 51:53.777
No wonder we're fucking lost!

52:01.944 --> 52:02.810
- Cheer Tel.
- Don't you think we

52:02.812 --> 52:05.010
should have a little toast to
Dave?

52:05.012 --> 52:07.644
I am not drinking to that
cunt.

52:07.646 --> 52:08.710
Listen, if he'd been
good at his fucking job,

52:08.712 --> 52:10.910
he would've been here
with us now, wouldn't he.

52:10.912 --> 52:12.610
That is beautiful.

52:12.612 --> 52:14.811
Maybe you can give a
speech at his funeral.

52:14.813 --> 52:17.076
If you keep on at me,
it'll be your funeral next.

52:17.078 --> 52:20.277
You better not be threatening
me.

52:20.279 --> 52:23.547
How about you fuck off, how's
that?

52:26.246 --> 52:28.046
I'm going for a piss.

52:33.212 --> 52:34.909
I'm in.

52:34.911 --> 52:38.710
No one threatens me, stupid shit
cunt.

52:38.712 --> 52:40.910
You just need to find that
key.

53:47.912 --> 53:50.842
Watch out, watch out, watch
out!

53:50.844 --> 53:53.776
Sorry mate, I'm
fucking falling asleep here.

53:53.778 --> 53:56.176
Just pull over mate, get your
nut down.

53:56.178 --> 53:57.577
I haven't got fucking time.

53:57.579 --> 53:59.577
Just pull over.

53:59.579 --> 54:00.876
All right.

54:05.011 --> 54:06.110
Rolphe, go and have a look in
the back,

54:06.112 --> 54:08.142
see if we can get some
fucking coffee or something.

54:08.144 --> 54:12.812
Ah, shit, all right.

54:14.011 --> 54:16.910
There's some er crisps.

54:16.912 --> 54:18.580
Fuck off, crisps.

54:19.479 --> 54:21.511
I need something to keep
me awake you silly cunt.

54:21.513 --> 54:22.180
Cereal.

54:24.679 --> 54:28.677
Ah, wait a minute Tone,
wait a minute Tone.

54:28.679 --> 54:33.678
Aye, aye, we've only rung the
fucking bell Tone.

54:36.145 --> 54:37.213
Jesus Christ.

54:40.745 --> 54:42.746
Christ Tone, Tone, Tone.

54:45.178 --> 54:46.842
What are you doing in my van?

54:46.844 --> 54:47.943
Look I didn't know it was your
mate.

54:47.945 --> 54:49.244
I, I swear.

54:49.246 --> 54:50.644
But you were stealing it, yes?

54:50.646 --> 54:51.810
I, I found the keys in it.

54:51.812 --> 54:54.109
And now you're stealing my
narcotics.

54:54.111 --> 54:55.743
No, we're just borrowing them.

54:55.745 --> 54:57.909
Listen mate, we ain't
stealing your fucking van.

54:57.911 --> 54:59.710
We've got somewhere we need to
be.

54:59.712 --> 55:01.276
And if you behave your fucking
self,

55:01.278 --> 55:02.877
you can have it back when we're
done.

55:02.879 --> 55:04.610
What if I don't behave myself?

55:04.612 --> 55:09.743
We'll turn you upside down
and gut you like a fucking pig.

55:09.745 --> 55:12.809
Okay, where is it we're going?

55:12.811 --> 55:15.577
- Marbella.
- Ah, Marbella.

55:15.579 --> 55:16.979
What is your name?

55:18.011 --> 55:18.878
Tone.

55:20.079 --> 55:22.013
- Tony?
- No, I'm Craig.

55:23.979 --> 55:26.077
- Tony Craig?
- Listen you cunt,

55:26.079 --> 55:28.809
my name's Tony, his name's
Craig.

55:28.811 --> 55:31.110
Okay, we have a long journey.

55:31.112 --> 55:34.176
Perhaps I should roll us a jazz
cigarette.

55:34.178 --> 55:36.043
Well fuck that mate,
we want something lively.

55:36.045 --> 55:38.046
We're fucking knackered.

55:40.645 --> 55:42.142
I have some nice crack in
here.

55:43.644 --> 55:45.076
Tone, what's he doing?

55:45.078 --> 55:47.611
I think he's a bit iffy mate.

55:57.878 --> 55:59.642
- Who's iffy?
- You, you cunt.

55:59.644 --> 56:01.742
Give me a pipe with
that fucking thing here.

56:01.744 --> 56:04.946
I'm iffy?

56:06.978 --> 56:08.176
I'm iffy.

56:08.178 --> 56:11.010
Well he's fucking iffy, but
you're double iffy Rolphe.

56:11.012 --> 56:14.177
You're next, son.

56:21.711 --> 56:24.042
- You're iffy.
- I'm not iffy.

56:24.044 --> 56:27.778
I'm just a cake.

56:30.546 --> 56:31.812
I'm just a cake.

56:59.279 --> 57:00.146
Pat?

58:12.745 --> 58:14.679
Who the fuck are you?

58:15.644 --> 58:17.843
- Da da!
- Woop di doo!

58:17.845 --> 58:21.210
We fucking made it Patrick.

58:21.212 --> 58:23.576
Where the fuck you two's been,
hey?

58:23.578 --> 58:25.077
Fucking state of you,
what have you been taking?

58:25.079 --> 58:28.076
Er, just a little something
to keep the drive all sweet.

58:28.078 --> 58:29.976
And who the fuck's this
long'un.

58:29.978 --> 58:31.445
This is Klaus.

58:32.179 --> 58:35.076
I fucking love you Klaus.

58:35.078 --> 58:35.943
He would love.

58:37.577 --> 58:40.042
I'm feeling much love for you
also.

58:40.044 --> 58:43.010
If you ever come to Essex,
make sure you look us up.

58:43.012 --> 58:45.909
That is an offer I would
consider most sincerely.

58:45.911 --> 58:46.943
Oh, this is your bag.

58:46.945 --> 58:50.277
Thank-you Klaus

58:50.279 --> 58:53.510
Thank-you.

58:53.512 --> 58:56.775
Fucking diamond geezer, one of
your own.

58:56.777 --> 58:57.742
Yeah, fucking looks it.

58:57.744 --> 58:58.877
Right, let's get some breakfast.

58:58.879 --> 59:00.142
Can I have an ice-cream?

59:00.144 --> 59:00.978
Yum.

59:03.211 --> 59:05.942
Fuck off Tone!

59:05.944 --> 59:07.675
For fuck's sake.

59:07.677 --> 59:10.743
Fucking state of you two
cunts.

59:10.745 --> 59:14.013
If you could see your fucking
faces now.

59:16.079 --> 59:17.043
Pass me that bag up.

59:17.045 --> 59:20.746
Let me count the readies
while you're eating.

59:21.812 --> 59:24.212
It's all in the bag Patrick.

59:35.845 --> 59:36.842
What's this?

59:36.844 --> 59:40.809
It's money, what does
it fucking look like?

59:57.845 --> 59:59.542
I thought he was our fucking
mate.

59:59.544 --> 01:00:01.542
We did sort of kidnap him.

01:00:01.544 --> 01:00:03.810
You think
you fucking know someone.

01:00:03.812 --> 01:00:06.078
Made him drive 1500 miles.

01:00:07.878 --> 01:00:09.176
Hope you are to a stranger.

01:00:09.178 --> 01:00:11.742
And nick his drugs.

01:00:11.744 --> 01:00:14.078
- Fucking German cunt.
- Tone.

01:00:15.544 --> 01:00:17.043
So the money's gone.

01:00:17.045 --> 01:00:17.910
What do you think?

01:00:17.912 --> 01:00:19.110
I'll tell you what I fucking
think,

01:00:19.112 --> 01:00:22.776
how did you pair of dopey
cunts let this fucking happen?

01:00:22.778 --> 01:00:24.809
Look, I'm sorry Pat, I'm, I'm
ashamed.

01:00:24.811 --> 01:00:27.945
Yeah, you should be fucking
ashamed.

01:00:28.944 --> 01:00:29.945
What's that?

01:00:31.512 --> 01:00:32.643
That's an onion.

01:00:32.645 --> 01:00:35.743
That's right, it's a fucking
onion.

01:00:35.745 --> 01:00:37.746
It ain't 20 large is it.

01:00:40.145 --> 01:00:44.877
Luckily, and I'll say that
again, luckily for you two,

01:00:44.879 --> 01:00:48.077
I got a little plan, where
we can write all this down

01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:51.079
as a loss and still come out on
top.

01:00:57.544 --> 01:00:59.509
That's them now.

01:00:59.511 --> 01:01:00.977
He don't look like much.

01:01:00.979 --> 01:01:02.642
Who are the two puffs with the
beards?

01:01:02.644 --> 01:01:04.676
Seriously be
on your toes with them.

01:01:04.678 --> 01:01:06.676
That cunt's already put a suit
on me.

01:01:06.678 --> 01:01:07.546
Gotcha.

01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:10.177
So what's the plan?

01:01:10.179 --> 01:01:12.509
Upstairs to that gaff is an
office.

01:01:12.511 --> 01:01:15.009
And in that room is a
fucking safe in the corner.

01:01:15.011 --> 01:01:16.243
- What's in it?
- A shit load

01:01:16.245 --> 01:01:17.442
of fucking readies.

01:01:17.444 --> 01:01:20.742
- How do you fucking know?
- 'Cause I've fucking seen it.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:23.275
And we're gonna nick
every last fucking penny.

01:01:32.144 --> 01:01:33.376
You're just standing
there the pair of you,

01:01:33.378 --> 01:01:36.575
I've got a fucking neck brace
on, fucking hurt doing that.

01:01:36.577 --> 01:01:38.109
Shut up fucking
moaning and put your back

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:40.012
into it you lazy cunt.

01:01:41.044 --> 01:01:42.943
Fucking crack Tone.

01:01:42.945 --> 01:01:44.177
It's murder on the way out.

01:01:44.179 --> 01:01:46.177
Keep digging you
cunt.

01:01:46.179 --> 01:01:47.742
You're so good at this Rolphe.

01:01:47.744 --> 01:01:52.213
Tone, urgh, thanks for
fucking helping you cunt, ugh.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.142
- I tell you what, Tone,
- What the fuck was that?

01:01:57.144 --> 01:01:59.243
I've fucking go the fear mate.

01:01:59.245 --> 01:02:02.143
The fucking fish come right on
me yeah.

01:02:02.145 --> 01:02:03.909
I remember something.

01:02:03.911 --> 01:02:05.943
We've got to be nicking money
from fucking other villas

01:02:05.945 --> 01:02:08.509
so the old bill don't give two
fucks.

01:02:10.511 --> 01:02:13.609
So we will be back home
on sweet Essex soil

01:02:13.611 --> 01:02:17.609
before anyone has a fucking
clue what day it is.

01:04:05.278 --> 01:04:09.276
Fucking gorgeous.

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:15.643
Fucking

01:04:42.944 --> 01:04:43.813
Drink?

01:04:45.778 --> 01:04:47.709
What do you want?

01:04:47.711 --> 01:04:49.045
Peace offering.

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:51.712
Come on then.

01:05:03.044 --> 01:05:06.179
Ah.

01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:11.643
Sorry for biting your
head off the other night.

01:05:11.645 --> 01:05:13.076
It's all right.

01:05:13.078 --> 01:05:15.742
Both know I can be a cunt.

01:05:15.744 --> 01:05:16.745
Yes we do.

01:05:18.143 --> 01:05:22.179
Listen Tel, there's
something you need to see.

01:05:49.544 --> 01:05:50.812
You know this?

01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:54.711
What have you done to me.

01:05:56.879 --> 01:05:58.109
You cunt.

01:05:58.111 --> 01:05:59.675
You're fucking dead.

01:05:59.677 --> 01:06:00.842
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:06:00.844 --> 01:06:03.843
How does that happen Tel?

01:06:03.845 --> 01:06:05.109
I'm listening.

01:06:05.111 --> 01:06:07.176
You're an embarrassment mate.

01:06:07.178 --> 01:06:10.642
There's your knight in shining
armour.

01:06:10.644 --> 01:06:12.843
He set the whole thing
up from the beginning,

01:06:12.845 --> 01:06:15.778
and he's done you up like a
kipper.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:23.144
You lied to me, you disrespected
me,

01:06:24.677 --> 01:06:26.776
and you threatened me.

01:06:28.611 --> 01:06:31.078
I'll send you a postcard, cunt.

01:07:20.011 --> 01:07:22.543
- Here you are Tone.
- Cheers for that.

01:07:22.545 --> 01:07:26.142
Pat take that.

01:07:26.144 --> 01:07:28.676
- Right, are we ready?
- Yeah.

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:29.975
- Get your mask down.
- Oh, wait a second.

01:07:29.977 --> 01:07:31.208
It's stuck in the back.

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.609
- No just get it down.
- No, no one second.

01:07:32.611 --> 01:07:34.077
Ah Pat, ah Pat, ow!

01:07:37.711 --> 01:07:39.109
Fucks Agh!

01:07:40.612 --> 01:07:42.142
- For fuck's sake!
- What you fucking doing,

01:07:42.144 --> 01:07:43.109
you silly cunt.

01:07:43.111 --> 01:07:44.642
Get out of here, now move.

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:04.078
- Shh shh shh shh.
- God.

01:08:04.978 --> 01:08:06.978
- Shh shh shh.
- Oh yeah.

01:08:08.511 --> 01:08:09.376
Shut your fucking
mouth.

01:08:09.378 --> 01:08:10.710
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- Shh shh shh,

01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:11.646
quiet down.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.742
Where's Rolphe?

01:08:22.743 --> 01:08:24.575
What the fuck are you
doing, you greedy cunt?

01:08:24.577 --> 01:08:25.274
I'm fucking starving.

01:08:25.277 --> 01:08:26.643
I haven't eaten in two days.

01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:29.042
Fucking move.

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:36.045
And then old Ron said...

01:08:38.277 --> 01:08:41.876
Oh, argh!

01:08:44.743 --> 01:08:46.709
Combination.

01:08:46.711 --> 01:08:49.911
Forget the hat, Pat, I know
it's you.

01:08:50.578 --> 01:08:51.510
I thought you were leaving.

01:08:51.511 --> 01:08:53.609
I am you cunt, as soon as I'm
done here.

01:08:53.611 --> 01:08:54.941
Now what's the combination?

01:08:54.943 --> 01:08:56.076
What do you want?

01:08:56.078 --> 01:08:58.742
Terry Fisher sends his
regards, and a fucking warning.

01:08:58.743 --> 01:09:01.942
Stay out of his business
you cunt or you're dead.

01:09:01.944 --> 01:09:03.642
Now what's the combination?

01:09:03.644 --> 01:09:04.542
Fuck you Pat.

01:09:04.545 --> 01:09:05.908
Now give him the fucking
combination,

01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:08.008
or I'll blow your fucking dick
off.

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.478
It's 241-5936.

01:09:11.778 --> 01:09:12.642
Good boy.

01:09:12.644 --> 01:09:13.778
Get the motor.

01:09:14.977 --> 01:09:16.444
Be on your toes.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.675
How are we looking?

01:09:33.676 --> 01:09:36.077
It's like fucking Christmas.

01:09:42.844 --> 01:09:44.446
Grab hold of that.

01:09:45.745 --> 01:09:47.808
Uh, fucking hell.

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:48.877
Fucking hell.

01:09:50.977 --> 01:09:54.542
For fuck's sake.

01:09:54.544 --> 01:09:56.543
Come on, fucking go!

01:09:56.545 --> 01:09:57.476
Tone, move!

01:09:57.478 --> 01:09:58.609
I'm not fucking
leaving the money!

01:09:58.611 --> 01:09:59.478
Come on!

01:10:00.544 --> 01:10:01.343
Pat!

01:10:04.877 --> 01:10:05.745
Argh!

01:10:07.878 --> 01:10:10.642
Fuck!

01:10:10.644 --> 01:10:11.512
Fuck!

01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:09.809
- You all right?
- Hey Pat.

01:11:09.811 --> 01:11:11.009
Which is what?

01:11:11.011 --> 01:11:12.145
Pills, cash.

01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:22.575
- All right treacle.
- Hello.

01:11:22.577 --> 01:11:23.708
So what happens with Terry now?

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:24.709
I'll tell you what happens to
Terry.

01:11:24.711 --> 01:11:26.708
Terry falls off the end
of the fucking world,

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:28.841
down to my new pal, Greener.

01:11:28.843 --> 01:11:33.677
Now, you, get in the car, and
this time sit up the front.

01:11:42.578 --> 01:11:43.610
What's wrong?

01:11:43.612 --> 01:11:44.675
It won't open.

01:11:44.677 --> 01:11:46.208
Are you sure, pull it.

01:11:51.144 --> 01:11:52.011
Calm down.

01:11:53.011 --> 01:11:55.141
You would've done exactly
the same thing to me

01:11:55.143 --> 01:11:56.775
as soon as you found out
Terry was fucking dead.

01:11:56.777 --> 01:11:58.841
No, you know that's not true.

01:11:58.843 --> 01:12:01.009
That's right, love, your
the first bird in history

01:12:01.011 --> 01:12:02.543
to tell the fucking truth.

01:12:03.977 --> 01:12:05.042
Why?

01:12:05.044 --> 01:12:08.774
I'll tell you why, Char,
do you wanna know why?

01:12:08.776 --> 01:12:12.008
Because you're weak and I'm
strong.

01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:13.175
You can fuck right off.

01:12:13.177 --> 01:12:15.243
- Let's get going.
- See you later.

01:12:18.278 --> 01:12:19.145
Hold.

01:12:19.943 --> 01:12:22.208
Come on darling, we're only
joking.

01:12:32.545 --> 01:12:34.611
Boy your shit don't show.

01:12:35.578 --> 01:12:37.509
Fucking cunts!

01:13:04.643 --> 01:13:07.744
Oh no no, no, no, you fucking
cunt.

01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:44.877
Wait.

01:13:53.643 --> 01:13:57.844
Nigel, Nigel,
Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel,

01:14:01.978 --> 01:14:05.578
- Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel
- It's showtime.

01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:12.008
What a magnificent
reception for the champion.

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:16.109
Like Tyson of haggler, Ben
says he's never dumped anybody.

01:14:16.111 --> 01:14:19.076
Pat, here Pat, come here,
come here, have a look.

01:14:19.078 --> 01:14:21.908
Have a look, there's Tony.

01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:23.608
I've never seen him
look so fucking happy.

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:26.541
- Go on Tone!
- Go on Tone!

01:14:26.543 --> 01:14:28.242
At 31 he knows
there aren't many nights

01:14:28.244 --> 01:14:31.509
like this ahead of him if he
loses.

01:14:31.511 --> 01:14:33.574
He's met the best and come
through.

01:14:33.576 --> 01:14:36.175
He's promised to drop everybody
tonight.

01:14:36.177 --> 01:14:39.841
A terrific reception for Nigel
Benn.

01:14:43.744 --> 01:14:44.809
Come on Nige.

01:14:44.811 --> 01:14:46.142
Once again,
here the ref in charge

01:14:46.144 --> 01:14:48.809
Darrow, now to give
instructions.

01:14:50.078 --> 01:14:54.575
And off they go, unbelievable
atmosphere here in Docklands.

01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:56.008
- Come on Nigel.
- Remember the G-Man

01:14:56.010 --> 01:14:59.508
McClellan has promised to
finish this in the first round.

01:14:59.510 --> 01:15:02.176
A lot of money on the
fight going short as well.

01:15:02.178 --> 01:15:03.041
Benn for champion.

01:15:05.576 --> 01:15:07.975
And they're going at it,
toe to toe from the start.

01:15:07.977 --> 01:15:10.574
No scouting measures here at
all.

01:15:10.576 --> 01:15:13.542
A lot of leather being thrown
very early on in this fight.

01:15:13.544 --> 01:15:15.275
Benn coming along the ropes
here.

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:17.875
He's trapped on the ropes and
McClellan and he's a late,

01:15:17.877 --> 01:15:19.208
he's gone through the ropes!

01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:23.176
There a play for the wait here
in the very first seconds.

01:15:23.178 --> 01:15:25.509
Right through the ropes,
crazy at the ringside.

01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:27.842
Can Nigel Benn get back in time?

01:15:27.844 --> 01:15:30.608
He's been pushed back in by
a couple of commentators.

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:32.941
- He's in, he's okay.
- Come on, Nigel.

01:15:32.943 --> 01:15:34.275
He's going
to be allowed to continue

01:15:34.277 --> 01:15:35.812
but for how long?

01:15:36.545 --> 01:15:39.276
Can he survive this opening
round?

01:15:39.278 --> 01:15:42.243
Keep your arms up Nigel!

01:15:42.245 --> 01:15:44.941
McClellan,
ready to finish this,

01:15:44.943 --> 01:15:47.141
right here and now.

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:50.542
Go on Nigel!

01:16:49.878 --> 01:16:50.745
Hello?

01:16:52.811 --> 01:16:56.976
I can't hear ya, hold
on a minute, hold on.

01:16:56.978 --> 01:16:58.445
Pat, it's Ken.

01:16:59.844 --> 01:17:01.775
Listen, mate, we've got
a big fucking problem.

01:17:01.777 --> 01:17:04.142
Yeah well spit it out, I've
got a fucking fight to watch.

01:17:04.144 --> 01:17:06.641
Some kid's been
taken to the hospital.

01:17:06.643 --> 01:17:07.809
So what?

01:17:07.811 --> 01:17:08.942
He took one of them pills,

01:17:08.944 --> 01:17:11.675
one of them new ones from Spain.

01:17:11.677 --> 01:17:13.941
- And what happened?
- I don't know mate.

01:17:13.943 --> 01:17:15.243
He's been rushed to hospital.

01:17:15.245 --> 01:17:16.210
It's not looking good.

01:17:16.212 --> 01:17:17.076
I've bill all over the gaff,

01:17:17.078 --> 01:17:20.978
asking questions, asking for you
by name.

01:17:22.543 --> 01:17:23.574
Now you listen to me
carefully,

01:17:23.576 --> 01:17:25.109
you flush everything you've got.

01:17:25.111 --> 01:17:26.541
You go through everyone else's
pockets

01:17:26.543 --> 01:17:28.042
and you do the fucking same.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:29.176
If anyone breathes a fucking
word

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:31.976
to the old bill they're dead.

01:17:31.978 --> 01:17:33.641
Yeah, no worries, Pat.

01:17:35.043 --> 01:17:35.976
That's it, will
power

01:17:35.978 --> 01:17:37.208
and they're fighting hard.

01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:40.477
The left arch is swerved Nigel
there.

01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:43.841
He's got McClellan in trouble as
well.

01:17:43.843 --> 01:17:44.842
We've got to go now.

01:17:44.844 --> 01:17:46.510
- What, what?
- Now!

01:17:47.377 --> 01:17:49.076
He's surely
gonna have to go down here.

01:17:50.077 --> 01:17:52.242
He has gone down,
McClellan, in the corner.

01:17:52.244 --> 01:17:54.008
The referee urges him to get up.

01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:55.708
He should be counting him.

01:17:55.710 --> 01:17:57.875
McClellan in a dark place now.

01:18:19.543 --> 01:18:20.709
Fucking hell Pat, I
can't believe we've got

01:18:20.711 --> 01:18:22.675
to get rid of all those pills.

01:18:22.677 --> 01:18:24.076
Listen, if we're
connected to those pills

01:18:24.078 --> 01:18:27.509
and that kid dies, we're
going down for fucking murder.

01:18:27.511 --> 01:18:29.941
Is that what you want?

01:18:29.943 --> 01:18:32.141
- Is that what you want?
- No, well of course not.

01:18:32.143 --> 01:18:34.808
It's just, just look
how many there is mate.

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.076
It's sacrilegious look, think
of all the fucking waste.

01:18:37.078 --> 01:18:38.842
Them pills are fucking poison.

01:18:38.844 --> 01:18:41.912
Sooner we get rid of them the
better.

01:18:47.777 --> 01:18:51.178
- Yes, yes yes!
- Things are going his way.

01:18:52.777 --> 01:18:56.012
Good punches coming in from
Nigel Benn.

01:18:57.611 --> 01:19:00.145
The G-Man is in big big trouble.

01:19:29.544 --> 01:19:32.745
Big upper cut, he's wobbled,
he's down.

01:19:45.978 --> 01:19:47.911
Last one, lovely boy.

01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:52.742
Eight, he's
reached nine.

01:19:52.744 --> 01:19:54.241
It is all over.

01:19:54.243 --> 01:19:56.774
Benn is the winner.

01:19:56.776 --> 01:19:58.978
Benn is still the champion.

01:20:17.544 --> 01:20:19.544
- What?
- Good news mate.

01:20:20.511 --> 01:20:21.511
False alarm.

01:20:22.611 --> 01:20:24.575
What you fucking talking
about?

01:20:24.577 --> 01:20:26.574
That kid that
got taken to hospital.

01:20:26.576 --> 01:20:27.908
Turns out he's an epileptic or
something.

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.642
Forgot to take his insulin.

01:20:29.644 --> 01:20:31.175
Them pills are sweet mate.

01:20:34.243 --> 01:20:37.175
Caw Pat, coming right
on me.

01:20:37.177 --> 01:20:40.641
They're the best fucking pills
I've ever taken in my life.

01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:47.645
No no no no no.

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:49.611
Fucking hell!

01:24:29.142 --> 01:24:32.242
Wait.

01:24:32.244 --> 01:24:37.445
Listen mate,
they both fucked us,

01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:42.007
Pat Tate and Charlotte.

01:24:42.009 --> 01:24:45.842
And I've got something you
didn't know.

01:24:45.844 --> 01:24:48.008
You've got three seconds, go.

01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:52.077
I've 250,000 pills
landing in Ibiza next week.

01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:59.109
