00:21.360 --> 00:25.420
(When there's
nowhere else to run)

00:26.040 --> 00:31.920
(Is there room
for one more son?)

00:33.480 --> 00:36.520
(One more son)

00:38.660 --> 00:41.580
(If you can hold on)

00:43.140 --> 00:46.380
(If you can hold on...)

00:47.430 --> 00:49.180
(Hold on)

01:13.310 --> 01:15.221
(I wanna stand up,)

01:15.427 --> 01:16.940
(I wanna let go)

01:17.291 --> 01:18.746
(You know, you know,)

01:18.979 --> 01:21.008
(No, you don't,
you don't)

01:21.462 --> 01:25.566
(I wanna shine on
in the hearts of men)

01:25.569 --> 01:29.621
(I want a meaning from the
back of my broken hand )

01:29.627 --> 01:33.573
(Another head aches,
another heart breaks)

01:33.578 --> 01:37.822
(I'm so much older
than I can take... )

01:37.828 --> 01:39.802
...is high on
Capital Hill

01:39.806 --> 01:41.242
as an emergency
session of Congress

01:41.246 --> 01:45.722
prepares to hear the President
address the issue of global violence.

01:45.997 --> 01:49.822
Recent attacks have pushed this
administration to take extreme action

01:49.987 --> 01:52.323
raising more fears
than it's alleviated.

01:52.327 --> 01:54.013
With global
tension rising,

01:54.286 --> 01:56.402
the President is
taking a risky step

01:56.406 --> 01:58.972
by confronting what some
political observers...

02:03.478 --> 02:04.522
Oh, I can't believe it.

02:05.678 --> 02:06.530
Jake Green.

02:07.038 --> 02:08.592
How you doing, man?

02:09.634 --> 02:11.642
--When did you get back
to town? --Just now.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.220
Is that Bonnie?

02:14.437 --> 02:15.923
You grew up.

02:16.765 --> 02:18.130
Wait a minute, where
the hell you been?

02:19.218 --> 02:20.311
You know, around.

02:20.788 --> 02:24.341
--Jake, no one's been around
for five years. --The Army.

02:24.597 --> 02:27.150
--I've been in the
Army. --Good for you.

02:28.237 --> 02:30.533
--Who's that?
--She's from the IRS.

02:31.466 --> 02:33.331
--IRS? Audit
IRS? --Yeah.

02:34.156 --> 02:37.043
--Not going well?
--No. Forget it.

02:37.048 --> 02:40.080
How about you and I, we go
out tonight and we catch up?

02:40.088 --> 02:42.383
I'd love to, but I just came
in to see my grandfather, and

02:42.708 --> 02:44.611
--I've got to get
back, so... --Okay.

02:45.946 --> 02:46.721
Bonnie.

02:50.325 --> 02:52.733
Bonnie, we need a pie.
One strawberry rhubarb.

02:55.547 --> 02:57.531
Welcome back to
Jericho, Jake.

03:01.105 --> 03:02.400
His wife is lovely,

03:02.527 --> 03:04.233
but I don't
know about him.

03:04.588 --> 03:07.580
Mrs. Olsen made me
promise not to tell,

03:07.587 --> 03:11.033
but she heard that he bought
the old Thompson place in cash.

03:11.508 --> 03:12.433
Cash.

03:14.157 --> 03:17.271
--That color looks really
good on you. --I know.

03:18.247 --> 03:21.631
--Why didn't your mom take you to
New York? --'Cause she hates me.

03:23.586 --> 03:25.333
What are you
looking at, loser?

03:29.856 --> 03:33.282
I could be shopping in SoHo right
now instead of Gracie's Market.

03:33.288 --> 03:34.653
--I know. Look at
this thing-- --so ugly.

03:35.597 --> 03:38.473
--Promise not to tell?
--Promise, Mrs. Leigh.

03:38.678 --> 03:40.073
What about you, Jake?

03:40.196 --> 03:41.680
Where have you been
keeping yourself?

03:42.546 --> 03:44.412
I've been playing
minor league baseball.

03:44.956 --> 03:47.113
Oh, is that a fact?

03:47.838 --> 03:48.652
Well...

03:49.165 --> 03:50.601
when do you get
in from Chicago?

03:52.317 --> 03:53.091
All right.

03:53.926 --> 03:55.633
Good. I'll pick you up.

04:01.598 --> 04:02.731
I love you, too.

04:06.396 --> 04:09.231
--Hey. --Sorry,
hi. Um...

04:10.166 --> 04:11.130
What are you doing here?

04:11.616 --> 04:14.891
I just came in for the day
to visit my grandfather,

04:14.896 --> 04:17.690
--see the family.
--Yeah, of course, sure.

04:17.718 --> 04:20.913
--I just didn't hear.
--Anyway, how you been?

04:21.538 --> 04:23.211
Mom tells me you're teaching
at the high school now.

04:24.136 --> 04:26.230
--Yeah, it's
weird, huh? --Yeah.

04:26.458 --> 04:27.113
I love it.

04:28.106 --> 04:29.851
I just bought a
house in the Pines.

04:30.597 --> 04:32.402
The East Side on
a teacher's salary?

04:33.507 --> 04:35.040
Uh, my-my fianc?

04:35.156 --> 04:37.300
he's in banking, so...

04:38.428 --> 04:42.272
--Oh, that helps. --Yeah,
Roger really loves it here.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.863
Well, I'm happy
for you, Emily.

04:47.446 --> 04:49.630
--How about you, you
got somebody? --No.

04:52.088 --> 04:54.890
--I'm sorry, I shouldn't...
--No, you're not, you love it.

04:59.337 --> 05:02.841
--Where have you
been? --The Navy.

05:06.467 --> 05:08.051
Oh, why do I even bother?

05:08.727 --> 05:09.590
Seriously...

05:10.537 --> 05:11.972
where have you been?

05:12.916 --> 05:17.041
(And you ask me what
I want this year)

05:17.047 --> 05:21.250
(And I try to make
this kind and clear)

05:21.537 --> 05:28.943
(Just a chance that maybe
we'll find better days )

05:29.608 --> 05:34.242
('Cause I don't need
boxes wrapped in strings)

05:34.248 --> 05:38.212
(And desire and love
and empty things)

05:38.216 --> 05:47.102
(Just a chance that maybe
we'll find better days)

05:47.105 --> 05:50.710
(So take these words..)

05:49.056 --> 05:50.762
Oh, Jake!

05:51.327 --> 05:52.373
Oh, honey!

05:52.928 --> 05:56.272
--Oh, you're home!
--You're choking me, Mom.

05:57.278 --> 05:58.813
I thought I heard
an annoying voice.

05:58.978 --> 06:01.621
--Hey, brother.
--Good to see you.

06:03.827 --> 06:09.181
('Cause tonight's the night
the world begins again.)

06:09.187 --> 06:11.092
I'm not here to interfere
with your campaign, Dad.

06:11.096 --> 06:12.463
All I want is
your signature,

06:12.468 --> 06:13.592
then I'll
visit Grandpa...

06:13.728 --> 06:14.823
After five years, Jake,

06:14.827 --> 06:15.992
that's all you
have to say to Dad?

06:15.995 --> 06:19.621
--It's none of your business, Eric. --It
is his business, it is all our business.

06:19.626 --> 06:22.203
--What you put this family
through... --Johnston. For god's sake.

06:22.205 --> 06:25.081
--Now, he could've been... --We could spend a
week talking about what I could've been, all right?

06:25.087 --> 06:25.973
I've apologized.

06:26.085 --> 06:27.252
I've made amends.

06:27.917 --> 06:28.892
This is me now.

06:29.395 --> 06:32.263
--I have a plan, but I need my money to
make a clean start. --It's not your money,

06:32.268 --> 06:35.181
--it's your grandfather's money. --I
know, but he gave it to me for a reason.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.830
And he gave me authority
over it for a reason.

06:40.227 --> 06:44.002
--You convince me you're leading a more
productive life and then... --That's right, Jake.

06:44.436 --> 06:45.763
We were both born
on third base.

06:45.888 --> 06:47.591
Quit pretending
you hit a triple.

06:50.856 --> 06:54.893
--Now, when are you going to realize
I'm 32-years-old. --When you do.

07:00.717 --> 07:03.390
Can I talk to my
mayor then, huh?

07:07.096 --> 07:08.920
Let's go see
your grandfather.

07:13.488 --> 07:15.931
--I just...
--Stop it, Jake.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.362
--The one thing I can't... --You
would have been here if you could.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.390
I brought money.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.861
--Here. --I
can't, Mom.

07:35.306 --> 07:37.682
--I'll talk to your
father. --He doesn't get it.

07:38.616 --> 07:41.432
--Because you won't tell him why
you really need the money. --Mom.

07:41.435 --> 07:43.061
You don't give
him enough credit.

07:43.138 --> 07:46.102
--Your dad's had a few trials of his
own, you know? --He can never know.

07:52.728 --> 07:53.700
Just...

07:53.887 --> 07:57.611
--Stay one more day. --I got to
get back to San Diego by tomorrow.

08:02.376 --> 08:04.472
--Mom, one more
thing. --Hmm?

08:08.227 --> 08:09.790
You have clumsy hands.

08:12.356 --> 08:13.482
I love you.

08:13.746 --> 08:15.530
Be careful now, okay?

08:33.996 --> 08:37.863
Mr. Speaker, the President
of the United States.

08:39.976 --> 08:42.539
Do I have to watch this?

08:47.337 --> 08:53.832
(Old McDonald had
a farm E-I-E-I-O)

08:51.908 --> 08:54.200
Yeah, well, we finally found
a garage where we can fix it.

08:54.596 --> 08:55.841
We had to take a detour.

09:01.257 --> 09:03.000
...ocean of hatred...

09:02.756 --> 09:04.273
Feel like I'm
back in D.C.

09:03.737 --> 09:05.680
...in our great
nation, and yet,

09:05.885 --> 09:08.550
we all know that these
divisions pale in comparison

09:08.557 --> 09:11.752
to the fundamental dangers
posed by the threat of terror.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.350
We have an eternal
commitment to leave the world

09:14.357 --> 09:16.712
a better place for our
children and grandchildren.

09:16.717 --> 09:20.640
This has always been our
promise and this will always...

09:19.301 --> 09:24.726
Five, four,
three, two, one.

09:28.329 --> 09:30.307
We'll be back in
an hour, Mr. McVey.

09:31.332 --> 09:33.656
Mr. McVey? Hello?

09:36.009 --> 09:37.033
...carried on...

09:45.238 --> 09:46.200
We have...

09:57.207 --> 09:58.532
No fun, Woody.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.873
You have to hide better!

10:08.917 --> 10:10.002
Woody?

10:11.728 --> 10:13.162
What are you looking at?

10:56.118 --> 10:57.243
Look! Look it!

11:01.585 --> 11:02.813
Hurry on there right now.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.081
Yeah, you better hurry
up and get on home then.

11:05.088 --> 11:05.941
Where's Cody?!

11:05.988 --> 11:07.903
Has anyone seen Cody?

11:08.437 --> 11:09.602
We haven't got time.

11:20.355 --> 11:21.832
Shh.

11:22.697 --> 11:25.281
Gail, what's going on?

11:27.516 --> 11:28.871
Oh, Johnston.

11:32.768 --> 11:33.552
Nothing.

11:34.608 --> 11:36.833
All right, it looks like the
explosion came from the west,

11:36.838 --> 11:37.421
maybe Denver.

11:37.508 --> 11:39.140
Jimmy, get on the radio.

11:39.148 --> 11:40.553
I want everybody at
the sheriff's station.

11:40.556 --> 11:42.552
--I'll pick up Eric.
Let's move. --All right.

11:42.558 --> 11:44.041
Dad, don't leave.

11:46.126 --> 11:46.980
Come here.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.350
I'll be back real
soon, all right?

11:59.455 --> 12:00.580
Johnston.

12:03.276 --> 12:04.320
Jake.

12:06.297 --> 12:07.501
We'll find him.

12:41.225 --> 12:42.071
We're bringing them
out of the mine,

12:42.076 --> 12:43.520
five at a time
like always.

12:43.527 --> 12:44.881
No need to start a panic.

12:44.887 --> 12:48.191
--You're just trying to get another hour's
work out of my men! --Stop it, the both of you.

12:48.865 --> 12:52.023
Norman, get everybody out
of the mine immediately.

12:52.025 --> 12:53.973
And Shep, help
him for a change.

12:55.695 --> 12:57.441
--Sheriff?
Chief? --Yeah?

12:57.448 --> 13:00.592
--Damage, fires, buildings?
--Nothing, Mr. Mayor.

13:00.595 --> 13:02.342
--The town's fine. --Well,
let's hope you're right.

13:02.395 --> 13:03.283
What does that mean?

13:05.265 --> 13:06.942
Do we have any
Geiger counters?

13:11.835 --> 13:12.550
Excuse me?

13:12.728 --> 13:13.470
Uh, excuse me.

13:13.477 --> 13:15.152
Did something happen?

13:15.936 --> 13:17.923
So, what does the
emergency plan say?

13:18.588 --> 13:21.342
Contact the governor, National
Guard and state troopers.

13:21.696 --> 13:25.823
--Are we under attack? --Son, I
don't want to hear that word again.

13:26.337 --> 13:27.561
Now look, this could
have been a test.

13:27.568 --> 13:28.552
It could have
been an accident.

13:28.556 --> 13:31.003
There's, uh, military
bases near Denver.

13:31.597 --> 13:34.123
One explosion does
not make an attack.

13:35.685 --> 13:36.623
If we stay calm,

13:36.817 --> 13:38.242
the town stays
calm, okay?

13:59.266 --> 14:00.271
Oh.

14:00.986 --> 14:02.790
--I found the Geiger
counters. --Thanks.

14:03.097 --> 14:04.543
Oh, Grey, good
to see you.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.193
--We can use the extra help.
--Well, thank you, Johnston, Eric.

14:07.397 --> 14:10.702
--Well, what can I do to
help? --We'll let you know.

14:14.917 --> 14:15.990
Does it work, Dad?

14:18.218 --> 14:19.280
Looks okay.

14:19.286 --> 14:20.330
Mr. Mayor.

14:20.766 --> 14:25.312
--Sheriff-- the bomb? --Yes, ma'am, so
far there's no sign of any radiation.

14:25.316 --> 14:27.492
--We'll keep checking
around town. --No. No, sir.

14:28.165 --> 14:31.741
The school bus isn't back from
the field trip with my daughter.

14:34.217 --> 14:36.442
--Well, do
something! --I got it.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.593
--You-You should be out there looking
for Stacy. --Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, Teresa,

14:39.598 --> 14:41.420
this is the first
we've heard of it,

14:41.628 --> 14:42.903
but we will deal
with it, all right?

14:42.907 --> 14:45.913
--Just please don't worry.
--That's easy for you to say.

14:46.775 --> 14:48.522
You don't have a
child out there.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.782
So the school bus
was here at the caves.

15:38.788 --> 15:40.853
Now, who can tell me where they
might have gone for repairs?

15:40.858 --> 15:44.472
--Well, there's Wilson's garage
off 160. --Or Cedar Run Road.

15:44.478 --> 15:46.411
Principal Movey said
they took a detour

15:46.415 --> 15:47.541
before the phone cut out.

15:47.738 --> 15:48.843
Well, I figure two teams.

15:48.845 --> 15:50.511
There's only so many
places they could be.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.892
--Now, what about the
parents? --Right, right.

15:54.668 --> 15:57.872
Folks. Folks! Folks.

16:00.607 --> 16:04.581
Now, look, I know that every part
of you wantsto just rush out there.

16:04.585 --> 16:05.590
I don't blame you.

16:06.617 --> 16:09.413
But as your friend, I'm
asking you to think about that.

16:10.416 --> 16:11.460
You're safe here.

16:12.288 --> 16:14.232
Now, what if, God forbid,

16:14.935 --> 16:16.593
you go out there,
and you get stranded,

16:16.598 --> 16:18.582
and your child
comes back an orphan?

16:19.788 --> 16:20.930
You know the
sheriff and his men.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.701
You know they'll find
your kids, so please.

16:33.656 --> 16:34.460
Help!

16:37.517 --> 16:38.413
Mister!

16:40.826 --> 16:42.190
Mister, please!

16:43.165 --> 16:44.060
Mister!

16:44.888 --> 16:45.933
What? What is it?

16:47.276 --> 16:48.750
Mister, help!

16:49.375 --> 16:51.103
--Mister, please!
--I think they're...

16:51.245 --> 16:52.523
I think they're dying!

17:06.608 --> 17:07.502
That's fine.

17:14.694 --> 17:15.369
Let's go find out.

17:15.377 --> 17:17.859
Jimmy, get over there
and calm those folks down.

17:19.015 --> 17:20.602
Hey, Pete, come on!

17:20.605 --> 17:22.441
We have our
frequencies, sir,

17:23.588 --> 17:25.880
but outside, it's like
there's no one there.

17:26.358 --> 17:27.290
All right, um...

17:27.928 --> 17:28.900
what about analog?

17:28.907 --> 17:31.723
We could contact the governor
with a Ham radio, couldn't we?

17:31.728 --> 17:34.532
That could work, but there's
only one in town that I know of.

17:35.398 --> 17:37.341
I was afraid you were
going to say that.

17:38.356 --> 17:40.583
Excuse me, Sheriff?

17:40.876 --> 17:42.000
Robert Hawkins.

17:42.108 --> 17:43.461
Well, it's good to
meet you, Mr. Hawkins,

17:43.468 --> 17:45.193
but as you can see,
we've got our hands full.

17:45.196 --> 17:46.521
Could you use
an extra man?

17:46.526 --> 17:48.190
No civilians,
mayor's orders.

17:48.325 --> 17:51.210
But I used to be
a cop-- St. Louis.

17:51.825 --> 17:55.493
--Do you know the roads around
here? --No, just moved to town.

17:55.495 --> 17:58.353
Then I'm afraid you'd just
slow us down, I'm sorry.

17:59.805 --> 18:01.943
You might want to get
some black spray paint.

18:04.285 --> 18:06.380
You know, cover that?

18:07.386 --> 18:09.680
Look, I know you're telling
people it was an accident,

18:10.156 --> 18:11.470
and I hope it was,

18:12.687 --> 18:14.793
but if it was an
attack, Sheriff,

18:14.966 --> 18:16.482
and there's
chaos out there,

18:17.225 --> 18:18.711
you might not want the
wrong people knowing

18:18.716 --> 18:20.282
that Jericho
is still here.

18:21.186 --> 18:24.142
With all due
respect, Mr. Hawkins,

18:24.517 --> 18:26.260
this is not St. Louis.

18:31.857 --> 18:33.473
--Dad, are you okay?
--Yeah, I'm fine.

18:33.475 --> 18:34.531
Don't worry about me.

18:35.747 --> 18:38.271
Oh, Oliver, would
you stop that?

18:39.887 --> 18:41.363
Sorry, Johnston.

18:42.296 --> 18:43.623
Thought you were aliens.

18:44.095 --> 18:47.190
Well, we're under attack
by aliens, don't you know?

18:47.195 --> 18:48.591
Yes, we do. That's
why we're here.

18:48.996 --> 18:52.352
--Do you have your
Ham radio? --Yeah.

18:53.567 --> 18:57.001
--For you, 50
cents. --Oliver.

18:57.227 --> 19:02.761
--Well, I need my
50 cents. --Okay.

19:03.908 --> 19:05.542
Let me get you change.

19:09.778 --> 19:12.090
Hi, Dale. Sorry I
didn't call sooner, Angel

19:12.098 --> 19:14.533
but we decided to stay in the
city an extra couple of days.

19:14.538 --> 19:18.301
--Put down the phone and come to
bed. --Honey, stop that. It's my kid.

19:18.856 --> 19:22.160
--Baby, what are you staring at out the
window? --Get over here and look at this!

19:23.036 --> 19:24.220
What-What is that?

19:24.457 --> 19:27.073
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

19:29.978 --> 19:32.110
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't
call sooner, Angel,

19:32.116 --> 19:34.680
but we decided to stay in the
city an extra couple of days.

19:34.685 --> 19:37.141
--Put down the phone and
come to bed. --Honey...

19:37.975 --> 19:40.491
...but we decided to stay in
the city an extra couple days.

19:40.495 --> 19:42.261
Put down the phone
and come to bed.

19:42.266 --> 19:45.302
Hon... Hi, Dale. Sorry I
didn't call sooner, Angel

19:45.308 --> 19:46.512
but we decided...

19:46.947 --> 19:48.923
Hi, Dale. Sorry I
didn't call sooner, Angel

19:48.928 --> 19:51.443
but we decided to stay in
the city an extra couple days.

19:51.447 --> 19:56.512
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that. It's my kid. Baby...

20:06.968 --> 20:08.790
--How could we lose
power? --I don't know.

20:08.796 --> 20:09.920
Bomb could have
fried the relays.

20:09.925 --> 20:11.131
--That's
possible. --Maybe.

20:11.488 --> 20:13.580
They could've blown up the
power station for all we know.

20:13.605 --> 20:17.750
Guys, it was probably just a
drain on the system from Denver.

20:19.088 --> 20:21.611
You a science teacher?

20:22.556 --> 20:24.612
--Robert Hawkins.
--Chief Carroll.

20:24.618 --> 20:26.232
--Hey.
--Hey.

20:33.375 --> 20:34.850
Jimmy, what's your 20?

20:35.286 --> 20:36.650
Willow Creek, Sheriff.

20:36.655 --> 20:38.493
There is
nothing in sight.

20:47.435 --> 20:51.601
The deer went crazy and started
running all over the road.

20:52.205 --> 20:53.751
All right, just
don't look at it.

21:02.957 --> 21:03.813
Is he alive?

21:04.648 --> 21:05.461
Yeah.

21:06.178 --> 21:08.931
--Are you
okay? --Yeah.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.513
I think my leg is broken.

21:11.975 --> 21:14.481
--Can you feel
your toes? --Yeah.

21:15.535 --> 21:16.822
Don't worry about me.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.251
Worry about them.

21:20.516 --> 21:21.640
Is anybody hurt?

21:21.866 --> 21:23.220
Huh? Anybody?

21:24.508 --> 21:25.670
Stacy's sick.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.201
She can't breathe.

21:32.285 --> 21:33.181
What's wrong?

21:33.618 --> 21:34.770
What happened?

21:34.795 --> 21:35.691
When the bus stopped,

21:35.697 --> 21:36.780
she was like this.

21:39.087 --> 21:40.420
It's okay,
Stacy, let me see.

21:40.708 --> 21:41.482
Let me see it?

21:43.436 --> 21:44.370
Can I see?

21:44.506 --> 21:45.223
Let me just see, Stacy.

21:45.396 --> 21:47.291
It's okay. It's okay.

21:49.656 --> 21:50.932
Do you have an ice pack?

21:51.106 --> 21:52.790
We've got to stop
the swelling now.

21:53.508 --> 21:56.220
Lucas, the first aid
kit is under the seat.

21:57.038 --> 21:57.811
You're okay.

21:58.557 --> 22:00.610
Come on, it's all right.

22:00.646 --> 22:01.350
Just keep breathing.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.721
Breathe normally,
all right?

22:02.786 --> 22:04.930
It's okay. It's
okay, you're fine.

22:04.935 --> 22:06.250
Just keep
breathing normally.

22:08.987 --> 22:10.360
Okay, you're okay.

22:10.667 --> 22:11.721
You're okay.

22:13.855 --> 22:14.781
Please.

22:15.676 --> 22:17.693
Calm down, calm down.

22:18.108 --> 22:20.532
Hey? Hey, Stacy?

22:20.776 --> 22:22.732
No, no, no. No.

22:43.467 --> 22:45.800
Think. Think.

22:45.978 --> 22:46.903
Think.

22:48.787 --> 22:49.603
All right.

22:49.607 --> 22:50.711
Look, I need everyone's
help right now.

22:50.718 --> 22:51.610
Who has a pen?

22:51.617 --> 22:52.280
Does anyone?

22:53.577 --> 22:54.520
Does anybody have a pen?

22:54.525 --> 22:55.733
All right, I need a pen.

22:55.735 --> 22:57.961
--We have pencils.
--No, I need a tube.

22:57.966 --> 22:59.181
Something hollow, um...

22:59.188 --> 23:00.080
A straw.

23:00.175 --> 23:01.460
--I have a straw.
--Here, let me see it.

23:01.465 --> 23:02.431
Let me see it, come on.

23:03.518 --> 23:04.491
That's too thin.

23:04.748 --> 23:06.300
Does anyone else
have a juice box?

23:06.267 --> 23:07.383
--I do! --All right, get
them out, get them out.

23:07.388 --> 23:08.320
Get some Band-Aids out.

23:08.328 --> 23:09.332
--What's your
name? --Julie.

23:09.336 --> 23:10.732
All right, everybody
give your straws to Julie.

23:10.735 --> 23:12.183
Okay? Hurry, quick.

23:12.498 --> 23:13.660
Make them into a circle.

23:14.616 --> 23:15.823
All right, you got that?

23:16.787 --> 23:19.032
There you go, now tape them
together with those Band-Aids.

23:20.648 --> 23:21.851
Come on, Stacy.

23:26.207 --> 23:27.533
All right, who's
the strongest kid?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.203
You. I need you to
hold her shoulders down,

23:30.206 --> 23:31.222
in case she wakes
up. All right?

23:31.895 --> 23:32.901
Don't look.

23:45.255 --> 23:46.420
Where's my straws?

23:56.497 --> 23:57.473
Come on, come on.

24:00.396 --> 24:03.310
Breathe for me,
okay? Please?

24:03.635 --> 24:04.873
Come on. Come on.

24:41.027 --> 24:42.503
Wait, I see something.

24:42.956 --> 24:46.351
--Okay, okay, we see
the bus. --Uh, good.

24:46.358 --> 24:49.550
--You want us? --No, no,
you keep looking for Jake.

24:54.865 --> 24:56.313
Let's get down
there, boys.

25:00.175 --> 25:02.272
How'd you learn
how to do that?

25:02.988 --> 25:04.931
Uh, military school.

25:05.845 --> 25:07.693
Were you a soldier?

25:09.458 --> 25:11.360
No, a screw up.

25:34.206 --> 25:35.222
Sheriff.

25:35.687 --> 25:36.733
Sheriff, look at this.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.411
It's the wrong bus!

25:38.416 --> 25:40.911
Riley, Riley
get over here!

25:41.656 --> 25:42.702
Riley!

25:52.908 --> 25:54.192
Oh, great.

25:54.356 --> 25:56.262
Where's the damn
rescue party?

25:57.786 --> 25:59.221
Oh, hi, Dale.

25:59.847 --> 26:01.340
Come on in, honey.

26:01.347 --> 26:03.991
Come on, we're all trying
to get through this together.

26:07.425 --> 26:08.513
Hi, Dale.

26:09.765 --> 26:10.853
You okay, honey?

26:13.707 --> 26:14.601
What you got there?

26:17.917 --> 26:18.963
It's my mom.

26:20.826 --> 26:23.292
Hi, Dale, sorry I
didn't call sooner, Angel

26:23.295 --> 26:25.821
but we decided to stay in
the city an extra couple days.

26:25.827 --> 26:29.211
--Put down the phone and come to
bed. --Honey, stop that, it's my kid.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.802
Baby, what are you
staring at out the window?

26:31.807 --> 26:33.292
Get over here
and look at this!

26:33.728 --> 26:35.290
What, what is that?

26:35.886 --> 26:37.981
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

26:46.878 --> 26:49.091
Oh, Dale, I am so sorry.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.621
I didn't know your
mother was in Denver.

26:53.395 --> 26:54.641
She wasn't in Denver.

26:55.755 --> 26:56.611
She was in Atlanta.

26:57.266 --> 26:59.292
Oh, my God.

27:05.236 --> 27:07.761
I'm sure that they'll
have some answers.

27:10.077 --> 27:11.071
Oh, my God.

27:16.185 --> 27:17.041
How is she?

27:17.147 --> 27:18.541
We have to get her back.

27:32.106 --> 27:33.362
Right here. Right here.

27:35.018 --> 27:38.982
Miss Lisinski, are we going
to have school tomorrow?

27:40.396 --> 27:41.792
We'll figure
it out, honey.

27:42.695 --> 27:43.791
I vote no.

27:50.576 --> 27:52.832
Dale, Dale, what
are you doing, honey?

27:53.456 --> 27:55.440
Please, please
don't steal from me.

27:55.747 --> 27:56.643
Dale!

28:00.326 --> 28:01.682
--Ready?
--Yeah, yeah.

28:02.768 --> 28:03.892
Hey, you got extra there?

28:03.897 --> 28:05.311
First come, first serve.

28:06.457 --> 28:07.971
You filled up your truck, you
going to mow your lawn, too?

28:07.977 --> 28:10.293
--I've got a family, you
know? --We've all got families.

28:10.296 --> 28:10.871
Come on.

28:11.778 --> 28:12.930
Get your hand
off the can.

28:13.756 --> 28:14.612
Come on.

28:14.987 --> 28:16.771
What do you think
you're doing, hmm?

28:17.246 --> 28:18.400
--What are you doing?
--What's your problem?

28:20.828 --> 28:22.160
All right,
everybody sit down.

28:37.748 --> 28:38.642
Hurry.

28:48.797 --> 28:51.401
Food won't go rotten as long
as the weather stays cool.

28:51.756 --> 28:53.742
Hopefully the power
will be fixed by then.

28:54.568 --> 28:56.082
Thank you for this, Dale.

28:57.766 --> 28:59.040
Anything for you, ma'am.

29:04.918 --> 29:07.482
--Step away from the
car. --Get out of the car.

29:09.308 --> 29:11.403
--Hey, hey, hey, hey,
come on, --break it up.

29:11.406 --> 29:13.220
Get off.

29:13.227 --> 29:14.612
You need to get
some lights on

29:14.888 --> 29:16.883
before people
start losing it.

29:16.887 --> 29:18.641
All we have is lanterns
and flashlights.

29:18.648 --> 29:20.512
That's not enough to
light up the street though.

29:20.828 --> 29:23.541
But your town does
roadwork at night, right?

29:27.908 --> 29:28.763
Excuse me.

29:30.407 --> 29:33.341
--The machine doesn't work. --Well,
you guys have to pay cash or something!

29:40.995 --> 29:42.583
You sure you're not
the science teacher?

29:42.906 --> 29:45.673
Chief, we got a little problem
down here at the gas station.

29:45.676 --> 29:47.151
We need your
help right away.

29:48.566 --> 29:50.360
--I'm on my way.
--I got this.

29:50.495 --> 29:52.640
--I'll come with you.
--All right, thanks.

29:53.615 --> 29:54.351
Sir.

29:54.877 --> 29:56.371
Something's going on
at the gas station.

29:56.557 --> 29:57.101
Big crowd.

29:57.228 --> 29:58.233
Looks like trouble.

29:58.747 --> 29:59.832
Gonna need
help down here.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.053
--Dad.
--I heard.

30:02.056 --> 30:03.110
Go, go.

30:05.666 --> 30:06.803
--Sara?
--It's okay.

30:07.018 --> 30:07.602
Honey?

30:07.915 --> 30:09.380
I don't have
time right now.

30:09.386 --> 30:10.900
--Some damn
fool... --Johnston.

30:10.908 --> 30:12.772
--What?
--Listen to me.

30:13.948 --> 30:17.880
Dale Turner's mother died
tonight in another explosion.

30:20.338 --> 30:21.903
Atlanta.

30:24.466 --> 30:25.793
Oh, my God.

30:47.467 --> 30:48.320
Sheriff?

30:48.485 --> 30:49.593
Yeah, there's no
sign of Jake out here

30:49.595 --> 30:52.122
in fact, there's, uh,
no sign of anybody.

30:52.818 --> 30:53.302
We're going to,

30:53.307 --> 30:54.400
we're going to head back.

30:54.827 --> 30:56.693
Let me know if the
kids need anything

30:57.027 --> 30:57.922
Sheriff, you there?

30:59.217 --> 31:00.340
Stay awake.

31:01.138 --> 31:02.611
Stay awake,
don't--

31:06.685 --> 31:08.520
Does this bus
have a gas can?

31:13.036 --> 31:14.210
If the bus...

31:15.887 --> 31:17.213
If it stops...

31:18.456 --> 31:19.271
Okay.

31:22.926 --> 31:24.681
Kids, listen to me.

31:26.475 --> 31:28.012
If the bus stops again,

31:28.837 --> 31:31.793
we're going to need
you to walk back to town

31:32.235 --> 31:34.180
and get help, okay?

31:35.057 --> 31:36.530
I don't know
where we are.

31:37.238 --> 31:38.533
When we get to
the stop sign,

31:39.196 --> 31:40.321
turn left, all right?

31:40.328 --> 31:41.183
Take a left.

31:42.018 --> 31:43.181
Which way is left?

31:45.256 --> 31:46.850
Hold up your hands...

31:48.686 --> 31:50.010
stick out your thumbs.

31:51.615 --> 31:53.330
The one that makes the L,

31:54.116 --> 31:55.403
that's your left.

32:08.665 --> 32:09.950
Get your hands off me!

32:17.375 --> 32:18.581
Do something, will you?

32:21.938 --> 32:23.880
County Edwards!
Carl! Carl!

32:27.376 --> 32:28.960
Stop it right now!

32:30.015 --> 32:32.283
Yeah, Morty, I'm
talking to you!

32:34.795 --> 32:35.910
Michael Stevenson.

32:36.778 --> 32:38.331
Carl Meeks... Carl!

32:40.846 --> 32:42.793
Why are you turning
on each other?

32:43.415 --> 32:45.403
Stealing from
your neighbors?

32:46.458 --> 32:48.711
You are fighting
the wrong people!

32:50.085 --> 32:52.180
We are literally
in the dark.

32:53.007 --> 32:57.921
All I'm saying is that I-I
think we need to get organized.

32:58.436 --> 32:59.252
I...

33:01.597 --> 33:03.150
I don't know
where the mayor is,

33:03.628 --> 33:06.091
but maybe it's time we came
up with a plan ourselves.

33:06.278 --> 33:06.773
What's going on, Gray?

33:06.778 --> 33:07.942
We making speeches?

33:08.915 --> 33:11.292
With all due
respect, Mr. Mayor

33:11.298 --> 33:12.333
we have a missing bus,

33:12.578 --> 33:13.581
no police,

33:13.936 --> 33:15.960
firemen doing
policemen's job.

33:15.966 --> 33:17.522
--How dare you politicize
it! --Eric. Eric.

33:17.525 --> 33:19.002
I'm not talking
to my opponent

33:19.006 --> 33:20.642
I'm talking to my mayor.

33:21.047 --> 33:22.300
Now, I don't care
about the election

33:22.308 --> 33:23.471
I care about survival.

33:23.477 --> 33:25.160
We just might be
on our own here,

33:25.316 --> 33:28.042
and I need to know what
my mayor intends to do!

33:29.368 --> 33:31.501
Folks, I know we've been
through a lot tonight.

33:32.345 --> 33:32.940
I want to tell
you something.

33:32.947 --> 33:34.190
I've been to
big cities and

33:34.195 --> 33:35.232
I've been to
foreign countries,

33:35.235 --> 33:38.511
--but I will take the good people of-- --The
good people of Jericho over any other city

33:38.518 --> 33:40.472
we know, Mr. Mayor,
we've heard the speech.

33:40.478 --> 33:41.692
Well, Shep, I hope
you don't think

33:41.697 --> 33:43.370
I've been asleep
at the switch.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.801
We had all hoped
this was an accident

33:46.806 --> 33:49.061
but the
unfortunate truth is

33:49.067 --> 33:50.900
there was another
explosion in Atlanta.

33:50.907 --> 33:52.270
--What?
--Oh, my God.

33:52.595 --> 33:56.533
--I been busy trying to contact the governor.
--Yeah? Well, what if the governor's dead?

33:56.538 --> 33:59.932
There is no report of
anything happening in Topeka.

33:59.498 --> 34:01.923
--How are we going to get reports
without television? --Or no phones?

34:02.256 --> 34:03.303
What about New York?

34:03.305 --> 34:06.501
--We don't know anything about New York.
--When are we going to get the power back on?

34:06.265 --> 34:08.620
--Is the drinking water
okay? --One at a time, please.

34:08.985 --> 34:11.721
--Calm down. --Calm down?
My boy is still out there.

34:11.728 --> 34:13.071
The sheriff is
out there right now

34:13.076 --> 34:15.141
looking for your
boy and my boy.

34:15.148 --> 34:17.400
What if we had more
police officers out there?

34:17.065 --> 34:19.409
--We need to know what you're going
to do now. --No one can answer that.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.960
Help them! Help them!

34:41.215 --> 34:42.101
It's Stacy.

34:43.466 --> 34:44.793
Hey, there, little one.

34:45.398 --> 34:47.721
--You're okay.
--I got you.

34:50.067 --> 34:51.112
What's your name?

34:51.706 --> 34:54.071
--Heather.
--Jake.

34:55.916 --> 35:01.250
--Nice to meet you,
Jake. --You, too.

35:01.747 --> 35:02.560
Mommy!

35:03.288 --> 35:05.450
--I missed you so
much. --I love you.

35:12.747 --> 35:13.762
Hey, Buddy.

35:14.107 --> 35:16.401
Dad, there was
this deer...

35:19.476 --> 35:20.650
Mommy's right here.

35:20.795 --> 35:21.842
I'm right here, honey.

35:22.358 --> 35:23.710
Everything's
going to be okay.

35:26.057 --> 35:28.862
--Jake.
--Mom.

35:29.188 --> 35:31.811
--Oh, your face.
--I'll be all right.

35:31.815 --> 35:33.151
--Oh, honey.
--You okay?

35:33.397 --> 35:34.493
Of course.

35:35.156 --> 35:36.562
Eric, help your brother.

35:42.257 --> 35:45.571
--Put your arm around
me. --Careful. Careful.

35:50.485 --> 35:51.490
Easy. Easy.

35:52.407 --> 35:53.182
Okay.

35:53.498 --> 35:56.081
--Eric, get April. We'll meet
you the medical center. --Okay.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.772
Hey, hey, there's an
empty prison bus out there.

35:58.955 --> 36:01.090
--Whereabouts?
--Cedar Run.

36:01.365 --> 36:02.062
All right, just relax.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.113
I'll take care of it.

36:03.877 --> 36:07.362
--God! Look at you.
You're a mess. --It's fine.

36:07.368 --> 36:10.170
--Stop worrying about me.
--Well, good luck with that.

36:18.728 --> 36:19.932
Hey, Shep?

36:22.707 --> 36:25.391
You said earlier that you
had heard that speech before.

36:26.407 --> 36:28.503
Ever ask yourself
why I say it?

36:29.956 --> 36:31.361
'Cause I happen to
trust you people.

36:33.718 --> 36:34.841
'Cause I love my town.

36:36.285 --> 36:38.693
Now, something happened
in Denver, in Atlanta,

36:39.675 --> 36:41.293
and it could be
that we wake up

36:41.418 --> 36:43.122
and we find out that's
where it stopped.

36:43.496 --> 36:44.620
But, until we know,

36:45.796 --> 36:48.270
are we going to use our
imaginations to solve problems

36:48.275 --> 36:49.560
or to cause them?

36:53.197 --> 36:55.720
We can find out how
big this thing is.

36:56.588 --> 36:58.341
If we have to,
we can fight.

36:58.348 --> 36:59.203
We can fight anybody.

36:59.336 --> 37:01.000
We can fight all enemies.

37:02.445 --> 37:04.310
The only way that's
going to happen

37:04.316 --> 37:05.951
is if we work together.

37:08.307 --> 37:09.270
Now, go on home.

37:10.636 --> 37:13.473
We'll meet tomorrow
at the town hall.

37:15.736 --> 37:16.591
And, folks,

37:19.325 --> 37:21.231
don't you break
my heart again.

37:25.657 --> 37:32.270
Chief, keep all the men at their posts
until the sheriff gets back. Hey, Shep.

37:37.875 --> 37:40.130
I was afraid I was never
going to see you again.

37:42.045 --> 37:44.612
Come on. You think I'd
let Dad have the last word?

37:45.547 --> 37:46.402
Hey.

37:47.156 --> 37:48.330
Quit talking about me.

37:52.765 --> 37:54.673
You did a great thing
out there tonight.

37:56.755 --> 37:57.811
Thanks.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.601
Your grandfather
would have been proud.

38:11.965 --> 38:14.172
I'm going to go see what's
taking these guys so long.

38:20.737 --> 38:22.472
You know, I go
away for a few years

38:22.476 --> 38:24.192
and the town
goes to hell.

38:30.076 --> 38:31.552
I'm glad you're home.

38:33.547 --> 38:34.633
Yeah, we'll see.

38:46.096 --> 38:46.911
What are you thinking?

38:47.886 --> 38:50.640
I was just wondering what it was all
going to look like in the morning.

39:19.047 --> 39:24.422
(I'll sing it one
last time for you)

39:25.825 --> 39:30.381
(Then we really
have to go)

39:31.875 --> 39:36.700
(You've been the only
thing that's right)

39:38.158 --> 39:40.782
(In all I've done...)

39:40.486 --> 39:41.421
What's happening?

39:46.527 --> 39:49.291
(Light up, light up)

39:50.276 --> 39:55.221
(As if you have a choice)

39:55.578 --> 39:58.330
(even if you
cannot hear... )
