WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:03.150
<i>Erstwhile on</i> Fargo...

00:03.240 --> 00:04.833
The blackmail,
I'm gonna pay it.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.750
<i>Blood and locusts...</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:08.240
<i>The Book of Exodus.</i>

00:09.160 --> 00:10.276
God is watching
and He knows.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.556
Knows what?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.912
Pick me up in an hour.
We'll get the money.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.196
He's gonna pay?
A million dollars?

00:17.280 --> 00:19.749
Did you mean to
lock me in here?

00:19.840 --> 00:21.433
We got a big day tomorrow.
Get some rest.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.510
That's Sam Hess.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.670
I mean,
you think this could be,

00:23.800 --> 00:24.950
like, an organized
crime thing?

00:25.040 --> 00:26.030
We're from Fargo.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.873
You're gonna find him, right?
The guy who did it.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.189
<i>I need a name.</i>

00:29.280 --> 00:30.953
Malvo. Malvo.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.116
Lorne Malvo?

00:32.240 --> 00:35.119
<i>He killed him.
He killed Hess.</i>

01:55.560 --> 01:58.598
So, anyway,
this freakin' guy...

01:58.720 --> 02:01.360
The women are
in the box, yeah?

02:01.440 --> 02:03.636
Customs seal on.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.871
Eighteen cubic tons metric
at $110 an ounce...

02:05.960 --> 02:07.110
And he decides--
Oi!

02:07.200 --> 02:08.190
...stepped twice.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.000
Soy sauce...
and another Mai Tai.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.032
Mai Tai? Mai Tai?
...minus labor,
minus packaging,

02:13.120 --> 02:15.999
minus extra-governmental
operating costs.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.039
Anyhoo, he decides
he's in love
with one of 'em.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.033
...yield so far,
9,000 unique
credit card numbers,

02:22.160 --> 02:25.039
with a credit limit of
approximately $1.1 million,

02:25.120 --> 02:28.830
minus real estate,
minus labor, minus R&D.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.280
Sam Hess.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.035
Assets deployed,
Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.760
Three days plus
lodging plus mileage.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.310
You want the...

02:51.120 --> 02:52.952
Bottom line,
they don't think...

02:53.080 --> 02:57.279
Our guys, they said...
doesn't look related
to the business.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.319
Could be extra-marital...
on the wife's side.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.278
So... now, they're en route
to a second location

03:05.360 --> 03:09.752
to apprehend who we...
think is responsible.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.353
Dead.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.270
What's that?

03:16.120 --> 03:18.351
Not apprehend, dead.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.036
Don't care extra-marital.
Don't care not related.

03:22.120 --> 03:25.272
Kill and be killed.
Head in a bag.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.113
There's the message.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.990
Of course, boss. Yeah.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.152
Nineteen-hundred
units shipped by rail
at a cost of $600 per

03:35.240 --> 03:38.119
plus customs
plus extra
government expenses.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.280
Good evening,
ladies. Good...

03:44.480 --> 03:47.279
Welcome, ladies,
to Turkish Delight...

03:48.880 --> 03:53.193
to Turkish Delight...
where your wish...

03:53.280 --> 03:56.910
your wish is our command.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.840
Time to make the call.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.517
No, I mean... you know...
Maybe I don't
wanna now, you know.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.829
'Cause... That's...
maybe... maybe

04:14.960 --> 04:16.154
something got broken
there in the night,

04:16.240 --> 04:18.994
you know... something...
something
important like trust.

04:19.079 --> 04:24.280
You know, maybe...
we need to revisit
who gets how much here.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.829
What's in the bags?

04:26.920 --> 04:30.038
Look... okay, here's
what I'm thinking. I'm
thinking 60-40, all right?

04:30.120 --> 04:31.270
You know,
with me getting, you know...

04:31.360 --> 04:34.239
Because, you know,
am I or am I not
doing all the...

04:34.320 --> 04:37.438
What about
the voice thingy there?

04:41.360 --> 04:44.273
<i>"Luke... I am your father--"</i>

04:44.360 --> 04:45.589
Ow!

04:45.840 --> 04:47.354
Stop screwing around.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.669
What...

04:51.760 --> 04:52.750
"Luke."

04:52.840 --> 04:54.638
I think you broke it.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.677
So about that
60-40 split there,
you know, I'm...

05:01.760 --> 05:04.753
Hey, why is there
paper on the windows?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.680
Word for word.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.280
You really want me
to say all this?

06:07.760 --> 06:09.035
Yeah.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.636
<i>"Once upon a time,
there was a little boy.</i>

06:12.720 --> 06:15.792
He was born in a field
and raised in the woods...

06:15.880 --> 06:17.360
and he had nothing.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.915
In the winter,
the boy would freeze...

06:20.040 --> 06:22.475
and in the summer,
he would boil.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.280
He knew the name
of every stinging insect.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.273
At night, he would
look at the lights
in the houses

06:28.360 --> 06:29.555
and he would want.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.520
<i>Why was he outside
and they in?</i>

06:34.600 --> 06:38.230
<i>Why was he so hungry
and they fed?</i>

06:38.320 --> 06:40.437
<i>'It should be me, ' he said.</i>

06:40.520 --> 06:44.514
<i>And out of the darkness,
the wolves came, whispering.</i>

06:47.000 --> 06:49.469
<i>Do you understand
what I'm saying?"</i>

06:52.840 --> 06:54.718
Yeah.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.634
<i>"Gustafson Parking Garage,
high noon."</i>

07:13.960 --> 07:17.670
Well... did it sound like
he was gonna pay?

07:17.760 --> 07:19.240
I don't know what
that sounds like.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.472
So is the Greek the boy or...

07:25.520 --> 07:28.479
Give me that duffel over
there and I'll tell you.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.150
Hey...

07:35.520 --> 07:38.035
what's with
all the duct tape?

07:45.560 --> 07:48.029
<i>Tellin' you, folks, things
are shaping up to make this</i>

07:48.120 --> 07:50.635
<i>one of the worst blizzards
in Minnesota history.</i>

07:50.720 --> 07:52.677
<i>A perfect storm
or what have you.</i>

07:52.760 --> 07:54.672
<i>This is definitely
one for the record books.</i>

07:54.760 --> 07:55.750
<i>That's right, Norm.</i>

07:55.840 --> 07:58.435
<i>And expect white outs
and blizzard-like conditions</i>

07:58.520 --> 08:01.080
<i>as this system moves
quickly down from Canada.</i>

08:01.160 --> 08:04.392
<i>Also,
expect poor road conditions
and even closures.</i>

08:04.480 --> 08:08.633
<i>So, folks,
please avoid driving today
unless you absolutely have to.</i>

08:08.720 --> 08:10.279
<i>Gosh, I...
avoid going out...</i>

08:26.960 --> 08:28.792
Starting to come
down out there.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.315
"Storm of the century,"
they're sayin'.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.357
Is Greta here?

08:33.440 --> 08:37.400
No, she's at a friend's.
Thought it would be safer.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.320
Um...

08:40.080 --> 08:41.116
You didn't have to come.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.840
I was coming anyway.
Told you last night.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.952
Just left
a little earlier is all.

08:46.040 --> 08:49.556
So... you really think
this Malvo fella
was at your apartment?

08:49.640 --> 08:51.199
Not at the apartment,
outside.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.795
My neighbor,
he does the watch.

08:53.880 --> 08:57.351
He said he saw this fella
sitting in his car
outside the apartment.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.274
May even have
followed me here,
I'm thinking.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.079
So the neighbor, Jewish fella,

09:02.160 --> 09:05.437
he gives the guy a warning,
you know,
a kind of, "Move along."

09:05.520 --> 09:08.592
Said the fella was
real menacing in return.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.956
Had a police scanner, he said.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.951
Talked about how
maybe he was gonna...

09:14.040 --> 09:16.316
come back and kill
the neighbor and his family.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.390
Oh, jeez.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.549
Did you call it in?

09:19.640 --> 09:24.840
Well, see... I don't think
they'd believe me
is the thing.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.314
I mean, not after, you know,

09:26.400 --> 09:29.120
I arrest the wrong fella,
being what they think.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.600
So there's that.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.478
He get a plate number,
your neighbor?

09:32.560 --> 09:33.880
Yeah, yeah. He...

09:34.960 --> 09:36.280
I called it in.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.671
SUV of some type...
company car.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.035
Which company?

09:41.120 --> 09:43.555
The grocery chain, you know,
"July in January."

09:43.640 --> 09:44.710
Phoenix Farms.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.910
Right.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.639
Which...

09:47.720 --> 09:52.033
This Malvo fella
saying he's a pastor...

09:52.120 --> 09:55.397
so not sure
the connection there.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.757
Well, maybe
we should drive over,
see what they say.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.116
Yeah. Let me get changed.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.113
Morning, Mr. Creech.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.193
And how're
we feeling there,
Mr. Nygaard?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.113
Oh, yeah.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.795
Real good.
Ready to go home.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.678
Well, now,
that's up to him, I suppose.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.871
So how's your pain level
on a scale of one to 10?

10:39.960 --> 10:41.713
Yeah, not bad.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.393
So maybe a three?

10:44.640 --> 10:45.756
Hmm?

10:46.840 --> 10:50.993
What... What's with...
Why's there
a police officer outside?

10:51.080 --> 10:53.197
Not for me to say, is it?

10:58.360 --> 11:02.673
Okay, Mr. Creech, I'll be
back to take you to
Radiology in 10 minutes.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.594
I'm... I'm his brother Chaz.
Chaz Nygaard.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.270
Lester... it's me.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.750
Hey.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.635
What did you do?

11:48.720 --> 11:50.279
When?
Come on, Lester.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.960
There's a deputy
outside the door,
for Pete's sake.

11:53.960 --> 11:59.115
I just... cut my hand
on a... some rusty nail.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.795
Not sure how that involves
local law enforcement.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.237
They said you were there
when the Police Chief
got murdered.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.959
Well, heck.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.589
I think I'd remember that.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.631
Unless... I don't know,
with the head injury,
maybe...

12:15.720 --> 12:16.710
'Cause lying...

12:16.840 --> 12:19.309
You're lying.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.390
Says who?

12:20.480 --> 12:22.551
That cop, the female,
says you are a suspect.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.313
Suspect of what?
Murder...

12:24.400 --> 12:27.837
for Pearl, the Chief...
even Sam Hess.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.077
That is crazy
is what that is.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.231
I'm the victim! Me!

12:32.320 --> 12:35.597
He came to my house. They...

12:35.680 --> 12:36.670
I almost died.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.075
Did you tell her that?

12:38.200 --> 12:39.520
Don't lie to me!

12:41.440 --> 12:44.274
I took you in. My house...

12:44.360 --> 12:46.272
This is...
Around my kid...

12:46.360 --> 12:47.589
Oh, boy.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.433
Oh, boy. Classic.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.795
Cops can't
figure out who did it,

12:50.920 --> 12:52.195
so they start
throwing blame around.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.356
You said
you were kidnapped.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.512
You called me in a meeting,
said you were
mixed up in something.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.279
That was-- I told you
I was just pranking you.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.874
No, you said you were
in the trunk of a car.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.111
Said a couple of
fellas grabbed you.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.715
What are you
mixed up in, Lester?
What the heck is goin' on?

13:04.800 --> 13:06.996
Chaz, I swear to you,
this is all just a...

13:09.680 --> 13:12.798
Heck, you're my brother.
You should be on my side.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.712
People are dead, Lester.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.110
Your own wife.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.556
A... a conspiracy,
they're sayin'.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.520
Like... like... like... maybe
you hired a fella to... to...

13:29.320 --> 13:31.391
To...

13:31.520 --> 13:33.079
what?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.873
Come on.

13:37.240 --> 13:41.712
Chaz, I swear to God...
I did not do this... anything.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.230
Well, they think you did...
or know who did,

13:44.360 --> 13:48.400
so... so... you gotta
give 'em something...
someone.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.598
If you want this to go away,
you gotta give 'em someone.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.710
Chaz... buddy, come on.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.360
This is...

14:02.440 --> 14:04.909
You have got to
stand by me here.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.953
You've been a burden
my whole life.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.434
I'm done.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.277
There's something
wrong with you, Lester.
There's something missing.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.554
You're not right
in the world.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.960
Chaz.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.917
Okay, here's
Mr. Creech's charts.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.756
Are we ready, Mr. Creech?

16:54.280 --> 16:57.876
Okay, Mr. Creech,
someone will be out
for you in a minute.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.839
So he had a shotgun pellet
in his hand this whole time?

18:59.920 --> 19:02.719
Lester? Yeah.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.837
Which means he wasn't
knocked out in the basement

19:04.920 --> 19:06.877
like he said he was.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.872
So maybe...

19:09.000 --> 19:12.516
maybe he and Malvo
weren't foes there
at the end.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.276
Maybe... they colluded
on this whole thing.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.315
Hmm.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.031
Welcome to Phoenix Farms!

19:25.120 --> 19:26.918
Hiya. We're
police officers.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.878
You sure are.
This about the bugs?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.076
Sorry?

19:30.240 --> 19:31.310
The bugs. The...
What do you...

19:31.440 --> 19:33.193
Locust?

19:33.280 --> 19:35.954
Or wait. Maybe we're not
supposed to tell people.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.680
Dave, are we telling people
about the bugs?

19:38.760 --> 19:41.912
Is there a manager
or someone we can talk to?

19:42.000 --> 19:43.639
Not sure anybody's in yet.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.279
Dave, anybody in
the offices yet?

19:45.400 --> 19:46.880
Let me check.

19:48.160 --> 19:52.598
<i>Mr. Cosmopolis to
Customer Service.</i>

20:11.480 --> 20:14.632
Okay, then...
I'm gonna leave my card.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.234
Deputy Solverson.

20:16.360 --> 20:19.159
We're here
about a company car,
who's driving it.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.033
The license number
there on the back.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.873
When a manager gets in,
just have him call.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.679
Okay, sure. Thanks
for stopping by.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.519
Thanks.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.478
So what do
we do now then?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.518
I could use
another cup of coffee.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.796
<i>Please take your ticket.</i>

21:09.480 --> 21:10.834
<i>Oh, God.</i>

21:14.720 --> 21:17.235
<i>Oh, God, my God.</i>

21:30.120 --> 21:31.110
What?

21:31.200 --> 21:33.112
Kid's
getting restless.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.031
<i>How's he doing?</i>

21:37.120 --> 21:39.954
He's baffled...
just like me.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.713
Did you make the drop?

21:42.640 --> 21:43.835
No.

21:43.920 --> 21:47.960
<i>It's not too late
to get off the pot.
It's a lot of damn money.</i>

21:48.040 --> 21:51.590
It's not about the money.
It's bigger than the...

21:51.680 --> 21:54.559
<i>Thank you, God.</i>

21:57.280 --> 22:00.000
<i>Than what?</i>

22:00.080 --> 22:02.515
I know what I gotta do now.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.752
Give me an hour
and head back.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.480
Tell the damn kid...

22:08.560 --> 22:09.994
I love him.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.595
<i>Yeah, I'm...
I'm not gonna say that.</i>

22:18.840 --> 22:21.799
Pack your shit.
We're heading home.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.479
Was that my dad?

22:30.440 --> 22:31.794
Ticket, please.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.594
I changed my mind.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.273
I decided...

22:36.360 --> 22:39.034
God, He told me.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.157
He has different plans.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.717
God told you not to park here?

22:44.840 --> 22:47.400
No, no, no.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.597
I know what I have to
do now. I didn't before.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.837
Well, sir, I gotta...

22:51.960 --> 22:54.031
It's $2 for
the first 30 minutes, so...

22:54.120 --> 22:55.873
Son, do you go to church?
Yes, sir.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.839
Then open the goddamn gate.
Your Lord demands it.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.077
Two-faced.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.350
What's that?

23:13.480 --> 23:14.470
Oh...

23:15.200 --> 23:18.477
When someone's a liar,
that's what you... you say.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.519
"He's two-faced."

23:21.640 --> 23:23.632
Like, he's got one face
for telling the truth

23:23.760 --> 23:25.319
and another for...

23:27.320 --> 23:30.438
I guess that's what...
bothers me the most,
you know.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.149
Not the violence and
the murders and all?

23:34.280 --> 23:38.354
Well... of course that...
but, I mean...

23:40.160 --> 23:44.677
When a dog goes rabid,
right, there's no mistaking
it for a normal dog.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.476
And here we are.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.349
We're supposed to be...
you know, us people...

23:51.480 --> 23:53.472
we're supposed
to know better...

23:53.560 --> 23:56.314
to be better, you know?

24:01.360 --> 24:04.956
It must be hard to
live in this world
if you believe that.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.997
You have no idea.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.034
<i>620, be aware. Possible
313 in progress,</i>

24:13.360 --> 24:14.476
<i>Bishop and Main.</i>

24:16.600 --> 24:19.672
<i>Roger from
Dispatch. We're sitting
around Willow Creek...</i>

24:22.600 --> 24:26.560
<i>8434, base.
I'm gonna go ahead
and cancel this thing.</i>

24:46.600 --> 24:49.479
Thought about it.
The 60-40 thing
doesn't work for me.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.319
<i>All right,</i>

24:51.440 --> 24:53.397
<i>I'm gonna take it to north,
in case he shows up
down the block.</i>

24:54.080 --> 24:56.675
<i>Dispatch
to 121 1 Mint.</i>

24:56.760 --> 24:58.240
<i>121 1 Mint. Roger.</i>

25:08.880 --> 25:14.000
<i>A 172. Tenth
and Market to code four.
Can I get a case number?</i>

25:14.080 --> 25:15.434
Hey. Hey!

25:34.280 --> 25:36.875
In case Stavros
does call the cops...

25:36.960 --> 25:39.270
we wanna make sure
they're too busy to respond.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.436
That's part one.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.270
Mmm-mmm.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.310
Part two is...

26:10.320 --> 26:13.233
have you ever had
Turkish Delight?

26:13.320 --> 26:14.640
It's disgusting.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.838
That's okay.
I'd be insulted
if you didn't try.

26:27.240 --> 26:29.038
<i>Roger that.</i>

26:29.120 --> 26:31.635
<i>One citation, one...</i>

26:39.080 --> 26:43.677
<i>A 172. Tenth
and Market to code four.
Can I get a case number?</i>

26:48.000 --> 26:49.354
No!

27:02.520 --> 27:05.957
<i>All units,
shots fired. Beacon near
Bundy. I repeat, shots fired.</i>

27:06.040 --> 27:08.680
<i>Car 1-7 in the area.
Responding.</i>

28:22.600 --> 28:24.114
Ow!

29:30.800 --> 29:32.029
Mr. Creech?

30:01.080 --> 30:02.230
Hello?

30:03.840 --> 30:05.069
Anyone there?

32:41.560 --> 32:44.029
No TV until
you do your homework.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.873
Just don't go there.
You know that.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.634
Wash your hands first.
Did.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.554
Yeah? When?
Between the car
and the house?

33:36.480 --> 33:39.871
So this fella gives away
all his money and a kidney

33:39.960 --> 33:41.394
and then he kills himself?

33:41.480 --> 33:43.836
That's what he said,
my neighbor.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.911
Why didn't the fella
just go work for a charity?

33:49.000 --> 33:50.070
Got me.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.438
Probably close the roads
soon, if you're
gonna head back.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.318
Still gotta take
a look at Lester's car.

33:58.400 --> 34:02.189
Maybe take another run
at Phoenix Farms,
I'm thinking.

34:02.280 --> 34:05.671
Try to get an ID
on that company car.

34:05.760 --> 34:09.036
Don't much like this fella
threatening people.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.389
Never wanted to
be a cop, you know.

34:17.560 --> 34:20.473
I mean...
some kids grow up
thinking about it,

34:20.560 --> 34:22.233
but not me.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.553
And your dream was what then?

34:26.719 --> 34:29.188
You're gonna think
it's funny, but...

34:29.280 --> 34:31.431
I always wanted to
work for the Post Office...

34:32.360 --> 34:33.953
and be a mailman.

34:35.880 --> 34:39.271
I like that you get to see
the same people every day...

34:39.360 --> 34:42.273
bring 'em that check
they've been waiting for...

34:43.639 --> 34:48.032
and presents for Christmas...
be part of the community.

34:49.199 --> 34:54.036
But... when I applied,
they were on
a hiring freeze.

34:54.120 --> 34:57.112
Then this pal from
high school tells me
the local PD is hiring,

34:57.240 --> 34:59.311
so I took the bus downtown.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.472
Never thought they'd,
you know... they'd take me.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.153
So why try?

35:06.520 --> 35:09.194
Well, you know...

35:09.280 --> 35:10.555
Greta's mom passed

35:10.640 --> 35:14.350
and she was the one
with the paycheck, so...

35:22.400 --> 35:24.198
Oh, jeez.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.749
I wonder what that's about.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.720
<i>All Tac units arrived after
me. Repeat, Tac team...</i>

35:42.360 --> 35:44.750
I don't want to
die in this way.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.438
How bad?

35:49.520 --> 35:52.911
Sir, multiple shots fired,
property damage.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.390
No injury reports
at this time...

35:55.480 --> 35:57.790
and perps are still
thought to be inside.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.075
Multiple?

35:59.240 --> 36:00.469
Unclear at this time.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.073
<i>To the individual
or individuals
inside the house.</i>

36:09.160 --> 36:12.597
<i>This is Lieutenant Schmidt,
Duluth Police Department.</i>

36:13.560 --> 36:15.916
<i>I'm ordering you to
throw out your weapon</i>

36:16.040 --> 36:18.430
<i>and come out with
your hands up...</i>

36:18.520 --> 36:20.716
<i>or we'll start blasting.</i>

36:30.240 --> 36:31.993
Move!

36:32.080 --> 36:34.800
<i>Roger that.
Tac team 2 is on the move.</i>

36:34.920 --> 36:37.594
<i>On the move.
Divide and conquer on three.</i>

36:37.680 --> 36:40.115
<i>Divide and conquer on three.
Over.</i>

36:43.520 --> 36:44.670
No!

36:44.760 --> 36:46.240
Shots fired!

36:46.360 --> 36:47.874
Go, go, go!

36:47.960 --> 36:49.838
They're shooting!
Shot's fired!

36:49.920 --> 36:53.231
<i>Shots fired!
Engage! Engage!</i>

36:58.640 --> 37:00.154
No!

37:17.800 --> 37:20.474
<i>Shots fired.
Repeat, shots fired.</i>

37:20.600 --> 37:21.750
<i>Cease fire!</i>

37:21.840 --> 37:23.240
Cease fire, damn it!

37:32.280 --> 37:34.317
I think we got him.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.437
Based on what? ESP?

37:36.520 --> 37:38.910
Breach!

38:04.240 --> 38:06.038
Wait!

38:21.400 --> 38:22.390
Gun!

38:59.440 --> 39:02.672
<i>Suspect is down.
Repeat, suspect is down.</i>

39:02.760 --> 39:05.070
<i>Oddest suicide
by cop I ever...</i>

40:02.920 --> 40:06.277
They're shooting up
the block. It's goddamn
World War III.

40:06.360 --> 40:07.396
Call 911.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.150
No, wait!

40:13.240 --> 40:14.674
This is Grimly.

40:14.760 --> 40:18.310
Shots fired,
Fourth and Hunter.
Requesting backup.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.476
What do you think?

42:11.600 --> 42:13.592
Accident, I guess.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.911
Words exchanged,
differences.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.356
Heck of a lot of bullets
for a fender bender.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.955
No, wait!
We should wait for...

42:41.160 --> 42:42.116
Who?

42:46.720 --> 42:48.234
Who?
God!

42:48.520 --> 42:50.079
Damn it!

42:50.480 --> 42:51.880
Fargo!

43:13.880 --> 43:15.360
Here!

43:24.920 --> 43:26.354
One down!

43:36.720 --> 43:38.439
He's dead, I think!

44:04.960 --> 44:07.111
Freeze! Police officer!

44:14.000 --> 44:15.639
Halt!

45:14.600 --> 45:16.796
<i>Just
a horrible time to be
on the roads, guys.</i>

45:16.880 --> 45:18.712
<i>And I don't
recall any time, Kim...</i>

45:18.800 --> 45:23.238
<i>Unless you get
a serious blizzard
like '96 or even into '93.</i>

45:23.320 --> 45:26.313
<i>...where we have had so many
interstates shut down...</i>

47:41.480 --> 47:43.153
Let there be light, huh?

47:47.160 --> 47:49.834
What the heck was that?

47:50.960 --> 47:53.429
What... Jeez.

47:53.520 --> 47:54.874
God! Fish!

47:54.960 --> 47:56.440
Jeez!

49:03.240 --> 49:05.152
Buddy?

49:08.960 --> 49:10.110
Buddy?

49:11.600 --> 49:12.954
Dmitri?

49:28.840 --> 49:30.399
I gave it back.

49:34.280 --> 49:35.600
I gave it back!

49:49.960 --> 49:51.189
Mr. Creech.

49:55.520 --> 49:56.920
Mr. Creech.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.118
Oh, thank gosh.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.999
There you are, Mr. Creech.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.799
Thought we'd lost you.
