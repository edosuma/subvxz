WEBVTT

00:05.555 --> 00:09.515
This way for the Chatsworth
Express. Come and watch pikeys
making a mess of their lives.

00:13.915 --> 00:18.475
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:18.475 --> 00:24.315
What sounds on earth could ever
replace kids needing money,

00:24.315 --> 00:26.554
or wives in your face?

00:26.554 --> 00:29.554
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included

00:29.554 --> 00:33.194
is why pubs or drugs
were kindly invented,

00:33.194 --> 00:36.554
to calm us all down,
stop us going mental.

00:36.554 --> 00:41.394
These are Chatsworth estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.394 --> 00:46.874
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:46.874 --> 00:51.034
You shit on our head,
but you pay the taxes!

00:52.674 --> 00:55.434
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth's buccaneers,

00:55.434 --> 00:58.354
who'll come on your face
for the price of a beer.

01:00.274 --> 01:02.434
Make poverty history!

01:02.434 --> 01:04.194
Cheaper drugs now!

01:04.194 --> 01:09.074
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:09.074 --> 01:11.514
(LAUGHING) Scatter!

01:11.514 --> 01:14.154
Party!

01:17.633 --> 01:21.193
'Photographs can do the total
opposite of jogging your memory.

01:21.193 --> 01:22.593
'The second you press click,

01:22.593 --> 01:25.993
'you sacrifice the right
to recollections.

01:25.993 --> 01:30.913
'You can stare at a picture till
doomsday, but you won't smell smells,

01:30.913 --> 01:35.353
'won't hear voices, and all the
rumpy-pumpy surrounding the snapshot.

01:35.353 --> 01:37.073
'They say the camera never lies.

01:37.073 --> 01:43.073
'Photos, though, maim any memory
beyond their thin, white frames.

01:43.073 --> 01:44.633
'I wish I'd known this sooner.'

01:50.073 --> 01:53.273
We did not ensure the
horrors of childbirth seven times

01:53.273 --> 01:55.233
to populate this lonely planet!

01:55.233 --> 02:01.233
And I did not work my fingers to
the bone, both inside and outside,

02:01.233 --> 02:03.833
putting food on our table,

02:03.833 --> 02:07.193
nor zig-zag through the most
ham-fisted civil war in history,

02:07.193 --> 02:10.832
to have to take it right
up the shitter

02:10.832 --> 02:13.712
paying for these devil's dildos!

02:17.112 --> 02:19.232
You were on the phone with Auntie
Mags for hours doing the crossword.

02:19.232 --> 02:21.312
Zambia won't be cheap, will it?

02:21.312 --> 02:25.552
Argh! Yeah, well, she's my sister,
and I miss her.

02:25.552 --> 02:28.832
And nobody should have to pay
to speak to a fuckin' nun!

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.552 --> 02:41.792
Not their fault
you've not been invited.

02:42.592 --> 02:44.712
Zizzy's funeral.

02:44.712 --> 02:46.632
Me? At Zizzy Ahmed's funeral?

02:46.632 --> 02:50.192
Same Zizzy poached my slot-machines
racket while I'm in the slammer?

02:50.192 --> 02:54.512
Same Zizzy Ahmed I lent ten grand to
to pay for his wedding?

02:54.512 --> 02:57.192
The cellmate who saved
your life on the rotunda.

02:58.072 --> 03:01.151
Now, dead...Zizzy.

03:01.151 --> 03:04.191
Making him the second one. Bam!

03:04.191 --> 03:06.031
Gone.

03:06.031 --> 03:09.431
Ring Sunita, ask her if you can go.

03:09.431 --> 03:12.471
Can't, don't know where my phone is.

03:21.591 --> 03:23.151
Haven't got a suit black enough.

03:23.151 --> 03:24.391
They're Indians.

03:25.151 --> 03:28.471
You've that shirt we bought in
Benidorm they'd love you for.

03:39.631 --> 03:42.591
Plus, new rule, elbows off the table

03:42.591 --> 03:44.751
while the telly's on,
starting Monday.

03:44.751 --> 03:48.431
Right, everybody got, before
I sit down for a bit of me time?

03:49.510 --> 03:50.790
Fuck!

03:50.790 --> 03:52.150
What's up?

03:52.150 --> 03:55.910
All three unis offered
full bursaries, all three!

03:55.910 --> 03:57.750
So, is that it?

03:57.750 --> 03:58.990
Going to Durham? When?

03:58.990 --> 04:01.990
Nottingham, we decided.

04:01.990 --> 04:04.830
Council house students
on full bursary, statistically,

04:04.830 --> 04:06.990
are more likely to die
under the age of 25.

04:06.990 --> 04:09.310
Ian! That's horrible.

04:09.310 --> 04:12.750
They're not used to the money,
always waving it about,
magnets for muggings.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.470
So, the coursework nosedives,

04:14.470 --> 04:16.910
bus straight back
to council-house heaven.

04:16.910 --> 04:17.790
Why is that going to kill anyone?

04:17.790 --> 04:20.750
What, getting twatted from
all mates they left behind?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.950
Different accents,
and using big words?

04:26.870 --> 04:28.030
Well done, mate.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.710
And you. Come here.

04:38.710 --> 04:41.429
You told me these
were all rejections.

04:41.429 --> 04:43.229
So, what?

04:43.229 --> 04:45.989
They changed their minds? All three?

04:45.989 --> 04:49.349
Or were you just bullshitting me,
cos if you were, we need

04:49.349 --> 04:51.669
to talk about this,
cos I feel a bit left out.

04:51.669 --> 04:54.909
I wasn't going to go
if I didn't get the money.

04:56.549 --> 04:57.309
Which...

04:57.309 --> 04:58.669
I told him to.

04:58.669 --> 04:59.669
Me and all.

04:59.669 --> 05:00.669
We all did.

05:06.269 --> 05:09.189
We're not struggling,
just for my sake.

05:10.789 --> 05:12.789
How clever is he then?

05:12.789 --> 05:15.629
Tell your daddy how proud you are.

05:15.629 --> 05:17.109
Clever Daddy.

05:30.869 --> 05:33.228
Why are yous all crying?

05:33.228 --> 05:34.748
It's what he wanted.

05:39.828 --> 05:44.068
How does a guy not feel threatened
by mortality when he's lost two

05:44.068 --> 05:47.628
ex-closest friends and worst debtors
within the space of a month?

05:47.628 --> 05:49.108
How could you?!

05:52.308 --> 05:55.508
What I meant earlier was,

05:55.508 --> 05:57.228
it's possible

05:57.228 --> 05:59.228
that you're in the
throes of a depression...

05:59.228 --> 06:01.988
What you said was
dangerously offensive

06:01.988 --> 06:05.388
to a man of my constitution.
Depressed? For fuck's sake?

06:07.028 --> 06:11.868
I think what I meant was,
a depression by proxy.

06:11.868 --> 06:15.148
A pretend depression, if you will.

06:18.028 --> 06:20.628
What kind of stuff's required to
fix this little fucker, then, hey?

06:20.628 --> 06:21.908
Anti-depressants.

06:23.387 --> 06:27.427
But...placebo-esque ones,

06:27.427 --> 06:31.907
for pretend depression, by proxy.

06:33.507 --> 06:35.667
Right you are.

06:37.267 --> 06:38.347
Thank you.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.907
Truth being, Mrs Ahmed,

06:40.907 --> 06:44.827
I heard about your son within a
fortnight of Felix Fawcett's demise.

06:44.827 --> 06:48.707
Bloke Zizzy, Ronnie and I
shared a cell with.

06:50.307 --> 06:53.067
Like Three Musketeers,
we were, the four of us.

06:53.067 --> 06:57.867
Me, Felix, as black as you like,
Ronnie Cohen, the only Jew castigated

06:57.867 --> 07:02.707
for making good money,
and your beautiful Zizzy.

07:02.707 --> 07:07.627
Nights on end, talking about finding
the right girl he would marry.

07:07.627 --> 07:10.587
Ah, all three so alike.

07:10.587 --> 07:13.066
Uncannily alike,
when it came to unpaid debts

07:13.066 --> 07:14.866
and treading on my business toes.

07:14.866 --> 07:18.026
No ill of the dead intended.

07:18.026 --> 07:20.026
First among equals, your Zizzy.

07:20.026 --> 07:24.266
Ergo, drowning with dignity in
the privacy of his own bathroom.

07:24.266 --> 07:26.186
Mmm?

07:29.386 --> 07:32.706
You're joking, aren't you?
You can't seat my dad next to yours.

07:32.706 --> 07:34.746
But we have to
if your mum's not coming.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.866
I'm hoping he's not coming,
not if he brings that nutter.

07:37.866 --> 07:39.586
She looks like Chris Moyles
in a jumpsuit.

07:39.586 --> 07:41.866
It doesn't matter who comes, anyway.

07:41.866 --> 07:44.706
No one's gonna be looking
at anyone but the bride.

07:47.466 --> 07:48.666
Especially me.

07:48.666 --> 07:49.826
< Oi!

07:49.826 --> 07:52.506
You're supposed to
be doing the barrels.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.826
Oh! Where am I sitting, then?

07:56.866 --> 07:58.106
"Am I bovvered"?

07:58.106 --> 08:01.186
Just put my name on your
furniture when you split up.

08:01.186 --> 08:05.305
Only give me long enough to save
a couple of hundred quid.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.665
BANGING ON DOOR

08:17.265 --> 08:20.025
LAUGHTER FROM TV

08:40.225 --> 08:42.664
Sorry!

08:45.985 --> 08:48.105
Not a chance without
the remote, Carl.

08:48.105 --> 08:49.505
You can reach the controls from here.

08:49.505 --> 08:51.505
I watch telly in bed.

08:51.505 --> 08:53.665
Another 20,
and I'll find you a Sky dish,

08:53.665 --> 08:56.024
and I'll get you to stick
to reach the buttons.

09:01.504 --> 09:04.504
Why the hurry?

09:04.504 --> 09:06.024
Please...

09:07.664 --> 09:09.104
All right.

09:14.104 --> 09:17.424
One condition - you make sure
your mam hears about this.

09:17.424 --> 09:20.864
You must tell her
that I gave you double that.

09:21.944 --> 09:26.784
I've stopped her pocket money
cos Worzel kept cadging it off her.

09:26.784 --> 09:31.704
I know he's your dad, but she must
hate herself to let that
bedridden fuck anywhere near her.

09:31.704 --> 09:33.264
Do us a favour in the meantime -

09:33.264 --> 09:36.584
you say it loud and clear -

09:36.584 --> 09:39.984
Norma is doing up this van,
splashing out.

09:39.984 --> 09:42.184
What, this shit hole?

09:42.184 --> 09:45.863
She thinks I've stopped her spends
because I'm skint.

09:45.863 --> 09:49.783
But she needs showing
that what's mine is hers.

09:49.783 --> 09:52.623
But not until she puts
that mongrel to sleep.

09:52.623 --> 09:54.543
Spend it on a flat of your own.

09:54.543 --> 09:57.143
I'm not budging from here
until she leaves with me.

09:57.143 --> 09:59.863
Which might not happen
until I tidy my act up,

09:59.863 --> 10:02.023
give her a reason
to look at me twice.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.383
Sorry, I...

10:06.463 --> 10:08.183
(SOBS) >

10:13.143 --> 10:14.903
Ta. >

10:45.622 --> 10:48.542
Who would you tell first
if you was in the shit?

10:50.982 --> 10:52.102
Deep shit.

10:53.822 --> 10:56.742
Running out of time so
you can't breathe properly?

11:02.222 --> 11:06.342
Not long, you'll all be going, "What
the fuck happened to our Carl?"

11:06.342 --> 11:08.222
"It's quiet without Lip,"

11:08.222 --> 11:12.382
and then, "Anybody seen Carl?

11:12.382 --> 11:14.462
"It's a lot...

11:14.462 --> 11:15.902
"lot quieter."

11:19.302 --> 11:22.982
You can't lend us 500
by Friday, can you? >

11:28.221 --> 11:29.621
(SCREAMS)

11:31.381 --> 11:33.981
What kind of shit did
they mix this stuff with?

11:33.981 --> 11:36.221
Go on, shift, make us a brew.

11:37.181 --> 11:40.861
And stop frowning!

11:45.341 --> 11:48.981
# Ave dominus

11:48.981 --> 11:52.821
# Dominus Tecum

11:54.421 --> 12:02.461
# Benedicta tu in mulieribus

12:02.461 --> 12:09.581
# Et benedictus fructus ventris

12:09.581 --> 12:16.781
# Ventris tuae, Jesus

12:16.781 --> 12:26.620
# Ave Maria. #

12:26.620 --> 12:28.780
APPLAUSE

12:28.780 --> 12:31.380
Ah, if there's no place
in heaven for yous lot,

12:31.380 --> 12:34.140
someone is getting a punch
in the knickers from me,

12:34.140 --> 12:35.700
tell 'em I said so. Whoops!

12:35.700 --> 12:39.220
If you hadn't seen the state of
them, they could have been angels.

12:39.220 --> 12:41.660
That's the first
time my hair's stood on end.

12:41.660 --> 12:42.940
Are you lot sisters?

12:42.940 --> 12:45.380
We're all at Roswell.

12:45.380 --> 12:48.700
Rehabilitation Offenders Showcase,
down Wellington Road.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.740
In that case, you should
be extra proud.

12:50.740 --> 12:56.900
Right, sizes, so the seamstress can
cut the patterns out. Who's first?

12:56.900 --> 12:58.740
Why didn't you tell me
it had switched?

12:58.740 --> 13:00.060
Me mam told...

13:00.060 --> 13:02.060
Remember, outside Boots?

13:02.060 --> 13:04.420
When I went,
"Singers, change of plan.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.860
"Bad news for Angela here, she
has been summoned to crown court."

13:07.860 --> 13:11.979
And you went, "Is Angela
the scraggy, ginger, deaf one?"

13:11.979 --> 13:12.859
Karen, you didn't?

13:12.859 --> 13:14.019
And I said, "Yeah..."

13:14.019 --> 13:15.299
Dickhead. No!

13:15.299 --> 13:19.859
"..but I think she'd prefer
'little red-headed stunner
with a hearing impairment'."

13:19.859 --> 13:22.499
We'd better shoot if you don't
want to miss the start again.

13:22.499 --> 13:25.179
Keys, Mickey. And a lid for Karen.

13:28.859 --> 13:30.659
Watch that throttle for sticking.

13:30.659 --> 13:32.419
And it's running low on juice.

13:33.939 --> 13:37.539
Hey, I'd think twice before
singing at his wedding.

13:37.539 --> 13:38.579
This mug's a probation officer now.

13:38.579 --> 13:39.779
Training to be.

13:39.779 --> 13:42.179
My brother, a probation officer?
That's embarrassing.

13:42.179 --> 13:44.059
Until one of us changes his mind.

14:01.578 --> 14:04.578
Is it all right
paying you next week for this gear?

14:04.578 --> 14:05.338
Mam's cool about it.

14:05.338 --> 14:07.938
Will you stop talking to me
like a total stranger?

14:07.938 --> 14:09.258
Just don't be caught retailing.

14:09.258 --> 14:13.178
You've been doing that for years,
phoned more scags than Longford.

14:13.178 --> 14:16.498
Teaching dozy pricks how not to get
caught is economic imperative.

14:16.498 --> 14:19.818
I can't operate franchises
with the labour force in prison.

14:19.818 --> 14:23.058
No comparison to the scale of
defection you're contemplating.

14:23.058 --> 14:25.018
I need you to know that I love you...

14:27.178 --> 14:29.578
..more than words
could ever describe.

14:32.858 --> 14:34.458
I'm sorry about your mate, Dad.

14:38.618 --> 14:41.458
How humiliating, eh?
Ignore me. Shut the door.

14:45.138 --> 14:46.578
Behind you.

15:07.012 --> 15:09.412
A very warm welcome back
to our third weekend

15:09.412 --> 15:14.372
of your probation induction course
at Anderton Lodge, of all places.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.332
Boom-boom.
We... Oh.

15:18.372 --> 15:20.252
Welcome back.

15:20.252 --> 15:24.652
Particularly, special thanks to you
wives, husbands, joining us now,

15:24.652 --> 15:27.932
for dedicating time and effort,
supporting your partners,

15:27.932 --> 15:30.532
helping them
back into the mainstream,

15:30.532 --> 15:34.012
and more importantly, start
putting something back into society,

15:34.012 --> 15:37.332
using their firsthand,
service user experience

15:37.332 --> 15:42.452
to hopefully, touch wood,
turn one or two skags

15:42.452 --> 15:46.811
from our beloved public housing
sector into responsible citizens

15:46.811 --> 15:48.771
and tax payers.

15:48.771 --> 15:50.891
Swallow that,
you'll swallow anything.

15:50.891 --> 15:52.651
Only messing.

15:52.651 --> 15:54.051
Reputation to uphold...

15:54.051 --> 15:57.291
(I'm telling you, Jamie,
your mam's got a big screw loose.)

15:57.291 --> 15:59.331
I am talking here, Mrs Maguire.

15:59.331 --> 16:01.571
Er, so am I, pal.

16:03.731 --> 16:08.331
# SUGABABES: Push The Button

16:08.331 --> 16:11.491
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

16:17.131 --> 16:18.571
Ian!

16:20.731 --> 16:23.571
Somebody's after a pint of tweezers.

16:23.571 --> 16:25.771
No, it's a pint and two Es.

16:25.771 --> 16:28.811
Two quid each,
Ã‚Â£2.50 after 10 o'clock.

16:30.611 --> 16:35.530
It's me, now that I am
the captain of this little ship

16:35.530 --> 16:38.450
while Jez is away on maternity,
with little baby Jason...

16:38.450 --> 16:40.010
APPLAUSE

16:40.010 --> 16:41.530
Ah!

16:41.530 --> 16:44.570
..who she incubated for profit,

16:44.570 --> 16:47.610
charging that
young couple a fortune.

16:47.610 --> 16:50.610
So, can people please stop
passing cards to the bar staff

16:50.610 --> 16:53.370
for them to send on,
without stamps?

16:55.610 --> 17:00.370
# Sometimes, it's
hard to be a woman... #

17:00.370 --> 17:03.050
Did I tell you,
she had 18 stitches?

17:03.050 --> 17:04.890
(THEY GASP)

17:04.890 --> 17:05.970
Is that all?

17:05.970 --> 17:09.450
# ..all your love
to just one man... #

17:09.450 --> 17:12.810
Oh, God,
shutting the shop down, or what?

17:12.810 --> 17:14.369
Banging it in, shooting off.

17:14.369 --> 17:17.410
Oh! But you came to see
the hypnotist, he'll be on in a sec.

17:17.410 --> 17:20.010
Yeah, he'll cure your headache.

17:20.010 --> 17:23.650
Regressed to a past life,
Jacko with two dicks and one eye.

17:23.650 --> 17:24.729
Ow!

17:24.729 --> 17:28.729
I've just got you a drink in,
don't be a giver-upper.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.649
If you're twisting my arm, like...

17:32.649 --> 17:35.209
# ..Stand by your man

17:35.209 --> 17:39.649
# And tell the world
you love him... #

17:39.649 --> 17:41.489
They'll think you're paying, Norma.

17:44.169 --> 17:45.249
Get the clown on!

17:49.289 --> 17:53.449
# ..Stand by your man! #

17:53.449 --> 17:54.529
FRANK: She's off.

17:54.529 --> 17:59.969
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

18:07.209 --> 18:11.849
What if you wasn't just tarting
the van up to sit here waiting,
but actually making it drivable,

18:11.849 --> 18:16.328
as if any second now,
you'll be setting off somewhere else,
somewhere brilliant.

18:16.328 --> 18:17.728
Like America.

18:21.008 --> 18:22.328
It's not mine to drive off.

18:23.128 --> 18:24.568
Exactly.

18:24.568 --> 18:28.008
But if you give us
a oner for the logbook,

18:28.008 --> 18:30.128
you can say you're
driving through Texas.

18:31.768 --> 18:32.728
< Yours for a oner,

18:32.728 --> 18:34.448
but I'll need the money by Friday.

19:56.127 --> 19:57.207
Get fucked.

19:57.207 --> 19:58.646
Beg pardon.

19:58.646 --> 20:00.166
Didn't mean you.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.206
Mum!

20:03.046 --> 20:06.166
What's Norma doing the
van up for to go to Texas? >

20:06.166 --> 20:10.926
If you're saying stupid stuff cos
you're sleepwalking, I'll have to
fetch someone. It freaks me out.

20:10.926 --> 20:12.646
No, she is.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.926
Texas, with that blonde bird
with the big tits.

20:15.926 --> 20:17.926
See her sneaking
in and out sometimes.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.526
Is she a mate of yours? >

20:21.806 --> 20:22.886
Probably.

20:50.085 --> 20:52.325
Who've you been seeing
at four in the morning?

20:55.165 --> 20:56.205
Finding a petrol station.

20:56.205 --> 20:57.765
We filled up when we set off.

21:03.565 --> 21:05.525
Not with rubbers...

21:07.365 --> 21:09.005
..chocolates,

21:09.005 --> 21:11.245
and most importantly...

21:13.285 --> 21:14.645
..wrapping paper.

21:16.605 --> 21:17.605
What is it?

21:18.685 --> 21:22.405
The whole point of
travelling miles was
to keep you guessing a bit longer.

21:23.725 --> 21:25.045
Go on.

21:46.244 --> 21:48.044
You don't do the rings yet,
you knob.

21:49.724 --> 21:51.204
This one's allowed any time.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.404
< Eternity ring.

21:53.404 --> 21:55.124
Wow!

21:55.124 --> 22:00.044
I've never been known what
they're were meant to be for.
I know what the word means...

22:01.084 --> 22:02.244
You're mad sometimes, you.

22:04.284 --> 22:05.604
This is doing my head in.

22:05.604 --> 22:06.724
Hey...

22:10.124 --> 22:12.844
This is yours.

22:14.044 --> 22:15.044
From me.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.724
For life.

22:20.284 --> 22:21.684
For ever.

22:33.883 --> 22:35.203
Oh, man.

22:46.563 --> 22:48.003
Mum! Do you mind?

22:52.443 --> 22:53.643
^ Do you mind?

22:53.643 --> 22:54.683
Mum!

22:54.683 --> 22:57.203
For fuck's sake, Carl, grow up.

22:57.203 --> 22:58.803
< And put some weight on.

22:59.883 --> 23:01.163
Carl?

23:01.163 --> 23:02.243
What?

23:02.243 --> 23:03.323
Carl!

23:03.323 --> 23:04.723
Carl?

23:04.723 --> 23:06.363
What?

23:06.363 --> 23:08.323
D'ya know what?
You can all get fucked,

23:08.323 --> 23:10.243
eat shit, and die.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.283
Cos I ain't
gonna be here much longer.

23:20.603 --> 23:25.442
Not that I'm bitching about your
estimate, I'm a great believer
in you get what you pay for.

23:25.442 --> 23:28.762
It's just, I would expect it
to be perfect for that price.

23:29.922 --> 23:33.122
Have you seen this? Spending money
like it's fuckin' water.

23:33.122 --> 23:35.362
Is that all you ever
think about, money?

23:37.122 --> 23:39.882
Well, you said she was
totally obsessed with you.

23:39.882 --> 23:41.882
Of course she is,
it's as plain as day.

23:42.962 --> 23:46.242
Right, well, just tell her
that you need more proof,

23:46.242 --> 23:47.802
enough to get us by till Friday.

23:49.042 --> 23:50.482
Go on!

24:01.282 --> 24:04.082
Just get out there
and get some spends.

24:10.042 --> 24:11.762
Where's your lipstick?

24:11.762 --> 24:14.361
Fuckin' turned into super nanny now.

24:14.361 --> 24:17.001
I'm a fan of first impressions.

24:17.001 --> 24:21.361
I'm telling you, Norma. This little
home, I can turn it into a palace.

24:21.361 --> 24:23.401
Knock-knock.

24:23.401 --> 24:26.401
I heard voices, thought I'd check
you weren't being burgled.

24:30.201 --> 24:32.201
We don't stare.

24:35.161 --> 24:37.641
Something I learn to get used to.

24:37.641 --> 24:41.121
After 9/11,
we are all potential terrorists.

24:42.801 --> 24:46.401
Couldn't lend us 30, could you?
Get food for the kiddies?

24:46.401 --> 24:47.401
How many kids?

24:47.401 --> 24:49.601
Six, mostly underweight.

24:51.121 --> 24:53.241
I'd hate to impose.
Say if you're skint.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.640
Top hat and tails? On your way! I'd
look like an overdressed undertaker.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.760
If she's having
a scarlet wedding dress,

25:09.760 --> 25:13.200
you want summat
a bit more cocky than formal.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.320
I had to get wed
in a turquoise twin set.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.560
Top were turquoise,
pants were purple.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.240
I burnt all the photos.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.440
The scarlet thing...

25:22.440 --> 25:24.880
That's just for the bridesmaids.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.680
Bride and maid, you said.

25:27.680 --> 25:30.800
I hope so. The fellow that
got me this is on remand now.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.200
The bride?!

25:32.200 --> 25:33.240
In scarlet?!

25:33.240 --> 25:35.040
Rhyming with fuckin' harlot!

25:35.040 --> 25:36.720
Tell me someone's taking the piss.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.840
I wanna get married in white.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.120
Just white.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.320
It was your idea.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.960
It wasn't me.

25:45.720 --> 25:46.800
When?

25:47.840 --> 25:49.400
I meant, it was his idea.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.400
Me?

25:50.400 --> 25:52.600
I said to you,

25:52.600 --> 25:56.359
how our new Karen's gonna look
fabulous in yards of white organza.

25:56.359 --> 25:58.359
You went quiet on account

25:58.359 --> 26:02.399
of white organza reminding
of you of less happy occasions,

26:02.399 --> 26:06.399
i.e. what your dear mother
insisted on being buried in.

26:08.599 --> 26:09.639
< Yeah?

26:09.639 --> 26:10.599
I told you that.

26:11.639 --> 26:15.199
Et cetera. Unless of course you
never meant a bleeding word of it,

26:15.199 --> 26:17.559
< cos it's truer than he thinks.

26:17.559 --> 26:19.919
Patrick Maguire can't
hold his ale any more.

26:19.919 --> 26:21.879
(ALL LAUGH)

26:25.999 --> 26:26.959
Is that it?

26:31.919 --> 26:34.759
Can this one manage without
the doorbell on the big day?

26:34.759 --> 26:36.999
Or is that gonna
bugger your descants?

26:36.999 --> 26:39.279
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM)

26:42.919 --> 26:44.718
Oh, bugger.

26:46.678 --> 26:48.718
This isn't funny, Jamie.

26:48.718 --> 26:52.798
It's pathetic.
A bunch of blokes, letting
them run rings round you.

26:55.558 --> 26:57.318
It's only a dress. >

27:00.238 --> 27:02.598
She won't let anybody
think for themselves.

27:02.598 --> 27:05.078
Because the family falls
apart when they try to.

27:05.078 --> 27:09.038
She's just a low rate,
loudmouth drug dealer,
in a shitty little dump like this,

27:09.038 --> 27:12.518
charging over the odds, more than
they can afford, ripping them off,

27:12.518 --> 27:15.958
scaring people shitless,
till they hate her fuckin' guts.

27:31.678 --> 27:33.518
What have you forked out for them?

27:33.518 --> 27:35.158
You get what you pay for.

27:36.757 --> 27:38.957
Right, you two, inside for your tea.

27:38.957 --> 27:42.077
Chips again, I'm afraid,
but that's all I can afford.

27:46.277 --> 27:51.197
Just have to hope my lucky number
has come up in the rollover draw.

27:57.357 --> 27:58.837
Where's the chips, then?

27:58.837 --> 28:01.637
Nearly ready, just need peeling.

28:01.637 --> 28:03.277
Carl!

28:10.317 --> 28:11.277
Oi!

28:13.357 --> 28:14.317
Oi!

28:16.317 --> 28:19.437
I know it needs plugging in.
To do what?

28:19.437 --> 28:24.157
I don't know exactly,
but retails at 80, yours for 30,

28:24.157 --> 28:25.557
which is...

28:26.397 --> 28:26.476
< Shit!

28:26.476 --> 28:27.556
Hiya, Yvonne.

28:27.556 --> 28:31.356
Best price for a bottle of bubbly
for a hard-working civil servant. >

28:31.356 --> 28:35.316
If you're not too snobby,
I've got the Bosnian stuff.
Tenner apiece or three for 30.

28:35.316 --> 28:36.996
Wanna get silly and go for three?

28:36.996 --> 28:38.796
< Three please, Yvonne.

28:38.796 --> 28:39.956
Somebody's birthday?

28:39.956 --> 28:41.476
Somebody's death.

28:41.476 --> 28:43.836
Ron Cohen, as seen on TV.

28:44.996 --> 28:46.956
Panorama, World In Action, the lot.

28:46.956 --> 28:50.516
The most hard-faced
landlord to walk this town.
Owns half of Chadwick Green.

28:52.116 --> 28:54.676
Monoxide poisoning from
his own central heating!

28:56.876 --> 28:58.076
Cheers, mate.

29:03.316 --> 29:05.036
Where did you get this?

29:07.956 --> 29:09.116
Shit.

29:10.236 --> 29:11.996
A customer left it.

29:14.716 --> 29:17.915
When I tried pre-ordering,
they said 12-week wait.

29:17.915 --> 29:19.035
How much?

29:19.035 --> 29:20.435
They retail at over 90,

29:20.435 --> 29:23.115
but if you join the Christmas club
with 20 quid up front,

29:23.115 --> 29:25.395
I could let you have it for 75.

29:25.395 --> 29:27.355
Sold.
Bring you a cheque round later?

29:27.355 --> 29:28.235
Brilliant.

29:28.235 --> 29:30.235
See you.

29:34.435 --> 29:35.675
20, we said, isn't it?

29:37.395 --> 29:42.275
RADIO: '..challenged by legal
action on no less than 25 occasions.

29:42.275 --> 29:45.675
'One case was famously scheduled
for a High Court hearing.

29:45.675 --> 29:48.435
'But it never made its day
because the plaintiff...'

29:48.435 --> 29:49.675
Paddy, hey!

29:52.195 --> 29:54.115
What's the matter?

29:54.115 --> 29:55.195
(GASPS)

29:55.195 --> 29:57.435
Come on, Paddy.

30:00.155 --> 30:02.155
I'll go get Mimi.

30:02.155 --> 30:03.355
Mimi? No.

30:10.314 --> 30:11.714
Ron Cohen.

30:11.714 --> 30:14.954
Monoxide poisoning.

30:14.954 --> 30:17.994
There's someone seriously
taking the piss out of me now.

30:17.994 --> 30:20.794
You know what you need?
You need a drink.

30:20.794 --> 30:23.394
Taxi, please, Yvonne.

30:26.194 --> 30:30.834
I think I've got some EasyJet
miniatures in the back somewhere.

30:34.274 --> 30:38.274
Ronnie Cohen, last time I saw him,
bowling alley,

30:38.274 --> 30:40.714
hard core ding-dong,
as only close friends can.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.994
Went too far, I know!

30:42.994 --> 30:47.554
Injuries on that scale
weren't my intention.

30:47.554 --> 30:51.594
We agreed a truce, mutual admirers,
keeping our distance.

30:51.594 --> 30:53.954
Him more than me.
He worshipped me.

30:53.954 --> 30:57.154
Third musketeer, down.

30:58.514 --> 31:00.233
Gone!

31:01.433 --> 31:04.513
Carbon monoxide poisoning!

31:04.513 --> 31:07.313
Zizzy Ahmed, topped himself.

31:07.313 --> 31:10.793
Felix Fawcett, suicide.

31:10.793 --> 31:12.153
I'm really sorry.

31:12.153 --> 31:15.193
How much longer have I got?

31:17.433 --> 31:21.033
I'm the fourth musketeer!

31:27.553 --> 31:30.713
And I don't see Satan
stopping at three.

31:30.713 --> 31:33.273
Do you?

31:35.439 --> 31:39.199
So what I was wondering was,
what somebody with a wonderful

31:39.199 --> 31:43.159
imagination...would think about that?

31:43.159 --> 31:45.279
I'd really want to know how much you

31:45.279 --> 31:48.279
really need to do a parachute jump
before committing here.

31:48.279 --> 31:51.399
This might be the only chance
I ever get when the time

31:51.399 --> 31:53.079
is this right for me.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.599
Can't you nip in
and talk about this?

31:55.599 --> 31:59.278
No, not really. Family and everyone
want everything sorting for them.

31:59.278 --> 32:01.478
Debs, I need a
button for this shirt.

32:01.478 --> 32:04.358
You're the money wizard.
The best, you know you are,

32:04.358 --> 32:05.598
so don't get coy with me, missy.

32:05.598 --> 32:07.758
'I'd want to know exactly
how much...'

32:07.758 --> 32:11.518
Oh, don't be like that.
Don't be such a misery guts.

32:11.518 --> 32:14.358
Let me here your sunny side up voice.

32:14.358 --> 32:15.278
Have you seen my tie, Debs?

32:15.278 --> 32:18.158
Imagine me, though, from 1,000 feet.

32:18.158 --> 32:19.078
Life and limb!

32:19.078 --> 32:20.638
DOORBELL

32:20.638 --> 32:22.998
< Hello, special delivery!

32:22.998 --> 32:27.038
Could land anywhere, on
top of somebody. You, maybe.

32:28.038 --> 32:29.478
(SCREAMING)

32:32.078 --> 32:34.518
That'd stop your whingeing.

32:34.518 --> 32:37.838
I don't know how much longer
I can live without you, Monica.

32:39.838 --> 32:44.278
The thing is, I think it might help
get rid of this gender model...

32:44.278 --> 32:46.198
That's for 2A.
She's round the back.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.038
Can't you just give it to her?

32:48.038 --> 32:49.677
Could turn me round completely.

32:49.677 --> 32:50.837
I'd rather drink urine.

32:50.837 --> 32:52.157
Facing me?

32:52.157 --> 32:56.517
We've got to use our imaginations,
haven't we?

32:56.517 --> 32:59.037
Oh, I want your baps in
me mouth, smothering me.

32:59.037 --> 33:01.597
There's a thought.
Quite a lot of thoughts, actually.

33:01.597 --> 33:06.517
Clouds and steam and ozone.

33:06.517 --> 33:10.277
And landing there, eh?
It's like I'm watching a film here.

33:10.277 --> 33:13.877
You set my heart on fire
when you sit on my face!

33:13.877 --> 33:20.357
Swirling and turning round -
all the way round. Loop the loop,

33:20.357 --> 33:22.837
to where? Hm?

33:22.837 --> 33:24.517
That's the surprise.

33:24.517 --> 33:26.757
A mystery prize for a mystery person.

33:26.757 --> 33:29.757
Say me...
Say my name, Mon! Now, now!

33:29.757 --> 33:33.037
I'll get back to you when the kids
are at school safe and sound,

33:33.037 --> 33:33.677
all right?

33:33.677 --> 33:34.957
No, no, wait, wait!

33:34.957 --> 33:37.037
Post for you.

33:37.037 --> 33:38.157
Leave it on the step!

33:38.157 --> 33:39.157
Needs signing for.

33:39.157 --> 33:42.516
Oh, sign it yourself and fuck off!

33:42.516 --> 33:44.516
Oh, oh!

33:44.516 --> 33:47.196
Ah, uh!

33:53.916 --> 33:55.916
You OK?

33:55.916 --> 33:59.636
Ignore me. I should listen
to what your daddy says.

33:59.636 --> 34:02.236
And learn to put up
with this kind of stuff.

34:02.236 --> 34:04.436
What kind of stuff?

34:04.436 --> 34:07.476
Oh, new Karen treating
me like a piece of shit.

34:07.476 --> 34:10.116
You what?

34:10.116 --> 34:12.116
Forget it.

34:12.116 --> 34:14.076
Let sleeping dogs lie.

34:14.076 --> 34:16.636
Forget nothing.
What's she been saying?

34:18.476 --> 34:19.916
Mum!

34:22.476 --> 34:25.516
She said something like,

34:25.516 --> 34:29.916
she's just a low-rent, loudmouth
drug dealer in a shitty little dump!

34:29.916 --> 34:31.915
Meaning me.

34:45.915 --> 34:47.755
What can I get you, Mandy?

34:47.755 --> 34:48.795
Got a baseball bat?

34:51.275 --> 34:52.715
Has Mandy come in here?

34:52.715 --> 34:55.195
< Get off me.

35:00.595 --> 35:02.155
Oi, oi, oi, come on!

35:03.035 --> 35:03.995
Mandy!

35:06.515 --> 35:08.915
Get off her!

35:08.915 --> 35:10.875
You're not fit to lick my mum's
boots.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.995
Never mind showing her up in public,
you sponging piece of shit!

35:13.995 --> 35:15.755
A Maguire, calling me a sponger!

35:15.755 --> 35:17.915
And you! Letting this scrubber loose!

35:17.915 --> 35:19.595
Hey, Mandy, Mum's big enough
to fight her own battles!

35:19.595 --> 35:21.075
Exactly what I said.

35:21.075 --> 35:23.834
You must have met enough hairy arse
nob-gobblers inside,

35:23.834 --> 35:26.674
why wait 10 years for a woman?
Best you've come up with

35:26.674 --> 35:28.634
is half-tramp, half-trannie!

35:28.634 --> 35:31.114
Hey! Mandy!

35:31.114 --> 35:33.234
Get up!

35:33.234 --> 35:35.914
What's your show and tell for
the last 10 years, Mand?

35:38.754 --> 35:42.034
You're looking a lot like a woman
you swore you'd never be.

35:42.034 --> 35:43.554
We're getting off. Move it.

35:43.554 --> 35:45.874
I'm happy with the changes I've made.

35:45.874 --> 35:48.994
I want a child I'd die for!
A pleasure you'll never see.

35:48.994 --> 35:51.154
Not if you get this mutant pregnant.

35:51.154 --> 35:53.354
12 toes and more faces
than a town hall clock!

35:53.354 --> 35:55.234
You did all that. Got a kid?

35:55.234 --> 35:56.394
Me and Lip did, yeah.

35:56.394 --> 35:58.594
Plus plenty of other stuff once
we get where we're going.

35:58.594 --> 36:00.394
Yeah, right. Your best laid plan.

36:00.394 --> 36:00.954
More than you've achieved,
you fucking...

36:00.954 --> 36:03.234
That's not achievement,
you dumb bitch.

36:03.234 --> 36:06.274
You got tanked, got your keks down,
let this joker slip you one.

36:06.274 --> 36:09.594
Three minutes tops, nine months to
naming it and the next 20 years

36:09.594 --> 36:12.634
convincing yourself that a basic
mistake was part of a plan.

36:12.634 --> 36:14.993
No you don't, Jamie.
Brother or not...

36:14.993 --> 36:17.273
Fucking...!

36:18.753 --> 36:19.833
Ah!

36:19.833 --> 36:22.473
(SCREAMS)

36:25.073 --> 36:27.873
Fuck's sake, Jamie!

36:27.873 --> 36:30.113
How's Lip taking the blame?!

36:31.713 --> 36:35.193
You're not the only Maguire with
qualifications. I got an A, six Bs,

36:35.193 --> 36:37.233
1 C, just for starters.

36:37.233 --> 36:38.073
You know nothing about me!

36:38.073 --> 36:39.753
No!

36:40.913 --> 36:43.273
Bell's gone.

36:43.273 --> 36:47.033
Nip down, will you, and tell Ian
to sling a few pints down here.

36:47.033 --> 36:48.993
Two for yourself!

37:00.393 --> 37:02.153
Here, stick your head back.

37:06.312 --> 37:07.832
Ah!

37:07.832 --> 37:09.592
Don't rub them. Just blink.

37:14.952 --> 37:16.512
Throw that on your lamps.

37:24.832 --> 37:27.432
Oh, it's true though,

37:27.432 --> 37:28.712
your Mandy...

37:30.752 --> 37:32.912
Way sharper than average.

37:36.232 --> 37:39.392
Yeah, well I'm guessing neither
of you got an A in maths.

37:39.392 --> 37:42.992
There's no way you can
afford to live as a family.

37:42.992 --> 37:45.912
Not in Nottingham, or anywhere else.

37:45.912 --> 37:48.512
How much is your
family costing you now?

37:48.512 --> 37:52.752
Every Thursday I shove Mandy
50 quid for hers and Katie's meals.

37:52.752 --> 37:55.591
It's tough sometimes,
but we've stuck to it.

37:55.591 --> 37:57.751
Proved that we can do it,
every penny.

37:57.751 --> 38:01.951
Bam, anything spare, whacked in Post
Office for when Katie's old enough

38:01.951 --> 38:05.631
to blow it on parties
or benders or whatever.

38:05.631 --> 38:08.551
Imagine that, eh? When that happens?

38:10.151 --> 38:11.591
It's gonna freak me out.

38:17.351 --> 38:19.871
Mandy gets subbed
two a week from me dad.

38:22.151 --> 38:23.671
Does she fuck.

38:24.871 --> 38:28.471
Who's told you that? You see,
that's Paddy having you on,

38:28.471 --> 38:30.511
cos I'm covering everything.

38:34.111 --> 38:35.471
200?

38:43.191 --> 38:44.391
Since when?

38:45.751 --> 38:48.270
So what's...?

38:52.790 --> 38:54.190
Where's my 50 going?

38:56.790 --> 38:59.630
Lip's trying to guess
what nappies cost a week.

38:59.630 --> 39:01.470
Average.

39:03.670 --> 39:05.230
What's routine output?

39:05.230 --> 39:06.870
Five, six craps a day,

39:06.870 --> 39:10.230
plus six or seven for just
fluids, seven days a week.

39:10.230 --> 39:14.550
Then food, clothes, rent, utilities.

39:15.990 --> 39:18.150
50 can't cover that lot, surely?

39:35.230 --> 39:36.510
Great start, Mand.

39:37.189 --> 39:39.109
That's how you're meant to go on.

39:41.469 --> 39:43.269
Back in the your cage.

39:43.269 --> 39:44.469
Cunt.

39:47.709 --> 39:50.029
Why is it always me?!

39:52.109 --> 39:54.269
Why is it always me?!

39:56.989 --> 39:58.829
Why is it always me?!

39:58.829 --> 40:01.789
Because it is!

40:05.229 --> 40:07.509
Cut the racket, you dickless fuck.

40:07.509 --> 40:08.589
What's your problem?

40:09.389 --> 40:13.629
Actually, is there such
a thing as a problem?

40:13.629 --> 40:17.389
Hm? If you truly understand the
meaning of the word solution?

40:17.389 --> 40:20.349
Three points for
speeding on Chadwick Green.

40:20.349 --> 40:21.869
Oh! Ha!

40:23.549 --> 40:28.708
And why isn't that funny
in a post-modern thingy, ah?

40:28.708 --> 40:32.228
Coming from the slowest fucking
organism on God's green earth.

40:32.228 --> 40:34.708
You - for speeding?!

40:37.388 --> 40:39.988
I've never even been
to Chadwick Green!

40:39.988 --> 40:41.588
Jamie had it that weekend.

40:43.148 --> 40:44.628
Oi! What?!

40:47.308 --> 40:49.948
Why would Jamie be riding your bike

40:49.948 --> 40:53.788
in Chadwick Green,
when he's in Derbyshire with Karen?

40:54.668 --> 40:56.628
Why did you do this, Mandy?

40:56.628 --> 40:58.108
We needed the help!

40:58.108 --> 41:00.828
But you had me thinking I was
supporting the both of us -

41:00.828 --> 41:04.108
bare-faced fucking lies! Do you even
know what this makes me feel like?

41:04.108 --> 41:05.908
Oh, rejection so far, Mandy.

41:05.908 --> 41:09.508
Not a bit bare-faced?
Weeks of acting depressed.

41:09.508 --> 41:14.228
Me up until 3am writing letters to
the universities, calling them all
twats for letting you down!

41:14.228 --> 41:16.388
We swore! Both swore!

41:16.388 --> 41:18.588
If we were gonna do this, we'd
only do it off our own...

41:18.588 --> 41:21.027
Where's the harm in a sub if it
helps dad feel needed?!

41:21.027 --> 41:22.667
Good for Paddy! That is our backs.

41:22.667 --> 41:24.307
Never mind what that proves!

41:24.307 --> 41:26.507
Lip's not even close to enough!

41:26.507 --> 41:29.747
Believe what you want, prick!
The only thing that proves without

41:29.747 --> 41:33.267
doubt is, the most important thing
Lip needs is what fucking Lip needs!

41:33.267 --> 41:35.507
So see yourself out, prick!

41:53.427 --> 41:55.387
ALARM

42:01.987 --> 42:03.507
Oi!

42:03.507 --> 42:07.347
If you get a number that isn't

42:07.347 --> 42:11.466
the square root of an equational
logarithm, that's a forfeit, yeah?

42:11.466 --> 42:12.826
Yes.

42:12.826 --> 42:15.026
But, if I get a dart in the big
circle, Bunty,

42:15.026 --> 42:16.706
you have to buy me a drink, yeah?

42:16.706 --> 42:18.186
Yes.

42:20.746 --> 42:24.026
Oh! Tough.

42:25.906 --> 42:29.226
Industrial standard umbrellas...

42:29.226 --> 42:32.426
Fixed penalty,
60 quid cos of this muppet!

42:32.426 --> 42:34.946
Will you shut up about
that fucking ticket?!

42:34.946 --> 42:36.266
I've told you it's a technical
error, I'll ring them.

42:36.266 --> 42:39.226
I've tried, 16 times!

42:39.226 --> 42:42.106
So I'll pay the fine.
Can we drop it?

42:42.106 --> 42:43.906
Fine.

42:43.906 --> 42:45.666
But that's me on nine points now!

42:45.666 --> 42:50.826
Another three, bye-bye licence,
then I'm stuffed! No transport!

42:50.826 --> 42:52.866
Yeah, thanks!

42:52.866 --> 42:53.986
Big deal.

42:53.986 --> 42:55.946
I can't manage without me bike.

42:55.946 --> 42:56.906
You don't go anywhere.

42:56.906 --> 42:59.426
What the fuck's wrong
with everyone today?!

42:59.426 --> 43:01.225
What are you having a go at me for?!

43:01.225 --> 43:04.065
Cos you're always whingeing
about not getting laid.

43:05.585 --> 43:07.265
So?

43:07.265 --> 43:10.825
So you're not gonna get any cock
hanging round here, are you?

43:10.825 --> 43:12.585
So? Cos you're not getting mine.

43:12.585 --> 43:13.985
So, who's asking?!

43:13.985 --> 43:16.585
So stop wasting life -
that's pointless enough as it is.

43:16.585 --> 43:18.385
And stop trying to buy me drinks!

43:19.825 --> 43:22.145
Ah, ah!

43:23.305 --> 43:27.025
Oh, come on, Bunty, you're giving
incest a bad name, you dozy bitch.

43:27.025 --> 43:28.945
Grab that first aid box.

43:28.945 --> 43:31.345
But for the grace of God goes
every one of us.

43:31.345 --> 43:33.265
He threw that.

43:33.265 --> 43:35.065
I need an ambulance!
I think I'm gonna faint.

43:35.065 --> 43:36.825
Oh, don't be so gay.

43:39.025 --> 43:41.105
Well, stick a pencil down his gob,

43:41.105 --> 43:43.945
you know,
or a bunch of keys down his keks.

43:53.184 --> 43:55.544
Well, tell him we need
some smelling salts.

43:55.544 --> 43:59.104
Alternatively, tourniquet thingy.

43:59.104 --> 44:01.104
How embarrassing's
that for a Maguire?

44:03.784 --> 44:05.184
Jamie?

44:07.664 --> 44:09.184
Jamie?

44:09.184 --> 44:10.624
Ian!

44:16.464 --> 44:18.304
Does that feel all right?

44:18.304 --> 44:19.744
Lovely.

44:22.584 --> 44:23.984
Paddy, what are you doing?

44:23.984 --> 44:25.344
Karen, d'you know that man?

44:25.344 --> 44:26.944
Paddy, get off!

44:26.944 --> 44:29.104
Paddy, get off!

44:33.224 --> 44:34.384
Out!

44:44.623 --> 44:47.223
Grave error, Karen,
taking me for an imbecile.

44:47.223 --> 44:49.183
What have I said now?

44:49.183 --> 44:51.063
Not enough for my liking.

44:51.063 --> 44:54.023
Weekends away with my son,
where is it you two actually go?

44:54.023 --> 44:55.983
Anderton Lodge weekends.

44:55.983 --> 44:58.063
If you say so.

44:58.063 --> 44:59.903
And who's he talking to there?

44:59.903 --> 45:03.063
Anderton Lodge, it's
Jamie's probation course,

45:03.063 --> 45:06.743
so he deals with probation course
people, community liaison coppers.

45:06.743 --> 45:08.423
You know this, Paddy.

45:09.743 --> 45:10.863
Are you OK?

45:14.823 --> 45:18.223
Paddy, look, you're scaring me.
Ring the lodge and ask the staff,

45:18.223 --> 45:20.103
the police, the probation officers,
ask the police!

45:20.103 --> 45:22.463
I did. Indirectly.

45:22.463 --> 45:23.743
And? They corroborated.

45:23.743 --> 45:25.503
See? So I'm asking her again,

45:25.503 --> 45:27.103
our nearly new Karen,

45:27.103 --> 45:29.903
what does she know about
Ronnie Cohen's death?

45:30.983 --> 45:32.263
Him.

45:34.462 --> 45:36.662
Why the fuck did Jamie
want them all dead?

45:40.502 --> 45:44.502
One says suicide,
the other says accidental death.

45:44.502 --> 45:46.102
I'm aware of that.

45:46.102 --> 45:48.302
But if you know jack shit,

45:48.302 --> 45:50.582
why provide alibis
for all three dates?

45:50.582 --> 45:52.702
Alibis? We just went on a course.

45:54.662 --> 45:59.062
So how the fuck's he near Cohen's
house the night he died?!

45:59.062 --> 46:00.342
He wasn't though.

46:00.342 --> 46:02.502
Except he was.

46:03.782 --> 46:07.902
Jamie was clocked speeding, Chadwick
Green 2am, the night he's supposedly

46:07.902 --> 46:09.902
tucked up in bed with you
in Derbyshire.

46:34.021 --> 46:35.461
You do know.

46:36.621 --> 46:38.061
Nothing.

46:39.701 --> 46:42.861
But you do know that I'm not loopy
thinking what I'm thinking?

46:44.461 --> 46:46.501
Thank you.

46:47.661 --> 46:50.181
# LOUD TRADITIONAL IRISH MUSIC

46:50.181 --> 46:51.301
MUSIC OFF

46:53.341 --> 46:56.981
Actually, do you mind?
Helps me focus.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.501
MUSIC ON

47:10.059 --> 47:12.819
Cohen. I'm Ed Fawcett.

47:14.419 --> 47:16.339
They'd agreed to close you down, Dad.

47:16.639 --> 47:17.919
Come again?

47:17.919 --> 47:21.039
Last October
when Cohen got paroled,

47:21.039 --> 47:23.399
he persuaded them all
to put their heads together.

47:23.399 --> 47:24.439
Regarding me?

47:24.439 --> 47:25.799
To get you.

47:25.799 --> 47:29.119
They were gonna move
in in your patch.

47:29.119 --> 47:31.439
Everybody I've ever shared
a cell with?

47:31.439 --> 47:33.279
Aggressive envy's
a pulse of economics.

47:33.279 --> 47:36.199
Envy's about wanting
what someone else has got.

47:36.199 --> 47:37.919
Jealousy's about
taking it away from them.

47:37.919 --> 47:41.159
Don't Samuel Pepys me,
you US Open University prick.

47:41.159 --> 47:43.679
These specimens were
total lightweights.

47:43.679 --> 47:46.079
Worse than harmless.

47:47.079 --> 47:48.679
Not if they joined forces.

47:48.679 --> 47:52.238
There is no patch.

47:52.238 --> 47:55.118
That's not my business model.

47:55.118 --> 47:57.718
I'm in little patches,
invisible patches,

47:57.718 --> 47:59.798
scattered patches all over the shop.

47:59.798 --> 48:03.238
Precisely engineered to prevent the
Fawcetts, Ahmeds, Cohens getting

48:03.238 --> 48:08.118
the faintest whiff of what makes
Patrick Maguire a man of his time.

48:08.118 --> 48:12.078
These jokers,

48:12.078 --> 48:14.718
they weren't capable
of joining three dots.

48:16.398 --> 48:18.558
You fucking barbarian. >

48:20.278 --> 48:25.318
No, but our Fergal
was joining the dots for them.

48:25.318 --> 48:27.518
Fergal was on Ahmed's pay roll.

48:27.518 --> 48:29.878
So help me.

48:30.798 --> 48:34.198
Denounce your brother again and I'll
kick you up there to make apologies.

48:34.198 --> 48:36.718
I have been since last September.

48:40.238 --> 48:43.117
A villa in our Fergal's name.

48:43.117 --> 48:45.317
They bought him
that as a down payment.

48:59.357 --> 49:02.477
I heard whispers from a new cellmate.

49:02.477 --> 49:05.157
I couldn't get you involved.

49:05.797 --> 49:08.677
You'd have waded in,
whacked the lot of them.

49:08.677 --> 49:11.677
No thought for consequences.

49:11.677 --> 49:13.797
Life for murder.

49:13.797 --> 49:14.957
< And a pleasure.

49:14.957 --> 49:16.957
Not for Mum.

49:16.957 --> 49:18.557
Not for your family.

49:20.797 --> 49:24.877
And especially not for me who
was this close to a release date.

49:24.877 --> 49:27.077
That's why you suddenly
reversed your plea.

49:30.317 --> 49:31.756
After 10 years denying it.

49:34.916 --> 49:37.036
I needed parole
because you needed help.

49:39.676 --> 49:41.796
I've helped.

49:41.796 --> 49:43.796
Was it them fuckers
that worked Fergal?

49:51.036 --> 49:53.756
He was gonna bottle it.

49:53.756 --> 49:56.596
And they couldn't risk him
grassing to you.

49:56.596 --> 49:59.516
Source for that?

49:59.516 --> 50:01.316
Horse's mouth. >

50:02.916 --> 50:04.356
Felix Fawcett,

50:06.796 --> 50:08.716
just before he topped himself.

50:15.116 --> 50:17.476
Good boy.

50:23.755 --> 50:26.275
He didn't!

50:26.275 --> 50:28.795
He's lying again
because he couldn't have.

50:30.675 --> 50:35.755
Anderton Lodge, you never left
my side except for the last time.

50:35.755 --> 50:37.955
I spiked your spliff with PVK.

50:41.755 --> 50:43.035
'We both smoked it.'

50:43.035 --> 50:44.995
'I didn't inhale.'

50:46.835 --> 50:49.475
'That's why I had
massive downers on Mondays.'

50:51.395 --> 50:55.515
'I only did it so you wouldn't know
enough to get into trouble, Karen.'

51:00.435 --> 51:02.235
I'm so sorry.

51:02.235 --> 51:04.315
You're not the only one, Paddy.

51:07.355 --> 51:09.275
So what about your alibi?

51:09.275 --> 51:11.435
Cops at Anderton Lodge.

51:12.435 --> 51:13.714
And me.

51:13.714 --> 51:16.274
What?

51:16.274 --> 51:17.834
Plus me.

51:17.834 --> 51:20.554
Your new Karen

51:20.554 --> 51:22.914
who thought she'd agreed
to be somebody's wife

51:22.914 --> 51:27.954
as opposed to bunging some legal
loophole that says she can't
testify against her husband.

51:27.954 --> 51:30.594
You were only marrying me
for an alibi.

51:30.594 --> 51:32.034
No.

51:34.194 --> 51:36.994
Well, fuck the lot of you.

51:46.394 --> 51:48.474
It's all very well saying don't sell

51:48.474 --> 51:51.714
tobacco to minors but that's
70% of our bleeding regulars.

51:51.714 --> 51:54.554
You watch, they'll stop us
selling lollipops to fat kids next.

51:54.554 --> 51:56.474
All right, that is it. Stop!

51:56.474 --> 51:59.514
Get the police.

52:01.794 --> 52:04.673
I think you'll find
that the bag is mine!

52:04.673 --> 52:07.073
< We need the police for a mugging.

52:07.073 --> 52:09.593
Carl! Shit.

52:11.073 --> 52:13.233
I'm sorry, Yvonne.

52:13.233 --> 52:14.273
I didn't know it were you.

52:14.273 --> 52:16.833
Never mind it's me.

52:16.833 --> 52:17.913
Yvonne.

52:17.913 --> 52:21.313
Hello, yeah, can I have
two balti curries,

52:21.313 --> 52:25.913
please, a lamb pasanda
and some chapattis. What?

52:25.913 --> 52:27.673
Oh, I'm really sorry.

52:27.673 --> 52:30.753
I have you both on speed dial,
I must have pressed wrong number.

52:32.193 --> 52:34.713
Keys in there, get the car.

52:38.193 --> 52:39.673
I needed the money.

52:39.673 --> 52:43.433
If we all needed money that badly,
what kind of world would we live in?

52:43.433 --> 52:45.753
Got a couple of quid for some smack.

52:45.753 --> 52:47.473
Fuck off.

52:48.713 --> 52:50.153
For what?

52:50.753 --> 52:52.713
For what?

52:53.273 --> 52:56.192
I've got a girl pregnant.

52:56.192 --> 52:58.952
Oh! How many times have I...

52:58.952 --> 53:02.192
Are you right in your bleeding head?
What have I always told you

53:02.192 --> 53:03.912
about condoms?

53:03.912 --> 53:07.232
They're not luxuries.
You shouldn't even leave the house

53:07.232 --> 53:11.472
without checking there's one in your
wallet. Haven't I always said that?

53:12.432 --> 53:14.592
I haven't got a wallet.

53:14.592 --> 53:17.152
What's her name?

53:19.072 --> 53:19.632
We need to talk about this one, Carl.

53:19.632 --> 53:22.432
Don't you be twatting him.
I need him alive.

53:22.432 --> 53:25.472
He's gonna be working this off
in shop for a long, long time.

53:25.472 --> 53:27.072
Can you nip home
and tell the kids were I am?

53:27.072 --> 53:28.992
The kids are in the car.

53:28.992 --> 53:29.872
Why, what have you
brought them here for?

53:29.872 --> 53:33.512
Cos, it's not your house anymore.

53:34.112 --> 53:35.232
What?

53:35.232 --> 53:38.792
Crawling with cops. They've sealed
it off. Assets recovery agency.

53:38.792 --> 53:41.072
No-one's allowed in until
they've recovered

53:41.072 --> 53:43.312
< all the money
your husband pilfered.

53:43.312 --> 53:45.072
My husband?!

53:53.471 --> 53:58.111
Get off. I worked for years
for everything in that house.

53:59.791 --> 54:02.111
It's nowhere near fair.

54:03.031 --> 54:04.991
It's nowhere near fair.

54:14.391 --> 54:18.551
Services have arranged emergency
housing for you and the kids.

54:18.551 --> 54:21.831
It's down Parsons Wood.

54:21.831 --> 54:23.871
Half my family still live there.

54:23.871 --> 54:26.431
That's all right then, isn't it?

54:46.990 --> 54:50.150
For what we are about to...

54:51.790 --> 54:54.390
How come you lot never
eat round at yours?

54:54.390 --> 54:56.550
Because he's put
a nail through gas pipe.

55:01.150 --> 55:04.670
For what we are about to... When?

55:04.670 --> 55:06.070
January.

55:09.590 --> 55:12.470
For what we are about...

55:12.470 --> 55:15.030
But you've turned the gas off?

55:15.030 --> 55:16.470
He did.

55:19.830 --> 55:22.190
For what we are about to receive

55:22.190 --> 55:26.270
may the Lord make us truly
thankful... Paddy?

55:26.270 --> 55:27.190
Amen. >

55:27.190 --> 55:29.589
Where've you been?

55:30.349 --> 55:34.429
What's wrong with an April wedding
if we're claiming to be renegades?

55:37.349 --> 55:39.229
We are in April.

55:39.229 --> 55:40.229
So we are.

55:40.229 --> 55:43.469
Are you out your fucking
mind, Paddy?

55:44.469 --> 55:45.949
No...

55:47.469 --> 55:50.789
..Madam, actually not.
I'm definitely not

55:50.789 --> 55:53.789
out of my mind but, Madam,
thank you for the concern.

55:53.789 --> 55:57.029
You'd best tell me
what the fuck's going on here.

55:57.029 --> 55:59.949
I need this wedding signed and sorted

55:59.949 --> 56:03.709
like Saturday or this world of ours

56:03.709 --> 56:06.149
goes tits up forever.

56:09.749 --> 56:12.749
You know we're right to be scared.

56:12.749 --> 56:16.109
Know why? We're not children
any more.

56:21.908 --> 56:23.948
This got left for you.

56:23.948 --> 56:26.148
Watch the step, mind.

56:28.748 --> 56:31.988
How's it going there, the refurb?

56:31.988 --> 56:34.828
They're annoyingly undersurprising.

56:34.828 --> 56:36.508
Come and have a gander.

56:36.508 --> 56:39.028
Or a goose even.

57:12.307 --> 57:13.787
Oh, my God, Cal, what have you done?

57:13.787 --> 57:17.787
I need a tenner for the taxi.
Quick, before it's 11.

57:22.507 --> 57:25.667
What have you done now,
you big daft gormless apoth?

57:30.347 --> 57:33.827
New rule, no stamping up stairs
when I'm working stuff out.

57:35.667 --> 57:36.987
Ta-ra.

57:36.987 --> 57:40.107
Hello.
This is Norma Starky speaking.

57:40.107 --> 57:43.227
I've got one of your people
sprucing up my Norma mobile,

57:43.227 --> 57:47.347
could you just remind me what
that's costing me in total, please?

57:47.347 --> 57:48.827
'Ã‚Â£3,400 plus VAT.'

57:48.827 --> 57:54.427
Thank you. And have you any idea
where I'm finding the money?

57:56.707 --> 57:58.987
Carl, who have you got pregnant?

57:58.987 --> 58:02.346
In his dreams, the gimp.

58:02.626 --> 58:05.706
The day he starts multiplying

58:05.706 --> 58:08.706
we all need to start running
and taking cover.

58:08.706 --> 58:10.746
That so?!

58:10.746 --> 58:11.346
Carl!

58:11.346 --> 58:14.346
So what's the secret
of your success, eh?

58:14.346 --> 58:17.626
Lip Gallagher, loving the sound
of his own smart-arsed voice.

58:17.626 --> 58:21.226
Talking the talk about going
somewhere. And being somebody.

58:21.226 --> 58:24.306
Being what? What?!

58:24.306 --> 58:30.026
When you got Mandy pregnant the only
person you talked about were you.

58:30.026 --> 58:32.986
I'd pay anything not to be like you.

58:32.986 --> 58:36.706
Having to pay for an abortion
so I don't end up like you

58:36.706 --> 58:39.746
because the first time you have
kids, I wanna be the furthest,

58:39.746 --> 58:45.426
the absolute fucking furthest
I could from looking anything

58:45.426 --> 58:48.266
like people like you.

58:58.025 --> 59:00.585
Who is it, Carl?

59:00.585 --> 59:02.945
Carl, who is it?

59:02.945 --> 59:04.745
I can't help you
if I don't know the facts.

59:04.745 --> 59:07.625
Facts are nobody else's business.

59:07.625 --> 59:09.425
Oh, only me.

59:09.425 --> 59:10.345
We're busy.

59:10.345 --> 59:12.505
Debbie, Yvonne's downstairs,
says she wants to see you.

59:14.625 --> 59:16.065
She knows.

59:17.265 --> 59:19.465
For fuck's sake, she knows.

59:19.465 --> 59:21.345
It's Mina!

59:21.345 --> 59:23.065
Carl, swear it's not Mina.

59:23.065 --> 59:25.345
Yvonne's Mina?!

59:29.425 --> 59:31.785
'Hiya, it's Karen, leave a message.'

59:35.825 --> 59:38.505
Maybe she's gone down
to her mother's.

59:38.505 --> 59:40.985
Frank might have an address.

59:47.304 --> 59:50.744
When your dad got paroled
from Wandsworth, I said if it's

59:50.744 --> 59:56.024
taught you nothing else, you know
how to make a decent bed, Mister.

59:56.024 --> 59:58.784
It will sort itself out.

59:58.784 --> 01:00:00.504
We'll find her. >

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.424
Hero.

01:00:31.464 --> 01:00:35.143
Big favour, Debbs.
We need somewhere to live.

01:00:37.863 --> 01:00:40.663
Course. We can make
some room for a few days.

01:00:40.663 --> 01:00:43.703
I don't mean board or lodgings.

01:00:43.703 --> 01:00:47.703
I've been on phone to your Fiona,
I've agreed a price for next door.

01:00:47.703 --> 01:00:51.023
I just need our bedding
and shit till we get sorted.

01:00:51.023 --> 01:00:54.263
Yvonne, you can't live here.

01:00:54.783 --> 01:00:57.023
I can live where I want
if I'm paying in cash, Carl.

01:00:58.223 --> 01:01:00.823
Tell her.

01:01:02.903 --> 01:01:05.623
Mina's pregnant.

01:01:05.623 --> 01:01:07.463
To me.

01:01:09.263 --> 01:01:11.263
In her dreams she's pregnant.

01:01:11.263 --> 01:01:13.783
Like last five lads
she tried this on with.

01:01:13.783 --> 01:01:14.463
Hey?

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:16.743
How much did she ask you for?

01:01:16.743 --> 01:01:18.903
500 by Friday.

01:01:18.903 --> 01:01:22.823
What have I told you?
That is a blackmail.

01:01:22.823 --> 01:01:25.062
So you're not?

01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:30.262
This isn't fair,
you spoil everything.

01:01:30.262 --> 01:01:31.582
What did that doctors say?

01:01:31.582 --> 01:01:33.462
She needs admitting.

01:01:33.462 --> 01:01:35.702
The shrink we paid for.

01:01:35.702 --> 01:01:37.262
Oh, two sessions a week.

01:01:37.262 --> 01:01:39.742
She'll be right as rain in a year!

01:01:49.662 --> 01:01:51.662
I don't think so, pal,

01:01:51.662 --> 01:01:53.782
cos you must have got somewhere
near to think she were.

01:01:53.782 --> 01:01:56.342
Never again.

01:01:56.342 --> 01:01:58.342
Give me your word.

01:01:58.342 --> 01:02:00.102
Right.

01:02:04.782 --> 01:02:06.902
SIREN

01:02:22.861 --> 01:02:24.581
Lip, it's Jamie.

01:02:25.181 --> 01:02:27.661
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened but I need a favour.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.021
Do you know what time it is,
you mad twat?

01:02:29.021 --> 01:02:31.501
I know, mate, I'm sorry but I
need an address for Karen's mum.

01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:33.141
Your dad must know
where she's living.

01:02:33.141 --> 01:02:34.781
I'm not asking him.

01:02:34.781 --> 01:02:37.541
Just tell him I wouldn't be waking
him up if it wasn't an emergency.

01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:38.621
He's not asleep.

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.821
So what's the problem?

01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:42.301
Dad.

01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:45.541
Dad. What?

01:02:45.541 --> 01:02:46.621
It's for you. Yeah.

01:02:46.621 --> 01:02:47.581
The phone for you.

01:02:47.581 --> 01:02:49.741
What now? Fucking hell.

01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:52.941
'I just need an address
or a landline number.'

01:02:52.941 --> 01:02:53.861
For Sheila.

01:02:53.861 --> 01:02:55.741
I'll give you a number.

01:02:55.741 --> 01:02:59.701
And in at number nine this week is
Pick As You Wish.

01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:04.301
With, er, hits bohemian thingy.

01:03:04.301 --> 01:03:09.980
Plus Pan's People showing their
snatch on prime-time television.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.180
'It wrecks yer kecks.'

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:17.100
What's that? Whack!

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:19.460
What's all the noise?

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.260
SIREN

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.980
Sorry, Callum. It's our Mickey's.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:37.740
I've never used one of these before.
You need warning, though.

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:42.060
Some of this is gonna be details
you won't like listening to.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:48.140
It's the only option if it's my last
chance clear my name with you.

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.660
Don't say you weren't warned.

01:04:00.478 --> 01:04:04.158
Forever our child,
forever our keeper.

01:04:04.158 --> 01:04:06.358
God owes you one.

01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:07.798
Night-night.

01:04:17.518 --> 01:04:21.518
And how long can I work there
without applying for a permit
officially?

01:04:21.518 --> 01:04:23.637
Well, for the first three months...

01:04:24.757 --> 01:04:26.997
Sorry, what you doin'?

01:04:29.557 --> 01:04:31.237
You can't go in there!

01:04:31.237 --> 01:04:32.997
Do one!

01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:39.357
If I could just get your credit
card, we'll get on with the booking.

01:04:39.357 --> 01:04:42.037
The fact we haven't hit it off,

01:04:42.037 --> 01:04:44.037
I bet you think I don't like women.

01:04:45.677 --> 01:04:49.157
I'm more used to boys,
easier to please.

01:04:49.157 --> 01:04:51.277
Less imagination.

01:04:54.797 --> 01:04:57.437
A few days round yours,
I felt great.

01:04:57.437 --> 01:05:01.117
Only child,
middle of a massive family.

01:05:02.077 --> 01:05:03.357
Maybe.

01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:09.917
Or twigging 'em further up the
barrel than I ever thought possible.

01:05:11.237 --> 01:05:15.596
You don't need a wedding
to stop me grassing on him.
I honestly couldn't be fucked.

01:05:16.556 --> 01:05:18.316
Life's too short, Mimi.

01:05:18.316 --> 01:05:20.996
And, eh, so are you.

01:05:21.596 --> 01:05:27.396
Height's no advantage
if your brain's anorexic, Tinkerbell.

01:05:39.596 --> 01:05:43.076
'Like the eternity ring, Karen, this
is yours to do with what you want.

01:05:43.076 --> 01:05:48.196
'So long as you know it proves
beyond doubt that I didn't need you
as an alibi.

01:05:48.196 --> 01:05:52.716
'I asked you to marry me
because you're the only woman
I couldn't be without.

01:05:52.716 --> 01:05:54.756
'I murdered all three of them.

01:05:54.756 --> 01:06:00.396
'I'm not proud of that, but they
deserved it and I'll do it again
under the same circumstances...'

01:06:00.396 --> 01:06:04.595
Jesus, Mimi! If this gets out
they'll bang him up for good.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.435
Up the barrel to you.

01:06:11.515 --> 01:06:13.435
Guard it with his life.

01:06:18.355 --> 01:06:20.675
20 million women.

01:06:20.675 --> 01:06:22.875
Name one with vows like yours.

01:06:27.915 --> 01:06:31.475
That's why boys make good company,
Karen.

01:06:31.475 --> 01:06:33.275
Mine anyway.

01:06:40.675 --> 01:06:42.595
It's miles to my school from here.

01:06:42.595 --> 01:06:45.435
Mine's nearer - longer in bed.

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:48.435
I can't afford school fees
and private shrinks.

01:06:48.435 --> 01:06:50.915
I've got you both into Chatsworth
High School.

01:06:50.915 --> 01:06:53.315
Mum! No! You can't!
I'm not going there!

01:06:56.314 --> 01:06:58.634
You were fucked up enough
with one personality!

01:06:58.634 --> 01:07:00.914
I told you!

01:07:06.514 --> 01:07:08.474
50p for a cup of tea, Mister?

01:07:09.074 --> 01:07:12.194
Get back in your car
or you're going home in a coffin.

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:14.634
I heard you got this place.
I brought you this.

01:07:14.634 --> 01:07:18.394
Is that the thing?
Throw families out on the street
and bring 'em a plant?!

01:07:18.394 --> 01:07:19.634
Nobody enjoys repossessing houses.

01:07:19.634 --> 01:07:22.074
Well don't fucking do it then!

01:07:25.234 --> 01:07:26.674
What do you think, Norma?

01:07:26.674 --> 01:07:29.714
For once in me life, I feel like
I got me money's worth!

01:07:30.754 --> 01:07:32.394
Ho-ho-ho!

01:07:32.394 --> 01:07:34.674
OK, make that twice in me life!

01:07:34.674 --> 01:07:38.514
Oh! This is a happenin' thing then,
eh, Chick?

01:07:38.514 --> 01:07:39.994
Eh?

01:07:41.834 --> 01:07:44.474
Eugh! Full-on gays, kissing!

01:07:49.353 --> 01:07:50.753
What's going on?

01:07:50.753 --> 01:07:51.913
We're off!

01:07:53.353 --> 01:07:54.753
You're not going for good?

01:07:54.753 --> 01:07:56.553
It was your idea, buddy boy.

01:07:56.553 --> 01:07:59.353
I said pretend
you're going somewhere.

01:07:59.353 --> 01:08:00.233
How's it going?

01:08:00.233 --> 01:08:03.073
I didn't mean
you should actually go to Texas.

01:08:04.993 --> 01:08:07.193
Fuck's sake, Norma.

01:08:11.113 --> 01:08:12.153
You can't leave!

01:08:12.153 --> 01:08:14.193
Since when did my house become
a refugee camp?

01:08:14.193 --> 01:08:17.153
Since you moved into the pub
and stopped paying us rent.

01:08:17.153 --> 01:08:21.393
And I took over t'mortgage and
if Carol asks very nicely, in Urdu,

01:08:21.393 --> 01:08:24.553
you might get a lift back
to t'pub with these.

01:08:45.511 --> 01:08:48.591
Over-educated pikeys.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:53.671
A working-class variant known to us
as two-faced, jumped-up cunts.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:55.631
No abbreviation available, sorry.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.792
Billions, taxpayers' money,

01:08:57.792 --> 01:09:01.232
persuading scabby little know-alls
they can be anything they want,

01:09:01.232 --> 01:09:05.872
that there's a place for 'em
at the top if they work twice as hard
as a semi-detached.

01:09:05.872 --> 01:09:10.912
Tinkers with nits and social workers
turning into captains of industry,

01:09:10.912 --> 01:09:12.631
Members of Parliament,

01:09:12.631 --> 01:09:17.671
teachers, lawyers, doctors and, you
know, fucking them lot, thingies...

01:09:18.591 --> 01:09:23.192
You know how it's meant
to work - float to the top,
sending privileges downstream to us.

01:09:24.631 --> 01:09:29.751
Well, name one! Second they see past
Stafford, they're laughing at us!

01:09:29.751 --> 01:09:33.031
Treat us like fucking infections! Us!

01:09:33.031 --> 01:09:37.111
The hands that fed 'em,
us, the ones that taught them
everything they know.

01:09:37.111 --> 01:09:40.231
Crossing the eyes, dropping the Es.

01:09:40.231 --> 01:09:41.430
So forth.

01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:42.191
(LAUGHS)

01:09:42.191 --> 01:09:44.711
Eh, Exhibit A.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:50.430
Poor old, fucking whatsit, Eugene!
Double shift every day for ten years

01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:54.751
so their Christabelle could train
as a lawyer. What thanks
did she give him? Er, hello?

01:09:54.751 --> 01:09:59.591
Seven years' sentence for fiddling
with her yonks back - but yonks back!

01:10:00.631 --> 01:10:02.391
Eh - suggestion box.

01:10:02.391 --> 01:10:04.871
Leave the pikeys with us.

01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:09.471
Spend some of the savings on welfare,
hold a few bob back for consequences,

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:13.831
redundancies,
riots, civil disorders, et cetera.

01:10:14.231 --> 01:10:15.791
Job done, tick, over and out.

01:10:17.391 --> 01:10:19.150
What was your question again?

01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:22.350
Shift your seat, please, Frank,
cos these should be in the freezer.

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:24.870
You buyin' us a drink, Bo' Selecta?

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:26.110
Get lost!

01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:29.150
Get fucked them. Shan't.

01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:30.790
Bloody hell. What you got in here?

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:33.350
Just a few bikinis and that.

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:35.230
It's Texas, not Tenerife.

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:39.990
I know, but it's gonna be hot
and I wanna top up my tan.

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:43.750
You like it when I'm all tanned,
don't you? And oily.

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.470
What's this?

01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:47.750
Hang on. Did you manage to...?

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:59.950
How many sides
can a love triangle have?

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:05.390
First you're cold, heartless and
smelly and then suddenly, soppy.

01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:10.069
Gradually building up your strength
to win your girl back... again?

01:11:14.469 --> 01:11:18.429
Lezzers or not, you're
just showing yourselves up.

01:11:18.429 --> 01:11:20.509
Come on! Inside!

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:24.829
Get changed into penis-based clobber

01:11:24.829 --> 01:11:29.109
and we can hie thee off with
shitloads of tweezers, fair lady.

01:11:29.109 --> 01:11:32.909
He's right, Norm - if we set off
now, we'd only hit the traffic.

01:11:32.909 --> 01:11:34.949
Why don't you come to the pub
with us?

01:11:34.949 --> 01:11:36.469
It'll be a laugh!

01:11:36.469 --> 01:11:37.509
HE MAKES CLIP-CLOPPING NOISE

01:11:37.509 --> 01:11:39.909
BOTH LAUGH

01:11:39.909 --> 01:11:42.709
MONICA SHRIEKS

01:11:46.789 --> 01:11:49.149
CHURCH BELL TOLLS

01:12:18.028 --> 01:12:20.548
# We've come so far

01:12:20.548 --> 01:12:23.188
# And we've reached so high

01:12:23.188 --> 01:12:27.988
# And we've looked each day
and night in the eye

01:12:27.988 --> 01:12:30.708
# And we're still so young

01:12:30.708 --> 01:12:35.748
# And we hope for more

01:12:35.748 --> 01:12:37.828
# We've come a long way

01:12:38.628 --> 01:12:42.588
# But we're not too sure
where we've been

01:12:44.588 --> 01:12:46.268
# Doo-doo-doo

01:12:46.548 --> 01:12:48.628
# We've had success
# Doo-doo-doo

01:12:48.628 --> 01:12:51.387
# We've had good times
# Doo-doo-doo

01:12:51.387 --> 01:12:53.707
# But remember this

01:12:54.987 --> 01:13:01.227
# Been on this path of life
for so long

01:13:02.427 --> 01:13:06.707
# Feel I've walked a thousand miles

01:13:07.347 --> 01:13:12.427
# Sometimes strolled hand-in-hand
with love

01:13:12.427 --> 01:13:15.907
# Everybody's been there

01:13:15.907 --> 01:13:22.747
# With danger on my mind,
I would stand on the line of hope

01:13:22.987 --> 01:13:26.387
# And I knew I could make it

01:13:26.387 --> 01:13:33.587
# Once I knew the boundaries,
I looked into the clouds and saw

01:13:33.587 --> 01:13:35.147
# My face in the moonlight

01:13:37.907 --> 01:13:41.627
# Just then I realised
what a fool I could be

01:13:42.426 --> 01:13:48.026
# Just cos I look so high,
I don't have to see me

01:13:48.026 --> 01:13:51.506
# Finding the paradise wasn't easy
but still

01:13:52.586 --> 01:13:57.506
# There's a road going down
the other side of this hill

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:03.386
# Never forget
where you've come here from

01:14:03.386 --> 01:14:08.586
# Never pretend that it's all real

01:14:08.586 --> 01:14:15.306
# Someday soon this will all be
someone else's dream

01:14:16.106 --> 01:14:19.426
# This will be someone else's dream

01:14:19.426 --> 01:14:21.986
# Never

01:14:21.986 --> 01:14:24.746
# Everybody sing, ooh baby!

01:14:24.746 --> 01:14:26.546
# Never

01:14:26.946 --> 01:14:28.186
# No, never

01:14:28.186 --> 01:14:31.706
# Never forget, no, no

01:14:33.026 --> 01:14:35.225
# Come on! Come on!
Everybody, everybody!

01:14:36.465 --> 01:14:38.265
# Everybody, everybody!

01:14:40.505 --> 01:14:43.425
(THEY CHEER)

01:14:44.665 --> 01:14:49.705
# Never forget
where you've come here from

01:14:49.705 --> 01:14:54.825
# Never pretend that it's all real

01:14:54.825 --> 01:15:00.065
# Someday soon, this will all be
someone else's dream

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:05.185
# This will be someone else's dream

01:15:05.185 --> 01:15:07.865
# We've come so far

01:15:07.865 --> 01:15:10.585
# And we've reached so high

01:15:10.585 --> 01:15:15.585
# And we'd looked each day
and night in the eye

01:15:15.585 --> 01:15:18.025
# And we're still so young
# I shagged the bride

01:15:18.025 --> 01:15:22.465
# And we hope for more #
# I shagged the bride #

01:15:22.466 --> 01:15:32.466
