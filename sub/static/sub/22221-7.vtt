WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:06.541
Crichton:
Fields of green grass.

00:06.632 --> 00:10.170
Chiana:
Well, mold is, uh, is green.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.377
Crichton:
Crystal-blue streams.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.553
Chiana:
Ruptured bile ducts...

00:14.640 --> 00:16.471
Actually.

00:16.559 --> 00:21.303
If I had anything at all in my
stomach right now, I'd throw up.

00:22.607 --> 00:24.222
Aeryn:
I've never seen anything
like it.

00:24.317 --> 00:26.774
Moya could fit in its mouth.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.692
Chiana:
It's the remains of a Budong

00:28.779 --> 00:30.735
one of the largest
creatures there is.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.199
For the last month,
you've been telling us

00:32.283 --> 00:36.026
about this fantastic place
where we're going to get fed

00:36.120 --> 00:37.155
and this is it?

00:37.246 --> 00:40.613
A big... rotting Budong?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.573
You mean that thing's edible?

00:42.668 --> 00:46.160
Budong flesh is...
well, it's kind of poisonous.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.870
It's got pustule things
filled with acid mucus.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.332
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.
We got that one.
It ain't edible.

00:51.427 --> 00:53.463
( sneezes )

00:54.597 --> 00:55.803
Aeryn:
what's the matter with you?

00:55.890 --> 00:58.381
I don't know.
Ah... I don't know.

00:58.476 --> 01:00.262
I hope it's not a cold

01:00.353 --> 01:03.186
'cause I'm sure not going to get
any chicken soup on a Budong.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.014
Look, I don't know what
"cheeken zoop" is, okay?

01:06.108 --> 01:08.565
But there's plenty of
other food at the mining camp.

01:08.653 --> 01:10.644
What, people live on the Budong?

01:10.738 --> 01:15.528
Inside, yeah. Mining
for nogelti crystals.

01:15.618 --> 01:18.075
How'd you find out
about this place?

01:18.162 --> 01:21.996
Um, my brother Nerri and I
stayed here for a while.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.243
We had a great time.

01:23.334 --> 01:26.041
Why did you leave, then?

01:26.128 --> 01:28.619
The winds blew in a
different direction.

01:28.714 --> 01:29.624
Really?

01:29.715 --> 01:32.422
How much did you steal?

01:32.510 --> 01:34.216
It was a long time ago.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.715
And they're going to welcome
the prodigal daughter home

01:36.806 --> 01:38.342
with a thanksgiving meal.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.014
Look, we'll work it out
once we're there.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.218
If they've got food let's go.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.597
What is that appalling smell?

01:44.689 --> 01:45.724
( sniffs )

01:45.815 --> 01:47.646
Breakfast.

01:48.359 --> 01:49.144
Dentics.

01:49.235 --> 01:50.850
You can't eat dentics.

01:50.945 --> 01:54.984
Fried dentics. You can eat
anything if it's fried.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.280
lllpass.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.404
Suit yourself, Jenny Craig
but I'm hungry.

02:07.086 --> 02:10.123
Obviously not that hungry.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.750
I say we starburst out of here

02:11.841 --> 02:13.502
and try our luck somewhere
else, Crichton.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.583
Aeryn, we are out of supplies.

02:15.678 --> 02:18.260
We're going to become the
Donner Party of the
uncharted territories

02:18.347 --> 02:19.678
if we don't get some food soon.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.926
Chiana:
Nobody is going to starve.

02:22.018 --> 02:23.383
The colony has food.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.684
Zhaan:
Chiana's right.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.308
We must go to the mining camp.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.185
Of course I'm right.

02:30.276 --> 02:32.232
Aeryn:
No, Zhaan. You obviously
didn't hear.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.563
Chiana's got enemies that
she forgot to tell us about.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.366
Zhaan:
I need food-- now.

02:40.453 --> 02:42.318
Crichton:
Zhaan, what's going on?

02:42.413 --> 02:44.199
Zhaan?

02:44.290 --> 02:48.909
I must have food or I'll die.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.124
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.302
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.472
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:03.559 --> 03:07.097
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.018
Help me.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.390
Listen, please.

03:09.482 --> 03:11.188
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:11.275 --> 03:15.564
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.781
I'm doing everything I can.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.823
I'm just looking
for a way home.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.090
Aeryn:
Why? Crichton, why?

03:42.181 --> 03:44.217
Why do I have to
stay aboard Moya?

03:44.308 --> 03:46.219
Crichton:
Because D'Argo and l
are allergic

03:46.310 --> 03:49.177
to whatever's happening
to Zhaan, and you aren't.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.136
( sneezing )

03:51.232 --> 03:52.688
Are you feeling all right?

03:52.775 --> 03:54.311
You up for this?

03:54.402 --> 03:55.983
I'm not sure what's worse--

03:56.070 --> 03:58.402
the hunger pains or the
frelling allergies.

03:58.489 --> 04:01.276
Rygel:
What the dren are
we waiting for?

04:01.367 --> 04:04.154
Me.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.109
Sha-zam.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.320
D'Argo:
That's nice.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.371
You think this'll catch
Temmon's eye?

04:09.458 --> 04:10.538
Who's Temmon?

04:10.626 --> 04:12.332
Just an old friend.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.830
He'll look after me.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.458
Chiana:
We'll get food, don't worry.

04:16.549 --> 04:18.961
Well, we better or Zhaan dies.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.552
Come on, let's go.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.044
Aeryn:
Oh, that's just great.

04:23.139 --> 04:26.222
| get to stay onboard with
the blooming blue bush

04:26.308 --> 04:30.301
and you get to play with
your favorite little trelk.

04:30.396 --> 04:33.103
We'll be back in a
couple of arns, tops.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.396
( sneezes )

04:54.378 --> 04:57.336
I hope the food tastes better
than this place smells.

04:57.423 --> 04:59.163
What did you expect?
It's a corpse.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.249
Rygel:
It's a filthy gelft sty.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.961
Do you want food... or not?

05:06.265 --> 05:08.301
What about your friend?

05:08.392 --> 05:09.893
Temmon.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.559
Why didn't you tell us
about him before?

05:14.565 --> 05:15.725
Is he edible?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.977
Crichton:
Shut up, Rygel.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.196
You did, didn't you?
You stole from this guy.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.861
How's this going to go down?

05:22.948 --> 05:24.688
When I tell him Nerri's dead

05:24.783 --> 05:26.614
he'll forget all...
all about the money.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.408
You're going to use
your dead brother

05:28.496 --> 05:30.282
to play on his sympathies?

05:30.372 --> 05:33.990
l have a plan.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.076
D'Argo, it's okay.
Chiana has a plan.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.126
(alarm sounding)

05:38.214 --> 05:39.249
Chiana:
An attack.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.127
D'Argo. Crichton. A keedva.

05:58.192 --> 06:03.937
Chiana:
Temmon? Oh, frell.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.898
Rygel:
This is who's going to help us?

06:06.992 --> 06:09.369
Chiana:
Temmon.

06:09.453 --> 06:12.286
Temmon.

06:12.373 --> 06:15.490
It's me. Chiana.

06:15.584 --> 06:19.202
Ch-Chiana.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.754
Don't let me suffer like this.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.466
Get B'Sogg.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.260
Holy...

06:33.769 --> 06:35.805
What the hezmana are you doing?

06:38.524 --> 06:41.641
Once that stuff touches you,
you're dead anyway!

06:41.735 --> 06:43.191
Crichton:
Chiana, what's happening here?

06:43.279 --> 06:45.691
He smack-- ah!

06:45.781 --> 06:49.740
Smack into a pustule.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.692
Keedva must have been after him.

06:51.787 --> 06:55.154
Keedva. What exactly
is a keedva?

06:55.249 --> 06:58.286
Vicious beast that
feeds off the Budong.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.743
Chews up anything that
gets in the way.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.796
B'Sogg:
You did what needed
to be done, Chiana.

07:03.882 --> 07:07.340
As usual, these weaklings
didn't have the guts

07:07.428 --> 07:10.716
to put my brother
out of his misery.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.634
Go home!

07:13.726 --> 07:15.262
All of you.

07:15.352 --> 07:19.641
I'm closing the mine till I
track that keedva and kill it.

07:19.732 --> 07:23.224
But with the mines closed
how are these poor folk

07:23.319 --> 07:26.607
going to earn enough
nogelti for provisions?

07:26.697 --> 07:29.154
How are you going to
anything if you're dead?

07:29.241 --> 07:30.026
Ah.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.277
Now, get out.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.233
I'm gone.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.872
B'sogg:
Never thought I'd see you again.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.371
You got some nerve.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.461
Temmon used to say
you liked my nerve.

07:47.551 --> 07:51.009
That wasn't all I liked.

07:54.892 --> 08:00.137
Too bad you left so suddenly.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.357
Why are you back?

08:02.441 --> 08:04.272
Our ship's out of food.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.193
We're dying of starvation.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.240
I thought you could help us out.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.694
( D'Argo growling )

08:16.789 --> 08:19.075
You want food.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.657
Hand over your weapons.

08:21.752 --> 08:22.741
No.

08:23.754 --> 08:27.212
Then stay hungry.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.387
Here you are, Marshal.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.119
B'sogg:
l'll feed your friends

08:59.206 --> 09:01.538
but not you, Chiana.

09:01.625 --> 09:05.038
You used up my charity.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.085
Go.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.216
Chiana:
Get food for Zhaan.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.119
Altana.

09:38.203 --> 09:41.240
Alive and kickin'.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.492
Come on, girl.
I'll give you a feed.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.172
So, what's Desdi girl
been up to?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.716
A keedva got her
just after you left.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.260
She lost both her arms
and half her face.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.336
Chiana:
True god.

09:58.432 --> 09:59.797
Altana:
Too right.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.304
Tara gave it up. She bugged out.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.009
She got some kids
or something now.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.140
True? What about Jav?

10:06.231 --> 10:10.520
Scored big and... left.
Just like I'm about to.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.273
Hey, girl, you've
been here too long.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.150
You've been waiting your whole
life for that big score.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.071
No good.

10:17.159 --> 10:20.276
No more, girl--
I'm leaving.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.988
Because I did hit it big.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.204
You better shut it

10:32.299 --> 10:34.711
before something
you won't like flies in.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.176
Hey.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.799
You really found something?

10:39.890 --> 10:42.302
Vein of nogelti.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.805
Near the second liver,
just past the ribs.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.808
Set me up for ten lifetimes.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.389
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.645
Be happy for yourself, girl.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.478
I want you to have a share.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.688
You do?

10:57.783 --> 11:00.490
Well, then I,
I can get food for Zhaan.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.657
For all of us.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.111
Just one problem-- B'sogg.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.572
That folly closed the mines.

11:06.667 --> 11:12.287
Bastard's probably down there
right now jumping my claim.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.373
Altana...

11:15.467 --> 11:16.582
Do you think B'sogg...

11:16.677 --> 11:18.508
Think B'sogg could
have killed Temmon?

11:18.595 --> 11:22.008
No more, girl.
They were brothers.

11:24.351 --> 11:29.266
Well, surely we can do something
if not cure it, stabilize it.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.813
lcan...

11:31.900 --> 11:33.686
mix a salve which...

11:33.777 --> 11:35.938
which might slow down
the growth of the buds.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.771
Great, you stay there
and you tell me how to mix it.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.240
Zhaan.

11:42.327 --> 11:46.161
Can you tell me?

11:46.248 --> 11:49.115
Begin with bet-tur and ly-jel.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.791
Right. Which one are they?

11:51.879 --> 11:53.790
The two marked vials.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.299
Is it supposed to do that?

12:03.390 --> 12:06.848
Zhaan?

12:06.935 --> 12:10.974
Zhaan? Can you hear me?

12:11.064 --> 12:13.100
Frelling great.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.317
Pilot:
Officer Sun.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.857
Yes? What is it, Pilot?

12:15.944 --> 12:17.605
Pilot:
The micropollens Zhaan's
producing

12:17.696 --> 12:19.311
are beginning to affect Moya.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.522
She's experiencing a
slight numbing sensation

12:21.617 --> 12:22.902
along her inner hull.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.654
All right, we'll put
the atmosphere scrubbers

12:24.745 --> 12:26.235
to maximum capacity.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.321
Pilot:
Already done.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.952
Well, I don't know what
else to suggest then.

12:37.174 --> 12:40.132
Rygel:
This is your grand
gesture of generosity?

12:40.218 --> 12:43.051
Fungus, mold, lichens...

12:43.138 --> 12:46.551
Ugh!

12:47.809 --> 12:50.642
What's that you're eating?

12:50.729 --> 12:51.593
Meat.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.065
Why didn't I get any meat?

12:54.149 --> 12:57.232
You want meat,
you have to pay for it.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.441
So, if what I've given you
isn't to your liking...

13:05.535 --> 13:07.275
(gasps )
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.828
Crichton:
You can ignore the little green
eating machine.

13:09.915 --> 13:13.499
We appreciate what you've
done for us.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.701
D'Argo:
We need more food.

13:15.796 --> 13:16.956
D'Argo:
We need enough to last us

13:17.047 --> 13:18.662
until we get to the next system.

13:18.757 --> 13:23.626
B'Sogg:
You want more you have to
earn it like everybody else...

13:23.720 --> 13:26.336
Once I reopen the mines.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.716
What do you say we trade?

13:27.808 --> 13:30.220
We got medical
supplies, weapons...

13:30.310 --> 13:32.596
This is not a commerce planet.

13:32.688 --> 13:37.102
You want meat,
nogelti crystals buys food.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.524
Work... gets crystals.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.192
Then, we'll work.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.985
Rygel:
Dominars do not work!

13:43.073 --> 13:46.361
Rygel:
Especially not in some rotting
corpse filled with creatures.

13:46.451 --> 13:50.285
(men shouting )

13:50.372 --> 13:52.738
Rygel:
What are those men doing?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.289
B'Sogg:
Deemo.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.456
Do you play?

13:55.544 --> 13:58.877
( chuckles )
I'm about to.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.546
We're here for Zhaan,
maverick, not games.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.749
I'm here for food.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.210
This is how I'll get it.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.384
l'll introduce you.

14:07.472 --> 14:12.341
Most kind.
( chuckles )

14:12.436 --> 14:15.052
D'Argo:
Maybe we should have fried this.

14:15.147 --> 14:18.765
Well, it ain't lobster but
it'll keep Zhaan alive.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.067
Keep an eye on the children
till I get back.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.654
Aeryn:
Mmm... definitely takes
the edge off.

14:25.741 --> 14:29.859
Man, can it get any worse in
here? I can barely breathe.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.569
Hey, Blue. Delivery.

14:32.664 --> 14:33.870
It's not exactly Domino's,

14:33.957 --> 14:36.164
but it got here in
less than 30 minutes.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.242
John...

14:38.336 --> 14:40.588
Okay.

14:40.672 --> 14:44.836
Here you go.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.837
Come on.

14:46.928 --> 14:50.136
Can't. Gone too far.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.009
Need meat.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.182
No, no, y-you don't want meat.

14:54.269 --> 14:57.432
Meat's bad for you. It's got
cholesterol, hormones...

14:57.522 --> 14:58.853
( chokes )

14:58.940 --> 15:00.805
Animal proteins...

15:00.901 --> 15:02.482
Stop the budding cycle.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.480
Buds evolved...

15:04.571 --> 15:06.186
For protection.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.442
Famine immobilizes us.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.989
Predator attacks.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.159
Buds poisoned animal.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.985
When animal dies,

15:14.081 --> 15:18.996
we eat animal to recover.

15:19.086 --> 15:19.950
I'll get you some meat.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.127
Now.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.132
( Rygel gasps)
You cheated.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.214
Yeah.
( chuckles )

15:33.308 --> 15:34.593
It's part of the game.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.845
You're just a lousy cheater.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.428
I'll have you know I am an
excellent cheater.

15:39.523 --> 15:42.060
I'm just not at my
best right now.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.186
This outrageous hunger
is affecting me.

15:44.277 --> 15:48.145
Let's see some of these nogelti
crystals you claim to have.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.776
We'll settle up when we're done.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.322
You know what I think?

15:51.409 --> 15:55.448
I think you don't have any
crystals-- never did.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.120
Don't be ridiculous.

15:57.207 --> 16:03.294
You lie about having anything
of any value to bet with.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.916
Rygel:
I demand another game

16:05.006 --> 16:06.917
or I'll tear your
frelling eyes out.

16:07.008 --> 16:10.296
You green-assed, stinking,
warty, little bastard!

16:10.387 --> 16:12.753
I'm going to kill you!

16:12.848 --> 16:16.215
( gulps )
That won't get you
your crystals.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.222
You get me my crystals
one way or another.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.938
Yeah, you look good
on that couch.

16:24.025 --> 16:27.688
You always did.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.358
I missed you.

16:38.707 --> 16:41.494
You chose Temmon over me.

16:41.585 --> 16:47.501
Well, maybe I made the
wrong choice.

16:47.591 --> 16:52.381
Temmon's gone now... anyway.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.224
You don't seem too
broken up about it.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.428
Oh, well, neither do you.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.310
Well, we all grieve
in our own way.

17:06.401 --> 17:13.364
Temmon was a
brother... a partner.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.908
I'm going to miss him.

17:16.995 --> 17:22.285
Yeah... Me, too...
but we got to move on.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.330
The miners need to...

17:23.418 --> 17:26.285
D'Argo:
B'Sogg!

17:26.379 --> 17:28.370
Go away.

17:28.465 --> 17:32.128
One of our shipmates
is dying. She must have meat.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.130
You have nothing to
trade for it.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.462
We'll get you whatever you want

17:36.556 --> 17:39.172
but I want that meat now.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.225
There must be
something you want.

17:42.312 --> 17:44.644
Hey...

17:44.731 --> 17:52.149
B'Sogg:
Is that what this is about,
free handouts?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.945
I told you

17:54.032 --> 17:55.317
you want meat

17:55.408 --> 17:56.363
you have to pay for it.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.409
( growling softly)

18:05.752 --> 18:08.118
Maybe you do have
something to trade.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.544
No!

18:09.631 --> 18:12.668
Does he make all of your
decisions for you?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.216
B'Sogg:
That's not the Chiana I knew.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.759
No...

18:16.846 --> 18:19.974
I make my own decisions.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.728
Run away Luxan.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.806
(grunts)

18:28.900 --> 18:31.607
Now, give me what I need!

18:31.695 --> 18:34.482
You've got mivonks, luxan...

18:34.572 --> 18:36.904
But I hid the meat in the mine

18:36.992 --> 18:40.359
and no one knows
the mines like I do.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.068
Kill me

18:42.163 --> 18:44.028
and you'll never find it

18:44.124 --> 18:46.035
and your shipmate dies anyway.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.616
Chiana:
D'Argo...

18:47.711 --> 18:50.123
if he wants a night with me...

18:50.213 --> 18:52.545
I'll give it to him.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.247
One night?

18:54.342 --> 18:55.798
Uh-uh.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.136
I play for keeps.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.802
A life for a life.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.595
I give you meat--

19:01.683 --> 19:03.344
you're mine...

19:03.435 --> 19:06.302
( growls softly )

19:06.396 --> 19:09.354
till I'm done with you.
( chuckles )

19:09.441 --> 19:12.148
Chiana:
What were you thinking,
attacking B'Sogg like that?

19:12.235 --> 19:14.226
What, did you think
he'd just hand over the meat?

19:14.321 --> 19:15.686
It seemed like a better idea

19:15.780 --> 19:18.112
than waiting for you
to frell him into submission.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.188
Yeah, well, if that's
what it takes,

19:19.284 --> 19:20.865
then that's what it takes.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.817
I thought this was supposed
to be about saving Zhaan.

19:22.912 --> 19:26.120
There are other ways to get
the crystals that we need.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.868
I will not allow you
to stay here with him.

19:27.959 --> 19:31.292
-Don't tell me what to do!
-Well, someone has to!

19:31.379 --> 19:32.710
Chiana!

19:35.300 --> 19:36.585
D'Argo...

19:36.676 --> 19:37.586
I had a brother.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.054
He's gone.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.254
I don't need another.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.307
ldon't want to be...
your brother.

19:45.393 --> 19:48.385
Then, what?

19:48.480 --> 19:50.266
(sighs)

19:51.191 --> 19:53.398
I want to help you.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.232
Do you want to help?

20:01.201 --> 20:03.658
My friend, Altana, she's...

20:03.745 --> 20:08.535
She's found this really
big vein of crystals.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.365
She's willing to
share the wealth.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.327
Is it enough to help save Zhaan?

20:13.421 --> 20:15.207
More than enough...

20:15.298 --> 20:19.758
Except they've closed the mine
because of the keedva.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.550
What if I went
down there with her?

20:23.181 --> 20:24.796
Pilot:
Calibration is complete.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.052
Did Zhaan tell you
what intensity to use?

20:27.143 --> 20:29.930
Zhaan's out of it, Pilot.
I'm doing this on my own.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.852
Pilot:
Then how do you know it'll help?

20:31.940 --> 20:34.477
I don't, but she's a plant
and she loves light.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.182
There.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.982
Okay...

20:40.073 --> 20:43.190
(zapping)

20:51.543 --> 20:54.580
What are you reading, Pilot?

20:54.671 --> 20:56.878
Zhaan now seems
to be exuding spores

20:56.965 --> 20:59.126
as a reaction to
the intense light.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.707
Can you do anything about it?

21:00.802 --> 21:04.294
I've minimized Moya's ambient
illumination as a precaution

21:04.389 --> 21:07.256
but the spore levels
are still increasing.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.432
You've only made things worse.

21:09.519 --> 21:13.137
I had to do something and you
didn't give me any suggestions.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.437
Why did you do that?

21:14.524 --> 21:16.310
Aeryn:
What? I was trying
to help, Zhaan.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.312
Zhaan:
Lies. You tried to kill me.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.358
Aeryn:
Don't be stupid.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.562
Brutish Peacekeeper.

21:21.656 --> 21:22.862
(stifling sneeze)

21:22.949 --> 21:25.736
Zhaan:
Can't wait to see me die.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.317
Are you enjoying this?

21:27.412 --> 21:29.277
Not in the least.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.237
( sneezes )

21:33.793 --> 21:35.169
Should be easy.

21:35.253 --> 21:38.245
It's never easy.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.169
Budong.

21:39.257 --> 21:44.217
Chiana:
I'll stay half a cycle, no more.

21:44.304 --> 21:47.137
B'Sogg:
I've given you my terms.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.260
Take them or leave them.

21:50.351 --> 21:53.263
That was the deal, Chiana.

21:53.354 --> 21:56.187
Chiana:
Can't we negotiate?

21:56.274 --> 21:58.105
No.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.321
Frell.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.864
Crichton:
Where's D'Argo?
Did he get some meat?

22:06.951 --> 22:09.158
Yeah, he's working on it
in the mines.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.576
What? In the...

22:12.373 --> 22:15.160
Crichton:
You remember the creature,
don't you?

22:15.251 --> 22:16.366
How long has he been gone?

22:16.461 --> 22:18.668
I don't know-- like,
three arns or so.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.291
He's with Altana.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.757
It should be easy.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.342
It's never easy.

22:23.426 --> 22:24.666
I'm gonna go get him.

22:26.221 --> 22:30.260
Zhaan's spores are spreading
faster than the scrubbers
can remove it.

22:30.350 --> 22:34.184
It's penetrating Moya's neural
conduits and dulling her senses.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.134
How badly?

22:35.230 --> 22:37.266
Already enough to impede
navigation.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.722
Can you compensate?

22:38.816 --> 22:41.102
I'm having difficulty.

22:41.194 --> 22:44.686
My own connection to Moya is
still much less than optimal.

22:44.781 --> 22:49.275
How much damage can
these spores do?

22:49.369 --> 22:53.112
If the levels continue
to increase

22:53.206 --> 22:56.289
Moya could be
permanently blinded.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.412
It's all right. I won't
let that happen, Pilot.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.334
What if Zhaan were to
leave Moya entirely?

23:00.421 --> 23:02.252
If she and l were to leave
in a transport pod

23:02.340 --> 23:04.296
then you could open the
rest of Moya to space

23:04.384 --> 23:05.715
and flush the pollen out.

23:05.802 --> 23:09.169
That would... help Moya...

23:09.264 --> 23:11.471
but what about you?

23:11.558 --> 23:14.891
The spores have begun
to affect you as well.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.809
No, I'll be fine.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.056
We just need to buy some time

23:18.147 --> 23:19.182
until Crichton can return
with some meat.

23:19.274 --> 23:21.060
You prime a transport pod,
all right?

23:21.150 --> 23:22.481
Pilot:
Very well.

23:28.324 --> 23:34.285
(coughing)

23:34.372 --> 23:37.364
Zhaan's gone, Pilot.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.788
D'Argo?

23:50.179 --> 23:52.670
( grunting )
( rhythmic clanking )

23:52.765 --> 23:56.724
Slug monkey.

24:00.315 --> 24:03.773
Rygel, what the hell
are you doing down here?

24:03.860 --> 24:06.727
Get lost, Crichton.
This one's mine.

24:06.821 --> 24:07.731
Crichton:
You seen D'Argo?

24:10.074 --> 24:13.407
That filthy character Vija
threw me down here

24:13.494 --> 24:15.655
just because I lost at deemo.

24:15.747 --> 24:17.612
He cheated.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.743
What? And you didn't?

24:19.834 --> 24:22.746
Of course I cheated.

24:22.837 --> 24:26.625
You cheated and you lost.

24:26.716 --> 24:30.129
D'Argo and Chiana have a line
on some crystals so let's go.

24:30.219 --> 24:33.006
Crichton, I've got
a crystal right here.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.473
Our luck is changing.

24:34.557 --> 24:35.307
Rygel...

24:35.391 --> 24:36.506
( groans )

24:36.601 --> 24:38.592
That's your ear, right?

24:38.686 --> 24:40.267
Okay,

24:40.355 --> 24:42.721
Zhaan is almost out of time

24:42.815 --> 24:44.680
so get your crystal and...

24:44.776 --> 24:45.310
LET'S GO!

24:45.401 --> 24:48.939
Ow!

24:53.451 --> 24:58.161
( high-pitched whine)

25:03.544 --> 25:13.545
(growling)

25:17.350 --> 25:18.465
(squish)

25:22.397 --> 25:24.137
(whispering ):
Rygel?

25:24.232 --> 25:27.520
(growling)

25:27.610 --> 25:30.443
Rygel?

25:30.530 --> 25:34.614
(thud)

25:34.701 --> 25:35.360
Rygel?

25:35.451 --> 25:37.191
( snorting )

25:37.286 --> 25:46.706
(growling)

25:46.796 --> 25:53.668
(roaring)

25:53.761 --> 25:55.217
Sparky!

25:55.304 --> 25:57.215
Sorry, Crichton.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.762
Oh, no, you don't.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.715
You're not ditching me.

26:00.810 --> 26:01.765
Get off!

26:01.853 --> 26:03.184
Let go!

26:03.271 --> 26:06.183
-No way!
-There's no reason for both of
us to die.

26:06.274 --> 26:07.389
I'm a dominar.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.144
You are just you.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.350
Shut your yap

26:11.821 --> 26:13.812
There is no more gas.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.612
Let go or we'll both die.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.315
Screw you.

26:17.410 --> 26:18.650
We're going down!

26:18.745 --> 26:20.781
Rygel!

26:20.872 --> 26:22.737
Let go or we'll die!

26:22.832 --> 26:25.039
For the last time NO!

26:25.126 --> 26:27.117
Let go or I'll bite
your fingers off.

26:27.211 --> 26:28.872
Oh, yeah? Screw you.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.169
(yells)

26:30.256 --> 26:31.211
Rygel!

26:31.299 --> 26:35.008
( high-pitched whine)

26:35.094 --> 26:37.255
Rygel... Rygel...

26:37.346 --> 26:41.510
Rygel, let go! Let me go!

26:43.728 --> 26:45.218
Lucky for you.

26:45.313 --> 26:46.974
Ow!

26:47.064 --> 26:48.395
What was that for?

26:48.483 --> 26:50.269
I ain't your lunch.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.771
The dentics tasted better.
( spitting )

26:52.862 --> 26:58.198
You tasted worse.
( spitting )

26:58.284 --> 27:01.276
Okay, here's the plan.

27:01.370 --> 27:05.989
You're going to go back to the
transport pod and stay there.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.619
What about Vija?

27:07.710 --> 27:09.325
What about keedva?

27:09.420 --> 27:12.207
Oh, good plan.

27:12.298 --> 27:16.541
Now put our asses down.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.237
Aeryn:
Zhaan?

27:35.321 --> 27:36.902
Zhaan?

27:36.989 --> 27:39.446
Why won't you answer me?

27:39.534 --> 27:41.115
Pilot, why can't you locate her?

27:41.202 --> 27:44.490
Pilot:
The spores have clouded
Moya's senses too much.

27:44.580 --> 27:47.117
I can't even track
where you are.

27:47.208 --> 27:50.120
I'm on tier seven, and there's
no sign of Zhaan.

27:50.211 --> 27:52.418
Officer Sun, Moya's worsening.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.166
If we don't find Zhaan soon

27:54.257 --> 27:58.170
we may have to flush the
atmosphere anyway.

27:58.261 --> 28:00.126
Understood.

28:01.931 --> 28:07.597
(cart wheels creaking )

28:07.687 --> 28:11.896
(grunts)

28:16.070 --> 28:17.435
Some water?

28:17.530 --> 28:20.863
Thanks.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.191
Couldn't have done
this without you.

28:23.286 --> 28:25.242
Both our purposes are served:

28:25.329 --> 28:28.162
we save Zhaan, and
you get out of here.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.285
I'm not going to miss the stench

28:30.376 --> 28:34.244
but I'll miss the thrill of it.

28:34.338 --> 28:35.714
D'Argo:
Thrill?

28:35.798 --> 28:40.087
Always living constantly
on your guard--

28:40.177 --> 28:43.135
alive and fighting.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.382
You sound like Chiana.

28:44.473 --> 28:48.933
Ah, that girl,
she's a wild one.

28:49.020 --> 28:53.013
( grunting ):
But she's got a heart of good.

28:53.107 --> 28:56.315
Her loyalties are certainly
flexible, that's for sure.

28:56.402 --> 29:00.111
She'll do whatever it takes
to get meat for your friend.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.449
That's what worries me.

29:02.533 --> 29:06.526
Nah. We always came out on top,
the two of us.

29:06.621 --> 29:11.206
We had our fun even when
she and Temmon were together.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.658
Ah, that fella,
he was good for her

29:13.753 --> 29:15.038
and her brother.

29:15.129 --> 29:20.715
And yet, she repays his
kindness by stealing from him.

29:20.801 --> 29:27.092
That's why it's very difficult
to trust her.

29:27.183 --> 29:29.094
D'Argo...

29:29.185 --> 29:33.053
Are you and Chiana together?

29:33.147 --> 29:34.227
No.

29:34.315 --> 29:40.060
No, or not yet?

29:40.154 --> 29:41.985
That's up to her.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.856
Pilot:
Aeryn, any further
deterioration

29:45.952 --> 29:49.661
and Moya will lose all
ability to navigate.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.362
Then we can't wait any longer.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.949
But unless Zhaan's secured
herself in a transport pod

29:55.044 --> 29:57.535
decompression will kill her.

29:57.630 --> 30:00.838
Is there no other way
to save Moya?

30:00.925 --> 30:02.335
No...

30:02.426 --> 30:05.964
Then seal off Command and do it.

30:10.726 --> 30:14.810
Decompression in five microts.

30:27.702 --> 30:34.949
Oh, Zhaan... forgive us.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.125
Officer Sun.

30:39.213 --> 30:41.078
Spore levels have dropped.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.664
Thank you, Pilot.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.501
Beginning repressurization now.

30:46.595 --> 30:50.713
It'll take over an em.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.014
Altana:
D'Argo!

30:52.101 --> 30:54.513
(yells)

30:54.603 --> 30:57.265
(roaring)

30:57.356 --> 31:01.349
( screaming )

31:09.910 --> 31:11.411
( high-pitched whine)

31:11.495 --> 31:16.956
(roaring)

31:28.512 --> 31:31.970
Chiana:
Crichton!

31:32.058 --> 31:33.093
Crichton:
D'Argo make it back?

31:33.184 --> 31:34.344
Well, didn't you find him?

31:34.435 --> 31:38.678
No, lfound Rygel and
one very big, ugly critter.

31:38.773 --> 31:42.015
They should be back by
now with the crystals.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.730
If we don't get some meat
before the end of it

31:45.821 --> 31:48.233
I'm going to cut my own damn
arm off and feed it to Zhaan.

31:48.324 --> 31:51.111
(alarm blaring)

31:51.202 --> 31:53.284
Creature alarm.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.656
Altana.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.454
What happened?

31:57.541 --> 31:59.042
The mines were closed,

31:59.126 --> 32:02.493
but some of you decided to
ignore that.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.953
Where's D'Argo and Altana?

32:04.048 --> 32:06.209
I found your friends

32:06.300 --> 32:08.131
but got there too late.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.301
What the hell do you mean,
"too late"?

32:10.387 --> 32:12.173
I heard the keedva

32:12.264 --> 32:14.220
and drove it off.

32:14.308 --> 32:16.048
D'Argo:
John... John...

32:16.143 --> 32:17.349
D'Argo!

32:17.436 --> 32:21.475
( D'Argo gags and coughs)

32:21.565 --> 32:23.271
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

32:23.359 --> 32:25.099
I... I tried to get it...

32:25.194 --> 32:26.479
But I couldn't...

32:26.570 --> 32:30.859
I couldn't protect her.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.566
(coughing)

32:42.586 --> 32:46.044
Altana.

32:46.132 --> 32:49.374
Altana?

32:56.517 --> 32:59.054
D'Argo, what happened?

32:59.145 --> 33:00.100
The creature attacked.

33:00.187 --> 33:02.348
I tried to stop it, but...

33:02.439 --> 33:04.691
How bad you hurt?

33:04.775 --> 33:05.981
Nothing broken.

33:06.068 --> 33:07.399
Blood's running clear.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.147
I'll survive.

33:09.238 --> 33:11.354
Your friend's lucky to be alive.

33:11.448 --> 33:12.824
How could this happen?

33:12.908 --> 33:15.069
First Temmon, now Altana.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.367
You know what, boudreau?

33:16.453 --> 33:18.409
For someone who's supposed to
be such a great critter hunter

33:18.497 --> 33:21.660
you ain't doing
that good of a job.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.957
I closed the mines for a reason.

33:24.044 --> 33:29.209
Now stay out and let me
do what I have to do.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.588
Crichton:
All right, Pip...

33:32.678 --> 33:34.543
What's the plan now?

33:34.638 --> 33:36.253
He killed Altana.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.554
He's going to go
steal her crystals.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.506
I'm not going to let him.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.433
You stay here with D'Argo.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.930
Boudreau is mine.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.901
( sneezing )

33:47.985 --> 33:50.852
(coughing)

33:50.946 --> 33:52.561
How much longer, Pilot?

33:52.656 --> 33:57.901
Repressurization will be
complete in 900 microts.

34:02.541 --> 34:06.329
( sneezing )

34:16.597 --> 34:17.677
Zhaan...

34:17.765 --> 34:20.723
You don't understand.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.265
Tried to kill me.

34:22.353 --> 34:23.843
Suffocate me.

34:23.938 --> 34:24.768
Poison salve.

34:24.855 --> 34:26.061
Burn me with light.

34:26.148 --> 34:29.311
Look, I've only been
trying to help you.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.733
No, always hated me.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.356
Came to Delvia.

34:33.447 --> 34:34.983
Imprisoned me.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.611
Zhaan, they were Peacekeepers.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.566
I'm no longer a Peacekeeper.

34:39.662 --> 34:42.654
Always a Peacekeeper.

34:42.748 --> 34:46.366
Barbaric savage!

34:46.460 --> 34:49.293
Afraid to come near me.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.336
Afraid of contamination.

34:51.423 --> 34:52.253
It's not true.

34:52.341 --> 34:54.832
Plotting with Pilot against me.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.588
Plotting my death.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.135
Nobody wanted you dead.

34:58.222 --> 34:59.928
We did whatever
we could to help you

35:00.015 --> 35:02.097
but we ran out of options.

35:02.184 --> 35:05.142
Your spores are harming Moya.

35:05.229 --> 35:06.389
Would never harm Moya.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.643
Zhaan... look at me.

35:09.733 --> 35:12.145
I can barely talk,
I can barely breathe properly.

35:15.656 --> 35:17.817
Moya...

35:17.908 --> 35:19.739
No...

35:19.827 --> 35:21.283
Lies to confuse me.

35:21.370 --> 35:23.361
No, I'm trying to
get through to you

35:23.455 --> 35:27.573
and for the sake of
your goddess, think.

35:29.253 --> 35:32.871
Think... can't think. Hazy...

35:32.965 --> 35:33.954
Hello?

35:34.049 --> 35:35.505
Cut through the haze, Zhaan.

35:35.592 --> 35:36.718
Think.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.508
You're a Delvian
Tenth Level Pa'u.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.847
You trained your mind
to control your thoughts.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.172
Do it now.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.724
(weak gasp )

35:45.811 --> 35:48.678
Can't...

35:48.772 --> 35:52.390
Help me.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.395
All right.

35:59.575 --> 36:02.317
|wi||.

36:07.207 --> 36:08.287
( sniffing )

36:10.252 --> 36:12.959
Get the transport pod primed.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.335
( sniffing )

36:31.607 --> 36:35.270
(door clangs open )

36:44.328 --> 36:45.909
( sniffs )

37:01.595 --> 37:04.928
(purrs)

37:05.015 --> 37:07.802
Nice stash you got here.

37:07.893 --> 37:11.181
And you came down to
steal some of it.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.262
No, fella, you have to earn it.

37:13.357 --> 37:16.565
Like Altana was doing
before the critter got her.

37:16.652 --> 37:17.687
(distant roaring )

37:17.778 --> 37:19.314
Speak of the devil.

37:19.405 --> 37:22.067
What do you say we take this
conversation someplace else?

37:22.157 --> 37:23.863
No.

37:23.951 --> 37:27.409
(shrill whistle)

37:27.496 --> 37:30.078
Well, I've heard that somewhere
before.

37:30.165 --> 37:32.872
(growling)

37:32.960 --> 37:34.075
Not yet.

37:34.169 --> 37:37.878
And I've seen this guy
somewhere before.

37:37.965 --> 37:39.171
Friend of yours?

37:39.258 --> 37:44.924
It's a primitive animal but
intelligent in its own way.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.298
Over the years,

37:46.390 --> 37:50.303
we have developed a mutually
beneficial relationship.

37:50.394 --> 37:54.137
Well, I'm really not interested
in your personal life.

37:54.231 --> 37:58.190
I should warn you
I don't taste too good.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.108
He won't eat you.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.902
He prefers what I give him.

38:02.990 --> 38:06.482
That's how I trained him--
to have his way.

38:06.577 --> 38:07.737
(growling)

38:07.828 --> 38:10.240
Chiana:
Crichton!

38:10.330 --> 38:12.161
Crichton!

38:12.249 --> 38:17.664
B'Sogg:
I'll let you two get to know
each other.

38:17.754 --> 38:18.743
Easy, fella.

38:18.839 --> 38:19.954
Just...

38:20.048 --> 38:22.209
You're just a
big ol' dog, right?

38:22.301 --> 38:23.882
Yeah.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.334
Look what I got.

38:25.429 --> 38:27.135
This is for you.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.304
Oh, yeah, this is good, huh?

38:29.391 --> 38:30.847
You want this, yeah.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.344
Hey, yah!

38:32.436 --> 38:33.471
There you go, have a look.

38:33.562 --> 38:35.177
No, no, it's that way.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.307
That way, that way,
there you go.

38:36.398 --> 38:39.390
Good boy, good boy.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.239
No more Captain Kirk chit-chat.

38:47.326 --> 38:48.987
(howling)

38:49.077 --> 38:52.205
Whoa!

38:52.289 --> 38:56.248
(roaring)

38:59.046 --> 39:01.583
(growling)

39:02.382 --> 39:11.347
(growling)

39:23.362 --> 39:29.198
(roaring)

39:30.410 --> 39:32.537
( snarling )

39:32.621 --> 39:42.622
(shrieking)

39:46.260 --> 39:47.170
Okay...

39:47.261 --> 39:50.469
One... two...

39:56.019 --> 39:57.680
Come on.

39:57.771 --> 40:04.643
(howling)

40:04.736 --> 40:14.577
(gasps and gurgles)

40:18.083 --> 40:19.744
B'Sogg.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.826
Turn around.

40:25.382 --> 40:27.373
Drop it.

40:27.467 --> 40:29.458
Drop it!

40:31.305 --> 40:33.842
Kick it away!

40:36.602 --> 40:38.058
Where's Crichton?

40:38.145 --> 40:39.601
l have no idea.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.224
Don't frell with me.

40:41.315 --> 40:42.600
Believe me.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.181
Oh, believe you.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.140
Well, that's a joke.

40:45.235 --> 40:48.477
Get 'em up!

40:48.572 --> 40:50.563
Chiana...

40:50.657 --> 40:52.864
You're a thief and a trelk

40:52.951 --> 40:55.283
but you're not a killer.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.406
I'm evolving as a...

40:57.497 --> 40:59.988
as an individual.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.119
I know you.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.168
You won't shoot me
in cold blood.

41:05.255 --> 41:07.371
You can't do it.

41:10.135 --> 41:13.878
You're right.

41:13.972 --> 41:17.214
I can't.

41:17.309 --> 41:21.473
( shouting )

41:21.563 --> 41:26.148
( screaming )

41:26.234 --> 41:30.193
( sizzling )

41:30.280 --> 41:38.870
(howling)

41:38.955 --> 41:40.616
You bitch!

41:40.707 --> 41:42.698
What did you do?

41:42.793 --> 41:49.631
(wailing)

41:49.716 --> 41:54.551
Don't leave me here to suffer!

41:59.935 --> 42:02.142
( loud smacking )

42:02.229 --> 42:03.514
-Mmm?
-What?

42:03.605 --> 42:05.266
-Mmm.
-That was your fourth plate.

42:05.357 --> 42:07.268
More.

42:07.901 --> 42:08.811
Mmm-mmm.

42:08.902 --> 42:10.403
-D'Argo?
-Thank you.

42:10.487 --> 42:14.275
Another helping?

42:14.366 --> 42:17.199
Uh... no.

42:20.789 --> 42:23.371
Mmm, that's wonderful.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.743
Yeah.

42:24.835 --> 42:26.496
Carolina-style keedva.

42:26.586 --> 42:30.329
Best barbecue this
side of a Budong.

42:30.424 --> 42:32.961
-Thank you, John,
for everything.
-A pleasure.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.587
Y'all dig in now.

42:39.474 --> 42:43.638
Pilot is very relieved
that you're recovering.

42:43.729 --> 42:48.143
Well, as much as I suffered
your experience was...

42:48.233 --> 42:51.691
was also painful. I only made
it more difficult for you.

42:51.778 --> 42:54.611
You weren't yourself, Zhaan.

42:54.698 --> 42:59.192
No, l was the mindless savage
| accused you of being.

42:59.286 --> 43:01.197
But, uh, it wasn't very pleasant

43:01.288 --> 43:04.200
reverting back to such
a primitive...

43:04.291 --> 43:06.703
vicious state.

43:06.793 --> 43:09.125
I'm sorry for what I said.

43:09.212 --> 43:11.043
Here.

43:11.131 --> 43:12.337
Eat.

43:12.424 --> 43:15.040
Don't talk.

43:29.858 --> 43:32.190
You must be happy
to be out of there.

43:34.404 --> 43:38.192
You can't understand, D'Argo.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.524
Understand what?

43:40.619 --> 43:43.031
Loss?

43:43.121 --> 43:46.659
I understand that.

43:46.750 --> 43:50.368
It's not a big thing.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.502
Chiana...

43:53.590 --> 43:57.128
You don't have to
put on an act for me.

43:57.219 --> 44:00.632
D'Argo, I do what
I do to survive.

44:00.722 --> 44:03.304
Can't you just let it go?

44:03.391 --> 44:06.258
I can only let go
when I feel safe.

44:06.353 --> 44:10.722
You are safe.

44:10.816 --> 44:13.398
Am I?

45:02.325 --> 45:05.158
Whoa.
