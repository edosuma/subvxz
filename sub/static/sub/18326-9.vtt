WEBVTT

00:56.681 --> 00:57.682
[knock on door]

00:58.391 --> 01:00.477
-Ready?
-Sure is.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.395
All right, let's have a look.

01:14.074 --> 01:14.908
Wow.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.244
The team stayed up all night
just to get this ready for you.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.290
-I expected it to be twice the size.
-I know. It's amazing.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.503
Think the world is ready?

01:26.586 --> 01:29.714
They'd better be.
That's the future you've got there.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.305
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.890
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.101
Thomas Edison gave you the light bulb.

01:42.685 --> 01:44.813
Henry Ford gave you the motor car.

01:45.688 --> 01:51.361
But today, April 3, 1973,
will also go down in history

01:51.444 --> 01:52.445
because today,

01:53.113 --> 01:54.280
we present to you

01:54.864 --> 01:59.160
the world's first completely portable
telephone.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.748
[applause]

02:06.501 --> 02:08.086
[line humming]

02:08.169 --> 02:09.504
[static over phone]

02:11.047 --> 02:12.507
[beeps over phone]

02:13.091 --> 02:13.925
Hello?

02:16.344 --> 02:17.178
Hello?

02:17.679 --> 02:19.514
[line ringing]

02:20.014 --> 02:22.058
-[garbled speech over phone]
-Hello. [chuckles]

02:22.142 --> 02:23.768
Yes, it's Martin Cooper speaking.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.104
And this is the world's first call
on a portable telephone.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.939
Actually, that's not true.

02:28.648 --> 02:32.026
Sorry to interrupt, but actually
there was a cell phone call made

02:32.110 --> 02:34.404
from a portable phone many years
before this.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.613
[indistinct chatter]

02:35.697 --> 02:36.865
This guy's full of it.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.200
[garbled speech over phone]

02:39.284 --> 02:41.202
You're coming in clear. I can hear you.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.038
Invest in Apple,
and I don't mean the fruit.

02:45.039 --> 02:48.543
Okay, so,
a dramatic intervention back in time.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.919
What is this?

02:50.003 --> 02:53.089
We're going down a rabbit hole filled
with modern day gadgets

02:53.172 --> 02:56.175
that we're all accustomed to,
but it turns out that these gadgets

02:56.259 --> 02:58.803
might have been invented much earlier.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.015
In this White Rabbit Project,

03:02.098 --> 03:05.727
we're investigating which invention was
the farthest ahead of its time.

03:05.810 --> 03:06.728
It's the future.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.896
In the crosshairs,

03:08.062 --> 03:11.482
a monumental music streaming service,
1906 style.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.901
Do you have any Snoop Dogg?

03:12.984 --> 03:15.236
-Go.
-[Tory] Ingenious in-car navigation.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.697
Okay, map says to turn right.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.948
[horn blares]

03:19.032 --> 03:21.826
[Tory] Could this have been dreamed up
almost a century ago?

03:21.910 --> 03:24.579
The narcissist-stick. Ooh.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.917
As usual, we'll score and rank
six contenders using three criteria.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.629
Let's go over our criteria for scoring
in this one.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.881
[Grant] Years before it was invented.

03:34.964 --> 03:39.135
Resemblance to the modern invention
and degree of ingenuity.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.889
[Kari] So, Tory,
when was the first cell phone call?

03:42.972 --> 03:44.098
Check this out.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.354
Cell phones, the defining tech gadget
of the modern age.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.731
There's about eight billion of them,

03:51.814 --> 03:54.317
more than one phone per person on earth.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.071
And on average,
we spend four years talking, texting

03:58.154 --> 03:59.906
and generally messing around on them.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.284
So, it's hard to even imagine

04:03.368 --> 04:06.287
what the world was like
before Martin Cooper's famous call.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.374
I hear you clear as a bell.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.796
But look at this thing. It is a beast.
It's over a foot long,

04:14.879 --> 04:17.548
it weighs almost two pounds,
and you had to charge it

04:17.632 --> 04:20.802
for ten hours just to get
a 30-minute conversation.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.555
It retailed for $3,995,

04:24.639 --> 04:28.434
which at the time would have been
a quarter of your average annual income.

04:30.687 --> 04:34.941
That's why when the first cell phones hit
the streets of America in 1983,

04:35.024 --> 04:38.361
they were firmly in the grip
of society's high-fliers.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.405
[man] With the DynaTAC system,

04:41.572 --> 04:43.658
even rush hours are office hours.

04:44.659 --> 04:45.952
[Tory] And as dumb as they looked,

04:46.035 --> 04:49.205
those bricks were officially
the world's first portable telephone.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.001
Why the interruption
at the press conference?

04:53.084 --> 04:55.169
I'll tell you why.
I found a piece of footage

04:55.253 --> 04:58.798
that might have Cooper's phone call beat
by over half a century.

05:01.718 --> 05:06.306
This film was just rediscovered
by the British Pathé film archives.

05:06.806 --> 05:12.937
This was shot in 1922 in New York City.
They call it a wireless phone.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.525
Now, the way it works is you wrap a wire
around a fire hydrant,

05:17.608 --> 05:19.110
and that acts as the ground.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.239
Then you open up an umbrella
that also has a wire in it,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.325
and that's acting as the antenna.
That I understand.

05:25.908 --> 05:29.203
Modern-day cell phones have antennas, too,
you just can't see them.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.165
All right. She's making a call
and connected with an operator.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.127
There's some hold music.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.546
[soft music playing]

05:38.629 --> 05:39.464
[garbled speech]

05:39.547 --> 05:42.592
The operator seems to have put her through
and she's having a conversation.

05:44.302 --> 05:47.805
It does appear to be
an early phone call made from the street.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.640
But then I took a closer look.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.770
Do you see that?
I don't think that's a phone switchboard.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.105
I think that's a radio transmitter.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.900
Which means that's not hold music.

05:59.901 --> 06:03.071
And she's just chatting to her friend
on the street as she listens.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.783
I don't think that's a phone at all.
I think it's actually a radio.

06:06.866 --> 06:07.784
[horn blares]

06:07.867 --> 06:09.118
[Tory] Oh, crap.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.499
Oh. Excuse me.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.793
[chuckles]

06:16.876 --> 06:20.213
Turns out, it wasn't a cell phone.
It was actually a radio. [chuckles]

06:20.797 --> 06:21.631
I'm so sorry.

06:22.673 --> 06:23.549
[people chattering]

06:23.633 --> 06:25.843
I might have been wrong,
but your phone looks ridiculous.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.846
[laughs] Whoops. Sorry about that.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.516
-[laughs]
-[Tory] Went down the wrong rabbit hole.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.102
This looked like it was gonna be
a strong contender.

06:34.185 --> 06:37.563
They called it a phone,
it looked like it operated like a phone.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.732
But since it was a radio, it'll score low

06:39.816 --> 06:43.152
for resemblance to modern invention
and ingenuity.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.656
You won't let me claim
that it was ahead of its time.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.575
[Kari] They did use
the words "wireless phone"

06:49.659 --> 06:51.160
in the film to describe the invention.

06:51.244 --> 06:56.082
So, we could give you a little leeway here
and say it's 51 years ahead of its time.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.125
[Tory laughs]

06:57.208 --> 06:58.459
-That's generous.
-[Kari] I know.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.628
-[Kari laughs]
-Nowhere to go but up.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.841
Or, alternatively, around in circles.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.553
The Internet and social media are rife
with animated GIFs.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.597
Short video clips
looped over and over again.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.182
They're incredibly easy to make.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.144
For example, I made this this morning.

07:19.856 --> 07:20.857
And this one.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.155
The question is, when did the GIF begin?

07:27.738 --> 07:30.074
CompuServe created the first one in 1987,

07:30.158 --> 07:32.952
a jet with endlessly scrolling clouds.

07:33.035 --> 07:37.415
Underwhelming now, but the 1987 me
could watch that all day long.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.127
And that kick-started a GIF tsunami,

07:41.210 --> 07:45.381
peaking with the iconic dancing baby
in 1996.

07:47.216 --> 07:50.178
Like I said, it was the Dark Ages.

07:50.261 --> 07:55.391
But you know what? Even though these are
absolutely ancient by Internet standards,

07:55.475 --> 07:57.518
they are not the first GIFs.

07:58.519 --> 08:02.440
It all started in 1879 with this guy,
Eadweard Muybridge,

08:02.523 --> 08:04.108
and an unusual challenge.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.153
Muybridge set out to settle a bet

08:07.236 --> 08:11.449
about whether a galloping horse ever has
all four feet off the ground.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.868
The human eye couldn't tell.

08:13.951 --> 08:17.747
Muybridge thought the newfangled invention
of photography could.

08:19.665 --> 08:24.003
So, along the edge of a racetrack,
he set out 12 glass-plate cameras

08:24.086 --> 08:27.924
whose shutters were triggered
by tripwires as the horse ran past.

08:29.425 --> 08:33.012
It showed that
galloping horses do indeed get airborne.

08:33.763 --> 08:37.308
But Muybridge was about to make
an even bigger breakthrough.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.685
He then painted silhouettes of the images

08:39.769 --> 08:40.937
onto a wheel.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.565
This wheel,
which he called a zoopraxiscope.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.366
This was the first device
to project stills in quick succession,

08:53.449 --> 08:56.619
creating the first movie,
basically, a looping GIF.

08:59.956 --> 09:04.126
And he didn't stop there.
He wanted to make loads of classic GIFs.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.128
Look at this, the falling man.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.298
If this is not a template
for the modern GIF,

09:09.382 --> 09:10.591
I don't know what is.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.343
And these.

09:12.635 --> 09:17.306
Again, classic GIFs. Repeatable loops
making seamless little movies.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.061
I mean, look at all these.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.357
That's GIF 101 right there.

09:27.692 --> 09:31.320
And that, my friends,
has gotta be a table-topping score.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.116
Criteria one,
a massive 108 years ahead of its time.

09:35.616 --> 09:39.036
Resemblance to the modern invention?
Nearly flawless.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.621
And ingenuity?

09:40.705 --> 09:44.333
Taking a new technology
and repurposing it? Eight out of 10,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.002
and that's selling it short.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.301
Okay, so, check this out.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.388
The 1990 edition of the Mazda Eunos Cosmo

09:57.471 --> 10:01.392
looked like just about any other car,
but it was the beginning of a new era.

10:01.475 --> 10:05.146
[announcer speaking Japanese]
Car Communication System.

10:05.229 --> 10:10.985
It contained the world's first
onboard hands-free navigation system.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.903
[announcer speaking Japanese]

10:12.987 --> 10:14.780
But long before 1990,

10:14.864 --> 10:18.618
people were looking at ways to track your
position while traveling in a vehicle.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.330
I dug around
and found a couple of early contenders.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.458
This is the wristlet.
It's some kind of scrolling map,

10:25.541 --> 10:27.001
which is pretty cool.

10:27.084 --> 10:32.965
And there's this, an odometer-like disc,
which is all fairly promising.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.677
And then I find this
from the Milan Trade Fair.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.054
1932.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.141
The Iter Auto. It looks like a GPS.
It's fitted to the dashboard.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.603
It gives you information
about things like crossroads,

10:45.686 --> 10:47.146
bridges, level crossing.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.982
So, I'm trying to figure out
how this thing works,

10:50.066 --> 10:53.319
and when I blow up this photo,
I can see there's a cable trailing

10:53.402 --> 10:55.863
into the footwell of the passenger side.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.824
That cable must be linked
to the front right wheel.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.662
So, every revolution
of the wheel would scroll the map forward,

11:02.745 --> 11:06.123
keeping it exactly in sync
with where you are in the real world.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.750
But could it really have worked?

11:08.250 --> 11:12.004
There's only one real way to find out.
I gotta build this sucker and test it.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.174
So, we have little drive shafts.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.968
I'm enlisting some help
from builder Jon Marcu.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.555
We have to create a device
that basically scrolls paper

11:21.639 --> 11:24.100
from one side to the other,
which is the map

11:24.183 --> 11:27.478
and it has to correlate
with the speed of the car,

11:27.561 --> 11:29.855
so that the map moves as the car moves.

11:29.939 --> 11:33.359
We're gonna have to slow down
the rotations.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.987
There's gotta be something
inside the speedometer that adjusts

11:37.071 --> 11:38.906
according to how fast the car is going.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.574
[Kari] We're gonna have to get creative.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.327
We're working
with black-and-white pictures.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.704
-Sounds good.
-[Kari laughs]

11:48.707 --> 11:49.667
[Kari] First challenge:

11:49.750 --> 11:52.336
The shafts and feeding mechanism
for the scrolls.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.215
Screw these up,
and we'll be in paper jam hell.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.760
All right. Now to put all the stuff in it.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.053
[laughs]

12:03.347 --> 12:06.183
Challenge two: Hook up a tiny gearbox.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.521
It's gonna slow down the revolutions
of the paper feed

12:10.604 --> 12:14.859
so that I can actually see the map
coming by. Otherwise it would just:

12:14.942 --> 12:15.776
[swishing sound]

12:17.361 --> 12:20.448
Last time someone tried to find their way
using this system,

12:20.531 --> 12:22.032
FDR was president,

12:22.241 --> 12:24.243
and King Kong was a new release.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.662
-Well, it looks cool.
-Yeah.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.999
[Kari] So, before we hit the road,
we're doing a shop test

12:30.082 --> 12:33.419
by connecting a motorized wheel
to our in-car navigation system.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.547
The moment of truth.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.716
[motor whirring]

12:44.430 --> 12:45.473
Yeah.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.057
That works.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.852
The wheel and map are synchronized.

12:49.935 --> 12:53.606
Meaning even when driving fast,
the map should move slowly enough to read.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.576
So, this is a 1933 Packard Eight Touring.

13:06.076 --> 13:09.747
Now, this is the kind of car that people
would take on cross-country road trips

13:09.830 --> 13:13.626
so it seemed the perfect car to try out
my new scrolling navigation system.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.212
We've made up some maps,

13:16.295 --> 13:19.632
complete with turn instructions
that will synchronize to our test journey.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.136
Winding back the clock more than 80 years,

13:24.220 --> 13:26.514
we head off into the unknown.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.766
Let's see if it gets me
where I need to go.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.476
All right.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.103
The mechanics are working.

13:33.604 --> 13:36.649
My map is scrolling.
It's going the right rate.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.193
I'm going down South Broadway.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.991
The scrolls are supposed to direct me
to a grocery store a couple miles away.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.579
Looks like it's about to tell me
to take a direction.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.082
If I turn here,

13:53.165 --> 13:54.500
I should be on West Olympic.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.255
So far, so good.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.341
Okay. Awesome, I'm on West Olympic.

14:03.300 --> 14:07.680
But that's as far as I get before I find
the inherent flaw in the system.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.848
Oh, really? Come on.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.433
The map has run out.

14:12.059 --> 14:16.021
So, I have to pull over,
remove it and insert map two.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.405
[horn honks]

14:27.700 --> 14:31.203
Okay, scroll's in place.
That is highly inefficient.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.121
[horn honks]

14:33.873 --> 14:35.082
-[horn honks]
-Ooh. Sorry.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.420
I'm starting to think this is why
I could only find a couple references

14:39.503 --> 14:40.546
to the Iter Auto.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.173
My map's out again.

14:44.174 --> 14:47.303
I reckon it went out of business.
It's not practical at all.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.807
So, in my quest
for the first in-car navigation device,

14:51.891 --> 14:54.101
it's back to the drawing board.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.561
There has gotta be a better way.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.233
[Tory]
With Kari's nav system recalculating,

15:01.317 --> 15:03.193
I've got a pint-sized creation

15:03.277 --> 15:05.696
that could turn out to be
the heavyweight contender.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.619
It's a gizmo that most
of us now take for granted,

15:11.911 --> 15:14.246
the portable, personal music device.

15:14.705 --> 15:18.375
Before there was music on your phone,
there was the iPod.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.338
Before that, Gen X had the Discman.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.424
And the daddy of both was the Walkman,

15:25.507 --> 15:30.304
the 14-ounce blue-and-silver miracle
that kick-started a revolution.

15:31.555 --> 15:35.935
Or did it? Was the Walkman
really the pioneer that we think it was?

15:36.018 --> 15:38.228
Or was there an even earlier version?

15:39.229 --> 15:41.857
Now, this wasn't as slick as an iPod,

15:41.941 --> 15:44.234
but it was music on the go.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.906
Way back in 1931 in trend-setting Paris.
That's pretty cool.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.783
And here's one from 1949.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.785
The Man From Mars Hat,

15:52.868 --> 15:56.038
and it would have sold for $78
in today's market value.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.624
The trouble was, they were radios

15:58.707 --> 16:01.251
so you could never play your own music
on them.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.586
But they got me thinking.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.255
So, I started digging around,
and I found this photo.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.927
A miniature phonograph built
into the case of a pocket watch.

16:10.427 --> 16:14.848
When wound, a small spring mechanism
turns the tiny record.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.934
I've looked all over the place.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.687
I have not been able to track down one
of these devices.

16:19.770 --> 16:23.649
So, what I'm gonna have to do is build one
to see whether or not these ads were true.

16:25.442 --> 16:29.947
To pull this together, I'll need to find
or build three basic components.

16:30.948 --> 16:35.202
First is a drive gear mechanism
with a speed governor to spin the record.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.707
Next is the reproducer,
a stylus and diaphragm

16:39.790 --> 16:43.836
which converts the vibrations
from the record into sound waves.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.798
Then, we'll need a horn
to amplify the sound.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.095
Now, the challenge is
I have to make it tiny enough

16:53.178 --> 16:56.807
so that it fits in the palm of my hand.
Remember, this thing had to be portable.

16:57.516 --> 17:01.437
To help me achieve this record attempt,
I found some groovy guys.

17:01.687 --> 17:05.733
Kris Dorr and Mike Dixon are specialists
in vintage vinyl recording.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.444
-[sound plays over toy]
-[Tory] All right.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.614
And to avoid building from scratch,
I'm getting my hack on with Kris.

17:13.365 --> 17:17.453
One idea I had was using parts
of a rotary-dial phone.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.121
As you dial forward,

17:19.204 --> 17:21.248
then when you let go,
it slowly moves back.

17:21.331 --> 17:24.835
That's done with a governor. We can tear
one of those apart and see inside.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.381
[Tory] It turns out the dial mechanism

17:29.465 --> 17:32.760
of an old rotary phone is gonna be
a perfect starting point

17:32.843 --> 17:34.094
for our mini phonograph.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.013
It's got a driveshaft, the clockwork...

17:36.597 --> 17:37.890
It even has a governor.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.934
So, it basically has the components
we need to move forward.

17:41.018 --> 17:41.977
[phone rings]

17:43.562 --> 17:46.023
Hello. It's the future.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.275
It's saying use semi-conductors.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.613
And there's no need for a big spend
on the turntable.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.367
-The record will sit on top of here.
-The record will sit right on there.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.037
-That's great. And it's a washer.
-Yeah. It's a washer.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.123
It happened to be the right size.
We're gonna run with that.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.166
[makes scratching sound]

18:04.750 --> 18:06.919
Now we're moving on to the reproducer.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.088
And you have one
from an actual phonograph?

18:09.171 --> 18:13.509
Yeah, so this is your regular,
old-time acoustical phono reproducer,

18:13.592 --> 18:16.678
and it has a plastic diaphragm in it.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.181
So, now, we just need to re-create that...

18:19.264 --> 18:20.599
-on a very tiny scale.
-Yeah.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.059
So, one idea I had

18:22.142 --> 18:24.812
was I found these old connectors
I had at the house,

18:24.895 --> 18:27.189
-and we're gonna use that.
-Just put a membrane...

18:27.773 --> 18:28.774
-across that?
-Exactly.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.361
[Tory] We're gonna take some x-ray,

18:32.444 --> 18:33.529
cut a disc out of it,

18:33.612 --> 18:36.073
and sandwich it in between the two.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.200
And that is going to give us
our diaphragm.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.746
-That's awesome. It's like a little drum.
-Yeah, exactly.

18:42.830 --> 18:46.583
[Tory] To link the diaphragm
to the stylus, we're using piano wire.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.751
I'll see what that does.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.257
You think Steve Jobs was going
through this when he was making the iPod?

18:53.340 --> 18:54.716
Yeah, I believe so.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.302
If you look inside,
it's piano wire and duct tape.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.470
That's what I thought.

18:59.847 --> 19:03.517
So, this... is our needle
attached to our armature.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.394
Then that is connected to our diaphragm.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.230
So, all we need to do is put
the record down here,

19:08.313 --> 19:10.190
and the needle will start playing

19:10.274 --> 19:11.900
-whatever we have on our record.
-Yeah.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.529
[Tory] There it is,

19:15.612 --> 19:18.323
our miniature gramophone,
matching the original.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.160
Now,
we need a record the size of a poker chip.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.870
For that, meet Mike,

19:22.953 --> 19:24.746
who, I'm told, loves a challenge.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.875
[Mike] I use a lot of strange materials

19:27.958 --> 19:31.128
like CDs, laser discs, x-rays.

19:31.211 --> 19:34.089
-Even made one out of chocolate once.
-Now, how...

19:34.173 --> 19:38.177
-Wait... how does chocolate stand up?
-It doesn't sound great,

19:38.260 --> 19:39.219
-but it tastes delicious.
-[laughs]

19:41.597 --> 19:44.141
[Tory] Making a record is like
the opposite of playing one.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.019
The sound runs through an amp.

19:47.603 --> 19:51.356
Then the vibrations are sent through
to the tip of a cutting stylus.

19:52.107 --> 19:55.319
And if you've ever wondered
why they call it "cutting"...

19:55.402 --> 19:57.613
[upbeat music plays]

19:57.696 --> 19:59.948
-[Tory] You can hear it...
-Mm-hm.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.618
and you can actually see it
cutting into the record.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.161
Now, what is this stuff?

20:04.244 --> 20:05.704
This is called swarf.

20:05.787 --> 20:09.666
It's the thing that's being pulled
out of the groove itself,

20:09.875 --> 20:12.336
-and it's actually really flammable.
-Oh, really?

20:12.878 --> 20:13.879
Like how flammable?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.298
-Pretty flammable.
-Like that?

20:17.341 --> 20:18.717
Yeah, that's pretty flammable.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.721
This is great, but what we need

20:22.804 --> 20:25.891
is a tiny record.
I mean, like an inch and a half.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.144
They don't traditionally make lacquer dubs

20:29.228 --> 20:32.022
in an inch and a half,
but we had some custom-made.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.901
-Oh!
-That ought to work.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.737
Oh, my God.
Doesn't give us a lot of time, does it?

20:38.820 --> 20:40.781
No, at 78 RPM,

20:40.864 --> 20:44.034
that's going to give us probably
about ten seconds.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.871
Is this the smallest record
you've ever made?

20:48.497 --> 20:52.376
This is the smallest record I've made.
And it took a lot of modifications

20:52.960 --> 20:55.003
to get this machine
to even cut this small.

20:55.879 --> 20:56.922
[playing upbeat music]

21:01.468 --> 21:02.469
[Tory] Oh, my God.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.304
It's so little.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.351
We've got the turntable,
we've got the record.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.478
Now all we need is the amplification horn.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.898
I decided I'm gonna use a 3D printer.

21:14.982 --> 21:18.193
I could have scratched something together,
but I mean, that's boring.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.236
This is way cooler.

21:19.319 --> 21:22.990
Besides, I'm using new technology
to make old technology.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.033
Printed in thermoplastic,

21:25.117 --> 21:28.120
I've knocked out a design
similar to the original.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.913
Oh, awesome.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.710
That's great, look at that. Perfect.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.962
It's the moment of truth.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.006
It's time to see if this thing works.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.345
[upbeat music playing]

21:47.931 --> 21:49.099
[laughs]

21:50.726 --> 21:55.522
It works. It actually plays music,
and this is just a prototype.

21:55.772 --> 21:59.359
Now, it's not that loud. But remember,
this is a personal listening device.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.570
You got to stick it right up
to your ear.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.823
As far as I'm concerned,
this is what inspired the iPod.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.533
That's the story I'm sticking to.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.911
So, how does it score?

22:09.995 --> 22:13.999
Criteria one, it was
an impressive 70 years ahead of its time.

22:14.082 --> 22:18.503
I'll go with four out of ten
for its resemblance to the modern version.

22:18.587 --> 22:22.215
And ingenuity?
As much as I love the miniaturization,

22:22.299 --> 22:24.551
none of the elements were groundbreaking.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.181
-[Kari and Grant laugh]
-There you go. Music on the run.

22:29.264 --> 22:32.017
I mean, not on the run 'cause it'll skip,
but it worked.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.060
And it was adorable.

22:33.143 --> 22:36.480
And if you had seen this back in the day,
it would've blown your mind.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.276
[Kari] My first attempt
at building and using

22:41.359 --> 22:43.945
an early form of in-car navigation

22:44.321 --> 22:49.326
was based on pictures of a device
called the Iter Auto from 1932.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.244
Come on. All right.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.579
We hit a serious roadblock.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.039
My map's out again.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.750
But remember this one?

22:57.209 --> 23:00.712
From 1909, it's called the Jones Live.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.091
And like the Iter Auto,
it's driven by the odometer cable.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.093
But instead of lots of scrolls,

23:06.593 --> 23:08.595
a whole map fits on one disc.

23:08.678 --> 23:12.516
And it predates the Iter Auto
by over two decades.

23:15.185 --> 23:19.856
Let's wind back the clock a hundred years
to see if we can make this one happen.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.569
The key component is
its tiny gearing system

23:24.653 --> 23:27.447
that syncs the map to the moving vehicle.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.951
It has a 1,000-to-1 ratio.

23:31.034 --> 23:33.453
It's gonna slow down
the rotational speed of our disc

23:33.537 --> 23:36.790
because all of the directions
are gonna happen within one rotation.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.209
And it's just so tiny and cute.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.465
All right. Time to take it for a spin.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.467
I'm plugging in the odometer cable...

23:48.468 --> 23:51.388
and getting the wheel moving
to 40 miles an hour.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.807
If the gearbox works,

23:53.890 --> 23:56.768
my disc should spin
at a fraction of the speed.

23:58.728 --> 23:59.563
All right.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.776
That is a 1,000-to-1 gear ratio.
Hold your hats!

24:05.735 --> 24:08.947
The final step in reviving
this navigation relic:

24:09.406 --> 24:11.241
Choose a route I wanna travel,

24:11.324 --> 24:14.536
measure the distance
between the turns exactly

24:14.619 --> 24:18.665
and calibrate those figures
to the speed my disc is going to turn.

24:22.043 --> 24:24.629
Okay, so this is my version

24:24.713 --> 24:27.549
of the 1909 Jones Live.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.843
Now, I've mapped out a route

24:29.926 --> 24:33.972
from our workshop
down to Pershing Square in downtown LA.

24:34.264 --> 24:37.267
Now, each one of these directions
and landmarks

24:37.350 --> 24:41.229
and the relative distance between them
was precisely measured from the map

24:41.313 --> 24:43.356
and then scaled to the rotation
of the disc.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.235
That means that as I approach
each one of these directions,

24:47.319 --> 24:49.571
they should appear in real time.

24:50.405 --> 24:53.992
I'd like to see how this stacks up
to modern technology.

24:54.075 --> 24:55.744
I'm gonna grab Grant and Tory,

24:55.827 --> 24:57.621
see if they're down for an experiment.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.084
-[Grant laughs]
-Did you get us new cars?

25:03.168 --> 25:05.504
What is this? [laughs]

25:05.587 --> 25:08.256
So, Tory,
you're gonna drive the Lamborghini Huracan

25:08.340 --> 25:11.176
and, Grant,
you're going to drive the BMW i3.

25:11.259 --> 25:12.886
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.763
Why? What are we doing?

25:14.846 --> 25:16.973
[Kari] I want you to be part of a test.
Give me your phone.

25:17.599 --> 25:22.479
I'm going to download
the latest crowdsourced navigation app,

25:22.562 --> 25:24.272
and I'm giving you an address.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.274
And for you...

25:27.275 --> 25:28.735
A paper map?

25:28.818 --> 25:31.112
I haven't seen one of these
for a million years.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.950
Yes, but I did give you a super high-tech
car that can practically drive itself.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.869
-So, can I use the onboard navigation?
-Absolutely not.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.747
This is a test.
I wanna see if my old tech,

25:40.830 --> 25:43.458
which I believe is super efficient
and ahead of its time,

25:43.541 --> 25:46.753
can stand up against the paper map
and the high-tech car,

25:46.836 --> 25:50.215
-and the supercar and navigation system.
-[Tory] How did I get so lucky?

25:50.298 --> 25:52.509
-[laughs]
-All right. So, this is a race?

25:52.592 --> 25:54.469
-Like three, two, one, go?
-Go!

25:55.387 --> 25:56.263
Three different cars.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.932
Three different navigation systems.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.308
One destination.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.019
Oh, my God. I can't believe it!

26:05.939 --> 26:07.565
It's Back to the Future...

26:08.149 --> 26:09.985
versus Driving Miss Daisy...

26:10.860 --> 26:12.195
versus Ferris Bueller.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.739
[laughs]

26:15.323 --> 26:16.491
Old school.

26:16.574 --> 26:17.450
New school.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.786
And kicked out of school.

26:22.455 --> 26:23.957
[in foreign accent]
It's a Lamborghini party.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.168
[female voice over phone] Traffic alert.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.461
Douche on the loose.

26:32.132 --> 26:35.176
[Kari] With four contenders duking it out
for top spot,

26:35.260 --> 26:37.012
here's a fifth to add to the mix.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.264
This time, the focus is on me.

26:40.473 --> 26:44.185
This invention has taken the world
by storm in just the last couple of years.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.897
You'll see it at any tourist landmark.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.607
It sells by the millions,

26:49.691 --> 26:52.027
but it's banned at Apple conferences,

26:52.652 --> 26:54.821
Disney parks and Wimbledon.

26:55.071 --> 26:55.905
Why?

26:56.323 --> 26:58.283
Because it's incredibly annoying.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.244
It's the selfie stick.

27:01.369 --> 27:05.040
Or as some people like to call it,
the narcissist-stick. Ooh.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.879
I mean, the selfie stick was so popular,

27:10.962 --> 27:15.050
it ranked TIME magazine's
Top 25 Inventions for 2014.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.134
Hashtag "selfie Saturday"!

27:17.469 --> 27:18.595
Brilliant.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.180
We got promised jetpacks.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.015
We got the selfie stick.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.933
So, the million dollar question,

27:24.017 --> 27:27.520
which was the original selfie stick,
who invented it and when?

27:28.938 --> 27:31.566
I guess that's more than one question.
[laughs]

27:31.649 --> 27:34.319
Anyway, first up,
selfies themselves aren't new.

27:34.402 --> 27:39.657
In fact, this shot, considered by many
to be the first photographic portrait,

27:39.741 --> 27:45.080
was a selfie taken by Philadelphia chemist
Robert Cornelius in 1839.

27:45.163 --> 27:48.958
He would just start the exposure,
jump in front of the camera for a minute,

27:49.042 --> 27:50.627
and then put the lens cap back on.

27:51.669 --> 27:53.129
Cornelius was far from alone.

27:53.213 --> 27:56.800
I mean, selfies were quite the rage
in the early days of photography.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.052
But we're not talking
about selfies as such.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.929
We're talking about the selfie stick.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.680
Who invented the original?

28:03.223 --> 28:05.683
Well, Canadian inventor
Wayne Fromm is a contender.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.102
Hey, Wayne.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.854
When do you claim
to have come up with the selfie stick?

28:10.355 --> 28:13.900
When I was showing consumers in 2006
with their cameras.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.404
And here's a patent filed in 2005
to prove it.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.407
But there's another patent.

28:21.491 --> 28:24.953
And that patent is 1985.
That's 20 years earlier.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.665
It was the work of this guy,
Hiroshi Ueda.

28:28.748 --> 28:32.419
He was a keen photographer who worked as
an engineer for camera company Minolta.

28:33.586 --> 28:37.465
He invented it after he asked someone
to take a photo of him outside the Louvre.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.300
And then they ran off.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.762
Hiroshi's design was manufactured
and went to market.

28:42.846 --> 28:47.183
But it didn't sell well,
and the patent ran out in 2003.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.646
But was Hiroshi the first inventor
of the selfie stick?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.231
Actually, no.

28:53.314 --> 28:57.694
Check out this photo by one Arnold Hogg
in 1926. See that pole?

28:58.278 --> 28:59.279
Zoom in.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.282
There you have it. Stick...

29:02.907 --> 29:03.783
Camera...

29:04.367 --> 29:05.368
Remote control...

29:06.619 --> 29:07.495
Selfie stick.

29:09.164 --> 29:13.126
So, score.
Years before the modern invention, 79.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.295
Resemblance to its contemporary?

29:15.378 --> 29:17.964
That's almost as good as
a modern selfie stick.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.632
Ingenuity?

29:19.716 --> 29:21.509
It's not rocket science, is it?

29:34.439 --> 29:36.983
[Grant] Remember the days
when people listened to records...

29:39.110 --> 29:40.320
cassette tapes...

29:42.322 --> 29:43.615
and compact discs?

29:45.658 --> 29:48.411
You know,
when your music collection was physical?

29:52.373 --> 29:53.249
Times have changed.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.752
Today, you no longer have to own music.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.047
You can choose to stream it
from a remote location.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.799
A music cloud.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.717
[choir] ♪ Hallelujah ♪

30:04.427 --> 30:06.346
[Grant] You have access to it 24/7.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.265
And you can listen to it over your phone.

30:09.808 --> 30:13.603
In short, streaming has revolutionized
the music industry...

30:14.145 --> 30:16.189
ever since it was first introduced...

30:17.816 --> 30:19.609
in 1906?

30:23.154 --> 30:25.073
-Hello, operator?
-[woman] Hello, sir.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.283
Can you connect me to the Telharmonium,
please?

30:27.367 --> 30:28.409
Certainly, sir.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.411
They're connecting us now.

30:30.995 --> 30:34.707
[Grant] That's right.
Way before Napster, Rdio and Spotify,

30:34.791 --> 30:35.792
[music playing over phone]

30:35.875 --> 30:38.169
the world's first streaming service

30:38.253 --> 30:40.421
began in New York
with the device called...

30:41.005 --> 30:42.257
the Telharmonium.

30:43.258 --> 30:46.261
Oh, honey, it's amazing.
Music? From the telephone?

30:46.344 --> 30:48.263
It's the sound of the future.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.014
What a world we live in!

30:52.225 --> 30:54.143
Whatever will they think of next?

30:54.727 --> 30:57.313
And the genius behind this invention?

30:58.273 --> 30:59.357
Thaddeus Cahill.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.734
Cahill was a young inventor

31:01.818 --> 31:05.321
who was fascinated with two of
the greatest inventions of the time.

31:06.865 --> 31:07.949
Electricity

31:08.449 --> 31:09.659
and the telephone.

31:10.618 --> 31:12.495
Now, he was also a music lover.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.039
Hello.

31:15.790 --> 31:17.208
Do you have any Snoop Dogg?

31:17.792 --> 31:18.751
So, he had an idea.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.712
Not Deputy Dawg, Snoop Dogg!

31:21.296 --> 31:25.008
Why not use electricity to generate
the music directly?

31:25.091 --> 31:26.384
AC/DC.

31:26.926 --> 31:27.760
Metal, baby!

31:29.429 --> 31:30.555
Now, Cahill's dream

31:31.097 --> 31:34.058
was to create an electronic music machine

31:34.183 --> 31:37.270
capable of mimicking
the sound of an entire orchestra

31:37.353 --> 31:41.900
with sufficient resonance to be played
over a small telephone speaker

31:41.983 --> 31:43.735
and fill a room with sound.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.283
So, he started experimenting
with cogs and magnets.

31:50.366 --> 31:53.912
If you take a cog wheel like this sprocket
right here with all these teeth,

31:53.995 --> 31:54.913
and you spin it...

31:55.455 --> 31:56.497
[whirring]

31:56.581 --> 31:58.416
and you take an electrical pickup,

31:58.499 --> 32:00.293
and you bring it close to it...

32:00.877 --> 32:01.753
you'll get...

32:02.086 --> 32:03.296
[tone playing]

32:04.589 --> 32:05.423
a tone.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.676
[tone playing]

32:09.469 --> 32:12.847
Now, if you had enough of these cog wheels
in enough sizes,

32:12.931 --> 32:15.183
you could make an entire musical scale.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.060
Which is exactly what Cahill did.

32:18.603 --> 32:22.649
Using a large array of massive,
metallic tone wheels for those notes,

32:22.732 --> 32:24.442
and after adding a keyboard...

32:24.525 --> 32:25.526
You guessed it.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.863
Basically, Cahill created
the world's first synthesizer.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.117
Now, it was so complicated,
it required two organists.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.452
And it was huge.

32:35.161 --> 32:35.995
No, literally.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.373
Physically gigantic.

32:39.707 --> 32:43.753
A series of control cables connected
the keyboards to what Cahill called

32:43.836 --> 32:45.421
his music plant.

32:46.547 --> 32:48.883
It consisted of miles of cable,

32:48.967 --> 32:51.803
generators, banks of spinning rotors,

32:51.970 --> 32:54.931
alternators, transformers
and switchboards.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.268
All told, it was 60 feet long,

32:59.435 --> 33:03.523
weighed almost 200 tons and it
took up the entire basement floor

33:03.606 --> 33:05.274
of its building on Broadway.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.860
So the organist played,

33:07.944 --> 33:12.031
and electronic music was pumped through
the New York telephone system.

33:14.033 --> 33:17.412
The world's first streaming music service
had arrived.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.206
Hello, do you have any Jay Z?

33:20.790 --> 33:23.960
To find out more about this
amazing invention and inventor...

33:24.544 --> 33:27.422
How about Taylor Swift?
She's a swell dame.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.424
I got on the phone to an expert.

33:30.008 --> 33:34.220
Electricity and electromagnetism were
so poorly understood at the time.

33:34.303 --> 33:38.182
So, it's amazing that
Thaddeus Cahill was able to create

33:38.266 --> 33:42.311
this new, large technology made out of
something that was still so mysterious.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.814
It's sort of like coming up with

33:44.897 --> 33:49.861
a practical application for quantum
tunneling here in 2016.

33:49.944 --> 33:51.320
Sixty feet.

33:51.487 --> 33:52.989
Two hundred tons.

33:53.614 --> 33:56.451
Why did the Telharmonium
have to be so huge?

33:56.534 --> 33:58.619
The amplifier hadn't been invented yet.

33:58.703 --> 34:02.290
And so, when you tried to send anything
to 10,000 people

34:02.373 --> 34:04.250
across telephone networks,

34:04.333 --> 34:07.795
you needed to start with one big signal
capable of vibrating

34:07.879 --> 34:09.922
10,000 little speakers out at the end.

34:10.006 --> 34:12.508
We're talking about a piece
of cutting-edge technology

34:12.592 --> 34:14.343
the size of a small power plant.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.429
As you can imagine,

34:16.512 --> 34:20.266
there's a good reason why there
are no surviving Telharmoniums today.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.686
And, unfortunately, no audio recordings.

34:24.270 --> 34:27.982
But there are tens of thousands
of mini-me music generators

34:28.066 --> 34:30.193
that use the Telharmonium template.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.862
The Hammond Organ.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.324
-Hey, Nate, how's it going?
-Hi, Grant.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.286
So, what is it
about this organ in particular

34:40.369 --> 34:44.123
that makes it the closest relative
to the Telharmonium?

34:44.207 --> 34:48.336
Well, it's the heart of the Hammond Organ
that is the most like it.

34:48.419 --> 34:50.129
It's the tone wheel generator.

34:50.213 --> 34:54.258
It uses a bank of 91 rotating discs
as oscillators.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.886
-Physically spinning disks?
-Exactly.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.554
Just like the Telharmonium had,

34:58.638 --> 35:00.515
only on a much smaller scale.

35:01.099 --> 35:01.974
[Grant] That's right.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.520
The principle behind the Telharmonium
and the Hammond Organ is the same.

35:06.145 --> 35:09.649
But the Hammond Organ has
the benefit of modern amplification

35:09.732 --> 35:11.651
so it can be much smaller.

35:11.734 --> 35:13.402
But in Cahill's day,

35:13.486 --> 35:16.155
his tone wheels had to be enormous.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.408
[whirring]

35:20.159 --> 35:21.577
[Nathan] I have a little experiment.

35:21.661 --> 35:25.623
These test leads go
to this 1906 telephone.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.376
And I also have an oscilloscope hooked up.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.419
If I clip one lead to ground

35:30.503 --> 35:32.964
and one lead to an output
of the tone wheel,

35:33.047 --> 35:34.757
you can actually see the sine.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.342
-I can hear it through here?
-Yeah.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.427
[tone humming]

35:38.511 --> 35:39.971
[laughs]

35:40.054 --> 35:42.431
Yeah, I hear it. It's a sine wave.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.979
Combining those tones with a keyboard,

35:48.062 --> 35:51.691
the Telharmonium could synthesize music
and play it through the phone.

35:51.774 --> 35:53.317
[tones playing]

35:55.611 --> 35:59.282
You do realize this is the first time in
over 100 years somebody has tried this?

35:59.365 --> 36:01.909
-Isn't it wonderful? [laughs]
-[laughs] It's amazing.

36:03.202 --> 36:07.999
In 1907, the Telharmonium was
on the front page of Scientific American,

36:08.082 --> 36:11.294
and subscribers range
from the Waldorf Astoria

36:11.377 --> 36:13.171
to the first private subscriber,

36:13.254 --> 36:17.133
an early technology adopter
by the name of Mark Twain.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.301
However,

36:18.384 --> 36:22.930
by 1908, the Telharmonium had
less than two miles of wires installed.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.183
The project was bleeding money.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.393
There were also some technical issues.

36:27.476 --> 36:30.688
Customers would get crosstalk
from a conversation on another line.

36:30.771 --> 36:33.524
[people talking indistinctly over phone]

36:33.608 --> 36:36.527
Remember, this was
a telephone-based delivery system.

36:37.111 --> 36:40.031
Ultimately, Cahill's invention was
a victim of its time.

36:40.740 --> 36:44.702
It was doomed from the start
by its enormous size and cost.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.829
It's time to score Thaddeus Cahill

36:46.913 --> 36:49.624
and his amazing Telharmonium
using our criteria.

36:49.707 --> 36:50.541
Number one:

36:51.125 --> 36:54.587
Years before modern invention.
This one's gonna score pretty high.

36:55.171 --> 36:58.925
A hundred and two years
before modern music streaming arrived.

36:59.425 --> 37:02.595
Criteria two:
Resemblance to the modern invention.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.388
It's a music streaming service

37:04.472 --> 37:07.225
available 24 hours a day,

37:07.642 --> 37:10.394
by subscription over your phone.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.523
Criteria three: Ingenuity?

37:15.191 --> 37:16.442
Off the charts.

37:16.525 --> 37:19.987
It was the world's first
electro-mechanical instrument.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.032
The precursor to the Hammond Organ
and the synthesizer.

37:23.115 --> 37:26.410
Not to mention the enormity
of the engineering undertaking

37:26.494 --> 37:28.496
to bring this music into people's homes.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.123
Whatever will they think of next?

37:31.707 --> 37:32.792
Safe to say...

37:32.917 --> 37:34.001
the technology...

37:34.377 --> 37:37.463
and the world wasn't ready
for music streaming.

37:37.546 --> 37:38.589
At least not yet.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.222
All right, here we go.

37:47.473 --> 37:48.683
Oh, yeah.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.480
I'm testing out
my 1909 in-car navigation system

37:54.563 --> 37:56.065
in a race to Pershing Square

37:56.148 --> 37:57.566
in downtown LA.

37:59.735 --> 38:02.113
An elegant American icon
is going up against

38:02.196 --> 38:04.323
a shining star of Japanese tech...

38:05.366 --> 38:08.536
and... a flashy Italian show pony.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.872
But enough about the drivers.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.667
[laughs] This car's awesome.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.253
I'm in a 1933 Packard Eight Touring.

38:17.878 --> 38:22.383
Top speed, 80 mph, and it's equipped with
the Jones Live navigation wheel.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.886
[Grant] I'm in a BMW i3.

38:26.804 --> 38:30.641
It's small. It's easy to park.
It's got good range.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.768
It's a cutting-edge electric car.

38:32.852 --> 38:36.856
But Kari's making me navigate
with an old-fashioned paper map.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.152
[whoops]

38:41.777 --> 38:43.863
[Tory] And I'm in a Lamborghini Huracan.

38:44.363 --> 38:47.116
Ten cylinders, 610 horsepower!

38:48.117 --> 38:49.493
To get to my destination,

38:49.577 --> 38:51.954
I'm using the latest crowdsourced app.

38:57.418 --> 39:01.881
That 1,000-to-1 gearbox is clicking
it by nice and slow. It's good.

39:02.465 --> 39:06.052
Maybe I'm overconfident,
but I think my 1909 navigation system

39:06.135 --> 39:08.220
will help me beat
at least one of the boys.

39:10.222 --> 39:12.350
Okay, map says to turn right.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.270
Yeah, it seems to be working so far.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.314
[Tory] Good luck with that.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.775
Crowdsourcing navigation is the future.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.985
[female voice over phone]
Turn left onto 6th Street.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.821
[Tory] The app reviews my route
every few seconds

39:25.905 --> 39:27.990
using real-time traffic conditions.

39:28.574 --> 39:30.743
[female voice]
User-reported traffic incident ahead.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.205
Recalculating route.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.832
She sounds really nice. [laughs]

39:43.089 --> 39:44.673
[Grant] It's so stupid.

39:44.757 --> 39:48.219
But this is what we used to do.
Back in the day, kids.

39:48.719 --> 39:52.431
Trying to read a paper map
on these streets? Please.

39:52.515 --> 39:56.477
Look at that... all of Los Angeles.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.646
[Tory] This is ridiculous.

39:58.729 --> 39:59.688
[horn honks]

39:59.772 --> 40:03.401
This kind of traffic is supposed to be
ideal for the crowdsourced app

40:03.484 --> 40:05.778
because it can adapt to conditions.

40:05.861 --> 40:08.280
[female voice] In 300 feet, turn right.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.783
Oh, my God.
Why are you going this way?

40:11.867 --> 40:13.536
But it has its flaws.

40:13.619 --> 40:14.954
Are you kidding me?

40:15.496 --> 40:18.833
Right now,
I am literally driving down an alley.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.252
Now I have to cross four lanes of traffic

40:21.877 --> 40:26.841
in order to get to the other side
of the street and go down the alley.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.384
[horns honking]

40:28.467 --> 40:31.095
Sorry. I'm an [honk] hole.
I'm the [honk] hole here.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.267
All right, so now it says we go...

40:36.767 --> 40:37.601
left.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.146
And it seems to be...

40:40.229 --> 40:43.232
telling me to turn when it's time to turn,
so...

40:43.482 --> 40:44.859
So far, I'm loving this.

40:47.027 --> 40:49.530
I think I'm gonna have to pull over.

40:49.613 --> 40:50.614
My biggest problem...

40:50.698 --> 40:52.324
I don't know where to go next.

40:52.908 --> 40:55.911
I lose valuable time
whenever I need to consult the map.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.914
You are a one-way street.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.833
Oh, good. Thank you, map,

41:00.916 --> 41:02.251
for not telling me.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.504
Is this even the right city?

41:05.588 --> 41:06.714
[horn honks]

41:07.923 --> 41:10.342
[Kari]
Time to kick this race into high gear.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.013
Whoo-hoo. Whoops.

41:14.096 --> 41:15.139
[gears grinding]

41:15.222 --> 41:16.807
Actually, any gear will do.

41:17.808 --> 41:18.642
[horn honks]

41:19.268 --> 41:21.103
[female voice] New data incoming.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.731
-[sighs]
-Recalculating route.

41:23.814 --> 41:24.732
[groans]

41:25.941 --> 41:27.193
I have to do this.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.945
Something that no man likes doing.

41:30.571 --> 41:32.573
Let's find somebody nice.

41:35.117 --> 41:38.287
Hi, can you tell me how
to get to Pershing Square?

41:39.788 --> 41:42.374
Getting close. I wanna beat the boys.
My tech can do it.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.251
-[horn honks]
-[inaudible dialogue]

41:44.335 --> 41:45.586
Okay, two lights.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.755
Make a left, make a right.

41:49.256 --> 41:50.466
[Kari] My hundred-year-old tech

41:50.549 --> 41:54.094
has given me a clean run
through this 21st century city.

41:58.432 --> 41:59.433
Now who's here first?

42:00.768 --> 42:02.561
Surely, I couldn't have won?

42:05.272 --> 42:06.148
Yeah!

42:06.774 --> 42:07.650
No!

42:08.234 --> 42:12.321
-[laughs] Oh.
-Oh, finally. I've been here forever.

42:12.821 --> 42:14.782
But, wait, where's Tory?

42:14.865 --> 42:16.325
[engine revving]

42:16.408 --> 42:17.701
Forget this competition.

42:19.036 --> 42:19.912
I'm out of here.

42:21.580 --> 42:23.415
-[Kari laughs]
-Well, that was fun.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.292
Traditional map came in first.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.460
Yeah, but you cheated.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.672
Oh, what? Asking for directions?
You didn't even show up to the end.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.131
Oh, I win by default.

42:31.215 --> 42:34.176
Because you cheated
and because you didn't show up.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.470
[laughs] All right,
let's go over the criteria.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.471
Criteria number one:

42:37.555 --> 42:40.975
How many years before modern-day GPS
was this used?

42:41.058 --> 42:43.936
Eighty-one years before a satellite
navigation system was in a car.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.813
All right. Criteria number two:

42:45.896 --> 42:48.440
How close to a modern-day GPS
was your device?

42:48.524 --> 42:50.859
Hang on a minute.
We have to dock you a few points.

42:50.943 --> 42:54.989
You can't enter any destination
from any origin and get directions.

42:55.072 --> 42:56.407
You have to do set routes.

42:56.490 --> 42:57.741
True, but it's a precursor.

42:57.825 --> 43:00.703
You gotta start somewhere.
They hadn't invented satellites yet.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.247
Let's talk criteria number three:
Ingenuity.

43:03.872 --> 43:05.291
This one's pretty clever.

43:05.374 --> 43:10.004
It's synchronized in real time to a moving
car back then, way ahead of its time.

43:10.087 --> 43:13.465
We've just been on a journey to find
ahead-of-their-time inventions.

43:13.549 --> 43:17.886
Familiar, modern technologies invented
years before their modern equivalents.

43:18.470 --> 43:21.056
Let's rank them using findings
from our three criteria:

43:21.640 --> 43:23.058
Years before the modern invention,

43:23.142 --> 43:24.685
resemblance to modern invention

43:24.768 --> 43:26.604
and ingenuity factor.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.773
Hello. This is the world's first call
on a portable telephone.

43:29.857 --> 43:33.694
Actually, there was a cell phone call
many years before this.

43:35.070 --> 43:37.823
[Kari] At number six,
Eve's wireless telephone.

43:37.906 --> 43:41.118
Sounded like a mobile phone
and looked like a mobile phone,

43:41.201 --> 43:43.537
but turned out to be a crystal radio.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.957
Turns out it wasn't a cell phone.

43:47.041 --> 43:47.875
I'm so sorry.

43:48.417 --> 43:49.251
[grunts]

43:49.543 --> 43:51.879
[Kari] At number five,
the portable music device.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.590
Seventy years ahead of the Walkman

43:54.673 --> 43:56.634
and a masterpiece of miniaturization,

43:56.717 --> 43:58.844
but light on song choice.

43:58.927 --> 43:59.887
Ooh.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.847
Number four, the selfie stick.

44:01.930 --> 44:06.727
Modern narcissism was beaten to the punch
by Arnold Hogg in 1926.

44:06.810 --> 44:07.645
Camera...

44:08.062 --> 44:09.063
Remote control...

44:09.521 --> 44:10.522
Selfie stick.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.150
But points for ingenuity?

44:13.233 --> 44:14.777
Hardly rocket science!

44:15.402 --> 44:18.864
At number three,
early attempts at in-car navigation.

44:18.947 --> 44:20.574
We brought the Iter Auto back to life

44:20.658 --> 44:23.702
and found the scrolling map system
had severe limitations.

44:23.786 --> 44:24.995
[tires screeching]

44:25.120 --> 44:26.538
My map's out again.

44:27.414 --> 44:30.292
But the Jones Live
synchronized map wheel...

44:30.376 --> 44:31.919
It seems to be working so far.

44:32.002 --> 44:35.339
got me to my destination
and was 81 years ahead of its time.

44:35.923 --> 44:38.175
In the number two spot, the Telharmonium.

44:38.759 --> 44:41.261
A music streaming service
available 24 hours a day

44:41.345 --> 44:44.306
by subscription over your phone line,
in 1906.

44:44.390 --> 44:46.016
It's the sound of the future.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.727
A precursor of the modern synthesizer,

44:48.811 --> 44:51.522
this scored high in
all three of our criteria.

44:51.647 --> 44:53.023
And a close runner up to...

44:54.024 --> 44:56.902
our number one invention
before its time, the GIF.

44:56.985 --> 45:00.948
In 1879,
Eadweard Muybridge set out to settle a bet

45:01.031 --> 45:02.783
about horse feet leaving the ground.

45:02.866 --> 45:08.038
In the process, inventing looping video
that predated an Internet phenomenon

45:08.122 --> 45:10.374
by 108 years.

45:11.917 --> 45:15.045
And that's how our
six inventions before their time lined up.

45:15.629 --> 45:17.840
Aha! I knew my guy Muybridge would win.

45:17.923 --> 45:20.884
His looping images predate
even motion pictures.

45:20.968 --> 45:23.137
-But I had a time machine.
-How come you didn't win?

45:23.220 --> 45:26.181
-You should be on the top of the list.
-Don't need to.
