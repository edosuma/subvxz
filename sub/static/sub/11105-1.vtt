Down there?

03:18.898 --> 03:19.922
Dad?

03:19.999 --> 03:21.796
Harriet priestly
Just called your mama.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.460
Her husband
Drove by the store

03:23.536 --> 03:24.969
And said the lights
Were still on.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.132
What are the lights
Still doing on?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.267
I'm cookin' the books
As usual, dad.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.436
The sign, guy.
The sign is still on.

03:32.512 --> 03:34.707
Are we open for business
All night now?

03:34.781 --> 03:37.375
No. Sorry. I, uh,
I'll turn that right off.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.112
Is that music playing on one
Of the store hi-fis?

03:40.186 --> 03:41.585
I'll turn that
Right off, too.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.054
"Turn that off, too."

03:53.633 --> 03:54.793
Dang.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.731
Ohh.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.073
But I thought you
Already decided on the echoes.

04:05.144 --> 04:07.271
Nah. Some band
In buffalo's the echoes.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.008
Anyway, I wasn't
Wild about that.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.379
Let's just...

04:10.450 --> 04:13.044
Call us the...band
You're about to hear.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.609
How 'bout
The corvettes?

04:14.687 --> 04:17.178
Is that the corvettes
Or the chordvettes?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.986
No. Corvettes,
Like the car.

04:19.058 --> 04:20.923
Well, see, I was thinkin',
Like, the chord...

04:23.162 --> 04:25.926
Chordvettes.
Like chords in our music.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.967
No.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.526
here you are.
That's 10 cents.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.935
Is that
Skitch patterson?

04:33.006 --> 04:34.598
- hi.
- hey there.
Mornin', everybody.

04:34.674 --> 04:35.698
Mornin'.
Hey, guy.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.436
Well, here we are.
Erie's lone beatnik.

04:37.510 --> 04:38.477
Any others?

04:38.544 --> 04:40.774
What about the tempos?
You know, tempos?

04:40.847 --> 04:42.781
Not the tempos.
Tempos...

04:42.849 --> 04:45.340
I was in a band already
Called the tempos.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.851
We were...

04:46.919 --> 04:48.181
Terrible.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.654
Hey, guy, weren't
You the drummer in the tempos?

04:50.723 --> 04:52.350
Heard that.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.521
I keep comin' back
To the herdsmen.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.086
How 'bout
The big tippers?

04:58.164 --> 04:59.961
I like it.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.435
Ok, skitch.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.698
You wanna experience
Shame tonight?

05:05.772 --> 05:08.400
We're playin' the mercyhurst
College talent show.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.704
It's gonna be
Hilarious.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.803
Jimmy and the herdsmen.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.848
Chad gonna solo
On wipeout?

05:15.915 --> 05:18.713
Oh, you know, every song
Is wipeout to chad.

05:18.785 --> 05:19.774
Enjoy your breakfast.

05:19.852 --> 05:20.841
See ya, faye.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.012
I gotta pass,

05:22.088 --> 05:24.579
But if you kids
Need any new wires or plugs,

05:24.657 --> 05:25.783
Give me a call.

05:25.858 --> 05:27.826
All right, well,
You're gonna miss it.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.862
College giris, co-eds...
By the fistful.

05:29.929 --> 05:32.591
Ooh, hey, my dad
Wants a roto-antenna.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.792
Tell him to come by
The store.

05:34.867 --> 05:37.836
He already talked
To a salesman at tele-mart.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.099
That's a big mistake.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.973
Lenny, those cats
Don't know squat about service.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.780
Hey, hey, hey.
Lookin' good.

05:50.850 --> 05:51.976
Hmm?

05:56.723 --> 05:57.690
Morning.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.850
Don't we open at 10:00
On saturdays?

05:59.926 --> 06:02.360
Yes, we do.
And it's a good thing.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.964
You know,
Like the flock that follows,

06:07.033 --> 06:08.762
But it's like " herds"
With a e-a.

06:08.835 --> 06:09.893
So it's like
Heardsmen,

06:09.969 --> 06:11.766
- so it's one of
The six senses.
- right.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.135
So it's spelled
Like that.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.298
What do you
Think?

06:14.374 --> 06:15.306
A big herd.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.307
Heards.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.468
I don't get it.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.807
No, it's spelled like this,
So it's heards,

06:19.879 --> 06:22.905
So it's one of the senses.
Music heards.

06:22.982 --> 06:24.950
I don't-
I don't get it.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.814
Yeah, do it.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.148
Oh, heards,
Like hear.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.550
Yes. It's, like,
Heardsmen.

06:31.624 --> 06:32.784
Heardsmen.

06:32.859 --> 06:35.453
Oh, no. Oh. Ow.

06:37.497 --> 06:38.759
Guys.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.799
Chad fell down.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.832
Ok, venus?

06:41.901 --> 06:42.959
Ok, steve.

06:43.035 --> 06:43.967
Right.

06:44.036 --> 06:45.469
Let's go.

06:50.376 --> 06:51.502
Unh!

07:06.359 --> 07:07.690
Oh, hey.

07:08.628 --> 07:09.652
Look at this.

07:09.729 --> 07:10.787
See this?

07:10.863 --> 07:12.455
My grandma and i
Watched this.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.159
Three weeks,
We've been watching it,

07:14.233 --> 07:16.997
And last week, she realizes
There's strings.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.162
They're puppets.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.432
Yeah.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.371
They're marionettes.
That's what they are.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.069
What can I help you with
Today, gentlemen?

07:24.143 --> 07:27.271
We have a big proposition
For you, guy.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.405

Just for tonight.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.391
Why?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.487
Asshole...

07:44.564 --> 07:47.226
Just broke his arm.

07:54.373 --> 07:56.773
Let's check out these clock radios
Over here, huh?

07:56.843 --> 07:58.071
Oh, yeah.

07:58.144 --> 08:02.012
Would anyone notice
If chad busted his arm? Ha ha.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.242
These are the clock radios,
Fellas.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.982
So...what's this tune?

08:09.055 --> 08:12.149
Well, it's an original
That I wrote.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.249
Hey.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.554
We wrote.

08:14.627 --> 08:16.117

You can't handle.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.322
It's just for tonight.

08:18.397 --> 08:19.796
And if we win,

08:19.866 --> 08:21.595
We split $100.

08:22.635 --> 08:23.659
Um...

08:23.736 --> 08:24.896
Wow.

08:25.972 --> 08:28.668
Playin'
In a group again.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.538
Man, that sounds
Like fun.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.842
All right,
Here's the deal.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.886
If you want
These magic hands,

08:41.953 --> 08:44.752
You gotta buy two
New record needles.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.190
And this radio.

08:51.631 --> 08:52.962
Are you serious?

08:54.333 --> 08:56.267
It's 14.95 on sale.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.963
How 'bout
A washing machine, too?

08:59.038 --> 09:00.665
Yeah, ok.

09:02.008 --> 09:06.411

Just to see you go

09:06.479 --> 09:10.643

09:10.716 --> 09:15.278
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing

09:15.354 --> 09:19.848
And every day,
Just doin' that thing

09:19.926 --> 09:25.728
I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do

09:32.705 --> 09:33.933
Perfect, man.

09:34.006 --> 09:36.270
Very good.
Took chad a week to learn that.

09:36.342 --> 09:39.140
Chad. Who's ch-chad?

09:39.211 --> 09:40.508
Just one song, right?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.979

09:42.048 --> 09:43.447
One-derful.

09:46.285 --> 09:47.445
I gotta go.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.817
That's it...

09:48.888 --> 09:51.118
Guy patterson.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.851
That's it-
The one-ders!

09:52.925 --> 09:55.758
And then, you know how,
Like the beatles-the beatles,

09:55.828 --> 09:57.796
They use an e-a
As the beatles?

09:57.863 --> 10:00.661
Well, we can use an o-n-e
Like the one-ders.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.098
You're talkin'
Gibberish.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.726
No, look.

10:05.504 --> 10:06.835
The one-ders.

10:06.906 --> 10:07.873
Lenny.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.534
Yeah, it looks like
The o-neders.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.840
No. The-the one-ders.

10:12.912 --> 10:15.176
Got it. Looks like
The o-neders.

10:15.281 --> 10:19.183
Oh, I can hear
The children laughing

10:19.251 --> 10:22.812
I can hear
The children laughing

10:22.888 --> 10:26.289
Yes, I hear
The children laughing

10:26.359 --> 10:29.851
And it's not far

10:29.929 --> 10:33.365
No, it's not
Far away

10:33.432 --> 10:36.663
No, it's not far

10:36.736 --> 10:40.695
And I hear
The river flowing

10:40.773 --> 10:42.297
Yes, I hear...

10:42.375 --> 10:45.572
Hey! You're drowning
In the river! You're drowning!

10:45.645 --> 10:47.772
Hear the river flowing

10:47.847 --> 10:51.146
And it's not far

10:51.217 --> 10:54.744
No, it's not
Far away

10:54.820 --> 10:58.620
No, it's not far

10:58.691 --> 11:00.056
This is hardly
A date, guy.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.991
I thought we were
Going to the movies

11:02.061 --> 11:04.188
And dinner
At the club.

11:04.263 --> 11:05.958
We're gonna cream
These ladies.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.659
Well, how long

11:07.733 --> 11:10.702
Guy, I've been looking for you
Everywhere. You got to set up.

11:10.770 --> 11:11.998
Oh. Ok. Um...

11:14.507 --> 11:16.441
Through the door,
By the stage.

Great.

To one of these things before.

Nice to meet you.

Emcee: oh, well.

12:38.224 --> 12:42.024
Hey, how do you sell
A chicken to a deaf man?

12:42.094 --> 12:43.026
You're
A jerkhead!

12:43.095 --> 12:44.255
You say,

12:44.330 --> 12:47.128
" hey, would you
Like to buy a chicken?!"

12:47.199 --> 12:48.325
Eat my shorts,

12:48.400 --> 12:50.994
Shut up!
I'll kick your ass.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.069
Are you ready?

12:57.143 --> 12:58.110
Ready.

12:58.177 --> 12:59.769
Oh, yeah,
Just one, please.

12:59.845 --> 13:00.937
Hi. Have fun.

13:01.013 --> 13:03.504
this next group,
They're all locals.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.709
They call erie home.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.151
The...o-neders.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.881
all right,
Let's go!

13:09.955 --> 13:11.217
That's "the one-ders."

13:14.059 --> 13:15.924
1, 2, 3, 4.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.656
That's too fast,
Guy. Slow down!

13:17.730 --> 13:18.992
Come on, come on.

13:19.064 --> 13:22.158
Slow down! Too fast!
Slow it down!

13:22.234 --> 13:23.861
You

13:23.936 --> 13:26.905
Doin' that thing
You do

13:26.972 --> 13:29.372
Aw, come on.
That's too fast.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.932
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces

13:32.011 --> 13:35.139
Like you always do

13:35.214 --> 13:36.772
And you

13:36.849 --> 13:40.012
Don't mean to be cruel

13:40.085 --> 13:42.246
You never even knew

13:42.321 --> 13:44.516
About the heartache

13:44.590 --> 13:47.582
I've been
Goin' through

13:47.660 --> 13:48.592
And I try...

13:48.661 --> 13:51.061
Aw, come on,
Guy. Aw.

13:51.130 --> 13:54.759
But it's just
So hard to do

13:54.834 --> 13:59.931
Every time you do
That thing you do

14:01.574 --> 14:02.734
I

14:02.808 --> 14:06.073
Know all the games
You play

14:06.145 --> 14:10.946
I'm gonna find a way
To let you know that

14:11.016 --> 14:13.849
You'll be mine someday

14:13.919 --> 14:15.819
'Cause we

14:15.888 --> 14:19.119
Could be happy,
Can't you see?

14:19.191 --> 14:24.060
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you

14:24.129 --> 14:26.927
And keep you here
With me

14:26.999 --> 14:30.298
Yes, I try and I try
To forget you, girl

14:30.369 --> 14:33.338
But it's just
So hard to do

14:33.405 --> 14:38.172
Every time you do
That thing you do

14:40.145 --> 14:41.373
I...

14:41.447 --> 14:43.472
Man, what's
Goin' on here?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.244
No one...

14:45.317 --> 14:46.579
It's all right!

14:46.652 --> 14:47.949
You're a lucky man!

14:48.020 --> 14:49.749
An unhappy guy, girl

14:49.822 --> 14:54.316
And I just can't
Take it anymore

15:08.240 --> 15:09.605
'Cause we

15:09.675 --> 15:13.008
Could be happy,
Can't you see?

15:13.078 --> 15:18.209
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you

15:18.284 --> 15:21.253
And keep you here
With me

15:21.320 --> 15:24.756
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go

15:24.823 --> 15:27.849
Around with someone new

15:27.927 --> 15:32.264
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing

15:32.397 --> 15:34.763
Every day,
Just doin' that thing

15:34.833 --> 15:39.702
And I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do

15:43.408 --> 15:46.275
Oh, my goodness!

15:46.344 --> 15:47.470
That was fantastic!

15:47.545 --> 15:49.172
That was way
Too fast, man.

15:49.247 --> 15:50.771
It's a ballad!

15:50.849 --> 15:51.838
You're right.

15:51.916 --> 15:54.248
No, it was great!
It was great!

15:56.021 --> 15:57.545
Oh, that's wicked!

15:57.622 --> 15:59.351
That's sure wicked!

15:59.424 --> 16:03.019
The o-neders
Are the champions!

16:03.094 --> 16:06.495
Because they do
That thing you do!

16:06.564 --> 16:08.259
That was great!
That was great, you guys!

16:08.333 --> 16:09.960
Come over here.
I wanna talk to you.

16:10.035 --> 16:11.229
You ever been
To villapiano's?

16:11.303 --> 16:13.203
What, the spaghetti place
Out by the airport

16:13.271 --> 16:14.465
That's been
In the papers?

16:14.539 --> 16:16.473
Yeah. I gotta have ya.
I just gotta have ya.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.202
I want you playin'
At my place next weekend.

16:18.276 --> 16:19.709
What do you say, huh?

16:19.778 --> 16:21.405
will there
Be money involved?

16:21.479 --> 16:23.344
I'll pay you 100 bucks.
How's that?

16:23.415 --> 16:24.677
we'll do it.

16:24.749 --> 16:27.582
Yeah! Yeah, yeah!

16:30.288 --> 16:31.346
Ooh!

16:33.992 --> 16:35.220
I don't know.

16:35.293 --> 16:38.160
It's like I could hear
The beat in my head, you know.

16:39.864 --> 16:40.853
Pull over!

16:40.932 --> 16:43.059
Hey! You guys are wicked!

16:43.134 --> 16:44.567
You even drive
Too fast!

16:44.636 --> 16:46.797
What are you doin' with him?
He's a drummer!

16:46.871 --> 16:47.860
Hey, one-ders!

16:47.939 --> 16:49.099
- whoo!
- whoo!

16:49.174 --> 16:51.608
I don't know.
I haven't played in front of people

16:51.676 --> 16:53.303
In so long,
So I was nervous.

16:53.378 --> 16:54.743
But it sounds
Better fast.

16:54.813 --> 16:57.077
Jimmy wanted it slow,
But he was wrong.

16:57.148 --> 16:58.945
It's an up-tempo number.

16:59.017 --> 17:00.382
And we won!

17:00.452 --> 17:03.353
Thatjimmy fella
Certainly has a gal pal in faye.

17:03.421 --> 17:04.887
They make
A cute couple, huh?

17:04.955 --> 17:07.015
The only other band I was in
Was my uncle's band.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.117
We played this wedding for free,
And then we broke up.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.888
This one gets a paying gig.

17:10.962 --> 17:14.295
So, what are you
Doin' next weekend?

17:14.366 --> 17:15.526
Are you kidding?

17:15.599 --> 17:18.194
I'm gonna see my boyfriend's
Music group.

17:18.269 --> 17:20.099
Award-winning
Music group.

17:20.171 --> 17:22.435
Yeah, and you're playing
At a restaurant

17:22.507 --> 17:23.940
Out by the...airport?

17:24.008 --> 17:26.442
Villapiano's.

17:44.629 --> 17:48.656
And when i
Close my eyes

17:48.733 --> 17:53.033
You'll be
Right by my side

17:53.104 --> 17:57.837
If I could have
Just one request

17:57.909 --> 17:59.968
Stay with me, girl

18:00.044 --> 18:02.205
i confess

18:02.280 --> 18:10.551
All my lone...ly
Dreams

18:23.701 --> 18:24.827
Thank you.

18:27.305 --> 18:30.069
Table 19,
Your pizza's ready.

18:37.682 --> 18:39.775
Hey, when are you gonna play
That thing you do?

18:39.851 --> 18:41.478
That's what we
Wanna hear!

18:41.553 --> 18:43.384
Uh, has our fame
Preceded us?

18:43.455 --> 18:45.286
Hey, we came here
To meet giris and dance,

18:45.356 --> 18:47.221
And we can't meet giris
Until we dance!

18:47.292 --> 18:50.318
All right, this is an opportune time
To pick it up a little.

18:50.395 --> 18:53.592
All right, here's one
For the kid in the back.

18:54.966 --> 18:56.092
Let's dance!

18:58.870 --> 19:00.394
You

19:00.472 --> 19:03.498
Doin' that thing
You do

19:03.575 --> 19:09.411
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces

19:09.481 --> 19:11.142
Like you...

19:13.485 --> 19:15.612
Let it burn.
Let her burn.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.279
Let her burn all night.

19:17.355 --> 19:19.721
Bring me out here in the doggone
Middle of the night

19:19.791 --> 19:21.622
To turn off the light.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.593
Can't he ever
Get anything right?

19:23.661 --> 19:27.062
"Oh, no. No, dad,
I'll-i'll be sure
To turn the lights off."

19:27.131 --> 19:29.224
Hell, he couldn't
Turn a light off at the house.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.461
Why would he ever
Turn one off down here at the store?

19:35.173 --> 19:36.606
Know what that is?

19:37.976 --> 19:39.876
Presidential
Flash cards?

19:39.944 --> 19:41.468
A bonus.

19:41.546 --> 19:42.911
Do you know why?

19:42.981 --> 19:45.381
I have no idea.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.849
To entice you back.

19:46.918 --> 19:48.749
The word is out
On you o-neders.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.412
Hey,
That's o-nedders.

19:50.488 --> 19:52.422
The door went up
On your second set tonight.

19:52.490 --> 19:55.118
People were callin' their friends
To come down to villapiano's.

19:55.193 --> 19:56.160
Yeah?

19:56.227 --> 19:58.161
I'm gonna make
A fortune off you.

19:58.229 --> 20:01.323
I tell you- hey, don't even bother
With the fake i.d.s.

20:01.399 --> 20:03.299
Villapiano's is closed.
Lance! Lance.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.835
Like, so whatever
Happened to tina?

20:04.903 --> 20:06.894
Um, she had
To help her mom

20:06.971 --> 20:09.565
With a tupperware party,
Making food.

20:09.641 --> 20:12.610
Well, she better get herself
Down here next time,

20:12.677 --> 20:15.271
'Cause all the giris
Were talking about you guys

20:15.346 --> 20:16.335
In the bathroom.

20:16.414 --> 20:17.881
Yeah?

20:17.949 --> 20:19.610
I almost slugged some girl
Called chrissy.

20:19.684 --> 20:21.618
- chrissy thompkins?
- short brown hair.

20:21.686 --> 20:23.813
Wait. What did I miss?
Who is she?

20:23.888 --> 20:27.085
Oh, gray polka-dot dress,
Nursing a beer,

20:27.158 --> 20:28.420
Over by the photo-booth.

20:28.493 --> 20:29.619
Stayed for both sets.

20:29.694 --> 20:31.787
Wait. Where was I?

20:31.863 --> 20:33.797
Oh, playing songs
On my guitar.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.765
Here you go, kids.
On the house.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.460
She had her eye
On myjimmy.

20:37.535 --> 20:40.060
Hey, three stooges,
Come on, out.

20:40.138 --> 20:43.266
She had some fine things to say
About our drummer as well, though.

20:43.341 --> 20:45.935
- get out. What'd she say?
- I don't know.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.500
Hey, guys. I don't
Mean to interrupt.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.638
I just wanna say that,
Uh, love your song, love that music.

20:49.714 --> 20:51.147
I wanna know where I can
Get the record.

20:51.215 --> 20:52.443
- outside.
- hey, pops!

20:52.517 --> 20:54.451
Pops? I'll give you a pop.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.680
Hey, wasn't
That our fan?

20:58.856 --> 21:01.450
Hey, what do you guys
Think about that?

21:01.526 --> 21:02.720
what?

21:02.794 --> 21:04.785
Maybe we should
Make a record.

21:04.862 --> 21:06.591
Like, actually
Make a record.

21:06.664 --> 21:07.926
A record-record
Record?

21:07.999 --> 21:09.591
Yeah,
That's what I mean.

21:09.667 --> 21:11.032
Not one
That we'd play.

21:11.102 --> 21:12.831
Yeah, I mean, we could, like,
Sell copies of them right here

21:12.904 --> 21:14.132
For a buck apiece.

21:14.205 --> 21:16.969
There's a sound booth
At tele-mart that we could use.

21:17.041 --> 21:18.633
No, that's for,
Like, two people.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.177
That's for
Birthday greetings.

21:20.244 --> 21:21.609
You're talkin'
To spartacus here.

21:21.679 --> 21:24.944
I happen to have a relative
In the record industry.

21:25.016 --> 21:26.449
Ooh. Uncle bob?

21:26.517 --> 21:28.041
Uncle-
Who's uncle bob?

21:28.119 --> 21:30.849
He records church music.

21:30.922 --> 21:32.981
Choirs, favorite sermons,

21:33.057 --> 21:34.684
Stuff my mom listens to.

21:34.759 --> 21:36.852
So could he
Record our music?

21:36.928 --> 21:37.860
maybe.

21:37.929 --> 21:39.362
Wouldn't do it
For free.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.864
And we'd have to
Watch our language.

21:43.801 --> 21:45.359
Wah!

21:58.716 --> 22:00.479
'Cause we

22:00.551 --> 22:03.987
Could be happy,
Can't you see?

22:04.055 --> 22:09.687
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you

22:09.761 --> 22:13.197
And keep you here
With me

22:13.264 --> 22:16.927
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go

22:17.001 --> 22:20.232
Around with someone new

22:20.304 --> 22:24.104
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing

22:24.175 --> 22:27.611
Every day,
Just doin' that thing

22:27.679 --> 22:32.707
And I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do

22:39.957 --> 22:41.652
That was swingin', man!

22:41.726 --> 22:42.750
- swingin'?
- swingin'!

22:42.827 --> 22:44.454
That's good, right?
Swingin' is good?

22:44.529 --> 22:46.588
I think
It was still too fast.

22:46.664 --> 22:48.825
Thank you, uncle bob.
Thank you very, very much.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.527
Say hi
To your dad for me.

22:50.601 --> 22:51.693
You got it.

22:51.769 --> 22:53.634
Hey, what about
All my own dreams?

22:53.705 --> 22:56.799
I got to be in buffalo
At 7:00 to record a children's choir.

22:56.874 --> 22:59.069
I only got
That one take.

22:59.143 --> 23:02.806
Hey, uncle bob, when are we gonna
Get these records?

23:02.880 --> 23:05.371
Uh...

23:05.450 --> 23:07.213
Luke 21:19.

23:07.285 --> 23:09.879
"And your patience
Possess ye your souls."

23:11.289 --> 23:12.313
Luke? Who's luke?

23:12.390 --> 23:14.688
When are we
Gettin' the record?

23:14.759 --> 23:16.192
Wednesday.

23:18.029 --> 23:20.156
come on!
Come on!

23:20.231 --> 23:22.495
Hey, these are
The o-neders?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.660
No. It's the one-ders.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.567

Playing here tonight?

Thank you.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.606

You can see me from up there?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.272
Oh, crystal clearly.

23:37.348 --> 23:39.373
You've been here
Every night.

23:39.450 --> 23:42.112
You know, you guys
Are way better than anything.

23:42.186 --> 23:44.279
I told my parents I was going over
To my friends'-

23:44.355 --> 23:46.516
Bobbie and joanne-
To study, but I didn't.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.990
I came here, instead.

23:48.059 --> 23:50.425
I'm stooping to subterfuge
For you guys.

23:50.495 --> 23:51.723
Hoo hoo. Subter-

23:51.796 --> 23:52.820
Hey, uh, skitch,

23:52.897 --> 23:55.491
Your girlfriend
Just walked in the door.

23:57.235 --> 24:00.534
Oh, great.
Tina made it.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.129
I'll handle this.
Don't worry.

24:02.206 --> 24:03.195
Thanks.

24:03.274 --> 24:05.003
Hi. I'm lenny.

24:05.076 --> 24:06.065
Hi.

24:06.144 --> 24:07.839
What's your name?

24:07.912 --> 24:08.810
Chrissy.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.610

24:11.682 --> 24:12.876

And look.

Ah. You look great.

24:17.622 --> 24:20.614
Yeah, he's got a very
Pretty girlfriend, doesn't he?

24:20.691 --> 24:22.625
Is it serious,
Do you know?

24:22.693 --> 24:25.491
Very serious.
I'm single.

24:25.563 --> 24:27.258
What about
The bass player?

24:27.331 --> 24:29.196
He's married.

24:29.267 --> 24:31.201
Is it always
This smoky?

24:31.269 --> 24:32.964
Hey, ringo,
It's showtime.

24:33.037 --> 24:36.131
Come on, you should've
Been on five minutes ago.

24:48.119 --> 24:51.953
With them, I feel like
I'm wastin' my time

24:52.023 --> 24:55.550
And you make me feel
Like I'm losin' my mind

24:55.626 --> 24:59.722
Little wild

24:59.797 --> 25:00.889
Queen

25:01.966 --> 25:06.699
My little wild

25:06.771 --> 25:08.238

25:09.440 --> 25:12.932
Oh, I left
My girl, fine

25:13.010 --> 25:17.447
But then I need you
All the time

25:17.515 --> 25:18.982
Little wild one

25:19.050 --> 25:20.381
I'll come back

25:20.451 --> 25:21.713
I'll take one.

25:21.786 --> 25:23.515
Little wild one,
I'll come back

25:23.588 --> 25:25.579
Sellin' a lot of these?

25:25.656 --> 25:28.523
I'll come back

25:28.593 --> 25:29.992
Thank you.

25:30.061 --> 25:36.762

25:44.709 --> 25:48.110
Thank you, erie, p-a!

25:55.820 --> 25:57.549
Let me see that paper.

25:58.956 --> 26:01.823
Let's see what tele-mart's
Up to here today.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.453
Full page, of course.

26:04.528 --> 26:06.189
Oh, get this.

26:06.264 --> 26:08.494
Barbecue grills.
They got barbecue grills now.

26:08.566 --> 26:09.760
For 7.89.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.734
Good lord.

26:11.802 --> 26:13.292
Oh, here's-
Here's somethin'.

26:13.371 --> 26:14.861
Look here.

26:14.939 --> 26:16.770
Shoe-polisher kit.

26:16.841 --> 26:19.469
People can't even
Get a brush and a rag out

26:19.543 --> 26:20.874
And shine
Their shoes anymore.

26:20.945 --> 26:22.845
They gotta have
A shoe-polisher kit.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.211
Man, oh, man.

26:24.282 --> 26:27.308
" portable radio, 8.88.

26:27.385 --> 26:29.945
"Open saturday,
10:00-10:00.

26:30.021 --> 26:33.218
Sunday, 12:00-6:00."

26:33.291 --> 26:36.192
Open on sunday
From 12:00-6:00.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.285
You know, I don't believe
I wanna live in a country

26:38.362 --> 26:40.990
Where you have
To stay open on sunday

26:41.065 --> 26:42.191
To do business.

26:42.266 --> 26:43.995
You shouldn't have
To work on sunday

26:44.068 --> 26:45.501
To support a family,
Should you?

26:45.569 --> 26:46.536
No, no. Hmm?

26:46.604 --> 26:47.832
Let's put
That paper away.

26:47.905 --> 26:49.270
Let's just
Take that right now.

26:49.340 --> 26:50.807
Yeah, let's get it
Out of here.

26:50.875 --> 26:53.742
Ok, let's get to work. Guy,
Quit fiddling around with those records

26:53.811 --> 26:55.073
Up there in the window.

26:55.146 --> 26:58.115
We're not selling
Records here, are we? Are we, mama?

26:58.182 --> 27:00.082
This is an appliance store,
I believe.

27:00.151 --> 27:01.379
It's called
Patterson's appliances.

27:01.452 --> 27:03.386
Come on in. We're open.

27:05.323 --> 27:07.655
Can I help you?

27:07.725 --> 27:09.989
Y-you're the drummer,
Aren't ya?

27:10.061 --> 27:12.393
Of that group I heard
Last night, uh...

27:12.463 --> 27:14.192
Uh, uh,
Down at villapiano's.

27:14.265 --> 27:15.857
Yes, I am.

27:17.835 --> 27:19.325
Phil horace.

27:19.403 --> 27:20.893
Guy patterson.

27:23.507 --> 27:27.273
Do you wanna buy one of our records?
They're on sale.

27:27.345 --> 27:30.007
I don't wanna waste
Any more of your time.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.878
Would you step
Into my office, please?

27:35.519 --> 27:36.952
You know, guy...

27:37.021 --> 27:40.081
One of the good things about your group
Is there's a nice...

27:40.157 --> 27:42.591
Natural, raw quality.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.128
I like that.

27:45.196 --> 27:46.390
Thank you.

27:46.464 --> 27:48.932
And I wanna tell you,
I've been around.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.195
And I think this...

27:51.268 --> 27:52.997
Is a hit record.

27:54.438 --> 27:58.465
And I found that a hit record
Is like a stew.

27:58.542 --> 28:01.238
All the ingredients
Have to cook together just right.

28:01.312 --> 28:03.212
Otherwise, it's just soup.

28:05.116 --> 28:07.448
Not too early in the day
For one of these, I hope.

28:07.518 --> 28:08.450
I'm thirsty.

28:08.519 --> 28:10.544
I'm not sure about this.

28:10.621 --> 28:12.054
It's a standard
Management contract.

28:12.123 --> 28:15.024
It says if I do my job,
You guys make money.

28:15.092 --> 28:16.559
How do we make money?

28:16.627 --> 28:19.027
Yeah, how? You gonna wrangle us
Up some dances

28:19.096 --> 28:21.530
At roller rinks,
Youth for christ jamborees-

28:21.599 --> 28:26.400
Rock 'n' roll shows in steubenville,
Youngstown, pittsburgh,

28:26.470 --> 28:27.869
Places like that.

28:27.938 --> 28:30.372
- really?
- yeah.
- pittsburgh?

28:30.441 --> 28:31.373
Steubenville.

28:31.442 --> 28:33.307
Yeah.

28:33.377 --> 28:37.643
And how would you like to hear
That thing you do on the radio?

28:37.715 --> 28:38.909
I'd love to.

28:38.983 --> 28:40.541
Um, sure.

28:40.618 --> 28:42.586
Well, then,
Leave it to me.

28:42.653 --> 28:44.086
And here's your guarantee.

28:44.155 --> 28:46.055
If I don't get
This record going,

28:46.123 --> 28:47.818
And I mean serious radio airplay
Inside of a week-

28:47.892 --> 28:49.257
10 days at the most-

28:49.326 --> 28:50.759
We'll tear this up.

28:50.828 --> 28:53.661
I'm no longer your manager.

28:53.731 --> 28:55.164
I don't know.

28:55.232 --> 28:57.200
I'm reluctant
To sign anything

28:57.268 --> 29:00.101
That has to do
With my music.

29:00.171 --> 29:01.604
What, are you crazy?

29:01.672 --> 29:05.540
A man in a really nice camper
Wants to put our song on the radio.

29:05.609 --> 29:07.008
Give me a pen.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.842
I'm signing, you're signing,
We're all signing.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.075
Hey, do you have
Something to drink besides juice?

29:12.149 --> 29:15.209
Yeah, I think there's some
Soda pop under that blanket.

29:26.263 --> 29:28.060
The swelling will go down
In a couple of days.

29:28.132 --> 29:30.566
Put cold compresses,
20 minutes at a time, all right?

29:30.634 --> 29:32.568
I'll see you in
A couple of days.

29:32.636 --> 29:34.501
Your new patient,
Tina powers, is here.

29:37.141 --> 29:39.166
Hi, are you tina?

29:45.683 --> 29:47.617
Tina? Yes.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.482
Yes, I'm tina.

30:04.701 --> 30:07.261
You see those ladies
Over by the stove?

30:09.672 --> 30:12.607
Get that thing
Out of your ear and get over here.

30:12.675 --> 30:15.143
And put the hamburger away.
You can eat anytime.

30:15.211 --> 30:16.269
Come on!

30:18.181 --> 30:19.443

30:32.762 --> 30:34.696
A local erie band's
Got a new record out.

30:34.764 --> 30:36.698
Just won the mercyhurst
Talent show a couple of weeks ago.

30:36.766 --> 30:39.098
This is erie's own...

30:39.168 --> 30:40.601
Oh, my god!

30:41.671 --> 30:43.605

30:43.673 --> 30:47.404
Doin' that thing
You do

30:47.477 --> 30:51.345
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces

30:56.452 --> 30:58.784
Aah! We're
On the radio!

30:58.855 --> 31:01.255
The radio's playing
That thing you do!

31:01.324 --> 31:03.053

31:07.230 --> 31:10.597

31:10.666 --> 31:12.964

Classic white,

31:22.678 --> 31:25.772
Guy! Turn on the radio!
They're playing it!

31:35.057 --> 31:36.490
Ok. Turn it on.

31:38.895 --> 31:43.161
'Cause I try and try
To forget you

31:43.232 --> 31:47.100
But it's just
So hard to do

31:47.170 --> 31:49.138
Every time

31:49.205 --> 31:52.538
Son, you wanna get your
Cotton-pickin' mitts off that!

31:52.608 --> 31:54.872
Yeah!

31:54.944 --> 31:57.640

31:57.713 --> 32:01.149

For sure

32:19.302 --> 32:21.770

Huh? Yeah.

32:28.377 --> 32:30.902
Yes! We're on the radio!

32:44.794 --> 32:49.390
Put that down.
That is a very expensive floor display.

32:49.465 --> 32:51.126
Patterson's appliances.

32:52.101 --> 32:53.068

32:53.135 --> 32:56.070

I missed it.

33:10.419 --> 33:14.981
Well, it played 3 times...
This afternoon.

33:15.057 --> 33:16.354

Heard your song, guy.

Who's gonna hit me?

35:51.447 --> 35:52.414
- hit me!
- hit me!

35:52.481 --> 35:54.381
All right! Let's go!

35:54.450 --> 35:57.146
We gotjon d
And the walkers.

35:57.219 --> 35:58.618
We got the hollyhocks.

35:58.687 --> 36:03.147
We got the vicksburgs
In pittsburgh.

36:03.225 --> 36:06.661
But first it's time to fix that solid
Not broken heart

36:06.729 --> 36:08.594
If we're gonna shake, bake,
And make

36:08.664 --> 36:13.761
With lake erie's own...
The o-neders.

36:20.843 --> 36:24.108
Fire one up. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

36:25.314 --> 36:27.578
Thank you.

36:27.649 --> 36:29.048
Hey, hey!

36:29.118 --> 36:30.608
The mike's not on.

36:30.686 --> 36:32.677
We-the mike's
Not working.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.188
The mike's not working.

36:34.256 --> 36:35.917
All right. Who am I not paying
Back here? Come on.

36:35.991 --> 36:37.356
let's here it.
Come on!

36:40.996 --> 36:43.965
come on!

36:51.907 --> 36:52.839
Thank you.

36:52.908 --> 36:54.000
Thank you.

36:54.076 --> 36:55.543
We're the one-ders.

36:55.611 --> 36:58.011
Would you play some
Friggin' music? Come on!

36:58.080 --> 36:59.104
All right.

36:59.181 --> 37:00.239
1...

37:00.315 --> 37:01.714
2...

37:07.623 --> 37:10.717
Forget it.
Let's go. Let's go.

37:11.627 --> 37:12.753
Let's go.

37:12.828 --> 37:14.159
Right now!

37:23.772 --> 37:26.206
Look, guy,
I keep telling ya.

37:26.275 --> 37:27.674
You are the drummer.

37:27.743 --> 37:29.176
You're the backbone,
The timekeeper.

37:29.244 --> 37:32.702
You can't let a tepid reaction
From one matinee house

37:32.781 --> 37:35.181
Affect your dedication
To the band.

37:35.250 --> 37:38.686
I was playing like one of those
Wind-up monkey toys.

37:38.754 --> 37:40.688
They booed us
Off the stage.

37:40.756 --> 37:43.691
Jimmy couldn't even hear
How off-key he was.

37:43.759 --> 37:45.317
You're gonna get it all back tonight,
I promise you.

37:45.394 --> 37:47.362
You know what you need?

37:47.429 --> 37:50.364
You need to sample
The exotic cuisine of the far east.

37:50.432 --> 37:52.900
What do you say?
Come on. I'm buying.

37:59.775 --> 38:02.801
Well, son of a gun.
We're right on time.

38:02.878 --> 38:04.812
Here's somebody
I want you to meet.

38:06.815 --> 38:09.511
Mr. White...

38:09.585 --> 38:10.552
This is guy patterson.

38:10.619 --> 38:11.551
Hi.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.951
Sit down.

38:13.021 --> 38:16.354
Mr. White is with
Play-tone records.

38:16.425 --> 38:18.825
He just happened to be
In town this week,

38:18.894 --> 38:21.328
And he caught the show
This afternoon.

38:21.396 --> 38:22.294
Oh, great.

38:22.364 --> 38:23.388
Nevertheless,

38:23.465 --> 38:26.798
I think he wants to talk
Business with you.

38:28.136 --> 38:31.196
Well, I have heard
Your record, guy, and I like it.

38:31.273 --> 38:32.706
I like it a lot.

38:32.774 --> 38:35.174
That thing you do,
You know, it's snappy.

38:35.244 --> 38:36.211
Yeah, snappy.

38:36.278 --> 38:37.711
It's a hit record.

38:37.779 --> 38:40.247
We'd like to release it.

38:40.315 --> 38:42.579
And add the one-ders...

38:42.651 --> 38:45.381
To the play-tone stable
Of artists.

38:52.494 --> 38:54.189
Just like that.

38:55.330 --> 38:57.764
Well, some papers
Will have to be signed,

38:57.833 --> 39:00.802
And you'll have to get me
The master recording tapes,

39:00.869 --> 39:04.703
And you will have to say
Good-bye to phil here.

39:04.773 --> 39:06.741
Wait. No.
Phil's our manager.

39:06.808 --> 39:07.740
Not anymore.

39:07.809 --> 39:10.209
My bird-dogging is done.

39:10.279 --> 39:12.713
Play-tone's gonna take
Real good care of you.

39:12.781 --> 39:16.182
Uh, what if we don't
Wanna be with play-tone?

39:16.251 --> 39:19.584
I don't know, no offense.

39:19.655 --> 39:21.054
None taken.

39:21.123 --> 39:22.556
You want to stay
In pittsburgh

39:22.624 --> 39:24.558
And play to the
Three rivers crowd,

39:24.626 --> 39:26.059
Phil here
Is your man.

39:26.128 --> 39:27.459
No, no.
Wait a minute.

39:27.529 --> 39:29.463
Wait a minute.

39:29.531 --> 39:30.964
Guy...

39:31.033 --> 39:34.901
Play-tone has a show
Touring state fairs.

39:34.970 --> 39:37.404
This is the big time.
The full bore.

39:37.472 --> 39:39.440
This is
A rock 'n' roll tour

39:39.508 --> 39:40.941
That will feature
The one-ders

39:41.009 --> 39:43.603
Provided you quit sitting
On your brain.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.671
We'd be on tour?

39:46.748 --> 39:47.840
Yeah!

39:47.916 --> 39:49.611
A tour?

39:49.685 --> 39:53.644
With other stars
Of the play-tone galaxy.

39:56.692 --> 39:59.092
I have to talk this over
With the rest of the band.

40:01.964 --> 40:03.397
See what I mean?

40:03.465 --> 40:04.864
Smart.

40:04.933 --> 40:07.060
Very good.

40:07.135 --> 40:11.299
Next...this one-ders
With the o-n-e...

40:11.373 --> 40:12.499
It doesn't work.

40:12.574 --> 40:13.802
It's confusing.

40:13.875 --> 40:16.810
From now on you boys
Will just be simply the wonders.

40:16.878 --> 40:20.279
As in I wonder what happened
To the o-neders?

40:20.349 --> 40:21.407
That's right.

40:21.483 --> 40:23.576
Play-tone will release
The record nationally,

40:23.652 --> 40:26.212
But you'll be doing
An awful lot of promoting as we go,

40:26.288 --> 40:27.619
So be prepared.

40:27.689 --> 40:29.486
All my only dreams
Is on the " b" side?

40:29.558 --> 40:30.786
Mm-hmm.

40:30.859 --> 40:33.657
We only got one take of that
When we did that in church.

40:33.729 --> 40:35.128
Could we re-record that?

40:35.197 --> 40:38.132
I don't think so.
I think it's great just the way it is.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.134
We are gonna get you
Some new clothes.

40:40.202 --> 40:41.635
Matching suits,
Nice suits.

40:41.703 --> 40:43.671
Nice, because
You are nice boys.

40:43.739 --> 40:45.138
Except maybe
For you.

40:45.207 --> 40:48.142
So when do we cut
Our next record?

40:48.210 --> 40:51.145
Touring is the priority,
Um,jimmy.

40:51.213 --> 40:54.148
We're gonna meet up with the rest
Of the play-tone gang

40:54.216 --> 40:56.684
In columbus as soon
As possible.

40:56.752 --> 40:59.550
You'll be out on the road with them
Until labor day.

40:59.621 --> 41:00.645
Not me.

41:02.190 --> 41:03.714
Is this a mutiny
Already?

41:03.792 --> 41:06.420
No, see, um...

41:07.663 --> 41:10.097
Well, I joined the united states
Marine corps

41:10.165 --> 41:11.598
Back at home.
So, um...

41:11.667 --> 41:14.602
I have to report to south carolina
At the end of august,

41:14.670 --> 41:17.104
Which means I have
To leave the band

41:17.172 --> 41:18.935
At the end of august.

41:21.209 --> 41:25.612
But you will stay with the band
Until the end of august?

41:25.681 --> 41:27.672
Yes, sir.

41:28.850 --> 41:35.050
Ok, next, uh...
Who is faye?

41:37.659 --> 41:38.591
Uh...

41:39.695 --> 41:42.994
Faye's sort of, uh,
Like my girlfriend.

41:43.065 --> 41:45.033
Oh, that is
So sweet.

41:45.100 --> 41:46.499
You want her
On tour?

41:46.568 --> 41:47.899
She's your
Costume mistress.

41:47.969 --> 41:52.133
All right, boys, do better tonight
Than you did today.

41:52.207 --> 41:54.641
I'm gonna go up
And have a chat

41:54.710 --> 41:56.143
With boss vic
Kosslovitch,

41:56.211 --> 41:58.179
Make sure your mikes work
This time.

41:58.246 --> 41:59.304
Ah! Guy...

42:01.616 --> 42:03.743
See what the worid looks
Like through those.

42:03.819 --> 42:04.877
And you...

42:13.361 --> 42:16.262
Percussionist foster grant.

42:16.331 --> 42:18.765
Well, you're an adult,
So go on.

42:18.834 --> 42:20.768
Go on off then and bang
On your bongo drums as long as you like.

42:20.836 --> 42:22.770
It's for the summer, dad.
I'll drop you a line.

42:22.838 --> 42:24.806
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah. You do that.

42:24.873 --> 42:26.306
Tell mom I love her.

42:26.374 --> 42:27.773
I'll tell her.

42:29.478 --> 42:30.467
Well, mama,

42:30.545 --> 42:31.978
Your son
Who loves you

42:32.047 --> 42:33.981
Just left us
In the lurch.

42:34.049 --> 42:36.017
Darlene, you just
Got promoted.

42:36.084 --> 42:38.018
You mean, you're gonna
Start paying me?

42:38.086 --> 42:39.348
I didn't say that.

42:39.421 --> 42:41.855
Oh, hi, folks.
How're you doing today?

42:48.230 --> 42:50.790
Hey, isn't it about time
You got going?

42:54.970 --> 42:57.939
Special moment
For any recording artist.

42:58.006 --> 42:59.166
It's our record!

42:59.241 --> 43:00.173
Wow!

43:00.242 --> 43:01.937
Wow.

43:02.010 --> 43:03.307
Wow, wow, wow!

43:03.378 --> 43:05.812
Ooh! It's got a hole in it.

43:05.881 --> 43:07.815
It's got grooves.
It's a play-tone record!

43:07.883 --> 43:10.010
Hey, you're missing somebody, guy.
Where's your bass player?

43:10.085 --> 43:13.077
Oh, he went sniffing around
The chantrellines' bus.

43:13.155 --> 43:14.952
Guess he's trying
To get a glimpse.

43:15.023 --> 43:17.491
A big crush
On them sirens.

43:18.894 --> 43:20.555
Diane dane!
Diane dane!

43:20.629 --> 43:22.028
We love you.

43:22.097 --> 43:24.565
I had my first
Boy-girl thing.

43:24.633 --> 43:28.000
It was for a picture
Of you on a record sleeve.

43:28.069 --> 43:29.036
Yeah, charming.

43:29.104 --> 43:30.002
Excuse me.

43:30.071 --> 43:31.800
Diane dane!

43:31.873 --> 43:35.274
Really, honestly,
You were very important to me.

43:37.712 --> 43:39.145
You the wonders?

43:39.214 --> 43:40.112
We sure are.

43:40.182 --> 43:41.615
And you're freddy
Fredrickson.

43:41.683 --> 43:43.082
Aw, this is
Too much.

43:43.151 --> 43:45.642
I heard your tune in sound check.
It's catchy, man.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.652
Thanks.

43:46.721 --> 43:48.655
First record
I ever bought

43:48.723 --> 43:50.691
Was theme from mr. Downtown.

43:50.759 --> 43:54.286
Darkness falls,
And the night's begun

43:54.362 --> 43:55.795
Wow. You sing
Better than I do.

43:55.864 --> 43:57.832
The river of lights
As bright as the sun

43:57.899 --> 43:59.799
Ok. I'll see you
Out there.

43:59.868 --> 44:01.233
Under the waning moon

44:01.303 --> 44:05.569
There's danger
To be found

44:05.640 --> 44:09.974
For the man with the badge
In the night

44:10.045 --> 44:12.775
The man with the badge
In the night

44:12.848 --> 44:13.940
What's his name?

44:14.015 --> 44:18.076
Mr. Downtown

44:18.153 --> 44:21.816
Mr. Downtown

44:21.890 --> 44:25.917
Mr. Downtown

44:25.994 --> 44:28.986
Mr. Downtown

44:29.064 --> 44:31.658
Oh, you can't
Run away

44:31.733 --> 44:33.826
No, you can't run away

44:33.902 --> 44:37.633
When you're walking
Along with me

44:37.706 --> 44:39.105
Guy, where are
Your sunglasses?

44:39.174 --> 44:41.608
Where're your sunglasses?
Faye! Faye!

44:41.676 --> 44:42.665
yeah?

44:42.744 --> 44:44.609
Find guy's glasses,
His sunglasses, quick!

44:44.679 --> 44:48.615
The portly gentleman
Sniffing his stogy is k.o. Bailey.

44:48.683 --> 44:52.210
He's columbus' second most popular
Disc jockey.

44:52.287 --> 44:54.687
Well, he's the biggest
Cootie I ever saw.

44:54.756 --> 44:56.690
If he likes
What he hears,

44:56.758 --> 45:00.194
He's gonna play that thing you do
Tomorrow morning

45:00.262 --> 45:02.127
With 50,000 watts
Behind it.

45:02.197 --> 45:04.631
It's very important
You don't stink today.

45:04.699 --> 45:06.166
Hey, I make
No guarantees.

45:06.234 --> 45:07.633
We bow, right?
In unison.

45:07.702 --> 45:10.637
And we're off the stage
Before the applause dies out, right?

45:10.705 --> 45:12.138
What if they
Want an encore?

45:12.207 --> 45:14.675
You unplug and you run,
Run off stage...

45:14.743 --> 45:16.176
Smiling,
Smiling of course.

45:16.244 --> 45:17.677
Here you go. Here.

45:17.746 --> 45:19.646
No encores! Guy,
Keep these with you.

45:19.714 --> 45:21.682
Put 'em on. Put 'em on.
There you go.

45:21.750 --> 45:24.150
From now on, you have them with you
Day and night.

45:24.219 --> 45:25.413
They're your trademark.

45:25.487 --> 45:27.421
You look good in 'em.

45:27.489 --> 45:29.423
You guys look great
In red.

45:29.491 --> 45:31.925
Have I told you that, yet?
You have your pick?

45:31.993 --> 45:32.960
Right here.

45:33.028 --> 45:33.960
Downtown

45:34.029 --> 45:35.963
All right, this is it.

45:36.031 --> 45:38.431
If the crowd doesn't
Go wild for you,

45:38.500 --> 45:39.933
Don't worry about it.

45:40.001 --> 45:41.468
They will tomorrow.

45:41.536 --> 45:42.969
Thank you, ohio.

45:43.038 --> 45:44.938
All right. Timing is everything
On the entrance.

45:45.006 --> 45:46.940
Fix his jacket so it
Doesn't pouf up behind.

45:47.008 --> 45:48.441
Let's give
A big welcome

45:48.510 --> 45:49.977
To the latest
Addition

45:50.045 --> 45:51.603
To the play-tone
Galaxy of stars.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.113
That's it.
Go, go, go, go!

45:53.181 --> 45:54.648
Let's watch. Come on.

45:54.716 --> 45:55.614
The wonders!

45:55.684 --> 45:57.311
There you are.
Right here.

46:00.989 --> 46:03.719
Well, take us there,
Skitch.

46:14.502 --> 46:16.129
You

46:16.204 --> 46:19.367
Doin' that thing
You do

46:19.441 --> 46:25.380
Breakin' my heart
Into a million pieces

46:25.447 --> 46:28.746
Like you always do

46:28.817 --> 46:30.978
And you

46:31.052 --> 46:33.885
Don't mean to be cruel

46:33.955 --> 46:37.083
You never even knew

46:37.158 --> 46:39.626
About the heartache

46:39.694 --> 46:42.822
I've been
Goin' through

46:42.897 --> 46:46.298
Well, I try and try
To forget you, girl

46:46.368 --> 46:50.464
But it's just
So hard to do

46:50.538 --> 46:55.100
If I know you, you're
Doin' that thing you do

46:55.176 --> 46:56.939
Look at 93.

This latest record.

48:43.183 --> 48:44.616
It's our first record.

48:44.684 --> 48:47.585
We wrote it in my garage
In erie, pennsylvania.

48:47.654 --> 48:50.088

The kids and fellas here

48:50.156 --> 48:52.590
And all the folks
At the fair

48:52.659 --> 48:55.127

48:55.195 --> 48:57.595
Oh, I'm not here

At the livestock pavilion,

Some stuff.

You're the bobby washington.

52:20.667 --> 52:21.599
Yeah.

52:21.668 --> 52:23.101
You recorded
With del paxton

52:23.169 --> 52:25.137
On live at the philadelphia
Jazzjunction.

52:25.205 --> 52:26.433
I got that record.

52:26.506 --> 52:27.939
That's me
On the drums, man.

52:28.007 --> 52:29.531
What was it like to record
With del paxton?

52:29.609 --> 52:33.067
Miss dane, hi. I'm james mattingly
From the wonders.

52:33.146 --> 52:35.637
Oh, yes. Hi.
Nice to see you.

52:35.715 --> 52:37.649
Did you know we became 21
In billboard?

52:37.717 --> 52:42.677
Faye, what is jimmy doing
At diane dane's table?

52:42.755 --> 52:46.691
He's showing her how the record made
Number 21 in billboard.

52:46.759 --> 52:49.421
A record actually
Climbing the charts.

52:49.495 --> 52:51.395
She'll be chartreuse
With envy.

52:51.464 --> 52:54.126
I'll have another one of these
With no straw.

52:54.200 --> 52:55.132
Yes, sir.

52:55.201 --> 52:57.169
I've played
A lot of cards.

52:57.237 --> 52:59.296
Obviously.

53:00.740 --> 53:02.105
See my deck?

53:02.175 --> 53:04.234
See? You gotta be quick.

53:05.178 --> 53:07.009
You gotta be quick
With me.

53:07.080 --> 53:08.274
I'm from erie, p-a.

53:08.348 --> 53:09.440
Cheers.

53:10.984 --> 53:12.952
Tell me something, faye.

53:13.019 --> 53:17.115
How long have you and jimmy
Been you and jimmy?

53:19.525 --> 53:21.152
21/2 years.

53:21.227 --> 53:24.890
Whew. Now, that is
A long time.

53:26.666 --> 53:28.600
He's amazing.

53:28.668 --> 53:30.499
Amazing.

53:31.671 --> 53:33.104
He is.
He's amazing.

53:33.172 --> 53:34.696
Now, what about
Guy there?

53:34.774 --> 53:37.208
Does anybody at home
Think he's amazing?

53:37.277 --> 53:40.041
Well, he had a girlfriend
Back in erie.

53:40.113 --> 53:43.105
Um, tina. I met her
A couple of times.

53:43.182 --> 53:45.150
She fell in love
With her dentist.

53:45.218 --> 53:46.617
Now, that's too bad.

53:46.686 --> 53:47.653
Yeah.

53:47.720 --> 53:50.621
Let's try maybe these.

53:50.690 --> 53:51.622
Thinner frames.

53:51.691 --> 53:52.623
Ok.

53:52.692 --> 53:55.126
Take those off.
Put these on.

53:55.194 --> 53:57.662
Ok, look at me, guy.
Look at me.

53:57.730 --> 53:59.129
These are hip?

53:59.198 --> 54:01.063
No. Something else.
Try these on.

54:01.134 --> 54:02.567
Hide your cards.
Sit down.

54:02.635 --> 54:06.594
Watch these guys.
They're musicians. They cheat.

54:06.673 --> 54:08.607
So, we're gonna play
The 8,jack...

54:08.675 --> 54:10.575
Your worid goes on

54:10.643 --> 54:14.841
But for me,
My worid is over

54:14.914 --> 54:18.543
Don't know where
I'm gonna go now

54:18.618 --> 54:22.418
But I got to move on
Somehow

54:22.488 --> 54:25.252
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Whoa, whoa

54:40.673 --> 54:45.076
It hurts me so badly,
Deep down inside

54:45.144 --> 54:48.636
When I think about
All of your lies

54:48.715 --> 54:50.376
Oh

54:50.450 --> 54:52.645
Your worid goes on

54:52.719 --> 54:57.486
But for me,
My worid is over

54:57.557 --> 54:58.990
You fellas look
Great in gold.

54:59.058 --> 55:00.491
Have I told you
That?

55:00.560 --> 55:02.460
You straight on
Those harmonies now?

55:02.528 --> 55:03.426
Check.

55:04.497 --> 55:06.431
Now, you boys have fun.

55:06.499 --> 55:09.263
I think this is loose.
What is this?

55:09.335 --> 55:12.031
That was diane dane.

55:13.806 --> 55:15.239
There she is.

55:15.308 --> 55:18.766
Diane dane.
Look at that dress, huh?

55:18.845 --> 55:21.075
That's a-
That's a gold dress,

55:21.147 --> 55:22.705
Like a wisconsin sunrise.

55:22.782 --> 55:24.716
Get out of my way.

55:24.784 --> 55:26.217
This next group...

55:26.285 --> 55:27.183
Excellent.

55:27.253 --> 55:28.447
You've all been
Waiting for...

55:28.521 --> 55:29.920
Here they are...

55:29.989 --> 55:33.083
Playing that thing that's
Racing up the charts...

55:34.527 --> 55:35.926
Look out, wisconsin,

55:35.995 --> 55:38.429
It's...the wonders!

55:53.579 --> 55:55.479
'Cause we

55:55.548 --> 55:58.574
Would be happy,
Can't you see?

55:58.651 --> 56:04.146
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you

56:04.223 --> 56:08.023
And keep you here
With me

56:08.094 --> 56:11.393
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go

56:11.464 --> 56:14.592
Around with someone new

56:14.667 --> 56:19.036
And if I know you,
You're doin' that thing

56:19.105 --> 56:22.097
Every day,
Just doin' that thing

56:22.175 --> 56:26.976
And I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do

56:37.957 --> 56:39.288
Why do we have
To stand on stage

56:39.359 --> 56:40.951
With those other acts at the end
Of the show?

56:41.027 --> 56:43.757
Because we're members of the play-tone
Galaxy of stars.

56:43.830 --> 56:45.297
Did you see
The cast of bonanza

56:45.365 --> 56:46.764
Signing autographs
This afternoon?

56:46.833 --> 56:49.927
I shook hoss' hand.
He had his gun on and everything.

56:50.003 --> 56:51.834
Next weekend:
The beverly hillbillies.

56:51.905 --> 56:53.133
Ah, miss elly may.

56:53.206 --> 56:55.970
Miss elly may go skinny-dippin'
In the cee-ment pond.

56:56.042 --> 56:57.509
Elly may.
I love her.

56:57.577 --> 56:59.568
Inside, inside. Come on.

56:59.646 --> 57:00.738
Change of plans.

57:00.813 --> 57:03.304
We are leaving here
Just as soon as possible.

57:03.383 --> 57:06.147
That thing you do
Is the fastest-rising single

57:06.219 --> 57:08.813
In the history of
The play-tone label.

57:08.888 --> 57:10.822
As of tomorrow morning,
You wonders-

57:10.890 --> 57:13.688
You've got the number 7 record
In the country.

57:13.760 --> 57:14.658
Aah!

57:14.727 --> 57:17.321
- oh, my god!
- ohh!

57:17.397 --> 57:18.989
Ha ha ha!

57:21.267 --> 57:23.326
Watch the shelf.

57:23.403 --> 57:25.871
Look, state fairs
Are small potatoes.

57:25.939 --> 57:28.874
We are on a plane,
Flying to the coast...

57:28.942 --> 57:31.672
As long as we make
The airport on time.

57:31.744 --> 57:32.733
- to california?

57:32.812 --> 57:34.074
That's right.
California.

57:34.147 --> 57:36.081
number 7 this week.
Number 1 next week.

57:36.149 --> 57:37.673
If we become
Number one,

57:37.750 --> 57:40.116
Does that mean
We get a gold record?

57:40.186 --> 57:42.620
500,000 copies
For a gold.

57:47.293 --> 57:49.318
Heyyyyy!

57:52.131 --> 57:53.894
Put your glasses
On, shades.

57:53.967 --> 57:55.559
Give 'em
What they want.

57:55.635 --> 57:56.727
Ha ha!
Shades.

57:59.272 --> 58:00.534
The horses
Are coming.

58:00.606 --> 58:02.870
Where's the limo?

58:02.942 --> 58:04.671
All right, men,
Let's go!

58:04.744 --> 58:06.609
Ha ha!

58:10.717 --> 58:11.809

58:12.885 --> 58:15.115
No, wait.

58:15.188 --> 58:19.557
Ladies, climb on top
Of the car with us!

58:21.060 --> 58:22.925
Hey, hold it!

58:40.146 --> 58:41.636
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

58:52.525 --> 58:54.652
Hey, fancy
Meeting you here.

58:55.695 --> 58:57.629
That does not
Sound good.

58:57.697 --> 58:58.789
You feeling ok?

58:58.865 --> 59:01.459
No.

59:01.534 --> 59:02.466
No?

59:02.535 --> 59:04.332
It's cold in here,
Isn't it?

59:04.404 --> 59:06.133
No, you've
Got a fever.

59:06.205 --> 59:08.969
You're warm.
Here, lie down.

59:12.745 --> 59:14.679
Just gotta
Bundle you up.

59:14.747 --> 59:16.806
Skitch, band meeting
With herr play-tone.

59:16.883 --> 59:17.975
Ok.

59:20.420 --> 59:22.650
There you are.

59:22.722 --> 59:25.156
Now, sleep. No talking.

59:25.224 --> 59:27.522
We're winging our way
To the coast.

59:27.593 --> 59:29.891
Mmm, california.

59:29.962 --> 59:31.554
Here we come.

59:34.267 --> 59:36.326
You know, faye's
Not feeling very good.

59:36.402 --> 59:39.235
I wanna know when we'll get
Into a recording studio.

59:39.305 --> 59:41.136
First things first,
Fellas.

59:41.207 --> 59:43.539
You have to go off
And pay homage

59:43.609 --> 59:44.871
To mr. Sol siler.

59:44.944 --> 59:47.742
He's the founder and chairman
Of play-tone records.

59:47.814 --> 59:49.611
What hotel are
We staying at?

59:49.682 --> 59:51.650
It's the place
Lucy and ricky stayed

59:51.717 --> 59:53.742
When they came out
With fred and ethel.

59:53.820 --> 59:55.981
And then we go
Into the studio?

59:56.055 --> 59:56.953
Exactly.

59:57.023 --> 59:58.786
'Cause the point
Of all this

59:58.858 --> 01:00:00.450
Is to make
More records.

01:00:00.526 --> 01:00:02.153
What would you fellas
Think about

01:00:02.228 --> 01:00:05.129
Making an appearance in
A major motion picture?

01:00:05.198 --> 01:00:06.790
Whoa-ho-ho!
What movie?

01:00:06.866 --> 01:00:09.835
Then, something
Very grand on the horizon,

01:00:09.902 --> 01:00:12.132
If I have worked
The phones correctly-

01:00:12.205 --> 01:00:15.663
The hollywood
TelevisiÃ³n showcase.

01:00:15.741 --> 01:00:16.799
Hmm?

01:00:16.876 --> 01:00:19.003
we are gonna
Be on tv.

01:00:19.078 --> 01:00:20.477
Man!

01:00:20.546 --> 01:00:22.173
Then after that,
Sometime,

01:00:22.248 --> 01:00:24.341
Discmaster studios
On sunset...

01:00:24.417 --> 01:00:26.009
We cut another record.

01:00:26.085 --> 01:00:27.484
Any questions,
Don't ask.

01:00:27.553 --> 01:00:29.180
I'm tired
Of talking to you,

01:00:29.255 --> 01:00:31.314
And I want to sleep.

01:00:34.727 --> 01:00:37.195
Lenny, give me
That paper.

01:00:37.263 --> 01:00:38.753
Give me the paper.

01:00:44.337 --> 01:00:47.773
Lenny, why don't you
Go and see if you can
Visit the cockpit?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.604
Tell them it's your birthday.
Go, go, go.

01:01:12.231 --> 01:01:13.129
Hey, rose.

01:01:13.199 --> 01:01:14.166
Hi, lamarr.

01:01:14.233 --> 01:01:16.133
I don't have any cash.

01:01:16.202 --> 01:01:19.137
Well, then charge it
To your room, cherie.

01:01:19.205 --> 01:01:20.331
2242.

01:01:20.406 --> 01:01:21.464
Excuse me.

01:01:21.541 --> 01:01:23.975
Ooh. And I'll send you up
Some soup, too.

01:01:24.043 --> 01:01:25.010
Oh, thank you.

01:01:25.077 --> 01:01:26.977
My name is lamarr,
And this is my hotel,

01:01:27.046 --> 01:01:28.604
And we take care
Of people here.

01:01:28.681 --> 01:01:29.875
I'm faye.

01:01:29.949 --> 01:01:32.315
Didn't I check you
In with a quartet of gentlemen?

01:01:32.385 --> 01:01:35.650
And why aren't they here to take care
Of your needs?

01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:38.485
They're off making
A major motion picture.

01:01:38.558 --> 01:01:42.324
Oh, we got movie stars
In my hotel.

01:01:42.395 --> 01:01:44.625
They're musicians,
Actually.

01:01:44.697 --> 01:01:45.789
Even better.

01:01:49.835 --> 01:01:52.770
Whoo!

01:02:20.132 --> 01:02:21.724
rick! Anita!

01:02:21.801 --> 01:02:23.029
The music stopped.

01:02:23.102 --> 01:02:24.626
Yeah. Keep playing.

01:02:25.871 --> 01:02:28.465
All right, anita,
I get the message.

01:02:28.541 --> 01:02:31.135
It's about time
You noticed, rick.

01:02:32.211 --> 01:02:33.143
Thanks, goofball.

01:02:33.212 --> 01:02:35.476
Sure thing,
Anita sweetheart.

01:02:35.548 --> 01:02:37.243
keep dancing, goofball.

01:02:38.317 --> 01:02:40.012
Now look out
At the ocean.

01:02:40.086 --> 01:02:41.018
Say the line.

01:02:41.087 --> 01:02:43.055
We're being
Invaded!

01:02:43.122 --> 01:02:44.384
Run out of
The shot!

01:02:44.457 --> 01:02:45.424
Playback!

01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:46.549
Playback!

01:02:57.937 --> 01:02:59.598
- cut!
- cut! Cut! Cut!

01:02:59.672 --> 01:03:01.537
Print it!
Excellent!

01:03:01.607 --> 01:03:03.541
Hey, guys,
Boots randolph!

01:03:05.011 --> 01:03:05.978
Yeah!

01:03:06.045 --> 01:03:08.309
We look like a bunch
Of chimpanzees.

01:03:08.381 --> 01:03:10.349
No. We look like
A rock 'n' roll band

01:03:10.416 --> 01:03:11.713
Playing
A rock 'n' roll song

01:03:11.784 --> 01:03:13.342
During weekend at party pier.

01:03:13.419 --> 01:03:15.114
We're not the wonders
Right now.

01:03:15.187 --> 01:03:18.350
We're cap'n geech and
The shrimp shack shooters.

01:03:18.424 --> 01:03:19.516
Hey, good news,
Fellas.

01:03:19.592 --> 01:03:21.526
You get to keep
Your wardrobe.

01:03:21.594 --> 01:03:23.221
Ha ha ha!

01:03:24.463 --> 01:03:27.057
Hey, do we have
A top-10 record?

01:03:27.133 --> 01:03:28.191
You sure do.

01:03:28.267 --> 01:03:30.258
Then we shouldn't
Be here.

01:03:30.336 --> 01:03:33.305
Would you rather be back
On that state fair tour?

01:03:33.372 --> 01:03:35.135
They're playing
North dakota this week.

01:03:35.207 --> 01:03:37.903
No, no, no.
I vote for weekend at party pier.

01:03:37.977 --> 01:03:39.274
Smart man.

01:03:39.345 --> 01:03:43.213
You should have told us about this
Rick and anita movie.

01:03:43.282 --> 01:03:47.241
So mark that date-
Saturday and sunday,
August 20th and 21 st,

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.753
Pacific car showroom.

01:03:48.821 --> 01:03:51.255
Just look for the kmpc
Hit caravan and me.

01:03:51.324 --> 01:03:53.053
I'll be out there
Signing autographs.

01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:57.118
If you want a picture of me
In my official dodge boys
Rally team windbreaker,

01:03:57.196 --> 01:03:58.925
Well, then i
Just might oblige.

01:03:58.998 --> 01:04:02.263
But hey! I got some exciting guests
On my show today.

01:04:02.335 --> 01:04:05.065
Makers of a hit record,
Visitors from the east-

01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:07.765
Oops! Hold on, giris.
Not those mop-tops.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.774
Ha ha ha.
No, I'm talking

01:04:09.842 --> 01:04:12.640
About america's own
Wonderful...wonders!

01:04:12.712 --> 01:04:13.906
Say hello, fellas!

01:04:13.979 --> 01:04:15.139
- hi!

01:04:15.214 --> 01:04:16.613
And here's their hit-

01:04:16.682 --> 01:04:20.311
A big l.a. Fave rave at 10 minutes
Past 7:00 in the morning

01:04:20.386 --> 01:04:22.320
On kmpc...los Ã¡ngeles!

01:04:24.023 --> 01:04:26.287
Thanks, guys.
Just leave the headphones in there.

01:04:26.359 --> 01:04:28.122
That thing you do

01:04:28.194 --> 01:04:29.456
Breaking my heart-

01:04:29.528 --> 01:04:32.520
let me ask
You cats this question:

01:04:32.598 --> 01:04:34.190
Who were your influences?

01:04:34.266 --> 01:04:36.325
Which artists
Popped your cherry?

01:04:36.402 --> 01:04:37.460
The chantrellines.

01:04:40.506 --> 01:04:41.734
The chantrellines.

01:04:41.807 --> 01:04:43.331
Dion and the belmonts.

01:04:43.409 --> 01:04:46.469
Cap'n geech and
The shrimp shack shooters.

01:04:48.247 --> 01:04:49.509
Uh...stan getz-

01:04:49.582 --> 01:04:51.379
Anything he did on
The verve label...

01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:53.543
Bill evans trÃ­o,
Ira sullivan,

01:04:53.619 --> 01:04:55.610
Kenny durham,
John young...

01:04:56.522 --> 01:04:57.614
Del paxton.

01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:59.817
Yeah.

01:04:59.892 --> 01:05:02.827
Time to blow.
My uncle gave me that record,

01:05:02.895 --> 01:05:05.830
And we played it in
The high school band.

01:05:05.898 --> 01:05:08.833
Del paxton in the high school band-
That's wild.

01:05:08.901 --> 01:05:11.495
Yeah, we were pretty wild
In erie, penn.

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:13.504
There was this one time

01:05:13.572 --> 01:05:16.598
When we stayed up
Way past midnight, and...

01:05:19.845 --> 01:05:20.777
Smiling, smiling...

01:05:20.846 --> 01:05:23.314
Wait a minute, gigi.
Hold on, hold on.

01:05:23.382 --> 01:05:25.543
Let's have the label
Right side up, shall we?

01:05:25.618 --> 01:05:28.348
Hey, how come you guys
Don't have long hair like the beatles?

01:05:28.421 --> 01:05:30.013
Don't you guys
Like the beatles?

01:05:30.089 --> 01:05:32.023
You, in the linettes,
Are those prescription,

01:05:32.091 --> 01:05:34.025
Or are you just trying
To look cool?

01:05:34.093 --> 01:05:35.788
Well, I am
The drummer.

01:05:35.861 --> 01:05:36.850
Oh.

01:05:36.929 --> 01:05:38.260
Where the hell
Is solly?

01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:40.025
Sol siler is here!

01:05:40.099 --> 01:05:41.828

01:05:41.901 --> 01:05:44.199

01:05:46.038 --> 01:05:47.266
Hey, fran,
Is that you?

01:05:47.339 --> 01:05:48.328
How was
Acapulco, sol?

01:05:48.407 --> 01:05:49.635
Wonderful,
Wonderful.

01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:52.108
Did mimi go with you,
Or did she have to stay home?

01:05:52.178 --> 01:05:53.406
She had the flu.

01:05:53.479 --> 01:05:55.276
Solly, how's your pals
In the sheriff s department?

01:05:55.347 --> 01:05:58.748
You guys spend a little too much time
In the wrong places.

01:05:58.818 --> 01:06:01.446
Solly, is it true don drysdale
Gave you a sock in the snooker?

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.283
Old news, fred.
Old news.

01:06:03.355 --> 01:06:05.619
Business, gents.
Got to take care of business.

01:06:05.691 --> 01:06:08.251
Wanna tell you about my new boys,
The wonders.

01:06:08.327 --> 01:06:11.785
Top-10 and fastest ever
Teen sensations.

01:06:11.864 --> 01:06:14.992
Caused the worst riot in texas
Since oswald got shot.

01:06:15.067 --> 01:06:18.468
So, solly, saw you at chasen's
With suzanne pleshette.

01:06:18.537 --> 01:06:21.597
Quit with that.
The wife works upstairs.

01:06:21.674 --> 01:06:23.266
Let's go have
Some deli.

01:06:23.342 --> 01:06:24.309
Lookin' good.

01:06:24.376 --> 01:06:25.934
What about the
Dave clark five?

01:06:26.011 --> 01:06:28.605
You think all this
British beat stuff is new?

01:06:28.681 --> 01:06:31.115
Give us another month,
We'll be invading them.

01:06:31.183 --> 01:06:32.445
Is that it?

01:06:32.518 --> 01:06:33.485
Yeah.

01:06:33.552 --> 01:06:36.146
I'll be sure to give him
The message.

01:06:36.222 --> 01:06:38.622
Thank you.
Bye-bye.

01:06:38.691 --> 01:06:39.623
Hi.

01:06:39.692 --> 01:06:40.659
Hi.

01:06:40.726 --> 01:06:41.624
How you doin'?

01:06:41.694 --> 01:06:42.820
Good.

01:06:42.895 --> 01:06:46.626
So, how long have you worked
Here at play-tone?

01:06:46.699 --> 01:06:50.795
How long you been wearing
Such tight pants?

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:53.464
Wow, if that was
A pick-up line,

01:06:53.539 --> 01:06:55.404
We're a match
Made in heaven.

01:06:55.474 --> 01:06:56.702
Excuse me, mr. Siler.

01:06:56.775 --> 01:06:59.471
James mattingly ii,
Lead singer ofthe wonders.

01:06:59.545 --> 01:07:01.513
I wrote
That thing you do.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.138
I wrote many other songs

01:07:03.215 --> 01:07:05.979
That I think we should
Make an appointment and share.

01:07:06.051 --> 01:07:07.678
What is jimmy doing?

01:07:07.753 --> 01:07:08.845
arrghh!

01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:10.286
Jimmy!

01:07:10.356 --> 01:07:12.483
What in the bloody hell
Is this?

01:07:12.558 --> 01:07:14.025
This is during
My lunchtime?

01:07:14.093 --> 01:07:16.493
Yeah, like I got
Time on my hands-

01:07:16.562 --> 01:07:18.826
You wanna get fabian
Away from me?

01:07:18.898 --> 01:07:20.331
he doesn't know
Who we are.

01:07:20.399 --> 01:07:21.866
To him, we could
Be anybody.

01:07:21.934 --> 01:07:23.492
he knows who
The wonders are.

01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:25.332
he didn't listen
To any other songs?

01:07:25.404 --> 01:07:27.497
that guy hasn't even heard
That thing you do.

01:07:27.573 --> 01:07:30.667
I don't think sol siler's
The person who listens to songs.

01:07:30.743 --> 01:07:32.506
he's the guy
Who's in charge

01:07:32.578 --> 01:07:34.512
Of the entire
Play-tone galaxy.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.879
This is the man who's in charge
Of our collective fate,

01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:39.212
Our creative destiny.

01:07:39.285 --> 01:07:41.617
Oh...come on!

01:07:41.687 --> 01:07:44.451
Diane warned me
About this.

01:07:44.523 --> 01:07:46.991
Diane dane?

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.193
Diane dane.
What'd she say?

01:07:51.263 --> 01:07:53.288
Never trust a label.

01:07:53.365 --> 01:07:55.333
And I'm beginning
To believe her.

01:07:55.401 --> 01:07:56.629
Lenny:
Oh, I agree.

01:07:56.702 --> 01:08:00.297
Come on, they put us up
In a first-class hotel,

01:08:00.372 --> 01:08:04.331
All expenses paid
While our record climbs the charts.

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:06.901
Bunch of lying snakes.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.144
I'm sorry
I'm bugging you.

01:08:10.215 --> 01:08:14.083
I guess I'm alone
In my principles.

01:08:14.153 --> 01:08:15.415
Come on.

01:08:15.487 --> 01:08:18.354
There he goes, off to his room
To write that hit song,

01:08:18.424 --> 01:08:20.358
Alone /n
My principles.

01:08:20.426 --> 01:08:22.724
Young squires,
Young squires.

01:08:22.795 --> 01:08:25.319
Faye, I'm glad to see you're
Feeling better.

01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:26.658
- lenny, right?
- yeah.

01:08:26.732 --> 01:08:29.758
Listen, a major blonde
In a major car just pulled up.

01:08:29.835 --> 01:08:32.167
I think she wants
To show you the town.

01:08:34.773 --> 01:08:36.673
God! Great!

01:08:36.742 --> 01:08:38.971
Breath-good? No?

01:08:39.044 --> 01:08:41.478
All right. See you guys.

01:08:41.546 --> 01:08:44.107
Hold my calls.

01:08:44.183 --> 01:08:46.117
Listen, have you
Kids had dessert?

01:08:46.185 --> 01:08:47.709
Try the
Peach cobbler.

01:08:47.786 --> 01:08:49.377
Best in
The southland.

01:08:49.455 --> 01:08:52.515
Hey, I got you
Some flowers.

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:59.997
You gotta understand
Something aboutjimmy.

01:09:00.064 --> 01:09:02.658
His-his standards
Are way up there

01:09:02.734 --> 01:09:04.999
Because he's so smart.

01:09:05.069 --> 01:09:08.163
He tested in high school
At genius level,

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.970
So that's why...

01:09:17.049 --> 01:09:20.018
I feel terrible.
I'm gonna go back to bed.

01:09:20.085 --> 01:09:21.814
Yeah, that's
A good idea.

01:09:23.087 --> 01:09:24.180
Bye, faye.

01:09:24.256 --> 01:09:26.224
Bye. Thanks.

01:09:29.428 --> 01:09:30.986

01:09:35.401 --> 01:09:37.961
Ifjimmy's a genius...

01:09:38.037 --> 01:09:39.663
I'm u thant.

01:09:39.738 --> 01:09:41.671
Who's u thant?

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.970
He's the secre-
Forget it.

01:09:44.042 --> 01:09:45.977
You wanna get
Out of here?

01:09:46.045 --> 01:09:47.171
Go see some
Of the coast?

01:09:47.246 --> 01:09:49.180
Yes, definitely.

01:09:49.247 --> 01:09:51.443
Or maybe, um...

01:09:51.517 --> 01:09:53.417
What's that theater
That the, um-

01:09:53.484 --> 01:09:56.454
The movie stars put their hands
In the front?

01:09:56.522 --> 01:09:58.319
Oh. Grauman's
Chinese theater.

01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:59.789
That'd be fun.

01:10:01.427 --> 01:10:03.019
Excuse me, sirs.

01:10:03.095 --> 01:10:06.963
Um, I wanted to inform you
That I'll be joining your ranks soon,

01:10:07.032 --> 01:10:09.796
And, um, I can already
Do 200 pushups.

01:10:09.868 --> 01:10:10.926
Really, boot?

01:10:11.003 --> 01:10:11.970
Yes, sir.

01:10:12.037 --> 01:10:14.528
Why don't you give us 100

01:10:14.606 --> 01:10:15.732
Yes, sir!

01:10:15.808 --> 01:10:17.366
Count 'em off.

01:10:17.443 --> 01:10:18.375

Thank you.

01:10:19.778 --> 01:10:20.745

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.312
Hey, taxi,
Young squire?

01:10:29.388 --> 01:10:31.652
Um, yeah. Anybody

01:10:31.724 --> 01:10:34.158
I'll be at chasen's
With suzanne pleshette.

01:10:34.226 --> 01:10:35.318
Gotcha.

01:10:35.394 --> 01:10:37.954
Hey, lamarr, is there
Any place around here

01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:39.588
With really good jazz?

01:10:39.665 --> 01:10:41.599
Oh, you want good jazz?

01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:43.100
Good jazz?

01:10:43.168 --> 01:10:44.965
Let me ask you
A question.

01:10:45.037 --> 01:10:50.475
Who played coronet
Forjacques st. Claire on vital stats?

01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:51.770
Scotty mcdonald.

01:10:51.844 --> 01:10:55.280
Get in the cab.
Get in the cab!

01:10:55.347 --> 01:10:58.282
Take this young man
To the blue spot.

01:11:30.549 --> 01:11:34.645
Oh, good jazz.
They're fine!

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.086

Oh, yeah, yeah!

01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:09.412
Yeah.

01:12:14.526 --> 01:12:17.495
I left vancouver
For tacoma,

01:12:17.563 --> 01:12:20.794
Tacoma for portland...

01:12:20.866 --> 01:12:22.959
Oh, I got married
In portland. Yeah.

01:12:23.035 --> 01:12:25.629
Oh, and then I left portland
For reno,

01:12:25.704 --> 01:12:27.968
And then I got
Divorced in reno.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.133
Then wised up and faced
The inevitable.

01:12:30.209 --> 01:12:32.211
You know, I moved to l.a.

01:12:32.344 --> 01:12:35.142
Is the trÃ­o
Going on again?

01:12:36.315 --> 01:12:37.612
I don't know.

01:12:37.683 --> 01:12:39.344
Looks like they're
Kind of busy

01:12:39.418 --> 01:12:42.012
Doing the cock 'n' bull
With del there.

01:12:42.087 --> 01:12:43.054
Del?

01:12:43.121 --> 01:12:44.952
Yeah, del paxton.
One of the regulars.

01:12:45.023 --> 01:12:47.856
Roving hands,
But good cock 'n' bull.

01:12:47.926 --> 01:12:49.860
Del paxton.
Mm-hmm.

01:12:53.632 --> 01:12:55.190
Gabby, ha ha ha!

01:12:55.267 --> 01:12:58.168
Oh, gabby?
He owes me money, man.

01:12:58.237 --> 01:13:01.570
Oh...oh,
Oh, my god.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.337
Oh, my god. Del paxton
Is sitting over there.

01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:07.970
Oh, heh heh heh.

01:13:08.046 --> 01:13:09.980
I just lost you,
Didn't I?

01:13:10.048 --> 01:13:12.482
You wanna meet him?

01:13:15.087 --> 01:13:18.215
What? No...no.

01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:19.880

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:22.449

01:13:22.527 --> 01:13:24.461
Marguerite,
What you got here?

01:13:24.529 --> 01:13:25.962
You may not
Believe this, del,

01:13:26.031 --> 01:13:27.293
But this kid has
Heard of you.

01:13:27.366 --> 01:13:31.200
That right?
Well, sit down. Buy me a drink.

01:13:33.538 --> 01:13:35.870
Del paxton.
Who are you?

01:13:35.941 --> 01:13:38.239
I'm guy patterson.
I'm from erie, pennsylvania.

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:40.403
I'm in a band
Called the wonders,

01:13:40.479 --> 01:13:42.413
And we're-we
Just cut a record,

01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:44.449
And we're out here
On the coast,

01:13:44.516 --> 01:13:45.915
And I play
The drums,

01:13:45.984 --> 01:13:47.417
And I have
All your records.

01:13:47.486 --> 01:13:49.954
Well, not all of them,
But a lot of them.

01:13:50.022 --> 01:13:51.580
At least I did until
Some of them got swiped

01:13:51.657 --> 01:13:53.625
When I was stationed
In germany,

01:13:53.692 --> 01:13:54.750
And you were
Playing in germany

01:13:54.826 --> 01:13:56.191
At the time I was
Stationed there.

01:13:56.261 --> 01:13:57.660
But, you know what?
I couldn't see you

01:13:57.729 --> 01:13:58.991
Because you were
Playing in hamburg

01:13:59.064 --> 01:14:00.292
And I was stationed
In munich.

01:14:00.365 --> 01:14:02.094
But I listen
To your records,

01:14:02.167 --> 01:14:03.566
And I think
You're great.

01:14:03.635 --> 01:14:07.628
You are
My biggest fan.

01:14:07.706 --> 01:14:08.934
Heh heh.

01:14:09.007 --> 01:14:10.099
Thanks.

01:14:10.175 --> 01:14:11.904
I'll have another
Hennessey.

01:14:11.977 --> 01:14:13.808
A hennessey for
Del paxton.

01:14:13.879 --> 01:14:14.937
All right.

01:14:18.216 --> 01:14:20.650
Ain't no way to keep
A band together.

01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:22.414
Bands come and go.

01:14:22.487 --> 01:14:27.823
You got to keep on playin',
No matter with who.

01:14:27.893 --> 01:14:29.622
You guys any good?

01:14:29.695 --> 01:14:31.788
Yeah.

01:14:31.863 --> 01:14:33.797
Yeah, man, we got-

01:14:33.865 --> 01:14:38.063
Jimmy and lenny
And me and...faye-

01:14:39.971 --> 01:14:42.235
We got something
Snappy.

01:14:42.307 --> 01:14:43.934
Really think we do.

01:14:44.009 --> 01:14:45.533
I'm sure you do,

01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:49.569
But sooner or later,
Something makes you crazy:

01:14:49.648 --> 01:14:53.744
Money, women, the road.

01:14:53.819 --> 01:14:56.447
Hell, man,just time.

01:14:56.521 --> 01:14:59.081
Well, we've only been
Together for 2 months.

01:14:59.157 --> 01:15:03.184
Some bands I been with,
That's 2 months too long.

01:15:03.261 --> 01:15:06.025
Last call, lovers.

01:15:07.999 --> 01:15:10.627
I'm gone.

01:15:10.702 --> 01:15:13.102
You keep on playin'...

01:15:13.171 --> 01:15:14.968
And watch your money.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.133
You'll land
On your feet.

01:15:20.045 --> 01:15:21.637
Thanks for
Your hospitality.

01:15:21.713 --> 01:15:24.614
Thank you,
Del paxton.

01:15:24.683 --> 01:15:27.117
Nice young man,
Huh, marguerite?

01:15:27.185 --> 01:15:29.949
Oh, very nice
Young man, del.

01:15:30.021 --> 01:15:31.215
Good night.

01:15:31.289 --> 01:15:32.381

01:15:32.457 --> 01:15:33.890
Thank you, del!

01:15:37.028 --> 01:15:38.757
Just look at you.

01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:41.060
You're no good
To me now.

01:15:42.667 --> 01:15:44.225
Lamarr:
Taxi! Over here!

01:15:51.176 --> 01:15:53.041
good morning, guy.
We have a crisis here.

01:15:53.111 --> 01:15:54.669
Your bass player
Has disappeared,

01:15:54.746 --> 01:15:56.373
And you are still in bed!

01:15:56.448 --> 01:15:59.576
Just calling to tell you
To get your patootie down
To the televisiÃ³n studio!

01:15:59.651 --> 01:16:01.744
You're gonna be
On tv tonight!

01:16:10.762 --> 01:16:12.855
Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:16:29.014 --> 01:16:30.003
Hiya!

01:16:30.081 --> 01:16:31.139
Where's lenny?

01:16:31.216 --> 01:16:33.309
Gettin' me a soda.

01:16:33.385 --> 01:16:34.352
Where's jimmy?

01:16:34.419 --> 01:16:37.786

In the bathroom?

01:16:41.693 --> 01:16:43.661
Holy cow! What's
Wrong with you?

01:16:46.198 --> 01:16:48.166
Hey, guy, I think-

01:16:48.233 --> 01:16:51.031
I think faye
Gave me something.

01:16:51.102 --> 01:16:52.967
We're on tv
In a few hours.

01:16:53.038 --> 01:16:54.005
I know!

01:16:54.072 --> 01:16:56.131
Hey, guy,
What do you think of her?

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:57.766
She was
A playboy bunny!

01:16:57.843 --> 01:17:00.311
Took me up to
Her apartment last night,

01:17:00.378 --> 01:17:01.970
Way up with
The coyotes,

01:17:02.047 --> 01:17:03.639
Where I did me
Some howling.

01:17:03.715 --> 01:17:05.012
Where's
Our bass player?

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:06.015
Isn't he here?

01:17:06.084 --> 01:17:07.813
No. I gotta call
The hotel.

01:17:07.886 --> 01:17:09.854
How far a drive
Is it to las vegas?

01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:11.513
'Cause I'm driving
There tonight,

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:13.319
Through the desert
With the top down.

01:17:13.391 --> 01:17:15.985
I'm in love, skitch!
Freakin' stars in my head.

01:17:18.063 --> 01:17:20.122
Upchucking,
Mr. Hammerstein?

01:17:20.198 --> 01:17:23.031
Are you nervous about tonight's
Big live broadcast?

01:17:23.101 --> 01:17:24.932
Huh? Huhhhhhh?

01:17:25.003 --> 01:17:27.665
No. I've left 15 messages!

01:17:27.739 --> 01:17:30.469
Where the hell is he?

01:17:30.542 --> 01:17:32.169
Aaaah!

01:17:34.412 --> 01:17:35.310
Whooo!

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:37.245
Yeah!

01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:39.783
Yeah!

01:17:45.323 --> 01:17:46.722
I don't know
Where he is,

01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:49.453
But he was joining the marines
In august anyway.

01:17:49.528 --> 01:17:51.291
This was gonna happen sooner or later.

01:17:51.363 --> 01:17:53.991
Guy, say hello to wolfman,
Mr. Scott pell.

01:17:54.065 --> 01:17:55.657

01:17:55.734 --> 01:17:56.666
Yes.

01:17:56.735 --> 01:17:58.066
Who's he
Played with?

01:17:58.136 --> 01:18:00.070
The techniques...

01:18:00.138 --> 01:18:02.936
Uh, roy maxwell
And the corsairs.

01:18:03.008 --> 01:18:05.602
Ha ha...
Really?

01:18:05.677 --> 01:18:08.009
He's your
New bass player.

01:18:08.079 --> 01:18:10.343
Mr. White,
No offense...

01:18:10.415 --> 01:18:12.610
I- we've been together
For a while.

01:18:12.684 --> 01:18:14.743
There aren't a lot
Of options here, guy.

01:18:14.819 --> 01:18:16.912
Can he handle
Our tune?

01:18:16.988 --> 01:18:19.320
I think I can
Handle it,junior.

01:18:31.903 --> 01:18:32.870
Ok.

01:18:32.938 --> 01:18:34.030
All right.

01:18:34.105 --> 01:18:35.629
Mr. White...

01:18:35.707 --> 01:18:37.334
Faye's not gonna
Miss this, is she?

01:18:37.409 --> 01:18:38.774
Oh, no.
She'll be here.

01:18:38.843 --> 01:18:40.401
I've taken care
Of her.

01:19:04.936 --> 01:19:07.962
from the brand-new
City of broadcasting

01:19:08.039 --> 01:19:09.973
In santa monica,
California,

01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:12.839
It's the hollywood televisiÃ³n showcase!

01:19:12.911 --> 01:19:16.176

The remote control.

01:19:40.005 --> 01:19:41.438
Give me
The remote control.

01:19:41.506 --> 01:19:43.064
Hey, mr. P,
Do you think guy

01:19:44.476 --> 01:19:46.273
Oh, man, wouldn't
That be something

01:19:46.344 --> 01:19:48.141
If he met
Gus grissom?

01:19:48.213 --> 01:19:50.113
That's a good picture
There now.

01:19:50.181 --> 01:19:51.205
Look at that.

01:19:51.282 --> 01:19:53.614
...nylon,
And acrylon fibers.

01:19:53.685 --> 01:19:56.313
And now, here's the star
Of this week's showcase...

01:19:56.388 --> 01:19:59.289

Thank you!

01:20:13.471 --> 01:20:14.904

Everybody settle down.

He won't be on for
Another half-hour.

01:20:16.474 --> 01:20:18.408
They got a bunch of other acts
That come on before.

01:20:18.476 --> 01:20:20.068
Yeah. Last week,
They had this elephant-

01:20:20.145 --> 01:20:21.578
Oh, playing
The harmonica!

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:27.042
But seriously, gus...

01:20:27.118 --> 01:20:29.814
What is it like flying up there
In outer space

01:20:29.888 --> 01:20:31.446
In the-what is it-
The gemini?

01:20:31.523 --> 01:20:33.718
That's right, troy.
It'll be called the gemini.

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:35.987
See, I guess I'd
Have to say

01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:37.619
That flying
In outer space

01:20:37.696 --> 01:20:40.256
Is a lot like your working
With gina lollobrigida

01:20:40.331 --> 01:20:41.593
In your
Latest movie-

01:20:41.666 --> 01:20:44.157
It's out of
This worid.

01:20:44.235 --> 01:20:45.497
Here's a question
I have...

01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:46.559
Going back
To one.

01:20:46.638 --> 01:20:47.570
How's the food?

01:20:47.639 --> 01:20:48.571
Go one!

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:49.868
It's pretty good,
Troy.

01:20:49.941 --> 01:20:52.569
Nasa's working on
New zero-g food all the time.

01:20:52.644 --> 01:20:53.941
- take 2!
- like what?

01:20:54.012 --> 01:20:55.274
Well,just last week,

01:20:55.346 --> 01:20:57.314
I sampled a compressed
Turkey product,

01:20:57.382 --> 01:20:58.781
Processed succotash,

01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:01.114
And a packet of concentrated
Prune juice-

01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:21.065
Oh...that's gotta hurt.

01:21:21.139 --> 01:21:24.006
teen sensations
The wonders to the stage, please.

01:21:24.075 --> 01:21:25.133
Boys, we go.

01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:27.303
Teen sensations the wonders
To the stage.

01:21:27.378 --> 01:21:29.744
You look fabulous
In the black suits-

01:21:29.814 --> 01:21:31.782
Hi-fabulous in
The black suits.

01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:34.182
I can just imagine
Guy backstage right now,

01:21:34.252 --> 01:21:35.810
Just waiting to go on.

01:21:35.887 --> 01:21:38.754
You think they'll show
A shot of him backstage, dear,

01:21:38.823 --> 01:21:40.085
Waiting to go on?

01:21:40.158 --> 01:21:41.921
No, honey, they won't show
Him backstage.

01:21:41.993 --> 01:21:43.927
They'll show him
When he comes out to perform.

01:21:43.995 --> 01:21:45.758
I wonder how many people
Are watching this.

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:48.196
How many people saw the beatles
On the ed sullivan show?

01:21:49.834 --> 01:21:52.462
Excuse me.
Is that where the wonders come out?

01:21:52.537 --> 01:21:54.095
Yeah, right there.

01:22:00.445 --> 01:22:02.276
Hey, skitch...

01:22:02.347 --> 01:22:04.679

And now...
For you kids,

01:22:21.533 --> 01:22:23.558
The latest
Rock 'n' roll group

01:22:23.635 --> 01:22:26.297
To challenge the beatles
To a hair-combing contest-

01:22:26.371 --> 01:22:28.168
That's just
What we all need-

01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:31.640
The new teen sensations,
The wonders!

01:22:43.655 --> 01:22:45.088

There he is!
Just look at him!

01:23:01.472 --> 01:23:03.770
Ha ha ha ha!

01:23:03.842 --> 01:23:07.972

About the heartache

01:23:08.046 --> 01:23:11.106

01:23:11.182 --> 01:23:14.310
Well, I've tried and tried
To forget you, girl

01:23:14.385 --> 01:23:18.481
But it's just
So hard to do

01:23:18.556 --> 01:23:22.652
Every time you do
That thing you do

01:23:25.363 --> 01:23:26.295

01:23:26.364 --> 01:23:27.296
Ready 4!

To hurry this.

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.565
...Things you play

01:23:30.635 --> 01:23:33.160
Slow move in.
There's not a big hurry here.

01:23:33.238 --> 01:23:34.466
Not a big hurry.

01:23:34.539 --> 01:23:37.337
Nice and easy.
That's a pretty shot.

01:23:37.408 --> 01:23:39.342
That a baby!
That a baby!

01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:41.002
'Cause we

01:23:41.079 --> 01:23:44.708
Could be happy,
Can't you see?

01:23:44.782 --> 01:23:47.182
And knowin' that we...

01:23:47.252 --> 01:23:48.981
Quiet down!
I'm trying to hear it!

Ahh ahh

01:23:50.088 --> 01:23:53.251
To keep me here

01:23:53.324 --> 01:23:56.782
Well, I've tried and tried
To forget you, girl

01:23:56.861 --> 01:23:59.091
But it's just
So hard to do

01:23:59.163 --> 01:24:00.653
Doo-ooh

01:24:00.732 --> 01:24:04.691
Every time you do
That thing you do

01:24:07.839 --> 01:24:09.636
I don't ask around,
Girl

01:24:09.707 --> 01:24:10.799
I don't
Ask around...

01:24:10.875 --> 01:24:12.308
Supers coming up.

01:24:12.377 --> 01:24:14.675
It's time for america
To meet the wonders.

01:24:14.746 --> 01:24:16.441

Look good.

01:24:16.514 --> 01:24:17.947

Take it anymore...

01:24:23.054 --> 01:24:24.112
And go!

01:24:24.188 --> 01:24:26.452

A good-looking kid.

01:24:26.524 --> 01:24:29.186
And go!

Congratulations,

01:24:37.335 --> 01:24:38.529
Hold it...

01:24:38.603 --> 01:24:42.130
...Could be happy,
Can't you see?

01:24:42.206 --> 01:24:47.007
If you'd only let me
Be the one to hold you

01:24:47.078 --> 01:24:51.071
And keep you
Here with me

01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:54.607
'Cause it hurts me so
Just to see you go

01:24:54.686 --> 01:24:56.916
Around with
Someone new

01:24:56.988 --> 01:24:58.012
New-ooh

01:24:58.089 --> 01:25:00.080
And if I know you

01:25:00.158 --> 01:25:02.558
You're doin'
That thing

01:25:02.627 --> 01:25:06.028
Every day,
Just doin' that thing

01:25:06.097 --> 01:25:11.194
I can't take you
Doin' that thing you do

01:25:17.175 --> 01:25:18.972
Aaaaah!

01:25:25.583 --> 01:25:28.984

For you, babe

01:25:29.053 --> 01:25:30.384

Oh, that's
Hilarious!

01:25:34.158 --> 01:25:35.557
Oh, thank you.

01:25:35.626 --> 01:25:37.457
Whoo hoo hoo!

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:45.831
So, it just
Appeared...

01:25:45.903 --> 01:25:47.495
Like magic...

01:25:47.572 --> 01:25:48.561
For the whole worid
To see.

01:25:48.639 --> 01:25:50.072
I didn't
Say anything.

01:25:50.141 --> 01:25:51.870
I was just as
Surprised as you.

01:25:51.943 --> 01:25:55.572
"Careful, giris,
He's engaged."

01:25:55.646 --> 01:25:57.273
Am I supposed to buy you
Some diamond ring now?

01:25:57.348 --> 01:26:01.216
You're ruining this
Beautiful moment.

01:26:01.285 --> 01:26:02.912
Where'd you get the idea
That we're engaged?

01:26:02.987 --> 01:26:04.784
We're not!

01:26:04.856 --> 01:26:06.619
That's the last thing
I need in the worid.

01:26:06.691 --> 01:26:08.591
- we were great! What,
Are you kidding?

01:26:08.659 --> 01:26:10.217
you're kidding.
You kidder.

01:26:10.294 --> 01:26:12.888
Hey, man, you have a couple
Of hundred bucks?

01:26:12.964 --> 01:26:16.695
I need some extra scratch
For the craps tables.

01:26:16.768 --> 01:26:17.735
No.

01:26:17.802 --> 01:26:18.894
No?

01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:20.062
Come on!
Just a little bit.

01:26:20.138 --> 01:26:22.606
This is my first trip
To vegas.

01:26:22.673 --> 01:26:24.834
Try guy.
He's a sucker.

01:26:24.909 --> 01:26:26.809
Well, that was
Very nice.

01:26:26.878 --> 01:26:30.541
Whitey, can you spot me
Some blackjack cash?

01:26:30.615 --> 01:26:32.276
That would be
Against my policy.

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:34.384
Mr. White,
It isn't true.

01:26:34.517 --> 01:26:36.576
Oh ho
Ho ho!

01:26:36.652 --> 01:26:37.880
Guy, can I borrow
Some money?

01:26:37.954 --> 01:26:39.888
200 bucks.
How much you want?

01:26:39.956 --> 01:26:42.390
Hah. Chump change.

01:26:43.926 --> 01:26:46.451
Good lord, faye,
You look gorgeous.

01:26:49.265 --> 01:26:51.495
Now, next up
For you kids...

01:26:51.567 --> 01:26:53.865
You get to make
Another record.

01:26:53.936 --> 01:26:56.234
Can I say
Something?

01:26:56.305 --> 01:26:58.239
Hey, the fair faye
Wishes to address us all,

01:26:58.307 --> 01:26:59.706
So it's...

01:27:01.878 --> 01:27:05.541
Jimmy...

01:27:05.615 --> 01:27:08.049
From now on,
You stay away from me.

01:27:12.955 --> 01:27:18.359
I have wasted thousands
And thousands of kisses on you.

01:27:18.428 --> 01:27:22.262
Kisses that I thought
Were special because
Of your lips and your smile

01:27:22.331 --> 01:27:25.664
And all your
Color and life.

01:27:25.735 --> 01:27:29.330
I used to think that was the real you
When you smiled.

01:27:29.405 --> 01:27:32.841
But now I know that you
Don't mean any of it,

01:27:32.909 --> 01:27:35.605
And you just save it
For all your songs.

01:27:42.785 --> 01:27:48.280
Shame on me for kissing you
With my eyes closed so tight.

01:28:00.069 --> 01:28:02.731
Should've dumped you
In pittsburgh!

01:28:04.373 --> 01:28:06.671
Which one of you butts
Said we were engaged?

01:28:10.646 --> 01:28:14.104
The same person who said
You had class,jimmy.

01:28:17.119 --> 01:28:18.484
Let's blow, babe.

01:28:18.554 --> 01:28:20.146
Get that desert air
In my hair.

01:28:20.223 --> 01:28:21.884
Ok.

01:28:21.958 --> 01:28:24.449
Do we really have to go
With the top down?

01:28:35.872 --> 01:28:38.306
Take those stupid
Sunglasses off.

01:28:46.616 --> 01:28:49.551
Why couldn't you
Have dumped her in pittsburgh?

01:28:57.293 --> 01:29:00.387
We do my songs,
Or we don't record anything.

01:29:00.463 --> 01:29:02.795
You got that, white?

01:29:05.001 --> 01:29:07.595
Ok.jimmy.

01:29:07.670 --> 01:29:09.729
I was looking forward
To working with you.

01:29:09.805 --> 01:29:12.433
You know,
You're a liar, white!

01:29:12.508 --> 01:29:14.135
You're a liar.

01:29:14.210 --> 01:29:15.734
And you're in
A tough spot,jimmy,

01:29:15.811 --> 01:29:18.746
'Cause you didn't read
The play-tone contract
That you yourself signed,

01:29:18.814 --> 01:29:21.908
Because it says
You do what I say.

01:29:21.984 --> 01:29:25.476
And I say you cover
These songs from
The play-tone catalog.

01:29:25.555 --> 01:29:27.716
You record that thing you do
In spanish.

01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:30.258
You get one cut
Per side of the lp,

01:29:30.326 --> 01:29:32.590
But I don't want any of
This lover's lament crap.

01:29:32.662 --> 01:29:35.597
I want something peppy,
Something happy,
Something up-tempo.

01:29:35.665 --> 01:29:38.759
I want something snappy.

01:29:48.878 --> 01:29:50.004
All right.

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.514
I...

01:29:53.583 --> 01:29:55.016
I quit

01:29:55.084 --> 01:29:56.779
I quit

01:29:56.852 --> 01:29:57.944
I quit

01:30:00.022 --> 01:30:01.649
I quit, mr. White.

01:30:16.238 --> 01:30:17.569
Jimmy just quit.

01:30:19.475 --> 01:30:22.706
Your band is
Falling apart, guy.

01:30:22.778 --> 01:30:23.904
Where's lenny?

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:26.141
I have no idea.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.083
I am so happy!

01:30:36.058 --> 01:30:37.958
Oh, I can't wait
For tonight!

01:30:38.027 --> 01:30:40.018
Oh, yeah!
Thanks so much.

01:30:40.096 --> 01:30:41.529
I really-
Thanks a lot!

01:30:41.597 --> 01:30:43.428
Thanks
For being here!

01:30:43.499 --> 01:30:44.466
Thanks for
Sharing!

01:30:44.533 --> 01:30:46.797
Oh, wow, I'm really so happy.

01:30:46.869 --> 01:30:49.736
Well, I guess
You don't need me today.

01:30:49.805 --> 01:30:51.830
Yeah. Wolfman,
Thank you very much.

01:30:51.907 --> 01:30:53.272
You're a good man,
Scott pell.

01:30:53.342 --> 01:30:55.276
Give me a call
Later on in the week.

01:30:55.344 --> 01:30:56.777
We'll do something.

01:30:59.015 --> 01:31:00.573
I can't believe this.

01:31:03.185 --> 01:31:06.450
The wonders are
In breach of contract.

01:31:06.522 --> 01:31:08.513
I'm sorry.

01:31:08.591 --> 01:31:10.183
I'm really sorry,
Mr. White.

01:31:13.229 --> 01:31:16.630
Well, don't worry.
No one's going to prison, son.

01:31:17.667 --> 01:31:20.067
It's a very common tale.

01:31:20.136 --> 01:31:22.263
Well, maybe for you,
But I was in a band,

01:31:22.338 --> 01:31:24.363
And we still have
A hit record.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.169
Yeah, you do.

01:31:26.242 --> 01:31:28.107
One-hit wonders.

01:31:28.177 --> 01:31:30.509
It's a very
Common tale.

01:31:34.583 --> 01:31:37.416
My first time in
A real recording studio.

01:31:38.888 --> 01:31:40.685
You want to hang
Around for a while?

01:31:40.756 --> 01:31:41.814
Ok by me.

01:31:41.891 --> 01:31:44.860
But you're out of the hotel
This afternoon.

01:31:44.927 --> 01:31:47.157
Can't help that.

01:31:50.566 --> 01:31:53.091
You know, guy, horace
Was right about you.

01:31:53.169 --> 01:31:54.830
You are the smart one.

01:31:54.904 --> 01:31:56.633
Lenny is the fool.

01:31:56.706 --> 01:32:00.608
Jimmy is...the talent.

01:32:00.676 --> 01:32:02.439
Faye is...

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:07.378
Well, now, faye is
Special, isn't she?

01:32:13.489 --> 01:32:16.049
And you are
The smart one.

01:32:17.426 --> 01:32:19.656
That's what
I think anyway.

01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:02.187
How you been?

01:34:02.264 --> 01:34:03.663
Doing all right.
How about you?

01:34:03.732 --> 01:34:05.063
All right.
Hanging in.

01:34:22.117 --> 01:34:25.416
what do you call that?

01:34:29.558 --> 01:34:31.458
/ am spartacus.

01:34:31.527 --> 01:34:34.394
Ha ha ha!
You wanna lay it down?

01:34:35.764 --> 01:34:37.994
Nah. I was just
Goofing around.

01:34:41.971 --> 01:34:43.802
Hey, my man.

01:34:46.008 --> 01:34:47.339
Hey, del!

01:34:49.144 --> 01:34:50.668
What's your name again?

01:34:50.746 --> 01:34:53.613
Guy...uh,
Guy patterson.

01:34:53.682 --> 01:34:57.482
Guy. Yeah,
That's right.

01:34:57.553 --> 01:34:59.248
Hey, you're good.

01:34:59.321 --> 01:35:00.982
Oh, you heard that?

01:35:01.056 --> 01:35:02.489
Swing.

01:35:03.726 --> 01:35:04.658
Thank you.

01:35:04.727 --> 01:35:07.855
Uh, can I jam
With you a bit?

01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:09.397
You want to jam
With me?

01:35:09.465 --> 01:35:11.695
Why not?

01:35:14.103 --> 01:35:16.594
Sure. Sure.

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.171
All right.

01:35:19.241 --> 01:35:22.039
What are you
Doing here?

01:35:22.111 --> 01:35:25.137
Recording some tracks in studio c
With willy walker.

01:35:25.214 --> 01:35:28.183
Willy walker?

01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:29.842
Can he jam
With us, too?

01:35:29.919 --> 01:35:32.945
Nah, let's keep
This a duet.

01:35:33.022 --> 01:35:35.547
Let's play that spartacus again.

01:35:37.259 --> 01:35:38.749
Hey, ernie...

01:35:38.827 --> 01:35:40.886
Roll tape on this.

01:35:40.963 --> 01:35:42.931
You got it, del.

01:35:42.998 --> 01:35:44.056
Go ahead.
Count it off.

01:35:44.133 --> 01:35:46.328
1...2...3...4.

01:36:19.969 --> 01:36:21.129
Hey!

01:36:21.203 --> 01:36:23.535
Yeah. I'll talk
To you later.

01:36:23.605 --> 01:36:25.470
Hey, hey, hey.
Slow down there, young squire.

01:36:25.541 --> 01:36:26.530
Life is long.

01:36:26.608 --> 01:36:27.836
I got to check out.

01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:29.468
Oh, you're leaving us
Today, too, huh?

01:36:29.545 --> 01:36:30.773
Yeah, well, that
Partner of yours-

01:36:30.846 --> 01:36:31.835
The one with all
The attitude?

01:36:31.914 --> 01:36:33.142
He left here hours ago.

01:36:33.215 --> 01:36:35.683
And your little fifi
Is about to vamoose as well.

01:36:37.052 --> 01:36:39.282
Wait, fifi-you mean faye.
Is she still here?

01:36:39.355 --> 01:36:42.256
Yeah. She's sitting there
In the coffee shop.

01:36:42.324 --> 01:36:44.383
At the counter. Alone.

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.121
Now, where I come from,
That just ain't right.

01:36:46.195 --> 01:36:47.594
Take that.

01:36:47.663 --> 01:36:49.631
lamarr here.

01:36:49.698 --> 01:36:50.892
Yes, sir.
Blue impala.

01:36:50.966 --> 01:36:53.093
Absolutely.
Uh-huh.

01:36:54.737 --> 01:36:56.102
Thank you, sir.

01:36:56.171 --> 01:36:58.662
Hey, hey, hey!
Now, that ain't your job.

01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:03.567
Del says I got the chops to make it
As a drummer in l.a.

01:37:03.645 --> 01:37:06.614
- oh.
- so I think I'm gonna
Give it a try.

01:37:06.682 --> 01:37:08.650
Really?

01:37:11.553 --> 01:37:16.320
So, you're-you're gonna be
A permanent west coaster?

01:37:16.392 --> 01:37:18.417
Yeah, it looks
That way.

01:37:18.494 --> 01:37:19.825
Wow.

01:37:23.032 --> 01:37:24.829
So, what are you
Gonna do?

01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:26.959
Hmm...

01:37:29.238 --> 01:37:31.001
I'm gonna
Go back to erie.

01:37:34.710 --> 01:37:36.837
Figured that's
What you'd say.

01:37:41.617 --> 01:37:43.141
Guy...

01:37:43.218 --> 01:37:44.947
Can I ask you
A question?

01:37:46.422 --> 01:37:47.548
Shoot.

01:37:49.825 --> 01:37:51.417
Were you in love
In erie?

01:37:54.463 --> 01:37:56.931
You know,
I thought so.

01:37:56.999 --> 01:37:58.728
With that
Tina woman?

01:38:00.035 --> 01:38:01.969
She wasn't right
For you.

01:38:06.008 --> 01:38:07.566
Was she
A good kisser?

01:38:07.643 --> 01:38:11.636
Yeah.

01:38:11.713 --> 01:38:13.203
Yeah?

01:38:13.282 --> 01:38:17.742
It would be ungentlemanly
For me to elaborate.

01:38:19.121 --> 01:38:22.249
Gentlemen- I forgot what you
Fellas looked like.

01:38:25.527 --> 01:38:28.257
Well, sir...

01:38:28.330 --> 01:38:31.128
If you ever
Come back to erie,

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.259
Please stop by
And see me.

01:38:35.003 --> 01:38:36.766
Right. We'll listen
To records.

01:38:36.839 --> 01:38:40.036
That'd be nice.

01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:42.600
And here's good-bye.

01:38:46.181 --> 01:38:49.981
You know that none
Of this would have happened

01:38:50.052 --> 01:38:53.180
If you hadn't
Joined the band.

01:38:53.255 --> 01:38:55.314
And I mean that
In a good way.

01:39:06.034 --> 01:39:07.092
Bye.

01:39:42.371 --> 01:39:44.532
So, young squire...

01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:53.748
Before you go...

01:39:53.815 --> 01:39:56.113
Let me ask you
One question.

01:39:56.185 --> 01:39:57.243
Shoot.

01:39:59.021 --> 01:40:01.990
When was the last time you were
Decently kissed?

01:40:03.258 --> 01:40:07.854
I mean, truly, truly...
Good and kissed?

01:40:14.403 --> 01:40:17.065
Dave gammelgard...

01:40:17.139 --> 01:40:19.300
New year's eve...

01:40:19.374 --> 01:40:20.841
'61.

01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:28.548
Ok.

01:40:30.586 --> 01:40:31.678
Mm!

01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:10.483
Whoo.

01:41:14.663 --> 01:41:16.096
Whoo.

01:41:18.033 --> 01:41:20.399
We should have done that
A long time ago.

01:41:24.039 --> 01:41:25.563
Yeah.

01:41:41.056 --> 01:41:42.956
Lamarr, would you mind
Watching our things?

01:41:43.025 --> 01:41:45.493
Oh, that's
What I do.

01:42:07.848 --> 01:42:09.907
I never thought my life

01:42:09.984 --> 01:42:14.546
Would end up
Quite this way

01:42:14.621 --> 01:42:17.556
Sometimes
It's hard to figure out

01:42:17.624 --> 01:42:21.492
What I should say

01:42:21.562 --> 01:42:27.296
I tried alone
To mend this broken heart

01:42:27.368 --> 01:42:30.895
I need you

01:42:30.971 --> 01:42:36.136
That thing you do

01:42:38.312 --> 01:42:39.711
When we're apart

01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:45.013
I find it very hard
To smile

01:42:45.085 --> 01:42:47.110
You know that
Other giris

01:42:47.187 --> 01:42:51.749
Have never been
My style

01:42:51.825 --> 01:42:54.692
Well, there's a feeling
That I get

01:42:54.762 --> 01:42:57.560
When I'm near you

01:42:57.631 --> 01:43:01.362
I need you

01:43:01.435 --> 01:43:05.098
That thing you do

01:43:08.876 --> 01:43:11.504
I could search
Around the worid

01:43:11.578 --> 01:43:15.605
Only to find

01:43:15.682 --> 01:43:17.616
The only thing I need

01:43:17.684 --> 01:43:24.988
Is you right by my side

01:43:35.903 --> 01:43:38.269
There's a feeling
That I get

01:43:38.338 --> 01:43:41.501
When I'm with you

01:43:41.575 --> 01:43:45.375
Oh, oh, oh

01:43:45.446 --> 01:43:49.405
That thing you do

01:43:49.483 --> 01:43:51.951
I could search
Around the worid

01:43:52.019 --> 01:43:56.012
Only to find

01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:58.285
The only thing I need

01:43:58.358 --> 01:44:02.954
Is you right by my side

01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:04.964
I never thought my life

01:44:05.032 --> 01:44:09.435
Would end up
Quite this way

01:44:09.503 --> 01:44:12.370
Sometimes it's hard
To figure out

01:44:12.439 --> 01:44:16.307
What I should say

01:44:16.376 --> 01:44:22.178
I've tried alone
To mend this broken heart

01:44:22.249 --> 01:44:25.707
I need you

01:44:25.786 --> 01:44:29.916
That thing you do

01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:32.720
I need you

01:44:32.793 --> 01:44:40.564
That thing you do

01:44:47.207 --> 01:44:53.043
I've never known
Someone like this

01:44:53.113 --> 01:44:57.846
She's got a look
I can't resist

01:44:57.918 --> 01:45:01.285
I know

01:45:01.355 --> 01:45:04.813
In just a little while

01:45:04.892 --> 01:45:10.797
I'll be the one
That makes her smile

01:45:10.864 --> 01:45:16.734
Her parents say
That I'm no good

01:45:16.803 --> 01:45:21.536
I don't come
From her neighborhood

01:45:21.608 --> 01:45:24.839
Ohh

01:45:24.912 --> 01:45:29.474
Before too long
They'll see though

01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:34.578
Just what
She sees in me

01:45:34.655 --> 01:45:37.522
But when
She holds my hand

01:45:37.591 --> 01:45:42.688
I think
She understands

01:45:42.763 --> 01:45:44.560
She knows it

01:45:57.110 --> 01:46:00.204
It's true

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:04.114
It might take
A little while

01:46:04.184 --> 01:46:10.020
I'll be the one
That makes her smile

01:46:10.090 --> 01:46:12.991
But when
She holds my hand

01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:18.191
I think
She understands

01:46:18.265 --> 01:46:21.928
She knows it

01:46:22.002 --> 01:46:25.335
She knows

01:46:25.405 --> 01:46:28.533
She knows

01:46:28.609 --> 01:46:30.133
She knows

01:46:30.210 --> 01:46:34.169
She knows
All my hopes and dreams

01:46:34.248 --> 01:46:37.046
She knows

01:46:37.117 --> 01:46:39.881
She knows

01:46:39.953 --> 01:46:41.682
She knows

01:46:41.755 --> 01:46:45.555
She means
Everything to me

01:46:45.626 --> 01:46:51.622
Someday
I'm gonna make her see

01:46:51.698 --> 01:46:56.294
How good together
We can be

01:46:56.370 --> 01:46:59.464
It's true

01:46:59.539 --> 01:47:03.373
It might take
A little time

01:47:03.443 --> 01:47:09.279
One day I'm gonna
Make her mine

01:47:09.349 --> 01:47:12.284
But when
She holds my hand

01:47:12.352 --> 01:47:17.255
I think
She understands

01:47:17.324 --> 01:47:20.350
She knows it

01:47:20.427 --> 01:47:23.362
She knows it

01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:25.295
She knows it

01:47:26.305 --> 01:47:32.407
