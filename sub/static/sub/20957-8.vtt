00:00.023 --> 00:01.924
<i>Previously on "Wynonna Earp"...</i>

00:02.660 --> 00:05.995
- Bobo moved the second seal.
- The seal is in Shorty's.

00:06.367 --> 00:08.526
When the Earp heir turns 27,

00:08.570 --> 00:10.902
those of us killed
by the last one, we resurrect.

00:10.964 --> 00:13.394
I put your boys back together.
You get me that lead.

00:13.441 --> 00:16.248
- Tell me about the Earp Curse.
- Revenge for the death of our boys.

00:16.303 --> 00:19.504
Then I threw you down a well.
Decades in the dark.

00:19.539 --> 00:22.373
I can't end the curse unless I send
every single revenant back to Hell.

00:22.409 --> 00:26.210
Triangle's not only a prison.
It's also a sanctuary.

00:26.246 --> 00:28.653
- For who?
- Not a "who."

00:28.716 --> 00:30.075
A what.

00:31.151 --> 00:33.084
Willa, no!

00:36.489 --> 00:38.529
Why is she so mean?

00:48.879 --> 00:51.336
When I fell through I was scared,

00:51.371 --> 00:54.247
but I also, finally, understood.

00:54.674 --> 00:57.709
That... Willa had
put Mr. Rabbit out there,

00:57.744 --> 01:00.528
knowing that the ice was thin. That...

01:00.714 --> 01:03.114
even if she was watching,
she wouldn't pull me out.

01:04.379 --> 01:05.654
That she hated me.

01:06.864 --> 01:08.186
Now I know why.

01:08.369 --> 01:11.255
I remember when you came home
from the hospital, Wave.

01:12.048 --> 01:13.934
I picked out your name myself.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.227
You know they wanted
to call you Welcome?

01:16.525 --> 01:19.163
Welcome Earp, think about that!

01:20.337 --> 01:22.720
God, I tried so hard,

01:23.072 --> 01:25.436
but nobody ever celebrated my birthday,

01:25.915 --> 01:28.727
or... ordered copies
of my school photos,

01:29.673 --> 01:32.079
...noticed my report cards.

01:32.868 --> 01:34.757
Mama used to call you her angel.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.357
Mama left.

01:37.693 --> 01:39.651
And Daddy wouldn't even look at me.

01:40.412 --> 01:42.887
I don't know.
Maybe because I wasn't his.

01:43.372 --> 01:45.774
I didn't realize
how hard it was for you.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.458
But it doesn't mean you're not an Earp!

01:48.493 --> 01:50.016
Come on,

01:50.884 --> 01:52.797
or you're going to be late
for your appointment.

01:52.832 --> 01:55.199
- W... Waverly!
- What?

01:55.306 --> 01:57.502
Who did pull you out... of the ice?

01:58.642 --> 02:00.256
You did.

02:06.013 --> 02:07.712
Well now,

02:07.857 --> 02:11.148
it's an awfully cold day to be
stranded this far out of town.

02:11.213 --> 02:12.648
What seems to be the trouble?

02:16.926 --> 02:18.418
You are.

02:18.536 --> 02:20.625
I put you and your sister in a box.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.427
We got out.

02:22.595 --> 02:26.230
So, Juan Carlo...
where is the last seal?

02:26.414 --> 02:28.188
I'll die before I tell you.

02:28.408 --> 02:31.242
Oh, Padre... you'll do both.

03:03.579 --> 03:05.513
What?

03:05.609 --> 03:07.271
- Just enjoying the view.
- Hmm!

03:07.307 --> 03:11.269
Well, you can enjoy much more
of it if you come upstairs.

03:11.411 --> 03:14.445
Tempting. Extremely tempting.

03:14.574 --> 03:17.120
But I have an important errand
I must attend to.

03:18.630 --> 03:20.780
You don't have
to explain yourself to me.

03:20.874 --> 03:23.522
- I have my own plans.
- Do any of them

03:23.591 --> 03:26.413
involve spending time
with the Earp Sisters?

03:28.637 --> 03:30.107
That could be problematic.

03:30.141 --> 03:33.479
Wynonna is in my life, Rosita.
As are you, make no mistake.

03:33.504 --> 03:36.446
But it would help if there
wasn't a divide between my lover

03:36.482 --> 03:38.749
- and my...
- Baby mama? Alleged baby mama?

03:38.784 --> 03:40.851
I was gonna say friend.

03:41.943 --> 03:45.713
Wynonna is... fun.

03:45.939 --> 03:48.309
And Waverly, everybody loves Waverly!

03:48.560 --> 03:50.560
I told you I would protect you.

03:50.596 --> 03:52.496
But if I'm not here...

03:52.874 --> 03:55.375
If I'm so important, why won't
you tell me where you're going?

03:55.613 --> 03:57.345
Salt flats.

03:57.436 --> 03:59.261
Don't wait up.

04:06.846 --> 04:09.446
- Are you getting enough sleep?
- Uh...

04:09.482 --> 04:12.382
- Yeah. Naps are my bitch.
- Taking your vitamins?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.890
Wash 'em down each morning
with a rum and a Coke.

04:16.721 --> 04:18.488
Minus the rum.

04:18.684 --> 04:20.450
And the Coke.

04:20.475 --> 04:22.192
This isn't a joke, Wynonna.

04:22.228 --> 04:25.128
You're growing a human being. A person.

04:25.230 --> 04:27.237
Right. And that...

04:29.969 --> 04:33.150
A DNA test can determine
what kind, right?

04:33.175 --> 04:34.738
I thought we decided against that.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.807
No, it's... it's for a friend.

04:36.842 --> 04:38.909
She's... wondering where she came from.

04:40.679 --> 04:42.975
Thinks she's...
she was... adopted. Maybe.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.249
And is that something on your mind?

04:45.284 --> 04:48.148
- Adoption?
- No.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.296
I mean...

04:50.623 --> 04:52.256
not "no". I mean, I know...

04:52.291 --> 04:54.858
Know that you have options?
Because you do.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.995
There it is.

04:58.030 --> 05:00.402
Your partner in crime.

05:00.707 --> 05:02.440
Would you like
to see your baby, Wynonna?

05:06.633 --> 05:09.445
What the? What are you
trying to pull, man?

05:09.547 --> 05:11.256
Don't trick me!

05:11.281 --> 05:13.824
I didn't mean to spook you.
It's just that... you only have

05:13.849 --> 05:16.308
- a few weeks left. You need to...
- You need to!

05:16.333 --> 05:18.982
OK? I don't need to,
you need to! I don't... I can't.

05:19.169 --> 05:22.386
You absolutely can, if you want to.

05:22.708 --> 05:24.388
Just remember, you're deciding for two.

05:25.362 --> 05:26.556
OK.

05:26.581 --> 05:28.298
Did you want to know the sex?

05:33.455 --> 05:34.754
I'll see you next week.

05:37.536 --> 05:39.536
Hey! How'd it...

05:39.942 --> 05:41.271
go?

05:41.409 --> 05:43.442
- Deputy Marshal Dolls.
- Yes?

05:43.584 --> 05:45.609
Kidnap any more medical
professionals lately?

05:45.726 --> 05:47.593
In case she changes her mind.

05:47.618 --> 05:50.469
- Right. - It's confidential.
- Awesome, thanks.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.024
Dolls!

05:53.719 --> 05:56.053
Earp? Earp?!

06:05.525 --> 06:08.243
Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff!

06:08.337 --> 06:09.742
Sheriff! Sheriff!

06:09.767 --> 06:12.401
Ho! That's enough with the shouting.

06:12.436 --> 06:14.236
This ain't no Ed Sheeran concert.

06:14.272 --> 06:16.572
Listen, I need you to run me
a plate right now.

06:16.607 --> 06:18.274
A license plate off of a truck.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.300
I'm aware of what a plate is,
Deputy Marshal.

06:20.344 --> 06:23.812
Juliet Zero Six,
Hotel Five Echo. Run it now.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.822
- Nothing.
- That's impossible.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.589
- It's not in the system.
- OK. Well, try again!

06:33.624 --> 06:35.370
Or we could try this:

06:35.437 --> 06:36.854
did you catch a make? Model?

06:36.879 --> 06:38.596
The kind of music that
was playing on the radio?

06:38.631 --> 06:41.340
Black Dodge Ram,
2015, red neck screeching.

06:41.365 --> 06:43.966
It was 2017, it was ebony, not black,

06:44.001 --> 06:46.368
and that would've been Willie
Nelson, so watch your mouth.

06:46.771 --> 06:48.904
Rig belongs to Juan Carlo.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.607
Juan Carlo.

06:51.068 --> 06:53.642
- Juan Carlo kidnapped Wynonna.
- Highly doubt it.

06:53.688 --> 06:55.955
He's more good Samaritan
than he is dipshit.

06:56.299 --> 06:58.614
Though we'll have to ask him why
his plates aren't registered.

06:58.745 --> 07:01.584
Listen, sheriff. I need to find him.

07:01.706 --> 07:04.954
Well, you know Juan Carlo.
He's kind of a wily one.

07:04.989 --> 07:08.351
He's a loner. And he's chief
of the volunteer fire brigade.

07:08.376 --> 07:10.426
Really helps to keep
those young bucks in order.

07:11.376 --> 07:12.928
Did you just say "the Order"?

07:14.944 --> 07:17.478
- Nailed it.
- You're lucky nobody saw that.

07:17.976 --> 07:19.468
You saw it.

07:19.503 --> 07:21.837
Hey, well, I know
why you are distracted.

07:23.630 --> 07:25.976
Waves, Wynonna remembers you
coming home from the hospital.

07:26.001 --> 07:27.710
OK? So who are you gonna trust more,

07:27.806 --> 07:31.986
your sister or a sociopathic revenant
in a fuzzy coat?

07:32.113 --> 07:34.392
Well, I'm hoping I won't
have to trust either.

07:34.733 --> 07:35.932
I sent in a sample.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.919
Results should show
at the Cop Shop soon.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.291
I didn't want them
going to the Homestead,

07:42.333 --> 07:44.066
- though it hardly matters now.
- Of course it matters.

07:44.622 --> 07:47.895
- I haven't seen anything.
- OK.

07:48.114 --> 07:50.432
I mean, besides, are you
sure you really wanna know?

07:50.982 --> 07:53.702
No! But if I'm not an Earp, I have to.

07:54.139 --> 07:56.248
In the meantime...

07:57.219 --> 08:01.204
- why don't you distract me?
- Oh!

08:01.345 --> 08:03.587
Just the ladies I'm looking for.

08:03.852 --> 08:07.248
So, I had an idea. About your sister.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.440
I think we should
throw her a baby shower.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.450
- Seriously?
- I'll mix up some tequila

08:11.475 --> 08:13.867
adjacent mocktails.
Hell, maybe even get a damn piñata.

08:13.903 --> 08:15.762
Well, she does enjoy whacking things.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.043
Henry mentioned
that she's having trouble

08:18.068 --> 08:19.707
seeing this baby as a blessing.

08:19.828 --> 08:21.644
I just want to help.

08:21.830 --> 08:25.496
You know Waves, that is not
the craziest idea in the whole world.

08:25.659 --> 08:27.769
And it'll show Wynonna
that we're here for her, right?

08:28.036 --> 08:29.480
"We"?

08:29.723 --> 08:32.379
OK, so what's the cover
for the... surprise?

08:32.629 --> 08:33.774
Nachos.

08:33.942 --> 08:35.855
She'd never say no to nachos.

08:36.244 --> 08:39.611
Girls-nothing-special nacho night it is.

08:40.881 --> 08:42.715
I'll get on it.

08:43.585 --> 08:45.018
OK.

08:46.822 --> 08:48.855
Guess we're doing this.

08:49.819 --> 08:51.684
We. Huh.

08:54.186 --> 08:56.052
You're not handcuffed.

08:56.825 --> 08:58.631
Nedley said this was a courtesy call.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.900
- Yeah, well, it's not.
- Right. Uh...

09:00.912 --> 09:03.223
- Juan Carlo kidnapped Wynonna.
- Oh.

09:03.248 --> 09:04.386
Yeah.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.213
Snatched her right out
of the doctor's parking lot.

09:06.324 --> 09:08.808
Do you have any idea
why he would do that?

09:08.879 --> 09:11.110
- Juan Carlo thinks Wynonna's special.
- Yeah. She is.

09:11.146 --> 09:13.780
Right. Yeah. uh...
I've also seen her fight before.

09:13.815 --> 09:16.015
So, you know there's no way
she goes with him

09:16.051 --> 09:17.129
against her own will.

09:17.154 --> 09:20.355
Besides, Juan Carlo is incapable of
forcing anybody to do anything.

09:20.445 --> 09:22.645
This is bad. Ewan, right?

09:22.791 --> 09:24.757
Really bad. And it's only

09:24.793 --> 09:27.026
going to get worse for you
if you don't decide to help me.

09:27.062 --> 09:28.761
- Oh.
- Because Earp is...

09:28.797 --> 09:30.697
Calling... you.

09:30.924 --> 09:32.357
On your... on your phone right now.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.604
Earp?

09:36.605 --> 09:38.539
- Wassup?
- "Wassup"?

09:38.749 --> 09:40.917
Wassup is that you got taken!
I chased a truck!

09:40.942 --> 09:42.786
There was blood on the pamphlets!

09:42.811 --> 09:45.011
Oh, yeah. I got in a killer right hook.

09:45.206 --> 09:47.675
Before JC explained himself.

09:47.949 --> 09:50.617
Prenatal vitamins, Dolls.
I feel like a mountain lion.

09:50.652 --> 09:52.393
Are you OK?

09:52.418 --> 09:55.221
Juan Carlo just has some things
he wants to discuss with me.

09:55.259 --> 09:56.858
Wynonna, where are you right now?

09:56.883 --> 09:59.334
Uh... We're at a cross-roads,

09:59.453 --> 10:01.740
we've reached a communion...

10:01.811 --> 10:03.920
Jesus Christ's country house!

10:04.354 --> 10:06.283
That wasn't my best work.

10:06.338 --> 10:08.538
Well, it was cute.

10:09.079 --> 10:13.182
Still, I imagine it'll be hard
even for Agent Dolls

10:13.275 --> 10:15.122
to find this place.

10:15.224 --> 10:17.770
Country house. She's at a church.

10:18.575 --> 10:20.947
Is he gonna
creepy Vegas marry her or what?!

10:20.982 --> 10:23.216
I have no idea. Am I free to go now? OK?

10:23.251 --> 10:25.051
You really don't care
about any of this, do you?

10:25.093 --> 10:27.727
Wynonna, the seals,
these aren't our fight.

10:27.756 --> 10:28.955
The Order has been tasked to protect

10:28.980 --> 10:31.791
the Ghost River Triangle
from demons. Period.

10:31.826 --> 10:33.359
What the hell do you think my team and I

10:33.395 --> 10:34.587
have been doing this entire time, huh?

10:34.612 --> 10:36.712
Any word from Black Badge lately?

10:37.065 --> 10:39.009
Eventually you and your boys

10:39.167 --> 10:41.224
are going to have to get
in the game, because neutral men

10:41.249 --> 10:44.084
are the devil's allies. And brother...

10:46.178 --> 10:47.577
....the devil's coming.

10:50.506 --> 10:52.996
Highway 62, there's an abandoned chapel.

10:53.098 --> 10:55.415
It's right near Juan Carlo's chop shop.

10:55.450 --> 10:58.380
Enjoy your righteousness
and your protein shakes.

11:05.278 --> 11:09.214
Waverly wants you to join her
at Shorty's for nachos.

11:09.268 --> 11:12.031
Oh! Sounds good. I just gotta...

11:16.705 --> 11:19.038
Thought we've done this dance before.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.241
You know I'm not a bad guy.

11:23.034 --> 11:25.034
And you got into my truck...

11:25.130 --> 11:26.607
after you decked me.

11:26.661 --> 11:29.882
You said you have answers.
About the venomous vixens.

11:29.918 --> 11:32.085
- I do.
- Then... tell me.

11:32.226 --> 11:35.154
I can't. I mean, literally.

11:35.190 --> 11:37.957
It is my burden. My curse.

11:38.312 --> 11:41.898
To survive, and witness.
Never to decide.

11:41.981 --> 11:43.647
But you...

11:43.706 --> 11:45.156
Wynonna Earp.

11:45.443 --> 11:48.382
You're all choices. I can show you

11:48.453 --> 11:51.204
what you want to know,
but you must go willingly.

11:53.649 --> 11:56.495
Whoomp, there it is.
The illusion of free will.

11:56.664 --> 11:58.643
Go, into the church,

11:58.776 --> 12:01.557
with his gun... and this.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.537
Wyatt's badge?

12:04.722 --> 12:07.754
Place them in the center
of the mark I have made.

12:07.955 --> 12:09.553
And read the words.

12:09.713 --> 12:11.446
Now, before the sun sets.

12:12.709 --> 12:15.686
Or... you know, don't.

12:15.780 --> 12:18.453
- Dolls is on his way.
- I have no doubt.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.909
Will I be back before nacho night?

12:21.027 --> 12:23.885
The Earp sisters will be
reunited before sundown.

12:25.418 --> 12:27.178
This seems fruity, even for you.

12:27.364 --> 12:29.998
What do you have to fear, Wynonna?

12:30.260 --> 12:32.059
With Peacemaker at your side?

12:33.604 --> 12:35.437
So, this little ritual will show me

12:35.472 --> 12:38.149
how to stop the Widows
before they find the third seal?

12:38.219 --> 12:39.908
Oh, Ms. Earp...

12:40.342 --> 12:42.678
it'll show you a shitload.

13:00.195 --> 13:03.253
Spoiler alert: definitely
not gonna be a virgin birth.

13:04.468 --> 13:06.735
Blink twice if I'm being suckered.

13:08.163 --> 13:09.671
What the hell.

13:15.823 --> 13:18.975
I have ears, let me hear.

13:19.054 --> 13:21.436
I have eyes, let me see.

13:21.561 --> 13:23.600
I claim my birthright,

13:24.077 --> 13:25.651
I claim my history.

13:33.614 --> 13:35.064
And, I'm chanting like an asshole.

13:35.169 --> 13:36.798
Thanks for nothing, JC.

13:37.169 --> 13:39.214
Not you, other one.

13:39.503 --> 13:42.659
I hope Waverly didn't order
extra olives again.

13:42.768 --> 13:44.339
Is nothing sacred?

13:44.641 --> 13:49.124
So, funny story.
I was at the doctor's office...

13:49.210 --> 13:50.445
Doc...

13:51.233 --> 13:53.717
I promise it won't get gross this time.

13:54.085 --> 13:56.017
Ooh, though I did read

13:56.096 --> 13:58.760
a graphic pamphlet about skin tags.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.025
Hello?

14:15.005 --> 14:16.448
Wait...

14:17.471 --> 14:19.474
Why do I smell horses?

14:20.594 --> 14:22.098
Where am I?

14:28.157 --> 14:31.086
Holy pioneer balls!

14:33.997 --> 14:35.964
When am I?

14:37.702 --> 14:40.067
Not even gonna put up a fight?

14:40.153 --> 14:41.676
- Doc.
- Well, I'm amenable to betting

14:41.701 --> 14:44.302
- horses and wives.
- Doc.

14:45.077 --> 14:46.732
Doc!

14:47.920 --> 14:49.678
I'm in a vision quest.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.333
A spiritual awakening

14:52.497 --> 14:56.822
and... walkabout,
if you will. General weirdness.

14:57.007 --> 14:59.064
Don't panic. Don't panic.

15:00.438 --> 15:02.498
Hey, gringo!

15:02.568 --> 15:03.967
Hey!

15:05.709 --> 15:07.170
Whoosh!

15:07.511 --> 15:09.511
Am I a ghost?

15:10.242 --> 15:12.046
Oh. Hey.

15:12.182 --> 15:14.218
Hold on in there, don't
go all <i> Sixth Sense</i> on me.

15:14.765 --> 15:16.713
One of us has to keep our shit together.

15:16.851 --> 15:18.584
Mr. Holliday?

15:20.352 --> 15:23.091
Mr. Doc Holliday?

15:23.772 --> 15:24.971
Bobo?

15:25.372 --> 15:27.491
Speak up, Spectacles.

15:27.724 --> 15:29.051
I met you yesterday.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.893
I was drunk yesterday.

15:31.093 --> 15:32.192
You're drunk today.

15:32.921 --> 15:34.787
I come from Wyatt.

15:35.316 --> 15:38.135
He received another letter.
It upset him.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.436
Wyatt Earp...

15:40.138 --> 15:42.134
doesn't get "upset."

15:42.553 --> 15:45.803
I once saw a knife blade
fly between his legs,

15:45.928 --> 15:48.845
graze his balls
and he did not so much as blink.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.824
He just filled
the would-be assassin with lead

15:52.003 --> 15:55.952
and hence, Killer Miller
became a dead Miller,

15:56.418 --> 15:58.933
faster than you, sir...

15:59.457 --> 16:00.724
can draw.

16:00.955 --> 16:03.111
Not that I would expect

16:03.262 --> 16:05.262
a little mouse like you

16:05.791 --> 16:07.924
to know the butt end of a pistol

16:08.228 --> 16:10.767
from his own furry ass.

16:16.044 --> 16:18.055
What did you say your name was again?

16:18.119 --> 16:20.444
Robert. Robert Svane.

16:21.001 --> 16:22.512
Well...

16:22.708 --> 16:24.216
Robert.

16:24.716 --> 16:27.417
When you have a message from Wyatt Earp

16:28.029 --> 16:29.974
for me...

16:31.036 --> 16:32.773
you tell it to me...

16:35.461 --> 16:37.085
...in a private.

16:37.625 --> 16:38.933
The letter...

16:39.064 --> 16:40.808
is from the Padre in Purgatory.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.899
The sheriff there is a madman.

16:43.340 --> 16:44.918
Unhinged.

16:45.479 --> 16:47.012
A terror upon its citizens.

16:47.086 --> 16:48.819
Wyatt...

16:50.562 --> 16:53.217
...wants you to ride with him
to Purgatory.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.380
Purgatory is a lost cause.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.021
For God sakes!

16:59.218 --> 17:00.550
Good, honest people are dying!

17:00.883 --> 17:04.836
I have been dying
since I been 14 years old.

17:05.022 --> 17:07.180
If God does exist,

17:07.425 --> 17:09.992
he does not care
about the likes of any of us.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.119
I have made my peace with Wyatt.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.936
Now you can go to Hell.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.758
For Wyatt, I would.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.209
I would ride to Hell and back
for him if need be.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.446
Used to be you would too.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.582
Good day, sir.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.200
Of course I don't have it yet.

17:51.970 --> 17:54.404
I'm also not really here.
So I could probably get shot

17:54.603 --> 17:56.373
and I would be OK.

17:56.501 --> 17:59.442
Unless... if you die in your
dream, do you die in real life?

17:59.689 --> 18:01.806
What do I do?

18:04.462 --> 18:06.362
Make a damn choice.

18:08.868 --> 18:11.296
Thanks a bunch, Juan Carlo!

18:14.202 --> 18:16.844
Tacos are tasty! Tacos are tasty!

18:19.565 --> 18:22.465
You are sure that it
was Wyatt Earp? The Wyatt Earp?

18:22.490 --> 18:24.534
Dead certain. He shot Sheriff Clootie

18:24.570 --> 18:26.069
through the heart and then he
threatened something.

18:26.104 --> 18:27.604
It sounded awful.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.719
Say, a curse dooming Wyatt's descendants

18:29.744 --> 18:31.908
to a life of demon hunting
and surprisingly ch...

18:31.944 --> 18:33.543
ch... chilly vision quests?

18:33.571 --> 18:35.405
Earp rode off
this morning like the devil was

18:35.430 --> 18:36.993
- at his heels.
- Went off to see

18:37.018 --> 18:38.743
- a dying friend, I hear.
- Clootie's three wives

18:38.768 --> 18:40.453
are kicking up a real fuss
over that demon's body.

18:40.478 --> 18:42.786
Yeah, well, those devil
ladies are the Padre's problem now.

18:42.811 --> 18:44.354
If he don't drink himself to death,

18:44.389 --> 18:45.717
they'll probably eat him alive.

18:45.742 --> 18:47.889
Well, I'll be gone long before then.

18:49.338 --> 18:51.138
So this is where it all began.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.573
But where does it end?

19:33.472 --> 19:36.072
I don't get it. You were Wyatt's friend.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.408
What happened?

19:42.655 --> 19:45.048
I should have known you two had
something to do with the curse.

19:45.083 --> 19:48.685
<i>Szikla és fold lesz kotve,
még mindig, legyen ko!</i>

19:48.975 --> 19:51.856
- Constance Clootie?
- Turns out being paralyzed

19:51.881 --> 19:54.365
doesn't feel very nice... does it?

19:54.514 --> 19:57.560
Ooh, snap! We have to come
to church more often.

19:57.606 --> 19:59.042
<i>Where's our husband?</i>

19:59.067 --> 20:02.098
Sheriff Clootie's dead.
You'll never find him.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.350
- <i>Liar!</i>
- Oh, he's as good as dead.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.468
Buried in the earth.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.304
Funny, isn't it?

20:07.804 --> 20:09.928
He loved me best because of my magic,

20:10.069 --> 20:12.452
and now my magic will doom the bastard.

20:12.522 --> 20:14.380
- <i>Traitor!</i>
- Bitch.

20:14.405 --> 20:16.079
Father Juan Carlo.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.381
Now that the introductions
are out of the way...

20:23.837 --> 20:26.993
I don't wanna get technical,
but that looked like interference to me.

20:28.337 --> 20:29.860
Did you hear back from her?

20:29.970 --> 20:32.729
I've set the trap with beef
and cheese on tortilla chips.

20:32.764 --> 20:34.497
She'll be here.

20:34.718 --> 20:37.801
You think she's gonna
like all this, or...

20:38.085 --> 20:40.203
She'll pretend not to.

20:41.212 --> 20:43.280
A whole lotta piñata!

20:43.308 --> 20:46.209
Are we gonna bash that? It's... a baby!

20:46.244 --> 20:49.288
Yes! And this is a baby bash.

20:49.408 --> 20:51.158
It's filled with donuts.

20:51.301 --> 20:53.483
I stand a zillion percent corrected.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.682
Wynonna will love it.

20:56.488 --> 20:59.189
Wait until you see the mocktail list.

21:00.908 --> 21:02.271
So...

21:02.408 --> 21:04.241
she's being real friendly
all of a sudden.

21:04.332 --> 21:06.734
Yeah. She seems to have
gotten over the whole

21:06.828 --> 21:10.133
Wynonna-may-be-carrying-
her-boyfriend's-kid thing.

21:10.605 --> 21:13.292
But... good for her.

21:13.336 --> 21:14.792
'Cause like it or not,

21:14.855 --> 21:16.740
you guys are all
kind of in this together.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.812
Well, she's hardly said
one word to me before today.

21:18.837 --> 21:21.378
Well, hey! Maybe she's intimidated, OK?

21:21.517 --> 21:24.214
You Earps are a party
that's tough to crash.

21:24.455 --> 21:27.031
It's hard not to feel like an outsider,
even for me.

21:27.056 --> 21:30.911
I'm the nicest person in Purgatory!
There was a vote. I got a sash!

21:31.436 --> 21:33.042
OK. Well, all I'm saying

21:33.067 --> 21:35.834
is I remember what it feels like
to be new.

21:35.926 --> 21:39.244
And... I wasn't sleeping with
Wynonna's baby daddy, so...

21:39.534 --> 21:40.697
Hey.

21:41.791 --> 21:43.500
Well, that would have been
awkward on a lot of levels.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.702
Yeah.

21:45.737 --> 21:48.238
OK. I promise to try.

21:49.159 --> 21:50.874
Pregatini?

21:51.761 --> 21:52.828
Sure.

21:53.081 --> 21:55.578
Why not? This baby isn't
going to bash itself.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.348
Do you mind if I...
cock-up these mocktails?

21:58.499 --> 22:00.283
Please. Cock away.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.599
All of it.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.458
10-4. I like this Waverly.

22:21.517 --> 22:23.427
I don't need a gun to rip you apart.

22:23.541 --> 22:25.775
I know you don't, Deputy Marshal.

22:26.151 --> 22:27.911
Where is she
and what did you do with her?

22:28.082 --> 22:30.847
She's a willing participant
that's the way it has to be.

22:32.099 --> 22:35.385
You do recall who brought you
back to Purgatory

22:35.420 --> 22:38.254
- when you were half dead.
- Open the door!

22:38.347 --> 22:39.956
It's not locked, sport.

22:40.042 --> 22:41.972
And though her body lies in the chapel,

22:41.997 --> 22:43.893
Wynonna's no longer in our time.

22:44.441 --> 22:46.362
You drugged a pregnant woman?

22:46.398 --> 22:48.616
She and the baby are fine.

22:48.733 --> 22:51.085
But she won't be if you wake her.

22:51.288 --> 22:53.295
Wrenching someone from a vision quest

22:53.330 --> 22:55.077
before they have completed their journey

22:55.102 --> 22:57.384
breaks their mind, or kills them.

22:57.409 --> 22:59.375
You know, all this bullshit
would be easier to swallow

22:59.411 --> 23:01.177
if you didn't reek of amaretto.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.947
What can I say? I got a sweet tooth.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.908
If you hurt her...

23:05.933 --> 23:07.861
She needs to see the past

23:07.886 --> 23:09.886
if we have any hope for a future.

23:35.242 --> 23:36.719
Hey,

23:36.942 --> 23:38.852
don't do anything stupid, OK?

23:39.031 --> 23:40.711
I'm here.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.660
Are you certain this is gonna hold?

23:50.695 --> 23:52.562
It would take a force
of nature to shatter it.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.731
Say, dynamite?

23:53.756 --> 23:56.208
I'm more worried about
your demon husband.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.568
And you.

23:57.966 --> 23:59.547
She knows.

23:59.614 --> 24:01.204
About the demon's sons.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.143
My... sons.

24:03.338 --> 24:05.440
<i>He will rise...</i>

24:09.953 --> 24:11.152
Shut the hell up!

24:11.307 --> 24:12.789
Yes, I know.

24:12.906 --> 24:16.232
Wyatt Earp killed my poor boys.

24:16.321 --> 24:18.454
He will pay for it.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.991
But I have priorities.

24:22.027 --> 24:24.494
Should my demon husband get free,

24:24.621 --> 24:26.465
it'll be me running for my life.

24:26.668 --> 24:28.831
His funeral is my freedom.

24:29.238 --> 24:31.401
We need more than earth
to hold him though.

24:31.558 --> 24:33.083
Do we have a choice?

24:33.163 --> 24:35.772
Pour this upon the talismans
have given you.

24:36.466 --> 24:38.804
The key is to use iron.

24:38.872 --> 24:40.574
Or silver.

24:40.845 --> 24:42.926
Or even something like...

24:43.448 --> 24:44.681
a wedding ring.

24:45.129 --> 24:46.716
Repeat the words I taught you,

24:46.751 --> 24:49.319
then add your blood.
Fresh from the vein.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.020
Hide your seal on a holy site

24:51.056 --> 24:53.595
and they'll keep him
locked away... forever.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.783
Holy shit, the seals!

24:56.027 --> 24:58.884
We need three magical seals
to keep Clootie in his tomb.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.720
We tell no one else where we put them.

25:00.745 --> 25:01.892
Even each other. That way...

25:01.917 --> 25:03.834
We can't turn traitor
and blow the whole thing to shit?

25:03.961 --> 25:05.368
Agreed.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.673
Help me up.

25:10.795 --> 25:12.803
We gotta get you home.

25:17.608 --> 25:20.173
When in doubt, follow the blonde.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.960
So, how long will it take?

25:32.361 --> 25:34.972
Time is not really my strong suit.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.394
Yeah, and you're not entirely human.

25:37.569 --> 25:39.495
Not for a while now.

25:39.956 --> 25:42.479
I was granted immortality

25:42.557 --> 25:44.112
like your friend, Doc,

25:44.198 --> 25:46.610
along with a few other perks.

25:46.798 --> 25:48.129
And some burdens.

25:48.206 --> 25:50.072
You know, you ever thought about

25:50.142 --> 25:52.548
sitting down with us over dinner?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.417
Explaining a few things?

25:54.681 --> 25:57.353
I'm not allowed to interfere.

25:57.673 --> 26:00.674
- This isn't interfering?
- Oh, indeed it is.

26:01.143 --> 26:04.694
But... at this point, I'm no longer
afraid of the consequences.

26:05.385 --> 26:07.191
The almond smell...

26:07.360 --> 26:09.055
it's not amaretto.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.125
It's gangrene.

26:13.371 --> 26:14.871
Fatal, I'm afraid.

26:15.117 --> 26:16.672
Even for me.

26:16.833 --> 26:18.908
Listen, I can call my team, we can
get you to a hospital, alright?

26:18.943 --> 26:22.374
There's no time. She's here.

26:22.751 --> 26:24.702
Sooner than expected, damn her.

26:24.882 --> 26:27.241
She's looking for the third seal.

26:27.344 --> 26:29.153
I don't have it,
nor do I know where it is.

26:30.689 --> 26:31.821
Can you fight?

26:31.856 --> 26:33.122
Try and stop me.

26:34.710 --> 26:36.275
Dolls!

26:36.376 --> 26:40.212
Whatever happens to me,
don't let her get to Wynonna!

26:49.700 --> 26:53.012
<i>It's over. Step away
and you might be spared.</i>

26:53.155 --> 26:55.998
Jinx. I was gonna say the same thing.

26:56.191 --> 26:57.757
Except for the sparing part.

26:57.842 --> 26:59.613
<i>Wynonna Earp dies tonight.</i>

26:59.728 --> 27:01.427
You're gonna
have to go through me first.

27:01.523 --> 27:04.160
<i>That's the best invitation
I've had all day.</i>

27:04.517 --> 27:07.084
- <i>Come, sister.</i>
- What?

27:09.039 --> 27:10.804
And, I'm back in the chapel.

27:11.265 --> 27:12.839
Wyatt Earp...

27:18.008 --> 27:19.279
Angel?

27:19.602 --> 27:22.017
Hardly.

27:22.584 --> 27:24.250
Why are you here?

27:24.569 --> 27:26.263
This is a place of God.

27:26.444 --> 27:29.553
Oh, "I am made whole
in the house of my enemies."

27:29.803 --> 27:31.917
Have you been in Purgatory
all this time?

27:31.960 --> 27:33.825
Wyatt said he'd return...

27:34.629 --> 27:36.563
to see that all was set straight.

27:40.969 --> 27:43.203
How did you come by it?

27:43.238 --> 27:45.106
The wound?

27:46.215 --> 27:47.674
Your husband.

27:48.653 --> 27:50.643
Clootie didn't need a gun.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.728
Well, he held me as a shield,

27:52.853 --> 27:54.447
in between him and Wyatt.

27:54.924 --> 27:56.822
He was going to get away.

27:57.208 --> 27:59.330
I told Wyatt to take the shot.

27:59.455 --> 28:02.288
Bullet went straight through me
and into the demon's heart.

28:02.971 --> 28:04.924
You are a dear, brave friend.

28:05.845 --> 28:07.131
Not dear enough.

28:10.369 --> 28:11.832
"Robert,

28:11.926 --> 28:14.534
My travels are delayed once more..."

28:14.692 --> 28:17.206
- Doc Holliday's gone missing.
- Hmm.

28:17.442 --> 28:19.404
Wyatt's gone looking for him instead.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.865
Well, he does love John Henry,
doesn't he?

28:23.812 --> 28:26.271
But to choose him over you...

28:26.802 --> 28:28.748
Doc saved Wyatt's life.

28:29.653 --> 28:31.078
I just got in the way.

28:31.353 --> 28:33.286
And gave up your soul.

28:33.594 --> 28:35.296
What?

28:35.321 --> 28:37.102
This isn't fair. Don't tell him.

28:37.188 --> 28:39.325
Didn't you hear my husband's last words?

28:40.701 --> 28:43.035
That's what sent Wyatt Earp fleeing.

28:44.866 --> 28:46.740
Clootie cursed him.

28:47.269 --> 28:49.636
And all those killed by Peacemaker,

28:50.014 --> 28:51.994
...destined for hell.

28:52.674 --> 28:54.474
You're lying.

28:54.612 --> 28:56.009
She's not.

28:56.166 --> 28:58.244
They'll resurrect upon Wyatt's death.

28:58.440 --> 29:00.647
"Revenants" they'll be called.

29:01.687 --> 29:03.781
To hound and kill

29:03.859 --> 29:06.185
each and every Earp heir.

29:06.467 --> 29:09.689
And round and round it goes...

29:09.960 --> 29:11.405
Get out.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.330
You're going to be a demon, Robert.

29:13.428 --> 29:15.180
I am a good man!

29:15.205 --> 29:17.775
Hell burns that right out of you.

29:17.899 --> 29:19.499
I am a good man!

29:20.969 --> 29:23.027
Help me!

29:23.652 --> 29:25.910
Oh, please?

29:27.355 --> 29:28.973
There is a way.

29:30.207 --> 29:32.245
But you have to do something for me.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.247
What?

29:34.442 --> 29:37.114
Bring me the bones of my sons.

29:38.315 --> 29:40.471
- No.
- Good Bobo.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.623
Very well. Whatever they tell you...

29:43.751 --> 29:45.823
it's a dry heat.

29:46.720 --> 29:47.953
Alright, wait!

29:49.362 --> 29:50.731
So close.

29:54.768 --> 29:56.321
Whoa!

30:09.389 --> 30:11.288
<i>Well, now I'm hungry.</i>

30:11.342 --> 30:14.087
<i>You've tracked the prey. Now we feast.</i>

30:19.801 --> 30:22.505
Never have I ever
swam naked in the ocean.

30:22.763 --> 30:25.646
- Waverly?
- I've never even seen the ocean.

30:25.716 --> 30:27.434
Neither have I.

30:27.498 --> 30:28.935
You girls need to get out more.

30:28.970 --> 30:32.110
Mm. Why... why don't
we play pregnant Pictionary?

30:32.135 --> 30:35.306
Hm? Hope you're as good
at drawing a placenta as I am.

30:35.331 --> 30:37.353
Waves, grab a pen.

30:37.378 --> 30:39.645
- On it. I'm on it.
- "Waves"?

30:39.721 --> 30:41.293
Mm!

30:41.558 --> 30:44.869
Rosie's so much fun. I'm really
happy for her and Doc.

30:45.762 --> 30:47.086
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

30:48.386 --> 30:51.020
- Oh, uh... just, well... uh...
- This is your purse.

30:51.159 --> 30:52.989
Yeah.

30:53.128 --> 30:56.062
But this is my DNA test.

30:56.459 --> 30:58.365
You said it hadn't arrived yet.

31:01.069 --> 31:02.568
Well, have you... have you opened it?

31:04.787 --> 31:06.572
Why wouldn't you tell me?

31:07.036 --> 31:09.486
- Because I love you.
- Are you serious right now?

31:09.520 --> 31:11.644
Because I was trying to protect you.

31:11.723 --> 31:13.146
Or... control me.

31:13.894 --> 31:15.941
Once you look,
you can't unsee the result.

31:16.145 --> 31:18.551
I don't need you
to make decisions for me.

31:18.723 --> 31:22.121
OK? I'm not a child, Nicole.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.825
From the look on your face,
I'm not an Earp either.

31:27.262 --> 31:30.663
- Waverly, wait!
- Don't follow me.

31:33.833 --> 31:35.766
Who doesn't like Pictionary?

31:41.181 --> 31:43.114
Feels familiar...

31:43.259 --> 31:44.806
How much further?

31:45.524 --> 31:48.358
Come. Your answers lie in the depths.

31:49.717 --> 31:51.525
Hello?

31:51.853 --> 31:54.220
- Hello?!
- Well that's...

31:54.316 --> 31:56.636
- Doc.
- Holliday. Please.

31:57.699 --> 32:00.332
- If you can hear me, I need help!
- What did you do?

32:01.903 --> 32:05.031
I desire vengeance on Wyatt Earp
for the death of my boys.

32:05.106 --> 32:06.966
His best friend...

32:07.013 --> 32:09.647
alive forever at the bottom
of a pit does the trick.

32:09.737 --> 32:11.804
You should have seen his face
when I pushed him in.

32:13.074 --> 32:14.767
Why bring me here?

32:15.079 --> 32:17.510
- To wallow in your savagery?
- The ring you want?

32:17.610 --> 32:20.725
The one that heals the dying
and delays death interminably...

32:20.788 --> 32:22.577
is also my seal.

32:23.732 --> 32:25.279
And it's in the well?

32:25.398 --> 32:27.342
Well, it seemed like
a good place to hide it,

32:27.475 --> 32:30.731
on the finger of the best
gunslinger alive.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.019
You rescue him,

32:32.183 --> 32:34.370
get it back, avoid demon-dom...

32:34.903 --> 32:37.172
And Doc and Wyatt will be reunited.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.565
They'll be thrilled!

32:40.902 --> 32:44.237
Or... I trust you'll
make the right choice.

32:46.079 --> 32:47.619
That's a neat trick.

32:48.517 --> 32:49.787
Please, whoever you are,

32:49.882 --> 32:51.911
I'm in dire need of your assistance!

32:52.607 --> 32:53.864
You have a ring.

32:54.046 --> 32:56.649
- Made of silver.
- Do I know you, friend?

32:58.672 --> 33:00.980
Oh, no. We're not friends.

33:01.251 --> 33:02.955
Now, you tie that ring

33:03.220 --> 33:04.360
to this thread.

33:04.508 --> 33:05.783
And once I have it,

33:05.900 --> 33:07.134
I will throw you down a rope.

33:15.556 --> 33:19.046
I am much obliged, sir,
but I would much rather be free first.

33:19.285 --> 33:20.751
You have my word.

33:25.847 --> 33:28.575
What good is the word
of a man I do not know!?

33:30.285 --> 33:32.434
You would rather stay in the dark

33:32.587 --> 33:34.450
than give up your immortality?

33:34.779 --> 33:36.622
Well, hell. That is the devil's work.

33:36.721 --> 33:39.049
Well then throw down
the rope or go to Hell!

33:40.549 --> 33:42.369
I believe I will.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.555
Hello?

33:47.669 --> 33:49.875
Hey! Please come back!

33:50.216 --> 33:52.047
Come back!

33:52.941 --> 33:54.555
Please!

33:54.758 --> 33:57.836
You will retrieve the bones
of my sons, eventually.

33:57.912 --> 33:59.745
You don't get it.

34:00.030 --> 34:01.714
You don't have anything I want!

34:02.491 --> 34:04.050
I'll find something.

34:28.219 --> 34:29.953
<i>Impossible!</i>

34:33.357 --> 34:35.224
Dolls...

35:06.116 --> 35:07.749
Wynonna...

35:07.879 --> 35:09.649
Now would be a good time to wake up.

35:11.886 --> 35:13.621
It burns!

35:25.049 --> 35:27.830
<i>Damn him! He has claimed sanctuary.</i>

35:27.975 --> 35:29.836
<i>Get the torch.</i>

35:31.722 --> 35:35.304
<i>Church or brothel, house or barn.</i>

35:35.453 --> 35:37.195
<i>These houses of men.</i>

35:37.293 --> 35:39.937
<i>In the end, they all burn.</i>

35:45.228 --> 35:46.775
Though I walk through the valley

35:46.876 --> 35:48.752
of the shadow of death,

35:49.310 --> 35:51.615
I will fear no evil,

35:52.179 --> 35:54.552
for you are with me.

36:05.450 --> 36:07.617
You are with me.

36:07.856 --> 36:09.662
How can you see me?

36:09.783 --> 36:11.850
I suppose because I'm dying.

36:13.703 --> 36:16.326
Though I've caught
glimpses of you my entire life.

36:18.928 --> 36:20.607
I've been here awhile.

36:20.749 --> 36:22.082
My guardian angel.

36:22.196 --> 36:24.264
Something like that.

36:27.651 --> 36:29.101
<i>Wake up!</i>

36:29.710 --> 36:31.647
I've been a good man.

36:32.173 --> 36:34.507
I deserve to be saved. I do.

36:34.618 --> 36:36.619
- You left Doc down there.
- No.

36:36.644 --> 36:38.054
Alone...

36:38.343 --> 36:40.085
- forever.
- I had to.

36:40.214 --> 36:43.058
He was guarding something
precious. It needs to stay safe.

36:43.184 --> 36:45.985
You were jealous
and you left him there to ro...

36:46.347 --> 36:48.042
to rot!

36:48.256 --> 36:51.201
Yeah. You're right. I confess.

36:51.407 --> 36:53.708
But it was a moment of weakness.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.637
And you're here with me now.

36:56.426 --> 36:57.840
My angel...

36:58.384 --> 37:00.050
here to save my soul.

37:00.234 --> 37:02.557
If you'd rescued Doc,

37:02.772 --> 37:05.330
everything might have
been different, Bobo.

37:05.549 --> 37:06.986
Bobo?

37:07.854 --> 37:11.210
Why are you calling me that?
My name is Robert.

37:11.374 --> 37:12.968
Bobo will be your name.

37:13.990 --> 37:16.131
When you're resurrected from Hell.

37:17.311 --> 37:18.851
As a demon.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.280
Peacemaker!

37:30.713 --> 37:32.045
I know that gun.

37:32.096 --> 37:33.896
It's the one that killed you.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.859
God, what did I do?

37:39.617 --> 37:41.726
What shall I become?

37:42.086 --> 37:45.860
Try... try to remember who you were.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.674
Remember...

37:49.050 --> 37:51.345
how much you loved...

37:51.953 --> 37:53.611
Wyatt Earp.

37:56.924 --> 37:59.638
Oh no! No, no, no!

37:59.702 --> 38:02.341
You're dying.
You're dying because of me!

38:02.651 --> 38:04.857
- No!
- Trust me.

38:05.066 --> 38:06.966
We'll meet again.

38:07.959 --> 38:09.827
If you're an angel,

38:10.014 --> 38:12.295
we're gonna be on different sides.

38:13.283 --> 38:15.007
I need to wake up.

38:16.892 --> 38:18.775
I promise I will never hurt you.

38:18.869 --> 38:21.847
No matter what form I take, I swear it.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.595
Alright? I swear I will never hurt you!

38:29.926 --> 38:31.726
What's my angel's name?

38:34.262 --> 38:36.026
Waverly.

38:37.845 --> 38:39.494
Waverly.

38:42.427 --> 38:44.314
I will remember.

38:45.259 --> 38:47.106
Please.

38:49.137 --> 38:51.087
Wake me up...

39:15.672 --> 39:17.345
Please be OK.

39:17.407 --> 39:19.759
Hey! Hey! You're hurt. Let me help.

39:19.885 --> 39:23.275
Be OK! Please! Please! Please!

39:23.377 --> 39:25.578
Come back to me! Come on!

39:25.613 --> 39:27.279
Oh! Oh!

39:27.315 --> 39:30.457
Oh! Yes! Oh! Yes!

39:30.762 --> 39:33.644
Oh, you're OK! You're OK!

39:33.780 --> 39:35.780
How did you find us?

39:35.910 --> 39:37.976
Smart move, ringing the bell.

39:38.059 --> 39:39.855
That wasn't me.

39:41.152 --> 39:42.902
It was Robert.

40:05.783 --> 40:08.242
<i>I'm here. I got you, Waverly.</i>

40:08.430 --> 40:11.145
<i>- Angel.
- Papa.</i>

40:29.189 --> 40:31.537
So, how was your vision quest?

40:32.161 --> 40:34.256
- The third seal?
- Yeah.

40:35.055 --> 40:36.649
It's Doc's ring.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.766
Constance Clootie's wedding ring.

40:40.649 --> 40:42.469
She gave it to Doc,

40:42.703 --> 40:45.797
- tied his immortality to it.
- That's pretty smart.

40:45.969 --> 40:47.899
Who's gonna rob a gunslinger, right?

40:48.031 --> 40:51.617
I also know what happens
if those bitches in black break it.

40:53.452 --> 40:55.204
Clootie, the demon who started

40:55.229 --> 40:57.375
this whole God damn story, will rise.

40:57.610 --> 40:59.079
And he will be pissy,

40:59.244 --> 41:01.883
given the whole buried alive thing.

41:06.208 --> 41:07.716
I'm fine.

41:07.988 --> 41:09.473
Good...

41:09.732 --> 41:11.356
'cause you kind of died.

41:11.575 --> 41:13.098
- Uh, what, what, what?
- Yeah.

41:13.267 --> 41:15.455
You weren't breathing, you
didn't have a pulse for like...

41:15.916 --> 41:17.635
77 seconds.

41:19.556 --> 41:21.198
- Wow.
- Yeah.

41:22.497 --> 41:24.879
- First time for everything.
- Just don't do it again.

41:24.904 --> 41:26.119
OK.

41:27.599 --> 41:29.140
I also saw Robert.

41:30.665 --> 41:32.090
Bobo.

41:32.603 --> 41:34.045
He was...

41:35.611 --> 41:38.983
"I am made whole
in the house of my enemies."

41:39.523 --> 41:41.976
"And my enemies are
made whole in my house."

41:43.187 --> 41:44.939
Is that how it goes?

41:45.304 --> 41:47.125
You didn't have Sunday school?

41:51.184 --> 41:53.384
If we live long enough...

41:56.610 --> 41:58.476
...we all become enemies.

42:00.250 --> 42:01.739
No.

42:02.992 --> 42:04.308
Not you and me.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.067
Never.

42:13.500 --> 42:15.767
Where you going?
No, no, come on. Not yet.

42:16.348 --> 42:18.467
The Earp heir, dead.

42:20.727 --> 42:22.860
But only for a few seconds
though, right?

42:22.896 --> 42:24.028
Yeah.
