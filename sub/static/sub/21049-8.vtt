WEBVTT

00:08.258 --> 00:09.259
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.303
-Hi, sweetie. How you doing?
-[Rooster] Great.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.971
Spent all day going from ranch to ranch.
There's no work anywhere.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.433
So then I just went to the DQ.

00:16.516 --> 00:20.145
-Oh, are they hiring?
-I don't know. I just wanted a dip cone.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.982
Sucks for you, man.
Me and Dad, we put in a hard eight hours,

00:25.067 --> 00:26.859
then we shared a beer and a hug.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.362
Bullshit.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.784
Well, I had a beer, and then Dad,
he brushed a bee off my shoulder.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.372
I mean, still, you don't brush a bee off
the shoulder of someone you don't love.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.501
Don't worry, honey.
You're gonna find somethin'.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.421
You really think that or just sayin' that
'cause you're my mom?

00:47.004 --> 00:48.506
Oh, look. Free beer!

00:53.095 --> 00:55.930
-Oh, hey, guys.
-Hey. What's up?

00:57.515 --> 01:00.685
-Who the hell's that?
-That's Heather. You used to date her.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.233
Not Heather. The guy.
[stammers] What is she, on a date?

01:06.899 --> 01:07.775
I don't know.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.695
What's a pregnant lady doing on a date?

01:13.490 --> 01:14.907
Oh, I know the answer to this one.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.409
"I don't give a fuck."

01:18.035 --> 01:20.037
I'm just saying, it's weird.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.999
No, what's weird is, later on tonight,

01:23.083 --> 01:26.043
that dude's dong is gonna be banging
into your baby's head.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.924
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:33.301 --> 01:34.761
Look, man, I'm just sayin'.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.555
Kid's gonna end up having as many
concussions as you before he's even born.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.352
Oh, hey, Heather. How you doin'?

01:42.435 --> 01:45.104
Hi, Maggie. Good.
Can I get a Bud and an iced tea?

01:45.188 --> 01:47.732
-Oh, sure. I'll bring it right out to you.
-Thanks.

01:47.815 --> 01:50.777
-Who's your friend?
-Paul.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.530
Paul? That's a weird name.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.991
Okay, Colt and Rooster.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.995
I've never seen him before. Is he new?

02:01.788 --> 02:05.082
Compared to my last boyfriend,
he's new and improved.

02:05.167 --> 02:08.170
[laughs] That's you, Colt.
Old and worse.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.840
Boyfriend, huh? You on a date?

02:13.508 --> 02:14.801
First date, actually.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.094
Must be a good guy.

02:17.762 --> 02:21.849
-Considering he knows you're--
-Pregnant? I told him.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.976
I was gonna say cat lady,
but that works, too.

02:25.437 --> 02:29.106
Hey, Heather, question.
Um, hypothetically speaking, right,

02:29.191 --> 02:31.651
if the baby saw somethin' comin' at it...

02:33.945 --> 02:36.323
could it, like, get out of the way?

02:38.115 --> 02:39.116
Bye, guys.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.708
-I can't believe she's on a date.
-Yeah. It's a tough one.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.710
Hey, who am I?

02:54.048 --> 02:56.050
[theme song playing]

03:57.862 --> 03:58.988
Dale?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.369
-Dale!
-[exclaims] What? Huh?

04:04.452 --> 04:06.037
-Oh, hey, Rooster.
-Hey.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.956
-[both chuckle]
-Got your, uh, hearing aids on there?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.751
Yeah. Let me turn these hearin' aids on.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.003
I gotta save the batteries, you know?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.798
Uh... uh, I don't want 'em to die
while I'm watching TV.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.007
-Yeah.
-Last week,

04:18.090 --> 04:20.635
I got all of  Law  and none of  Order.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.681
So, what are you doin' around here,
Rooster?

04:24.764 --> 04:27.141
Well, you know,
just driving by the neighborhood,

04:27.224 --> 04:29.226
figured I'd swing by and say what's up.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.647
Well, I guess you got
a lot of time on your hands

04:32.730 --> 04:35.232
since you got let go from Neumann's Hill.

04:35.317 --> 04:38.778
You heard about that, huh?
Well, you know...

04:39.821 --> 04:43.240
I told him I was gonna hire
my good friend Dale Rivers to be my vet,

04:43.325 --> 04:45.117
if they didn't like it,
to go ahead and fire me.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.871
I heard that you got put in jail
for a bar fight

04:48.955 --> 04:51.333
and for driving the company truck drunk.

04:53.209 --> 04:54.669
I mean, it's all kinda tied together.

04:57.046 --> 05:02.259
So look, uh, just wonderin' if you heard
of anybody looking for a hard-workin'...

05:02.344 --> 05:05.763
seasoned rancher who's got a sexy smile
and a badass head of hair.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.599
Oh, Colt's out of work too, huh?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.268
Well, you might try the Cranstons.

05:11.353 --> 05:17.274
I hear their, uh, youngest is gonna go,
uh, join the Cirque du Soleil.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.487
He always was a bendy little feller.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.991
Eddie, huh? Yeah, that makes sense.

05:25.074 --> 05:28.870
Most kids you had to shove into a locker,
but he'd just fold right up.

05:30.830 --> 05:34.626
Yeah, he don't go till next summer.
I'll put in a good word for you.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.419
[inhales deeply]

05:37.003 --> 05:39.381
Yeah, the thing is, Dale, is I'm...
[clears throat]

05:39.464 --> 05:41.298
...kinda lookin' for something now,
you know?

05:41.383 --> 05:44.386
Pretty strapped, and there's only
so many chicken fried steaks

05:44.469 --> 05:45.845
Mary can drop at the Cracker Barrel.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.264
Woo, boy,
I love them chicken fried steaks.

05:48.347 --> 05:49.348
Mmm-hmm.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.934
I think I'll take Charlene over there
for one this evenin'.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.520
We like to get there early

05:53.603 --> 05:56.981
so we can sit out on them rocking chairs
they got out front.

05:57.064 --> 06:01.318
Sit there long enough,
you get a real good workout in your core.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.448
Hey, Dale, can we focus up here?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.659
Oh, yeah. Work.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.120
Well, I don't know much, but, uh...

06:12.163 --> 06:14.791
I got some odd jobs around here
you could do in the meantime.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.375
I could pay you by the hour.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.421
I mean, yeah, Dale, that'd be great.
Thanks, I'll take it.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.506
[Charlene] Dale?

06:22.757 --> 06:27.386
-Uh, Dale, I think Charlene's callin' you.
-Oh. Yeah, I heard her, but, uh...

06:28.554 --> 06:30.723
-she don't need to know that.
-[clicks tongue]

06:36.604 --> 06:38.314
-Hey, Mr. Bennett.
-Hey, Abby.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.318
[chuckles] "Grumpy." Cute.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.447
I got a pair when I went
on a school trip in junior high.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.532
But I had mono, so mine say "Sleepy."

06:49.451 --> 06:50.827
Joanne got 'em for me.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.913
I haven't met Joanne yet.
Is she the one who calls Colt "shithead"?

06:53.996 --> 06:55.122
Yeah.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.918
-She's great.
-[chuckles]

06:59.001 --> 07:00.086
She's my friend.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.171
Well, it's good
to have friends. [chuckles]

07:02.254 --> 07:04.674
Yeah. We're friends.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.806
-Okay, did you wanna talk about somethin'?
-Well...

07:13.057 --> 07:16.978
the other night, Joanne and I
were together during that storm.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.813
And we...

07:21.441 --> 07:23.275
You're gonna make me say it, huh?

07:27.572 --> 07:28.823
Say what?

07:29.741 --> 07:31.743
-We kissed.
-Oh, my God.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.080
Oh, that is so adorable!

07:37.999 --> 07:39.876
-Don't do that.
-[softly] Sorry.

07:40.960 --> 07:45.297
Anyway... ever since then,
we haven't spoken.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.049
Wait, you didn't call her?

07:48.092 --> 07:51.596
I've always found
that my charming personality

07:51.679 --> 07:54.098
-doesn't come through over the phone.
-[chuckles]

07:57.685 --> 08:01.773
You know what? I'm really not comfortable
discussing these kind of things.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.567
Okay, that's all right.
We don't have to talk about it.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.486
I guess I feel that...

08:09.489 --> 08:13.159
if we start dating...
it's gonna ruin our friendship.

08:14.952 --> 08:15.953
Then I think...

08:17.204 --> 08:20.416
"What if we both want
more than a friendship?"

08:21.083 --> 08:25.838
Then I think, "I just got divorced.
Maybe I'm not ready for any of this."

08:27.006 --> 08:29.592
But again, I don't want to talk about it.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.722
You know, I see this every prom.

08:34.806 --> 08:39.811
Girls on one side, guys on the other side.
Everyone too scared to make a move.

08:40.394 --> 08:44.566
And then there's Miss Phillips
in the middle, doing the robot alone!

08:46.609 --> 08:48.027
[vocalizes]

08:51.155 --> 08:53.490
[in robotic voice]
You should talk to Joanne.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.911
I don't know.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.788
It's the only way to find out
what she's thinkin'.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.791
-Appreciate it, Abby.
-Oh, anytime, Mr. Bennett.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.877
If I ever need advice about Colt and me,
I'll come to you.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.546
I got some right now.

09:09.381 --> 09:12.051
-Break up with him and run.
-[chuckles]

09:14.095 --> 09:15.972
Hey. Oh, check it out.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.641
I filled up this old cup with snow
and I poured beer in it.

09:18.725 --> 09:19.767
It's a beer slushie.

09:23.855 --> 09:24.856
Run.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.443
-Hey, babe.
-Hey. How was your day?

09:29.526 --> 09:32.572
Good. Good.
Oh, hey, guess who I ran into at the bar?

09:33.615 --> 09:36.576
Heather.
She's on a date with some dude named Paul.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.454
Oh, my God. Paul?
Really? I had no idea.

09:41.288 --> 09:44.166
-You know this guy?
-Uh, yeah. He's the new math teacher.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.793
And wrestling coach.

09:46.460 --> 09:50.632
He brings donuts every Monday.
Those jelly ones are good as fuck.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.801
Oh!

09:53.885 --> 09:56.929
Anyway, bunch of teachers, we were
out for lunch, and Heather was there,

09:57.013 --> 09:59.724
so I introduced her to Paul,
but I had no idea that he asked her out.

09:59.807 --> 10:03.978
Why would you introduce them?
Wrestling coaches are pervy.

10:06.648 --> 10:10.652
Ask Rooster about Coach Jensen
and his advanced pinnin' techniques.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.113
Are you jealous?

10:14.196 --> 10:16.490
[stammers] No, I'm not jealous.
Why would you ask that?

10:16.573 --> 10:20.077
-So, then what's the big deal?
-The big deal is Heather's having my baby.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.328
And anyone she hangs out with

10:21.412 --> 10:23.539
is potentially gonna be hanging out
with my kid.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.249
I don't want my kid bein' a wrestler.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.544
Or good at math.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.381
Well, if it makes you feel better,

10:32.465 --> 10:34.717
I'm sure he'll wrestle with math.
[chuckles]

10:36.260 --> 10:38.554
-Paul's a good guy.
-Oh, yeah? Really?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.514
If he's a good guy,
why didn't she introduce me to him?

10:40.597 --> 10:44.101
-Maybe she thought you'd overreact.
-How would I overreact?

10:44.185 --> 10:46.354
I'm... What if this guy's a serial killer?

10:46.896 --> 10:49.774
Paul is not a serial killer.
You're making a big deal out of nothin'.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.318
[stammers] What kind of 30-year-old guy

10:52.401 --> 10:56.656
just moves to Garrison, Colorado out of
nowhere and starts datin' a 23-year-old?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.116
Uh, you did.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.082
Hey.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.462
You know what Mom wants
to talk to us about?

11:12.421 --> 11:14.548
-No clue.
-Really?

11:15.800 --> 11:16.968
Wait.

11:17.634 --> 11:18.803
Holy shit.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.305
Is this an intervention?

11:25.977 --> 11:29.230
-Did you break our pact?
-Uh, no. Did you?

11:29.313 --> 11:30.689
No. Like we said...

11:30.773 --> 11:32.649
[both] "Never be part
of the other person's intervention."

11:32.734 --> 11:34.276
All right, cool.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.946
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.280
Something I need to talk to you about--

11:38.364 --> 11:40.616
Mom, I'll take it from here.

11:40.699 --> 11:43.953
Rooster, your drinking
has affected me and... [laughs]

11:46.163 --> 11:48.707
That talk is coming, but not today.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.710
-[chuckles]
-Look, when you guys were little,

11:51.794 --> 11:54.505
if I bought one of you a toy,
I had to get the other one a toy.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.174
So, with that in mind,
Colt, I got you this.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.051
Oh! Thin Mints!

11:59.886 --> 12:02.221
And they're frozen! Fuck, yeah! [chuckles]

12:02.304 --> 12:04.181
I got you something, too, Rooster.

12:05.557 --> 12:06.600
I wanna give you the bar.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.477
What the fuck?

12:12.189 --> 12:14.859
Wait, what? What...
what are you talkin' about?

12:14.942 --> 12:16.903
Look, it's a simple proposal.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.905
You run the place
and we split the profits.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.447
That way, you have a steady job

12:20.531 --> 12:23.575
and I can, you know,
finally get out of here and travel.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.869
[stammers] Wait a second.

12:24.952 --> 12:28.998
First, you give Rooster the huntin' cabin
and now you're givin' him a job

12:29.081 --> 12:31.458
where he works at a bar
and he gets to drink all day?

12:32.709 --> 12:37.006
I have a job where I work with Dad
and I have to drink all day!

12:39.884 --> 12:41.718
Look, Colt, I'd do the same for you,

12:41.803 --> 12:44.638
but you don't need a job
or a place to live.

12:45.389 --> 12:48.559
Somehow you ended up
the son who's doing well.

12:51.603 --> 12:53.564
-[grunts]
-I don't know. I mean...

12:54.398 --> 12:57.484
could I really sell kids fake IDs
and then accept them?

12:59.778 --> 13:00.988
I believe I could.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.325
Look, Rooster,
your problem has always been

13:04.408 --> 13:06.410
that you don't like people
telling you what to do.

13:06.493 --> 13:09.538
I mean, when you were born,
the doctor slapped you to make you cry

13:09.621 --> 13:12.249
and you just laughed at him
and peed in his face.

13:14.501 --> 13:16.378
That would be pretty badass.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.007
Make my own rules
and don't even follow 'em.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.887
-Yeah. I'm startin' to like this.
-Yeah.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.806
I run the ranch, you run the bar...

13:27.890 --> 13:29.851
[stammers] Wait a second.
Let me try somethin'.

13:30.476 --> 13:34.021
"Rooster, give me a free whiskey."
Oh, yeah, I like... That's right.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.523
Actually, I got a new rule.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.317
Colt, from now on,
you pay for all your own drinks.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.526
Mom!

13:41.445 --> 13:42.905
I know this is a really big deal,

13:42.989 --> 13:45.241
so you just take your time
and think about it.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.079
I do love this place.
[chuckles] It's funny, huh?

13:50.162 --> 13:52.206
You think your mom might be
givin' you an intervention.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.916
Instead, she gives you a bar.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.753
Actually, now that I think of it,
and you guys are together,

13:57.836 --> 13:59.296
-maybe we should talk about...
-[Colt] I gotta go.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.257
-...you boys and your drinking and...
-[both mumbling]

14:08.389 --> 14:10.266
So, I'm glad you called.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.477
I didn't know
we were meetin' someplace so fancy.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.355
I know you're jokin'.

14:16.981 --> 14:20.317
But the split pea soup comes
with a piece of ham on top.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.987
-[chuckles]
-How are you doin'?

14:23.070 --> 14:25.489
-I'm pretty good. How are you?
-Good.

14:26.282 --> 14:30.411
I saw a Chevy on the way over here.
Thought maybe it was you.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.829
It wasn't.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.167
I thought I saw a Ford
on the way over here.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.752
Turned out to be just a dumpster
lyin' on its side.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.554
Are we just gonna...

14:48.637 --> 14:51.432
sit here awkwardly and not talk
about what happened the other night?

14:51.515 --> 14:52.808
No, no, uh...

14:53.893 --> 14:56.353
That's why I called.
I... I want to talk about it.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.604
Oh, good.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.447
-I'll go first? [chuckles]
-Great.

15:08.074 --> 15:13.454
Well... we had a few drinks
and it was a pretty night.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.331
And we kissed.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.999
At least I think we did.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.960
I'm not sure I made it
through your mustache.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.544
[chuckles]

15:20.627 --> 15:23.172
-And it was nice.
-Yeah, it was.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.969
-But I think we're better as friends.
-Ah, thank God.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.474
Well, uh, a tinge of disappointment
might have been nice.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.809
No, I... I think you're right.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.521
We've always had such a good time
together. I hate to screw it up.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.191
-Yeah, why ruin a good friendship?
-Exactly.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.610
-You and I are great as we are.
-Yep.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.613
-Ronald Reagan was a horrible president.
-What?

15:49.156 --> 15:51.533
Just checkin' to see if you're agreeing
with everything I say.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.953
Well, I wasn't.

15:54.036 --> 15:57.331
And Ronald Reagan was the best thing
to come out of California,

15:57.414 --> 15:59.291
besides the dancing raisins.

16:01.002 --> 16:04.421
Okay, so let's just go back
to where I stop by whenever I want to

16:04.505 --> 16:07.424
and I drink all your whiskey
and you try to trick me

16:07.508 --> 16:10.219
into watching some stupid
John Wayne movie.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.888
First you hit Reagan, and now the Duke?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.598
-That's two strikes.
-[Joanne scoffs]

16:14.681 --> 16:18.102
You take a shot at Peyton Manning,
you'll never see me again.

16:19.103 --> 16:22.731
Well, I'm not gonna take a shot,
but he's no John Elway.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.775
Now, just...

16:27.236 --> 16:28.529
You make a good point.

16:34.951 --> 16:38.414
Oh. Looks like someone got tickets
to the gun show.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.666
Unfortunately,
someone else got season passes.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.834
Bam! Bam! [chuckles]

16:44.003 --> 16:45.004
Can I help you?

16:45.087 --> 16:48.132
Oh. Sorry, you must not be
from around here.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.885
-Colt Bennett. I'm kind of a local legend.
-Okay.

16:51.968 --> 16:53.429
Uh, did you check in with the office?

16:53.512 --> 16:55.472
'Cause when strange adults
start hanging around schools

16:55.556 --> 16:57.266
talking about guns, it, uh...

16:57.349 --> 16:59.685
-Well, it sets off a bunch of alarms.
-[Colt] Yeah, yeah.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.770
I'm, uh... I'm Garrison alumni.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.315
Maybe you've seen my name on the wall?

17:04.398 --> 17:06.608
"Most passing yards. Bennett comma Colt.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.070
Most touchdowns. Bennett comma Colt.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.531
Highest completion percentage.
Thompson comma Josh." What the fuck?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.868
Bullshit stat anyway.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.330
[stammers] I'm sorry, why are you here?

17:19.413 --> 17:22.249
Oh, well, since I hold
all the most important records,

17:22.333 --> 17:24.043
they let me work out here sometimes.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.129
And my, uh... my girlfriend,
she works here. Abby Phillips.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.049
Yeah, yeah. No, I know Abby.
She's... she's awesome.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.925
Goes crazy for those jelly donuts, huh?

17:32.008 --> 17:34.928
-[chuckles] Well, I'm... I'm Paul Cutler.
-Oh.

17:35.011 --> 17:36.555
Wrestling coach and math teacher.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.975
So, I can teach you how to do
a half nelson or solve for x.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.727
[grunts] Wrestling, huh?

17:42.644 --> 17:45.814
You ever teach a boy
an advanced pinnin' technique?

17:46.773 --> 17:49.776
-I don't think I know what that is.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.989
What brings you to Garrison, Paul?

17:55.491 --> 17:59.911
Well, it's a long story, but, bottom line,
I just needed a change.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.247
Change, huh?

18:02.248 --> 18:03.332
You get into some trouble?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.960
-Uh, I was in the army.
-Oh, come on.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.505
Uh, stationed in Afghanistan.

18:09.588 --> 18:13.550
I play that  Call of Duty: Black Ops II
on the expert level.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.719
[stammers] That's the highest.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.848
It's very nice to meet you, Colt.
I'll let you get to your workout.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.850
Hey, Paul. [clears throat]

18:22.601 --> 18:25.061
You're new around here.
You wanna grab a drink sometime?

18:25.146 --> 18:26.355
Yeah, yeah, sure, maybe.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.691
What's your poison? Ales? Lagers?

18:30.276 --> 18:33.279
You ever wake up
in the monkey pit at the zoo,

18:33.362 --> 18:35.822
covered in vomit and you're not sure
whether it's yours or the monkey's?

18:38.409 --> 18:39.701
You know what, Colt? I'm...

18:39.785 --> 18:42.913
I'm just gonna run down to the office,
make sure it's okay for you to be here.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.542
I'll, uh... I'll be honest with you.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.547
-I came here to check you out.
-What?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.134
I'm the father of Heather's baby.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.428
[stammering] It's my first kid, so...

18:57.511 --> 19:01.182
I... I just... wanted to make sure you
weren't some kind of crazy psychopath.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.225
You know the kind of guy
I'm talking about.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.643
Yeah, I think I do.

19:06.019 --> 19:09.606
But, actually,
you seem like a pretty good guy, so...

19:10.691 --> 19:11.733
I'm happy you and Heather met.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.320
Hey, I'll tell you what,
next time I come down here,

19:14.403 --> 19:16.988
how about you and me,
we do a little bit of wrestling, huh?

19:17.072 --> 19:19.366
[exclaims] Ow.
Okay. I wasn't ready.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.623
Okay, Charlene, get the TV remote.

19:26.707 --> 19:30.043
Yes, it... it says right on it,
"TV remote."

19:30.877 --> 19:33.505
Now, push the input button.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.674
No, no, no! Damn it, Charlene.

19:35.757 --> 19:39.303
You're gonna have to wait to watch
Tiny House Hunters  when I get home.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.138
Good Lord, have mercy!

19:43.014 --> 19:44.433
I love that woman to death,

19:44.516 --> 19:46.935
but the only buttons she knows
how to push are mine.

19:47.018 --> 19:48.395
[chuckles]

19:48.479 --> 19:51.523
Hey, if you want, I can swing by your
house and help Charlene with the remote.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.818
Hey, uh, does your daughter still live
at home?

19:56.152 --> 19:59.698
Rooster, have you ever been shot
with a horse tranquilizer?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.827
Would it be weird if the answer is yes?

20:05.621 --> 20:09.333
So, look, I, uh, fixed the latch
on the front gate, salted the drive.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.792
What else you want me to do?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.587
Well, I've got to go check
on my golden retriever,

20:13.670 --> 20:17.048
who just had a litter
of six gorgeous puppies.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.510
Fucking puppies, man, they are the best.

20:20.469 --> 20:24.097
[laughs] Boy, I'll tell you,
it's gonna blow up my Instagram.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.391
[both laugh]

20:26.141 --> 20:28.852
Hey, while I'm doin' that,
I need you to put your hand up

20:28.935 --> 20:34.275
that cow's, uh, caboose there and pull out
as much manure as you can hold.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.191
[Rooster] Hmm.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.403
That cow hasn't had
a bowel movement in three days.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.614
For me, I take a cup of coffee
first thing in the morning,

20:40.697 --> 20:42.324
and that starts the trains a-rollin'.

20:42.408 --> 20:46.245
[chuckles] Yep, no problem.
I'll take care of it.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.540
Uh, how about the job market? Anything?

20:50.499 --> 20:53.001
Well, actually...

20:53.627 --> 20:55.837
mind if I get your opinion
about somethin'?

20:55.921 --> 20:59.800
Well, if it's about that shirt,
uh, I don't much care for it.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.386
My mom off--

21:03.762 --> 21:05.472
What the hell's wrong with my shirt?

21:05.556 --> 21:10.185
Nothing, if you're going
to a Soundgarden concert in 1996.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.441
Look, uh, Mom offered me
to take over the bar.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.983
Oh, really?

21:17.067 --> 21:20.654
Yeah, you know, I... I figured
I'd make a decent living at it, but...

21:21.363 --> 21:23.615
I don't know if that's the right place
for me, you know.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.285
-All I've ever known is ranching.
-[Dale sighs]

21:26.368 --> 21:28.579
I had a similar problem one time.

21:28.662 --> 21:32.874
My dad wanted me to take over
his well-drillin' business.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.461
Oh, yeah?
Well, how'd you end up bein' a vet?

21:35.544 --> 21:38.630
Oh, well, I fell in love with  Lassie
when I was a kid.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.632
I watched every episode of that show.

21:41.758 --> 21:45.178
For me, it was Pam Anderson in  Baywatch,
but I get it.

21:46.847 --> 21:50.309
I told my dad,
"No, I'm a vet. It's in my blood.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.686
I love taking care of animals."

21:52.769 --> 21:55.689
I can't imagine a world
where I did anything else.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.235
-Yeah, that's how I feel about ranching.
-[chuckles]

22:00.319 --> 22:05.407
On the other hand, my brother inherited
the well-drillin' business and, uh...

22:05.491 --> 22:06.950
he hit oil.

22:07.033 --> 22:11.413
Now he's got a big house in Aspen
and a 25-year-old Russian bride.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.583
So what the fuck do I know?

22:19.546 --> 22:22.173
You guys like your salad dressing
mixed in or on the side?

22:22.257 --> 22:24.676
-Don't matter to me.
-Me either.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.344
You guys aren't gonna eat salad, are you?

22:26.428 --> 22:27.929
-Not a chance.
-No way.

22:30.348 --> 22:33.309
Colt, throw these on the grill.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.311
If you burn 'em,
we're gonna have to eat salad.

22:41.693 --> 22:46.823
So, Mr. Bennett, any news on the...
[imitates robot]

22:53.329 --> 22:57.167
Actually, we met today,
decided we're better off as friends.

22:57.250 --> 23:01.087
Oh. And I was already picturing you two
and me and Colt on a double date.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.466
When you pictured that,
was hell frozen over?

23:07.177 --> 23:08.845
Actually, I think it's for the best.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.389
She's comin' over tomorrow.
We're gonna watch a movie.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.642
Well, I'm glad you talked to her.

23:13.725 --> 23:14.935
-[Beau] Yeah.
-This is good news.

23:15.936 --> 23:19.064
-What's good news?
-They renewed  Blue Bloods,  son.

23:19.731 --> 23:22.734
-Aw! Sweet!
-[Beau] Yeah.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.820
[knock on door]

23:27.113 --> 23:28.114
Hey, Heather.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.825
What the fuck is your problem, Colt?

23:29.908 --> 23:32.703
All right, I'm gonna go check
on the fuckin' steaks.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.875
-What's goin' on?
-Why the hell did you go talk to Paul?

23:38.959 --> 23:40.836
What? Why'd you do that?

23:40.919 --> 23:43.421
Well, 'cause you're having my kid.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.507
If this guy's a piece of shit,
that's a problem.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.300
Yeah, but that's not your place
to do that, Colt.

23:47.383 --> 23:50.386
Sure it is. I'm the father.
Back me up here, Ab.

23:50.471 --> 23:51.930
No, this is between you two.

23:52.013 --> 23:53.515
I'm not weighin' in.
It's none of my business.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.476
Just like it's none of your business
who she dates.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.561
But that's not me weighin' in.
Okay, I'm done.

23:58.479 --> 24:01.690
Well, if you'd just introduced me
in the bar instead of actin' all shady,

24:01.773 --> 24:03.567
I wouldn't have had to go check him out.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.652
Are you kidding, Colt?
This was our first date.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.821
What am I supposed to do?
Introduce him to my ex-boyfriend?

24:07.904 --> 24:09.490
I already had to start
with "I'm pregnant."

24:09.573 --> 24:11.617
I'm just being protective of my kid.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.494
Oh, so, what?
Now I just don't know how

24:13.577 --> 24:15.579
to judge someone's character
or make good decisions?

24:15.662 --> 24:18.081
Well, uh, father of the baby.

24:20.291 --> 24:22.418
Maybe I'm the one
who can't judge character.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.963
Whoa! I thought you were
stayin' out of this.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.673
I'm trying. It's very hard.

24:27.758 --> 24:31.052
Hey, Colt, do you believe I care
just as much about this kid as you do?

24:31.136 --> 24:32.178
-Of course.
-Okay,

24:32.262 --> 24:34.097
then you're gonna have to be okay
with me having my own life.

24:34.180 --> 24:37.601
-Just like you have your own life.
-Okay. I get it, okay? I just...

24:38.685 --> 24:39.853
I don't know.

24:40.478 --> 24:43.565
The... the idea of some guy
being around my kid?

24:44.315 --> 24:45.692
That scares the crap out of me.

24:45.776 --> 24:49.404
Okay, and I get that.
But it's gonna happen sooner or later.

24:49.487 --> 24:53.074
I know. I just thought
it'd be after the baby's born.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.951
And, like, turns 18.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.372
Look, if it makes you feel any better,
it's probably not gonna be Paul.

24:59.956 --> 25:03.501
He used half the night to talk about how
I could use algebra at the gas station.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.337
-Man, I forgot how lame teachers are.
-Hey.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.175
-Sorry.
-Look, just do me a favor.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.178
If you end up gettin' serious
with somebody,

25:13.261 --> 25:14.930
just keep me in the loop, all right?

25:15.013 --> 25:18.058
Okay. I will. I'll... I'll try.

25:18.684 --> 25:19.976
Thank you.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.020
Steaks are almost done.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.980
Figure out what the fuck's
wrong with him yet?

25:31.905 --> 25:33.574
-Hey, Ma.
-Hey, sweetheart.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.533
[sighs] Can I get a whiskey?

25:35.617 --> 25:37.327
Yeah, you look like you've had a long day.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.369
Yep.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.748
Whoa, you smell like
you've had a really long day.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.292
Yeah. Sorry.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.628
I was digging through cow shit
at Dale's all day.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.171
Hmm, new hobby?

25:50.173 --> 25:52.050
Just doin' a bunch of odd jobs for him.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.887
Tried to cover the smell with that,
uh, Axe body spray.

25:58.139 --> 26:01.517
Now I just smell like
shit-scented Axe body spray.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.355
And why were you diggin' through
cow manure all day?

26:05.438 --> 26:09.275
Well, he had this constipated cow
and he needed me to take a stool sample.

26:09.359 --> 26:12.738
[inhales deeply] And then all of a sudden,
I noticed some twine in the manure.

26:12.821 --> 26:16.700
You know the old saying, "You see twine
in the shit, there's rope in the cow."

26:17.325 --> 26:19.285
Yeah. I had that on a throw pillow.

26:21.412 --> 26:23.999
So I grab a hose, stuff it in there,
start flushing her out.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.417
Sure enough, there's the end of the twine.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.878
So now I'm pullin' it out of her ass
like a magician's scarf.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.383
Hey, you know,
that reminds me of that Christmas

26:33.466 --> 26:36.762
that you ate the popcorn off the tree,
you know, string and all.

26:37.846 --> 26:41.599
Yeah. Well, should have seen
this poor cow, Mom.

26:42.183 --> 26:44.394
She was in so much pain.
She could have died.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.022
But now she's just shittin' up a storm.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.654
You should see the look
on your face right now.

26:53.737 --> 26:57.198
-[chuckles] Well, it's a pretty fun day.
-You know what?

26:57.991 --> 27:00.952
I'm taking back my offer.
I don't want you to run this bar.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.079
What? No, Mom.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.456
I didn't tell you that story
so I could back out of somethin'.

27:05.540 --> 27:06.541
Just telling you about my day.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.960
Yeah, and I'm just telling you
about your life.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.461
You don't wanna work at this place.

27:10.545 --> 27:13.131
Don't I?
I mean, I need a job. I need money.

27:13.214 --> 27:15.842
Oh, no. You have something
much more important than money.

27:15.926 --> 27:18.511
You have a passion for ranching.

27:18.594 --> 27:20.681
I also have a passion
to pay my phone bill.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.600
Look, that's gonna work itself out.

27:24.685 --> 27:25.977
You know, Dale will keep using you,

27:26.061 --> 27:28.521
you can work around here
whenever you need to.

27:28.604 --> 27:30.190
I mean, we don't have any sick cows,

27:30.273 --> 27:33.443
but Hank did get his arm stuck
in the hand dryer last week.

27:35.278 --> 27:38.073
[sighs] Well, I mean, how are you gonna
leave if I don't take over the bar?

27:38.656 --> 27:41.034
Look, if you were running this place,

27:41.117 --> 27:44.120
and you got an offer for a ranching job,
would you take it?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.665
-No.
-And would you want to take it?

27:48.249 --> 27:50.126
-I... I don't know.
-Rooster.

27:52.128 --> 27:55.506
-[sighs] I mean, yeah, probably.
-That's just it.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.634
I never wanna get in the way of you
and what makes you happy.

28:00.011 --> 28:03.598
And if it makes you happy
to pull twine out of a cow's ass...

28:05.976 --> 28:08.186
then I've done a good job as Mom.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.065
So, what are you gonna do now?

28:12.648 --> 28:15.193
Oh, I don't know.
I'll figure something out.

28:15.276 --> 28:18.071
-You gonna offer the place to Colt?
-Fuck, no.

28:23.534 --> 28:26.079
-So what do you think?
-Oh, it was great.

28:27.163 --> 28:30.751
I loved the part where John Wayne rode
the horse and shot the bad guy.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.711
-Which time?
-Um...

28:34.838 --> 28:37.007
[chuckles] Okay,
I nodded off for a second.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.091
[Beau chuckles]

28:38.174 --> 28:40.176
Just tell me, who shot Liberty Valance?

28:40.260 --> 28:43.221
Are you kiddin' me? The Duke.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.056
And which one is the Duke?

28:46.516 --> 28:47.893
Get out of my house.

28:51.687 --> 28:54.775
Next time we do this,
I get to pick what we watch.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.860
How do you feel about musicals?

28:57.610 --> 29:01.740
If I'm gonna watch somebody dance,
someone better be shootin' at their feet.

29:04.617 --> 29:07.245
-Hey, this was the right call.
-What was?

29:08.204 --> 29:10.081
Just stayin' friends.

29:10.706 --> 29:12.000
Absolutely.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.378
-I had a good time, Beau.
-Me, too.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.756
Drive safe.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.354
-[switch clicks]
-[slow song playing on radio]

29:42.823 --> 29:47.452
I'm not giving your Chevy a jump.
I don't want my Ford to catch anything.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.372
Very funny. I just forgot my keys.

29:52.373 --> 29:54.709
-Here they are.
-Mmm, thank you.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.891
[slow country music playing]
