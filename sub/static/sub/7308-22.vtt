WEBVTT

00:08.400 --> 00:10.236
Good God almighty,
get me out of here.

00:10.402 --> 00:11.987
My head is about to explode.

00:12.738 --> 00:15.199
That was the longest three hours
of my entire freaking life.

00:15.366 --> 00:17.076
You're the one who said no
to the muzzle.

00:17.243 --> 00:19.453
l wanted to shut his pothole
two hours ago.

00:19.662 --> 00:23.415
lt's ''pie-hole.'' And by the way,
we went to the Arby's drive-thru.

00:23.582 --> 00:26.252
No such thing as a ride-thru.
How long have you lived here anyway?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.587
- Man, get off me.
- l'll pay you to take him upstairs.

00:28.754 --> 00:30.881
- Just name your price.
- My rock beat your scissors.

00:31.090 --> 00:34.051
Besides, l've got 5 million in heroin.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.554
- That's nothing.
- Really?

00:36.720 --> 00:39.932
l have a feeling your South African
suppliers won't feel the same way.

00:40.099 --> 00:43.018
Considering how much you owe them,
be thankful you're in our custody.

00:43.185 --> 00:44.270
We're your new best friends.

00:44.437 --> 00:46.897
l don't care what you do to me.
l'm not talking.

00:47.314 --> 00:50.443
l find that really hard to believe.
All yours, Agent David.

00:50.609 --> 00:52.695
- Come on, man. Take off the cuffs.
- Yeah.

00:52.862 --> 00:54.405
Yeah, what's his problem, huh?

00:54.572 --> 00:58.075
You. You're insulting, you're crude and
most of all you are extremely annoying.

00:58.284 --> 01:01.954
<i>l'm annoying? He's the one
rambling on and on about Top Gun,</i>

01:02.121 --> 01:03.622
giving me a freaking migraine.

01:03.789 --> 01:06.083
l didn't realise l had to sit in silence
the entire trip.

01:06.292 --> 01:08.085
Last l checked,
the First Amendment guaranteed--

01:08.252 --> 01:09.253
Enough!

01:15.968 --> 01:17.553
- Get in.
- No.

01:20.431 --> 01:22.725
- He's a newbie.
- Thank you.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.651
He's dead.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.302
l've been travelling to crime scenes
for many years,

02:31.553 --> 02:33.304
but l can say with
complete confidence,

02:33.471 --> 02:36.224
this is the shortest commute
l have ever had.

02:36.391 --> 02:38.351
And one of the first times
l didn't get us lost.

02:38.518 --> 02:39.853
True.

02:40.019 --> 02:41.563
All yours, Duck.

02:43.481 --> 02:45.066
Sure appreciate all the help, Tony.

02:47.110 --> 02:49.738
That's a nice outfit, probie.

02:50.196 --> 02:52.574
Okay, the handbook says
that we are required

02:52.741 --> 02:55.869
to wear this outfit at all active
crime scenes. You know that.

02:56.035 --> 02:57.662
Yeah, but not in our own building.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.707
That's like wearing a nametag
in your own apartment.

03:00.874 --> 03:02.625
Tony?

03:03.084 --> 03:04.335
Come here.

03:06.421 --> 03:07.922
How's she holding up?

03:08.089 --> 03:10.300
Oh, l-- l don't know.
l haven't talked to her yet.

03:10.467 --> 03:11.926
May l ask why?

03:12.093 --> 03:14.220
Because l told him not to, Ducky.

03:14.387 --> 03:16.097
Excuse me.

03:18.099 --> 03:21.686
Right now, she's a suspect,
not an investigator.

03:21.895 --> 03:23.938
Boss, you don't think Ziva's
capable of this, do you?

03:26.524 --> 03:28.735
Well, l mean she's capable of it,

03:28.902 --> 03:31.613
but you don't really think
that she would just--

03:31.780 --> 03:33.281
Kill someone?

03:33.448 --> 03:35.784
Not without a good reason.

03:41.247 --> 03:45.251
Look, we all know that Ziva
has crazy ninja skills,

03:45.418 --> 03:47.712
but, l mean,
she's got some self-control, right?

03:47.879 --> 03:50.256
Not a lot, some?

03:50.882 --> 03:52.467
Never mind.

03:53.051 --> 03:57.305
Forgive me for overstepping,
Jethro, but you and l both know that

03:57.472 --> 04:01.893
this is far beyond
Officer David's character.

04:02.060 --> 04:05.063
lt's not me or you l'm worried
about right now, Duck.

04:05.230 --> 04:06.815
We have a cause of death?

04:06.981 --> 04:09.150
Well, at this point
l'd only be speculating.

04:09.943 --> 04:11.986
We won't know anything specific
until l get him back--

04:12.153 --> 04:15.407
Well, downstairs, l suppose.

04:15.573 --> 04:16.574
No bruising?

04:16.783 --> 04:19.994
Yeah, well, the only injury
l've been able to find

04:20.161 --> 04:23.498
is this on the top of his head here.

04:27.168 --> 04:28.920
Sorry.

04:29.087 --> 04:30.672
l'll zig.

04:30.839 --> 04:32.674
You zag.

04:35.176 --> 04:37.303
Here, allow me.

04:40.181 --> 04:41.433
lt looks recent.

04:41.599 --> 04:44.811
Yeah, well, based on its location,

04:44.978 --> 04:50.024
it appears that he struck his head
on one of these rails when he fell.

04:50.233 --> 04:52.318
Oh, come on, Jethro, l mean,

04:52.485 --> 04:56.030
there's no sign
of any physical altercation.

04:56.197 --> 04:59.534
Duck, with her training,
there wouldn't be.

05:03.538 --> 05:04.706
Hey.

05:09.878 --> 05:13.089
- Ready to hear my side of the story?
- Well, we're not gonna hear his.

05:13.256 --> 05:14.716
l didn't touch him.

05:14.883 --> 05:16.342
Hardly at all.

05:16.509 --> 05:18.887
When the elevator doors opened,
he refused to get in.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.222
lf this was a year ago,
l would have snapped his neck,

05:21.431 --> 05:22.515
but it's not and l didn't.

05:24.392 --> 05:28.646
l asked him several times to step
into the elevator.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.357
He wouldn't cooperate.

05:34.194 --> 05:36.488
- And that's when l struck him.
- How?

05:36.654 --> 05:37.739
- With my fist.
- Where?

05:37.906 --> 05:39.491
ln the jugular.

05:40.909 --> 05:44.079
Can you believe l'm about to go
to my first crime scene?

05:45.914 --> 05:47.707
lt's not a good time.

05:48.249 --> 05:49.667
lt was just a little love tap.

05:49.834 --> 05:51.753
Choked him up for
a couple of seconds, that's all.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.588
Look, l know this looks bad.

05:54.214 --> 05:55.673
l also know with
Brian Dempsey dead,

05:55.840 --> 05:59.594
it's nearly impossible to bring down
his South African distributors,

06:00.428 --> 06:02.263
much less prosecute his brother.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.766
That's not our biggest problem here,
Ziva.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.602
lt appears there's only one way
to fix this.

06:08.770 --> 06:10.772
l've seen it in
your American movies.

06:14.943 --> 06:16.444
This is where l resign.

06:17.904 --> 06:20.740
Next time you hand me your badge,

06:21.282 --> 06:24.327
you had better be prepared to lose it.

06:35.630 --> 06:39.134
After all these years, l'm finally
losing my crime scene virginity.

06:39.342 --> 06:42.345
Wow, l don't think
that's ever been said before.

06:44.139 --> 06:46.683
l think we've got enough
crime scene pictures.

06:46.891 --> 06:48.393
Sorry, McGee. l just--

06:48.810 --> 06:52.230
Maybe your hat is turning me
into some sort of super agent.

06:52.397 --> 06:55.108
That's weird, because it never had
that affect on McGee.

06:59.863 --> 07:01.781
Why do l feel like everyone's
staring at me?

07:02.824 --> 07:04.659
Because they are.

07:05.201 --> 07:06.911
Did l do something wrong?

07:08.163 --> 07:10.081
Have you ever been to Disneyland,
Abby?

07:10.665 --> 07:12.500
- Every summer.
- Yeah.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.336
You know those camera-toting tourists
with the tall white socks

07:15.503 --> 07:17.297
up to their knees,
wearing fanny packs?

07:17.464 --> 07:20.759
Well, yeah. We spend half the time
laughing at them...

07:33.772 --> 07:35.523
Oh, my God.

07:35.690 --> 07:37.525
l've turned into my Uncle Larry.

07:37.692 --> 07:39.694
This man doesn't look a day
over 30, doctor.

07:39.861 --> 07:42.530
According to his arrest report,

07:42.697 --> 07:46.284
he would have been 25 next month.

07:46.493 --> 07:50.413
So assuming Ziva didn't kill him,
that means he just dropped dead?

07:51.122 --> 07:54.375
lt would appear that way,
wouldn't it?

07:54.542 --> 07:55.710
He's so young.

07:55.877 --> 07:57.712
Yes, my father used to say:

07:57.879 --> 08:02.133
''We must live for today,
because yesterday is gone,

08:02.300 --> 08:04.636
and tomorrow may never come.''

08:04.803 --> 08:06.596
You know,
that's really beautiful, doctor.

08:06.763 --> 08:10.183
Yes, unfortunately,
he never practised what he preached.

08:10.350 --> 08:13.561
He was always a bit
of a penny-pincher.

08:14.479 --> 08:16.731
A Papa Scrooge, if you like.

08:17.273 --> 08:22.153
That was one reason that he and
my mother went their separate ways.

08:22.904 --> 08:24.406
Yeah, most people don't know this,

08:24.572 --> 08:27.659
but financial disputes are
the second leading cause of divorce.

08:27.826 --> 08:30.745
- Really? What's number one?
- Marriage.

08:30.912 --> 08:32.496
Actually, l'm pretty sure it's infidelity.

08:32.664 --> 08:35.041
See, the study l read said that--
Never mind.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.919
l understand your sense of urgency,
Jethro,

08:38.086 --> 08:40.087
but my examination
is still under way.

08:40.255 --> 08:41.589
Just tell me what you know, Duck.

08:41.756 --> 08:45.343
Well, so far l found
no life-threatening abnormalities.

08:45.552 --> 08:47.262
What about his throat?

08:48.263 --> 08:51.015
We did, in our internal examination,

08:51.182 --> 08:54.602
find a slight irritation
of the anterior jugular,

08:54.769 --> 08:59.524
perhaps caused by a physical blow.

09:00.650 --> 09:02.277
Was the blow fatal?

09:02.902 --> 09:04.821
lt didn't appear to be.

09:04.988 --> 09:07.866
Look, l won't know the cause
of this man's death

09:08.032 --> 09:09.617
until l've completed my work.

09:10.452 --> 09:14.914
MRls, Abby's tox screen,
and they're all forthcoming.

09:15.081 --> 09:16.916
l know what you want to hear,
Jethro,

09:17.083 --> 09:20.295
but Officer David is not
off the hook yet.

09:43.818 --> 09:47.155
Hey. Will you stop doing that?
You're making me nervous.

09:47.322 --> 09:49.282
How long can it possibly take?

09:49.908 --> 09:53.328
Well, l don't know, Ziva.
lt's an autopsy, not an oil change.

09:53.536 --> 09:57.207
You know, l don't think we're supposed
to be talking about the case with her.

09:57.415 --> 09:59.292
lt's a simple conversation, you know?

09:59.459 --> 10:00.627
''What do you have, Ducky?''

10:01.127 --> 10:05.673
''Well, Jethro, this reminds me of
a time back at Scotland Yard when l--''

10:05.840 --> 10:07.342
''To the point, Ducky.''

10:07.509 --> 10:13.348
''Well, based on my preliminary
findings, Ziva did not kill this man.''

10:15.809 --> 10:17.435
What?

10:19.187 --> 10:20.772
What?

10:31.991 --> 10:33.159
So?

10:34.077 --> 10:36.371
Did you talk to Ducky?

10:36.663 --> 10:38.665
- Yeah.
- And?

10:38.832 --> 10:41.376
And now l have to
go talk to the director.

10:44.462 --> 10:46.631
Maybe she really did kill that guy.

10:47.382 --> 10:49.134
Hey, Gibbs, what did Ducky say?

10:49.926 --> 10:51.010
Gibbs.

10:51.219 --> 10:53.972
Hey, are you going to tell me anything,
or not?

10:54.806 --> 10:58.393
There's nothing to tell yet, Ziva.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.483
Stan, it's Cynthia again.

11:05.650 --> 11:07.318
l'm really starting to get worried.

11:07.485 --> 11:10.029
Please call me as soon
as you get this.

11:10.238 --> 11:12.073
- ls she in?
- Still not back from lunch.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.242
And he's been waiting
for a half an hour.

11:17.328 --> 11:18.496
He'll survive.

11:18.663 --> 11:21.708
lt's not like her, Agent Gibbs.
She's never been late for a meeting.

11:21.875 --> 11:22.959
You try her driver?

11:23.126 --> 11:25.253
Stan's not answering his cell or pager.

11:25.420 --> 11:26.838
l've left him four messages.

11:27.005 --> 11:30.425
l really don't know what else to do.
l've been calling her cell--

11:33.803 --> 11:36.806
<i>- Agent Gibbs.
- Director.</i>

11:36.973 --> 11:38.808
We've got a major problem here.

11:38.975 --> 11:42.812
Sorry to hear that, Jethro.
l have quite a serious problem myself.

11:43.021 --> 11:44.814
l'm sure you're gonna
wanna hear mine first.

11:44.981 --> 11:48.401
l'm not entirely sure that's true.

11:50.820 --> 11:54.449
You really should be listening
to her problem, Jethro.

11:55.533 --> 11:57.619
<i>You're holding my heroin
and my little brother.</i>

11:58.286 --> 12:02.207
lf l don't get both back in two hours,
she dies.

12:03.458 --> 12:04.876
l'll call back with the details.

12:21.326 --> 12:24.997
She called in at 1 1 :45 when she
arrived at the Whitmore Hotel.

12:25.163 --> 12:29.001
According to the senator's assistant,
lunch was over at 1 2:50,

12:29.167 --> 12:31.169
ten minutes ahead of schedule.

12:31.336 --> 12:34.381
- She never checked in again.
- l need to see her itinerary.

12:34.548 --> 12:36.591
l can't do that, Agent Gibbs.

12:49.396 --> 12:52.941
l'm not trying to be difficult,
but the director's been very clear.

12:53.108 --> 12:54.860
Her schedule is confidential.
Even to you.

12:55.027 --> 12:56.194
Are you done?

12:56.778 --> 12:58.488
Director Shepard
has been kidnapped.

12:58.655 --> 13:01.324
l need to know where she was
when it happened.

13:01.491 --> 13:02.492
Okay.

13:06.371 --> 13:08.915
Here's everything.
Nine a.m., the GAO.

13:09.124 --> 13:11.251
1 0:30 with the ATCC.

13:11.418 --> 13:15.088
And after lunch
a meeting with the B.O.B.

13:15.881 --> 13:18.717
That's Congressman Bob Sommers.

13:19.259 --> 13:21.094
He's a friend.

13:21.261 --> 13:23.388
lt doesn't say
where she's meeting him.

13:23.555 --> 13:27.601
l'm not sure. She has the car wait
at the hotel, gets coffee nearby.

13:27.851 --> 13:30.395
- You think Bob's involved?
- No. lt'll give me a search radius.

13:30.604 --> 13:31.980
Give me a copy of this, will you?

13:34.274 --> 13:37.402
- What else can l do?
- Keep quiet.

13:37.736 --> 13:40.072
She's gonna be okay, right?

13:50.123 --> 13:52.959
lf you have a question, ask it.

13:53.126 --> 13:56.505
l'm afraid you'll put
the Vulcan death grip on me.

13:56.672 --> 13:58.590
l'm considering it.

14:01.385 --> 14:03.929
Where did you learn
to do that anyway?

14:04.596 --> 14:07.057
Years of training on a
secluded desert island?

14:08.767 --> 14:12.604
Blind Master Po always one step
ahead of you.

14:13.814 --> 14:17.651
''When you take the pebble
from my hand,

14:18.276 --> 14:19.361
then it will be time--''

14:20.904 --> 14:22.364
Do that again. Show me--

14:23.532 --> 14:25.283
- DiNozzo.
- Yeah, boss. l was just--

14:25.450 --> 14:27.327
Shut up. Get over here.

14:29.663 --> 14:32.332
James Dempsey
has taken Director Shepard hostage.

14:33.250 --> 14:37.004
He wants his drugs
and his brother back or she dies.

14:37.212 --> 14:38.380
We have two hours.

14:38.588 --> 14:40.799
Last contact was at
the Whitmore Hotel.

14:41.008 --> 14:42.968
- Driver's not responding. DiNozzo.
- On it.

14:43.135 --> 14:44.469
Dempsey used
the director's phone.

14:44.636 --> 14:45.971
l'll start a trace.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.849
What about me?

14:49.975 --> 14:51.435
This is the director's schedule.

14:51.601 --> 14:53.437
Start making calls.

14:53.603 --> 14:55.230
Desk work?

14:56.314 --> 14:58.150
- Put me in the field.
- No, not happening.

14:58.316 --> 15:00.986
- You need me out there.
- Not happening.

15:01.153 --> 15:04.156
l need you at your desk making calls.
Go.

15:05.699 --> 15:07.826
Hey. Clock's ticking, people.

15:07.993 --> 15:10.537
Jenny can take care of herself,
Gibbs.

15:10.996 --> 15:13.206
- She was a good agent.
- Still is.

15:15.083 --> 15:18.170
<i>l've been investigating James
Dempsey for nine months, Gibbs.</i>

15:18.337 --> 15:20.547
<i>Seems like a frat boy on the surface,
but the guy's brutal.</i>

15:20.714 --> 15:22.758
<i>We've linked him to half a dozen
unsolved homicides.</i>

15:23.842 --> 15:27.346
<i>Still, kidnapping the director of NClS
takes guts l didn't know he had.</i>

15:27.554 --> 15:30.098
He's gonna kill her, Cassie.
Nothing to be impressed by.

15:30.515 --> 15:31.850
<i>l'm not impressed. l'm worried.</i>

15:32.017 --> 15:33.977
Any intel from those squids
you busted?

15:34.144 --> 15:36.271
<i>They're just mules moving product
for the South Africans.</i>

15:36.480 --> 15:38.065
<i>Didn't even know
who they were working for.</i>

15:38.231 --> 15:40.275
<i>- Get down here.
- Be there in a couple of hours.</i>

15:40.442 --> 15:44.029
Hold on. Base commander
has got a chopper waiting.

15:44.196 --> 15:47.407
<i>The only thing James Dempsey loves
more than money is his baby brother.</i>

15:47.574 --> 15:49.034
<i>As long as you've got
Brian in custody,</i>

15:49.201 --> 15:50.786
<i>James should be
easy to manipulate.</i>

15:50.952 --> 15:52.204
Brian Dempsey's dead.

15:53.372 --> 15:57.042
You still think he'll be
easy to manipulate, Cassie?

15:58.460 --> 16:00.212
<i>l'm on my way.</i>

16:04.257 --> 16:06.968
- This is totally disturbing.
- Yes, it is.

16:07.135 --> 16:08.887
l mean, who would
treat their feet like that?

16:10.639 --> 16:12.557
- Feet?
- Yeah, look at these soles.

16:12.724 --> 16:14.393
You know what that does
to somebody's arches?

16:14.559 --> 16:17.854
Heel spurs, torn ligaments, not to
mention the effect on spinal alignment.

16:18.021 --> 16:19.481
Abby, he was a drug dealer.

16:19.648 --> 16:21.566
McGee, there is no excuse
for poor foot care.

16:22.150 --> 16:24.444
You wear platforms,
and l'm trying to work here.

16:25.404 --> 16:27.572
Are you still tracking
the director's cell phone?

16:27.739 --> 16:30.492
Well, l tracked it to half a dozen
different cell towers.

16:30.659 --> 16:31.743
He called from a car.

16:31.910 --> 16:34.913
- Driving down the 395.
- Were there any other calls?

16:35.080 --> 16:37.249
Phone was turned off.
Probably tossed it.

16:37.416 --> 16:39.584
l pinpointed the GPS
to its last location.

16:39.751 --> 16:41.336
Great.

16:41.878 --> 16:43.296
Not great?

16:43.463 --> 16:46.591
lt's a major interchange. He could
have taken any of the four highways.

16:46.758 --> 16:49.136
- So much for plan A.
- Better have a plan B.

16:49.302 --> 16:51.680
Gibbs. Are you okay?

16:51.847 --> 16:53.932
l was worried about you
because of the director and all.

16:54.099 --> 16:55.600
l know you guys are really close.

16:55.767 --> 16:58.145
Plan B. l'm running samples
on Brian Dempsey's clothing

16:58.311 --> 17:00.856
and personal effects to Sherlock,
where he's been hanging out.

17:01.064 --> 17:03.275
- And?
- lt's going to take some time.

17:03.483 --> 17:05.444
Which we don't have,
so l'll hurry up now.

17:05.609 --> 17:07.029
l'm working a different angle.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.990
Collecting Brian Dempsey's
credit cards and phone records.

17:10.156 --> 17:13.285
By creating a simple algorithm
using his personal data,

17:13.452 --> 17:16.079
l constructed a computer model
of his buying patterns

17:16.246 --> 17:17.705
juxtaposed with his calling patterns.

17:17.873 --> 17:20.625
l don't care. Get it done.

17:34.473 --> 17:35.974
- Get out.
- Easy there, Rudd.

17:36.433 --> 17:37.809
She's not one of your dates.

17:37.976 --> 17:40.896
She wouldn't even be here
if your idiot brother didn't get caught.

17:41.313 --> 17:44.066
l apologise for Alex.
He takes some getting used to.

17:44.983 --> 17:48.904
Once you get to know him,
you'll really learn to hate him.

17:53.867 --> 17:55.702
On your knees.

17:58.872 --> 18:00.540
Please.

18:04.503 --> 18:05.879
You're wasting your time.

18:06.046 --> 18:08.924
l'm just trying to make you
more comfortable.

18:10.133 --> 18:11.718
l meant taking me hostage.

18:14.513 --> 18:16.306
They're never going to negotiate.

18:16.473 --> 18:19.226
Well, don't sell yourself so short.

18:20.060 --> 18:22.104
- They're not allowed to.
- l don't know.

18:22.688 --> 18:24.731
Agent Gibbs seems fond of you.

18:25.982 --> 18:27.234
Maybe he'll make an exception.

18:29.903 --> 18:31.988
Gibbs thinks of me like a wife.

18:32.739 --> 18:33.740
See?

18:34.700 --> 18:36.535
He's had three.

18:36.702 --> 18:39.830
We busted your brother
with 5 million in pure heroin.

18:39.997 --> 18:42.791
You think the Navy's
just going to give him back?

18:44.543 --> 18:45.961
Stand up.

18:47.796 --> 18:49.506
Now.

18:53.802 --> 18:55.220
On the chair.

19:06.064 --> 19:07.858
Lean back.

19:12.738 --> 19:14.906
l'm sorry about this.

19:15.574 --> 19:18.702
My brother's always had a way
of getting us in trouble.

19:18.869 --> 19:22.039
l'm the one who bails us out.

19:22.914 --> 19:25.208
You didn't break someone's window
with a baseball.

19:25.417 --> 19:28.253
You kidnapped the head
of a federal agency.

19:28.420 --> 19:31.089
Yeah. You got a point.

19:33.050 --> 19:34.843
But look on the bright side.

19:35.552 --> 19:37.095
This will be over soon.

19:39.097 --> 19:41.099
- One way or the other.
- Stanley.

19:41.850 --> 19:43.435
Excuse me?

19:44.102 --> 19:46.271
- My driver.
- He's fine.

19:48.065 --> 19:49.983
Might be a little uncomfortable.

19:50.150 --> 19:52.486
We stuck him in
the trunk of your car.

19:54.196 --> 19:56.156
See? l'm not a bad guy.

19:56.698 --> 20:00.619
l just want the drugs you stole from me
and my brother back.

20:05.916 --> 20:09.461
Yes, l know
it's confidential information

20:09.628 --> 20:11.755
but please don't put me on hold.

20:13.006 --> 20:15.467
- You all right?
- l'm doing desk work.

20:17.010 --> 20:18.095
Could be worse.

20:18.261 --> 20:21.223
What part of ''desk work''
don't you understand?

20:21.390 --> 20:23.392
<i>- Agent David, are you there?
- Yes, hello.</i>

20:23.600 --> 20:27.729
Hello, yes. Yes, all l want is--
No, no. Don't.

20:31.858 --> 20:33.610
l know what you're going through.

20:33.777 --> 20:35.112
Really?

20:35.278 --> 20:39.783
Are you making pointless phone calls
and following up dead leads?

20:39.950 --> 20:41.034
That's not what l mean.

20:44.621 --> 20:45.998
When l shot that cop,

20:48.291 --> 20:50.919
l felt like everyone doubted me.

20:52.671 --> 20:54.089
But after a while...

20:57.843 --> 20:59.678
Are you trying to
make me feel better?

20:59.845 --> 21:02.014
ls it not working?

21:03.223 --> 21:04.891
lt's not necessary, McGee.

21:09.021 --> 21:11.690
Our only concern
should be the director.

21:12.399 --> 21:13.650
You're right.

21:15.610 --> 21:17.696
Put me on hold again
and l'll jump through this phone

21:17.863 --> 21:20.615
<i>- and l will strangle you.
- Hold, please.</i>

21:20.782 --> 21:22.701
Hey, McGee.

21:24.369 --> 21:26.538
Nobody ever doubted you.

21:26.955 --> 21:30.000
Just like those calls you're making
aren't pointless.

21:32.294 --> 21:34.212
We're looking for a black Town Car.

21:34.379 --> 21:36.256
You're going to have to be
more specific.

21:36.423 --> 21:38.050
lt's got federal plates.

21:38.216 --> 21:40.052
You just described
half our clientele.

21:40.927 --> 21:43.555
Look, the car belongs
to the director of NClS.

21:44.306 --> 21:46.475
She comes with a driver.
She's here twice a week.

21:46.641 --> 21:48.477
- Director Shepard.
- Yeah.

21:48.643 --> 21:50.062
Why didn't you say so?

21:50.228 --> 21:53.065
- l was trying to be discreet.
- ls she all right?

21:53.231 --> 21:54.941
She's just peachy.

21:55.108 --> 21:57.486
She just left her keys in her car.

21:57.652 --> 21:59.029
Here we are.

21:59.196 --> 22:00.906
Looks like the door is open.

22:01.073 --> 22:02.407
Hold on.

22:10.957 --> 22:13.335
ls this a crime scene,
Agent DiNozzo?

22:15.087 --> 22:16.254
lt is now.

22:27.192 --> 22:29.027
The director's driver was taken
by surprise,

22:29.194 --> 22:30.653
then shot in the back of the head.

22:30.820 --> 22:32.197
Dempsey then kidnapped the director

22:32.363 --> 22:34.324
and is demanding the return
of his drugs,

22:34.491 --> 22:36.951
his brother or she dies.

22:37.118 --> 22:39.579
Let's hope we find him
before that happens, Officer David.

22:39.746 --> 22:42.207
Here's everything l've got
on the Dempseys.

22:42.373 --> 22:44.751
Nine months of surveillance,
wiretaps, buy-busts.

22:44.918 --> 22:46.836
Where do l sit?

22:47.212 --> 22:48.922
Any of this gonna help
me find the director?

22:49.088 --> 22:52.175
Probably not. Wish l could tell you
l had someone inside his organization.

22:52.342 --> 22:53.760
You never flipped an informant?

22:53.927 --> 22:56.846
l was hoping to flip his brother,
obviously that's never gonna happen.

23:00.099 --> 23:01.976
Officer David.

23:02.435 --> 23:03.978
Got it, Tony.

23:04.854 --> 23:07.774
Tony's uploading the Whitmore Hotel
security footage right now.

23:07.941 --> 23:09.442
He's got Dempsey
leaving the garage.

23:09.609 --> 23:11.444
He's had less than a day
to target the director.

23:11.611 --> 23:13.571
He'll have been sloppy.
Left a trail.

23:13.738 --> 23:15.824
James Dempsey's
in the passenger seat.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.617
The director must be in the back.

23:18.910 --> 23:20.954
- Who's driving?
- Alex Rudd.

23:21.621 --> 23:24.082
Point man for the cartels running
drugs through South Africa.

23:24.249 --> 23:25.667
Guy's a serious psychopath, Gibbs.

23:26.126 --> 23:28.920
l didn't know he was in the country.

23:29.337 --> 23:31.548
But l know 50 places
he likes to hang out.

23:31.756 --> 23:33.883
- l'll start knocking down doors.
- No, l need you here.

23:34.092 --> 23:35.802
- Get somebody else to do it.
- l'll start--

23:35.969 --> 23:38.429
No, you're not going anywhere.
You sit down.

23:38.596 --> 23:41.057
Run a BOLO on that car.

23:42.517 --> 23:44.561
We'll get her back, Gibbs.

23:51.568 --> 23:53.570
You think she's already dead.

23:53.736 --> 23:58.324
l think today's a real bad day to be
the director of NClS, Officer David.

24:02.162 --> 24:04.038
That's a nice plane out there.

24:04.664 --> 24:06.332
G-Three, right?

24:06.791 --> 24:07.959
l wouldn't know.

24:11.671 --> 24:15.258
Range, 41 00 nautical miles,

24:16.259 --> 24:18.344
unless you risk refuelling.

24:18.511 --> 24:20.889
But you don't look like
the European type to me.

24:24.934 --> 24:28.771
l'm thinking more Mexico
or the Caribbean.

24:29.606 --> 24:31.274
Yeah, Mexico would be great.

24:31.441 --> 24:34.277
My baby brother's always wanted
to see Cabo.

24:34.444 --> 24:36.779
Maybe you can take him there...

24:37.780 --> 24:40.408
...in 30 to 40 years.

24:40.992 --> 24:42.702
Where's your pilot, Dempsey?

24:42.869 --> 24:45.038
l told you. He's on his way.

24:45.205 --> 24:47.832
What the hell? You've got her
in full view of the window, mate.

24:49.834 --> 24:51.961
- l tried to tell him.
- No one's gonna see her.

24:52.128 --> 24:53.963
That's a dangerous assumption.

24:54.380 --> 24:57.383
Who knows how many people saw you
stuff me in your car?

24:57.550 --> 24:59.928
You've kidnapped the head
of a federal agency.

25:00.136 --> 25:02.472
They take that very seriously.

25:02.639 --> 25:04.891
Look, l know you're tight
with your brother, mate,

25:05.058 --> 25:06.434
but you are not thinking.

25:06.601 --> 25:09.896
- She's just messing with you.
- Well, she's doing a good job of it.

25:10.355 --> 25:12.649
How exactly do you see this thing
working out?

25:12.857 --> 25:15.318
We should have just shot her
like her damn driver.

25:15.485 --> 25:17.403
l gave NClS two hours.

25:17.570 --> 25:19.739
They've only got 58 minutes left.
Just relax.

25:19.906 --> 25:22.784
We're gone as soon as
your fly-boy shows up.

25:22.951 --> 25:24.494
We're not leaving
without my brother.

25:24.661 --> 25:26.579
lt's your brother who screwed up.

25:26.746 --> 25:29.082
Now l've got to explain to my bosses
how you lost our product

25:29.249 --> 25:30.875
and you don't have the money
to pay for it.

25:31.042 --> 25:32.836
- l'm getting it back.
- Yeah?

25:35.588 --> 25:36.756
Good luck with that

25:36.923 --> 25:39.300
because l'm not sticking around
to find out.

25:46.182 --> 25:49.853
Looks like you have a difficult decision,
James.

25:50.061 --> 25:51.646
lt's either him or your brother.

25:57.902 --> 26:01.906
l trust you remembered my tea
this time, Mr. Palmer.

26:02.407 --> 26:06.077
lt's only me, Ducky.
And l'm empty-handed.

26:06.953 --> 26:10.623
Well, the coffee stand
is unable to master the art

26:10.832 --> 26:13.042
of brewing a decent cup
of Earl Grey.

26:13.209 --> 26:14.461
Those are from Brian Dempsey?

26:14.669 --> 26:17.505
Yeah. l cannot discuss it with you,
my dear. l don't mean to be rude.

26:17.672 --> 26:18.756
No, l understand, Ducky.

26:18.965 --> 26:20.925
And you probably shouldn't be
down here.

26:21.134 --> 26:24.095
l shouldn't be here.
l shouldn't be in the field.

26:24.262 --> 26:26.806
Can you please,
please tell me where l should be?

26:27.015 --> 26:29.809
Well, l can understand
your feelings of alienation.

26:29.976 --> 26:33.146
Everyone's avoiding me.
Do they think l'm going to lose control,

26:33.313 --> 26:35.106
just enter the building
and massacre everyone?

26:35.273 --> 26:37.317
l mean,
l'm being treated like a leopard.

26:37.484 --> 26:39.777
l believe the phrase is ''like a leper.''

26:42.864 --> 26:45.950
Look, Ziva, you mustn't start
blaming yourself.

26:46.117 --> 26:47.619
l don't.

26:47.785 --> 26:51.289
l know where l hit Brian Dempsey.

26:51.456 --> 26:53.041
l know how severely l hit him.

26:53.666 --> 26:56.961
And, Ducky, l know.
l know l didn't kill him.

26:57.128 --> 26:58.296
Then why are you here?

26:58.463 --> 27:01.841
Because l need for you
to tell Gibbs that.

27:02.509 --> 27:04.719
Tell me what, Ziva?

27:05.887 --> 27:08.765
That the BOLO came back on the car
the director was kidnapped in.

27:08.932 --> 27:11.309
lt was abandoned three miles
from the hotel.

27:11.476 --> 27:13.478
lt's en route to NClS.

27:13.645 --> 27:15.563
lt should be here--

27:16.481 --> 27:17.565
Back to your desk.

27:19.984 --> 27:23.905
l am of no use chained to a computer,
Gibbs.

27:24.113 --> 27:25.740
l should be out looking for her. l--

27:25.907 --> 27:29.452
lt wasn't a suggestion,
Officer David.

27:36.459 --> 27:38.670
- l--
- l don't care.

27:44.384 --> 27:46.094
Don't you think you're being hard
on her?

27:46.261 --> 27:47.595
Not the time to hold hands, Ducky.

27:47.762 --> 27:49.222
Even though you feel
she's blameless?

27:49.389 --> 27:50.640
You have anything to back that up?

27:50.849 --> 27:53.601
l found blood on Mr. Dempsey's
brain tissue.

27:53.768 --> 27:57.272
He may have died
of an intracranial haemorrhage.

27:57.438 --> 27:58.523
May have?

27:58.690 --> 28:01.401
Yes, well, l sent the tissue up
for a full neural report.

28:01.568 --> 28:03.695
lf that turns out to be the case,

28:03.862 --> 28:08.032
the haemorrhaging could be the result
of a pre-existing condition.

28:08.199 --> 28:11.035
Or a well-placed strike to the jugular.

28:11.661 --> 28:16.249
Yeah. At this point, Jethro,
the truth is anybody's guess.

28:23.006 --> 28:24.507
l thought you didn't believe
in voodoo.

28:25.049 --> 28:27.760
This isn't voodoo, McGee.
lt's tarot.

28:27.927 --> 28:29.262
The ancient art of divination.

28:29.429 --> 28:31.890
So you're using tarot cards to find
the director?

28:32.056 --> 28:34.767
Of course not.
lt just helps me think.

28:35.518 --> 28:38.897
We have less than an hour,
so l mean, you could be working.

28:39.063 --> 28:41.733
l am identifying the mystery goo
from Brian Dempsey's sneaker.

28:42.358 --> 28:45.403
And don't forget the old saying:
''A watched G.C. mass spec--''

28:45.570 --> 28:47.280
Never boils.

28:47.447 --> 28:49.449
Well, l was going to say
never compares well

28:49.616 --> 28:52.076
to the concentration of atomic mass,
but where's my CAF-POW?

28:52.285 --> 28:53.536
We're in a time crunch here.

28:53.745 --> 28:56.498
- You have to do this one caffeine free.
- Bite your tongue.

28:57.040 --> 29:00.794
Rule number nine,
always keep a spare.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.797
l thought Gibbs said nine was
always carry a knife.

29:03.963 --> 29:06.424
Not Gibbs' rules. Mine.

29:07.383 --> 29:09.385
l got the physical evidence
from the director's car.

29:09.594 --> 29:11.971
Cigarette butts, empty coffee cup

29:12.138 --> 29:14.933
and a half-sucked breath mint.

29:16.935 --> 29:19.145
Nothing that gets us closer
to James Dempsey's location.

29:19.312 --> 29:23.233
Ah, tarot. The ancient art
of divination.

29:25.735 --> 29:27.487
Guys, l've got something.

29:28.112 --> 29:29.823
l've got something here.

29:30.782 --> 29:33.159
l've plotted on the map
the locations where Brian Dempsey

29:33.326 --> 29:35.370
made credit-card purchases
in the last six months.

29:35.537 --> 29:38.540
That's gas, ATM withdrawals,
motel rooms, everything.

29:38.706 --> 29:41.709
Then l cross-referenced the cell
towers that his phone interfaced with.

29:41.876 --> 29:43.461
l can literally map out his life.

29:43.628 --> 29:46.756
Strip clubs, escort services,
off-track betting.

29:46.923 --> 29:48.591
The guy had so much to live for.

29:48.758 --> 29:49.843
According to my programme,

29:50.009 --> 29:53.930
Brian Dempsey spent the majority
of his time in this 50-square-mile area.

29:54.139 --> 29:56.808
And this helps us
find the director how?

29:57.684 --> 29:59.602
lt helps us narrow down
the search radius.

29:59.769 --> 30:03.356
Do you have any idea how long it takes
to search 50 square miles, McGee?

30:03.523 --> 30:05.191
Too long.

30:09.571 --> 30:11.865
His name was Stanley.

30:12.991 --> 30:16.744
The man you murdered
in the parking garage, James.

30:22.917 --> 30:24.752
l didn't kill your driver.

30:27.589 --> 30:29.466
l tried to stop it.

30:32.385 --> 30:33.887
Good.

30:34.304 --> 30:37.140
Then you still have a chance
of getting out of it.

30:37.307 --> 30:40.351
lt's more than l can say
for your boss out there.

30:40.518 --> 30:42.395
He's not my boss.

30:43.271 --> 30:45.106
He's a business partner.

30:46.608 --> 30:50.445
Well, l'd keep an eye on
your business partner if l were you.

30:51.070 --> 30:53.114
Yeah? Why's that?

30:55.200 --> 30:58.745
Because it sounds like
he's about to take off without you.

31:08.046 --> 31:10.590
- What are you doing?.
- The pilot's here. We're leaving.

31:10.799 --> 31:12.467
l'm about to make the call.

31:12.634 --> 31:16.054
You really think the feds are going
to negotiate with you, mate?

31:16.221 --> 31:17.222
Yeah, l do.

31:17.430 --> 31:19.265
Than you're even dumber
than your kid brother.

31:19.432 --> 31:20.600
They'll bring him and our drugs

31:20.809 --> 31:23.353
if they wanna see
their director alive again.

31:23.561 --> 31:25.855
That's what's
holding you back, huh?

31:26.314 --> 31:28.399
Easy to fix.

31:40.328 --> 31:42.163
l just shot him
to get my brother back.

31:42.914 --> 31:45.291
What do you think
l'll do to you?

31:51.131 --> 31:52.549
Tick-tock, McGee.

31:52.715 --> 31:54.801
James Dempsey should be calling
any second.

31:55.510 --> 31:57.554
Tactical's pre-positioned
in the search grid.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.139
Okay, trace programme's
almost ready.

31:59.305 --> 32:01.141
Just need another computer
for backup.

32:01.307 --> 32:04.435
Oh, Ziva. You're not using this,
are you?

32:04.602 --> 32:06.271
Thanks.

32:08.606 --> 32:10.608
l'm being wasted here.

32:10.775 --> 32:13.444
You'll need me when James Dempsey
finds out his brother's dead.

32:13.611 --> 32:14.779
We don't need the brother.

32:14.946 --> 32:16.781
Once we have a location,
we take him out.

32:16.948 --> 32:18.449
All the more reason why
l should be--

32:20.243 --> 32:22.954
Okay, we're connected.
Trace starts when you pick up, boss.

32:30.253 --> 32:32.630
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Listen carefully.</i>

32:32.797 --> 32:35.633
- One car, one agent in the back.
- Put Director Shepard on.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.928
You're wasting time, Agent Gibbs.
Time you don't have.

32:39.095 --> 32:41.264
Put her on or the deal's off.

32:44.976 --> 32:47.353
He wants to know if you're still alive.

32:48.354 --> 32:50.732
Play nice and you'll stay that way.

32:51.691 --> 32:54.777
- l'm fine, Jethro. Wish l had my coat.
- Enough.

32:54.944 --> 32:57.489
<i>One car. One agent in the back.</i>

32:57.655 --> 32:59.782
Drugs in the trunk. Brian drives.

33:00.658 --> 33:02.494
<i>See you in 45 minutes.</i>

33:02.660 --> 33:04.078
<i>Where are we driving?</i>

33:04.996 --> 33:07.665
Leave that to my brother.
He knows where.

33:08.208 --> 33:09.793
<i>Don't be late.</i>

33:21.055 --> 33:23.432
Boss, Dempsey made the call
over a VOlP system.

33:23.599 --> 33:24.975
That's voice-over lnternet protocol.

33:25.142 --> 33:27.603
lt's a wireless signal
converted to analogue.

33:27.812 --> 33:29.522
How long to trace it, McGee?

33:29.688 --> 33:31.190
Three hours,
maybe two if l'm lucky.

33:31.357 --> 33:34.109
- He said 45 minutes, probie.
- Find another way.

33:34.276 --> 33:36.570
How, Gibbs? The only person
who knows where they are is dead.

33:36.779 --> 33:39.240
Did Brian Dempsey say anything
to you before you killed him?

33:39.406 --> 33:41.659
l mean, before he collapsed and died
while in your custody?

33:41.826 --> 33:44.745
l told you once, l did not kill that man,
so stop making accusations that--

33:44.912 --> 33:47.998
Hey. She said she wanted her coat.

33:48.165 --> 33:50.251
ls she trying to tell us something?

33:50.417 --> 33:52.503
Maybe she's cold.

33:53.254 --> 33:56.382
- Someplace cold.
- She left something in her coat?

34:03.556 --> 34:04.932
She left it on the plane.

34:06.725 --> 34:09.436
- She's at an airport.
- How do you know she's at an air--?

34:10.353 --> 34:12.523
Of course. She's at an airport.

34:12.690 --> 34:15.734
Pulling up every airport
in a 45-minute drive from here.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.152
Gibbs.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.737
There's gotta be at least a dozen.

34:18.904 --> 34:20.822
We'll never have time
to sweep them all.

34:20.989 --> 34:23.284
Maybe we won't have to.
DiNozzo, McGee, with me.

34:23.492 --> 34:25.494
On your six, boss.

34:29.540 --> 34:31.500
l got the results back
from Brian Dempsey's shoe goo.

34:31.958 --> 34:35.545
lt's a smorgasbord of Juicy Fruit,
chewing tobacco, dog poo--

34:35.713 --> 34:37.255
What's the point, Abby?

34:37.422 --> 34:41.092
There are also trace elements
of diolane and hexylene glycol.

34:41.302 --> 34:42.844
lt's fire suppression foam.

34:43.012 --> 34:46.389
So l'm thinking a manufacturing plant
or a firehouse--

34:46.556 --> 34:49.893
- Abby, they're at an airport.
- Or an airport.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.730
Because they use it on the runway
for emergency landings.

34:52.897 --> 34:54.607
You remember a few weeks ago,

34:54.773 --> 34:57.610
there was a commuter plane
with faulty landing gear?

34:57.776 --> 35:00.988
Yeah, we watched it on ZNN waiting
to see if it was gonna crash and burn.

35:01.155 --> 35:04.450
- lt was diverted to a small airfield.
- Which one, McGee?

35:10.581 --> 35:12.166
lt's Potomac Air--

35:12.333 --> 35:14.502
The Potomac Airfield.

35:16.504 --> 35:18.506
Got the airport layout, Gibbs.

35:19.423 --> 35:20.758
l recommend we seal it off,

35:20.925 --> 35:22.426
go through with tactical assault.

35:22.593 --> 35:25.054
lt's an airfield.
Do you expect to sneak up on him?

35:25.221 --> 35:27.014
We don't exactly have a choice.
lf his brother--

35:27.181 --> 35:29.058
Wasn't dead?
l think we've established that.

35:29.225 --> 35:31.310
David's right. We go in small.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.396
Cassie, McGee, find out what building
they're holding the director in.

35:34.563 --> 35:37.441
- How?
- l don't care, McGee. Trace the call.

35:37.608 --> 35:39.860
Find out what planes are scheduled
to take off. Just find it.

35:40.027 --> 35:41.612
On it.

35:41.779 --> 35:43.280
Hey.

35:43.656 --> 35:46.450
Hey. Come on.

35:47.076 --> 35:50.454
One problem, boss.
He's expecting his brother to drive.

35:50.621 --> 35:53.457
Well, then we give him what he wants.
We give him his brother.

35:58.796 --> 36:01.340
- Well l guess l should thank you.
- For what?

36:02.174 --> 36:03.676
Him.

36:04.301 --> 36:07.721
Friends are important, but in the end,
family's all we really have.

36:07.930 --> 36:10.015
Alex never understood that.

36:10.182 --> 36:12.143
You did me a favour.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.520
Well, let me do you another one.

36:14.979 --> 36:18.566
You're a smart guy, James.
You know this isn't gonna end well.

36:19.150 --> 36:21.193
They are going to kill you.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.320
Maybe even your brother.

36:23.487 --> 36:26.740
Are you willing to risk Brian's life?

36:26.991 --> 36:28.409
Well, that all depends.

36:28.826 --> 36:31.287
ls NClS willing to risk yours?

36:33.205 --> 36:35.749
You try something like that
with me again,

36:36.667 --> 36:39.962
l will send you back in little pieces.

36:50.723 --> 36:53.350
This is the second stupidest thing
l've ever done.

36:53.517 --> 36:54.768
Want to know what the first was?

36:55.561 --> 36:58.189
No. Less talking.

36:58.355 --> 37:01.859
Right. We should just tape the dead
guy's hands to the steering wheel.

37:02.026 --> 37:03.360
On it, boss.

37:03.527 --> 37:06.822
Here we go. lt's showtime, Bernie.

37:07.364 --> 37:08.866
lt's 3 and 1 1 .

37:09.074 --> 37:10.868
2 and 1 0.

37:11.410 --> 37:13.788
And that explains a lot.
Okay, all right.

37:13.996 --> 37:16.957
l need you to hold his head up here,
all right?

37:17.750 --> 37:18.834
<i>- McGee?
- Yeah, boss.</i>

37:19.043 --> 37:20.878
We're at the airport.
Got my location yet?

37:21.045 --> 37:24.048
l'm still working on the trace, boss.
We've localised the DNS servers.

37:24.215 --> 37:27.551
Having a little bit of trouble matching
the computer's profile to the subnet's.

37:27.718 --> 37:28.886
<i>Cassie. What about you?</i>

37:29.053 --> 37:31.096
l need every scheduled flight--

37:31.305 --> 37:33.098
No, today's flight plans.

37:33.265 --> 37:35.059
Boss, she's still working
on the flight plans.

37:35.226 --> 37:37.186
Work faster.

37:37.353 --> 37:39.647
They never had this much trouble
with Bernie.

37:39.855 --> 37:41.440
Who the hell is Bernie?

37:41.607 --> 37:43.400
<i>Weekend at Bernie's.
A cinematic masterpiece.</i>

37:43.609 --> 37:47.446
lt's, you know, blend of the comedic
and the--

37:47.655 --> 37:49.448
Thumbs down from the boss man.

37:49.615 --> 37:50.950
We're out of time.

37:51.116 --> 37:54.245
Gibbs, the only non-commercial aircraft
cleared to leave Potomac is from--

37:54.411 --> 37:57.373
- Hangar number three.
- We're sending out the coordinates.

37:58.124 --> 38:01.252
Are you sure this isn't the stupidest
thing you've ever done, DiNozzo?

38:01.418 --> 38:02.920
We're ready to go.

38:03.462 --> 38:04.463
Time's up.

38:13.514 --> 38:14.515
You were right.

38:16.142 --> 38:18.686
Looks like your people don't care
about you after all.

38:19.103 --> 38:20.813
l told you.

38:20.980 --> 38:24.608
NClS does not negotiate
with criminals, James.

38:25.484 --> 38:29.780
Well, you better hope they're willing
to make an exception for you.

38:31.907 --> 38:34.452
Are you trying to make me sick
or something, Tony?

38:34.618 --> 38:36.370
You know what,
l can't see out the windshield.

38:36.579 --> 38:40.082
l'm driving with my hands and
l still think l'm driving better than you.

38:40.249 --> 38:41.333
To the left.

38:41.834 --> 38:42.918
The other left.

38:45.004 --> 38:47.840
lt's hard to concentrate when your
head is three inches from a guy's--

38:48.007 --> 38:49.258
- Watch out!
- Which way?

38:49.425 --> 38:51.385
You're driving straight into
an airplane hangar.

38:51.552 --> 38:53.429
Could you be a little more specific?
Which way?

38:53.596 --> 38:54.930
Make a left.

38:56.015 --> 38:57.850
Now go straight.

38:58.017 --> 38:59.560
Tony, straight.

39:06.358 --> 39:08.903
Looks like your people came through
for you after all.

39:09.069 --> 39:10.988
So you're home free.

39:11.155 --> 39:12.990
l'm not stupid.

39:13.157 --> 39:15.201
l know they'll have people following.

39:15.367 --> 39:19.121
But in five minutes, l'll be 25,000 feet
over the Atlantic. Get up.

39:26.337 --> 39:29.298
- You see him?
- Not yet.

39:29.465 --> 39:31.842
Just remember,
Gibbs doesn't want you taking a shot

39:32.009 --> 39:34.345
until the director's clear.

39:46.982 --> 39:49.944
You, out of the car.

39:53.864 --> 39:55.115
Hands on your head.

40:07.628 --> 40:10.756
Cuff yourself.
Hands behind your back.

40:12.383 --> 40:13.759
l said, cuff yourself.

40:23.477 --> 40:25.187
Now lie down.

40:33.445 --> 40:34.446
Very clever.

40:38.951 --> 40:42.121
Brian, get the drugs
and take them on the plane.

40:42.288 --> 40:43.622
They're right behind you.

40:48.252 --> 40:50.588
Get the damn drugs, Brian.

40:52.339 --> 40:53.841
Brian.

40:58.429 --> 41:00.973
They killed him.
You killed my baby brother.

41:19.074 --> 41:21.035
lt's actually a pretty interesting story.

41:37.259 --> 41:39.053
l'm fine, Jethro.

41:39.470 --> 41:41.222
Really.

41:42.890 --> 41:46.727
lt's a probie mistake.
l should have known better.

41:46.936 --> 41:48.813
Never should have let my guard down.

41:48.979 --> 41:51.440
How many times have we said that?

41:54.985 --> 41:56.821
Stanley was a hell of an agent.

41:56.987 --> 41:58.823
He didn't deserve this.

41:58.989 --> 42:00.157
And l know what you're gonna say.

42:00.366 --> 42:03.160
l'm the director now,
it comes with the territory.

42:03.327 --> 42:05.496
But l hope to God
l never get used to it.

42:14.922 --> 42:17.049
Are you ever gonna say anything?

42:18.175 --> 42:19.677
Have a drink.

42:19.844 --> 42:23.514
l have the results of Brian Dempsey's
neuropath report.

42:23.681 --> 42:27.351
The haemorrhaging was caused
by a congenital defect

42:27.518 --> 42:30.187
in the subarachnoid artery.

42:30.354 --> 42:32.022
He died of a brain aneurism?

42:32.189 --> 42:33.774
Present since birth.

42:33.941 --> 42:35.693
The young man
was a walking time bomb.

42:35.860 --> 42:37.820
Every time bomb
has a trigger, Duck.

42:38.654 --> 42:43.576
Well, anything could have
precipitated his death.

42:43.742 --> 42:45.411
A cough, a sneeze.

42:45.578 --> 42:47.872
A blow to the throat?

42:52.460 --> 42:54.462
Sounds like natural causes to me.

42:56.589 --> 42:58.799
Exactly the way l ruled it.
