00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:05.426 --> 00:08.339
Mom, I know you have
a lot on your plate right now--

00:08.339 --> 00:10.971
And yet I still feel that's not
the end of your sentence.

00:10.971 --> 00:13.134
But I need you to give me
a ride to Boston this weekend.

00:13.134 --> 00:15.846
Why? Is that the first stop
on your comedy tour?

00:15.846 --> 00:17.308
Because that's hilarious.
Sorry, honey,

00:17.308 --> 00:19.480
but Dad's out of town
with Georgie and Daphne,

00:19.480 --> 00:20.901
and I just don't
have time.

00:20.901 --> 00:22.733
It's no big deal.

00:22.733 --> 00:24.855
All we have to do
is drop everything,

00:24.855 --> 00:26.487
load up the rest of the kids,
drive two hours in traffic

00:26.487 --> 00:28.149
there and back...

00:28.149 --> 00:31.862
Now that I hear it,
even I'm not convinced.

00:34.655 --> 00:38.869
Not being able to drive myself
is driving myself crazy.

00:38.869 --> 00:40.711
Hold on.

00:40.711 --> 00:43.504
Rachel's already got
her permit.

00:43.504 --> 00:45.086
If she gets her license,

00:45.086 --> 00:47.378
she could be
my ticket out of here.

00:47.378 --> 00:49.510
And every kid wants
their license.

00:49.510 --> 00:51.382
I don't want my license.

00:51.382 --> 00:54.475
Why? Don't you want
your freedom?

00:54.475 --> 00:56.637
Yes, and that's exactly
what I'd be giving up.

00:58.519 --> 01:00.681
Thanks for driving Lewie
and Beast to the petting
zoo for me.

01:00.681 --> 01:02.443
How'd they like it?

01:02.443 --> 01:05.355
Not as much as the llama
liked my sweater.

01:08.529 --> 01:10.691
You're forgetting about
the up side.

01:13.494 --> 01:16.197
What a day.
I hit 18 malls,

01:16.197 --> 01:18.459
three outlets,
and a designer sample sale.

01:18.459 --> 01:20.791
This sweater was made
for Gigi Hadid.

01:23.544 --> 01:26.127
And if you have
your driver's license,

01:26.127 --> 01:28.919
I have an inside line to
two VIP passes

01:28.919 --> 01:30.591
to the jammin'-est,
slammin'-est

01:30.591 --> 01:32.883
outdoor music fest
in all of New England.

01:32.883 --> 01:34.425
Jam Slam?

01:34.425 --> 01:36.427
You have to know someone
to get those tickets,

01:36.427 --> 01:39.180
and I know everyone
you know, and you know no one.
How do you have them?

01:39.180 --> 01:42.483
Jam Slam picked
my invention for their
finals in their contest.

01:42.483 --> 01:45.146
Winners get VIP passes.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.729
And when I do, bam,
we're rockin' at Jam Slam.

01:48.729 --> 01:52.153
Okay, so recapping,
cocky attitude, check.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.534
Tickets, not so check.

01:53.534 --> 01:55.736
You haven't won
anything yet.

01:55.736 --> 01:57.948
I will when the judges
see this.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.543
The H2 Whoa.

02:02.543 --> 02:04.745
On one end, water bottle.

02:04.745 --> 02:09.250
Other end, a multi-purpose
tool for all of your
outdoor concert needs.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.302
A built-in
sunscreen dispenser,

02:11.302 --> 02:14.054
a fan to cool you off,
and a mirror to glam you up.

02:15.966 --> 02:18.429
I can't tell
if you like it or not.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.811
Sorry. I got distracted by
my own reflection.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.023
That thing is bomb.

02:23.023 --> 02:24.815
And the best part is,

02:24.815 --> 02:26.977
the winning invention goes in
every performer's swag bag

02:26.977 --> 02:28.609
at next year's event.

02:28.609 --> 02:31.232
I'm in. I better go out
and get a new outfit.

02:31.232 --> 02:33.113
You need to get
your license first.

02:33.113 --> 02:35.406
I meant for the driving test.

02:37.278 --> 02:39.159
Sorry, drivers of America.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.372
Rachel's getting her license.

02:41.372 --> 02:43.244
It's time to celebrate.

02:45.416 --> 02:48.589
That's right.
It's also a glitter cannon.

02:50.961 --> 02:53.384
Too bad it's not
also a broom.

Mom, we found a way
to fix our problem.

03:48.609 --> 03:50.731
Don't worry, I called
the plumber this morning.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.853
But just to be safe,
keep flushing twice.

03:52.853 --> 03:56.236
No. Rachel's going to
drive me to Boston.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.238
As soon as the judges
see my H2 Whoa,

03:58.238 --> 04:00.120
we're going VIP
to Jam Slam.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.822
Okay, even the few words
in that sentence

04:01.822 --> 04:04.244
I did understand
confuse me.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.247
- Rachel doesn't
have her driver's license.
- Yet.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.630
I have an appointment
for a driver's test tomorrow,

04:09.630 --> 04:11.752
but I need an adult
in the car with me.

04:11.752 --> 04:16.136
Someone who's smart,
accomplished, powerful.

04:16.136 --> 04:18.589
Still sort of cute if
she actually tried.

04:18.589 --> 04:21.221
Not so great with
the sweet talk, are you?

04:21.221 --> 04:23.764
Fine. I'll take you,
but only because

04:23.764 --> 04:25.436
I can cash in those guilt points
with your father.

04:25.436 --> 04:27.388
Oh, I also need to do
some practice.

04:27.388 --> 04:28.769
Cash them in
if I live that long.

04:34.945 --> 04:36.607
Congratulations, boys.

04:36.607 --> 04:38.238
I'm casting you two as
the leads

04:38.238 --> 04:39.990
for my final project
in film class.

04:39.990 --> 04:42.743
You'll be perfect.
You were born to be stars.

04:42.743 --> 04:45.616
Waited till the last
minute again, didn't you?

04:45.616 --> 04:47.578
This is getting to be
a real problem.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.790
I don't need a lecture
from two guys

04:49.790 --> 04:51.672
who just got their heads
stuck in the stair banister.

04:51.672 --> 04:54.545
Beast got his stuck.
I was just keeping him company.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.087
Come on, guys. I can't
flunk at the one thing

04:57.087 --> 04:58.509
I'm supposed to be
good at.

04:58.509 --> 05:01.762
File that under
Ethan's problem.

05:01.762 --> 05:04.264
But you'd be the perfect
leads for my buddy cop film.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.689
Buddy cops, you say?

05:08.689 --> 05:10.601
Yeah. A couple of
tough cops

05:10.601 --> 05:12.062
who answer to
nobody but themselves.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.854
Lewie, you'd be
Detective Frank Jay.

05:13.854 --> 05:17.277
And Beast, you're
Detective Marco Peeby.

05:17.277 --> 05:19.239
And together,
you're Peeby and Jay.

05:19.239 --> 05:20.861
Clever, huh?

05:20.861 --> 05:22.703
I would've gone
a different way.

05:22.703 --> 05:24.995
So what do you say?

05:24.995 --> 05:26.367
Help a brother out?

05:26.367 --> 05:28.248
I'll have to talk
to my agent.

05:30.871 --> 05:33.874
We want our own trailers
and hair stylists.

05:33.874 --> 05:35.456
I'll give you
two dead batteries

05:35.456 --> 05:37.668
- and a handful of candy.
- Done.

05:38.759 --> 05:40.631
If I'm banking
my Jam Slam prize

05:40.631 --> 05:44.014
on Rachel, I figured a little
practice couldn't hurt anything.

05:44.014 --> 05:46.517
Except for maybe
Mom's sanity.

05:46.517 --> 05:48.469
Can we go already?

05:48.469 --> 05:49.850
I'm just covering
all our bases.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.732
Let me put this on.

05:51.732 --> 05:53.974
Mom, relax.

05:53.974 --> 05:55.816
I've practiced some
with Dad.

05:55.816 --> 05:57.237
I'm good.

05:57.237 --> 05:59.279
Last time we went,
he kept his eyes open

05:59.279 --> 06:00.481
almost the whole time.

06:00.481 --> 06:02.483
I'm relaxed. Okay.

06:02.483 --> 06:03.904
Everybody, buckle
your seatbelts.

06:06.787 --> 06:08.699
Make sure it's secure.

06:08.699 --> 06:10.661
It clicked, right?
Did it click?

06:10.661 --> 06:13.454
You heard a click?
Did yours click?

06:13.454 --> 06:14.955
I'm starting the car.

06:18.799 --> 06:20.000
It's go time.

Wow. If this was
a real driver's test, you...

07:15.726 --> 07:18.729
Nailed it. Yeah.

07:23.153 --> 07:26.697
Oh. I guess we need
those to get home.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.745
Looking good, boys.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.376
You have the right
to remain talented.

07:36.376 --> 07:40.290
( giggling ) I kid.
Now remember,

07:40.290 --> 07:43.343
you've been investigating
this diamond heist
for six months.

07:43.343 --> 07:45.546
You've just found
your first big clue.

07:45.546 --> 07:48.679
The villain's signature
purple handkerchief.

07:52.853 --> 07:54.935
So Lewie
picks it up first,

07:54.935 --> 07:57.938
and Beast will
take off his glasses and say,

07:57.938 --> 08:01.522
"Somebody's about to get
a taste of Peeby and Jay."

08:01.522 --> 08:04.655
Got it?
And... action.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.783
Cut! What's the matter?
I thought you two were ready.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.996
Somebody's about
to get a taste...

08:15.996 --> 08:18.789
Not now.
When the camera's rolling.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.001
Yeah, do we have to do this
with the camera rolling?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.253
I'm much looser
without it.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.886
Wonder if it's too late
to make this an animated film.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.222
Okay, time for some
last-minute cramming.

08:33.222 --> 08:36.096
Rachel, what do you do when
you reach a blind intersection?

08:36.096 --> 08:38.849
Come to a complete stop,
and proceed when clear.

08:38.849 --> 08:41.852
- Mom?
- Close my eyes
and think of rainbows.

08:41.852 --> 08:42.852
You'll both do great.

08:44.985 --> 08:45.946
Oh, here comes
the instructor.

08:45.946 --> 08:47.698
Hi.

08:47.698 --> 08:48.909
I'll be your...

08:48.909 --> 08:50.991
Suzy.
Is that you?

08:50.991 --> 08:54.034
Oh, my gosh.
Phil Durning?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.496
Oh, it's been forever.

08:56.496 --> 08:58.418
Girls, you're not
gonna believe this,

08:58.418 --> 09:01.251
but Phil and I went to
high school together.

09:01.251 --> 09:02.873
Phil, these are
my daughters.

09:02.873 --> 09:04.665
Harley and Rachel.

09:04.665 --> 09:07.547
Pleasure.
Wow, time goes by fast.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.591
- How is it that
you have two kids?
- Actually, she has--

09:10.591 --> 09:12.803
Limited time, so let's
get this show on the road.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.885
Show on the road.
I'm using that one.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.438
Looks like we have an in.

09:18.438 --> 09:20.681
I'm gonna go
butter him up a little.

09:23.023 --> 09:25.315
Good. Let Mom do
the sweet talking.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.649
Based on his khakis,
I don't know if I could.

09:30.030 --> 09:31.742
This is the longest
ten minutes of my life

09:31.742 --> 09:33.243
waiting for Rachel
to take her road test.

09:33.243 --> 09:35.035
Oh, the moment of truth.

09:35.035 --> 09:38.498
Pass or fail, it will all
be written on Rachel's face.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.664
Strong posture
represents confidence.

09:43.664 --> 09:45.966
Looking him in the eye
nodding.

09:45.966 --> 09:48.709
Also a good sign.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.300
I think it's safe to say...

09:52.052 --> 09:53.804
That I have no ability
to read people.

09:57.267 --> 09:59.559
That one was an accident.

10:03.433 --> 10:05.435
I don't get it.

10:05.435 --> 10:07.227
I stayed within
the speed limit,

10:07.227 --> 10:09.319
my parallel parking
was crazy parallel,

10:09.319 --> 10:11.992
I even nailed every point
in my three-point turn.

10:11.992 --> 10:15.155
Yeah. How did that
go wrong?

10:15.155 --> 10:17.077
Mom knew the instructor.

10:17.077 --> 10:20.580
And we all know Mom's
great at buttering people up.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.082
Wow!

10:22.082 --> 10:25.876
Another day's mail
safely delivered.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.128
And look at those arms.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.880
Where was your last stop,
the gym?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.252
Hey, since it's
on your route,

10:32.252 --> 10:34.715
would you mind dropping
these off at the dry cleaners?

10:34.715 --> 10:36.636
Light starch is fine.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.059
Thanks.

10:39.059 --> 10:41.221
That was basically
our mailman in a car

10:41.221 --> 10:43.063
with worse pants.

10:43.063 --> 10:44.524
He should've been putty
in Mom's hands.

10:44.524 --> 10:46.937
Maybe he's mad at her.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.899
Maybe something went down
in high school

10:48.899 --> 10:50.440
Mom's not telling us.

10:53.573 --> 10:56.907
"Suzy, sorry things
didn't work out."

10:56.907 --> 10:58.118
What does that mean?

10:58.118 --> 10:59.910
Check out his likes
and dislikes.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.992
Favorite singer,
Meat Loaf.

11:01.992 --> 11:05.335
That must be a typo.

11:06.837 --> 11:08.959
All right,
let me set the scene.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.091
You've been on stakeout
for 24 hours.

11:11.091 --> 11:13.293
You haven't eaten or slept.

11:13.293 --> 11:15.005
You're vulnerable,
emotions are bubbling up.

11:15.005 --> 11:16.506
Make me believe it.

11:16.506 --> 11:19.389
And action.

11:19.389 --> 11:24.184
( monotone ) I just found out
my kid made the academy.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.766
I'm so proud.

11:25.766 --> 11:27.938
( monotone )
My wife just left me.

11:27.938 --> 11:30.150
I've got nothing
but the job.

11:30.150 --> 11:31.862
Cut.

11:31.862 --> 11:34.484
- Somebody's about
to get a taste--
- No.

11:34.484 --> 11:36.406
Not catchphrase time.

11:36.406 --> 11:38.158
And remember, Beast,
in this scene,

11:38.158 --> 11:41.121
you're supposed to be happy,
and Lewie,

11:41.121 --> 11:43.083
in this scene,
you're supposed to be sad.

11:43.083 --> 11:45.125
I'm sorry.
Is that not reading?

11:45.125 --> 11:46.957
Look, sad is this.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.829
Try it.

11:50.420 --> 11:54.334
Beast,
happy looks like this.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.508
This feels right.

11:58.508 --> 12:01.051
Guys, you're killin' me.
I need authenticity.

12:01.051 --> 12:03.223
It's like you've never been
happy or sad before.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.188
All right, let's try this
one more time.

12:08.188 --> 12:10.230
Oh, and by the way,
Beast, when we're done,

12:10.230 --> 12:11.852
I'm taking you out
for ice cream.

12:12.903 --> 12:15.565
Oh, sorry, Lewie.
None for you.

12:15.565 --> 12:18.238
Also, your pet turtle died.
And action.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.451
( excitedly ) I just found out
my kid made the academy!

12:21.451 --> 12:23.573
I'm so proud.

12:23.573 --> 12:25.786
( sadly ) My wife
just left me.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.577
I've got nothing
but the job.

12:27.577 --> 12:30.000
Cut. Very nice.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.082
Wait. I don't have
a pet turtle.

12:32.082 --> 12:33.293
Movin' on!

12:33.293 --> 12:35.836
"Sorry things
didn't work out."

12:35.836 --> 12:38.799
Is there something
you'd like to tell us?

12:38.799 --> 12:41.381
Yeah. I know I never showed
an interest in your past before,

12:41.381 --> 12:43.223
but I wanna know
about this.

12:43.223 --> 12:45.886
Phil had a thing for me
back in high school,

12:45.886 --> 12:47.147
and I didn't
like him back.

12:47.147 --> 12:49.349
Phil can really
hold a grudge.

12:49.349 --> 12:51.021
He failed French
junior year,

12:51.021 --> 12:52.772
never ate fries again.

12:55.355 --> 12:57.898
A grudge for
all these years?

12:57.898 --> 12:59.569
There's gotta be
something more.

12:59.569 --> 13:02.072
Yeah. Did you insult
his mother

13:02.072 --> 13:04.364
say his house smelled
like hard-boiled eggs

13:04.364 --> 13:06.997
or flirt with his older
brother to make him jealous?

13:06.997 --> 13:09.329
I'm just thinking of
things I did to Cuff.

13:09.329 --> 13:13.173
Mom, think. I know high school
was a crazy long time ago,

13:13.173 --> 13:15.085
but you've gotta
remember something.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.007
Now who's bad
with the sweet talk?

13:17.007 --> 13:20.050
Fine, but it's
embarrassing.
( sighs )

13:20.050 --> 13:22.682
He's made because
he gave me a gift

13:22.682 --> 13:24.554
- and I never returned it.
- What gift?

13:24.554 --> 13:26.636
That captain's wheel.

13:29.189 --> 13:32.853
He gave you
that ugly thing?

13:32.853 --> 13:34.234
You are the one
who should be mad.

13:34.234 --> 13:36.276
It was from
Phil's family boat.

13:36.276 --> 13:39.319
In his words, he no longer
needed a steering wheel.

13:40.740 --> 13:43.363
Because my heart
would lead the way.

13:43.363 --> 13:45.445
He said that?!

13:45.445 --> 13:47.908
Again, you're the one
who should be mad.

13:47.908 --> 13:49.449
Cuff never gave me a wheel.

13:49.449 --> 13:52.252
A hubcap once,
but never a wheel.

13:52.252 --> 13:54.294
Anyway, my heart
didn't lead the way,

13:54.294 --> 13:56.877
I never returned the wheel,
and Phil flunked you.

13:56.877 --> 13:59.049
Now you know all of it.
I'm sorry.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.302
This really stinks.

14:02.302 --> 14:04.965
There are no more
road tests before Friday.

14:04.965 --> 14:08.348
I guess we aren't
going to Jam Slam.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.230
It's over.

14:12.392 --> 14:14.354
I think we all
know me well enough

14:14.354 --> 14:16.316
to see that
this is not over.

14:16.316 --> 14:18.318
I'm not going to let
some stupid captain's wheel

14:18.318 --> 14:20.690
keep me away from
Jam Slam.

14:20.690 --> 14:23.693
If there was only
some way to reunite it

14:23.693 --> 14:26.156
with its original owner.

14:29.249 --> 14:31.201
Dear Phil, it's Mom.

14:31.201 --> 14:34.164
Nope. Delete, delete, delete.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.336
It's Suzy.

14:36.336 --> 14:38.208
It was nice
seeing you again.

14:38.208 --> 14:41.421
We gotta get this done
before Mom gets home.

14:41.421 --> 14:43.763
I added a lot of items
to our grocery list,

14:43.763 --> 14:46.266
but it'll only take her
so long to figure out

14:46.266 --> 14:47.767
organic fake tofu
isn't a thing.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.269
Phil just parked.

14:49.269 --> 14:51.351
Took him three tries
to squeeze in that spot,

14:51.351 --> 14:53.513
and he failed me?!
What a joke.

14:57.727 --> 15:00.610
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming by.

15:00.610 --> 15:02.192
Did you find
the house okay?

15:02.192 --> 15:03.984
Any trouble parking?

15:03.984 --> 15:05.655
Rachel!

15:05.655 --> 15:08.118
Uh, is your mother home?
She invited me over.

15:08.118 --> 15:10.120
Right. There's something
she wanted to give you.

15:12.582 --> 15:14.244
What's this?

15:14.244 --> 15:16.336
The captain's wheel you gave
her back in high school.

15:16.336 --> 15:18.248
The symbol of
your lost love.

15:18.248 --> 15:20.500
The reason why you
burned me on that test.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.252
And maybe now, you can
find a way

15:22.252 --> 15:24.464
to fit Rachel into
your schedule for a re-test.

15:24.464 --> 15:27.467
It took me three stores, but
I found your organic fake tofu.

15:27.467 --> 15:29.889
What's going on?

15:29.889 --> 15:31.811
- Phil, what are you
doing here?
- Okay, Mom,

15:31.811 --> 15:33.974
I know this is
a surprise,

15:33.974 --> 15:37.357
but we were trying
to help Phil heal.

15:37.357 --> 15:39.689
From that hole
you put in his heart
all those years ago.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.611
What hole?
My heart's fine.

15:41.611 --> 15:45.235
High blood pressure, but just
part of the driving game.

15:45.235 --> 15:48.448
And I've never seen
that wheel before
in my life.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.370
- Wait. What?
- I knew it.

15:50.370 --> 15:53.373
Mom was hot in high school,
but not captain's wheel hot.

15:58.288 --> 15:59.709
You made up that whole lie
about the captain's wheel?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.751
But if Phil didn't have
a grudge against you,

16:01.751 --> 16:04.254
why did he say no
when you asked him for a favor?

16:04.254 --> 16:06.296
He didn't say no.

16:06.296 --> 16:08.548
From one old friend
to another,

16:08.548 --> 16:12.262
maybe it's best if my daughter
doesn't pass the test.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.144
I just don't think
she's ready yet.

16:15.515 --> 16:17.357
But why?

16:17.357 --> 16:18.978
I studied,
I practiced.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.900
You saw how good
of a driver I was.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.063
Yeah, Mom.
While we were practicing,

16:23.063 --> 16:25.275
she passed two
shoe clearance sales

16:25.275 --> 16:28.408
and didn't even look.
She was totally ready.

16:28.408 --> 16:30.870
I know she was.

16:30.870 --> 16:33.493
- It was me who wasn't.
- What?

16:33.493 --> 16:36.956
When I saw you guys
standing there all set to go,

16:36.956 --> 16:38.458
it hit me.

16:38.458 --> 16:41.461
As much as I complain about
driving you all around,

16:41.461 --> 16:44.084
sometimes those
20 minutes in the car

16:44.084 --> 16:45.465
are the only times
we get to share.

16:45.465 --> 16:48.088
It is kind of like
a metal confessional booth.

16:48.088 --> 16:50.180
I was gonna say
rolling jail cell,

16:50.180 --> 16:51.891
but yours is nicer.

16:51.891 --> 16:53.683
Once you kids
start driving,

16:53.683 --> 16:58.188
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose all those little moments.

16:58.188 --> 16:59.979
And now I feel bad about
my jail cell thing.

16:59.979 --> 17:01.851
Don't worry, Mom.

17:01.851 --> 17:04.194
You'll probably have
Georgie for a while.

17:04.194 --> 17:08.027
I don't see her
passing her driver's test
the first dozen times.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.410
I'm sorry for letting
my sappiness

17:10.410 --> 17:12.452
get in the way of
your license.

17:12.452 --> 17:15.615
It's okay, Mom.
I'll just get it next month.

17:15.615 --> 17:18.998
Unless your friend would be
willing to squeeze Rachel in
before Friday.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.926
I knew I shouldn't
have stayed for these cookies.

17:35.135 --> 17:37.597
Okay, guys, you've
successfully tracked the villain

17:37.597 --> 17:39.729
with the purple handkerchief
down to the loading docks.

17:39.729 --> 17:41.311
But your partnership
is falling apart.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.772
Oh, and by the way,

17:42.772 --> 17:44.394
Beast, Lewie cleaned his ear
with your toothbrush.

17:44.394 --> 17:46.566
Lewie, Beast said
you're a poopy pants.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.778
Action.

17:48.778 --> 17:51.321
How could you
steal my lady?

17:51.321 --> 17:53.363
Gloria was
everything to me.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.615
You've got a lot of nerve,
buddy boy.

17:55.615 --> 17:58.788
This ain't the time, Peeby.
We've got a villain
on the loose.

17:58.788 --> 18:00.580
And Gloria's
my lady now.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.622
We can do this two ways.

18:02.622 --> 18:04.504
Creamy or crunchy.

18:04.504 --> 18:07.046
Cut.
Where's that in the script?

18:07.046 --> 18:10.049
It's not. I just feel like
my character would say that.

18:10.049 --> 18:11.841
What do you mean,
 your character?

18:11.841 --> 18:13.883
And if Peeby has
his own catchphrase,

18:13.883 --> 18:16.476
shouldn't Jay have one, too?
Something like,

18:16.476 --> 18:19.479
We can do this two ways.

18:19.479 --> 18:21.851
Grape or marmalade.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.893
Okay, these aren't
the characters I created.

18:23.893 --> 18:26.606
You? We are
these characters.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.228
We've experienced
all their emotions.

18:28.228 --> 18:31.491
Happy, sad,
the other ones.

18:31.491 --> 18:33.613
It's true. I don't know
where I end

18:33.613 --> 18:35.535
and Marco Peeby begins.

18:35.535 --> 18:38.238
Look, I've got ten minutes
before a bread truck comes in

18:38.238 --> 18:40.620
and parks in our set,
so let's go, monkeys.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.001
Just do what I say.

18:42.001 --> 18:43.623
No dice, director man.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.336
Like you said, we're just
a couple of tough cops

18:46.336 --> 18:48.087
who answer to
nobody but ourselves.

18:48.087 --> 18:51.421
Yeah. In fact, hit the bricks.
You're fired.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.963
Fired? You don't
exist without me.

18:53.963 --> 18:55.965
Says you.
Come on, Peeby.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.467
Let's jam.

18:59.889 --> 19:03.313
Jay doesn't have
a catchphrase.

19:03.313 --> 19:06.936
The one thing
I don't get is,

19:06.936 --> 19:08.478
why did you sign
Mom's yearbook

19:08.478 --> 19:10.480
"Sorry things
didn't work out"?

19:10.480 --> 19:13.483
- Why did I do that?
- Mmm.

19:13.483 --> 19:15.575
Oh, I think your mom
was supposed to come over

19:15.575 --> 19:19.199
and watch Lethal Weapon 3,
 but my VCR broke.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.700
Just as well.

19:20.700 --> 19:24.374
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a buddy cop movie.

19:24.374 --> 19:27.046
So now that I've shown
I'm still crazy

19:27.046 --> 19:29.499
after all these years,

19:29.499 --> 19:32.552
is there any chance you can
give Rachel a re-test
before the weekend?

19:32.552 --> 19:36.846
Well, I'd hate to have Harley
miss her invention contest.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.888
And a killer
music festival.

19:38.888 --> 19:40.890
Let's focus on
the non-party one, Rachel.

19:40.890 --> 19:42.642
I suppose I could
fit you in

19:42.642 --> 19:45.265
at the end of
the day tomorrow.

19:45.265 --> 19:46.976
Yes!

19:46.976 --> 19:49.859
Oh, thanks for being
so nice about this, Phil.

19:49.859 --> 19:51.651
Ah, no problem.

19:51.651 --> 19:54.574
Families like this--
it's the reason you do the job.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.317
Well, I'm gonna go get
some more cookies.

19:57.317 --> 20:00.029
Harley, why don't you show
him your invention?

20:01.911 --> 20:03.493
It's called the H2 Whoa.

20:03.493 --> 20:07.497
It has water, a fan,
sunscreen.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.709
Ow! My eyes!
Burning!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.671
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

20:11.671 --> 20:14.133
Ten more seconds
and this bomb goes off.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.175
Which wire do I cut?

20:16.175 --> 20:18.548
I don't know, but if
you pick the wrong one,

20:18.548 --> 20:21.511
this orphanage goes up
like a Roman candle.

20:21.511 --> 20:24.103
Hands off
my inventions.

20:27.557 --> 20:30.560
Well, guess we'll have to
defuse the hair dryer.

20:33.062 --> 20:35.565
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.567
My brothers must've
tampered with the...

20:37.567 --> 20:38.948
Oh!

20:38.948 --> 20:41.120
- Oh, glitter!
- Okay.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.822
I will get you a towel.

20:42.822 --> 20:44.954
Though a clean one
might take a minute.

20:44.954 --> 20:47.707
Uh... here.

20:47.707 --> 20:48.498
Use this.

20:51.130 --> 20:52.962
Okay.

20:52.962 --> 20:54.584
- Do you see that?
- PHIL: Son of a gun.

20:54.584 --> 20:56.676
Purple handkerchief.

20:56.676 --> 20:58.298
Get him!!

21:03.303 --> 21:05.305
The perfect ending.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.097
RACHEL: What are you doing?!

21:11.100 --> 21:13.733
- Mom!!
- Guys, stop.

21:13.733 --> 21:14.984
Step back, ma'am.

21:14.984 --> 21:17.567
This is police business.

21:17.567 --> 21:22.161
Looks like someone just got
a taste of Peeby and Jay.

21:24.364 --> 21:27.166
Cut. Print. Perfect.

21:27.166 --> 21:29.749
Boys! Get off of him!

21:29.749 --> 21:32.001
What are you doing?!

21:34.754 --> 21:36.756
Can we do this
one more time?

21:36.756 --> 21:38.378
I'd love to get
some other angles.

21:43.383 --> 21:46.095
Thanks again for
driving us, Mom.

21:46.095 --> 21:48.768
No probs.

21:48.768 --> 21:50.810
You know,
I called around

21:50.810 --> 21:54.774
and there's a road test
available in Duxbury
next week.

21:54.774 --> 21:56.646
I'll take you if you want.

21:56.646 --> 21:58.438
You didn't date anyone
there, right?

22:03.613 --> 22:05.495
I hope I pass.

22:05.495 --> 22:06.906
You will.

22:06.906 --> 22:08.908
I'm pretty sure
you're ready.

22:12.952 --> 22:14.664
In a family like mine,

22:14.664 --> 22:16.716
it's easy to be in a hurry,

22:16.716 --> 22:19.509
trying to reach those
 big milestones in life--

22:19.509 --> 22:21.801
license, graduation,

22:21.801 --> 22:24.053
Nobel Prize
 for inventing.

22:24.053 --> 22:26.305
But no rush.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.267
There's still plenty of
 small moments to appreciate

22:28.267 --> 22:31.851
along the way.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.313
Most of the time.

22:34.313 --> 22:37.647
Okay, punk,
where'd you get that trophy?

22:37.647 --> 22:39.899
We can do this
three ways.

22:39.899 --> 22:41.401
Creamy, crunchy,

22:41.401 --> 22:43.823
or with a tall
glass of milk.

22:43.823 --> 22:47.286
Ethan, when are you going
to finish this movie?

22:47.286 --> 22:48.748
I finished two days ago.

22:48.748 --> 22:50.700
I can't get them to stop.

22:54.794 --> 22:56.836
HARLEY: Guys,
don't push that.

22:56.836 --> 22:58.588
( laughter)

22:58.588 --> 23:00.550
Never mind.

23:01.305 --> 23:07.905
