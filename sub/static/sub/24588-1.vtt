44:09.747 --> 44:12.849
- You know, we did know
each other in a past life.

44:12.850 --> 44:15.352
We were together, you and me.

44:17.287 --> 44:18.656
You were an awful man.

44:19.790 --> 44:21.324
- Now honey, be reasonable.

44:21.325 --> 44:24.193
You can't hold him
responsible for past lives.

44:24.194 --> 44:27.230
- No Eliot, he was horrible.

44:27.231 --> 44:28.931
He was a horrible, horrible man.

44:28.932 --> 44:31.768
- No no, I don't know
you, I don't know her.

44:31.769 --> 44:34.404
I've never, ever known you.
- Now honey, stop it.

44:34.405 --> 44:38.241
You're startling our guest,
you don't want him to leave.

44:38.242 --> 44:39.342
Not yet.

44:39.343 --> 44:42.345
Please, stay awhile longer,

44:42.346 --> 44:44.348
at least until the
authorities arrive.

47:02.352 --> 47:03.587
- It's amazing.

47:06.023 --> 47:08.258
- It's the solo of
being between lives.

47:09.561 --> 47:10.561
- What?

47:10.562 --> 47:16.366
- The true all and unyielding,
unleaking universe.

47:18.068 --> 47:21.471
- I don't understand.

47:29.046 --> 47:31.481
- Every dead thing has thoughts.

47:43.460 --> 47:45.229
- God, I'm so happy you're here.

47:46.096 --> 47:47.431
I've missed you so much.

47:49.933 --> 47:52.101
You're so beautiful.

47:52.102 --> 47:53.537
- Yours is a wounded happiness.

47:56.473 --> 48:00.109
- I still don't understand.

48:00.110 --> 48:01.144
- But how could you?

48:02.112 --> 48:03.247
You're already dead.

49:28.398 --> 49:30.968
- What the fuck is that thing?

49:32.202 --> 49:33.202
Why?

49:34.271 --> 49:36.039
Why are you guys
doing this to me?

49:39.276 --> 49:41.445
- It doesn't need a reason.

49:43.413 --> 49:45.648
- Because you're the mouse

49:45.649 --> 49:47.617
and we're the cat.

49:53.390 --> 49:54.691
You wanna play?

49:57.561 --> 49:59.062
Or should we finish it now?

50:11.241 --> 50:12.241
- I'm gonna kill you.

50:16.646 --> 50:18.148
- That's what they all say.

50:19.449 --> 50:21.718
- Come on, we've still
got miles to go.

51:22.412 --> 51:27.484
- Hey, in ya go.

51:33.690 --> 51:36.259
- Is it scared?
- Is it scared?

51:38.762 --> 51:40.396
- Watch your head,

51:40.397 --> 51:42.732
don't want you go get hurt.

51:45.268 --> 51:47.136
- The world is wrought

51:47.137 --> 51:49.206
with you fucking people.

51:50.707 --> 51:53.742
You think we're the bad guys?

51:53.743 --> 51:56.480
We're the fucking entertainment.

51:57.781 --> 52:01.117
- You think wearing a mask makes
you a fuckin' entertainer?

52:01.118 --> 52:03.587
- It's better than
being fucking boring.

52:04.754 --> 52:06.756
- You're fucking insane.
- I am insane.

52:07.724 --> 52:11.127
Boring Mr. Mouse, just like all

52:11.128 --> 52:13.729
the other boring fucking people.

52:13.730 --> 52:17.399
Weak-willed, pathetic, impotent,

52:17.400 --> 52:18.768
sick with desire

52:19.769 --> 52:22.671
and fastened to a dying animal.

52:22.672 --> 52:24.641
- Shut the fuck up!

52:47.797 --> 52:48.797
You see?

52:50.367 --> 52:52.769
That's fucking entertaining.

52:54.771 --> 52:57.374
That's what I want from you.

53:00.544 --> 53:01.544
Ha ha.

53:02.512 --> 53:03.747
Run Mr. Mouse,

53:04.648 --> 53:05.648
run!

54:27.631 --> 54:29.999
- Don't worry, calm down.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.434
They just think
you're joking around.

54:32.435 --> 54:34.670
What's the problem,
maybe I can help.

54:34.671 --> 54:36.605
- Look, I know what this
looks like all right?

54:36.606 --> 54:39.842
But I'm not crazy,
they drugged me.

54:39.843 --> 54:42.278
Everything I'm about to say
is the absolute truth.

54:42.279 --> 54:44.947
There are fucking psychopaths
there and they got

54:44.948 --> 54:47.483
weapons and they're hunting
me down right now.

54:47.484 --> 54:50.319
- This is a small town,
everybody knows everybody.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.788
I can understand if it
seems a little strange.

54:52.789 --> 54:55.557
- I don't care what it
sounds like, all right?

54:55.558 --> 54:58.427
And I don't even think anyone's
from this fuckin' town.

54:58.428 --> 54:59.863
- It's okay, calm down.

55:00.930 --> 55:02.531
Can you describe them to me?
- Yeah.

55:02.532 --> 55:06.802
Yeah, the leader, he's like
a biker with long hair

55:06.803 --> 55:11.875
and he's got a clown mask on
and a baseball bat and...

55:13.043 --> 55:16.046
Fuck, the other guy
is, I don't know,

55:17.080 --> 55:19.482
he's wearing a devil's mask and

55:20.750 --> 55:23.852
they're driving a convertible,
one of those old ones.

55:23.853 --> 55:24.754
Blue I think.

55:24.755 --> 55:29.692
- That's funny, that sounds
exactly like somebody I know,

55:29.693 --> 55:30.894
Mr. Mouse.

55:33.530 --> 55:35.831
- Shit, no, no.

55:35.832 --> 55:36.833
Fuck, fuck!

55:43.106 --> 55:44.907
- Then

55:44.908 --> 55:46.843
it gets in the cage.

55:48.745 --> 55:50.045
- Fuck you.

55:50.046 --> 55:53.483
- It gets in the fucking cage!

55:55.618 --> 55:56.886
Did I stutter?

56:01.057 --> 56:04.027
- You're fuckin' crazy.

56:09.933 --> 56:14.470
- We're taking you for a ride, Mr.
Mouse.

56:14.471 --> 56:16.473
- You're fucking crazy!

56:17.807 --> 56:21.845
- A handsome little
mouse for delivery.

56:32.389 --> 56:35.591
- Are we like the
man in the cage?

56:35.592 --> 56:38.961
- No, we are not like
the man in the cage.

56:38.962 --> 56:42.898
- Are we controlled by
the fates around us?

56:42.899 --> 56:46.869
- No, we are free to
choose our own fate.

56:46.870 --> 56:51.174
- And what fate do we choose
for the man in the cage?

57:14.964 --> 57:19.001
- What the hell is
wrong with you people?

57:19.002 --> 57:23.072
Let me outta here!

57:29.078 --> 57:30.180
Please.

57:31.981 --> 57:34.049
Guys, guys, you don't
have to do this okay?

57:34.050 --> 57:35.951
We can talk about it,
what do you guys want?

57:35.952 --> 57:39.155
I'll do anything
you need me to do.

59:12.282 --> 59:15.184
- Woo, that was rocking!

59:20.089 --> 59:21.857
- Fuck.

59:21.858 --> 59:25.929
- You broke my cage.
- Was all you mother fucker.

59:31.267 --> 59:34.736
- The storm's a-brewing Mr.
Mouse.

59:34.737 --> 59:36.706
That's the spirit, run!

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:30.827
Hello Mr. Mouse.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:37.800
I see you got yourself
into a little maze.

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:42.839
Does it think

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.309
it can find its way out?

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:46.421
- You know, it's only
a matter of time

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:49.424
before you stop playing.

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:52.561
- Fuck.

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.831
- What the fuck?

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:00.937
- I'm done fuckin'
around with this guy.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.139
- Smoke him out.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:53.449
- Fuck.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.116
Fuck.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:57.086
I can't take it.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:00.055
Fuck.

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.358
Get me the fuck outta here!

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.259
- Whoa whoa whoa, whoa.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:41.429
What's the matter, you
don't like the company?

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:42.999
Come on, get out.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:48.704
- Welcome to the hangar.

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:54.209
Ah.

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.178
I love that industrial smell.

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:58.446
It smells like

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:03.618
shit's gettin' dark.

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.688
- Time to get shit done.

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.758
Move.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:13.361
You can move or you can end up

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:16.064
like your trunk
buddy over there.

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.065
Move.

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:15.324
Don't you wanna see

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:17.760
how it ends?

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.220
Move.

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:48.723
Keep moving.

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:49.724
Move.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:53.595
Move.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:59.435
I said...

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.814
- You think I'm fuckin' around?

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:19.321
You think I'm fuckin'
playing, huh?

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:24.759
What the fuck!
- We need to keep him alive

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.831
and conscious, otherwise
all this was for nothing.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.700
Let's just get him to the chair.

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.481
I've

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:21.884
hacked this unit

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.691
to create a feedback
loop between your brain,

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:31.726
the sound

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.564
and the lights.

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:37.800
It causes quite

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:40.001
exquisite

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:42.270
hallucinations.

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.809
But we're gonna give you a
little help with that too.

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:12.800
- The more you panic,

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:15.671
the more you struggle
against your thoughts,

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:20.709
the worse it's gonna get.

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:29.617
- And that's the beauty of it.

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:30.986
You're torturing yourself.

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.031
- Just kill me already.

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:22.970
- More Jesus.

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.040
Can I have just a
little bit more Jesus?

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:28.876
Jesus, can I have a little more?

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:29.945
Please Jesus.

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:33.982
Don't you judge me!

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:56.004
- Fuckin' Mouse.

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:59.475
What it is, Mr. Mouse?

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:25.567
- I'm gonna call
them immediately.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.818
- Every dead thing has thoughts.

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:39.107
- It's the solo

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:42.211
of being between lives.

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:36.958
- Welcome home, step right in.

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:39.661
Hear my breath, feel my skin.

01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:43.665
Welcome home, step inside.

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:47.803
Watch me dance or watch me die.
