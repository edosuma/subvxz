00:06.500 --> 00:08.400
-GenCoin. I'm talking
about a new currency.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.195
-You know how many
broke-ass niggas come knocking

00:10.250 --> 00:11.569
on my damn door
with their hands out?

00:11.660 --> 00:13.196
Just imagine owning a fraction

00:13.250 --> 00:16.287
of every dollar spent
in the United States.

00:16.330 --> 00:18.651
1.5 mil. What about Ronnie?

00:18.700 --> 00:21.498
- Do we still need him?
- We have the seed money,

00:21.500 --> 00:23.786
and he is dangerous.
-All right, one job.

00:23.830 --> 00:25.650
You get your shit back.
I don't chase you anymore.

00:25.750 --> 00:28.492
- How's that?
- I feel like this warrants it.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.741
--Who this?

00:30.790 --> 00:32.405
-I'm leaving.
-No, you're not.

01:11.330 --> 01:15.152
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Wait, wait. No. Come on.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.078
Come on. Don't do that.
Don't do that.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.442
- My head.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.785
- Yeah, I know.
- You took a fall.

01:22.830 --> 01:25.116
Let's get you some ice, okay?
You fell. Hold on.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.570
I need
to go to the doctor.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.157
I know. Maddie? Maddie?

01:29.200 --> 01:31.998
Maddie! Maddie, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.571
You just got to lie still.
Lie still.

01:34.660 --> 01:36.150
I'm gonna get you
some ice for that head.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.997
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back. All right?

01:38.040 --> 01:39.826
I'll be back.
I'll be back, Maddie.

01:39.830 --> 01:41.821
I'll be right back, okay?

01:58.750 --> 02:01.287
Whoa, Nelly! Whoa, Nelly.
Come on. Come on, come on.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.036
Let's-- let's get you
back in there.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.900
-I gotta go to the hospital.
-Maddie. Maddie!

02:04.950 --> 02:06.998
A doctor's coming. Okay?
I'm need--

02:07.040 --> 02:10.032
Maddie? Maddie. Maddie.
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.149
Just lie down.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.649
Okay.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.533
Here's the ice. Come on.
Put this on your...

02:16.580 --> 02:18.696
Maddie? Maddie!
Stop struggling, huh?

02:18.750 --> 02:21.287
Stop struggling, okay? Okay?
You can't--

02:21.330 --> 02:24.288
- I wanna go. Let me--
- Jesus Christ.

02:24.330 --> 02:25.991
Maddie.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.655
-What are you doing?
What are you doing?

02:27.660 --> 02:29.150
-No, no, no, Maddie.
-What are you doing? No!

02:29.250 --> 02:30.569
-Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.
-No!No!

02:30.620 --> 02:32.781
-Maddie?
-No! Phil, what are you doing?

02:32.830 --> 02:35.822
No! No!
-All right, stop. Stop.

02:35.870 --> 02:39.442
-Don't do that again. Okay?
Don't fucking do that again.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.821
--Don't fucking do that again.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.617
Maddie. Come here, please.

02:46.660 --> 02:49.447
Come here. Maddie?
If you don't give me your arm,

02:49.500 --> 02:51.320
you're gonna break
your fucking head open.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.247
Come here. Come on, come on.

02:53.330 --> 02:56.993
Honey? Maddie?
Maddie, look at me.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.577
All right, look at me.
I'm not touching you.

02:59.660 --> 03:03.152
--Maddie? The more you struggle--

03:03.200 --> 03:05.782
the more you struggle,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

03:05.830 --> 03:08.151
Okay? I do not want you
to hurt yourself!

03:08.160 --> 03:10.651
I don't want it, Maddie.
Please, just give me your arm.

03:10.660 --> 03:13.993
Just give me your arm.
I don't want you to get hurt.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.492
-Please. Please, let me go.
I won't say anything.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.036
-Maddie.
-Please let me go. Please!

03:18.080 --> 03:19.616
You don't have to do this.
-Honey.

03:19.660 --> 03:22.288
Sit down. Honey? Sit down.

03:22.330 --> 03:25.151
Honey? Sit down.
-Phil. Phil!

03:25.200 --> 03:28.658
-I am in hell! Stop!

03:34.040 --> 03:36.907
-Phil. Phil. Phil, don't go.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.992
Phil! Phil. Phil.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.321
Phil! Phil!

03:43.330 --> 03:44.319
Phil!

04:10.290 --> 04:15.569
- N0! N0! Ali!

04:15.620 --> 04:19.989
Why? Why?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.867
Why?

04:22.910 --> 04:25.652
No!

04:25.700 --> 04:29.443
Why? No!

04:29.500 --> 04:34.324
Why? Why?

05:01.660 --> 05:04.197
You got that?

05:07.160 --> 05:08.286
What we gonna do?

06:24.330 --> 06:26.821
- Can I just have a quick look?
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

06:26.830 --> 06:29.071
-I just want--
I just want to--
-You--

06:29.160 --> 06:31.867
you know what you're gonna say.
Gimme this. Stop!

06:33.040 --> 06:34.029
-So then...

06:35.700 --> 06:37.327
-You're gonna-- no.
-You're gonna give it to him.

06:37.370 --> 06:38.826
-You're gonna give it to him.
-Okay.

06:38.910 --> 06:40.616
-You're gonna say what
we decided, and that's that.

06:40.660 --> 06:41.991
I'll be there if you need me.
-So-- right.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.399
-Okay?
-I'll do the talking,

06:43.450 --> 06:45.577
and if-- what I'll--
what I'll do is, if I need you,

06:45.620 --> 06:47.747
I'll just look to you.
I'll do a silent--
-Okay.

06:47.790 --> 06:50.156
Okay. You don't need
to look at me. I'll know.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.111
I'll know if you need me.
-Okay.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.822
But probably not.
Probably not gonna need you.

06:54.870 --> 06:56.246
-Can you stop?
-What?

06:56.290 --> 06:58.440
-You're making me nervous.
-Why?

06:58.500 --> 07:00.400
-'Cause you don't stop.
Relax.

07:00.450 --> 07:01.610
He's not gonna do anything here.

07:01.660 --> 07:04.151
-Yeah, not here.
But later--

07:04.200 --> 07:07.829
-Not later. It's business.
He's gonna understand.

07:07.830 --> 07:11.288
-I should--
you know, I feel like, um--

07:11.330 --> 07:13.651
Let me pee first.
-Hurry up.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.405
-So, uh...

08:12.540 --> 08:15.612
we initially brought you in...

08:16.830 --> 08:19.071
as a partner. Um...

08:19.120 --> 08:21.406
which was really good.
It was great.

08:21.450 --> 08:24.749
Um, and then we all agreed
that we would go out

08:24.790 --> 08:27.156
_ and we_would
find more Investors.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.819
And so that's what we did.
We all, uh-- we-we--

08:31.870 --> 08:34.782
-We need to move
on without you, dude.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.191
This is our, um...

08:39.290 --> 08:41.281
This is our offer.
Will you just hand that to him?

08:41.330 --> 08:45.494
This is offer. It's, um-- it's--

08:45.580 --> 08:49.949
officially offer you
two percent in perpetuity--

08:50.000 --> 08:51.615
a passive two percent,
mind you--

08:51.660 --> 08:53.287
as well as the repayment
of your initial 300.

08:53.330 --> 08:55.366
-You literally don't have
to do anything.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.992
I mean, you'll be making money
sitting on your ass.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.031
It's a sweet deal,
if you ask me.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.069
It's very fair.

09:08.370 --> 09:10.156
-Nope.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.992
-So, no?
-I reject your offer.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.321
-Okay.
-Yeah. No.

09:20.370 --> 09:23.862
That's, uh--
that's not an option.

09:26.660 --> 09:29.823
-Why not?
-'Cause we voted. Two to one.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.319
-Okay. Okay.

09:33.500 --> 09:38.119
You voted. Two to one.
-Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.788
-That's-- that's right.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.192
-Or-- or, may I just add,
forget it.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.696
Because the other thing is
I can see a version

09:50.750 --> 09:52.866
where three partners
is pretty great, actually.

09:52.910 --> 09:55.652
So I think let's forget it.
Let's just order breakfast.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.941
It's fine.
-No. No, that's not up

09:58.000 --> 09:59.536
for discussion.
-Why not?

09:59.620 --> 10:01.827
-It's up for discussion.
-Ronnie, I'm sorry,

10:01.830 --> 10:04.037
but we made a decision.
-Why?

10:04.120 --> 10:06.406
- Why what?
- Did I stutter?

10:09.500 --> 10:10.990
-No. No, you didn't stutter.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.490
-Why'd you make the decision?

10:14.500 --> 10:15.865
-Well--
-Because we landed

10:15.910 --> 10:18.367
Benedict Blush for 1.5.
Nick did it.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.446
Basically, we're legit now.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.649
-Big Nick.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.571
Your nuts finally dropped.
My nigga.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.611
This is good, this is good.
We back in business now.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.616
Shit's lookin' up.
-There is no we.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.691
-And why not, Isabelle?
Please.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.032
Please explain that shit to me.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.401
'Cause my dumb Haitian ass
probably just misunderstanding

10:39.500 --> 10:41.536
what you college-educated
white folks is talking about,

10:41.620 --> 10:43.281
- is that right?
- No, it's not like that.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.116
- Then what's it like then?
- It has nothing to do

10:45.160 --> 10:46.991
with where you're from.
It doesn't have anything to do

10:47.040 --> 10:48.655
with where we're from either.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.820
- You scare people.
- The thing-- no.

10:50.830 --> 10:52.991
Let's be, you know,
constructive. It's not--

10:53.080 --> 10:56.117
You do, but the point is
you're in a gang.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.321
And that's a very dangerous
element for us.

10:58.370 --> 11:00.577
-I'm here right now,
because I was doin' business

11:00.620 --> 11:03.828
with your bitch-ass daddy,
South Beach.

11:03.870 --> 11:08.648
I'm sittin' right here,
right now, because of that.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.361
Ain't that some shit?

11:10.410 --> 11:12.287
You wanna _now what
the only difference

11:12.330 --> 11:15.652
between a rich thug
and a poor thug is?

11:20.870 --> 11:24.442
You're here 'cause your daddy
brought into this.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.650
-That's what I'm trying
to correct.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.157
-Now you wanna start
with this shit right here?

11:30.250 --> 11:33.401
You don't think a Haitian know
how to pull down 1.5 million?

11:33.450 --> 11:35.998
That's what's up? All right.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.650
Grab on to your dicks.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.906
Just one second.
I'll show you what's up.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.327
-Think he's coming back?
Let's get the check.

11:48.370 --> 11:50.190
-Can we have the check?
-Can we have the check, please?

11:56.910 --> 11:58.571
Phil, look at me.

11:59.910 --> 12:00.899
Please.

12:02.370 --> 12:04.497
Please let me go.

12:04.540 --> 12:07.498
Look at me.
Look at me!

12:08.660 --> 12:09.820
Please.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.786
Phil, look at me.

12:22.620 --> 12:24.190
Please look at me.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.907
- Ah.

12:28.950 --> 12:31.657
- It's not too late.
- It's not too late.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.032
Please. Please let me go.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.360
Please.

12:39.580 --> 12:40.695
Phil.

13:16.250 --> 13:19.822
-Mr. Rask.
-Is it working?

13:19.870 --> 13:23.692
-Not 2.2 here.
Only 1.8.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.241
-Whoa. What do you mean?

13:26.330 --> 13:30.289
-Only 1.8, but my fee
still ten percent of 2.2.

13:32.160 --> 13:35.652
-That's not our deal, man.
No, wait. Wait.

13:38.410 --> 13:39.741
Sit down, please.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.439
Deal.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.359
-You kill the girl yet?

14:00.040 --> 14:00.995
-What?

14:03.910 --> 14:05.571
-You kill the girl yet?

14:07.410 --> 14:08.991
-You ever ask me that again,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.286
I'm gonna put a bullet
through your head.

14:11.330 --> 14:13.150
I don't want you
asking me that again.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.740
-She saw me.
-Yeah.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.076
-She see this, she see you.
-Yeah. I know.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.576
I know, you're a genius.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.440
You let me deal with that.
All right?

14:23.500 --> 14:25.695
You deal with getting me
my fucking money.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.570
-Ten percent of 2.2.
-I know!

14:32.620 --> 14:35.783
I get the fucking deal!
I understand!

14:43.160 --> 14:44.149
Sure.

14:55.830 --> 14:57.115
-I think that went well.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.785
-Okay.

15:01.830 --> 15:04.151
--Hard life.

15:06.660 --> 15:08.070
-Hey, watch the road.

15:09.830 --> 15:11.650
Come on, the road. Please.

15:13.540 --> 15:14.905
I hope it's worth killing us.

15:14.950 --> 15:17.111
-Someone's hacking my shit!

15:17.160 --> 15:18.946
They're taking all our money.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.490
-Our money?
-Yes, our money!

15:20.540 --> 15:22.189
-Right now?
-Yes, right now!

15:22.250 --> 15:24.821
-Stop it! Here, I'll steer!
Just--

15:24.870 --> 15:25.859
-I need to go home.
-Okay.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.570
-Get out of the fast lane!

15:38.200 --> 15:40.282
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no! Is that us?

15:40.330 --> 15:41.399
-Someone slaved my whole system.

15:41.450 --> 15:42.906
-You said this couldn't happen!

15:42.950 --> 15:44.497
Who's doing this?!
-I don't know, Nick!

15:44.500 --> 15:45.990
But I need to cut them off!
-Jesus!

15:46.080 --> 15:47.650
Can we just unplug it?
Can we start--
-No,no!

15:47.660 --> 15:48.786
That'll lock me out completely.

15:48.830 --> 15:50.240
-Oh, my God!

15:50.290 --> 15:51.860
-How'd they change
my encryption key?

15:51.910 --> 15:53.446
How'd they change my key?
-What does that mean?

15:53.500 --> 15:54.569
What do we do?
-Nick, I need you

15:54.620 --> 15:56.030
to shut up for one minute...
-All right.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.490
-...so I can stop the bleeding.
-I'm sorry.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.492
- Oh, my God, look at it.
- Look at it. Look at it.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.827
-Oh, my God! Look at it!

16:38.000 --> 16:39.570
-It's bots.
-What? What are bots?

16:39.620 --> 16:41.440
-It's bots. They're using bots.
That's how they got in.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.899
Slaving other computers
and using them

16:42.950 --> 16:44.531
to attack this one.
-Like these computers?

16:44.580 --> 16:45.865
Are they using these?
-No! It has to be

16:45.910 --> 16:47.320
from a different router.

16:47.370 --> 16:49.076
It literally could be
anywhere in the world, but--

16:49.160 --> 16:50.991
-Make it stop. Look, look!

16:51.000 --> 16:52.740
-Stop! Stop, Nick, I'm trying!

16:52.830 --> 16:54.320
-Jesus Christ.
-They changed my encryption key.

16:54.370 --> 16:55.689
That means they
have to do it locally.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.439
That's the only way.
-Okay.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.649
-Means they're on my wi-fi.

16:58.660 --> 17:00.366
-Can we unplug the wi-fi?

17:00.450 --> 17:02.782
-No, that'll lock me out
for good, I just told you that!

17:18.620 --> 17:20.156
Go to the neighbors.
-Okay.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.781
-Go to the neighbors--
three houses

17:21.830 --> 17:23.195
in every direction.
-What do I do?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.569
-Tell them to
turn their powers off.

17:24.620 --> 17:26.190
Turn their computers off.
Turn everything.
-What?

17:26.250 --> 17:27.649
-Yes! _
-They're not gonna listen to me.

17:27.700 --> 17:28.826
-Make it up, Nick, I don't know!

17:28.830 --> 17:29.990
-What do I say?
-Make it up!

17:30.000 --> 17:31.365
-What do I say?
-Something! Jesus!

17:31.410 --> 17:33.321
-I don't know! Go!
-Do that!

17:50.500 --> 17:52.991
-Where Lance at?
-Excuse me. Sir?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.651
Sorry to scare you.
Is this your house?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.907
You-- is there
any way we could--

17:57.950 --> 18:00.282
There's a medical emergency
happening down the street.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.111
-Suck my dick and choke on it!

18:26.200 --> 18:27.997
-Nick, come on.
Move quicker.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.491
-Hi. Sir, uh,
I have a huge emergency.

18:30.580 --> 18:31.786
I'm sorry--
sorry to bother you.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.532
Can I give you ten dollars
and I can unplug your computer

18:38.580 --> 18:40.571
and your router
for no more than ten minutes?

18:42.120 --> 18:45.248
-No, no, no, no, no.
No, no. No.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.281
No! God!

18:52.200 --> 18:54.532
-Hi. Sorry, I don't
mean to scare you.

18:57.580 --> 19:00.993
Um, do you have computador?
It's, um, emergency.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.824
Emergency. It's...

19:09.290 --> 19:11.656
-No. No, no!
No, no, no, no!

19:11.660 --> 19:15.073
No, no, no! No! Oh!

19:27.160 --> 19:29.902
- ...unplugging...

19:37.500 --> 19:41.038
-Yes, Nick! Yes!

19:50.790 --> 19:52.746
-That's driving me nuts. Okay?

19:52.790 --> 19:54.746
I can't hear myself think
out there.

19:55.750 --> 19:56.785
I need to think.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.491
-Come on. Come--

20:17.540 --> 20:19.997
come on, baby.
Come on, baby! Ha!

20:20.040 --> 20:22.998
-I'm telling you,
these greens are rigged, dawg.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.618
I was hitting it
from far away there, my man.

20:44.750 --> 20:47.651
-Yes, Nick. Yes, yes!

20:52.500 --> 20:54.195
-Chat for a sec?

20:56.250 --> 20:57.649
-I'm in the middle
of a game here, Ronnie.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.150
-I see that, bruh.

21:04.660 --> 21:06.696

21:09.700 --> 21:11.531

without paying taxes.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.446
That shit goes through me, dog.
-Step off, Ronnie.

Okay. Okay.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.287
-I tried coming at you
with some legit shit.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.696

21:30.750 --> 21:33.071

21:33.120 --> 21:35.361

21:35.410 --> 21:38.447
-No, no, no.
You laughed in my face.

So where my money at, dawg?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.287

Just let me go.

24:34.370 --> 24:36.497
What? What?

24:36.500 --> 24:37.944

Laptop.

Your fee-- when I get--
-Already took...

25:42.080 --> 25:43.945

25:46.370 --> 25:48.656
-Well, I think we're done here.
You can go.

25:52.830 --> 25:55.037
I told you,
I was gonna take care of that.

25:57.370 --> 25:58.689
This is your mess.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.156
You did that in there.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.866
And I'm gonna
clean it up for you.

26:04.950 --> 26:07.111
So, you're welcome.
Be on your way.

I'll kill you.

26:45.370 --> 26:48.157
Yeah. I swear to Christ,
I'll kill you.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.149
Turn around.

Come on. Turn.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.280

27:00.160 --> 27:01.946
-You'll be dead, my friend.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.400
I'll go to jail.
Put that down.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.865
-Not smart.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.036
-Get over there. Walk.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.149
Walk.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.617
Get your shit.
Get your shit and get out.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.787
Nice and easy.

She must what?

27:47.120 --> 27:50.112

Does that make you feel tough?

27:50.160 --> 27:53.652
Hm? You with a knife?
Do you feel tough now?

27:53.700 --> 27:55.691

27:55.750 --> 27:57.650
-No.
-No, you don't.
Here's what's gonna happen.

27:57.660 --> 27:59.491
You're gonna walk away,
and if you look at me,

27:59.540 --> 28:00.996
I'm gonna put a bullet
through your head.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.615
Do you understand me?
-Mm-hmm.

28:02.660 --> 28:03.649

29:42.370 --> 29:44.110
Pissing off big Ronnie and all.

29:48.450 --> 29:50.281

-Yeah, we can.
Yeah, we can.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.077

32:52.500 --> 32:53.819
We can get it back.

33:06.660 --> 33:08.651
Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

33:12.910 --> 33:16.949
Well, I mean,
you can find out, right?

33:17.000 --> 33:18.820
I mean,

33:18.870 --> 33:21.657
-Nick, whoever did this
is smarter than me.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.611
They're better than me.
They beat me.

33:23.660 --> 33:26.618
How could I possibly find them?
-Because you're you.

33:29.580 --> 33:32.538
They beat you now.
That's okay.

33:32.580 --> 33:34.866
There's gotta be a way.
You can try, right?

33:34.910 --> 33:39.654
-Nick, I'm tired.
-It's okay. You can try, right?

33:39.700 --> 33:42.658
-I am tired.
-Look at me.

33:42.700 --> 33:45.077
I believe in you.
I believe in you.

33:45.120 --> 33:48.658
Are you saying it's impossible
or you don't know how?

33:48.750 --> 33:50.320
Is it impossible
or you don't know how?

33:50.330 --> 33:52.400
-I don't know how.
-That's okay. That's fine.

33:52.450 --> 33:54.611
That's good. 'Cause then
you'll find a way.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.696

in any way I can.

33:58.660 --> 33:59.786

Where do we start?

34:16.580 --> 34:18.195
-Get me a beer.
-Okay.

34:20.660 --> 34:21.695
Okay.

34:39.290 --> 34:42.282
-Dad!
-Hey! How you doing, baby girl?

34:42.330 --> 34:44.400
-Fine.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.657
-Cartoons.
-Can I watch with you?

34:46.700 --> 34:48.941
-Yeah!
-All right.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.490
-Okay.

34:58.370 --> 35:01.328
Oh, my God. You saw that?

35:01.370 --> 35:03.611
Yeah, that was like--
oh my God.

35:05.330 --> 35:08.948
Oh my God.
This is just hilarious.

36:34.790 --> 36:36.326
-Here. Drink this.

36:38.250 --> 36:39.319
Come on.

36:58.330 --> 37:00.036
- I need a doctor.

37:02.870 --> 37:04.531
Phil.
-Yeah, I know.

37:07.870 --> 37:10.156
-I'm not gonna say anything.
-I know.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.115
-Daewon did this.

37:17.910 --> 37:20.652
I'll tell them it was Daewon
and that he got away.

37:20.750 --> 37:21.739
-Yeah.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.781
-I'll go with you.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.116
I'll go with you,
wherever you're going.

37:34.540 --> 37:36.405
Wherever you're going
with that money.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.407
I want to be with you.
-Maddie.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.195
-That's all that matters.
-Maddie.

37:42.250 --> 37:43.990
-Nothing else matters.
-We can't.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.867
-We can. We can forget
this ever happened.

37:48.950 --> 37:50.998
-Stop.
-It's not too late, Phil.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.446
-Please.
-It's not too late.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.991
--We can take the money.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.151
We'll go wherever you want.
We'll find a beach somewhere.

37:59.160 --> 38:02.652
I'll make you coffee.
We'll lie in bed together.

38:02.750 --> 38:05.287
-Stop! All right? Stop!

38:06.330 --> 38:07.945
Jesus Christ!

38:16.080 --> 38:18.401
-Phil.
-Just give me a second. Please.

38:20.660 --> 38:23.072
-Phil.
-Please, be quiet.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.037
-Phil!_
-Keep your v0ice down.

38:30.450 --> 38:32.532
-Phil!_
-Keep your v0ice down.

38:32.620 --> 38:35.862
-Phil Rask! Phil Rask!

38:35.950 --> 38:39.249
Help! Help! Help!

38:39.290 --> 38:43.329
- Maddie. Maddie.
Shut your mouth.

38:43.330 --> 38:47.539
-I can't take my hand off
if you're screaming.

38:47.580 --> 38:49.571
I can't take my hand off
if you're screaming.

38:49.620 --> 38:53.363
You stop screaming,
and this stops. Come on.

38:53.410 --> 38:55.947
--Maddie.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.195
Maddie!

39:01.660 --> 39:03.571
- Shut up.

39:03.660 --> 39:04.820
Shut up.

39:09.330 --> 39:11.286
Is that what you want?

39:11.330 --> 39:12.649
Is this what you want?

39:16.160 --> 39:18.446
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

39:18.500 --> 39:21.151
Shut up. Shut up.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.400
Shut up.

39:24.290 --> 39:26.611
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.241
-Jesus Christ.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.570
--I'm sorry.

39:33.620 --> 39:36.191
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:36.250 --> 39:40.402
Maddie. Shh, shh, shh.

39:41.750 --> 39:44.071
-All right. One sec.

40:42.790 --> 40:43.825
-Hey.

40:50.870 --> 40:52.155
I'm sorry.

40:57.540 --> 40:58.609
I'm sorry.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.149
That wasn't me.

41:10.500 --> 41:11.899
That was someone else.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.821
That was-- No!

41:15.950 --> 41:19.283
N0! N
-Ah!0!

41:19.330 --> 41:21.616
- Maddie!

41:21.660 --> 41:25.448
-Put it down. Put it down!
Put it down!

41:28.000 --> 41:30.150
No!

41:30.160 --> 41:33.323
- Give me that.
Give me that.

41:33.370 --> 41:36.112
-What the f--
gimme that!

41:44.000 --> 41:46.036
- Wait!

41:53.080 --> 41:55.867
--Maddie.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.149
Maddie?

42:01.500 --> 42:02.489
Maddie.

42:22.620 --> 42:26.499
- You may not hear me

42:26.540 --> 42:30.499
But I'm still here

42:30.540 --> 42:34.499
You may not feel me

42:34.540 --> 42:38.533
But I'm still here

42:38.620 --> 42:42.784
I'm still here

42:42.830 --> 42:47.995
I'm
still here

42:54.580 --> 42:58.619
- Don't believe a word I say

42:58.660 --> 43:02.198
It isn't true

43:02.250 --> 43:05.822
- And please forgive
the things

43:05.870 --> 43:10.079
That I may say or do

43:10.120 --> 43:14.363
- 'Cause I can make you safe
- And I can make you whole

43:14.410 --> 43:18.403
- But pride is deep and dark,
and it weighs heavy on my soul

43:18.500 --> 43:22.288
- And all the wrong words
shatter on the floor

43:22.330 --> 43:26.448
Shatter on the floor

43:26.500 --> 43:30.493
- You may not hear me

43:30.580 --> 43:34.493
But I'm still here

43:34.500 --> 43:38.573
You may not feel me

43:38.620 --> 43:42.533
But I'm still here

43:42.580 --> 43:46.619
You may not heal me

43:46.660 --> 43:50.653
But I'm still here
