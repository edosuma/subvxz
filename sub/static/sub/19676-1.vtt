Well, that's a use of tax dollars
I can get behind.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.273
Now, get this assclown out of here.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.437
All right. Come with me. Come on.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.750
You want these murders to stop,
you best listen.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.877
You have some information
on these murders?

18:15.040 --> 18:16.838
Yep. Get him away from me.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.753
I prefer to have you in cuffs, but okay.
Let him go.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.554
Make it quick, Mr. Woodley.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.836
Let me start by saying you're not gonna
believe one damn thing I'm about to say.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.439
But that don't make it a lie.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.270
Why don't you start with who you are
and what you know?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.435
I'm a hunter.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.999
Demon hunter.

Demon hunter.

For a second, I thought
you weren't wasting our time.

18:57.560 --> 19:01.440
- Get this guy out of here, put him in cuffs.
- I've done this 100 times, honey.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.671
- Come on, demon hunter.
- Get him out of here.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.513
OTIS: That's enough, Mr. Woodley.
- I tell people what I do...

19:05.680 --> 19:09.116
...they just sit there, looking dumbstruck
or roll around and laugh.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.272
Then they gotta see something with
their own eyes that proves it.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.159
Maybe they see me pull
one of these things out of their son...

19:15.320 --> 19:19.200
...his body twitching and flapping in ways
the human body ought not to do.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.115
Or they see their momma looking back at
them with those dead, black eyes.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.351
Or sometimes,
they never do come around.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.710
That is,
until they get possessed themselves...

19:27.880 --> 19:29.917
...and feel indescribable pain and fear...

19:30.080 --> 19:33.550
...that comes with losing control
of your body as your conscious self...

19:33.720 --> 19:38.032
...your soul burns and evaporates
into the abyss, like you never was.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.991
Now, every once in a while, I'll meet
someone, or maybe a pair of folks...

19:42.200 --> 19:45.477
...that aren't so thickheaded as to think
that it's pure coincidence...

19:45.640 --> 19:48.758
...that I end up here
in the middle of fucking nowhere...

19:48.920 --> 19:53.232
...and without asking, know exactly
the patterns of the murders in question.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.550
And when those people
put their trust in me...

19:55.720 --> 19:58.109
...and just let their doubts aside, then...

19:58.280 --> 20:00.715
...lives are saved,
lives that would've been lost...

20:00.880 --> 20:04.430
...and I just get tossed out of here
and have to do all this shit on my own.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.280
But, you know, sometimes,
the lives saved are their own.

20:07.560 --> 20:11.394
Now, having heard that,
are you gonna hear me out?

20:12.120 --> 20:13.349
Are you?

20:13.760 --> 20:15.398
Are you gonna hear me out?

20:18.200 --> 20:20.430

- Yeah.

- Doesn't make any sense.
- Well...

Is it all right if I come in
and have a word with you?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.437
I'm really sorry to disturb you.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.389
I know you're going through
a terrible ordeal.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.551
I just need to ask you a few questions.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.278
They always used to fight.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.031
Who? Who used to fight?

22:55.120 --> 22:57.555
Benjamin and Bethany.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.071
So rambunctious.

23:00.240 --> 23:04.757
They could ruin an entire house
if you didn't keep an eye on them.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.073
Those-- Were those your kids?

23:07.280 --> 23:09.874
I used to scream at them.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.990
I'd get so angry.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.397
But I didn't want them
hurting each other.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.200
I didn't want them growing up so...

23:19.960 --> 23:21.837
...violently.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.589
But they were just playing.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.069
That was not violence.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.559
I never knew what violence was.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.960
Mrs. Macullum, I just need you
to tell me what happened--

23:38.120 --> 23:40.794
I think about all the times
I sent them to their room.

23:40.960 --> 23:44.078
All the times
I didn't speak to them, the time...

23:46.800 --> 23:50.714
The time I lost with them
that I'll never have back.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.640
Daniel always let them fight.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.278
They were fighting that night
when Marcus came in.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.518
But Daniel, he was quick to draw.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.232
He was a marine, on leave from Iraq.

So strong.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.240
That's why I married him.

24:34.400 --> 24:38.314
I wanted my children to come
from a strong man like Daniel.

24:39.480 --> 24:43.439
And he told me to hide in the closet,
and he shot that bastard Marcus.

24:46.000 --> 24:46.990

...because I been chasing him
for half my damn life now.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.118
How do you know that this demon
is the one you seek?

27:35.280 --> 27:38.830
Its means of transfiguration.
The way it changes form.

27:39.000 --> 27:39.990
It's unique.

27:41.120 --> 27:44.351
I'm not gonna sit and talk about
the history of these pieces of shit.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.955
I don't know if there's God or hell,
but these exist.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.795
I know because I've killed them.
I know because they killed friends of mine.

...and you might just survive.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.994
You said this one is unique. How?

28:05.680 --> 28:09.310
Every demon's different, but they all have
their own means of transfiguration.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.551
<i>Some only stay in you
for a couple seconds...</i>

28:12.520 --> 28:14.591
<i>...you know,
like you didn't even know it.</i>

28:15.760 --> 28:19.276
Others will take you over
for their entire lives.

28:19.440 --> 28:23.320
And you have to pry them loose,
which is often easier said than done.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.519
With some of them,
just gotta touch you.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.710
Others will only pass
through sexual exchanges.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.439
Some of these things will just leave you,
stick to a doorway...

28:39.600 --> 28:41.159
...like an invisible spider web...

28:41.360 --> 28:43.670
...just waiting for the next fella
to walk past.

28:44.440 --> 28:47.478
Most of them like to move.
I like the ones that stay in one place.

28:47.640 --> 28:51.110
But they all have one thing in common:
they exist to destroy.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.719
<i>There's just something about us,
about our world, that they wanna end.</i>

28:57.200 --> 29:00.591
So, what about this one?
How does this one work?

29:01.120 --> 29:04.158
Many years ago, my old man and I,
we came across a small town...

29:04.520 --> 29:06.318
...not unlike this one y'all got here.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.517
<i>Thing had been there
for a couple of days.</i>

29:08.720 --> 29:10.711
<i>Nearly the whole town
had gotten killed.</i>

29:10.880 --> 29:14.077
<i>It was unusual because demons
normally aren't responsible...</i>

29:14.240 --> 29:17.596
...for those body counts.
They're more partial to personal torment.

29:18.440 --> 29:22.354
But this thing was different. See, the way
it transfigured was by being killed.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.352
The moment you killed it,
it became you.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.309
Which, needless to say,
complicated things.

29:29.480 --> 29:31.232
<i>So anyway, me and my dad sat there...</i>

29:31.400 --> 29:35.359
<i>...and explained this to the townfoiks,
just like I'm explaining it to you now.</i>

29:35.680 --> 29:39.389
<i>Course, they believed us straight on,
having seen the carnage themselves.</i>

29:39.600 --> 29:41.432
Okay. So how'd you kill it?

29:41.600 --> 29:43.750
<i>JEBEUAH:
See, my old man had the brave idea.</i>

29:43.920 --> 29:45.718
<i>He sacrificed himself.</i>

29:45.880 --> 29:49.111
<i>He drank a poison,
and then he killed it.</i>

29:50.040 --> 29:52.634
<i>So the demon had no place to go.</i>

29:53.080 --> 29:54.912
<i>And I could trap it.</i>

29:58.040 --> 30:00.634
Well, I'm so sorry.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.316
- I lost my daddy to prostate cancer.
- That's a shame.

30:04.480 --> 30:08.553
- So how did you lose the demon?
- I'm getting to it. It's complicated.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.870
I tried to hang onto it for 3O years.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.759
It just had a funny way
of slipping out of my hands.

30:13.920 --> 30:17.436
You see, the thing has a life of its own.
It doesn't wanna stay in that box.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.910
It's got a way of influencing
the world around it.

30:20.200 --> 30:23.352
- Okay. How did you lose it, Mr. Woodley?
- You can't kill the thing.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.353
All you can do is put it
where no one will ever get to it.

30:26.640 --> 30:30.031
So I rented a plane, came down here.
Was gonna drop it here in the bayou.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.998
Engine trouble...

30:32.160 --> 30:34.231
...fire starts, I gotta bail out.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.357
Plane just scatters itself
all around town.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.915
I remember investigating that crash.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.150
Good for you.

30:40.320 --> 30:44.871
Anyhow, middle of the bayou
ain't a bad place to hide the thing.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.999
So I just stuck around town for a while,
just in case somebody stumbled upon it.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.589
Which is good,
because that's what happened.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.350
[CHUCKLES]

30:57.560 --> 31:00.234
Well, some nice trees they have here.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.149

forgotten my wallet. Heh, heh.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.070
Fine.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.118
This one's on me.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.595
Thank you very much.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.238
So let's just say
any part of that is true.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.913
YOU got a plan?

31:19.080 --> 31:22.471
I suggest you find the man that
killed the last of those three murderers.

31:22.640 --> 31:26.031
Hold a town meeting with everyone
except him, tell them what happened...

31:26.200 --> 31:28.157
...and maybe
we can work together on this.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.839
You wanna tell an entire town...

31:30.000 --> 31:32.071
...there's a body-hopping demon
on the loose?

31:32.280 --> 31:35.113
- Something like that.
- That's only going to exacerbate things.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.510
Even if they believe you,
which I highly doubt...

31:37.680 --> 31:40.877
...this town is ultra-Christian.
They're gonna go into a panic.

31:41.520 --> 31:44.592
Chief Dunham, is there an emergency
system at the local school...

31:44.760 --> 31:46.433
...so we can keep the children safe?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.796
Agent Pierce, you're gonna
have to pardon me...

31:48.960 --> 31:51.793
...but I think you spent
a little too much time in Washington.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.951
This here's Chicory Creek, Mississippi.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.873
We just got our first stoplight
about six months ago. Heh, heh.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.836
I'm sorry, but this plan is ridiculous.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.470
I'm not gonna let you get this town
