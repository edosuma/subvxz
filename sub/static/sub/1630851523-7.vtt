00:06.072 --> 00:09.175
This is a stickup.
Everybody down on the ground.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.311
Just stay on the floor,
and nobody gets hurt.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.346
Hurry up before
the pigs get here.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.346
Be cool.

00:13.413 --> 00:14.614
Why are you doing this?

00:14.681 --> 00:16.649
Because banks are a bummer, man.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.585
This mask is so hot.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.620
Ah, it's like my hair
was sweating.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.756
Flower, put your
mask back on.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.290
Don't use my real name.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.426
That's not your real name.

00:26.493 --> 00:28.595
(siren approaching)

00:26.493 --> 00:28.595
Oh, right, it's Susan.

00:28.661 --> 00:30.196
Let's get out
of here.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.565
G-Go, go, go!

00:32.632 --> 00:34.467
Bye.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.569
♪ ♪

00:39.539 --> 00:41.341
(door closes)

00:39.539 --> 00:41.341
JAY: Babe?

00:41.408 --> 00:42.675
Sam?

00:42.742 --> 00:45.645
Hey. I got you your favorite.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.415
Oh, Daisy's Coffee Shop.
I love this place. Thanks, babe.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.383
That is an americano
for my booboo,

00:50.450 --> 00:53.420
and a perfectly normal adult
caffeinated beverage for me.

00:53.486 --> 00:56.156
This is not a man who's destined
to keep it tight, Sam.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.357
What are you working on?

00:57.424 --> 00:59.559
Well, I'm trying to come up with
article ideas for my meeting

00:59.626 --> 01:01.261
at The Ulster County Review
tomorrow.

01:01.327 --> 01:03.163
The New Yorker
of the Hudson Valley?

01:03.229 --> 01:05.064
That's a big opportunity.

01:05.131 --> 01:06.666
Yeah, this is the kind
of serious journalism

01:06.733 --> 01:07.767
I've always
wanted to do,

01:07.834 --> 01:10.737
and if it goes well, it could
turn into a regular gig.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.172
You're gonna kill it, babe.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.706
All right,
I'll leave you to it.

01:13.773 --> 01:17.143
Mmm. Yum.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.511
Mmm. Mm.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.747
I can't watch a man
do this to himself.

01:20.814 --> 01:21.848
I'm okay with it.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.817
JAY: Love you, babe.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.817
Ooh, wait.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.819
I've got an article
idea for you.

01:25.885 --> 01:28.455
What about a profile
of a local celebrity?

01:28.521 --> 01:29.622
Ooh, like who?

01:29.689 --> 01:31.090
I'm right here.

01:31.157 --> 01:32.792
You said you wanted
a good story,

01:32.859 --> 01:34.194
I'm a good story.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.695
FLOWER: Oh,
I got a story.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.564
Did I ever tell you guys
about the time I robbed a bank?

01:37.630 --> 01:40.633
Only once a week
for the last 50 years.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.135
Wait, you robbed
a bank?

01:42.202 --> 01:44.471
Flower's hippie cult
knocked off a bank,

01:44.537 --> 01:46.139
then gave the money
to poor people.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.740
This was the commune,
not the cult.

01:47.807 --> 01:50.243
They're very similar, but the
commune let you wear your shoes

01:50.310 --> 01:51.644
and you could still talk
to your family.

01:51.711 --> 01:54.147
A Robin Hood hippie
bank robbery? That's amazing.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.782
This should be
the article I write.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.584
Article? What's
she talking about?

01:57.650 --> 01:59.118
SAMANTHA: Oh, it's for
a local magazine.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.820
This is exactly the kind
of thing they'd love.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.388
Quirky,
human interest.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.424
Well you-you can't write
about it. I'm sorry.

02:04.491 --> 02:05.091
SAMANTHA:
What?

02:05.158 --> 02:06.659
Flower, this
would be, like,

02:06.726 --> 02:08.495
the biggest assignment
I've ever landed.

02:08.561 --> 02:09.729
They made me take
an eternal blood oath

02:09.796 --> 02:10.763
to never talk about it.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.365
Oh, totally not a cult.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.467
Flower, you told us
about it a million times.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.836
Well, that's different than
publishing it in a magazine.

02:16.903 --> 02:17.837
But, Flower, it would just be...

02:17.904 --> 02:19.172
I said no!

02:21.541 --> 02:24.377
So... (chuckles) I guess
we're back to Alberta.

02:24.444 --> 02:25.812
(gasps) Hold up.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.414
"Back to Alberta."

02:28.481 --> 02:29.582
(laughs)

02:29.649 --> 02:31.885
I think we just found our title.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.458
So, what do we think?

02:38.525 --> 02:40.827
I'm gonna say just moved
from the city, Ivy League.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.795
Close. Northwestern.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.264
You can see us?

02:44.330 --> 02:45.498
It's kind of a long story.

02:45.565 --> 02:46.866
I had this
near-death experience,

02:46.933 --> 02:48.601
and now I see ghosts.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.737
I guess that's not such
a long story. (chuckles)

02:50.803 --> 02:53.606
Name's Winky. Age 12
when I kicked the bucket.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.676
Headline? I got trampled
by a horse.

02:56.743 --> 03:00.547
I'm Shiki. I'm Lenape, and
I've been here since the 1500s.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.382
Lenape?

03:02.448 --> 03:03.750
I actually
know a...

03:03.816 --> 03:04.918
Who are you
talking to?

03:04.984 --> 03:06.486
I...

03:06.553 --> 03:08.354
I-I was, uh, just practicing
for our meeting.

03:08.421 --> 03:12.191
I was saying I actually know
some stories to pitch you.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.627
Let me just, uh,
check these out. Okay.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.429
Oh. Oh, okay,
that... works.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.198
Okay. Oof, no. No.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.468
Did that. That's too obvious.
What's this in the margin here?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.270
Gummy bears?
Was there a listeria outbreak

03:24.337 --> 03:25.305
in the plant or something?

03:25.371 --> 03:26.506
No, my husband wrote that.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.374
He wanted me to pick up
gummy bears while I was in town

03:28.441 --> 03:31.344
because we ran out,
and he likes gummy bears.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.447
Look, there's some
good ideas in there,

03:34.514 --> 03:36.849
but if I'm gonna hire
a freelancer,

03:36.916 --> 03:38.251
I really need to be wowed,

03:38.318 --> 03:39.986
so unless you
can do that,

03:40.053 --> 03:41.754
I'm gonna have to say,
"Nice to meet you,

03:41.821 --> 03:44.624
and I'm sorry."

03:46.059 --> 03:48.328
Wait, what if I told you
that I had a lead on a story

03:48.394 --> 03:49.862
about a group of hippies
who held up

03:49.929 --> 03:51.264
Hudson Valley
Citizens Bank

03:51.331 --> 03:52.565
in the 1960s
and were never caught?

03:52.632 --> 03:54.334
I'm interested.
Who's your source?

03:54.400 --> 03:55.401
Can you bring them in?

03:54.400 --> 03:55.401
No.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.437
Uh, only I can see them.

03:57.503 --> 03:58.805
Give me 6,000 words by Tuesday.

03:58.871 --> 04:01.941
(snaps fingers)

03:58.871 --> 04:01.941
Sold. A hippie bank robbery?

04:02.008 --> 04:03.610
You should've led
with that one, kid.

04:10.850 --> 04:11.985
Hey, babe.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.753
So, how'd it go?

04:13.820 --> 04:16.656
Well, he bought one of my ideas.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.656
That's great.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.925
We're gonna celebrate tonight
with gummy bears,

04:18.992 --> 04:21.728
which you left in the car,
he said hopefully?

04:21.794 --> 04:22.762
ALBERTA:
So...

04:22.829 --> 04:24.464
which article
did he buy?

04:24.530 --> 04:25.765
Look, you can't tell Flower.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.266
I literally can't see Flower.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.968
Oh, I was talking
to Alberta and Isaac.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.370
They were already
in here with you.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.671
That's not
creepy at all.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.039
I panicked,
and I pitched the story

04:33.106 --> 04:34.841
about Flower's commune
robbing the bank.

04:34.907 --> 04:36.275
The editor
flipped for it.

04:36.342 --> 04:37.310
That's great.

04:36.342 --> 04:37.310
Yes!

04:36.342 --> 04:37.310
Bravo!

04:37.377 --> 04:38.745
No, it's terrible.

04:38.811 --> 04:40.847
Flower explicitly told me
not to write about it.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.515
Okay, well,
she's not gonna know.

04:42.582 --> 04:44.050
Come on, babe,
this is your dream gig.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.419
I know, and now that
they bought it,

04:46.486 --> 04:48.054
it's not like I can
go back there saying,

04:48.121 --> 04:50.356
"Whoop, never mind." They'll
never want to work with me.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.792
Plus, this whole thing
makes no sense.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.727
For years, she's
bragged about it.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.863
Now, suddenly, she doesn't want
the whole world to know.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.898
Mm. That girl
is hiding something,

04:58.965 --> 05:01.334
and if she's hiding something,
it's probably juicy,

05:01.401 --> 05:03.936
and if it's juicy,
I'm gonna need to know it.

05:04.003 --> 05:06.773
Mm, Sam, you must
write this article.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.775
But Flower's my only source,
and I can't even interview her.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.743
So just have
the ghosts do it.

05:10.810 --> 05:14.013
Yes. Yes. His mind
is as sharp as his jawline.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.549
And with questions
woven into conversation

05:16.616 --> 05:18.017
by her trusted
ghost friends,

05:18.084 --> 05:20.586
she will be
completely unaware.

05:20.653 --> 05:21.788
You think that'll work?

05:21.854 --> 05:24.590
The girl was staring at a shadow
for four hours yesterday,

05:24.657 --> 05:26.626
so yeah, I think
we can outfox her.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.631
Hey, babe, I...

05:31.698 --> 05:34.534
No one's gonna tell me
how that conversation ended?

05:40.173 --> 05:42.542
Oh, great, there
you are, Sasappis.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.610
Uh, seriously? Can I get
a roll call, please?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.913
Sure. Sasappis,
Pete, Trevor.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.748
That's never not gonna be weird.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.383
I ran into this Lenape ghost

05:50.450 --> 05:51.617
who died around
the same time as you,

05:51.684 --> 05:52.785
and I was wondering
if you knew her.

05:52.852 --> 05:53.986
Her name was Shiki.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.788
Shiki? What?
Are you serious?

05:55.855 --> 05:58.624
Did you just ask if two
Lenape people knew each other?

05:58.691 --> 05:59.759
She was the love
of my life.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.360
That's like me asking you

06:01.427 --> 06:02.862
if you know another
white lady from Ohio.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.864
Shh. He knew her.
They were in love.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.432
Well, I was in love
with her,

06:06.499 --> 06:08.367
and I thought she was
in love with me,

06:08.434 --> 06:10.103
so I killed a deer,
and brought it to her family.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.138
Sure.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.138
And then I never heard
from her again.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.506
Oh, my God.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.508
What? What happened?

06:13.573 --> 06:15.508
She ghosted him.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.943
What?

06:15.575 --> 06:16.943
Excuse me?

06:15.575 --> 06:16.943
Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?

06:17.009 --> 06:18.411
JAY: (chuckles)
I'm guessing

06:18.478 --> 06:19.879
they did not like
the ghosted thing.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.415
Oh, no, no, no.
Ghosting is what people say

06:22.482 --> 06:23.816
when you're dating someone,
and they just kind of vanish.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.052
Is the point that
ghosts have no manners?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.754
Walk me through this.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.856
Who knows what was going on
for Shiki 500 years ago.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.424
The point is she could be in

06:31.491 --> 06:32.592
a completely different
headspace now.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.660
I think you should
reach out.

06:34.727 --> 06:35.862
I can pass on a message.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.163
Uh, okay, yeah.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.065
Uh, how about,
"Shiki,

06:39.132 --> 06:41.400
"not a day has passed
since we parted

06:41.467 --> 06:42.969
"that I haven't
thought of you.

06:43.035 --> 06:45.004
You are the love of my life."

06:43.035 --> 06:45.004
JAY: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.973
That's coming on
way too strong.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.407
What's the difference?
They're ghosts,

06:48.474 --> 06:49.709
and they can't even be
in the same place.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.477
But they could be,
one day, right?

06:51.544 --> 06:54.046
I mean, you guys do,
eventually, go up, right?

06:54.113 --> 06:56.482
Get sucked off, right.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.482
SAMANTHA: Yes, in theory,
they could.

06:56.549 --> 06:59.552
Yeah, so he's got to play
this right, and I can help.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.454
I mean, this is
basically texting,

07:01.521 --> 07:03.022
and who's better at texting
than your hubs?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.091
Texting was just
catching on when I died.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.993
I would've loved to work
with the medium more.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.028
Sasappis, you should just say
what you want to say.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.998
Women value honesty
and romance, not games.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.567
(laughs)
That's so cute.

07:14.634 --> 07:15.902
When I first met you,
I wanted to text you

07:15.968 --> 07:17.537
every two minutes,

07:17.603 --> 07:18.971
but I didn't do that,
you want to know why?

07:19.038 --> 07:20.640
Because it would've
scared you off.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.441
Okay, listen to
this man, Sass.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.644
I'm not saying this is a Lyle
Lovett, Julia Roberts situation,

07:24.710 --> 07:25.778
but he did well
for himself.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.847
You know what
my dating strategy is?

07:27.914 --> 07:29.115
I like to get myself

07:29.182 --> 07:31.050
in something I call
"the friendzone."

07:31.117 --> 07:33.653
Now, nine out of ten times you
end up completely desexualized,

07:33.719 --> 07:35.454
as if you're a puppy
or their brother,

07:35.521 --> 07:36.656
but, at the end of the day,

07:36.722 --> 07:38.691
you got a new friend,
so win-win, right?

07:38.758 --> 07:40.593
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
with Jay on this one.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.796
Fine. Jay, Sasappis wants
to know what he should say.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.865
Okay, first of all,
delete that corny mess

07:45.932 --> 07:49.135
and repeat after me,
"'Sup," apostrophe,

07:49.202 --> 07:52.004
S-U-P. End it
with a period.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.973
It is a question,
but we don't care enough

07:54.040 --> 07:55.474
to put a question mark,
do we?

07:55.541 --> 07:57.210
Sup.

07:55.541 --> 07:57.210
Oh, this guy's good.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.011
I am ready
to be Miyagi'd.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.950
Oh, hello, Flower.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.786
Just popping in for a casual
chat amongst close friends.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.221
Oh, hey, guys.

08:08.287 --> 08:09.222
You know what I thought
was awesome, Isaac?

08:09.288 --> 08:10.890
Oh, what's that, Alberta?

08:10.957 --> 08:12.124
How my girl,
Flower, here

08:12.191 --> 08:13.993
stood up to Sam
about the bank robbery.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.595
That's not Sam's story
to tell,

08:15.661 --> 08:16.696
that's Flower's
thing.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.497
Agreed.

08:18.564 --> 08:20.533
Although, I'm curious

08:20.600 --> 08:22.501
as to why you didn't want her
to write the story.

08:22.568 --> 08:25.872
Considering how freely you
bless us with retellings of it.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.640
Well, just between us?

08:27.707 --> 08:28.808
Obviously.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.743
There's just a part of the story

08:30.810 --> 08:32.511
I'm not ready to tell.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.113
Mm, that's all
you need to say.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.113
Mm-hmm.

08:34.180 --> 08:37.617
Although, I'm worried that Sam,
conniving Living that she is,

08:37.683 --> 08:39.085
will find some way
to trick you

08:39.151 --> 08:40.620
into telling her
your dark secret.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.788
Do you think?

08:40.686 --> 08:42.788
It's a risk, though...

08:42.855 --> 08:44.524
Here's a thought,

08:44.590 --> 08:46.225
what if you were tell us
your deep, dark secret,

08:46.292 --> 08:48.961
so we can help steer Sam
as far away from it as possible?

08:49.028 --> 08:52.832
Wait, why are you guys asking me
so many questions about myself?

08:52.899 --> 08:54.901
What? Uh, it's
perfectly consistent

08:54.967 --> 08:56.669
with our personalities
to want to know more

08:56.736 --> 08:57.904
about our good old
friend, Flower.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.640
Well, if we're
such good friends,

09:00.706 --> 09:01.908
what's my last name?

09:09.982 --> 09:12.318
It's Montero.

09:09.982 --> 09:12.318
Montero!

09:12.385 --> 09:14.320
I knew that.
I remember that.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.320
Mm-hmm.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.322
Okay. So, here's
what I want to know,

09:16.389 --> 09:19.725
since you guys are acting
all suspicious and stuff...

09:22.929 --> 09:25.131
Oh, my God.
Is she still with us?

09:25.197 --> 09:26.599
What's going on?

09:25.197 --> 09:26.599
Hard to say.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.870
Wait, what-what were we
just talking about?

09:30.937 --> 09:32.004
It was important, wasn't it?

09:32.071 --> 09:33.806
You know,
I don't really recall.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.742
Oh, wait, was it love?

09:33.873 --> 09:36.742
Sure.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.077
Oh, I love love.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.679
I also hate tomatoes,

09:39.745 --> 09:41.781
and those are a couple
of things about me.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.049
Good to know.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.049
Uh, yes.

09:43.115 --> 09:44.317
I am glad we got
to the bottom of that.

09:44.383 --> 09:45.618
(both laugh)

09:48.154 --> 09:51.590
Hey. I gave Shiki
the message.

09:51.657 --> 09:52.825
It wasn't easy.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.627
The editor was very curious

09:54.694 --> 09:56.162
as to why I just showed up
with no appointment.

09:56.228 --> 09:57.697
Uh, you're back.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.865
Hey.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.865
Can I help you?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.634
Uh, I just stopped by
to let you know

10:01.701 --> 10:03.369
how things were going
with the article.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.904
Okay.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.206
Right, uh, so I
dropped by the bank,

10:07.273 --> 10:09.208
and they're putting me
in touch with a woman

10:09.275 --> 10:11.077
who was a young teller
at the time,

10:11.143 --> 10:14.246
so I'm gonna give her a call,
and that is where we're at.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.848
Okay, that's it, yeah.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.249
Uh, feels like this
could've been an email

10:17.316 --> 10:19.952
or a non-share, really.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.952
Mm.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.921
BOTH: So, what did she say?

10:20.019 --> 10:21.921
Did you read her the message?

10:21.988 --> 10:23.356
Yes, I did.

10:23.422 --> 10:24.991
I read the message
that you guys workshopped,

10:25.057 --> 10:27.626
and let me say again,
I was not a fan of it.

10:27.693 --> 10:30.663
"Sup. Cool you're
still around, Shiki.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.265
Would love to hear
the haps sometime. Maybe."

10:35.234 --> 10:38.871
That's-that's it.
That's all he said.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.139
"Sup"?

10:40.206 --> 10:42.308
And?

10:40.206 --> 10:42.308
And...

10:42.375 --> 10:44.844
she had a response.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.045
"Hey."

10:46.112 --> 10:49.148
"Hey"? That's it?

10:46.112 --> 10:49.148
Oh, she's good.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.217
What? How is that good?
What do we do now?

10:51.283 --> 10:53.119
Sasappis is freaking out,
which makes sense

10:53.185 --> 10:54.987
because, clearly,
that was terrible advice.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.122
No, no, no, no, no.

10:56.188 --> 10:58.858
If she's playing the game,
that means she's interested.

10:58.924 --> 11:01.227
All we have to do now
is craft the perfect reply.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.095
Good news is we have
a week to do it,

11:03.162 --> 11:04.864
anything sooner than that
is just thirsty.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.332
I am so out
of my element

11:06.399 --> 11:07.767
with this written
communication thing.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.802
Funny guys must
clean up these days.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.038
I'd be friendzoning
everybody, hard.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.276
Good news, Samantha.
We found out

11:17.343 --> 11:19.745
that Flower has a deep dark
secret about the robbery.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.247
Oh, amazing. What is it?

11:21.313 --> 11:23.949
No, no, that's it.
We just found out she has one.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.718
Is that enough to go off?

11:25.785 --> 11:27.119
ISAAC:
Now let's talk byline.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.121
Alberta and I are fine
if your name comes first,

11:29.188 --> 11:30.823
since you'll be doing
most of the typing.

11:30.890 --> 11:31.891
However...

11:31.957 --> 11:34.026
Okay, just had a pretty intense
acid flashback,

11:34.093 --> 11:36.162
but I remember before that,
you guys were asking me

11:36.228 --> 11:37.963
a bunch of questions
about the robbery.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.999
Why were you
doing that?

11:40.066 --> 11:42.968
Because... we're interested
in your life, Flower.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.704
And now you're talking to Sam,
who wanted to write the article

11:45.771 --> 11:47.907
about me before...

11:45.771 --> 11:47.907
Oh, my God,

11:47.973 --> 11:49.708
she's piecing it together
in real time.

11:49.775 --> 11:52.011
Nobody move. She has one
plus one, but I'm not confident

11:52.078 --> 11:53.379
she realizes
it makes two.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.881
This is ridiculous.
Flower, I'm sorry.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.383
The editor didn't like
my other ideas,

11:57.450 --> 11:59.418
and I was desperate,
so I pitched your story.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.922
Whoa. Not groovy, Sam.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.922
I know.

12:02.988 --> 12:04.323
It was wrong, but I still

12:04.390 --> 12:05.925
don't get why
you don't want the article.

12:05.991 --> 12:07.293
Yeah, what are you
hiding, Flower?

12:07.359 --> 12:08.794
Yes, just
tell us, Flower.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.796
Why are you
so afraid to share

12:10.863 --> 12:12.431
that which you claim to be
the most proud of?

12:12.498 --> 12:15.101
Because I'm not proud
of it, okay?

12:15.167 --> 12:16.936
The money never went
to any good cause.

12:17.002 --> 12:18.170
The commune never donated it.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.805
What? Why not?

12:19.872 --> 12:22.441
Because before they could
give it away, I stole it.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.510
(gasps)

12:25.911 --> 12:27.947
Really? No one else gasped?

12:28.013 --> 12:29.415
Well, I guess if you're
not gasping at that,

12:29.482 --> 12:31.150
you're simply not a gasper.

12:31.217 --> 12:31.817
(sighs)

12:36.188 --> 12:38.491
After the bank robbery,
the commune spent weeks debating

12:38.557 --> 12:40.926
what to do with the money.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.361
TED:
Seven...

12:42.428 --> 12:43.796
Eight...

12:43.863 --> 12:45.064
And... all right,

12:45.131 --> 12:49.835
so that's nine for helping out
the feral cats of Costa Rica.

12:49.902 --> 12:52.037
(sighs) And one
for narwhals.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.206
Damn it, Brenda.
It has to be unanimous.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.941
I'm not changing my vote.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.941
TED: Look,

12:56.008 --> 12:58.043
Brenda, the feral cats
of Costa Rica

12:58.110 --> 13:00.246
live in awful
conditions.

13:00.312 --> 13:03.516
They sleep
in the dirt.

13:03.582 --> 13:06.485
They-they have no escape
from the elements.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.988
They eat out of
the garbage.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.458
I have an idea.

13:12.525 --> 13:16.829
What if we used the money
to help people in need.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.298
Like, specifically, us.

13:21.901 --> 13:22.935
BRENDA:
No, guys,

13:23.002 --> 13:24.170
the narwhals need us.

13:24.236 --> 13:26.972
TED:
No, feral cats,
Brenda, come on.

13:27.039 --> 13:29.975
So, then Ira and I
took the money and bolted,

13:30.042 --> 13:31.544
and then I got attacked
by a bear,

13:31.610 --> 13:33.846
and I've had an eternity
to think about what I did.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.581
Well, it sounds like
you just made a mistake.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.217
No, Sam, I'm a fraud.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.419
I wanted to be a person
who helped others,

13:40.486 --> 13:44.156
but I just helped myself.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.495
Well, now I feel bad.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.495
Yeah, me, too.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.530
Sam should've never
written that article.

13:51.597 --> 13:53.499
But you told me to.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.068
We're dead, and just
looking for exciting things

13:56.135 --> 13:57.603
to happen around here
to fill up the days.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.205
Why are you
listening to us?

13:59.271 --> 14:01.373
(both laugh)

14:01.440 --> 14:03.175
SHIKI:
So...

14:03.242 --> 14:05.578
did you get a reply
from Sasappis for me?

14:05.644 --> 14:09.281
No, they all w--
Uh, he wanted me to wait a week.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.850
I don't know.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.850
Oh. Okay.

14:11.917 --> 14:12.985
I understand.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.186
Wait a minute.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.622
This is crazy.
He's playing games.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.857
And, as a woman,
I know you want the truth.

14:18.924 --> 14:21.627
The truth is Sasappis loves you,
and he's always loved you,

14:21.694 --> 14:23.062
and he always will love you,

14:23.128 --> 14:24.563
and I can't think
of a better person

14:24.630 --> 14:27.166
for you to hopefully one day
spend eternity with.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.302
Whoa. That's a little intense.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.971
Oh, God.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.971
Oh, no, no, no.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.173
It's cool, I guess.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.610
I-I got a thing
in the, uh, copy room.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.578
Oh, God, wait.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.080
Did you not want me to come in?

14:41.146 --> 14:42.448
To my office?

14:42.514 --> 14:44.583
I'm sorry, I need
to talk to you, Lewis.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.252
I really appreciate
the opportunity,

14:46.318 --> 14:48.554
but I can't write
the article.

14:46.318 --> 14:48.554
Excuse me?

14:48.621 --> 14:51.457
I just realized it would,
it would hurt a friend.

14:51.523 --> 14:53.626
Again, email.

14:53.692 --> 14:57.162
Okay, email. I get that.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.934
Knock, knock.

15:02.001 --> 15:04.336
I don't want to see anyone
right now, Alberta.

15:06.338 --> 15:07.906
I just have one thing
I got to tell you,

15:07.973 --> 15:09.174
then I'll leave you be.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.678
I never shared the stage
with Cab Calloway.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.913
I know I always brag
about that,

15:14.980 --> 15:16.248
but it didn't happen.

15:16.315 --> 15:19.018
I did share a cab
with him once.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.954
Nope! You know what?
Ah! I'm lying again.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.455
I never even met the man.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.026
And I was never at
the Boston Tea Party.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.494
I was in Boston

15:28.560 --> 15:29.928
at a tea party,

15:29.995 --> 15:32.164
but it was at
my Aunt Geraldine's house.

15:32.231 --> 15:33.432
It was a lovely affair.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.334
Why are you guys
telling me this?

15:35.401 --> 15:38.137
None of us lived up
to exactly who we wanted to be.

15:38.203 --> 15:40.005
ISAAC:
That doesn't
make you a fraud.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.141
You're the biggest do-gooder
of all us ghosts.

15:42.207 --> 15:44.076
Granted, that's
a selfish crew.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.577
(laughs)
But you set the bar,

15:45.644 --> 15:47.713
and you need
to know that.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.081
Thanks, guys.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.482
(footsteps approaching)

15:50.549 --> 15:52.451
Flower, hey.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.354
I wanted to tell you
I'm not gonna write the article,

15:55.421 --> 15:57.289
and I'm sorry I went
behind your back.

15:57.356 --> 16:00.492
You had a moment of weakness.
I know the feeling.

16:01.393 --> 16:03.295
Hmm, I wonder what Ira did
with all that money.

16:03.362 --> 16:05.731
Me, too. Ira wanted
to blow it all on a house,

16:05.798 --> 16:08.133
and I was like,
"No, we should open a business."

16:08.200 --> 16:10.336
You know, so we didn't
have to rob any more banks.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.537
Oh, what kind of business?

16:11.603 --> 16:13.172
A fair trade
coffee shop

16:13.238 --> 16:14.606
that totally paid
the bean farmers

16:14.673 --> 16:16.308
what they should get paid,
and was, like,

16:16.375 --> 16:18.610
not bad for the earth,
but Ira said,

16:18.677 --> 16:20.212
"Daisy, we don't know
the first thing

16:20.279 --> 16:21.347
about starting a business."

16:21.413 --> 16:22.681
Daisy?

16:22.748 --> 16:24.717
Yeah, that was
Ira's nickname for me

16:24.783 --> 16:26.985
'cause I was his special flower.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.188
Also, 'cause it's a weed
and I love weed.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.156
Come with me, now.

16:31.223 --> 16:32.424
Okay.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.664
What is this?

16:38.731 --> 16:40.632
It's your fair trade
coffee shop, Flower,

16:40.699 --> 16:42.701
except it's got, like,
a hundred locations.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.336
Someone stole my idea?

16:44.403 --> 16:46.338
Oh, she's so close
to getting it.

16:46.405 --> 16:47.506
God love her.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.042
Wow. Read this.

16:50.109 --> 16:53.679
"The founder of Daisy's
Coffee Shop is Ira Klein.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.481
"In memory of his
late girlfriend,

16:55.547 --> 16:58.217
"profits go toward
underprivileged communities

16:58.283 --> 16:59.618
and bear safety education."

16:59.685 --> 17:01.120
(chuckles)

17:01.186 --> 17:03.489
Ira made my dream come true.

17:03.555 --> 17:06.392
Now that is a good ending
to your article, Sam.

17:06.458 --> 17:07.659
Maybe you should just write it.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.128
Are you sure?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.397
I was so worried
about people, like,

17:11.463 --> 17:14.233
judging me for my
biggest mistake, but,

17:14.299 --> 17:16.201
now I see something
groovy came out of it.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.536
(chuckles)

17:17.603 --> 17:19.772
Also is anyone else
seeing that color?

17:19.838 --> 17:21.607
Is there even a name for that?

17:21.673 --> 17:23.709
And the horse
has left the stable.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.280
(door closes)

17:28.347 --> 17:29.615
Well, I have some news.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.583
Lewis loved
the bank robbery article.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.619
Yes!

17:31.650 --> 17:33.619
(cheers and applause)

17:33.685 --> 17:36.288
And-and he said Daisy's Coffee
Shop is even cool with it.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.357
Apparently, the statute
of limitations ran out,

17:38.424 --> 17:39.758
and they think it makes them
look badass.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.226
Ooh, they're
not wrong.

17:41.293 --> 17:42.728
Best news for last,

17:42.795 --> 17:44.663
he wants me to come in next week
to pitch more ideas.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.632
That's incredible. Babe,

17:46.698 --> 17:49.101
I'm so proud of you.

17:46.698 --> 17:49.101
Thank you.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.803
Alberta, I heard
you were very helpful

17:50.869 --> 17:52.805
with Sam's article, which I
thought should be acknowledged.

17:52.871 --> 17:55.073
Aw, thanks, Pete.
You're a good friend.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.476
Oh, friend. (chuckles)
Wow, thank you.

17:57.543 --> 18:00.412
(whispers): Hello,
friendzone. I'm in.

18:00.479 --> 18:01.480
(chuckles)

18:00.479 --> 18:01.480
JAY: While you are at

18:01.547 --> 18:05.384
the magazine, you can give Shiki

18:05.451 --> 18:07.085
her next message.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.287
Jay nailed it.

18:08.353 --> 18:11.490
It's, "yo yo yo."

18:11.557 --> 18:13.325
The simplicity,
right?

18:13.392 --> 18:14.860
SASAPPIS:
You know what? No.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.162
No more aloof messages.
I can't take the waiting.

18:17.229 --> 18:20.199
I can't take not being honest.
I'm not a games guy.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.066
I'm looking
for a woman

18:21.133 --> 18:22.668
who wants a dead deer
on her doorstep,

18:22.734 --> 18:24.837
and when I find her,
I'm gonna love her forever.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.605
I am so glad you said that

18:26.672 --> 18:29.575
because, the last time
I went in, I kind of lost it,

18:29.641 --> 18:31.343
and I basically said
exactly that.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.345
What? Well, what'd she say?
Did she like it?

18:33.412 --> 18:34.746
Not really.

18:34.813 --> 18:36.582
Seriously?

18:36.648 --> 18:37.749
Fix this. Jay!

18:37.816 --> 18:39.751
Uh, he can't hear you.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.751
What's he saying?

18:39.818 --> 18:41.720
I want the games back, please.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.255
He's thanking me.

18:43.322 --> 18:44.756
You ruined
everything.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.692
You're welcome.

18:46.758 --> 18:49.895
Hey, did I ever tell you guys
about the time I robbed a bank?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.563
(all groaning)

18:49.962 --> 18:51.563
Okay.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.770
Okay, I mean,
I get it.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.472
I guess people
just play games,

19:00.539 --> 19:03.375
but I don't love that
my husband is so good at it.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.576
(chuckles) Okay.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.378
I've been meaning
to show you this

19:06.445 --> 19:08.280
for a while now.

19:08.347 --> 19:11.350
Here. This is a screengrab
of a text that I sent you

19:11.416 --> 19:13.685
exactly one minute
after your cab pulled away,

19:13.752 --> 19:15.153
the night
of our first date.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.389
Oh, cute.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.389
Read it.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.258
"Samcakes...
is it okay

19:19.324 --> 19:20.859
"that I call you that?

19:20.926 --> 19:23.161
"I feel like that'll be
my nickname for you.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.864
I'll call you Samcakes
and you'll call me Jay-bae"?

19:25.931 --> 19:27.633
I know. Keep reading.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.201
"I know you're not supposed
to say stuff like that,

19:29.268 --> 19:30.836
"and maybe I'm tipsy,
but I like you.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.338
"Like, really like you.

19:33.405 --> 19:36.542
And I think you
might be the one."

19:36.608 --> 19:38.176
Oh, I never got that text.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.678
Yeah, because
by some grace of God

19:39.745 --> 19:40.846
it never went through.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.949
Okay, yeah, I would've
run for the hills.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.851
Obviously.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.851
I mean, you were psycho.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.287
That guy's gonna crawl inside of
your skin and wear you to prom.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.488
SASAPPIS:
Okay, see?

19:49.555 --> 19:50.756
Now will you help me?

19:49.555 --> 19:50.756
Fine, Sass.

19:50.822 --> 19:54.192
Shiki will get a
"yo yo yo" on Tuesday.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.595
I can't believe I'm using
my ghost powers for this,

19:56.662 --> 19:59.364
but, I guess, if it means
you two could end up together

19:59.431 --> 20:01.667
to do whatever it is
that ghosts do...

20:01.733 --> 20:03.569
I was wondering about this.
So, tell me,

20:03.635 --> 20:05.537
can ghosts actually have sex?

20:05.604 --> 20:08.540
We can. We just can't finish.
It's very frustrating.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.542
He says they can,
but they can't finish.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.210
Interesting.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.210
Gosh, I hate to do this,

20:12.277 --> 20:13.512
but I've got some work to do.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.547
No, no, no, no, no.
Sam, first question,

20:15.614 --> 20:17.215
can they take off
their own clothes?

20:17.282 --> 20:19.251
Sam, come back, I want
to tell Jay about ghost sex.
