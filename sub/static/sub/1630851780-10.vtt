WEBVTT

00:59.726 --> 01:02.028
Have they replied yet?

01:03.963 --> 01:05.932
As soon as I hand over the file,

01:06.533 --> 01:08.268
I'll start planning our trip.

01:09.135 --> 01:10.303
But we're almost there.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.372
My probationary period
has just ended.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.040
If it's not now,
we won't be able to do it.

01:15.341 --> 01:18.445
We need to get out of this cit.
Please, we need to breathe.

01:18.511 --> 01:19.579
Sofia needs that.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.781
I know. We're going to do it.

01:21.848 --> 01:23.917
Trust me, we're almost there.

01:25.218 --> 01:27.654
-I want to go too.
-It doesn't look like it!

01:27.720 --> 01:30.757
I'm figuring all out.
It's the system. Be patient.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.372
-Shall we go for a walk?
-Sure.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.046
Have you seen the girl
that was with us?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.115
-Have you seen her?
-She's a little girl.

01:58.084 --> 01:59.052
With a ponytail.

02:00.753 --> 02:01.855
Sofia!

02:01.921 --> 02:03.189
Have you seen a girl

02:03.256 --> 02:04.958
wearing black trousers
and a blue shirt?

02:56.042 --> 02:57.977
EPISODE:
SOFIA

02:59.779 --> 03:02.148
This can't be possible.

03:06.819 --> 03:07.787
Tell me.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.525
It's your only chance
to redeem yourself.

03:14.594 --> 03:17.130
If there's a shred of humanity
left inside of you,

03:18.264 --> 03:19.832
tell me what you did to Sofia

03:21.100 --> 03:22.669
and to all the families
you destroyed

03:22.735 --> 03:23.836
when you took their children.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.239
You'll pay dearly
for all the pain you caused

03:26.306 --> 03:27.807
to those families.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.342
And my family too!

03:29.909 --> 03:33.012
Where's Sofia?
Where's my daughter?

03:33.079 --> 03:34.480
What did you do to her?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.750
Speak! Where is my daughter?

03:37.817 --> 03:39.752
Where is Sofia? Let go of me!

03:39.819 --> 03:40.887
Sofia's toy.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.121
Let go of me, damn it!

03:42.188 --> 03:43.456
It's in the drawer.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.024
-Let go of me!
-It's in the drawer.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.426
Let go of me!

04:31.938 --> 04:32.939
MISSING

06:31.391 --> 06:34.427
Hi. We need to help Raul.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.864
There are many new things
happening here.

06:39.298 --> 06:40.733
I have never seen all this.

06:42.368 --> 06:43.336
You need to come here.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.349
Is there any more information?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.784
I think
that's everything, Edith.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.857
If I say "good morning",
it's going to sound fake.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.796
Hey, I don't understand.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.231
What are you doing here?

07:13.065 --> 07:14.367
Are you hiding something
from me?

07:28.381 --> 07:29.348
Yes.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.852
It's our turn to help, Raul.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.235
Waldir?

07:49.802 --> 07:51.037
Is he still sleeping?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.575
Petrônio!

07:56.676 --> 07:57.877
Petrônio, my love.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.483
I'm so happy for your visit.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.887
I missed you so much!

08:12.425 --> 08:14.727
Why don't you tell me
about your...

08:15.862 --> 08:17.129
old job?

08:19.999 --> 08:20.967
Tell me.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.236
What was it like?

08:24.637 --> 08:25.605
God!

08:36.415 --> 08:38.284
I need to know, Mirtes.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.093
Rodrigo?

08:48.160 --> 08:49.629
You came for me?

08:50.796 --> 08:52.698
Sofia Fagnani, five years old.

08:52.765 --> 08:55.968
She disappeared in MASP Park,
on Paulista Avenue,

08:56.035 --> 08:58.504
on May 13, 2007.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.506
This is an image

09:00.573 --> 09:03.442
of what she would look like
now, at 18.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.178
I'll skip the part you all know.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.648
The important this is,
I have new information.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.018
Mauricio Costa.

09:12.418 --> 09:13.986
Key element
for this investigation.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.955
I'm trying to get
more information

09:16.022 --> 09:17.757
on Mauricio's contact network.

09:17.823 --> 09:21.794
Good. Damasceno dismantled
an illegal adoption gang.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.764
That guy is linked to that gang.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.501
Damasceno also found out
about a deserted party house,

09:28.568 --> 09:31.070
which was a the base
of this gang.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.339
That took me here.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.810
And the DNA test result

09:38.444 --> 09:41.013
-took me...
-To the girl's mother.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.449
Are we completely sure

09:43.516 --> 09:45.918
that the bones found
belong to that woman's daughter?

09:45.985 --> 09:48.621
Maria Júlia, you need to give me
something concrete, real,

09:48.688 --> 09:50.356
instead of questioning
everything.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.326
I've spent 13 years collecting
the pieces of this story.

09:53.392 --> 09:54.560
I have something real now.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.862
I found a clue,
and it's a very good one.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.764
-I know, Raul.
-Tell me, Maria Júlia.

09:58.831 --> 10:01.434
What's your theory
on my daughter's disappearance?

10:01.500 --> 10:02.435
I'm sorry.

10:02.802 --> 10:03.970
I have no theory.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.839
I just think,

10:06.906 --> 10:08.608
since you are
emotionally involved,

10:08.674 --> 10:10.743
you can be prejudicial
to the case.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.745
We are with you, Raul.

10:12.812 --> 10:15.681
We're just trying to understand
all the steps.

10:15.748 --> 10:16.882
Right, Maria?

10:17.383 --> 10:19.085
What did you get from Mirtes?

10:19.518 --> 10:21.287
She has Alzheimer's disease.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.455
She's able to speak today.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.459
But from tomorrow she might not
be able to speak ever again.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.161
But she pronounced
my daughter's name.

10:29.228 --> 10:30.363
She said "Sofia".

10:30.429 --> 10:31.998
I'm trying to find
more information

10:32.064 --> 10:35.401
about the people that worked
at that party house in 2007.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.103
-Maybe.
-I think I could get

10:37.169 --> 10:38.437
more information from there.

10:47.713 --> 10:50.249
TWO MISSING CALLS
GUIOMAR

10:52.451 --> 10:54.687
You have reached the voicemail.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.555
Leave a message after the tone.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.191
Hi, Guiomar.
I've missed your calls.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.460
Call me back as soon as you can.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.402
Where are you going, Raul? Raul!

11:13.072 --> 11:15.241
According to the register,
she didn't receive visitors.

11:15.641 --> 11:16.609
Nobody.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.880
Accept it, Isadora.

11:20.946 --> 11:23.516
I've got three children.
Your husband is unemployed.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.691
Did you get the number
of her previous caregiver?

11:32.191 --> 11:33.659
-I talked to her.
-Really?

11:33.726 --> 11:36.095
She said that once,
a long time ago,

11:36.162 --> 11:38.064
Mirtes was visited by a woman.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.665
-Nothing else.
-A woman? Who?

11:40.633 --> 11:41.734
She doesn't remember.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.269
Tell me who she is.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.438
I told you not to come back!

11:45.504 --> 11:47.239
Look at me. Who is that woman?

11:47.306 --> 11:49.208
I'm sorry. Calm, Mrs. Mirtes.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.645
That bastard ruined Rose's life!

11:52.712 --> 11:53.913
-Who is Rose?
-You should...

11:53.979 --> 11:56.148
Who is Rose?
Tell me who Rose is!

11:56.215 --> 11:58.317
Go, Waldir. Leave now!

11:58.984 --> 12:01.153
You'll tell me the name
of the woman that visited her.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.321
Who spoke to Mirtes? Tell me!

12:02.388 --> 12:04.256
She doesn't remember.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.358
She remembers just a detail.

12:06.425 --> 12:08.828
She seemed to have a tattoo
on her arm.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.629
-That's not just a detail.
-Now leave.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.131
You'll make things worse.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.836
Calm down, Mrs. Mirtes.
Calm down, please.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.004
Mirtes was involved
in this plan.

12:19.839 --> 12:20.973
It's a good clue.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.910
You dismantled that gang, right?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.346
Yes, I helped you
as much as I could.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.682
Get your team
investigate her life.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.751
Just add Mirtes
to your investigations.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.052
That's all.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.854
I'm taking care of the rest.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.156
-I can't, Raul.
-What the hell, Damasceno?

12:37.223 --> 12:38.758
How long have we known
each other?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.193
That woman
is the only clue I have.

12:44.396 --> 12:45.564
What's going on, Dama?

12:45.631 --> 12:48.167
They will fall upon you too now.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.174
-What are you talking about?
-They will go after your agency.

12:55.541 --> 12:56.776
I won't be able to stop them.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.812
Our method
is a bit different from yours.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.114
But all that we do

13:02.181 --> 13:05.017
is give families
a little bit of console.

13:05.084 --> 13:07.286
The problem is that Maria Júlia

13:07.353 --> 13:09.822
messed with Emilio León Ramírez.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.458
That man has contacts
in the police, in politics.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.361
When it comes to those deals,
you know there is big money.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.530
Do you think
I can stop that man?

13:18.397 --> 13:20.766
I can't believe your employee
messed with him!

13:21.100 --> 13:24.236
He found out where she works.
Ramírez will ruin her life!

13:24.603 --> 13:25.938
They are big fish!

13:26.005 --> 13:28.207
They are not the petty criminals
you usually deal with.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.510
And they are coming for you.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.581
Have you listened
to anything I said?

13:36.916 --> 13:38.784
I don't care about
what is going to happen.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.621
I'm just asking you for help

13:42.922 --> 13:44.857
to find my daughter.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.525
That's my main concern.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.863
You don't deserve that chair.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.804
Tell me, Tai.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.072
Hi, Raul.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.041
You know? Just in the city
of São Paulo,

14:02.107 --> 14:04.810
I found 40 clinics
with a patient named Rose.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.013
For complaints,
call Consumer Affairs.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.782
You're lucky
because I'm a genius.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.684
Only five Roses have a tattoo.

14:15.287 --> 14:16.422
Is Damasceno going to help?

14:16.989 --> 14:18.290
It seems you made it.

14:19.124 --> 14:20.259
This thing about your father.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.695
Ramírez is after you,

14:22.761 --> 14:24.096
and I'll deal
with the consequences.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.198
Why you, Raul?

14:27.233 --> 14:28.701
What on earth were you thinking?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.971
I told you not to lie to me
anymore.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.339
I didn't lie to you.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.275
I just didn't tell you
because I wanted to protect you.

14:36.342 --> 14:39.411
Well, your double life
is starting to ruin mine.

14:43.015 --> 14:43.983
Thank you.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.540
Hi, Rose.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.845
What a beautiful baby girl.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.381
Is she your daughter?

15:16.482 --> 15:18.317
Do you know Mirtes, Rose?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.490
Rose, someone is at risk.
I just...

15:24.556 --> 15:26.458
Mom doesn't know
anything, right?

15:26.525 --> 15:28.160
Mom doesn't know anything
about anybody.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.162
Mom doesn't know.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.300
I'll show you a photo.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.202
-I don't know...
-Look.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.206
Do you know her?

15:41.273 --> 15:42.641
Help us, Rose.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.854
Nobody's going to take you
away from me, dear.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.123
Look, this is for you.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.194
Eat this cookie. Eat it.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.430
Eat up.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.165
Come on, eat it.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.601
Do you know this place?

16:11.236 --> 16:12.204
Look at it.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.406
It's a party house.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.576
Rose, have you ever been
to this place?

16:18.444 --> 16:19.411
Look.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.986
It's just you and me.
Just you and me, girl.

16:27.052 --> 16:28.120
Just you and me.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.022
-He wants to take my daughter!
-I don't.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.390
-Have you seen her?
-Help.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.459
Relax. I don't want to take
your daughter.

16:33.525 --> 16:34.860
-Let go of me!
-Calm down.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.095
Let go of me!

16:40.165 --> 16:41.667
You killed my daughter.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.835
-You killed my daughter!
-No.

16:42.901 --> 16:44.203
Nei is going to finish you off.

16:44.269 --> 16:45.571
-Nei?
-Nei is going to kill you!

16:45.637 --> 16:48.073
-Who is Nei?
-Relax, Raul. Calm down.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.708
Nei?

16:50.542 --> 16:52.711
Did you see her reaction
when I showed her the photo?

16:52.778 --> 16:54.013
-She knows something!
-I know.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.547
I know.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.484
We have a simple life.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.186
Rose is going
through a tough moment.

17:01.253 --> 17:02.388
I work in construction.

17:02.921 --> 17:05.557
I can't afford a better place
for her to be looked after.

17:06.091 --> 17:07.726
I'll be honest with you, Nei.

17:10.662 --> 17:12.931
I showed this photo
to your wife.

17:13.632 --> 17:14.800
And she freaked out.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.302
Do you know that girl?

17:17.736 --> 17:18.704
She's pretty.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.074
But I've never seen her.

17:23.642 --> 17:24.910
Did something happen to her?

17:24.977 --> 17:25.944
Yes.

17:27.613 --> 17:28.714
Tell me about Rose.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.517
Why is she like that?

17:31.583 --> 17:33.619
Rose is all over the place.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.120
When we lost our daughter,

17:35.187 --> 17:36.288
she got depressed.

17:36.355 --> 17:39.024
What happened to the kid?

17:39.091 --> 17:40.059
Meningitis.

17:40.993 --> 17:41.960
She was two.

17:44.029 --> 17:46.131
Time went by,
and Rose got worse.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.936
I learnt you don't visit her.

17:51.837 --> 17:52.805
You don't go there.

17:53.872 --> 17:54.840
Is there any problem?

17:57.076 --> 17:59.411
She gets really upset
when I'm there.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.680
I can't stand
seeing her like that.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.715
And I need to move on
with my life.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.018
-Right?
-I see.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.756
Nei, would you mind
going with me?

18:11.390 --> 18:13.559
So that we can talk to Rose.

18:13.625 --> 18:14.693
It's too painful for me.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.662
I really need you to go with me.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.566
Call me, and we sort it out.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.006
Thank you.

18:32.978 --> 18:34.580
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

18:35.547 --> 18:36.515
Thank you.

18:44.923 --> 18:45.891
Guiomar?

18:48.961 --> 18:49.928
Come in, dear.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.064
Close the door, please.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.105
Did something happen?
Is everything okay?

19:07.713 --> 19:09.047
What's going on? You scare me.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.853
I already checked.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.123
The sender doesn't exist.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.560
I WILL GIVE YOUR LIFE
BACK TO YOU.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.495
I AM ALWAYS WITH YOU, MY DEAR.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.636
Who gave you this?
Where did it come from?

19:30.702 --> 19:32.371
I don't know. When I came,
it was already here.

19:32.437 --> 19:33.972
The Mother Superior had it.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.709
I don't have
any more information, Melina.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.580
But this is a lot already.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.485
He's alive, Guiomar! He's alive!

19:47.886 --> 19:49.021
Mi father's alive!

19:52.524 --> 19:53.492
Nei.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.694
Nei, what can you give me?

19:55.761 --> 19:57.796
I did it! It's done, Raul.
Come here.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.132
In 2007, Rose submitted
an application

20:00.199 --> 20:02.034
for an in vitro fertilization
treatment

20:02.100 --> 20:04.436
at the Infertilidade Conjugal
Clinic of Santa Casa.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.238
Back then, it was financed
by the government.

20:06.805 --> 20:09.641
From 2010 to 2013,
she was admitted to two clinics.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.911
Casa de Saúde São João,
in Vila Jaraguá,

20:12.978 --> 20:15.113
and Mental Health Hospital
of São Conrado,

20:15.180 --> 20:16.315
where she currently is.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.050
Waldir, try to talk to Nei.

20:18.116 --> 20:19.551
Arrange to meet him

20:20.152 --> 20:22.321
at the mental health clinic
where Rose is.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.056
-Let's see if she wants to help.
-Okay.

20:25.457 --> 20:26.458
Tai?

20:28.260 --> 20:29.328
Check if you can find

20:29.394 --> 20:31.363
their daughter's
death certificate

20:31.430 --> 20:33.398
under the name of Nei or Rose.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.467
She was two.

20:35.534 --> 20:38.437
Let me see.
That is really easy to do.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.872
There's a great website.
You can find anything you want.

20:40.939 --> 20:42.274
Death certificates,

20:42.341 --> 20:44.243
IDs, birth dates,

20:44.309 --> 20:45.510
family trees.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.746
Here. Death...

20:47.813 --> 20:49.414
Okay, there's one of his father,

20:50.449 --> 20:52.884
one of his mother
and one of her brother.

20:52.951 --> 20:54.486
No death certificate of a kid.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.288
Where's Maria Júlia?

20:56.355 --> 20:58.023
-She doesn't want to work today?
-Here I am.

20:58.490 --> 20:59.992
I heard almost everything.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.662
I talked to Nei. He seems
to be willing to cooperate.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.530
Make sure he doesn't change
his mind.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.366
Use your charm
to make sure of it.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.500
Easy, Raul.

21:08.900 --> 21:09.835
Charming.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.571
Maria Júlia,
you're coming with me.

21:22.681 --> 21:24.349
I didn't think
it would be this hard.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.385
You're going to make it.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.468
Raul? Come, help me.

22:41.259 --> 22:42.928
-Hi, Waldir.
-Nei didn't show up.

22:42.994 --> 22:44.696
He's not answering his phone.

22:44.763 --> 22:45.997
He stood me up.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.466
What should I do?

22:47.532 --> 22:49.101
I don't know. Look for him.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.403
-Work this out. Talk to Tai.
-Okay.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.437
Thanks.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.726
Don't move,
or I'll kill both of you.

23:20.732 --> 23:21.867
-Shoot.
-I'm serious.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.168
What did you do to my daughter?

23:24.269 --> 23:25.604
Next time,
I'll aim for your chest.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.339
Where is my daughter? Tell me.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.673
Put your gun down.

23:39.117 --> 23:41.219
Now sit down, Raul. Sit down!

23:45.090 --> 23:46.324
I know who you are, Raul.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.126
You have to believe me.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.965
Everything I did,
I did it out of love.

23:54.032 --> 23:56.835
You'll rot in jail, bastard!

23:56.902 --> 23:58.236
You don't know anything.

23:59.571 --> 24:00.839
I saved the girl.

24:03.508 --> 24:05.076
Where is my daughter? Tell me!

24:05.744 --> 24:06.711
I don't know.

24:07.145 --> 24:09.881
We tried to give her
a good life.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.050
-We tried.
-Where is my daughter?

24:12.117 --> 24:13.084
Bastard!

24:14.152 --> 24:16.421
I did my best for my daughter.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.493
Depression was killing Rose.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.862
She wasn't able to have babies.
She never was.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.831
But it was her dream.

24:26.498 --> 24:27.732
She never hurt anyone.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.735
I was in charge of the security
at the party house.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.370
I heard everything
that went on there.

24:34.539 --> 24:35.607
And Sofia...

24:36.808 --> 24:39.010
She was such a pretty girl.

24:39.411 --> 24:40.445
So well-mannered.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.015
I couldn't let them hurt her.

24:44.683 --> 24:45.650
But...

24:46.384 --> 24:48.320
I didn't manage
to make my daughter

24:48.386 --> 24:49.521
a happy child.

24:50.822 --> 24:51.990
I didn't.

24:54.392 --> 24:55.360
She...

24:59.297 --> 25:01.399
Nei, don't do it! Please, Nei!

25:01.867 --> 25:04.970
Nei, stop! Don't do this to me.
What were you saying?

25:05.036 --> 25:06.671
Don't do this to me!
Nei, please!

25:07.672 --> 25:09.674
She...? What?

25:09.741 --> 25:10.709
Tell me!

25:11.543 --> 25:14.479
Damn it! Don't die, you bastard!

25:14.546 --> 25:16.181
Was it you?

25:16.848 --> 25:18.383
I saved your life, man!

25:21.419 --> 25:22.921
We just tried to give her love.

25:24.556 --> 25:26.925
Is your mouth tasting
like metal?

25:26.992 --> 25:28.793
Death is coming for you.

25:29.394 --> 25:30.362
Is it?

25:31.263 --> 25:33.098
If I had left her there,
she would...

25:33.164 --> 25:35.700
Did you touch her?
Talk, bastard!

25:35.767 --> 25:37.702
-Did you abuse her?
-Of course not.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.506
I wouldn't have let them
touch her.

25:41.973 --> 25:44.075
It was big. Huge sums of money.

25:44.409 --> 25:46.945
When I found out
they were taking her abroad,

25:47.012 --> 25:49.381
I thought about Rose,
desperate to have a child,

25:49.447 --> 25:50.415
and I didn't even blink.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.450
I took her.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.087
For God's sake.

25:57.188 --> 25:58.690
For the love of God.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.259
Is she alive?

26:02.460 --> 26:03.428
I don't know.

26:04.663 --> 26:06.264
She disappeared three years ago

26:07.232 --> 26:10.268
after she learnt
she was adopted.

26:10.335 --> 26:11.369
She got really upset.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.472
She wanted to know the truth,
but I couldn't tell her.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.042
She started dating

26:18.109 --> 26:19.311
a dangerous boy.

26:20.045 --> 26:21.012
And she left.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.348
What boy?

26:23.882 --> 26:24.849
They call him Magrão.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.353
He's involved in drug traffic
in Crackland.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.128
-Come.
-Where are you taking him?

26:37.195 --> 26:38.663
You are taking him
to the hospital now.

26:39.197 --> 26:41.132
-Now!
-Come here, Waldir.

26:41.199 --> 26:42.300
No! Tai?

26:42.367 --> 26:44.135
Get my bag and my car keys.

26:44.703 --> 26:46.104
Maria Júlia, help me.

26:47.906 --> 26:48.873
Let's go!

26:54.079 --> 26:55.880
Stop! Stop!

26:57.082 --> 26:59.084
I know who will take us
to that boy.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.019
Come on.

27:28.947 --> 27:29.914
Where is Rafa?

27:30.615 --> 27:31.716
Where is Rafa?

27:48.867 --> 27:49.801
Calm. Calm.

27:50.568 --> 27:52.537
Do you have any money
to give me?

27:53.338 --> 27:54.472
I'm your father!

27:55.507 --> 27:56.875
Look at me, Rafa.

27:57.308 --> 27:58.410
I'm your father!

28:00.278 --> 28:01.613
Why did you get to this, Rafa?

28:03.748 --> 28:05.316
My Lord, you stink, son!

28:05.850 --> 28:07.752
Do you want to take me home?
I won't go.

28:08.553 --> 28:09.954
-Home?
-I won't take you home.

28:10.021 --> 28:10.989
Look at me.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.759
I need you to help me
find someone.

28:14.826 --> 28:15.927
Do you remember uncle Raul?

28:20.098 --> 28:21.900
I need you to tell me
where this person is.

28:21.966 --> 28:23.835
He is linked
to Sofia's disappearance.

28:23.902 --> 28:25.570
Do you remember Sofia?
Do you remember her?

28:28.006 --> 28:29.941
I need you to tell me
where Magrão is.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.277
Where is Magrão?

28:32.343 --> 28:35.080
You know
they're going to kill me.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.450
Rafa, trust me.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.453
Trust me. Where is Magrão?

28:43.054 --> 28:44.656
Don't tell anyone
that I told you.

28:45.290 --> 28:48.793
This is the most important thing
you'll ever do in your life.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.228
-Trust me.
-Okay.

28:50.295 --> 28:51.262
Tell me.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.798
Don't tell anyone.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.800
Magrão always gets us
the good stuff.

28:56.768 --> 28:59.537
I learnt he's been going
where his cousin is.

29:00.138 --> 29:01.172
A job.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.174
What's his cousin's name?

29:04.008 --> 29:05.577
Rafa? Rafa!

29:06.611 --> 29:08.646
Rafa, trust me.

29:09.714 --> 29:10.782
Trust me, son.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.753
Fiona.

29:21.059 --> 29:23.461
I'll leave some money for you
at Carioca bar.

29:24.028 --> 29:26.598
Use it to buy food,
not this junk.

29:26.664 --> 29:28.099
Use it to buy food, okay?

29:38.109 --> 29:39.077
Not now, Raul.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.450
I'll get into your phone anyway.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.553
If you give me your password,
it will be quicker, okay?

29:55.760 --> 29:58.029
What are you doing? Are you mad?

29:58.496 --> 30:00.265
We're trying to help you,
don't you see?

30:01.699 --> 30:04.135
Help me, Nei.
I don't want to hurt you.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.539
I need that information.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.009
Tell us.

30:11.509 --> 30:13.278
Come on, tell us!

30:13.344 --> 30:14.312
Speak!

30:23.321 --> 30:25.089
It looks like
she's the boss here.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.793
She must be Fiona.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.563
Listen.

30:31.629 --> 30:34.399
This is Magrão.
It was on Nei's phone.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.568
He said
he was looking for her too.

30:37.435 --> 30:39.204
You have to thank Maria Júlia.

30:43.274 --> 30:44.309
Is that Magrão?

31:03.328 --> 31:04.295
Fiona?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.931
Hi, man. All of this is legal.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.600
I was granted authorization
for it.

31:08.666 --> 31:10.235
If you want weed,
talk to the boss.

31:10.301 --> 31:11.436
I want to ask you a question.

31:11.502 --> 31:13.371
A difficult question
or an easy question?

31:13.438 --> 31:14.906
I was going to say that.

31:14.973 --> 31:18.476
Listen, we are not policemen.
We just want to talk to Magrão.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.578
I don't know him.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.580
We can cause you trouble.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.349
Listen.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.950
The problem... Stop!

31:26.718 --> 31:29.354
We have nothing against you.
Just tell us where Magrão is.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.990
Magrão? Stop bothering me.
I don't know him.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.025
-Stop!
-Damn it!

31:34.092 --> 31:35.994
You know where Magrão is.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.028
Tell me where he is.

31:40.164 --> 31:41.699
Easy. If you tell me everything,
you are going to live.

31:41.766 --> 31:44.702
I told the other guys already.
I'm raising money to pay you.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.170
Give me some more days.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.705
What are you talking about?

31:50.808 --> 31:51.776
Damn it.

33:04.716 --> 33:05.683
No.

33:08.286 --> 33:09.854
Let's see where he takes us.

33:25.536 --> 33:26.504
Hi.

33:27.138 --> 33:28.106
Here.

33:33.211 --> 33:34.178
Thank you.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.783
Where is Magrão's house?

33:41.152 --> 33:42.320
See that lane?

33:42.387 --> 33:45.857
At the end of it,
there's a house with stairs

33:45.923 --> 33:47.692
and a sign
that reads "For sale".

33:49.460 --> 33:50.595
A sign that reads "For sale".

33:51.796 --> 33:52.764
Okay.

33:53.564 --> 33:55.400
Wait! Where are you going?

33:56.134 --> 33:57.702
I'll go there. I'll let you know
if I find something out.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.604
-It's too risky.
-It's your daughter, Raul.

34:00.571 --> 34:01.939
I don't care about the risk.

34:04.876 --> 34:05.910
Wait.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.676
-Hi, Magrão, do you hear me?
-Yes.

34:38.743 --> 34:39.811
-Are you there?
-I am.

34:39.877 --> 34:41.512
Do you hear me, Magrão?
Talk to me!

34:42.046 --> 34:43.014
Listen.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.450
They'll catch us
if we don't run away.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.985
-I won't go back to this hell!
-You won't.

34:48.052 --> 34:50.188
Tell me what the hell
happened, Magrão.

34:50.254 --> 34:53.424
The police are chasing me.
They want their money.

34:53.491 --> 34:54.725
They almost caught me today.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.694
I don't have the money
to pay them.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.396
They will finish us off.

34:58.463 --> 35:00.865
I'm hiding here, you know?

35:00.932 --> 35:02.433
Get your stuff and come here.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.168
We are going
to aunt Ivone's house.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.704
We'll be there for a while
until everything quiets down.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.006
How will I get there? How?

35:09.073 --> 35:10.908
Damn it, woman!
Are you with me or not?

35:10.975 --> 35:13.277
Steal a car on your way!
I don't know!

35:26.724 --> 35:27.792
And?

35:27.859 --> 35:30.261
Next time you do
something like that, you're out!

35:31.028 --> 35:32.763
At least you know
he's running away.

35:32.830 --> 35:35.133
And maybe he leads us to her.

35:35.199 --> 35:38.169
If we put some pressure on him,
we can work this out.

35:38.236 --> 35:39.203
No.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.939
We need to see
what he's going to do.

36:00.925 --> 36:01.893
Waldir.

36:04.228 --> 36:05.196
I saw him.

36:06.130 --> 36:07.765
Come on. Be careful.

36:25.683 --> 36:26.784
Tell me, Tai.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.587
It's under the name
of Antônio Hambruck Condi.

36:29.654 --> 36:31.322
If it was stolen,
it was something recent.

36:31.389 --> 36:32.590
It's not in the system.

36:33.090 --> 36:34.058
Okay.

36:34.926 --> 36:35.860
Don't lose him.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.030
There. They turned to the right.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.114
Fast!

37:02.954 --> 37:03.921
What the hell!

37:14.365 --> 37:15.433
Stop!

37:15.499 --> 37:16.467
Stop!

37:16.801 --> 37:18.002
Stop, damn it!

37:18.069 --> 37:19.170
Stop!

37:28.079 --> 37:29.947
Don't run! Stop!

37:30.781 --> 37:32.316
Put the gun on the ground.

37:34.018 --> 37:35.753
Stop! Don't run!

37:36.387 --> 37:37.355
Stop!

37:37.722 --> 37:39.590
It's over! Come down!

37:40.091 --> 37:41.759
Come down and don't move!

37:43.427 --> 37:45.129
Put your hands on your head.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.619
-Let him go.
-If you come closer, I kill him.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.488
-Calm. We won't hurt you.
-Just go.

38:11.656 --> 38:12.623
Leave me.

38:29.173 --> 38:30.141
Walk.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.443
Your keys. Come on!

38:34.312 --> 38:35.279
Get in.

38:39.116 --> 38:40.117
Raul!

38:46.357 --> 38:47.325
Come on, damn it!

38:47.825 --> 38:49.860
Calm. What do you want me to do?

38:51.262 --> 38:53.497
-Come on, man, drive!
-Calm down.

38:53.564 --> 38:54.965
-Drive.
-Calm down. Okay.

39:05.142 --> 39:06.110
Come on, damn it!

39:16.487 --> 39:17.455
Get out of the car!

39:18.956 --> 39:20.358
Don't run. Stay there.

40:03.534 --> 40:04.468
Is it her?

40:09.006 --> 40:09.974
There's more.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.645
I'll take care of this.
Resume the inspection.

40:17.314 --> 40:18.682
Two pounds at least
of crack cocaine.

40:20.484 --> 40:22.553
If I report this,
you know what happens, right?

40:26.457 --> 40:27.825
I'll put it on the boy.

40:28.225 --> 40:29.193
Do the right thing.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.398
Are you sure?

40:36.534 --> 40:38.068
It's the only way
to keep her close.

40:39.703 --> 40:41.772
Either that or I lose her again.

41:56.413 --> 41:57.515
Are you going to visit her?

42:03.988 --> 42:05.322
I'm not used to wearing it.

42:15.599 --> 42:16.600
You're very handsome.

42:18.102 --> 42:19.069
Thank you.

44:03.841 --> 44:05.109
Did they treat you well?

44:09.446 --> 44:10.914
Are you my lawyer?

44:10.981 --> 44:11.949
No.

44:13.183 --> 44:15.085
But I'm trying to get you one.

44:15.786 --> 44:17.454
Are you going to tell me
what to do

44:17.521 --> 44:18.789
in order to get something here?

44:21.058 --> 44:23.327
If you're not my lawyer,
who are you?

44:31.869 --> 44:32.870
It's you!

44:36.040 --> 44:37.408
What are you doing?
Don't touch me!

44:39.009 --> 44:40.277
Why is she handcuffed?

44:40.344 --> 44:42.179
Take them off now!
Why the handcuffs?

44:42.246 --> 44:43.414
-Calm down.
-Take them off!

44:43.480 --> 44:44.448
Calm down.

44:46.450 --> 44:48.118
Sofia, my dear daughter.

44:49.853 --> 44:51.855
-What have they done to you?
-What is going on here?

44:52.623 --> 44:53.590
Who is Sofia?

44:56.927 --> 44:57.861
Who is Sofia?
