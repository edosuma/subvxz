00:27.110 --> 00:29.204
<i>The world we live in.</i>

00:30.322 --> 00:33.201
<i>It's so wondrous, mysterious,</i>

00:33.617 --> 00:35.995
<i>even magical.</i>

00:36.286 --> 00:39.085
<i>No. No, not that world.</i>

00:39.289 --> 00:41.917
<i>I meant this one.</i>

00:42.251 --> 00:43.798
<i>The smartphone.</i>

00:44.127 --> 00:49.099
<i>Each system and program and app is its
own little planet of perfect technology,</i>

00:49.466 --> 00:54.597
<i>all providing services so necessary,</i>
<i>so crucial, so unbelievably profound.</i>

00:55.514 --> 00:57.266
Look who just sent me a text.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.350
Addie McAllister?

00:58.642 --> 01:01.145
Must be a mistake. Or a joke. Or a scam.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.650
Don't send her your Social Security number.

01:02.771 --> 01:03.863
Dude.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.736
She's right there.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.989
<i>That's our user, Alex.</i>

01:08.360 --> 01:10.112
<i>And, like every freshman in high school,</i>

01:10.195 --> 01:14.291
<i>his whole life, everything,</i>
<i>revolves around his phone.</i>

01:19.496 --> 01:22.920
<i>And, as the pace of life</i>
<i>gets faster and faster...</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:24.627
Phones down in five.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.088
<i>And attention spans</i>
<i>get shorter and shorter and...</i>

01:27.170 --> 01:29.173
<i>You're probably not even</i>
<i>listening to me right now.</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:32.681
<i>Who has the time to type out actual words?</i>

01:32.926 --> 01:34.723
<i>And that's where we come in,</i>

01:34.803 --> 01:37.682
<i>the most important invention</i>
<i>in the history of communication...</i>

01:41.059 --> 01:42.561
<i>Emojis.</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:44.738
<i>That's my home.</i>

01:45.355 --> 01:46.732
<i>Textopolis.</i>

01:49.359 --> 01:51.407
<i>Here, each of us does one thing,</i>

01:51.528 --> 01:53.872
<i>and we have to nail it every time.</i>

01:54.531 --> 01:57.876
<i>The Christmas Tree</i>
<i>just has to stand there all festive.</i>

01:58.035 --> 01:59.287
Merry Christmas.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.121
It's still September, Tim.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.043
- <i>The Princesses...</i>
- I am so pretty.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.626
<i>They just got to wear their crowns</i>
<i>and keep their hair combed.</i>

02:05.709 --> 02:07.211
You guys, we are so pretty.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.385
<i>Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up.</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:13.183
<i>They just show up, and they're good to go.</i>

02:13.800 --> 02:16.804
<i>But for the faces, the pressure is on.</i>

02:16.887 --> 02:19.726
<i>Crier always has to cry,</i>
<i>even if he's just won the lottery.</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:22.479
Hooray! I'm a billionaire!

02:22.559 --> 02:24.273
<i>The Laugher is always laughing,</i>

02:24.353 --> 02:26.105
<i>even if he's just broken his arm.</i>

02:26.605 --> 02:28.357
I can see the bone!

02:30.400 --> 02:32.653
<i>Now, me, I'm a Meh.</i>

02:32.736 --> 02:36.702
<i>So I got to be totally over it all the time,</i>
<i>you know, like, "Meh, who cares?"</i>

02:36.782 --> 02:38.659
<i>Which is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

02:38.742 --> 02:40.038
<i>I gotta be</i>

02:40.118 --> 02:41.495
<i>Meh</i>

02:41.578 --> 02:43.080
<i>I gotta be</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:44.582
<i>Meh</i>

02:52.214 --> 02:55.263
Morning, Mrs. D.
I see you have the little minis with you.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.970
They're so cute.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.694
That is so adorable, I can't take it!

03:12.984 --> 03:14.907
Now I'll never get them to sleep.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.780
Stick to your one face, weirdo.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.953
No! No!

03:20.033 --> 03:22.582
<i>It's hard to always act blasé,</i>

03:22.786 --> 03:25.834
<i>when living in Textopolis
is just so exciting.</i>

03:25.914 --> 03:27.377
Hello, good simians.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.710
Those are some sharp attachés.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.008
Yes, well, we have business to attend to.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.632
- What kind of business?
- Monkey business.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.723
I sounded British.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.646
Meh. That was really good.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.187
Meh. Meh. That was a great...

03:45.267 --> 03:46.938
- Whatcha doing there, mate?
- Practicing.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.895
Today is my first day on the phone.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.357
Boy. I'm gonna be so meh.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.067
What are you gonna do?

03:53.150 --> 03:55.904
Me and the boys
are gonna throw ourselves on the barbie!

03:56.111 --> 03:57.658
Here's my sauce now.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.036
G'day, mate.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.495
Hey <i>. Konnichiwa.</i>

04:05.620 --> 04:07.463
Sorry, emoticons.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.175
I hate knocking over the elderly.
Here, let me help, let me help.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.173
My colon!

04:15.046 --> 04:17.925
- Is that the time?
- Hey, my eyes are up here, pal.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.680
Yeah! All right!

04:31.313 --> 04:32.815
Right on time.

04:36.568 --> 04:40.163
So, last week,
Alex sends me next to this guy.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.368
That kid. Where does he get this stuff?

04:48.997 --> 04:51.375
Why are you laughing, freak?

04:54.252 --> 04:57.631
<i>Now, unlike me, my parents are total pros.</i>

04:58.089 --> 05:00.683
Gene, please tell me
you weren't laughing just now.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.098
In public.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.768
He was. I remember.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.145
Let's go somewhere more private.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.942
I have some bad news, Gene.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.652
And I'm afraid you'll have
the wrong reaction.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.235
Okay. What's the wrong reaction?

05:18.568 --> 05:20.696
Anything other than "meh."

05:22.447 --> 05:23.744
Come on. I don't want to be late.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.617
I'm not letting you go to work today.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.953
- Wait, what?
- You're just not ready, son.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.415
Come on! Working in the cube
is an emoji's whole purpose in life.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.921
Everybody my age is working
on the phone except for me.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.130
Sweetie, that's not true.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.678
Yeah! I'm gonna work on the phone,
and I'm only 10.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.102
That's because I believe in you.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.933
Should we wash our hands?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.562
No, no, no.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.651
We're number two! We're number two!
We're number two!

05:55.438 --> 05:56.690
See?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.902
I know I'm different, okay?

06:01.278 --> 06:04.032
But when I need to, I can be meh.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.200
I just...

06:06.533 --> 06:08.752
I want to be a working emoji,
you know, like...

06:08.994 --> 06:10.792
Like everybody else, and then...

06:11.037 --> 06:13.005
Then I would finally fit in, you know?

06:13.415 --> 06:15.088
You fit in, honey.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.002
No, I don't, Mom.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.632
I never have.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.885
But I can change all that if you'd
just let me. Just give me a chance.

06:21.965 --> 06:25.390
But what if you get sent out on the phone,
making the wrong face?

06:25.677 --> 06:27.395
No, Dad, I'll make the right face.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.973
Look.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.141
Meh...

06:31.308 --> 06:33.561
You're so handsome when you make that face.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.357
I think he's ready, Mel.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.526
Meh.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.658
Come on, Dad.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.619
Let me prove it to you.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.408
If you really think you're ready.

06:45.488 --> 06:49.163
I am! Yes! Yes.
I promise, I won't let you down.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.378
Stop.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.804
Congratulations, everyone!

07:05.884 --> 07:08.729
What an exciting day for all of you.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.227
It's really her. Pizza.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.653
- Hey.
- Your first day on the job.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.321
Hi. Hi.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.867
Don't be nervous.
I won't bite. Hi. I'm Smiler.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.613
Don't touch me.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.739
- Hi!
- Okay.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.196
I mean, hey.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.744
As you know, I'm Smiler.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.163
I am the system supervisor here

07:32.243 --> 07:34.621
because I was the original emoji.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.047
Here's how it works.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.345
It's nothing fancy.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.882
Wait a minute. It's really fancy.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.766
You each have your own cube on the emoji bar.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.725
If Alex chooses you,

07:55.809 --> 07:59.029
should you be so lucky,
your cube will light up.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.323
It's showtime.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.406
The scanner will scan you,

08:07.237 --> 08:11.959
and that scan will get sent
right up to Alex's text box.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.710
And let me tell you, guys,

08:14.202 --> 08:18.298
there is nothing like getting scanned
for the first time.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.052
You're gonna love it. Really.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.634
Now, over here is the favorites section

08:25.714 --> 08:29.389
where you'll find
all the most popular emojis.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.721
And, of course, you'll find my cube here.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.892
You are smooth.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.394
Just doing my duty.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.895
What? What did I say?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.735
Rocket looking to party.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.364
Come on, tell me you aren't
just a little bit tempted.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.118
Steven, for the last time,
I don't want to buy a time-share.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.118
Come on, man, it's Hi-5.
You know me, I'm a favorite.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.661
Alex hasn't picked you in weeks.

08:55.744 --> 08:58.083
And if he stops picking you,
you're no longer a favorite.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.665
It's got to be some sort of mistake.

08:59.748 --> 09:03.048
I mean, look at me, I'm an attractive hand
giving a high five.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.466
- Fist Bump. Come on in.
- Hey.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.219
- Ladies.
- Fist Bump? He's a knucklehead. Literally.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.176
Look at him. I can look like that.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.891
Cramp. Huge mistake.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.354
Help. Help me. Help up the hand.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.902
- There you go.
- Thanks, mate.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.402
Hey, little Meh, how about
you create a distraction,

09:24.564 --> 09:26.237
and then I'll just slip under the rope?

09:27.108 --> 09:28.701
Is someone lost?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.824
Smiler, hi. Just leaving.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.077
Yeah, you know, just killing time

09:33.239 --> 09:35.742
before I go back to my cube in the far corner

09:35.825 --> 09:38.499
where Alex can't even see me anymore!

09:38.787 --> 09:40.664
You may not be a favorite anymore,

09:40.830 --> 09:43.675
but you will always have a place in the cube.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.339
Yeah, in the nosebleeds.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.843
I'm standing right here. Words hurt.

09:49.005 --> 09:53.181
The most important thing
I can tell you is to just be yourself.

09:54.886 --> 09:58.516
I was made to be happy,
so I am always smiling.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.730
<i>Places, please. Emojis to your cubes.</i>

10:02.352 --> 10:04.605
<i>Attention. We've got incoming.</i>

10:05.355 --> 10:06.982
Got to be meh. Got to be meh.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.863
Oh, my gosh, my own cube.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.912
I can't believe it.
I could put a plant over here.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.578
And over here could go
an inspirational calendar.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.452
Okay. Got to be meh. Got to be meh.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.378
Look at our son down there.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.047
I'm just beaming

10:24.207 --> 10:25.550
with pride.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.676
You don't think he'll actually get picked,
do you?

10:32.215 --> 10:34.058
Hie-ro-gly-phics.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.562
Hieroglyphics was an ancient language
of picture forms.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.935
Does that remind anyone of anything?

10:40.849 --> 10:45.104
Hello? A language of pictures. Anyone?

10:46.229 --> 10:50.530
Early hieroglyphs date back
as far as 3,300...

10:50.692 --> 10:52.490
I got to reply to Addie's text.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.571
- What should I write?
- Nothing.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.661
- Nothing?
- Words aren't cool.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.744
Okay. Be cool. Be cool.

11:02.579 --> 11:05.378
All right,
Alex is not sure how he wants to play this.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.922
I would really love it to be me.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.844
Beam me up! Beam me up!

11:10.295 --> 11:11.763
I need Thumbs Up on standby.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.549
Yeah! Thumbs Up is going in!

11:16.301 --> 11:18.269
<i>Wait! Alex is changing his mind.</i>

11:20.471 --> 11:21.893
He's moving.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.979
Okay. Looks like it's gonna be Meh.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.119
I'm so nervous, I could almost shrug.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.950
We are go for Meh.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.407
Initiating scan.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.700
Okay. You can do this.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.628
- I can't do this! I can't do it!
- What is this?

11:46.080 --> 11:48.674
- Stop the scan!
- I can't! It's too late!

11:50.793 --> 11:53.591
Meh, meh, meh, meh.
My goodness, I'm freaking out!

11:53.671 --> 11:56.095
- What's he doing?
- He's making the wrong face!

11:56.216 --> 11:58.935
Good for him! Little... Wait, what?

11:59.093 --> 12:01.061
Be meh! Be meh! Be meh!

12:01.387 --> 12:02.605
Abort! Abort!

12:03.806 --> 12:05.399
Shut it down! Shut it down!

12:13.650 --> 12:14.902
What is that emoji?

12:15.109 --> 12:17.612
Wrong emoji sent! Evacuate the Meh cube!

12:20.949 --> 12:23.577
- <i>Evacuate the cube!</i>
- I got to get out of here.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.793
<i>Get that bozo out of there!</i>

12:28.873 --> 12:30.250
I'm trying!

12:42.220 --> 12:45.690
No!

12:46.516 --> 12:47.608
Oh, my God.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.576
The humanity.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.116
Medic.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.660
Sorry, everybody.
That was not what I meant to do.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.039
I kinda...

13:06.452 --> 13:07.579
I kinda panicked.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.710
Are you even a Meh at all?

13:10.540 --> 13:11.917
- Who? Me?
- Course he is.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.418
He's my spitting image.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.924
If you have expressions other than meh,

13:16.546 --> 13:19.015
what you are is a malfunction.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.100
Malfunction?

13:26.347 --> 13:29.396
No! I can be meh.
Just give me one more chance.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.438
That's not gonna happen.

13:33.021 --> 13:36.196
You know what would be really fun?
A board meeting.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.572
Where we could figure out
what to do with you!

13:43.865 --> 13:46.368
- I knew there was something wrong with him.
- A malfunction?

13:46.743 --> 13:48.581
- What's gonna happen to him?
- He can't work on the phone.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.913
What would Alex think?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.964
- That's the guy.
- What do his parents think?

14:07.513 --> 14:10.813
I just wanted to be useful, you know? Fit in.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.320
Now everybody thinks I'm a malfunction.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.568
I am a malfunction.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.955
Even if you are a malfunction, Gene,

14:24.322 --> 14:26.916
your mom and dad still love you.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.830
I knew you weren't ready.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.371
Let's get you out of here and take you home.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.965
One day, all this will blow over,

14:34.207 --> 14:37.711
and everyone will almost forget
about what you did.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.674
Until then,

14:39.754 --> 14:42.257
you should probably stay
locked up in the apartment.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.309
Wait. You want to hide me away?

14:46.260 --> 14:47.557
You're embarrassed of me.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.559
It's for your own safety.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.733
We're trying to protect you, son.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.154
Gene? Where are you going?

14:56.604 --> 14:57.856
I'm not gonna run away from this.

14:57.939 --> 15:01.660
I'm an emoji, and even though
I'm not sure exactly which one,

15:03.111 --> 15:05.489
I've got to have some sort of purpose here.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.032
I know it.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.954
Gene, no.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.328
Sweetie, please.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.292
Boy.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.173
- A malfunction...
- Order! Order!

15:20.253 --> 15:21.800
The motion is carried.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.966
So, how'd it go, Gavel?

15:25.967 --> 15:28.220
Hey, Light Bulb,
tell me what's going on in there.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.435
What? Poop, what is it?

15:31.681 --> 15:33.770
Tell me, turd. Tell me true. What happened?

15:33.850 --> 15:37.690
I know it was an accident.
We all have accidents.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.317
You're so soft, Poop.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.024
Not too soft, I hope.

15:42.191 --> 15:45.195
Gene!
We were just gonna come looking for you.

15:45.820 --> 15:50.701
Why don't you come inside the boardroom,
and we can have a teeny, weeny chat.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.431
I came up here to defend myself,
but you seem pretty happy.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.974
So, good news?

16:07.967 --> 16:10.265
Right. I'm always happy.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.479
Right. Hashtag truth.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.851
Well, the only thing
that could ever make me unhappy

16:16.225 --> 16:19.149
is if one of our emoji team made a mistake,

16:19.896 --> 16:23.366
which caused Alex to lose faith in the phone.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.829
And then our whole world gets wiped out.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.584
Smiler, I double-pinky-swear promise to you

16:33.868 --> 16:37.122
that I will never, ever
make a mistake in the cube again.

16:37.788 --> 16:41.543
We know you won't, Gene. We know you won't.

16:43.085 --> 16:47.677
You know, the first time you said it,
it sounded genuine, but then you repeated it,

16:47.757 --> 16:49.178
and then, that was weird.

16:49.258 --> 16:53.479
That's because we're setting you up
with our best Anti-Virus Bots.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.569
So, they'll like... They'll just...
They're gonna fix me?

16:59.936 --> 17:02.485
Actually, delete you. But yes!

17:02.897 --> 17:04.819
- Wait, what?
- If you get deleted,

17:05.107 --> 17:07.030
you don't have to worry about

17:07.734 --> 17:10.784
what your purpose is or the future

17:11.113 --> 17:13.491
or why you're such a malfunction.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.873
'Cause you're deleted, right?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.377
All right, good talk.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.789
Bots!

17:23.000 --> 17:24.297
No!

17:27.797 --> 17:29.219
Don't let him escape!

17:44.313 --> 17:46.361
Party time! Wait a minute...

18:02.456 --> 18:04.709
The air is better here.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.056
- Beer, Tea.
- I'm Coffee!

18:10.214 --> 18:12.512
Sorry. Sheesh. So edgy.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.313
My old cube.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.978
Take a hike, Mike.

18:24.478 --> 18:27.276
My name's not Mike. What?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.278
- There's AV Bots coming!
- For me?

18:29.358 --> 18:31.031
Just because I'm in the wrong section?

18:34.030 --> 18:35.623
Holy deleto!

18:41.871 --> 18:44.169
- What do we do?
- Quick! This way!

18:49.295 --> 18:50.547
Let's go.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.018
Don't tell anyone you're about to see this.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.230
They'll never find us down here.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.562
Where are we? The basement?

19:06.228 --> 19:09.152
No. Welcome to the Loser Lounge,

19:09.565 --> 19:12.990
where the emojis who never get used hang out.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.574
Go fish, Fish Cake With Swirl.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.921
Sweep so you won't cry.
Sweep so you won't cry.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.460
Sweep so you won't cry.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.336
I almost got deleted.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.380
Me, Hi-5.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.136
Hey. What's up, Hi-5?

19:34.340 --> 19:37.469
They weren't trying to delete you.
They were trying to delete me.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.355
You? What's so important about you
they'd send out an entire team of Bots?

19:41.639 --> 19:43.607
They say I'm a malfunction.

19:43.766 --> 19:44.984
What?

19:46.435 --> 19:49.405
You bringing malfunctions in here now, Hi-5?

19:50.606 --> 19:52.779
For crying out loud, Abandoned Luggage,

19:52.900 --> 19:55.449
that had better not be
my leftover Chinese food.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.781
What Chinese food?

20:01.992 --> 20:05.667
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be living large, hashtag blessed,

20:05.830 --> 20:10.836
the favorite of the favorites,
and then demoted to this pit of despair?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.384
Here, will you hit my calluses for me?

20:13.754 --> 20:15.301
At least you're a working emoji.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.261
That's all I ever wanted.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.305
Well, if that's all it'll take

20:19.385 --> 20:22.764
for you to be satisfied, then just find
a hacker and get reprogrammed.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.140
It's not that complicated.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.691
Where would I find a hacker?

20:25.850 --> 20:27.318
In the Piracy app.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.857
Who took my clear nail polish?

20:32.648 --> 20:33.649
Piracy app?

20:33.733 --> 20:36.487
To get there, I mean,
I'd have to leave Textopolis.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.830
So? I've done it. Would you be a brother?

20:39.739 --> 20:42.242
One of the Princess emojis
left the phone altogether.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.667
Now she lives on the cloud.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.337
That is good.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.458
I'm sure the hacker that helped her do that
could easily reprogram you.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.417
- The name's Jailbreak.
- Jailbreak?

20:51.959 --> 20:54.006
That's great! Reprogrammed.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.424
I just need to be reprogrammed,

20:55.504 --> 20:58.974
and then, I can finally be
the Meh I was meh to be.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.514
Help me find that hacker, Hi-5.
Will you? Please?

21:01.844 --> 21:03.687
Maybe this hacker could help you, too.

21:03.888 --> 21:07.438
Like rewrite some code,
get you into the favorites section.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.815
Wait a minute.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.979
I've been trying to use my charisma

21:12.062 --> 21:14.360
and sense of entitlement
to get me back on top,

21:14.440 --> 21:15.903
but all I need is a hacker.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.611
Today's your lucky day. Let's roll.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.075
Hey, can I come, too?

21:21.155 --> 21:22.907
Talk to the hand, Red Wagon.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.702
I thought I was.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.504
Bye, Felicia.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.420
Ciao, Fish Cake with Swirl.

21:32.500 --> 21:36.841
Daddy's heading back
to the VIPs where he belongs!

21:36.921 --> 21:38.594
Wait. What about the Bots?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.509
Good point. Good point.

21:59.902 --> 22:00.949
Hey.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.413
I shouldn't have picked the cactus.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.409
- I just... I shouldn't have picked it.
- You didn't even try to get the tree.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.118
It's baffling. Let's go.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.884
Hi-5?

22:16.168 --> 22:17.340
Hello?

22:19.088 --> 22:20.306
Hi-5?

22:21.924 --> 22:24.222
- Where are you?
- I'm right here!

22:24.927 --> 22:27.976
Gene! Here we are, end of the text app.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.027
No way.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.563
Come on, Gene. It's perfectly safe.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.359
- No!
- Gene, help me!

22:37.439 --> 22:39.528
- The wallpaper monster's got me!
- No! Hold on, hold on!

22:39.608 --> 22:40.821
Hi-5!

22:40.901 --> 22:44.531
No. This is all my fault! I'm so sorry, Hi-5!
I'm...

22:44.613 --> 22:46.331
I'm just messing with you.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.367
It's one of those
rubber finger-monster puppets

22:48.450 --> 22:50.919
from the '80s. I collected the whole set.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.459
All right, you coming?

22:53.455 --> 22:54.752
- What do I do?
- What do you mean?

22:54.832 --> 22:56.550
Just take a step through the other side.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.050
This is it.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.973
The next time I come back here,

23:03.924 --> 23:05.642
I'll be a real Meh.

23:09.763 --> 23:10.855
Hi-5?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.326
No!

23:27.948 --> 23:29.291
Are you finished?

23:31.827 --> 23:33.454
Where are we?

23:33.537 --> 23:36.541
Welcome to the Wallpaper.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.683
This place is incredible.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.062
Each app is its own unique world.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.894
That's my face. You're on my... Thank you.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.820
What is this place?

23:58.979 --> 24:00.197
WeChat.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.030
It's like a whole other world.

24:07.863 --> 24:08.990
It is.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.082
What are they?

24:15.162 --> 24:18.382
They're Bubble Pups. They might be cute,
but, man, are they clingy.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.677
- Bubble Pups?
- They're stickers, Gene.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.387
Try to get with the program.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.468
This is so cool.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.387
Wait. What's in that one?

24:28.592 --> 24:31.515
- Guys, look at this picture. Look at my baby.
- This is what I ate for breakfast.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.017
- This is what I ate for lunch!
- Here's me on a hike!

24:33.097 --> 24:34.599
Here's me in the gym!
Here's me in the bathroom!

24:34.682 --> 24:36.776
Everybody's talking about themselves.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.522
How does he know so many people?

24:38.602 --> 24:41.481
None of these people know him,
but they like him,

24:41.563 --> 24:44.533
and that's what matters
in this life, popularity.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.577
I think I'd...

24:47.695 --> 24:49.698
I think I'd rather just have a real friend.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.249
A real friend?
How's that gonna get you anywhere?

24:52.408 --> 24:54.581
What you need are fans.

24:54.910 --> 24:58.289
They give you complete
and unrelenting support.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.249
As long as you're on top.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.633
Poor Gene. I blame myself.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.422
I blame you, too.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.595
I just wanted to be supportive.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.476
You just wanted a vacation.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.806
You take that back, Mel Meh.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.480
Bots.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.855
If they haven't found Gene by now,
he must have skipped town.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.315
You mean the Wallpaper?

25:24.440 --> 25:26.033
Our boy's on the run.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.943
How about we find him ourselves?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.740
Yeah, for sure.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.372
Tell all Bots to follow those Mehs.

25:39.705 --> 25:43.879
I'm sure they'll know all the
freaky-deaky apps Gene will hide out in.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.506
I'm really good at making plans, you guys.

25:46.128 --> 25:47.175
Right?

25:48.422 --> 25:50.550
Here we are. The Piracy app.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.767
This is where we'll find Jailbreak.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.729
But this is the Dictionary.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.190
That's just what Alex
wants his parents to think.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.900
This is called a skin.

26:00.017 --> 26:03.942
Really? What could a teenage boy
possibly want to hide from his parents?

26:05.606 --> 26:08.325
Just try to keep up.
This place can get a little rough.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.911
Ahoy, mateys.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.788
Look who's back!

26:21.038 --> 26:22.210
Hi-5!

26:22.414 --> 26:24.667
I'm a bit of a celebrity here.
Always welcome.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.297
Loser!

26:26.585 --> 26:28.132
Come on. Follow me.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.512
Great. Emojis.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.272
I thought the conversation just got dumber.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.563
Internet trolls. Just ignore them.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.522
Eventually, they'll get a job or a girlfriend

26:43.602 --> 26:46.356
or some sort of purpose in life,
and they'll stop.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.618
Virus. We'll just...
We'll just walk over this way.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.577
- Hi! It's so great to see you again.
- Do I know you?

26:59.660 --> 27:02.958
It's Spam. Just sign here and I can get you
special discounts on vitamins

27:03.038 --> 27:04.710
and credit card offers
that can save you up to 25%.

27:04.790 --> 27:07.463
- 25%?
- No, no, no, don't get sucked in.

27:07.543 --> 27:08.839
Back off, Spam!

27:08.919 --> 27:10.632
It's the only way to deal... Back off!

27:10.712 --> 27:12.176
Thank you very much!

27:12.256 --> 27:15.135
You can illegally download our CD right here.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.561
Hey, Trojan Horse. How are you?

27:17.803 --> 27:19.349
Yeah, what'll it be, hand?

27:19.429 --> 27:22.729
I'll have a bottle of "Hack Daniel's."

27:24.643 --> 27:27.567
Maybe with a plate of cheese and hackers?

27:28.397 --> 27:30.491
- <i>Capisce?</i>
- You trying to find a hacker?

27:30.649 --> 27:33.403
- You can just ask, you know.
- Sorry. Yes.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.283
We're looking for a hacker named Jailbreak.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.406
I know a guy that can hook you up.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.252
Right over there.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.710
He looks capable.

27:46.206 --> 27:48.834
No, not him. Her.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.924
Wait. He's a she?

27:52.921 --> 27:54.343
Hey, Jailbreak.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.345
- Mind if we join you?
- Yes.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.763
That's the thing about
the Internet, isn't it?

27:57.843 --> 28:00.267
You can never tell if someone's
being ironic or sincere.

28:00.554 --> 28:03.353
I sincerely, unironically
want you to go away.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.357
That's a good one.

28:08.270 --> 28:11.110
So, here's the thing.
My friend Gene here has a little problem.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.693
Well, see, I'm supposed to be a Meh,

28:13.775 --> 28:15.572
- but I don't really feel...
- Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:15.652 --> 28:18.656
No, that's good. And we thought
you could help, since you got the Princess,

28:18.739 --> 28:20.787
- you know, off the phone.
- Not interested.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.836
Hold up. That's not a Meh face.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.591
Bots! They're after me!

28:37.174 --> 28:38.387
How are you doing that?

28:38.467 --> 28:40.595
Look, it's just something I can do.
Can you help us?

28:43.972 --> 28:44.973
Follow me.

28:49.019 --> 28:50.396
Bots! Delete my history!

28:53.273 --> 28:55.742
I corrupted the entire hard drive.

28:56.360 --> 28:59.284
I made the most delicious cinnamon buns.

29:01.823 --> 29:05.293
Maybe if there was something
to, you know, jog my memory.

29:09.331 --> 29:10.924
Come on! Move!

29:11.917 --> 29:15.387
Hey, Trolls, why is that mailbox
wearing a tuxedo?

29:21.510 --> 29:24.059
Hi! It's so great to see you again! Call me!

29:31.520 --> 29:33.067
This tunnel will get us out of here.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.280
Move!

29:58.714 --> 30:00.637
Did that cloud taste sweet to you?

30:07.472 --> 30:09.224
Help me! Help! I'm stuck!

30:09.766 --> 30:12.394
- Sweet motherboard!
- Where am I?

30:16.064 --> 30:18.317
- Get me out of here.
- Hey, Palm Face.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.949
- Try getting him out the top!
- Already on it!

30:21.069 --> 30:22.446
Hold tight, Gene.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.876
This feels very odd, and it smells.

30:32.956 --> 30:36.460
I mean, it smells good, it smells delicious,
but I still don't like it.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.840
The game obviously thinks you're a candy,

30:38.920 --> 30:42.095
even though you're weirdly misshapen,
you know?

30:42.466 --> 30:43.763
What are we gonna do?

30:43.925 --> 30:45.514
Stay very still.

30:45.594 --> 30:49.144
Don't worry. We've got your back.
Right, Hi-5?

30:49.973 --> 30:52.521
Hey, Fingers! You want to focus?

30:52.601 --> 30:54.773
For your information, I happen
to have a sugar addiction,

30:54.853 --> 30:57.322
- and it's a very serious...
- Listen, Finger Head!

30:57.731 --> 31:01.154
We have to get Gene out of the game
without blowing him up.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.197
I don't want to blow up.

31:02.277 --> 31:05.575
We have to match up the candies,
so that Gene will drop to the bottom.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.704
And we can't match him
with any yellows, or else...

31:09.993 --> 31:11.290
Don't do that. Please don't do that.

31:11.453 --> 31:12.625
Watch.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.129
- You got it?
- Match three in a row.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.630
Don't blow Gene up. Got it.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.462
And we have to be very careful.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.048
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Careful. Candy!

31:25.675 --> 31:27.018
- Watch it!
- Hey!

31:27.594 --> 31:29.141
No! No, no, no! Slow down.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.014
Not the yellows! Not the yellows.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.811
I said careful!

31:39.398 --> 31:43.449
My mom just joined Facebook.
Can you believe she wanted to friend me?

31:44.736 --> 31:48.327
Hey, Addie, I was
just wondering if you are...

31:48.407 --> 31:49.625
- <i>Tasty.</i>
- What?

31:49.866 --> 31:52.039
- <i>Delicious.</i>
- Excuse me?

31:52.119 --> 31:53.120
<i>Sweet.</i>

31:53.203 --> 31:54.705
- Hey, Addie!
- Hi, Nikki.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.753
- No!
- See you later, Alex.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.751
<i>Sugar Crush.</i>

31:59.084 --> 32:00.381
So over this.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.596
<i>Wireless Wireless. How may I help you?</i>

32:07.676 --> 32:09.178
I'd like to make an appointment.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.013
It's like this phone
is playing games with me.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.517
Hey, what does this do?

32:20.063 --> 32:21.315
No!

32:22.107 --> 32:23.359
Get me out of here!

32:28.530 --> 32:31.409
- Suck it in!
- No! Stop it! Stop, stop!

32:32.033 --> 32:35.003
- It's not working.
- Well, there's one option left.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.081
We line you up with the yellows.

32:37.372 --> 32:38.590
But you said not to do that.

32:38.748 --> 32:41.046
Special candies get transported to that jar.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.595
The game might think you're a special candy.

32:43.879 --> 32:47.224
And what if it doesn't think
I'm a special candy?

32:47.340 --> 32:48.592
Well...

32:59.352 --> 33:01.946
- Jailbreak, hello? Hello, Jailbreak?
- Sorry.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.073
What if it doesn't think I'm a special candy?

33:04.774 --> 33:06.651
I'm not too worried about it.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.489
Okay, just do it.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.372
Gene!

33:19.456 --> 33:22.585
- Gene?
- Hey. No!

33:23.251 --> 33:25.424
Gene! You're alive!

33:26.963 --> 33:30.512
You were trying to see if I had somehow
turned into candy, weren't you?

33:30.592 --> 33:32.640
Yes, I was. And you have not.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.309
Hey. Looks like something popped up
on Alex's calendar.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.104
I'm sure it's nothing.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.158
Alex made an appointment at the phone store.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.448
No!

33:50.946 --> 33:52.949
Calm down, everyone!

33:53.073 --> 33:54.416
Calm down.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.960
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.629
Maybe Alex just wants
to buy some accessories.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.336
His appointment is with technical support.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.922
Well, I'm sure we still have plenty of time
to figure this out.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.636
His appointment is for tomorrow.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.596
Then maybe it's just
for some routine maintenance.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.648
Actually, it's to erase the phone.

34:25.647 --> 34:29.571
Listen, Gene, I'm about to become
your knight in shining armor.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.244
- You are?
- Yeah.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.456
But first,
we need to get uploaded to the cloud.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.827
That's where we'll find the source code
to reprogram you.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.502
The cloud?

34:39.661 --> 34:41.163
Isn't that off the phone?

34:41.371 --> 34:43.089
Ding, ding, ding, ding. You got it.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.668
Yeah, the cloud. Off the phone.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.754
We're in <i>Candy Crush,</i> obvs.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.340
I know a shortcut to <i>Just Dance,</i>

34:51.422 --> 34:53.094
which is right next to Dropbox,

34:53.174 --> 34:55.177
where we can get uploaded to the cloud.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.849
Of course.
<i>Just Dance,</i> then boogie over to Dropbox,

34:57.929 --> 34:59.306
catch the link, and zoom.

34:59.389 --> 35:00.810
Hold up. Here's the stinker.

35:00.890 --> 35:04.565
Before they let us into the cloud,
we have to get past this firewall.

35:06.354 --> 35:09.653
- The firewall uses face identification.
- Yeah, the firewall.

35:09.733 --> 35:12.072
Which is really annoying,
because I've already tried to get through.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.449
Guessed wrong once,
and now I'm locked out for life.

35:14.529 --> 35:15.621
Locked out for life?

35:15.822 --> 35:18.746
You're thinking,
'cause I can make different faces,

35:19.034 --> 35:21.378
- the firewall will think I'm different emojis.
- Yeah.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.880
I wanted to say it 'cause it was my idea.

35:23.997 --> 35:25.749
You know, women are always
coming up with stuff

35:25.832 --> 35:27.003
that men are taking credit for.

35:27.083 --> 35:30.087
- You know what...
- Well, then let's hit the road.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.508
Hi-5, you coming?

35:31.588 --> 35:33.215
I'm coming!

35:34.716 --> 35:37.595
Why do I always think
I'm gonna come around on black licorice?

35:39.679 --> 35:40.806
My precious.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.185
Hey! Move it!

35:42.265 --> 35:43.983
Certain death, here we come.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.988
Let's try this one.

35:49.731 --> 35:51.199
YouTube?

35:56.613 --> 35:58.581
What a visual treat.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.916
And I don't even need a remote.

36:04.037 --> 36:06.085
That guy is so expressive.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.550
He reminds me of Gene.

36:08.792 --> 36:11.466
Yeah. Something really wrong with him.

36:11.753 --> 36:14.381
- Mel.
- Our son is a malfunction,

36:14.923 --> 36:17.887
and you should never have
let him go into that cube.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.844
Don't blame me for this, Mel.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.022
I am hopping mad at you.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.348
See?

36:26.184 --> 36:28.437
Mary, I think we're being followed.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.480
But don't overreact.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.781
I told you not to overreact.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.416
What are you doing now?

36:45.912 --> 36:48.290
They'll be in there for hours.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.309
Mary, where are you going?

37:03.430 --> 37:05.808
I think we should go our separate ways, Mel.

37:06.015 --> 37:08.643
I thought I knew the Meh that I married,

37:08.810 --> 37:10.483
but maybe I don't.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.648
But, Mary...

37:16.025 --> 37:18.323
This tunnel will help us avoid the Bots.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.242
Thanks for helping us.
It's really nice of you.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.995
NBD, dude. The truth is, you're helping me.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.789
Come on, let's move it. Why so slow?

37:25.869 --> 37:29.209
Hi-5, stop. Why are you getting so close?
What's with you? Back off.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.007
Can't stop now. I'm having a sugar rush!

37:31.332 --> 37:34.461
I'll go around you.
If I stop moving, my heart's gonna explode!

37:34.586 --> 37:38.261
- Coming through, Jailbreak! Look out!
- Hey! Watch it, Knuckle Butt!

37:38.590 --> 37:39.842
I can't feel my face.

37:40.425 --> 37:43.304
So, Jailbreak,
back there you said I'm helping you.

37:43.470 --> 37:46.017
I've been trying to
get past that firewall for months.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.646
Come on, come on! The faster we get there,
the faster I become a favorite!

37:51.186 --> 37:52.688
Look at me!

37:52.812 --> 37:56.442
I just want to bounce out of here,
get off the phone, and live on the cloud.

38:01.654 --> 38:02.992
What just happened?

38:03.072 --> 38:04.915
You don't like it here?

38:05.158 --> 38:08.503
There's so many rules here.
What is up with that?

38:08.661 --> 38:10.208
The cloud is supposed to be amazing.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.915
There's so much to see and do.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.884
Sugar crash.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.214
I can't hold on anymore.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.887
Catch me, Gene. Catch me!

38:18.630 --> 38:20.803
And you can be whoever you want.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.975
- Thanks.
- You're free! Come on!

38:27.972 --> 38:30.066
Oh, my gosh, my hands are sweating.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.477
You are a hand!

38:34.479 --> 38:35.697
Yeah!

38:39.901 --> 38:42.154
You know, come to think of it,
I don't really remember

38:42.237 --> 38:44.410
there ever being a hacker emoji.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.538
You know,
you're taking up too much of my brain space.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.416
Let's keep the chitchat to a minimum.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.925
- Someone likes you.
- What are you talking about?

38:55.041 --> 38:58.011
This is just like when Peace Sign
gave me just one finger.

38:58.378 --> 38:59.721
I knew she was in love with me.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.256
Let's go!

39:02.006 --> 39:04.725
I'm never eating
another piece of candy ever again.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.764
Hi-5, don't do it.

39:09.722 --> 39:12.441
Don't you do it.
It's already been in there once.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.440
Don't do it.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.775
- Move it!
- Are my fingers getting fat?

39:19.899 --> 39:22.197
I'll tell you what,
this bandage wasn't so tight before.

39:27.240 --> 39:31.336
Okay. We get through this app,
and Dropbox is right on the other side.

39:31.452 --> 39:34.046
We just need to keep it super DL in here.

39:34.163 --> 39:37.633
And no matter what, we can't turn it on.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.304
OMG, this turned it on!

39:45.633 --> 39:48.512
What? I'm a hand. It's a big, red button.

40:02.609 --> 40:03.906
- What's happening?
- No, no, no, no, no!

40:05.445 --> 40:07.573
Welcome to <i>Just Dance!</i>

40:08.031 --> 40:11.080
Follow my moves and you get to move forward.

40:11.618 --> 40:14.463
Do the wrong moves and you get an "X."

40:15.038 --> 40:17.257
Three strikes and you're out.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.127
Out? What does she mean by "Out"?

40:20.501 --> 40:22.003
Digital death.

40:22.795 --> 40:25.890
Thanks to you, Fingers.
Now we're gonna have to dance our way out.

40:26.299 --> 40:29.428
Which is all right with me,
'cause I can shake it like Michael.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.016
Or Michael's glove, anyway.

40:31.137 --> 40:35.768
Are you ready to dance?

40:36.184 --> 40:39.529
This is bad, Gene. I can't dance.
I got no groove.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.731
Come on. Everybody can dance.

40:42.023 --> 40:45.152
Not me, okay? I'm really stiff.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.997
See? I can't... Don't understand.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.532
Okay. No, no.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.412
- Hey, no, stop, stop.
- Stop, stop. She has to stop.

40:52.492 --> 40:55.621
I see now what you are saying.
Just follow her moves.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.713
Ready to dance in three...

40:58.373 --> 40:59.591
This I can't do.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.501
- Two...
- Dude...

41:01.626 --> 41:03.503
- Just shut up and...
- Dance!

41:17.725 --> 41:20.399
It's too easy! Shamone!

41:35.076 --> 41:36.077
Jailbreak!

41:37.662 --> 41:39.039
I got you.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.586
Look. Just feel the music.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.919
- Express yourself.
- Through dance?

41:47.588 --> 41:49.260
Yeah, you got it! Go, girl!

41:49.340 --> 41:51.559
Now throw some sauce on that dance burrito.

41:53.594 --> 41:54.937
I'm doing it!

41:55.054 --> 41:57.398
I'm fully nailing this dance!

41:59.976 --> 42:01.398
You got it!

42:08.109 --> 42:11.363
Great job! You're moving on to free dance!

42:11.487 --> 42:14.707
Impress us with your moves to move forward.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.500
More dancing?

42:28.880 --> 42:31.508
You're killing it, Gene! Slay!

42:34.677 --> 42:37.806
Nice! Shake it, Gene. You won't break it.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.349
Wait a minute!

42:39.432 --> 42:41.646
I've never seen that dance before.

42:41.726 --> 42:42.773
What's it called?

42:44.270 --> 42:46.568
The Emoji Pop?

42:49.067 --> 42:51.864
I love it!

42:51.944 --> 42:53.617
What? You do?

42:56.741 --> 43:01.998
Everybody, do the Emoji Pop!

43:18.638 --> 43:20.015
Yes!

43:27.146 --> 43:28.819
Princess.

43:29.899 --> 43:31.492
You're the Princess emoji?

43:32.693 --> 43:33.820
You never got off the phone.

43:33.903 --> 43:36.031
Welcome, new players!

43:36.614 --> 43:37.702
- What?
- Who?

43:37.782 --> 43:38.954
No!

43:46.207 --> 43:47.925
- We got to go.
- Don't worry.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.295
They're robots. They can't dance.

43:50.711 --> 43:52.884
<i>Downloading funk protocol.</i>

44:01.013 --> 44:02.640
"Can't dance," he says.

44:10.189 --> 44:11.316
Move!

44:12.400 --> 44:15.239
<i>Congratulations. You're a disco diva.</i>

44:15.319 --> 44:17.367
Hey, Alex, you gonna dance for us?

44:18.406 --> 44:20.409
Alex, that's extra homework for you.

44:21.868 --> 44:23.461
Hey, Alex, you gonna shake it?

44:23.911 --> 44:25.584
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

44:29.500 --> 44:31.173
Alex must be deleting the app.

44:36.507 --> 44:37.884
Watch out!

44:42.555 --> 44:44.519
- No!
- We got to get out of here.

44:44.599 --> 44:45.942
Come on!

44:46.642 --> 44:47.980
This song is my jam.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.063
Hi-5, come on! Let's go!

44:57.111 --> 44:58.533
Hurry!

45:03.784 --> 45:05.331
- Hi-5!
- Gene!

45:06.454 --> 45:07.797
I got you!

45:12.543 --> 45:13.795
Gene...

45:14.462 --> 45:15.554
Hi-5!

45:32.146 --> 45:33.318
Gene.

45:35.650 --> 45:38.369
Hey, wait. Where's Hi-5?

45:39.195 --> 45:40.993
Alex trashed the app.

45:42.198 --> 45:43.996
And Hi-5 right along with it.

45:44.242 --> 45:45.994
Wait, what? Wait, trashed?

45:46.160 --> 45:47.503
Hi-5 is in the trash?

45:48.120 --> 45:49.497
He wanted to dance.

45:49.664 --> 45:52.167
But I knew it was a bad idea.

45:52.667 --> 45:54.886
- I'm so sorry.
- We got to get him out of there.

45:55.127 --> 45:59.223
Gene, Dropbox is right here.
That's our ticket to the cloud.

45:59.674 --> 46:02.013
And the trash is on
the other side of the phone.

46:02.093 --> 46:04.141
We don't know how many
other Bots are out there.

46:04.971 --> 46:08.020
- I'm sorry.
- No way. We can't go without Hi-5.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.147
I don't care how far away it is.

46:11.310 --> 46:13.233
- Gene.
- That's my friend down there.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.402
I'm not just gonna leave him to get deleted.

46:16.857 --> 46:18.154
What? What is it?

46:19.694 --> 46:23.073
I've always just thought
you got to look out for number one.

46:23.281 --> 46:26.205
Well, what good is it to be number one
if there aren't any other numbers?

46:29.453 --> 46:30.796
Okay.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.216
I'm sorry. This is my malfunction.

46:34.417 --> 46:36.966
I just... I can't be meh about anything.

46:37.169 --> 46:39.217
This is why I'm going to get reprogrammed.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.434
Well, it's actually kind of cool.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.561
Wait, really?

46:48.014 --> 46:50.563
You know, I think I know a shortcut.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.152
We can take the music streams in Spotify.

46:53.769 --> 46:55.646
Let's go give that big hand a hand.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.232
Come on.

47:08.242 --> 47:11.457
Alex trashed the <i>Just Dance</i> app,
and our Bots are offline,

47:11.537 --> 47:13.255
and it's giving me a real headache.

47:13.873 --> 47:15.591
I am so angry.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.756
I really need to stay happy.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.424
Can we please lighten the mood?

47:21.505 --> 47:23.849
No one can resist <i>una fiesta!</i>

47:26.677 --> 47:27.929
Not that happy.

47:30.139 --> 47:33.018
We've only got four hours
before Alex's phone appointment.

47:33.100 --> 47:36.695
If they find a malfunction on the phone,
we are all gonna be wiped.

47:37.313 --> 47:38.314
Yeah.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.483
She said, "Wiped."

47:41.776 --> 47:43.369
Aim higher, Steven.

47:43.527 --> 47:46.656
I didn't want to have to do this,
but it is fun to press buttons.

47:51.035 --> 47:52.287
The illegal upgrade.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.883
Now that makes me happy.

48:09.470 --> 48:11.097
I just want to dance.

48:11.180 --> 48:13.102
Dance, please.

48:13.182 --> 48:14.980
Quiet, you sassy gypsy.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.486
- Where am I?
- Hi! It's so great to see you again!

48:22.566 --> 48:24.905
You're in the trash, Fingers for Brains.

48:24.985 --> 48:26.737
- Get away from me, Troll.
- Hi!

48:26.821 --> 48:28.242
It's so great to see you again!

48:28.322 --> 48:30.161
- I got to get out of here.
- You can't.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.618
And at the end of the day,

48:31.700 --> 48:34.670
the trash gets emptied,
and we're all gonna die!

48:34.829 --> 48:36.206
No. No, no!

48:36.539 --> 48:39.088
This is the last face you will ever see.

48:40.167 --> 48:42.386
No!

48:57.059 --> 48:59.027
- This is Spotify?
- Yep.

48:59.186 --> 49:01.530
Every one of those streams
is a different song.

49:01.939 --> 49:03.361
Is it safe?

49:10.072 --> 49:11.073
Yeah!

49:13.868 --> 49:17.291
- Yeah!
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

49:17.371 --> 49:19.374
Fastest way to the trash, dude!

49:19.457 --> 49:22.336
Could we at least pick a calmer stream?

49:22.418 --> 49:24.045
Okay, buzzkill.

49:30.551 --> 49:33.224
Alex. A bunch of people
are hitting the promenade.

49:33.304 --> 49:36.143
- I think Addie might be there, too.
- That's perfect!

49:36.223 --> 49:39.146
I have an appointment down there, anyway.
I've got to get this phone fixed.

49:39.226 --> 49:40.478
<i>Bubble, bubble, bubble butt</i>

49:40.561 --> 49:42.734
- Hey, bubble butt.
- Yeah, you do.

49:46.066 --> 49:47.613
Much better.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.661
So, I got to ask.

49:49.987 --> 49:53.867
Is it true that when a princess whistles,
birds fly down from the skies, and...

49:53.949 --> 49:57.078
Hello, stereotype.
That is a complete and total myth.

49:57.578 --> 49:58.750
I'm sorry.

49:59.914 --> 50:05.091
Did you realize that on the first emoji set,
a woman can either be a princess or a bride?

50:05.586 --> 50:09.466
That's why I need to get to the cloud,
where you can be whoever you want to be.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.177
Get ready. Whale song coming.

50:12.259 --> 50:14.387
- Wait, wait. Whale what?
- A whale song.

50:14.470 --> 50:16.768
From Alex's biology presentation.

50:28.108 --> 50:30.782
You're not gonna see that
sitting around in a cube.

50:33.280 --> 50:36.625
It's funny.
You want out of the cube, and I want in.

50:37.451 --> 50:41.957
Gene, if that means you can't be yourself,
what's the point?

50:43.457 --> 50:47.007
You know, I think you're pretty cool
just the way you are.

51:00.432 --> 51:02.651
We're gonna need this.

51:06.313 --> 51:11.160
<i>Nobody knows the touchscreens I've seen</i>

51:11.902 --> 51:15.031
<i>Nobody knows my screenshots</i>

51:15.614 --> 51:19.539
In the trash? Me? I used to be somebody.

51:20.077 --> 51:23.331
Here I am. Look.
In an old e-mail Alex never sent.

51:23.706 --> 51:25.549
"Addie..."

51:27.418 --> 51:29.089
And then there's me, Hi-5,

51:29.169 --> 51:31.297
right there, doing my job.

51:33.257 --> 51:36.352
FYI, nobody cares about you.

51:36.677 --> 51:40.181
Just leave me, Troll, and let me die

51:40.764 --> 51:43.062
in this dump alone.

51:43.434 --> 51:46.148
Let me look for the world's
smallest violin in here,

51:46.228 --> 51:47.650
so you can play it.

51:50.441 --> 51:53.490
It's the Hand Angel of Mercy.
She's finally come for me.

51:55.195 --> 51:56.367
Give me your hand!

51:56.447 --> 51:57.994
I mean, give me yourself.

51:58.198 --> 51:59.996
Take my hand, angel.

52:01.160 --> 52:04.875
I'm ready to take my place
amongst the other great hands of the past.

52:04.955 --> 52:07.128
- It's me, Gene!
- Gene?

52:07.291 --> 52:08.634
The one and only.

52:08.751 --> 52:10.719
- Gene!
- I got him!

52:14.048 --> 52:15.391
Take me with you.

52:16.050 --> 52:18.597
- Hi-5!
- Let go of me.

52:18.677 --> 52:20.145
Don't leave me down here!

52:22.056 --> 52:24.935
You were wrong, Troll.
People do care about me.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.480
And I'm not upset, Troll.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.279
Do you see how not upset I am?

52:31.398 --> 52:34.447
Gene, you came back for me.

52:34.902 --> 52:36.495
You saved me.

52:36.612 --> 52:38.580
It wasn't just me. Jailbreak helped, too.

52:38.781 --> 52:40.579
And she's a hugger. Give her a squeeze.

52:40.908 --> 52:41.996
No, no, no.

52:42.076 --> 52:47.003
There really is nothing greater
than the feeling of being truly free.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.930
You filthy trolls, I inhaled your stench,

52:55.255 --> 52:58.225
but I was once one of you,
so I, too, feel your pain.

52:58.759 --> 53:00.762
Now go. Be free!

53:02.096 --> 53:03.939
Should be smooth sailing from here.

53:15.651 --> 53:17.119
Gene.

53:20.948 --> 53:22.200
Gene.

53:27.454 --> 53:28.581
Gene?

53:28.956 --> 53:30.833
Are you Instagramming?

53:40.050 --> 53:42.018
Where is my Gene?

54:09.538 --> 54:10.665
Mary.

54:11.165 --> 54:13.259
You've really done it this time.

54:14.334 --> 54:16.632
- No, you haven't.
- Mel?

54:17.004 --> 54:20.133
What are you doing
in Alex's trip to France album?

54:20.466 --> 54:22.184
I was looking for you.

54:22.468 --> 54:24.687
None of this is your fault, Mary.

54:24.970 --> 54:26.097
It's mine.

54:26.638 --> 54:28.311
What do you mean?

54:33.854 --> 54:36.232
Is that a tear on your cheek?

54:36.732 --> 54:38.735
It's my fault Gene is the way he is.

54:39.526 --> 54:41.403
I have other expressions, too.

54:41.737 --> 54:43.740
I think they've just been buried away.

54:44.323 --> 54:48.999
But with Gene going missing
and thinking I might have lost you, too...

54:49.369 --> 54:52.373
Mel. Why didn't you tell me?

54:53.207 --> 54:55.050
I didn't know myself.

54:55.959 --> 55:01.056
Right now, I'm so overwhelmed
with passionate feelings for you.

55:06.887 --> 55:10.561
Mary, my love for you burns
with the intensity

55:10.641 --> 55:12.234
of a red-hot flame.

55:12.851 --> 55:14.649
I like that, Mel.

55:16.855 --> 55:18.732
Let's go find our son.

55:18.941 --> 55:20.238
Together.

55:24.696 --> 55:26.915
We'll always have Paris, Mary.

55:31.954 --> 55:33.667
So, you're a princess.

55:33.747 --> 55:36.336
I saw your little tiara. Very fancy.

55:36.416 --> 55:38.669
Is it true when a princess whistles,

55:38.752 --> 55:40.504
- birds fly down from...
- That's what I said!

55:40.587 --> 55:43.010
No, guys! That's a stupid myth!

55:43.090 --> 55:45.764
What software version are we living in?

55:45.884 --> 55:47.222
Go read an e-book.

55:47.302 --> 55:48.724
- Jailbreak...
- Educate yourselves.

55:48.804 --> 55:50.727
- Just look behind you.
- What the...

55:53.183 --> 55:54.184
What is that?

55:54.268 --> 55:56.231
Smiler must have upgraded her Bots.

55:56.311 --> 55:57.357
Let's get out of here before it...

55:57.437 --> 55:59.777
<i>Hi, Gene. Remember me? Smiler.</i>

55:59.857 --> 56:02.360
<i>I'm coming to you live from the amphitheater.</i>

56:02.442 --> 56:06.948
<i>Why don't you come back to Textopolis and</i>
<i>we can talk through our differences, okay?</i>

56:07.281 --> 56:11.787
<i>My friend here will escort you, all right?</i>
<i>I'm gonna see you soon, buddy. Bye, now.</i>

56:12.619 --> 56:15.213
<i>We're actually gonna delete him</i>
<i>in front of everyone.</i>

56:15.831 --> 56:17.333
- <i>It's still on!</i>
- <i>It's still what?</i>

56:17.749 --> 56:19.376
<i>Jiminy Sassafras!</i>

56:21.628 --> 56:22.629
Move!

56:30.762 --> 56:32.139
Separate!

56:49.781 --> 56:51.124
Tangle him up!

56:56.663 --> 56:59.211
- Jailbreak!
- Gene! This way!

56:59.291 --> 57:00.634
- It's still after me!
- Over here!

57:09.801 --> 57:11.053
Let's go.

57:13.263 --> 57:14.936
We have to make it to Dropbox.

57:19.853 --> 57:20.900
- Yes!
- Yes!

57:21.396 --> 57:23.239
- No!
- Go low!

57:33.033 --> 57:34.580
Don't worry. It can't get in.

57:34.868 --> 57:37.212
It's illegal malware, and this app is secure.

57:41.667 --> 57:43.010
Come on.

57:43.752 --> 57:46.967
<i>Welcome to Dropbox.</i>
<i>You are about to leave the phone.</i>

57:47.047 --> 57:48.924
<i>Remain seated, please.</i>

57:51.301 --> 57:52.894
You might want to hang on.

57:53.345 --> 57:55.473
Why do they call this Dropbox, anyway?

57:55.555 --> 57:57.649
This is why! I see that now!

58:00.894 --> 58:01.895
Yeah!

58:05.190 --> 58:07.488
I think we're about to see
that candy corn again!

58:13.740 --> 58:15.117
We made it.

58:15.325 --> 58:19.046
Guys, guys, chill.
We still have to get past that.

58:29.172 --> 58:30.845
- Holy...
- Yeah.

58:31.133 --> 58:32.680
<i>Hello.</i>

58:33.093 --> 58:34.720
<i>Welcome to the firewall.</i>

58:34.803 --> 58:36.305
<i>How may I help you?</i>

58:36.388 --> 58:38.265
- All right, here goes.
- What do I do?

58:38.348 --> 58:40.601
Sit in the corner and don't say a word.

58:40.684 --> 58:42.812
Keep those sausage fingers to yourself.

58:42.894 --> 58:45.067
Yes, Your Majesty Princess of Nightmares!

58:45.147 --> 58:49.402
Now, Gene, step onto the password icon,
and I'll feed you the passwords.

58:49.484 --> 58:50.485
Okay.

58:52.821 --> 58:57.162
Okay. 10-11-2002.

58:57.242 --> 59:00.246
10-11-2002.

59:03.623 --> 59:05.466
<i>Access denied.</i>

59:06.126 --> 59:08.048
Okay, try a different expression.

59:08.128 --> 59:10.342
Is it gonna blast me every time I mess up?

59:10.422 --> 59:11.885
Yeah, kinda.

59:11.965 --> 59:13.342
What do you mean, "Kinda"?

59:13.425 --> 59:14.847
Ready?

59:15.135 --> 59:17.307
<i>Welcome to the firewall.</i>

59:17.387 --> 59:19.726
His favorite food. Chimichangas.

59:19.806 --> 59:20.978
Chimichangas?

59:23.977 --> 59:25.354
<i>Access denied.</i>

59:27.230 --> 59:28.231
This might take a while.

59:28.607 --> 59:29.903
Oh, boy.

59:29.983 --> 59:31.826
Krav Maga.

59:32.277 --> 59:34.116
Krav Maga.

59:34.196 --> 59:35.914

- Major Lazer.

59:36.990 --> 59:37.991
<i>Abuela</i> Dora!

59:38.575 --> 59:40.077

<i>Access denied.</i>

59:42.329 --> 59:44.172
<i>Denied.</i>

59:50.962 --> 59:52.259
I don't get it.

59:52.339 --> 59:55.093
We've tried all the important things
in Alex's life.

59:55.175 --> 59:58.850
His favorite pet, sport,
his favorite grandma.

59:59.471 --> 01:00:00.892
I'm sorry, Gene.

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:02.690
I let us all down.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:07.899
You know, if I had to
come up with a password,

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:10.277
I'd probably use the name of a girl I liked.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.029
I've been all over the phone.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.782
He's never mentioned a girl.

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:15.741
Yes, he has.

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:20.120
Hi. When I was in the trash,
I read a very interesting e-mail,

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.921
but I'm just the dunce in the corner,
forbidden to speak.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:26.126
- What e-mail?
- Sorry, what?

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.294
What e-mail?

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:28.751
To a girl at school.

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.297
He was declaring his feelings
of love for her.

01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:33.881
I guess instead of sending it,
he tossed it in the trash.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:35.841
Hi-5, this is very important.

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:37.301
What is her name?

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:39.598
Her name, yes. Excellent question.

01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:42.100
It was Tina.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.393
Karen.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.812
Marge. Lindsey.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.394
Alison.

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:50.567
Sarah or Lupita.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.110
I want to say Lupita,

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:54.988
but that doesn't feel right
now I'm saying it out loud.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.156
Jennifer.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.783
- Got to find that e-mail.
- Phillipa.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:00:59.201
- Sue. Deborah.
- I think I can access the trash.

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:00.282
Annabelle.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:01.703
- I got it! Addie!
- Yes!

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:03.285
Yes! That's it! Addie!

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.211
I knew I'd get there.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:10.712
"Dear Addie, you and I,
we're like diamonds in the sky.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:12.795
"You're a shooting star I see,

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:14.800
"a vision of ecstasy.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.929
"Shine bright like a diamond."

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.474
And he used a high five, see?

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:24.431
I guess now we know why he trashed it.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:25.974
Shade.

01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:28.151
Guys, should we try this?

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:38.529
Addie.

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:41.740
<i>Access granted.</i>

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:45.331
Snap.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:02.098
This place is amazing.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.766
The cloud.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:06.894
I can't believe it.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:12.483
One little emoji could sure get lost
in a place like this.

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:22.456
I guess we should make you a Meh
before that Bot comes back, huh?

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:26.331
So, we're gonna... We're gonna do that now?

01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:29.332
We had a deal.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.504
Right?

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:33.962
Yeah, okay. Right.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.636
I guess I'll start hacking.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:00.653
We did it, Gene.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.612
All our dreams are coming true.

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:05.994
I'll be an Alex favorite again,
and you'll be a real Meh.

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:07.326
Yeah!

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:09.247
<i>Do the hand dance</i>
<i>Do the hand dance</i>

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.079
<i>And pinky</i>
<i>Pop it with the pinky</i>

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:12.539
<i>Pop it with the pinky</i>

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:15.670
Yeah, but this all seems
kind of super-fast now, though.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.088
Doesn't it?

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:21.344
Hi-5, I just didn't expect
to be having these feelings right now.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.969
Well, maybe you should go and express them
while you still can.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:33.777
So, I've been... I mean...

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:35.820
Ever since we...

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:41.321
Jailbreak, you're the coolest,
most interesting emoji I've ever met.

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:44.115
And after all the adventures that we had,

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:46.409
I'm just not sure I want all that to go away,

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:50.244
because my feelings
right now are, like, huge.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.876
I just think that they could be enough for me
to want to stay the way I am.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:57.501
If it means I could stay here with you.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:03:58.630
Like, forever.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.007
Forever and ever and ever.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.930
Maybe longer than that even.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.262
Like in the fairy tales.

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:13.100
Like, what is "uh"? Is that a good "uh"?

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:17.855
Gene, if this is about
you deciding not to be meh,

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:20.190
then I am all about that.

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:23.611
I like you just the way you are.

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:27.079
But I had a plan.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.288
Right.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:35.373
I'm not just some princess, Gene,
waiting for my prince.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:42.092
I mean, what you said was beautiful, but...

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.215
Gene.

01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:49.222
You're all meh.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:50.849
The source code worked!

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:53.148
Turns out I didn't need it.

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:57.648
For the first time in my life,
meh is all I feel.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.698
No! Gene!

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:04.612
Hi. I have an appointment.
I'm a little early.

01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:06.535
No problem. I can take you right now.

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:27.758
Jailbreak!

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:29.137
Don't do that!

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:32.640
That freaky huge Bot has got Gene
back inside the phone.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.721
What?

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:37.020
He left looking more meh
than the meh-est meh face I've ever seen.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.352
What did you say to him?

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.814
It's what I didn't say.

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:44.194
We've got to go get him.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:47.778
How are we gonna get in there in time
before he gets deleted?

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.488
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:54.159
You tell anyone you saw this,
and I'll crack more than those knuckles.

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.872
Birds do love princesses!

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:39.165
It's not a myth.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.122
It's not a myth at all!

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:45.004
What happened to becoming a favorite?

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:47.382
Guess I'd rather have one real friend.

01:06:47.462 --> 01:06:49.089
And let's go get him.

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:56.187
I can't wait to see the look on Gene's face!

01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.855
Look at that expression.

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:07.026
Is that for realizing
you've put all of Textopolis at risk,

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.609
causing Alex to question our reliability?

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:14.367
Hey, that's going too far, even for me.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:18.077
If we can delete this malfunction
before his appointment,

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:20.537
they'll discover
there's nothing wrong with the phone.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.463
Any last words?

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:24.752
Meh.

01:07:24.832 --> 01:07:26.045
Well, it's too late for that.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.253
- Delete him!
- Wait.

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:34.343
You delete Gene,
you'll have to delete me, too.

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:38.184
- What?
- I have the same malfunction Gene does.

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:42.809
Dad?

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:45.145
Oh, gosh, I don't know what to do.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:46.274
Yes, I do.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:47.526
Bot!

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.108
No!

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:51.943
Sorry, Mrs. Meh.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.829
I did not see that one coming.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:03.374
Smiler, I think you might be making
too much stink out of all this.

01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:05.798
Really? How about you're next?

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:11.341
I was wrong, Gene.

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:13.924
I should've believed in you all along.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:17.386
What a touching daddy-son reunion moment.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:19.845
It reminds me of the time I deleted you both.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.185
Wait. That's this time!

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.359
Delete the two malfunctions!

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:27.691
No.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:32.321
How's that for an...

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:41.952
Great.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.468
I can't reach!

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:11.982
No! What did you do to my beautiful...

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:14.234
My tooth.

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.497
Hand, button.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.376
Jailbreak?

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.124
Gene.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.792
You really are a Meh.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:31.251
What happened to looking out for number one?

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:35.385
Being number one doesn't matter
if there aren't any other numbers.

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:39.258
Alex's appointment!

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.930
He's deleting the phone!

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.761
No, no, no!

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.721
Show me Alex.

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:49.560
<i>Are you sure you want to delete everything?</i>

01:09:49.644 --> 01:09:50.645
<i>Do it.</i>

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:57.652
Red alert! Red alert!

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.328
Alex, no!

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.291
<i>Game over.</i>

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:13.134
Fellas, I'm afraid this is last call.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:16.550
Dude, Addie's here. You should go over.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.389
Every time I try, I screw it up.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:25.179
<i>I don't know how to tell her how I feel.</i>

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:28.725
If we help Alex connect to Addie,
maybe he won't delete us.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:31.687
I might be able to bypass the wipe
and get a text through to him.

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.441
But we'll only have time to send one.

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:34.567
Maybe I should go.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:36.115
He has love in his eyes.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:39.072
Send me. Alex looks nervous, too.

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:40.995
He's more shy than nervous.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:42.363
Stop!

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.411
It's Gene.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.038
He's all of those things.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.830
An emoji should only be one thing.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:52.589
Really?

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:54.751
The Princess!

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:55.961
Linda!

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:57.511
Not now, Mom!

01:10:57.962 --> 01:11:00.465
Gene, you got this.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.851
That's not me anymore.

01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:13.482
But I have to try.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:15.566
It's starting!

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.068
No, it's ending!

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.802
- Almost in?
- I'm working on it.

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:42.049
Mom? Dad?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.801
No.

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:46.476
I'm in.

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:50.106
Last time I was in this cube,
I screwed everything up.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.811
Gene, why do you think I came back?

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:55.729
It's because of you.

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:57.734
Me?

01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:00.609
It's all inside of you, Gene.

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:02.785
Just try to bring it back.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.071
And do you.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:08.575
- Hi-5!
- I don't want to wave good-bye.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:11.168
It's now or never, Gene.

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:35.393
Jailbreak, now!

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.252
Check out this emoji.

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:08.844
No way.

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:25.943
Hey, I got your text.

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:28.616
That's one super-cool emoji.

01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:30.539
I know, right?

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.577
A lot of feelings in one. I get it.

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:39.083
I like that you're one of those guys
who can actually express his feelings.

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.293
Yeah. That's me.

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:51.013
- So, do you think you'd want to...
- Yes.

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.596
I'd love to go to the dance with you.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:57.225
Hey, excuse me.

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:25.128
We made it!

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.133
I could've lost you, Peter Pinkie.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.840
Or you, Reggie Ring Finger.

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:30.891
Even you, Tiberius Thumb.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:39.228
Change your mind?

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.060
Yeah, maybe it's weird, but...

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.565
<i>I'm gonna hold on to it.</i>

01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:45.568
Gene, you did it!

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:47.275
You saved us all!

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:02.251
Oh, Mel.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.754
Gene! Gene!

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:05.922
Gene! Gene! Gene!

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:09.342
Gene. Gene. Gene.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:13.220
Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:17.305
Gene! Gene! Gene!

01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:18.976
They love us! And Hi-5!

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:21.810
And Hi-5! And Hi-5! And Hi-5!

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:23.690
They love both of us!

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.465
Hey, what up, Gene? Slap me some skin.

01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:46.959
And a little porridge for the pinkie.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.425
Hey, Hi-5, save me a dance for later.

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:53.929
As long as you're not all hands again.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.260
Back on top of the hand pile.

01:15:58.471 --> 01:15:59.767
You're not on the list.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.315
- Wait, what?
- What's going on?

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:04.397
From now on, everyone is welcome!

01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:06.315
Wait, what is all this?

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.738
It's for you, Gene.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:14.157
Everybody, the Emoji Pop!

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:28.960
This is jazzy.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:36.008
Yeah.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:39.847
Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant!

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.493
We are out of Alex's pocket, emojis.

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.576
This is not a butt dial.

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:03.252
To your cubes.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:14.216
- Are we up and running?
- Roger that.

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.385
Good, 'cause we got incoming.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:17.887
Looks like it's gonna be Gene.

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:24.309
