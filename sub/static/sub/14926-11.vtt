WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:05.573
OH, COME ON.
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

00:05.606 --> 00:06.574
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP YOU, DAD.

00:06.607 --> 00:10.378
YEAH, WELL, I THINK YOU
HELPED ME QUITE ENOUGH.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.512
IS GRANDPA GONNA DIE?

00:11.545 --> 00:12.746
OH, YEAH.
CUT IT OUT.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.348
NO,
HE'S NOT GONNA DIE,

00:14.382 --> 00:16.284
NOW, JUST PLEASE
SIT DOWN, DAD.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.351
I CAN'T SIT DOWN!

00:17.385 --> 00:19.653
OH, YEAH, I FORGOT.
YOU'RE MORTALLY WOUNDED.
WHOO.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.622
THIS PLACE
IS ALL MOBBED UP.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.356
WE'RE GONNA
BE HERE FOREVER.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.358
UH-UH.
I'M TAKING CARE
OF THIS.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.726
WE NEED A DOCTOR
RIGHT AWAY.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.228
WHAT'S THE NATURE
OF THE EMERGENCY?

00:27.261 --> 00:28.429
OH, WAIT. WAIT.
THERE'S NO EMERGENCY HERE.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.497
SURE THERE IS.
NO, NO, NO.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.165
IT'S NOT TRUE. NO.
IT'S VERY TRUE.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.400
NO, IT'S
NOT AN EMERGENCY.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.835
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
THAT'S WHY WE CAME
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM,

00:34.868 --> 00:37.305
TO GET THAT FAST
EMERGENCY SERVICE.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.406
TELL YOU WHAT.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.840
FILL THESE OUT
AND HAVE A SEAT.

00:39.873 --> 00:45.413
NICE WORK.
WE'VE BEEN TRIAGED,
DUMB-ASS.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.414
WHAT'S "TRIAGE"?

00:46.447 --> 00:48.249
IT MEANS
GET USED TO THE SMELL
OF DISINFECTANT,

00:48.282 --> 00:50.218
'CAUSE WE'RE
GONNA BE HERE ALL NIGHT.

00:50.251 --> 00:53.187
I LIKE IT.
IT MAKES ME DIZZY.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.624
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW HOW TO MOVE
THIS THING ALONG.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.526
DAD,
CRY OUT IN ANGUISH.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.093
WHAT?

00:59.127 --> 01:01.662
JUST, YOU KNOW...
AAH!

01:03.731 --> 01:05.133
IT WAS HIM.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.667
GRANDPA,
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

01:06.700 --> 01:10.238
UH, THANKS, JIMMY.
I'LL HAVE A GINGER ALE.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.772
I'LL HAVE A COKE.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.175
IS YOUR NAME GRANDPA?

01:16.344 --> 01:17.345
OH, OFFICER!

01:17.378 --> 01:18.779
OFFICER?
YES?

01:18.812 --> 01:19.747
HEY, DAD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

01:19.780 --> 01:23.184
I WANT THIS MAN ARRESTED
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER!

01:40.168 --> 01:42.436
HE ATTACKED ME--
MY OWN SON!

01:42.470 --> 01:43.371
I DIDN'T ATTACK YOU!

01:43.404 --> 01:45.873
DAD, WE REALLY GOTTA
BRING THE LAW INTO THIS?

01:45.906 --> 01:47.308
AREN'T YOU THE GUY I SAW--

01:47.341 --> 01:49.177
NO, IT WASN'T ME.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.878
I COULD SWEAR--

01:50.911 --> 01:51.845
I GOT THAT KIND OF FACE.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.514
I LOOK LIKE
A LOT OF GUYS...

01:53.547 --> 01:55.716
GUYS THAT AREN'T ME.

01:59.553 --> 02:00.921
WHAT ARE YOU READING?

02:00.954 --> 02:03.857
CIGAR AFICIONADO.

02:03.891 --> 02:04.925
DON'T THEY HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE?

02:04.958 --> 02:06.294
IF THERE WERE
ANYTHING ELSE,

02:06.327 --> 02:08.796
WOULD I BE READING
CIGAR AFICIONADO?

02:08.829 --> 02:11.265
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

02:11.299 --> 02:12.700
THAT'S PORNO.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.701
IT'S NOT PORNO.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.703
IT'S A MAGAZINE
FOR A MAN

02:15.736 --> 02:17.171
IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM

02:17.205 --> 02:19.940
IT'S NOTHING BUT PICTURES
OF NAKED BIMBOS.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.843
HALF-NAKED...ACTRESSES.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.448
IS MY FATHER-IN-LAW
GONNA SEE A DOCTOR
ANYTIME SOON?

02:27.481 --> 02:30.718
HE'S ON THE LIST.
SOMEONE WILL SEE HIM SHORTLY.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.256
YOU'RE BLOWING ME OFF,
AREN'T YOU?

02:35.289 --> 02:36.457
NO.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.727
I HAPPEN TO BE A HOSTESS
IN A VERY POPULAR
SOHO RESTAURANT,

02:39.760 --> 02:42.396
AND I BLOW PEOPLE OFF
ALL DAY LONG.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.130
I KNOW BLOWING OFF,

02:43.163 --> 02:45.466
AND YOU
ARE BLOWING ME OFF.

02:45.499 --> 02:49.337
MA'AM, WE'LL GET TO YOU
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

02:49.370 --> 02:54.675
SEE, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I SAY!

02:55.676 --> 02:57.945
DAD, WILL YOU
LEAVE THIS GUY ALONE?!

02:57.978 --> 02:59.747
NO. I WANT HIM TO HEAR THIS.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.884
IT WAS MY GRANDSON JIMMY'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

03:03.917 --> 03:04.785
Claudia: YEAH!

03:04.818 --> 03:08.689
ALL RIGHT. HEY, BUDDY,
THIS ONE IS FROM US.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.892
LILY, IT'S
YOUR BROTHER'S BIRTHDAY.

03:11.925 --> 03:12.793
GET OFF THE PHONE.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.296
NOW SHE'S TELLING ME
TO GET OFF THE PHONE.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.966
NOW SHE'S GIVING ME
THIS LOOK SHE DOES.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.535
I KNOW. I KNOW.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.237
ON WHEELS.

03:23.271 --> 03:27.408
NOW SHE'S
TAKING THE PHONE
AND HANGING IT UP.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.446
COOL!
IT'S A REAL SNARE DRUM.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.615
THAT'S THE KIND
PETER CRISS PLAYS.

03:34.648 --> 03:35.416
WHO?

03:35.449 --> 03:37.285
YOU CAN PLAY WITH THAT
LATER, JIMMY.

03:37.318 --> 03:41.622
NOW, SAVING THE BEST
FOR LAST.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.256
WHOA.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.424
Sean: HEY, WHAT IS IT, DAD?

03:43.457 --> 03:44.224
HE'S GONNA LOVE IT.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.827
IT'S FROM BOTH OF US.
NO, IT'S NOT.

03:46.860 --> 03:50.398
ALL RIGHT!
IT'S A BB GUN!

03:50.431 --> 03:53.033
A BB GUN.
A BB GUN.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.369
WHOA.

03:57.838 --> 04:01.041
OF COURSE HE COULDN'T STAND
THAT JIMMY LIKED
MY GIFT BETTER.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.510
WRONG. WRONG.
WHAT I CAN'T STAND

04:02.543 --> 04:04.278
IS THAT YOU THINK
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME

04:04.312 --> 04:06.414
ABOUT WHAT I SHOULD DO
WITH MY FAMILY!

04:06.447 --> 04:08.048
WELL,
THAT'S BECAUSE I DO!

04:08.081 --> 04:10.984
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
LIKE THAT TIME HENRY
HAD THE NOSEBLEED?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.921
TILT HIM FORWARD.
HE'S GOT TO LEAN
INTO THE FLOW.

04:13.954 --> 04:14.822
NO, DAD, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.357
COME ON, HENRY,
JUST LEAN YOUR HEAD BACK.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.525
YOU'LL CHOKE HIM
THAT WAY.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.060
NO--NO, I WON'T. LOOK,
JUST TILT YOUR HEAD BACK
AND RELAX.

04:20.093 --> 04:20.828
THAT'S THE--
FORWARD!

04:20.861 --> 04:22.730
NO, DAD, I'M HIS DAD.
I SAY BACK!

04:22.763 --> 04:23.964
IT'S GOTTA BE FORWARD!
IT'S GOTTA BE BACK!

04:23.997 --> 04:26.534
LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

04:26.567 --> 04:27.868
HE'S MY SON!
HE GOES BACK!

04:29.770 --> 04:32.640
FORWARD DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.
THINK ABOUT IT!

04:32.673 --> 04:34.542
ASK ANY DOCTOR
IN THIS PLACE.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.644
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.611
HEY, HEY, HEY!

04:37.645 --> 04:38.412
YOU'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE
OF A NOSEBLEED, RIGHT?

04:38.446 --> 04:40.481
RIGHT.
SO WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

04:40.514 --> 04:41.415
WELL,
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:41.449 --> 04:43.050
IS HE NEVER RESPECTS
MY JUDGMENT ON ANYTHING.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.619
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
IS A BB GUN, OK,

04:45.653 --> 04:48.456
THAT SHOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN IN OUR HOUSE.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.861
WHAT IS OUR POLICY
ON THIS?

04:53.894 --> 04:56.830
UH, WE DON'T HAVE
A POLICY ON THIS.

04:56.864 --> 04:57.665
WE DON'T HAVE POLICIES.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.501
OH, COME ON.
ALL PARENTS HAVE POLICIES.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.301
WE MUST HAVE SOME.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.437
I DON'T KNOW, BABE.
IT'S JUST A TOY.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.739
IT'S SHAPED LIKE A GUN.

05:05.773 --> 05:06.774
YEAH, WELL, SO IS FLORIDA,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.909
AND WE DON'T HAVE
A POLICY ON THAT.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.077
THAT'S A COMPELLING ARGUMENT.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.646
WELL, I MEAN, IT'S JUST
JIMMY SEEMS TO LOVE
THIS THING,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.349
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE JERK WHO TAKES IT
AWAY FROM HIM.

05:15.383 --> 05:18.018
BESIDES,
HE'S PRETTY RESPONSIBLE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

05:18.051 --> 05:19.019
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.988
I MEAN, HE WAS GREAT
WITH THAT WOOD-BURNING SET.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.392
WELL...

05:27.628 --> 05:28.529
UH...

05:28.562 --> 05:31.932
IT'S OK.
WE WON'T TELL
YOUR MOM ABOUT THIS.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.505
MAYBE HE'S NOT READY
FOR A BB GUN.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.842
ALL RIGHT.
NOW YOU GOT IT.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.012
OH, HEY,
LOOK WHAT I CAN DO.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.948
Claudia: WOW.
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

05:47.981 --> 05:51.051
THAT DRUM WE GAVE YOU
IS PRETTY COOL,
TOO, HUH?

05:51.084 --> 05:51.852
YEAH.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.488
HEY, JIMMY, CAN I PLAY
YOUR NEW DRUM?

05:54.522 --> 05:55.689
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.058
UH, HEY, JIMMY,
I KNOW HOW MUCH

05:58.091 --> 05:59.660
YOU'RE ENJOYING
YOUR NEW TOY.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.594
WHAT?

06:00.628 --> 06:01.729
WELL, YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE BEEN TALKING...

06:01.762 --> 06:06.133
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE AWAY
MY FAVORITE PRESENT
OF ALL TIME?

06:06.166 --> 06:07.334
NO, WELL,
WE'RE NOT TAKING IT AWAY.

06:07.367 --> 06:11.004
WHAT WE THINK IS MAYBE
YOU JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE IT
RIGHT NOW.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.408
I WOULDN'T GIVE MY GRANDSON
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT SAFE.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.809
DAD, I'M NOT
SUGGESTING YOU WOULD.

06:15.843 --> 06:16.577
IT'S A GREAT GIFT,

06:16.610 --> 06:17.411
AND HE'S HAD A LOT
OF FUN WITH IT.

06:17.445 --> 06:18.979
OH, YEAH,
THESE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES

06:19.012 --> 06:20.914
ARE SOMETHING
HE'LL TREASURE FOREVER.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.685
DAD, THIS IS
MY FAVORITE PRESENT.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.086
DON'T YOU GUYS TRUST ME?

06:26.119 --> 06:28.922
OF COURSE WE DO.
WE TRUST YOU.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.826
I PROMISE THAT I WILL BE
SUPER CAREFUL WITH IT.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.195
PLEASE?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.664
WELL, HE PROMISED
TO BE CAREFUL.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.467
HE IS WEARING
THE GOGGLES.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.442
IF I HAD TAKEN IT
AWAY FROM HIM THEN,

06:48.476 --> 06:49.843
WE'D BE HOME IN BED NOW.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.111
Jimmy: OH, GRANDPA.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.713
OH, THANKS, JIMMY.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.614
AND, DAD.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.982
YOU GOT ME A SODA?

06:55.015 --> 06:55.949
YEAH.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.785
THANKS, BUDDY.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.620
AAH! OH!

06:59.920 --> 07:04.892
OK, OK, I'M GONNA PRETEND
THAT YOU SHOOK THAT UP
ACCIDENTALLY.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.861
I'LL PRETEND THAT, TOO.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.097
HE'S JUST
A LITTLE OVERTIRED.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.565
YEAH, AND HE HATES ME.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.567
YEAH,
IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAT.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.267
COME ON, GUYS.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.035
LET'S GO
TO THE VENDING MACHINE

07:15.068 --> 07:17.204
AND GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT, OK?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.572
DOES IT HAVE LASAGNA?

07:18.606 --> 07:20.474
NO, IT'S
A SNACK MACHINE, HONEY.

07:20.508 --> 07:24.111
LASAGNA CAN BE A SNACK
IF YOU DON'T EAT A LOT OF IT.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.814
GOOD POINT.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.151
OK, WHAT MAKES HER
ATTRACTIVE?

07:31.184 --> 07:34.087
SHE'S GOT
A SENSE OF MYSTERY.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.756
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
MYSTERY?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.257
SEE HOW SHE'S
GOT HER THUMB HOOKED

07:37.290 --> 07:38.225
IN HER BIKINI STRING
THERE?

07:38.258 --> 07:41.629
IS SHE PULLING IT UP?
IS SHE PULLING IT DOWN?

07:41.662 --> 07:44.765
MAYBE SHE JUST LIKES
HAVING HER THUMBS THERE.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.533
YEAH.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.068
OH, LOOK, SOUP.
THEY'VE GOT SOUP.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.269
YOU LIKE SOUP.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.070
IS IT GOOD SOUP?

07:50.103 --> 07:52.640
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS A HOSPITAL.

07:52.673 --> 07:56.644
ARE YOU SURE YOU GUYS
CAN TRUST ME WITH HOT SOUP?

07:56.677 --> 07:59.547
JIMMY, IT'S NOT
THAT WE CAN'T TRUST YOU.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.182
LOOK, I KNOW
THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS
HAVE BEEN HARD FOR YOU,

08:02.215 --> 08:05.786
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOUR FATHER AND I
ARE NOT MAD AT YOU.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.655
OH, I KNOW.
I'M MAD AT YOU.

08:07.688 --> 08:11.692
WELL, YOU CAN
HAVE SOUP ANYWAY.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.101
OH, COME ON!

08:21.134 --> 08:23.571
IT'S MIDNIGHT.
MY CHILDREN ARE HUNGRY.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.938
I NEED YOUR SOUP.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.574
SEE, IF I HAD
MY BB GUN RIGHT NOW,

08:26.607 --> 08:29.943
WE COULD SHOOT THE SOUP
OUT OF THERE.

08:29.977 --> 08:30.778
COOL.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.146
COME ON. WE GOTTA GET
OUR MONEY BACK.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.783
OK, WELL, EDDIE,
HOW ABOUT HER?

08:35.816 --> 08:37.918
WELL, UM...

08:37.951 --> 08:40.253
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
HER WHOLE ATTITUDE SAYS,

08:40.287 --> 08:42.089
"HEY,
I'M DOWN WITH THAT."

08:42.122 --> 08:43.190
DOWN WITH WHAT?

08:43.223 --> 08:44.558
EXACTLY.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.059
YOU SEE HER?

08:46.093 --> 08:49.029
HER WHOLE ATTITUDE SAYS,
"HEY, I'M A NURSE."

08:49.062 --> 08:51.932
DOESN'T HER UNIFORM
SAY THAT?

08:51.965 --> 08:52.833
YOU KNOW IT.

08:52.866 --> 08:57.104
SEE, UNIFORMS ARE
A MAJOR THING FOR GUYS.

08:57.137 --> 08:57.805
OH, GREAT.

08:57.838 --> 08:58.471
THE ONLY UNIFORM
I GET TO WEAR

08:58.505 --> 09:00.340
IS A CATHOLIC SCHOOL
UNIFORM.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.076
WHAT GUY
IS GONNA LIKE THAT?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.917
WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE QUESTIONS?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.585
NOTHING.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.121
ALL RIGHT.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.123
WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW,

09:16.156 --> 09:17.725
CHRISTINA AND I
WERE HANGING OUT

09:17.758 --> 09:19.026
IN FRONT OF MOCHA JOJO'S
TONIGHT,

09:19.059 --> 09:24.297
AND THESE 2 CUTE JERKS
WOULDN'T STOP BOTHERING US.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.734
HEY.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.268
HEY.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.637
HEY.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.872
HEY.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.807
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS
REALLY ANNOYING.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.876
WELL, THEN THEY
STOPPED BOTHERING ME,

09:35.909 --> 09:38.612
BUT THEY KEPT BOTHERING
CHRISTINA.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.781
HEY, CHRISTINA,
CHECK THIS OUT.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.016
YOU GUYS ARE STUPID.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.051
NO,
YOU'RE STUPID.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.285
YEAH, YOU'RE STUPID.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.789
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH STUPID.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.726
MORONS.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.828
WHAT IS WITH YOUR FRIEND?

09:54.862 --> 09:56.764
I DON'T KNOW.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.736
I MEAN, WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT CHRISTINA?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.772
HER FOREHEAD IS,
LIKE, AN ACRE.

10:04.805 --> 10:08.075
YOU COULD
PROJECT A MOVIE ON IT.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.076
HASN'T SHE HEARD OF BANGS?

10:09.109 --> 10:12.145
YEAH, I CAN SEE
HOW THAT WOULDN'T
BOTHER YOU.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.881
I SAID IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.282
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN LISTENING?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.785
OK.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.655
EXCUSE ME. HELLO!

10:21.689 --> 10:23.657
YOUR LITTLE SOUP MACHINE
ATE MY MONEY

10:23.691 --> 10:24.658
AND DIDN'T GIVE MY SON
ANY SOUP.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.860
I'M SORRY.
WE'VE BEEN HAVING
PROBLEMS WITH IT.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.096
WELL, YOU COULD HAVE
PUT A SIGN ON IT.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.664
IT WORKS SOME OF THE TIME.

10:30.698 --> 10:33.667
OH. DIDN'T REALIZE
THIS WAS A GAME OF CHANCE.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.737
I WOULD HAVE WORN
MY LUCKY SWEATER.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.740
DO YOU HAVE
ANY LASAGNA BACK THERE?

10:40.874 --> 10:43.210
YOU PUT ME
IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.179
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL
ABOUT A TOY.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.249
OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
WHAT THIS TOY DID.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.327
JIMMY!

11:11.438 --> 11:13.707
PULL!

11:32.192 --> 11:35.763
OH, BETTER GET ME
A PRIEST.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.497
THIS BB IS ON THE MOVE.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.166
NO, IT'S NOT.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.834
ONCE IT GETS
INTO MY BLOODSTREAM,

11:40.868 --> 11:42.135
IT CAN GO
STRAIGHT TO THE BRAIN.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.172
YEAH, IT'S ALREADY
LODGED IN YOUR BRAIN.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.941
LOOK! I HAVE OTHER THINGS
I COULD BE DOING.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.509
IF YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE
TO TELL ME, THEN--

11:49.542 --> 11:53.346
NO, NO. I AM THE VICTIM
OF AN ASSAULT.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.949
THEN CAN WE JUST
GET ON WITH IT, PLEASE?

11:55.983 --> 11:57.084
YES. ALLOW ME.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.452
Sean: JIMMY,
YOU SHOULDN'T SHOOT
PERFECTLY GOOD FRUIT.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.420
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.924
IT'S JUST SO COOL
WHEN THE JUICE SQUIRTS OUT.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.125
IT'S LIKE BLOOD.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.194
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.
JUST DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

12:07.227 --> 12:07.961
NO, DON'T THROW IT OUT.

12:07.995 --> 12:08.996
JUST PICK THE BBs OUT
AND EAT IT.

12:09.029 --> 12:12.900
OH, YEAH, DAD?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THIS?

12:12.933 --> 12:14.067
HUH?

12:14.101 --> 12:15.502
YOUR FATHER'S RIGHT,
JIMMY,

12:15.535 --> 12:17.938
JUST BECAUSE THE DRUM
ISN'T YOUR FAVORITE PRESENT

12:17.971 --> 12:21.341
IS NO REASON TO SHOOT IT
WITH YOUR FAVORITE PRESENT.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.210
ALL RIGHT, HEY,
YOU TWO BOYS GO OUT BACK

12:23.243 --> 12:28.081
AND CLEAN THE EGG YOLK
OFF THE PATIO FURNITURE,
ALL RIGHT?

12:28.115 --> 12:29.082
A DRUM.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.884
A DRUM
IS A COOL PRESENT.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.920
HEY! HEY!
HEY, EXCUSE ME.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.422
WEREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING
YOUR BROTHERS?

12:35.455 --> 12:38.525
I WATCHED 'EM.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.394
WELL, NOT EVERY MINUTE.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.931
HOLD IT.
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.165
OUT WITH CHRISTINA.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.034
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.001
OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.338
OK, THIS IS MY HOUSE,
AND THIS IS MY DAUGHTER,

12:51.371 --> 12:53.240
AND I'LL DECIDE
THOSE THINGS.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.242
LILY, GO HAVE FUN.

12:55.275 --> 12:55.976
HMM.

12:56.009 --> 12:56.743
Walt: FINE,
BUT BE BACK BY 9:00.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.511
NO, LILY,
DON'T COME BACK AT 9:00.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.080
9:30--
11:00.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.181
10:00.
MIDNIGHT.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.550
YES! THANK YOU, DAD.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.119
OH, HEY, LILY!

13:06.153 --> 13:10.257
COME BACK ANYTIME
YOU DAMN WELL PLEASE.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.561
WHY IN THE HELL
WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

13:14.594 --> 13:17.264
OH, SADLY, MY SON
HAS LOST HIS MIND.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.298
NO,
I WAS MAKING A POINT.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.100
IT MAY HAVE BEEN
A STUPID WAY TO MAKE
THAT POINT,

13:20.133 --> 13:21.501
BUT THE POINT WAS VALID.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.503
SWEETIE, DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUARTERS?

13:23.536 --> 13:25.138
YEAH, BABY.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.074
HOW'S JIMMY DOING?

13:27.107 --> 13:27.774
MUCH BETTER.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.042
SO HE DOESN'T HATE ME
ANYMORE?

13:29.076 --> 13:30.343
OH, NO,
HE TOTALLY HATES YOU,

13:30.377 --> 13:33.981
BUT HE'S FORGIVEN ME
FOR MARRYING YOU.

13:34.014 --> 13:34.982
THAT'S PROGRESS.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.083
MM-HMM. THANKS.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.017
OK, IS SOMEBODY
GONNA TELL ME

13:37.050 --> 13:39.887
HOW THE OLD MAN
GOT THE PELLET IN HIS BUTT?!

13:39.920 --> 13:41.154
OK, WHOA, WHOA.
IT WAS, LIKE, 3 HOURS AGO.

13:41.188 --> 13:44.925
OK, I'M WAITING FOR LILY.
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.295
HEY, BABY, YOU ARE UP LATE.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.098
OH, I JUST NEEDED
TO FIX JIMMY'S DRUM.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.300
OH, REALLY?
HE PLAYED IT?!

13:53.333 --> 13:55.135
UH, HE PLAYED WITH IT.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.569
YOU COMING UPSTAIRS?

13:56.603 --> 14:00.173
NO, I, UH, GONNA WAIT
TILL LILY GETS IN.

14:00.207 --> 14:00.941
SHE'S STILL OUT?

14:00.974 --> 14:02.309
YEAH, IT'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.210
I JUST KIND OF INSISTED

14:03.243 --> 14:04.177
THAT SHE STAY OUT
ALL NIGHT.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.247
OH, NOW,
THAT'S VERY REASSURING.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.918
IT'S THAT DAMN BB GUN,
YOU KNOW?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.585
DAD REFUSES
TO TAKE IT BACK,

14:12.619 --> 14:14.454
AND JIMMY
JUST LOVES THAT THING.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.056
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.325
I WAS GONNA TRY
TO TAKE IT FROM HIM
THIS MORNING,

14:18.358 --> 14:22.429
AND HE JUST LOOKED UP AT ME
WITH THOSE BIG DOE EYES.

14:22.462 --> 14:26.199
NOTHING HAS EVER
MADE ME THIS HAPPY.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.600
IT IS SO HARD.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.369
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE KIND OF PARENT

14:29.402 --> 14:32.072
THAT SUCKS THE JOY
OUT OF HIS KID'S LIFE.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.340
YEAH, ME, NEITHER.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.976
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.145
WE'RE GOOD PARENTS,
RIGHT?

14:38.178 --> 14:40.313
HEY, WE'RE...OK.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.415
I MEAN, THERE ARE WORSE,
RIGHT?

14:42.449 --> 14:43.550
LOTS WORSE.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.585
THAT'S SOMETHING.
MM-HMM.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.220
YEAH.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.421
I'M GONNA
TAKE OUT THE TRASH.

14:48.455 --> 14:52.425
SEE? SOME PARENTS
WOULDN'T EVEN DO THAT.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.095
THEY'D LET THAT GARBAGE
PILE UP AND ROT,

14:55.128 --> 14:58.031
AND THEN THEIR KIDS
WOULD GET CHOLERA.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.166
NOT US.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.600
NOT US.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.551
GET--AAH! AAH!

15:19.652 --> 15:20.653
JIMMY?!

15:20.687 --> 15:21.354
DAD?

15:21.388 --> 15:23.256
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

15:23.290 --> 15:26.193
I THOUGHT THAT SOMEONE
WAS STEALING
OUR GARBAGE.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.261
I WAS JUST
DEFENDING THE HOMESTEAD.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.664
DEFENDING THE HOMESTEAD?

15:31.698 --> 15:34.267
GRANDPA SAID IT.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.970
GRANDPA--

15:37.004 --> 15:39.606
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.009
BECAUSE IF I DO IT,
THEN I'M THE MEAN DAD

15:42.042 --> 15:43.676
WHO'S RUINING
HIS BOY'S FUN,

15:43.710 --> 15:44.444
BUT IF YOU DO IT,

15:44.477 --> 15:45.612
THEN YOU'RE
THE MEAN GRANDFATHER,

15:45.645 --> 15:46.713
AND I CAN LIVE
WITH THAT.

15:46.746 --> 15:47.447
SO THAT'S YOUR IDEA

15:47.480 --> 15:48.681
OF TAKING CHARGE
OF YOUR FAMILY.

15:48.715 --> 15:49.749
HEY, MY FAMILY IS FINE

15:49.782 --> 15:51.451
UNTIL YOU START
MEDDLING IN IT.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.719
OH--

15:52.752 --> 15:54.021
MEN ARE SCUM!

15:54.054 --> 15:54.854
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.189
I THOUGHT YOU WENT OUT
WITH CHRISTINA.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.424
WHY ARE MEN SCUM?

15:57.457 --> 16:00.160
I JUST MEANT
IN GENERAL.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.262
OH, ANOTHER NICE
PARENTING DECISION.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.630
EVER CONSIDERED
WRITING A BOOK?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.765
HEY, LOOK, LOOK, DAD.
JUST GO UPSTAIRS

16:05.798 --> 16:07.334
AND GET THAT THING
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.401
I'M NOT GONNA
WAKE HIM UP.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.536
OH, HE'S AWAKE, ALL RIGHT.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.438
HE'S PROTECTING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
FROM GARBAGE THIEVES.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.007
YEAH, WELL,
IF YOU DON'T LIKE
THAT BB GUN,

16:14.041 --> 16:14.707
YOU TAKE IT AWAY.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.243
NO, NO,
YOU GAVE IT TO HIM,

16:16.276 --> 16:17.444
SO YOU TAKE IT AWAY.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.111
OH--

16:18.145 --> 16:20.013
YOU'RE TAKING AWAY
MY BB GUN?

16:20.047 --> 16:22.649
UH, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.451
I'M NOT. HE IS.
NO, I'M NOT.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.318
HE IS.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.186
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.254
IT WAS MY GIFT
TO JIMMY.

16:27.287 --> 16:31.024
NO, NO, JIMMY, JIMMY,
GRANDPA'S DECISION
IS FINAL.

16:31.058 --> 16:31.791
I'M SORRY.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.726
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.396
HEY, JIMMY,
JUST GO UPSTAIRS
TO YOUR ROOM, OK?

16:36.429 --> 16:38.131
THIS REALLY SUCKS.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.200
GOOD NIGHT, JIMMY.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.136
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.773
JEEZ,
ALL THIS BECAUSE
OF A HARMLESS TOY.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.041
THIS THING IS NOT HARMLESS.

16:48.075 --> 16:48.775
THIS THING HURTS.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.677
YOU GOT GIRL SKIN.
NO, IT HURTS!

16:50.710 --> 16:52.112
IT DOESN'T HURT.
OH, YOU WANNA SEE

16:52.145 --> 16:53.813
HOW MUCH
IT DOESN'T HURT?
HUH?

16:53.846 --> 16:56.549
GO AHEAD. DOESN'T SCARE ME.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.785
I'M NOT GONNA
SHOOT YOU, DAD.

16:58.818 --> 17:02.222
OH, YOU'RE NOT SCARED
TO POP YOUR OLD MAN

17:02.255 --> 17:04.624
WITH THAT LITTLE
HARMLESS TOY, ARE YOU?

17:04.657 --> 17:05.658
DAD, DON'T.
HUH

17:05.692 --> 17:07.794
STOP IT, DAD, COME ON.
HUH

17:07.827 --> 17:10.097
SHOULD I KISS THE BOO-BOO!

17:10.130 --> 17:11.164
HEY!

17:11.198 --> 17:13.633
THAT'S RIGHT, WILMA.
PULL THE TRIGGER.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.503
I'M RIGHT HERE FOR YOU.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.471
I KNEW IT.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.674
I KNEW YOU
DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.444
AAH!

17:24.477 --> 17:26.679
DAD!

17:26.713 --> 17:28.081
DAD, ARE YOU OK?

17:28.115 --> 17:32.552
TELL EDDIE--

17:32.585 --> 17:33.353
YEAH?

17:33.386 --> 17:40.427
I KNOW HE'S BEEN
STEALING MY SHIRTS.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.561
SO YOU ASKED HIM
TO SHOOT YOU?

17:41.594 --> 17:46.266
THEN YOU DEMANDED
HE SHOOT YOU?

17:46.299 --> 17:47.534
THEN HE SHOT YOU?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.269
RIGHT IN THE CAN.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.237
NOW, ARREST HIM.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.771
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT?!

17:51.804 --> 17:53.540
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO DOWN TO THE STATION
WITH ME.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.409
WAIT,
YOU WOULD ARREST HIM
FOR A BB WOUND?

17:56.443 --> 17:58.811
IF YOU WANT TO FILE
AN ASSAULT CHARGE,
I HAVE TO.

17:58.845 --> 18:03.216
YOU STAY OUT
OF MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.318
BUT YOU
JUST WANTED ME TO--

18:05.352 --> 18:07.820
MOVE ALONG!

18:08.721 --> 18:10.690
HEY, THANKS, DAD.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.260
ARRESTING MY LITTLE BOY.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.795
DAD,
I'M SORRY I SHOT YOU.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.132
WELL,
MAYBE I ASKED FOR IT.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.433
YOU DID ASK FOR IT.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.470
DAD, BUT YOU GOT
TO LET ME BE BOSS
IN MY OWN HOUSE.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.173
I MEAN,
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,
GETTING THAT BB GUN?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.341
YOU WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.542
I WAS PANICKED.

18:29.576 --> 18:33.880
EVERY DAMN TOY I LOOKED AT
HAD ONE OF THOSE
POKÉMEN ON IT.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.449
OR THOSE IDIOTIC ROBOTS

18:36.483 --> 18:39.752
THAT DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE
TRUCKS OR DINOSAURS.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.389
I WAS CONFUSED.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.523
IT USED TO BE SIMPLE.

18:43.556 --> 18:47.560
I JUST WANTED A TOY
ME AND JIMMY COULD ENJOY
TOGETHER.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.529
Nurse: MR. FINNERTY?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.732
DAD--DAD, YOU COULD HAVE
JUST ASKED ME.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.502
OH, YEAH.
YOU GOT HIM A DRUM.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.837
OK. ENJOY YOUR SURGERY.

18:57.870 --> 19:01.208
HE'S GOING TO
ADULT CIRCUMCISION.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.744
Lily:
I MEAN, COME ON.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.846
CHRISTINA
IS A FLAG GIRL.

19:06.879 --> 19:10.350
A FLAG GIRL IS
JUST A FAT CHEERLEADER.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.784
NOW--NOW,
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.655
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND,
BUT WHAT IS WITH
ALL THE GLITTER?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.724
IT'S, LIKE, GLITTER
EVERYWHERE ON HER.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.227
IS SHE--
IS SHE A PERSON,

19:20.260 --> 19:23.263
OR IS SHE A DISCO BALL?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.265
WHO'S CHRISTINA?
THE REAL TALL ONE?

19:25.298 --> 19:26.566
THE ONE
WITH THE GLITTER.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.436
OH, OH! THE BRUNETTE.
OH, PLEASE.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.638
SHE'S NOTHING.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.505
REALLY?

19:32.539 --> 19:34.507
YEAH, I'VE KNOWN
LOTS OF GIRLS LIKE HER.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.209
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S
GOT GOING FOR HER?

19:36.243 --> 19:37.844
SHE'S EASY.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.847
YOU'RE SAYING
SHE'S SLUTTY?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.583
NO, I'M SAYING
SHE'S OBVIOUS...

19:43.616 --> 19:45.652
NOT COMPLICATED.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.788
OK,
AND SHE'S GOT NO DEPTH.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.758
YOU KNOW,
GUYS AREN'T THREATENED
BY HER.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.393
SO, I'M COMPLICATED?

19:53.426 --> 19:56.563
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU.
YOU'RE...

19:56.596 --> 20:00.267
THAT'S SCARY FOR A GUY.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.801
DO I SCARE YOU?

20:01.834 --> 20:03.670
YOU SCARE THE CRAP
OUT OF ME.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.772
THAT'S COOL.

20:05.805 --> 20:06.806
YEAH.

20:06.839 --> 20:07.507
HMM.

20:07.540 --> 20:12.612
SO, UH,
YOU DON'T LIKE SLUTTY?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.386
NO.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.423
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE MEAN DAD.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.292
MY DAD IS THE MEAN DAD.

20:25.325 --> 20:29.729
LOOK, SEAN, EVERY DAD
HAS TO BE THE MEAN DAD.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.964
IT'S WHY BEING THE MOM
IS SO GREAT.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.534
DON'T RUB IT IN.

20:37.069 --> 20:37.737
SWEETIE--

20:37.770 --> 20:40.707
HUH? WHY AM I
IN CHURCH NAKED?

20:42.309 --> 20:45.345
SHH.
SORRY, GOD.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.414
OH.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.682
HEY, BUDDY.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.685
WORD ON THE STREET
IS THAT YOU HATE ME.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.287
YEAH.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.557
WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO GET YOU TO LIKE ME?

20:57.590 --> 21:00.893
EXCEPT GIVE YOU BACK
THAT BB GUN?

21:00.927 --> 21:01.761
NO.

21:01.794 --> 21:02.595
HEY, LOOK, JIMMY,

21:02.629 --> 21:04.364
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
THE BAD GUY HERE,

21:04.397 --> 21:05.398
OK, BUT SOMETIMES AS A DAD

21:05.432 --> 21:08.535
YOU GOT TO MAKE DECISIONS
THAT AREN'T TOO POPULAR,

21:08.568 --> 21:10.803
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO TAKE THAT GUN AWAY,

21:10.837 --> 21:11.671
BUT IT WAS DANGEROUS.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.507
YEAH, I KNOW.
YOU SHOT GRANDPA
WITH IT.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.344
YES, I DID.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.011
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.914
THE POINT IS, AS A DAD,

21:21.948 --> 21:23.816
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO DO
WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT,

21:23.850 --> 21:28.788
AND YOU ARE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.860
DAD...

21:33.893 --> 21:34.694
YEAH?

21:34.727 --> 21:35.762
I DON'T HATE YOU.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.664
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.066
NOW CAN I HAVE
MY BB GUN BACK?

21:41.067 --> 21:41.901
NO.

21:41.934 --> 21:42.835
I HATE YOU!

21:42.869 --> 21:44.036
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU ALREADY SAID
YOU DIDN'T.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.572
NO, BUT I DO.
TOO LATE.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.506
CAN I HAVE A REAL GUN?

21:46.539 --> 21:48.508
NOPE.
OK, THEN
JUST A BB GUN.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.409
UH, NO.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.109
OH, I HATE YOU.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.578
NO, YOU DON'T.
I DO.

21:51.611 --> 21:52.512
YOU CAN'T
TAKE IT BACK.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.013
I WON'T SHOOT
ANY MORE FRUIT.

21:54.046 --> 21:54.847
YOU LOVE ME.

22:05.024 --> 22:08.528
CAN'T TAKE THAT THING
AWAY FROM HIM, CAN WE?

22:08.561 --> 22:11.398
NOPE.
