Urgent! Urgent!

01:58.459 --> 01:59.792
Please come to the car park and help!

02:19.208 --> 02:20.250
Breaking news

02:20.375 --> 02:23.124
huge police force was deployed
to blockade Kowloon city Plaza.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.125
Don't worry

02:24.126 --> 02:25.875
it'll be done nicely, for sure.

02:28.417 --> 02:29.250
Cordon off

02:29.333 --> 02:30.708
- don't let anyone in.
- Yes sir!

02:41.542 --> 02:42.708
Hey! Who are you?

02:43.125 --> 02:44.292
You can't get in here.

02:45.292 --> 02:46.750
- I'm talking to you...
- Piss off

02:46.917 --> 02:47.958
hey officer!

02:49.375 --> 02:51.583
Congratulations! Fresh graduated?

02:52.292 --> 02:53.125
How can you tell?

02:53.167 --> 02:54.083
Certainly!

02:54.125 --> 02:56.917
Look charismatic and smart.

02:57.667 --> 02:59.417
Do you know what's happening upstairs?

02:59.458 --> 03:00.333
Something happen?

03:00.334 --> 03:02.374
Yes, were you not informed?

03:02.375 --> 03:03.582
No... No one told me anything.

03:03.583 --> 03:06.750
A young lady was held hostage,
a model apparently.

03:06.833 --> 03:07.708
A model?

03:07.709 --> 03:10.875
I can tell what news headline
is tomorrow right now.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.457
Charismatic, smart,

03:13.458 --> 03:15.582
and brave.

03:15.583 --> 03:18.208
A police officer rescued
a model with big boobies.

03:18.250 --> 03:19.791
Handsome,

03:19.792 --> 03:21.375
and extraordinary.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.499
A brave police officer rescued a model?

03:23.500 --> 03:24.917
Do you agree?

03:25.167 --> 03:26.083
Yes, I do.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.542
So you do your duty,

03:27.583 --> 03:28.667
and I resume mine.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.958
Yes sir!

03:30.042 --> 03:30.833
Dismiss.

03:30.917 --> 03:31.708
Got it!

03:33.167 --> 03:34.375
Oh sir...

03:34.417 --> 03:36.916
- Are you okay?
- Yes... I'm alright.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.000
Your nose is bleeding.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.583
- Need an ambulance?
- No. I'm fine.

03:54.125 --> 03:55.583
- Chau!
- What's that?

03:55.792 --> 03:57.250
Chau!

04:15.417 --> 04:16.499
Fully understand.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.291
No one entering allowed.

04:18.708 --> 04:19.791
Who are you?

04:19.916 --> 04:21.499
Police in-charge. No entering.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.624
I am here for rescue.

04:22.625 --> 04:23.707
Go over there, there is a hospital.

04:23.708 --> 04:24.958
You are just a sweeper, don't lie to me!

04:25.042 --> 04:26.166
No... It's very dangerous inside.

04:26.167 --> 04:27.417
Police cannot handle it.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.333
I said police in-charge, go away!

04:30.042 --> 04:31.583
Who are you? How can you rescue?

04:31.667 --> 04:32.875
Who am I?

04:35.167 --> 04:37.583
Let me tell you everything...

05:34.625 --> 05:36.917
Hi everyone! I am Tim Cheung.

05:37.292 --> 05:39.750
While I was a child, I
was given a nickname,

05:39.833 --> 05:41.500
called "rubbish bin".

05:43.083 --> 05:45.417
That's probably because all my family
members are "rubbish" related.

05:45.583 --> 05:47.208
Lun...

05:47.375 --> 05:48.916
This is my grandma.

05:48.917 --> 05:51.208
All the neighbours know her name,

05:51.333 --> 05:53.666
rubbish witch at the western district.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.583
You've come at the right time!
I'm in danger.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.958
No... Why are you inside a cardboard box?
Please come out.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.707
Got you!

05:59.708 --> 06:01.499
You crazy woman grabbed my cardboard!

06:01.500 --> 06:03.292
Don't you try to bully me!

06:03.500 --> 06:04.292
Lun! Lun!

06:04.293 --> 06:06.874
Since I was little,
I kept seeing her grabbing rubbish,

06:06.875 --> 06:09.083
and Cardboards from others.

06:09.167 --> 06:11.666
Grandpa, I found my ball.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.875
My little wa...

06:12.917 --> 06:15.499
Remember not to be like
him when you grow up.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.082
Degenerate to grab
Cardboards with the elderly.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.083
Understand?

06:20.084 --> 06:21.458
Shame!

06:22.042 --> 06:23.958
Lose a fight to an old man.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.292
- Grandma, I just...
- Lun.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.416
Actually Lun, is my father's name,

06:29.417 --> 06:31.124
who passed away long time ago.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.791
She just keeps mistaking me as her son.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.917
My daughter-in-law would have left
just because you're being so weak.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.208
Grandma...

06:36.250 --> 06:38.082
I don't even have a girlfriend,

06:38.083 --> 06:39.750
not to mention having a wife.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.957
It was said that my parents...

06:41.958 --> 06:44.208
Met each other during sweeping.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.583
So technically speaking...
Rubbish has sort of brought me

06:46.625 --> 06:48.582
to this world.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.708
Okay... I'll help finding your trolley.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.499
How about stand up first?

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
The floor is dirty.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.458
I go searching now.

06:54.459 --> 06:55.958
You go back home first, okay?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.499
I wonder I'm...

06:58.500 --> 07:00.750
The biggest rubbish in the world?

07:10.833 --> 07:12.583
What's going on with you?

07:15.500 --> 07:16.999
Sorry... I...

07:17.000 --> 07:18.916
I'm not scolding at you.

07:18.917 --> 07:20.125
I'm so sorry.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.207
Tell me...

07:22.208 --> 07:22.917
What's happened?

07:22.918 --> 07:24.250
Please tell me.

07:44.667 --> 07:45.625
Little wa...

07:46.000 --> 07:47.167
Listen,

07:47.250 --> 07:49.041
rush back home immediately.

07:49.042 --> 07:50.667
If you see any police officers pass by,

07:50.708 --> 07:52.541
tell them to come over here asap.

07:52.542 --> 07:54.375
- Understand?
- Yes

07:54.708 --> 07:55.833
run

08:06.542 --> 08:07.333
hey

08:38.167 --> 08:39.957
what the hell is that?

08:59.750 --> 09:01.667
Grandma, sweep it later.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.292
Come dinner first, the
food is getting cold.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.250
It's okay, you guys help yourselves.

09:05.333 --> 09:08.500
Rarely you come visit me,
I want to show my pleasure.

09:17.292 --> 09:18.583
Lun, you are awake.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.250
Come and eat.

09:20.292 --> 09:22.458
Chau and Uncle Chung have bought it for us.

09:30.292 --> 09:32.166
Tim, come and eat.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.208
Help yourself.

09:56.542 --> 09:57.958
I can't believe...

09:58.042 --> 10:00.333
Tim fell in the back alley.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.083
Luckily you guys were there.

10:08.542 --> 10:11.333
Grandma, you said you prepared
something for me?

10:11.542 --> 10:13.500
Yes, you're right! Prunes!

10:26.500 --> 10:27.583
Chau

10:31.000 --> 10:33.500
don't worry, he is fine.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.208
Go

10:43.375 --> 10:44.499
Tim...

10:44.500 --> 10:45.750
Don't be afraid.

10:46.708 --> 10:50.375
Do you want to know what
happened last night?

10:50.875 --> 10:52.792
Come to me tomorrow.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.583
Grandma, we're leaving.

10:59.667 --> 11:03.875
Sivi: You have arrived
at Tai Wo street 213.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.083
Thanks.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.917
Sivi: It's my pleasure.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.750
Are you looking for Uncle Chung?

11:18.167 --> 11:19.416
Excuse me... I...

11:19.417 --> 11:21.958
Over there.

11:22.208 --> 11:23.542
Thank you.

11:29.833 --> 11:30.875
Excuse me...

11:40.625 --> 11:41.583
Thanks.

12:09.167 --> 12:10.208
Tim

12:10.833 --> 12:11.999
Uncle

12:12.000 --> 12:13.583
it's good to see you.

12:14.042 --> 12:15.083
Me too.

12:16.167 --> 12:17.792
Grandma asks me to bring this to you.

12:18.083 --> 12:21.874
I'm sorry. Public servants
can't accept any gift.

12:21.875 --> 12:22.750
Really?

12:22.751 --> 12:24.708
- You should keep it.
- You're not kidding me...

12:24.833 --> 12:26.291
Since ancient times,

12:26.292 --> 12:28.583
vampires had existed.

12:28.708 --> 12:31.458
Since Hong Kong was opened for trading,

12:31.750 --> 12:33.666
there have always been traces of vampires.

12:33.667 --> 12:34.667
Vam... Vampire?

12:35.208 --> 12:39.583
Yes, they jump with
their arms like this, straight arms.

12:40.917 --> 12:44.792
At first, the Hong Kong government
hired some Maoshan Taoist

12:45.000 --> 12:46.375
to tackle with the vampires.

12:47.083 --> 12:51.249
As time went by, a secret
department was set up

12:51.250 --> 12:53.250
to do the same things.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.583
Uncle...

13:01.875 --> 13:03.583
This is...

13:03.875 --> 13:06.083
I don't understand English.
Call me Uncle Chung.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.625
Sorry... Uncle Chung.

13:07.708 --> 13:10.500
This is our headquarter,

13:10.667 --> 13:13.250
vampire cleanup department.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.583
You just said, you don't
understand English...

13:15.625 --> 13:16.792
Just a little bit.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.458
When a person dies

13:20.500 --> 13:21.792
with injustice

13:22.292 --> 13:25.082
in a cloudy day, at a gloomy place.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.250
Then he might turn into a vampire.

13:29.708 --> 13:30.583
Over there,

13:31.083 --> 13:32.250
master ginger

13:32.917 --> 13:34.249
is the only Maoshan Taoist

13:34.250 --> 13:36.333
remain in Hong Kong.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.708
He is drawing the amulet

13:38.875 --> 13:40.625
to exorcise a vampire.

13:46.083 --> 13:48.375
Kui. This is Tim.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.707
This is Master Kui.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.541
Specializes in weapon design

13:54.542 --> 13:56.500
and backup rescue,

13:56.542 --> 13:58.333
which means cleaning up the mess.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.375
Again...

14:01.083 --> 14:02.416
This old machine

14:02.417 --> 14:04.167
will be probably terminated very soon.

14:05.583 --> 14:09.333
This incinerator is to
cremate the vampires.

14:22.750 --> 14:23.625
Tim

14:24.583 --> 14:25.542
want a cup of noodles?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.542
No, thanks.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.167
- Uncle
- speak Chinese

14:32.500 --> 14:33.917
- sorry
- I am...

14:34.083 --> 14:35.624
The director here,

14:35.625 --> 14:37.416
in charge of technical support

14:37.417 --> 14:39.375
and the cremation.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.792
I see. But may I know...

14:41.833 --> 14:44.250
What happened last night?

14:44.583 --> 14:48.124
You were bitten by a vampire last night,

14:48.125 --> 14:49.874
but you're not infected.

14:49.875 --> 14:52.000
- I were bitten by a vampire?
- Yup.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.791
In this case, you perfectly
fit our department.

14:55.792 --> 14:57.166
Who said that we need to recruit?

14:57.167 --> 14:58.417
The budget was cut,

14:58.500 --> 15:00.250
I can't afford to hire a new staff.

15:00.292 --> 15:01.708
Keep calm, Manager M.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.333
Let's listen to Uncle Chung's explanation.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.625
If we don't recruit some new blood,

15:06.667 --> 15:09.000
who will succeed us when we all get old?

15:09.125 --> 15:10.208
No

15:10.250 --> 15:11.582
if anything ever happens to him...

15:11.583 --> 15:12.583
Won't you feel guilty at all?

15:12.625 --> 15:14.333
You've checked his butt,

15:14.375 --> 15:16.167
he's completely fine after being bitten.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.292
Out of all the other body parts,
it chose his butt.

15:18.458 --> 15:19.792
Be quiet!

15:20.875 --> 15:23.166
Tim? Lun's son'?

15:23.167 --> 15:24.875
What's going on?

15:24.917 --> 15:26.583
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:28.375 --> 15:29.875
thank you all for your caring.

15:29.917 --> 15:31.250
I'm being touched.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.166
However, don't you all
need to worry about me?

15:34.167 --> 15:35.958
I'm not coming for an interview

15:36.292 --> 15:38.624
and I don't even believe
the existence of vampires.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.667
Now, I don't care what happened last night.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.958
Whatever VCDs, DVDs nor Blu-Rays...

15:44.000 --> 15:45.083
I'm not interested at all.

15:46.625 --> 15:47.542
One more thing,

15:47.543 --> 15:49.000
this is from my grandma.

15:49.208 --> 15:50.333
Please

15:51.208 --> 15:52.625
take it, keep it.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.875
I don't want to bring it back, please.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.207
Where is the exit?

16:02.208 --> 16:03.792
Oh, over there! Bye-bye!

16:10.708 --> 16:12.708
Oh my god, that's a real vampire!

16:15.708 --> 16:16.625
Tim

16:16.917 --> 16:17.958
are you okay?

16:18.208 --> 16:19.708
Please follow me.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.083
Uncle Chung

16:34.167 --> 16:35.083
Tim

16:35.084 --> 16:36.125
listen

16:36.167 --> 16:38.958
this is a secret department.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.832
You should never mention to anyone.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.583
Not even to your close family.

16:49.125 --> 16:50.625
But why are you telling me that?

16:50.708 --> 16:52.333
You will soon understand.

16:57.750 --> 16:58.625
It is time

16:58.626 --> 17:00.583
to return this house to you.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.374
Your parents

17:03.375 --> 17:05.583
were our colleagues

17:06.791 --> 17:08.500
and our Managers.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.000
Unfortunately, they'd got bitten

17:12.250 --> 17:14.791
by vampires during a mission.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.833
Your mother died right
after giving birth to you.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.500
Maybe that is the reason why

17:22.583 --> 17:26.583
you would have the immune
against the vampire toxic.

17:43.000 --> 17:43.708
Tim

17:43.792 --> 17:46.625
certainly I wish you can join our team.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.083
However if you decide not to do so,

17:49.417 --> 17:51.583
please drink this calming tea

17:51.750 --> 17:54.583
and you will forget everything
happened here today.

18:30.875 --> 18:33.708
Bring your wife back for dinner.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.708
Close the door to heaven,
open the road to Karma

18:46.042 --> 18:48.125
close the door to life,
open the door to die.

18:48.208 --> 18:49.625
Reincarnation...

18:50.125 --> 18:51.500
Done.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.083
You really think that kid will join us?

19:01.167 --> 19:02.958
He looks weak, and indeed he is weak.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.125
Have I ever misjudged anyone?

19:06.083 --> 19:07.208
And you...

19:07.500 --> 19:09.542
Never mean what you say.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.958
What...

19:11.375 --> 19:12.917
Hi, I'm Tim.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.708
Today is my first day on duty.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.125
Wow

19:17.250 --> 19:18.583
what's wrong with you?

19:21.500 --> 19:23.000
Keep sweeping-

19:27.333 --> 19:28.708
shovel up...

19:32.750 --> 19:35.583
And then discard. Idiot!

19:45.917 --> 19:48.458
When will this end...

19:54.333 --> 19:55.667
Uncle Chau, it is almost done.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.500
Shall we start the training?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.250
Sweep it again.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.250
Special reports

20:10.292 --> 20:12.791
blood moon astronomical phenomena
will appear tonight.

20:12.792 --> 20:14.332
According to the Chinese myth,

20:14.333 --> 20:16.291
blood moon is seen as a sign

20:16.292 --> 20:17.749
of bad luck.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.958
However, this saying is
not scientifically proven.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.458
Blood moon is caused by

20:26.500 --> 20:27.958
a total lunar eclipse

20:28.000 --> 20:30.416
those red light rays are aimed at the moon,

20:30.417 --> 20:32.167
giving it a reddish glow.

21:11.958 --> 21:13.042
Nice! Delicious!

21:13.083 --> 21:13.958
Kui

21:15.333 --> 21:16.791
this is my granddaughter,

21:16.792 --> 21:19.041
S-ki-ing at Canada.

21:19.042 --> 21:21.374
S-ki-ing? What's that?

21:21.375 --> 21:23.917
S-ki-ing is Skiing.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.458
You don't know English?

21:25.500 --> 21:27.875
No, I don't understand English at all.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.167
She's pretty, right?

21:29.208 --> 21:31.750
She doesn't look like your granddaughter...

21:31.792 --> 21:34.208
You look so young.
I thought she is just your daughter.

21:34.583 --> 21:35.583
Tim

21:35.792 --> 21:38.374
this book includes
different type of vampire information,

21:38.375 --> 21:40.417
and all the samples of amulets.

21:40.458 --> 21:41.917
You must read them all.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.583
Ginger, come up. We are waiting for you.

21:44.625 --> 21:45.957
Coming...

21:45.958 --> 21:47.792
You must clone the amulets sample.

21:48.292 --> 21:48.958
Okay

21:48.959 --> 21:51.124
Tim! After copying the amulets

21:51.125 --> 21:53.792
don't forget to wash our uniforms.

21:53.958 --> 21:54.708
Okay

21:54.709 --> 21:55.833
and

21:55.958 --> 21:57.875
reel back all the chalk line.

21:59.000 --> 21:59.875
Okay

22:06.875 --> 22:09.375
work...

22:09.458 --> 22:11.292
It's so messy.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.000
Copy...

22:43.875 --> 22:46.333
Copy? Snapping would just do...

22:54.125 --> 22:55.875
There is a suspect report at Sai Kung.

22:56.875 --> 22:57.957
Pack the tools...

22:57.958 --> 22:59.082
And be ready.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.582
Really spoiling...

23:00.583 --> 23:02.167
I haven't started yet.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.667
Where is Chau?

23:03.750 --> 23:04.958
Here

23:05.750 --> 23:06.917
chance for real practice...

23:06.958 --> 23:08.542
Come with us.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.375
Okay

23:21.083 --> 23:22.833
it should be here.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.917
Hey Josephine,

23:26.083 --> 23:28.708
I'm on duty right now...

23:28.833 --> 23:30.333
Talk later.

23:35.333 --> 23:36.292
Tim

23:36.875 --> 23:38.750
don't be nervous. I'll be with you.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.042
Huh?

23:41.917 --> 23:43.417
Stand behind...

23:43.667 --> 23:45.083
No heroism.

23:45.292 --> 23:46.750
Of course not.

24:02.583 --> 24:04.208
Uncle Chung, why do you look so serious?

24:04.333 --> 24:06.000
The power of "yin" is very strong.

24:06.042 --> 24:07.417
Very fierce.

24:08.917 --> 24:09.833
Hey

24:10.167 --> 24:11.667
don't rely on me.

24:16.958 --> 24:18.167
In the five elements,

24:19.083 --> 24:21.292
vampire belongs to the earth...

24:21.667 --> 24:23.792
And the earth overcomes the water.

24:24.458 --> 24:28.667
But this vampire came out from the water.

24:29.583 --> 24:31.583
It must be extraordinary.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.583
And there were two of them.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.125
Pass me the amulets.

24:37.292 --> 24:38.333
I... Don't have enough time to copy...

24:38.375 --> 24:40.542
But I can send you through the apps.

24:40.958 --> 24:42.417
Damn it!

24:44.375 --> 24:45.708
Stay here.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.125
I go checking around.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.250
Chung, let's go.

24:51.583 --> 24:52.958
Don't leave me alone!

24:53.875 --> 24:54.792
Kui

24:54.793 --> 24:58.083
come to the lake accompany with Tim.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.458
"Danger. Please do not enter"

25:06.542 --> 25:07.667
Chau

25:40.667 --> 25:42.082
sorry... I've dropped my walkie talkie...

25:42.083 --> 25:44.667
Please send me text
message instead, thanks.

26:04.083 --> 26:05.957
Are you kidding? No excuse...

26:05.958 --> 26:07.875
You must get it back.

26:10.042 --> 26:12.333
I'm not finding excuse...

26:37.625 --> 26:38.917
Uncle Chau

26:39.125 --> 26:40.582
I am trying my best...

26:40.583 --> 26:43.541
But I feel something wrong here.

26:43.542 --> 26:46.708
How about you come over and help?

26:47.667 --> 26:48.833
Thank you!

26:48.917 --> 26:51.542
It's okay now.
Someone gave it back to me. Thanks

26:56.542 --> 26:57.833
oh no...

27:01.750 --> 27:03.667
It's okay now.
Someone gave it back to me. Thanks

27:04.333 --> 27:06.707
I've told you...
The kid causes nothing but trouble.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.417
That's why I said not to hire him.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.125
I've mentioned,

27:10.167 --> 27:12.957
we're getting over
a century years old together.

27:12.958 --> 27:14.458
We are getting old.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.375
Only you are, "Uncle" Chung.

27:54.583 --> 27:58.083
Come back...!

27:59.250 --> 28:00.125
So lucky!

28:01.208 --> 28:02.083
Shit!

29:11.000 --> 29:13.333
I knew it... There's something wrong.

29:51.708 --> 29:54.542
Uncle Chau, there's a vampire.

29:54.625 --> 29:55.666
Come, help!

29:55.667 --> 29:58.042
Stop chasing. Tim's in trouble.

29:59.583 --> 30:00.999
Uncle Chau! Help me!

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Help!

30:03.708 --> 30:05.042
Help!

30:05.250 --> 30:06.958
Do not follow me!

30:12.125 --> 30:14.167
What's happening...?

30:15.792 --> 30:17.833
What's happening?

30:20.333 --> 30:23.250
What's that? Why is it coming?

30:24.167 --> 30:25.417
Don't come here!

30:32.833 --> 30:37.917
Don't bite me again...! Please...!

30:37.958 --> 30:40.208
Tim! Are you okay?

30:59.875 --> 31:01.208
Excuse me, officer Chu,

31:01.333 --> 31:02.999
actually vampires...

31:03.000 --> 31:05.125
Are just dead bodies...

31:05.250 --> 31:07.958
Get infected by a special virus...

31:08.125 --> 31:10.666
Which stimulate them to move.

31:10.667 --> 31:11.542
I see...

31:11.583 --> 31:13.917
- Proof it.
- Yes sir!

31:13.958 --> 31:18.333
As long as I can collect
the infected sample,

31:18.708 --> 31:21.374
I would develop the vaccine.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.125
Tackle the vampires.

31:24.208 --> 31:25.208
Kui

31:25.250 --> 31:26.291
Tim almost died

31:26.292 --> 31:27.792
because you didn't listen
to the walkie talkie.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.167
Not again, trouble's never stopped.

31:33.750 --> 31:35.125
I'd deal with it.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.083
How are you? Officer ch...

31:38.208 --> 31:39.917
Anything I can help?

31:39.958 --> 31:41.333
You guys again...

31:41.500 --> 31:44.125
Please inform us
before taking any action, could you?

31:44.583 --> 31:46.208
Why? We're just doing our job.

31:46.458 --> 31:48.000
But you guys are civil servants...

31:48.042 --> 31:49.750
There are guidelines to follow.

31:49.875 --> 31:51.458
A villager's just reported about this...

31:51.500 --> 31:54.208
What do you think I should tell the media?

31:54.292 --> 31:56.792
It's good to you.
You have another chance to show-off.

31:56.875 --> 31:57.792
See...

31:57.875 --> 31:59.167
My boss is calling...

31:59.208 --> 32:00.750
For my explanation.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.125
Now

32:03.292 --> 32:04.250
what are you doing?

32:04.333 --> 32:05.750
Explained.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.583
Stop teasing me...

32:08.125 --> 32:11.292
Our research department
is doing scientific experiment.

32:11.458 --> 32:12.625
Once approved,

32:12.750 --> 32:14.833
we'll overtake your whole department.

32:19.917 --> 32:22.042
You get what you want
and I get back to work.

32:22.542 --> 32:24.499
Steven, go search for
evidences and samples.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.833
No problem.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.417
Yes, over there.

32:28.958 --> 32:30.042
Officer Chu...

32:30.875 --> 32:32.374
Villagers have reported that...

32:32.375 --> 32:34.542
They saw a Wack around.

32:34.625 --> 32:35.875
The definition of a Wack...

32:35.917 --> 32:37.832
Is a debatable topic in the society.

32:37.833 --> 32:40.875
We will seek for consultant
from the department of justice...

32:40.958 --> 32:42.458
Yes, search over there.

32:42.708 --> 32:43.708
Officer Chu...

32:43.792 --> 32:45.292
I find something.

32:50.958 --> 32:54.125
Summer Yik, born in 1820,

32:54.250 --> 32:55.707
died in 1841.

32:55.708 --> 32:57.041
Summer

32:57.042 --> 32:59.417
close the door to heaven.
Open the door to Karma.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.916
Close the door to life.
Open the road to death.

33:01.917 --> 33:03.625
Reincarnation.

33:03.667 --> 33:06.000
At least 100 years ago...

33:06.667 --> 33:08.292
Oxtail village...

33:08.333 --> 33:09.875
Where was it?

33:10.375 --> 33:11.625
Hundred years ago,

33:11.667 --> 33:14.624
while Hong Kong was still
a part of a mainland district.

33:14.625 --> 33:17.124
This lake was a land.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.582
Where oxtail village was located.

33:18.583 --> 33:20.791
The coffin and the burial goods...

33:20.792 --> 33:23.291
Indicated that the vampire
should be a landlord.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.125
And the lady vampire was
one of the burial goods.

33:26.208 --> 33:28.291
According to the scratches on the coffin,

33:28.292 --> 33:30.042
I believe she was buried alive.

33:30.833 --> 33:34.291
This girl can finally escape
from the landlord after a hundred years.

33:34.292 --> 33:35.917
Poor girl.

33:36.625 --> 33:38.249
The death of the grave robber shows...

33:38.250 --> 33:41.125
The landlord vampire is
in the "dry condition".

33:41.958 --> 33:43.582
After sucking enough blood,

33:43.583 --> 33:45.000
it will spread virus.

33:45.042 --> 33:47.541
I assume that this lady vampire

33:47.542 --> 33:50.124
had a bonding with the landlord vampire.

33:50.125 --> 33:51.417
So...

33:51.458 --> 33:52.957
I'm worrying that...

33:52.958 --> 33:55.374
She might signal the landlord vampire
over the public.

33:55.375 --> 33:57.541
We'd better cremate her
as soon as possible,

33:57.542 --> 34:00.041
cut the bonding between the two vampires.

34:00.042 --> 34:01.458
- Tim
- yes

34:01.667 --> 34:04.417
clean the vampire with a piece of cloth.

34:04.875 --> 34:08.042
Let it go decently.

34:08.750 --> 34:10.917
Don't you wear glasses?

34:13.125 --> 34:14.208
Yes, I am.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.708
Uncle Chung! She is crying!

34:49.292 --> 34:50.375
What?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.831
She... She is crying. Tear's coming out...

34:52.833 --> 34:54.000
Crying?

34:55.875 --> 34:57.042
Look.

34:58.042 --> 35:01.083
That's the water drops
from the air-conditioner.

35:02.750 --> 35:03.667
There is signal.

35:07.833 --> 35:09.875
Uncle Chau, shall I... Go?

35:11.292 --> 35:13.375
Stay here, stop causing trouble.

35:14.375 --> 35:15.667
Tim

35:15.917 --> 35:18.042
when the bell rings,

35:18.083 --> 35:20.042
you move the vampire inside.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.250
I... I move?

35:30.542 --> 35:31.542
Sorry...

35:31.625 --> 35:32.917
I know it's a bit hot.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.042
Stop crying, you will get used to it.

35:39.583 --> 35:40.625
Excuse me...

36:00.333 --> 36:01.250
Hello...

36:01.250 --> 36:02.125
Hello...

36:45.208 --> 36:47.249
I'm sorry... I just want...

36:47.250 --> 36:48.833
to take back my mobile.

36:52.583 --> 36:54.250
It's not my fault! No!

37:32.000 --> 37:33.375
Please go back.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.082
Go... Get in.

37:36.083 --> 37:37.957
Oh yes, come over here

37:37.958 --> 37:38.999
yes...

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Come...

37:41.958 --> 37:43.374
Lie down

37:43.375 --> 37:44.542
get in

37:46.458 --> 37:48.042
lie down here and get in.

37:48.792 --> 37:50.458
Lie down and get in.

37:56.583 --> 37:57.708
Lie down.

37:59.875 --> 38:00.833
Get inside.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.333
Go...

38:04.875 --> 38:06.458
Inside...

38:09.167 --> 38:11.458
Lie down here...

38:13.000 --> 38:14.792
Help yourself and goodbye.

38:16.542 --> 38:18.750
Stop following me!

38:57.042 --> 38:58.750
Stay away

39:23.958 --> 39:24.875
what's happened?

39:25.542 --> 39:26.542
Shit!

39:26.875 --> 39:28.166
Come down...!

39:28.167 --> 39:29.957
What are you doing? Come down or...

39:29.958 --> 39:30.999
We will be in trouble...

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Come down...!

39:36.458 --> 39:38.167
Summer...

39:41.042 --> 39:43.375
Summer...

39:43.667 --> 39:44.791
Jump...

39:44.792 --> 39:45.875
Jump down...

39:46.167 --> 39:47.791

39:47.792 --> 39:48.832
jump down

39:48.833 --> 39:50.166

- Excuse me...

39:50.167 --> 39:51.792
What are you doing with my car?

39:52.375 --> 39:54.124
Quickly... Summer...

39:54.125 --> 39:55.042
Summer

39:58.750 --> 39:59.958
- I'm so sorry.
- Excuse me...

40:00.958 --> 40:02.292
What is she doing on the roof?

40:04.500 --> 40:06.333
I'm sorry. My girlfriend is drunk.

40:06.875 --> 40:07.957
Excuse me... But

40:07.958 --> 40:09.957
how could she climb up
there if she was drunk?

40:09.958 --> 40:12.542
I'm sorry, but she's come down, right?

40:12.583 --> 40:14.458
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you guys?

40:14.542 --> 40:15.832
Not at all... We're sorry indeed.

40:15.833 --> 40:17.542
Let's go and say goodbye

40:17.583 --> 40:19.792
- I'm sorry...
- We're sorry...

40:20.208 --> 40:21.333
Excuse us...

40:21.667 --> 40:26.083
Summer...

40:27.333 --> 40:31.375
Summer... Summer...

40:37.292 --> 40:38.416
Excuse us... Dad.

40:38.417 --> 40:40.333
I just want to store something for temp...

41:12.917 --> 41:14.417
Coming...

41:14.625 --> 41:15.833
What's wrong with you?

41:21.917 --> 41:23.999
According to the scratches on the coffin,

41:24.000 --> 41:25.833
she was buried alive.

41:28.667 --> 41:32.583
Master! She is coming with you.

41:35.792 --> 41:38.083
Sor... Sorry.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.125
Come out...

42:47.125 --> 42:48.667
Sit down.

43:10.917 --> 43:12.583
So you watch the TV programme.

43:12.750 --> 43:14.208
I am going out for a while.

43:14.500 --> 43:15.833
I will be back soon.

43:16.458 --> 43:18.083
Sit tight. Stay here.

43:47.083 --> 43:48.166
White vampire.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.041
Corpse runs out of blood suddenly,

43:50.042 --> 43:52.041
which stimulates the vampire power.

43:52.042 --> 43:53.250
It will become white in colour.

43:53.333 --> 43:55.292
Moving slowly, easy to be caught.

43:57.333 --> 43:58.625
Cunning vampire.

43:58.958 --> 44:00.374
Intelligent.

44:00.375 --> 44:03.583
Prey with cheats.

44:05.167 --> 44:06.542
Dry vampire.

44:07.125 --> 44:10.708
Transformed with grievance. Very powerful.

44:10.750 --> 44:13.917
Will suck in blood of the prey completely.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.583
Human vampire

44:24.250 --> 44:25.999
mutated vampire.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.833
Might revive human emotion
with some unknown conditions...

44:31.750 --> 44:33.250
No further information...

44:33.375 --> 44:35.667
Very rare species.

44:39.625 --> 44:41.583
Vampire defense class

44:42.833 --> 44:44.292
to tackle vampires,

44:44.458 --> 44:46.708
defense is prior to attack.

44:46.833 --> 44:49.582
If we're bitten by a vampire,

44:49.583 --> 44:51.875
the mission is over.

44:53.208 --> 44:54.333
These“.

44:54.375 --> 44:58.208
Are the tools that we
use to catch vampires.

44:58.292 --> 44:59.583
Especially this...

44:59.625 --> 45:01.083
Vest is...

45:01.833 --> 45:03.667
Fashion and functional

45:04.375 --> 45:05.874
when we are on normal duty,

45:05.875 --> 45:07.208
it's just a uniform.

45:07.500 --> 45:08.833
Once we are in a mission...

45:09.583 --> 45:11.458
It becomes a secret weapon.

45:12.333 --> 45:14.042
Vampire theory class

45:14.792 --> 45:17.833
Cinnabar contains the integration
of the earth's Yang energy.

45:17.875 --> 45:19.582
So the amulet

45:19.583 --> 45:23.250
must be drawn by Cinnabar
to generate the maximum Mana.

45:23.542 --> 45:25.333
Let me illustrate to you now.

45:26.042 --> 45:27.167
Keep sweeping...

45:31.208 --> 45:32.417
Shovel up...

45:34.667 --> 45:35.708
Then discard...

45:36.917 --> 45:38.707
Sweep again afterwards.

45:38.708 --> 45:41.166
If a vampire try to attack you,

45:41.167 --> 45:44.416
in most cases, you'd not have time
to collect weapons.

45:44.417 --> 45:45.916
In this situation... Be concentrated!

45:45.917 --> 45:47.499
In this situation,

45:47.500 --> 45:49.042
what would you do?

45:51.625 --> 45:52.542
Elbow attack.

45:52.542 --> 45:53.542
Come on.

45:54.750 --> 45:56.542
It hurts!

45:57.000 --> 45:59.583
One trick only? Any others?

46:00.458 --> 46:02.167
- Step your feet.
- Do it.

46:02.958 --> 46:04.833
It really hurts!

46:05.125 --> 46:06.416
Not again please...

46:06.417 --> 46:08.124
The only way to tackle it...

46:08.125 --> 46:09.916
Is to hold its chin

46:09.917 --> 46:11.666
immediately.

46:11.667 --> 46:14.042
Don't let it open its mouth.

46:17.542 --> 46:18.875
Keep sweeping-

46:23.542 --> 46:25.000
Uncle Chau, watch out!

46:29.667 --> 46:31.208
Shovel up,

46:32.458 --> 46:34.167
and discard.

46:38.042 --> 46:39.333
Done!

46:42.417 --> 46:43.708
Start again.

46:45.917 --> 46:48.541
There are several types of amulet:

46:48.542 --> 46:50.832
Controlling amulet, freezing amulet

46:50.833 --> 46:52.833
eliminating amulet.

47:06.208 --> 47:07.958
- Understand?
- Yes.

47:10.042 --> 47:12.874
Eliminating amulet must be used with care.

47:12.875 --> 47:14.499
Otherwise the vampire

47:14.500 --> 47:16.249
can never reincarnate.

47:16.250 --> 47:17.583
Got it?

47:30.875 --> 47:32.499
He is tired. Let him take a rest.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.582
No.

47:33.583 --> 47:35.417
We're getting old, lack of time.

47:35.792 --> 47:37.249
Wake up!

47:37.250 --> 47:38.667
Are you finished training?

47:38.708 --> 47:39.875
Keep training...

47:40.375 --> 47:41.458
Training...

47:45.167 --> 47:46.917
I've done all the tasks already.

47:48.458 --> 47:49.875
No please...

47:52.250 --> 47:53.792
You have a new task now.

47:56.792 --> 47:58.207
- Uncle Chau...
- Stop.

47:58.208 --> 47:59.750
Just do it.

48:01.625 --> 48:03.124
Sweep...

48:03.125 --> 48:04.875
Mumbling what!

48:05.958 --> 48:07.541
I'm hereto learn catching vampire...

48:07.542 --> 48:08.832
But not sweeping floor.

48:08.833 --> 48:09.833
I can do that at home.

48:09.834 --> 48:11.083
Sweeping»-

48:15.417 --> 48:16.832
you want to learn catching vampires.

48:16.833 --> 48:17.833
I teach you now.

48:17.834 --> 48:19.042
Come on. Take it.

48:22.292 --> 48:23.750
Don't you say take it?

48:24.500 --> 48:25.333
Sweep!

48:27.750 --> 48:28.750
I was learning hard...

48:28.750 --> 48:29.750
Sweep again.

48:31.333 --> 48:32.292
Hold the elbow.

48:32.333 --> 48:33.667
Push with forearm.

48:33.833 --> 48:35.208
Foot-stepping tight.

48:36.375 --> 48:37.292
Try again.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.042
Sweep!

48:46.250 --> 48:47.542
Come come... Come

48:50.583 --> 48:51.708
- shovel
- huh? Shovel?

48:57.125 --> 48:58.457
Be concentrated...

48:58.458 --> 48:59.917
Don't under-estimate the vampire.

48:59.958 --> 49:00.917
Discard.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.374
Never let the vampire stand behind you.

49:08.375 --> 49:09.833
Try again.

49:41.208 --> 49:42.458
Remember.

49:44.083 --> 49:45.083
Vampires.

49:46.125 --> 49:47.917
Never let them go away.

49:53.333 --> 49:54.917
If you don't kill them,

49:55.625 --> 49:56.917
they will kill you instead.

50:00.125 --> 50:01.500
Killing me?

50:06.042 --> 50:07.667
Might be not?

50:24.875 --> 50:25.917
What?

50:31.000 --> 50:32.958
You like blood Jello Congee?

50:34.875 --> 50:36.333
Want a bite?

50:41.917 --> 50:42.958
Sit down first.

50:50.125 --> 50:51.249
Hey...

50:51.250 --> 50:52.458
Behave“.

50:56.958 --> 50:58.708
Use a spoon...

51:03.917 --> 51:05.583
So dirty.

51:07.292 --> 51:08.750
You want to learn smiling...?

51:09.792 --> 51:11.208
Curve up you lips...

51:14.083 --> 51:15.874
With a "hehe" sound.

51:15.875 --> 51:17.625
Hehe“.

51:27.958 --> 51:31.958
May I help you?

51:34.542 --> 51:35.832
What's your name?

51:35.833 --> 51:38.916
I'm sivi. Nice to meet you.

51:38.917 --> 51:40.542
Aren't you called, summer?

51:40.583 --> 51:42.749
Okay, if you insist.

51:42.750 --> 51:44.583
Hi, summer.

51:47.250 --> 51:48.832
What are you actually?

51:48.833 --> 51:50.917
I'm a friend of you.

51:57.542 --> 51:58.791
Am I handsome?

51:58.792 --> 52:00.583
Super handsome.

52:44.500 --> 52:45.292
Sor... Sorry...

52:45.333 --> 52:46.250
Promise, not again...

52:46.251 --> 52:47.749
- Sor... Sorry.
- It's okay.

52:47.750 --> 52:50.292
Work harder. Keep it up.

52:54.250 --> 52:57.125
Keep it up. You can do it.

53:04.792 --> 53:06.458
Catch you finally.

53:06.542 --> 53:07.667
- Look up
- what?

53:10.167 --> 53:11.125
Hey...

53:11.750 --> 53:13.208
Slow down.

53:17.208 --> 53:18.457
Vampire catching:

53:18.458 --> 53:19.916
Speed is key.

53:19.917 --> 53:21.625
Be as fast as possible.

53:33.125 --> 53:34.417
Well done.

53:38.625 --> 53:40.208
Satisfied with the service?

53:40.417 --> 53:42.124
Click this. It is called Skype.

53:42.125 --> 53:43.749
Wow! So clear.

53:43.750 --> 53:45.625
Yup! Say hi to each other.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.583
Am I level upped? Uncle Chau.

53:50.667 --> 53:51.916
Barely acceptable.

53:51.917 --> 53:54.624
Fighting with a vampire
requires you to react

53:54.625 --> 53:55.500
fast.

53:55.501 --> 53:56.792
Uncle Chau, you're playing the trick?

54:28.583 --> 54:30.792
Can you keep quiet!

55:17.667 --> 55:18.917
Uncle ginger.

55:19.333 --> 55:21.500
Are there any other option
instead of killing?

55:21.542 --> 55:23.250
Life or death

55:23.500 --> 55:24.749
are all fate.

55:24.750 --> 55:28.042
Human being have their fate,
vampires are the same.

55:28.250 --> 55:31.500
Vampires will become harmful
if they detain in our world.

55:31.542 --> 55:33.666
They can't reincarnate.

55:33.667 --> 55:35.708
Already pity enough.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.916
We help them to have
salvation and reincarnation,

55:37.917 --> 55:40.708
which is a good deed for them.

55:41.833 --> 55:43.625
Aren't there other way-out?

55:44.958 --> 55:46.917
Now you are not a human, nor a vampire.

55:47.625 --> 55:51.000
Your fate is on your hand.

56:06.458 --> 56:08.042
Pull it down.

56:08.833 --> 56:11.292
Put in your left hand as well.

56:12.333 --> 56:13.250
Okay?

57:09.208 --> 57:10.042
Uncle Chau

57:10.043 --> 57:11.750
why are we working at daytime?

57:11.833 --> 57:13.292
Is there vampire?

57:15.250 --> 57:17.500
Little wa, watch the steps.

57:21.375 --> 57:22.917
- Hi Chau
- hi

57:25.667 --> 57:27.125
you are very thoughtful. Chau.

57:27.167 --> 57:28.917
Oh wait...

57:29.625 --> 57:32.583
Buy an ice-cream for the
little girl as well.

57:34.417 --> 57:35.791
Her grandpa always said that...

57:35.792 --> 57:39.124
He wanted to see her growing up well...

57:39.125 --> 57:41.041
But there's something cannot be expected.

57:41.042 --> 57:43.582
Don't worry Chau.
I promise there will be a decent funeral.

57:43.583 --> 57:44.666
Thank you.

57:44.667 --> 57:46.000
I am going back to work.

57:48.417 --> 57:50.958
- That old scavenger?
- Yes.

58:09.542 --> 58:11.207
For a period of time,
I thought catching vampires

58:11.208 --> 58:12.874
is helping people.

58:12.875 --> 58:14.542
Feeling good.

58:16.750 --> 58:18.917
You are right, in some sense.

58:22.875 --> 58:26.792
But sometimes I'm not sure
if it's really helping others...

58:26.875 --> 58:28.417
My friends...

58:28.750 --> 58:31.417
- Run! Chau!
- Or myself.

58:34.500 --> 58:36.875
No one were actually saved.

58:37.625 --> 58:40.333
I'm always insecure if the next mission

58:40.792 --> 58:43.000
would be my last one.

58:43.875 --> 58:45.125
Ling!

58:47.458 --> 58:48.250
Tim

58:50.750 --> 58:52.792
it is our job nature.

58:54.750 --> 58:56.542
Grandma is getting old.

58:56.833 --> 58:58.583
If she has any wish,

58:59.250 --> 59:01.292
you'd better satisfy her with your best.

59:01.833 --> 59:03.917
Do you understand what I mean?

59:24.250 --> 59:26.291
Listen summer, you pretend
to be my girlfriend.

59:26.292 --> 59:28.416
Whatever my grandma says,
you just have to...

59:28.417 --> 59:29.458
Smile

59:29.500 --> 59:30.541
and nod.

59:30.542 --> 59:32.332
One more, if I speak the word...

59:32.333 --> 59:33.542
Give

59:33.917 --> 59:36.207
then you should give this bag to grandma.

59:36.208 --> 59:38.000
Okay?

59:43.875 --> 59:45.875
What's wrong with me here...?

59:48.208 --> 59:50.125
I must be insane.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.583
Lun.

01:00:05.833 --> 01:00:07.292
My daughter-in-law.

01:00:09.292 --> 01:00:12.292
It's good to see you back!
Let's have dinner together.

01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:15.500
Long time not seeing
you, my daughter-in-law.

01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:27.625
Daughter-in-law,

01:00:27.626 --> 01:00:29.417
you haven't eaten much?

01:00:32.125 --> 01:00:33.707
Oh yes...

01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:35.292
She is not feeling well.

01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:36.458
Vomit all the time.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.917
- Vomit?
- Yes, she does.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.125
You vomit?

01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:43.333
Daughter-in-law,

01:00:43.334 --> 01:00:44.833
I'm not being annoying.

01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:47.292
Frankly, there is

01:00:47.583 --> 01:00:49.166
only one boy left...

01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:50.958
In our family.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:53.625
Do you get what I mean?

01:00:56.833 --> 01:00:58.625
You two have make love, right?

01:01:00.625 --> 01:01:02.292
Great!

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.458
Certainly not using condom?

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:08.583
- Stop nodding please.
- Bingo!

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.333
For me,

01:01:11.458 --> 01:01:12.582
honestly,

01:01:12.583 --> 01:01:14.499
I'd like the first baby to be a boy.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.542
No...

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.374
You guess it'd be a boy or a girl?

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:19.957
Don't touch her tummy.

01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:23.167
Sivi: I can't answer you right now.

01:01:25.958 --> 01:01:27.875
I can understand...

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.542
Secret...

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:37.291
I've prepared the name
for my grandchild already...

01:01:37.292 --> 01:01:38.875
It's called,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.957
Tim Cheung.

01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:43.708
I'm already that Tim Cheung.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:53.292
My grandma haven't been
such happy for a long time.

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:57.417
Hey. Where are you going?

01:01:57.875 --> 01:01:59.874
No rushing... Be patient...

01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:02.208
Okay. Seats will be available soon.

01:02:02.792 --> 01:02:03.958
You may go inside.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.167
- We are together.
- No problem...

01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:08.500
Excuse me, madam.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:10.082
Please queue up. I give you a ticket.

01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:11.624
- Boss.
- Everyone is queuing up here.

01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:13.791
Hey, who-ever...

01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:14.667
Tim.

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:16.374
Huh... Whoever

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:18.291
never-mind. Why is it so crowded here?

01:02:18.292 --> 01:02:19.874
Nothing.

01:02:19.875 --> 01:02:22.874
I was planning to close down
the restaurant the other day,

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:25.916
unexpectedly, lots of journalists
came to ask for interviews,

01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:29.125
claimed that they want to keep such...
Old featured restaurant.

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:30.457
I've an idea.

01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:32.082
I'd announce closing everyday from now on.

01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:34.417
- Then I will make a big fortune.
- Boss.

01:02:42.417 --> 01:02:44.167
Do you want it?

01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:52.292
You want to learn walking, aren't you?

01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:06.917
Let me teach you...

01:04:07.042 --> 01:04:08.583
Step-by-step...

01:04:08.917 --> 01:04:10.167
Walking forward...

01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:11.792
Slowly.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.667
Raise one leg...

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:17.625
Forward...

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:19.292
To make a step.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.083
The next...

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.167
One.

01:04:46.042 --> 01:04:47.333
Watch out!

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.292
Come on.

01:05:32.125 --> 01:05:33.458
Hey...

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.542
Excuse me...

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.125
Hey...

01:06:09.208 --> 01:06:11.832
Thundering frame with electricity power...

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:13.457
Joining together...

01:06:13.458 --> 01:06:15.250
Being unbeatable!

01:06:15.292 --> 01:06:17.124
Come on. Do not hesitate.

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:19.250
You might miss the right timing.

01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:30.125
Examination soon.

01:06:30.292 --> 01:06:31.874
Whether or not you can join us...

01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.792
All depends on your performance.

01:06:34.917 --> 01:06:36.542
To be honest,

01:06:36.917 --> 01:06:39.375
I didn't want you to be
involved at the beginning.

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:43.792
Your dad is dead because of me.

01:06:51.458 --> 01:06:54.250
Please help me to take care of him.

01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:09.875
Hold this broom firmly.

01:07:11.167 --> 01:07:11.917
It belongs to you now.

01:07:11.917 --> 01:07:12.625
"Tim"

01:07:12.958 --> 01:07:14.625
treat it with treasure.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:25.458
Yes, master.

01:07:35.958 --> 01:07:36.792
Tim

01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:40.042
your examination task...
Is to kill this vampire.

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:42.083
Kill... Killing a vampire?

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:40.375
Tim

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:42.207
take your sword out.

01:08:45.207 --> 01:08:46.332
Excuse me...

01:08:46.625 --> 01:08:48.375
I would like to show you that...

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.292
Killing is not a must.

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:13.542
Tim.

01:09:14.207 --> 01:09:15.332
Kill it.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.625
Master...

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:21.957
No helping.

01:09:24.457 --> 01:09:25.917
Don't...

01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:40.000
He's in real danger... Chau.

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:13.333
Master.

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:14.958
Summer's got humanity now.

01:10:15.042 --> 01:10:17.624
- Behave.
- Are you okay?

01:10:17.625 --> 01:10:19.875
Are you mad? She is a vampire
and you're protecting her!

01:10:19.917 --> 01:10:21.582
She gradually becomes human
being after sucking my blood.

01:10:21.583 --> 01:10:23.582
So what? You want to
give her all your blood?

01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:25.167
Come on, master.

01:10:25.708 --> 01:10:26.667
No.

01:10:26.917 --> 01:10:28.792
Signal again... You two
go and check it out.

01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:30.332
Ginger, settle this vampire...

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:31.458
We go hospital together.

01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:35.917
- Summer.
- Stop.

01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:38.042
Pack your weapon and come with me.

01:10:40.125 --> 01:10:41.292
Ginger.

01:10:41.375 --> 01:10:42.625
I beg you...

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.917
Do not terminate summer.

01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:47.375
I know what to do.

01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:53.583
Master.

01:11:01.833 --> 01:11:02.999
Please listen to me.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.042
Master.

01:11:06.292 --> 01:11:07.583
I'm not your master.

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:10.500
You're completely mad.

01:11:10.708 --> 01:11:12.457
Vampire killed your dad.

01:11:12.458 --> 01:11:14.041
I've resisted your joining us
at the beginning...

01:11:14.042 --> 01:11:15.291
Because I'm not willing
to put you in danger.

01:11:15.292 --> 01:11:17.125
And violate the promise to your dad.

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:18.708
What have you just done?

01:11:19.125 --> 01:11:20.457
Not only reject to kill a vampire

01:11:20.458 --> 01:11:21.791
but hiding one of them instead.

01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:23.625
Killing is not a must...

01:11:24.125 --> 01:11:25.291
And summer,

01:11:25.292 --> 01:11:26.666
she is different.

01:11:26.667 --> 01:11:27.583
Just give her some time,

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:28.749
- you'd feel it...
- No exception.

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:29.958
No more excuse.

01:11:30.458 --> 01:11:32.042
- Give me back the sword.
- Master.

01:11:33.417 --> 01:11:36.292
Government department do not allow disobey.

01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.041
He is angry to blind now.

01:11:47.042 --> 01:11:48.458
You go back first.

01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:50.333
Kui! Get on the truck!

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.625
Get it there...

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.000
Stay still.

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:14.292
What?

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:15.833
Anti-amulet vampire...?

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:18.250
Everything is possible.

01:12:32.542 --> 01:12:35.667
It is such a big area. Where shall we go?

01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:39.750
OMG!

01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:50.708
Stop filming. Run.

01:12:52.583 --> 01:12:54.582
The "Sai Kung cannibalism" video
is circulating over the Internet

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:56.833
and boomed at the public discussion.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.749
Some experts believe that
the behavior of the suspect...

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:05.333
Is probably caused by
a serious mental illness or drug addiction.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:12.292
The police had formed
a special action team for this case.

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:23.499
Kui, tidy up quickly-

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.708
the police are arriving soon.

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:31.958
Action.

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.457
- What's happening?
- Read it yourself.

01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:38.707
Your department is
taken over by the police force.

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:40.374
Cordon lining up and taking action.

01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:43.000
Reported by Siu-Sin Yip at HK Broadcast TV.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.292
Let's go.

01:14:11.292 --> 01:14:12.749
Don't bring her out from here.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:15.583
Or the landlord vampire
will be attracted to the town.

01:14:39.917 --> 01:14:40.999
Breaking news

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.916
huge police force was deployed
to blockade Kowloon city Plaza.

01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:47.457
It is probably related to
the "Sai Kung cannibalism" case.

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:48.708
As we can see,

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.624
police is moving a coffin into the mall.

01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:54.167
No responses were recorded on the spot.

01:14:54.458 --> 01:14:55.957
For further information please wait
for the upcoming report...

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:56.958
Grandma.

01:14:56.958 --> 01:14:57.875
Where is my bag-pack?

01:14:57.876 --> 01:14:59.583
On the bench.

01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:03.292
Minnan: Unemployed pretended to be working.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.875
Minnan: Single claimed
to be in a relationship.

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:08.500
Minnan: Perfect eyesight
but wearing eye-glasses.

01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:10.417
Minnan: Full of lies.

01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:13.082
Sorry grandma. I have no idea
what you are talking about.

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:15.082
There is an emergency. Talk later.

01:15:15.083 --> 01:15:16.250
Tim.

01:15:16.333 --> 01:15:19.542
I'm not... Your son... Wait?

01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:25.042
What have you just called me?

01:15:27.792 --> 01:15:28.999
Grandma.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.249
Can I sweep it later?

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:32.000
Take off your glasses.

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:34.958
Look properly.

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:37.666
What you see...

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:39.207
Is what you think.

01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:40.416
<i>"Hun"</i>

01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:42.083
how do you see the truth

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.292
is all determined by yourself.

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:47.375
If you want to change the world,

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.625
you'd have to make effort.

01:15:50.167 --> 01:15:51.333
Tim

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:52.458
keep it up-

01:15:52.583 --> 01:15:54.667
rescue daughter-in-law.

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:20.957
I'd prepared myself for this...

01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:22.750
By the time I stepped in.

01:16:46.542 --> 01:16:48.875
You want to dump me behind?

01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:56.916
Dear all, for the latest development
on this situation...

01:16:56.917 --> 01:16:58.917
We have nothing more to explode.

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:12.874
Pc28210 is calling the headquarter...

01:17:12.875 --> 01:17:14.332
From Kowloon city Plaza.

01:17:14.333 --> 01:17:15.667
A big trouble...

01:17:16.792 --> 01:17:17.625
Hi officer...

01:17:17.708 --> 01:17:20.667
Drink this... And it will calm you down.

01:17:24.875 --> 01:17:26.542
Right?

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:28.375
Thank you so much

01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:31.583
pc28210, what's happened?

01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:34.708
Nothing, everything's fine. Over.

01:17:38.875 --> 01:17:41.292
Officer, so now you know who I am.

01:17:43.333 --> 01:17:45.207
Definitely... Not.

01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:46.916
You've spoken a lot,
but I can understand nothing.

01:17:46.917 --> 01:17:49.083
I just know I'm very tired.

01:17:49.292 --> 01:17:50.375
You may consider,

01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:52.124
repeat it all over again...

01:17:52.125 --> 01:17:53.874
To explain who you are.

01:17:53.875 --> 01:17:55.832
You're tired and you still want to listen?

01:17:55.833 --> 01:17:57.499
You didn't speak very well...

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.208
You're... Officer Lee.

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.083
What's up?

01:18:01.084 --> 01:18:02.750
Who's your department head?

01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:05.916
You have your head and I have my head.

01:18:05.917 --> 01:18:07.916
My head is bigger than your head,

01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:10.375
and yours is definitely smaller than mine.

01:18:10.417 --> 01:18:11.625
Are you clear?

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:13.041
Not really.

01:18:13.042 --> 01:18:15.582
Your head is yours. My head is mine.

01:18:15.583 --> 01:18:17.124
How come your head can
be compared with mine?

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:18.999
Look at my head... And
your head is wrapped.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.124
Your head belongs to you,
my head belongs to me.

01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:23.750
How can I understand? He...

01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:26.332
What a cheat...?

01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:28.041
You... You and him...

01:18:28.042 --> 01:18:29.000
Damn...

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.624
Guys, be smart!

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.041
Hold the guns properly.

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:37.332
Tied her firmly,
and kill the other vampire later on.

01:18:37.333 --> 01:18:39.541
Fill in a guard over there.

01:18:39.542 --> 01:18:42.000
You guys keep alert at the high position.

01:19:08.333 --> 01:19:09.707
We team up eventually.

01:19:09.708 --> 01:19:10.999
We should take action immediately.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Split-up.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:12.875
Yes madam.

01:19:13.542 --> 01:19:16.833
Those on the second floor. Be smarter!

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:20.333
There should be one more guard.

01:19:36.625 --> 01:19:37.917
It's me...

01:19:37.958 --> 01:19:40.583
I come to rescue you. Wait for a moment.

01:19:44.667 --> 01:19:45.999
Hey you, come here.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.167
Yes, you.

01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:48.875
Come down here.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.292
Yes I am talking to you. Come.

01:19:52.792 --> 01:19:55.166
I forget to bring my goggle. Lend me yours.

01:19:55.167 --> 01:19:56.708
Quickly.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.582
It's said that the commander
do not need wearing goggle.

01:20:00.583 --> 01:20:02.083
- I do... Give it to me.
- In addition

01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:05.166
the media will not capture your
handsome face if you're wearing goggle.

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.041
I'll take it off by then.

01:20:07.042 --> 01:20:10.083
I don't want the mask. I want the goggle.

01:20:10.917 --> 01:20:13.582
You are the sweeper kid, aren't you?

01:20:13.583 --> 01:20:14.916
I recognize your face...

01:20:14.917 --> 01:20:17.375
- Wow...
- What?

01:20:19.917 --> 01:20:21.874
Stop kidding.

01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:24.417
You break into this mall
without a permission.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.833
- I can grab you anytime...
- Listen to me.

01:20:26.917 --> 01:20:29.416
Please follow me. It is dangerous here.
I would protect you.

01:20:29.417 --> 01:20:31.166
- I don't need your protection.
- Come on let's go.

01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:33.083
You don't have a permission... Here...

01:20:33.167 --> 01:20:35.250
What? Plasma props?

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:39.083
Run!

01:20:44.458 --> 01:20:47.167
- Fire! Open fire!
- Don't shoot him!

01:20:47.667 --> 01:20:49.625
Keep shooting!

01:20:58.667 --> 01:21:00.041
Really useless!

01:21:00.042 --> 01:21:01.875
- Let me do it.
- No

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.417
oops.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.083
Dismiss...

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:12.166
Wow...

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.125
No... It hurts...

01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:16.750
- Help... Help me.
- Run!

01:21:25.167 --> 01:21:26.750
Master.

01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:49.667
I'm paralyzed! It is narcotic.

01:21:54.833 --> 01:21:57.125
Freeze...

01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:13.083
This time... Amulets are actually useless.

01:22:34.125 --> 01:22:35.958
Your sword...?

01:22:36.292 --> 01:22:39.667
<i>"Hun"</i>

01:22:41.167 --> 01:22:42.749
are you ready?

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.542
Waiting for you.

01:22:47.458 --> 01:22:48.958
Pick!

01:22:49.292 --> 01:22:50.625
Sweep!

01:22:51.625 --> 01:22:52.833
Hand-print!

01:23:06.625 --> 01:23:07.833
Tim!

01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:23.333
Uncle Chung

01:23:23.542 --> 01:23:25.041
Sunfise

01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:28.333
pull it up. I go get the sunlight in.

01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:48.583
Chau, grab the dart.

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:54.042
Kui! Collect the chalk box.

01:23:55.917 --> 01:23:57.083
Tim.

01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:01.583
Ginger.

01:24:09.292 --> 01:24:10.292
Master.

01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:20.917
Pull up!

01:24:35.167 --> 01:24:37.875
Don't worry about me. Keep pulling!

01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:06.708
Summer, let it go!

01:25:20.458 --> 01:25:21.833
Summer...

01:25:42.208 --> 01:25:45.332
Summer...

01:25:45.333 --> 01:25:47.917
Don't worry...

01:25:47.958 --> 01:25:49.542
You will be fine.

01:25:56.125 --> 01:25:57.042
You'll be fine...

01:25:57.043 --> 01:25:59.249
No... No

01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:00.583
summer

01:26:08.667 --> 01:26:10.542
bite me, bite my arm.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.250
Try biting it...

01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:46.167
Let me transfer some
"Yang" energy to you...

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:05.125
Summer!

01:27:20.333 --> 01:27:23.708
Sivi: Keep it up. You can do it.

01:27:26.958 --> 01:27:28.124
Here is the in-charge person...

01:27:28.125 --> 01:27:30.332
Why is there vampire inside?

01:27:30.333 --> 01:27:31.791
What's happened?

01:27:31.792 --> 01:27:33.124
Anyone die inside?

01:27:33.125 --> 01:27:35.207
- Is that a real vampire?
- Okay. Take it easy.

01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:36.875
I will answer all your
questions one by one.

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.250
There are many types of vampire.

01:27:49.417 --> 01:27:51.791
White vampire, cunning
vampire, iron vampire...

01:27:51.792 --> 01:27:53.375
And the dry vampire.

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.792
Different vampires have different power.

01:27:56.333 --> 01:27:58.417
Their characteristics are also different.

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.499
- When you meet them...
- Excuse me...

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.250
Is there any good or bad
differentiation for vampires?

01:28:08.958 --> 01:28:10.083
Good question.

01:28:10.167 --> 01:28:13.333
Vampires are the same as human being.
Might be good or bad.

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:17.625
You're already differentiated from
the others by asking this question.

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:20.125
Your fate is on your own hand.

01:28:20.667 --> 01:28:22.583
Good or bad.

01:28:22.917 --> 01:28:24.875
It all depends on you.

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:27.375
Tim, no more theory...

01:28:27.417 --> 01:28:30.417
- Start the training practice.
- Yes sir.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.999
- Master Chau.
- Let's practice sweep, shovel and discard.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.791
If I haven't asked Tim
to join our department,

01:28:35.792 --> 01:28:37.499
you're now just a dead body.

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.125
It's Tim saved my life, not you!

01:28:40.292 --> 01:28:42.082
Of course, with his anti-vampire
immune blood type,

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:44.167
that we can produce this vaccine.

01:28:44.458 --> 01:28:45.417
Agree?

01:28:45.418 --> 01:28:46.583
Sweep!

01:28:49.208 --> 01:28:50.667
Straight hands.

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.292
Shovel!

01:28:52.542 --> 01:28:54.125
Discard!

01:29:00.292 --> 01:29:01.958
Sorry... Sorry sir.

01:29:09.917 --> 01:29:11.375
What's your name?

01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:13.875
Winter Chan, W-i-n-t-e-r Chan.

01:29:17.958 --> 01:29:19.082
1st level alert.

01:29:19.083 --> 01:29:20.582
Vampire appears in Tsuen wan.

01:29:20.583 --> 01:29:23.417
Team A and B depart with rubbish trucks
and street washing vehicles

01:29:23.542 --> 01:29:24.750
Tim

01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:26.292
let's go.

01:29:27.083 --> 01:29:28.375
Got it.

01:29:33.042 --> 01:29:34.417
Keep it up-

01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:36.625
you can do it.

01:29:50.208 --> 01:29:51.375
Okay...

01:29:53.083 --> 01:29:54.500
Action.
