if there ever was one. Wow.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.257
So, tell me, where were you
taking the little woman?

11:55.674 --> 11:57.426
Come on, Casanova,
you can tell me?

11:57.718 --> 11:59.553
It'll be our own little secret.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.639
You can go now.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.640
Please, come on, Tom.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.684
Denial, repression,
compartmentalization

12:05.726 --> 12:07.728

going to tell me the truth.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.564
Come on, Professor.
(LAUGHS)

12:13.233 --> 12:14.609
I don't know if I told you,

12:14.693 --> 12:16.611
but a new dishwasher is
at the top of my Christmas list.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.572
Yeah, I saw it there.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.615
Actually, this remind me
of when we used to do dishes

12:20.657 --> 12:22.617
at our old apartment
in Boylston, remember?

12:23.535 --> 12:24.494
You were in grad school.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.704
We had that ancient dishwasher.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.582
I remember the landlord always
being there trying to fix it.

12:28.707 --> 12:29.624
He had a thing for you.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.501
What? Oh, come on.

12:31.585 --> 12:32.669
Are you 90

12:32.711 --> 12:33.670
He didn't.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.630
I mean,
okay, yeah, maybe he did,

12:35.714 --> 12:37.507
but I never encouraged it.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.469
Well, he was 140 years old,
you were 23.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.553
That would have been weird.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.720

the garbage disposal?

to Hal's game.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.602
He was great.
He scored two goals.

12:50.604 --> 12:51.730
I'll come to the next one.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.690
That's what you said last time.

13:07.579 --> 13:08.705
Who's Anne Glass?

13:09.706 --> 13:11.541
Anne Glass?

13:12.626 --> 13:13.710
Isn't that the woman
you were talking about

13:13.752 --> 13:16.588
- in your sleep last night?
- Yeah.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.467
Well, then shouldn't you
be telling me who she is?

Okay, you feel hot.

Dr. Raskin.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.656
You're really starting
to freak me out.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.637
Yeah, the husband
of the woman you're banging

14:47.679 --> 14:49.472
wants to kill you.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.610
I think somebody's
trying to gaslight me.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.653
Does that sound insane?

15:04.613 --> 15:06.656
Of course not.
Like, you historians,

15:06.698 --> 15:09.618
you're always obsessed
with organizing chaotic tangles

15:09.659 --> 15:12.537
of random, absurd events
and then trying to organize them

15:12.579 --> 15:14.706
into tidy, little orderly
narratives and explaining them.

15:15.457 --> 15:16.625
No, no.
Spare me the metaphysical rant.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.543
This isn't me
trying to explain anything.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.586
This isn't a joke.

15:20.503 --> 15:23.465
Something's going on.
This isn't my life.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.549
Mason, it's no joke.

Honestly, it's what Baudrillard
called the simulacrum.

That's where you can't tell
your life from your dreams

15:29.679 --> 15:31.598

Trust me. Just stop trying
to find meaning in it all.

She's right. I am.

15:57.707 --> 16:01.628
Does it have
anything to do with this?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.718
I'm not having an affair, Ben.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.595
I wouldn't do that
to your mother,

16:10.679 --> 16:11.638
I wouldn't do it
to your brothers,

16:11.680 --> 16:12.681
I wouldn't do it to you.

I'm trying to figure it out.

this weekend?

16:30.490 --> 16:31.616

- Are you?

16:41.543 --> 16:42.669
I got to go.

16:43.586 --> 16:44.587
Where are you going?

16:45.714 --> 16:46.673
What am I supposed to tell mom?

16:46.715 --> 16:47.632

No.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.580
You want to tell me
what's going on?

17:19.456 --> 17:21.541
I looked into hotels
and flights,

17:21.624 --> 17:22.584
and everything's available.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.461
I just need to know
where we're going.

17:24.502 --> 17:28.548

Jacksonville, Chicago?

17:28.590 --> 17:30.508
It's your Christmas present.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.386
Oh. Okay.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.681
Tell me.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.682
Boston...

17:39.601 --> 17:40.727
New York...

Jacksonville.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.613
Aren't we already in Boston?

17:51.696 --> 17:54.616
Exactly why I would eliminate it,
but that's just me.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.493
It is a nice hotel.

17:56.659 --> 17:57.577
Don't get me wrong.

17:57.619 --> 18:00.497
There's something great
about each one of these cities.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.624
The question is,
do you want to travel,

18:02.707 --> 18:04.459
how far far do you
want to travel,

18:04.501 --> 18:05.543
and is the sun important?

18:05.668 --> 18:07.712
I know that's technically
three questions.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.632
And if we never plan on
leaving the hotel,

18:11.508 --> 18:13.676

where we go, does it?

was to blow up your world.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.531
Fine. Go home, then.

Tell your wife
you're not in love with me.

away for the weekend.

you're taking her away instead.

19:22.620 --> 19:23.663

19:23.705 --> 19:25.540
so at least I don't make
the mistake of showing up.

This is so simple, Tom.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.576
You will tell me
where you plan to attack,

of yours, Maggie?

25:23.731 --> 25:27.527
Hal Mason is never coming back.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.695
He is gone, probably dead.

25:30.071 --> 25:31.697
And you'd be dead, too,
if he had taken you with him.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.783

for the Masons, will you?

was murdered.

whereabouts at the

26:18.744 --> 26:20.621
He was outside your door,
not in your room.

26:20.746 --> 26:21.706
That's correct, Colonel.

26:21.998 --> 26:24.625
I'm not in the habit
of sleeping with my bodyguards.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.546

you don't have one solid lead.

26:28.629 --> 26:29.630
What I'm telling you, ma'am,

26:29.672 --> 26:32.466
is that I can account
for everyone except you.

starting to see things my way.

26:48.566 --> 26:49.567
I could be wrong.

26:49.692 --> 26:54.113
But if I'm not, we need to be
clear-eyed about this.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.658
She hasn't allowed you
to radio Hathaway's people.

26:58.618 --> 26:59.702
Why?

27:00.494 --> 27:02.371
Now, I say
it's because she doesn't want

27:02.538 --> 27:04.582
any soldiers here poking around.

27:04.707 --> 27:05.708
And why is that?

27:06.500 --> 27:07.460
She wants to keep us
in the dark.

27:07.543 --> 27:08.628

looking for them right now.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.523

No.

ourselves, Colonel.

confirm that, but...

I'm betting whatever the target
is, Karen will be there,

28:04.558 --> 28:06.519
and I want you to put me
on the first team in.

the most casualties.

down once and for all.
