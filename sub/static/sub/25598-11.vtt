It was a smart move,

15:30.764 --> 15:32.390

break the law,

off the hook

to admit fault.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.870
that was 15 years ago,

16:35.870 --> 16:38.706

Or Jim Allen's a promoter
who let an overweight fighter

How about the fact a huge bet

A lot of bets were placed

at the last second.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.698

Now the only thing
they're counting to is to 10

24:35.849 --> 24:37.643
This was a mistake.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.145
I take full responsibility.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.479
Things were fine.
I do not want them to change.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.816
It doesn't matter
whether you handle this or--

24:43.816 --> 24:45.776
Goddamn it, Alex,

24:45.776 --> 24:47.569
it may be
the only play for you,

24:47.569 --> 24:49.196
but it is not for me.

24:49.196 --> 24:53.033
Now, I told you I would do
anything to keep him alive,

24:53.033 --> 24:55.619

taking back this case.

'cause Alex shit the bed

25:06.005 --> 25:07.714
with Thomas
and I need to fix it.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.009
Well, you better make time,
because Andrew Malik

25:10.009 --> 25:12.261
just trashed this firm
in the<i> Journal.</i>

25:13.387 --> 25:15.097
Shit,
so that's what he's up to.

25:15.097 --> 25:17.016
You want me to get
Harvey in here?

25:17.016 --> 25:18.600
No, it's his case.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.727
I don't wanna get involved.
If you ask me,

25:20.727 --> 25:22.771
you need to let Alex
handle his business

25:22.771 --> 25:25.274
and start making sure
Harvey isn't ruining yours.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.443
Gretchen, I appreciate you
bringing me this,

25:27.443 --> 25:29.278
but what I need is
to run my firm

25:29.278 --> 25:30.779
how I feel it should be run,

25:30.779 --> 25:32.739
and now, that means
taking care of Thomas

25:32.739 --> 25:35.868
and trusting that Harvey
will take care of himself.

25:48.339 --> 25:50.674
These are the top three
candidates in the city.

25:50.674 --> 25:54.094
You are not gonna find a more
qualified lawyer anywhere.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.222
Wow. Okay.
But you should hire this one.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.601
I'm sorry, you want me
to pass on these superheroes

26:01.601 --> 26:05.314
for a guy who graduated middle
of his class from SUNY Buffalo?

26:05.314 --> 26:07.733
Did you check to see whether
my nana's available?

26:07.733 --> 26:10.027
Thomas,
he didn't go to Harvard

26:10.027 --> 26:12.988
and he graduated the middle of
his class for the same reason.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.782
He was working full-time
to put himself through school.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.117
And if you give him a shot,

26:17.117 --> 26:19.619
he will go to the ends
of the Earth for you.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.788
And on top of that,
you're gonna love him.

26:21.788 --> 26:22.831
He's just like you.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.542
Handsome.
Stupid.

26:24.542 --> 26:25.751
But is he funny?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.545
Because he can't
be funnier than me.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.213
We can't have that.
Bad for morale.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.215
Not so much other people,
just mine,

26:31.215 --> 26:32.508

Can I go now?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.677
Yes, you can.

Um, I'm gonna meet with Brendon

26:39.681 --> 26:41.225
Great.
Would you tell Louis

26:41.225 --> 26:43.643
I'll send those contracts
at the end of the day?

26:43.643 --> 26:45.312
Louis?
Yeah.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.980
I gotta say,
I appreciate the fact

26:46.980 --> 26:49.191
that he hasn't handed me off
to somebody else.

26:49.191 --> 26:51.026
I didn't think
that he would keep me,

26:51.026 --> 26:53.571
considering he's got an entire
firm to run, but...

26:53.571 --> 26:55.697
pretty amazing guy.
Yes, he is.

You're Jim's lawyer, right?
I am.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.049
I'll need your help
with his defense.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.427
I've been boxing for 30 years,
but it's not often

27:16.427 --> 27:18.636
you come face-to-face
with the likes of you.

27:18.636 --> 27:21.098
You looking to test yourself,
that's a bad idea.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.475
I'm here to pick your brain.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.851
The guy I spar with,
whenever he throws a hook,

27:24.851 --> 27:26.770
I never see it coming.
Here's the thing:

27:26.770 --> 27:29.315
You don't have to see it
as long as you move inside.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.191

--that right kidney enough,

27:33.026 --> 27:34.528
he ain't throwing that hook.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.029
You go to the body
too often--

27:36.029 --> 27:38.198
What about the uppercut?
That's why you gotta

27:38.198 --> 27:40.033
stick and move.
You stick and move,

27:40.033 --> 27:41.785
you could walk
into that left cross.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.954
Can't hurt as long
as you keep your hands up.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.539
Then let me
ask you something.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.958
Why didn't you keep
your hands up against Alonzo?

27:47.958 --> 27:49.709
What?
You dropped your hands

27:49.709 --> 27:51.462
against Alonzo,
and I know why.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.088
You took a dive.

Yo, what the fuck
you just say to me, man?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.884
'Cause anyone that knows me
knows I would never do that.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.471
Really? I have a whole list
of people that know you.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.264
If I have to put them
on the stand,

28:02.264 --> 28:05.017
they'll testify that you
told them to bet against you.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.353
Unless you're telling me
that Jim was in on it--

28:07.353 --> 28:09.021
Jim had nothing
to do with it.

ahead of you.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.337
why I was in my car

Drove around an hour,
trying to remember,

28:37.341 --> 28:39.843
till the school
finally called me.

28:39.843 --> 28:42.929
Yo, I'm 35 years old, man.
You know how messed up that is?

messed up it is

28:44.431 --> 28:47.267

for a crime you committed.

getting his head bashed in

you took the case
back from Alex.

29:16.963 --> 29:18.965
He wanted to mutilate
the man's company.

29:18.965 --> 29:21.260
I'm not gonna let him.
What about your company?

I'm willing to bet
my entire salary you haven't

I don't believe this.
What are you gonna do?

29:38.151 --> 29:41.071
I'm not gonna do anything.
Malik's making us look like shit

29:41.071 --> 29:43.323
and you're not gonna
at least talk to Harvey?

29:43.323 --> 29:46.326
No, I'm not. I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I told Gretchen.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.870
I am managing this firm
as I see fit.

29:48.870 --> 29:51.081
Then I'll tell you
what Gretchen should have.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.999
You're doing a shitty job.
Excuse me?

29:52.999 --> 29:55.335

No, you didn't put me shit.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.803
You begged me to save
this firm, and I did.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.139
While we're talking
about this firm and bosses,

30:07.139 --> 30:09.349
you're also Harvey's boss
and Robert's boss,

30:09.349 --> 30:11.184
and you haven't been
overseeing them.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.604
You said to delegate.
That is exactly what I did.

30:13.604 --> 30:16.064
You weren't delegating, Louis.
You're abdicating.

And you're using Thomas' case

30:18.525 --> 30:20.611

It's not about your clients

30:48.806 --> 30:50.307
Well, that won't
be necessary.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.476
I assume that means
you've done what I asked.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.645
No. I did what
Donna asked.

30:54.645 --> 30:57.439
She figured out what was
going on and wanted to step in.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.526
And let me guess, you said
you'd rather handle me yourself.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.277
I did.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.196
And like I said,

31:04.196 --> 31:06.031
this isn't what
you asked me to do.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.449
Then what is it?

31:07.449 --> 31:08.908
I went through
Dexhart's files

31:08.908 --> 31:10.577
and found $10 million
in savings

31:10.577 --> 31:13.079
by closing loopholes
in their policy exclusions.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.665
They lost 80 million.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.667
And if you
can't explain to them

31:16.667 --> 31:18.627
that this is just the tip
of the iceberg

31:18.627 --> 31:21.296
in making them whole,
that's on you.

that you will not determine

31:25.509 --> 31:27.344
the type of lawyer
I want to be.

31:27.344 --> 31:29.346
What is that
supposed to mean?

31:29.346 --> 31:32.766
It means I looked into those
details like Louis would.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.810
I found another way
like Harvey would.

31:34.810 --> 31:40.399
And you want me to accept it
like who would?

31:40.399 --> 31:42.484
Because you left out Robert.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.194
And I don't think
if you did to him

31:44.194 --> 31:45.945
what you did to me,
he'd accept it.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.906

Robert would've done

31:47.906 --> 31:50.534
what you did to me
in the first place.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.202
But in addition to this,

31:52.202 --> 31:53.995
I'm willing to say
I owe you one.

So make an enemy
of me or not.

what we're gonna do.

We'll wait for Malik

32:10.470 --> 32:12.431
to make a fool of himself,

he got the wrong guy.

I don't give a shit
what he has.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.359
He was gonna let his mentor
go to prison.

You don't know
what he would've done

32:26.194 --> 32:28.196
if it had come to that.
He threw a fight

32:28.196 --> 32:31.450
in the sport I love, and what
happens to him isn't my problem.

Ricky threw a fight
to take care of his family.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.509
If you're so sure,
what do you think we should do?

32:49.509 --> 32:51.637
Go to Malik,
tell him he has the wrong guy,

32:51.637 --> 32:53.639
and cut the best deal
we can for Ricky.

Are you out of your mind?
We took this thing

32:55.766 --> 32:58.977

I'm not going anywhere,
and this case

33:04.065 --> 33:05.776
is as much mine
as it is yours.

33:05.776 --> 33:07.778
It's not either one of yours.
It's mine.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.613
Excuse me?
I said, it is mine.

33:09.613 --> 33:12.699
I'm not gonna let you jeopardize
this firm with some vendetta.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.118
What happened to me
being a wild stallion?

33:15.118 --> 33:18.413
What happened is I was afraid
to tell you the truth.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.749
And the truth is,
I am running this place,

33:20.749 --> 33:22.835
and we all need to get
on board with that,

33:22.835 --> 33:25.462
and it starts
with you reading me in.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.714
Okay, Louis.
We'll read you in.

33:27.714 --> 33:31.551
But there is no way I am
letting Malik off the hook.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.097
Look, we've been over this
all night.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.309
It comes down to a choice
between cutting Ricky a deal

33:39.309 --> 33:41.728
and payback with Malik,
and I am not going--

33:41.728 --> 33:44.189
Wait a second.
Payback. That's it.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.066
What's "it," Louis?
Where are you going with this?

33:47.066 --> 33:48.485
How much revenue
has Jim lost

33:48.485 --> 33:50.069
since these charges
were brought?

33:50.069 --> 33:52.280
His license is suspended.
He hasn't been able

33:52.280 --> 33:54.032
to book a fight.
What's your point?

33:54.032 --> 33:56.660
Once we show he's innocent,
someone needs to pay back

33:56.660 --> 33:59.371
all the revenue he's lost.
That someone is Andrew Malik.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.499
I don't wanna take his money.
I want to ruin his reputation.

34:02.499 --> 34:05.126
What Louis is saying
is that Malik won't pay it.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.129
The state will.
Which means the voters will.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.298
You talking about
suing him for compensation

34:10.298 --> 34:12.091
under the Wrongful
Prosecution Act?

34:12.091 --> 34:13.886
You bet your
sweet hindquarters I am.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.888
Which means he either
cuts Ricky a deal,

34:15.888 --> 34:18.807
or any higher-office aspirations
he has, they're done.

34:18.807 --> 34:20.767
You think Jim Allen
will forgo a lawsuit

34:20.767 --> 34:22.352
just to get Ricky
a better deal?

34:22.352 --> 34:24.646
Once he finds out
why Ricky did it, he will.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.189
There's only one problem.

34:26.189 --> 34:28.191
You wanted to ruin
Malik's reputation.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.359
This deal won't do that.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.319
You leave that to me.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.942
He made two.

the final contract by you.

No, Louis,

Isn't it a coincidence
that Larry signed

41:37.370 --> 41:39.080
You really came through.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.623
Right back at you,
Harvey.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.834
I'd say
we did our girl proud.

41:42.834 --> 41:46.254
To Jessica.
To Jessica.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.006
What?
You know, I was just thinking.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.133
I sold Jim that this case
was<i> Rocky IV,</i>

41:50.133 --> 41:51.843
but it turned out
to be<i> Rocky III.</i>

41:51.843 --> 41:53.303
The one where
Apollo and Rocky

41:53.303 --> 41:54.804
come together
to beat Mr. T?

41:54.804 --> 41:56.931
Sure as hell wasn't
talking about<i> Rocky V.</i>

41:56.931 --> 41:59.184
You know what happens
at the end of<i> Rocky III.</i>

41:59.184 --> 42:01.060
Yeah, Rocky and Apollo
go toe-to-toe.

42:01.060 --> 42:04.147
You're wondering what would
happen if we went toe-to-toe.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.231
I don't need to wonder.

42:05.231 --> 42:07.066
I know what'd happen.
I'd win.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.734
Whatever gets you
through the day.

42:08.734 --> 42:10.778
Holy shit.
What?

42:10.778 --> 42:12.489
We're in here
arguing about

42:12.489 --> 42:14.449
who's better
between you and me.

42:14.449 --> 42:15.867
What if Louis turns out

42:15.867 --> 42:18.119
to be a better managing partner
than both of us?

42:18.119 --> 42:20.246
Jesus Christ, that'd be
the worst<i> Rocky</i> ever.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.540
No,<i> Rocky V</i> is still
the worst<i> Rocky</i> ever.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.334
Finally, something
we can agree on.

42:24.334 --> 42:26.669
Truth be told,
I never even saw<i> Rocky VI.</i>

42:26.669 --> 42:28.421
Neither did anybody else,
Robert.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.173
You know,
that new<i> Creed</i> franchise,

42:30.173 --> 42:31.966
oh, that's quite
a little something.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.259
Really?
Mm-hmm.

42:33.259 --> 42:34.427
Maybe I should watch it.

42:34.427 --> 42:35.970
Wanna come over?
Do I look like

42:35.970 --> 42:37.472
I don't have nothing
to do but to

42:37.472 --> 42:39.432
watch<i> Rocky VII</i>
with your lonely ass?

42:39.432 --> 42:41.600
But I got popcorn.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.019
I'll call Laura.

42:43.019 --> 42:44.979
<i>♪ Ah ♪</i>

42:44.979 --> 42:50.402
<i>♪ There ain't</i>
<i>No running from me ♪</i>

42:50.402 --> 42:53.863
<i>♪ No, no, no ♪</i>

42:53.863 --> 42:56.824
<i>♪ There ain't</i>
<i>No running from me ♪</i>

42:56.824 --> 42:59.869
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>
