00:47.474 --> 00:49.772
<i>My dad always told me stories about her-</i>

00:50.878 --> 00:54.439
<i>How she was this great
oceanographer.</i>

00:55.449 --> 00:57.917
<i>Stories about
the baby they had...</i>

00:57.985 --> 01:01.079
<i>and how my mom
just had to name her... Nim.</i>

01:01.155 --> 01:03.350
<i>She invented that name.</i>

01:03.424 --> 01:05.949
<i>At least, that's how my dad
tells the story.</i>

01:08.028 --> 01:12.397
<i>That's all my mother is to me now-
just these stories.</i>

01:13.701 --> 01:17.569
<i>But they're really
some amazing stories.</i>

01:19.373 --> 01:24.834
<i>Like the one he calls
"The Oceanographer and the Great Blue Whale."</i>

01:27.314 --> 01:32.047
<i>Once upon a time, the oceanographer
went out on the wide-open sea...</i>

01:32.119 --> 01:36.647
<i>to find out what was in the stomach
of the great blue whale.</i>

01:39.193 --> 01:41.957
<i>As my mother was staring into
the mouth of the whale...</i>

01:42.029 --> 01:44.998
<i>a mysterious ship
came out of nowhere.</i>

01:46.734 --> 01:49.635
<i>It was called
The Buccaneer Ship.</i>

01:50.838 --> 01:53.932
<i>It got much too close,
and it frightened the whale.</i>

01:54.008 --> 01:58.707
<i>And the oceanographer
was swallowed and taken by the sea.</i>

02:01.782 --> 02:05.980
<i>Dad felt that we should sail the ocean
and look for that blue whale-</i>

02:06.053 --> 02:09.113
<i>that, someday, that whale
would bring her back to us.</i>

02:10.457 --> 02:13.392
<i>I think he just missed her.</i>

02:13.460 --> 02:15.394
<i>We both did.</i>

02:17.398 --> 02:21.732
<i>By my fourth birthday,
we had sailed around the globe... twice-</i>

02:21.802 --> 02:24.930
<i>From the Cape of Good Hope
to the tip of Ratagonia...</i>

02:25.005 --> 02:27.439
<i>from Singapore
to the Cook Islands.</i>

02:28.942 --> 02:32.275
<i>Then one day, we found it-</i>

02:33.480 --> 02:35.539
<i>our home.</i>

02:41.121 --> 02:43.055
<i>This is my island.</i>

02:45.059 --> 02:47.721
<i>Not a bad place to grow up, huh?</i>

02:47.795 --> 02:50.491
<i>See, I don't have to
go to school.</i>

02:50.564 --> 02:52.691
<i>- I'm home-schooled.
- Hey, Selkie!</i>

02:52.766 --> 02:54.324
Watch out! Move it!

02:54.401 --> 02:57.029
<i>Or, technically, island-schooled.</i>

02:57.104 --> 03:00.335
Sorry!

03:00.407 --> 03:04.400
<i>- Everything I know about the world
I learned from my friends.</i>

03:04.478 --> 03:06.537
Galileo!

03:06.613 --> 03:08.547
<i>Like, do you know
that two objects...</i>

03:08.615 --> 03:12.244
<i>no matter how big they are,
will fall at exactly the same speed?</i>

03:12.319 --> 03:16.085
<i>Galileo proved it.
He's my pelican.</i>

03:17.925 --> 03:20.917
<i>Selkie, my sea lion,
taught me how to swim.</i>

03:20.994 --> 03:24.555
<i>So I returned the favor by teaching her soccer.</i>

03:24.631 --> 03:26.963
<i>She's an excellent midfielder.</i>

03:28.802 --> 03:32.932
<i>Oh, and I'll bet you didn't know that
sea turtles and certain species oflizards...</i>

03:33.006 --> 03:35.201
<i>really get on each other's nerves.</i>

03:39.680 --> 03:41.807
<i>Anything else
I need to know about the world...</i>

03:41.882 --> 03:45.045
<i>I just open one of the books
my dad brought for me.</i>

03:45.119 --> 03:49.453
<i>With a little imagination, I can go anywhere.</i>

03:54.862 --> 03:57.763
<i>All in all, not a bad life.</i>

03:57.831 --> 04:01.267
<i>For dinner, I throw together
some vegetables from our garden.</i>

04:01.335 --> 04:05.829
<i>And for a little extra flavor,
I toss in some freshly dug-up mealworms.</i>

04:05.906 --> 04:08.397
<i>Mmm. My dad's favorite.</i>

04:08.475 --> 04:11.410
Incredible day, Nim.
A new species, I think.

04:11.478 --> 04:13.844
Well, if it's new, remember
what you're naming it.

04:13.914 --> 04:16.178
"Protozoa Nim."
I haven't forgotten.

04:16.250 --> 04:19.651
<i>See, my dad's a marine biologist.</i>

04:19.720 --> 04:22.814
<i>He's obsessed with nanoplankton,
the tiniest little particles in the ocean.</i>

04:22.890 --> 04:26.792
<i>They're not really my thing,
but to each his own, right?</i>

04:26.860 --> 04:30.921
Did you know there are millions
of picoplankton in a milliliter of water?

04:30.998 --> 04:33.694
Protozoa Nim could be here right now.

04:34.768 --> 04:37.293
What? Wha-

04:37.371 --> 04:40.431
- Hey, Lizard!
- He's not "Lizard." His name is Fred.

04:43.377 --> 04:47.313
<i>For a guy who loves nature,
you'd think he'd be more into animals.</i>

04:47.381 --> 04:51.681
<i>When they have more than one cell,
Jack sort of loses interest.</i>

04:51.752 --> 04:57.213
<i>Scientists write to him from all over the world
with questions about all sorts of things.</i>

04:57.291 --> 04:59.816
<i>He even writes articles sometimes...</i>

04:59.893 --> 05:02.953
<i>like this great one
for National Geographic.</i>

05:06.800 --> 05:09.894
- What's the reading?
- Thirty-seven knots!

05:11.872 --> 05:14.898
<i>Hey, I'm not saying a scientist's
life is for everyone...</i>

05:14.975 --> 05:17.375
<i>but it is the life for us.</i>

05:20.447 --> 05:24.213
<i>Every few months, the supply ship comes,
bringing us things that we need.</i>

05:24.284 --> 05:27.583
<i>New books and paper,
nails and cloth-</i>

05:27.654 --> 05:30.350
<i>All the things we can't
make for ourselves.</i>

05:32.926 --> 05:35.986
<i>We sail out
into the open water to meet it.</i>

05:37.731 --> 05:40.825
<i>No one, not even
the supply ship's captain...</i>

05:40.901 --> 05:45.235
<i>has ever seen how amazing
our little island really is.</i>

05:45.305 --> 05:49.537
We take care of our island, Nim,
our island's gonna take care of us.

05:50.811 --> 05:53.405
<i>And that's the way
we wanna keep it-</i>

05:53.480 --> 05:57.314
<i>our own perfect, secret world.</i>

06:00.053 --> 06:01.953
<i>- Are ya ready?
- I'm ready.</i>

06:05.158 --> 06:08.093
Ah, bounty.

06:08.161 --> 06:11.392
Look at this-
Heirloom tomato seeds.

06:11.465 --> 06:14.314
<i>Do you remember those freckled
ones we were reading about?</i>

06:14.315 --> 06:14.866
Check it out!

06:14.935 --> 06:18.371
<i>The new Alex Rover!
My Arabian Adventure.</i>

06:18.438 --> 06:20.599
What do you think happens
in Arabia?

06:20.674 --> 06:22.608
Wait until after dinner, Nim.

06:22.676 --> 06:25.144
No, I'm just gonna start it.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.914
<i>"It's been my curse my entire life.</i>

06:31.985 --> 06:36.479
<i>"I do not go looking for trouble,
but somehow it finds me.</i>

06:36.557 --> 06:38.889
<i>The question wasn't, am I going to die?</i>

06:38.959 --> 06:42.258
<i>The question was, how am I going to die?</i>

06:42.329 --> 06:47.232
<i>Will it be by my captors' guns,
or will it be death by thirst?</i>

06:48.569 --> 06:52.437
Must be the hero
of my own life story.

06:52.506 --> 06:55.703
Must be the hero
of my own life story.

06:55.776 --> 06:58.870
<i>Must be the hero
of my own life story.</i>

06:58.946 --> 07:01.779
Where are you taking me?

07:04.151 --> 07:08.815
A special hole, just for you,
Alex Rover.

07:09.957 --> 07:13.620
<i>Ever heard of the Pit of Spiders?</i>

07:16.196 --> 07:18.426
"Pit of Spiders," huh?

07:18.498 --> 07:21.023
Well, I guess that answers
the "how will I die" question.

07:46.426 --> 07:48.189
Aah!

07:52.466 --> 07:54.866
No, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, stop!

07:54.935 --> 07:57.335
Where're you going?

07:57.404 --> 08:01.864
Oh, death by thirst makes a late comeback.

08:09.416 --> 08:12.977
How did Alex Rover
get to be Alex Rover?

08:13.053 --> 08:16.511
- Well, let's see.
- Was he born with all that courage?

08:16.590 --> 08:18.581
"Was he born with all that courage?"

08:18.659 --> 08:20.627
Hmm.

08:20.694 --> 08:24.425
The thing about courage is...

08:24.498 --> 08:28.832
it's somethin' that we have to learn
and relearn our whole lives.

08:28.902 --> 08:31.370
You know, it's not just in you.

08:31.438 --> 08:34.839
It's in every choice we make,
each and every day.

08:38.645 --> 08:41.628
Where do you think Alex
Rover is at this very minute?

08:41.629 --> 08:42.842
Oh, well, I don't know.

08:42.916 --> 08:48.877
Maybe he's chained up in a sarcophagus
20,000 fathoms under the sea.

08:50.190 --> 08:52.385
Or in some pit of spiders...

08:52.459 --> 08:55.724
trapped without the antidote
for their poison.

08:55.796 --> 08:58.458
Yeah, pit of spiders.
I like that.

08:58.532 --> 09:01.558
Okay. Time to get some rest.

09:04.204 --> 09:06.195
Sleep tight, now, okay?

09:07.808 --> 09:10.368
And no dreaming about spiders.

09:43.009 --> 09:45.068
Spider! Spider!

09:47.247 --> 09:50.011
Get away from me.

09:51.918 --> 09:56.855
All right.
These all go back here.

09:56.923 --> 09:59.858
Straight. Right angles.

10:09.202 --> 10:11.966
Is-ls this the, uh,
Telegraph Hill Pharmacy?

10:12.038 --> 10:14.097
Yes, I need a delivery, please.

10:14.174 --> 10:16.108
Uh, Purell.

10:16.176 --> 10:18.701
Well, h-how many bottles do you have?

10:18.779 --> 10:20.838
Oh. Uh, very good.
All of them.

10:20.914 --> 10:22.848
Yeah. Send 'em all.

10:28.255 --> 10:30.189
<i>Uh, who is it?</i>

10:30.257 --> 10:33.192
<i>- Telegraph Hill Pharmacy.
- Uh, just leave it there, please.</i>

10:33.260 --> 10:35.228
Just leave it here?
In the rain?

10:35.295 --> 10:38.822
<i>Yeah, go ahead. I-I put it
on my MasterCard. I left you a very nice tip.</i>

10:38.899 --> 10:41.333
<i>- Uh, make sure you get it.
- Okay.</i>

10:56.249 --> 11:00.743
<i>Alexandra, it's Buffy, your favorite editor.</i>

11:00.821 --> 11:04.086
<i>I know you're there,
and I know you're not going to pick up.</i>

11:04.157 --> 11:06.091
<i>I just worry about you, darling...</i>

11:06.159 --> 11:08.889
<i>sitting at your computer,
living on a diet of only Progresso soup.</i>

11:10.030 --> 11:12.396
<i>- How can you eat that every day?
- Buffy.</i>

11:12.465 --> 11:14.558
<i>So, how is
the new Alex Rover coming?</i>

11:14.634 --> 11:17.467
<i>Wasn't I supposed to read
something two weeks ago?</i>

11:17.537 --> 11:20.131
<i>No pressure, no pressure,
no pressure.</i>

11:29.316 --> 11:33.116
<i>See, what you don't know about me
is that where there's an Alex Rover-</i>

11:33.186 --> 11:35.086
there's a way!

11:35.155 --> 11:39.091
I have a certain knack for getting out of
predicaments far worse than this one, you know.

11:39.159 --> 11:42.890
Eh. Excuse me?

11:42.963 --> 11:45.864
No, hold on. No. I'm supposed
to get outta this, you know.

11:45.932 --> 11:50.960
Alexandra!

11:52.439 --> 11:55.897
Why can't I get this?

11:55.976 --> 11:59.571
No pressure, no pressure,
no pressure.

12:01.214 --> 12:03.910
Volcanic sacrifice.
What was I thinking?

12:03.984 --> 12:06.475
<i>Volcano, volcano.</i>

12:07.554 --> 12:11.490
<i>"Living in the Shadow
of a Volcano. "Hmm.</i>

12:11.558 --> 12:14.425
Well, that's just crazy.
I mean, why would anyone do that?

12:30.644 --> 12:33.636
Oh, wow.

12:33.713 --> 12:35.977
Perfect.

12:55.168 --> 12:57.932
<i>- What you doin', Jack?
- Ah, there you are!</i>

12:58.004 --> 13:02.338
Current's shifted, Nim. Zander's Atoll
is gonna be just five feet underwater.

13:02.409 --> 13:04.843
<i>Zander's Atoll?
But it's almost dinner!</i>

13:04.911 --> 13:07.846
<i>Hey, we might not see algae
growth like this for years.</i>

13:07.914 --> 13:09.779
More plankton?

13:09.849 --> 13:11.942
This is the trip
we find Protozoa Nim.

13:12.018 --> 13:14.213
I swear it.
I can feel it in my bones.

13:14.287 --> 13:17.120
But Chicca's eggs are about to hatch.
I need to be here.

13:17.190 --> 13:21.251
No negotiating. I mean,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

13:21.328 --> 13:21.800
Come on!

13:21.801 --> 13:25.162
Yeah, you said that last week
about the southern borealis.

13:25.231 --> 13:29.691
- Two nights, Nim.
- No! Chicca only saved one last year, Jack.

13:29.769 --> 13:32.636
One little turtle. I want to stay.

13:32.706 --> 13:34.970
We can talk
on the satellite phone.

13:35.041 --> 13:37.805
Nim, please.

13:37.877 --> 13:40.345
I'm not a little girl anymore.

13:44.484 --> 13:47.044
You got so much of your mom in you,
you know that?

13:47.120 --> 13:49.554
<i>- That's a good thing, right?
- Yeah, good.</i>

13:49.622 --> 13:51.556
Sure.

13:51.624 --> 13:54.559
Unfortunately, I could never win a fight
with her either.

13:56.429 --> 13:59.193
<i>Okay, it's only four hours
till low tide.</i>

13:59.265 --> 14:02.860
Oh! Hey, could you grab
my collection jars and my wet suit?

14:02.936 --> 14:04.870
<i>I already packed them for you!</i>

14:04.938 --> 14:08.430
Any e-mails show up, tell 'em I'm on expedition.
I'll get to their questions on Thursday.

14:08.508 --> 14:10.442
Hey, Lizard, get off of that.

14:10.510 --> 14:12.239
<i>He's not "Lizard."
His name is Fred.</i>

14:12.312 --> 14:15.281
<i>Unless it's, like,
a ridiculously obvious e-mail.</i>

14:15.348 --> 14:18.681
- Then I can help 'em, right?
- I'd rather you just said Thursday.

14:18.752 --> 14:20.845
Nim, are you sure
you're okay with this?

14:20.920 --> 14:22.717
Come on.
You've left me alone before.

14:22.789 --> 14:24.916
Well, yeah. One night.
But never for two.

14:24.991 --> 14:29.394
Well, look, I've got Selkie and Fred
and Galileo and the new Alex Rover book.

14:29.462 --> 14:32.522
- I'll be excellent.
- All right, all right.

14:34.567 --> 14:37.968
- You just come back with Protozoa Nim!
- I will!

14:38.038 --> 14:41.132
I'll see ya Thursday!
Love you!

14:41.207 --> 14:43.471
Love you too!

14:43.543 --> 14:46.137
I'll radio you tonight!

14:46.212 --> 14:49.613
No parties while I'm gone!

14:51.451 --> 14:55.478
<i>#Baby, baby
please let me hold him #</i>

14:55.555 --> 15:00.049
<i>#I wanna make him stay up all night #</i>

15:00.126 --> 15:04.153
<i>#Sister, Sister
He's just a plaything #</i>

15:04.230 --> 15:07.893
<i># We wanna make him
stay up all night #</i>

15:07.967 --> 15:10.265
<i>#Here we go #</i>

15:17.877 --> 15:22.211
<i>#See him drink from a bottle #</i>

15:22.282 --> 15:23.909
<i>#See him eat from a plate ##</i>

15:25.518 --> 15:28.612
<i>Ooh, two new e-mails.
Aren't we popular?</i>

15:28.688 --> 15:30.417
<i>Hey, Freddie.</i>

15:30.490 --> 15:32.515
How's it goin'?

15:32.592 --> 15:36.892
"Dear Jack Rusoe, I need a bit of help
on my newest adventure.

15:36.963 --> 15:40.956
Might you be able to answer
a few questions for me? Alex Rover."

15:41.034 --> 15:42.934
Alex Rover?

15:43.002 --> 15:45.493
Alex Rover is writing to my dad?

15:45.572 --> 15:48.598
<i>Do you think it's the Alex Rover?</i>

15:51.544 --> 15:56.311
It's him! It's him! It's really him!

15:56.382 --> 16:01.843
Dear Alex Rover, I'm sure Jack would love
to help you with your newest adventure.

16:01.921 --> 16:06.290
He's a great fan of yours.
We both are.

16:06.359 --> 16:10.090
From... Nim.

16:19.105 --> 16:21.039
<i>"Dear Alex Rover...</i>

16:21.107 --> 16:24.634
<i>"I'm sure Jack would love to help you
with your newest adventure.</i>

16:24.711 --> 16:29.444
<i>"He'll be back on Thursday.
He's a great fan of yours. We both are.</i>

16:29.516 --> 16:31.711
From Nim."

16:31.784 --> 16:36.050
Nim. Hmm, what an unusual name.

16:38.358 --> 16:42.795
<i>Dear Nim, are you Jack's
research associate?</i>

16:42.862 --> 16:45.524
<i>Jack wrote of a volcano
where you live.</i>

16:45.598 --> 16:49.591
Are you familiar with it?
Sincerely, Alex Rover.

16:49.669 --> 16:51.603
Send.

16:52.839 --> 16:56.866
- What are you doing, Alexandra?
- Um, research.

16:56.943 --> 16:59.104
Go. Go. Go away.
Leave me alone.

16:59.179 --> 17:02.615
You don't mean that.
You love me.

17:02.682 --> 17:05.515
And what makes you so sure of that, huh?

17:06.653 --> 17:11.056
Because the whole world
loves Alex Rover.

17:11.124 --> 17:14.582
Really? I know.
"Translated into 21 different languages."

17:14.661 --> 17:17.289
No pressure, no pressure,
no pressure.

17:22.101 --> 17:24.092
You've been writing chapter eight
for three months now.

17:24.170 --> 17:29.437
So either sacrifice me to the damn volcano
or let me find my escape already.

17:29.509 --> 17:33.468
- Hey! It's time to finish the book.
- Shh!

17:33.546 --> 17:36.845
- I'm thinking.
- Yeah. You're thinking. You're thinking.

17:36.916 --> 17:41.410
That's the problem. You've gotta
get outta your head and into your body.

17:41.487 --> 17:44.888
Hey, that's it. Kinka.

17:44.958 --> 17:46.892
"Kinka"?

17:46.960 --> 17:48.894
Kinka!

17:50.063 --> 17:51.997
Kinka!

17:53.066 --> 17:55.967
Kinka!

18:02.909 --> 18:04.809
Yeah!

18:13.820 --> 18:15.913
<i>It was incredible, Jack.</i>

18:15.989 --> 18:19.322
<i>Chicca's babies were born
tonight, just like I said.</i>

18:19.392 --> 18:22.520
<i>- That's excellent.
- And the mole crabs were crazy hungry.</i>

18:22.595 --> 18:27.464
<i>It was so important that I stayed.
I saved all six turtles.</i>

18:27.533 --> 18:29.933
<i>Well, they're lucky you were there.
I'm proud of you, honey.</i>

18:30.003 --> 18:33.700
- How's Zander's Atoll?
- Oh, I wish you could see this, Nim. It's-

18:33.773 --> 18:37.174
I mean, it's more incredible
than the Milky Way.

18:37.243 --> 18:39.302
Next time
there's no negotiating, okay?

18:39.379 --> 18:42.143
Have you found
my nanoplankton yet?

18:42.215 --> 18:45.742
Mmm. I have a pretty good
feeling about it.

18:48.221 --> 18:51.452
Now, go to sleep, Nim. No more reading.
We'll talk in the morning.

18:51.524 --> 18:53.719
How did you know I was reading?

18:53.793 --> 18:56.489
Oh, I know you pretty well.

18:58.264 --> 19:01.995
Good night, Nim.
Sleep tight.

19:04.737 --> 19:09.071
It's just magnificent.

20:01.894 --> 20:04.226
No!

20:49.542 --> 20:53.308
Jack?
Daddy?

21:11.264 --> 21:13.198
<i>Oh, no.</i>

21:30.483 --> 21:34.044
Freddie!

22:05.818 --> 22:07.786
It's a mess in here, eh, Selk?

22:19.465 --> 22:23.663
No power. This rots.

22:47.426 --> 22:50.190
Jack?

22:51.364 --> 22:56.529
<i>Can you hear me?
Jack... Michael... Rusoe?</i>

22:57.537 --> 23:01.098
<i>Daddy, can you hear me?</i>

23:01.173 --> 23:03.869
<i>Jack?</i>

23:03.943 --> 23:06.571
<i>Come in, Daddy!</i>

23:09.582 --> 23:13.211
<i>Jack? Daddy?</i>

24:02.401 --> 24:04.528
<i>Protozoa Nim.</i>

24:05.705 --> 24:08.902
Leak. Leak is not good.

24:08.975 --> 24:11.466
Nobody likes a leak.

24:20.219 --> 24:23.052
<i>Oh.</i>

24:24.056 --> 24:25.990
Middle of nowhere.

24:27.994 --> 24:31.794
No mast. No satellite.

24:31.864 --> 24:34.594
Sinking ship.

24:37.703 --> 24:41.833
How do I get back to Nim?

24:55.588 --> 24:58.318
He's not even due back till tomorrow, right, Fred?

24:58.391 --> 25:00.689
Nothin' to worry about.

25:30.056 --> 25:33.219
Gotta get food. I gotta get strength.

25:33.292 --> 25:35.522
I gotta get back to Nim.

25:43.135 --> 25:45.603
That's my fish! I saw it first!

25:50.176 --> 25:53.737
What? Huh?
Who are you?

25:55.548 --> 25:59.814
<i>Do I know you?
You're one of Nim's friends?</i>

26:02.021 --> 26:06.117
I must be gettin' sunstroke. Talkin' to a bird.

26:32.051 --> 26:34.849
<i>You just come back with Protozoa Nim!</i>

26:34.920 --> 26:37.616
I will! I'll see ya Thursday!

26:37.690 --> 26:41.091
<i>- I love you!
- Love you tool</i>

26:41.160 --> 26:43.958
<i>I'll radio you tonight!</i>

26:50.970 --> 26:54.633
It's a mess in here, eh, Selk?

27:12.558 --> 27:15.322
Alex Rover?
He's writing to us again?

27:16.829 --> 27:19.627
<i>"Dear Nim, are you Jack's research associate?</i>

27:19.698 --> 27:23.134
<i>"Perhaps you can help me.
I'm up against a very serious deadline.</i>

27:23.202 --> 27:27.366
<i>"Jack wrote of a volcano where you live.
Are you familiar with it?</i>

27:27.439 --> 27:29.999
<i>Sincerely,
Alex Rover. "</i>

27:31.744 --> 27:35.111
Dear Alex Rover,
we do have a volcano-

27:35.181 --> 27:37.115
"Only we call it
Fire Mountain.

27:37.183 --> 27:41.483
It hasn't exploded in years, but when it did,
the sky went completely white with ash."

27:41.554 --> 27:45.820
That's excellent.
"Sky white with ash." I like that image.

27:45.891 --> 27:51.796
All right. Dear Nim, can one really
see bubbling lava...

27:51.864 --> 27:55.163
inside the mouth of a volcano?

27:56.335 --> 27:59.327
Send.
All right.

27:59.405 --> 28:02.067
I can't wait for that.

28:03.075 --> 28:06.738
Oh, no. Mailman.
Oh, no. Hey!

28:06.812 --> 28:10.213
Uh- Uh- Excuse me!
Can you just leave it on the porch?

28:10.282 --> 28:12.876
Can you just leave it
under the door?

28:12.952 --> 28:14.886
<i>Ouch.</i>

28:16.789 --> 28:18.757
<i>Dear Alex Rover...</i>

28:18.824 --> 28:22.726
<i>I'm not sure what it looks like inside
a volcano, but I'll let you know soon.</i>

28:22.795 --> 28:26.060
<i>Sincerely, Nim,
Jack's research associate.</i>

28:29.268 --> 28:31.065
<i>Oh, so much mail.</i>

28:46.285 --> 28:48.913
I just open the door. Open the door, no big deal.

28:48.988 --> 28:50.922
Just get the mail,
get the mail.

28:54.727 --> 28:57.287
<i>Okay, Fred. No big deal.
Let's do this.</i>

28:58.998 --> 29:01.558
I can do it.
I can do it.

29:01.634 --> 29:04.797
Everyone turns knobs.
You can do it. Come on.

29:04.870 --> 29:10.604
Come on. Just a little farther.

29:20.185 --> 29:23.177
Okay, grab it.
One, two, three.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.925
<i>Oh.</i>

29:33.966 --> 29:36.867
Who needs mail?

29:36.936 --> 29:38.870
I can get it tomorrow.

29:46.512 --> 29:48.639
Hmm, interesting.

29:48.714 --> 29:52.275
Not really lava as much as
dry, craggy rock.

29:52.351 --> 29:56.378
<i>I can't wait to tell Alex Rover.</i>

29:56.455 --> 30:00.551
Galileo, we were worried about you!
Where'd you go?

30:03.929 --> 30:07.387
We're just doing some research for Alex Rove-

30:07.466 --> 30:11.368
What's that? Hold on, Fred!

30:36.495 --> 30:38.554
Oh, come on.
Come on, open up!

30:40.599 --> 30:43.227
Open! Unclip, unclip!

30:45.838 --> 30:48.466
Come on!

31:01.520 --> 31:03.784
Aah!

31:09.661 --> 31:12.129
Fred, are you okay?

31:12.197 --> 31:17.999
- Let's, um- Let's not tell Jack
we came here, okay?

31:18.070 --> 31:21.631
<i>"Dear Alex Rover, my volcano expedition
didn't go well at all.</i>

31:21.707 --> 31:26.337
I fell down the face of the mountain
and got a nasty five-inch cut on my leg."

31:26.412 --> 31:28.437
Oh, my. All because of me.

31:28.514 --> 31:31.483
<i>"It's very swollen
and now pus is coming out.</i>

31:31.550 --> 31:36.112
<i>P.S. How would you handle
a five-inch gash with pus coming out?"</i>

31:38.223 --> 31:40.350
What would I do?

31:44.863 --> 31:47.764
<i>Dear Nim,
the most important thing for a cut...</i>

31:47.833 --> 31:50.267
<i>is to make sure
that it's kept clean and dry.</i>

31:50.335 --> 31:54.635
<i>In the Cook Islands,
they use the stem of a Simarouba plant...</i>

31:54.706 --> 31:57.675
<i>- to keep out infection.
- Hmm. Simarouba.</i>

31:59.044 --> 32:01.808
P.S.
Are you all right, Nim?

32:03.549 --> 32:07.815
<i>"Dear Alex,
regarding your question 'Am I all right? '</i>

32:07.886 --> 32:11.049
"I will be
when my dad gets back.

32:11.123 --> 32:14.991
"But it's awfully good
talking to a real live hero.

32:16.662 --> 32:18.596
Nim."

32:18.664 --> 32:21.155
W-Wait a minute.
"When my dad gets back"?

32:23.635 --> 32:26.536
Oh, my God.

32:32.878 --> 32:37.042
Who are you, Nim?
How old are you?

32:38.951 --> 32:41.385
Are you all alone,
wherever you are?

32:58.137 --> 33:03.473
<i>What is it?
What does it want out there?</i>

33:07.713 --> 33:10.511
<i>It's coming so fast.</i>

33:16.889 --> 33:21.519
<i>"Buccaneer?" Buccaneer ship?</i>

33:22.995 --> 33:26.692
<i>"The Oceanographer
and the Great Blue Whale. "</i>

33:26.765 --> 33:28.926
<i>Oh, no.</i>

33:30.435 --> 33:33.097
I think we're being invaded.

33:52.925 --> 33:55.792
Simply heavenly.
Bloody paradise.

33:55.861 --> 33:58.591
<i>Not on any map, either.</i>

33:58.664 --> 34:00.791
<i>Captain, come and take a look at this.</i>

34:08.373 --> 34:12.536
Oh, yes.
This is my bowl of rice, all right.

34:12.610 --> 34:14.545
This'll do quite nicely.

34:14.612 --> 34:16.706
<i>Look at him.</i>

34:16.782 --> 34:18.373
Pretty little porpoise.

34:18.449 --> 34:22.909
Nature in all its glorious splendor.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.681
Put the barbies over there.

34:27.759 --> 34:30.420
We'll fill the sand
with beach chairs...

34:30.495 --> 34:32.985
and we sell piña coladas
for 10 bucks a pop.

34:33.065 --> 34:34.998
Shh, Freddie.

34:35.067 --> 34:38.867
<i>You promised everyone a private island,
Captain, and that's exactly what they're getting.</i>

34:38.937 --> 34:43.135
Corporates are gonna love it.
This'll be their own private Buccaneer paradise.

34:43.208 --> 34:46.574
<i>- "Buccaneer paradise"?
- Excellent.</i>

34:46.645 --> 34:49.239
<i>We come back in two days.</i>

34:49.313 --> 34:51.440
<i>How great would a hotel look
right there?</i>

34:51.516 --> 34:53.848
<i>Strip all the trees back.
Perfect.</i>

34:53.918 --> 34:56.012
Back in two days.

35:07.499 --> 35:11.560
Jack?

35:11.637 --> 35:13.969
Jack, come in.

35:14.039 --> 35:16.507
Daddy!

35:16.575 --> 35:19.601
<i>Daddy, where are you?</i>

35:19.678 --> 35:22.044
<i>I need you.</i>

35:34.993 --> 35:39.430
<i>" Who are you, Nim?
How old are you?</i>

35:41.133 --> 35:43.897
Are you all alone
wherever you are?"

35:55.013 --> 35:58.949
"Yes. I'm all alone.
I'm 11, and my father's gone.

35:59.017 --> 36:01.144
"He's lost at sea.

36:01.219 --> 36:03.619
"And my leg is swollen
and bleeding.

36:03.689 --> 36:06.783
And the Buccaneers are coming
to take over the island. Nim."

36:09.094 --> 36:13.588
What can I possibly do, Nim?

36:13.665 --> 36:16.065
<i>What can I possibly do, Nim?</i>

36:23.575 --> 36:24.906
<i>Come.</i>

36:24.976 --> 36:27.638
Come?

36:27.713 --> 36:30.238
I can't do this all by myself.

36:30.315 --> 36:33.773
I can't be the hero of my own story.

36:33.852 --> 36:36.218
I need you, Alex Rover.

36:37.222 --> 36:40.919
Please. Help me.

36:40.992 --> 36:43.825
<i>Help me, please.</i>

36:47.065 --> 36:48.999
I'm sorry.

36:49.067 --> 36:53.970
I wish I could come,
but I'm a borderline agoraphobic.

36:54.039 --> 36:57.475
Borderline? Is that what you're callin' it?

36:59.845 --> 37:02.575
You're not actually
gonna send that, are you?

37:04.216 --> 37:06.150
I'm sorry.

37:06.218 --> 37:10.382
I wish I could come,
but I'm borderline agoraphobic.

37:11.723 --> 37:14.954
I haven't even left
my apartment in 16 weeks.

37:17.295 --> 37:20.628
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

37:20.699 --> 37:23.065
You're one of the greatest
adventurers who ever lived!

37:23.135 --> 37:25.069
You're Alex Rover!

37:26.671 --> 37:29.970
But I'm not that Alex Rover.

37:30.041 --> 37:33.977
Yeah, you're definitely not.

37:34.045 --> 37:36.741
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

37:36.815 --> 37:39.147
Uh, me?
That's really, really not important.

37:39.217 --> 37:41.447
What's important is that
there's a little girl...

37:41.520 --> 37:45.388
and she's all alone somewhere deep
in the middle of the South Pacific...

37:45.457 --> 37:48.756
and, well, she-she-she's
badly injured herself...

37:48.827 --> 37:51.990
and I feel- I feel quite
responsible for this.

37:52.063 --> 37:54.759
Excuse me. Did you say "South Pacific"?

37:54.833 --> 37:56.767
Yes, yes, I did.

37:56.835 --> 37:59.497
I'm sorry. We serve only the greater
San Francisco Bay area.

37:59.571 --> 38:02.802
<i>- Suva Department of Interior.
- Suva, Fiji Islands.</i>

38:02.874 --> 38:06.105
- Fiji, yeah.
- Uh, there's a little girl on a remote island...

38:06.178 --> 38:11.480
- somewhere near you, I think.
- There are 331 islands comprise Fiji, ma'am.

38:12.951 --> 38:16.114
<i>"Nim, where are you exactly?"</i>

38:18.890 --> 38:21.882
Dear Alex Rover...

38:21.960 --> 38:27.921
our island is 20 degrees south,
162 degrees west...

38:27.999 --> 38:30.524
in the south Asiatic Sea.

38:30.602 --> 38:33.400
<i>- Don't share my location-

38:33.472 --> 38:36.703
"My dad would be devastated
if the world discovered our secret home.

38:36.775 --> 38:39.539
But I'm scared to be all alone. Nim."

38:45.050 --> 38:47.075
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

38:47.152 --> 38:49.086
Go.

38:49.154 --> 38:52.954
Twenty degrees south,
162 degrees west.

38:53.024 --> 38:56.790
I can't even leave my apartment. I can't-
I-I can't go to the south Asiatic Sea!

38:56.862 --> 39:00.423
It's just along the road.
Alex, she needs you.

39:01.433 --> 39:04.596
I don't even know her.

39:04.669 --> 39:07.263
What don't you know?
That she's a little girl?

39:07.339 --> 39:11.400
That she's alone on an island,
and that she's askin' for your help.

39:11.476 --> 39:14.411
<i>Be the hero
of your own life story.</i>

39:14.479 --> 39:16.447
Don't throw that line at me.
I wrote that line.

39:16.515 --> 39:19.450
Oh, I know. Why don't you
follow it for a change then?

39:19.518 --> 39:22.749
Come on. Let's get out
of this damned apartment.

39:22.821 --> 39:26.348
Let's go on an adventure!
Come on a road trip with me.

39:26.424 --> 39:30.588
<i>Hey, you never know.
You might even enjoy it.</i>

39:41.606 --> 39:43.540
I need you, Alex Rover.

39:43.608 --> 39:47.510
Oh, I really am losing my mind.

39:50.982 --> 39:53.974
<i>Dear Nim.
After some serious soul-searching...</i>

39:54.052 --> 39:59.319
<i>I've decided to travel to
20 degrees south, 162 degrees west.</i>

39:59.391 --> 40:02.758
<i>Sadly, the only flight I could get
leaves San Francisco at midnight...</i>

40:02.827 --> 40:05.625
<i>and makes some
unusual connections.</i>

40:05.697 --> 40:10.964
<i>I cannot say for sure when I'm arriving,
but please know that I am on my way.</i>

40:11.036 --> 40:16.633
<i>If for some reason I never arrive,
it probably means... I'm lost at sea.</i>

40:16.708 --> 40:18.835
<i>Sincerely, Alex Rover.</i>

40:20.912 --> 40:23.574
Alex Rover is coming?

40:23.648 --> 40:26.344
<i>Selkie, he's coming!
He's on his way!</i>

40:35.193 --> 40:37.957
I can't do it. I can't go.

40:39.998 --> 40:44.526
Frankly, I'm amazed you made it this far.

40:44.603 --> 40:47.094
Yeah, probably best
that you don't go.

40:47.172 --> 40:50.039
I mean, after all-

40:50.108 --> 40:53.373
It was me she asked for,
wasn't it? Not you.

40:53.445 --> 40:56.073
But, unfortunately,
you're not real.

40:57.082 --> 40:59.516
I am to you.

41:00.852 --> 41:03.150
Come on.

41:14.065 --> 41:17.660
- Open the door, Alexandra.
- You can't make me.

41:18.737 --> 41:20.671
No, you're right. I can't.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.707
You have to do it
for yourself.

41:24.609 --> 41:26.167
<i>- Go on.
- Uh-uh.</i>

41:26.244 --> 41:29.372
- Now, turn the knob.
- Uh-uh.

41:29.447 --> 41:32.041
Yeah.
You can do it.

41:45.463 --> 41:49.490
Yes! Whoo!

41:50.568 --> 41:52.661
Let's go save that little girl.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.774
Take my hand, Alexandra.

41:57.842 --> 41:59.867
No.

41:59.944 --> 42:03.937
- Touch the world.
- I don't wanna touch the world.

42:04.015 --> 42:05.949
I-It's not sanitary.

42:06.017 --> 42:10.420
- Come on!
- Stop pulling!

42:10.488 --> 42:12.183
<i>Quit it!</i>

42:14.959 --> 42:20.898
- Quit it!
- What the-

42:20.965 --> 42:24.731
- Ow! Ow!
- What are you afraid of?

42:24.803 --> 42:28.739
Everything!

42:39.984 --> 42:43.818
You all right there, lady?

42:43.888 --> 42:46.015
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just-

42:46.091 --> 42:48.286
I'm thrilled to be
getting some fresh air.

42:48.359 --> 42:51.226
Can-Can-Can you just
hold-hold- hold on?

42:57.602 --> 43:02.301
I'm just a little-
I'm a little prone to motion sickness.

43:02.373 --> 43:04.534
We're not movin' yet.

43:04.609 --> 43:08.568
Yeah, well, it-it's really the-
It's really the idea of motion that sickens me.

43:10.682 --> 43:12.411
<i>This is what we gotta do, Freddie.</i>

43:12.484 --> 43:15.749
We have to keep 'em in the bay.
Now, Alex Rover's on his way.

43:15.820 --> 43:17.913
<i>We've just gotta hold them
off our beach.</i>

43:17.989 --> 43:21.447
It's pure and simple. Lines of defense,
like the Peloponnesians.

43:21.526 --> 43:24.188
They're ancient Greek warriors.

43:24.262 --> 43:27.595
It's all there in the World Book.

43:35.607 --> 43:38.576
<i>Galileo, you're just in time!</i>

43:39.577 --> 43:42.375
<i>We need you.
We're being invaded.</i>

43:42.447 --> 43:45.939
<i>Now it's all hands on deck.
Everybody's helping out.</i>

43:47.919 --> 43:50.513
Wait, wait.
Galileo.

43:50.588 --> 43:53.614
Galileo, no! What are you doing?
Galileo, come back!

43:53.691 --> 43:55.989
I need those!

43:56.060 --> 43:57.857
Those were my tools!

44:14.279 --> 44:16.213
Shoes, ma'am.

44:16.281 --> 44:19.409
Ahh. Shoes?
That's disgusting.

44:21.619 --> 44:23.678
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

44:25.390 --> 44:27.324
Turn around, please.

44:29.961 --> 44:32.657
We got a hot one!
Bag check!

44:35.266 --> 44:38.827
What's this?

44:38.903 --> 44:41.167
I-I-It's for my soup.

44:41.239 --> 44:42.763
- Not allowed.
- B-

44:42.841 --> 44:44.934
How am I supposed to open it?
With my teeth?

44:45.009 --> 44:48.206
- What are these?
- Oh, that's-that's hand sanitizer.

44:48.279 --> 44:51.407
- It's-It's an excellent, excellent product.
- Not allowed.

44:51.482 --> 44:53.109
- You should use this in your line of work.
- I'm sorry.

44:53.184 --> 44:56.244
- No liquids greater than three ounces allowed.
- B-But I-

44:56.321 --> 44:58.050
Next!

45:06.931 --> 45:09.627
Oh, no! No! No!

45:09.701 --> 45:11.931
Don't!
Don't die on me!

45:17.175 --> 45:20.167
Oh, shoot.

45:38.062 --> 45:41.463
<i>My tool belt.</i>

45:44.102 --> 45:45.262
<i>Galileo?</i>

45:45.336 --> 45:48.965
Galileo. Thank you.

45:51.309 --> 45:56.576
There's hope for Jack yet,
you lousy sharks!

45:56.814 --> 46:02.047
<i>Oh, my God, it's so hot in here.
It's like a Turkish bath.</i>

46:02.120 --> 46:05.021
Are you finding it
excessively hot in here?

46:05.089 --> 46:08.650
I already answered you that, miss.
It's very comfortable to me.

46:08.726 --> 46:11.456
Oh. Excuse me. Um, just-just-
Last time, I promise.

46:11.529 --> 46:13.520
<i>- What is it now, ma'am?
- Um-</i>

46:13.598 --> 46:17.295
Do you happen to have any way
of heating up Progresso soup?

46:17.368 --> 46:20.303
You know, I'm not much of
a traveler, but, uh-

46:20.371 --> 46:22.464
They confiscated
my opener at the airport.

46:22.540 --> 46:26.203
My arm!

46:26.277 --> 46:29.337
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's fine. It's just minor turbulence, okay?

46:29.414 --> 46:31.746
- It's fine.
- Minor turbulence. That's right.

46:31.816 --> 46:34.478
Uh, you know what? I-I'm just gonna-
Just one second. I'm gonna-

46:34.552 --> 46:37.316
But- I- I'm just gonna
do this one-

46:37.388 --> 46:41.484
I-If you don't mind,
I'll just scoot right by you.

46:41.559 --> 46:43.493
'Scuse me.

46:43.561 --> 46:47.827
Oh.

46:47.899 --> 46:50.732
Oh, airplanes.

46:50.802 --> 46:53.134
There's nothing good about airplanes,
except the peanuts.

46:53.204 --> 46:56.332
Am I allergic to peanuts?

46:56.407 --> 46:59.467
What was I possibly thinking?

46:59.544 --> 47:05.346
<i>You were thinking, " Wanderlust,
adventure, frequent flier miles. "</i>

47:05.416 --> 47:07.475
Can I just have a little privacy
in the bathroom?

47:07.552 --> 47:10.487
I mean, I mean, please.
Is nothing sacred?

47:12.357 --> 47:16.555
- What are these?
- Motion sickness pills.

47:18.563 --> 47:21.327
Don't they make you drowsy?

47:22.834 --> 47:25.860
Drowsy.

47:30.608 --> 47:33.372
Miss Rover? Miss Rover?
Miss Rover?

47:33.444 --> 47:36.208
- Wha-
- We're here. We're in Borneo.

47:36.280 --> 47:40.614
Oh, but I don't wanna be in Borneo.
I wanna be in Rarotonga.

47:40.685 --> 47:44.917
Well, your connecting flight to Rarotonga
leaves from Gate F-71 in-

47:44.989 --> 47:48.186
- in 12 minutes.
- Okay.

47:48.259 --> 47:50.193
- Do you want a hand or anything?
- No. I'm... good.

47:50.261 --> 47:51.751
Okay.

47:51.829 --> 47:54.889
- 'Scuse me. Sorry.
- Hey!

47:58.569 --> 48:01.470
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

48:01.539 --> 48:03.803
I-I didn't mean to.
I gotta go, though.

48:08.212 --> 48:11.045
No, no, wait.
Wait, how-

48:11.115 --> 48:14.346
I think there's been
some mistake. I'm- Um-

48:14.419 --> 48:16.580
I-I'm supposed to be
on the plane to Rarotonga.

48:16.654 --> 48:18.554
Oh, yes. No mistake.

48:18.623 --> 48:20.614
Well-Well- No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

48:20.691 --> 48:24.491
Expedia specifically said to me that
I would be on the big plane to Rarotonga.

48:24.562 --> 48:26.655
Oh, this is the big
plane to Rarotonga.

48:26.731 --> 48:30.326
Oh, this is the big plane
to Rarotonga. Oh.

48:30.401 --> 48:32.926
Isn't that funny?
Alex Rover.

48:33.004 --> 48:34.904
Same name
as great adventure hero.

48:34.972 --> 48:37.702
Yes. It's hilarious.

48:46.517 --> 48:49.782
Okay. First, the most important thing
is that they don't know we're here.

48:49.854 --> 48:53.346
<i>Kill that fire.
We'll cover the path too.</i>

48:53.424 --> 48:55.619
<i>We have to make this place seem horrible...</i>

48:55.693 --> 48:58.992
<i>the last place anybody
would wanna be.</i>

48:59.063 --> 49:02.157
When Jack gets back,
I'm telling him I protected this island.

49:02.233 --> 49:07.136
We can take 'em, Selk. We have no choice.

49:12.110 --> 49:14.203
No fire tonight, guys.

49:14.278 --> 49:16.610
No fire and no light.

49:16.681 --> 49:18.672
Nobody can know
that we're here.

49:22.887 --> 49:26.152
Come on, guys.
Nobody's out there.

49:26.224 --> 49:29.022
We'll just all close our eyes.

49:40.438 --> 49:43.032
Oh, please.
Please don't take me now.

49:43.107 --> 49:47.203
I promise that if I survive this,
I will never leave the house again.

49:47.278 --> 49:51.044
I promise I will only listen
to my deepest fears and doubts.

49:54.685 --> 49:59.213
<i>Orion is there,
and-and this is April.</i>

49:59.290 --> 50:03.659
Then I must be
nine degrees north of-

50:03.728 --> 50:07.186
There's a shipping lane through-

50:07.265 --> 50:09.233
What?
Am I too far north?

50:11.402 --> 50:13.370
Yeah, maybe you're right.

50:13.437 --> 50:15.701
I mean, you know
your stars, Galileo.

50:26.817 --> 50:28.751
Emily?

50:30.321 --> 50:32.255
Is it you?

50:35.059 --> 50:38.927
I will get back to her, Emily!
I- I swear it!

50:38.996 --> 50:41.658
I will take care of Nim!

50:46.837 --> 50:48.771
Emily?

50:57.348 --> 51:02.217
<i>Look at 'em. I promised Jack
no one gets on our sand.</i>

51:02.286 --> 51:04.686
Courage is something
you find every day.

51:05.790 --> 51:07.724
Selkie, wake up!

51:07.792 --> 51:11.057
<i>Today's the day we fight
for our piece of the world.</i>

51:11.128 --> 51:13.824
<i>This is our island!</i>

51:13.898 --> 51:17.800
Oh, it's fantastic.
Amazing!

51:17.868 --> 51:20.098
<i>Check it out, Dad.
Totally undiscovered.</i>

51:20.171 --> 51:23.470
<i>Course it's discovered, Edmund.
Cruise line done discovered it.</i>

51:23.541 --> 51:25.566
- Come on, Eddie.
- Wait, Mum.

51:25.643 --> 51:28.578
My dollar's not up yet.
Let me take one more squiz.

51:28.646 --> 51:30.580
<i>What the-</i>

51:30.648 --> 51:33.446
Quick, Mum!
Give me another dollar!

51:33.517 --> 51:35.781
- I think I saw a mermaid!
- Come on, Edmund.

51:35.853 --> 51:38.344
Now, move it!
The tender is leaving!

51:38.422 --> 51:41.619
- But the mermaid!
- Come on. Zip it! Here's your hat.

51:41.692 --> 51:44.627
Honey bunny, come on!
It's leaving.

51:48.099 --> 51:50.090
Uh, no, no, no.

51:50.167 --> 51:53.159
I'm- I'm looking for, uh, Fire Mountain.
Uh, there's a volcano there.

51:53.237 --> 51:56.229
Two hamburger. Two hamburger.
Two hamburgers.

51:56.307 --> 51:58.969
- Oh, no, no. That's not a hamburger. Trust me.
- One dollar.

51:59.043 --> 52:01.511
- Oh, you look beautiful.
- One dollar bangle. Very cheap.

52:01.579 --> 52:03.274
Aah.

52:03.347 --> 52:06.180
- Goat. Goat. You need goat.
- No, no, no.

52:06.250 --> 52:08.878
I-I-I don't need a goat.
You-You need that goat.

52:08.953 --> 52:11.854
<i>You should wash your hands
before you touch anything else.</i>

52:11.922 --> 52:15.824
- Buy from me! Buy from me!
- I can't. I need Fire Mountain.

52:15.893 --> 52:18.225
- I know what you need. I take you.
- You know Fire Mountain?

52:18.296 --> 52:21.788
It's 20 degrees south
and 162 degrees west.

52:21.866 --> 52:24.198
- I know what you need. I take you.
- Okay. Um-

52:24.268 --> 52:26.259
- I know.
- All right. I'll get in.

52:26.337 --> 52:29.238
- Toothbrush. Your very own toothbrush!
- I don't need any toothbrushes.

52:29.307 --> 52:31.366
I always bring my own.
Thank you.

52:31.442 --> 52:34.707
You can use that for yourself.
Your own teeth. Brush, brush.

52:34.779 --> 52:37.339
Okay. Thank you.
Good-bye.

52:38.416 --> 52:40.384
<i>Wait! Are you-</i>

52:40.451 --> 52:42.646
Are-Are you positive that
you know where you're going?

52:42.720 --> 52:44.881
I know what you need.
I take you.

52:44.955 --> 52:49.187
You wouldn't happen to have any hand sanitizer
up there amongst all those Coke cans, would you?

52:49.260 --> 52:51.091
I know what you need.
I take you.

52:51.162 --> 52:53.926
That's all you know how to say,
isn't it?

52:53.998 --> 52:56.432
I know what you need.
I take you.

53:00.071 --> 53:02.005
Trust, Alex.

53:02.073 --> 53:04.234
Trust, trust.
That's easy for you to say.

53:04.308 --> 53:07.175
Trust is the secret to adventure.

53:07.244 --> 53:10.839
<i>Chapter four, The Trek to Kilimanjaro.</i>

53:10.915 --> 53:13.349
<i>- Can't you come up with anything more original?
- Boat!</i>

53:13.417 --> 53:16.978
- What you need. Boat!
- Ah. See?

53:17.054 --> 53:20.387
What did I tell you?

53:27.998 --> 53:30.262
<i>They've come to the wrong place.</i>

53:30.334 --> 53:33.030
<i>Nobody invades my island
and gets away with it.</i>

53:33.104 --> 53:35.732
Okay, Selk.
Go get 'em now.

53:35.806 --> 53:40.368
<i>Gas 'em out. Teach 'em what happens when
chunks of dead fish and plantains mix together.</i>

53:45.850 --> 53:48.648
<i>A picture-perfect paradise.</i>

53:48.719 --> 53:51.153
What's that down there?

53:51.222 --> 53:54.385
<i>Some kind of
underwater geyser, maybe.</i>

53:57.561 --> 54:01.258
Oh, my God. What's that filthy smell?

54:04.668 --> 54:07.967
Rancid! Oh!

54:08.038 --> 54:12.236
<i>- Turn this boat around.
- It's horrible! I'm going to vomit.</i>

54:13.644 --> 54:15.942
Hey, look! It's a sea lion.

54:16.013 --> 54:19.278
Look at him. Our very own welcoming committee.

54:19.350 --> 54:21.147
<i>Smells fresher over here.</i>

54:21.218 --> 54:23.880
You gave it your best, Selk.

54:23.954 --> 54:25.922
Jack, where are you?

54:46.510 --> 54:49.343
Keep your eyes
on the horizon.

54:49.413 --> 54:53.509
Keep your eyes on the horizon,
eyes on the horizon. Then you won't vomit.

54:53.584 --> 54:56.553
Eyes on the horizon. Eyes on the-

55:00.791 --> 55:02.850
I'll take you as far
as Tuvalu Island.

55:02.927 --> 55:05.691
- That is as far as the little boat goes.
- Okay.

55:05.763 --> 55:08.288
But-Wh-What's that?

55:08.365 --> 55:11.163
<i>That? Ah.
That is a monsoon.</i>

55:11.235 --> 55:14.636
<i>You-You mean, like a-
like a monsoon monsoon?</i>

55:14.705 --> 55:17.936
<i>Storm wants to come this way.
The sky won't let it.</i>

55:18.008 --> 55:22.172
- And I trust my sky.
- "I trust my sky."

55:22.246 --> 55:25.113
That's a very good line. You know,
I might steal that. I'm a writer.

55:25.182 --> 55:27.309
No, no. My line. I'm a writer too.

55:27.384 --> 55:30.251
- I use line in my story.
- Yeah?

55:30.321 --> 55:33.552
Well. Okay. That's fine.
It's all yours.

55:38.095 --> 55:41.394
No! Hey!

55:49.640 --> 55:53.940
<i>Mateys and wenches,
Buccaneer Olympics in half an hour!</i>

56:03.487 --> 56:05.751
<i>All right, all right. There you go.</i>

56:05.823 --> 56:09.190
What are those little houses
they brought with them?

56:09.260 --> 56:11.421
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

56:11.495 --> 56:15.363
<i>the porta-potties are
now open for business.</i>

56:19.537 --> 56:21.471
Drop the volleyball.

56:21.539 --> 56:23.370
My telly.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.465
<i>Edmund, don't go too far.</i>

56:25.543 --> 56:28.068
<i>You don't know what sort of
horrible creatures are in there.</i>

56:28.145 --> 56:30.238
<i>There are no horrible creatures, Mum.</i>

56:33.350 --> 56:36.945
- Aah.
- Shh, Fred. Not yet.

56:37.021 --> 56:39.216
No one can know
that we're here.

56:46.363 --> 56:51.130
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off me!

56:51.201 --> 56:54.830
Dragon! I saw a dragon!

56:56.373 --> 56:58.773
Help! Flying dragons!
Help!

56:58.842 --> 57:00.833
<i>- Edmund, where were you?
- Help!</i>

57:00.911 --> 57:02.936
What's wrong with
that boy now, Shirley?

57:03.013 --> 57:06.244
<i>The scavenger hunt in 20 minutes.</i>

57:06.317 --> 57:10.276
<i>Any mateys or wenches who
want to explore the island...</i>

57:10.354 --> 57:12.151
<i>20 minutes.</i>

57:14.224 --> 57:16.249
No, don't worry about me, Fred.
I'm okay.

57:16.327 --> 57:19.387
Time for the second wave.
Call to your friends. Come on now.

57:39.583 --> 57:41.551
Oh!

57:45.623 --> 57:48.990
Come on. Move it.
Let me at it, kid.

57:52.229 --> 57:56.165
Okay. Are you ready to really fly, Freddie?

58:11.882 --> 58:14.680
Bury my lollies!
It's on me!

58:14.752 --> 58:17.846
<i>Oh, what is it?</i>

58:17.921 --> 58:21.914
- Shirley, help me! Aah!
- Dragons! Flying dragons!

58:35.839 --> 58:37.898
Dragons!

58:45.182 --> 58:49.414
<i>Oh, they're just lizards, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

58:49.486 --> 58:51.181
They roam all over
these islands.

58:51.255 --> 58:53.348
But, uh, how many lizards
can fly, Captain?

59:10.607 --> 59:14.065
To the boats now.
Come on. Be gone with you.

59:14.144 --> 59:17.944
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, do not fear!
Lizards are afraid of fire!</i>

59:18.015 --> 59:23.043
It's just nature,
and we know how to tame it!

59:23.120 --> 59:27.955
<i>Everyone, please! I'd like to introduce
the world-famous Buccaneer Dancers!</i>

59:55.385 --> 59:58.684
Tuvalu Island.
You walk from here.

59:58.756 --> 01:00:01.190
What? I-I walk?

01:00:01.258 --> 01:00:04.694
Uh, it's-That's like
a hundred yards offshore.

01:00:04.762 --> 01:00:06.923
I mean, you-you said to Tuvalu.

01:00:06.997 --> 01:00:09.261
This is-
This is Tuvalu adjacent.

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:11.597
<i>Little boat go no farther.
Bad for motor.</i>

01:00:11.668 --> 01:00:15.035
Uh- Uh, you ca-
You can't be serious.

01:00:15.105 --> 01:00:17.198
- Come on. Off you go.
- This is just-

01:00:17.274 --> 01:00:19.936
This is-This is-
This is insanity.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:22.706
I know- I know a little
thing about insanity, let me tell ya.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.714
Oh, God.

01:00:24.782 --> 01:00:27.546
<i>Man with a helicopter live here.
He'll take you the rest of the way.</i>

01:00:27.618 --> 01:00:30.086
<i>- But I-
- You find that man with the helicopter.</i>

01:00:30.154 --> 01:00:33.612
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait. Don't you know
what the safety ratings are on those things?

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.557
I can't take a helicopter.
I need to go back right now.

01:00:36.627 --> 01:00:38.686
Come on. Right now!

01:00:38.762 --> 01:00:42.391
- Hey! I-I'm reporting you to, uh-
- So long! Good luck!

01:00:42.466 --> 01:00:45.731
<i>someone!</i>

01:00:45.803 --> 01:00:48.067
Now you're up to
your waist in it.

01:00:48.138 --> 01:00:50.368
- The beautiful ocean.
- Ah!

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.931
The salt water.
Doesn't it feel just great?

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:56.241
No. No. It doesn't feel just-
great.

01:00:56.313 --> 01:00:59.009
It doesn't even feel good.
It feels like the wet, disgusting, fishy and-

01:00:59.082 --> 01:01:03.018
Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Take me back!

01:01:03.086 --> 01:01:05.077
Ach! Away with ya, Alexandra.

01:01:05.155 --> 01:01:08.249
This is it!
You're tasting adventure.

01:01:11.195 --> 01:01:13.720
It tastes bad.

01:01:16.266 --> 01:01:18.530
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:01:18.602 --> 01:01:21.070
- Have you seen Edmund?
- No.

01:01:21.138 --> 01:01:23.072
Edmund!

01:01:28.912 --> 01:01:31.938
Eddie! Are you in there?

01:01:32.015 --> 01:01:33.983
<i>Play nicely now!</i>

01:01:34.051 --> 01:01:36.110
This is no place for games!

01:01:36.186 --> 01:01:38.711
It's the perfect place
for games!

01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:41.053
Edmund!

01:01:49.266 --> 01:01:52.099
<i>Look up there.</i>

01:01:52.169 --> 01:01:54.729
What's that?

01:01:54.805 --> 01:01:57.774
<i>Yes! Smoke!</i>

01:01:57.841 --> 01:02:00.867
Act like a volcano!

01:02:12.155 --> 01:02:15.283
What is it?
Is it erupting?

01:02:26.703 --> 01:02:28.967
Is that an avalanche?

01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:42.882
Come on.

01:02:44.054 --> 01:02:46.522
No. No. Wrong way!

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.794
Wow.

01:02:53.897 --> 01:02:57.628
Shirley? Shirley!

01:02:57.701 --> 01:02:59.760
Oh.

01:03:11.515 --> 01:03:13.983
Whoa. Did I do that?

01:03:17.688 --> 01:03:19.952
- Geez!
- Edmund!

01:03:21.692 --> 01:03:25.355
<i>Off we go! Don't panic.</i>

01:03:25.429 --> 01:03:28.728
It's part of the experience.
Back onto the boats.

01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:30.733
<i>- Edmund, hurry up!
- Let's move!</i>

01:03:30.801 --> 01:03:33.065
The-The thing's going!
Hurry up!

01:03:46.783 --> 01:03:48.774
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:03:50.387 --> 01:03:52.981
What were you
doing up there?

01:03:54.458 --> 01:03:57.825
- Do you live here?
- Yes, I live here.

01:03:57.894 --> 01:04:00.385
What are you doing here?

01:04:00.464 --> 01:04:03.433
We're supposed to be on holiday.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.764
Calm down!
Ludwig, get on the boat.

01:04:05.836 --> 01:04:08.737
<i>Get us out of here.</i>

01:04:08.805 --> 01:04:11.103
<i>- Hurry!
- Shirley!</i>

01:04:11.174 --> 01:04:14.371
- Come on! Where's our boy? Get the boy!
- I don't know! Edmund!

01:04:14.444 --> 01:04:16.878
Edmund, now!

01:04:18.281 --> 01:04:21.250
You're different
than I imagined you.

01:04:22.486 --> 01:04:25.250
You-You imagined me?

01:04:25.322 --> 01:04:28.758
<i>From the story,
Buccaneer Ship?</i>

01:04:28.825 --> 01:04:31.419
"The Oceanographer
and the Blue Whale."

01:04:31.495 --> 01:04:33.486
But I'm not from a story.

01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:44.568
<i>Edmund! Hurry up!</i>

01:04:44.641 --> 01:04:46.472
I'm from Brisbane.

01:04:46.543 --> 01:04:48.477
- Edmund!
- Edmund!

01:04:48.545 --> 01:04:51.946
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen, do not panic.
- Edmund!</i>

01:04:52.015 --> 01:04:54.745
Edmund!

01:04:54.818 --> 01:04:57.218
<i>Edmund! Hurry!</i>

01:04:57.287 --> 01:05:00.654
- It's time for you to leave now.
- Are you coming with us?

01:05:00.724 --> 01:05:04.319
- Why?
- It's not safe here.

01:05:04.394 --> 01:05:07.830
- But it's safe for me.
- But you're all alone.

01:05:09.699 --> 01:05:12.429
<i>Hurry up!</i>

01:05:12.502 --> 01:05:14.902
<i>Edmund!</i>

01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:17.235
Coming, Mother.

01:05:21.645 --> 01:05:24.808
<i>Edmund! Eddie?</i>

01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:27.782
Eddie, baby,
where have you been?

01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:30.183
We've been looking for you everywhere.
We've gotta get out of here.

01:05:30.253 --> 01:05:32.687
I met a girl!
Mum, I met a girl!

01:05:32.756 --> 01:05:36.021
Met a girl on this godforsaken island?
I'm happy for you.

01:05:36.093 --> 01:05:39.620
- A girl who lives here.
- Oh, you and your stories, Eddie!

01:05:39.696 --> 01:05:42.529
This island is no place for human beings.
I promise you that.

01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:44.760
Now, come on.
Wait for us! Please!

01:05:44.835 --> 01:05:47.599
<i>- Wait for us!
- We're coming!</i>

01:05:47.671 --> 01:05:49.696
<i>My God! Look at that!</i>

01:05:55.612 --> 01:05:59.013
Move it faster! Come on!

01:05:59.082 --> 01:06:02.984
How old are you now?
Eddie? Eddie?

01:06:03.053 --> 01:06:06.022
No more Game Boy, no more
television for a month.

01:06:06.089 --> 01:06:08.182
He's staying at home
forever.

01:06:15.265 --> 01:06:19.292
Oh, no. Alex Rover, where are you?

01:06:23.773 --> 01:06:26.970
What's happening?

01:06:27.043 --> 01:06:29.136
Storm's changing course!
This is bad!

01:06:29.212 --> 01:06:31.578
- What?
- This is bad!

01:06:31.648 --> 01:06:34.879
Oh! Oh, this is it!
I'm gonna die!

01:06:34.951 --> 01:06:37.977
- I gotta agree with you on that one.
- What?

01:06:38.054 --> 01:06:41.319
Glass bubble hanging a hundred feet
above the middle of nowhere.

01:06:41.391 --> 01:06:45.225
Oh, I hate helicopters.
It's my Achilles' heel.

01:06:45.295 --> 01:06:47.763
You can't say that. You're a hero!

01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:51.494
I'm not a hero. I wish I were.
I'm just a helicopter pilot.

01:06:51.568 --> 01:06:56.096
- Oh!
- No, you're the hero, Alexandra.

01:06:56.173 --> 01:06:58.835
You came all the way down here
just to answer a distress call.

01:06:58.909 --> 01:07:03.369
You-You seized the moment,
claiming control of this part of your life!

01:07:03.446 --> 01:07:06.847
<i>- I'm gonna be sick.
- No, no. No, no, no, no.</i>

01:07:06.917 --> 01:07:09.715
<i>- You can't. Oh!
- What's that?</i>

01:07:12.422 --> 01:07:14.617
I-I think
it's a cruise ship.

01:07:14.691 --> 01:07:18.252
<i>- I'm taking her down. We land there.
- There?</i>

01:07:18.328 --> 01:07:21.525
No!

01:07:28.805 --> 01:07:31.035
South by southeast, full speed.

01:07:31.107 --> 01:07:33.268
Captain, you might
want to see this.

01:07:38.949 --> 01:07:41.247
Good Lord.

01:07:45.689 --> 01:07:49.056
No more!

01:07:49.125 --> 01:07:52.060
No more! No more!

01:07:52.128 --> 01:07:55.393
Oh, thank you!

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.492
Who gave you permission
to land on my ship?

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:03.471
- Who are you?
- I'm Alex Rover.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.838
Alex Rover? The adventurer?

01:08:05.909 --> 01:08:09.606
No! The writer!

01:08:12.315 --> 01:08:16.115
Come on now! Don't let me down here!
You're my last chance!

01:08:16.185 --> 01:08:18.450
Come on! Come on!

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.613
That's it!

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:22.715
Come on!

01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:26.250
You did it!

01:08:26.328 --> 01:08:28.627
<i>Whoo-hoo! Okay. Come on!</i>

01:08:28.698 --> 01:08:33.192
Take me home!
Come on, Mother Nature!

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:35.261
Take me back to Nim!

01:08:36.606 --> 01:08:38.938
Whoo-hoo!

01:08:39.009 --> 01:08:41.773
I know the coordinates perfectly well.
They're right in my head.

01:08:41.845 --> 01:08:44.904
It is, uh, 20 degrees south,
162 degrees west.

01:08:44.981 --> 01:08:46.971
There's a little girl there.

01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:49.314
There's no girl for 200 miles.

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:51.718
<i>Oh, but she's-she's
all alone on an island.</i>

01:08:51.787 --> 01:08:54.221
And but-but what-

01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:56.486
Why is everybody looking at me
like I'm crazy?

01:08:56.559 --> 01:09:00.825
We've just come from the nearest island.
Trust me, no human being could survive there.

01:09:00.897 --> 01:09:01.974
Just take me to the island!

01:09:01.975 --> 01:09:03.889
Young lady, we're battling
a bloody monsoon here.

01:09:03.966 --> 01:09:07.163
Now, this ship is full throttle at sea and
we will not be coming about.

01:09:07.237 --> 01:09:09.205
Uh, but- I-

01:09:09.272 --> 01:09:11.331
Captain, she's not
playing with a full deck.

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:13.808
<i>You should have the medic come
and give her a little sedation.</i>

01:09:13.877 --> 01:09:15.810
<i>- Yeah, why don't you do that, huh?
- Yeah.</i>

01:09:15.879 --> 01:09:17.971
- Eddie?
- He's probably after the dessert tray.

01:09:18.048 --> 01:09:21.711
I know she's there.
You know, I mean, I heard her voice.

01:09:21.785 --> 01:09:24.754
I didn't really hear her voice.
I got her e-mails.

01:09:24.821 --> 01:09:27.448
- You're not crazy.
- I'm not?

01:09:27.524 --> 01:09:30.515
I know it. I saw her.
She's real.

01:09:30.593 --> 01:09:33.858
- She-She's real?
- And she's on the island.

01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:36.524
Oh. Thanks. Thanks.

01:09:36.599 --> 01:09:40.365
The way you are handling it, the poise
with which you are handling this situation-

01:09:40.437 --> 01:09:43.429
- Ship's medic is on his way, Captain.
- Thank you, Ensign.

01:09:46.743 --> 01:09:49.678
- Hey! Hey! After her!
- Security!

01:09:55.652 --> 01:09:58.314
Bingo in five minutes.

01:09:58.388 --> 01:10:00.322
Oh!

01:10:02.125 --> 01:10:04.923
Stop her!
Someone stop her!

01:10:07.664 --> 01:10:11.600
Oh, stupid suitcase!
Oh, you dropped soup.

01:10:11.668 --> 01:10:14.933
<i>- I've got her!
- Come on! Down here!</i>

01:10:15.004 --> 01:10:17.336
<i>Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!</i>

01:10:31.721 --> 01:10:33.712
<i>There she isl</i>

01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:37.385
<i>Don't let her go!</i>

01:10:43.666 --> 01:10:46.294
<i>What on earth are you doing?</i>

01:10:46.369 --> 01:10:50.430
Just having
a nervous breakdown!

01:11:16.065 --> 01:11:17.999
Whoo-hoo!

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.856
No, no, no, no, no.
No, don't do this!

01:11:57.173 --> 01:12:01.405
I will not give up, Nim!
I will get back to you!

01:12:01.478 --> 01:12:03.469
I promise you!

01:12:31.307 --> 01:12:33.241
Daddy?

01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:36.945
Jack?

01:12:53.429 --> 01:12:57.627
Daddy! Daddy!

01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.725
Are you all right, Daddy?

01:12:59.802 --> 01:13:01.599
Jack!

01:13:01.671 --> 01:13:04.765
Selkie, Selkie, come on!
Jack needs us!

01:13:04.841 --> 01:13:08.242
We have to save him!

01:13:26.596 --> 01:13:30.054
Nim? Nim!

01:14:16.779 --> 01:14:20.112
No!

01:15:02.492 --> 01:15:05.620
Nim.

01:15:07.497 --> 01:15:09.897
Is that you? Nim?

01:15:09.966 --> 01:15:13.231
Is that you? Nim.

01:15:15.071 --> 01:15:17.539
Who are you?

01:15:17.607 --> 01:15:20.599
Nim, I'm-
I'm Alex Rover.

01:15:20.677 --> 01:15:23.669
Alex Rover?

01:15:23.746 --> 01:15:26.237
Yeah, that's me.

01:15:26.315 --> 01:15:30.217
But- No.
No, that's impossible.

01:15:30.286 --> 01:15:34.723
Alex Rover, he's a man.
He's a hero.

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:37.851
He was gonna help me
find my dad.

01:15:37.927 --> 01:15:40.725
He saves people.
He doesn't need saving.

01:15:40.797 --> 01:15:43.425
I-I know.

01:15:43.499 --> 01:15:46.866
<i>I'm-I'm Alexandra Rover.</i>

01:15:48.104 --> 01:15:50.572
Alexandra?

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.336
I'm the writer
from San Francisco.

01:15:53.409 --> 01:15:56.810
- The writer?
- Yeah. Well, you said you needed someone, so-

01:15:56.879 --> 01:15:58.972
But I didn't say I needed you.

01:15:59.048 --> 01:16:02.984
- You have to go.
- What are you talking about? I mean, I-

01:16:03.052 --> 01:16:05.864
You can't be here. You have
to go before my dad gets back.

01:16:05.865 --> 01:16:06.579
Before your dad-

01:16:06.656 --> 01:16:09.591
This is our island, okay?
Our island alone.

01:16:09.659 --> 01:16:12.822
And we don't want
anyone else here! Okay?

01:16:12.895 --> 01:16:16.296
Please go. Go!

01:16:25.341 --> 01:16:28.242
Follow her, Alexandra.

01:16:28.311 --> 01:16:32.338
- You-You be quiet.
- No, I won't be quiet. She needs you.

01:16:32.415 --> 01:16:35.782
What? She's- She's fine.
I mean, you heard her.

01:16:35.852 --> 01:16:38.787
Apparently, she can do quite well.
She doesn't need me.

01:16:38.855 --> 01:16:40.846
Of course she needs you.

01:16:40.923 --> 01:16:43.289
And to be honest,
you kinda need her as well.

01:16:43.359 --> 01:16:45.759
I mean,
where you gonna go?

01:16:45.828 --> 01:16:49.423
But I- I'm gettin' outta here.
I'm gonna-

01:16:49.499 --> 01:16:53.265
I'm gonna make a raft. I'm gonna,
like, make a little bonfire thing.

01:16:53.336 --> 01:16:56.999
And-And then I'm gonna go home,
and I'm- I am never leaving.

01:16:57.073 --> 01:16:59.837
You cannot be alone
for the rest of your life, Alexandra!

01:16:59.909 --> 01:17:03.777
I'm not alone. I have you.

01:17:05.281 --> 01:17:08.682
No, you don't.
No, you don't have me anymore.

01:17:11.053 --> 01:17:14.216
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna be
your crutch anymore.

01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:18.192
What?

01:17:18.261 --> 01:17:21.355
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Okay, look.

01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:25.093
You-We just need to figure this thing out,
so you give me some ideas now. Come on.

01:17:25.168 --> 01:17:28.626
- I'm sorry, love. It's over.
- What? What are you talking about?

01:17:28.704 --> 01:17:31.070
Alexandra, I quit.

01:17:32.775 --> 01:17:35.608
No more adventures.

01:17:35.678 --> 01:17:38.306
- You're on your own.
- You-You-You can't quit.

01:17:38.381 --> 01:17:43.546
I created you, and you have to do
what I say, not-not the opposite.

01:17:43.619 --> 01:17:47.783
Good-bye, old friend.
Good luck.

01:17:47.857 --> 01:17:51.918
But wa-Wait! Wait! Come back!

01:17:51.994 --> 01:17:54.326
Go to the little girl!

01:18:18.354 --> 01:18:21.949
Nim?
Oh! What was that?

01:18:22.024 --> 01:18:25.187
Oh, God. Just kill me now
and just get it over with.

01:18:26.762 --> 01:18:28.696
Oh!

01:18:28.764 --> 01:18:30.698
Eh! Aah.

01:18:30.766 --> 01:18:33.701
Nim? Help!

01:18:33.769 --> 01:18:37.967
<i>Uh, Nim? Help!</i>

01:18:41.143 --> 01:18:45.102
<i>Can you hear me?
It's so dark out here!</i>

01:18:45.181 --> 01:18:47.115
<i>Nim?</i>

01:18:47.183 --> 01:18:50.983
Nim? Come on, help me.

01:18:51.053 --> 01:18:54.819
I traveled halfway around the world.
I took a plane.

01:18:54.891 --> 01:18:58.292
I took a helicopter. I- I stole a boat.

01:18:58.361 --> 01:19:01.262
The least you can do is help me
get the last hundred yards.

01:19:04.233 --> 01:19:06.497
Oh! Oh.

01:19:06.569 --> 01:19:09.333
Nim? Nim.

01:19:09.405 --> 01:19:11.566
I'm sorry
you don't want me here...

01:19:11.641 --> 01:19:15.042
but I- I just thought
I was doin' the right thing.

01:19:17.179 --> 01:19:20.012
<i>Oh. Oh, no.</i>

01:19:20.082 --> 01:19:22.277
<i>Oh, no. Oh.</i>

01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:24.410
<i>This is how it ends.</i>

01:19:24.487 --> 01:19:27.285
A bright light in the darkness.

01:19:27.356 --> 01:19:30.484
My- My worst nightmare-

01:19:30.559 --> 01:19:33.357
Death by-
death by firefly!

01:19:42.972 --> 01:19:45.998
Thank you, Nim.

01:19:48.277 --> 01:19:50.211
Oh!

01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:03.622
<i>How long
have you lived here?</i>

01:20:04.794 --> 01:20:06.819
As long as I can remember.

01:20:06.896 --> 01:20:08.864
Wow.

01:20:10.466 --> 01:20:12.457
You can go in if you want.

01:20:30.553 --> 01:20:32.783
<i>"Jack Rusoe is a scientist
and a writer...</i>

01:20:32.855 --> 01:20:36.814
<i>"living on a remote island
in the South Pacific.</i>

01:20:36.892 --> 01:20:39.360
He won't tell anyone where it is."

01:20:46.969 --> 01:20:49.028
Nim, how long has
your father been gone?

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.574
Four days.

01:20:55.678 --> 01:20:59.671
But when Jack sets his mind
on something, it always gets done.

01:20:59.749 --> 01:21:03.583
- He'll be back.
- I'm sure he will.

01:21:04.787 --> 01:21:06.778
<i>You want any of this?</i>

01:21:07.957 --> 01:21:10.653
What-What is it?

01:21:10.726 --> 01:21:15.425
Well, these are mung beans
and gobo root.

01:21:15.498 --> 01:21:18.524
And these are mealworms.

01:21:19.902 --> 01:21:21.836
<i>Oh, uh-</i>

01:21:21.904 --> 01:21:24.839
No, I'm-You know,
I-I'm just gonna-

01:21:24.907 --> 01:21:26.898
I'm just gonna stick
with my soup.

01:21:26.976 --> 01:21:28.910
Your soup?

01:21:38.721 --> 01:21:40.712
Sorry about that.

01:21:43.392 --> 01:21:45.758
Here. Try some.

01:21:50.266 --> 01:21:52.200
Uh, no.

01:21:54.904 --> 01:21:58.362
You didn't write
those Alex Rover books, did you?

01:22:01.043 --> 01:22:03.807
- I didn't?
- No.

01:22:03.879 --> 01:22:07.645
I mean, all Alex Rover ever does
is try new things all the time.

01:22:14.323 --> 01:22:16.951
Hmm.

01:22:17.026 --> 01:22:18.960
Mmm.

01:22:20.696 --> 01:22:23.529
<i>- Hmm. Mmm.
- So?</i>

01:22:23.599 --> 01:22:25.624
How is it?

01:22:29.004 --> 01:22:31.336
Chewy.

01:22:31.407 --> 01:22:33.671
It's chewier than I'd expected...

01:22:33.742 --> 01:22:38.236
and it's, uh, not disgusting.

01:22:48.624 --> 01:22:50.956
What was I possibly thinking?

01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:31.523
Uh. Oh, okay, okay.

01:23:33.402 --> 01:23:35.336
Nim?

01:23:37.339 --> 01:23:39.273
Nim?

01:23:42.144 --> 01:23:44.078
Nim?

01:24:28.757 --> 01:24:30.691
It's beautiful.

01:24:32.928 --> 01:24:34.862
It's empty.

01:24:38.467 --> 01:24:40.526
Maybe-

01:24:40.603 --> 01:24:42.867
Maybe he's-he's just lost.

01:24:43.973 --> 01:24:45.941
No.

01:24:46.008 --> 01:24:49.808
No, my- my dad
is smarter than that.

01:24:49.878 --> 01:24:53.871
If his boat was all right,
he would be home by now.

01:24:56.085 --> 01:25:00.488
You-You found your way
all the way from San Francisco...

01:25:00.556 --> 01:25:03.047
and you don't know
how to do anything.

01:25:06.028 --> 01:25:09.896
My dad would be back
from Zander's Atoll...

01:25:09.965 --> 01:25:12.195
if he was still alive.

01:25:15.304 --> 01:25:18.000
He's not coming back, Alexandra.

01:25:19.008 --> 01:25:21.602
Oh, look.

01:25:24.246 --> 01:25:26.180
I-

01:25:29.184 --> 01:25:31.152
Listen to me.

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:34.951
No matter what happens...

01:25:35.024 --> 01:25:39.791
whether it's here or anywhere...

01:25:39.862 --> 01:25:41.853
I'll take care of it.

01:25:42.865 --> 01:25:46.858
You-You will not be alone.

01:26:04.787 --> 01:26:07.517
What-

01:26:07.589 --> 01:26:09.580
What-What is that?

01:26:14.496 --> 01:26:15.485
Galileo?

01:26:32.781 --> 01:26:34.749
It's him.

01:26:35.984 --> 01:26:38.714
<i>It's him! Daddy!</i>

01:26:45.461 --> 01:26:47.224
- Come on, get on!
- Oh!

01:26:49.298 --> 01:26:52.461
Whoo!

01:27:04.913 --> 01:27:06.904
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:27:11.887 --> 01:27:14.082
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:27:14.156 --> 01:27:17.455
Daddy! Daddy!

01:27:17.526 --> 01:27:21.587
- Oh. Nimmy! Oh! Oh, my God.
- You're here! You're alive!

01:27:21.663 --> 01:27:24.689
You're-You're alive!

01:27:24.767 --> 01:27:28.726
- I was so worried.
- I told you I'd be back, didn't I?

01:27:28.804 --> 01:27:31.204
Oh. Look at you.

01:27:31.273 --> 01:27:33.798
Oh, I missed you so much. Ah.

01:27:35.144 --> 01:27:38.944
- Are you all right? Yeah?
- I am now.

01:27:39.014 --> 01:27:42.142
<i>Thank you, Galileo!</i>

01:27:42.217 --> 01:27:44.481
<i>- Thank you, Galileo!
- Hoo-hoo!</i>

01:27:44.553 --> 01:27:46.783
<i>What's this?</i>

01:27:46.855 --> 01:27:50.154
- Protozoa Nim?
- I don't know.

01:27:50.225 --> 01:27:52.955
I have a pretty good
feeling about it.

01:27:53.028 --> 01:27:56.759
Come here. Oh.

01:28:03.205 --> 01:28:06.641
- What?
- Hi.

01:28:08.277 --> 01:28:10.211
Who's this?

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.010
Dad, this is Alex Rover.

01:28:14.082 --> 01:28:16.346
Alex Rover? I thought-

01:28:16.418 --> 01:28:19.478
She wrote the books, Dad.

01:28:19.555 --> 01:28:23.047
This is Alexandra Rover,
the writer.

01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:25.116
<i>From San Francisco.</i>

01:28:27.062 --> 01:28:30.793

01:28:33.068 --> 01:28:35.059
Uh, yeah, Jack...

01:28:35.137 --> 01:28:37.332
the scientist, yeah.

01:28:40.542 --> 01:28:42.476
<i>What, Daddy?</i>

01:28:42.544 --> 01:28:44.535
Oh, nothing. I'm sorry.

01:28:44.613 --> 01:28:48.413
I just imagined Alex Rover so...

01:28:48.484 --> 01:28:51.476
well, differently.

01:28:51.553 --> 01:28:55.649

<i>How it ends exactly...</i>

01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.121
