WEBVTT

00:00.950 --> 00:02.362
Previously on Castle...

00:02.363 --> 00:03.313
Tell me what I don't know

00:03.314 --> 00:05.227
about my mom's murder, Detective Raglan.

00:05.228 --> 00:08.767
19 years ago, I... I made a bad mistake,

00:08.768 --> 00:11.130
and that started the dominoes falling,

00:11.339 --> 00:12.687
and one of 'em was your mom.

00:13.846 --> 00:15.258
You woke the dragon,

00:15.259 --> 00:18.135
and this is so much
bigger than you realize.

00:18.136 --> 00:20.709
We gotta find that shooter.
Our shooter is Hal Lockwood.

00:21.349 --> 00:24.397
I need to know exactly
what you know about me

00:24.398 --> 00:25.963
and my employer.

00:30.673 --> 00:34.047
I will be back here week after week

00:34.048 --> 00:36.116
to ask you who hired you.

00:38.242 --> 00:39.984
Hey, guys, I could use a hand.

00:41.133 --> 00:42.848
Thank you. Thanks. That's very funny.

00:42.849 --> 00:45.707
Just for that, you will not be
getting an autographed copy

00:46.090 --> 00:48.391
of my new graphic novel.

00:48.579 --> 00:51.894
You wrote a graphic novel?
Not technically, but it is based on

00:51.895 --> 00:53.690
one of the greatest
characters I ever created.

00:53.691 --> 00:56.324
You see, Wolverine,
Batman, Betty, Veronica--

00:56.489 --> 00:58.826
Sure, they were fine for their day.

00:59.008 --> 01:02.147
But there is a new sheriff
on the spinner rack,

01:02.148 --> 01:03.390
and his name is...

01:03.391 --> 01:04.593
Derrick Storm.

01:04.593 --> 01:07.357
Advance art for "A Deadly Storm,"

01:07.358 --> 01:09.305
the new graphic novel.
Wow.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.753
It's pretty cool.
It's epic cool is what it is.

01:11.754 --> 01:12.934
Where's Beckett? I want to show her this.

01:12.935 --> 01:14.111
Making her weekly pilgrimage

01:14.112 --> 01:15.950
out to the prison to interview Lockwood.

01:17.095 --> 01:17.859
Oh.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.161
Right.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.457 --> 01:37.930
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:38.718 --> 01:40.000
Welcome back, Detective Beckett.

01:40.001 --> 01:41.162
Officer Ryker.

01:41.271 --> 01:43.313
Our special today is serial arsonist.

01:43.856 --> 01:44.815
No, thank you.

01:44.816 --> 01:46.700
Perhaps I can interest
you in an armed robber

01:46.701 --> 01:48.712
covered in gang tats and
protesting his innocence?

01:48.713 --> 01:50.598
Uh, you know, I think I'll
just take the usual--

01:50.923 --> 01:53.219
Hal Lockwood.
That's an excellent choice, madam.

01:53.220 --> 01:55.187
I'll have someone bring him down.
Thank you.

01:57.057 --> 01:59.970
It's Ryker.
I've got a visitor for Lockwood.

01:59.971 --> 02:02.332
Ad-seg 3-4-6-1-7.

02:03.523 --> 02:04.329
Yeah.

02:06.312 --> 02:07.641
What do you mean?

02:09.834 --> 02:12.392
Lockwood's no longer in
administrative segregation.

02:13.768 --> 02:16.282
Where is he?
He was transferred to general population

02:16.283 --> 02:18.330
about an hour ago.
What?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.823
He was in ad-seg for a reason.

02:21.824 --> 02:24.972
You gotta get him outta there. Now.
Why? What's the big deal?

02:24.973 --> 02:27.901
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

02:28.558 --> 02:29.571
There is a prisoner

02:29.572 --> 02:31.816
in the general population--
Gary McCallister.

02:31.817 --> 02:34.912
Lockwood is going to kill him
the first chance he gets.

02:35.125 --> 02:36.655
Lockwood! Lockwood!

02:37.783 --> 02:40.808
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

02:44.974 --> 02:47.646
You know, I was wondering when
he was gonna get around to me.

02:48.026 --> 02:49.911
It's okay if you want a minute.

02:51.699 --> 02:53.549
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

03:08.050 --> 03:10.023
Don't make a mess of it, okay?

03:12.028 --> 03:13.591
I never do.

03:37.237 --> 03:38.382
Go.

03:48.213 --> 03:50.738
How did he even get into
the general population?

03:50.919 --> 03:52.131
Esposito's running it down now,

03:52.132 --> 03:53.995
but I'm guessing it wasn't an accident.

03:55.766 --> 03:56.692
I'm sorry.

03:57.378 --> 03:58.401
For what?

03:59.925 --> 04:03.346
Well, Lockwood kills Raglan,
then he shanks McCallister,

04:03.347 --> 04:04.426
both of them ex-cops

04:04.427 --> 04:05.841
who had something to do
with your mother's murder.

04:05.842 --> 04:07.669
He's cutting off all avenues
of your investigation.

04:07.670 --> 04:10.491
Castle, he's not cutting them off.
He's giving me new ones.

04:11.324 --> 04:12.723
I've been going to that prison

04:12.724 --> 04:14.516
every week for the last four months

04:14.517 --> 04:16.293
to have a staring contest with the devil,

04:16.295 --> 04:17.805
and the devil just blinked.

04:18.774 --> 04:20.714
This is exactly what I've been looking for.

04:22.501 --> 04:24.343
Hey, Department of Corrections

04:24.344 --> 04:26.641
says the signature used on the
transfer order was forged.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.804
And the only people with access
to those documents at the prison

04:28.805 --> 04:29.964
are correctional officers and

04:29.965 --> 04:33.004
authorized clerical staff.
Which means bribe or blackmail.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.386
I want a full financial
workup of every employee

04:35.387 --> 04:37.116
in that prison, sworn and civilian.

04:37.117 --> 04:38.928
I want to know who was
late on their mortgage,

04:38.929 --> 04:40.941
who was behind on their child support.

04:40.942 --> 04:43.839
Somebody took a hell of a risk
cutting Lockwood this transfer,

04:43.840 --> 04:45.918
and they had to have been pretty desperate.
You got it.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.920
See? Now we got a trail.
So where are we going?

04:48.921 --> 04:50.438
To Lockwood's arraignment.

04:50.439 --> 04:52.347
I want to see if we can rattle his cage.

04:52.348 --> 04:54.150
Lockwood doesn't seem
like the rattling type.

04:54.151 --> 04:57.202
Not Lockwood. Whoever's holding his leash.

05:04.355 --> 05:06.387
First Raglan and now McCallister.

05:06.388 --> 05:08.813
What are you doing,
collecting the whole set?

05:09.394 --> 05:10.882
You're a real badass, Lockwood,

05:10.883 --> 05:12.710
shanking an old man in his bunk.

05:12.711 --> 05:14.844
I don't know what you
think you accomplished,

05:14.845 --> 05:16.792
but this doesn't change a thing.

05:17.340 --> 05:18.471
You hear me?

05:18.888 --> 05:21.243
Whoever hired you...

05:21.570 --> 05:23.555
He can't hide from me.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.839
No, sweetheart.

05:26.338 --> 05:28.440
You got it ass backwards.

05:29.164 --> 05:31.203
You can't hide from him.

05:32.271 --> 05:33.388
Please take your seat, ma'am.

05:36.846 --> 05:38.129
All rise.

05:39.197 --> 05:40.568
The court's in session.

05:42.923 --> 05:44.289
Be seated.

05:46.936 --> 05:48.677
Matter number 27 on the list--

05:48.678 --> 05:50.183
The people of the state of New York

05:50.184 --> 05:53.337
vs. John Doe, A.K.A. Harold Lockwood.

05:53.451 --> 05:54.799
The matter is on for arraignment.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.782
Counsel, for the record and
who you represent, please.

05:57.934 --> 06:00.878
Avery Zussman for Harold
Lockwood, your honor.

06:01.654 --> 06:02.295
On the matter of

06:02.296 --> 06:04.488
the people of the state of New York...
What is it?

06:04.489 --> 06:07.295
Indictment number 2-0-1-1-4-6-0,

06:07.296 --> 06:10.030
the charge is premeditated murder...
I don't know.

06:10.031 --> 06:11.821
With a special circumstances allegation.

06:11.822 --> 06:13.927
Mr. Lockwood, do you waive a formal reading

06:13.928 --> 06:16.227
of this indictment?
I do.

06:17.355 --> 06:19.232
They're wearing chrome collar pins.

06:20.732 --> 06:22.570
NYPD's are brass.

06:22.571 --> 06:23.981
And how do you plead?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.754
Now.

06:27.416 --> 06:29.295
Castle, down!

06:45.946 --> 06:46.998
Are you okay?!

06:46.999 --> 06:48.675
Yeah, yeah.

06:54.764 --> 06:55.705
Where? Where?

06:55.706 --> 06:56.541
Downstairs.

07:00.735 --> 07:02.834
Come on. Keep moving.
Come on. Let's go. Go.

07:39.812 --> 07:40.933
How's she doing?

07:40.934 --> 07:43.304
Lockwood's in the wind.
Everything about her mom's case

07:43.305 --> 07:45.427
just went to hell in a handbasket.
How ya think?

07:49.006 --> 07:50.946
Where are we on Lockwood's
known associates?

07:50.947 --> 07:52.564
Courthouse security personnel were so used

07:52.565 --> 07:54.720
to seeing cops come and go,
nobody gave 'em a second look.

07:54.721 --> 07:56.401
He didn't care about anybody
seeing their faces.

07:56.402 --> 07:58.322
Did FBI run 'em through facial recognition?

07:58.323 --> 08:00.868
No hits. Guys are ghosts.
What about the chopper?

08:00.869 --> 08:03.420
F.A.A. says that they flew below
the 1,000-foot radar ceiling.

08:03.421 --> 08:05.880
They had to know NYPD would have
helicopters searching for 'em,

08:05.881 --> 08:06.813
so they'd want to ditch their chopper

08:06.814 --> 08:08.503
as soon as they could.
We got locals on the ground

08:08.504 --> 08:11.028
checking every small airfield
in the Tristate area.

08:11.029 --> 08:13.639
I got nothing so far.
Hey, Beckett. We got something.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.791
Check your in-box.

08:18.512 --> 08:20.681
So phone calls from the
prison are recorded,

08:20.682 --> 08:22.630
and every inmate has to make collect calls.

08:22.631 --> 08:26.370
Apparently, Lockwood made weekly
calls to the same number,

08:26.371 --> 08:28.373
but week after week, the
person at the end of the call

08:28.374 --> 08:30.400
refused to accept the charges,

08:30.401 --> 08:31.793
until four days ago.

08:31.794 --> 08:32.909
Okay, here it is.

08:32.909 --> 08:36.611
How's the family? Same.
How are Charlie and Mike?

08:36.613 --> 08:37.884
Good.

08:38.311 --> 08:41.018
Anything on the phone number?
Burner cell, untraceable.

08:41.019 --> 08:42.456
All right, check known
associates named Charlie

08:42.457 --> 08:44.087
or Mike.
They're not talking about people.

08:44.089 --> 08:46.290
That's the phonetic
alphabet, military jargon.

08:46.291 --> 08:49.268
"Charlie and Mike" means continue mission.

08:50.552 --> 08:53.126
Well, we know the mission
wasn't McCallister.

08:53.127 --> 08:55.666
He was just a means to escape.
They could've paid off anyone

08:55.667 --> 08:57.760
in the general population
to kill McCallister, but it

08:57.761 --> 08:59.669
had to be Lockwood because
they needed to get him out.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.828
Which means Lockwood was after somebody else.
Who's left?

09:03.795 --> 09:06.619
Me.
Lockwood could've killed you in the courtroom.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.512
You're not a threat.
You don't know anything.

09:08.690 --> 09:10.662
I think I know who he's after.

09:11.096 --> 09:13.109
We know that your mom was killed

09:13.110 --> 09:14.844
because she was working to free a mobster

09:14.845 --> 09:16.629
who was wrongfully convicted of the murder

09:16.630 --> 09:18.893
of an undercover federal
officer--Bob Armen.

09:18.894 --> 09:21.305
We know that the real
killers were renegade cops

09:21.306 --> 09:23.132
who were practicing their
own form of street justice

09:23.133 --> 09:25.983
by kidnapping mobsters for ransom.

09:25.984 --> 09:28.677
These guys were also working for somebody--

09:28.678 --> 09:31.371
Somebody big, somebody
who will stop at nothing

09:31.372 --> 09:33.023
to keep his identity a secret.

09:33.974 --> 09:34.856
Which means there's still

09:34.857 --> 09:37.160
one loose thread out there.
The third cop.

09:37.398 --> 09:40.514
The man that Joe Pulgatti saw
in the alley with John Raglan

09:40.515 --> 09:42.856
and Gary McCallister the night
that Bob Armen was killed.

09:42.857 --> 09:44.800
Whoever this guy is, if he's still around,

09:44.801 --> 09:46.742
he knows who's behind this whole thing.

09:46.743 --> 09:48.555
Which makes him Lockwood's next target.

09:48.599 --> 09:49.980
But we looked through the reports.

09:49.981 --> 09:51.584
There's no mention of any third cop.

09:51.585 --> 09:52.959
Just because he's not mentioned in it

09:52.960 --> 09:54.981
doesn't mean he wasn't there.
Excuse me.

09:55.461 --> 09:59.039
Beckett. Put a detail on her.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.644
She's not gonna like that.
You don't have to tell her.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.862
If Lockwood's going after this
third cop, he's still in town.

10:04.863 --> 10:06.934
You both know what he's capable of.

10:07.108 --> 10:09.805
If you get a chance to put
him down, do not hesitate.

10:09.806 --> 10:10.985
That son of a bitch doesn't need

10:10.986 --> 10:12.921
to see the inside of another courtroom.

10:13.222 --> 10:15.540
You read me?
Loud and clear.

10:15.541 --> 10:17.446
That was the Jersey State Police.

10:17.447 --> 10:18.937
They found the chopper.

10:23.704 --> 10:25.000
Yours?

10:25.001 --> 10:26.111
Yeah.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.466
That smell-- is that, uh--

10:28.467 --> 10:30.350
Bleach in the cabin.
They were destroying D.N.A.

10:30.351 --> 10:31.720
Evidence.
Mechanic says

10:31.721 --> 10:33.401
the chopper must have
been stolen and returned

10:33.402 --> 10:34.728
before anyone knew it was missing.

10:34.729 --> 10:36.604
He says he wouldn't even have
known anybody had used it

10:36.605 --> 10:38.187
if it weren't for the bullet holes.

10:38.188 --> 10:39.511
Who does the helicopter belong to?

10:39.512 --> 10:41.489
Hedge fund manager from Upstate.
Where is he now?

10:41.490 --> 10:43.193
Sailing in the Caribbean with his family.

10:43.194 --> 10:45.275
All right, check his
background and the mechanic's,

10:45.276 --> 10:47.357
and anybody else who works here.
Right.

10:49.598 --> 10:50.888
Why now?

10:51.944 --> 10:53.301
Lockwood was in prison for months.

10:53.302 --> 10:56.940
Why would he make a move now?
Well, they had him transferred,

10:57.257 --> 10:58.583
and then they broke him out of a courtroom.

10:58.584 --> 11:01.085
That takes time, planning, resources.

11:01.086 --> 11:02.978
What if it was something else?

11:04.026 --> 11:05.818
What if there's another reason?

11:05.973 --> 11:07.151
Like what?

11:10.865 --> 11:12.141
You know, um...

11:12.690 --> 11:15.519
I think I saw a surveillance
camera outside the building.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.531
We pull the surveillance,

11:17.532 --> 11:19.804
look for a vehicle, maybe get an A.P.B.

11:19.805 --> 11:20.883
You okay?

11:24.030 --> 11:25.121
Yeah.

11:34.592 --> 11:35.579
Beckett's mom?

11:35.580 --> 11:36.370
Yeah.

11:37.436 --> 11:39.649
I can't imagine what it
must be like for her--

11:40.043 --> 11:42.428
Solving murders
and bringing closure to all those families,

11:42.429 --> 11:44.593
but never to herself.

11:45.133 --> 11:46.724
It's easier in my books.

11:46.986 --> 11:50.404
The just are rewarded,
the wicked are punished.

11:50.672 --> 11:53.539
Unfortunately, real life isn't that easy.

11:59.816 --> 12:00.854
Can I help you?

12:00.855 --> 12:03.895
I hope so. I'm Jim Beckett, Kate's father.

12:06.002 --> 12:07.529
I feel like I already know you, Rick.

12:07.530 --> 12:09.440
I've heard a lot of great things about you

12:09.441 --> 12:11.473
from Katie.
Really?

12:12.090 --> 12:13.135
Really.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.506
So... how's she holding up?

12:17.078 --> 12:18.876
Well, it's kind of tough to
tell with her, you know?

12:18.877 --> 12:20.104
She doesn't flinch.

12:20.277 --> 12:22.948
I know. She wouldn't accept a night-light

12:22.949 --> 12:24.333
when she was a little girl.

12:24.531 --> 12:25.644
Not that she wasn't afraid of the dark,

12:25.645 --> 12:28.073
but I think she just felt
it was a point of pride to,

12:28.372 --> 12:29.473
you know, stare it down.

12:35.314 --> 12:38.459
This... man she's chasing.

12:40.189 --> 12:41.906
How dangerous is he?

12:43.379 --> 12:44.869
He's a trained killer.

12:49.342 --> 12:50.944
What happens when she finds him?

12:53.459 --> 12:55.932
I've already lost my wife over this.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.660
I've already lost...

13:02.896 --> 13:04.791
Now look, i... it took me years,

13:04.792 --> 13:06.283
but I've made my peace with that.

13:06.447 --> 13:07.512
But Katie?

13:08.176 --> 13:10.859
She won't listen to me
and she won't back down.

13:10.903 --> 13:12.156
Not unless someone can convince her

13:12.157 --> 13:14.948
that her life is worth more
than her mother's death.

13:19.126 --> 13:20.787
Look, she cares about you, Rick.

13:22.063 --> 13:23.752
And unless you're a lot
dumber than you look,

13:23.753 --> 13:25.301
I know you care about her.

13:27.338 --> 13:29.650
Don't let her throw her life away.

13:39.780 --> 13:41.016
How'd you sleep?

13:41.519 --> 13:43.705
I didn't.
Yeah. Me neither.

13:43.951 --> 13:45.027
Thank you.
Listen, I was wondering--

13:45.028 --> 13:47.063
So we ran financials on everyone
associated with the prison--

13:47.064 --> 13:48.551
guards, civilian employees,

13:48.552 --> 13:50.241
medical staff.
Found a guard named Ryker.

13:50.242 --> 13:52.746
He's underwater in his mortgage,
he maxed out his credit cards,

13:52.747 --> 13:56.049
and he was about to lose his condo.
Ryker? I know Ryker.

13:56.050 --> 13:58.490
You only thought you knew Ryker.
The day before Lockwood

13:58.491 --> 13:59.979
was transferred to general population,

13:59.980 --> 14:02.910
Ryker received a $50,000 wire transfer.

14:02.911 --> 14:05.458
And guess who didn't
show up for work today.

14:08.633 --> 14:10.185
NYPD! NYPD!

14:10.186 --> 14:13.446
NYPD! Do not move!
Show us your hands, Ryker!

14:13.447 --> 14:14.415
Let's go! Let me see your hands!

14:14.416 --> 14:15.651
Let's see those hands!

14:17.559 --> 14:18.469
Go.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.758
The bullet entered through
the back of the head,

14:33.759 --> 14:36.147
exited through the front,
and landed in the cabinet.

14:36.148 --> 14:37.200
I'm making the time of death

14:37.201 --> 14:40.748
around 9:00 last night.
Ryker made four phone calls

14:40.749 --> 14:42.960
to the same burner cell that
Lockwood called from prison.

14:42.961 --> 14:44.815
He was negotiating prices.

14:45.948 --> 14:48.743
Ryker had no idea who he was dealing with.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.178
That was the D.O.J.

14:50.385 --> 14:52.049
The $50,000 wire transfer

14:52.050 --> 14:53.720
bounced through the United Arab Emirates

14:53.721 --> 14:55.323
before it ended up in Ryker's account.

14:55.324 --> 14:57.410
It came from the Dubai
branch of a Swiss Bank.

14:57.411 --> 15:00.203
Who the hell are these guys?
Well, whoever they are,

15:00.275 --> 15:02.793
they've been two steps ahead
of us this whole time.

15:02.794 --> 15:04.907
You don't go through this kind
of trouble to cover up a couple

15:04.908 --> 15:07.976
of rogue cops kidnapping
mobsters in some back alley.

15:07.977 --> 15:10.570
No, this is about something
else, something bigger.

15:10.571 --> 15:11.843
If we want to catch these sons of bitches,

15:11.844 --> 15:13.753
we're gonna have to bring
the fight to them.

15:14.177 --> 15:15.561
Notify Ryker's next of kin.

15:15.562 --> 15:17.102
Let's talk to his neighbors again,

15:17.103 --> 15:19.102
anybody else that knew him at the prison.

15:19.522 --> 15:22.054
I want to see if he made
any new friends lately.

15:22.569 --> 15:24.727
How long did you know
Ryker, officer Haskell?

15:24.728 --> 15:26.858
Since he came to the prison-- almost, uh,

15:27.661 --> 15:28.955
almost ten years, I guess.

15:28.956 --> 15:31.153
Was he having trouble with
anyone at the prison?

15:31.369 --> 15:34.045
Ryker was stainless.
All the other corrections officers

15:34.046 --> 15:36.389
liked him, and even the
worst cons respected him,

15:36.390 --> 15:38.533
'cause Ryker treated them with respect.

15:38.534 --> 15:41.681
Was there anyone new in his
life, maybe a girlfriend?

15:41.682 --> 15:43.398
Uh, no one.

15:44.524 --> 15:46.988
In fact, he'd been working
up the nerve for weeks

15:46.989 --> 15:48.848
to ask you out, Detective.

15:50.390 --> 15:53.070
Uh, did you know, uh, Ryker was
having financial problems?

15:53.389 --> 15:55.521
No. He never said a word to me.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.768
And I was probably closer
to him than anyone.

15:58.138 --> 16:00.111
We're getting the same thing
from everyone we talk to.

16:00.112 --> 16:01.648
Ryker was a stand-up guy.

16:01.649 --> 16:03.631
None of his friends even knew
he had financial trouble.

16:03.632 --> 16:05.464
And other than calls to that burner phone,

16:05.465 --> 16:06.539
there's nothing in his phone records

16:06.540 --> 16:08.299
to indicate any new contacts in his life.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.602
We just got word on the security
footage from the airport.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.822
Cameras did pick up a
blue late-model Malibu

16:12.823 --> 16:15.869
leaving the area, but its
license plate was blacked out.

16:16.324 --> 16:18.748
So basically, we've got
nothing still, right?

16:18.749 --> 16:20.114
Just a bunch of dead ends.

16:20.115 --> 16:23.368
Everywhere I look, it's
just a bunch of dead ends.

16:23.532 --> 16:26.368
You know, whoever planned
this escape for Lockwood

16:26.533 --> 16:28.493
knew they would need someone on the inside.

16:29.066 --> 16:30.513
If Ryker was such a straight arrow,

16:30.514 --> 16:31.808
why would they approach him?

16:31.809 --> 16:33.849
He was a soft target because
of his financial troubles.

16:33.850 --> 16:35.242
How would they know that?

16:35.646 --> 16:37.943
They found him the same way we did--
financial records.

16:37.944 --> 16:40.409
They ran financials on
everybody in that prison.

16:40.410 --> 16:41.548
Who would have that kind of authority?

16:41.549 --> 16:44.989
A cop or someone who was a cop.

16:44.990 --> 16:47.905
So this third cop wasn't Lockwood's target.

16:47.906 --> 16:50.635
This third cop was the one who
was holding Lockwood's leash.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.706
He's the one who's behind this whole thing.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.846
Okay, I want us to pull reports

16:54.847 --> 16:56.717
with Raglan and McCallister's name on it.

16:56.718 --> 16:57.718
We did all that already.

16:57.719 --> 16:58.730
Months ago. There's nothing.

16:58.731 --> 17:00.142
No, no, no, I'm not talking
about arrest reports.

17:00.143 --> 17:01.234
I'm talking about performance

17:01.235 --> 17:03.360
evaluations--
We went through everything.

17:03.361 --> 17:04.959
We looked at every cop we could find

17:04.960 --> 17:06.108
who could've worked with them.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.323
None of 'em are our third guy.
Well, then check it again.

17:08.324 --> 17:10.799
And when you're done with
that, check it again.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.769
Beckett, we want him as bad as you.

17:12.770 --> 17:16.672
The hell you do.
Nobody wants him as bad as I do, okay?

17:16.673 --> 17:19.565
Nobody. So check it again.

17:22.044 --> 17:23.028
Find anything?

17:23.029 --> 17:24.652
Hell, I bet there wasn't even a third cop.

17:24.653 --> 17:28.313
I mean, seriously, Dubai,
paramilitary extraction--

17:28.314 --> 17:31.512
How does a cop even begin to
mount an operation like this?

17:31.513 --> 17:33.967
These guys were kidnapping
mobsters for months,

17:33.968 --> 17:36.901
maybe even years before
things went sideways.

17:36.902 --> 17:38.625
They could've made millions in ransom.

17:38.626 --> 17:40.746
That would mean this third cop
would have plenty of cash

17:40.747 --> 17:43.247
to hire professionals like
Dick Coonan and Hal Lockwood

17:43.248 --> 17:44.498
to clean up his mess.

17:45.926 --> 17:47.156
Keep checking.

17:49.620 --> 17:50.440
Sir.

17:50.732 --> 17:53.307
Uh... I know we're still
officially on duty, but--

17:53.308 --> 17:54.071
Authorized.

17:54.072 --> 17:54.901
It's lunch.

17:56.751 --> 17:58.060
Nice work.

17:58.061 --> 17:59.785
Ooh, those are cold. Yeah.

17:59.786 --> 18:01.108
Those are really cold.

18:01.109 --> 18:03.494
Yeah, we keep 'em in evidence--
refrigerated storage.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.962
Isn't that where you keep the--
Don't worry about it.

18:09.907 --> 18:11.177
How is she?

18:11.178 --> 18:13.155
She hasn't returned my calls.

18:13.156 --> 18:14.113
She just grabbed those case

18:14.114 --> 18:17.217
files and ran outta here.
She's getting lost.

18:17.218 --> 18:18.954
She's an inch away from the rabbit hole.

18:18.955 --> 18:21.557
She'll be fine. She always is.

18:21.995 --> 18:23.475
What if we come up empty?

18:24.853 --> 18:26.302
Who's Napolitano?

18:26.303 --> 18:27.916
Oh, he worked with Raglan on a
couple of drug busts,

18:27.917 --> 18:29.036
but he was at his daughter's wedding

18:29.037 --> 18:30.418
the night Bob Armen was shot,

18:30.419 --> 18:32.907
so he's not our third cop.
Where is he now?

18:32.908 --> 18:35.170
He died of heart failure back in 1993.

18:35.171 --> 18:37.993
Why are you asking about Napolitano?
Uh, he and Raglan are listed

18:37.994 --> 18:40.068
as the arresting officers on this report,

18:40.069 --> 18:42.539
but this has been altered.

18:42.540 --> 18:44.495
What? How can you tell?

18:44.496 --> 18:46.180
Because I know typewriters.

18:48.018 --> 18:50.566
Older typewriters use cloth ribbon.

18:50.567 --> 18:53.171
If you look closely, you can see
the striations in the typeface.

18:53.172 --> 18:56.216
Newer typewriters used film ribbon.

18:56.217 --> 18:58.042
Somebody whited out...

18:58.043 --> 19:00.299
The assisting officer's
name on this report,

19:01.213 --> 19:03.641
photocopied it, and then
typed in Napolitano's name.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.577
It's a cover-up, literally.

19:05.578 --> 19:08.043
I'll be damned.
What are you doing?

19:08.044 --> 19:10.583
Well, documents have a way of
disappearing in this case.

19:10.584 --> 19:15.358
This way, we all have it.
Let's show cap.

19:15.972 --> 19:16.997
Son of a bitch went through

19:16.998 --> 19:18.778
a lot of trouble to cover his tracks.

19:18.779 --> 19:19.953
We found two other reports where

19:19.954 --> 19:22.569
Napolitano's name was added on.
We figure whoever did them

19:22.570 --> 19:24.133
had to have done so after Armen's murder.

19:24.134 --> 19:25.513
But before we went digital.

19:25.514 --> 19:26.954
That's over ten years.
You're talking about

19:26.955 --> 19:27.820
thousands of officers walking in

19:27.821 --> 19:29.685
and out of the records room.
Yeah, but whoever took

19:29.686 --> 19:31.448
their name off those
reports would've had to go

19:31.449 --> 19:33.467
physically get them from the records room.

19:33.468 --> 19:34.289
Find out who was Manning

19:34.290 --> 19:35.479
the records desk during that time.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.312
- Maybe that someone remembers
looking the other way. - Right.

19:40.711 --> 19:41.877
What?

19:42.762 --> 19:44.093
Continue mission?

19:45.188 --> 19:47.054
If Lockwood isn't going
after the third cop,

19:47.055 --> 19:48.653
then who's the mission?

19:48.654 --> 19:50.773
I put a protective detail
on her--plainclothes.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.412
These guys are good.
Good enough to stop Lockwood?

19:54.623 --> 19:57.793
Look, she's not gonna stop, and
the next time he sees her,

19:57.794 --> 19:59.789
one of them is gonna die.

19:59.790 --> 20:01.448
Take her off the case.

20:01.928 --> 20:03.926
Castle, did Beckett ever
tell you how we met?

20:05.549 --> 20:06.262
No.

20:06.370 --> 20:09.348
I was working late one night
and went down to archives

20:09.349 --> 20:11.643
to locate some old reports.

20:12.057 --> 20:14.349
And there she was, with a flashlight

20:14.548 --> 20:16.593
and a bankers box open on her lap,

20:16.843 --> 20:18.745
studying this unsolved.

20:18.996 --> 20:20.020
She was a patrol cop then.

20:20.021 --> 20:22.042
She wasn't even authorized
to be down there.

20:22.043 --> 20:23.278
When I asked her what
the hell she was doing,

20:23.279 --> 20:25.289
she told me, this was her mother's case

20:25.513 --> 20:27.496
and she'd found some
things that didn't add up.

20:27.842 --> 20:30.508
Now I could've written her up right then.
Why didn't you?

20:30.509 --> 20:32.183
Because I knew it wouldn't stop her.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.979
It was there in her eyes,
man, and I thought...

20:35.466 --> 20:37.776
With this kid's tenacity and some training,

20:37.777 --> 20:39.633
I mean, she'd make a hell of a homicide.

20:39.987 --> 20:42.049
That tenacity is gonna get her killed.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.705
I cannot...

20:44.363 --> 20:47.277
Make Beckett stand down, Castle.

20:47.452 --> 20:48.907
I never could,

20:48.908 --> 20:51.204
and the way I figure,
the only one who can...

20:52.026 --> 20:53.412
is you.

21:02.444 --> 21:03.516
Can I come in?

21:03.811 --> 21:04.572
Yeah.

21:05.535 --> 21:06.523
So we went over

21:06.524 --> 21:09.740
all of Raglan and McCallister's
old arrest records,

21:09.741 --> 21:10.987
and you were right.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.599
There was a third cop that was with them

21:12.600 --> 21:13.485
on a lot of those arrests.

21:13.486 --> 21:15.368
But then someone went
back into those reports

21:15.369 --> 21:18.272
and removed their name, so Ryan
and Esposito are right now

21:18.273 --> 21:20.182
looking into who was running
the records room back then.

21:20.183 --> 21:21.428
Castle, you couldn't have just called me

21:21.429 --> 21:22.963
and told me this over the phone?

21:23.172 --> 21:25.978
Well, yeah, I... I thought that...

21:27.658 --> 21:30.044
Castle, if you got something
to say, just please say it.

21:32.845 --> 21:36.428
Beckett, everyone associated
with this case is dead.

21:37.070 --> 21:38.380
Everyone.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.290
First your mom and her colleagues,

21:40.291 --> 21:41.638
then Raglan, then McCallister.

21:41.639 --> 21:43.688
You know they're coming for you next.

21:44.697 --> 21:47.319
Captain Montgomery's got a
protective detail on me.

21:47.611 --> 21:48.776
It wasn't that hard to spot.

21:48.777 --> 21:50.972
That's not gonna be enough
to stop Lockwood. You know that.

21:50.973 --> 21:52.266
Think about what they're up against--

21:52.267 --> 21:53.744
Professional killers?

21:54.430 --> 21:57.536
I-I've been working with you
for three years. You know me.

21:57.537 --> 21:59.578
I am the guy who says we can
move that rubber tree plant.

21:59.579 --> 22:00.350
But you know what, Beckett?

22:00.351 --> 22:01.503
I don't think we're gonna win this.

22:01.504 --> 22:05.223
Castle, they killed my mother.
What do you want me to do here?

22:06.165 --> 22:07.304
Walk away.

22:10.005 --> 22:11.814
They're gonna kill you, Kate.

22:13.064 --> 22:14.710
And if you don't care about that...

22:15.825 --> 22:17.409
At least think about how
that's gonna affect

22:17.410 --> 22:19.202
the people that love you.

22:19.586 --> 22:21.909
You really want to put
your dad through that?

22:21.910 --> 22:24.329
And what about Josh?
And what about you, Rick?

22:24.330 --> 22:26.167
Well, of course I don't want
anything to happen to you.

22:26.168 --> 22:29.431
I'm your partner. I'm your friend.
Is that what we are?

22:31.526 --> 22:34.329
Oh, you know what?
I don't know what we are.

22:34.529 --> 22:36.412
We kiss and then we never talk about it.

22:36.413 --> 22:38.866
We nearly die frozen in each other's arms,

22:38.867 --> 22:40.123
but we never talk about it,

22:40.124 --> 22:42.505
so no, I got no clue what we are.

22:42.506 --> 22:44.331
I know I don't want to see
you throw your life away.

22:44.332 --> 22:46.901
Yeah, well, last time I
checked, it was my life,

22:46.902 --> 22:49.353
not your personal jungle gym.

22:49.642 --> 22:51.234
And for the past three years,

22:51.235 --> 22:54.736
I have been running around with
the school's funniest kid.

22:54.737 --> 22:56.165
And it's not funny enough.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.979
You know what? This isn't about
your mother's case anymore.

22:57.980 --> 23:00.214
This is about you needing a place to hide,

23:00.820 --> 23:02.221
because you've been chasing
this thing so long,

23:02.222 --> 23:03.317
you're afraid to find out who

23:03.318 --> 23:06.296
you are without it.
You don't know me, Castle.

23:06.780 --> 23:08.808
You think you do, but you don't.

23:08.809 --> 23:11.112
I know you crawled inside
your mother's murder

23:11.113 --> 23:12.459
and didn't come out.

23:12.804 --> 23:14.163
I know you hide there

23:14.164 --> 23:15.924
the same way you hide in
these nowhere relationships

23:15.925 --> 23:17.987
with men you don't love.

23:18.743 --> 23:20.796
You could be happy, Kate.

23:21.694 --> 23:23.575
You deserve to be happy.

23:24.436 --> 23:25.946
But you're afraid.

23:29.258 --> 23:30.306
You know what we are, Castle?

23:30.307 --> 23:31.824
We are over.

23:32.155 --> 23:33.578
Now get out.

23:55.845 --> 23:58.910
Oh, my God! What the hell's going on here?

23:58.911 --> 24:01.283
Nothing. I'm sorry. Go back to bed.

24:02.092 --> 24:03.212
There's only one person on the planet

24:03.213 --> 24:05.168
that can get you this pissed off.

24:07.036 --> 24:08.961
She's going to get herself killed.

24:08.962 --> 24:10.134
She's a grown woman.

24:10.135 --> 24:13.000
She's a homicide detective, for God sakes.

24:13.001 --> 24:14.632
It's her job. It's her life.

24:14.633 --> 24:17.468
If anything happens to her...

24:19.966 --> 24:21.230
Go on.

24:22.734 --> 24:25.061
Oh, Richard, Richard.

24:25.062 --> 24:26.578
For a man who makes his living with words,

24:26.579 --> 24:29.854
you sure have a hell of a time
finding them when it counts.

24:30.279 --> 24:31.372
Darling...

24:31.945 --> 24:34.241
Let me give you a word
of advice, all right,

24:34.343 --> 24:37.075
from someone who's better than
halfway through the movie.

24:37.486 --> 24:41.286
Don't waste another minute of it.

24:41.936 --> 24:45.749
Roy, I am over it. I mean it.
I want him gone.

24:46.277 --> 24:47.478
Okay. He's gone.

24:48.195 --> 24:48.946
What?

24:49.143 --> 24:50.982
You want Castle gone?
He's gone.

24:51.439 --> 24:54.392
W--I--what-- what about the Mayor?

24:54.393 --> 24:55.597
This is my house, Kate.

24:55.598 --> 24:57.688
The Mayor doesn't call
the shots here. I do.

24:57.884 --> 24:59.340
You ought to know that by now.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.250
But I-I th-- I could've kicked
Castle to the curb years ago--

25:03.251 --> 25:04.904
Anytime I wanted to.

25:05.512 --> 25:07.325
Only reason I kept him around this long

25:07.326 --> 25:09.139
was because I saw how good he was for you.

25:12.879 --> 25:13.810
Kate...

25:14.832 --> 25:16.292
You're the best that I've ever trained,

25:16.293 --> 25:17.917
maybe the best I've ever seen.

25:18.332 --> 25:20.742
But you weren't having any
fun before he came along.

25:26.634 --> 25:28.247
We speak for the dead.

25:29.557 --> 25:30.848
That's the job.

25:31.513 --> 25:32.738
We are all they've got

25:32.739 --> 25:35.439
once the wicked rob them of their voices.

25:36.199 --> 25:37.819
We owe them that.

25:39.131 --> 25:41.104
But we don't owe 'em our lives.

25:45.359 --> 25:47.124
He said that we can't win this.

25:47.125 --> 25:48.517
He's right.

25:49.487 --> 25:52.120
I've spent most of my life
walking behind this badge,

25:52.121 --> 25:53.885
and I can tell you this for a fact--

25:54.476 --> 25:56.122
There are no victories.

25:56.998 --> 25:58.482
There's only the battle.

25:58.483 --> 25:59.808
And the best that you could hope for

25:59.809 --> 26:03.966
is that you find someplace
where you can make your stand.

26:04.332 --> 26:05.774
If this is your spot...

26:08.333 --> 26:10.246
I will stand with you.

26:13.710 --> 26:15.612
I really don't think a
badge is behind all this.

26:15.918 --> 26:18.017
No one on the job has this kind of juice.

26:18.018 --> 26:19.641
If he worked with McCallister and Raglan,

26:19.642 --> 26:21.756
he's probably long retired by now.

26:21.939 --> 26:24.384
I mean, he could be in private
security, politics, business.

26:24.385 --> 26:26.624
Man, I can't believe I
gotta call these guys.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.230
You know how pension guys love to talk.

26:28.231 --> 26:29.623
I bet I'm gonna be on the phone for hours

26:29.624 --> 26:32.978
listening to stories about the glory days.
Hey, listen to this--

26:33.121 --> 26:34.398
Mike Yanavich, sergeant,

26:34.399 --> 26:37.172
assigned to the records
room from '02 to '05.

26:37.173 --> 26:39.209
It says he ran it right
up until he retired,

26:39.210 --> 26:41.714
and Yanavich graduated from the academy

26:41.715 --> 26:43.609
in the same class as Gary McCallister

26:43.610 --> 26:47.071
and John Raglan.
Well, maybe he's our third cop. Where is he?

26:49.150 --> 26:51.658
Looks like Yanavich relocated to
Miami Beach after he retired.

26:51.659 --> 26:53.074
Contact Miami-Dade P.D. in the morning.

26:53.075 --> 26:54.941
See if they can verify his address.

26:55.149 --> 26:57.313
We'll fly down to Miami
to get him if we have to.

27:07.298 --> 27:09.247
Hello, Roy.

27:11.785 --> 27:13.486
You're not that fast.

27:13.806 --> 27:15.877
Besides, they're all upstairs asleep,

27:15.878 --> 27:17.169
safe and sound.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.045
And they're not on tonight's menu.

27:20.696 --> 27:24.186
But if you wake 'em up, well,
then I gotta order off the menu.

27:24.389 --> 27:25.681
What do you want?

27:26.467 --> 27:28.537
He's very disappointed, Roy.

27:28.738 --> 27:29.856
We all are.

27:30.124 --> 27:32.345
I mean, d-did you not understand

27:32.346 --> 27:34.488
the conditions of the agreement?

27:35.078 --> 27:37.827
Beckett stays alive as long
as you keep her on a leash.

27:37.828 --> 27:40.165
That's the deal that you made with him.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.546
But you're not holding up your end.

27:42.745 --> 27:43.636
And that's unfortunate,

27:43.637 --> 27:45.687
because she really is a lovely girl.

27:47.403 --> 27:50.161
But now we've reached a... critical stage,

27:50.162 --> 27:53.004
and I have to cap the well.

27:53.966 --> 27:55.955
So here's the news--

27:56.344 --> 27:59.267
Tomorrow night, you're gonna
call off that protective detail

27:59.268 --> 28:00.723
that you have on her,

28:00.724 --> 28:01.690
and then you're gonna get her

28:01.691 --> 28:04.213
to meet you at the hangar
where we stashed the bird.

28:04.214 --> 28:07.650
I don't care how you do it,
just get her there,

28:07.651 --> 28:11.036
and we'll handle the rest.
Go to hell.

28:14.627 --> 28:16.683
Well, then you have a decision to make.

28:17.355 --> 28:18.893
You can have Beckett...

28:19.374 --> 28:21.482
Or you can have your family.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.905
But you can't have both.

28:25.599 --> 28:26.886
Look at it this way--

28:26.887 --> 28:28.742
If you and Raglan and McCallister

28:28.743 --> 28:31.504
hadn't sinned so spectacularly,

28:31.900 --> 28:35.882
then God wouldn't have
sent a punishment like me.

28:40.394 --> 28:42.287
We're gonna be late.
Come on.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.384
Where are my girls?

28:46.056 --> 28:47.370
Come and give your old man a kiss.

28:47.371 --> 28:48.826
Mwah. Look at you.

28:49.204 --> 28:51.514
Hey, get off that phone and give me a kiss.

28:54.510 --> 28:56.547
You know, I'm so proud of both of you.

28:56.548 --> 28:57.256
Dad.

28:57.257 --> 28:59.095
Come on. In the car, you two.

28:59.096 --> 29:00.841
Come on. Let's go.
Bye, dad.

29:00.842 --> 29:02.190
Bye-bye.
Bye.

29:09.855 --> 29:11.120
What's that for?

29:11.714 --> 29:12.953
I love you.

29:15.077 --> 29:16.209
I know.

30:19.202 --> 30:20.450
That was Miami-Dade.

30:20.674 --> 30:22.558
Apparently Yanavich didn't care
too much for the sun and sand.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.276
He was only there for a
year, and then he moved

30:24.277 --> 30:27.272
back to Brooklyn, bought
that cop bar out on Fulton.

30:27.922 --> 30:30.394
How does Yanavich afford a
bar on a cop's pension?

30:30.395 --> 30:31.560
Why don't we ask him?

30:34.367 --> 30:35.830
We better handle this, bro.

30:36.195 --> 30:38.376
Let's see what we got before
we bring her in on this.

30:50.165 --> 30:52.201
Sir.
Beckett, I think we have a lead.

30:52.652 --> 30:53.621
What'd you find?

30:53.622 --> 30:55.783
Meet me at the hangar where
we found the stolen chopper,

30:55.784 --> 30:58.678
and I'll explain everything there.
Okay. I'm on my way.

31:07.377 --> 31:09.280
...Maybe in the Hall of Fame, who knows?

31:09.399 --> 31:11.509
Mike Yanavich?
That's me.

31:11.719 --> 31:14.649
Detective Esposito, and
this is Detective Ryan.

31:14.650 --> 31:15.847
Can we talk to you for a minute?

31:16.030 --> 31:17.547
Sure. Want a drink?

31:17.548 --> 31:19.642
You own this place?
Free and clear.

31:19.643 --> 31:22.192
How do you manage that on a cop's pension

31:22.193 --> 31:24.867
if you don't mind me asking?
You get shot on the job,

31:25.423 --> 31:28.234
start drawing a disability
pension after you retire.

31:28.235 --> 31:30.061
You worked the records
room at the 12th, right?

31:30.062 --> 31:31.956
Decade ago. So what?

31:31.957 --> 31:34.950
Some records went missing on your watch,

31:34.951 --> 31:36.223
and some got altered.

31:36.224 --> 31:37.907
Yeah, well, I don't doubt it.

31:37.908 --> 31:40.750
I mean, uh, it wasn't like it is today.

31:40.930 --> 31:43.268
We didn't make a federal case
out of everything back then.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.191
You graduated from the Police Academy

31:45.192 --> 31:47.429
with John Raglan and Gary McCallister.

31:47.430 --> 31:51.690
Mm-hmm, and 40 other guys.
Listen, I read the papers.

31:51.691 --> 31:54.272
I know Raglan and McCallister road dirty,

31:54.273 --> 31:56.076
but I didn't have any part of it.

31:56.285 --> 31:59.740
I mean, I knew 'em to say
hi, talk some baseball,

31:59.741 --> 32:01.890
maybe bitch about the A.C.L.U.

32:01.891 --> 32:04.203
They used to drink here
before I bought the place.

32:04.204 --> 32:05.484
Do you know if Raglan or McCallister

32:05.485 --> 32:07.348
were tight with anybody else?

32:07.511 --> 32:10.924
Yeah. Some black kid used to
follow 'em around, a rookie.

32:11.856 --> 32:14.425
I got a picture of 'em somewhere up here.

32:16.220 --> 32:19.695
Yeah. That's him.

32:20.683 --> 32:22.717
The hell was his name?

32:23.975 --> 32:25.768
Ah. Montgomery.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.394
Yeah, McCallister and
Raglan trained that kid.

32:28.766 --> 32:31.329
Montgomery said he didn't
know either of these guys.

32:32.892 --> 32:35.514
Hey! What the hell's the matter with you?

32:37.834 --> 32:38.713
Hey!

32:40.880 --> 32:44.335
You know it's him.
Montgomery's our third cop.

32:44.336 --> 32:46.166
He's the one who altered those records.

32:46.633 --> 32:49.901
How can you even say that?
How could you even think that?!

32:49.902 --> 32:51.736
Montgomery brought us in to Homicide.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.939
What do we got, a picture?!
Think about it.

32:54.645 --> 32:57.108
Why else did he want us
to take Lockwood out?

32:57.109 --> 32:59.378
Because Lockwood leads us to him.

33:00.302 --> 33:01.722
He's been lying to us.

33:02.078 --> 33:03.942
He's been lying to us the whole time.

33:05.854 --> 33:06.396
No.

33:06.728 --> 33:08.251
Hey! Get off me!

33:09.372 --> 33:10.288
Ah.

33:13.132 --> 33:14.129
Aah!

33:14.130 --> 33:15.522
Go ahead! Go ahead!

33:26.252 --> 33:27.435
Beckett.

33:34.019 --> 33:35.143
Captain?

33:38.337 --> 33:39.314
Captain?

33:39.467 --> 33:40.337
Over here.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.594
Put the gun away, Roy.

34:19.221 --> 34:20.585
Kate, I'm not going to jail for this.

34:20.585 --> 34:22.322
I can't put my family through that.

34:24.152 --> 34:25.355
Why?

34:26.045 --> 34:28.007
I was a rookie when it happened, Kate.

34:31.034 --> 34:32.842
McCallister and Raglan were heroes to me.

34:32.844 --> 34:34.625
I believed in what we were doing.

34:35.871 --> 34:38.014
We were just gonna snatch
Pulgatti that night.

34:38.568 --> 34:40.775
Bob Armen wasn't even supposed to be there.

34:41.284 --> 34:44.539
Armen reached for my gun.
That's when I heard the shot.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.400
I didn't even know it was
my gun that went off

34:46.402 --> 34:47.992
until Armen went down.

34:48.235 --> 34:50.292
Then McCallister pulled me into the van.

34:51.458 --> 34:52.349
I remember him saying,

34:52.350 --> 34:54.342
"It's okay, kid. It's not your fault.

34:54.985 --> 34:57.101
Happens in this town every day."

34:57.336 --> 34:59.356
McCallister and Raglan tried to drown it,

35:00.245 --> 35:01.664
but not me.

35:01.817 --> 35:03.554
I put it all into the job, Kate.

35:03.555 --> 35:06.181
I became the best cop I could be.

35:07.701 --> 35:10.179
And then when you walked into the 12th...

35:10.706 --> 35:12.705
I felt the hand of God.

35:13.481 --> 35:15.176
I knew he was giving me another chance,

35:15.177 --> 35:16.374
and I thought,

35:17.639 --> 35:20.462
if I could protect you the way
I should've protected her...

35:21.987 --> 35:24.057
Did you kill my mother?

35:24.058 --> 35:25.306
No, that was years later,

35:25.307 --> 35:28.251
but she died because of
what we did that night.

35:28.252 --> 35:31.470
Then who killed her?
I don't know how,

35:31.471 --> 35:33.709
but somehow, he figured
out what we had done,

35:33.901 --> 35:35.012
and he could've turned us all in.

35:35.013 --> 35:37.259
Instead, he demanded the ransom money.

35:37.618 --> 35:39.555
He took that money to become what he is,

35:39.556 --> 35:42.344
and God forgive me, but that
may be my greatest sin.

35:42.345 --> 35:43.996
Give me a name.

35:45.273 --> 35:46.961
You owe me that, Roy.
No, Kate.

35:46.962 --> 35:48.897
I give you a name, I know you.
You'll run straight at him.

35:48.898 --> 35:50.450
I might as well shoot you where you stand.

35:50.451 --> 35:54.127
That's why you brought me
here, isn't it, to kill me?

35:54.381 --> 35:57.033
No, I brought you here to lure them.

35:57.868 --> 35:59.352
You baited them?

35:59.548 --> 36:01.197
And now they're coming.

36:01.434 --> 36:02.672
I need you to leave.

36:02.673 --> 36:04.676
They are coming to kill you,
and I'm not gonna let 'em.

36:04.677 --> 36:07.050
I'm gonna end this.
I'm not going anywhere, sir.

36:07.051 --> 36:10.520
Yes, you are.
Castle, get her outta here.

36:11.142 --> 36:12.985
Captain, I--
Don't argue. That's why I called you.

36:12.986 --> 36:15.135
Get her outta here. Now.
Captain, please.

36:15.136 --> 36:17.458
Just listen to me.
You don't have to do this.

36:17.459 --> 36:21.259
Kate-- no, please.
No, sir...I forgive you.

36:21.655 --> 36:23.702
I forgive you.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.720
This is my spot, Kate.

36:27.248 --> 36:29.967
This is where I stand.
No.

36:30.145 --> 36:32.582
Castle.
No, no, sir, please,

36:32.583 --> 36:34.968
listen to me. You don't have to do this.

36:34.969 --> 36:37.648
Castle, get her outta here now!
You don't have to--

36:37.649 --> 36:39.131
Sir, please.
Kate. Kate.

36:39.132 --> 36:42.043
No.
God, Castle, let me go!

36:42.044 --> 36:43.057
No!

36:44.555 --> 36:47.458
Let me go. Please!

36:47.459 --> 36:48.719
No!

36:52.801 --> 36:55.110
Please. Please.

36:55.876 --> 36:58.115
Shh. Shh. Oh...

37:07.510 --> 37:11.491
Shh. Shh. I'm sorry. Shh. Shh.

37:16.827 --> 37:18.075
Where is she, Roy?

37:18.820 --> 37:20.251
You can't have her.

37:20.455 --> 37:23.827
I told you, it's her or your family.

37:28.165 --> 37:29.759
Don't be stupid.

37:31.937 --> 37:33.867
You can't hide her from us,

37:34.727 --> 37:35.815
from me.

37:35.974 --> 37:37.778
You got that ass backwards, boy.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.536
You can't hide from me.

37:41.284 --> 37:42.114
Oh!

38:11.209 --> 38:13.401
And that was what, your last stand?

38:14.405 --> 38:16.182
That's just sad, Roy.

38:16.183 --> 38:18.160
I'm just gonna kill her anyway.

38:18.394 --> 38:19.329
No...

38:20.280 --> 38:21.394
You're not...

38:21.846 --> 38:23.339
And he's not.

38:23.821 --> 38:25.683
I saw to that.

38:26.217 --> 38:27.911
You're done, Lockwood.

38:28.076 --> 38:29.477
We both are.

39:22.413 --> 39:23.491
No one...

39:25.140 --> 39:28.379
No one outside of this immediate family

39:28.607 --> 39:31.594
ever needs to know about this.

39:33.180 --> 39:34.814
As far as the world is concerned,

39:34.815 --> 39:36.796
Roy Montgomery died a hero.

39:40.308 --> 39:41.847
We owe it to him...

39:44.565 --> 39:45.985
All of us.

40:38.710 --> 40:41.499
Roy Montgomery taught me

40:41.798 --> 40:44.253
what it meant to be a cop

40:47.603 --> 40:51.145
he taught me that we are
found by our choices

40:52.906 --> 40:55.382
that we are more than mistakes

40:58.249 --> 40:59.862
Captain Montgomery once said to me

40:59.863 --> 41:02.129
that for us, there is no victory.

41:02.819 --> 41:04.518
There are only battles.

41:05.905 --> 41:08.265
And in the end, the best you can hope for

41:08.685 --> 41:12.237
is to find a place to make your stand.

41:13.659 --> 41:15.128
And if you're very lucky...

41:16.198 --> 41:19.304
You find someone willing to stand with you.

41:25.519 --> 41:28.517
Our captain would want us
to carry on the fight.

41:31.859 --> 41:34.019
And even if there is no victory,

41:34.923 --> 41:36.642
he would want us to stand together.

41:37.321 --> 41:38.057
Kate!

41:40.839 --> 41:42.611
Down! Everybody, down!

41:42.612 --> 41:44.080
Where'd the shot come from?
Lanie, get down!

41:46.755 --> 41:47.776
No, no, no, Kate.

41:47.777 --> 41:49.673
Find that shooter!
Shh.

41:49.674 --> 41:50.848
Kate, please.

41:51.334 --> 41:52.913
Stay with me, Kate.

41:53.357 --> 41:55.794
Don't leave me. Please.

41:56.608 --> 41:58.889
Stay with me, okay?

41:59.276 --> 42:00.864
Kate...

42:01.367 --> 42:02.701
I love you.

42:03.579 --> 42:05.905
I love you, Kate.
