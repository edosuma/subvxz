00:05.060 --> 00:09.230
Congratulations...how is he different from the four hundred other "the one's"?

00:09.230 --> 00:12.450
Well, he's gorgeous, he's charming, he's funny.

00:12.450 --> 00:13.490
Sounds different so far...

00:13.490 --> 00:18.240
Did I mention that he's gorgeous? His name is Alex. I met him this morning at the Other Realm post office.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.870
Oh, please tell me his picture wasn't on the wall.

00:20.870 --> 00:26.750
Alec happens to be a very fine actor. He is currently starring in the Other Realm soap opera,

00:26.750 --> 00:34.050
Oh, ask him who's the real father of Charlene's baby. My money's on Bob the dancing gargoyle.

00:34.050 --> 00:40.430
Hilda, I know what I say will have absolutely no effect on you, but please, be careful. Go slow.

00:40.430 --> 00:43.180
It's just that we don't want you to end up with someone who isn't right for you.

00:43.180 --> 00:49.520
You don't have to worry. I have my eyes open and my feet firmly on the ground.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.110
Did I mention that he's gorgeous?

00:52.110 --> 00:53.780
Did I mention you're about to hit your head?

00:53.780 --> 00:54.490
Ow!

00:54.490 --> 00:57.490
I guess it's true, love hurts.

01:40.070 --> 01:41.830
Training for the Olympic clothes toss?

01:41.830 --> 01:44.290
I'm looking for my black T-shirt, have you seen it?

01:44.290 --> 01:46.370
Not only have I seen it, I washed it.

01:46.370 --> 01:49.670
You washed my T-shirt? How could you?

01:49.670 --> 01:54.840
You're welcome. Happy to do you the favour. Here, smell......fresh as a springtime morning.

01:54.840 --> 01:59.970
The only thing I hate more than springtime, is morning. New rule: never wash my stuff.

01:59.970 --> 02:02.600
Newer rule: OK, I won't, so there.

02:05.270 --> 02:08.979
Fair warning, Roxie's on the warpath. It's going to be a long, ugly weekend.

02:08.979 --> 02:10.979
Oh, not for me. I've got a big date.

02:10.979 --> 02:14.860
Aargh, you know, the person who finishes the pot is supposed to make a new one.

02:14.860 --> 02:18.950
Oh, I guess that's you. But before you do, I need your opinion.

02:18.950 --> 02:25.950
I'm going out with Josh tonight, and I can't decide what to wear. Hot and sexy, or cool and coy?

02:25.950 --> 02:27.410
You guys are going out again?

02:27.410 --> 02:33.170
No, we're staying in. I'm making dinner...well, actually, the restaurant's making dinner. But I'm putting it on the plate.

02:33.170 --> 02:35.590
Oh, that sounds like a pretty romantic evening.

02:35.590 --> 02:45.100
You're right. Neither of these are romantic enough. But, I have got the perfect little off-the-shoulder number in my closet. Josh will love it.

02:46.140 --> 02:48.100
I'm so glad you introduced us.

02:48.100 --> 02:51.520
Don't mention it......ever again!

02:51.520 --> 02:56.650
Sabrina, just to let you know, I'm videotaping the meteor show tonight, so I'll need to run some cables through your bedroom window.

02:56.650 --> 02:59.280
You're gonna leave my window open? It's thirty degrees out!

02:59.280 --> 03:06.450
Come on, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Unless I live to be a hundred and forty seven or I freeze my body. But I have an aversion to cold.

03:06.450 --> 03:08.330
But it's OK to turn me into a popsicle?

03:08.330 --> 03:09.750
I knew I could count on you.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.380
I say we do our project on the Gold Rush.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.710
I say Prohibition.

03:16.710 --> 03:18.920
What is so wrong with the Expedition of Lewis and Clark?

03:18.920 --> 03:20.010
Oh, come on!

03:20.010 --> 03:21.430
Why do you always bring up stuff like that?

03:21.430 --> 03:28.270
Enough! Since you can't make a decision, I will. We live in Boston. We all like to party. We're gonna' to do the Boston Tea Party.

03:28.270 --> 03:31.310
The Boston Tea Party? That's like so sixth grade.

03:31.310 --> 03:32.600
Yeah, I don't like parties.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.690
I don't like Boston.

03:33.690 --> 03:35.400
People, we have to agree on something.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.770
Let's take a coffee break.

03:36.770 --> 03:37.820
I agree.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.820
I can't remember, does two head-bangs mean regular or decaf?

03:44.820 --> 03:49.870
I am in the study group from hell. I mean, they can't make a decision and they won't listen to anything I have to say.

03:49.870 --> 03:54.960
Oh, I'd love to get into it but I have to get a haircut before my date tonight. Morgan's making me dinner.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.050
Yeah, I know, and I bet she's planning one or two surprises for after dinner.

03:58.050 --> 04:00.260
I hope one of them is cake.

04:01.510 --> 04:04.590
Hey, argh...you're OK with this whole me and Morgan thing, right?

04:04.590 --> 04:08.310
Yeah, you know. I mean, who introduced you? Me.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.220
I know, and it's working out great.

04:10.220 --> 04:12.890
Yeah, everything's working out great.

04:12.890 --> 04:15.310
Don't touch my stuff!

04:15.310 --> 04:16.190
Don't close the window!

04:16.190 --> 04:17.899
Morgan, I love you.

04:17.899 --> 04:20.070
Yes, I'll marry you.

04:20.070 --> 04:21.110
Remember the Alamo.

04:21.110 --> 04:22.650
Go away, go away, go away!

04:22.650 --> 04:23.820
Fine...

04:23.820 --> 04:28.580
Oh, no, no, no, sorry, I was just you know, swatting away some personal demons.

04:28.580 --> 04:33.290
Well I just wanted to introduce you to my new "friend", Alec. This is Sabrina.

04:33.290 --> 04:33.710
Hello.

04:33.710 --> 04:34.170
Hi.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.460
Did I lie? Isn't he gorgeous!

04:36.460 --> 04:39.300
Hilda, stop, you're gonna' spoil me.

04:39.300 --> 04:45.720
No, you're going to spoil me. He's taking me to the Rings of Saturn, the best amusement park in the galaxy.

04:45.720 --> 04:51.180
The happiest place not on Earth. Check your troubles at the door, and have the time of your life.

04:51.180 --> 04:53.180
Check your troubles at the door?

04:53.180 --> 04:55.770
Well I don't care, I don't care!

04:55.770 --> 04:57.770
When do we leave?

04:57.770 --> 04:59.820
Sabrina, it's our first date.

04:59.820 --> 05:02.740
Well then you'll need a chaperone. Come on, kids.

05:07.530 --> 05:10.790
This is so much fun. You know, getting away from my problems is just what the doctor ordered.

05:10.790 --> 05:16.000
Did I mention that Alec plays the handsome and brooding Dr Terrance Honeycott on the highly acclaimed daytime drama, ?

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
Listen, and listen good, Nurse Wilson. No one dies on my watch.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.840
Don't you love it when he does that?

05:23.840 --> 05:26.720
Yeah, I have chills. So, who wants to go ride the rollercoaster?

05:26.720 --> 05:27.260
I do!

05:27.260 --> 05:29.350
Oh, pass. Yeah, wreaks havoc with the hair.

05:29.350 --> 05:31.470
Oh, well, I like to live on the edge, so 'gotta go.

05:31.470 --> 05:33.890
How about the house of mirrors?

05:33.890 --> 05:35.940
Again? We've been there three times.

05:35.940 --> 05:37.770
And yet I never tire of it.

05:37.770 --> 05:42.860
We could do something different. You could row me through the tunnel of love with those big, strong arms.

05:42.860 --> 05:48.700
Well, rowing would be a great workout for my upper body, but argh...I'm in the mood to see all of me.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.830
House of mirrors it is.

05:51.830 --> 05:58.960
Whoa! That rollercoaster was great. I don't know what Alec's problem was with the hair.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.380
Hey, Cousin Itt, step on up and grab a meteor.

06:02.380 --> 06:03.710
What do I have to do?

06:03.710 --> 06:05.210
Just aim at Earth and give it a hurl.

06:05.210 --> 06:10.680
That sounds like fun, and after that rollercoaster I am ready to hurl. This one's for you, Miles.

06:18.850 --> 06:21.310
Awesome! That one looked like it was aimed at me.

06:23.570 --> 06:27.070
We got ourselves a winner! Here's your prize, little lady.

06:27.070 --> 06:31.570
Oh, argh...no thanks. One is more than enough.

06:33.740 --> 06:39.040
God, I love that place! Did you notice that even in the most distorted mirrors I still look great?

06:39.040 --> 06:41.790
No...but I did notice that your head gets bigger.

06:41.790 --> 06:42.630
Really?

06:45.880 --> 06:50.680
Alec, I hate to talk about me for a moment, but do you ever think about anything other than how you look?

06:50.680 --> 06:54.310
Certainly. Sometimes I think about how other people think I look.

06:57.020 --> 07:00.690
I can hurl a meteor all the way to Earth, but I can't make a free throw with a churro wrapper?

07:02.310 --> 07:03.650
No need, I got it.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.320
Katrina?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.190
Your one and only evil twin.

07:07.940 --> 07:13.280
I know. I never forget a face, especially when it's mine. I, I thought you were locked up for eternity for pushing me into that volcano.

07:13.280 --> 07:19.460
I had a good lawyer. I'm still in jail, but I get reduced sentence if I do community service. Did you gain weight?

07:19.580 --> 07:21.120
You are so evil.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.500
Sorry. I might be nicer if I had your life.

07:23.630 --> 07:23.670
Believe me, my life is not all fun and games.

07:27.050 --> 07:37.100
Well, maybe it is right now, but back at college, I've got a roommate who's giving me the cold shoulder, another one who's trying to freeze me out, and another one who's getting all hot and heavy with this guy Josh I kinda' like.

07:37.100 --> 07:43.690
Oh, yeah? Well I'm sharing a filthy four by four cell with the most obnoxious piece of trailer trash in the Other Realm. Sorry if I don't seem sympathetic.

07:45.060 --> 07:49.110
Look, I gotta' find my Aunt Hilda and her boyfriend. It was a pleasure seeing you again, Katrina.

07:49.110 --> 07:49.860
Pleasure was all yours.

07:52.780 --> 07:58.580
You know, the worst thing a person can do is go through life being bitter. Maybe you should think about making some changes.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.660
I intend too, starting now.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.750
Good luck, Katrina. Bye.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.090
Don't you mean "Sabrina"?

08:13.180 --> 08:15.010
Oh what's the matter Hilda, you seem out of sorts.

08:15.340 --> 08:16.140
You actually noticed?

08:16.260 --> 08:18.680
No, the ticket-taker at the house of mirrors mentioned it.

08:19.180 --> 08:23.190
I want you to take me home right now, Alec. There's Sabrina. Sabrina!

08:23.980 --> 08:25.350
Finally, I've been looking all over for you.

08:26.520 --> 08:27.690
Why are you wearing a maintenance uniform?

08:28.400 --> 08:30.570
I, uh, won it, at the house of garbage.

08:30.650 --> 08:33.820
Garbage? Oh, I wonder if you can see yourself in the cans...

08:33.950 --> 08:40.039
Can it, Dr. I-Love-Myself. Sabrina, I hate to spoil your fun, but we're going back to the Mortal Realm.

08:40.159 --> 08:45.580
Not a problem, that's exactly where I wanna' be. So long, Sabrina. Have a nice eternity.

08:52.880 --> 08:58.890
Oh, home sweet home, just like I imagined it...I mean, remembered it. Oh, ugly cat.

08:58.890 --> 09:06.690
Well that really hurts coming from someone in a maintenance uniform! Who wants to play, "You Don't Know Jack"? How about you, boyfriend?

09:06.810 --> 09:08.940
Oh, sorry Salem, Alec was just leaving.

09:09.110 --> 09:16.530
Oh, I'm in no hurry. Did I tell you I once played Jack in the national tour of Jack and the Beanstalk? Fee, fie, foe...

09:16.740 --> 09:19.660
I believe the word you're looking for is "fum".

09:21.620 --> 09:24.790
You're early. I'm Zelda. You must be "the one".

09:24.790 --> 09:27.330
Ah, the one in your thoughts or the one in your dreams?

09:27.630 --> 09:29.630
Ew! Zelda, kitchen, now!

09:32.250 --> 09:34.220
Well, this has really been fun, but I gotta' get going.

09:34.220 --> 09:39.220
Take one of these as a souvenir. Good luck with your problems back home.

09:39.350 --> 09:42.390
Thanks. You know, they probably weren't as bad as I thought they were.

09:44.560 --> 09:49.730
All travellers leaving the Other Realm, please have your passports ready and passports available for inspection.

09:49.810 --> 09:53.940
Whoa, not so fast, blondie. I can't let you leave the Other Realm. This passport's no good.

09:54.110 --> 09:58.280
Of course it's good, I use it every time I come to the Other Realm. I've never been stopped before. Let me see that.

09:58.700 --> 10:08.040
Ah! Why that evil little twin. She switched passports on me, this is not my passport. My name is Sabrina, not Katrina. Do I look like an evil twin to you?

10:08.040 --> 10:11.670
I don't know, lady. I'm not a psychologist, I scan stuff.

10:14.130 --> 10:14.170
Look, you're making a big mistake!

10:14.170 --> 10:15.510
Arrivederci, baby.

10:17.220 --> 10:24.720
OK, stay calm. Don't panic......let me out of here!

10:26.060 --> 10:27.060
Save your breath, honey.

10:28.310 --> 10:29.020
Aunt Zelda?

10:29.020 --> 10:36.990
No, her evil twin Jezebelda. I've been busier than a pair of jumper cables at a family reunion, trying to get my sorry butt out of here.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.490
If they ain't springing me, they sure ain't springing you.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.200
It's amazing how much you look like my Aunt Zelda.

10:43.370 --> 10:48.660
Sshh! Bite your tongue, girlie. So tell me, how is that skinny-legged little egghead?

10:48.910 --> 10:51.250
Oh, oh, she's fine...I'll...I'll...I'll give her your best.

10:52.670 --> 10:55.090
You were right, Zelda. The one is not the one.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.170
Then what is he still doing in our house?

10:58.510 --> 11:02.890
Probably admiring his reflection in a doorknob. I tried to get rid of him, but he won't take a hint.

11:02.890 --> 11:06.220
Well stop hinting. Just go up there and tell him the truth.

11:06.220 --> 11:11.600
That he's a self-centred, arrogant ego-maniac, and he doesn't deserve a treasure like me?

11:11.600 --> 11:13.770
First part sounded good.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.450
OK, new outfit, new realm...I'm ready to do some evil.

11:19.450 --> 11:21.410
Sabrina, have you seen Alec?

11:21.410 --> 11:23.700
Oh, he's at your vanity, waxing his arm hair.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.910
Oh, I should've listened to you before.

11:25.910 --> 11:28.120
Of course you should have. What'd I say?

11:28.120 --> 11:33.630
That the last thing you wanted was for me to end up with someone who isn't right for me. And this guy is so wrong.

11:33.630 --> 11:37.710
I said that was the last thing I'd want? Because I think you misinterpreted what I was saying.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.050
Then what were you saying?

11:39.050 --> 11:46.140
Well, in a nut-shell, you're over six-hundred years old. You can't afford to be picky. You should grab this guy before he dumps you for a hot little five hundred year old.

11:46.140 --> 11:51.100
Sabrina, I can't stand Alec. And even Zelda says that if I feel that way, I should get rid of him.

11:51.100 --> 11:54.400
Why do you think she said that? She wants him for herself.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.520
You think?

11:55.520 --> 11:56.270
I know.

11:56.270 --> 11:57.940
Well, he is gorgeous.

11:57.940 --> 12:00.440
That's what Zelda said repeatedly.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.780
Ah, that skinny-legged little vamp. Thanks for tipping me off, Sabrina. I owe you one.

12:04.780 --> 12:10.540
Anytime. Hey, you know what? You could do me a favour right now. I sprained my finger on the Tilt-a-Whirl. Could you zap me back to college?

12:10.540 --> 12:16.340
Huh, so this is my room. It's colder than my cell!

12:16.340 --> 12:24.010
This meteor shower is unbelievable. Thanks for letting me run my cables through your window. You're a real friend, Sabrina.

12:24.010 --> 12:27.930
Well, any friend of Sabrina's is an enemy of mine.

12:34.690 --> 12:35.980
I am so evil.

12:43.070 --> 12:44.910
No matter what I do, my magic just won't work!

12:46.200 --> 12:53.500
That's why they call it prison, honey. I'll tell you what's a crime. That Zelda gets to run wild while I'm locked up in here.

12:53.620 --> 12:58.630
I was the pretty one, I was the talented one. I was the one who was supposed to go places.

12:59.170 --> 12:59.960
What happened?

12:59.960 --> 13:04.720
I was a bad, bad girl. Started a little thing called the bubonic plague.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.970
That's awful!

13:05.970 --> 13:06.590
Thank you.

13:06.590 --> 13:09.760
You know, that's like one of the worst disasters in human history.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.720
Now you're embarrassing me.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.020
You're lying on my bed. You know how I feel about you touching my stuff.

13:17.020 --> 13:22.320
Yeah, it's right here in your diary, October 3rd, the same entry where you admit you still suck your thumb.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.700
Have you lost your mind? This is my personal property!

13:25.700 --> 13:29.620
Oh, well if you didn't want me to read it then you shouldn't have left it locked in that little box underneath your mattress.

13:29.620 --> 13:35.830
Finally! I've been trying to get in this room for twenty minutes. Thanks to you unplugging my cables, I missed the best part of the meteor shower.

13:35.830 --> 13:37.500
At least she didn't read your diary.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.040
Sabrina, you're acting so weird. This isn't like you at all.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.630
How far in my diary did you get?

13:41.630 --> 13:43.840
Enough to know that you had a dream about Miles last night.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.340
Really?

13:47.340 --> 13:51.470
Don't get too excited. You were dead.

13:54.140 --> 13:57.190
Oh, Sabrina, don't eat those. They're for my date with Josh.

13:57.980 --> 13:58.480
Josh?

13:58.480 --> 14:03.150
Yeah, he'll be here any minute. I can't wait. So, how's my outfit?

14:03.150 --> 14:04.740
I don't know, what are you gonna' wear?

14:04.740 --> 14:06.200
This...

14:06.200 --> 14:09.320
Oh...I guess it's a look.

14:09.320 --> 14:15.500
I'm changing. If that's Josh, tell him I'll be down in five minutes!

14:19.670 --> 14:20.460
My pleasure.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.800
Hey, Sabrina. Where's Morgan?

14:24.800 --> 14:31.510
Morgan? Oh, Morgan, um...yeah, you know what? She just got very sick and she told me she has to cancel.

14:31.510 --> 14:34.270
Really? She seemed fine when I talked to her twenty minutes ago.

14:34.270 --> 14:35.310
Came on very suddenly.

14:35.310 --> 14:39.850
Oh, well, so much for dinner. Guess it's me and my microwave tonight.

14:39.850 --> 14:42.940
Or...I could be your date.

14:44.980 --> 14:47.070
Hey, Sabrina, I thought you didn't wanna' go out with me.

14:47.070 --> 14:51.320
Why wouldn't I wanna' go out with someone as charming and handsome as you?

14:51.320 --> 14:53.490
I have no idea.

14:55.580 --> 15:00.960
Listen, if I get that guard to spring you, will you promise to poison your Aunt Zelda?

15:00.960 --> 15:12.340
With what? I mean, no!! There's gotta' be a way out of here. And I think I just found it...

15:12.340 --> 15:20.060
Now listen, and listen good, Nurse Wilson. No one dies on my watch.

15:20.060 --> 15:27.820
Bravo. We make one heck of a team. Dr Honeycutt and his swarthy feline sidekick, Gustavo.

15:27.820 --> 15:29.780
Alec, snack time.

15:29.780 --> 15:33.120
What is that cretin still doing here?

15:33.120 --> 15:34.830
He's our cat. He lives here.

15:34.830 --> 15:37.620
Not that cretin, the other one. I thought you were going to dump him.

15:37.620 --> 15:43.710
You don't fool me for a minute, sister. I'm onto you. Sabrina told me about your plan to try to steal Alec.

15:43.710 --> 15:44.590
What?

15:44.590 --> 15:56.560
Oh, look. A meteor. It's a message from Sabrina. "I'm trapped in the Other Realm. Katrina stole my passport and switched places with me. Zelda's evil twin says, hi ya'll".

15:56.560 --> 16:00.560
She's trapped with Jezebelda. We've got to get her out of there.

16:00.560 --> 16:08.900
Wait a minute. If Sabrina's back there, that means it was Katrina who told me I shouldn't dump Alec. Hey, pretty boy!

16:08.900 --> 16:11.150
Not now, I'm watching here.

16:11.150 --> 16:13.910
Well, watch what happens next. We're breaking up.

16:13.910 --> 16:17.990
Oh, a breakup scene, I love those. What's my motivation?

16:17.990 --> 16:18.950
I hate you.

16:18.950 --> 16:20.250
Perfect.

16:20.250 --> 16:23.580
Dr. Honeycutt, you're history, stat!

16:23.580 --> 16:28.590
Now we've got to get Sabrina a new passport, stat!

16:28.590 --> 16:33.630
And hope that Katrina hasn't caused to much damage, stat! I just like saying stat.

16:33.630 --> 16:35.340
Good night, Josh.

16:45.690 --> 16:49.110
Sabrina Spellman, perfect. This should get to the Other Realm in no time.

16:49.110 --> 16:51.400
You're a real whiz on the computer, Salem.

16:51.400 --> 16:56.990
Thanks to my new counterfeiting software. By the way, here's the money I owe you.

16:56.990 --> 17:00.540
I can't believe you stole my boyfriend!

17:00.540 --> 17:06.170
Well, all's fair in love and war...actually, nothing's fair in love and war, they should change that.

17:06.170 --> 17:12.720
You knew that I had this special evening planned. What you did was just......plain evil!

17:12.720 --> 17:15.630
Well, then my work is done. For tonight, anyway.

17:15.630 --> 17:18.930
Sabrina, you going out with Josh was...

17:22.640 --> 17:23.349
Hello, Katrina.

17:23.349 --> 17:25.640
Sabrina, how did you get out?

17:25.640 --> 17:28.230
A little luck and a good fastball. Now, hand over my passport.

17:28.230 --> 17:29.070
Never.

17:29.070 --> 17:31.900
Wait a minute, I have my magic back.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.280
Drat.

17:35.280 --> 17:44.000
It gets even worse. I spoke to your parole board, and you're gonna' be pining for the days you swept up gum wrappers. You're in the big house for the long haul.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.790
You are so evil.

17:45.790 --> 17:48.040
I learnt from the best. Buh-bye!

17:48.040 --> 17:53.840
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.510
It's horrible to see you too.

17:55.510 --> 17:57.050
Did you gain a little weight?

17:57.050 --> 17:59.010
Did your legs get skinnier?

17:59.010 --> 18:02.140
Is that a whisker coming out of your chin?

18:02.140 --> 18:04.850
Is that a chin coming out of your other chin?

18:04.850 --> 18:06.940
Lord I missed you girl.

18:06.940 --> 18:08.150
I missed you too.

18:08.150 --> 18:12.730
It's tempting to leave her this way, but...

18:12.730 --> 18:18.780
...truly, truly, evil...when did you change?

18:18.780 --> 18:21.620
Oh, just now. I'm no longer evil.

18:21.620 --> 18:32.590
Anyway, if I thought for one second that you were interested in Josh, I never would've gone after him. Well, actually, I would have but just...slower.

18:32.590 --> 18:35.800
Wait a minute, so you're saying I went out with Josh?

18:35.800 --> 18:39.930
Don't play innocent with me. I saw you kissing him on the porch.

18:39.930 --> 18:50.350
I kissed him? Oh, oh, you thought that was a kiss? No, we were just, you know...rehearsing, for a play called...I'm the worst liar in the world.

18:51.860 --> 18:55.480
Look, Morgan, I'm really sorry. OK, I had no idea what I was doing. Please forgive me?

18:55.480 --> 19:07.410
Alright. I'll forgive you the Josh thing. But what you said about my outfit...that is gonna' take some time.

19:07.410 --> 19:12.040
OK, one problem solved. Nextâ€¦

19:12.040 --> 19:17.210
"Dear diary, I'm really happy to be out of my aunt's house and living on my own".

19:17.210 --> 19:18.800
You're reading my diary?

19:18.800 --> 19:22.090
I'm trying too, but it's hard to stay awake. You have an exceptionally dull life.

19:22.090 --> 19:26.930
Let me guess. I read your diary, so you're reading mine and you're trying to even the score.

19:26.930 --> 19:29.730
Unless this gets a lot better, we're nowhere near even.

19:29.730 --> 19:37.940
It doesn't, trust me. Nothing out of the ordinary ever happens to me. Look, Roxie, I'm really sorry. I never should've invaded your privacy.

19:37.940 --> 19:42.490
All I can say is, if you ever mention September 15th to anybody, you're dead.

19:42.490 --> 19:45.200
It's as if I never read it!

19:48.500 --> 19:51.960
Miles, um, I don't know what I did to you, but I'm sorry.

19:51.960 --> 20:01.090
"Sorry" doesn't cut it. When you unplugged my equipment, I missed the best part of the meteor shower. And there won't be another one like it for 129 years.

20:01.090 --> 20:07.060
Oh, I don't know about that, you know. Sometimes those people are a little off with their calculations. Look!

20:12.400 --> 20:16.190
I can't believe it! I gotta' get back up on the roof and film this.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.780
We're back.

20:24.410 --> 20:26.700
Hey, Josh, I just want to apologize for last night.

20:26.700 --> 20:27.830
For what?

20:27.830 --> 20:29.120
I'm afraid I was sending you mixed messages.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.370
I think the message was clear to both of us.

20:31.370 --> 20:34.500
Yeah, I think so too. So, what was the message you got?

20:34.500 --> 20:41.880
I don't know...the date, the kiss, everything, it just didn't feel right. I mean, it was just me, was it?

20:41.880 --> 20:45.090
No, it wasn't just you, and it definitely wasn't me.

20:45.090 --> 20:49.220
I think your first instinct was right on the money. We should just be friends.

20:49.220 --> 20:54.060
Yeah, friends are a good. You know, you can't have too many friends. So, friends.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.440
Just what I need, another friend.

21:04.490 --> 21:05.870
Mother's maiden name?

21:05.870 --> 21:07.320
Becker.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.240
Favourite dessert that doesn't involve chocolate?

21:09.240 --> 21:11.250
There isn't one. How long is this gonna' go on?

21:11.250 --> 21:14.670
Until we make absolutely sure that you are the real Sabrina.

21:14.670 --> 21:16.460
Say: woo-hoo.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.420
Woo-hoo!

21:17.420 --> 21:19.500
Imposter! Je'accuse!

21:19.500 --> 21:24.380
Back off, fur-ball, or I'm gonna' tell Aunt Zelda about the time I caught you in her lingerie draw trying on her lace-red...

21:24.380 --> 21:25.630
It's Sabrina!
