04:53.560 --> 04:54.721
An accident has

04:54.800 --> 04:56.680
<i>been reported at Chai Wan
Nuclear Power Station.</i>

06:50.080 --> 06:53.289
Hathaway. Cell search.
Hands behind you.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.002
Open 16.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.485
Go, go, go!

07:21.520 --> 07:23.204
Search everything.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.800
Get off that!
Hey!

07:31.480 --> 07:33.005
Take him down!

07:39.440 --> 07:40.726
One, two, three, up!

07:45.040 --> 07:46.883
Stay strong, <i>carnal.</i>

07:49.320 --> 07:52.210
This was found
in your cell.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.329
You added $900 to all your
pals' commissary accounts

07:55.400 --> 07:57.368
in your cell block.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.442
Is this the attack tool?

07:59.520 --> 08:00.885
With it,
you open up a terminal

08:01.000 --> 08:03.207
and that gives
you a command line?

08:03.280 --> 08:07.649
That how you broke into the network
and plussed-up the balances?

08:07.720 --> 08:08.720
No.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.007
I used it to call Santa
in the North Pole

08:11.080 --> 08:13.481
and told him to do
Christmas early this year.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.242
What do we know
about this guy?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.169
His grandfather was
a military commander

10:28.240 --> 10:29.571
in Shanghai in the '20s,

10:29.640 --> 10:32.564
in the '30s against the
Japanese through the Civil War.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.008
His father became
China's Undersecretary
for Trade to the UN.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.320
He came with to New York.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.528
Bronx High School
of Science, MIT.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.807
His sister's a network engineer
in the private sector.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.211
She grow up
in New York, too?

10:43.840 --> 10:44.966
No.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.129
He's a rising star in PLA's
Cyber Defense section.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.406
Liaise with them?

10:50.800 --> 10:54.122
It's inviting them
into the henhouse, Carol.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.208
Stanley, we go head-to-head
with the Chinese

10:56.280 --> 10:58.442
on their cyber intrusion
every day of the week.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.764
Not a bad idea to be face-to-face
working with them, for once.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.441
You monitor very closely what they
do and do not have access to.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.567
Okay?

11:12.880 --> 11:15.008
Okay?
Send the code.

11:25.640 --> 11:26.880
Okay.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.680
Let's go somewhere we can talk.
Hey, hey...

12:35.640 --> 12:38.007
English might be better.
Come on.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.451
Tomorrow? I can't.
It's impossible.
Why not?

12:47.520 --> 12:49.443
I've got
an optical-overlay network

12:49.520 --> 12:53.002
that's got to be up
in 17 days.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.287
They sent me
some code tonight.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.728
The black hat who hit
the Chai Wan reactor.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.366
When I looked at the
code, it was, uh...

13:02.000 --> 13:03.126
And?

13:04.560 --> 13:08.849
I have to have a network
engineer with me I can trust.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.810
Really trust.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.041
Like, 100%.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.964
When do we leave?

15:17.960 --> 15:21.009
<i>The meltdown in China
and the run-up in soy yesterday</i>

15:21.080 --> 15:24.527
<i>was facilitated
by the same RAT.</i>

15:24.600 --> 15:26.967
How it got loaded in
in the first place,
we don't know.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.283
But, once inside,
it de-cloaked and
became what it really is.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.522
A remote access tool.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.961
A RAT.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.362
The RAT's job was to open a back
door in our system and call home.

15:37.720 --> 15:42.203
The black hat then used his back
door to inject a second part.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.289
It's payload.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.847
That is what rode up soy.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.809
Now that we're looking at the
RAT and payload closely,

15:48.880 --> 15:50.006
we're thinking
they were...

15:50.080 --> 15:53.004
Written by different authors.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.083
How we figured that out
was through the coding in the RAT.

15:59.160 --> 16:02.482
Though several years old,
it is lean, graceful.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.564
The payload's coding,
on the other hand,
feels frenetic, confused...

16:05.640 --> 16:08.041
Frenetic?
Or overwritten?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.650
So, the question
we're dealing with is...

16:12.720 --> 16:15.041
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

16:16.160 --> 16:20.131
...and if it is two,
they may not be working
in close proximity.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.651
Daniels is qualified
in computer forensics.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.769
An intern could have
written that report.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.320
Oh, really?
And who do we need,
if not Daniels?

16:33.400 --> 16:36.165
And "liaise" in "liaison
group" implies mutuality.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.244
You don't like our boy,
what ideas are you
bringing to the dance?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.050
A man named Hathaway.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.886
He's a convicted hacker,

16:42.960 --> 16:46.123
serving 15 years in U.S.P.
Canaan in Waymart,
Pennsylvania.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.568
You telling me
some hacker in prison

16:48.640 --> 16:50.768
is hitting our
financial markets?

16:50.840 --> 16:53.047
No. But we want
Hathaway on the team

16:53.120 --> 16:54.849
so he can help out
the investigation.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.848
He hit four
major banks,

17:04.960 --> 17:07.247
ran up $46 million
in damages.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.084
And that's just
what we know about.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.968
You want the DOJ to do
anything other than laugh?

17:18.839 --> 17:21.445
Daniels said two authors
wrote the virus.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.089
I don't know who
wrote the second half,
but the first half, the RAT,

17:25.160 --> 17:28.687
the remote access tool that Daniels
called "lean and graceful"?

17:28.760 --> 17:31.366
One of the original authors
is me.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.727
I co-wrote it,

17:33.800 --> 17:36.041
as a gag,
years ago at MIT.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.681
And my roommate,
the genius lead author?

17:39.760 --> 17:41.091
Nicholas Hathaway.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.321
That's right.

17:43.120 --> 17:47.011
The hacker found the RAT
online and modified it.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.208
If we want to move
around within this code

17:49.280 --> 17:51.009
looking for clues to
the hacker's identity,

17:51.080 --> 17:53.162
we need it's lead architect.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.723
The reactor in China,
I heard about,

18:31.800 --> 18:34.121
but the spike
in soy futures...

18:35.960 --> 18:37.200
All right,
I didn't know any of this.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.442
We don't get a lot
of new news in here.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.002
The US government would like
your technical advice on this.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.641
In exchange for that,
we're going to furlough
you right out of here.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.246
You sign that
on the last page,

18:49.320 --> 18:50.685
and we'll get
you processed.

18:53.720 --> 18:54.881
You'll wear
an ankle bracelet

18:54.960 --> 18:56.610
and be accompanied
by a US Marshal.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.365
Your computer access
will be restricted.

18:59.440 --> 19:03.286
If you wanna study
the whole document,
you can go right ahead.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.446
I can come back
in a month or two.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.090
No, I'm done.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.520
You didn't sign it.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.164
Yeah.
Why would I sign it? Why?

19:19.240 --> 19:21.481
Because of the generosity
of the Assistant US Attorney

19:21.560 --> 19:22.971
in granting you a furlough.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.088
Both you and
the Assistant US Attorney

19:25.160 --> 19:26.844
can stick that
document up your ass.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.046
I'm sorry?

19:28.360 --> 19:29.964
Why are you sorry?

19:30.040 --> 19:32.611
I insulted you.
What are you sorry for?
I'm not sorry.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.688
Don't think you're gonna...
Hey.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.603
You wanna raise
me up out of here,

19:36.680 --> 19:38.728
solve your trade
exchange dilemma,

19:38.800 --> 19:41.371
and I get a furlough
for a couple of weeks?
You kidding me?

19:41.440 --> 19:43.522
You have any idea how much
progress you're gonna make

19:43.600 --> 19:45.762
on a strike this complex
without someone like me?

19:46.480 --> 19:47.606
Zero.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.125
This isn't a negotiation.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.326
I just made it one.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.040
You want me?
You pass this upstairs.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.930
If my assistance results
in the identification

19:56.000 --> 19:58.685
and the apprehension
of the guy you're after,

19:58.800 --> 20:01.007
I want you to commute
my sentence.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.324
If I come up empty,
you toss my ass
back in the can.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.449
Those are the terms.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.605
Guard.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.284
Interview's over.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.089
Barrett, how badly
do you need this guy?

20:49.240 --> 20:50.685
It's so good
to see you, bro.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.649
Not half as much as it
is for me to see you.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.569
Let's get out of here.

21:38.520 --> 21:43.401
So, you planned to reunite with your
friend from the moment you landed?

21:43.480 --> 21:45.244
It entered my mind.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.080
You okay?

22:24.280 --> 22:25.805
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.486
Okay. Please keep
them out of sight,
if you can help it.

22:37.560 --> 22:40.404
See? He ripped off
and repurposed our code.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.729
- What the hell is this?
- What?

22:47.800 --> 22:51.043
The agreement was an approval
and a presence for
his computer access.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.202
I approved it.
A DOJ approval.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.611
Now you're changing
the goalposts?

22:54.680 --> 22:56.284
<i>Hola, chica.</i>
You came to me.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.600
How am I supposed
to do my work?

22:57.680 --> 22:58.920
On an abacus
or something?

22:59.480 --> 23:01.050
<i>"Chica"?</i>
Am I Hispanic?

23:01.120 --> 23:02.884
What the hell's going on?

23:02.960 --> 23:04.689
I advocated
getting you over here.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.445
I pulled every string to get your
convicted felon sprung, Mr. Chen.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.284
"Captain" Chen.
And I didn't ask.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.442
I offered partnership,
an equivalent,

23:11.520 --> 23:12.646
or we would do it
on our own.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.928
Well, I'll be happy
to bust him back to Canaan

23:15.000 --> 23:17.321
and put your ass on the
first plane back to China.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.890
He apologizes.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.004
My brother misunderstood
our arrangement,
Special Agent.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.091
Look around.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.920
I have to run
the morning backup.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.366
Your network is sitting
behind deep packet inspection,

23:52.440 --> 23:54.442
intrusion protection.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.204
It's extensively
firewalled.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.129
Exactly.

23:58.200 --> 24:02.000
So somebody had to physically enter
this room and plug the virus in.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.447
We reviewed keycard
scans and surveillance tapes.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.010
There was no
unauthorized entry.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.242
Now, we're thinking about
a routing weakness.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.810
That's too complicated.
He wouldn't have done that.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.326
Yeah. Well,
what you're proposing
didn't happen.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.847
There's only one person who's
authorized to access these terminals.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.921
Me.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.367
And my password
is my thumbprint.

24:22.720 --> 24:23.767
May I?

24:27.520 --> 24:28.521
Sure.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.281
Can I have some
approval now?

24:56.240 --> 24:58.288
All right.
This is the code for our RAT.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.805
See, it's compact.
It's slick.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.723
Under a meg.
You would never
have picked up on it.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.326
Ever leave that
USB drive on your desk?

25:04.440 --> 25:05.441
I suppose so.

25:05.520 --> 25:08.603
Who works here
who doesn't like you?
Recently hired? Fired?

25:08.680 --> 25:09.727
No.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.081
Who?

25:12.520 --> 25:13.885
Lozano.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.883
His mother passed away.
He left two weeks ago.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.361
John Lozano.
He was only
on the job for a month.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.080
- He have access to your office?
- Yes.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.930
I'll pull his
employment records.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.770
Everything will
come up phony.

25:24.360 --> 25:27.011
Except this.
You got his photo ID?

25:28.600 --> 25:30.250
Yeah.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.802
This section of his code
right here is a mess.

25:33.880 --> 25:38.966
There's 25 lines,
he's left text.
It looks incomplete.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.804
Are they notes to himself?

25:40.880 --> 25:42.405
Dead-end ideas?

25:43.040 --> 25:44.565
Maybe he's still writing.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.641
Yeah, that's good.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.244
So if you've got the ability
to move a commodity

25:50.360 --> 25:51.885
any way you want,
what do you do?

25:51.960 --> 25:54.964
I play it out long and low-key.
I do not do one big spike.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.640
Instead, I'd play it
out month after month.
Less risk of detection.

25:57.880 --> 26:01.930
Yeah, right.
But our guy jacks soy
250% in a day.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.651
Mmm-hmm.
It's flashy. He knows
he's gonna bring down heat.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.603
Maybe he needs cash.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.011
Fast.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.765
He's got the money
from the soy run-up.

26:14.920 --> 26:18.242
And he's busy writing
code for what's next.

26:25.160 --> 26:27.845
I think the real hit
is still to come.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.440
We have Lozano's photo.

26:38.320 --> 26:39.970
What's on his neck?

26:40.040 --> 26:41.883
Kid had tattoos.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.003
You have any
routine surveillance tapes?

26:49.200 --> 26:50.201
Right there.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.850
Face of stone.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.324
<i>Pollack.</i>
It's me.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.927
Can you have someone
jump on the NCIC database?

27:07.360 --> 27:10.967
<i>Search for Latino males
under 30 with priors in,</i>

27:11.840 --> 27:14.047
<i>I don't know,
anything like carding,
identity theft,</i>

27:14.200 --> 27:17.090
who were in West Texas
prison gangs.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.449
Our cowboy has a tattoo
on his shoulder.
He's with Los Zapotecas.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.640
<i>I'm sending you
something right now.</i>

27:25.440 --> 27:28.284
That's him
in the bottom left.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.723
<i>Alonzo Reyes.
Did two years in
Huntsville for carding.</i>

27:33.800 --> 27:37.327
<i>Paroled. Moved back to LA.
I'll have LA pick him up.</i>

27:37.400 --> 27:40.290
He's gonna monitor
his home grid. I did.

27:40.360 --> 27:44.081
We got a better shot getting a
first look at him ourselves.

27:45.480 --> 27:46.840
Isn't that why
you brought me here?

27:48.040 --> 27:49.041
Okay?

27:49.360 --> 27:50.646
Yeah. Go ahead.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.843
That means you and
me are on the money.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.127
Unless you think you can
do that on your own, too.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.201
I do okay.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.321
You do, huh?

27:58.400 --> 28:01.404
Let's see how you handle
the financial sector.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.770
Thanks, Stanley.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.441
My eye's on you.

28:21.520 --> 28:22.851
Where do you think
I'm going?

28:22.920 --> 28:26.208
This guy is one step away from
my "get out of jail free" card.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.806
<i>So...</i>

28:45.320 --> 28:46.651
How can I help?

28:46.720 --> 28:48.085
We want to see
your trading records

28:48.160 --> 28:51.801
of your traders who took large
profits from the soy run-up.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.403
You're requesting
I turn over records

28:58.480 --> 29:00.209
to the FBI
and a foreign power

29:00.280 --> 29:03.329
on thousands of private
brokers and traders?

29:05.960 --> 29:08.008
Afraid I can't possibly
accommodate you.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.923
You're gonna protect the person
who manipulated your market?

29:10.080 --> 29:13.050
No. You're casting
your net way too wide,
Mr. Chen.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.167
You want to see my data,

29:14.240 --> 29:15.765
you come up with something
a little more tangible.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.922
Something more in the way
of probable cause

29:18.000 --> 29:19.206
than your hunch.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.169
Gary.
May I call you Gary?

29:23.480 --> 29:25.244
How's this for tangible?

29:25.720 --> 29:28.166
In the next 15 seconds
I call Laura Greer

29:28.240 --> 29:30.004
at the Commodities
Trading Commission.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.690
And I say,
"Laura, how you doing?

29:31.760 --> 29:35.401
"I'd like to launch an official
investigation on one Gary Baker."

29:35.480 --> 29:36.606
So the headline,

29:36.680 --> 29:41.811
"M-Tech Official Investigated for
Aiding and Abetting Cyber Criminals"

29:41.880 --> 29:44.087
leaks to CNN
in the next 90

29:44.160 --> 29:46.208
so it makes the three
o'clock news cycle,

29:46.280 --> 29:48.362
as well as
the nightly news.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.204
That'd be good, too.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.044
Am I being tangible?

29:56.960 --> 29:58.041
Gary?

30:04.000 --> 30:08.403
Look around here.
But I stay here with you.
No take nothing.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.001
<i>Hey, mi carnal?</i>

30:43.480 --> 30:45.289
What happened to you?

31:17.360 --> 31:21.570
He has WRT hardware
and an onion router.

31:22.160 --> 31:28.486
He can route encrypted data and
stay anonymous with no IP address.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.521
Yeah,
somebody must have
told him how to set it up.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.366
She probably called 911.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.451
Who's the woman?

32:04.720 --> 32:06.768
It's the manager.
Mrs. Novo.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.490
Here, let me see it.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.205
Here. Try it now.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.007
Barrett, this is Jessup.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.001
Mmm-hmm.
Thanks, Jessup.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.082
Well, we better make following
the money pay off,

32:33.160 --> 32:35.083
Reyes isn't. He's dead.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.565
Oh, great.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.280
Wait a minute.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.523
We've been looking
for buyers of soy.
Switch to sellers.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.887
Only our player would know
exactly when to get out.

32:55.920 --> 32:59.481
Reyes got an email
about a drop tonight.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.046
With no Reyes,
we gotta find a new link
to our main player.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.690
I'm gonna see who shows.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.568
You tell Jessup?

33:07.640 --> 33:09.688
No. They'll spot
him 10 blocks away.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.211
You get into not
enough for one day?

33:14.840 --> 33:16.251
Look,
I play it my way,
it works.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.607
It don't,
at least I own it.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.411
I go, too.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.284
You look not so different
from the pictures.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.644
What pictures?

34:01.800 --> 34:04.531
That my brother
sent me before.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.683
Why you're in prison?

35:05.240 --> 35:06.366
Hmm.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.921
I was in a bar,
I met some girl,

35:19.040 --> 35:20.690
and some guy got
in my face about her.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.649
He started a fight
and when it's over,

35:22.720 --> 35:24.484
he's in the hospital
and I'm arrested.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.650
I wound up sentenced to
18 months at MCI-Norfolk.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.882
I traded academia
for gladiator academy.

35:34.920 --> 35:36.763
Then what?

35:36.840 --> 35:37.966
Then I got out.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.041
I'm 22,

35:39.120 --> 35:41.487
and not a lot going
on in Silicon Valley

35:41.560 --> 35:43.688
for an ex-con with no degree.
So.

35:43.760 --> 35:44.921
Carding?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.810
Yeah, that and
I was in wholesaling internationally.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.121
I had an eight-year run,
then the Feeb caught up
with me.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.248
And I got 13 years.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.610
You have regrets?

35:56.680 --> 35:57.841
Regrets? No.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.809
The banks got hit for
the losses, not people.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.530
I didn't burn people.
I don't burn people.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.681
No.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.967
I mean, banks are chiseling
everybody all the time, anyway.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.326
I don't feel sorry
for banks, no.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.643
I mean, I'm sorry for
what happened to you.

36:09.760 --> 36:13.481
Don't be.
I'm not fishing for sympathy, here.

36:13.560 --> 36:16.928
I did the crime,
I'm doing the time.
Time isn't doing me.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.331
What's that mean?

36:19.400 --> 36:21.801
I do my own time,
not the institution's.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.325
See, to hold on to
who you are in there,

36:23.440 --> 36:25.488
you dedicate yourself
to your program.

36:25.560 --> 36:28.450
You work out on your
body and your mind.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.004
Open your eyes.

36:41.480 --> 36:42.845
What'd you say?

36:42.920 --> 36:45.969
You talk like you
are still in prison.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.090
But you're not in prison.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.400
Get your thinking
to where you are,
not where you've been.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.363
What do you know
about where I've been?

36:52.480 --> 36:53.480
No. Nothing.

36:53.520 --> 36:54.567
No, nothing.
But...

36:54.640 --> 36:57.211
Okay, tell me,
what is it I'm supposed
to start seeing so fast?

36:57.280 --> 36:58.280
Where you are.

36:58.360 --> 37:00.089
What, Koreatown?

37:01.280 --> 37:03.362
- This restaurant, this table?
- What?

37:04.680 --> 37:07.889
You'll be in the rapid
stream of decision-making.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.201
Having to make
intuitive choices.

37:10.280 --> 37:13.966
The people against you
are high-speed,
world-class dangers.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.930
To be genius coder
to outsmart, out-think

37:17.000 --> 37:19.082
like my brother
always said you could,

37:19.600 --> 37:22.080
you have to think
about it clear.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.968
Not easy, I know.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.771
There's no transition time.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.770
But I believe you
are a very strong man.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.251
Very smart man.

37:41.680 --> 37:42.681
Here, Chen.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.360
Three trades.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.890
Three different accounts.
Large volumes.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.485
They all sell within
minutes of each other.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.484
Just at the soft close,
at 13:13 and 13:14.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.164
Timed perfectly
when to dump.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.081
What's that?

37:55.160 --> 37:58.801
- Bank accounts. Foreign.
- Same place, all three.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.126
Where?

38:01.520 --> 38:03.010
Hong Kong.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.771
You want your bill?

38:07.840 --> 38:10.605
You not order more,
you give up table.

38:10.680 --> 38:13.206
You're really hurting
for space, huh?

38:17.600 --> 38:19.762
Maybe our guy
is no-show.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.970
What is it?

40:59.720 --> 41:00.721
Let's go.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.040
What's happening?

41:04.920 --> 41:06.410
Who are you?

41:07.560 --> 41:09.767
Why are you here?

41:09.840 --> 41:10.841
Who are you?

41:34.120 --> 41:35.121
Watch out!

41:40.920 --> 41:42.206
Ahhh!

41:55.600 --> 41:58.001
Hey, hey! Hey!

42:09.440 --> 42:12.091
<i>And Reyes
probably was killed.</i>

42:12.640 --> 42:14.563
<i>The email on his
computer was bait.</i>

42:14.640 --> 42:17.723
<i>Whoever this is wanted to see
if we were on Reyes' trail.</i>

42:17.800 --> 42:19.165
<i>We're burned.</i>

42:19.320 --> 42:21.084
Could you track it
to our guy's location?

42:21.600 --> 42:25.161
No, the video feed went through
a proxy server in the Ukraine.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.561
Who knows where
it bounces to off that?

42:27.720 --> 42:30.963
Yeah, and our players
are foreign, too.

42:31.120 --> 42:32.360
What about the money?

42:32.440 --> 42:34.442
<i>Three accounts,
all in the same place.</i>

42:34.520 --> 42:36.090
They took $74 million.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.288
We're going to
follow the money.

42:38.440 --> 42:39.771
<i>Where?</i>

42:39.840 --> 42:41.649
Put my sister on.

42:59.360 --> 43:02.045
We're flying
to China in the morning.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.004
<i>- My dad was a steel worker.
- Single father.</i>

44:58.080 --> 44:59.969
<i>He raised us on his own.</i>

45:00.040 --> 45:02.281
<i>Came to visit, twice.</i>

45:02.440 --> 45:04.124
<i>Then he got sick.</i>

45:04.800 --> 45:06.802
I used to replay memories

45:07.480 --> 45:10.609
so I could stay oriented
for when I got out.

46:27.480 --> 46:28.811
Captain Chen?

46:28.880 --> 46:31.087
Paul Wang, CNCERT.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.207
In here.

46:32.280 --> 46:33.850
What's the status?

46:34.680 --> 46:37.729
We're trying to restore
coolant by pumping in sea water.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.404
I got more injured.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.486
Since it happened,

46:44.960 --> 46:46.530
was there any
demand for money?

46:46.600 --> 46:47.601
No.

46:48.360 --> 46:49.566
Then it's not
about extortion.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.122
Is he political?
A terrorist attack?
Any declaration?

46:53.200 --> 46:54.884
No claim. No statement.

46:55.080 --> 46:56.730
What does this guy want?

46:59.400 --> 47:00.686
What did
the malware attack?

47:00.760 --> 47:03.491
Programmable Launch
Controllers. PLCs.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.608
They tell the pumps
to turn on, turn off,

47:05.680 --> 47:06.841
to cool the reactor.

47:06.920 --> 47:09.366
Any idea where
the attack originated?

47:09.440 --> 47:11.480
I was tracking the
malware when the core went.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.125
We had to evacuate.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.884
But if a machine failed,

47:15.960 --> 47:18.611
it should have saved the
memory to a diagnostic file.

47:18.680 --> 47:21.524
Yeah, that's right.
And in that memory dump
may be your traces of code.

47:21.600 --> 47:23.568
Maybe even this
guy's real IP address.

47:23.640 --> 47:26.007
But those servers are
in the control room.
Everything is still hot.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.491
We're fighting
a meltdown.

48:20.640 --> 48:21.641
Chen Lien.

48:22.120 --> 48:24.600
Inspector Alex Trang,
Hong Kong Police.

48:25.840 --> 48:28.366
Hathaway,
US Marshal Mark Jessup.

48:28.440 --> 48:29.601
Hello.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.325
So, is this them?

48:35.120 --> 48:36.120
These the guys?

48:36.160 --> 48:37.400
Yeah.

48:37.480 --> 48:39.005
We got anything?

48:40.760 --> 48:41.966
Here they are.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.605
Johnny Li,
Yan Lin, Samuel Wu.

48:46.080 --> 48:48.082
Li just got out of
prison two months ago.

48:48.160 --> 48:50.322
Yan and his mother
are both junkies.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.845
Wu runs a chop shop.

48:52.360 --> 48:54.010
Hardly commodities
speculators.

48:55.240 --> 48:57.242
They're fronts?
Proxies?

49:04.080 --> 49:05.286
So how do they communicate?

49:05.360 --> 49:07.044
How do they connect up
to our actor?

49:07.120 --> 49:08.167
They don't.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.049
Phones,
the Internet.

49:10.120 --> 49:12.202
And we've been on them
all day and all night.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.281
Nothing.

49:14.520 --> 49:16.682
If you were our player,
right now,

49:16.760 --> 49:18.125
what would be
your next move?

49:18.200 --> 49:19.884
I'd make my trail go cold.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.405
How?
I'd cash out.

49:21.520 --> 49:22.931
Cash money doesn't
leave a trail.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.162
Pick it up.
Walk it anywhere you want.

49:25.240 --> 49:27.049
But the money
hasn't moved yet.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.327
There's no activity
in the accounts.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.565
Yeah,
this is all too clean.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.449
I mean, there's got to be
somebody between them,

49:36.520 --> 49:38.841
talking to them,
instructing them,
telling them what to do.

49:38.920 --> 49:41.161
There has to be
someone in contact.

49:41.240 --> 49:43.288
It wouldn't be
the main player.
Too much exposure.

49:43.360 --> 49:44.361
A middle man?

49:47.200 --> 49:49.168
They didn't all fall by
here by accident either.

49:49.240 --> 49:50.480
Where?

49:50.560 --> 49:51.686
Can I see this?

50:03.120 --> 50:05.248
Right there.
Where's this?

50:06.920 --> 50:08.285
Yau Ma Tei.

50:22.760 --> 50:23.966
Great.

50:50.160 --> 50:51.207
OCTB.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.441
We're running
a surveillance.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.045
On whom?

50:54.120 --> 50:56.487
Some Lebanese guy on our
trafficker watch list.

50:57.320 --> 50:58.481
Why'd you let him in?

50:59.200 --> 51:01.248
Well, they want to see if he's
talking to anybody homegrown.

51:01.320 --> 51:02.651
Why here?

51:03.480 --> 51:05.801
Every morning he comes
here to meet someone.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.210
Run him down.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.041
Hmm.

51:17.160 --> 51:18.844
Elias Kassar.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.049
Fought with
the Christian Phalangists

51:21.120 --> 51:23.009
in the Civil War,
then disappeared.

51:23.240 --> 51:27.529
Popped up in the '90s with the
paramilitaries in Colombia.

51:27.680 --> 51:30.365
Renting a house
month-to-month in Shek O.

51:30.560 --> 51:31.686
Who's he meet?

51:32.400 --> 51:33.765
No one.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.171
No one ever shows.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.570
He texts.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.443
Is your phone an Android?

52:37.720 --> 52:39.563
Can I see it?

53:16.960 --> 53:18.325
Trang.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.170
Bluetooth transmitter.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.402
Short range.
We would never pick it up.

53:52.800 --> 53:55.000
See, they don't
come to meet him.
They come to meet this.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.281
Kassar texts,

53:57.360 --> 53:58.964
Wu, Yan and Li walk by.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.849
The receivers in
their pockets pick it up.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.525
They read it, delete it.

54:02.680 --> 54:04.489
Kassar never meets them,
never sees them.

54:04.560 --> 54:06.881
No emails.
No phones. No nothing.

54:07.240 --> 54:08.241
Slick.

54:08.680 --> 54:09.841
Can you crack it?

54:09.920 --> 54:11.081
In about a month.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.924
See, it's locked
in GPG encryption.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.241
So, at least a 512-bit key.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.200
We pick him up,
lean all over him.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.726
Or we let him ride and tail
him to the main player.

54:20.800 --> 54:21.880
Ah, you don't
have a choice.

54:22.120 --> 54:24.521
I mean, this guy's history.
He ain't gonna roll.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.202
I think we let him ride.

54:35.520 --> 54:36.806
Yeah.

54:36.880 --> 54:38.769
Sunrise is in two hours.

55:04.160 --> 55:06.003
When this is over,

55:07.400 --> 55:08.447
what will you do?

55:11.920 --> 55:15.561
I don't know. Fix TVs,
garage door openers.

55:16.760 --> 55:20.082
Are you still gonna like me if
I'm fixing garage door openers?

55:23.240 --> 55:25.083
I don't know.
Maybe.

57:01.840 --> 57:03.320
They're moving the money.

57:08.760 --> 57:10.808
All three accounts.

57:20.120 --> 57:22.361
Wire transfers
to a Macau casino.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.246
They're cashing out.

57:24.320 --> 57:25.765
Surveillance?
Nobody's moved.

57:25.840 --> 57:26.887
Kassar?

57:26.960 --> 57:28.360
We can't reach
Yan's team in Shek O.

57:28.560 --> 57:31.166
We're going to Shek O.
We're going to Shek O
to pick up Kassar.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.720
Launch STU.
Meet at the heliport.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.609
I'm going to
pick up the mules.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.764
<i>Let's talk about this.</i>

58:34.280 --> 58:35.361
<i>I'm not blind.</i>

58:35.440 --> 58:37.204
<i>I know the two of
you are together.</i>

58:37.280 --> 58:39.760
<i>But look at it through my
eyes and what do you see?</i>

58:42.160 --> 58:45.323
<i>"Hathaway. Been in prison.
Damaged goods.</i>

58:45.400 --> 58:47.243
<i>"Not much to offer
my sister,</i>

58:47.760 --> 58:51.048
<i>"and his future's not
exactly guaranteed,"
is what I'd see.</i>

58:52.120 --> 58:53.610
<i>What else?</i>

58:54.440 --> 58:56.841
<i>"She deserves better,"
I'd think, if I was Chen.</i>

58:59.120 --> 59:01.487
<i>I've rarely
seen her happier.</i>

59:02.440 --> 59:04.124
<i>But what if this fails?</i>

59:04.840 --> 59:07.844
<i>Nine more years in prison.
What kind of life
is that for her?</i>

59:20.160 --> 59:21.400
<i>Chen, it's Barrett.</i>

59:21.640 --> 59:22.640
I hear you.

59:22.680 --> 59:24.967
<i>The mules.
We've got Li and Yan.</i>

59:25.520 --> 59:28.410
And listen,
we can't reach
surveillance in Shek O.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.800
Come on. This way.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.241
Trang!

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.443
Hold on, man! Hold on!

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.131
Stay down!

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.921
Go! Go!

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.966
Come on.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.442
Elias!
Elias, you coming?

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.569
Come on! Come on!

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.521
Don't wait!
Drive the barge out of here!

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.686
Wai.
<i>It's Paul Wang.</i>

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.922
<i>We were able to restore the
water above the fuel rods</i>

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.331
<i>and stabilize the reactor.</i>

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.004
<i>It's still hot,
but we can get in.</i>

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.365
Nick! Mark!

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.768
I still don't get it.
What's he after?

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.080
And Why this?

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.689
Hey, what'd she say?

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.091
Move fast.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.770
Wang!

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.121
- Wang!
- Hey!

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.728
Take him!
Both of you,
get out of here!

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.491
Hathaway...

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.646
We were right.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:09.247
In the memory dump are the
fragments of the malware.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.049
But it's corrupted.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.841
Maybe his IP address,
but it's too full of holes.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.688
You know, when the Feeb team
busted me in '07 and hit my door,

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.683
I was flushing files.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.000
But when I came to trial,

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.880
they retrieved all this data that
should have been irretrievable.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.161
Black Widow.
It's NSA software.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.165
Examines fragments
and reconstructs originals

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.561
within a couple of
hours of supercomputing.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.807
Big cases like yours,
they loan it to us.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.410
<i>Rich, I need access
to Black Widow.</i>

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.723
Sharing classified
tech with the Chinese?
Are you kidding?

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.484
That's not even getting
into Hathaway using it.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.166
<i>We've committed to
full cooperation, Rich.</i>

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.402
Yeah, well, you're Justice.
We're NSA.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.484
If I wanted to, I can't.
And I don't want to.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.004
An unequivocal "No."

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.281
Okay, so how's it work?
You give NSA the data,
they run it, what?

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.489
No, they have
a remote login.
We run it.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.005
You're not thinking.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.367
Come on. They got
the keys to the kingdom.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.771
Our guy's address, maybe.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:51.969
Whatever he's cooking up
next is right in there.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.963
Only, we can't read it.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.846
Let's go.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.611
My old correspondence
with Donahue is here.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.967
But there's no way that
login is still active.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.883
I'm not gonna
use that login.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.401
Okay, Donahue,
the NSA contact you
were just talking with.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.245
If NSA discovers
the intrusion...

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.810
You sure you want
to do this?

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.962
FBI can't explain
after the fact?

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.604
You locate this guy,
you're okay.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.326
You get discovered,
you're dead meat.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.202
You know that,
don't you?

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.450
The NSA guy
you were talking to,

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.363
what's his
supervisor's name?

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.645
Ben Hitchens.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.448
Maybe it's better
if the two of you and you

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.966
aren't around for the next part
so you can deny being here.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.121
How do you feel
about this?

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.201
Not good.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.363
It's worse for
the guy in there.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.363
I'm surprised
you went along.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.761
Washington didn't
see Chai Wan.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.761
<i>You asked him
to change his password?</i>

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.920
When he downloaded
the PDF...

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.600
...what he downloaded
was the keylogger.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.206
Got it.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.330
Now, we wait.

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.446
We're in.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.568
You can call me
"chica" any time you want.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.804
This is our actor's
home IP address.
His home server.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:25.282
He's not in Mumbai,
not in Minneapolis, not in Riga.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.725
He is in Jakarta.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.926
Can you crack the site?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.047
No.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.203
Intrarmour's a hosting company
like a hotel or a Swiss bank,

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.727
exclusively for
black hat hackers,
so it's bulletproof.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.485
His server's in there,
but we can't crack the site.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.320
All right. So, the move
is strictly low tech.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.361
As in...

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.928
Go to Jakarta,
burglarize the place,

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.809
get our hands
on his server.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.804
We don't have visas or badges
that work in Indonesia.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.564
Can't FBI
get us documented?

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.405
After the NSA turndown,
I'd stay away from D.C.

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.403
Then I'll work my side
of the house for entry.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.290
That'll take a face-to-face
with my bosses.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.089
- All right.
- All right.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.251
You getting anywhere?

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.687
No.
Not into the servers.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.882
But I got into
lntrarmour's accounting.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.041
Look at this.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.691
Charges to our boy's account.
Okay, so?

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.441
Mmm.
Look at this. $14, $17.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.522
Now, $16,400.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.247
Five times.
Paid to SatelliteShot.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.561
SatelliteShot
rents satellite time.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.244
What kind of shot?
This kind.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.120
Hi-res scan.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.804
Of the coast of Malaysia.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.881
What's there?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.490
Nothing much.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.369
Why'd he scan there?

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.401
Shit!

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.441
This is Barrett.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.564
<i>What the hell did you
let go on there, Carol?</i>

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:06.680
Pollack?

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.768
<i>Do you know
what your guy did?</i>

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:09.920
What are you talking about?

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.960
<i>Cut the crap.</i>

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.924
I'm talking about calls
I got from the goddamn
NSA and Defense.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.765
Our guy blew
a reactor at Chai Wan.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:17.841
Don't you watch CNN?

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.610
That's not the point.

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.927
<i>That's not the point.</i>

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.168
That's exactly the point.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.208
The guy we're working
will drop the big hammer

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.441
and not think twice
about it.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.921
Come on, come on, come on.
Don't evoke 9/11 on me.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.200
You didn't lose
anyone there, Stanley.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.925
Look, I'm under orders.
Now, so are you.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.401
Bring him in, Carol.
Bring him in.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.250
What's going on?

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.251
Damn it! Hathaway's gone.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.970
Hey. This says he's here.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.771
He cut his bracelet?

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.126
He can't.
It signals an alarm.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.401
This says it's working.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.561
Check your settings.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.489
He reset it to
once every 24 hours.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.002
We haven't been
tracking him since LA.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.081
They're at
Cheung Hau Street.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.286
Shit.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:21.921
Hey.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.731
They're coming for you.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.329
They're coming for you
because of Black Widow.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.890
That was fast.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.043
They want me to turn you
over to the Americans.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.529
So, turn me in
and walk away.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.728
And then,
Barrett and Jessup will back me up.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.086
NSA won't care.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.448
They think because of you,
now we have Black Widow.

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.529
You have to run.

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.805
What? You're gonna
refuse an order?

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.485
You escaped.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.729
We reconnect in Jakarta.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.723
Look, your bosses
can add two and two.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.131
I'm not turning you in.

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.122
Do I go with you or Nick?

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.240
Neither.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.288
- What?
- This doesn't involve you.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.727
Who made that choice?

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:20.847
He's right.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:29.009
Look, I'm not sure there's any light
at the end of this tunnel anymore.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.565
What did you do,
Chen Dawai?

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.722
Remind him
he owes you?

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.968
To get him
to leave me behind?

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.564
You're not going
down that road.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.842
I decide what's for me!

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.970
Yeah, well, I decide
what's for me.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.929
I'm going. You're not.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.607
Right now,
we need our data.

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.365
Here.
You take the car.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:07.125
You may have to move faster.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:09.885
I'll bring the hard drive
to Quarry Bay.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.449
He's in Kowloon.
Right here.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.246
You're gonna take
him into custody?

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.006
I follow orders.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.320
Which orders?

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:28.051
Stop the bad guys,
or arrest Hathaway?

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.204
I'm gonna ask you
a personal question.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.284
Don't answer if
you don't want to.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.289
Who did you lose in 9/11?

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.970
My husband.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.522
You got to get rid
of that thing.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.602
We got a couple of hours.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.961
Hold it. Hold it.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.128
He's on the move again.
He's in Hong Kong.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.281
Quarry Bay.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.971
Where?
He's headed toward Quarry Bay.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.481
I thought you were
going separately.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.130
Nick's taking
a small plane.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.725
I'm flying commercial.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.404
Sister, go home.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.810
You did this.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.685
All right, let's go.

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.445
Lien!

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.045
Hold up! Stop.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.120
What?
Hold up. Hold up!

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.161
What?
Stop.

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.361
What?
Listen!

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.204
I'm a fugitive now!

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.326
They'll issue
the warrant within hours!

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.326
Hey.

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.601
Would I take you
where I'm going?

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.762
Don't blame your brother.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.250
No!

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.010
Go, go, go!

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:55.880
Barrett!

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.845
Lien, can they get
to the next stop

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.331
before the train?

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.084
Listen, we gotta
grieve later, okay?

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.161
We have to survive.

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:45.323
Can they get to the next
stop before the train?

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.289
No, they can't.

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.651
Okay, Okay.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.204
We're both
going after them!

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.930
We're both going.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.851
Yes, we are.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:06.761
We are.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.724
Perak, Malaysia.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:20.168
Coordinates
are right here.

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.805
Here. Right here.
Looked at this.

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.600
He's got $74 million
in cash, he's writing code.

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:34.920
What for?

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.527
What's here?

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.000
You got Dean Palm Oil,
Pera Limited Mining.

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.962
Agriculture... Jesus.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:36.042
Hey, this pump,
it's a Stasik pump.

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:49.165
They use
the same model

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.890
Stasik water pumps
as Chai Wan reactor.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.205
The same brand.
Are they controlled
by the same PLCs?

01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.681
Yes.

01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.125
What are they
mining over there?

01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.880
Pera Limited.

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.682
Mining tin.
Tin?

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.444
Malaysia is one of
the biggest exporters.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.891
And there's four other tin mining
operations in the next valley.

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.887
This is a riverbed.

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:18.486
They divert water
with Stasik pumps.

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:22.647
You know why
Chai Wan reactor?

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.563
We've been looking through the
looking glass the wrong way.

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.086
He didn't target the reactor
to knock out the reactor.

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.288
He targeted it to
knock out the pumps.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.081
He was rehearsing.
It was a rehearsal.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.602
Chai Wan was a rehearsal.

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.371
He's going to shut down these
pumps and flood the tin mine,

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.090
and the valleys,
and the villages,

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:43.083
village people,
village dogs.

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:46.846
Create a shortage in tin.
Tin prices will rise and shoot up.

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.206
His $74 million from Chicago
was to buy options on tin ore.

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.846
That's what you're doing.
Isn't it, you son of a bitch?

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.606
All right,
look at this.

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.645
A third version
of his virus, running more PLCs.

01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.245
Fifty-three...

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.203
Fifty-three PLCs.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.766
Five different tin mines.

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.043
For which he's going to
flood five river valleys.

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.524
Here's the money
from Chicago.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:16.163
$73.6 million
in cash,

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.890
deposited into
a local bank.

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:20.122
Bank Sentra Agatis.

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.404
To this address.

01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:45.121
Hi.
Hello.

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.964
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Can you speak English?

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.451
A little.
Okay.

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.204
I'm here to have
a meeting with

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.130
Mr. Jumhari in five minutes.

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.809
Go to the reception
on the third floor.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:58.729
Yeah, I know, but

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.770
can you help me?
My presentation got stained.

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.442
Any chance,
can you print me a new copy,
please?

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.090
Not supposed to, but...

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.645
So?

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.051
Home run.

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:57.048
<i>You got my message.</i>

01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.567
Why are you here?
You tell me, what do you want?

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.405
I am not gonna talk
to a fucking bagman.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.563
Here's the terms.
Phones only. No face-to-face.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.051
<i>You got that? Good.</i>

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:10.964
<i>Next, your boss on
the line with me in 15.</i>

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:15.926
That's not possible.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:18.649
I have $74 million
of his money.

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.324
You make it possible.

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:48.966
Yeah.

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:52.487
Your note said
that you know me,
but I don't know you.

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.131
But that's not really true,
is it, Hathaway?

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:58.090
<i>Yeah? I know you.</i>

01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.400
Ah, you do?

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.566
<i>Well, that makes one of us.</i>

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:03.960
<i>Sometimes I wake
up in the morning</i>

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.206
<i>and I don't
even know who I am.</i>

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:07.966
Where I am. In what country.

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:12.611
<i>And you know me?</i>

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:13.806
I know you,

01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.211
<i>and you're about money</i>

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:17.965
<i>because it's your scoreboard
in the virtual world.</i>

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:19.530
You found me.

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.761
What do you want?

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.884
I want to be
Casper the Ghost.

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.250
Don't you have a job,
working yourself out of prison?

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.924
<i>It was kind of a bad fit.</i>

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.203
<i>You're looking
for employment?</i>

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:33.805
What do I want
employment for?

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:36.167
<i>Oh, you want a piece?</i>

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:39.369
To put yourself
back into the game?

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:40.771
You were never
in the game.

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:42.365
You're a glorified carder.

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.805
A carder whose
time is expired.

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:46.167
Check your expiration date.
Your shelf life is over.

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:48.971
A glorified carder
holding your $74 million.

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:52.044
Okay, last time.
What do you want?

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:54.851
I want 20% of
the Malaysian tin ore hit.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.210
<i>For releasing my money?</i>

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.770
No, for renting you my code.

01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:05.764
It's my action that gave
that code you wrote meaning.

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:08.241
What's it mean
without a bankroll?

01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:14.161
You want to be my partner?

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:17.847
<i>It's 20%. You call
it whatever you want.</i>

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:19.126
I meet my partners.

01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:24.766
Well, I don't.

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:27.081
And like I told your bagman,
I don't want to meet.

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:29.931
<i>I don't give a fuck
about what you want.</i>

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:34.601
It's what I want
when I make a deal,
face-to-face.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.927
Because I can put
together another bankroll.
Target another target.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.048
And if I stop thinking
about you,

01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:46.168
if I stop thinking
about anything,

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:51.121
it disappears. It vanishes.
It ceases to exist.

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.409
But you...

01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.522
You, I want to meet.

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:02.206
Or you can piss off
and die, Ghostman.

01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:10.886
All right, you and Kassar.

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:13.561
<i>I'll call you
and tell you where.</i>

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:14.880
Sure.

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.090
Okay. We're on.

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.844
Emergency! Please.

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:51.722
It's all about if I can get
close enough fast enough.

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:36.644
<i>Hey, I told you.
You and Kassar, alone.</i>

01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:41.724
Five men,
two floors below.

01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:45.328
<i>The team
two floors below.</i>

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.449
And two gunmen
with them.

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.568
<i>And the two guys
with you?</i>

01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:54.491
<i>Lose them.
I'm changing the location.</i>

01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:00.406
<i>You and Kassar,
Papua Square. Walk west.
Meet me in two hours.</i>

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:03.290
It'll be packed.
How am I supposed to find you?

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.169
<i>I find you.</i>

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.005
Step back. Hands up.

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.844
Hands up, hands up.

01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:06.769
Hands up. Turn around.

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.851
Turn around!

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:25.005
No one's ever gotten
this close before.

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:26.806
20% is too much, Hathaway.

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.484
You talking points?

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:31.964
Well, people die on
this planet every day.

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:35.331
What do you want me to do?
Grieve? Because I knew him?

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.687
He's not here anymore.

01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.046
Where's my money?

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.770
Not about money.

01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:48.209
Not about zeroes
or ones or code.

01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:49.486
And what's that tell you?

01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:51.005
Get out of the way!

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:52.690
I'm a gamer.

01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:55.206
I hire people to do
sub-symbolic stuff.

01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:57.726
You killed my friends.
I do my own.

01:59:57.800 --> 01:59:59.006
And do I care?

02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:14.127
The Betadine.

02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:16.721
Here.

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.209
I got it.
Okay.

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:38.924
This one?
Yeah.

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:41.445
That's good. It's good.

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:43.520
Okay.
