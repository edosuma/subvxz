WEBVTT

00:06.438 --> 00:08.816
They're all dead together.

00:08.817 --> 00:11.817
They know who I am.

00:12.463 --> 00:14.366
I don't know what the hell that was.

00:14.367 --> 00:17.731
It floated around the pool table.

00:17.732 --> 00:20.064
Apparitions here follow us home.

00:20.065 --> 00:23.741
- The ground is cursed.
- It's like a little pit of hell.

00:23.742 --> 00:25.806
A child hasn't got a chance.

00:25.807 --> 00:27.212
Something grabbed my elbow.

00:27.213 --> 00:30.056
I could feel his hands around my neck.

00:30.057 --> 00:33.237
He is very pissed off.

00:34.685 --> 00:36.671
There's something down there.

00:36.672 --> 00:39.792
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.587 --> 00:42.828
A lot of dead people are here.

00:42.829 --> 00:45.597
I see dead people. This is not good.

00:45.598 --> 00:47.813
I speak to dead people..

00:47.814 --> 00:49.435
He is very pissed off.

00:49.436 --> 00:52.294
And they speak to me..
The house is angry.

00:52.295 --> 00:55.843
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:55.844 --> 00:57.609
He's killed people.

00:57.610 --> 00:59.066
I rely on my partner.

00:59.067 --> 01:02.509
I'm Steve Dischiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective..

01:02.510 --> 01:03.939
He got shot at his house?

01:03.940 --> 01:06.926
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.927 --> 01:08.320
Aren't you terrified being here?

01:08.321 --> 01:09.670
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.671 --> 01:11.838
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

01:11.839 --> 01:13.845
But Steve and I never speak..

01:13.846 --> 01:15.722
We never communicate
during an investigation..

01:15.723 --> 01:17.129
Until the very end.

01:17.130 --> 01:18.442
It's bad.

01:18.443 --> 01:20.534
And we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:20.535 --> 01:21.934
I'd like some answers.

01:21.935 --> 01:24.935
Or time to get out.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.195 --> 01:57.864
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

01:57.865 --> 02:00.541
I interview the witnesses,
gather the facts,

02:00.542 --> 02:03.392
and sort through the
history of each location.

02:03.393 --> 02:09.293
At the end we come together to see if
there's any correlation with our findings.

02:09.573 --> 02:15.473
I'm just outside of Salt Lake City,
Utah, in a small town called Santaquin.

02:16.515 --> 02:21.304
Leslie owns and operates
Leslie's family tree restaurant.

02:21.305 --> 02:23.887
She and her employees
apparently are seeing apparitions

02:28.291 --> 02:34.111
so I'm hoping our investigation
will give her some answers.

02:35.071 --> 02:40.411
Throughout the day I've
been having strange feelings.

02:40.646 --> 02:42.446
I..

02:42.733 --> 02:48.633
Was feeling, like, this insanity,
like.. Like murderous intentions.

02:57.864 --> 03:00.933
Before Amy can do her walk,
I need to clear the location

03:00.934 --> 03:05.914
of anything that can
influence her investigation.

03:07.443 --> 03:09.345
This place is especially difficult

03:09.346 --> 03:15.106
because its walls are covered
with old personal photographs.

03:33.720 --> 03:39.620
People can leave behind a wake of residual
energy that can last for centuries,

03:40.820 --> 03:43.537
which is why it's crucial
for me to take my time

03:43.538 --> 03:46.511
and try to connect with the
location at the beginning of the walk

03:46.512 --> 03:49.932
so I don't miss anything.

03:52.694 --> 03:55.754
The ground is cursed.

03:56.517 --> 03:59.397
It is.. Holy land.

04:03.293 --> 04:07.901
So something's gonna
happen in this place..

04:07.902 --> 04:11.322
Which probably isn't good.

04:37.057 --> 04:37.966
Steve.

04:37.967 --> 04:41.807
Leslie. Good to finally see you.

04:44.274 --> 04:47.136
Uh, you sounded very
worried when we spoke.

04:47.137 --> 04:48.378
I have been.

04:48.379 --> 04:52.242
Lately we've been doing quite a bit of
remodeling and different things up here,

04:52.243 --> 04:55.329
and the activity has
just gotten more and more.

04:55.330 --> 05:00.023
We have a lot of really weird
electrical problems going on.

05:00.024 --> 05:03.487
We have appliances that
will turn on and off.

05:03.488 --> 05:07.031
We have clocks that run backwards.

05:07.032 --> 05:12.932
And sometimes the power in the whole
building will go out for no reason.

05:23.098 --> 05:26.158
I'm seeing this guy.

05:26.805 --> 05:29.985
This person is really..

05:30.305 --> 05:32.645
Unhappy about this structure.

05:32.646 --> 05:34.859
They're unhappy about the location.

05:34.860 --> 05:40.760
I think they're gon.. They're
gonna do something relatively soon.

05:41.515 --> 05:47.275
Uh, he's pretty good with,
uh, things that are electrical.

05:49.837 --> 05:52.475
He's saying, like, "how many times"

05:52.476 --> 05:56.502
"does something have to happen
before people freaking, like, get it?"

05:56.503 --> 05:59.623
He's, uh, got issues.

06:04.262 --> 06:06.792
Now how long do you have this place?

06:06.793 --> 06:08.617
I've owned it for six years.

06:08.618 --> 06:13.718
And before that my Mother
owned it for 20 years.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.525
It was a dance hall.

06:15.526 --> 06:18.303
It was the old post office years ago.

06:18.304 --> 06:21.925
It was a place where kids
would come in and play games,

06:21.926 --> 06:25.286
machines, stuff like that.

06:27.481 --> 06:29.993
What's so urgent now
that you need our help?

06:29.994 --> 06:34.343
Well, I possibly could be
getting ready to retire,

06:34.344 --> 06:37.252
and I'm worried about
my daughter working here

06:37.253 --> 06:41.160
and even maybe her
children in the long run.

06:41.161 --> 06:45.421
I'm very concerned about their safety.

06:46.491 --> 06:49.199
Change, change, cha..

06:49.200 --> 06:52.080
Like a constantly..

06:52.198 --> 06:55.378
Uh, transitioning space.

06:56.586 --> 06:58.937
Whatever is here..

06:58.938 --> 07:02.210
Has an idea of what it should be..

07:02.211 --> 07:05.811
And it's not been that yet.

07:06.570 --> 07:09.570
So that's not good.

07:17.390 --> 07:20.496
Back in here was the dance floor.

07:20.497 --> 07:24.012
About six years ago we
started renovating this,

07:24.013 --> 07:26.921
and it's gotten very, very active.

07:26.922 --> 07:30.883
We hear kids back here
playing, laughing all the time.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.617
In fact, I've even seen
a young man back here.

07:33.618 --> 07:36.318
- Really?
- Yep.

07:37.805 --> 07:43.705
Only lasted for a couple of
seconds, but I did see the profile.

07:49.062 --> 07:52.302
There's some kids even.

07:54.518 --> 07:56.975
Are you interacting with
them or just observing them?

07:56.976 --> 08:02.076
They're staring at me,
and I'm staring at them.

08:03.534 --> 08:05.392
I think they're getting orders.

08:05.393 --> 08:08.543
I don't know who this guy, Henry..

08:08.544 --> 08:11.325
- To do what?
- To.. That they're not allowed to talk.

08:11.326 --> 08:17.226
Like, they're not allowed to
hang out, because he's pissed off.

08:18.507 --> 08:21.687
He is very pissed off.

08:29.823 --> 08:32.383
- What is this?
- This is a..

08:32.384 --> 08:36.477
Trapdoor that leads to
our basement downstairs.

08:36.479 --> 08:37.866
Nobody ever goes down there.

08:37.866 --> 08:40.927
It's just too scary.

08:41.101 --> 08:43.846
I'd like to go down, if that's okay.

08:43.847 --> 08:46.727
Oh, okay, you'll..

08:46.879 --> 08:51.799
You better go first,
because I don't like it.

08:57.383 --> 09:00.024
This is not making me
feel good. This is..

09:00.025 --> 09:02.235
All right. It's okay.

09:02.236 --> 09:06.976
I've been in a lot
worse places, trust me.

09:09.313 --> 09:11.773
There we go.

09:11.909 --> 09:14.178
Now, Leslie, you said that you
have a weird feeling down here.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.446
What's going on?

09:15.447 --> 09:18.223
I've heard voices.

09:18.224 --> 09:23.124
When I have had to come down here, I
just feel like somebody is watching me.

09:23.125 --> 09:26.043
- Like you're not alone?
- Exactly. Like I'm not alone.

09:26.044 --> 09:27.964
Okay.

09:29.127 --> 09:30.379
You know it was a saloon upstairs.

09:30.380 --> 09:33.186
Do you know if anything
would have happened down here?

09:33.187 --> 09:37.283
Well, it used to be a boxing ring where
the locals would come down and box..

09:37.284 --> 09:38.954
- Okay.
- About 40 years ago.

09:38.955 --> 09:44.295
And after that it was also
an illegal gambling hall.

09:48.082 --> 09:49.762
♪♪

09:50.793 --> 09:54.110
People would spend money..

09:54.111 --> 09:56.931
And have a party.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.326
Things were good.

09:59.327 --> 10:01.021
What sort of stuff did they do?

10:01.022 --> 10:05.527
- Just, you know, spend money and stuff.
- On what?

10:05.528 --> 10:08.768
- Hmm, gambling.
- Okay.

10:09.532 --> 10:13.252
But now everybody's all angry.

10:14.955 --> 10:18.855
It's like a little pit of hell.

10:40.065 --> 10:42.825
Good times again.

10:43.064 --> 10:48.344
Things were very good when
people would spend money.

10:52.047 --> 10:57.947
But now everybody's all angry, because
they cannot do what they want to do.

11:00.013 --> 11:04.021
I'm sensing a very hostile
presence in the basement.

11:04.022 --> 11:09.059
Whatever is here is sending me a very
strong message that it wants me gone.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.606
I gotta get away from this guy.

11:11.607 --> 11:14.667
He is full of anger.

11:25.953 --> 11:29.228
Crissa uh, I understand you've been
working here for about six months.

11:29.229 --> 11:32.371
- You've had a couple of things go on.
- Yeah.

11:32.372 --> 11:36.095
Not long after I started here, it
felt like something grabbed my elbow.

11:36.096 --> 11:41.996
It really made me uncomfortable
that something had touched me.

11:43.218 --> 11:44.477
What else? Anything else?

11:44.478 --> 11:48.213
I've had my little girl here,
and she was walking around one day

11:48.214 --> 11:53.734
and started talking, saying
that there were ghosts here.

11:54.087 --> 11:59.479
It really shocked me, and I got worried
about having her here all the time.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.187
Crissa, has she ever
mentioned that there were kids

12:02.188 --> 12:04.129
she were talking to
or anything like that?

12:04.130 --> 12:06.609
She did kind of say
something about a little boy,

12:06.610 --> 12:10.703
but she changed the topic really fast.

12:10.704 --> 12:12.391
Anything else?

12:12.392 --> 12:18.092
I saw an old man sitting at
that table right over there.

12:20.466 --> 12:22.253
But I thought it was an
honest-to-goodness person

12:22.254 --> 12:24.163
sitting there, so I
went through the doors,

12:24.164 --> 12:29.204
and as soon as I could
see again, he was gone.

12:32.488 --> 12:35.339
One of our tasks is to dust
the pictures on the walls.

12:35.340 --> 12:40.260
And that picture right
there.. I saw that guy.

12:41.855 --> 12:44.675
I know it's him.

12:48.150 --> 12:51.324
He used to come here.
When he was alive..

12:51.325 --> 12:53.365
A lot.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.685
I think he thinks, like,
we're gonna kick him out.

12:59.686 --> 13:02.599
Like, he's saying,
"this is mine. Get out.."

13:02.600 --> 13:06.626
"Or I'm gonna screw
your world and life up."

13:06.627 --> 13:08.795
Like, he doesn't care
if he hurts somebody.

13:08.796 --> 13:13.836
He doesn't care if he
kills.. He doesn't care.

13:14.242 --> 13:16.014
He doesn't have a conscience.

13:16.015 --> 13:20.335
So he's the perfect guy for this job.

13:21.551 --> 13:25.571
He's, like, really nuts, this guy.

13:30.535 --> 13:33.874
Something is obviously going
on at the restaurant now.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.995
But I'm gonna go speak
with Leslie's Mom, Nan.

13:35.996 --> 13:38.315
She's the original
owner of the restaurant.

13:38.316 --> 13:41.930
And I want to see how
far back these issues go.

13:41.931 --> 13:44.313
Nan, thanks for sitting down
with me. I interviewed Leslie

13:44.314 --> 13:46.043
and a couple girls that
work at the restaurant,

13:46.044 --> 13:49.521
so I actually had a
couple questions for you.

13:49.522 --> 13:51.570
Did you ever experience anything?

13:51.571 --> 13:53.232
I had several things.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.967
Uh, one day we had a clock..

13:55.968 --> 13:58.155
I seen it going backwards..

13:58.156 --> 14:01.334
- But there was no battery in it.
- Wow.

14:01.335 --> 14:04.035
It was just kind of
mind-boggling, you know?

14:04.036 --> 14:08.991
And I had one waitress, she took
some dishes from the back dining room

14:08.992 --> 14:10.085
into the kitchen.

14:10.086 --> 14:12.543
When she came in.. And
the vacuum was going.

14:12.544 --> 14:15.413
And she come out, and
she says, "I quit."

14:15.414 --> 14:17.195
And I says, "what do
you mean, you quit?"

14:17.196 --> 14:20.200
And she says, "I'm not kidding.
That vacuum's in there going,"

14:20.201 --> 14:23.621
and it's not plugged in."

14:25.545 --> 14:28.862
Is there any specific location
that employees won't go into?

14:28.863 --> 14:33.593
None of 'em wanted to go over into
where the pool hall originally was.

14:33.594 --> 14:35.005
Did they tell you why?

14:35.006 --> 14:39.465
We used to hear, like,
little kids playing.

14:39.466 --> 14:41.100
Well, it seems like there's
a few things going on

14:41.101 --> 14:43.969
- at that place.
- Yeah. I seen this ghost,

14:43.970 --> 14:46.396
and it come out through the back door,

14:46.397 --> 14:49.726
and it was about maybe a
foot and 1/2 off the floor.

14:49.727 --> 14:51.905
And it floated around the pool table

14:51.906 --> 14:56.106
and went over and went
through the door to the east.

14:56.107 --> 14:57.572
What.. What did it look like?

14:57.573 --> 15:01.394
I could tell it was a woman,
because it had a dress.

15:01.395 --> 15:05.259
In fact, one of the customers
that come in all the time

15:05.260 --> 15:09.280
came in one night, and he says,
"I just seen a lady back there,"

15:09.281 --> 15:15.181
"and she's about 2 feet off the
ground, and she went through the wall."

15:22.282 --> 15:25.083
I'm hearing a woman crying.

15:25.084 --> 15:27.124
Crying.

15:27.153 --> 15:29.673
She's scared.

15:30.251 --> 15:35.120
As a sensitive, I can feel what
a dead person is experiencing.

15:35.121 --> 15:39.526
And whatever has happened to
this woman has her very upset.

15:39.527 --> 15:43.187
Oh, there's a lot of, like..

15:43.219 --> 15:48.799
Man, I just want to start
punching somebody really hard.

15:48.850 --> 15:53.650
Like, I just want to
start punching somebody.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.998
Clocks running backwards,
unexplained power outages,

16:01.999 --> 16:05.091
appliances turning on
and off by themselves..

16:05.092 --> 16:08.675
Strange stuff, but there
could be a simple explanation.

16:08.676 --> 16:14.576
So I've called in an electrician
to give the place a once-over.

16:21.056 --> 16:24.028
You know, it's a long shot,
but sometimes electrical surges

16:24.029 --> 16:27.484
can cause appliances to
turn on and off on their own.

16:27.485 --> 16:33.385
If that's the issue, it's important
to rule it out right off the bat.

16:36.659 --> 16:38.703
Well, I checked everything out,
and there's definitely nothing

16:38.704 --> 16:40.711
in there that would cause
these kinds of problems.

16:40.712 --> 16:43.299
Okay, so nothing you saw could cause

16:43.300 --> 16:45.333
any appliances to turn
on and off by themselves.

16:45.334 --> 16:46.499
- Definitely not, no.
- Okay,

16:46.500 --> 16:49.494
- what about clocks going backwards?
- Definitely not.

16:49.495 --> 16:51.268
Okay. What about power outages?

16:51.269 --> 16:54.105
Not without someone physically
turning something off.

16:54.106 --> 16:58.426
All right, good. That's good. I think.

17:01.056 --> 17:02.788
I think he likes fire.

17:02.789 --> 17:07.229
And that's why he likes the electronics.

17:10.425 --> 17:15.236
He feels like this is his.. His
land, and we should probably leave.

17:15.237 --> 17:21.137
This.. This guy's making me ** angry,
like I'm gonna ** kill somebody.

17:26.965 --> 17:29.121
I think there's a lot of spirit..

17:29.122 --> 17:32.962
Souls that are trapped in there.

17:36.417 --> 17:38.201
They've been contaminated.

17:38.202 --> 17:41.151
You know, somebody did a
ritual and, like, cursed it.

17:41.152 --> 17:45.772
And that stuff can
really screw people up.

17:45.786 --> 17:47.789
A Native American did it.

17:47.790 --> 17:51.810
Like, they physically did a ritual.

17:51.870 --> 17:55.467
You know what? They just need to **
knock it down, to be perfectly honest.

17:55.468 --> 17:59.788
Okay? They just need to knock it down.

18:18.085 --> 18:21.231
What's wrong? You're
making strange faces.

18:21.232 --> 18:25.912
Hmm, I think that's
where the people stay.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.774
What people? Dead people?

18:29.775 --> 18:31.523
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, they're
dead. - So that's..

18:31.524 --> 18:34.464
Where they are now?

18:37.349 --> 18:41.285
I feel like they're all dead together,
like a mass grave, because they're..

18:41.286 --> 18:47.186
You know, I think they're dead together,
bodies are together in the grave.

18:51.842 --> 18:53.616
As an investigator, all I can say

18:53.617 --> 18:56.307
is that when several people
report seeing the same thing,

18:56.308 --> 18:58.614
there's usually something to it.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.074
So I'm headed over to the local library

19:00.075 --> 19:05.775
to see if I can make sense
of whatever's going on here.

19:12.578 --> 19:18.478
Working homicides in the N.Y.P.D.
You get to see some pretty wild stuff.

19:19.055 --> 19:22.208
But as a father, nothing can
prepare you for what I discovered

19:22.209 --> 19:25.629
in the library's archives.

19:38.764 --> 19:42.710
Not one, but four very young children
were killed in a very short time span,

19:42.711 --> 19:45.145
all of them in the town's
flood control channels

19:45.146 --> 19:50.846
that just happen to run behind
the family tree restaurant.

19:55.367 --> 19:58.048
And there's some kids even.

19:58.049 --> 20:01.769
Hmm, there's, like, four kids.

20:03.628 --> 20:06.831
And they did not know
each other in life.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.593
They died at different times?

20:08.594 --> 20:11.678
Yes. I think that they died of..

20:11.679 --> 20:15.459
All of the same kind of stuff.

20:18.413 --> 20:20.873
I see water.

20:21.116 --> 20:24.536
Is there water under here?

20:30.998 --> 20:35.837
With over 25 years of investigative
experience, I can tell you one thing.

20:35.838 --> 20:39.519
Small-town police chiefs know
a lot about the local history.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.205
So I'm headed over to meet
with Santaquin's Chief Howard.

20:42.206 --> 20:48.106
I'm hoping he can tell me more
about how these kids drowned.

20:50.830 --> 20:52.869
I've uncovered some drownings um..

20:52.870 --> 20:57.091
Of young children, actually, here,
pretty close to where the restaurant was.

20:57.092 --> 20:59.026
Can you explain any of what happened?

20:59.027 --> 21:01.258
There's been a number of
children that have drowned

21:01.259 --> 21:05.759
- up until the early '50s, 1951.
- Right.

21:06.758 --> 21:10.321
It's deceptive, the look
of this ditch as it's dry.

21:10.322 --> 21:13.556
But in the springtime, you
can have a ditch such as this,

21:13.557 --> 21:19.457
and within a matter of seconds it
can be full and running rapidly.

21:20.495 --> 21:23.219
And a child hasn't got a chance.

21:23.220 --> 21:25.919
And there's been two
adults that I'm aware of.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.338
Back in the '30s was
a 70-year-old man.

21:28.339 --> 21:31.240
And then in the late '60s, early '70s,

21:31.241 --> 21:37.141
a man fell in and was pulled
out just a block up the street.

21:37.637 --> 21:43.537
One of the children that, uh,
drowned in the '40s in this ditch,

21:43.598 --> 21:48.938
his younger brother lives
just across the street now.

21:49.693 --> 21:51.495
He's a good friend of mine, Dennis Lamb.

21:51.496 --> 21:53.795
- He knows he was found here?
- He does.

21:53.796 --> 21:55.648
And he lives in the house
right across the street?

21:55.649 --> 21:58.649
- Correct.
- Holy **.

22:02.511 --> 22:05.465
Dennis, I uh, was speaking
with the Police Chief in town.

22:05.466 --> 22:09.305
He mentioned that your brother was
one of the drowning victims over here.

22:09.306 --> 22:11.584
- Do you know what happened?
- I.. I know what happened.

22:11.585 --> 22:16.892
My Mother was in the house doing
things, and Robert had gone outside.

22:16.893 --> 22:21.850
And my Mother got worried and wanted to
run outside to find out where he was at,

22:21.851 --> 22:24.611
and he was gone.

22:25.234 --> 22:28.318
And so she knew immediately
that something was wrong.

22:28.319 --> 22:29.806
Was he missing for a while

22:29.807 --> 22:31.103
- and there was a search for him?
- No.

22:31.104 --> 22:33.924
Or did.. Was it..

22:43.386 --> 22:47.656
That must have been
unimaginable for your Mom.

22:47.657 --> 22:51.257
She was completely devastated.

22:51.584 --> 22:53.239
She felt responsible.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.114
She felt it was her fault.

22:56.115 --> 22:58.757
I.. I can't imagine it.

22:58.758 --> 23:01.321
No, you're not supposed
to bury your children.

23:01.322 --> 23:06.662
That's the first time I've
actually cried over him.

23:12.794 --> 23:15.306
Can you talk more
about the crying woman?

23:15.307 --> 23:18.120
This woman was very depressed.

23:18.121 --> 23:22.727
And whatever was happening
to her was very traumatic.

23:22.728 --> 23:25.608
What is she doing?

23:26.261 --> 23:29.381
It's a lot of anger.

23:29.910 --> 23:30.848
And rage.

23:30.849 --> 23:36.505
You know, so, like, she's crying, but
she's angry to the point where she wanted

23:36.506 --> 23:39.746
to, like, kill or harm.

23:59.815 --> 24:03.595
There are kids of various ages.

24:09.925 --> 24:11.845
Boys.

24:12.157 --> 24:15.577
And there are several men.

24:16.650 --> 24:20.550
And I think that they're afraid.

24:27.305 --> 24:30.071
So you were saying, Dennis, that
your brother had passed away,

24:30.072 --> 24:33.815
but several other people
had drowned in these ditches,

24:33.816 --> 24:36.064
you know, an old man, too. You
know anything about an old man?

24:36.065 --> 24:41.267
Yes. My father was out irrigating
his garden, and he found him

24:41.268 --> 24:44.688
lodged under a.. A bridge.

24:46.426 --> 24:47.833
This is unbelievable.

24:47.834 --> 24:51.650
Dennis' father loses his own child
in one of these drainage ditches

24:51.651 --> 24:53.502
then finds an old man in another.

24:53.503 --> 24:55.677
What are the chances of that?

24:55.678 --> 24:58.000
Did your father ever
talk to you about him?

24:58.001 --> 25:02.621
Just that he was
stuffed under the bridge.

25:02.631 --> 25:07.311
And they had quite a
time getting him out.

25:14.321 --> 25:16.241
What?

25:16.528 --> 25:20.008
- Mm-mmm..
- What's wrong?

25:20.506 --> 25:25.606
Well, I saw, like, a
little gremlin-ly kind of..

25:43.211 --> 25:44.597
That was kind of creepy.

25:44.598 --> 25:46.012
Can you describe what you saw?

25:46.013 --> 25:48.894
It was this thing..

25:48.895 --> 25:52.255
That had super-long arms,

25:52.334 --> 25:55.989
weird hips that kind of like came up.

25:55.990 --> 25:59.050
Like, how big is it?

26:01.331 --> 26:03.851
Pretty ** big.

26:06.656 --> 26:07.756
He's a scary guy.

26:07.757 --> 26:10.637
I don't like him.

26:15.963 --> 26:19.933
This guy knows how to
get inside of people.

26:19.934 --> 26:23.534
He can, like, influence them.

26:23.652 --> 26:24.892
What do you mean?

26:24.893 --> 26:29.873
He can go in their bodies
and make them do **.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.375
I'm finally on my way to meet

26:37.376 --> 26:42.896
with Leslie's daughter
Bobbie, who's been out of town.

26:43.694 --> 26:46.943
I need to see if she's experienced
anything that could corroborate

26:46.944 --> 26:51.744
what her Mother and
Grandmother have told me.

26:53.790 --> 26:57.053
Well, Bobbie, I talked to your Mom, talked
to some of the people that work here.

26:57.054 --> 26:58.923
They told me what
they've been experiencing.

26:58.924 --> 27:02.358
So I need to hear from you if
you've been experiencing anything.

27:02.359 --> 27:06.895
Yeah, I've experienced a lot of
things moving, a lot of noises.

27:06.896 --> 27:12.476
I've had blenders turning on
and off, lights flickering.

27:14.052 --> 27:18.185
I've seen a little boy in the West room.

27:18.186 --> 27:19.525
Your Mom owns it now.

27:19.526 --> 27:22.271
You're looking to carry
on the tradition and..

27:22.272 --> 27:24.105
- Yes.
- Actually take over.

27:24.106 --> 27:25.940
- Yes, I'd like to. Yes.
- Why?

27:25.941 --> 27:28.173
Uh, I mean, aren't you
terrified being here?

27:28.174 --> 27:32.229
I am. Um, it's been in
the family for so, so long

27:32.230 --> 27:35.180
that I don't want it to
go anywhere else but to me.

27:35.181 --> 27:39.047
If Amy told you you better not stay here,
you gotta get out, what would you do?

27:39.048 --> 27:41.242
Well, if it was gonna
put my family in danger,

27:41.243 --> 27:46.403
I guess we'd get out,
because family comes first.

28:01.600 --> 28:07.341
The entity I saw on my walk was one of
the most bizarre I've ever encountered.

28:07.342 --> 28:08.880
I sat down with the sketch artist

28:08.881 --> 28:14.161
and forced myself to describe
its grotesque features.

28:15.540 --> 28:21.300
If you were to describe the
face, what shape would it be?

28:22.718 --> 28:27.338
Normal here, but just
kind of bigger here.

28:27.595 --> 28:30.978
How were the eyes on the face?

28:30.979 --> 28:33.601
There's no eyelids. Just bulbous.

28:33.602 --> 28:36.624
- Pupils?
- No, it was just white.

28:36.625 --> 28:39.385
Interesting. Okay.

28:39.657 --> 28:42.057
A hunchback.

28:42.373 --> 28:46.900
You could actually see,
like, the vertebrae, like..

28:46.901 --> 28:49.421
It was weird.

28:49.473 --> 28:54.273
You wouldn't want to
meet this guy anywhere.

28:55.296 --> 28:58.367
- Are we anywhere in the ballpark?
- Well, yeah, this looks good.

28:58.368 --> 29:00.288
Okay.

29:13.259 --> 29:14.527
Well, Bobbie, you told me a lot.

29:14.528 --> 29:18.028
- I mean, is there anything else going on?
- There is one more thing.

29:18.029 --> 29:20.640
There's an old man that's
been lurking around here,

29:20.641 --> 29:24.661
and he followed me home one night.

29:30.398 --> 29:31.569
Explain that to me. What happened?

29:31.570 --> 29:34.195
Well, I went home and
was getting ready for bed

29:34.196 --> 29:36.505
and laid down, and every
time I closed my eyes,

29:36.506 --> 29:42.406
I could feel his hands around
my neck, pulling me off my bed.

29:45.146 --> 29:49.344
And so I shook really hard and opened
my eyes, and I seen him up by my closet.

29:49.345 --> 29:53.845
And he just disappeared
into the ceiling.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.610
It was him.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.697
It was him. Like, I know it was him.

29:59.698 --> 30:03.298
Without a doubt, it was him.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.007
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

30:36.008 --> 30:37.776
Not only do we not cross paths,

30:37.777 --> 30:43.177
but we never discuss each
other's findings until now.

30:43.436 --> 30:47.304
Leslie, you actually called
us in, because you're concerned

30:47.305 --> 30:51.170
about turning the restaurant
over to your daughter.

30:51.171 --> 30:52.457
Yes.

30:52.458 --> 30:54.088
So with that, Amy, if
you could just tell us

30:54.089 --> 30:59.249
what you encountered when
you first did your walk.

30:59.776 --> 31:04.696
Initially, what I got
was this male telling me

31:04.701 --> 31:09.801
that the whole building
needed to be pushed back.

31:11.642 --> 31:16.322
And it had been a lot
of different things.

31:17.982 --> 31:21.121
This part of the building my
grandpa built 40 years ago.

31:21.122 --> 31:24.463
And we turned it into a
restaurant about 26 years ago.

31:24.464 --> 31:26.097
Okay.

31:26.098 --> 31:28.659
The old part of the
building was a saloon.

31:28.660 --> 31:31.510
- Mm-hum. - Uh, they did
boxing in the basement.

31:31.511 --> 31:34.811
- Interesting.
- Gambling.

31:36.692 --> 31:39.428
Change, change. Cha..

31:39.429 --> 31:42.309
Like a constantly..

31:42.437 --> 31:45.617
Uh, transitioning space.

31:47.009 --> 31:52.289
Whatever is here has an
idea of what it should be.

31:52.755 --> 31:56.355
And it's not been that yet.

32:00.019 --> 32:03.809
When I came in, I was
talking to this gentleman.

32:03.810 --> 32:05.581
His name is Henry.

32:05.582 --> 32:08.761
And he said that he is trying to..

32:08.762 --> 32:13.082
Communicate to you guys via electronics.

32:15.322 --> 32:18.595
Part of the issue that they're having

32:18.596 --> 32:21.411
is appliances turning
on and off by themselves.

32:21.412 --> 32:22.577
Okay.

32:22.578 --> 32:24.733
I brought an electrician
in to check it out.

32:24.734 --> 32:25.992
Uh-huh.

32:25.993 --> 32:27.533
Nothing wrong with the electricity here.

32:27.534 --> 32:30.294
Okay. Interesting.

32:34.863 --> 32:37.096
So what else did you
see during your walk?

32:37.097 --> 32:40.361
There were children. There
were about four of them.

32:40.362 --> 32:43.306
And there's some kids even.

32:43.307 --> 32:45.735
Are you interacting with
them or just observing them?

32:45.736 --> 32:51.636
I'm just.. They're staring at
me, and I'm staring at them.

32:51.768 --> 32:55.698
They all did die from the same thing.

32:55.699 --> 33:00.465
Yeah, there's one I actually
almost ran into turning a corner.

33:00.466 --> 33:01.322
Oh, wow.

33:01.323 --> 33:05.327
And then I witnessed
one, dark hair, very thin.

33:05.328 --> 33:10.226
I did uncover during the
investigation that four kids drowned..

33:10.227 --> 33:12.163
Oh, wow.

33:12.164 --> 33:17.804
In an irrigation ditch right
around the corner from here.

33:24.939 --> 33:26.999
I actually got one of
the death certificates

33:27.000 --> 33:29.657
of this poor kid, this kid Robert Lamb.

33:29.658 --> 33:34.278
He was 17 months old,
a little, cute kid.

33:38.353 --> 33:41.297
He literally washed up
right behind the restaurant..

33:41.298 --> 33:43.157
- Wow.
- So they really suffered

33:43.158 --> 33:45.056
when they died, these kids.

33:45.057 --> 33:50.957
- It's.. It's a little heartbreaking.
- Yeah, definitely heartbreaking.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.180
I did see a woman.

33:58.546 --> 34:03.491
Then walking down the stairs
hearing a female crying

34:03.492 --> 34:06.758
and just feeling the despair.

34:06.759 --> 34:08.850
She was very depressed.

34:08.851 --> 34:14.255
And like, whatever was happening
to her was very traumatic.

34:14.255 --> 34:16.451
- My Mother has seen her.
- Yeah.

34:16.452 --> 34:21.552
Uh, neighbors around the
line area have seen her.

34:22.963 --> 34:26.203
That's freaking me out.

34:31.420 --> 34:34.155
This kid, Robert Lamb.. I
just happened to find out

34:34.156 --> 34:36.853
that his brother was still
alive and living here.

34:36.855 --> 34:39.135
When I spoke to him, I
asked him about his Mom.

34:39.136 --> 34:41.772
And she came out looking for her son

34:41.773 --> 34:47.672
who wandered off, and somebody found
him in the ditch right across the street.

34:48.261 --> 34:54.161
She blamed herself for years,
which I guess any Mother would do.

34:57.146 --> 34:59.335
Amy, you mentioned
about a guy named Henry.

34:59.336 --> 35:02.151
Bobbie and Crissa..
Crissa's an employee..

35:02.152 --> 35:06.097
Have had an interaction
with an elderly man.

35:06.098 --> 35:06.839
Yes.

35:06.840 --> 35:12.654
There's a photo here of a man that
she says she's pretty sure is him,

35:12.655 --> 35:16.495
and that's this older guy here.

35:19.560 --> 35:22.440
That's interesting.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.652
I got his death certificate on this man.

35:25.653 --> 35:28.573
This guy's name is William Wallace York.

35:28.574 --> 35:30.866
Now you seem to think
it was the same guy also.

35:30.867 --> 35:34.211
Yeah, I got a really bad
feeling when I seen him.

35:34.212 --> 35:37.507
- Explain that to Amy.
- After work late at night I went home.

35:37.508 --> 35:41.240
As soon as I got in bed and closed my
eyes, I could feel hands around my neck

35:41.241 --> 35:43.131
trying to pull me off the bed.

35:43.132 --> 35:44.694
Oh, boy.

35:44.695 --> 35:47.515
This is not good.

35:50.553 --> 35:55.353
A lot of the dead
people here are not good.

35:55.533 --> 35:58.708
Amy, is that the guy you sketched?

35:58.709 --> 36:02.369
No. Uh, what I sketched was..

36:02.850 --> 36:05.910
A very strange thing.

36:10.768 --> 36:14.000
Okay, you guys want to
take a look at the sketch?

36:14.001 --> 36:15.575
Yeah.

36:15.576 --> 36:18.996
- I'm nervous to.
- Yeah.

36:19.079 --> 36:24.119
I don't see the sketch
Amy does until the end.

36:31.696 --> 36:36.316
Are you kidding me?
This is what you saw?

36:36.611 --> 36:40.211
I know. It's really strange.

36:42.695 --> 36:45.155
Oh, my gosh.

37:00.112 --> 37:04.672
What I sketched was
a very strange thing.

37:07.849 --> 37:13.369
Okay, you know what? Let's
take a look at the sketch.

37:20.545 --> 37:23.485
Are you kidding me?

37:30.557 --> 37:34.457
Oh, my gosh, are you kidding me?

37:36.884 --> 37:40.244
- Are you serious?
- Wow.

37:54.861 --> 37:57.021
Oh, wow.

37:57.038 --> 37:58.878
I don't normally get chills.
I got chills just now.

37:58.879 --> 38:00.581
- Oh.
- Yeah. Me, too.

38:00.582 --> 38:06.482
That was peering out from the ladies
room in the other part of the building.

38:07.726 --> 38:09.646
What?

38:09.810 --> 38:13.290
- Mm-mmm..
- What's wrong?

38:13.586 --> 38:18.686
Well, I saw, like, a
little gremlin-ly kind of..

38:21.159 --> 38:22.776
That was kinda creepy.

38:22.777 --> 38:25.039
This guy knows how to
get inside of people.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.339
He can, like, influence them.

38:27.340 --> 38:32.871
What they can do is project images
that will scare you or disarm you

38:32.872 --> 38:34.724
into thinking that it's good.

38:34.725 --> 38:40.125
And so it could be this
thing. It could be a child.

38:41.507 --> 38:44.678
Bobbie, didn't you tell me that
something followed your Mom home?

38:44.679 --> 38:47.253
Yeah, it was a little
boy about 7 years old.

38:47.254 --> 38:50.896
She felt like it was innocent.

38:50.897 --> 38:56.297
You know, whatever it needs
from you, it will become.

39:01.304 --> 39:02.890
There is this older man.

39:02.891 --> 39:06.191
He works for this thing.

39:06.371 --> 39:10.031
And, um, they have an agenda.

39:10.877 --> 39:13.080
They are out for themselves.

39:13.081 --> 39:18.061
And they will manipulate
to get what they want.

39:18.839 --> 39:22.439
These people want energy to..

39:22.964 --> 39:25.604
Become powerful.

39:26.308 --> 39:29.843
I never thought we'd
find something like that.

39:29.844 --> 39:33.924
What he likes to do is tag people.

39:34.319 --> 39:39.239
And then he can pull
them back when they die.

39:40.187 --> 39:43.787
He wants more people to die.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.586
Okay, Leslie, you've
heard and you've seen

39:50.587 --> 39:52.851
what we uncovered in the investigation.

39:52.852 --> 39:56.110
Uh, the most pressing
question here tonight is,

39:56.111 --> 40:01.636
is it safe for you to take this
restaurant and pass it on to your daughter?

40:01.637 --> 40:07.337
If you want this thing to
stop, you gotta listen to Amy.

40:08.930 --> 40:12.624
I would like to tell you to leave..

40:12.625 --> 40:14.953
But I can't,

40:14.954 --> 40:19.266
because you kind of
inherited a situation.

40:19.267 --> 40:23.579
And something needs to
be done pretty quickly.

40:23.580 --> 40:26.061
You know, you guys
obviously didn't start this.

40:26.062 --> 40:31.962
You know, unfortunately, it's your
responsibility to take care of this.

40:33.371 --> 40:38.249
What I think happened here is that
there was an upset Native American.

40:38.250 --> 40:41.382
Who actually did a curse.

40:41.383 --> 40:46.108
And the people who have been
trapped need to be released.

40:46.109 --> 40:51.629
This is going to be a really,
really difficult process.

40:53.010 --> 40:56.534
What I would do is find
out the tribe that was here

40:56.535 --> 41:00.029
and then find an elder
from that tribe to help you.

41:00.030 --> 41:02.696
You want a blessing.
You want a cleansing.

41:02.697 --> 41:04.424
You want this curse to be broken.

41:04.425 --> 41:08.391
And bring in possibly
different religious leaders

41:08.392 --> 41:12.952
to help move on all
the different people.

41:13.816 --> 41:15.599
How.. How many are we talking?

41:15.600 --> 41:18.242
As many as possible.

41:18.243 --> 41:22.143
I know it's so big and intense.

41:22.366 --> 41:25.718
But if you walk away, you
could still be affected.

41:25.719 --> 41:31.619
You could die, and you could become
trapped in an eternity in agony.

41:43.298 --> 41:45.257
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, first thing

41:45.258 --> 41:47.904
- we're gonna do is check our history..
- Yeah.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.884
- And find out what Indian..
- What Indian tribe was here.

41:50.885 --> 41:53.297
And we'll move on to getting it blessed.

41:53.298 --> 41:56.522
It sounds like a lot of
steps, but we'll take 'em.

41:56.523 --> 41:58.516
Well, you guys are pretty
passionate about this restaurant.

41:58.517 --> 42:00.097
It sounds like you want to fight.

42:00.098 --> 42:01.759
- We are. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

42:01.760 --> 42:06.096
You are. You're fighting
for your life here.

42:06.097 --> 42:09.622
It won't be easy, but if Leslie
and Bobbie follow my advice,

42:09.623 --> 42:13.120
the dead can finally be
released and set free.

42:13.121 --> 42:14.487
Only then will it be safe

42:14.488 --> 42:18.925
to pass this family restaurant
on to future generations.
