WEBVTT

00:07.417 --> 00:09.625
Ah, Karate Con.

00:09.709 --> 00:11.458
Three days to get new students.

00:11.542 --> 00:14.792
You can just smell the new business
in the air.

00:14.875 --> 00:16.083
That's urinal cakes.

00:16.166 --> 00:17.792
Our booth is practically
in the men's room.

00:20.125 --> 00:21.500
The Trent Darby style.

00:21.625 --> 00:24.041
Trent Darby thinks he's all that
with his perfect physique,

00:24.125 --> 00:25.667
and all of his trophies,

00:25.750 --> 00:27.417
and his fancy dojos.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.625
Yeah, what a loser.

00:28.709 --> 00:29.792
I know, right?

00:30.625 --> 00:32.083
Guys, guys! I can't believe it.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.333
Sloane Jennings is here.

00:33.417 --> 00:34.792
I am her biggest fan!

00:34.875 --> 00:36.250
All right, people, listen up.

00:36.917 --> 00:39.500
Now, we've come to Karate Con
to find a new dojo for Sloane

00:39.583 --> 00:41.333
that will provide discipline and focus,

00:41.417 --> 00:44.500
so she can dominate
the Girls' National Karate Tournament.

00:44.583 --> 00:48.875
And to introduce
my new Sloane Jennings Acne Scrub.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.500
You don't have to be a black belt
to fight blackheads.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.166
Do you have any idea what this means?

00:58.250 --> 01:00.041
I can finally get rid
of that patch of zits on my--

01:00.125 --> 01:01.041
Rudy.

01:01.458 --> 01:03.792
They're looking for a new dojo for Sloane.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.083
That could be us.

01:05.750 --> 01:06.875
Here's my book.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.625
<i>The Trent Darby Story.</i>

01:08.709 --> 01:10.750
- It's the story of--
- Trent Darby?

01:10.959 --> 01:12.542
Oh, you read it?

01:13.333 --> 01:15.083
I'd like to offer you my book.

01:15.166 --> 01:16.542
It's my autobiography.

01:16.625 --> 01:18.375
<i>From Rags to Rudy.</i>

01:18.458 --> 01:19.667
Let me guess,

01:19.750 --> 01:22.458
the story of a poor boy
who rose up to be a sensei?

01:22.542 --> 01:24.709
Uh, no. It's the story of a boy

01:24.792 --> 01:27.375
who changed his name
from "Rags" to "Rudy."

01:28.458 --> 01:29.709
Yeah, you heard me.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.542
I was a boy named Rags.

01:34.542 --> 01:37.917

<i>Hup!</i>

02:22.125 --> 02:23.166
Hup!

02:23.542 --> 02:25.583
Oh, you guys, we're in the wrong dojo.

02:25.667 --> 02:26.709
Sorry, sir.

02:28.166 --> 02:30.583
Rudy, what did you do to the place?

02:30.667 --> 02:33.625
Sloane and her manager
are on their way over here.

02:33.709 --> 02:36.458
They said it was important to them
to get to know the real us,

02:36.542 --> 02:39.208
so I changed everything about who we are.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.166
It has to be perfect.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.500
Jack, Kim,
go put on your formal training gis.

02:44.583 --> 02:46.417
Milton, Jerry, get out.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.875
- Good call.
- On it.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.166
Hey, Rudy,
where did these new students come from?

02:51.250 --> 02:52.583
Why are they so good looking?

02:52.667 --> 02:55.500
Oh, I hired them
from the karate modeling agency,

02:55.583 --> 02:57.500
Black Belt Beauties.

02:57.583 --> 02:59.125
Rudy, I know you really want
Sloane to join,

02:59.208 --> 03:01.125
but don't you think
you're getting a little bit crazy?

03:01.208 --> 03:02.458
No, I do not.

03:02.542 --> 03:05.041
If a superstar like Sloane comes here,

03:05.125 --> 03:07.417
I could really turn this dojo
into something special.

03:07.667 --> 03:08.625
Wow.

03:08.709 --> 03:11.834
If Sloane came here, we'd finally have
another girl in the dojo.

03:11.917 --> 03:14.709
And all that publicity
would mean new students.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.417
And new students means more classes

03:16.500 --> 03:18.542
which means you can promote me to sensei.

03:18.625 --> 03:19.875
Assistant sensei.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.750
I think I'm having a moment.

03:22.208 --> 03:23.709
I'm having the same moment.

03:23.792 --> 03:26.458
Uh, guys, come on. I really doubt
you're both having the same--

03:26.542 --> 03:28.834
Oh, my gosh, I'm having my moment!

03:36.542 --> 03:37.959
You lied to me, Jerry.

03:38.041 --> 03:39.625
You told me nobody would make fun of me

03:39.709 --> 03:41.458
for wearing the sweater
that Julie knitted me,

03:41.542 --> 03:44.208
but everybody laughed and pointed.

03:44.250 --> 03:47.417
Oh, there you are, you little liar.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.959
You told me that Theo from the bakery

03:50.041 --> 03:51.750
wanted to go out on a date with me.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.917
Uh... He did.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.458
Oh, really?

03:55.542 --> 03:57.709
Well, I got all dressed up

03:57.792 --> 03:58.834
and I went over there,

03:58.917 --> 04:00.125
and when I said "I'm your date,"

04:00.208 --> 04:02.041
he was none too pleased.

04:02.125 --> 04:02.959
He was upset?

04:03.041 --> 04:05.041
Oh, not as upset as his girlfriend was.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.625
The next thing I know,

04:07.709 --> 04:09.834
I'm looking at the business end
of a French loaf.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.625
Relax, Joan. It was just a little lie.

04:12.709 --> 04:15.000
- Oh.
<i>-</i>

04:15.417 --> 04:16.458
Ah.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.750
Yo. Whoa.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.542
Whoa, Donna. Calm down.

04:20.625 --> 04:22.250
Uh, no, no, no.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.333
Uh, I was with Kathy last night,

04:24.417 --> 04:29.083
because I was asking her
how I could make you happier.

04:29.709 --> 04:32.166
No, because that's what you deserve.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.709
Oh, no,
you're my one and only special lady.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.083
Yes, you are.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.667
Okay, kisses. Bye-bye.

04:40.834 --> 04:43.375
That was so sweet.

04:43.458 --> 04:46.083
Oh, Donna's a lucky girl.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.875
Joan, he's lying.

04:47.959 --> 04:49.125
What?

04:49.959 --> 04:51.667
Oh, man, he got me again.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.542
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

04:54.625 --> 04:55.709
Oh, oh! They're coming.

04:55.792 --> 04:57.000
<i>Places! Places!</i>

04:58.500 --> 05:00.917
- Go.
-

05:03.500 --> 05:05.458
No, no, no!

05:05.542 --> 05:07.417
You have brought shame upon me

05:07.500 --> 05:09.792
and this dojo of excellence.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.208
My humble apologies, great sensei.

05:14.709 --> 05:16.333
We hang our heads in shame.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.125
Oh!

05:21.208 --> 05:23.083
Sloane and Vance,
I didn't notice you come in,

05:23.166 --> 05:26.208
what, with all of the focus
and discipline.

05:26.291 --> 05:27.583
Let me show you around.

05:28.875 --> 05:32.041
Kim, just because Sloane's here
don't freak out and get all yappy.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.834
I do not get yappy, Jack.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.208
- You get yappy.
- No, I don't!

05:35.291 --> 05:36.834
- Yap, yap, yap.
- I would know if I was a yapper.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.291
- If I was a yapper--
Hey, hey, hey.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.583
Get these pretty people
back to the agency.

05:40.667 --> 05:41.750
But be careful.

05:41.834 --> 05:44.000
If you get a scratch on them,
I lose my deposit.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.917
Uh, hi, I'm Kim.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.542
I think it's really cool
you're thinking about joining our dojo.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.458
Oh, well, it's not my decision.

05:54.542 --> 05:56.667
My manager Vance decides everything.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.792
I'll find out tomorrow
at the Karate Con Press Conference.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.291
Oh, well...

06:00.375 --> 06:02.041
You know, that's the thing about managers.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.041
They're always managing.
It's kind of funny actually.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.750
I don't really know how I'd manage
without a manager

06:05.834 --> 06:07.291
doing all the managing
that I'd need to be managed.

06:07.375 --> 06:08.417
I just can't stop being a yapper!

06:08.500 --> 06:09.709
Kim!

06:11.125 --> 06:12.542
- Relax.
- Okay.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.417
Look, I really like this place.

06:14.667 --> 06:19.250
It's very different
from the other dojos I've trained at.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.709
Sloane, the students and I
are gonna leave now.

06:21.792 --> 06:24.458
And as we do, I hope you'll appreciate
how good we look doing it.

06:39.250 --> 06:40.792
Oh, hey.

06:40.875 --> 06:43.917
You guys here for the free
midnight falafel special, too?

06:44.375 --> 06:47.458
No. We made that up
because you have a problem lying,

06:47.542 --> 06:49.000
and we're gonna help you stop.

06:49.083 --> 06:52.458
You lied to get me here to stop lying?

06:52.542 --> 06:53.667
Ohh.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.875
I did not see that coming.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.166
Since we know
you can't do this by yourself,

07:01.542 --> 07:04.000
we got you a little helping hand.

07:05.542 --> 07:07.500
I borrowed a lie detector

07:07.583 --> 07:10.166
- from my friend at the police department,
-

07:10.250 --> 07:11.875
and Milton modified it.

07:11.959 --> 07:14.542
It's gonna help you learn
to tell the truth.

07:15.709 --> 07:16.875
Jerry.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.000
When you asked to be my lab partner,

07:19.083 --> 07:21.750
did you intend on doing your share
of the work?

07:21.834 --> 07:23.500
- Yes, I did. Ow!
<i>-</i>

07:24.375 --> 07:25.500
I mean half of the work.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.041
Ow! Some of the work.

07:27.125 --> 07:28.875
I wanted you to do everything.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.750
<i>-
- Jerry, we're trying to teach you</i>

07:30.834 --> 07:32.875
to tell the truth
no matter how much it hurts.

07:32.959 --> 07:34.041
Fine.

07:34.542 --> 07:36.375
But just so you know,
this thing doesn't hurt at all.

07:36.458 --> 07:37.625
<i>-
- Ow!</i>

07:37.709 --> 07:39.083
It hurts a little. Aah!

07:39.166 --> 07:40.542
More than a little.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.375
Okay. Okay, Milton. You can turn it off.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.709
Milton!

07:43.792 --> 07:46.125
Turn it off!

07:46.208 --> 07:49.500

Rudy Gillespie? What are you doing here?

07:55.125 --> 07:57.000
There's no way
Sloane's gonna pick your dump.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.917
Our place is not a dump.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.125
She's not gonna pick our dump, is she?

08:09.542 --> 08:11.083
Thank you all for coming.

08:11.542 --> 08:13.333
After careful consideration,

08:13.417 --> 08:15.750
we have decided
that Sloane will compete for Nationals

08:15.834 --> 08:17.834
as a member of the Bobby Wasabi Dojo!

08:17.917 --> 08:21.667
Yes!
- No!

08:21.750 --> 08:22.959
Rudy, they picked us.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.000
Yes!

08:34.166 --> 08:36.709
No, I'm sorry.
All of our classes are booked.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.375
I don't care who you know.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.834
Excuse me, there is no reason
to use that kind of language.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.000
Love you too, Mother.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.458
Getting Sloane to join was awesome.

08:49.542 --> 08:51.125
- I'm proud of you.
- You should be.

08:51.333 --> 08:55.125
I exploited the skills, fame,
and talents of a 14-year-old girl.

08:55.375 --> 08:56.750
That's just good business.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.041
Hey, look!
It's Sloane Jennings, everybody.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.709
Who wants to see a little sparring?

09:13.667 --> 09:15.417
Now I know how it feels to be Milton.

09:18.542 --> 09:20.250
Okay, Sloane needs a break.
We're going to lunch.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.208
Okay, fine.

09:22.250 --> 09:24.542
But if she leaves anything on her plate,
get a doggie bag.

09:24.625 --> 09:25.959
We can sell that online.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.375
Jack, now that you're an assistant sensei,

09:30.458 --> 09:32.041
I got you a little something.

09:32.792 --> 09:33.792
Whoa.

09:33.875 --> 09:36.125
My own business cards. This is awesome.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.583
You think that's awesome,
you should check out mine.

The old Jerry wouldn't tell
the Health Inspector the truth,

09:52.709 --> 09:54.250
but those days are over.

09:54.583 --> 09:55.625
You see this three-layer dip?

09:55.959 --> 09:59.083
The layers are grease, mold,
and goat hair.

10:01.750 --> 10:02.834
What are you doing?

10:02.917 --> 10:04.333
No, I'm just being honest.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.709
Dude, after a day of being slapped silly
by your truth machine,

10:06.792 --> 10:08.250
I will never lie again.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.542
Jerry, you're taking the truth too far.

10:10.625 --> 10:13.417
You told Julie I hated her sweater,
and she broke up with me.

10:13.959 --> 10:16.208
The truth is maybe you two
weren't meant to be together.

10:17.625 --> 10:18.583
Hey, guys.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.208
Just grabbing a little lunch with my boss.

10:20.291 --> 10:23.542
Oh. So this is the guy you call "Ratface."

10:25.041 --> 10:27.625
Uh, I, I do not.

10:27.709 --> 10:28.834
Ratface, come back!

10:29.166 --> 10:31.959
I don't call you ratface!
Ratface, I swear!

10:33.750 --> 10:36.542
I am so fired. Thanks, Jerry.

10:36.625 --> 10:37.917
Oh, you're welcome.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.917
Just another day of telling the truth.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.667
Joan, what have we done?

10:43.750 --> 10:46.959
Jerry's truth-telling has upset
the natural order of the universe.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.125
Maybe he's not supposed to tell the truth.

10:49.208 --> 10:50.959
We got to return him
to his original state.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.208
Yes.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.792
Woof. That is one funny-looking baby.

11:01.542 --> 11:03.125
I see where he gets it from.

- Come on. Do it please? Okay.
- Got it.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.583
Yes, I'm here.

11:17.667 --> 11:18.792
Again.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.166
My friend Thelma Lou

11:22.250 --> 11:23.542
would like some pea soup.

11:24.375 --> 11:27.083
And Betty Jo would like some turtle soup.

11:27.792 --> 11:30.208
So we were just hoping you'd bring us
a big old steaming bowl

11:30.291 --> 11:32.375
- of turtle pea soup.
- Of turtle pea soup.

11:36.166 --> 11:38.083
Remember I laughed when you tip me.

11:40.542 --> 11:41.875
I've had a blast here today.

11:41.959 --> 11:43.500
- This place is great.
- This?

11:43.583 --> 11:45.291
A dumb karaoke cafe in Seaford?

11:45.375 --> 11:46.959
Come on, you travel all over the world.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.166
You have a great life.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.417
I have a life?

11:49.667 --> 11:50.709
Yeah.

11:55.917 --> 11:58.542
That's the closest I've had
to a boyfriend in two years.

12:00.125 --> 12:02.125
I have been turned into a business.

12:02.208 --> 12:05.709
I would give anything
to just be a normal girl again.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.000
So just be one.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.250
I can't.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.041
My manager runs my career.

12:10.583 --> 12:13.792
He discovered me when my parents
couldn't even afford karate classes,

12:13.875 --> 12:16.083
and now, thanks to him,

12:16.166 --> 12:18.041
my family has a better life.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.375
When was the last time you had fun?

12:21.500 --> 12:22.667
You know what? Follow me.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.375
- No.
Come on, let's go.

12:24.458 --> 12:25.500
Come on, come on, come on.

12:25.583 --> 12:26.709
Hey, Evan!

12:29.250 --> 12:30.458
B-19.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.166
Kim, stop. I can't do this.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.709
Yes, you can, okay?

12:35.083 --> 12:38.333
Look, just read the screen and look good.

13:45.709 --> 13:47.375
You know,
we could win that karaoke competition.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.917
Hey, hey, hey! Where have you two been?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.417
We have been worried sick about Sloane.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.709
- You're late.
-

13:55.792 --> 13:57.583
What's the big deal, guys?

13:57.667 --> 14:00.083
Sloane must win Nationals
to keep her endorsements.

14:00.542 --> 14:01.709
Kim is a bad influence.

14:01.792 --> 14:03.375
You want Sloane here,
Kim's gonna have to go.

14:03.709 --> 14:04.792
Excuse me,

14:04.875 --> 14:06.750
Kim is a wonderful student
with a bright future--

14:06.834 --> 14:09.125
- Fine. Sloane, come on. We're leaving.
- Oh, this Kim? She's out.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.041
You're kicking me out of the dojo?

14:13.125 --> 14:14.583
That is a little harsh, Rudy.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.083
Okay, you want to know
the truth about Sloane?

14:17.166 --> 14:19.750
She's miserable.
Tell them what you told me.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.166
I'm... sorry I'm late.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.625
I'll go put on my gi.

14:32.375 --> 14:33.875
Wait, Kim! Kim!

14:33.959 --> 14:36.291
You know, in time Kim will realize

14:36.333 --> 14:38.208
that this is a serious dojo,

14:38.291 --> 14:40.041
and I am a serious sensei.

in your pocket.

14:59.083 --> 15:00.250
Wait, what?

15:01.667 --> 15:03.333
Yo, what happened to Phil's?

15:03.417 --> 15:05.166
Because you told
the Health Inspector the truth,

15:05.250 --> 15:06.500
Phil's was closed down.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.792
Phil and Tootsie
are in a really bad place.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.458
It's so sad.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.000
Covered in fleas, eating cans,

15:14.083 --> 15:15.792
head-butting shoppers,

15:15.875 --> 15:18.166
and Tootsie ended up in a petting zoo.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.959
Dude, what was that?

15:26.041 --> 15:27.959
Well, those were the girls
you've told the truth to.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.333
When they found out
that they weren't your special lady,

15:30.417 --> 15:33.208
they lost all trust in boys
and vowed revenge.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.166
Why doesn't Joan help the poor guy?

15:36.041 --> 15:39.667
Well, because of you, Ratface fired her,
and the mall became lawless.

15:44.625 --> 15:45.959
Ha, ha!

15:46.041 --> 15:49.625
Now I am the one
who causes crime to happen.

15:49.709 --> 15:51.834
I stole the mall jewels!

15:59.542 --> 16:00.917
Well, at least you're okay, Milton.

16:03.542 --> 16:04.417
Milton?

16:06.041 --> 16:07.166

<i>Here lies Milton Krupnick.</i>

16:27.750 --> 16:30.125

16:30.208 --> 16:33.458
and Milton died of a broken heart."

16:34.291 --> 16:35.375
Wait, what?

16:35.917 --> 16:37.917
No. Oh, no, no, no.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.458
Somebody please tell me this is a dream.

16:39.542 --> 16:40.875
It's not a dream, Jerry.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.166
It's a lesson.

16:42.667 --> 16:43.875
We're just trying to show you

16:43.959 --> 16:46.500
what would happen
if you told nothing but the truth.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.792
Wait...

16:48.166 --> 16:49.583
But that's what you wanted me to do.

16:49.667 --> 16:50.667
The trick, Jerry,

16:50.750 --> 16:53.083
is figuring out when to tell the truth

16:53.166 --> 16:54.625
and when to hold back.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.625
Oh, I think I get it.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.083
Hey, check this out, Milton.

16:59.875 --> 17:02.500

17:25.166 --> 17:26.458
What's the matter, Sloane?

17:26.542 --> 17:28.250
I feel terrible.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.500
Because of me,
Kim got thrown out of the dojo

17:30.583 --> 17:33.250
and all she did was say
what I didn't have the guts to say.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.166
I hate karate.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.333
Uh, by hate...

17:38.417 --> 17:40.166
You mean you sort of don't like it,

17:40.250 --> 17:43.125
but you still want to go out there

17:43.291 --> 17:44.333

17:44.417 --> 17:45.375
Rudy.

17:45.709 --> 17:46.917
Sorry.

17:47.458 --> 17:50.125
I'm just tired of selling dumb products.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.542
Dumb products?

17:51.625 --> 17:54.750
Uh, your Sloane Jennings Shampoo
was the only friend my hair had

17:54.834 --> 17:56.291
during my summer of split ends.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.125
Sloane, if you're not happy,
you don't have to do this.

18:01.208 --> 18:02.458
Well, of course I do.

18:02.959 --> 18:04.125
I can't let people down.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.125
No, we're the ones who let you down.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.542
I was so caught up
in wanting to be your sensei

18:08.625 --> 18:10.458
that I forgot to be your sensei.

18:10.542 --> 18:11.792
I'm sorry.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.208
Sloane,

18:14.417 --> 18:15.625

18:21.709 --> 18:22.917
Hey, Betty Jo.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.125
Sloane?

18:25.208 --> 18:26.834
What are you doing here?

18:26.917 --> 18:28.667
I thought you were still pretending
to like karate.

18:28.750 --> 18:32.125
Thanks to you, I finally had the guts
to say how I really feel.

18:32.208 --> 18:35.208
And I know what it's like
to be a little girl with a dream.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.166
Yeah, I heard it.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.500

in the karaoke finals is...

18:41.583 --> 18:42.583
