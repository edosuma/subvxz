WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.280
WE ARE HERE TODAY
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE

00:09.280 --> 00:10.711
THAT THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT

00:10.711 --> 00:14.315
WAS PRECIPITATED
BY OUR EXPERIMENT.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.347
(woman) WAS THE EXPERIMENT
PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY FUNDED?
(man) WHO DESIGNED
THIS EXPERIMENT?

00:16.347 --> 00:18.489
(Lloyd) NO, NO, PLEASE, PLEASE.
IF YOU JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT...

00:18.489 --> 00:22.353
HEY. YOU OKAY?
I'M GUESSING MARK TOLD YOU
WHAT I SAW.

00:22.353 --> 00:23.794
HE DID, YEAH.
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

00:23.794 --> 00:25.796
THE FUTURE CAN CHANGE.
IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.

00:25.796 --> 00:27.798
GET IN THE VAN, MR. SIMCOE.
PLEASE!

00:27.798 --> 00:30.501
GET IN THE VAN! GO!
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M STARING AT?

00:30.501 --> 00:32.503
I'M WATCHING
THE SECURITY CAMERA FEED

00:32.503 --> 00:34.435
OF YOUR AMAZING POOCH-SCREW
IN HONG KONG.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.807
STAN--
Shut up!

00:36.807 --> 00:39.210
IT WAS SENT TO ME BY THE DAMN
U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.811
You've succeeded

00:40.811 --> 00:42.373
IN CHANGING THE FUTURE.

00:42.373 --> 00:45.376
HERE.

00:45.376 --> 00:47.218
WEDECK'S ORDERS.

00:47.218 --> 00:49.780
LOOKS LIKE WE FINALLY HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

00:49.780 --> 00:53.053
NEITHER OF US ARE FBI.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.627
I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY
ABOUT A MAN I KNOW--

00:56.627 --> 01:00.291
A WINDOW WASHER IN LOS ANGELES.

01:02.493 --> 01:05.636
NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT HIM--

01:05.636 --> 01:09.440
JUST GOING ABOUT HIS LIFE,
LIVING FROM DAY TO DAY.
HOOK ME UP.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.372
VAGUE PLANS. FEW DREAMS.

01:11.372 --> 01:15.806
AND IF HE HAD ANY ASPIRATIONS,
HE NEVER SPOKE OF THEM.

01:15.806 --> 01:18.279
(horns honking)

01:18.279 --> 01:20.281
LIKE MOST OF US,

01:20.281 --> 01:24.115
HE WAS ALREADY UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN THE BLACKOUT HIT.

01:25.856 --> 01:28.319
(clank)

01:28.319 --> 01:31.362
(machinery whirring)

01:31.362 --> 01:34.625
(tires screeching,
loud crashing)

01:37.828 --> 01:40.171
BEFORE THE BLACKOUT,

01:40.171 --> 01:42.673
THE WINDOW WASHER
LIVED HIS LIFE

01:42.673 --> 01:44.775
IGNORING THE QUESTIONS
OF THE FUTURE.

01:44.775 --> 01:47.308
THEY JUST WEREN'T
THAT IMPORTANT TO HIM,

01:47.308 --> 01:49.410
SO HE BELIEVED NOTHING.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.542
BUT THE BLACKOUT CAME...

01:53.284 --> 01:56.817
AND THIS MAN FACED
CERTAIN DEATH.

01:59.550 --> 02:02.393
(loud explosion in distance)

02:02.393 --> 02:05.396
(airplane engine roars,
car alarms wail)

02:05.396 --> 02:08.128
(tires screech)

02:09.300 --> 02:11.332
MANY OF US THINK

02:11.332 --> 02:13.734
THAT WHEN DIVINE INTERVENTION
HAPPENS,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.267
IT'S SOMETHING BIG.

02:16.267 --> 02:18.809
BUT IT CAN ALSO BE
A SMALL THING

02:18.809 --> 02:22.343
THAT SEEMS SO INCONSEQUENTIAL
IN THE MOMENT...

02:24.275 --> 02:25.746
TURNS OUT TO BE

02:25.746 --> 02:29.149
THE TURNING POINT
FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.521
(clank)

02:30.521 --> 02:33.254
(scaffolding creaks)

02:33.254 --> 02:34.655
(helicopter whirring)

02:42.593 --> 02:44.665
BIG OR SMALL,

02:44.665 --> 02:48.369
WHAT IF THAT MOMENT
AFFECTED EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE

02:48.369 --> 02:51.672
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME?

02:51.672 --> 02:54.605
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN TO YOU?

02:54.605 --> 02:59.510
WHERE WOULD YOU LOOK
FOR ANSWERS?

02:59.510 --> 03:03.814
THE ANSWER IS NEVER
ABOUT JUST ONE PERSON.

03:03.814 --> 03:08.559
EVERY SINGLE PERSON'S LIFE
WAS TOUCHED BY THE BLACKOUT.

03:08.559 --> 03:12.393
NONE OF US ARE IN THIS ALONE.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.266
(Shanti Shanti's "Beloved Son"
playing)

03:21.402 --> 03:24.735
HELP!

03:24.735 --> 03:27.938
(choir) â™ª STAY WITH ME â™ª

03:27.938 --> 03:31.242
â™ª REMAIN HERE WITH ME â™ª

03:31.242 --> 03:38.819
â™ª WATCH AND PRAY â™ª

03:38.819 --> 03:44.695
â™ª WATCH AND PRAY â™ª

03:44.695 --> 03:47.458
(indistinct shouting
and screaming in distance)

03:47.458 --> 03:49.430
EACH ONE OF US IS UNIQUE.

03:49.430 --> 03:53.304
BUT WE ARE BEING STITCHED
TOGETHER TO FORM A TAPESTRY,

03:53.304 --> 03:55.936
SOMETHING LARGER
THAT CAN'T BE UNDERSTOOD

03:55.936 --> 03:59.239
UNTIL WE STEP BACK
TO SEE THE WHOLE THING...

03:59.239 --> 04:02.343
(shouts indistinctly)
I NEED HELP HERE!

04:02.343 --> 04:06.417
(screams)
AT SOME POINT, WE ALL WAKE UP,

04:06.417 --> 04:08.819
AND THEN WE HAVE TO CHOOSE.

04:08.819 --> 04:11.552
DO WE WALK IN HOPE,

04:11.552 --> 04:14.825
BELIEVING THAT WHAT GOD
IS DOING IS GOOD,

04:14.825 --> 04:16.827
OR DO WE STUMBLE AROUND,

04:16.827 --> 04:19.860
RESIGNING OURSELVES TO CHAOS?

04:19.860 --> 04:22.763
THE WINDOW WASHER SAW
A PATH THROUGH THE CHAOS,

04:22.763 --> 04:26.667
AND HE SAW THE GOOD
IN WHAT HE WAS SHOWN.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.440
THAT WINDOW WASHER...

04:29.440 --> 04:37.978
WAS ME.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.982
(siren wailing)

04:41.982 --> 04:45.015
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS PEOPLE
HAVE ALWAYS STRUGGLED WITH.

04:45.015 --> 04:49.360
ONLY NOW, THEY ARE
MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER.

04:51.662 --> 04:53.364
(beep)

04:55.896 --> 04:58.469
TAKE ME THROUGH
SOMETHING HERE.

04:58.469 --> 05:00.631
YOU'RE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY

05:00.631 --> 05:02.833
AGAINST MY EXPRESSED WISHES,

05:02.833 --> 05:06.377
AND YOU DECIDE TO PULL
A GUN IN A PUBLIC PLACE.

05:06.377 --> 05:08.479
(grunts)

05:08.479 --> 05:11.512
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

05:11.512 --> 05:13.684
BACK OFF! BACK OFF NOW!

05:13.684 --> 05:17.848
CAN I GO SEE MY WIFE?
SHE WAS JUST NEARLY KIDNAPPED.

05:17.848 --> 05:21.492
WHAT... WERE...
YOU THINKING?

05:21.492 --> 05:25.055
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

05:25.055 --> 05:27.398
CAN YOU TRY TO TELL US
WHAT YOU SAW?

05:27.398 --> 05:29.430
UH, YEAH.
I WAS SAYING GOOD-BYE.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.062
DYLAN SIMCOE'S BEEN
A PATIENT OF MINE FOR A WHILE.

05:32.062 --> 05:34.605
UM, THE PARAMEDICS
WERE LOADING HIM IN.

05:34.605 --> 05:37.067
AND THAT'S WHEN I NOTICED...
HEY!

05:37.067 --> 05:39.370
(Dylan) NO AMBO!
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

05:39.370 --> 05:42.373
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
WELL, THEY WEREN'T PARAMEDICS.

05:42.373 --> 05:45.576
I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
BILL, CAN YOU GET DOWN HERE?

05:45.576 --> 05:47.878
WHO'S BILL?
OH, THE SECURITY GUARD.

05:49.620 --> 05:52.383
THEY SHOT HIM.

05:52.383 --> 05:54.585
THEY SHOT HIM.
THEY JUST DID IT.

05:54.585 --> 05:57.858
AND THEN THEY
TURNED THE GUN AT ME.
NO, NO, NO! PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE DON'T HURT HER.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.892
AND THAT'S WHEN MARK JUMPED IN
AND GOT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.
MARK?

06:01.892 --> 06:05.095
LLOYD.

06:05.095 --> 06:07.398
SORRY. TIRED.

06:07.398 --> 06:10.671
LLOYD SIMCOE.
HE TOLD THEM NOT TO HURT ME

06:10.671 --> 06:13.804
AND THAT HE'D GO WITH THEM.

06:13.804 --> 06:17.077
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

06:17.077 --> 06:20.511
SOME STRANGER TELLS ME I'M GONNA
PUT THREE BULLETS IN MY FRIEND.

06:20.511 --> 06:22.813
I'M NOT GONNA INVITE HER
TO A TEA PARTY.

06:22.813 --> 06:25.416
ARE YOU TRYING TO BE CUTE?
AT LEAST I'M NOT SITTING
ON MY HANDS.

06:25.416 --> 06:27.418
WE STILL HAVEN'T
GONE TO SOMALIA.

06:27.418 --> 06:30.390
WE CAN'T FIND D. GIBBONS,
AND FOR SOME REASON,

06:30.390 --> 06:32.162
WE'RE NOT USING
EVERY RESOURCE AVAILABLE

06:32.162 --> 06:35.866
TO US TO FIND OUT
WHO THE HELL SUSPECT ZERO IS.

06:35.866 --> 06:40.030
SOMALIA IS A WAR ZONE,
AND I'M WORKING TO GET US IN.

06:40.030 --> 06:42.673
THE DETROIT BUREAU
IS CANVASSING MICHIGAN

06:42.673 --> 06:45.075
LOOKING FOR SUSPECT ZERO,
AND WE'VE GOT GIBBONS

06:45.075 --> 06:47.037
ON THE TEN MOST WANTED LIST,

06:47.037 --> 06:49.009
WHICH IS MORE THAN
A MIRACLE TO PULL OFF.

06:49.009 --> 06:53.183
SO DON'T YOU IMPLY THAT
I'M NOT WORKING WITH YOU HERE.

06:53.183 --> 06:55.846
ARE YOU GONNA FIND LLOYD?

06:55.846 --> 06:59.750
THIS ONLY HAPPENED
'CAUSE HE CAME FORWARD,

06:59.750 --> 07:03.193
DID THE RIGHT THING.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.456
PLEASE FIND HIM.

07:06.797 --> 07:09.960
YOUR BUREAU-MANDATED
THERAPIST--

07:09.960 --> 07:13.464
YOU SEE HER THREE TIMES A WEEK,
AND WHEN SHE THINKS

07:13.464 --> 07:16.707
YOU'RE UP TO IT, WE'LL TALK
ABOUT A REINSTATEMENT.

07:20.811 --> 07:23.814
(Radio City featuring Bajka's
"The Hop" playing)

07:34.024 --> 07:37.457
(high-pitched whirring)

07:41.792 --> 07:44.565
â™ª GOING IN MY LAP
AND I PUSH THE CAP â™ª

07:44.565 --> 07:47.467
â™ª AND IN THE DAYS BACK,
CLIMBING UP, CLOSE MY CAP â™ª

07:47.467 --> 07:49.840
â™ª TANGO REAL NICE
IN THE BACK C.P. â™ª

07:49.840 --> 07:51.902
â™ª 'CAUSE WE WILL
ROLL THE TOP DOWN â™ª

07:51.902 --> 07:54.545
â™ª IT'S A FLY ON THE STREET â™ª

07:54.545 --> 07:57.808
â™ª IT'S A FLY ON THE STREET â™ª

08:01.552 --> 08:03.053
(tapping)

08:03.053 --> 08:05.215
EXCUSE ME!

08:07.487 --> 08:10.791
I KNOW AMERICA WAS A COUNTRY
FOUNDED BY PURITANS,

08:10.791 --> 08:14.525
BUT IS THERE REALLY NOT A SINGLE
BEER IN THIS ENTIRE PLACE?

08:14.525 --> 08:17.227
I THINK YOU GOT US
CONFUSED WITH THE A.T.F.,

08:17.227 --> 08:18.829
DR. CAMPOS.

08:18.829 --> 08:22.132
WHAT IS IT
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

08:22.132 --> 08:24.675
I'M ADVISING THE OFFICE
ON ALL THINGS SCIENTIFIC

08:24.675 --> 08:27.738
RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION.

08:30.140 --> 08:32.142
VERY SCIENTIFIC.

08:32.142 --> 08:34.815
THAT IS CLASSIFIED.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.147
NOT TO ME.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.598
(Olivia) MARK?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.261
(exhales deeply)

09:16.226 --> 09:18.228
I CAN SEE WORKING
FOR THE FBI

09:18.228 --> 09:21.191
IS GONNA BE MUCH MORE
INTERESTING THAN ACADEMIA.

09:21.191 --> 09:24.194
MARK, IT'S NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
(whispers) SHH. NOT NOW.

09:24.194 --> 09:26.196
(normal voice)
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

09:26.196 --> 09:30.701
THIS CAN WAIT TILL LATER.
(whispers) LET'S GO HOME.

09:30.701 --> 09:32.342
(whispers) YEAH.

09:36.246 --> 09:38.208
BYE-BYE.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.952
IT'S BEEN EIGHT HOURS
SINCE SIMCOE WAS KIDNAPPED.

09:41.952 --> 09:44.254
WHERE ARE WE?
WE KNOW IT WAS
A PROFESSIONAL JOB,

09:44.254 --> 09:47.157
BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN
ANY KIND OF RANSOM DEMAND.

09:47.157 --> 09:49.289
WE CAN ONLY THEORIZE
AS TO WHY HE'S BEEN TAKEN,

09:49.289 --> 09:53.093
BUT CONSIDERING HOW MANY
PEOPLE WANT HIM DEAD--
COULD BE ANYONE.

09:54.965 --> 09:58.799
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
NICE TO SEE YOU,
TOO, AGENT NOH.

09:58.799 --> 10:02.833
AGENT VOGEL HAS OFFICIALLY
JOINED THE MOSAIC TASK FORCE.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.374
EMBRACE IT, DEMETRI.

10:04.374 --> 10:07.277
THIS IS NOW
AN INTERAGENCY INVESTIGATION.

10:07.277 --> 10:10.180
I'VE ASKED DR. CAMPOS
TO BE HERE.

10:10.180 --> 10:13.113
HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATION
TO SIMCOE SHOULD BE ABLE

10:13.113 --> 10:15.385
TO SHED SOME LIGHT
ON OUR KIDNAPPERS.

10:15.385 --> 10:17.387
I SUGGEST WE CAST A WIDER NET--

10:17.387 --> 10:21.221
TERRORISTS, ANYONE INTERESTED
IN FUTURE FORECASTING.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.224
IF SOMEONE WERE ABLE TO MASTER
THE FLASH-FORWARDS,

10:24.224 --> 10:26.296
THEY WOULD BE EFFECTIVELY
PRINTING THEIR OWN MONEY.

10:26.296 --> 10:29.660
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT THE MIND OF LLOYD SIMCOE

10:29.660 --> 10:31.131
IS A PRICELESS RESOURCE.

10:39.109 --> 10:40.941
(Lloyd) HELP!

10:40.941 --> 10:42.412
HELP!

10:44.344 --> 10:48.648
CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.351
(door opens and closes)

10:51.351 --> 10:53.724
(man) NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU.

11:08.739 --> 11:12.172
YOU'RE DEHYDRATED. YOU SHOULD
REPLENISH YOUR ELECTROLYTES.

11:16.707 --> 11:19.209
YOU TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO KNOW,

11:19.209 --> 11:22.883
AND YOU CAN WALK OUT
OF HERE RIGHT NOW.
WHO ARE YOU?

11:22.883 --> 11:26.016
YOU ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.

11:26.016 --> 11:29.219
GO TO HELL.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HELL IS,

11:29.219 --> 11:32.322
BUT I GUESS
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

11:43.433 --> 11:45.435
FROM THE OUTSIDE,

11:45.435 --> 11:48.138
I LOOKED THE SAME
AFTER THE BLACKOUT.

11:48.138 --> 11:51.481
BUT INSIDE, I WAS DIFFERENT.

11:51.481 --> 11:53.884
(dog barking)

11:53.884 --> 11:55.345
WE'VE LIVED BELIEVING

11:55.345 --> 11:58.218
NOT KNOWING THE FUTURE
MADE LIFE DIFFICULT.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.952
THE TRUTH IS
THAT IT'S VASTLY MORE DIFFICULT

12:01.952 --> 12:04.254
KNOWING WHAT LIES BEFORE US.

12:07.898 --> 12:10.901
"BUT OF THE TREE OF
THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL,

12:10.901 --> 12:12.903
"YOU SHALL NOT EAT,

12:12.903 --> 12:16.767
"FOR IN THE DAY
THAT YOU EAT OF IT,

12:16.767 --> 12:19.439
YOU SHALL SURELY DIE."

12:19.439 --> 12:20.971
HMM.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.818
(smoke detector blaring)

12:27.818 --> 12:29.780
(Nicole) MOM?

12:29.780 --> 12:31.181
MOM?

12:32.522 --> 12:35.425
MOM!

12:35.425 --> 12:37.287
(sighs)

12:37.287 --> 12:40.090
WHY WOULD YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

12:40.090 --> 12:42.893
YOU COULD HAVE BURNED
THE WHOLE HOUSE DOWN!

12:44.965 --> 12:46.967
(blaring stops)

12:51.271 --> 12:53.473
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

12:57.477 --> 13:00.510
SORRY.
WHATEVER. SHE'S HAD BREAKFAST.

13:00.510 --> 13:04.254
THE NANNY WAS LATE.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SAY
YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE,

13:04.254 --> 13:06.917
I NEED YOU TO BE HERE.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.859
SHE BURNED THE BIBLE
THIS MORNING.

13:08.859 --> 13:12.492
WHAT?
MIGHT WANT TO SEARCH THE HOUSE
AGAIN FOR MATCHES OR A LIGHTER.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.825
WHATEVER.
THE FAMILY BIBLE?

13:14.825 --> 13:17.067
(sighs) MOM!

13:17.067 --> 13:23.273
THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS TO FIND
THE GIFT IN WHAT WE SAW.

13:23.273 --> 13:25.275
WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE IT
AT FIRST,

13:25.275 --> 13:29.339
BUT IF WE PAY ATTENTION,
IT WILL REVEAL ITSELF.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.518
WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA DO?

13:38.518 --> 13:42.322
CHARLIE'S AT SCHOOL, AND IT'S
NOT LIKE I PLAY ANY GOLF.

13:44.855 --> 13:47.397
WE DIDN'T GET
TO TALK LAST NIGHT,

13:47.397 --> 13:50.300
AND I DON'T WANT
TO NOT TALK.

13:50.300 --> 13:55.305
I WAS SAYING GOOD-BYE
TO LLOYD.

13:55.305 --> 13:57.267
BUT WHAT YOU SAW
IN THAT VIDEOTAPE--

13:57.267 --> 13:59.569
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ENDING.

13:59.569 --> 14:03.573
I SWEAR TO GOD, IT MADE ME
HAPPY TO THINK IT WAS OVER.
I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

14:09.419 --> 14:12.282
THAT'S THE THING. I'M NOT.

14:12.282 --> 14:15.285
I HAVEN'T BEEN FOR A WHILE.

14:15.285 --> 14:17.457
AT WORK I'M COLD
AND I'M DISTANT,

14:17.457 --> 14:21.261
AND THEN I COME HOME,
AND YOU AND I--
I HAVEN'T BEEN THE EASIEST GUY
TO COME HOME TO.

14:21.261 --> 14:25.035
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

14:26.636 --> 14:30.340
WHAT IF WE JUST RAN?

14:30.340 --> 14:33.043
WHAT IF WE JUST
UPPED AND MOVED AWAY?
(chuckles)

14:33.043 --> 14:36.106
NO, I MEAN IT. I MEAN,
EVERYTHING BAD WE SAW

14:36.106 --> 14:38.308
WAS HERE IN L.A.
YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?

14:38.308 --> 14:40.650
AL GOUGH JUMPED OFF A BUILDING
TO SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE--

14:40.650 --> 14:43.083
A WOMAN HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.

14:43.083 --> 14:47.087
THERE'S NOTHING I WOULDN'T DO
TO SAVE OUR MARRIAGE.

14:47.087 --> 14:51.291
COME HERE.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.471
(woman) 9-1-1.
(man) There's a homeless man.
He's vomiting.

15:01.471 --> 15:04.274
He looks like he needs help.
838 Bauchet Street,

15:04.274 --> 15:07.337
by the train yards.
Are you with the victim now,
sir?

15:07.337 --> 15:10.310
THE CALL'S A HOAX.
REAL E.M.T.s RESPONDED,

15:10.310 --> 15:14.144
BAD GUYS SWAPPED THEMSELVES IN.
THE AMBULANCE COMPANY
SUPPLIED US WITH THIS,

15:14.144 --> 15:16.616
AND ASIDE FROM THE VIDEOTAPE,
IT'S THE ONLY LEAD WE HAVE

15:16.616 --> 15:19.619
ON THE KIDNAPPING.
HAVE YOU FOUND
THE MISSING E.M.T.s?

15:19.619 --> 15:22.452
WE SENT L.A.P.D. DETECTIVES
TO THAT LOCATION.

15:22.452 --> 15:25.555
DEAD END. IT'S JUST AN EMPTY
RAIL YARD SOUTH OF DOWNTOWN.

15:25.555 --> 15:28.928
AND WE HAVEN'T LOCATED
THE AMBULANCE, EITHER.
YOU OUTSOURCED THIS

15:28.928 --> 15:30.930
TO THE LOS ANGELES
POLICE DEPARTMENT?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.003
IT'S A LOCAL CRIME--
THAT INVOLVES
OUR INVESTIGATION.

15:33.003 --> 15:36.506
WHAT ABOUT LLOYD'S LAPTOP?
WHAT ABOUT IT?

15:36.506 --> 15:40.340
WELL, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO BREAK
THROUGH THE ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE,

15:40.340 --> 15:43.373
SEE WHO HE WAS IN CONTACT WITH
BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN.

15:43.373 --> 15:46.946
COULD HELP.
JANIS, TAKE A SECURITY TEAM.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.648
ESCORT DR. CAMPOS
TO THE SIMCOE HOUSE.

15:48.648 --> 15:52.422
I WANT TO TALK TO THE DETECTIVES
WHO CANVASSED THAT CRIME SCENE.

15:52.422 --> 15:55.185
THANK YOU.
(door opens)

15:55.185 --> 15:56.356
(door closes)

15:58.658 --> 16:01.231
IS THIS, UH, SUITE 520?

16:01.231 --> 16:04.094
UH-HUH,
AND YOU'RE MY 3:00.

16:04.094 --> 16:07.097
THEN WHY DOES IT LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE LEAVING?

16:07.097 --> 16:10.000
'CAUSE IT'S 3:00, AND IF I
DON'T GET AN ICED LATTE STAT,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.302
I'M GONNA NEED THERAPY.

16:12.302 --> 16:14.304
AGENT BENFORD,
FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS,

16:14.304 --> 16:16.306
MY JOB HAS BEEN
TO HELP PEOPLE COPE

16:16.306 --> 16:19.049
BY HELPING THEM
EXPLORE THEIR PAST.

16:19.049 --> 16:21.311
BUT SINCE THE BLACKOUT,
THAT'S ALL CHANGED.

16:21.311 --> 16:24.214
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
WHO ARE COMING TO SEE ME

16:24.214 --> 16:27.117
ARE DEALING WITH TRAUMAS
FROM THEIR FUTURE.

16:27.117 --> 16:29.219
SO TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.

16:29.219 --> 16:32.992
I SAW MYSELF OFF THE WAGON
WITH GUNS POINTED AT ME.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.366
WHAT ELSE DO YOU REMEMBER?
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TRAUMA
FOR YOU?

16:36.366 --> 16:39.699
I'VE SEEN YOUR FILES.
YOU'VE GOT A GOD COMPLEX.

16:39.699 --> 16:43.533
I BELIEVE THAT YOU SAW
SOMETHING IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD,

16:43.533 --> 16:46.106
SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT
NOT EVEN BE CONSCIOUS OF,

16:46.106 --> 16:49.179
THAT'S MAKING YOU BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE THE CENTER

16:49.179 --> 16:51.581
OF THE UNIVERSE,
AND I'M NOT SIGNING ANYTHING

16:51.581 --> 16:53.643
UNTIL WE FIND OUT
WHAT THAT IS.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.018
(whoosh)

17:14.734 --> 17:17.667
NEXT THING I KNEW,
I WAS UPSIDE DOWN,

17:17.667 --> 17:21.241
STARING AT A BROKEN WINDSHIELD
AND A BUNCH OF ORANGES

17:21.241 --> 17:25.044
ON THE 110.
OKAY, BY MY MATH,
THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY ADD UP

17:25.044 --> 17:27.347
TO 2 MINUTES AND 17 SECONDS.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.180
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON
TO POINT THAT OUT.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.252
AND YOU WERE DRINKING?

17:34.254 --> 17:36.386
CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
HALF OF IT.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.088
DO YOU WANT TO?

17:38.088 --> 17:40.460
'CAUSE THERE HAS BEEN
SOME SUCCESS

17:40.460 --> 17:42.832
USING A MODIFIED
CALCINEURIN INHIBITOR

17:42.832 --> 17:45.665
TO ENHANCE PEOPLE'S MEMORIES
OF THEIR FLASH-FORWARDS.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.737
USING A DRUG
TO ENHANCE MEMORIES.

17:47.737 --> 17:51.201
EH, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK
A MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

17:51.201 --> 17:55.205
IS THE BEST WAY TO GO
FOR SOMEONE IN RECOVERY.
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

17:55.205 --> 17:57.247
NOT MUCH.
IN CASE YOU FORGOT,

17:57.247 --> 18:00.710
I CHASE DOWN VERY BAD PEOPLE
FOR A LIVING.
NOT ANYMORE YOU DON'T.

18:02.712 --> 18:05.215
CALL ME WHEN YOU WANT
TO CONTINUE TREATMENT.

18:05.215 --> 18:07.217
I'D BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

18:24.234 --> 18:26.336
(typing)

18:26.336 --> 18:28.238
(beep)

18:28.238 --> 18:31.511
YOU GO TO THE ALLEY.
GUARD THE BACK DOOR.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.516
COULD YOU GET ME A BEER

18:36.516 --> 18:38.788
FROM THE REFRIGERATOR,
PLEASE?

18:38.788 --> 18:42.852
WE'RE HERE AS YOUR SECURITY,
MR. CAMPOS, NOT YOUR SERVANTS.

18:42.852 --> 18:45.355
I'M TRYING TO BRUTE FORCE
AN ENCRYPTION HERE.

18:45.355 --> 18:47.557
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET UP.

18:47.557 --> 18:50.700
I HAVE EVEN LESS TIME FOR
EXPLICATING WHY SAID REQUEST

18:50.700 --> 18:55.205
SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. SO WHY DON'T
YOU TODDLE OFF, GET ME A BEER?

18:55.205 --> 18:58.868
IT'LL HELP ME COGITATE.
THAT MEANS "THINK."

18:58.868 --> 19:04.214
THAT'S A BIG WORD
FOR SUCH A LITTLE MAN.

19:04.214 --> 19:06.416
I'M WOUNDED.

19:06.416 --> 19:09.219
BUT I STILL WANT MY BEER.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.195
(bottles clink)

19:35.505 --> 19:37.447
(Demetri) JANIS!

19:37.447 --> 19:39.879
GET HER ON HER SIDE.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.652
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
(siren wailing)

19:42.652 --> 19:44.714
TAKE IT EASY.

19:44.714 --> 19:48.418
WHERE'S SIMON?
HE'S GONE.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE.

19:48.418 --> 19:52.462
WHAT HAPPENED?
THERE WERE TWO GUYS
WEARING MASKS...

19:52.462 --> 19:55.325
JUST LIKE THE ONES
ON MARK'S BOARD.

19:55.325 --> 19:57.297
(helicopter whirring)

19:57.297 --> 19:58.768
(door opens)

19:58.768 --> 20:01.471
(grunting)

20:01.471 --> 20:03.973
(door creaks)
(moans)

20:03.973 --> 20:06.906
(grunts)

20:15.585 --> 20:17.917
(grunts)

20:22.752 --> 20:25.855
GOOD.

20:25.855 --> 20:27.657
I FOUND YOU.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.332
(Bryce) BUT HIS FATHER'S
BEEN KIDNAPPED.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.934
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S GONNA
LIVE ON THE STREET.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.607
SOCIAL SERVICES WILL TAKE
GOOD CARE OF HIM.
THIS IS MY PATIENT.
YOU CAN'T RELEASE HIM.

20:37.607 --> 20:40.410
YOU SIGNED
THE FORMS YESTERDAY.

20:40.410 --> 20:43.313
WE KEPT HIM OVERNIGHT
AS A COURTESY, BUT COME ON.

20:43.313 --> 20:45.915
WE NEEDS THE BEDS.
YEAH, BUT HE'S DEVELOPED
A COMPLICATION.

20:45.915 --> 20:48.548
HIS CLOT GOT WORSE.
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU HAD X-RAY VISION.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.550
WELL, GUESS WE CAN
CLOSE DOWN RADIOLOGY.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.882
DYLAN, COME HERE A SECOND.

20:52.882 --> 20:54.554
DYLAN?

20:54.554 --> 20:57.827
HEY, BABE?

20:57.827 --> 20:59.989
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.
DYLAN?

20:59.989 --> 21:03.563
HEY, HEY.
DYLAN, SWEETIE?

21:06.596 --> 21:10.470
â™ª THE BOOK HURLED
AND SWIRLED â™ª

21:10.470 --> 21:13.002
â™ª THEM INTO SQUIRRLYWORLD â™ª

21:13.002 --> 21:15.875
â™ª TO FIGHT FINNEGAN
THE SUPERSHARK â™ª

21:15.875 --> 21:18.408
â™ª AND LIVE OUT
TIM TIM'S WORDS â™ª

21:18.408 --> 21:20.950
â™ª OH, WHO KNOWS
IF THE STORIES WILL GO â™ª

21:20.950 --> 21:23.453
â™ª HOW TIM TIM MADE 'EM GO? â™ª

21:23.453 --> 21:25.615
â™ª I GUESS WE'LL
JUST HAVE TO WATCH â™ª

21:25.615 --> 21:27.987
â™ª "THE TIM TIM
AND SQUIRRLIO SHOW" â™ª

21:27.987 --> 21:30.790
THAT'S RIGHT.
â™ª I GUESS YOU'LL JUST â™ª

21:30.790 --> 21:35.365
â™ª HAVE TO WATCH "THE TIM TIM
AND SQUIRRLIO SHOW" â™ª
â™ª HAVE TO WATCH "THE TIM TIM
AND SQUIRRLIO SHOW" â™ª

21:35.365 --> 21:39.429
(both) â™ª "TIM TIM
AND SQUIRRLIO SHOW" â™ª

21:39.429 --> 21:43.072
â™ª "TIM TIM
AND SQUIRRLIO SHOW" â™ª
â™ª "AND SQUIRRLIO SHOW" â™ª

21:43.072 --> 21:46.536
YEAH, ELEVATED HEART RATE,
SHORTNESS OF BREATH

21:46.536 --> 21:49.779
AND, UH, WARM FOREHEAD.
COULD BE SEPSIS.

21:55.345 --> 22:00.520
ARE THEY GONNA FIND MY DADDY,
OLIVIA?

22:00.520 --> 22:02.652
YEAH.

22:02.652 --> 22:05.655
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

22:10.059 --> 22:12.602
OH, YEAH. LIKE WE'RE GONNA
FIND AN AMBULANCE OUT HERE

22:12.602 --> 22:14.604
THAT THE L.A.P.D.
COULDN'T FIND.

22:14.604 --> 22:18.408
GOOD CALL. THIS WAS DEFINITELY
NOT A WASTE OF TIME.

22:18.408 --> 22:20.870
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

22:20.870 --> 22:23.573
WHY DON'T WE, UH, TAKE OUT
OUR GUNS AND WAVE 'EM AROUND?
(train horn blares)

22:23.573 --> 22:26.546
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
LISTEN, WHAT HAPPENED
IN HONG KONG--

22:26.546 --> 22:29.779
SHOULD STAY IN HONG KONG?
I WAS FOLLOWING A LEAD
ON MY OWN MURDER.

22:29.779 --> 22:32.121
I KNOW, BUT THE THING YOU
AND BENFORD SCREWED UP

22:32.121 --> 22:34.454
OVER THERE IS SO MUCH BIGGER
THAN WHO MIGHT

22:34.454 --> 22:37.126
PUT 3 BULLETS IN YOU
ON MARCH 15th.
FOR YOU, MAYBE.

22:37.126 --> 22:39.659
COME ON. DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

22:39.659 --> 22:42.061
WHO DIDN'T HAVE
A FLASH-FORWARD,

22:42.061 --> 22:43.793
WHO SAW SOMETHING, UH,
THEY WISH THEY HADN'T?

22:43.793 --> 22:47.096
TAKE SOME ADVICE. YOU CAN CRY.
YOU CAN LIE TO YOUR FIANCÃ©E.

22:47.096 --> 22:49.769
WHATEVER. BUT SOONER OR LATER
YOU BETTER GET IT TOGETHER,

22:49.769 --> 22:52.902
OR ELSE SHE'S GONNA BE...
WALKIN' ALONG THAT BEACH

22:52.902 --> 22:55.975
GETTING READY TO MARRY
SOMEBODY ELSE.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.109
(grunts)

23:00.109 --> 23:02.412
DON'T BE STUPID.
(spits)

23:02.412 --> 23:05.154
THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND YOU
WHO KNOW THINGS YOU DON'T.

23:05.154 --> 23:09.158
(grunts)
IF YOU WANT TO AVOID
BEING KILLED,

23:09.158 --> 23:11.421
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A BETTER PARTNER--

23:11.421 --> 23:13.392
BETTER THAN MARK BENFORD.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.995
(flies buzzing)

23:19.168 --> 23:22.101
(buzzing continues)

23:27.637 --> 23:30.139
WHAT WAS THAT
ABOUT A WASTE OF TIME?

23:30.139 --> 23:31.641
(beep)

23:32.982 --> 23:35.114
(telephones ringing)
HEY.

23:35.114 --> 23:39.118
I AM SO GLAD TO SEE
YOUR SHINING FACE.
REALLY?

23:39.118 --> 23:43.122
YEP. MR. MICHALSKI
JUST WOKE UP FROM SURGERY,

23:43.122 --> 23:46.125
AND WE NEED SOMEONE
TO CHECK ON HIM.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.958
HAPPY TO.
THANKS.

23:54.864 --> 23:56.466
(whoosh)

23:56.466 --> 23:58.608
(muffled screaming)

24:04.574 --> 24:06.175
UH, WAIT!

24:06.175 --> 24:10.119
EXCUSE ME. HEY! HEY.

24:10.119 --> 24:13.182
OH, I'M--I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT--
THOUGHT YOU WERE SOMEONE ELSE.

24:13.182 --> 24:16.055
SORRY.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.043
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD
I ONLY SAW HIM FOR A SECOND,

24:34.043 --> 24:37.246
BUT I'M SURE IT WAS HIM.
WELL, I GAVE HIS DESCRIPTION
TO SECURITY.

24:37.246 --> 24:41.180
I REALLY WANT YOU TO CALL THAT
DETECTIVE FRIEND OF MARK'S.
DETECTIVE LIEFELD.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.713
NO, I GAVE HIM A DESCRIPTION
TWO MONTHS AGO.

24:43.713 --> 24:48.117
I MEAN, THIS WON'T BE
ANYTHING NEW.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN HELP.
YOU SHOULD CALL HIM.

24:48.117 --> 24:50.820
OKAY.
(pager beeps)

24:50.820 --> 24:54.123
OOH. E.R. OKAY.
UH, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

24:54.123 --> 24:57.096
HEY,
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.198
OKAY?

25:01.671 --> 25:05.004
OH, I KEEP TRYING TO CONVINCE
MYSELF THAT THIS IS A MISTAKE--

25:05.004 --> 25:08.007
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.179
BUT I-I CAN'T KEEP
WALKING AROUND WONDERING

25:10.179 --> 25:13.182
IF THIS GUY'S GONNA BE
BEHIND EVERY CORNER.

25:13.182 --> 25:15.214
HAVE YOU HEARD
ABOUT SANCTUARY?

25:15.214 --> 25:19.949
UM, LET ME SHOW YOU.
I PUT THESE UP EVERYWHERE.

25:19.949 --> 25:21.250
HERE.

25:21.250 --> 25:24.123
YEAH, I'VE SEEN THESE.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.696
THE GUY WHO LEADS IT SEES THINGS
IN A REALLY POSITIVE WAY.

25:26.696 --> 25:29.629
YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

25:29.629 --> 25:33.703
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
WHETHER YOU WERE FRIGHTENED

25:33.703 --> 25:35.635
BY WHAT YOU SAW OR EXCITED.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.607
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT

25:37.607 --> 25:40.670
I WAS TOTALLY CONFUSED
BY MY FLASH-FORWARD.

25:40.670 --> 25:43.542
(whoosh)

25:45.544 --> 25:48.848
I WASN'T A RELIGIOUS PERSON
AT ALL.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.820
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

25:50.820 --> 25:54.023
BUT A VOICE SAID,
"JUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD."

25:54.023 --> 25:57.887
SO I CREATED SANCTUARY...

25:57.887 --> 26:00.229
A PLACE WHERE WE CAN BE SAFE,

26:00.229 --> 26:02.732
WERE THERE IS NO THREAT,

26:02.732 --> 26:04.734
NO DANGER.

26:06.295 --> 26:08.798
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE AFTER?

26:08.798 --> 26:13.272
IT'S THE EXPERIMENT AT N.L.A.P.
IT'S GOTTA BE.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.574
AND CLEARLY,
I DIDN'T CONSIDER

26:15.574 --> 26:18.177
THE REPERCUSSIONS
OF OUR ANNOUNCEMENT.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.579
YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT, LLOYD.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.152
I SHOULDN'T HAVE IMPLICATED YOU
AND THE REST OF THE STAFF.

26:23.152 --> 26:25.885
OH, SPARE ME YOUR WHINGING,
LLOYD.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.287
I WAS CO-DIRECTOR
OF THE PROJECT.

26:28.287 --> 26:31.120
I WAS ON THE HOOK THE MOMENT
YOU OPENED YOUR MOUTH,

26:31.120 --> 26:34.063
AND AS I'VE SAID REPEATEDLY,
I DO NOT THINK WE WERE

26:34.063 --> 26:39.368
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BLACKOUT.
YEAH, WELL, IT WOULD SEEM
OUR CAPTORS WOULD BEG TO DIFFER.

26:39.368 --> 26:42.171
YES. WE DO BEG TO DIFFER.

26:42.171 --> 26:44.704
(door creaks open)

26:47.206 --> 26:50.810
(door closes)

26:52.211 --> 26:53.643
SIT, PLEASE.

26:57.286 --> 27:00.319
(clink)

27:00.319 --> 27:03.352
I HAVE EMPHYSEMA.

27:03.352 --> 27:07.096
I CONTRACTED IT THROUGH
YEARS OF HABITUAL SMOKING.

27:07.096 --> 27:09.729
DISGUSTING PROCLIVITY,
ISN'T IT?

27:09.729 --> 27:13.202
ONLY VILLAINS SMOKE.
WE KNOW THIS, RIGHT?

27:13.202 --> 27:17.006
I'M SORRY. YOU ARE...

27:18.237 --> 27:21.270
(spits)
(grunts)

27:21.270 --> 27:22.641
AAH!

27:22.641 --> 27:25.144
YOU MAY CALL ME FLOSSO.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.116
(grunts)

27:27.116 --> 27:29.148
AND I'M A VILLAIN.

27:39.959 --> 27:43.262
IMAGINE... A BASKET

27:43.262 --> 27:46.065
THE SIZE OF MONTANA.

27:46.065 --> 27:49.969
NOW IMAGINE SAID BASKET
IS FILLED WITH MONEY.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.001
THAT IS WHAT MY EMPLOYERS
ARE PAYING ME

27:52.001 --> 27:54.774
TO ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.846
SO AT 11:00 A.M.
ON OCTOBER 6th,

27:56.846 --> 28:01.010
YOU CONDUCTED A PROTON-DRIVEN
PLASMA-WAKEFIELD EXPERIMENT.

28:01.010 --> 28:03.883
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING
THAT YOU WERE SEARCHING

28:03.883 --> 28:06.155
FOR TACHYONIC DARK MATTER.

28:06.155 --> 28:08.217
IN THE RESULTING
PARTICLE COLLISION,

28:08.217 --> 28:10.920
HOW MUCH COLLISION ENERGY
WAS GENERATED?

28:10.920 --> 28:14.093
I-I DON'T KNOW.
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
A BILLION ELECTRON VOLTS?

28:14.093 --> 28:18.267
I DON'T KNOW.
HOW MANY ELECTRON VOLTS
WERE GENERATED?

28:18.267 --> 28:22.371
PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
WITH YOUR INQUIRY.

28:24.033 --> 28:27.176
OHH! (grunts)
ON OCTOBER 6th,

28:27.176 --> 28:29.708
YOU WERE IN TORONTO
BURYING YOUR FATHER, I BELIEVE.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.381
I'M ASKING THE MAN WHO
ACTUALLY PUSHED THE BUTTON.

28:32.381 --> 28:35.484
YOU'RE HERE
FOR A DIFFERENT REASON.

28:35.484 --> 28:38.788
SO HOW MANY ELECTRON VOLTS
WERE GENERATED?

28:38.788 --> 28:41.851
I'D RATHER DIE THAN TELL YOU HOW
TO MANUFACTURE ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

28:41.851 --> 28:44.954
YOU THINK YOU CAUSED IT?
I DID.

28:44.954 --> 28:47.957
NO, DR. SIMCOE. ALL THE TWO
OF YOU DID WAS AMPLIFY IT.

28:47.957 --> 28:51.230
SO AGAIN,

28:51.230 --> 28:54.333
HOW MANY ELECTRON VOLTS?

28:57.767 --> 29:00.770
(indistinct conversations)

29:00.770 --> 29:02.241
(siren wailing)

29:02.241 --> 29:05.514
WHAT YOU GOT?
NO WOUNDS, NO LIGATURE MARKS,

29:05.514 --> 29:08.047
SO I'M GOING WITH
A POISON OF SOME KIND.

29:08.047 --> 29:11.180
BUT I WON'T KNOW MORE
UNTIL THE TOXOLOGY COMES BACK.

29:11.180 --> 29:14.423
WE FOUND THIS.

29:14.423 --> 29:17.156
MIGHT BELONG TO ONE
OF THE E.M.T.s.

29:17.156 --> 29:20.790
A LEATHER CASE?
FITS A PALM PRE,
BUT WE DIDN'T FIND A PHONE.

29:20.790 --> 29:22.962
IF THE PHONE'S STILL
IN THE AMBULANCE,

29:22.962 --> 29:26.495
WE CAN TRIANGULATE ITS POSITION
FROM ITS SIGNAL.
FIND THE PHONE,
FIND THE AMBULANCE.

29:26.495 --> 29:28.197
FIND THE AMBULANCE, MAYBE FIND
THE GUYS WHO STOLE IT.

29:28.197 --> 29:31.400
FIND THEM, AND THEY'LL
GET US TO SIMON AND LLOYD.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.003
JUST RELAX.

29:34.003 --> 29:36.145
YOU EVER SIT
IN A CHAIR BEFORE?

29:36.145 --> 29:38.307
NOT LIKE THIS ONE, NO.

29:38.307 --> 29:41.080
WELL, SOME PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD
DIFFICULTY RECALLING

29:41.080 --> 29:42.411
THEIR FLASH-FORWARDS

29:42.411 --> 29:45.414
HAVE HAD REAL BREAKTHROUGHS
WITH THIS TREATMENT.

29:45.414 --> 29:48.918
SO HOW ABOUT YOU TELL ME
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

29:48.918 --> 29:50.920
I'M DRIVING EVERYONE
AROUND ME--

29:50.920 --> 29:53.262
EVERYONE I CARE ABOUT--

29:53.262 --> 29:56.996
AWAY...

29:56.996 --> 30:01.971
BECAUSE I CAN'T DEAL
WITH WHAT MY FUTURE MIGHT BE.

30:01.971 --> 30:04.233
WAS THAT REALLY
SO HARD TO SAY?

30:04.233 --> 30:06.936
YOU GOT NO IDEA.

30:10.309 --> 30:14.213
WELL, THERAPY IS
A LOT LIKE A.A.

30:14.213 --> 30:17.046
THE FIRST STEP IN RECOVERY

30:17.046 --> 30:19.989
IS ADMITTING
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

30:19.989 --> 30:22.021
THIS GONNA HURT?

30:22.021 --> 30:23.953
TRUTH ALWAYS DOES
A LITTLE.

30:29.859 --> 30:32.831
THE MAN IN MY FLASH-FORWARD
HAD A NECK LIKE AN OX,

30:32.831 --> 30:35.464
SMELLED LIKE A MEAT LOCKER.

30:35.464 --> 30:40.339
(grunting)
DON'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
OR WHO THE MAN WAS.

30:40.339 --> 30:44.113
I FELT MY THUMBS
ON HIS TRACHEA.

30:44.113 --> 30:49.148
I PUSHED DOWN AS HARD AS I COULD
UNTIL I FELT SOMETHING SNAP.
(snap)

30:49.148 --> 30:51.220
THEN I LET GO.

30:51.220 --> 30:55.524
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE CAPABLE
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

30:55.524 --> 30:59.588
I GUESS MINE'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE VIOLENT THAN YOURS.
I'M CONFUSED.

30:59.588 --> 31:03.292
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD, I...
(whoosh)

31:03.292 --> 31:05.864
I GOT A TEXT MESSAGE FROM YOU.
SORRY,
I HAVE TO MAKE A CALL.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.498
(whoosh)
I CAN'T REMEMBER THAT. I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY I COULDN'T HAVE

31:09.498 --> 31:12.071
SENT YOU A TEXT IN THE MIDDLE
OF WHAT I WAS DOING.

31:12.071 --> 31:15.074
OR MAYBE
I SENT YOU A TEXT EARLIER,

31:15.074 --> 31:18.047
AND YOU JUST RETRIEVED IT THEN.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:18.047 --> 31:20.049
(grunts)
WHY DON'T OUR FUTURES MATCH?

31:20.049 --> 31:22.912
BECAUSE
IT'S A POSSIBLE FUTURE.

31:22.912 --> 31:25.884
CLEARLY, YOU WEREN'T
PAYING ANY ATTENTION

31:25.884 --> 31:31.020
TO THE STORY ABOUT THE FBI AGENT
WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE.

31:32.261 --> 31:34.263
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE...
(grunts)

31:34.263 --> 31:36.926
VISION OR NO VISION.

31:36.926 --> 31:40.399
LLOYD, THAT'S POINTLESS.
THEY'RE WIRE WINDOWS.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.371
THEY'VE PROBABLY
NAILED THEM SHUT ANYWAY.

31:42.371 --> 31:45.274
(muffled voice)
UH-HUH. (grunts)

31:47.506 --> 31:50.679
TOUCHÃ©.

31:50.679 --> 31:53.912
I JUST NEED
ONE PERSON TO WALK BY

31:53.912 --> 31:55.014
AND LOOK DOWN.

31:55.014 --> 31:57.386
(wind gusts)

31:57.386 --> 32:00.389
(Lloyd) NO, NO, NO, NO. WAIT.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! WAIT!

32:00.389 --> 32:02.291
NO!

32:02.291 --> 32:04.223
HELP!

32:04.223 --> 32:06.225
HELP!

32:08.157 --> 32:10.459
(Dr. Langer)
YOU SHOULD START TO FEEL

32:10.459 --> 32:13.432
A TINGLING SENSATION
IN YOUR EXTREMITIES.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.565
THIS IS COMPLETELY NORMAL.
JUST RELAX.

32:16.565 --> 32:19.608
LET THE MEMORIES COME.

32:19.608 --> 32:23.042
(whoosh)

32:46.265 --> 32:49.638
(cell phone rings)

32:49.638 --> 32:51.440
(ring)

32:51.440 --> 32:53.272
(ring)

32:53.272 --> 32:55.274
(ring)

32:55.274 --> 32:57.276
(ring)

32:57.276 --> 32:59.578
WHAT?

32:59.578 --> 33:03.112
I JUST WISH YOU WERE STANDING
BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL

33:03.112 --> 33:05.254
WHEN I CAME CRASHING THROUGH.

33:05.254 --> 33:08.417
GO TO HELL, LLOYD.

33:08.417 --> 33:09.688
(whoosh)

33:13.122 --> 33:14.393
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

33:14.393 --> 33:16.625
I WAS ON THE PHONE.

33:22.371 --> 33:25.074
DO YOU KNOW WHO
YOU WERE TALKING TO?

33:26.305 --> 33:29.478
LLOYD SIMCOE.

33:37.746 --> 33:40.219
(door opens)

33:40.219 --> 33:42.221
(door closes)

33:52.101 --> 33:54.363
YOU DROPPED SOMETHING.

33:54.363 --> 33:57.336
LET'S START AGAIN
FROM THE BEGINNING.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.338
YOU WERE CONDUCTING
AN EXPERIMENT

33:59.338 --> 34:01.210
IN PLASMA-WAKEFIELD
ACCELERATION.

34:01.210 --> 34:04.673
AM I CORRECT
IN THAT ASSUMPTION?

34:04.673 --> 34:08.677
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

34:10.279 --> 34:14.083
GET THE--LLOYD!

34:14.083 --> 34:16.085
WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL,
DR. SIMCOE?

34:16.085 --> 34:18.487
LLOYD!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

34:18.487 --> 34:20.759
DID YOUR FACILITY DETECT
ANYTHING SUPERLUMINAL?

34:20.759 --> 34:23.292
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH SIMON. WHY?

34:23.292 --> 34:25.394
WAS THERE ANY
CHERENKOV RADIATION?

34:28.837 --> 34:32.671
I... I CAN'T.

34:35.674 --> 34:38.447
LLOYD! TELL THEM WHAT THEY
WANT TO KNOW! LLOYD!

34:38.447 --> 34:44.313
VERY WELL THEN.
LET THE WILD RUMPUS BEGIN.

34:44.313 --> 34:46.415
(Simon grunts)

34:51.220 --> 34:54.323
(door opens)
HEY, KIDDO.

34:54.323 --> 34:57.696
GO BACK TO SLEEP, BABE.
I WAS JUST CHECKING IN ON YOU.

34:57.696 --> 35:00.229
I CAN'T.
WILL YOU SING SOME MORE?

35:00.229 --> 35:02.231
(chuckles)

35:02.231 --> 35:06.505
I THINK I EXHAUSTED MY
REPERTOIRE. I HAVE TO GO HOME.

35:06.505 --> 35:10.339
I SAVED YOU THIS
FROM MY DINNER.

35:10.339 --> 35:13.482
A COOKIE? YOU DID?

35:13.482 --> 35:16.185
(lightning crashes,
thunder rumbles)

35:18.417 --> 35:20.249
THANK YOU.

35:26.355 --> 35:30.399
HEY, AARON. IT'S MARK.
I THINK I COULD USE SOME HELP.

35:46.415 --> 35:48.317
(whoosh)

35:50.249 --> 35:55.254
â™ª WHEN YOU WISH
UPON A STAR â™ª

35:55.254 --> 35:59.288
â™ª MAKES NO DIFFERENCE â™ª

35:59.288 --> 36:02.291
â™ª WHO YOU ARE â™ª

36:02.291 --> 36:04.293
(mouths words)

36:04.293 --> 36:09.538
â™ª ANYTHING
YOUR HEART DESIRES â™ª

36:09.538 --> 36:14.243
â™ª WILL COME TO YOU â™ª

36:16.445 --> 36:19.177
(horn blares)

36:22.281 --> 36:25.414
TALK TO ME, MAN.

36:25.414 --> 36:27.416
WHAT'S HAPPENED, MARK?

36:27.416 --> 36:30.419
WHY ARE YOU SITTING HERE
IN YOUR CAR IN FRONT OF A BAR?

36:30.419 --> 36:32.791
IT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,
RIGHT?

36:32.791 --> 36:36.665
MY THERAPIST...

36:36.665 --> 36:39.298
GAVE ME THIS DRUG

36:39.298 --> 36:43.201
TO UNLOCK THE PARTS
OF MY FLASH-FORWARD

36:43.201 --> 36:45.274
I COULDN'T REMEMBER
BECAUSE I WAS DRINKING.

36:45.274 --> 36:47.306
(cell phone rings)
(exhales deeply)

36:47.306 --> 36:50.239
(beep)
(Lloyd) It's me.
I need to talk to you.

36:50.239 --> 36:52.711
EH, WELL,
THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

36:52.711 --> 36:56.345
I WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH LLOYD SIMCOE.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.989
Have you been drinking?
GO TO HELL, LLOYD.

37:00.989 --> 37:04.493
I TOLD HIM I-I DIDN'T
WANT TO TALK TO HIM.
Look, you have every right
to hate me, but--

37:04.493 --> 37:07.225
LISTEN, I DON'T HATE YOU.
I JUST WISH YOU WERE STANDING

37:07.225 --> 37:11.229
BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL
WHEN I CAME CRASHING THROUGH.
Fine, but we need to talk
about the Q.E.D.

37:11.229 --> 37:15.404
SOUNDED LIKE WE WERE
WORKING TOGETHER.
I'm not sure.
It's highly theoretical,

37:15.404 --> 37:16.835
but I'm--I'm close
to cracking it.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.237
LISTEN TO ME.
CLOSE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

37:19.237 --> 37:23.011
D. GIBBONS TOLD ME ABOUT--
The man you call
D. Gibbons lied to you.

37:23.011 --> 37:25.944
YOU NEED TO HURRY.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

37:25.944 --> 37:29.318
UNLESS WE CAN STOP THIS...
AND THEN I TOLD HIM...

37:32.651 --> 37:34.783
THERE'S GONNA BE
ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

37:47.936 --> 37:50.038
(Wedeck) ARE YOU SURE?

37:50.038 --> 37:52.701
I'M POSITIVE. THERE'S GONNA
BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

37:52.701 --> 37:54.973
IF SIMCOE SAW THE SAME THING
YOU DID,

37:54.973 --> 37:57.546
WHY'S HE BEEN SITTING ON THIS
INFORMATION THE WHOLE TIME?

37:57.546 --> 37:59.578
WHY HASN'T HE COME FORWARD?

37:59.578 --> 38:02.381
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S FIND HIM AND ASK HIM.

38:02.381 --> 38:05.854
LET ME BACK IN,
AND I CAN TRACK HIM.
LOOK, GO HOME.

38:05.854 --> 38:07.986
I'M DOING MY BEST
TO GET YOU REINSTATED.

38:07.986 --> 38:10.319
I PROMISE.
W-WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO TILL THEN?

38:10.319 --> 38:13.392
YOU SAID YOU SAW MORE CLUES
FROM YOUR VISION.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.293
WORK THEM...

38:15.293 --> 38:17.596
(lowers voice)
BUT BE QUIET ABOUT IT.
ALL RIGHT.

38:17.596 --> 38:21.029
THIS BUSINESS
ABOUT ANOTHER BLACKOUT...

38:21.029 --> 38:23.031
KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

38:23.031 --> 38:25.974
IF WE CAN'T TELL THE WORLD
WHEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

38:25.974 --> 38:28.407
THAT'S BEYOND IRRESPONSIBLE.

38:29.938 --> 38:32.541
THIS IS THE NUMBER FOR ONE
OF OUR MISSING E.M.T.s.

38:32.541 --> 38:35.313
WE'RE HOPING THE PHONE MIGHT
STILL BE IN THE AMBULANCE.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.687
CAN YOU TRACK IT FOR US?
YEAH. IF THE BATTERY'S STILL GOT
JUICE, I CAN CAPTURE THE SIGNAL

38:38.687 --> 38:41.620
AND TRIANGULATE ITS POSITION.
HOW CLOSE CAN YOU GET US?

38:41.620 --> 38:44.052
TO WITHIN 50 METERS
IF IT'S IN THE CITY.

38:44.052 --> 38:46.355
GREAT. LET'S DO IT.
(typing)

38:54.533 --> 38:57.966
SOMETIMES WE FEEL GOD'S HAND
ON THE BACK OF OUR NECK

38:57.966 --> 39:02.371
PUSHING US TOWARDS SOMETHING,
AND SOMETIMES

39:02.371 --> 39:04.573
WE FEEL TOTALLY ABANDONED.

39:04.573 --> 39:06.575
THAT'S NORMAL.

39:06.575 --> 39:09.077
BUT JUST BECAUSE
YOU DON'T FEEL SOMETHING

39:09.077 --> 39:11.450
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT THERE.

39:13.682 --> 39:16.655
HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE
HAVE GOTTEN SUNBURNED

39:16.655 --> 39:18.757
ON A CLOUDY DAY?

39:18.757 --> 39:23.392
YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
WORKING ON YOU, BUT IT WAS.

39:23.392 --> 39:25.594
GOD'S LOVE IS JUST LIKE THAT--

39:25.594 --> 39:33.472
WORKING FOR YOUR GOOD, WHETHER
YOU ARE AWARE OF IT OR NOT.

39:33.472 --> 39:36.805
HERE YOU GO. THANK YOU.

39:36.805 --> 39:40.148
SORRY.
I JUST HAD A QUESTION.
SURE.

39:40.148 --> 39:43.512
WHAT ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY
BEFORE GOD?

39:43.512 --> 39:46.515
DON'T WE OWE HIM SOMETHING?
LIKE WHAT?

39:46.515 --> 39:48.016
OBEDIENCE?

39:48.016 --> 39:51.790
I MEAN, WE NEED TO FOLLOW
THE RULES THAT HE SETS OUT.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.762
AND IF WE DON'T?

39:53.762 --> 39:56.525
WE GET PUNISHED.

39:56.525 --> 39:58.927
I-I JUST DON'T SEE
HOW YOU CAN SAY

39:58.927 --> 40:01.099
THAT THE BLACKOUT WAS GOOD.

40:01.099 --> 40:04.533
AND LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT DIED.

40:04.533 --> 40:07.476
LOOK AT ALL THE TROUBLE
IT'S CAUSING.
WOW. CLEARLY, I'VE UPSET YOU.

40:07.476 --> 40:09.638
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK--
IN THE VERY LEAST,

40:09.638 --> 40:11.640
THE FLASH-FORWARDS
WERE A WAKE-UP CALL

40:11.640 --> 40:16.144
FOR US TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE?
I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME.

40:16.144 --> 40:17.716
NICOLE.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.448
MY NAME IS TIMOTHY.

40:19.448 --> 40:21.450
I'D REALLY LIKE
TO KEEP TALKING WITH YOU,

40:21.450 --> 40:24.493
BUT IF I DON'T GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE MY HOUR'S UP,

40:24.493 --> 40:25.854
I GET CHARGED.
WELL, THANKS.

40:25.854 --> 40:28.096
THERE'S A COFFEE SHOP
I LIKE NEARBY.

40:28.096 --> 40:31.560
IF YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT AGAIN LATER...

40:36.164 --> 40:38.136
(tires screech, gears shift)

40:38.136 --> 40:41.470
(car door opens)

40:43.712 --> 40:45.443
(elevator bell dings)

40:45.443 --> 40:48.446
RED PANDA PROVIDES HUMANITARIAN
AID ALL AROUND THE WORLD--

40:48.446 --> 40:51.449
EVERYTHING FROM
MICRO-INVESTMENTS TO EDUCATION.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.552
WE'VE BEEN EXTREMELY BUSY
SINCE THE BLACKOUT,

40:53.552 --> 40:55.554
AS I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.786
YOU SAID YOU DO WORK
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

40:57.786 --> 41:00.589
YES. WE GREW OUT OF D.H.S.
IN THE '90s--

41:00.589 --> 41:02.731
YOU KNOW, DEMOGRAPHIC
AND HEALTH SERVICES.

41:02.731 --> 41:05.163
WE'RE IN SOUTH AMERICA,
THE MIDDLE EAST,

41:05.163 --> 41:07.165
THE AFRICAN SUBCONTINENT--

41:07.165 --> 41:08.697
SOMALIA?

41:08.697 --> 41:11.600
WAS RED PANDA THERE IN '91?

41:11.600 --> 41:13.702
THERE WAS NO RED PANDA
IN 1991.

41:13.702 --> 41:16.204
WE WEREN'T CHARTERED
UNTIL '98.

41:16.204 --> 41:20.749
AND YOU SEND IN,
WHAT, TEAMS OF PEOPLE?
WITH CLEAN WATER SUPPLIES,
MOSTLY.

41:20.749 --> 41:22.751
THE WARLORDS
KEEP MOST EVERYONE OUT,

41:22.751 --> 41:25.213
BUT, YOU KNOW, HUMANITARIAN
GROUPS LIKE US CAN GET IN.

41:25.213 --> 41:29.217
IS THERE ANYONE
I COULD TALK TO ABOUT MAYBE...

41:29.217 --> 41:32.220
PIGGYBACKING ON
ONE OF RED PANDA'S TRIPS?

41:32.220 --> 41:35.493
UM... DOUBT IT.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.966
NOT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL,
BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE

41:37.966 --> 41:40.228
WORKING HERE PROBABLY
HAVE POLICE RECORDS...

41:40.228 --> 41:42.200
(whispers)
AS THICK AS THE BIBLE.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.533
WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT
ANYMORE.
(normal voice) UH-HUH.

41:44.533 --> 41:48.577
HAVE A NICE DAY,
AGENT BENFORD.

41:48.577 --> 41:51.239
(clicks)

41:51.239 --> 41:55.113
DR. SIMCOE, HOW MANY
ELECTRON VOLTS WERE GENERATED?

41:55.113 --> 41:58.216
IT'S A NUMBER, DR. SIMCOE--

41:58.216 --> 42:00.689
AN ABSTRACT OBJECT.

42:00.689 --> 42:03.722
I CAN'T SACRIFICE
ANY MORE LIVES.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.724
"SACRIFICE"
IS AN INTERESTING WORD.

42:05.724 --> 42:07.996
I APPRECIATE ITS DUALITY.

42:07.996 --> 42:11.860
IT CAN BE USED AS
BOTH NOUN OR A VERB.
(grunting)

42:11.860 --> 42:14.833
ONE CAN TAKE ACTION, SURRENDER,
OR GIVE SOMETHING UP

42:14.833 --> 42:17.305
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

42:17.305 --> 42:19.738
I, HOWEVER, PREFER
THE GREEK NOUN FORM THUSIA,

42:19.738 --> 42:23.011
TO INDICATE THE OBJECT ITSELF
THAT IS SACRIFICED...

42:23.011 --> 42:24.573
(coughs)
MEANING ONE'S FAMILY...

42:24.573 --> 42:26.945
(Simon) LLOYD?
OR THE PROVERBIAL POUND
OF FLESH.

42:30.218 --> 42:32.150
(grunts)

42:32.150 --> 42:34.322
(Simon) NO. NO! NO! NO!
NO!

42:34.322 --> 42:36.885
AAH! LLOYD!

42:36.885 --> 42:39.187
TELL THEM WHAT THEY WANT,
LLOYD!

42:39.187 --> 42:41.790
AAH! AAH! JUST TELL--

42:41.790 --> 42:44.562
(screams)
