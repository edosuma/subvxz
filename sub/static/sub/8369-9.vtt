-Lucifer.

How'd you know
about this place, anyway?

00:21.722 --> 00:22.721
Her grandfather
took her here.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.390
If I catch you
hanging around gracie again,

00:24.392 --> 00:26.458
I'm gonna snap your fingers off,
drummer boy.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.060
I know you don't like
helping pritchard,

00:28.062 --> 00:28.994
But I do.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.396
It makes me happy.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.731
If we go in two directions,
we will pull apart.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.066
What's wrong?
What happened?

00:34.068 --> 00:35.401
Your blood...

00:35.403 --> 00:36.668
It worked.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.670
Arthur:
Her system is clear of cancer.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.073
May I ask what we will do
with mr. Pritchard?

00:41.075 --> 00:41.607
He'll be leaving.

00:45.578 --> 00:49.581
This is weird, not having
to do this anymore --

00:49.583 --> 00:50.682
Get hooked up.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.551
Just kind of
half getting used to it.

00:54.587 --> 00:57.156
I know you didn't ask
for any of this, but thank you.

00:58.525 --> 01:00.659
For saving my life.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.262
Hey, it wasn't all bad.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.732
Got to live here
and drive that car.

01:08.701 --> 01:11.770
I should thank you for
bringing me back from the dead.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.006
Nobody's ever done that
for me before.

01:15.775 --> 01:19.011
You know, that day
that you brought me back,

01:19.013 --> 01:21.447
You said that otto
couldn't be without you.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.950
I guess now you can go back
to taking care of him.

01:24.952 --> 01:28.687
I guess I'll find
my own place to live.

01:28.689 --> 01:29.788
Now that you're cured,

01:29.790 --> 01:32.691
There's not really much point
in me being here.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.695
No.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.698
Now that I'm cured,
there's not.

01:41.901 --> 01:44.703
Otto says he can move
the tank wherever I go.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.639
It's automated.
Sends you updates or something.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.242
I can have alexa line up
some places for you to see.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.211
No,
I can take care of it.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.079
Of course you can.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.380
Sorry.

01:56.649 --> 01:59.718
You know, I never thought
it would work...

02:01.488 --> 02:03.388
...This cure.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.658
Never thought
I'd have to figure out

02:06.660 --> 02:07.960
What to do
with the rest of my life.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.164
I know what you mean.

02:16.603 --> 02:19.004
Connor: Cured.
Not remission, but cured?

02:19.006 --> 02:21.573
Yes. No need
for further treatments.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.576
Now I'll never get
lookinglass or otto,

02:24.578 --> 02:26.578
And without otto,
you can't have george.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.580
You don't need otto.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.782
I snuck into the lab.
I-I sent you the data.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.284
It wasn't enough.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.087
The information
wasn't enough for my scientist

02:35.089 --> 02:37.422
To reverse-engineer
how he brought pritchard back.

[ sighs ]

02:45.698 --> 02:47.933

02:47.935 --> 02:50.769
You mention here
that mary and pritchard

02:50.771 --> 02:52.371
Have grown close, right?

02:52.373 --> 02:53.705
Oh, they would never
admit it,

02:53.707 --> 02:55.607
But I can see it
when they're together.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.709
All right.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.545
Oh.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.281
You're gonna use pritchard
to take otto away from mary?

03:02.283 --> 03:04.383
No, we're -- we're
just going to show otto

03:04.385 --> 03:06.318
That the man he brought back
to save his sister

03:06.320 --> 03:07.386
Is taking her away from him.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.487
That's --
mr. Graff...

03:08.489 --> 03:10.055
Sneaking into a lab
is one thing,

03:10.057 --> 03:13.058
But if mary were to find out
that we turned otto against her,

03:13.060 --> 03:15.060
Her -- her heart
would break.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.728
There's got to be
another way.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.163
Alexa.

03:18.165 --> 03:23.402
Alexa, I realize you've
grown very fond of mary,

03:23.404 --> 03:26.238
But you have to remember
what your purpose was.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.476
Otto brought you back
to save her.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.679
When he saw that you couldn't,
that you were twisted,

03:33.681 --> 03:36.582
That your blood wasn't right
for her, he just threw you away.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.819
You were unformed
when I found you...

03:40.821 --> 03:45.157
Where otto left you there
to die,

03:45.159 --> 03:48.994
But as soon as you could speak,
you said one word.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.662
You remember?

03:53.032 --> 03:55.534
I said...

03:55.536 --> 03:57.069
"george."

03:58.771 --> 04:00.205
George.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.441
George is your purpose now.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.210
He's old.

04:05.212 --> 04:08.013
And he's near the end.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.348
But he doesn't have to be.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.784
If you want george
here with you,

04:12.786 --> 04:15.053
You're gonna have to break
otto away from mary.

04:15.055 --> 04:18.624
Okay?

04:21.561 --> 04:24.129
Alexa, where are we
with the attendees

04:24.131 --> 04:25.631
For the cancer cure meeting?

04:25.633 --> 04:27.566
All lookinglass department heads
will be here in the office.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.067

stanford, harvard, and m.I.T.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.638
Will be on the poly-com,

04:32.640 --> 04:34.706
And reps from the f.D.A.
Will be on speaker phone.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.741
Good.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.142
James won't be living
with us anymore,

04:37.144 --> 04:38.644
But his blood
is the basis for the cure,

04:38.646 --> 04:40.545
So how often will he need
to be at the lab?

04:40.547 --> 04:42.814
We don't need him
at the lab.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.082
What do you mean?

04:44.084 --> 04:46.218
Once I stockpile
enough of his blood samples

04:46.220 --> 04:47.653
As the basis
for the research,

04:47.655 --> 04:49.554
We'll never
have to see him again.

05:05.271 --> 05:06.605

05:06.607 --> 05:08.674
It's really too bad.

Oh, that mr. Pritchard
won't be here with us anymore.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.246
Why is that?

05:14.248 --> 05:15.414
Well, it's silly.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.683
I just...
A little part of me thought

05:17.685 --> 05:21.019
It wasn't just his blood
that was saving your sister.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.521
Of course
it was just his blood.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.689
What else
could it have been?

05:23.691 --> 05:25.857
Oh, I'm not a scientist.

05:25.859 --> 05:30.529
I just thought, when
they're together, mary seemed...

05:30.531 --> 05:32.931
I don't know,
more alive.

You're not a scientist.
