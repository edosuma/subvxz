01:56.999 --> 02:02.098
<i>In October, my brother and I left Ohio.
We were driving to California.</i>

02:02.638 --> 02:05.238
<i>We got into Dallas on a Thursday night.</i>

02:05.508 --> 02:10.241
Friday morning, while I'm eating eggs
and drinking coffee, I get a good job.

02:10.342 --> 02:14.142
I mean, it's, you know... all these people
are supposedly out of work.

02:15.284 --> 02:18.248
I'm not in town a half a day,
and I've got a job.

02:18.588 --> 02:22.246
Everything clicked.
It's as if I was meant to be here.

02:28.364 --> 02:32.330
I'd run away from home a couple
of times. Once or twice. I don't know.

02:34.070 --> 02:37.974
And this all started,
David is running away from home.

02:38.074 --> 02:42.074
<i>And he takes... I took
a pistol of my dad's and a shotgun.</i>

02:42.945 --> 02:44.737
Took a neighbor's car.

02:44.881 --> 02:47.750
I had broken into their house
and got the keys to it.

02:47.850 --> 02:50.780
I forget exactly what it was.

02:56.292 --> 02:58.221
Ended up coming to Dallas.

03:06.402 --> 03:08.797
<i>I went to work and no one showed up.</i>

03:09.138 --> 03:12.671
<i>Being a weekend, sometimes
they worked, sometimes they didn't.</i>

03:13.276 --> 03:16.179
On the way home, I ran out of gas.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.380
And as I was walking down the street
with the gas can...

03:21.017 --> 03:23.845
a person, at that time, pulled over.

03:24.854 --> 03:26.656
I guess since I had the gas can...

03:26.756 --> 03:31.154
he figured I was out of gas.
I wasn't 100 yards from the car.

03:31.494 --> 03:34.497
And being Thanksgiving weekend,
there was no gas stations open.

03:34.597 --> 03:36.992
He stopped and asked me
if I needed any help.

03:40.069 --> 03:43.136
<i>I'm driving down some street
somewhere in Dallas.</i>

03:44.040 --> 03:45.764
<i>I had just turned 16.</i>

03:47.810 --> 03:50.913
<i>And there was a guy over there,
I think he'd run out of gas...</i>

03:51.013 --> 03:55.081
<i>I took him to get some gas.
This was Randall Adams.</i>

03:59.755 --> 04:03.948
<i>Ended up following him where
him and his brother were staying.</i>

04:04.393 --> 04:06.424
Eventually, that evening...

04:08.030 --> 04:10.833
we went out and got some beer.

04:10.933 --> 04:13.803
We smoked a little marijuana
and what have you.

04:13.903 --> 04:15.798
Went to a movie that night.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.411
I get up, I go to work on Saturday.

04:22.511 --> 04:25.214
Why did I meet this kid? I don't know.

04:25.314 --> 04:29.450
Why did I run out of gas at that time?
I don't know. But it happened.

06:15.725 --> 06:19.088
<i>The day they picked me up, December 21.</i>

06:20.663 --> 06:23.933
They took me upstairs.
What floor, I don't know.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.825
But they put me in a little room.

06:28.838 --> 06:30.528
<i>Gus Rose walked in.</i>

06:34.043 --> 06:36.973
<i>He had a confession there
he wanted me to sign.</i>

06:41.550 --> 06:43.052
<i>He said that I would sign.</i>

06:43.152 --> 06:47.516
<i>He didn't give a damn what I said.
I would sign this piece of paper.</i>

06:48.257 --> 06:50.049
<i>I told him I couldn't.</i>

06:53.696 --> 06:57.667
"I don't know what the hell
you people expect of me.

06:57.767 --> 07:00.231
"But there's no way I can sign that."

07:00.569 --> 07:04.068
He left. He came back in 10 minutes.

07:04.607 --> 07:06.832
<i>And threw a pistol on the table.</i>

07:08.043 --> 07:12.407
Asked me to look at it.
Which I did. I looked.

07:13.249 --> 07:16.509
<i>He asked me to pick it up.</i>

07:17.253 --> 07:19.978
<i>I told him no, I wouldn't do that.</i>

07:20.890 --> 07:22.421
<i>He threatened me.</i>

07:23.058 --> 07:25.158
<i>Again, I told him no.</i>

07:26.195 --> 07:28.625
<i>He pulled his service revolver on me.</i>

07:31.000 --> 07:35.933
<i>We looked at each other for...
To me, it seemed hours.</i>

07:36.972 --> 07:40.005
I do not like looking down
the barrel of a pistol.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.400
I do not like being threatened.

07:43.712 --> 07:47.211
When he finally saw
that he would either have to kill me...

07:47.950 --> 07:49.352
or forget the signature...

07:49.452 --> 07:53.088
I guess he forgot the signature,
because he put his pistol up.

07:53.622 --> 07:58.521
He took the pistol on the table,
put it up and stormed out.

07:59.595 --> 08:03.065
I had a casual, friendly conversation
with him to start with...

08:03.165 --> 08:05.735
to try to size him up...

08:05.835 --> 08:09.027
to see what he liked
and what he didn't like.

08:10.773 --> 08:14.377
I found almost immediately
that he didn't have much conscience.

08:14.477 --> 08:18.773
Anything he had done,
it never really bothered him.

08:19.381 --> 08:21.817
He had done other things
that he told me about...

08:21.917 --> 08:24.453
that didn't seem
to bother him in the least.

08:24.553 --> 08:27.244
He showed no expression whatsoever.

08:28.691 --> 08:33.294
It's just like he's sitting here
talking about the color of this wall...

08:34.730 --> 08:36.760
or the shooting of the police officer.

08:39.501 --> 08:42.169
He showed no reaction
to any of the questions.

08:46.542 --> 08:49.044
He almost overacted his innocence.

08:49.144 --> 08:51.680
He protested he hadn't done anything.

08:51.780 --> 08:55.711
Couldn't imagine
why we were bringing him in.

08:56.585 --> 08:59.522
He didn't fight or he didn't resist.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.847
He just protested his innocence.

09:02.324 --> 09:07.018
I told them what happened that
Saturday, that I had met this kid.

09:07.563 --> 09:09.924
<i>I kept telling them the same thing.</i>

09:11.200 --> 09:13.391
<i>They didn't want to believe me.</i>

09:14.169 --> 09:16.997
<i>Never once was I allowed a phone call.</i>

09:17.306 --> 09:19.906
<i>Never once was an attorney there.</i>

09:20.376 --> 09:23.101
<i>I don't know how long this had been.</i>

09:23.212 --> 09:27.576
<i>I had smoked two packs of cigarettes
and had been out for a long time.</i>

09:43.732 --> 09:47.136
Wood didn't take his ticket book
out of the car.

09:47.236 --> 09:49.572
He left it in the car
on the front seat...

09:49.672 --> 09:52.541
which indicates
that he was not going to write a ticket.

09:52.641 --> 09:56.278
What he was probably going to do
was have them turn on the headlights.

09:56.378 --> 10:00.241
He didn't know that the car was stolen.

10:00.516 --> 10:03.886
I think that there's
a very good chance...

10:03.986 --> 10:06.522
that he was going
to check the driver's license...

10:06.622 --> 10:10.226
and tell him to turn on his headlights,
and let the guy be on his way.

10:10.326 --> 10:13.051
Officer Wood's wife had purchased him...

10:13.929 --> 10:16.966
a bulletproof vest
and had it under the Christmas tree.

10:17.066 --> 10:21.168
<i>Or had it stored away,
to give to him at Christmastime.</i>

10:22.771 --> 10:27.176
His partner was one of the first
female police officers...

10:27.276 --> 10:28.377
that was assigned to patrol.

10:28.477 --> 10:32.481
They were from the Northwest Station.
Just patrol officers following the clock.

10:32.581 --> 10:35.306
<i>Working the graveyard shift
and everything.</i>

10:35.451 --> 10:39.553
<i>They had been into a fast-food
restaurant. And she had a malt.</i>

10:40.422 --> 10:44.524
<i>This car came by, these
two dudes in it, with no lights on.</i>

10:55.070 --> 10:56.438
<i>It wasn't a serious problem...</i>

10:56.538 --> 10:59.241
<i>but he just pulled up,
turned his lights on to stop him.</i>

10:59.341 --> 11:02.237
<i>Just to warn the man
that his lights were off.</i>

11:14.456 --> 11:16.258
<i>Got out of the car and walked up.</i>

11:16.358 --> 11:19.395
<i>Before he got to the window,
where the driver was...</i>

11:19.495 --> 11:20.863
he was in the right position.

11:20.963 --> 11:23.299
This man just turned around and just...

11:23.399 --> 11:26.090
with a little small-caliber pistol.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.535
The first shot hit him in the arm.

11:35.711 --> 11:40.015
He had his flashlight. It hit
the flashlight and went into his arm.

11:40.115 --> 11:42.078
The next one hit him right in the chest.

11:50.159 --> 11:53.562
<i>The officer falls in the street
and he was in the first traffic lane.</i>

11:53.662 --> 11:55.853
<i>He lay there and bled to death.</i>

11:57.132 --> 11:58.601
<i>So she's out of the car.</i>

11:58.701 --> 12:01.236
<i>She empties her pistol
at the fleeing suspect...</i>

12:01.336 --> 12:03.231
<i>and she runs to his aid.</i>

12:06.742 --> 12:09.845
Procedure says you grab the radio
and call for an ambulance.

12:09.945 --> 12:13.114
Common sense would tell you that.
But what do you do?

12:13.716 --> 12:17.181
<i>And that time,
she's so... just tore down.</i>

12:18.220 --> 12:20.911
<i>And the blood.
An enormous amount of blood.</i>

12:27.162 --> 12:31.799
How do we hold her responsible
for not following procedure?

12:33.936 --> 12:37.401
But the main thing was, she
couldn't remember the license number.

12:53.122 --> 12:57.884
When we started putting facts together
on how much information we had...

12:58.560 --> 13:03.163
from the leads we had,
we found out we didn't have anything.

13:03.565 --> 13:08.464
The only thing that we knew
we were looking for was a blue Vega.

13:09.338 --> 13:13.542
<i>Probably every Vega that was
registered in the state of Texas...</i>

13:13.642 --> 13:15.639
<i>was stopped and checked.</i>

13:16.345 --> 13:19.348
We had people calling the office...

13:19.448 --> 13:22.484
saying, "I've got a Vega
and it's not blue.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.820
"But would you come out
and be sure to check it.

13:24.920 --> 13:28.724
"Be sure it's not mine, because
I don't want to get stopped anymore.

13:28.824 --> 13:30.286
"I'm afraid."

13:35.631 --> 13:38.133
If you're the investigator
assigned to the murder...

13:38.233 --> 13:40.536
you get frustrated with other witnesses.

13:40.636 --> 13:43.872
But when you got a police officer
that witnessed it...

13:43.972 --> 13:47.903
you expect that they would know
a little more than she knew.

13:48.944 --> 13:49.912
<i>Procedure.</i>

13:50.012 --> 13:53.315
<i>When there's a two-person unit,
when either one approaches the car...</i>

13:53.415 --> 13:56.085
<i>the other positions himself
to the right rear...</i>

13:56.185 --> 13:59.521
<i>where they can watch
all the activity in the car.</i>

13:59.621 --> 14:03.258
<i>And if the man on the left of the driver
gets in trouble...</i>

14:03.358 --> 14:06.254
<i>their partner is in a position to help.</i>

14:07.596 --> 14:10.232
Speculation was, at the time...

14:10.332 --> 14:13.296
that his partner was sitting in the car.

14:35.057 --> 14:37.452
<i>That's where the discrepancies were.</i>

14:37.693 --> 14:41.663
<i>Just a matter of time, and whether
or not she was out of the car...</i>

14:41.763 --> 14:44.466
<i>completely out of the car,
or partially in the car...</i>

14:44.566 --> 14:47.326
<i>or just sitting in there
with the door closed.</i>

14:49.171 --> 14:52.534
<i>And the thing I think we did then
that really helped...</i>

14:54.009 --> 14:57.212
It didn't really help anything at all.
Let me back up.

14:57.312 --> 14:59.882
But it was interesting,
and it cost a lot of money...

14:59.982 --> 15:03.413
but it was worthwhile.
You got to cover every trail.

15:21.803 --> 15:24.540
<i>A guy out of California...</i>

15:24.640 --> 15:27.709
<i>I don't recall his name,
he was an expert in hypnosis.</i>

15:27.809 --> 15:29.945
<i>He came down,
hypnotized her and questioned her.</i>

15:30.045 --> 15:31.346
What was interesting was...

15:31.446 --> 15:34.183
she couldn't remember anything
particularly about the car.

15:34.283 --> 15:35.818
She remembered getting a malt.

15:35.918 --> 15:38.353
They'd stopped in the fast-food.
It was a Whataburger.

15:38.453 --> 15:40.622
They remembered all that,
and stopping the car.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.025
Got back on the road.
She didn't remember anything.

15:43.125 --> 15:46.962
But she remembered a license number
off a hit-and-run vehicle...

15:47.062 --> 15:49.594
that they had worked
earlier in the night.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.926
<i>It was getting awfully close
to Christmas.</i>

16:18.026 --> 16:21.797
We'd never gone that long in Dallas
without clearing a murder of an officer.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.000
We'd had several killed,
but we'd cleared them pretty quick.

16:25.100 --> 16:28.403
And this case had gone a month,
or nearly a month...

16:28.503 --> 16:30.305
and we still hadn't cleared it.

16:30.405 --> 16:34.564
We finally got the break that cleared it.
It came out of Vidor, Texas.

16:38.981 --> 16:42.751
Mr. Calvin Cunningham, who lives
in Vidor, had his home broken into...

16:42.851 --> 16:47.078
and his little Mercury Comet stolen.

16:47.356 --> 16:50.081
<i>We felt as though
David had committed that crime.</i>

16:50.559 --> 16:54.661
<i>For several days, though,
he was missing. We couldn't find him.</i>

16:55.263 --> 16:58.934
It was one afternoon, one of our
officers spotted Cunningham's car...

16:59.034 --> 17:01.236
on North Main Street, here in Vidor.

17:01.336 --> 17:04.630
David abandoned the vehicle
and ran on foot.

17:07.376 --> 17:10.311
We started getting
little bits of information, though...

17:10.412 --> 17:15.049
that David had been involved in a
shooting in Dallas of a police officer.

17:15.349 --> 17:18.678
<i>We would always get
third-hand rumor, fourth-hand rumor.</i>

17:19.253 --> 17:24.289
So we went back to a few of his other
comrades in crime, we could call them.

17:24.393 --> 17:27.628
They said,
"We thought he was just bragging.

17:27.729 --> 17:30.065
"We didn't really take him seriously."

17:30.165 --> 17:33.035
Sitting down, watching the
evening news, well, the night news.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.462
My father was asleep on the couch.

17:35.570 --> 17:39.069
Heard somebody knocking at the door.
It was David Harris.

17:39.741 --> 17:41.143
I let him in. He came in.

17:41.243 --> 17:43.679
He was standing there beside my chair...

17:43.779 --> 17:48.382
and a news broadcast advertised
about a police officer shot in Dallas.

17:49.384 --> 17:51.920
Right then and there he starts
swearing up and down.

17:52.020 --> 17:55.557
He says, "I swear to God,
I shot that fucking pig."

17:55.657 --> 17:57.559
He says, "I'm the one that killed him."

17:57.659 --> 18:00.429
Somewhere around Dallas,
they got pulled over.

18:00.529 --> 18:04.032
I think he said because
they were checking out a stolen car.

18:04.132 --> 18:08.003
He said that the cop
had pulled him over...

18:08.103 --> 18:09.905
and walked up to the window.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.374
When the cop came,
he rolled down the window...

18:12.474 --> 18:14.843
and just pulled the gun up and shot him.

18:14.943 --> 18:16.445
He swore up and down.

18:16.545 --> 18:19.881
He made a big scene about it.
Jumped up and down...

18:19.981 --> 18:21.917
trying to get anybody and everybody...

18:22.017 --> 18:25.243
to listen to him.
"Yeah, I shot that son of a gun."

18:25.353 --> 18:28.317
And everybody said,
"Sure you did, David. Sure."

18:28.590 --> 18:31.190
"I swear to God I killed that cop."

18:31.660 --> 18:36.092
I asked him if he'd been to Dallas.
He denied having been to Dallas.

18:36.498 --> 18:38.900
I asked him if he'd been involved
in any shooting...

18:39.000 --> 18:43.193
or knew anything about a shooting,
and he denied that to the end.

18:43.371 --> 18:47.209
Which is fairly consistent with David.
Even if he had some involvement...

18:47.309 --> 18:50.979
his first way that he always treats you,
he would deny.

18:51.079 --> 18:53.949
Then, if he felt as though
you really knew he had done it...

18:54.049 --> 18:56.114
then he would be truthful with you.

18:56.418 --> 18:59.109
He give me a pistol,
a .22 caliber pistol.

18:59.554 --> 19:03.690
He showed it to me. He says,
"That's the one I shot him with."

19:04.459 --> 19:06.490
He gave me the pistol.

19:08.196 --> 19:09.898
I didn't really consider it that much.

19:09.998 --> 19:13.429
I don't guess I really realized
he did shoot the cop.

19:14.002 --> 19:16.671
He led me to a swampy area...

19:16.771 --> 19:19.608
several hundred yards
behind his residence in Rose City.

19:19.708 --> 19:22.244
<i>There was a sock under water.
He said, "There it is."</i>

19:22.344 --> 19:25.240
<i>And he had sprayed
this sock with boot oil.</i>

19:26.348 --> 19:28.116
When we retrieved the gun...

19:28.216 --> 19:31.653
I said, "I better do something with it.
It's going to rust up."

19:31.753 --> 19:36.191
Even the time that I saw the gun
at the trial in Dallas...

19:36.291 --> 19:39.194
it looked just as good
as when I'd taken it out of the swamp.

19:39.294 --> 19:43.362
So he had taken pretty good care of it,
even though he did put it under water.

19:47.002 --> 19:49.237
He got to thinking...

19:49.337 --> 19:52.836
"I didn't do that
and I've been saying that I did...

19:53.008 --> 19:56.711
"and I'm in over my head now,
I better tell them what happened.

19:56.811 --> 20:00.649
"Because they are going to send me
to the penitentiary for life...

20:00.749 --> 20:03.285
"if I don't tell them
what really happened."

20:03.385 --> 20:06.721
So he said,
"I am just bragging about this.

20:06.821 --> 20:10.752
"I didn't do it, but I was there,
and I know who did do it."

20:11.159 --> 20:14.157
And, of course, he came clean then.

20:15.597 --> 20:17.992
<i>He tried to hide no facts.</i>

20:18.567 --> 20:21.031
<i>He just seemed like a friendly kid.</i>

20:22.504 --> 20:27.334
I may have talked to him
15 or 20 minutes on a friendly basis...

20:30.178 --> 20:32.107
just to keep him friendly.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.242
We didn't want to make him mad.

20:41.256 --> 20:44.092
But we didn't want him to tell us
something that he thought.

20:44.192 --> 20:46.656
We wanted him to tell us what we knew.

20:46.995 --> 20:50.358
It wasn't very long until I realized
that what he knew...

20:51.166 --> 20:54.769
was the facts of the case,
and it matched with what we knew.

20:54.869 --> 20:56.696
And it had to be right.

20:57.439 --> 20:59.539
<i>The story that I told was...</i>

21:00.242 --> 21:04.469
It was like 12:00 something.
So it was the next day...

21:05.947 --> 21:08.911
early in the morning. We were stopped.

21:11.886 --> 21:15.146
When we were stopped,
the officer came up to the car...

21:15.390 --> 21:19.526
and asked to see the driver's license,
and he just started shooting.

21:24.232 --> 21:29.096
I don't know why, but it's always
seemed like time just stopped.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.035
It didn't seem like any time passed.

21:35.510 --> 21:38.713
It just seemed like it was, boom!

21:38.813 --> 21:42.278
Time stopped or something.
I don't know what it is.

21:47.122 --> 21:48.721
It's like a flash.

21:51.192 --> 21:53.121
<i>We went back to his room.</i>

21:53.628 --> 21:57.999
He was supposed to ask his brother
if I could stay there that night.

21:58.099 --> 22:01.496
But he said
that his brother don't like to do that.

22:02.537 --> 22:06.173
Anyhow, he went in
and never came back out. So I left.

22:09.611 --> 22:12.006
Ended up pulling into a parking lot.

22:13.448 --> 22:15.717
I slept there I think, for a while.

22:15.817 --> 22:18.787
Then, finally, the next morning,
early or something...

22:18.887 --> 22:21.783
I found my way to Freeway 45.

22:22.457 --> 22:24.022
And went back home.

22:30.432 --> 22:34.302
After riding around with him,
I come to find out he's got an arsenal.

22:34.402 --> 22:38.834
He's got pistols. He's got rifles.

22:39.341 --> 22:43.144
He's got this pistol.
He's waving it around. He's doing this.

22:43.244 --> 22:47.505
I told him, "Hey, why don't you put
those in the trunk of the car?"

22:49.150 --> 22:51.019
<i>We stopped at a restaurant...</i>

22:51.119 --> 22:53.955
and ordered
and ate sandwiches in the car.

22:54.055 --> 22:55.813
I bought a six-pack of beer.

22:57.525 --> 22:59.661
<i>He pulled this pistol back out.</i>

22:59.761 --> 23:02.521
And I ask him why he got the pistol out.

23:02.664 --> 23:06.067
And he kind of laughed...

23:06.167 --> 23:09.894
rolled the window down,
and fired the pistol outside the car.

23:11.873 --> 23:14.598
And I asked him to please put it up.

23:16.544 --> 23:20.715
And I think he handed me the pistol,
and I put it under the driver's seat.

23:20.815 --> 23:24.542
<i>He wanted to go to the movies,
so we went to the movies.</i>

23:25.720 --> 23:28.286
<i>We got there probably at about 7:00.</i>

23:36.431 --> 23:39.301
<i>He was the one
that had picked the movie out.</i>

23:39.401 --> 23:42.337
<i>I call them drive-in movies,
beer-drinking movies.</i>

23:42.437 --> 23:45.307
<i>$0.50, put them together
and make a bunch of money...</i>

23:45.407 --> 23:48.343
<i>with a bunch of people
getting drunk at the drive-in.</i>

23:48.443 --> 23:51.746
<i>- Are you going to concede?
- Please, sit down...</i>

23:51.846 --> 23:53.775
<i>What is this, Mr. Brooks?</i>

23:53.982 --> 23:56.751
<i>- Anybody can see it's an ashtray.
- Wrong!</i>

23:56.851 --> 23:59.921
<i>Anybody can plainly see
it's a wall-breaker!</i>

24:00.021 --> 24:02.057
<i>I'm trying to speak for you!</i>

24:02.157 --> 24:06.760
<i>I'm trying to speak for all of you!
I am the student body!</i>

24:09.164 --> 24:13.494
<i>The show that was on was half over.
We watched half of the one show...</i>

24:14.269 --> 24:17.905
<i>we started watching
the first part of the second show.</i>

24:19.140 --> 24:23.071
<i>We want a victory,
and we're gonna get it.</i>

24:34.489 --> 24:36.925
<i>I didn't really care
for the second feature...</i>

24:37.025 --> 24:40.862
<i>which is an R-rated,
cheerleader-type thing.</i>

24:40.962 --> 24:42.891
<i>I don't know what it was.</i>

24:43.631 --> 24:45.355
<i>May I have some wine?</i>

25:02.050 --> 25:04.352
<i>It's good, Ross.
I didn't know you could cook.</i>

25:04.452 --> 25:06.176
<i>It is good, isn't it?</i>

25:06.988 --> 25:09.952
<i>You got to try my celery rémoulade.</i>

25:22.103 --> 25:24.271
<i>No.</i>

25:30.778 --> 25:32.714
<i>I told him I wanted to leave.</i>

25:32.814 --> 25:37.041
"I don't really care
to sit here and watch this. Let's go."

25:40.355 --> 25:44.992
He's acting strange, he wanted
to watch the end. Anyway, we left.

25:45.360 --> 25:49.121
<i>We drove back towards Dallas
and we drove to the motel.</i>

25:51.132 --> 25:54.536
<i>There's a little store.
I bought a pack of cigarettes...</i>

25:54.636 --> 25:56.204
<i>and a newspaper.</i>

25:56.304 --> 25:59.337
And when I left,
this kid was still sitting there.

26:00.475 --> 26:03.812
I leaned against the car and we
talked to him for a few minutes...

26:03.912 --> 26:07.916
and I told him
that since he was looking for a job...

26:08.016 --> 26:09.918
and there hadn't been anybody at work...

26:10.018 --> 26:12.720
that if he wanted to stop back
Monday morning...

26:12.820 --> 26:15.657
that sure, he could ride out
and follow me to work...

26:15.757 --> 26:19.324
and he could talk to the boss.
And he would probably get a job.

26:19.894 --> 26:23.932
I told him that I would catch him
Monday morning if he showed up.

26:24.032 --> 26:26.367
I told him what time I went to work.
Why, I left.

26:26.467 --> 26:29.397
I walked around the store
and went to the house.

26:29.571 --> 26:34.140
When I walked in, the television was
on and my brother was sleeping.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.442
He had been home this whole time
that I had been gone.

26:37.845 --> 26:39.876
<i>So I made me a sandwich...</i>

26:40.448 --> 26:43.640
<i>and sat there and watched the end of
The Carol Burnett Show.</i>

26:46.654 --> 26:51.553
<i>When it went off, the news came on
and I watched 15 minutes of it.</i>

26:52.894 --> 26:55.824
And that was it.
I turned the TV off and went to sleep.

27:10.445 --> 27:13.915
<i>Finally, they bring in a stenographer.</i>

27:14.015 --> 27:17.013
<i>She sits down and I run the story.</i>

27:17.385 --> 27:20.321
<i>I tell them what happened this Saturday.</i>

27:20.421 --> 27:22.919
<i>She leaves. She types.</i>

27:49.784 --> 27:52.654
<i>She comes back
in about 25 to 30 minutes...</i>

27:52.754 --> 27:55.548
<i>with a copy of this statement.</i>

27:56.691 --> 27:58.381
<i>I read through it...</i>

27:59.394 --> 28:03.121
<i>and when it was basically
what I liked...</i>

28:04.232 --> 28:05.797
<i>yes, I signed it.</i>

28:16.244 --> 28:20.437
He admits driving the car
and taking a right on Inwood Road...

28:22.250 --> 28:25.908
off of Interstate 35...

28:26.587 --> 28:28.379
or Highway 183.

28:31.192 --> 28:32.594
He admits driving it.

28:32.694 --> 28:36.489
After he made his right turn
on Inwood Road...

28:37.031 --> 28:39.859
<i>this is where our statement ends.</i>

28:41.903 --> 28:45.266
<i>He says he does not
remember anything after that.</i>

28:46.274 --> 28:48.476
He didn't remember anything
about a shooting.

28:48.576 --> 28:53.145
He didn't remember anything about
a police officer stopping him.

28:53.848 --> 28:57.984
That part of his mind
just conveniently went blank.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.455
He remembered driving the car...

29:00.555 --> 29:03.391
and he remembered approaching
the scene of the shooting...

29:03.491 --> 29:05.593
and then, from that point,
he blacks out...

29:05.693 --> 29:08.096
and can't remember
until he gets to the motel room...

29:08.196 --> 29:12.000
which is some 10 minutes later.
Everything else he remembers vividly.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.531
And that's just a convenient memory
lapse, is all that is.

29:20.374 --> 29:23.011
<i>The Morning News in Dallas County...</i>

29:23.111 --> 29:25.246
stated that I had signed a confession...

29:25.346 --> 29:27.949
that I had confessed
to the killing of Robert Wood...

29:28.049 --> 29:31.343
and they had their killer
and they were ready to go with it.

29:32.887 --> 29:37.114
<i>The statement that I signed
for Dallas County...</i>

29:38.926 --> 29:40.094
was never...

29:40.194 --> 29:44.490
and never would have been anything
as "a confession."

29:45.399 --> 29:47.658
But yet, they labeled it as such.

29:48.503 --> 29:52.571
<i>Of course, I couldn't dispute this
because I didn't even know about it.</i>

29:53.141 --> 29:57.245
I heard no news.
I knew nothing for two weeks.

29:57.345 --> 30:00.241
They kept me completely away
from everybody.

30:04.051 --> 30:08.389
Several times we talked to her,
trying to get her to recall.

30:08.489 --> 30:12.627
"Do you recall the license number?
Do you recall anything to help us?"

30:12.727 --> 30:15.396
And she gave us
a pretty good description of the car.

30:15.496 --> 30:18.995
As it turned out, her description
of the car was real close.

30:27.942 --> 30:30.611
It comes out that we weren't
looking for a blue Vega.

30:30.711 --> 30:33.038
We were looking for a Comet.

30:35.349 --> 30:39.178
No telling the man-hours
we literally wasted...

30:39.453 --> 30:41.177
looking for a blue Vega.

30:47.295 --> 30:50.658
There is a difference
between a Vega and a Mercury Comet.

30:50.998 --> 30:54.531
So in reality, in regard to cars...

30:54.635 --> 30:58.236
every piece of information
that was called in...

30:58.639 --> 31:02.673
they were calling in regard to a Comet,
I mean, a Vega.

31:11.385 --> 31:14.255
The people that called in were truthful,
trying to help.

31:14.355 --> 31:16.958
They really were trying to help.

31:17.058 --> 31:19.556
We just all had the wrong information.

31:40.648 --> 31:43.451
There wasn't a mark on this car
David Harris had stolen.

31:43.551 --> 31:45.116
Wasn't a mark.

31:45.253 --> 31:48.013
Do you think a car sitting still...

31:48.823 --> 31:52.857
starting from a stop,
heading up a hill...

31:53.060 --> 31:54.996
with a woman standing right behind it...

31:55.096 --> 31:57.298
<i>that is a very good shot
with a pistol...</i>

31:57.398 --> 32:00.301
She should have hit
the damn thing one time. She didn't.

32:00.401 --> 32:04.205
I wish to God she had blown whoever
was driving the car's head off...

32:04.305 --> 32:06.666
because I wouldn't have been here.

32:10.144 --> 32:12.046
I went back several times...

32:12.146 --> 32:15.616
and with Mr. Cunningham,
he and I both searched...

32:15.716 --> 32:20.216
and could find no indications that
that car had been hit by gunfire.

32:22.123 --> 32:24.992
Later on, he finally found one place...

32:25.092 --> 32:28.591
that he felt as though
that a bullet had been creased on it.

32:28.763 --> 32:32.797
But before he could tell me about it,
his daughter totaled the car out.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.826
<i>Totally demolished it.</i>

32:38.572 --> 32:42.299
I was doing burglaries
and some robberies...

32:44.178 --> 32:46.981
and a few possession cases
and stuff like that.

32:47.081 --> 32:49.283
I think he just came up to me and said:

32:49.383 --> 32:52.987
"Are you Edith James?
I'd like to talk about my case."

32:53.087 --> 32:55.482
That's the way I remember it, anyhow.

32:55.756 --> 32:58.993
And I said, "Sure."
And I said, "What sort of a case is it?"

32:59.093 --> 33:01.829
<i>He said, "It's a capital
murder." And I said...</i>

33:01.929 --> 33:03.497
Inside, I kind of thought:

33:03.597 --> 33:07.927
"I've never done one,
but I can surely talk to him about it."

33:10.371 --> 33:13.199
I hate to be considered...

33:14.075 --> 33:18.678
some kind of dummy that believes
in the innocence of her clients.

33:19.714 --> 33:22.583
A lot of people think,
"A woman lawyer...

33:22.683 --> 33:26.649
"she's bound to stupidly believe
anything she's told."

33:28.155 --> 33:30.823
I admit, I'm sort of a gullible person.

33:31.158 --> 33:34.362
But on the other hand,
I've seen an awful lot of people...

33:34.462 --> 33:37.265
who admitted guilt
or were found guilty...

33:37.365 --> 33:42.093
and all but Randall turned out
to be guilty, in my opinion.

33:45.139 --> 33:47.933
<i>Douglas Mulder had a perfect win record.</i>

33:49.677 --> 33:53.814
<i>I believe he resigned from the
D.A. 's office without any defeats.</i>

33:53.914 --> 33:55.945
<i>That's why he's legendary.</i>

33:56.951 --> 34:00.354
Everything, as I recall,
that Mulder ever said...

34:00.454 --> 34:02.523
was about what a great guy Mulder was...

34:02.623 --> 34:06.816
<i>and how marvelous it was that
he was getting all these convictions.</i>

34:08.862 --> 34:13.226
<i>I wanted somebody else in on it,
so I got Dennis interested in it...</i>

34:13.768 --> 34:16.270
because Dennis has a lot more
trial experience...

34:16.370 --> 34:19.539
and Dennis wins
practically all of his jury cases.

34:19.639 --> 34:23.476
And Dennis was very enthusiastic
about the Randall Adams case...

34:23.577 --> 34:25.713
because he kept saying,
"This is one we can win.

34:25.813 --> 34:29.880
"They don't have substantial evidence.
All they've got is David Harris."

34:30.150 --> 34:34.583
I prepared a motion for a continuance
to get more time to try the case...

34:35.255 --> 34:39.860
and in doing that had to lay out
my schedule for several weeks...

34:39.960 --> 34:42.685
as to exactly what time
I'd be in Vidor, Texas.

34:43.097 --> 34:47.034
<i>Vidor is the headquarters of the
Ku Klux Klan for the state of Texas.</i>

34:47.134 --> 34:50.103
<i>It's a city where black people
will not spend the night.</i>

34:50.204 --> 34:54.362
<i>Black people won't even stop there
to get their car filled with gasoline.</i>

34:54.708 --> 34:57.778
<i>And furthermore, the people of Vidor
were under the impression...</i>

34:57.878 --> 35:01.047
<i>that the policeman that was murdered
was a black man.</i>

35:02.049 --> 35:04.149
<i>I had to stop at a motel on the way.</i>

35:04.285 --> 35:07.521
My wife and I stayed in one room,
the lady lawyer in another room.

35:07.621 --> 35:12.087
We arranged to get up very early,
go to Vidor and start our investigation.

35:12.526 --> 35:14.717
At about 6:00 in the morning...

35:15.196 --> 35:17.887
Edith James, the lady lawyer, got up...

35:18.632 --> 35:20.801
and was looking for me.

35:20.901 --> 35:24.405
While she went out in the parking lot
to find me, she went to one room...

35:24.505 --> 35:26.140
and someone in the parking lot said:

35:26.240 --> 35:28.442
"If you're looking
for the lawyer from Dallas...

35:28.542 --> 35:31.045
<i>"he's in room..."
And he gave her the room number.</i>

35:31.145 --> 35:32.847
I immediately began to suspect...

35:32.947 --> 35:37.174
from the time I was that close to Vidor,
I was being followed and observed.

35:38.018 --> 35:40.688
<i>Doug Mulder had been there
the week before I had...</i>

35:40.788 --> 35:43.354
<i>and had told the people
in Vidor that I was...</i>

35:43.524 --> 35:46.921
an Eastern-educated
civil liberties attorney...

35:47.361 --> 35:51.930
and that I was down there
to discredit David Harris.

35:54.401 --> 35:58.039
And then I had been recommended
to see one particular policeman...

35:58.139 --> 36:01.942
who had been led
to the solution of this case.

36:02.042 --> 36:03.944
And I had the impression...

36:04.044 --> 36:07.645
that he was the one honest policeman
I could trust in Vidor.

36:08.749 --> 36:12.319
<i>He told me that
after the policeman was killed...</i>

36:12.419 --> 36:14.622
David Harris went back to Vidor.

36:14.722 --> 36:18.592
But before he was arrested,
he committed a robbery down there...

36:18.692 --> 36:22.763
and had someone on the floor
of a 7-Eleven type of store...

36:22.863 --> 36:24.758
with a shotgun at her throat.

36:25.366 --> 36:27.056
Got back there...

36:28.068 --> 36:31.704
robbed O'Bannion's 7-Eleven
with a.22 rifle.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.873
Committed some other burglaries
and what have you.

36:36.110 --> 36:39.746
All this time I was on probation.
Juvenile probation.

36:41.782 --> 36:45.577
Eventually I turned myself in
for this stuff in Vidor.

36:51.091 --> 36:55.227
I think I made a confession.
I can't even remember exactly.

36:55.696 --> 36:57.295
So I'm told I did.

37:04.371 --> 37:06.740
He had told us he had robbed stores,
and we laughed.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.642
"Sure, we know you have."

37:08.742 --> 37:10.744
I'd given him one of my hats.

37:10.844 --> 37:13.848
It's an old Bonnie-and-Clyde-looking
hat, it's turned sideways.

37:13.948 --> 37:17.151
<i>We said, "We'll draw you a little
mustache, walk in with that gun.</i>

37:17.251 --> 37:19.646
<i>"Nobody'll know who you are."</i>

37:19.753 --> 37:23.791
About 2:00 that morning,
I was asleep and the phone rings.

37:23.891 --> 37:27.161
I said, "Hello?" He said, "This is
David." "This is David Harris?"

37:27.261 --> 37:29.830
"Yeah," he said, "I did it.
Will you come and get me?"

37:29.930 --> 37:32.325
I said, "I'm not coming to get you.
I'm asleep."

37:36.637 --> 37:38.702
He didn't have a conscience.

37:39.940 --> 37:42.743
If I do something bad,
it kind of gets to me.

37:42.843 --> 37:46.809
I feel, "Shucks, I shouldn't have done
that. I feel bad about it."

37:47.414 --> 37:50.549
But it didn't bother him.
Didn't bother him at all.

38:06.066 --> 38:08.769
<i>We asked the D.A. In Vidor, Texas...</i>

38:08.869 --> 38:11.372
what they were going to do
with little David. They said:

38:11.472 --> 38:14.175
"We'll send him
to the Texas Youth Council."

38:14.275 --> 38:16.210
And we sort of tried to inquire...

38:16.310 --> 38:19.847
didn't he think it was strange
that there was a robbery committed...

38:19.947 --> 38:21.582
with that same pistol.

38:21.682 --> 38:24.851
And here it was David Harris' pistol...

38:25.019 --> 38:29.178
David Harris' automobile
that picked up Randall Adams.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.492
Didn't he think it was a little odd...

38:31.592 --> 38:35.729
that all the utensils for committing
this so-called murder...

38:35.829 --> 38:39.733
were furnished by David Harris
who got off scot-free...

38:39.833 --> 38:42.603
and was being a witness
for the prosecution?

38:42.703 --> 38:47.397
And all he said was, "We don't
feel that way in Vidor, Texas.

38:47.708 --> 38:49.610
<i>"Our people just are not that...</i>

38:49.710 --> 38:54.142
"We're not that keen
on ruining a young man's life."

38:57.117 --> 39:00.321
I tried to introduce
the crime spree theory.

39:00.421 --> 39:03.920
The theory that David Harris
was on this series of crimes...

39:04.024 --> 39:06.827
both before and after
the killing of the policeman.

39:06.927 --> 39:09.789
That he would be the person who had...

39:09.930 --> 39:13.361
the heart filled with malice
most apt to commit a murder.

39:13.767 --> 39:17.562
<i>But the judge would not allow me
to introduce any of those crimes.</i>

39:18.872 --> 39:21.233
<i>They'd had a 28-year-old man.</i>

39:21.775 --> 39:25.012
The only alternative
would be prosecuting a 16-year-old...

39:25.112 --> 39:28.249
that could not be given
the death penalty under Texas law...

39:28.349 --> 39:30.574
where our 28-year-old man could.

39:32.519 --> 39:35.889
That's always been the predominant
motive, in my opinion...

39:35.989 --> 39:39.215
for having a death penalty case
against Randall Adams.

39:39.526 --> 39:42.162
Not that they had him so dead to rights.

39:42.262 --> 39:44.396
But just that he was a convenient age.

39:49.203 --> 39:51.639
<i>The judge is supposed to have said...</i>

39:51.739 --> 39:55.500
That Don Metcalfe
is supposed to have said...

39:55.743 --> 39:59.113
to Jeanette White,
Dennis White's wife...

39:59.213 --> 40:02.041
"What do you care? He's only a drifter."

40:05.853 --> 40:07.254
I grew up in a family...

40:07.354 --> 40:10.785
where I was taught a great respect
for law enforcement.

40:11.191 --> 40:14.595
I became acutely aware of the dangers...

40:14.695 --> 40:18.365
that police officers go through,
law enforcement officials go through...

40:18.465 --> 40:23.102
that I think much of the public
is not really sensitive to.

40:24.638 --> 40:26.273
<i>My father was an FBI man.</i>

40:26.373 --> 40:29.643
<i>Probably at the worst possible time
to be in the FBI.</i>

40:29.743 --> 40:33.970
<i>It was from 1932 to 1935 in Chicago.</i>

40:34.982 --> 40:39.346
<i>He was at the Biograph Theater
the night that Dillinger was killed.</i>

40:41.855 --> 40:45.592
<i>It was a hot summer evening.
Little air conditioning in Chicago...</i>

40:45.692 --> 40:47.883
<i>and people were out for a walk.</i>

41:03.744 --> 41:06.780
<i>My father would tell me
that when Dillinger was killed...</i>

41:06.880 --> 41:08.349
<i>within a matter of two minutes...</i>

41:08.449 --> 41:11.379
<i>people were dipping their
handkerchiefs in the blood...</i>

41:11.552 --> 41:13.287
to get souvenirs.

41:13.387 --> 41:15.456
And he vividly remembered one lady...

41:15.556 --> 41:18.859
who, all she had was a newspaper,
held it up and said:

41:18.959 --> 41:23.425
"I bet I'm the only lady from Kansas
City with John Dillinger's blood."

41:27.501 --> 41:29.896
<i>He told me, the "Woman in Red"...</i>

41:30.337 --> 41:33.640
she had on an orange dress.
This is trivia, okay?

41:33.740 --> 41:36.777
It looked red under the lights.
He said it was really orange.

41:36.877 --> 41:40.581
So she got to be known as the
"Lady in Red" that fingered Dillinger.

41:40.681 --> 41:43.441
<i>He said, "It was really
the Lady in Orange."</i>

41:44.318 --> 41:47.354
As her reward, she got a new fur coat...

41:47.454 --> 41:51.055
and a one-way ticket
back to her native Romania.

41:58.732 --> 42:03.028
His whole story
from the start was two hours late.

42:03.837 --> 42:07.438
I met this kid
at around 10:00 in the morning.

42:07.541 --> 42:09.868
He says we met at noon.

42:10.544 --> 42:14.615
I say we were at the Bronco Bowl
at 2:00 or 3:00.

42:14.715 --> 42:16.906
<i>He says it was 5:00 or 6:00.</i>

42:18.385 --> 42:22.521
Everything that we did coincide with,
he was two hours late.

42:23.924 --> 42:28.458
<i>Two hours later.
Two hours into the night.</i>

42:29.930 --> 42:32.199
<i>His testimony is that...</i>

42:32.299 --> 42:35.935
<i>as we were getting off the freeway
on Inwood Avenue...</i>

42:36.169 --> 42:38.872
he stated that I'm driving the car...

42:38.972 --> 42:40.833
that we're pulled over.

42:40.974 --> 42:44.803
He gets scared and he slumps down
in the seat of the car.

42:54.788 --> 42:56.979
<i>That, as the officer walks up...</i>

42:57.624 --> 43:02.454
<i>and shines his flashlight,
and I roll down my window...</i>

43:06.533 --> 43:09.167
I pull the pistol out
and blow this man away.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.144
<i>His testimony is...</i>

43:17.244 --> 43:20.174
when I finally do drive to the motel...

43:20.380 --> 43:23.684
I get out. I tell him,
"Don't worry about it.

43:23.784 --> 43:25.918
"Forget this ever happened."

43:26.820 --> 43:28.419
<i>That's crazy.</i>

43:31.692 --> 43:34.094
The police officer
was killed at 12:30...

43:34.194 --> 43:37.557
which is about two and a half hours
after he last saw me.

43:41.702 --> 43:43.570
<i>Just before he went into the motel...</i>

43:43.670 --> 43:46.206
he'd gone across the motel courtyard...

43:46.306 --> 43:49.543
to a little store over there
and bought some cigarettes.

43:49.643 --> 43:53.280
And I was supposed to go and find out
if the man remembered him...

43:53.380 --> 43:57.573
coming in there just before 10:00
to buy the cigarettes.

43:58.018 --> 44:01.745
I didn't get over there
to Fort Worth for a long time.

44:02.255 --> 44:06.448
<i>We got some pictures from his family
that didn't show him in jail clothes.</i>

44:06.960 --> 44:10.926
<i>I took the pictures in to show them
to the man behind the counter.</i>

44:11.698 --> 44:14.924
<i>He was very cooperative
and he wanted to help us.</i>

44:15.135 --> 44:16.637
<i>But he honestly... He said:</i>

44:16.737 --> 44:19.506
"I don't remember anything
about this guy coming in there...

44:19.606 --> 44:23.744
"I couldn't tell one night from another.
Might have been that night or another.

44:23.844 --> 44:26.274
"Cause they were always coming
for cigarettes."

44:26.480 --> 44:27.942
His brother...

44:30.017 --> 44:31.377
at first...

44:34.054 --> 44:38.281
was saying that at the time
of the murder, that he was home...

44:39.526 --> 44:44.186
watching... I believe it was
a wrestling match on TV.

44:44.765 --> 44:49.299
And he said, "Me and my brother likes
wrestling matches. He was with me.

44:49.569 --> 44:52.306
<i>"Randall, my brother,
was with me all night long.</i>

44:52.406 --> 44:54.301
<i>"He couldn't have done it."</i>

44:54.841 --> 44:57.475
<i>He was trying to cover for his brother.</i>

44:58.879 --> 45:02.378
Later, as I recall, he changed...

45:03.350 --> 45:05.245
because he said:

45:05.919 --> 45:09.247
"If I get down there
and perjure myself...

45:09.456 --> 45:12.559
"there's nothing that they can do
because they've got the case."

45:12.659 --> 45:15.259
This is the way I think that he thought.

45:16.730 --> 45:18.765
"They know that my brother did it.

45:18.865 --> 45:22.970
"If I get up there and lie,
they are going to have me for perjury.

45:23.070 --> 45:26.640
"I'll be in the penitentiary with him,
and it ain't going to do any good...

45:26.740 --> 45:30.143
"so I just ain't going to testify.
I ain't gonna say nothing."

45:30.243 --> 45:33.435
So he backed off
of his story completely...

45:35.082 --> 45:37.773
and Adams was left
without any witnesses.

45:43.924 --> 45:47.361
Her in-court testimony
and her original statement...

45:47.461 --> 45:48.929
which should be the best.

45:49.029 --> 45:51.632
You're talking 15 to 20 minutes
after the killing.

45:51.732 --> 45:54.765
Should be the best eyewitness
testimony she's got.

45:55.869 --> 45:58.503
It doesn't match. Doesn't match at all.

46:16.189 --> 46:18.325
<i>In court, she testified...</i>

46:18.425 --> 46:21.617
he got out of the car,
she got out of the car.

46:21.928 --> 46:25.359
She positioned herself
at the back of the automobile.

46:38.945 --> 46:42.444
Her original statement,
15 minutes after the killing...

46:42.649 --> 46:45.252
<i>"a fur-lined collar on the killer."</i>

46:45.352 --> 46:49.454
<i>In court,
"It might have been bushy hair."</i>

46:49.990 --> 46:53.326
The kid testified
that I had a Levi jacket on...

46:53.426 --> 46:56.963
which is the same type collar,
basically the same as this.

46:57.063 --> 47:00.934
He testified at pretrial
that he had a fur-lined parka.

47:01.034 --> 47:03.168
She's telling you who killed the man.

47:03.403 --> 47:06.697
<i>One person in the car
with the fur-lined collar.</i>

47:18.051 --> 47:21.521
Very convenient that the driver
happened to have bushy hair.

47:21.621 --> 47:24.891
All she's got to do
is look at a picture they took of me.

47:24.991 --> 47:27.194
But that is not her original statement.

47:27.294 --> 47:31.225
It's a hell of a big difference
from "fur-lined collar" to "bushy hair."

47:32.165 --> 47:33.491
<i>It's crazy.</i>

47:37.103 --> 47:39.539
She went through
two weeks Internal Affairs...

47:39.639 --> 47:41.908
when she comes out,
her testimony changes.

47:42.008 --> 47:45.278
She goes in saying one thing,
she comes out saying another.

47:45.378 --> 47:47.080
Something happened. What?

47:47.180 --> 47:50.144
"We refreshed her memory."

47:56.990 --> 47:59.926
Friday afternoon,
I think it was Good Friday...

48:00.026 --> 48:02.996
we came back in the courtroom
that afternoon...

48:03.096 --> 48:05.766
<i>and we were sort of elated
because we thought...</i>

48:05.866 --> 48:07.761
<i>"He's gonna walk."</i>

48:08.602 --> 48:10.871
And there's nothing really
in that evidence.

48:10.971 --> 48:14.374
There's just little David Harris,
and nobody believes him.

48:14.474 --> 48:17.544
And so we were very optimistic
about his chances...

48:17.644 --> 48:19.279
until we walked into the courtroom...

48:19.379 --> 48:22.549
and here were all these people
standing in front of the bench.

48:22.649 --> 48:24.180
Three of them, anyway.

48:24.284 --> 48:27.351
<i>They were taking the oath
to be sworn as witnesses.</i>

48:28.355 --> 48:32.184
<i>Mrs. Miller got on the stand
that last afternoon.</i>

48:32.592 --> 48:36.663
And she said,
"That's the man, I saw that man!

48:36.763 --> 48:40.200
<i>"I saw Randall Adams' face
just right after..."</i>

48:40.300 --> 48:44.271
She said, "I saw the gun
sticking out of the car...

48:44.371 --> 48:48.308
"when he shot that police officer.
And that's the man."

48:48.408 --> 48:50.911
And she waved her finger
right toward Randall Adams.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.475
<i>She's the one that got him convicted.</i>

48:54.447 --> 48:57.384
When I was a kid,
I used to want to be a detective...

48:57.484 --> 49:00.312
because I used to watch
all the detective shows on TV.

49:04.090 --> 49:07.987
<i>When I was a kid they used to show
these movies with Boston Blackie...</i>

49:12.198 --> 49:14.298
<i>and he always had a woman with him.</i>

49:15.802 --> 49:18.538
I wanted to be a wife of a detective
or be a detective...

49:18.638 --> 49:20.863
so I always watched detective stories.

49:25.178 --> 49:28.515
I'm always looking because
I never know what might come up.

49:28.615 --> 49:30.016
Or how I could help.

49:30.116 --> 49:33.376
I like to help in situations like that.

49:34.054 --> 49:35.380
I really do.

49:39.125 --> 49:41.328
It's always happening to me,
everywhere I go...

49:41.428 --> 49:44.764
lots of times there's killings
or anything.

49:44.864 --> 49:47.055
Even around my house. Wherever.

49:47.267 --> 49:51.836
I'm always looking or getting involved,
to find out who did it, what's going on.

49:59.913 --> 50:01.381
I listen to people.

50:01.481 --> 50:05.242
And I'm always trying to decide
who's lying, or who killed who...

50:05.852 --> 50:08.680
before the police do.
See if I can beat them.

50:09.422 --> 50:10.611
Yeah.

50:23.069 --> 50:26.864
<i>I was working at a gas station.
My husband and I both.</i>

50:28.742 --> 50:31.206
<i>We weren't getting along well at all.</i>

50:32.112 --> 50:34.047
We were arguing back and forth.

50:34.147 --> 50:38.418
We didn't wanna go home, because
we'd rather talk it out in the car...

50:38.518 --> 50:40.220
than go home with the kids and fight.

50:40.320 --> 50:41.953
Had to listen to them, too.

50:42.555 --> 50:46.521
<i>So we were really arguing,
and decided to get something to eat.</i>

50:47.427 --> 50:50.664
About that time,
a police came out of a restaurant...

50:50.764 --> 50:52.898
on the right hand side of the road...

50:53.533 --> 50:56.566
<i>and he went to pull the man over.</i>

51:04.944 --> 51:08.113
She turned around.
She was looking hard. She looked.

51:09.315 --> 51:11.952
I didn't think she seen the guy,
but she did.

51:12.052 --> 51:15.588
Because I said, "What you looking at?"
I knew something had went wrong.

51:15.688 --> 51:17.913
She said, "You just shut up and drive."

51:20.326 --> 51:24.155
And I kept telling my husband:
"Slow down so I can see."

51:24.497 --> 51:27.434
He said, "Come on,
we're getting out of here.

51:27.534 --> 51:30.897
"You're too nosy.
You don't even know what's going on."

51:32.906 --> 51:37.042
I had no idea that somebody
was gonna get killed or shot.

51:37.677 --> 51:39.344
So I just drove on.

51:42.415 --> 51:46.186
He was one of these kind
that didn't like getting involved.

51:46.286 --> 51:50.286
He wanted to go on. He told me
to shut up and turn around. Don't look.

51:50.757 --> 51:53.084
I turned around and looked anyway.

51:58.398 --> 52:02.796
So we heard something,
like backfire or firecrackers.

52:03.503 --> 52:06.506
And so we drove over the bridge,
and I got to thinking.

52:06.606 --> 52:10.537
I said: "Em, there're no firecrackers
this time of the year."

52:14.881 --> 52:16.416
I was thinking to myself:

52:16.516 --> 52:20.208
"That couldn't be somebody shooting."

52:24.591 --> 52:27.360
It was real dark, and it was cold.

52:27.460 --> 52:29.753
It was hard to see in that car.

52:30.396 --> 52:34.555
But his window was down.
The driver's window was down.

52:35.802 --> 52:37.867
This is how I got such a good look.

52:45.378 --> 52:47.881
I really couldn't see anything inside.

52:47.981 --> 52:51.785
It was kind of... shadows on the window
and stuff.

52:51.885 --> 52:55.588
But when he rolled down the window,
what made his face stand out so.

52:55.688 --> 52:57.480
The car was dark blue.

53:01.961 --> 53:05.565
He had a beard, mustache...

53:05.665 --> 53:07.765
kind of dishwater-blond hair.

53:09.969 --> 53:13.969
But, like I said, when he was in court,
he sure looked a lot different.

53:15.475 --> 53:19.236
All I could just tell by this and this,
that it was him.

53:22.282 --> 53:25.952
I knew that there was
some shots over there.

53:26.052 --> 53:28.188
But I didn't want to be
involved in it...

53:28.288 --> 53:30.890
because West Dallas
is a high-crime neighborhood.

53:30.990 --> 53:32.258
One of the biggest.

53:32.358 --> 53:34.753
He was more scared of it than I was.

53:35.795 --> 53:38.665
But when you have
black people like that...

53:38.765 --> 53:41.501
they don't like
getting involved in nothing.

53:41.601 --> 53:43.236
That's just common.

53:43.336 --> 53:47.097
Like here, nobody wants
to see nothing or hear nothing.

53:47.774 --> 53:50.443
And they'll stay completely
in the background.

53:50.543 --> 53:53.179
That's why they were having
such a hard time there...

53:53.279 --> 53:55.682
finding anybody that would come forward.

53:55.782 --> 53:58.314
Because it was in
a totally black neighborhood.

54:02.322 --> 54:07.221
<i>She believe in, see somebody done
something wrong she should tell it.</i>

54:08.161 --> 54:10.352
'Cause she told on me...

54:15.068 --> 54:16.792
a couple of times...

54:17.870 --> 54:20.766
that I was hauling drugs out of El Paso.

54:21.441 --> 54:25.008
Called the sheriff down there,
going to make me open my trunk.

54:26.446 --> 54:29.672
So I ended up opening it,
but there was nothing in it.

54:35.388 --> 54:36.850
Good grief.

54:37.557 --> 54:41.557
She's a ho, but she find out
you done something, she turn you in.

54:48.501 --> 54:51.638
Mrs. Miller had testified
at the trial...

54:51.738 --> 54:55.141
that she had gotten off early from her
gas station job...

54:55.241 --> 54:59.012
and gone down to pick up her husband
to help him with the bookwork.

54:59.112 --> 55:02.515
We found out that she was not doing
any bookkeeping for that station...

55:02.615 --> 55:06.319
because she had been fired
from her job two weeks earlier...

55:06.419 --> 55:08.610
for till-tapping, for stealing.

55:09.555 --> 55:13.059
<i>The reason that they were
talking to the police at all...</i>

55:13.159 --> 55:16.963
was that there'd been a three-day
running knife fight in their apartment.

55:17.063 --> 55:18.932
And they were all booked...

55:19.032 --> 55:21.901
for disorderly
and drunk behavior in there...

55:22.001 --> 55:25.659
including assault with knives,
and all kinds of stuff.

55:25.838 --> 55:29.876
When they were at the police station,
they suddenly decided to volunteer...

55:29.976 --> 55:32.412
all this information
about what they had seen...

55:32.512 --> 55:35.044
<i>about the police officer's killing.</i>

55:36.516 --> 55:38.684
A woman called me at my home...

55:39.018 --> 55:40.653
and said that she knew this woman...

55:40.753 --> 55:44.090
who had testified and identified
Randall Adams from a passing vehicle.

55:44.190 --> 55:46.551
This woman had never told the truth
in her life.

55:51.164 --> 55:54.734
<i>She also told me that she had tried
to call the D.A. During the trial...</i>

55:54.834 --> 55:58.171
and give this evidence
that this woman was not believable.

55:58.271 --> 56:02.430
If their case hinged on this testimony,
this was not believable testimony.

56:02.542 --> 56:05.575
They were scum. They were just...

56:08.481 --> 56:09.782
actually scum.

56:09.882 --> 56:12.642
<i>He was a black man
and she was a white woman.</i>

56:12.885 --> 56:15.178
<i>He came to work the day after.</i>

56:16.322 --> 56:20.627
He told me about the policeman
that had gotten shot the night before.

56:20.727 --> 56:22.862
And I hadn't heard anything about it.

56:22.962 --> 56:26.154
<i>And I thought
it was another one of these stories.</i>

56:26.999 --> 56:29.394
<i>And he brings in these newspapers...</i>

56:29.602 --> 56:34.671
and he says he didn't see a thing.
He couldn't see nothing, it was dark.

56:35.074 --> 56:37.970
<i>Wheels started rolling
in his head about money.</i>

56:41.080 --> 56:43.111
<i>That's when he got the idea.</i>

56:44.283 --> 56:46.152
Let me put it in his words.

56:46.252 --> 56:49.216
For enough money, he would testify...

56:49.422 --> 56:51.852
to what they wanted him to say.

56:52.024 --> 56:54.927
He would say anything
they wanted him to say.

56:55.027 --> 56:58.754
Or he would see anything
that they wanted him to see.

56:59.399 --> 57:01.066
Those were his words.

57:04.337 --> 57:07.640
I was shocked that he did go ahead...

57:07.740 --> 57:11.137
and get up and tell
that he saw the actual shooting...

57:12.612 --> 57:15.610
and recognized the boy. Identified him.

57:16.849 --> 57:20.576
<i>That's when I called Dennis White.
I told him, "That man's lying."</i>

57:22.755 --> 57:25.947
Nobody has that good of an eyesight.

57:30.763 --> 57:34.490
From where the policeman was shot
and from where they were at...

57:36.836 --> 57:39.971
I doubt if you could have
even seen them with binoculars.

57:44.110 --> 57:45.743
<i>I'm a salesman.</i>

57:45.945 --> 57:48.705
<i>And you develop
something like total recall.</i>

57:49.715 --> 57:52.850
I don't forget places, things...

57:54.287 --> 57:55.613
or streets.

57:56.322 --> 57:59.158
Because it's a habit,
something I just picked up.

57:59.258 --> 58:02.894
I just stare intensely at people
and try to figure them out.

58:04.464 --> 58:07.724
<i>Being nosy, I just stare.</i>

58:10.603 --> 58:13.203
<i>I was leaving the Plush Pub one night...</i>

58:13.873 --> 58:18.806
driving a 1977 Cadillac...

58:19.779 --> 58:21.810
<i>heading west on Hampton.</i>

58:22.014 --> 58:25.513
I noticed an officer had
two individuals pulled over...

58:25.785 --> 58:28.510
to the curb in a blue...

58:28.921 --> 58:31.021
<i>some type of vehicle.</i>

58:31.891 --> 58:34.025
<i>It was a blue...</i>

58:35.728 --> 58:39.386
It was a blue Ford.
It was a blue something.

58:42.668 --> 58:46.472
The driver, I think, had long blond hair
and a moustache.

58:46.572 --> 58:49.639
And the other one
didn't have no hairs on his face.

58:54.146 --> 58:57.850
<i>A person that is white
going through that area at night...</i>

58:57.950 --> 59:01.517
he's a sore thumb,
he stick out for the first reason.

59:01.988 --> 59:05.157
And if they don't look right,
they're gonna stop you.

59:08.060 --> 59:10.956
<i>The officer,
he walked up to the vehicle.</i>

59:12.598 --> 59:14.133
<i>His car was behind...</i>

59:14.233 --> 59:16.436
I don't know
if it was behind or in front...

59:16.536 --> 59:20.194
but I know he had him pulled over,
and he was up to the car.

59:21.207 --> 59:24.171
I think he was up to the car.
Let me think.

59:24.677 --> 59:26.936
Yeah, he was up to the car.

59:27.580 --> 59:30.749
As we was coming by
he had to have been up to the car.

59:38.658 --> 59:41.461
I didn't see no bullet.
I didn't see no gunfire.

59:41.561 --> 59:43.422
Because I went on.

59:58.344 --> 01:00:02.571
We have three people
that testified and identified him...

01:00:02.848 --> 01:00:06.984
positively as being the driver
at the time that Wood was walking...

01:00:07.153 --> 01:00:08.877
right beside the car.

01:00:09.288 --> 01:00:12.792
So we know that he was the driver
from the witnesses...

01:00:12.892 --> 01:00:14.427
and we also know...

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:17.719
that it was the driver
that shot Officer Wood...

01:00:17.964 --> 01:00:19.756
coming from his partner.

01:00:20.466 --> 01:00:22.468
<i>We couldn't have made a case...</i>

01:00:22.568 --> 01:00:25.538
<i>with the voluntary statement
that we got from Adams.</i>

01:00:25.638 --> 01:00:27.965
We had to rely on witnesses.

01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:30.202
And this is what we did.

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:35.002
I always tried very hard,
every judge I know of does...

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.609
to not show emotion on the bench.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.386
The reason, if you do show emotion...

01:00:40.486 --> 01:00:44.281
the jury might take it that
you're favoring one side or another.

01:00:44.624 --> 01:00:49.124
So you try to remain passive,
emotionless, objective.

01:00:49.295 --> 01:00:52.098
I do have to admit
that in the Adams case...

01:00:52.198 --> 01:00:54.033
and I've never really said this...

01:00:54.133 --> 01:00:57.803
Doug Mulder's final argument
was one I'd never heard before.

01:00:57.903 --> 01:01:00.840
About the "thin blue line" of police...

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.734
that separated the public from anarchy.

01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:08.314
I have to concede that there
my eyes kind of welled up...

01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:09.982
when I heard that.

01:01:10.082 --> 01:01:13.581
It did get to me emotionally,
but I don't think I showed it.

01:01:36.008 --> 01:01:37.903
<i>In death penalty cases...</i>

01:01:38.511 --> 01:01:41.180
we have a question,
or we did at the time...

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.984
of whether or not that person
is of a dangerous mentality...

01:01:45.084 --> 01:01:47.878
and might be expected
to commit other crimes.

01:01:48.854 --> 01:01:50.783
<i>To answer that question...</i>

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:55.795
<i>the Dallas District Attorney sends
psychiatrists to the defendant's cell...</i>

01:01:55.895 --> 01:01:58.030
to discover
whether he is without remorse...

01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:01.959
and therefore is a dangerous
and psychopathic personality.

01:02:02.268 --> 01:02:04.737
Of course,
in the instance of a person...

01:02:04.837 --> 01:02:09.303
who did not commit the crime,
they're not going to show remorse.

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:12.678
<i>There were two psychiatrists
that appeared again and again.</i>

01:02:12.778 --> 01:02:15.913
<i>Holbrook and Grigson,
the "Killer Shrinks."</i>

01:02:16.716 --> 01:02:21.148
There was certain criticism
directed against these two people...

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:27.593
because, in effect, whenever they
showed up, the purpose of their visit...

01:02:27.693 --> 01:02:29.884
was to kill the defendant.

01:02:30.529 --> 01:02:34.460
It was April 15th, tax day.

01:02:35.768 --> 01:02:38.604
I think I was filling out
my taxes at the time.

01:02:38.704 --> 01:02:40.531
Afraid I might be late.

01:02:42.108 --> 01:02:44.299
A guard walks up to the door...

01:02:44.443 --> 01:02:48.044
tells me, "There's someone out here
who wants to talk to you."

01:02:49.882 --> 01:02:52.251
I ask him who it was.
He said he didn't know...

01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:55.488
but the court ordered me to talk
to him. I said, "All right."

01:02:55.588 --> 01:02:59.417
<i>And here come this real tall,
ostrich-looking dude.</i>

01:02:59.892 --> 01:03:03.152
<i>He introduced himself as Dr. Grigson.</i>

01:03:04.363 --> 01:03:07.400
He pulled a pad out
of his coat pocket...

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.998
that had a line drawn across it.

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:14.429
On this pad, on the upper half...

01:03:14.607 --> 01:03:17.105
he had six images.

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.546
I will say a box, a square,
a circle with a diamond in it.

01:03:20.646 --> 01:03:23.314
<i>I don't... It's been awhile.</i>

01:03:24.283 --> 01:03:28.180
<i>He slides this piece of paper across
to me and he hands me a pencil.</i>

01:03:28.287 --> 01:03:31.081
<i>He says,
"I'm going to get a cup of coffee.</i>

01:03:31.323 --> 01:03:34.083
<i>"Please copy
what's on this piece of paper."</i>

01:03:36.996 --> 01:03:39.790
I'm looking at this man.

01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:43.936
I said, "What? You want it copied
just the same way you did?

01:03:44.036 --> 01:03:47.139
"Or you want me to change them
around? What do you want me to do?"

01:03:47.239 --> 01:03:49.842
He said, "Just do
whatever you think you want to do."

01:03:49.942 --> 01:03:51.268
And he left.

01:03:52.478 --> 01:03:55.314
So on the bottom half
of this piece of paper...

01:03:55.414 --> 01:03:58.484
I made my boxes and X's...

01:03:58.584 --> 01:04:01.275
and zeros with diamonds in it.
Exactly like his.

01:04:04.323 --> 01:04:05.991
He asked me...

01:04:06.091 --> 01:04:10.250
"What's the meaning of
'A rolling stone gathers no moss?"'

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:13.159
I'm looking at this man.

01:04:13.299 --> 01:04:16.602
I said, "Are you kidding? Is this
a joke? What are you doing?"

01:04:16.702 --> 01:04:20.497
He said, "No, I really want to know
your answer to that question."

01:04:21.674 --> 01:04:24.610
I said, well,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss."

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:26.844
I said, "To me...

01:04:27.012 --> 01:04:31.342
"it would represent that a person
that doesn't stand still long enough...

01:04:31.851 --> 01:04:34.485
"it's kind of hard for people
to cling to him.

01:04:34.587 --> 01:04:38.450
"If he keeps moving around,
it's hard to get close to him."

01:04:38.891 --> 01:04:40.490
He shook his head.

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:44.923
He said, "What about 'A bird in
the hand is worth two in the bush"'?

01:04:45.531 --> 01:04:49.468
I said, "If you have a hold of
something, why give it up...

01:04:49.568 --> 01:04:52.738
"for a chance of getting something
that might be a little better?

01:04:52.838 --> 01:04:56.408
"It doesn't make sense. You've got
something good, why let go of it?

01:04:56.508 --> 01:04:58.878
"If you can get the other one,
get it if you can...

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:02.705
"but don't let go of what you got
to try to get something else."

01:05:03.215 --> 01:05:06.018
He asked about my family.

01:05:06.118 --> 01:05:08.343
He asked about my background.

01:05:09.688 --> 01:05:11.150
And he left.

01:05:12.324 --> 01:05:15.288
Total time we had talked,
maybe 15, 20 minutes.

01:05:17.963 --> 01:05:22.401
Dr. Grigson was up there testifying
he would commit violent crimes...

01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:24.794
in the future if he was released.

01:05:24.904 --> 01:05:29.241
Grigson is known as "Dr. Death"
because he always testifies that way.

01:05:29.341 --> 01:05:31.343
<i>In about 99% of the trials...</i>

01:05:31.443 --> 01:05:34.647
<i>that he's been a witness for the
prosecution, he always testifies...</i>

01:05:34.747 --> 01:05:38.212
<i>that they will commit
violent crimes in the future.</i>

01:05:38.884 --> 01:05:42.485
<i>You can't tell what
somebody's gonna do years from now.</i>

01:05:42.888 --> 01:05:44.214
<i>Not really.</i>

01:05:45.424 --> 01:05:48.684
<i>Except based on your past record,
which anybody can do.</i>

01:05:53.198 --> 01:05:55.525
Randall never had any prior record.

01:05:55.968 --> 01:05:59.899
And as far as we know, he never had
any history of violence whatever.

01:06:01.974 --> 01:06:05.075
Grigson testified for...

01:06:05.644 --> 01:06:08.870
two and a half hours
about all these degrees he's got.

01:06:09.615 --> 01:06:12.978
He's been here, and he's been there,
and he's studied here.

01:06:13.852 --> 01:06:16.043
He called me Charlie Manson.

01:06:16.221 --> 01:06:18.616
He called me Adolf Hitler.

01:06:18.991 --> 01:06:21.557
He said I'm the type of personality...

01:06:21.994 --> 01:06:25.027
that can work all day
and creep all night.

01:06:26.932 --> 01:06:29.396
He testified, Grigson...

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.541
that the future seriousness...

01:06:37.776 --> 01:06:39.637
of my mental state...

01:06:40.145 --> 01:06:42.381
would be such
that if they released me...

01:06:42.481 --> 01:06:45.317
I would go crazy and
probably butcher half of Dallas County.

01:06:45.417 --> 01:06:48.245
Even though he talked to me
15 minutes...

01:06:48.654 --> 01:06:52.458
I have no prior convictions,
no prior arrests...

01:06:52.558 --> 01:06:55.294
I was nonviolent for 28 years.

01:06:55.394 --> 01:06:56.729
On one instance...

01:06:56.829 --> 01:07:00.055
and that's saying if I did this,
which I didn't...

01:07:00.399 --> 01:07:04.436
<i>he's stating that, that's enough...
For the rest of my life, watch me.</i>

01:07:04.536 --> 01:07:08.570
Don't ever turn your back on me.
And he talked to me 15 minutes.

01:07:10.976 --> 01:07:12.200
He's crazy.

01:07:16.548 --> 01:07:19.852
You can understand why a man
might steal if he needs money...

01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:22.780
to put food on the table.

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:26.292
I can understand why a 17-year-old
boy who doesn't have a car...

01:07:26.392 --> 01:07:28.227
would steal one to ride around in.

01:07:28.327 --> 01:07:31.553
I can understand
why the heroin addict needs heroin.

01:07:31.797 --> 01:07:35.990
But it's very hard to understand
why anybody has to kill a police officer.

01:07:36.201 --> 01:07:38.198
It just doesn't have to be.

01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:51.450
When I'm asleep
and I close my eyes and think...

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:52.818
"Why would he do it?

01:07:52.918 --> 01:07:55.354
"He had no background
that would lead to murder...

01:07:55.454 --> 01:07:57.656
"no reason to commit a murder."

01:07:57.756 --> 01:08:00.652
And I look at the facts
of the case and say...

01:08:01.126 --> 01:08:04.396
David Harris knew the car was stolen,
knew the guns were there...

01:08:04.496 --> 01:08:05.965
knew the guns were stolen...

01:08:06.065 --> 01:08:08.233
was on a crime spree...

01:08:08.434 --> 01:08:12.071
had had a criminal record prior to
stealing this car and these guns.

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:14.473
He was the one
that wanted to commit the murder...

01:08:14.573 --> 01:08:15.874
and get away from the scene.

01:08:15.974 --> 01:08:18.410
He was the one that,
after the murder was committed...

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:21.872
went right back home
and bragged about it to his friends.

01:08:23.482 --> 01:08:25.673
I looked at all the evidence...

01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:29.676
and I found that I believed
that David Harris committed murder.

01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:33.421
The jury looked at the same evidence...

01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:36.590
and found they believed that
Randall Adams committed murder.

01:08:36.795 --> 01:08:39.225
<i>And it was their verdict that counted.</i>

01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:05.912
You have a D. A...

01:09:07.526 --> 01:09:09.627
he doesn't talk about...

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:12.988
when they convict you
or how they convict you...

01:09:14.133 --> 01:09:17.325
he's talking about
how he's going to kill you.

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:20.439
He don't give a damn if you're innocent.

01:09:20.538 --> 01:09:24.140
He don't give a damn if you're guilty.
He's talking about killing you.

01:09:31.517 --> 01:09:34.412
<i>You get numb. You get...</i>

01:09:35.554 --> 01:09:39.712
It's like a bad dream. You want
to wake up, but you can't do it.

01:09:44.462 --> 01:09:48.033
Fifteen times, 20 times a day,
I hear this same story...

01:09:48.133 --> 01:09:50.961
about what happens
when a man is electrocuted.

01:09:53.205 --> 01:09:55.007
His eyeballs pop out.

01:09:55.107 --> 01:09:56.909
His fingernails pop out.

01:09:57.009 --> 01:09:58.733
His toenails pop out.

01:09:58.977 --> 01:10:01.645
He bleeds out of every orifice he's got.

01:10:08.187 --> 01:10:09.786
<i>They don't care...</i>

01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:12.921
They don't care.

01:10:14.226 --> 01:10:17.396
All they want to do is talk about
how they're going to kill you.

01:10:17.496 --> 01:10:21.063
That's the only thing that they cared
about and talked about.

01:10:23.268 --> 01:10:25.800
At that point,
that's all they're wanting.

01:10:31.343 --> 01:10:34.774
I didn't have any idea
what happened to him.

01:10:36.515 --> 01:10:38.876
<i>After I testified, I was gone.</i>

01:10:40.085 --> 01:10:43.812
<i>I never really concerned myself with it.</i>

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:51.551
Maybe I didn't want to know.
I don't know.

01:10:52.698 --> 01:10:55.300
I didn't have any interest in knowing...

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.068
otherwise I might have tried
to find out.

01:11:01.807 --> 01:11:03.775
<i>Dennis filed the motion
for a new trial...</i>

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:06.044
<i>then we filed an amended motion
for a new trial.</i>

01:11:06.144 --> 01:11:09.108
<i>About 20 days later,
we were to have a hearing on it.</i>

01:11:09.748 --> 01:11:12.751
<i>Both Robert Miller and his wife
testified there.</i>

01:11:12.851 --> 01:11:14.853
But we could not bring out the fact...

01:11:14.953 --> 01:11:18.557
that they had said that they were
gonna get that reward money...

01:11:18.657 --> 01:11:21.860
and that they didn't care
whether they saw anything or not...

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.651
but their car was too steamed up.

01:11:25.797 --> 01:11:27.833
We were not allowed
to get any of that in...

01:11:27.933 --> 01:11:30.469
because it was held
that it was impeaching testimony...

01:11:30.569 --> 01:11:32.704
and therefore it came too late.

01:11:32.804 --> 01:11:35.666
<i>We kept running into blank walls.</i>

01:11:37.909 --> 01:11:40.412
<i>A reporter
from the Dallas Morning News...</i>

01:11:40.512 --> 01:11:44.773
discovered that one week
after the trial was over with...

01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:49.121
the daughter of this woman
had a robbery case in this court.

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:50.756
<i>She offered her testimony...</i>

01:11:50.856 --> 01:11:54.193
<i>at a time when her daughter
was in danger of going to jail for life...</i>

01:11:54.293 --> 01:11:56.428
<i>and got her daughter out of jail.</i>

01:11:56.528 --> 01:11:58.330
How can you believe her...

01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:01.963
when the very next week
the same judge dismisses that case?

01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:08.840
The Millers are the kind of people
that would do anything...

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.438
if there was something to be gained...

01:12:11.943 --> 01:12:15.681
such as her daughter not being sent
to the penitentiary for armed robbery...

01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:17.448
or for money.

01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:22.154
<i>When we went to court that day,
the District Attorney was hard-nosed.</i>

01:12:22.254 --> 01:12:24.786
<i>Wouldn't let me answer any questions.</i>

01:12:25.190 --> 01:12:28.826
He'd ask me questions,
but then he'd cut me off real short.

01:12:29.895 --> 01:12:32.598
And that's when he said something
about my big fat nose.

01:12:32.698 --> 01:12:35.167
If I'd kept my big fat nose
out of their business...

01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:37.492
the Millers would be better off.

01:12:39.471 --> 01:12:41.707
<i>When I started to leave
out of the courtroom...</i>

01:12:41.807 --> 01:12:44.209
he started laughing, like:

01:12:44.309 --> 01:12:46.745
"Didn't do you any good to get up here."

01:12:46.845 --> 01:12:49.775
It really didn't.
Didn't help the guy at all.

01:12:57.656 --> 01:12:59.091
To the best of my recollection...

01:12:59.191 --> 01:13:01.493
the brief conversations
I have had with Mr. Adams...

01:13:01.593 --> 01:13:03.262
and they have been brief...

01:13:03.362 --> 01:13:07.089
I don't even recall ever asking him,
or my having told me...

01:13:07.499 --> 01:13:09.257
that he did not do it.

01:13:10.969 --> 01:13:14.434
Because, for my purposes,
representing him on appeal...

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.035
<i>it's totally irrelevant.</i>

01:13:20.645 --> 01:13:23.473
When the Court of Criminal Appeals
of Texas...

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:29.221
voted 9-0 against us,
I was a little upset about that.

01:13:29.321 --> 01:13:31.323
I felt we, A: Should have won...

01:13:31.423 --> 01:13:33.859
B: Certainly shouldn't have been
slapped so hard...

01:13:33.959 --> 01:13:36.252
with the unanimous decision against us.

01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:41.867
I was with my family
in an ice-cream parlor...

01:13:41.967 --> 01:13:45.762
and the judge and his family
happened to come at the same time.

01:13:46.104 --> 01:13:49.933
And he came over to me
and made the comment...

01:13:51.576 --> 01:13:55.940
"I see where the Court of Criminal
Appeals gave me an 'A'...

01:13:56.114 --> 01:13:57.906
"in the Adams case."

01:13:58.083 --> 01:14:00.252
Our highest state appellate court...

01:14:00.352 --> 01:14:04.613
the Court of Criminal Appeals
in Austin affirmed the case, 9-0.

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:08.750
Then it was reversed by the
United States Supreme Court, 8-1...

01:14:10.362 --> 01:14:13.326
When the Appellate Court
reverses a case...

01:14:13.765 --> 01:14:17.423
they are never saying
the trial judge was right or wrong.

01:14:17.869 --> 01:14:20.629
They are saying
they disagree with the judge.

01:14:21.673 --> 01:14:24.576
You can't, for instance,
in the Adams appeals...

01:14:24.676 --> 01:14:28.647
say the appellate courts
were saying I was right or I was wrong.

01:14:28.747 --> 01:14:31.973
After all, if in Austin...

01:14:32.184 --> 01:14:35.220
in our state appeals court,
I was 9-0 correct...

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.751
and in Washington, I was 1-8 incorrect.

01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:42.127
If you tally all those votes,
I come out 10-8.

01:14:42.227 --> 01:14:44.258
<i>Yet the case was reversed.</i>

01:14:46.431 --> 01:14:51.227
Eight justices of the Supreme Court
were the first people to agree with me.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:56.041
They're the only people anywhere
that ever agreed about that statute...

01:14:56.141 --> 01:14:58.809
<i>were eight justices
of the Supreme Court.</i>

01:15:00.912 --> 01:15:05.515
<i>The Dallas Morning News
had a very nice front-page story...</i>

01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:08.353
either the same day...

01:15:08.453 --> 01:15:11.923
or the day after the reversal was
announced by the Supreme Court...

01:15:12.023 --> 01:15:15.283
in which Henry Wade,
the District Attorney...

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.451
<i>vowed a retrial of Randall Dale Adams...</i>

01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:22.534
<i>because there was no room
in his book for a cop-killer...</i>

01:15:22.634 --> 01:15:25.997
<i>getting off with anything less
than the death penalty.</i>

01:15:26.738 --> 01:15:30.305
I took that to heart. I thought
I was going to get my chance.

01:15:31.476 --> 01:15:35.168
For reasons
that were never really made public...

01:15:36.314 --> 01:15:39.117
Mr. Wade requested
the governor to commute...

01:15:39.217 --> 01:15:42.147
Mr. Adams' death penalty to life...

01:15:42.921 --> 01:15:46.625
and that eliminated
the possibility of a retrial...

01:15:46.725 --> 01:15:48.256
based on the reversal.

01:15:50.595 --> 01:15:52.524
<i>I was absolutely shocked.</i>

01:15:52.797 --> 01:15:54.266
I can't help but believe...

01:15:54.366 --> 01:15:57.169
that some of the motivation
behind that decision...

01:15:57.269 --> 01:15:58.959
was a fear that...

01:15:59.571 --> 01:16:02.569
Adams may be vindicated at a retrial.

01:16:03.542 --> 01:16:07.200
I just felt they prosecuted
the wrong person. I don't know why.

01:16:07.712 --> 01:16:11.871
I felt that some policeman,
whether in Vidor or in Dallas...

01:16:11.983 --> 01:16:16.788
made a decision to prosecute and set
the wheels of justice in motion...

01:16:16.888 --> 01:16:20.625
in the wrong direction and they got
going so fast no one could stop them.

01:16:20.725 --> 01:16:23.462
So I felt it was up to me
to stop them and I didn't.

01:16:23.562 --> 01:16:27.666
I felt it was up to the Supreme Court
and they did what they could, but...

01:16:27.766 --> 01:16:30.958
it's all gotten messed up
and derailed again.

01:16:32.437 --> 01:16:37.131
<i>Since his trial, I have given up
my practice of criminal law.</i>

01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:42.013
I have not had a jury trial...

01:16:42.113 --> 01:16:45.183
since I heard the verdict
of this jury in this case...

01:16:45.283 --> 01:16:47.508
and don't intend to.

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.755
I just feel like...

01:16:50.855 --> 01:16:55.287
I'll let other people
handle these problems for a while.

01:16:57.262 --> 01:17:01.057
Because if justice
can miscarry so badly...

01:17:01.933 --> 01:17:04.067
I'd rather do something else.

01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:08.069
Prosecutors in Dallas
have said for years...

01:17:08.573 --> 01:17:11.367
"Any prosecutor can convict
a guilty man.

01:17:11.843 --> 01:17:14.841
"It takes a great prosecutor
to convict an innocent man."

01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:20.619
To this day, I think Mr. Mulder...

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:25.583
believes that the Adams conviction
was one of his great victories...

01:17:26.424 --> 01:17:31.084
probably because of some reservations
he has about Adams' guilt.

01:17:37.068 --> 01:17:40.237
I got a call one morning,
a lady here in Vidor...

01:17:40.472 --> 01:17:43.402
had been hit over the head
with a rolling pin...

01:17:44.376 --> 01:17:47.943
and the attacker thought
she'd been knocked unconscious...

01:17:48.079 --> 01:17:49.614
when, in reality, she wasn't.

01:17:49.714 --> 01:17:52.781
And she recognized the attacker
to be David Harris.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.582
He voluntarily
came to the police station.

01:17:59.491 --> 01:18:02.394
I told him,
"David, this girl knows who you are.

01:18:02.494 --> 01:18:04.763
"I don't even have to tell you
I know the truth.

01:18:04.863 --> 01:18:06.565
"You know I know the truth this time."

01:18:06.665 --> 01:18:11.436
He said, "I was wrong.
I smoked marijuana, I was drinking.

01:18:11.536 --> 01:18:14.573
"I don't know what got over me
but something just came over me."

01:18:14.673 --> 01:18:18.741
<i>But he forgot to mention one thing,
that he was only wearing underwear.</i>

01:18:21.246 --> 01:18:23.882
I felt as though
the attack was sexually oriented.

01:18:23.982 --> 01:18:26.051
He never wanted to admit that...

01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:29.354
and, as I recall,
he never really finally admitted it.

01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:31.815
He'd just get
to where he wouldn't deny it.

01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:34.656
<i>He posted his bond and went to Germany.</i>

01:18:36.361 --> 01:18:39.197
We had a crime
with basically the same M.O. As his...

01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:43.524
and so it led me to want to check
and see if he was in town.

01:18:43.702 --> 01:18:46.738
I contacted
the Worldwide Military Locator...

01:18:46.838 --> 01:18:49.207
to see if, through the military,
I could locate him.

01:18:49.307 --> 01:18:52.533
<i>I did, and found out
that he was in prison at the time.</i>

01:18:53.344 --> 01:18:55.146
<i>He really didn't remember what happened.</i>

01:18:55.246 --> 01:18:57.315
<i>He said he woke up in the stockade...</i>

01:18:57.415 --> 01:19:01.019
<i>and he'd been told that he beat up
one of his ranking officers.</i>

01:19:01.119 --> 01:19:05.156
We had another occasion to have
a crime that fit his M.O. A lot...

01:19:05.256 --> 01:19:08.159
so I started looking for him again,
and this time...

01:19:08.259 --> 01:19:10.128
I found him in prison in California.

01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:13.865
<i>So I realized again that unfortunately,
he hadn't straightened up.</i>

01:19:13.965 --> 01:19:15.996
<i>He was still having a lot of problems.</i>

01:19:24.409 --> 01:19:26.304
I was 16 years old.

01:19:27.145 --> 01:19:31.475
I really didn't have no real dealings
with the court systems, etc.

01:19:32.717 --> 01:19:35.112
Didn't know how they worked, really.

01:19:35.253 --> 01:19:37.444
Didn't know much about the law.

01:19:38.356 --> 01:19:39.887
<i>Just a young, dumb kid.</i>

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.697
Police give you the time of this
and the time this happened...

01:19:45.797 --> 01:19:48.099
and you just correlate
from those events.

01:19:48.199 --> 01:19:51.493
You just estimate from that event
what time it was.

01:19:52.137 --> 01:19:53.634
<i>You don't know.</i>

01:19:53.972 --> 01:19:55.764
<i>You're taking a guess.</i>

01:19:57.709 --> 01:20:01.436
<i>Police tell you, "It was 12:30
when this crime happened.</i>

01:20:07.318 --> 01:20:09.645
<i>"What time did you leave the movie?"</i>

01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:12.689
<i>"I know it was somewhere
around midnight.</i>

01:20:17.962 --> 01:20:20.198
<i>"It might have been before then.
I don't know.</i>

01:20:20.298 --> 01:20:22.432
<i>"I didn't have a watch on."</i>

01:20:33.978 --> 01:20:38.137
<i>He went over my testimony with me
pretty extensively.</i>

01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:42.351
How I should answer certain questions...

01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:46.057
things of this nature.

01:20:46.157 --> 01:20:49.383
That's what you call
"coaching the witness."

01:20:49.727 --> 01:20:54.227
<i>Let's get this evidence in a spectrum
where it's going to be most effective.</i>

01:21:00.905 --> 01:21:04.973
At the time,
I didn't really ponder on it...

01:21:10.281 --> 01:21:14.315
but he was deceiving the jury.
He wanted to deceive justice.

01:21:14.586 --> 01:21:18.289
That's why I think
that statue with the scales...

01:21:18.389 --> 01:21:21.854
Justice? What is she called?
I don't know what she's called.

01:21:22.493 --> 01:21:24.388
She's got that blindfold on.

01:21:25.063 --> 01:21:28.061
<i>We don't see what goes on
behind the closed doors.</i>

01:21:29.334 --> 01:21:31.627
<i>I had another woman in the car.</i>

01:21:32.437 --> 01:21:35.840
<i>I didn't tell them about that.
My wife'd kill me.</i>

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:40.311
She would've tore my head off if she
knew I was out with another woman.

01:21:40.411 --> 01:21:42.169
Would you tell?

01:21:42.947 --> 01:21:46.082
That's what happened.
I was trying to get her home.

01:21:49.053 --> 01:21:51.517
The driver's side was down because...

01:21:52.223 --> 01:21:55.688
the lady was a little sick.
She needed some air.

01:21:56.027 --> 01:21:58.422
Because she was pretty drunk.

01:22:06.471 --> 01:22:08.873
<i>See, the Millers,
one is black and one is white.</i>

01:22:08.973 --> 01:22:12.610
<i>They said I was going with...
The reason I was over that night...</i>

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:14.946
I was over there
messing with this man's wife.

01:22:15.046 --> 01:22:19.046
<i>And I ain't never gone with her in
my life. She was too old and ugly.</i>

01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:23.922
Like I said, the D.A. Will
put something into their mouth.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:26.850
They could have
prefabricated the whole story.

01:22:28.359 --> 01:22:29.561
They sure could have.

01:22:29.661 --> 01:22:32.330
But what I saw is just what I saw.
That was it.

01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:35.565
So if they got paid,
they got paid for lying.

01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:42.139
They already decided
what to do with you in the hall.

01:22:42.373 --> 01:22:46.511
That's why they call it the Hall of
Justice, the scales are not balanced.

01:22:46.611 --> 01:22:49.547
The scales are in the hall,
and they go up and down.

01:22:49.647 --> 01:22:54.079
They might go up for you, favor one
way, they might go down against you.

01:22:54.385 --> 01:22:58.612
<i>So if the D.A. Wants you to hang
15 or 20 years, you're hung.</i>

01:23:01.359 --> 01:23:04.858
I had all these charges
still pending in Orange County.

01:23:08.733 --> 01:23:11.424
I could have been certified
as an adult...

01:23:12.236 --> 01:23:15.337
maybe given a life sentence.
I don't know.

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.000
I'm 16 years old.
I know I don't want that.

01:23:20.578 --> 01:23:24.373
<i>That District Attorney told me,
"Don't worry about them charges."</i>

01:23:24.816 --> 01:23:29.248
<i>"I'm gonna ask your...
Defense Attorney is gonna ask you...</i>

01:23:29.387 --> 01:23:31.987
"if you had any kind of deal...

01:23:32.857 --> 01:23:35.252
"or anything of that nature...

01:23:36.127 --> 01:23:39.228
"in exchange for your testimony
in this case...

01:23:39.497 --> 01:23:41.722
"as relating to those charges.

01:23:44.102 --> 01:23:48.033
"Don't answer that 'Yes.'
Answer it 'No."'

01:23:53.011 --> 01:23:55.907
My husband,
he didn't get that good a look at him.

01:23:58.549 --> 01:24:02.617
He wasn't sure, because they put
a bunch of them that looked alike.

01:24:03.955 --> 01:24:07.292
<i>They had about three or four
in the lineup that had bushy hair...</i>

01:24:07.392 --> 01:24:11.551
but he had his combed down,
different to what it was in the killing.

01:24:12.363 --> 01:24:14.999
I didn't pick him out right then...

01:24:15.099 --> 01:24:17.563
because I picked out
this bushy-haired man.

01:24:20.838 --> 01:24:25.372
I understand one other witness
did pick out the man at the lineup.

01:24:26.077 --> 01:24:28.336
I'm not sure, but I think he did.

01:24:28.546 --> 01:24:32.113
Of course I picked out
Randall Adams just like that.

01:24:33.951 --> 01:24:36.085
I don't know about the others.

01:24:36.954 --> 01:24:39.679
Evidently they did at that time.

01:25:02.547 --> 01:25:04.305
<i>I just took off.</i>

01:25:05.283 --> 01:25:07.151
It's like, kids run away...

01:25:07.251 --> 01:25:09.821
they don't think about
where they're going to stay...

01:25:09.921 --> 01:25:13.420
how they're going to eat,
all these things.

01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:19.130
They had that roof over their head
all their lives.

01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:21.466
They don't really think
about those things...

01:25:21.566 --> 01:25:25.133
till you get out there and you say,
"My stomach's growling now."

01:25:26.671 --> 01:25:29.999
<i>Or, "It's getting cold out here.
It's raining."</i>

01:25:34.011 --> 01:25:35.880
<i>There was ice on the road.</i>

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:40.674
I remember there was a car coming
pretty fast up the road behind me...

01:25:41.419 --> 01:25:44.122
and didn't see me or something...

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:47.759
or was in one lane and came into
the other lane and I was in that lane...

01:25:47.859 --> 01:25:50.595
and tried to stop me.
He went off the side of the road.

01:25:50.695 --> 01:25:53.031
I remember this car
went off the side of the road.

01:25:53.131 --> 01:25:55.356
I'm just looking back.

01:25:59.704 --> 01:26:01.428
I remember that.

01:26:06.944 --> 01:26:10.307
I got a call at my house
about 3:30 one morning.

01:26:10.815 --> 01:26:13.384
One of the patrolmen
in my department called...

01:26:13.484 --> 01:26:17.188
and said, "We just arrested
this boy named David Harris...

01:26:17.288 --> 01:26:21.025
"and he won't even tell us his name.
He said he wants to talk to you."

01:26:21.125 --> 01:26:25.125
<i>They told me something that really
made me interested. He'd been shot.</i>

01:26:25.530 --> 01:26:29.757
David had initially told me
that he had gone to a bar in Houston...

01:26:31.169 --> 01:26:35.139
and was flirting with a young lady
and her boyfriend became upset...

01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:39.432
and chased him out with a pistol,
shooting at him.

01:26:42.113 --> 01:26:44.042
<i>We knew that wasn't true.</i>

01:26:44.148 --> 01:26:46.684
I said,
"David, I know you're lying to me.

01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:50.977
"We go through this all the time,
all my dealings with you in the past.

01:26:51.389 --> 01:26:53.291
"I don't know what you've done just yet.

01:26:53.391 --> 01:26:54.592
"I know you were shot.

01:26:54.692 --> 01:26:57.995
"I know you were shot doing something
that you shouldn't have been...

01:26:58.095 --> 01:27:01.966
<i>"we know you burglarized a gun shop.
We know you were driving drunk.</i>

01:27:02.066 --> 01:27:06.637
"Got witnesses who can identify you,
who can identify your truck."

01:27:06.737 --> 01:27:10.168
I said, "You're caught.
So tell the truth."

01:27:10.341 --> 01:27:12.736
And David said, "Okay, I killed him."

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:20.473
<i>Their home was entered while he
and his girlfriend were there alone.</i>

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:26.520
<i>The man was sent into the bathroom
at gunpoint and told to stay there.</i>

01:27:29.093 --> 01:27:32.353
<i>David took the girl
and was starting to leave.</i>

01:27:33.097 --> 01:27:36.130
<i>The man exited the apartment with a gun.</i>

01:27:37.902 --> 01:27:40.304
The man fell to the ground,
or near the ground...

01:27:40.404 --> 01:27:44.041
holding onto a pole there in the
parking lot of the apartment complex...

01:27:44.141 --> 01:27:47.778
and these last, whether it be two,
three, or how many shots...

01:27:47.878 --> 01:27:51.673
I don't know, were fired at point-blank
or near point-blank range.

01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:59.123
David thought that the one
that was really at fault that night...

01:27:59.223 --> 01:28:02.260
was the guy that got killed.
He said, "That guy's crazy.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.828
"He came after me with a gun."

01:28:03.928 --> 01:28:06.464
I told him,
"David, you'd broken into his house...

01:28:06.564 --> 01:28:09.600
"you abducted his girlfriend,
what was he supposed to do?"

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:12.336
He said,
"Man shouldn't come out with a gun.

01:28:12.436 --> 01:28:15.036
"That dude's crazy.
He should have been killed."

01:28:18.009 --> 01:28:20.511
<i>When we went to retrieve the pistol...</i>

01:28:20.611 --> 01:28:22.446
I had to go into the water to get it.

01:28:22.546 --> 01:28:25.416
It was a bayou and it was grassy,
snaky-looking area.

01:28:25.516 --> 01:28:27.718
I was not real pleased
about being there myself...

01:28:27.818 --> 01:28:31.289
but David enjoyed watching me have to
go down there and look for the gun.

01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:34.956
I'd been searching several minutes,
he was up on the bridge...

01:28:35.092 --> 01:28:37.195
and probably 25 feet from me...

01:28:37.295 --> 01:28:41.761
directing me to where he thought
that the gun had landed in the water.

01:28:44.635 --> 01:28:46.037
<i>He was handcuffed.</i>

01:28:46.137 --> 01:28:49.006
Traffic would come by,
and he would turn around...

01:28:49.106 --> 01:28:52.076
and show them his handcuffs
and holler at them, "Help me!

01:28:52.176 --> 01:28:55.277
"The officials will throw me
in this water and drown me."

01:28:55.479 --> 01:28:58.416
<i>Just anything he could do
to make a joke and cut up out there.</i>

01:28:58.516 --> 01:29:00.775
<i>He was just really having a good time.</i>

01:29:04.588 --> 01:29:06.312
The kid scares me.

01:29:07.858 --> 01:29:12.119
To think that he could actually be
out there, walking the streets...

01:29:12.496 --> 01:29:14.565
and Dallas County let him go.

01:29:14.665 --> 01:29:17.390
The kid had seven crimes
coming down on him.

01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:23.033
He had armed robberies.
He had firing on a peace officer.

01:29:23.741 --> 01:29:26.677
He had breaking and enterings,
aggravated assaults.

01:29:26.777 --> 01:29:28.646
God knows what all this kid had.

01:29:28.746 --> 01:29:31.882
And Dallas County gives him
complete immunity for his testimony.

01:29:31.982 --> 01:29:33.376
Just lets him walk.

01:29:44.228 --> 01:29:46.497
<i>My mom had a good phrase.</i>

01:29:46.597 --> 01:29:50.201
She said the first night
she pulled into Dallas, it was raining...

01:29:50.301 --> 01:29:52.069
and that it was lightning.

01:29:52.169 --> 01:29:54.372
And they're coming into Dallas...

01:29:54.472 --> 01:29:58.335
and she said if there was ever
a hell on earth, it's Dallas County.

01:30:01.178 --> 01:30:02.936
She's right.

01:30:14.992 --> 01:30:19.563
You deal with people who you sense
bad vibrations, more or less.

01:30:19.663 --> 01:30:22.933
You feel, this guy doesn't like me
anyway because I'm a policeman.

01:30:23.033 --> 01:30:26.904
You can just kind of sense something.
Maybe I shouldn't even be saying it...

01:30:27.004 --> 01:30:29.940
because police shouldn't
take these things to the bank.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.700
When you deal with people over
and over, you sense a lot of things.

01:30:34.845 --> 01:30:38.845
<i>Talking to David, you don't ever
feel hostile feelings coming from him.</i>

01:30:39.717 --> 01:30:41.986
I have never seen David any way...

01:30:42.086 --> 01:30:45.722
other than cordial,
friendly to me as he could be:

01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:50.353
"Yes, sir." "No, sir."
Never disrespectful.

01:30:51.162 --> 01:30:53.597
I've never seen the bad side.
I've seen the results...

01:30:53.697 --> 01:30:56.434
and I've talked to him about it,
and he's aware of it.

01:30:56.534 --> 01:30:58.827
He remembers the bad side.

01:30:59.437 --> 01:31:02.540
But I've never seen him
committing a crime...

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:05.832
or in a violent or volatile state.

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.744
<i>When his crimes were confessed to...</i>

01:31:11.949 --> 01:31:16.381
he seemed to feel better and do better
during those times.

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:19.357
His parents would tell me
he would to do better at home...

01:31:19.457 --> 01:31:22.526
he seemed to get along better
with the people in town...

01:31:22.626 --> 01:31:24.395
his neighbors and friends.

01:31:24.495 --> 01:31:26.464
But something happens to David...

01:31:26.564 --> 01:31:30.860
I don't know what it is. I don't know
if anybody can put their finger on it.

01:31:35.973 --> 01:31:38.809
<i>But there's no other indication
of anything in the family...</i>

01:31:38.909 --> 01:31:43.045
<i>that would lead you to believe
he had exposure to these activities.</i>

01:31:49.019 --> 01:31:52.723
David's got at least one other brother
and sister that I know of.

01:31:52.823 --> 01:31:57.187
And he had one brother that drowned
numerous years ago.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.926
I was 3 years old...

01:32:06.403 --> 01:32:08.503
I had a 4-year-old brother...

01:32:08.939 --> 01:32:12.302
and he drowned in 1963...

01:32:13.477 --> 01:32:16.514
<i>right after President Kennedy
was assassinated, I believe.</i>

01:32:16.614 --> 01:32:19.339
<i>Sometime right after that,
during the summer.</i>

01:32:19.984 --> 01:32:23.415
<i>We was living in Beaumont
on Harrison Street...</i>

01:32:24.955 --> 01:32:27.988
<i>and my dad was working on his truck
out in the yard...</i>

01:32:28.459 --> 01:32:32.186
<i>and mom was in the house
doing her housework or fixing dinner.</i>

01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:37.031
<i>Me and my brother, we had
one of these little blow-up pools...</i>

01:32:38.168 --> 01:32:40.199
<i>and we were playing in that.</i>

01:32:41.038 --> 01:32:45.197
<i>My dad was supposed to be watching
or keeping an eye on us or something.</i>

01:32:45.643 --> 01:32:47.978
<i>My brother wandered off
down the street...</i>

01:32:48.078 --> 01:32:50.781
<i>and these people had a
swimming pool in their backyard...</i>

01:32:50.881 --> 01:32:53.584
<i>and they were elderly people.
They never used the pool.</i>

01:32:53.684 --> 01:32:56.682
<i>I guess it had a bunch of leaves
and stuff in it.</i>

01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:02.485
<i>And he, evidently,
fell in there and drowned.</i>

01:33:05.796 --> 01:33:10.228
I used to sit up in my room at night
and talk to him and he wasn't there.

01:33:14.004 --> 01:33:18.766
So that might have been some kind of
a traumatic experience for me.

01:33:20.744 --> 01:33:22.343
<i>I guess my dad...</i>

01:33:25.816 --> 01:33:28.886
I don't know, maybe he couldn't
get rid of the responsibility...

01:33:28.986 --> 01:33:32.087
or the guilt or something.
I don't know what it was.

01:33:33.991 --> 01:33:37.061
I was there and I guess maybe
I reminded him of that...

01:33:37.161 --> 01:33:39.329
all the time, growing up.

01:33:41.465 --> 01:33:44.225
It was hard for me
to get any acceptance from him.

01:33:46.170 --> 01:33:47.805
<i>When my younger brother was born...</i>

01:33:47.905 --> 01:33:51.973
<i>it was kind of like he was Daddy's
favorite or something, I don't know.</i>

01:33:54.745 --> 01:33:59.378
Everybody's life is going to take some
kind of path regardless of what happens.

01:34:02.453 --> 01:34:06.020
I think maybe that a lot of the things
I did when I was younger...

01:34:06.156 --> 01:34:10.759
was an attempt to get back at him
or something...

01:34:11.228 --> 01:34:13.157
for the way he treated me.

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:17.560
But I wasn't doing nothing
but hurting myself.
