00:40.376 --> 00:41.613
That was close McCord.

00:42.882 --> 00:43.882
Yes.

00:44.529 --> 00:45.917
Where we are, I would like to know?

00:47.312 --> 00:52.919
Well I think about 8 kilometers
Of the state border.

00:54.502 --> 00:58.648
Let's see we are from 96 to 104
Kilometers from the base.

01:01.309 --> 01:02.853
We have 47 minutes left.

01:03.254 --> 01:04.745
Well, here we go.

01:04.933 --> 01:06.887
Danger! Dangerous curves ahead.
Decrease to 70 km/hrs.

01:32.852 --> 01:34.209
Charlie, is he a cop?

01:34.524 --> 01:35.612
Where where?

01:35.732 --> 01:36.955
Behind us.

01:42.674 --> 01:45.946
Look at that sign, 5 kms from the border.
If you do, we're free.

01:59.678 --> 02:01.006
Faster, you want!

02:17.602 --> 02:19.243
Decrease 30 mph

02:33.856 --> 02:35.732
I lose control Charlie!

03:05.400 --> 03:08.864
In 1958, Clarksberg was known
Like the speed trap.

03:09.409 --> 03:12.489
During that year 7 people died
Trying to escape the law.

03:12.944 --> 03:17.090
And then one day a stranger
Led the people.

03:51.901 --> 03:56.521
You're entering Clarksberg, please.
drive carefully. Speed kills.

04:09.117 --> 04:11.976
Roy has everything there, less
The kitchen sink.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.538
It's good to know that it's there.
When you need it, Buzz.

05:09.344 --> 05:11.652
Sheriff, take a look at this car.

06:36.036 --> 06:37.036
How are you.

06:40.839 --> 06:42.848
It is a very showy car
That you have here ...!

06:43.441 --> 06:44.940
You can take it out, please.

06:46.794 --> 06:49.000
Do you mind if I look under the hood?

06:50.180 --> 06:51.212
Insurance.

06:58.455 --> 07:00.240
Everything and the kitchen sink!

07:02.650 --> 07:03.744
How long ago?

07:04.590 --> 07:05.917
120 in 10.

07:06.135 --> 07:08.840
120 in 10? It is true?

07:09.326 --> 07:10.496
It is true...

07:13.907 --> 07:17.015
Oh, you know the limit of
Speed here?

07:17.585 --> 07:18.643
56 km/h.

07:19.584 --> 07:21.076
Do you know how fast you were going?

07:22.057 --> 07:23.087
61 km/h.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.111
I'll take you at 64 km/h.

07:29.794 --> 07:31.063
They are their wheels.

07:31.183 --> 07:32.581
My wheels?

07:32.826 --> 07:35.922
It has big wheels, that's why
The meter marked him too much.

07:38.438 --> 07:41.891
I have heard many stories, but
I had never heard that

07:42.438 --> 07:43.660
It is true...

07:45.762 --> 07:47.452
Shut it, let's go to the station.

07:50.410 --> 07:51.410
Is seriously?

07:51.477 --> 07:52.477
Yes.

08:20.270 --> 08:22.164
Have a seat over there ...

08:33.962 --> 08:39.344
He warned us, but you never did.
He warned us, Howard ...

08:39.744 --> 08:40.553
Who warned us?

08:40.673 --> 08:41.768
The man at the desk.

08:42.028 --> 08:43.028
Which man?

08:43.527 --> 08:47.006
The man at the counter where
We stopped for coffee ...

08:47.797 --> 08:53.075
He warned us, he said that in this village
There is a famous speed trap.

08:53.619 --> 08:57.195
Said you'd know why they call it
Clarksberg and Howard,

08:57.855 --> 09:00.487
We are now in the Clarksberg prison.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.870
Let's start with this
Until the judge is ready.

09:06.516 --> 09:09.850
Relax, come into the living room
The court please

09:11.276 --> 09:13.201
I'll talk, Eve.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.605
Everybody stand up.

09:44.297 --> 09:46.660
This court is in session.

09:48.274 --> 09:50.178
Maxwell, Howard F.

09:55.751 --> 09:58.871
104 km/h in the area of 56 km/h.
Do you plead guilty or not?

09:59.291 --> 10:01.331
Your honor, I declare, that no
I am a competitor.

10:01.442 --> 10:06.205
It's the same as guilty. It will be 100 dollars
Or 10 days in the county jail.

10:06.456 --> 10:09.344
$ 100 dollars?
Wait, I did not say guilty.

10:09.853 --> 10:12.152
I want a trial, a trial of truth.

10:12.418 --> 10:14.846
It's in your right, Mr. Howard.

10:15.370 --> 10:16.925
I want to talk to my lawyer.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.260
You are free to call him.

10:22.650 --> 10:24.250
Rhodes, Charlie T.

10:29.984 --> 10:33.344
I understand, Charlie, I have to
To collect bail.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.466
Do you have $ 25 dollars?

10:44.854 --> 10:46.615
We only have $ 12 dollars.

10:47.833 --> 10:51.312
Fine Charlie, but just this once
if you understand.

10:52.649 --> 10:54.023
Yes, sir, thank you.

10:54.366 --> 10:56.619
Pay the ballot and you are free.

10:56.867 --> 10:58.872
McCord, Michael D.

11:03.207 --> 11:04.607
Well ... ah, ah.

11:05.444 --> 11:06.787
Guilty, your honor.

11:07.118 --> 11:08.494
$ 50 dollars.

11:17.059 --> 11:18.059
Thank you.

11:26.105 --> 11:30.817
Well ... what did you say, Mr. Maxwell?

11:31.256 --> 11:33.172
He said he paid $ 100.

11:41.794 --> 11:45.040
Can you tell me, sir,
How do I get back to my car?

11:45.160 --> 11:48.643
There you will find Johnny.
He will take you back.

11:48.903 --> 11:52.121
Please note that
My taxi does not have a meter.

11:52.559 --> 11:53.879
This is not a meter.

11:54.194 --> 11:56.211
I work by zones.

11:56.331 --> 11:57.739
Any questions so far?

11:57.959 --> 12:00.525
Just tell us how much it will cost us
out of here!

12:00.645 --> 12:02.147
Where are you parked, sir?

12:02.171 --> 12:03.679
I do not know, there, on the highway.

12:03.799 --> 12:09.014
Well that leads us to what I call
Zone "B" and costs 1 dollar extra.

12:10.126 --> 12:11.890
All right, now let's go.

12:12.270 --> 12:13.855
If they were in zone "A" ...

12:14.378 --> 12:17.754
It would be $ 1 for turning on the car
And $ 1 for zone "A" ...

12:17.908 --> 12:21.404
But as you are in zone "B"
It will be 1 dollar to turn it on ...

12:21.524 --> 12:25.117
$ 1 for the area "A"
And $ 1 more for zone "B".

12:25.472 --> 12:31.405
That and the initial customer price in
Gives a total of $ 3.50 each.

12:33.232 --> 12:34.491
Get out of there, Luke ...

12:35.471 --> 12:38.783
Except those who can qualify
As a special trip.

12:39.206 --> 12:42.438
Which is $ 4 dollars for the family
Complete and that's a bargain.

12:42.913 --> 12:44.242
I do not have $ 4 dollars.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.118
I'll take care of that, let's go.

12:46.878 --> 12:48.433
Okay, we're leaving.

12:54.123 --> 12:55.500
Thanks for helping us.

12:55.987 --> 12:57.449
It is a pleasure.

12:57.936 --> 12:59.472
There it is, there.

13:06.916 --> 13:12.102
I tell you, I'm leaving this town
Horrible as fast as possible.

13:13.991 --> 13:17.716
Horrible and with speed trap!
- Shut up!

13:31.906 --> 13:33.114
Charlie, good luck.

13:33.575 --> 13:34.574
Thank you.

13:35.843 --> 13:38.156
Hey, I'll go ahead with you.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.954
I do not think I'll see you again!

14:04.457 --> 14:06.537
It was a pleasure talking to you.
- How much do I owe you?

14:06.656 --> 14:07.777
Ah, $ 7.50.

14:26.767 --> 14:32.223
Here you go. - Thank you, the
State limit is 3 miles.

14:33.201 --> 14:34.201
I know.

15:11.403 --> 15:13.755
I would not if I were you, sir!

15:37.673 --> 15:38.924
Can I have a beer, Maggie?

15:39.044 --> 15:40.229
In a moment, Track.

15:41.543 --> 15:43.281
Playing that song again?

15:52.432 --> 15:56.648
They said about Carter, who has everything
The department with regular salary.

15:57.461 --> 15:59.278
We're good like this.

16:01.227 --> 16:05.493
Well, some weeks are good.
Others not, I was thinking that if ...

16:06.211 --> 16:09.443
If we had a better salary
We would count on being more regular.

16:09.650 --> 16:13.467
And taxes would rise,
People would not like that.

16:13.759 --> 16:14.759
And people vote.

16:15.436 --> 16:19.556
Better than those who break the law pay
Taxes and not taxpayers ...

16:20.097 --> 16:23.401
Is the best way to do it,
As far as I'm concerned

16:28.031 --> 16:30.918
Keep it regular, it's work
from the Department.

16:31.928 --> 16:36.491
And maybe we would make Johnny
Raise your taxi fare ... ha ha.

16:38.026 --> 16:42.156
That investigator from the tax office
Came to see me again

16:42.833 --> 16:44.500
What did he want?

16:44.674 --> 16:47.994
Oh, he asked a lot of questions.
On accidents.

16:48.694 --> 16:50.054
What did you say to him?

16:50.455 --> 16:52.069
Nothing to say.

17:34.763 --> 17:35.814
Roy.

17:35.934 --> 17:38.078
I will be another time.

17:47.494 --> 17:48.774
Hi.
- Hello.

17:48.974 --> 17:49.862
What do I serve you?

17:49.919 --> 17:51.307
Black coffee.

17:51.427 --> 17:52.427
All right.

18:38.959 --> 18:40.335
How was everything last night, Roy?

18:41.433 --> 18:44.087
Why?
I was in the church.

19:35.900 --> 19:40.236
Clarksberg's curves claim his
Sixth and seventh victim of this year.

20:05.297 --> 20:07.857
Is it a good car that brings, huh ..?

20:12.680 --> 20:15.512
Slow down
At 48 km/hrs.

23:49.824 --> 23:50.824
Hi.

23:51.231 --> 23:52.231
Hi.

23:52.310 --> 23:53.310
Everything is fine?

23:53.374 --> 23:54.374
If it is okay.

23:55.807 --> 23:57.799
It's a good car you have there!

23:58.507 --> 23:59.507
Yes.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.253
Can I ask you something, sir?

24:05.018 --> 24:06.018
Insurance.

24:07.068 --> 24:08.188
What are you trying to do?

24:09.715 --> 24:11.043
I only practice a little.

24:13.972 --> 24:16.125
Many people have died
In this curve.

24:17.175 --> 24:18.175
I heard that.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.829
I'm Loss Stafford, I live around here.

24:23.119 --> 24:25.261
I'm Michael McCord, I'm new here.

24:26.273 --> 24:27.273
See you later.

24:39.117 --> 24:40.883
Hey, I love your car ...

24:47.695 --> 23:49.516
Hello Roy, how are you?

24:54.592 --> 24:57.328
How do you write "misdemeanors"?
With an "s" or with two ...

24:58.449 --> 25:01.354
Why do not you look in the dictionary?
Over there, in the "m".

25:07.283 --> 25:08.283
One "s" or two.

25:08.803 --> 25:10.417
Do you want me to help you find something?

25:10.537 --> 25:14.647
Yes, I look for the report of the last accident,
The one of the two fatalities.

25:14.859 --> 25:17.669
Yes, I have it here.
It is not archived yet.

25:18.180 --> 25:21.163
I have enough work to
Keep me busy for a month or more!

25:30.996 --> 25:33.484
Same as the second, in the same way!

25:36.679 --> 25:37.773
McCord.

25:38.656 --> 25:41.396
Is not the same name as the
Showy car type?

25:42.347 --> 25:43.347
It is right.

25:45.217 --> 25:46.863
It's strange that he walks around here.

25:47.810 --> 25:49.364
I wonder what he wants.

25:52.581 --> 25:53.581
I do not know.

25:57.746 --> 25:59.033
I do not know.

26:04.795 --> 26:10.772
The man who breaks the law
Will pay to break the law.

26:13.710 --> 26:16.353
I do not know why he's here,
I just do not know.

26:45.377 --> 26:49.253
Buzz garage, repair
Cars and welding.

27:03.982 --> 27:06.429
Eli, get out of there, you'll scratch the paint!

27:06.929 --> 27:08.682
Pass me a 3/8 "to open the end.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.985
Hey, I'm hungry.
Let's go somewhere ...

27:12.105 --> 27:13.136
Later.

27:13.410 --> 27:16.273
I have to adjust the open end
It's not a box.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.062
Forget it, I'll take it.

27:24.199 --> 27:27.525
Hey Buzz, why do not you show your
Brother something about cars.

27:28.179 --> 27:30.916
I know enough, I have
My teachings. Or not?

27:31.183 --> 27:32.736
You do not have a car to do it.

27:33.408 --> 27:35.017
Look, learn from someone who knows.

27:35.670 --> 27:37.454
You can not do it without a car.

27:38.785 --> 27:39.785
True.

27:45.792 --> 27:47.566
Hey, you gotta see this car!

28:03.775 --> 28:05.007
Good afternoon.

28:05.356 --> 28:06.356
Hi.

28:06.515 --> 28:07.515
Can you fill it?

28:07.921 --> 28:09.449
That?
Yes.

28:09.997 --> 28:11.885
Eli, clean the windshield.

28:14.516 --> 28:15.408
You work here?

28:15.528 --> 28:17.118
Yes, he is my older brother.

28:18.103 --> 28:20.311
Fiuu ... that's something.

28:20.766 --> 28:22.315
Appearance means nothing.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.685
Pure show and no runs.

28:25.144 --> 28:26.652
Yes, you know.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.608
They were 20 liters.
- Yes I know.

28:31.939 --> 28:34.515
Do I check under the hood?
- Is not it all right, how much do I owe you?

28:35.433 --> 28:36.433
It's $ 10 dollars.

28:41.517 --> 28:43.125
Here you have.
- Thank you.

28:47.608 --> 28:50.307
Eli ... come on, come on up.

28:51.032 --> 28:51.794
Really?

28:51.914 --> 28:52.950
Sure let's go.

28:59.565 --> 29:00.952
Oh, it's rude!

29:01.228 --> 29:02.478
Want to go for a spin?

29:02.598 --> 29:03.598
Insurance!

29:03.821 --> 29:04.821
Ahead...

29:04.864 --> 29:06.736
Hey, sir, you're just learning!

29:07.076 --> 29:08.076
I have my license.

29:08.215 --> 29:09.359
I also.
- Me too.

29:18.715 --> 29:19.715
Well I ...

29:21.538 --> 29:24.453
I'm afraid you have to wear
Someone with you

29:26.259 --> 29:27.427
Jack!

29:30.625 --> 29:33.010
You know how to use the manual lever, right?
- Yes!

29:33.541 --> 29:36.429
Make sure the emergency brake
Be outside, have fun.

29:53.965 --> 29:56.189
County seizure yard.

31:28.538 --> 31:29.538
Hello...

31:35.335 --> 31:37.223
Yes, a man died in that car.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.775
Two men died in that car.

31:41.192 --> 31:43.535
Yes, you're right, two died in it.

31:43.892 --> 31:45.868
How bad those marks of push.

31:46.262 --> 31:49.005
Yes sure, I would like to save that defense.

31:49.418 --> 31:51.826
It's the only thing left of the whole car.

31:52.322 --> 31:54.105
The radio does not work and the battery
It's broken.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.996
You know when we go out we wait
Find a good one, but ...

31:58.633 --> 32:02.314
Yes ... I think you're doing well!

32:02.733 --> 32:04.173
Oh yeah.
Yes ... we are doing very well.

32:05.486 --> 32:07.606
Before you take the contract
With the county ...

32:07.659 --> 32:11.787
All we did was sell
Gasoline and tires.

32:13.048 --> 32:15.863
But it's much better now.

32:42.483 --> 32:43.483
Hello, Sheriff Roy!

32:43.850 --> 32:45.338
How is it going?
- All right.

32:46.620 --> 32:49.305
I'll tell them it's the best car
that I've seen.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.328
Sheriff Roy would dry it with
Your exhaust pipe!

32:52.657 --> 32:53.852
He has no chance ...

32:54.184 --> 32:56.566
No car around here can
Beat the California Kid.

32:56.997 --> 32:58.950
Not even Sheriff Roy's.

32:59.732 --> 33:02.572
Sheriff Roy has a racing engine
With double carburetor and all ...

33:02.923 --> 33:03.923
I installed it.

33:03.999 --> 33:08.021
Yes I know ... but still, it does not have
Opportunity against "California Kid".

33:08.698 --> 33:09.698
I'm with you, Eli.

33:09.746 --> 33:10.334
Well done, Eli!

33:10.454 --> 33:14.112
Hey, mister ... what was I doing over there?

33:16.330 --> 33:17.535
Just looking at the junk.

33:18.225 --> 33:19.659
And trying not to break the laws.

33:19.779 --> 33:22.822
- You already have, that is
Owned by the county.

33:23.497 --> 33:26.874
Oh Roy is ... it's like he says,
I was just looking.

33:28.392 --> 33:35.298
Let's see, your contract with the county
Expires in ... three months, right?

33:38.530 --> 33:42.557
Unauthorized persons are not
Allow there ... you understand?

33:43.850 --> 33:45.239
Yes sir, I understand.

33:47.134 --> 33:48.134
That is good.

33:49.442 --> 33:52.210
I like when people
understand what I say.

33:57.314 --> 33:59.126
Now keep the doors closed.

33:59.585 --> 34:01.577
Of course, yes sir.

34:32.562 --> 34:34.649
Hey boss, can you lend me
Some tools?

34:35.103 --> 34:36.399
Yes, of course, whatever you want.

34:36.518 --> 34:37.132
Thank you.

34:37.380 --> 34:38.576
Do you need a hand?

34:38.696 --> 34:39.696
If it is okay.

34:39.891 --> 34:41.987
I just want to adjust the front a bit.

34:42.327 --> 34:44.567
It is very destabilizing in the curves.
He has to put up with it.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.844
Boy, did you see anything like this?
- Do not.

34:47.039 --> 34:48.360
Hey, what's that thing for?

34:49.078 --> 34:50.090
I do not know.

34:51.114 --> 34:52.733
It's a new type of magnet.

38:03.291 --> 38:04.588
Two specials.

38:11.930 --> 38:12.996
Hello Hello.

38:13.598 --> 38:14.598
Over there.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.309
Thank you.

38:38.507 --> 38:40.677
How are the eggs?
- Fantastic.

38:43.351 --> 38:48.243
You give me two singles to the plate ...
- I like it that way too.

38:51.412 --> 38:52.533
Do you want potatoes?

38:54.713 --> 38:56.287
Mmm ... No, cottage cheese.

38:57.708 --> 38:58.708
All right.

38:59.490 --> 39:00.490
Black coffee too.

39:00.922 --> 39:01.922
Coffee.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.317
Do you work all the time?

39:09.023 --> 39:10.495
So it seems!

39:16.205 --> 39:18.059
But I'll be free when I'm done.
Your eggs

40:03.642 --> 40:04.654
Sissy Berry?

40:05.283 --> 40:07.612
Your father knows you're here,
in the middle of the night,

40:07.613 --> 40:09.213
In the back of this car?

40:10.670 --> 40:12.150
I asked you a question!

40:12.901 --> 40:15.586
We were not doing anything
Sheriff Roy, I swear ...

40:17.926 --> 40:19.510
Well, you two, get out.

40:28.867 --> 40:33.041
Are you aware of the fact that
Sissy Berry is a minor, eh?

40:33.313 --> 40:34.313
Yes sir.

40:37.632 --> 40:41.724
Contributing to an offense of abuse of
Minors is a very serious thing.

40:44.033 --> 40:45.033
All right?

40:46.030 --> 40:48.670
Oh, Sheriff Roy.
I, I ...

40:51.053 --> 40:52.377
Give me your driver's license.

40:58.751 --> 41:00.663
I have seen them grow since childhood.

41:02.302 --> 41:04.472
I do not allow this kind of thing.

41:06.541 --> 41:08.408
I'll let them go this time.

41:09.888 --> 41:10.888
Can you hear me, Tom?

41:12.329 --> 41:15.695
See me again a week later
Friday and I will return this.

41:16.624 --> 41:19.704
Until then, I'll suspend you
The privilege of driving.

41:19.971 --> 41:20.971
Yes sir.

41:25.015 --> 41:28.303
Sissy Berry, I should put you on
My knees and whip you.

41:29.075 --> 41:32.332
I'll let your father handle the next
Once I find you back in a car ...

41:32.367 --> 41:35.097
Because I will take you to the juvenile court
And you will not want that ...

41:35.575 --> 41:36.575
You understand?

41:37.392 --> 41:38.392
Yes sir.

41:39.124 --> 41:40.451
Fix that face.

41:43.174 --> 41:45.390
Now Tom, take her home.

41:46.064 --> 41:48.777
Before I check in the seat
Front and find that beer.

41:48.927 --> 41:50.687
Yes sir.
"I'll change my mind, really!"

41:50.907 --> 41:52.092
Yes sir.
- Now!

41:58.362 --> 41:59.558
And do not run.

42:00.483 --> 42:01.483
Go away now!

42:47.637 --> 42:48.637
Sheriff!

42:50.489 --> 42:51.913
It's all good, Roy.

42:53.872 --> 42:54.902
You've seen?

42:55.279 --> 42:56.279
To who?

42:57.195 --> 42:59.250
To the owner of that car.

43:00.254 --> 43:01.254
Do not.

43:04.437 --> 43:09.116
Jerry, have you seen someone come out of that
Showy machine that is outside?

43:10.998 --> 43:14.970
I do not know who, I was late here.
Maybe he was here early.

43:15.700 --> 43:20.331
Umm, I have to go.
We'll see you later, Roy.

43:54.588 --> 43:59.316
Then we sat down and
We talk one day

44:01.595 --> 44:03.707
I guess I was the
That spoke more.

44:06.103 --> 44:08.119
My husband just stopped and
He went out the door.

44:12.396 --> 44:15.173
He did not even warn me.

44:15.697 --> 44:18.161
Frank used to say that I was proud.

44:19.219 --> 44:24.074
I asked him where he was going, when he would return
And that is what I would do.

44:25.554 --> 44:27.117
And you figured out what he was doing?

44:27.421 --> 44:29.315
Yes ... of course I did.

44:31.655 --> 44:34.232
I went out every morning with
The empty lunch box.

44:34.453 --> 44:36.797
And I would go home with her
Full of money.

44:37.524 --> 44:39.050
He found a tree that gave money.

44:42.988 --> 44:45.277
Sometimes I get letters from him.

44:48.033 --> 44:49.900
Usually on my birthday.

44:52.079 --> 44:54.320
And it's always the same thing.

44:56.303 --> 44:58.041
Maggie, I love you.

44:59.558 --> 45:01.875
And I'm sure I'll look for you
When you leave.

45:08.126 --> 45:09.819
Let's listen to some music again.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.040
Thank you.

45:17.202 --> 45:19.409
You have a nice place.

45:19.768 --> 45:20.768
Thank you.

45:21.326 --> 45:22.614
Are you comfortable here?

45:22.926 --> 45:23.926
Yes.

45:48.856 --> 45:50.171
You are different.

45:50.474 --> 45:51.563
You too.

45:53.273 --> 45:55.516
The village women are
Different from those of the city.

45:55.636 --> 45:57.941
I did not mean that.

46:00.492 --> 46:01.945
I only know one thing.

46:02.244 --> 47:03.244
What is it?

46:04.846 --> 46:11.171
You're here because you have something
With Sheriff Roy Childress.

46:14.614 --> 46:16.066
So you think!

46:18.398 --> 46:23.225
Yesterday, after you left the picnic area,
He looked very worried.

46:26.969 --> 46:29.700
I had not seen it since
A long time ago.

46:32.049 --> 46:33.516
Not since the accident.

46:34.266 --> 46:35.443
What accident?

46:37.359 --> 46:39.886
Oh I do not know.
It was 5 years ago, I think.

46:41.845 --> 46:43.454
His wife Kathy and her son.

46:43.574 --> 46:44.574
What happened?

46:44.742 --> 46:45.763
They both died.

46:47.767 --> 46:49.818
On the main street, just at noon.

46:50.590 --> 46:52.043
A driver rolled over and fled.

46:55.121 --> 46:56.775
Roy hurt a lot.

47:01.420 --> 47:03.784
She swore she'd find him someday.

47:06.864 --> 47:08.710
He never did.

47:26.606 --> 47:27.314
Eli!

47:27.434 --> 47:28.434
Hello!

47:28.878 --> 47:30.046
Where is Tom?

47:30.503 --> 47:32.415
Who cares?

47:33.816 --> 47:35.761
You ... did you hear what happened to him?

47:36.529 --> 47:37.529
Do not.

47:37.991 --> 47:40.612
Tom was suspended from the license
For two weeks.

47:41.169 --> 47:42.169
Yes Yes.

47:42.545 --> 47:44.082
I do not want to be with him
anyway.

47:44.388 --> 47:46.444
Come on, let's take a seat.
- Insurance.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.240
Here.

47:54.266 --> 47:55.848
Do you have a car, Eli?

47:56.133 --> 47:57.133
I have one!

47:57.420 --> 48:01.039
Buzz gave me the old two-door.
It will be mine when I have my license.

48:05.214 --> 48:07.623
If you had one now we could
go for a walk.

48:08.202 --> 48:09.572
I know a place.

48:10.790 --> 48:13.071
I can not, Sissy.
Not until ...

48:13.191 --> 48:14.238
Forget this.

48:15.052 --> 48:17.598
Me and Tom used to go out when
I was learning.

48:18.059 --> 48:20.084
But are you afraid or something?

48:20.204 --> 48:23.254
Maybe I can in the morning,
just for a while.

48:24.488 --> 48:26.309
We can go swimming in the river.

48:26.674 --> 48:28.917
Oh, Eli, that would be great.

48:30.090 --> 48:31.090
It's okay.

48:32.302 --> 48:35.158
Well, see you around
The school at 10:00 am.

48:48.396 --> 48:50.208
You're still here!

48:50.791 --> 48:52.063
Yes, I'm still here.

48:53.079 --> 48:54.199
Enjoying this day?

48:56.501 --> 48:57.501
Yes.

48:57.659 --> 49:01.393
I want you to know that I know who you are
And what you are doing here.

49:06.463 --> 49:07.498
Anything else?

49:59.482 --> 50:00.482
Hello, Maggie.

50:00.864 --> 50:03.712
Hi Roy, come on in.
- Thank you.

50:07.266 --> 50:10.236
I was doing my round and I thought
Stop and talk to you for a minute.

50:14.306 --> 50:17.963
Do you like it here or not, Maggie?
To live here in Clarksberg?

50:19.207 --> 50:20.717
You know that, Roy.

50:21.650 --> 50:25.162
Yes it is a good place, I say ...
I've been here all my life.

50:25.996 --> 50:28.557
It's not like other towns
You know, just ...

50:29.510 --> 50:31.128
It does not change much.

50:31.649 --> 50:33.185
What are you trying to say, Sheriff?

50:35.422 --> 50:38.169
I do not want to see you again with him.

50:41.674 --> 50:45.171
We do not want them to come from outside
And start creating problems here.

50:47.877 --> 50:49.822
Now, we want you here, Maggie.

50:52.721 --> 50:54.516
I just hope you understand.

51:15.089 --> 51:16.404
Where is the radio?

51:17.681 --> 51:20.076
I just ordered a new one,
The keypad.

51:20.534 --> 51:22.114
Buttonboard? Do not make up!

51:23.751 --> 51:26.895
Listen, Eli, I know a place.
where to go...

51:27.286 --> 51:29.142
You know where people
Is parked

51:30.834 --> 51:32.977
Yes, well, maybe we can!

51:34.114 --> 51:35.730
But, just for a while.

51:36.106 --> 51:39.653
Let's go faster ...
- Give me more time!

52:21.987 --> 52:24.587
Danger. Curves closed forward.
Decrease. 45 miles.

52:26.226 --> 52:29.507
You handle very well. Eli, very well.

53:00.723 --> 53:04.699
Oh, no, it's Sheriff Roy!

53:07.843 --> 53:09.890
Quick Eli, fast!

53:10.512 --> 53:11.792
Maybe we should stop ...

53:11.864 --> 53:12.864
Do not...!

53:14.568 --> 53:16.774
I only have my learning ...!

53:23.706 --> 53:25.994
State Line 3 miles

53:26.804 --> 53:30.887
Quick! Please, Eli, you can not.
Catch me with another guy

53:32.324 --> 53:35.386
Well ... maybe we can do it?

54:04.734 --> 54:05.921
Watch out, Eli ...!

55:07.522 --> 55:08.803
Yes, it's Buzz.

55:09.039 --> 55:12.046
Yes, tell me ... I'll be there.

55:14.293 --> 55:19.301
Listen, there has been an accident with Eli,
I'm going there now.

55:20.734 --> 55:21.734
Wait!

55:34.496 --> 55:36.565
It will be OK...!

55:59.223 --> 56:03.063
She's in bad shape, Roy.
He will live, but he is in very bad shape.

56:04.489 --> 56:08.948
They must have stopped, everything would be fine
If they had stopped.

56:13.972 --> 56:15.912
It must have come like 160 km/h.

56:16.378 --> 56:17.378
Yes.

56:36.354 --> 56:37.530
Oh heavens...

56:52.132 --> 56:53.484
What happened, Roy?

56:54.964 --> 56:58.418
He came quickly and did not stop,
Lost the curve

56:58.666 --> 57:00.120
You were after him, right Roy?

57:02.011 --> 57:03.151
So is.

57:03.675 --> 57:06.195
No, Roy is my brother ... it's Eli!

57:11.021 --> 57:12.189
No, God ...

58:13.252 --> 58:14.340
Buzz ... thanks for coming.

58:19.747 --> 58:22.625
Mom is having a really bad time ...!

58:24.886 --> 58:27.454
I'm sorry...
Really, I'm so sorry...

58:27.824 --> 58:29.824
I just came to see if there's anything
That I can do.

58:30.645 --> 58:31.645
Thank you.

58:34.876 --> 58:42.186
You know ... I never thought
In them as people ...

58:44.126 --> 58:46.857
I never thought they belonged to him
tosomeone...

58:49.550 --> 58:52.478
They were only junk that I collected
For a pay, that's all.

58:55.234 --> 58:57.130
Well, I think you belonged to me.

58:58.406 --> 59:01.616
Yes, it was my younger brother,
He was 19 years old.

59:05.743 --> 59:09.118
You remember, of the marks in the defense.

59:09.642 --> 59:10.642
Bump marks.

59:10.808 --> 59:12.368
That's right ... look.

59:14.575 --> 59:17.768
You know, Roy ... Roy murdered Eli.

59:18.110 --> 59:19.110
I think he did!

59:19.183 --> 59:21.599
I'm going to kill Roy ...!
- There is no other way.

59:27.894 --> 59:28.894
Roy?

59:35.932 --> 59:37.477
Police department, Roy.

59:57.847 --> 01:00:00.339
Roy, are you all right?

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:04.766
Roy?

01:00:56.574 --> 01:00:57.574
Roy?

01:01:03.978 --> 01:01:04.978
Roy?

01:01:10.652 --> 01:01:11.829
What do you want?

01:01:12.298 --> 01:01:16.270
The judge was worried about you because
You were not in court this morning.

01:01:17.513 --> 01:01:21.467
Called me a couple of times
To see if you were well.

01:01:22.764 --> 01:01:24.842
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:27.599
Well well.

01:01:36.695 --> 01:01:41.967
I just wanted to see if you were sick
Or something, but I see that you are well.

01:01:44.191 --> 01:01:45.191
Yes.

01:02:11.149 --> 01:02:13.384
I guess I'll leave.

01:02:14.404 --> 01:02:16.004
Have you seen him, Billy?

01:02:17.264 --> 01:02:18.264
Who, Roy?

01:02:19.626 --> 01:02:21.245
You know who I'm talking about!

01:02:22.074 --> 01:02:23.593
California, the type of car.

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.071
Has been hanging around in
The village all day ...

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:28.175
Driving from top to bottom
by the road.

01:02:32.478 --> 01:02:33.662
I have to go there.

01:02:36.264 --> 01:02:37.835
He waiting for me.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.788
I guess you're leaving?

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:05.231
Yes very soon.

01:04:10.165 --> 01:04:12.079
When Frank got into trouble ...

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.848
When they came and took him away ...

01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:23.817
I felt I should go
And start over.

01:04:27.009 --> 01:04:28.568
So I sold everything we had.

01:04:28.828 --> 01:04:32.159
And ... I went out and bought that trailer.

01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:38.047
That way I started to
feel better.

01:04:40.898 --> 01:04:42.967
I felt really good.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.599
Because I knew I could go
Wherever I wanted

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.656
But I never did, Michael.

01:05:00.771 --> 01:05:02.821
I once thought I would.

01:05:04.689 --> 01:05:10.857
But when the time comes, I
It was scary, so I never left.

01:05:12.953 --> 01:05:15.440
And there I knew I would never do it.

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:22.359
I just want you to know...

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:29.154
That ... as it is and it is well.

01:05:33.234 --> 01:05:39.074
Because the time we were
Together, it was really good.

01:05:55.406 --> 01:05:56.464
Is the?

01:05:57.429 --> 01:05:58.429
Is the.

01:06:15.484 --> 01:06:18.177
I want you out of this town
Today, McCord.

01:06:24.695 --> 01:06:27.488
I'm going north on
A few minutes, sheriff.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:06.183
Well, I have to go.

01:07:18.555 --> 01:07:19.675
I'm out of here, Maggie.

01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:22.639
He will come someday.

01:07:25.618 --> 01:07:26.618
It will.

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:30.664
I think he will come and you will see.

01:08:01.394 --> 01:08:04.562
Maybe ... maybe I will.

01:10:44.998 --> 01:10:46.791
State Line 3 miles

01:11:08.608 --> 01:11:11.680
Decrease 30 mph

01:12:48.126 --> 01:12:49.566
Is there anything good there?

01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:51.805
Only the best.

01:12:52.305 --> 01:12:58.206
