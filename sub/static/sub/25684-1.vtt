00:53.887 --> 00:57.758
ELIZABETH:Last summer, I started
getting these panic attacks.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.928
My homeopath told me
I was working too hard,

01:00.961 --> 01:04.897
burning the candle at both ends.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.401
As a treatment, he recommended
that I do something creative

01:07.435 --> 01:14.775
to release negative energy,
so I painted this last fall.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.611
What do you think about...

01:17.645 --> 01:21.582
staying here from now on?

01:29.623 --> 01:32.593
I know it's only
been a couple months but...

01:36.430 --> 01:38.999
You make me so happy...

01:41.001 --> 01:44.104
I feel...

01:44.138 --> 01:47.441
Free... with you.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.464
ELIZABETH: These are for you.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.769
For the place.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.938
ELIZABETH: And the convertible.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.808
Meet me back here at six?

02:45.566 --> 02:52.206
(people chatting)

03:55.269 --> 03:56.437
(Elizabeth sighs)

04:04.445 --> 04:08.248
(cars honking)

04:08.282 --> 04:11.485
RANDOM DRIVER:
Such a stupid asshole!

04:42.483 --> 04:45.953
... ave and Wallace st
right on the corner...

04:52.793 --> 04:56.464
(nervous crying)

06:37.130 --> 06:41.268
(police sirens)

07:00.454 --> 07:09.763
(*loud nightclub music)

07:20.107 --> 07:21.909
(water running)

07:21.942 --> 07:29.617
(paper towel dispensing)

07:32.853 --> 07:35.589
GIRL: Hey, do you
think you could-

07:35.623 --> 07:45.633
(*nightclub music)

07:45.666 --> 07:51.471
(*nightclub music)

08:08.822 --> 08:19.567
(partygoers laughing)

08:21.234 --> 08:25.405
(loud sniffing)

08:32.412 --> 08:34.181
(sniff)

08:37.049 --> 08:39.219
Yeah make it bigger...

08:39.852 --> 08:41.688
Wooo!!!

08:43.023 --> 08:45.525
(coughing and laughter)

08:46.526 --> 08:48.729
Oh hey, man how's it going?

08:51.765 --> 08:53.233
You work here?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.606
You uh...

08:59.206 --> 09:00.874
You want some?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.218
(loud sniffing)

09:11.251 --> 09:15.355
Fuck man, you scared us
for a minute there buddy.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.225
You came in like
'The Terminator'

09:18.258 --> 09:19.392
Fucking guy...

09:19.426 --> 09:22.095
Look uh...
you gotta try some of this.

09:23.263 --> 09:26.199
They call it Genuine Pink Dove

09:26.233 --> 09:30.203
or some shit like that.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.905
(smacks lips)

09:32.239 --> 09:34.908
Go for it.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.384
ROB: All right 'Terminator',

09:44.417 --> 09:47.755
... I'll see you
on the other side.

09:48.155 --> 09:48.789
(another loud sniff)

09:48.822 --> 09:51.258
Yeah do another one.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.160
There you go.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.300
You're welcome.

10:00.333 --> 10:05.138
Hah! What the fuck.
That is so rude.

10:05.172 --> 10:05.773
PARTIER: Hit it!

10:05.806 --> 10:06.740
One more line.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.475
PARTIER: Hit it boy!

10:08.508 --> 10:10.844
Where's my hundred?

10:11.679 --> 10:13.781
Where's my fucking hundred?

10:13.814 --> 10:20.453
(*loud nightclub music)

10:39.973 --> 10:49.549
(thunder)

11:08.702 --> 11:10.503
(screams in pain)

11:16.910 --> 11:22.349
(grunting and writhing in pain)

11:56.750 --> 12:00.387
(door opening)

12:45.165 --> 12:49.269
(birds chirping)

12:57.110 --> 12:59.346
(thunderclap)

12:59.379 --> 13:05.485
(crows cackling)

13:10.123 --> 13:15.628
(thunder)

13:41.021 --> 13:44.157
(panting)

13:45.658 --> 13:47.995
Excuse me. Do you have the time?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.330
(grunts painfully)

13:54.167 --> 13:57.037
You feeling alright?

14:02.375 --> 14:06.246
Perhaps I'm just taken
by how beautiful you are.

14:06.279 --> 14:09.682
Ahh.

14:10.750 --> 14:14.521
Honestly, it's been a week.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.358
Tell me about it.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.502
I've been coming here a lot...

14:29.536 --> 14:34.607
and between sitting
at my father's side...

14:34.641 --> 14:38.445
He slipped away
while holding my hand.

14:39.279 --> 14:42.916
At least you
got to say goodbye.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.019
Did you lose somebody?

14:46.053 --> 14:50.090
Uhhh... I lost my mother.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.559
I'm sorry.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.427
Hah... Azaria.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.262
What is?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.697
My name sorry, it's Azaria.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.732
Spence.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.933
(laughs)

16:10.137 --> 16:11.671
(doorbell)

16:19.346 --> 16:21.648
Oh my goodness,
you're so sweet.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.984
Hi.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.987
I can take those.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.692
You have such a beautiful smile.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.162
Come on in.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.388
I love the flower you brought.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.889
Lily.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.057
You know,

17:38.091 --> 17:40.893
I didn't think you
were listening...

17:41.594 --> 17:46.866
This house is immaculate.
It's worth a fortune.

17:46.899 --> 17:50.437
Yes it is my father's obsession.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.039
Cheers.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.407
(clink)

19:32.071 --> 19:34.974
(thunder)

19:35.007 --> 19:37.310
(panicked gasping)

19:37.344 --> 19:39.846
(loud thunder)

19:41.714 --> 19:43.683
AZARIA: Hey! Spence!

19:43.716 --> 19:44.651
Hey!

19:44.684 --> 19:45.685
(THUNDERCLAP)

19:45.718 --> 19:48.521
(THUNDERCLAP)
What's going on?!

19:55.728 --> 19:57.029
APRIL: There's
nothing wrong with you.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.898
It was just a panic attack.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.233
A panic attack.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.834
Yeah.

20:01.868 --> 20:02.902
All right then.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.337
Are you sure?
What about his heart?

20:04.371 --> 20:07.874
We did an EKG.
Checked his blood work.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.676
Palpitations can
come with anxiety.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.011
Are you under a lot of stress?

20:12.044 --> 20:15.715
Problems at home? Exams?

20:17.584 --> 20:19.752
His father just...
His father just died.

20:19.786 --> 20:25.925
Ah! Oh, I'm sorry.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.462
(bird cries)

20:38.405 --> 20:41.107
(door opens)

20:41.140 --> 20:42.709
JORY: ARG!

20:42.742 --> 20:43.410
AZARIA: Stop!

20:43.443 --> 20:45.044
Could you just relax!

20:45.077 --> 20:46.413
Relax?! You're out of line,

20:46.446 --> 20:47.614
and you're sleeping until
three in the afternoon!

20:47.647 --> 20:48.915
Will you stop for a second!

20:48.948 --> 20:51.083
Could you stop talking to
me like a fucking child?

20:51.117 --> 20:52.385
Jory, You know he's
coming in a couple days.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.621
Why can't you just help me?!

20:54.654 --> 20:57.123
JORY, PICK UP YOUR SHIT!

21:04.130 --> 21:06.633
Why don't you just get
Hitler's wet dream to help you?

21:10.437 --> 21:12.472
(nervous laughter)

21:13.440 --> 21:15.842
Ah... I'm sorry.

21:16.108 --> 21:20.480
Look at me.
It's okay.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.583
He's not doing well, so...

21:23.616 --> 21:26.986
So it falls on you?

21:27.019 --> 21:30.323
There's no one else.

22:06.393 --> 22:16.403
(taps spoon annoyingly)

22:18.405 --> 22:22.341
So does she give good head?

22:22.842 --> 22:27.046
Azaria forgot to mention what
you were in the nut house for.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.255
You should be more careful.

22:37.089 --> 22:40.727
You never know what
someone's got inside of them.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.396
I couldn't agree more.

23:11.924 --> 23:18.230
SPENCE: This stone...
It's radiant.

23:19.231 --> 23:24.403
I can almost feel it,
vibrating in my fingers.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.941
You feel that too?

23:30.142 --> 23:32.445
Yes.

23:32.479 --> 23:35.081
It was my mother's.

23:36.616 --> 23:39.085
I wear it when I need to.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.957
And why do you need to?

23:47.927 --> 23:51.464
Because I'm scared.

24:02.141 --> 24:05.478
I love you Spence.

24:07.146 --> 24:10.583
I love you too.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.452
(relaxed sigh)

24:22.862 --> 24:25.464
(electronic beeping)

24:33.806 --> 24:35.975
Okay.

24:38.811 --> 24:39.879
(laughter)

24:41.514 --> 24:43.716
Where are my keys?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.824
(laughter)

24:52.825 --> 24:54.493
Come here...

24:55.194 --> 24:57.329
I'll see you after class.

25:14.013 --> 25:19.719
(electronic beeping)

25:19.752 --> 25:20.587
(BANG)

25:21.353 --> 25:23.022
(pin drop)

25:51.217 --> 25:55.722
(low thunder)

26:05.097 --> 26:08.701
Finding what you're looking for?

26:08.735 --> 26:13.372
Azaria asked me to check
and make the safe was locked.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.574
No she didn't.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.958
What do you see in her?

26:35.461 --> 26:38.064
She's malleable,
easy to sway.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.633
I know, I gotta do it to
her all the time too.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.274
There's only one other person,

26:48.307 --> 26:51.010
who's made me
feel this way before.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.615
He went on a vacation,

26:56.649 --> 26:59.418
tropical cruise, with his wife.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.288
Two weeks later, he
arrives home by himself.

27:02.321 --> 27:06.759
Says she jumped.
Says she wanted to die.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.428
No one suspected that
this man did it himself.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.965
That he pushed her overboard.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.635
But somehow I knew it.

27:18.805 --> 27:23.509
That feeling...
I'll never forget it...

27:26.312 --> 27:30.182
JORY: My father is loaded.

27:30.216 --> 27:33.986
Like, fuckin' loaded.

27:36.322 --> 27:41.127
And what does that
have to do with me?

27:41.160 --> 27:43.863
AHHHH!!!!

27:53.672 --> 27:58.878
What's it like?
To not feel a god damn thing?

28:01.013 --> 28:04.383
It's a gift.

28:04.416 --> 28:07.086
God given...

28:07.419 --> 28:09.021
Hmm...

28:11.523 --> 28:13.692
You are a very
troubled young man,

28:13.726 --> 28:15.227
Jory.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.328
And I don't know what the fuck,

28:16.362 --> 28:18.397
you're getting
on about right now.

28:18.430 --> 28:21.734
If something were to happen,
if my father were to die,

28:21.768 --> 28:24.570
our inheritance
would be outstanding.

28:32.044 --> 28:35.247
I could give you
some for your help.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.022
Why are you
looking at me like that?

28:43.055 --> 28:47.259
You want me to help
you kill your father.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.897
He'll be here tomorrow.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.633
Boy, you're not
wasting any time.

28:55.234 --> 28:59.238
I'm talking about
fifty million dollars.

29:00.406 --> 29:03.309
And I'll give you
five hundred grand.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.713
It's gonna cost
you more than that.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.249
Five million?

29:16.088 --> 29:18.757
Ten million.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.932
When it's done, it's done.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.567
You don't mess with her.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.804
Fair enough.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.646
ARG!

29:41.447 --> 29:42.915
You fuck me over,

29:42.949 --> 29:47.753
you will be in the institution
for far longer this time.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.255
Or somewhere worse.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.456
AHHH!!!

29:51.790 --> 29:56.762
From this point forward,
your words mean nothing.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.665
Actions, Jory.

29:59.698 --> 30:02.634
Actions.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.505
(pen clicking)

30:23.990 --> 30:28.160
What happened in here?

30:30.062 --> 30:33.132
AZARIA: You vacuumed it
looks... It looks great.

30:33.165 --> 30:36.635
I believe the phrase
you're searching for is...

30:36.668 --> 30:38.137
Lemon fresh.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.506
I didn't know you knew where
the cleaning supplies were.

30:40.539 --> 30:45.344
I don't, Spence found them.
He's been earning his keep.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.846
AZARIA: Good boys.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.516
Where are you going
to be tomorrow night?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.819
I'm like a dandelion
caught in a breeze.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.655
Anywhere the wind blows.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.656
You should come for dinner.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.757
Okay, no, no.

30:58.790 --> 30:59.825
You don't think
Chuck would approve?

30:59.858 --> 31:01.393
No. I just I...

31:01.427 --> 31:03.162
I like this one. I don't
want to scare him off already.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.698
I'd love to come.
I'll bring the wine?

31:06.732 --> 31:08.734
Oh!!!

31:13.039 --> 31:16.042
You're in it now.

31:26.085 --> 31:30.689
I don't know what
you did... but thank you.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.725
There's no need to
thank me. He's a good kid.

31:33.759 --> 31:38.197
I don't know what
it is but, I get him.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.632
Come here.

31:48.474 --> 31:54.580
(thunder crash)

31:55.914 --> 31:57.083
SPENCE!
Talk to me.

31:57.116 --> 31:57.716
I'm fine.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.285
No you're not.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.220
Spence just look at me.Are you
okay? Spence what's going on?

32:01.253 --> 32:03.722
I'm fine...

32:03.755 --> 32:05.591
I'm fine.

32:11.430 --> 32:15.434
(grunting in pain)

32:50.536 --> 32:53.305
So why do you do this?

32:54.340 --> 32:56.775
I'm a sucker for
temptation I guess.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.811
I have a stark
raving mad sweet tooth.

33:00.546 --> 33:03.515
Put a cookie in
front of a five year old,

33:03.549 --> 33:05.484
what do you think
he's going to do?

33:05.517 --> 33:09.355
I was in the hospital
because I tried to kill someone.

33:11.357 --> 33:15.994
Stabbed him in the
neck with a steak knife.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.465
JORY: All I had to do was twist,

33:19.498 --> 33:22.868
and the lights would
have gone out but...

33:22.901 --> 33:28.006
JORY: But I just,
couldn't finish it.

33:28.040 --> 33:33.745
it was his eyes. I shouldn't
have looked at his eyes.

33:36.515 --> 33:40.552
Is this your way of telling
me you're getting cold feet?

34:11.083 --> 34:13.518
Smallest to biggest.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.554
I know.

34:44.483 --> 34:47.319
(door opens)

35:02.834 --> 35:05.937
Why aren't the lights
on in the driveway?

35:05.971 --> 35:08.474
I must have forgotten.

35:08.507 --> 35:11.410
Must have forgotten.

35:11.443 --> 35:15.281
What is it going to take?

35:15.314 --> 35:17.115
(laughing)

35:20.186 --> 35:21.753
Do you find me funny?

35:21.787 --> 35:25.424
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.758
(mad cackling)

35:26.792 --> 35:29.495
Shall I wipe that
smile off your face?

35:29.528 --> 35:31.297
Wipe away.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.998
SPENCE: Mister Bowman.

35:33.031 --> 35:36.635
It's a pleasure to meet you sir.

35:36.668 --> 35:37.969
Who the hell is this?

35:38.003 --> 35:41.440
SPENCE: Spence Cutler.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.775
I enjoyed your
article in the Chronicle

35:43.809 --> 35:47.012
Marshall Taylor was
a mentor of mine at Georgetown.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.986
Then you have my
deepest sympathies.

35:59.491 --> 36:03.529
Well, shall we eat?

36:18.544 --> 36:21.046
Where's Spence?

36:21.079 --> 36:25.517
He and King Prick are sharing
some scotch in the cigar room.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.818
Well, you're doing a good job

36:26.852 --> 36:33.659
of not letting King
Prick get under your skin.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.362
Hang in there.
He'll be gone soon.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.575
We should go to the
lighthouse this weekend.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.942
You and me.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.947
Maybe Spence too.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.225
...and this
artifact here?

37:07.259 --> 37:09.361
Mmm...

37:09.395 --> 37:13.265
That, my boy,
is a Noh Mask,

37:13.299 --> 37:15.634
from the Medieval
Japanese Theatre.

37:16.134 --> 37:20.806
From a private collection
in Japan, 17th Century.

37:21.773 --> 37:26.878
This, particular treasure has
only been seen by a select few,

37:26.912 --> 37:31.450
and used in performance
on the rarest occasion.

37:31.483 --> 37:36.054
Amazing, how the mask
creates the illusion of emotion

37:36.087 --> 37:39.725
simply by how the
light touches it and the,

37:39.758 --> 37:45.130
calculated way
the actor tilts his head.

37:45.163 --> 37:48.300
The, essence of equanimity.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.142
Ahh...

38:07.853 --> 38:09.621
You know...

38:11.323 --> 38:15.494
If there's one, nugget
of advice that I can offer

38:15.527 --> 38:18.129
on the road
to great success

38:20.031 --> 38:25.437
it's exactly that.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.473
(piano roll)

38:27.506 --> 38:29.475
Equanimity.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.343
(laughs)

38:35.981 --> 38:38.517
It's a way of holding
thoughts with spaciousness

38:38.550 --> 38:41.987
the mind is engaged with the
world but not troubled by it.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.293
(clink)

38:48.326 --> 38:51.530
You've never even stood in the
same room with Marshall Taylor,

38:51.563 --> 38:53.832
let alone studied with him.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.305
And how would you know that?

39:00.338 --> 39:03.308
Because Taylor's
philosophy of equanimity

39:03.341 --> 39:07.413
is something a star
pupil of his would know.

39:08.246 --> 39:10.348
I don't know what to say.

39:12.851 --> 39:17.222
I think it would be in your
best interest to say something.

39:18.724 --> 39:21.359
Well, I have you
right where I want you.

39:21.393 --> 39:24.830
In this room.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.999
In this precise moment.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.769
And what
precisely are you after?

39:35.073 --> 39:37.509
Everything.

39:37.543 --> 39:44.082
SPENCE: your house, your cars,
your art collection,

39:44.115 --> 39:49.721
your furniture,
your daughter, your cash.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.357
Your fucking Noh Mask.

39:52.390 --> 39:56.962
Your life.
Everything. I'm taking it.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.969
Very thorough.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.106
I'm particularly
excited to get my hands

40:08.139 --> 40:10.609
on your dead
wife's necklace.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.646
(laughing)

40:17.282 --> 40:21.319
You parasite.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.222
You've had your sticky fingers

40:24.255 --> 40:26.424
in more than just my daughter.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.929
Daddy's little girl.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.933
You know,

40:34.966 --> 40:37.569
It's one thing to pull
the wool over the eyes

40:37.603 --> 40:40.071
of that naive little bitch,

40:40.105 --> 40:42.574
but I'm curious as to
what makes you think

40:42.608 --> 40:46.745
that I would ever
let you walk out of-

40:46.778 --> 40:50.448
walk...
walk out of her alive.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.784
Are you okay Chuck?

40:54.620 --> 40:56.988
What the hell
is happening to me?

40:57.355 --> 40:58.957
Goddammit!

40:59.457 --> 41:02.160
What have you done?

41:22.047 --> 41:23.348
(shudders)

41:34.159 --> 41:36.227
AZARIA: Spence?
Are you down here?

41:37.162 --> 41:38.463
Spence.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.998
JORY: Spence, Stop!

41:44.536 --> 41:46.738
Think of all the money
you're going to inherit Jory.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.208
No!

41:50.241 --> 41:51.309
No!
Fuck, I knew it!

41:51.342 --> 41:52.310
Give it!
Fuck, I knew it!

41:52.343 --> 41:53.344
Give it!

41:57.015 --> 41:58.550
What the hell
happened you guys?!

41:58.584 --> 42:00.085
Spence stop it!!

42:07.525 --> 42:15.200
(shrill ringing)

42:15.233 --> 42:18.203
(thunder)

42:20.371 --> 42:21.773
(gagging and coughing)

42:22.874 --> 42:28.413
(THUNDERCLAP)

42:34.052 --> 42:37.522
Spence, where are you going?!
Come -

42:37.555 --> 42:40.225
Jory what the heck happened?!

42:50.235 --> 42:56.908
(thunder)

43:17.295 --> 43:18.797
You.

43:19.297 --> 43:22.934
So this is what happens,

43:22.968 --> 43:25.403
when you trust
a certifiable nutcase.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.506
Spence, I'm sorry.
I'm fucking sorry.

43:30.008 --> 43:32.978
(thunder)

43:40.852 --> 43:44.956
(running water)

43:46.324 --> 43:48.626
I should stab
you in the fucking neck!

43:49.795 --> 43:52.964
(loud thunder)

43:52.998 --> 43:54.432
(inner screaming)

43:54.465 --> 43:56.101
(inner screaming)
I got something for you.

43:56.134 --> 44:02.640
(inner screaming)

44:05.543 --> 44:07.979
Do you know how fucked we
would be if I didn't grab this?

44:08.013 --> 44:09.180
It's worth a million dollars.

44:09.214 --> 44:11.449
You wanted it.
You know you did.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.719
Just get the fuck out of here.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.356
I brought this for you
I want you to have it!

44:18.389 --> 44:20.391
(door opening)

44:20.425 --> 44:24.129
(thunder)

44:24.162 --> 44:30.535
(inner screaming)
(heavy breathing)

44:31.069 --> 44:42.881
(strange organic squelching)

44:44.049 --> 44:45.383
(door slams)

44:45.751 --> 44:47.518
(pukes)

44:48.887 --> 44:58.529
(gasping)

44:59.064 --> 45:01.199
JORY: Spence?

45:04.602 --> 45:06.571
(THUD)

45:15.246 --> 45:18.884
Spence! Keys!

45:18.917 --> 45:20.886
(sputtering)

45:27.959 --> 45:30.561
Hi Spence.
I'm Dr. Sidkin.

45:30.595 --> 45:34.365
This is Dr Zimmermann,
our neuropsychologist.

45:34.399 --> 45:36.367
BETTY:We had them give
you some Lorazepam.

45:36.401 --> 45:38.403
Are you feeling calmer?

45:38.436 --> 45:40.371
I guess yeah.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.573
We just had a few
questions for you.

45:43.408 --> 45:48.113
In the past week have you
done any recreational drugs?

45:48.146 --> 45:50.882
More specifically,
Saturday the tenth?

45:50.916 --> 45:56.087
and uh, particularly ecstasy,
at the Uncle Jay's Club?

45:57.588 --> 45:59.557
You got me.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.392
We've had several
patients come in tonight

46:01.426 --> 46:04.062
and the past few days
who have the same symptoms.

46:04.095 --> 46:08.066
They had taken something
called Genuine Pink Doves.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.601
Does this sound familiar?

46:11.336 --> 46:14.772
I seem to remember
something about that.

46:16.641 --> 46:18.276
Alright,

46:18.309 --> 46:22.247
What you're experiencing is
hyperactive cortical activity.

46:22.280 --> 46:27.085
This explains the
heightened emotional state.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.620
You feeling more
emotional than usual?

46:29.654 --> 46:32.157
Happier? Sadder? Angrier?

46:32.190 --> 46:33.591
Maybe.

46:33.624 --> 46:38.129
What about a feeling
of impending doom?

46:38.163 --> 46:40.431
Let's go with that.

46:40.465 --> 46:42.000
BETTY: Can we keep
you overnight, Spence?

46:42.033 --> 46:44.702
You know, whatever voodoo pill
you gave me seemed to work so,

46:45.971 --> 46:49.274
The Lorazepam only has a calming
effect until it wears off.

46:49.307 --> 46:52.110
I'm telling you, I feel fine.

46:52.143 --> 46:56.214
Just a few tests.
It's for your own safety.

46:59.484 --> 47:00.952
Do what you gotta do.

47:00.986 --> 47:02.820
Thank you.

48:15.060 --> 48:15.893
AZARIA: Spence?

48:15.927 --> 48:17.462
SPENCE: Azaria...

48:18.396 --> 48:20.565
Oh god, thank god
you're here. Come here.

48:24.469 --> 48:27.372
What happened to Chuck? Do
they know what happened to him?

48:27.405 --> 48:28.940
They're checking his heart.

48:28.974 --> 48:30.976
What happened to you?

48:32.077 --> 48:33.211
I don't know what
got into your brother,

48:33.244 --> 48:36.214
he just,
he started attacking me.

48:36.247 --> 48:38.549
Has he said anything?
Where is he? Is he here?

48:38.583 --> 48:40.285
He's not with you?

48:40.318 --> 48:41.552
No, I haven't seen him.

48:41.586 --> 48:43.388
Spence, he took your car.

48:43.421 --> 48:44.389
What if he got in
a car accident...

48:44.422 --> 48:45.490
He took my car?!

48:45.523 --> 48:46.891
He took my car?!
Yeah I saw him get in -no,

48:46.924 --> 48:48.226
No, he didn't take my car.
Yeah I saw him get in -no,

48:48.259 --> 48:49.427
No, he didn't take my car.
Spence I saw him get...

48:49.460 --> 48:50.128
Hey hey alright listen listen
I saw him -No!

48:50.161 --> 48:51.229
We an call the police,

48:51.262 --> 48:52.998
give them the plates,
track it down.

48:53.031 --> 48:55.967
No! No, it would get the police
involved, he's gonna go back.

48:56.001 --> 48:56.901
I can't do that.

48:56.934 --> 48:57.268
I can't do that.
Hey...

48:57.302 --> 48:58.269
Hey...

48:59.770 --> 49:01.939
We've got this.

49:04.275 --> 49:07.645
Have you told anyone?
Have you?

49:07.678 --> 49:09.280
No.

49:10.515 --> 49:12.250
What can I get you?
Some water?

49:12.283 --> 49:13.151
Let me get
you something.

49:13.184 --> 49:14.252
Spence... you're half naked.

49:14.285 --> 49:15.253
Let me get you something.

49:15.286 --> 49:17.322
Let me take
care of you.

49:17.355 --> 49:19.657
Don't go please.
I don't want you to go.

49:19.690 --> 49:24.962
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back, alright?

49:24.996 --> 49:26.998
Right back...

50:14.512 --> 50:16.347
SPENCE: What?

50:17.915 --> 50:26.424
(panicked breathing)

50:44.075 --> 50:45.910
Sit down.

50:46.611 --> 50:48.779
Can you grab me
some Lorazepam please?!

50:49.880 --> 50:51.249
Why won't this stop!?

50:51.282 --> 50:53.218
Take a deep breath.

50:55.920 --> 50:56.921
BETTY: Open your mouth.

50:56.954 --> 50:58.189
ARG!!!

50:58.223 --> 51:00.091
BETTY: Open your mouth an lift
up the tongue.

51:00.125 --> 51:03.194
Let it dissolve.

51:03.228 --> 51:05.029
BETTY: Breath,
listen up and breath.

51:05.062 --> 51:07.232
BETTY: Breath...

51:10.135 --> 51:11.736
BETTY: Breath...

51:14.739 --> 51:17.775
I need more of those.
Give me more of those.

51:20.077 --> 51:24.249
I don't care what it takes. I'll
stand on my head for a month.

51:24.282 --> 51:26.050
I'll rip out my
own fucking jugular.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.919
whatever it takes.
Just make this stop.

51:28.953 --> 51:30.921
Look, I can't
just make this stop.

51:33.958 --> 51:36.394
The other patients
who took this Pink Dove

51:36.427 --> 51:38.563
are participating
in a research study I'm doing,

51:38.596 --> 51:39.830
that I think will help you.

51:39.864 --> 51:42.667
I'm not here to be
your human lab rat, FUCK!

51:43.768 --> 51:45.903
This is me trying to get
you through this Spence.

51:45.936 --> 51:47.472
Then give me
more of that shit.

51:47.505 --> 51:48.606
That shit works!

51:48.639 --> 51:50.275
It's not going
to help you.

51:50.308 --> 51:52.243
Okay, as you can see,
it only lasts so long

51:52.277 --> 51:54.078
until it wears off.
Give it enough time and

51:54.111 --> 51:56.647
it'll start losing
its effects altogether.

51:57.282 --> 52:00.818
If you don't find a
way to make me feel finer

52:00.851 --> 52:03.621
than a frog hair
split four ways...

52:06.457 --> 52:07.825
(CRASH)

52:10.495 --> 52:12.930
You're not holding
any cards here, Spence.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.665
You make up your mind quick,

52:14.699 --> 52:18.135
you comply and be
civil, or you walk.

52:25.676 --> 52:28.446
We need to keep you off
the medication for the tests.

52:28.479 --> 52:31.316
To see your reactions
as they happen naturally.

52:31.349 --> 52:34.652
Without
the paradoxical effects.

53:25.270 --> 53:26.871
Where were you?

53:27.372 --> 53:28.673
I've been here.

53:28.706 --> 53:31.876
Don't lie to me Jory.

53:32.410 --> 53:34.779
Stop fucking lying to me!

53:43.721 --> 53:46.391
Oh I am such an idiot!

53:47.892 --> 53:49.260
Don't touch me.

53:52.430 --> 53:54.399
Yeah, don't touch me.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.207
Every FUCKING man in my life.

54:03.240 --> 54:06.277
Every FUCKING
single FUCKING TIME!

54:06.311 --> 54:09.246
WHAT DID I DO?!?

54:13.618 --> 54:15.486
(electronic beeping)

54:30.267 --> 54:31.502
Don't fucking look at me!

54:31.536 --> 54:32.470
Don't fucking look at me!
Don't give me that.

54:38.609 --> 54:39.844
I knew the g-

54:39.877 --> 54:40.745
I knew there was
something wrong with that guy

54:40.778 --> 54:41.979
the moment I fucking met him.

54:42.012 --> 54:44.915
Jory where did you go
when you took his car?

54:44.949 --> 54:46.083
WHERE DID YOU GO?!

54:46.116 --> 54:48.753
WHERE DID YOU GO?!
I WAS GOING AFTER HIM!

54:48.786 --> 54:50.788
I don't believe you...

55:16.046 --> 55:18.148
Is that strawberry?

55:19.149 --> 55:20.985
Excuse me?

55:23.821 --> 55:25.390
Your shampoo.

55:27.157 --> 55:28.493
Um...

56:17.708 --> 56:21.045
It's important that
you lie still, Spence.

56:26.383 --> 56:28.185
BETTY: Spence,

56:28.218 --> 56:32.122
Does antisocial personality
disorder mean anything to you?

56:33.057 --> 56:35.760
No.

56:35.793 --> 56:37.595
Should it?

56:40.130 --> 56:43.200
I would like to conduct
a psycho-diagnostic tool

56:43.233 --> 56:47.237
we use to,
assess psychopathy.

56:47.638 --> 56:50.040
I ask that you don't take
this assessment too personally.

56:50.074 --> 56:52.242
It might not
reveal anything at all.

56:53.478 --> 56:56.146
What makes you think
I'm a psychopath?

57:01.418 --> 57:04.254
BETTY: Did you ever get into
any conflicts in school?

57:04.755 --> 57:07.625
No.

57:07.658 --> 57:14.331
Nothing beyond typical horsing
around. You know. Kids' stuff.

57:15.633 --> 57:17.735
Can you remember any
particular time you may have

57:17.768 --> 57:20.437
intentionally hurt someone?

57:23.340 --> 57:26.811
There is this one time I
dislocated this kids' shoulder.

57:26.844 --> 57:28.445
We were playing soccer,

57:28.479 --> 57:32.282
and he kept cheating,
going out of bounds.

57:32.316 --> 57:33.918
Until finally, I
caught up to him,

57:33.951 --> 57:36.654
and kicked his little
feet out from under him.

57:36.687 --> 57:39.957
He landed so hard
you could hear it pop.

57:40.190 --> 57:46.330
It was embarrassing. But hey.
He had no right to complain.

57:47.297 --> 57:50.167
I taught him a valuable lesson.

57:50.635 --> 57:54.138
I'm sure he never went
out of bounds again.

57:56.674 --> 57:59.977
Just use the push button device
to rate the images you see.

58:00.010 --> 58:01.512
Rate them
from one to five

58:01.546 --> 58:04.314
based on how
upsetting you find them.

58:04.348 --> 58:07.785
BETTY: Have you ever
tried to help somebody?

58:07.818 --> 58:10.154
Very recently actually.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.524
Tell me about that.

58:13.558 --> 58:15.793
I tried to help this
troubled kid kill somebody-

58:15.826 --> 58:17.895
Stop. You don't
want to tell me this.

58:20.831 --> 58:24.134
BETTY: What is it about him
that made you want to help?

58:24.168 --> 58:26.671
I was going to be
well compensated.

58:26.704 --> 58:29.339
And what if you weren't
going to be well compensated?

58:29.373 --> 58:31.909
Do you really think
I'm that fucking stupid?

58:33.010 --> 58:34.378
No.

58:35.746 --> 58:36.847
BETTY: Could you agree that

58:36.881 --> 58:38.849
you're taking
advantage of people?

58:40.517 --> 58:42.887
Why wouldn't I?

58:42.920 --> 58:44.989
SPENCE: I can see in their walk,

58:45.022 --> 58:48.025
if someone's for
the taking, or not...

58:48.058 --> 58:50.227
Even if they don't know it.

58:50.260 --> 58:55.065
They just kinda...
put it out there.

58:55.099 --> 58:58.168
SPENCE: My babysitter, she
tried to give me shit after

58:58.202 --> 59:01.739
she caught me playing
with matches in the closet,

59:01.772 --> 59:04.374
so I let her in
to retrieve them,

59:05.743 --> 59:08.212
and I locked her in.

59:08.879 --> 59:11.215
And I left
her in all night,

59:11.882 --> 59:15.686
until my father
got home the next day.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.922
She had shit her pants.

59:21.391 --> 59:27.564
It was just pathetic, how
she shit her pants like that.

59:38.809 --> 59:44.081
SPENCE: People say that they
feel this, or that...

59:45.916 --> 59:48.418
But in my life...

59:49.920 --> 59:52.489
I basically feel nothing.

59:52.757 --> 59:56.560
(emergency alarm)

59:56.593 --> 59:59.830
(struggled breathing)

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:11.275
(thunder)

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:14.444
(struggled sobbing)

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.281
Spence...

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:21.952
BETTY: What's happening?

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.970
CHUCK: Forget
going to the police.

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:43.173
Do you not see
the world we live in?

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:47.277
We're on our own,
survival of the fittest.

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:51.782
And I'm intent on surviving.

01:00:51.816 --> 01:00:55.152
Meaning what?

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:59.489
Meaning there's no need for
this to get out in the open.

01:00:59.523 --> 01:01:01.726
We'll find him ourselves.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:05.495
And then what? Get
together and play Nintendo?

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:06.997
Shut up.

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:11.368
She gives excellent advice Jory.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:15.472
Magnum PI is talking a
little frontier justice.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.974
Murder on the home front.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:17.875
Wouldn't be the first time,

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:20.711
would it daddy?
Jory shut up!

01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:26.516
You shouldn't even
be here right now.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:34.992
CHUCK: Well, I am son.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:37.494
CHUCK: I don't blame you.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.897
I wanted my father dead too.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:42.032
You know why?

01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:45.502
CHUCK: Because he
was just like you.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:49.339
He was glass.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.843
Wasn't his fault.

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:56.380
He just was.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.618
(crash)

01:02:04.121 --> 01:02:05.890
(smack)

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:11.896
Spence!

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.200
Hi Jory.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.869
I need to talk to you.

01:02:18.903 --> 01:02:20.370
I can't,
I have a session,

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.472
I need to talk to you now.

01:02:27.644 --> 01:02:28.412
Give me a minute.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:29.413
Give me a minute.
No.

01:02:32.817 --> 01:02:34.251
Jory: You're still here?!

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:35.385
Jory: You're still here?!
Actually I'm just on my way out.

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:36.420
I thought you'd already left.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:37.721
Azaria said she
saw you take off.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.589
Yeah well clearly
Azaria was wrong.

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.058
Okay I don't know what
the fuck this is but-

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:42.893
He's just upstairs, he's going
to flip this whole city

01:02:42.927 --> 01:02:44.394
looking for you.

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:45.896
I don't know
what you mean.

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:48.098
We have to finish it.

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:49.566
Finish what?

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.301
You know what!

01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:53.270
I don't.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.239
FUCK YOU!

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:58.275
I must be missing
something right now.

01:02:58.308 --> 01:02:59.409
I'm fucking
sorry alright,

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:00.744
I didn't know
what I was doing.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.080
There's nothing
I can do for you.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.682
I'll get you more money...
I'll get you anything you want.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:10.420
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:11.688
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:12.756
Stop it! Stop!
He's gonna hurt Azaria!

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:13.991
I'm not going to
let that happen!

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:16.293
Stop! Stop it!

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:17.261
Okay...

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.263
I'll get you
anything you want.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.932
That's just the thing...

01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:24.101
I don't want anything.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.669
Not from you.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:31.441
Let me show you out.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.477
AHHH!!!

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.815
You stay away from
me you understand!

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:40.817
Just leave me alone.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:54.164
ARG!!!

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.968
(frantic keyboard tapping)

01:03:58.002 --> 01:03:59.169
(keycard beep)

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:09.179
(frantic breathing)

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:10.981
What are you doing in here?

01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:12.649
Give me what I need.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.152
What is that exactly?

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.720
You know what!

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:19.823
You know I can't-
I can't help you...

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:23.660
You know I've always wondered
what human flesh tasted like?

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:26.330
You suppose it would
taste better off the face,

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:27.831
Please please don't...
or the thigh?

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.833
NO!!!
No! No bitch, no more!

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.368
Get me what I need!

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:39.609
AH!!!

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.718
No... (sobbing)

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:56.893
Look at what
you're doing to me!

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:57.761
Stop it!

01:04:57.794 --> 01:05:02.599
AHH!!!!
Stop it, Stop it!

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.401
God!!!!

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:15.912
(silence)

01:05:34.098 --> 01:05:36.133
And you don't know where he is.

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:37.901
No.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.737
He breaks into lockup,
assaults one of our orderlies,

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.073
and steals medication.

01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:45.242
No Betty. He is not coming back.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:46.977
No Betty. He is not coming back.
He didn't assault her.

01:05:47.011 --> 01:05:50.747
She's not even pressing charges.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.583
Look, look at the
activation changes

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:54.851
in these frontal lobes.

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:56.920
That much change in
just over thirteen hours.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.689
You have never seen
that rate of change before.

01:06:00.824 --> 01:06:02.592
If this drug is all you need,

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.828
to make psychopaths
experience empathy,

01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:06.997
feel fear, pull back
on their impulsivity

01:06:07.031 --> 01:06:08.965
with the supplementation of-
He sure didn't pull back on

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:10.600
his impulsivity today did he?

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:14.338
Think about how much money this
could save the justice system.

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:16.273
He's the only one.
Corrections, come on...

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.774
It's just a single case.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:21.445
Uh, an outlier.
And probably just a fluke.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:24.014
And there's no way
that you are gonna

01:06:24.048 --> 01:06:25.349
get this past
the ethics board.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:26.883
(scoffs)

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:30.287
I am not risking my team,

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.655
just so you can chase an article

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:34.958
in the New England Journal,
or win a Nobel Prize.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:38.962
And don't tell me that
isn't what this is about.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:42.366
This could change everything.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.503
Well there's, nothing I can do.

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:11.528
(grunting and wheezing)

01:07:22.206 --> 01:07:24.374
Why is this happening?

01:07:25.209 --> 01:07:28.178
Your body has never experienced
some of these things before.

01:07:28.212 --> 01:07:33.049
No, I mean why me?

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:35.752
Out of all the other
useless fucking people

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:40.590
on this godforsaken
planet, it had to happen to me.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:50.367
How did I do on your little
test for psychopaths huh?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.535
SPENCE: Did I pass it?

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.036
You scored
thirty six out of forty.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:56.140
So yes, you scored
pretty fucking high.

01:07:58.975 --> 01:08:02.246
They're just feelings Spence.
They're not going to kill you.

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:06.283
You don't fucking get it.
I gotta get outta here.

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.620
I have a proposition.

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:15.125
What's the matter Doctor?

01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:16.725
SPENCE: Is your husband
not doing it for you?

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.129
My husband fucks
me just fine thanks.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:20.596
I'll help you learn
to cope with this shit,

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:23.133
but you have to
work with me here.

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:26.236
Look, if I can prove
that I've discovered

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:27.604
a way to
treat a psychopath,

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:30.774
it will be a tremendous
breakthrough in my field.

01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:35.279
You need treatment Spence.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:36.680
You keep numbing yourself

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:39.983
with medication or alcohol,
it'll just get worse.

01:08:43.019 --> 01:08:47.323
I can get you in after
hours, off the record.

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:49.626
No threats,
no tantrums, no tricks.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:52.095
I feel like you're pulling a
fast one on me, or anybody else,

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:55.299
I'll string you up by
your testicles from a tree.

01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:58.167
I'd like to see that.

01:08:58.202 --> 01:09:01.705
I get my research.
You get your treatment.

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:06.975
It'll stop?

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:11.046
Sure it will.

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:46.350
I thought you were bringing
King Prick here with you?

01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:48.484
No.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:51.520
They're holding
onto him for more tests.

01:09:58.762 --> 01:10:01.197
You're okay?

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:07.671
You are the only one who
gives a shit about me.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.874
You and Mom.

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:14.244
And I fucked this up for you.

01:10:14.278 --> 01:10:15.712
What?

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:21.751
It was my idea.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:24.854
Spence was helping me.

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:26.356
I didn't want you to see,

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:32.262
so I tried to stop it,
and that's when you walked in.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:40.637
I took Spence the necklace
because I still wanted it done.

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:49.446
You gave him mom's necklace?

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:55.084
I know where he is.

01:11:38.495 --> 01:11:42.432
(low moaning)

01:11:42.466 --> 01:11:46.470
(thunder)

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:52.008
(moaning)

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:24.474
(moaning turns to screams)

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:28.878
(loud thunder)

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.939
I knew you'd come around.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.174
Wow, wait. What are you
going to do with that?

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.743
Whatever I fucking need to!

01:12:59.776 --> 01:13:01.244
Why what for? What did I do?

01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:01.945
Why what for? What did I do?
Why didn't you tell me what

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:02.712
Jory was trying to do?!

01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:04.013
I really don't understand-

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:05.214
I really don't understand-
No! You're so fucked!

01:13:05.248 --> 01:13:05.882
And I'm not falling
for your shit again!

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:07.183
(thunder)
Spence!

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.084
FUCK YOU!

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.786
FUCK YOU!
Ahh!!

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:13.723
AZARIA: Where is it?

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:15.024
Get the fuck up.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:16.726
GET THE FUCK UP!

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.372
I'm assuming Jory told
you where to find me.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.708
Yeah, apparently he got
the invite before I did.

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:35.378
He never told me flat
out what he was planning.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:36.713
But you kept it from me!

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.448
SO FUCK YOU YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE KEPT IT FROM ME!

01:13:38.482 --> 01:13:39.949
Stop, Stop it!

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:44.588
You do so much. I didn't
want it to be a burden you.

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:46.790
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MURDER SPENCE!

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:48.558
Sometimes I can be naive.

01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:49.959
I thought that I could
talk him out of it.

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:52.128
Just, stop okay,
just fucking stop!

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.131
Jory told me everything.

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.099
He told you what?!

01:13:56.132 --> 01:13:57.934
He told you what?!
Everything.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.605
Jory stabbed somebody in
the neck with a steak knife.

01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:03.773
Did you forget?

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:14.484
Where's my
mother's necklace?

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.960
Just a-

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:35.138
Oh...

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:37.340
Look, he gave this to me.

01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:38.775
Look, he gave this to me.
(sobbing)

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:41.678
Hey, hey!
(sobbing)

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:45.481
He thought that it would
convince me to help him.

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:49.118
I don't want it.
You have it.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:50.453
I...

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.121
I know how much
that means to you.

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:54.123
Then why didn't you
bring it back to me huh?

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:56.159
What do you think I
was doing in the hospital?

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:57.694
You mean the day you took off?

01:14:57.727 --> 01:14:59.996
I'm sorry.

01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:01.297
I was coming right back,

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.366
and then I started to
have another meltdown,

01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:05.301
and I.. I look I really,

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.971
don't know what the fuck is
happening to me right now!

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.539
And the last thing
you need is another

01:15:09.573 --> 01:15:12.976
poor unfortunate soul
to take care of.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:14.544
I know...

01:15:14.578 --> 01:15:18.715
I know that is was a
mistake to not tell you.

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:21.050
And I'm sorry.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.354
Don't fucking touch me.

01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.857
What do I have to do?

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:31.494
I don't know okay. This is
just insane. This is insane!

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:32.528
STOP!!

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:34.363
STOP IT STOP IT!

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:36.199
STOP IT!!

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:38.001
(THUD)

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:40.203
STOP IT STOP IT STOP!

01:15:40.236 --> 01:15:45.742
No... (sobbing)

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:53.382
(gasping and crying)

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:47.937
(thunder)

01:17:20.536 --> 01:17:21.971
Gah!

01:17:26.509 --> 01:17:31.981
(running water)

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:38.988
(panting and gasping)

01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:20.029
Hey are you okay?

01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:26.369
I just feel wrung out
like a tea towel.

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:28.872
Well have some food.

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:32.776
No. I'm gonna pass.

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:14.750
Spence. I think I have
to go to the police.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:17.586
What for?

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.756
My father, he's
going to do something.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:23.426
Yeah but, what
about your brother?

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:27.263
What about you?
He wants to kill you Spence.

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:31.267
You go to the police,

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.302
your father isn't the one whose
going to be paying for this.

01:19:33.336 --> 01:19:36.439
You gotta think about Jory here.

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:42.411
You know, I keep telling myself
that looking after him isn't a

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:49.118
burden but,
god he makes it so hard!

01:19:52.688 --> 01:20:00.496
He's always been sensitive.
Ever since he was a little kid.

01:20:01.865 --> 01:20:05.168
AZARIA: But it got
really bad after my Mom died.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:21.017
AZARIA: She killed herself.

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.953
Jumped off the
back of a cruise ship

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:26.856
when her and my dad
were on vacation.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.367
Does that hurt?

01:21:12.735 --> 01:21:15.438
SPENCE: Thinking of her?

01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:20.576
All the time.

01:21:21.744 --> 01:21:24.580
Does it ever stop?

01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:29.418
Sometimes.

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:34.457
How do you make it, stop?

01:21:35.424 --> 01:21:38.561
I don't know.

01:21:38.594 --> 01:21:42.531
You let it burn, I guess.

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:46.469
AZARIA: It's gonna burn anyways.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:34.950
(car remote beep)

01:22:52.535 --> 01:22:53.469
VIP entrance?

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:55.638
Get your ass in here, quick.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:04.180
SPENCE: I was seven.
It was Valentine's Day.

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:09.185
My father brought home a
new kitten for my mother.

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:11.287
She named her Sweetness, because
that's what she looked like,

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.821
Sweetness.

01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:18.861
And he got a card,

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:24.467
a big red heart with the word
'love' on it in big letters.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.302
He said that's what
Sweetness' heart looked like,

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:29.505
filled with nothing but love.

01:23:29.538 --> 01:23:36.712
I remember going outside that
day, and thinking about love.

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.847
And what it looked like.

01:23:38.881 --> 01:23:44.687
What it would feel like to hold.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.357
So the next day, my
mother was in the back yard

01:23:48.391 --> 01:23:51.227
planting flowers.

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.864
And I took a knife
from the kitchen,

01:23:55.898 --> 01:23:59.068
and took Sweetness
into the bathroom.

01:24:04.273 --> 01:24:07.042
But no matter how hard I looked,

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:12.548
I couldn't find anything
that looked like love.

01:24:15.284 --> 01:24:19.555
SPENCE: Or even a heart.

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:22.925
Not like on the card.

01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:29.265
What's happening for you?

01:24:29.298 --> 01:24:35.271
How long? How long will
it take for this to stop?

01:24:36.472 --> 01:24:40.042
Look this doesn't
just happen overnight.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.311
When?

01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:47.216
Maybe if there's a chance of you

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:50.553
understanding these
things in yourself,

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:53.456
you would be able to understand
them in someone else.

01:24:53.489 --> 01:24:57.826
Compassion. Empathy. Love.

01:24:59.328 --> 01:25:03.098
I don't feel any
of those things.

01:25:03.132 --> 01:25:05.468
I don't think that's
true anymore Spence.

01:25:05.501 --> 01:25:08.771
That's real nice. But why don't
we just take a minute and look

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:10.306
at what each of us are
getting out of this little

01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:12.608
collaboration. Huh?

01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:16.145
You, a huge amount
of academic kudos,

01:25:16.179 --> 01:25:21.750
and tons and tons of money.
Does that sound about right?

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:26.955
Me, nothing.

01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:43.839
(door opening)

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:21.877
I used to see
that expression.

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:25.047
On other people.

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:28.083
I would steal it.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:35.023
And I would use it.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:56.779
(thunder)

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:45.561
(keys jingle and door opens)

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:48.597
AZARIA: Spence?

01:27:54.437 --> 01:27:58.474
Spence I went back there
we have to do something.

01:27:58.507 --> 01:28:01.009
What is all this?

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:04.813
You have to go.

01:28:04.847 --> 01:28:07.450
What's going on?

01:28:07.483 --> 01:28:14.623
You have no idea,
what I am.

01:28:14.657 --> 01:28:17.926
All of it.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.598
It's all lies.
It's all bullshit.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.633
Spence what is?

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:30.606
Spence, whose Spence?

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:32.274
You're under a lot
of stress right now,

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:34.777
I know what that feels like.
My father...

01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:39.815
is alive and well.

01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:44.286
He is in another city but
he's alive, and well.

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:45.954
Can you just stop, can you just-

01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:51.960
Your father, he was right about
you. Naive, and senseless,

01:28:51.994 --> 01:28:53.629
you made it so easy for me.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:57.065
What the hell are you
doing?! What is this?

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.970
If you don't leave,

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:04.139
I will hurt you.

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:05.307
Why would you do that?

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.176
What kind of sick,
twisted fuck are you?

01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:10.345
You wanna see?

01:29:10.379 --> 01:29:13.682
You wanna see what kind of
sick, twisted fuck I am?!

01:29:16.419 --> 01:29:22.057
If you don't get out of here,
I will fucking kill you.

01:29:37.573 --> 01:29:40.676
Okay Spence.

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:42.911
Okay.

01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:20.816
(birds chirping)

01:31:15.871 --> 01:31:19.975
(thunder)

01:31:25.514 --> 01:31:28.483
(thunder clap)

01:32:05.053 --> 01:32:10.525
(train passing)

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:40.589
(sighs)

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:46.561
(banging on door)

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:06.548
You need to come with me.

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:08.416
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:13.121
I've never seen
him like this before.

01:33:13.155 --> 01:33:14.589
Throwing her
all over the house.

01:33:14.623 --> 01:33:16.291
Wanting to know where
she's been the last few days.

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:18.160
Would you fuck off!

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:21.664
What the fuck is
going on with you?!

01:33:30.673 --> 01:33:33.676
She doesn't deserve this.

01:35:02.898 --> 01:35:04.399
Ha!

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:08.236
CHUCK: Welcome back Spence.

01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:11.106
My son was finally
good for something.

01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:14.409
Where is she?

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:19.581
She's fine. In the next room.

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:30.692
Oh... have some dignity son.

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:32.260
Do you have any
idea how many times

01:35:32.294 --> 01:35:35.230
you're going to have to hit
me with that thing to kill me?

01:35:35.263 --> 01:35:38.767
You'd have to pound through skin
and bone, muscle, tendon.

01:35:38.801 --> 01:35:42.737
Tendons a bitch.
I don't recommend it.

01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:50.312
CHUCK: Well?

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:54.249
Is that not your intention?

01:35:54.649 --> 01:36:02.257
(panicked breathing)

01:36:12.634 --> 01:36:17.772
Calm down, and I'll go get her.

01:36:35.958 --> 01:36:38.961
(loads gun)

01:37:06.821 --> 01:37:09.324
Well, well well...

01:37:10.225 --> 01:37:11.626
Hm...

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:12.694
(WHACK)

01:37:14.696 --> 01:37:16.865
(Azaria sobbing)

01:37:16.899 --> 01:37:21.169
CHUCK: He tried to kill me.
What was I supposed to do?

01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:26.308
AZARIA: Fuck you!
I never saw you grieving!

01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:29.477
I never saw you do
anything when she died!

01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:31.479
You did nothing!
You didn't even care!

01:37:31.513 --> 01:37:32.881
I cried!
I tried to see you-

01:37:32.915 --> 01:37:36.718
And you just did not
give a fucking shit!

01:37:40.722 --> 01:37:42.157
AZARIA: Oh god I hate you so-

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:43.358
AZARIA: Oh god I hate you so-
Oh.

01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:44.859
CHUCK: Oh great!

01:37:45.894 --> 01:37:48.530
CHUCK: Yeah, and here it is.

01:37:48.563 --> 01:37:49.397
Perfect

01:37:49.431 --> 01:37:50.498
Perfect
Jory no. No...

01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:52.234
(disdainful laughter)
Jory no. No...

01:37:56.404 --> 01:38:00.008
Well, the family's
together again, huh?

01:38:00.042 --> 01:38:03.178
You are nothing,
you are NOTHING!

01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:05.680
You treacherous
little piece of shit!

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:06.848
CHUCK: What are you gonna do-

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:09.851
Why don't you do
something with it, huh?!

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:11.686
You can't, can you,
you little pussy!

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.021
Give me the fucking gun!

01:38:13.055 --> 01:38:13.688
Give me the fucking gun!
Don't listen to him! Stop!

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:14.756
Azaria: Jory stop!

01:38:14.789 --> 01:38:15.790
How do you do it?!
Azaria: Jory stop!

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:16.424
Just tell me how
you do it Spence!

01:38:16.458 --> 01:38:19.061
Jory, Jory, Jory!

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:23.098
Look at him.

01:38:25.067 --> 01:38:27.602
You're not like him.

01:38:29.404 --> 01:38:32.407
And you're not like me.

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:36.811
Just put the gun down.

01:38:37.612 --> 01:38:39.647
Put it down.

01:38:44.452 --> 01:38:46.321
(BANG!)

01:38:54.429 --> 01:39:01.636
(Azaria sobbing)

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:28.330
(Spence sobbing)

01:39:28.363 --> 01:39:30.698
I'm sorry.

01:40:55.550 --> 01:41:00.222
(Chuck coughing and sputtering)

01:41:16.638 --> 01:41:22.610
(Chuck laughs)

01:41:22.644 --> 01:41:30.718
Look at you.
You're just like everybody else.

01:41:30.752 --> 01:41:34.422
Hahaha....

01:42:00.182 --> 01:42:06.488
*Timber Timbre-Lonesome Hunter
(Spence breaths with relief)

01:42:06.521 --> 01:42:12.760
*Timber Timbre-Lonesome Hunter

01:42:12.794 --> 01:42:16.764
(thunder)

01:42:16.798 --> 01:42:20.635
(*What did they fail
me and put in you*)

01:42:20.668 --> 01:42:24.772
(*Did those rotten
kids cross a line*)

01:42:24.806 --> 01:42:28.510
(*I'm afraid I'll
never understand, baby*)

01:42:28.543 --> 01:42:32.780
(*And I'm so sorry you
had such a bad time, well*)

01:42:32.814 --> 01:42:36.651
(*I've done some
truly awful things*)

01:42:36.684 --> 01:42:40.622
(*And you must be
very terrified*)

01:42:40.655 --> 01:42:44.626
(*Well you have every
reason to be frightened*)

01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:48.630
(*Since you've been
readin' my mind*)

01:42:48.663 --> 01:42:52.634
(*Who am I to deny this moment)

01:42:52.667 --> 01:42:56.638
(*And who am I to
even question it*)

01:42:56.671 --> 01:43:00.007
(*There is a cross
on a mountain baby*)

01:43:00.041 --> 01:43:04.712
(*There is a cross
flowing over your head*)

01:43:04.746 --> 01:43:10.885
(*Please break this
spell you have me under*)

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:18.660
(*Every heart, is
a lonesome hunter*)

01:43:18.693 --> 01:43:25.667
(*Please break this
spell you have me under*)

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:34.208
(*Oh yes, every heart
is a lonesome hunter*)
