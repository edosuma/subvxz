16:04.080 --> 16:06.200
I will be parked outside
the hotel in five minutes.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.200
If you see anything scary,
just leave, okay?

16:10.800 --> 16:12.760
Don't be brave.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.400
See you soon.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.520
See you soon.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.200
[Voices in Italian]

[Suspenseful music]

17:00.600 --> 17:02.560
Hugo?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.320
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.760
No, no, no, no, no!

17:27.600 --> 17:29.520
[Knock at door]

17:49.800 --> 17:52.280
- Carolyn?
- Hello, Eve. Can I come in?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.520
The room's been cleared out.
All of the recordings.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.720
The Twelve are here.
They must have taken it.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.120
The Twelve?
No. Our team took it.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.920
We didn't see much use
in hanging around.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.720
Best to make a swift exit
when things get complicated.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.120
Shall we sit down?

18:11.400 --> 18:12.600
- Why are you in Rome?
- I'm not.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.600
I'm at home with a bad cold.
Tucked up in bed.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.280
Watching
Homes Under the Hammer.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.640
Where's Hugo?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.800
Why don't you tell me
about Aaron Peel?

18:21.560 --> 18:22.760
He's dead.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.760
How did that happen?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.360
Villanelle used the safe word.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.440
I thought she was in danger,
so I went in and...

18:30.480 --> 18:32.160
- Did you kill him?
- Of course not.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.200
She did.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.240
Alright.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.200
That seems clear-cut. Good.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.440
Good?

18:40.720 --> 18:44.080
Well, it's a bit clumsy,
but it's not a terrible result.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.000
What about the weapon,
the buyers?

18:47.440 --> 18:50.680
Unfortunately Aaron Peel
isn't the first megalomaniac

18:50.960 --> 18:53.480
to think about weaponizing
and selling data.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.440
But now, thanks to you
and Villanelle, he can't.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.720
You wanted him dead.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.920
- You sent us here to kill him.
- On the contrary,

19:06.360 --> 19:10.880
I told you both, repeatedly and
strenuously, not to kill him.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.360
But it's hardly our fault if
an assassin for The Twelve

19:14.600 --> 19:16.680
murdered Aaron Peel.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.600
I think people
will be rather relieved.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.800
Villanelle wasn't
working for The Twelve.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.600
Wasn't she?

19:22.880 --> 19:24.960
Who's really to know
who she was working for.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.200
I do. She was working for us.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.160
I understand.
This is uncomfortable.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.760
This is not uncomfortable.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.680
This is a set-up.

19:34.720 --> 19:35.960
A set-up?

19:37.320 --> 19:38.600
You did exactly what you
wanted. This was all your idea.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.280
Then why does it suddenly
feel like it was yours?

19:41.560 --> 19:44.200
It's my job to get the best
out of people.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.400
Villanelle simply did
what she does best.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.000
And so did you.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.320
You were the person who made
this whole operation possible.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.920
- You mean I was the pawn.
- Don't be twee.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.400
This isn't cops and robbers.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.960
What Peel was selling would
have been catastrophic.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.200
Not just for MI6.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.640
It was never
going to be bloodless.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.440
You'll get over it.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.040
Come on.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.240
No.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.000
She wouldn't do the same
for you.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.960
You don't know that.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.120
You can't be on her side
and ours.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.880
You've got a noose
round you're neck.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.160
I'm offering to take it off.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.920
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.880
Well, then, I'm very sorry.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.320
Good luck, Eve.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.480
When this is over,
I'm going to find Kenny

20:45.760 --> 20:47.520
and tell him
everything you've done.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.560
He already knows.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.840
He's part of
the clean-up operation.

- Hi.
- Hi.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.640
What are you doing here?

21:46.440 --> 21:48.200
Saving your life.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.000
Well, you're doing a great job.
Thank you.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.480

hidden in the dashboard.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.520
Great. I'll go get Eve.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.360
You have to leave Eve behind.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.200
- What?
- You can't go back there.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.640
- It's not safe.
- I'm not leaving her.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.920
Listen.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.160
It's finished.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.720
Get in the car and go.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.880
I'm risking a lot
to save your ass here.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.840
To save me from what?

22:19.400 --> 22:21.240
From them.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.480
From Raymond.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.000
Raymond doesn't know I'm here.
He didn't see me.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.480
[Laughs]

22:28.640 --> 22:30.400
What?

22:30.640 --> 22:32.560
He knows you're here.
Believe me.

22:32.800 --> 22:36.200
If he knows I'm here, then
why didn't he kill me already?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.360
Because someone
asked him not to.

22:41.440 --> 22:45.360
Someone asked him not to
until after you killed Peel.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.440
What do you mean?

22:47.720 --> 22:49.160
They told me not to kill him.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.360
You told me not to kill him.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.760
[Gasps]

23:05.680 --> 23:08.000
It was not my idea.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.360
Wow. [Chuckles]

23:13.240 --> 23:15.200
It never is.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.040
I warned you.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.880
You should have listened.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.200
I thought we were friends.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.920
We are.
But...we are not family.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.800
Is that what Carolyn
is giving you?

23:30.840 --> 23:32.880
Your family?

23:32.920 --> 23:35.040
Yeah.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.280
You choose your family over me?

23:38.480 --> 23:39.960
That's what families are.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.720
It's what they do.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.200
I wouldn't know.
Mine are all dead.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.320
Most of them, sure.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.560
What do you mean, most of them?

23:50.800 --> 23:52.000
- Are you leaving?
- No.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.280
Not without Eve.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.280
What if she went
with Carolyn already?

23:55.560 --> 23:57.480
She wouldn't.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.560
What is it about her?

24:03.920 --> 24:05.840
We are the same.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.960

Yeah.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
[Chuckles]

24:23.280 --> 24:25.200
I will find you
and your family.

been standing there?

God, you're such a drama queen.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.720
I've been thinking about
doing this for a long time.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.920
On the train.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.480
At night with my wife.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.360
Taking my kids to school
in the morning.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.560
I bet your kids are ugly.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.400
They are. They are.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.920
You're not scared, are you?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.200
Well, not yet, anyway.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.400
I don't get scared.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.600
We'll see.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.240
Why did they send you?
The Twelve.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.600
What do you mean?

26:29.800 --> 26:31.920
Well, why would they send
a nobody like you

26:31.960 --> 26:33.760
to speak to Aaron Peel?

26:44.600 --> 26:47.640
Just because I like to slum it
every once in a while

26:47.920 --> 26:50.400
doesn't mean that I'm a nobody.

26:53.320 --> 26:59.000
In fact, some might say,
I'm a real somebody.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.760
Wait.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.720
Where's Eve?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.840
She's probably in
one of these rooms, isn't she?

27:13.200 --> 27:15.520
Let's play a game.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.080
If you can guess
which room she's in,

27:18.360 --> 27:20.280
you can keep her.

is she?

- Doesn't have it in her.
- Let go of her.

You know how long it would
take to kill me with an axe?

- Pull harder.

take you apart for this.

- Do it!
- Let me think.

29:45.960 --> 29:49.360
Don't think, Eve.
He will come after us. Right?

29:50.520 --> 29:52.200
He will kill us.

- Hit him.

- Hit him.
- I have children.

Okay?

out of here?

is going to be perfect.

here anybody would notice?

34:08.640 --> 34:10.840
There is an exit
somewhere here, I think.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.520
Here.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.600
- I can see light.
- Oh.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.200
[Villanelle] Oh. [She laughs]

34:23.400 --> 34:25.320
Yes.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.880
- [Eve grunts]
- [Thuds]

34:44.560 --> 34:46.600
[Eve] Come on! He's so sick!

34:48.400 --> 34:50.360
[Eve panting]

34:53.000 --> 34:54.480
Are you sure you're okay?

34:55.560 --> 34:56.600
Yeah.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.800
[Villanelle] Nice job!

35:10.440 --> 35:12.360
[Eve continues panting]

35:12.600 --> 35:14.560
[Villanelle] You need a hand?

35:22.200 --> 35:24.280
[Villanelle gasps]

35:28.240 --> 35:29.440
[Villanelle laughs]

35:29.720 --> 35:31.480
[Eve] It's beautiful.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.680
[Villanelle]
What do you want for dinner?

35:35.800 --> 35:37.520
- Dinner?
- Mm.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.480
Tonight I could make dinner.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.080
Oh.

35:44.360 --> 35:47.400
- Spaghetti?
- [Laughs] Good idea.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.920
I was thinking,
we should go to Alaska.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.880
Have you seen pictures?

35:55.800 --> 35:57.280
It's so amazing.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.600
We could, uh, get a cabin.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.800
Nobody would bother us there.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.720
We'd be normal.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.200
And I have money. So you
don't need to worry about that.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.520
Okay.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.000
You'll feel better soon.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.400
I'll look after you.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.400
It's going to be amazing.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.920
Come on.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.920
Through here.

36:41.560 --> 36:42.800
Oh.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.760
- [Frantic flapping]
- Oh.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.200
[Shocked laugh]

36:56.200 --> 36:57.520
It's just the birds.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.640
We're fine.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.960
You have a gun?

37:09.640 --> 37:11.160
Yeah.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.360
- Since when?
- It doesn't matter.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.640
- Why didn't you...
- Hm?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.960
Why didn't you shoot Raymond?

37:22.280 --> 37:23.960
You had it under control.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.920
No, I...

37:30.800 --> 37:32.760
You wanted me to do it.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.360
I wanted you to know
how it feels.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.880
How did it feel?

37:48.480 --> 37:50.400
Wet.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.400
[Villanelle laughs]

37:55.560 --> 37:57.480
I'm proud of you.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.040
- Proud?
- Yes!

38:03.320 --> 38:05.240
We're safe now.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.520
You made us safe.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.200
- What do you mean?
- Well...

38:12.480 --> 38:15.320
After today,
people will be angry.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.400
But we can look after ourselves
now, can't we?

38:20.600 --> 38:23.120
I'm going home.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.120
- What?
- I've got to go home.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.600
[Laughs]
Eve, you can't go home.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.680
- Yes, I can.
- We need to talk.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.200
No.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.280
You're ruining the moment.

38:33.560 --> 38:36.200
What do you think
is happening here?

38:44.400 --> 38:46.960
What? I think we'd...

38:47.200 --> 38:48.600
You think we'd be, what...

38:48.840 --> 38:51.560
[Laughs] ..Bonnie and Clyde?
Just go on a killing spree?

38:51.800 --> 38:53.000
- Cut a few throats?
- Stop it.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.400
You want me to be a mess.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.320
You want me to be scared.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.560
But I'm like you now.

39:02.360 --> 39:05.480
I'm not afraid of anything.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.600
- This is what you wanted.
- This is what you wanted!

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
[Whispers]
This is what you wanted.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.840
No, Eve.

39:24.600 --> 39:27.320
Eve, wait.
Why are you being like this?

39:30.480 --> 39:32.520
You love me.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.920
No.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.080
- I love you.
- No.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.280
I do.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.800
You don't understand
what that is.

39:40.840 --> 39:41.920
I do.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.600
You're mine.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.200
- No.
- You are! You're mine!

39:51.400 --> 39:53.360
Eve!

39:59.400 --> 40:01.360
I thought you were special.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.200
I'm sorry to disappoint.
