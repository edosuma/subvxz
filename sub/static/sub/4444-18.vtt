WEBVTT

00:00.490 --> 00:02.098
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.274 --> 00:04.225
We had some girls come into our tent

00:04.260 --> 00:06.193
<i>and we ended up</i>
<i>making out with them.</i>

00:06.245 --> 00:09.295
What is your goal here, Timothy? To turn
the student body against the administration?!

00:09.302 --> 00:11.218
- I've been fired.
- <i> [Mariana] This is our school.</i>

00:11.270 --> 00:13.805
If we don't like something about it,
we have to do something to change it.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.840
My foster parents know I narced on them.

00:15.892 --> 00:18.576
Think they're gonna welcome
me back with open arms?

00:18.611 --> 00:19.994
- Where's your friend?
- She ran away.

00:20.029 --> 00:22.513
Flintwood has one of the best
athletic programs in the country.

00:22.549 --> 00:24.849
- My moms couldn't afford it.
- I'm offering you a scholarship.

00:25.081 --> 00:26.998
<i>[Daphne] They told me I can
get</i> <i>11 years for kidnapping.</i>

00:27.000 --> 00:29.567
<i>- [Callie] I'm not gonna let that happen.</i>
<i>- [Daphne] You don't</i> <i>have control.</i>

00:29.602 --> 00:31.002
Robert does, 'cause
I'm gonna live with him.

00:31.037 --> 00:33.921
I can't even look Stef and
Lina in the face right now.

00:33.957 --> 00:35.640
I swore that I would
never lie to them again.

00:35.675 --> 00:37.808
- Why don't you just tell them?
- Do you wanna go to jail?

00:37.860 --> 00:41.412
Because that's what would happen. I would
be taking you and Brandon down with me.

00:41.431 --> 00:43.681
You can't tell anyone. And
Stef, she's a police officer.

00:43.716 --> 00:46.384
She can't protect you, not
without risking her own career.

00:46.419 --> 00:48.586
I think I should go live with Robert.

00:48.621 --> 00:52.189
<i>[Lena] If this is what</i> <i>you truly
want,</i> <i>we'll stand beside you.</i>

00:56.162 --> 00:58.229
- [Brandon] So how soon?
- Uh...

00:58.264 --> 01:01.265
Well, there's paperwork
to be done, I don't know...

01:01.300 --> 01:03.334
Probably... a few days?

01:03.336 --> 01:05.269
How could you just let her do this?

01:05.304 --> 01:09.206
Sweetheart, we need to respect
and support Callie's decision.

01:09.242 --> 01:11.742
We're still a family.

01:11.778 --> 01:14.145
Families live together.

01:23.906 --> 01:24.905
Hey.

01:26.626 --> 01:28.526
Are you sure about this?

01:28.561 --> 01:30.528
You won't change your mind?

01:30.530 --> 01:32.430
I can't. I told the judge.

01:32.465 --> 01:34.832
It's not, uh...

01:34.834 --> 01:37.368
It's not because of...

01:37.403 --> 01:39.537
No. Brandon, no. It's...

01:40.573 --> 01:42.306
I'm just really tired of fighting.

01:43.676 --> 01:48.345
And, it's not like I'm not
gonna be around a lot, still.

01:48.381 --> 01:51.148
Yeah, I mean I hope so.

01:53.319 --> 01:55.086
Well, good night.

02:03.880 --> 02:04.829
Hey, are you awake?

02:10.836 --> 02:14.605
Well, just in case, I just
want you to know I'm sorry.

02:18.611 --> 02:21.479
- [door slams]
- [cell phone rings]

02:27.670 --> 02:30.438
- Hello? <i>
- [Daphne] Hey, it's me.</i>

02:30.490 --> 02:33.657
- Daphne? Where are you?
- I'm at Girls United.

02:33.693 --> 02:36.377
<i>- Isn't it kinda late?</i>
- Look, I can't talk.

02:36.429 --> 02:38.696
I just wanted you to know, I
told the police about Tasha.

02:38.731 --> 02:40.531
<i>That I took her.</i>

02:40.583 --> 02:43.134
<i>- Daphne... </i> -
And that I did it alone.

02:43.169 --> 02:46.320
<i>- So you and Brandon don't have</i>
<i>to worry.</i> - Why aren't you in juvie?

02:46.355 --> 02:50.040
Rita made it so I could stay at
Girls United, until my hearing.

02:50.042 --> 02:51.976
- Why did you...
- So you don't have to go live with Robert.

02:52.028 --> 02:54.178
It's over. You're safe.

02:54.213 --> 02:56.163
<i>- Look, I gotta
go.</i> - Daphne...

Why aren't you dressed?

03:47.233 --> 03:49.233
I'm not going to school.

03:49.268 --> 03:51.185
- Are you sick?
- No.

03:51.237 --> 03:52.937
Does this have to do with Callie?

03:52.989 --> 03:55.940
No, this doesn't have
anything to do with Callie.

03:55.942 --> 03:58.025
There are other things going
on in my life, you know.

03:58.077 --> 03:59.276
I'm protesting.

03:59.278 --> 04:01.912
In case you've forgot, you fired
my favorite teacher yesterday.

04:01.948 --> 04:04.915
I didn't... You are going to school.

04:04.951 --> 04:07.952
No, I'm not. And it's not just
me. It's the whole sophomore class.

04:07.954 --> 04:10.187
You are the daughter
of the Vice Principal...

04:10.223 --> 04:13.007
And a member of the Student Council.

04:13.042 --> 04:15.860
But because you are my
mother I will tell you,

04:15.895 --> 04:18.928
we're organizing a rally for Monday.
And we're hoping for media coverage.

04:18.964 --> 04:20.130
[inhales sharply]

04:26.889 --> 04:29.807
[sighs] You want something
else for breakfast, love?

04:29.859 --> 04:31.876
Uh, no, thanks. I'm fine.

04:31.911 --> 04:34.245
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
What's her name? Trina?

04:34.280 --> 04:36.280
Taylor. And she's not my girlfriend.

04:36.315 --> 04:39.283
Well, apparently the twins
aren't going to school today.

04:39.318 --> 04:42.152
Oh, yeah, me either. The
juniors are protesting, too.

04:42.205 --> 04:44.205
- Protesting what?
- That mom fired Timothy.

04:44.240 --> 04:48.876
I... Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

04:50.162 --> 04:51.912
What are we gonna do?

04:51.964 --> 04:53.998
I'm not sure what we can do.

04:54.033 --> 04:56.133
- I need your support here.
- And you have it.

04:56.168 --> 04:59.220
But they're a little too big
to carry out the front door.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.138
I could arrest them for truancy...

05:01.173 --> 05:03.841
- This isn't funny.
- Look, it's one day.

05:03.876 --> 05:05.993
And trust me, they're gonna
be so bored by the end of it

05:06.045 --> 05:07.945
they're gonna be dying to
go back to school on Monday.

05:07.980 --> 05:11.599
Bored? With their computers and
their phones and their video...

05:12.868 --> 05:14.718
... games.

05:14.754 --> 05:17.588
But how are we supposed to do our homework?

05:17.623 --> 05:20.557
You have got pencils and paper
and text books, don't you?

05:20.610 --> 05:24.428
I'll be taking your phones as well, please.

05:25.698 --> 05:27.598
I could take you off the
family plan anytime I want.

05:27.633 --> 05:30.734
What? Mom! What if we need
to get in touch with you?

05:30.770 --> 05:32.703
- Use the home phone.
- What if we're not home?

05:32.755 --> 05:37.258
Oh, no. You are staying home
from school, you are staying home.

05:37.310 --> 05:40.411
Um, you do realize this means
we can't record our shows, right?

05:40.446 --> 05:42.579
Not helping. Did you
get the wireless router?

05:42.581 --> 05:46.133
- Yeah, it's right there.
- You're taking the Internet?

05:46.185 --> 05:49.386
- You can't do that!
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is like unconstitutional.

05:49.422 --> 05:51.372
You're obstructing our
attempt to organize, Mama.

05:51.407 --> 05:53.374
You can still call your
comrades on the land-line.

05:53.426 --> 05:55.125
Yeah, like we know anyone's number.

05:55.161 --> 05:58.078
I'm not trying to shut down your
protest, just your entertainment.

05:58.130 --> 06:02.066
- [Mariana] Be careful!
- Just take it easy.

06:02.101 --> 06:05.235
- What?
- We've got our whole lives in there.

06:05.288 --> 06:06.987
[sighs]

06:09.842 --> 06:10.908
Enjoy your day off.

06:12.111 --> 06:14.144
Hey, here. Let me help you with that.

06:14.146 --> 06:16.013
- [Lena sighs]
- OK.

06:17.783 --> 06:18.932
[Daphne] I'm the one that took Tasha.

06:18.968 --> 06:20.050
And I'm the one's that's gotta pay for it.

06:20.086 --> 06:22.853
All you and Brandon did
was help me take her back.

06:22.855 --> 06:24.555
Stef don't have to report that.

06:24.590 --> 06:25.789
I'd still have to tell them everything.

06:25.791 --> 06:28.609
And I'd be getting Brandon in
trouble and he's got the tour...

06:28.644 --> 06:31.745
So you're gonna go live with Robert so
Brandon can play a few gigs in some dive bars?

06:31.781 --> 06:34.465
- Girl, that's just like stupid.
- It doesn't matter.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.518
The judge isn't going to let me
change my mind now, all right?

06:37.570 --> 06:38.736
- It's too late.
- [door opens]

06:38.771 --> 06:41.622
Daph, hey... Callie?

06:41.657 --> 06:45.309
What are you doing here? Come
here, I got a surprise for you.

06:46.479 --> 06:47.478
Come on.

06:51.417 --> 06:55.119
- Look who who's back at Girls United.
- Word.

06:55.154 --> 06:57.221
- [Callie, Daphne scream excitedly]
- [Rita] Yes!

06:57.256 --> 06:59.406
A little love. Little love.

07:04.930 --> 07:08.232
[sighs] More than half the sophomores
and a good two-thirds of the juniors

07:08.267 --> 07:10.167
either called in "sick"
or just didn't show.

07:10.219 --> 07:13.937
They're calling us dictatorial
and monocratic online.

07:13.973 --> 07:15.906
At least they know some big words.

07:15.941 --> 07:18.792
Thanks to Timothy... in part.

07:20.296 --> 07:24.114
Listen, I've also had quite a few calls
from parents and a few board members.

07:26.952 --> 07:30.671
Do you think we made a
mistake firing Timothy?

07:30.706 --> 07:32.806
Well, technically I fired him.

07:32.842 --> 07:34.725
And I certainly understand why.

07:34.760 --> 07:35.943
You had every reason to be upset, but...

07:35.995 --> 07:37.694
You think I was wrong?

07:37.747 --> 07:40.848
I think you asked him to
teach more non-fiction and,

07:40.883 --> 07:43.600
yes, he was being an
ass, but a complying ass.

07:43.602 --> 07:46.854
If this were a business and an
employee was that insubordinate...

07:46.906 --> 07:48.455
This is not a business.

07:48.507 --> 07:50.374
In an academia we encourage debate

07:50.376 --> 07:52.376
and opinions that may differ
from the administration's.

07:52.411 --> 07:55.529
This is Anchor Beach, not Harvard, Lena.

07:55.581 --> 07:58.165
And what this school
needs to get out of debt,

07:58.217 --> 08:00.501
is strong leadership, which it has not had.

08:02.254 --> 08:05.122
We... We can't lead if
the students have control.

08:05.157 --> 08:08.325
So I need you to send an email
letting them and their parents know

08:08.344 --> 08:13.163
if they are absent on Monday without a
legitimate excuse, they'll be suspended.

08:13.199 --> 08:15.416
Suspended? Isn't that a little bit extreme?

08:15.451 --> 08:18.168
It's not open for debate.

08:18.204 --> 08:20.304
Either you send it, or I will.

08:28.848 --> 08:30.914
[Taylor] You'll get used to it.

08:30.950 --> 08:34.784
I just pretend like I'm watching a
super boring documentary about, like,

08:34.820 --> 08:37.888
the mating rituals of meerkats. And
then it's like they're not even here.

08:39.859 --> 08:43.677
Hey! Have any of you
guys been to the fair yet?

08:43.712 --> 08:44.862
It's the last weekend.

08:44.897 --> 08:47.531
I was thinking we could all go tomorrow?

08:47.566 --> 08:50.434
We're going to the pier, but
you guys should totally go.

08:50.469 --> 08:53.420
The fair sounds fun. We
can go to the pier anytime.

08:53.472 --> 08:57.658
- I can't. I have plans with family.
- [Connor] What about Sunday?

08:57.710 --> 08:59.676
Perfect. Then we can still go to the pier.

08:59.712 --> 09:02.546
All weekend. We're going camping.

09:02.598 --> 09:04.648
Didn't you just go camping?

09:04.683 --> 09:07.201
We're going again.

09:07.253 --> 09:08.168
Sorry.

09:10.523 --> 09:13.423
So you gotta go live
with your birth dad? Dang.

09:16.078 --> 09:17.094
What's up with you?

09:17.129 --> 09:19.029
Just glad to be outta juvie.

09:19.064 --> 09:22.065
It's messed up in there. Girl's
busting on each other like dudes.

09:22.101 --> 09:23.300
Is Becka still in, or... ?

09:23.335 --> 09:26.136
Nah, they got her in some
drug rehab last I heard.

09:26.172 --> 09:27.871
But Gabi's back in.

09:27.907 --> 09:29.189
She is?

09:29.241 --> 09:31.008
She said she's seen Kiara.

09:31.043 --> 09:34.178
- Where?
- South East. On El Cajon.

09:34.213 --> 09:36.013
- Damn.
- What?

09:36.015 --> 09:37.714
That ain't a street you wanna be on.

09:37.750 --> 09:38.815
[Callie] Why? What goes on there?

09:40.753 --> 09:42.619
What, am I interrupting something?

09:42.621 --> 09:45.005
Carmen, feet, please.
What're we talking about?

09:45.057 --> 09:46.723
Gabi saw Kiara.

09:46.775 --> 09:49.626
- On El Cajon.
- Working?

09:49.812 --> 09:52.946
What's she doing, selling drugs?

09:52.948 --> 09:54.848
Worse.

10:03.011 --> 10:05.278
Tory...

10:05.280 --> 10:07.080
Tony. Gwynn.

10:07.115 --> 10:09.132
Played right field for the Padres.

10:09.167 --> 10:10.216
I didn't know you were into sports.

10:10.251 --> 10:12.151
I'm not, really.

10:12.187 --> 10:14.153
But my grandfather was.

10:14.189 --> 10:16.189
He gave it to me, before he died, so...

10:16.224 --> 10:17.290
What do you think it's worth?

10:19.160 --> 10:22.061
- I'm not sure.
- Look it up online.

10:22.097 --> 10:25.064
Well, um, my mom sort of, uh...

10:26.034 --> 10:28.801
... took the Internet away.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.737
You know, to make sure
we're not having any fun.

10:30.772 --> 10:33.539
There are other ways to have fun.

10:34.809 --> 10:37.560
And that's probably why you asked me over.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.646
Well, she didn't say we
had to stay home alone.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.883
Seriously. Maybe you could sell
it for enough to go on the tour.

10:43.918 --> 10:47.553
Yeah, well, my other mom
would probably kill me

10:47.589 --> 10:50.623
and I don't know, it kinda feels...

10:50.658 --> 10:53.426
... disrespectful, I
guess, to my grandfather.

10:53.461 --> 10:55.511
It's not like he'll ever know.

10:55.563 --> 10:59.198
Unless you think he's looking
down on you from heaven?

10:59.250 --> 11:01.200
Well, I don't know about heaven,

11:01.236 --> 11:05.104
but I think they can maybe see us.

11:07.358 --> 11:13.146
So, do you think he's watching us now?

11:18.970 --> 11:21.320
I sort of hope not.

11:21.356 --> 11:24.090
And talk about a buzz kill.

11:34.736 --> 11:38.054
We could do this every day. On tour.

11:39.974 --> 11:41.674
Just saying...

11:42.911 --> 11:44.744
Stop talking.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.817
[music continues]

11:54.823 --> 11:58.391
We have to do something.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.260
We're not in the business of
chasing after runaways, OK?

12:01.296 --> 12:04.430
We're not the police. This is not a prison.

12:04.466 --> 12:06.232
If Kiara wants to turn her life around,

12:06.267 --> 12:07.767
she's gonna have to turn herself in.

12:07.769 --> 12:11.304
And if she does, maybe I can convince
the judge to allow her to come back here.

12:11.339 --> 12:14.107
She only ran way because she
was in a messed up foster home

12:14.142 --> 12:15.391
and they were going to send her
back there. She didn't have a choice.

12:15.426 --> 12:18.010
We always have a choice, you know that.

12:18.046 --> 12:22.965
Sometimes the choice sucks, but is she
really in a better place now on the streets,

12:23.017 --> 12:24.317
selling herself? I don't think so.

12:24.352 --> 12:27.320
Maybe if she knew that
there was a new Girls United?

12:28.923 --> 12:31.174
Maybe. Maybe not.

12:31.226 --> 12:34.994
But it is not our job to save Kiara.

12:35.029 --> 12:37.029
Excuse me, ladies.

12:46.007 --> 12:48.074
So, I was thinking, maybe next time...

12:48.126 --> 12:49.959
Mm, you think there's
going to be a next time?

12:49.994 --> 12:52.562
- Well, I kind of hope so.
- [Mariana clears throat loudly]

12:53.681 --> 12:55.848
Not even gonna ask. Bye.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.617
Bye.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.452
OK, bye.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.822
- Call me.
- [Lou scoffs] If you're lucky.

13:02.857 --> 13:06.659
[clears throat] What are you doing?

13:06.694 --> 13:09.362
I'm trying to hack my reader,
so I can get onto Facebook.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.546
[Brandon] Why are you
holding them like that?

13:10.582 --> 13:12.298
So I can pick up Mr. Nesbit's Wi-Fi.

13:13.701 --> 13:15.468
If you were an old man,
what would your password be?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.436
One, two, three, four.

13:17.472 --> 13:19.172
Well, I don't know.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.339
Go next door and ask for it then.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.408
I would if he was home.

13:22.443 --> 13:24.277
Where does a retired man go all day?

13:24.312 --> 13:28.080
I don't know. Maybe there's a
sale on Christmas decorations.

13:28.116 --> 13:29.382
[chuckles]

13:32.253 --> 13:33.986
What's wrong?

13:33.988 --> 13:37.974
I just realized that Callie won't
be with us for Christmas next year.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.894
Well, I mean, she'll still be over a lot.

13:41.930 --> 13:43.963
It's not like she's leaving the country.

13:43.998 --> 13:47.099
Yeah, but it's not the same
as living under the same roof,

13:47.135 --> 13:49.936
seeing each other every day.
That's what makes you a family.

13:49.971 --> 13:53.806
Hey, we'll still be a family, even when
we all go to college in a couple years.

13:54.776 --> 13:56.008
Exactly.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.945
We're all gonna be gone.
This is all we've got.

13:58.947 --> 14:00.546
I just...

14:01.816 --> 14:04.817
[sighs] I'm not ready
for things to change yet.

14:07.522 --> 14:08.454
Yeah.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.646
- Hey, you ready?
- I am.

14:16.698 --> 14:19.332
But it looks like we're
gonna have some company.

14:19.334 --> 14:22.218
Connor's father called and asked
if he could spend the night tonight.

14:22.604 --> 14:24.437
Uh... why?

14:24.489 --> 14:28.407
[laughs] Because he's out of town on
business and his flight got canceled.

14:28.443 --> 14:30.092
Hey, it'll be fun.

14:30.144 --> 14:33.362
We'll order some pizza,
I'll bake some cookies.

14:33.398 --> 14:35.281
- OK?
- Yeah.

14:35.283 --> 14:39.435
OK. Uh, I've got to drop something
off. I'll meet you guys at the car.

14:39.470 --> 14:41.387
OK.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.763
What happened to your family camping trip?

14:59.774 --> 15:01.040
[knocking at door]

15:02.744 --> 15:03.993
- Hey!
- Hey.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.795
Free for dinner?

15:05.847 --> 15:07.880
Uh... yeah.

15:13.521 --> 15:16.589
So what about Idyllwild?
Where are you with that?

15:17.625 --> 15:18.924
Uh...

15:18.960 --> 15:20.693
I guess kind of nowhere.

15:20.728 --> 15:23.763
[scoffs] I don't know. I
really wanna go on tour.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.564
[Mike] Oh, yeah?

15:25.600 --> 15:28.768
Yeah, I don't know. I
wanna have some adventure.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.354
And I'm actually really
into the music we're playing.

15:31.406 --> 15:33.489
Plus you're really into
that girl too, right?

15:33.541 --> 15:35.474
You guys getting serious?

15:35.510 --> 15:38.561
- I, uh... I guess so. Yeah.
- What? What's that smirk?

15:38.613 --> 15:40.279
Nothing, I just...

15:40.315 --> 15:42.248
We had a good day today.

15:42.283 --> 15:44.500
[scoffs] Oh. I see.

15:44.552 --> 15:48.154
What? Don't give me that
patented safe sex speech...

15:48.189 --> 15:51.290
I wasn't going to. All right, maybe I was.

15:51.326 --> 15:55.895
So, what, that's the reason you're
all gung-ho on the tour and all that?

15:55.930 --> 15:58.230
No! No, I swear.

15:58.266 --> 16:03.202
I think it'd be kind of, I
don't know, like, life-changing.

16:03.237 --> 16:07.073
Problem is, I still don't
have the money, but...

16:07.108 --> 16:10.042
Well, your mom's pretty adamant about
you guys staying in motels, so...

16:10.078 --> 16:12.628
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to change her mind on that one.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.930
No, I mean, that wasn't what I was asking.

16:14.966 --> 16:16.882
I was wondering, um...

16:16.918 --> 16:18.901
if you think Mom would freak

16:18.953 --> 16:23.723
if I sold that autographed baseball

16:23.758 --> 16:24.790
that Grandpa gave me.

16:24.826 --> 16:27.693
The Tony Gwynn?

16:27.729 --> 16:29.662
Yeah, I don't know. I looked it up online.

16:29.664 --> 16:33.799
If I sold it, I would basically
be able to cover the whole tour.

16:35.403 --> 16:36.535
But, you know, I don't know.

16:36.571 --> 16:41.357
I don't wanna be disrespectful
to Grandpa's memory either.

16:43.578 --> 16:46.495
That's a tough one, Brandon.

16:47.598 --> 16:49.181
So you think it'd be wrong?

16:50.268 --> 16:53.369
I think it's your baseball.

16:53.404 --> 16:56.422
And it's not like Grandpa gave
it to you with any conditions.

16:56.457 --> 16:58.391
And I'm not into sports, you know.

16:58.426 --> 17:01.994
- And...
- I know!

17:02.029 --> 17:05.964
Don't you think he'd want me to use
it for something I really am into?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.983
You know, something I really want?

17:10.204 --> 17:13.204
That was not an email, that
was an act of oppression.

17:13.207 --> 17:15.207
All we want is the chance to be heard.

17:15.209 --> 17:18.060
And how is it you saw
this act of oppression

17:18.112 --> 17:20.613
with no access to the Internet?

17:20.665 --> 17:23.715
We got online using Mr. Nesbit's Wi-Fi.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.550
You can pick it up in
certain areas of the house.

17:25.603 --> 17:27.153
- Like the front porch.
- [Mariana] Would you shush!

17:27.188 --> 17:29.655
- The front porch is technically part of the house.
- [Lena] Never said it wasn't.

17:29.707 --> 17:32.458
[Stef] And what exactly
did you get online with?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.477
Mariana hacked our readers.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.495
What part of "shush" don't not understand?

17:36.531 --> 17:38.864
- Oh, I did not know you could do that.
- Me either.

17:38.956 --> 17:42.574
- You can if you know how.
- [Stef] I gotta say, it's pretty impressive

17:42.609 --> 17:44.493
Right? You're like a cute Steve Jobs.

17:44.545 --> 17:47.262
[Lena] OK, all right. Can we
please just change the subject?

17:47.314 --> 17:49.648
We have a dinner guest here and
I'm sure he's bored to tears.

17:49.683 --> 17:54.169
I'm not bored. Having dinner with
just me and my dad? That's boring.

17:54.221 --> 17:56.338
Well, that's the nice part
about being in a big family.

17:56.373 --> 17:58.240
Don't know why anyone
would wanna give that up.

17:58.275 --> 17:59.574
- [Stef] Mariana.
- It's fine.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.476
[Stef] Well, Connor, it
is very nice to have you.

18:01.512 --> 18:04.296
It's been a long time since
you've spent the night.

18:04.331 --> 18:06.181
Not long enough.

18:06.233 --> 18:07.349
I got an idea.

18:07.401 --> 18:09.201
Why don't you sleep in
the tent in the backyard?

18:09.236 --> 18:11.119
And you guys can pretend
like you're camping.

18:17.160 --> 18:21.796
So now that Connor's dad
assumes that Jude is straight,

18:21.798 --> 18:23.882
it's suddenly OK for his
son to spend the night?

18:23.934 --> 18:25.217
I didn't know what to say.

18:25.269 --> 18:28.069
He was in a bind and I was on the spot.

18:28.071 --> 18:30.789
It's not that Connor isn't welcome...

18:30.841 --> 18:35.694
I just can't fight another battle today.

18:35.729 --> 18:37.979
- You think Jude's OK with it?
- Nah...

18:37.981 --> 18:40.966
- They have been hanging out a lot more.
- Yeah, in groups.

18:41.001 --> 18:43.885
I think he's just happy to
have his best friend back.

18:46.657 --> 18:48.657
Do you think Jude has a crush on Connor?

18:48.659 --> 18:53.345
Oh, I don't even think Jude's
sure about his sexuality.

18:53.397 --> 18:55.430
He's questioning it, which
I don't think he would do if

18:55.432 --> 18:56.581
- he was straight.
- He was straight?

18:56.617 --> 18:58.366
[Stef exhales] I don't know.

18:58.368 --> 19:00.502
I guess kids are freer to
question things these days.

19:00.537 --> 19:02.470
You know, I just...

19:02.806 --> 19:04.822
When I was 13, I had a
crush on my best friend.

19:04.875 --> 19:08.643
She dressed like Madonna, you know, the
leather jacket, the bracelets... Ooh!

19:08.678 --> 19:14.532
She was the bomb! But, uh, we were
inseparable until she got a boyfriend

19:14.584 --> 19:17.585
and I was utterly heart-broken.

19:17.637 --> 19:19.520
Madonna?

19:19.556 --> 19:21.356
- [emphatic] Mm-hm!
- [Lena laughs]

19:21.391 --> 19:23.625
I was more of a Whitney girl.

19:23.660 --> 19:28.396
So how do you know that Connor
doesn't have a crush on Jude?

19:28.431 --> 19:31.232
Really? Connor doesn't seem gay to me.

19:31.234 --> 19:34.335
[scoffs] Well, no one ever
seems to think I seem gay.

19:34.371 --> 19:35.503
Oh. Unlike me, I guess.

19:35.505 --> 19:38.306
Well, the cop uniform doesn't exactly help.

19:38.358 --> 19:41.976
- Well, I'm afraid I'm going to have to arrest you then.
- For what?

19:42.012 --> 19:44.379
For profiling. And for
perpetuating sexual stereotypes.

19:44.431 --> 19:46.314
Ahh, you're gonna have to cuff me first.

19:46.349 --> 19:48.349
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

19:54.024 --> 19:55.089
What?

19:58.295 --> 20:00.929
You really think this is what Callie wants?

20:03.183 --> 20:05.099
She says it is.

20:05.135 --> 20:08.069
And we're just supposed
to take her at her word?

20:08.104 --> 20:09.904
I don't...

20:09.940 --> 20:12.840
Oh, just I can't believe we're losing her.

20:23.857 --> 20:24.722
[music plays on game, electronic beeping]

20:27.254 --> 20:29.387
Hey, thanks for the pajamas.

20:29.389 --> 20:31.323
Thank Jesus.

20:31.358 --> 20:33.992
I don't think he's very happy I'm here.

20:35.162 --> 20:37.028
He's cool.

20:37.064 --> 20:39.064
Are you still going to the pier tomorrow?

20:39.099 --> 20:41.199
Nah. My dad's not gonna be back until late,

20:41.234 --> 20:43.735
so I'm supposed to just hang
here 'til he picks me up.

20:43.770 --> 20:46.771
- If that's OK?
- Sure.

20:48.108 --> 20:49.941
- What are you playing?
- Star Wars: Commander.

20:49.943 --> 20:51.793
But I can't beat the Krayt Dragon.

20:51.828 --> 20:53.762
You gotta use your
Stormtroopers to lure him out.

20:53.797 --> 20:55.013
Then you just hit it
with your other troops.

20:55.048 --> 20:56.982
Here, can I show you?

21:04.491 --> 21:06.424
[music and beeping continues in game]

21:11.832 --> 21:14.566
See here? This is the
fastest way to level up.

21:14.601 --> 21:16.468
See these no more of these troops,

21:16.503 --> 21:18.670
we have to bring in some
of these guys over here.

21:18.672 --> 21:21.172
And they will distract him.

21:21.224 --> 21:23.358
Yeah, you also gotta send
troops over there, too.

21:23.393 --> 21:26.194
- Nice! Good job!
- Yes! We got it!

21:26.246 --> 21:28.213
- Finally.
- On to the next one.

21:28.265 --> 21:29.297
Yeah.

21:35.122 --> 21:36.254
What's up?

21:39.142 --> 21:44.796
Um, someone saw Kiara on El Cajon.

21:44.831 --> 21:47.065
They said she's, uh,
working as a prostitute.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.768
Oh yeah? Who's they?

21:49.803 --> 21:53.838
A friend of Daphne's. Or
someone she knows, I guess.

21:53.890 --> 21:56.608
Well, that's a pretty rough part of town.

21:56.643 --> 21:59.978
Rita said that there's
nothing that we can do.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.713
You talked to Rita?

22:01.748 --> 22:04.666
- Daphne did, yeah.
- Hmm.

22:04.718 --> 22:07.852
[inhales] Well, I guess I
could talk to some Vice cops,

22:07.888 --> 22:10.622
and ask them to keep an eye out,
but short of her getting arrested...

22:10.657 --> 22:13.425
- Couldn't we go looking for her?
- No. Absolutely not.

22:13.427 --> 22:16.494
You most certainly cannot.
That's a horrible part of town.

22:16.530 --> 22:19.581
It's not just prostitution,
there's a major gang presence,

22:19.633 --> 22:22.350
and Kiara's not...

22:22.386 --> 22:25.520
The girls working there are
not working for themselves.

22:25.572 --> 22:30.542
They have pimps, who have
them brainwashed and on drugs.

22:30.594 --> 22:35.313
And the girl that you would find down
on El Cajon is not the Kiara you know.

22:35.315 --> 22:40.185
So please, promise me that you will
not go down there looking for her.

22:42.155 --> 22:43.988
I won't. I promise.

22:51.898 --> 22:54.699
Still not used to you wearing those.

22:54.751 --> 22:58.853
Forget Steve Jobs, you're
like a cute Clark Kent.

23:02.659 --> 23:04.909
Are you ever gonna speak
to me again, or... ?

23:07.681 --> 23:09.531
Mariana, I'm sorry that you're upset...

23:09.566 --> 23:12.700
- Aren't you upset?
- of course I'm upset. You're like my sister.

23:12.753 --> 23:16.788
[scoffs] I thought I was your
sister. And what about Jude?

23:16.823 --> 23:19.574
OK, Mariana, not
everything is about you, OK?

23:19.609 --> 23:23.695
And your coding and your dance team and
your frickin' abandonment issues, OK?

23:24.815 --> 23:27.615
There are some things I
just can't explain to you.

23:27.651 --> 23:30.702
And I need you to get it,
this isn't easy for me.

23:30.737 --> 23:33.505
And just not make me feel
any worse than I already do.

23:41.214 --> 23:43.047
I'm sorry.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.016
I just...

23:46.052 --> 23:48.002
I'm gonna miss you.

23:51.925 --> 23:53.324
I'm gonna miss you, too.

23:57.030 --> 23:59.030
[cars honking faintly]

23:59.065 --> 24:01.833
[man] Yo, baby.

24:03.253 --> 24:04.769
Hello.

24:04.771 --> 24:06.154
[Rita] Kiara.

24:06.189 --> 24:08.907
Kiara, come on. Let's
go, let's go, let's go.

24:08.959 --> 24:11.743
My car is parked right there. We gotta
get here, honey, but we gotta go now.

24:11.795 --> 24:13.845
- Let's go. Come on.
- Rita...

24:13.880 --> 24:16.931
You got people who care
about you, I care about you.

24:16.983 --> 24:19.984
You know you're better than this. Come on!

24:22.622 --> 24:24.839
- Come on...
- I said I don't do bitches!

24:24.891 --> 24:28.026
- Get outta my face before I cut you!
- We got a problem?

24:29.529 --> 24:31.529
I told her I ain't no dyke!

24:34.501 --> 24:36.851
No, we don't. I thought I knew...

24:36.887 --> 24:38.653
I don't know you, bitch.

24:38.688 --> 24:41.656
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you are sorry.

24:41.708 --> 24:42.740
Get outta here.

24:42.776 --> 24:45.276
OK.

24:45.312 --> 24:48.346
- [indistinct chattering]
- OK.

24:57.770 --> 24:58.836
[Jude] Nice catch.

24:59.342 --> 25:01.308
Go back. Double play. Go again.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.410
Three in a row.

25:03.446 --> 25:04.411
Whoa!

25:04.464 --> 25:07.047
- I'm sorry.
- Very funny.

25:08.384 --> 25:10.384
- Oh, sorry! That was an accident.
- Oh yeah?

25:10.386 --> 25:13.137
No. No! Go away.

25:13.189 --> 25:16.073
- Nope. No, get away.
- [both laughing]

25:20.129 --> 25:22.930
OK, OK. [straining]

25:22.932 --> 25:24.098
OK, I give up!

25:24.133 --> 25:25.950
[both laughing]

25:25.985 --> 25:28.068
[up-tempo pop song plays]

25:32.975 --> 25:34.191
[cell phone rings]

25:37.947 --> 25:39.780
What are you doing?

25:39.832 --> 25:42.883
Sorry, Daria just texted me.

25:42.919 --> 25:44.802
She wants to know if we wanna come over.

25:44.854 --> 25:47.855
- Do you?
- I mean, what else is there to do?

25:50.626 --> 25:52.626
You should go then, if you want to.

25:52.662 --> 25:53.794
No, it's fine, we don't have to.

25:53.830 --> 25:56.597
Whatever, just go.

26:05.424 --> 26:08.726
I decided I don't want to go
to boarding school anymore.

26:08.778 --> 26:11.395
Why?

26:11.447 --> 26:12.613
I'm not ready to leave home.

26:13.749 --> 26:15.716
Uh... OK.

26:15.751 --> 26:19.253
- Are you sure you don't want to hear the guy out?
- No.

26:21.357 --> 26:23.290
Does this have something
to do with your sister?

26:26.429 --> 26:30.397
- Jesus.
- [sighs] I can't leave her, Mom.

26:30.433 --> 26:32.099
She's already freaking out about Callie.

26:32.134 --> 26:35.069
If she finds out you and Mom
aren't adopting Ana's baby,

26:35.121 --> 26:39.073
she'll have a meltdown. It's
like she's losing two sisters.

26:39.108 --> 26:42.359
And then if I go away...
I can't do that to her.

26:42.395 --> 26:46.046
It's not your job to look after Mariana.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.148
Look, Mom, I don't want to go.

26:48.184 --> 26:49.984
Just cancel it, please?

26:52.255 --> 26:55.956
OK. I will talk to Mom.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.066
We've got to stop meeting like this.

27:09.889 --> 27:12.673
Look, I'm sorry.

27:13.676 --> 27:16.010
OK? I...

27:16.045 --> 27:17.695
It's my first month on the job

27:17.747 --> 27:19.947
and I've got students staging a walkout.

27:19.949 --> 27:24.718
I felt less pressure managing
multi-million dollar businesses.

27:24.754 --> 27:28.806
- It's a hard job.
- And that's why I need your help.

27:30.526 --> 27:32.493
[doorbell rings]

27:36.766 --> 27:39.533
Hi, I'm Dan Cruz. I'm
here to meet with Jesus.

27:39.568 --> 27:42.453
Well, no one's here...

27:42.505 --> 27:46.590
... except, a bunch of my guy
friends on the football team.

27:46.626 --> 27:50.277
Well, um, we had an appointment.

27:50.313 --> 27:52.363
You had an appointment? With Jesus?

27:52.415 --> 27:55.482
Yeah, I'm a recruiter
with Flintwood Academy.

27:55.518 --> 27:58.218
We're interested in offering
your brother a scholarship.

27:58.254 --> 28:00.354
An academic scholarship?

28:00.356 --> 28:02.373
Well, no, um... Yes.

28:02.408 --> 28:05.059
We're also recruiting for wrestling.

28:05.094 --> 28:07.428
Oh, um...

28:07.463 --> 28:10.180
Well, maybe they forgot?

28:10.232 --> 28:13.200
Well, you can give them my card.

28:13.235 --> 28:15.035
They can call to reschedule.

28:15.071 --> 28:16.253
OK.

28:17.256 --> 28:18.906
Uh, wait.

28:19.308 --> 28:21.909
Where is this school?

28:21.944 --> 28:23.143
Colorado.

28:24.947 --> 28:26.080
See ya.

28:35.992 --> 28:37.825
Hear the kids out.

28:37.827 --> 28:41.028
Let them have their say, even
if it isn't the final one.

28:41.063 --> 28:44.932
It makes them feel respected
and who doesn't need that?

28:44.934 --> 28:48.535
OK. We'll hear them out.

28:48.571 --> 28:51.588
As long as they show
up for school on Monday.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.507
That sounds fair to me.

28:53.509 --> 28:56.894
Now if I could only get my
own kids to listen to reason.

28:57.947 --> 29:00.564
What happened?

29:00.616 --> 29:03.584
- Well, if you promise not
to tell anyone... - Mm-hm.

29:03.636 --> 29:05.669
When they refused to
go to school yesterday,

29:05.721 --> 29:09.790
I... I may have packed up all their
electronics, including the DVR,

29:09.825 --> 29:12.693
and rolled it out the
front door in a suitcase.

29:12.695 --> 29:14.528
[laughs]

29:17.416 --> 29:20.718
That's gotta be hard being their
mom and their vice principal.

29:20.770 --> 29:24.438
Especially when I'm not
doing a great job at either.

29:27.443 --> 29:30.461
Before you came to Anchor
Beach, right before,

29:30.513 --> 29:34.314
I was, uh, I was five months
pregnant and I lost the baby.

29:34.366 --> 29:37.484
Lena, I'm so sorry.

29:37.486 --> 29:40.421
Yeah, it's been hard, I'm not gonna lie.

29:40.423 --> 29:43.090
Of course.

29:44.427 --> 29:49.113
And now, our twins' birth mom is pregnant,

29:49.165 --> 29:52.382
and she's asked Stef
and me to adopt her baby.

29:52.418 --> 29:54.968
And I feel terrible because

29:55.004 --> 29:57.254
just a few months ago
I wanted one so badly.

29:57.306 --> 29:59.940
So how do I explain to my daughter,

29:59.942 --> 30:02.109
who really wants us to bring
this baby into the family

30:02.161 --> 30:05.129
that... now I don't want to.

30:05.164 --> 30:07.915
It's her half-sister.

30:07.917 --> 30:10.217
I just feel like I'm being really selfish.

30:13.105 --> 30:15.105
I had a miscarriage.

30:15.157 --> 30:19.960
I was only a few months in,
but if somebody had asked me

30:19.962 --> 30:23.831
to adopt a baby just
a little while later...

30:25.234 --> 30:27.117
... I wouldn't have been ready.

30:27.153 --> 30:29.903
You need time to grieve, and...

30:31.006 --> 30:32.673
... it's not your fault.

30:34.059 --> 30:36.727
Thank you.

30:36.779 --> 30:37.978
That helps.

30:37.980 --> 30:40.848
- And I'm sorry about your...
- Oh, thanks.

30:42.751 --> 30:45.586
[exhales deeply] And,
uh, since we're sharing,

30:45.638 --> 30:46.887
I guess you should know...

30:47.890 --> 30:49.723
... Timothy was our donor.

30:56.899 --> 31:00.734
[low-tempo pop song plays]

31:00.769 --> 31:03.737
[Connor] Hey, um, I texted Daria back

31:03.739 --> 31:05.706
and I told her I'm just gonna stay here.

31:05.741 --> 31:09.710
It's not nice to lead people on.

31:09.745 --> 31:13.197
OK, well, I'm not.

31:16.418 --> 31:18.385
- Come on.
- Stop it.

31:19.605 --> 31:21.355
- [groans]
- Are you OK?

31:21.407 --> 31:24.241
I didn't... I didn't mean
to kick you that hard.

31:24.293 --> 31:25.409
Why'd you kick me at all?

31:25.461 --> 31:29.179
You kissed me, remember? In the tent?

31:31.066 --> 31:33.984
And then at the movie
theater, you held my hand.

31:34.036 --> 31:35.869
And now, all day you've been...

31:35.921 --> 31:37.938
I just... I don't get this.

31:37.973 --> 31:40.107
I don't get you.

32:12.538 --> 32:14.337
Hey. Are you OK?

32:15.507 --> 32:17.541
Come with me.

32:17.593 --> 32:20.277
I don't know why you're mad, I'm not going.

32:20.312 --> 32:22.245
I'm mad because you didn't tell me.

32:22.281 --> 32:24.297
I didn't tell you, because I'm not going.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.499
Why not?

32:27.336 --> 32:29.202
Because I'm not ready to leave home.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.271
[sighs]

32:31.323 --> 32:33.240
I looked it up on line.

32:33.242 --> 32:35.342
It's a really good college prep school.

32:35.377 --> 32:40.063
I mean, it's military, but I can see you
getting into the whole G.I. Joe thing.

32:40.098 --> 32:41.414
And there's no girls, which is good.

32:41.450 --> 32:44.317
- [scoffs] Not for me.
- Yes, for you.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.203
Well, wait, do you want me to go?

32:46.255 --> 32:50.857
- No.
- OK, well I'm not.

32:51.994 --> 32:54.060
But I think you should.

32:54.096 --> 32:58.131
- Why?
- Because I see how hard it is for you,

32:58.167 --> 33:03.203
at school and there's so much going on around
here, you know, distractions and stuff, and...

33:03.238 --> 33:06.122
And they want you, which is super cool.

33:06.158 --> 33:07.874
And...

33:07.910 --> 33:09.743
... I want what's best for you,

33:10.762 --> 33:13.697
even if it's hard... for me.

33:16.752 --> 33:18.752
[rock music plays faintly]

33:18.787 --> 33:20.787
[typing on keyboard]

33:26.595 --> 33:28.528
- [computer dings]
- [audience cheering effect]

33:31.600 --> 33:32.883
Yes!

33:42.561 --> 33:45.562
- Just tell her to stay away.
- Why don't you tell her?

33:45.597 --> 33:48.582
I don't need nobody trying to
save me. I got it good right now.

33:48.617 --> 33:50.534
What, selling yourself on the street?

33:50.586 --> 33:52.335
I know what you're doing. How is that good?

33:52.387 --> 33:53.503
I don't need you judging me.

33:53.555 --> 33:55.472
OK, OK! I'm not judging
you. I'm really not.

33:55.507 --> 33:58.325
I'm just... really scared for you.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.126
You don't gotta be.

34:00.162 --> 34:03.463
I finally got a roof over my head
and someone who cares about me.

34:03.498 --> 34:06.983
And there ain't no way in hell
I'm going back in the system!

34:07.019 --> 34:09.402
- We're like a family.
- What are you... A family?

34:09.438 --> 34:12.239
What about Girls United?
Rita's got a new house now.

34:12.241 --> 34:14.291
And Carmen and Daphne are there.

34:14.342 --> 34:17.210
- And Rita said if you turn yourself in...
- They'll take me back to juvie.

34:17.262 --> 34:19.094
Yeah, for a few days.

34:19.130 --> 34:21.864
But Rita's gonna call the judge
and have you placed with her.

34:21.900 --> 34:24.067
OK? That's probably what she was
trying to tell you last night.

34:24.119 --> 34:27.003
You won't ever have to
go to another foster home.

34:27.039 --> 34:28.989
You can live at Girls
United until you're eighteen.

34:29.024 --> 34:30.139
Go to school, get a diploma.

34:31.927 --> 34:33.927
You can become a social
worker, like you wanted,

34:33.929 --> 34:36.862
and work with kids.

34:36.899 --> 34:38.764
And I will see you all the time.

34:40.202 --> 34:44.137
Me and Rita and Daphne, we are your family.

34:47.976 --> 34:51.077
Please, Kiara. I can't do this without you.

34:56.001 --> 34:58.919
I spit in her face.

34:58.954 --> 35:02.555
Do you think she'd still
want me, after that?

35:02.557 --> 35:06.559
Oh, Rita's pretty tough. I
guarantee she's took worse.

35:13.685 --> 35:14.801
OK.

35:16.738 --> 35:18.772
I'll turn myself in.

35:18.824 --> 35:21.541
But, I gotta go to my
place, get some of my stuff.

35:21.576 --> 35:23.410
No, they'll just take it from you in juvie.

35:23.412 --> 35:24.744
- Not if you keep it for me.
- It's just stuff.

35:24.746 --> 35:26.496
No, it ain't.

35:26.548 --> 35:29.482
James bought me some nice clothes
and shoes and a diamond necklace.

35:29.518 --> 35:31.484
You think he's just gonna
let you take it all and leave?

35:31.520 --> 35:34.321
He ain't around during the
day. How you think I'm here now?

35:35.657 --> 35:38.408
You know how it is,
you've been in the system.

35:38.460 --> 35:40.543
I never get to keep nothing.

35:40.595 --> 35:42.345
Every time they moved
me to a new foster house,

35:42.381 --> 35:45.215
they'd take my stuff away, or
they make me leave it behind.

35:45.267 --> 35:47.300
And I ain't doing that again.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.271
Nobody ever bought me nice things.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.427
OK, I'm going with you.

35:57.462 --> 36:00.347
- Callie...
- No, I'm not letting you go there alone.

36:00.399 --> 36:03.066
My shift's almost over. Just wait here, OK?

36:03.118 --> 36:05.168
I mean it. Wait here.

36:06.455 --> 36:08.088
OK?

36:08.457 --> 36:10.173
OK.

36:14.177 --> 36:16.526
Well, I can't believe someone
bought it, B. That's great!

36:17.068 --> 36:20.820
Yeah, so all I have to do
now is ship it to the buyer...

36:22.040 --> 36:25.057
... but then I figured, why
waste the postage, right?

36:26.928 --> 36:28.928
I know your address, Dad.

36:31.816 --> 36:33.766
I thought they shipped through the website.

36:33.768 --> 36:36.002
[stammers] You can't afford this.

36:36.037 --> 36:37.870
Hey, it's an investment, right?

36:37.872 --> 36:40.756
I mean, it's value's just
gonna keep going up and...

36:41.810 --> 36:43.676
... this way it stays in the family.

36:45.647 --> 36:47.947
So you think it was
wrong for me to sell it.

36:47.982 --> 36:51.717
No, I don't think it was wrong.

36:51.753 --> 36:52.835
I just think...

36:52.887 --> 36:54.670
I don't know, Brandon,

36:54.722 --> 36:57.557
I just thought maybe one day
you'll regret it and then,

36:57.609 --> 37:00.827
well, you can buy it back
from me, for more than I paid.

37:00.862 --> 37:04.497
Think of it as a loan, with collateral.

37:05.533 --> 37:06.666
[chuckles]

37:07.802 --> 37:09.602
Thanks, Dad.

37:11.806 --> 37:14.524
You ready?

37:14.559 --> 37:16.726
So we have to take the
southeast bus, right?

37:16.778 --> 37:19.312
- Yeah.
- OK.

37:25.470 --> 37:27.553
I called him.

37:27.555 --> 37:29.639
Sorry.

37:29.691 --> 37:31.524
- No, Kiara...
- Let go of me!

37:31.526 --> 37:34.193
No, I'm not... You're just scared, Kiara...

37:34.195 --> 37:36.445
- You don't wanna mess with him.
- I'm not gonna let you do this!

37:36.497 --> 37:39.549
You wanna get yourself beat the hell up?

37:39.601 --> 37:41.183
Callie, just let me go!

[James starts car engine]

37:58.319 --> 38:01.070
I couldn't let you go
back there. I'm sorry.

38:03.241 --> 38:05.958
Please, don't give up on yourself.

38:07.929 --> 38:09.011
Come on.

38:09.964 --> 38:11.047
Come on.

38:25.179 --> 38:27.213
Come on. Come on.

38:27.215 --> 38:29.098
[song continues]

38:29.330 --> 38:32.064
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen to me, it's OK.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.216
You did the right thing. I'm
proud of you for calling me, love.

38:34.268 --> 38:37.803
- Don't be proud of me.
- OK, what's going on?

38:37.855 --> 38:40.823
You need to talk to me and
you need to talk to me now.

38:42.043 --> 38:43.993
Now.

38:44.045 --> 38:47.246
I did something wrong
and I couldn't tell you.

38:48.966 --> 38:50.249
OK. What? Why?

38:50.251 --> 38:52.001
Because, I was afraid.

38:54.188 --> 38:57.106
Afraid of what? Afraid we were gonna
get mad afraid you'd get in trouble?

38:57.141 --> 38:58.858
Both, I guess. I...

38:58.893 --> 39:00.810
I just thought...

39:00.862 --> 39:04.930
I was afraid because I lied, again.

39:04.966 --> 39:07.032
And because I didn't come to you again.

39:07.084 --> 39:10.002
And because I messed up again.

39:11.973 --> 39:15.925
I thought that maybe that would mean
that you wouldn't want me anymore.

39:15.977 --> 39:18.777
Like you would just finally give up on me.

39:18.813 --> 39:21.814
And is this why you're
going to live with Robert?

39:23.201 --> 39:25.985
I just I thought that if I left on my own,

39:25.987 --> 39:28.821
it wouldn't hurt as much
as if you told me to go,

39:28.823 --> 39:31.073
- but it does! It hurts so much!
- OK, listen...

39:31.125 --> 39:36.011
Hon, look at me! Nothing you can
do is gonna make us not want you.

39:36.047 --> 39:37.096
You hear me? Nothing.

39:38.683 --> 39:40.766
- Nothing, baby.
- OK.

39:40.818 --> 39:42.768
Nothing. Come here.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.954
Come here.

39:57.985 --> 39:59.818
Do you hate me?

40:01.756 --> 40:03.789
I'm glad you told them.

40:03.824 --> 40:05.958
What if they don't let you go?

40:11.766 --> 40:13.916
I would give up the tour

40:13.968 --> 40:17.853
and just about anything else for
you to be a part of this family.

40:20.007 --> 40:22.524
Don't you get that by now? [laughs]

40:23.778 --> 40:25.844
I just...

40:25.880 --> 40:28.781
I wish you'd told them before...

40:28.783 --> 40:30.849
I know.

40:30.885 --> 40:34.820
[inhales, exhales deeply]

40:34.855 --> 40:37.756
It'll be easier going to live with Robert,

40:37.792 --> 40:40.626
knowing I don't have to lie about it.

[continues knocking rapidly]

40:52.640 --> 40:54.473
I know what you did.
Callie told us everything.

40:54.525 --> 40:56.609
And if you ever tell her to
lie to us again, I swear...

40:56.644 --> 40:59.545
Look, I was just doing what I
thought was best for my daughter...

41:00.648 --> 41:01.814
[scoffs] Your daughter?

41:01.866 --> 41:03.916
Yes. My daughter.

41:07.905 --> 41:11.490
[scoffs] It's over.

41:11.542 --> 41:13.792
- All right? The judge has decided.
- We'll see about that.

41:13.828 --> 41:15.828
You're just wasting your
time, Stef. You're too late.
