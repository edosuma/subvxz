 Oh, man.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.914
 NARRATOR:
...it's all about idioms,

00:15.915 --> 00:18.915
 as the team takes on those
 phrases we all take for granted.

00:20.153 --> 00:22.888
 Is it really best
 to hit the ground running?

00:22.889 --> 00:24.523
 [ Laughter ]

00:24.524 --> 00:27.524
 Or to end with a bang?

 I shouldn't be surprised,
 but it smells terrible.

 [ Cat meows ]

01:31.057 --> 01:32.925
 So, we're doing idioms.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.326
 Do you have any?

01:34.327 --> 01:35.594
 I do, actually.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.995
 At Industrial Light & Magic,

01:36.996 --> 01:38.230
 whenever we were working
 on a model

01:38.231 --> 01:41.231
 that required a lot of detail
 and yet was still ugly,

01:41.267 --> 01:44.267
 we referred to the process
 as [bleep] polishing.

01:44.571 --> 01:47.372
 So the myth is,
 you can't polish [bleep]

01:47.373 --> 01:49.641
 -Exactly.
 -That one's been around forever.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.376
 I've heard that
 all over the place.

01:51.377 --> 01:52.644
 I got a wrinkle, though,

01:52.645 --> 01:54.513
 because the network
 has instructed us

01:54.514 --> 01:57.514
 that we're not allowed
 to use the word [bleep]

01:58.384 --> 01:59.518
 Can we say [bleep]

01:59.519 --> 02:01.820
 -Of course not.
 -[Bleep]

02:01.821 --> 02:02.454
 Nope.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.956
 But to set your mind at ease,

02:03.957 --> 02:06.957

 "manure," "guano,"

 "dung," "waste," "scat,"
 "doo-doo," "poo-poo,"

 the culpability

 finding needles in haystacks...

 the toughest task of all.

02:37.690 --> 02:40.690
 So, where are we gonna start
 with this poop polishing?

02:41.761 --> 02:43.695
 Well, I think we're gonna need

 the widest possible array
 of dung that we can find.

 A veritable smorgasbord
 of fecal matter.

 any specific kind we can get

 the best place to find
 a truly broad selection of dung

 to go into the barn

03:09.222 --> 03:10.956

03:10.957 --> 03:12.591
 or as we on "Mythbusters"
 like to call them,

03:12.592 --> 03:15.592
 the large herbivore savanna-
 based feces-production units.

 Okay. Now you've eaten.
 Let's see the other stuff.

03:43.823 --> 03:46.225
 JAMIE: So it turns out that
 giraffes are really efficient

03:46.226 --> 03:49.226
 at extracting the nutrients they
 need out of the food they eat,

03:49.862 --> 03:51.663
 unlike things like elephants

03:51.664 --> 03:54.664
 and other herbivores that live
 in the same environment

03:54.867 --> 03:57.669
 that are basically like cows
 the way they process.

03:57.670 --> 04:00.670
 The giraffes extract
 every last little thing --

04:01.107 --> 04:03.775
 hello -- out of the food.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.776
 And that's why you end up
 with this dense little nugget,

04:07.280 --> 04:09.748
 which tells me that it might be

04:09.749 --> 04:12.749
 better material for us
 to work with.

 chance of busting this myth.

 another might.

 with momentum.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.474
 All right, so what's next?

05:42.475 --> 05:44.876
 Well, we've got another myth
 that will likely result

05:44.877 --> 05:46.778
 -in you getting hurt.
 -Great.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.180
 Awesome.
 What is it?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.815
 You know the phrase
 "hit the ground running"?

05:49.816 --> 05:52.184
 That's the term when
 somebody is already up to speed

05:52.185 --> 05:53.719
 -before they start a job.
 -Right.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.287
 Well, we want to know is,

05:55.288 --> 05:57.589
 if you literally
 hit the ground running,

05:57.590 --> 05:59.157
 do you get going any faster?

05:59.158 --> 06:00.726
 I like it.

06:00.727 --> 06:03.727
 Yeah, sounds dangerous for you.

06:05.465 --> 06:08.133
 NARRATOR: When the phrase
 surfaced in the 1 890s,

06:08.134 --> 06:09.701
 it was meant literally,

06:09.702 --> 06:12.702
 so all the more reason
 to put it to the test.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.739
 We'll move on
 to wheels in motion,

06:15.842 --> 06:18.777
 but kick off with fast feet.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.245
 So, how are we gonna test this?

06:20.246 --> 06:22.180
 I think we need to start out
 with a harness

06:22.181 --> 06:23.782
 to keep us suspended in the air

06:23.783 --> 06:26.518
 so we could get our feet moving
 before we touch the ground.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.587
 We should probably also add
 some forward momentum

06:28.588 --> 06:30.889
 to see if that has any
 difference on the experiment.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.458
 That sounds like we're all
 getting hurt, not just Tory.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.927
 [ Laughs ]
 Welcome to my world.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.928
 NARRATOR: And welcome back
 to Trapeze Arts.

06:39.298 --> 06:41.600
 This where
 our three thrill-seekers

06:41.601 --> 06:44.369
 once tried a 360 on a swing.

06:44.370 --> 06:47.339
 KARI: Oh, my gosh!
 That's enough!

06:47.340 --> 06:49.775
 NARRATOR: The team has
 commissioned an indoor zip line

06:49.776 --> 06:51.576
 to help launch the legend.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.246
 Meantime, they'll need
 some baseline figures

06:54.247 --> 06:57.215
 to see if this phrase has legs.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.785
 I think we should start out
 with a control run

06:59.786 --> 07:02.786
 from a standing start, let's say
 30 feet, and then time it.

07:03.389 --> 07:04.956
 Then we'll use our harness rigs

07:04.957 --> 07:06.825
 so that way we're up
 off the ground.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.027
 We'll start our run,
 and then when we're dropped,

07:09.028 --> 07:12.028
 we'll be in mid-stride and we'll
 see if our time is any shorter.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.333
 NARRATOR:
 30 feet is a short sprint,

07:15.334 --> 07:18.203
 but that's the best way
 to test this idiom.

07:18.204 --> 07:20.172
 It's 30 feet.
 Right there.

07:20.173 --> 07:23.173
 NARRATOR: Any difference between
 a standing and a rolling start

07:23.509 --> 07:26.509
 is likely to be measured
 in fractions of a second.

07:27.079 --> 07:29.047
 Let's go! Let's go!
 Come on!

07:29.048 --> 07:30.615
 Get those shoes on!
 Get those shoes on!

07:30.616 --> 07:31.883
 NARRATOR:
 Tory's the first to run

07:31.884 --> 07:34.884
 his three standing-start
 control sprints.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.555
 KARI:
 On your marks, get set, go.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.492
 NARRATOR: Tory consistently
 clocks just over two seconds.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.263
 2. 11.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.499
 NARRATOR:
 But those tiny differentials

07:47.500 --> 07:50.500
 might make all the difference.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.337
 All right.
 Who's next?

07:52.338 --> 07:55.338
 NARRATOR: Now Kari and Grant
 post their own times.

07:55.608 --> 07:56.441
 I'm ready.

07:56.442 --> 07:59.442
 TORY:
 On your marks, get set, go.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.615
 -That was cute.
 -lt was cute.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.450
 I like the way she hit the back.

08:05.451 --> 08:08.019
 NARRATOR:
 Then Grant steps up to the mark.

08:08.020 --> 08:11.020
 TORY:
 On your marks, get set, go.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.992
 NARRATOR: Grant figures out the
 average time for each runner.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.297
 That's the mark
 they'll have to beat.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.333
 And now for the fun stuff.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.034
 Hit the ground running test.
 Let's go over the plan.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.369
 The trapeze is set up.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.838
 Eric's gonna lift us up so our
 feet aren't touching the ground.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.173
 We're gonna start
 moving our feet.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.174
 As soon as we hear "go,"
 we drop down and start the run.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.645
 NARRATOR:
 Tory takes flight

08:33.645 --> 08:35.847
 as Kari takes fright.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.049
 KARI: Personally, I think
 "hitting the ground running"

08:38.049 --> 08:40.719
 sounds great in your head
 if you're thinking in cartoons.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.888
 But in real life, I have a
 feeling it's gonna trip you up

08:42.889 --> 08:45.423
 and, well, we might see
 some face-plants.

08:45.424 --> 08:48.059
 NARRATOR:
 We live in hope.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.529
 Adam and Jamie have gathered
 the droppings

08:50.530 --> 08:52.030
 from nine different animals

08:52.031 --> 08:55.031
 to see which, if any,
 buffs up the best.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.936
 JAMIE: Those babies
 would hurt coming out.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.937
 NARRATOR: Back at M5, Jamie
 marks up some tinfoil trays

09:01.307 --> 09:03.975
 and finds a novel use
 for earplugs.

09:03.976 --> 09:05.544
 JAMIE:
 They work for your ears.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.480
 Maybe they work
 for your nose, too.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.481
 Okay.
 Here we go.

09:11.951 --> 09:14.185
 NARRATOR:
 Once the poop is partitioned...

09:14.186 --> 09:16.288
 JAMIE:
 Oh, man.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.289
 NARRATOR:
...every sample gets roasted.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.926
 The theory is that dry dung is
 more likely to take a polish.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.532
 ADAM: The whole point
 of baking the scat

09:27.533 --> 09:29.234
 at 300 degrees for six hours

09:29.235 --> 09:31.469
 is not just to bring out
 the flavor,

09:31.470 --> 09:34.105
 but also to get out
 the moisture, to harden it.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.373
 While it's regular poop,

09:35.374 --> 09:38.374
 there's no way we can get a
 polish on it, 'cause it's soft.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.246
 NARRATOR:
 Baked horse manure looks

09:41.247 --> 09:43.481
 way too flaky to take a polish,

09:43.482 --> 09:46.482
 and the same goes for elephant,
 rhino, and grizzly dung.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.322
 ADAM:
 We got five out of nine.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.823
 That's actually pretty good.

09:51.824 --> 09:53.158
 Let's see what we can do.

09:55.027 --> 09:56.595
 [ Laughs ]
 Where do you want to begin?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.396
 NARRATOR:
 Adam's a stuttering mess,

09:58.397 --> 10:00.732
 but this is uncharted territory.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.733
 They'll need good instincts
 and a strong stomach

10:03.869 --> 10:06.869
 to choose the right sample
 and the right method.

10:08.641 --> 10:11.176
 -Jamie picks...
 -Giraffe dung.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.377
 NARRATOR:
...while Adam tries...

10:12.378 --> 10:14.212
 Lion feces.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.281
 And I'm going at it

10:16.282 --> 10:19.282
 with a bit of 320-grit
 wet-dry sandpaper.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.820
 And, honestly, it seems to be
 going swimmingly.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.192
 JAMIE: So, I'm actually getting
 a nice little shine

10:27.193 --> 10:29.194
 on this puppy.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.695
 I'm doing that just by adding

10:30.696 --> 10:32.597
 a little bit of water
 to the table surface

10:32.598 --> 10:35.266
 and rubbing it around
 until it kind of flattens

10:35.267 --> 10:38.267
 what material is already there
 out into a nice surface.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.139
 NARRATOR: Giraffe pellets do
 seem to have polish potential.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.310
 JAMIE:
 The finishing touch on this

10:45.311 --> 10:47.512
 is gonna be to add
 a little bit of oil,

10:47.513 --> 10:49.247
 just like you would put
 on your furniture

10:49.248 --> 10:51.116
 that you've got
 nice and polished,

10:51.117 --> 10:53.351
 and that'll keep it shiny.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.920
 NARRATOR:
 Meantime, Adam goes high-tech

10:55.921 --> 10:58.921
 with a jewelers' wheel.

10:59.191 --> 11:02.191
 ADAM: A terrible failure
 that is right there.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.263
 NARRATOR: Frustration
 turns to exasperation,

11:05.264 --> 11:08.264
 as Adam learns that
 Jamie's using furniture polish.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.300
 You are obstinately ignoring

11:12.171 --> 11:15.171
 the spirit
 and the letter of the myth

11:15.708 --> 11:18.708
 by using a wax-based polish.

11:19.111 --> 11:21.946
 This is about polishing.
 There's polish.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.548
 I don't see the problem.

11:23.549 --> 11:25.717
 You're imparting
 an artificial shine.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.552
 You might as well
 just spray-paint it.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.220
 You're adding material,

11:29.221 --> 11:31.156
 and the material is
 what's getting you your shine,

11:31.157 --> 11:32.791
 not the poop itself.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.792
 NARRATOR: Proving you can
 polish a poop is a big ask,

11:36.162 --> 11:39.130
 so it's no surprise
 that the [bleep] hit the fan.

11:39.131 --> 11:42.131
 It's a wax.
 It helps get a shine on it.

11:46.305 --> 11:49.305
 NARRATOR: Well, I guess we've
 left Tory hanging long enough.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.277
 He, Grant, and Kari
 are testing the literal truth

11:54.513 --> 11:56.815
 of "hit the ground running."

11:56.816 --> 11:58.516
 Just like the control sprints,

11:58.517 --> 12:01.517
 they'll all try this
 running drop test three times.

12:02.021 --> 12:04.355

 KARI: Go.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.663
 TORY: The way I was picturing it
 is really cool.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.664
 I probably looked really cool
 in the high-speed on this one.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.536
 KARI:
 Hanging, set...

12:18.537 --> 12:21.406
 I haven't reached
 maximum velocity yet!

12:21.407 --> 12:24.175
 KARI:... go.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.910
 -Go.
 -GRANT: [ Laughs ]

12:25.911 --> 12:27.879
 I have to say,
 that was pretty awkward,

12:27.880 --> 12:30.880
 and it wasn't really like
 hitting the ground running

12:31.717 --> 12:34.717
 so much as it was
 hitting the ground stumbling.

12:36.088 --> 12:39.088
 Wow. That is the most graceful
 thing I've ever seen in my life.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.259
 Eye of the tiger, Grant.
 Eye of the tiger.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.260
 More like eye of the kitten.

12:45.531 --> 12:48.433
 NARRATOR: You can't help notice
 that hitting the ground running

12:48.434 --> 12:51.434
 looks a lot clumsier
 and a whole lot slower

12:51.871 --> 12:53.738
 than a standing start.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.907
 I'm under no illusion
 that was probably a slower run.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.742
 I almost didn't see her pass.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.878
 KARI: Mostly from
 all the awkward flailing around

12:59.879 --> 13:01.646
 that left me
 in a strange position

13:01.647 --> 13:03.414
 by the time
 I hit the ground to run.

13:03.415 --> 13:04.616
 TORY: Go.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.585
 NARRATOR:
 But the stopwatch never lies.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.088
 On average, the three of us

13:10.089 --> 13:12.223
 were faster
 hitting the ground running...

13:12.224 --> 13:13.892
 There's no way.

13:13.893 --> 13:16.194
...by an eighth of a second.

13:16.195 --> 13:17.662
 Now we're going to do a test --

13:17.663 --> 13:19.964
 hit the ground running,
 but with forward momentum.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.567
 I think this is gonna be
 a much better test.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.569
 NARRATOR:
 Sliding in on a zip line,

13:24.570 --> 13:27.105
 they'll hit the start line
 at speed.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.606
 By any standards,

13:28.607 --> 13:31.607
 this must be the ultimate way
 to hit the ground running.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.813
 But will it be faster?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.382
 TORY: It's hard because if your
 foot is not in the right place

13:37.383 --> 13:38.850
 when you get off that trolley,

13:38.851 --> 13:40.385
 you're gonna
 go straight on your face.

13:40.386 --> 13:41.920
 KARI: Maybe that's why
 "hit the ground running"

13:41.921 --> 13:43.755
 isn't actually a good saying.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.756
 NARRATOR: So Kari follows
 in his floundering footsteps.

 Run, run, run, run, run!

13:49.795 --> 13:51.196

 -Yeah.
 -Yeah.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.381
 Aah!

14:10.382 --> 14:13.382
 When your legs go in the air,
 the trolley starts rocking.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.553
 Suddenly you can't tell
 where the floor is,

14:15.554 --> 14:18.554
 and I hit the floor
 and things just went all wrong.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.360
 I just don't think
 that there's any way

14:22.361 --> 14:25.263
 that this idiom works
 whatsoever.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.497
 I just don't think

14:26.498 --> 14:29.033
 you're ever gonna get
 a significantly better time

14:29.034 --> 14:30.268
 by running ahead of time.

 It think it's just crazy and
 we should just stop saying it.

 But Kari and Tory

14:35.574 --> 14:38.574
 finally did seem to hit
 that mark at high speed.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.612
 Still, it all comes down to
 those fractions of a second.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.617
 Running in the air
 with the forward-momentum test

14:45.618 --> 14:48.618
 is a quarter-second slower
 than planting and running.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.689
 Really?!
 That's a surprise.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.391
 NARRATOR:
 So the jury's locked

14:53.392 --> 14:56.227
 on the literal truth
 of this popular phrase.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.228
 Surprisingly, falling was faster
 and swinging was slower.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.700
 So what say we replace legs
 with wheels?

 but I can't figure out
 what it is.

15:18.717 --> 15:19.584
 It's an idiom.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.585
 We've been exploiting it since
 the very beginning of the show.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.089

 I can't figure out what --
 You got to tell me.

 "Better to end with a bang."

15:31.063 --> 15:34.063
 So you're suggesting that we end
 the idiom special with a bang?

15:36.235 --> 15:37.902
 -Exactly.
 -That's brilliant!

15:37.903 --> 15:40.338
 Let's get out of here.

15:40.339 --> 15:42.240
 NARRATOR:
 Sure, we always assume

15:42.241 --> 15:45.241
 it's better to end with a bang,
 especially on "Mythbusters."

15:50.516 --> 15:53.516
 Today we'll put
 the predictable big bang

15:53.886 --> 15:56.654
 up against
 a spectacular slow burn.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.356
 But first, well,

15:58.357 --> 16:01.357
 we'll have to blow something
 into tiny, tiny pieces.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.627
 So, "ending with a bang" --
 what are we gonna blow up?

16:05.497 --> 16:08.266
 Normally, we blow up
 really big, spectacular stuff.

16:08.267 --> 16:11.267
 I was thinking, what if we blow
 up something small and piddling,

16:12.004 --> 16:15.004
 but in a spectacular way --
 like your little mo-ped there?

16:15.541 --> 16:17.442

16:42.501 --> 16:44.569
 It might look like

 but the core
 of this flexible tubing

 which we have wrapped carefully
 with aged Primacord

 Well, I'm not one
 to let well enough alone,

 is to go out with a bang,

17:23.142 --> 17:24.308
 This is a technique we learned

17:24.309 --> 17:26.210
 when we were doing
 the Hollywood explosion.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.377

 to be my own action hero,

 That way, we get an average time
 from our standing start.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.208
 NARRATOR:
 These first sprints

20:10.209 --> 20:13.209
 wouldn't scare
 a retired mailman.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.814
 Excellent.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.516
 NARRATOR:
 But for the sake of consistency,

20:18.517 --> 20:21.517
 Tory needs to wear a safety suit
 for each and every test.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.126
 TORY: It's just riding a bike.
 How dangerous could that be?

20:29.127 --> 20:31.862
 Yeah, but this is not
 the dangerous one.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.197
 But when you're suspended
 in the air,

20:33.198 --> 20:36.198
 pedaling as fast as you can,
 then it gets dangerous.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.836
 Ready, set, go.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.371
 NARRATOR:
 As with the running tests,

20:40.372 --> 20:43.372
 they average the times
 from three standing starts.

20:43.508 --> 20:46.244

20:46.245 --> 20:48.846
 -What was my time?
 -6.68.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.081
 KARI: Go!

20:50.082 --> 20:53.082
 NARRATOR: And the Tour de Tory
 passes without incident.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.386
 6.34!

20:55.387 --> 20:57.588
 I got it!
 I got a better time!

20:57.589 --> 20:59.156
 NARRATOR: But we all know
 that once you learn

20:59.157 --> 21:01.959
 how to fall off a bike,
 you never forget.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.261
 Oh!

21:03.262 --> 21:06.262
 Now we're gonna move on
 to our suspended test.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.832
 Tory's gonna be on the bike
 suspended above the ground.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.769
 He's gonna pedal
 as fast as he can,

21:11.770 --> 21:14.770
 and then we're gonna release him
 and see if he's any faster.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.975
 My prediction for
 the next test -- three words --

21:17.976 --> 21:20.811
 crash and burn.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.246
 All right.
 I'm ready.

21:22.247 --> 21:23.681
 NARRATOR:
 But is he?

21:23.682 --> 21:26.682
 If history is any guide, Grant
 should have 911 on speed dial.

 [ Grunts ]

21:49.541 --> 21:50.875
 NARRATOR:
 Try as he might,

21:50.876 --> 21:53.876
 Tory just can't, well,
 hit the ground running.

21:54.713 --> 21:57.481
 Once he hits the ground,
 there's so much friction,

21:57.482 --> 22:00.482
 there's so much weight there,
 that it just immediately stops

22:00.485 --> 22:03.485
 and he is basically
 at a standstill.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.523
 All right!

22:05.524 --> 22:07.892
 Dude, hitting the ground running
 sucks!

 Go!

22:10.629 --> 22:11.896

22:11.897 --> 22:14.098
 This was just like
 when we were at Trapeze Arts

22:14.099 --> 22:15.766
 and we were trying to catch
 with our feet.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.767
 It's really hard to,
 well, hit the ground running.

22:19.571 --> 22:22.571

22:23.108 --> 22:24.775
 Just to remind everyone,

22:24.776 --> 22:27.776
 Tory's control run
 was just under 6.5 seconds.

22:28.714 --> 22:30.114
 NARRATOR:
 Clearly, the friction

22:30.115 --> 22:32.516
 between the road
 and the falling rear tire

22:32.517 --> 22:35.517
 stopped the wheel dead
 and unbalanced the bike.

22:35.821 --> 22:38.821
 So, far from proving advantage,
 this test is going backwards.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.326
 GRANT: Your average
 hitting the ground running

22:42.327 --> 22:44.261
 was 9.27 seconds --

22:44.262 --> 22:47.262
 2.8 seconds longer
 than the control.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.700
 [ Laughs ]
 That's not good.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.236
 It's not looking good for "hit
 the ground running" on a bike.

22:52.237 --> 22:54.705
 But we can't stop there.
 We still have a car.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.706
 -Yeah! Let's ramp it up!
 -All right.

22:59.077 --> 23:01.445
 NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie
 are testing the truth

23:01.446 --> 23:02.980
 of that delightful idiom

23:02.981 --> 23:05.981
 "You can't polish a..."
 you know what.

23:06.084 --> 23:07.985
 Adding to the unpleasantness,

23:07.986 --> 23:10.986
 Jamie's use of furniture polish
 provoked a scat spat.

23:12.223 --> 23:15.223
 I mean, it's ridiculous.
 I just don't believe it.

23:15.927 --> 23:18.829
 I'm interested as to whether or
 not these things are polishable,

23:18.830 --> 23:21.298
 not as to whether or not
 I can add something to them

23:21.299 --> 23:23.500
 to achieve a shine.

 a light than curse the darkness.

23:27.038 --> 23:28.038
 Hello, sir.

23:28.039 --> 23:29.840
 NARRATOR:
 Adam's enlisted Jason Arnold

 of dorodango,

23:33.411 --> 23:36.411
 shaping shiny balls
 from common dirt

23:36.748 --> 23:39.748
 using only your hands,
 tap water, and patience.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.453
 ARNOLD: This was made
 out of just some soil

23:43.454 --> 23:45.222
 found in my dad's backyard.

23:45.223 --> 23:47.224
 Then I wanted something nicer,

23:47.225 --> 23:49.092
 so I went and got
 just a nice dirt mix

23:49.093 --> 23:50.627
 that didn't have
 a bunch of junk in it.

23:50.628 --> 23:52.496

 Wow! These are great.

23:52.497 --> 23:54.398
 Can you teach me how to do this?

23:54.399 --> 23:55.332
 Absolutely. Yes.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.800
 I love to teach people
 how to do this.

23:56.801 --> 23:58.068
 -Let's do it.
 -All right.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.871
 NARRATOR: The boys
 dish the dirt side by side.

24:00.872 --> 24:03.440
 It's a proof-of-concept
 cooking lesson

24:03.441 --> 24:06.441
 that hopefully works
 just as well with manure.

 pretty good there.

 I think you could start
 to pick that up

24:15.386 --> 24:18.386
 -and get your hands dirty.
 -All right.

24:18.723 --> 24:21.391
 NARRATOR: They need
 a good balance of dirt and water

24:21.392 --> 24:23.961
 to shape a sphere
 the size of a pool ball.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.962
 And remember, this is
 nothing more than a ball of mud.

24:28.299 --> 24:31.299
 ADAM: I feel like I want to add
 just a little tiny bit of water.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.837
 You really want to try
 and get water out of it.

24:33.838 --> 24:35.372
 Okay.

24:35.373 --> 24:38.275
 If you feel that it's too dry,
 maybe, and it's crumbling,

24:38.276 --> 24:39.810
 then yeah, you may want to add
 some water to it.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.145
 ADAM: No. I feel like
 I'm right on the edge.

24:42.146 --> 24:45.082
 NARRATOR: Adam soon adapts
 to the rolling rhythm...

24:45.083 --> 24:47.918
 This is so much fun.

24:47.919 --> 24:50.320
 NARRATOR:... and the frequent
 trips to the fridge

24:50.321 --> 24:52.556
 to speed up the condensation.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.158
 So, 25 minutes.
 We can pull them out?

24:55.159 --> 24:56.293
 Sounds great.

24:56.294 --> 24:59.294
 NARRATOR: It all takes time,
 but it could be worse.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.465
 If you're doing this
 the old-fashioned way

25:01.466 --> 25:03.100
 with no refrigerator, outside,

25:03.101 --> 25:04.868
 it'll take more like
 a week or longer,

 we hope they both agree on.

 Look at that.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.512
 That is dirt, water, and...
 just a little elbow grease.

25:20.218 --> 25:21.385
 Does it bounce?

25:21.386 --> 25:22.219
 No.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.588
 I think it's actually
 pretty darn delicate,

25:24.589 --> 25:26.857
 but I think this is our process.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.392
 That's beautiful.

25:28.393 --> 25:31.393
 I think we just need to choose
 the most dirt-like of the scat

 -and start with that.
 -Okay.

25:41.939 --> 25:44.939
 I need to take this
 and make a shiny mud ball of it.

25:46.077 --> 25:49.077
 Now, this is lion poop,
 and the reason I want to use it

25:51.149 --> 25:54.149
 is because these guys are
 almost exclusively carnivores,

25:56.254 --> 25:59.254
 and their poop is gonna be --

26:00.525 --> 26:03.525
 you know, have a certain
 characteristic because of that.

26:03.528 --> 26:06.263
 I'm holding on to
 a ball of wet dung,

26:06.264 --> 26:08.432
 and I have a hard time imagining

26:08.433 --> 26:10.901
 that it's gonna be shiny
 when I'm all done.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.902
 At the same time, I'm so jazzed
 from my shiny mud ball...

26:15.773 --> 26:17.674
 that I'm optimistic
 that this is gonna work.

26:17.675 --> 26:19.443
 These are so simple.

 You know, there's nothing
 more pure than a sphere.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.880

 Unless the sphere needs a shave.

26:26.217 --> 26:29.217
 Jamie resists yelling, "Waiter,
 there's a hair in my poop."

26:30.054 --> 26:32.356
 He just takes care of business.

 have risked life and limb

26:39.464 --> 26:42.464

 to hit the ground running.

26:43.368 --> 26:46.368

 is Kari Byron.

27:09.460 --> 27:12.460
 My strategy to keep consistency
 is I am just going to floor it

27:12.864 --> 27:14.998
 for the start
 of each one of these tests.

27:14.999 --> 27:17.834

 average these control runs

27:34.118 --> 27:37.118
 to compare against
 hitting the ground running.

27:38.856 --> 27:40.257
 GRANT:
 Now that we have our data,

27:40.258 --> 27:43.258
 the next step is to raise up
 the drive wheels,

27:44.295 --> 27:47.295
 which are the front wheels,
 off the ground.

27:47.832 --> 27:50.367
 I think this has a good chance
 of being faster.

27:50.368 --> 27:53.036
 The car's more stable,
 it's got better traction,

27:53.037 --> 27:56.037
 and the wheels are unlikely to
 stop when they hit the ground.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.609
 But there could be
 a few problems.

27:59.610 --> 28:01.278
 We could blow out the tires.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.814
 The car could swerve
 out of control.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.849
 Or we could destroy
 the transmission.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.552

 to see what happens.

28:08.553 --> 28:09.753
 That's better.

 With the engine at full revs,

28:11.255 --> 28:14.255
 this 4,000 pound car
 is rigged with a quick release

28:15.026 --> 28:18.026
 to smash into the road
 at top speed.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.764
 KARI: We've never done
 anything like this before,

28:20.765 --> 28:23.733
 so I guess we just
 have to cross our fingers

28:23.734 --> 28:25.502
 and hope everything goes
 really well.

28:25.503 --> 28:27.571
 NARRATOR:
 And if things don't go well,

28:27.572 --> 28:30.572
 well, there's no way
 anyone here can help her.

28:32.777 --> 28:35.777
 Unlike the bike,
 the car wheels don't stop dead.

28:36.347 --> 28:39.347
 But they do seem
 to struggle for traction.

28:39.750 --> 28:42.185
 The front end
 is up off the ground.

28:42.186 --> 28:44.721
 The wheels are spinning
 as fast as they can go.

28:44.722 --> 28:45.789
 I pull the release,

28:45.790 --> 28:48.790
 and it bounces off the pavement,
 skids out, and takes off.

28:53.297 --> 28:55.599
 Tires didn't pop,
 so I think we're good.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.300
 We'll be able to do
 another test.

 for a second run.

29:02.039 --> 29:05.039
 I'm standing down here
 at the end of the line

29:05.109 --> 29:07.777
 and you see
 once the car hits the ground,

29:07.778 --> 29:09.546
 a huge cloud of smoke.

29:09.547 --> 29:12.547
 I'm not quite sure, actually,
 if the car is moving towards me

29:13.518 --> 29:14.985
 until it breaks through
 the smoke

29:14.986 --> 29:16.553
 and I can see it accelerating.

29:16.554 --> 29:18.655

 Incredibly, nothing's broken.

29:49.420 --> 29:52.155
 charged by hormones
 and horsepower,

29:52.156 --> 29:54.124
 it all comes down to timing.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.125
 Was hitting the ground running
 faster than a standing start?

29:58.329 --> 30:01.329
 As cool as that was, I don't
 know if it made it any faster.

30:01.532 --> 30:04.200
 You know, I was concentrating
 so hard on just going straight,

30:04.201 --> 30:06.169
 it just all went slow motion
 for me.

30:06.170 --> 30:09.170
 All right, well, the results
 are in, and it was very close.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.440
 Now, the average for the control
 test for the whole 300 feet --

30:13.110 --> 30:15.745
 7.88 seconds.

30:15.746 --> 30:17.614
 What was hitting the ground
 running?

30:17.615 --> 30:20.615
 The average of hitting the
 ground running -- 8.04 seconds.

30:21.719 --> 30:24.220
 Yes!
 We busted this one!

30:24.221 --> 30:26.489
 KARI: And we busted the car,
 so we got to push it home.

30:26.490 --> 30:28.658
 NARRATOR:
 We've tried it running, cycling,

30:28.659 --> 30:30.360
 and now motoring.

30:30.361 --> 30:31.728
 This is one idiom

30:31.729 --> 30:34.729
 that works better in theory
 than in practice.

30:35.399 --> 30:37.867
 TORY: [ Grunts ]
 Push harder!

30:37.868 --> 30:40.868
 -KARI: Wait. Who's steering?!
 -TORY: Who's steering?! Aah!

30:48.045 --> 30:49.479
 NARRATOR:
 For Adam and Jamie,

30:49.480 --> 30:52.480
 it's been three long days
 of shaping and buffing.

30:53.084 --> 30:56.084
 But thanks to the ancient art
 of dorodango,

30:56.454 --> 30:58.221
 they've got a real chance

30:58.222 --> 31:01.091
 of actually imparting
 a polish to poop.

31:01.092 --> 31:04.092
 You know, the casual viewer
 might look at this and say --

31:04.195 --> 31:07.195
 pardon the pun --
 "What a load of crap.

31:07.398 --> 31:10.166
 Who needs to know this?
 This is disgusting."

31:10.167 --> 31:13.167
 But I'm actually
 really fascinated by this.

31:13.571 --> 31:16.571
 Even if it is a disgusting
 material, it's totally unlikely.

31:17.675 --> 31:20.675
 And yet, by really thinking
 carefully about it

31:20.711 --> 31:23.113
 and by, like, polishing
 and working it,

31:23.114 --> 31:25.615
 we've actually got
 a lovely shine on this.

31:25.616 --> 31:28.616
 NARRATOR: Of course, it's
 not all smiles and sunshine.

31:28.719 --> 31:31.254
 The balls still stink
 to high heaven,

31:31.255 --> 31:33.923
 they're unsanitary,
 and Adam's made a mess

31:33.924 --> 31:36.660
 of the pants he was going to
 wear to the Emmys.

31:36.661 --> 31:39.596
 I swear, that is as shiny
 as I'm gonna get it.

31:39.597 --> 31:41.931
 It's pretty good.

31:41.932 --> 31:43.933
 NARRATOR:
 Now, here's the rub.

31:43.934 --> 31:46.934
 What exactly defines a polish,
 and how do you measure it?

31:48.105 --> 31:50.340
 Adam's left nothing to chance.

31:50.341 --> 31:53.309
 Because the whole point of this
 exercise is to polish a poop,

31:53.310 --> 31:55.945
 the question remains -- How do
 we know when we get there?

31:55.946 --> 31:58.214
 What is "shiny"?
 What is "polished"?

31:58.215 --> 31:59.482
 Well, we've got
 a glossmeter here,

31:59.483 --> 32:02.483
 which measures shininess
 in gloss units.

32:02.586 --> 32:05.586
 And we know that anything above
 a gloss-unit measurement of 70

32:06.657 --> 32:08.925
 is considered high-gloss,
 or polished.

32:08.926 --> 32:11.661
 And I submit that
 that is our target.

32:11.662 --> 32:13.997
 First, I'm gonna run it
 through its paces

32:13.998 --> 32:16.032
 with this shiny chrome ball,

32:16.033 --> 32:19.033
 which no one would dispute
 is a very polished ball.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.339
 NARRATOR: The gloss reading
 on polished chrome

32:23.340 --> 32:24.808
 should give us some idea

32:24.809 --> 32:27.809
 of whether or not Adam's
 dung ball will make the grade.

32:28.713 --> 32:31.347
 Okay.
 The results are in.

32:31.348 --> 32:34.348
 Shiny chrome ball --
 275 gloss units.

32:34.618 --> 32:37.618
 Now I'd like to measure
 my dorodango.

32:39.356 --> 32:41.357
 NARRATOR:
 They've cramped their fingers,

32:41.358 --> 32:43.326
 lost time with loved ones,

32:43.327 --> 32:46.327
 and infused M5 with a stink
 that might just last forever.

32:47.798 --> 32:50.798
 But if they can bust this myth,
 well, it's almost worth it.

32:56.006 --> 32:58.575
 106!
 [ Chuckles ]

32:58.576 --> 33:01.576
 Remember, anything
 above a gloss units of 70

33:01.846 --> 33:04.846
 is high-gloss, and I got 106.

33:04.949 --> 33:07.949
 So I succeeded
 in polishing a poop.

33:07.952 --> 33:10.553
 Let's go get Jamie's.

33:10.554 --> 33:12.155
 Dude.

33:12.156 --> 33:15.156
 I achieved high-gloss,
 according to our glossmeter.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.760
 Not bad for, like, a lot of
 grass and other things in there.

33:20.798 --> 33:23.466
 Yeah, I got 106.
 Wow!

33:23.467 --> 33:25.635
 JAMIE:
 Can just about see myself in it.

33:25.636 --> 33:27.470
 Oh, we got to test yours.
 Come on. Let's go.

33:27.471 --> 33:28.538
 Okay.

33:28.539 --> 33:31.539
 NARRATOR: Jamie, you'll recall,
 chose the lion dung.

33:32.042 --> 33:35.042
 So in this bizarre quest
 for the best and brightest,

33:35.279 --> 33:38.214
 it's carnivore versus herbivore.

33:38.215 --> 33:41.215
 Nicely done.
 183 gloss units.

33:41.952 --> 33:44.420
 So you should know
 anything above 70 gloss units

33:44.421 --> 33:47.023
 is considered high-gloss, and
 you knocked it out of the park.

33:47.024 --> 33:48.625
 -JAMIE: They're shiny.
 -ADAM: They are.

33:48.626 --> 33:51.194
 I'd say we've handily busted
 this myth.

33:51.195 --> 33:53.530
 You can, in fact, polish a poop.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.531
 Yes, you can.
 It's busted.

33:59.837 --> 34:01.504
 ADAM:
 I hope you accept my apologies

34:01.505 --> 34:03.439
 for the early
 explodus interruptus.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.440
 JAMIE:
 Firing in 3.. .2...

34:06.744 --> 34:08.378
 -1 --
 -Wait, wait, wait! Hold on!

34:08.379 --> 34:09.779
 It's now the end of the show,

34:09.780 --> 34:12.415
 and now we can proceed
 with ending with a bang.

34:12.416 --> 34:14.984
 In case you didn't remember,
 we've got a mo-ped up there

34:14.985 --> 34:17.985
 wrapped with a couple
 of hundred feet of det cord...

34:17.987 --> 34:20.356
 It's like a spider
 caught it, really.

34:20.357 --> 34:22.125
...and about a gallon
 of gasoline.

34:22.126 --> 34:25.126
 [ Laughs ]

34:25.161 --> 34:27.130
 We're just about
 to light that puppy up,

34:27.130 --> 34:30.130
 and it should be
 pretty spectacular.

34:31.502 --> 34:32.702
 JAMIE:
 "Ends with a bang."

34:32.703 --> 34:33.969
 -Are you ready?
 -I'm ready.

34:33.971 --> 34:35.605
 -You're sure?
 -I -- Just do it.

34:35.606 --> 34:38.606
 Firing in 3.. .2... 1!

34:45.181 --> 34:47.516
 [ Laughs ]

34:47.518 --> 34:50.518
 That was suitably spectacular.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.920
 NARRATOR:
 And suitably devastating.

34:58.662 --> 35:01.662
 They've turned a mo-ped
 into a "no-ped."

35:03.801 --> 35:06.801
 But just what is Jamie's
 diabolical alternative?

35:08.572 --> 35:10.707
 Let's ask the man himself.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.075
 We're gonna make some thermite.

35:12.076 --> 35:15.076
 That means I'm gonna take this
 and mix it with this in that,

35:16.113 --> 35:19.113
 and we're gonna cut that
 in half.

35:19.250 --> 35:22.185
 NARRATOR:
 Okay. That's nice and brief.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.520
 But we'll need
 a bit more detail.

35:24.521 --> 35:27.521
 Thermite is a mix of iron oxide
 and finely powdered aluminum

35:28.692 --> 35:31.060
 that burns
 at super-hot temperatures.

35:31.061 --> 35:33.963
 We used it previously
 during the "Hindenburg" episode,

35:33.964 --> 35:36.964
 to a pretty spectacular effect,
 as you can see.

35:37.568 --> 35:39.636
 NARRATOR:
 The Hindenburg had a paint job

35:39.637 --> 35:42.405
 partly based on the
 key components of thermite,

35:42.406 --> 35:45.406
 which at least contributed
 to this historic fireball.

35:47.144 --> 35:49.679
 Thermite's also used
 to build bombs

35:49.680 --> 35:51.314
 and in commercial demolition.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.315
 So it's not the kind of thing
 you buy prepackaged.

35:54.551 --> 35:55.852
 [ Engine turns over ]

35:55.853 --> 35:58.853
 So Jamie has to mix his own --
 very, very carefully.

36:00.224 --> 36:01.858
 JAMIE: The only people
 that we could find

36:01.859 --> 36:04.627
 used to working with this kind
 of quantity of thermite

36:04.628 --> 36:07.530
 normally make
 solid rocket boosters.

36:07.531 --> 36:10.466
 And they told me that I need to
 be really careful with this

36:10.467 --> 36:13.202
 because even mixing it
 in a mixer like this

36:13.203 --> 36:15.505
 can generate enough heat
 from the friction

36:15.506 --> 36:17.240
 that it could auto-ignite.

36:17.241 --> 36:20.241
 And once this stuff goes off,
 you don't want to be around it.

36:20.945 --> 36:23.945
 So we're keeping
 a close eye on it.

36:24.381 --> 36:27.381
 NARRATOR:
 Cue the sacrificial S. U.V.

36:27.985 --> 36:30.985
 It's Adam's job
 to prep the patient.

36:32.056 --> 36:33.856
 ADAM:
 I have to remove the tires

36:33.857 --> 36:36.857
 because they don't want
 the tires to burn out here.

36:36.961 --> 36:38.962
 So, of all the things
 we're gonna destroy,

36:38.963 --> 36:41.963
 we're gonna leave the burning,
 molten rubber

36:42.232 --> 36:45.232
 out of the equation and just
 set the car down on its frame.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.007
 NARRATOR: The first batch
 of bathtub thermite

36:51.008 --> 36:53.443
 is bagged and distributed.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.444
 So I figure we stuff these
 in around the engine.

36:58.282 --> 37:00.883
 And when it starts
 to run through the hood,

37:00.884 --> 37:02.885
 it'll set them off.

37:02.886 --> 37:05.221
 NARRATOR: Now Adam's method
 gives an insight

37:05.222 --> 37:07.423
 into Jamie's madness.

37:07.424 --> 37:10.424
 He's landscaping the car
 with house bricks

37:10.427 --> 37:12.195
 to form a flaming gutter.

37:12.196 --> 37:15.196
 My vision is that we're gonna
 create a river of thermite

37:15.699 --> 37:18.534
 that's gonna rain down
 on the inside of this S. U.V.

37:18.535 --> 37:20.436
 and cut it right in half.

37:20.437 --> 37:23.106
 Now, is it gonna do that?

37:23.107 --> 37:25.408
 We don't have a clue.
 It hasn't been done before.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.076
 But it's gonna be cool.

37:27.077 --> 37:29.512
 ADAM: Something is
 just occurring to me.

37:29.513 --> 37:32.181
 This is a freaking lot
 of thermite.

37:32.182 --> 37:35.182
 Have you found anyone
 who's ever set off this much?

37:35.686 --> 37:37.220
 Nowhere close.

37:37.221 --> 37:39.255
 Ha! Cool.

37:39.256 --> 37:41.591
 Maybe somebody has,
 but I couldn't find them.

37:41.592 --> 37:42.425
 NARRATOR:
 If he could,

37:42.426 --> 37:44.894
 they probably wouldn't approve
 of this.

37:44.895 --> 37:46.396
 By the time he's finished,

37:46.397 --> 37:49.397
 Jamie's used more than
 1 ,000 pounds of thermite.

37:50.534 --> 37:53.136
 JAMIE:
 It burns at 4,500 degrees.

37:53.137 --> 37:54.771
 It's self-oxidizing,

37:54.772 --> 37:57.173
 meaning that
 you can't really put it out,

37:57.174 --> 37:59.542
 because it doesn't care
 what you do to it.

37:59.543 --> 38:02.543
 And as far as we know,
 nobody's used this much before.

38:04.281 --> 38:05.548
 It's gonna be amazing.

38:05.549 --> 38:07.417
 If this works
 the way we're planning,

38:07.418 --> 38:10.418
 if we actually achieve splitting
 this S. U.V. down the middle,

38:10.888 --> 38:13.888
 then absolutely, it's gonna be
 better than a bang.

38:14.024 --> 38:16.659
 But really, it's anybody's guess

38:16.660 --> 38:18.194
 as to whether or not
 it's gonna work.

38:18.195 --> 38:21.195
 JAMIE: Okay.
 I'm gonna light her up. Over.

38:23.834 --> 38:26.834
 NARRATOR: Don't you just love
 seeing history in the making?

38:27.471 --> 38:30.471
 Jamie sets
 the slow-burn fuses...

38:31.475 --> 38:34.475
...then moseys on back
 to safety.

38:39.349 --> 38:42.349
 JAMIE: Personally, I'd take this
 over a bang any day

38:43.187 --> 38:44.987
 because this is
 something special.

38:44.988 --> 38:47.988
 Once this stuff goes off,
 it's gonna be nuts.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.127
 I think something's

39:08.645 --> 39:10.613
 Oh, it's coming out the windows.

39:10.614 --> 39:13.416
 It's definitely
 gotten into the cab.

39:13.417 --> 39:14.951
 NARRATOR:
 Burning thermite

39:14.952 --> 39:17.952
 is tree times hotter
 than molten lava,

39:18.122 --> 39:20.423
 and the U.V. rays
 are so intense,

39:20.424 --> 39:23.424
 you can't view it up close
 without a welder's mask.

39:23.794 --> 39:26.794
 No wonder Jamie thought this
 might be better than a bang.

39:31.235 --> 39:34.235
 ADAM: Wow!

39:34.505 --> 39:37.505
 Oh, oh, there it is.
 The river's running down.

39:37.774 --> 39:40.209
 JAMIE: You can see it dripping
 off the front of the car.

39:40.210 --> 39:43.210
 Exactly.
 Oh, that's great!

39:44.948 --> 39:47.948
 NARRATOR:
 As the fire peaks then sputters,

39:47.985 --> 39:50.985
 it looks like the thermite strip
 hasn't quite cleaved the roof.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.056
 It looks like it's petering out.

39:54.057 --> 39:57.057
 NARRATOR: J. D. decides it's
 safe enough to venture forth.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.029
 JAMIE: While it didn't
 really cleanly cut it

40:00.030 --> 40:02.298
 right down the middle
 like I was hoping,

40:02.299 --> 40:05.101
 there's not gonna be
 a whole lot left of that car.

40:05.102 --> 40:07.403
 NARRATOR: But rending the roof
 wasn't the main aim.

40:07.404 --> 40:10.239
 They just want to know
 one thing.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.009
 JAMIE:
 Was this better than a bang?

40:13.010 --> 40:15.978
 I'm sort of biased
 towards saying yes,

40:15.979 --> 40:18.979
 because the amount of energy
 that was released here

40:19.283 --> 40:20.716
 was just enormous.

40:20.717 --> 40:23.085
 This was something
 that you just --

40:23.086 --> 40:26.086
 You just never see 1 ,000 pounds
 of thermite going off.

40:26.256 --> 40:29.058
 This was fantastic.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.660
 I loved it.

40:30.661 --> 40:31.961
 Well, for ends with a bang,

40:31.962 --> 40:34.163
 we got two beautiful
 points of comparison.

40:34.164 --> 40:35.932
 On one hand,
 we've got the non-bang,

40:35.933 --> 40:38.067
 and the other hand, the bang.

40:38.068 --> 40:39.802
 I like the non-bang.

40:39.803 --> 40:42.803
 Yeah, and I like the bang,
 which means we're deadlocked.
