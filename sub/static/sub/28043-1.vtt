00:41.675 --> 00:43.142
John!

00:50.818 --> 00:52.351
Why are you up so early?

00:52.353 --> 00:54.219
Mum's up my arse again.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.721
Dude, gross.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.823
Oh, not like that.
Shut up!

01:07.435 --> 01:09.334
Oh, don't kick it.
Run it!

01:09.336 --> 01:10.702
Oh, how are ya?

01:11.705 --> 01:13.839
Box of birds, Johnny.
Got my money?

01:13.841 --> 01:15.507
Oh, yeah.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.344
Why don't you use
your pockets?

01:19.713 --> 01:20.746
Oh, nah, it's safer.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.347
Not for me, it's not.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.749
Don't touch it, Terry.

01:26.754 --> 01:27.787
Put it there.

01:27.788 --> 01:28.821
Terry's gonna have to
clean that now, isn't he?

01:29.824 --> 01:31.423
Anyway, Johnny,

01:31.425 --> 01:33.425
come and have a geez
at this, mate.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.228
Kelly!

01:39.633 --> 01:41.600
You see that?

01:41.601 --> 01:43.568
That's an explosive vest,
mate, like the terrorists use.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.571
Whoa, explosive?
Mean!

01:47.174 --> 01:48.373
If you keep
interrupting me,

01:48.375 --> 01:49.741
I'm gonna blow
the fuckin' house up.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.844
Well, that's exciting, darls.
Isn't it, Johnny?

01:51.846 --> 01:53.846
Whoa, yeah.
Fuck yeah!

01:54.782 --> 01:56.115
Who's this?

01:56.117 --> 01:58.584
This is Johnny.
He's bloody dynamic.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.787
Hi.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.191
Keep your slut eyes
off my boys, please.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.660
I'm not.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.127
Finish the fuckin' vest
or you're out on your arse.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.628
Whatever.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.840
Now, mate,
a serious talk.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.843
Looks like the chinks
wanna set up shop in Thames.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.645
They wanna start using
Wah Lee's as a spot

02:26.647 --> 02:28.480
for one of their
gambling drops.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.882
<i>If we let them slide
on in here</i>

02:29.884 --> 02:32.184
<i>and start doing whatever
the fuck they want,</i>

02:32.186 --> 02:33.919
<i>they'll take over
the whole town.</i>

02:36.390 --> 02:39.424
I am considerably
irritated by this.

02:41.228 --> 02:44.396
You see, I consider Thames
to be my bloody town.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.699
I'm gonna sort
the bastards out.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.539
It's about making a point,
loud and fucking clear,

02:53.541 --> 02:55.440
that they're not
fuckin' welcome.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.409
So what's the story?
- There's gonna be a drop-off tonight

02:57.411 --> 02:59.178
and a pick-up
in the morning.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.712
Thing is, though, John...

03:00.714 --> 03:02.314
there's not gonna be
a pick-up in the morning,

03:02.316 --> 03:03.749
is there, mate?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.317
Why not?

03:05.319 --> 03:07.019
Well, come on.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.720
Cos you're gonna flog
the fuckin' thing, that's why.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.322
- Me?
- Piece of piss, mate.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.257
You can take your girlfriend,
as well.

03:13.861 --> 03:14.960
Whaddaya say, Gaz?

03:14.962 --> 03:16.895
No, there's no,
"Whaddaya say, Gaz?"

03:16.897 --> 03:18.497
You're fuckin' doing it.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.666
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.610
I always find it difficult
to talk to Shelton.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.612
Oh, it's hard to talk with
a dick in your mouth, bro.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.997
Oh, fuck off!

03:34.998 --> 03:36.381
Why do you always
grease up to him so hard?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.617
I'm not the one
running all of his errands.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.319
Well, nah. You're the one
following around

03:40.321 --> 03:42.454
the one running
all his errands.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.357
How'd he get
to where he is?

03:45.359 --> 03:47.526
Oh, it's easy, bro.
He just said, "Fuck it,"

03:47.528 --> 03:49.795
and started looking after
numero uno.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.300
What would you do with
a big pile of money like that?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.703
I'd set myself up
like Shelton, eh?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.438
Except, you know,
we'd all live together

03:59.440 --> 04:02.474
and eat pizza
and learn karate and that.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.909
Bro, like the
Ninja Turtles, bro!

04:03.911 --> 04:05.577
You could be Donatello.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.012
Hey, bro,
Donatello sucks, bro.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.380
I'd be Leonardo.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.715
He shits on Donatello.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.917
- True.
- Hard, bro.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.586
Well, then there's us,
sitting here

04:13.587 --> 04:15.254
like a couple of losers,
drinking at the bowling club,

04:15.256 --> 04:16.788
knowing that that money's
gonna be dropped off

04:16.790 --> 04:19.458
at Wah Lee's this arvo.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.560
Bro, it's just
gonna be sitting there.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.595
You know,
anyone could take it.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.464
I'm not saying us, but...

04:25.766 --> 04:27.599
Then what are you saying?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.501
Well, um...

04:29.503 --> 04:32.404
I'm just saying that it's
gonna be sitting there.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.473
Anyone could go
and take it.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.844
Shelton would slaughter us.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.779
Yeah, not if he
never knew about it.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.384
Are we talking about this?

04:45.386 --> 04:47.452
Well, we're just
talking about it.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.722
Yeah, we're just
talking about it.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.535
<i>Hey.
John, right?</i>

05:04.905 --> 05:06.772
What are you doing up here?

05:07.508 --> 05:10.942
Oh, Kelly, meet my parents
John and Coralie.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.911
Hi.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.947
Oh, do you want a beer?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.883
Yeah, all right.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.519
I think Dad's
had about enough.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.824
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.630
Pretty nice up here, eh?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.532
Yeah, I s'pose.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.601
So what's it like
working for my brother?

05:36.603 --> 05:37.636
Yeah, good, eh?

05:37.638 --> 05:38.970
Come on.
He's an asshole.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.640
Oh, well, I mean,
I'm just working for him,

05:41.642 --> 05:44.376
you know,
until I build up enough inertia

05:44.378 --> 05:45.977
and learn enough stuff
so that I can start

05:45.979 --> 05:46.878
my own thing,
you know?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.714
My own, uh, organization.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.416
What are you, then?
Shelton's bitch?

05:52.386 --> 05:53.852
Nah, I'm not his bitch.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.087
I'm not trying
to be mean or anything,

05:55.089 --> 05:56.521
but if you wanna
do your own thing,

05:56.523 --> 05:57.756
you gotta grow some nuts.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.594
Yeah, I know.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.828
Your nuts are probably
bigger than you think.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.136
<i>Oi.</i>

06:11.138 --> 06:12.871
Oh, hi, Mrs. Walters.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.574
You've gotta move out
of the garage.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.709
Patrick's coming home
from the university

06:17.711 --> 06:20.479
and he's bought himself
a car so you've gotta go.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.614
Eh?
When's he coming back?

06:22.616 --> 06:24.049
Around 6.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.517
What, tonight?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.953
Yes, tonight.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.588
Oh, where am I gonna stay?

06:29.590 --> 06:31.723
"Oh, where am I gonna stay?"

06:31.725 --> 06:33.725
You're such a pussy!

06:53.147 --> 06:54.913
Are those your nuts?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.883
I said,
"Are those your nuts?"

07:01.155 --> 07:04.122
Are... those... your... nuts?

07:05.893 --> 07:08.627
Well, who the hell
else's nuts are they?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.897
Well, I'm the only one here.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.200
Who the hell's nuts
do you think they are?

07:17.838 --> 07:19.771
You gonna make a move?

07:20.741 --> 07:22.574
It's your move.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.914
Or you gonna be
Shelton's bitch forever?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.620
Meet me at Wah Lee's at 3.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.089
Now we're not just talking.

08:37.083 --> 08:39.017
You could've changed, bro.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.953
Oh.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.595
So, you seen anything yet?

08:50.597 --> 08:51.897
Nah.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.900
Well, hang on.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.848
What's he doing?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.716
Well, the money's
in the tire.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.051
What?

09:14.254 --> 09:15.720
Why do you think
he's rolling a tire

09:15.722 --> 09:17.255
into an antique shop, bro?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.257
- You think it's some ancient tire he's trying to sell?
- I don't know.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.860
You think it might be
Napoleon's tire, bro?

09:21.862 --> 09:24.829
- A bit of tread left on it still.
- Okay, bro. Calm down!

09:24.831 --> 09:26.665
Here.
Put that on.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.570
Oi!
Where'd you get that?

09:31.572 --> 09:32.871
It's Mum's.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.139
Why'd you bring it?

09:34.141 --> 09:35.574
Well, to scare him.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.641
Who?

09:36.643 --> 09:38.209
The old man.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.646
- Bro, he's, like, a hundred years old.
- So?

09:42.649 --> 09:44.749
- So does it work?
- Yeah, it fuckin' works.

09:44.751 --> 09:45.483
Yeah, all right.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.319
- Just looks a bit--
- What?

09:48.055 --> 09:50.989
Oh, I don't know...
Shit.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.594
Oh.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.658
Where is it?

10:26.660 --> 10:27.693
What?

10:27.694 --> 10:28.727
Oh, we were just
wondering where

10:28.729 --> 10:30.128
the Chinese money was.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.864
Oh.
It's down there.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.301
Oh shit.
Have you got a knife?

10:36.303 --> 10:37.602
What?

10:37.603 --> 10:38.902
- A knife, to cut this open!
- No!

10:38.905 --> 10:40.138
Uh, excuse me.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.372
Uh, do you have a knife
we could borrow?

10:41.375 --> 10:42.674
Oh!

10:42.676 --> 10:43.808
Hurry up!

10:44.344 --> 10:45.844
Hey! Hey!

10:45.846 --> 10:47.345
Stop it.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.179
What'd he do?

10:48.181 --> 10:49.481
He was texting.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.782
Do you know who
you're stealing from?

10:50.784 --> 10:51.816
Shut up!

10:51.818 --> 10:53.218
Holy shit.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.021
I never thought anybody
would be stupid enough

10:56.023 --> 10:57.322
to steal from Triads.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.723
Oh yeah?

10:58.725 --> 11:01.026
Well, you never met
us then, did you?

11:03.897 --> 11:05.397
Hey, look,
I'm real sorry about this, eh?

11:05.399 --> 11:07.699
I hope you don't get
in trouble or anything.

11:07.868 --> 11:08.967
Oh, what's that?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.702
Nothing.
Not for sale.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.937
Oi, nah, come on.
Give us a geez.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.205
Hey, mate, what do
you reckon about this?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.106
For Kelly.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.075
Bro, now is not the time!

11:17.878 --> 11:19.277
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

11:20.714 --> 11:21.413
Fuck!

11:21.415 --> 11:22.847
Bro, multiple tangos.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.249
- What?
- Multiple tangos!

11:24.251 --> 11:25.684
Initiate Plan B!

11:25.686 --> 11:26.685
Plan B?

11:26.687 --> 11:28.319
Where's the back door?

11:28.321 --> 11:29.754
Thank you.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.357
Listen.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.726
You can borrow this locator.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.728
Very dangerous.

11:36.730 --> 11:40.065
If you use it,
Taotie will come.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.234
The demon will consume you.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.938
Taotie.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.982
Hey, bro,
if she doesn't like this,

11:57.984 --> 11:58.750
can I bring it back?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.118
Like, exchange it?

12:00.120 --> 12:03.922
You will bring it back,
no matter what.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.457
Yeah, cos
it's made in China, eh?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.860
Oh shit!
Yeah, sorry.

12:08.862 --> 12:09.961
Uh, bye!

12:25.512 --> 12:26.945
Go!

12:28.048 --> 12:29.881
Gaz, go!
Hit the gears!

12:29.883 --> 12:31.449
Gaz, now!

12:31.451 --> 12:33.084
Stop pressuring me!

12:33.987 --> 12:35.420
Oh shit!

12:43.196 --> 12:45.330
- Fuck!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:45.332 --> 12:47.499
Yeah!
Later, bo!

12:48.268 --> 12:51.102
<i>When he saw the car,
he's just like,</i>

12:51.104 --> 12:53.371
<i>"Fuck, just take it!
Take it all, bro!"</i>

12:53.373 --> 12:55.006
Oi, how mean was that, bro?

12:55.008 --> 12:57.108
I can't believe
we actually did that, eh?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.543
Oh, bro, we got it!

12:59.980 --> 13:01.546
Hey, what are we doing here?

13:02.215 --> 13:03.214
Oi!

13:03.216 --> 13:04.849
Gidday, Johnny.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.257
Ooh, bugger me days.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.097
Oh.
Oh, please, Shelton.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.131
I didn't mean anything by it.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.833
I just did the job
like you asked!

13:21.835 --> 13:23.134
Sorry, Johnny.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.370
You went behind my back.
I can't let you go.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.539
Oh, well, don't kill me!
Please!

13:27.541 --> 13:29.307
Check his pockets.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.846
What's this?

13:34.848 --> 13:36.848
A friendship bracelet?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.049
Who's your friend?
Him?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.893
Best friends forever, eh?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.262
Do you play chess, John?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.332
What?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.600
Chess, the game.

13:56.570 --> 13:57.902
Well, I don't know.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.205
See, in chess,
you'd be a pawn.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.041
Now, the pawn looks across
the battlefield at its enemies,

14:03.043 --> 14:06.144
and it realizes it's gotta
kill them or it'll die.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.314
Now, conversely,
I'd be a king.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.482
You know how the king
dies in chess, John?

14:12.319 --> 14:14.919
It gets cornered
by its own pieces.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.321
So it seems to me

14:16.323 --> 14:18.389
that I've gotta get rid
of some of my pieces

14:18.391 --> 14:19.557
so I don't get cornered.

14:19.559 --> 14:20.859
You understand?

14:20.861 --> 14:22.160
Well-- Well, then,
I'll move away!

14:22.162 --> 14:23.962
I'll do anything!
Please!

14:24.464 --> 14:26.164
Away you go.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.967
Oh...

14:29.569 --> 14:31.035
I can't.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.570
You wanker.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.973
- Who wants it?
- Yep, me.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.509
Oh, nah, please!

14:39.312 --> 14:41.279
Hey, what are you doing?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.481
You fuckin' narced him out.
You watch.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.149
Bloody woofter.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.153
Heads down, please.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.989
Dopey bastards.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.193
Oh fuck!

14:55.195 --> 14:56.327
Fuckin' shot me!

14:56.329 --> 14:58.062
Oh I--
I didn't mean to!

14:58.632 --> 15:01.032
Is this your 22"?
Who sighted it?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.083
Mum did.

15:02.084 --> 15:03.133
Well, you tell your mum
from me

15:03.136 --> 15:04.969
she did a shit job, okay?

15:04.971 --> 15:06.304
Now, give me
another fuckin' bullet.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.339
- Oh, well, I don't have any.
- What?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.408
My mum keeps them
locked up, so...

15:11.211 --> 15:12.343
Fuck me.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.945
Terry, you all right?

15:13.947 --> 15:15.697
I'm worried about my eye.

15:15.698 --> 15:17.448
All right. Narcer,
take him to the hospital.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.483
Can we take your car?

15:18.485 --> 15:19.617
Fuck no!

15:19.619 --> 15:21.486
It's five minutes.
You can walk.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.521
Hey!

15:24.591 --> 15:26.357
It's like a bloody circus.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.359
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

15:28.361 --> 15:29.694
Oh, fuckin' hell!

15:29.696 --> 15:31.362
There's been reports
of a gunshot.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.698
I've only fired it, like,
five seconds ago.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.667
I've already told you,
Shelton.

15:35.669 --> 15:38.436
You're not supposed to
discharge firearms in public.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.671
Discharge?

15:39.673 --> 15:42.073
What are you talkin'
about discharge for?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.308
Something wrong
with your fanny, Les?

15:43.310 --> 15:45.043
Nothing's discharged here,
mate.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.178
This gun got fuckin' fired.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.947
Come on, Shelton.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.599
Christ's sake.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.250
Look, we're just trying to make
a little bit of fuckin' revenue,

15:52.252 --> 15:53.685
just like you, okay?

15:53.687 --> 15:56.287
Except the difference is
I'm not fuckin' sneaky about it.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.900
All right, mate.

15:57.901 --> 15:59.512
There's no need
to fly off the handle.

15:59.513 --> 16:01.124
Sometimes I think we
should swap jobs for a day.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.528
See how you handle
this fuckin' circus.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.996
Now, piss off!

16:04.998 --> 16:06.664
Okay, mate.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.999
- Ooh, Les.
- Yep?

16:08.001 --> 16:09.500
What's the
Chiefs-Crusaders score?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.102
Hang on a minute.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.203
You there, Cheryl?

16:46.306 --> 16:47.638
<i>Push the button.</i>

16:52.045 --> 16:53.511
Push the button.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.450
Hey, push the button!

16:59.452 --> 17:01.019
You'll know when!

17:14.334 --> 17:15.599
Oh!

17:27.213 --> 17:28.579
<i>Push the button!</i>

17:29.349 --> 17:30.481
<i>Best friends forever, eh?</i>

18:01.514 --> 18:04.115
<i>Oh fuck!</i>

18:04.117 --> 18:05.516
<i>Fuckin' shot me!</i>

18:05.518 --> 18:06.717
Terry, you all right?

18:06.719 --> 18:08.453
<i>I'm worried about my eye.</i>

18:10.757 --> 18:12.457
It's five minutes.
You can walk.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.348
Push the button.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.650
Push the button.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.690
Hey, push the button!

18:45.692 --> 18:47.358
You'll know when!

18:56.769 --> 18:58.436
<i>It's a hair salon.</i>

18:58.438 --> 19:00.304
"Curl-Up and Dye."

19:00.306 --> 19:02.306
Yeah, cos you can go
there and get it curled,

19:02.308 --> 19:04.308
or you can go
and get it dyed.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.512
Yeah, the Sheila's are gonna
fuckin' love it, mate.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.847
Well, that's just what I do.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.483
I come up with cool names
for businesses.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.252
You know?
Awesome names!

19:14.254 --> 19:16.721
Actually, that'd make
a fuckin' good business, eh?

19:16.723 --> 19:18.589
Naming businesses.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.591
All right.
I gotta go, okay?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.360
Let me know
when it's done.

19:23.596 --> 19:24.929
Did you find him?

19:28.368 --> 19:29.600
He disappeared.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.869
Disappeared, did he?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.871
And you two cunts
couldn't find him?

19:34.307 --> 19:35.523
No, he disappeared.

19:35.524 --> 19:36.740
So we had him,
and he was there,

19:36.743 --> 19:38.776
and then he disappeared, so...

19:41.581 --> 19:43.614
Right.
Fuckin' useless.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.916
I'm gonna fuck off home,

19:44.918 --> 19:47.752
and you cunts
better find him.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.967
Oi, arsehole!

20:03.369 --> 20:04.902
Those guys won't
stop talking about you.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.370
True?
What are they saying?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.538
Just that you're
a sneaky cunt,

20:07.540 --> 20:08.906
and that they shouldn't
have trusted you,

20:08.908 --> 20:10.241
and that they
didn't trust you,

20:10.243 --> 20:11.609
and that you're
full of yourself,

20:11.611 --> 20:12.810
and you're a pussy,

20:12.812 --> 20:13.778
and that they're
gonna find you

20:13.780 --> 20:14.946
and they're gonna kill you.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.598
Fuck.

20:16.599 --> 20:18.249
I knew I shouldn't
have done it, eh?

20:18.251 --> 20:19.784
But you're a badass.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.370
No, I'm not.

20:22.371 --> 20:24.255
Well, you busted in and stole
that Chinese money, right?

20:24.257 --> 20:25.990
And Shelton fucked you.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.992
- You should get him back.
- How?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.528
Well, he hid that Chinese
money in the basement.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.729
You should nick it again.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.831
Hey, fuck that!
I gotta gap it.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.866
I don't want you
to run away.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.503
Why not?

20:50.283 --> 20:52.450
You get my
fuckin' money back.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.486
Oh, I can't, eh?
I'm real sorry.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.755
Use this.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.990
Get my fucking money back

20:58.992 --> 21:01.359
or I'll kill her
and then I'll kill you.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.296
Meet me here tonight.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.664
Take it!

21:06.833 --> 21:09.767
Oh, but this is in Paeroa,
and I don't have a car.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.388
<i>I don't want you
to run away.</i>

21:30.390 --> 21:31.789
<i>Push the button!</i>

21:31.791 --> 21:33.591
<i>Best friends forever, eh?</i>

21:38.031 --> 21:39.930
<i>Oh fuck!</i>

21:40.867 --> 21:42.800
<i>Fuckin' shot me!</i>

22:17.537 --> 22:19.437
Hey, push the button!

22:19.439 --> 22:21.339
You'll know when!

22:40.860 --> 22:42.727
Oh, fuck it.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.100
<i>Oh fuck!</i>

22:49.102 --> 22:51.035
<i>Fuckin' shot me!</i>

23:26.739 --> 23:28.572
Hey, push the button!

23:28.574 --> 23:30.174
You'll know when!

23:38.618 --> 23:39.950
Oi, don't.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.922
I just wanna see
what happens.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.129
What's supposed to happen?

23:52.131 --> 23:53.597
I don't know.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.032
Nothing's happening to you?

23:55.033 --> 23:56.099
You don't feel funny
or anything?

23:56.102 --> 23:57.618
Nah.

23:57.619 --> 23:59.135
Hey, so I was sitting where
you were two minutes ago,

23:59.138 --> 24:02.907
and I pressed the button, so...
we've changed something.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.875
We better talk to Jay.

24:13.186 --> 24:14.819
<i>Identify yourself.</i>

24:14.821 --> 24:16.554
Uh, it's me, John.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.757
<i>When does
the milkman come?</i>

24:19.926 --> 24:21.859
On time.

24:26.532 --> 24:27.965
Who's this?

24:27.967 --> 24:29.834
That's what I gotta
talk to you about.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.571
Chinese, eh?

24:34.006 --> 24:35.573
Yep, you're probably fucked.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.875
Oh, well, I gotta
learn how to use it

24:37.877 --> 24:39.810
so we can get the
Chinese money back.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.813
So, you stopped him
from going back in time

24:42.815 --> 24:45.983
so that must mean that
he presses it later on

24:45.985 --> 24:49.620
and becomes you by doing
everything you've done or...

24:49.622 --> 24:51.555
- Holy shit.
- What?

24:51.557 --> 24:52.857
See that engraving?

24:52.859 --> 24:54.225
It's a demon.

24:54.227 --> 24:57.528
The Chinese call it Taotie.

24:57.530 --> 25:00.898
Known for eating everything
in sight and then itself,

25:00.900 --> 25:02.600
exactly like my ex-wife.

25:02.602 --> 25:03.834
Yeah, the old fulla said.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.637
Be careful with that thing.
It's a warning.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.208
<i>That's the Wah Lee bracelet.</i>

25:11.210 --> 25:12.977
<i>It was made
in ancient China,</i>

25:12.979 --> 25:14.111
<i>where it was hidden
in secret</i>

25:14.113 --> 25:16.247
<i>by this mountain monk
type fella.</i>

25:17.583 --> 25:19.717
<i>Bro, China was fucked.</i>

25:19.719 --> 25:21.619
<i>War was everywhere.</i>

25:21.621 --> 25:23.120
<i>So to protect his home,</i>

25:23.122 --> 25:25.289
<i>the monk gave the bracelet
to a whip-arse warrior</i>

25:25.291 --> 25:27.525
<i>named Wah Lee.</i>

25:28.060 --> 25:30.060
<i>Wah Lee thought this
bracelet was wicked,</i>

25:30.062 --> 25:32.696
<i>and it would definitely
help him save China.</i>

25:33.266 --> 25:35.599
<i>But there was a catch.</i>

25:35.601 --> 25:37.968
<i>See, there was this demon
called the Taotie,</i>

25:37.970 --> 25:40.271
<i>and it came after
time travelers.</i>

25:40.273 --> 25:43.207
<i>If you meet your other self
while time traveling...</i>

25:43.209 --> 25:46.310
<i>Well, that's when
the demon comes.</i>

25:46.946 --> 25:48.846
<i>But Wah Lee wasn't
scared of a demon.</i>

25:48.848 --> 25:50.681
<i>He was, like,
"Oh, fuck that,"</i>

25:50.683 --> 25:52.283
<i>and went off
to sort out the war.</i>

26:07.266 --> 26:10.034
<i>Wah Lee got real good
at using the bracelet.</i>

26:10.036 --> 26:12.903
<i>He cleaned up all these
mongrel warlord fellas</i>

26:12.905 --> 26:14.638
<i>and saved the empire.</i>

26:14.640 --> 26:16.607
<i>He was a total legend, bro,</i>

26:16.609 --> 26:18.842
<i>and everyone wanted
to be his mate.</i>

26:19.312 --> 26:20.978
<i>He got real rich, too.</i>

26:22.281 --> 26:25.115
<i>Even though Wah Lee
was getting mad respect</i>

26:25.117 --> 26:27.017
<i>from all angles,</i>

26:27.019 --> 26:29.153
<i>and even after
the monk warned him</i>

26:29.155 --> 26:30.921
<i>about the demon,</i>

26:30.923 --> 26:33.724
<i>he still couldn't help himself.</i>

26:33.726 --> 26:36.727
<i>He wanted to know what
it was like to meet himself.</i>

26:36.729 --> 26:39.797
<i>So one day,
he snuck around the back</i>

26:39.799 --> 26:41.231
<i>and he did it!</i>

26:42.868 --> 26:44.668
<i>What a idiot!</i>

26:45.738 --> 26:47.671
<i>Soon enough,</i>

26:47.673 --> 26:49.773
<i>just like the monk had said,</i>

26:50.209 --> 26:51.909
<i>the demon came for him.</i>

26:53.813 --> 26:56.213
<i>And he ended up carking it...</i>

26:56.215 --> 26:57.881
<i>real bad.</i>

27:04.223 --> 27:06.090
So what if he doesn't
press the button?

27:06.092 --> 27:07.625
You better make sure
you all press the button,

27:07.627 --> 27:09.660
you all go back,
and you all do your part.

27:09.662 --> 27:12.730
You better pay close attention
to what each other are doing.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.965
Be careful with that thing.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.635
All right.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.670
Thanks, Jay.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.940
<i>So we can't bust
into Shelton's</i>

27:22.942 --> 27:24.842
<i>cos they'll murder us.</i>

27:24.844 --> 27:26.343
So what do we do?

27:27.213 --> 27:29.747
We get the money
from somewhere else.

28:16.762 --> 28:19.296
Hey.
Uh, everyone be calm

28:19.298 --> 28:20.431
and everything
will be sweet.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.032
Ugh!

28:53.833 --> 28:55.399
Where did you
bloody come from, mate?

28:55.401 --> 28:56.834
Oh my God.

28:56.836 --> 28:59.136
Here we have
the highlight of our tour,

28:59.138 --> 29:01.505
the fully-automated
public toilets.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.207
Uh--

29:03.209 --> 29:04.875
Hey!

30:15.281 --> 30:18.048
Hey.
Uh, everyone just, uh...

30:18.050 --> 30:20.584
Be-- be cool and everything
will be sweet.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.067
Hey. Um...

30:37.069 --> 30:39.436
can you please put
some money in here?

30:39.438 --> 30:41.038
What money do you want?

30:41.040 --> 30:42.456
Um...

30:42.457 --> 30:43.873
Oh, I don't know,
all of it.

30:43.876 --> 30:47.311
Okay.
It's just that we're a bank.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.347
We don't really have money.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.282
- Oh.
- Oh.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.985
Oh, well, um,
can you double check?

30:54.987 --> 30:57.020
I can call my supervisor.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.255
Yep.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.459
Marcus, can you
come out here, please?

31:03.896 --> 31:05.429
Yes, it's urgent.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.301
Oh my God.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.103
Hey. Uh,
we was wondering

31:13.105 --> 31:14.371
if we could have
some money?

31:15.207 --> 31:17.608
Why did you
call me out here?

31:17.610 --> 31:19.643
They said the chances
were so low.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.278
I think I'm gonna be sick.

31:21.614 --> 31:22.947
Oh, we're just wondering

31:22.948 --> 31:24.281
if we could have
some money, bro.

31:24.617 --> 31:26.250
Oh my God.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.551
We have this.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.519
It has some money in it.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.336
Hey, where'd you
come from?

31:46.338 --> 31:48.038
Bro, he got shot
the first time.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.473
What, and you went back
and saved him?

31:49.475 --> 31:51.108
Yep.
I was like, "Yoink!

31:51.110 --> 31:53.410
Got your shotgun,
bitch!"

31:53.412 --> 31:55.679
Oh, hey, bro!
Oi, blow the lock off.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.549
Oh, nah.
It's just rubber bands, bro.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.500
Bro, is this stuff
poisonous?

32:16.502 --> 32:18.201
I don't know.

32:18.203 --> 32:19.403
It kinda tastes nice.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.138
Urgh...

32:21.140 --> 32:23.440
Nah, it's all checks
and pension slips.

32:24.009 --> 32:26.443
Oh, nah.
Hang on.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.312
How much is there?

32:28.314 --> 32:30.280
35 bucks.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.448
Oh, nah, 38.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.684
Oh shit.
We're fucked.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.052
Oh, well,
it's not that bad.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.720
I mean, got enough
for some beers.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.005
Yeah, hard, bro.

32:38.006 --> 32:39.289
Oh, but you should
jump back, though.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.458
Oh yeah.
Well, can't I go after?

32:41.460 --> 32:44.628
Oh, yeah, but...
then we get less beers.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.264
Oh.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.066
Oh yeah, okay.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.317
Hey, mate.
Yeah.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.719
What's going on?

33:08.721 --> 33:11.421
He's here.
Uh-huh.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.330
Bro.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.332
So, we know how
this thing works, right?

33:24.003 --> 33:25.435
So I reckon we just
keep robbing Shelton

33:25.437 --> 33:27.037
over and over again

33:27.039 --> 33:28.638
until we get the
Chinese money

33:28.640 --> 33:30.374
and we get to Paeroa.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.076
What, you don't reckon
we need a plan?

33:33.078 --> 33:35.212
Nah.
Nah, just trial and error.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.580
As long as we do
like Jay says

33:36.582 --> 33:38.248
and go back
and do our part.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.649
Yeah, I s'pose.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.019
I gotta go take a dump.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.128
You slippery bastard.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.163
Oi! Hey!

33:54.767 --> 33:56.466
Hey, hang on.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.501
Wait...

33:57.503 --> 33:59.169
Give me a sec!

33:59.605 --> 34:01.204
Urgh...

34:01.206 --> 34:02.606
Just a sec.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.541
What the hell are you doing,
you spaz?

34:04.543 --> 34:06.176
Ah...

34:07.379 --> 34:08.578
Time's up.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.252
Jesus, Damage!

34:16.455 --> 34:18.155
Oh...

34:19.158 --> 34:20.623
Uh...

35:06.605 --> 35:08.271
I'm gotta go take a dump.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.682
Yeah, use that one, bro.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.751
Hey, hang on.
Uh...

35:21.753 --> 35:23.320
Wait...

35:23.489 --> 35:25.188
Give me a sec.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.158
<i>Sorry, Damage.</i>

35:28.160 --> 35:29.726
Oh!

35:30.629 --> 35:32.529
Oi, let other me go.

35:46.211 --> 35:47.844
We're like our own gang.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.880
The John Gang.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.715
Nah, the John Squad.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.884
Or the-- the Time Squad.

35:53.886 --> 35:56.253
Mega Time Squad.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.456
Mega Time Squad.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.891
Mean.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.727
I better jump back.

36:11.303 --> 36:12.602
Hey, Terry.

36:12.604 --> 36:13.904
Look at this.

36:13.906 --> 36:15.572
Surprise, motherfucker!

36:17.876 --> 36:19.176
Bloody ripper, mate.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.610
Are those live explosives?

36:20.612 --> 36:22.946
Intimidation purposes only,
Terry.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.514
Sometimes it's important
to let people think

36:24.516 --> 36:26.883
you've got a bit
of a screw loose.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.685
Oh yeah.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.968
Fuck.

36:33.969 --> 36:35.413
Hey, get us some noodles,
will you, darls?

36:35.414 --> 36:36.858
I could eat the crotch
out of a ragdoll.

36:37.663 --> 36:38.962
Yeah?

36:38.964 --> 36:41.198
All right, all right.
Calm your tits.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.267
He's got his own gang, eh?

36:44.269 --> 36:45.969
I knew he had ambition,
but...

36:46.805 --> 36:48.538
Coming over here?

36:48.774 --> 36:50.740
All right, well,
get everyone over here.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.509
Everyone.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.477
Yes, him too.

36:54.479 --> 36:56.746
Well, get him
outta hospital, then!

37:00.752 --> 37:02.852
Thinks he can
surprise me, eh?

37:04.289 --> 37:06.256
Cheeky bastard.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.711
Right.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.250
Looks like a fuckin'
hospital in here.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.353
Right, Sammy, you're
the best shot out of us.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.921
You take that.

37:38.423 --> 37:39.906
Go and wait
in Narcer's car.

37:39.907 --> 37:41.390
If you see Johnny,
fuckin' shoot him.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.859
Don't I at least get a gun?

37:42.861 --> 37:44.427
Why?

37:44.429 --> 37:46.263
I'm a good shot, too.

37:46.265 --> 37:47.597
This is Parawai, Terry.

37:47.599 --> 37:48.765
It's not America.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.634
We're not made of guns.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.237
Can you believe this?

37:54.238 --> 37:55.871
Terry, you can borrow
my mum's gun, if you want.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.675
Fuck!

38:31.677 --> 38:33.476
Ah, fuck.

38:34.713 --> 38:35.779
Fuck.

38:35.781 --> 38:36.813
Oi!

38:36.815 --> 38:38.081
Fuck.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.384
I got a gun!

38:46.091 --> 38:47.657
Is that you, John?

38:49.494 --> 38:50.493
Yeah.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.074
Hey, John.

39:04.609 --> 39:06.609
Yeah.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.079
I can't do it, eh?

39:09.081 --> 39:10.880
<i>Oh, thanks, bro.</i>

39:13.852 --> 39:15.118
Never said
you had a brother.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.686
- Nah, he's me.
- Eh?

39:16.688 --> 39:18.054
We're both me.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.957
Bro!
That's buzzy, bro!

39:20.959 --> 39:22.525
Far!

39:22.861 --> 39:24.127
Hey, bro.

39:24.129 --> 39:25.595
Why don't you
just go home, eh?

39:25.597 --> 39:27.497
I won't tell Shelton
or anything.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.799
I don't care.
Shelton's a dick!

39:29.801 --> 39:31.568
He's got us waiting here
for you fellas

39:31.570 --> 39:34.704
while he's sitting up there
doing fuck all!

39:34.706 --> 39:36.973
Oh, well,
it is his house, bro.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.541
Laters, bro.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.044
Later, Johns.

39:42.581 --> 39:45.815
Fuckin' wait till I tell
my mum about this.

39:46.918 --> 39:47.917
All right,
where are you,

39:47.919 --> 39:49.753
you cheeky bastard?

39:50.555 --> 39:52.989
Ah!
We have bush.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.560
What's he doing?

39:57.929 --> 39:59.896
He's being a smart arse.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.437
You reckon
he's seen me yet?

40:16.882 --> 40:18.848
<i>Ow. Ah!</i>

40:24.723 --> 40:26.890
Oi, what's with
the pedo shoes?

40:27.793 --> 40:28.992
What?

40:28.994 --> 40:30.527
Your shoes say "pedo"!

40:34.466 --> 40:36.733
Oh... nah.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.035
They say "dope."

40:39.037 --> 40:42.972
Whatever, pedo!
Shame!

40:42.974 --> 40:44.874
Shame!

40:46.011 --> 40:47.510
Oi, dickheads.

40:47.512 --> 40:49.078
Oi!

40:49.581 --> 40:51.047
Who's there?

40:51.950 --> 40:53.016
Oh!

41:00.225 --> 41:02.592
Fuckin' thing's not
synced up right.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.054
Did you see that?

41:32.524 --> 41:33.656
There's two of the bastards.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.639
What the fuck is going on?

42:17.035 --> 42:18.001
<i>What's going on?</i>

42:18.003 --> 42:19.202
Fuck knows, mate.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.104
Well, that's what
I pay you for!

42:21.740 --> 42:24.207
All right, all right.
Jesus Christ.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.109
Hey, can you get me some
of those left-over noodles?

42:26.111 --> 42:27.243
Get off the grass.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.112
There's some chips
in the drawer.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.015
<i>Get out of it,
you mongrel!</i>

42:33.752 --> 42:35.552
Oh, I need to get that
Chinese money, bro.

42:35.554 --> 42:36.786
Not lettin' ya.

42:36.788 --> 42:38.121
Oh, sorry, Gibbo.

42:39.658 --> 42:40.924
Ow!

43:05.050 --> 43:07.083
Hey, you're--
You're Shelton's sister, eh?

43:07.085 --> 43:08.685
Yeah.

43:14.593 --> 43:16.159
From the big smoke, eh?

43:16.161 --> 43:18.094
Yeah, Hamilton.

43:21.366 --> 43:23.032
Can I have a chip?

43:32.110 --> 43:34.377
Have you got anybody
to show you 'round Thames?

43:35.313 --> 43:37.246
Yeah, thanks.
I do.

43:42.287 --> 43:44.621
Have they taken you
to Piss Chuggers yet?

43:44.623 --> 43:46.189
Nah.

43:52.364 --> 43:55.965
I could-- I could
take you there at some...

43:55.967 --> 43:57.333
It's mint as.

44:32.937 --> 44:34.270
You in there, John?

44:35.907 --> 44:37.840
Last chance, mate.
You wanna come out?

44:42.814 --> 44:44.414
- Oh!
- Ahh...

44:48.186 --> 44:49.786
Christ.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.055
Are you there, John?

44:55.226 --> 44:57.126
Go on.
In you go.

45:07.305 --> 45:08.938
Uh...

45:08.940 --> 45:10.707
How old are you?

45:11.943 --> 45:14.010
Don't they
need you downstairs?

45:14.913 --> 45:16.212
No.

45:16.214 --> 45:19.916
No, I...
I like it up here.

45:19.918 --> 45:21.217
Hey. Where--
Where you going?

45:21.219 --> 45:22.351
Fuck off!

45:22.353 --> 45:24.087
What?
What's the problem?

45:24.089 --> 45:25.388
Hey, what are you doing?

45:25.390 --> 45:26.856
You're not gonna
sneak up on me this time,

45:26.858 --> 45:28.458
you cheap cunt.

45:28.460 --> 45:30.126
Oh, are you all right,
Kelly?

45:30.128 --> 45:32.028
Yeah, 'course.
I'm fine.

45:33.798 --> 45:35.498
Oh.
You two, eh?

45:35.500 --> 45:37.200
Oh, don't be like that,
Damage.

45:37.202 --> 45:39.102
Yeah, well,
too bad, bitch.

45:40.772 --> 45:44.006
Ha.
You always were a pussy.

45:55.954 --> 45:57.353
Hey, Damage,

45:58.523 --> 46:00.456
if you don't stop
being such a dick,

46:01.926 --> 46:03.960
I'm gonna whip your arse.

46:08.133 --> 46:10.333
Since when
did you grow nuts?

46:13.138 --> 46:15.071
Well, this afternoon.

46:16.775 --> 46:18.241
Ah!

46:18.243 --> 46:20.209
Ah! Ah!

46:21.112 --> 46:22.245
Bastard!
Get off me!

46:22.247 --> 46:23.446
Get off!

46:24.549 --> 46:26.382
Youse are dead meat.

46:30.421 --> 46:32.355
You really
staunched him out.

46:32.791 --> 46:34.257
Yeah...

46:36.294 --> 46:38.995
Hey, uh, what did you
wanna talk to me about?

46:39.531 --> 46:41.430
Um...

46:45.136 --> 46:47.570
Um...
Oh, just, um...

46:47.572 --> 46:50.039
Oh, just, well,
cos I gotta hit Paeroa,

46:50.041 --> 46:51.440
and, um...

46:51.442 --> 46:53.242
So...

46:53.244 --> 46:54.977
Um...

46:55.446 --> 46:57.213
What?

46:59.284 --> 47:01.484
Oh, did-- did you
wanna come with me?

47:04.823 --> 47:06.489
- Are you in there?
- Ohhh!

47:07.892 --> 47:09.892
Can't see
Bugger-all in there.

47:10.028 --> 47:11.494
Fuck's sake.

47:11.496 --> 47:13.996
Get outta the way.
Get outta the way.

47:15.166 --> 47:17.066
He's nicked
the Chinese money!

47:18.870 --> 47:19.936
Oi!

47:19.938 --> 47:21.537
That's my mum's car!

47:24.209 --> 47:25.408
Shit!

47:25.409 --> 47:26.608
Did that hit you
in the eye again, Terry?

47:26.611 --> 47:27.910
Jesus Christ!

47:27.912 --> 47:29.579
Oh, I didn't mean to!

47:30.348 --> 47:32.481
Oh, Mum's gonna kill me!

47:32.483 --> 47:34.000
Right.

47:34.001 --> 47:35.518
Show's over.
Get in the fuckin' car.

47:39.090 --> 47:40.723
Not you, Gaz.

47:40.724 --> 47:42.357
You're as useful as tits
on a fuckin' bull,

47:42.360 --> 47:44.293
and you can fuck off home!

48:23.234 --> 48:25.301
- Oh, he's gone.
- Who?

48:25.303 --> 48:26.402
Other me.

48:26.404 --> 48:27.670
Well, why
are there three of us?

48:27.672 --> 48:29.005
Did you push the button?

48:29.007 --> 48:30.206
Yeah.
Did you?

48:30.208 --> 48:31.207
Yeah.

48:31.209 --> 48:32.809
Shit.

48:32.810 --> 48:34.410
One of us has fucked-up
the time-traveling.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.545
- More than one of us.
- Well, it wasn't me.

48:36.547 --> 48:37.613
How do you know?

48:37.614 --> 48:38.680
Well, because
I'm very focused.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.549
I don't make those
kinds of mistakes.

48:40.551 --> 48:42.151
But you're me.
You're all of us.

48:42.153 --> 48:43.836
So?

48:43.837 --> 48:45.520
So we need to find
other John and sort this out.

48:45.523 --> 48:47.490
Okay.
So where is he?

48:48.559 --> 48:50.126
Paeroa.

49:17.388 --> 49:19.055
Hello?

49:20.325 --> 49:22.525
I've already told you,
you need a warrant.

49:22.527 --> 49:24.327
Nah, we're not cops.

49:28.466 --> 49:31.033
Welcome to the Come Inn.
How can I be of service?

49:31.035 --> 49:32.601
Bro, have you seen
a Chinese fella?

49:32.603 --> 49:34.136
Chinese what?

49:34.339 --> 49:36.405
There's no Chinese guy
around here?

49:36.607 --> 49:38.541
Look, do youse
want a room or nah?

49:39.277 --> 49:41.010
How much for a room?

49:45.650 --> 49:48.050
Sorry.
All booked.

49:48.619 --> 49:51.087
Except for the
honeymoon suite.

49:51.089 --> 49:52.688
Is it more expensive?

49:55.326 --> 49:57.393
It's considerably
more expensive.

49:59.731 --> 50:01.497
Ta-da.

50:04.168 --> 50:05.634
What?

50:07.205 --> 50:08.371
Tip.

50:08.373 --> 50:10.039
Yeah, I paid you already.

50:10.341 --> 50:11.607
Pssh.

50:11.609 --> 50:12.675
Cheap arse.

50:15.146 --> 50:17.079
Oh-oh, mean!

50:24.389 --> 50:25.688
Bloody late, aren't ya?

50:25.690 --> 50:28.591
Patrick's 'round the back
dealing with your junk.

50:39.237 --> 50:40.503
Oi.

50:40.505 --> 50:42.204
What are you doing?!

50:42.540 --> 50:44.340
Just making room for
my fucking car, you jippo.

50:44.342 --> 50:45.641
Bro, giz' the keys.

50:45.643 --> 50:46.776
As if!

50:46.778 --> 50:48.511
Nah, giz' the keys...

50:49.047 --> 50:50.379
bitch.

50:53.284 --> 50:54.683
You want the fuckin'
bash, mate?

50:54.685 --> 50:56.485
Oh, nah, not really.

51:01.793 --> 51:03.459
Do you?

51:07.598 --> 51:09.131
It's a bit of a long story,

51:09.133 --> 51:11.834
cos I'm actually from up
Ruamahanga ways.

51:11.836 --> 51:14.637
So, yeah, one day
I'm, like, hitching down,

51:14.639 --> 51:16.705
and this beasty as
Holden rolls up, eh.

51:16.707 --> 51:19.141
It was, like,
full original windy;

51:19.143 --> 51:20.743
like, HSV rims;

51:20.745 --> 51:23.212
like, 2.5" exhaust
with the high-flow cat

51:23.214 --> 51:24.547
and the dumped dip,
and I was like,

51:24.549 --> 51:27.283
"Far, this dude is legit."

51:27.285 --> 51:28.584
And, like, the window
goes down,

51:28.586 --> 51:30.403
and he's like,
"Oi, bro, get in."

51:30.404 --> 51:32.221
I'm like, "Yeah, mean,
let's go for a hoon."

51:32.223 --> 51:34.290
And he says,
"Hey, bro,

51:34.292 --> 51:35.724
don't worry about
the probation officer.

51:35.726 --> 51:37.593
Just come work for me."

51:37.595 --> 51:39.595
And, uh,
that was Shelton.

51:39.597 --> 51:41.497
Been mates ever since.

51:43.301 --> 51:45.367
- Yeah, great mates.
- Hmm.

51:49.140 --> 51:51.240
What about you?
How'd you end up here?

51:51.242 --> 51:53.209
I sort of, um...

51:53.211 --> 51:57.213
I, um...
I sort of blew up my school.

51:57.215 --> 51:57.880
What?

51:57.882 --> 51:59.748
Well, I was bullied a lot,

51:59.750 --> 52:02.284
so I thought, "Fuck them,"
and I blew it up.

52:02.286 --> 52:03.486
You made a bomb?!

52:03.488 --> 52:05.221
I broke in to
the chemistry lab.

52:05.223 --> 52:07.656
I mixed some shit together,
and it fuckin' blew up.

52:07.658 --> 52:09.692
I had to go to court
and everything.

52:10.895 --> 52:11.894
Far.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.696
You're the badass.

52:16.267 --> 52:19.268
Hey, um, you've--
you've got something...

52:21.506 --> 52:23.339
Nah, nah, nah.
That...

52:24.842 --> 52:26.876
I'll get it.

52:36.754 --> 52:38.220
There's Gaz's mum's car.

52:38.222 --> 52:39.655
Oh, where?

52:39.657 --> 52:41.257
Behind the hotel.

52:41.459 --> 52:43.559
I've wanted this since
the minute I saw you.

52:43.561 --> 52:45.594
I've wanted it since
the second I saw you.

52:47.899 --> 52:50.833
I've wanted this since
the millisecond I saw you.

52:50.835 --> 52:53.736
I've wanted it since
the nanosecond I saw you.

52:57.642 --> 53:00.276
I've wanted it since
before I saw you.

53:00.278 --> 53:02.845
I wanted it years ago
before I even met you,

53:02.847 --> 53:04.914
when you were
just a little kid.

53:04.916 --> 53:06.415
Eh?

53:06.417 --> 53:08.250
- How old?
- What?

53:08.252 --> 53:10.352
How old
would I have been?

53:11.656 --> 53:13.956
Oh, well,
legal age, definitely.

53:13.958 --> 53:15.591
I mean, I'm not a perv.

53:17.261 --> 53:18.561
Whoa.

53:18.563 --> 53:20.596
Who the fuck are they?

53:20.965 --> 53:22.448
I did press the button.

53:22.449 --> 53:23.932
- Well, which one of youse didn't?
- Oh, not me.

53:23.935 --> 53:25.734
I did everything
I was supposed to.

53:25.736 --> 53:27.403
You didn't.
You have to go back.

53:27.405 --> 53:28.488
Oh, fuck you.

53:28.489 --> 53:29.572
Oh, I'm sick
of going in circles.

53:29.574 --> 53:31.440
- You guys sort it out.
- What?

53:31.442 --> 53:33.709
I'm not pressing this
fucking button any more!

53:33.711 --> 53:35.578
Hey, why are you arguing?

53:35.580 --> 53:36.946
I thought this is
what you wanted,

53:36.948 --> 53:38.414
your own little gang.

53:38.416 --> 53:39.548
Yeah, Mega Time Squad!

53:39.550 --> 53:40.683
Fuck your
Mega Time Squad.

53:40.685 --> 53:41.717
I want my own gang.

53:41.719 --> 53:43.319
This is literally
your own gang.

53:43.321 --> 53:44.871
Well, no, it's not,

53:44.872 --> 53:46.422
because I'm supposed to be
the leader, like Leonardo.

53:46.424 --> 53:47.856
Oh, you're not Leonardo.

53:47.858 --> 53:48.924
I'm Leonardo!

53:48.926 --> 53:50.426
You're all Donatello's.

53:50.428 --> 53:51.694
If you stop arguing,

53:51.696 --> 53:53.729
you could probably
keep the money.

53:54.665 --> 53:56.148
How?

53:56.149 --> 53:57.632
All of you against
one Chinese guy.

53:57.635 --> 53:59.001
You could totally
take him out,

53:59.003 --> 54:00.603
keep the money
and split it.

54:00.605 --> 54:02.605
This was my idea.
I'm not splitting the money.

54:02.607 --> 54:05.241
They need to go back
and do their fuckin' parts.

54:05.243 --> 54:07.343
You won't even share
with yourself.

54:07.345 --> 54:08.811
Egomaniac much?

54:08.813 --> 54:10.246
Well, tell them that.

54:10.248 --> 54:11.714
You know,
you're such a bitch!

54:11.716 --> 54:13.449
You've got no nuts!

54:13.451 --> 54:15.618
All right.
That's enough.

54:15.620 --> 54:17.286
We're not going
anywhere tonight.

54:17.288 --> 54:18.921
We're not doing
anything tonight.

54:18.923 --> 54:21.323
It's late,
I'm weirded out,

54:21.325 --> 54:22.825
and I can't be
fucked listening to you

54:22.827 --> 54:24.393
argue any more.

54:24.395 --> 54:25.527
I'm going to bed.

54:25.529 --> 54:26.895
Oh, but you gotta
watch the money.

54:28.266 --> 54:29.565
Why?

54:29.567 --> 54:31.634
Well, cos I don't trust
these cunts.

54:36.507 --> 54:37.873
Jesus.

54:43.547 --> 54:44.947
Shelton,

54:45.683 --> 54:47.750
I've found the car.

54:47.752 --> 54:48.851
It's in fuckin'--

54:48.853 --> 54:50.619
Paeroa.

54:50.821 --> 54:52.621
You are a darling, mate.

54:53.391 --> 54:55.424
He's in fuckin' Paeroa!

54:56.494 --> 54:58.060
What, so now
we've gotta go to Paeroa?

54:58.062 --> 55:00.429
Yes, we're going
to Paeroa, Damage.

55:00.931 --> 55:02.898
Put your safety belt on,
please.

55:16.847 --> 55:18.047
What are you doing?

55:19.417 --> 55:21.450
Oh, I was gonna
take a slash.

55:32.697 --> 55:34.430
Oi, where's he gone?

55:34.432 --> 55:36.365
He went to the toilet.

55:36.367 --> 55:37.733
How long's he been gone?

55:37.735 --> 55:39.968
I don't know.
Like, a minute.

55:41.706 --> 55:43.605
Better go check on him.

55:55.720 --> 55:56.985
Bro, where's he gone?

55:56.987 --> 55:58.420
He went to look for you.

55:58.422 --> 56:00.356
Well, I was just in there.

56:00.358 --> 56:01.374
So?

56:01.375 --> 56:02.391
Well, so, if he was
looking for me,

56:02.393 --> 56:03.559
he would've found me.

56:04.595 --> 56:06.095
Oh, it's the
honeymoon suite.

56:06.097 --> 56:07.463
It's big.

56:07.465 --> 56:09.398
Oh, I better go
check on him.

56:09.734 --> 56:11.633
- Hey, what were you doing?
- Looking for you.

56:11.635 --> 56:12.735
Well, I was just in there.

56:12.737 --> 56:13.902
What were you doing
in there?

56:13.904 --> 56:15.070
Um, toilet.

56:15.071 --> 56:16.237
What were you doing
out there?

56:16.238 --> 56:17.404
Um, I said,
looking for you.

56:17.408 --> 56:19.641
- Bullshit.
- Nah, you're bullshit.

56:19.643 --> 56:21.110
Oi, watch yourself!

56:23.047 --> 56:24.980
I knew this would
fuckin' happen.

56:30.388 --> 56:32.788
Oi.
Who's there?

56:51.709 --> 56:53.542
Oh, it's freezing.

56:56.747 --> 56:58.714
Ah!
Oh my God!

57:10.628 --> 57:12.027
Bro.

57:12.463 --> 57:13.896
Can you stand up?

57:13.898 --> 57:16.064
Oi, come on.
Oi, come on.

57:17.735 --> 57:18.901
What?

57:22.072 --> 57:23.605
Oi, come on!

57:27.044 --> 57:28.110

57:37.154 --> 57:38.720
Come on!

57:51.869 --> 57:53.101
Oi, let us in!

57:55.940 --> 57:57.005
Come over here, darl.

57:57.007 --> 57:58.207
Oh, hurry up!

57:59.143 --> 58:00.943
Oh, go get her,

58:02.646 --> 58:04.980
- Aw.

58:05.549 --> 58:07.549
- Excuse me!
- Watch it.

58:07.551 --> 58:08.951
Bloody bastards.

58:11.155 --> 58:12.154
Oi.

58:12.156 --> 58:13.689
Hey, come on.

58:19.897 --> 58:21.497
Oi, drop the bag.

58:30.241 --> 58:31.173
Oi!

58:31.942 --> 58:33.575
Oi, is there
another way outta here?

58:34.879 --> 58:35.878
Ah!

58:37.014 --> 58:38.780
Just give us
the money, mate.

58:39.517 --> 58:40.849
Ah!

58:43.220 --> 58:44.653
Bloody hell.

58:55.232 --> 58:56.765
Come on.

59:01.906 --> 59:02.871
Oh shit.

59:03.841 --> 59:05.173
Oh fuck!
Christ!

59:05.175 --> 59:06.275
Oh!

59:07.945 --> 59:09.945
Excuse me, hey.
Uh, excuse me.

59:09.947 --> 59:12.080
Hey, uh, that--
that wasn't piss

59:12.082 --> 59:13.749
that was running down
my legs before.

59:13.751 --> 59:15.751
Just had--

59:15.752 --> 59:17.752
had beer in my pocket,
and it spilled, so...

59:17.755 --> 59:18.854
sweet as.

59:18.855 --> 59:19.954
I don't care
about the piss, mate.

59:19.957 --> 59:21.123
Tidy your bloody room up.

59:21.125 --> 59:22.991
And open a window.
It smells like jizm.

59:23.627 --> 59:24.760
Okay.

59:24.762 --> 59:26.194
Sweet as!

59:27.898 --> 59:29.264
Sweet as.

59:39.777 --> 59:41.043
Fuck!

59:44.815 --> 59:45.981
Jesus.

59:45.983 --> 59:47.783
Must have topped himself.

59:57.227 --> 59:59.328
- Stop pulling me.
- Oh, come on! We gotta go!

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:01.930
Oh.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:03.031
Stay back, ya mongrel.

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:04.633
Oh, you can't scare me
any more, Terry.

01:00:04.635 --> 01:00:06.218
I've changed.

01:00:06.219 --> 01:00:07.802
Oh, good on ya, mate.
You still look like a girl.

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:09.004
- You do.
- No, you do.

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:10.672
Look at that purse.

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.808
Oh, hey, Terry.

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:14.876
Oi, check this out.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.013
Whoa.

01:00:18.015 --> 01:00:19.848
Ugh!

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:22.150
Oi, why'd you
leave me upstairs?

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:23.385
Fuck off.

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:24.987
Oi!
Where are you going?

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:26.221
Let go of my missus!

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:27.756
No, she's my missus!

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:43.338
- Come on!
- Don't touch me.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.240
You're my
fuckin' girlfriend!

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.153
What the fuck's been
going on down here, then?

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:05.694
S'pose we should
fuck off, then.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.697
Might grab myself
some fish and chips.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:10.332
Come on, Terry.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:12.167
Grab the bag.
Let's go.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:34.890
Oh, Kelly...

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:07.923
Oh...

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.964
Oh nah.
Fuck this thing.

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:58.039
Oi, nah!
I need to talk to you!

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:03.378
I knew you'd be back.

01:03:07.484 --> 01:03:09.417
Bro, this fucked
everything up.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:10.852
I lost my friends,
my money

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:12.104
and my girlfriend,

01:03:12.105 --> 01:03:13.355
and now there's a fuckin'
demon after me.

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:16.224
I told you,
demon consumes all.

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:18.293
Mmm.

01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:20.929
Consumes all?
What do you...?

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:22.397
What do you mean?
How do I get rid of it?

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:23.932
Hm.

01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:26.334
It cannot stop.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:28.203
It will keep coming.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.206
So you used the bracelet.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:33.341
Blood on my hands.

01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:35.210
Well, you're still here.
How did you get rid of it?

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:37.512
There can only be one.

01:03:38.182 --> 01:03:39.114
One what?

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:40.515
One left.

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:44.085
But all the others are dead.
I am the last one.

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:50.025
You go.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:52.060
So it's gone?

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:54.029
You use this.

01:03:54.598 --> 01:03:58.500
Gave you many chances
to make much money.

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:01.203
And get girlfriend.

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:04.039
But now
you must get them...

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:07.142
all by yourself.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:12.247
Okay.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:13.548
So what should I do?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:16.218
I'm not your mother.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.919
Fuck off!

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:25.527
Boy, you no steal
my shit again.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:27.329
Wanker.

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:44.579
Well, you fucked that up.

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.014
Yeah, I know.

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:48.283
Now that Chinese
fella's gonna kill Kelly.

01:04:48.285 --> 01:04:50.518
I know.
What do I do?

01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:53.121
You can't do shit
without that bracelet.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.090
Bro, I gotta try.

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.459
Yeah, you gotta
grow some nuts.

01:04:58.428 --> 01:05:00.562
Bro, she said my nuts
were bigger than I thought.

01:05:01.164 --> 01:05:02.931
When you had
the bracelet, maybe.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.204
Well, I could just go get
the money and save Kelly.

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:12.007
Yeah, all right, then.
Go use those huge nuts.

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:14.075
Yeah,
whose nuts are these?

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.043
Yeah, yours!

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:17.145
Yeah!
Yeah, my big nuts!

01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:19.481
Yeah, go use those
big nuts! Yeah!

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:21.917
Boy, shut the fuck up!

01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:23.485
Can't sleep!

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:25.287
Fuckin' weirdo.

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.069
Ah!

01:06:57.414 --> 01:06:58.747
What are these
clowns doing?

01:06:58.749 --> 01:07:00.015
Is that John?

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:01.516
No, it's not John.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.001
He got plastered all over

01:07:03.002 --> 01:07:04.485
the inside of that hotel,
remember?

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:06.087
Yeah.

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:09.024
Just go and have a look,
will you?

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:13.762
All right.

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:24.672
We can see you on
the cameras, you idiots.

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:26.508
Initiate Theta Protocol.

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:27.442
What?

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:29.177
Save yourself!

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:30.578
Oh shit!

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.580
- Ahh!
- You all right, mate?

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:34.249
I got a fright.
I didn't mean to--

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:36.484
Oh fuck!

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:38.586
I'm fuckin' blind!

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:39.788
Hey, you all right?

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:41.122
I got shot.

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:45.093
This is so wicked.

01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:46.461
We need to get you
to the hospital.

01:07:46.463 --> 01:07:47.595
No...

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:49.764
You...
You get the girl.

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:57.405
Do you want a hoon
on my goon?

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:04.712
Maybe later.

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:10.685
What do you want?

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:13.188
I've come to save you.

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:15.123
Fuck off.

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:19.160
Well, I gave back
that bracelet, eh?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.229
Congratulations.

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:31.805
Well... I'm sorry I was
such a dick before.

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.545
Yeah, you were a dick.

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:40.448
Well, do you think you
could ever like me again?

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.216
That depends.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.488
True.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:50.191
You can't
treat me like that.

01:08:51.895 --> 01:08:53.394
You can't be a psycho.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:55.263
Yep.
Nah, I know.

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:57.732
It's like I wasn't myself.

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.870
It's like everyone
was myself.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.238
Except me.

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:07.876
You really gave
that bracelet back?

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:10.778
Yep, honest.

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:14.616
Okay.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.219
I forgive you.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:22.490
Oh, hey,
we better get outta here

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:24.425
before that Chinese
fella finds us.

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.428
Oh, at least he didn't blow
your balls off, eh?

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.029
I don't know.

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:30.631
I can't feel anything
from the waist down.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:34.402
Fuckin' finally.
On your knees.

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:36.671
Come on.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.640
Oh, not this shit again.

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:40.707
You've got your money.
Leave him alone.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:41.676
Look, darl,

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:43.444
I'm not gonna go
crook at ya.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:44.679
I know you've taken
a shine to him,

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.413
and I've got
my money back.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:48.550
But-- and you'd better
call Sir Mix-a-Lot,

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.484
cos it's a bloody big "but" --

01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:52.620
the cunt fuckin' lied to me.

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:54.221
He went behind my back.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.490
He beat my boys up.

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:57.225
Had me running
around town,

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:58.959
flat tack like a chook
with its head cut off.

01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:01.396
What sort of message
does it send my boys, eh?

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:02.931
Soon they'll all be
fuckin' doing it.

01:10:02.933 --> 01:10:04.399
You wouldn't wanna
be without your servants,

01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:05.633
would you?

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:07.569
Grab her, will ya, boys?

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:09.871
Come on!

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.238
Yeah, well, she got me
in the goolies before.

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:13.308
Well, protect yourself,
ya dipstick!

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:15.843
Get the fuck off,
Damage.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:16.978
Argh!

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:19.380
Oh, come on, John.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.749
Don't pack a sad, mate.
You knew it was coming.

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:26.521
No, leave him alone!

01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:27.622
It's okay.

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:28.623
See?

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:29.924
Said it's okay.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:31.626
He won't do it.

01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:32.994
What?

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:35.930
Nah, he's just about
to ask someone else to do it,

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:37.565
cos you're scared.

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:39.601
I'm fuckin' what?

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:41.369
Nah, it's all right.

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.404
You just haven't found
your nuts yet.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.939
Yo, blow his fuckin' head off!

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.941
Don't tell me what to do,
Damage!

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:48.509
See, you guys?

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:50.445
He just uses us
to do everything for him

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:52.647
cos he's too afraid
to do it himself.

01:10:54.618 --> 01:10:56.451
Where'd you come up
with this shit?

01:10:57.787 --> 01:11:00.021
From the coolest girl
I've ever met.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.524
She told me
not to be like you.

01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:05.827
Not to be a bitch.

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:07.261
Ooh! He just called you
a bitch, man!

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:08.529
You are so dead!

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:10.331
Hey, shut the fuck up!

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:13.301
When are you guys
gonna see?

01:11:13.303 --> 01:11:14.569
We do everything
for this asshole,

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:16.804
and he just sits up there
watching the telly.

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:18.706
And if one of us
doesn't like it,

01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:20.441
he just turns us
against each other.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:21.876
Shut your bloody piehole.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.479
Oi, Shelton.

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.581
I'm gonna get up now...

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:28.816
and I'm gonna take
that money...

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:30.718
and my girlfriend...

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.854
and my big-as nuts...

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:35.023
and we're gonna go
to Paeroa...

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:37.292
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:40.728
Don't you fuckin' move,
you mongrel.

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:42.063
Shoot him!

01:11:57.714 --> 01:11:59.747
Terry, shoot the cunt.

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:01.416
I've already shot him once.

01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:03.785
I fuckin' own you.
Now, do it!

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:07.522
Well, to tell you the truth,
Shelton,

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:09.457
you're a real nag.

01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:11.426
I don't really like you.

01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:13.361
I'm just doing this to pay
for my night school

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:14.796
so I can get a real job.

01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:17.532
Fuckin' woofter.

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:19.100
Damage, come here.

01:12:21.071 --> 01:12:23.604
I said, come here
or you're all fucked!

01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:26.641
See, Shelton?

01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:28.509
Without us,
you're nothing.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.778
You're not a man.
You're just a little boy.

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:33.581
Just a scared little boy...

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:35.383
without any nuts.

01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:36.417
Fine.

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:37.585
I'll do it myself.

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:38.886
No!

01:12:39.422 --> 01:12:40.888
Hey, Kelly.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.829
I think I love you.

01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:56.871
Oh...

01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:05.413
Bloody chink--

01:13:11.388 --> 01:13:12.387
Hey, just take it!

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:13.087
Ah!

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:15.089
Oi!
Leave him alone!

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:19.794
Ah!
Stop! Stop it!

01:13:19.796 --> 01:13:22.497
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?!

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:24.766
You're a bunch
of fucking idiots!

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:29.771
Ah!

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:33.674
Whoo.

01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:35.877
Bro, you all right?

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:41.483
Oh, yeah.

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:42.884
Well, I know what my
responsibilities are now.

01:13:43.486 --> 01:13:45.019
Oh yeah?
What are they?

01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:47.588
My mates.

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:50.024
Do you forgive...

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:51.793
the traitor?

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:56.197
Ah, yeah.

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:58.199
I've probably done
some dumb shit, too.

01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:01.135
Mates?

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:02.970
Yeah, mates.

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:29.564
Did you mean
what you said before?

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:33.134
- Did that make things weird?
- Nah.

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:35.570
Well, I feel like
a bit of a dork.

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:39.907
Hey, there's something
I didn't tell you.

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:44.512
Oh, is that
the Chinese money?

01:14:44.514 --> 01:14:45.880
Oh!

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:50.117
Oh, so what's in
the pink bag?

01:15:31.094 --> 01:15:32.527
Hey, hang on.

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:33.961
You're not a bloody demon.

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:35.997
That's that mask
from Wang's.

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.537
Yeah,
it's real uncomfortable.

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:44.171
Oh, so there's no demon?

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:45.606
Yeah, I stole
that Chinese money,

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.108
fair and square,
and I wanted to keep it,

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:49.310
but I didn't wanna
share it with you cunts.

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:52.914
Oh, hey, you know Kelly?

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:54.315
Yeah, 'course.

01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:56.851
Oh, I think
I'm in love with her, eh?

01:15:56.853 --> 01:15:58.085
So?

01:15:58.087 --> 01:16:00.855
So how about
I give you the money

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:03.691
and you let me hoon off
with Kelly?

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.927
There's a car outside.
The money's in the boot.

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:18.773
Shall we go?

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:20.358
Yeah.

01:16:20.359 --> 01:16:21.942
Hey, um, let's get
a pie first, eh?

01:16:22.946 --> 01:16:24.278
Are you all right?

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.280
Yeah.
Yeah, 'course.

01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:27.949
All right.

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:45.833
What?

01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:52.840
You gave that
money back, eh?

01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:57.311
Yeah.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:00.982
To be with me.

01:17:05.622 --> 01:17:06.988
Yeah.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:11.125
John.

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:16.063
I think I love you, too.
