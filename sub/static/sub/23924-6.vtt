00:05.893 --> 00:09.643
Murderer!
There's a murderer right there.

00:09.939 --> 00:12.661
Freeze, murderer.
Oh, that's just Garcia.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.097
But he's a murderer.

00:14.174 --> 00:16.354
He has "murder" tattooed on his face.

00:16.431 --> 00:19.342
Oh, he's no murderer.
In fact, he's my buddy.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.006
Right, Garcia?

00:21.325 --> 00:22.749
What's up dude?

00:22.826 --> 00:25.272
- Ah, ha. Yeah.
- I got to go, Sheriff.

00:25.663 --> 00:27.812
All right. I'll see you at lunch later.

00:27.881 --> 00:31.358
Hmm, looks like Garcia is a...

00:31.435 --> 00:32.725
- Rat!
- Huh?

00:32.827 --> 00:35.205
Get it off of me. Get it off of me.

00:35.282 --> 00:36.920
Ow!

00:37.413 --> 00:38.866
Have a good day, now.

<font color=#00FF00>Season 03   Episode 06</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Tommy Goes To School"</font>

01:05.126 --> 01:07.671
Hmm. The school got a new flag.

01:07.966 --> 01:10.561
Um, what is school?

01:10.786 --> 01:11.977
Uh-oh.

01:12.141 --> 01:14.756
The school year started 6 months ago.

01:14.827 --> 01:17.452
Why hasn't Tommy been in
school this whole time?

01:17.521 --> 01:18.772
Who are you again?

01:18.841 --> 01:23.827
I'm Principal Garcia,
and this is my schoooool!

01:23.991 --> 01:25.936
Uh, we just had a lot going on.

01:26.005 --> 01:27.686
Bye, Tommy.

01:28.077 --> 01:29.579
Come on, Mr. Pickles.

01:29.650 --> 01:32.038
Unh-unh-unh. No dogs allowed.

01:33.629 --> 01:39.296
Dinosaurs lived either or
4,000 or 65 million years ago.

01:39.365 --> 01:41.585
Both theories are equally valid.

01:41.654 --> 01:43.475
Children! This is Tommy.

01:43.544 --> 01:47.428
- He doesn't know anybody, so...
- I know those bullies. Hi, bullies!

01:47.514 --> 01:48.913
Shut up, Pumpkin Head.

01:48.982 --> 01:50.586
- Yeah Pumpkin.
- Knock it off.

01:50.655 --> 01:53.784
And remember,
tonight is the 1st grade dance.

01:53.861 --> 01:59.577
So, find that special someone,
or live a life of despair.

01:59.722 --> 02:02.256
Oh! That's Suzie, the girl I like.

02:02.374 --> 02:04.662
I'll go to the dance with Suzie.

02:04.739 --> 02:07.788
Tommy?
I'll decide who I dance with.

02:07.865 --> 02:10.233
You've got a lot to learn, Tommy...

02:10.350 --> 02:13.861
like how dinosaurs did exist and didn't.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.869
- Both theories are equally valid.
- She'll never go

02:15.939 --> 02:17.608
to the dance with you,
Tommy.

02:17.685 --> 02:20.422
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a nobody.

02:20.528 --> 02:21.671
Huh?

02:22.579 --> 02:25.508
- See, you're a nobody, like us...
- Hi.

02:25.577 --> 02:27.866
The bottom of the social pyramid.

02:28.038 --> 02:30.969
Suzie's a regular kid,
right in the middle.

02:31.038 --> 02:34.258
She'll never dance with you
'cause you're not at her level.

02:34.335 --> 02:36.026
How do I become regular?

02:36.103 --> 02:40.152
You'd have to work your way
up from a nobody to a freak...

02:40.229 --> 02:41.698
Ha-ha. Look at those nobodies.

02:41.775 --> 02:43.734
Move, freaks, this is nerd turf.

02:43.811 --> 02:47.972
Nerds to goths. Headbangers.
We're better than goths.

02:48.049 --> 02:54.171
Headbangers to class clowns,
to bullies, to magicians, to...

02:54.240 --> 02:55.647
Who are they?

02:55.889 --> 02:57.288
The cool kids.

02:57.357 --> 02:59.475
They're the top of the social pyramid.

02:59.618 --> 03:02.745
To get to their level,
you have to go through the jocks,

03:02.889 --> 03:04.660
the preps, the robots...

03:04.811 --> 03:07.475
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna ask Suzie to dance again.

03:07.601 --> 03:12.225
- You can't. You're a nobody.
- Suzie, hey. It's me again.

03:13.563 --> 03:16.156
Tommy, what are you, a bully?

03:16.233 --> 03:20.647
Yeah, that was awesome.
I now pronounce you "bully."

03:20.716 --> 03:22.764
Watch out... bullies.

03:28.447 --> 03:30.499
Well looky, looky here.

03:30.575 --> 03:32.116
Nice office, Garcia.

03:32.249 --> 03:33.683
What are you guys doing here?

03:33.760 --> 03:35.975
I told you, I'm done with the gang.

03:36.052 --> 03:38.538
- You got too much dirt on us...
- Yeah!

03:38.607 --> 03:40.178
And we know you're buddy-buddy

03:40.247 --> 03:41.710
- with the sheriff now.
- Yeah!

03:41.779 --> 03:45.031
What? Sheriff just comes by school
for lunch every day. That's all.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.865
Well, as an insurance
that you don't rat us out,

03:47.949 --> 03:50.553
we need you to whack-a the sheriff.

03:50.622 --> 03:52.209
- Yeah.
- What? I can't do that.

03:52.278 --> 03:55.339
But you still have "murder"
tattooed on your face.

03:55.459 --> 03:57.986
I've changed. Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:58.118 --> 04:00.264
I have a dance to prepare for.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.975
- Huh?
- Dance? Who cares about a dance?

04:03.044 --> 04:04.959
It was 1st grade.

04:05.115 --> 04:07.718
The girl I wanted to dance with left me,

04:07.795 --> 04:10.219
so I turned to a life of violence.

04:10.296 --> 04:14.053
But I have left that
life for the children.

04:14.186 --> 04:15.999
Then whack-a the sheriff,

04:16.168 --> 04:18.918
or we'll listen to all your dance music.

04:18.995 --> 04:20.921
- No!
- Pop all your balloons.

04:20.998 --> 04:23.067
- No!
- And drink all your punch.

04:23.144 --> 04:27.444
No! Those are for the children!

04:27.647 --> 04:31.884
Now, children,
there are all kinds of art.

04:32.102 --> 04:33.381
Whee!

04:34.506 --> 04:38.155
Come on, Tommy,
let's pee on this goth's art project.

04:38.224 --> 04:41.288
Yeah, pull out mine,
and I'll pull out Tommy's.

04:41.610 --> 04:45.195
- No!
- Tommy! I can't believe you bullies.

04:45.264 --> 04:47.874
Even this is art.

04:49.742 --> 04:53.679
Suzie, will you please dance with me?

04:54.952 --> 04:56.039
Tommy!

04:56.116 --> 05:00.038
You might be a bully, Tommy,
but even this is art.

05:00.161 --> 05:02.787
Suzie, wait. I'm not a bully.

05:02.956 --> 05:04.866
My science project.

05:07.443 --> 05:09.068
Cool.

05:09.136 --> 05:12.172
Come on, Tommy, cool kids to the front.

05:12.258 --> 05:13.772
But I'm not cool.

05:13.849 --> 05:17.955
- Whoa, Tommy, you look cool.
- Who wants Salisbury steaks?

05:18.032 --> 05:19.746
- Me, me.
- Sheriff...

05:19.823 --> 05:21.592
Oh, sorry. Cool kids first.

05:21.661 --> 05:23.163
- Sheriff.
- Yeah, what's up, dude?

05:23.337 --> 05:24.784
I need your help.

05:24.861 --> 05:26.919
Some guys from my past
want me to kill you.

05:26.996 --> 05:28.364
Sorry, off duty, lunch break.

05:28.441 --> 05:30.289
- Here you go.
- Oh, boy.

05:30.366 --> 05:33.445
Mama always me a sculpture
of Salisbusy steaks

05:33.514 --> 05:35.171
in the shape of my own head

05:35.248 --> 05:38.909
'cause Mama says I'm so yummy.

05:38.986 --> 05:40.928
Oh, yes, I am.

05:46.916 --> 05:50.119
So,
how's it feel to sit at the cool table?

05:52.022 --> 05:55.181
This is nerd turf. Dorks sit over there.

05:55.258 --> 05:58.818
What would be cool is if
Suzie would dance with me.

05:58.895 --> 06:01.065
Cool kids don't dance with regular kids.

06:01.142 --> 06:03.592
- They're beneath us.
- Maybe Tommy's right.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.179
- What?
- I've already danced

06:05.248 --> 06:07.037
with the coolest girls.

06:07.114 --> 06:09.840
I'll pronounce Suzie
cool and dance with her.

06:09.917 --> 06:10.996
No!

06:11.073 --> 06:13.032
- Hey, regular kid.
- What?

06:13.109 --> 06:14.343
Will you dance with...

06:14.420 --> 06:17.303
Hey! I wanted to dance with Suzie.

06:17.380 --> 06:20.873
This calls for a
Salisbury Steak Challenge.

06:20.950 --> 06:24.143
- A what?
- A Salisbury Steak Challenge.

06:24.220 --> 06:27.023
It's a tradition here
at Old Town Elementary.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.926
Whoever sticks the most Salisbury steaks

06:30.003 --> 06:33.763
to his face wins and
gets to dance with Suzie.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.221
But be careful.

06:35.298 --> 06:37.924
Many years ago, a girl named Matilda

06:38.001 --> 06:40.104
was in a Salisbury Steak Challenge.

06:40.181 --> 06:42.940
It gave her a zit that kept on growing.

06:43.017 --> 06:45.908
It was so gross that
she went into hiding.

06:45.985 --> 06:49.690
And was never seen again.

06:49.958 --> 06:51.260
Now, kids, clean up your trays.

06:51.392 --> 06:53.049
Come on. Move it. Move it. Move it.

06:53.126 --> 06:54.450
Now, I did what you asked.

06:54.527 --> 06:56.353
The sheriff is dead.

06:56.430 --> 06:57.571
Damn.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.609
You messed him up real bad.

06:59.678 --> 07:03.633
- He's barely recognizable.
- Now, we're done here.

07:03.750 --> 07:04.917
See yourself out.

07:04.994 --> 07:07.096
I have a dance to prepare for.

07:07.173 --> 07:10.016
Okay, bye. Hey, where's Johnny?

07:10.267 --> 07:13.137
Garcia must have killed him
when we weren't looking.

07:13.214 --> 07:14.426
No, no. I trust him.

07:14.532 --> 07:16.806
After all, he did whack-a the sheriff.

07:16.883 --> 07:19.308
I knew I smelled more Salisbury steaks.

07:19.385 --> 07:22.779
They're having a Salisbury
Steak Challenge right now.

07:22.856 --> 07:24.248
Yay!

07:24.325 --> 07:25.915
Hmm.

07:25.992 --> 07:28.407
And...

07:28.484 --> 07:29.976
Salisburys down.

07:30.053 --> 07:33.123
Tommy wins the Salisbury
Steak Challenge.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.561
Suzie, now will you dance with me?

07:37.638 --> 07:38.885
- No.
- Huh?

07:38.962 --> 07:40.753
I'm not some trophy to be won

07:40.830 --> 07:43.332
by sticking Salisbury
steaks to your face.

07:43.409 --> 07:47.794
I don't care how cool you are...
and you're really cool.

07:47.871 --> 07:51.942
But I would be a nobody
again just to dance with you.

07:52.019 --> 07:53.232
Really?

07:53.309 --> 07:54.452
Now, I'll go to the dance with you.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.070
- Everybody, look.
- Huh?

07:57.147 --> 07:59.316
- Tommy, how could you?
- What?

07:59.393 --> 08:02.085
Don't worry, Suzie. It's cool.

08:02.162 --> 08:03.342
Ew, Tommy.

08:03.419 --> 08:06.279
That's something I would never do.

08:06.356 --> 08:08.358
This is for pushing me into the trash.

08:08.435 --> 08:12.571
What? No. Let me out.

08:12.711 --> 08:15.959
Hello? Hello?

08:16.232 --> 08:18.434
Is somebody there?

08:19.666 --> 08:22.071
Oh, it was just a cat.

08:23.491 --> 08:25.315
What are you?

08:25.478 --> 08:27.870
It was 1st grade.

08:27.939 --> 08:29.953
I was in a Salisbury Steak Challenge

08:30.056 --> 08:32.804
over a boy named Toby
I wanted to dance with,

08:32.874 --> 08:35.164
but I got a zit on my face...

08:35.232 --> 08:37.828
That kept growing? You're Matilda.

08:37.931 --> 08:41.280
I've lived down here
in shame ever since.

08:41.357 --> 08:43.458
Nobody would dance with me.

08:43.535 --> 08:45.418
I'm gross.

08:45.495 --> 08:47.563
I would dance with you.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.961
Really?

08:50.366 --> 08:52.202
Okay, I'm ready.

08:52.279 --> 08:53.304
Ew.

08:53.381 --> 08:57.506
Now, the perfect selfie will
make your followers jealous,

08:57.583 --> 09:01.067
but also conceal the
emptiness inside you.

09:01.144 --> 09:04.885
All 1st graders,
head to to the 1st grade dance.

09:05.663 --> 09:08.908
Now, when we find Garcia,
I want you to whack him.

09:08.985 --> 09:11.087
- Whacky whack whack, okay?
- Yoink.

09:11.164 --> 09:14.024
Hey! What you do that for, huh?

09:14.101 --> 09:15.525
Huh.

09:16.326 --> 09:19.390

Look,
Tommy's gonna dance with a giant zit.

09:35.178 --> 09:38.148
- She's a freak.
- She's worse than a freak.

09:38.225 --> 09:40.082
She's a monster.

Monster. Monster.

Everybody, shut up!

09:46.650 --> 09:48.098

09:48.785 --> 09:51.609
If there's one thing I've learned today,

09:51.771 --> 09:54.594
it's that it's not right to judge people

09:54.742 --> 09:56.414
just 'cause they're different.

09:56.483 --> 09:58.958
- Hey, what you doing?

09:59.027 --> 10:00.425
Ah, ah, ah, ahh!

10:00.502 --> 10:03.351
But it's what's on the

- Where's my group?
- Are you a cool kid?

10:20.400 --> 10:23.126
- No. Are you a nerd?
- We all look the same.

10:23.203 --> 10:25.284
Because we are all the same,

no matter if you got tattoos
on your face or feet for hands.
