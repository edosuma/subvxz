Oh, my God. You're my favorite
bartender. Thank you!

00:09.171 --> 00:12.140
Oh, my God. What is that?

00:12.174 --> 00:14.108
Is it not good? I'm still
learning how to make drinks.

00:14.143 --> 00:16.844
I'm better at shots.
Want a birthday shot?

00:16.879 --> 00:18.947
I think I'm good.

00:18.981 --> 00:20.648
So, any special birthday plans?

00:20.683 --> 00:23.084
No, she's just gonna go
to the movies alone, as usual.

00:23.118 --> 00:25.086
No, I'm not, actually.
Uh, this year...

00:25.120 --> 00:28.256
Nick asked me
to spend the day with him.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.757
That's so sweet. I mean,
what are you gonna do?

00:29.792 --> 00:31.125
Something special?

00:31.160 --> 00:32.827
Maybe. You know,
whatever Nick wants to do.

00:32.861 --> 00:34.495
I'm not really a birthday person.

00:34.530 --> 00:37.999
- Please. - I do have a lot
of expectations for people.

00:38.033 --> 00:40.301
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God.

00:44.373 --> 00:46.107
"Made in China"?!

00:46.141 --> 00:48.476
Are you taking me to China?!

00:49.712 --> 00:51.613
And that's why, a long time ago,

00:51.647 --> 00:54.682
I decided that I would spend
my birthday alone at the movies.

00:54.717 --> 00:56.851
It's just... safer, you know?

00:56.885 --> 00:59.988
No getting your hopes up,
no getting let down.

01:00.022 --> 01:01.723
Well, I know how you feel
about movies.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.659
I mean, my parents took me
to see Witness

01:04.693 --> 01:06.361
and then they never came back.

01:06.395 --> 01:08.363
- What? - I can really quote
that movie though.

01:08.397 --> 01:10.898
"Be careful out
among them English."

01:11.900 --> 01:13.134
But enough about me!

01:13.168 --> 01:14.969
I am talking your ear off, lady,

01:15.004 --> 01:16.304
and it's your birthday.

01:16.338 --> 01:18.206
This year's gonna be different.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.308
Maybe Nick has something big
planned, maybe not.

01:20.342 --> 01:22.176
I'm gonna be chill.

01:22.211 --> 01:23.578
No expectations.

01:23.612 --> 01:25.580
Low maintenance.
No maintenance.

01:25.614 --> 01:26.914
I'm just gonna be
one of those...

01:26.949 --> 01:28.549
cool girlfriends,
like in the movies.

01:28.584 --> 01:30.652
She just, like, has bed head
and she wears,

01:30.686 --> 01:33.388
like, men's shirts and
she's just like, "Yeah, cool.

01:33.422 --> 01:35.890
"I'll wear, like, men's shirts
and, like, sneakers and stuff.

01:35.924 --> 01:37.892
And, like, I don't care
about how I look."

01:39.528 --> 01:41.829
Hey. Hey.

01:41.864 --> 01:44.699
She has no idea about the party.

01:46.935 --> 01:48.736
Uh, Winston's STD-free.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.242
- Whew! It was a close call. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:54.276 --> 01:56.010
Yeah. Yeah.

01:56.045 --> 01:58.613
Close call, y'all.

Do you guys
know how hard it's been

02:08.890 --> 02:10.958
for me to keep this party
a secret?

02:10.993 --> 02:13.461
Nick, it's been an inspiration,
and that's why we're

02:13.495 --> 02:14.929
gonna help you cross
that finish line, okay?

02:14.963 --> 02:16.064
This is our Rudy.

02:16.098 --> 02:17.432
Very condescending
but thank you.

02:17.466 --> 02:19.367
Right on.
All right, team check-in.

02:19.401 --> 02:20.802
Coach, where we at
with decorations?

02:20.836 --> 02:22.136
- I forgot.
- Wait, what?

02:22.171 --> 02:24.572
Psych! I'm the
best at stuff.

02:24.606 --> 02:27.942
I don't forget stuff.
First place!

02:27.976 --> 02:29.877
Wait. Why are you
first place?

02:29.912 --> 02:31.612
I dominated
on cake patrol.

02:31.647 --> 02:33.047
And thank you
for getting that cake.

02:33.082 --> 02:34.482
You don't have to add
the "patrol."

02:34.516 --> 02:36.250
Decorations beats cake.

02:36.285 --> 02:38.953
Uh, no. Cake definitely
beats decorations.

02:38.987 --> 02:41.889
- Oh, really? Let's do a word association
game, okay? - Yeah. I'm in, I'm in.

02:41.924 --> 02:44.559
- Birthday.
- Decorations. Wait, what'd I say?

02:44.593 --> 02:46.561
Okay, Schmidt, are you ready
to transport all electronics

02:46.595 --> 02:48.096
to the party venue?

02:48.130 --> 02:50.498
By "electronics," you mean
this itty-bitty flash drive

02:50.532 --> 02:53.134
that I can fit in my pocket
and that is light as air?

02:53.168 --> 02:54.569
I need a verbal confirmation.

02:54.603 --> 02:56.637
You insult me. Yes.

02:56.672 --> 02:58.573
Cece, you ready to cover
my shift tomorrow with Mike?

02:58.607 --> 03:00.341
Born ready. Yes.

03:00.376 --> 03:02.577
Oh. You're giving your Saturday
to Cece?

03:02.611 --> 03:05.747
That's cool.
That's really wonderful.

03:05.781 --> 03:07.949
Can you tell
I'm being sarcastic?

03:07.983 --> 03:09.617
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, it's pretty clear. - I'm ready.

03:09.651 --> 03:10.952
You set fire to soda water.

03:10.986 --> 03:12.286
Who does that?

03:12.321 --> 03:13.521
How do you even possibly do that?

03:13.555 --> 03:14.956
It's not a flammable thing.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.924
It's not even...
Are you a witch?

03:16.959 --> 03:18.292
Mike...

03:18.327 --> 03:20.762
I hate all of you
hipsters so much...

03:20.796 --> 03:22.330
Okay, and I'm gonna be
on Jess Watch.

03:22.364 --> 03:23.831
I'm gonna make sure
she doesn't see anything

03:23.866 --> 03:25.600
that will ruin the surprise
of this party

03:25.634 --> 03:28.202
that has taken everything
from me,

03:28.237 --> 03:30.638
emotionally and physically
and financially.

03:30.672 --> 03:31.639
So what do you have
planned for the day?

03:31.673 --> 03:34.142
A big surprise party.

03:34.176 --> 03:35.777
Next.

03:35.811 --> 03:37.545
Right, but before then.

03:37.579 --> 03:41.682
The party's at 7:00. What do you
have planned b-before that?

03:41.717 --> 03:44.051
- Wait...
- Nick, you need a plan, okay?

03:44.086 --> 03:47.288
I don't care what Jess says.
She's going to expect something.

03:47.322 --> 03:49.657
I have to plan a birthday
before the birthday?

03:49.691 --> 03:51.159
The whole day is the birthday.
This is a very big deal.

03:51.193 --> 03:53.294
This is your first birthday
together as a couple.

03:53.328 --> 03:56.564
All right, you know what?
It's gonna be okay.

03:56.598 --> 04:00.067
It's her birthday. That girl's
gonna want to sleep in.

04:00.102 --> 04:02.737
My day is not starting
till noon.

04:06.708 --> 04:09.577
This is the time
I was born.

04:09.611 --> 04:12.180
I'm wide awake.

04:12.214 --> 04:16.216
It's my birthday.

04:19.757 --> 04:21.558
My day started earlier
than I thought.

04:21.591 --> 04:24.294
I got to slow down breakfast.

04:24.328 --> 04:26.863
What's going on with you guys?
Nick, first of all, blessings.

04:26.897 --> 04:29.065
Um, second of all,
there may have been

04:29.100 --> 04:30.834
a possible mix-up
with the cake.

04:30.868 --> 04:31.935
Possibly.

04:31.969 --> 04:34.804
"See You in Hell, Boomer"?
Oh, my God

04:34.839 --> 04:37.407
What part of you thought
this was Jess's cake?

04:37.441 --> 04:38.975
I thought it was an inside joke.

04:39.009 --> 04:41.211
- I'll do the cake.
- No, I am the cake patrol.

04:41.245 --> 04:42.812
Both of you do the cake.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.347
I'm considering
this problem solved.

04:44.381 --> 04:46.416
Hey, speaking of problems,
do you want me to go check up

04:46.450 --> 04:48.251
on Cece at the bar today?
I don't think that's necessary.

04:48.285 --> 04:50.753
All right, I'll do it.
But you owe me one, bro.

04:50.788 --> 04:53.189
I need to make
a 90-minute omelet.

04:54.592 --> 04:57.727
I love my birthday breakfast.

04:57.761 --> 04:59.229
I can't believe you were gonna
make this all yourself.

04:59.263 --> 05:00.864
It would've taken you hours.

05:00.898 --> 05:02.832
I know. And with your help,
it took six minutes.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.567
I know. I'm so fast.

05:04.602 --> 05:06.736
What do you say
we go into my bedroom

05:06.770 --> 05:08.872
and, uh, slow things down?

05:08.906 --> 05:10.773
Ooh.

05:10.808 --> 05:12.609
Wow.

05:12.643 --> 05:15.278
That's the fastest
it's ever taken.

05:15.312 --> 05:17.514
I know. You just look
very pretty.

05:19.150 --> 05:21.217
So, you want to take
a long nap?

05:21.252 --> 05:23.553
Oh. Um...

05:23.587 --> 05:25.955
If that's what you
have planned, then, yes,

05:25.990 --> 05:27.457
let's take a long nap.

05:27.491 --> 05:30.960
Perfect. Maybe for,
like, six, seven hours?

05:32.062 --> 05:33.163
Hmm...

05:33.197 --> 05:35.131
It's just
such a nice day outside...

05:35.166 --> 05:37.133
Yeah. Um, so let's take, uh...

05:37.168 --> 05:39.769
let's take this party outside.

05:39.803 --> 05:42.772
- Sure.
- Next up on the agenda is...

05:42.806 --> 05:44.240
it's lunch.

05:44.275 --> 05:45.775
It's 8:30 in the morning.

05:45.809 --> 05:47.977
Oh, my God, it's so early.

05:52.283 --> 05:53.716
What are you doing here, Schmidt?

05:53.751 --> 05:55.585
Nick thought
you might need some help.

05:55.619 --> 05:56.953
Yeah, well, I don't, okay?

05:56.987 --> 05:58.454
So... you can go.

05:58.489 --> 05:59.722
Maybe I'll just stay
for a little bit.

05:59.757 --> 06:01.457
Double-tap some Insta-G's.

06:01.492 --> 06:03.893
Okay.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.562
Oh, hey, Mike.

06:05.596 --> 06:07.597
I cleaned the glasses.

06:07.631 --> 06:10.166
Oh, wow, a bunch of broken
glass in the ice tub.

06:10.201 --> 06:12.669
- That'll be fun for me to clean up.
- I'm sorry. Um...

06:12.703 --> 06:14.304
I'm not gonna cover
for you like Nick does, okay?

06:14.338 --> 06:16.239
I promise you that.
And don't make eyes at me

06:16.273 --> 06:18.608
because it's not gonna work
because I'm super gay.

06:18.642 --> 06:19.809
When I look at you,
I just see...

06:19.843 --> 06:21.578
You know, it's fine,

06:21.612 --> 06:22.912
but it's bumpy, it's creepy.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.814
Eh.

06:24.848 --> 06:26.115
Doesn't do anything.
It's like...

06:26.150 --> 06:27.750
looking at this, it's like a...

06:27.785 --> 06:30.353
it's-it's-it's-it's-it's...
it's not o...

06:30.387 --> 06:32.455
it's not a good...
it's not good.

06:32.489 --> 06:36.192
- Okay.
- This, all this, everything you got, eh.

06:36.227 --> 06:39.295
Three out of... six.

06:40.798 --> 06:43.132
Damn shame
about that cake, Winston.

06:43.167 --> 06:46.269
Looks like someone dominated
their party task.

06:46.303 --> 06:48.471
"Coach, where are
all the kazoos?"

06:48.505 --> 06:50.707
All over your face.

06:50.741 --> 06:52.542
I'll pick those up.

06:52.576 --> 06:54.811
Or maybe in my spare time...

06:54.845 --> 06:56.646
I'll make a cake.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.117
Just back off, Coach.

07:01.151 --> 07:02.652
What's up, Nick?

07:02.686 --> 07:03.953
- How's the cake situation?
- Cake's good.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.221
Can I just see the phone?

07:05.256 --> 07:06.422
- Can I see the phone really quick? Got it.
- Dude, get...

07:06.457 --> 07:07.790
Hey. Cake's good, man.
I'm on top of it.

07:07.825 --> 07:09.626
So, how's your plan
working out?

07:09.660 --> 07:11.661
Okay, I have no plan.
I'm just winging it, okay?

07:11.695 --> 07:13.296
I panicked
and took her to a drugstore.

07:13.330 --> 07:15.198
She's getting
a free diabetes test.

07:15.232 --> 07:16.866
I don't know where to take her.
Is it safe to bring her home?

07:16.900 --> 07:19.869
- Hey.
- Oh! The birthday girl!

07:19.903 --> 07:22.305
I got the test.
My blood sugar is normal.

07:22.339 --> 07:24.207
Already? You did that...
all that already?

07:24.241 --> 07:27.143
- Yeah.
- Birthday girl gets, all your favorite...

07:27.177 --> 07:29.579
Next activity.

07:29.613 --> 07:31.047
I see what you're
trying to do here, man.

07:31.081 --> 07:32.015
You're trying to show me up.

07:32.049 --> 07:34.050
What are you talking
about, Bish?

07:34.084 --> 07:35.852
I'm referring to basketball.

07:35.886 --> 07:38.321
When we used to play back in the
day, no matter how open I was,

07:38.355 --> 07:40.323
you never passed me the ball,
you never let me shoot.

07:40.357 --> 07:42.392
You just couldn't
stand to let me shine.

07:42.426 --> 07:45.328
Your nostrils are flaring
so much right now,

07:45.362 --> 07:47.730
it's distracting.

07:47.765 --> 07:49.599
I'm done letting you
run the court.

07:49.633 --> 07:51.434
I'm building my own court.

07:51.468 --> 07:55.338
And it's gonna be bigger
and yummier than yours.

07:55.372 --> 07:57.573
Are you challenging me
to a bake-off, Bish?

07:57.608 --> 08:00.376
Yes, I am challenging
you to a bake-off.

08:00.411 --> 08:02.845
Okay. Well, then, I'll...
do the countdown.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.348
You know what? I'll do
the countdown then.

08:05.382 --> 08:07.684
The countdown begins

08:07.718 --> 08:09.585
when this timer goes off.

08:15.092 --> 08:17.360
You set the timer
for 20 minutes.

08:20.664 --> 08:23.766
I'm gonna make a cake so moist,

08:23.801 --> 08:26.736
girls are gonna be, like,
"Ew. Why do you say moist?

08:26.770 --> 08:28.638
I hate that word."

08:28.672 --> 08:30.740
I'm gonna be, like,
"Just taste the cake."

08:30.774 --> 08:32.975
And they're gonna be, like,
"Damn, it's moist!"

08:34.510 --> 08:35.410
And...

08:35.446 --> 08:36.979
- Bake!
- Okay, bake!

08:37.014 --> 08:38.014
- I said it first.
- I said it first.

08:38.048 --> 08:39.082
- I said it first.
- I said it first.

an old-fashioned,

08:42.019 --> 08:45.722
and she got gin in a mug
with a peanut in it.

08:45.756 --> 08:48.224
- I'll fix it.
- Make me an old-fashioned right now,

08:48.258 --> 08:49.592
or I'm gonna call the manager.

08:49.626 --> 08:51.260
And I want to
talk to him anyway,

08:51.295 --> 08:52.628
because he's just gorgeous.

08:52.663 --> 08:55.398
I want to be a
barnacle on his ship.

08:55.432 --> 08:57.400
Just hanging on by my mouth,

08:57.434 --> 09:00.269
getting all the
nutrients I need.

09:00.304 --> 09:02.105
Okay, an old-fashioned, an
old-fashioned, an old-fashioned.

09:02.139 --> 09:04.107
If it's old-fashioned,
it probably has something like...

09:04.141 --> 09:06.175
- absinthe...
- Oh, the old-fashioned.

09:06.210 --> 09:09.112
One of my favorite drinks;
a classic cocktail.

09:10.647 --> 09:13.449
Just a half ounce of simple syrup.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.956
Splash of water,
two dashes of bitters.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.591
Mix that up
with some ice.

09:21.625 --> 09:24.927
And then, you know
my personal favorite.

09:24.962 --> 09:27.096
You know, and just,
far be it from me,

09:27.131 --> 09:28.598
but the bourbon whiskey.

09:28.632 --> 09:30.767
- Bourbon.
- Two ounces of bourbon whiskey.

09:30.801 --> 09:33.202
No. Hmm.

09:33.237 --> 09:35.638
- It's not the Scotch whiskey.
- It's...

09:35.672 --> 09:36.873
No, it's certainly not the vermouth.

09:36.907 --> 09:38.174
Vermouth would be insane.

09:38.208 --> 09:39.675
Yes, the bourbon whiskey.

09:39.710 --> 09:42.211
My favorite.
Wonderful.

09:43.547 --> 09:45.848
Look at that. Old-fashioned.

09:45.883 --> 09:49.452
Hmm. Old-fashioned?

09:49.486 --> 09:52.822
Oh, my stars and garters,
you made a drink.

09:52.856 --> 09:55.258
Holy crud.

09:59.029 --> 10:01.397
Yes, Nick!

10:01.432 --> 10:03.199
I have the electronics!

10:03.233 --> 10:04.967
Do you know any, like,
time-consuming

10:05.002 --> 10:07.503
and free activities
in Griffith Park?

10:07.538 --> 10:09.839
Gross! Suicide?

10:09.873 --> 10:11.374
Schmidt, please.
I need some a...

10:11.408 --> 10:14.844
Well, just figure
it out, dude!

10:14.878 --> 10:17.213
- Oh, it's my mom.
- Okay, um,

10:17.247 --> 10:18.848
found the biggest rock
I could carry.

10:18.882 --> 10:20.917
It was this one. Um...

10:20.951 --> 10:22.351
- It's heavy.
- It's huge. Yeah, heavy.

10:22.386 --> 10:23.986
Oh, my God. Um...

10:24.021 --> 10:25.755
what are we doing here?

10:25.789 --> 10:29.225
It's not that I'm not
having fun, 'cause I am.

10:29.259 --> 10:31.928
It's okay if you didn't
plan anything for my birthday.

10:31.962 --> 10:33.496
Are you kidding?!
Really, Nick.

10:33.530 --> 10:35.031
Not only did I
plan something,

10:35.065 --> 10:37.066
but my plan's about
to blow your mind.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.669
- Honestly.
- You need to trust me a little bit.

10:39.703 --> 10:42.538
'Cause everything is about
to be made very clear

10:42.573 --> 10:44.607
- very soon.
- Oh, my God!

10:44.641 --> 10:46.442
What?
Nick!

10:48.312 --> 10:49.879
- You're the best.
- I'm amazing.

10:49.913 --> 10:51.514
- I'm so surprised!
- I'm so surprised.

10:51.548 --> 10:53.950
- This is amazing!
- It's amazing!

10:53.984 --> 10:56.385
- This is amazing! Yay!
- Oh, son of a bitch!

10:56.420 --> 10:57.787
- Oh!
- Don't touch anything!

10:57.821 --> 11:00.089
- It'll ruin the surprise! Yeah.
- Yay!

11:00.123 --> 11:01.524
- Yes.
- Yeah...!

11:01.558 --> 11:03.926
- Yay!
- Hey, Jess, let's get out of here

11:03.961 --> 11:05.728
- before anything ruins this
perfect moment. - Ooh!

11:05.762 --> 11:08.030
I wouldn't t... Wait because
we've got a whole, uh, ceremony.

11:08.065 --> 11:09.699
No!

11:09.733 --> 11:12.535
That lady took my birthday!

11:12.569 --> 11:15.571
What is happening?

11:22.557 --> 11:24.358
- Jess! Look, look, I'm sorry, Jess.
- No, no, no, Nick,

11:24.392 --> 11:27.027
I just... I don't know why
I get so crazy about birthdays.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.530
You know, it's crazy,
'cause you had a very

11:29.564 --> 11:31.064
fun day put together.

11:31.099 --> 11:33.267
Eggs and sex and...

11:33.301 --> 11:35.769
and a really long uphill walk.

11:35.804 --> 11:38.005
And, um... look, um,

11:38.039 --> 11:40.374
that's amazing for you,
you know?

11:40.408 --> 11:41.742
For me?

11:41.776 --> 11:43.710
You're not a guy who plans things.

11:44.946 --> 11:47.014
- Maybe I am.
- Look...

11:47.048 --> 11:49.249
every day, you show me,
in your own way,

11:49.284 --> 11:50.918
how you care about me.

11:50.952 --> 11:53.253
Like when you pick up
rubber bands on the sidewalk.

11:53.288 --> 11:55.689
- For your ponytail.
- I could not be more fine.

11:55.723 --> 11:58.625
I'm super chill.

11:58.660 --> 12:00.594
I'm just gonna go home for a second.

12:00.628 --> 12:02.229
- Bye.
- Jess, let's keep... Jess!

12:02.263 --> 12:04.498
Don't follow me.

12:06.134 --> 12:08.635
- Sure you know how to tap a keg?
- How hard could it be?

12:08.670 --> 12:11.071
It's beer, for crying out loud.
It's the drink of idiots.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.540
- Wait. Nick told me something about...
- Cece, look, I got... I got it.

12:13.575 --> 12:16.143
- Ooh, there's a knob back here.
- I got it in.

12:16.177 --> 12:18.278
He told me if I turn this,
I shoulde able to...

12:18.313 --> 12:20.814
- Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, no!
- Turn it off!

12:20.849 --> 12:22.449
- Oh, sorry! It's just...
- Turn it off!

12:22.484 --> 12:25.085
Oh.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.221
You butt hole.

12:27.255 --> 12:29.623
You can't do anything
right, can you?

12:29.657 --> 12:32.092
I'm so sorry.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.765
He's right, though.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.300
I can't do anything.

12:40.335 --> 12:42.236
No skills.

12:42.270 --> 12:45.172
I told you this, but I didn't
even graduate high school.

12:45.206 --> 12:47.574
A lot of people
never graduated high school.

12:47.609 --> 12:49.910
Okay-- Einstein, Bill Gates,

12:49.944 --> 12:52.279
Anne Frank.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.081
I'm gonna take back that last one.

12:54.115 --> 12:56.016
Why did I think
that I could bartend?

12:56.050 --> 12:58.752
Because you can.

12:58.786 --> 13:01.255
You are strong, and
you are confident.

13:01.289 --> 13:02.923
Those are skills. Use them.

13:02.957 --> 13:05.292
And be a little bit
meaner to the people here.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.928
It should be easy for you.
Just pretend that they're me.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.164
You're right. That is easy.

13:11.199 --> 13:12.799
And pull your shirt down
a little bit.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.167
This isn't a monastery.

13:14.202 --> 13:15.335
Do not push your luck with me.

13:15.370 --> 13:17.671
I'll look away.

13:17.705 --> 13:19.673
You're wearing
paper towels. Behind!

13:19.707 --> 13:21.108
No it's
an environmental-friendly,

13:21.142 --> 13:22.676
recyclable apron.

13:22.710 --> 13:25.112
- Behind! Behind!
- Okay, real... really? Okay.

13:25.146 --> 13:26.513
- Behind.
- Behind.

13:26.548 --> 13:27.781
- Behind!
- Behind! Behind.

13:27.815 --> 13:29.383
Whoa! Behind!

13:29.417 --> 13:31.118
- Behind you! Behind!
- Behind! Behind!

13:31.152 --> 13:33.153
- Oh, so you...
- Behind!

13:33.187 --> 13:34.621
- Behind!
- Whoa!

13:34.656 --> 13:36.023
Behind. In front.

13:36.057 --> 13:38.325
Behind. What's this?

13:42.096 --> 13:43.497
It's Jess!

13:43.531 --> 13:44.798
- Oh, my God.
- I mean, it's Jess! Hey!

13:44.832 --> 13:46.466
What's up, girl? What you...

13:46.501 --> 13:47.868
- doing home?
- I'm great. I'm great.

13:47.902 --> 13:49.736
Hide the cake.
Hide the...

13:49.771 --> 13:51.038
- I'm great.
- Behind.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.840
How's your day going?

13:53.875 --> 13:55.208
Going good?

13:55.243 --> 13:58.145
- You're crying?
- Oh.

13:58.179 --> 14:00.147
I'm taking...

14:00.181 --> 14:01.715
- Um...
- I got mine off first.

14:01.749 --> 14:03.350
- No, you didn't.
- Rest up over here.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.352
What a day, guys.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.853
- Really long, huh?
- Yeah.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.021
Bet you had a
long day, huh?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.356
I'm really fine.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.291
It had a real day, you know.

14:12.827 --> 14:14.828
I'm disappointed in Nick.

14:14.862 --> 14:16.471
Yeah, you got to let that out,
you know, 'cause...

14:16.522 --> 14:17.373
But I'm disappointed

14:17.431 --> 14:19.900
in myself because I'm
disappointed in Nick, you know.

14:19.934 --> 14:21.301
Oh, I feel you.

14:21.336 --> 14:22.669
Yeah, that's messed up.

14:22.704 --> 14:25.005
- Yeah, let it out. Let it out.
- I'm getting up.

14:25.039 --> 14:26.440
- Oh...! Jess...
- No, no, no...

14:26.474 --> 14:29.943
Hey. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

14:29.978 --> 14:32.212
Want you to close your
eyes, breathe deep,

14:32.246 --> 14:34.948
and go to the most
magical place on earth--

14:34.983 --> 14:36.617
your imagination.

14:36.651 --> 14:38.752
Have you guys been baking?

14:38.786 --> 14:40.454
Ah, nah.
Bakery downtown exploded.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.255
Don't look into it.
It's not on the Internet.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.357
Yeah. She is here.

14:43.391 --> 14:46.193
What happened?

14:46.227 --> 14:49.062
She doesn't think I can do
anything or plan anything,

14:49.097 --> 14:51.064
and it feels like crap.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.432
Maybe she's right.

14:52.467 --> 14:54.267
Why did I think
I could pull this off?

14:54.302 --> 14:56.403
I'm pretty sure
I'm having a heart attack.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.871
And I haven't arranged

14:57.905 --> 15:00.207
for anybody
to clear my Internet history.

15:00.241 --> 15:01.975
I wasn't building a bomb!

15:02.010 --> 15:03.810
I was just curious.

15:03.845 --> 15:06.046
Nick, you got a whole team of
friends pulling for you, okay?

15:06.080 --> 15:08.448
Just get yourself home.
You can still pull this off.

15:09.784 --> 15:10.884
Hey, Mike.

15:10.918 --> 15:12.886
-What?
- So I cleaned out the beer trap,

15:12.920 --> 15:14.554
I polished all these
wine glasses,

15:14.589 --> 15:16.456
and I turned that
penis graffiti in the bathroom

15:16.491 --> 15:18.291
into a whimsical hat.

15:18.326 --> 15:21.628
Now my friend and I
have to go to a party.

15:21.663 --> 15:23.897
All right, Schmidt,
let's go.

15:23.931 --> 15:25.565
You called me your friend.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.800
Did I?

15:26.834 --> 15:28.168
And now, look,

15:28.202 --> 15:30.237
no matter what we see in here,
I just want you to know that

15:30.271 --> 15:32.139
it's been an honor
working with you.

15:32.173 --> 15:34.174
You, too, man.

15:40.715 --> 15:41.915
Oh...

15:41.949 --> 15:44.217
Wow, look at that.

15:48.189 --> 15:49.389
Oh, my God.

15:50.958 --> 15:52.959
Oh, man.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.461
Our, uh...

15:54.495 --> 15:56.430
cakes merged.

15:56.464 --> 15:57.998
Looks as if they have.
Yeah.

15:59.867 --> 16:03.003
Well...

16:03.037 --> 16:04.438
- Hey!
- Aah!

16:04.472 --> 16:05.472
- Ah.
- Ah.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.640
Team check-in. Where we at?

16:06.674 --> 16:08.775
Our cake became double cake.

16:08.810 --> 16:09.876
Yeah. Two cakes.

16:09.911 --> 16:11.878
Yeah.

16:11.913 --> 16:13.213
Two cakes became one?

16:13.247 --> 16:14.314
- Two cakes, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.682
Fantastic, I'll go get Jess.

16:15.717 --> 16:16.316
- Cool.
- Nice.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.218
Hey, Jess.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.021
Hey, guys!

16:23.424 --> 16:24.825
What's up, man?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.326
She's at the movies.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.361
This might actually work.

16:28.396 --> 16:29.863
- At the what...?
- Come on!

16:32.223 --> 16:34.057
More, more.

16:34.092 --> 16:35.492
More.

16:35.526 --> 16:36.526
Uh...

16:36.561 --> 16:37.728
and, okay.

16:37.762 --> 16:38.962
I think we're good.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.264
Same to the second one.

16:47.705 --> 16:49.840
Hey, Jess, it's, uh, Nick.

16:49.874 --> 16:51.875
You obviously knew that.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.811
Um, I know this is where you
always go on your birthday

16:54.846 --> 16:56.380
to be by yourself,

16:56.414 --> 16:59.049
but I thought this year you
might want a little company.

16:59.083 --> 17:00.317
Mind if I sit?

17:01.786 --> 17:02.786
Look under the seat.

17:04.955 --> 17:07.190
Now please read
the card, I'll wait.

17:07.224 --> 17:08.755
How did you know
I was gonna be sitting here?

17:08.925 --> 17:09.986
I put one under every seat,

17:10.096 --> 17:11.895
- but you got to go fast, 'cause
of the timing. - Okay.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.064
"My name is Jess,
I like to wear tights.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.767
It's dark in this room,
so let's turn on the lights."

17:16.800 --> 17:19.403
Surprise!

17:19.436 --> 17:20.569
Whoo!

17:20.605 --> 17:23.540
That's enough.
Timing, guys, timing.

17:29.614 --> 17:31.448
In the beginning, there was nothing,

17:31.482 --> 17:32.849
and then there was light
and dark

17:32.884 --> 17:34.384
and oceans and birds
and stuff...

17:34.419 --> 17:36.787
and then there was Jess!

17:36.821 --> 17:39.656
Nick? This was
the plan all along?

17:43.795 --> 17:45.629
What do I think of
when I think of Jess?

17:45.663 --> 17:48.298
When I think of Jess.
Okay...

17:48.333 --> 17:50.200
When I think about Jess...

17:50.234 --> 17:53.570
I think of how sweet she is
and how smart she is.

17:53.604 --> 17:56.974
...uh, is glasses
and the hair thing.

17:57.008 --> 17:59.309
...think of dance parties
and sleepovers...

17:59.344 --> 18:01.611
Jess does not like
being tackled.

18:01.646 --> 18:04.314
The eyes, two eyes.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.316
Happy birthday, Ms. Day.

18:06.351 --> 18:10.654
Your youthful exuberance...

18:10.688 --> 18:12.422
exhausts me.

18:12.457 --> 18:14.758
May it fade
with each passing year.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.159
Well, she made me try papayas.

18:16.194 --> 18:17.594
That was cool.

18:17.628 --> 18:19.162
They're super soft inside.

18:19.197 --> 18:21.665
Jess is the upstairs lady.

18:21.699 --> 18:23.500
There is a... there is a ma...

18:26.471 --> 18:28.772
You make mistakes.

18:28.806 --> 18:31.775
Happy birthday
to my best work friend.

18:31.809 --> 18:33.677
Tina, if you see this,
I'm sorry.

18:33.711 --> 18:35.312
I just feel like
we drifted apart

18:35.346 --> 18:37.481
after Jeremy's cocaine thing.

18:37.515 --> 18:39.349
It was awkward.

18:39.384 --> 18:42.352
"When the stirrups of life
start to feel like the speculum

18:42.387 --> 18:44.021
of old age..." Nick,
I'm not reading this.

18:45.456 --> 18:46.656
Happy birtay, Jess.

18:46.691 --> 18:48.358
Your boyfriend
is sweet and simple

18:48.393 --> 18:50.327
and will not get out
of my waiting room.

18:51.195 --> 18:52.429
I saw a squirrel once.

18:52.463 --> 18:53.663
It looked like Jess.

18:53.698 --> 18:55.699
Then it attacked my sister,

18:55.733 --> 18:57.834
So I had to beat it
with a stick,

18:57.869 --> 19:00.437
and then it didn't
look like Jess anymore.

19:00.471 --> 19:02.506
Happy birthday.
It's Bearclaw.

Happy birthday, Ms. Day.

19:13.351 --> 19:15.118
Yay!

19:15.153 --> 19:17.521
What I remember

19:17.555 --> 19:18.955
most of all is the pain.

19:18.990 --> 19:22.025
Honestly, it was 36 hours--

19:22.060 --> 19:25.829
more than that--
of just searing, ripping, and then...

19:30.368 --> 19:33.503
Out you came,
the most beautiful,

19:33.538 --> 19:36.907
beautiful little baby
I ever saw in my life.

19:36.941 --> 19:38.241
And I forgot all the pain.

19:38.276 --> 19:40.143
When you were born, I got a deli
sandwich

19:40.178 --> 19:41.912
at the hospital cafeteria.

19:41.946 --> 19:45.082
And then there was a baby.

19:45.116 --> 19:48.418
Happy birthday to my oldest
and my best friend.

19:48.453 --> 19:49.853
Happy birthday, Ms. Day.

19:49.887 --> 19:50.821

Happy, happy birthday.

20:00.531 --> 20:03.066
You have a cool boyfriend.

20:03.101 --> 20:05.335
This is the coin I had in my pocket

20:05.369 --> 20:06.636
the first night we kissed.

20:07.638 --> 20:08.939
And I always have it.

Hey, Jess, I'm so sorry.

20:36.501 --> 20:39.302
That was cheesy, embarrassing.

20:39.337 --> 20:41.071
I didn't have
great talent to work with.

20:41.105 --> 20:42.506
Winston was terrible.

Ashamed of yourself.

- Boo.
- No!
