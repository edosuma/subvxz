WEBVTT

00:06.667 --> 00:08.000
Your dad's out.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.184
Busted out with Hate 'Em All
this afternoon.

00:09.208 --> 00:10.750
He's broken out to get the gold.

00:10.833 --> 00:12.559
Get him off the street.
Just get him off the street.

00:12.583 --> 00:14.333
They've blow-piped us, Hate 'Em.

00:14.375 --> 00:17.042
Well, well, well, look what
the pussycat dragged in.

00:17.125 --> 00:18.999
You'll get nothing from me!

00:19.000 --> 00:20.434
Do you think your friend
Albert Hill

00:20.458 --> 00:21.684
would take the same
punishment for you?

00:21.708 --> 00:24.166
- I do.
- Nas Stone is coming to London.

00:24.167 --> 00:25.500
We're happy about this why?

00:25.583 --> 00:27.167
He wants the rest
of the gold, Albert.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.667
He says he'll take all of it.

00:29.917 --> 00:30.958
Vic?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.167
Bob?

00:32.208 --> 00:34.292
You don't know, do you?

00:35.500 --> 00:36.958
Know what?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.042
Yeah, Bobby Adams' gang.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.750
I knew it. I bloody knew it!

00:42.792 --> 00:45.375
When I bought this place
off Jonesy five years back,

00:45.417 --> 00:47.000
he said, "Tommy,
I've had some dealings"

00:47.042 --> 00:48.542
with a bit of a naughty crew."

00:48.583 --> 00:50.375
"Nasty types," he says.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.666
Used to come down here
for all manner of mischief.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.583
Last year, they
buggered off to Spain.

00:54.667 --> 00:57.833
Let the heat die down
after something big.

00:57.875 --> 01:00.458
Here you go.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:10.292 --> 01:13.333
Yeah. Yeah, it fits the intel.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.708
Yeah, you did the right thing,
calling this in.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.000
Truth is, I did some homework.

01:18.042 --> 01:21.417
It says, "If no claim is made to
articles found at the property",

01:21.458 --> 01:23.750
ownership rights refer
to the landowner."

01:23.792 --> 01:25.542
- That's me, right?
- Yeah.

01:25.583 --> 01:29.208
That is you indeed, sir.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.083
Give us a hand to bring it up,
will you?

01:31.167 --> 01:32.208
Yeah, all right.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.167
Sir... I found something I think
you should take a look at.

02:27.333 --> 02:28.792
Mornin', pal.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.625
Bit chilly last night?

02:31.667 --> 02:33.500
The shelter's just opened
on Dexter Street.

02:33.583 --> 02:35.833
Weren't much of a queue there
when I went past.

02:37.125 --> 02:38.417
Get a bit of breakfast...

02:38.458 --> 02:40.458
and a shower before
the rush starts.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.542
Here...

02:43.583 --> 02:45.083
Get yourself a bacon roll
and cuppa

02:45.125 --> 02:46.565
before you go back
on the hard stuff.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.000
Don't you know who I am?

02:54.333 --> 02:56.333
I'm Vic Hill!

02:56.375 --> 02:58.832
This... is my manor.

02:58.833 --> 03:01.542
And this... is my rubbish.

03:01.625 --> 03:02.833
So piss off.

03:14.958 --> 03:16.666
No sign of him.

03:16.667 --> 03:19.500
Well... well, you just
get back out there, Albert,

03:19.542 --> 03:20.958
and keep looking for him.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.143
Look, I been traipsing
around the neighborhood

03:22.167 --> 03:23.542
looking for him all night, okay?

03:23.583 --> 03:25.393
I got my own shit to deal with.
He's a big boy.

03:25.417 --> 03:26.893
I'm not gonna follow him around
with a mop anymore, all right?

03:26.917 --> 03:28.393
No, that's not okay...
Your father is out there

03:28.417 --> 03:30.542
on the street, on his own,
and he's not safe!

03:30.583 --> 03:31.976
Okay, well, let's say I do
manage to track him down.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.875
Then what, you want me
to dart him again?

03:33.917 --> 03:35.309
Maybe this time
I'll run him over with the van.

03:35.333 --> 03:36.667
Have you considered, just once,

03:36.708 --> 03:38.143
that Dad is not the bloke
you think he is?

03:38.167 --> 03:39.851
He's a selfish prick
that doesn't give a fuck

03:39.875 --> 03:41.333
about either one of us!

03:42.542 --> 03:44.000
Don't worry about it.

03:44.042 --> 03:46.333
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.833
Albert...

04:01.167 --> 04:03.542
Scooter.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.625
If I ever get out of here,

04:08.667 --> 04:10.458
I'm gonna make a few changes.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.542
I'm gonna be more dependable.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.332
You talking to the fairies,
Charlie?

04:18.333 --> 04:19.333
Piss off!

04:20.666 --> 04:23.166
Look here.

04:23.167 --> 04:25.333
There's no need for
that kind of hostility.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.458
This is a good time
of your own making.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.625
I fail to see
how being snatched,

04:29.667 --> 04:31.832
chained up, and beaten
by a delusional psychopath

04:31.833 --> 04:33.333
is anyone's idea of a good time.

04:33.417 --> 04:34.750
What you need to do is point me

04:34.792 --> 04:37.250
in the direction
of my heart's desire.

04:37.292 --> 04:39.499
If your information bears fruit,

04:39.500 --> 04:41.125
I'll release you
from these shackles

04:41.167 --> 04:44.625
and furnish on you a finder's
fee of, let's say...

04:44.667 --> 04:46.542
ten percent?

04:46.583 --> 04:49.500
You can propel your finders fee
where the sun don't shine.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.625
Looks like I'm gonna
have to give you

04:53.667 --> 04:55.625
a professional kicking
this time.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.875
Yeah.

04:58.917 --> 05:01.833
But first... breakfast!

05:07.208 --> 05:08.792
Don't get any bright ideas.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.167
I'll be back in two shakes

05:11.208 --> 05:13.333
of a lamb's tail.

05:18.167 --> 05:21.832
Nas is in a taxi
on the way from the airport.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.625
He's here in London, Albert.

05:23.667 --> 05:24.917
Good, so where's the meet?

05:24.958 --> 05:26.375
Well, I can't
take him to Saul's,

05:26.417 --> 05:28.042
so I'm meeting him
in the market.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.500
He'll be here in 20 minutes.

05:29.542 --> 05:30.500
I'm on my way.

05:30.542 --> 05:31.750
Okay.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.458
Come on, big guy,
pick up... pick up.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.500
Hate 'Em, where the hell
have you been?

05:39.833 --> 05:41.042
You match fit?

05:45.333 --> 05:47.083
Vic, now, I'm a little bit
confused here.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.000
What exactly happened?

05:50.292 --> 05:52.875
We got darted, Hate 'Em.

05:52.958 --> 05:56.332
Like wild animals
on the savannah.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.792
They wanted us
out of the picture.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.166
Who wanted us out
of the picture?

05:59.167 --> 06:00.292
Albert, Lily.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.333
Albert and Lily?

06:01.417 --> 06:02.833
Don't be stupid.

06:02.917 --> 06:04.167
Well, it appears

06:04.250 --> 06:05.476
I have indeed
been stupid, Hate 'Em.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.042
Very stupid indeed.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.292
They got used to me
not being around,

06:09.333 --> 06:11.417
Lily all cozied up with Norman,

06:11.458 --> 06:13.958
and Albert wanting
to be top dog.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.083
And... I reckon
they have the gold, Hate 'Em.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.917
Or at least had it.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.832
But I can't prove it.

06:22.833 --> 06:26.583
I don't have all the pieces
of the jigsaw... yet.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.832
So what you're saying now, Vic,
is that we're actually

06:30.833 --> 06:33.667
hunting jigsaw pieces, yeah?

06:35.500 --> 06:37.833
Metaphorically speaking.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.666
So... seeing as how

06:41.667 --> 06:44.250
I can't go after my own son,

06:44.292 --> 06:47.292
we're gonna start with
the weakest link.

06:47.333 --> 06:50.917
An old pal of Albert's.

06:50.958 --> 06:53.333
So, you tidy yourself up.

06:53.375 --> 06:56.375
We're gonna pay a visit
to the upper crust.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.958
I'll make you right, Vic.

07:33.042 --> 07:34.667
Norman.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.375
I just don't get it.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.792
Chair's not broken,
rope's not cut.

07:41.833 --> 07:44.292
Someone must have untied him.
Come off it, Lil.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.708
We tied him to a chair
and locked him in a garden shed.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.666
The man had just broken out
of a high-security prison.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.958
Honestly, I don't know
what we were thinking.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.999
I know, all I'm saying is...

07:55.000 --> 07:56.500
if he'd done it himself,

07:56.542 --> 07:59.042
the chair would be broke
and the rope would be cut.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.750
What does it matter
how he got free, Lily?

08:01.792 --> 08:03.250
Well, he's gone now.

08:03.292 --> 08:05.333
Got only knows where he is.

08:05.417 --> 08:07.083
I will not
have my family estranged

08:07.125 --> 08:09.458
for another 15 years, Norman.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.750
So where is he?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.208
He's not here yet.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.667
Strike that!

08:31.917 --> 08:33.750
He's not too subtle, your mate.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.792
What? Yo! Yo! That's my wallet!

08:43.832 --> 08:46.500
- Whoa.
- Yo! Hey! Hey!

08:53.917 --> 08:55.125
Welcome to London.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.125
I am so sorry, Nas.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.375
Sorry? For what?

08:59.417 --> 09:03.042
First foot on the ground and I'm
into some Oliver Twist shit.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.125
I love this town!

09:05.167 --> 09:06.833
Lovely, shall we
get going, then?

09:06.875 --> 09:08.542
No, business can wait.

09:08.583 --> 09:12.042
Ain't every day I get to visit
my favorite metropolis.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.250
I gotta soak it up.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.042
Hey, man! Yo!

09:15.083 --> 09:16.500
Hey.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.125
Hyuh!

09:39.292 --> 09:41.042
Charlie's residence.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.750
Are you shitting me?

09:50.750 --> 09:52.167
I shit you not.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.166
Check upstairs, mate.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.625
Sweet.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.166
En garde, you cad.

10:13.167 --> 10:16.042
Fah fah fah fah fah fah
fah fah fah fah fah fah fah.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.958
- What's that?
- Music.

10:56.417 --> 10:59.083
Drop the iron and put
your hands where I can see 'em.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.792
Slowly does it.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.917
You're going to be disappointed.

11:08.958 --> 11:11.417
The family coffers
were emptied long ago.

11:11.458 --> 11:13.750
Bequeathed
to various pawnbrokers

11:13.833 --> 11:16.917
by an esteemed line
of forebears.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.375
We're not here
for the silverware, mate.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.542
Then I'm not entirely sure
how I can help you.

11:24.625 --> 11:27.625
I can assure you that
no one will pay my ransom.

11:28.833 --> 11:31.000
Get over here.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.458
You talk too much.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.333
Stay down. Stay!

11:37.583 --> 11:40.375
Now...

11:40.417 --> 11:44.250
where is Charles?

11:44.292 --> 11:47.833
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss the whereabouts

11:47.875 --> 11:49.458
of my employers.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.917
I was actually hoping
you'd say that.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.500
Now, where is he?!

11:58.583 --> 12:00.041
Ripe!

12:00.042 --> 12:02.500
Dried fruit!

12:02.542 --> 12:03.875
A challenging nose.

12:03.958 --> 12:05.999
Make yourself comfortable, Vic.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.458
I think this is gonna
take a while.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.458
Stay still! Where is he?

12:12.500 --> 12:13.500
Tell me.

12:13.583 --> 12:16.167
Where is he? Where is he?

12:17.250 --> 12:19.583
Stop it! Where is he?

12:20.750 --> 12:22.583
Where is he? Where is he?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.958
You hit like a girl, sir.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.667
Bob, what you fail
to understand is

12:35.708 --> 12:37.375
I may well be a girl...

12:37.417 --> 12:39.875
but I'm the meanest girl
on the playground.

12:41.208 --> 12:43.833
And you, heh...
you, you naughty boy.

12:43.875 --> 12:45.166
You've been running round
my playground

12:45.167 --> 12:46.958
causing quite a mess.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.125
Agh.

12:50.792 --> 12:54.083
Where is it?
Where's the gold, Bob?

12:55.125 --> 12:56.583
Teri...

12:56.625 --> 12:57.750
did you know...

12:57.792 --> 12:59.792
Did I know what, Bob?

12:59.833 --> 13:02.292
Did you know...

13:02.333 --> 13:05.417
you can never lose
a homing pigeon?

13:07.083 --> 13:09.875
If your homing pigeon
doesn't come back,

13:09.917 --> 13:11.917
what you've lost...

13:11.958 --> 13:14.625
is a pigeon.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.167
If I so much as hear
your name whispered

13:19.208 --> 13:22.000
in relation to this case again,

13:22.042 --> 13:24.333
I'll find you,
and I will put an end

13:24.375 --> 13:27.332
to the quip that is Bob Fink.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.667
Understood. Sir.

13:36.458 --> 13:37.500
Sling him out.

13:38.583 --> 13:39.958
Aaaah!

13:44.708 --> 13:46.750
Ha ha! Yeah!

13:46.792 --> 13:50.042
This is some authenticated
Brit shit right here!

13:50.083 --> 13:51.083
Ha ha!

13:54.542 --> 13:56.250
Is he taking us
for a ride or what?

13:56.292 --> 13:58.101
Let him get some new duds.
He'll feel a million bucks,

13:58.125 --> 13:59.625
and we'll take him
to Uncle Dean's.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.059
I wanna know what
a million bucks feels like.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.750
You will. Be patient.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.167
Jimmy, Nas Stone.
Nas, Jimmy the Chalk.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.792
Who the what?

14:11.833 --> 14:15.625
What sort of getup
does sir want to be fitted?

14:15.667 --> 14:16.832
Help me out here, brother.

14:16.833 --> 14:18.083
What kind of suit do you want?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.792
Three-button hunting jacket

14:22.833 --> 14:24.125
in an over-check twill tweed,

14:24.167 --> 14:25.434
bold pattern
with the vest and the...

14:25.458 --> 14:27.750
Matching plus fours, sir?

14:27.792 --> 14:30.417
My man!

15:01.500 --> 15:03.958
So, how long is this shit

15:04.000 --> 15:05.500
gonna take to stitch up, Jimmy?

15:05.583 --> 15:07.792
Um... two days, sir.

15:07.833 --> 15:10.667
Two hours, you said?

15:12.083 --> 15:14.042
Two hours, sir.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.333
You're making more friends,
I see, Bob.

15:24.375 --> 15:26.000
You're a curious one, Charlie.

15:27.375 --> 15:28.875
Born into a family of note.

15:28.917 --> 15:31.667
With all the opportunities
that blue blood

15:31.708 --> 15:34.999
coursing through your veins
offers a young man.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.792
Yet you... you choose
to knock about

15:38.833 --> 15:41.083
with a gangster's kid.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.333
And an orphan.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.875
Seems to me you're punching
under your weight, mate.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.042
You haven't got an inkling

15:53.083 --> 15:55.875
of who I am
or what I want to be.

15:55.917 --> 15:58.250
You see, that's
where you're wrong.

15:58.292 --> 16:01.583
I see you very clearly.

16:01.625 --> 16:05.875
'Cause I used to be
walking in your shoes.

16:05.917 --> 16:09.750
Yeah... I, like you,
was seduced by the Hill family.

16:09.833 --> 16:12.875
Extending myself
for crumbs of acceptance.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.832
Wanting to be a part
of the inner circle,

16:14.833 --> 16:19.332
longing, long for a firm
pat on the back.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.917
But let me tell you
from experience,

16:21.958 --> 16:25.833
the simple,
"Well done, Charlie"...

16:25.917 --> 16:28.625
it'll never come.

16:28.667 --> 16:32.625
You're not a Hill.
You never will be.

16:32.667 --> 16:35.792
To Albert, you're just
a posh twat...

16:35.833 --> 16:37.750
who's there to be used
and tossed aside

16:37.792 --> 16:39.333
when your novelty wears thin.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.667
Albert is my friend.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.708
No.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.833
I am your friend.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.542
And I need you
to accept me as such.

16:46.583 --> 16:49.833
Or I will presuppose
you're my enemy.

16:54.917 --> 16:58.625
And if you're my enemy...

16:58.667 --> 17:01.000
well...

17:01.042 --> 17:02.875
Don't you touch me!

17:06.000 --> 17:07.916
What's got into you, Scooter?

17:07.958 --> 17:12.291
What's got into you, boy?

17:12.333 --> 17:15.208
So our guest's been
flirting with you, has he?

17:16.750 --> 17:19.625
Course... breakfast, buddy.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.125
It slipped my mind.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.500
Aaagh!

17:30.542 --> 17:32.917
Dog food, Bob!

17:33.000 --> 17:34.750
Dog food, Bob!

17:40.000 --> 17:42.375
Bloody psycho.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.708
Not intruding, am I?

18:14.750 --> 18:16.499
It's your house, Norman.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.625
It's us who's intruding.

18:18.667 --> 18:21.625
Lily, you are always
welcome in this house.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.417
What is it, Norman?

18:28.458 --> 18:31.167
Christ.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.250
I...

18:33.292 --> 18:35.917
I did it for you, Lily.

18:35.958 --> 18:37.250
You and Albert.

18:37.292 --> 18:39.875
What precisely
have you done, Norman?

18:42.583 --> 18:44.083
It was me, Lily.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.750
I untied him, I let Vic go.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.333
Why would you do that?

18:48.375 --> 18:51.292
Lily, you've got to realize
I did this for you.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.250
I couldn't just stand by him,

18:53.333 --> 18:56.208
witness him tear
his family apart, again.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.375
I... I see how he treats you,

18:58.417 --> 19:00.625
what he expects of you,
and I'm meant to just

19:00.667 --> 19:05.042
sit back and watch you,
the most exquisite flower,

19:05.125 --> 19:08.375
wilting with neglect,
poisoned by his selfishness!

19:08.458 --> 19:10.292
Stop, Norm. Just stop it.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.999
The gold is more important
to him than his family.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.083
It always has been,
but you must realize...

19:14.125 --> 19:15.559
- Just... just stop it!
- I... I would never treat you...

19:15.583 --> 19:16.583
All right? Just stop.

19:18.292 --> 19:20.542
Now, I'm gonna have to make this
absolutely clear.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.375
For you, me, Vic, and Albert,

19:24.417 --> 19:26.583
there can't be any confusion.

19:29.250 --> 19:33.417
Vic is my husband,
and I love him unconditionally.

19:33.458 --> 19:38.332
I always have,
and I always will.

19:38.333 --> 19:42.832
Irrespective of what you
might see or think you see,

19:42.833 --> 19:45.499
I know that he
loves me and Albert

19:45.500 --> 19:47.375
more than anything else
in the world.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.832
I know he doesn't always
do the right thing...

19:51.833 --> 19:54.417
and that's what you see or...

19:54.458 --> 19:57.750
perhaps that's... perhaps
that's what you want to see.

19:57.792 --> 20:00.958
But I know Vic, Norm.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.292
I know Vic Hill
that no one else knows.

20:05.958 --> 20:08.292
And that is the man I love.

20:15.542 --> 20:17.500
So what now, Vic?

20:18.833 --> 20:21.208
A kneecapping
or the Spanish Donkey?

20:21.250 --> 20:23.542
Here, I don't know who you are.

20:23.625 --> 20:27.332
But your methods
of information extraction

20:27.333 --> 20:30.125
are nothing in comparison
to when...

20:30.167 --> 20:33.666
as a young lance corporal
in the Middle East,

20:33.667 --> 20:36.999
I spent an uncomfortable week
as a guest...

20:37.000 --> 20:40.875
I don't have time for wartime
reminiscences, old man.

20:40.917 --> 20:44.792
I'm Vic Hill.
I'm sure you've heard of me.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.583
Who?

20:48.167 --> 20:49.417
Vic Hill?

20:49.458 --> 20:53.000
Yes... Vic Hill.

20:55.792 --> 20:58.583
No, doesn't ring a bell.

20:58.667 --> 21:01.708
Tell me where the boy is at,
or the joke is over.

21:01.750 --> 21:02.750
Capisce?

21:04.167 --> 21:07.375
Mr. Hill, I was brought
into this world

21:07.458 --> 21:09.292
without a home and without kin.

21:09.333 --> 21:12.333
After all manner
of foster homes...

21:12.375 --> 21:15.333
a stint in Borstal and a stretch
with the armed services.

21:15.417 --> 21:18.917
The Cavendish-Scotts,
this, unique family

21:18.958 --> 21:22.000
became my adopted family.
Vic, if you don't iron him out,

21:22.042 --> 21:24.208
I will!

21:24.250 --> 21:27.000
Be careful, you bloody
philistines!

21:28.958 --> 21:31.000
Aha, ha ha.

21:36.458 --> 21:37.750
Fink.

21:42.208 --> 21:43.708
Sir?

21:43.750 --> 21:44.875
Sit down.

21:56.792 --> 21:58.625
What happened to you?

22:00.333 --> 22:03.499
Jurisdictional
disagreement, sir.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.000
Dwyer?

22:07.375 --> 22:09.417
I'm sorry, Fink.

22:10.417 --> 22:11.542
This is...

22:11.583 --> 22:14.500
well, it's partly my fault.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.583
Dwyer was complaining.

22:17.625 --> 22:20.167
Other officers muscling in,
chasing leads

22:20.208 --> 22:22.208
above their station.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.332
I told her to handle it.

22:23.333 --> 22:24.333
Sir, I...

22:24.375 --> 22:26.833
You don't have to explain.

22:26.875 --> 22:28.667
I respect a man with ambition.

22:30.208 --> 22:33.832
We've all had to go a little...
off-piste at times

22:33.833 --> 22:35.125
to get a leg up in our careers.

22:35.167 --> 22:37.625
I wouldn't trust a man
who hadn't.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.500
How can I help, sir?

22:46.625 --> 22:48.208
The Flying Squad...

22:48.250 --> 22:51.167
is no cleaner now
than in the bad old days.

22:51.208 --> 22:54.917
A bunch of venal little bullies,

22:54.958 --> 22:57.750
promoted above their station,
and for what?

22:57.792 --> 23:00.833
Because they're better with
their fists than their brains.

23:00.875 --> 23:04.708
No, no. We need an overhaul.

23:04.750 --> 23:07.875
Root and branch.

23:07.917 --> 23:09.583
New leadership.

23:10.708 --> 23:13.042
These leads of yours,

23:13.125 --> 23:14.458
I don't need details,

23:14.500 --> 23:16.958
just...

23:17.000 --> 23:18.042
if they're admissible.

23:20.625 --> 23:22.666
In this case...

23:22.667 --> 23:25.583
it's career-defining.

23:26.958 --> 23:30.542
If I have anything
that could be of use...

23:30.583 --> 23:32.708
you'll be the first
to know, sir.

23:42.167 --> 23:45.333
There is a better version
of us all out there, Fink.

23:47.167 --> 23:50.000
We just have to want to succeed.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.833
This is some
Prince Charles shit right here!

24:03.917 --> 24:06.750
I should run for King!

24:06.792 --> 24:08.292
Nas, we gotta go.

24:09.667 --> 24:11.250
Bag this shit up, Jimmy.

24:12.292 --> 24:13.667
Bucket list complete!

24:13.708 --> 24:15.083
Finally.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.458
Now... where's my gold?

24:19.500 --> 24:20.958
A gypsy camp.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.792
A what?

24:29.500 --> 24:31.832
The best.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.666
Not this time. I said the best.

24:33.667 --> 24:34.792
I want Windrush.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.332
I already tell you.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.499
Windrush is not here.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.167
And I don't believe you.

24:40.208 --> 24:42.667
Now, I have the folding,
and I have the need.

24:42.750 --> 24:46.999
This ain't some sink-estate
leg-breaker bollocks.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.125
This is gangland history
in the making.

24:50.167 --> 24:52.417
The culmination of over a decade

24:52.458 --> 24:55.167
of bile and bitterness.

24:55.208 --> 24:58.375
This is mythology.

24:58.417 --> 25:03.125
And for that,
I require a legend.

25:03.167 --> 25:07.375
So where is he...
and what's the damage?

25:09.875 --> 25:12.167
You think you
come around here...

25:12.208 --> 25:15.666
and use my boys
for this and that.

25:15.667 --> 25:19.542
You never ask him name,
you never shake him hand.

25:19.625 --> 25:23.500
Always you... sneering.

25:23.542 --> 25:27.750
You... flashin' your money.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.500
But you not look men.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.167
You look meat!

25:35.042 --> 25:38.583
But let me tell you
one thing 'bout Windrush.

25:38.625 --> 25:43.542
Him not ask question,
and him not judge nothin'.

25:43.583 --> 25:47.500
But Windrush ain't meat.

25:50.417 --> 25:53.167
All him ask... all him expect

25:53.208 --> 25:55.875
from any boss wanting
the kind of reputation

25:55.917 --> 25:57.542
what you mention...

25:57.625 --> 25:59.542
is a little respect.

26:11.792 --> 26:14.208
Windrush is not here.

26:29.583 --> 26:31.417
Stop!

26:31.500 --> 26:33.667
Not that one, please.

26:33.708 --> 26:35.500
It's the only pressing.

26:35.542 --> 26:38.832
It's all I've got left
of my childhood.

26:38.833 --> 26:41.375
My.

26:41.458 --> 26:43.999
This is you,
your five minutes of fame.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.667
Your X-Factor moment as a cadet.

26:46.708 --> 26:50.999
Alas, "please" isn't amongst
the magic words I'm after.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.332
Bastards.

26:53.333 --> 26:56.250
I don't believe that's
the magic word, either.

26:56.292 --> 26:58.083
The problem with these old 78s

26:58.125 --> 26:59.833
is they're made of shellac.

26:59.875 --> 27:04.417
They shatter like glass.

27:04.458 --> 27:07.917
I drove him back from
the country estate yesterday!

27:07.958 --> 27:10.083
He was more than
a little under the influence.

27:10.125 --> 27:13.250
Blathering on about a...
A golden bathtub!

27:13.333 --> 27:15.332
Complete gibberish!

27:15.333 --> 27:18.499
Golden bathtub?

27:18.500 --> 27:22.042
No, no! And... and something
about gypsies and smelting...

27:22.125 --> 27:23.875
- Gypsies?
- And a girl named Chloe!

27:23.958 --> 27:25.000
Get his car keys.

27:26.292 --> 27:27.500
Give us your car keys.

27:27.542 --> 27:29.125
Give us your car keys.

27:30.125 --> 27:31.125
Prick.

27:31.167 --> 27:32.667
Right...

27:32.750 --> 27:35.000
Got his car keys, Vic.
Where to now?

27:35.083 --> 27:36.500
The Pikeys.

27:39.083 --> 27:41.625
Pikeys. I hate Pikeys.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.833
What the hell is this?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.625
All part of the anglo-rural
experience, Nas.

28:04.958 --> 28:07.667
How are your 5p specials
holding up?

28:07.708 --> 28:10.166
I ain't into
getting shit on my shit.

28:10.167 --> 28:12.792
Shall we get to the business
at hand, gentlemen?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.917
Who're these bastards then?

28:31.958 --> 28:33.875
This is Nas Stone, Uncle Dean.

28:33.917 --> 28:37.333
And what is a Nas Stone then?

28:39.333 --> 28:40.832
I'm a Nas Stone.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.167
What the hell are you?

28:42.208 --> 28:47.208
I am an Uncle Dean, pal.

28:49.167 --> 28:50.667
Jesus, look at
the size of this one.

28:50.708 --> 28:52.499
Aye, man, look at the trousers
hangin' off his ass.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.292
Hey... anything for a favor.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.750
I'd kill you for a tenner.

28:55.792 --> 28:58.333
Nas is our buyer, Uncle Dean.

28:58.417 --> 29:00.167
So that's not stolen then?

29:03.417 --> 29:04.708
No, it ain't stolen!

29:04.750 --> 29:06.958
Hey, get them off my ride!

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Rich yank fella in my camp.
Thought I'd seen it all.

29:10.042 --> 29:12.875
So you'll be wanting
your gold, yank?

29:19.750 --> 29:22.250
Or... do you want
to buy a caravan?

29:26.667 --> 29:29.708
Do I look like I'm here
to buy a caravan?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.625
Fresh out the oven.

29:40.167 --> 29:41.333
Horseshoes?

29:41.417 --> 29:43.125
Lucky horseshoes.

29:43.167 --> 29:46.875
It's one way to try
and cancel a curse.

29:46.917 --> 29:48.375
Hold up.

29:48.417 --> 29:49.500
What curse?

29:49.542 --> 29:51.125
Didn't you tell him?

29:51.167 --> 29:54.083
This is deadlier than
a banshee's wail, this pile.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.059
Killed more baddies than
Clint Eastwood, so it has.

29:56.083 --> 29:58.792
Makes Tutankhamen
look like a fairy gobshite.

29:58.833 --> 30:00.875
You'll probably be fine.

30:00.917 --> 30:02.332
They're poking fun.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.875
It's a cultural sign
of affection, Nas.

30:06.333 --> 30:09.292
So you happy with the inventory?

30:09.333 --> 30:10.500
It's all there, as promised.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.458
Let's weigh the shit.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.667
We got scales
in the trunk of the limo.

30:28.958 --> 30:33.083
A sickness of the heart
that only gold can cure.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.226
I thought England
was all Corgis,

30:43.250 --> 30:45.417
Spice Girls, tea and crumpets.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.750
This is some off-the-tour-guide
"Deliverance" shit.

30:47.833 --> 30:49.167
We'll complete the transaction

30:49.208 --> 30:50.434
and get you out of here
as soon as possible.

30:50.458 --> 30:52.292
God damn it! God...

30:52.333 --> 30:53.500
Get off my ride!

31:06.042 --> 31:07.333
Y'all crazy!

31:07.375 --> 31:10.208
Off-the-charts, God damn
fuckin' crazy!

31:25.167 --> 31:26.333
Eeeny, meanie...

31:28.708 --> 31:29.708
miney...

31:31.833 --> 31:32.833
mo.

31:47.833 --> 31:49.917
Whoa...

31:53.333 --> 31:54.333
Aah!

31:55.375 --> 31:56.333
Shit.

31:56.375 --> 31:57.542
What was that?

31:57.583 --> 31:58.542
Where's the gold?

31:58.583 --> 31:59.625
It's in the wheelbarrow.

32:11.917 --> 32:13.167
Fink.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.333
Sh...

32:25.167 --> 32:26.666
Who's this son of a bitch?!

32:26.667 --> 32:29.792
Sure looks like a bastard
copper to me!

32:29.833 --> 32:30.833
Aaah!

32:55.875 --> 32:57.292
Aaaaah!

33:08.000 --> 33:09.667
Aah!!

33:16.042 --> 33:18.792
Tall Paul! Tall Paul!

33:22.917 --> 33:23.917
Agh!

33:31.167 --> 33:33.499
I ain't going out like this.

33:33.500 --> 33:37.000
Not here... now now!

33:37.042 --> 33:38.625
You know who I am?

33:38.667 --> 33:40.333
I designed
the diamond Brooklyn B!

33:40.375 --> 33:42.333
The triple-weave gold dog rope!

33:44.208 --> 33:46.833
I got my shit
placed at Tiffany's!

33:49.167 --> 33:51.250
I got more followers on Insta...

33:51.292 --> 33:54.125
than all you joke shop
sons of bitches.

33:55.208 --> 33:57.292
I am Nas Stone!

33:57.333 --> 33:59.875
Jeweler to the stars!

33:59.917 --> 34:01.167
And I was born...

34:01.208 --> 34:02.458
Shut your mother...

34:02.500 --> 34:03.958
a motherfuckin'...

34:04.000 --> 34:06.542
Grenade! Hey, black man!

34:06.583 --> 34:07.583
Splash!

34:15.000 --> 34:17.667
Sure you can't kill me!
I'm Un...

34:22.875 --> 34:25.167
Jeez!

34:30.500 --> 34:32.292
Give the the Hill kid a sendoff.

34:43.958 --> 34:47.083
Didn't your mummy tell you
not to play with guns?

34:52.333 --> 34:54.500
Right.
Let's go and get our gold.

34:58.167 --> 35:03.125
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no...

35:31.167 --> 35:33.167
Albert?

35:34.208 --> 35:35.499
Albert!

35:35.500 --> 35:37.999
What happened?
What happened here?!

35:38.000 --> 35:40.875
What do you mean,
what happened here?

35:40.917 --> 35:43.375
Look around you.
Everyone's dead.

35:43.458 --> 35:45.167
Dead!

35:45.208 --> 35:46.875
Where's my gold, boy?

35:46.958 --> 35:48.000
Where's my gold?!

35:53.458 --> 35:54.667
I lost it.

35:56.417 --> 35:57.792
Me.

35:59.667 --> 36:00.875
Bob Fink's got it.

36:03.125 --> 36:04.625
All of it.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.583
Okay, Charlie.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.333
All or nothing.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.833
Come on!

36:36.292 --> 36:37.458
Fuck!

37:26.833 --> 37:30.292
I'm baaack, Charlie boy!

37:34.375 --> 37:35.792
What...

38:19.500 --> 38:20.583
Yes.

38:20.667 --> 38:22.708
Yeees!

38:22.750 --> 38:27.208
Yeeees! Yeees!

38:49.667 --> 38:51.500
Windrush.

38:53.375 --> 38:54.667
Respect.

39:01.667 --> 39:03.833
Best man gets the spoils.

39:15.542 --> 39:18.833
I can't pretend to be
disappointed, Detective.

39:21.833 --> 39:23.500
That would imply, after all,

39:23.583 --> 39:25.625
an expectation of character.

39:27.875 --> 39:29.667
Sir.

39:30.833 --> 39:32.542
Windrush...

39:32.583 --> 39:33.875
Boss.

39:35.208 --> 39:37.333
So he's what?

39:37.375 --> 39:39.833
Undercover?

39:39.875 --> 39:41.542
Windrush is one of yours?

39:41.583 --> 39:43.667
Don't be silly, Bob.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.833
Private hire.

39:47.875 --> 39:49.708
Been on the books for years.

39:49.750 --> 39:51.333
Very valuable asset.

40:01.167 --> 40:03.750
I take it you're here
to arrest me.

40:03.792 --> 40:06.958
You were supposed
to have been killed

40:07.000 --> 40:09.500
in Vic Hill's lockup
15 years ago.

40:11.458 --> 40:13.875
Often how these
big cases go, Bob.

40:13.917 --> 40:16.667
Sometimes you just keep
plotting away

40:16.708 --> 40:19.542
and get there in the end.

40:23.625 --> 40:26.042
You were in on that?

40:26.083 --> 40:28.375
Like I said...

40:28.417 --> 40:30.666
we all have to go
a little off-piste at times

40:30.667 --> 40:32.750
to get a leg up.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.125
Perhaps if you'd focused on

40:44.167 --> 40:45.667
one thing or another,

40:45.750 --> 40:47.833
you might have made
something out of your life.

40:49.958 --> 40:53.250
But all these grudges, these...

40:53.292 --> 40:54.958
seedy little agendas.

41:09.083 --> 41:10.333
Yeah.

41:15.500 --> 41:16.875
Well.
