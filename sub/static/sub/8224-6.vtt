00:00.574 --> 00:03.510
On this episode of "MythBusters"...

00:05.146 --> 00:09.349
Adam and Jamie are taking
silver-screen sounds to task.

00:09.350 --> 00:11.718
We want to see whether these things

00:11.719 --> 00:15.355
make the same sounds in real
life that they do in the movies.

00:15.356 --> 00:16.823
Bye-bye.

00:16.824 --> 00:20.894
Yep, are those audio clichÃ©s fact or fake?

00:20.895 --> 00:22.195
Ka-boom!

00:22.196 --> 00:25.865
Meanwhile, Kari, Grant, and Tory
cast off for science.

00:25.866 --> 00:29.302
This is "blow your own sail"
with the full-size boat.

00:29.303 --> 00:32.405
They're testing the physics
thought experiment

00:32.406 --> 00:35.141
"is it possible to blow your own sail?"

00:35.142 --> 00:36.109
Come on!

00:36.110 --> 00:40.580
Chaos, mayhem, high-sea high jinks ahoy.

00:40.581 --> 00:44.150
I feel like there might be just
a little element of danger here.

00:46.687 --> 00:48.388
Who are the MythBusters?

00:49.390 --> 00:52.458
- Adam Savage...
- I'm done with science for today.

00:52.459 --> 00:55.595
- ...and Jamie Hyneman.
- Way to go there, buddy.

00:55.596 --> 00:59.265
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:00.467 --> 01:02.402
Joining them... Grant Imahara...

01:02.403 --> 01:05.471
It's why we can never have
anything nice.

01:05.471 --> 01:08.241
- ...Tory Belleci...
- I'll try not to let you guys down.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.976
- ...and Kari Byron.
- Whoa!

01:09.977 --> 01:11.778
You know, I went to college for this.

01:11.779 --> 01:13.746
They don't just tell the myths.

01:13.747 --> 01:16.382
They put them to the test.

01:16.407 --> 01:20.107

Sync, corrected by atrn97g - www.addic7ed.com

01:20.193 --> 01:24.496
First up, an audio-myth that
Adam's having nightmares over.

01:26.132 --> 01:27.399
Mm. Look at that.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.769
Somebody's left me a present.

01:30.770 --> 01:32.004
Beautiful. Aah!

01:36.276 --> 01:39.178
Looks like I'm gonna
have to take care of this myself.

01:49.256 --> 01:50.422
Aah!

02:14.447 --> 02:15.447
Bye-bye.

02:23.323 --> 02:24.523
What was that?

02:24.524 --> 02:27.426
- That was our next story.
- Really?

02:27.427 --> 02:30.095
'Cause it looked to me like you
were trying to kill me.

02:30.096 --> 02:31.330
No, no, no, no.

02:31.331 --> 02:32.932
It <i>sounds</i> like I'm trying to kill you.

02:32.933 --> 02:34.166
I don't get it.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.334
Well, our next story

02:35.335 --> 02:37.870
is about whether the sounds
you hear in the movies

02:37.871 --> 02:39.171
are accurate to the real world.

02:39.172 --> 02:42.007
Oh, sounds cool!

02:42.008 --> 02:43.575
Yep, the sounds of Hollywood

02:43.576 --> 02:46.378
are being put under
the MythBusters microscope.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.950
To give a story suspense...

02:50.951 --> 02:53.585
add dramatic punch...

02:53.586 --> 02:56.155
or even a real one...

02:56.156 --> 02:59.758
Movie-makers manipulate,
massage, and enrich

02:59.759 --> 03:02.394
every single sound effect we hear.

03:02.395 --> 03:07.800
But do these audio clichÃ©s bear any
resemblance to the real thing?

03:07.801 --> 03:11.003
To find out, Adam and Jamie
have got their ears...

03:11.004 --> 03:12.771
...for the sound.

03:12.772 --> 03:15.441
All right, so, if memory serves,

03:15.442 --> 03:17.443
the classic movie sound effects
we'll be working with

03:17.444 --> 03:21.213
are things like the punch, the
silencer, and explosions.

03:21.214 --> 03:23.749
- And any others we run into along the way.
- All right.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.784
And the testing seems to be
pretty straightforward.

03:25.785 --> 03:27.753
We punch something, we use a silencer,

03:27.754 --> 03:29.855
we blow something up,
and we record those sounds

03:29.856 --> 03:31.957
and compare them to what the movies

03:31.958 --> 03:34.293
generally represent as those sounds.

03:34.294 --> 03:35.894
Let's start with the punch.

03:35.895 --> 03:37.262
Okay.

03:39.032 --> 03:40.399
Fear not, Adam.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.568
There will be no sobering sequel.

03:45.605 --> 03:49.608
Instead, Jamie's reprising
the "violence of the hams".

03:49.609 --> 03:53.278
I always like to wear rain gear
when I carry around my pigs.

03:53.279 --> 03:55.814
Yep, porky here is stepping up

03:55.815 --> 03:58.550
to take one for the team... again.

03:58.551 --> 04:01.487
And, clearly, Jamie and I are
about to start punching this pig,

04:01.488 --> 04:03.722
but in order to compare
the sound of our punches

04:03.723 --> 04:06.959
to your classic movie punch, we're
going to record it with this...

04:06.960 --> 04:10.629
a directional microphone pointed
exactly at the point of impact.

04:10.630 --> 04:13.632
We will hit the pig,
record it on this mike,

04:13.633 --> 04:16.334
and we will store it on this computer,

04:16.336 --> 04:18.269
where we will compare it to this...

04:18.271 --> 04:21.273
...the sound of a classic movie punch.

04:21.274 --> 04:22.741
Ohh!

04:22.742 --> 04:24.843
Go at him.

04:28.515 --> 04:30.516
Ohh!

04:30.517 --> 04:31.517
Nice!

04:31.518 --> 04:32.918
- Did that hurt?
- A little bit.

04:32.919 --> 04:34.420
I hit my fingers a little wrong.

04:34.421 --> 04:36.989
Considering his hand
was unprotected,

04:36.990 --> 04:41.160
Jamie gave it all he could, but the sound...

04:41.161 --> 04:44.897
wasn't exactly silver-screen superhero.

04:44.898 --> 04:46.632
You want a piece of me?

04:48.034 --> 04:49.868
Aah!

04:49.869 --> 04:52.271
We're gonna get hurt
if we keep doing it like this.

04:52.272 --> 04:53.972
To avoid hurting themselves,

04:53.973 --> 04:55.607
they have to pull their punches,

04:55.608 --> 04:59.311
limiting the power they can put into them.

04:59.312 --> 05:01.814
And the audio recording...
<i>Ohh!</i>

05:01.815 --> 05:04.116
reflects their
less-than-action hero efforts.

05:04.117 --> 05:06.518
<i>Aah!</i>

05:06.519 --> 05:09.588
All right, and for comparison,
here's the movie punch.

05:14.461 --> 05:17.062
There's no... there's
no equivalency at all.

05:17.063 --> 05:18.263
Ohh!

05:18.264 --> 05:21.867
Which leaves the myth
reeling, but not yet knocked out.

05:21.868 --> 05:24.203
Yet another use for duct tape.

05:24.204 --> 05:27.139
Next, they're going to
add a little action-movie oomph

05:27.140 --> 05:30.876
to try and get a more
Hollywood-style sound.

05:32.846 --> 05:35.314
And with his
makeshift boxing glove,

05:35.315 --> 05:39.751
Jamie will be able to throw
a full-blooded right hook.

05:41.020 --> 05:44.623
But despite pounding
the pork appreciably harder,

05:44.624 --> 05:47.359
it's clear the audio
still doesn't match up.

05:48.595 --> 05:50.462
It's still nowhere near.

05:55.935 --> 05:57.870
Next up, Kari, Grant, and Tory

05:57.871 --> 06:00.973
set sail for a physics thought experiment.

06:00.974 --> 06:05.144
Okay, now, <i>this</i> is what I'm talking about.

06:05.145 --> 06:06.879
So, can you tell us
what we're doing out here?

06:06.880 --> 06:08.113
Yeah, what, are we testing the myth

06:08.114 --> 06:09.882
of "if we take Grant sailing,
he's gonna throw up"?

06:09.883 --> 06:12.451
No, but we're actually
doing a sailing myth,

06:12.452 --> 06:14.219
so I figured, "why would we be
in the blueprint room"

06:14.220 --> 06:16.922
"when we can be out here"?

06:16.923 --> 06:19.124
All right, well, can we get on with it?

06:19.125 --> 06:21.760
Because this is a ticking time bomb.

06:21.761 --> 06:23.128
Okay, well, our next myth

06:23.129 --> 06:25.497
is actually this year's
"plane on a conveyer belt."

06:25.498 --> 06:26.999
They call it "blow your own sail."

06:27.000 --> 06:29.668
Ah, that's the one that,
if you have a windless day,

06:29.669 --> 06:32.070
if you take a giant fan
and blow it into your sail,

06:32.071 --> 06:33.672
you can actually start sailing.

06:33.673 --> 06:36.742
Exactly. But fans say it might not work.

06:36.743 --> 06:38.744
Right. Because of newtonian physics.

06:38.745 --> 06:41.013
All right, well, I think we need
to get to the bottom of this one.

06:41.014 --> 06:42.814
Or get sick trying.

06:42.815 --> 06:43.949
Speak for yourself, landlubber.

06:43.950 --> 06:47.186
It's a classic physics fable.

06:47.187 --> 06:50.722
Becalmed in the doldrums,
our hero pulls out a fan,

06:50.723 --> 06:54.860
whips up a wind, and, hey, presto...
she's blowing her own sail.

06:54.861 --> 06:59.464
But do Newton's laws really mean
this myth is dead in the water?

06:59.465 --> 07:02.568
What happens if you take
this physics thought experiment

07:02.569 --> 07:05.070
into the real world?

07:05.071 --> 07:07.339
Okay, it's not because I'm
prone to getting seasick,

07:07.340 --> 07:09.141
but shouldn't we go back to the shop

07:09.142 --> 07:11.243
and do some small-scale experiment?

07:11.244 --> 07:12.244
What?

07:12.245 --> 07:14.046
Why? I mean, we're here now.

07:14.047 --> 07:15.814
Let's just put a fan on here and go for it.

07:15.815 --> 07:18.217
Well, the problem is,
it's not a windless day.

07:18.218 --> 07:20.586
We won't know if we're
sailing because of our fan

07:20.587 --> 07:22.154
or because of a change in the wind.

07:22.155 --> 07:23.622
Ah, he's got a good point.

07:23.623 --> 07:25.190
All right, why don't we
go back to the shop,

07:25.191 --> 07:26.491
do some small-scale tests,

07:26.492 --> 07:28.594
get some miniature sailboats
and some miniature fans,

07:28.595 --> 07:31.997
and find out exactly what's
happening before we go full scale?

07:31.998 --> 07:33.599
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.367
Grant is looking a little green, isn't he?

07:37.704 --> 07:40.505
So, to avoid Grant's nautical nausea,

07:40.506 --> 07:43.542
it's back to terra firma, where
the goal is getting to grips

07:43.543 --> 07:46.111
with the underlying science of the story.

07:47.380 --> 07:50.148
So, this myth is essentially
about Newton's laws.

07:50.149 --> 07:53.185
And specifically, his first law,
which states that an object

07:53.186 --> 07:55.320
will remain in its current state of motion

07:55.321 --> 07:58.090
unless acted upon by an external force.

07:58.091 --> 08:00.192
Now, in our case, the
external object is the boat.

08:00.193 --> 08:02.227
Current state of motion... at rest.

08:02.228 --> 08:05.063
The external force... the
wind acts upon the boat

08:05.064 --> 08:07.266
and causes it to move along.

08:07.267 --> 08:09.368
Now, in the case of our sailor...

08:09.369 --> 08:12.137
If this person were able
to generate the wind

08:12.138 --> 08:15.841
while sitting on the boat, it's
no longer an external force.

08:15.842 --> 08:18.877
They're internal... in the
same frame of reference...

08:18.878 --> 08:22.447
so when they blow on it,
theoretically, the boat won't move.

08:22.448 --> 08:24.216
And worryingly for the myth,

08:24.217 --> 08:28.887
it's not just Newton's first law
making movement unlikely.

08:28.888 --> 08:31.456
So, there is another newtonian principle...

08:31.457 --> 08:35.527
that is the third law of motion,
which says that for every action,

08:35.528 --> 08:37.828
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

08:37.830 --> 08:40.866
So, therefore, if the fan
is blowing wind into the sail,

08:40.866 --> 08:43.335
it's also pushing the fan backwards.

08:43.336 --> 08:47.072
If this is true, these two forces
are gonna cancel each other out,

08:47.073 --> 08:48.640
and this boat's not gonna go anywhere.

08:48.641 --> 08:50.075
It's just gonna stall.

08:50.076 --> 08:52.210
So with two of Newton's laws

08:52.211 --> 08:54.546
lining up to sink this sea-going saga,

08:54.547 --> 08:58.016
the team prepares for a
proof-of-concept test...

08:58.017 --> 09:01.520
one that will put the scientific
theory into practice.

09:01.521 --> 09:04.056
And while Kari makes a raft on wheels,

09:04.057 --> 09:07.659
Tory stays high and dry on a fake blue sea.

09:07.660 --> 09:10.262
Because although this
myth is all about boats,

09:10.263 --> 09:12.631
there's no need to get wet yet.

09:13.766 --> 09:15.967
Now, obviously we could test it on water,

09:15.968 --> 09:17.803
but water poses a couple of problems.

09:17.804 --> 09:20.172
One, it takes a lot of force

09:20.173 --> 09:25.043
to get the boat to move through
the water... .44 pounds, to be exact.

09:25.044 --> 09:27.412
Plus, getting the boat to
move straight in the water

09:27.413 --> 09:29.381
is gonna be another problem
we have to overcome,

09:29.382 --> 09:31.083
but I have a solution for both of those.

09:31.084 --> 09:33.352
Instead of using the boat and water,

09:33.353 --> 09:36.722
we're gonna use this cart with
wheels on this flat piece of acrylic.

09:36.723 --> 09:38.523
That way, the cart will go straight,

09:38.524 --> 09:40.726
and we're gonna reduce
the amount of friction.

09:40.727 --> 09:44.129
It only takes .24 pounds
of force to move this car.

09:44.130 --> 09:45.230
This is gonna be perfect.

09:46.232 --> 09:49.034
Still to come on "MythBusters"...
- Wap-sha!

09:49.035 --> 09:51.036
...the audio action heats up,

09:51.037 --> 09:52.904
...there's a sting in the tail,

09:52.905 --> 09:55.107
This is Big Bob.

09:55.108 --> 09:57.776
...and Tory rides back to the future.

09:57.777 --> 10:00.345
This is a very bad idea.

10:06.949 --> 10:09.518
Over the years, the MythBusters

10:09.819 --> 10:11.854
have tackled a heap
of Hollywood tall tales.

10:11.855 --> 10:16.225
Until now, the myths have been based
upon the tendency of movie-makers

10:16.226 --> 10:21.931
to suspend reality with
physics-defying visual effects.

10:21.932 --> 10:26.035
But this time, Adam and Jamie
are hot on the aural trail.

10:26.036 --> 10:28.337
And to find out if a big-screen punch

10:28.338 --> 10:33.309
sounds anything like the real
thing, Adam's upping the ante.

10:33.310 --> 10:36.011
As I really don't want to hurt this anymore

10:36.012 --> 10:37.313
by punching this poor pig,

10:37.314 --> 10:41.117
I'm gonna make a fist-punching
analog... not a machine.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.618
It's gonna be pretty simple.

10:42.619 --> 10:46.021
It's gonna be a combination of
this and a combination of that.

10:46.022 --> 10:47.189
Here we go.

10:47.190 --> 10:50.126
The ballistics-gel fist
will provide an accurate-sounding

10:50.127 --> 10:52.828
skin-on-skin contact, and
the leverage of the bat

10:52.829 --> 10:56.899
will ensure Adam gets a good, solid hit.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.368
Wap-sha!

10:59.369 --> 11:01.237
I think it's ready.

11:02.906 --> 11:04.473
That was nice.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.377
Let's listen.

11:08.378 --> 11:11.046
To the naked ear,
it was a marked improvement,

11:11.047 --> 11:13.382
but let's get an objective comparison.

11:14.818 --> 11:15.951
That was pretty good.

11:15.952 --> 11:17.686
All right, let's listen to the movie sound.

11:20.791 --> 11:22.358
There's no comparison.

11:22.359 --> 11:26.495
If the myth was on the ropes before,
it's down for the count now.

11:26.496 --> 11:29.865
But if the movie effect isn't
a recording of a real punch,

11:29.866 --> 11:32.034
what exactly is it?

11:32.035 --> 11:33.402
We need to talk to an expert.

11:33.403 --> 11:36.105
I think we do.

11:36.106 --> 11:38.207
Where are we gonna find one?

11:38.208 --> 11:39.975
With a rÃ©sumÃ© that includes a heap

11:39.976 --> 11:41.877
of Tim Burton blockbusters,

11:41.878 --> 11:46.582
Steve knows exactly how
to pack a Hollywood punch.

11:46.583 --> 11:49.585
Why doesn't our best punch sound like this?

11:49.586 --> 11:53.055
You have a punch that
sounds like punching a face.

11:53.056 --> 11:54.757
The Hollywood one is not about that.

11:54.758 --> 11:57.560
It's about drama. It's
about selling the story.

11:57.561 --> 11:59.061
You might add a whoosh
of something like this...

11:59.062 --> 12:00.629
a pipe or a dowel.

12:00.630 --> 12:03.866
- All right.
- Just a little bit of that leading into

12:03.867 --> 12:06.402
the punch is gonna give you that
sense of the fist really moving fast.

12:06.403 --> 12:09.738
I noticed that you had
the really good slap sound,

12:09.739 --> 12:11.540
but you might want to have
a little bit of chest,

12:11.541 --> 12:13.008
kind of, like, low end to it.

12:13.009 --> 12:16.045
You can either just...

12:16.046 --> 12:19.315
Just a little bit of that can give
you that sense of kind of a skull

12:19.316 --> 12:21.550
- underneath that face slap that you got.
- Yeah.

12:21.551 --> 12:22.585
What else?

12:23.320 --> 12:28.591
You might want to hear the
sound of a skull cracking.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.460
Wow!

12:31.461 --> 12:33.395
Walnuts. I love it.

12:33.396 --> 12:35.431
So those are the individual elements

12:35.432 --> 12:39.134
that go to make up a Hollywood
punch, and by layering them,

12:39.135 --> 12:43.138
you get a result that's rich
in texture and depth.

12:43.139 --> 12:45.074
Let's take our best punch at the pig.

12:46.376 --> 12:48.444
All right, now, Steve said
it needed some low end.

12:48.445 --> 12:50.412
Let's take one of Steve's chest hits.

12:51.715 --> 12:53.115
Now, he said it needed a whoosh.

12:53.116 --> 12:56.018
Let's take one of the swings
he made of that little pipe.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.956
And then, finally, let's add in
some bone-cracking walnut sounds...

13:02.692 --> 13:04.693
and play them all together
and see what we get.

13:04.694 --> 13:06.762
It's pretty good, huh?

13:06.763 --> 13:09.431
Yep, but it doesn't change the result.

13:09.432 --> 13:13.836
Punch sound effects are Hollywood
fiction, and the myth is busted.

13:18.308 --> 13:21.343
Kari, Grant, and Tory
are tackling a maritime myth

13:21.344 --> 13:23.779
that contradicts the father of physics.

13:23.780 --> 13:28.017
Can you move your boat
by blowing your own sail?

13:28.018 --> 13:32.488
To find out, they're setting up
a small-scale proof-of-concept.

13:32.489 --> 13:34.657
Okay, the next step is the fans.

13:34.658 --> 13:36.191
So I got a whole bunch
of the little desk fans,

13:36.192 --> 13:38.460
and I'm gonna see if any of them are
gonna work for this experiment.

13:38.461 --> 13:40.229
When I turn them on and put them on here,

13:40.230 --> 13:42.998
it should push the little car backwards.

13:42.999 --> 13:47.469
- Kari needs to find a fan...
- Okay, you're not gonna work.

13:47.470 --> 13:50.873
- ...with a power-to-weight ratio...
- Nope.

13:50.874 --> 13:53.609
...that will make the raft move.

13:53.610 --> 13:54.944
I think it's too heavy.

13:54.945 --> 13:57.346
The desk fans are just too feeble,

13:57.347 --> 14:01.050
so Kari goes for broke
with a model airplane propeller.

14:01.051 --> 14:03.519
Okay, ready?

14:07.857 --> 14:09.858
That ought to work.

14:09.859 --> 14:13.329
Meanwhile, Grant has
a small-scale sail up his sleeve,

14:13.330 --> 14:15.531
and after he rigs it to the raft,

14:15.532 --> 14:18.901
the guys are all set to clear up
the fan-site controversy.

14:18.902 --> 14:20.436
Wow! Wow! Wow!

14:21.538 --> 14:23.672
When you blow your own sail,

14:23.673 --> 14:27.543
will you stall, as the
newtonian advocates predict,

14:27.544 --> 14:30.746
or sail off into the sunset?

14:30.747 --> 14:34.083
All right, now it's time to
replicate the myth in small scale.

14:34.084 --> 14:36.051
We have our fan attached to our raft,

14:36.052 --> 14:37.953
which is going to be blowing into the sail

14:37.954 --> 14:39.188
that's attached to the raft.

14:39.189 --> 14:41.290
Now, according to Newton's
third law of motion,

14:41.291 --> 14:44.159
these two forces should
cancel each other out,

14:44.160 --> 14:46.462
and this boat is gonna stall.

14:46.463 --> 14:49.598
So, just like in the myth,
the wind source is on the boat.

14:49.599 --> 14:50.966
Okay. Blow your own sail.

14:50.967 --> 14:51.967
Here we go.

14:55.338 --> 14:56.939
- All right.
- That's great.

14:56.940 --> 15:00.376
All right, looks like Newton's laws
are canceling out cartoon laws.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.844
Yep, and here's how.

15:01.845 --> 15:05.614
If you do a test without
the sail, using just the fan,

15:05.615 --> 15:09.618
you can see there's enough thrust
to move the boat backwards.

15:09.619 --> 15:12.888
But put a sail in the way,
and that backwards thrust

15:12.889 --> 15:16.058
is canceled out by the
equal and opposite force

15:16.059 --> 15:17.993
pushing the boat forward.

15:17.994 --> 15:21.196
The boat stalls, and the myth is busted.

15:21.197 --> 15:22.531
Or is it?

15:22.532 --> 15:26.502
Because our intrepid trio
aren't giving up so easily.

15:26.503 --> 15:29.338
Coming up next on "MythBusters,"

15:29.339 --> 15:33.275
can we use this fan to blow our own sail?

15:39.044 --> 15:40.444
What do we have next?

15:40.445 --> 15:42.913
Well, as you know, the rattlesnake...

15:42.914 --> 15:46.784
the venomous rattlesnake
and its iconic warning rattle

15:46.785 --> 15:49.487
are completely endemic to American Western.

15:49.488 --> 15:52.089
And what I want to know is,
is the sound we're accustomed

15:52.090 --> 15:56.393
to hearing from the rattlesnake
actually a real rattlesnake sound?

15:56.394 --> 15:58.095
Well, this isn't a rattler.

15:58.096 --> 16:00.564
This is a Madagascar tree boa.

16:00.565 --> 16:03.400
You are such a buzz kill.

16:03.401 --> 16:04.835
She likes you.

16:04.836 --> 16:05.836
Yeah.

16:05.837 --> 16:07.104
I like her.

16:07.105 --> 16:09.740
Anybody that's seen a Western

16:09.741 --> 16:11.976
knows the sound that a rattlesnake makes,

16:11.977 --> 16:16.413
but is that actually the sound,
or is that a movie construct?

16:16.414 --> 16:20.050
So we're gonna have to get
ourselves a real rattlesnake

16:20.051 --> 16:23.020
and see what they sound like.

16:23.021 --> 16:25.790
So, Owen, are we gonna be
able to get him to rattle

16:25.791 --> 16:27.491
without freaking him out?

16:27.492 --> 16:30.161
Well, this is Big Bob,
and just try stopping him.

16:30.162 --> 16:31.328
Really?

16:31.329 --> 16:32.963
- Yeah.
- He likes to rattle?

16:32.964 --> 16:34.465
He likes to talk.

16:34.466 --> 16:39.136
This is Big Bob, and this
is the classic movie sound effect

16:39.137 --> 16:40.337
of the rattlesnake.

16:45.310 --> 16:49.980
What we want to know is how much
like that does Big Bob sound?

16:49.981 --> 16:51.048
Shall we record this guy?

16:51.049 --> 16:52.216
I think so.

16:52.217 --> 16:53.784
Here we go.

16:53.785 --> 16:55.820
Let's go for it.

16:58.490 --> 17:00.457
Awesome!

17:00.458 --> 17:01.759
There we go.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.127
That sounded pretty good,

17:03.128 --> 17:06.130
but let's get an objective assessment.

17:06.131 --> 17:07.998
All right.

17:07.999 --> 17:11.435
Let's start with the movie rattlesnake.

17:11.435 --> 17:12.703
Here we go.

17:19.044 --> 17:20.877
And now here's Big Bob.

17:28.453 --> 17:29.854
That is dead on!

17:29.855 --> 17:31.021
That's the same sound.

17:31.022 --> 17:34.191
Absolutely clear that
they used real rattlesnakes

17:34.192 --> 17:36.093
to make rattlesnake sounds in films.

17:36.094 --> 17:37.261
I think so.

17:37.262 --> 17:38.395
Confirmed!

17:45.604 --> 17:48.005
So far in "blow your own sail",

17:48.006 --> 17:50.608
there are no flaws in Newton's laws.

17:50.609 --> 17:53.210
The forward thrust captured by the sail

17:53.211 --> 17:56.714
has an equal and opposite
force pushing backwards,

17:56.715 --> 17:59.216
leaving the boat grounded.

17:59.217 --> 18:00.451
But it's not over yet.

18:00.452 --> 18:04.288
The team thinks that tweaking the
variables might get things moving.

18:04.289 --> 18:06.090
So, we're gonna do
all sorts of experiments.

18:06.091 --> 18:08.058
We're gonna try different sails,
we're gonna try different winds,

18:08.059 --> 18:10.861
and we're gonna see if we can
actually blow your own sail.

18:10.862 --> 18:13.464
Yep, with the fan, sail, and boat

18:13.465 --> 18:16.567
all in proportion,
everything is canceled out.

18:16.568 --> 18:21.038
So they're starting by making
their small-scale sail smaller.

18:21.039 --> 18:23.741
Now, you're probably asking yourself,

18:23.742 --> 18:25.542
"why are you guys testing a small sail"?

18:25.543 --> 18:27.177
But if you look to the graphic,

18:27.178 --> 18:29.013
you'll see what I think is gonna happen.

18:29.014 --> 18:32.750
I think that the wind is gonna
actually get around the small sail

18:32.751 --> 18:34.785
and push the sailboat backwards.

18:34.786 --> 18:37.955
Now, given what we've seen so far,
it may seem surprising to you

18:37.956 --> 18:40.124
that we think the boat
is gonna travel backwards.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.893
Now, there's a lot of thrust
coming off of this prop.

18:42.894 --> 18:46.397
If the size of the sail is small
compared to source of the wind,

18:46.398 --> 18:47.898
you may get some of that thrust

18:47.899 --> 18:49.934
escaping around the edges of the sail,

18:49.935 --> 18:53.804
giving us a net thrust,
pushing the boat backwards.

18:53.805 --> 18:55.172
All right, here we go.

18:55.173 --> 18:57.274
3, 2, 1.

18:58.710 --> 19:00.778
Hey, look at that. It cancels itself out.

19:00.779 --> 19:03.981
All right, you know what?
Should we turn up the speed?

19:03.982 --> 19:06.216
- Sure.
- Yeah, let's try it and see what happens.

19:09.888 --> 19:10.621
Whoa!

19:12.390 --> 19:13.991
- That was weird.
- It's going backwards.

19:14.993 --> 19:18.362
It seems if the sail
contains all of the fan's thrust,

19:18.363 --> 19:23.200
the boat is marooned, but tweak
the sail size and fan speed,

19:23.201 --> 19:24.401
and you start moving.

19:24.402 --> 19:27.338
However, they're heading
in the wrong direction.

19:27.339 --> 19:30.607
To reverse that, maybe
they need to go bigger.

19:30.608 --> 19:33.911
For the next test, we've
stepped up the size of the sail.

19:33.912 --> 19:36.613
But to do that, we also
had to raise the fan

19:36.614 --> 19:39.583
so that the air stream hits right
into the center of our sail.

19:39.584 --> 19:40.818
Hopefully this will propel the boat.

19:42.287 --> 19:43.854
- Ready when you are.
- Okay. Here we go.

19:45.423 --> 19:46.690
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:46.691 --> 19:48.125
It's not going forward at all.

19:48.126 --> 19:50.861
The forces are still
canceling each other out.

19:50.862 --> 19:51.929
Can you dial it up?

19:52.931 --> 19:54.999
Going to 100%.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.767
Whoa! That's looking scary!

19:56.768 --> 19:59.303
It's starting to go! It's starting to go!

19:59.304 --> 20:01.472
Faster! It's moving forward!

20:01.473 --> 20:02.973
Whoo!

20:02.974 --> 20:04.708
Hey!

20:04.709 --> 20:06.910
Hey!

20:06.911 --> 20:10.314
With faster wind speed,
you <i>can</i> blow your own sail.

20:10.315 --> 20:12.182
All right, look... I'm not a sailor,

20:12.183 --> 20:13.751
and I'm not an aeronautical engineer,

20:13.752 --> 20:15.886
but this is what I think is happening.

20:15.887 --> 20:18.856
So, the fan provides a
certain amount of thrust

20:18.857 --> 20:20.457
that blows into the sail.

20:20.458 --> 20:23.660
The sail, in turn, can only
absorb so much of that thrust.

20:23.661 --> 20:25.896
The rest of it gets reflected back,

20:25.897 --> 20:31.735
leaving us with a net-thrust vector,
causing the boat to go forward.

20:31.736 --> 20:35.339
Yep, the reflection
means the sum of the total thrust

20:35.340 --> 20:37.374
is in a forward direction.

20:37.375 --> 20:39.676
So, you just need a lot more wind.

20:39.677 --> 20:41.111
A lot more.

20:41.112 --> 20:42.880
What is the most wind we can produce

20:42.881 --> 20:44.381
with the biggest fan we can use?

20:44.382 --> 20:46.150
- Jet engine.
- Yeah!

20:46.151 --> 20:48.318
- That would be awesome.
- Now you're talking.

20:48.319 --> 20:50.554
What a great proof-of-concept, though.

20:51.990 --> 20:54.792
Next on "MythBusters"...
- Come on!

20:54.793 --> 20:57.494
...will "blow your own sail" take off?

21:01.477 --> 21:02.744
Kari, Grant, and Tory

21:02.745 --> 21:06.414
have found that with enough
puff and big enough sail,

21:06.415 --> 21:08.483
it is possible to blow your own sail.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.385
Oh, more power!

21:10.386 --> 21:13.755
But their little toy
raft didn't move very fast.

21:13.756 --> 21:17.959
To nail this sea-going
saga in the small scale,

21:17.960 --> 21:20.895
the team feel the need for more speed.

21:20.896 --> 21:24.833
So we are moving on to a
jet-cap model turbine engine.

21:24.834 --> 21:28.903
This thing can make a model
plane fly at 250 miles an hour.

21:28.904 --> 21:32.907
It puts out 17.5 pounds of thrust.

21:32.908 --> 21:34.943
This is gonna give us the
wind speeds that we need.

21:34.944 --> 21:36.578
But first, what I need to do

21:36.579 --> 21:39.647
is mount this engine to
our longboard skateboard.

21:39.648 --> 21:41.416
And the reason why we're using
a longboard skateboard

21:41.417 --> 21:43.718
is because this thing
puts out so much heat,

21:43.719 --> 21:46.521
we got to keep our sail
away from the source.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.490
And speaking of heat...

21:48.491 --> 21:50.725
So, one of the problems with
upgrading our source of thrust

21:50.726 --> 21:53.328
to a jet engine is that the exhaust gases

21:53.329 --> 21:55.897
can be in excess of 600 degrees Celsius.

21:55.898 --> 21:56.965
Now, this is silk.

21:56.966 --> 22:01.102
This is the ideal material we found
for our small-scale experiment.

22:01.103 --> 22:04.072
The only problem with silk is that
when you expose it to flame...

22:06.942 --> 22:08.176
this happens.

22:08.177 --> 22:11.713
So while Grant looks into
flame-resistant sail materials,

22:11.714 --> 22:14.082
Tory gets busy with the sailboard build.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.651
Just like before, they'll be on land

22:16.652 --> 22:20.522
using wheels rather
than on water in a boat.

22:20.523 --> 22:22.424
It's kind of fitting that
we're using this jet engine,

22:22.425 --> 22:25.527
'cause a long time ago,
I actually built a jet engine

22:25.528 --> 22:27.529
out of a vacuum cleaner motor.

22:27.530 --> 22:30.665
It didn't have much thrust.

22:30.666 --> 22:33.001
I mean, it practically
had no thrust at all,

22:33.002 --> 22:35.670
but it's kind of cool to
actually use a real jet engine

22:35.671 --> 22:36.604
for an experiment.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.875
With the baby engine
on board, it's over to Grant.

22:40.876 --> 22:45.580
Okay, so, this is flame-resistant material.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.982
This is a 6061 aluminum frame,

22:47.983 --> 22:51.319
which has a melting temperature
above that of the jet exhaust.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.954
This is the kind of sail you're gonna need

22:52.955 --> 22:56.090
if you're gonna use a jet engine
to blow yourself along.

22:56.091 --> 22:58.760
The jet-powered sailboard is done.

22:58.761 --> 23:00.695
Now to give it a run.

23:02.198 --> 23:05.600
There are not many places you
can fire off a mini jet engine,

23:05.601 --> 23:08.837
but a creepy, abandoned naval base is one.

23:08.838 --> 23:10.338
This thing looks dangerous.

23:10.339 --> 23:12.440
Yeah, I think we need
to ride it before we test.

23:12.441 --> 23:15.243
- What do you think?
- Ride a jet-powered skateboard?

23:15.244 --> 23:16.644
Yeah! Aren't you guys dying to do it?

23:16.645 --> 23:19.814
Not really, but I would
enjoy another decade

23:19.815 --> 23:21.883
of watching you fall off
this thing in slow motion.

23:21.884 --> 23:22.884
It worked for the bicycle.

23:22.885 --> 23:24.419
Oh!

23:24.420 --> 23:28.590
I think this is a very bad idea.

23:28.591 --> 23:30.692
So, before we start doing the experiment,

23:30.693 --> 23:32.093
I want to test this engine.

23:32.094 --> 23:33.528
So I've turned the engine around.

23:33.529 --> 23:35.663
That way I can ride it,
and I won't burn my butt.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.032
And fortunately for Tory,

23:38.033 --> 23:41.269
our health insurance actually
covers a full body cast.

23:41.270 --> 23:43.738
Kind of getting nervous. I don't know why.

23:43.739 --> 23:47.475
So if anything untoward should
happen, he'll be covered.

23:48.611 --> 23:50.445
What could possibly go wrong?

23:50.446 --> 23:52.647
I got a jet engine strapped
to this skateboard.

23:54.283 --> 23:56.050
All right, firing it up.

23:56.051 --> 23:57.519
Medics standing by.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.921
Somebody dial 91.

24:05.594 --> 24:07.128
On his jet-powered skateboard,

24:07.129 --> 24:10.365
is Tory about to take a trip to the future

24:10.366 --> 24:13.134
or a trip back to the E.R.?

24:21.810 --> 24:23.344
Oh, my God, it worked!

24:23.345 --> 24:27.048
Every kid's gonna want one
of these for Christmas.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.449
Now, that was a good test.

24:28.450 --> 24:30.518
I mean, what that tells me
is that the jet engine,

24:30.519 --> 24:32.854
which, mind you, is only this big,

24:32.855 --> 24:35.690
provides enough thrust to carry Tory,

24:35.691 --> 24:39.027
who weighs 175 pounds,
on top of the skateboard.

24:40.329 --> 24:42.964
Now, if we replace Tory with the sail,

24:42.965 --> 24:46.935
I think we're gonna have plenty
of thrust for our experiment.

24:48.671 --> 24:51.506
All right, this is extreme
"blow your own sail".

24:51.507 --> 24:52.440
Do it.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.443
Oh, I love this sound.

24:56.512 --> 24:59.347
Come on, baby!

24:59.348 --> 25:00.281
Come on!

25:00.282 --> 25:01.616
Come on!

25:01.617 --> 25:02.784
- Got to love that sound.
- Come on!

25:02.785 --> 25:04.686
- It's going! It's going!
- It's moving!

25:08.190 --> 25:09.824
That worked perfectly.

25:09.825 --> 25:13.828
The jet engine was powerful enough
to overcome the canceling forces,

25:13.829 --> 25:16.297
and we got our sailboat to move forward.

25:16.298 --> 25:17.699
Whoo!

25:19.168 --> 25:21.836
All right, we did it!

25:21.837 --> 25:23.504
We blew our own sail!

25:23.505 --> 25:24.839
Nice!

25:24.840 --> 25:27.275
So, initially, when we started
out testing this myth,

25:27.276 --> 25:30.678
it was with a very small
boat on top of a table.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.313
And this... this is what we do.

25:32.314 --> 25:35.016
We step things up each time,

25:35.017 --> 25:40.021
and we've gone to a jet-powered
skateboard with a fireproof sail.

25:40.022 --> 25:41.923
And I've got to say, this is great

25:41.924 --> 25:44.792
because what this says is that, each time,

25:44.793 --> 25:47.762
it's been possible to blow your own sail.

25:47.763 --> 25:50.565
Now we just got to go up to the
big thing... the real thing...

25:50.566 --> 25:51.766
the boat.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.301
Next step's gonna be fun.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.503
Full-scale, baby.

25:55.504 --> 25:56.671
And back at the shop,

25:56.672 --> 25:58.740
they've taken delivery of just the thing...

25:58.741 --> 26:01.909
a boat with a built-in fan.

26:01.910 --> 26:04.345
So, we are gonna take this myth full-scale,

26:04.346 --> 26:06.147
and this is the boat we are gonna use.

26:06.148 --> 26:09.083
It is a shallow-water spider swamp boat.

26:09.084 --> 26:10.918
And this thing comes with a fan,

26:10.919 --> 26:13.655
which is attached to a 40-horsepower engine

26:13.656 --> 26:17.325
that's capable of putting
out 200 pounds of thrust.

26:20.362 --> 26:22.864
We're gonna take this fan, flip it around,

26:22.865 --> 26:27.535
put up a mast, put up the sail, and
see if we can blow our own sail.

26:27.536 --> 26:28.803
It was dragging me.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.872
It was actually pulling me off my feet.

26:30.873 --> 26:32.340
I think this is gonna do it.

26:32.341 --> 26:35.610
With Grant measuring
wind speeds of 63 miles per hour,

26:35.611 --> 26:39.347
this puppy is clearly powerful enough...

26:39.348 --> 26:42.016
which means it's time
to take delivery of the sail

26:42.017 --> 26:43.551
and get busy with the rigging.

26:45.187 --> 26:48.456
Okay, now that we have the sail,
it's time to erect the mast.

26:48.457 --> 26:49.991
Now, we're making it out of aluminum

26:49.992 --> 26:52.894
because it's lightweight and has
a really high tensile strength.

26:52.895 --> 26:55.329
But we're making a removable
base completely out of steel.

26:55.330 --> 26:58.633
We want to clamp onto the boat
instead of drilling or welding

26:58.634 --> 27:01.869
because it's a borrowed
boat and it's gorgeous.

27:01.870 --> 27:05.006
Against all odds, our team of landlubbers

27:05.007 --> 27:08.342
has built and rigged its own
square sail from scratch.

27:08.343 --> 27:10.178
Faster.

27:10.179 --> 27:11.612
Go faster.

27:11.613 --> 27:13.147
Whoo!

27:14.616 --> 27:15.850
Ready to blow your sail?

27:17.986 --> 27:19.353
Yeah, I don't have enough wind.

27:19.354 --> 27:22.990
To find out if it'll go when the fan blows,

27:22.991 --> 27:25.526
it's time to take this test
down to the waterline.

27:25.527 --> 27:28.029
We found ourselves a lake
that's completely isolated

27:28.030 --> 27:30.164
so we have no current and no wind.

27:30.165 --> 27:32.233
This should be the perfect
place to experiment.

27:32.234 --> 27:36.170
And the perfect
place for a pre-test joyride.

27:36.171 --> 27:39.307
With the throttle full on,
the team thrashes around,

27:39.308 --> 27:40.842
getting their bearings

27:40.843 --> 27:45.113
and getting a feel for the swamp
boat's fan-powered thrust.

27:46.515 --> 27:48.049
It handles beautifully.

27:48.050 --> 27:49.050
Love it.

27:49.051 --> 27:50.551
But will it sail?

27:57.314 --> 27:59.749
The next classic Hollywood sound effect

27:59.750 --> 28:02.785
to get the MythBusters
treatment is the gun silencer.

28:04.488 --> 28:06.990
And down at the South
San Francisco Police Department

28:06.991 --> 28:10.793
shooting range, the boys mean business.

28:10.794 --> 28:15.298
Cue Meyer Sound's senior audio
scientist, Dr. Roger Schwenke.

28:16.066 --> 28:19.469
With several previous
appearances on the show,

28:19.470 --> 28:23.106
he gets the much-sought-after
title of "honorary mythbuster".

28:23.107 --> 28:25.275
Stir the pot, baby.

28:26.377 --> 28:28.578
And today, he's brought along

28:28.579 --> 28:31.648
his laboratory-grade recording
and analysis equipment.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.317
We want to see whether these things

28:34.318 --> 28:36.920
actually make the same sounds in real life

28:36.921 --> 28:40.957
that they do in the movies, or
do they make any sound at all?

28:40.958 --> 28:42.358
How do these silencers work?

28:42.359 --> 28:46.162
Well, they're kind of
like mufflers on cars.

28:46.163 --> 28:50.133
They've got a series of baffles
in them that sort of slow down

28:50.134 --> 28:53.136
and redirect the gases
that are passing through

28:53.137 --> 28:55.705
and absorb a lot of the
energy and the sound.

28:55.706 --> 28:57.774
That's how silencers silence,

28:57.775 --> 29:02.111
but outside a movie theater,
what exactly are they used for?

29:02.112 --> 29:04.514
Look, we would be
remiss if we didn't explain

29:04.515 --> 29:05.982
that this is not an assassin's tool.

29:05.983 --> 29:07.884
Actually, military and law enforcement

29:07.885 --> 29:09.852
love suppressors for four main reasons.

29:09.853 --> 29:11.821
The extra weight out
at the front of the gun

29:11.822 --> 29:15.191
actually reduces both muzzle
lift and the recoil of the gun,

29:15.192 --> 29:17.460
making it easier to aim and stay on target.

29:17.461 --> 29:20.563
It does, actually, reduce the
sound and the concussion...

29:20.564 --> 29:21.731
the blast of the bullet.

29:21.732 --> 29:24.300
And it also reduces the
muzzle flash to zero.

29:24.301 --> 29:28.471
All of which makes this a safer
and easier weapon to use.

29:28.472 --> 29:30.673
Right. Let's get down to testing.

29:30.674 --> 29:34.911
First up, Adam and Jamie
take aim at a baseline.

29:34.912 --> 29:38.615
First, we are going to fire an
unmodified pistol at the target.

29:38.616 --> 29:41.284
And 3, 2, 1.

29:44.588 --> 29:47.523
Then we're going to put
a silencer on that gun

29:47.524 --> 29:49.258
and shoot again at the target

29:49.259 --> 29:53.663
and compare the silenced round
sound to the original gun sound

29:53.664 --> 29:57.600
and to the movie sound
effect of a silencer.

30:00.504 --> 30:04.107
I'm holding a silenced pistol!

30:04.108 --> 30:06.209
It's just as cool as you think it is.

30:06.210 --> 30:07.677
Now for the suppressor.

30:07.678 --> 30:10.546
Is the movie version anything like reality?

30:10.547 --> 30:11.848
Thank you.

30:11.849 --> 30:15.184
Do silencers work as well
in real life as they do on film?

30:19.423 --> 30:20.523
That's nice.

30:20.524 --> 30:22.125
That was pretty cool.

30:22.126 --> 30:24.627
That seemed a lot quieter
than I thought it would.

30:24.628 --> 30:28.398
And Jamie's 9-millimeter
pistol is equally surprising.

30:30.968 --> 30:33.369
It's an impressive improvement,

30:33.370 --> 30:36.906
but for analysis, let's hear
from our expert acoustician.

30:36.907 --> 30:41.477
First, decibels... a measure of the
intensity of the sound pressure.

30:41.478 --> 30:46.315
So, we go from 161, and then
suppressed, we go down to 128.

30:46.316 --> 30:48.518
That's a big change.

30:48.519 --> 30:52.155
That goes from dangerous
to your hearing to safe.

30:52.156 --> 30:53.656
But it's not just the power.

30:53.657 --> 30:57.460
The texture and time signature
of the sound is also altered.

30:57.461 --> 30:59.328
Can we hear them?

30:59.329 --> 31:00.897
Here's the unsuppressed.

31:01.965 --> 31:04.000
Okay, now let's hear suppressed.

31:06.837 --> 31:08.538
Yeah, that tells the story.

31:08.539 --> 31:11.107
And it's a story worth hearing again.

31:13.343 --> 31:15.445
A story with a surprise ending.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.414
I swear, I went into this one

31:18.415 --> 31:21.884
thinking this would be completely
busted, and I'm kind of blown away.

31:21.885 --> 31:24.520
But what about the
all-important movie version?

31:24.521 --> 31:26.489
How does that stack up?

31:26.490 --> 31:27.523
Can we hear the Hollywood sound?

31:27.524 --> 31:29.358
Yeah, sure.

31:30.661 --> 31:32.195
Dude, that is far out.

31:32.196 --> 31:33.329
Far out, indeed.

31:33.330 --> 31:37.066
But although it's not quite identical...

31:38.335 --> 31:41.003
the real-life suppressor
does reduce the volume

31:41.004 --> 31:43.473
of the gunshot to Hollywood levels.

31:46.443 --> 31:48.578
And that's enough to impress Adam... a lot.

31:49.680 --> 31:52.148
One of the most common questions we get is,

31:52.149 --> 31:55.618
are we surprised by the results
that we come up with on the show?

31:55.619 --> 31:59.055
Today... monstrously surprised.

31:59.056 --> 32:00.490
I arrived at work this morning

32:00.491 --> 32:02.825
expecting that we would
completely bust the myth

32:02.826 --> 32:06.028
that you could possibly
suppress the sound of a bullet

32:06.029 --> 32:08.364
anywhere close to what the
movies would lead you to believe,

32:08.365 --> 32:13.569
and I leave today being
a convert to the idea

32:13.570 --> 32:14.837
this thing is totally plausible.

32:17.007 --> 32:18.674
The only reason I'm
not calling it confirmed

32:18.675 --> 32:20.810
is because instead of a "kew! kew!" sound

32:20.811 --> 32:21.944
like they do in the movies...

32:21.945 --> 32:23.713
I'm shooting my cameraman's
knees out here...

32:23.714 --> 32:26.415
...it's more like a "pff! pff!" sound.

32:26.416 --> 32:29.352
But that is picking nits
as far as I'm concerned.

32:29.353 --> 32:31.354
This is astonishing.

32:36.126 --> 32:37.994
Okay, so, here's the plan...

32:37.995 --> 32:41.130
We've got our full-size fan
boat and our full-size sail.

32:41.131 --> 32:43.266
We get out on the water and try it first

32:43.267 --> 32:46.335
in its regular configuration
of fan facing backwards,

32:46.336 --> 32:48.037
and we'll turn it on and,
hopefully, go forward.

32:48.038 --> 32:51.874
Then, we're going to flip the
fan around, raise the sail...

32:51.875 --> 32:54.043
All right, we're in.

32:54.044 --> 32:56.746
...and see if you can
actually blow your own sail.

32:56.747 --> 32:58.314
There she blows!

32:58.315 --> 33:01.050
So, first up, with
the fan pointing backwards,

33:01.051 --> 33:04.554
Kari and Grant will do a
straight-line speed test.

33:04.555 --> 33:08.758
That way, when they get the sail
up and face the fan forwards,

33:08.759 --> 33:11.027
they'll have a reference
for their performance.

33:11.028 --> 33:14.130
How do you feel about calling
this the <i>"Queen Airy"?</i>

33:16.233 --> 33:17.667
She may have a name,

33:17.668 --> 33:21.370
but the <i>"Queen Airy"</i> is
not off to the best of starts.

33:21.371 --> 33:24.740
I think we're in a bit
of a predicament here.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.008
The weight of the sail

33:26.009 --> 33:29.178
is making it very tricky to maneuver.

33:29.179 --> 33:31.981
All right, you guys
are going zero miles an hour.

33:31.982 --> 33:35.585
But despite Tory's encouragement...

33:35.586 --> 33:38.120
Looks like these islands are boat magnets.

33:38.121 --> 33:41.791
...Grant and Kari do
finally get into position.

33:41.792 --> 33:45.328
The first test up is the
fan in the right configuration,

33:45.329 --> 33:46.729
the sail down.

33:46.730 --> 33:49.732
I'm gonna get in the chase boat,
have them drive towards me,

33:49.733 --> 33:52.368
and I'm gonna check their
speed with the radar gun.

33:52.369 --> 33:54.971
All right, this is the first test...

33:54.972 --> 33:58.507
fan facing backwards, sail down speed test.

33:58.508 --> 34:00.243
Here we go.

34:01.912 --> 34:04.513
Now, if you asked me
when we were in the shop

34:04.514 --> 34:06.315
and we first turned on the swamp boat

34:06.316 --> 34:07.617
and Grant took out the anemometer

34:07.618 --> 34:09.819
and got 60 miles an hour
standing behind the fan,

34:09.820 --> 34:12.188
I would have said that
"blow your own sailboat"

34:12.188 --> 34:14.657
was going to... boom!...
blast across the water.

34:14.658 --> 34:18.594
But now that we've done a
test with the mast on,

34:18.594 --> 34:22.697
even with the sail down,
it really slowed down the boat.

34:22.699 --> 34:26.369
I think we're gonna get some
movement, but it's gonna be slight.

34:26.370 --> 34:28.237
How fast were we?

34:28.237 --> 34:29.237
20 miles an hour.

34:30.407 --> 34:31.607
That was a good test.

34:31.608 --> 34:33.609
Let's flip the fan around
and put the sail up

34:33.610 --> 34:35.578
and see how fast we go
when we blow our own sail.

34:35.579 --> 34:37.280
- Aaah!
- Aah!

34:39.449 --> 34:40.483
Whoop.

34:46.271 --> 34:49.940
Kari, Grant, and Tory
are preparing to flip the fan

34:49.940 --> 34:53.744
and raise the sail for
a physics-defying finale.

34:54.911 --> 34:59.016
They're about to find out,
with a real boat on real water,

34:59.017 --> 35:01.752
if it's possible to really
blow your own sail.

35:01.753 --> 35:04.321
But plain sailing it's not.

35:04.322 --> 35:08.392
I feel like there might be just
a little element of danger here.

35:08.393 --> 35:10.260
I hope that holds.

35:10.261 --> 35:13.830
I mean, the swamp boat is not
meant to have the fan backwards,

35:13.831 --> 35:15.132
and it's definitely not meant

35:15.133 --> 35:17.634
to have this giant, lumbering sail on it.

35:17.635 --> 35:19.069
How's your line of sight?

35:19.070 --> 35:23.307
I think we might actually have
a little danger of tipping.

35:23.308 --> 35:25.909
I just really don't want to get wet today.

35:25.910 --> 35:27.411
Raise the mainsail!

35:28.179 --> 35:30.547
Trim the jibjab!

35:30.548 --> 35:32.949
I'm trimming as fast as I can!

35:32.950 --> 35:35.118
Now, in order for this
myth to be confirmed,

35:35.119 --> 35:37.621
what we're looking for is forward movement

35:37.622 --> 35:40.657
due to the fan blowing into the sail.

35:40.658 --> 35:43.393
Not drifting, not just poking along...

35:43.394 --> 35:47.431
we're actually talking about
directed forward movement.

35:47.432 --> 35:49.833
We get that, and we're
looking at "confirmed."

35:49.834 --> 35:52.169
Okay, I think that looks parallel.

35:52.170 --> 35:53.737
So, what we're also interested in

35:53.738 --> 35:57.441
is the comparison of the speed
of the fan blowing into the sail

35:57.442 --> 36:01.011
versus the fan pointed backwards.

36:01.012 --> 36:03.080
All right, you guys ready?

36:03.081 --> 36:04.581
Will we get improvement?

36:04.582 --> 36:06.183
Probably not.

36:06.184 --> 36:08.719
The target that we're
looking at is 20 miles an hour.

36:08.720 --> 36:13.657
If we get even a quarter
of that... 5 miles an hour...

36:13.658 --> 36:15.392
I will be very, very impressed.

36:15.393 --> 36:18.261
Or... and it's a very real possibility...

36:18.262 --> 36:22.332
the shallow-bottom boat with its
top-heavy sail goes bottom up.

36:22.333 --> 36:25.702
Okay, we're in.

36:25.703 --> 36:28.105
We have no idea what can go wrong.

36:28.106 --> 36:31.541
I mean, the mast could blow off.
The boat could flip over.

36:31.542 --> 36:33.243
They might get sucked into the fan

36:33.244 --> 36:35.245
and chopped up into little pieces.

36:35.246 --> 36:36.880
Hey, good sailing.

36:36.881 --> 36:38.382
Good luck.

36:38.383 --> 36:40.384
What was that about
being sucked into the fan?

36:40.385 --> 36:42.285
Chopped into little pieces?

36:42.286 --> 36:44.521
They're off.

36:44.522 --> 36:47.157
Tory in the support vehicle
tows them out to open water.

36:48.793 --> 36:52.429
With plenty of space,
no major winds or currents,

36:52.430 --> 36:56.700
it's the perfect location for
a spot of scientific sailing.

36:56.701 --> 36:59.202
- All right, you ready to do this?
- Ready.

36:59.203 --> 37:01.037
Okay. Here we go.

37:01.038 --> 37:05.242
This is "blow your own sail"
with the full-size boat.

37:05.243 --> 37:08.345
Full throttle!

37:12.116 --> 37:13.617
I got to tell you, the funniest part

37:13.618 --> 37:17.020
about this whole experiment is
when we first turned on that fan

37:17.021 --> 37:21.558
and the boat just started to spin
and dip down in one direction.

37:21.559 --> 37:24.294
Grant and I both were super wide-eyed

37:24.295 --> 37:26.730
because we thought we were going over.

37:26.731 --> 37:28.765
They're wildly out of control.

37:28.766 --> 37:30.467
There's no forward movement,

37:30.468 --> 37:33.003
just a whole lot of spinning and crashing.

37:37.308 --> 37:39.676
So, when we first started and I gunned it,

37:39.677 --> 37:41.611
we started turning in a circle.

37:41.612 --> 37:43.580
I was like, "This is it. That's it."

37:43.581 --> 37:45.515
"We're going in the water."

37:45.516 --> 37:49.186
But I turned it down,
and we tried it again,

37:49.187 --> 37:51.621
- and, actually, what I found was...
- Yeah!

37:51.622 --> 37:53.323
It's moving forward!

37:53.324 --> 37:55.091
...if you keep vectoring the fan,

37:55.092 --> 37:57.861
if you keep that thrust at the sail,

37:57.862 --> 38:00.630
you can actually get it to go forward.

38:04.302 --> 38:06.636
There she blows!

38:06.637 --> 38:09.973
Look at it! They're going forward!

38:09.974 --> 38:11.675
We blew our own sail!

38:11.676 --> 38:13.276
It's working!

38:13.277 --> 38:16.112
By ramping it up
MythBusters-style, the team

38:16.113 --> 38:19.683
has seemingly contradicted
newtonian physics.

38:19.684 --> 38:20.917
It's working!

38:20.918 --> 38:23.587
They're blowing their own sail.

38:23.588 --> 38:26.556
Now, this was nuts.

38:26.557 --> 38:30.160
We only got 3 miles an hour,
but we actually got movement.

38:30.161 --> 38:32.562
We got forward movement,
and we were able to steer

38:32.563 --> 38:35.932
by pointing the wind into
different parts of the sail.

38:35.933 --> 38:38.568
I have to say, this is a successful day.

38:41.372 --> 38:42.739
3 miles an hour!

38:47.979 --> 38:49.679
No doubt they'd go a lot faster

38:49.680 --> 38:54.451
with the fan facing backwards and
no sail, but that's not the point.

38:54.452 --> 38:58.788
The myth asks, can you power
a sailboat with your own fan?

38:58.789 --> 39:00.023
And you can.

39:00.024 --> 39:03.593
Now, I don't know
exactly what's going on,

39:03.594 --> 39:05.896
because apparently we're flying
in the face of Newton's laws,

39:05.897 --> 39:07.531
but here's what I think is happening.

39:07.532 --> 39:10.634
We have a significant amount
of thrust coming out of this fan.

39:10.635 --> 39:14.771
It's hitting the sail, and the
sail can only push so much.

39:14.772 --> 39:16.673
The rest of that thrust
gets reflected back,

39:16.674 --> 39:20.911
giving us a net thrust, pushing
us in a forward direction.

39:20.912 --> 39:23.179
And forward in both directions,

39:23.180 --> 39:26.349
because to prove that
real wind wasn't a factor,

39:26.350 --> 39:28.919
Grant and Kari sailed both ways.

39:30.588 --> 39:33.256
Dude, that was awesome!

39:33.257 --> 39:35.258
I cannot believe it!
We blew our own sail!

39:35.259 --> 39:37.027
This one is totally confirmed.

39:37.028 --> 39:38.428
Totally confirmed.

39:38.429 --> 39:42.499
I mean, this thing went forward
with the wind from our own fan.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.535
Confirmed!

39:48.706 --> 39:50.907
You may remember
in the opening sequence,

39:50.908 --> 39:55.445
Adam and Jamie set off a
Hollywood-style explosive fireball.

39:55.446 --> 39:58.014
Bye-bye.

39:58.015 --> 39:59.950
But despite having plenty,

39:59.951 --> 40:03.620
the guys didn't blow up
the car just for fun.

40:05.890 --> 40:07.691
It was part of the test to find out

40:07.692 --> 40:10.427
whether the ubiquitous
explosive sound effect

40:10.428 --> 40:14.497
you hear in the movies
is anything like the real thing.

40:14.498 --> 40:17.801
So first up, let's show you the ingredients

40:17.802 --> 40:21.137
of a typical silver-screen big bang.

40:21.138 --> 40:23.707
Two gallons of gasoline
ringed in some det cord

40:23.708 --> 40:25.141
and stuck in the front seat...

40:25.142 --> 40:29.446
that's how Hollywood makes its
spectacular fireball explosions.

40:29.447 --> 40:32.082
But what do they really sound like?

40:32.083 --> 40:33.183
Bye-bye.

40:35.119 --> 40:37.821
It's quite a difference, huh?

40:39.323 --> 40:42.058
Much like the punch,

40:42.059 --> 40:44.995
the movie version has
a lot more texture and depth.

40:46.931 --> 40:50.900
Quite simply, it's more
dramatic than the real thing.

40:53.037 --> 40:54.571
How did the wave forms compare?

40:54.572 --> 40:56.239
They're clearly very different.

40:56.240 --> 41:00.176
The gas explosion we just did
had a very sudden onset,

41:00.177 --> 41:01.978
and the energy is concentrated

41:01.979 --> 41:04.781
in a very narrow range of low frequencies.

41:06.717 --> 41:11.187
Whereas the classic movie explosion...

41:11.188 --> 41:12.656
has a much slower onset,

41:12.657 --> 41:17.227
and the energy is over a much
wider range of frequencies,

41:17.228 --> 41:19.863
and it lasts for a much, much longer time.

41:19.864 --> 41:21.297
It's a very different sound.

41:21.298 --> 41:24.801
Which sounds like a busted myth,

41:24.802 --> 41:26.102
but the guys aren't done yet.

41:26.103 --> 41:29.339
They're not getting bogged
down with just one big boom.

41:29.340 --> 41:33.043
If the sound of a gasoline-fueled fireball

41:33.044 --> 41:37.881
doesn't match the movies,
maybe a real high explosive will.

41:37.882 --> 41:40.517
Cue our old friend C-4.

41:41.352 --> 41:44.721
Now we're gonna blow
this car up for realsies

41:44.722 --> 41:46.623
and check out how that sounds.

41:46.624 --> 41:47.791
All right, here we go.

41:47.792 --> 41:53.797
2.2 pounds of C-4 in 3, 2, 1!

41:59.570 --> 42:01.371
Ka-boom!

42:03.074 --> 42:06.276
That was a good, solid thud.

42:06.277 --> 42:09.079
Kind of makes you feel all
warm and fuzzy inside, don't it?

42:10.081 --> 42:12.348
It does.

42:12.349 --> 42:14.084
A good, solid thud,

42:14.085 --> 42:17.721
but once again, it's clearly
a completely different sound

42:17.722 --> 42:19.789
to the sound effect.

42:19.790 --> 42:21.891
I'm looking at the top
at the movie explosion,

42:21.892 --> 42:25.228
and I'm seeing this big,
wide bandwidth of sound.

42:25.229 --> 42:27.464
And I see the C-4,
and I see nothing like that.

42:27.465 --> 42:31.768
I see one sharp impulse, a
little bit of surrounding noise,

42:31.769 --> 42:35.572
but nowhere near the depth and
the range of the movie explosion.

42:35.573 --> 42:38.641
I'm gonna go out on a limb and
say I think that one's busted.

42:38.642 --> 42:39.943
Yep, the contrast

42:39.944 --> 42:42.979
between the real explosions
and the film sound effect

42:42.980 --> 42:44.581
is as clear as a bell.

42:44.606 --> 42:49.506
And that leaves this final movie
myth about as busted as the car.

42:49.531 --> 42:52.231
Let's get out of here
before our shoes get all dirty.
