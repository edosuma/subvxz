01:07.400 --> 01:08.800
JD?

01:09.760 --> 01:11.160
What are you doing here?

01:59.200 --> 02:01.798
-Won't prom be just?
-Oh, how should we act?

02:01.800 --> 02:04.318
God, I bet you're gonna be voted
as prom queen, Heather.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.118
-I'd rather slit my wrists.
-Oh, my God, prom queen?

02:07.120 --> 02:10.078
How embarrassing. Obviously,
you'd decline, right, Heather?

02:10.080 --> 02:12.038
God, Heather.
Did you freebase a stroke this morning?

02:12.040 --> 02:14.038
Of course, I'd decline.
The only thing more powerful

02:14.040 --> 02:15.758
than being
the most popular girl in school

02:15.760 --> 02:18.040
is not caring that I'm the most
popular girl in school.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.278
God, I can't wait to get out of here.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.158
Don't worry,
just a few more weeks and then

02:24.160 --> 02:27.238
the only person from this toilet bowl
you'll have to see is me.

02:27.240 --> 02:31.358
And the rest of these yeasty little
pancake batters will be out of my life.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.998
-Oh, speaking of...
-Did you hear?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.758
Kurt Kelly killed himself last night

02:34.760 --> 02:36.400
while setting up a prom-posal
for Heather Duke.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.760
Oh, hey, Heather.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.040
My son was a...

03:10.960 --> 03:13.320
non-threatening homosexual...

03:14.680 --> 03:16.360
and I loved him.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.720
I loved...

03:21.000 --> 03:24.840
my dead non-threatening gay son.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.840
I just-- I can't.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.760
I know you're sad
but this will be huge for you.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.200
Don't talk to me.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.238
I love your hat.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.238
Oh, Heather.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.800
We wanted to give you this.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.958
An extra-large?
Are you calling me fat?

04:03.960 --> 04:07.840
No. It's Kurt's jersey.
He would have wanted you to have it.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.998
Yes, of course.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.478
Thank you.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.958
He spoke so highly of you.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.398
He would always talk about how smart
and sophisticated you were.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.358
God, you taught him so much.
You did.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.038
He would never have known to use
the word "myriad" without you.

04:22.040 --> 04:25.438
Yeah, and on top of that, he was so
excited to tell you about France.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.998
Now he'll never have the chance.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.838
Tell me what about France?

04:29.840 --> 04:32.278
He was going to invite you
to come with us this summer.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.438
Our family always summers
in the French countryside.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.678
-We have a chateau there.
-Well, it's a little place.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.038
-Just 16 bedrooms.
-Well, that's in the main house.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.638
Kurt had a chateau...
and he never told me?

04:43.640 --> 04:46.478
Well, it's not much but we call it
the Notre Maison.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.878
We just had the stables put in
for Kurt.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.598
He loved to ride and...

04:50.600 --> 04:52.438
Now they'll go unused.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.718
I-- I-- I could still go.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.438
I could use the stables.

04:56.440 --> 05:00.158
No, darling, having you there
would only make us miss Kurt more.

05:00.160 --> 05:03.758
Then maybe you guys could hang back here
and I could go instead?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.598
Like, to help you heal?

05:05.600 --> 05:09.680
That's sweet, darling,
but I need the time to reflect.

05:10.520 --> 05:13.198
Heather, thank you.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.918
For loving our son.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.518
Come on, honey. There's plenty of time
to reflect at the chateau.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.398
Do you think the reflecting pool's
been installed by now?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.160
Bu-- But...

05:28.800 --> 05:31.440
I could have married into
a reflecting pool?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.438
Veronica,

05:36.440 --> 05:40.000
you're squinching your eyebrows in that
way that'll give you elevens. Stop.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.358
It's just...

05:43.360 --> 05:45.078
I keep wondering if JD...

05:45.080 --> 05:47.438
Please. Your boyfriend is a loser.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.038
He couldn't get away
with actually killing someone.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.358
Plus, of course, Kurt killed himself.
All the signs were there.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.158
He was A, boring.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.238
B, white, and C, male.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.078
I mean, what did he have
to live for anymore?

05:59.080 --> 06:02.720
Plus, Heather was such a mega bitch to
him he's probably relieved to be dead.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.400
Heather.

06:15.640 --> 06:19.120
I had my father add ESPN-2
to our cable package in Kurt's honor.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.758
Thank you.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.798
Just look at the bright side, Heather.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.440
Prom is coming up and...
now you have a reason to wear black.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.998
I do look great in black.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.878
-That's so true.
-Yeah.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.798
Hey.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.198
Westerburg has been through so much
this year that, if you think about it,

06:38.200 --> 06:40.678
us going to prom is, like,

06:40.680 --> 06:42.560
the greatest gift we can give.

06:44.120 --> 06:47.478
-It's funny, I remember his last words--
-Veronica. Did you hear?

06:47.480 --> 06:49.278
Polling opened up today
and everyone's saying

06:49.280 --> 06:51.480
you're going to be voted
this year's prom queen.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.918
Petition to cancel prom.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.840
Step right up and sign right here.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.920
Prom is nothing more than a tool
of the patriarchy and must be canceled.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.518
-Yes. Thank you.
-That's right.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.120
-I'll be right back.
-A lefty, I love that.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.958
-Thank you.
-Step right up

07:18.960 --> 07:20.600
to end
this barbaric tradition.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.438
I thought maybe you were right.

08:17.440 --> 08:21.358
Maybe some good
old fashioned normalcy is

08:21.360 --> 08:23.160
exactly what we need.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.120
So you, JD...

08:27.560 --> 08:29.280
are asking me to prom?

08:30.640 --> 08:31.960
Yep.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.038
I thought prom was slavery or corporate
or something?

08:36.039 --> 08:38.038
It is.

08:38.039 --> 08:41.840
But I realized that
after everything we've been through,

08:42.600 --> 08:43.919
we need to do this.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.200
To go to prom.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.120
Together.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.638
Well, I promised Heather and Heather
I'd go with them.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.198
Which would have put me
in a terrible bind.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.638
Do I pick the friends that I hate
or the boyfriend I hate.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.840
The boyfriend you hate.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.440
But now we're never going to know.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.998
Why is that?

09:08.000 --> 09:12.438
Because Heather Chandler just decided
that prom is a tool of the patriarchy

09:12.440 --> 09:14.720
and is about to get
the whole thing cancelled.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.278
-What?
-It's whatever.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.838
I mean, it's just prom.

09:20.840 --> 09:25.240
Why don't we just make out behind the
Snappy Snack Shack all night instead?

09:26.840 --> 09:28.758
Yeah.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.760
-That sounds nice.
-Yeah.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.160
It's just prom.

09:42.280 --> 09:47.038
Which is why, in closing,
I propose changing Westerburg's

09:47.040 --> 09:50.038
Å±restrictive regulation on skirt lengths
at prom.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.798
We should be able to look super-hot
if we want to.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.318
I mean, we shouldn't be telling girls
what they can and can't wear.

09:55.320 --> 09:59.118
Thank you, Shelby.
Eventually, well said.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.878
Prom committee?
Shall we pass this motion?

10:01.880 --> 10:04.678
I don't know, Pauline. I mean,
her skirt is already pretty short.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.438
-She looks like a stripper.
-Thank you.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.518
Won't it be confusing
for the male student body?

10:08.520 --> 10:10.598
Being told you can look
but you can't touch?

10:10.600 --> 10:14.038
Well then, why don't we make every girl
wear a burkah to prom?

10:14.040 --> 10:16.158
-We can't do that.
-Then I think it's settled.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.358
-Back me up here, Maurice.
-Actually, I agree with Pauline.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.038
-You do?
-Of course.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.918
Short skirts are fun. Let the girls
show off them getaway sticks.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.318
I say, if you've got it, flaunt it.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.038
'Cause, honey, before you know it,
them firm thighs

10:30.040 --> 10:33.638
are gonna look like two limp sausages
dipped in wet crepe paper.

10:33.640 --> 10:37.278
Actually, Maurice,
now that I think about it,

10:37.280 --> 10:39.998
I don't want the girls
exploiting themselves.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.158
"Exploiting?" Pauline.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.918
Just because you've never found yourself
ganked up and pantsless

10:44.920 --> 10:48.358
surrounded by 14 men tossing you
quarters in a Big Lots parking lot,

10:48.360 --> 10:50.358
doesn't mean you have to ruin
everybody else's fun.

10:50.360 --> 10:54.800
Okay, I'm just-- I'm trying to just
think things through here.

10:55.920 --> 11:01.958
Okay, young women should wear
what they want,

11:01.960 --> 11:07.798
but they also shouldn't have to cater
to the male gaze just to feel seen.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.558
We have to protect them,
but we also have to empower them.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.598
-What's happening to her?
-I would say it's a hot flash,

11:13.600 --> 11:15.118
but we're way past that.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.518
They need to decide what they want,

11:19.520 --> 11:21.518
but they can't make the wrong decision.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.718
This is like watching
a kale salad catch fire and explode.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.198
Okay, what if the skirts were,
I don't know, two inches shorter?

11:29.200 --> 11:31.918
I don't think that's too distracting.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.520
I have...

11:38.400 --> 11:42.118
It seems empowered.
Two inches feels empowered to me.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.958
But also still fun. Right?

11:43.960 --> 11:46.640
Okay. Thank you, Shelby.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.278
The rule is now changed.

11:49.280 --> 11:53.200
Girls may wear their skirts
two inches higher to prom.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.160
Thank you!

12:01.560 --> 12:04.518
Did you hear? Heather Chandler's
petitioning to cancel prom.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.678
Great.
All in favor of cancelling the prom?

12:06.680 --> 12:08.000
Aye!

12:18.400 --> 12:20.240
Heather. A word.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.880
Hey!

12:24.760 --> 12:26.238
You need to uncancel prom.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.638
I don't need to do anything
but look good and watch you fail.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.798
-Jesus.
-I thought you'd be happy?

12:32.800 --> 12:35.598
Prom is a bourgeois practice

12:35.600 --> 12:38.878
designed to spike profits
at dress stores and blow-out salons.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.678
You are denying your classmates
a key adolescent rite of passage.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.118
No, I'm freeing them
of a social construct

12:45.120 --> 12:47.118
that was created to cause stress

12:47.120 --> 12:49.518
and despair for those on the lower rungs
of the social ladder.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.638
Oh, so the beautiful and popular
have to miss out

12:53.640 --> 12:56.998
because the weak-willed
can't take the heat?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.600
You don't believe a word
you're saying, do you?

13:00.000 --> 13:03.878
-Do you?
-Of course not, but that's my thing.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.678
But you?

13:05.680 --> 13:09.520
Teen Nietzsche is suddenly creaming
his jeans over a school dance?

13:10.920 --> 13:12.400
Why?

13:18.720 --> 13:20.600
Oh, my God.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.320
I know.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.880
You're trying to win back Veronica.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Promise me you won't tell her.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.358
I never thought the day would come
but Veronica finally wised up about you.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.400
Just get it back on, Heather.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.880
Do you know what you are
to Veronica, JD?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.200
You're a plus one.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.758
You're a placeholder.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.280
You're a "who's that" in photos.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.720
Even if you two get your little
romance novel moment at prom,

14:02.480 --> 14:06.758
the minute she's off at college,
you'll be in her rear view.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.598
In just a few months,
she'll be in her dorm room,

14:09.600 --> 14:13.920
laughing at your old texts with
the new guy who's going down on her.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.880
And then when Thanksgiving comes,
and everyone's back in Sherwood,

14:19.840 --> 14:22.120
it's me she'll call.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.840
And we'll go get Slushees,

14:25.720 --> 14:29.598
and that's when she'll excitedly tell me
how she finally found a guy

14:29.600 --> 14:31.520
who could get her off.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.840
Great slash fic, Heather.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.918
Sorry, JD.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.040
Heather and I have spoken.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.800
Prom is as over as you are.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.198
I can almost see some light
peek through my thigh gap now.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.920
It's all about cutting sugars.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.478
What is this?

15:07.480 --> 15:09.518
A receiving line.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.440
Heather Duke is accepting mourning gifts
for Kurt.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.120
Please accept my offering.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.080
And how are you sorry for my loss?

15:41.320 --> 15:44.078
I just wanted to offer my condolences.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.480
I'm sure Kurt's suicide
was a devastating loss for you since...

15:48.760 --> 15:50.520
you seemed to care about him so much.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.158
What do want, knife licker?

15:54.160 --> 15:56.160
I want you to get prom back on.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.480
-Why?
-Veronica.

16:00.760 --> 16:04.518
-You know how much she wants to go.
-Go back to your quarry, forest hermit.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.440
You're keeping my public waiting.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.198
Fine.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.318
I just... figured with Heather Chandler
being so popular again,

16:13.320 --> 16:16.518
-getting prom cancelled and all...
-She's not more popular than me.

16:16.520 --> 16:20.678
-Did you see that line out there, okay?
-They pity you.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.080
But they fear Heather Chandler.

16:24.640 --> 16:29.438
Kurt's death will keep your ball
in the air for a few weeks, maybe.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.718
But then we both know
what's gonna happen.

16:31.720 --> 16:35.600
Tragedy plus time equals waning power.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.158
It's a shame too.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.720
This was probably the one moment
where you actually had a shot.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.840
A shot at what?

16:50.440 --> 16:52.718
Prom queen.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.438
-What?
-You'd be a shoo-in now.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.158
And Heather Duke, as prom queen?

16:59.160 --> 17:02.638
I mean... that would mean something.

17:02.640 --> 17:06.117
It's not like Heather Chandler
where it's just another girl.

17:06.119 --> 17:11.000
No.
You being prom queen...

17:12.160 --> 17:14.440
would be groundbreaking.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.119
At Westerburg, for sure and...

17:19.240 --> 17:20.839
probably all over the country.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.400
But I guess this is...

17:28.600 --> 17:31.838
just another time
when you let Heather Chandler

17:31.840 --> 17:33.320
take away something

17:34.720 --> 17:36.560
that is rightfully yours.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.478
Why did I lobby to reinstate prom?

18:04.480 --> 18:06.278
I wanted to start a conversation.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.398
Being prom queen isn't about gender.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.038
It's about attitude.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.278
All students
should be allowed to partake

18:13.280 --> 18:15.118
in this sacred American tradition.

18:15.120 --> 18:19.238
Whether they're a boy, girl,
or somewhere in-between.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.560
Thank you.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.998
Heather, I'm confused.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.758
You seem like a halfway smart person,

18:28.760 --> 18:30.998
so why are you acting
like a goddamn typo?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.678
Oh, I'm sorry, Heather,
is coming in second place

18:33.680 --> 18:35.880
taking you back to your pageant days?

18:37.720 --> 18:41.998
You think that just because
you aspire to lead that you can?

18:42.000 --> 18:45.918
But leading is more than just basking
in the applause of a grateful public.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.438
You never understood that.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.038
Then how come
I continue to win the hearts

18:49.040 --> 18:52.158
and minds of everyone I encounter?
Tell me, Heather.

18:52.160 --> 18:56.320
Are you really going up against
Westerburg's own Jackie O?

18:57.840 --> 19:00.838
Pride goeth before the fall, Heather.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.560
Did Trailer Parker teach you
that bible quote?

19:05.320 --> 19:06.920
It's my party, Heather.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.360
You're just catering it.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.240
Thank you.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.958
-What's going on, JD?
-Well,

19:26.960 --> 19:29.798
looks like prom
is back on again, so...

19:29.800 --> 19:31.918
I guess now you really do
have a choice.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.840
The Heathers or me.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.998
Okay, so wait, like, last week
prom is enemy of the masses

19:39.000 --> 19:41.078
and now all of a sudden
you're just into it?

19:41.080 --> 19:44.878
Because of you, Veronica.
I know how important it is to you.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.600
That's bullshit, JD.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.960
Did you kill Kurt?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.678
You know what,
I don't even want to know.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.320
I just want you
to stay the hell away from me.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.998
-Veronica--
-And no.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.920
I'm not going to prom with you.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.398
Oh, Veronica.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.440
It turns out it was an actual ghost.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.718
Now I get it. Wow.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.758
It's so easy to confuse them.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.880
Where have you been hiding this one?

20:26.200 --> 20:29.518
So, JD, any thought as to what
you're gonna do after graduation?

20:29.520 --> 20:34.718
Well, I think I'm going to study
early childhood education.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.838
I believe it was Nelson Mandela who
said, "Education is our best weapon."

20:38.840 --> 20:42.838
And I just want to arm
as many children as I can.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.278
Well, I think that's wonderful.
Isn't that wonderful, Kevin?

20:46.280 --> 20:49.078
You know, I can't get
these damn blinds down.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.678
Tell me again why I automated
these things?

20:50.680 --> 20:53.838
-'Cause you're an idiot, Dad.
-No, Veronica.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.598
That's not it.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.040
You two.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.038
Have you applied
to any colleges yet, JD?

21:00.040 --> 21:01.518
Oberlin.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.998
Oberlin. You know,
that's across the state.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.678
Don't you think
you're gonna need a car?

21:05.680 --> 21:08.198
Well, I have a new car now,
Veronica.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.918
-What happened to the old car?
-Oh, it just overheated.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.798
You know, Mrs. Sawyer,
this spaghetti is so wonderful.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.718
It's perfectly <i> al dente.</i>

21:15.720 --> 21:17.318
Extra oregano.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.998
I bet you haven't had a home-cooked meal

21:19.000 --> 21:20.838
-in a long time, JD.
-Why not?

21:20.840 --> 21:23.918
-Kevin.
-What? What did I say?

21:23.920 --> 21:26.160
JD's mother is no longer with us.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.518
I'm so sorry about that.

21:29.520 --> 21:33.598
If you don't mind my asking,
what happened there?

21:33.600 --> 21:37.840
Well,
my mother was a very troubled woman.

21:39.320 --> 21:42.158
In every life, a little rain must fall.

21:42.160 --> 21:45.798
Exactly.
And at least I found my rainbow.

21:45.800 --> 21:49.038
Oh, that's sweet.
Isn't that sweet, Kevin?

21:49.040 --> 21:52.358
There we go.
Now, where's that pÃ¢tÃ©?

21:52.360 --> 21:53.998
We're all out.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.118
Can't keep it in the house now that
Veronica's developed a taste for it.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.360
Well, she is insatiable.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.518
I think I'll just go get some more.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.558
-Why don't I go?
-Oh, are you sure?

22:04.560 --> 22:06.798
-Of course.
-Well, why don't I go with you?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.838
No, Veronica. You stay here.

22:08.840 --> 22:12.478
Why don't you tell your parents
our Will and Kate story.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.838
That one is so romantic.

22:14.840 --> 22:17.598
I love the royal family!

22:17.600 --> 22:18.960
She really does.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.558
He seems like such a nice boy.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.238
Just the kind of influence
you need right now.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.160
I can see you two together.
Cute babies.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.160
Menthols! And a foot long!

23:03.200 --> 23:05.158
Even the most
privileged of American teens

23:05.160 --> 23:08.438
still need their daily fix
of processed meat products.

23:08.440 --> 23:12.118
Just because you helped me doesn't mean
you get to speak to me in public.

23:12.120 --> 23:16.598
Fine. Doesn't look like they have pÃ¢tÃ©
at the Snappy Snack Shack anyways.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.078
PÃ¢tÃ©?

23:18.080 --> 23:20.798
At a convenience store in Ohio?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.318
God, you're a worse trust fund baby
than me.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.998
Convenience stores have come
a long way, okay?

23:26.000 --> 23:29.198
This one has sushi, lattes.

23:29.200 --> 23:33.680
And look at the myriad of condiment
options for your delicious hot dogs.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.800
What did you say?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.240
About condiments?

23:43.240 --> 23:45.598
The myriad of condiment options?

23:45.600 --> 23:47.200
For your delicious hot dogs.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.918
Wait, where's my Slushee?
And where's my dog?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.478
No time to explain, we have to go now.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.158
-Go get my stuff.
-Jade, listen to me.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.598
There is a teenage Charles Manson
in that convenience store

24:21.600 --> 24:25.158
who's going to slit my throat if
you don't let me in this car right now.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.678
Wait, so you're telling me
that someone's trying to kill you?

24:28.680 --> 24:31.678
-Yes!
-And if he succeeds, you'd be dead?

24:31.680 --> 24:35.118
Oh, my God, has all that spray tan
and domestic beer rotted your brain?

24:35.120 --> 24:38.960
-Yes!
-Okay. Hold on.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.638
Jade!?

24:45.640 --> 24:49.560
Oh, my God. Okay.
Oh, my God. Okay, think. Think.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.240
One-minute wait?

24:55.400 --> 24:56.960
Goddamn it.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.438
<i>Nine-one-one, what is your emergency?</i>

25:00.440 --> 25:03.358
Yes. Hi. There is a killer
in the Snappy Snack Shack.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.878
He just used the word "myriad"
which is the same word my ex

25:05.880 --> 25:08.678
never would have been smart enough to
use in his so-called suicide note!

25:08.680 --> 25:12.438
<i>Oh, is that right? There's a killer</i>
<i>at the Snappy Snack Shack?</i>

25:12.440 --> 25:14.478
Wow, that must be so scary.

25:14.480 --> 25:17.038
Whatever are you going to do?
I know who you are.

25:17.040 --> 25:20.358
You're that punk-ass kid
that keeps prank calling here.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.918
Oops.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.518
Hello, 911, I'd like to report
a crime on top of Veronica's head.

25:25.520 --> 25:29.958
Nine-one-one. I'd like to report
an unsolved accident from 17 years ago.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.478
Her name is Trailer Parker and her
parents could not have wanted this.

25:33.480 --> 25:37.198
Nine-one-one. Shelby Dunnstock
has a French manicure on her toes

25:37.200 --> 25:39.280
and she's wearing jelly shoes.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.838
Fuck the police!

25:43.840 --> 25:46.478
Heather. What's going on?

25:46.480 --> 25:48.680
You killed Kurt, you piece of shit.

25:51.360 --> 25:55.718
What's going on is I'm taking this car
directly to the goddamn police station.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.160
Drive!

25:59.680 --> 26:02.398
Hey, I'm Dathan, I've got some mints
in the console if you need them.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.678
Shut up and listen to me very closely.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.878
That human red flag over there
killed my ex

26:06.880 --> 26:09.198
and he knows that I know
which means he won't sleep

26:09.200 --> 26:10.998
until we're both dead in a gutter.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.758
So, we're about to
embark on a death race

26:12.760 --> 26:14.598
through this godforsaken podunk town

26:14.600 --> 26:17.918
which means I need you to drive
like your miserable life depends on it

26:17.920 --> 26:20.318
because quite frankly it does.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.478
-Well, today's your lucky day.
-Why?

26:22.480 --> 26:26.000
'Cause I just chugged two Red Bulls and
this morning I forgot to take my meds.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.640
-He's gaining on us.
-I got this.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.840
Go. Just go!

27:26.840 --> 27:30.080
-Help me out.
-Gladly. This one is for Kurt.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.680
I was the one who was supposed
to destroy Kurt, you piece of shit!

27:40.840 --> 27:43.158
You stupid fuck.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.600
You goddamn bitch!

27:49.680 --> 27:51.638
-Who's Kurt?
-My boyfriend. He's dead.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.680
Long story.
Police station's that way.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.000
Three o'clock.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.640
I think we lost him.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.520
-Little help?
-There.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.280
Where's that asshole going?

29:08.120 --> 29:09.640
We got trouble.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.400
Later days, Strawberry Shortcake.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.960
-This might sting a little.
-I trust you implicitly.

29:47.080 --> 29:50.478
Give me that, give me that!
You are the best driver in the world!

29:50.480 --> 29:52.238
-Thank you.
-As a reward I will allow you

29:52.240 --> 29:55.238
to tell me one, and I mean only one,
thing about your personal life.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.718
Okay.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.518
I'm working on this novel
about a centaur

29:59.520 --> 30:01.920
-and he lives in a lighthouse.
-Oh, shit!

30:40.160 --> 30:43.478
I hate to do this, Dathan,
but you did wreck, so...

30:43.480 --> 30:44.800
Three stars.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.798
You'll never get away with this.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.880
I'm very popular and very white.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.560
Enjoy jail, psycho.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.000
Gross.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.798
Couldn't have killed you better myself.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.280
JD...

32:15.160 --> 32:16.718
Come closer.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.640
I have something important to tell you.

32:32.440 --> 32:34.678
Tell your Mom
to spit out the devil's jizz

32:34.680 --> 32:36.800
before you tongue kiss her in hell.

33:36.240 --> 33:40.438
Well, I had to go to five stores
but I finally found some pÃ¢tÃ©.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.918
Oh, bless your heart.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.758
You didn't have to go
through all that trouble.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.960
Well, it was no trouble at all.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.480
Who was it this time, JD?

34:09.080 --> 34:10.560
I had no choice.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.800
Did you have a choice with Kurt?

34:18.560 --> 34:19.960
Jesus Christ.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.880
Are we going to prom or to hell?

34:30.440 --> 34:31.760
Hello?

34:50.480 --> 34:53.600
-Veronica, listen...
-You don't even deserve hell.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.320
God, Heather...

35:20.760 --> 35:23.040
You would hate how they did your makeup.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.600
There.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.200
That's your best angle.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.560
I miss you already, Heather.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.600
Okay.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.720
Bye.

36:29.840 --> 36:32.598
I mean, should we even go to prom now?

36:32.600 --> 36:36.358
I don't know. I mean, I don't think
Heather would want us to go.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.678
She got mad when we went to the bathroom
without her.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.638
Yeah, she'd probably want us
to be totally tragic

36:42.640 --> 36:44.278
for at least a month.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.038
-Yeah.
-Heather.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.798
Did you hear? Everyone's saying
now that Heather's dead,

36:48.800 --> 36:50.520
you're going to be the new prom queen.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.120
Well, I wish it were under
better circumstances, but...

36:57.920 --> 36:59.758
If it's what the people want,

36:59.760 --> 37:01.918
it's what the people want.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.760
-Thank you, Peter.
-Of course.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.880
Heather.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.400
You're beautiful.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.280
Like you wouldn't do
the exact same thing.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.640
Come on, Veronica.

37:20.440 --> 37:25.478
We can get you a silver dress
now that Heather's not going.

37:25.480 --> 37:26.840
Grow up, Heather.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.800
Babe?

37:33.240 --> 37:34.800
Better late than never, right?

37:35.520 --> 37:39.078
Look, Veronica, I'm sorry.
Okay?

37:39.080 --> 37:41.520
Just tell me what you want.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.680
You know what I want?

37:46.960 --> 37:49.158
Cool kids like you

37:49.160 --> 37:50.760
out of my life.
