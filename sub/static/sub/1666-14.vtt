00:00.537 --> 00:01.706
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:01.706 --> 00:04.733
Our community is under attack.

00:04.734 --> 00:06.103
They're
declaring war on us.

00:06.105 --> 00:07.623
All his life,
there's only ever been

00:07.624 --> 00:09.124
one man he has
truly feared...

00:09.125 --> 00:10.826
My father Mikael.

00:10.827 --> 00:11.794
All we need is a witch

00:11.795 --> 00:12.928
who could help us
find him.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.862
- Celeste.
- How did you know?

00:14.864 --> 00:16.297
If you have come here
seeking revenge...

00:16.299 --> 00:17.716
Oh, I'll have
my revenge,

00:17.717 --> 00:18.783
starting with Klaus.

00:18.784 --> 00:20.803
He is gonna know
pain and torment

00:20.804 --> 00:22.254
like he's never
felt before.

00:22.255 --> 00:25.307
Then that leaves Rebekah,
your tragic sister.

00:25.308 --> 00:26.458
She's about
to find herself

00:26.459 --> 00:27.976
in quite
the predicament.

00:28.402 --> 00:30.113
Genevieve knows
where your sister is,

00:30.279 --> 00:31.463
Bastiana has Klaus

00:31.464 --> 00:32.898
tucked away
someplace safe.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.243
I guess always isn't
forever after all.

Who's there?

02:15.751 --> 02:17.618
How the hell did I get here?

02:33.268 --> 02:36.521
Genevieve.

02:36.522 --> 02:37.973
Rebekah.

02:37.974 --> 02:40.142
Tell me you're not
leaving already.

02:40.143 --> 02:41.953
I thought we
might reminisce.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.092
Aah!

03:43.222 --> 03:45.790
My siblings have been taken.
Where are they?

03:45.792 --> 03:48.559
You're interrupting
my aunt Sophie's consecration.

03:53.632 --> 03:54.776
How did this happen?

03:55.051 --> 03:57.269
Aunt Sophie was
a casualty of war.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.603
Monique, I recommend
you give me

03:58.604 --> 03:59.938
what I want,
unless, of course,

03:59.939 --> 04:01.356
you'd like me
to level this place

04:01.357 --> 04:02.774
and everything in it.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.475
That won't
be necessary.

04:05.527 --> 04:08.063
I have a message
for you...

04:08.064 --> 04:09.363
From Celeste.

04:25.881 --> 04:27.966
To find what
you're looking for,

04:27.967 --> 04:30.770
follow the path
she left behind.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.422
What the hell are you
doing, you ruthless bitch?

05:07.423 --> 05:09.173
Poor Rebekah.

05:10.525 --> 05:12.020
You should rest.

05:12.428 --> 05:14.095
You're looking
a little peaked.

05:16.982 --> 05:18.966
Uhh! Ow!

05:18.968 --> 05:21.238
Of course, that's
to be expected,

05:21.404 --> 05:22.921
given the rather
impressive amount of

05:22.922 --> 05:24.616
werewolf venom
in your system.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.527
How did you like that wolf-boy,
by the way?

05:28.528 --> 05:30.705
I thought he seemed
like your type...

05:30.980 --> 05:32.147
Trashy and willing.

05:32.148 --> 05:33.315
If I weren't
so bloody sick,

05:33.316 --> 05:34.501
I'd rip
your head off.

05:34.784 --> 05:36.336
But you are sick.

05:36.619 --> 05:38.236
And comforting
the sick always was

05:38.237 --> 05:39.454
a talent of mine.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.541
I take care
of my friends.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.179
We were friends,
weren't we?

05:50.248 --> 05:51.499
Of course we were.

05:57.731 --> 05:59.056
There, there.

06:01.676 --> 06:03.811
Unidentified
sick man.

06:06.315 --> 06:07.659
That can't be good.

06:09.267 --> 06:10.818
You. Red.

06:18.527 --> 06:21.256
Here. Try to take
a sip of this.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.670
Hmm. Just like magic.

06:28.671 --> 06:30.372
But then again,
what would you expect

06:30.373 --> 06:32.206
from a practicing
witch?

06:34.676 --> 06:36.187
It's a simple
herbal remedy.

06:36.546 --> 06:39.047
Won't stop the inevitable,
but it should

06:39.048 --> 06:40.882
ease his pain
and quiet his lungs.

06:40.883 --> 06:42.527
For a while,
at least.

06:42.852 --> 06:45.003
You're quite good
at this, miss...

06:45.004 --> 06:46.972
What is your
name again?

06:46.973 --> 06:48.283
Genevieve.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.525
Lovely.

06:50.526 --> 06:52.360
Perhaps you could
give me some pointers.

06:52.361 --> 06:55.373
Certainly. Though it is a bit odd.

06:57.181 --> 06:59.502
A vampire serving
as nurse.

06:59.668 --> 07:02.237
Please, darling,
I'm an original vampire.

07:02.238 --> 07:03.788
If my city
is under attack

07:03.789 --> 07:04.940
from this
nasty influenza,

07:04.941 --> 07:06.791
it is my duty
to lend a hand.

07:06.792 --> 07:09.878
Besides, if this
entire lot dies,

07:09.879 --> 07:11.222
who'd be left
to eat?

07:11.388 --> 07:13.664
You're wicked.

07:14.883 --> 07:16.034
You know, I think
you and I

07:16.035 --> 07:18.104
are going to be
fast friends.

07:18.537 --> 07:20.388
What say you
join me at this

07:20.389 --> 07:21.756
swell, little
jazz joint

07:21.757 --> 07:23.558
I've discovered on
basin street tonight?

07:23.559 --> 07:25.342
We can toast to
the health of New Orleans.

07:29.231 --> 07:32.327
Oh... I don't know.

07:35.070 --> 07:37.207
You. You should
come, too.

07:37.556 --> 07:39.390
After playing angels
of mercy all day,

07:39.391 --> 07:41.025
I'd say we all
deserve some fun.

07:47.866 --> 07:48.885
Uhh.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.748
Anything?

08:03.749 --> 08:05.634
They're putting eyes
and ears out everywhere.

08:05.635 --> 08:07.612
Daywalkers are working
every contact we got.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.688
Cops, dock workers,
guys in the treme.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.805
Word is out.

08:10.806 --> 08:12.274
Anyone trying to
earn favor with me

08:12.275 --> 08:14.192
gets a lifetime of
it if they find them.

08:14.193 --> 08:15.745
Good. I need
a pen and paper.

08:17.195 --> 08:18.456
Hey.

08:18.864 --> 08:20.865
Am I taking orders
from you now?

08:20.866 --> 08:22.701
Or are we
in this together?

08:22.702 --> 08:26.131
Pen and paper, Marcel.
Now.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.291
Look, I want her back just
as much as you do, you know.

08:29.292 --> 08:30.791
Both of them.

08:35.330 --> 08:37.164
Hayley!

08:37.166 --> 08:39.551
Elijah. You're back.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.719
Did you find any... thing?

08:45.256 --> 08:46.473
What is happening?

08:46.475 --> 08:48.425
I need you to make
a list of these names.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.644
Please.

08:54.015 --> 08:55.316
Ok.

09:10.090 --> 09:12.984
Sabine...?
Elijah, what is this?

09:12.985 --> 09:14.753
I believe they
represent the names

09:14.754 --> 09:16.204
of the women that
Celeste inhabited

09:16.205 --> 09:17.455
for the past
two centuries.

09:17.456 --> 09:18.673
It's called a devinette.

09:18.674 --> 09:20.425
It's old school.
Kind of a riddle.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.326
Witches use them
to teach their kids.

09:22.327 --> 09:24.011
Solve it
and it disappears.

09:24.013 --> 09:26.381
Why?
What's the point?

09:26.382 --> 09:27.765
Celeste forced me to make a choice

09:27.766 --> 09:29.017
between yourself
and my siblings,

09:29.018 --> 09:30.885
and now she means
to mock that choice,

09:30.886 --> 09:32.003
taunting me

09:32.004 --> 09:33.555
with a childish
game.

09:33.556 --> 09:36.057
The longer the game,
the more they suffer.

09:36.058 --> 09:38.676
To find Klaus
and Rebekah,

09:38.677 --> 09:40.862
we need to solve
this riddle.

09:40.863 --> 09:43.698
The solution lies
somewhere in these names.

09:43.699 --> 09:45.699
The name next to
Sabine... Annie LaFleur.

09:47.452 --> 09:48.820
She's a witch that was
shunned from her coven

09:48.821 --> 09:49.954
just over a year ago.

09:49.955 --> 09:51.716
Never knew why,
but I can find out.

10:11.676 --> 10:13.677
You poor thing.

10:19.934 --> 10:23.020
Don't worry.
I'm here to help.

10:53.665 --> 10:55.478
Annie was
a good girl.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.749
Witches done her wrong,
shunning her like that,

10:58.750 --> 11:01.319
saying that she's doing
dark magic.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.872
There's no way.
But they had proof.

11:05.038 --> 11:09.093
So, she just quit.

11:09.094 --> 11:12.763
And I can't really
blame her for that.

11:12.764 --> 11:14.849
Because once you've
been shunned,

11:14.850 --> 11:17.133
what's the point
of going on, you know?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.005
She killed herself?

11:21.006 --> 11:22.273
Yes.
Drowned herself

11:22.274 --> 11:24.192
in the Mississippi,
to be precise.

11:24.193 --> 11:25.526
Celeste had clearly
tired of the body

11:25.527 --> 11:27.060
and was ready
to take Sabine's.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.362
How do you know that?

11:28.363 --> 11:30.615
She leapt to her death
from the very location

11:30.616 --> 11:32.567
Celeste and I had
our first kiss.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.535
Poetic, I guess,
in a creepy,

11:34.536 --> 11:35.870
vendetta kind of way.

11:36.236 --> 11:37.738
All these names,
these lives,

11:37.739 --> 11:39.790
stolen that Celeste
might take her revenge.

11:39.791 --> 11:40.908
I suppose
we have no choice

11:40.909 --> 11:42.793
but to see where
they take us.

11:42.794 --> 11:44.912
Hayley, I have to go.
I'll call you back.

11:44.913 --> 11:45.955
Elijah, wait.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.881
What is it?

11:50.718 --> 11:52.536
Ask Marcel if
he knows anything

11:52.537 --> 11:56.373
about a name on that list...
Brynne Deveraux.

11:56.374 --> 11:58.593
Sophie said that it was
her family's bloodline

11:58.594 --> 12:00.144
that put the curse on
the crescent wolves,

12:00.145 --> 12:02.013
but Celeste said that
she was the only one

12:02.014 --> 12:03.212
that could break it.

12:03.214 --> 12:05.099
If Brynne Deveraux
was actually Celeste

12:05.100 --> 12:06.901
when she cast
the spell, then

12:06.902 --> 12:09.062
maybe Celeste can
still break it.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.980
I'll see
what he knows.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.108
Elijah, I'm really sorry

12:14.109 --> 12:15.692
that you're going
through this.

12:16.827 --> 12:18.613
If I had known that
Celeste had made you

12:18.614 --> 12:19.914
choose who to help...

12:19.915 --> 12:21.449
You were going to
die in that fire, Hayley,

12:21.450 --> 12:22.949
along with my
brother's child.

12:24.418 --> 12:25.919
There was no choice.

12:33.678 --> 12:35.963
My wound isn't healing.

12:36.129 --> 12:38.181
The amount of dark magic
contained in that blade?

12:38.183 --> 12:39.683
It's gonna take
a little while.

12:39.685 --> 12:41.334
You're one of them,
aren't you?

12:42.303 --> 12:44.514
The witches
back from the dead,

12:44.680 --> 12:46.849
seeking vengeance.

12:47.015 --> 12:48.725
Why show me kindness?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.691
You never did
anything to me.

12:54.857 --> 12:58.102
And the truth is,
seeing you like this,

12:58.103 --> 13:00.279
I can't help
but pity you.

13:00.445 --> 13:03.741
Then betray the others
and stand with me.

13:04.042 --> 13:06.210
I will reward you

13:06.211 --> 13:09.329
in ways you cannot
possibly fathom.

13:11.849 --> 13:14.168
Klaus Mikaelson
offering a deal

13:14.553 --> 13:16.170
to little ol' me?

13:16.336 --> 13:18.088
I should be flattered.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.760
But first... we need
to have a talk

13:22.761 --> 13:24.227
about your sister.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.850
Rebekah is of
no concern to you.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.935
If you mean
to harm her...

13:31.101 --> 13:33.396
Ah, the protective brother.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.822
A shame that loyalty
isn't reciprocated.

13:36.657 --> 13:38.159
But then,
I'm no stranger

13:38.160 --> 13:39.492
to Rebekah's treachery.

13:40.995 --> 13:43.079
Something you and I
have in common.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.866
Here. Drink.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.323
I'm just trying
to help you.

13:52.324 --> 13:56.344
Heal you. Get you to see the truth

13:56.345 --> 13:57.678
that's been right
in front of you

13:57.679 --> 13:59.255
for almost
a century.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.011
Your sister had
an unfortunate run-in

14:14.012 --> 14:15.196
with some wolves
last night.

14:15.197 --> 14:16.697
I imagine you're
tasting the venom

14:16.698 --> 14:17.982
in her blood.

14:19.349 --> 14:20.451
It's the only way
I can show you

14:20.452 --> 14:21.736
what you need to see.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.211
In her weakened state,
I'll be able to guide her

14:30.212 --> 14:32.463
down memory Lane.

14:32.464 --> 14:34.582
That's how I'm going
to have my revenge.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.668
By showing you
her betrayal.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.341
Niklaus.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.741
Marcel.
Have some respect.

15:17.742 --> 15:20.427
Yeah, I don't
think they mind.

15:25.099 --> 15:27.383
Did you ask Genevieve
about doing the spell?

15:28.585 --> 15:32.273
I will.
When the time is right.

15:32.274 --> 15:34.308
Rebekah.
You've been hanging around

15:34.309 --> 15:35.860
that witch for weeks,
waiting for the time

15:35.861 --> 15:37.261
to be right.

15:37.262 --> 15:39.612
She wasn't supposed
to become your sidekick.

15:41.782 --> 15:44.784
One little spell and we could
finally be together for real.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.705
What are you
waiting for?

15:47.988 --> 15:50.374
She's a sweet girl,
is all.

15:50.375 --> 15:53.127
If you must know, I feel
badly for using her.

15:53.128 --> 15:54.611
Then we'll find
another witch,

15:54.612 --> 15:56.579
one you don't have
to fake a friendship with.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.470
Unless you've changed
your mind.

16:06.390 --> 16:09.226
I want to wake up
with you in our home,

16:09.227 --> 16:11.053
in the bed
that we share.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.980
I want to walk down
the street with you by my side

16:13.982 --> 16:15.483
so that everyone knows
that you are mine

16:15.484 --> 16:16.649
and I am yours.

16:17.736 --> 16:18.788
I don't want
to be afraid

16:18.789 --> 16:20.006
of what my brother
will do to me

16:20.007 --> 16:21.397
for loving you.

16:22.825 --> 16:24.826
If this is the only way
to get it, then...

16:26.745 --> 16:28.513
No, my mind
hasn't changed.

16:43.446 --> 16:46.949
Oh! I didn't know
anyone was in here.

16:47.255 --> 16:48.254
I'm so sorry.

16:50.286 --> 16:51.453
Genevieve...

16:53.289 --> 16:54.540
Genevieve, wait...

17:00.379 --> 17:01.546
I'm sorry.

17:03.332 --> 17:05.441
So, this is your
great betrayal.

17:05.919 --> 17:07.553
My sister and Marcel.

17:07.554 --> 17:09.338
They've been sneaking around
behind my back

17:09.339 --> 17:11.891
for the better part
of two centuries.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.409
Yes. Against all
your warnings.

17:15.795 --> 17:17.512
You'd disciplined
them for it before,

17:17.513 --> 17:19.781
had you not?

17:19.782 --> 17:21.901
Harshly,
I understand.

17:21.902 --> 17:23.469
I had my reasons.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.377
Oh, you don't have
to convince me.

17:26.989 --> 17:28.357
As far as
I'm concerned,

17:28.358 --> 17:29.741
you only needed one:

17:31.677 --> 17:33.094
That it suited you.

17:36.198 --> 17:38.867
Have you ever read
the old testament, Nik?

17:40.036 --> 17:44.438
You see...
God wasn't powerful

17:44.604 --> 17:46.091
because he was right...

17:48.191 --> 17:51.129
He was right
because he was powerful.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.551
I don't know what
you're playing at,

17:55.552 --> 17:57.336
but if the sum total
of your plan

17:57.337 --> 17:58.721
to turn me
against my sister

17:59.119 --> 18:00.389
was this revelation,

18:00.787 --> 18:03.542
this will have been
a wholly ineffective endeavor.

18:03.543 --> 18:05.251
You poor thing.

18:05.529 --> 18:07.146
After 1,000 years,

18:07.147 --> 18:08.514
dishonesty from
your family

18:08.515 --> 18:10.065
has come
to be expected.

18:11.317 --> 18:12.868
I wish that was

18:12.869 --> 18:15.738
the sum total
of their treachery.

18:15.739 --> 18:17.655
Unfortunately, it's not.

18:32.138 --> 18:33.972
W-what do you want
from me?

18:37.365 --> 18:39.095
Well, I assume
you're familiar

18:39.096 --> 18:41.230
with this pigsty,

18:41.231 --> 18:44.248
quite appropriately
known as the pit.

18:44.551 --> 18:47.319
See, awkwardly enough,
only weeks ago,

18:47.320 --> 18:49.462
a group of human beings
just like yourself

18:49.628 --> 18:51.157
slaughtered many of
the companions

18:51.158 --> 18:53.692
of the vampires that
you see assembled

18:53.693 --> 18:54.925
before you here.

18:55.362 --> 18:57.246
You run
the records room at city hall.

18:57.247 --> 18:59.415
We're told the former mayor
kept a detailed record

18:59.416 --> 19:01.400
of the supernatural
community.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.919
A ledger of names of witches,
werewolves, and vampires.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.338
Specifically, their
death records.

19:06.339 --> 19:07.188
We need it.

19:07.758 --> 19:09.175
I-I don't know
where it is.

19:09.176 --> 19:10.676
I think we both
know that's a fib.

19:10.677 --> 19:12.318
Anyone feeling hungry?

19:12.596 --> 19:15.321
Oh! Ok. W-wait.

19:17.280 --> 19:21.103
They moved the records.
After the mayor died.

19:21.104 --> 19:24.473
They're at the sacristy
of St. Anne's church.

19:24.474 --> 19:27.859
See? There.

19:29.928 --> 19:31.780
Wasn't so difficult,
now, was it?

19:43.890 --> 19:45.877
Aah!

19:51.050 --> 19:52.250
Rough day?

19:53.636 --> 19:55.444
Oh, becks.

19:55.610 --> 19:58.030
Those bites are
looking nasty.

19:58.308 --> 20:03.536
Why make me
relive the past?

20:03.702 --> 20:04.979
We both know
how it ends.

20:04.981 --> 20:06.798
You and I both know.

20:06.799 --> 20:09.852
But I thought your brother
might like to hear our story.

20:09.853 --> 20:12.738
So, I linked
your mind to his.

20:12.739 --> 20:14.490
You're gonna
show him everything.

20:14.491 --> 20:18.092
No. No, please don't do that to me.
I'll do anything.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.745
It's too late, friend.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.700
Aah!

20:51.666 --> 20:54.302
Marcel, here's another
name from our list.

20:54.303 --> 20:55.685
Brynne Deveraux.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.555
Says here she drowned herself
some 20 years ago.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.257
Do you recognize
the name?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.392
Brynne? Yeah.
Yeah, we used to hang out.

21:01.393 --> 21:02.510
Knock around a bit.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.961
You can spare me
the details, please.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.514
She used to do some spells
for me now and then.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.931
Girl had power.

21:09.150 --> 21:10.651
Cursed a whole pack
of werewolves

21:10.652 --> 21:12.737
just because they
were pissing me off.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.189
Speaking of...
What do you think

21:15.190 --> 21:16.640
Klaus is gonna do
when he finds out

21:16.641 --> 21:18.309
that you left him
to suffer

21:18.310 --> 21:20.077
while you saved Hayley
and her wolf friends?

21:20.078 --> 21:21.412
Let's avoid discussing
matters that are

21:21.413 --> 21:23.164
not your concern,
shall we, Marcellus?

21:23.165 --> 21:25.533
Oh, come on, Elijah.
I got guys all over this city.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.917
You honestly think
that I don't know

21:26.918 --> 21:28.412
that the crescent
wolves had a little

21:28.578 --> 21:31.822
family reunion out at
the plantation last night?

21:31.823 --> 21:34.175
Thanks for letting the house burn,
by the way.

21:34.176 --> 21:35.169
Good riddance.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.338
But my question is,

21:37.504 --> 21:39.063
what's Hayley doing
with that bunch?

21:39.064 --> 21:40.381
Marcel, I'm aware
of your history

21:40.382 --> 21:41.966
with the city's wolves,
and I assume

21:41.967 --> 21:44.435
you understand that if you
lay a finger upon Hayley,

21:44.436 --> 21:46.603
it will be the last
thing you do on this earth.

21:48.055 --> 21:49.439
I see I hit a nerve.

21:50.691 --> 21:52.475
And just when we
were getting along.

21:53.937 --> 21:54.980
We were right.

21:56.197 --> 21:57.848
Every name
upon my flesh signifies

21:57.849 --> 22:00.034
a witch who died
by her own hand.

22:00.035 --> 22:01.702
All but one.

22:01.703 --> 22:03.072
Clara Summerlin.

22:04.155 --> 22:05.622
Ring any bells?

22:05.624 --> 22:07.524
None.
Ok, well,

22:07.525 --> 22:08.626
if she didn't
off herself,

22:08.627 --> 22:09.677
then how'd she die?

22:09.678 --> 22:12.045
Influenza.
Epidemic of 1919.

22:27.044 --> 22:28.555
I suppose we have
our answer.

22:30.714 --> 22:32.649
Only I have no idea
what it means.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.596
No.

23:05.433 --> 23:08.885
No! Please! Uhh!

23:15.810 --> 23:17.528
Your sister's tryst
with Marcel

23:17.529 --> 23:18.895
was only
the beginning.

23:19.980 --> 23:23.284
You see, the burden
of your condemnation

23:23.285 --> 23:24.902
had become
too great.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.988
And as a result,
your deepest fear came to pass.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.206
That their love
for each other

23:29.207 --> 23:31.826
would overshadow
their love for you,

23:31.827 --> 23:33.829
turn it into hate.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.163
Nik, they conspired

23:36.164 --> 23:38.298
to rid themselves
of you for good.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.472
Yeah!

23:51.638 --> 23:52.980
An abomination
of nature?

23:52.981 --> 23:54.183
You're anything but.

24:00.187 --> 24:01.805
Ok, next round's
on me.

24:01.806 --> 24:04.525
Clara Summerlin, no.
I'll be soused.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.743
Get it while you can.
It's the last

24:06.027 --> 24:07.446
real gin in the city.

24:12.533 --> 24:13.700
Bartender?

24:16.788 --> 24:18.122
You're nothing like
I thought you'd be

24:18.123 --> 24:19.840
when I first met you.

24:19.841 --> 24:23.627
I was brought up to think
your kind were... well...

24:23.628 --> 24:24.922
An abomination of nature?

24:25.263 --> 24:28.549
You're anything bug

24:28.550 --> 24:31.434
not just you,
your whole family is so...

24:34.855 --> 24:36.183
Elegant.

24:36.349 --> 24:39.360
Yes, I agree.
Elijah is quite peerless.

24:39.361 --> 24:42.112
I don't know.
I mean, he's nice and all, but

24:42.113 --> 24:44.564
if I had to go
for one Mikaelson boy...

24:46.283 --> 24:47.111
Klaus?

24:48.703 --> 24:49.954
Genevieve, who'd
have thought

24:49.955 --> 24:51.705
a saintly, little
witch like you

24:51.706 --> 24:53.367
would go for
the bad boys?

24:54.492 --> 24:56.459
I knew we were
destined to be friends.

24:59.163 --> 25:00.582
More gin, please.

25:03.133 --> 25:03.961
Please.

25:05.219 --> 25:06.386
Allow me.

25:14.094 --> 25:15.979
Keep it.
It's yours.

25:20.384 --> 25:22.436
Well, there's a load
of us Mikaelsons.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.071
If you like bad
boys, you'd love

25:24.072 --> 25:25.482
my brother Kol.

25:27.241 --> 25:29.695
And where is this
mystery brother of yours?

25:29.861 --> 25:32.563
It's complicated.

25:32.564 --> 25:34.415
Like all siblings,
we've had our

25:34.416 --> 25:35.833
ups and downs.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.083
Family feuds.

25:39.403 --> 25:41.705
In fact, I was
thinking of

25:41.706 --> 25:43.290
reaching out to
someone we haven't seen

25:43.291 --> 25:44.924
in a very
long while.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.329
I was hoping that
maybe you could

25:48.330 --> 25:49.798
help me contact them.

25:50.148 --> 25:52.600
But it would have
to be a surprise.

25:52.601 --> 25:54.553
No one could know.

25:55.386 --> 25:56.920
Of course.

25:56.921 --> 25:58.388
Do you want me to find
your brother Kol?

26:01.425 --> 26:03.604
Actually, I'd like
you to find Mikael.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.779
Our father.

26:05.780 --> 26:07.931
Enough of your lies!

26:07.932 --> 26:09.967
Don't dismember
the messenger.

26:09.968 --> 26:11.886
Part of you
must have known.

26:11.887 --> 26:13.655
Suspected, at least.

26:15.789 --> 26:17.274
Your father came
to New Orleans

26:17.275 --> 26:20.811
in 1919 to kill you,
did he not?

26:20.812 --> 26:23.580
And as the city burned,
he nearly succeeded.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.519
My family and I have done

26:28.520 --> 26:31.673
some terrible things to
each other over the years,

26:32.057 --> 26:35.475
but Rebekah would not
call my father.

26:38.646 --> 26:40.933
No matter how angry she was.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.519
It's sweet of you
to believe that.

26:44.818 --> 26:47.321
To believe in her.

26:47.322 --> 26:48.906
But by the time
we're done here,

26:48.907 --> 26:50.707
you'll know just
how wrong you are.

27:05.108 --> 27:06.974
Hey, look,
I found...

27:08.443 --> 27:10.996
You were right about
the Deveraux witch.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.949
Find anything about
Clara the mystery witch?

27:13.950 --> 27:15.867
Not much.
She was a nurse

27:15.868 --> 27:17.985
at the Fleur-de-lis
sanitorium.

27:19.905 --> 27:20.955
Recognize her?

27:20.957 --> 27:22.790
Top row,
second from the right.

27:23.992 --> 27:25.936
No. I don't.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.022
Marcel?

27:30.665 --> 27:31.916
Marcel?

27:33.718 --> 27:35.670
Do I need to remind you
that Niklaus and Rebekah

27:35.671 --> 27:36.972
are somewhere
suffering horribly?

27:36.973 --> 27:40.424
If you know something...
Talk.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.913
The sanitorium.
That's where you'll find then.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.181
Are you sure?
How do you know?

27:47.183 --> 27:48.183
I just know.

27:48.184 --> 27:49.167
How do you know?

27:55.724 --> 27:57.826
If I'm right...

27:57.827 --> 27:59.194
You need
to know exactly

27:59.195 --> 28:01.746
what we're
walking into.

28:01.747 --> 28:03.697
We did something,
Rebekah and I.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.386
I think the witches are
trying to use it against her.

28:08.387 --> 28:14.386
It's... something
that you're not gonna like.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.947
Are you ready
to see more proof?

28:44.656 --> 28:45.641
No.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.637
What do you see?

28:58.638 --> 29:00.872
My father's blade.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.773
It went missing
when I was a boy.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.077
He beat me
half to death,

29:06.078 --> 29:08.345
so sure I had
stolen it.

29:09.297 --> 29:10.899
Rebekah was
so kind to me

29:10.900 --> 29:12.267
in the weeks
after the beating.

29:12.268 --> 29:15.237
I should have known
she was the culprit.

29:15.238 --> 29:17.105
She never could
stand weapons

29:17.106 --> 29:19.440
were things not meant
for guns.

29:19.442 --> 29:22.177
Pran ce mesaj sa a,
les cendres sur le vent.

29:39.377 --> 29:41.596
No! Klaus!

29:41.597 --> 29:43.047
My sister.

29:49.838 --> 29:55.010
Rebekah.
Rebekah!

29:55.011 --> 29:56.194
For the better part
of a century,

29:56.195 --> 29:57.696
I have wondered how
father found us,

29:57.697 --> 29:59.447
what foolish mistake
that we had made

29:59.448 --> 30:01.116
to destroy our time
in the one place

30:01.117 --> 30:02.426
that we could
finally call home.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.452
Did you know, I even
blamed myself

30:04.453 --> 30:06.236
for a time,
marcellus?

30:09.124 --> 30:10.158
Elijah.

30:10.159 --> 30:12.277
Niklaus treated you
like a son.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.104
Rebekah...
I loved her.

30:14.270 --> 30:15.830
I still love her.

30:15.831 --> 30:17.448
All we ever wanted
was to be together,

30:17.449 --> 30:18.616
but as long as
Klaus was around,

30:18.617 --> 30:19.968
that was never
gonna happen.

30:19.969 --> 30:22.053
But hey, I guess
you wouldn't know

30:22.054 --> 30:23.804
anything about
that, huh?

30:29.811 --> 30:31.229
When Klaus
learns the truth,

30:31.230 --> 30:32.647
there will be
no end to his rage.

30:32.648 --> 30:35.517
I will not
let my sister

30:35.518 --> 30:37.017
suffer that wrath.

30:40.855 --> 30:42.240
Then we need
to get to them

30:42.241 --> 30:43.967
before he learns
the truth.

30:59.140 --> 31:00.940
Just give
it up, Rebekah.

31:02.092 --> 31:03.570
It's inevitable
at this point.

31:04.812 --> 31:06.156
Sabine.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.948
I prefer
Celeste, actually.

31:10.117 --> 31:12.102
All these names I've
had over the years

31:12.103 --> 31:13.654
and I still prefer
the first.

31:13.655 --> 31:15.322
Perhaps it was
the way it sounded

31:15.323 --> 31:16.833
on Elijah's lips,

31:16.999 --> 31:18.826
like a declaration
of love.

31:18.827 --> 31:20.910
Oh, he was
a good liar.

31:22.163 --> 31:23.830
All of you are.

31:23.832 --> 31:24.965
Say what you
want about me,

31:24.966 --> 31:26.510
but Elijah is
a good man.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.018
Still defending him,

31:28.019 --> 31:29.803
even until
the bitter end.

31:31.847 --> 31:35.509
Good. I'm counting
on that familial love.

31:35.510 --> 31:37.127
It'll be the ruin
of you all.

31:37.128 --> 31:38.646
Now that Klaus knows
what you've done,

31:38.647 --> 31:40.648
he'll never stop until
he's had his revenge.

31:40.649 --> 31:43.901
He'll kill Marcel.
Do something horrible to you.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.112
Elijah will never
forgive him.

31:46.404 --> 31:47.988
Your betrayal
will ultimately

31:48.406 --> 31:50.157
pit brother
against brother.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.975
And the fabled Mikaelson
bond will crumble.

31:52.977 --> 31:54.246
I'll kill you,
you bitch.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.372
You already did.

31:57.164 --> 31:59.282
Though at the time,
I wore a different face.

32:09.827 --> 32:13.429
Genevieve, we need to talk.
Privately.

32:14.682 --> 32:16.517
I'll be fine here.
You go ahead.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.719
You should
wash up anyway.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.522
Hey.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.388
Incinerate that
as soon as you can.

32:27.027 --> 32:30.115
You were the other one.
Clara.

32:31.532 --> 32:33.033
You should have minded
your own business.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.236
I suspected my friend
was being exploited.

32:35.237 --> 32:37.353
It was my business.

32:37.355 --> 32:38.874
Call it off?
Are you mad?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.791
I was wrong.
It was stupid

32:40.792 --> 32:42.359
and... and impulsive,

32:42.360 --> 32:44.462
and it will
ruin us, Genevieve.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.297
Not just Klaus
but Elijah, too.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.216
I risked tearing
our family apart

32:49.217 --> 32:50.594
for my own
selfish happiness.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.263
I'm begging you,
please,

32:53.429 --> 32:54.921
don't bring
Mikael here.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.708
If Klaus finds out
what we have done,

32:57.709 --> 32:59.510
what you
have done...

33:02.848 --> 33:04.732
Klaus will kill me.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.109
He'll kill
my entire family.

33:06.275 --> 33:08.401
Which is exactly why
I need you to undo it.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.820
It doesn't
work that way.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.105
There is no
undoing it.

33:11.106 --> 33:13.573
Mikael is coming.
The only hope now...

33:14.742 --> 33:16.277
Is tell Klaus
the truth.

33:16.278 --> 33:17.411
Confess what
we've done.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.562
That is not an option.

33:18.563 --> 33:19.864
He will dagger me
and leave me

33:19.865 --> 33:20.865
in a box for centuries.

33:20.866 --> 33:22.248
You will not say a word.

33:26.453 --> 33:27.754
You used me.

33:29.465 --> 33:31.292
This whole time.
Our friendship.

33:31.293 --> 33:32.409
All you wanted
was a favor,

33:32.410 --> 33:34.261
and now you want
to take it back?

33:34.262 --> 33:36.680
Well, you can't.
And I will not suffer

33:36.681 --> 33:38.515
because I was foolish
enough to trust you.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.061
It was a mistake.
I know that now.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.304
But that one mistake
will destroy us.

33:44.306 --> 33:45.306
Aah!

33:45.648 --> 33:47.640
Uhh! Aah!

33:47.642 --> 33:49.693
You brought this
on yourself.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.571
I will not be destroyed
along with you.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.401
Uhh!

33:57.402 --> 33:59.319
I'm so sorry, Genevieve.

34:00.487 --> 34:02.740
But if you tell Niklaus
you summoned Mikael,

34:02.741 --> 34:04.167
you're dead either way.

34:05.659 --> 34:07.710
Genevieve,
is everything all right?

34:12.800 --> 34:15.619
So, you infected
me, too.

34:15.620 --> 34:18.505
Compelled the orderlies
to keep us in quarantine

34:18.505 --> 34:19.889
until we died.

34:46.708 --> 34:49.536
Fortunately,
I just took another body.

34:49.536 --> 34:51.536
Genevieve wasn't so lucky.

34:55.509 --> 34:57.794
Well, now that
she's back...

34:59.380 --> 35:01.180
You're the one
who's luck's run out.

35:05.386 --> 35:06.703
I'm sorry.

35:08.338 --> 35:10.924
I know how much
this hurts.

35:10.925 --> 35:12.558
To see what she did...

35:13.560 --> 35:16.029
To see who
she really is.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.899
But you needed
to know.

35:20.951 --> 35:23.329
You needed to see it.

35:24.621 --> 35:27.940
And now that you have,
you can take your revenge.

35:29.426 --> 35:31.911
Our revenge.

35:36.967 --> 35:40.096
Please. Go ahead.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.839
You'll need your strength
for what comes next.

36:48.539 --> 36:49.906
Rebekah!

36:52.543 --> 36:54.327
Rebekah!

37:09.880 --> 37:11.631
We should divide
the building.

37:11.632 --> 37:13.332
I'll start at one end,
you at the other.

37:27.264 --> 37:31.166
Nik. Nik,
it isn't true.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.602
I want to believe
you, sister.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.381
But your face tells
a different story.

37:43.730 --> 37:46.472
You cannot hide
from me, Rebekah!

37:48.585 --> 37:49.919
Nor can you run.

37:51.204 --> 37:52.671
This ends now.

38:04.083 --> 38:05.467
Uhh!

38:07.187 --> 38:08.554
Hey, there,
witch bitch.

38:09.606 --> 38:13.058
You and I are gonna
have a little chat.

38:14.477 --> 38:16.062
Rebekah!

38:43.306 --> 38:44.840
Tired of running?

38:46.393 --> 38:49.535
I know how much
you enjoy the chase.

38:49.701 --> 38:52.131
I'd sooner deny you
the pleasure.

38:52.413 --> 38:55.401
Well, then I'll take my
pleasures in other ways.

38:55.403 --> 38:58.586
No more "daggered
in a box" for you.

39:00.879 --> 39:02.609
Trust me, sister,
you'll long for what

39:02.610 --> 39:03.883
the dagger offered.

39:04.049 --> 39:07.981
This... will be
far less merciful.

39:07.982 --> 39:12.819
How to describe exactly
what this blade does?

39:12.820 --> 39:14.421
You don't have
to do this, Nik.

39:14.422 --> 39:17.207
After I plunge this
into your heart,

39:17.208 --> 39:19.342
you will be immobilized,

39:19.343 --> 39:21.511
imprispred in a state

39:21.512 --> 39:24.848
of raw,
inescapable anguish.

39:24.849 --> 39:26.906
Time loses all meaning.

39:27.072 --> 39:28.835
It's not unlike
a living hell,

39:29.199 --> 39:31.536
which I find rather fitting
given your treachery.

39:31.702 --> 39:32.701
Then do it.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.607
If that's what
you really want.

39:37.277 --> 39:39.695
Are we skipping the part
where you beg for mercy?

39:40.647 --> 39:42.031
For forgiveness?

39:43.366 --> 39:45.985
Because I was really
looking forward to that.

39:49.122 --> 39:50.489
I'll pass.

39:52.075 --> 39:53.293
I know better
than to think

39:53.294 --> 39:54.877
it would do me
any good.

39:57.797 --> 39:59.081
That's it, then?

40:00.417 --> 40:01.917
You concede?

40:03.609 --> 40:06.171
Like a lamb
to the slaughter.

40:07.757 --> 40:10.676
What would your father
think of you now?

40:31.531 --> 40:32.513
Uhh!

40:32.783 --> 40:34.583
Aah! Uhh!

40:38.204 --> 40:40.372
Uhh! Aah!

40:42.275 --> 40:43.425
Uhh!

40:45.628 --> 40:47.180
Uhh!

40:47.181 --> 40:49.515
Just the man
I wanted to see.

40:49.517 --> 40:51.184
Uhh.

40:51.185 --> 40:52.936
Rebekah's punishment
won't be complete

40:52.937 --> 40:54.786
until she watches
you die.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.538
Nik, it was my idea
to summon Mikael.

40:59.248 --> 41:01.292
If you're gonna hurt anyone,
it should be me.

41:01.458 --> 41:03.395
Such loyalty
to your beloved.

41:09.819 --> 41:13.623
You know...
If you had offered me

41:13.624 --> 41:15.542
even a fraction
of the same,

41:15.543 --> 41:17.242
I wouldn't have
to do this.

41:20.797 --> 41:22.247
Uhhaah!

41:24.147 --> 41:25.146
Ohh!

41:27.670 --> 41:28.486
Uhh!

41:35.562 --> 41:36.536
Go.

41:39.099 --> 41:42.102
Both of you.
Run as far and as fast as you can.

41:42.103 --> 41:43.268
Run!
