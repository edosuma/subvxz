WEBVTT

00:03.174 --> 00:04.435
(Meredith) MOST PEOPLE
HATE HOSPITALS.

00:04.435 --> 00:06.137
BUT NOT THE INTERNS.

00:06.137 --> 00:09.310
FOR THEM, THE HOSPITAL
IS A MAGICAL PLACE.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.011
IT'S POETIC...

00:11.011 --> 00:12.183
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

00:12.183 --> 00:13.644
THE RHYTHM
OF THE MACHINES,

00:13.644 --> 00:15.386
THE CRACKLE
OF A TRAUMA GOWN.

00:15.386 --> 00:17.618
IT'S A PLACE FULL OF PROMISE,

00:17.618 --> 00:19.450
EXCITEMENT,

00:19.450 --> 00:21.392
SURPRISES.

00:21.392 --> 00:25.156
IT'S A PLACE WHERE DREAMS
CAN COME TRUE.

00:25.156 --> 00:27.298
JUST LOOK AT THEM.
THEY'RE SO...
(indistinct conversations)

00:27.298 --> 00:29.029
FRESH AND SHINY.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.462
LAUGHING, TALKING.
IT'S PATHETIC.
(interns laugh)

00:31.462 --> 00:32.733
THEY'RE PATHETIC.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.465
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE USED TO BE THEM.

00:34.465 --> 00:36.137
WHY ARE THEY
STILL STARING AT US?

00:36.137 --> 00:38.038
JUST KEEP BUSY
AND LOOK COOL.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.039
COME HERE.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.113
SHANE'S RIGHT.
JUST GOTTA FOCUS.

00:42.113 --> 00:43.514
ON WHAT, YOUR BOOBS?
(laughs)

00:43.514 --> 00:44.815
(Jo) BREAST AWARENESS
IS THE FIRST,

00:44.815 --> 00:47.078
MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF BREAST HEALTH.

00:47.078 --> 00:49.180
(laughs)
MY COUSIN THOUGHT THAT
SHE HAD BREAST CANCER ONCE.

00:49.180 --> 00:50.721
BUT IT TURNED OUT
IT WAS JUST A BIG ZIT.

00:50.721 --> 00:52.553
HEY, IF YOU NEED
A BREAST EXAM--

00:52.553 --> 00:53.724
I DON'T.

00:53.724 --> 00:55.486
(teeth clenched)
ARE THEY STILL OUT THERE?

00:55.486 --> 00:57.428
ROUNDS ARE IN FIVE MINUTES,
FREAKS.

00:57.428 --> 01:00.231
(indistinct conversations
continue)

01:00.231 --> 01:01.392
COAST IS CLEAR.

01:01.392 --> 01:02.563
OH, THANK GOD.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.734
YOU'RE ON PEDS, RIGHT?

01:03.734 --> 01:05.096
DO YOU WANT TO SWITCH?
I'M WITH YANG.

01:05.096 --> 01:07.838
NO, I AM NOT FEEDING YOUR
CREEPY OBSESSION WITH KAREV.

01:07.838 --> 01:09.840
OOH.
WELL, GUESS YOU'LL BE STUCK

01:09.840 --> 01:11.802
WATCHING ME
OUTSHINE YOU ALL DAY, MURPHY.

01:11.802 --> 01:14.475
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
YANG LOVES ME.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.706
(Shane)
NO WAY I'M TRADING.

01:15.706 --> 01:17.278
I'VE GOT OUTPATIENT SURGERY
WITH KEPNER.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.679
SOUNDS LIKE I'LL BE
CUTTING ALL DAY.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.351
KEPNER--DUD OF ATTENDINGS.

01:20.351 --> 01:22.253
NO WAY YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING THAT COOL.

01:22.253 --> 01:24.615
I LIKE KEPNER. SHE'S THE ONLY
ONE WHO'S ACTUALLY NICE TO US.

01:24.615 --> 01:26.117
'CAUSE SHE'S THE DUD.

01:26.117 --> 01:27.318
WELL, I'M IN THE PIT
WITH MEDUSA TODAY

01:27.318 --> 01:29.190
IF ANYBODY
WANTS TO TRADE WITH ME.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.161
NOPE.
NO.

01:30.161 --> 01:31.492
NO.
UNH-UNH.

01:31.492 --> 01:34.495
(indistinct conversations)

01:38.199 --> 01:42.203
(baby fussing)

01:42.203 --> 01:44.175
YOU'RE LATE.
I HATE LATE.
NICU.

01:44.175 --> 01:46.207
WHO'S PRESENTING?

01:46.207 --> 01:48.509
I GUESS I AM.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.142
SAMANTHA MORGAN,
3 MONTHS OLD.

01:51.142 --> 01:52.843
BORN WITH IDIOPATHIC
NEONATAL CARDIOMYOPATHY.

01:52.843 --> 01:55.716
SHE'S CURRENTLY STATUS 1B
ON THE HEART TRANSPLANT LIST.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.648
WHAT DID I MISS? IS THERE
ANY UPDATE ON A HEART?

01:57.648 --> 01:59.720
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO JUST SIT HERE AND WAIT.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.522
BUT SOMETIMES
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO

02:01.522 --> 02:03.294
UNTIL A HEART
BECOMES AVAILABLE.

02:03.294 --> 02:04.795
77 DAYS.

02:04.795 --> 02:06.427
THAT'S HOW LONG SHE'S BEEN
ON THE LIST ALREADY.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.628
BUT WHO'S COUNTING,
RIGHT?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.230
SHE'LL GET A HEART.
I KNOW SHE WILL.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.701
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
YOUR DAUGHTER'S STABLE FOR NOW.

02:10.701 --> 02:11.862
OH.
OH, NO, SHE'S NOT--

02:11.862 --> 02:13.234
HE ISN'T--

02:13.234 --> 02:14.205
I'M NOT, UM...
LAURA AND I MET HERE.

02:14.205 --> 02:16.367
OUR KIDS WERE BORN
ABOUT A WEEK APART.

02:16.367 --> 02:17.638
MY SON RHYS
IS RIGHT OVER THERE.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.570
WE'RE BOTH DOING
ALL OF THIS ALONE.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.172
IT HELPS TO HAVE
A SECOND SET OF EARS

02:21.172 --> 02:23.214
TO HEAR
ALL THE MEDICAL JARGON.

02:23.214 --> 02:24.375
MY TURN NEXT?

02:24.375 --> 02:25.546
YES.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.147
(baby crying)

02:27.147 --> 02:29.480
RHYS RUTSTEIN, STATUS 2
ON THE HEART TRANSPLANT LIST,

02:29.480 --> 02:31.822
BORN WITH
A SINGLE-VENTRICLE DEFECT.

02:31.822 --> 02:33.454
POST-OP FROM RECEIVING
A CENTRAL SHUNT

02:33.454 --> 02:35.226
AND RECOVERING VERY WELL.

02:35.226 --> 02:36.827
IT'S POSSIBLE YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO TAKE RHYS HOME

02:36.827 --> 02:38.158
SOME TIME NEXT WEEK.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.291
HOME? NEXT WEEK?

02:40.291 --> 02:42.293
AH, YES. THERE'S NO REASON RHYS
HAS TO WAIT FOR A HEART HERE.

02:42.293 --> 02:44.835
OH, NOAH.
THAT'S AMAZING.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.166
OH, I'M NOT... (laughs)

02:46.166 --> 02:47.668
I-I DON'T THINK
I'M READY FOR THIS.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.200
I MEAN, I AM, BUT...

02:49.200 --> 02:50.771
HOME...

02:50.771 --> 02:53.644
WITHOUT ALL THE DOCTORS
OR NURSES OR YOU...

02:53.644 --> 02:56.407
YOU CAN DO THIS. YOU AND RHYS
ARE GONNA BE JUST FINE.

02:56.407 --> 02:57.478
WE'LL CHECK IN
WITH YOU LATER.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.949
(crying continues)

02:58.949 --> 03:00.511
DR. YANG, DID YOU READ

03:00.511 --> 03:02.913
THE RECENT "WEST COAST
SURGICAL JOURNAL" ARTICLE

03:02.913 --> 03:04.285
ON CENTRAL SHUNTS?

03:04.285 --> 03:06.257
THEY LISTED SOME
VERY COMPELLING STATISTICS.

03:06.257 --> 03:07.588
NO, I DIDN'T.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.320
I'LL GET YOU A COPY.

03:10.791 --> 03:13.824
MM.
CHECK OUT THE NEW GIRL.

03:13.824 --> 03:15.366
I WAS GONNA CALL HER DROOPY.

03:15.366 --> 03:17.228
BUT MAYBE PERKY NOW.

03:17.228 --> 03:19.330
OR DOC.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.303
(people speaking indistinctly)

03:22.303 --> 03:24.505
HEY. (sighs)

03:24.505 --> 03:27.207
(whistles) DAMN.
LOOK AT THAT THING.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.240
MM.
(chuckles)
WHAT DO THOSE RUN, 5K?

03:29.240 --> 03:30.881
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS A GIFT.
OH, FROM DADDY?

03:30.881 --> 03:32.343
NO.

03:32.343 --> 03:34.385
ALL RIGHT. DON'T GET DEFENSIVE,
PRINCESS. JUST A QUESTION.

03:34.385 --> 03:35.716
HERE.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.887
WHAT'S THIS?

03:36.887 --> 03:38.249
THAT'S YOUR JOB
THIS MORNING.

03:38.249 --> 03:39.290
I'M ON MY WAY
INTO SURGERY.

03:39.290 --> 03:41.292
BUT, UH, LITTLE CARTER KAYNIG
IN ROOM NINE,

03:41.292 --> 03:43.223
HE SWALLOWED SOME CRAYONS.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.225
CRAYONS AREN'T TOXIC. DON'T WE
JUST WAIT FOR THEM TO PASS?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.527
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HIS PARENTS HAVE BEEN DOING

03:46.527 --> 03:47.758
FOR THE PAST EIGHT DAYS.

03:47.758 --> 03:48.929
BOWEL'S IMPACTED.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.261
THE KID'S IN A LOT OF PAIN,

03:50.261 --> 03:51.932
AND HE WON'T BE PASSING IT
ON HIS OWN, SO...

03:51.932 --> 03:53.734
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO--

03:53.734 --> 03:55.306
START DIGGING, PRINCESS.

03:55.306 --> 03:56.867
OH. YOU MIGHT WANT TO
TAKE OFF YOUR WATCH FIRST.

03:56.867 --> 03:59.340
(elevator bell dings)

04:00.641 --> 04:02.813
DR. KEPNER.

04:02.813 --> 04:05.276
I'M HERE, I'M READY,
I'M EXCITED--

04:05.276 --> 04:06.447
STOP RIGHT THERE.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.948
THAT--
ALL OF THAT FAKE ENTHUSIASM--

04:07.948 --> 04:09.380
I SEE THROUGH IT,

04:09.380 --> 04:11.322
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE
INSUBORDINATION.

04:11.322 --> 04:14.385
OKAY? SO JUST ORDER THESE
BY DATE OF APPOINTMENT MADE.

04:14.385 --> 04:16.527
UH... OKAY.

04:16.527 --> 04:18.429
(sighs) PROBLEM?

04:18.429 --> 04:20.291
NO, NO, NO. IT'S JUST...
OUTPATIENT SURGERY.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.863
I WAS HOPING I'D BE DOING
SOME SURGERY ON THE OUTPATIENTS.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.895
OH, YOU'LL BE CUTTING.

04:24.895 --> 04:26.897
IT'S LUMP AND BUMP DAY.

04:26.897 --> 04:28.499
YAY?
(elevator bell dings)

04:28.499 --> 04:30.270
THIS HOSPITAL
LIKES TO SCHEDULE

04:30.270 --> 04:32.403
ALL OF ITS OUTPATIENT
MASS AND GROWTH REMOVALS

04:32.403 --> 04:33.704
ON ONE DAY.

04:33.704 --> 04:35.306
SO ONE LUCKY SURGEON
WILL FIND HERSELF

04:35.306 --> 04:38.349
CARVING OUT GLORIFIED PIMPLES
FOR 12 FREAKIN' HOURS.

04:38.349 --> 04:40.381
IT'S CALLED WHITTLING.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.384
A HILLBILLY WITH A POCKETKNIFE
COULD DO IT.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.686
COME WITH ME. (exhales)

04:45.686 --> 04:47.758
(indistinct conversations)

04:47.758 --> 04:49.320
(sighs)

04:49.320 --> 04:51.522
MR. PUBLER?

04:51.522 --> 04:54.365
PUBE-PUBLER?

04:54.365 --> 04:55.566
PU-PUBLER?

04:55.566 --> 04:57.528
(Shane) WE'RE SEEING
ALL OF THEM TODAY?

04:57.528 --> 04:59.400
OH, THIS IS
JUST THIS MORNING'S.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.532
SHARPEN YOUR POCKETKNIFE,
JETHRO.

05:01.532 --> 05:05.005
(indistinct conversations)

05:05.005 --> 05:06.737
MRS. CROSSLEY'S GETTING
A PACEMAKER TODAY

05:06.737 --> 05:08.439
FOR A COMPLETE HEART BLOCK.

05:08.439 --> 05:09.480
BARRING ANY COMPLICATIONS,

05:09.480 --> 05:11.342
SHE'LL BE GOING HOME
THIS AFTERNOON.

05:11.342 --> 05:12.483
WHAT'D THEY SAY?

05:12.483 --> 05:14.485
(raised voice) I'M GOING HOME
LATER TODAY, HONEY.

05:14.485 --> 05:16.347
OH.
(normal voice) SORRY.
HE'S DEAF IN ONE EAR.

05:16.347 --> 05:18.819
WE'LL BE PREPPING YOU
FOR SURGERY SOON.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.921
IT SHOULD BE
A FAIRLY SIMPLE PROCEDURE.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.394
WELL, I WASN'T PLANNING ON
STAYING HERE OVERNIGHT.

05:23.394 --> 05:25.325
(raised voice) NO ONE'S
ARGUING WITH YOU, HONEY.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.429
OKAY. SEE YOU SOON.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.562
I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF
RESERVING O.R. THREE FOR YOU.

05:31.562 --> 05:32.903
I KNOW YOU PREFER IT.

05:32.903 --> 05:34.435
AND I E-MAILED YOU A LIST

05:34.435 --> 05:35.566
OF MRS. CROSSLEY'S
LATEST RHYTHMS

05:35.566 --> 05:37.668
FOR REFERENCE.

05:37.668 --> 05:40.671
(people speaking indistinctly)

05:42.042 --> 05:43.343
PERKY...

05:43.343 --> 05:44.515
(elevator bell dings)
MAN THE NICU.

05:44.515 --> 05:46.877
CHECK MY POST-OPS.
GRUMPY, SCRUBBING IN.

05:46.877 --> 05:50.350
AH, LOOK AT THAT.
GUESS I'M SCRUBBING IN.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.522
(claps hands)

05:51.522 --> 05:53.123
(singsongy)
MM. MM-HMM.

05:53.123 --> 05:54.485
MM-HMM.

05:54.485 --> 05:55.456
(snaps fingers)

05:55.456 --> 05:56.627
(sighs)

05:56.627 --> 05:59.690
(indistinct conversations)

05:59.690 --> 06:03.694
♪♪♪

06:03.694 --> 06:05.736
(fabric snaps)

06:13.404 --> 06:15.476
(crashes)

06:15.476 --> 06:17.648
(heartbeat thumps)

06:17.648 --> 06:20.110
(heartbeat stops)

06:20.110 --> 06:23.684
(heartbeat thumping)

06:23.684 --> 06:26.156
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
(sound whooshes)

06:26.156 --> 06:28.589
OH. UH, I'M SORRY. I WAS...
I WAS JUST--

06:28.589 --> 06:31.091
NEVER MIND. I DON'T CARE.
GO AWAY.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.423
(indistinct conversations)

06:32.423 --> 06:33.594
(siren whoops)

06:33.594 --> 06:34.765
HELP. WE NEED A DOCTOR.
HELP.

06:34.765 --> 06:36.827
SIR, SIR. JUST CALM DOWN.

06:36.827 --> 06:38.499
PLEASE. JUST TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.431
I THINK WE KILLED BIGFOOT.
BIGFOOT?

06:40.431 --> 06:42.603
YEAH.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.934
I WAS JUST HAVING A GO
AT SOME WHITETAILS,

06:43.934 --> 06:45.476
AND I HEARD THIS SCREAM.

06:45.476 --> 06:46.437
YOU SHOT SOMEONE?

06:46.437 --> 06:47.838
I-I DIDN'T SEE HIM.
I SWEAR.

06:47.838 --> 06:49.139
IT JUST HAPPENED SO FAST,

06:49.139 --> 06:50.581
AND THEN I SAW
THIS THING COMING AT ME,

06:50.581 --> 06:51.982
LIKE--LIKE A MONSTER.

06:51.982 --> 06:54.084
DID YOU SHOOT HIM AGAIN?
I MAY HAVE FIRED
A WARNING SHOT.

06:54.084 --> 06:55.415
AND I WAS JUST
HEADED INTO TOWN

06:55.415 --> 06:56.747
AND IT JUMPED INTO THE ROAD.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.088
I TRIED TO SWERVE, BUT--

06:58.088 --> 06:59.790
WAIT. YOU SHOT BIGFOOT?

06:59.790 --> 07:01.992
AND THEN YOU RAN HIM OVER?

07:01.992 --> 07:04.054
(both) YES.

07:04.054 --> 07:05.826
WELL, WHERE'S BIGFOOT NOW
EXACTLY?

07:05.826 --> 07:06.997
OHH!

07:06.997 --> 07:08.929
(doctors scream and gasp)
AAH!

07:08.929 --> 07:10.531
AAH!

07:10.531 --> 07:11.962
(grunts)

07:11.962 --> 07:14.064
(medical staff
speaks indistinctly)
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

07:14.064 --> 07:15.566
ULTRASOUND SHOWS THE BABY
HAS C.D.H.

07:15.566 --> 07:16.567
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

07:16.567 --> 07:18.869
CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC
HERNIA.

07:18.869 --> 07:20.641
HE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
OXYGENATE WELL WHEN HE'S BORN.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.442
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU PAGE
DR. KAREV?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.874
HE'S IN SURGERY.
HE SENT YOU.

07:23.874 --> 07:25.516
OKAY. OKAY.
UM, HOW OLD IS SHE...
(woman screaming)

07:25.516 --> 07:26.577
THE MOM?
15.

07:26.577 --> 07:28.018
AAH!

07:28.018 --> 07:29.480
DON'T JUST
STAND AROUND WATCHING.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.721
DO SOMETHING.
MY BABY'S IN PAIN!

07:30.721 --> 07:32.623
COULD YOU PAGE DR. KAREV
AGAIN, PLEASE?

07:32.623 --> 07:33.884
AAH! I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

07:33.884 --> 07:35.556
I CAN'T DO THIS.
YES, YOU CAN, KIMMY.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.728
ONE LAST PUSH. HERE WE GO.
(screams and groans)

07:37.728 --> 07:38.889
(exhales)

07:38.889 --> 07:40.491
(Kimmy exhales)

07:40.491 --> 07:42.563
(medical staff
speaking indistinctly)

07:42.563 --> 07:43.964
OKAY.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.567
(woman) WATCH THE MONITOR.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.898
HE'S SO SMALL.
HE'S JUST--

07:47.898 --> 07:49.970
WHAT DO WE DO?
WHAT DO WE DO?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.802
YOU'RE THE SURGEON, HON.
YOU TELL US.

07:51.802 --> 07:54.104
(exhales)

07:54.104 --> 08:02.212
(breathes unsteadily)

08:02.212 --> 08:03.483
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

08:08.859 --> 08:11.862
(distorted sound of monitor
beeping rapidly)

08:11.862 --> 08:14.865
♪♪♪

08:17.798 --> 08:20.030
(rustles)

08:20.030 --> 08:23.173
(distorted beeping continues)

08:25.906 --> 08:27.277
(sound whooshes)

08:27.277 --> 08:28.779
DR. WILSON,
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?

08:28.779 --> 08:29.940
OKAY, OKAY.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.081
HIS SATs ARE LOW.
WE NEED TO INTUBATE.

08:31.081 --> 08:33.283
GET ME A LARYNGOSCOPE
AND INTUBATION TRAY.

08:33.283 --> 08:34.715
IT HURTS.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.186
IT'S OKAY, SUGAR.
IT'S OKAY. RIGHT?

08:36.186 --> 08:37.588
EVERYTHING IS OKAY?

08:37.588 --> 08:40.050
OKAY, HAND ME
A SIZE 4 E.T. TUBE.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.291
NO, NO, NO. A SMALLER ONE.

08:41.291 --> 08:42.923
SATs ARE DROPPING.
THERE YOU GO.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.755
OKAY, HANG ON.
HIS EPIGLOTTIS IS FLOPPY.

08:44.755 --> 08:46.056
THERE NO TIME TO HANG ON.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

08:46.056 --> 08:47.558
SOMEBODY WANT TO TELL
MY BABY WHAT'S HAPPENING?

08:47.558 --> 08:49.059
IF I COULD JUST GET
THIS TUBE TO PASS.

08:49.059 --> 08:50.260
(woman) DR. WILSON--

08:50.260 --> 08:52.663
GOT IT. GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

08:52.663 --> 08:54.765
YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE.
OKAY.

08:54.765 --> 08:55.936
NOW WHAT'S NEXT?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.808
UM, I THINK THAT, UM...

08:57.808 --> 08:59.539
HOW ABOUT SUCTION?

08:59.539 --> 09:02.042
AND MAYBE YOU WANT TO PUT IN
AN UMBILICAL CATHETER.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.744
YES. RIGHT. YES.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.576
AND PLEASE
PAGE DR. KAREV AGAIN.

09:05.576 --> 09:07.217
(woman) I'LL PAGE HIM.

09:07.217 --> 09:09.049
(man) GUY'S CRAZY,
WEARING THIS THING.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.550
I-IT'S LIKE
HE WANTED TO GET SHOT.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.122
BROOKS, GET OVER HERE
AND HELP WITH THE CUTTING.

09:12.122 --> 09:13.984
(monitor beeping erratically)

09:13.984 --> 09:15.325
(groans)
OH!

09:15.325 --> 09:16.927
DID YOU CUT HIM?

09:16.927 --> 09:17.988
DON'T CUT MY GHILLIE SUIT.

09:17.988 --> 09:19.329
HIS WHAT?

09:19.329 --> 09:21.692
IT'S ARMY ISSUE.
BEST DAMN CAMOUFLAGE THERE IS.

09:21.692 --> 09:23.193
YEAH, FOR WAR.
NOT HUNTING DEER.

09:23.193 --> 09:24.935
WE WEAR ORANGE COATS
FOR A REASON.

09:24.935 --> 09:26.697
OH, I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
(fabric rips)

09:26.697 --> 09:28.939
YOU KNOW, I MYSELF
PREFER HOBBIES LIKE

09:28.939 --> 09:31.301
STAMP COLLECTING
OR CROCHET--

09:31.301 --> 09:34.074
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE
GUNS AND...

09:34.074 --> 09:35.746
(grunts)
HELPLESS LITTLE CREATURES.

09:35.746 --> 09:37.007
(beeping continues)

09:37.007 --> 09:39.179
UM, BROOKS, ESCORT
THE GENTLEMEN OUTSIDE.
(Brooks) OKAY.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.351
THIS WAY.
HI, DR. TORRES, WE JUST HEARD
BACK ABOUT THE CADAVER NERVES,

09:41.351 --> 09:44.084
BUT THE LONGEST THEY HAVE
IS 7 CENTIMETERS.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.255
OH, DAMN IT.
WE NEED MORE THAN THAT.

09:45.255 --> 09:46.617
OKAY.

09:46.617 --> 09:47.958
(Miranda) NO BLOOD
IN THE PERICARDIUM.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.119
(Richard) THERE'S DEFINITE
ABDOMINAL GUARDING.

09:49.119 --> 09:51.361
BROOKS, REACH IN MY LEFT POCKET.
GET MY PHONE.

09:51.361 --> 09:52.893
GO INTO MY PHONE BOOK.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.995
GO TO "SHEPHERD--
NANCY, AMY, LIZ, AND KATE."

09:54.995 --> 09:56.166
CALL ALL OF HIS SISTERS.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.768
SEE WHICH ONE'S WILLING
TO DONATE A NERVE.

09:57.768 --> 09:58.929
FIRST ONE THAT BITES,
GRAB ME.

09:58.929 --> 10:00.100
OKAY, DEREK WAS VERY CLEAR.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.972
HE WANTS TO USE A CADAVER NERVE
FOR HIS HAND SURGERY.

10:01.972 --> 10:03.373
YOU'RE ON SISTER DUTY. GO.

10:03.373 --> 10:05.035
YOU'RE SURE YOU DON'T
NEED MORE HANDS,

10:05.035 --> 10:06.006
YOU KNOW, IN HERE?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.177
WE GOT THIS.
NOPE.

10:07.177 --> 10:08.979
WE GOT IT.
WE SHOULD TURN HIM OVER.

10:08.979 --> 10:10.110
(Richard) YES. SEE IF
THERE'S AN EXIT WOUND.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.642
(Miranda) YEAH? OKAY.

10:11.642 --> 10:13.714
(indistinct conversations)

10:13.714 --> 10:16.046
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

10:16.046 --> 10:17.648
(sighs)

10:17.648 --> 10:18.819
FILL ME IN.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.990
BABY BORN WITH A C.D.H.
I INTUBATED HIM.

10:19.990 --> 10:21.151
BUT THE SATs ARE STILL LOW.

10:21.151 --> 10:22.122
AH, IT COULD BE
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.824
YOU EVER HOOKED A BABY UP
TO ECMO BEFORE?

10:23.824 --> 10:25.225
I NEVER INTUBATED A BABY
BEFORE FIVE MINUTES AGO.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.397
OKAY, WE HOOK UP CATHETERS
INTO HIS NECK,

10:27.397 --> 10:28.929
PUMP HIS BLOOD
INTO THE ECMO MACHINE,

10:28.929 --> 10:31.101
WHICH PUTS IN OXYGEN, AND TAKES
OUT THE CARBON DIOXIDE.

10:31.101 --> 10:32.402
THEN IT CYCLES IT
ALL BACK IN.

10:32.402 --> 10:33.834
OKAY.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.305
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU GET GOOD BORDERS

10:35.305 --> 10:37.107
SO WE CAN SEND THIS TO PATH.

10:37.107 --> 10:40.170
WHOA. THAT'S...
(inhales sharply)

10:40.170 --> 10:41.641
WHOA.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.143
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT'S "WHOA"?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.815
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST KEEPS COMING.

10:44.815 --> 10:46.216
YOU DON'T KNOW?

10:46.216 --> 10:48.178
(clears throat)

10:49.980 --> 10:52.182
HI.

10:52.182 --> 10:54.855
I KNOW HOW SCARY
THIS MUST BE FOR YOU.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.987
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT WE ARE TAKING

10:56.987 --> 11:00.190
REALLY GOOD CARE OF YOU,
OKAY?

11:00.190 --> 11:01.331
DR. ROSS...
(clatters)

11:01.331 --> 11:02.963
A WORD.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.194
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

11:04.194 --> 11:08.338
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:08.338 --> 11:10.040
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:10.040 --> 11:11.842
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S DISGUSTING.

11:11.842 --> 11:15.045
YOU WERE, LIKE, A MAGICIAN
WITH A HANDKERCHIEF.

11:15.045 --> 11:18.308
ROSS, THESE LUMPS
ARE ATTACHED TO PEOPLE.

11:18.308 --> 11:20.711
SCARED PEOPLE.

11:20.711 --> 11:23.914
YOU NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT FEAR AND EASE IT.

11:23.914 --> 11:27.387
YOU LOOK THEM IN THE EYE,
YOU TALK TO THEM LIKE YOU CARE.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.289
I-IMAGINE IF IT WERE YOU
AND I WAS PULLING

11:29.289 --> 11:31.121
A WORMY HANDKERCHIEF
OUT OF YOUR FLESH.

11:31.121 --> 11:32.692
(exhales)

11:32.692 --> 11:35.766
I... I'M SURE YOU THINK
THIS IS BENEATH YOU.

11:35.766 --> 11:37.097
OKAY? I GET IT.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.899
I KNOW YOU GUYS
CALL ME "THE DUD."

11:38.899 --> 11:40.200
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THESE PATIENTS

11:40.200 --> 11:42.172
DON'T DESERVE YOUR RESPECT
AND CARE,

11:42.172 --> 11:44.034
NOW MATTER HOW CRAPPY
YOU FEEL.

11:45.335 --> 11:47.177
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

11:47.177 --> 11:48.909
I...

11:48.909 --> 11:50.440
I THINK SO.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.912
ENOUGH WITH THE ATTITUDE.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.844
(man) HELLO?

11:59.449 --> 12:02.953
AND HERE YOU GO.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

12:02.953 --> 12:04.124
(exhales)

12:04.124 --> 12:05.796
(clears throat)

12:05.796 --> 12:07.127
DUDE, I AM A ROCK STAR.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.130
I JUST ROCKED PACEMAKER
POST-OP DICTATION ON MY OWN.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.462
THAT IS HOW MUCH
YANG TRUSTS ME.

12:12.462 --> 12:13.834
THAT'S COOL.
MM-HMM.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.035
NOT AS COOL
AS THIS MAYBE.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.366
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

12:16.366 --> 12:18.268
YEAH.
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN LEAH?

12:18.268 --> 12:19.870
'CAUSE I HAVE
SOME MORE GLOATING TO DO.

12:19.870 --> 12:22.012
OH, YEAH. I JUST PASSED HER.
9-1-1 IN THE NICU, I THINK.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.846
(Cristina) WHAT DO YOU SEE?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.017
(monitor beeping erratically)

12:27.017 --> 12:28.318
(Leah) IS THAT AN EFFUSION
AROUND HIS HEART?

12:28.318 --> 12:31.121
HOW COULD HE HAVE C.H.F.?
HE HAS A SHUNT.

12:31.121 --> 12:33.023
HIS SHUNT MIGHT BE LEAKING.

12:33.023 --> 12:34.284
HE'S TAMPONADING.
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:34.284 --> 12:35.385
HE WAS FINE, AND THEN
HE JUST--HE WASN'T.

12:35.385 --> 12:36.756
IT'S OKAY.
IT'LL BE OKAY.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.088
LET'S PREP HIM
FOR TRANSPORT.

12:38.088 --> 12:39.389
WHAT CAN I DO? DO YOU NEED
ANOTHER SET OF HANDS IN THERE?

12:39.389 --> 12:40.390
I NEED YOU TO KEEP AN EYE
ON MY PATIENTS

12:40.390 --> 12:41.832
AND CALL THE O.R.

12:41.832 --> 12:43.233
TELL THEM WE'RE COMING UP.

12:43.233 --> 12:44.364
HUH. LOOK AT THAT.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.096
GUESS I'M SCRUBBING IN
THIS TIME.

12:46.096 --> 12:49.269
(beeping continues)

12:49.269 --> 12:51.872
(suction gurgling,
monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:51.872 --> 12:53.904
UH, THE BULLET'S TORN
THROUGH THE COLON.

12:53.904 --> 12:56.907
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO RESECT THIS.

12:56.907 --> 12:59.309
(gurgling continues)

12:59.309 --> 13:03.383
UM... SHE BELONG
TO ANY OF YOU?

13:03.383 --> 13:04.955
(beeping continues)

13:04.955 --> 13:06.817
(Meredith) BROOKS, DO I LOOK
LIKE I ENJOY MULTITASKING?

13:06.817 --> 13:08.158
WHAT'S THE REPORT?

13:08.158 --> 13:10.220
I-I LEFT MESSAGES
FOR KATHLEEN AND AMY.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.092
NANCY HUNG UP ON ME.
I CALLED HER BACK.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.094
SHE HUNG UP ON ME AGAIN SO I'M
GUESSING THAT SHE'S A "NO."

13:14.094 --> 13:15.795
BUT I DID TALK TO LIZZIE,
AND SHE MIGHT BE IN.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.398
ALSO, SHE WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT SIZE ZOLA WEARS NOW.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.201
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE A 2-T,
BUT THAT'S JUST A GUESS.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.302
ANYWAY, CAN I SCRUB IN?
(door opens)

13:22.302 --> 13:23.503
(Derek) MEREDITH.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.275
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM LIZZIE.

13:25.275 --> 13:27.407
SHE'S UNDER THE IMPRESSION
SHE'S GONNA DONATE A NERVE

13:27.407 --> 13:28.578
TO ME.

13:28.578 --> 13:30.941
YAY!

13:30.941 --> 13:32.242
NOT YAY.

13:32.242 --> 13:34.414
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR, I
DIDN'T WANT MY FAMILY INVOLVED.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.286
WELL, A LIVE DONOR NERVE
IS PREFERABLE,

13:36.286 --> 13:38.118
AND IT'S DEFINITELY
EASIER TO FIND.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.420
MY HAND, MY SISTERS,
MY DECISION.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.992
THE LONGER WE WAIT,
THE LESS CHANCE WE HAVE

13:41.992 --> 13:43.223
THAT IT WILL WORK.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.324
AND WE NEED THIS TO WORK,

13:44.324 --> 13:46.026
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.327
SOUNDS LIKE
A NO-BRAINER TO ME.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.599
BUT WHAT DO I KNOW?
I DON'T HAVE SISTERS.

13:49.599 --> 13:51.361
WHO'D YOU GET
TO MAKE THE CALLS?

13:51.361 --> 13:53.463
(suction gurgling)

13:53.463 --> 13:57.007
CALL THEM ALL BACK
AND UNDO WHAT YOU DID.

13:57.007 --> 13:58.538
NOW.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.371
(door opens)

14:01.371 --> 14:03.313
DON'T UNDO A THING.

14:03.313 --> 14:04.915
(door closes)

14:04.915 --> 14:06.246
(Alex) YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.248
YOU'VE ISOLATED THE JUGULAR
AND THE CAROTID,

14:08.248 --> 14:09.579
AVOIDED THE VAGUS NERVE.

14:09.579 --> 14:11.521
NOW YOU NEED TO PUT IN
A VENOUS DRAINAGE CANNULA.

14:11.521 --> 14:13.083
(monitor beeping erratically)
I HADN'T EVEN--

14:13.083 --> 14:15.155
HE'S CODING. SWITCH WITH ME.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.626
YOU NEED TO DO C.P.R. WHILE I
HOOK THE KID UP TO ECMO.

14:16.626 --> 14:18.328
AT THE SAME TIME?
HOW WILL THAT WORK?

14:18.328 --> 14:21.091
START THE COMPRESSIONS NOW.

14:21.091 --> 14:22.292
(beeping continues)

14:22.292 --> 14:23.994
STOP.

14:23.994 --> 14:26.566
(beeping continues)

14:26.566 --> 14:27.938
GO.

14:27.938 --> 14:29.269
KEEP GOING.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.441
STOP.

14:31.441 --> 14:32.903
(gurgling)

14:32.903 --> 14:35.405
OKAY. KEEP GOING.

14:35.405 --> 14:36.947
(beeping continues)

14:36.947 --> 14:38.408
STOP.

14:38.408 --> 14:40.480
(beeping continues)

14:40.480 --> 14:42.012
(clamp clicks)

14:42.012 --> 14:44.254
GO.

14:49.419 --> 14:50.590
(monitor beeping erratically)

14:50.590 --> 14:52.092
HOW LONG
HAVE WE BEEN GOING?

14:52.092 --> 14:53.193
20 MINUTES.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.494
STOP.
