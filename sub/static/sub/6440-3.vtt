00:21.662 --> 00:23.857
Hut! Hut!

00:45.253 --> 00:46.948
Whitney, get over here!

00:47.288 --> 00:50.018
Refresh my memory.
Didn't I just send a pass play in there?

00:50.191 --> 00:53.160
The rain's coming down so hard
I couldn't see if Donner was open-

00:53.327 --> 00:55.261
Hey! What does it say on my jacket?

00:55.563 --> 00:56.825
- "Coach."
- That's right.

00:56.998 --> 00:58.761
Football is not a democracy...

00:58.933 --> 01:02.630
...and you will do as I say
because I know what's best for you.

01:02.803 --> 01:06.295
Now, look, son, we have run this play
a hundred times in practice.

01:06.474 --> 01:09.966
You don't have to see Donner
to know where he is, just throw it.

01:10.144 --> 01:13.136
Now, I want you to go out there
and run the same play.

01:13.314 --> 01:16.249
And I want you
to win this game for us, okay?

01:16.417 --> 01:17.714
Go ahead.

02:16.143 --> 02:20.273
All right, listen up! There is another team
eating Crow tonight, gentlemen!

02:22.283 --> 02:25.844
I don't have to tell you how important
next Friday night's game is.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.784
Not only is it gonna put us
in the state championship...

02:28.956 --> 02:31.015
...but it'll be Coach Walt's 200th win!

02:31.192 --> 02:35.288
Coach Walt! Coach Walt! Coach Walt!

03:25.046 --> 03:26.946
Come on in.

03:27.615 --> 03:31.346
Principal Kwan,
what brings you to the sweat box?

03:31.519 --> 03:33.487
We've got a problem, coach.

03:35.256 --> 03:41.161
- Cheating, huh? My boys?
- Seven of them, on their math midterm.

03:41.329 --> 03:44.560
Which means they're ineligible
for next Friday's game.

03:44.732 --> 03:47.428
Well, just keep it quiet
for a couple of weeks...

03:47.601 --> 03:51.093
...and we'll deal with it in the off-season.

03:51.272 --> 03:55.606
I'm not sweeping a major academic breach
under the carpet so you can win a game.

03:58.779 --> 04:02.374
You've been here, what, six months?
I've been here 25 years.

04:02.550 --> 04:05.986
We're not talking about just a game.
We're talking about my legacy.

04:06.153 --> 04:09.680
I don't care about your legacy.
I'm here to educate young people.

04:09.857 --> 04:11.984
I've been educating young people
all my life.

04:12.159 --> 04:14.889
You know how many boys have gone
on to college because of me?

04:15.062 --> 04:17.223
Have gotten good jobs
on my recommendations?

04:18.632 --> 04:21.624
I know most people think
you walk on water, coach.

04:21.802 --> 04:23.292
I think you're dangerous.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.996
I've seen your temper.
I've seen your methods.

04:26.173 --> 04:28.198
Just because you win
doesn't make you right.

04:30.411 --> 04:34.313
On Monday, I'm suspending the players.
End of story.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.414
No!

05:45.119 --> 05:48.520
- "Football: Sport or Abuse?"
- So, what do you think?

05:48.689 --> 05:51.715
I think you need to seriously decrease
your cappuccino dependency.

05:51.892 --> 05:54.019
Pete thinks I'm being too hard
on Coach Walt.

05:54.195 --> 05:57.722
I mean, the man coached my dad,
all my brothers.

05:57.898 --> 06:00.025
He used to come over
and watch the Super Bowl.

06:00.201 --> 06:02.169
While I'm touched
by that Hallmark moment...

06:02.336 --> 06:04.566
...you don't get points for
subtlety in journalism.

06:04.738 --> 06:08.003
- I've started getting hate mail.
- You seem very happy about that. Why?

06:08.175 --> 06:09.836
Because it means I'm hitting a nerve.

06:10.010 --> 06:14.106
Besides, between the abysmal sentence
structure and generous use of obscenities...

06:14.281 --> 06:17.216
...I've got a pretty good idea
of who's been sending it.

06:17.384 --> 06:21.445
<i>If you think my teammates read the Torch,
you're giving them way too much credit.</i>

06:22.723 --> 06:26.159
- Don't you even care about this?
- I don't see what the big deal is.

06:26.327 --> 06:30.423
You don't think it's a big deal?
I think it's a big deal.

06:33.167 --> 06:37.263
There's something you don't see every day.
A pom-pom meltdown.

06:38.138 --> 06:41.005
Here they come.
I need a picture of the cheating jockstraps.

06:41.175 --> 06:44.144
I don't want to hear any rumors going around,
any false accusations.

06:44.512 --> 06:46.343
Any idea how they got that midterm?

06:46.881 --> 06:48.781
Still a mystery, but I'm working on it.

06:48.949 --> 06:50.644
- We got a problem-
- What's she doing?

06:53.787 --> 06:55.755
Nice catch.

06:55.923 --> 06:57.788
Your teammate attempts
to assassinate me...

06:57.958 --> 07:01.621
- ... and all you can say is "nice catch"?
- I thought you wanted to hit a nerve.

07:19.980 --> 07:23.507
Hey, Kent.
I saw your arm out there.

07:23.684 --> 07:25.652
Technique was lousy,
but you've got power.

07:25.819 --> 07:28.617
- Thanks.
- So why aren't you on our team?

07:28.789 --> 07:31.553
- My dad needs me on the farm.
- Your school needs you on the field.

07:31.725 --> 07:34.250
We've got a big game Friday night.
We're short players.

07:34.428 --> 07:37.192
Look, look.
I know your dad would understand.

07:37.364 --> 07:39.594
- He's kind of stubborn.
- Yeah, I remember.

07:39.767 --> 07:44.204
Jonathan Kent was one of the best athletes
I ever coached. A lot of God-given talent.

07:44.371 --> 07:46.362
It's in your genes, Kent.

07:47.308 --> 07:48.570
Actually, I'm adopted.

07:52.513 --> 07:56.973
Look, I'm giving you a chance to be a part
of something special. A part of history.

07:57.151 --> 08:00.245
I've seen you stare at your father's
picture in that trophy case.

08:00.421 --> 08:03.151
Don't tell me you don't want to be
a part of this.

08:03.857 --> 08:06.018
Now, why don't you suit up?

08:06.327 --> 08:08.522
Look at Ross.
He doesn't have natural talent...

08:08.696 --> 08:12.928
- ... but he's got a truckload of heart.
- Thanks, I guess.

08:15.002 --> 08:16.196
Let me think about it.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.099
Fordman, get over here.

08:19.807 --> 08:22.708
- Hey, Clark.
- Fordman, you're the team captain.

08:22.876 --> 08:25.003
How do you think Kent
would do on the field?

08:25.179 --> 08:27.147
I mean, considering our current predicament?

08:27.314 --> 08:29.305
He might do all right.

08:29.717 --> 08:33.118
- He seems afraid, though.
- That's not the reason, is it, Clark?

08:33.821 --> 08:35.413
- It's my dad-
- Kent.

08:36.857 --> 08:40.155
There comes a time when you've got
to step out of your father's shadow...

08:40.327 --> 08:42.659
...and be your own man.
Now, what do you say?

08:42.996 --> 08:44.760
Are you ready to be your own man?

08:49.837 --> 08:52.135
- Count me in.
- Good.

08:52.306 --> 08:55.605
I will see you at practice today, 3:00.
Don't be late.

08:56.477 --> 08:58.809
Hey, Clark. Hey.

08:58.979 --> 09:02.642
Remind me what your dad said
last time you asked him to play.

09:02.816 --> 09:06.445
- He said no.
- He said no. That's what I thought.

09:06.620 --> 09:09.851
Call me when the hurting's done, okay?

09:13.327 --> 09:15.318
- So are we okay?
- This isn't about us.

09:15.496 --> 09:17.794
The guys made a mistake.
I don't see the big deal.

09:17.965 --> 09:20.331
They cheated.
I don't know how you can support them.

09:20.501 --> 09:23.766
Because they're my friends,
and they used to be yours.

09:24.104 --> 09:26.504
Do you want to tell me
what's really going on here?

09:26.674 --> 09:28.733
The things that I thought I knew for sure...

09:28.909 --> 09:32.504
- ... don't seem so certain anymore.
- I don't understand.

09:34.348 --> 09:37.283
I know how much you love football,
and you're great at it...

09:37.451 --> 09:38.975
...and I support you.

09:41.288 --> 09:44.451
I want to find something that I'm great at.

09:55.436 --> 09:57.836
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, you had to say yes?

09:58.005 --> 09:59.802
Coach Walt didn't give me a choice.

09:59.973 --> 10:03.136
Let me guess. Did he give you
the "be your own man" speech?

10:04.912 --> 10:07.005
Walt's been giving that speech
for 25 years.

10:07.181 --> 10:09.206
Same one. Believe me, I know.

10:09.383 --> 10:12.147
You've gotta go there tomorrow
and tell him you can't play.

10:12.319 --> 10:14.412
Dad, please don't make me do that.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.983
I'm sorry,
we've already had this conversation.

10:17.157 --> 10:21.719
It's never been a conversation.
I can be careful, and you don't trust me.

10:22.496 --> 10:26.398
- Of course I trust you, Clark, but-
- But what?

10:26.567 --> 10:28.626
- I'm old enough to make decisions.
- On the field...

10:28.802 --> 10:30.793
...a million things can affect your judgment.

10:30.971 --> 10:32.700
If you get angry for just a second...

10:32.873 --> 10:36.536
...or you try to impress some girl
with a fancy move...

10:36.710 --> 10:38.439
...somebody could get seriously hurt.

10:38.679 --> 10:42.911
You were meant for much more important
things than winning football games.

10:43.784 --> 10:46.514
I'm sick of being punished
because I have these gifts.

10:46.687 --> 10:50.054
Most parents would be happy if their son
could be the star of the football team.

10:50.424 --> 10:54.520
Son, I am happy
when you wake up in the morning.

10:55.763 --> 10:59.927
Now, I don't need to live vicariously
through your achievements.

11:01.301 --> 11:04.031
Why would you? You got to play.

11:07.307 --> 11:10.765
- I'm not signing the permission slip, Clark.
- You don't have to.

11:11.345 --> 11:14.371
I'm playing football,
and you can't stop me.

11:24.792 --> 11:29.092
Well, if it isn't the three wise men.
Hello, Dominic.

11:29.263 --> 11:32.755
I assume you're late
because you've been in a fencing lesson...

11:32.933 --> 11:35.128
...or have you taken up polo again?

11:35.702 --> 11:38.933
I'm not running late.
I canceled this meeting, if you recall.

11:39.106 --> 11:42.075
Your father insisted
that we drive down here and keep it.

11:42.242 --> 11:45.109
And when he barks, you jump.

11:46.513 --> 11:49.778
- Have you seen the quarterly numbers?
- Yes, I have.

11:49.950 --> 11:51.611
We're 20 percent below projections.

11:51.785 --> 11:54.652
And your father wants you
to take drastic action.

11:54.822 --> 11:56.687
I plan to.

11:56.857 --> 12:01.521
Good, then I can inform him
that you'll be cutting your work force.

12:01.695 --> 12:06.826
On the contrary. You can inform him
I plan on increasing my work force.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.298
- By how much?
- Twenty percent.

12:10.704 --> 12:13.798
Lex, I've always enjoyed
your unique sense of humor...

12:14.041 --> 12:16.009
...but you can't be serious.

12:16.176 --> 12:18.508
You've got to spend money
to make money.

12:18.679 --> 12:22.615
If we increase productivity and marketing
while our competitors retreat...

12:23.150 --> 12:27.883
...when the sector bounces back,
we'll corner the market.

12:28.055 --> 12:30.888
Your father sent you to Smallville
to turn the plant around.

12:31.058 --> 12:34.892
He sent me to Smallville because
he'd rather surround himself with drones...

12:35.095 --> 12:38.394
...than people who challenge
his archaic business practices.

12:38.565 --> 12:41.033
- I'll be certain to tell him that.
- Please do.

12:41.235 --> 12:44.830
Now, this meeting is adjourned.

12:47.841 --> 12:50.173
By the way, Dominic...

12:50.978 --> 12:53.572
...tell your sister I said hi.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.921
Lana, you're home early.
Did they cancel cheerleading practice?

13:10.097 --> 13:12.588
Sort of. I quit.

13:12.966 --> 13:17.835
You loved being on the squad.
What happened?

13:18.005 --> 13:22.669
I just think there's more to life than
memorizing cheers and shaking pom-poms.

13:22.876 --> 13:25.743
You just decided this out of the blue?

13:27.114 --> 13:29.412
Some of the football players
were caught cheating.

13:29.583 --> 13:32.347
Guys I know.
I told Whitney how upset it made me...

13:32.519 --> 13:36.580
...he said it was no big deal,
that people aren't perfect.

13:37.357 --> 13:41.657
I thought, "Why am I doing this,
wearing a fake smile and stupid outfit...

13:41.828 --> 13:44.456
...for people who will do anything
to win a game?"

13:44.631 --> 13:48.089
Well, you can't let a couple of bad apples
spoil the experience.

13:48.268 --> 13:50.736
You're part of a team,
you're making friends.

13:52.105 --> 13:53.902
Aunt Nell, I don't want to go back.

13:54.074 --> 13:56.440
I want to try different things.
What's wrong with that?

13:56.610 --> 13:59.443
Nothing.
It's just that you're on a good track.

13:59.613 --> 14:01.706
I want you to be happy.

14:02.082 --> 14:05.074
What are you gonna do
with this newfound freedom?

14:05.252 --> 14:07.846
I thought I'd get a job,
something part-time.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.888
Earn some extra money
so I can go travel in the summer.

14:12.326 --> 14:15.921
Well, I suppose I could always use
some help around the shop.

14:16.229 --> 14:21.166
Thanks, but I'm not looking for help.
I want to do this on my own.

14:37.584 --> 14:41.918
- Have you seen Lana?
- No, but there's your dad.

14:43.590 --> 14:47.583
Dad, I'm glad you're here.
It means a lot to me.

14:48.161 --> 14:52.359
I still don't support your decision, Clark.
I'm here to see that no one gets hurt.

14:54.735 --> 14:57.067
Hustle it up, guys, come on.

14:58.305 --> 15:02.105
- Come on, line it up.
- Kent, get in there at tailback.

15:02.275 --> 15:05.767
Blue, 32!
Hut, hut, hut!

15:06.346 --> 15:08.314
Kent, it's yours.

15:10.150 --> 15:12.550
Yeah, Kent, it's yours.

15:13.153 --> 15:18.318
Kent! Quit looking in the stands!
Your dad's not coaching this team, I am!

15:18.492 --> 15:20.824
I didn't bring you out here
to be a tackling dummy.

15:20.994 --> 15:23.189
Get angry, kick some butt!

15:30.203 --> 15:31.966
All right, guys, same play.

15:32.205 --> 15:33.968
Yeah, we got him.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.474
Blue, 32! Blue, 32!

15:37.644 --> 15:39.805
Hut, hut!

15:56.329 --> 16:00.766
All right, way to go, Kent!
That's what I'm talking about.

16:00.934 --> 16:04.199
- I don't know what that was.
- Yeah, Clark! Way to go, Clark!

16:16.950 --> 16:19.510
How's my favorite football fan?

16:19.686 --> 16:22.280
One of the players accused of cheating
came forward...

16:22.456 --> 16:24.583
...and said you
supplied them with the tests.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.722
And what boy told you
that little piece of fiction?

16:30.197 --> 16:31.721
I'm not at liberty to say.

16:31.898 --> 16:34.298
I'm guessing you already went
to the school board...

16:34.468 --> 16:38.370
- ... and asked them to suspend me.
- You have a lot of friends in high places.

16:38.538 --> 16:41.132
I should have. I coached most of them.

16:41.508 --> 16:45.410
You don't understand.
I'm an institution.

16:45.579 --> 16:47.809
Who'd you think the school board
was gonna believe...

16:47.981 --> 16:51.178
...some cheating little brat
who's just trying to cover his own ass...

16:51.351 --> 16:55.344
...or the man who's been leading
this school to victory for 25 years?

16:55.555 --> 17:00.151
They may not believe one, but
if I can get all of them to step forward...

17:00.360 --> 17:01.793
...the board will have no choice.

17:01.962 --> 17:04.396
They'll suspend you from coaching
for the rest of your life.

17:04.731 --> 17:07.962
You will not bring me down!

17:15.208 --> 17:17.300
What the hell's going on here, coach?

17:34.027 --> 17:37.360
Who the hell does he think he is?

18:01.688 --> 18:06.955
- Where'd your dad go?
- He kind of had to get back to the farm.

18:09.062 --> 18:10.825
Go get help!

18:40.827 --> 18:43.261
Okay, thanks, bye-bye.

18:43.430 --> 18:46.365
Principal Kwan's gonna be in the hospital
till over the weekend.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.626
- Is he gonna be all right?
- He's got burns...

18:48.802 --> 18:52.533
...and suffered smoke inhalation,
but he's gonna be okay.

18:53.306 --> 18:54.568
Anybody see you, son?

18:57.043 --> 18:58.510
Nobody saw me, Dad.

18:59.379 --> 19:01.677
I told the paramedics I wrapped
my hands in my jacket...

19:01.848 --> 19:04.180
- ... when I pulled him out.
- Lucky you were there.

19:05.085 --> 19:07.417
Well, I kind of missed my ride.

19:09.155 --> 19:13.683
Look, I saw you play, all right?

19:14.527 --> 19:16.927
You could have easily hurt
any one of those boys.

19:17.097 --> 19:19.793
But the point is, I didn't.

19:21.701 --> 19:25.467
Why are we having this conversation?
He's never gonna believe me.

19:27.073 --> 19:29.371
By the way,
coach gave me your old position.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.673
You're looking at the starting tailback
for this Friday's game.

19:40.453 --> 19:43.115
Don't everyone congratulate me at once.

19:46.660 --> 19:50.152
- How did he get to be so stubborn?
- Gee, I don't know.

19:50.330 --> 19:52.855
Wait a minute. I was not like that
when I was his age.

19:53.033 --> 19:56.059
No, you were the obedient son
who always obeyed his father...

19:56.236 --> 20:00.138
...and didn't run away one summer
and try out for the Metropolis Sharks.

20:00.607 --> 20:02.541
When did you go and join the other side?

20:02.709 --> 20:07.112
Jonathan, Clark hasn't been able
to do anything normal his whole life.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.872
No play groups, no Little League...

20:09.149 --> 20:11.549
...all because we were afraid
he might hurt somebody.

20:11.718 --> 20:14.050
He's a teenager now.
Let's give him a shot.

20:14.220 --> 20:16.484
His gifts come with responsibilities.

20:16.656 --> 20:19.250
This isn't about his gifts,
it's about his judgment.

20:19.426 --> 20:22.452
You're telling Clark
that you don't believe in him.

20:22.629 --> 20:24.062
Of course I believe in him.

20:25.098 --> 20:30.297
What if he makes a mistake
and somebody suspects the truth?

20:30.470 --> 20:33.030
I mean, I do not want
anyone coming on this farm...

20:33.206 --> 20:35.071
...and taking our son away from us.

20:36.176 --> 20:39.407
If we don't start trusting him,
nobody will have to take him away...

20:39.579 --> 20:41.342
...he's gonna leave all by himself.

20:44.384 --> 20:48.218
You guys, it doesn't make sense.
Cars don't just spontaneously combust.

20:48.388 --> 20:51.653
- The cops said it was faulty wiring.
- I've already got my headline:

20:51.825 --> 20:54.293
"Jockstrap Saves Principal
From Burning Car!"

20:54.461 --> 20:56.395
Will you lay off the "jockstraps" thing?

20:56.563 --> 20:59.589
I can't believe Clark's been blinded
by the Friday-night lights.

20:59.766 --> 21:02.030
I joined a football team, not a cult.

21:02.202 --> 21:04.670
Next thing you know,
I'll be joining the pom-pom brigade.

21:04.838 --> 21:08.535
- I hear there's a spot open.
- Lana, what are you doing here?

21:08.708 --> 21:11.336
- Taking your order, I hope.
- What-? What is this?

21:11.511 --> 21:15.504
Some sort of a cheerleading charity, like,
be-a-waitress-for-a-night sort of thing?

21:15.682 --> 21:19.049
Yes it is, except for the cheerleading
and charity parts.

21:19.219 --> 21:21.881
And tips are always appreciated.

21:22.489 --> 21:26.858
- So you're a waitress for real?
- Even got the perky nametag to prove it.

21:27.026 --> 21:29.460
- First day?
- Ever.

21:29.629 --> 21:31.358
Where's your necklace?

21:31.965 --> 21:35.025
Strict dress code.
No jewelry and no open-toed shoes.

21:36.136 --> 21:38.070
You look very waitresslike.

21:38.638 --> 21:42.199
If I could only tell the difference between
a half-caf decaf and a nonfat latte.

21:42.375 --> 21:46.539
- In that case, I'll have a regular coffee.
- Hey. Times three.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.582
Lana, you forgot this.

21:51.751 --> 21:54.618
Thanks.
That's been happening a lot today.

21:54.788 --> 21:56.949
First days are always rough.

21:57.123 --> 21:58.886
So you just quit cheerleading?

21:59.159 --> 22:00.421
You sound surprised.

22:00.593 --> 22:03.892
Well, it's not like you broke
any state laws or anything, but I am.

22:04.063 --> 22:06.657
- You always seemed happy doing it.
- My mom was a cheerleader.

22:06.833 --> 22:10.564
So was my aunt. Figured it was time
to break the vicious cycle.

22:12.238 --> 22:13.705
What did Whitney say?

22:14.541 --> 22:16.907
You're his teammate now.
Why don't you ask him?

22:18.812 --> 22:22.179
You know, it's amazing. The same day
I make the team, you quit the squad.

22:22.682 --> 22:24.877
I was just hoping
we'd see more of each other.

22:25.151 --> 22:28.348
I have four shifts a week.
You can stop by anytime you like.

22:29.355 --> 22:32.756
Lana, table three's been waiting
for their drinks for five minutes.

22:32.926 --> 22:34.894
If they go cold, it comes out of your tips.

22:35.061 --> 22:39.521
- Right. Sorry.
- Don't be sorry, just be faster.

22:44.037 --> 22:48.303
Clark Kent is a football player,
and Lana Lang is a waitress.

22:48.708 --> 22:51.074
- What's the matter with that?
- Nothing.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.940
I just want to click my heels
and get back to reality.

22:58.184 --> 23:01.449
Coach says he needs to see us
on the field right now.

23:05.825 --> 23:07.554
What's up with your fallen brethren?

23:07.827 --> 23:09.454
I don't know.

23:10.096 --> 23:11.893
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:12.532 --> 23:15.865
- Chloe...?
- Relax. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

23:16.035 --> 23:17.502
Bye.

23:28.915 --> 23:31.577
Congratulations.
I've never seen a group of young men...

23:31.751 --> 23:34.276
...demonstrate
such extraordinary stupidity.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.979
Now, which one of you talked?

23:38.024 --> 23:43.792
No one here told Kwan
that I supplied you with that test?

23:43.963 --> 23:47.922
Coach, no college is even gonna look at us
with cheating on our record.

23:51.804 --> 23:53.431
So it was you, Trevor?

23:54.707 --> 23:57.767
Now, why doesn't that surprise me?

24:08.187 --> 24:14.558
Nothing! Nothing is gonna stand
between me and my legacy!

24:14.861 --> 24:19.560
Now, you go home
and keep your mouths shut, understand?

24:19.732 --> 24:22.496
- Yes. Sure thing, coach.
- Yes, sir.

24:38.217 --> 24:42.153
Congratulations, Lex,
you made the Business page for once.

24:42.322 --> 24:44.722
I told Dominic I was doing this
two days ago.

24:44.891 --> 24:47.587
Yes, and my drone
dutifully reported it to me.

24:48.861 --> 24:51.489
I just didn't think you'd be stupid enough
to implement it.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.723
If you had a problem,
why didn't you call me?

24:54.267 --> 24:57.430
We have a reporting structure.
Just because you're my son...

24:57.604 --> 25:00.903
- ... don't expect any special treatment.
- Believe me, I never have.

25:01.074 --> 25:04.168
That wounded-pride routine
may have worked for your mother...

25:04.344 --> 25:06.835
...but don't try it with me.

25:09.115 --> 25:11.379
You know perfectly well
how I feel about you.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.451
Hence I'm at a crap factory in Smallville.

25:13.620 --> 25:16.748
Lex, did you know the caesars
would send their sons...

25:16.923 --> 25:19.187
...to the furthermost corners
of the empire...

25:19.359 --> 25:22.920
...so they could get an appreciation
of how the world works?

25:23.596 --> 25:25.461
Whatever helps you sleep at night, Dad.

25:27.867 --> 25:33.066
All right, here's how I propose
we solve our impasse.

25:36.676 --> 25:40.043
We'll fence for it.
If you win, I'll let you pursue your plan.

25:40.213 --> 25:44.445
If I win,
you fire 20 percent of your work force.

25:44.617 --> 25:47.313
The question you have to ask yourself,
Lex, is...

25:48.488 --> 25:50.581
...are you good enough
to take your old man?

26:07.640 --> 26:11.576
Look at your moves, Lex. They're rash,
no thought to their consequences.

26:11.744 --> 26:14.110
If I wanted a commentary,
I'd buy your books on tape.

26:15.515 --> 26:18.006
- You know what your problem is?
- Enlighten me.

26:18.184 --> 26:22.086
You're ruled by your emotions.
You always have been.

26:23.923 --> 26:26.653
And that can be a fatal flaw.

26:30.296 --> 26:33.663
I want those workers gone
by noon tomorrow.

26:34.834 --> 26:37.928
Meeting adjourned.

26:53.820 --> 26:57.722
- Heading out to the pep rally?
- How do I look?

26:57.890 --> 26:59.858
As handsome as your father.

27:00.093 --> 27:02.152
- You don't have to do this, Mom.
- Do what?

27:02.328 --> 27:03.693
Play Kent family peacekeeper.

27:03.863 --> 27:07.890
Well, if the Kent men weren't so stubborn,
I wouldn't have to.

27:08.201 --> 27:10.965
- So you're taking Dad's side?
- No, Clark, I'm not.

27:11.137 --> 27:14.163
- I told him he's being unreasonable.
- Thanks.

27:14.373 --> 27:16.671
I'm not saying you're entirely innocent
either.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.333
If you want to make decisions...

27:18.511 --> 27:21.912
...you need to be prepared
to live with your mistakes.

27:22.081 --> 27:23.378
You trust me, don't you?

27:25.451 --> 27:29.911
I want to, Clark. So does your dad.

27:30.089 --> 27:32.250
Just give him a chance.

27:35.061 --> 27:38.997
<i>Come on, Crows, let's go
Come on, Crows, let's go, let's go</i>

27:50.877 --> 27:52.936
Why'd you call me? What do you want?

27:53.112 --> 27:56.172
I want to know if Coach Walt
supplied the players with the tests.

27:56.983 --> 27:58.883
If you don't want to get hurt,
leave this alone.

27:59.051 --> 28:01.019
Look, you can talk to me now or later.

28:01.187 --> 28:04.122
<i>Either way, this picture's on the front page
of tomorrow's Torch.</i>

28:10.663 --> 28:12.130
Just leave me alone.

28:26.579 --> 28:30.413
Talking to the school newspaper, Trevor?
I thought you were brighter than that.

28:30.583 --> 28:34.519
Coach, I didn't say anything.
You've got to believe me!

28:34.687 --> 28:37.884
She was at the field last night,
got a picture of us in the sprinklers!

28:41.260 --> 28:42.955
All right.

28:44.297 --> 28:47.789
Go home. I'll take care of this.

29:22.201 --> 29:25.466
- Hey, you seen Chloe?
- No.

29:32.478 --> 29:33.672
Clark!

29:57.603 --> 29:58.695
Oh, my God!

29:59.639 --> 30:00.833
Chloe!

30:03.743 --> 30:06.712
- Chloe!
- Clark!

30:22.094 --> 30:25.894
<i>The Torch torched.
How's that for dramatic irony?</i>

30:26.065 --> 30:29.762
- Just trying to get you to smile.
- This is more than arson, Clark.

30:29.936 --> 30:31.927
It's like the fire knew what I was doing.

30:32.104 --> 30:34.299
You believe Coach Walt
was somehow controlling it?

30:34.473 --> 30:35.735
Look at the facts.

30:35.908 --> 30:38.604
Kwan launches an investigation
into the cheating scandal.

30:38.778 --> 30:40.302
Coach tries to fry him in his car.

30:40.479 --> 30:44.415
One of his players comes forward, and he
threatens them with pyrotechnic sprinklers.

30:44.583 --> 30:47.211
<i>I'm about to print the picture,
and the Torch goes up in flames.</i>

30:47.386 --> 30:50.787
You think he's behind the cheating scandal?
Come on, Chloe.

30:50.957 --> 30:53.152
Coach obsessed with winning
his 200th game...

30:53.326 --> 30:56.090
...helps bonehead players pass test
to secure his position...

30:56.262 --> 30:58.492
...in the pantheon of high-school sports.

30:59.966 --> 31:03.868
- Do you have another copy of the picture?
- No, it's kind of hard to recover the files.

31:04.036 --> 31:06.561
- We don't have any proof.
- Trevor Chapell.

31:06.872 --> 31:08.703
What about him?

31:08.874 --> 31:11.741
I'm sure he talked to Kwan
about the cheating.

31:11.944 --> 31:15.004
He wants to talk, I know it,
but he's still scared to talk to me...

31:15.181 --> 31:17.649
...but I think he might open up to you.

31:27.460 --> 31:31.988
Lana! What happened?
Did Nell put you out on the street?

31:32.198 --> 31:35.065
- I decided to join the work force.
- Good for you.

31:35.234 --> 31:37.361
You'll be employee of the month
in no time.

31:37.536 --> 31:41.097
Right now I hold the record
for most dishes broken in a single day.

31:41.874 --> 31:45.366
Better bring my cappuccino
in a Styrofoam cup, then.

31:48.547 --> 31:51.141
Well, if it isn't Smallville's
latest football star.

31:51.350 --> 31:54.342
Let's see how I do tomorrow night.
Have you seen Trevor tonight?

31:54.587 --> 31:57.351
- No, he hasn't been in.
- How are things going here?

31:57.523 --> 32:00.549
Today is one of those days
I just want to scream.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.758
Well, for what it's worth,
I think it's cool you got this job.

32:03.996 --> 32:08.126
For what it's worth, I'm sorry I'm
not gonna get to see you play tomorrow.

32:08.300 --> 32:09.790
New girl gets the worst shifts.

32:10.336 --> 32:12.896
- Can I get you anything?
- May I have a cup of coffee?

32:13.172 --> 32:15.538
- Coming right up.
- Thanks.

32:16.876 --> 32:19.470
Rumor has it Clark Kent
joined the football team.

32:19.745 --> 32:23.647
- Rumor's true.
- Congratulations. Your dad must be thrilled.

32:23.816 --> 32:26.307
Actually, he freaked out
and told me I couldn't play.

32:26.752 --> 32:30.017
I'm surprised with my dad. He claims
I should make my own decisions...

32:30.189 --> 32:32.714
...but then when I do, he shuts me down.

32:32.892 --> 32:35.827
And you're out late, waiting for him
to go to bed so you can avoid...

32:35.995 --> 32:38.395
...the uncomfortable silence
when you get home.

32:38.564 --> 32:40.464
- How'd you know?
- The Luthors wrote the book...

32:40.633 --> 32:42.828
...on uncomfortable silences.

32:45.204 --> 32:47.172
What are you working on?

32:47.440 --> 32:50.170
I'm trying to figure out
which poor bastards should get the ax.

32:50.342 --> 32:52.810
My father wants me to cut
20% of my work force.

32:53.279 --> 32:55.839
- Any way around it?
- Once my father's made his mind up...

32:56.015 --> 32:59.746
- ... he's not easy to turn around.
- If it makes you guys feel any better...

32:59.919 --> 33:02.513
...you should have seen my aunt's face
when I took this job.

33:03.255 --> 33:05.985
Not that I was eavesdropping or anything.

33:06.592 --> 33:09.584
- I guess we're all in the same boat.
- No. You both stood your ground...

33:09.762 --> 33:11.821
...and are doing what you want.
I caved.

33:13.966 --> 33:15.365
You two have inspired me.

33:16.469 --> 33:19.768
Oh, yeah, joining the football team
and pouring some coffee.

33:19.939 --> 33:23.306
- We're a couple of real rebels.
- Long live the revolution.

33:26.712 --> 33:28.111
How is it?

33:29.448 --> 33:31.439
It's perfect.

33:34.019 --> 33:37.352
- Is that what you ordered?
- Not even close.

33:44.196 --> 33:49.099
Trevor, it's Clark Kent.
I'm here to talk.

33:49.268 --> 33:51.998
Just leave or he'll come back.

33:52.605 --> 33:54.129
Coach Walt?

33:55.341 --> 33:59.038
- Once he gets angry-
- What did he do to you?

34:01.180 --> 34:06.812
Coach rides me pretty hard, you know,
me and some of the others.

34:06.986 --> 34:11.581
Thinks he's our father or something.
That's how he justifies it, anyway.

34:11.991 --> 34:15.188
Once when I dropped a pass,
he drove me home, punched me in the gut...

34:15.360 --> 34:18.159
- ... told me not to do it again.
- Why didn't you tell anyone?

34:18.330 --> 34:21.993
Coach said he'd throw me off the team,
wouldn't help me pass my classes.

34:22.601 --> 34:25.364
Did he give you that math midterm?

34:29.308 --> 34:31.742
- Trevor, I can help.
- That's what Principal Kwan said.

34:31.911 --> 34:33.572
Look what coach did to him.

34:35.947 --> 34:39.349
- What happened to your arm?
- It's nothing. It's a carburetor burn.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.208
It's nothing.

34:42.521 --> 34:43.886
Let me see it, Trevor.

35:03.576 --> 35:06.636
I don't know how coach did it,
but if I talk, he's gonna fry me.

35:14.353 --> 35:17.447
Kent, why aren't you in the locker room
suiting up?

35:17.623 --> 35:20.592
I'm not walking out on that field,
and neither are you.

35:21.827 --> 35:24.091
Look, I don't know what the hell
your problem is...

35:24.263 --> 35:27.664
...but you do not want
to tick me off right now.

35:38.110 --> 35:42.945
- I saw what you did to Trevor's arm.
- Trevor should have kept his mouth shut!

35:44.316 --> 35:47.649
What's the matter, Kent?
A little too hot for you, huh?

35:55.494 --> 35:59.260
Well, excuse me now.
I've got a game to win.

36:27.860 --> 36:31.819
Blue, 32! Hike!

36:41.440 --> 36:44.671
- Chloe.
- Hi, Mrs. Kent. Hi, Mr. Kent.

36:45.010 --> 36:47.274
Smallville's resident cynic
have a change of heart?

36:47.579 --> 36:50.946
Well, I decided to put my personal politics
aside to support my friends.

36:51.116 --> 36:53.311
Yes, we're trying the same philosophy.

36:53.485 --> 36:54.918
- Where's Clark?
- I don't know.

36:55.087 --> 36:58.113
I was supposed to meet him, but he didn't
show. I thought he was with you.

37:23.015 --> 37:25.643
- Hey, Pete. Pete.
- Hey.

37:25.818 --> 37:28.582
- Have you seen Clark?
- No, haven't seen him all day.

37:28.754 --> 37:31.348
Jonathan, you know the rules,
no parents on the sidelines.

37:31.523 --> 37:34.390
- I'm looking for Clark.
- Well, join the club. I need him out here.

37:34.560 --> 37:37.586
Guess he doesn't have what it takes
to be a winner, huh?

37:42.935 --> 37:46.393
- Nobody's seen him.
- I think the coach is lying.

37:46.572 --> 37:50.008
What's going on here, Chloe?

37:50.175 --> 37:52.735
All right, I'll check the locker room.
You check the school.

37:53.045 --> 37:54.171
I'll be back in five.

37:54.413 --> 37:58.213
- We're in the middle of a game here.
- Just call the damn plays!

38:17.169 --> 38:18.966
Clark!

38:20.339 --> 38:21.966
Clark!

38:28.580 --> 38:33.449
Clark! Clark! Clark!

38:34.386 --> 38:36.047
Come on!

38:39.525 --> 38:42.323
- Can you hear me? Are you all right?
- It's the meteor rocks.

38:42.628 --> 38:46.223
Come on. Come on.

39:05.818 --> 39:09.686
- Coach, you need help.
- What I need is to win this game.

39:09.855 --> 39:11.823
It's too late for that.

39:28.740 --> 39:30.367
How'd you do that?

39:32.211 --> 39:34.202
It's in the genes.

39:42.454 --> 39:44.945
Give it up, coach. You've lost.

40:00.939 --> 40:04.067
Two trips in one week. I'm flattered, Dad.

40:04.710 --> 40:07.440
- What is this?
- It's my new proposal.

40:07.613 --> 40:11.674
I cut the operating budget by 20%
without losing a single job.

40:11.917 --> 40:15.045
Lex, I specifically told you
to cut your work force.

40:15.220 --> 40:17.620
Why? With this plan,
you don't get the bad PR.

40:19.057 --> 40:21.252
That's not the point.

40:22.127 --> 40:25.096
Careful, Dad, you're getting emotional.

40:27.032 --> 40:29.159
We could always try a rematch.

40:29.334 --> 40:31.268
Are you afraid you can't take
your son again?

40:33.005 --> 40:35.530
- You get one.
- One what?

40:35.707 --> 40:37.231
One chance to defy me.

40:40.112 --> 40:42.546
I can't figure out what you hate more...

40:42.714 --> 40:45.979
...the fact that my plan works
or that you didn't come up with it first.

40:46.451 --> 40:49.545
Just remember:
Empires aren't built on clever bookkeeping.

40:49.788 --> 40:53.315
Dad, you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

40:59.097 --> 41:01.497
Sorry you didn't get to play.

41:01.700 --> 41:04.362
Were you here to make sure
I didn't hurt anyone?

41:04.803 --> 41:08.068
I was here to support my son.

41:11.043 --> 41:15.377
Some of the things I said were out of line.

41:15.981 --> 41:19.747
Look, I do trust you, Clark, I do.

41:19.918 --> 41:23.979
I guess there's always gonna be
a part of me that's a little bit afraid...

41:24.790 --> 41:27.384
...but that's just being a parent.

41:29.227 --> 41:30.455
Thanks, Dad.

41:40.305 --> 41:42.364
Peaceful, isn't it?

41:42.808 --> 41:48.178
- Hey, thought you were working.
- I got let go.

41:48.347 --> 41:53.148
- Apparently, I'm not waitress material.
- Sorry.

41:53.552 --> 41:55.213
How'd your aunt take it?

41:55.387 --> 42:00.586
She said that it was a sign that I should
seriously reconsider cheerleading.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.988
Parents, what are you gonna do?

42:04.763 --> 42:07.698
I heard about the coach. Pretty weird.

42:07.866 --> 42:11.927
He won his 200th game
and didn't even see it.

42:12.337 --> 42:14.532
Are you gonna play next season?

42:15.607 --> 42:17.598
I don't know if football's for me.

42:17.776 --> 42:21.303
I mean, my dad played,
my granddad played.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.313
I think it's time to break the vicious cycle.

42:24.716 --> 42:27.549
Pretty short career.
Why the change of heart?

42:27.719 --> 42:28.947
I don't know.

42:29.154 --> 42:32.783
Guess I got out on the field and realized
my reason for playing was gone.

42:35.894 --> 42:37.293
I'm sorry to hear that.

42:42.334 --> 42:43.562
Who said life was fair?

42:45.504 --> 42:46.801
Gonna be okay?

42:48.240 --> 42:49.901
Sometimes I just want to scream.

42:52.144 --> 42:55.545
- Why don't we?
- Why don't we what?

42:55.714 --> 43:00.879
- Scream. I'm game if you are.
- You serious?

43:01.186 --> 43:03.051
Why not?

43:04.289 --> 43:06.280
On three.

43:06.658 --> 43:10.890
One... two... three.
