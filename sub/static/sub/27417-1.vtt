WEBVTT

00:05.600 --> 00:06.200
- Yo.

00:06.233 --> 00:07.133
You know who I am, innit?

00:07.167 --> 00:10.067
- Everyone knows you, Dushane.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.600
Listen, we're your
family now.

00:12.633 --> 00:15.067
Think of all these lot as your
cousins, you get me?

00:16.867 --> 00:18.067
Say something.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.667
We done warned you about Kamale
and them London Fields, man.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.533
We should have just killed him
when we had the chance.

00:23.567 --> 00:25.667
Back up!

00:25.700 --> 00:27.433
You need to start talking
right now, bruv.

00:27.467 --> 00:29.767
I need to know where
that food is, G.

00:31.767 --> 00:33.233
Let me out, please.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.000
Man, please, man.

00:34.033 --> 00:36.000
Come on, let me out.

00:36.600 --> 00:37.133
What you doing?

00:37.167 --> 00:38.733
What do you want now?

00:38.767 --> 00:40.067
You're nothing.

00:42.467 --> 00:44.067
Somebody get the
ambulance!

00:44.100 --> 00:46.300
I didn't mean for it to happen.
He showed up.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.400
We got into it.

00:47.433 --> 00:48.600
I don't even remember pulling
the trigger, bruv.

00:48.633 --> 00:49.600
From now on, yeah,

00:49.633 --> 00:52.333
things are gonna run
differently around here.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.567
You wanna do business or not?

00:57.833 --> 00:59.467
It's done.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.567
One of the
workmen found the body.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.233
Payday.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.000
Big payday.

02:50.533 --> 02:52.333
How are you gonna spend it?

02:52.367 --> 02:54.833
You got any plans?

02:54.867 --> 02:58.133
- I might buy myself
some trainers.

02:59.133 --> 03:00.767
- It's the first thing women
look at, innit?

03:00.800 --> 03:02.233
- Yeah.

03:03.467 --> 03:06.500
Some kind of fetish?

03:06.533 --> 03:10.067
You've got the trainers,
you've got the money.

03:13.433 --> 03:17.567
Ah, here comes Sinbad the
Sailor, with our ship coming in.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.233
You stay here.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.467
It's illegal for a black man

03:20.500 --> 03:22.533
to be within five miles
of a marina.

03:32.433 --> 03:34.233
How'd it go, then, Sinbad?

03:50.067 --> 03:51.800
- The whole fecking lot.

03:51.833 --> 03:53.600
Ten keys.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.567
That's a million quid,
my boy.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.367
Welcome to the big time.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.567
- Hey, hey, hey.

04:22.767 --> 04:24.100
You know what we come for.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.667
Watch him, Mike.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.767
How much in here?
- 2,000.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.100
- Here, come see.

04:32.133 --> 04:33.800
- Got two bags in here.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.267
Light work.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.333
What?

04:40.367 --> 04:41.400
Too easy.

04:42.100 --> 04:42.600
Oi!

04:42.633 --> 04:44.067
Wheres the rest?

04:55.633 --> 04:57.600
You wanted to see me?

04:57.633 --> 04:59.233
- Me that wants to see you, fam.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.633
- We want food.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.133
We ain't got nothing
in Fields, fam.

05:03.167 --> 05:05.033
- That's your problem.
- Your problem as well.

05:05.067 --> 05:07.167
- Blood, I just told you.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.300
We ain't got nothing in
Fields, innit?

05:09.333 --> 05:12.333
Like, I don't know what the
mandems gonna do next.

05:12.367 --> 05:13.433
Probably get up
and take the food

05:13.467 --> 05:15.233
from the people that do have it.

05:15.267 --> 05:16.067
You feel me, fam?

05:16.100 --> 05:18.333
You trying to make threats,
Trevor?

05:18.367 --> 05:19.533
I'm not making no threats,
blood.

05:19.567 --> 05:20.833
You need to drop two boxes on
me, innit?

05:20.867 --> 05:23.333
Bruv, you ain't got the people
to move two boxes, so what you

05:23.367 --> 05:25.667
talking about?

05:25.700 --> 05:27.467
Course I got that, blood.
I've got a buyer for one.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.800
I'll move the other one
myself, fam.

05:29.667 --> 05:30.400
- Yeah.

05:30.433 --> 05:32.233
They're getting the money now.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.267
- Lying bastard.
- Aargh!

05:40.333 --> 05:41.500
Come on, Mike.

05:41.533 --> 05:43.167
We're in business.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.233
- You know two boxes is 70, fam.
70 bags?

05:47.533 --> 05:50.133
- That's way too much, rude boy.
- Bruv listen, that's the price.

05:50.167 --> 05:52.200
I'm telling you now. 70.

05:52.233 --> 05:53.600
- All right. Say no more.

05:53.633 --> 05:55.467
Just make sure man comes with
the food.

05:56.133 --> 05:57.133
Yeah?

05:59.333 --> 06:00.667
You gonna shot them our
food, fam?

06:00.700 --> 06:03.067
My man's got a big shipment
coming in.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.633
We need to get rid of this food,
soon as.

06:04.667 --> 06:07.367
Don't really wanna be
warring with them, man.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.000
Not yet, anyway.

06:17.267 --> 06:18.433
- Get up.

06:19.533 --> 06:20.600
Come on, get up.

06:20.633 --> 06:21.633
- No.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.000
- Get up. Stand up.

06:25.867 --> 06:28.567
Stand up.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.200
Erin.

06:30.233 --> 06:31.433
Stand up.

06:35.467 --> 06:37.700
Look this way. Turn around.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.633
Good girl.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.567
- Hey.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.167
How you doing?
- Cool, man.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.333
- Hello, Erin.

07:04.367 --> 07:04.867
Yeah?

07:04.900 --> 07:06.600
Say hello.
- Hello.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.367
Is she settling in?

07:09.400 --> 07:10.767
You like nursery, don't you?

07:10.800 --> 07:11.833
Yeah. She likes it.

07:11.867 --> 07:13.567
Yeah OK.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.133
Be good. Be good for mummy.
- See you later. Give me kiss.

07:16.167 --> 07:19.000
Bye bye.
- Bye.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.500
She's a proper daddy's
girl, huh?

07:22.533 --> 07:24.700
Yeah, well...
- She is, man.

07:24.733 --> 07:26.100
She loves you.

07:26.133 --> 07:27.200
Yeah, I know, man.

07:27.233 --> 07:28.567
I haven't seen her mum here yet.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.300
She off working?

07:30.333 --> 07:31.633
- She's in Jamaica at the
moment.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.133
- Mm.

07:33.167 --> 07:34.267
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.600
That's gonna be hard for her.

07:35.633 --> 07:36.800
She'll be missing her
little girl.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.667
Armed police!

07:42.700 --> 07:43.533
Stay where you are!

07:45.400 --> 07:46.167
Show us your hands!

07:46.200 --> 07:47.567
Don't move!

07:47.600 --> 07:48.233
Dris
Wright.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.100
- I am arresting you on
suspicion of the murder of

07:51.133 --> 07:57.233
Kamale Robert Lewis on
10th March 2011.

07:57.267 --> 07:58.367
Clear, ma'am.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.700
You do not have to say
anything, but it may harm your

08:00.733 --> 08:03.367
defense if you do not mention
when questioned something which

08:03.400 --> 08:05.300
you later rely on in court.

08:05.333 --> 08:08.167
But anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

08:18.133 --> 08:20.500
Listen, I got bars.

08:20.533 --> 08:24.300
No cut a guy and leave him with
stars.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.433
Listen, I saw a pith girl from
afar.

08:27.467 --> 08:30.067
Walked up, no front, no back
like a Smart car.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.367
- I was like--

08:31.400 --> 08:33.133
- Gas

08:33.167 --> 08:34.600
- It's all gas.

08:34.633 --> 08:36.667
- Listen, let me carry on, let
me carry on.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.433
I was like, 'Leave that.'

08:38.467 --> 08:40.667
She smiled I was like,
'Bitch, where your teeth at?'

08:40.700 --> 08:43.033
- Shit.
- I go to a club with no ID,

08:43.067 --> 08:45.067
Bring the heat to the way, but I
aint Wiley.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.133
- Oh, shut up, man.

08:46.167 --> 08:48.500
- First try and catch me when
they come find me.

08:48.533 --> 08:51.167
When I see a fiend I'm
passin the crinack...

08:52.600 --> 08:54.700
The girl says she loves me while
she's on my dinack.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.300
- Crack.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.167
- Oh, my days!

08:59.200 --> 09:00.133
- Dick, fam.

09:00.167 --> 09:00.700
- Dickhead.

09:00.733 --> 09:01.500
- This prayer's dumb.

09:01.533 --> 09:03.467
What you making up new words
for?

09:03.500 --> 09:05.167
Slang's going too far nowadays.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.233
You're whack, bruv.

09:07.267 --> 09:08.467
You can do better than that?

09:08.500 --> 09:12.167
- Go on, go on.
- Dumb kid. Fourfoot munchkin.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.767
The way he's looking at
R-Marni's like he wants to

09:13.800 --> 09:15.300
bum him.
- Ooh!

09:15.333 --> 09:17.400
About money, I get all they
guap.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.833
And that chipmunk voice is cos
his balls ain't dropped.

09:22.267 --> 09:26.033
- Wait. He don't wanna bum me.
He don't wanna bum me.

09:26.067 --> 09:28.133
- Blood, I dont know what you
two do in your spare time.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.000
- Hey, yo.

09:31.833 --> 09:32.833
- Yo!

09:32.867 --> 09:35.767
What are you looking at?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.267
Cuz, what you looking at?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.500
- Hey, come over here.

09:39.533 --> 09:41.600
Come over here, man.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.067
Hurry up.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.100
What's your name?

09:44.133 --> 09:47.200
- Jason.
Where you from?

09:47.233 --> 09:48.467
What are you doing over here?

09:49.800 --> 09:50.867
- I wasn't spying.

09:50.900 --> 09:51.767
- Ay, leave him alone.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.033
- I wasn't spying.
- No fucking spying.

09:54.067 --> 09:54.733
You stink as well.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.200
- Yo, blood, leave him.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.500
No, man. In Mexico that
little dickhead...

09:58.533 --> 10:00.667
- Oi, fuck you!
You little--

10:00.700 --> 10:01.833
- Hey!

10:01.867 --> 10:04.033
- No, blood, in Mexico a man
would be hanging dead on a

10:04.067 --> 10:05.300
lamppost, bruv.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.100
It'd be like walking down
Hackney seeing bare

10:07.133 --> 10:08.800
dead bodies on a lamppost.

10:08.833 --> 10:09.900
Body on a lamppost.

10:09.933 --> 10:13.267
Yo, fam, are we working today or
what

10:13.300 --> 10:15.700
Don't know, blood. Man ain't
picking up his phone, innit?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.500
The solicitor say we can't
sue the doctor, even though he

10:20.533 --> 10:22.433
ruined my eye, you know.

10:22.467 --> 10:24.633
- Well, thats outrageous.
Why not?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.267
- She say these things
happen.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.833
- Mmm.

10:27.867 --> 10:30.733
- You wanna sack that, man.
- Well, that's what my son says.

10:30.767 --> 10:33.633
- Well, your son's got a point.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.633
How many kids have you got,
Henry?

10:36.667 --> 10:39.800
Six or seven.

10:39.833 --> 10:42.533
- You must've been a very
naughty boy.

10:42.567 --> 10:45.167
- No, the woman took
advantage of me.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.167
But I look after all of them.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.633
- No, man.

10:48.667 --> 10:51.300
- Oh, man. Come on.
Come on.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.167
Come on, get out, man.
- Put this on.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.733
You can't go round like that.

10:57.100 --> 10:59.133
- The post office closed last
Easter.

10:59.167 --> 11:01.733
- I'm calling the feds.
- Don't call the feds, Zoe.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.300
Call an ambulance.
- Cover up.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.600
Oh, man.
- Look, babe, here, cover
yourself--

11:05.633 --> 11:07.600
All right, all right,

11:07.633 --> 11:11.333
come, come!
Get out. Get out, go on.

11:11.367 --> 11:12.367
Get out.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.633
Only in Summerhouse, man.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.300
You all right, Lis?

11:20.333 --> 11:22.333
What? Yeah, yeah.

11:50.767 --> 11:53.300
Oi. What's going on?

11:53.333 --> 11:55.300
You lot having a party or
something, yeah?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.733
Blood, Dris ain't turned up.

11:58.767 --> 12:01.467
- That man loves his bed,
innit?

12:01.500 --> 12:02.133
Do you want me to go to his
house?

12:02.167 --> 12:03.333
I'll wake him up, you know.

12:03.367 --> 12:05.700
No, it's all right.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.200
Yo, bruv.

12:09.233 --> 12:11.800
Get down here now, man.

12:11.833 --> 12:13.600
Oi, you know Jenny's
auntie?

12:13.633 --> 12:14.633
- Mmm.
- You know where she lives,
yeah?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.767
- Uh huh.
- That's where the food is
today.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.567
You lot are in charge till Dris
comes back.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.533
Call me if there's any problems.

12:20.567 --> 12:21.833
- All right, bro.
- Cool, man.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.300
Michael.
- Yo, bruv.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.233
Come here, man.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.733
I've got a special job for you
today still.

12:28.767 --> 12:31.167
- Yeah, bruv. Cool. Come.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.233
Later on.

12:37.167 --> 12:38.267
Hear what I'm saying,
yeah?

12:38.300 --> 12:40.500
The guy's name's Ben. I've
known Ben for a long time.

12:40.533 --> 12:43.267
He's a good customer, but
sometimes he likes to take the
piss.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.800
He wants this.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.467
That's five bills, yeah?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.100
But he's still got another six
for me.

12:48.133 --> 12:49.533
So make sure you don't give him
nothing until he gives you

12:49.567 --> 12:51.367
all the paper first, yeah?

12:51.400 --> 12:52.333
Make sure you count it.

12:52.367 --> 12:55.333
Make sure it's all there, bruv.
1,100, yeah?

12:55.367 --> 12:56.267
- Cool.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.267
- 1,100.
- All right, cool.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.433
Hey, listen, make sure you don't
let me down, you know.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.167
- I won't.
- All right, cool.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.267
Go on, get in.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.167
Oi, make sure you take care of
this boy, you know.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.467
He's my little brother.
- Yeah.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.300
I'll look after him, boss.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.833
- Take that.
- Thank you, thank you.

13:10.867 --> 13:12.467
- Michael, I'll see you in a
bit.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.100
- Show me your hands!

13:28.133 --> 13:29.500
- All right!

13:29.533 --> 13:32.333
- Dushane Hill, I'm arresting
you for the murder of Kamale
Lewis.

13:32.367 --> 13:35.100
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense--

13:46.300 --> 13:49.033
- Right, kick your shoes off,
empty your pockets

13:49.067 --> 13:50.533
and put em on the counter.

14:00.267 --> 14:02.433
That's a lot of money to be
walking round with.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.133
- Listen, let me give you one
word of advice.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.467
Dont trust the banks.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.533
- You might get mugged.

14:07.567 --> 14:09.300
- I'm being mugged right now.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.500
- You'll get a receipt.

14:10.533 --> 14:12.200
- Forget about that.
I want my solicitor.

14:12.233 --> 14:13.167
You'll get your solicitor.

14:20.700 --> 14:21.800
Come on.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.400
Is that all right?
Yeah, thanks.

15:48.367 --> 15:49.733
This Ben's yard?

15:53.200 --> 15:54.500
- My dad. Yeah.

15:54.533 --> 15:56.033
Dad.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.133
Some kid's here to see you.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.000
- Noah, go and help your mum.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.600
- I've got something for you,
innit?

16:04.633 --> 16:06.333
Do you have something for me?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.167
Jeez!

16:18.133 --> 16:20.033
Bruv, you've got a lot of books.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.067
How many books have you got?

16:22.833 --> 16:25.400
Have you read all of them?

16:25.433 --> 16:27.100
Are they history?

16:28.367 --> 16:30.600
- Here's your money.
- I got a level five in my SATs.

16:30.633 --> 16:32.300
History's my favorite subject.
- I'm impressed. Please,

16:32.333 --> 16:36.167
just give me what you came to
give me and take this and go.

16:38.267 --> 16:41.567
- Twenty, forty, sixty...
- It's all there. 500.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.400
- I'll sort that out with
Dushane later.

16:44.433 --> 16:45.833
- Naw man, I need the correct
money now.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.067
- I don't keep that kind of
money in the house.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.467
- Out.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.667
- Get off me, man.
I'm gonna scream.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.100
You're abusing me, you fucking
pedo.

16:52.133 --> 16:53.300
You best give me my money.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.300
- All right.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.000
Fuck.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.433
- Oi, RaNell!

17:32.767 --> 17:34.500
RaNell! RaNell.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.533
- I really need you, bruv.

17:36.567 --> 17:39.067
I fucked up so bad.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.133
I need your help, bruv.

17:42.167 --> 17:43.667
- Oh, for fucks sake.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.200
- Please.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.633
Rhianna Parkes.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.133
Stallbridge and Partners.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.433
- Jordan's actually out of the
country at the moment.

18:11.467 --> 18:13.633
I work closely with him, but if
you prefer another solicitor, I

18:13.667 --> 18:15.033
can contact one for you.

18:15.067 --> 18:16.267
- You work in the same firm as
him?

18:16.300 --> 18:17.833
- Yes.

18:17.867 --> 18:19.667
- It's cool.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.700
- I'd like to speak to Mr. Hill
alone.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.067
- I've never had a woman
solicitor before.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.600
- Well, some of us come stupid
and some of us come smart.

18:34.633 --> 18:36.233
We're like you that way.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.567
Why have you arrested
Mr. Hill?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.600
The grounds of
arrest have been accepted

18:40.633 --> 18:41.667
by the custody sergeant,

18:41.700 --> 18:44.700
and that's all I want to tell
you at this stage.

18:49.300 --> 18:54.767
What was your involvement in the
murder of Kamale Lewis?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.667
- I know nothing about it.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.767
Not guilty of it and I wasn't
involved.

19:00.067 --> 19:02.533
- Mr. Hill formally asserted his
innocence and I would like to

19:02.567 --> 19:05.133
formally place, for the record,
my advice that he make no

19:05.167 --> 19:08.233
further comment during this
interview.

19:09.367 --> 19:10.533
- No comment.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.533
- Did you ever meet Kamale
Lewis?

19:12.567 --> 19:13.533
- No comment.

19:13.567 --> 19:14.733
- Dris Wright.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.167
You know that name?

19:16.200 --> 19:17.133
- No comment.

19:17.167 --> 19:19.733
- Gerard John Sullivan, also
known as Sully.

19:19.767 --> 19:20.633
Know that name?

19:20.667 --> 19:24.700
He a friend of yours?

19:24.733 --> 19:28.333
Are you the leader of the
Summerhouse drugs gang?

19:28.367 --> 19:30.733
- You lot are obsessed with
gangs, innit?

19:30.767 --> 19:33.300
There is no gangs.

19:33.333 --> 19:34.800
What is
there?

19:34.833 --> 19:36.667
- What there is everywhere else.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.033
Friends, family.

19:39.067 --> 19:40.700
- Are you the leader of the
Summerhouse family?

19:40.733 --> 19:44.200
Summerhouse family?

19:44.233 --> 19:46.400
You lot watch too much
American movies, man.

19:46.433 --> 19:49.367
- You ever sold drugs or asked
others to sell drugs for you?

19:49.400 --> 19:51.367
- You've already put this
question to my client and he's

19:51.400 --> 19:54.100
given you a definitive answer.

19:54.133 --> 19:55.633
Now move on.

19:57.067 --> 19:57.733
What happened?

19:58.700 --> 19:59.833
Was it the water?

20:01.167 --> 20:02.800
- Well, something's killed em.

20:02.833 --> 20:05.667
- I tested the PH every day
and it's cool.

20:05.700 --> 20:08.500
I've even put the right
amount of food in.

20:08.533 --> 20:11.400
Can't have anything to do
with the water.

20:13.867 --> 20:17.367
The cutters are supposed to be
coming Friday.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.333
- Well, that ain't gonna happen.

20:20.367 --> 20:22.400
- Well, what am I supposed
to do?

20:27.067 --> 20:28.133
Shit.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.333
- Here, big man.

20:30.367 --> 20:31.800
Three on two, yeah?

20:50.333 --> 20:51.333
All right.

20:53.833 --> 20:54.633
- Three on two.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.067
- Three on two.
- Put your hand down, man.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.600
I can't hear what you're saying.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.467
- Try saying it normal.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.500
- Ain't got time for this shit,
man.

21:03.533 --> 21:06.033
This kid isn't serious, man.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.800
Always putting the mic up.

21:08.833 --> 21:11.000
Why does he fucking do that?

21:13.633 --> 21:15.133
- Look at this youth, man.

21:15.167 --> 21:16.300
How could you go out looking
like that?

21:16.333 --> 21:17.233
Ain't you got no money?

21:18.300 --> 21:21.300
- Can you see through my
pocket?
- Leave it, man.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.333
- Pussy.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.533
- Here.
- Cheers.

21:36.433 --> 21:37.733
- Hello, Mr Mustapha.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.700
Yes, please.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.100
- Here you are.

21:47.133 --> 21:48.600
Here you go.

21:48.633 --> 21:51.133
Don't be late home, yeah?
- Yes, Dad.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.300
Burger and chips,
please.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.567
- Tell him it was a plague of
locusts.

22:29.767 --> 22:31.300
- You know, like in the Bible.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.300
The Egyptians.

22:32.333 --> 22:33.500
All them frogs.

22:33.533 --> 22:36.067
- Why are you talking about
Egyptians, bruv?

22:36.100 --> 22:38.300
Vincent ain't gonna
believe that.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.033
- I'm just saying, man.

22:40.067 --> 22:43.067
Frogs are evil at plant farms.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.100
- You ain't taking this serious,
RaNell, bruv.

22:45.133 --> 22:47.233
This is serious.

22:47.267 --> 22:49.267
- I know it's serious.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.300
- Are you gonna come
tell Vincent with me?

22:55.167 --> 22:57.533
- No, I'm not getting involved
with that, man.

23:07.067 --> 23:09.167
Do you
claim benefits?

23:09.200 --> 23:10.200
What relevance
does this have

23:10.233 --> 23:11.733
to your murder enquiry?

23:11.767 --> 23:13.733
- I'm trying to get a picture of
Mr. Hill's lifestyle.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.067
Do you claim benefits?

23:15.100 --> 23:16.433
- No.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.500
- I don't know if you've
noticed, but there ain't

23:19.533 --> 23:21.700
a lot of work around.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.533
- No.

23:24.567 --> 23:26.733
House?

23:26.767 --> 23:29.133
- No.

23:29.167 --> 23:30.600
- My clothes.

23:30.633 --> 23:32.300
You took them.

23:32.333 --> 23:33.767
Nice
clothes.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.733
How come you can afford
clothes like that?

23:36.767 --> 23:39.133
- People buy me clothes
and stuff.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.533
Girls and that.

23:40.567 --> 23:42.267
- That's very nice.
- Mmm.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.100
And I want my clothes back.

23:44.133 --> 23:46.733
Don't let me catch you walking
around in my stuff, you know.

23:46.767 --> 23:47.700
When you
were arrested,

23:47.733 --> 23:51.267
you were found to be in
possession of £345

23:51.300 --> 23:53.567
in cash. Is that your money?

23:53.600 --> 23:54.467
- Yeah.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.467
- How come you've got that
much money?

23:57.500 --> 24:00.200
- It was my birthday.

24:00.233 --> 24:03.233
- Thursday.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.733
- My client has given
you an answer.

24:07.767 --> 24:09.600
Now move on.

24:11.600 --> 24:15.233
- This interview is now
terminated.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.633
- You're being released on
police bail.

24:35.167 --> 24:37.633
That's what I'm gonna call
you, Now Move On.

24:37.667 --> 24:40.300
Put them in their
place, boy.

24:40.333 --> 24:44.100
- A satisfied client, that's
what we like.

24:44.133 --> 24:48.067
- If you let me take you out to
dinner, I'll be even more
satisfied.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.567
- No, thank you.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.567
My best guess is that they'll
put this to bed,

24:52.600 --> 24:54.167
unless they come up with
something new.

24:55.333 --> 24:56.167
- Usual things.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.133
Witness, DNA, prints.

24:59.167 --> 25:00.000
- It's not gonna happen.

25:00.033 --> 25:02.767
I wasn't there.
- Don't get complacent.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.633
They don't like you.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.800
They'll be keeping
an eye on you.

25:07.833 --> 25:09.500
- Thank you.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.367
- Wagwan.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.833
How'd they know to pick us up?

25:16.867 --> 25:17.967
- Bruv, I don't know.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.500
But don't worry about it, man.
They ain't got nothing.

25:21.533 --> 25:24.100
That guy that was with Kamale
that night

25:24.133 --> 25:26.600
got shot dead at some New Year's
party in Brixton, so he ain't

25:26.633 --> 25:28.467
saying nothing.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.133
- There' s still the girl,
though, Kayla.

25:30.167 --> 25:31.767
She saw us. She could ID us.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.533
- Yeah, but feds don't know that
we grabbed Kamale

25:33.567 --> 25:36.100
from Kayla's yard.
- Yeah.

25:36.133 --> 25:37.133
- Come.

25:41.867 --> 25:43.833
She's so beautiful.
Ain't you, Erin?

25:43.867 --> 25:45.633
You're a beautiful little girl,
aren't you?

25:45.667 --> 25:47.667
- Yeah.
- Yes!

25:47.700 --> 25:50.633
- Cheeky bitch. You're not
supposed to say that.

25:50.667 --> 25:52.667
Do you know what my name
is?

25:52.700 --> 25:54.333
Nevaeh. Say Nevaeh.

25:54.367 --> 25:56.033
- Nevaeh!
- Yeah.

25:56.067 --> 25:57.800
That's heaven spelt backwards.
Do you like it?

25:57.833 --> 25:59.700
- No.
Pith.

25:59.733 --> 26:02.067
- Why'd your mum call you
Heaven for?

26:02.100 --> 26:03.000
- Cos I'm from heaven.

26:03.033 --> 26:04.600
- You ain't getting back there.
- Shut up.

26:04.633 --> 26:05.600
Loud that, man.

26:05.633 --> 26:07.467
You hungry?
Monster Munch!

26:07.500 --> 26:09.833
You want Monster
Munch, yeah?

26:09.867 --> 26:11.500
What's going on?
Monster Munch!

26:11.533 --> 26:13.600
Yeah.
- She's so cute.

26:13.633 --> 26:14.733
I want a baby like her.

26:16.433 --> 26:17.600
- Don't swear in front of her.

26:17.633 --> 26:19.133
- Shut up, man.

26:22.800 --> 26:23.800
Don't miss me?

26:24.667 --> 26:27.567
- Yo, what go on
with the feds, man?

26:27.600 --> 26:29.767
- Harassment ting, fam,
you get me? Minor.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.500
- Fucking dickheads.

26:31.533 --> 26:33.033
- Hey, Michael.

26:36.833 --> 26:39.667
Monsters coming
to eat your rings.

26:40.733 --> 26:43.133
- I delivered that food
like you said.

26:43.167 --> 26:44.567
Made sure he gave the
correct money, innit?

26:44.600 --> 26:46.233
- Yeah.

26:46.267 --> 26:48.167
- Hey, do you know how much
books he has?

26:48.200 --> 26:49.700
He has bare books.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.500
Unbelievable.

26:51.533 --> 26:52.633
- Hear what Im saying.

26:52.667 --> 26:55.467
See, what you saw earlier on,
with the feds and that?

26:55.500 --> 26:57.600
Don't need to worry about it,
you know.

26:57.633 --> 26:59.133
I'm too smart, too quick for
them, bruv.

26:59.167 --> 27:01.133
They ain't gonna catch me,
you get me?

27:01.167 --> 27:02.500
Hold that.

27:03.467 --> 27:05.700
- Safe.
- That's your due.

27:05.733 --> 27:06.733
Bless.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.433
- Bills.

27:16.467 --> 27:17.433
All right, then.

27:17.467 --> 27:20.633
So you just want me to come like
so, come round?

27:20.667 --> 27:22.400
And you want it thin or...?
- Thin.

27:22.433 --> 27:25.033
- Yeah.

27:25.067 --> 27:26.233
- OK.

27:27.433 --> 27:29.267
Thanks, babe. Bye.

27:30.633 --> 27:32.167
She thinks she's Beyonce,

27:32.200 --> 27:34.267
- Makes a change from
Kelly Rowland, innit?

27:34.300 --> 27:35.833
You know who she favor?

27:35.867 --> 27:37.167
Susan Boyle.

27:37.200 --> 27:41.067
You're bad, you know.

27:41.100 --> 27:42.767
- Hey, hey, look at this
handsome ting.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.400
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello, Mum.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.167
- Nothing.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.767
How is that even possible?

27:50.800 --> 27:54.167
- Too busy growing.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.567
How tall you is now?
Six foot?

27:56.600 --> 27:57.567
- I dont know.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.600

Mad feet!

28:07.533 --> 28:09.367
He's got trials for the
district youth squad.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.267
Whoo whoo!

28:10.300 --> 28:13.267

28:13.300 --> 28:15.433

28:15.467 --> 28:18.100

square foot--

28:18.133 --> 28:19.600
- Excuse me.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.667
- What do you think you're
doing?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.567
- I'm developing the buildings
on this street.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.067
This building?

28:25.100 --> 28:28.533
- Well, all of em.
- They never told us.

28:28.567 --> 28:31.567
- Well, I suggest you get in
touch with the agent.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.167
Yeah.

28:41.067 --> 28:43.700
- So there'll be a mezzanine...

28:43.733 --> 28:45.300
And just through...
Yo, boss.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.033
Come out, yeah?

28:47.067 --> 28:48.367
Sorry?
What, you deaf?

28:48.400 --> 28:50.500
I said get out! Come on, just
get out now.

28:50.533 --> 28:53.167
We can do this
another time.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.200
Cheers.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.400
Who is he?

28:56.433 --> 28:59.100
Feisty little shit.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.167
It's killing me.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.300
I hate waiting on people.

30:08.833 --> 30:10.333
How long we
been here?

30:10.367 --> 30:11.567
- Fuck knows, man.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.700
Give them a call.
- Give me a pound.

30:13.733 --> 30:15.300
- I said give me a pound.

30:15.333 --> 30:17.367
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.033
- Who the fuck you talking to
- Oi, Mike.

30:20.067 --> 30:23.733
Oi, oi, Mike. Let him
go, man. Fucking hell.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.633
Fuck off, man.
- Give me a pound.

30:28.667 --> 30:31.333
Do you want me to let him kill
you or something?

30:31.367 --> 30:33.067
Behave yourself, man.
Do one.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.467
- I'll sell you these.

30:37.167 --> 30:38.433
Tissues?

30:38.467 --> 30:40.200
All right, come here.
- Mike.

30:40.233 --> 30:41.067
Fucking hell.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.767
Get off him, get
off him, get off him.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.067
What do you want?

30:44.100 --> 30:45.267
- A pound.

30:46.367 --> 30:47.633
They're 40p in the market.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.467
- You ain't in the
fucking market.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.267
Oh, my days.

30:51.300 --> 30:54.267
Look at the front on this one.
- Little prick.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.633
- Go on, then.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.500
What, I don't get the whole
packet?

30:58.533 --> 31:01.267
- The whole packets five pound.
Do you want another one?

31:01.300 --> 31:04.167
What you doing?
- He's a fucking businessman.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.533
Fucking...

31:05.567 --> 31:06.767
Fucking prick's took
my phone.

31:10.733 --> 31:12.033
- Yo, Sul.
- Yo.

31:12.067 --> 31:13.200
- Box is gonna cost you
40, fam.

31:14.367 --> 31:16.233
Bruv, you know it's 25.
That's the deal.

31:16.267 --> 31:17.767
- Look, man. Dushane put
the price up.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.433
- Blood, Dushane's the only one

31:19.467 --> 31:21.533
that's got food right now.

31:21.567 --> 31:24.300
He's your friend, ain't he?
- He ain't my friend.

31:24.333 --> 31:25.500
- Blood, there's nothing
I can do, then.

31:25.533 --> 31:27.367
It's gonna be 40.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.700
- Aight, we'll get it.

31:31.733 --> 31:33.800
- I know you and him are getting
established and that, but when

31:33.833 --> 31:37.400
you do, we should talk, fam.

31:37.433 --> 31:39.233
- Me and you starting up.

31:39.267 --> 31:40.367
Taking Dushane down, innit?

31:40.400 --> 31:41.233
- Cheers.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.567
- In a bit.
- Link up, man.

31:49.833 --> 31:52.067
- We need to make some more
paper quick.

31:52.100 --> 31:55.433
- I can't believe you let that
little prick take your phone.

32:05.433 --> 32:07.267
- The panda.

32:09.100 --> 32:10.100
- There you go.

32:12.167 --> 32:14.067
Hold it.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.333
Now go to sleep.
- No.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.400
- Yo.

32:20.433 --> 32:22.633
Hello, babe.
Is Erin still up?

32:22.667 --> 32:25.033
- Erin, it's Mum.

32:25.067 --> 32:26.100
She wants to talk to you.

32:26.133 --> 32:27.633
Here you go.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.833
- Erin, it's Mummy, darling.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.133
How are you?

32:32.167 --> 32:34.700
- Daddy got arrested.

32:34.733 --> 32:36.833
- Don't tell her that.

32:36.867 --> 32:38.600
- Oh, nothing.

32:38.633 --> 32:40.400
Don't worry about it.

32:40.433 --> 32:41.567
How you doing, anyway?

32:41.600 --> 32:43.800
- What does she mean, got
arrested?

32:43.833 --> 32:46.067
I said dont worry.
- For fuck's sake, Dris.

32:46.100 --> 32:50.200
What's happened?--

32:54.667 --> 32:56.333
Go to sleep.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.467
That's a contract.

33:10.500 --> 33:14.233
So they cant throw us out unless
we break the lease.

33:14.267 --> 33:15.667
- Here it is.

33:15.700 --> 33:18.167
The agent sent it about a couple
of months ago, remember?

33:18.200 --> 33:19.200
- Yeah, but didn't you call
them?

33:19.233 --> 33:20.700
You know how much
time I call them?

33:20.733 --> 33:22.300
You think they pick up
the phone?

33:22.333 --> 33:23.800
- I thought it was a typo.

33:23.833 --> 33:27.333
I mean, how they gonna raise the
rent by 200%?

33:27.367 --> 33:28.667
I mean, look at this place, Lis.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.833
Is it worth £960 a week?

33:30.867 --> 33:32.033
No.

33:32.067 --> 33:34.400
I mean, who else they gonna find
to pay that kind of money?

33:34.433 --> 33:38.167
- But the way that agent guy was
going on...

33:38.200 --> 33:41.400
it can't just be the money
they're interested in.

34:06.233 --> 34:08.067
What's she looking at?

34:14.733 --> 34:16.367
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.733
I'm RaNell's mum.

34:17.767 --> 34:18.767
- I know who you are.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.167
- Yeah.

34:20.200 --> 34:21.733
Look, I hope you don't mind me
asking.

34:21.767 --> 34:24.533
You know me and Zoe have got the
hair salon down the street?

34:24.567 --> 34:26.100
- Uhhuh.

34:26.133 --> 34:28.533
- Well, anyway, this man came in
today telling us they're

34:28.567 --> 34:32.167
redeveloping the whole street,
and I was wondering, you know,

34:32.200 --> 34:34.733
so many shops have closed down
here in the last year, I was

34:34.767 --> 34:37.600
wondering if you had any contact
with Monck and Damrosh,

34:37.633 --> 34:38.767
the agents?

34:38.800 --> 34:39.433
- They sent me a letter.

34:39.467 --> 34:41.067
They're tripling the rents.

34:41.100 --> 34:43.200
- Yeah, that's what they were
saying to us, but...

34:43.233 --> 34:44.533
- Hi. All ready.

34:44.567 --> 34:45.633
That's ten.

34:45.667 --> 34:46.500
Thanks.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.533
It's the church.

34:54.467 --> 34:57.433
- Yeah, the church owns the
whole street.

34:57.467 --> 34:59.467
The agents are just the agents.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.300
Now, do you want anything?

35:04.300 --> 35:05.633
- No, no, no.
It's all right.

35:05.667 --> 35:06.567
Thanks.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.800
Thank you.

35:10.633 --> 35:12.767
- If we get a pizza, like, if we
get a margherita, we share it

35:12.800 --> 35:14.133
between all of us, innit?

35:14.167 --> 35:16.767
- Bruv, I'm getting my own
pizza, cos I know you're paying
for it.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.633
Dushane's little bitch.

35:20.567 --> 35:23.800
- Yeah, let me get a large deep
pan pepperoni,

35:23.833 --> 35:26.800
garlic bread and a coke.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.100
- That's £19.40, you know.

35:29.133 --> 35:30.533
I can afford it.

35:30.567 --> 35:32.567
R

35:34.500 --> 35:36.067
- Come on, man, put your arm
down, man.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.600
- Leave him, man. Let him order
how he wants to order.

35:37.633 --> 35:40.167
- Nah, man.
Go on, R-Marni,
order, man.

35:41.067 --> 35:42.467
- Can I have a four seasons,
please?

35:42.500 --> 35:44.567
- Sure.
- Moist, you.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.800
- Um, can I get two cokes as
well?

35:46.833 --> 35:48.533
- Yep.

35:48.567 --> 35:49.400
Thank you.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.033
- Don't be Vincent.
Don't be Vincent.

35:53.067 --> 35:55.033
Please don't be Vincent.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.167
You're like an idiot.

36:01.467 --> 36:03.033
We might have to move.

36:03.067 --> 36:04.400
Move where?

36:04.433 --> 36:06.200
- Another shop, somewhere else.

36:07.867 --> 36:09.600
- No, round here's too much
money.

36:11.367 --> 36:12.733
Turn that bloody thing off.

36:12.767 --> 36:15.367
Go to sleep.

36:43.133 --> 36:44.467
- Yeah, that's better.

36:50.367 --> 36:52.133
Yo.

36:52.167 --> 36:54.167
You got a minute?

36:55.667 --> 36:57.767
So they brought you in as well,
yeah?

36:57.800 --> 36:58.800
- Yeah.

36:58.833 --> 37:01.633
So what do you want?

37:01.667 --> 37:04.133
- So you're rolling with Mike
now, yeah?

37:04.167 --> 37:06.600
With this heat, we gotta be
careful who we talk to.

37:07.433 --> 37:08.767
- Yeah.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.400
Mike's a nutter.

37:10.433 --> 37:14.133
And them nine years he done
inside ain't improved him, fam.

37:14.167 --> 37:15.500
He's a liability.

37:15.533 --> 37:17.100
Talking about a
friend of mine.

37:17.133 --> 37:18.633
- He ain't no one's friend.

37:18.667 --> 37:20.100
Just gonna land you in trouble.

37:20.133 --> 37:22.200
- Well, at least he didn't steal
from me.

37:24.133 --> 37:27.600
- You forgetting everything I
done for you?

37:27.633 --> 37:29.367
Hmm?

37:29.400 --> 37:32.167
Now you're what, top boy in
Summerhouse?

37:32.200 --> 37:33.767
Who put you there?
Me.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.167
What did I get out of it?

37:36.200 --> 37:37.533
You just took everything and
fucked me over.

37:37.567 --> 37:40.633
- I think you're the one that's
forgetting.

37:40.667 --> 37:42.500
You wouldn't be here if it
weren't for me, bruv.

37:42.533 --> 37:44.333
Yeah, you'd be dead.

37:46.867 --> 37:49.567
- You took it all for yourself,
man.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.100
That's the kind of
friend you are.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.333
Look at this, look.

37:55.367 --> 37:56.633
What the fuck do you want?

37:56.667 --> 37:57.500
- Leave him.

37:59.067 --> 38:02.767
- You know what happened, bruv,
and you know why.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.367
Take care, yeah?

38:10.067 --> 38:11.400
Let's play.

38:13.367 --> 38:15.167
It's my shot.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.633
Fuck Dushane. We're
doing our own thing.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.000
Fuck.

38:32.367 --> 38:33.667
- Hey.

38:33.700 --> 38:35.733
You avoid me.

38:45.667 --> 38:48.667
Oh, it's so cold.

38:50.433 --> 38:51.267
Hi, Rhianna.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.067
Mr. Hill is on the
phone for you.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.100
- OK. Put him through.

38:56.633 --> 38:58.333
Hello, Mr Hill.

38:58.367 --> 39:02.133
The only ones that
call me Mr. Hill are the feds.

39:03.367 --> 39:07.600
- Well, you can help me by
having dinner with me tonight.

39:07.633 --> 39:08.800
- I'm busy tonight.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.367
- Also busy.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.367
- All right, well, what about a
drink, then?

39:17.400 --> 39:18.833
Just a drink.

39:18.867 --> 39:20.033
Come on.

39:23.233 --> 39:25.100
All right, fine.

39:25.133 --> 39:26.633
A drink.

39:26.667 --> 39:27.700
- All right, cool.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.100
I'll give you a bell.

39:44.567 --> 39:46.367
- I done everything right,
Vincent.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.767
The water, the pumps,
everything.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.333
I put the right food in and
everything.

39:53.133 --> 39:55.100
- I lose money.

39:55.133 --> 39:57.000
25 grand, minimum.

39:58.133 --> 40:00.167
You have 25 grand give me?

40:03.600 --> 40:05.400
- Don't worry.

40:05.433 --> 40:08.833
I know you don't have
25 grand, huh?

40:08.867 --> 40:11.700
You don't have the big
money, right?

40:13.333 --> 40:15.733
Don't worry.

40:15.767 --> 40:17.333
All right. Well, I'd better go.

40:17.367 --> 40:19.300
I've got school.
- No, no, no.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.200
You're not going nowhere.

40:23.167 --> 40:24.667
- Hi, it's me.

40:24.700 --> 40:26.667
Rhianna, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

40:26.700 --> 40:30.133
Listen, the reason I'm calling,
I've got someone I think

40:30.167 --> 40:31.300
you'd like to meet.

40:31.333 --> 40:35.300
- He's liquid.

40:37.567 --> 40:40.167
- No, I got a phone, G.

40:41.433 --> 40:42.800
It's only a tenner.

40:42.833 --> 40:44.000
- No, it's all right, mate.

40:53.767 --> 40:55.167
- No.
- It's only £10.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.233
- No, thank you, no.

40:59.567 --> 41:00.733
Do you wanna buy a mobile?
- No, mate.

41:00.767 --> 41:02.600
- It's only a tenner.

41:37.233 --> 41:39.233
Mum?

41:58.867 --> 42:00.133
- Nothing.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.533
Come here!
- Get off me!

42:02.567 --> 42:03.800
Leave Jason alone!

42:03.833 --> 42:05.667
- Get off me!
- Come here!

42:07.467 --> 42:09.300
You fucking slag!
You fucking bitch!

42:09.333 --> 42:11.300
- He's a fucking liar!

42:11.333 --> 42:14.067
Move! Fucking move now!

42:30.100 --> 42:32.100
- I don't think so.

42:32.133 --> 42:36.633
- They can get DNA, all kinds of
shit these days.

42:36.667 --> 42:39.433
- Solicitor said they'll put it
all to bed.

42:41.467 --> 42:42.833
- She.

42:42.867 --> 42:44.833
Yeah, and I reckon she's real
good.

42:44.867 --> 42:48.400
- All the same, I don't think
you should come with me when I

42:48.433 --> 42:50.633
go to pick up the shipment.

42:50.667 --> 42:52.367
- All right.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.833
- I'll put your half somewhere
safe.

42:54.867 --> 42:56.800
- Listen, make sure you put it
somewhere really safe,

42:56.833 --> 42:57.667
you get me?

43:02.300 --> 43:06.100
- Well, funny enough, Joe, I do.

43:06.133 --> 43:11.600
I'm touched, but
you shouldn't.

43:11.633 --> 43:14.267
You shouldn't trust anybody.

43:27.333 --> 43:29.200
- I like this color.
What do you think?

43:32.300 --> 43:33.800
Well

43:57.200 --> 43:58.533
- Oh, I'm up for it.

44:00.367 --> 44:01.700
So long, Sinbad.

45:15.133 --> 45:18.833
- A guy came to see me last
week, offers me ten grand for a
hit.

45:18.867 --> 45:21.167
Jermaine Newton, lives on
Clarence Road.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.033
You know him?

45:22.067 --> 45:25.067
- I sent you message, come to my
shop.

45:25.100 --> 45:25.800
You no come.

45:27.133 --> 45:27.733
Oi!

45:27.767 --> 45:29.333
Where's my fucking phone?

45:29.367 --> 45:31.733
-So what do you do to enjoy
yourself?

45:33.533 --> 45:35.533
- You think they're gonna catch
the killer?

45:35.567 --> 45:38.067
- They ain't never catch who
done Kamale.

45:39.100 --> 45:41.433
- Bruv, they ain't gonna let
that go, you know.
