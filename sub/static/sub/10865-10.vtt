00:32.680 --> 00:33.720
Hey, what's this?

00:33.720 --> 00:35.920
Don't. 
 You'll scare him.

00:35.920 --> 00:36.920
What is it?

00:36.920 --> 00:38.640
It's spike, 
 my new pet.

00:38.640 --> 00:39.640
Spike?

00:39.640 --> 00:40.960
Cool. 
 Let's see him.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.240
Not yet. 
 He's just a baby.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.040
Strangers disturb him.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.600
Ooh, don't let him 
 see stig.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.400
He'll be disturbed 
 for life.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
Ha ha.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.240
Yeah, let's try.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.920
Later, when he's relaxed.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.920
Is it a rabbit?

00:57.920 --> 00:59.080
No.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.480
A Guinea 
 pig, right?

01:00.480 --> 01:02.000
Or a parrot.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.519
No. Spike's a little 
 more exotic than that.

01:04.519 --> 01:06.040
When I saw him 
 at the pet store,

01:06.040 --> 01:07.280
I fell in love with him.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.520
And he gave me 
 an idea for a story.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.960
There are thousands of 
 different animals on earth.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.040
Most we know.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.880
But a lot 
 are still a mystery.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.160
Yeah, like spike.

01:18.160 --> 01:18.920
No.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.040
I'm talking 
 about animals

01:21.040 --> 01:23.520
that live in 
 the deepest oceans,

01:23.520 --> 01:26.040
or in unexplored jungles.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.520
We don't know 
 much about them

01:27.520 --> 01:29.680
because they have 
 no contact with humans.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.040
And they live 
 by a set of rules

01:32.040 --> 01:33.360
we know nothing about.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.520
So imagine

01:37.520 --> 01:39.520
if one of these animals

01:39.520 --> 01:41.400
was brought into our world,

01:41.400 --> 01:43.520
would it adjust to us,

01:43.520 --> 01:46.800
or would it play 
 by its own rules,

01:46.800 --> 01:50.520
the rules of a game 
 we have no chance of winning?

01:51.960 --> 01:53.520
Submitted for the approval

01:53.520 --> 01:55.000
of the Midnight Society,

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I call this story...

02:34.560 --> 02:36.440
I love coming here. 
 They're so cute.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.920
It's sad, though.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.440
I want to 
 take them all home.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.920
Let's get one.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.160
No, thanks. 
 I'll stick with my fish.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.120
Hey.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.320
Don't bug the animals.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.880
What is that?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.160
Eeuw!

03:01.160 --> 03:02.480
I don't know.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.840
Its Latin name is 
 chameleo maloficus africanus.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.760
Maleco what?

03:08.760 --> 03:10.280
It's a chameleon.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.320
Ugly little thing.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.520
It's not ugly.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.520
That's what 
 makes it special.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.080
It changes colors 
 and stuff, right?

03:18.080 --> 03:19.080
And stuff.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.360
Wanna touch it?

03:20.360 --> 03:22.360
Don't! 
 It's probably got rabies.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.960
Reptiles 
 don't get rabies.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.640
It's so ugly, 
 it's cute.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.720
Ow!

03:33.720 --> 03:35.560
That little 
 snit bit me!

03:36.920 --> 03:38.880
Bites you once, 
 bites you twice,

03:38.880 --> 03:40.240
a little water, 
 pay the price.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.400
Are you OK?

03:49.400 --> 03:52.400
Yeah. 
 What a strange kid.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.400
He knew it was 
 gonna bite you.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.920
Little creep.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.800
You all set?

04:14.800 --> 04:16.600
I uh-- 
 bought the dye.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.279
How many times do we 
 have to go through this?

04:20.279 --> 04:23.000
I'm not letting you put 
 blue streaks in your hair.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.560
Why not? You've 
 dyed your hair.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.280
It's not the same thing,

04:27.280 --> 04:28.800
and you know it.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.280
Mom, would you please 
 stop treating me

04:32.280 --> 04:33.960
like 
 a little girl?

04:33.960 --> 04:36.360
I will, as soon as you 
 stop acting like one.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.000
Oh, hi, Sharon.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.480
Hi, Mr. Robinson.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.280
Thanks for having me 
 over this weekend.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.280
No sweat.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.320
Janice can't 
 live without you.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.800
Don't pick.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.000
We're eating soon.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.000
There's a big sale 
 at the flower depot tomorrow.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.080
I'm going to pick up some 
 delphiniums for out front.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.720
Perfect. Then we can pick 
 up my dress on the way home.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.440
You're not 
 getting that dress.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.440
Mom.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.560
What dress?

05:17.560 --> 05:20.720
I found the perfect dress 
 for the spring dance.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.480
It is a tight 
 little mini thing,

05:22.480 --> 05:25.320
and no daughter of mine 
 is going to be seen in it.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.240
I can do 
 what I want.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.240
Don't talk to me 
 like that, young lady.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.440
And no, you cannot 
 do what you want.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.200
Not yet, anyway.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.520
Huhh!

05:35.800 --> 05:37.240
How did that happen?

05:37.240 --> 05:38.720
Dad, talk to her, 
 please.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.240
I'm sorry, babe, 
 I've got to go along

05:40.240 --> 05:41.480
with your mom 
 on this one.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.800
I can't believe it.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.240
Now, can we have 
 a nice quiet,

05:51.240 --> 05:52.600
problem free weekend?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.080
No, we can't.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.720
It's never gonna 
 be problem free

05:55.720 --> 05:57.720
until you let me 
 grow up.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.800
Oh, come on.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.160
I'm gonna take 
 all my savings

06:15.160 --> 06:17.160
and buy 
 the dress myself.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.680
They're gonna 
 be ticked.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.080
They're not 
 gonna know.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.680
I'll sneak out wearing 
 something they'll approve of

06:21.680 --> 06:23.680
and I'll change 
 at school.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.320
Is it really worth 
 sneaking around like that?

06:26.320 --> 06:28.160
You don't know 
 what it's like.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.720
Your parents give you 
 all kinds of freedom.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.680
That's 'cause my parents 
 are never home.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.920
They're always working.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.640
Well, at least 
 they trust you.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.640
Mine still think 
 I need baby sitting.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.360
Ow!

06:44.200 --> 06:45.520
What happened?

06:45.520 --> 06:48.120
I'm sorry. 
 It's my finger.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.160
It's throbbing 
 because of that bite.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.280
That doesn't 
 sound too good.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.640
It's late, and you girls 
 should be in bed.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.400
Great. 
 Now we've got bed check.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.480
It's OK. 
 I'm tired anyway.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.120
Good night, Jen. 
 Good night.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.320
Good night, 
 Mrs. Robinson.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.240
Good night, sweetie.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.440
Ow!

07:55.760 --> 07:57.040
The chameleon?

08:02.560 --> 08:04.520
It's almost over.

08:04.520 --> 08:10.520
But then again, it's 
 really just beginning.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.760
What?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.160
Bite you once, 
 bite you twice,

08:20.160 --> 08:24.360
a little water, 
 pay the price!

08:26.960 --> 08:27.880
Aaahh!

08:27.880 --> 08:29.360
What's the matter?

08:29.360 --> 08:31.520
Who are 
 you talking to?

08:31.520 --> 08:33.360
Look.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.000
Look at what?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.159
It was the chameleon 
 from the store.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.640
It bit me again.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.640
Chameleon?

08:43.640 --> 08:44.880
How did it 
 get here?

08:44.880 --> 08:46.000
I don't know!

08:46.000 --> 08:48.360
Bite you once, 
 bite you twice,

08:48.360 --> 08:50.000
a little water, 
 pay the price.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.520
What are 
 you talking about?

08:51.520 --> 08:53.000
That's what 
 the kid said,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.800
and that's what 
 the chameleon said.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.920
The chameleon 
 talked?

08:59.920 --> 09:01.640
It turned into me.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.400
It looked just 
 like me. It was me.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.560
Sharon, I think the 
 chameleon wants to be me.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.400
Jan, nothing's here.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.040
I think you were 
 just dreaming.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.400
I wasn't.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.920
It was real.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.400
It bit me twice,

09:17.400 --> 09:19.400
and now it's coming 
 after me with water.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.920
Tell you what,

09:20.920 --> 09:23.120
how about if I sleep 
 in here tonight.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.600
I don't know what's 
 going on, Sharon.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.920
I'm sorry. I...

09:26.920 --> 09:28.400
Shh. It's OK.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.840
In the morning this will 
 all be a bad dream. OK?

09:57.320 --> 09:58.320
Aaahhh!

09:58.320 --> 09:59.920
What? What?!

10:02.480 --> 10:03.960
It wasn't a dream.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.840
I'm turning into 
 a chameleon. Look!

10:08.320 --> 10:10.000
Ugh, gross!

10:10.000 --> 10:12.920
But--it's just a rash.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.720
You're not turning 
 into a chameleon.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.280
Then why did it 
 come after me?

10:17.280 --> 10:19.400
Janice, get a grip!

10:19.400 --> 10:21.520
It was a dream.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.440
I'm getting dressed.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.280
Sharon?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.600
Do you really think 
 it was a dream?

10:28.600 --> 10:29.600
No!

10:29.600 --> 10:31.080
I think you're being

10:31.080 --> 10:33.440
stalked by 
 an evil chameleon

10:33.440 --> 10:36.760
that wants to 
 take over your life.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.440
Stay away 
 from the water.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.920
It's the last step.

10:39.920 --> 10:40.640
Boooo.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.560
I'll see you downstairs.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.880
Don't be an idiot.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.960
[Noise from shower]

11:08.920 --> 11:11.360
I'm going to 
 enjoy your life.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.280
Ooh, I'm learning 
 very fast!

11:13.280 --> 11:14.520
No!

11:22.520 --> 11:24.400
Ha ha ha ha ha!

11:29.080 --> 11:30.800
Ha ha ha ha!

11:40.280 --> 11:41.520
Come on, honey.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.200
We're holding 
 breakfast for you.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.880
OK, Mom.

11:58.440 --> 11:59.680
Sorry. 
 Couldn't wait.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.080
Did you show 
 your mom the rash?

12:02.080 --> 12:03.960
What rash?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.680
Oh, I thought 
 I had something,

12:05.680 --> 12:07.720
but it's gone now.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.840
Well, we'll keep 
 an eye on it.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.120
You know, Mom,

12:17.120 --> 12:18.880
I think you were right.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.680
About what?

12:20.680 --> 12:22.960
Well, dying my hair blue 
 is dumb.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.600
And I don't think I'm ready 
 to wear a dress like that.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.320
It's a little 
 too old for me.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.320
Great.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.520
Why the change 
 of heart?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.640
Well, I decided it wasn't 
 worth fighting over

12:32.640 --> 12:34.640
something so dumb.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.240
Are you 
 feeling OK?

12:36.240 --> 12:38.120
Sure. I'll call 
 the dress shop right now

12:38.120 --> 12:39.840
and have them 
 take it off hold.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.440
See? I told you 
 it was just a phase.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.720
You know, 
 you guys should get going.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.640
You know how crazy 
 it gets at the flower depot.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.200
We'll clean up.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.160
Hello. 
 Yes, no problem.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.640
I'd like to 
 place an order.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.320
Yes, I'll hold.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.720
We won't be long.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.200
See you in a bit.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.600
Wanna help me?

13:18.600 --> 13:19.720
Sure.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.560
What's going on?

13:26.560 --> 13:27.560
Nothing.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.080
Uh, I did 
 what you said.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.600
I got some sleep,

13:31.600 --> 13:33.080
and everything 
 before that seems

13:33.080 --> 13:34.600
like it was 
 a bad dream.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.720
But that's all 
 changed now.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.080
What are you doing?

13:43.080 --> 13:44.240
Uh...

13:44.240 --> 13:45.600
I saw a mouse.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.920
I hate mice.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.160
Oh! Um-- Dad has 
 a box of traps.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.560
I think we should 
 put them around the house.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.040
Jan?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.840
You think 
 we should do this?

14:10.240 --> 14:11.240
[Doorbell rings]

14:13.280 --> 14:14.280
I'll get it!

14:28.560 --> 14:30.000
Thank you.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.040
You're welcome.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.000
You bought the dress 
 after all, didn't you?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.560
No, I didn't.

14:40.040 --> 14:44.240
Oh, um-- don't forget to 
 put a trap in the kitchen.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.280
Well, then, what is it?

14:45.280 --> 14:46.360
Nothing!

15:13.280 --> 15:14.800
Hah.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.640
Sharon?

16:12.600 --> 16:15.000
Sharon, 
 you up there?

16:17.480 --> 16:18.800
Hi!

16:18.800 --> 16:20.640
Hi! That was quick.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.160
Are you kidding?

16:22.160 --> 16:23.320
We practically 
 bought out the whole store.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.080
And we bought 
 something for you, too.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.120
What is it?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.840
Well, it's 
 sort of an apology.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.840
We were both 
 wrong, and...

16:30.840 --> 16:32.920
I know it's not the 
 dress you wanted,

16:32.920 --> 16:35.680
but I hope 
 you like it anyway.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.600
Oh, it's beautiful!

16:38.600 --> 16:40.840
Oh, thank you, Mom.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.880
I like it better 
 than the other one.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.000
What were you doing?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.480
I uh...

16:49.840 --> 16:52.120
I-- went to 
 get my hairbrush.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.280
Why don't you go 
 try on the dress?

16:54.280 --> 16:56.480
We're going to make 
 some power drinks.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.240
Come on, ladies.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.839
Mrs. Robinson?

17:10.839 --> 17:13.839
Don't you think Janice has 
 been acting a little...

17:13.839 --> 17:15.319
Ta da!

17:15.319 --> 17:16.440
Wow!

17:18.040 --> 17:21.480
You look fantastic!

17:21.480 --> 17:23.680
It's perfect.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.400
What do you think, 
 Sharon?

17:28.119 --> 17:29.280
Is it me?

17:29.280 --> 17:32.120
Uh--yeah.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.760
Father: Hey, 
 let's get planting.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.720
I'm feeling 
 really creative.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.720
Mother: Oh, joy.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.760
Let's go.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.160
Are you feeling 
 OK, Sharon?

17:48.160 --> 17:49.680
You look a little...

17:49.680 --> 17:50.920
Pale.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.640
No. I'm fine.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.680
You've been acting 
 strange all day.

18:08.680 --> 18:09.440
Me?

18:10.360 --> 18:12.560
No, I'm fine.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.960
Having a good weekend?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Good juice, huh?

18:21.240 --> 18:24.960
Oh, there's something 
 I want to show you upstairs.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.640
What is it?

18:26.640 --> 18:28.280
It's a surprise.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.800
Come on, let's go.

18:29.800 --> 18:30.840
Ow!

18:39.000 --> 18:41.120
You're not Janice.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.400
Who are you?

18:42.400 --> 18:45.240
It's me. 
 I'm Janice.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.920
Don't you recognize me?

18:50.480 --> 18:51.760
You're the chameleon!

18:51.760 --> 18:54.040
There's nothing 
 you can do.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.440
There's thousands 
 of us out here,

18:56.440 --> 18:58.720
and more of us are 
 changing every day.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.760
Father: Janice!

18:59.760 --> 19:02.240
Go ahead and tell them.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.800
They'll think you're crazy.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.160
Hey, Janice,

19:08.160 --> 19:09.960
come here 
 for a second.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.200
Janice!

19:18.000 --> 19:20.040
You change 
 her back, now!

19:21.240 --> 19:24.000
Bite you once, 
 bite you twice,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.280
a little water, 
 pay the price.

19:26.280 --> 19:28.320
She won't 
 bite me again.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.200
Come on, Jan, 
 we need your opinion.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.840
I'll be right out, Dad.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.320
Now, please.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.000
Do we have 
 a dispute here?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.040
You too, Sharon.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.200
I'll be right out, 
 Mr. Robinson.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.480
I just have to 
 change my shirt.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.680
So, what do 
 you think?

20:00.680 --> 20:02.680
Well, I think 
 they're perfect.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.680
Wait a second. 
 Hold on.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.480
You haven't even 
 heard my idea yet.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.720
I really think the trim 
 needs to be a little thicker.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.680
It doesn't. 
 It'll fill in.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.200
I'll be right back.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.200
Stop!

20:35.880 --> 20:38.480
I won't let you 
 hurt my family.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.480
You're gonna 
 get caught!

20:40.480 --> 20:42.000
You think so?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.160
I think 
 people are so dumb,

20:43.160 --> 20:45.360
they won't find out 
 until it's too late.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.880
Don't fight it, Sharon.

20:46.880 --> 20:50.640
Just put your hand in 
 there and get it over with.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.720
Ouch!

20:51.720 --> 20:53.080
Bite you once, 
 bite you twice.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.240
You should 
 have counted.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.760
Your family 
 had a guest.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.640
Quick, grab the hose!

21:04.640 --> 21:06.600
Now, add water!

21:06.600 --> 21:07.360
No!

21:16.480 --> 21:18.600
It's me, Sharon.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.760
No, it's me!

21:19.760 --> 21:21.360
I'm your 
 best friend!

21:21.360 --> 21:24.280
I'm the one who knows your 
 parents, Bob and Carol.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.480
That's right, 
 and they're in Hawaii.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.800
Janice?!

21:29.240 --> 21:30.880
I don't know 
 which one is you!

21:30.880 --> 21:32.400
Don't spray me!

21:32.400 --> 21:33.600
I might turn back 
 into the chameleon!

21:33.600 --> 21:36.480
Wait. I can prove that 
 I'm the real Janice.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.920
Only the real Janice 
 would do this.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.600
No! It's a trick!

21:44.280 --> 21:45.680
It's really me, 
 Sharon.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.920
A little water, 
 pay the price.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.680
Aaahhhh!

22:02.760 --> 22:04.000
Kill it!

22:16.840 --> 22:18.520
It's really you, 
 isn't it?

22:18.520 --> 22:20.040
Yes. 
 And can you please

22:20.040 --> 22:21.960
get me out of 
 this creepy dress?

22:21.960 --> 22:23.720
Welcome back, Jan.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.840
Oh, I'm sorry 
 I had to do that,

22:44.840 --> 22:48.360
but I knew you'd 
 find the bucket.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.960
Oh, I see we left our 
 little friend down there.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.200
I hope she knows 
 how to swim.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.320
The end.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.440
That was great. 
 Cool.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.840
So, are we gonna 
 see Spike?

23:08.840 --> 23:10.040
He's a chameleon, 
 right?

23:10.040 --> 23:11.360
Come over and see.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.520
Oh, how cute.

23:14.520 --> 23:15.920
He's sleeping.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.480
Aren't you afraid 
 it's gonna bite?

23:18.480 --> 23:20.600
Naw, 
 chameleons don't bite.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.960
Gotta go!

23:31.960 --> 23:34.080
Just wait until they see 
 you when you grow up.
