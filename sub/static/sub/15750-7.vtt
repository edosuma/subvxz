00:31.175 --> 00:34.055
Now the reporting restrictions are
getting worse.

00:34.055 --> 00:36.495
I want to tell my readers the truth.

00:36.495 --> 00:39.975
The stories I'm allowed to print are
only fit for the gossip columns.

00:41.215 --> 00:44.735
The editor's always pushing me for a
scoop. Whiskers!

00:44.735 --> 00:47.775
What has whiskers got to do with it?
Every time you get het up

00:47.775 --> 00:51.295
about some great injustice or other,
I see your whiskers bristle.

00:51.295 --> 00:54.495
Is that an attractive quality?

00:54.495 --> 00:57.815
Well, I'm on your arm, aren't I?
That you are, Kitty Hawkins.

00:57.815 --> 00:59.775
That you are.

01:00.615 --> 01:03.215
What's going on, Frank?

01:12.215 --> 01:14.615
So is he a spy?
Well, who knows?

01:17.375 --> 01:20.095
Would you like to call everyone to
order, Mr. Crabb?

01:20.895 --> 01:24.335
Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't
mind. A-hem.

01:24.335 --> 01:26.775
Right.

01:26.775 --> 01:29.735
Spying is treason and the punishment
for treason is hanging.

01:29.735 --> 01:33.335
Yes. But who on earth would suspect
Mr. Leclair of such a thing?

01:33.335 --> 01:37.295
This is war, Miss Mardle. People
show their true colors.

01:38.455 --> 01:40.575
Let's not rush to judgment, eh?

01:40.575 --> 01:42.815
Especially when none of us know the
facts.

01:42.815 --> 01:45.735
Yes, I agree with Mr. Colleano.
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:45.735 --> 01:48.975
If you please.

01:52.055 --> 01:53.935
Thank you, Mr. Colleano.

01:53.935 --> 01:57.575
Now, I appreciate we're all shocked
and distressed

01:57.575 --> 02:01.175
by the incident involving Monsieur
Leclair.

02:01.175 --> 02:05.415
One can hardly fail to notice the
presence of the police in the store.

02:05.415 --> 02:10.255
As I'm sure you're aware,
it's somewhat unfortunate timing.

02:10.255 --> 02:14.255
Mr. Selfridge was been called away to
Paris on store business.

02:14.255 --> 02:18.335
In his absence, Mr. Crabb and I will
take the helm.

02:18.335 --> 02:22.255
When do we expect Mr. Selfridge
to return? Imminently.

02:22.255 --> 02:25.015
Imminently. Wouldn't you say, Mr.
Crabb?

02:25.015 --> 02:28.335
That... That was the impression Mrs.
Selfridge gave me.

02:28.335 --> 02:31.015
Merely a short trip to meet some new
wholesalers.

02:32.215 --> 02:35.095
In the meantime, I would ask you to
do your best

02:35.095 --> 02:39.535
to co-operate with the authorities
and to answer any questions.

02:40.615 --> 02:43.295
Anything...? No, that will be all.
Thank you.

02:47.695 --> 02:49.655
Back to business, Mr. Crabb.

02:55.855 --> 03:00.815
Paris at a moment's notice. And yet,
Mr. Selfridge left no itinerary.

03:00.815 --> 03:05.695
This is most unlike him. He usually
asks me to book his accommodation.

03:05.695 --> 03:08.375
I can only assume he chose to make
his own arrangements.

03:08.375 --> 03:11.255
If you wish, I could try his
favorite hotels.

03:12.495 --> 03:15.735
Do so at once, Miss Plunkett. Let me
know the second you hear from him.

03:15.735 --> 03:17.655
Yes, Mr. Crabb.

03:20.415 --> 03:24.215
You said yourself Mr. Leclair has
been acting strangely.

03:24.215 --> 03:26.855
Something's wrong. But spying...

03:26.855 --> 03:28.815
Stranger things have happened.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.895
Go to the police station. Talk
to him.

03:36.895 --> 03:38.975
Find out what all this is about.

03:38.975 --> 03:41.415
If anyone says anything here,
I'll cover for you.

03:47.055 --> 03:49.215
Thank you.

04:00.335 --> 04:02.935
They can't do this. If Pa was here,
he would -

04:02.935 --> 04:04.975
He would co-operate, as are we.

04:04.975 --> 04:07.055
He only be in France a short while.

04:07.055 --> 04:09.495
I hate the fact they're searching our
home.

04:09.495 --> 04:11.695
There must be some kind of
misunderstanding.

04:11.695 --> 04:15.135
Then why aren't we doing anything?
Henri is no spy.

04:15.135 --> 04:17.935
Your father's lawyers are trying to
ascertain what evidence

04:17.935 --> 04:19.815
the police have against him.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.535
Miss Towler.

04:34.815 --> 04:37.015
For God's sake, Henri. Call me by my
name.

04:44.615 --> 04:46.615
It's good to see you, Agnes.

04:46.615 --> 04:48.655
Look at you.

04:49.775 --> 04:51.975
They will not even let me change my
shirt.

04:52.815 --> 04:54.775
I look terrible. I'm sorry.

04:55.895 --> 04:58.855
What is it that they think you've
done?

05:00.175 --> 05:02.735
They believe I have a link to
Germany.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.615
And do you?

05:04.615 --> 05:06.575
It's not what they think.

05:08.655 --> 05:11.615
What? And you explained that? That
you were innocent?

05:11.615 --> 05:14.855
You don't think I've tried? They
refuse to believe me.

05:14.855 --> 05:17.175
Well, then, tell me.

05:17.175 --> 05:19.855
Tell me and I will do everything I
can to help you.

05:19.855 --> 05:22.615
You have to trust me.

05:22.615 --> 05:25.815
You're in great danger.

05:25.815 --> 05:29.655
If they charge you with treason, God
only knows what could happen.

05:30.735 --> 05:33.295
But, please, all I want is the
truth.

05:38.135 --> 05:40.095
I'm no spy.

05:41.975 --> 05:46.015
Ever since I returned to London,
I've been searching for someone.

05:47.855 --> 05:49.815
I've been looking for Valerie.

05:51.735 --> 05:54.255
Valerie Maurel?
Valerie Maurel.

05:55.415 --> 05:57.415
She left me a year ago.

06:01.255 --> 06:03.255
We had been happy in New York.

06:04.135 --> 06:06.175
Or so I thought.

06:06.175 --> 06:08.135
But then she met another man.

06:10.855 --> 06:12.815
They left and went to Berlin.

06:13.615 --> 06:15.935
I followed them. I don't understand.

06:15.935 --> 06:18.375
Why couldn't you accept them being
together?

06:21.855 --> 06:23.855
I did, finally, but...

06:26.895 --> 06:29.095
But you loved her very much,
didn't you?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.255
I heard they had come back to
England

06:37.255 --> 06:39.535
so I came back, hired a detective.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.735
I just needed to talk to her.

06:44.775 --> 06:47.615
Well, if you've explained all of
this to the police

06:47.615 --> 06:49.655
then why won't they release you?

06:49.655 --> 06:52.335
Someone in the store has accused me
of being a spy.

06:53.935 --> 06:57.655
They think I'm lying about Valerie
to conceal the truth.

06:57.655 --> 07:00.175
Who would do such a thing? Why?

07:00.175 --> 07:04.255
That's it. Time's up.
We haven't finished. Yes, you have.

07:14.055 --> 07:18.175
White gold and diamonds. Mr. Colleano
shows taste.

07:18.175 --> 07:21.135
Victor proposed last night. I said
yes.

07:23.775 --> 07:25.775
Then you must both be very happy.

07:25.855 --> 07:28.095
You've never approved before.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.815
He's a good man. You deserve nothing
less.

07:50.655 --> 07:52.575
- Miss Mardle.
- Mr. Grove.

07:58.335 --> 08:02.575
Miss Mardle, I feel I simply must
broach a somewhat delicate subject.

08:02.575 --> 08:04.535
Mr. Grove?

08:04.535 --> 08:08.095
Your lodger. Florin?

08:08.095 --> 08:10.575
He's a young man.

08:10.575 --> 08:13.375
And men, we both know, have
certain...

08:13.375 --> 08:14.855
urges.

08:14.855 --> 08:17.655
Urges they might find hard to
control.

08:20.135 --> 08:23.135
I'm sorry. I'm not quite sure what
you're referring to.

08:25.095 --> 08:27.495
I'm merely concerned for your
reputation.

08:27.495 --> 08:29.455
My reputation?

08:31.495 --> 08:33.975
He gives you a certain look...

08:33.975 --> 08:37.255
which only a man of similar weakness
might recognize.

08:40.255 --> 08:43.495
That is the most ridiculous thing
I have ever heard.

08:43.495 --> 08:46.575
There is NOTHING inappropriate about
out arrangement.

08:46.575 --> 08:49.215
I don't know what to say.

08:51.135 --> 08:53.135
I'm sorry.

08:57.175 --> 08:59.135
Miss Towler.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.255
Sit down.

09:09.255 --> 09:11.375
Mr. Leclair can explain everything.

09:11.375 --> 09:14.735
He's been looking for Valerie Maurel
which is why he went to Germany.

09:14.735 --> 09:18.215
He even hired a detective. Which
accounts for his strange behavior.

09:18.215 --> 09:20.615
Yet they're refusing to release him.

09:20.615 --> 09:22.815
Someone has accused him
of being a spy.

09:22.815 --> 09:25.895
Someone from Selfridge's. It's
why the police won't believe him.

09:25.895 --> 09:30.495
But we have no idea who is accuser
is? The police won't say.

09:30.495 --> 09:33.095
But Mr. Thackeray has never liked
Henri

09:33.095 --> 09:36.415
especially since Mr. Selfridge
promoted him. I agree.

09:36.415 --> 09:40.455
There has been a certain rivalry.
Two creative people. He hates him!

09:40.455 --> 09:43.535
We mustn't jump to conclusions.

09:43.535 --> 09:47.015
Leave it to me. You will find out
who did this.

09:47.015 --> 09:49.495
You know his life is at stake?

09:52.815 --> 09:55.655
Be assured, this matter will be dealt
with.

09:55.655 --> 10:00.415
If someone has falsely accused Henri
Leclair, I will find out who that is.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.025
I don't understand Mrs. Blunkett

10:10.913 --> 10:14.293
Harry always stays at The Ritz when
he's in Paris.

10:14.304 --> 10:16.384
I'll keep trying other hotels.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.860
All right. You will call me if he
does arrive?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.200
Of course, Mrs. Selfridge.
Thank you.

10:22.118 --> 10:24.158
Goodbye.

10:59.353 --> 11:01.433
Why would he have this?

11:01.433 --> 11:03.753
It's Bill's handwriting.

11:05.652 --> 11:07.692
Who's Bill?

11:07.951 --> 11:09.991
Bill Summertime.

11:11.199 --> 11:13.519
He works for the Intelligence
Service.

11:13.519 --> 11:15.919
The INTELLIGENCE service?

11:15.919 --> 11:18.039
Yes, they were in touch with Harry.

11:19.399 --> 11:22.719
I'm sorry. I just assumed
that he would have confided in you.

11:26.439 --> 11:28.399
Where's Harry?

11:29.879 --> 11:32.199
Where's my husband?
I don't know.

11:32.199 --> 11:34.719
From the looks of this,
he's in Germany.

11:34.719 --> 11:38.999
Germany? I'm sure if they thought
there was any real danger...

11:38.999 --> 11:41.039
My husband runs a London store.

11:41.039 --> 11:43.639
He's been sent into the arms of the
enemy and you think

11:43.639 --> 11:46.119
there's no real danger.
Rose, I apologise.

11:46.119 --> 11:49.199
I honestly thought that he would
have discussed this with you.

11:49.199 --> 11:51.279
I had no idea that your relationship
was in -

11:51.279 --> 11:53.519
This is nothing to do with my
relationship.

11:58.599 --> 12:01.879
I need to contact my husband. There
has been an emergency here.

12:01.879 --> 12:04.599
Henri Leclair has been arrested for
spying. Henri?

12:04.599 --> 12:07.799
You know this man Summertime.
You need to find out where Harry is.

12:09.559 --> 12:12.039
I want my husband back.

12:17.719 --> 12:21.159
We still have no firm idea as
to when Mr. Selfridge will return.

12:21.159 --> 12:23.759
Has he contacted you at all?

12:23.759 --> 12:28.439
Not precisely. But with all the war
restrictions, he may be unable to.

12:28.439 --> 12:31.399
Hm. Just so. Though, if I may say
so, it is most unlike him.

12:31.399 --> 12:33.759
He does so pride himself in keeping
in touch. Yes.

12:33.759 --> 12:36.959
Rest assured. The minute I hear from
him, you will be the first to know.

12:36.959 --> 12:38.399
Thank you.

12:38.399 --> 12:41.199
It's the timing. Somewhat
unfortunate.

12:41.199 --> 12:44.159
People are seeing conspiracies
everywhere they look.

12:44.159 --> 12:46.519
All the more reason for us to keep
our heads.

13:05.999 --> 13:08.079
Lord Egerton.

13:08.079 --> 13:12.239
I've had the Ministry on the phone
all morning bending my bloody ear!

13:12.239 --> 13:15.279
Apologies for the language,
Lady Loxley. Shoddy.

13:15.279 --> 13:18.159
Poor workmanship. And the worst of
it is,

13:18.159 --> 13:20.999
the story is leaking faster than
your damn boots!

13:20.999 --> 13:23.959
So it's a bad batch. Teething
troubles.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.519
I'll have a word with the suppliers.
For God's sake!

13:26.519 --> 13:28.599
Everything they've sent us failed.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.159
Poor seams. Cheap leather.

13:32.279 --> 13:35.559
I merely acted on the
recommendations of Harry Selfridge.

13:35.559 --> 13:38.119
And you followed his advice?
To the LETTER.

13:38.119 --> 13:43.319
Whoever is to blame, you're the one
who is gonna carry the can for this

13:43.319 --> 13:46.999
if it gets out so I suggest you take
steps to fix it.

13:48.279 --> 13:50.239
NOW.

14:03.639 --> 14:05.719
This is a new low.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.279
Even for you, Loxley.

14:08.279 --> 14:12.359
Young men sent to the front
with boots like these.

14:13.399 --> 14:15.799
You should be ashamed of yourself.

14:15.799 --> 14:19.159
One can't be held to account for
another man's mistakes.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.639
I'm no fool.

14:23.999 --> 14:27.919
One minute we're broke and the next
we're rolling in it.

14:29.039 --> 14:32.439
There's no wonder you were in such
a hurry to get back to town

14:32.439 --> 14:34.239
the moment war was declared.

14:34.239 --> 14:37.319
And you never showed a blind bit of
interest in the House of Lords

14:37.319 --> 14:40.679
until you realised you could get on
the Procurement Committee.

14:40.679 --> 14:44.719
Then you take a kickback from your
shady manufacturers.

14:44.719 --> 14:47.719
Making a profit from WAR.

14:49.879 --> 14:54.079
Oh, and now... You have the nerve to
try and blame the whole thing

14:54.079 --> 14:56.719
on Harry Selfridge.

14:56.719 --> 15:00.239
It is a pity you didn't raise these
concerns to your shopkeeper friend

15:00.239 --> 15:03.519
before you vouched for me.

15:03.519 --> 15:09.759
Before you went on your
little spending spree in his store.

15:09.759 --> 15:12.279
No, don't you dare! DON'T YOU DARE!

15:12.279 --> 15:15.159
This has NOTHING to do with me!
On the contrary.

15:15.159 --> 15:19.039
You've been lavishing my money
all over town and the world knows it.

15:19.039 --> 15:22.079
And as you are aware, appearances
are everything.

15:24.879 --> 15:27.319
I may be landed gentry and you might
be some...

15:27.839 --> 15:32.039
..tart from the stage but we do have
one thing in common, Mae.

15:32.879 --> 15:35.799
We BOTH look after NO.1.

15:36.399 --> 15:38.919
At least I have the honesty
to admit it.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.439
Come in.
Mr. Crabb...

15:57.519 --> 15:59.439
..I think you should see this.

16:18.799 --> 16:20.719
Thank you, Miss Plunkett.

16:45.279 --> 16:47.239
Mr. Crabb?

16:51.959 --> 16:53.999
This letter from Mr. Fletcher's
family

16:53.999 --> 16:55.959
arrived with the morning post.

17:11.719 --> 17:13.638
Dave's been killed.

17:18.719 --> 17:20.679
One hardly knows how to react.

17:25.159 --> 17:28.039
Ed and George? The other lads from
the loading bay?

17:28.039 --> 17:31.839
No word, I'm afraid. One must assume
they remain safe.

17:35.359 --> 17:37.359
Have you told anyone else?

17:37.359 --> 17:40.439
Mr. Grove is aware. No-one else.

17:40.439 --> 17:43.879
In normal circumstances,
Mr. Selfridge would write a letter

17:43.879 --> 17:46.439
of condolence to the family himself.

17:46.439 --> 17:48.559
But in his absence...
I'll do it.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.399
Dave was my friend.

17:56.839 --> 18:00.039
We have no idea when father will be
back and this can't wait.

18:01.359 --> 18:04.319
I'll write it.
If you're sure.

18:04.319 --> 18:06.279
It's what Father would want.

18:10.279 --> 18:13.279
You'll have it today.
Very good, sir.

18:19.879 --> 18:21.919
It has to be. Listen.

18:21.919 --> 18:24.319
Walked in the park with K
this morning.

18:24.319 --> 18:26.799
Sometimes it takes the words of a
beautiful woman

18:26.799 --> 18:29.319
to make one realize what truly
matters in life.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.439
Sorry, Miss Hawkins.

18:32.439 --> 18:35.479
We were just reading Mr. Edwards'
column. Is it true?

18:35.479 --> 18:37.439
Is it you? Miss K?

18:39.399 --> 18:42.679
I'm sure I've got no idea
what you're talking about. Look.

18:42.679 --> 18:44.679
Right here.

18:53.119 --> 18:55.079
Back to work, please, girls.

18:57.559 --> 18:59.639
Timeless, wouldn't you say, Mr.
Grove?

19:01.159 --> 19:04.599
The finest fabrics France has
to offer. A most impressive display.

19:04.599 --> 19:08.999
I'm sure Monsieur Leclair would
appreciate it. Yes, indeed.

19:09.919 --> 19:12.799
His arrest is most disturbing.

19:12.799 --> 19:16.159
I recall you had your concerns over
his probity.

19:16.719 --> 19:20.479
Information I thought you should be
made aware of as Chief of Staff.

19:20.479 --> 19:25.359
The situation is serious. Penalties
for espionage are most severe.

19:25.359 --> 19:28.639
If someone were to suffer as
a result of a wrongful conviction,

19:28.639 --> 19:30.759
that would be a tragedy indeed.

19:30.759 --> 19:36.359
I have utter faith in the
authorities. Justice will be served.

19:36.359 --> 19:38.359
Well, I hope so. For all our sakes.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.119
Writing love letters to your
sweetheart?

19:58.119 --> 20:00.519
Sorry. You were a million miles away
then.

20:00.519 --> 20:02.519
What's wrong?

20:03.839 --> 20:05.799
Mr. Crabb came to see me.

20:07.119 --> 20:09.239
He received a letter.

20:09.239 --> 20:12.079
It's Dave.
Why is Dave writing to Mr. Crabb?

20:12.079 --> 20:14.079
It's not that.

20:15.879 --> 20:17.959
Dave was killed, Grace.

20:17.959 --> 20:20.399
At the Front.

20:25.079 --> 20:27.239
Hey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:29.439 --> 20:31.359
I knew you were close.

20:33.079 --> 20:35.679
When we had problems with the
union...

20:36.879 --> 20:39.159
..he proved himself to be a real
friend.

20:39.159 --> 20:42.719
He understood that family was more
important.

20:42.719 --> 20:45.999
That I had to stick up for my
father.

20:47.359 --> 20:49.399
So, what are you writing?

20:49.399 --> 20:51.919
It's a letter of condolence to his
family.

20:55.039 --> 20:58.319
Mr. Selfridge isn't here
so it's become my responsibility.

20:59.719 --> 21:02.679
You should hear Mr. Edwards talk.

21:02.679 --> 21:06.319
The tales he tells me.
Really, Miss Hawkins? Oh, yes!

21:06.319 --> 21:08.279
Spies in our midst.

21:09.319 --> 21:11.399
Secret agents everywhere.

21:11.399 --> 21:12.999
Even Buckingham Palace has got...

21:14.839 --> 21:17.759
Oh, don't stop on my account.

21:17.759 --> 21:20.359
Miss Towler, I'm sure
Miss Hawkins meant no harm.

21:20.359 --> 21:23.239
Of course she did. She always DOES.

21:23.919 --> 21:25.879
You're pathetic!

21:25.879 --> 21:29.079
I wouldn't be surprised if it
weren't you that informed on him.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.759
Don't you see the damage this does?

21:30.759 --> 21:33.239
Miss Towler, this is neither the
time nor the place.

21:33.239 --> 21:35.199
Leclair helped make this store what
it is.

21:35.199 --> 21:38.679
Your jobs, your lives, you have him
to thank. You don't deserve him.

21:38.679 --> 21:41.799
Any of you.
On with your work.

21:41.799 --> 21:43.879
So why doesn't he explain himself?

21:43.879 --> 21:47.439
He tried but the police won't believe
him.

21:47.439 --> 21:49.599
And now... now somebody's accused
him.

21:49.919 --> 21:52.999
They won't let him go till they've
investigated him.

21:56.399 --> 21:59.239
Being in love with a girl is no
crime in my book.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.719
Oh, we need... We need to do
something.

22:03.719 --> 22:08.359
I'm sure Mr. Thackeray's accused him
but we need to prove it.

22:09.479 --> 22:12.719
Now, I know Mr. Grove is doing his
best but...

22:12.719 --> 22:15.239
But there's no reason we can't give
him a helping hand.

22:19.919 --> 22:23.439
- I used the supplier
that Selfridge himself recommended...

22:23.439 --> 22:25.519
for military boots.

22:25.519 --> 22:27.519
So there's your story, Mr. Edwards.

22:29.559 --> 22:31.559
I thought you might be interested.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.639
Yes, I would be willing to meet you.

22:38.199 --> 22:40.279
Well, why don't you come to the
house?

22:52.384 --> 22:54.464
Don't you?

22:57.447 --> 23:00.167
An inferior job by an inferior firm.

23:00.605 --> 23:03.565
All on Selfridge's recommendations.

23:02.833 --> 23:06.913
The reputation of my Procurement
Committee is at stake here.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.220
Not to mention the effect on morale.

23:09.650 --> 23:11.690
Questions need to be asked.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.290
I thought you were the man to do it.

23:14.290 --> 23:17.530
I know Harry Selfridge. I can't
believe he'd allow this to happen.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.050
I agree. It seems strange.

23:21.450 --> 23:24.490
I have tried to contact him to get
his side of the story,

23:24.490 --> 23:28.010
but he's unavailable and the men are
talking.

23:28.010 --> 23:29.890
This story is about to break.

23:32.570 --> 23:36.050
You understand I can't publish this
without corroboration.

23:36.050 --> 23:39.410
Even that would be a risk. The man
has more lawyers than lovers.

23:40.490 --> 23:42.530
I need to speak to him myself.

23:42.530 --> 23:46.450
I understand completely. You must do
what you think is right.

23:46.450 --> 23:52.210
But one way or another, Mr. Edwards,
this story will come out.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.930
I say it's just another word for
coward.

24:00.930 --> 24:03.210
I don't see what business it is of
yours, Victor!

24:03.210 --> 24:07.410
Last time I looked, you were still
family so I can still tell
you what's what.

24:18.930 --> 24:21.530
Family quarrel, Mr. Colleano?

24:21.530 --> 24:23.130
You saw?

24:23.130 --> 24:27.970
My apologies. The boy's an idiot.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.050
Decided to call himself a pacifist.

24:31.050 --> 24:34.410
Forgets where his loyalties
should lie.

24:34.410 --> 24:36.770
Don't be fooled by the name,
Mr. Thackeray.

24:36.770 --> 24:39.090
I'm as English as the next man.

24:39.090 --> 24:42.090
An admirable attitude.
We all have to be on our guard.

24:42.090 --> 24:43.810
Can't trust anyone.

24:43.810 --> 24:47.170
Personally, I'm glad someone shopped
that frog Leclair.

24:47.170 --> 24:51.410
Well, Miss Towler seems to worship
him.

24:51.410 --> 24:53.370
Though Lord knows quite why.

24:56.210 --> 24:59.290
I'm glad we see eye-to-eye,
Mr. Thackeray.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.810
I was beginning to think the world
had gone mad.

25:03.090 --> 25:05.930
Whoever turned Leclair in has done
us all a favor.

25:05.930 --> 25:08.010
I'd like to shake him by the hand.

25:08.010 --> 25:10.530
Then why don't you?

25:21.210 --> 25:23.290
I merely did what I thought was
right.

25:24.210 --> 25:26.210
For my country and my store.

25:44.250 --> 25:46.570
I was surprised to read your column
today.

25:46.570 --> 25:49.290
I think at least you could have
consulted me

25:49.290 --> 25:52.410
before using my good name for
popular entertainment.

25:52.410 --> 25:54.850
I've been trying to see Mr. Selfridge.

25:54.850 --> 25:57.490
It's not like him to disappear
without warning.

25:57.490 --> 26:00.770
Miss Plunkett seemed most perturbed
when I asked her.

26:00.770 --> 26:04.730
He was supposed to be in Paris but
nobody's been able to contact him.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.410
They've tried the hotels?
Everywhere.

26:07.410 --> 26:10.170
It's like he's vanished into thin
air.

26:17.290 --> 26:21.330
Considering working for our rivals?
They're killing us.

26:22.490 --> 26:25.930
We need a story Frank and a little
bird tells me

26:25.930 --> 26:29.810
you've got something on our
Mr. Selfridge. Sketchy. Rumors.

26:29.810 --> 26:32.290
That he cut corners on military
supplies?

26:32.290 --> 26:34.690
Seems out of character for
Selfridge.

26:34.690 --> 26:38.010
We can't run it till we talk to him
and he's not in the country.

26:38.010 --> 26:40.730
I need a scoop, Frank. So do you.

26:40.730 --> 26:45.450
I've got another lead. Lady Diana
Manners. Tittle tattle.

26:45.450 --> 26:47.930
My readers want real news.

26:47.930 --> 26:51.650
Harry Selfridge. We can't run it
till he's had right of reply

26:51.650 --> 26:54.890
and I don't know where he is.
I do.

26:54.890 --> 26:57.370
He boarded a train last night.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.410
But not bound for Paris.

27:02.010 --> 27:05.130
Right now, Mr. Selfridge is on a
train through Holland.

27:05.130 --> 27:10.170
All very incognito but we've got a
source in the porter's lodge.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.770
So where's he going?
Germany.

27:13.770 --> 27:15.570
Berlin.

27:18.210 --> 27:20.370
Are you quite sure?

27:20.370 --> 27:22.170
It goes in the evening edition.

27:24.290 --> 27:27.090
Write it, Frank. Or I'll find
someone else who WILL.

27:35.810 --> 27:38.610
It's no good.
Maybe we should stop. Give up.

27:39.770 --> 27:41.770
Wait until Mr. Selfridge gets back.

27:42.770 --> 27:45.890
You're right. My father would know
the right thing to say.

27:47.810 --> 27:50.650
Well, maybe Mr. Selfridge is part of
the problem.

27:51.730 --> 27:55.050
You're trying to be like him
when you should just be yourself.

27:55.050 --> 27:57.170
So what would this Mr. Selfridge do?

27:59.210 --> 28:01.810
He'd wish he hadn't offered to write
this letter.

28:03.170 --> 28:05.210
Then don't.

28:12.370 --> 28:14.410
Do you trust me, Kitty?

28:14.410 --> 28:16.690
How do you mean?
I'm serious.

28:21.290 --> 28:23.610
Well, as much as any so-called
gentleman.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.890
And do you believe one should try
and tell the truth

28:27.890 --> 28:29.810
when something really mattered?

28:33.850 --> 28:35.810
Is something wrong, Frank?

28:37.930 --> 28:39.890
I rather fear it is.

28:43.810 --> 28:45.850
Thank you, Mr. Colleano.

28:50.530 --> 28:52.530
You wanted to see me?

28:54.170 --> 28:57.650
Mr. Colleano has told me what you said
about Monsieur Leclair.

29:00.850 --> 29:03.010
I see.
You don't deny it?

29:04.490 --> 29:07.210
Monsieur Leclair was acting
suspiciously.

29:07.210 --> 29:10.130
He'd admitted he spent time
in Germany.

29:10.130 --> 29:13.250
I came to Mr. Grove with my concerns
and he chose to ignore them.

29:13.250 --> 29:16.530
What else could I do? He's explained
his actions. You believed him?

29:16.530 --> 29:18.370
I have no reason to doubt him.

29:18.370 --> 29:20.650
He traveled to Berlin on a personal
matter.

29:20.650 --> 29:24.370
The pursuit of which then brought him
to London. Nevertheless...

29:24.370 --> 29:27.610
He has risked the reputation of this
store. The store my husband owns.

29:27.610 --> 29:30.810
He founded it on certain principles
- respect for the customer,

29:30.810 --> 29:33.450
respect for the employees whether
they are head of fashion

29:33.450 --> 29:36.730
or sweeping the corridors.
Perhaps I was too quick to act.

29:36.730 --> 29:40.210
Whatever your motivation, what you
did was wrong.

29:40.210 --> 29:43.210
Are you handing me my notice?

29:43.210 --> 29:45.610
If it was up to me, then yes.

29:45.610 --> 29:48.410
But the final decision rests with
Mrs. Selfridge.

29:48.410 --> 29:52.130
However, I do insist that you
accompany me to the police station

29:52.130 --> 29:55.290
where you will make
a full retraction of your statement.

29:55.290 --> 29:56.650
Collect your things.

30:00.290 --> 30:02.250
Mr. Crabb.
The newspaper.

30:02.250 --> 30:03.890
Dreadful news.

30:03.890 --> 30:06.090
It's all over the front page.

30:06.090 --> 30:08.090
One can hardly believe it.

30:08.090 --> 30:11.090
It's scandalous! Utterly scandalous!

30:11.090 --> 30:14.210
- Procurement
scandal! Read all about it!

30:20.530 --> 30:24.050
Procurement scandal! Selfridge
implicated! Read all about it!

30:30.970 --> 30:33.010
Read all about it!

30:33.610 --> 30:36.610
Procurement scandal! Selfridge
implicated! Read all about it!

30:36.610 --> 30:40.410
Tissue of lies. The very idea that
Mr. Selfridge would recommend

30:40.410 --> 30:44.650
any of these manufacturers. We know
full well these names are dubious.

30:44.650 --> 30:48.370
High profile sources have
confirmed to this journalist

30:48.370 --> 30:50.330
there are more questions to be
answered.

30:50.330 --> 30:53.530
Lord Loxley of the Military
Procurement Committee

30:53.530 --> 30:56.730
has expressed his shock and surprise
at the turn of events.

30:56.730 --> 31:00.890
Loxley said that? Mr. Selfridge is
not available for comment.

31:01.970 --> 31:05.370
There are rumors he is currently
traveling through Germany.

31:05.370 --> 31:09.130
But this is all nonsense! Germany?
Mr. Selfridge is in Paris.

31:09.130 --> 31:13.450
We must issue a denial. Demand an
immediate retraction. I agree.

31:13.450 --> 31:15.370
NO!

31:15.370 --> 31:19.690
We do nothing till Mr. Selfridge
returns and we hear what
he has to say.

31:19.690 --> 31:23.770
Surely you don't believe there can
be any basis to these allegations?

31:23.770 --> 31:27.610
Of course not. A strident denial
could simply fuel the fire.

31:27.610 --> 31:29.450
Are you quite all right, Mrs.
Selfridge?

31:29.450 --> 31:31.690
Shall I open a window?

31:31.690 --> 31:35.490
Glass of water? I could ask Mrs.
Plunkett... No, I'm fine.

31:35.490 --> 31:38.490
Thank you... Mr. Crabb.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.410
I think that under the
circumstances,

31:40.410 --> 31:43.170
a dignified silence is the wisest
course.

31:43.170 --> 31:45.290
At least until my husband returns.

31:45.290 --> 31:48.330
And then, he can explain his actions
himself.

32:03.817 --> 32:04.817
Where are we going?

32:04.966 --> 32:05.966
All in good time.

32:12.796 --> 32:15.156
So why won't you tell me where we're
going?

32:14.862 --> 32:16.782
Cos we're already here.

32:18.782 --> 32:21.142
This is where Dave's family live.

32:25.129 --> 32:28.489
I don't know if I can do it.
Just tell them what you told me.

32:28.489 --> 32:30.769
From the heart.

32:30.769 --> 32:33.569
That's all that really matters...
Mr. Selfridge.

32:45.329 --> 32:47.729
Mrs. Fletcher...

32:47.729 --> 32:49.689
I'm Gordon Selfridge. May I come in?

32:50.729 --> 32:53.049
Of course.

33:08.609 --> 33:11.249
That was truly lovely.

33:11.249 --> 33:16.329
Music is beautiful. All I have to do
is play.

33:19.169 --> 33:22.849
Florin, there is something that has
been brought to my attention.

33:22.849 --> 33:25.409
A suggestion that I am sure is quite
ridiculous

33:25.409 --> 33:30.049
but now it has been made, I feel we
need to clear the air, as it were.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.369
Yes?

33:33.289 --> 33:35.329
I'm afraid it is rather personal.

33:35.329 --> 33:38.729
If you wish me to pay rent...?
Rent? Rent?

33:38.729 --> 33:41.569
Oh, goodness me, no! Not money.
Nothing to do with money.

33:41.569 --> 33:44.129
Please. You can say anything to me.
Very well. I shall.

33:47.969 --> 33:50.489
It has been suggested that you may
have developed

33:50.489 --> 33:52.209
a mild ardor for me.

33:52.209 --> 33:56.129
Something that could perhaps go
beyond what is proper

33:56.129 --> 33:58.849
if we are to continue on with our
domestic arrangement.

34:02.049 --> 34:04.129
Do you understand?

34:04.129 --> 34:06.489
You are asking me if I have fallen
in love with you?

34:06.489 --> 34:08.809
Well, yes. Well, no. No. I merely...

34:08.809 --> 34:11.009
It is true.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.129
I have.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.009
You've fallen in love with me?

34:18.009 --> 34:20.449
Is it so surprising? Well, frankly,
yes.

34:22.489 --> 34:26.489
I am so much older than you...
for a start. And...

34:26.489 --> 34:29.768
And then there are the cultural
differences not to mention the...

34:34.768 --> 34:36.809
I'm sorry. I can't.

34:36.809 --> 34:38.768
I can't.

34:45.289 --> 34:47.329
What is this, Frank?!
Just a second.

34:48.969 --> 34:53.289
Do you believe Mr. Selfridge is
responsible for the boots?!
Evidence is strong.

34:53.289 --> 34:55.609
How strong? This could ruin him.

34:55.609 --> 34:57.809
But if it's the truth, Kitty...
Truth?!

34:59.729 --> 35:02.169
What about character?! What about
loyalty?!

35:02.169 --> 35:05.849
In all the years you've known him
has he ever done anything like this?

35:06.689 --> 35:10.409
For a clever man, you can be a real
fool, Frank Edwards!

35:33.289 --> 35:35.209
You called, My Lady?

35:36.289 --> 35:38.209
Are you happy with me?

35:39.489 --> 35:41.449
Of course, My Lady.

35:45.529 --> 35:48.369
We've come a long way, haven't we,
since the Gaiety.

35:48.369 --> 35:51.009
Indeed, My Lady.

35:51.009 --> 35:52.929
I had a very good voice.

35:53.769 --> 35:55.769
Like an angel, My Lady.

35:55.769 --> 35:57.769
And I could dance too.

35:59.409 --> 36:01.449
After a fashion.

36:01.449 --> 36:05.809
Do you remember we used to be jealous
of those girls who got away?

36:05.809 --> 36:07.769
Married into money.

36:09.249 --> 36:11.329
I bet they talk about me
that way now.

36:11.329 --> 36:14.729
When they're putting on their makeup
and practicing their scales.

36:14.729 --> 36:17.129
You married well, My Lady.

36:20.169 --> 36:22.209
You never used to lie to me.

36:22.209 --> 36:24.289
Not when you were my dresser.

36:24.289 --> 36:26.809
You used to tell me what's what.

36:26.809 --> 36:28.769
Not that dress, Mae.

36:28.769 --> 36:32.409
It makes your ankles look like a dray
horse's fetlocks.

36:41.049 --> 36:44.449
You understand that I have to leave,
don't you?

36:44.449 --> 36:47.449
But you can stay if you want to.

36:48.529 --> 36:50.449
No...

36:50.449 --> 36:52.609
My Lady.

36:54.889 --> 36:56.849
I'll get your clothes.

37:01.289 --> 37:03.329
Oh, Jane...

37:03.329 --> 37:05.929
We only take what we came with. No
more, no less.

37:22.649 --> 37:24.689
Mr. Thackeray.

37:24.689 --> 37:27.129
I don't know if I can face him.

37:27.129 --> 37:29.369
If he truly is innocent.

37:32.009 --> 37:34.329
But you will.

37:36.529 --> 37:39.209
And I will make sure Mr. Selfridge
knows you did your best

37:39.209 --> 37:41.169
to repair the damage.

38:08.209 --> 38:10.289
Loxley.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.249
Ah, I wondered when you'd call.

38:15.249 --> 38:18.129
Really? Yes, I am available for a
comment.

38:26.169 --> 38:28.209
Lady Loxley.

38:28.209 --> 38:30.289
Rose, I'm sorry to call unannounced

38:30.289 --> 38:32.409
but there is something I must
discuss.

38:32.409 --> 38:34.609
I fear Loxley means to cause trouble
for Harry.

38:34.609 --> 38:37.889
I think you'll find he already has.

38:45.289 --> 38:47.249
You knew about this, didn't you?

38:48.849 --> 38:50.969
Didn't you?!

38:50.969 --> 38:55.769
You vouched for your husband. Harry
trusted you. I trusted you.

38:58.609 --> 39:00.769
I made a terrible mistake. I'm so
sorry.

39:03.049 --> 39:06.729
I promise I'm going to do everything
in my power to put this right.

39:06.729 --> 39:10.049
You must think I'm a fool. I want
nothing more to do with you.

39:10.049 --> 39:12.249
Never contact my husband or myself
again.

39:23.089 --> 39:25.049
I understand.

39:47.209 --> 39:49.369
Franco told me what you did.

39:50.449 --> 39:53.649
Getting Mr. Thackeray to confess.
Thank you.

39:53.649 --> 39:55.609
Well, I felt quite sorry for him.

39:57.249 --> 39:59.409
They're releasing Henri?
Yes.

39:59.409 --> 40:02.649
Mr. Thackeray has agreed to withdraw
his accusation.

40:02.649 --> 40:05.129
Good. I'm glad.

40:06.769 --> 40:10.289
I hope he finds his girl. Everyone
deserves a little happiness.

40:10.289 --> 40:12.049
Even the French.

40:14.729 --> 40:17.369
You know, you could have stopped me
from going there.

40:17.369 --> 40:20.689
Not every man would have been so
understanding. Yes, well...

40:20.689 --> 40:23.489
I trust you. Believe it or not.

40:23.489 --> 40:26.529
Well, I do love you.
Good job too.

40:47.689 --> 40:50.689
It's not too late, My Lady. We could
turn round.

40:52.649 --> 40:56.129
We've made our beds, Pimble. Looks
like it's time to lie in them.

41:09.369 --> 41:11.769
Mr. Grove, where is Monsieur Leclair?

41:11.769 --> 41:13.729
I'm afraid there's...

41:14.729 --> 41:16.849
..been a complication.

41:16.849 --> 41:19.209
The police have refused to release
him.

41:19.209 --> 41:23.409
I don't understand. They accepted Mr.
Thackeray's retraction? Indeed.

41:23.409 --> 41:25.409
But...

41:25.409 --> 41:27.209
it seems there's something else.

41:27.209 --> 41:31.049
Since being arrested, the police
have carried out some checks.

41:31.049 --> 41:34.249
They've contacted the American
police. Purely routine.

41:34.249 --> 41:36.569
But...

41:36.569 --> 41:37.969
What is it?

41:37.969 --> 41:41.529
Monsieur Leclair has been accused of
theft.

41:41.529 --> 41:43.809
In New York.

41:43.809 --> 41:47.689
He disappeared without answering
the charges. He's a fugitive.

41:49.969 --> 41:52.049
Henri Leclair is a wanted man.

42:00.729 --> 42:04.649
I thought she was gonna burst into
tears. She went as red as anything.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.969
It's a telegram.
