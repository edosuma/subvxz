WEBVTT

00:02.542 --> 00:03.625
(man on PA)
'Babylon control,
this is Transport Von Braun'

00:03.708 --> 00:05.250
'requesting docking clearance.'

00:05.333 --> 00:07.875
Transport Von Braun, you're
cleared for docking in Bay 7.

00:07.958 --> 00:09.875
(man on PA)
'Acknowledged, Babylon Control.'

00:09.958 --> 00:12.250
'We are proceeding to Bay 7.'

00:12.333 --> 00:15.958
(man on PA)
'Transport Von Braun,
lock on to beacon Alpha 5.'

00:16.042 --> 00:19.292
(man on PA)
'Affirmative,
dockside. Locking on.'

00:19.375 --> 00:21.417
(man on PA)
'Von Braun, do you need
any special handling?'

00:21.500 --> 00:25.083
(man on PA)
'Negative, we've just got
passengers on the usual..'

00:30.833 --> 00:33.917
They say food digests better
if you chew it first.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.500
Don't talk, I've seen you eat.

00:35.583 --> 00:37.250
Does the term Doppler effect
ring a bell?

00:37.333 --> 00:40.917
Commander Sinclair, I'm
surprised to see you here.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.917
Aren't you going to greet
our distinguished guest?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.917
'His ship is docking even now.'

00:46.000 --> 00:49.125
We wanted to be among the first
to offer our reverences.

00:49.208 --> 00:50.500
I wasn't informed.

00:50.583 --> 00:53.708
You will just have time
to change, if you hurry.

00:55.125 --> 00:57.792
To think that you have such
a man among your people.

00:59.042 --> 01:01.042
We must not keep him waiting.

01:03.958 --> 01:06.042
I'll take care of this for ya.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.958
It wouldn't hurt to have
an honor guard there

01:08.042 --> 01:10.083
if Delenn thinks
this is someone special.

01:10.750 --> 01:11.833
Got it.

01:12.667 --> 01:15.542
[intense music]

01:19.708 --> 01:22.625
Jinxo!
You've been avoiding me.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.750
Haven't I been good to you?
Done you a lot of favors?

01:27.833 --> 01:29.958
Huh? Loaned you money
when you needed it?

01:30.042 --> 01:33.708
Sure. You've been great.
Terrific.

01:33.792 --> 01:34.875
I can't thank you enough.

01:34.958 --> 01:37.125
And now it's time
for the payback.

01:38.875 --> 01:41.500
Station security's been
closing doors on me.

01:41.583 --> 01:43.917
I need to open up some
new supply quarters.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.542
You helped build this place.

01:47.625 --> 01:50.333
You know the ins and outs of B5
better than anybody.

01:51.417 --> 01:52.667
I don't know that much, Deuce.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.375
Honest. I was just
a construction worker.

01:55.458 --> 01:57.958
You know, big structural stuff.

01:58.042 --> 02:01.000
What you bring in, it's..

02:01.083 --> 02:03.208
Well, I can't be a part of that.

02:03.292 --> 02:05.333
Well, that's too bad.

02:05.417 --> 02:08.042
That means I'm gonna have to buy
that data somewhere else.

02:09.792 --> 02:12.042
So you're gonna have
to pay up on those old debts

02:12.667 --> 02:13.750
with interest.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.208
100,000 credits.

02:16.292 --> 02:18.208
What?

02:18.292 --> 02:21.542
I can't! Nobody could.

02:21.625 --> 02:23.958
Of course you can!
I'll show you why you can.

02:31.417 --> 02:34.625
Her name is Mirriam Runningdear.

02:34.708 --> 02:36.208
She talked
to the Ombuds about me.

02:36.292 --> 02:38.042
Even agreed to testify today.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.250
I told her that was a mistake.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.083
But some people
never get the message.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.667
[screaming]

03:02.500 --> 03:04.208
Do you get the message, Jinxo?

03:07.208 --> 03:08.417
Good!

03:08.500 --> 03:12.000
Now, I'm giving you 300 cycles

03:12.083 --> 03:14.125
to either get me
the credit you owe

03:14.208 --> 03:16.167
or the information I need.

03:16.250 --> 03:19.958
Three hundred cycles, Jinxo!
That's all I can afford.

03:20.042 --> 03:23.417
Because by then
he'll be hungry again.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.875
[slurping]

03:27.125 --> 03:29.708
'Won't you, Ambassador Kosh?'

03:32.542 --> 03:36.292
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

03:36.375 --> 03:39.458
ten years after
the Earth Minbari War.

03:39.542 --> 03:42.958
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

03:43.042 --> 03:45.083
Its goal,
to prevent another war

03:45.167 --> 03:47.625
by creating a place
where humans and aliens

03:47.708 --> 03:50.167
could work out their
differences peacefully.

03:50.250 --> 03:53.333
It's a port of call,
home away from home

03:53.417 --> 03:55.167
for diplomats, hustlers

03:55.250 --> 03:58.583
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.292
Humans and aliens, wrapped in

04:00.375 --> 04:02.833
two million five hundred
thousand tons

04:02.917 --> 04:06.583
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

04:08.292 --> 04:10.292
It can be a dangerous place.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.792
But it's our last
best hope for peace.

04:13.875 --> 04:15.500
This is the story of the last

04:15.583 --> 04:17.625
of the Babylon stations.

04:17.708 --> 04:20.000
The year is 2258.

04:20.083 --> 04:23.542
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.208
[theme music]

04:56.125 --> 04:58.792
[music continues]

05:02.792 --> 05:03.833
[instrumental music]

05:05.417 --> 05:08.500
Well, Your Honor, a few days
later my great-grandfather Amis

05:08.583 --> 05:10.458
came back into town
and told everyone

05:10.542 --> 05:13.375
he'd been taken
away on this ship by aliens.

05:13.458 --> 05:15.500
They held him for two days,
doing experiments

05:15.583 --> 05:17.000
they were sticking him
with needles

05:17.083 --> 05:18.125
and they were flashing lights--

05:18.208 --> 05:19.708
To the point please, Mr. Flinn.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.375
I was just getting
there, Your Honor.

05:21.458 --> 05:22.708
Everybody figured
he was a little nuts

05:22.792 --> 05:24.375
you know what I mean?

05:24.458 --> 05:26.458
'He couldn't get a job, his
children were shut out'

05:26.542 --> 05:28.208
from everybody in town.

05:28.292 --> 05:31.708
Nobody believed him. And that's
why I'm here today, Your Honor.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.583
We went through their archives,
we found proof

05:33.667 --> 05:36.750
that his great-grandfather
abducted my great-grandfather

05:36.833 --> 05:38.667
and just took him away
in his spaceship.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.958
Frankly,
Your Honor, we want damages.

05:42.208 --> 05:43.458
How do you plead?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.667
[instrumental music]

05:47.750 --> 05:50.083
Could I please have
a translation team in here?

05:51.500 --> 05:54.625
Why is it Ombuds Zimmerman
never gets these cases?

05:55.750 --> 05:57.083
Only me.

05:59.833 --> 06:03.625
(man on PA)
'Repeat, Transport Von Braun
has docked at Bay 7.'

06:03.708 --> 06:05.958
'Please meet arrivals
in passenger lounge.'

06:07.208 --> 06:10.333
[speaking in foreign language]

06:17.625 --> 06:19.417
That is him.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.917
- You've met him before?
- No, but he has the look.

06:25.708 --> 06:29.458
Do we have the privilege
of greeting Aldous Gajic?

06:29.542 --> 06:31.917
Ambassador Delenn,
I did not expect

06:32.000 --> 06:34.792
to meet a person
of such importance.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.875
'You do me a great honor.'

06:37.875 --> 06:40.292
I take it that you are Lennier?

06:40.375 --> 06:43.333
Yes. I'm very pleased.

06:44.750 --> 06:47.125
This is Commander Sinclair.

06:47.208 --> 06:50.167
This is my security chief,
Mr. Garibaldi.

06:50.250 --> 06:53.583
- I'm sorry, Mr. Gajic, but I--
- Just Aldous, please.

06:53.667 --> 06:56.708
I'm afraid I wasn't notified
that you were coming, or why?

06:56.792 --> 06:58.667
That's entirely my fault,
commander

06:58.750 --> 07:00.500
since my business
isn't Earth related

07:00.583 --> 07:02.333
I didn't think to inform you.

07:02.417 --> 07:05.542
I sent information packets
ahead to the ambassadors

07:05.625 --> 07:08.000
to facilitate my mission
when I arrive.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.500
Which is?

07:09.583 --> 07:13.292
(Aldous)
I am seeking the Sacred
Vessel of Regeneration

07:13.375 --> 07:16.375
known also as
the Cup of the Goddess.

07:17.542 --> 07:19.583
Or by its more common name..

07:21.417 --> 07:23.000
...the Holy Grail.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.375
The Holy Grail?

07:31.083 --> 07:34.542
As in King Arthur?

07:35.583 --> 07:36.792
'The Last Supper?'

07:36.875 --> 07:40.250
It has many names
but only one promise.

07:40.333 --> 07:44.792
The regeneration
and salvation of humankind.

07:44.875 --> 07:47.542
My order has been searching
for the grail for millennia

07:47.625 --> 07:49.750
since there's nowhere else left
on Earth to search

07:49.833 --> 07:53.208
I've taken the search outward
to other worlds.

07:53.292 --> 07:56.125
That's why I'm asking for
the help of the ambassadors.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.583
What kind of help?

07:57.667 --> 08:01.542
(Aldous)
'I assure you,
I seek only knowledge.'

08:01.625 --> 08:04.083
All the funds of my order
are at my disposal

08:04.167 --> 08:07.875
although I regret to say at this
time, I am the entire order.

08:07.958 --> 08:11.250
But if you have any doubts,
please feel free to investigate.

08:11.333 --> 08:12.875
We look forward
to meeting with you

08:12.958 --> 08:15.792
at the appointed hour,
Honored Seeker.

08:17.833 --> 08:19.875
(Aldous)
'Oh, uh, commander,
I don't mean to bother you'

08:19.958 --> 08:21.750
but I need
to exchange some credits

08:21.833 --> 08:23.917
if, uh, you could point the way.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.792
Mr. Garibaldi can show you
to the nearest exchange machine.

08:28.042 --> 08:29.208
Mr. Garibaldi?

08:32.458 --> 08:34.000
Mr. Garibaldi would be
delighted.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.167
This way.

08:38.250 --> 08:43.458
Commander, I'm puzzled
by your reaction to Mr. Gajic.

08:43.542 --> 08:46.167
Do you object to his mission?

08:46.250 --> 08:48.875
On Earth, the Grail is nothing
but a myth.

08:48.958 --> 08:50.917
It's a nice story
to tell your kids.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.917
For someone who's spend his
entire life looking for it is..

08:54.000 --> 08:57.250
Well, it's not often
taken very seriously.

08:57.333 --> 09:03.500
How sad.
He is a holy man. A true seeker.

09:03.583 --> 09:05.542
Among my people,
a true seeker is

09:05.625 --> 09:08.625
treated with the utmost
reverence and respect.

09:08.708 --> 09:12.042
It doesn't matter that
his Grail may or may not exist.

09:12.125 --> 09:16.292
What matters is that he strives
for the perfection of his soul

09:16.375 --> 09:18.500
and the salvation of his race.

09:18.583 --> 09:21.625
And that he has never wavered
or lost faith.

09:21.708 --> 09:26.458
I wish him luck. He's probably
the only true seeker we have.

09:26.542 --> 09:29.375
Then perhaps
you do not know yourself

09:29.458 --> 09:30.750
as well as you think.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.458
[beeping]
Sinclair.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.208
(male #1)
'Can you come to Medlab
right away?'

09:41.292 --> 09:42.958
'We have another brainwipe
victim.'

09:45.417 --> 09:48.500
[indistinct chatter]

09:51.292 --> 09:54.042
Jinxo! Hold it right there.

09:54.125 --> 09:56.125
Man, you never get
any better at this.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.500
Oh, look, I needed the money.
Lost my head.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.167
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Same old story.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.375
Mr. Gajic?

10:07.417 --> 10:09.458
You need to find a more secure
place for your money.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.042
And I'll have to ask you
to come along while we settle

10:11.125 --> 10:13.167
'this with the Ombuds.'

10:13.250 --> 10:14.625
I'd rather not.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.083
In this instance,
I'll have to insist.

10:16.167 --> 10:17.958
You're a material witness.

10:18.042 --> 10:19.292
It won't take long.

10:23.875 --> 10:26.833
(Stephen)
'She was found in Downbelow
just like the other two.'

10:26.917 --> 10:28.750
'Same highly selective pattern.'

10:28.833 --> 10:30.875
'Total absence of any normal
brainwave activity'

10:30.958 --> 10:33.583
associated with memory
or personality.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.375
Fused synapses

10:35.458 --> 10:38.125
barely enough to keep
the autonomic functions going

10:38.208 --> 10:40.833
I don't know if any machine
that could do that.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.083
Can you save her?

10:42.167 --> 10:44.375
Well, she was found
right after the wipe

10:44.458 --> 10:46.500
so there's a good chance.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.208
But she lost her
entire life experience

10:48.292 --> 10:50.958
so we'll have to retrain her
from infancy back to adulthood

10:51.042 --> 10:52.500
and that won't be easy.

10:53.458 --> 10:54.750
Just got the word.

10:54.833 --> 10:57.042
Another lurker had
his brain mulched.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.458
Make me a happy man.
Let me clean out Downbelow.

10:59.542 --> 11:01.208
If I put all my teams out
and I could wipe out

11:01.292 --> 11:03.125
'9/10 of the crime rate
in one sweep.'

11:03.208 --> 11:05.500
Most of them are just people
with nowhere else to go.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.708
They come here looking
for a new life, a new job

11:07.792 --> 11:09.250
and when they don't find it,
they can't afford

11:09.333 --> 11:10.458
to transport back.

11:10.542 --> 11:11.833
What are you gonna do,
Mr. Garibaldi

11:11.917 --> 11:13.833
'shove them out an air lock?'

11:13.917 --> 11:17.083
Don't tempt me.
So, who's the victim?

11:17.167 --> 11:18.292
Well, she's..

11:19.417 --> 11:21.917
Was Mirriam Runningdear.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.292
What?

11:28.333 --> 11:30.000
Damn.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.083
(Garibaldi)
'She ran that shop in Red 26.'

11:33.417 --> 11:34.958
She was the only person
with enough guts

11:35.042 --> 11:36.708
to testify against
that lurker rad Deuce

11:36.792 --> 11:38.083
and his protection racket.

11:38.167 --> 11:39.750
The trial's today,
and he's gonna walk free

11:39.833 --> 11:42.292
because she's lying in there
and reduced to a rutabaga.

11:42.375 --> 11:44.583
Go ahead and tell me
that's a coincidence.

11:44.667 --> 11:45.958
Now can I take the place apart?

11:46.042 --> 11:48.875
Now you can give
the Ombuds the bad news.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.167
'I'll consider
the Downbelow problem later.'

11:51.250 --> 11:52.542
Doctor, I need more
information on what is

11:52.625 --> 11:53.958
causing these brainwipes.

11:54.042 --> 11:56.042
We have to know whether or not
it's tied to Deuce.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.458
And if it is?

11:59.958 --> 12:01.167
Then we hurt him.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.500
Thomas Jordan.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.708
This is your third arrest
for petty

12:12.792 --> 12:16.042
'not to mention incompetent
thievery.'

12:16.125 --> 12:18.042
'Now, you have an excellent
history as a grade ten'

12:18.125 --> 12:19.625
'zero gravity constructor'

12:19.708 --> 12:22.917
on all five
of the Babylon stations.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.625
You could get
a good job in your field

12:24.708 --> 12:27.958
in a dozen places
within a jump of here.

12:28.042 --> 12:32.000
In view of this,
I will be lenient.

12:32.083 --> 12:35.208
You will depart, fare paid
by the Ombudsman Office

12:35.292 --> 12:37.083
on the next outward flight.

12:37.167 --> 12:40.417
'You are barred from reentry
to this station for a period'

12:40.500 --> 12:42.125
'of five years.'

12:42.208 --> 12:44.708
You can't do that!
I've got to stay here!

12:44.792 --> 12:46.375
Please,
I don't care what you do to me.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.500
'Put me in jail! Make me clean
the methane toilets!'

12:48.583 --> 12:50.250
'I don't care, I've got
to stay on the station'

12:50.333 --> 12:51.625
'or it's the end
of this station!'

12:51.708 --> 12:53.125
'And every man
and woman and child'

12:53.208 --> 12:54.458
'and alien on this station'

12:54.542 --> 12:56.375
just like all the others.

12:56.458 --> 12:58.667
Ombuds Wellington,
if I could have a word?

12:58.750 --> 13:00.542
Approach.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.708
Yes?

13:08.083 --> 13:10.292
[indistinct whispering]

13:16.083 --> 13:18.875
Although I fear I may have
temporarily taken leave

13:18.958 --> 13:22.292
of my sanity, I hereby
withdraw my former judgment

13:22.375 --> 13:26.542
'and remand Thomas
into the remedial custody'

13:26.625 --> 13:28.250
'of Aldous Gajic.'

13:28.333 --> 13:31.417
[indistinct chatter]

13:32.417 --> 13:34.833
[gavel banging]

13:38.458 --> 13:41.667
Jinxo, 240 cycles left!

13:43.000 --> 13:45.167
[gavel banging]

13:48.042 --> 13:50.333
(Wellington)
'Desmond Muzychenko.'

13:51.667 --> 13:55.833
You stand accused of extortion.
How do you plead?

13:56.625 --> 13:58.125
Not guilty.

13:58.208 --> 14:01.250
Will Mirriam Runningdear come
forward, please?

14:01.333 --> 14:04.667
Mirriam's in Medlab,
just barely alive.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.292
'She's been brainwiped.'

14:06.375 --> 14:10.542
I see. Is there other evidence
to be presented?

14:10.625 --> 14:12.750
The secondary evidence
previously submitted--

14:12.833 --> 14:14.750
Is insufficient.

14:14.833 --> 14:17.458
I deeply regret this,
Mr. Garibaldi, but I am unable

14:17.542 --> 14:19.375
to proceed without a witness.

14:20.417 --> 14:22.125
Case dismissed!

14:22.208 --> 14:25.417
Why'd you help me?
I've never even seen you before.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.458
My brother's burdens are my own.

14:28.542 --> 14:30.417
What I want to know
is why you believe

14:30.500 --> 14:33.083
you can't leave this station?

14:33.167 --> 14:35.458
'Cause if I do,
it'll blow up or disappear

14:35.542 --> 14:37.708
or something else awful
like that will happen.

14:37.792 --> 14:40.458
Come on, laugh.
Everyone else does.

14:40.542 --> 14:43.458
But it's real.
The Babylon Curse.

14:43.542 --> 14:47.458
I'm not laughing, Thomas. I
understand obsession very well.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.583
I've spent the better part
of my life searching

14:49.667 --> 14:52.250
for something that
no one else believes in.

14:52.333 --> 14:55.375
And I will continue searching
until I die.

14:55.458 --> 14:58.792
Listen, you've been decent
to me, so I gotta warn you.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.250
About 200 cycles from now

15:00.333 --> 15:02.375
that guy Deuce is gonna send
his hoogs for me.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.625
When that happens, promise me,
you'll get off this station

15:04.708 --> 15:05.917
right then and there.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.583
Take any ship,
do whatever you gotta do

15:07.667 --> 15:09.292
just get off the station.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.458
We'll deal with that
when the time comes.

15:12.417 --> 15:14.583
Tell me..

15:14.667 --> 15:18.500
...how did you get
this Babylon Curse?

15:18.583 --> 15:20.167
Don't you get it?

15:20.250 --> 15:21.542
Did you ever wonder
what really happened

15:21.625 --> 15:23.333
to the first four Babylon
stations?

15:24.083 --> 15:25.167
I did.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.667
I don't have the curse.
I am the curse.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.333
I was too young
to fight in the Minbari war

15:37.417 --> 15:39.667
so when I got the chance to work
space construction

15:39.750 --> 15:42.083
I jumped for it.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.583
The day I went to work
on the Babylon station

15:44.667 --> 15:46.250
we didn't number
them at first, you know.

15:46.333 --> 15:49.375
I thought that was
the best day of my life.

15:49.458 --> 15:52.750
I worked a few months,
had some leaves so I took it

15:52.833 --> 15:56.375
and the station's
infrastructure collapsed.

15:56.458 --> 15:59.125
Sabotaged.
They never found out who.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.667
I remember.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.875
So I went to work
on the second one.

16:02.958 --> 16:03.958
The firm still owned my contract

16:04.042 --> 16:05.500
till the station was finished.

16:05.583 --> 16:09.042
I took leave a second time
and that station was sabotaged.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.625
And then when B3 blew up, well

16:11.708 --> 16:13.917
that's when
I got the name Jinxo.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.583
When I went to work on B4,
I didn't take any leave

16:16.667 --> 16:18.958
I was there every minute
till we finished it.

16:19.042 --> 16:20.250
I thought the curse was gone.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.667
As I was leaving on the shuttle,
I looked back..

16:23.750 --> 16:26.875
...and the station just
sort of wrinkled.

16:26.958 --> 16:30.750
Twisted like putty,
then just disappeared.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.333
The minute I left.

16:32.417 --> 16:36.000
So when they decided to build
B5, I had to work on it.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.792
And I have to stay.
I have to.

16:37.875 --> 16:40.083
I'd say that
you have the wrong nickname.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.875
They should have
called you "Lucky."

16:42.000 --> 16:43.583
How do you figure?

16:43.667 --> 16:45.250
To have escaped the worst each

16:45.333 --> 16:46.292
time that's a blessing.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.833
You're a very lucky man.

16:48.917 --> 16:51.250
Perhaps each time
you were exactly

16:51.333 --> 16:52.708
where you were meant to be.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.333
I never thought of it like that.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.292
We never do.

16:57.375 --> 16:59.417
I understand how you feel,
but you can't post

16:59.500 --> 17:02.333
security men everywhere
just to catch Deuce in the act.

17:02.417 --> 17:03.875
You need to find
another witness.

17:03.958 --> 17:05.417
When the word gets out
about Mirriam

17:05.500 --> 17:06.875
I've got as much
chance of doing that

17:06.958 --> 17:09.625
as seeing a Vorlon
do a striptease.

17:09.708 --> 17:11.125
Commander, we found something
that may explain

17:11.208 --> 17:12.833
the brainwipe victims.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.917
Once I ruled out the possibility
of a machine

17:15.000 --> 17:16.500
that left only something organic

17:16.583 --> 17:18.875
so I ran a search on
the xenobiogenic file.

17:18.958 --> 17:20.417
It turned up
a quasi-sentient beast

17:20.500 --> 17:21.917
called the Na'ka'leen Feeder

17:22.000 --> 17:24.125
'kept under heavy quarantine
in the Centauri sector.'

17:24.208 --> 17:26.625
(Stephen)
'Not much there,
not even a visual record'

17:26.708 --> 17:28.583
'but the description of the
brainwipe effects is too close'

17:28.667 --> 17:30.042
'to discount.'

17:30.125 --> 17:32.833
I believe one of the feeders
had been smuggled on board.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.708
It's Deuce. Gotta be.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.875
His bunch were all set up to
smuggle in something like this.

17:36.958 --> 17:39.125
I wonder how much Londo knows
about that sector.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.208
It's in his jurisdiction.

17:41.292 --> 17:43.250
I don't suppose
you know where he is?

17:43.333 --> 17:44.917
Where else?

17:45.000 --> 17:49.125
Stinking 17! Gah!

17:49.208 --> 17:50.583
(male #2)
'Sorry, ambassador.'

17:50.667 --> 17:52.125
Take your..
You're thieves.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.542
Ambassador.

17:53.625 --> 17:56.417
Sinclair, my good friend,
what can I do for you?

17:56.500 --> 17:57.792
A drink, perhaps?

17:57.875 --> 17:59.875
I'm looking for some
information on a life form

17:59.958 --> 18:01.875
in Centauri jurisdiction.

18:01.958 --> 18:03.125
A Na'ka'leen Feeder.

18:03.208 --> 18:08.292
[growls]
Hideous creatures. Hideous!

18:08.375 --> 18:10.875
We came across them
in our colonizing days.

18:10.958 --> 18:15.000
We lost an entire colony
before we threw up a quarantine.

18:16.875 --> 18:20.167
The only good Na'ka'leen
is a dead Na'ka'leen.

18:24.125 --> 18:27.750
This is, of course,
a purely theoretical question.

18:27.833 --> 18:31.083
A whim of yours,
that, that you might ask yes?

18:31.167 --> 18:32.917
Well, not really.

18:35.833 --> 18:38.000
[indistinct]

18:38.083 --> 18:40.708
There couldn't be. Here?

18:40.792 --> 18:44.958
I'll have Vir transfer the files
to you immediately.

18:45.042 --> 18:48.625
If you want me, I'll be in my
quarters under top security.

18:48.708 --> 18:51.250
I strongly suggest
you do the same.

19:01.958 --> 19:03.917
It is my sorrow
to tell you that the Grail

19:04.000 --> 19:06.542
is not in the possession
of the Minbari

19:06.625 --> 19:09.875
nor have we heard of it
previous to your visit.

19:09.958 --> 19:12.833
We searched our records
very thoroughly, honored..

19:12.917 --> 19:16.167
and we regret if the news
disappoints.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.708
You have been kind
beyond my expectations

19:19.792 --> 19:24.708
and I am grateful beyond
my ability to express it.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.792
I have sent word to my Homeworld

19:26.875 --> 19:30.542
which will then be relayed to
all of our outposts in colonies.

19:30.625 --> 19:33.917
If there is any news
about this Grail..

19:34.000 --> 19:37.583
...our people will find you
and bring it to you.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.333
(Thomas)
'That's really nice.'

19:39.417 --> 19:42.333
I mean, with the war and all,
I figured you folks would..

19:43.208 --> 19:44.458
Well, you know..

19:44.542 --> 19:46.625
There are two castes of Minbari

19:46.708 --> 19:49.917
the warrior caste
and the religious caste.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.167
The warrior caste would not
understand. It is not their way.

19:55.250 --> 19:59.708
So we will not tell them,
and spare them the confusion.

19:59.792 --> 20:04.500
These two sides of your culture,
do they ever agree on anything?

20:04.583 --> 20:09.792
Yes, and when they do,
it is a terrible thing.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.667
A terrible power,
as recent events have shown us.

20:15.208 --> 20:20.708
Let us hope it never again
happens in our lifetime.

20:20.792 --> 20:22.917
[intense music]

20:24.708 --> 20:26.792
I heard there was a problem.

20:26.875 --> 20:32.125
More food. Richer food.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.375
'Older minds.'

20:35.333 --> 20:38.250
Want more. Want--

20:38.333 --> 20:39.875
We're already setting it up.

20:39.958 --> 20:42.625
'Find Jinxo and the Ombuds.
Bring them here.'

20:44.250 --> 20:46.042
You'll dine well, soon enough.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.958
This is top security stuff.

20:55.042 --> 20:56.500
I'm surprised Londo gave it
to you so easily.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.042
He couldn't do it fast enough.

20:58.125 --> 21:00.167
He's locked himself
in his room for the duration.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.042
You think we should
issue a general advisory?

21:02.125 --> 21:05.375
Not yet. It won't help
to panic the entire station.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.333
So far, it seems to be staying
at Downbelow.

21:07.417 --> 21:09.000
We could issue a section alert.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.500
That'd tip Deuce off for sure.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.333
I'd like to avoid
that as long as possible.

21:13.417 --> 21:16.583
Commander.
We just finished the new test.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.083
It's definitely a Feeder.

21:18.167 --> 21:20.250
After factoring in the Centauri
brainwave differences

21:20.333 --> 21:21.542
patterns are almost identical.

21:21.625 --> 21:23.167
Alright,
that's all we need to know.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.917
Run a check on the registry
and inventory

21:25.000 --> 21:27.042
of every ship that passed
through the Centauri sector

21:27.125 --> 21:29.375
and docked here
in the last 90 days.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.917
I'm gonna track down a little
thief named Jinxo.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.875
I saw Deuce talking
to him in the court room.

21:35.958 --> 21:38.000
Maybe he knows how
that Feeder got on board.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.708
Did you know that Aldous
character agreed

21:41.792 --> 21:44.917
to rehabilitate Jinxo,
you think he's genuine?

21:45.000 --> 21:48.500
Aldous? Yes.
Question is, a genuine what?

21:48.583 --> 21:51.250
One person's lunatic is
another's true seeker.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.125
You've been hanging out
with Delenn too much.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.208
(Londo)
'I don't care
who authorized it!'

21:58.292 --> 22:00.542
'I don't care how old
the quarantine is!'

22:00.625 --> 22:02.625
I don't care about the budget

22:02.708 --> 22:06.208
and I certainly don't care about
how much trouble it is for you!

22:06.292 --> 22:08.792
'We're talking about
the most dangerous beast'

22:08.875 --> 22:10.542
'in the entire sector!'

22:10.625 --> 22:12.542
Find someone who can say yes

22:12.625 --> 22:15.042
and put the quarantine
back in place!

22:17.000 --> 22:20.375
Now, what are they doing
in here?

22:20.458 --> 22:23.958
He has an appointment.
This is Aldous Gajic.

22:24.042 --> 22:25.750
The Earther who's looking
for the cup object

22:25.833 --> 22:27.750
called the Holy Grail.

22:27.833 --> 22:29.625
I was hoping with
our long trade history

22:29.708 --> 22:33.000
between Earth and Centauri
that you'd make a good prospect.

22:33.083 --> 22:35.167
Yes, yes, yes. Now I remember.

22:35.250 --> 22:38.292
We'll have to do a search
of our trade history files.

22:38.375 --> 22:41.042
Very complicated
and time consuming.

22:41.125 --> 22:42.917
However if you can
afford the fees..

22:43.000 --> 22:45.542
Ambassador,
I've already done it.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.458
I thought it would help
move things along.

22:50.167 --> 22:53.208
You know, it was an interesting
challenge, really

22:53.292 --> 22:56.333
given that you provided us
with only minimal description.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.208
There's nothing
that seems to fit exactly--

22:58.292 --> 22:59.750
Vir..

22:59.833 --> 23:02.083
But you're more than welcome
to examine this data crystal.

23:02.167 --> 23:04.167
Vir! What are you doing?

23:05.250 --> 23:06.958
Being efficient, sir.

23:07.042 --> 23:10.583
A few more like you, Vir,
and the entire Centauri republic

23:10.667 --> 23:13.625
will "efficient" itself
to extinction!

23:13.708 --> 23:15.708
I think we should leave now.

23:15.792 --> 23:18.042
What a wonderful idea. Please.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.667
Thank you for your time,
ambassador.

23:25.542 --> 23:28.292
No one else is to come in,
is that clear?

23:28.375 --> 23:30.750
Yes, sir.

23:30.833 --> 23:34.583
[sighs]
Fools to the left of me,
Feeders to the right!

23:36.375 --> 23:38.667
I need to find a real job.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.542
So what are gonna do with
the Grail once you find it?

23:44.625 --> 23:46.333
Heal people.

23:46.417 --> 23:49.667
Perhaps it's powerful enough
to heal all humankind.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.167
If I hadn't gotten
to know you, I'd swear

23:51.250 --> 23:53.708
you were a few Gs
short of floating off.

23:53.792 --> 23:56.500
I mean, how did you get into
this in the first place?

24:07.583 --> 24:10.583
I kept the accounts for one of
the major Earth corporation.

24:10.667 --> 24:15.542
I lived in a world of numbers.
Clean, smooth.

24:15.625 --> 24:17.125
Logical, precise.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.125
We took a vacation
to visit the Mars colony

24:22.208 --> 24:24.917
the first time we'd ever been.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.833
We were in a crawler, halfway
across the Amazonis Planitia

24:29.917 --> 24:32.708
when suddenly the ground
gave way beneath us.

24:32.792 --> 24:35.458
I woke up in a hospital
with a few bumps and bruises

24:35.542 --> 24:38.000
but Sarah..

24:39.625 --> 24:42.292
...and the children, gone.

24:45.292 --> 24:47.042
I'm sorry.

24:47.125 --> 24:48.708
Oh.

24:48.792 --> 24:50.542
I grieved for a long time.

24:52.167 --> 24:53.417
A very long time.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.208
But eventually
I went back to work

24:58.292 --> 25:02.458
but...the numbers didn't
add up anymore

25:02.542 --> 25:03.917
nothing makes sense anymore

25:04.000 --> 25:06.750
so finally,
one day I just left..

25:06.833 --> 25:08.792
...believing that there
had to be something..

25:10.708 --> 25:14.833
...some reason
why I had been spared.

25:17.542 --> 25:19.917
And then I met a man.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.917
He said
he was the last of his kind.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.458
And he told me
that I was a man..

25:26.542 --> 25:29.917
...of infinite promise
and goodness.

25:32.083 --> 25:33.542
And when he was dying..

25:35.000 --> 25:36.583
...he gave me this staff.

25:39.958 --> 25:41.417
And now I'm the last.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.042
'But the numbers add up again,
Thomas.'

25:46.792 --> 25:49.792
The numbers do add up.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.792
Until such time as both
the defendant and plaintiff

25:53.875 --> 25:56.458
can come
to some reasonable solution

25:56.542 --> 25:57.875
to the problem of jurisdiction

25:57.958 --> 26:01.958
this court will recess
for 30 minutes.

26:02.042 --> 26:03.208
All rise!

26:13.542 --> 26:16.208
[beeping]

26:17.750 --> 26:19.292
[grunting]

26:19.375 --> 26:21.667
So what does this Grail look
like? Is it made of gold?

26:21.750 --> 26:22.958
Jewels, that sort of thing?

26:23.042 --> 26:24.375
I don't know,
I've never seen it.

26:24.458 --> 26:25.542
How can you find something
if you don't even

26:25.625 --> 26:26.958
know what it looks like?

26:27.042 --> 26:29.167
Sometimes it's the search that
counts, not the finding.

26:29.250 --> 26:32.000
- Hey, Jinxo, it's time.
- 'We've come to collect.'

26:32.083 --> 26:33.833
- Wait, you gotta listen..
- Too late.

26:33.917 --> 26:38.333
This is my friend. He's under
my protection. Please leave.

26:38.417 --> 26:39.750
Get lost.

26:39.833 --> 26:42.875
[grunting]

26:46.083 --> 26:49.125
Shall we go?

26:50.792 --> 26:53.167
Man, oh, man,
you shouldn't have done that.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.458
I mean, it was great,
but you don't know what..

26:55.542 --> 26:59.000
Oh, they're gonna be so..
Hey, can I learn to do that?

26:59.083 --> 27:00.917
You can learn
whatever you want to learn

27:01.000 --> 27:03.542
because you are a man of
infinite promise and goodness.

27:03.625 --> 27:05.167
Oh, come off it!

27:05.250 --> 27:09.125
The very fact that you're still
here on B5 is proof of that.

27:10.375 --> 27:12.500
You care so much
for the people on this station

27:12.583 --> 27:15.292
that you stay here
at the risk of your own life.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.708
You are a fine, good man,
Thomas.

27:18.792 --> 27:20.792
See yourself
for what you are

27:21.958 --> 27:23.708
not what others
try to make you.

27:33.125 --> 27:35.250
[machine whirring]

27:36.500 --> 27:37.750
Well, Thomas..

27:39.125 --> 27:41.958
...this is our last stop.

27:42.042 --> 27:45.750
If he doesn't know where it is,
I'll have to move on.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.667
[intense music]

27:59.000 --> 28:00.500
So who are we seeing now?

28:03.750 --> 28:05.167
Ah, ambassador.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.792
No! Get away from him!

28:06.875 --> 28:09.417
Get away, we've gotta get out
of here. He'll eat your mind!

28:09.500 --> 28:11.208
- Thomas!
- I saw him! I saw him do it.

28:11.292 --> 28:14.083
- He sucked her brain dry!
- Thomas!

28:14.167 --> 28:16.542
Excuse me, ambassador.
Perhaps later?

28:16.625 --> 28:19.208
[intense music]

28:22.958 --> 28:24.500
Thomas, answer me!

28:25.500 --> 28:27.583
I know you're there.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.708
What the hell did you
come down here for?

28:34.208 --> 28:39.292
That thing. Gosh, you didn't see
what it did. It was terrible.

28:39.375 --> 28:42.708
Thomas, whatever you saw,
it's obviously important.

28:42.792 --> 28:45.792
But if it involves a Vorlon, you
must inform Commander Sinclair.

28:45.875 --> 28:46.833
No!

28:46.917 --> 28:48.333
You can't run away
all your life!

28:48.417 --> 28:52.125
Just get on a ship and leave
right now. Promise me!

28:52.208 --> 28:53.625
Come with me
and see the commander.

28:54.583 --> 28:56.083
Tell him what you know.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.125
- I'll be right with you.
- 'There they are!'

28:58.208 --> 29:00.208
[dramatic music]

29:02.125 --> 29:03.667
[grunting]

29:03.750 --> 29:05.583
[screaming]

29:11.208 --> 29:14.083
Jinxo, come on out!

29:15.625 --> 29:17.042
We've got the geezer.

29:18.833 --> 29:20.458
'You hear me?'

29:20.542 --> 29:22.583
'You got ten minutes
to reach Deuce.'

29:23.458 --> 29:25.708
If you don't show

29:25.792 --> 29:27.625
we feed your friend
to the Vorlon.

29:38.583 --> 29:41.167
Any luck finding out how that
Feeder got out of the station?

29:41.250 --> 29:43.875
89 ships came through the
Centauri sector on the way here

29:43.958 --> 29:46.458
in the 90 days prior
to the first brainwipe victim.

29:46.542 --> 29:48.792
Half of them were in proximity
of the quarantine planet.

29:48.875 --> 29:50.542
Eliminating those
with spotless records

29:50.625 --> 29:54.042
or no exchange of cargos still
leaves me with 24 possibilities.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.250
- With any luck we can--
- I've Garibaldi's on the link.

29:56.958 --> 29:58.375
Sinclair.

29:58.458 --> 30:01.458
Ombuds Wellington didn't make it
back to court after his recess.

30:01.542 --> 30:03.375
One of my people checked it out
and called me in.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.917
'I checked his quarters
and the place is a mess.'

30:06.000 --> 30:07.583
'Looks like he put up
a hell of a fight.'

30:07.667 --> 30:09.708
Witness says he saw someone
hanging around earlier.

30:09.792 --> 30:12.500
From the description, sounds
like one of Deuce's men.

30:12.583 --> 30:14.083
I'm on my way.

30:20.167 --> 30:21.875
If there's any pain,
don't worry.

30:21.958 --> 30:23.250
It won't last long.

30:23.333 --> 30:26.208
[intense music]

30:35.875 --> 30:38.917
Get out while you still can.

30:48.375 --> 30:50.458
Commander!

30:50.542 --> 30:52.833
No, wait. Wait, you gotta help
me! They got Aldous!

30:52.917 --> 30:54.917
They took him and Deuce is gonna
feed him to the Vorlon!

30:55.000 --> 30:56.417
- Vorlon?
- Like the woman.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.250
And he ate her mind.
And he's gonna eat Aldous.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.375
- You gotta help me. Now.
- I'll get security team.

31:00.458 --> 31:02.167
Garibaldi, track my signal,
Jinxo's taking me

31:02.250 --> 31:03.958
to Deuce and the Feeder,
they got Aldous too.

31:04.042 --> 31:05.500
Get a security team there
on the double.

31:05.583 --> 31:06.917
- 'Will do.'
- Let's go!

31:11.000 --> 31:13.375
[hissing]

31:23.708 --> 31:26.542
This man is under my protection.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.958
What are you doing?
Save yourself!

31:29.042 --> 31:31.542
[intense music]

31:48.000 --> 31:51.042
There is nothing in the dark.
No fear.

31:52.583 --> 31:53.958
No pain.

31:55.125 --> 31:56.500
Only the light.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.167
Show yourself.

32:02.083 --> 32:03.542
Show yourself.

32:04.417 --> 32:06.875
[hissing]

32:42.458 --> 32:45.208
[explosion]

32:45.292 --> 32:47.083
- Security!
- Let's go! Go! Go!

32:47.167 --> 32:50.250
Peters, Fernando, Carver,
McLane, go after those bozos!

32:52.083 --> 32:53.958
[dramatic music]

33:05.250 --> 33:07.042
[indistinct]

33:09.333 --> 33:11.583
[screeching]

33:15.458 --> 33:16.667
What's the situation?

33:16.750 --> 33:18.917
The Feeder's in here somewhere.
So is Aldous.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.500
[instrumental music]

33:55.375 --> 33:57.750
[screaming]

34:08.000 --> 34:11.583
You'll be okay.
Just a second more.

34:14.083 --> 34:15.667
Thomas!

34:15.750 --> 34:17.208
Look out!

34:18.625 --> 34:19.958
Aldous!

34:21.792 --> 34:23.250
[groans]

34:31.708 --> 34:33.292
Take him!

34:48.417 --> 34:50.542
Dr. Franklin,
medical emergency in Brown 9.

34:50.625 --> 34:52.208
I'll have a man standing
by to guide you in.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.792
- It's too late.
- Don't say that!

34:56.875 --> 34:58.333
You're gonna be fine.

34:58.417 --> 35:02.667
No. My search is over.

35:04.375 --> 35:05.667
I've failed.

35:07.333 --> 35:10.542
No one left. No one.

35:12.500 --> 35:15.542
Yes, there is. I'll do it.

35:16.625 --> 35:19.083
I'll find the Grail.

35:19.167 --> 35:22.750
- Thomas..
- I want to do it.

35:22.833 --> 35:26.708
I'll find it, Aldous.
I swear I'll find it.

35:29.042 --> 35:31.292
Commander Sinclair.

35:33.458 --> 35:35.083
'Please witness.'

35:38.250 --> 35:39.917
I name Thomas..

35:41.083 --> 35:44.375
...heir and successor.

35:46.750 --> 35:49.083
Everything I have.

35:49.167 --> 35:51.292
I witness this last testament.

35:58.167 --> 36:00.000
I see it, Thomas.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.250
The Grail!

36:17.292 --> 36:18.958
Aldous?

36:34.500 --> 36:36.917
We've confiscated
the fake encounter suit.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.167
It's a pretty close match
to your own

36:39.250 --> 36:40.792
at least from the outside.

36:41.375 --> 36:42.583
Why?

36:42.667 --> 36:44.667
Deuce wanted people to think
that he had the Vorlons

36:44.750 --> 36:46.083
working for him.

36:46.167 --> 36:49.583
Figured it would add to his
image and intimidate people.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.750
Why?

36:51.833 --> 36:55.792
Well, after all, no one knows
exactly what you look like.

36:55.875 --> 36:59.833
That makes some people
a little nervous.

37:00.833 --> 37:02.042
Good.

37:02.125 --> 37:04.458
(man on PA)
'Starliner Vancori now arriving'

37:04.542 --> 37:06.583
'in docking area Theta 5.'

37:07.750 --> 37:10.875
[speaking in foreign language]

37:16.208 --> 37:20.167
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- You shouldn't be.

37:20.250 --> 37:23.042
After all, I'm
not surprised to see you here.

37:24.250 --> 37:25.958
Just felt like
someone should be.

37:28.958 --> 37:32.125
It's a hard thing
to live your life searching

37:32.208 --> 37:34.125
for something
and never find it.

37:34.208 --> 37:38.083
Are you speaking of Aldous
or someone else?

37:42.750 --> 37:44.417
Aldous.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.792
But there you're wrong.

37:47.875 --> 37:49.917
He found what
he was looking for.

37:51.042 --> 37:52.917
What we're all looking for.

37:54.250 --> 37:55.292
A reason.

37:56.250 --> 37:57.375
For what?

37:59.042 --> 38:00.500
Everything, commander.

38:02.625 --> 38:03.958
Everything.

38:08.917 --> 38:10.708
Commander.

38:10.792 --> 38:12.000
Ambassador.

38:17.458 --> 38:20.583
Treat it gently, boys.
Treat it gently.

38:20.667 --> 38:23.750
[instrumental music]

38:32.625 --> 38:35.292
I thought Jinxo was supposed
to be here to see him

38:35.375 --> 38:36.583
you know, home.

38:37.708 --> 38:39.292
I haven't seen him.

38:39.375 --> 38:41.542
Yeah, well, it figures.

38:41.625 --> 38:44.542
Jinxo's not the type
to keep promises.

38:44.625 --> 38:48.458
(man on PA)
'Transport Marie Celeste will be
departing in ten minutes.'

38:48.542 --> 38:51.333
'Will all passengers
please board now?'

38:53.125 --> 38:56.083
[speaking in foreign language]

39:03.750 --> 39:08.042
Put this on the ground
where he rests and crush it.

39:11.625 --> 39:13.583
Here.

39:13.667 --> 39:16.333
It will glow each night
for a hundred years.

39:17.833 --> 39:21.542
It is our way
with all true seekers.

39:24.208 --> 39:26.042
Thank you. I will.

39:39.708 --> 39:41.875
Good luck.

39:41.958 --> 39:43.625
For what it's worth,
I hope you find it.

39:52.375 --> 39:54.375
Hey.

39:54.458 --> 39:55.625
Take care, Jinxo.

39:57.042 --> 39:58.375
Thomas.

40:02.750 --> 40:04.125
My name..

40:05.208 --> 40:06.542
...is Thomas.

40:13.542 --> 40:15.583
(Londo)
'Are you sure it's dead?'

40:15.667 --> 40:18.125
I'm positive.
It's dead as a rock.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.667
I saw it with my own eyes.

40:22.875 --> 40:24.792
How do you know
it's not just resting?

40:25.750 --> 40:27.000
Feeders are sneaky, you know.

40:27.083 --> 40:29.125
Londo, trust me.

40:38.750 --> 40:40.500
[chuckles]
Well..

40:41.583 --> 40:43.250
There you are, Vir.

40:43.333 --> 40:46.542
I told you there was nothing
to worry about.

40:46.625 --> 40:49.667
He's young. Sometimes he panics.
You know how it is.

40:51.708 --> 40:54.958
- Where is it?
- The doc's dissecting it.

40:55.042 --> 40:57.917
Wants to try and figure out
how it can move so fast.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.625
He's learning all kinds
of things about it.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.667
- Such as?
- 'Well..'

41:01.750 --> 41:04.708
When they're about to attack,
they get quiet.

41:04.792 --> 41:07.667
So the key is, as long as
you can hear them

41:07.750 --> 41:11.833
as long as there's noise around,
you're safe.

41:11.917 --> 41:13.375
But if you ever hear nothing..

41:15.125 --> 41:16.250
...worry.

41:25.375 --> 41:26.833
(Vir)
'That's interesting.'

41:27.750 --> 41:29.792
That's very interesting.

41:31.292 --> 41:32.625
[sighs]

41:34.292 --> 41:37.167
It's awfully quiet out here,
isn't it, ambassador?

41:41.042 --> 41:43.042
Ambassador?

41:43.125 --> 41:46.167
Londo! Open the door, Londo!

41:46.250 --> 41:48.708
Ambassador, it's not funny.
Open the door, Londo!

41:53.500 --> 41:56.375
There he goes. Jinx..

41:56.458 --> 41:59.417
- Thomas.
- Mm-hmm.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.708
You never did tell me what you
thought about that curse?

42:02.333 --> 42:03.583
What curse?

42:03.667 --> 42:05.875
You know, that bit about
if he leaves Babylon 5

42:05.958 --> 42:07.292
the same thing that happened

42:07.375 --> 42:10.417
to Babylons 1, 2, 3 and 4
would happen to us.

42:10.500 --> 42:13.083
Oh, that curse, you're not
taking it seriously, are you?

42:13.167 --> 42:16.542
Me? No, of course not. You?

42:16.625 --> 42:18.042
Nah.

42:18.125 --> 42:20.083
So how long
until he hits jump?

42:20.875 --> 42:23.625
Oh, right about..

42:24.667 --> 42:25.708
...now!

42:25.792 --> 42:28.583
[instrumental music]

42:33.500 --> 42:34.542
No boom?

42:36.375 --> 42:37.375
No boom.

42:37.458 --> 42:40.333
No boom today, boom tomorrow.

42:40.417 --> 42:42.125
There's always a boom tomorrow.

42:44.708 --> 42:46.333
What? Look,
somebody's gotta have

42:46.417 --> 42:48.792
some damn perspective
around here.

42:48.875 --> 42:52.583
Boom. Sooner or later, boom!

43:07.458 --> 43:09.792
