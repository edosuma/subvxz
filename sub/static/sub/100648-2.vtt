I made you something.

It's literally
nail polish remover,

00:09.748 --> 00:11.402
hydrogen peroxide,
and bleach.

00:11.446 --> 00:12.795
- She's
a terrible human being,

00:12.838 --> 00:14.797
and she thinks,
because she lives

00:14.840 --> 00:17.539

00:17.582 --> 00:20.324
Be good, okay?

00:20.368 --> 00:22.283
- Maybe the man
just needed a greeting card.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.502
- Throw it on.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.113
- Thanks again
for working your magic.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.505
- I wish I could do more.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.464
I murdered the kids' dad,
all right?

00:29.507 --> 00:31.161
- Marcus' dad--
he sets us up.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.250
- What if he doesn't come back?
- How much?

00:33.294 --> 00:35.078
- I'm not taking your money.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.428
- Can we not use the phrase
"a friend."

00:37.472 --> 00:38.342

04:44.849 --> 04:48.026
- And--and we're really doing
great work.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.682
- Well, I guess we have
a lot to celebrate.

04:51.726 --> 04:55.120
- And Dr. Cohen mentioned
that you could possibly play

04:55.164 --> 04:57.688
a role in our healing.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.386
- Ew.

04:59.429 --> 05:02.693
- Well, that's not really
what he said exactly.

05:02.737 --> 05:03.999
- Well, honey, he did say

05:04.042 --> 05:05.783
that she's the reason
that you slipped up.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.568
- Excuse me.

in the spirit of Ben--

05:13.313 --> 05:15.706
What else did, uh,
Dr. Cohen say?

05:15.750 --> 05:18.361
- What if we just table
this debate, huh?

05:18.405 --> 05:22.757
- Well, he said
that you're a tiny bit...

05:22.800 --> 05:25.020
broken.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.022
- Wow.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.285
- And a little bit lost.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.635
- Wow.
- Oh, God.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.985
- And that you are trying
to fix yourself

05:34.029 --> 05:37.772
by using my husband's...

05:37.815 --> 05:40.383
you know...

05:40.427 --> 05:42.385
And--and that it's just
kind of, like,

05:42.429 --> 05:44.909
this dysfunctional pattern,

05:44.953 --> 05:47.085
and it is going to
keep repeating itself

05:47.129 --> 05:49.784
until we all...

05:49.827 --> 05:53.091
figure this out.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.703
- It's deep stuff.

05:55.746 --> 05:57.313
- Mm.
- Yeah.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.795
- Yeah.
- What's your take, Gregg?

06:00.838 --> 06:04.799
- Um, just
that if you would like

06:04.842 --> 06:07.192
to talk with him

06:07.236 --> 06:09.107
that we would cover it.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.805
- I have his card.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.504
Here.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.594
- Your Dante's Inferno.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.703
- You sure?

06:39.747 --> 06:41.444
- We got to pay electric.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.185
- What about our phone?

06:44.360 --> 06:46.275
Send the check
for phone to water.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.972
Send the water to phone.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.063
- They see we had
good intentions.

06:52.107 --> 06:55.110
- Yeah, take 'em at least
a couple weeks to sort out.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.547
- And we still take showers.

06:57.591 --> 07:00.115
- Yeah, well, not Li'l Money.

07:00.158 --> 07:03.335
- Truly, he smells like
hamsters and burps.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.428
- I hate how good we are
at this.

07:08.471 --> 07:11.648
- I know.
Bill roulette.

07:11.692 --> 07:14.259
Hey, still works.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.960
- Hey, Darryl.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.445
When?

07:28.622 --> 07:31.102
- What do you mean
by "helping"?

07:31.146 --> 07:33.191
- Pointing out everything
that I'm doing wrong.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.106
-  Dog,
I've been on that for years.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.544
- Oh, she's more specific...

07:37.587 --> 07:40.024
Like where I keep
my trash bags,

07:40.068 --> 07:41.939
what I feed my kids,

07:41.983 --> 07:44.681
the way I wear my "rouge,"
as she puts it.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.857
- Too much, right?

07:50.513 --> 07:51.949
- Too little.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.908
- Hmm.

07:53.951 --> 07:57.651
- Hey, uh, this hot dog
tastes weird.

07:57.694 --> 08:01.524
- It's been spinning under
a light bulb for three days.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.308
- I need a refund.

08:03.352 --> 08:06.094
- You bought gas station meat.
Make better choices.

08:06.137 --> 08:08.357
- Hey, can I talk
to your manager?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.054
- Ooh.

08:19.063 --> 08:21.631
Just kick her ass to the curb.

08:21.675 --> 08:25.200
- She's cleaning
and doing the laundry.

08:25.243 --> 08:28.333
She ironed Dean's underwear.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.643
It's Ruby.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.515
Hey, lady.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.001
Do you guys sell flowers?

08:47.222 --> 08:48.571
- Jesus.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.313
- Yeah.

08:51.356 --> 08:55.665
- What is up with the
teddy bears at these things?

08:55.709 --> 08:58.625
I just mean...
they were adults.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.631
Everybody go to the same Kroger
to get flowers?

09:04.674 --> 09:06.371
- Can you not?

09:06.415 --> 09:08.112
- I'm just saying.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.114
- The man is dead, okay?

09:12.813 --> 09:15.206
- He did try to frame Stan.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.730
- Annie.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.472
- And lock us up.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.126
- He lost his life.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.607
- Okay.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.095
- That's not how that works.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.972
- You all right?

09:44.540 --> 09:46.586
- It is really weird.

10:07.563 --> 10:09.609
- Guess we're back in business.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.362
- Here's what we do.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.538
- Little help here?

10:26.582 --> 10:29.933
- We print 20 mil, one big run,
buy a giant super yacht.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.501
- Can I put
my mother-in-law on it?

10:32.544 --> 10:34.068
Round-the-world cruise?

10:34.111 --> 10:36.113
- Round and round
and then round again.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.115
No, because we sell it

10:38.159 --> 10:40.161
for a fleet of private jets--

10:40.204 --> 10:41.249
money washed.

10:41.292 --> 10:42.946
Boom.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.861
- What do we do with jets?

10:44.905 --> 10:46.036
- Sell 'em to the Saudis.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.385
Boom.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.866
- Stop saying "boom."
- Um, and we need that.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.477
- Fine.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.523
How would you wash
the money?

10:56.003 --> 10:58.135

10:58.179 --> 10:59.659
- She means gang friend.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.704
- Yeah, I connected those dots.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.490
- He outsourced.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.928
- Yeah, we did that, and we got
banned from Costco for life.

11:07.971 --> 11:11.671
- Literally, I grocery shop
at the dollar store.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.325
- Okay...

11:14.369 --> 11:17.328
what if we didn't use
people like us?

11:20.244 --> 11:22.682
- You mean like
people like him?

11:22.725 --> 11:24.074
- Yeah.

11:24.118 --> 11:27.338
- Where do we find
those people?

11:30.428 --> 11:32.996
- Hey, how was soccer?

11:33.040 --> 11:35.216
- I got to play goalie.

11:35.259 --> 11:38.349
- I thought Marcus was goalie.
- He didn't come today.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.658
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

11:44.660 --> 11:48.751
- Your rouge is just lovely.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.405
- Free sample.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.407
- Oh, what about mine, Judith?

11:52.450 --> 11:54.757
- Please, you've got youth.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.281
- Beth, are you home
for dinner,

11:57.325 --> 11:58.674
or will you be
at the card shop?

11:58.718 --> 12:01.546
- It's not just cards, Judith.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.070
They have gifts and--

12:03.113 --> 12:05.246
- You sold my clock?

12:06.595 --> 12:07.988
My ancestors brought that

12:08.031 --> 12:10.207
across the country
in a covered wagon.

12:10.251 --> 12:14.298
- Well, it's going back across
to Phil Hanson in a box truck.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.475
- Well, it's your wedding gift.

12:17.519 --> 12:20.261
I'll start the stroganoff.

12:24.178 --> 12:27.137
- I mean,
her rouge is on point.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.226
- I hate you both.

12:32.621 --> 12:35.406
- See you, Dean.
- Yeah, have a good one.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.452
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.430
- Hey, you.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.345
How do you like my fish?

13:01.389 --> 13:02.825
- Can't wait to catch my own.

13:02.869 --> 13:06.568
I just wish I knew how
to get my sales up, you know?

13:06.611 --> 13:09.005
- I got to let you in
on something, Dean.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.268
It'll be our secret.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.444
No one needs a hot tub.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.186
Okay.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.319
Well, how'd you get all those?

13:18.362 --> 13:20.756
- Landscapers,
contractors, realtors.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.758
It's a relationship game.

13:24.194 --> 13:27.937
I'll tell you, it sucks to be
the new kid at school.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.373
- Why don't I introduce you?

13:29.417 --> 13:31.027
- Seriously?

13:31.071 --> 13:33.682
- Come to dinner Thursday.
I'm meeting some developers.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.599
- Thanks.

13:38.687 --> 13:41.472
I'll head back.
Thank you.

13:43.692 --> 13:47.130
- How is it being
a mental patient?

13:47.174 --> 13:49.698
- It's okay.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.483
- What's your damage?

13:52.527 --> 13:55.878
- My parents
are getting a divorce.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.054
- What's that
got to do with you?

14:00.317 --> 14:02.363
- They're my parents.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.887
- Yeah, so, like,
why aren't they here?

14:04.931 --> 14:06.367
- I don't know.

14:09.239 --> 14:12.329
- You do drugs?

14:12.373 --> 14:15.028
- No.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.465
- You got a girlfriend?

14:17.508 --> 14:20.076
- There's a girl
I sort of like.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.904
- Well, she like you back?

14:21.948 --> 14:24.907
- She sits next to me
on the bus.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.517
- You're fine.

14:28.563 --> 14:29.999
- Hey, come on in, Tim.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.045
- Actually, one sec.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.829
This'll just take a sec.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.397
Real quick, Tim.
Here we go.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.399
Yeah.
- Okay.

14:38.442 --> 14:41.750
- What's Otsego University?

14:41.793 --> 14:44.927
- A nationally
accredited college.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.537
- Where's the campus?

14:46.581 --> 14:48.931
- Online.
- Bingo.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.715
- Well, your country's
quite stingy with visas.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.717
- Oh, so you're illegal.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.328
- Are you from the board?

14:54.371 --> 14:56.547
- You know, you might want to
lay down for this, Dr. Cohen...

14:56.591 --> 14:57.897
- No one really does that.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.900
- Because I am not lost,
I'm not broken,

15:00.943 --> 15:02.727
and I am certainly
not the reason

15:02.771 --> 15:04.555
that Gregory
cheated on his wife.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.383
You hear me?
- Loud and clear.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.645
Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.473
Because I'm about to deliver
some straight talk

15:09.517 --> 15:11.258
that's gonna help you
render your verdict

15:11.301 --> 15:12.563
or whatever it is
you people call it.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.348
- We call it a diagnosis.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.132
- He came to me, okay?

15:16.176 --> 15:19.962
He came to me because
that marriage is a joke.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.659
Mm-hmm, yeah.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.618
So it's not really my fault
that he got tired of boning

15:23.661 --> 15:25.620
an ice queen whose idea
of getting wild

15:25.663 --> 15:27.230
is leaving her bra on
for a quickie.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.406
- Oh, man, I mean,
who'd want to tap that?

15:29.450 --> 15:31.060
- Well, not her husband,

15:31.104 --> 15:33.628
especially not after being
locked up in a McMansion

15:33.671 --> 15:35.804
where you can't even choose
your own outfits,

15:35.847 --> 15:37.588
or, God forbid,
you try to talk about something

15:37.632 --> 15:39.416
other than ways
to jack up your face

15:39.460 --> 15:41.157
with lip fillers
and butt cement.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.811
- Wow.
- Yeah.

15:42.854 --> 15:45.248
- Yeah, it sounds like
they've got you all wrong.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.990
- Yes, yes.

15:48.034 --> 15:51.776
Now, what are you
gonna do about it, Otsego?

15:51.820 --> 15:54.344
Oh, uh, I don't need
a prescription, okay?

15:54.388 --> 15:55.998
- Oh, no, that's fine.
That's fine.

15:56.042 --> 16:00.307
Um...here's who
you're looking for, I think--

16:00.350 --> 16:03.005
Dr. Eli Cohen.

16:03.049 --> 16:06.095
I'm Josh Cohen.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.532
I work with kids.

16:11.709 --> 16:15.235
Yeah, um, Eli's upstairs
in a suite.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.586
- Oh.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.155
- You'll like him.
He went to a real college.

16:23.939 --> 16:27.290
- Well, thank you
for listening.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.683
- On the house.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.077
- That's so nice.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.952
- Do you mind sending Tim in?
- No, not at all.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.347
- Thanks.
-  I'll just...

16:40.390 --> 16:42.001
Oh, Tim?

16:42.044 --> 16:45.047
- No, leave it open.
Yeah.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.744
- "Coal black"?

16:46.788 --> 16:49.660
Now, how's that different
from coal gray and ink black?

16:49.704 --> 16:51.749
- Hold it to the light.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.838
I mean, where is this guy?

16:53.882 --> 16:55.666
- Why can't they just make
blackblack?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.668
- Is anyone working?
- You know, funeral black.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.627
You know, say exactly what
you need it for.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.978
- Oh, okay, I see.
It's like that.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.806
All right,
we're out of here.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.460
- I need to buy a suit, Ruby.

17:06.503 --> 17:09.028
- You got to go to this thing?
The man tried to put you away.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.247
- Okay, I'm going
for the families.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.206
- Be right with you, folks.

17:13.249 --> 17:14.555
- Oh, really?

17:14.598 --> 17:16.296
- Okay, okay, calm down, chief.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.428
- I mean, the time to be
right with us is long gone.

17:18.472 --> 17:19.647
- Babe, not now.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.475
- How we doing over here?

17:21.518 --> 17:22.650
- We were better
before you started

17:22.693 --> 17:23.999
Snapchatting your bestie.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.914
- I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you.

17:25.957 --> 17:30.614
- And that, Brian,
is exactly the problem.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.884
- Yeah, so do you guys,
uh, validate

17:39.928 --> 17:41.538
even if you
don't buy anything?

17:41.582 --> 17:43.671
- Let's go, Stanley!

17:45.064 --> 17:47.066
- Hey, I'm just checking in.

17:47.109 --> 17:50.199
Uh, Jane said that Marcus
wasn't at soccer today,

17:50.243 --> 17:52.288
so, um...

17:52.332 --> 17:54.421
I hope he doesn't have that bug
that's going around.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.771
Danny had it last week.
It's really brutal.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.947
I'm waiting for it to take out
the rest of us.

17:58.990 --> 18:02.733
Um, anyway, uh, yeah,
just call me back.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.171
I hope you guys are okay.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.695
- Hey, how much, uh--how much
cash do you have on you?

18:07.738 --> 18:09.436
- Why?

18:09.479 --> 18:11.960
- We need to tip
the movers pretty big.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.527
- Why?

18:13.570 --> 18:16.573
- Well, I kind of--I kind of
stepped in it with one of them.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.053
- Which one?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.750
- The guy with the tat
with the girl on it--

18:19.794 --> 18:22.405
the one with super detail
with the boobs, the nipple,

18:22.449 --> 18:23.667
and the camel toe.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.147
- All right.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.109
What did you say?

18:30.152 --> 18:31.762
- I made some stupid joke
about most movers

18:31.806 --> 18:33.068
coming straight
out of prison.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.591
I wasn't even talking
about those guys.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.506
- Okay, so?

18:36.550 --> 18:38.247
- So they're straight
out of prison,

18:38.291 --> 18:40.597
and the lead guy
with the tattoo thingy,

18:40.641 --> 18:42.773
his rap sheet reads
like a CVS receipt.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.514
He's telling me
like he's proud--

18:44.558 --> 18:47.474
armed robbery,
forced entry, kidnapping,

18:47.517 --> 18:49.476
something-class two
with animals.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.869
We're talking
full-on criminal, Beth.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.372
- Lemonade?

19:24.554 --> 19:26.817
- We have an employee, okay?

19:26.861 --> 19:29.864
He's gonna wash
exactly like we did, except...

19:29.907 --> 19:31.518
- Where did this guy
go to prison?

19:31.561 --> 19:33.694
- I don't know.
He didn't have a résumé.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.957
- Yeah, but is he
more Martha Stewart

19:36.000 --> 19:37.263
or Suge Knight?

19:37.306 --> 19:39.178
- I don't think he plays golf.

19:39.221 --> 19:43.007
- Oh, great.
So we're rape bait.

19:43.051 --> 19:46.837
- Well, can't get all of us.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.840
I mean, not all at once.

19:49.884 --> 19:52.843
- Great.
So he gets me while you watch?

19:52.887 --> 19:54.628
- No, we run for help.

19:54.671 --> 19:58.501
- The point is, he's gonna wash
in ways that we can't.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.851
- So how's he gonna do it?

20:00.895 --> 20:04.028
- Not Costco.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.561
- How much are these?

20:14.604 --> 20:16.040
- $9.95.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.836
- 50/50, right?

20:30.054 --> 20:32.361
- What?
No.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.929
- What we agreed on.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.887
- We said ten.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.715
- I meant 50.

20:39.934 --> 20:43.067
- Uh, Beth.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.818
- 48 hours.

21:14.229 --> 21:17.450
- Well, no one got raped.
- Sort of.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.505
- Ben's at a friend's.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.986
- I-I came for you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.467
- It came out wrong, okay?
- Oh, which part--

21:34.510 --> 21:36.295
the needy and slutty...

21:36.338 --> 21:38.297
Or the lost and broken?

21:38.340 --> 21:40.168
- She's still hurt
and, like, super mad.

21:40.211 --> 21:41.430
- That I get.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.519
- It's just her way
of processing it, okay?

21:43.563 --> 21:45.826
- What I don't understand is
how you could possibly think

21:45.869 --> 21:48.437
that your penis wasn't
equally at fault here, Gregg.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.047
- What do you want
me to do, Annie?

21:50.091 --> 21:53.050
- Stand up for me for once.
- You didn't want me.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.530
- You had a baby with her.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.837
- Yeah, and now that's why
I got to try and fix it.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.665
- I feel bad for you.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.623
- Okay.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.799
- You know, you could see
every shrink on the planet,

22:02.843 --> 22:04.888
and you'd still
never sack up.

22:04.932 --> 22:06.803
- Nice.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.414
- Good luck
on your spiritual journey.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.111
- Got it.

22:10.154 --> 22:12.113
- Find the light, Gregory.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.028
- You know what?

22:14.071 --> 22:16.160
You're lucky.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.684
- Why's that?

22:17.727 --> 22:22.384
- Because it must be nice
being just so perfect.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.657
all:
God is great. God is good.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.399
By His blessings, we are fed.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.271
Give us, Lord, our daily bread.

22:40.315 --> 22:41.490
- Amen.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.057
- Mom.
- Hi, Mommy.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.407
- I thought you'd be selling
your cards tonight.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.061
- Not just cards, Judith.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.802
- Let me get you a seat.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.894
- So we're praying
at dinner now?

22:53.937 --> 22:56.418
- Yeah, Mom thought
it would be fun.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.377
- Hmm.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.639
How'd it go today?

22:59.682 --> 23:01.641
- He sold another Boland.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.033
- That's not
what they're called, Mom.

23:03.077 --> 23:06.254
- Tell that to
the Jacuzzi family.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.951
- Are we going to be famous?

23:07.995 --> 23:11.868
- Ooh, when Daddy has his own
spa named after him, yes.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.870
- We're a long way
from that, dear.

23:13.914 --> 23:16.307
There you go.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.527
- Mommy's in the baby chair.

23:18.571 --> 23:21.574
- What do you call
a cow who's masturbating?

23:21.617 --> 23:24.446
Beef stroganoff.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.580
Get it?
It's a cow that's, you know...

23:27.623 --> 23:29.843
- Kenneth Irving Boland.

23:29.886 --> 23:33.803
- Kenny, why don't you go
do your homework?

23:33.847 --> 23:35.544
- He needs to finish
his dinner.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.900
- So the Jacuzzis
were actually brothers.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.859
- Do you want
to be finished, KB?

23:45.902 --> 23:48.078
- Yeah.
- Go play video games.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.341
- They've had plenty
of screen time.

23:50.385 --> 23:53.127
- And throw in some YouTube.

23:59.525 --> 24:00.961
- There were seven of 'em,

24:01.004 --> 24:03.354
and they started out
making airplane propellers.

24:04.791 --> 24:08.142
- Got to be in the clean-plate
club to get dessert.

24:16.890 --> 24:21.721
- One of 'em died
in a plane crash, and...

24:21.764 --> 24:23.636
they decided to scrap it

24:23.679 --> 24:26.595
and--and just focus
on impellers

24:26.639 --> 24:28.118
and hydrodynamics instead.

24:28.162 --> 24:30.294
- You can have
as much dessert as you want.

24:30.338 --> 24:33.080
- All I know is there are
plenty of starving children

24:33.123 --> 24:35.865
in Africa that would love
to have this food.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.565
- Ship it to 'em.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.523
Come on, let's go crush
some brownies.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.786
- I'm in the clean-plate club!
- Me too!

24:43.830 --> 24:47.442
- I want brownies!

24:47.486 --> 24:49.879
- I get the first on!

24:54.884 --> 24:56.756
And that's how they got

24:56.799 --> 24:59.106
in the whirlpool game.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.511
- I appreciate
you helping us out.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.995
- Did Dean ever tell you
I worked?

25:20.257 --> 25:21.781
- No.

25:21.824 --> 25:25.001
- After he was born,

25:25.045 --> 25:28.831
I was sitting on a bag
of frozen peas,

25:28.875 --> 25:31.355
squirting water down there
so I could tinkle

25:31.399 --> 25:33.836
without my parts catching fire.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.621
- Nobody tells you
what it's like.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.361
- That you'll come out
all stitched back together

25:37.405 --> 25:38.537
like Humpty Dumpty.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.408
- We'd never have kids.

25:40.451 --> 25:43.716
- And everyone's fawning
over this perfect baby boy,

25:43.759 --> 25:46.109
while I'm just...

25:48.111 --> 25:50.549
Nothing...

25:50.592 --> 25:55.031
empty,
flesh and hormones over ice.

26:01.081 --> 26:04.606
- I had postpartum
after Jane.

26:04.650 --> 26:07.696
- Back then, they called it
"a nervous condition."

26:07.740 --> 26:09.655
Judith.

26:09.698 --> 26:13.093
- So I became a shopgirl.

26:13.136 --> 26:15.748
Got dressed up, dropped
the baby with a neighbor,

26:15.791 --> 26:18.446
took the bus downtown,
and you know what?

26:18.489 --> 26:20.491
I felt like a person again...

26:20.535 --> 26:23.451
with a purpose.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.888
- Why'd you stop?

26:25.932 --> 26:28.195
- I made a quarter
of what John made,

26:28.238 --> 26:32.242
and my son was being raised
by wolves.

26:32.286 --> 26:36.290
Dean's boss called him
management material.

26:38.945 --> 26:41.904
- Your happiness
was important, too.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.908
- How much
does the card shop pay?

26:45.952 --> 26:48.171
- You shouldn't have quit.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.086
- And you should be home
for dinner

26:50.130 --> 26:53.612
if you don't want
the kids saying grace.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.484
What a lie, huh?

26:56.527 --> 26:58.617
That we can have it all.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.848
- That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

27:12.892 --> 27:14.633
- It's no crazier
than saying "Jacuzzi."

27:14.676 --> 27:17.026
- Ooh, I slept funny.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.246
- I know something
that could work that right out.

27:19.289 --> 27:21.030
- All right.
- What's that?

27:21.074 --> 27:23.250
- Take a Boland.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.817
- Nice, steamy Boland.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.254
- Oh, a big, bubbling Boland.

27:27.297 --> 27:29.082
- Coming in off the ski slopes.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.213
- Rough day at work?

27:30.257 --> 27:31.824
- Grab your favorite magazine.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.086
- Pop out back.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.131
- Step into a foamy Boland.

27:35.175 --> 27:38.091
- Yeah!

27:38.134 --> 27:40.267
- Where is this guy?

27:40.310 --> 27:42.182
- I don't know.
I don't know if he's lost.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.445
- Text him.
- I just did.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.403
- What if he went
to the paper place?

27:46.447 --> 27:48.275
- I gave him the address.

27:48.318 --> 27:51.365
- What if he's not coming?

27:53.280 --> 27:55.412
- Yo.

27:55.456 --> 27:58.459
- Hi.
It's Beth.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.940
I'm just calling
for a quick ETA.

28:00.983 --> 28:03.290
- I'm not gonna make it.

28:03.333 --> 28:06.423
- Oh, uh...

28:06.467 --> 28:08.425
do you need
to reschedule?

28:08.469 --> 28:10.384
- No, I'm good.

28:13.169 --> 28:15.824
- But you owe us some money.

28:15.868 --> 28:18.218
- Yeah, I did some math,
and it works out

28:18.261 --> 28:21.221
way better for me
if I take 100%.

28:24.267 --> 28:25.878
- What?

28:27.357 --> 28:29.708
Hello?

28:31.535 --> 28:32.754
- Did he say "math" or "meth"?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.364
- Call him back.
- And do what?

28:34.408 --> 28:36.105
Say "please"?

28:38.934 --> 28:42.764
- You have reached
the voice mailbox of 313--

28:46.246 --> 28:48.117
- Let's do what he would do.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.815
- He would make him
eat a Glock.

28:49.858 --> 28:51.860
- Okay, let's do that.

28:51.904 --> 28:54.863
- Beth, you're not
a scary gangbanger

28:54.907 --> 28:56.169
with throat tats.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.127
You're a mom with
a Chinese symbol on your hip

28:58.171 --> 28:59.825
you got on Spring Break.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.827
- Wait, I thought
you got that lasered.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.176
- It is so expensive.

29:03.219 --> 29:05.787
- You are never gonna be him.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.833
So let's just suck it up,
print some more.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.399
- Are you serious?

29:09.443 --> 29:10.705
- We have the plates.
We have the press.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.621
- That last run cost us
a grand in ones.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.710
- We have to find
another career criminal.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.234
- What happens when that guy
decides to renegotiate?

29:18.278 --> 29:20.062
- Then we make more.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.934
- And then that guy?

29:21.977 --> 29:23.979
- We make more.

29:24.023 --> 29:26.329
- And then every criminal
in the city knows

29:26.373 --> 29:29.071
that we're a bunch of suckers.

29:29.115 --> 29:31.813
- Well, can't have it all.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.301
- I'm a pillar
of the community.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.651
I organize
the neighborhood watch.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.784
I'm on the PTA,
Chamber of Commerce.

29:45.827 --> 29:49.091
I post on Yelp,
Angie's List, Nextdoor.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.790
I am a den mother,
for God's sake.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.617
- Ma'am, again,
I apologize--

29:53.661 --> 29:55.532
- Yeah, well, that's not gonna
put the 500 bucks

29:55.576 --> 29:57.883
back in my son's piggy bank.

29:57.926 --> 30:00.407
Do you know how many lawns
he had to mow for that?

30:00.450 --> 30:04.237
- Now, is it possible...

30:04.280 --> 30:06.935
that he misplaced it?

30:06.979 --> 30:08.545
- Really?

30:08.589 --> 30:11.810
$500 goes missing
on the exact day

30:11.853 --> 30:14.900
that this guy
is loose in my house?

30:14.943 --> 30:16.945
- I didn't take
this bitch's money.

30:16.989 --> 30:19.469
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:19.513 --> 30:22.995
A lot of strong emotions here.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.779
- I just want my money.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.607
- You might want to be careful
about who you're coming at

30:26.650 --> 30:28.652
with all these
accusations.

30:28.696 --> 30:31.264
- No, I-I am sure
that we can work something out.

30:31.307 --> 30:34.615
- Or this bitch
could take it up

30:34.658 --> 30:36.051
with his parole officer.

30:37.748 --> 30:41.317
How many violations do you get
before they send you back?

30:48.107 --> 30:50.892
- We're gonna take
another good look around.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.894
- I'd appreciate that.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.256
- What's this?

31:07.300 --> 31:08.475
- Don't start.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.303
- I hope it's not
a coal black suit.

31:10.346 --> 31:13.175
- Yep, and I got
the pocket square, too.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.829
- Why would you go back there?

31:14.873 --> 31:17.397
- They're the only place
that does layaway.

31:20.661 --> 31:23.142
- How long did you wait?

31:23.185 --> 31:26.101
Please let me make my sandwich
- How long?

31:29.931 --> 31:30.932
- You're exhausting.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.500
- Maybe you need
to be more exhausting.

31:33.543 --> 31:34.675
- And what does that mean?

31:34.718 --> 31:36.329
- You're so used
to being disrespected,

31:36.372 --> 31:37.939
you don't even see it
happening anymore.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.506
- Babe, you go HAM
every time they seat us

31:39.549 --> 31:40.811
by a bathroom
in a restaurant.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.552
- Why should we sit
by the bathroom?

31:42.596 --> 31:44.598
- Somebody's got to.
- It's unappetizing.

31:44.641 --> 31:47.079
- Babe, ask them to move.
- I shouldn't have to.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.124
- And I should be able
to enjoy dinner with my family

31:49.168 --> 31:51.083
without feeling like the
whole world is out to get us.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.737
- So you just want to pretend
it's not happening?

32:01.789 --> 32:05.053
- I just want buying a suit
to be buying a suit.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.888
- They're UV protected,
maintenance-free.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.370
We can match the color
of any deck, any siding,

32:17.413 --> 32:18.893
no matter what, guaranteed.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.677
- Where have you been hiding
this one, Gayle?

32:20.721 --> 32:22.375
- Just my secret weapon.
- Oh.

32:22.418 --> 32:23.724
- Looking forward
to more, Dean.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.291
- Yes, sir.
- Drinks on us next time.

32:25.334 --> 32:28.076
- Next time we are drinking
to celebrate a big sale.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.209
- Bye, you guys, drive safe.

32:30.252 --> 32:32.994
All right?
- Thanks so much.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.953
- What did I tell you?

32:34.996 --> 32:36.911
I am serious.
You're a natural.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.000
- Oh, I had
a pretty good teacher.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.394
- Maybe it's about
making the right connection.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.006
- Oh, thanks, man.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.226
Oh, wait, I had the, uh--
I had the gray Buick.

32:47.269 --> 32:48.705
- Those are mine.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.974
This is gonna be fun, huh?

32:56.017 --> 32:57.453
- For sure.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.241
- Hey, it's me.

33:02.284 --> 33:04.417
I'm not trying to stalk you
or anything.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.332
I'm just a little worried.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.942
Um...

33:07.986 --> 33:10.031
I hope I'm crazy,
and you and Marcus

33:10.075 --> 33:13.252
are having fun somewhere.

33:15.123 --> 33:18.561
Um...

33:18.605 --> 33:22.087
call me or text me
or, um, whatever.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.393
- How is that your breakfast?

35:34.436 --> 35:35.916
- Savory sweet.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.222
- Disgusting.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.527
- It's like huevos rancheros.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.181
- Except no huevos.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.009
- And no rancheros.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.054
- I'm a grown-up.
I can eat whatever I want.

35:44.098 --> 35:45.578
Comprende?

35:48.102 --> 35:49.712
- So he just showed up
with all of it?

35:49.756 --> 35:51.366
- Minus his cut, yeah.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.194
- We should've kept his share.

35:53.238 --> 35:55.240
Show him who's boss.

35:55.283 --> 35:57.459
- Easy to say when
you're not in the dark backyard

35:57.503 --> 36:00.158
with him
and his big old meat hands.

36:00.201 --> 36:01.898
- So let's go divvy up.

36:01.942 --> 36:04.249
- Yeah,
I'm gonna buy Ben a pony.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.076
You know,
those really tiny ones?

36:06.120 --> 36:07.730
- Does he want a pony?

36:07.774 --> 36:09.863
- What kid doesn't want a pony?

36:09.906 --> 36:12.822
- Girl, you have bills.
- I mean with the extra.

36:12.866 --> 36:17.044
- Or instead of a pony...

36:17.087 --> 36:19.525
we take this profit,

36:19.568 --> 36:22.223
and we get more ones.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.094
- And then what?

36:25.357 --> 36:27.010
- We print more money.

36:27.054 --> 36:29.187
- And then what?

36:29.230 --> 36:30.666
- We make more.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.929
- Yeah?
And then what?

36:32.973 --> 36:35.236
- Whatever we want.
- Yeah.

36:37.673 --> 36:39.501
- I mean,
it's what he would do.

36:39.545 --> 36:40.937
Hmm?
- He wouldn't do that.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.243
- You're jealous.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.940
Here, you two can join
the syrup-on-your-face club.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.507
- Don't get it
anywhere near me.

36:45.551 --> 36:46.595
- Come on.

36:46.639 --> 36:47.857
- I don't want it
anywhere near me.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.119
- We're accepting new members.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.469
- Yikes.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.474
- Hey.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.954
- Hey.
How'd you do?

36:57.998 --> 36:59.869
- Well...

36:59.913 --> 37:02.263
Some dude gave me a 20
to park his E-Class out front.

37:02.307 --> 37:03.830
- Gross.
- Yeah.

37:03.873 --> 37:08.051
- I horked in his water bottle
and stole all his change.

37:08.095 --> 37:10.140
So how's my Nance?

37:10.184 --> 37:12.491
- She keeps saying my name
to prove she's cool with it.

37:12.534 --> 37:13.492
Hi, Ben.

37:13.535 --> 37:14.797
How was school today, Ben?

37:14.841 --> 37:16.277
- Would you like a boba, Ben?

37:16.321 --> 37:18.192
- Boba Ben, Ben, Ben, boba?

37:18.236 --> 37:19.759
- She's so woke.

37:19.802 --> 37:22.327
-  Yeah, ever since
she got therapized.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.503
- That whole thing
was so wrong.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.287
- You know who I think
needs a therapist?

37:26.331 --> 37:27.375
Therapists.

37:27.419 --> 37:28.811
- Jenny's mom's a therapist.

37:28.855 --> 37:31.988
- And she went to rehab
for Ritalin.

37:32.032 --> 37:33.642
- Why are they
up your butt anyway?

37:33.686 --> 37:35.427
You don't need a therapist.

37:35.470 --> 37:36.863
- Thank you.

37:36.906 --> 37:39.692
- You tell me everything.
I solve your problems.

37:42.042 --> 37:45.263
- I-I mean, not everything.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.658
- Good thing I'm free,
'cause you'd go broke.

37:56.230 --> 37:58.493
- So how's this supposed
to work, anyway?

37:58.537 --> 38:00.974
- Just talk about
what's bothering you.

38:01.017 --> 38:03.672
- Yeah, but
what do people usually say?

38:03.716 --> 38:05.021
- Well, most of my patients
are younger,

38:05.065 --> 38:07.241
so lots of complaints
about brushing teeth,

38:07.285 --> 38:10.288
going to bed early,
wanting more screen time.

38:12.855 --> 38:15.336
- This is stupid.
I'm gonna go.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.120
- Okay.

38:21.908 --> 38:23.953
- Aren't you
gonna try to stop me?

38:23.997 --> 38:26.129
- I can't help you
if you don't have any problems.

38:28.044 --> 38:29.916
- Got a problem
with your attitude.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.831
What else?

38:31.874 --> 38:35.443
- Well, this bean-bag chair
kind of smells like pee.

38:35.487 --> 38:37.271
- There is a reason for that.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.415
- What else?

38:58.423 --> 39:01.426
- Babe.
- Yeah?

39:01.469 --> 39:04.254
- Was I like this
when you met me?

39:04.298 --> 39:07.301
- No, you hid it better.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.173
- You should've
checked references.

39:10.217 --> 39:11.914
- Honestly,
I'm angry, too, babe,

39:11.958 --> 39:14.569
but you just can't live
in it all the time.

39:14.613 --> 39:17.224
- What if I found
a way to stop?

39:17.267 --> 39:20.967
- Oh, yeah, sure, there's, um,
yoga, meditations,

39:21.010 --> 39:23.578
church has got a bunch
of different fellowships.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.673
- What if it was something
you wouldn't like?

39:36.809 --> 39:38.114
But we wouldn't have to sit

39:38.158 --> 39:40.290
next to the bathroom
ever again?

39:45.818 --> 39:48.951
- I thought
we said never again.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.389
- You look real good
in that suit.

39:53.129 --> 39:54.392
- Nice.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.002
- Pass this down to Daddy.

39:56.045 --> 39:57.786
- Daddy gets the big piece.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.135
- There we go.
- Nice.

39:59.179 --> 40:00.485
- Here you go.

40:00.528 --> 40:03.488
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.446
- I was defrosting a casserole.

40:05.490 --> 40:06.708
- Oh, the kids wanted pizza.

40:06.752 --> 40:09.058
- Yeah, come, uh--
come sit down, have a slice.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.582
- Come on, guys, help me out.
- Pass it, come on, let's go.

40:10.625 --> 40:13.323
- I put you here next to Kenny.
Is pepperoni okay?

40:13.367 --> 40:14.586
- Uh-huh.

40:14.629 --> 40:15.978
- All right, team Boland,
check in.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.719
How's everyone's day?
Thank you.

40:19.112 --> 40:20.113
Oh, really?

40:20.156 --> 40:21.897
Nobody has anything
to say at all?

40:21.941 --> 40:23.638
- Ooh, I killed a frog
in science.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.118
- Oh, that's gnarly.

40:25.161 --> 40:28.817
- I finally made sense
of that pantry of yours.

40:28.861 --> 40:30.340
- I had a pretty good day.

40:30.384 --> 40:31.646
- Yeah?

40:31.690 --> 40:34.910
- I got an opportunity
to make some real money.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.782
They want to promote me
to manager.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.262
- No way.
Yay, Mommy.

40:39.306 --> 40:41.308
- Is that better than worker?
- Way better.

40:41.351 --> 40:43.658
I get salary. I get commission
on every event.

40:43.702 --> 40:45.181
That's awesome.

40:45.225 --> 40:46.531
- They're even talking
profit sharing.

40:46.574 --> 40:48.489
- What about the hours?

40:48.533 --> 40:50.709
- Well, that's the best part,
because we'll be able to afford

40:50.752 --> 40:54.190
help now and you don't have
to worry about us anymore.

40:54.234 --> 40:56.976
- That is incredible.
Congratulations.

40:57.019 --> 41:00.849
And, you guys, how about we say
thank you to Nana?

41:00.893 --> 41:02.068
- Thanks, Nana.
- Thank you, Nana.

41:02.111 --> 41:04.766
- We couldn't have done it
without you.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.514
Work.

41:13.558 --> 41:14.820
- Cheers.

41:14.863 --> 41:16.996
Thank you.

41:17.039 --> 41:20.652
- Oh, my God,
I was worried about you.

41:20.695 --> 41:22.784
And Marcus is okay?

41:25.091 --> 41:27.789
No, no, no, no, no,
I totally get it.

41:30.966 --> 41:32.707
Well, listen,
I've got your money,

41:32.751 --> 41:35.797
and it's, like, totally burning
a hole in my pocket.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.235
I know, but I'm not good
at this stuff.

41:40.933 --> 41:43.762
Hey, you want to get a drink
or something?

41:43.805 --> 41:46.939
Dean's mom is here, and it's,
like, this whole thing.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.723
You're gonna die.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.508
- Can I get you anything?

41:50.551 --> 41:51.987
- I'll wait for my friend.

41:59.778 --> 42:01.562
- She ain't coming.

42:11.267 --> 42:14.009
I think you might need
that drink, huh?
