00:34.816 --> 00:35.717
BAD NEWS.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.218
YEAH, IF IT'S ABOUT BEING
OUT OF MINI DONUTS,

00:37.286 --> 00:40.454
I'M AWARE,
AND I'M NOT HAPPY.

00:40.522 --> 00:43.691
NO, YOU KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO SHOW THOSE MODEL HOMES TODAY?

00:45.944 --> 00:48.213
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
IT FOR THE LAST 2 WEEKS

00:48.281 --> 00:51.549
SO I CAN FINALLY PROVE
MYSELF TO MR. KAUFMAN.

00:53.285 --> 00:54.853
MY BOSS?

00:54.920 --> 00:56.921
OK.

00:56.989 --> 00:58.089
ANYWAY,
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

00:58.157 --> 01:01.092
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET WITH
STEVE, OUR FINANCIAL ADVISER.

01:02.544 --> 01:04.762
DO YOU EVER LISTEN
TO ME WHEN I TALK?

01:04.830 --> 01:08.049
DO YOU? YOU'RE REALLY BORING,
I GOTTA TELL YOU.

01:08.116 --> 01:10.535
DOUG, I REALLY NEED YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.303
ALL RIGHT, I'LL
GIVE IT A WHIRL. GO.

01:15.141 --> 01:18.376
I NEED YOU TO TAKE
OUR TAX REFUND CHECK

01:18.444 --> 01:21.746
AND SIT WITH STEVE AND
TALK ABOUT INVESTMENTS.

01:21.814 --> 01:24.883
WOULDN'T I BE MORE USEFUL
DOING SOMETHING I'M GOOD AT,

01:24.950 --> 01:30.088
LIKE SODA SHOPPING
OR LYING DOWN?

01:30.156 --> 01:32.890
COME ON. I NEED YOU TO TAKE
AN INTEREST IN OUR FINANCES.

01:32.958 --> 01:34.926
NOW, THERE'S A BUNCH
OF INVESTMENTS HERE.

01:34.994 --> 01:37.529
I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING
YOU CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT, OK?

01:37.597 --> 01:39.331
TELL STEVE I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T MAKE IT.

01:39.398 --> 01:40.298
WHO'S STEVE?

01:40.366 --> 01:41.750
OUR FINANCIAL GUY.

01:41.817 --> 01:43.585
I'M KIDDING.
I'M JOKING AROUND.

01:43.652 --> 01:45.486
YOU WEREN'T JOKING,
WERE YOU?

01:45.554 --> 01:47.338
NO, I WASN'T.

01:54.563 --> 01:56.081
OH, I'M SORRY.

01:56.148 --> 01:57.915
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
SHOWING A MODEL HOME.

01:57.984 --> 01:59.451
NO, THIS IS IT.
COME ON IN.

01:59.518 --> 02:02.220
<i>THE KIDS AND I ARE JUST
WATCHING THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN.</i>

02:04.190 --> 02:07.809
IT'S RAUNCHY, BUT
DOGGONE, IT SURE IS FUNNY.

02:07.876 --> 02:10.695
CARRIE, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE.

02:10.762 --> 02:12.413
UH, MR. KAUFMAN.

02:12.481 --> 02:14.065
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

02:14.132 --> 02:18.370
THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL ACTORS
PRETENDING TO BE A FAMILY.

02:18.437 --> 02:20.305
OH, OK.

02:20.372 --> 02:21.639
QUESTION ANSWERED.

02:21.707 --> 02:23.741
IT'S CALLED HOME STAGING.

02:23.809 --> 02:26.645
WHEN POTENTIAL BUYERS SEE A
FAMILY LIVING IN THE HOUSE,

02:26.712 --> 02:29.514
IT HELPS THEM ENVISION
THEMSELVES LIVING HERE.

02:29.582 --> 02:32.834
I GOTTA TELL YOU, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A SUPER WEIRD IDEA.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.253
IT WAS MINE.

02:36.238 --> 02:38.022
EXCUSE ME, CARRIE.

02:39.157 --> 02:40.692
HELLO.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.461
OH, DAMN IT.

02:43.529 --> 02:46.064
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

02:46.131 --> 02:47.465
IT'S BAD NEWS.

02:47.533 --> 02:51.469
<i>OUR MOM ISN'T SHOWING UP.
SHE JUST BOOKED A C.S.I.</i>

02:51.537 --> 02:54.722
ALL RIGHT. WELL, SINGLE
DAD. NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

02:54.790 --> 02:58.409
NOTHING WRONG WITH THE
BREAKDOWN OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY?

02:58.477 --> 03:02.080
YOU KNOW, WE ARE REALLY
NOT HERE TODAY, ARE WE?

03:02.147 --> 03:03.464
CARRIE...

03:03.499 --> 03:04.916
YOU'VE GOTTA BE THE MOM.

03:04.983 --> 03:06.617
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

03:06.685 --> 03:08.386
I AM MUCH BETTER AT SELLING.

03:08.453 --> 03:12.857
BESIDES, I AM WAY TOO YOUNG TO BE
PLAYING SOMEONE WITH KIDS THAT AGE.

03:12.925 --> 03:15.159
I THINK YOU CAN
GET AWAY WITH IT.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.538
WEALTH BUILDING
ANNUITIES.

03:26.605 --> 03:28.540
THAT'S STUPID.

03:45.741 --> 03:46.591
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

03:46.658 --> 03:47.625
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:47.693 --> 03:48.793
HE'S SAVING MY PLACE.

03:48.860 --> 03:51.529
HEY, NO BACK CUTSIES.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

03:51.597 --> 03:53.064
BELIEVE THIS GUY?

03:53.132 --> 03:54.249
UNBELIEVABLE.

03:54.316 --> 03:55.050
YEAH.

03:55.117 --> 03:56.768
YEAH, CAN I GET
AN ESKIMO PIE

03:56.835 --> 03:59.070
AND AN ORANGE PUSH POP?

04:00.372 --> 04:01.873
I LIKE THE PUSH POP.

04:01.940 --> 04:03.508
YOU GOTTA WORK TO GET IT.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.910
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO
PUT IN THE TIME, BUT NOT THIS GUY.

04:05.978 --> 04:08.562
HURRAY FOR YOU.
THAT'S 2.50.

04:10.182 --> 04:12.483
YOU REALLY, UH,
YOU REALLY SELLING THIS TRUCK?

04:12.551 --> 04:15.586
SURE AM.
MY NAME'S CAL.

04:15.654 --> 04:17.505
WOULD YOU, UH...

04:17.572 --> 04:21.341
WOULD YOU SAY
THIS IS A, UH...

04:21.410 --> 04:23.778
GOOD INVESTMENT?

04:23.845 --> 04:26.631
GOOD ENOUGH TO BUY ME
A CONDO IN FLORIDA.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.967
HUH.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.544
COME ON.
I HAD A REALLY HARD DAY.

04:40.612 --> 04:42.546
JUST KEEP YOUR
EYES CLOSED. COME ON.

04:42.614 --> 04:44.382
ALL RIGHT, GET READY.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.383
OK.

04:45.451 --> 04:49.103
AND OPEN 'EM.
TA-DA!

04:53.441 --> 04:56.978
PLEASE TELL ME THERE'S AN ICE
CREAM MAN USING OUR BATHROOM.

04:57.045 --> 04:59.446
OH, THERE'S
AN ICE CREAM MAN,

04:59.514 --> 05:01.115
BUT HE'S NOT USING
OUR BATHROOM.

05:02.868 --> 05:04.685
HE'S STANDING
RIGHT HERE.

05:04.753 --> 05:06.687
WHERE I AM.
WHAT I'M SAYING,

05:06.755 --> 05:08.956
I'M THE ICE CREAM MAN.
I AM.

05:09.024 --> 05:10.174
WHAT?

05:10.242 --> 05:12.543
I TOOK OUR REFUND CHECK
AND I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK.

05:12.611 --> 05:15.880
DOUG, YOU THREW AWAY $3,000.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.049
YOU TOLD ME TO INVEST IN
SOMETHING I'D BE EXCITED ABOUT.

05:18.116 --> 05:19.718
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
I'M EXCITED.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.936
YEAH, I BET
YOU ARE EXCITED.

05:22.004 --> 05:24.505
HOW MUCH OF IT
DID YOU EAT ALREADY?

05:24.572 --> 05:26.457
NONE, OK?

05:26.525 --> 05:27.791
THAT'S RULE ONE
IN THE ICE CREAM GAME.

05:27.859 --> 05:29.394
YOU DON'T GET HIGH
ON YOUR OWN SUPPLY.

05:32.264 --> 05:35.299
OH, MY GOD. I THINK
IT'S REALLY GONNA HAPPEN.

05:35.367 --> 05:37.952
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA
KILL YOU THIS TIME.

05:38.020 --> 05:40.538
WOULD YOU STOP? I THOUGHT
THIS OUT, BELIEVE ME.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.674
I GET DONE WITH
MY I.P.S. ROUTE AT 4:00,

05:42.742 --> 05:45.559
AND THEN I HIT THE
STREETS IN THIS BAD BOY.

05:45.627 --> 05:48.395
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE ICE CREAM BUSINESS.

05:48.463 --> 05:50.382
I'M ON TOP OF IT.
I LOOKED AT HIS BOOKS.

05:50.449 --> 05:53.117
I SAW HIS
PROFIT MARGIN. HUH?

05:53.185 --> 05:55.103
I GOT A LIST
OF ALL HIS SUPPLIERS.

05:55.170 --> 05:56.270
IT'S GONNA WORK.

05:56.338 --> 05:57.739
YES.
REALLY?

05:57.806 --> 05:58.706
CARRIE, I'M TELLING YOU,

05:58.774 --> 06:00.375
YOU'RE GONNA BE
PROUD OF ME. I SWEAR.

06:00.442 --> 06:03.194
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE... MAYBE
THIS COULD BE YOUR THING.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.429
THIS IS DEFINITELY
MY THING.

06:04.496 --> 06:06.631
NOW, COME ON.
LET'S RIDE THIS TRUCK

06:06.698 --> 06:08.600
TO AN EARLY
RETIREMENT, HUH?

06:08.667 --> 06:10.969
HA HA HA HA HA!

06:11.036 --> 06:13.771
AND YOU WANTED
TO MARRY A DOCTOR.

06:20.646 --> 06:24.299
HEY, WHO WANTS TO PLAY
A BOARD GAME?

06:24.366 --> 06:25.300
I DO, DADDY.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.202
SOUNDS GREAT.

06:27.269 --> 06:30.037
HOW ABOUT YOU, HONEY?

06:30.105 --> 06:32.373
I'M OK. THANKS.

06:32.441 --> 06:35.043
ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS
PICK OUT A GAME.

06:35.110 --> 06:36.544
I'M GONNA MAKE US
SOME POPCORN.

06:36.611 --> 06:38.379
OK.

06:38.446 --> 06:41.616
UH, YOU KNOW, CARRIE,

06:41.683 --> 06:45.719
WE WERE HIRED TO ACT
LIKE A FAMILY HERE.

06:45.787 --> 06:49.307
AND MOM IS READING
A MAGAZINE,

06:49.374 --> 06:53.911
AND THEN SHE'S GONNA GO
OUTSIDE AND HAVE A CIGARETTE.

06:53.979 --> 06:56.113
OH, LET'S PLAY MONOPOLY.

06:56.181 --> 06:57.882
NAH. I WANT
OUTBURST.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.083
I DON'T WANNA PLAY OUTBURST.

06:59.150 --> 07:00.818
BECAUSE YOU SUCK
AT IT, DUMBASS.

07:00.886 --> 07:03.187
HEY, THE CASTING DIRECTOR SAID
YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO CURSE.

07:03.254 --> 07:04.922
WELL, IF YOU WEREN'T A
DUMBASS, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

07:04.990 --> 07:06.724
YOU QUIT IT. BRACE-FACE.
OK, QUIT IT.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.776
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

07:08.844 --> 07:11.579
I JUST READ THE SAME
SENTENCE 5 TIMES,

07:11.647 --> 07:13.715
AND I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW
HEIDI KLUM LOST THE BABY WEIGHT.

07:13.782 --> 07:17.084

07:17.152 --> 07:18.485
BUT HE CURSED AT ME.

07:18.553 --> 07:20.788
OK, LISTEN...

07:20.855 --> 07:22.089

07:22.157 --> 07:23.975
HE'S ONLY DOING THAT
TO PUSH YOUR BUTTONS,

07:24.043 --> 07:26.277
SO STOP LETTING IT
BOTHER YOU,

07:26.345 --> 07:27.578
AND... BOY...

07:27.646 --> 07:29.330

07:31.317 --> 07:33.017
NOW HERE'S HOW

07:33.085 --> 07:34.418
YOU'RE GONNA PLAY MONOPOLY... BUT-

07:34.486 --> 07:37.205
YOU'RE GONNA PLAY MONOPOLY.

07:37.272 --> 07:39.506
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S
FOR THE DUMBASS COMMENT.

07:39.574 --> 07:42.577

07:49.434 --> 07:51.702
OK, YOU COME

07:51.770 --> 07:52.936

13:20.765 --> 13:21.832
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.083
YOU KNOW HOW
I'VE BEEN WORKING

13:23.151 --> 13:24.618
AT THIS MODEL HOME
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS?

13:24.685 --> 13:25.385
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

13:25.537 --> 13:27.054
WELL... OH, MY GOD.

13:27.089 --> 13:29.874
I'M KIND OF EMBARRASSED
TO EVEN SAY IT OUT LOUD.

13:29.941 --> 13:34.045
WIFFLEBALL BAT. WHAT THE
HELL AM I GONNA DO WITH THAT?

13:34.112 --> 13:37.581
BUT, LOOK, I KNOW IT'S NOT
REAL AND I'M JUST PRETENDING,

13:37.649 --> 13:40.651
BUT I'M ACTUALLY
STARTING TO ENJOY IT.

13:40.719 --> 13:41.902
I LIKE BEING A MOM.

13:41.970 --> 13:44.972
I LIKE HAVING A HUSBAND WHO
TUCKS HIS SHIRT IN, YOU KNOW?

13:45.040 --> 13:48.859
I LIKE HAVING A SKYLIGHT
OVER THE SINK.

13:48.927 --> 13:51.178
DOING DISHES...

13:51.246 --> 13:54.114
IT'S A JOY.

13:54.182 --> 13:55.799
I KNOW I'M NOT CRAZY.
I'M NOT.

13:55.867 --> 13:57.501
BUT IT'S JUST THAT IT'S
GETTING HARDER AND HARDER

13:57.569 --> 13:59.737
NOT TO FALL INTO
THIS FANTASY AND-

13:59.804 --> 14:01.005
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:01.073 --> 14:03.674
I'M KICKING ASS
AND TAKING NAMES.

14:03.742 --> 14:07.511
DOUG, I AM TRYING
TO TALK TO YOU HERE.

14:07.579 --> 14:09.479
I'M HAPPY IN THE MODEL HOME,

14:09.548 --> 14:11.214
HAPPIER THAN I AM HERE.

14:11.282 --> 14:13.350
I'M FALLING IN LOVE
WITH MY FAKE FAMILY.

14:14.419 --> 14:15.853
QUICK, GET DOWN!

14:20.024 --> 14:22.543
WHAT IS GOING ON?

14:22.610 --> 14:26.380
I'M BEING STALKED
BY MR. SOFT SERVE.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.180
WHAT?

14:27.248 --> 14:28.115
DON'T WORRY.

14:28.183 --> 14:29.700
HE'S GOT
THE UPPER HAND NOW,

14:29.768 --> 14:31.369
BUT I'M THINKING ON IT,

14:31.436 --> 14:33.871
AND SOON THE HUNTER'S
GONNA BECOME THE HUNTED.

14:33.939 --> 14:35.506
YEAH.

14:36.958 --> 14:39.026
DOUG?

14:39.093 --> 14:41.928
I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME
A REASON TO STAY.

14:45.717 --> 14:48.219
I GOTTA PEE AGAIN.

14:48.287 --> 14:49.186
KEEP LOW.

15:17.632 --> 15:19.366
OK.

15:19.434 --> 15:21.668
NEXT TIME, CHECK
FOR THE BIG OPEN DOOR.

17:07.008 --> 17:08.724
THERE THEY ARE.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.760
OH.

17:10.828 --> 17:11.962
HEY, CARRIE.

17:12.029 --> 17:13.297
HEY, FUN IDEA.

17:13.364 --> 17:16.415
TODAY AT LUNCH, LET'S ALL
GET MATCHING SHIRTS.

17:18.953 --> 17:21.922
ACTUALLY, I ALREADY
HAVE LUNCH PLANS.

17:21.989 --> 17:23.589
OH. WELL, CHANGE 'EM, BABY.
COME ON.

17:23.657 --> 17:26.060
WE HAVE TO SPEND TIME
AS A FAMILY.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.963
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA BE OUT OF THE HOUSE AND...

17:29.030 --> 17:31.732
STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP,
STOP, STOP, STOP.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.451
HEY, SAVE SOME ROOM,

17:34.519 --> 17:37.921
'CAUSE I'M MAKING
BLUEBERRY MUFFINS.

17:40.191 --> 17:41.591
BOB...

17:41.659 --> 17:44.128
WHO'S THAT WOMAN?

17:44.195 --> 17:47.598
UH, THIS IS CHERYL.

17:47.666 --> 17:51.702
CASTING SENT HER OVER,
SO YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.020
WHAT?

17:53.088 --> 17:54.654
HEY, CARRIE.

17:54.723 --> 17:56.957
OH, MR. KAUFMAN.

17:57.025 --> 17:58.275
I GUESS THEY SENT OVER
ANOTHER MOM,

17:58.343 --> 18:00.644
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
ACTUALLY, I'M FINE DOING IT.

18:00.712 --> 18:01.678
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
CARRIE.

18:01.746 --> 18:04.848
I CAME TO TAKE YOU
BACK TO THE OFFICE.

18:04.916 --> 18:07.701
MR. KAUFMAN,
I'M NOT A QUITTER.

18:07.769 --> 18:09.502
HON, WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME BACK THE APRON.

18:09.570 --> 18:10.988
OH, THAT'S OK.

18:11.055 --> 18:13.590
NO. GIVE IT BACK TO ME
OR I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN.

18:14.976 --> 18:17.310
YES? CARRIE, I REALLY THINK...

18:17.378 --> 18:20.180
NO. MR. KAUFMAN,
THIS IS NOT FAIR TO BOB,

18:20.248 --> 18:22.015
ESPECIALLY
CHARLOTTE AND KENNY,

18:22.083 --> 18:23.550
TO CHANGE MOMS LIKE THIS.

18:23.618 --> 18:24.384
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE OPRAH

18:24.452 --> 18:27.020
TO KNOW THAT'S
GONNA MESS 'EM UP.

18:28.807 --> 18:30.540
THE TRUTH IS...

18:30.608 --> 18:32.943
YOU'RE BEING REPLACED
BECAUSE

18:33.061 --> 18:35.563
THEY COMPLAINED
ABOUT YOU.

18:36.397 --> 18:37.515
WHAT?

18:37.582 --> 18:39.583
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU
IN THE CAR.

18:42.887 --> 18:44.455
SO YOU DID THIS?

18:44.523 --> 18:45.990
IT'S JUST...

18:46.057 --> 18:49.326
YOU MADE US FEEL
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE,

18:49.394 --> 18:54.498
YOU KNOW, WITH THE KISSES
AND THE FAMILY NAPS.

18:56.868 --> 18:58.468
AND YOU GUYS
ARE OK WITH THIS?

18:58.536 --> 19:01.038
I MEAN, YOU WANT HER TO
BE THE MOM AND NOT ME?

19:01.105 --> 19:02.706
UH-HUH.

19:02.773 --> 19:06.776
YOU WERE COOL UNTIL YOU
KIND OF WENT ALL NUTBAR.

19:06.844 --> 19:08.561
DID I GO NUTBAR,
KENNY? REALLY?

19:08.629 --> 19:09.763
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WENT NUTBAR

19:09.831 --> 19:11.631
WHEN I GOT THAT
SPLINTER OUT FOR YOU.

19:11.699 --> 19:13.317
AND YOU HAD NO PROBLEM
WITH THE NUTBAR

19:13.384 --> 19:15.319
WHEN I WAS DOING
YOUR MATH HOMEWORK.

19:15.386 --> 19:18.572
I GOT
A CHECK MINUS MINUS.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.991
THAT IS NOT THE POINT, OK?

19:21.059 --> 19:23.493
THE POINT IS EVERYTHING
I DID I DID WITH LOVE.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.062
AND THIS IS THE THANKS I
GET? WELL, THAT'S FINE, OK?

19:25.129 --> 19:27.097
IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT,
THEN FORGET IT, OK?

19:27.165 --> 19:28.231
NO MORE COOKIES,
NO MORE ADVICE,

19:28.299 --> 19:30.434
AND NO MORE OF THIS.

19:30.501 --> 19:33.571
YEAH, BOB, YOU DIDN'T THINK I
CAUGHT YOU ENJOYING THAT VIEW?

19:33.638 --> 19:35.706
BECAUSE I DID.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.323
CARRIE...

19:37.391 --> 19:39.492
I'M GAY.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.801
HOW MUCH MORE
AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE?

19:50.655 --> 19:52.923
I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU $1,200.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.225
BUT I PAID YOU 3,000.

19:56.744 --> 19:57.778
FINE.

20:01.616 --> 20:02.883
HEY, KID.

20:02.950 --> 20:04.651
YEAH?

20:04.719 --> 20:06.270
CATCH.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.673
THANKS.

20:15.663 --> 20:17.497
HEY, THIS TRUCK
REALLY FOR SALE?

20:17.565 --> 20:18.748
SURE IS.

20:18.816 --> 20:21.785
MY NAME IS CAL.
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

20:21.852 --> 20:23.887
YOU KNOW, IT'S A GREAT
LITTLE INVESTMENT.

20:23.955 --> 20:26.423
IT GOT ME
A CONDO IN FLORIDA.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.024
A CONDO? NICE.

20:35.850 --> 20:37.885
FRESH BAKED COOKIES.

20:37.952 --> 20:40.236
SO SWEET. MMM.

20:43.224 --> 20:44.908
YOU STILL WANNA PLAY
MONOPOLY?

20:44.976 --> 20:46.643
I'M GONNA GO
HAVE A CIGARETTE.
