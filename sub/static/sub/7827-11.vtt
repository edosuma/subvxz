Homer, tell your child
what you bought

to get some insurance.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.838

03:33.922 --> 03:35.590

03:38.384 --> 03:40.053
I wish to report

03:40.136 --> 03:42.472

03:46.935 --> 03:49.520
Well, there doesn't seem
to be any pattern yet,

03:49.604 --> 03:52.398
but if I take this one
and move it here...

03:52.482 --> 03:54.817
and I move these
over here--

03:54.901 --> 03:58.738
Hello! It almost looks
like an arrow.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.448
Hey, look,

04:00.531 --> 04:02.700
Chief, it's pointing right
at this police station.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.995
-Let's get out of here!
-(all screaming)

04:09.624 --> 04:12.877
When cat burglaries start,
can mass murders be far behind?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.712
This reporter isn't saying
that the burglar is

04:14.796 --> 04:16.589
an inhuman monster
like the wolfman,

04:16.673 --> 04:18.091
but he very well could be.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.717
So, professor,

04:19.801 --> 04:21.552
would you say it's time
for everyone to panic?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.429
Yes, I would, Kent.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.848
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.601
We have a major break
in the case.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.395
We recovered
the burglar's handkerchief

04:30.478 --> 04:32.480
from one of the crime scenes.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.565
Now, one sniff
of this baby,

04:34.649 --> 04:36.818
and our tracking dog
will be hot on his trail.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.904
Gosh, look at me.
I'm sweatin' like a pig here.

04:39.988 --> 04:44.617
Ah. Ah, man.
That's better.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.119

04:46.202 --> 04:47.412

04:54.711 --> 04:57.171
Oh! Any questions?

04:57.255 --> 04:58.256
Well, as you can see,

04:58.339 --> 05:00.216
when the burglar
trips the alarm,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.427
the house raises
from its foundations,

05:02.510 --> 05:05.388
and runs down the street and
around the corner to safety.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.766
(nervous chuckle)

05:08.850 --> 05:11.519

the real humans won't, uh--

05:11.602 --> 05:13.855

family security rules.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.962

06:20.046 --> 06:21.130
and make sure
you're not followed.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.341
Lock all doors
and windows.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.343
And don't take candy
from strangers.

06:25.426 --> 06:26.761
Marge, they're only human!

06:26.844 --> 06:29.347
What's the point
of all these precautions?

06:29.430 --> 06:30.473
I've already lost

06:30.556 --> 06:32.141
the only thing
that matters to me.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.519
Oh, Lisa, stop pining
for your saxophone.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.145

another instrument.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.148

that horn meant to you.

06:55.498 --> 06:59.043

Daddy's gonna get it back.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.505

I'll figure out something.

you did too.

a lot of great things,

08:25.171 --> 08:27.340

a very old man now,

08:27.423 --> 08:29.717

11:27.269 --> 11:29.647
Wow! Can I join ya?

11:29.730 --> 11:30.773
I don't know.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.692
Can you swing a sack
of doorknobs?

11:32.775 --> 11:35.111
-Can I!
-You're in. Here's the sack.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.321
But you gotta supply
your own knobs.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.740
So I said to him,
"Look, buddy,

11:39.824 --> 11:42.410
"your car was upside down
when we got here.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.078
"And as for your grandma,

11:44.161 --> 11:46.080
she shouldn't have
mouthed off like that!"

11:46.163 --> 11:47.998
Dad, don't you see
you're abusing your power

11:48.082 --> 11:49.875
like all vigilantes?

11:49.959 --> 11:53.212
I mean, if you're the police,
who will police the police?

11:53.295 --> 11:55.297
I dunno.
Coast Guard?

11:55.381 --> 11:58.050
Homer, wasn't the whole point
to catch the cat burglar?

11:58.134 --> 12:00.261
And I still don't have
my saxophone.

12:00.344 --> 12:03.097
Lisa, the mob is working on
getting your saxophone back,

12:03.180 --> 12:05.975
but we've also expanded
into other important areas.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.282
Mr. Simpson, how do you respond
to the charge

12:21.365 --> 12:24.618
that petty vandalism
such as graffiti is down 80%,

12:24.702 --> 12:28.330
while heavy sack beatings
are up a shocking 900%?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.207
Oh, people can
come up with statistics

12:30.291 --> 12:31.417
to prove anything, Kent.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.794
Forfty percent
of all people know that.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.464
I see. Well, what do you
say to the accusation

12:36.547 --> 12:37.757
that your group
has been causing more crimes

12:37.840 --> 12:38.799
than it's been preventing?

12:38.883 --> 12:40.718
Oh, Kent, I'd be lying

12:40.801 --> 12:43.429

weren't committing crimes.

Hmm, touché.

we have our first caller.

this is not a call-in show.

-We'll be right back.
-I get to say that!

13:51.497 --> 13:55.626
Son, we want to help you
catch that plug-ugly yegg.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.337
Dad, the best way
for you to help

13:58.420 --> 13:59.964
is to set a good example.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.882
Just stand around
and don't steal anything.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.096
-Hey!
-We're on our break!

14:07.179 --> 14:09.682
-Any sign of the burglar yet?
-He'll show.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.058
-How's that?
-It's his job.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.434

You'd like to get in here,

14:26.574 --> 14:28.701
There's just
one little problem--

thirty-six years ago,
some lady gave birth to

No, actually I fell down

15:48.739 --> 15:50.991
Son, I've come
to help you.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.285
I know who
the cat burglar is.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.328
-What?
-Who?

15:54.411 --> 15:55.371
-Huh?
-What?

15:55.454 --> 15:57.665
Well, well, well.

15:57.748 --> 16:01.543

and no one wanted my help.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.506

to old grandpa with--

Wait! Where are you going?
Come back. I'll tell you.

16:08.759 --> 16:12.262
He was right under my nose
the whole time.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.306
He lives in my
retirement home.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.849
His name is Malloy.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.602
Wow! How'd you
track him down, Grandpa?

16:18.686 --> 16:20.604
Good question.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.690

16:30.072 --> 16:31.907
My next clue came
just yesterday

16:31.991 --> 16:33.242
at the museum.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.577
We felt slighted
by your age bashing

16:35.661 --> 16:37.413
and started home.

16:37.496 --> 16:41.291
<i>Malloy said,</i>
<i>"I'll catch up with you."</i>

16:45.045 --> 16:47.840
<i>I couldn't quite</i>
<i>put my finger on it.</i>

16:47.923 --> 16:50.926
<i>There was something strange</i>

16:51.010 --> 16:53.679

16:53.762 --> 16:57.641
And finally, Malloy,
unlike most retired people,

has the world's largest
cubic zirconia

17:04.314 --> 17:05.816
Well, kiss me right here.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.922
So, Mr. Malloy,

17:29.006 --> 17:31.717
it seems that the cat
has been caught

17:31.800 --> 17:35.804
by the very person
that was trying to catch him.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.515
-How ironic.
-Homer, old chap, well done.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.350
If anyone
was going to catch me,

17:40.434 --> 17:41.852
I'm glad it was you.

17:41.935 --> 17:45.773
Actually, it wasn't me.
It was my dad, Grandpa.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.775
Thanks, son.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.653
So you see, old people
aren't so useless after all.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.531
Malloy's old, and he
outsmarted the lot of you.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.992
And I'm even older,
and I outsmarted him!

17:57.076 --> 17:59.119
(laughing)

17:59.203 --> 18:01.205
-Shut up.
-I've had my moment.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.582

I'm happy to return

-Oh, sorry, folks.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.748
Gee, I really hate to spoil
this little love-in,

18:44.832 --> 18:47.209

broke the law.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.795
And when you break the law,
you gotta go to jail.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.714

Uh, here's your monthly kickback.
