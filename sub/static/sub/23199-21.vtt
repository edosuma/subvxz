WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:05.200
Yeah. You tell them that.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.920
Yes, and what's more, tell them I meant it.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.800
Ed, you handle that, too.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.840
And please make sure it's at least
15 minutes before you call me back, okay?

00:20.760 --> 00:24.600
Somebody ought to write a bestseller
about the newspaper industry...

00:25.200 --> 00:27.000
and call it Jellyfish.

00:27.560 --> 00:31.320
Some of my managing editors have
as much backbone as an earthworm.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.200
Now I understand why you installed
a phone on this ship...

00:34.280 --> 00:36.520
before you did an anchor, Mr. Penrose.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.120
I didn't want to see myself
coming back into port...

00:39.200 --> 00:42.080
the proud publisher of 18 Weekly Readers.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.960
You know,
I think we're getting back just in time.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.120
It looks like it's starting to close in.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.800
I think you're right.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.960
What is that over there?

00:55.720 --> 00:57.760
I don't know. Let's take a look.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.960
- Looks like somebody on a raft.
- You're right.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.120
- Let's get over there.
- Yes, sir.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.680
All right, cut the engine!

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.080 --> 01:57.280
- Is she breathing?
- Yeah, I think so.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.960
Come on, let's get her on board ship.
Take her to a hospital.

02:10.759 --> 02:14.320
Let her try to paddle back
to that world from which she came.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.840
Fools and ingrates. They surround us.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.800
Now, now...

02:23.880 --> 02:27.440
we shan't worry, my lovely.
The lost has been found.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.720
Simon Penrose has her now.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.720
But he won't have her long.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.280
Yes?

03:50.240 --> 03:51.320
Who?

03:52.240 --> 03:53.440
Penrose.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.280
Right. Put him on.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.800
Diana? Simon Penrose.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.960
Simon. It's been a long time.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.280
How are you?

04:02.360 --> 04:04.720
I'm fine, and I'm in need of a favor.

04:05.120 --> 04:09.960
Seeing as how the last time I think
it was me saying that, I'm listening.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.080
I'm out here in California, Long Beach.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.120
We picked up a little girl
out of the ocean yesterday.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.399
She was, and still is, unconscious
and has been hospitalized.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.600
Who is she?

04:20.680 --> 04:23.320
That's one question
nobody seems to be able to answer.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.000
She matches no missing persons report.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.880
Fingerprints, footprints have been
run through a couple hundred computers...

04:29.960 --> 04:31.400
Without any ruffle.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.800
- That sounds hard to believe.
- Yes.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.480
It's hard for an old newspaperman
like me to accept.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.840
That's why I'm calling you.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.200
I'd like you to come out here
and see if you can help identify her.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.480
Simon, the IADC has people
who specialize in that sort of thing.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.560
And they also have people
who specialize...

04:47.680 --> 04:50.280
in evasive rhetoric
and bureaucratic double-talk.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.240
If I wanted heartburn,
I would have called them.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.840
But I want straight answers, Diana.
That's why I'm calling you.

04:56.920 --> 05:00.160
I guess I could be there tomorrow.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.240
You can be here this afternoon.
My plane's waiting for you at Dulles.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.800
It's nice to know you haven't changed,
Simon.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.840
And what I'm hoping is that you haven't.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.560
Oceanside Hospital, Long Beach.
There'll be a pass for you at the door.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.800
- Any changes, Jerry?
- I'm afraid not.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.320
Why is it you can't seem
to do anything for her?

05:45.400 --> 05:47.800
She's not responding to treatment
like she should.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.480
She's just as much a mystery
to everyone in my field...

05:50.560 --> 05:52.040
as she is to everyone in yours.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.440
Yeah, but she may die without anyone
knowing so much as her name.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.880
Now look, as a newspaperman
and a human being...

05:58.000 --> 06:00.560
I find that possibility abhorrent.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.000
I'm afraid it's a very real one.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.320
I'll be in my office.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.080
I'm expecting a woman, Diana Prince.
She should be here this afternoon.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.360
I expect full cooperation
from you and your staff.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.280
All available interns report to Emergency.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.360
I know you're Barbie.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.840
They told me there was a goddess
on the sixth floor.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.440
So you must be Barbie.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.240
You must be a new intern.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.200
Lou Davis, budding
but brilliant radiologist.

07:22.280 --> 07:27.160
Barbie Brown, brilliant but
married-with-two-children RN.

07:48.920 --> 07:53.760
He's at that age where
absolutely nothing in the house is sacred.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.000
Okay, I'm convinced...

07:58.720 --> 08:01.360
and extremely disappointed.

08:01.680 --> 08:05.520
Well, as I'm sure they say in x-ray,
"That's the breaks. "

08:07.480 --> 08:10.880
- See you later, Barbie.
- Don't count on it, Lou.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.480
Hold it.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.120
Miss, you can't go in there.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.360
I'm Diana Prince. I'm from the IADC.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.240
They gave me
special clearance downstairs.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.039
Okay, right. Mr. Penrose is expecting you.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.360
I'd like to tell you she's getting better,
but I'm afraid...

08:50.560 --> 08:51.920
How could this happen?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.160
The doctor was just in here!

08:55.400 --> 08:57.000
It's the men with the cart.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.520
- The elevator.
- I'll call security.

10:11.480 --> 10:16.000
You better look after her, Wonder Woman.
She's more important to you than we are.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.200
Get after them!

11:03.680 --> 11:06.400
You'd better hurry up and get well,
young lady.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.760
We have a lot to talk about.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.760
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:25.120 --> 11:28.440
Looks like you're recovering quite nicely.
How's your food?

11:28.520 --> 11:29.600
It's okay.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.040
Not quite chocolate shake and fries, is it?

11:33.400 --> 11:36.320
- Someone brought you clothes.
- Simon did.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.120
I wish I had a blouse like this.
It's beautiful.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.280
- May I sit down?
- Sure.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.160
My name is Diana,
and I'm a friend of Mr. Penrose.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.200
What's your name?

11:53.040 --> 11:55.720
I know this must be all
very confusing to you.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.520
This country must be very different
from the one you're from.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.640
I know the jewelry that you wear...

12:06.720 --> 12:09.200
lets you do things
no other boys and girls can do.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.600
And I also know
that it cannot be taken off.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.400
Did someone try to kidnap you...

12:15.480 --> 12:18.160
because of that necklace
and those bracelets?

12:18.880 --> 12:20.000
How did you know?

12:20.080 --> 12:23.360
The woman you saw before,
when those men tried to hurt you...

12:23.440 --> 12:26.720
- Wonder Woman?
- She told me about llandia.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.160
That's where you're from, isn't it?

12:30.800 --> 12:33.960
- Can Wonder Woman take me back?
- Maybe.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.080
If she can figure out who kidnapped you.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.320
He's awful.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.280
His eyes...

12:43.080 --> 12:44.600
they shine.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.080
I was afraid...

12:47.560 --> 12:48.680
Bleaker.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.600
I was afraid people would laugh at me...

12:52.440 --> 12:54.800
if I tried to tell them where I'm from.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.360
I was scared they wouldn't believe me.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.560
I know.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.560
It's nice to see you eating
like a football player.

13:07.240 --> 13:11.200
You think she'll be in shape
in time for the Broncos' summer training?

13:11.600 --> 13:13.800
If the Broncos are lucky, she will.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.280
I'll tell you what, little girl...

13:16.360 --> 13:18.840
and I'm getting tired
of calling you little girl...

13:18.920 --> 13:21.840
You know what?
I'll give you another name, Tina. All right?

13:21.920 --> 13:24.480
Unless you want to tell me
your real name.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.080
- Tina's fine.
- All right, then Tina it is.

13:29.320 --> 13:33.080
Although I don't know how it'll look
on the Bronco roster. "Tina. "

13:33.200 --> 13:35.760
Simon, can I talk to you outside
for a minute?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.560
- Is it important?
- Yeah.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.840
Fine. See you in a little while.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.080
I'll be right back.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.720
What is it?

13:49.840 --> 13:52.160
I hope you'll tell me
your IADC connections...

13:52.240 --> 13:53.480
have come up with something.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.000
No, they're still working on it.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.040
What I want to talk to you about is that...

13:59.320 --> 14:01.520
Simon, I think you're pushing too hard.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.280
She has to learn to trust us.
She needs time.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.680
Diana, time has long been
an enemy of mine...

14:06.760 --> 14:09.880
as it is with those whose life is composed
of deadlines.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.800
In fact, I have a metallurgist
coming up here in about 20 minutes...

14:13.880 --> 14:16.280
to try to trace the jewelry
that she's wearing.

14:16.360 --> 14:19.560
Now, Simon,
she's very protective of that jewelry.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.600
She might object.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.280
I'm sure that in the miracles
of modern medicine...

14:25.360 --> 14:28.560
there is a pill or two
that would overrule her objections.

14:28.640 --> 14:32.240
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
You're pushing too hard.

14:32.320 --> 14:36.560
Me, pushing? I'm just trying to find out
who she is and where she came from.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.760
In doing so, you're gonna
scare this girl half to death.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.840
She already feels like a freak.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.160
I have been around in this business
for over 30 years.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.040
I know exactly what I'm doing.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.520
That hardly qualifies you
for an award in human relations...

14:51.600 --> 14:53.440
does it, Mr. Penrose?

15:23.920 --> 15:27.320
Besides which, I'd like to remind you
that you did fly me out here...

15:27.400 --> 15:31.160
and I assume it was because
you trusted my judgment.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.040
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry, Diana.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.880
I do trust your judgment.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.840
It's just that this kid's
become such an obsession with me.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.480
And I don't know why or what it is.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.160
You did name her Tina.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.560
Yeah. So what?

15:44.640 --> 15:47.200
Your wife's name was Christine, wasn't it?

15:47.280 --> 15:50.360
Yeah.
And she had blond hair and blue eyes.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.560
But spare me the psychology lesson,
Miss Prince.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.960
Let's just focus our attention
on the living.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.600
Tina?

17:09.440 --> 17:12.119
Please, come get me.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.440
Come on, boy! I'm not gonna hurt you.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.680
Come on. That's good.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.320
Come here, boy. Come on!

17:45.680 --> 17:49.200
That's right, come on.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.320
Come here, boy! Come on.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.800
Come on, boy. Come on.

18:10.200 --> 18:13.040
Yeah. That's it. That's a good boy.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.080
See, I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.040
You wanna play?

18:19.040 --> 18:21.200
Here's a stick. Can you go get it?

18:27.880 --> 18:30.560
Come on, boy, come on.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.040
Can you get that?

18:35.560 --> 18:38.400
You're lost, too, aren't you? Just like me.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.960
You wish you could go home, too.

18:44.360 --> 18:48.080
The people I miss
are somewhere out there.

18:49.240 --> 18:53.000
They don't know what's happening to me.
But I'm trying to go home.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.000
And I will go home.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.600
And when I do...

19:00.080 --> 19:01.600
I'll never leave...

19:02.120 --> 19:04.520
never, ever again.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.080
She's gone?

19:12.160 --> 19:14.080
I'm sorry to hear that, Diana.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.640
You think she was abducted?

19:15.720 --> 19:16.960
We're not sure yet.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.200
Have you got anything
on those fingerprints...

19:19.280 --> 19:21.280
of the two men
who tried to take her before?

19:21.360 --> 19:22.440
I'm afraid not.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.720
Ira, much to his embarrassment,
drew a complete blank.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.560
Let's give him a chance to redeem himself.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.960
I'd like a readout on everything he's got
on a scientist named Bleaker.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.520
Bleaker?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.400
He's a legend, Diana.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.160
A mythological antihero
of the underworld.

19:39.240 --> 19:42.880
Antihero, yes. Myth, no.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.240
I have reason to believe he's all too real.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.480
Come on. We'll get you something to eat.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.280
You found something, huh?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.400
Good for you.

20:27.880 --> 20:28.960
What do you want?

20:29.040 --> 20:30.840
You're gonna do me a little favor.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.120
- Forget it.
- No, you forget it!

20:33.520 --> 20:36.720
Now. See that window up there?

20:36.960 --> 20:40.040
All I want is for you
to crawl through that window...

20:41.160 --> 20:44.640
go around to the side door,
and open it up for me.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.160
So you can rob the place?

20:48.240 --> 20:51.160
Maybe I'll share.
You're the right size. Let's go.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.760
Shut up, you stupid dog! Get out of here!

21:32.360 --> 21:33.520
This just in:

21:33.600 --> 21:37.040
Authorities in Long Beach report
that so-called mystery child...

21:37.120 --> 21:39.560
Who has been missing
since 12:30 this afternoon...

21:39.680 --> 21:41.080
has been found.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.760
Tina, as she has been nicknamed
by the press...

21:43.840 --> 21:45.880
remains in the custody of the police...

21:45.960 --> 21:50.400
Who still ha ve no clues as to
who she is or where she came from.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.520
Also in the news this evening...

21:52.600 --> 21:55.080
Did you hear that, my lovely?

21:55.160 --> 21:57.040
She's in custody!

21:57.120 --> 22:01.720
That means she can be watched, followed,
and at the proper moment, taken.

22:02.280 --> 22:06.080
We have her, my lovely!
We as good as have her!

22:09.240 --> 22:11.720
All the paperwork has been taken care of?

22:12.160 --> 22:16.160
My attorneys are finally working
for the retainers that I keep them on.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.920
Until Tina's parents are found,
she'll be in my custody.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.800
Here she is now. Tina!

22:33.760 --> 22:35.800
Hi, Simon. Hi, Diana.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.560
- Hello, Tina. How are you, sweetheart?
- Fine.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.960
- You ready to go home?
- Yeah.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.240
Hey, boy, come on!

22:48.440 --> 22:50.160
Look what she's got here.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.880
Would you like to take the dog
home with you?

22:54.960 --> 22:56.800
Please, yes. Can I?

22:58.240 --> 23:01.120
Of course you can.
Do you have a name for him?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.080
Tiger.

23:03.160 --> 23:05.600
Tiger. Well, what do you think of Tiger?

23:05.680 --> 23:07.440
I think Tiger's great.

23:07.560 --> 23:11.440
I'll try to make arrangements for you
to meet that lady that we talked about.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.600
Good.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.320
Let's go.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.160
- You two tigers look pretty hungry to me.
- Come on, Tiger!

23:17.280 --> 23:20.680
A friend of mine at the IADC
is checking a few leads right now...

23:20.760 --> 23:23.240
to find out exactly where she came from.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.800
- All right, fine.
- Okay?

23:25.880 --> 23:27.200
Can I give you a lift?

23:27.280 --> 23:30.080
No, I've got a cab waiting outside. Thanks.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.000
- Okay. Keep in touch.
- Yeah.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.720
Bleaker: a man rumored to have
two or more doctorates...

24:13.800 --> 24:16.000
in every major field of science.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.240
He allegedly possesses an IQ so high...

24:19.320 --> 24:21.320
he talks only to himself.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.240
Now wait a minute, Ira.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.320
Are you saying this man really does exist?

24:25.400 --> 24:30.080
The Irac computer is not prepared
to debate the question ofhis existence.

24:30.480 --> 24:34.320
Rather, I have simply compiled
all that has ever been attributed...

24:34.520 --> 24:38.320
to a man named Bleaker,
as requested by Steve Trevor.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.680
Okay. Forgive my outburst.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.640
You are only human.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.080
Yeah.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.720
Assuming Bleaker really does exist...

24:49.120 --> 24:51.760
do you have any indication
of his whereabouts?

24:51.840 --> 24:55.960
He is rumored to have been responsible
for the sabotage of oil tankers...

24:56.040 --> 24:59.760
off the California coast
by means of a submarine.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.880
Submarine?

25:04.000 --> 25:07.400
Then his headquarters could be
on or near a coast somewhere?

25:07.480 --> 25:09.360
A commendable deduction.

25:10.120 --> 25:13.040
Thanks. I'll get the word to Diana.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.600
- Good morning, Tina.
- Hi.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.840
He's happy here.

25:33.320 --> 25:36.240
How did little Tiger like his eggs?

25:36.760 --> 25:38.520
He likes the bacon better.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.720
I figured that.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.320
Let me give him some bacon. Here.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.520
Tina, when are you going to tell me
who you really are?

25:53.640 --> 25:54.880
I don't know.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.120
Okay.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.480
But can I tell you something?

26:00.560 --> 26:03.840
You know that you and I have a secret?
Did you know that?

26:07.200 --> 26:09.680
You don't want anybody to know
who you are...

26:09.760 --> 26:12.880
where you came from,
or why you ran away.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.280
Me...

26:17.480 --> 26:20.360
I don't want anybody to know
just how much...

26:21.080 --> 26:23.880
a certain gutsy 12-year-old little blonde...

26:24.680 --> 26:27.080
has come to mean...

26:27.640 --> 26:29.640
to a certain bachelor like me.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.040
The closest I ever let people come to me...

26:36.760 --> 26:38.680
was smack out of a headline.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.480
It was safer that way.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.960
I got hurt once.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.160
Maybe twice.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.280
But you just came smack
out of the headlines...

26:51.760 --> 26:53.840
and landed right here in my life.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.280
So, what I'm trying to say is that...

26:56.560 --> 26:59.760
if anybody ever hurt you
where you came from...

27:03.640 --> 27:05.920
and you don't ever wanna go back...

27:06.480 --> 27:07.680
you don't have to.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.520
But I wanna go home!

27:12.160 --> 27:13.360
You do?

27:15.280 --> 27:16.680
I mean, I...

27:18.720 --> 27:21.920
Whenever you decide that you're ready,
you let me know.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.760
I'll get you home.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.160
I'll see you tonight.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.960
Road's all clear. Let's go.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.360
Hold it.

28:16.440 --> 28:20.480
The regular laundry delivery
isn't until 11:00. We don't move till then.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.760
All right, if you say so.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.760
Come on, relax.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.280
Let's get our money's worth
out of the truck, right?

28:37.080 --> 28:38.360
Come on, Tiger!

28:43.960 --> 28:45.040
Good boy.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.440
Go get it!

28:53.840 --> 28:54.960
Hi, Tina.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.400
- Wonder Woman!
- Look at this.

28:57.480 --> 29:00.960
That's Tiger. He acts like he knows you.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.600
Wanna catch this ball? Come on!

29:07.520 --> 29:10.240
Now, what's your name, your real name?

29:10.600 --> 29:12.560
The one given to you in llandia?

29:12.640 --> 29:15.040
Diana said you knew where I was from.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.760
That's right. I do.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.480
I wanna go home.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.520
Please, take me home.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.200
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

29:31.200 --> 29:34.080
It's where the sun sets, across the ocean.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.120
I know it is!

29:39.360 --> 29:41.960
Ilandia is in a world within this world.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.760
It's in another dimension.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.440
There is just one doorway to that world...

29:50.120 --> 29:52.040
but I don't know where it is.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.960
I'll never go home?

29:57.840 --> 29:59.200
Yes, you will...

29:59.680 --> 30:02.280
because I'm going to find the man
who kidnapped you...

30:02.360 --> 30:04.120
and make him take you back.

30:04.200 --> 30:07.960
Now, as I remember from the books
I've read where I come from...

30:08.040 --> 30:10.560
only very, very special young people...

30:10.640 --> 30:13.680
are given bracelets and a necklace
like this, right?

30:14.400 --> 30:16.160
One in every 5,000.

30:16.960 --> 30:20.320
We're supposed to protect people,
like the policemen here.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.360
That man kidnapped me
just when I was learning how to use them.

30:26.640 --> 30:30.520
Well, how about if we see
just how much you have learned?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.080
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:29.320 --> 31:32.040
Now, that was terrific!
Let's try another one.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.080
Not bad.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.040
Not bad.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.240
That was very good.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.280
Now...

31:54.560 --> 31:55.640
try this.

32:05.760 --> 32:09.040
- I know, someday.
- Someday.

32:52.480 --> 32:53.920
Oh, no.

32:54.680 --> 32:55.760
Someday.

32:56.120 --> 32:57.240
Someday.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.800
Watch this.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.480
That's gonna land on the moon!

33:34.880 --> 33:37.080
There's one more thing
you should be able to do.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.320
What's that?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.720
If you hold your hands like this...

33:43.600 --> 33:47.560
and you concentrate hard enough
on making a shield around your body...

33:47.760 --> 33:50.520
you can make anything:
boats, knives, arrows...

33:50.600 --> 33:52.240
bounce off you without hitting.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.240
But only if you concentrate.

33:55.560 --> 33:56.840
Are you ready?

34:12.120 --> 34:13.520
Again! Throw it harder!

34:13.600 --> 34:15.239
Okay, but concentrate.

34:25.080 --> 34:27.159
- It can't hurt me!
- That's right.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.120
Only as long as you concentrate.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.719
The man who kidnapped me can't hurt me.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.000
Well, I don't know about that.

34:34.120 --> 34:37.239
If he tries to take me again,
like those men in the hospital...

34:37.320 --> 34:39.040
- I'll let him!
- No!

34:39.520 --> 34:41.400
Then I'll make him take me home.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.239
Promise me you'll do no such thing, Tina.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.239
You're not strong enough yet.

34:53.880 --> 34:56.280
My real name is Amadonna.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.760
That's beautiful.

34:59.840 --> 35:03.920
Amadonna, you just let me worry
about getting you home, okay?

35:04.760 --> 35:08.840
Pretty soon the people in llandia
won't care about me anymore.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.080
They'll always care about you.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.120
The people in your world
are no different from those in mine.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.680
Once they love someone,
they go right on loving.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.920
And they'll wait for that someone
to come back to them.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.880
Guess I'd better go now.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.920
Thanks, Wonder Woman.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.680
Trust me, Amadonna.

36:02.320 --> 36:06.520
Tiger, you take care ofher, and if
she's in trouble, you come and find me.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.360
Understand?

36:23.440 --> 36:26.000
Just a minute, little girl.
Don't you try anything.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.840
None of that funny stuff.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.320
Quiet, Tiger. Sit.

36:37.720 --> 36:40.040
Now you're being a smart little girl.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.400
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.120
Take a long look, sweetheart.

37:30.040 --> 37:34.040
You got away from me once before,
but I guarantee it won't happen again.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.960
They've taken Tina.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.280
Can you lead me to her?

38:29.240 --> 38:32.760
Okay. Hold on. I'll change first. Hang on.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.800
There, there, my lovely.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.800
We knew it was just a matter of time,
didn't we?

38:51.600 --> 38:55.840
Now we'll take immediate steps to see
that she never keeps us waiting again.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.000
Take me home.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.240
She looks none the worse,
despite her little escapade.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.680
Necklace, bracelets intact.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.320
As unremovable as ever.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.720
You're going to take me home!

39:10.640 --> 39:13.160
We were too gentle with her before.

39:14.120 --> 39:16.920
Too frightened of diminishing
those psychic energies...

39:17.000 --> 39:20.680
which the necklace and bracelets
transform into physical energy.

39:21.320 --> 39:24.360
Too gentle, too timid, too patient.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.800
Never again.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.720
Listen to me!

39:28.120 --> 39:32.120
You're going to take me back to llandia.
I can make you!

39:32.440 --> 39:34.240
We'll use the globe again.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.720
But this time, we'll be more thorough.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.480
We'll get rid of any and all thoughts
she ever had of going home.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.680
The coast. So it is Bleaker.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
Get to the phone, call the police, and
get them out here as soon as possible.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.560
Good boy. Now, you stay.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.080
No, I won't let you!

41:12.400 --> 41:13.560
Settle down.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.440
She knows!

41:31.840 --> 41:35.640
She knows that what she can do
is just a matter of thinking.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.440
You're going to take me home.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.800
Thinking, and concentration.

41:40.120 --> 41:44.040
What she doesn't know
is that concentration can be broken.

42:07.120 --> 42:12.000
Dr. Bleaker, I always wondered when I'd
have the displeasure of meeting you.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.880
She knows who we are.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.800
I've heard of you.

42:16.120 --> 42:19.480
But you should have stuck
to sabotaging oil tankers.

42:20.240 --> 42:23.520
Kidnapping little children isn't good
for anyone's image.

42:23.680 --> 42:28.080
She doesn't appreciate the fact that,
with such a child properly trained...

42:28.160 --> 42:29.760
we shall be untouchable.

42:29.880 --> 42:33.240
However, you did find the doorway
to her world.

42:33.320 --> 42:37.080
Wherever it is,
you are going to take her back.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.520
She knows of dimension travel?

42:40.680 --> 42:41.920
Of course.

42:42.160 --> 42:47.000
A mythological creature come true herself,
she can embrace all possibilities.

42:47.360 --> 42:50.000
Now, Bleaker. Take her back to llandia.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.760
Can it be that
we have a worthy adversary?

42:55.360 --> 42:59.280
Perhaps you'd like another demonstration
of my worthiness, Dr. Bleaker.

42:59.360 --> 43:02.840
She presents an obstacle
that must be destroyed.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.080
- Bleaker.
- It's poison.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.760
- Tiger!
- You stay here.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.240
He's tricked us.

44:30.680 --> 44:31.760
Oh, no!

44:43.120 --> 44:44.680
- Tina.
- Get away!

44:48.120 --> 44:49.960
He can't leave me here!

44:55.640 --> 44:57.480
I can't stop him.

44:58.680 --> 45:01.120
But I want to go home!

45:02.240 --> 45:04.560
Please make him take me home!

45:07.960 --> 45:09.720
You'll go home someday.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.000
I promise you.

45:14.800 --> 45:17.320
But until then,
you've gotta stop being so scared.

45:17.400 --> 45:19.520
- I'm not scared.
- Yes, you are.

45:20.600 --> 45:24.760
You're scared that all the things
you love and that you miss in llandia:

45:24.840 --> 45:29.480
your friends, your parents,
the people that you love...

45:29.600 --> 45:31.400
the people that love you...

45:31.920 --> 45:35.360
you're scared you're gonna find
all those things right here.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.360
You're scared that when someday comes...

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
you won't know
whether you really want to go back.

45:49.640 --> 45:52.480
It might hurt a lot when that day comes.

45:55.160 --> 45:57.200
But you have to take the chance.

45:59.120 --> 46:01.280
And right now, you have no choice.

46:04.880 --> 46:09.360
In llandia, I had a dolphin.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.080
We played tag in the ocean all the time.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.480
Her life is going
to be complicated enough...

46:36.560 --> 46:40.360
without the whole world knowing
who she is and where she came from.

46:40.440 --> 46:41.920
And so, gentlemen...

46:42.000 --> 46:45.040
your memories are about to become
a little faulty.

47:09.080 --> 47:10.760
Are you all right, Tina?

47:11.440 --> 47:13.120
I want to go home...

47:14.920 --> 47:16.040
with you.

47:18.440 --> 47:19.520
Really?

47:20.840 --> 47:22.760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

47:25.960 --> 47:28.320
You don't know how happy
that makes me.

47:29.400 --> 47:32.920
I guess I'm going to let a 12-year-old
little girl break my heart.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.160
I'll take chances, if you will.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.480
I've heard that line before.

47:38.640 --> 47:41.800
I guess I have to thank you a lot
for what you've done.

47:42.360 --> 47:44.600
Tina's quite a special little girl.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.160
She sure is.

47:46.360 --> 47:49.640
She's one human-interest story
that I'm gonna have to live with...

47:49.720 --> 47:52.080
for the rest of my life, if I'm lucky.
