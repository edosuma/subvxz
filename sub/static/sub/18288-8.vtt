WEBVTT

00:02.019 --> 00:05.620
Listen, I can't tell you I didn't think about it.

00:06.897 --> 00:08.563
I was kidding. It's not like I would ever do

00:08.598 --> 00:09.875
something like that.

00:12.035 --> 00:13.793
I like my freedom, I do. I...

00:14.678 --> 00:15.989
Ask any one of my friends out there,

00:15.990 --> 00:17.580
and they can tell you the same thing.

00:17.989 --> 00:20.573
You know what really sorts to piss me off me after all?

00:20.608 --> 00:23.370
It's when couples always say the word "we".

00:23.962 --> 00:25.090
I hate it.

00:25.126 --> 00:29.140
"We think, we may, we might", but "we feel", that's the big one.

00:29.185 --> 00:30.675
Feeling

00:30.705 --> 00:32.762
is a solitary emotion.

00:34.044 --> 00:35.611
So you and me

00:35.659 --> 00:37.811
feel like you're feeling in love and I,

00:37.848 --> 00:40.920
me, might feel like I'm being caged.

00:41.498 --> 00:43.271
The other day, they, uh,

00:43.916 --> 00:45.263
they were putting that

00:45.276 --> 00:47.461
"for sale" sign for Bette and Tina's house.

00:49.135 --> 00:51.960
And Jenny came straighting over with her video camera,

00:51.998 --> 00:54.161
wishing making this tribute video for them.

00:56.007 --> 00:57.271
She asked me to say something.

00:57.308 --> 00:58.622
Ready?
Yeah.

01:00.906 --> 01:02.103
I couldn't get a fucking word out

01:02.148 --> 01:03.932
because everything she was saying was "we".

01:03.975 --> 01:07.523
And we are wishing you well on your trip to New York.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.250
Which I realize is kind of an adventure for you guys, right?

01:10.298 --> 01:11.631
And I was thinking that

01:12.275 --> 01:15.212
it's actually an adventure for us, too.

01:16.525 --> 01:19.172
Okay, just follow me here. It's an adventure 

01:19.206 --> 01:20.962
because, with you guys leaving,

01:20.998 --> 01:22.733
you guys were

01:22.765 --> 01:26.081
the supreme-wonderful-beautific couple 

01:26.118 --> 01:27.173
and

01:27.237 --> 01:28.760
now we

01:28.805 --> 01:30.451
are taking, we're gonna take your place

01:30.487 --> 01:31.890
because we're the only ones left.

01:31.935 --> 01:35.363
So this is really, really exciting. So I give you

01:35.405 --> 01:36.560
my word

01:37.046 --> 01:38.340
that we're gonna make it.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.045 --> 01:49.472
I love Tasha.

01:52.818 --> 01:55.833
I don't think you understand how much.

02:01.066 --> 02:03.530
I don't think you realize either.

02:03.578 --> 02:05.442
I love you, too.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.013
I guess I'm just

02:21.086 --> 02:24.240
asking you guys to be honest

02:24.788 --> 02:26.643
about what's going on.

02:27.548 --> 02:31.302
Alice, I swear to you.
Nothing has happened between us.

02:33.006 --> 02:35.890
I know nothing's happened between you

02:38.747 --> 02:40.021
physically.

02:43.458 --> 02:46.450
I'm sure you guys haven't even admitted it to yourselves.

02:48.426 --> 02:50.811
So I know you think thinking is cheating, so...

02:51.777 --> 02:53.953
I'm sure you think the same thing.

03:10.955 --> 03:13.603
Just be fucking truthful about your feelings!

03:13.635 --> 03:15.921
It's obviously out of your control.

03:15.955 --> 03:17.463
I'm not gonna accept that.

03:18.277 --> 03:21.050
You have to accept it.
You can't...

03:21.917 --> 03:24.562
All the military training in the world doesn't,

03:25.028 --> 03:27.681
you know, help you control feelings. You can't...

03:27.716 --> 03:30.673
I'm giving you a chance here to just be honest with me.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.672
Just tell me...
Okay. Yeah.

03:34.887 --> 03:35.911
It's true.

03:41.976 --> 03:44.461
And I'm only speaking for myself, but

03:45.817 --> 03:48.931
yeah, I think I have fallen in love with Tasha.

03:56.567 --> 03:57.802
So there it is.

04:10.336 --> 04:11.503
Thank you.

04:13.637 --> 04:15.363
And fuck you!

04:15.398 --> 04:17.442
God, I'm so sorry, Alice.

04:17.486 --> 04:19.130
Fuck you!
You gotta believe me,

04:19.165 --> 04:21.810
this is the last thing I ever wanted to happen.

04:22.407 --> 04:25.670
First and for most, I have so much respect for both of you.

04:25.706 --> 04:27.643
And for your relationship.

04:27.687 --> 04:30.371
And I cherish this friendship.
Plus,

04:30.407 --> 04:31.621
I don't even

04:32.087 --> 04:34.303
think Tasha...

04:34.348 --> 04:35.962
Oh, she does.

04:41.055 --> 04:42.711
Go! You're free.

04:42.758 --> 04:45.363
No, no, no, God. Please, do not break up because of me.

04:45.405 --> 04:46.601
We're not.

04:46.648 --> 04:48.250
Don't do this.
When we have sex,

04:48.297 --> 04:49.440
I don't close my eyes

04:49.475 --> 04:51.630
and imagine someone else naked in the shower.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.193
Fuck you.
Oh... you guys, please, please, don't...

04:54.248 --> 04:56.573
You love each other.
Just get me out of the equation

04:56.617 --> 04:58.160
and everything will go back to the way it is.

04:58.208 --> 05:01.461
Would you please shut the fuck up, please? Just shut the fuck up!

05:03.338 --> 05:06.090
You... wow, you guys should just, you should give it a try.

05:06.406 --> 05:07.763
It's a great idea.
Try what?

05:07.767 --> 05:10.790
What the fuck does that mean?
Just fucking try it! Just...

05:13.555 --> 05:15.791
If you don't call me at five', the same time tomorrow,

05:15.858 --> 05:18.400
I'll know you, you made up your mind about

05:18.887 --> 05:20.621
what it is you want.

05:21.725 --> 05:25.090
This is not... this has never happened to me before.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.420
Alice, you know that I live a life of honor and duty.

05:30.105 --> 05:33.221
I don't want you to stay with me out of a sense of duty.

05:33.257 --> 05:36.063
Don't stay with me because it's the right thing to do.

05:38.496 --> 05:39.993
Save it! Shut up!

05:51.366 --> 05:53.830
The only person that I ever really loved

05:53.835 --> 05:56.062
as much as Tasha was Dana.

05:57.538 --> 05:58.850
Dana Fairbanks?

06:00.715 --> 06:02.630
And Dana broke your heart as well.

06:05.576 --> 06:08.762
She broke my heart and then, she got sick.

06:22.418 --> 06:24.290
Jenny's here, so

06:24.916 --> 06:27.732
maybe we should continue this conversation later.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.793
We don't have to continue it at all.

06:29.835 --> 06:31.430
Don't be ridiculous.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.910
I was just upset,

06:32.955 --> 06:35.323
okay? I didn't expect to be kicked out of my sublet.

06:35.368 --> 06:37.680
And I just felt that you were expecting me

06:37.727 --> 06:39.812
to invite you to move in here with me.

06:50.515 --> 06:53.443
I wasn't angling for an invitation to move in with you.

06:53.475 --> 06:55.453
Nothing could have been further from my mind.

06:58.137 --> 07:00.620
Well, in that case, I'm sorry.

07:00.668 --> 07:02.270
But you know something?

07:02.585 --> 07:04.742
I would have said no if you had offered.

07:04.775 --> 07:06.313
But it would have been nice.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.142
So,

07:16.517 --> 07:18.081
what are you shooting?

07:19.895 --> 07:22.993
I'm shooting a tribute video to Bette and Tina.

07:23.036 --> 07:26.180
You know, I'm gonna do it for their goodbye party.

07:26.218 --> 07:28.411
It's just gonna be exciting.
So...

07:28.455 --> 07:31.512
Do I have to be on camera because, you know, I really hate that.

07:31.597 --> 07:33.082
I think it's a good idea.

07:33.126 --> 07:35.410
I mean, I would like to get everyone

07:35.447 --> 07:37.151
on camera.
It would be great if

07:37.188 --> 07:39.153
you would do something as well.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.501
Sure.
Great.

07:40.546 --> 07:41.922
Do you want a drink, Jenny?

07:43.066 --> 07:44.852
No, I don't think so.
I think it's a

07:44.888 --> 07:46.340
little early, for me.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.781
But thank you.

07:47.818 --> 07:49.691
It's never too early for a drink.

07:49.735 --> 07:50.982
I'll have one.

07:51.725 --> 07:52.740
So,

07:53.587 --> 07:56.160
tones of people have sent me tapes.

07:56.206 --> 07:57.322
Great.

07:57.365 --> 07:59.362
Who don't even live in L.A.

07:59.408 --> 08:00.872
for the tribute video. Okay,

08:00.898 --> 08:02.502
we should just start, right.

08:02.586 --> 08:05.070
Alright. But if you guys could just stand close together

08:05.086 --> 08:07.253
just so I can get the

08:07.287 --> 08:08.863
pool in the shot.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.810
And

08:11.845 --> 08:16.045
perhaps you could make a toast to Tina and Bette?

08:18.025 --> 08:19.723
To Tina and Bette.

08:19.764 --> 08:21.621
Oh, for crying out loud.

08:21.659 --> 08:23.520
Admit it. They were assholes.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.282
They were pretty hard to penetrate.

08:30.575 --> 08:31.803
You know, after,

08:33.066 --> 08:34.660
after a while I realized

08:34.696 --> 08:37.400
it's not that they're all total snobs, it's just they are

08:37.875 --> 08:39.111
insular.

08:39.688 --> 08:41.293
Tigh, kind of, you know?

08:43.217 --> 08:45.611
I'm not... as we've got to know each other,

08:46.945 --> 08:49.041
I realized they're pretty amazing people.

08:51.066 --> 08:52.272
Really special.

08:55.315 --> 08:56.841
I call them framily.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.131
More than friends, less than a family.

09:04.098 --> 09:05.931
I wouldn't really go up there if I were you.

09:05.976 --> 09:08.400
Why?
Because that railing is unsecured.

09:08.428 --> 09:10.402
Weezie said she'd come over tonight and fix it.

09:12.016 --> 09:15.070
Don't let Angie go near that.
That's dangerous.

09:15.108 --> 09:16.760
Don't worry, I won't.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.750
So,

09:19.507 --> 09:21.181
what are you two gonna do?

09:24.197 --> 09:26.153
Well, we've registered with two

09:26.195 --> 09:29.360
adoption agencies that are experiencing same sex

09:29.395 --> 09:30.963
adoptions and uh,

09:32.237 --> 09:34.911
and we just wait for someone else to choose us.

09:34.958 --> 09:37.360
What about...?

09:42.556 --> 09:44.573
No!
Why not?

09:44.605 --> 09:46.483
What? Come on, it's,

09:46.526 --> 09:47.911
it's perfect.

09:48.577 --> 09:51.210
He has something that you guys want.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.861
We're not talking about fucking used cars, Kit.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.210
I mean, you know, and anyway, I think he's

09:56.725 --> 09:59.640
coming to terms with the situation. I think he's

09:59.675 --> 10:01.511
ready to be a father.

10:09.095 --> 10:12.062
Well, let me ask you something else.

10:13.075 --> 10:14.153
What?

10:15.556 --> 10:18.421
What's the deal with you guys just suddenly up and

10:18.466 --> 10:20.600
wanting to move to New York?
You know what the deal is.

10:20.636 --> 10:21.941
Tina has a new job.

10:21.985 --> 10:25.022
I know, but you just opened up a new gallery,

10:25.585 --> 10:27.480
that you put your heart and soul in,

10:27.518 --> 10:29.272
you have a new business partner, and a

10:29.308 --> 10:32.383
beautiful and newly remodeled home.

10:43.307 --> 10:45.372
Can I tell you something in confidence?

10:46.526 --> 10:47.843
Of course.

10:50.368 --> 10:53.970
I am so ready to get out of here. I am so

10:54.015 --> 10:57.203
tired of everyone being all up on everyone else's business.

10:57.267 --> 11:01.750
What business exactly do you want someone to get out of?

11:01.817 --> 11:03.691
I want Jenny Schecter to mind her own fucking business.

11:03.727 --> 11:04.943
That's what I want.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.323
Here's what happened.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.900
Kelly Wentworth made a pass at me.

11:16.548 --> 11:17.910
Remember the other night, after the opening,

11:17.946 --> 11:19.120
she came over here,

11:19.188 --> 11:21.860
uninvited, might I add, to celebrate and

11:23.176 --> 11:25.171
Jenny saw us through the window.

11:25.216 --> 11:27.972
What did she see?
What were you doing?

11:28.007 --> 11:30.112
Nothing! She didn't see anything.

11:30.928 --> 11:34.150
Kit, she didn't see anything, but I swear she's got some kind of

11:34.188 --> 11:37.723
fucking crazy idea that I'm having an affair with Kelly.

11:38.326 --> 11:41.261
And I swear, I'm not having an affair with Kelly.

11:43.597 --> 11:46.173
But see, an other problem is I didn't tell

11:46.216 --> 11:48.382
Tina that night that Kelly came over

11:48.427 --> 11:51.753
and, and if I tell her now, it just, it just becomes this whole

11:53.276 --> 11:55.120
mess. So,

11:56.297 --> 11:57.750
I haven't told her.

11:57.797 --> 12:00.401
Yeah, it's gonna be a mess that you didn't tell Tina

12:00.436 --> 12:01.910
that Kelly made a pass at you.

12:01.965 --> 12:04.042
And now Jenny's on this fucking delusional power trip

12:04.076 --> 12:06.022
and she wants me to confess to Tina.

12:08.087 --> 12:11.450
So, but, is that why you wanna go to New York?

12:11.496 --> 12:12.852
I wanna go to New York

12:12.895 --> 12:15.011
because I think it would be a good move for us.

12:15.577 --> 12:17.393
However, I am happy

12:17.488 --> 12:19.142
to be getting out of this little

12:19.178 --> 12:21.751
incestuous hot bed of

12:21.788 --> 12:24.282
lesbian interfucking connectedness.

12:24.317 --> 12:28.973
You will never find a group of people who

12:29.646 --> 12:31.172
love

12:31.218 --> 12:32.782
one another more

12:33.475 --> 12:35.962
and who look after one another

12:36.048 --> 12:38.381
as lovingly as these friends do.

12:38.415 --> 12:40.320
You can give me any army,

12:40.727 --> 12:44.213
assembly of God and I would put

12:44.248 --> 12:47.691
my posse up against them because they are so tight

12:47.735 --> 12:49.312
and fiercely loyal.

12:51.207 --> 12:52.831
I can't believe

12:52.866 --> 12:54.650
you told her to go have sex with this girl

12:54.685 --> 12:57.172
and then to let you know what she decides, Alice. That is

12:57.208 --> 12:58.482
fucking crazy.

12:58.517 --> 13:01.673
It's no more crazy than you not ending a relationship from hell

13:01.707 --> 13:03.160
'cause you think it will kill Jenny.

13:03.205 --> 13:04.491
Same thing.

13:04.537 --> 13:05.903
I think she's capable of it.

13:05.905 --> 13:07.342
And that would be a bad thing?

13:07.865 --> 13:09.431
You know you don't mean that.

13:10.065 --> 13:11.581
Maybe I don't.

13:12.217 --> 13:13.312
No, you don't.

13:17.015 --> 13:17.773
What?

13:19.526 --> 13:20.672
What?!

13:20.705 --> 13:22.703
I just, I don't understand

13:22.745 --> 13:24.870
when you became so honorbound.

13:26.065 --> 13:28.252
I mean, no offense but it's not like you've

13:28.296 --> 13:29.771
really been the most upstanding citizen

13:29.778 --> 13:31.511
when it comes to sexual fidelity.

13:32.316 --> 13:33.212
I know.

13:36.638 --> 13:38.733
Alright, let me try to explain this.

13:39.765 --> 13:40.540
Great.

13:41.307 --> 13:43.430
Please explain to me.

13:43.467 --> 13:45.053
I'm being serious.
I am too.

13:45.086 --> 13:46.283
I'm ready.

13:48.107 --> 13:49.000
I just...

13:51.075 --> 13:52.702
I feel responsible for her.

13:53.267 --> 13:56.582
It's like I've been entrusted with this lost child, in a way.

13:58.688 --> 14:00.540
And I was

14:00.575 --> 14:02.500
given this opportunity to be

14:03.786 --> 14:06.150
responsible for somebody else's feelings.

14:09.047 --> 14:10.222
What?

14:10.708 --> 14:13.601
Well, it's sick, number one.

14:14.136 --> 14:17.233
You don't get it. You don't listen.
You're not listenning to me.

14:17.276 --> 14:19.512
Out of all the people that you've been with,

14:20.517 --> 14:22.732
why are you picking Jenny for this?

14:22.776 --> 14:23.723
Like,

14:23.765 --> 14:25.613
the girl is not even talented,

14:25.656 --> 14:28.352
she's not even a nice person.
She's like a fraud.

14:29.197 --> 14:31.371
You know she stole my idea.
You know it.

14:31.408 --> 14:32.651
I don't know that.

14:33.128 --> 14:35.031
You know it because I told you!

14:35.066 --> 14:37.242
It is your word against hers.
It always has been.

14:37.285 --> 14:39.781
Oh my God, Shane! I can literally prove this to you.

14:39.827 --> 14:41.771
I have it on my computer.
I have the whole day.

14:41.816 --> 14:43.343
I have the treatment
on my computer.

14:43.385 --> 14:44.982
It's not about the treatment.
No, it's. I have...

14:45.547 --> 14:48.071
It's the same treatment that I was talking about.

14:48.108 --> 14:49.432
It's murder!
I don't care about your treatment!

14:49.438 --> 14:51.122
It has nothing to do with that!

14:51.168 --> 14:53.300
None of this has to do with her being an artist or

14:53.336 --> 14:55.883
or a good artist. It has nothing to do with that.

14:57.008 --> 14:58.541
Women drive me crazy.

15:00.825 --> 15:03.121
I fall in love with women,
but...

15:09.868 --> 15:11.600
If I was to walk away from this,

15:11.647 --> 15:14.120
I think she'd go off the deep end. I really do.

15:14.156 --> 15:15.553
So it is a choice.

15:15.588 --> 15:18.992
Between my happiness and hers.
That's how I see it.

15:20.058 --> 15:22.532
Yeah, I, I don't know when,
okay?

15:27.036 --> 15:29.823
Listen, I gotta go.
Okay. Bye.

15:34.056 --> 15:36.432
Oh god. I don't really feel like going to the movies tonight,

15:36.465 --> 15:37.800
do you?

15:37.848 --> 15:39.730
Who were you talking to just now?

15:41.255 --> 15:43.361
Nobody. Just a friend.

15:44.676 --> 15:46.462
A friend called nobody or...?

15:48.268 --> 15:50.733
Is this gonna end anytime soon or

15:50.778 --> 15:53.570
am I gonna be under suspicion for as long as we're together?

15:56.917 --> 15:59.161
I know it's a cliché, but

15:59.196 --> 16:00.562
being rich?

16:01.977 --> 16:03.372
It's a curse.

16:06.028 --> 16:07.782
You don't know what it's like,

16:08.705 --> 16:10.462
never know if anyone

16:10.495 --> 16:12.250
ever really cares for you

16:13.567 --> 16:16.122
or if they're just with you for the money.

16:25.348 --> 16:26.761
Dylan, don't just...

16:27.588 --> 16:28.972
Please!

16:29.926 --> 16:30.833
Listen!

16:35.797 --> 16:37.061
Look,

16:39.527 --> 16:41.660
I'm sorry, okay?

16:45.685 --> 16:47.023
I'll try to stop.

16:49.497 --> 16:50.681
That would be nice.

16:55.017 --> 16:56.111
Trust

16:57.755 --> 17:00.172
is hard for me.

17:02.528 --> 17:03.641
Always,

17:04.425 --> 17:05.800
always has been.

17:06.587 --> 17:08.702
I never really knew how to

17:08.734 --> 17:11.082
be with people before.

17:12.496 --> 17:13.672
You know, even,

17:13.704 --> 17:16.433
even when I was with Winnie, I just used to

17:17.007 --> 17:19.281
buy and sell people,

17:20.246 --> 17:22.010
expect them to serve me.

17:25.498 --> 17:26.752
Trust me.

17:50.646 --> 17:52.082
Do you trust me?

17:52.685 --> 17:55.153
Yeah, I do.
Yeah.

18:59.066 --> 19:00.870
<i>The reason why I was such a</i>

19:01.616 --> 19:02.890
<i>bitch</i>

19:02.928 --> 19:04.570
<i>when we first met</i>

19:04.606 --> 19:06.462
<i>was because my mother had always</i>

19:07.115 --> 19:10.001
<i>spoken about you with such great admiration.</i>

19:12.085 --> 19:13.961
<i>You were the daughter I could never be.</i>

19:15.067 --> 19:18.170
<i>The woman I would always have to measure up against.</i>

19:20.595 --> 19:24.010
<i>Oh, Bette, I'll miss you so much.</i>

19:24.058 --> 19:27.000
<i>I'll never forget the fist time I saw you at C.U.</i>

19:27.096 --> 19:30.000
<i>It was a lecture and you were one of the penalists.</i>

19:30.046 --> 19:32.200
<i>You looked so hot in your powersuit.</i>

19:32.298 --> 19:34.001
<i>And I'm gonna miss double billing you, ladies.</i>

19:34.038 --> 19:36.071
<i>My business is really gonna take a hit.</i>

19:38.137 --> 19:39.821
<i>Oh, we'll miss you.</i>

19:52.116 --> 19:53.211
Oh God!

20:00.567 --> 20:02.190
Oh my God!

20:07.375 --> 20:09.670
Oh my God! We, we should get Weezie

20:09.706 --> 20:11.373
to have fix the railing before these people

20:11.405 --> 20:12.820
come over to the house.

20:14.705 --> 20:16.353
What did you just say?

20:18.666 --> 20:20.962
I said, "Oh my God".

20:20.996 --> 20:22.163
That was

20:22.196 --> 20:23.800
the most intense

20:24.587 --> 20:27.143
orgasm I have ever had.

20:28.366 --> 20:30.371
And I think you deserve one of the same.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.391
Just kiss me.

20:41.055 --> 20:42.531
I was kissing you.
I know.

20:42.565 --> 20:44.122
But kiss me like this.

21:07.895 --> 21:09.112
You know what I'd like to do

21:09.147 --> 21:10.802
when we get to New York?

21:11.565 --> 21:12.963
What?

21:15.386 --> 21:16.963
I'd like to marry you.

21:19.146 --> 21:20.591
Really?

21:20.627 --> 21:22.482
Yeah, really.

22:06.037 --> 22:07.543
Tell me about Tina.

22:08.595 --> 22:09.820
She's the love of my life.

22:26.407 --> 22:28.050
What are you doing out so early?

22:28.946 --> 22:29.991
Going home?

22:32.547 --> 22:34.443
I can't believe this is finished.
It looks incredible.

22:34.486 --> 22:36.731
Nice touch. Uh, not quite.

22:36.765 --> 22:38.253
Yeah, Wizzie's gonna come

22:38.285 --> 22:39.903
and get fixed it for the party.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.670
What you guys have been doing?

22:48.978 --> 22:52.361
So, what? Did you spend the night in your studio?

22:52.407 --> 22:54.332
No, no, Jenny's using it.
I was just with Alice.

22:54.377 --> 22:56.702
With Alice?
Yeah. Yeah, she's uh...

22:57.545 --> 22:58.982
What can I say?
She's really upset about

22:59.048 --> 23:01.162
that whole thing with Tasha and that girl, Jamie.

23:01.177 --> 23:03.470
Oh, god, that was a disaster waiting to happen.

23:03.515 --> 23:04.973
Wait, wait, just wait a second.
Wait.

23:05.006 --> 23:06.383
So Jenny is using the studio?

23:06.415 --> 23:08.540
I thought it was supposed your photography studio?

23:08.577 --> 23:10.972
It is.
That Jenny gave to you as a gift

23:11.006 --> 23:13.403
so that you could have some place that was yours,

23:13.436 --> 23:14.652
and yours alone.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.693
Well, she's just, I mean, she just needed it.

23:18.737 --> 23:20.192
She's making, she's do...

23:20.225 --> 23:21.873
She's working on something.
It's important.

23:23.776 --> 23:26.460
It's gonna be good.
This is bullshit, Shane!

23:26.506 --> 23:28.533
You know what I think it is?
I think she needed

23:28.538 --> 23:30.353
to give you something so she could have something else

23:30.398 --> 23:31.881
to take away from you.

23:31.925 --> 23:36.042
Oh, come on, Bette. That's harsh.
Listen, I,

23:36.078 --> 23:38.210
I understand where you're coming from,

23:38.256 --> 23:40.220
I really do. I just, I...

23:40.256 --> 23:42.401
I'd like to think she's not that calculative.

23:42.456 --> 23:44.192
Yeah, I have to agree with Shane.

23:44.195 --> 23:46.211
And basically I think her heart's in the right place.

23:46.246 --> 23:47.633
Yeah, I think here heart's in the right place.

23:47.668 --> 23:49.442
I think she just misplaced her meds.

23:54.207 --> 23:57.460
I had this moment of jealousy

23:57.506 --> 24:00.130
with Kelly.
But it was only a moment.

24:00.175 --> 24:02.383
Kelly?
Kelly Wentworth.

24:02.415 --> 24:04.653
She was Bette's business partner.

24:05.285 --> 24:06.331
She's uh,

24:06.787 --> 24:08.850
you know, she's like a bombshell.

24:08.896 --> 24:11.023
Kinda vacant bombshell.

24:11.057 --> 24:14.733
Kit calls her a vixen, you know, like a real predator type.

24:39.516 --> 24:41.991
She still hasn't called which can only mean one thing.

24:42.448 --> 24:44.061
They're having like a sexcapade.

24:44.075 --> 24:46.451
Al, you can't keep doing this to yourself. It's crazy!

24:46.488 --> 24:48.242
I'm sure they have great sex.

24:48.286 --> 24:49.283
You know?

24:49.325 --> 24:50.892
They have so much in common.

24:50.928 --> 24:52.452
I'm sure they're like,

24:53.077 --> 24:54.821
"Do you like it when I touch you like that?

24:54.858 --> 24:56.700
'Cause I like it when you touch me like that"

24:56.775 --> 24:58.491
You know, that's what they're saying.

24:58.528 --> 25:00.722
Or "Oh my God!"

25:00.758 --> 25:03.083
"I can't believe your nipple don't get hard when I lick them

25:03.118 --> 25:04.982
'cause mine get hard when you lick mine!"

25:05.597 --> 25:07.930
You know, eventually, they should just stop having sex 'cause

25:07.965 --> 25:09.580
they're so the same.

25:09.615 --> 25:11.742
They could just masturbate, it would do the same thing.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.131
Alice, listen to me.

25:13.165 --> 25:14.932
I have to go get a present for Bette and Tina.

25:14.966 --> 25:16.220
I can pick you up, we could go to lunch,

25:16.265 --> 25:19.170
we could make it fun.
Oh my God! 140 calories?

25:19.207 --> 25:21.080
That's cruel.
Come on! You've gotta get out

25:21.116 --> 25:23.433
of that skanky house of yours anyway.
Okay, thank you.

25:23.477 --> 25:24.620
Yeah, that's fine.

25:30.538 --> 25:32.492
What?
What the fuck I'm gonna do?!

25:32.557 --> 25:34.140
Oh jesus!
Al, let me call you back.

25:35.026 --> 25:36.652
Alright. Call me though, okay?

25:38.055 --> 25:39.551
What's wrong? What happened?
I have to finish

25:39.617 --> 25:42.080
the tribute video by tonight.
I just got this phonecall.

25:42.126 --> 25:44.711
That three more people are sending in their tapes,

25:44.745 --> 25:47.213
which I need to pick up by Fedex by noon

25:47.216 --> 25:49.612
or whatever the fuck the time is, and then digitize it,

25:49.645 --> 25:51.012
then I have to,

25:51.046 --> 25:52.312
I have to go to the grove,

25:52.355 --> 25:53.400
I have to

25:53.448 --> 25:55.350
get the editing software

25:55.385 --> 25:57.540
and then I have to go to Zoolop...
Alright, Jen, shh, shh, shh.

25:57.586 --> 26:00.403
Please, please, please, listen.
Listen, listen to me.

26:00.436 --> 26:02.142
I'll go to Max Store for you.

26:03.536 --> 26:05.243
And I'll go to Zoolop as well.

26:05.326 --> 26:06.632
You go to Fedex,

26:07.757 --> 26:09.330
I'll meet you at the studio.

26:09.376 --> 26:10.770
Problem solved.

26:10.808 --> 26:13.180
What do you think?
She understands me, doesn't she?

26:14.785 --> 26:16.551
Oh, that was great, wasn't it?

26:19.055 --> 26:22.331
We had the best time.
Did you?

26:23.386 --> 26:24.872
What did you see at the zoo?

26:24.918 --> 26:26.832
Fun giraffe.
You did?

26:26.867 --> 26:29.660
Oh, yeah, we saw an old giraffe with a goiter on his neck.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.850
Really?
Yeah, we saw baby lions,

26:31.947 --> 26:35.293
and rhinoceroses...
That sounds like you had so much fun.

26:35.345 --> 26:37.392
Let's go wash up.
Mama B. made you dinner.

26:37.485 --> 26:38.761
Do you mind if I use your bathroom to change?

26:38.866 --> 26:40.003
I'm gonna be late for work.

26:40.046 --> 26:41.593
Oh, you're not going to our party?

26:41.637 --> 26:43.992
Oh no, my man has to go to work.

26:44.038 --> 26:45.382
He's got to be at the club.

26:45.418 --> 26:47.462
There's a power room down the hall.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.770
Just right around the corner.
Oh, you know what, it's tiny.

26:49.808 --> 26:52.892
You should go upstairs and use our fabulous new bathroom.

26:53.915 --> 26:55.723
Alright. Thank you.

26:59.697 --> 27:03.000
The powder room is too tiny.
He's really big.

27:03.868 --> 27:05.982
Hey, he won't make a mess.
He's the,

27:06.018 --> 27:08.562
the neatest and the cleanest man I know.

27:08.585 --> 27:09.583
That's fine.

27:10.178 --> 27:11.351
However,

27:11.916 --> 27:13.300
he's still a man.

27:14.145 --> 27:15.620
And you're saying...?

27:15.665 --> 27:17.413
Well, I just, you know, what if he

27:17.447 --> 27:20.003
forgets to put the toilet seat off or something?

27:20.565 --> 27:22.490
You're kidding me, right?

27:22.526 --> 27:24.451
No, I mean, I'm just not that crazy

27:24.525 --> 27:25.752
about the idea of some

27:26.178 --> 27:28.602
man in my beautiful new bathroom.

27:29.338 --> 27:31.662
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not a man hater!

27:31.708 --> 27:33.302
I don't have to!

27:33.345 --> 27:36.293
Oh my God!
There are just some facets of man-ness

27:36.328 --> 27:38.541
that just make me queasy, that's all.

27:38.548 --> 27:41.090
How do you put up with her?
Tell me. Somebody help me!

27:41.805 --> 27:43.532
He never pees in my bathroom.

27:43.566 --> 27:45.462
Nope, never.
Right? Ever.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.451
Where do you pee?
Powder room,

27:47.486 --> 27:48.293
right?

27:51.906 --> 27:53.731
Alright. So they didn't have pasta

27:53.778 --> 27:55.492
so I got you curry chicken.

27:55.556 --> 27:56.711
Final cut.

27:56.745 --> 27:58.082
Wow.

28:00.787 --> 28:02.842
What?
I don't know what I'd do without you.

28:02.878 --> 28:04.490
You'd manage, I'm sure.

28:04.536 --> 28:06.403
No, I would not.
I'd probably kill myself.

28:06.435 --> 28:09.071
Oh, stop!
I'm going to leave everything to you.

28:09.455 --> 28:10.913
You're my family.

28:12.278 --> 28:14.943
Do you wanna watch this amazing video with Carmen

28:14.986 --> 28:17.221
that I'm about to look at lunch? She's dancing.

28:17.267 --> 28:19.350
I can't. I have to go and get Bette and Tina's present.

28:19.396 --> 28:20.922
You don't want this to be from us?

28:22.246 --> 28:24.452
This is from you, alright?

28:24.485 --> 28:25.991
I'll see you later.

28:46.786 --> 28:49.673
Well, good luck in New York.
Oh, thanks, James.

28:50.155 --> 28:51.952
Have you ever thought about moving to New York?

28:51.998 --> 28:54.171
No, not really.

28:54.215 --> 28:55.472
Yeah, well,

28:55.508 --> 28:56.893
maybe you should

28:56.936 --> 28:58.543
come work for Bette.

28:58.587 --> 29:00.222
She hasn't offered me a job.

29:00.508 --> 29:02.962
Well, that's because I don't have a job to offer, but

29:02.995 --> 29:05.051
I don't know, as if right now, I don't

29:05.097 --> 29:08.343
know that I ever would.
I'm sort of liking the idea of Tina

29:08.378 --> 29:09.802
supporting me and

29:09.835 --> 29:11.471
me looking after the children.

29:15.157 --> 29:16.653
Why is that so funny?

29:18.067 --> 29:19.870
Happy party, ladies.

29:21.267 --> 29:23.410
Bye, pumpkin.
Bye, daddy.

29:25.068 --> 29:26.241
Sorry.

29:27.947 --> 29:30.523
Hey, you know what?
It's perfectly natural,

29:30.566 --> 29:31.713
don't worry about it.

29:31.745 --> 29:33.432
Alright, so see you.

29:33.737 --> 29:35.970
So, I see you later, beautiful?
Yes, you will,

29:36.005 --> 29:36.901
beautiful.

29:39.237 --> 29:40.832
Oh yes, you will.

29:45.318 --> 29:46.290
Maybe they're like

29:46.328 --> 29:48.922
"Oh my god, you're serious? I like orgasms, too"

29:52.296 --> 29:54.691
I don't know what time.
No. Are you,

29:54.726 --> 29:57.740
did you get a gift or are you guys part of that video contigent?

29:57.787 --> 30:00.620
Well, we recorded a message, you know,

30:00.658 --> 30:03.720
"Best wishes Bette and Tina", that kind of thing. And you?

30:03.768 --> 30:05.461
Yeah, I had too.

30:05.508 --> 30:06.432
Although I'm sure Jenny

30:06.437 --> 30:08.232
will take credit for everything I said.

30:08.635 --> 30:11.273
No, I meant, 'cause Dylan was over at Jenny's studio,

30:11.318 --> 30:12.222
I mean,

30:12.268 --> 30:13.972
Shane's studio, excuse me.

30:14.015 --> 30:15.722
Tought that she was helping Jenny work.

30:15.727 --> 30:16.783
On the video.

30:17.466 --> 30:19.612
She's work... she's working on the video?

30:19.648 --> 30:22.252
Well, isn't she helping
Jenny edit?

30:23.566 --> 30:24.912
I don't know. Is she?

30:24.946 --> 30:27.270
Shane saw her there earlier, so

30:27.308 --> 30:29.763
we just figured she was helping her out.

30:29.805 --> 30:31.111
Well, actually, I first said that

30:31.147 --> 30:33.433
maybe they were having an affair and I was like "Yeahhh".

30:33.466 --> 30:35.501
But then I realized that would suck for you.

30:36.507 --> 30:39.741
Yeah, but Dylan's an editor, right? So,

30:39.777 --> 30:41.862
I thought maybe she was helping Jenny

30:42.276 --> 30:45.602
edit. I thought that's why she was ever at her studio.

30:45.637 --> 30:46.773
Shane's studio.

30:46.807 --> 30:48.791
Yeah, well, thanks for that.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.433
I need her not to know.

30:55.477 --> 30:58.882
And I just want you to promise me that you're not gonna tell her.

31:00.096 --> 31:02.590
No, you lied to me.
Now you're asking me to lie

31:02.686 --> 31:05.462
to cover you are lying.
I didn't lie to you.

31:05.508 --> 31:08.373
I confided in you.
No, you lied to me.

31:08.417 --> 31:10.410
You really did. And then after

31:10.457 --> 31:13.331
you promised that you'd come clean to her and you haven't done that.

31:14.096 --> 31:17.552
Because I know that she won't be able to let it go.

31:17.597 --> 31:20.903
Jenny, she has a huge problem with trust.

31:20.937 --> 31:23.190
Obviously she does. Are you surprised about that?

31:23.225 --> 31:24.093
Look,

31:25.016 --> 31:27.243
you had every reason to be suspicious

31:27.287 --> 31:28.711
when Nikki's manager called.

31:28.777 --> 31:30.753
Yeah, it was suspicious.

31:31.338 --> 31:33.530
I was suspicious because

31:33.546 --> 31:34.710
I recognized your voice

31:34.785 --> 31:37.771
because you did such a bad job in personnating her.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.591
Should I tell her that?
Just tell her the truth!

31:42.027 --> 31:44.231
It's better that way and then you're all even.

31:44.308 --> 31:46.320
She's not gonna think that we're even. Okay?

31:46.365 --> 31:49.521
When she finds out that I knew before I went into Hit

31:49.557 --> 31:51.480
that Nikki Stevens was a set up, she's gonna think I'm a...

31:51.525 --> 31:52.821
You're a liar!

31:55.896 --> 31:57.843
And a con artist!

31:58.306 --> 32:00.053
None of this bodes well

32:00.056 --> 32:03.492
for a relationship that should be based on trust.

32:03.535 --> 32:04.940
Helena, wait.

32:04.976 --> 32:07.100
Before you get really upset,

32:07.708 --> 32:10.041
now that everything is out in the open

32:10.088 --> 32:13.121
maybe you can...
So you knew

32:13.167 --> 32:14.362
all along

32:15.075 --> 32:17.052
that Nikki Stevens wasn't interested

32:17.058 --> 32:18.913
in you directing her movie?

32:18.947 --> 32:20.790
It was such a bad idea!

32:20.825 --> 32:22.332
This was so unethical!

32:22.428 --> 32:24.460
And I never should be involved in any of this.

32:24.507 --> 32:27.040
And when you stood firm

32:27.086 --> 32:29.480
and rejected the pass that she made at you

32:29.518 --> 32:32.612
that was just an act?
No, that was not just an act!

32:32.655 --> 32:36.170
And when she spilled the beans at Max's baby shower,

32:36.216 --> 32:38.270
she wasn't really spilling anything?!

32:38.367 --> 32:41.161
Jesus! That was such a good performance!

32:41.206 --> 32:43.283
You've been on the wrong side of the camera!

32:43.366 --> 32:44.541
Wait! Helena!

32:45.035 --> 32:48.283
That is not her fault. That's my fault.

32:49.747 --> 32:51.441
Fuck you, Schecter.

32:51.487 --> 32:54.541
You have interfered in my life enough now!

32:57.588 --> 32:59.843
You created this situation, not me!

32:59.886 --> 33:01.843
I'm not putting all on you, Dylan.

33:01.848 --> 33:04.732
We created this together.
Well now, I'm uncreating it!

33:04.748 --> 33:06.141
No! Listen to me.

33:06.178 --> 33:09.101
It's totally unfair.
I had no choice.

33:09.146 --> 33:11.021
Oh yeah?
How did you act that out?

33:11.058 --> 33:13.800
Because I wanted to be with you and you didn't trust me!

33:13.847 --> 33:15.741
Then I had to pass your test!

33:16.098 --> 33:18.942
I swear to you, I would have done the exact same thing

33:18.975 --> 33:21.593
with Nikki Stevens even if Jenny hadn't told me!

33:21.626 --> 33:23.950
I'm never gonna know that for sure, Dylan.

33:23.995 --> 33:25.410
How can I know that?

33:26.597 --> 33:28.582
Look, you can trust me.

33:34.468 --> 33:35.961
Dylan, I can't.

33:39.807 --> 33:42.151
Thanks to her, thanks to Jenny,

33:42.188 --> 33:43.741
fucking Schecter,

33:43.786 --> 33:45.351
I can't trust you.

34:15.047 --> 34:17.373
I thought so. Hi.
Hi.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.821
I'm gonna go say hi.

34:25.505 --> 34:27.350
How are you?
Hi, I'm good. How are you?

34:27.425 --> 34:29.771
I'm good. You look great.
Thanks, you too. You

34:29.804 --> 34:32.132
have a big bowl.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.172
Yeah, um... Bette and Tina, they're moving,

34:35.217 --> 34:37.900
they're moving to New York, so it's my present to that.

34:38.547 --> 34:39.592
Oh, that's, that's

34:39.637 --> 34:40.820
great

34:40.866 --> 34:41.891
for them.

34:44.226 --> 34:45.431
It is what is it.

34:46.425 --> 34:47.842
I think they'll be okay.

34:50.476 --> 34:52.232
So, I...
How are...

34:52.275 --> 34:53.862
No, sorry, go ahead.
No, no, no.

34:53.895 --> 34:55.161
I was just...
Okay, um...

34:55.206 --> 34:56.540
Go first, I'm sorry.

34:56.587 --> 34:59.053
No, I was just gonna say I heard about you and Jenny, that

34:59.698 --> 35:03.253
that's great and, I guess, that's surprising.

35:03.288 --> 35:05.893
After how upset she was with the whole Nikki thing,

35:05.938 --> 35:07.780
I would never have expected that.

35:07.828 --> 35:08.702
I mean,

35:08.735 --> 35:10.580
she seemed really upset

35:10.588 --> 35:12.052
the night that she told me about you and Nikki,

35:12.146 --> 35:15.083
so it was just to think of you guys together is kind of

35:15.787 --> 35:17.302
where did that come from, you know?

35:17.338 --> 35:19.573
I had this...
I'm sorry. What night?

35:20.085 --> 35:21.780
What night?
The night that I

35:21.807 --> 35:23.763
dropped off your jacket?

35:26.075 --> 35:28.291
Anyway, yeah, I just, I had this

35:28.336 --> 35:30.733
stupid idea, after what my mum did,

35:30.807 --> 35:32.743
that you were being selfless and you just dumped me

35:32.778 --> 35:34.953
because of the challenge that my mum put to you.

35:34.998 --> 35:36.080
Which was

35:36.508 --> 35:37.840
completely

35:38.957 --> 35:41.143
ridiculous and

35:41.825 --> 35:42.921
I thought,

35:42.967 --> 35:44.383
you know, that you were just trying to

35:44.426 --> 35:45.540
protect me

35:46.227 --> 35:48.362
because you knew you would screw around on me, but,

35:48.405 --> 35:51.190
well, you already were screwing around on me. So...

35:51.238 --> 35:52.772
You know, I just, I wrote the letter

35:52.806 --> 35:55.850
because I wanted to say all this stuff and...

35:55.895 --> 35:57.533
I'm sorry. Wait.

36:00.716 --> 36:02.211
What letter are you talking about?

36:02.268 --> 36:03.632
The letter. It's in the pocket of the jacket

36:03.637 --> 36:05.100
that I gave to Jenny to give to you.

36:05.145 --> 36:07.153
But it doesn't matter.
I mean,

36:07.195 --> 36:10.480
I'm really okay, you don't owe me anything.

36:12.705 --> 36:14.961
At all. Really. So,

36:15.005 --> 36:17.523
you know, I felt for you like a million other girls

36:17.556 --> 36:20.002
and I fell apart like a million other girls, but really,

36:20.566 --> 36:22.291
you know, I didn't die,

36:22.338 --> 36:24.222
and I'm here and I'm

36:24.788 --> 36:26.122
okay.

36:27.318 --> 36:29.720
Good.
Yeah, I wish you and Jenny the best.

36:30.165 --> 36:31.352
Really.

36:38.358 --> 36:39.722
Can I help you?

36:41.107 --> 36:42.172
What?

36:42.917 --> 36:45.621
No, no, I'm gonna, I'm gonna comme back

36:46.038 --> 36:47.230
for that later.

36:52.686 --> 36:55.410
What the hell?
It's just fucking incredible!

36:58.076 --> 36:59.702
Hey, can I get you a drink?

37:01.347 --> 37:02.781
A Captain Morgan's and coke.

37:02.818 --> 37:04.633
Really?
It's my fourth of the day.

37:04.668 --> 37:05.802
Nice work.

37:05.846 --> 37:07.402
I started at 11 this morning.

37:07.445 --> 37:10.570
Oh, god, you go, girl.
This to you, Alice.

37:10.617 --> 37:12.181
Drinking my way through it.

37:13.475 --> 37:14.911
She still hasn't called?

37:17.327 --> 37:18.383
I'm sorry.

37:18.418 --> 37:19.613
Where is Dylan?

37:21.007 --> 37:22.330
Oh, maleficent.

37:22.366 --> 37:23.422
Lovely, Bette.

37:24.177 --> 37:26.291
I think of Jenny...
Here you go.

37:26.336 --> 37:29.861
as Kaly, the goddess of destruction.

37:29.895 --> 37:31.170
That's very generous of you.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.881
What did Jenny do?

37:35.048 --> 37:36.903
Whatever, it doesn't really matter now.

37:37.908 --> 37:39.263
Are they here?

37:39.295 --> 37:40.821
Not here yet?

37:41.847 --> 37:44.622
Maybe Shane threw a bucket of water on her and she melted.

37:47.587 --> 37:49.991
I think that's the first mean thing you've ever said.

37:50.027 --> 37:52.980
That's so on. Got it.
Very good. Very beautiful.

37:53.027 --> 37:55.451
She always saw me for who I am, you know?

37:56.758 --> 37:58.400
She helped me accept it.

37:59.007 --> 38:00.380
It's one of the most important things

38:00.387 --> 38:02.041
that's ever happened in my life.

38:02.255 --> 38:04.432
I never knew anyone who could

38:05.066 --> 38:07.900
see someone's inner desires and thoughts

38:07.936 --> 38:09.650
quite like Jenny.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.702
It's kind of scary actually.

38:14.437 --> 38:17.151
Okay. I have decided

38:17.197 --> 38:18.323
to

38:18.366 --> 38:19.840
make up with her

38:19.887 --> 38:21.022
this evening.

38:21.026 --> 38:23.053
For Shane's sake.
Really?

38:24.556 --> 38:25.571
Good for you.

38:28.547 --> 38:30.300
Let's all give it a try.

38:31.998 --> 38:33.260
Why not?

38:33.306 --> 38:35.552
Yeah. Come on, we can do it.
Like a mass.

38:35.595 --> 38:37.250
Yeah, here to Max.
Let's try.

38:44.086 --> 38:45.470
My friends are different.

38:54.548 --> 38:56.272
Especially Kit.

38:56.308 --> 38:57.721
What about Jenny?

39:02.505 --> 39:04.623
This is so beautiful.

39:04.665 --> 39:06.922
This is very fancy.

39:06.955 --> 39:09.570
I'm just, I need to close that door.

39:11.475 --> 39:14.130
I don't wanna ruin the surprise.

39:14.166 --> 39:15.040
Look!

39:15.598 --> 39:19.160
It's the video. Where is the, is that, that closes the blinds?

39:20.126 --> 39:22.793
Jenny, I have a bone to pick with you.

39:25.288 --> 39:27.731
I know, you know, this thing with Bette and Kelly.

39:27.767 --> 39:30.231
I mean, come on, you need to let it go.

39:30.268 --> 39:32.271
You know, Bette said nothing happened.

39:32.888 --> 39:36.710
Do you actually think that I want to hurt Bette and Tina?

39:36.798 --> 39:38.083
Then don't.

39:38.496 --> 39:40.860
I don't want to be involved in this.

39:40.896 --> 39:42.362
I can see

39:42.396 --> 39:44.643
that I'm making everybody uncomfortable.

39:45.377 --> 39:46.723
I can see that

39:46.767 --> 39:49.352
my friends don't wanna be around me anymore.

39:50.586 --> 39:53.240
That they want me to shut the fuck up and go away.

39:54.337 --> 39:56.323
I just wanna do the right thing.

39:57.058 --> 39:59.630
Well, Bette said that Kelly hit on her

39:59.667 --> 40:01.290
and she rejected it.

40:01.326 --> 40:03.110
It's not true!

40:03.916 --> 40:06.913
Do you have proof?
I'm not a liar!

40:07.706 --> 40:09.641
You don't have proof.
You got...

40:12.018 --> 40:13.442
I don't wanna show you.

40:17.066 --> 40:18.881
If you have proof,

40:20.845 --> 40:22.542
I want you to show me.

40:37.487 --> 40:39.141
You can press "play".

41:10.075 --> 41:11.560
Very complex,

41:15.577 --> 41:17.073
talented,

41:17.118 --> 41:19.100
self-destructive,

41:19.887 --> 41:23.073
sometimes very generous,

41:25.067 --> 41:26.903
but complicated, complex.

41:43.076 --> 41:44.401
Damnit!

43:20.095 --> 43:22.061
Tell us about the movie.

43:22.648 --> 43:23.781
What's it called?

43:23.815 --> 43:25.823
That was called "Les Girls".

43:25.828 --> 43:28.243
Or "Lez Girls".

43:29.045 --> 43:31.062
Everybody pronounced it differently.

43:31.097 --> 43:33.630
Hey, T, I'm gonna show everyone the master bedroom.

43:33.676 --> 43:36.471
When Shane and Jenny are here, send them up.

43:36.508 --> 43:38.730
Jenny is already here.
Oh, she is?

43:41.427 --> 43:42.711
Here, try this.

43:43.356 --> 43:44.462
That's good.

43:45.458 --> 43:47.673
Oh, be careful when you're up there, you guys,

43:47.717 --> 43:49.563
because our contractor bailed out on us

43:49.565 --> 43:51.850
and she didn't finish the railing, right?

43:51.878 --> 43:53.912
Yeah. I'm just gonna take them up there now.

44:02.566 --> 44:04.603
Wow, this is the coolest.

44:04.648 --> 44:06.651
I would spend my life in here.

44:07.457 --> 44:10.220
Alice has one of the biggest hearts of anybody I know.

44:11.908 --> 44:13.413
She takes risks.

44:13.455 --> 44:14.701
Risks?

44:16.668 --> 44:19.570
I can't believe you guys are not gonna get to enjoy this place.

44:20.296 --> 44:23.300
Well, we already have, actually.
Really?

44:30.067 --> 44:32.360
Can I talk to you for a minute?

44:32.397 --> 44:33.520
Sure.

44:33.526 --> 44:35.440
I'll be right downstairs.
Sure.

44:43.597 --> 44:45.722
The sheets are nice.
You think?

44:45.765 --> 44:48.131
I'm gonna get another drink.
Do you want one?

44:51.576 --> 44:53.710
Bette, Jenny

44:53.757 --> 44:55.281
has a video

44:55.315 --> 44:58.330
of you and Kelly.
What do you mean?

44:58.375 --> 45:00.193
From the opening or something?
Girl, come on, now.

45:00.237 --> 45:03.003
You know, I think you just fucked up. I think

45:03.006 --> 45:06.513
it'll just come back, it'll just so bite you in the ass.

45:06.537 --> 45:09.053
What are you talking about? I told you, Kelly came over,

45:09.086 --> 45:10.520
she was drunk and I said no.

45:10.558 --> 45:12.992
Girl, stop, stop! I saw it!

45:13.037 --> 45:17.063
Jenny showed me this video that she shot through your window,

45:17.108 --> 45:19.050
with your face between Kelly's legs!

45:19.086 --> 45:21.560
Come on! I saw it!
That's not possible! That's bullshit!

45:21.597 --> 45:24.062
You did it! Don't lie to me!
That's impossible!

45:30.828 --> 45:32.503
What's going on, Shane?
Where are you taking me?

45:32.536 --> 45:35.133
Why are you not at our party?
You just trust me, Tina?

45:39.506 --> 45:40.950
Where is everybody?

45:41.827 --> 45:42.860
I don't know.

45:42.898 --> 45:44.700
Don't I get to have a lawyer here?

45:45.138 --> 45:47.070
I don't know. You're entitled.

45:47.735 --> 45:48.752
I think that the reason that

45:48.835 --> 45:51.603
none of the others have asked for a lawyer is that, uh,

45:51.935 --> 45:54.491
well, they really trust one another.

45:55.596 --> 45:57.642
What do you mean they really trust one another?

45:57.685 --> 45:59.970
You know, I think that they feel that

46:00.665 --> 46:03.381
no one of them is going to say anything that would

46:03.426 --> 46:04.322
hurt

46:04.357 --> 46:05.912
the other.

46:06.417 --> 46:07.680
Now, they're very, very close

46:07.727 --> 46:09.962
and boy, they're looking up for one another.

46:15.597 --> 46:17.263
Really nice.
Guys?

46:18.856 --> 46:19.680
You guys?

46:23.288 --> 46:25.642
You guys, come to the media room

46:25.687 --> 46:27.643
because the videos that I made are about to start.

46:27.685 --> 46:30.410
So, it's gonna be about three hours long, so

46:30.446 --> 46:33.101
you should get started.
Where is Shane?

46:33.677 --> 46:34.971
I don't know.

46:36.068 --> 46:37.643
Have you seen Bette and Tina?

46:39.148 --> 46:41.211
Bette's up there.
Okay.

46:41.247 --> 46:44.203
I'm gonna go get Bette and Tina.
You guys should come...

46:44.207 --> 46:46.011
Oh, you're coming!
That's so great. Okay,

46:46.048 --> 46:48.101
I'll just go get Bette and Tina.

47:55.525 --> 47:57.691
It's beautiful here.
Look, I just want you

47:57.696 --> 47:59.183
to know something.

47:59.228 --> 48:01.760
My family and the life that I have worked

48:01.798 --> 48:06.111
so hard to rebuild for them means everything

48:06.148 --> 48:08.393
in the world for me.

48:09.746 --> 48:11.980
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do

48:13.148 --> 48:15.183
to preserve and protect them.

48:16.255 --> 48:19.401
I would never do anything to hurt your family, Bette.

48:21.016 --> 48:22.151
I love you.

48:24.518 --> 48:26.012
And I love Tina.

48:31.025 --> 48:32.862
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

48:34.788 --> 48:36.982
Because you know what, I don't really care

48:37.986 --> 48:40.170
if you think that I fucked Kelly.

48:40.206 --> 48:42.193
All I really care about

48:43.076 --> 48:44.771
is that you know

48:44.816 --> 48:46.913
that I will not

48:46.946 --> 48:52.010
abide anyone who threatens my family.

49:07.097 --> 49:09.011
Complex,

49:10.025 --> 49:11.530
complicated,

49:13.217 --> 49:17.142
talented, very talented and self-destructive,

49:19.317 --> 49:21.233
sometimes very generous,

49:24.535 --> 49:26.150
but complicated,

49:26.198 --> 49:27.782
complex.

49:29.035 --> 49:30.450
<i>I wish I could say the lone person</i>

49:30.485 --> 49:32.402
<i>that's so excited you guys are going to New York,</i>

49:32.465 --> 49:34.752
<i>congratulations, I wish you all the best.</i>

49:35.025 --> 49:37.901
<i>I'm sure, as always, whatever you take on</i>

49:37.938 --> 49:39.552
<i>is a challenge you're gonna completely...</i>

49:39.598 --> 49:42.343
How could do fucking do that to me?

49:42.896 --> 49:45.411
How would do fucking do that to me?

49:45.448 --> 49:48.571
I'm just gonna put her out of her fucking misery.

49:49.256 --> 49:51.781
<i>I wanna take this opportunity to thank you.</i>

49:51.826 --> 49:54.883
<i>Eventually you might have ended it up with that nutcase, Jenny.</i>

49:54.925 --> 49:56.950
<i>Ah ah, just kidding, Jenny. Come on,</i>

49:56.986 --> 49:58.740
<i>you know I love you.</i>

49:58.777 --> 50:00.201
<i>And</i>

50:00.238 --> 50:02.461
<i>I have to say it's really nice of you to do this.</i>

50:02.555 --> 50:03.762
<i>That's pretty cool.</i>

50:04.717 --> 50:06.080
<i>We'll miss you, guys.</i>

50:16.007 --> 50:18.141
I have to tell you something about Jenny.

50:21.748 --> 50:24.811
I have decided to forgive her, and

50:27.088 --> 50:28.753
to make peace with her.

50:30.237 --> 50:31.540
Why?

50:35.187 --> 50:38.963
I'm alone now and I need my friends and...

50:41.326 --> 50:42.973
You guys are gonna be together.

50:43.007 --> 50:44.000
It's...

50:44.035 --> 50:45.693
We're not together.

50:49.025 --> 50:51.320
I thought you said you couldn't break with her?

50:52.655 --> 50:53.950
That was then.

51:04.815 --> 51:06.171
What does this

51:07.196 --> 51:08.833
have to do with who killed Jenny?

51:08.875 --> 51:11.360
I don't understand, at all, these questions.

51:13.256 --> 51:15.560
So you think someone killed Jenny?

51:26.505 --> 51:29.073
I just was checking on Angie.
She seems to sleep.

51:29.848 --> 51:31.860
Oh, that's good. That's good.
I was upstairs.

51:31.896 --> 51:34.521
I got a sweater, I was cold.
Are you okay?

51:35.167 --> 51:36.792
Yeah, I'm fine. I, uh...

51:38.006 --> 51:40.012
I want to talk to you about something.

51:40.045 --> 51:41.352
And, uh,

51:41.397 --> 51:43.243
it's just I just don't know

51:43.247 --> 51:46.201
if...
Have you seen Jenny?

51:49.905 --> 51:50.911
Sorry.

51:51.348 --> 51:52.430
Are you okay?

51:53.478 --> 51:56.870
Yeah, I was just kinda cold.
I just want to go get my sweater.

51:58.086 --> 51:59.393
It's getting really cold.

52:01.088 --> 52:02.493
Guess what, you guys.

52:03.037 --> 52:05.142
I felt a kick for the first time today.

52:05.206 --> 52:06.772
Really?
Yeah.

52:07.196 --> 52:09.532
That's great.
Cool, huh? Congratulations.

52:09.577 --> 52:10.860
Thanks.
May I?

52:13.546 --> 52:15.450
It's great.
I guess that's my little baby.

52:17.698 --> 52:19.752
Congratulations.
Thanks. You seem good.

52:21.057 --> 52:23.352
Did you see Jenny out there?
No.

52:31.547 --> 52:34.923
<i>Bette and Tina, welcome to New York City. Come on!</i>

52:34.955 --> 52:36.643
<i>The party is waiting for you.</i>

52:38.735 --> 52:39.801
<i>You know.</i>

52:39.885 --> 52:42.061
<i>And the rest of you, I miss you,</i>

52:42.108 --> 52:44.600
<i>I love you so much. You guys have changed my life.</i>

52:44.645 --> 52:47.283
<i>I'll never forget any of you.</i>

52:47.328 --> 52:48.880
<i>Thanks so much and</i>

52:48.928 --> 52:50.483
<i>as Kit would say, continue to</i>

52:50.518 --> 52:53.101
<i>live the life you love and love the life you live.</i>

52:53.148 --> 52:54.251
<i>I certainly do.</i>

52:54.288 --> 52:55.930
<i>I'm getting married.
It's Ivan.</i>

52:57.938 --> 52:59.480
Look at that.

52:59.515 --> 53:00.640
<i>What can I say?</i>

53:01.256 --> 53:03.892
<i>Oh my God!
She's a champion surfer.</i>

53:04.415 --> 53:06.183
<i>I don't know. I hate water.</i>

53:06.758 --> 53:08.723
<i>He looks good.
But you know what, right?</i>

53:08.755 --> 53:10.120
<i>It's all about</i>

53:10.918 --> 53:11.923
<i>that.</i>

53:13.057 --> 53:15.673
Look, I have my guide as a parade of all my exes.

53:15.718 --> 53:17.133
<i>I'm gonna throw you a huge party</i>

53:17.175 --> 53:18.441
<i>and I do mean a huge party</i>

53:18.477 --> 53:20.883
<i>because you know I've got a very big place in New York.</i>

53:20.918 --> 53:24.601
<i>Five floors. So there will be room for all your exes.</i>

53:34.026 --> 53:38.312
<i>Mama Mia, you're going to New York? The Big Apple?</i>

53:40.086 --> 53:41.792
<i>Where is she?
What can I say?</i>

53:41.856 --> 53:44.790
I think she's in the south of France since fall.

53:44.875 --> 53:46.311
How did Jenny got that?

53:46.356 --> 53:48.542
I think she probably just sent it to Jenny.

53:48.998 --> 53:51.322
<i>I hope that what you're gonna do...</i>

53:51.356 --> 53:52.921
<i>Where is Jenny?
... is gonna go to New York.</i>

53:52.958 --> 53:55.283
Last time I saw her she was looking after you.

53:55.327 --> 53:57.491
Well, she still isn't back yet.

54:02.958 --> 54:05.402
<i>All the times you were there...
Oh, wow, look, it's Carmen.</i>

54:05.437 --> 54:07.423
<i>And I wish you nothing but</i>

54:07.468 --> 54:09.770
<i>success and happiness and joy and...</i>

54:09.835 --> 54:11.203
I love Carmen.

54:11.845 --> 54:14.291
<i>Everything that this world has to offer</i>

54:15.807 --> 54:17.831
<i>because God knows you deserve it.</i>

54:17.876 --> 54:19.751
I can't believe she did that.

54:19.798 --> 54:22.612
Wow, Jenny went all out.
Shouldn't we pause it?

54:22.657 --> 54:24.450
'Cause I think Jenny wants to see her little action.

54:24.456 --> 54:25.992
<i>I think it from the bottom of my heart.</i>

54:28.598 --> 54:31.662
I'm supposed to be her friend tonight. I'll go get find her.

54:31.706 --> 54:32.971
<i>Yeah, you guys.
Come back.</i>

54:32.975 --> 54:34.672
I think we should pause it.
No, don't pause it.

54:36.036 --> 54:37.791
<i>I'm gonna miss you guys.</i>

54:37.826 --> 54:41.131
<i>Terribly so.
Thank you for everything.</i>

54:42.257 --> 54:43.971
<i>Oh yeah. And, um,</i>

54:45.727 --> 54:47.711
<i>you're gonna be in our hearts, I mean,</i>

54:47.746 --> 54:51.372
<i>we'll never disappear from you, we'll always be there.</i>

54:51.416 --> 54:52.670
<i>I'm always gonna hold</i>

54:52.676 --> 54:54.980
<i>this special place for you right here. So...</i>

54:55.076 --> 54:57.213
<i>It's so sweet.
Enjoy New York.</i>

54:57.587 --> 55:00.731
<i>What more can I say?
You're in our hearts.</i>

55:00.777 --> 55:04.482
<i>Everybody. Let's go and say 1, 2, 3, we love you Bette and Tina.</i>

55:04.526 --> 55:07.980
<i>Oh, you guys.
We love you, Bette and Tina!</i>

55:08.026 --> 55:11.230
<i>We're gonna miss you, Tina and Bette!</i>

55:12.907 --> 55:13.791
<i>That's it.</i>

55:30.917 --> 55:32.771
Fine, Bette and Tina,

55:33.337 --> 55:35.310
I love you guys.

55:53.846 --> 55:55.183
Tell me what we know.

56:04.418 --> 56:05.991
Any drugs and alcohol?

56:21.237 --> 56:24.111
Come on! Put your hands over you head!

56:27.905 --> 56:29.071
Nice and high.

56:31.688 --> 56:33.103
Here you go, sweetheart.

56:36.718 --> 56:38.451
Nikki, what are you doing here?

56:39.337 --> 56:41.510
I just, I, I, I came here to talk to Jenny.

56:41.558 --> 56:44.040
I saw what was going on at the dance marathon

56:44.078 --> 56:46.422
and I just saw the way that she was keeping you like a prisonner.

56:46.427 --> 56:47.480
So I just wanted to tell her

56:47.525 --> 56:50.380
that she had to free you...
Nikki, shut up. Nikki, shut up.

56:53.007 --> 56:53.903
Hold it!

56:54.588 --> 56:55.981
What's going on?
Sorry,

56:56.445 --> 56:57.791
you can't go in.
What's goi...

56:58.417 --> 56:59.430
Listen. I'm,

56:59.475 --> 57:01.511
I'm a police officer, well,

57:01.547 --> 57:03.242
I'm in the academy, okay?

57:03.278 --> 57:04.733
What's going on here, please?

57:09.906 --> 57:11.203
What are you doing here?

57:11.245 --> 57:12.661
Come here. Are you okay?

57:15.446 --> 57:17.070
I'm here. I'm here.

57:18.036 --> 57:19.990
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere.

57:25.748 --> 57:26.522
You know I'm afraid

57:26.526 --> 57:28.902
this is gonna take a bit longer than we thought.

57:29.977 --> 57:32.561
We'll do whatever you need for us to do.

57:33.037 --> 57:34.701
We'll cooperate with you.

57:35.877 --> 57:37.731
Yeah, we're a very tight-knit group.

57:37.775 --> 57:39.943
And we take care of each other.

57:41.018 --> 57:42.332
None of us did anything wrong

57:42.337 --> 57:43.720
and we don't know what happened out there.

57:43.756 --> 57:45.620
You probably just

57:45.665 --> 57:47.870
want us to come down to the station.

57:48.586 --> 57:51.263
Right?
Oh, that would be great.

57:54.377 --> 57:57.103
I'm just gonna go change my clothes. I'll call James.

58:00.348 --> 58:01.691
You're okay?
Yeah.

58:01.737 --> 58:03.101
You guys, um,

58:03.588 --> 58:05.662
you guys changed my life.

58:08.038 --> 58:09.803
Wow, you really did.

58:12.695 --> 58:15.723
And I'm, uh, I'm never gonna forget you.

58:16.255 --> 58:18.493
So I thank you for everything.

58:21.468 --> 58:22.452
That's it.
