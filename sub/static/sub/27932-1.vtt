WEBVTT

00:03.546 --> 00:05.965
And what do they call you?

00:07.508 --> 00:08.634
Mostly boy.

00:09.969 --> 00:11.345
And what do they call you?

00:15.683 --> 00:16.684
Fate.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.219
Neither can you bear fruit
unless you remain in Me.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.680
I think you've
partaken in enough vine.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.014
Away with you.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.684
I am a Son of thunder.

02:45.708 --> 02:46.667
His thunder!

02:48.127 --> 02:48.878
Ugh.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.457
I cannot tell if
he's drunk or mad.

03:09.481 --> 03:10.566
Maybe both.

03:11.442 --> 03:12.860
Smell their breath next time.

03:14.612 --> 03:15.404
It never lies.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.240
Again you slept
with the door open.

03:26.749 --> 03:30.604
Why must you scurry
about so loudly?

03:30.628 --> 03:32.564
Perhaps to make a point.

03:32.588 --> 03:35.692
Anybody could have
pilfered or worse in here?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.217
Yeah, well I'm not dead.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.180
Is the kingdom
sacked and looted?

03:43.849 --> 03:45.952
Sadly I can't tell.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.937
What happened once I
left you at the garden?

03:52.900 --> 03:53.960
That's right.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.152
I think I tried to cook.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.949
Take in this beautiful morning.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.010
Why?

04:02.034 --> 04:03.369
It lets light inside.

04:06.163 --> 04:09.935
No, it only allows those
thieves you worry about

04:09.959 --> 04:12.938
to peer inside freely.
Perhaps.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.065
I brought you your
favorite bread.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.382
It's fresh.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.362
And wine?
Later at the market.

04:20.386 --> 04:22.972
What am I supposed to
wash this bread down with?

04:23.973 --> 04:26.952
Squeezed grape.
Squeezed grapes?

04:26.976 --> 04:30.896
Think of it as wine
that is very, very weak.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.087
That stains.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.714
What did you say?
Nothing.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.466
I'm preparing your gear.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.968
My gear?

04:42.992 --> 04:43.826
What for?

04:45.911 --> 04:48.014
Training this afternoon.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.516
You have midday training.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.392
Training?

04:50.416 --> 04:51.893
Why?

04:51.917 --> 04:54.229
A required day of
training for all centurion.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.981
Why was I not told about this?

04:56.005 --> 04:58.733
I told you about this every day

04:58.757 --> 05:00.443
for the past three mornings.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.927
And I'm obligated to attend?

05:04.847 --> 05:06.015
Yes.

05:07.933 --> 05:08.934
A blind centurion?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.371
I should not be made to go.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.039
Your father would demand it.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.358
If not for his status
I'd be in no such position.

05:17.860 --> 05:21.256
It's our good fortune your
father does hold status.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.801
You earn a wage instead
of having to beg

05:24.825 --> 05:27.053
like all the other blind people.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.829
You are blessed.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.670
Getting slow, Crispus.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.256
Quick enough to best you.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.057
Who's the better
swordsman, Longinus?

05:49.308 --> 05:50.869
It sounds even.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.455
You're supposed to
say me, you blind fool.

05:53.479 --> 05:54.706
Vitus the great.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.291
Even blind he knows.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.025
I've always been
better with blades.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.534
A centurion always remains
focused on the task at hand.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.556
Sharon will not
accept your excuses.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.100
I can best you with a spear.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.144
Unfortunate for you
that's not what we're

06:16.168 --> 06:17.211
training you today.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.547
A centurion is
versed in all weapons.

06:23.926 --> 06:27.697
You feel confident, centurion
telling another soldier

06:27.721 --> 06:28.514
how to do battle?

06:29.473 --> 06:30.682
Draw your sword.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.228
You proved your point.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.313
I don't think I have.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.943
Now draw your sword.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.922
Defend yourself, centurion.

06:43.946 --> 06:44.905
That is an order.

06:46.990 --> 06:51.078
I will resume the rite of
Decemadio upon you, you coward!

06:58.460 --> 06:59.938
He's had enough, Vitus.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.272
I outrank you, Crispus.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.941
I will decide when
he has had enough.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.091
I'm fine.

07:07.928 --> 07:08.947
Again.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.156
Again!

07:16.562 --> 07:17.354
The one and all.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.083
He who does battle with us,

07:20.107 --> 07:23.086
he who sheds his blood with us,

07:23.110 --> 07:28.073
let it be known that this
blind fool represents us all.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.871
He should be able
to defend himself.

07:35.330 --> 07:39.501
He should want to be
like us, be one of us.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.690
We are only as strong
as our weakest link,

07:43.714 --> 07:48.677
and Longinus, you
are our weakest link.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.019
Less talk!

08:01.982 --> 08:03.025
I see.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.319
I speak the truth.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.323
One accidental swing of my sword

08:11.366 --> 08:13.202
and I can remove that weak link.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.894
Your status was not
earned like ours.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.794
You rode in on your
father's horse.

08:25.631 --> 08:30.028
If this were Sparta, you
would've been cast out.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.433
He's had enough!

08:39.144 --> 08:40.229
Get off me!

08:48.445 --> 08:50.256
I'm gonna remove
the weakest link!

09:07.589 --> 09:09.883
You will face
his father's wrath.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.641
Disgrace.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.916
Wine.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.669
I require more wine.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.295
Wine!

09:29.319 --> 09:30.463
I require more wine.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.238
Wine.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.741
I require wine!

09:39.204 --> 09:41.140
No wine for you.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.976
You've been assigned
to crowd duty

09:43.000 --> 09:45.877
under my command for this
afternoon's crucifixion.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.431
Give a blind man a spear

09:58.557 --> 10:00.350
and maybe the crowd
will fear him.

10:04.938 --> 10:05.814
Not likely.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.627
Raise him!

10:44.061 --> 10:47.248
This is your moment, my son.

10:47.272 --> 10:51.193
Remember what you have
learned in your weakness.

11:04.373 --> 11:05.374
Bleed him!

11:06.958 --> 11:07.751
Longinus.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.963
Perhaps you can strike a
target that isn't moving.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.093
I'd rather not.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.934
That was an order not a request.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.228
Bleed him.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.401
Closer.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.422
Closer!

11:36.446 --> 11:37.197
Now.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.325
Now.

13:00.030 --> 13:04.552
I take great, great satisfaction

13:04.576 --> 13:08.330
in knowing that in the
end I will be right there.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.668
I will be looking in your eyes.

13:24.262 --> 13:28.683
Then darkness just fell
and the rock shook of anger.

13:29.851 --> 13:30.644
Odd day.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.314
I don't find the
darkness odd anymore.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.462
But the ground shaking as if
Hades was opening his gates.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.463
I tell you that was odd.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.840
Yeah, but the ground moved

13:42.864 --> 13:44.991
just as the false
prophet was dying.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.704
You're acting it out?

13:52.082 --> 13:52.874
Yes.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.378
You know I cannot see you.

13:59.548 --> 14:02.360
Okay, so moving rocks, darkness.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.820
What are you proposing, that
he wasn't a false prophet?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.531
Of course he was.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.991
Let the followers
enjoy their sabbath.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.577
Their messiah is dead.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.455
Many today do not
believe him to be false.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.522
Fanatics.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.085
They say he will rise from
the dead on the third day.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.379
The only thing
that's gonna be rising

14:21.403 --> 14:23.238
is a putrid smell
from that tomb.

14:24.447 --> 14:28.427
Nobody returns from
across the River Styx.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.453
That's what they
would have you believe.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.040
You still have blood on you.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.419
Cease with your mothering!

14:39.379 --> 14:42.525
Speaking of mothers,
it was a sight today.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.319
Shall I remind you
again that I lack sight?

14:45.343 --> 14:47.238
His mother was at his feet.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.531
His mother should
have persuaded him

14:48.555 --> 14:50.265
to pursue his talents elsewhere.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.060
Vitus was cruel.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.790
He should not have
commanded you as he did.

14:57.814 --> 15:02.110
To have me poking
blindly at some poor soul.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.615
I could barely fulfill my duty.

15:09.117 --> 15:12.638
Perhaps he's right.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.496
He's right?

15:14.873 --> 15:16.851
A blind centurion?

15:16.875 --> 15:21.522
That would be like a mute
singer or a legless dancer.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.507
I'm sure many have thought
what Vitus has there to say.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.969
Have you ever spoken such
things about me, Crispus?

15:30.513 --> 15:31.806
Not in your presence.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.540
He's here.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.584
I can smell his fancy man oils.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.837
Were the events
of this glorious day

15:44.861 --> 15:46.738
not enough for either
of you two today?

15:48.323 --> 15:49.717
What's that fine
beauty that stands

15:49.741 --> 15:51.368
next to you, Vitus?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.305
I can smell her flowery
scent from here.

15:54.329 --> 15:58.267
This fine beauty, 'tis
pity you can't see her.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.728
I stand before you as a flower

16:00.752 --> 16:03.272
attracting busy little bees,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.858
while you two sit in
your wretched filth,

16:05.882 --> 16:08.527
attracting pesky little flies.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.613
Do you always
have to be so rude?

16:10.637 --> 16:12.514
Do you always have
to be so sensible?

16:15.266 --> 16:16.101
You're welcome.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.252
Those Christ
followers, they weep

16:25.276 --> 16:27.838
as they put his
body into the tomb.

16:27.862 --> 16:31.342
Centurion guards
standing outside far too

16:31.366 --> 16:33.052
respectful if you ask me.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.763
Gone are the glory days
where they would just

16:35.787 --> 16:38.206
feed his scraps to the dogs.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.602
Well, things have
thankfully changed.

16:41.626 --> 16:42.585
He will be forgotten

16:43.753 --> 16:47.274
as soon as the next
so-called Messiah arise.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.134
Ah, but until that day, Crispus,

16:50.969 --> 16:54.615
let us play on the
fame of this world.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.033
Attention, everyone.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.016
Attention!

16:58.518 --> 17:02.814
The prophet they call Christ
was put to death today.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.461
Let us honor the man that
delivered that death strike

17:07.484 --> 17:12.449
with his almighty
centurion spear,

17:13.282 --> 17:16.804
behold, the Christ slayer!

17:16.828 --> 17:19.013
Christ slayer!

17:19.038 --> 17:22.017
I would gladly
take the death spear.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.394
I cannot.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.462
That belongs to the centurion.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.233
Let us talk.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.551
You can start by
buying me some water.

17:49.027 --> 17:52.071
May I sit with you,
slayer of Christ?

17:55.116 --> 17:56.761
Don't call me that.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.453
Everyone is calling you that.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.791
Well, you're not everyone.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.001
Sit.

18:11.841 --> 18:15.136
But, I don't get
wages until next week.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.830
This night is for me.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.347
What sits so heavily
upon your sicking mind?

19:45.852 --> 19:46.644
A lion.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.332
A lion was approaching
me while I slept.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.835
Could you see in this dream?

19:52.859 --> 19:53.860
No.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.905
Well, it pounds my head.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.789
My brave centurion
bested by a hot drink.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.794
I like taking care of you.

20:13.212 --> 20:17.800
A novelty on occasion but
not as a duty, I assure you.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.531
The wine was flowing
freely last night.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.515
Everyone wanted to
buy the hero a drink.

20:25.642 --> 20:26.994
Me?

20:27.018 --> 20:27.769
No.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.040
I'm no hero.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.876
Last night, you
could have fooled me.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.836
Allow me to share.

20:35.860 --> 20:36.879
I will make another.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.529
No, I insist, take a sip.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.911
Do you not trust a blind man?

20:47.872 --> 20:49.123
I trust you

20:52.794 --> 20:53.795
very much.

20:58.716 --> 20:59.777
What are you doing?

20:59.801 --> 21:01.010
What?

21:08.643 --> 21:10.329
What's wrong?

21:10.353 --> 21:11.104
You.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.065
You, I behold you.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.859
Are you sure?

21:19.153 --> 21:19.946
Yes.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.800
I remembered sight.

21:22.824 --> 21:23.884
Can you see now?

21:23.908 --> 21:25.094
No.

21:25.118 --> 21:25.868
No.

21:28.538 --> 21:29.330
I did.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.352
You're beautiful.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.479
You're beautiful.

21:35.503 --> 21:36.838
How can this be?

21:42.719 --> 21:43.970
I don't know,

21:46.973 --> 21:47.890
but I saw you.

21:50.768 --> 21:51.936
Beautiful you.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.860
Your word, the sweetest
thing anyone's ever say to me.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.122
What brings you here
in your day of rest?

22:35.146 --> 22:36.290
That's what I told him.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.398
Silence, boy.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.447
I've been trying to
stay awake all day.

22:46.199 --> 22:47.450
I can feel those once.

22:51.454 --> 22:54.415
I am not going to throw
my lot in the fanatics.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.186
What happened?

22:57.210 --> 23:01.315
Today, people
have come in droves

23:01.339 --> 23:04.133
to pay their respects and pray.

23:07.261 --> 23:08.137
They look at me.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.077
I believe we've acted in error.

23:13.101 --> 23:14.453
We followed orders.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.788
And we will be judged for that.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.289
We'll be judged for
all of our actions.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.189
I fear for you.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.033
Boy, take me home.

23:30.034 --> 23:30.952
Beg his forgiveness.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.872
If he is who he says he was,

23:37.208 --> 23:39.210
I can't imagine what
lies ahead for you.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.011
I appreciate your concern.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.091
I can feel the sun fading.

24:30.052 --> 24:33.097
Can you see anything?

24:36.392 --> 24:37.185
No.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.166
Too Sabbaths have
been celebrated.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.983
One ends at sunset.

24:47.111 --> 24:50.090
You would think that
with this Jesus dead

24:50.114 --> 24:52.241
that some of these
activities would cease.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.621
I think with
everything that happened

24:57.872 --> 25:00.166
he'll be more powerful
in death than in life.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.127
Perhaps.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.007
You are part of that.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.719
I don't wish to be.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.389
You can't change that now.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.285
I'm done here

25:18.309 --> 25:20.228
Do you need anything else?

25:23.022 --> 25:23.814
No.

25:25.483 --> 25:26.609
Go enjoy your evening.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.780
Be gone with you, boy.

25:33.282 --> 25:37.036
I will return in the morning
with a fresh bread and wine.

26:32.133 --> 26:33.551
Not again, no.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.098
Oh, Albus.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.707
Since when did you
start knocking?

27:12.048 --> 27:14.675
And since when have you
started wearing perfumed oils?

27:15.843 --> 27:16.635
Good morning.

27:20.890 --> 27:21.807
Who is this?

27:23.893 --> 27:24.685
Mary,

27:26.354 --> 27:28.939
mother of the one they
called Jesus of Nazareth.

27:33.110 --> 27:33.903
May I come in?

27:39.367 --> 27:41.202
Yeah, yes, please.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.218
Thank you for saving me.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.223
It's quite unexpected

28:06.519 --> 28:07.478
as you can imagine.

28:09.397 --> 28:10.606
You are truly blind.

28:13.317 --> 28:14.110
Yes, I am.

28:15.528 --> 28:17.923
I'm sorry, I cannot
offer you anything.

28:17.947 --> 28:22.910
My boy hasn't dropped
off this morning's bread.

28:24.286 --> 28:27.289
I only want a
moment of your time.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.751
I'm terribly uncomfortable.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.380
It is because you feel.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.176
You ended my son's suffering.

28:42.263 --> 28:43.848
I did what I was ordered to do.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.727
You had compassion
etched upon your face.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.404
Why do you tremble?

29:00.656 --> 29:03.552
I've never, I
never felt this much.

29:03.576 --> 29:04.326
Guilt.

29:08.372 --> 29:09.415
Perhaps.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.474
Listen to me.

29:31.854 --> 29:32.938
I forgive you

29:35.691 --> 29:40.696
and I know He would
also forgive you.

29:48.370 --> 29:50.122
How can you say that?

29:54.043 --> 29:56.337
It was all meant to happen.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.299
I was pleased it was you.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.306
Hey, why is the door, oh.

30:08.516 --> 30:10.100
Oh, I didn't know
you had company.

30:11.977 --> 30:12.853
I must be going.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.399
We are preparing to
anoint His body today.

30:20.945 --> 30:21.820
Follow your heart.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.533
You are a good man.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.246
Peace be with you.

30:45.219 --> 30:46.387
Who was that?

30:48.013 --> 30:51.600
That was Mary, mother of Christ.

30:52.726 --> 30:53.727
What does she want?

30:56.438 --> 30:58.482
She came to forgive me.

31:01.735 --> 31:02.528
Really?

31:04.154 --> 31:08.510
She was happy.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.036
She was happy I was the one that

31:13.706 --> 31:15.040
killed her son.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.128
I've heard talk they may
be giving you a promotion.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.617
I'll be leaving the legion.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.327
Did you hear what
I've just said?

31:34.351 --> 31:37.330
You'll be given a higher
position and wage.

31:37.354 --> 31:40.149
I shall dictate a letter
and you shall put it forth.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.277
I beg you to think
about this action.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.990
Fetch me parchment and ink.

31:50.576 --> 31:51.761
Quick!

32:02.379 --> 32:05.507
It was decided
you should see this.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.680
If you wish to reply.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.098
You are a good man.

32:37.122 --> 32:37.873
No!

32:40.084 --> 32:42.002
I forgive you.

32:44.254 --> 32:47.341
And I know He would
also forgive you.

33:52.156 --> 33:55.534
Tear my soul like a
lion, dragging me away,

33:57.161 --> 33:59.496
while there is none to deliver.

34:01.957 --> 34:06.646
Pity for he has never
known the love of a mother.

34:14.762 --> 34:15.655
Father?

34:15.679 --> 34:17.014
May I enter?

34:19.391 --> 34:20.577
Yes.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.744
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

34:40.204 --> 34:41.621
I could wager.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.877
I can shout instructions
to a thousand men,

34:48.337 --> 34:52.216
but I cannot find the right
words for my only son.

34:53.717 --> 34:54.717
I understand.

34:55.969 --> 34:58.782
You've done all that you
could have done for me.

34:58.806 --> 35:02.702
An honorary centurion
status was not easy to arrange

35:02.726 --> 35:04.329
given your...
I know.

35:04.353 --> 35:07.540
And I do appreciate all
that you have done for me.

35:07.564 --> 35:10.001
Perhaps you'd like a seat
or something to drink?

35:10.025 --> 35:11.294
No.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.111
No, I'd rather stand.

35:15.906 --> 35:16.698
Father,

35:21.119 --> 35:22.579
this is not for me.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.916
It is time for me to move on.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.356
My weakness has
nothing to do with you.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.733
I should never have
left you in the care

35:33.757 --> 35:36.444
of those magi all
those years ago.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.988
No, they were great teachers.

35:39.012 --> 35:43.559
This was not Master Malkira's
fault nor is it yours.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.771
Where will you go,
what will you do?

35:48.564 --> 35:50.208
I worry about you.

35:50.232 --> 35:51.817
I will not always be here.

35:52.734 --> 35:53.944
I will be going home.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.214
Home?

35:56.238 --> 35:56.989
Yes.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.241
Mother.

36:00.868 --> 36:02.303
How will you travel?

36:02.327 --> 36:05.163
Don't worry, I had a good father

36:06.164 --> 36:07.708
who taught me how to survive.

36:08.750 --> 36:12.730
My son, the Christ slayer.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.298
Another undeserving title.

36:17.634 --> 36:20.905
It's the talk of the court.

36:20.929 --> 36:25.034
Perhaps with this fame
now might be an ideal time

36:25.058 --> 36:27.853
for you to step
down from service.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.749
You understand?

36:31.773 --> 36:33.775
I do understand

36:36.111 --> 36:41.116
and I can tell that you
have made up your mind.

36:42.618 --> 36:45.078
And like your father,
there's no change in that.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.334
Thank you.

36:58.258 --> 37:00.010
I'm so proud of you.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.476
I love you beyond words.

37:13.065 --> 37:14.500
Go.

37:14.524 --> 37:17.903
Go find happiness
wherever that might be.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.115
Till we meet again, father.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.304
A few more years
I have before me,

37:26.328 --> 37:28.914
after I'll likely
join you at home.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.628
Say hello to your mother for me.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.674
I miss her greatly.

37:59.987 --> 38:03.132
A peaceful day.

38:03.156 --> 38:04.992
The water relaxes me.

38:15.002 --> 38:17.814
I want to talk with
you about something.

38:17.838 --> 38:20.424
All right, speak your mind.

38:21.842 --> 38:23.987
I think what you
offer me is generous,

38:24.011 --> 38:25.512
but what if I wanna go with you?

38:27.973 --> 38:29.349
I cannot ask that of you.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.393
Not your people.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.646
You'd be an outcast.

38:36.273 --> 38:37.607
I am an orphan.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.318
You're my only people.

38:42.529 --> 38:43.780
I would go where you go.

38:46.158 --> 38:47.909
You'd have more
opportunities here.

38:49.411 --> 38:51.538
My best opportunity for
happiness is with you.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.460
You journey will be
much easier with me.

38:57.544 --> 38:58.336
You're blind.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.306
I shall consider it, Albus.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.310
The Christ slayer!

39:38.835 --> 39:40.354
Why?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.129
Why?

39:42.923 --> 39:44.966
Why would the one true God?

39:47.886 --> 39:48.988
Why?

39:49.012 --> 39:50.406
Why?

39:50.430 --> 39:51.866
Why?

39:51.890 --> 39:52.641
Why?

39:54.059 --> 39:55.977
Why would the one true God

39:57.270 --> 40:00.750
allow for His offspring
to be born onto this world

40:00.774 --> 40:03.127
as a man, huh?

40:03.151 --> 40:04.295
Why?

40:04.319 --> 40:05.028
Why me?

40:32.722 --> 40:34.117
That's what I thought.

41:08.508 --> 41:11.803
I think the price that you
have offered to me is fair.

41:14.514 --> 41:15.390
If you say so.

41:19.269 --> 41:24.274
The proceeds minus our
services to be dispersed

41:25.483 --> 41:27.319
in equal parts to
the three parts.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.113
Perfect.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.078
May I ask of you something?

41:40.040 --> 41:41.082
Surely.

41:42.792 --> 41:44.044
Jesus of Nazareth,

41:47.547 --> 41:48.423
do you know of Him?

41:53.094 --> 41:53.845
No, did you?

41:57.432 --> 41:58.183
Once.

42:01.186 --> 42:02.229
He forgives you.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.174
You've asked for my mark.

42:13.198 --> 42:13.990
But of course.

42:16.576 --> 42:17.369
There.

42:36.221 --> 42:38.265
This is a new beginning for you.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.270
Thank you for your time.

42:46.523 --> 42:47.691
Peace be with you.

42:48.650 --> 42:49.484
And to you.

42:51.027 --> 42:51.778
Thank you.

43:02.539 --> 43:03.290
Interesting.

43:05.292 --> 43:06.084
Is it?

43:09.170 --> 43:11.607
Longinus.
Crispus?

43:11.631 --> 43:12.733
What brings you here so early?

43:12.757 --> 43:14.318
Have you had any visitors?

43:14.342 --> 43:16.112
Yes, we have, why?

43:16.136 --> 43:17.095
You have.

43:17.971 --> 43:19.323
And?

43:19.347 --> 43:21.200
Have you've been
partaking in wine so early?

43:21.224 --> 43:22.493
No.

43:22.517 --> 43:26.163
Well, yes, hours
ago, but not now.

43:26.187 --> 43:28.207
You're not making any sense.

43:28.231 --> 43:30.251
Your visitor, Felix.

43:30.275 --> 43:31.168
Who?

43:31.192 --> 43:32.712
The Messiah.

43:32.736 --> 43:35.298
She was here too.

43:35.322 --> 43:36.340
She?

43:36.364 --> 43:39.719
Yes, the mother of
the so-called Messiah.

43:39.743 --> 43:41.161
Is this what this is all about?

43:42.704 --> 43:44.682
The followers of Jesus told
everybody that once in tomb,

43:44.706 --> 43:48.168
three days and three nights,
He would rise from the dead.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.230
She said nothing about this.

43:51.254 --> 43:52.005
He's gone.

43:53.256 --> 43:54.317
Who?

43:54.341 --> 43:56.384
Jesus from the tomb.

43:57.761 --> 44:00.614
Women came to perform
some Jewish ritual

44:00.638 --> 44:03.141
and then they move the
rock, Jesus was gone.

44:04.601 --> 44:06.895
We are trying to say His
followers stole the body, but.

44:08.438 --> 44:09.856
That's not what happened.

44:10.899 --> 44:11.691
No.

44:17.447 --> 44:18.239
Beware.

44:19.324 --> 44:21.284
If this Jesus has truly risen,

44:23.995 --> 44:25.598
He may seek revenge.

44:43.223 --> 44:46.160
Longinus!

44:46.184 --> 44:46.935
Longinus!

45:11.918 --> 45:13.938
I feel eyes upon me.

45:13.962 --> 45:15.171
They surely are.

45:17.841 --> 45:21.928
Keep your looks!

45:24.264 --> 45:25.223
Crispus is here.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.917
Why does everyone has issue?

45:34.941 --> 45:38.027
If I didn't know better,
I say they're afraid.

45:42.949 --> 45:44.301
Afraid of what?

45:44.325 --> 45:46.220
Perhaps this Jesus.

45:46.244 --> 45:48.705
Perhaps retribution
by His followers.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.502
I've had all I can
take of this place.

45:58.673 --> 45:59.632
We leave tonight.

46:02.302 --> 46:05.847
Tomorrow, I want to wake
up anyplace but here.

46:09.350 --> 46:10.393
Are you coming?

46:15.523 --> 46:17.400
Well, is it the wine?

46:22.197 --> 46:23.990
Did it happen again?

46:26.868 --> 46:28.429
What's going on with me?

46:28.453 --> 46:29.472
Blessing!

46:29.496 --> 46:31.372
Someone said they have
the curse of the Christ.

46:34.292 --> 46:35.210
The what?

46:36.336 --> 46:38.796
Drunk babble from fearful minds.

46:44.928 --> 46:48.348
First they hailed
me as Christ slayer,

46:50.350 --> 46:55.188
and now the accused one of
the inflicted Christ's curse?

46:58.733 --> 47:00.360
Another reason for me to leave.

47:02.779 --> 47:03.571
It's true?

47:05.323 --> 47:06.241
You're leaving?

47:11.371 --> 47:12.389
Yes.

47:12.413 --> 47:13.623
And what would
you want me to do?

47:14.582 --> 47:15.375
Stay?

47:16.960 --> 47:17.978
For what?

47:34.310 --> 47:35.395
This man, Felix,

47:42.318 --> 47:44.237
he's going to give you gift.

47:47.699 --> 47:48.491
A gift?

47:51.286 --> 47:53.413
Your friendship is
the best gift to me.

47:55.665 --> 47:58.167
You've made it easy for me.

48:06.509 --> 48:08.404
Goodbye, Leah.

48:35.705 --> 48:36.581
Is this my?

48:39.417 --> 48:40.460
Yes.

48:41.586 --> 48:42.920
Find happiness.

48:56.809 --> 48:58.519
You look after him.

48:59.646 --> 49:01.874
I'll do my very best.

49:01.898 --> 49:03.441
You're good for him.

49:05.693 --> 49:07.445
Albus!

49:18.706 --> 49:19.624
He really leaving.

49:21.042 --> 49:21.834
Yes.

49:23.628 --> 49:24.545
Perhaps that is best.

49:26.839 --> 49:29.676
Come, let me be your new friend.

50:27.066 --> 50:28.627
When you say we
are leaving in haste,

50:28.651 --> 50:29.962
you meant it?

50:29.986 --> 50:32.405
I cannot stand another
moment in that cesspool.

50:33.281 --> 50:34.031
And Leah?

50:35.491 --> 50:39.912
Leah, a beautiful
flower in a field of dung.

50:41.164 --> 50:41.914
Very poetic.

50:42.957 --> 50:44.459
I spit in her eye.

50:45.585 --> 50:46.294
Wine me.

50:57.013 --> 50:59.783
That lion will not make
me its plaything tonight.

50:59.807 --> 51:01.452
Huh?

51:01.476 --> 51:04.621
I could have sworn you
had your sight as we left.

51:04.645 --> 51:05.873
I did.

51:05.897 --> 51:07.106
I knew it will happen.

51:08.566 --> 51:09.692
I'm not sure.

51:11.444 --> 51:13.922
My sight came once that quickly.

51:13.946 --> 51:16.049
But that's twice, right?

51:16.073 --> 51:17.593
Yes.

51:17.617 --> 51:19.928
It sounds more like a
blessing than a curse.

51:19.952 --> 51:23.164
Perhaps we have good
travels ahead of us, Albus.

51:32.256 --> 51:34.401
Your coin, all of it!

51:34.425 --> 51:35.694
Away, thief.

51:35.718 --> 51:37.696
Leave the boy alone.

51:37.720 --> 51:39.448
Someone is a dead man.

51:57.323 --> 52:00.636
Forgive any quarrel
that we have upon this day.

52:00.660 --> 52:01.410
How?

52:02.662 --> 52:03.704
I don't.

52:11.462 --> 52:12.213
Forgive me.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.132
You'll ask, so you are.

52:27.019 --> 52:28.497
Did he fled?

52:28.521 --> 52:30.356
Your reputation likely saved us.

52:31.190 --> 52:31.983
The spear.

52:33.401 --> 52:34.962
He most likely recognized
I was formerly...

52:34.986 --> 52:36.463
A Christ Slayer!

52:36.487 --> 52:38.340
I think he recognized you

52:38.364 --> 52:41.134
and this man also
kindly helped us.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.636
Keep running!

52:42.660 --> 52:44.054
Yeah!

52:44.078 --> 52:46.515
Many thanks for your good deeds.

52:46.539 --> 52:49.518
And to whom do we owe
the appreciation to?

52:49.542 --> 52:51.711
I would not attempt
to lie to a centurion,

52:52.712 --> 52:55.274
but I also do not
wish to reveal myself.

52:55.298 --> 52:57.425
My help does not
require a recognition.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.028
How did you know
I was a centurion?

53:00.052 --> 53:03.556
Your marks of legion
and the centurion spear.

53:04.682 --> 53:06.535
Any holes in you, young man?

53:06.559 --> 53:07.911
No more than a scratch.

53:07.935 --> 53:08.686
Thanks to you.

53:11.314 --> 53:13.834
Do you travel
towards Alexandria?

53:13.858 --> 53:14.960
Near.

53:14.984 --> 53:16.360
We'll be avoiding the city.

53:17.570 --> 53:20.382
Perhaps for safety, we
could travel together.

53:20.406 --> 53:22.634
Again, that is up
to the centurion.

53:22.658 --> 53:23.868
I'm no longer a centurion.

53:25.202 --> 53:26.746
I wish to leave
that life behind.

53:28.456 --> 53:30.750
And if we are to give
each other false names,

53:33.085 --> 53:34.587
you should call me Cleopas.

53:35.463 --> 53:36.714
Very well, Cleopas.

53:37.798 --> 53:39.484
I want a name.

53:39.508 --> 53:40.259
Titus.

53:41.761 --> 53:42.553
Titus?

53:43.971 --> 53:44.764
Sure.

53:46.724 --> 53:47.516
And yours?

53:50.394 --> 53:51.830
Call me John.

53:51.854 --> 53:53.856
Gift of God, I like it.

53:54.774 --> 53:55.816
John.

53:59.320 --> 54:00.797
Are you an outlaw?

54:00.821 --> 54:01.572
To some.

54:02.406 --> 54:03.157
No longer.

54:07.578 --> 54:11.600
Cleopas, Titus
and John, three outlaws

54:11.624 --> 54:13.852
walking on the road to endless.

54:39.902 --> 54:41.529
Why has he not left?

54:43.990 --> 54:44.782
Only he knows.

54:47.827 --> 54:52.224
Upon His awakening, He
spoke to his womb mother

54:52.248 --> 54:55.626
and to His followers
why does He remain.

54:56.961 --> 54:58.546
The kingdom awaits.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.150
He'll depart for the kingdom

55:02.174 --> 55:03.634
when He deems Himself ready.

55:05.970 --> 55:09.807
I told you, life as
a man was not for Him.

55:12.685 --> 55:14.246
And He want the experience.

55:14.270 --> 55:17.898
To suffer and be
reduced by specs.

55:19.150 --> 55:21.777
He should have gone elsewhere
and started a new garden.

55:23.821 --> 55:24.864
It's brutal indeed.

55:26.949 --> 55:30.745
It's difficult to
watch and do nothing.

55:32.747 --> 55:33.956
I'm pleased He's returning.

55:35.166 --> 55:39.104
Ungrateful creations,
these mortals.

55:39.128 --> 55:42.274
Already they sing and
beg of His return.

55:42.298 --> 55:46.445
I would think after
His reception here,

55:46.469 --> 55:48.429
He would leave
mankind to their own.

55:49.305 --> 55:51.057
He has a deep love for them.

55:51.891 --> 55:53.910
Love?

55:53.934 --> 55:56.270
What is love when it's
not returned, Gabriel?

55:58.981 --> 55:59.982
Weakness.

56:00.983 --> 56:01.734
Is it?

56:04.278 --> 56:05.446
Is love devotion?

56:06.614 --> 56:08.032
Is love loyalty?

56:09.283 --> 56:12.054
Is love a willingness to
sacrifice life for another?

56:12.078 --> 56:15.081
Complex as these
beings are, they have

56:17.083 --> 56:20.771
not the delicate grace found
in the field of flowers.

56:20.795 --> 56:23.899
No divine scent that
lingers and a sweet breeze

56:23.923 --> 56:25.841
after a rain.

56:27.259 --> 56:32.115
No warmth or breath taking
brilliance from the sun

56:32.139 --> 56:34.284
setting over the
bluest of waters.

56:34.308 --> 56:39.081
I have seen beauty and
mankind is not beautiful.

56:43.067 --> 56:44.753
It's not in our hearts.

56:44.777 --> 56:45.986
Not in His ways.

56:47.321 --> 56:48.840
Perhaps His time here on earth

56:48.864 --> 56:52.076
has set in motion
certain changes.

56:54.495 --> 56:56.205
Wishful thinking, old friend.

56:58.249 --> 57:00.960
They will kill one another
to claim His words.

57:01.961 --> 57:06.024
Words they will further
pervert and distort

57:06.048 --> 57:07.776
to serve the agendas
of the ambitious,

57:07.800 --> 57:10.261
ambitious men seeking power.

57:12.096 --> 57:14.950
They will perform countless
sins against one another

57:14.974 --> 57:17.702
while building their
walls around what they see

57:17.726 --> 57:18.727
if they needed to be.

57:20.312 --> 57:21.397
Sounds familiar.

57:22.898 --> 57:25.818
Justification for
their sinful actions.

57:33.242 --> 57:36.078
When mankind has
all but turn to dust,

57:38.038 --> 57:39.999
beauty and peace
will reign again.

58:11.197 --> 58:12.531
You did not sleep.

58:14.200 --> 58:15.326
How did you do?

58:19.163 --> 58:20.497
Speak your mind through me.

58:23.167 --> 58:25.002
I don't care what you do to me.

58:27.963 --> 58:30.549
But I can't have
you harming the boy.

58:33.135 --> 58:34.696
You got the only weapon here.

58:34.720 --> 58:37.264
Sharp walking stick in
the hands of a blind man?

58:38.390 --> 58:39.725
Looks dangerous enough.

58:41.977 --> 58:44.230
Have you ever seen a
centurion spear up close?

58:47.816 --> 58:48.859
Once or twice.

58:49.735 --> 58:50.527
Symbol

58:53.322 --> 58:54.925
of our unified strength.

58:54.949 --> 58:57.451
Yes, but how much sorrow
and suffering has it brought?

59:00.037 --> 59:02.706
It's brought much peace and
order into a lawless land.

59:04.166 --> 59:05.918
How much peace and
order has it brought you?

59:32.236 --> 59:34.965
Forgive me, I've overslept.

59:34.989 --> 59:37.408
There in lies our new
found freedom, Albus.

59:38.450 --> 59:40.929
It's Titus.

59:40.953 --> 59:42.746
Now he know it's my real name.

59:43.956 --> 59:44.790
Titus,

59:46.792 --> 59:48.687
we are late for nothing.

59:48.711 --> 59:50.879
Simply here now.

59:54.591 --> 59:56.176
Good to see you here, John.

59:57.344 --> 59:58.780
Where would I be?

59:58.804 --> 01:00:01.324
Someone thought you'd
be gone by morning

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:03.618
with everything you could steal.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.954
Really?

01:00:05.978 --> 01:00:07.354
I owe you on that one.

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.317
It's a good wager, outlaw.

01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:14.236
Wouldn't use your real name.

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:19.217
I have to say that it
surprised me a bit.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.492
Mankind is so trusting.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.245
We've earned that reputation.

01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:32.105
I'm gonna suggest that
we travel off the road

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:33.339
to the Port of Cyrene.

01:00:34.882 --> 01:00:36.192
Interesting.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:37.819
No Alexandria?

01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:40.280
City second only to Rome?

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:41.656
No cities.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.075
Are you able
to travel the wilderness?

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:45.392
Listen to your words.

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:48.288
I was once a soldier.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:51.124
Marching was part
of my everyday life.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:52.459
I can handle the wilderness.

01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:55.110
The question is, can you?

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:56.987
I'll try.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.924
It could be days.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:00.783
I'll survive.

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:03.744
Say that I haven't warned you.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:06.723
What about navigation?

01:01:06.747 --> 01:01:09.601
That's a lot of faith
that you're putting in me.

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:13.313
You have such an
honest face, John.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:15.440
I life off the road.

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:17.692
No thieves and no murderers.

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:20.010
But the wilderness
is so much better.

01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:23.073
Lions, bears.

01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:25.950
Is there an animal
more dangerous than man?

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:26.725
I hope not.

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:45.136
I feel like we're being watched.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.412
We're always being watched.

01:02:13.147 --> 01:02:15.208
Do I travel with too much haste?

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:17.317
Your pace does not hinder us.

01:02:21.864 --> 01:02:22.656
Beautiful.

01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:25.468
The desert?

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.761
All of it.

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:28.972
Have you seen much of it?

01:02:28.996 --> 01:02:31.057
Fortunately yes.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.332
I wish to see more.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:36.170
Glorious sights to
behold are all around us.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:41.633
I'm not one to complain
about my circumstances,

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:44.928
but I cannot behold anything.

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:51.852
Perhaps water
would serve you better here?

01:02:53.145 --> 01:02:55.498
Away from me, boy!

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.333
I wanted to assist you.

01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:59.210
You didn't sleep.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.379
You must be exhausted.

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:06.092
Boy, you still treat
me like a frail flower.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.409
I'm not weak!

01:03:09.328 --> 01:03:11.347
Even the strong fall sometimes.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:12.581
Curse you, boy!

01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:15.459
Let me fall.

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:20.398
My whole life has been a fall!

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.647
It's hard to let those
that you love fall or fail.

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:39.858
But look where your
anger has taken you.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:42.629
I saw you!

01:03:42.653 --> 01:03:43.820
It happened again?

01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:47.950
Just for a moment,
but I saw you, John.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.619
Like the father I never had.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.163
That's how I love you.

01:03:54.373 --> 01:03:56.291
I would never accept
your unkind words.

01:03:57.376 --> 01:03:58.377
I know your heart.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.712
Strike me!

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:02.589
It is forgiven.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.444
No, you would make
me feel much better.

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:07.987
I insist.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.532
Best to just appease
him when he's like this.

01:04:10.556 --> 01:04:11.348
Strike me!

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:22.418
I truly do wish
to hear your thoughts

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:23.735
on this man Jesus.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.239
I believe this Jesus,

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:33.370
if divinely sent, brought
about change much too quickly.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.015
People are not ready.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.184
Will they ever be ready?

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.770
For what?
Invitation to return

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.296
to the kingdom of the Father?

01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:48.844
Fear of some final fiery
eternal death and damnation

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.599
will have many believe
that they are ready.

01:04:56.435 --> 01:04:59.789
I hope he's a god of
forgiveness and mercy.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:00.480
Why?

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:03.025
'Cause we're not worthy.

01:05:04.276 --> 01:05:06.695
If worthy is ready,
no one will ever be.

01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:11.509
Perhaps his sacrifice can atone

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:13.243
for the shortcomings of mankind?

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.455
Yes, but why?

01:05:17.873 --> 01:05:20.709
Why live a ruthless
despicable life

01:05:21.877 --> 01:05:23.962
only to find forgiveness
at the very end?

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:27.799
Is that the way, his way?

01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:31.029
They ask for forgiveness.

01:05:31.053 --> 01:05:33.698
I'm sure that it would be given.

01:05:33.722 --> 01:05:36.618
You think his death
is such a good thing?

01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:38.101
I don't believe it to be so.

01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:41.831
A Messiah ministry
is surely to grow

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:43.482
like a child without guidance.

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:47.712
Will they hunt us down?

01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:48.487
Surely not.

01:05:50.906 --> 01:05:55.470
John, how can you say
that with any certainty?

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:58.222
One can go about preaching
about love and peace

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:00.415
for those worse to fall
upon hateful hearts.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.312
Your faith in mankind
is heavily tainted.

01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:06.189
Tainted by truth, my friend.

01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:07.857
Mark my words.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.693
Many will die in His
name and many more

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:13.488
will kill in His name.

01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:14.763
And is that what He intended?

01:06:16.515 --> 01:06:19.601
What will they make of His
words a thousand years from now?

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.689
What will become of
his original teachings?

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:28.527
Quite worth considering.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.602
Peace be with you on this night.

01:08:07.626 --> 01:08:08.853
Peace be with you.

01:08:08.877 --> 01:08:11.731
We're told this vessel
can make it to Anaxeme?

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:12.839
You heard correct.

01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:16.359
Will you take payment
for your services?

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:17.135
Always.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:19.930
How many passengers?
Three.

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:25.745
I thought you had
to part ways here?

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:27.955
After hearing of
such a beautiful place,

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:29.689
I must see it myself.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:33.609
We'll pay half now
and half upon arrival.

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.339
What's your name?

01:08:36.363 --> 01:08:38.406
Old Salt is what we were given.

01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:42.511
I've gone by many names, sir.

01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:43.662
You can call me Salt.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.915
The Old part is
not so attractive.

01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:48.707
Very well.

01:08:49.835 --> 01:08:51.854
I'm Cleopas.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:54.714
This is Titus and John.
I see.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.716
We're all known by many names.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:02.573
The boat is stocked
and prepared to depart

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:03.640
if that's what you wish.

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:07.870
I'm exhausted.

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:10.706
Let us be off.
Agreed.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:11.898
Welcome aboard.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.719
My darkest corners
and sideways shadows

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:26.328
are illuminated by
your luminous light.

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:34.421
Get yourself settled and we'll
get this voyage underway.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.892
The lion will no
longer torment him.

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:56.818
Do not miss love.

01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:00.280
You know the power of it.

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:08.413
I think you are the
one way to His truth.

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:13.710
Enlightening him to love
as they experience it.

01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:18.941
The Almighty was very decisive

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:21.527
in the early days of creation.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.906
He commanded from a
place of great strength

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:26.848
and was easily displeased.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:32.163
He was quick to destroy
deviation, to create anew,

01:10:32.187 --> 01:10:34.564
but to him it was only rebirth.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:41.905
You died for their sins and
His impossible standard.

01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:44.699
Was it painful?

01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:48.244
Death?

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:50.997
Say it.

01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:54.376
What words do you wish to hear?

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:58.463
Declare I was right.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.819
Man is an unpredictable
creature.

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:05.279
No.

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:09.909
Man is always predictable
to be unpredictable.

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:12.143
Made in his image.
As are you.

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:20.944
Let me tell you a tale
I heard from a Greek sailor.

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:26.842
Zeus, favored son of the Titans,

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.535
thrice been fooled
by Prometheus.

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:34.833
Zeus demanded impossible
sacrifice made from each man.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:37.794
Prometheus refused.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:41.482
And how did Zeus react?

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:43.609
He ordered Prometheus dragged

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:44.986
to the distant mountains,

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:49.699
chained in a dark place where
pain was inflicted daily.

01:11:49.723 --> 01:11:52.868
What angered Zeus more
was that Prometheus

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:55.287
would not speak
the mother's name

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.480
whose child would dethrone Zeus.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:00.918
You wanna know the name?

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:01.943
Of whom?

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:05.488
The mother whose son
would dethrone Zeus?

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:09.284
Mary.

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.037
Her name is Mary.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.975
You're the child to dethrone God

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:18.477
with your newly
acquired insights.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:19.854
No.

01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:22.338
I will sit in honor beside Him.

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:25.842
The throne does not
empower my Father.

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:29.637
My Father empowers the throne.

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:02.754
Albus?

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:06.382
The sun of a new
day welcomes us.

01:13:21.773 --> 01:13:22.917
Where are we?

01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:24.835
Where's the boat?

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:26.003
Gone.

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:27.070
We've arrived.

01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:29.423
How?

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.533
You were exhausted and slept.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:33.493
Now you're here.

01:13:34.953 --> 01:13:36.806
Shall we get you home?

01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:38.331
I saw a path not far from here.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.214
What lies your family home?

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:51.553
If you travel west,
before the village,

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:54.990
look for the date trees.

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:56.307
Who resides there?

01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.310
Sabina.

01:14:01.146 --> 01:14:02.063
My father's sister.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.210
Will she be filled
with joy to see you

01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:08.611
after all these years?
Joy?

01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:12.240
As I remember she
was joyous to all.

01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:15.952
An overflowing bowl of sunshine.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.931
An overflowing bowl of sunshine

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:21.642
sounds exactly
like what you need.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.323
Hold right there.

01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:37.265
Who approaches?

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:39.559
Bowl of sunshine?

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:41.269
It's me.

01:14:42.312 --> 01:14:43.396
It's Longinus.

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:47.108
Hadrian's boy?

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:49.319
One and the same.

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:51.821
Is that you, Sabina?

01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:54.717
Forgive me!

01:15:01.206 --> 01:15:03.082
These eyes aren't
what they once were.

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:05.501
That makes the two of us.

01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:12.133
I so wish I could've helped you.

01:15:14.886 --> 01:15:15.678
The best have tried.

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:21.100
Come, come.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:25.855
Are you gonna tell her?

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:29.335
Mind your tongue and
manners, we just arrived.

01:15:29.359 --> 01:15:30.669
And who is this handsome man?

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.171
Titus.

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:34.072
And this is John.
Welcome, John.

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:36.050
Titus.

01:15:36.074 --> 01:15:38.177
Titus is too formal.

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:39.911
Why don't you
address me as Albus?

01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:43.057
Welcome, Albus.

01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:44.850
Thank you for your kindness.

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:46.626
Well, let's get
you all cleaned up.

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:48.771
Who's hungry?

01:15:48.795 --> 01:15:49.629
I am.

01:15:51.256 --> 01:15:52.048
Come this way.

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:09.023
Your dwelling is so peaceful.

01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:11.567
Yours to enjoy.

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:14.713
He told you how we're blood.

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:17.091
Your brother is his father.
Yes.

01:16:17.115 --> 01:16:18.717
He's a great man.

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:20.427
A great warrior.

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:22.221
Is he now?

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:23.264
Mm-hmm.

01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:25.349
He's met the Emperor.

01:16:25.373 --> 01:16:28.143
Did he grew up here?
The early years.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:31.021
When his father was
assigned, he was sent off.

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:31.796
Where?

01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:36.301
Our grandfather is a part of
a priestly order to the east.

01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:40.447
He was sent there for
keeping and education.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:42.283
Is she putting you
to sleep with our

01:16:42.307 --> 01:16:44.201
entire family history?

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:45.369
Stop.

01:16:45.393 --> 01:16:47.228
I'm proud of our history.

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:52.376
I have cleaned clothes for bed.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.151
If you follow me.

01:16:58.865 --> 01:17:00.592
Wait until she finds
out the Christ Slayer

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:03.202
is part of our proud
family history.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.048
Does it fit?

01:17:20.178 --> 01:17:21.929
I wish you all could've met him.

01:17:24.432 --> 01:17:25.224
Daniel.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.186
A hearty laugh.

01:17:29.354 --> 01:17:30.605
The best smile

01:17:32.023 --> 01:17:33.358
and a heart like a bear.

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:36.277
Those are fond memories.

01:17:37.487 --> 01:17:39.673
He now dwells in a better place.

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:40.907
Surely he does.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.387
What would you have
me do with these?

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:46.680
To me.

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:48.182
Go eat.

01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:48.956
Go.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:16.776
They're healthy.

01:18:18.236 --> 01:18:20.321
Popular amongst the
village and beyond.

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:23.199
Beautiful creation.

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:26.369
Keep up, boy.

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:29.056
How do you pass your days here?

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.249
Well, I tend to the dates.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:35.020
I also treat the
sick and help bring

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:36.838
new life into our
world occasionally.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.300
There's something
special about that journey.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:47.366
Each mother brings
something divine to mankind,

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.159
just as your mother
did with you.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:50.369
With me?

01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:51.394
How's that?

01:18:52.437 --> 01:18:53.229
Hope.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.316
Hope for a better tomorrow
is the greatest gift.

01:19:01.863 --> 01:19:03.489
Do you want me to come with you?

01:19:07.535 --> 01:19:09.162
He goes to visit his mother.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:13.458
Come on.

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:05.379
The boy's resting?

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:07.423
It's been a long journey.

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:12.845
John, washing your clothes,

01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:16.724
they're badly
stained with blood.

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:20.811
My name is not John.

01:22:27.735 --> 01:22:28.736
It's Jesus.

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:34.283
And my intuition is correct.

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:36.410
You are knowing.

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:43.793
You're the son of God
recently executed in Jerusalem.

01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:47.421
Said to have been reborn.

01:22:49.674 --> 01:22:50.800
And so I am.

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:59.684
Did being born a man
give you no insight?

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:01.686
How could it not?

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:07.149
I recommend experiencing
life as a woman.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:09.652
We're different.

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:13.572
That's being kind.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:19.078
Man, afraid of losing,
treat you so poorly.

01:23:21.706 --> 01:23:24.542
For that I am truly sorry.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:26.752
Yes.

01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:32.091
But many men showed
me love and kindness.

01:23:35.094 --> 01:23:35.970
Hold on to that.

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:43.310
Don't give up on us.

01:23:43.978 --> 01:23:45.455
Don't give up on what?

01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:46.248
You're back.

01:23:46.272 --> 01:23:47.523
I was starting to worry.

01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:49.859
How does it feel to be home?

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:54.488
Different.

01:23:59.577 --> 01:24:00.828
Does the market still operate?

01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:05.058
At this time only the
wine garden is open.

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:05.916
Perfect.

01:24:06.751 --> 01:24:08.210
Don't you wish to rest?

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:12.882
I have plenty of days to rest.

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:15.092
I wish to go.

01:24:25.603 --> 01:24:28.105
Same direction?
Yes.

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:38.574
I will travel with him.

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:41.160
Bless you.

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:43.871
Some feel they must walk alone.

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:46.999
Does not have to be so.

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:55.192
And yet men often
choose that very path.

01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:14.735
You move swiftly
for a man without sight.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:21.200
Longing for
wine will do that to a man.

01:25:27.665 --> 01:25:29.851
Does Luna sit in the sky?

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.436
Oh yes.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.815
A beautiful manifestation
of God's glory.

01:25:34.839 --> 01:25:35.756
You sound passionate.

01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:37.842
I try.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:40.678
You no longer feel this way?

01:25:43.264 --> 01:25:45.099
So why did you
leave your position?

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:50.646
The centurions?
Yes.

01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:58.863
I no longer felt I
was making a difference.

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:03.659
So I left.

01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:13.335
Wherever you go I shall follow.

01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:15.170
Oh, Albus.

01:26:21.135 --> 01:26:24.531
You were scared, I saw you.

01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:28.243
But you didn't see me
'cause you're blind.

01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:39.462
This used to be a
quiet little place.

01:26:39.486 --> 01:26:40.863
Everything changes.

01:26:41.906 --> 01:26:43.073
Oh, that's our table.

01:27:05.346 --> 01:27:07.699
Almost feels like
our place back...

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:08.474
Home.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:12.412
That place is no
longer our home, Albus.

01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:13.395
Never again.

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:15.916
Will you be eating?

01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:19.669
Eating, yes, we'll
be eating food.

01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:21.070
But not yet, but not now.

01:27:22.196 --> 01:27:24.591
We'll be eating
cheese and bread and...

01:27:24.615 --> 01:27:25.366
And wine.

01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:27.910
And water, please.

01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:29.745
Lots of wine.

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:38.921
Won't you share a nectar
of the grape with me, John?

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:40.798
Perhaps.

01:27:51.517 --> 01:27:52.559
Can I help you?

01:27:54.645 --> 01:27:55.437
Probably not.

01:27:57.356 --> 01:27:59.417
Just curious where
you acquired a spear

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:00.567
of such craftsmanship.

01:28:01.402 --> 01:28:02.820
The spear's not for sale.

01:28:04.697 --> 01:28:06.323
You think I wanna purchase it?

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:09.952
I do not know what
you're looking to do.

01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:18.877
Thank you.

01:28:21.422 --> 01:28:24.025
You wish to break bread with us?

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:25.610
What's your name?

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:26.385
Gaius.

01:28:28.012 --> 01:28:29.406
I'm the census.

01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:30.723
I protect this village.

01:28:32.016 --> 01:28:34.828
Now you're doing a very
good job from what I can see.

01:28:34.852 --> 01:28:36.270
I feel safer already.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:40.959
That depends on
what you're here for.

01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:42.252
Wine.

01:28:42.276 --> 01:28:44.319
Is the girl here?
Yes, I'm here.

01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:46.447
Wine, please.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:55.581
You're blind.

01:28:56.457 --> 01:28:57.249
Observant.

01:28:58.459 --> 01:29:01.730
Two unknowns solved by
Gaius, the all-knowing.

01:29:01.754 --> 01:29:02.504
Don't.

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:06.967
Are you mocking me?

01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:08.594
No.

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.265
Are you mocking me?

01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:19.188
I believe I might be.

01:29:27.488 --> 01:29:31.217
I do not understand the
reasoning behind your approach.

01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:34.095
Are you an admirer
of crafted metals?

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:36.181
A bully to the blind?

01:29:36.205 --> 01:29:37.998
What do you seek to gain here?

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:41.853
What do I see?

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:43.188
We have traveled a long distance

01:29:43.212 --> 01:29:45.839
and all we wish to do
is break bread in peace.

01:29:48.092 --> 01:29:49.110
Yeah.

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:50.779
So let us cease this exchange

01:29:50.803 --> 01:29:53.823
until you have truly
something worthy to say.

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:54.598
Let us pray.

01:29:56.683 --> 01:29:58.453
Our Father in heaven...

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:03.500
His kingdom come.

01:30:03.524 --> 01:30:07.670
His will be done on
Earth as it is in heaven.

01:30:07.694 --> 01:30:08.445
He's gone.

01:30:09.696 --> 01:30:11.365
I thought we were
gonna be troubled.

01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:15.494
There's only one troubled
person here at this table.

01:30:18.664 --> 01:30:20.916
Here we are, fresh red wine.

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:26.147
Would you like to
sample our cheeses?

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:27.649
I sure would.

01:30:27.673 --> 01:30:29.424
I'll pick something
up for all of us.

01:30:33.887 --> 01:30:34.930
You may leave the wine.

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:37.391
Thank you.

01:30:53.157 --> 01:30:53.866
More.

01:31:06.545 --> 01:31:07.462
A salute.

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:11.192
I have nothing on my mind.

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:12.217
To going home.

01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:16.805
To going home.

01:31:33.113 --> 01:31:36.843
You really should try
to enjoy your days here.

01:31:36.867 --> 01:31:38.035
She would want that.

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:42.873
How do you know about her?

01:31:44.208 --> 01:31:45.000
Your mother?

01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:50.214
She loved you very much
and she still does.

01:31:54.176 --> 01:31:54.927
Some days...

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:00.849
I can see her face.

01:32:05.896 --> 01:32:07.147
And other days...

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:20.369
That would not rid
you of your pain.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:25.266
But it puts it in
the stable for a while.

01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:28.186
What makes you think
you knew how she felt?

01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:29.169
I have a mother.

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:31.981
I know.

01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:33.215
I put her through a lot.

01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:43.058
I just want her to touch me.

01:32:44.393 --> 01:32:45.185
Feel me.

01:32:51.066 --> 01:32:52.067
Speak to me.

01:32:57.447 --> 01:33:02.327
If she cannot come here
then I shall go to her.

01:33:10.168 --> 01:33:12.129
I came here to...
Pass.

01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:15.173
To embrace the ocean.

01:33:16.967 --> 01:33:18.528
To end it.

01:33:18.552 --> 01:33:19.303
Yes.

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:24.057
It's not your time.

01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:29.330
Hey, John!

01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:30.123
John, look.

01:33:30.147 --> 01:33:32.083
Cheese and bread.

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:33.293
Together!

01:33:33.317 --> 01:33:36.194
It smells so good,
it's a miracle.

01:33:37.321 --> 01:33:38.196
Smells heavenly.

01:33:41.325 --> 01:33:43.344
Is everything all right?

01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:46.014
Everything is as it should be.

01:33:46.038 --> 01:33:46.788
Sit.

01:34:13.398 --> 01:34:16.777
The sun looks like Mithra
rising from the trees.

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:21.716
A thousand ways they
tried to put order

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:23.992
to that which they
do not understand.

01:34:25.827 --> 01:34:28.663
Always they look
outside versus inside.

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:34.544
They worship the creation
but not the creator.

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:40.050
I lived life as they do now.

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:43.970
Still do not think I
fully understood it.

01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:54.832
I was accepted into His graces

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:56.608
before your name was ever known.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:03.091
Many of us held deep
relationships to

01:35:03.115 --> 01:35:04.574
and with the One God.

01:35:10.997 --> 01:35:16.002
Those after us started to
move away from the glorifying

01:35:16.837 --> 01:35:19.172
of the Creator's primal forces.

01:35:20.424 --> 01:35:24.428
Man started to
create their own gods

01:35:25.679 --> 01:35:28.014
to justify their mortal vices.

01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:34.604
A relationship of lies.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:38.608
But I have brought the truth.

01:35:41.319 --> 01:35:43.071
Salvation is within
reach of all.

01:35:49.828 --> 01:35:53.415
But they must want to be saved.

01:36:10.599 --> 01:36:13.477
And what do they call you?
Fate.

01:36:14.478 --> 01:36:16.164
You are a good man.

01:36:16.188 --> 01:36:17.147
I trust you.

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:20.084
Call me John.

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:21.335
I will be looking.

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:22.110
I saw you!

01:36:23.069 --> 01:36:24.488
To embrace the ocean.

01:36:27.407 --> 01:36:28.301
To end it.

01:36:28.325 --> 01:36:31.369
To end it.

01:36:47.052 --> 01:36:49.429
How long were you
planning on staying there?

01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:52.849
All day, if I had to.

01:37:04.736 --> 01:37:06.446
We need to discuss something.

01:37:09.908 --> 01:37:12.035
First, you save us on the road,

01:37:14.538 --> 01:37:16.540
good Samaritan and
all, I get that.

01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:23.338
But I know when a
man has an agenda.

01:37:25.757 --> 01:37:26.633
What's yours?

01:37:28.385 --> 01:37:30.011
I used to think that I knew.

01:37:35.976 --> 01:37:37.769
I know that feeling.

01:37:44.943 --> 01:37:46.736
I'd sacrifice myself,

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:50.991
here and now,

01:37:54.578 --> 01:37:56.246
if I thought I had chance even

01:37:59.708 --> 01:38:01.876
to change us to one
thing for the better.

01:38:04.379 --> 01:38:06.423
Sacrifice is not required.

01:38:10.468 --> 01:38:14.514
You will see your mother again,

01:38:16.975 --> 01:38:18.560
in the kingdom of our Father.

01:38:20.812 --> 01:38:23.398
She didn't follow the
path of the true Messiah.

01:38:25.025 --> 01:38:25.817
I've lost her.

01:38:28.111 --> 01:38:30.196
You believe him to
be the true Messiah?

01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:36.786
I believe you to
be the true Messiah.

01:38:40.707 --> 01:38:41.625
As she does now.

01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:48.715
For upon death, the heart can
say what the tongue never did.

01:38:50.467 --> 01:38:52.385
Rest assured, brother Longinus,

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:56.222
your mother does reside in
the kingdom of my Father.

01:38:59.517 --> 01:39:00.268
You've risen?

01:39:03.647 --> 01:39:05.315
I'm not the Christ Slayer.

01:39:07.525 --> 01:39:08.443
Yes, you are.

01:39:11.029 --> 01:39:15.533
This garden of life
is but one of many.

01:39:18.662 --> 01:39:22.457
This wondrous world and the
stars beyond await discovery.

01:39:23.458 --> 01:39:26.729
Seek and they will
find the processes

01:39:26.753 --> 01:39:30.524
of creation and destruction
are openly displayed

01:39:30.548 --> 01:39:34.469
to anybody who wants
to observe and study.

01:39:42.352 --> 01:39:46.624
But men are more
concerned about waging wars

01:39:46.648 --> 01:39:48.817
and laying claims to
land that nobody owns.

01:39:50.819 --> 01:39:53.547
Being blind inflicts one
to question everything

01:39:53.571 --> 01:39:54.572
that cannot be seen.

01:39:57.242 --> 01:39:59.244
And it forces us
to rely on faith.

01:40:03.081 --> 01:40:06.394
Your lack of
distractions has given you

01:40:06.418 --> 01:40:08.503
clarity and wisdom.

01:40:09.546 --> 01:40:11.190
But what are you doing here?

01:40:11.214 --> 01:40:11.965
With me?

01:40:14.092 --> 01:40:15.719
I thought I was here helping you

01:40:17.512 --> 01:40:19.556
but I think you're
also here helping me.

01:40:21.558 --> 01:40:22.767
I spoke with your mother.

01:40:24.519 --> 01:40:27.772
Yes, she likes you.

01:40:28.982 --> 01:40:31.043
But I killed you.

01:40:31.067 --> 01:40:32.110
She overlooks that.

01:40:34.279 --> 01:40:38.032
She was a good student
and a greater teacher.

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:48.436
I can't believe
that you're the son

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:49.836
of the one true living God.

01:40:52.964 --> 01:40:55.776
There was a day when
you were very excited

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.843
about finding me.

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.555
Master Malkira.

01:41:03.516 --> 01:41:05.518
I remember chasing the star.

01:41:07.103 --> 01:41:08.563
I know their order very well.

01:41:10.482 --> 01:41:13.711
After that encounter I
was under Sabina's care

01:41:13.735 --> 01:41:16.070
until I finally went
back to my father.

01:41:18.782 --> 01:41:20.784
A desperate
play in a greater game.

01:41:22.577 --> 01:41:25.872
Believe in me and he will no
longer have domain over you.

01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:31.628
And what do I owe
you for this freedom?

01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:38.343
Love.

01:41:40.637 --> 01:41:41.721
Love yourself.

01:41:43.723 --> 01:41:44.599
Love others.

01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:47.018
Love me.

01:41:48.686 --> 01:41:49.813
Love to the Father.

01:41:51.981 --> 01:41:53.483
Nothing more is required.

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.991
I want you to come
and follow my voice.

01:42:03.034 --> 01:42:04.577
I want you to be reborn.

01:42:09.791 --> 01:42:11.209
I can do that.

01:42:13.294 --> 01:42:14.730
Come.

01:43:51.017 --> 01:43:52.018
I can see!

01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:57.023
I can see!

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.067
You've come to say goodbye.

01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:47.782
Will their hearts
and their minds ever be worthy?

01:44:49.617 --> 01:44:51.577
We can always reach out in love

01:44:52.453 --> 01:44:53.496
and hold on to hope.

01:44:55.206 --> 01:44:57.834
But will they
ever truly be ready?

01:45:00.837 --> 01:45:03.297
One day the sun above will sleep

01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:07.301
and our kind will
take a final name

01:45:09.178 --> 01:45:10.930
and bid goodnight
to the heavens.

01:45:14.892 --> 01:45:17.353
Was it a mistake
to allow free will?

01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:21.941
It was the right thing.

01:45:23.276 --> 01:45:26.612
You'd be in your right to
leave us and never return.

01:45:28.406 --> 01:45:29.782
I considered it.

01:45:31.659 --> 01:45:33.786
I knew that words
would not be enough.

01:45:35.747 --> 01:45:37.957
I thought that actions
would speak loudest.

01:45:38.791 --> 01:45:39.917
To some they do.

01:45:41.753 --> 01:45:42.855
Yes.

01:45:42.879 --> 01:45:45.048
But now it's time
for me to go home.

01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:51.864
Peace be with you.

01:45:51.888 --> 01:45:53.365
Peace be with you.

01:46:15.036 --> 01:46:16.638
Sabina!

01:46:16.662 --> 01:46:18.932
Sabina!
What is it?

01:46:20.083 --> 01:46:21.042
I can see.

01:46:22.919 --> 01:46:24.688
God has blessed me!

01:46:43.648 --> 01:46:44.649
A new start!

01:46:56.786 --> 01:46:57.846
Albus?

01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:59.705
It'd be good for him.

01:47:05.378 --> 01:47:09.715
You'll take care of him.
I will do my very best.

01:47:13.928 --> 01:47:14.971
How?

01:47:16.973 --> 01:47:18.158
How?

01:47:18.182 --> 01:47:19.701
I prayed on it.

01:47:19.725 --> 01:47:20.476
I prayed.

01:47:34.073 --> 01:47:37.160
Is your journey complete?

01:47:38.369 --> 01:47:40.288
I have one more task for you.

01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:44.083
I do not understand.

01:47:49.463 --> 01:47:53.176
Are you not eager to
return to the kingdom?

01:47:57.013 --> 01:47:58.097
You're welcome.

01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:35.194
Albus stood right by me.

01:48:35.218 --> 01:48:36.427
I had a guide the whole way.

01:48:55.071 --> 01:48:57.257
Is it finished, my Lord?

01:48:57.281 --> 01:48:58.616
It's just begun.

01:49:01.327 --> 01:49:05.098
Come, let us
return to the kingdom.
