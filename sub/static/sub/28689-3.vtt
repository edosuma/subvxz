01:08.809 --> 01:10.966
- Shut up!
- What do you want?

01:10.968 --> 01:13.128
Knock! Be quiet.

01:17.567 --> 01:20.005
- Hello, love.
- Shut up, don't move.

01:20.007 --> 01:23.484
- Please, don't hurt me.
- Move!

01:23.486 --> 01:26.366
Move, c'mon!
Go in, move!

01:27.645 --> 01:29.243
Move!

01:29.245 --> 01:31.202
Stay there, don't speak.

01:31.204 --> 01:33.203
Sit there and don't move.

01:33.205 --> 01:35.764
Give me the phone.
Santiago, go in there.

01:42.763 --> 01:45.600
Everybody out and go in there.

01:45.602 --> 01:47.960
- What's going on?
- Come out, move!

01:47.962 --> 01:50.440
Get down here, on the floor. Move!

01:50.442 --> 01:53.799
Get down on the floor and don't move.

01:53.801 --> 01:55.638
Who's in here? Come out.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.598
You go too, move!
On your knees, like them.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.719
Go get the wallets in the rooms.

02:03.599 --> 02:08.038
Don't move. Keep still!
Don't move!

02:10.198 --> 02:12.718
Put it in here, hurry!

02:13.998 --> 02:17.117
Everyone get up
and go in there, quick!

02:18.397 --> 02:20.117
Move, you too!

02:22.756 --> 02:24.954
Are you still here? Move!

02:24.956 --> 02:29.673
Get on your knees. You too.
On your knees. Let's go.

02:29.675 --> 02:32.353
Carmine, I got everyone's wallets?

02:32.355 --> 02:35.834
- Get up! Where do you keep the money?
- In there.

02:37.034 --> 02:41.551
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You shut up!

02:41.553 --> 02:45.151
You shut up! Shut up!

02:45.153 --> 02:51.311
Shut up, you hear me?
Shut up or I'll kill you.

02:56.470 --> 02:58.990
Give me the money, hurry up.

03:01.270 --> 03:03.907
It's all here, I swear.
Now go, please!

03:03.909 --> 03:05.949
Santiago, let's go!

03:33.225 --> 03:35.504
The Holy Virgin sent you,
Donna Patrizia.

03:41.903 --> 03:43.383
Hello?

03:45.062 --> 03:46.822
Okay, be right there.

03:50.182 --> 03:52.061
- We gotta go.
- All right.

03:56.421 --> 03:59.618
- Donna Patrizia, excuse me.
- Watch it! Mind your manners.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.138
It's important.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.417
Don't worry,
tomorrow we'll fix everything.

04:03.419 --> 04:05.139
Thanks anyway.

04:51.051 --> 04:53.171
Let's see if you learnt...

04:54.571 --> 04:58.450
- Who is in charge here?
- Patrizia.

04:59.731 --> 05:02.930
Donna Patrizia! Who is it, your sister?

05:03.929 --> 05:06.447
- What do you say?
- Donna Patrizia.

05:06.449 --> 05:09.089
- Louder!
- Donna Patrizia.

05:10.728 --> 05:14.285
Scumbags, wash your mouth out
before you say her name.

05:14.287 --> 05:16.128
Nicola.

05:23.206 --> 05:25.086
Whose kids are you?

05:27.805 --> 05:29.245
No one.

05:31.404 --> 05:33.805
Dad's in jail in Secondigliano.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.484
And your mom?

05:38.763 --> 05:41.281
Mom...

05:41.283 --> 05:43.163
Mom's dead.

05:48.802 --> 05:52.481
- Where do you live?
- In Secondigliano.

05:54.241 --> 05:58.400
With my big sister and a little brother.

06:14.198 --> 06:20.355
You and your brother are just kids,
but here you grow up fast.

06:20.357 --> 06:21.917
Don't forget that.

06:25.555 --> 06:28.274
- Leave him alone.
- What?

06:28.276 --> 06:29.875
Nicola, come.

06:37.434 --> 06:39.231
Do they belong to anyone?

06:39.233 --> 06:42.550
They work on their own,
they're not under anyone.

06:42.552 --> 06:45.031
They need to understand
how the world works.

06:45.033 --> 06:48.030
Get them a job and stay on them.

06:48.032 --> 06:51.431
They're a couple of pissants
who don't listen to no one.

06:52.831 --> 06:56.510
- Can we trust them?
- We'll see.

06:58.230 --> 07:00.308
Nicola...

07:00.310 --> 07:04.267
I know you think you should
command with a stick,

07:04.269 --> 07:07.508
but then the stick breaks
and you've seen it.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.188
We gotta change strategy.

08:29.335 --> 08:32.414
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you all day.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.452
Give it to me,
I'll show you how to play.

08:36.453 --> 08:37.813
Well?

08:47.732 --> 08:49.489
What have you done?

08:49.491 --> 08:51.732
What happened to you?
What have you done?

08:54.011 --> 08:55.531
Nothing.

08:58.530 --> 09:01.450
Santiago, what happened?

09:02.810 --> 09:05.649
I said nothing happened, all right?

09:10.008 --> 09:14.605
It's you, it's always you.
You're leading him down the wrong path.

09:14.607 --> 09:18.367
Leave the kid alone,
I don't want him to end up like you.

09:19.567 --> 09:22.166
What are you gonna do about it?

09:24.606 --> 09:28.525
He's still gotta eat, I didn't prepare
anything yet, you take care of it.

11:00.550 --> 11:04.909
BOLOGNA CENTRAL STATION

12:30.335 --> 12:32.812
- Want anything?
- Another time.

12:32.814 --> 12:37.054
There's a million euros in the car
out front, for the down payment.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.172
- When the job's done, you get the rest.
- All right.

12:45.213 --> 12:47.890
Why didn't we see each other in Naples?

12:47.892 --> 12:50.891
- Problems?
- No, I had stuff to do in Bologna.

13:13.407 --> 13:15.566
Can I help you?

13:15.568 --> 13:17.765
There should be a booking for Ferreri.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.367
I'll check right away.

13:22.686 --> 13:26.763
- Fifth floor, room 501.
- Thank you.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.285
Thank you.

15:41.703 --> 15:43.621
Counselor.

15:43.623 --> 15:46.342
- Did you find it easily?
- No problem.

15:59.140 --> 16:00.700
This way, counselor.

16:16.337 --> 16:19.375
This is the sales contract for the dump.

16:19.377 --> 16:24.334
For you there's 20,000 euros up front,
a repayment schedule for the bank debt

16:24.336 --> 16:28.214
and we'll give you something
for the bank guarantees.

16:28.216 --> 16:29.693
And then?

16:29.695 --> 16:33.332
There's time for the paperwork
to go through before closing.

16:33.334 --> 16:36.574
Meanwhile, I'll put a figurehead in,
one of our guys.

16:39.213 --> 16:42.930
I don't have any intention at 60

16:42.932 --> 16:46.772
of having them come to get me
at six in the morning.

16:52.092 --> 16:53.931
You need to relax.

16:57.010 --> 16:59.568
You're in clover.

16:59.570 --> 17:03.489
All I want is reassurance
that you're doing things by the book.

17:05.089 --> 17:10.086
- I'm handing you a structure...
- Pasanelli...

17:10.088 --> 17:13.287
You've always tried to do things
by the book, right?

17:15.528 --> 17:18.565
And what have you accomplished?

17:18.567 --> 17:22.326
In two years 500,000 euros profit
and 800,000 in debt.

17:23.486 --> 17:26.643
If I come here now
and I repay those debts,

17:26.645 --> 17:29.125
do you think I'm doing it all
by the book?

17:30.484 --> 17:32.205
No.

17:50.561 --> 17:52.881
- Yo, what do you want?
- A piece.

17:55.561 --> 17:57.400
Give me a piece.

18:15.957 --> 18:17.437
Let's go.

19:02.390 --> 19:03.989
So little?

19:07.149 --> 19:08.669
Boys...

19:10.828 --> 19:13.467
After what you did it's too much.

19:14.948 --> 19:16.867
Now get out of here.

19:30.264 --> 19:32.823
You did a good job.

19:32.825 --> 19:36.262
If you behave,
there's a monthly payment for you too.

19:36.264 --> 19:38.703
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:06.659 --> 20:09.056
The deal with our friend is done.

20:09.058 --> 20:12.616
- Good, it's already full here.
- All the paperwork's done.

20:12.618 --> 20:15.815
We can send the garbage
to the new plant from tomorrow.

20:15.817 --> 20:19.375
How the fuck can you stand
this disgusting stink?

20:19.377 --> 20:23.096
What stink? The only thing
I can smell here is money, Fabrizio.

20:28.615 --> 20:31.894
In the last three days we've treated
three tons of garbage.

20:33.734 --> 20:37.812
That shit is the finished product,
ready to be trucked out.

20:37.814 --> 20:41.171
The construction business
is the biggest we have.

20:41.173 --> 20:44.972
And we have as much raw material
as we need, infinite.

22:17.596 --> 22:19.955
- All good?
- <i>Yes.</i>

22:19.957 --> 22:23.234
<i>Soon, tons of reinforced concrete
will be ready.</i>

22:23.236 --> 22:26.233
Are you coming back?

22:26.235 --> 22:30.075
I still have something to do in Bologna.
I'm staying overnight.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.514
- <i>Dad?</i>
- All right.

23:36.263 --> 23:40.381
It's just you didn't tell me
where we're going tonight,

23:40.383 --> 23:42.503
so I bought this.

23:44.142 --> 23:46.182
It's a surprise, I told you.

23:47.502 --> 23:49.861
Don't be silly! How do I look?

23:56.141 --> 23:58.020
You look beautiful, Patrizia.

24:24.455 --> 24:27.174
Hand me the cape,
I'll put it away for you.

24:27.176 --> 24:28.535
Sure.

24:29.535 --> 24:31.972
I'll be right back.

24:31.974 --> 24:33.774
May I?

24:50.572 --> 24:52.529
- Mickey!
- My man!

24:52.531 --> 24:54.649
- Dude!
- How are you?

24:54.651 --> 24:58.728
- Good! I'm glad you came.
- Me too. This is Patrizia.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.530
Fabio, my pleasure.

25:01.809 --> 25:06.847
I'm the guy who put up with five years
of university with the out-of-towner.

25:06.849 --> 25:08.489
You put up with me?

25:10.048 --> 25:13.285
- And where are you from?
- Naples.

25:13.287 --> 25:17.045
- You found a girl from your area.
- Of course!

25:17.047 --> 25:21.324
You know Mickey, right?
In the end, he went home.

25:21.326 --> 25:25.765
He did the right thing.
And what do you do, Patrizia?

25:27.485 --> 25:30.404
I do more or less what he does.

25:34.124 --> 25:35.884
Let's go in here.

25:37.323 --> 25:39.164
Let's park here.

26:05.239 --> 26:07.438
Excuse me! Two vodka shots.

26:37.434 --> 26:39.951
- Mickey!
- Eleonora!

26:39.953 --> 26:42.030
- How are you?
- Good, you?

26:42.032 --> 26:44.271
All good. This is Patrizia.

26:44.273 --> 26:47.072
- Nice to meet you, Eleonora.
- Nice to meet you.

26:48.711 --> 26:52.789
- What are you doing here?
- We came to get a drink. You?

26:52.791 --> 26:55.388
I always come here.

26:55.390 --> 26:57.910
- It's good to see you.
- Me too.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.390
Right... How long are you staying?

27:02.749 --> 27:04.829
Just long enough to have a drink.

27:06.669 --> 27:08.828
Mickey... wait.

27:14.708 --> 27:19.184
- All right. Maybe I'll see you later.
- Maybe.

27:19.186 --> 27:22.506
Have a good night. Bye, Fabrizia.

27:28.905 --> 27:30.705
Everything okay, Patrizia?

27:42.663 --> 27:45.142
It's no good, you need to change it.

27:47.542 --> 27:50.381
Sorry, can you make another one?
It's no good.

28:12.018 --> 28:13.777
Patrizia!

28:15.457 --> 28:17.216
Patrizia, stop!

28:41.332 --> 28:44.091
I'm Carmine,
he's my brother Santiago.

28:44.093 --> 28:45.650
Pleasure, Ilenia.

28:45.652 --> 28:47.572
- She's Anna.
- Pleasure.

28:51.331 --> 28:53.771
- Wanna dance?
- Let's dance.

29:04.129 --> 29:06.246
- Want some coke?
- No, I got no money.

29:06.249 --> 29:08.648
- It's a present.
- Wait.

29:10.048 --> 29:11.686
What happened?

29:11.688 --> 29:14.246
He wants to give us some coke,
what do we do?

29:14.248 --> 29:16.727
What do we do? We take it.

29:18.167 --> 29:19.926
Okay, let's go.

30:12.598 --> 30:15.237
- Turn it off.
- No, or else they'll hear us.

30:51.112 --> 30:54.229
- Santiago, got something to snort with?
- No, nothing.

30:54.231 --> 30:55.910
You got anything?

30:57.070 --> 31:00.270
- Turn off the water.
- Here.

32:10.418 --> 32:13.377
- Got any more?
- Wait here.

32:24.015 --> 32:26.053
What are you going to do?
We're outta cash.

32:26.055 --> 32:28.095
You'll see.

32:57.570 --> 32:59.410
- Give me 20.
- Another one?

33:00.570 --> 33:02.369
Another one.

33:07.529 --> 33:09.526
Bro', you got five?

33:09.528 --> 33:11.767
- Yeah, you want ten?
- Give me ten.

33:18.207 --> 33:20.524
Guys!

33:20.526 --> 33:22.606
You find it? Let's go.

33:34.124 --> 33:36.203
Catch those little shits!

34:02.999 --> 34:05.757
There they are, turn around.

34:05.759 --> 34:07.118
Turn!

34:13.637 --> 34:15.516
We'll go in this way.

34:55.830 --> 34:58.188
Guys, they're up there.

34:58.190 --> 35:01.909
We found them, hurry up.

35:27.385 --> 35:29.702
Come out! Better for everyone if you do!

35:29.704 --> 35:32.344
There they are, little shits.

35:37.703 --> 35:42.340
Now you run away, piece of shit!
Now you have to run away!

35:42.342 --> 35:44.940
Did you have fun being an asshole?

35:44.942 --> 35:47.942
Did you have fun, you piece of shit?

35:52.221 --> 35:55.419
What the fuck
are you doing on our turf?

35:55.421 --> 35:59.779
- Who do you belong to?
- We're from Secondigliano.

36:01.940 --> 36:04.057
We're under Patrizia.

36:04.059 --> 36:09.176
That ugly bitch Patrizia
brings her trash onto our turf?

36:09.178 --> 36:13.098
- Is that right?
- They're just talking shit, Enzo.

36:20.576 --> 36:22.456
Let's take it easy, guys.

36:25.495 --> 36:28.495
I'm not getting my hands dirty
with Patrizia's shit.

36:36.934 --> 36:38.733
Patrizia?

37:13.407 --> 37:16.887
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

37:22.086 --> 37:25.445
- Welcome back, Donna Patrizia.
- Hi, Nicola.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.361
Leave us.

38:04.119 --> 38:06.236
Well?

38:06.238 --> 38:08.878
- Sorry, Donna Patrizia.
- Yeah, sorry...

38:09.958 --> 38:11.358
How could you?

38:12.438 --> 38:16.275
I stick my neck out
to give you an opportunity

38:16.277 --> 38:18.277
and how do you repay me?

38:19.876 --> 38:22.116
You go dicking around in Forcella?

38:23.755 --> 38:26.596
- We were just joking.
- Joking?

38:28.675 --> 38:31.714
If it was a joke,
why aren't you laughing, Carmine?

38:34.194 --> 38:38.111
No, Donna Patrizia! Please!

38:38.113 --> 38:42.031
He's my little slave,
he does everything I tell him to.

38:42.033 --> 38:44.992
Take it out on me, not my brother.

38:48.471 --> 38:49.952
Carmine...

38:51.111 --> 38:52.551
Carmine...

38:54.270 --> 38:58.190
It's not that I don't want to be defied
by two snot-noses like you...

39:01.069 --> 39:03.429
It's just that I can't.

39:23.346 --> 39:25.025
Make them disappear.

39:33.784 --> 39:36.021
Hello, Enzo.

39:36.023 --> 39:38.624
Thank you, I took care of it personally.

39:40.383 --> 39:42.702
What will we tell their family now?

39:45.662 --> 39:47.782
They only had a sister.

39:50.461 --> 39:54.421
If they come, tell them I treat everyone
in Secondigliano like my children.

39:55.461 --> 39:58.420
But if they disrespect me,
they have to pay.

40:21.576 --> 40:23.695
Good evening.
Would you like to order?

40:26.256 --> 40:28.855
Can you send him to me?

40:34.134 --> 40:35.894
All right.

41:05.448 --> 41:07.609
I'm sorry, he says he can't.

41:08.808 --> 41:10.648
Can I help you?

41:14.248 --> 41:15.967
No, thanks.

41:28.644 --> 41:30.285
Who was she?

41:32.804 --> 41:34.124
Nobody.
