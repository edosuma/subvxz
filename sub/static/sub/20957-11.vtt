<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp.</i>

00:01.345 --> 00:03.596
I belief your sister knows
where the last seal is.

00:03.668 --> 00:06.312
Give it to me, and I'll save
your little lover's life.

00:06.337 --> 00:07.754
- Trust us.
- I need your help.

00:07.779 --> 00:09.415
- My price'll be steep.
- Whatever it takes.

00:09.439 --> 00:11.866
Doc's ring? The third seal.

00:11.891 --> 00:13.421
Waverly... what did you do?

00:13.446 --> 00:14.702
- That.
- No deal!

00:14.727 --> 00:16.280
Hands off that trophy, witch!

00:16.306 --> 00:17.368
No!

00:17.393 --> 00:19.820
- You two Earp girls...
- One will disappear.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.703
I know what we need to do...

00:21.728 --> 00:24.091
- Wynonna!
- Who's Wynonna?

00:24.116 --> 00:27.285
No idea! We've got a wedding to plan!

00:27.467 --> 00:29.562
Wynonna!

Oh God!

01:01.678 --> 01:04.178
Get in that barn! Get
the hell in that barn!

01:05.777 --> 01:07.213
Guys! I found it! It's over here!

01:07.238 --> 01:08.402
It's too late! We're not gonna make it.

01:08.426 --> 01:11.203
No! I cannot die! I've only
had sex one and a half times!

01:11.228 --> 01:13.058
Guys, we're not going to die.

01:13.919 --> 01:15.191
Jesus! Jesus! Watch that thing, Jeremy!

01:15.215 --> 01:16.206
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

01:16.231 --> 01:17.629
- I know how to get her back.
- Who?!

01:17.653 --> 01:19.813
Wynonna. I just hope it's not too late.

Wynonna? Wynonna!

01:51.611 --> 01:53.531
Please, help! I'm in the well!

01:53.616 --> 01:56.250
<i>Hey, Boss. It's just me, Stevie.</i>

01:56.394 --> 01:57.913
Why did you... call me?

01:57.938 --> 01:59.383
<i>You said you didn't wanna see my face.</i>

01:59.407 --> 02:01.794
- <i>Until you found it, Boss.</i>
- I changed my mind,

02:01.819 --> 02:03.460
get me the hell out of here!

02:03.485 --> 02:06.248
Somethin' wrong with that ladder?

02:15.965 --> 02:18.899
So, did you?

02:20.340 --> 02:22.796
- What's that?
- Find it.

02:27.515 --> 02:28.804
Peacemaker?

02:28.829 --> 02:31.329
Mother of Pearl, no! Your ring.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.007
I do not give two shits
about that ring right now.

02:35.592 --> 02:36.742
Sure.

02:36.829 --> 02:38.629
It's not like you slashed
eight of our guys

02:38.654 --> 02:40.320
since it went missing.

02:42.261 --> 02:44.194
Something's missing alright.

02:44.672 --> 02:46.296
Take me to the Earp homestead.

02:46.321 --> 02:47.826
That name's been banned,

02:47.851 --> 02:50.117
on threat of ball-crushing death.

02:50.155 --> 02:52.063
Your words.

02:52.416 --> 02:53.758
Well if they are my words,

02:53.783 --> 02:56.453
then it is my rule, seems
only I can break them.

02:56.478 --> 02:58.878
- You got it, Joey?
- Stevie.

03:00.045 --> 03:01.665
...Joey's fine.

03:01.690 --> 03:04.257
And for god sakes...

03:05.026 --> 03:07.026
Somebody put a lid on that thing.

03:13.191 --> 03:15.658
Aagh!

03:21.878 --> 03:23.978
Shipment went out today,
no trouble, Boss.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.315
"Boss"?

03:26.297 --> 03:28.080
The Boss?

03:28.113 --> 03:30.113
Old Gramps out at the
Hitchens place threatened us

03:30.138 --> 03:32.238
with a Blue Light Special,
but I shot this off.

03:32.591 --> 03:34.991
Let's just say that he's
got two bad ears now.

03:38.568 --> 03:41.861
Did you skim any of my
payment from said shipment?

03:41.941 --> 03:43.486
No Boss!

03:43.531 --> 03:45.498
Please, not like Wayne.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.314
Who's that now?

03:48.449 --> 03:51.383
She's at it again. No,
I told her no more.

03:52.025 --> 03:54.492
You know how stubborn she is.

03:54.517 --> 03:56.042
Well, that I certainly do.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.378
You want me to take care of her?

03:57.403 --> 03:59.403
Hey! Get back to work.

04:07.173 --> 04:08.635
Wynonna?

04:10.330 --> 04:12.918
I'm going to need another poster.

04:12.943 --> 04:14.486
This one's nearly out of face.

04:14.511 --> 04:16.112
Rosita! What the hell
are you doing here?!

04:16.136 --> 04:18.228
Cooking product that you
don't deserve to sell.

04:18.253 --> 04:19.434
I need your help.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.430
Wynonna and the baby,
they've been taken...

04:22.265 --> 04:24.236
I told you, if you ever touched me,

04:24.289 --> 04:25.814
I'd poison the lot of you.

04:25.839 --> 04:27.284
You're shackled.

04:28.317 --> 04:30.853
- Did I do this?
- Yeah. Six months ago.

04:30.899 --> 04:32.565
Who's Wynonna?

04:32.991 --> 04:34.991
In a different world, my
hand was on the trophy

04:35.094 --> 04:37.361
when Gretta cast the spell,
made Wynonna vanish...

04:37.676 --> 04:39.393
Or did she ever even exist?

04:39.418 --> 04:40.433
Seriously, Boss?

04:40.458 --> 04:42.374
Have you been snorting too
much of your own product?

04:42.398 --> 04:44.083
I must've gotten myself out of the well,

04:44.108 --> 04:46.821
rallied this sad ballsack of a gang.

04:49.138 --> 04:51.471
Without her I'm...

04:52.848 --> 04:53.951
What are...

04:53.983 --> 04:56.817
- What are you doing?
- Setting you free.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.475
Waverly Earp. Do you know her?

04:58.500 --> 05:00.865
- I know a Waverly Gibson.
- Xavier Dolls?

05:01.129 --> 05:02.862
Yeah, Deputy Marshall Dolls.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.566
He'll shoot you on sight.

05:04.591 --> 05:05.606
So some things haven't changed.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.151
I need to speak with him immediately.

05:07.169 --> 05:10.340
Yeah, well, you better
bring backup then.

05:18.892 --> 05:20.925
Or something that will make him listen.

05:22.849 --> 05:24.488
<i>She's vanished.</i>

05:24.535 --> 05:27.602
We're free.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.867
You're gonna tell me
what I need to know,

05:31.331 --> 05:33.298
or you'll die trying.

05:44.092 --> 05:47.560
Without her, you will all die.

05:47.858 --> 05:49.758
Who?

05:55.536 --> 05:57.521
Remind me again,

05:57.648 --> 05:59.067
how did you capture me?

05:59.162 --> 06:00.717
We followed your trail of dead priests,

06:00.741 --> 06:02.220
construction workers, and...

06:05.028 --> 06:06.380
Marvelous.

06:06.423 --> 06:08.311
Doesn't matter. You're here now
and you're going to tell us

06:08.335 --> 06:10.302
what you're doing here in purgatory.

06:10.336 --> 06:13.123
Yeah, and why you're
destroying consecrated ground.

06:13.575 --> 06:15.849
Also, there's a lot of
creatures making their way

06:15.874 --> 06:17.444
to the Ghost River Triangle.

06:17.469 --> 06:20.704
Why? What are they searching for?

06:21.188 --> 06:24.055
You're the one who should
be searching for something.

06:26.055 --> 06:28.289
Let me give you a hint...

06:28.589 --> 06:30.889
It's a woman.

06:31.751 --> 06:33.069
Beth?

06:33.308 --> 06:35.575
Yeah. She'll be joining you soon.

06:41.219 --> 06:43.014
You're so close!

06:43.518 --> 06:46.953
It's going to be like
Christmas, watching you writhe.

06:48.064 --> 06:49.944
♪ Sheriff Clootie ♪

06:49.969 --> 06:52.036
♪ we will raise ♪

06:52.414 --> 06:54.201
♪ to cause them ♪

06:54.337 --> 06:57.556
♪ this pain ♪

06:59.189 --> 07:02.334
Doc Holliday. The Doc Holliday.

07:02.387 --> 07:03.951
Dolls...

07:03.987 --> 07:05.951
- What happened to your face?
- You and a knife.

07:05.976 --> 07:08.092
And I cannot wait to return the favor.

07:08.248 --> 07:10.975
You shoot me, it's gonna be
one hell of an explosion.

07:11.020 --> 07:12.858
Oh yeah, I've seen your work up close.

07:12.883 --> 07:14.306
Are you here to confess,

07:14.331 --> 07:16.897
about the power plant? Lumber yard?

07:16.922 --> 07:17.990
Nedley's house?

07:18.015 --> 07:19.690
- Sheriff Nedley?
- Yeah.

07:19.715 --> 07:21.315
No, I would never!

07:22.677 --> 07:24.218
My God...

07:24.289 --> 07:26.322
Is this what we are without her?

07:26.371 --> 07:27.733
Her?

07:29.499 --> 07:30.616
She was...

07:30.696 --> 07:33.733
She was everything! And
she has been taken,

07:33.758 --> 07:35.890
or worse, erased!

07:38.494 --> 07:40.015
Are you gonna make a demand?

07:40.040 --> 07:42.669
Because if you're gonna make it,
make it now, before I shoot

07:42.694 --> 07:45.762
that compensating moustache
off your smirking face.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.227
I want you to remember.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.483
We have the Doc Holliday in custody.

07:58.508 --> 08:01.593
Oh my gosh! I have so
many questions for him.

08:02.007 --> 08:03.718
Put him in there with whatever she is.

08:03.743 --> 08:04.823
Well, what if she eats him?

08:05.166 --> 08:07.601
Well, it's like black
widows in a jar, Jeremy.

08:08.284 --> 08:10.150
May the best bitch win.

08:13.908 --> 08:16.437
Lonnie, why am I holding
a missing person report

08:16.469 --> 08:17.799
with the word "person" scratched out

08:17.823 --> 08:19.000
and "pug" written above?

08:19.797 --> 08:21.657
Mrs. Grandeur's dog disappeared.

08:23.166 --> 08:26.322
I don't know why anybody would
keep a dog in purgatory, though.

08:26.408 --> 08:29.181
- What, with all those coyotes.
- Coyotes.

08:29.206 --> 08:32.414
Right. Lonnie, we have
forms for missing animals.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.440
You really gotta pay attention.

08:36.769 --> 08:38.702
God, I'm trying my best Old Man,

08:39.221 --> 08:41.054
but... damn, I miss you.

09:11.987 --> 09:13.854
- Your regular, Chicken salad.
- Oh!

09:13.879 --> 09:15.822
But I added pickles.
Do you like pickles?

09:15.896 --> 09:17.588
- I love 'em.
- Oh, great.

09:17.669 --> 09:19.072
Food's not moving like it used to,

09:19.097 --> 09:21.690
- so we're pits deep in 'em.
- Ah, things'll turn around!

09:21.782 --> 09:23.471
You put your face on a shorty's sign,

09:23.496 --> 09:25.253
we're gonna have a tidal
wave of new purgatorians!

09:25.277 --> 09:28.345
I might have to put my face on the
"now leaving purgatory" sign.

09:28.461 --> 09:30.428
- You're really doin' it, huh?
- Yeah.

09:30.969 --> 09:33.035
It's time, you know. For real.

09:33.498 --> 09:35.332
It's real.

09:35.479 --> 09:38.291
Oh, hey! You guys are sort
of like DMV now, right?

09:38.371 --> 09:40.597
'Cause I need to fill out
a change of name form.

09:40.636 --> 09:41.651
I haven't-

09:41.676 --> 09:43.683
- I got it.
- Wait, I thought you said...

09:43.708 --> 09:45.808
Phone, Lonnie. Get the phone.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.925
Purgatory police department.

09:48.950 --> 09:50.270
OK!

09:50.528 --> 09:53.316
Waverly Gibson.

09:53.620 --> 09:54.862
Date of birth:

09:54.921 --> 09:58.121
- September 8th.
- Wait! You know my birthday?

09:59.183 --> 10:01.308
Um... yeah, I guess I do.

10:01.664 --> 10:03.246
Well, little known fact.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.121
My real last name is Earp.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.238
Yeah. I was raised by an
incredible woman named Gus Gibson.

10:08.473 --> 10:10.730
- So, I sort of borrowed the name.
- Oh, I had no idea.

10:10.803 --> 10:13.437
The name Earp. Ugh. It's such a curse!

10:15.433 --> 10:16.863
Oh, I like this!

10:17.238 --> 10:18.355
It's simple.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.519
The one thing marriage is not.

10:21.213 --> 10:23.246
Why am I wearing this?

10:24.316 --> 10:25.863
Well...

10:26.791 --> 10:28.858
A fresh start.

10:29.079 --> 10:30.933
I'd be a fool not to marry him. Right?

10:30.958 --> 10:32.520
As long as you believe
it, in your heart.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.183
I sort of feel like I'm, you know...

10:34.208 --> 10:36.975
Running towards a cliff,
terrified of jumping, but...

10:37.080 --> 10:39.566
Well, if it's right, you
don't think about the cliff

10:39.641 --> 10:42.628
because you're sure when you
reach the edge, you'll fly.

10:45.995 --> 10:47.417
If you go off a cliff,

10:47.471 --> 10:49.191
don't you die?

10:49.370 --> 10:52.124
Oh!

10:52.307 --> 10:54.207
He's outside.

10:55.012 --> 10:57.846
- Thanks for this.
- Thanks for lunch.

10:59.405 --> 11:02.121
You gonna eat those pickles? What?

11:02.412 --> 11:04.371
- You don't like 'em.
- Well, I do now.

11:06.175 --> 11:07.691
Every second she is gone

11:07.716 --> 11:09.371
is another we are doomed.

11:09.396 --> 11:11.172
Dolls! Jeremy!

11:11.197 --> 11:14.144
- Now, come on!
- Dolls, Jeremy, Nicole!

11:14.169 --> 11:16.937
Such pretty names for
such pretty corpses!

11:17.216 --> 11:19.216
You stay away from me, you ripe slag!

11:25.821 --> 11:27.887
Oh, all out of poison, are we?

11:28.772 --> 11:30.667
How did you know?

11:31.234 --> 11:33.316
Because Dolls would
never place me in here

11:33.341 --> 11:34.910
if there was a real chance of death!

11:34.935 --> 11:38.558
- He hates your gangster guts!
- Only in this world!

11:39.201 --> 11:40.558
Oh...

11:40.583 --> 11:44.777
So you see it, too, John Henry?
Something has shifted

11:44.807 --> 11:47.341
in the fabric of our reality.

11:47.839 --> 11:49.300
Without the heir

11:49.325 --> 11:50.488
here to stop us,

11:50.513 --> 11:52.647
we will resurrect our husband

11:52.703 --> 11:54.581
and have the party of the century.

11:54.873 --> 11:57.273
All are invited.

11:57.549 --> 11:59.316
Few will survive.

11:59.547 --> 12:01.613
Not if I can get outta here!

12:01.858 --> 12:04.488
And I will get outta here!

12:04.817 --> 12:06.230
Me, too.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.323
And when that useless c-word of a sister

12:08.396 --> 12:11.121
finally realizes how
much she needs me...

12:13.026 --> 12:15.460
...I will.

12:19.642 --> 12:21.776
I admit it, I'm gonna miss that shirt.

12:22.231 --> 12:23.729
Really? God, I can't wait

12:23.754 --> 12:25.754
to burn this thing.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.190
What?

12:27.676 --> 12:29.576
You talk about how much
you hate purgatory,

12:29.765 --> 12:31.965
but deep down, you're gonna miss it.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.432
Please.

12:33.471 --> 12:36.405
Once we leave, I can finally
finish my history degree,

12:36.759 --> 12:38.791
and not by doing online courses.

12:38.918 --> 12:41.432
I can... go to India, Spain...

12:41.457 --> 12:43.424
And I want to take you.

12:44.333 --> 12:46.299
But I want to make sure you're ready.

12:46.324 --> 12:47.652
We've been through this three times.

12:47.676 --> 12:49.393
Three wedding dresses, three venues.

12:49.418 --> 12:52.218
I know. I'm... I'm sorry, Perry.

12:52.243 --> 12:56.237
It's just... something
always seems to be missing.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.205
Yeah. Closure.

13:00.483 --> 13:02.229
A few months ago, I hired a P.I. to look

13:02.254 --> 13:04.143
into your Dad's and Willa's murders.

13:04.168 --> 13:06.113
I didn't want to get your hopes
up, so I never said anything.

13:06.137 --> 13:08.237
Because knowing something
about me before me

13:08.262 --> 13:10.462
is a total invasion of my privacy!?

13:11.971 --> 13:13.260
Sorry.

13:13.297 --> 13:14.862
I don't know where that came from.

13:14.887 --> 13:17.252
Waves... the investigator found someone.

13:17.706 --> 13:19.471
The man who killed your family.

13:19.519 --> 13:22.005
He was found wandering back
into purgatory, disoriented.

13:22.037 --> 13:23.417
What?

13:24.076 --> 13:26.299
Two weeks before our wedding?

13:26.772 --> 13:28.658
What are the odds?

13:28.817 --> 13:31.150
- So, where is he now?
- St. Jude's.

13:31.340 --> 13:33.707
He's, um... he's been asking for you.

13:39.145 --> 13:41.278
You checked all metal
items at the front desk?

13:42.971 --> 13:45.105
Yeah, but they didn't tell me why.

13:45.896 --> 13:47.862
You have 10 minutes.

13:49.832 --> 13:52.287
Hello.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.332
My name is Waverly Gibson...

13:56.623 --> 13:57.943
No.

13:59.217 --> 14:00.934
Waverly Earp.

14:05.967 --> 14:09.169
How on earth could I forget? Waverly.

14:10.942 --> 14:13.342
You're my angel.

14:14.707 --> 14:15.973
I came back,

14:18.749 --> 14:20.592
but it's all different.

14:20.911 --> 14:22.044
Why?

14:22.069 --> 14:24.203
My father and sister are still dead.

14:25.521 --> 14:26.670
You killed them,

14:26.695 --> 14:28.929
- made me an orphan.
- Oh, no.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.757
No...

14:32.972 --> 14:34.406
No.

14:35.369 --> 14:38.624
Your sister killed your father,

14:40.268 --> 14:41.737
...and my Willa.

14:41.762 --> 14:44.884
- What?
- And then me.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.501
Why did you come back to purgatory?

14:49.098 --> 14:51.199
That is not the question.

14:51.756 --> 14:53.808
The question is:

14:54.126 --> 14:55.712
Why now?

14:55.812 --> 14:57.317
I was in hell.

14:57.342 --> 14:59.309
Only an Earp heir can put me there.

14:59.468 --> 15:01.868
Not your father, he was dead.

15:02.049 --> 15:03.849
But if I came back...

15:05.871 --> 15:07.290
...she must have gotten dead.

15:07.315 --> 15:09.001
Is she dead?

15:10.913 --> 15:13.275
I don't know who you're talking about.

15:13.300 --> 15:16.356
No... no.

15:18.995 --> 15:21.363
Wynonna. Wynonna!

15:21.865 --> 15:23.390
It's Wynonna!

15:23.415 --> 15:25.481
OK! That's the second time
I've heard that name.

15:25.506 --> 15:27.907
- Who is Wynonna?
- I told you,

15:28.260 --> 15:29.946
your sister.

15:30.322 --> 15:31.766
No.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.033
I had one sister.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.042
Willa.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.134
And you slaughtered her!

15:39.364 --> 15:41.597
Oh, yes.

15:42.788 --> 15:44.955
It's a spell.

15:45.895 --> 15:48.128
A flimsy one, but...

15:48.856 --> 15:51.492
She's only shaded. Missing.

15:51.595 --> 15:54.138
- Don't.
- She's missing.

15:55.082 --> 15:57.216
Move.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.363
Don't go. What do you wanna know?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.264
That night on the homestead.

16:07.562 --> 16:09.617
They killed everyone...

16:09.870 --> 16:11.379
But me.

16:13.332 --> 16:15.019
- Why?
- They knew,

16:15.311 --> 16:17.746
no one harms

16:18.536 --> 16:20.120
the baby.

16:20.253 --> 16:22.787
My words. My law.

16:25.407 --> 16:27.233
You're my angel.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.791
Fly, fly away...

16:31.089 --> 16:33.389
...and make Wynonna missing no more.

16:37.714 --> 16:39.470
Rise, my demon,

16:39.495 --> 16:41.361
my husband, my master.

16:41.386 --> 16:43.653
Show of yourself and come to reclaim,

16:43.895 --> 16:46.896
all that was lost you
shall once more regain.

16:51.392 --> 16:53.425
Break, damn it!

17:04.060 --> 17:06.541
Oh, I'm so sorry, my darling.

17:23.365 --> 17:25.866
Of course. It takes two.

17:26.368 --> 17:28.368
Boo.

17:36.734 --> 17:38.653
"The Earp curse."

17:38.825 --> 17:41.092
Bullshit.

18:34.553 --> 18:36.753
Oh, that was adorable.

18:38.140 --> 18:40.234
Hey, watch out!

18:40.479 --> 18:42.453
Just once, can I get
some bullets that work?!

18:42.478 --> 18:44.695
The beginning is nigh! When hell rises,

18:44.720 --> 18:48.488
we will skin you alive and pick
our teeth with your bones.

18:49.092 --> 18:51.893
Ugh! So specific.

18:53.404 --> 18:54.640
OK.

18:55.053 --> 18:56.568
Hey, hey, hey!

18:56.639 --> 18:58.412
Put the gun down.

18:58.779 --> 19:00.646
Jeremy, I keep telling you,

19:00.860 --> 19:02.655
you won't hit your target
if you put all your weight

19:02.679 --> 19:04.021
on your back leg.

19:04.132 --> 19:07.350
What?! How did you...
And how did you know

19:07.430 --> 19:09.497
the combo to the... The gun safe?

19:09.944 --> 19:11.804
- Dolls won't even tell me!
- Now, this is going

19:11.828 --> 19:15.264
to sound crazy, but none of this...
is accurate.

19:15.629 --> 19:19.264
We are living in an alternate reality.

19:19.484 --> 19:21.351
Like The Matrix?

19:23.202 --> 19:26.779
Do you even remember how you
came to be working in purgatory?

19:28.100 --> 19:30.367
Yeah! Yeah, I...

19:31.389 --> 19:33.068
I think. I'm...

19:33.866 --> 19:35.295
Maybe I was...

19:35.320 --> 19:36.693
Maybe I was transferred, or...

19:36.718 --> 19:39.785
A spell has been spun, making
enemies of old friends.

19:40.107 --> 19:42.541
I know who you are, Jeremy.

19:42.589 --> 19:45.287
You're a vegetarian with ethics
of steel that still reads.

19:45.312 --> 19:46.748
Doctor Strange comic books at night

19:46.773 --> 19:48.739
because he wants to be a hero.

19:49.826 --> 19:51.726
What?

19:52.788 --> 19:55.303
The explosives that you
strapped on had...

19:55.328 --> 19:57.361
Had... no wires.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.171
No detonator. You...

19:59.196 --> 20:01.385
could have lit that shizzle on fire
and it wouldn't have done a thing.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.071
I could use a good man
to make this right.

20:08.436 --> 20:09.711
A hero.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.494
Yeah! OK!

20:12.636 --> 20:14.669
Yeah, for sure.

20:16.071 --> 20:18.383
But, uh, Dolls is gonna kill me.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.617
He would never trust me.

20:19.642 --> 20:20.703
- Get my coat.
- OK!

20:20.728 --> 20:22.485
I gotta go to Shorty's.
It's our only hope.

20:22.517 --> 20:25.282
Hey! Maybe, uh, sometime
after all this is done,

20:25.307 --> 20:27.453
we could get a drink? Together?

20:32.572 --> 20:35.540
Yeah. Timing, Jeremy. Geez.

20:38.825 --> 20:40.825
I used to hate you for leaving, Mama.

20:42.549 --> 20:44.616
But I get it now.

20:45.446 --> 20:47.946
This town is too hard.

20:56.515 --> 20:57.781
You've got five seconds

20:57.806 --> 20:59.640
to vamoose before I blow your head off!

21:00.324 --> 21:02.196
- Waverly.
- Wait...

21:02.261 --> 21:03.862
Oh, no. Please don't...
Please don't hurt me!

21:03.886 --> 21:05.992
- I'm getting married.
- I would never!

21:06.086 --> 21:08.219
What? Wait. You are?

21:08.252 --> 21:11.954
Lord, please tell me there is
a part of you that knows me.

21:12.214 --> 21:14.981
I know you're a criminal. A killer!

21:16.382 --> 21:17.828
You are not wrong,

21:17.912 --> 21:20.246
but believe me when I say
I am done with that life.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.554
We need to find the Trophy
and bring her back...

21:23.650 --> 21:24.922
Hey!

21:25.475 --> 21:27.352
Keep your hands up, Holliday.

21:27.456 --> 21:30.156
I'm afraid the stakes
are too high, Xavier.

21:30.221 --> 21:31.696
Jeremy told you where I am?

21:31.753 --> 21:33.853
Agent Chetri committed treason.

21:34.058 --> 21:35.858
- Did he mention why?
- Ms. Gibson,

21:35.883 --> 21:37.850
please take cover. Now!

21:41.260 --> 21:44.094
I do not want a fight,
you stubborn bastard.

21:46.144 --> 21:49.145
Good. That'll make blowing
you away a lot easier.

21:53.527 --> 21:56.602
Check what's left of your soul.
We are on the same team.

21:56.627 --> 21:59.394
You've torn this town apart!

22:00.368 --> 22:03.235
- It was the damn demons!
- You run the damn demons!

22:03.260 --> 22:05.758
Oh, and I've recently retired.
Ask Waverly.

22:05.921 --> 22:08.141
Leave me out of this!

22:08.343 --> 22:10.321
This is not who you are, Dolls!

22:11.199 --> 22:13.994
You're a good man! ...With
semi-reptilian tendencies,

22:14.034 --> 22:16.352
- but a good man.
- Reptilian?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.492
How did you know? You've

22:18.517 --> 22:20.578
crossed the line, Doc!

22:24.180 --> 22:26.110
I don't want to be a dick, but I can

22:26.135 --> 22:27.867
outdraw you anywhere, anyhow.

22:27.906 --> 22:28.914
Fine.

22:28.939 --> 22:31.110
- Then shoot me.
- Well...

22:31.222 --> 22:33.823
I would prefer not to, but
I'm on a tight schedule.

22:49.596 --> 22:51.235
Dolls! God damn it! You never leave

22:51.260 --> 22:53.313
the shop without your body Armour.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.672
It's nothing that won't heal.

22:55.697 --> 22:58.180
You'll be up and cursing
my name in no time.

22:58.392 --> 23:00.665
And I am gonna make this right, partner.

23:05.336 --> 23:07.501
I-I do hate it when we argue.

23:18.587 --> 23:20.820
You look so beautiful in that dress.

23:21.899 --> 23:24.266
- It was my mother's.
- Waverly.

23:24.533 --> 23:27.467
Listen to me. You find the Iron Witch;

23:27.586 --> 23:29.586
You destroy the trophy;
You save the child

23:29.611 --> 23:31.544
and you save Wynonna.

23:32.398 --> 23:33.861
I don't know who that is!

23:33.886 --> 23:36.525
She's the only one that can save us

23:36.550 --> 23:39.051
from all this, baby... girl.

23:40.865 --> 23:42.832
What did you call me?

23:59.994 --> 24:01.806
Thanks for coming to get me.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.516
Standard operating procedure.

24:03.541 --> 24:05.994
We both know, that's not true.

24:06.783 --> 24:08.869
I don't know what's... I don't
know what's wrong with me!

24:08.871 --> 24:11.104
Hey! Absolutely nothing.

24:12.596 --> 24:14.574
He's violent and insane

24:14.576 --> 24:16.910
a huge part of the reason why
purgatory went to shit...

24:16.912 --> 24:18.736
But when he died...

24:20.883 --> 24:22.883
Have you ever met someone
and instantly known

24:22.885 --> 24:24.947
in your heart that they
meant something to you?

24:25.104 --> 24:27.972
I might kinda get that, yeah.

24:28.536 --> 24:30.127
God!

24:31.320 --> 24:34.252
He told me to find the Iron Witch.

24:34.714 --> 24:36.431
The way he said it, I...

24:36.806 --> 24:39.096
I think he meant an actual witch.

24:39.619 --> 24:41.455
That's crazy, right? Look, this town

24:41.480 --> 24:43.513
is a haven for crazy. It's...

24:44.517 --> 24:46.123
It's supernatural central.

24:46.236 --> 24:48.900
I've never heard anyone
say that out loud before!

24:48.925 --> 24:51.228
God! God, you're brave.

24:53.744 --> 24:56.181
So, look. This Iron Witch. Do you know

24:56.206 --> 24:58.822
- who that might be?
- Maybe. Yeah.

24:58.961 --> 25:01.197
And would it be so illegal

25:01.222 --> 25:04.556
- for you to get me her address?
- Uh huh!

25:04.658 --> 25:06.486
Super illegal.

25:07.195 --> 25:09.562
But, you know, if I just
happened to blow off work

25:09.587 --> 25:12.287
and we sort of pass by...

25:12.846 --> 25:14.252
You'd do that, for me?

25:14.312 --> 25:17.221
- I'd do a lot of things to you.
- For... for me.

25:17.270 --> 25:19.703
Yup! That too. Mhm.

25:19.791 --> 25:22.058
You know,

25:22.099 --> 25:23.994
sheriff Haught?

25:24.056 --> 25:26.356
You always smell like
vanilla dip donuts.

25:28.029 --> 25:29.908
They're my favorite.

25:38.477 --> 25:39.891
Dolls?

25:41.266 --> 25:43.147
- Dolls!
- Help...

25:43.672 --> 25:45.399
Help!

25:48.415 --> 25:50.087
Hey, it'll be fine.

25:50.290 --> 25:52.133
Oh, god. That is a lot of blood

25:52.158 --> 25:54.001
- for a shoulder wound...
- It's too late.

25:54.767 --> 25:56.891
- It's too late, alright?
- Hey, don't say that, OK?

25:56.916 --> 26:00.110
- Don't say that!
- Jeremy... locate the asset.

26:00.151 --> 26:01.681
- What? No. No! I'm not...
- Complete the mission.

26:01.705 --> 26:05.743
Complete the mission, OK?

26:05.993 --> 26:07.313
I killed him!

26:07.338 --> 26:09.572
I killed Doc.

26:09.853 --> 26:11.786
But it felt... empty.

26:15.434 --> 26:17.227
I think he was my friend.

26:20.743 --> 26:22.709
Wait, Dolls.

26:25.152 --> 26:27.252
Wynonna...

26:28.219 --> 26:30.887
No, no, no! Dolls! Dolls!

26:33.222 --> 26:35.656
So, you think this world
is under a spell?

26:35.769 --> 26:38.303
What, like Narnia or Mar-a-Lago?

26:39.031 --> 26:41.493
- Sorry, it's... it's just...
- Right?

26:41.923 --> 26:43.533
Why would you wish for
something like this?

26:43.557 --> 26:45.274
Hey, I don't get it either.

26:45.469 --> 26:47.719
Look at me! My life is shit.

26:48.701 --> 26:50.118
And Mattie's still dead.

26:50.143 --> 26:51.454
Mattie Perley.

26:51.479 --> 26:54.280
Your sister. She was...
Was killed by a freak,

26:54.765 --> 26:56.469
calls himself the Jack of Knives.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.526
What, the serial killer?

26:59.707 --> 27:01.446
I'm so sorry.

27:01.747 --> 27:03.743
I just wanted to change the past.

27:03.974 --> 27:06.462
The entire timeline...
But wishes are literal.

27:07.091 --> 27:08.991
I wished your sister gone and...

27:09.275 --> 27:11.108
The universe erased her entirely.

27:11.712 --> 27:13.188
Wynonna?

27:13.425 --> 27:14.641
Do you remember?

27:14.666 --> 27:16.684
No. People have been saying
her name to me all day.

27:16.708 --> 27:19.524
Oh, yeah. "People"
touched by the demonic?

27:20.112 --> 27:22.045
And Doc Holliday.

27:22.225 --> 27:23.837
Your friend.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.883
He grabbed the trophy at the
exact moment I made the wish.

27:28.221 --> 27:29.774
Kept him immune from it;

27:29.869 --> 27:32.269
Helped him retain his memories.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.627
This spell is only cheap glamour.

27:36.708 --> 27:39.580
This demon is in way over
his grain sack head.

27:40.444 --> 27:41.649
The Marzaniok?

27:41.674 --> 27:43.741
- OK.
- Wait. How did I know that?

27:43.766 --> 27:46.400
- Just take your hands off her.
- No. I can't let her go now.

27:46.425 --> 27:48.704
- I've waited too long.
- I need to leave.

27:48.729 --> 27:50.381
- No! No!
- Come on.

27:50.899 --> 27:51.954
OK, wait!

27:51.979 --> 27:54.446
Look, I have been working
on a reversal spell.

27:54.859 --> 27:57.883
It's not much, but I can lift the
glamour for several seconds.

28:00.941 --> 28:02.493
<i>Peel zuruck</i>

28:02.518 --> 28:05.050
<i>ist die falsche welt, in und</i>

28:05.075 --> 28:06.977
<i>die anderen!</i>

28:09.721 --> 28:11.547
Oh, my god.

28:11.729 --> 28:13.729
This is my fault.

28:14.505 --> 28:17.239
I gave you the trophy
with the Marzaniok.

28:17.397 --> 28:18.610
Because I tricked you.

28:18.635 --> 28:20.902
And then Wynonna was erased.

28:21.511 --> 28:23.016
Wynonna!

28:23.469 --> 28:24.602
Warm and funny...

28:24.668 --> 28:27.352
- Insanely protective.
- Hair like a mare

28:27.377 --> 28:29.377
with a Hollywood stylist.

28:30.617 --> 28:32.243
And then...

28:32.320 --> 28:34.040
I betrayed her.

28:34.126 --> 28:36.794
Because I love you.

28:38.446 --> 28:39.914
Wait. Wait!

28:40.308 --> 28:42.469
Agh! It's gone!

28:42.863 --> 28:44.477
But not the memory of the memory.

28:44.502 --> 28:45.569
So that was why.

28:45.594 --> 28:47.446
Doc Holliday was looking
for that trophy.

28:47.471 --> 28:50.641
He wanted to break the spell.
OK. Can we do that?

28:50.666 --> 28:52.800
Enough fire can break anything.
But the trophy

28:52.825 --> 28:56.219
was stolen years ago. It's
at revenant ground zero.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.438
We'll never make it past the front gate.

28:58.463 --> 29:00.438
That... the homestead's impenetrable.

29:00.526 --> 29:02.359
That's what Daddy always said.

29:03.214 --> 29:05.227
Then someone proved him wrong.

29:05.306 --> 29:09.329
You said I was an angel. My angel...
to be exact.

29:09.441 --> 29:10.915
Let's TBD that part for now.

29:10.940 --> 29:12.751
Whatever my Angel wants.

29:12.908 --> 29:15.675
To get on the Earp homestead.

29:20.215 --> 29:23.216
You're too young to be the heir yet.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.070
Where is the gun?

29:25.095 --> 29:27.329
And your lineage isn't exactly pure...

29:27.812 --> 29:29.305
Please!

29:29.338 --> 29:30.813
- Concentrate.
- Yeah.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.967
OK? I need your help

29:34.423 --> 29:37.257
because it's crawling with revenants.

29:37.814 --> 29:39.914
Like you.

29:42.387 --> 29:44.353
The talisman was never dug up.

29:46.008 --> 29:47.688
Be a dear and...

29:47.836 --> 29:49.133
Untie me?

29:54.718 --> 29:57.165
I like your boots. I want your boots.

30:24.868 --> 30:26.500
You lost, little boy?

30:26.612 --> 30:28.399
Lower your weapon!

30:28.487 --> 30:29.946
You greet a girl, you don't

30:29.971 --> 30:32.938
- point your shooter at her.
- So you're the asset?

30:36.595 --> 30:38.595
Call me Rosie.

30:40.655 --> 30:43.344
Deputy Marshall Dolls
didn't make the rendezvous.

30:43.481 --> 30:46.416
- Does that mean that he...
- Uh... yeah.

30:49.382 --> 30:51.683
- How?
- Doc Holliday.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.462
He's dead too.

30:53.800 --> 30:56.245
Good.<i> Ponente.</i>

30:56.818 --> 31:00.281
Hey, uh... I think Black
Badge has been lying to us.

31:00.306 --> 31:02.419
Oh, a Government Agency? Never.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.368
No. Black Badge is obsessed

31:04.393 --> 31:06.293
with harnessing the power
of the paranormal.

31:06.709 --> 31:09.118
Like a bunch of cursed
outlaws who can't die?

31:09.143 --> 31:11.310
And Holliday said the
fabric of space and time

31:11.335 --> 31:13.502
has been compromised. No, no!
He knew things.

31:13.826 --> 31:15.893
- That's crazy.
- OK, hey.

31:15.895 --> 31:18.337
Tell me how you ended up
working for Black Badge.

31:18.362 --> 31:19.861
Tell me how you were
embedded in Doc's gang.

31:19.885 --> 31:22.133
Hell, tell me what you
ate for breakfast.

31:22.992 --> 31:24.454
I...

31:27.673 --> 31:29.883
I... I can't.

31:30.551 --> 31:32.782
No. No, that... that...
That's impossible.

31:32.868 --> 31:34.934
No, no, no. Not with mind-altering drugs

31:34.959 --> 31:36.611
in the town's water supply.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.627
Drugs? Like the drugs I was
cooking at the homestead?

31:39.652 --> 31:42.319
Yes, exactly! That... That
is probably where they're

31:42.344 --> 31:44.578
projecting their simulation from.

31:45.353 --> 31:47.869
Dolls' life isn't the
only one that's a lie.

31:48.564 --> 31:50.060
Those bastards.

31:50.062 --> 31:52.496
They're gonna pay for this.

31:53.892 --> 31:55.532
Do you know how to wire RDX?

31:55.799 --> 31:58.400
Can a Dothraki outride
any knight in Westeros?

31:58.537 --> 31:59.916
What?

32:00.068 --> 32:02.377
Yes. Yes I do. I...

32:03.916 --> 32:05.142
OK.

32:05.144 --> 32:06.752
Rise, my Demon,

32:06.785 --> 32:09.019
my Husband, my Master.

32:09.102 --> 32:12.170
Show of yourself and come to reclaim.

32:12.265 --> 32:13.783
All that was lost

32:13.807 --> 32:15.840
you shall once more regain.

32:19.035 --> 32:21.069
Why isn't it working?

32:21.281 --> 32:22.978
Why is he silent?

32:23.681 --> 32:25.873
Ugh! Get up.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.924
This spell that made the heir disappear?

32:27.949 --> 32:29.533
There are holes in it.

32:32.672 --> 32:34.638
We are running out of time.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.455
Give me the rings.

32:46.552 --> 32:47.931
Reveal thee,

32:47.991 --> 32:50.752
or be forever entombed. Left to rot,

32:51.455 --> 32:54.058
having been your own doom.

32:56.494 --> 32:57.728
Well?

32:57.791 --> 32:58.830
Speak!

32:58.855 --> 33:01.705
He's not here. Someone moved him.

33:02.181 --> 33:03.867
We have been betrayed.

33:06.705 --> 33:08.330
Seems to run in the family.

33:08.388 --> 33:11.555
Oh shut up. You're weak, failing.

33:11.681 --> 33:14.382
You deserved to be left behind!

33:16.715 --> 33:18.715
Where is our Husband, Sister?

33:19.218 --> 33:20.955
I cannot say.

33:21.107 --> 33:23.073
But the rings know who will.

33:25.924 --> 33:27.439
Wait.

33:28.668 --> 33:30.064
Wait.

33:30.488 --> 33:32.236
No. If I...

33:32.344 --> 33:34.963
Bring the Sister, the Heir,
back into existence...

33:35.048 --> 33:38.095
Well, that would be tap, tap,
tap, a nail in my coffin.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.017
What is this, slam poetry night?

33:40.042 --> 33:42.008
Ha. She's funny.

33:42.815 --> 33:44.213
You should keep her.

33:44.340 --> 33:46.767
Bobo, please help me.

33:46.879 --> 33:48.025
Oh.

33:48.687 --> 33:51.421
I know I said I would never hurt you.
But that was before...

33:59.332 --> 34:01.181
Dig under the hamster.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.830
Pikachu?

34:08.022 --> 34:09.291
OK.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.313
The talisman is neutralizing the ground.

34:16.916 --> 34:20.143
Remove it, and Ammolite
will be reactivated,

34:20.338 --> 34:21.728
and the revenants

34:21.860 --> 34:23.213
will be blown off the land,

34:23.237 --> 34:25.060
like dried leaves.

34:26.918 --> 34:29.621
Robert.

34:29.889 --> 34:32.656
Oh, Robert.

34:42.594 --> 34:44.201
Faster.

34:45.915 --> 34:47.071
Faster!

34:47.072 --> 34:48.972
OK!

34:48.974 --> 34:51.275
Bobo Del freakin' Rey?

34:51.511 --> 34:53.175
Holy shit, Bobo's back!

34:53.199 --> 34:55.234
Boys, Bobo's back! This
is Holliday house.

34:55.572 --> 34:58.105
We follow Doc and Doc only.

34:59.559 --> 35:01.526
Bobo's back, boys!

35:09.161 --> 35:11.228
Fight for Bobo! You hear me?

35:11.230 --> 35:13.897
Fight for Bobo! Fight for Bobo!

35:13.899 --> 35:15.866
We need to fight for Doc!

35:18.304 --> 35:19.708
- How's it going down there?
- Ugh!

35:19.733 --> 35:20.807
The ground is frozen!

35:20.832 --> 35:22.596
What the hell are you bitches doing?

35:24.157 --> 35:26.991
- OK, we gotta go.
- Yeah, to the barn.

35:27.079 --> 35:29.629
I'm not leaving without that trophy!
Come on.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.386
Go! Go!

35:40.443 --> 35:42.410
Oh god, you're so cool, Haught!

35:49.095 --> 35:51.068
Oh, my god!

35:51.070 --> 35:53.070
OK, quick!

35:54.891 --> 35:56.773
Go! Go!

36:00.745 --> 36:02.678
Do not shoot that thing in here

36:02.703 --> 36:04.107
or else this whole place blows!

36:04.132 --> 36:05.629
'Cause there's drugs and explosives?!

36:05.654 --> 36:07.584
What are you, Jeremy? Some
kind of double agent?!

36:07.608 --> 36:09.169
I am barely a single agent!

36:09.710 --> 36:11.943
Sheriff Haught, we believe
Black Badge has gone rogue.

36:11.968 --> 36:14.718
You think that's bad? We need
to find a big hockey trophy!

36:14.858 --> 36:16.007
What?!

36:16.069 --> 36:17.608
Well, it's much worse than it sounds.

36:17.937 --> 36:19.538
BBD is probably listening in right now.

36:19.563 --> 36:21.562
Probably on their way
here to annihilate us.

36:21.587 --> 36:23.653
Naw, they'll just send
in Tomahawk missiles.

36:27.670 --> 36:29.860
Hi Per.

36:29.885 --> 36:33.178
Uh, yeah. Sure, raspberry
cream sounds great.

36:33.243 --> 36:36.241
Listen, I can't really talk. I'm
in a barn wired to explode.

36:37.210 --> 36:39.053
Also, I think I'm gay. Call you later?

36:56.069 --> 36:57.374
Hi, Robert.

36:58.866 --> 37:00.370
Or do you prefer Bobo?

37:00.749 --> 37:03.108
Well? Aren't you gonna say anything?

37:03.331 --> 37:05.331
Where's a bear trap
when you need one, huh?

37:05.749 --> 37:08.011
What has gotten hot
sauce in their panties?

37:08.132 --> 37:10.046
Victorian Secret models,
Black Lace edition.

37:10.071 --> 37:12.071
What, the... the widows?
What do they want?

37:12.384 --> 37:14.236
And why do I suddenly know
they're called the widows?

37:14.260 --> 37:16.834
I'm not waiting to find out.
There's a trophy behind

37:16.859 --> 37:17.929
the wheelbarrow, if that helps.

37:17.953 --> 37:19.327
What? Oh!

37:22.269 --> 37:23.970
- Whoa, no, no! Rosie, no!
- No, wait!

37:24.533 --> 37:25.908
Get her!

37:25.941 --> 37:28.108
Oh! What?

37:28.339 --> 37:29.947
Oh, god! Oh.

37:30.098 --> 37:32.478
- Oh. Is she...
- I'm sorry, Jeremy.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.681
Guys! Guys, I found it!

37:37.149 --> 37:39.674
Get in that barn! Get the
hell in that barn, boys!

37:39.699 --> 37:41.130
- Get in that barn!
- It's too late.

37:41.155 --> 37:43.273
- We're not going to make it.
- No, no, no! I cannot die!

37:43.297 --> 37:44.939
I've only has sex one and a half times!

37:44.964 --> 37:46.183
God, that was out loud.

37:46.185 --> 37:48.135
- Guys, we're not gonna die.
- OK. Waves,

37:48.160 --> 37:50.197
I love your optimism, but...

37:50.222 --> 37:52.124
But there's no way out.

37:52.149 --> 37:54.049
Right. Unless we die.

37:54.219 --> 37:55.814
- Knock it down!
- Jesus!

37:55.886 --> 37:58.107
- Jesus! Watch that thing, Jeremy!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

37:58.131 --> 37:59.566
- I know how to get her back.
- Who?!

37:59.590 --> 38:02.180
Wynonna. I just hope it's
not too late. Listen.

38:02.205 --> 38:03.839
What happens if we detonate the RDX?

38:03.864 --> 38:06.610
- Your basic fire and brimstone.
- The Iron Witch said

38:06.635 --> 38:08.715
if we destroy the trophy with...
with fire...

38:08.740 --> 38:11.059
- Then spell is broken.
- And Wynonna returns.

38:11.084 --> 38:13.434
OK. I am a super brain
and I have no idea

38:13.459 --> 38:15.254
what you two are talking about!

38:15.418 --> 38:17.559
Dying may be our only chance of living.

38:18.207 --> 38:19.403
Who's in?

38:19.428 --> 38:21.074
No, no, no.

38:21.715 --> 38:23.957
Where you go, I go.

38:29.582 --> 38:31.391
For Wynonna.

38:31.648 --> 38:33.281
For Wynonna.

38:34.736 --> 38:37.840
I don't even know who that
is, and I don't even care...

38:37.935 --> 38:40.169
Oh, god! Yup! Yes!

38:40.398 --> 38:42.531
Yeah, for Wynonna! Why not?

38:52.245 --> 38:53.839
Ooh!

38:54.032 --> 38:57.417
Not dying single! Yeah, fingers crossed.

38:57.551 --> 39:00.583
We're back... You're OK.

39:00.608 --> 39:03.870
- I am so, so sorry, times infinity!
- Sh!

39:04.792 --> 39:07.893
Dolls, Doc... we have to
find out if they made it.

39:08.815 --> 39:10.062
We know Bobo did.

39:10.292 --> 39:11.306
Or did he?

39:11.331 --> 39:12.792
How can he even be back?

39:13.284 --> 39:16.229
And, and, and which
timeline are the widows in?

39:16.604 --> 39:19.206
The thing is, we won't know if
the spell was truly reversed

39:19.231 --> 39:20.690
- until...
- Until what?

39:21.645 --> 39:23.339
Until we find Wynonna.

39:27.016 --> 39:28.382
The spell...

39:29.031 --> 39:30.604
But I'm still here.

39:30.925 --> 39:32.393
Not down there.

39:32.490 --> 39:34.258
He's crazy. He doesn't know anything.

39:34.282 --> 39:35.815
In all the years

39:36.140 --> 39:37.956
I spent digging for those bones

39:37.981 --> 39:39.425
of the old Stone Witch's sons.

39:39.450 --> 39:40.870
I'm bored!

39:41.055 --> 39:43.689
- Just torture him already.
- I dug

39:43.808 --> 39:47.387
and I dug and I dug,

39:47.970 --> 39:49.676
and then I found it.

39:51.185 --> 39:52.895
Clootie's coffin.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.668
You tell us where it is,

39:54.693 --> 39:56.850
or there will be no end
to the cuts I make

39:56.875 --> 39:59.239
on this fragile body of yours.

40:00.917 --> 40:02.567
No.

40:05.265 --> 40:06.910
There is no pain

40:07.041 --> 40:09.141
and no torture that you can think of

40:09.276 --> 40:11.343
that I haven't already been through.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.215
And I will not, and
cannot, go back to hell.

40:14.326 --> 40:17.106
And honey, old Clootie

40:17.337 --> 40:20.071
has the power to make
sure I never do again.

40:20.634 --> 40:23.481
We cannot make promises
on behalf of our Lord.

40:23.844 --> 40:25.926
But we're very good at convincing.

40:27.193 --> 40:30.270
How can we possibly trust you,
after everything you've done?

41:01.153 --> 41:03.220
Bye-bye, seal number three.

41:03.292 --> 41:06.559
Oh! I can feel him. He's coming.

41:06.609 --> 41:09.108
God, it's like your wedding
night all over again.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.933
Shall we?

41:15.499 --> 41:16.832
Yeah.

41:19.163 --> 41:21.597
...is a plate, which means if we...

41:21.918 --> 41:24.252
Something's different.

41:24.428 --> 41:26.668
For one thing, I've got
grass in my thong.

41:30.059 --> 41:31.910
Were you out, too?

41:42.187 --> 41:43.692
This is nice.

41:44.702 --> 41:46.868
What if we just stay here, huh?

41:47.346 --> 41:49.346
Just you and me?

41:56.342 --> 41:57.950
Bobo?

41:59.250 --> 42:01.090
I am a sucker for a reunion.

42:03.081 --> 42:04.278
Shit.

42:13.682 --> 42:15.489
Oh! The third seal.

42:16.559 --> 42:18.685
They broke it.

42:19.635 --> 42:21.568
Now we're all gonna buy it.

42:25.735 --> 42:27.653
Not now. Please.

42:27.826 --> 42:29.159
Oh, hold on. Hold on.
