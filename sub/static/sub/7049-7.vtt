00:02.670 --> 00:04.420
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:04.505 --> 00:07.006
You and I'd make a lot more money
as partners than as enemies.

00:07.091 --> 00:08.716
"Partners" just means that,

00:08.801 --> 00:12.178
well, we do all the work
while you make all the money.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.514
Should I be putting my hands up
or something?

00:14.598 --> 00:16.683
Gary doesn't realize you were gonna
kill him anyway.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.101
I don't care where you go.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.353
I'd leave the country,
but that's entirely up to you.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.146
Here. This is for you.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.065
Fill, please.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.492
Our Oxy clinic got hit this morning.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.286
I need to know everything I can
about what transpired.

00:37.371 --> 00:41.457
The people who bank with me are the ones
who have access to the things I know.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.793
It may be a coincidence,
but a few hours after the hit,

00:43.877 --> 00:45.878
Raylan Givens shut down our trailer.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.088
That's not a bad trade-off.

00:47.172 --> 00:50.383
Losing a clinic but smoking out
a dirty marshal in the process.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.510
You still don't even know
what you done, do you?

00:52.594 --> 00:56.222
You gonna make sure
whoever you used to hit that clinic

00:56.306 --> 00:58.266
is either dead or silent.

00:59.977 --> 01:05.272
Never listen to me. No, they never listen.
Not one lick. Not one damn lick.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.775
Independent. They're all the same nowadays.

01:07.860 --> 01:11.446
Bunch of bullshit.
Damn woman always talking back.

01:11.530 --> 01:15.491
Never listen to the man in the house.
Independent. Independent.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.785
Limehouse?

01:19.121 --> 01:21.581
Get out here, son of a bitch.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.501
This shit ain't gonna happen again.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.171
Limehouse?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.465
You hear me?

01:37.306 --> 01:39.849
You don't look like Limehouse.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.018
No.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.729
Then I'd get out of my way, I was you.

02:01.497 --> 02:04.373
- Look what the cat drug in.
- 'Bout damn time.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.292
You couldn't pick up a phone
and tell me what's what?

02:06.668 --> 02:08.586
I know, man. I'm sorry.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.672
- Shit's been crazy.
- Yeah, it looks like it.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.926
Bernard, you reckon there were
any blues waiting in the wings,

02:15.010 --> 02:17.178
- watch Mr. Dodd cross into Noble?
- No.

02:17.262 --> 02:20.223
No one knows I'm here.
Look, I did the job we agreed on.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.809
The law's hunting me.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.353
If Quarles knows I did this, I'm a dead man.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.855
This holler's the only safe place I got.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.066
Least till I heal up some.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.277
Come on, man.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.950
Sure. You did the right thing
coming back here.

02:42.162 --> 02:46.666
Come on! No, no, no, man! Come on!
No, please! No, man, no! Come on! Please!

02:46.750 --> 02:48.626
Hey, hey, hey. Let him go.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.673
Come here, Mr. Dodd.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.218
You sit down right here.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.304
Come on. There you go. Sit right on up here.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.265
Yep.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.772
Now, I done heard what Errol got you into.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.193
I'm sure it seemed like a surefire
way to make some coin,

03:14.278 --> 03:16.571
branch out a little bit, right?

03:17.614 --> 03:19.448
You can nod if you understand.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.704
In Errol's attempt to branch out,

03:24.788 --> 03:27.540
he left out one little, small step.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.585
Forgot to run the plan by me.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.086
And the shit went bad.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.798
And the law's after you.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.468
And now we got ourselves a situation,
don't we?

03:42.097 --> 03:44.348
Yeah, we can work it out.

03:44.433 --> 03:48.895
Errol's way, or you can rest up in this holler,

03:48.979 --> 03:51.230
lick your wounds, stay away from the law.

03:51.315 --> 03:55.318
And then you go right on back to Mr. Quarles
with your tail 'tween your legs,

03:55.402 --> 03:59.989
and you tell him this whole thing
was your idea to get back at the Crowders,

04:00.782 --> 04:04.035
and you thought he would approve.
How that sound?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.996
Sounds good.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.999
- That it?
- Not quite.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.252
See, I'm gonna want to know
what Mr. Quarles is up to.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.755
I believe you can help me out there, huh?

04:18.425 --> 04:21.260
Good. Hey, I'm glad we're on the same page.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.598
What is it?

04:25.682 --> 04:29.602
Got some old white fool down the road
yelling for Mr. Limehouse.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.522
Watch him.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.666
State your business, Mr. Givens.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.169
You know what I'm here for.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.591
As long as you have known me,
have I ever been the kind to play dumb?

05:02.302 --> 05:06.305
I ain't here for blood-letting,
but if that's what it comes to, I'm ready.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.392
- See, that's that alcohol talking.
- I ain't had one drop.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.061
You'd best retrace your steps.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.522
That way history doesn't have
to repeat itself.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.775
I'm not leaving till you send
one of your lapdogs up in that maze

05:17.859 --> 05:20.027
and bring back my Frances.

05:20.529 --> 05:23.948
Frances? Frances?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.993
I know she's up there.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.119
Frances!

05:30.580 --> 05:32.748
Either you go get her, or I will.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.919
Mr. Givens, I assure you,
Frances is not on this property.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.301
Who's Frances?

05:45.554 --> 05:47.680
It's the man's late wife.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.974
What you want to do with him?

06:17.502 --> 06:19.253
- What can I get you?
- Some sleep.

06:19.337 --> 06:23.049
Can't get you that. You could drink
till you pass out. Would that help?

06:23.133 --> 06:24.425
It might.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.559
- We haven't met yet. I'm Lindsey.
- Raylan.

06:33.643 --> 06:37.063
I know. Kent said any brawls break out,

06:37.147 --> 06:39.857
call the cowboy upstairs
and see how long they last.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.735
And for that, I get free NFL Sunday Ticket.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.737
And tonight, your first drink is free.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.073
Well, I got that going for me as well.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.075
- What can I pour for you?
- Bourbon, please.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.537
Hi. Can you settle a bet for us?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.540
We've seen you
in here the past couple nights,

06:56.625 --> 07:00.669
and we want to know if you were born
before disco or after?

07:04.591 --> 07:06.092
You ladies have a good night.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.010
Come on. Don't be a sourpuss.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.514
Let's take a shot. Three JÃ¤ger Bombs.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.766
- You want that on your tab?
- No. No, thank you.

07:13.850 --> 07:18.145
Why don't you put them on my tab?
And a Pappy Van Winkle neat for me.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.524
- Your friends?
- No.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.025
Love your new digs.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.821
Thanks. Tried a few nights at the Hilton.
Didn't work outwith my per diem.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.657
- What happened to the old place?
- Not enough closet space.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.493
Room above a bar. You sure
you can live this large on your salary?

07:32.577 --> 07:35.663
Well, the owner gave me a good deal.

07:35.747 --> 07:39.208
- In exchange for what, keeping the peace?
- Something like that.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.418
You're a bouncer in a dive bar.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.254
Just when I'm here.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.881
Isn't that gig reserved
for uniforms or retirees?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.925
Martinis are only three bucks.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.678
Marshal. Forgive me for saying this,

07:50.762 --> 07:53.347
but I think you could be doing
a whole lot better.

07:53.431 --> 07:57.143
Is that why you're here?
Set me on a course of self-improvement?

07:57.227 --> 07:59.812
- You want me to get to the point?
- I'd just as soon you'd get the hell out.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.438
I will. I just want to say this.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.607
Whatever Boyd Crowder's paying you,
I will double it.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.026
- Excuse me?
- No, no, no. You heard me.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.903
You think I'm in Boyd Crowder's pocket?

08:08.196 --> 08:11.574
Judging by your circumstances,
I would say you're an undervalued asset.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.827
Is that how they teach you
to pitch a bribe in business school?

08:15.162 --> 08:16.912
U of M. Go, Blue.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.999
Yeah, on the Detroit mob's dime.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.252
Summa cum laude. Could've gone
to Wall Street, done some real damage.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.337
I prefer working with reputable folk.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.839
Well, so do I.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.757
Which is why,
when I hear about your propensity

08:28.842 --> 08:32.260
for tooling up male hustlers,
it gives me pause.

08:32.888 --> 08:36.807
Put that one boy in a coma for three weeks
up at Woodward and 6 Mile.

08:36.892 --> 08:40.769
Not the kind of thing the bent-nose crowd
takes kindly to, I imagine.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.898
Is that why you're here? Sent into exile?

08:43.982 --> 08:45.357
Don't we all make mistakes, Raylan?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.401
But you keep making them.

08:47.485 --> 08:52.198
Waltzing in here, offering me a deal
like we're just gonna start working together.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.367
- You said no. That's fine.
- Okay.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.996
I'm sure we'll be running
into each other again real soon.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.250
I know where you live now.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.386
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.263
I need a favor.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.098
I live and breathe to do your bidding.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.558
I want to talk to your friend over at the FBI.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.186
You know, maybe you should think
about making some friends of your own.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.188
What, and miss out on conversations
like these?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.439
What do you need?

10:07.524 --> 10:09.775
I leaned on this Detroit thug,

10:09.859 --> 10:12.111
and now he's all up in my shit, so...

10:12.195 --> 10:15.406
So you have no jurisdiction to go after him.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.408
No, no, no. I don't want to go after him.

10:17.492 --> 10:20.452
I want to bury the big-toothed,
albino-looking son of a bitch.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.079
Why don't you just shoot him in the face?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.747
- Does it look like I'm being funny?
- A little bit.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.708
- You having fun?
- It's a slow morning.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.710
Good. Then you won't mind making the call.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.128
Good morning, gentlemen.

10:29.212 --> 10:33.132
I need someone to follow up
with the girlfriend in the Hopkins case.

10:33.883 --> 10:34.883
Don't everybody jump at once.

10:34.968 --> 10:35.968
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.762
As soon as I'm done looking into
this asshole over near Beaumont, okay?

10:38.847 --> 10:41.390
All right. Asshole first, girlfriend second.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.645
You are totally not gonna follow up
on that girlfriend.

10:46.730 --> 10:50.482
I was hoping you'd do it
right after you made the call.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.487
Givens turned you down.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.947
Yes, he did.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.076
So, at least we get to keep the money,

11:01.161 --> 11:04.580
which is a bit of a silver lining,
considering how low we're getting.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.457
We're not keeping the money.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.959
I'm going down to Harlan,

11:09.044 --> 11:12.004
and I'm going to offer it to someone
who won't turn us down.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.797
Boss' son is coming.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.052
The boss' son.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.723
You know, my father died
when I was a teenager,

11:22.807 --> 11:25.309
- and Theo Tonin took me in.
- I'd heard that.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.353
I think he hoped that I would be a brother

11:27.437 --> 11:29.355
to that little waste of sperm,
but that didn't pan out.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.315
You know those little burr-headed monkeys
at the zoo

11:31.399 --> 11:32.858
who sit on a stump all day, jerking off?

11:32.942 --> 11:36.528
Sammy Tonin.
Weak, stupid, scared of his own shadow.

11:36.946 --> 11:40.783
I was the son he always wanted.
He groomed me to take over someday,

11:40.867 --> 11:44.703
but now, Sammy's got the houses,
the cars, the money, the juice.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.414
And me? I'm down here.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.501
What happened?

12:00.970 --> 12:04.890
Don't worry.
I'll be back for the crown prince's arrival.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.392
And I will get us more money.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.270
I'm just gonna put a smile on my face

12:10.355 --> 12:14.358
and eat a nice plate
of steaming shit, unsalted.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.746
Well, if it ain't Raylan Givens.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.499
You finally show up here
to check on your daddy?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.835
Why would I be up here for him?

12:32.919 --> 12:38.132
Well, he took a pretty good crack upside
the head last night up in Nobles Holler,

12:38.216 --> 12:40.426
calling after your mama.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.763
- How's he holding up?
- He's recuperating.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.599
I got Ava tending to him
back up at the house.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.602
Well, I'll make sure
to pass along your concern.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.979
Sure. Do that.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.149
Well, doesn't that give you pause,

12:55.233 --> 12:57.317
him up there running around
after all these years?

12:57.402 --> 12:59.611
Just sounds like he's off his meds.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.239
And I wish you luck with that,
but that's not why I'm here.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.408
Well, what are you here for?

13:05.743 --> 13:09.204
Oh, my Lord.
Think he swallowed a peanut the wrong way.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.123
Help you with that. Come on.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.752
- Raylan.
- Johnny.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.428
Oh, my God, Raylan.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.643
Figured I owed you that one for taking
a poke at me at the Marshals Office.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.813
Well, if I try to take this conversation
vertical, can I expect more of the same?

13:34.898 --> 13:37.983
You can expect worse unless
you start talking about Robert Quarles.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.444
And if I say that
you'll need to refresh my memory?

13:40.528 --> 13:42.654
What do you think?

13:42.739 --> 13:44.990
Think I'm gonna need some ice.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.283
Ice can wait.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.494
Well, what did Quarles do
to piss you off so bad

13:48.578 --> 13:50.162
you felt the need to take it out on me?

13:50.246 --> 13:51.663
- He made assumptions.
- Such as?

13:51.748 --> 13:55.667
I'm working for you, taking orders,
doing your bidding. On the cheap, no less.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.796
Well, I could see
where that might be very upsetting.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.966
Last we spoke, I believe I made myself
clear what would happen to you,

14:03.051 --> 14:06.220
- you start dragging me into your bullshit.
- Yes, you did.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.680
And I'll even allow that I...

14:08.765 --> 14:11.183
I do have some familiarity
with Robert Quarles.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.267
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.103
But you're carrying an ill-informed notion
of my relationship with the man

14:15.188 --> 14:17.481
- you think that idea came from me.
- Am I?

14:18.441 --> 14:20.859
Look, what did folks used to say
after the war?

14:20.944 --> 14:24.279
Carpetbaggers pouring into Appalachia
like they were some Old Testament scourge,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.448
looking to take what little bit we had left.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.284
They said that hell is empty,
and all the devils are here.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.536
Your point being?

14:31.120 --> 14:35.123
This is our home, Raylan.
Now, I start to turn on my own people,

14:35.208 --> 14:38.877
however contentious at times
our relationship might be,

14:38.962 --> 14:42.089
well, that's a world that becomes so muddy
even I can't fathom it.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.886
Well, if he wasn't such a drunken loser
like his old man,

14:47.971 --> 14:50.889
we wouldn't be having this little chitchat,
would we?

14:50.974 --> 14:55.519
Well, maybe next time, I'll let
your son rot in the cell. How's that sound?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.813
Yeah, well, screw you too.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.528
What can I do for you?

15:04.612 --> 15:09.408
Well, you can start by taking a donation
for your re-election campaign.

15:09.492 --> 15:13.078
Not much of a campaign, really.
Running unopposed.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.081
Well, invest it in your next campaign, then.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.000
Or make some Band-Aid repairs

15:18.084 --> 15:20.586
on a few of those level mountaintops
that everyone's bitching about,

15:20.670 --> 15:22.421
courtesy of the sheriff's office.

15:22.505 --> 15:27.092
That way you're just not a job creator,
but an all-star to a pile of future voters.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.261
Or, hell, just do what I would do.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.681
Buy yourself a nice, new vacation home.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.768
- Who are you, son?
- Robert Quarles. Real pleasure.

15:38.521 --> 15:43.066
And just what are you looking for
in return, Mr. Quarles?

15:43.151 --> 15:44.359
Sheriff.

15:45.528 --> 15:50.407
I want you to significantly reduce
the appalling Oxy violence in Harlan.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.161
Is that all?

15:54.245 --> 15:57.039
- You're not from around here, are you?
- That obvious?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.708
- I'm a quick study.
- I can see.

16:00.084 --> 16:03.754
Reducing the violence around Oxy's
maybe not as simple as you're putting it.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.798
Actually, it is. Simple economics.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.801
If someone were to lower the price of Oxy,

16:09.886 --> 16:12.304
that would take money from the dealers,
give it back to the people.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.390
Then that would force crime to go north
where the prices are still high,

16:15.475 --> 16:18.310
and you would earn city taxes
from the operation.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.270
That's a win-win-win.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.857
And how do you plan
on lowering the prices?

16:23.941 --> 16:25.150
Details you don't need to worry about.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.445
Suffice it to say, it will be legal or appear so.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.823
I don't do business with people I don't know.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.826
You are a smart man, very smart man.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.536
So, allow this

16:39.415 --> 16:41.041
to be an introduction.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.250
Howdy.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.420
What's the stick?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.674
The stick?

16:48.758 --> 16:50.550
This here's the carrot.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.927
What's the stick?

16:54.430 --> 16:57.182
Trust me. You don't want to know the stick.

16:59.435 --> 17:03.271
Big-picture details,
we'll get to those after the re-election.

17:03.356 --> 17:08.026
In the meantime, there is one little man
that you need to crack down on right now,

17:08.111 --> 17:09.236
Boyd Crowder.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.116
I ain't accepted your deal, son.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.410
Very true.

17:16.493 --> 17:21.123
But you also ain't slid that briefcase
back across the table, now, have you?

17:36.639 --> 17:38.223
Tonin crime family tree.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.767
Names and records of anyone
with the slightest link to Quarles.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.644
- Who's Sammy Tonin?
- Boss' son.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.564
- He's in Lexington?
- Touched down about an hour ago.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.399
Heard he likes horses.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.192
I was a betting man, which I am,

17:49.277 --> 17:51.987
I'd bet that if Quarles and the boss's kid are
in town at the same time,

17:52.071 --> 17:54.030
probably not much to do with horses.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.198
Know where he's staying?

17:55.283 --> 17:58.827
Last I checked, you were a marshal, too.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.414
- I got to do everything?
- Point taken.

18:05.376 --> 18:09.421
- So, tell me, how were the horses?
- Beautiful. I found a gelding.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.923
Had to be black. My daughter's
on this whole <i>Black Beauty</i> kick.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.759
- Great job, guys. Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.219
- So this is the place.
- Home, sweet home.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.429
- Is that an MRI?
- Yeah.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.680
We're not messing around here, Sam.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.931
- What's in here?
- Storage.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.933
And good news is
we got the sheriff on board.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.269
As soon as he's re-elected, we get started.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.189
Well, what happens when he starts
turning a blind eye towards your pill mills?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.441
We're not gonna have some kind of
shit-kicker rebellion on our hands?

18:29.525 --> 18:30.525
What, are you shitting me?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.360
Less crime, more tax revenue,
what's to bitch about?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.113
They get a little testy, it'll take them
at least a year to have him recalled.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.949
- So, you're telling me we're on track?
- Yeah, other than a couple hiccups.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.659
I think we got our legs under us.
Thanks, Mike.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.453
That's good,
'cause you need to know, Bobby,

18:41.537 --> 18:45.999
you're risking life and limb
on a bunch of hillbilly, doper shit bags.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.835
Couple thousand addicts
paying a few hundred a visit,

18:48.920 --> 18:50.128
knocking out the competition.

18:50.213 --> 18:54.508
Conservative estimate, $1 million a month.
A month, Sammy.

18:54.592 --> 18:58.470
Yeah? What's that estimate gonna be
if this Fed keeps looking into you?

18:58.554 --> 19:00.597
You mean the marshal?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.724
I believe that he is a man
who can be reasoned with.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.018
- So how much you need, Bob?
- Fifty.

19:05.686 --> 19:09.231
- Jesus, man!
- What? You got to pay off the sheriff,

19:09.315 --> 19:12.943
ginning up medical histories,
procuring 1,500 MRIs.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.236
It adds up quick.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.405
Another 50 in your account.
We can swing that.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.825
What you got to remember
is Dad ain't big on second chances,

19:19.909 --> 19:21.159
and you only got one

19:21.244 --> 19:23.119
because of what he invested
in you in the first place.

19:23.204 --> 19:26.456
Tell the old man
that I do not need a second chance.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.669
That's good. Because you remember what
happened last time there were hiccups?

19:30.753 --> 19:32.045
You went a little crazy. You remember that?

19:32.129 --> 19:35.507
Have you told Mr. Duffy here
about your rent boy?

19:35.591 --> 19:36.842
About all it took to squash that?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.511
I don't think Mr. Duffy is interested
in the story. Anything else, Sam?

19:39.595 --> 19:42.347
No? Good. Then we got a lot of work to do.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.684
Sure. Sure. Mr. Duffy. Bobby, keep in touch.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.379
I can't find him.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.882
Called every hotel in the area.
He's not in any of them.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.341
Well, are you sure
you're pronouncing his name right?

20:18.426 --> 20:21.219
Tonin. Sammy Tonin. Samuel. Sam.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.889
- He's probably checked in under an alias.
- That's a possibility.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.433
- Well, do you know what it is?
- What did I tell you?

20:26.517 --> 20:27.893
Why are you giving me a hard time on this?

20:27.977 --> 20:29.811
You've already told me his name.
You told me he's here.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.980
'Cause he's under FBI surveillance,
that's why, okay?

20:32.064 --> 20:33.982
- Yeah, so what?
- So shit blows up, that's my friend's ass.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.942
- Shit's not gonna blow up.
- And according to my friend,

20:36.027 --> 20:37.736
the surveillance team knows
you're looking for him.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.573
So I tell you where Sammy is,
and then you go all Raylan on him

20:41.657 --> 20:44.075
and drag him out of some restaurant
by his nut sack, is what that means.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.660
I'm not gonna grab his nut sack
or any other part of him.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.997
I just want a word, a quiet word,

20:49.081 --> 20:53.001
to suggest that his affiliation
with Robert Quarles is ill-advised.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.378
I'll make sure I do it
somewhere no one's around.

20:55.463 --> 20:58.673
- I got mad ninja skills, buddy.
- Yeah. You know karate?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.926
And two other Japanese words.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.889
Give me five minutes.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.057
Working with an eighth grader.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.269
- Those demons let you alone last night?
- I feel fine.

21:11.354 --> 21:15.315
I told you that whole thing
was blown way out of proportion.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.942
What is that?

21:17.026 --> 21:18.693
Come on, Ava.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.779
What the hell, woman?

21:20.863 --> 21:23.114
You want something to chase 'em with?

21:23.199 --> 21:24.658
I'll get you a water back.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.117
You see this shit?

21:26.202 --> 21:28.453
Believe I'm gonna sit this one out.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.705
You're not supposed to drink on your meds.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.542
I think we can both agree after last night,
you need your meds.

21:35.169 --> 21:38.129
- Come on, Boyd.
- Can't argue with her logic.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.465
A few drinks ain't gonna hurt.

21:44.887 --> 21:48.932
Well, I didn't know we'd be entertaining
a detachment of Harlan County's finest.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.726
Boyd Crowder. Is this your establishment?

21:52.144 --> 21:55.647
Well, actually, Sheriff Napier,
it belongs to my cousin Johnny,

21:55.731 --> 21:59.150
but you and your deputies are
more than welcome nonetheless.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.235
Mooney.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.946
Got a tip
on some illegal slot machines, Boyd.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.116
Just came by to ensure that you're
in compliance with the local ordinance.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.701
Well, a task so fraught with danger,

22:07.785 --> 22:09.661
you think you boys
brought enough firepower?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.830
Let's take a look, fellas.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.581
Come on.

22:13.666 --> 22:18.670
Well, Nick, I thought you were next in line
to be the chief of police in Bennett.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.964
What happened to derail
that occupational train?

22:21.298 --> 22:25.301
Look, Napier's the man, and I do as he says.
I need this job, Boyd.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.554
Besides, I don't see
anybody else paying any better.

22:27.638 --> 22:31.683
Fire door out the back is locked, Boyd.
That's a serious violation.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.686
Well, I suppose I know better
than to ask if you are shitting me.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.187
Well, what if there's a fire in here?

22:36.272 --> 22:38.690
- How are people supposed to get out?
- Through the front door.

22:38.774 --> 22:42.193
Well, between that
and the video poker machines,

22:42.278 --> 22:44.904
it looks like we got a real problem here.

22:44.989 --> 22:48.867
All right, folks.
Gonna have to ask you to leave.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.286
This place is officially closed.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.664
- Let's move it.
- What's going on here, Nick?

22:54.749 --> 22:57.876
I know you got a son with special needs.
You need any help?

22:57.960 --> 23:00.837
Look, I ain't fishing for a bribe.
It's just business, is all.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.590
Well, if business gets slow,
you know where to find me.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.426
We know where to find you, Boyd.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.803
You'd do well to remember that.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.533
Coffee?

23:33.496 --> 23:34.621
Scratch that.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.706
- Raylan Givens?
- Yeah?

23:37.875 --> 23:40.001
Need you to come with us.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.544
What for?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.380
Let's go, Marshal.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.434
Deputy Marshal Gutterson,

23:56.519 --> 23:58.061
did Deputy Givens tell you

23:58.145 --> 24:01.064
why he was looking
into Robert Quarles and Sammy Tonin?

24:01.524 --> 24:03.900
I imagine it's 'cause he's working a case.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.571
You imagine?

24:08.656 --> 24:13.326
Well, that'll be cold comfort for your friend
in the Bureau if she's suspended as a result.

24:13.410 --> 24:16.371
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

24:16.455 --> 24:19.916
The information provided was in pursuit
of a federal fugitive.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.502
This fugitive have a name?

24:22.586 --> 24:24.629
- Anthony Turner.
- Anthony Turner?

24:24.713 --> 24:26.965
- Anthony Turner.
- Anthony Turner.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.264
Anthony Turner.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.642
Of course.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.310
Anthony Turner.

24:39.395 --> 24:44.274
Mr. Turner stole some checks
with an associate of Sammy's cousin.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.609
That was back in '97?

24:46.694 --> 24:48.153
Is there not a warrant out for him?

24:48.237 --> 24:51.281
Seriously, Chief, do I look like
I just got out of the academy?

24:51.365 --> 24:55.160
You know, the six degree of connection
crap doesn't fly with me, Deputy.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.872
Well, sometimes that's the way we have
to do things around here, Agent Barkley.

24:58.956 --> 25:01.291
We leave no stone unturned.

25:01.876 --> 25:05.044
Now, if your agents are following
Sammy Tonin on his travels here,

25:05.129 --> 25:08.006
then you're either building a case
against him, or you're trying to protect him.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.466
If you got a case, Agent,
why don't you let us help you with it?

25:10.551 --> 25:12.260
Might be fun
to be on the same side for a change.

25:12.344 --> 25:17.640
You know, all I need from you, Chief,
and your deputy here is to back off.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.601
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.437
Why? You afraid I'm gonna tip him off?

25:23.397 --> 25:26.691
Or is it because you got
a leaky ship, Agent Barkley?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.278
I've made myself clear.

25:34.950 --> 25:39.245
Must be some sort of a dick test
that all the FBI agents have to pass.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.873
You know this is the case
I was telling you about earlier, right?

25:41.957 --> 25:45.710
Yeah. But I didn't think it was gonna result
in a visit from the feebs.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.962
You want me to back off, I'll back off.

25:49.798 --> 25:54.093
Just make sure that whatever you're doing
is actually Marshal business.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.388
I'm here for you, Art.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.393
I believe I just got the green light.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.479
Is Anthony Turner even in the state?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.439
Believed to be in Peru.

26:06.523 --> 26:09.317
Well, next time you need a favor,
the answer is no.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.787
Boyd.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.755
How's Arlo doing?

26:30.839 --> 26:32.840
Errol here popped him pretty good.

26:32.925 --> 26:38.179
Well, he's up and around,
but I didn't come here to discuss Arlo.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.598
Well, what can I do for you?

26:49.650 --> 26:52.777
We do pay interest on all deposits.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.989
Albeit low, of course,
things being as they are.

26:56.073 --> 26:57.448
Not much we can do about that.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.159
Only thing I'm interested in
is a particular lawman.

27:01.996 --> 27:04.956
I think you're gonna need
to be a little more specific.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.708
Don't do that.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.876
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

27:10.045 --> 27:14.215
Now, you know the tin star
I came here to discuss is Sheriff Napier.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.175
Okay.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.636
Now, I'm gonna go out on a limb here

27:18.721 --> 27:22.432
and presume that there's someone
behind the man with the badge.

27:22.516 --> 27:26.060
And I'm guessing
that man is named Robert Quarles.

27:28.397 --> 27:31.733
Sound like you didn't even need
to come see me.

27:32.443 --> 27:35.403
- How long have you known about this?
- Not very long.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.281
But you didn't ask me about it till just now.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.117
Well, what else do you know?

27:43.329 --> 27:47.206
Just that you ain't got the means
or the muscle

27:47.291 --> 27:49.917
to beat Quarles' newfound alliance.

27:51.086 --> 27:54.213
I'm not gonna waste any more gas
coming up here

27:54.298 --> 27:55.506
for parceled-out information,

27:55.591 --> 27:59.469
so from now on, when you know something,
I know something.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.931
Or else I'm gonna close my account,

28:04.016 --> 28:08.853
and you're gonna have to deal
with a very, very disgruntled customer.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.128
Well, what do you think?

28:34.213 --> 28:35.880
Should I get two of them?

28:35.964 --> 28:38.925
That's twice the horseshit you gotta shovel.

28:40.803 --> 28:41.886
It's your call, chief.

28:42.513 --> 28:44.806
I don't know much about horses.

28:48.602 --> 28:49.852
- Agent Heller?
- Sir.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.063
- Seen Givens?
- Didn't you warn him off?

28:52.147 --> 28:56.025
If you see him, call.
If he gets within 100 feet, stop him.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.653
- I'll be at the north gate.
- Yes, sir.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.448
Why don't you go make yourself useful
or something? Find a carrot.

29:02.533 --> 29:05.243
- Where?
- I don't know. Go ask around.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.081
Sure. Yeah, I know, he's a rag to win,

29:10.165 --> 29:13.251
but he showed in the fourth
a quarter of the runs.

29:13.335 --> 29:14.919
That's right.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.505
- Hey, green boots.
- Yeah?

29:19.007 --> 29:21.384
Want to make a few extra bucks?

29:22.344 --> 29:24.011
For what?

29:24.096 --> 29:25.596
Just deliver a message.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.558
What do you mean there's a problem?
What kind of problem?

29:28.642 --> 29:30.268
It has something to do
with the horse you bought.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.603
You should go see the manager
over in the round barn.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.730
Yeah, just straight ahead.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.910
What is that? Is that gabardine?

29:49.288 --> 29:51.664
This is sharkskin. $3,000.

29:53.125 --> 29:56.752
Dearborn, Michigan Avenue, Gallo's.
You want their number? I'll give it to you.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.046
They get blood out?

29:59.882 --> 30:03.342
- You know who my father is?
- Theodore Tonin, Detroit badman.

30:03.427 --> 30:07.263
Then you know what he'll do to you
if you do anything to me.

30:07.347 --> 30:11.601
Sammy, it's "dress the part, be the part."

30:12.227 --> 30:14.312
It ain't "dress the part,
hide behind your daddy."

30:14.396 --> 30:16.397
If you're gonna kill me,
just get it over with now.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.149
Are you serious?

30:18.233 --> 30:21.819
I ain't gonna beg, all right?
Tell Quarles I didn't beg.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.907
- You think Quarles sent me?
- Who else?

30:27.910 --> 30:30.328
You know, you're the second asshole
who's accused me of being dirty.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.954
- Wait a second.
- No, you wait a second.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.998
Now, I was under the impression
you were bankrolling him.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.667
Why would you bankroll someone
if you think they wanted you dead?

30:37.044 --> 30:39.837
Wait a minute. Wait. Who are you?

30:39.922 --> 30:41.756
I'm a deputy, United States Marshal.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.510
What do you want?

30:46.845 --> 30:47.845
It's funny.

30:47.930 --> 30:52.183
I was under the impression I might have
to put a horse's head in your bed.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.728
Now I'm starting to think
you and I want the same thing.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.522
So, you ain't gonna kill me, then.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.942
Sammy, if I was gonna kill you,
you never would've turned around.

31:10.452 --> 31:14.038
Deputy. Does this mean
you've reconsidered my offer?

31:14.122 --> 31:16.415
Did you know there's
a piano teacher renting the top floor

31:16.500 --> 31:19.210
of the two-family up the block?

31:19.294 --> 31:22.380
Wouldn't a banjo teacher
be a little more appropriate?

31:23.298 --> 31:24.882
To answer your question, no,

31:24.967 --> 31:27.051
I have not gotten to know my neighbors
as of yet.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.428
You'll just have to take my word for it, then.

31:29.513 --> 31:31.639
There are piano lessons going on

31:31.723 --> 31:35.560
about 178 feet from where we are standing,
give or take.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.228
I didn't know that.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.896
Nor do I give a shit.

31:38.981 --> 31:41.649
More of a wind-instrument man, I reckon.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.901
Anyway, federal government isn't too crazy

31:43.986 --> 31:46.821
about the idea of distribution of drugs
near a schoolhouse.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.991
Gives us the power to seize property
even suspected of such use.

31:50.075 --> 31:55.288
With your history of drug arrests,
the judge wasn't too hard to convince.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.123
Tell me that's an eviction notice.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.918
Well, for simplicity's sake, sure.
Let's call it that.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.086
Twenty four hours from now,

32:02.170 --> 32:04.880
anything left in that building belongs
to the Marshals Service.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.090
So...

32:08.343 --> 32:10.636
This is how you're gonna do it?

32:11.597 --> 32:12.847
For now.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.944
Wynn. Wynn. Shut up. Just shut up.

32:27.029 --> 32:31.407
I want you to clear everything out of here
and find a new place for us to set up shop.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.575
What?

32:38.123 --> 32:41.834
They canceled the wire transfer.
The money was there, and then it wasn't.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.586
I'm the messenger.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.672
Givens got to him.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.300
I'll talk to Sammy.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.968
Just make sure our friend is still in Tulsa.

32:51.053 --> 32:52.887
- Can you do that?
- Yep.

32:57.893 --> 33:01.187
- Paint the room.
- You can't paint over bloodstains.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.900
I'll take care of it.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.084
A few hours ago,
you promised me another 50.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.835
Now, I hear I've been cutoff.
Why the change?

33:24.920 --> 33:26.420
I imagine you already know that.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.839
Well, I'm sure Raylan Givens paid you a visit,
and you just pussed out.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.883
Nothing to do with the fact
that you've spent the last 20 years

33:30.967 --> 33:32.134
looking for a way to hang me out to dry.

33:32.219 --> 33:35.262
I asked you to deal with the marshal.
You didn't deal with him.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.555
Now I will.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.308
What, you gonna pop a US Marshal?
You're crazier than I thought you were.

33:39.393 --> 33:41.060
- There are other ways to handle him.
- I'm listening.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.520
As well you should, shit bag,

33:42.604 --> 33:44.605
'cause right now I'm heading down to Tulsa
to see a pal of his.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.316
And you, next time you're someplace
where our federal friends are listening,

33:47.401 --> 33:48.818
mention that Givens came to see you,

33:48.902 --> 33:50.861
and that you believe he's in bed with a guy
from Harlan,

33:50.946 --> 33:52.738
a guy named Boyd Crowder. Say it!

33:53.699 --> 33:55.700
- Boyd Crowder.
- Good boy.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.413
Well, Shelby, how are you, my friend?

34:00.497 --> 34:02.373
Well, how do I look?

34:03.166 --> 34:05.835
Like a man who has seen better days.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.294
To better days.

34:15.971 --> 34:18.931
So, what's this about, Boyd?

34:19.474 --> 34:22.226
Well, I wanted to thank you, Shelby,

34:22.310 --> 34:25.103
for backing my story
after the explosion at the mine.

34:25.981 --> 34:30.609
I'd have been a dead man if it wasn't for you.
Didn't seem like all that much to ask.

34:30.694 --> 34:34.697
Well, I heard
they let you go not long thereafter.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.742
I'm a greeter now.

34:37.826 --> 34:40.536
I don't think I could say hello
to that many people.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.830
Are you enjoying the work?

34:43.581 --> 34:47.042
Way I understand it,
they're paying me to do it, not to like it.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.340
Well, how would you like a change
in occupation?

34:56.344 --> 34:57.303
What do you got in mind?

34:57.387 --> 35:01.724
Well, what do all men want, Shelby?
Money and power.

35:01.808 --> 35:04.643
Now, I'm a little light on money right now,

35:05.604 --> 35:09.565
but I believe I might be able
to get you access to power.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.156
Go on.

35:17.240 --> 35:21.535
There's an election coming soon,
Office of County Sheriff.

35:22.537 --> 35:25.372
- Tillman Napier's job?
- He wasn't elected for life.

35:25.707 --> 35:29.877
Now, he serves at the pleasure
of the good people of Harlan County.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.506
And I think you might be just the man
for the job.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.846
You know, people will tell you
only what they hear,

35:40.931 --> 35:43.474
you know, what somebody else
has been telling them.

35:43.558 --> 35:48.103
"The market out there is bad."
"It's terrible. It's atrocious."

35:48.188 --> 35:49.772
Now, you know what I call these people?

35:49.856 --> 35:53.984
And this may sound harsh,
but I don't mean it to. I really don't.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.361
But you know what I call them?

35:56.238 --> 35:57.404
Losers.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.242
Okay? Now, just a quick show of hands here.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.744
Now, how many people want
to be in business

36:03.829 --> 36:08.332
with someone whose personality says,
"Hey, work with me. I'm a loser"?

36:09.751 --> 36:13.587
There is a treasure trove to be had

36:13.672 --> 36:16.674
in buying and selling foreclosed properties.

36:17.551 --> 36:19.593
But you have to know the secrets.

36:20.345 --> 36:23.556
And for only $29.95, tax included,

36:23.640 --> 36:29.019
I will give you a step-by-step guide
detailing those very secrets.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.646
So we have to buy the manual?

36:32.607 --> 36:34.692
Well, yes, to get my secrets...

36:34.776 --> 36:36.527
Is this a pyramid scheme?

36:36.611 --> 36:39.238
Hey, hey. Now, the only pyramid
I am talking about

36:39.322 --> 36:41.866
is one that is built with stacks of money.

36:41.950 --> 36:45.160
Well, how come
you're not out there making millions?

36:46.955 --> 36:48.789
Well, because I like to give back.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.710
Yeah, yeah. It keeps me positive,
making more personal connections.

36:52.794 --> 36:55.337
I had a friend
who made a bundle of cash that way.

36:55.422 --> 36:59.300
Okay, did you folks hear that, now?
Sir, would you stand up and...

37:00.302 --> 37:02.720
I don't think they want to hear from me.

37:02.804 --> 37:06.807
But if you could, maybe you could share
one of your secrets with us?

37:08.727 --> 37:10.227
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

37:10.312 --> 37:14.231
Okay. Okay. I guess one won't hurt.
Thank you, sir.

37:14.316 --> 37:17.860
Now, most people think
that you have to work with an agent.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.320
How many of you have heard that?

37:19.779 --> 37:22.114
It's true. So, you have a family?

37:22.198 --> 37:25.367
- Yeah. Yeah. A wife and two kids.
- That's great.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.536
Yeah, it's awesome. How about yourself?

37:27.621 --> 37:30.539
Yeah, I mean... Well, I did, a wife.

37:32.042 --> 37:33.292
- Divorced?
- Yeah.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.376
I'm sorry.

37:34.461 --> 37:37.129
I think that's why I'm so focused
on this personal connection stuff now.

37:37.213 --> 37:40.883
I just... I had the greatest woman.

37:40.967 --> 37:43.385
I mean, the smartest, sexiest.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.805
- I blew it.
- Shit.

37:46.890 --> 37:50.309
I guess I think if I could just go back,
you know,

37:50.393 --> 37:54.897
and strengthen that personal connection,
I mean, right from the beginning...

37:54.981 --> 37:55.981
I don't know.

37:56.066 --> 37:58.192
Now, wait a minute.
Just, you know, maybe it'll happen.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.695
- Maybe you guys will work it out, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.113
Yeah.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.740
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers to that.

38:04.824 --> 38:07.201
All right. So, how did you do it?

38:09.746 --> 38:13.332
I just got lucky. Amazing wife. Great kids.

38:13.416 --> 38:16.585
- No, my problem all stems from my work.
- Yeah.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.170
I swear, I'd be running
the whole organization

38:18.254 --> 38:20.130
if it wasn't for my boss's idiot son.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.758
- Is that right?
- No, I'm serious.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.885
- We're ready.
