WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:07.275
*

00:08.842 --> 00:11.179
And here, on
Royal Street,

00:11.212 --> 00:13.147
in the famous
French Quarter,

00:13.181 --> 00:16.450
on your left you will see
America's first pharmacy,

00:16.484 --> 00:18.552
from the late 1800s.

00:18.586 --> 00:21.422
Bloodletting,
experimental surgeries,

00:21.455 --> 00:23.824
potions--
some say it was actually

00:23.857 --> 00:25.326
more of a
torture chamber.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.660
Truth is, New Orleans

00:26.694 --> 00:28.196
had the highest mortality rate

00:28.229 --> 00:30.198
than any city in those days.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.599
'Course, when you mix
all that death

00:31.632 --> 00:35.469
in a town born in chaos,
crime and culture,

00:35.503 --> 00:37.705
spirits tend to roam.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.307
Spirits like

00:39.340 --> 00:42.443
Confederate sailor
Cornelius LaRue,

00:42.476 --> 00:44.312
who plunged to his death
from that very rooftop

00:44.345 --> 00:48.149
on All Saints' Eve, 1867.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.218
Now, some say
Cornelius went crazy

00:50.251 --> 00:51.685
and jumped 'cause of the fever,

00:51.719 --> 00:53.187
but trust me,

00:53.221 --> 00:54.688
he isn't roaming the streets

00:54.722 --> 00:56.457
till this day
'cause he was sick.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.592
He was murdered.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.095
(people gasp, shriek)

01:04.798 --> 01:07.268
(screams)

01:11.605 --> 01:14.242
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:14.275 --> 01:16.710
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:16.744 --> 01:19.280
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:19.313 --> 01:20.481
* How, how, how, how

01:20.514 --> 01:22.583
* Hey, hey

01:28.689 --> 01:30.258
* You gotta come on.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.494
* Tough in the center

01:33.527 --> 01:35.596
* Never questioned I got spine

01:35.629 --> 01:37.398
* Walk in to the room

01:37.431 --> 01:40.268
* Heads turning on a dime

01:40.301 --> 01:41.735
* Diamond in the rough

01:41.769 --> 01:43.571
* Workin' my way up

01:43.604 --> 01:46.340
* No, you never thought that
I would rise to the top... *

01:46.374 --> 01:48.242
Percy, hold up.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.144
Yo, Son. Hey.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.345
Huh?
(music quiets)

01:51.379 --> 01:53.147
I tried calling you.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.549
Could have swooped by and
picked you up on the way here.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.286
No, the new apartment's
right around the corner, so...

01:58.319 --> 02:00.154
Oh, right, of course.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.356
You guys are all moved in.
You need some help,

02:02.390 --> 02:04.258
maybe hanging pictures
or something?
No, we're good, thanks.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.926
Morning, Sonja,
Chris.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.595
Morning.
Morning.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.330
* Don't give a damn
how you feel *

02:09.363 --> 02:11.332
* I'll get there on my own

02:11.365 --> 02:14.268
* Armor made of steel
on the fire. *

02:14.302 --> 02:15.803
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.405
Witnesses?

02:17.438 --> 02:19.207
Ghost tour.
Rotary club from Minnesota.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.609
They all saw the same thing and
thought it was part of the act,

02:21.642 --> 02:23.777
at first. Tour guide
knew better, though.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.279
What do we know
about our victim?

02:25.313 --> 02:26.380
GREGORIO:
Jacob Anderson,

02:26.414 --> 02:28.416
Petty Officer Third Class.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.284
Hospital corpsman
from Norfolk.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.686
Arrived in town three days ago
on emergency leave.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.522
Any idea why?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.924
No, I'm still waiting
to hear back from his command.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.427
Witnesses say whether they think
he, uh, fell or jumped?

02:39.460 --> 02:40.961
They don't know.
They're all just freaked out.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.830
SONJA: Yeah, I don't
blame 'em. On a ghost tour,

02:42.863 --> 02:44.698
and a guy falls from
the same building

02:44.732 --> 02:47.401
a Confederate sailor
jumped from 150 years ago?

02:47.435 --> 02:50.938
Or was pushed.
That's why Cornelius LaRue

02:50.971 --> 02:52.840
still roams the streets
of New Orleans today,

02:52.873 --> 02:54.442
looking for justice.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.310
Ain't that
right, Percy?
Stop.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.579
What are you talking about?
Who's this, uh, Cornelius LaRue?

02:58.612 --> 03:00.948
This happened before?
PRIDE: Right after
the Civil War.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.716
Part of New Orleans history.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.719
City lore we take seriously,
and rightfully so.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.721
Yep, including ghosts.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.723
Yeah, well, that probably
explains all the extra creeps

03:09.757 --> 03:11.459
that have been hanging around.
See this one right here?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.760
Had to tell him twice
to stay away

03:12.793 --> 03:14.628
from the vic before
they put the tape up.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.797
Said he's some kind of
spirit chaser or something.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.999
Still, Gregorio, hey, you should
check out the ghost tour.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.934
I mean, it's part
of the city's history.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.471
You don't know much about it.
Hey, free daiquiris, too.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.906
Daiquiris, I'm good with.
Ghosts, not so much.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.609
Oh! Hello!

03:28.642 --> 03:30.344
What did I tell...
Don't you have

03:30.378 --> 03:32.012
any respect for the dead?

03:32.045 --> 03:34.382
(laughs)

03:35.383 --> 03:36.650
PRIDE:
Talk to me.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.352
Well, it's a fractured skull,
broken ribs,

03:38.386 --> 03:40.421
legs, internal bleeding.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.623
It's all consistent
with a four-story fall

03:42.656 --> 03:44.292
onto unforgiving stone.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.560
Corpsman Anderson
died on impact.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.028
Any idea if it was
an accident, or...

03:48.061 --> 03:49.930
Suicide? No, not yet.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.400
Uh, however,
there is a third option.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.503
I found abrasions and
contusions on the arms,

03:55.536 --> 03:56.904
uh, hands, face,

03:56.937 --> 03:58.839
not consistent
with the end result.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.643
Defensive wounds-- from a fight?

04:02.676 --> 04:04.378
If so, it was a recent one.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.546
Semisolid state
of coagulation

04:05.579 --> 04:07.315
indicates it began

04:07.348 --> 04:09.983
before the injuries
from his fatal fall.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.853
Question is, what was Corpsman
Anderson doing up on that roof?

04:12.886 --> 04:14.422
And if he was in a fight,

04:14.455 --> 04:16.424
was the fall an accident
or intentional?

04:16.457 --> 04:17.991
Or maybe he was pushed,

04:18.025 --> 04:20.661
just like Cornelius.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.563
You want me to check the roof?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.465
No, Sebastian's up there
already, I'll go.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.033
Find out everything you can
on our victim.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.502
Especially interested in
what brought him to New Orleans

04:28.536 --> 04:29.703
in the first place.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.004
Copy that.
Copy that.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.480
What's with them?

04:39.513 --> 04:42.550
Not sure. But whatever it is...

04:42.583 --> 04:44.284
not getting any better.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.589
SEBASTIAN:
It is not a good situation.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.924
Lot of construction materials
up here,

04:50.958 --> 04:52.693
the building owner's remodeling.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.796
Careful of all this
slippery plastic right here.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.731
Access unlocked
when you got here?

04:57.765 --> 04:58.932
No, actually,
it was propped open.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.501
Explains how our vic
got up here.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.669
Yeah, but not why.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.704
Loretta thinks
he was in a fight.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.439
From the looks of things,
seems she's right.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.840
Yeah, definitely.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.942
I'm thinking Jacob Anderson
and one person,

05:08.976 --> 05:11.445
based on the footprints
in the tar there.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.481
A lot of slipping and
sliding, but if you, um,

05:13.514 --> 05:15.115
if you look closely
there, you can see,

05:15.148 --> 05:17.084
uh, two distinct
sets of shoe prints.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.852
Right over there
by the ledge.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.458
You're gonna have to get over
your fear of heights

05:24.492 --> 05:25.726
sooner or later, Sebastian.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.994
Yeah, no.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.729
(scoffs)
Totally.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.864
Figure that's why you
sent me up here, you know?

05:30.898 --> 05:33.000
Just to work on it,
help me out.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.735
Either that or you just hate me.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.871
Anyway, uh, I found some
fresh traces of blood

05:37.905 --> 05:39.607
trailing from...

05:39.640 --> 05:41.475
that pallet.
Meaning Jacob made it

05:41.509 --> 05:44.978
halfway across the roof
before the fight started.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.880
Yeah, I'm thinking he was
surprised by his attacker, too,

05:46.914 --> 05:48.482
because the shoe prints
don't join up

05:48.516 --> 05:49.783
until right here
by the pallet.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.752
Yeah, attacker
was waiting for Jacob.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.754
Question is why?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.889
And why here, of all places?

05:55.923 --> 05:58.025
Just what this town needs:
another ghost story.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.495
(The Twilight Zone theme
playing)

06:01.529 --> 06:03.564
Okay, tell me
you hear that, too.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.174
Brandy Anderson.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.009
Hello?
BRANDY (on phone): Jacob...

06:16.043 --> 06:17.678
No, no, no, wait.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.812
Slow down.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.914
No... no...

06:20.948 --> 06:22.416
This is not Jacob.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.951
I'm a federal agent.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.053
Are you okay?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.491
Ms. Anderson?
Special Agent Pride.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.192
I'm the one who answered your
brother's phone when you called.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.894
You all right?
Yes.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.096
I just... I don't
understand what's happening.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.866
My grams-- she
was very sick.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.534
She just passed.
I came down

06:40.568 --> 06:41.835
to help Jacob with
the arrangements,

06:41.869 --> 06:43.604
and when I got here,
the door was wide open

06:43.637 --> 06:47.475
and the place was...
was torn apart.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.176
Well, it's okay,
we're gonna figure this out.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.012
Where is Jacob? Why did you
answer his phone when I called?

06:53.847 --> 06:55.983
Excuse me
for just one second.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.185
Dwayne. What's NCIS
doing here?

06:58.218 --> 07:00.020
I'll explain later.
Anything?

07:00.053 --> 07:04.057
Nah, other than somebody did a
number on the place; it's clear.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.026
You want us
to send Forensics?

07:06.059 --> 07:08.061
No, we'll handle it from here.
Thanks, G.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.597
Mm-hmm.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.601
Something happened to
my brother, didn't it?

07:17.805 --> 07:19.807
I'm so sorry.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.212
(inhales shakily)

07:41.762 --> 07:45.599
Do you think this was connected
to Jacob's death?

07:45.633 --> 07:48.569
Brandy, you shouldn't be...
No, I...

07:48.602 --> 07:50.270
I'm okay.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.239
Agent Pride, I want to help.
I want to help

07:52.272 --> 07:55.142
figure out who killed
my brother, I need to.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.879
Okay.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.081
Jacob came to town
before you did,

08:01.114 --> 08:03.183
was staying here?
Grams and Jacob

08:03.216 --> 08:05.819
were very close,
they talked all the time.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.621
Jacob came back

08:07.655 --> 08:09.823
to help her
organize her things,

08:09.857 --> 08:12.292
get the family stuff
back together.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.762
That's what meant most to Grams.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.797
And you're sure she
didn't have anything

08:16.830 --> 08:18.298
of monetary value?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.167
Mm, just some
family heirlooms.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.170
(sniffles)
Photos.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.905
Sentimental value.
(sniffles)

08:24.938 --> 08:27.307
All the money she ever had,
she used to put me

08:27.340 --> 08:29.076
through med school.

08:29.109 --> 08:33.246
And Jacob helped her
with what the Navy paid him.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.683
Grams was the only
family we had left.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.318
I can't believe
he's gone now, too.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.921
Come on, let's get you
out of here.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.790
Let me take you
back to your hotel.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.224
(air whooshing)

09:07.280 --> 09:08.782
BRANDY:
What is this?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.188
(shrieks, gasps)

09:19.860 --> 09:22.229
LASALLE: So, what,
was someone trying

09:22.262 --> 09:24.765
to conjure a ghost
with a séance? I mean,

09:24.798 --> 09:27.935
Jacob was trying to check in
with his grams or something?

09:27.968 --> 09:30.203
Everyone grieves in their
own way, Lasalle. Don't mock it.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.805
Yeah, you don't
want to mess with that.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.974
Wait a second.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.276
Are you scared of ghosts,
Gregorio?

09:36.309 --> 09:39.680
What? No, of course I'm-- no.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.382
I'm just saying we don't know
what we don't know, so...

09:42.415 --> 09:44.351
let's just focus
on what we do know, all right?

09:44.384 --> 09:45.653
Okay.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.120
SONJA:
Well, the problem is

09:47.154 --> 09:48.722
we don't know that much.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.758
Background on Jacob Anderson

09:50.791 --> 09:52.259
came back
cleaner than clean,

09:52.292 --> 09:55.328
and his commander said
his request for emergency leave

09:55.362 --> 09:57.698
was because
of his grandma's passing.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.733
So, wait, he came into town
to bury his grandmother,

09:59.767 --> 10:01.735
but got killed instead?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.837
It's got to have something to do
with her place being tossed.

10:03.871 --> 10:04.972
Was there anything
on surveillance?

10:05.005 --> 10:07.374
Camera on top of the Pharmacy
Museum across the street

10:07.407 --> 10:09.342
was inop, and no other angles
on the rooftop.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.945
All right, then we're gonna have
to backtrack his last three days

10:11.979 --> 10:14.114
in town, figure out
what drove him there.
Yeah,

10:14.147 --> 10:15.783
and who was waiting for him
when he got there.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.017
Unfortunately,
the séance

10:17.050 --> 10:19.152
seems to be our
only lead so far.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.888
Lot of shady people in this town

10:20.921 --> 10:22.790
willing to take advantage
of people's grief,

10:22.823 --> 10:25.358
and Pride said Jacob took
his grandma's death pretty hard.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.261
Yep, and maybe somebody was
trying to take advantage of him.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.964
Still doesn't explain
why he was up on that roof.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.966
No, but maybe this'll help.
I digitized the photos

10:33.000 --> 10:34.401
that Pride took from the séance,

10:34.434 --> 10:37.370
which, scientifically speaking,
is a total quack.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.006
I mean, don't get me
wrong, I love, uh,

10:39.039 --> 10:40.240
The Haunting, I love
Poltergeist--

10:40.273 --> 10:41.842
the originals, I mean,
not the remakes.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.376
You guys want to
talk about quacks?
Sebastian.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.712
They're not good movies.
What do you want me to say?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.146
The photo.
Okay, yeah.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.948
I was able to isolate a, uh,
fingerprint smudge

10:47.981 --> 10:49.983
on one of the candles--
you see it right there?

10:50.017 --> 10:52.319
Any matches?
Oh, yeah. No surprise--

10:52.352 --> 10:54.387
a, uh, con artist psychic
who is on probation

10:54.421 --> 10:56.389
for taking tourists
for everything they got.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.826
Got a name on this joker?
Name and an address.

10:58.859 --> 11:02.763
Otis Bartholomeus
the Third. He, uh, works

11:02.796 --> 11:05.432
at one of those haunted
mansions called The Mortuary.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.466
Wait a minute. Isn't that

11:06.499 --> 11:08.068
the creep from
our crime scene?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.803
Mm. Yeah.
Yeah, spirit
chaser, my ass.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.104
That's probably
our perp.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.472
All right, call Pride.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.841
He's with
Jacob's sister.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.709
Tell him we got a legit suspect.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.785
Gregorio and Sebastian, y'all
go through the front door.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.454
Percy and I'll go around back
in case y'all scare him out.
Or maybe

11:27.487 --> 11:29.256
you and Sebastian
can chase Otis out to us.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.958
Come on. Go around back.
Why? What difference

11:30.991 --> 11:32.359
does it make?
GREGORIO:
Well, maybe we should just

11:32.392 --> 11:34.828
wait for Pride anyway.
We're here.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.830
Let's do this.
Percy, you're with me.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.131
Comms open.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.133
(groans)

11:40.167 --> 11:42.002
(bird hooting,
wind chimes tinkling)

11:42.035 --> 11:43.370
Okay. All right.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.273
(loud growling,
screaming sounds playing)

11:46.306 --> 11:49.142
(skeleton prop laughing)

11:49.176 --> 11:50.978
(laughter continues)

11:51.011 --> 11:52.012
Hey, don't worry,
it's all right.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.146
Got my proton pack.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.348
That's from Ghostbusters.
You ever seen that?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.516
All right, just go. Just go.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.886
(skeleton continues laughing)

11:58.919 --> 12:02.389
(organ playing scary music)

12:02.422 --> 12:05.458
(eerie laughter,
thunder rumbling)

12:05.492 --> 12:07.327
(whispering):
Okay, you take the stairs.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.929
I'll go this way.
All right.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.764
Okay.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.199
(women screaming)

12:12.232 --> 12:15.769
Uh... you know what?
(wind howling)

12:15.803 --> 12:18.471
Probably shouldn't split up.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.307
Protocol, so...

12:20.340 --> 12:22.943
(prop gasping)

12:22.976 --> 12:25.212
Torture chamber.
How appropriate.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.882
What's that supposed to mean?
(spooky sounds continue)

12:33.053 --> 12:36.156
(eerie melody playing)

12:36.189 --> 12:37.490
(screaming sounds playing)

12:37.524 --> 12:39.059
(growling)
(screams)

12:41.461 --> 12:43.430
You are afraid of ghosts,
aren't you?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.999
(whispering):
Shh. I hear something.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.201
(piano plays upbeat tune)

12:48.235 --> 12:50.037
Cliché, but cool.
Shut up.

12:50.070 --> 12:53.506
Welcome to these Haunted Halls,
where sprits

12:53.540 --> 12:56.043
roam and...
We're not on
the tour, pal.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.445
We're federal
agents. Freeze.
Turn around, hands up.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.951
Go ahead. Go. Go.
I'm going!

13:06.586 --> 13:09.189
SEBASTIAN:
NCIS! Freeze!

13:09.222 --> 13:11.024
Con on the run.
He's coming at you.
LASALLE: Copy that.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.460
MALE PROP VOICE:
Argh, me think you're gonna die!

13:13.493 --> 13:17.797
(spooky sounds continue)

13:22.235 --> 13:25.205
(screaming sounds playing)

13:32.946 --> 13:36.316
CHILDREN:
* Ring around the rosy...

13:36.349 --> 13:38.485
Sebastian?!
* A pocketful of posies

13:38.518 --> 13:40.487
No! No! No, no!

13:40.520 --> 13:42.489
* Ashes...

13:42.522 --> 13:46.493
(screaming)

13:46.526 --> 13:49.096
NCIS! Stop!

13:52.365 --> 13:53.500
OTIS:
I didn't do anything!

13:53.533 --> 13:55.035
I'm innocent!

13:55.068 --> 13:56.569
Yeah, well, why'd
you run? Huh?

13:56.603 --> 13:58.438
Hands behind your back. NCIS.

13:58.471 --> 14:02.042
Hey, where is Gregorio?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.643
That's a good question.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.980
GREGORIO (screaming):
Sebastian?!

14:07.014 --> 14:08.348
(spooky female laughter)

14:18.025 --> 14:19.993
Found these items in his car.

14:20.027 --> 14:23.196
Watch is engraved with Jacob's
grandmother's name on it.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.398
Shouldn't be hard
to get her granddaughter

14:25.432 --> 14:27.300
to identify
the other items, too.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.037
OTIS: Okay, wait. I-I told you
I didn't ransack the house.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.604
I-I only took those i--
heirlooms

14:31.638 --> 14:33.673
to try and connect with her
after she passed.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.675
That's... that's how it works.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.211
That's why you came
to Jacob's crime scene, too?
No.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.281
No, I-I was there to try
to connect with him directly,

14:41.314 --> 14:44.151
you know, before he...
he moved on.

14:44.184 --> 14:47.955
PRIDE: We got your fingerprints
at the house.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.490
Part of a séance
that you no doubt conducted.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.192
Add these stolen goods,

14:52.225 --> 14:54.461
couple that with
your criminal record...

14:54.494 --> 14:57.030
Hard not to think that
you conned Jacob's grandmother

14:57.064 --> 14:59.399
into a séance,
robbed her.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.068
Then when Jacob came to town

15:01.101 --> 15:02.970
and found out what you did,
he came after you...

15:03.003 --> 15:05.038
Which is why you killed him.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.373
OTIS:
Just hear me, okay?

15:06.406 --> 15:08.141
F-First of all,
the old lady came to me

15:08.175 --> 15:09.476
asking for a séance.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.011
Okay? It's
not uncommon.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.013
People tend to
be more open

15:13.046 --> 15:16.283
to the other side when
they are close to it themselves.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.452
You seriously trying to tell us
you're a legit psychic?

15:19.486 --> 15:22.089
A medium. There's a,
there's a... a difference.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.490
What a crock.
Shh.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.425
Really, Gregorio?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.360
What?
First it's ghosts.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.062
Now it's psychics?
You can't really

15:29.096 --> 15:30.663
be believing this stuff? Really?

15:30.697 --> 15:32.599
I'm not alone in this.
Half this crazy town

15:32.632 --> 15:34.234
believes in this stuff.
(scoffs)

15:34.267 --> 15:36.403
Am I freaked out by it?
Yeah. I'm Catholic.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.106
Do I dismiss it? No,
because if I can't control it

15:39.139 --> 15:41.708
or explain it,
I don't like it.
PRIDE: Okay, Otis.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.177
For the sake of argument,
let's say we believe you.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.579
Why did Jacob's grandmother come
to you in the first place?

15:46.613 --> 15:48.215
I don't know.
She just said that

15:48.248 --> 15:49.749
she was trying
to solve a family secret,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.651
one-one that she'd been trying
to solve her whole life,

15:51.684 --> 15:53.520
but that she was, she was...
running out of time.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.088
LASALLE:
Secret?

15:55.122 --> 15:57.057
What secret?

15:57.090 --> 15:59.092
Well, the séance was
to figure that out.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.760
But I-I figured I'd humor her,

16:00.793 --> 16:04.764
you know, make a few bucks,
and-and then bolt, but, um,

16:04.797 --> 16:07.367
then, uh, after
she died,

16:07.400 --> 16:11.204
she started... talking to me.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.639
Oh, boy.
Here we go.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.142
OTIS: No. Look, man,
I-I didn't believe it, either.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.111
(stammers): I've... I've faked
this for a lot of years,

16:18.145 --> 16:20.680
and, uh, and I made some
decent dough doing it, too,

16:20.713 --> 16:22.649
but this time, it...

16:22.682 --> 16:24.684
(sighs)
it-it really happened.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.254
Look, all the old lady said was

16:27.287 --> 16:28.655
that she was right
about whatever the secret was,

16:28.688 --> 16:30.490
and that I had to find
her grandson

16:30.523 --> 16:32.625
and-and tell him,
because he'd understand,

16:32.659 --> 16:34.527
he would, he would
do something about it.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.796
And so I did.
I-I found him,

16:36.829 --> 16:40.367
and I told him,
and the next thing I know...

16:40.400 --> 16:42.669
he's dead.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.704
You hear this?

16:44.737 --> 16:47.674
This whole case has
the Malocchio on it.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.243
The ma... ma...?
This whole case is cursed.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.444
Name of the Father,
Son, Holy Spirit. Amen.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.779
Give me your hand.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.714
What are you doing?
Any spirits to us...

16:54.747 --> 16:57.584
You'll thank me when I'm done.
Don't attach any spirits to us.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.119
We just got
a brand-new apartment.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.154
Listen, I swear I'll
never-- I'll be good.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.157
Well, I got to admit,
that's a first.

17:04.191 --> 17:07.294
Yeah, maybe we ought to
get ourselves a Ouija board.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.263
Hey, joke all you want, but like
I said, I don't recommend it.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.631
Listen,
there's got to be something

17:11.664 --> 17:13.400
to this family secret thing,
because,

17:13.433 --> 17:16.203
whether we believe Otis or not,
Jacob apparently did.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.105
Yeah, and it was probably
what got him killed.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.439
Yeah, well, Gregorio's right.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.341
We need to figure out
what Jacob knew,

17:21.374 --> 17:23.410
and what he was trying to do.
LASALLE: Wait.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.844
You saying you
believe Otis?

17:24.877 --> 17:26.679
What I believe is,
we need to investigate

17:26.713 --> 17:28.481
this case just like any other.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.750
Follow facts,
see where the evidence leads.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.086
Yeah, what are we gonna do
with Otis?
GREGORIO: He said he was with

17:33.120 --> 17:35.222
his probation officer
the night of the murder.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.357
Easy alibi to check.
Gregorio, make the call.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.758
Okay.
Then get
his phone records,

17:38.791 --> 17:42.329
see if his story
about Grandma Anderson

17:42.362 --> 17:43.863
calling him
checks out, too.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.133
There's also the issue of
who ransacked the house

17:46.166 --> 17:47.434
if it wasn't Otis.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.102
Yeah, and what they
were looking for.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.104
Well, I might have a lead
on what Jacob was looking for,

17:51.138 --> 17:52.605
or at least where
he was looking for it.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.874
Pulled this from
his cell phone; it tracks

17:54.907 --> 17:56.876
every last location
that he went to between the time

17:56.909 --> 17:59.712
that he arrived
and the time that he... died.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.880
Well, you want me and Gregorio

18:00.913 --> 18:02.849
to retrace his steps?
PRIDE: No.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.218
No, I want you and
Christopher to do it.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.819
That's an order.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.822
Look, I don't know what's
going on between the two of you,

18:09.856 --> 18:12.692
but it's not affecting just you
anymore, so work it out.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.595
(phone beeping)

18:18.665 --> 18:20.767
Loretta thinks she might've
found something on Jacob's body.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.336
I'll let you know what.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.805
Come on, people, learn things.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.181
Prelim tox screens
came back negative,

18:34.214 --> 18:35.648
and the blood samples

18:35.682 --> 18:37.917
on the rooftop all match
Corpsman Anderson.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.486
None from the killer?

18:39.519 --> 18:41.254
Could've used gloves,

18:41.288 --> 18:43.190
or maybe just overwhelmed
Mr. Anderson,

18:43.223 --> 18:44.624
caught him off guard?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.926
Adds to the theory
the assailant was lying in wait.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.796
Still, how did
he even know

18:49.829 --> 18:52.265
that Jacob Anderson was
gonna be on that roof?
Hell of a coincidence,

18:52.299 --> 18:53.633
if you ask me.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.702
Cornelius LaRue.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.937
Loretta, please
don't tell me

18:57.970 --> 18:59.606
you believe in those
ghost stories, too.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.941
I've been on every one
of those tours in this town

19:01.974 --> 19:03.410
twice.
Loretta.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.212
I'm a coroner, Dwayne.

19:05.245 --> 19:08.715
I'd like to think that this
is not necessarily the end.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.417
Call it a coping mechanism.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.419
Learn something
new every day.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.555
Ah, speaking of something new--
I found a strain of bacteria

19:15.588 --> 19:18.458
in Mr. Anderson's lungs

19:18.491 --> 19:20.293
which I've never seen before,

19:20.327 --> 19:22.462
which is curious.
Curious how?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.198
Well, aside from the fact
that I can't identify it,

19:25.232 --> 19:28.335
Mr. Anderson's postmortem
body temperature-- normal,

19:28.368 --> 19:29.702
no fever.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.339
Means how or where
he contracted it

19:32.372 --> 19:34.307
had to have been
just before he died.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.908
It could help us figure out
what put him on the roof.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.977
You sure
you can't identify it?

19:38.010 --> 19:41.581
No, but Sebastian might be
able to, if you can spare him.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.584
Long as Christopher and Sonja
don't blow up on me, I can.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.886
Yeah. Ever find out
what's going on with those two?

19:46.919 --> 19:49.856
No, but I know I need
to nip it in the bud,

19:49.889 --> 19:51.891
both for the sake of the team
and because of HQ.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.761
HQ? What's NCIS got
to do with it?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.663
Maybe nothing, but...

19:56.696 --> 19:58.465
can't kick the feeling

19:58.498 --> 20:00.600
they're still trying
to break up the team.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.869
Just don't want
to give them any way in,

20:02.902 --> 20:04.771
any reason to come back
down here...

20:06.506 --> 20:08.808
Do I sound paranoid?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.385
SONJA:
All right, got it.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.752
We'll-we'll keep
you posted, too.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.422
So, Gregorio says
Otis's alibi checks out,

20:22.455 --> 20:24.291
so he's definitely
not the murderer.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.892
Well, that doesn't mean
he's not a con, though.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.360
Could you believe
that crap he said?

20:27.394 --> 20:31.398
I don't know.
No, I guess.

20:31.431 --> 20:35.568
But we are in the cemetery,
one of Jacob's last stops.

20:35.602 --> 20:39.038
Just one more weird thing in
this case to make you wonder.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.807
LASALLE:
Nah, it doesn't make we wonder.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.676
I mean, I believe
there's more out there

20:43.710 --> 20:46.913
than just us-- always have--
but talking to the dead?

20:46.946 --> 20:50.717
Nah. As far as we know,
we're just on...

20:50.750 --> 20:52.051
BOTH:
A wild ghost chase.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.288
(both laugh)

20:55.322 --> 20:57.657
Percy...
Let's not.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.327
We got to talk
about this.
(groans)

21:01.994 --> 21:05.565
This tension between us
is affecting more than just us.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.966
Team, too.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.901
Yeah, and the team's
all that matters, right?

21:10.403 --> 21:11.738
I'm sorry.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.072
I-I didn't mean that.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.942
Wh-What I mean

21:15.975 --> 21:18.578
is I understand
why we decided

21:18.611 --> 21:21.748
not to be more than
just friends, but...

21:21.781 --> 21:25.585
I don't know how to go back
to being just friends.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.022
It's not easy.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.361
Well, it's not like
anything's changed, though.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.928
Has it? I mean,

21:35.962 --> 21:37.997
Country Mouse
and City Mouse...
(laughs)

21:38.030 --> 21:39.999
...all preceded that, too.

21:40.032 --> 21:43.870
Yeah, and it's also
what led to it, too.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.305
Or almost did, anyway.

21:47.940 --> 21:52.612
(sighs) Maybe it's time
to retire the mice.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.450
Percy.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.985
I don't believe it.
No, hey, I'm sorry.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.087
We just got to figure this out.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.723
Not us. That.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.093
LASALLE:
"Cornelius LaRue."

22:07.126 --> 22:09.862
A Confederate sailor.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.432
And why would
Jacob Anderson come here?

22:12.465 --> 22:15.134
Just to get pushed off the
same roof Cornelius did...

22:15.167 --> 22:18.037
150 years later.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.588
GREGORIO: Look, all I'm saying
is that coincidence

22:35.622 --> 22:36.923
is the least
likely explanation

22:36.956 --> 22:39.792
as to why Jacob Anderson
died the same way,

22:39.826 --> 22:42.395
and in the same place
as Cornelius LaRue did.

22:42.429 --> 22:45.164
Well, now that we know that
Jacob visited LaRue's crypt

22:45.197 --> 22:47.900
just before he was killed,

22:47.934 --> 22:50.937
I admit, there could
be a connection.
A crypt,

22:50.970 --> 22:52.872
which, by the way,
we now know is a stop

22:52.905 --> 22:54.774
on the Cornelius LaRue
Ghost Tour.

22:54.807 --> 22:55.975
Still doesn't mean the
connection we're looking for

22:56.008 --> 22:57.744
is supernatural.
Hey, Pride,

22:57.777 --> 22:59.546
if it walks like a ghost
and talks like a ghost, right?

22:59.579 --> 23:00.713
Gregorio.
Yes?

23:00.747 --> 23:01.981
All due respect...
Mm.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.450
...this is a hard
enough case to solve

23:03.483 --> 23:04.717
without wild theories.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.919
Besides, last I heard,

23:06.953 --> 23:08.788
courts require natural evidence

23:08.821 --> 23:10.690
to try the cases
that we bring them.
Okay.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.792
So let's just please focus on
what we know, all right?

23:12.825 --> 23:14.861
Well, unfortunately, we don't
know much other than Jacob

23:14.894 --> 23:16.963
was probably killed
investigating a family secret

23:16.996 --> 23:18.498
which somehow connects

23:18.531 --> 23:19.966
to Cornelius LaRue.
Agreed.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.734
Question is, what?

23:21.768 --> 23:23.570
Shouldn't have let Otis go,
could've asked him.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.539
I know, it's not
admissible in court.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.741
I get it.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.142
(eerie voice):
Boo...

23:32.779 --> 23:34.013
It's a little thematic humor,

23:34.046 --> 23:35.214
'cause of the whole, um...

23:35.247 --> 23:36.616
you know, the ghost thing.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.618
What do you got, Sebastian?

23:38.651 --> 23:39.986
SEBASTIAN:
Uh, I got test results

23:40.019 --> 23:41.588
from the bacteria that, uh,

23:41.621 --> 23:43.022
Loretta found
in the victim's lungs.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.757
Turns out that it's
a kind of mold,

23:44.791 --> 23:46.125
but not just any kind of mold.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.627
It's a very specific spore

23:47.660 --> 23:49.061
that hasn't been seen
or heard from

23:49.095 --> 23:50.563
since the 19th century.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.766
Any idea where Jacob
came in contact with it?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.735
No, but according to Loretta,
it must have been

23:55.768 --> 23:56.936
at one of his last stops.

23:56.969 --> 23:58.971
I just haven't had a chance
to figure out which one yet.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.072
GREGORIO:
Well, you know,

24:00.106 --> 24:03.075
Cornelius LaRue died
in the 19th century.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.512
Just trying to make

24:05.545 --> 24:07.647
a natural connection
here, so.
Mm.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.981
Continue.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.550
SEBASTIAN: Well, I mean,
you might have a point.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.085
Crypt, rooftop across
from the pharmacy,

24:13.119 --> 24:15.855
the 150-year-old mold spores--

24:15.888 --> 24:18.825
there's no denying that all
roads so far lead back to LaRue.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.528
Grandma Anderson's
family secret.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.997
It does look more and more like
Cornelius LaRue's death

24:25.031 --> 24:27.700
was what Jacob was investigating
before he got killed.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.836
SEBASTIAN: Well, if so, then he
must have found something

24:29.869 --> 24:30.970
that somebody didn't want found.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.972
Contact Chris and Sonja.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.875
Tell them to keep tracing
Jacob's last steps,

24:35.908 --> 24:38.878
but to be careful,
the killer is still out there.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.613
Sebastian,

24:40.647 --> 24:43.215
find out where exactly
Jacob inhaled those spores.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.618
Might just lead us to
what this case is all about.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.086
Where you going?

24:47.119 --> 24:49.622
Jacob's sister, see
if she knows anything

24:49.656 --> 24:51.624
about her brother investigating
Cornelius LaRue.

24:51.658 --> 24:52.825
Lasalle...

24:55.194 --> 24:57.964
We're at the next stop now,
Gregorio.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.299
We'll let you know.
(phone beeps)

25:00.332 --> 25:03.536
This case keeps getting nuttier
and nuttier all the time.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.838
Even King is starting to believe
in this crazy ghost story.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.206
It's hard not to.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.075
Pretty much every one
of Jacob's last stops

25:09.108 --> 25:10.810
matches up with
LaRue's Ghost Tour,

25:10.843 --> 25:12.311
including this one.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.180
The Edgar Mansion?
How so?
Mm-hmm.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.916
Apparently,
Cornelius LaRue's ghost

25:16.949 --> 25:19.218
has been spotted knocking
on the door over the years.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.588
(chuckles)
Well, if he was a ghost,

25:21.621 --> 25:23.322
why wouldn't he just
walk through the door?

25:23.355 --> 25:25.291
Good question.

25:29.696 --> 25:30.830
Hi.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.198
Are you one of the owners?

25:32.231 --> 25:33.933
Didn't you read the sign?
No trespassing.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.568
Ghost Tour stops
at the sidewalk.

25:35.602 --> 25:37.737
Hey, we're not part
of the Ghost Tour.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.838
Special Agent Percy,

25:38.871 --> 25:40.239
Lasalle, NCIS.

25:40.272 --> 25:42.341
We're here about a murder.
For God's sakes, we're already

25:42.374 --> 25:44.010
telling your other agent
everything we know.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.211
SONJA:
W-W-Wait.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.879
What other agent?

25:46.913 --> 25:48.815
Here he is.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.950
(scoffs)
Otis.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.319
What are you doing here?
What? Whoa. Okay.

25:53.352 --> 25:56.122
Wait. Before you get upset,

25:56.155 --> 25:58.157
in-in fairness,

25:58.190 --> 25:59.692
I only said I was helping

25:59.726 --> 26:01.293
NCIS. That's...

26:01.327 --> 26:03.596
Is there a problem?
And you are?

26:03.630 --> 26:05.698
Uh, Tate Prescott,
Tess's husband.

26:05.732 --> 26:06.933
OTIS: A-And someone
who's graciously

26:06.966 --> 26:08.835
taking time to help us

26:08.868 --> 26:10.302
figure out what Jacob

26:10.336 --> 26:11.337
was doing here yesterday.

26:11.370 --> 26:12.972
Us?
Yeah.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.206
Uh, come here.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.042
Sorry.
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.177
Have you lost your mind?

26:18.210 --> 26:19.946
LASALLE:
What are you doing here?
What's happening here?

26:19.979 --> 26:21.848
SONJA: Other than
impersonating a federal officer,

26:21.881 --> 26:23.750
which, by the way,
is not just a con,

26:23.783 --> 26:25.351
it's a felony.

26:25.384 --> 26:26.953
Listen,
I started thinking,

26:26.986 --> 26:28.320
it can't be a coincidence

26:28.354 --> 26:30.389
where and how Jacob died, right?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.391
So, I went on the Ghost Tour.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.993
Otis.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.228
Please, I can't just do nothing
anymore.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.997
I need to figure this out

26:38.030 --> 26:39.265
just as much as you do,
because

26:39.298 --> 26:40.232
i-if I don't,

26:40.266 --> 26:42.735
I'll never get them
out of my freakin' head.

26:42.769 --> 26:43.903
Enough. You're
under arrest.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.271
W-W-Wait. Just stop.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.306
You can't both talk
at the same time!

26:49.408 --> 26:51.410
I take it he's not
talking about you and me.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.412
(exhales)

26:53.445 --> 26:55.882
Okay, I'm listening.

26:55.915 --> 26:59.051
(eerie music plays)

27:00.787 --> 27:01.921
It's what?

27:03.455 --> 27:05.658
What? Where?

27:08.327 --> 27:10.429
It's, uh...

27:10.462 --> 27:12.098
Hmm.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.968
Uh... uh...

27:19.305 --> 27:20.673
There. That.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.742
What? May I?

27:22.775 --> 27:23.810
Of course.

27:23.843 --> 27:24.877
Recognize anybody?

27:24.911 --> 27:26.913
That's my great-great-
grandfather,

27:26.946 --> 27:28.447
Whitman Edgar, on the left.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.182
Uh-huh. Shaking hands

27:30.216 --> 27:33.686
with the one and only
Cornelius LaRue on the right.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.954
Whoa, wait.

27:34.987 --> 27:38.024
LaRue looks just like
Jacob Anderson.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.692
OTIS:
Right?

27:39.726 --> 27:42.695
Coincidence? I think not.

27:46.398 --> 27:49.301
PRIDE:
Your grandmother ever mention
the name Cornelius LaRue?

27:49.335 --> 27:52.404
I mean, other than as a part
of New Orleans lore?

27:52.438 --> 27:54.306
Not that I know of. Why?

27:54.340 --> 27:56.943
Well, I'm not sure,
Brandy, but it's possible

27:56.976 --> 27:58.711
she thought he was
somehow connected

27:58.745 --> 28:00.312
to some sort of
family secret.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.214
(laughs)
God love her,

28:02.248 --> 28:04.116
but Grams always loved
to spin her tales.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.052
She always thought the family
was more important

28:06.085 --> 28:09.355
to this town than people knew.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.891
What does this have to do
with what happened to Jacob?

28:11.924 --> 28:13.826
(sighs): I'm not sure
about that, either.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.128
But again, it's possible
that your brother thought

28:16.162 --> 28:17.897
there might have been
some truth

28:17.930 --> 28:20.232
to the family secret
and was looking for proof.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.001
And you think that
whoever killed him

28:22.034 --> 28:24.370
was looking for proof, too?
Maybe.

28:24.403 --> 28:27.473
Well, I don't think
there's anything in there

28:27.506 --> 28:28.808
that's gonna
help you much.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.477
It's just a bunch
of old journals

28:31.510 --> 28:33.846
and newspaper clippings
and old photos

28:33.880 --> 28:35.181
that Grams kept over the years.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.216
And you're sure
that this wasn't touched?

28:37.249 --> 28:38.951
I mean, by whoever broke in.

28:38.985 --> 28:41.453
No. It's always just
been buried beneath...

28:41.487 --> 28:43.522
PRIDE:
Huh.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.157
What is it?

28:45.191 --> 28:47.359
Newspaper clipping...

28:47.393 --> 28:49.996
about Cornelius LaRue's death.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.865
November 1, 1867,
right on top.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.867
Like she was just looking at it.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.803
Says LaRue jumped

28:56.836 --> 28:59.105
because of the
yellow fever,

28:59.138 --> 29:01.841
but the part that's underlined
says that his wife tried

29:01.874 --> 29:05.177
to get the police to open
a murder investigation.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.448
Why would Grams care
about any of that?

29:11.450 --> 29:14.220
Well, this might be why.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.289
Looks like she was putting
together a family tree

29:17.323 --> 29:19.391
going all the way back
to the Civil War.

29:19.425 --> 29:22.428
Seems your grandmother believed

29:22.461 --> 29:24.831
that someone changed
the family name

29:24.864 --> 29:27.233
after the Civil War...

29:27.266 --> 29:31.037
to Anderson, from LaRue.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.341
BRANDY:
Wait.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.311
We're related
to Cornelius LaRue?

29:39.345 --> 29:40.546
It might be the family secret

29:40.579 --> 29:42.214
she was trying
to piece together.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.553
SEBASTIAN:
If so,

29:47.586 --> 29:51.891
maybe Jacob was trying to prove
that LaRue was murdered, too?

29:51.924 --> 29:53.259
Although, I'm not quite sure
how he planned

29:53.292 --> 29:55.061
to do that 150 years later.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.896
Well, I don't know, somebody
obviously thought he could,

29:56.929 --> 29:59.331
otherwise, why would they be up
on that roof waiting for him?

29:59.365 --> 30:01.467
What end, though, you know?
I mean,

30:01.500 --> 30:03.535
LaRue's killer is long dead,
so what's the point?

30:03.569 --> 30:05.071
Oh.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.073
You know what we should do?
Get Otis,

30:07.106 --> 30:09.008
have him conjure
the ghost of LaRue,

30:09.041 --> 30:10.276
and then we can ask him.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.078
You know what?
Enough already.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.946
You don't want to believe
in this stuff? That's fine.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.582
That's your choice,
but stop teasing me.

30:16.615 --> 30:17.950
I'm not teasing you.
Yes, you are.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.018
I totally am teasing you.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.052
The point is,

30:20.086 --> 30:21.120
that I'm a scientist, okay?

30:21.153 --> 30:23.189
You got to show me proof
if you want me to believe

30:23.222 --> 30:24.423
that something exists.

30:24.456 --> 30:27.593
Can you prove that love exists?

30:30.262 --> 30:32.464
Hmm?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.934
No? Hmm?

30:34.967 --> 30:36.635
Hmm? No? Okay.
I rest my case.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.637
We're here.

30:38.670 --> 30:42.909
You think this is where Jacob
inhaled the old mold spores?

30:42.942 --> 30:46.045
SEBASTIAN:
The basement archive was his
last stop before he died.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.480
Basically the Four
Seasons Fungus down here.

30:57.556 --> 31:01.660
1860 to 1880.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.395
I bet you this is what
Jacob was looking for.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.564
Hurry up.
This place creeps me out.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.666
You know this is like a
total role reversal, right?

31:07.699 --> 31:09.135
I mean, usually
I'm the nervous one

31:09.168 --> 31:10.302
and you're cranky pants.
Just focus

31:10.336 --> 31:11.537
on the archives.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.572
All right. God.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.213
(whispering):
What was that?
What?

31:21.247 --> 31:22.414
Did you hear that?

31:22.448 --> 31:23.449
(gasps)
I'm not kidding.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.683
You wonder why
I tease you.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.618
Oh, crazy.

31:30.456 --> 31:31.623
What?

31:31.657 --> 31:33.559
There's something on
a-a Benjamin LaRue,

31:33.592 --> 31:35.194
he's Cornelius's son.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.196
It's a court approval
for a name change.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.464
Yeah, well, he didn't want
to be associated

31:38.497 --> 31:40.032
with a ghost; I don't blame him.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.167
Yeah, well, you're
never gonna guess

31:41.200 --> 31:42.234
what he changed
his name to.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.070
What?
Anderson.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.571
(scoffs)

31:45.604 --> 31:49.375
Grandma Anderson was right
about the family secret.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.111
But not why Cornelius and Jacob
were killed to protect it.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.048
Oh, God.
What was that?

31:56.082 --> 31:57.583
What was that, Sebastian?
I don't hear anything.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.051
Sebastian, shut up.
You're out of your mind.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.423
(Sebastian and Gregorio
shouting)

32:21.373 --> 32:23.442
(Gregorio coughs)
Hey, I still think
you should go to the ER.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.311
No, I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.
SONJA: Are you kidding me?

32:25.344 --> 32:26.445
The fire department is still
putting out the fire.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.580
You and Sebastian are lucky
you made it out at all.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.282
Just got a little scared is all.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.251
Par for the course
on this case.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.020
You sure you're all right?
I will be,

32:34.053 --> 32:35.687
once we find out who tried
to make us ghosts.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.057
I mean, we're obviously not
the only ones following

32:38.090 --> 32:40.392
in Jacob's last steps.
SONJA: And whoever it
is doesn't want us

32:40.426 --> 32:41.560
finding out what they found,
either.

32:41.593 --> 32:44.496
Looks like they left tire
tracks at the scene, though.

32:44.530 --> 32:45.998
Sebastian's
cross-checking 'em to see

32:46.032 --> 32:47.499
if he can get a car match.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.135
Well, that's about
our only hope.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.003
No surveillance cameras
in the area.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.404
Well, somebody's going
to an awful lot of trouble

32:52.438 --> 32:54.406
to keep the truth from us.
But why?

32:54.440 --> 32:57.109
Can't just be to solve
a 150-year-old murder.
Well, means it's got

32:57.143 --> 32:59.111
to be connected to the fact
that the Andersons

32:59.145 --> 33:01.380
are related to Cornelius LaRue.

33:01.413 --> 33:02.248
Again though, why?

33:02.281 --> 33:03.682
What's to gain
and what's the motive?

33:03.715 --> 33:05.017
What do we know

33:05.051 --> 33:06.318
about Cornelius LaRue,

33:06.352 --> 33:08.587
other than he was
a Confederate sailor?

33:08.620 --> 33:11.290
Born in New Orleans
to a family of doctors,

33:11.323 --> 33:15.561
attended Harvard Medical School
before returning home to enlist.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.563
PRIDE:
Medical school.

33:17.596 --> 33:21.300
You got that picture
of LaRue and Edgar?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.035
Thank you.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.304
LASALLE:
What is it, King?

33:25.337 --> 33:28.574
Whitman Edgar was the founder
of the first pharmacy

33:28.607 --> 33:30.176
in the States,
right here in New Orleans,

33:30.209 --> 33:32.178
if I remember correctly.
Yeah, the museum.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.546
Which the family then turned
into one of the largest chains

33:34.580 --> 33:37.616
in the country.
I don't know why I didn't
notice this before,

33:37.649 --> 33:39.585
but this photo was taken
right in front,

33:39.618 --> 33:41.153
across from our crime scene.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.555
Businessman and doctor,
shaking hands.

33:43.589 --> 33:44.656
Almost like partners.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.158
SONJA:
Wait, are you suggesting

33:46.192 --> 33:47.826
Cornelius LaRue
and Whitman Edgar

33:47.859 --> 33:49.561
started the pharmacy together?

33:49.595 --> 33:51.797
Definitely not what
the Edgar family lore says.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.599
Might be they don't want
anybody finding out.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.102
Company like that's got to be
worth hundreds of millions.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.337
Half of which would belong to
the Andersons, if it was true.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.606
Sounds like a motive
to push Cornelius off the roof.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.274
And Jacob.
Yeah, but...

34:02.308 --> 34:03.775
how do we prove it?

34:03.809 --> 34:05.777
Maybe with a certain
Mercedes G-Class.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.780
Those tire tracks we found
at the library, pretty unique.

34:08.814 --> 34:10.382
Also expensive.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.650
LASALLE:
Edgar Mansion had

34:11.683 --> 34:13.185
a G-Wagen parked out front.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.753
SONYA: He's right.
We saw it there.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.489
All right, Gregorio, Sebastian,
let's go pay them a visit.

34:17.523 --> 34:21.327
Chris, Sonya,
we need proof of the partnership

34:21.360 --> 34:22.828
if we're gonna make
any of this stuff stick.

34:22.861 --> 34:26.098
All right, Pharmacy Museum
will be the place to find it.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.666
We're on it.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.302
(sighs)

34:40.479 --> 34:42.714
Thought we were gonna wait
for the curator.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.383
No time.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.318
Folks trying to kill
Gregorio and Sebastian means

34:46.352 --> 34:49.388
we're getting close.
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

34:49.421 --> 34:52.358
LASALLE: Museum's a window
to the pharmacy's beginnings.

34:52.391 --> 34:53.792
We're looking for anything
to connect the dots

34:53.825 --> 34:55.494
to its founders.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.130
Yeah, but that's
still pretty much a long shot.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.366
I mean, the Edgar family

35:00.399 --> 35:02.334
would've removed
all the evidence by now.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.403
Yeah, except they didn't know
anyone was looking

35:04.436 --> 35:06.472
until Jacob
started sniffing around.

35:06.505 --> 35:07.873
Maybe they didn't
have time.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.541
SONJA:
Wait.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.410
There's that same photo.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.279
All right. What about it?

35:13.312 --> 35:16.748
I never noticed it
before, but the angle.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.285
Like... it was taken
from high up,

35:19.318 --> 35:20.719
like from across the street.

35:22.554 --> 35:23.555
LASALLE:
From the rooftop.

35:23.589 --> 35:24.556
Maybe that's why

35:24.590 --> 35:26.258
Jacob went up there,

35:26.292 --> 35:28.427
thinking he might find
something.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.762
Like maybe...

35:30.796 --> 35:33.332
proof?

35:34.800 --> 35:37.236
I don't even know what you're
talking about. I was at home

35:37.269 --> 35:38.704
all night, in bed.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.572
And I don't appreciate
the implication that I was...

35:40.606 --> 35:43.775
If you don't have somebody who
can back up your alibi, ma'am,

35:43.809 --> 35:45.511
it'll be more than
just an implication.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.313
It'll be
probable cause.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.248
We think your Mercedes
was parked

35:49.281 --> 35:51.450
near the scene of an
attempted murder today.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.584
Of me.

35:52.618 --> 35:54.586
So either you hand over
the car keys

35:54.620 --> 35:55.854
or you're under arrest.

35:55.887 --> 35:56.855
All right.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.890
I have nothing to hide.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.494
The car's gone.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.896
It's not in the garage
or on the side street.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.769
Where's your husband?

36:23.315 --> 36:25.351
(gun cocks)
Your gun,

36:25.384 --> 36:28.387
slide it
over to me slowly.

36:52.043 --> 36:52.978
You, uh...

36:53.011 --> 36:55.414
you've been pretty busy tonight,
haven't you?

36:55.447 --> 36:56.882
Following us all over town.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.950
Well, I had to figure out
what Jacob was looking for,

36:58.984 --> 37:00.619
what he had.
Because he told you

37:00.652 --> 37:03.889
the family you married into
stole the company from his.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.757
And when you couldn't find
the proof at his house,

37:05.791 --> 37:07.359
you followed him here.

37:07.393 --> 37:10.296
Killed him before he had
a chance to expose the truth.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.564
I wasn't sure
what he had, exactly.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.032
I still don't.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.502
But he obviously knew
that he had something.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.604
LASALLE:
Percy!

37:18.637 --> 37:20.806
What are you doing?

37:23.875 --> 37:26.445
So, what are
you gonna do?

37:26.478 --> 37:28.580
You can't push me off the roof
like you did Jacob.

37:28.614 --> 37:29.848
I'm not alone here.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.750
Percy, come on, already.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.386
Do you see anything

37:34.420 --> 37:35.554
or don't you?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.289
Tell him there's nothing here

37:37.323 --> 37:38.590
and you're coming down.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.593
Now.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.536
Nothing's here,

37:50.569 --> 37:52.838
City Mouse!

37:56.107 --> 37:57.576
So, now what?

37:57.609 --> 37:59.578
The secret's out, Tate.

37:59.611 --> 38:03.549
We won't be the last agents to
figure out what really happened.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.417
Yeah, maybe.

38:05.451 --> 38:06.985
But maybe not.

38:07.018 --> 38:10.722
Absent proof,
it's just another ghost story.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.659
And you'll just add to it.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.960
Don't do it!

38:15.861 --> 38:17.729
(grunting)

38:20.098 --> 38:21.833
(Tate shouts)

38:21.867 --> 38:23.835
(grunting)

38:23.869 --> 38:25.404
Here!

38:25.437 --> 38:26.738
Give me your hand!

38:30.476 --> 38:31.843
SONJA: Come on!
Take his hand!

38:31.877 --> 38:33.579
It's not worth it!

38:33.612 --> 38:35.614
(panting)

38:35.647 --> 38:38.350
You're right.

38:38.384 --> 38:39.851
(yelling)

38:41.587 --> 38:42.588
(body thuds)

38:54.966 --> 38:57.503
*

38:59.671 --> 39:02.007
(siren wailing in distance)

39:05.611 --> 39:06.912
(horn honks)

39:06.945 --> 39:08.914
(indistinct chatter)

39:08.947 --> 39:11.517
(horn honking)

39:11.550 --> 39:13.652
(siren wailing)

39:17.723 --> 39:19.691
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

39:19.725 --> 39:22.561
Should've seen that Jacob was
up there looking on the mosaic.

39:22.594 --> 39:25.731
Figured out what
Tate never did:

39:25.764 --> 39:26.932
proof was there
all along.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.166
Yeah, well, luckily,

39:28.199 --> 39:29.968
you were too busy
saving my butt.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.671
Country Mouse.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.674
I thought you wanted
to retire the mice.

39:35.707 --> 39:39.377
That was before
they saved my life.

39:43.114 --> 39:45.684
PRIDE: Think I might've
found something.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.654
(grunts)

39:50.789 --> 39:52.090
Looks like a time capsule.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.158
Ma'am.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.096
She's all right.

39:58.129 --> 40:00.932
They used to be fairly
common in New Orleans,

40:00.966 --> 40:02.801
used to mark
the opening of things,

40:02.834 --> 40:05.904
especially new businesses.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.474
Anderson must've figured it out.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.176
A newspaper clipping from
the opening of the pharmacy.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.879
Old photos.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.118
Contract.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.220
"With this
indenture, I,

40:22.253 --> 40:23.922
"Merchant Whitman Edgar,

40:23.955 --> 40:25.624
"and I, Physician
Cornelius LaRue

40:25.657 --> 40:29.227
"pledge to found and uphold
this business

40:29.260 --> 40:31.730
"in mutual partnership.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.965
"Shall it heal the
city for generations

40:33.999 --> 40:36.835
to come."
And it is signed by both men.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.704
LASALLE:
It's too bad it didn't

40:38.737 --> 40:39.971
work out that way.

40:41.573 --> 40:44.109
I-I had no idea.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.612
Past is what it is.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.617
Just have to find a way
to move forward.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.893
(knocking on door)

41:11.102 --> 41:13.171
I'm Tessa Edgar.

41:16.608 --> 41:19.010
Can we talk?

41:31.289 --> 41:33.792
*

41:39.330 --> 41:41.032
(quietly):
Hey.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.934
Hey.
Hey. Whoa. Okay.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.804
Whoa. I-I was
totally exonerated.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.305
No, I'm not here as a cop.
Matter of fact,

41:47.338 --> 41:49.875
if anybody asks,
I'm not here at all.

41:50.942 --> 41:51.910
Okay.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.680
So...

41:54.713 --> 41:56.648
So, what? What do you want?

41:56.682 --> 41:58.784
Let's just say, uh...

41:58.817 --> 42:00.686
my father's driving me nuts.

42:00.719 --> 42:02.721
Wouldn't mind taking care of it
once and for all,

42:02.754 --> 42:03.955
if you know what I'm saying.

42:03.989 --> 42:05.190
Nah...

42:05.223 --> 42:07.192
He's dead.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.927
I need to
talk to him.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.662
Oh. Right.

42:10.696 --> 42:11.697
Yeah.
Sorry.

42:11.730 --> 42:12.598
It's okay.
Have, um...

42:12.631 --> 42:13.799
have a seat.

42:13.832 --> 42:15.200
No, I can't sit.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.969
I got a reputation to keep,
you know what I'm saying?

42:18.970 --> 42:20.606
Follow me.
