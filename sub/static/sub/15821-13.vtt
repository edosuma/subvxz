WEBVTT

00:04.181 --> 00:05.049
FRITZY!

00:05.872 --> 00:07.085
THE MOVIE'S READY,
AND I GOT DINNER

00:07.085 --> 00:08.661
SET UP ON
THE COFFEE TABLE.

00:08.989 --> 00:11.068
Fritz: I'M COMING.
OH...

00:14.601 --> 00:15.599
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:20.276 --> 00:21.401
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:21.401 --> 00:23.415
YOU LEFT THE PATIO
DOOR OPEN,

00:23.415 --> 00:25.543
WHICH I HAVE TOLD YOU
ONE BILLION TIMES
NOT TO DO.

00:25.543 --> 00:27.539
WHERE'S KITTY?
KITTY?

00:27.877 --> 00:29.269
HERE, KITTY, KITTY
KITTY, KITTY.

00:29.269 --> 00:30.309
KITTY?

00:30.309 --> 00:31.740
KITTY, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:31.740 --> 00:34.457
KITTY?

00:34.769 --> 00:36.631
PSST, PSST.
KITTY.

00:37.197 --> 00:38.128
TO EAT.

00:38.210 --> 00:39.308
TO EAT.

00:39.686 --> 00:41.134
LET'S TO EAT, KITTY.

00:42.395 --> 00:46.977
KITTY?

00:46.977 --> 00:48.552
PSST, PSST, PSST,
KITTY.

00:49.315 --> 00:50.281
TO EAT.

00:50.753 --> 00:52.340
TO EAT, OH...

00:52.340 --> 00:57.400
KITTY, KITTY, KITTY.

00:59.037 --> 01:00.943
TO EAT?

01:00.943 --> 01:02.250
SHE'S NOT
IN THE BACK.

01:05.179 --> 01:09.950
KITTY, KITTY, KITTY
KITTY, KITTY...

01:09.950 --> 01:11.011
WE'LL WALK THE BLOCK.

01:11.011 --> 01:13.826
POOR KITTY.
HE'S PROBABLY
TERRIFIED.

01:13.826 --> 01:15.483
SHE--SHE'S PROBABLY
TERRIFIED.

01:15.483 --> 01:18.033
AND WHILE WE'RE OUT,
WE'LL LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN

01:18.033 --> 01:20.132
AND WE'LL PUT
SOME FOOD OUT FOR HER.

01:20.132 --> 01:20.800
KITTY!

01:20.800 --> 01:23.618
OH! KITTY?

01:23.618 --> 01:26.982
KITTY? FRITZ, I TOLD YOU
NOT TO LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN!

01:26.982 --> 01:29.525
OH, KITTY.
COME BACK HERE
THIS INSTANT!

01:29.525 --> 01:33.216
KITTY!
KITTY, KITTY, KITTY
KITTY, KITTY...

01:39.216 --> 01:40.255
HELLO.

01:41.263 --> 01:42.462
HEY, JERRY, WHAT'S UP?

01:43.661 --> 01:44.758
WHAT?

01:45.568 --> 01:46.409
OH, NO.

01:47.426 --> 01:48.436
NO, NOT YET.
WHY?

01:48.437 --> 01:50.249
-KITTY!
-YEAH, OK.

01:50.249 --> 01:51.314
YEAH. I CAN WORK
THIS CASE FOR YOU.

01:53.561 --> 01:54.499
[SIGHING]
OH, I SEE.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.215
HE'S THERE
ALREADY?

01:58.022 --> 01:59.091
NO, NO, NO.
PUT HIM ON.

01:59.531 --> 02:01.238
SOMEBODY'S
TRIED TO MURDER
A PROTECTED WITNESS

02:01.238 --> 02:02.689
AT ONE OF OUR
SAFE HOUSES HERE IN L.A.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.287
KILLED THE GUY'S WIFE
AND AN FBI AGENT INSTEAD.

02:05.287 --> 02:07.165
GABRIEL IS THERE,
AND HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

02:07.679 --> 02:08.806
GOOD EVENING,
SERGEANT GABRIEL.

02:12.685 --> 02:14.001
ALL RIGHT, WHERE DO
YOU NEED ME TO BE?

02:14.001 --> 02:23.010
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

02:23.011 --> 02:32.087
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM@°²ÄÈ¸â&Linda</font>

02:32.088 --> 02:36.040
YOU HAVE A SAFE HOUSE
NEXT TO A RACE TRA?

02:36.040 --> 02:38.818
IT'S NOT MINE.
IT'S THE FBI's.
HEH!

02:39.786 --> 02:41.915
JUST LET ME GET
TIM HECHT AND I'LL FIND
YOU IN A MINUTE.

02:43.912 --> 02:45.607
SO, SERGEANT,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

02:45.607 --> 02:46.670
A BIG MESS.

02:46.670 --> 02:47.963
POSSIBLY A SHOOTOUT.

02:47.963 --> 02:50.615
WE'VE BLOCKED OFF THE CRIME
SCENE AND SET UP OUR EQUIPMENT.

02:50.615 --> 02:52.906
BUT THE FBI INVESTIGATES
THE DEATH OF FEDERAL AGENTS,

02:52.906 --> 02:55.572
AND THEY AGGRESSIVELY
DO NOT WANT ANY MORE
OF OUR HELP.

02:56.136 --> 02:58.916
THEY ACTUALLY DROVE
THROUGH OUR CRIME SCENE TAPE
AND PUT UP THEIR OWN.

02:58.916 --> 03:00.030
Daniels:
FANCY, ISN'T IT?

03:00.030 --> 03:01.681
SO WE'RE ALL
GLOVED UP AND
NO PLACE TO GO.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.954
ISN'T ONE OF
THE VICTIMS THE WIFE
OF A PROTECTED WITNESS?

03:04.954 --> 03:07.370
YES, MA'AM, AND I
THOUGHT THAT MADE IT
PARTLY OUR CASE

03:07.370 --> 03:08.279
BUT APPARENTLY...

03:08.279 --> 03:10.846
THE PROTECTED WITNESS
IS SITTING OVER THERE
IN THE GARAGE.

03:10.846 --> 03:12.404
SOME OLD MAFIA GUY.

03:12.851 --> 03:15.249
HE WAS IN THE BACK
OF THE SUV.
SAW THE WHOLE THING.

03:15.888 --> 03:18.848
I'M GUESSING WE HAVE
A LITTLE JURISDICTIONAL
PROBLEM.

03:18.848 --> 03:20.606
NO. WE DON'T.

03:21.842 --> 03:23.665
[SOUTHERN DRAWL]
MISS SCARLETT
TO THE RESCUE.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.372
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM?

03:29.574 --> 03:31.055
DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON,
LAPD.

03:31.055 --> 03:33.360
MA'AM, EXCUSE ME,
PLEASE. PLEASE STOP!

03:36.420 --> 03:38.407
YOU'RE INTERFERING
WITH A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION.

03:38.720 --> 03:39.809
I AM?

03:39.809 --> 03:42.005
OH, EXCUSE ME.
ONE SECOND.

03:42.370 --> 03:44.331
LIEUTENANT TAO
WOULD YOU PLEASE
HAVE S.I.D.

03:44.331 --> 03:46.997
SHUT DOWN OUR
WORK LIGHTS, PLEASE?

03:48.698 --> 03:49.669
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

03:49.669 --> 03:52.473
WE NEED THE LIGHTS ON
SO THAT WE CAN DO OUR WORK,
ALL RIGHT?

03:54.993 --> 03:56.520
HEY! HEY! HOLD ON!

03:57.319 --> 03:58.969
YOU'LL BE NEEDING
THIS, I BELIEVE.

03:58.969 --> 04:03.463
SPECIAL AGENT TIM HECHT,
MEET DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA JOHNSON.

04:04.214 --> 04:05.676
CHARMED, I'M SURE.

04:11.073 --> 04:14.890
Hecht: THAT'S
AGENT DOHERTY IN
THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

04:14.890 --> 04:17.134
HE WAS BABY-SITTING
MY PROTECTED WITNESS
MARTIN DELUCA.

04:17.896 --> 04:20.519
THAT'S DELUCA'S WIFE,
MICHELLE.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.120
HER HUSBAND WAS
SEATED BEHIND HER.

04:22.801 --> 04:23.531
WHERE WERE THEY GOING?

04:24.590 --> 04:26.275
IT WAS THEIR THIRD
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

04:26.275 --> 04:28.276
WE'D ARRANGED A DINNER
AT A NEARBY RESTAURANT.

04:30.850 --> 04:32.453
IT WASN'T JUST BUSINESS
WITH THE DELUCAS.

04:32.453 --> 04:33.374
THEY WERE MORE
LIKE FAMILY.

04:36.197 --> 04:38.573
I'M SO SORRY,
AGENT HECHT.

04:38.573 --> 04:40.343
I SUPPOSE THAT'S
PARTLY WHY YOU ARRIVED

04:40.343 --> 04:41.287
AT THE CRIME SCENE
SO QUICKLY.

04:44.898 --> 04:48.516
MARTY TELEPHONED ME.
I TOLD HIM TO CALL 911

04:48.516 --> 04:50.824
AND TO SIT STILL
UNTIL YOUR PEOPLE
COULD GET HERE.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.933
DOES THIS SAFE HOUSE
COME EQUIPPED WITH
A MONITORING SYSTEM?

04:54.451 --> 04:56.267
YES. APPARENTLY,
IT WAS DISABLED.

04:56.748 --> 04:57.725
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

04:58.139 --> 04:59.010
WE'RE LOOKING
INTO IT.

04:59.304 --> 05:01.651
SO YOU SAID THAT
AGENT DOHERTY WAS
BABY-SITTING THE DELUCAS.

05:01.651 --> 05:02.103
WHERE WERE YOU?

05:02.103 --> 05:04.107
I HAD AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE U.S.
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

05:04.107 --> 05:05.588
ABOUT THE UPCOMING
TRIAL.

05:05.588 --> 05:07.726
THIS AMBUSH WOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED
ON MY WATCH.

05:08.410 --> 05:09.490
MARTIN'S HERE
TO TESTIFY?

05:09.951 --> 05:10.846
IN 48 HOURS.

05:10.846 --> 05:13.040
HE'S TESTIFYING AGAINST
JOSEPH DELLAMONTE.

05:13.474 --> 05:14.588
HE'S A BIG-TIME
MOB BOSS.

05:14.588 --> 05:17.087
SHE KNOWS WHO
THE DELLAMONTE CRIME
FAMILY IS, TIM.

05:17.711 --> 05:19.862
MARTY DELUCA WORKED FOR
JOSEPH DELLAMONTE'S FATHER.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.349
WELL, FIRST THING'S FIRST.

05:21.349 --> 05:23.339
WE NEED TO GET
MR. DELUCA
TRANSFERRED TO OUR--

05:23.339 --> 05:24.391
HOLD IT.
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.

05:24.391 --> 05:25.815
YOU'RE NOT
TAKING HIM ANYWHERE.

05:25.815 --> 05:27.479
HE IS IN FEDERAL
CUSTODY.

05:27.479 --> 05:28.269
I NEED TO QUESTION HIM.

05:28.335 --> 05:30.061
EXCUSE ME.
WAIT A MINUTE.

05:30.061 --> 05:32.474
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR DELUCA'S SAFETY.

05:32.474 --> 05:33.643
YOU'RE DOING
A BANG-UP JOB.

05:34.843 --> 05:37.116
CHIEF POPE, A FEDERAL
AGENT IS DOWN.

05:37.116 --> 05:38.822
THAT MAKES THIS
CRIME SCENE OURS.

05:38.822 --> 05:40.718
IS MR. DELUCA'S WIFE
A FEDERAL AGENT, TOO?

05:41.082 --> 05:42.868
NO. LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,

05:42.868 --> 05:44.148
IF YOU'D TAKE CHARGE
OF THE WITNESS, PLEASE?

05:44.148 --> 05:44.872
SIR.

05:44.872 --> 05:47.048
SPECIAL AGENT HOWARD
AND AGENT HECHT, RIGHT?

05:47.048 --> 05:49.281
MY OFFICE IN TWO HOURS
AFTER CHIEF JOHNSON
HAS A CHANCE

05:49.281 --> 05:50.206
TO INTERVIEW DELUCA.

05:50.206 --> 05:51.489
WILL, I CAN'T
AGREE TO THIS.

05:51.489 --> 05:52.406
IF YOU DON'T AGREE,
DON'T COME.

05:52.406 --> 05:53.825
THAT SOUND FAIR
TO EVERYBODY? GOOD.

05:55.972 --> 05:56.614
PARDON ME.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.035
Flynn: LET'S GO.

06:08.378 --> 06:09.986
YOU NEVER MURDER
YOUR OWN BLOOD.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.181
YOU NEVER KILL
A GUY'S FAMILY.

06:12.863 --> 06:15.558
YOU NEVER TAKE OUT
A FEDERAL AGENT--NEVER.

06:15.558 --> 06:18.707
THIS NEW DELLAMONTE
GENERATION--THEY'RE
LIKE TERRORISTS.

06:18.707 --> 06:19.444
SCUM.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.040
CAN YOU WALK ME
THROUGH EXACTLY

06:22.040 --> 06:23.518
WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE THE SHOOTING?

06:25.481 --> 06:28.595
UM, MICHELLE AND I...
THAT'S MY WIFE...

06:29.700 --> 06:30.636
WE GOT READY FOR DINNER.

06:31.904 --> 06:32.927
AGENT DOHERTY
WAS DRIVING.

06:33.791 --> 06:34.463
NICE KID.

06:35.413 --> 06:36.474
VERY RESPECTFUL.

06:37.045 --> 06:38.649
WE ENTERED THE GARAGE
THROUGH THE KITCHEN,

06:39.590 --> 06:41.269
GOT INTO THE SUV,

06:41.269 --> 06:43.430
AND I USUALLY
SAT UP FRONT

06:44.651 --> 06:46.841
BUT MICHELLE'S STOMACH
HASN'T BEEN RIGHT

06:46.841 --> 06:50.647
SINCE SHE LOST OUR BABY
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

06:51.817 --> 06:54.595
SO, ANYWAY, I...
I HAD HER TAKE...

06:56.544 --> 07:00.136
OHH...EXCUSE ME.

07:04.303 --> 07:07.451
I HAD HER
TAKE MY SEAT.

07:11.956 --> 07:12.831
AND THEN?

07:17.817 --> 07:20.257
AGENT DOHERTY
OPENED THE GARAGE,

07:20.257 --> 07:22.892
AND AS WE STARTED
TO BACK OUT,

07:22.892 --> 07:24.950
SOME GUY STEPPED OUT
IN FRONT OF US

07:24.950 --> 07:26.504
AND STARTED FIRING.

07:26.504 --> 07:30.500
SO, I GUESS, DOHERTY'S
FOOT HIT THE GAS PEDAL

07:30.500 --> 07:32.533
AND WE BACKED DOWN
THE DRIVEWAY AND HIT A TREE.

07:32.533 --> 07:33.730
AND HE WAS DEAD.

07:33.730 --> 07:34.737
SO I GRABBED HIS GUN.

07:34.737 --> 07:36.376
AND AS THE KILLER
CAME TOWARD ME,

07:36.376 --> 07:38.282
I FIRED AT HIM
AND HE RAN OFF.

07:39.870 --> 07:43.126
THEN I HEARD HIS CAR
START AND DRIVE AWAY

07:43.126 --> 07:45.888
AS I TRIED TO GET
TO MY WIFE.

07:48.952 --> 07:50.160
DID YOU SEE
HIS FACE?

07:52.653 --> 07:53.483
YEAH.

07:55.230 --> 07:56.555
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM,
THOUGH.

07:57.444 --> 08:01.531
THIS JOEY DELLAMONTE'S
GOT ALL THESE NEW PEOPLE
SURROUNDING HIM NOW.

08:02.606 --> 08:04.670
BUT THE SHOOTER STEPPED
INTO THE HEADLIGHT

08:05.527 --> 08:07.015
RIGHT BEFORE
HE OPENED UP ON US.

08:07.756 --> 08:08.844
AND I SAW HIM.

08:10.584 --> 08:12.495
I CALLED, "WATCH OUT!"
TO MY WIFE.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.030
BUT THERE WAS NO PLACE
FOR MICHELLE TO GO.

08:21.860 --> 08:22.942
I DUCKED...

08:24.615 --> 08:25.760
AND SHE DIED.

08:33.087 --> 08:35.166
ANYBODY ELSE
WOULD'VE DONE
THE SAME THING.

08:37.929 --> 08:40.030
CHIEF, WE'VE GOT HIM
LOOKING THROUGH PHOTOS

08:40.030 --> 08:42.293
OF KNOWN ASSOCIATES OF
THE DELLAMONTE FAMILY.

08:42.293 --> 08:44.411
AS SOON AS SOMEONE
POPS OUT AT HIM,

08:44.411 --> 08:46.305
WE'LL HAVE GABRIEL
START LOOKING.

08:52.325 --> 08:53.077
PARDON ME.

08:58.512 --> 09:00.688
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR.

09:05.099 --> 09:06.802
Taylor: AGENT HECHT
HAS ALL THE CASINGS,

09:06.802 --> 09:10.282
BULLETS, AND THE MURDER
WEAPON COLLECTED FROM
THE CRIME SCENE,

09:10.282 --> 09:11.881
AND HE'S REFUSING
TO SHARE.

09:11.881 --> 09:13.423
I TOLD YOU ALREADY,
COMMANDER, YOU CAN HAVE

09:13.423 --> 09:16.292
ACCESS TO ALL THE EVIDENCE
YOU WANT WHEN YOU RETURN
DELUCA TO ME.

09:16.718 --> 09:20.131
OK. LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT
EXACTLY HOW WE MIGHT RUN

09:20.131 --> 09:21.559
THIS JOINT
INVESTIGATION.

09:21.559 --> 09:23.561
WH--THERE IS
NO JOINT INVESTIGATION.

09:24.029 --> 09:26.320
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE
TO RETURN DELUCA
TO AGENT HECHT.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.776
I'M SORRY.
DELUCA STAYS HERE.

09:28.146 --> 09:30.334
WHAT? WHERE DO YOU
GET THE AUTHORITY
TO HOLD HIM?

09:30.995 --> 09:33.898
HE'S IN MY BUILDING
SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS
OF POLICE OFFICERS.

09:33.898 --> 09:35.488
I THINK THAT'S ALL
THE AUTHORITY I NEED.

09:35.488 --> 09:36.672
THAT'S EXTORTION.

09:37.562 --> 09:38.937
YEAH. TAKE A MINUTE
AND GET OVER IT.

09:38.937 --> 09:41.943
CHIEF JOHNSON,
IF SPECIAL AGENT HOWARD
ULTIMATELY AGREES

09:41.943 --> 09:45.512
TO A JOINT INVESTIGATION,
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT
TO HOW WE MIGHT PROCEED?

09:45.859 --> 09:47.678
UH, WELL, FIRST,
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

09:47.678 --> 09:49.935
HOW THE MURDERER
COULD HAVE KNOWN OF
MR. DELUCA'S WHEREABOUTS.

09:50.002 --> 09:53.353
SO I NEED THE FBI TO OBTAIN
PHONE AND EMAIL RECORDS

09:53.353 --> 09:55.672
OF EVERYONE WITH
ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION.

09:55.672 --> 09:57.439
THEN I'D LIKE TO QUESTION
JOSEPH DELLAMONTE

09:57.505 --> 09:58.939
WHO'S CURRENTLY
IN FEDERAL DETENTION.

10:00.364 --> 10:01.665
AND I'D LIKE
LIEUTENANT TAO

10:01.666 --> 10:04.122
TO EXAMINE THE BULLETS,
CASINGS, AND WEAPONS INVOLVED.

10:05.346 --> 10:08.893
OH! AND A LIST OF EVERYONE
AGAINST WHOM MR. DELUCA
AGREED TO TESTIFY.

10:08.893 --> 10:09.790
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

10:10.846 --> 10:11.572
YOU'RE KIDDING.

10:11.572 --> 10:13.056
SHE'S NOT,
ACTUALLY.

10:14.009 --> 10:16.973
AND IN RETURN,
WE WILL SHARE CUSTODY
OF DELUCA WITH AGENT HECHT,

10:16.973 --> 10:20.566
WHO MAY STAY WITH HIM
AT AN LAPD SAFE HOUSE,

10:20.566 --> 10:23.200
WHICH WILL BE
THE CHEAPEST TWO-BEDROOM

10:23.200 --> 10:25.191
HOTEL SUITE WE CAN FIND
ON SHORT NOTICE.

10:25.983 --> 10:28.668
WITH FLYNN
AND PROVENZA.

10:29.335 --> 10:31.772
WANT TO MAKE AGENT HECHT
AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE.

10:33.409 --> 10:35.735
Hecht: 10 YEARS
OF RESEARCH,

10:35.735 --> 10:38.096
4 YEARS OF ACTIVE
SURVEILLANCE,

10:38.096 --> 10:40.823
TWO YEARS OF TRIAL
PREPARATION,

10:40.823 --> 10:43.422
TRYING TO BRING
THE DELLAMONTE FAMILY
TO JUSTICE.

10:43.422 --> 10:46.831
AND IN TWO DAYS,
MARTIN DELUCA IS
REQUIRED BY LAW

10:46.831 --> 10:49.560
TO STEP INTO
A COURTROOM, RAISE
HIS RIGHT HAND,

10:49.560 --> 10:53.152
AND TELL THE TRUTH
ABOUT JOSEPH DELLAMONTE!

10:54.110 --> 10:57.371
AND CUSTODY OF
HIS PERSON WILL
RETURN TO ME!

10:58.423 --> 11:00.677
AND IF YOU DO ANYTHING
TO INTERFERE WITH THAT,

11:01.759 --> 11:03.508
AND I MEAN ANYTHING...

11:05.000 --> 11:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:21.365 --> 11:24.216
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO ACCOMPLISH IN THAT
AMOUNT OF TIME?

11:24.720 --> 11:27.829
SOLVE THE CASE.
PLEASE.

11:31.426 --> 11:33.850
YES, MAMA, I KNOW
SOME PEOPLE TAKE PICTURES

11:33.850 --> 11:36.154
OF THEIR PETS,
BUT I DID NOT.

11:36.818 --> 11:39.011
NO. OF COURSE, KITTY
DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

11:39.011 --> 11:40.423
I TAKE VERY GOOD
CARE OF HIM.

11:40.423 --> 11:42.702
HER. HER!
YOU TAKE GOOD CARE
OF HER.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.780
FRITZ LEFT
THE DOOR OPEN.

11:45.088 --> 11:46.750
GIVE ME THE PHONE!

11:46.751 --> 11:49.822
WELL, HE'S NOT USED
TO HAVING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR A PET.

11:50.331 --> 11:52.914
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE DRIVING ME
CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

11:53.314 --> 11:54.471
ACROSS THE BOARD.

11:55.039 --> 11:58.080
MAMA, DID YOU TAKE
A PICTURE OF THE CAT
OR NOT?

11:59.460 --> 12:01.608
OK, GOOD.
I'D APPRECIATE THAT.

12:01.609 --> 12:03.601
NO, NO, NO.
HAVE JIM EMAIL IT
TO ME AT HOME.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.765
OK. YOU'LL BE
THE FIRST TO KNOW.

12:07.657 --> 12:08.533
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

12:09.084 --> 12:10.112
BYE.

12:14.533 --> 12:16.176
Gabriel: SO, HERE'S
THE GUY DELUCA THINKS

12:16.176 --> 12:18.457
MIGHT BE THE SHOOTER--
TOM CALI.

12:19.301 --> 12:20.176
HERE'S HIS FILE.

12:20.535 --> 12:23.501
TOM CALI'S
A SOLDIER/ENFORCER
FOR DELLAMONTE.

12:23.501 --> 12:25.013
HE'S GOT ARRESTS
GOING BACK 10 YEARS

12:25.013 --> 12:26.215
FOR ASSAULT AND FRAUD.

12:26.619 --> 12:27.717
LAST MONTH HE VANISHED.

12:27.717 --> 12:29.636
HE WAS REPORTED
MISSING BY HIS WIFE.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.856
SOMETIMES THESE GUYS
LAY LOW FOR A WHILE
BEFORE A HIT.

12:34.102 --> 12:34.884
RIGHT.

12:35.144 --> 12:36.976
UH, DO WE KNOW YET
HOW THE MONITORING SYSTEM

12:36.976 --> 12:38.592
AT THE SAFE HOUSE
WAS DISABLED?

12:38.920 --> 12:43.449
WELL, THE FBI SAID THEY'D
GET BACK TO ME ON THAT,
BUT THEY HAVE NOT.

12:44.700 --> 12:45.911
LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

12:46.921 --> 12:49.486
DETECTIVE DANIELS,
DO WE HAVE THE PHONE
AND EMAIL RECORDS

12:49.486 --> 12:51.301
FROM DELUCA'S
SECURITY DETAIL YET?

12:52.460 --> 12:53.148
NO.

12:55.977 --> 12:57.314
IN THE SPIRIT OF
HONEST COOPERATION,

12:57.314 --> 12:59.257
I'LL MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE ALL THOSE
THINGS BEFORE NOON.

13:01.475 --> 13:03.037
LIEUTENANT TAO,
TELL ME WE GOT LUCKY

13:03.037 --> 13:04.650
TRACING THE GUN
THAT KILLED THE VICTIMS.

13:07.439 --> 13:09.278
WE DID AN ACID TEST
TO SEE IF WE COULD FIND

13:09.278 --> 13:11.096
A REGISTRATION NUMBER--
NO LUCK.

13:11.343 --> 13:13.366
NO PRINTS ON THE WEAPON
OR THE AMMO CLIP.

13:13.584 --> 13:17.267
AND WE FOUND ALL 4 SHOTS
FROM THE GUN DELUCA TOOK
FROM AGENT DOHERTY.

13:18.239 --> 13:20.323
[SIGHS]
HOW ARE WE DOING
ON OUR ATTEMPT

13:20.323 --> 13:21.874
TO INTERVIEW
JOSEPH DELLAMONTE?

13:22.170 --> 13:24.190
WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME
GETTING HIM OUT OF

13:24.190 --> 13:26.218
THE FEDERAL DETENTION CENTER
FOR A VISIT.

13:27.668 --> 13:29.596
OK. LET ME GET YOU
A WRIT.

13:29.596 --> 13:31.178
I'VE GOT THE JUDGE'S
NUMBER RIGHT HERE.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.697
YOU KNOW WHAT
I CAN'T STAND?

13:34.558 --> 13:36.473
EVERYBODY TREATS
THESE MAFIA HOODS

13:36.473 --> 13:37.756
LIKE THEY'RE
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

13:38.267 --> 13:40.774
DELLAMONTE,
DELUCA...

13:40.774 --> 13:42.612
IF THESE WEREN'T
WHITE GUYS IN SUITS,

13:42.612 --> 13:44.362
YOU WOULD JUST IGNORE THEM,
RIGHT, FRITZ?

13:46.698 --> 13:48.377
THAT'S ENOUGH,
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.396
UH, HELLO.
LAPD DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

13:55.396 --> 13:57.433
COULD YOU HOLD
FOR JUST A SECOND?
THANK YOU.

13:57.433 --> 13:59.319
IT'S FOR YOU.

14:04.305 --> 14:06.170
SPECIAL AGENT
FRITZ HOWARD OF THE FBI.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.487
TO WHOM AM I SPEAKING,
PLEASE?

14:15.163 --> 14:16.770
LISTEN,
I'M SORRY, FELLAS,

14:16.770 --> 14:18.832
BUT I'M NOT
VERY HUNGRY.

14:19.590 --> 14:20.928
WE HAVE TO PUT
SOME FOOD OUT.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.221
YOU DON'T WANT IT,
DON'T EAT.

14:29.375 --> 14:30.351
WHAT HAPPENED, TIM,
HUH?

14:31.554 --> 14:32.333
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:32.333 --> 14:34.102
MARTY, I'M REALLY
SORRY.

14:34.998 --> 14:37.464
LOOK, WE GOT GUYS
WORKING ON THIS
EVERY WHICH WAY,

14:38.057 --> 14:40.405
BUT YOU GOT TO
CONCENTRATE ON
YOUR TESTIMONY.

14:40.405 --> 14:42.964
DELLAMONTE HAS
TO BE PUNISHED FOR
KILLING MICHELLE.

14:43.429 --> 14:45.485
BY DOING WHAT?
SENDING HIM TO JAIL
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE?

14:46.731 --> 14:49.109
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE
TO MICHELLE NOW, HUH?

15:04.013 --> 15:05.463
WHOA, MARTY, MARTY,
DO ME A FAVOR.

15:05.463 --> 15:06.672
STEP AWAY FROM
THAT FENCE.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.966
AND YOU GOT TO
PUT ON ONE OF THESE.

15:09.673 --> 15:11.236
YEAH.
FOR MY SAFETY, RIGHT?

15:11.236 --> 15:11.835
HERE YOU GO.

15:15.267 --> 15:17.260
USED TO BE,
YOU TOOK A GUY OUT,
THERE WERE RULES.

15:18.263 --> 15:19.412
DON'T SHOOT HIM
IN HIS HOUSE,

15:19.412 --> 15:21.909
DON'T HIT HIS WIFE,
AND NEVER YOUR OWN BLOOD.

15:21.909 --> 15:23.838
NEVER.

15:24.887 --> 15:27.083
NOWADAYS,
IT'S HARD DRUGS,

15:27.083 --> 15:30.676
IDENTITY THEFT,
ILLEGAL ARMS DEALS.

15:30.676 --> 15:32.233
AND IT'S
COAST TO COAST, TOO.

15:33.270 --> 15:34.896
NO MORE TERRITORIES
ANYMORE.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.256
AND NO RESPECT,
EITHER.

15:37.743 --> 15:38.832
NO LOYALTY.

15:39.874 --> 15:40.985
NO HONOR.

15:44.606 --> 15:46.448
AND ON MY THIRD
ANNIVERSARY, TOO.

15:49.096 --> 15:53.996
WHAT A THING TO DO.

16:00.701 --> 16:03.172
Man: MARTY WAS A KILLER,
A GUY WHO SHOT PEOPLE

16:03.172 --> 16:04.730
MY POP DIDN'T LIKE
IN THE BACK OF THEIR
HEADS.

16:05.313 --> 16:06.127
I DON'T NEED
HIT MEN.

16:06.657 --> 16:08.410
MY FAMILY RUNS
A LEGITIMATE
BUSINESS NOW.

16:08.596 --> 16:10.369
JOSEPH, PLEASE,
DON'T TALK.

16:11.058 --> 16:12.437
PRISON FOOD'S
MAKING ME SICK.

16:12.437 --> 16:13.831
THEY FOLLOWED THROUGH
ON THE PASTRY PLATTER.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.082
I'LL LIVE UP TO MY END
OF THE BARGAIN.

16:17.789 --> 16:19.260
MMM. NICE.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.611
I'M NOT GONNA SAY
ANYTHING THAT'S GONNA
GET ME IN TROUBLE

16:21.611 --> 16:22.802
'CAUSE I'M CLEAN.

16:22.802 --> 16:23.946
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
MARTY HAD A WIFE.

16:24.767 --> 16:25.842
WHO WOULD MARRY HIM
ANYWAY?

16:26.186 --> 16:27.648
SO THIS IS THE GUY
WHO FINALLY BROUGHT

16:27.648 --> 16:29.629
A SUCCESSFUL VERSION
OF THE MAFIA TO L.A.

16:30.787 --> 16:33.654
WELL, LOOKS LIKE HE FLOSSES,
YOU KNOW, GOES TO THE GYM.

16:34.670 --> 16:37.261
ALSO HAS AN MBA
FROM HARVARD
BUSINESS SCHOOL.

16:38.718 --> 16:41.286
AND IF I'M NOT
MISTAKEN, WAXES
HIS EYEBROWS.

16:42.105 --> 16:43.983
Brenda: MR. GOODMAN,
THIS IS NOT A COURTROOM.

16:43.983 --> 16:45.808
SAVE YOUR SPEECHES
FOR THE JURY, PLEASE.

16:45.990 --> 16:49.347
MISS JOHNSON,
I AM OFFENDED BY
THE IMPLICATION

16:49.347 --> 16:51.347
THAT I WOULD TRY
AND KNOCK OFF
MARTY DELUCA

16:51.347 --> 16:52.767
WHEN HE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

16:52.767 --> 16:55.795
BESIDES, I WORK
DIFFERENTLY THAN
MY FATHER, MISS JOHNSON.

16:55.795 --> 16:58.655
NOT WITH VIOLENCE
BUT BY IDENTIFYING

16:58.655 --> 17:01.736
AND EXPLOITING
THE WEAKNESSES
OF MY ADVERSARIES,

17:02.423 --> 17:05.087
KNOWING THE PERSON
WHO SITS OPPOSITE
THE TABLE FROM ME.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.035
IT'S HOW I WIN.

17:09.199 --> 17:10.457
MMM. COME ON, COME ON.

17:10.615 --> 17:11.528
HAVE ONE.

17:12.775 --> 17:15.891
SO YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF
MARTIN DELUCA'S TESTIMONY?

17:17.156 --> 17:19.578
HE'S ONLY TALKING TO
THE FBI BECAUSE NOBODY
ELSE WILL LISTEN TO HIM.

17:20.022 --> 17:21.137
HE'S A DINOSAUR.

17:21.349 --> 17:23.313
SIPPING ESPRESSO WITH
HIS PINKY IN THE AIR,

17:23.313 --> 17:24.319
YAPPING ABOUT TRADITION,

17:24.319 --> 17:26.392
AND JUST WHEN
IT HITS MARTY
WHAT A NOBODY HE IS,

17:26.392 --> 17:28.516
THE BUREAU MAKES HIM
FEEL LIKE A BIG MAN.

17:29.072 --> 17:31.228
RIGHT?
GIVES HIM A HOUSE,

17:31.228 --> 17:34.390
TAKES HIM AROUND
THE COUNTRY TO SPREAD
LIES ABOUT MY BUSINESS.

17:34.942 --> 17:37.110
WE GOT YOU ON TAPE
TO DELUCA ORDERING A HIT

17:37.110 --> 17:39.287
ON A BARTENDER WHO SLEPT
WITH YOUR EX-WIFE.

17:39.287 --> 17:42.661
Goodman: YEAH, YOU HAVE
MARTIN DELUCA
CALLING JOSEPH

17:42.661 --> 17:44.976
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT AND ATTEMPTING
TO ENTRAP HIM

17:44.976 --> 17:46.776
WHILE ON
THE FEDERAL PAYROLL.

17:50.399 --> 17:52.747
THAT'S TOM CALI.
DOES HIS NAME RING A BELL?

17:53.515 --> 17:54.782
HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS?

17:55.107 --> 17:59.003
MR. DELUCA IDENTIFIED HIM
AS THE MAN WHO KILLED HIS WIFE
AND AGENT DOHERTY.

18:00.694 --> 18:02.071
TOM CALI ISN'T
MY FRIEND.

18:02.654 --> 18:03.961
IN FACT,
LAST I HEARD OF CALI,

18:03.961 --> 18:05.963
HE WAS HANGING OUT WITH
AGENT HECHT, TOO.

18:07.064 --> 18:10.144
THOUGH, I HAVEN'T
SPOKEN TO ANYONE
WHO'S SEEN HIM RECENTLY.

18:11.573 --> 18:12.581
HAVE YOU?

18:14.795 --> 18:15.422
OH, SORRY.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.350
EXCUSE ME.

18:20.127 --> 18:21.044
RONALD GOODMAN.

18:22.217 --> 18:23.113
YES?

18:24.920 --> 18:25.564
[SCOFFS]
WHO IS THIS?

18:25.564 --> 18:27.092
MR. GOODMAN!

18:28.305 --> 18:29.621
IT'S FOR YOU.

18:37.007 --> 18:38.108
CHIEF JOHNSON.

18:38.108 --> 18:39.899
I AM LOOKING THROUGH
THE PHONE DUMPS OF

18:39.899 --> 18:41.723
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW
WHERE DELUCA WAS BEING HELD.

18:41.723 --> 18:43.789
YOU ARE CALLING ME
ON THE PHONE OF

18:43.789 --> 18:45.917
JOSEPH DELLAMONTE'S
DEFENSE ATTORNEY.
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

18:46.313 --> 18:49.229
YES, MA'AM, I GOT
THE NUMBER FROM AGENT
HECHT'S CELL RECORDS.

18:50.062 --> 18:53.158
AGENT HECHT'S ALSO BEEN
TALKING TO TOM CALI.

18:54.660 --> 18:55.741
THANK YOU,
LIEUTENANT TAO.

18:56.060 --> 18:57.119
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.314
THERE IS A LINE
BETWEEN A VIGOROUS DEFENSE

19:03.314 --> 19:06.151
AND A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY,
AND IF I FIND OUT THAT
YOU'VE CROSSED IT...

19:31.646 --> 19:33.108
WHAT'S WITH
THE CROWN ROYAL BAG?

19:34.449 --> 19:36.037
I KEEP MY GUN IN IT
WHEN I'M OFF DUTY.

19:36.864 --> 19:37.730
IT WAS MARTY'S IDEA.

19:38.601 --> 19:41.938
THE BAGS ARE SUPPLE.
HELPS KEEP THE GUN DRY.

19:43.340 --> 19:46.258
PLUS, IT LOOKS SNAZZY
IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

19:46.856 --> 19:48.208
YEAH?
HEY, PROVENZA.

19:49.006 --> 19:51.041
YOU SHOULD TRY KEEPING
YOUR GUN IN ONE OF
THESE THINGS.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.192
YOU THINK?

19:59.547 --> 20:02.060
OH, HEY, CHIEF.
UH-HUH.

20:03.010 --> 20:05.028
UM, YEAH.

20:06.370 --> 20:06.978
NO.

20:07.346 --> 20:08.322
NO. WHY?

20:15.230 --> 20:15.913
HEY, HECHT.

20:16.713 --> 20:18.760
UH, YOU MIND BRINGING
SOME OF THOSE PLATES, HUH?

20:22.071 --> 20:23.469
CASTRO'S BEAT
THE CARDS.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.597
HOW ARE MY DODGER BOYS
DOING, HUH?

20:30.511 --> 20:31.550
YOU WANT TO WASH OR DRY?

20:33.943 --> 20:36.299
PUT YOUR HANDS UP
ON THE WINDOWSILL
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

20:36.299 --> 20:37.628
YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE.

20:37.628 --> 20:39.740
YEAH. WHATEVER.
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME
REAL GOOD.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.587
I'M GONNA DISARM YOU,
AND IF YOU MAKE
ONE MOVE,

20:42.587 --> 20:45.002
YOUR BRAINS GO OUT THAT
WINDOW, YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:45.002 --> 20:45.834
YEAH.

20:48.336 --> 20:49.414
HEY, PROVENZA!

20:49.414 --> 20:50.583
YOU WANT TO COME
IN HERE?

20:51.155 --> 20:52.330
I COULD USE A HAND.

20:53.163 --> 20:55.379
GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF A MESS TO DEAL WITH.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.328
MAYBE YOU TWO SHOULD
TAKE MR. DELUCA

21:06.328 --> 21:07.729
SOMEPLACE ELSE
FOR THE TIME BEING.

21:08.719 --> 21:10.070
THERE'S NEVER ANYONE
IN THE GYM.

21:10.710 --> 21:11.338
FINE.

21:13.571 --> 21:15.424
MR. DELUCA, I'M SO SORRY
FOR THE FUSS.

21:15.424 --> 21:16.274
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

21:16.274 --> 21:17.693
THIS IS ALL
A BIG MISTAKE.

21:18.326 --> 21:21.151
TIM IS THE ONLY GUY
IN THE WORLD I TRUST.

21:21.151 --> 21:23.213
HE ALWAYS HAS MY BACK.

21:23.213 --> 21:24.560
WELL, IT'S BEEN
MY EXPERIENCE

21:24.560 --> 21:26.569
THE GUY THAT'S GOT
YOUR BACK USUALLY IS

21:26.569 --> 21:28.084
THE PERSON THAT STICKS
A KNIFE IN IT.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.964
YEAH. AND I LOVE YOU, TOO.

21:30.268 --> 21:31.876
TIM WAS BEST MAN
AT MY WEDDING.

21:32.328 --> 21:34.155
HE PAID FOR
THE ANNIVERSARY DINNER

21:34.155 --> 21:35.924
MICHELLE AND I
WERE GOING TO.

21:36.182 --> 21:37.713
I HELP HIM IN HIS WORK.

21:38.296 --> 21:41.428
HE WOULD NEVER, EVER
TRY AND KILL ME.

21:41.726 --> 21:42.558
NEVER.

21:43.384 --> 21:45.276
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR FEELINGS,
MR. DELUCA.

21:45.731 --> 21:47.555
BUT THERE'S STILL
SOME QUESTIONS
THAT I NEED ANSWERED.

21:47.555 --> 21:48.114
Tao: CHIEF.

21:51.043 --> 21:51.736
EXCUSE ME.

21:53.096 --> 21:55.964
SO...HUH?

21:58.831 --> 22:01.334
YEAH. YEAH.
THAT'S IT.

22:01.334 --> 22:04.426
YEAH. WHEN YOU FINISH
DRESSING UP YOUR GUN
IN YOUR LITTLE HANDBAG,

22:04.426 --> 22:06.825
YOU AND YOUR PAL
WANT TO JOIN ME
IN THE GYM?

22:10.380 --> 22:12.168
AHEM. SEE, ANOTHER
NICE THING ABOUT THIS BAG

22:12.168 --> 22:14.575
IS HOW MUCH IT PISSES
FLYNN OFF.

22:16.088 --> 22:17.722
I LIKE IT THAT YOU
ALWAYS TRY AND SEE

22:17.722 --> 22:18.935
THE BRIGHT SIDE,
PROVENZA.

22:19.157 --> 22:21.539
WELL, SUNNY DISPOSITION,
MARTY.

22:22.032 --> 22:24.539
THAT'S HOW I GET THROUGH
ALL THE BULLSHIT
AROUND HERE.

22:25.464 --> 22:26.194
OK.

22:26.194 --> 22:28.982
THIS IS THE WEAPON THAT
KILLED AGENT DOHERTY
AND MICHELLE DELUCA.

22:28.982 --> 22:31.193
THE HAMMER HAS BEEN
SHAVED DOWN,

22:31.193 --> 22:33.017
SO IT WON'T SNAG
IF IT'S DRAWN QUICKLY.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.415
AND THESE GRIPS?
CUSTOM-MADE.

22:36.143 --> 22:38.268
SO WE ARE DEALING WITH
A PROFESSIONAL HIT MAN.

22:39.285 --> 22:40.143
THANK YOU,
LIEUTENANT TAO.

22:40.143 --> 22:41.057
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.

22:42.679 --> 22:43.397
HEY

22:45.044 --> 22:46.601
IF SOMEONE SHAVED
DOWN THE HAMMER

22:46.601 --> 22:48.197
AND CUSTOMIZED THE GRIPS,
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE

22:48.197 --> 22:49.937
THEY'VE MODIFIED THE GUN
IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL?

22:49.937 --> 22:50.823
SURE.

22:52.195 --> 22:55.627
WHEN S.I.D. LOOKED
FOR PRINTS, DID THEY ALSO
LOOK INSIDE THE WEAPON?

22:57.194 --> 22:58.229
THEY DID NOT.

22:58.481 --> 23:00.149
COULD YOU DO IT
RIGHT NOW?

23:01.305 --> 23:03.137
I MIGHT NEED SOME HELP
FROM S.I.D. PERSONNEL,

23:03.137 --> 23:04.389
AND THEY'RE REALLY
BACKED UP.

23:05.771 --> 23:08.630
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GIVE THEM

23:08.630 --> 23:11.950
THEIR USUAL INCENTIVE,
AND I'LL REIMBURSE YOU.

23:15.274 --> 23:17.148
HECHT FLEW INTO
FLAGSTAFF TWO WEEKS AGO.

23:17.148 --> 23:18.799
STAYED 14 HOURS.

23:19.097 --> 23:20.226
THEN WENT RIGHT BACK
TO D.C.

23:21.054 --> 23:24.383
BUT I CHECKED WITH
MR. DELUCA IN
A ROUNDABOUT WAY

23:24.383 --> 23:26.275
AND HE SAID THAT
HECHT HADN'T CHECKED
IN ON THEM

23:26.275 --> 23:28.479
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
UNTIL HE CAME TO DRIVE
WITH THEM TO L.A.

23:28.873 --> 23:30.746
DOES HECHT HAVE ANY OTHER
PROTECTED WITNESSES

23:30.746 --> 23:32.388
IN FLAGSTAFF
OR THE SURROUNDING AREA?

23:34.105 --> 23:34.643
NO.

23:34.643 --> 23:37.057
SO, THEN, WHY WOULD
HE FLY TO FLAGSTAFF

23:37.057 --> 23:38.696
AND NOT CHECK IN
ON MARTY?

23:38.696 --> 23:41.001
WHY NOT JUST WAIT
AND DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO

23:41.001 --> 23:43.556
3 DAYS AGO WHEN
HE FLEW TO FLAGSTAFF
TO TAKE THEM TO L.A.?

23:44.317 --> 23:46.724
HAVE WE FIGURED OUT
HOW THE MONITORING SYSTEM

23:46.724 --> 23:48.233
ON THE SAFE HOUSE
WAS SHUT DOWN?

23:48.233 --> 23:49.751
IT WAS ON
ITS OWN CIRCUIT.

23:49.751 --> 23:51.053
SOMEBODY FLIPPED
THE BREAKER ABOUT

23:51.053 --> 23:52.703
10 MINUTES AFTER
HECHT LOGGED OUT.

23:54.501 --> 23:57.496
SO HECHT FLIES TO FLAGSTAFF
AND DOESN'T CHECK IN
ON HIS WITNESS.

23:57.496 --> 24:01.337
HE CALLS DELLAMONTE'S
LAWYER AND TOM CALI
FROM HIS OWN CELL PHONE.

24:01.337 --> 24:04.312
AND THEN HE LEAVES
THE SAFE HOUSE JUST SECONDS

24:04.312 --> 24:05.924
AFTER THE MONITORING
SYSTEM IS SHUT OFF.

24:06.583 --> 24:09.357
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HIS EXPLANATION IS
FOR ALL THIS,

24:09.357 --> 24:11.459
BUT I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR IT.

24:19.270 --> 24:21.914
Taylor: WASHINGTON WON'T
GIVE US AGENT HECHT'S
PERSONNEL FILE,

24:21.914 --> 24:23.595
AND THEY WANT US
TO HAND HIM OVER NOW.

24:23.595 --> 24:26.460
AND DELUCA WITH HIM.
AND FRANKLY, I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK THIS WHOLE MESS

24:26.460 --> 24:28.417
LOOKS LIKE A PROBLEM
FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.887
WELL, ACTUALLY,
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
THE BEST MOMENT

24:33.887 --> 24:35.611
FOR THE FBI
TO INVESTIGATE ITSELF.

24:35.611 --> 24:37.947
WELL, ALL I CAN SAY
FOR SURE IS THAT

24:37.947 --> 24:40.177
I HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH
TIME TO PREPARE
FOR THIS INTERVIEW.

24:40.177 --> 24:42.937
WE CAN'T HOLD
AN FBI AGENT MUCH LONGER
WITHOUT SOME GOOD EVIDENCE.

24:43.625 --> 24:46.686
ALL RIGHT, BUZZ.
CAN YOU GET ME
THE EARPIECE, PLEASE?

24:47.560 --> 24:49.329
-HERE YOU GO.
-THANK YOU.

24:49.329 --> 24:51.168
LIEUTENANT TAO'S WORKING
ON SOMETHING FOR ME.

24:51.949 --> 24:54.881
SO IF HE HAS SOME
GOOD NEWS, I WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

24:54.881 --> 24:56.512
-YES, MA'AM.
-THANK YOU.

25:00.728 --> 25:03.201
OH, UH, BETTER
IF I DO THIS ONE
WITHOUT YOU.

25:03.201 --> 25:04.241
WHY IS THAT?

25:04.242 --> 25:06.823
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT
I DO TO YOU AT HOME.

25:16.654 --> 25:18.821
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN HERE?

25:19.659 --> 25:21.228
AGENT HECHT,
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE A SEAT?

25:21.228 --> 25:24.503
I AM AN AGENT OF
THE FEDERAL BUREAU
OF INVESTIGATION.

25:24.503 --> 25:27.488
YOU CANNOT PULL ME
IN HERE AT GUNPOINT

25:27.488 --> 25:29.092
AND QUESTION
MY INTEGRITY.

25:29.092 --> 25:31.179
AGENT HECHT,
I'M TRYING TO CLEAR
YOUR NAME.

25:31.757 --> 25:33.934
DO YOU THINK THAT
THE LAPD HAD ANYTHING

25:33.934 --> 25:36.067
TO DO WITH RAISING
THESE TRUST ISSUES?

25:36.068 --> 25:37.315
OF COURSE NOT.

25:37.315 --> 25:40.153
THIS IS ENTIRELY
THE FAULT OF THE FBI.

25:40.153 --> 25:41.381
THEY INSISTED
WE DISARM YOU.

25:41.787 --> 25:44.066
IN FACT, IF IT WEREN'T
FOR THE LAPD,
AGENT HOWARD...

25:44.066 --> 25:46.293
SO WHEN YOU'RE AT HOME,
DOES SHE BLAME YOU
FOR EVERYTHING?

25:46.564 --> 25:48.024
WELL, LATELY.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.494
...YOUR APARTMENT
AND COMPUTER FILES
RIGHT NOW.

25:49.494 --> 25:51.310
Hecht: WHY?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:51.544 --> 25:53.368
YOU KNEW WHERE
THE DELUCAS
WERE STAYING.

25:53.368 --> 25:55.094
YOU LOGGED OUT OF
THEIR SAFE HOUSE

25:55.094 --> 25:58.574
10 MINUTES BEFORE
THE MONITORING SYSTEM
WAS SHUT DOWN.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.592
YOU PLANNED
THEIR NIGHT OUT,

26:01.065 --> 26:02.363
BUT YOU DIDN'T
GO WITH THEM.

26:02.363 --> 26:05.529
I HAD A MEETING
WITH THE U.S. ATTORNEY
ABOUT THE TRIAL.

26:05.529 --> 26:08.754
AFTER 3 SUCCESSFUL
PROSECUTIONS TOGETHER,

26:08.754 --> 26:10.591
AND 3 MORE TO COME,
BY THE WAY,

26:10.591 --> 26:13.907
I KNOW HOW LAWYERS
NEED TO TREAT MARTY
ON THE STAND.

26:13.907 --> 26:14.937
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
AGENT HECHT,

26:14.937 --> 26:16.134
I'M JUST GONNA BE
PERFECTLY BLUNT.

26:16.134 --> 26:18.289
BECAUSE YOUR BOSSES
ARE GONNA TELL YOU
THE SAME THING

26:18.289 --> 26:19.788
WHEN YOU GO IN
FOR YOUR POLYGRAPH--

26:19.788 --> 26:21.822
MY POLYGRAPH?!

26:21.822 --> 26:24.940
WHY AM I BEING GIVEN
A LIE DETECTOR TEST?

26:25.099 --> 26:27.131
AGENT HOWARD
HAS PROPOSED A THEORY

26:27.966 --> 26:30.117
THAT MR. DELUCA
DOESN'T REALLY KNOW
VERY MUCH ABOUT

26:30.117 --> 26:31.389
THE DELLAMONTE
ORGANIZATION,

26:31.389 --> 26:34.535
THAT HIS TESTIMONY
CONSISTS LARGELY OF
INFORMATION

26:34.535 --> 26:37.158
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM
TO MEMORIZE,

26:37.788 --> 26:39.618
THAT YOU'RE
SUBORNING PERJURY.

26:39.618 --> 26:40.872
THAT IS A LIE!

26:41.568 --> 26:44.725
MARTIN DELUCA IS
THE ONLY MEMBER OF
THE DELLAMONTE FAMILY

26:44.725 --> 26:47.215
TO EVER TURN
STATE'S EVIDENCE,

26:47.215 --> 26:49.258
AND I'M THE ONE THAT
CONVINCED HIM TO DO IT.

26:49.546 --> 26:50.609
HEY, DON'T GET
MAD AT ME.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.628
I'M JUST THE MESSENGER.

26:51.628 --> 26:54.048
MARTY AND I TELL
EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

26:54.048 --> 26:54.947
EVERYTHING!

26:57.290 --> 26:58.255
OK.

26:59.504 --> 27:01.911
THERE IS NO COACHING
NECESSARY.

27:02.295 --> 27:04.152
AND THEN THERE'S
THE STUFF WITH YOU
AND TOM CALI.

27:05.633 --> 27:06.914
TOM CALI.

27:11.112 --> 27:12.742
WHAT DOES HE HAVE
TO DO WITH THIS?

27:12.742 --> 27:14.735
MARTY PICKED CALI'S
PHOTOGRAPH OUT OF

27:14.735 --> 27:16.938
A PACKET OF KNOWN
DELLAMONTE ASSOCIATES

27:16.938 --> 27:18.683
AND IDENTIFIED HIM
AS THE SHOOTER.

27:18.683 --> 27:20.323
AND AGENT HOWARD
HAS LEARNED THAT YOU

27:20.323 --> 27:22.084
AND TOM CALI WERE
SPENDING TIME TOGETHER.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.236
CALI'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

27:30.550 --> 27:31.677
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE IS?

27:32.230 --> 27:33.293
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

27:33.754 --> 27:34.293
NO.

27:34.293 --> 27:35.897
WHY DID YOU GO TO
FLAGSTAFF TWO WEEKS AGO

27:35.897 --> 27:37.346
AND STAY THERE
FOR 14 HOURS?

27:39.006 --> 27:42.999
MICHELLE DELUCA
HAD TO VISIT A DOCTOR
FOR A FEMALE THING.

27:43.457 --> 27:47.783
AND THE FBI SCREENS
ALL PROFESSIONAL CONTACTS
LIKE THAT.

27:47.783 --> 27:49.905
PHYSICIANS, DENTISTS...

27:49.905 --> 27:52.079
MR. DELUCA SAID
HE DIDN'T SEE YOU.
IS HE LYING?

27:53.406 --> 27:54.073
NO.

27:54.567 --> 27:56.699
AND I THOUGHT
YOU TOLD EACH OTHER
EVERYTHING.

28:00.218 --> 28:02.880
OK. I'VE GOT JUST
ONE LAST BIT OF
BUSINESS HERE.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.730
THESE ARE YOUR
CELL PHONE RECORDS,

28:04.730 --> 28:08.208
AND ALONG WITH, UM,
SEVERAL CALLS MADE
TO TOM CALI...

28:10.167 --> 28:11.727
3 DAYS AGO
YOU APPARENTLY MADE

28:11.727 --> 28:13.037
CONTACT WITH
RONALD GOODMAN,

28:13.037 --> 28:14.549
JOSEPH DELLAMONTE'S
DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

28:15.676 --> 28:17.727
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D LIKE
TO SHARE WITH ME

28:17.727 --> 28:20.127
WHAT YOU AND
RONALD GOODMAN
HAD TO DISCUSS.

28:23.288 --> 28:25.854
Buzz: CHIEF,
LIEUTENANT TAO
FOUND A THUMBPRINT

28:25.854 --> 28:26.852
INSIDE THE MURDER
WEAPON.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.716
I AM NOT GONNA
ANSWER THAT.

28:36.231 --> 28:39.092
AND IF YOU ASK ME
ONE MORE QUESTION,

28:39.092 --> 28:41.471
I'M INVOKING
MY RIGHT TO COUNSEL.

28:43.122 --> 28:46.782
IF YOU NEED A LAWYER,
I HEAR DELLAMONTE HAS
A GOOD ONE.

28:46.782 --> 28:48.487
AND YOU ALREADY
HAVE HIS NUMBER.

28:59.465 --> 29:02.563
CHIEF, LIEUTENANT TAO
FOUND A CLEAN THUMBPRINT
ON THE MURDER WEAPON.

29:02.563 --> 29:04.676
IT WAS ON THE FRAME
UNDERNEATH THE LEFT GRIP.

29:05.038 --> 29:06.658
PRISTINE.
RAN IT THROUGH AFIS.

29:07.394 --> 29:08.350
GOT A MATCH.

29:09.553 --> 29:10.994
LAWRENCE MORAN.

29:13.328 --> 29:14.613
OH, THIS JUST
GETS WORSE.

29:15.365 --> 29:16.277
YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

29:17.114 --> 29:20.080
YEAH. HE'S
A PROFESSIONALLY
TRAINED KILLER

29:20.631 --> 29:21.714
BUT NOT
BY THE MOB.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.103
THEN BY WHOM?

29:24.749 --> 29:26.093
BY THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT.

29:26.543 --> 29:28.171
HE WAS A SNIPER
HONORABLY DISCHARGED

29:28.171 --> 29:29.627
AFTER THE FIRST
GULF WAR.

29:29.627 --> 29:32.571
NOW HE'S A SMALL
ARMS ENTREPRENEUR.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.547
BASICALLY,
A LICENSED
GUN DEALER.

29:34.547 --> 29:36.931
SO IF YOU KNOW HIM,
MAYBE HECHT DOES, TOO.

29:37.349 --> 29:40.576
HAS THE BUREAU BEEN
ACTIVELY TRACKING
THIS MAN'S WHEREABOUTS?

29:41.482 --> 29:43.976
YEAH, WELL,
SORT OF.

29:44.872 --> 29:47.126
Tao: YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO TOO MUCH
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

29:48.195 --> 29:50.804
MORAN KEEPS A SCHEDULE
ON HIS WEB CALENDAR. SEE?

29:50.804 --> 29:53.280
IT'S A LIST OF GUN SHOWS
HE'S APPEARING AT THIS MONTH.

29:53.721 --> 29:55.142
Gabriel:
MORAN GETS AROUND.

29:55.894 --> 29:57.384
IS HE IN SAN DIEGO NOW?

29:57.626 --> 29:58.940
MAYBE NOT LAST NIGHT.

30:02.665 --> 30:04.903
HE DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE
TOM CALI, DOES HE?

30:04.903 --> 30:07.187
MAYBE HE JUST SOLD
TOM CALI THE WEAPON.

30:07.187 --> 30:10.120
YOU KNOW, I CAN IMPRESS
ON THE SAN DIEGO PD

30:10.120 --> 30:12.027
HOW MUCH WE WANT
MORAN PICKED UP.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.185
HOW SOON?

30:13.185 --> 30:15.110
THAT WOULD BE
VERY MUCH APPRECIATED,
COMMANDER, THANK YOU.

30:19.499 --> 30:20.428
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

30:20.428 --> 30:22.017
IT'LL TAKE HOURS
FOR MORAN TO GET HERE,

30:22.017 --> 30:23.464
AND I CAN'T
DOWNLOAD STUFF.

30:23.464 --> 30:24.501
IT'S JUST A PICTURE.

30:24.868 --> 30:25.872
BUT I HAVE TO
PRINT IT OUT,

30:25.872 --> 30:27.091
AND IT'S ALWAYS
A PROBLEM!

30:27.718 --> 30:29.246
LOOK, IF YOU WANT
TO GO HOME AND LOOK AROUND

30:29.246 --> 30:30.410
AND SEE IF KITTY
HAS COME BACK,

30:30.410 --> 30:31.764
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SAY SO?

30:33.268 --> 30:35.312
I WANT TO GO HOME
AND SEE IF KITTY'S
COME BACK.

30:37.820 --> 30:40.592
SEE? THAT WASN'T SO HARD.

30:42.945 --> 30:44.248
OH, CHIEF.

30:44.248 --> 30:45.043
ARE YOU LEAVING?

30:45.043 --> 30:47.984
UH, NO.
I'M...NO. WHAT?

30:47.984 --> 30:48.731
WHAT IS IT?

30:48.731 --> 30:50.917
I GOT THE REPORT BACK
FROM THE MORGUE.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.343
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT MEANS ANYTHING,

30:52.343 --> 30:55.146
BUT THE AUTOPSY
SHOWED MICHELLE DELUCA

30:55.146 --> 30:56.636
DIDN'T LOSE HER BABY
AFTER ALL.

30:57.863 --> 30:59.007
SHE HAD AN ABORTION?

31:01.122 --> 31:02.748
THANK YOU,
DETECTIVE DANIELS.

31:07.741 --> 31:08.735
YOU THINK
THAT'S IMPORTANT?

31:08.735 --> 31:10.155
AGENT HECHT
THOUGHT SO.

31:10.853 --> 31:13.096
NOW WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT WHY.

31:23.761 --> 31:25.062
Computer:
YOU'VE GOT MAIL.

31:25.062 --> 31:27.437
OH! GOSH.
OH, SORRY.

31:29.202 --> 31:30.266
IT'S OK.

31:30.815 --> 31:31.990
LOOK AT HOW EASY
THIS IS.

31:32.563 --> 31:33.959
NOW, FOR
IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES,

31:33.959 --> 31:36.517
PICTURES AREN'T THAT
GOOD, EVEN FOR PEOPLE.

31:36.517 --> 31:37.966
BUT HERE. WHY DON'T
YOU TRY THIS?

31:37.966 --> 31:39.389
OH, CAN'T YOU
JUST DO IT FOR ME?

31:39.389 --> 31:40.109
PLEASE?

31:40.991 --> 31:42.011
OK.

31:43.756 --> 31:45.856
THERE. SEE HOW
EASY THAT IS?

31:50.522 --> 31:51.828
CAN YOU, UH...

31:53.484 --> 31:55.385
COPY IT INTO
A THINGY AND...

31:56.504 --> 31:59.219
MAKE A FLYER, AND PUT
OUR ADDRESS ON IT?

31:59.219 --> 32:01.282
OH...
HEY.

32:02.729 --> 32:03.921
KITTY WILL
COME BACK.

32:03.921 --> 32:05.698
I DON'T MEAN
TO BE SILLY.

32:05.698 --> 32:07.720
HE'S JUST
A STUPID CAT.

32:09.089 --> 32:09.901
SHE'S...

32:10.177 --> 32:11.558
JUST A STUPID CAT.

32:13.745 --> 32:14.868
LOVING HER
ISN'T SILLY.

32:16.049 --> 32:17.013
OK?

32:19.486 --> 32:21.439
AND BY THE WAY,
DID YOU EVER GET
KITTY SPAYED?

32:44.439 --> 32:45.436
BAD KITTY!

32:45.436 --> 32:47.232
BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD!

32:47.232 --> 32:50.119
AND LOOK AT YOU.
YOU ARE A MESS!

32:50.119 --> 32:51.280
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING?

32:52.361 --> 32:53.752
I KNOW YOU'RE GOOD
AT YOUR JOB, HONEY,

32:53.752 --> 32:55.342
BUT I DON'T THINK
KITTY'S GONNA
ANSWER YOU.

33:00.009 --> 33:02.624
FRITZY SAYS
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

33:05.905 --> 33:07.029
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT IT,

33:08.500 --> 33:10.045
DO WE EVER REALLY
KNOW WHAT KITTY'S

33:10.045 --> 33:11.812
DOING WHEN OUR
BACKS ARE TURNED?

33:12.182 --> 33:15.026
SHE'S PROBABLY
PARTYING EVERY DAY
WHILE WE'RE AT WORK,

33:16.001 --> 33:18.045
INVITING
OTHER CATS OVER,

33:19.123 --> 33:20.539
SMOKING CATNIP,

33:21.495 --> 33:25.443
SCRATCHING HERSELF
IN ODD PLACES.

33:36.587 --> 33:38.560
[SOUTHERN DRAWL]
DEPUTY CHIEF BRENDA
JOHNSON'S LINE.

33:40.582 --> 33:43.579
[NORMAL VOICE]
HEY, SERGEANT.
THAT'S GREAT.

33:44.149 --> 33:46.753
WHEN EXACTLY
DO YOU EXPECT
MORAN TO ARRIVE?

33:51.298 --> 33:52.615
Gabriel: WE READ HIM
HIS RIGHTS,

33:52.615 --> 33:53.787
AND HE'S CALLED
FOR A LAWYER.

33:53.787 --> 33:56.981
BUT WE FOUND A FULLY
AUTOMATIC WEAPON
HIDDEN IN HIS VAN,

33:56.981 --> 33:58.602
SO HIS ASS IS OURS.

33:58.602 --> 34:01.824
OH. PERFECT.
THANKS.

34:01.824 --> 34:04.512
NOW, IF YOU COULD
GET AGENT HECHT
TO MY OFFICE

34:04.512 --> 34:06.515
AND KEEP HIM THERE,
PLEASE.

34:06.515 --> 34:08.558
AND, DETECTIVE DANIELS,
IF YOU COULD ASK

34:08.558 --> 34:10.978
LIEUTENANTS FLYNN
AND PROVENZA TO BRING
MR. DELUCA ALONG.

34:10.978 --> 34:14.274
I WANT TO INTERVIEW
AGENT HECHT IN FRONT
OF MR. DELUCA.

34:14.274 --> 34:15.400
AT LEAST TO BEGIN WITH.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.101
THANKS.
MM-HMM.

34:18.650 --> 34:19.971
WANT TO GO SEE
A GUN DEALER WITH ME?

34:20.530 --> 34:22.291
WHY? WANT TO BLAME ME
FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

34:22.291 --> 34:24.588
NO, IN FACT,
I WANT TO DO FOR YOU

34:24.588 --> 34:27.150
WHAT AGENT HECHT WOULDN'T
DARE DO FOR MARTY DELUCA.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.600
WHAT'S THAT?
EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

34:32.891 --> 34:34.735
Moran: I'M NOT TALKING
WITHOUT A LAWYER.

34:34.735 --> 34:36.533
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D WAIVE MY RIGHT
TO COUNSEL.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.293
REALLY? WHY WOULD
YOU DO THAT?

34:38.293 --> 34:41.440
BECAUSE CARRYING
A CONCEALED FULLY
AUTOMATIC WEAPON

34:41.440 --> 34:43.717
IN YOUR VEHICLE
IS A FEDERAL CRIME

34:43.717 --> 34:45.415
THAT COULD HAVE YOU
DOING SOME SERIOUS TIME.

34:45.929 --> 34:47.235
MANDATORY
10-YEAR SENTENCE.

34:48.036 --> 34:49.713
SO IF YOU DON'T WAIVE
YOUR RIGHT TO COUNSEL,

34:49.713 --> 34:51.753
I'LL HAVE TO HAVE
AGENT HOWARD HERE
ARREST YOU.

34:52.208 --> 34:53.543
AND THEN IT'S
OUT OF MY HANDS.

34:53.953 --> 34:55.750
OF COURSE, IF YOU CHOOSE
TO COOPERATE,

34:55.750 --> 34:59.065
I MAY NEED TO TEST
THIS WEAPON TO DETERMINE
IF IT'S FULLY AUTOMATIC,

34:59.065 --> 35:00.616
MAKE SURE IT WORKS.

35:00.616 --> 35:02.045
AND THAT COULD TAKE
5 YEARS,

35:02.045 --> 35:05.862
DEPENDING ON HOW
QUICKLY YOU GET
WITH THE PROGRAM.

35:05.862 --> 35:08.029
WOW. THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.

35:08.903 --> 35:11.897
WHOOPS! NOW WE'RE
TESTING YOUR WEAPON
IN 4 YEARS, 3...

35:11.897 --> 35:13.206
TWO...
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON!

35:14.862 --> 35:16.139
I WAIVE MY RIGHT
TO COUNSEL.

35:16.139 --> 35:17.354
THAT'S GREAT.

35:20.506 --> 35:23.580
YOUR FINGERPRINTS
WERE FOUND ON THE FRAME

35:23.580 --> 35:25.286
UNDER THE GRIP PANEL
OF THIS GUN.

35:25.286 --> 35:27.460
IS THAT WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT, MY PRINTS
BEING ON ONE OF

35:27.460 --> 35:29.083
300 GUNS THAT
I SOLD LAST YEAR?

35:29.083 --> 35:30.648
THIS ONE WAS USED
IN A HOMICIDE,

35:30.648 --> 35:32.492
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER

35:32.492 --> 35:35.752
HOW MANY .45 CALIBER SIGS
WITH CUSTOM GRIPS
YOU SOLD LAST YEAR.

35:35.752 --> 35:37.413
7 OR 8 WITH
CUSTOM GRIPS.

35:37.413 --> 35:38.866
3 WITH THE HAMMER
SHAVED DOWN.

35:38.866 --> 35:39.946
WHO'D YOU SELL
THEM TO?

35:39.946 --> 35:41.083
I DON'T KNOW NAMES.

35:41.482 --> 35:42.737
YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
A PICTURE,

35:42.737 --> 35:44.274
MAYBE YOU HAVE ME
PICK SOMEBODY
OUT OF A LINEUP.

35:44.283 --> 35:45.692
NO. PICTURES
AREN'T RELIABLE,

35:46.967 --> 35:48.708
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SET UP A LINEUP.

35:48.708 --> 35:50.697
NO, I THINK I PREFER
TO SETTLE THIS ISSUE

35:52.038 --> 35:53.217
WITH A HANDSHAKE.

35:57.875 --> 35:59.652
BUZZ, DO YOU HAVE YOUR
VIDEO CAMERA HANDY?

35:59.652 --> 36:00.644
YES, MA'AM.
RIGHT HERE.

36:00.644 --> 36:02.703
OK, I NEED YOU
TO SET IT UP BY
THE MURDER BOARD.

36:02.703 --> 36:04.149
I HAVE SOME EVIDENCE
I NEED TO FILM.

36:04.149 --> 36:07.189
AND DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
I NEED YOU TO PROVIDE
A POLICE ESCORT FOR ME.

36:08.162 --> 36:08.937
FOR WHO?

36:10.288 --> 36:11.901
RIGHT THIS WAY,
MR. DELUCA.

36:16.350 --> 36:20.142
TIM. IT'S NOT TRUE,
IS IT?

36:22.235 --> 36:24.069
YOU HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS,
DID YOU?

36:25.404 --> 36:26.941
THANK Y'ALL
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

36:26.941 --> 36:29.825
WE HAVE QUITE A FEW
THINGS TO CLEAR UP,

36:29.825 --> 36:32.645
AND A PRETTY
SERIOUS DEADLINE.

36:32.645 --> 36:34.421
SO I'M JUST GONNA
JUMP RIGHT IN.

36:34.421 --> 36:38.091
MR. DELUCA, DID YOU KNOW
YOUR WIFE HAD AN ABORTION?

36:42.212 --> 36:44.518
MR. DELUCA, IF YOUR
WIFE HAD AN ABORTION...

36:44.518 --> 36:47.238
PLEASE DON'T USE
THAT WORD.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.843
LET'S JUST SAY
SHE LOST THE BABY, OK?

36:50.843 --> 36:54.254
SO YOU KNEW YOUR WIFE
WAS TERMINATING
HER PREGNANCY?

36:56.360 --> 36:58.789
SHE TOLD ME AFTER. YEAH.

37:00.394 --> 37:01.760
TWO WEEKS AGO, YES?

37:02.909 --> 37:05.182
YES.

37:05.182 --> 37:07.064
AND WHEN MICHELLE
PLANNED THAT PROCEDURE,

37:07.064 --> 37:10.345
WOULD THE PHYSICIAN
HAVE TO HAVE BEEN SCREENED
BY AGENT HECHT HERE?

37:12.311 --> 37:15.900
WELL, YEAH,
BUT WE DIDN'T ALWAYS...

37:16.706 --> 37:19.176
THIS WASN'T THE KIND
OF THING THAT MICHELLE

37:19.176 --> 37:21.617
WANTED TO DISCUSS
WITH ANYONE BUT ME.

37:22.402 --> 37:24.188
AS I TOLD
THIS YOUNG FELLA HERE,

37:24.188 --> 37:26.860
TIM DIDN'T COME
TO FLAGSTAFF UNTIL

37:26.860 --> 37:28.809
THE NIGHT BEFORE
WE DROVE TO L.A.

37:28.809 --> 37:31.611
BUT AGENT HECHT
WAS IN FLAGSTAFF
TWO WEEKS AGO.

37:31.611 --> 37:34.787
AND THOUGH HE MIGHT
NOT HAVE SEEN YOU,
HE DID SEE MICHELLE.

37:34.787 --> 37:37.277
IN FACT, I'M PRETTY
SURE HE WENT WITH HER
TO THE DOCTOR.

37:38.664 --> 37:39.527
NO.

37:42.364 --> 37:43.575
HE WOULDN'T.

37:47.744 --> 37:48.795
DID YOU DO THAT?

37:52.224 --> 37:54.138
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

37:55.540 --> 37:58.125
MARTY, SHE WAS GONNA
HAVE THE ABORTION ANYWAY.

37:58.125 --> 37:59.846
SHE WAS GONNA
HAVE IT ANYWAY.

37:59.846 --> 38:02.779
WHAT I DID,
I DID TO PROTECT YOU
AND MICHELLE.

38:02.779 --> 38:06.444
I WAS PROTECTING YOU
LIKE I'M PROTECTING YOU NOW.

38:06.986 --> 38:08.015
PROTECT ME?

38:08.616 --> 38:10.854
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT ANYMORE,
'CAUSE THE DEAL IS OFF.

38:11.389 --> 38:13.935
I DON'T TESTIFY FOR YOU
NO MORE. NO MORE.

38:13.935 --> 38:15.281
MARTY, LET ME EXPLAIN.

38:15.281 --> 38:16.834
NO, LET ME EXPLAIN!

38:17.553 --> 38:20.434
I DO NOTHING FOR YOU
EVER AGAIN, YOU HEAR ME?
NOTHING!

38:20.434 --> 38:22.064
NOTHING! NOTHING!

38:22.064 --> 38:24.412
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
MR. DELUCA. THANK YOU.

38:25.004 --> 38:27.196
YOU CAN WAIT OUTSIDE.
SERGEANT GABRIEL.

38:39.452 --> 38:40.604
GOD!

38:41.980 --> 38:45.221
JOSEPH DELLAMONTE COULD
WALK BECAUSE OF YOU.

38:48.058 --> 38:49.632
YOU CAN SIT RIGHT HERE,
MR. DELUCA.

38:52.256 --> 38:53.461
HOW YOU HOLDING UP,
MARTY?

38:55.245 --> 38:58.015
I, UH, CAN'T TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW,
PROVENZA, I'M SORRY.

38:59.115 --> 39:00.123
SURE. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

39:00.992 --> 39:02.279
I HAVE PLENTY OF
PAPERWORK TO DO HERE.

39:07.791 --> 39:10.315
Hecht: WHY WOULD YOU END
ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

39:10.315 --> 39:14.029
PARTNERSHIPS THE FBI
HAS EVER HAD WITH
A MOB INFORMANT?

39:14.029 --> 39:15.441
SO YOU WOULD
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

39:15.441 --> 39:16.592
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
ANYTHING.

39:16.592 --> 39:17.949
YOU'VE ALREADY
TOLD ME PLENTY.

39:18.892 --> 39:21.979
FOR EXAMPLE, JUST NOW
YOU SAID YOU AND MARTY
WERE PARTNERS.

39:22.326 --> 39:25.051
AND EARLIER TODAY,
YOU SAID, "I TELL
MARTY EVERYTHING."

39:25.051 --> 39:28.728
SO, DID YOU, FOR EXAMPLE,
TELL MR. DELUCA THAT

39:28.728 --> 39:31.649
YOU WERE TRYING TO TURN
TOM CALI AGAINST
THE DELLAMONTE FAMILY?

39:32.082 --> 39:34.850
DID YOU ASK HIS ADVICE?
REPORT ON YOUR PROGRESS?

39:35.250 --> 39:39.435
DID YOU INFORM MR. DELUCA
THAT TOM CALI HAD GONE MISSING
AND WAS PRESUMED DEAD,

39:39.435 --> 39:41.220
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,
IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY

39:41.220 --> 39:44.239
MR. DELUCA THOUGHT
IT WAS SAFE TO IDENTIFY
TOM CALI AS THE KILLER.

39:45.431 --> 39:48.458
YOU KNEW THE FIRST TIME
SHE ASKED YOU ABOUT CALI
WHAT MARTY HAD DONE.

39:49.752 --> 39:50.960
DIDN'T YOU, TIM?

39:52.127 --> 39:54.125
AND YOU WERE AT
THE DELUCA HOUSE
3 DAYS AGO

39:54.641 --> 39:57.839
WHEN THE CALL
TO JOSEPH DELLAMONTE'S
LAWYER WAS MADE.

39:58.951 --> 40:02.700
IS IT POSSIBLE, SIR,
THAT YOU LOANED MR. DELUCA

40:02.700 --> 40:04.020
YOUR CELL PHONE
DURING THAT TIME?

40:06.018 --> 40:08.480
Pope: AGENT HECHT?
AGENT HECHT.

40:09.049 --> 40:10.897
I SUGGEST YOU ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

40:12.903 --> 40:15.150
WHO WATCHES THE DELUCAS
WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND, SIR?

40:15.809 --> 40:16.790
ANYONE?

40:16.790 --> 40:18.799
THEY DON'T NEED
ANYBODY TO WATCH THEM.

40:18.799 --> 40:20.207
APPARENTLY, THEY DID.

40:20.207 --> 40:23.702
MICHELLE AND
AGENT DOHERTY WERE MURDERED
BY A PROFESSIONAL KILLER.

40:23.702 --> 40:27.095
WE KNOW THAT.
AND WHAT IS
MARTIN DELUCA, SIR?

40:28.576 --> 40:32.470
WHEN YOUR BACK IS TURNED,
COULD HE, SAY, DRIVE OUT
OF STATE AND PURCHASE A WEAPON?

40:32.470 --> 40:34.815
COULD HE HAVE PUT
THAT WEAPON IN HIS LUGGAGE,

40:34.815 --> 40:38.990
KNOWING THAT HE WAS
TRAVELING BY CAR FROM
FLAGSTAFF TO LOS ANGELES?

40:38.990 --> 40:41.358
DID YOU SEARCH
YOUR PARTNER, SIR?

40:42.116 --> 40:45.326
DID YOU SHOW YOUR PARTNER
HOW TO USE THE MONITORING
SYSTEM AT THE SAFE HOUSE?

40:45.632 --> 40:47.269
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

40:47.269 --> 40:49.857
WE'VE GOT A VERY
IMPORTANT TRIAL
TOMORROW.

40:49.857 --> 40:52.814
SO MARTIN DELUCA
COULD PUT HIS WIFE
IN THE FRONT SEAT

40:52.814 --> 40:55.374
OF A FEDERAL VEHICLE,
HE COULD STEP OUT OF IT,

40:55.374 --> 41:00.300
SHOOT HER TO DEATH,
ALONG WITH ONE OF
YOUR FELLOW FBI AGENTS,

41:00.300 --> 41:04.378
STAGE THE CRIME SCENE,
WHILE FRAMING YOU
IN THE PROCESS,

41:04.378 --> 41:06.541
AND YOU JUST TURN
YOUR BACK AND IGNORE IT

41:06.541 --> 41:09.219
ALL BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
PUT A MOB FAMILY IN PRISON?

41:09.845 --> 41:13.417
SIR, I BELIEVE YOU HAVE
LOST YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

41:13.987 --> 41:17.218
NO, NO. HE LOVED HER.
HE COULDN'T HAVE KILLED
MICHELLE.

41:17.799 --> 41:19.026
BUT HE HAD TO.

41:19.026 --> 41:22.222
BECAUSE TO MARTY'S
WAY OF THINKING,
SHE KILLED HIS CHILD.

41:23.543 --> 41:26.329
AND HE MAY BE
A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT

41:26.329 --> 41:28.291
WHAT TRADITIONAL
FAMILY VALUES ARE,

41:28.291 --> 41:30.367
BUT HE ISN'T ONE
TO MESS AROUND WITH THEM.

41:30.938 --> 41:33.570
AND YOU KNEW THAT,
AGENT HECHT.

41:33.570 --> 41:35.666
WHICH IS WHY YOU TOOK
MICHELLE TO THE DOCTOR

41:35.666 --> 41:37.179
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL
MARTY ABOUT IT.

41:37.940 --> 41:39.031
BUT HE KNOWS NOW.

41:39.892 --> 41:42.891
AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIM IS OVER.

41:43.563 --> 41:45.495
SO I WANT YOU TO STOP
PROTECTING MR. DELUCA

41:45.495 --> 41:46.618
AND START TELLING ME
THE TRUTH.

41:46.618 --> 41:50.538
IT IS YOUR TURN, SIR,
TO BE THE WITNESS.

41:52.546 --> 41:54.852
OH, THAT'S A VERY
GOOD STORY, MA'AM.

41:54.852 --> 41:56.405
BUT WHEN YOU GET
IN A COURTROOM,

41:56.405 --> 41:58.843
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LITTLE EVIDENCE
TO BACK THAT UP

41:58.843 --> 41:59.981
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY.

42:01.947 --> 42:03.077
OH, YES, I DO.

42:03.613 --> 42:06.038
IN FACT, HE'S COMING
INTO MY SQUAD ROOM
RIGHT NOW.

42:14.952 --> 42:17.780
SORRY TO MEET UP
AGAIN LIKE THIS, BUDDY,
BUT IT WAS YOU OR ME.

42:18.633 --> 42:20.457
AGENT HECHT.
AGENT HECHT!

42:20.457 --> 42:22.239
MARTY! MARTY,
IT'S A TRAP.

42:22.239 --> 42:24.820
MR. DELUCA,
I SEE YOU'VE MET
MR. MORAN AGAIN.

42:24.870 --> 42:27.328
MARTY, DON'T SAY
ANYTHING UNTIL I GET
YOU A LAWYER.

42:27.989 --> 42:30.149
MARTY, WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT?

42:31.597 --> 42:36.272
YOU KILLED MY CHILD.

43:11.190 --> 43:12.423
Flynn: DROP
YOUR WEAPON.

43:12.487 --> 43:15.515
EVERYBODY, STOP,
