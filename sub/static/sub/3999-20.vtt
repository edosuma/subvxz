WEBVTT

00:17.718 --> 00:19.685
Okay, Schmidt, you ready for
your feedback for the week?

00:19.687 --> 00:21.553
Yes. Uh, let me just pull up
my performance grid.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.489
First off, thanks for
keeping sex quick.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.524
You were like a dog
with an ice cream cone,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.059
and I loved it,
but screaming

00:27.061 --> 00:29.962
"that's how Schmidty do"
was not ideal.

00:29.964 --> 00:32.631
Even though that's how
Sch-Schmidty did?

00:32.633 --> 00:34.466
Well, Schmidty did,
and he did it good,

00:34.468 --> 00:35.868
but mommy doesn't
want to hear

00:35.870 --> 00:37.536
how Schmidty's doing.
Note... note taken.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.238
Okay. Great. Good.
Note taken.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.409
I feel like I'm watching a porn
set in an HR department.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.911
You know, Fawn is teaching me
how to be the most effective

00:45.913 --> 00:47.813
and successful man
and lover I possibly can be.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.648
Really?
I thought you were fine before.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.083
When you two were
together? Which time?

00:51.085 --> 00:52.751
The... the first time
or the third time?

00:52.753 --> 00:53.719
Because... 'cause you two

00:53.721 --> 00:55.054
were very off-and-on.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.589
In a... in a very
confusing way.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.893
(laughs) I've had sex
with him so many times.

01:00.895 --> 01:02.694
We have a fun thing
together, don't we?

01:02.696 --> 01:04.596
Super fun, yeah.
I really enjoy it.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.498
What is her...
what is it, Cecil?

01:06.500 --> 01:07.766
What is your name?

01:07.768 --> 01:09.401
You'll learn it.
Don't worry.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.103
Fawn's helping me see
that I haven't reached

01:11.105 --> 01:13.038
my full potential yet.
Well, obviously,
none of you have.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.506
No, I have. I'm a cop.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.209
And, as of yesterday,
my mom no longer buys

01:17.211 --> 01:19.344
my plane tickets, so...
(clicks tongue)

01:19.346 --> 01:21.113
You need a ten-year plan.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.215
Are you in a relationship
that's headed towards marriage?

01:23.217 --> 01:25.517
I am not currently,
but I did go on a date

01:25.519 --> 01:27.186
with somebody
named Charles last month.

01:27.188 --> 01:30.022
She was a woman, but she was
named after her uncle.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.256
Well, Winston has no game.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.058
Dude took a girl
to a cement plant.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.760
To see how rocks were made.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.261
That's not where rocks are made.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.564
And she loved it,
then she abruptly moved away.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.399
(groans)

01:40.401 --> 01:43.268
Work sucked, my friends.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.271
(nasally voice):
Hear ye, hear ye.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.075
Milady.

01:50.077 --> 01:54.246
I dub you Sir Winston
of the Roll of Egg.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.248
(nasally):
Ah, yes. Yes.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.484
Who are you in this story?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.619
I'm the jester.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.455
I'm not gonna
eat here anymore.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.431
You'd think that
the school board would want

02:12.433 --> 02:13.832
to give kids computers,
but no,

02:13.834 --> 02:15.567
they just want to get reelected

02:15.569 --> 02:18.270
so they can keep dressing
like Realtors from the 1980s.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.105
Solid municipal burn, Jessica.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.273
Fawn...
Councilwoman.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.175
Councilwoman-- do you think

02:23.177 --> 02:25.644
you could help me get
some traction with these people?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.779
Oh, funnily enough, I have
a charity event tomorrow

02:27.781 --> 02:29.581
with other high-powered
L.A. women.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.151
I'll put a word in with Yowtz.
Martha Yowtz?

02:32.153 --> 02:34.153
Yeah.
The lioness of
Los Angeles education?

02:34.155 --> 02:36.955
Yes.
The straw that stirs
the school board's drink?

02:36.957 --> 02:39.091
That's right.
That is a woman
I'd like to get to know.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.959
Is there any way I could come
with you to this event?

02:40.961 --> 02:44.129
Ah, you know, it's really
a networking thing.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.964
Well, that's perfect,
'cause I'd love to network her.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.633
<i>With</i> her. It's "with..."
You network<i> with</i> her.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.867
Yeah, it's
"network with her,"

02:48.869 --> 02:50.135
and you don't
really strike me

02:50.137 --> 02:51.603
as the "networking" type.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.472
You're more of a "follow
a butterfly around

02:53.474 --> 02:55.207
for a day" kind of gal.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.143
Oh, sister, I'm a middle-school
vice principal.

02:58.145 --> 03:01.180
You think I got this job
without knowing how to network?

03:01.182 --> 03:02.381
Most likely. Yes.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.116
I got an office
with a door, bub.

03:04.118 --> 03:05.951
Pencil me in.
I'll yak with Yowtz.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.486
The press will be there,

03:07.488 --> 03:10.822
and I could use a photo with
an educator, so... okay.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.191
Oh, great.
Oh. Hey.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.226
Do you still need me
for the photo op?

03:14.228 --> 03:15.994
I will need you
there, actually.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.697
I'm trying to become more
accessible on social media.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.567
Speaking of which, is
there some way you can

03:21.569 --> 03:24.703
make your skin look
less white in photos?

03:24.705 --> 03:27.139
People are saying that
you're haunting me.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.540
I can do that.
Absolutely. 100%.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.175
Let me just make a note.
Wonderful.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.511
And, Jess, the event tomorrow
is at a golf course.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.879
Do you golf?

03:33.881 --> 03:37.182
Does a bear eat with his hands?
(chuckles)

03:37.184 --> 03:38.417
I don't know.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.923
I'll be there.
Great.

03:44.925 --> 03:49.228
So I say to her, "Water?
I barely even know you."

03:49.230 --> 03:51.730
Stop talking to me like we're
in the middle of a conversation.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.332
We just sat down.
All right.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.367
I hate when you do that.
Okay.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.768
Winston.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.005
That is a beautiful
girl right there. Wow.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.907
Just say something to her.
Yeah, just say something to her.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.275
Shawty, what that thang do?

04:03.277 --> 04:05.010
No.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.845
What was that?
WINSTON: Dude, I think it's

04:06.847 --> 04:08.880
a nervous tic that stems from
my lack of self-confidence.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.782
We got to help.
I can't watch this.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.085
Excuse me, miss? Hi.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.220
Coach, stop.
Um, this is my
buddy, Winston.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.290
Um... I don't know what
he's doing with his mouth.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.092
That's not his
normal smile at all.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.761
I'm gonna fix that.
If I could just...

04:22.763 --> 04:24.196
Both sides-- even it out.

04:24.198 --> 04:25.697
Better.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.799
I think he likes you.
Oh, yeah?

04:27.801 --> 04:29.601
Just go talk to her. You got it.
I don't...

04:29.603 --> 04:31.937
Okay, okay, I'm going.
You got it. You got it.
He's coming.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.238
He's excited to talk to you.
Hey... My friends.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.374
(laughter)

04:36.543 --> 04:38.543
Hello.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.078
I'm Winston Bishop.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.547
Winston Bishop. KC.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.917
KC! Just be like,
"Yo, KC, where JoJo at?"

04:45.919 --> 04:46.885
(laughs)

04:46.887 --> 04:48.287
In rehab, probably.

04:48.289 --> 04:50.589
He's... he was on drugs.
Yeah.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.291
WINSTON:
Sorry. Um...

04:52.293 --> 04:54.393
I don't know what
to say right now.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.228
Uh, kind of
blowing this, huh?

04:56.230 --> 04:58.930
Uh...

04:58.932 --> 05:01.266
Um, I think you're
very beautiful, KC,

05:01.268 --> 05:04.603
and I would like to
see you again soon...

05:04.605 --> 05:08.073
like, later today for lunch?

05:08.075 --> 05:10.142
I'd love to.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.010
Really?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.345
Here.
Oh.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.013
I'm gonna put in my number...

05:15.015 --> 05:18.650
or come with me to this thing
in the park I'm going to now

05:18.652 --> 05:20.085
and we can grab something after.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.254
You know, I saw Nick Nolte
in the park once.

05:22.256 --> 05:24.856
And I was like, "Yo, Nick Nolte,
what you doing in the park?"

05:24.858 --> 05:26.925
And he was just like,
"I'm just hanging out."

05:26.927 --> 05:29.695
Yeah, so I thought
that was notable.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.698
I'm going to a rally
to protest the police.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.833
Do you want to come?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.368
Or we could just do lunch.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.203
Let's do lunch.
Okay.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.539
Yeah. Nice to...
nice to meet you, KC.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.947
CECE:
Fawn is none of my business,

05:48.949 --> 05:50.649
and Schmidt seems
to really like her,

05:50.651 --> 05:52.317
so whatever happens,
I'm just not getting involved.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.853
Then why are you on your way
to hang out with him?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.621
What are you doing?
He said to come over.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.623
He said it was an emergency.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.325
What if he does something sexy?

06:00.327 --> 06:01.393
That's like Gollum

06:01.395 --> 06:02.728
hanging out with the One Ring.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.096
It'll be fine.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.965
Ooh. Hey, Cece,
I'm glad you're here.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.134
I need you to put bronzer
all over my body.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.070
None of the guys are here,
and they also refused to do it.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.539
Um, all over.
I know you're giving me a look,

06:14.541 --> 06:15.907
but, really, like, all over.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.242
All the cracks,
the crevices.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.344
The engine, the caboose,
everything.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.613
Oh, okay.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.588
Gripped it and ripped it.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.889
You da man.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.591
No, say, "Fawn's the man."

06:32.593 --> 06:34.192
Fawn's the man.
Fawn's the man.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.894
Oh, hey, there's Yowtz.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.662
Woman's got more connections
than a flight

06:37.664 --> 06:39.030
from Burbank to Sri Lanka.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.399
Well, then, it's
a good thing

06:40.401 --> 06:41.833
I bought the
airport neck pillow

06:41.835 --> 06:44.069
in the gift shop,
because... (chuckles)

06:44.071 --> 06:45.670
You know what that means.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.539
I got this.
Okay.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.174
How the hell are you?

06:49.176 --> 06:50.509
Jessica Day.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.177
I need 20 computers
for my school.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.513
Just met you,
but noted.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.181
You're up.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.950
Thanks.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.452
What? Oh.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.354
You walk towards the...

07:09.930 --> 07:11.363
Whoops.

07:11.365 --> 07:13.131
Oh, dear Lord.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.736
Why are we putting
this on your body?

07:17.738 --> 07:19.371
Aren't you gonna be
wearing a shirt?

07:19.373 --> 07:20.572
Well, you know,
Fawn wants me

07:20.574 --> 07:21.807
to be prepared
for all scenarios.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.141
What if somebody
gives birth out there

07:23.143 --> 07:24.609
and I have to swaddle
the baby in my polo?

07:24.611 --> 07:26.311
(wry chuckle)
Yeah.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.313
I've never been under
this kind of scrutiny before.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.148
I'm having my teeth
shaved by

07:30.150 --> 07:31.783
a 25th of an inch.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.219
Fawn thinks that I have
the teeth of an immigrant.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.487
She says every time
she looks at me,

07:35.489 --> 07:37.289
all she can see is
Fievel Mouskewitz

07:37.291 --> 07:40.091
singing "There Are No Cats
in America."

07:40.093 --> 07:41.660
Those little...

07:41.662 --> 07:43.562
those little mice Jews.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.764
I mean, what do you think, Cece?

07:45.766 --> 07:47.165
You... you like Fawn, right?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.868
Yeah, I mean,
as-as long as you're happy.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.138
There you go.
What the hell?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.272
What?

07:54.274 --> 07:56.741
Why am I sparkly?

07:56.743 --> 07:57.909
Sparkly?

07:59.513 --> 08:01.246
You bought the bronzer
with glitter in it.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.447
Cece, please,
you gotta help me, Ce...

08:02.449 --> 08:04.015
Fawn's gonna kill me!

08:04.017 --> 08:05.750
Okay, just don't get
too expressive. You'll crease!

08:05.752 --> 08:07.586
So stupid! I feel like
I'm trying to get into

08:07.588 --> 08:09.154
an 18-and-under club
in Tucson!

08:09.156 --> 08:10.789
So, yeah, at the rally,
there was this kid

08:10.791 --> 08:11.857
I know from the
youth center

08:11.859 --> 08:12.958
who was arrested last week

08:12.960 --> 08:14.659
because he "fit a description."

08:14.661 --> 08:17.796
I mean, he's 14-- he doesn't
even fit into his jeans.

08:17.798 --> 08:18.830
(uncomfortable laughter)

08:18.832 --> 08:20.499
Yeah.
Anyways...

08:20.501 --> 08:22.968
enough about me. Let's,
uh, talk about you.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.603
What do you do?

08:24.605 --> 08:25.837
What do I do?

08:25.839 --> 08:26.972
Um... okay.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.274
Well... what do I do?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.609
Um...

08:30.611 --> 08:31.977
Okay, the truth is...

08:31.979 --> 08:33.812
Hey, man.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.647
You know them?

08:35.649 --> 08:38.550
Oh, not personally, no.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.318
Hey, what's up, Bishop?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.887
Oh, yeah, I do know them.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.488
We went to school together.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.856
See you at work, bud.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.057
More importantly...

08:46.059 --> 08:47.893
we work together.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.060
You're a cop?

08:49.062 --> 08:50.161
Me?
(laughs)

08:50.163 --> 08:51.463
A cop? No!

08:51.465 --> 08:52.898
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't...

08:52.900 --> 08:54.900
No, no, no.
Get that out of your head.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.068
Uh, what I do is I'm a...

08:57.070 --> 09:00.138
male stripper.
A stripper?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.706
That's why they were
wearing the uniforms.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.543
Yeah, I see where you...
why you would think that. No.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.412
A surprising amount of day work
for a stripper.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.681
You know, we just go in there,
we do our routine

09:09.683 --> 09:11.249
while they eat
their lunch salads.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.384
Wow.
(laughs)

09:12.386 --> 09:14.586
You just pray nobody
orders soup.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.355
Lost a lot of good men to soup.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.925
(short laugh)
It's hard to gauge temperature

09:19.927 --> 09:23.562
when you're just...
dipping and running.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.798
You'd be surprised what you
could replace a ladle with.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.506
Nice day.
Beautiful.

09:34.508 --> 09:37.609
What happened
to the top of my hat?

09:37.611 --> 09:38.843
You take it?

09:38.845 --> 09:40.612
(laughs)
A little, uh...

09:40.614 --> 09:41.947
little visor humor.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.348
Give me back my hat!

09:43.350 --> 09:44.549
I'm kidding.
(chuckles)

09:44.551 --> 09:46.251
I wasn't gonna hit you.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.519
I'm just joshing.

09:47.521 --> 09:50.322
Just Joshua, Joshua, joshing...

09:52.359 --> 09:54.259
Do you ladies want
to join my network?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.294
Uh, you ladies can just
go ahead and play through.
Yeah.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.430
Yeah.
I'll catch up with you later.

09:58.432 --> 10:02.033
Uh, so, how-how do you feel
that the networking is going?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.134
Pretty good.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.403
I would call it,
like, a solid B.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.738
It's a cruise ship disaster.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.607
Look, Jess, if you
want those computers,

10:08.609 --> 10:10.909
we have a lot of work to do
and not a lot of time to do it.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.043
Shake my hand.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.211
Gross.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.613
What is your name?

10:14.615 --> 10:15.814
Jess?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.115
You have the confidence
of a child

10:17.117 --> 10:18.617
that was raised in a basement.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.919
Say it with pride,
and include your job title

10:20.921 --> 10:22.621
like it's the second half
of your name.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.990
Like this--
Fawn Moscato, City Council.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.324
Jessica Day, Vice Principal!

10:26.326 --> 10:28.126
How the heck are you?

10:28.128 --> 10:29.928
DAWN:
<i>Lighten it up with a quick joke</i>
<i>whenever possible.</i>

10:29.930 --> 10:31.296
Nice shoes.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.931
Look like you chopped off
Big Bird's feet,

10:32.933 --> 10:34.966
you murderer.
(laughs)

10:34.968 --> 10:36.768
FAWN:
<i>And try not to make jokes</i>
<i>about murdering</i>

10:36.770 --> 10:38.737
Sesame Street<i> puppets</i>
<i>if you can.</i>

10:38.739 --> 10:40.572
JESS:<i> Good note.</i>
FAWN:<i> Now, tell me--</i>

10:40.574 --> 10:41.406
are you wearing underwear?

10:41.408 --> 10:43.508
Oh, yeah. Big-time.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.910
Lose them.
I never wear underwear

10:45.912 --> 10:47.445
in networking scenarios.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.514
Gives you a secret; an edge.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.849
Besides, I firmly believe

10:50.851 --> 10:53.318
that power emanates
from the vagina.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.153
So, why block it?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.989
It's not the only
thing that emanates.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.991
What does that mean?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.960
(quietly):
Other stuff.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.295
So I said, "Tammy,
are we playing golf,

11:04.297 --> 11:05.830
or are we making sand castles?"

11:05.832 --> 11:07.799
(laughter)

11:07.801 --> 11:09.634
Tammy is the worst.

11:09.636 --> 11:12.037
She told my kid to shut up once.
I nearly punched her.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.205
I don't want to start talking
business while we still

11:14.207 --> 11:15.940
have a whole tournament
to play, but...

11:15.942 --> 11:18.343
I'd love to connect about
your ideas in the clubhouse.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.145
Let's meet up there
when we're all done.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.713
Great. I'll see you
in there, Marty.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.214
May I call you Marty?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.349
Oh, I'd prefer it.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.617
(laughs)

11:25.619 --> 11:27.018
The clubhouse?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.620
That is where you
close the deal.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.221
You are in, my friend.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.023
Now, let's finish
up this game.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.125
No problem.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.176
Write a six and let's go.
They should start putting

11:51.178 --> 11:52.911
GPS in golf balls,
am I right?

11:52.913 --> 11:55.380
We already got lapped by Sue Kim

11:55.382 --> 11:58.550
from the Korean Women's League,
and she's 100.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.753
Jess, she is literally
100 years old.

12:01.755 --> 12:05.423
And I'm... I'll tell you what--
not a young 100.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.392
Martha doesn't strike me
as the type of person

12:07.394 --> 12:09.227
who gives computers
to cheaters.

12:09.229 --> 12:13.198
You really don't understand
how networking works.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.167
The computers are just
the thing you talk about

12:16.169 --> 12:18.069
when you're really talking about

12:18.071 --> 12:20.438
how to help each other
become more powerful.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.741
Just like the money
for this golf thing-- it doesn't

12:22.743 --> 12:25.944
go to charity. It just pays
for the event where we network.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.645
Isn't that cool?

12:28.749 --> 12:30.381
Yay, America!

12:30.383 --> 12:33.918
Were the computers
ever really on the table?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.553
You're still talking
about the computers?

12:35.555 --> 12:38.857
Okay. Uh, no. No.
No money for computers.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.959
I should've never listened
to you. I also should have

12:40.961 --> 12:43.428
never removed my underwear,
because now it's drafty

12:43.430 --> 12:45.630
and I feel vulnerable
to wildlife.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.132
Are your underwear sticking out
of your pocket?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.433
Are those boys' underwear?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.935
They're unisex.
None of your business.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.271
Look, will you forget the ball?
Or none of these women

12:53.273 --> 12:55.406
are ever going to invite you
to play golf again.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.476
Well, I don't want to play
golf with these women again.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.245
I don't want any part of this.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.546
If I can't have
the computers,

13:01.548 --> 13:03.481
I will...
I will stay here

13:03.483 --> 13:05.416
and I will play a
clean game of golf.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.620
Now, if you'll excuse me, Fawn,
I need to go find my ball.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.321
Like an honest person.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.489
Okay.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.324
Oh, look-- it's a baby bird.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.726
No, it's a dead baby bird.

13:14.728 --> 13:17.662
I need to move on
before I get emotional.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.430
Can't believe I didn't
tell her I was a cop.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.600
With everything that's
been going on, I just...

13:22.602 --> 13:24.235
I feel like she
wouldn't respect me.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.005
You want to know what I think?
No, Nick, I don't.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.840
This is something
you can't understand.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.109
Because I'm not black?
Uh...

13:31.111 --> 13:33.645
What, because I don't work for
NASA, I can't fix a rocket ship?

13:33.647 --> 13:35.613
If you don't work at
NASA, they're not gonna

13:35.615 --> 13:37.949
just let you walk off the
street and fix a rocket ship.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.984
You're missing my point.
Besides, you lost your
right to talk to me

13:39.986 --> 13:42.020
about race during
the O.J. trial.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.521
...is in the white Bronco...

13:43.523 --> 13:45.657
Why does it have to
be a "white" Bronco?

13:45.659 --> 13:48.459
Why not just a Bronco?

13:48.461 --> 13:49.994
I can talk to you about this.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.529
I mean, we grew up together.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.532
We went to the same schools,
we watched the same shows,

13:54.534 --> 13:56.034
we listened
to the same records.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.536
Your mother got a mouth
on the back of her neck,

13:58.538 --> 14:02.507
and bitch chew like this.
(grunts, laughs)

14:02.509 --> 14:04.776
Hercules.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.878
Was that your Eddie Murphy?
That's Eddie Murphy.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.013
That was so bad, it
wasn't even offensive.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.181
I said "Hercules,"
and everyone

14:10.183 --> 14:11.449
associates that
with Eddie Murphy.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.717
Whenever you do
your impressions,

14:12.719 --> 14:14.118
it makes me super
uncomfortable.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.553
Fine. You know what?
You want to do this?

14:15.555 --> 14:17.388
You and me are gonna
get weird about race?

14:17.390 --> 14:18.990
Do your Seinfeld.
Come... Nick, that's not...

14:18.992 --> 14:21.392
Do your Seinfeld.
What's the deal with bananas?

14:21.394 --> 14:23.294
I mean, they got
orange juice,

14:23.296 --> 14:26.531
you got apple juice,
where's the banana juice?

14:28.301 --> 14:29.868
(laughs):
I never thought of that.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.202
Ah, boy.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.805
'Cause you got orange juice,
you...

14:33.807 --> 14:37.408
I love you,
but you're white, I'm black.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.043
I understand
where she's coming from.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.546
When I was a kid,
we used to run from the police.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.048
Even if we did nothing wrong,
it was just out of habit.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.984
Why haven't you ever told me?

14:45.986 --> 14:48.653
COACH:
'Cause you'll never get it.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.889
How long have you
been standing there?

14:50.891 --> 14:52.924
Uh, right around, "Your mama
got a mouth on the back

14:52.926 --> 14:54.692
of her neck,
and the bitch chew like this."

14:54.694 --> 14:56.194
Now, that's Eddie!
I don't see the difference.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.996
(laughs):
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

14:57.998 --> 14:59.497
He's doing the laugh!
That's what I was doing.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.666
(imitating Eddie Murphy's laugh)

15:01.668 --> 15:03.067
Stop, Nick.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.769
I honestly don't
see the difference.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.337
As the only other black man
in this loft,

15:06.339 --> 15:07.538
I feel like I should weigh in.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.506
This issue

15:08.508 --> 15:09.841
really hits home with me,

15:09.843 --> 15:11.542
and I feel like
I have a lot of thoughts

15:11.544 --> 15:13.344
and ideas that I need
to get off my chest.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.879
Thank you, Coach.
But I'm hungry.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.447
Man.
I skipped breakfast,
and lunch

15:16.449 --> 15:17.615
is gonna be dumb as hell.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.450
¶ Race talk snacks ¶

15:19.452 --> 15:21.753
¶ Race talk snacks,
gotta get me ¶

15:21.755 --> 15:23.288
¶ Some race talk snacks ¶

15:23.290 --> 15:26.357
¶ Gonna be super
uncomfortable! ¶

15:26.359 --> 15:27.759
So, KC...
Shh...

15:27.761 --> 15:28.960
I just feel like...
Can't-can't weigh in.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.695
I know, but I...
Can't weigh in.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.697
I do have something I want
to say that's not a race...

15:32.699 --> 15:34.132
Shh, don't.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.300
I know what I'm gonna do.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.568
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.470
I'm a good guy;
that's all that matters.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.606
That's what I was gonna say.
I want to make this...
No, no, no.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.907
Shut it down, Nick.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.309
Your mother got a mouth

15:44.311 --> 15:46.377
on the back of her neck,
and she chews like this.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.879
Murphy, Murphy, Murphy.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.982
So the good news is
you can't see

15:50.984 --> 15:52.417
the glitter anymore.
Great.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.651
Well, what's the bad news?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.053
You look like,

15:55.055 --> 15:57.822
um... can't exactly
put my finger on it.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.162
I look like the dead body
the police pull out of a lake.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.230
That's how you describe it;
you look dead.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.565
I don't want to look like
a dead boy.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.900
I want to look like
a living boy.

16:08.902 --> 16:10.168
Why are you calling yourself
a boy?

16:10.170 --> 16:11.402
Because I'm freaking out!

16:11.404 --> 16:12.437
(phone chiming)
Freaking...

16:12.439 --> 16:13.671
Freaking out. Oh, no.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.007
It's-it's Fawn.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.743
(sighs)

16:18.745 --> 16:20.745
Hey, Faw... hey, Fawn.

16:20.747 --> 16:25.516
What the Jewish God
did you do?

16:25.518 --> 16:26.851
In an attempt to look
less ghost-like,

16:26.853 --> 16:28.419
I put on some bronzer,
but the bronzer

16:28.421 --> 16:29.787
had glitter in it, and now...

16:29.789 --> 16:32.423
You look like a wood carving
of yourself.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.659
The press is here.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.762
And single women have proven
to be less appealing to voters.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.831
Fix it and get here now.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.300
I am Fawn Moscato, and I will
not miss a photo opportunity!

16:42.302 --> 16:43.301
Faw... Oh.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.769
Fawn?

16:45.505 --> 16:46.471
How about a fake beard?

16:46.473 --> 16:47.538
Get some double-sided tape,

16:47.540 --> 16:49.007
we can shave Winston's cat...

16:49.009 --> 16:50.308
Okay, you know what, enough.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.642
I cannot just stand here
and watch Fawn

16:51.644 --> 16:53.111
treat you like
she's your pageant mom.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.146
She needs to accept you
exactly how you are,

16:55.148 --> 16:57.115
or you need to find
somebody that will.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.018
'Cause I think you
are fine as is.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.524
Damn it.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.226
You know what, you're right.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.962
Can you drive though? I want
to fix my makeup in the car.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.830
For me, not for her.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.999
I don't want to
scare anybody. Ugh.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.368
I think I'm drunk
from the face fumes.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.373
I've never seen
so many strokes taken

17:22.375 --> 17:24.342
on a single hole
in all of my life.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.244
This has got to be
some kind of record.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.545
Do you care to comment?

17:29.315 --> 17:30.815
Hey!

17:30.817 --> 17:32.750
Not bad! Look at her go!

17:32.752 --> 17:34.819
The hole's behind you.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.156
Thanks, Marty.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.361
172!

17:43.363 --> 17:46.197
Par was five.
I know, Marty.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.698
You're the worst golfer
I've ever seen.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.700
Look, I don't care
if I look stupid.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.369
I didn't come here
to climb the ladder.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.904
The only reason why I came here

17:52.906 --> 17:55.106
was to get computers
for my students.

17:55.108 --> 17:58.543
And that's the only reason
why I came: for the school.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.911
I respect that.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.679
I'll get you
those computers.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.514
Really?!
Yes, I will.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.884
In 2018, when the district
is fiscally solvent.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.487
I'll... take that as a victory.

18:13.059 --> 18:16.027
I support Vice Principal Day.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.762
It is education

18:17.764 --> 18:20.098
that will bring water
back to this city

18:20.100 --> 18:22.533
and will rebuild
the middle class...

18:22.535 --> 18:23.734
Don't let me
back down.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.203
Don't worry, I will not.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.138
You look...
so crazy right now.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.107
You look like a doll boy.
A doll man.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.741
I'm a d...
I'm a doll man.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.710
A doll man who's about
to get his dignity back.

18:32.712 --> 18:33.878
Let's beat China!

18:33.880 --> 18:36.047
I'm Fawn Moscato!
(chuckles)

18:36.049 --> 18:37.448
Oh!

18:38.485 --> 18:40.485
(crowd cheers)
Oh.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.153
(laughs):
I can't believe it.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.123
Now, this ball is a symbol...

18:45.125 --> 18:46.090
(crowd gasps)

18:46.092 --> 18:47.125
...of the unity...

18:47.127 --> 18:48.759
MAN:
Wow!

18:48.761 --> 18:50.461
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

18:50.463 --> 18:52.430
Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn,
Fawn, Fawn, Fawn.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.999
What? What's going on?
You're not wearing any, uh...

18:55.001 --> 18:57.034
Each one's like a snowflake.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.076
What do you mean there's a meme?

19:05.078 --> 19:06.677
It speaks?

19:06.679 --> 19:08.980
Well, what does it say?

19:08.982 --> 19:11.816
Oh, well, that is just crass.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.919
Yes, I know I wanted
a more accessible Web pr...

19:14.921 --> 19:16.854
Will you stop laughing, Lou?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.122
You're a father!

19:18.124 --> 19:20.424
You're<i> my</i> father!

19:21.261 --> 19:22.193
(gasps)

19:22.195 --> 19:23.427
Oh, no, no, it's...

19:23.429 --> 19:24.996
it's carpet cleaner.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.764
You know, I thought I'd take
it right down to the base.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.866
I'll probably have to regrow
some skin, but it's all right.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.668
It's okay, Schmidt.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.271
Look, I understand if you want
to break up with me.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.705
I'm a laughingstock,

19:34.707 --> 19:37.441
and you shouldn't be associated
with my brand.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.810
Which is tainted.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.345
An unfortunate choice of words.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.016
So, what was it you wanted
to say to me?

19:46.286 --> 19:49.153
Fawn, I don't want to
break up with you.

19:49.155 --> 19:52.123
I like you just the
way that you are.

19:54.694 --> 19:58.329
No offense, but you're
terrifying to look at,

19:58.331 --> 20:00.531
and you smell like
a chemical fire.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.667
Taint that the truth?

20:02.669 --> 20:04.902
Yeah.
Did you see what
I did there?

20:04.904 --> 20:07.205
I just...'Cause you did
it, then I...
It was too...
too soon. It's too soon.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.574
I wanted you to feel good
about when you said it though.
Okay.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.214
KC?

20:19.185 --> 20:20.518
So...

20:20.520 --> 20:24.455
um... this is the real me.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.392
I'm proud of what
I do, I really am.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.261
I work with a lot
of great people,

20:30.263 --> 20:32.330
and I want to be
one of them.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.098
Plus, if there are
ever Ghostbusters,

20:34.100 --> 20:36.634
I know they're gonna recruit
from law enforcement first.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.370
I know you're mad at me.

20:39.372 --> 20:42.773
I just came to say that.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.276
I'm not mad
that you're a cop.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.677
I'm mad that you lied.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.512
Well, tell you what,

20:48.514 --> 20:52.016
uh, is there any way I
could take you out again

20:52.018 --> 20:54.418
and, you know, uh,
be so honest with you

20:54.420 --> 20:56.520
that it scares the
hell out of you?

20:56.522 --> 20:59.357
I don't know.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.361
That uniform is kind of
distracting, isn't it?

21:04.264 --> 21:07.198
Maybe you should... take it off.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.803
(laughs)

21:12.805 --> 21:14.538
You lied and said
you were a stripper;

21:14.540 --> 21:16.374
it seems like
the fair thing to do.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.642
(dance music playing)

21:17.644 --> 21:19.076
Just in front of
all these people?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.811
In front of
your colleagues?
(man whoops)

21:20.813 --> 21:22.480
Oh, okay. I hear
some "whoos!"

21:22.482 --> 21:23.814
(whoops)

21:23.816 --> 21:25.483
You ain't got
no Ginuwine or nothing?

21:25.485 --> 21:28.286
Seriously though,
I'm... I'm...

21:28.288 --> 21:30.154
I really am a police officer.
It's...

21:30.156 --> 21:32.890
I can't really be here
stripping for... you!

21:32.892 --> 21:34.158
(whoops)

21:34.160 --> 21:36.260
It's a clip-on, ladies.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.296
And it's on the ground.
Here we go.

21:38.298 --> 21:41.832
Uh-huh, I want y'all to
get y'all ones ready.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.934
I wear my underwear
two sizes too big.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.469
(laughing)

21:45.471 --> 21:46.570
(grunts, mutters)

21:46.572 --> 21:48.272
This is a... this is a thing.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.808
This is a thing I got to do
in order to get my belt off.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.077
