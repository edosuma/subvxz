Yes.

If Callie decides that she
does not want to be adopted

00:07.853 --> 00:09.660
do you want to be adopted without her?

00:09.667 --> 00:11.634
I am getting adopted, with or without you.

00:11.669 --> 00:13.595
Well, I think you need to have
a conversation with Callie.

00:13.596 --> 00:14.726
She's trying to get her own appartment.

00:14.738 --> 00:16.706
You think she's doing this
so she can be with Brandon?

00:16.740 --> 00:18.808
You locked me in a room with some man

00:18.842 --> 00:21.477
who proceeded to tell me
that being gay was a sin.

00:21.512 --> 00:24.647
Well, I was being a parent. I was
pushing you in the right direction.

- How's the game?

00:44.623 --> 00:47.859
We're getting killed.

00:47.893 --> 00:51.663
Do you remember when we went to
see the Padres in Chicago that time?

00:51.697 --> 00:53.565
You were, I don't know,
maybe six or seven...

00:53.599 --> 00:56.434
How can I forget. That was
my first away game, right?

00:56.468 --> 00:58.436

What's so funny? What's so funny?"

01:11.684 --> 01:15.587
Yeah, well, how was I supposed to
know? You and Mom were laughing at me.

01:15.621 --> 01:17.655
It was a little rude, I think.

service was just beautiful.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.790
And the eulogy the Pastor gave was perfect.

Oh, yeah, he sure does
wax poetical, doesn't he?

12:24.060 --> 12:27.029
You should have heard the eulogy he
gave for my sexuality when I was 16.

12:27.063 --> 12:28.063
What?

12:30.066 --> 12:33.035
Yeah, that was the guy Dad sent me to when
he caught me cuddling on the couch with Tess.

12:33.069 --> 12:35.037
- He is?
- Mm-hm.

12:35.071 --> 12:38.140
Then why on earth did you
ask him to do the eulogy?

12:38.174 --> 12:41.977
[sighs] Because he was Dad's minister
and that's what Dad would've wanted.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.712
I'm surprised he came.

12:43.747 --> 12:46.882
I never thought he would dare
enter the House of the Damned.

12:54.824 --> 12:59.094
So I... I think maybe we should tell
my moms that, you know, we're together.

reason to hide anymore, right?

14:33.857 --> 14:35.758
See you in the morning.

14:51.650 --> 14:54.200
Isn't it a little... dark?

14:54.231 --> 14:56.613
It was Dad's favorite.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.848
Why couldn't his favorite
have been cotton candy?

14:58.883 --> 15:00.884
- [chuckles]
- You can't be sad when there's cotton candy.

15:00.918 --> 15:03.687
He used to tell everyone

15:03.721 --> 15:06.489
that black licorice was the only
candy he could have in the house

15:06.524 --> 15:08.892
that I wouldn't steal.

15:08.926 --> 15:10.760
Now I love it.

15:10.795 --> 15:11.928
It's good. You should try some.

15:16.601 --> 15:17.667
- Mmm.
- Right?

15:17.702 --> 15:19.903
- Not bad.
- Not bad.

15:19.937 --> 15:22.672
- [baby cooing]
- Peek-a-boo.

15:22.707 --> 15:25.709
- [baby giggles]
- Thanks, hon.

15:30.581 --> 15:33.583
Oh, my God. It's like evil in my mouth.

15:33.618 --> 15:35.952
- [doorbell rings]
- [groans]

15:42.526 --> 15:43.827
- Hello?
- Hi. I'm...

15:43.861 --> 15:45.795
Emma, hi. Come in.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.733
This is my sister, Mariana.

15:50.768 --> 15:52.702
This is Emma.

15:52.737 --> 15:53.937
Emma's on the wrestling team with me.

15:53.971 --> 15:57.607
Oh, ok, so you're the crazy girl.

15:59.510 --> 16:01.778
I only mean crazy 'cause you're
wrestling with all those boys,

16:01.812 --> 16:03.546
not 'cause you're actually crazy.

16:03.581 --> 16:04.581
Mariana, walk away.

16:06.951 --> 16:08.551
Hi.

16:09.820 --> 16:11.454
I know this is kind of...

16:12.723 --> 16:14.791
I told my mom about your grampa

16:14.825 --> 16:17.727
and she made me bring food.

16:17.762 --> 16:19.896
We're Jews, it's what we do.

16:19.930 --> 16:22.766
It's noodle kugel. It's totally delicious.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.702
And it's organic so, you know,
totally dye-free and everything.

16:25.736 --> 16:27.637
You really didn't have to do this.

16:27.672 --> 16:28.838
Try telling my mom that.

16:28.873 --> 16:31.608
Do you want me to take your coat?

16:31.642 --> 16:32.642
[Emma] Ok.

16:37.848 --> 16:39.749
Is there something you
want to tell me about?

16:41.519 --> 16:43.720
- Mike told you?
- Mike?

16:43.754 --> 16:45.722
About the article? He
said he didn't want to...

16:45.756 --> 16:46.723
What article?

16:47.925 --> 16:49.559
[sighs]

16:49.593 --> 16:50.794
Lena?

16:52.663 --> 16:54.864
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Stef, come on...

16:54.899 --> 16:57.467
What did this article say?

16:57.501 --> 16:58.702
It was about police brutality,

16:58.736 --> 17:01.538
just the whole last section
was about me, and the shooting.

17:01.572 --> 17:03.473
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

17:03.507 --> 17:06.542
They make Ana's boyfriend
out to be some sort of saint,

17:06.577 --> 17:08.877
and me some overzealous
cop with a vendetta.

17:08.913 --> 17:11.548
They basically accuse
me of murdering the guy.

17:11.582 --> 17:14.617
I'm really sorry, Mike. I
don't... can I do anything?

17:14.652 --> 17:17.820
No, look, all I know is I was supposed
to be going back to work next week

17:17.855 --> 17:20.457
and now they're not gonna let me.

18:08.873 --> 18:13.576
Ok, I've got the refills of
the pistachios and meatballs.

18:14.812 --> 18:16.846
Hey, um, have you seen Jude?

18:16.881 --> 18:20.917
Uh, he was out back a little bit ago but...

18:20.951 --> 18:22.919
Ok.

18:24.955 --> 18:26.790
Do you need any help?

18:28.926 --> 18:31.461
Yeah, actually, you could
take this to the buffet for me.

18:31.495 --> 18:32.595
Yeah.

18:42.673 --> 18:44.607
- Hello, my love?
- Hey.

18:44.642 --> 18:45.909
What's the matter?

18:47.511 --> 18:48.711
Nothing. Nothing.

18:48.746 --> 18:50.680
It's just Frank and...

18:50.714 --> 18:52.849
I just never realized
you two were that close.

18:52.883 --> 18:54.551
No, we really weren't.

18:54.585 --> 18:56.686
I mean, he had his lovable qualities but...

18:57.788 --> 19:00.790
more than that, it's Callie is here.

19:00.825 --> 19:02.792
You know, she's being so sweet, so kind.

19:02.827 --> 19:06.696
I just don't understand what she's thinking
with this whole getting-her-own-apartment thing.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.898
It's completely baffling.

19:08.933 --> 19:11.668
I know.

19:11.702 --> 19:13.603
It's something else.

19:13.637 --> 19:14.871
Lena Elizabeth, what's going on?

19:21.612 --> 19:23.546
Sit.

19:25.883 --> 19:28.585
Ok, you can't say anything.
Stef would kill me.

19:28.619 --> 19:30.920
All right, but lately,

19:30.955 --> 19:33.556
I have been thinking a lot

19:33.591 --> 19:37.460
about the fact that... I never had a baby.

19:37.494 --> 19:38.862
- Really?
- Yes.

19:38.896 --> 19:43.833
And I did this insane thing at the ob-gyn

19:43.868 --> 19:47.537
and had her test my levels and...

19:47.571 --> 19:50.807
everything's good, so
technically, I could still...

19:50.841 --> 19:52.508
Oh, honey.

19:53.878 --> 19:55.745
Why are you doing this to yourself?

19:55.779 --> 19:59.816
You only feel this way because you
feel like your clock is running out.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.918
Stop torturing yourself.
You don't want a baby.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.921
If you did you'd have one by now.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.523
[chuckling]

20:11.161 --> 20:13.129
- [Connor] You're moving it.
- [Jude] I swear, I'm not!

20:13.163 --> 20:15.365
Come on, you guys, someone
is definitely moving this.

20:15.399 --> 20:17.400
This can't be real.

20:17.434 --> 20:21.137
We need to ask like a test question,
something nobody knows the answer to.

20:21.171 --> 20:23.106
Ok, I've got one.

20:24.274 --> 20:26.342
Will I ever have a boyfriend?

20:34.351 --> 20:36.285
- Now who's moving it?
- [Connor laughs]

20:36.320 --> 20:39.255
OK, wait, I've gotta know who.

20:39.323 --> 20:43.226
[sighs] What is the name
of my first boyfriend?

20:48.132 --> 20:49.465
[Connor] Who's Z?

20:53.370 --> 20:55.371
Zac.

20:55.406 --> 20:58.007
Ok, you know what, I'm good.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.375
This is just a silly board game.

20:59.410 --> 21:01.344
You two "communicate with the
spirit world" all you want,

21:01.378 --> 21:03.146
I'm done.

21:06.283 --> 21:09.419
[indistinct chatter]

21:11.221 --> 21:12.422
Hey, babe, what are you doing?

21:14.158 --> 21:15.425
Stef, if you are reading that article,

21:15.459 --> 21:17.427
please don't do that now.
It's just gonna make you upset.

21:17.461 --> 21:20.163
I'm already upset, Lena,
so let it be, please.

21:22.232 --> 21:24.267
[sighs]

21:30.407 --> 21:32.141
Well...

21:34.344 --> 21:36.345
That was...

21:36.380 --> 21:38.414
something.

21:40.384 --> 21:44.220
Are you mad at her? You've
been short with her all day.

21:44.254 --> 21:48.124
I think Lena is trying to get
pregnant. Or thinking about it, anyway.

21:48.158 --> 21:52.061
Now, with all you have going on?

21:52.095 --> 21:53.329
I think so.

21:53.363 --> 21:56.966
I mean but... how?

22:00.070 --> 22:03.005
- Is she having an affair?
- No, Mom!

22:05.242 --> 22:09.245
And what's worse is, she's
not talking to me about it.

22:09.279 --> 22:13.216
Well, if she won't come
to you, sweetheart...

22:13.250 --> 22:14.951
you gotta go to her.

22:14.985 --> 22:19.088
What am I supposed to say,
Mom? We can't have a baby.

22:25.429 --> 22:28.097
So what's up with you and Callie?

22:28.131 --> 22:30.266
Are you guys like a couple now?

22:32.035 --> 22:34.303
Is that why she's getting her
own apartment and everything?

22:36.073 --> 22:39.008
Uh, no. No.

22:39.042 --> 22:40.443
- No, she just wants to be on her own.
- You sure about that?

22:47.417 --> 22:50.086
Well aren't you a love for helping out.

22:53.223 --> 22:55.258
Sweetheart, forgive my candor, but...

22:55.292 --> 22:58.060
I understand that you've decided

22:58.095 --> 23:00.363
that you don't want to be adopted anymore.

23:02.399 --> 23:05.334
Well, yeah. I'm 16.

23:05.369 --> 23:08.237
I don't need to be adopted.

23:08.272 --> 23:11.007
Family isn't just until
you're 18, you know.

23:12.242 --> 23:14.210
You need them your whole life.

23:15.312 --> 23:18.014
Especially at times like these.

23:33.130 --> 23:36.065
No, no, no, don't knot that.

23:36.099 --> 23:39.268
- You'll never get that out.
- No, Mom.

23:39.303 --> 23:41.203
No!

23:41.238 --> 23:43.005
You don't get to do that anymore.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.975
I love you and you're my mother,

23:46.009 --> 23:51.013
but your experience is yours
and my experience is mine.

23:51.048 --> 23:53.382
I am no longer interested in hearing
what you have to say about it,

23:53.417 --> 23:55.318
unless it's, "I love you and I understand."

24:00.157 --> 24:02.158
Well...

24:07.030 --> 24:11.000
I didn't realize I was
doing that. I apologize.

24:12.336 --> 24:16.405
I never... I never meant to
take anything away from you.

24:19.409 --> 24:22.345
I'm very proud of you, for saying all that.

24:25.148 --> 24:26.382
I just don't know why it took you so long.

24:26.416 --> 24:29.986
[sniffling]

24:30.020 --> 24:32.154
[sighs] You just can't
help yourself, can you?

24:32.189 --> 24:34.256
What do you want from me? [chuckles]

24:38.095 --> 24:40.162
Well, since now we're being totally honest,

24:40.197 --> 24:43.065
isn't there something that
you need to say to your wife?

24:45.268 --> 24:47.970
Something about a baby?

24:50.140 --> 24:53.442
- [cheering on video game]
- Oh, my God, you suck!

24:53.477 --> 24:55.077
[chuckles]

24:55.112 --> 24:59.048
[beeping]

24:59.082 --> 25:01.183
- Are you gonna get that?
- No, I'll call her later.

25:03.286 --> 25:06.255
Hey, what are you...? Hey.

25:06.289 --> 25:09.125
<i>Hey, I was just calling to
see how the funeral went.</i>

25:09.159 --> 25:11.360
<i>Uh, sorry,</i>

25:11.395 --> 25:13.963
<i>I didn't know you had company.</i>

25:13.997 --> 25:17.199
<i>- Who's this?
- Hi, I'm Emma.</i>

25:17.234 --> 25:20.069
<i>Oh. Wow. Hi.</i>

25:20.103 --> 25:22.972
<i>Jesus told me that there was
a girl on the wrestling team.</i>

25:23.006 --> 25:26.242
<i>But you are not what I was expecting.</i>

25:26.276 --> 25:29.145
I get that a lot. People
think to be a wrestler

25:29.179 --> 25:31.414
you have to be built like
a mac truck or something.

25:31.448 --> 25:35.184
<i>No, I mean, I didn't...</i>

25:35.218 --> 25:37.186
<i>Yeah, I guess that is what I was thinking.</i>

25:37.220 --> 25:40.289
[laughter]

25:42.993 --> 25:46.228
"To"? What does that mean?

25:49.466 --> 25:51.967
"Toy"?

25:52.002 --> 25:55.104
Do you think they're trying to tell
us that the Ouija board is just a toy?

25:55.138 --> 25:57.273
- And that we shouldn't play with it?
- No, I don't think so.

25:57.307 --> 26:00.342
Oh my God! Frank just gave us a new Toyota.

26:00.377 --> 26:02.311
He got you a new car?

26:02.345 --> 26:05.214
- Stef is making us give it away.
- Why?

26:07.984 --> 26:09.919
Maybe he wants us to keep it.

26:11.021 --> 26:12.288
You didn't push it?

26:15.192 --> 26:16.992
Can we do one more?

26:17.027 --> 26:18.928
Yeah, sure.

26:23.433 --> 26:27.069
Mom. Are you there?

26:39.082 --> 26:42.017
Mom...

26:42.052 --> 26:44.220
is it ok if Stef and Lena adopt me?

27:09.800 --> 27:12.709
And now, for la pièce de résistance.

27:14.987 --> 27:17.022
- Are you kidding me?
- What's the matter?

27:17.056 --> 27:20.192
These are Dodger cupcakes, they're
supposed to be Padres cupcakes.

27:20.226 --> 27:23.028
Oh, my... I didn't check the box before...

27:23.062 --> 27:24.963
My dad hated the Dodgers.
This is ridiculous.

27:24.997 --> 27:26.064
I'll just go pick up some plain ones.

27:26.099 --> 27:28.967
You know what? They're
cupcakes. This is stupid.

27:29.001 --> 27:30.202
I'll just put them out like this.

27:30.236 --> 27:32.270
Go Padres!

27:34.841 --> 27:37.275
Callie, what's wrong?

27:37.310 --> 27:38.844
My necklace.

27:40.179 --> 27:42.147
I lost my necklace.

27:43.983 --> 27:47.919
Um... I guess the clasp must've broken.

27:47.954 --> 27:50.255
The little gold coin thingie?
Were you wearing it today?

27:50.289 --> 27:51.857
I wear it every day.

27:51.891 --> 27:53.258
Stay calm and retrace your steps.

27:53.292 --> 27:55.961
I've been all over the house, the backyard.

27:55.995 --> 27:58.997
- When did you last see it?
- Um, I don't know, this afternoon, I think.

27:59.031 --> 28:02.968
- It'll be ok, we'll find it.
- I lost my wedding ring once in the trash.

28:03.002 --> 28:05.804
[chuckling] That was a day
to remember, I'll tell you.

28:05.838 --> 28:07.105
What's going on?

28:07.140 --> 28:08.807
Uh, Callie misplaced her necklace.

28:08.841 --> 28:11.209
I didn't misplace it,
ok, I lost it! I'm stupid.

28:11.244 --> 28:13.178
Callie, honey,

28:13.212 --> 28:15.814
I'm sorry, but if you lost
it we can just replace it.

28:15.848 --> 28:18.850
Please don't! Just leave me alone please.

28:23.956 --> 28:25.257
It was our mom's necklace.

28:31.197 --> 28:34.166
- Callie, it's ok.
- It's not.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.168
Callie, you're freaking me out.

28:36.202 --> 28:39.204
You're acting like you did
when we found out that Mom died.

28:39.238 --> 28:41.006
What are you talking about?

28:41.040 --> 28:42.274
When you destroyed your room.

28:48.881 --> 28:51.116
That was you, Jude.

28:51.150 --> 28:53.985
[exhales deeply] You destroyed my room.

28:55.121 --> 28:56.154
No, Callie.

28:57.256 --> 28:59.124
It was you.

29:16.175 --> 29:18.977
- Oh, my God.
- [door opens]

29:21.147 --> 29:23.849
[door closes]

29:23.883 --> 29:27.052
Jude, can I have a
minute with Callie please.

29:32.124 --> 29:34.960
Lena was only trying to help, you know.

29:34.994 --> 29:36.828
I know, I'm sorry.

29:36.863 --> 29:39.264
Honey, that necklace is not your mom.

29:39.298 --> 29:41.199
I know that it's important to you.

29:41.234 --> 29:42.801
It's the only thing of her I have left.

29:42.835 --> 29:44.836
No, it's not, honey.

29:44.871 --> 29:47.272
You have her and all those memories.

29:47.306 --> 29:49.941
And those are never gonna get lost.

29:56.282 --> 29:58.049
Sit down, have a seat.

29:58.084 --> 30:00.051
Talk to me.

30:02.121 --> 30:06.157
You know, you have... you've never
said one word about her, your mom.

30:06.192 --> 30:08.193
Tell me about this woman who created...

30:09.996 --> 30:13.098
the amazing girl sitting
in front of me, please.

30:15.935 --> 30:19.104
[whimpering] I didn't kiss her goodbye.

30:19.138 --> 30:20.906
You what?

30:20.940 --> 30:22.240
And...

30:22.275 --> 30:24.142
I nev...

30:25.978 --> 30:27.846
the night she died, I didn't.

30:28.915 --> 30:30.048
Oh, Callie.

30:31.350 --> 30:33.985
[sobbing] I should've kissed her goodbye.

30:34.020 --> 30:36.922
Baby. Oh, honey.

30:36.956 --> 30:39.190
Let it go.

30:46.299 --> 30:49.901
You know, the last thing I said to my dad

30:49.936 --> 30:53.204
was to pretty much take
the car and shove it.

31:02.915 --> 31:04.249
It's hard to lose someone you love

31:04.283 --> 31:08.219
and you never ever want
to feel that pain again.

31:08.254 --> 31:10.221
Now the problem with that is,

31:10.256 --> 31:14.059
the only way to make
sure that doesn't happen

31:14.093 --> 31:16.861
is you shut yourself off.

31:18.097 --> 31:21.900
And you stop loving. That's no way to live.

31:24.937 --> 31:28.206
I know it's scary to open
yourself back up again.

31:29.942 --> 31:32.844
Do you know that most of the time...

31:32.878 --> 31:36.147
I feel like I have five separate
hearts, running around outside of me.

31:41.087 --> 31:42.887
It's you kids.

32:13.986 --> 32:16.888
Thanks for making that koodle
or whatever you call it.

32:16.922 --> 32:20.925
Kugel. And you're welcome, even
though you didn't even try it.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.293
I promise, when I get back
inside I'm gonna try it.

32:25.297 --> 32:27.932
It was nice meeting all your family.

32:27.967 --> 32:29.300
Now I know why you're so bizarre.

32:29.335 --> 32:31.970
Really? Says the girl
who's on the wrestling team.

32:35.107 --> 32:37.042
Lexi seems nice.

32:37.076 --> 32:38.309
Yeah, she's great.

32:41.981 --> 32:44.916
So... is she coming back?

32:46.018 --> 32:48.853
I mean, how long is she
gonna be in Honduras?

32:50.256 --> 32:51.222
I don't know.

32:59.265 --> 33:02.167
I'll... I'll see you at practice tomorrow?

33:04.070 --> 33:05.070
Ok.

33:05.104 --> 33:06.805
Um...

33:06.839 --> 33:09.908
Thanks for letting me crash your funeral.

33:11.210 --> 33:12.811
Bye.

33:21.287 --> 33:24.189
Well, I think it's time I took my leave.

33:24.223 --> 33:27.926
Thank you very much.
You have a lovely home.

33:27.960 --> 33:28.927
Thank you.

33:28.961 --> 33:30.195
Um...

33:32.198 --> 33:34.099
You know, to be honest,
I'm surprised you came.

33:36.135 --> 33:40.972
Well, people's attitudes evolve, Stef.

33:41.006 --> 33:42.907
Even your father.

33:42.942 --> 33:45.243
He came to me very often,
trying to reconcile his faith

33:45.277 --> 33:47.979
with... your lifestyle.

33:48.013 --> 33:50.148
It was very difficult for him.

33:52.952 --> 33:54.319
So am I supposed to be happy about that?

33:54.353 --> 33:59.023
That your father was questioning
his fundamental beliefs

33:59.058 --> 34:00.792
because of his love for you?

34:03.229 --> 34:05.263
Yes.

34:05.297 --> 34:07.932
I should think that would make you happy.

34:12.103 --> 34:15.139
Well, I should get home. Thank you so much.

34:15.174 --> 34:19.177
Frank was very important to
me, and to all of us at church.

34:20.279 --> 34:25.216
And you have a beautiful family.

34:27.052 --> 34:28.253
Yeah.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.862
<i>Hi, captain.</i>

34:39.896 --> 34:41.831
I'm sorry. Am I too late?

34:41.864 --> 34:44.800
- No, no, no.
- I had to go down to the station.

34:44.835 --> 34:47.002
It's fine. Why don't you grab
some dessert or something, ok?

34:47.036 --> 34:48.804
Ok.

34:53.844 --> 34:55.177
Hey, Mike.

34:55.212 --> 34:56.911
Captain.

34:58.982 --> 35:02.151
So I got a courtesy call
from the DA's office.

35:02.185 --> 35:06.055
That article in the paper today
has really stirred the pot.

35:06.089 --> 35:09.024
There's been a ton of public outcry...

35:09.059 --> 35:13.829
Um... Well, look, he's decided to start an
investigation, to see if he can press charges.

35:13.864 --> 35:16.065
- What?
- We're gonna do everything we can,

35:16.099 --> 35:18.200
and the union will make
sure to provide you with...

35:18.235 --> 35:20.803
Provide a lawyer if I need one?

35:20.837 --> 35:23.072
God! This is unbelievable!

35:23.106 --> 35:25.207
I thought this was supposed to go away.

35:25.242 --> 35:27.209
I was supposed to go back to work.

35:27.244 --> 35:29.778
Now what? I could end up going to jail?

35:29.813 --> 35:31.180
Not if I have anything to say about it.

35:31.214 --> 35:34.850
The problem is, you don't, captain.

35:43.226 --> 35:45.027
[clears throat]

35:51.168 --> 35:53.169
[gasps] You found it?

35:55.805 --> 35:57.072
Yeah.

36:05.015 --> 36:07.183
You're my hero.

36:14.925 --> 36:16.959
I love you, Brandon.

36:18.028 --> 36:20.129
I love you, too.

36:20.163 --> 36:23.065
[folk music]

36:23.099 --> 36:24.900
But...

36:25.869 --> 36:27.937
I know.

36:27.971 --> 36:32.041
<i>♪ I'll leave you ♪
♪ Leave you this way ♪</i>

36:33.910 --> 36:35.744
I know.

36:40.116 --> 36:41.984
I need a family.

36:43.053 --> 36:46.021
And this, you, all of you,

36:46.056 --> 36:48.090
you are my family.

36:50.994 --> 36:56.165
So I don't think that
we can do this anymore.

36:56.199 --> 36:58.167
You know?

37:02.172 --> 37:05.040
I never realized until today

37:05.075 --> 37:10.012
that for us to be together,
you have to give up everything.

37:11.147 --> 37:13.816
And that's not really fair of me to ask.

37:32.235 --> 37:34.136
[Sharon] Brandon?

37:35.839 --> 37:37.973
Uh, yeah, Grandma.

37:38.008 --> 37:40.175
I was wondering if you might come
in and play a little something?

37:40.210 --> 37:42.945
It's so quiet in there,
you'd think it was a funeral.

37:42.979 --> 37:44.980
Yeah. Sure.

37:47.784 --> 37:49.184
- What are you wearing?
- Oh.

37:49.219 --> 37:53.055
[chuckles] It's Frank's. I was cold.

37:53.089 --> 37:55.858
I kinda wanted him to be buried in it.

37:55.892 --> 37:58.994
But I'm glad we didn't. I
think I'll keep it though.

38:00.930 --> 38:04.867
He was wearing this the last
time he told me he loved me.

38:06.970 --> 38:09.705
So you gonna come in and play a
little something for ol' Frank?

38:09.739 --> 38:11.073
Yeah.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.747
What about you, Callie, you coming?

38:18.782 --> 38:22.084
Uh, I think I'm just gonna...

38:22.118 --> 38:24.186
stay out here a minute, if it's ok.

38:24.220 --> 38:27.022
Sure. You all right, doll?

38:29.059 --> 38:30.726
I am.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.000
[door closes]

38:39.102 --> 38:41.837
- [sighs]
- [door opens, closes]

38:43.807 --> 38:44.807
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:44.841 --> 38:46.141
Hey.

38:46.176 --> 38:49.978
- You found Mom's necklace?
- Yeah.

38:54.784 --> 38:56.685
I'm coming home, Jude.

38:58.988 --> 39:01.023
I wanna come home.

39:01.057 --> 39:04.927
[woman] I need you kids to pack a bag.

39:04.961 --> 39:07.129
We're gonna take you to
stay with a very nice family

39:07.163 --> 39:09.098
called the Segals for a little while.

39:09.132 --> 39:11.066
What about our dad?

39:12.969 --> 39:15.871
Your dad is in jail.

39:15.905 --> 39:18.774
He was drinking before the accident,

39:18.808 --> 39:22.911
and several people, including
your mom, were killed.

39:22.946 --> 39:25.687
You're not gonna split us up, are you?

39:25.688 --> 39:27.651
'Cause I won't leave my brother.

39:28.785 --> 39:31.754
We're not gonna separate you, I promise.

39:31.788 --> 39:35.791
We're gonna keep you together until
we can find a home for you both.

39:38.194 --> 39:40.729
[piano jazz music]

39:41.231 --> 39:43.098
[chuckling]

40:28.178 --> 40:30.078
Where's Mom?

40:30.113 --> 40:32.080
I think she went out front.

40:34.117 --> 40:36.051
[music continues]

40:38.822 --> 40:43.091
Thank you for the car, Dad.
It's gonna be a lifesaver.

40:46.162 --> 40:50.899
I can't believe I'm saying this but
I'm gonna miss the hell out of you.

40:50.934 --> 40:53.802
I know you did the best that you could,

40:53.837 --> 40:55.771
best way you knew how.

41:00.977 --> 41:05.013
And I want you to know that I forgive you.

41:10.019 --> 41:12.020
I love you, Daddy.

41:12.989 --> 41:14.756
[chuckles quietly]

41:18.228 --> 41:20.162
[chuckles]

41:21.965 --> 41:23.966
Go Padres.

41:32.108 --> 41:34.142
[chuckles]

42:11.180 --> 42:13.749
- [Lena] It's snowing.
- Yeah.

42:24.794 --> 42:26.028
So...

42:27.797 --> 42:29.965
Do you wanna have a baby?
