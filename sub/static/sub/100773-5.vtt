00:04.178 --> 00:06.011
[Senior] Previously
on  Billions...

00:06.095 --> 00:08.637
You know why I can see
Yonkers' future?

00:08.720 --> 00:10.011
[Axe] 'Cause I can
see its past.

00:10.095 --> 00:13.136
Mike Prince
is Axe's real enemy.

00:13.220 --> 00:16.303
You know the house he
lives in now was my house.

00:16.387 --> 00:17.637
Come on back,
and have dinner with us.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.887
I'll make meatloaf.

00:18.970 --> 00:21.345
Can't wait.
Dinner at home in my hometown.

00:21.428 --> 00:23.720
Only I'm not gonna allow you
to do any work.

00:23.804 --> 00:25.220
I'm gonna bring my chef.

00:25.303 --> 00:27.970
We should do it-- Turn Mase Cap
into an impact fund.

00:28.053 --> 00:29.804
Together. Within Axe Cap.
But ours.

00:29.887 --> 00:31.261
Yes.

00:31.345 --> 00:32.637
[Walker] We were
thrilled to hear

00:32.720 --> 00:34.303
[Walker] that you
might be interested

00:34.387 --> 00:36.303
[Walker] in teaching here at
the Law School this semester.

00:36.387 --> 00:38.178
Professor Rhoades.

00:38.261 --> 00:40.178
Oh, I know--
Catherine Brant.

00:40.261 --> 00:41.929
I heard
you were up here.

00:42.011 --> 00:44.970
You know my new artist--Tanner--
I got working on commission.

00:45.053 --> 00:45.929
-[Wendy] Yeah.
-[Axe] He's not working.

00:46.011 --> 00:47.595
You're on the precipice

00:47.679 --> 00:50.053
of the kind of success
very few artists ever have.

00:50.136 --> 00:51.428
Look.

00:51.512 --> 00:52.720
There we go.

00:52.804 --> 00:54.512
You'll be the first
to see it when it's done.

00:54.595 --> 00:55.845
I better be.

00:55.929 --> 00:57.887
I'm fine with you
winning in Yonkers.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.553
[Prince] Yonkers  is  you.

00:59.637 --> 01:02.345
[Prince] You are Yonkers.
You've never really left.

01:02.428 --> 01:04.261
[Prince] You stink
of the place.

01:04.345 --> 01:05.887
[Prince] And now you're
back in it.

01:05.970 --> 01:08.387
I've gotta get the fuck out
of this dipshit town.

01:08.470 --> 01:09.929
Baby brother.

01:10.011 --> 01:11.345
But you suddenly
showing up here...

01:11.428 --> 01:13.220
Must mean
you want something.

01:13.303 --> 01:15.178

hands better than fight.

01:15.261 --> 01:17.011
There's a safe?

01:17.095 --> 01:18.345
My father called me.

01:18.428 --> 01:20.345
His alliance with Axe
isn't over.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.053
[Chuck] What other venture
are they embarking upon?

01:22.136 --> 01:24.637
[Sacker] They're going

02:19.553 --> 02:20.512
We should fire him.

02:20.595 --> 02:22.178
Then we will.
Will we?

02:22.261 --> 02:23.595
We said
no exceptions.

02:23.679 --> 02:26.095
The exact words were:
"Strive for no exceptions."

02:26.178 --> 02:29.095
Meaning--
So Winston's the perfect fit.

02:29.178 --> 02:30.637

No.

Winston's Tony Stewart
in 2005.

Cocky 'cause he drives fast,
but too brazen, too cutthroat.

02:35.887 --> 02:37.845
He'll punch you on pit row,
or run you over.

02:37.929 --> 02:39.470
But like Stewart,
he gets results.

02:39.553 --> 02:40.804
Sure.
At Taylor Mason Capital.

02:40.887 --> 02:42.428
But we're building
something new.

02:42.512 --> 02:45.762
Tell me he sees the Matrix
and we're done here.

02:45.845 --> 02:47.553
I can't tell you
he sees the Matrix.

02:47.637 --> 02:50.011
I saw the Matrix before they
even made the fucking movie!

02:50.095 --> 02:52.095
And I was like
five years old then.

02:52.178 --> 02:53.261
Rest my case.

02:53.345 --> 02:55.428
Wait, you really want
to fire me?

02:55.512 --> 02:56.887
I thought I was gonna get
a two percent slice

02:56.970 --> 02:58.553
of the new company.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.512
Dave Mustaine thought
he would return to Metallica.

03:00.595 --> 03:04.470
I get the new slogan:
No more ass-pounding the planet.

03:04.553 --> 03:05.970
Earth-positive approach.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.136
We go to Phish concerts
with our investors.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.804
But we still love money
too, right?

03:10.887 --> 03:13.136
The math works the same
no matter the names we own.

03:13.220 --> 03:15.887
And that is where
you will always need me.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.762
"Need."
Again, that overstates it.

03:18.845 --> 03:20.011
Sell us on what you alone

04:22.053 --> 04:23.512
I'm aware of it.

04:23.595 --> 04:25.470
Well, we would like you
to stall the approval.

04:25.553 --> 04:27.553
And then deny it.

04:27.637 --> 04:29.261
And why would I
do that?

04:29.345 --> 04:31.929
All of the preliminary paperwork
seems fine.

04:32.011 --> 04:33.720
We need straight-up banks
in this state,

04:33.804 --> 04:37.762

You can prevent crimes

04:42.053 --> 04:44.303
just by saying no.

04:44.387 --> 04:47.220
This isn't
Minority Report.

04:47.303 --> 04:48.595
Now, we follow
a process.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.428
A crime happens,
you deal with it later.

04:50.512 --> 04:53.220
Certainly an expert in banking
like yourself understands

04:53.303 --> 04:55.720
the concept of taking out
a line of credit.

04:55.804 --> 04:59.387

[Sacker] Mm.

05:29.679 --> 05:32.929
You seemed awfully upset
about someone when we arrived.

05:33.011 --> 05:36.595
Yeah, that was about
my son's ex-fiancée.

05:36.679 --> 05:38.095
That bitch broke off
the engagement,

05:38.178 --> 05:39.470
but she won't give
the ring back.

05:39.553 --> 05:40.637
Oh.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.011
That ring was smuggled
out of Germany

05:42.095 --> 05:44.553
sewn into the lining
of my father's coat

05:44.637 --> 05:46.095
[Calder] right at the beginning
of World War II.

05:46.178 --> 05:48.720
[Calder] I mean,
that -- that --

05:48.804 --> 05:49.887
It's a family heirloom--

05:49.970 --> 05:52.345
Well.
There may be legal remedies.

05:52.428 --> 05:55.804
We could go after her in court
and get it back.

05:55.887 --> 05:59.762
That would give you a very
special place in my heart.

05:59.845 --> 06:03.845
Drag your feet on the approval
to give me a chance.

06:05.220 --> 06:07.387
Alright.
Let's go get this fucking bank.

you want me to play

No call for that.

06:10.887 --> 06:12.387

a decent jacket.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.762

there is another way.

Nothing.

10:56.178 --> 10:59.428
Yeah, well, sounds like it was
a little too much too soon.

10:59.512 --> 11:01.470

11:01.553 --> 11:04.428

next time.

28:59.095 --> 29:00.553
Okay.

29:00.637 --> 29:02.428
Her yoga class
is about to start.

29:02.512 --> 29:04.428
I should go get set up.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.011
I'm in the water.

29:12.095 --> 29:15.303
Swimming.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.929
Coming up for
a bit of air now.

29:18.011 --> 29:19.637
Is that how you think
of your process?

29:19.720 --> 29:21.345
Like being submerged?

29:21.428 --> 29:24.387
Ah. To call it "my process"
makes me sound like a prick.

29:24.470 --> 29:27.720
Like I'm full of myself.

29:27.804 --> 29:29.887
You give a shit
what other people think?

29:29.970 --> 29:33.470
No. To me. I-I sound like
a prick to myself.

29:35.637 --> 29:39.720
I mean, this shit should just
flow without any thought.

29:39.804 --> 29:43.220
Definitely no thought
of the self.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.679
That's always the goal.

29:45.762 --> 29:47.970
It's the hard part.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.679
Yeah.

29:49.762 --> 29:51.387
See?
I-I knew you would know.

29:51.470 --> 29:52.887
You'd understand.

29:56.303 --> 29:58.345
Really?

29:58.428 --> 30:00.011
We just met.

30:00.095 --> 30:03.178
Yeah, but you see
more than most.

30:03.261 --> 30:04.887
Obviously.

30:06.804 --> 30:09.178
Being around you
makes me feel...

30:09.261 --> 30:10.261
A lot.

30:10.345 --> 30:12.011
It's good.

30:14.428 --> 30:16.178
It's also very exposed.

30:16.261 --> 30:18.762
Hmm.

30:18.845 --> 30:21.637
Prefer to expose yourself
in those, right?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.595
No.
I prefer to live in them.

30:23.679 --> 30:24.762
Not care
about the rest.

30:24.845 --> 30:27.428
You know.
About opinions.

30:27.512 --> 30:28.845
But I want yours.

30:31.679 --> 30:34.345
I have one.

30:34.428 --> 30:36.095
And you'd like it.

30:38.428 --> 30:41.762
But I'm not ready
to offer it yet.

30:41.845 --> 30:44.887
And I'm not sure
I should.

30:44.970 --> 30:49.553
The artist doesn't need me
to tell him what he's saying.

30:49.637 --> 30:54.303
You know, I've thought that if
I met Miles Davis

30:54.387 --> 30:55.887
or Hank Aaron

30:55.970 --> 30:58.679
that, uh, I wouldn't need
to use words

30:58.762 --> 31:00.136
to tell them
why they mattered.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.637
I-I would just
meet their eyes.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.720
And they would know.

31:03.804 --> 31:05.303
And then I would know.

31:05.387 --> 31:08.136
I could never be that cool
in a situation like that...

31:08.220 --> 31:10.845
if I met Megan Rapinoe

31:10.929 --> 31:14.387
or Murakami.

31:14.470 --> 31:17.345
Yeah, well, I-I said I thought
I knew how I would be.

31:17.428 --> 31:19.553
But I actually met
Hank Aaron

31:19.637 --> 31:23.053
ten years back once.

31:23.136 --> 31:24.470
You know what I did?

31:24.553 --> 31:25.845
Tell me.

31:25.929 --> 31:28.053
I asked him to sign
my fucking hat.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.011
[both laugh]

31:30.095 --> 31:32.303
I did. Before I knew it
the words just came out.

31:32.387 --> 31:36.845
The only thing he saw in my eyes
was a pain-in-the-ass fan.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.929
I want to
show you something.

31:42.261 --> 31:44.178
[Lauren] I'm gonna ask you
a couple of questions.

31:44.261 --> 31:45.679
Is this like an online quiz
or something?

31:45.762 --> 31:47.095
No.

31:47.178 --> 31:48.679
And don't try to add 'em up,
see what I'm getting at.

31:48.762 --> 31:50.595
Just answer
one at a time.

31:50.679 --> 31:53.428
And then--
Ask away.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.595
How smart
is Wendy Rhoades?

31:55.679 --> 31:57.804
General intelligence:
top one percent.

31:57.887 --> 31:59.178
Person to person,
with EQ included,

31:59.261 --> 32:02.512
top one half
of one percent.

32:02.595 --> 32:05.178
How good is Wendy Rhoades
at gameplay?

32:05.261 --> 32:07.512
In the important games, the ones
not played on boards or fields:

32:07.595 --> 32:09.720
again, top one half
of one percent.

32:09.804 --> 32:11.553
Why do we like
Wendy Rhoades?

32:11.637 --> 32:13.387
Because:
We do like her.

32:13.470 --> 32:16.136
Is that real?

32:16.220 --> 32:17.345
You asked me
not to jump ahead.

32:17.428 --> 32:19.261
But I have to...

32:19.345 --> 32:20.970
You're really wondering
why we're trusting Wendy.

32:21.053 --> 32:23.387
And you are suggesting
that maybe we shouldn't.

32:23.470 --> 32:25.512
I'm not the only one feeling
this way...

32:25.595 --> 32:27.762
It's a coup d'etat.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.303
I didn't think so.
But he convinced me.

nothing to worry about.

32:40.470 --> 32:42.136
You sure?
Positive.

32:51.178 --> 32:53.011
[Lauren] If we look at it
through this lens,

32:53.095 --> 32:57.470
it's possible Wendy has taken an
interest in me to fuck with you.

32:57.553 --> 32:58.679
And has agreed
to work with you

32:58.762 --> 33:01.095
to destabilize
the entire endeavor.

33:01.178 --> 33:02.345
Yes.
It's possible.

all of us know that--

33:08.970 --> 33:10.261
that danger won't present.

33:10.345 --> 33:12.845
Well, I'm going to
put her on notice.

33:12.929 --> 33:14.470

No.

in the middle of this.

you retain control.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.929
Cut her in,
but limit her.

33:26.011 --> 33:28.178
Yes.
I'm willing to go to 25%.

33:28.261 --> 33:29.970
Cap it at 15%.

33:30.053 --> 33:33.011
Anything more and you're
giving away too much ownership.

33:35.053 --> 33:37.053
