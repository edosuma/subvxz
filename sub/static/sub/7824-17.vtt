11:22.680 --> 11:24.520
that here at the Springfield
Retirement Castle

11:24.580 --> 11:26.280
money <i>does make
a difference.</i>

11:26.350 --> 11:27.920
I mean,
there are rubdowns

11:27.980 --> 11:30.640
and then there are
rubdowns.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.990
Listen, you bloodsucker,
has it ever occurred to you

11:34.060 --> 11:37.390
that old folks deserve
to be treated like human beings

11:37.460 --> 11:39.560
whether they have
money or not?

11:39.630 --> 11:41.170
Yes, but it passes.

11:41.230 --> 11:44.200
You lousy son of a..!

11:44.270 --> 11:46.670
I'll take it.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.870
Hey, big spender,
why the change of heart?

11:48.940 --> 11:51.380
Bea told me
to enjoy my moolah

11:51.440 --> 11:53.810
and I'm going to, dagnabit!

11:53.880 --> 11:55.680
Huh!

11:55.740 --> 11:56.900
Yeah.

11:56.980 --> 11:57.820
Yeah.

12:00.350 --> 12:01.820
So, where to, pappy?

12:01.880 --> 12:03.040
Take me someplace fun.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.390
You're the boss.

12:04.450 --> 12:05.510
Next stop...

12:05.590 --> 12:07.160
Funsville.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.390
Ayah.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.030
Ayah.

12:17.830 --> 12:18.690
Ayah.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.710
I miss Bea.

12:24.770 --> 12:26.270
I miss you too.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.650
( <i>screaming )</i>

12:28.710 --> 12:30.980
Oh, Abraham,
calm down.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.720
I'm not here
to scare you.

12:32.780 --> 12:35.120
They've got me haunting
a family in Texas.

12:35.180 --> 12:37.710
Oh, I'm glad
you're keeping busy.

12:37.790 --> 12:42.330
Now listen Abe.
I want to know why my money
isn't bringing you happiness?

12:42.390 --> 12:45.800
Oh, Bea, I'm not cut out
for the high life.

12:45.860 --> 12:48.400
Abraham, if you're not happy
with the money

12:48.460 --> 12:50.660
why don't you
spread it around?

12:50.730 --> 12:53.570
Make other people
as happy as you made me.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.210
Oh, thanks, Bea, I will.

12:56.270 --> 12:57.740
And go see your son.

12:57.810 --> 12:58.940
He misses you.

12:59.010 --> 13:02.480
Oh, I miss him, too,
the big, fat Dickens.

13:02.540 --> 13:05.210
Hey, Bea, I've got to ask you.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.950
What was death like?

13:08.020 --> 13:09.420
Not as scary

13:09.480 --> 13:10.140
as this!

13:11.050 --> 13:12.280
( <i>all screaming )</i>

13:12.350 --> 13:15.650
I miss my Daddy.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.420
This thing
with your Dad

13:17.490 --> 13:20.630
has had you moping
around the house for days.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.830
I think it's time for you
to talk to someone
who understands.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.270
<i>Hiya. You've reached</i>

13:25.330 --> 13:27.130
<i>Doctor Marvin Monroe's
anxiety line.</i>

13:27.200 --> 13:28.470

13:28.540 --> 13:31.610
<i>If you have a sullen teenager,
press one now.</i>

13:31.670 --> 13:34.770
<i>If you're estranged from
your spouse, press two, now.</i>

13:34.840 --> 13:35.970
<i>If you have trouble
maintaining...</i>

13:36.040 --> 13:36.740
Grampa!

13:36.810 --> 13:37.680
Huh?

13:37.750 --> 13:38.650
Dad!

13:38.710 --> 13:39.970
Sonny boy!

13:41.550 --> 13:45.220
Is there room at your table
for a foolish old man?

13:45.290 --> 13:46.960
Well, sure.

13:47.020 --> 13:50.490
We'll have to move a chair
in from the den, but it's no
problem.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.000
Bart!

13:52.060 --> 13:53.330
Choose
your corn cob.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.400
<i>En garde.</i>

13:54.460 --> 13:55.990
Challenge accepted.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.430
All my precious stacks
of gold...

13:58.500 --> 13:59.870
( <i>Homer belching )</i>

13:59.930 --> 14:03.000
Couldn't buy the pleasures
of a simple family meal.

14:03.070 --> 14:04.310
Pass the bug juice, Dad.

14:04.370 --> 14:05.930
Wait your turn, you pig.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.750
I have an announcement to make.

14:08.810 --> 14:11.750
I've decided to give
Bea's money away.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.570
<i>There are people who
really need it.</i>

14:13.650 --> 14:15.090
I'm gonna let them
come to me

14:15.150 --> 14:17.550
and plead their case,
and then I'll decide

14:17.620 --> 14:19.490
who needs it most.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.620
Grampa, that's the
noblest thought that's

14:21.690 --> 14:22.760
ever been expressed
at this table.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.550
Give it to us, Grampa.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.160
Bart!

14:25.230 --> 14:26.800
Forgive him, Dad.

14:26.860 --> 14:28.130
<i>He's just
a stupid little kid,</i>

14:28.200 --> 14:30.900
who says the first thing
that pops into his head

14:30.970 --> 14:32.940
but you know, there's wisdom
in his innocence.

14:33.000 --> 14:33.800
You don't want it.

14:33.870 --> 14:34.970
Yes I do.

14:35.040 --> 14:35.940
Too bad,
you ain't gettin' it.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.210
Not since this reporter's
marriage

14:39.270 --> 14:40.700
to Stephanie the Weather lady

14:40.780 --> 14:44.050
has this town been so consumed
with rumor and innuendo.

14:44.110 --> 14:45.750
All because of this man.

14:45.810 --> 14:48.280
Today, one
Abraham "Grampa" Simpson

14:48.350 --> 14:51.290
announced that he will give away
over $100,000

14:51.350 --> 14:55.350
to the person or persons
he finds most deserving.

14:55.420 --> 14:59.490
Is Grampa Simpson a modern day
saint, a rich nut or both?

14:59.560 --> 15:01.370
Only time will tell.

15:01.430 --> 15:05.140
This is Kent Brockman,
on-line for an old man's money.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.840
Ah, you see, Gramp

15:06.900 --> 15:08.440
I want to customize the bus.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.030
You know, chop the top

15:10.100 --> 15:12.700
jack it up,
put mag wheels on it

15:12.770 --> 15:14.740
psychedelic paint job
from hell, man.

15:14.810 --> 15:18.020
Jam the kids to school
at 150 miles an hour.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.080
Here's an artist's rendering.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.790
Note the cobra wrapped
around the naked chick.

15:22.850 --> 15:24.620
- Next.
- Duh.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.290
Grampa...

15:27.360 --> 15:28.630
I can call you "Grampa,"
can't I?

15:28.690 --> 15:29.760
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

15:29.820 --> 15:33.020
Alright. I need
that money, please.

15:33.090 --> 15:34.560
Wait a minute. Wait.

15:34.630 --> 15:37.230
You're that guy who owns
the nuclear power plant.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.500
The ownership is divided.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.200
What the hell do you
think you are doing?

15:40.270 --> 15:42.340
Mr. Simpson, I dread the day

15:42.400 --> 15:44.770
when $100,000
isn't worth groveling for.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.480
Get out of here!

15:46.540 --> 15:50.950
You just made yourself
a very powerful enemy, old man.

15:51.010 --> 15:53.010
Here's the deal, Grampa.

15:53.080 --> 15:57.490
A guy I think was an explorer
left this in the bar one night.

15:57.550 --> 16:00.160
It may be a map
to ancient treasure

16:00.220 --> 16:02.190
or directions
to some guy's house

16:02.260 --> 16:04.600
but to find out,
we'll need money, provisions

16:04.660 --> 16:06.300
and a two-man diving bell.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.700
It's pretty stupid

16:07.760 --> 16:09.760
but so far,
you're the front-runner.

16:10.930 --> 16:13.000
It's a special
isolation chamber.

16:13.070 --> 16:16.110
The subject pulls levers
to receive food and warmth.

16:16.170 --> 16:18.110
The floor can become
electrified

16:18.170 --> 16:21.370
and showers of icy water
randomly fall on the subject.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.540
I call it the "Monroe Box."

16:23.610 --> 16:26.880
Well, it sounds
interesting.
Uh-huh.

16:26.950 --> 16:28.750
How much will
it cost to build?

16:28.820 --> 16:29.890
That's the beauty part.

16:29.950 --> 16:31.020
It's already built.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.060
I need the money
to buy a baby

16:33.120 --> 16:34.630
to raise in the box
until the age of 30.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.060
What are you trying to prove?

16:36.120 --> 16:39.320
My theory is that the subject
will be socially maladjusted

16:39.390 --> 16:41.860
and will harbor
a deep resentment towards me.

16:41.930 --> 16:43.770
Hmm, interesting.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.440
Let's see.
I want a tear gas pen

16:45.500 --> 16:47.810
a blow gun
with paralyzer darts...

16:47.870 --> 16:48.810
Oh, no.

16:48.870 --> 16:49.940
Nunchakus.

16:50.000 --> 16:50.730
Nunchakus?
Yeah.

16:50.810 --> 16:51.880
What the hell are those?

16:51.940 --> 16:54.510
A copy of
<i>Radioactive Man, #27--</i>

16:54.580 --> 16:55.680
that's the first time
he fights Dr. Crab--

16:55.740 --> 16:58.470
and I wanna buy that
baseball card

16:58.550 --> 16:59.420
where the guy's
flipping the bird.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.980
Oh yeah,
I've seen that one.

17:01.050 --> 17:01.850
Oh, and a monkey.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.560
What the hell is that?

17:04.619 --> 17:06.359
Why, it's a death ray,
my good man.

17:06.420 --> 17:07.859
Behold.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.220
Hey, feels warm.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.300
Kind of nice.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.930
Well, it is just the prototype.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.119
With proper funding,
I'm confident this
little baby

17:15.200 --> 17:18.270
could destroy an area
the size of New York City.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.430
But I want to help people,
not kill them.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.910
Well, to be honest

17:21.970 --> 17:24.410
the ray only has
evil applications.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.730
You know, my wife
will be happy.

17:26.810 --> 17:30.180
She's hated this whole
death ray thing from day one.

17:30.240 --> 17:35.480
Oh, Lisa, what makes you think
you deserve all that money?

17:35.550 --> 17:37.690
I don't deserve it, Grampa.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.120
No one here does.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.890
The people who deserve it
are on the streets

17:41.960 --> 17:43.290
<i>and they're in the slums.</i>

17:43.360 --> 17:45.460
They're little children
who need more library books

17:45.530 --> 17:47.600
and families
who can't make ends meet.

17:47.660 --> 17:51.000
Of course, if you really
wanted to, you could
buy me a pony.

17:51.070 --> 17:51.940
You're right.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.200
I'll name her Princess

17:53.270 --> 17:55.470
and I'll ride her every day.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.410
No, you're right
about all the poor souls

17:57.470 --> 17:59.140
who need a helping hand.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.880
I need to take a walk
to clear my head.

18:05.180 --> 18:05.850
Oh, dear.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.640
( <i>baby crying )</i>

18:13.220 --> 18:15.590
Ah, I'm exhausted.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.060
Oh, poor baby.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.700
Been lifting
your wallet?

18:18.760 --> 18:20.500
No-- I'll have you know

18:20.560 --> 18:24.400
I've decided to give my money
away to truly needy causes.

18:24.470 --> 18:25.270
Hmm.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.930
But $100,000 just isn't enough.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.630
I need more.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.630
Why don't you go on
the seniors' gambling junket?

18:32.710 --> 18:35.310
I bet you could
double your money
or even triple it.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.880
Well, it's tempting.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.970
Plus, they got a 99¢
shrimp cocktail.

18:39.050 --> 18:39.920
You sold me.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.180
Slow down.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.460
Are you trying
to get us killed?

18:45.520 --> 18:46.620
It's too hot, ya' maniac.

18:46.690 --> 18:47.960
Turn on the air.

18:48.020 --> 18:50.020
Hey, mellow out, old dudes

18:50.090 --> 18:52.600
or I'll jam this baby
into a river

18:52.660 --> 18:54.100
all right?

18:54.160 --> 18:57.100
( <i>humming to Edgar Winter's
"Frankenstein" )</i>

18:57.170 --> 18:58.770
Miss, I'm looking
for Abe Simpson.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.760
It's important I
get a hold of him.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.710
I have to tell him
I don't care about his money

19:02.770 --> 19:04.040
and I love him.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.680
We get that a lot.

19:05.740 --> 19:07.880
He left with
the senior casino junket.

19:07.940 --> 19:08.840
Casino?

19:08.910 --> 19:09.510
Ah!

19:11.480 --> 19:13.920
( <i>humming to
Jethro Tull's "Aqualung" )</i>

19:13.980 --> 19:15.020
Come on, everybody!

19:24.060 --> 19:26.300
Hello, I am Plato.

19:26.360 --> 19:30.570
Please partake of keno, craps
and the loosest slots in town.

19:30.630 --> 19:33.800
My philosophy is "enjoy."

19:35.470 --> 19:37.310
Change, please.

19:42.610 --> 19:45.520
A double cheeseburger, onion
rings, large strawberry shake

19:45.580 --> 19:47.350
and, for God sakes, hurry.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.690
$5,000 on...

19:50.750 --> 19:51.690
What century is this?

19:51.750 --> 19:52.650
The 20th.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.790
Great.
Put it on #20.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.130
Excuse me.

19:55.190 --> 19:57.160
Have you seen an old man
with a lot of money?

19:57.230 --> 19:58.560
He looks like me,
but he's wrinkled.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.900
Hello. Have you seen
a... Dad!

20:00.960 --> 20:04.840
No-o-o-o-o-o!

20:04.900 --> 20:06.000
Dealer: 20 black.
( <i>Abe laughing )</i>

20:06.070 --> 20:07.000
Holy moley.

20:07.070 --> 20:08.010
You're winning.

20:08.070 --> 20:09.010
Beat it, boy.

20:09.070 --> 20:10.940
You're cramping my style.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.310
Dad, please, you gotta
quit while you're ahead.

20:12.370 --> 20:14.000
You got to take your money
and leave, now.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.180
Sorry, boy.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.800
I have to get enough
to help everybody.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.750
But you could lose everything.
Come on!

20:18.810 --> 20:19.840
Homer

20:19.910 --> 20:23.080
I think Rudyard Kipling
said it best.

20:23.150 --> 20:26.890
"If you can make one heap
of all your winnings

20:26.950 --> 20:30.850
"and risk it on one turn
of pitch and toss, and lose

20:30.930 --> 20:33.830
"and start again
at your beginnings

20:33.900 --> 20:37.600
"and never breathe a word
about your loss

20:37.670 --> 20:43.510
"yours is the Earth
and everything that's in it.

20:43.570 --> 20:47.340
And, which is more,
you'll be a man, my son."

20:47.410 --> 20:48.550
You'll be a bonehead.
Come on.

20:48.610 --> 20:50.280
Put it all on 41.

20:50.340 --> 20:52.540
I've got a feeling
about that number.

20:52.610 --> 20:54.110
The wheel only goes to 36.

20:54.180 --> 20:56.220
Okay, put it all on 36.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.540
I've got a feeling
about that number.

20:57.620 --> 21:00.390
Dad! No!
Give me that money.

21:00.450 --> 21:01.380
Come on.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.430
Stop it.

21:02.490 --> 21:03.890
Ow! You're hurting me!

21:03.960 --> 21:04.700
Thirty-six!

21:04.760 --> 21:06.630
No more bets.

21:06.690 --> 21:10.320
Son, if this lands on 36,
I'll...

21:10.400 --> 21:11.570
Double zero.

21:11.630 --> 21:14.730
Son, you saved me
from losing all my money.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.770
For the first time in my life,
I'm glad I had children.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.550
So, uh, have you figured out

21:21.610 --> 21:23.610
who gets the money?

21:30.380 --> 21:33.450
Yes, Homer, I have.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.340
( <i>crowd gasping )</i>

21:46.400 --> 21:47.700
Come on in.

21:47.770 --> 21:50.640
Dignity's on me, friends.

21:56.980 --> 22:00.280
