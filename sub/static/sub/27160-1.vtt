WEBVTT

00:07.081 --> 00:08.561
Hildur Odegard was murdered.

00:08.641 --> 00:09.961
So who murdered her?

00:10.361 --> 00:11.641
No! Erling!

00:14.721 --> 00:15.641
I'll show you...

00:22.201 --> 00:24.401
Dan Anderssen. Is he a good sheriff...

00:25.281 --> 00:26.361
or a bad sheriff?

00:27.241 --> 00:29.761
You know what I've discovered?
I'm both.

00:30.041 --> 00:31.921
You were infected
by parasitic wasp larvae.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.561
The wasp larvae carry a
microscopic parasite into their host.

00:35.881 --> 00:36.921
The host usually dies.

00:38.401 --> 00:41.881
But if it doesn't, it's able to
regenerate tissue and organs.

00:41.961 --> 00:45.801
It can even pull bodies out of the
Arctic water without noticing the cold.

00:45.881 --> 00:48.441
I'm...not human?

00:48.681 --> 00:51.681
Of course you're human,
you're just...different.

00:52.081 --> 00:53.081
Unique.

00:56.481 --> 00:58.721
Why didn't you tell someone,
because you love him?

01:00.361 --> 01:02.081
Freya? Freya?

01:08.241 --> 01:11.041
Natalie. Can you see? Anything?
Can you see anything at all?

01:11.161 --> 01:12.401
Light and dark.

01:14.201 --> 01:16.521
That's it.
There's nothing else now.

01:16.721 --> 01:19.721
Your research was sponsored
by Schenthal Biotech.

01:20.001 --> 01:21.081
It's a pharmaceutical company.

01:21.841 --> 01:22.841
All the hard drives...

01:32.801 --> 01:34.161
- You're back.
- Yep.

01:34.681 --> 01:35.921
I think I am.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.481
Larry's passport came through.

02:58.281 --> 02:59.441
Flights are confirmed.

03:01.761 --> 03:03.921
I'll shut the place up,
and we can head out this evening.

03:07.641 --> 03:10.281
He's smoking weed.
I can smell it.

03:10.601 --> 03:13.081
That's largely what Larry does.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.601
Take the drugs from him, Boyd.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.521
I want his system clear.

03:29.841 --> 03:33.881
Larry, my wife has a surprise for you.

03:36.361 --> 03:39.281
Your passport's arrived,
you're coming with us.

03:39.641 --> 03:41.721
That's awesome, man.

03:41.801 --> 03:43.521
Yeah, I never been to the Arctic before.

03:44.481 --> 03:46.561
Well, I haven't been out
of California, but...

03:48.201 --> 03:49.321
You gotta lose the reefer, Larry.

03:51.921 --> 03:54.481
What?
- Airport dogs smell it.

03:54.961 --> 03:57.801
Customs run a check, they'll see that
your real ID doesn't match the fake ID

03:57.881 --> 04:00.361
on the passport we bought
and you go back to jail.

04:01.001 --> 04:01.921
OK, Jesus.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.561
OK, Boyd.

04:34.841 --> 04:37.241
What's your point?

04:37.361 --> 04:39.481
I always think this is childish.

04:41.001 --> 04:42.481
What is?
- The murder board

04:42.561 --> 04:45.601
and the... photos and the string.

04:45.801 --> 04:48.681
It's like a kindergarten project.
- Big storm's here.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.601
Tundersno.
- What's tundersno?

04:52.761 --> 04:56.321
Thunder and lightning.
Inside a snow storm.

04:56.841 --> 04:58.041
It's really pretty bad.

04:58.121 --> 05:02.201
And if nine weeks are not enough,
then we come back again!

05:02.321 --> 05:03.521
Come back for what?

05:03.601 --> 05:07.561
At this point I still do not know how
Governor Munk met his death.

05:08.201 --> 05:09.881
So we'll be back.

05:10.201 --> 05:13.001
He threw himself
out of his office window.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.921
I didn't kill him.
Sheriff Anderssen didn't kill him.

05:16.121 --> 05:18.641
A mob of townsfolk with burning torches

05:19.281 --> 05:22.001
and... and...
and pitchforks didn't kill him.

05:22.641 --> 05:23.721
He killed himself.

05:25.041 --> 05:26.321
Finally. Please.

05:26.561 --> 05:27.761
I return to the facts.

05:28.201 --> 05:30.521
A very unfit, 110-kilo man

05:30.961 --> 05:32.681
threw himself
through a plate glass window.

05:32.801 --> 05:36.361
A 110-kilo man
who was off his head on muscimol.

05:36.441 --> 05:39.281
Come on, Ingeborg, we go round
and round and round on this

05:39.361 --> 05:42.201
but you still persist
with this...shit...

05:42.601 --> 05:45.521
about a er...vengeful mob.

05:46.161 --> 05:49.601
Were they all high on muscimol too?
Is that your... Is that your theory?

05:51.001 --> 05:53.121
"Detective Chief Inspector Myklebust."

05:53.361 --> 05:56.481
Let's not get over-familiar, Eric,
just because I'm going home tomorrow.

05:57.361 --> 06:00.681
Believe me,
I do not have any inclination

06:00.761 --> 06:04.561
to let myself get over-familiar
with you or your...

06:04.961 --> 06:07.361
irritating...monkey nerd!

06:13.681 --> 06:14.561
Ingrid?

06:16.241 --> 06:19.161
"Monkey nerd"?
- You want the string as well?

06:22.441 --> 06:23.561
"Vengeful mob".

06:24.001 --> 06:27.161
Vengeful mob, angry mob.
It's all the same fucking fairy story.

06:28.161 --> 06:30.161
Vengeful implies motive, Eric.

06:30.241 --> 06:32.201
Suddenly there's a motive
for the death of Munk.

06:33.401 --> 06:34.401
It's your word.

06:54.681 --> 06:55.801
What's the matter, Olaf?

07:03.721 --> 07:04.721
Closer.

07:18.441 --> 07:19.441
Hey!

07:20.681 --> 07:23.561
Happy Harvey Day!
- Happy Harvey...

07:23.881 --> 07:26.401
What the hell is that?
- Harvey Day.

07:26.561 --> 07:28.961
It's traditional.
- I've never heard of it.

07:29.041 --> 07:32.721
It's a new tradition.
- Take off that ridiculous rabbit head.

07:32.961 --> 07:36.001
It's not a rabbit, it's a pooka!
- Take it off!

07:36.161 --> 07:37.841
Do you want to spoil Harvey Day

07:37.921 --> 07:39.601
for all those little children?

07:39.961 --> 07:41.561
You're not going near
any little children!

07:41.641 --> 07:43.721
Now take it off!

07:43.801 --> 07:44.721
What is wrong with you?

07:45.721 --> 07:48.681
The whole town knows what you are,
Markus Husekleppe.

07:48.841 --> 07:50.801
Stay away or I'll call the police.

07:50.961 --> 07:53.121
Nobody likes you!

07:55.841 --> 07:57.561
Miserable cunt!

08:01.361 --> 08:02.201
Aargh!

08:05.321 --> 08:08.801
DCI Myklebust has decided
Governor Munk was murdered.

08:12.361 --> 08:13.321
Who killed him?

08:14.721 --> 08:16.681
The vengeful mob killed him.

08:19.801 --> 08:21.321
Whatever gave her that idea?

08:23.481 --> 08:24.481
I did.

08:29.561 --> 08:31.321
Revenge is all I think about.

08:37.161 --> 08:39.361
650 hours of interviews.

08:39.481 --> 08:43.401
And among them all,
Ketil Blaksdvedt, Axel, Hong, Lars.

08:43.601 --> 08:45.441
Till I knew they killed Munk.

08:45.681 --> 08:47.641
Because Munk murdered Hildur.

08:49.961 --> 08:52.441
Dan, those men did
what I should have done.

08:59.561 --> 09:00.681
They loved Hildur.

09:02.441 --> 09:03.601
They avenged her.

09:05.361 --> 09:06.401
You are thinking...

09:07.681 --> 09:11.961
if you really loved Hildur,
you would've killed Munk yourself.

09:18.401 --> 09:22.481
All the time we've been here
nobody has ever used the word "revenge".

09:23.481 --> 09:26.161
- About Governor Munk?
- About Governor Munk.

09:27.521 --> 09:29.521
Who used it?

09:30.121 --> 09:31.841
Eric. Today.

09:32.361 --> 09:33.681
He said "vengeful mob".

09:34.561 --> 09:36.681
And when I pointed it out to him,
he couldn't look at me.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.521
Two Harvey Happy burgers.

09:44.321 --> 09:48.001
"Harvey Happy burgers"?
They're not on the menu.

09:48.201 --> 09:52.281
Oh, they're a special.
Today is Harvey Day in Fortitude.

09:53.401 --> 09:55.121
Hm. And you recommend them?

09:55.201 --> 09:57.881
They wouldn't be very special if I
couldn't recommend them

09:58.081 --> 09:59.521
now, would they?

10:01.401 --> 10:03.081
And that would be

10:03.161 --> 10:06.441
such a shame now, wouldn't it, Harvey?

10:09.361 --> 10:11.601
Is Harvey invisible?

10:12.401 --> 10:14.761
Yes.

10:20.401 --> 10:21.681
It's a hunting rifle.

10:22.721 --> 10:24.881
<i>Dan, someone's shooting
at people in the main street!</i>

10:51.961 --> 10:53.081
He's on the roof!

11:21.361 --> 11:22.681
Get inside.
Get your head down.

11:31.881 --> 11:33.001
Find access to the roof.

11:33.561 --> 11:34.801
I'll go up the outside.

12:19.201 --> 12:21.681
Drop it or I'll shoot you dead.

12:32.921 --> 12:33.881
Eric!

12:47.721 --> 12:48.601
Hey, you fucker!

12:49.921 --> 12:51.881
No! No, don't shoot!

12:53.041 --> 12:54.361
He's my dad!

12:59.841 --> 13:00.761
What are you doing?

13:25.401 --> 13:27.441
Orcas live in those waters.

13:29.001 --> 13:30.881
Just 20 metres from where we sleep.

13:33.761 --> 13:35.161
I knew you'd like it here.

13:39.121 --> 13:40.601
I'll go check out the garage.

13:41.361 --> 13:42.321
Alright.

13:50.761 --> 13:54.001
What the fuck is an orca?
- Killer whale.

13:54.441 --> 13:55.441
Oh...

13:59.361 --> 14:02.241
You know what I like? Hm?

14:04.521 --> 14:07.081
Killer titties.

14:07.521 --> 14:08.561
That's what I like.

14:15.921 --> 14:19.321
When Orcas feast
on a whale they've killed...

14:21.961 --> 14:25.001
it's always the tongue
they devour first.

14:28.521 --> 14:30.281
Go out and help Boyd, will you?

14:31.761 --> 14:34.281
And then when he goes back to town,
we can be alone.

14:43.241 --> 14:44.521
Yo, Boyd, where you at?

14:57.761 --> 14:59.961
I understand that,
but this is complete madness...

15:00.041 --> 15:02.081
- Black coffee.
- What?

15:02.201 --> 15:04.001
- I don't want any coffee.
- What?

15:04.161 --> 15:05.361
Drink it, Michael!

15:07.801 --> 15:09.641
He missed her by half a metre!

15:09.721 --> 15:11.121
He wasn't shooting at her.
- How do you know that?

15:11.201 --> 15:12.721
Because I know he doesn't even know
who she is.

15:12.801 --> 15:15.641
Yeah, well, an attempt has been made
on the life of a senior investigator.

15:15.761 --> 15:17.401
This wasn't an attempt.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.641
He shot at Sheriff Anderssen too.

15:18.761 --> 15:21.441
If Michael Lennox wanted to shoot Dan
then Dan would be dead.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.641
Yeah, well, he would be
if Lennox wasn't so drunk.

15:23.721 --> 15:27.441
I know you want me
to just ignore this, but I'm not sure we can.

15:29.081 --> 15:30.881
Are you all happy letting the town drunk

15:30.961 --> 15:32.481
just wander around shooting a rifle?

15:32.561 --> 15:34.561
He is not the town drunk!

15:35.801 --> 15:37.481
All the time. Night and day.

15:37.641 --> 15:39.681
Your father is drinking
himself to death.

15:50.881 --> 15:55.041
Well, I'm going to take a statement
from Michael Lennox.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.081
Eric says you've finally concluded

16:01.161 --> 16:02.801
that Governor Munk was murdered?

16:03.561 --> 16:05.841
I've known this for some time.

16:06.881 --> 16:09.921
I've seen nothing in the interview
transcripts to support that.

16:10.001 --> 16:11.441
It's not what they all say
that's important.

16:11.881 --> 16:15.561
Also what they don't say.
- What who doesn't say?

16:16.161 --> 16:17.161
Everybody.

16:17.401 --> 16:19.001
So you've based your conclusion

16:19.481 --> 16:22.121
on the overwhelming weight
of what nobody has said.

16:29.721 --> 16:31.641
They're considering a charge
of attempted murder.

16:37.401 --> 16:38.521
You took my coat.

16:39.481 --> 16:40.361
Are you cold?

16:40.881 --> 16:42.081
There's a bottle in it.

16:43.721 --> 16:44.881
You can't drink in here, Michael.

16:49.041 --> 16:52.161
Let me out.
- Why were you shooting off your rifle?

16:55.241 --> 16:56.441
Do you know who she is?

16:59.161 --> 17:01.721
Someone. Cop.

17:03.721 --> 17:05.801
You know why she's here?

17:07.601 --> 17:09.081
No.
- Ingrid never told you?

17:12.281 --> 17:13.561
We don't talk much.

17:17.481 --> 17:19.281
Er... You need to er...

17:20.601 --> 17:21.801
make a statement.

17:24.241 --> 17:25.321
OK.

17:26.841 --> 17:28.281
Fuck you, Eric.

17:30.001 --> 17:31.161
We'll talk when you've sobered up.

17:34.481 --> 17:35.561
There was a bear.

17:37.001 --> 17:38.001
What?

17:39.561 --> 17:40.521
Bear.

17:42.121 --> 17:43.561
It went into the school.

17:43.681 --> 17:47.441
I saw it.
Went to take my gun out the truck.

17:47.921 --> 17:49.281
A bear.
- Mm.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.241
I killed that bear...

17:55.761 --> 17:56.761
already.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.641
Bear came back.

18:01.801 --> 18:03.561
Maybe it can't be killed.

19:10.001 --> 19:11.681
You're in good hands, Larry.

19:31.761 --> 19:35.561
You're in good hands.
My husband has done this before.

19:37.961 --> 19:40.561
I'm sorry
but you have to be wide awake

19:40.641 --> 19:42.761
for the duration of the procedure.

19:44.001 --> 19:46.401
Alright.

20:19.521 --> 20:21.801
Put his fluids
through the centrifuge.

20:22.601 --> 20:24.081
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

20:25.121 --> 20:26.321
I'm sure.

21:05.081 --> 21:08.321
Detective Inspector Myklebust.

21:09.241 --> 21:10.681
I heard you're leaving tomorrow.

21:10.881 --> 21:13.881
And you have made no arrests?
- Yup.

21:14.881 --> 21:15.921
Wall of silence.

21:19.721 --> 21:22.161
We heard all about
your troubles, Markus.

21:22.361 --> 21:24.201
The terrible business
with the fat girl.

21:27.761 --> 21:29.721
Shirley was not "the fat girl".

21:31.081 --> 21:33.201
People can be so...judgmental.

21:33.401 --> 21:35.081
And nobody likes an outcast.

21:37.201 --> 21:38.641
What do you mean?

21:40.401 --> 21:43.801
The whistle-blower. Someone who
doesn't care about public opinion.

21:44.001 --> 21:45.441
But is prepared to do the right thing.

21:46.761 --> 21:48.281
Make a stand against the mob.

21:52.161 --> 21:53.681
Do you think I am a stupid man?

21:56.361 --> 21:59.241
No, Mr Husekleppe,
I don't think that for one moment.

22:01.081 --> 22:03.441
An exchange would be made,
in return for information.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.881
What do you have to give
that I could possibly want?

22:07.121 --> 22:10.841
We have something in mind that we
are confident you would find acceptable.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.761
We saw your application, Markus.

22:15.641 --> 22:16.641
The letter you wrote.

22:19.001 --> 22:20.001
Letter to Oslo.

22:23.561 --> 22:25.481
I've uh... I've burned all his things.

22:26.361 --> 22:28.241
Oh... That's good, Boyd.

22:29.921 --> 22:31.081
That's good.

22:32.001 --> 22:34.321
What er...
What dosage did you give yourself?

22:34.881 --> 22:38.361
135 milligrams.

22:39.721 --> 22:42.721
What dilution?
- 80 per cent.

22:43.601 --> 22:47.001
Jesus, Elsa.
That's enough to raise the goddamn dead.

22:49.161 --> 22:51.081
How do you feel?

22:51.241 --> 22:52.401
Stronger.

22:52.921 --> 22:55.321
Ahh! Already I feel stronger.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.161
Skin's tingling.

23:03.041 --> 23:04.361
So, er...what do you need, honey?

23:05.081 --> 23:08.201
Well...I haven't done the dishes.

23:16.721 --> 23:18.481
I'll be pupating when you get home.

They didn't get on a plane.
Myklebust is still here.

24:16.601 --> 24:18.481
She went to the school
and spoke to Markus.

24:20.481 --> 24:21.601
Then Markus...

24:22.601 --> 24:23.601
will give them names.

24:25.241 --> 24:29.401
And one of those names...
will be Lars Ulvinaune.

24:31.481 --> 24:33.001
You think Lars is the weak link?

24:33.881 --> 24:36.361
I think Lars
is too honest for this world.

24:39.801 --> 24:40.881
Are you OK, Dan?

24:42.001 --> 24:45.521
I've just taken
a very large drink of Muscimol.

24:46.361 --> 24:47.481
OK.

24:50.001 --> 24:52.001

26:24.161 --> 26:25.801
Busy, Lars?
- Yeah. Yeah.

26:26.401 --> 26:29.521
That tundersno storm dumped
an awful lot of snow across the bay.

26:29.641 --> 26:31.361
Not seen anything like that for a while.

26:31.481 --> 26:33.681
I know. Weather's crazy.

26:33.801 --> 26:36.481
Yeah.
My snow-plough is exhausted.

26:37.081 --> 26:39.161
Could do with a holiday.
- Ah. She sure could.

26:39.321 --> 26:41.841
No. I meant you, Lars.
- Me?

26:42.401 --> 26:44.281
No, I don't have any time
for a holiday, Petra.

26:44.401 --> 26:47.161
The investigators from Oslo
are re-interviewing people.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.401
What people?
- You should get out of town.

26:51.801 --> 26:54.041
I should?
- Your hunting cabin. Go hunting.

26:55.361 --> 26:56.601
But what about the snow dump?

26:57.401 --> 26:58.841
The snow will turn to slush.

26:59.121 --> 27:00.601
Really?
- Now.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.161
Tonight.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.681
Don't fuck about.
- OK.

27:13.521 --> 27:16.841
<i>Were you in the civic centre foyer
when Governor Munk fell to his death?</i>

27:17.961 --> 27:21.201
<i>No. I was not in the civic centre foyer
when he fell.</i>

27:28.761 --> 27:32.201
Eric, you appreciate we require
a secure and confidential environment

27:32.281 --> 27:33.921
for primary suspect interviews.

27:34.081 --> 27:35.761
What the fuck is a primary suspect?

27:36.561 --> 27:37.561
Interview Room One.

27:38.521 --> 27:41.121
<i>Your signature's in the
condolence book for Governor Odegard.</i>

27:42.201 --> 27:43.841
<i>We can work out the times.</i>

27:45.241 --> 27:48.601
<i>I signed the book er...hours before.</i>

27:49.121 --> 27:50.161
<i>Hours before what?</i>

27:51.001 --> 27:53.001
<i>Lars?
- No.</i>

27:54.921 --> 27:56.401
<i>No, I was not in the civic centre.</i>

27:56.601 --> 27:58.401
Lars Ulvinaune is on the spectrum.

27:58.561 --> 28:01.241
When he's asked a question
which he can't answer without lying

28:01.321 --> 28:02.841
then it visibly causes him pain.

28:02.921 --> 28:04.321
He flinches.
<i>- You don't believe me?</i>

28:04.481 --> 28:07.961
- Where will we find Lars Ulvinaune?
<i>- No, I wasn't there. No. No.</i>

28:08.761 --> 28:10.481
<i>- No, I was not in the civic centre.</i>
- The depot.

28:14.361 --> 28:16.481
Caution Mr Fersen
and Mr Blacksdvedt

28:16.601 --> 28:19.081
to remain in town
and be available for further interview.

28:22.161 --> 28:24.801
What... What does this mean?

28:26.921 --> 28:29.601
It means we're going to need
a lot more string.

28:29.721 --> 28:31.721
<i>I er... try to be.</i>

28:33.881 --> 28:35.081
<i>That's it.</i>

28:54.001 --> 28:56.401
Lars? You here?

29:02.841 --> 29:03.841
Mr Ulvinaune?

29:07.841 --> 29:09.121
You're looking for Lars?

29:10.001 --> 29:13.161
Yes.
You know where we'll find him?

29:14.441 --> 29:16.481
Yes, I know.

29:19.481 --> 29:20.881
Lars has gone hunting.

29:23.121 --> 29:24.561
Where has he gone hunting?

29:29.801 --> 29:30.921
Into the wilderness.

29:31.641 --> 29:34.081
Vukobejina.
The place where the wolves fuck.

29:50.841 --> 29:52.081
Hey. We're getting there.

29:53.841 --> 29:54.881
Everything.

29:56.641 --> 29:59.561
Not just Governor Munk.
The missing girl, Elena Ledesma.

29:59.681 --> 30:01.601
The young electrician, Vladek Klimov.

30:02.761 --> 30:06.801
I know.
- Dan Anderssen is all over everything.

30:08.521 --> 30:10.441
This place is...

30:13.521 --> 30:17.041
This place is his own
personal killing field.

30:17.561 --> 30:18.721
I've never...

30:22.601 --> 30:24.281
In all my time I've never known...

30:25.681 --> 30:28.361
Do you think...
Are they all protecting him?

30:28.641 --> 30:29.761
No.

30:30.281 --> 30:31.401
No.

30:32.921 --> 30:34.761
I think they're all in fear of him.

30:36.041 --> 30:38.441
We speak with Lars, the snow-plough
driver. He's the weak link.

30:39.241 --> 30:41.921
When he cracks,
he'll give us the rest of the mob.

30:42.921 --> 30:44.841
When we have them,
they'll give us Dan Anderssen.

31:02.041 --> 31:04.681
Hong Mankyo's not at home.
- What about the store?

31:04.801 --> 31:08.081
He left two hours ago, and
he's not in the Blue Fox either.

31:08.801 --> 31:09.801
Oh.
- What?

31:10.961 --> 31:12.281
Someone's in Hildur's office.

31:18.521 --> 31:21.681
What the fuck were you doing in there?
- I wanted to see if I could erm...

31:23.521 --> 31:26.121
Nothing. I wanted to just...
- Just what?

31:26.801 --> 31:27.881
Just...

31:28.881 --> 31:30.641
acquaint myself
with the environment

31:31.161 --> 31:33.161
before I make my situation public.

31:33.521 --> 31:34.801
What the fuck are you talking about?

31:38.641 --> 31:39.641
This.

31:46.121 --> 31:49.161
"Confirmed in the position
of responsible citizen

31:49.361 --> 31:52.401
with authority and powers
of acting governor

31:52.761 --> 31:55.761
until such time as a permanent
appointment will be made."

31:57.281 --> 32:01.081
I'm sure Oslo will be
informing you all officially.

32:01.761 --> 32:05.121
Probably tomorrow, maybe. Or...

32:09.481 --> 32:11.561
Oslo have made Markus...
- He's our new Governor.

32:22.601 --> 32:24.721
Oh, this is insane.

32:24.881 --> 32:27.801
People living in the freezing cold.

32:29.401 --> 32:32.361
It's just utter fucking craziness.
It's just...

32:34.321 --> 32:36.721
Oh... Elsa?

32:40.841 --> 32:42.841
Oh, shit...

33:22.921 --> 33:24.081
Do you want me, Boyd?

33:40.761 --> 33:42.761
After all this time.
- I...

33:44.521 --> 33:45.601
Elsa...

34:46.761 --> 34:48.521
Hey. It's me.

34:49.081 --> 34:51.041
I'm listening.

34:51.641 --> 34:53.641
<i>That's another one.
Fifth out of this herd.</i>

34:53.801 --> 34:55.521
<i>No question.
This season's calves are smaller.</i>

34:56.681 --> 34:57.601
Are you sure?

34:58.641 --> 35:01.401
No, Dougal, these calves here are small.

35:01.881 --> 35:03.641
Those calves there are far away.

35:11.041 --> 35:12.601
Anyway, I'll er...

35:12.841 --> 35:15.361
<i>Just wait for this little chap to wake up
and I'll see him off site to his mother.</i>

35:15.441 --> 35:19.761
Is there significant muscle development
around the haunch and flank?

35:20.121 --> 35:22.121
Er...yeah, not bad, actually.

35:22.241 --> 35:23.561
Quite meaty.

35:25.561 --> 35:27.121
Then bring it home.

35:44.481 --> 35:47.081
Probably best to get this over and done
with before you wake up, handsome.

36:06.601 --> 36:08.121
What if they're all in it together?

36:10.001 --> 36:13.081
Who?
- The whole town. Everybody.

36:15.641 --> 36:18.321
Like "The Cars That Ate Paris".
- What cars?

36:20.441 --> 36:22.361
Christ!

36:22.681 --> 36:25.201
The younger generation have
all the knowledge of the world

36:25.281 --> 36:28.521
at their fingertips
and yet they know nothing.

36:29.601 --> 36:30.721
Maybe.

36:31.281 --> 36:33.921
Maybe you're just a sour old spinster
who hasn't found a man

36:34.001 --> 36:37.481
who can bear to be with her
because she's such a relentless smart-ass.

36:37.601 --> 36:43.121
Yeah, well, you're sleeping with
a sour old spinster tonight, kid.

36:45.881 --> 36:47.081
What are you looking for?

36:47.561 --> 36:49.561
Dan Anderssen's
original psyche assessment.

36:50.641 --> 36:53.241
It's so out of synch
with the man I'm seeing.

36:53.681 --> 36:54.721
Maybe he's changed.

36:56.161 --> 36:57.481
People don't change.

Can you hear this? What she knew!

37:27.681 --> 37:29.201
It's OK. It's OK.
- Fucking Khatri!

37:29.321 --> 37:32.121
Sssh. It's OK. Calm down.
- You know what this means?

37:32.201 --> 37:33.641
Sssh. Sssh.

37:33.721 --> 37:35.361

We'll work out a better way of...

37:55.561 --> 37:57.281
No. No, Vincent.

to pass the infection on...

38:08.281 --> 38:09.241
Not Dan Anderssen.

38:12.281 --> 38:15.881
Dan was crucified and his hands healed.

38:16.361 --> 38:18.881
Dan went into the frozen water
and he came out undamaged.

38:19.041 --> 38:23.641
At what cost? We don't know
what price Dan Anderssen pays.

38:25.201 --> 38:26.441
What price is this?

38:26.961 --> 38:28.721
Maimed. Blinded. Helpless.

38:31.761 --> 38:33.001
Natalie.

38:36.281 --> 38:39.241
Natalie, the parasites, the wasps,
the larvae, they're dead and gone.

38:40.241 --> 38:41.721
We buried them. You and me.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.401
Oh, Christ.

38:48.721 --> 38:50.961
What if they're not...all gone?
- Christ, no.

38:51.161 --> 38:52.761
Natalie. Oh, my God...

38:53.041 --> 38:56.081
What if a single specimen was preserved
in cryogenic suspension?

38:56.161 --> 38:59.361
I can't fucking believe this!
I'm not gonna...

39:00.641 --> 39:03.361
We destroyed them. Together.
You and me. And now you...

Yes. Whatever the word is.

39:41.321 --> 39:42.521
Not chap.

39:42.961 --> 39:46.241
Someone who does not think
I'm a sour-faced old spinster.

39:47.881 --> 39:50.241
Annie Burgess.
- What?

39:50.921 --> 39:52.601
She's a forensic pathologist.

39:54.201 --> 39:56.081
How the fuck do you know about Annie?

39:56.801 --> 39:59.161
Ingeborg, everybody knows.

Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

Smoke coming out of the chimney.

42:48.081 --> 42:50.081
Hey.

ranger detective

tracking skills and your chimney clues.
