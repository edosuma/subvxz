WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
'The following programme
contains strong language.'

00:48.840 --> 00:51.040
'Just remember.'

00:51.080 --> 00:53.120
One step at a time...

00:53.160 --> 00:55.440
like we said.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.200
They arrest us,
they read us our rights.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.800
We know what we're gonna say.

01:00.840 --> 01:04.440
We've gone through it
a thousand times, and we're ready.

01:05.880 --> 01:09.080
Just don't say a word
without a solicitor. Right?

01:10.640 --> 01:13.640
And remember...you're in charge.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.720
'Then come the police interviews.'

01:17.760 --> 01:20.600
'They'll try to confuse you,
but don't let them.'

01:24.280 --> 01:29.320
'Just tell our story
simply and calmly.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.920
No need to make anything up.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.400
Just tell them the truth.'

01:44.080 --> 01:46.920
'Ah, hello there, Mrs Edwards.'

01:46.960 --> 01:50.320
'Oh, hello. It's Susan Edwards.
You're being offered as my, um...?'

01:50.360 --> 01:53.320
'Yes. My name is Douglas Hylton.
I'm coming in to help you tonight.'

01:53.360 --> 01:56.200
'Oh, good, because you've heard,
I think, that my husband and I

01:56.240 --> 01:58.800
got ourselves into
a bit of a pickle.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.600
I know it sounds all rather morbid.'
'Susan. Susan, sorry, can I -'

02:02.640 --> 02:06.240
'So, for his sake, everyone should
know the truth from the outset.'

02:06.280 --> 02:09.760
'Susan, this isn't a private call.
I'm not your representative yet.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.440
That's what I'm coming to do now,

02:11.480 --> 02:13.560
to take your instruction,
and then I can...

02:13.600 --> 02:16.280
Does that make sense?'
'I see. Yes, sorry, silly old me.'

02:17.560 --> 02:22.320
Just tell our story simply...
and calmly.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.560
No need to make anything up.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.120
Just tell them the truth.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.360
Oh.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.880
Thank you.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.600
Morning, Susan.
Oh, you came back, then.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.680
How was your night?
Oh, you know.

04:03.720 --> 04:08.160
Yeah. First night's the worst.
Ah...the waiting.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.080
Yeah. And also
just not being with Chris.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.600
Even though he's just down
the corridor. Very peculiar.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.080
Yeah.
Still, not for long, though.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.400
Huh?
Sorry.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.400
Ah! Thank you.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.960
Erm, Douglas, I was wondering...

04:24.640 --> 04:26.120
You know your advice...

04:26.160 --> 04:28.760
about not telling
the police anything.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.800
Is that because you
don't believe us?

04:30.840 --> 04:35.000
Um, no. It's just to keep it simple,
so that we don't get tripped up.

04:35.920 --> 04:40.040
To be honest, it's not my job
to have an opinion, really.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.560
My job is to help you.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.600
So, when the police start asking
questions, I just ignore them?

04:45.640 --> 04:48.400
You simply let them know
you prefer not to answer.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.800
Most people like to go with,
"No comment."

04:50.840 --> 04:54.760
"No comment" to everything.
At least until we know...more.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.360
You've gotta remember,
they've only got until tonight

04:59.400 --> 05:02.000
to convince the CPS
that they have enough evidence

05:02.040 --> 05:04.920
to win a trial or get an extension.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.920
If you and Chris don't give them
anything, you might go free.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.480
I can't promise, but it does happen.

05:10.520 --> 05:13.040
OK. So, "No comment."

05:13.080 --> 05:16.760
And how do we let Chris know that
that's the new plan?

05:17.440 --> 05:19.920
I... Erm, we...we don't.

05:21.240 --> 05:26.640
The police aren't mega-keen
on suspects sharing tactics.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.920
It's just Chris never said anything
about "no comment".

05:29.960 --> 05:32.200
We agreed that we would
just tell our story.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.200
We would never have
handed ourselves in if we thought
we had something to hide.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.280
OK, erm...

05:42.320 --> 05:44.040
Tell you what...

05:45.040 --> 05:47.360
How about we...

05:48.920 --> 05:51.400
..write a brief statement.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.160
Just the basics.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.880
Your story in your words,
very short, which I'll read out.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.560
And after that -
"No comment."

05:59.600 --> 06:02.520
Ah, got it. Erm... OK.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.440
So, go for it, as simply as you can.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.760
OK, erm...

06:08.800 --> 06:10.720
The day before my parents' deaths,

06:10.760 --> 06:12.640
I took a National Express coach

06:12.680 --> 06:15.000
from Victoria Coach Station
to Mansfield.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.080
It was route number four-five-O -
it was then -

06:18.120 --> 06:20.160
Er, Susan, sorry.
Could you slow down a bit?

06:20.200 --> 06:23.320
Oh, sorry, sorry.
We don't need the routes and so on.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.320
Just the important stuff.
Oh, OK.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.640
'Ey up. How you feeling?
Fucking wired, mate.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.400
Yeah? Nervous?

06:52.440 --> 06:56.080
Nah, I'm not nervous. I'm wired.
There's a difference.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.760
It's like there's a little
bit of shit in my pants,
but I'm also really excited.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.680
Ah, all power to you, mate.

07:01.720 --> 07:05.000
It's just 15 years, long time
to get their story straight.

07:52.800 --> 07:57.440
'Just tell our story...
simply and calmly.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.840
No need to make anything up.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.280
Just tell them the truth.'

08:05.480 --> 08:08.880
'"On the weekend of
my parents' deaths, in May 1998,

08:08.920 --> 08:11.560
while my husband Christopher
was at our home in London,

08:11.600 --> 08:14.680
I took the National Express coach
number 450

08:14.720 --> 08:16.960
from London to Mansfield
and visited my parents -"'

08:17.000 --> 08:21.520
That was the route number then.
It might be different now,
the way these things go.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.240
Erm, "I... I took the National
Express coach number 450

08:25.280 --> 08:29.160
from London to Mansfield and visited
my parents at their home.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.240
All I'm prepared to say
is that, firstly,

08:31.280 --> 08:34.720
I am not responsible for the death
of my father William Wycherley.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.840
I believe my mother
Patricia Wycherley shot him.

08:37.880 --> 08:42.120
I will say that I did, in fact,
shoot and fatally injure my mother,

08:42.160 --> 08:44.360
but only after severe provocation.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.920
I was in a very fragile
state of mind at the time.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.440
I would like to make it
absolutely clear that my husband

08:49.480 --> 08:52.480
Christopher Edwards had nothing
to do with the deaths of my parents.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.080
He was only made aware
of their deaths by me

08:55.120 --> 08:57.320
one week after the incident."

08:57.360 --> 08:59.000
Signed and dated.

08:59.040 --> 09:03.160
As I've said, it's my handwriting
but it's my client's words.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.920
Thank you, Mr Hylton.
Susan, ARE these your words?

09:06.960 --> 09:10.320
Does that reading accurately reflect
the content of your statement?

09:10.360 --> 09:12.200
No comment.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.800
OK, Susan.
If I go to the end of the statement.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.840
This your signature?
No comment.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.800
It's OK, Susan, you can answer.
Oh, sorry. Yes, that's my signature.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.440
That's all right, Susan.
Your statement's very helpful.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.880
So, tell me, when you say
you went to visit your parents,

09:26.920 --> 09:30.440
what was their address in Mansfield?
5 Braxton Close.

09:30.480 --> 09:34.000
And at that time,
you were 39, just about to turn 40?

09:34.040 --> 09:35.800
Yes.
"No comment."

09:35.840 --> 09:38.920
Erm, again I must stress to you,
that although it's completely...

09:38.960 --> 09:40.880
your decision, my advice remains

09:40.920 --> 09:43.000
that you answer all questions,
"No comment."

09:43.040 --> 09:45.280
No comment.
I can see you're confused, Susan.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.160
Your solicitor and I
are coming from different angles.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.960
But I'm just trying to establish
some extremely basic facts.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.280
So, if you want to, you can answer.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.760
Right?

09:56.520 --> 09:59.600
You say Christopher Edwards
is your husband. When did you marry?

09:59.640 --> 10:00.840
No comment.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.800
Can I ask why you're smiling?

10:02.840 --> 10:04.920
Well...no comment.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.840
Whoa.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.560
We've uncovered some slightly dodgy
financial activity,

10:13.600 --> 10:15.360
which Sandra's looking into,

10:15.400 --> 10:19.040
and apparently they were friends
with Gerard Depardieu...

10:19.080 --> 10:21.800
whatever the fuck
that has to do with anything.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.240
Oh, hello again.
You done?

10:26.280 --> 10:31.040
Yes. Thank you. I-I'm sorry.
Breakfast isn't really my thing.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.320
But my...my compliments
to the chef, though,

10:33.360 --> 10:36.280
or whoever it is that prepares
the microwave packages.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.960
Cos scrambled eggs, they're not
easy to do in bulk, are they?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.120
They often go hard, don't they?
You still going with that?

10:42.160 --> 10:45.680
Oh! Er, no, all done. Thank you.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.520
It was great.
It wasn't what I expected.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.160
Oh, really?
No.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.160
Apres vous.
Merci.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.480
Me, too!

12:52.800 --> 12:55.320
How is it so late?
I've missed the last train!

12:55.360 --> 12:58.000
Well, get a bus.
Or I'll help you with a taxi -
It's already so late!

12:58.040 --> 12:59.880
What's the panic?
It's not the end of the world.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.920
I know it's silly!
But we have...we have this routine.

13:02.960 --> 13:06.320
We usually have a cup of
hot chocolate together at bedtime
and talk about the day.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.360
We've done it since I was little.
It's story time.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.680
Only, I didn't tell him or Mum
that I was gonna be late.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.000
So they'll be waiting up,
wanting to go to bed.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.920
Just phone them.
If they're sleeping,
I'll wake them up.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.040
OK. How about this?
If you want...

13:18.080 --> 13:20.120
If it's easier for your parents,
I mean,

13:20.160 --> 13:23.680
you can stay at mine tonight.
I mean, I'm not...

13:23.720 --> 13:26.240
No, er...no funny business.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.360
But... I've got me mum staying.
She's on the sofa.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.440
A bit of a long story but er...

13:31.480 --> 13:35.080
But, anyway, I'll sleep
on the floor. You can have my room.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.520
Oh, I couldn't make you do that.
No, honestly. I'd be happy to.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.280
And in the morning,
I can help you get home.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.240
Oh, Chris.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.760
'Just to confirm
one more time,

14:04.800 --> 14:09.120
Chris, you are content
for this interview to continue
without a solicitor?'

14:09.160 --> 14:11.160
'I am content.'

14:11.920 --> 14:14.040
I don't need someone
who knows nothing about me

14:14.080 --> 14:16.280
telling me when, and when not,
to speak.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.280
Right, you understand you can change
your mind on that at any time?

14:20.320 --> 14:22.440
So, I've been told.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.280
In fact,
people won't stop telling me.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.480
Right. Thank you.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.280
I can't say I didn't know.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.880
Right, Mr Edwards.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.920
Before we begin
with specific questions,

14:34.960 --> 14:37.760
is there anything you would
like to tell us from the outset,

14:37.800 --> 14:41.000
anything about
why you think you're here?

14:41.040 --> 14:43.360
Yes, I would. Thank you. Ah...

14:43.400 --> 14:46.920
The following is an account
of the events as I recall them.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.840
On a bank holiday weekend
in May, 1998,

14:49.880 --> 14:54.040
my wife Susan Edwards took a coach
from London to visit her parents,

14:54.080 --> 14:56.520
William and Patricia Wycherley,
in Mansfield.

14:56.560 --> 15:00.320
I myself remained at home in London.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.360
Now, I went with my wife
to Mansfield...

15:04.400 --> 15:06.120
the following weekend

15:06.160 --> 15:08.560
and only then
learned of the tragic events

15:08.600 --> 15:11.560
that had transpired
the previous weekend,

15:11.600 --> 15:14.320
ie, the death of her parents.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.200
I wanted to ring the police,
of course,

15:18.240 --> 15:20.440
but my wife can be very fragile

15:20.480 --> 15:23.000
and she convinced me
that nobody would understand

15:23.040 --> 15:25.960
the complexity of what had happened

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and why she was not at fault.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.480
That's when we er...

15:30.520 --> 15:33.080
when we did what families
traditionally used to do -

15:33.120 --> 15:36.720
still do in many parts of the world,
in fact - which is to inter them,

15:36.760 --> 15:40.400
uh, respectfully,
in their own home dwelling.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.120
Or domicile, if you will.

15:43.160 --> 15:47.360
'I mean the thing that's really
tortured me all these years

15:47.400 --> 15:50.600
is had I been with her
on that previous, fateful weekend,

15:50.640 --> 15:53.400
none of this would have happened,
you can be sure of that,

15:53.440 --> 15:57.440
and we wouldn't be sitting here
right now, you gentlemen and I, no.'

15:58.280 --> 16:00.560
'Right, one last question.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.680
Do you happen to recall
the coach company

16:02.720 --> 16:04.680
you and Susan took up to Mansfield?'

16:04.720 --> 16:06.400
'National Express.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.720
Route four-five-O, as it was then.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.480
It might have changed now,
the way these things go.'

16:12.520 --> 16:15.160
'All right, well, I think
we've covered the crux of it,

16:15.200 --> 16:18.560
so erm...we'll take a break there
and pick things up later,

16:18.600 --> 16:21.520
if you don't mind, Mr Edwards.'
'Happy to oblige.'

16:21.560 --> 16:24.880
"Happy to oblige" with the same
bollocks wifey's peddling!

16:24.920 --> 16:27.000
Only difference is
she's got a solicitor.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.320
Yeah, but they've given us
a confession, haven't they?

16:29.360 --> 16:32.120
Of sorts.
Er, "Dear Christophaire,

16:32.160 --> 16:36.200
it was a big mistake to tell
your stepmuzzaire about ze-"
Shut it, Gerard!

16:37.320 --> 16:39.520
What do you reckon they'd get
if we take it, sir?

16:39.560 --> 16:42.640
Not enough. Financial stuff aside,
whatever fraud they've committed -

16:42.680 --> 16:44.800
Oh, yeah, worth doing again,

16:44.840 --> 16:47.600
it went so well
the first fucking time

16:47.640 --> 16:50.840
That's Susan up on loss of control
manslaughter for shooting her mum.

16:50.880 --> 16:54.000
Assuming that "severe provocation"
business holds up.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.040
So, what - five years?

16:56.080 --> 16:59.040
Eight at most. And Chris is only
gettin' a year or two if that.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.600
For what?
Interfering with the duties
of a coroner or some vanilla crap.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.600
Which is not bad if they've
actually committed double murder.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.400
Maybe not such idiots after all.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.920
That story won't hold up in court,
though, will it?

17:09.960 --> 17:11.440
Bullet wounds like that.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.600
It's one shooter,
just a question of who.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.360
I reckon we press him on that -
Sir?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.800
I wonder if we could try something?

17:18.840 --> 17:21.400
Mess with their heads a bit.
Go on.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.240
Could I handle both interviews, sir?

17:28.040 --> 17:30.880
You've got big bollocks today,
don't you, Lancing?

17:33.320 --> 17:37.560
This is your statement, Susan,
now labelled as item EL-06.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.560
We're glad to have it,
but it doesn't begin to explain

17:40.600 --> 17:43.600
how your parents wound up dead
and buried in the garden, does it?

17:43.640 --> 17:45.560
Do you have a question
for my client?

17:45.600 --> 17:49.400
Dozens. How did you first learn
your mother shot your father, Susan?

17:49.440 --> 17:51.400
Where were you?
No comment.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.640
Was it daytime or night-time?
No comment.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.240
What about the gun? Whose was it?

17:55.280 --> 17:56.840
Had you seen it before?
No comment.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.840
What did you do with it afterwards?
No comment.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.760
What did you do with the bodies?
No comment.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.600
Did you wrap them in duvets,
put them under the bed?

18:05.120 --> 18:06.520
No comment.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.960
Did you make a phone call
around 2:00am?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.240
Perhaps to your husband,
Christopher?

18:13.280 --> 18:15.920
Is... Is Chris talking?
What about his solicitor?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.040
No, "No comment."
You said he wouldn't talk!

18:18.080 --> 18:21.400
Your husband's opted not to take
legal advice, Mrs Edwards.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.480
Have you told him it's free?
He knows it's free.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.600
It's just he's chosen
to be cooperative.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.760
He's told my colleagues
everything he can, Susan.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.240
Which makes me look a bit silly,
to be honest.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.320
I'm meant to be the smart one, but
it's Bill and Ben in the other room

18:36.360 --> 18:39.440
getting all the juicy stuff
from your very charming husband.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.120
Only, he wasn't there,
was he, Susan, that night?

18:43.160 --> 18:47.240
So, we're inclined to think
he might be making it all up.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.000
You do want us to know the truth,
don't you?

18:50.040 --> 18:52.480
My advice remains -
You said he wouldn't talk!

18:52.520 --> 18:55.680
Now he's doing one thing, I'm doing
another, and we're not together.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.280
I'm sorry.
It's actually...it...it's quite...

18:58.320 --> 19:00.480
erm, strange.
Does Chris know anything -

19:00.520 --> 19:02.120
Chris is very clever man.
Don't worry.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.000
Perhaps you'd like to take a -
No, I would not!

19:05.040 --> 19:07.920
'OK, Susan,
can we go back to the beginning?'
'Yes, of course.'

19:07.960 --> 19:10.400
'Thank you. Let's break it down
one step at a time.'

19:10.440 --> 19:12.160
Big balls.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.880
Er, do you want me
to leave you alone for a bit?

19:36.920 --> 19:39.280
Or I can show you
where to get some fresh air -

19:39.320 --> 19:41.440
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.720
OK.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.520
You're doing really well.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.800
Am I?

19:50.840 --> 19:54.920
Yeah. Er, definitely.
Just...stay strong.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.400
Try not to take the bait.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.080
OK.

20:07.560 --> 20:12.560
It's October 31st, 2013.
The time is 13:31.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.120
Interview with Christopher Edwards.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.240
Hello, Mr Edwards.
How are you today?

20:17.280 --> 20:22.320
Never better. May I ask what
happened to the other two officers?

20:22.360 --> 20:24.880
Something more important than this,
apparently.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.640
Very rude, if you ask me.
But, anyway...

20:27.680 --> 20:30.840
And thank you for providing
such a thorough account

20:30.880 --> 20:33.880
of the awful events of May 1998.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.440
It's a very sad story, Mr Edwards.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.800
It is. Yes I'm...very happy to help.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.840
Would you mind
if we just review a few things?
Not at all, Detective Constable.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.280
Susan was up with her parents
in Mansfield.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.320
You're at home in London,
in Dagenham.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.400
She rings you up
in the middle of the night.

20:50.440 --> 20:53.120
You answer. What does she say?

20:53.160 --> 20:56.920
Nothing, really. She couldn't
tell me anything. She was too upset.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.280
'Upset about what?'

20:58.320 --> 21:01.640
I need you, Chris.
It's all wrong without you.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.520
'Well, she'd had a terrible night.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.880
Her mother was drunk,
her father abusive.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.360
The usual story, I'm sad to say.'

21:08.400 --> 21:11.400
I can't wait to get back...
to London.

21:30.760 --> 21:34.560
'And the next time you see her,
you say, is the following Tuesday?

21:34.600 --> 21:37.400
After the bank holiday Monday.'
'Indeed.'

21:37.440 --> 21:39.880
'At Victoria Coach Station.'
'That's right.'

21:39.920 --> 21:42.600
'You say she'd not told you anything
about what had happened,

21:42.640 --> 21:46.520
but was there anything that struck
you as unusual about her? Her mood?'

21:46.560 --> 21:50.040
'Yes, she was odd...quiet.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.680
She said er...

21:53.720 --> 21:55.520
What was it? Something like...'

21:56.320 --> 22:00.000
It was the most awful weekend,
Chris. Really dreadful.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.840
I need a drink.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.080
'Which was very unusual.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.040
She almost never drinks.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.600
I remember she asked
for a port and brandy.'

22:11.640 --> 22:13.640
Port and brandy?

22:13.680 --> 22:18.440
Er, yes. Port and brandy.
For the nerves.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.800
Shot of brandy,
shot and a half of port.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.960
Right.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.080
OK. Port and brandy.
And what did you have to drink?

22:27.120 --> 22:30.920
Erm...well, I didn't want a drink.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.600
I had a cup of tea. Earl Grey.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.960
So, you go up to the house
the next weekend...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.160
week after Susan first went up,

22:39.200 --> 22:41.400
she having said nothing
that whole week,

22:41.440 --> 22:44.760
about having killed her parents.
About her mother killing her father.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.880
About her killing her mother, then.
She was provoked.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.000
Provoked. So you say.
So, SHE says.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.040
So you both say. Very neat.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.040
Look...

22:53.080 --> 22:54.800
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend

22:54.840 --> 22:58.280
I don't know it's a defence...
provocation.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.200
"Loss of control" you call it now,
I believe.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.640
Reducing murder to manslaughter.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.720
You've done your homework!
It's good I have.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.640
You've just arrested my wife
for murder,

23:07.680 --> 23:10.320
whereas in truth
all she's ever done is suffer.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.760
And I don't think anyone should
go to prison for that, do you?

23:13.800 --> 23:17.040
And as for that night - no, no,
she couldn't have shot them both,

23:17.080 --> 23:20.280
because she couldn't have done
anything to hurt her father.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.360
I know her.
I know her better than you.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.560
He had too much power over her.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.480
Trouble is, it looks to us
like your in-laws

23:32.520 --> 23:36.200
were both shot from a similar angle,
perhaps by the same person.

23:37.560 --> 23:41.880
Well, I don't know anything about
that, but Susan didn't lie to me.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.600
OK. Let's get back to you, then,
Mr Edwards.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.440
That following Friday, you both
take the coach up to Mansfield.

23:50.480 --> 23:54.240
That is correct. The Friday,
right after I finished work.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.920
And she still hasn't told you?
I'm getting to that.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.880
It wasn't until we arrived
at the house.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.000
First, we picked up fish and chips.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.520
We always have fish and chips
on Fridays.

24:03.560 --> 24:07.880
It's just when I'm tucking in that
Susan starts to act a bit different

24:07.920 --> 24:09.840
and suddenly she says
something like -

24:09.880 --> 24:13.480
I can't stand it any more.
They haven't gone away.
They're upstairs.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.600
And I'm,
"What are they doing upstairs?

24:15.640 --> 24:17.720
Why don't they come down
and say hello?"

24:17.760 --> 24:19.240
Something like that.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.080
And then I don't remember
the exact words

24:21.120 --> 24:23.600
but then she says something like...
Because they're dead.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.640
And I'm, you know...

24:26.680 --> 24:28.160
"What do you mean?"

24:28.200 --> 24:31.160
It's a surreal...disbelief thing.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.400
I lose all interest
in my haddock and chips.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.760
And I love haddock and chips.
It's my favourite.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.200
A big deal, then?

24:37.240 --> 24:39.720
Well, I've not had a single bite
of haddock since that day.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.040
Strictly cod.
Isn't there a smell?

24:43.200 --> 24:45.360
What? Ah, you mean a fish smell?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.880
It was warm that week. We checked.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.240
Yeah, but it was night
when we ate our fish and chips.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.120
The point is that the bodies
would've been lying there for days.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.240
Forgive the unpleasant image -
they're your in-laws after all -

24:56.280 --> 24:58.480
but there would've been
quite a stench.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.000
Ah. I er... Yes, well, I know.

25:02.040 --> 25:06.680
That's one of the er...
But, no, I didn't smell it.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.960
But Susan... Susan said...

25:11.720 --> 25:14.160
Or, well, later I think she said

25:14.200 --> 25:17.120
that there had been an awful smell.

25:17.160 --> 25:23.160
But, no, I didn't...
notice it at the time...myself.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.400
Hard to explain, really.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.080
Except, of course,
that the house always smelt

25:30.120 --> 25:33.240
overwhelmingly of cigarettes
because of her parents.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.400
Sandra!

25:52.160 --> 25:53.880
Sandra!

25:53.920 --> 25:56.280
There you are.
You're looking for me?

25:56.320 --> 26:00.160
Oh. Yes, sir. Sorry.
Why you apologising?
I hear you've found something good.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.760
Just make it quick.
We're in the middle of interviews.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.720
I spent the morning
at the branch in town.

26:04.760 --> 26:06.640
In the archive room.
Oh, bank archives.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.360
The glamour never stops, does it?
Yeah! It won't stop. Um...

26:10.400 --> 26:11.920
But, yeah -
Excuse me.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.600
Er, this is a bank statement
for a joint account.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.480
Susan Edwards
and Patricia Wycherley.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.280
Right. And if you look over here...

26:18.320 --> 26:20.400
that's the date
the account was opened.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.280
This is good, Sandra.
This is very good. Come with me.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.920
Come here! Fuck's sake!
I'm not gonna eat ya'!

26:31.160 --> 26:34.800
'First of all, Susan,
I'd like to introduce you
to Officer Sandra Winters.'

26:34.840 --> 26:35.920
Hello.

26:35.960 --> 26:39.280
Officer Winters is a member of
our Forensic Financial Department.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.840
Oh, my husband's an accountant!

26:40.880 --> 26:45.440
Can you look at this bank document,
please? Police Item CKA-04, Sandra.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.080
Do you recognise that?

26:49.120 --> 26:53.440
That's a bank account statement
showing the joint account you opened
in your name and your mum's.

26:53.480 --> 26:56.000
Can you read the date there, please?
Left-hand side.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.560
5th of May.
5th of May, 1998.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.040
So, talk me through it.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.760
You kill your mother.
Your father's dead as well.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.320
You dispose of the gun and then
first thing Tuesday morning,

27:07.360 --> 27:10.280
after the bank holiday -
9:17am to be specific -

27:10.320 --> 27:13.440
you transfer a bank account
into you and your mother's names

27:13.480 --> 27:15.080
and withdraw almost half the funds.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.720
In cash.
In cash.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.680
Yes, I... I...can't remember.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.960
You don't need to remember.
It's all there in the document.

27:27.360 --> 27:30.840
Well, yes, as I say,
she's been er...

27:30.880 --> 27:35.440
Sometimes she's simply
economical with the truth.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.080
We all are sometimes.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.480
But this... This is difficult.

27:39.520 --> 27:43.440
It's straight after the killings.
It's obscene. It's mercenary.

27:43.480 --> 27:47.160
And, to be honest with you,
it's a little bit daft.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.800
Well, I think
she was obviously very -
It's not confusion, Chris, is it?

27:50.840 --> 27:52.960
Bang, bang, open a bank account.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.840
Well, yes, I...

27:57.920 --> 28:00.840
You said the word, I suppose.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.120
Mercenary. But...

28:06.000 --> 28:09.080
Is there something
you're not telling us, Chris?

28:09.840 --> 28:11.640
Something that could help Susan?

28:11.680 --> 28:15.720
Because at the moment,
this doesn't paint
a very pretty picture, does it?

28:25.080 --> 28:26.640
It's...

28:28.240 --> 28:30.120
It's a very personal matter.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.080
Personal?

28:32.120 --> 28:33.920
I'll tell you what's personal.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.760
Being shot in your own house,
kept under the bed for a week

28:36.800 --> 28:39.360
and buried in your own backyard
for 15 years.

28:44.240 --> 28:48.200
I'd like it on record
that I don't think it's very fair

28:48.240 --> 28:52.000
what I've just said about Susan -
or rather what you said.

28:53.360 --> 28:58.520
It does her a grave disservice
to call her "mercenary".

28:58.560 --> 29:00.200
Why?

29:01.440 --> 29:05.640
Because Susan has always had...

29:07.440 --> 29:10.600
..much bigger things to worry about
than money.

29:37.680 --> 29:41.920
Right. Clean sheets on yesterday,
in case you're wondering.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.200
Here's a towel. Toothbrush.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.640
Thank you.
Are you sure this is all right?

29:46.680 --> 29:48.960
Yeah, of course, yeah.
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.440
Is your mum OK?

29:53.840 --> 29:55.640
Yeah, she's fine.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.960
She's er...

29:58.000 --> 30:00.320
She's not very well at the moment.

30:01.280 --> 30:05.880
Well, I had a very good time
with you tonight, Susan.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.040
Me, too.

30:08.080 --> 30:11.040
Have a good sleep
and I'll see you in the morning.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.920
Good night.
Good night, Chris.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.040
You OK for coffee?

30:37.080 --> 30:39.880
Everything's good, Mum. Thanks.
It's very nice.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.480
Eggs aren't her strong suit.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.080
It was so nice of her
to cook for us.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.800
Oh...

30:50.400 --> 30:52.840
I'm sorry. I really should go.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.440
All right.

30:54.480 --> 30:57.120
Thank you.
All right, then?

30:57.160 --> 30:59.000
Both done?

31:00.400 --> 31:02.640
Oop! Oh, silly me.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.200
You going already, Susan?

31:06.240 --> 31:09.880
I'm sorry. I've had a lovely time.
Thank you for your hospitality.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.160
And you're walking her back.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.600
Lovely. Chivalry lives!

31:15.520 --> 31:17.960
Separate rooms and everything.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.640
Christopher, I know I embarrass you.

31:20.680 --> 31:24.360
But I was right about
the dating agency, wasn't I, hmm?

31:24.400 --> 31:28.040
It was my idea.
Might even give it a go myself.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.480
It was very nice to meet you.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.240
You too, Susan.

31:33.280 --> 31:37.000
And hopefully,
we'll be seeing each other again.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.720
OK.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.080
Look, maybe we should
just say goodbye here.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.920
Oh.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.160
All right, then. Goodbye.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.280
Bye.
Bye.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.600
You've met MY mother!

32:10.640 --> 32:13.720
You're embarrassed of me!
They're just old-fashioned!

32:13.760 --> 32:15.680
Maybe next time!

32:45.840 --> 32:47.760
Can you let me in?

32:47.800 --> 32:50.000
Mum?

32:50.040 --> 32:52.920
Dad, please, can you let me in?
I can explain.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.680
Sorry to keep you waiting, Susan.
I know it's been a long day already.

34:53.720 --> 34:57.480
What we need now are your words
on exactly what happened that night.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.800
Chris can't really tell us,
because er...

34:59.840 --> 35:01.880
according to you both,
he wasn't there.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.320
Only you were there.

35:03.360 --> 35:06.920
Now, you say that your mother
shot your father.

35:06.960 --> 35:10.040
That's not something
that happens every day, is it?

35:10.080 --> 35:12.560
So the obvious question...is why?

35:12.600 --> 35:14.560
No comment.
Oh.

35:16.480 --> 35:20.000
I thought you were feeling a bit
more comfortable talking to us.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.200
What happened, Susan?

35:22.240 --> 35:25.080
Was there an argument or
disagreement between them?
No comment.

35:25.120 --> 35:28.640
What did you feel when you saw your
father there, dead on the floor?

35:28.680 --> 35:31.600
Your mother having shot him.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.480
I felt terrible.
Terrible.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.240
That's a normal reaction, Susan.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.440
But what do you do
- with that emotion?
- No comment.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.480
Do you confront your mother?
No comment.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.240
What's she say to you?
These questions have to be answered.

35:42.280 --> 35:44.400
They DON'T have to be answered.
That's not true.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.080
But this is a horrible event,
isn't it?

35:46.120 --> 35:49.480
Two people shot dead.
Your own parents.
This is what I mean by bait.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.720
But it's not a full explanation
to say you're simply "provoked".

35:52.760 --> 35:55.200
People are gonna provide
their own answers if you don't.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.640
You don't have to say anything.
No comment.

35:58.600 --> 36:02.200
The bank account you opened
the day after the killings, Susan.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.720
The pensions you collected,
the sale of the house,

36:04.760 --> 36:06.400
all those debts you had to cover.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.120
That feels like a slightly better
explanation, doesn't it -

36:09.160 --> 36:11.880
to someone who wasn't there -
that this really was about money?

36:11.920 --> 36:15.240
After all, you'd not
seen your parents for over a year,

36:15.280 --> 36:17.280
you say, and then suddenly
you pay them a visit.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.120
And then they die.
But it wasn't, as I said -

36:19.160 --> 36:20.720
We've just been with your husband.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.400
Do you know what word he used
to describe your behaviour

36:23.440 --> 36:25.000
with that bank account?

36:25.040 --> 36:26.680
Mercenary.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.440
And, I'm sorry, but I'm inclined
to think a jury would agree.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.400
He wouldn't say that.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.360
It might be useful for my client -
It's on tape, Susan.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.720
Chris told us
something else as well, Susan,

36:38.760 --> 36:42.840
that I'd like to ask you about
if you're comfortable with it.

36:42.880 --> 36:46.040
He said that your mother
told you something that night

36:46.080 --> 36:48.400
that you didn't know.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.000
What did your mother
tell you that night?

36:52.840 --> 36:54.720
She said um...

36:55.840 --> 36:57.840
She said um...

37:03.320 --> 37:05.040
Sorry.

37:05.080 --> 37:07.520
Must have been very hard
for him to tell you that.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.320
Can I just... I'm sorry -
It's OK, sir, I'll explain.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.120
I know how hard it is.

37:12.160 --> 37:15.080
But it'll be better for -
I just said, I'll explain it.

37:18.680 --> 37:22.320
Even while I was sleeping,
I was aware of shouting,

37:22.360 --> 37:24.120
some sort of row.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.000
But that was nothing unusual
in that household, not at all.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.520
And as I told you,
I had been drinking a little...

37:30.560 --> 37:33.600
a little more than normal.
I... I don't normally drink.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.080
'I don't know what time it is.
Maybe 2:00am.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.840
And I've been woken by these bangs.'

37:41.880 --> 37:45.160
'How many bangs?'
'Er... I dunno. I was asleep.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.400
Two, maybe? Or just one.
Definitely not three.'

37:48.440 --> 37:50.400
'One or two?'
'Yes.'

37:51.600 --> 37:54.040
And I know immediately
that my father's dead.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.760
I don't know how I know,
I just know.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.480
And my mum is standing there
with a gun.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.080
There are brass casings
on the floor.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.960
Brass casings?
Yeah, erm, spent bullets, I suppose.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.760
And I can tell she's even more drunk

38:03.800 --> 38:05.280
than she was when I went to bed.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.960
Then I say something like, "What
have you done? You've killed him!"

38:08.000 --> 38:09.880
Something like that.
It was a long time ago.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.720
And she says -
I can't give you the exact words -

38:11.760 --> 38:14.240
but she says something like...
I had to.

38:15.560 --> 38:20.160
I can't take it any more, Susan!
I couldn't look at him.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.720
Something along those lines.
And then she turns on me

38:22.760 --> 38:25.000
and she's actually waving the gun
at me at this point -

38:25.040 --> 38:29.320
God knows why you care, after
everything you've been through,

38:29.360 --> 38:31.320
grubby little man.

38:31.360 --> 38:34.360
Horrible, horrible man.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.640
What a disgusting
piece of work he was.

38:40.360 --> 38:44.040
And then she throws the gun
on the bed somewhere about here,
so I pick it up.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.640
He treated me
as though he was disgusted with me.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.560
Er, sorry, Susan.
Yes?

38:48.600 --> 38:50.480
Why'd you pick up the gun?

38:50.520 --> 38:52.720
Er, it's just, well,
she'd been waving it at me

38:52.760 --> 38:55.120
and she was drunk
and I suppose I was afraid

38:55.160 --> 38:57.040
that she was gonna
pick it up again.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.400
Erm, so anyway, and then she starts
saying that thing.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.840
I hated him.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.440
For years, I hated him.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.440
And I hate you too.

39:10.480 --> 39:14.480
Cos when I look at you,
I know I failed.

39:15.520 --> 39:19.680
I failed you, Susan,
and I know that.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.680
I know what he did to you.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.960
I knew it and I just let it happen.

39:32.840 --> 39:35.440
How do you think I feel about that?

39:35.480 --> 39:39.440
You knew, Mum? You knew?
Look, of course, I fucking knew.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.280
I'm your mother, aren't I?!

39:41.320 --> 39:43.680
He didn't even want me after that!
He couldn't do it.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.320
He couldn't even get it up!

39:45.360 --> 39:47.480
I've spent 15 years
trying to forget what she said

39:47.520 --> 39:49.960
so I can't tell you exactly,
but it was something like that.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.640
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:53.160 --> 39:56.560
I am so sorry, Susan.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.360
I'm not a monster.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.520
I did my best.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.160
We had some good times together,
didn't we?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.120
Even though
you were a difficult child.

40:05.160 --> 40:07.360
All I could think of was,
"I want to call my husband."

40:07.400 --> 40:10.320
I even said,
"We should call Christopher.
He'd know what to do."

40:10.360 --> 40:12.400
Give up, Susan.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.320
You think he's different
but he's not.

40:14.360 --> 40:15.880
He's not gonna help you.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.960
He's the same as all the others.
He's just using you for the sex.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.040
No, Mum! And then I keep crying
and she keeps saying these things.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.880
He doesn't love you!
Just accept it before you get hurt.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.080
Nobody loves you!
Stop! Please stop!

40:27.120 --> 40:29.760
God knows I tried
but it's impossible.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.320
You're impossible to love!
Stop it, Mum! Stop it!

40:32.360 --> 40:36.800
With your miserable little life,
it would be better for all of us
if you'd never been born!

40:40.920 --> 40:44.840
I just want to confirm the
implications of what you're saying.

40:44.880 --> 40:48.560
Are you telling us that your father
abused you as a child?

40:50.000 --> 40:52.040
Yes.
Sexually?

40:52.960 --> 40:54.360
Yes.

40:54.400 --> 40:57.440
And that night you discovered that
your mother had known all along?

40:57.480 --> 40:59.400
Yes.
And you'd never told her?

40:59.440 --> 41:02.160
I was always too afraid
of what my father might do.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.040
I spent my whole life
just trying to wish it away.

41:07.080 --> 41:10.920
Thinking of
all those years after school
when she was at work and he...

41:12.040 --> 41:13.760
And Chris, your husband.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.400
Are you sure
he wasn't involved in the killings?

41:16.440 --> 41:19.840
I only ask because the bullet holes
on your parents' chests

41:19.880 --> 41:21.360
were strikingly similar.

41:21.400 --> 41:24.480
And that bank account,
that looks like a plan.

41:24.520 --> 41:29.360
With all this new information today,
some of which is quite important,

41:29.400 --> 41:31.200
as my colleague is pointing out,

41:31.240 --> 41:35.080
we will be applying for extra
custody time so we can continue.

41:35.120 --> 41:39.040
So, we're just trying to get
everything as clear as possible
before we progress.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.440
Er, I think she's been
pretty clear already, don't you?

41:45.320 --> 41:47.680
Are you sure Chris wasn't involved?

41:49.440 --> 41:51.400
He helped you, didn't he?

41:52.880 --> 41:54.880
He decided to protect you.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.880
Susan?

42:14.080 --> 42:16.400
Course, he did.
He always protects me.

42:18.480 --> 42:20.720
Did he bury the bodies for you?

42:21.520 --> 42:23.520
Yes, he buried the bodies.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.200
He's very practical like that.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.760
He has to be, cos I'm not, you see.
So, he has to be.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.520
Ah, Susan, if you wanted a break -
We couldn't tell the police.

42:31.560 --> 42:34.360
He understood that
so he took control.

42:34.400 --> 42:38.200
And so...this was his idea, then...

42:38.240 --> 42:40.240
to bury the bodies?

42:40.280 --> 42:42.160
Yes, it was his idea.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.680
He did that for me.

42:47.920 --> 42:52.600
He's the only person in the world
that's ever made me feel safe.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.440
We'll get it sorted.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.240
He's not allowed to keep you
out of your own house.

43:26.080 --> 43:28.200
Has he always been like that?

43:32.160 --> 43:34.680
It's OK. You don't have to tell me.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.160
No, I...

43:38.200 --> 43:40.240
I do want to tell you.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.880
What is it?

43:47.720 --> 43:49.480
It's just I've...

43:50.360 --> 43:52.760
I've never told anyone else.

43:56.480 --> 43:59.680
Well, whatever it is...

44:01.360 --> 44:03.760
..it'll be between us.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.680
Just you...and me.

44:37.120 --> 44:39.320
'Susan Edwards had been
at her parents' house

44:39.360 --> 44:41.400
when she was woken by a loud bang.'

44:42.720 --> 44:44.760

her parents' bedroom.'

during which her mother told her
she knew her father had abused her
as a child.'

44:54.960 --> 44:59.160

'Manslaughter.''Manslaughter.'

45:00.080 --> 45:03.640
'She says, killing her mother...'

45:07.520 --> 45:10.320
'The Edwards claim they returned
to the house a week later

45:10.360 --> 45:12.480

Song Contest on television

the elderly couple's bank accounts.'
