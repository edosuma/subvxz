WEBVTT

00:09.718 --> 00:11.971
Henry, come on,

00:09.718 --> 00:11.971
we got to get to school.

00:12.011 --> 00:13.472
Relax. I'm almost done.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.098
You better not make us tardy.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.600
I was born tardy.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.145
My mom says

00:18.310 --> 00:20.145
that's why my feet are so big.

00:21.647 --> 00:22.773
Boom, done.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.316
- What?

00:24.358 --> 00:27.194
I just got tickets

00:24.358 --> 00:27.194
to Valentine's Day at Club Soda.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.278
Shut up.

00:28.612 --> 00:29.404
For real?

00:29.446 --> 00:30.614
Yeah, man.

00:30.656 --> 00:31.866
Well, guess who's going

00:30.656 --> 00:31.866
to be working there?

00:31.907 --> 00:34.284
Wait.

00:31.907 --> 00:34.284
What is Club Soda?

00:34.326 --> 00:36.745
It's this cool new club

00:34.326 --> 00:36.745
just for teens,

00:36.787 --> 00:38.706
and they have every kind

00:36.787 --> 00:38.706
of soda you can think of.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.957
Uh-huh.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.959
And I'm getting paid

00:39.999 --> 00:41.959
five bucks an hour

00:42.001 --> 00:45.004
to guard the door and make sure

00:42.001 --> 00:45.004
only legit teenagers get in.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.883
Well, me and Bianca

00:45.963 --> 00:48.883
are way legit.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.176
Ooh, you're taking Bianca

00:48.924 --> 00:51.176
out on Valentine's Day?

00:51.218 --> 00:52.427
Yeah, I am.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.804
Nice.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.804
How'd you ask her?

00:54.805 --> 00:55.723
I didn't yet.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.018
You better call Bianca

00:57.558 --> 00:59.018
right now.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.227
Why?

01:00.268 --> 01:01.645
Because Valentine's Day

01:00.268 --> 01:01.645
is tomorrow

01:01.687 --> 01:03.898
and girls like to be

01:01.687 --> 01:03.898
asked in advance.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.985
Oh I think I know

01:04.606 --> 01:07.985
how girls work.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.196
- Up top.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.196
- Like a mop.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.742
What does "like a mop" mean?

01:15.158 --> 01:16.577
I don't know,

01:15.158 --> 01:16.577
I shouldn't have said it.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.047
- Boo.

01:28.087 --> 01:30.716
(choking)

01:31.132 --> 01:33.176
Sorry.

01:31.132 --> 01:33.176
I didn't mean to...

01:33.552 --> 01:35.554
That's okay.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.554
Hi.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.848
Hey.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.848
So chickity check it.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.937
Two tickets, you and me,

01:39.182 --> 01:42.937
tomorrow night.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.689
Yeah. Valentine's Day.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.483
That's right.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.570
I'm going to keep saying things

01:49.192 --> 01:51.570
until you smile.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.824
Henry, I can't go with you

01:53.113 --> 01:55.824
to Club Soda tomorrow.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.078
But I bought us tickets

01:56.742 --> 01:59.078
for Valentine's Day.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.288
Well, you should've asked me

01:59.119 --> 02:01.288
a week ago.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.083
Oh, come on.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.083
What?

02:04.541 --> 02:06.752
You, like, wanted me

02:04.541 --> 02:06.752
to officially ask you out?

02:06.794 --> 02:08.587
Yes.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.587
That's how girls work.

02:08.963 --> 02:09.797
(coughing)

02:11.256 --> 02:12.424
Sorry.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.718
I just swallowed

02:12.466 --> 02:14.718
some "told you so."

02:16.595 --> 02:18.097
Come on, Bianca.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.848
Someone else already

02:18.138 --> 02:19.848
asked me to go to Club Soda

02:19.890 --> 02:20.641
tomorrow night.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.892
Who?

02:21.934 --> 02:22.851
Mitch Bilsky.

02:23.936 --> 02:24.937
Mi--

02:24.979 --> 02:26.396
You're--

02:24.979 --> 02:26.396
Wh--

02:26.438 --> 02:29.608
Mitch Bilsky is all big

02:26.438 --> 02:29.608
and mean and stupid.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.359
And Mitch.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.488
Well, he asked me in advance.

02:35.072 --> 02:35.864
Sorry.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.538
Well, Henry Hart.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.874
Or should I call you, Fff.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.503
Why would you call me "Fff"?

02:50.671 --> 02:53.757
Because Fff stands for "F."

02:54.549 --> 02:55.717
I failed my test?

02:56.093 --> 02:57.344
Oh, yeah.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.178
And I was just about

02:57.385 --> 02:59.178
to tape it to your locker.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.179
Why?

03:00.221 --> 03:01.348
To shame you.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.394
Look, Miss Shapen,

03:03.684 --> 03:06.394
I can't get an F.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.480
Well, too late, poop tart.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.816
Okay.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.484
Why have you been

03:10.858 --> 03:12.484
in such a bad mood all week?

03:13.568 --> 03:14.778
I don't have to tell you.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.075
(gasping)

03:20.199 --> 03:22.327
Did nobody invite you out

03:20.199 --> 03:22.327
for Valentine's Day?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.121
Oh, God, it shows?

03:24.705 --> 03:27.833
(crying)

03:27.875 --> 03:29.208
Do you have a tissue?

03:29.793 --> 03:32.671
(crying)

03:32.713 --> 03:33.672
I got a dollar.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.798
Give it.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.802
(sneezing)

03:40.637 --> 03:41.555
Hey.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.475
What if I could get you

03:42.806 --> 03:45.475
a Valentine's date

03:45.517 --> 03:46.852
with Captain Man?

03:48.687 --> 03:50.564
You don't know Captain Man.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.358
True, true.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.195
But if I can find him

03:56.236 --> 03:58.363
and get him to have dinner

03:56.236 --> 03:58.363
with you tomorrow night,

03:59.114 --> 04:00.157
can I re-take the test?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.951
If you get me

04:00.991 --> 04:02.951
a date with Captain Man

04:02.993 --> 04:04.161
for Valentine's Day,

04:04.536 --> 04:06.872
I will take your F

04:07.497 --> 04:09.875
and turn it into one of these.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.919
Okay. I'm going to try.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.378
Henry, wait.

04:13.879 --> 04:14.588
Your dollar.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.682
It all just kind of happened.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.768
My dad was

04:25.724 --> 04:27.768
an irresponsible scientist.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.229
I wanted an after-school job.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.731
(Captain Man)

04:30.270 --> 04:32.731
And by accident,

04:30.270 --> 04:32.731
he made me indestructible.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.899
Ah!

04:33.941 --> 04:36.151
(Henry)

04:33.941 --> 04:36.151
I went into this crazy store

04:36.443 --> 04:38.361
and met

04:36.443 --> 04:38.361
a pretty interesting guy.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.404
I'm going to blow your mind.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.532
(Captain Man)

04:40.321 --> 04:42.532
Now I protect

04:40.321 --> 04:42.532
the good citizens of Swellview

04:42.574 --> 04:43.533
who call me...

04:43.575 --> 04:44.618
(Henry)

04:43.575 --> 04:44.618
And he turned out to be...

04:44.659 --> 04:45.619
You know the name.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.746
Captain Man! That's right,

04:45.660 --> 04:47.746
Henry.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.457
(Captain Man)

04:47.788 --> 04:50.457
In time, I realized

04:47.788 --> 04:50.457
that being a superhero

04:50.498 --> 04:52.042
is a lot to handle alone.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.085
He wanted some help.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.628
(Captain Man)

04:53.127 --> 04:54.628
I needed a sidekick.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.213
(Henry)

04:54.669 --> 04:56.213
I, Henry hart...

04:56.255 --> 04:57.714
(Captain Man)

04:56.255 --> 04:57.714
Pledge to never ever ever...

04:56.255 --> 04:57.714
tell anyone...

04:57.756 --> 04:59.466
That I'm Captain Man's

04:57.756 --> 04:59.466
secret sidekick.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.383
It is done.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.718
(Henry)

05:00.425 --> 05:01.718
Now we blow bubbles.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.053
(Captain Man)

05:01.760 --> 05:03.053
And fight crime.

05:03.095 --> 05:03.804
(Henry)

05:03.095 --> 05:03.804
Feels good.

05:05.180 --> 05:09.851
(music)

05:18.526 --> 05:20.570
Up the tube!

05:21.613 --> 05:22.489
(Henry)

05:21.613 --> 05:22.489
Oh, my boot.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.324
(Captain Man)

05:23.115 --> 05:24.324
Ha!

05:31.123 --> 05:32.124
Are you kidding me?

05:33.374 --> 05:34.960
That's your teacher,

05:33.374 --> 05:34.960
Miss Shapen.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.629
My single teacher.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.464
Oh, I'm so surprised.

05:40.799 --> 05:41.842
Come on.

05:41.883 --> 05:42.926
If you have dinner with her,

05:42.968 --> 05:44.261
she'll change

05:42.968 --> 05:44.261
my "F" into an "A."

05:44.303 --> 05:45.386
- Hey, I got a good idea.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.763
What?

05:46.805 --> 05:47.514
Why don't I have Valentine's

05:46.805 --> 05:47.514
dinner with your mom?

05:47.555 --> 05:48.389
No!

05:48.431 --> 05:49.308
All right.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.434
I'll have dinner

05:50.309 --> 05:51.434
with Miss Shapen.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.561
Yes!

05:53.603 --> 05:55.438
Ooh and she loves chicken,

05:53.603 --> 05:55.438
so feed her some chicken.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.731
All right.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.566
Ray, I will never forget this.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.526
Neither will I.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.573
Hey, look at me.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.573
I'm Mr. Varlintine's.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.909
Ew.

06:07.951 --> 06:08.910
- That is bad.

06:07.951 --> 06:08.910
- Yikes.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.705
That's what

06:10.329 --> 06:11.705
you're wearing for Gerta?

06:11.746 --> 06:14.833
Oh, yes.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.833
Gerta will love this.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.044
Who's Gerta?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.504
His Valentine's date,

06:17.085 --> 06:19.504
who's actually a...

06:20.714 --> 06:21.506
Hey, Schwoz!

06:21.548 --> 06:22.381
What?

06:23.091 --> 06:25.260
Our friend Henry here

06:23.091 --> 06:25.260
waited until today

06:25.302 --> 06:26.928
to ask a girl

06:25.302 --> 06:26.928
out for Valentine's.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.890
What?

06:27.346 --> 06:29.890
That's not how girls work.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.474
I know that now.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.977
So, why don't you let Henry

06:34.019 --> 06:35.562
take Gerta out

06:34.019 --> 06:35.562
for dinner tomorrow night?

06:36.395 --> 06:37.564
Me take Gerta?

06:37.605 --> 06:39.774
No way.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.774
Gerta is for Schwoz only.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.485
Come on, just lend her

06:40.317 --> 06:42.485
to Henry for one night.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.696
This conversation is weird.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.907
You don't understand.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.907
Just call Gerta in here.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.325
Sure.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.618
Gerta,

06:50.660 --> 06:53.580
(speaking foreign language)

06:59.961 --> 07:03.173
(speaking foreign language)

07:03.215 --> 07:04.091
Gerta.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.011
I'm pretty sure

07:05.717 --> 07:08.011
she's not my type.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.596
She's not a she.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.471
And I'm out of here.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.432
(Ray)

07:11.014 --> 07:12.432
Just relax.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.434
Gerta is an android.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.144
A fancy robot.

07:16.186 --> 07:16.937
She's...

07:18.521 --> 07:19.439
That's a machine?

07:20.190 --> 07:20.857
Show the kid.

07:22.984 --> 07:23.860
Gerta.

07:23.902 --> 07:27.322
(speaking foreign language)

07:36.331 --> 07:36.998
(speaking foreign language)

07:40.919 --> 07:42.754
That's the coolest thing

07:40.919 --> 07:42.754
I've ever seen.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.797
(laughing)

07:43.838 --> 07:45.424
You ain't seen nothing yet.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.716
Really?

07:46.758 --> 07:48.385
What's she going

07:46.758 --> 07:48.385
to pull off next?

07:49.510 --> 07:51.888
No. Gerta is

07:49.510 --> 07:51.888
a shape-shifting android.

07:51.930 --> 07:52.680
Show him.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.399
Okay, shut up.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.399
That did not just happen.

08:02.441 --> 08:03.400
Did that just happen?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.278
Hi. My name's Delilah.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.029
Well, hey there, Delilah.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.324
(Both)

08:09.114 --> 08:10.324
Eh?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.119
So, I can take her

08:11.825 --> 08:14.119
to Club Soda tomorrow night

08:14.161 --> 08:15.578
and no one will know she's fake?

08:16.663 --> 08:17.831
I'm not fake, Henry.

08:18.706 --> 08:19.499
I love you.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.043
Well, I love you, too.

08:23.711 --> 08:26.298
And, dude,

08:23.711 --> 08:26.298
you take her to the club,

08:26.340 --> 08:28.091
it'll make Bianca

08:26.340 --> 08:28.091
so jealous.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.968
Yeah.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.011
Ooh, wait.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.346
Wait for what?

08:32.387 --> 08:34.348
If I'm going to make

08:32.387 --> 08:34.348
Bianca jealous,

08:34.389 --> 08:35.556
let's really go for it.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.391
Meaning?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.101
High school girl.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.227
And she's got to be all, like--

08:39.269 --> 08:40.520
I know what to do.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.281
Well,

08:48.987 --> 08:51.281
happy Valentine's Day to me.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.621
Happy Valentine's Day.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.041
Welcome to Club Soda.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.084
Happy Valentine's Day.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.086
Welcome to--

09:06.213 --> 09:08.382
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:08.423 --> 09:10.758
There's too much talking

09:08.423 --> 09:10.758
in the line!

09:11.885 --> 09:14.513
Now, just have your IDs

09:11.885 --> 09:14.513
and tickets ready to show me.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.973
Okay?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.973
I'm in charge!

09:18.392 --> 09:19.518
Welcome to Club Soda.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.395
Happy Valentine's Day.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.814
Hey, what up, dog?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.814
Happy V-day.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.442
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.361
What?

09:29.403 --> 09:31.779
You got to be

09:29.403 --> 09:31.779
at least 13 to get in.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.032
Well, we're all 14.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.245
Wrong. I know Piper.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.245
You're all nine.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.998
Oh I'm not Piper.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.543
My name is Judy Glickman.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.004
This ID is fake, Judy.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.091
Okay, are you going

09:49.256 --> 09:51.091
to make this a thing?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.510
Sorry, kid.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.510
Rules are rules.

09:53.843 --> 09:54.553
You better not--

09:57.805 --> 09:59.224
Unh!

10:01.351 --> 10:02.727
Come on, girls.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.065
I'm still in charge!

10:09.150 --> 10:10.818
Welcome to Club Soda.

10:10.860 --> 10:11.945
(Jasper)

10:10.860 --> 10:11.945
Happy Valentine's Day.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.654
Welcome to...

10:14.030 --> 10:14.781
Oh, hey, Char.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.116
Hey, dude.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.075
(Jasper)

10:16.157 --> 10:17.075
I didn't know

10:16.157 --> 10:17.075
you were coming here.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.577
I wasn't planning to

10:18.618 --> 10:20.245
until Henry told me

10:18.618 --> 10:20.245
about his date.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.746
Who, Bianca?

10:22.247 --> 10:23.457
(Jasper)

10:22.247 --> 10:23.457
She's already

10:22.247 --> 10:23.457
in there with Mitch.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.458
(glass breaking)

10:24.499 --> 10:25.833
(tires screeching)

10:30.171 --> 10:31.881
Henry found himself

10:30.171 --> 10:31.881
another date.

10:31.923 --> 10:32.591
Who?

10:32.632 --> 10:33.883
I said all I can say.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.636
Okay.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.636
Do you have a ticket?

10:36.677 --> 10:38.054
Well,

10:36.677 --> 10:38.054
Nope.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.014
Charlotte?

10:40.640 --> 10:45.103
(music)

10:45.145 --> 10:46.104
Hey, dude!

10:47.272 --> 10:48.189
Dude!

10:53.736 --> 10:54.862
What can I get you?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.906
Soda.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.906
Two cherry lime devils.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.164
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:05.081 --> 11:05.790
These are for me.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.544
Oh, hey, Bianca.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.462
Oh, hi, Charlotte.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.172
Hey, Mitch.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.717
So, did Henry come with you?

11:16.759 --> 11:18.970
Nah. He's...

11:26.853 --> 11:30.106
(music)

11:54.172 --> 11:57.133
Man, I should buy her a soda.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.073
I just can't believe

12:17.362 --> 12:20.073
she's not a real person.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.701
Tiffany,

12:22.741 --> 12:24.118
show her how many different

12:22.741 --> 12:24.118
colors you can make your eyes.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.711
Okay, okay.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.711
Be normal.

12:37.340 --> 12:37.965
Dang it.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.467
What?

12:39.509 --> 12:40.759
How can I make Bianca jealous

12:40.801 --> 12:41.928
if she won't

12:40.801 --> 12:41.928
even look over here?

12:44.222 --> 12:46.182
Why don't you take Tiffany

12:44.222 --> 12:46.182
out on the dance floor?

12:46.224 --> 12:46.849
Show off a little?

12:46.891 --> 12:47.850
Ooh, that's good.

12:49.269 --> 12:49.894
Wait.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.146
Maybe you should check

12:50.478 --> 12:52.146
with Ray or Schwoz

12:52.188 --> 12:53.814
to make sure she can

12:52.188 --> 12:53.814
dance like a normal person.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.983
No offense.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.402
I'm Tiffany.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.987
I'll call them.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.907
(phone beeping)

13:03.991 --> 13:04.992
Yeah, Henry, what's up?

13:05.034 --> 13:07.078
I need to know

13:05.034 --> 13:07.078
if Tiffany can dance.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.162
Pfft.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.997
She's a highly

13:08.204 --> 13:09.997
sophisticated android.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.417
She can do anything,

13:10.039 --> 13:12.417
dance, fly a plane,

13:13.084 --> 13:14.753
she's good with puppets.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.630
Cool.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.590
Hey, are you on your way

13:16.671 --> 13:18.590
to pick up my teacher?

13:18.632 --> 13:21.008
No. I sent Gooch

13:18.632 --> 13:21.008
to get her and bring her here.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.219
What? You can't bring her down

13:21.050 --> 13:23.219
into the man cave.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.472
You said we always have

13:23.261 --> 13:25.472
to keep the location a secret.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.889
She won't know anything.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.058
Gooch picked her up,

13:26.931 --> 13:29.058
put her in a sack,

13:29.100 --> 13:30.435
and he's going

13:29.100 --> 13:30.435
to send her down here when--

13:30.477 --> 13:31.603
(beeping)

13:31.645 --> 13:33.229
(screaming)

13:33.271 --> 13:33.980
(grunting)

13:36.650 --> 13:37.942
She's here.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.942
I've got to go.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.027
(Henry)

13:38.693 --> 13:40.027
Hey, make her happy.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.780
I need her to change

13:40.069 --> 13:41.780
my "F" into an "A".

13:41.820 --> 13:44.157
Yeah, blah, blah.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.157
Bye bye.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.492
And give her some chicken.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.743
Yeah, chicken.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.869
(moaning)

13:51.164 --> 13:53.291
Ooh.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.884
Well, hello, Captain Man.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.346
Hello.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.515
So...

14:08.556 --> 14:10.016
You're going to stand there

14:08.556 --> 14:10.016
looking handsome

14:10.057 --> 14:11.768
or are you going to help me

14:10.057 --> 14:11.768
out of the sack?

14:14.729 --> 14:16.105
Oh, hey, is that chicken?

14:16.147 --> 14:17.357
Yes.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.862
(music)

14:44.759 --> 14:45.760
Can you dance like that?

14:45.802 --> 14:46.927
No.

14:47.762 --> 14:48.971
You should take some lessons.

15:05.446 --> 15:09.200
Uh... can I get you another

15:05.446 --> 15:09.200
entire chicken?

15:10.993 --> 15:13.204
Nah. I can still chew

15:10.993 --> 15:13.204
a little more off of this one.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.835
♪ Baby, baby, you take me back ♪

15:18.877 --> 15:21.170
♪ There, I said it, I said it

15:18.877 --> 15:21.170
I said it, I said it ♪

15:21.212 --> 15:22.963
♪ Oh, baby, baby ♪

15:23.715 --> 15:25.508
Oh, I'm sorry,

15:23.715 --> 15:25.508
I didn't know you had company.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.843
No, no.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.843
Please stay.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.178
Please.

15:29.721 --> 15:30.430
Come meet Miss Shapen.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.556
Sharona.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.016
Right. Sharona Shapen,

15:31.972 --> 15:34.016
Schwoz Schwartz.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.476
Schwoz Schwartz,

15:34.058 --> 15:35.476
Sharona Shapen.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.563
Nice to meet you.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.023
Anyone mind

15:38.979 --> 15:41.023
if I take off my shoe?

15:41.065 --> 15:42.567
Actually,

15:41.065 --> 15:42.567
please don't take off your--

15:42.609 --> 15:44.318
Oh!

15:46.529 --> 15:47.822
That is a big toe.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.299
Thanks.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.299
Thank you.

16:06.674 --> 16:07.341
How you doing, Bianca?

16:08.426 --> 16:09.969
Okay, thanks.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.144
'Sup, baby.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.897
I know you're not talking to me.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.023
Nope.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.985
I'm talking

16:23.065 --> 16:25.985
to this sweet thing right here.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.571
Hey.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.571
She's not a thing.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.072
She kind of isShh.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.492
Want to dance?

16:33.785 --> 16:35.161
You came here with Bianca.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.288
It's not polite

16:35.202 --> 16:37.288
to dance with another girl.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.750
It's not polite for me to dance

16:37.330 --> 16:40.750
on you face, either.

16:41.167 --> 16:44.044
Well, lucky for you,

16:41.167 --> 16:44.044
my face isn't a floor.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.215
I'll be on the dance floor

16:49.676 --> 16:50.802
whenever you're ready.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.807
Okay, that guy is just evil.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.726
Yeah.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.726
He is pretty evil.

16:59.059 --> 16:59.978
Evil?

17:00.770 --> 17:01.813
Evil.

17:08.862 --> 17:09.654
Where's she...

17:09.696 --> 17:10.989
(Henry)

17:09.696 --> 17:10.989
Tiffany?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.574
Hey, hey, here she comes.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.574
Get out of here.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.664
Oh, okay, yeah.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.664
No, I can get down with that.

17:20.957 --> 17:21.958
Here we go.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.127
Here, give me your hand.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.087
Aah!

17:30.008 --> 17:32.802
That is a crazy dance.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.347
- Hah!

17:40.685 --> 17:44.605
So...

17:40.685 --> 17:44.605
I have this sore on my back.

17:45.899 --> 17:46.983
A sore?

17:47.025 --> 17:48.484
- Uh-huh.

17:48.526 --> 17:52.154
Maybe one day you can drive me

17:48.526 --> 17:52.154
down to the wound clinic.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.197
(phone rings)

17:53.239 --> 17:54.281
I got to take this!

17:55.282 --> 17:56.116
Well, who is it?

17:56.158 --> 17:56.910
It doesn't matter.

17:57.660 --> 17:58.327
(phone rings)

18:04.918 --> 18:05.835
Hey, kid, what's up?

18:08.462 --> 18:10.590
Ray, listen.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.590
Tiffany's gone crazy.

18:10.631 --> 18:11.591
What?

18:10.631 --> 18:11.591
What's she doing?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.218
Aah!

18:15.720 --> 18:18.138
She's tossing Mitch Bilsky

18:15.720 --> 18:18.138
around like a big bag of fudge.

18:19.682 --> 18:23.185
I don't want to dance anymore.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.273
She's going

18:26.022 --> 18:27.273
to really hurt him.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.026
Ray, how do I stop her?

18:30.068 --> 18:31.193
You just have to press

18:31.235 --> 18:33.153
a small red button

18:31.235 --> 18:33.153
on the back of her neck.

18:33.195 --> 18:33.947
Got it.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.659
(crashing sound)

18:39.285 --> 18:40.202
What are you going to do?

18:40.703 --> 18:42.371
(People)

18:40.703 --> 18:42.371
Ooh!

18:42.830 --> 18:43.831
Where are you going?

18:43.873 --> 18:45.249
(People)

18:43.873 --> 18:45.249
Ooh!

18:48.461 --> 18:51.047
(laughs)

18:57.428 --> 19:00.014
Maybe I'll just sit down

18:57.428 --> 19:00.014
in here for a little while.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.352
Help me!

19:08.272 --> 19:09.983
Look, it's Kid Danger!

19:10.441 --> 19:11.317
(applause)

19:13.235 --> 19:15.362
I love you, Kid Danger!

19:15.404 --> 19:16.697
He's so dreamy.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.583
Hen--

19:25.247 --> 19:27.583
Kid Danger, be careful!

19:34.715 --> 19:36.801
Thanks.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.801
Thank you.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.388
Obviously this girl

19:38.302 --> 19:41.388
has severe anger issues.

19:42.473 --> 19:43.474
She really does.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.935
Right.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.395
So, I'm going

19:45.977 --> 19:48.395
to take her to therapy.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.899
(cheering)

19:59.866 --> 20:01.492
Well,

19:59.866 --> 20:01.492
I better go back to my date

20:03.285 --> 20:04.286
and her toe.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.584
(laughing)

20:12.294 --> 20:13.629
What's going on?

20:13.671 --> 20:16.174
Oh, I'm just going

20:13.671 --> 20:16.174
to take a little trip

20:16.215 --> 20:17.216
with your boss.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.720
My boss? Schwoz is not--

20:17.967 --> 20:20.720
My boss, Schwoz.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.221
Yes, okay.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.598
He's going to take me

20:22.262 --> 20:24.598
to the wound clinic.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.808
They love her there.

20:26.684 --> 20:27.643
I've heard.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.063
Happy Varlintine's Day.

20:32.857 --> 20:33.941
Up the tubes!

20:33.983 --> 20:35.484
(screaming)

20:46.746 --> 20:48.206
There's no saving this chicken.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.427
Hey, guys.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.803
Long line for the bathroom.

21:03.554 --> 21:04.346
What happened?

21:05.014 --> 21:06.599
That girl

21:05.014 --> 21:06.599
you brought here, Tiffany.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.934
Yeah?

21:07.975 --> 21:09.643
She went crazy

21:07.975 --> 21:09.643
and beat up Mitch Bilsky.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.939
But then Kid Danger

21:10.519 --> 21:12.939
showed up and took her down.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.149
What?

21:16.067 --> 21:17.151
Yep.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.820
Wow.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.820
Yeah, I mean, I thought...

21:23.449 --> 21:25.076
You look really great tonight.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.828
You have the prettiest eyes.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.999
Okay, I'm going to go

21:28.495 --> 21:31.999
stand somewhere else now.

21:34.127 --> 21:34.877
Cool.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.338
So...

21:38.380 --> 21:40.716
You want to go out with me

21:38.380 --> 21:40.716
for Valentine's next year?

21:43.844 --> 21:45.096
It's a date.

21:46.931 --> 21:47.890
Wait.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.268
What?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.728
You can't kiss me.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.728
I'm still on a date with Mitch.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.772
I wasn't going to kiss you.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.566
I was going to bite your nose.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.694
- Hey!

22:00.736 --> 22:02.571
Quit biting my date's nose!

22:02.947 --> 22:03.823
(chuckles)

22:33.393 --> 22:34.187
(Ding)

22:34.228 --> 22:35.146
Mmm..
