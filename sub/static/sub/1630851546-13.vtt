26:15.399 --> 26:17.227
I said run!

26:17.401 --> 26:18.751
What are you doing?

26:18.925 --> 26:19.752
Trust me, I'm doing this
for us, okay? Run.

There's more destruction coming.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.254

28:11.428 --> 28:12.778

and get on the table.

Get on the table.
Will you lie down?

29:05.004 --> 29:06.309
Yeah, yeah, okay.

29:06.483 --> 29:07.876
Is everything okay?

29:10.574 --> 29:11.750
What's going on?

29:14.317 --> 29:15.971
What? Okay. Ah...

29:16.145 --> 29:17.756
Just hold still, please.

29:19.583 --> 29:22.717
Ah, ah. Oh...

this is a new shirt. [shouts]

[door opens]

29:42.389 --> 29:43.738
It's pretty bleak out there.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.871
Um, how many people are dead?

29:46.045 --> 29:47.698
Neighborhoods near Main Street
got hit the worst.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.396
Lily's Flowers, the bookstore,
they're gone.

29:49.526 --> 29:50.353
How many people are dead?

29:50.527 --> 29:51.354
ACE:
Not a one.

29:51.528 --> 29:52.703
No casualties.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.096
Turns out, the siren works.

29:54.270 --> 29:56.359
Yeah, still a lot of people
who need help, though.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.405
Food, shelter.

29:58.535 --> 29:59.449
GEORGE:Yeah, Nick's gonna
open the Youth Center,

29:59.623 --> 30:00.886
we'll put out blankets and cots.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.409
Me and Ace are gonna
empty the freezer

30:02.539 --> 30:04.977
and we'll start cooking.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.674
We could use some help
if you're up for it.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.939
Just gonna go
with George and Nick.

30:16.075 --> 30:19.339
Why did you hesitate
at the Veil?

30:19.513 --> 30:20.775
You said you were doing this
for us. What does that mean?

30:20.906 --> 30:22.864
Nothing.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.561
I've never killed
someone before,

30:24.735 --> 30:26.041
so if I was hesitating,
that's why.

30:42.666 --> 30:43.450
RYAN:
There you go.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.887
Icarus Hall is all yours.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.758
Leaving that place to me
in her will?

30:47.933 --> 30:49.282
That might have been
the craziest thing

30:49.456 --> 30:50.239
Temperance ever did.

30:50.413 --> 30:51.806
[door closes]

30:51.937 --> 30:53.373
CARSON:
Sad news.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.463
Looks like the world
just lost a lawyer.

30:56.593 --> 30:59.422
George returned
all the books I loaned her.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.163
GEORGE:
Why?

31:01.337 --> 31:03.557
Because I'm not chasing
stupid prelaw anymore.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.124
The night the Veil opened,

31:05.298 --> 31:07.082
legal arguments didn't
save lives, my crowbar did.

31:07.256 --> 31:09.128
Judge Abbott hasn't
been calling Carson

31:09.302 --> 31:11.173
because he wants to
mentor a crowbar.

31:11.347 --> 31:14.481
The world needs more
lawyers like George Fan.

31:14.611 --> 31:15.917
His words and mine.BESS:
Okay, I need advice.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.179
Unsolicited?

31:17.353 --> 31:19.181
Nancy's got plenty.

31:19.355 --> 31:21.880
So, I have been invited
to be the next Keeper

31:22.054 --> 31:23.707
and run the Historical Society.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.492
And you want to turn it down?

31:25.622 --> 31:27.711
Turning it down?

31:27.842 --> 31:30.410
We've just had
a supernatural tsunami.

31:30.584 --> 31:31.672
The town needs me
more than ever.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.587
No, uh,

31:33.761 --> 31:35.937
I wanted advice on what shoes
to wear my first day.

31:37.243 --> 31:38.635
Flats.

31:38.809 --> 31:41.769
Well, that was priceless.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.075
All right, Drew.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.641
Leave the books.

31:44.772 --> 31:46.426
I'll give them a spin.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.086
Smells good, Pete.

31:54.216 --> 31:55.696
Thanks, man. Jambalaya.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.611
Hmm, jambalaya.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.221
Well, well, well.
Does Florida know

31:59.395 --> 32:00.483
how much luggage
you're bringing?

32:00.657 --> 32:03.530
Uh, not my luggage.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.662
Change of plans.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.229
I'm going to Florida next month,

32:07.403 --> 32:10.145
because this month,
Florida came to me.

32:12.408 --> 32:16.804
My parents are outside, giving
their cab driver life advice.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.024
How did you convince them to...?

32:19.198 --> 32:20.764
Oh, I didn't.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.549
My dad heard about
the tsunami,

32:22.723 --> 32:24.203
and he called.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.683
They wanted to see
what they could do to...

32:26.857 --> 32:28.120
I don't know,
help clean up my home.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.773
Besides,

32:29.948 --> 32:31.993
I couldn't leave today.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.777
I got to interview dishwashers.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.562
Ace just gave us his notice.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.482
NANCY:
Hello?

33:00.979 --> 33:02.589
If you're breaking
into the morgue,

33:02.719 --> 33:04.591
you don't need to steal
my I.D., I'll just...

33:04.721 --> 33:06.027
let you in.

33:08.247 --> 33:10.075
You got a job at the morgue.

33:10.249 --> 33:12.816
That night at the Veil...

33:15.254 --> 33:16.777
...I saw myself
through your eyes,

33:16.951 --> 33:18.866
and what I saw was lacking.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.912
No direction
or purpose.

33:22.087 --> 33:27.048
Just fear...
disguised as anything but.

33:27.179 --> 33:30.051
Ace...Wait, uh, no,
this is good news.

33:30.225 --> 33:32.488
Because by the time
that I figured that out,

33:32.619 --> 33:37.102
this apartment opened up
on the floor below Nick's.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.802
And I lined up a job
that I really love.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.024
I'm not lacking anymore.

33:46.198 --> 33:49.070
You never were.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.598
I've missed you.

34:00.734 --> 34:02.823
You've been avoiding
me for a month.

34:04.781 --> 34:06.696
Mm-hmm.

34:06.870 --> 34:10.048
At The Claw, you'd leave
as soon as I show up.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.877
I couldn't figure out why.

34:17.142 --> 34:19.100
Can I tell you
what I hoped the reason was?

34:22.712 --> 34:24.236
It was becauseyou felt

34:24.366 --> 34:27.369
as strongly about me
as I do about you.

34:27.543 --> 34:30.938
But for some reason, you're
afraid to tell me that.

34:31.112 --> 34:34.159
If that's all it was,
then I can-- I'll just tell you,

34:34.333 --> 34:36.857
that there's...Nothing to be afraid of.

34:42.993 --> 34:45.605
I shouldn't have come here.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.433
Nancy, wait.

34:47.607 --> 34:48.695
Listen to me.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.610
We are friends.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.133
And those feelings
that you have for me,

34:52.307 --> 34:53.787
I do not share them
and I never will.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.789
I don't believe you.

34:55.963 --> 34:56.703
T-There's something
else going on.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.270
Are you in trouble?Why?

34:58.400 --> 34:59.401
Because I'm telling you
something

34:59.575 --> 35:00.315
you don't want to hear?

35:02.622 --> 35:04.841
Look through my eyes right now.
What do you see?

35:12.806 --> 35:14.112
NANCY:
I think lower.

35:15.635 --> 35:16.462
Lower.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.159
Higher?

35:18.333 --> 35:20.335
Perfect.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.385
You're right.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.779
It's perfect.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.663
Get out of here, I'll be fine.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.578
Uh, we can finish
the rest later.

35:45.752 --> 35:47.841
Are you sure? I've got time.Yeah.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.235
If there's anything
else you need to hang,

35:50.409 --> 35:51.497
or talk about?

35:54.978 --> 35:56.110
[exhales]

35:56.241 --> 35:58.112
What if I told you
that in order

35:58.286 --> 36:00.375
to save the town,
I gave up control of my fate?

36:00.549 --> 36:02.551
And I lied to the man
that I love

36:02.682 --> 36:04.031
to save his life?

36:04.205 --> 36:05.163
And now I have to spend
the rest of mine

36:05.337 --> 36:07.774
paying this terrible price?

36:07.948 --> 36:09.993
I'd say...

36:11.560 --> 36:14.824
...there's so much in life
we can't control,

36:14.998 --> 36:16.609
but there's so much we can.

36:16.783 --> 36:20.265
And sometimes, things
aren't as bad as they seem.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.267
This time, it is.

36:24.530 --> 36:26.140
It's like, it's like
when Mom got sick,

36:26.314 --> 36:27.402
and there was nothing
we could do to make her better.

36:27.576 --> 36:28.403
It's like that.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.144
Okay, well...

36:31.189 --> 36:33.060
I don't regret trying.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.064
And I don't regret loving her,

having to lose her.

was your soul mate.

And she was.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.428
She was.

36:55.169 --> 36:57.302
So that being the case,

36:57.476 --> 36:59.304
why will I get in that car
with Jean?

37:00.957 --> 37:03.264
