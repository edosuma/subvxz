Balki, I have great news!

01:29.613 --> 01:31.448
What is all this?

01:31.482 --> 01:33.954
Cousin, you know
it’s mama’s soon.

01:33.988 --> 01:37.227
And I want to get her
really special birthday present
this year.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.264
So, I had to get
a part‐time job.

01:39.298 --> 01:40.868
I’m a bear stuffer!

01:40.902 --> 01:42.872
[audience laughing]

01:42.906 --> 01:45.745
And this is my bear‐stuffing
jamboree!

01:47.616 --> 01:49.920
‐[sarcastically] That’s great.
‐Well, it’s better than great.

01:49.953 --> 01:53.628
It’s fun, it’s wacky and it’s
not as easy as it looks.

01:53.661 --> 01:57.636
You have to pay attention
every second.
For instance,

01:57.669 --> 02:01.275
one of these bears has
half of my Snickers bar in it.

‐Balki!
‐Yes, yes, it’s hard work

02:07.856 --> 02:10.995
but it’s worth it knowing that
I’m bringing joy
to little children.

02:11.027 --> 02:14.301
All right, Balki, forget about
bringing joy to little children.

02:14.334 --> 02:19.478
I have got us a part‐time job
that is going to make us rich!

02:19.512 --> 02:24.088
This afternoon
I interviewed L. Bob Frederick,

02:24.121 --> 02:28.698
President and CEO
of Clean For Life.

02:28.731 --> 02:32.605
Get out of the city!
I know who’s L. Bob Frederick.

02:32.638 --> 02:35.043
He was on the cover
of Cheez Whiz magazine!

Balki, L. Bob Frederick
told me that he finally found
in me...

02:48.938 --> 02:53.146
A salesman who could sell
their Clear For Life
Home Hygiene System.

02:53.179 --> 02:54.649
You’re not gonna believe
this stuff, Balki.

02:54.683 --> 02:57.087
This... is a miracle!

02:57.889 --> 02:58.991

to stuff yourselves for a while.

the lean in clean.

03:13.788 --> 03:16.425
It puts the spark in sparkle.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.630
Does it put the hiney in shiny?

03:18.663 --> 03:20.466
[audience laughing]

03:21.603 --> 03:22.872
Yes, it does.

03:26.814 --> 03:31.055

looks an awful lot
like a bottle of soap.

I think it’s all cleared up

03:42.746 --> 03:47.487
Balki, when you look
at this bottle of soap
you see a bottle of soap.

03:47.521 --> 03:51.228
‐That is correct.
‐When I look at this bottle
of soap

03:51.262 --> 03:54.736
I see cars,
yachts, beach houses!

It’s getting bigger...

Balki, this miracle product
combined with this marvel
of technology, the Omni‐Sweep,

04:27.134 --> 04:31.108
will revolutionize
the way we think of dirt.

04:31.142 --> 04:35.952
You know, when I think of dirt
I think of the floor
in Mama’s kitchen,

an omelet off it.

I’m not gonna ride
the Clean For Life gravy train
without you.

we’re going to be partners?

‐You take the sixty.

making huge sums of money

05:16.766 --> 05:19.672
we’ve got to go over
the finer points of selling.

what would you like to know?

05:28.858 --> 05:34.134
I already know everything
there is to know about selling.

05:34.168 --> 05:39.144
I stayed up all night reading
the Clean For Life handbook,

05:39.178 --> 05:42.919
"Knock Knock, I’m There."
[audience laughing]

05:46.325 --> 05:50.834
"A Guide
to Door‐to‐Door Selling",

You are not ready for the book.

05:59.251 --> 06:01.890
I want to read the book.

06:01.924 --> 06:06.198
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Balki, if it were up to me

06:06.232 --> 06:07.568
I would let you see the book,

06:07.601 --> 06:13.948
but L. Bob gave explicit
instructions not to let
you see the book.

06:13.981 --> 06:17.521
He said that it contains
mind‐control information which,

06:17.555 --> 06:20.026
in the wrong hands,
could be dangerous.

you need to know about selling.

06:25.170 --> 06:30.380
Now, there are two basic rules
to selling.

and get the money,
get the money, get the money.

06:39.064 --> 06:41.202

to be four rules.

However, I’m not allowed
to read the book!

you don’t need to read the book,

L. Bob said that everything
you need to know about selling

06:54.595 --> 06:58.537
is printed on this little card.

06:58.570 --> 07:02.511

I was allowed to read the card?

‐Did...

this little outburst proves

‐that you are not ready
to read the book.
‐I’m fine.

I think maybe by the time
we go once around
the neighborhood,

I’ll have the hang
of this door‐to‐door selling.

once around the neighborhood.

10:50.032 --> 10:51.603
‐No?
‐No.

10:51.636 --> 10:54.675
And I mean no.

10:54.709 --> 10:58.349
Balki, in this neighborhood,
we could go to a thousand doors
and make one sale.

and makes a thousand sales.

‐Yes.
‐Never heard of her.

11:16.686 --> 11:18.957
Well, I have.
I interviewed her last month.

She owns the Dumont
chain of hotels.

the Queen of Clean.

salesman history.

get the money, get money.

rules two through four.

12:23.987 --> 12:26.726
Maybe it’s explained
in the book.

However,
I’m not allowed to see the book.

about my art collection.

to do a follow‐up piece.

is the portrait I’m having

14:08.095 --> 14:11.368

14:16.813 --> 14:19.519
And what was the basis
of his friendship with Fred?

14:19.552 --> 14:22.758
They had absolutely nothing
in common.

14:22.791 --> 14:27.166
‐[audience laughing]
‐Renaldo Ricardo
is a world‐famous artist.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.406
He’s painted all the members
of the Royal Family.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.145
And when he finishes
with this one,

14:33.178 --> 14:38.321
it will hang in the portrait
gallery of the Chicago
Art Institute.

14:40.894 --> 14:44.233
‐What a beautiful painting!
‐[chuckles]

14:44.267 --> 14:48.141
Oh, Cousin,
this guy is really good!

14:48.175 --> 14:50.847
You can’t even see
any of the numbers.

14:50.881 --> 14:52.016
[audience laughing]

14:53.118 --> 14:56.391
[laughing embarrassingly]

14:56.425 --> 15:01.503
[clears throat] Mrs. Dumont,
uh, we are not here
about the painting

15:01.536 --> 15:06.613
We are here to sell
you a miracle product.

15:06.646 --> 15:12.089
‐I beg your pardon?
‐"Hello, busy homemaker.

15:12.123 --> 15:16.498
We’re here to make
your housecleaning chores
a joy and a pleasure.

15:16.533 --> 15:18.135
May we come in?

15:21.576 --> 15:23.446
Get foot in door."

15:23.479 --> 15:25.415
[audience laughing]

15:29.257 --> 15:30.894
I’m telling L. Bob.

15:30.927 --> 15:32.396
[audience laughing]

15:32.429 --> 15:34.033
[both grunting]

15:37.474 --> 15:38.610
[both] Hi.

15:41.181 --> 15:46.057
Mrs. Dumont, we represent
the Clean for Life
Home Hygiene System.

15:46.091 --> 15:52.369
We have over two hundred
varieties of cleaners and spot
and stain removers. Balki.

15:52.403 --> 15:57.046
Hello, busy homemaker.
We’re here to make
your housecleaning chores a joy.

15:57.079 --> 15:59.685
Give me the bottle.
Give me the bottle.

15:59.719 --> 16:01.623
‐Oh.
‐[nervous chuckle]

16:01.656 --> 16:05.664
It’s as simple
as shake and shine.

16:05.697 --> 16:10.339
I’m sure with three hotels
you use a lot
of cleaning products.

16:10.372 --> 16:11.676
Look, you’ll have to excuse me,

16:11.709 --> 16:13.178
I don’t have time
for any of this,

16:13.211 --> 16:15.551
‐and please leave my house.
‐Wait, wait, wait.

16:15.584 --> 16:18.355
‐You, you don’t want
to buy anything?
‐No!

16:18.388 --> 16:24.000
No! Did you hear that, Cousin?
Oh, boy, this is great!

16:24.033 --> 16:27.073
This no means yes stuff
is really starting
to make sense to me.

16:27.106 --> 16:29.512
When do we get our money,
get our money, get our money?

16:29.545 --> 16:31.314
‐[audience laughing]
‐[grumbling]

16:32.383 --> 16:35.657
[chuckling nervously]

16:35.691 --> 16:40.065
Mrs. Dumont, uh, if you would
just give a us a moment to show
you some of our‐‐

16:40.099 --> 16:41.101
[shouts]

16:42.336 --> 16:45.209
The maid will clean it up!
Don’t be here when I get back!

16:52.001 --> 16:55.676
‐Let’s get outta here.
‐Cousin, no. We made this mess,
we got to clean it up.

16:57.213 --> 17:00.819
Balki, that’s a brilliant idea!

17:00.853 --> 17:03.792
Well, Cousin,
I, I can’t take all the credit.

17:03.825 --> 17:07.031
You yourself said we were going
to clean up in here.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.435
[audience laughing]

17:08.469 --> 17:12.277
No, Balki, I mean
this is a golden opportunity
to show Mrs. Dumont

17:12.310 --> 17:15.015
exactly what the Clean For Life
system is all about.

17:15.048 --> 17:19.656
When she gets back, we’ll have
this place spotless!
Bring me the Omni‐Sweep.

17:19.691 --> 17:22.597
I think this calls
for Solvent Number Nine!

17:25.703 --> 17:29.777
Balki, this will be as simple
as shake and shine!

17:29.811 --> 17:32.150
‐Cousin, just a second‐‐
‐I don’t have time,
I don’t have time for this.

17:32.183 --> 17:35.389
‐Cousin, no, no, no,
listen to me.
‐I met with L. Bob Frederick.

17:35.423 --> 17:39.197
I read the book.
I know what I’m doing.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.837
Fine.
‐[audience laughing]

17:49.016 --> 17:51.755
‐I suppose you were going
to tell me to tighten the cap.
‐Yes.

17:51.788 --> 17:54.026
[audience laughing]

17:54.060 --> 17:56.131
But perhaps that
wasn’t covered in the book.

17:56.165 --> 17:58.469
[audience laughing]

18:02.343 --> 18:05.082
Oh, God!
I hope we didn’t hurt it.

18:05.116 --> 18:07.887
Oh, now, now, Cousin,
look, don’t fly off
your love handles,

18:11.228 --> 18:17.072
Cousin, the wall is fine.
Lucky for us, the Ricardo
painting was in the way.

18:17.106 --> 18:19.144
[audience laughing]

18:19.177 --> 18:21.815
All right, Balki,
I hope we didn’t ruin
the painting.

18:21.848 --> 18:23.252
Just,
just help me take this off.

18:27.227 --> 18:28.895
[both sigh in relief]

18:28.929 --> 18:34.241
That was close. All right,
I’ll just clean up the carpet
and then we’re outta here.

18:34.274 --> 18:38.149
Boy, Mrs. Dumont must have
had this little mole removed
after the painting was done.

18:38.182 --> 18:40.786
‐What mole?
‐Little mole right over here.

18:43.259 --> 18:47.066
Balki, that’s not a mole!
It’s a spot of cleaning fluid!

18:47.099 --> 18:50.439
[hyperventilating]
Oh, okay, all right!
Don’t panic!

18:50.473 --> 18:52.977
[audience laughing]

18:53.010 --> 18:57.187
All right, all right, all right.
Balki, okay, okay, okay.
All right, all right.

18:57.220 --> 19:03.332
I’ll just carefully remove
the little speck
of cleaning fluid.

19:04.867 --> 19:06.405
[audience laughing]

19:08.942 --> 19:11.481
Oh, God! I took off
the end of her nose!

19:11.515 --> 19:13.985
[panting]

19:16.124 --> 19:19.163
Well, if you ask me, Cousin,
it looks a whole lot better,

19:19.197 --> 19:21.368
‐[audience laughing]
‐We gotta fix it!

19:21.401 --> 19:23.205
[gasping]

19:26.545 --> 19:29.484
[humming]

19:31.154 --> 19:35.162
Cousin, Cousin, Cousin, Cousin.
Articulate the cartilage.

19:35.196 --> 19:37.367
[audience laughing]

19:37.400 --> 19:41.541
Now, get, get in there
with some highlights.

19:41.575 --> 19:44.080
Some highlights.
Uh, Some highlights.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.991
And some, some, uh,
some shadow, shadow.

19:50.025 --> 19:52.029
[audience laughing]

19:52.062 --> 19:54.601
‐What do you think?
‐It stinks.

19:54.634 --> 19:57.640
All right, all right,
here, here.
I’ll just...

20:00.346 --> 20:04.454
‐Ooh!
‐Oh... God!

20:04.487 --> 20:07.327
I made it worse!
[shouts] All right,
what are we gonna do?

20:07.360 --> 20:08.729
‐What are we gonna do?
‐Now listen to me.

20:08.762 --> 20:11.601
‐What are we gonna do?
‐Listen to me, listen to me,
listen to me.

20:13.472 --> 20:15.443
[audience laughing]

20:15.476 --> 20:18.282
‐I can paint, right?
‐Yes, you can.

20:18.315 --> 20:20.986
‐I can fix this, right?
‐Yes, you can.

20:21.020 --> 20:25.729
‐I can save us, right?
‐Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

20:25.763 --> 20:30.273
‐Can I read the book?
‐Okay, all right, all right,
yes, yes, yes!

20:30.306 --> 20:32.510
‐You can read the book!
‐Can you get me
an autographed copy?

20:32.543 --> 20:34.714
Just shut up
and fix the painting!

20:34.747 --> 20:36.385
[audience laughing]

20:36.418 --> 20:38.322
All right,
now first things first.

20:39.491 --> 20:41.728
[audience exclaims in shock]

20:43.832 --> 20:45.736
[audience laughing]

20:50.579 --> 20:53.084
Now, what did she look like?

20:53.118 --> 20:55.122
[audience laughing]

21:01.735 --> 21:03.839
[screaming in shock]

21:03.872 --> 21:06.378
All right, all right, all right.
Now hold it. Just hold it.

21:08.582 --> 21:11.421
Hand down, please.
Hand down, please, and, uh,

21:11.455 --> 21:14.561
give me a little smile.
Give me a little smile.

21:14.594 --> 21:15.629
Just hold that.

21:18.134 --> 21:19.837
[audience laughing]

21:21.608 --> 21:23.211
Hold that.

21:25.316 --> 21:26.585
[audience clapping]

21:38.342 --> 21:40.346
Did your Mama get
the birthday present
you sent her?

21:40.379 --> 21:43.619
Yes, she did.
She loved her
Clean For Life products.

21:45.456 --> 21:48.429
She has the cleanest mud hut
on the island.

21:48.462 --> 21:50.298
[audience laughing]

21:54.240 --> 21:58.248
Well, we better get going.
We don’t want to be late
for Mrs. Dumont’s party.

21:58.281 --> 22:01.721
‐Mmm. [chuckles]
‐She really was
very understanding, wasn’t she?

22:01.755 --> 22:05.596
Oh, yes, she was.
I hope tonight’s party
don’t go too late.

22:05.629 --> 22:09.804
Look at the bright side,
only another six more months
of parking cars...

22:09.837 --> 22:11.875
[audience laughing]

22:13.445 --> 22:15.716
[audience clapping]

22:20.826 --> 22:23.565
...and we’ll have paid off
the carpet and the painting.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.891
[closing theme music playing]
