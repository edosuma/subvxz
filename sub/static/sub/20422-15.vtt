<i>Forever... Forever...</i>

02:20.870 --> 02:24.740
<i>The first day I touched you,</i>

02:25.240 --> 02:29.120
<i>my heart pounded so hard.</i>

02:29.120 --> 02:32.630
<i>So that's why I decided</i>

02:32.630 --> 02:36.760
<i>in my heart to follow you.</i>

02:37.350 --> 02:40.540
<i>The scent of the flowers and wind,</i>

02:41.350 --> 02:44.760
<i>the smell of this soup...</i>

02:45.400 --> 02:48.950
<i>It doesn't matter if they disappear,</i>

02:48.950 --> 02:52.850
<i>as long as I can be with you.</i>

02:53.460 --> 03:08.860
<i>I could hear the sound 
of this tiny hope growing.</i>

03:03.620 --> 03:09.410
<b>A New Journey</b>

03:09.570 --> 03:13.140
<i>I can hear the song of love...</i>

03:13.140 --> 03:15.660
I wish Minori could've come.

03:15.660 --> 03:18.930
She's working at Karashin's place.

03:19.270 --> 03:22.300
Miss Minori is a working lady.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.270
"A working lady"?

03:24.270 --> 03:26.040
Is that something people normally say?

03:35.900 --> 03:36.930
Miss Isuzu,

03:37.320 --> 03:38.270
are you okay?

03:38.630 --> 03:39.680
Are you tired?

03:40.400 --> 03:42.090
No, I'm fine.

03:42.090 --> 03:43.450
I'm full of energy.

03:44.260 --> 03:45.320
Really?

03:45.320 --> 03:46.200
Yeah.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.080
That was really amazing, though.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.840
You really seemed like a pro!

03:51.840 --> 03:53.320
Aw, stop.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.500
The owner was really happy.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.980
He looked like he was glad 
he asked you to do it.

03:57.980 --> 04:00.090
Don't make it sound like such a big deal.

04:00.090 --> 04:02.770
It's basically a once-a-week part-time job.

04:02.770 --> 04:05.390
And the song was just a cover of 
something I heard a long time ago...

04:05.750 --> 04:09.750
But everyone looked truly happy listening to you.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.730
That's right.

04:11.060 --> 04:15.240
Miss Isuzu is such a great artist, 
she must have a muse.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.830
Give it a rest.

04:16.830 --> 04:18.940
That was nothing.

04:18.940 --> 04:22.990
I just know a little bit because I've always had 
instruments in my house since I was little.

04:23.510 --> 04:26.880
Your sweet melodies bring life 
to the city streets at night,

04:26.880 --> 04:31.500
and your dazzling voice brings peace to 
the hearts of even birds and beasts.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.970
Honestly, Rudy...

04:36.730 --> 04:40.280
What's wrong with saying it was great, 
when it was great?!

04:40.280 --> 04:41.720
Shut up, Rudy!

04:41.720 --> 04:43.100
What's wrong with it?

04:43.270 --> 04:45.400
What's wrong with it?!

04:46.120 --> 04:47.720
<b>First Order of Knights of the People of the Land
Drill Guidelines</b>

04:48.450 --> 04:49.810
A quest?

04:50.100 --> 04:53.460
Yes, I plan to send Tohya and 
the other new members on it.

04:53.850 --> 04:56.530
And I'd like Serara to go, too.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.820
If she's okay with it, that's just fine with me.

05:00.410 --> 05:01.810
But what quest?

05:02.780 --> 05:03.570
This.

05:04.610 --> 05:06.070
A magic bag?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.100
Yes.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.320
Dazaneg's Magic Bag.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.910
I want them to get the materials for it.

05:12.140 --> 05:15.560
Oh, "Get the Magic Bag," right?

05:15.560 --> 05:17.630
The one where you hunt the mini-wyverns.

05:18.930 --> 05:22.790
They've reached the minimum 
level required for it.

05:24.030 --> 05:25.260
I see.

05:25.260 --> 05:27.530
They're already above level 45.

05:28.270 --> 05:33.390
Tohya seems to want to go. 
He keeps bringing it up.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.360
I'm sure they want one.

05:36.690 --> 05:38.740
It's convenient, since it holds everything.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.440
I don't think that's all it is.

05:42.820 --> 05:47.480
I think they actually want to try 
a real quest, all by themselves.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.250
But will they be okay on their own?

05:54.270 --> 05:55.530
Excuse me.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.810
I thought you might be tired.

05:59.810 --> 06:01.580
Thanks.

06:01.580 --> 06:04.010
Are you done working at Karashin's place?

06:04.310 --> 06:05.120
Yes.

06:06.010 --> 06:07.090
Thanks.

06:07.090 --> 06:09.010
Oh, great timing, actually.

06:24.020 --> 06:27.730
<i>Everyone complimented me, 
but I'm not that good.</i>

06:28.350 --> 06:30.740
<i>It's always been my friend...</i>

06:31.590 --> 06:35.550
<i>No one ever told me my music was bad.</i>

06:36.070 --> 06:38.460
<i>But no one ever told me it was good, either.</i>

06:39.420 --> 06:43.360
<i>But even if I can't be a pro like you, Dad,</i>

06:43.360 --> 06:46.550
<i>I can at least play the lute once in a 
while to blow off steam, right?</i>

06:48.260 --> 06:49.090
<i>Because...</i>

06:53.810 --> 06:56.730
<i>It makes everyone happy.</i>

06:58.510 --> 07:00.990
Why are you grinning like that?

07:00.990 --> 07:01.750
Huh?

07:02.920 --> 07:05.490
No way... I was grinning?

07:05.490 --> 07:06.890
You were.

07:06.890 --> 07:09.950
You still feel great after that concert, huh?

07:11.540 --> 07:12.450
I guess.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.720
Me, too.

07:14.720 --> 07:19.550
I never imagined myself on 
the stage, playing drums.

07:19.550 --> 07:21.200
You were really good.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.460
Aw, you're flattering me.

07:22.850 --> 07:25.710
Anyway, bards are amazing.

07:25.710 --> 07:32.090
You have an aura that makes even someone 
like me able to play, just by being near you.

07:32.970 --> 07:37.010
But you know, it seems you need 
musical sense for it to work.

07:37.470 --> 07:40.100
I tried asking Rudy, but...

07:41.860 --> 07:43.950
How's this, Miss Isuzu?

07:43.950 --> 07:45.000
It's great, right?

07:45.540 --> 07:46.610
How about this?

07:47.840 --> 07:50.110
Oh, my God! My hand's stuck!

07:48.830 --> 07:50.110
I can imagine...

07:50.530 --> 07:55.620
But that just means you have 
really good musical sense.

07:55.890 --> 07:57.380
That's not true.

07:57.380 --> 08:00.510
I've just been used to music 
ever since I was a kid.

08:00.510 --> 08:01.560
You know...

08:02.510 --> 08:03.630
I played soccer.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.560
I practiced a lot,

08:07.210 --> 08:09.840
but I was no match for the guys 
who were really good.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.580
You can tell when someone's a natural.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.790
Even when you're a kid.

08:16.250 --> 08:20.330
But even if I sucked, it was fun.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.810
You have fun playing music, too, right?

08:26.340 --> 08:27.750
Yeah.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.270
You like it, right?

08:29.580 --> 08:30.280
Yeah.

08:30.830 --> 08:33.320
And you get to keep doing it, so it's great!

08:40.990 --> 08:45.160
Do you remember what happened just 
after we were saved from Hamelin?

08:46.900 --> 08:50.930
We stayed with the Crescent 
Moon Alliance for a while,

08:51.670 --> 08:55.800
but you two had already decided 
to come to this guild, right?

08:56.630 --> 09:03.310
But I was suddenly free, 
and I had no idea what to do.

09:06.550 --> 09:09.820
And then I found this lute.

09:11.040 --> 09:15.320
With the dolphin pattern lacquered on... 
It was so beautiful.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.790
I knew it was something Marielle 
had made long ago,

09:19.790 --> 09:22.020
so I asked her to let me have it.

09:25.950 --> 09:28.460
And then I made a bunch of adjustments,

09:28.460 --> 09:32.840
and now it's my own personal instrument, 
the Flying Dolphin.

09:33.260 --> 09:34.740
Thanks to this, I...

09:34.740 --> 09:36.200
Well, how to say it...

09:36.730 --> 09:38.850
It gave me the drive to keep going.

09:39.660 --> 09:43.470
I'm happy I can keep playing music.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.690
Tohya?

09:48.690 --> 09:49.840
Isuzu?

09:51.300 --> 09:52.730
Oh, Minori?

09:52.970 --> 09:54.040
You're back.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.230
Tohya! Isuzu!

09:57.680 --> 09:59.490
Shiroe wants to talk to us.

10:06.300 --> 10:07.350
A journey!

10:07.350 --> 10:09.500
An adventure! A quest!

10:09.500 --> 10:12.020
<b>Mt. Fuji                                                    Akihabara</b>

10:09.940 --> 10:13.640
The Redstone Mountains are near Nagano, right?

10:12.020 --> 10:15.510
<b>Redstone Mountains</b>

10:13.640 --> 10:15.510
Mountains, rivers, forests!

10:15.840 --> 10:18.260
And villages we've never been to!

10:18.490 --> 10:22.300
Tohya, stop staring at the map, 
and pack two more pairs of underwear.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.490
There's no room for all that.

10:25.490 --> 10:28.270
We don't have our magic bags yet.

10:28.640 --> 10:33.310
If you want to know about traveling, 
ask me, Rundel Haus Code.

10:33.310 --> 10:37.230
That's right, you used to travel alone.

10:37.230 --> 10:37.980
Indeed.

10:37.980 --> 10:40.630
Until partway, I was with other adventurers,

10:40.630 --> 10:43.330
but I came all the way from Bogport 
to Akihabara on my own.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.470
So I have plenty of experience.

10:46.040 --> 10:46.910
Huh?

10:48.940 --> 10:49.940
What's wrong?

10:49.940 --> 10:52.190
My very important brush is missing!

10:52.190 --> 10:55.120
I can't maintain my appearance 
as an adventurer without it!

10:55.120 --> 10:58.100
My elegant, flowing hair!

10:59.300 --> 11:00.530
Rudy?

11:00.530 --> 11:02.040
Here.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.900
It's in your toiletries set.

11:04.890 --> 11:06.070
Miss Isuzu!

11:06.070 --> 11:07.930
You're so wonderful!

11:08.300 --> 11:11.150
Come on, clean all this up.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.320
You guys ready?

11:15.860 --> 11:17.730
We're in perfect shape, Master!

11:17.730 --> 11:18.880
Good.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.180
Put a barrel of water on the carriage.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.320
We know.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.100
Okay, good.

11:27.510 --> 11:29.550
Making progress, everyone?

11:29.550 --> 11:31.330
Wh-When did you get in...

11:31.510 --> 11:32.290
You little—

11:32.290 --> 11:36.770
If you want any advice from me, just ask.

11:36.770 --> 11:39.870
I'm an idol who travels the whole galaxy!

11:40.320 --> 11:42.300
I told you to get off me!

11:42.300 --> 11:43.950
Oh, come on, Naotsugu...

11:43.950 --> 11:46.380
You know you love it—

11:46.880 --> 11:47.720
I do not!

11:54.870 --> 11:57.180
What's with everyone?

11:57.520 --> 11:59.770
They're worried about us.

11:59.770 --> 12:03.430
They really care about us a lot, huh?

12:03.430 --> 12:05.900
Everyone always looks out for us.

12:06.180 --> 12:10.650
Yeah, but they try not to let 
us know they're doing it.

12:14.560 --> 12:18.760
It's kind of tiring, knowing they're 
looking out for us all the time.

12:20.450 --> 12:23.340
Hey, want to bet on who comes next?

12:23.660 --> 12:25.120
Nyanta!

12:25.570 --> 12:26.670
I think it'll be Shiroe—

12:26.670 --> 12:27.760
Preparations going well?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.180
You win.

12:32.700 --> 12:33.720
Is something wrong?

12:33.720 --> 12:34.900
N-Nothing.

12:35.410 --> 12:39.530
Um, I think we'll be done packing soon.

12:39.530 --> 12:42.030
Then we'll split up and go shopping,

12:42.030 --> 12:43.530
pick up a carriage and weapons...

12:44.670 --> 12:47.500
Nyanta's going to come and 
help us choose a carriage.

12:47.790 --> 12:48.790
I see.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.100
I made this. It's a little more detailed.

12:56.230 --> 12:57.100
Bye!

12:59.230 --> 13:02.470
Okay, let's finish here and go shopping.

13:02.470 --> 13:03.360
Yeah!

13:07.710 --> 13:09.930
Hey, stop staring at the map.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.940
<b>Amenoma</b>

13:16.970 --> 13:17.940
Welcome.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.440
Hi, there!

13:21.570 --> 13:24.200
Once we have weapons, then we'll need armor.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.950
We'll have to make a few more stops.

13:30.090 --> 13:32.050
I can tell you're a samurai!

13:32.050 --> 13:34.040
You look great with a katana.

13:34.740 --> 13:37.490
I wanted to take this opportunity 
to get a new one,

13:37.490 --> 13:41.460
but at my level, there aren't 
too many I can use...

13:43.770 --> 13:45.350
How about caltrop?

13:46.270 --> 13:49.100
Don't you think trying a ninja's 
weapon would be interesting?

13:49.560 --> 13:50.970
Looking for weapons?

13:50.970 --> 13:53.220
Akatsuki brought me along with her.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.100
You could go with shurikens, too.

13:57.100 --> 14:02.720
Yeah, shurikens are a choice for a ranged weapon 
that can be used regardless of class.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.990
Kunai are valuable ones, too.

14:04.990 --> 14:07.990
I'd recommend the ones on the wall there.

14:07.990 --> 14:10.400
They're easy to use in a variety of situations.

14:08.310 --> 14:09.990
Oh, um...

14:10.400 --> 14:12.740
Well, no matter how good your weapon is,

14:12.740 --> 14:15.690
in the end, it's all about your heart and body.

14:15.690 --> 14:19.470
Listen! When the time comes, a man 
needs to put his body on the line.

14:19.470 --> 14:20.000
Right!

14:20.000 --> 14:21.530
I know, Master!

14:22.310 --> 14:27.510
And when even that's not enough, 
remember this! Pant—

14:35.480 --> 14:37.520
So cute!

14:36.040 --> 14:37.520
<b>Please do not blow the flutes inside the store!</b>

14:37.780 --> 14:40.480
These flutes are the ones that summon horses.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.280
But wow, look at all the animals you can summon.

14:44.280 --> 14:47.020
Everything from dangerous beasts to pets.

14:48.010 --> 14:52.280
Ew! You can summon rats and snakes, too.

14:52.610 --> 14:55.780
What about the griffon? The one Shiroe has?

14:56.130 --> 15:00.210
You need to do a special quest to get those,

15:00.210 --> 15:02.550
for things like a griffon or pegasus.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.110
A pegasus, huh?

15:06.110 --> 15:08.250
I want a pegasus.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.050
If I could ride on one with him...

15:10.550 --> 15:11.290
Meow.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.070
<i>A pegasus?</i>

15:14.070 --> 15:15.080
<i>That's right.</i>

15:15.570 --> 15:19.440
<i>I risked my life on a quest to get it for you.</i>

15:20.500 --> 15:22.940
<i>You're so wonderful, Nyanta!</i>

15:23.160 --> 15:24.980
<i>We'll ride it together.</i>

15:24.980 --> 15:26.570
<i>Call it.</i>

15:27.100 --> 15:28.050
<i>Okay!</i>

15:29.850 --> 15:31.070
No!

15:30.570 --> 15:31.830
No way!

15:40.260 --> 15:43.440
There are actually a lot of different 
types of carriages, aren't there?

15:44.400 --> 15:46.200
Wow!

15:46.200 --> 15:48.050
This one looks really tough!

15:48.310 --> 15:52.210
It has fire, cold, and electricity 
resistances at rank 80.

15:53.230 --> 15:54.800
I want this one!

15:56.600 --> 15:58.560
But it's expensive, right?

16:04.340 --> 16:04.930
Here.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.480
Let's go see the next one, Tohya!

16:18.590 --> 16:20.280
That's kind of weird-looking.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.850
Well, the people who make 
these are quite hardcore.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.110
This is it!

16:25.950 --> 16:28.820
This gorgeous, fit-for-a-celeb feeling...

16:28.820 --> 16:32.550
It's truly the perfect carriage for me, 
a noble and great adventurer!

16:32.550 --> 16:35.760
It's as though it was made just for me!

16:38.380 --> 16:40.390
<i>This doggy is all screwed up.</i>

16:47.640 --> 16:50.650
Well, this looks like a reasonable choice.

16:50.950 --> 16:52.530
Yeah, it looks good.

16:52.740 --> 16:53.910
Yep.

16:55.020 --> 16:57.140
You have excellent taste.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.830
It's simple, but the chassis and suspension 
are made in an interesting way.

17:01.830 --> 17:05.260
It's lightweight but tough, and the gyration 
radius of the front wheels—

17:05.260 --> 17:07.920
But it's expensive, right?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.920
Leave the negotiations to me.

17:11.380 --> 17:16.320
Nyanta showed me this great ramen place...

17:16.320 --> 17:19.010
I'll do what I can.

17:19.010 --> 17:20.430
All right!

17:31.650 --> 17:34.980
Does that taste good, Danish? Croissant?

17:35.950 --> 17:38.210
Those names sound like something 
Serara would think up.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.980
Want to give them cabbage, too, Isuzu?

17:41.980 --> 17:43.910
Sure, I do.

17:44.220 --> 17:45.800
You, too, Rudy.

17:47.630 --> 17:50.390
That is no longer amusing to me.

17:50.390 --> 17:54.550
Just so we're clear, I'm a pro at handling horses.

17:55.460 --> 17:56.750
Come on!

17:56.750 --> 17:59.540
They're our companions from now on, after all!

18:01.500 --> 18:04.990
Now, now, you shouldn't 
scream like that, Miss Isuzu

18:04.990 --> 18:06.560
Horses are easy to spook.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.710
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.320
Apologize properly.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.940
I-I'm sorry!

18:14.190 --> 18:15.950
You apologize, too.

18:16.330 --> 18:17.810
Why do I—

18:19.000 --> 18:20.320
Forgive me...

18:20.320 --> 18:21.950
Forgive me, horsey!

18:21.950 --> 18:23.190
Okay!

18:23.190 --> 18:24.450
It's done!

18:27.800 --> 18:28.820
I like it.

18:28.820 --> 18:30.170
It's cool.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.920
I'll draw a picture to finish it off!

18:35.570 --> 18:37.220
J-Just a giraffe...

18:45.050 --> 18:48.230
Tonight's dinner was specially made by Serara.

18:48.230 --> 18:50.580
Nyanta taught me how to cook,

18:50.580 --> 18:53.470
so I'll do the cooking on our journey.

18:55.150 --> 18:57.980
You look good in that Newlywed's Apron Dress.

18:58.360 --> 19:02.890
I tried it, too, but when you wear it, 
you really look like a newlywed.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.620
A-A-Aw...

19:05.960 --> 19:09.190
N-N-Newlywed!

19:11.420 --> 19:12.760
Safe.

19:13.950 --> 19:16.130
Let's eat!

19:17.430 --> 19:18.630
Delicious!

19:18.970 --> 19:19.980
You're right.

19:19.980 --> 19:22.950
I was feeling kind of bad that I couldn't eat

19:22.950 --> 19:25.100
Nyanta's cooking while we were on our trip.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.730
Yeah, this'll do just fine!

19:28.690 --> 19:29.720
Meow.

19:32.330 --> 19:36.110
Anyway, isn't it kind of a shame for you, Isuzu?

19:37.050 --> 19:38.110
Why?

19:38.850 --> 19:42.210
During the trip, you won't be 
able to play your concerts.

19:42.210 --> 19:46.120
Yeah, but the trip itself is like a tour, so it's fun.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.120
A tour?

19:47.540 --> 19:51.250
That's when a musician goes on a trip to perform.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.750
Yeah! I can go "dum da-da dum" on the carriage!

19:54.940 --> 19:57.060
Oh! A tour!

19:57.060 --> 19:59.040
We can do performances as we travel!

19:59.890 --> 20:00.760
Yeah!

20:01.090 --> 20:03.090
That's nice! A tour!

20:03.520 --> 20:07.300
<i>A touring trip around the galaxy!</i>

20:07.300 --> 20:10.990
<i>I'm the galactic idol!</i>

20:09.070 --> 20:10.990
You're going beyond Izu.

20:10.990 --> 20:14.260
Everyone join in with me, Tetra!

20:14.260 --> 20:16.740
A tour, huh? Amazing.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.210
Will you go around to villages, 
doing the forty-two?

20:19.210 --> 20:20.660
Forty-two?

20:20.660 --> 20:22.840
I don't think there are that 
many villages on the way.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.870
No, the forty-two is...

20:24.870 --> 20:27.310
There are about four or five villages

20:27.310 --> 20:30.160
between here and the Redstone Mountains.

20:30.370 --> 20:32.030
Awesome!

20:32.030 --> 20:34.230
Let's visit the villages and perform!

20:34.230 --> 20:37.330
We'll need to visit them for 
water and stuff, anyway!

20:37.330 --> 20:39.670
That's okay, isn't it, Shiroe?

20:40.560 --> 20:41.470
Of course.

20:41.470 --> 20:44.180
Just don't get too out of control.

20:44.180 --> 20:45.600
If anything happens, contact us—

20:45.600 --> 20:49.310
No, if you can, I think you should avoid telepathy.

20:52.620 --> 20:53.830
Why?

20:53.830 --> 20:57.710
Worry about things and solve them 
yourselves, as much as you can.

20:58.270 --> 21:01.700
Journeys like this are a good chance to learn that.

21:02.540 --> 21:05.860
Go and see a lot of different worlds, 
and enjoy a lot of different things.

21:06.270 --> 21:07.610
Okay!

21:07.610 --> 21:10.730
Allow me to be your guide and lead this tour.

21:10.730 --> 21:11.450
Yeah!

21:11.450 --> 21:13.180
A tour is also a valuable experience!

21:13.180 --> 21:14.890
Let's do our best, Isuzu!

21:17.000 --> 21:18.210
Aren't you happy?

21:20.980 --> 21:22.470
I'm happy...

21:22.470 --> 21:24.970
Of course I'm happy!

21:24.970 --> 21:27.220
I'm going to stock up on spare strings!

21:26.490 --> 21:29.240
Let go, Miss Isuzu! That hurts!

21:28.670 --> 21:30.360
I can't wait!

21:31.210 --> 21:34.260
Maybe I should get the more expensive strings!

21:40.420 --> 21:42.240
Goodbye!

21:47.920 --> 21:50.240
Remember to keep your weapons maintained.

21:50.580 --> 21:54.250
If you get lonely, remember me and blush!

21:54.860 --> 21:56.750
Take care.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.240
It's finally time.

22:12.240 --> 22:12.940
Yeah.

22:13.310 --> 22:14.830
Our journey is beginning.

22:14.830 --> 22:16.230
Our tour is beginning.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.970
Our adventure is beginning!

22:21.830 --> 22:23.620
<i>We're on our way, Shiroe!</i>

22:25.160 --> 22:27.580
<i>We're going to see a lot of different worlds!</i>

22:28.390 --> 22:29.310
Let's go!

22:29.720 --> 22:31.320
To the west!

24:05.520 --> 24:07.460
Minori and the others enjoy their journey.

24:07.810 --> 24:09.920
Fun things, hard things...

24:09.920 --> 24:12.890
Everything they encounter in 
this new world is exciting.

24:13.570 --> 24:17.720
But an uneasy mood gradually overtakes them.

24:18.060 --> 24:20.190
A mysterious person appears before them.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.900
It's a new person in glasses.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.650
Next time: The Midday Vampire.

24:23.400 --> 24:29.940
<b>The Midday Vampire</b>

24:25.650 --> 24:27.790
I have friends to run with me?
