WEBVTT

01:24.418 --> 01:25.752
Your Grace.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.549
Sergeant, I'm here on behalf
of the Red Cross...

02:12.716 --> 02:14.510
and I'd like to speak with General Kitchener.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.345
There is no General Kitchener here.

02:16.512 --> 02:17.513
Your Grace?

02:17.596 --> 02:18.972
Your Grace? Let him in.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.601
Well, if Morton's here,
then Kitchener can't be far away.

02:22.768 --> 02:26.146
My apologies, Your Grace.
Security's paramount right now.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.357
It's a secret
that you're visiting with the general.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.652
We can't be too careful with these Boers
and their guerilla tactics.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.861
Too careful?

02:33.028 --> 02:35.531
Looks like this place could use
a lot more care.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.698
Begging your pardon, sir...

02:36.823 --> 02:39.493
but these concentration camps
are the reason we're winning this war.

02:39.785 --> 02:40.786
This way.

02:44.998 --> 02:49.378
Orlando. Our knight in shining armor.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.421
Thank you for coming.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.507
What's going on, Kitchener?

02:54.174 --> 02:57.010
It seems that you've been
somewhat liberal with the truth.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.388
Time has not been kind here.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.223
Well, you'll have to explain that to Emily.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.976
On my return to England,
it will be my first port of call.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.310
She's outside...

03:05.477 --> 03:07.187
<i>with Conrad.</i>

03:07.896 --> 03:10.023
Why are we here, Mother?

03:11.233 --> 03:15.028
Do you remember why King Arthur
and his knights had a round table?

03:16.738 --> 03:19.157
Because it meant that all men were equal.

03:20.117 --> 03:23.912
It's important that people
born into privilege lead by example.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.165
That's why your father and I
are patrons of the Red Cross.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.543
Helping others...

03:29.710 --> 03:32.421
not hiding behind our status.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.886
Never forget that.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.809
I'm just going to check on your father.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.522
Stay here, Conrad.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.530
This terrible war would be over, Shola...

03:59.239 --> 04:03.410
if King Arthur and his noble knights
were still here.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.371
Of course. And which one would you be?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.707
I'd be Lancelot.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.835
Father would be Arthur. Mother, Guinevere.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.130
And you, the mighty Merlin.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.298
Really?

04:17.548 --> 04:20.719
This is ridiculous.
We're wasting precious time.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.888
Look around, people are dying.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.015
We have emergency supplies
from the Red Cross.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.725
Thank God she's on our side.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.310
Well, on my side, at least.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.604
She's more of a force
than any of our enemies.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.272
There's General Kitchener.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.859
Well, open the gates!
Bring in those supplies!

04:36.235 --> 04:37.486
Emily!

04:44.076 --> 04:45.661
Lie down until I get back.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.424
Go back to Conrad.

05:05.889 --> 05:06.974
Go to hell, Kitchener.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.357
I got him! Stop fire!

05:19.778 --> 05:22.322
Emily!

05:22.990 --> 05:25.117
Cease fire!

05:28.996 --> 05:29.997
Emily.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.875
Darling, I'm here.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.339
I'm here. Darling, I'm here.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.135
That's it. I'm here.
You have to stay with me.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.429
You have to stay with me.

05:45.596 --> 05:46.638
Darling?

05:49.141 --> 05:51.059
Protect our son.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.690
Protect him from this world. And...

05:57.733 --> 06:00.152
Never let him see war again.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.119
Promise me.

06:10.662 --> 06:11.914
I promise.

07:51.722 --> 07:52.848
You know, Conrad...

07:53.390 --> 07:56.226
up there, I feel free.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.938
Yes, I'm very much looking forward
to my first solo flight.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.274
Remember what happened to Icarus, Conrad...

08:02.441 --> 08:04.526
when he flew too close to the sun.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.821
Well, I remember him needing to escape, no?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.531
Well, he got burned.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.826
I think we both see that story differently.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.078
-Welcome home, Your Grace.
-Thank you, Shola.

08:16.288 --> 08:19.458
-Afternoon, everyone.
-Afternoon, Your Grace.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.585
Ready for your maiden flight yet, Shola?

08:21.752 --> 08:25.297
Well, if God wanted man to fly,
he would have given him wings.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.383
Yes, I suppose. You drive Father's car?

08:30.594 --> 08:31.970
You haven't any wheels.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.359
Nanny Watkins.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.696
My study in five minutes.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.368
Your Grace.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.505
Your Grace.

09:06.672 --> 09:09.508
I should be reprimanding you
for your insolence.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.553
Your opinion behind closed doors
is one thing, Polly...

09:12.719 --> 09:16.181
but I will not tolerate such demonstrations
in front of my household.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.518
I'll play by your rules
when you play by mine.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.187
Do you really think
you can keep secrets from me?

09:22.729 --> 09:23.772
What do you mean?

09:23.939 --> 09:26.859
Once again, you've turned down
Cousin Felix's invitation...

09:27.025 --> 09:28.902
for Conrad to stay with him in Russia.

09:29.695 --> 09:30.946
And how do you know that?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.532
Us nannies love a good gossip.

09:33.699 --> 09:37.494
And we've all noticed that you've no problem
with Felix traveling here...

09:37.661 --> 09:40.289
but you seem to have a problem
with Conrad traveling there.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.124
Or anywhere, for that matter.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.378
Yeah. Guilty as charged. Well, I'm sorry.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.255
I should have discussed it with you.

09:48.714 --> 09:52.050
Has all this flying around in circles
made you forget your manners?

09:52.509 --> 09:53.635
Well, what have I done now?

09:53.802 --> 09:55.387
You haven't even offered me a drink.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.347
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

09:58.098 --> 10:02.895
And if we had discussed this,
what would my opinion have been?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.647
You think that my...

10:05.814 --> 10:08.609
fear for Conrad's safety is a weakness.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.569
Fear is natural.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.030
The problem is, the more you fear something,
the more likely it is to come true.

10:16.742 --> 10:20.078
So, then, we're both in need of a nanny.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.456
So it would seem.

10:36.762 --> 10:37.763
Higher!

10:45.646 --> 10:47.523
Can you fight with only one arm?

10:47.689 --> 10:49.316
Oh, yes.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.902
If I had someone left to fight.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.452
Shola. Do you really think
a knife can beat a bullet?

11:00.911 --> 11:03.247
This is how people are fighting nowadays.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.167
Now, clean yourselves up
before this afternoon's appointment.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.812
My father also brought me here
for my first suit.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.399
Kingsman, world's finest tailor.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.157
Morning.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.242
Your Grace.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.286
Fitting room number one is ready for you.

11:42.619 --> 11:43.954
Thank you.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.250
Well, here we are.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.920
<i>I wish your mother could see you now.</i>

11:52.462 --> 11:54.590
She would've been so proud.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.426
I hope so, Father.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.473
Although, I might get more use
out of a shooting suit or a...

12:03.640 --> 12:06.018
smoking jacket, you know.

12:06.185 --> 12:09.438
Whatever might help
in the pursuit of fine birds.

12:10.189 --> 12:12.024
Oh, come on, Father.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.193
It's a big world out there.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.237
Sooner or later, you're going to have to
let me enjoy it, even if...

12:18.280 --> 12:19.823
you know, even if you don't want to.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.410
You know...

12:23.577 --> 12:24.786
Conrad...

12:27.206 --> 12:30.375
our ancestors, they were terrible people.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.671
They robbed, lied, pillaged, and killed,
until one day...

12:34.838 --> 12:37.216
they found themselves noblemen.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.676
But that nobility...

12:40.761 --> 12:42.846
it never came from chivalry.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.517
It came from being tough and ruthless.

12:47.434 --> 12:51.438
Back then, to be called a "gentleman"...

12:51.605 --> 12:53.482
would have been a death sentence.

12:54.358 --> 12:59.363
Not the mark of honor it is today.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.448
We are Oxfords...

13:02.199 --> 13:04.159
not rogues.

13:06.995 --> 13:07.996
<i>Oxford!</i>

13:08.288 --> 13:09.414
Kitchener.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.417
Well, so glad we share the same tailor.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.963
Indeed. Well, the Kingsman clientele
is enough to make any club envious.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.091
Oxford, can I borrow you for a moment?

13:19.591 --> 13:20.634
Is there somewhere private?

13:20.801 --> 13:22.594
May I suggest the pattern room upstairs, sir.

13:22.761 --> 13:23.971
Perfect.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.932
Conrad, this is Morton, my aide-de-camp.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.601
Morton, look after young Conrad for us,
will you?

13:29.768 --> 13:31.103
It will be my pleasure, my lord.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.271
Good.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.618
I gather you turned down our Austrian friend
Archduke Ferdinand's invitation to his shoot.

13:49.413 --> 13:53.417
Surely your pacifism doesn't extend
to a few birds, does it?

13:53.584 --> 13:57.254
Us bumping into each other here
was no coincidence, was it?

13:58.630 --> 14:01.258
Walls have ears in Whitehall these days.

14:01.675 --> 14:05.387
Which is why I felt Kingsman
a safer place for a chat.

14:06.305 --> 14:11.143
I'm worried that Ferdinand's political
ambitions may be putting him in danger.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.189
I need you to do me a small favor.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.107
What sort of favor?

14:17.274 --> 14:18.692
So, you're serious about being a soldier?

14:18.859 --> 14:19.860
Oh, yes.

14:19.943 --> 14:20.944
Which regiment?

14:21.028 --> 14:22.029
Grenadiers.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.113
Grenadiers. Well...

14:23.655 --> 14:27.284
when the time comes, contact me.
I'll see what I can do.

14:27.451 --> 14:28.744
Conrad.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.124
You're going to need
that shooting suit after all.

15:19.461 --> 15:20.796
My Shepherd.

15:21.672 --> 15:25.551
I have a Fabergé egg made especially for you.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.511
And look inside.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.473
A little replica of Angus...

15:31.640 --> 15:33.183
your favorite goat.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.351
You're late.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.271
Take a seat.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.942
What is trust?

15:43.986 --> 15:47.197
Trust is having confidence...

15:47.364 --> 15:49.241
in the honesty of another.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.828
That will be our weapon...

15:52.995 --> 15:55.914
to change the world.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.333
Who do I trust?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.003
Animals.

16:01.420 --> 16:04.214
They never let me down...

16:04.381 --> 16:08.427
and they follow my commands blindly.

16:08.886 --> 16:11.263
The question I now have is...

16:11.430 --> 16:15.893
can I trust you to behave like them?

16:16.059 --> 16:18.312
Open the boxes in front of you.

16:22.107 --> 16:26.820
These rings will be the symbol of membership
to my flock.

16:26.987 --> 16:31.325
Put them on,
and you will share in our successes.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.492
But...

16:33.160 --> 16:34.453
break my trust...

16:34.620 --> 16:37.247
and inside you will find...

16:37.873 --> 16:40.334
my final gift to you.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.002
A tortoise?

16:42.211 --> 16:45.422
Am I not worthy of a better animal?

16:45.589 --> 16:48.425
Rasputin, I have a bear.
I will happily exchange it with you.

16:48.592 --> 16:51.887
Yes, Princip.
I will be the great bear of Russia.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.805
Take what you believe is yours.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.891
And by all means...

16:56.058 --> 16:57.935
treat our Shepherd
with the same respect you hold...

16:58.101 --> 17:00.729
for that joke of a man
who calls himself your tsar.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.191
Go ahead, Rasputin, take it.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.443
I dare you.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.779
Now, now, Mata and Erik. We are...

17:08.945 --> 17:10.030
a team.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.199
And Rasputin here...

17:13.825 --> 17:16.912
is like my beloved Angus.

17:18.914 --> 17:21.124
Always butting...

17:22.291 --> 17:23.961
and fucking.

17:28.131 --> 17:31.552
But do not mistake fondness for weakness...

17:31.718 --> 17:35.013
you late Russian fuckstick!

17:36.014 --> 17:38.016
As everybody knows...

17:38.851 --> 17:40.477
the tortoise...

17:41.770 --> 17:44.189
eventually wins the race.

17:52.406 --> 17:53.532
Now...

17:56.118 --> 18:00.706
my spy, or should I say my mole...

18:00.873 --> 18:03.375
in the British government...

18:03.500 --> 18:07.880
informs me that
Kitchener is concerned for the safety...

18:08.046 --> 18:10.174
of the Archduke Ferdinand.

18:10.966 --> 18:14.511
Princip, my wee bear.

18:14.678 --> 18:19.141
Are you ready to prove
Kitchener's concerns are justified?

18:19.308 --> 18:22.102
Yes, I am, my Shepherd.
And I will not let you down.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.813
Damn fucking right.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.021
Does that make sense to you, Ferdinand?

19:06.980 --> 19:10.943
Now I understand why you accepted
my shooting invitation.

19:11.109 --> 19:15.113
I didn't really believe
Kitchener's scare tactics.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.824
Harping on about my being in danger.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.661
Well, only a fool
ignores a friend's warning, Ferdi.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.204
Is it really too much to ask?

19:22.371 --> 19:25.040
I think you should come back with me
and hear what he has to say.

19:25.207 --> 19:28.377
Turning you down is a hard task.

19:28.544 --> 19:30.879
I will give you my decision tonight.

19:30.963 --> 19:31.964
Good.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.237
Drive! Drive!

20:08.333 --> 20:12.171
I come here on a visit of goodwill,
to be greeted by bombs?

20:14.381 --> 20:15.382
Yes.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.843
It gives me special pleasure...

20:18.010 --> 20:19.928
I shouldn't have brought you here.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.390
We need to get home, where I can protect you.

20:23.557 --> 20:24.558
What...

20:24.933 --> 20:27.227
I just protected you.
I don't need protecting.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.229
Yes, you do, Conrad.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.065
I'm sorry, but you think you know
what the world is like...

20:32.232 --> 20:36.153
but the truth is, you're just a boy
who has no idea what men are capable of.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.156
What? Watching my mother die
wasn't a good enough introduction?

21:09.269 --> 21:10.729
Are you sure this is right?

21:10.896 --> 21:13.273
Just follow my orders.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.360
Take the first left.

21:29.665 --> 21:30.999
It's a dead end, you fool.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.709
I knew this was the wrong way.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.545
I meant the next left.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.338
Stop arguing. We're sitting ducks here.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.549
Get this car moving now.

22:18.255 --> 22:20.883
Father, it's terrible about Ferdi and Sophie.

22:22.885 --> 22:24.469
We're safe now, aren't we?

22:24.845 --> 22:26.847
Yes, but for how long?

22:27.264 --> 22:30.142
I'm beginning to understand
what Kitchener was so afraid of.

22:30.309 --> 22:33.770
Already there are rumors
the Austrians are mobilizing their army.

22:34.104 --> 22:37.357
They don't believe
this assassin acted independently.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.693
And neither do I.

22:39.860 --> 22:43.697
It's just Serbia. It's such a small part
of the world. Why do they care?

22:44.323 --> 22:48.577
Well, because small things
can grow into big problems.

22:48.952 --> 22:52.748
<i>You see, years ago,
there were three young cousins.</i>

22:52.915 --> 22:54.124
<i>The eldest was a real troublemaker...</i>

22:54.291 --> 22:55.292
Put my soldier back!

22:55.459 --> 22:56.668
There are no rules in war.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.504
I'll teach you war, Wilhelm!

22:59.254 --> 23:01.965
<i>-Their grandmother was Queen Victoria...
-</i>Nicholas. Enough!

23:02.132 --> 23:03.383
<i>...who kept them in line.</i>

23:03.550 --> 23:07.054
<i>They grew up to become
Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany...</i>

23:07.221 --> 23:11.183
<i>Tsar Nicholas of Russia,
and King George of England.</i>

23:11.350 --> 23:15.771
<i>And now, poor Ferdinand's assassination
has given the moronic kaiser...</i>

23:15.938 --> 23:19.233
<i>a reason to reignite their childhood feud.</i>

23:21.527 --> 23:24.446
But surely they've matured enough
to avoid a war?

23:24.613 --> 23:26.323
One would hope so.

23:26.657 --> 23:31.328
<i>And, thankfully, we have our own King George
to help keep the peace.</i>

23:34.414 --> 23:35.791
There it is.

23:42.714 --> 23:43.924
Look at us.

23:45.551 --> 23:49.179
Three young cousins
who thought they knew how to rule.

23:49.346 --> 23:51.473
But now the soldiers are real.

23:52.683 --> 23:54.434
Get two copies of this photograph made...

23:54.601 --> 23:56.520
and have them delivered
with these letters immediately.

23:56.687 --> 23:58.564
I'll have Morton see to it personally.

23:58.730 --> 23:59.857
Excellent.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.400
Your Majesty.

24:07.072 --> 24:08.949
-Erik.
-My kaiser.

24:09.116 --> 24:13.161
"Restraint is a virtue. Remember your duty."

24:13.829 --> 24:15.706
His Majesty, my cousin, the king of England,
strongly suggests we do nothing.

24:21.587 --> 24:24.715
Remember how Prince George
used to enjoy it...

24:24.882 --> 24:28.177
when your English mother
and her English doctors would torture you?

24:28.594 --> 24:30.596
George would tease you about your...

24:32.139 --> 24:33.473
deformities.

24:34.391 --> 24:36.226
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

24:36.393 --> 24:39.313
And don't forget
that sniggering at his side...

24:39.479 --> 24:41.315
was your little Russian cousin...

24:42.274 --> 24:43.650
<i>Tsar Nicholas.</i>

24:43.817 --> 24:46.236
Cousin George is imploring self-restraint
against our other cousin, the moronic kaiser.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.618
King George has always
protected our interests.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.370
Why would we go to war
over something so trivial?

24:55.537 --> 24:57.497
Because we gave Serbia our word.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.666
And besides, I hate the kaiser.

24:59.958 --> 25:03.962
It will be good for his oversized ego
to match his undersized hand.

25:06.173 --> 25:08.675
A wise decision, my tsar.

25:09.134 --> 25:12.679
The soul of Russia is safe in your hands.

25:14.723 --> 25:15.891
<i>The world will laugh at you...</i>

25:16.058 --> 25:19.728
for not keeping your word
and standing by the Austrians.

25:20.354 --> 25:22.606
Ignore the English king.

25:23.941 --> 25:25.859
Tell George to mind his own business, <i>ja?</i>

25:28.779 --> 25:33.700
If I want a war, then I will have it.

25:36.078 --> 25:39.414
As Russia's ally, we have no choice
but to join this war.

25:39.581 --> 25:42.042
I don't understand. The kaiser and the tsar
have both ignored the king's wishes. Why?

25:44.503 --> 25:45.504
That's a good question.

25:45.671 --> 25:47.756
With all due respect, sir...

25:47.923 --> 25:49.800
this debate should happen
after we have won the war.

25:49.967 --> 25:51.134
The prime minister is waiting.

25:51.677 --> 25:52.678
And we're late.

25:53.053 --> 25:54.054
Morton's right.

25:54.137 --> 25:57.307
My lord, it would be my honor to volunteer.

25:58.433 --> 26:01.061
-Honor?
-Fine words, young Conrad.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.980
But therein lies the problem.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.983
Legally, you're not old enough to join up.

26:06.984 --> 26:11.363
But still young enough to believe it's an
honorable thing to die for one's country.

26:12.072 --> 26:15.909
The object of war
is not to die for one's country...

26:16.076 --> 26:19.246
but to make the enemy die for theirs.

26:26.712 --> 26:30.007
Fix bayonets!

26:58.076 --> 27:04.333
<i>Not even I could have imagined
a war like this.</i>

27:06.293 --> 27:09.671
<i>What I thought would take a decade
for us to achieve...</i>

27:10.923 --> 27:14.968
<i>has taken two short years.</i>

27:19.556 --> 27:23.185
<i>We have drained Europe's resources...</i>

27:23.685 --> 27:27.814
<i>and millions have died pointlessly.</i>

27:27.981 --> 27:29.441
Fire!

27:29.608 --> 27:35.614
We have broken the trust
between the people and the inbred monarchs...

27:35.781 --> 27:39.535
who only rule due to their fortunate birth.

27:41.328 --> 27:45.749
Do you know who hates King George
more than the kaiser?

27:47.501 --> 27:48.627
Me.

27:49.294 --> 27:51.672
The English monarchy...

27:51.839 --> 27:56.552
has oppressed my beloved Scotland
for over 700 years...

27:56.718 --> 28:00.055
and it is time for retribution.

28:00.764 --> 28:04.017
We will pull Russia out of our war...

28:04.434 --> 28:10.315
and unleash the full might of Germany
to destroy England.

28:10.774 --> 28:12.526
Rasputin...

28:12.943 --> 28:17.739
are you ready to begin
the demise of King George?

28:17.906 --> 28:20.576
Thy will be done, my Shepherd.

28:27.291 --> 28:30.752
-They've started conscription.
-Yes, I'm well aware of that, Conrad.

28:31.545 --> 28:32.546
And?

28:32.713 --> 28:35.299
Well, it was bad enough
I didn't join when it was voluntary...

28:35.465 --> 28:37.926
Conrad, this is not a war. Do you understand?

28:38.093 --> 28:39.761
It's not like any war that we've ever seen.

28:39.928 --> 28:41.763
I don't care! I should be fighting.

28:41.889 --> 28:44.433
It's not fighting. It's dying.

28:46.393 --> 28:48.520
Much like this conversation.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.232
Tell that to Kitchener.

29:07.581 --> 29:09.625
You're still too young, Conrad.

29:12.419 --> 29:15.047
But everyone's lying about their age.
They're all going over.

29:15.214 --> 29:16.215
I know.

29:16.924 --> 29:18.300
And I know you want to fight.

29:19.635 --> 29:21.345
It's a testament to your character...

29:21.929 --> 29:23.055
and I'm proud of you for it.

29:23.222 --> 29:24.973
Yes, but look what I was given.

29:26.183 --> 29:27.184
In the village.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.229
It's the symbol of a coward.

29:30.646 --> 29:32.981
And I should suffer such humiliation?

29:34.233 --> 29:37.694
Reputation is what people think of you.

29:37.861 --> 29:40.447
Character is what you are.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.121
Victoria Cross.

29:49.039 --> 29:50.415
Is it yours?

29:51.250 --> 29:52.251
Yes.

29:53.126 --> 29:57.214
When I was young,
like you, I wanted to serve my country.

29:59.675 --> 30:02.970
<i>But soon I began to question
what right we had...</i>

30:03.136 --> 30:06.348
to take the land, riches...

30:06.682 --> 30:11.478
and the lives of people
who were only defending their homeland.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.608
<i>Every man I killed...</i>

30:18.110 --> 30:20.571
<i>I killed a piece of myself.</i>

30:26.994 --> 30:30.414
Maybe having a feather
would have been better.

30:31.999 --> 30:36.044
So, the next day, I put down my rifle
and I picked up a stretcher.

30:37.171 --> 30:40.632
I should've been given the Cross
for saving lives, not taking them.

30:42.968 --> 30:45.470
As soon as I replace this
with my own medal...

30:46.805 --> 30:48.390
I'll join the medical corps.

30:51.643 --> 30:55.022
I have informed Kitchener
of your intention of joining up.

30:55.480 --> 30:59.610
And he has assured me
that he will not let you slip through.

31:40.859 --> 31:42.319
I have a vision.

31:43.779 --> 31:47.199
This boy is the symbol of the soul of Russia.

31:49.868 --> 31:51.954
You must save Russia.

31:53.705 --> 31:58.168
You must pull out of the war
to save your son's life.

31:58.335 --> 31:59.962
This is nonsense.

32:00.712 --> 32:05.342
You dare to question the vessel of the Lord?

32:07.678 --> 32:12.432
You dare to risk your son's life?

32:13.517 --> 32:16.728
Nicholas, come to your senses now!

32:17.145 --> 32:18.647
Please.

32:19.731 --> 32:20.858
Please.

32:28.574 --> 32:30.367
<i>My dear cousin Conrad.</i>

32:30.868 --> 32:33.036
<i>It has been too long
since we last saw each other...</i>

32:33.203 --> 32:35.789
<i>and I'm sorry
I'm only writing to you now, but...</i>

32:36.748 --> 32:39.793
<i>in these difficult times,
I'm not sure whom I can trust.</i>

32:46.842 --> 32:48.427
Welcome back.

32:50.387 --> 32:52.764
<i>For a while now,
I've harbored my suspicions...</i>

32:52.931 --> 32:55.726
<i>of this so-called priest, Rasputin.</i>

32:56.310 --> 32:58.520
<i>He has the tsar under his spell...</i>

32:58.687 --> 33:01.523
<i>both spiritually and through opium...</i>

33:03.192 --> 33:06.528
<i>and has persuaded him
to withdraw from the war.</i>

33:08.155 --> 33:12.326
<i>The tsar intends to announce this
in his New Year's speech.</i>

33:12.784 --> 33:15.037
Cousin Felix sends his regards.

33:16.496 --> 33:19.458
<i>I hope your father's influence can help.</i>

33:20.501 --> 33:23.128
Morton, any ideas?

33:23.754 --> 33:27.716
Well, sir, in my opinion,
this is a very grave situation.

33:27.883 --> 33:29.510
We can trust absolutely no one.

33:29.676 --> 33:31.970
I suggest we assemble
an elite squad of men...

33:32.137 --> 33:34.723
we go to Russia,
and we sort it out ourselves.

33:34.890 --> 33:36.767
Agreed. See to it immediately.

33:36.934 --> 33:41.104
As I'm not allowed to join up,
may I at least go with you?

33:42.856 --> 33:45.442
Conrad, you know your father
made me swear that I would...

33:45.609 --> 33:48.570
Protect my son at all costs.

33:50.447 --> 33:52.616
Where do you want to go, Conrad?

33:54.535 --> 33:55.953
-Russia.
-Why?

33:56.119 --> 33:58.830
To help Cousin Yusupov deal with Rasputin.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.958
He's going to force Russia out of the war.

34:01.917 --> 34:03.585
Kitchener, have you killed so many men...

34:03.710 --> 34:06.088
that you're now relying on boys
to run your military intelligence?

34:06.255 --> 34:08.549
-How dare you speak to...
-Shut up, Morton.

34:11.051 --> 34:12.427
Conrad, we're leaving.

34:14.304 --> 34:15.304
Now!

34:26.065 --> 34:27.067
Your lordship?

34:27.525 --> 34:30.821
Let's just hope we don't make
such a mess of things in Russia.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.000
One more dispatch box for tonight, sir.

34:44.626 --> 34:47.254
Damn it, Morton.
How much do you expect a man to read?

34:47.420 --> 34:51.216
I'm terribly sorry, my lord.
I would help, but I'm definitely...

34:51.382 --> 34:53.844
definitely more of a soldier
than I am a sailor.

34:54.011 --> 34:56.096
Well, go outside, man, and get some air.

34:57.014 --> 34:58.182
Quite right.

36:02.996 --> 36:04.831
Five million dead.

36:06.542 --> 36:07.960
May God forgive me.

36:30.399 --> 36:34.695
First Ferdinand, and now Kitchener.
This was not an accident.

36:35.237 --> 36:36.321
Kitchener was your friend.

36:36.738 --> 36:40.576
Not to mention this country's last hope.
How can you be so calm?

36:40.742 --> 36:42.286
<i>My dear Oxford.</i>

36:42.452 --> 36:45.330
<i>I wanted to apologize for our recent fracas.</i>

36:45.706 --> 36:48.750
<i>In my opinion, Conrad is a fine young man.</i>

36:48.917 --> 36:50.961
He was betrayed. We must do something.

36:51.336 --> 36:53.005
<i>Always ready to face the world.</i>

36:53.172 --> 36:55.507
No, don't ignore me, Father.
You know it's true.

36:55.883 --> 36:57.718
You cannot keep running away from problems.

36:57.885 --> 37:01.346
<i>But I shall, of course,
respect your wishes...</i>

37:01.513 --> 37:04.892
<i>and do everything I can
to keep him out of harm's way.</i>

37:05.058 --> 37:08.187
I don't believe it was a German mine.
There is something more afoot.

37:10.981 --> 37:12.649
And what if you're successful?

37:13.192 --> 37:15.944
What if you're successful
and keep me locked away as the world burns?

37:16.111 --> 37:20.032
<i>If all parents shared your outlook,
there would be no wars.</i>

37:20.574 --> 37:25.871
<i>But until that day comes,
I will no doubt be kept busy.</i>

37:26.580 --> 37:29.333
<i>I remain your friend, Kitch.</i>

37:33.504 --> 37:35.672
Your incessant need to protect me...

37:35.839 --> 37:38.383
will not redeem your own failure
to protect Mother.

37:44.348 --> 37:46.266
I'm sorry, Father.

37:58.779 --> 37:59.780
No, no.

38:02.824 --> 38:04.117
I'm sorry.

38:08.997 --> 38:10.123
Follow me.

38:44.825 --> 38:47.035
Well, about time.

38:47.578 --> 38:49.121
Welcome to the club.

38:49.872 --> 38:51.498
Is he part of the briefing?

38:51.915 --> 38:53.083
Yes.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.295
Take a look.

39:02.134 --> 39:04.803
You see, this war has made me realize...

39:04.970 --> 39:09.266
that we cannot rely on politicians
to do their job properly.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.810
So, I decided...

39:12.436 --> 39:14.438
that we should do something about it.

39:14.605 --> 39:16.565
This isn't making any sense to me, Father.

39:16.732 --> 39:17.900
Let me explain.

39:18.317 --> 39:22.279
My reputation is of a man
not wanting to be involved...

39:22.446 --> 39:28.243
which means that my character finds it
much easier to be involved unnoticed.

39:28.660 --> 39:33.790
Just like domestic servants everywhere
who are seen but not heard.

39:33.957 --> 39:36.126
Essentially invisible.

39:36.710 --> 39:39.588
Unless they're part of the Oxford family,
of course.

39:40.088 --> 39:42.966
Shola and Polly have gathered...

39:43.133 --> 39:47.596
a network of domestics
such as the world has never seen.

39:47.930 --> 39:51.892
While British intelligence
listens at keyholes...

39:53.352 --> 39:56.063
our people are actually in the room.

39:56.355 --> 39:57.356
Very clever.

39:57.856 --> 40:00.317
Now, after Ferdinand's assassination...

40:00.484 --> 40:03.779
I visited Gavrilo Princip
in his prison in Sarajevo.

40:22.172 --> 40:23.549
Thank you.

40:27.928 --> 40:29.304
Why did you kill my friend?

40:29.680 --> 40:32.558
It was the alcohol. I was overcome.

40:35.394 --> 40:37.020
I'm just a simple Serb.

40:37.187 --> 40:41.817
A very expensive ring
for such a simple Serb.

40:42.693 --> 40:44.319
And a secret compartment.

40:44.486 --> 40:47.823
That smelled of almonds. Therefore, cyanide.

40:48.156 --> 40:51.159
Princip's ring proves
he was not acting alone.

40:51.326 --> 40:54.288
There is, as you say, Conrad, more afoot.

40:54.454 --> 40:55.455
Indeed.

40:57.124 --> 41:00.002
Your cousin's letter made us
extend our network to Russia...

41:00.169 --> 41:01.461
and it paid off.

41:02.462 --> 41:05.299
The tsar's nanny found a ring
in Rasputin's chambers.

41:06.842 --> 41:10.846
Identical to Princip's,
but with a tortoise instead of a bear.

41:11.013 --> 41:12.973
Then I think we must
go to Russia immediately...

41:13.140 --> 41:15.809
and find a way to interrogate this monk.

41:15.976 --> 41:18.520
But by all accounts, Rasputin is unbreakable.

41:19.438 --> 41:22.858
As long as he's alive,
the tsar will never change his mind...

41:23.025 --> 41:25.027
and with Russia out of the war...

41:25.569 --> 41:27.279
England is doomed.

41:27.821 --> 41:28.864
My lord.

41:34.036 --> 41:37.164
One life to save millions.

41:42.878 --> 41:43.962
So...

41:44.713 --> 41:47.925
the only way to honor the vow
I made to your mother...

41:49.635 --> 41:52.763
is to break the vow I made to myself.

41:54.348 --> 41:56.642
I'm afraid we have no other choice.

41:58.268 --> 42:02.856
It is time for us to kill Grigori Rasputin.

42:08.320 --> 42:13.158
Rasputin has accepted an invitation
to your cousin's Christmas ball.

42:13.659 --> 42:18.956
The tsar's nanny informs me
of Rasputin's weakness for sweet cakes.

42:19.373 --> 42:22.334
And even sweeter boys.

42:23.377 --> 42:26.463
So, after the main course is served...

42:27.047 --> 42:30.634
Conrad will entice Rasputin...

42:31.134 --> 42:33.637
to a private dessert in the summer room...

42:34.012 --> 42:37.432
where nanny's legendary Bakewell tart...

42:37.599 --> 42:39.059
laced with poison...

42:39.810 --> 42:41.019
will be waiting for him.

42:41.186 --> 42:43.272
Polly, get baking.

42:44.273 --> 42:46.441
Yes. And don't forget the poison.

42:52.322 --> 42:54.408
Get him to eat the cake. Understand?

42:54.575 --> 42:55.576
Yes, Father.

42:55.701 --> 42:58.287
Good. Tonight we will be rogues...

42:58.912 --> 43:00.330
not Oxfords.

43:06.170 --> 43:09.965
Our guest of honor, Father Rasputin.

43:55.302 --> 43:57.304
Are you waiters or Englishmen?

43:58.597 --> 44:01.600
Whatever you are, get me a fucking drink.

44:01.892 --> 44:04.353
Are you a monk or a ballet dancer?

44:10.442 --> 44:13.278
I see you've mastered the Beryozka glide.

44:13.904 --> 44:17.449
Why don't you glide over there
and get me a fucking drink?

44:24.248 --> 44:26.208
Englishmen.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.168
I like the English.

44:29.962 --> 44:33.090
But it's a long way to come
for a Christmas party.

44:33.423 --> 44:36.218
Well, for me, yes. But not for my son...

44:36.593 --> 44:40.722
who is certainly a lot more fun than I am
in these dark days.

44:45.060 --> 44:48.939
I'm looking for someone who can help me
gain an audience with the tsar.

44:49.398 --> 44:51.024
Perhaps you can be of assistance.

44:51.525 --> 44:53.610
But I am just a humble monk.

44:53.777 --> 44:57.030
A humble monk that this whole room reveres...

44:57.823 --> 44:59.366
or fears.

45:05.414 --> 45:10.669
I only make decisions when my stomach is full
or my balls are empty.

45:10.961 --> 45:14.089
Well, thank God dinner is being served.

45:15.215 --> 45:16.466
So...

45:16.925 --> 45:20.679
your father tells me you like to have fun.

45:20.846 --> 45:24.558
Yes. I believe I'm sufficiently open-minded.

45:25.309 --> 45:28.645
What is it that you Russians do
that an Englishman can enjoy?

45:28.812 --> 45:30.814
Well, everything.

45:30.981 --> 45:34.151
Food, music, ballet...

45:34.318 --> 45:36.862
tobacco, art.

45:37.029 --> 45:38.572
But most of all...

45:42.451 --> 45:46.246
we like to fuck like tigers.

45:55.797 --> 45:59.968
Is that something an English boy might enjoy?

46:02.596 --> 46:03.597
Yes.

46:05.098 --> 46:07.559
But tonight I do not want to teach.

46:11.104 --> 46:13.023
Change seats with your father.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.945
I'm so sorry if I have offended you.

46:18.362 --> 46:21.031
Only if you consider being boring offensive.

46:21.198 --> 46:22.950
Now do as you're told.

46:24.451 --> 46:25.452
Yes.

46:30.666 --> 46:33.460
Sorry, Father. He wants us to swap places.

46:39.883 --> 46:42.594
Excuse me, forgive me. Forgive me.

46:49.977 --> 46:53.146
This leg is a fearful curse.

46:54.815 --> 46:59.361
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say your son was trying to fuck me.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.906
More likely you were trying to fuck him.

47:03.407 --> 47:05.033
Your reputation precedes you.

47:05.200 --> 47:08.453
Well, if you know so much
about my reputation...

47:09.454 --> 47:11.290
put your leg in my lap.

47:11.748 --> 47:13.500
I may be able to fix it.

47:14.334 --> 47:16.044
-Here?
-Not here.

47:16.211 --> 47:18.922
Somewhere private, of course.

47:26.305 --> 47:27.890
Here we are.

47:32.394 --> 47:33.896
You are expecting someone?

47:34.479 --> 47:36.064
Yes, our nanny is a wonderful cook...

47:36.231 --> 47:40.194
so she's made this cake
as a gift for our host, the prince.

47:42.237 --> 47:43.238
Please...

47:44.489 --> 47:46.366
take your trousers off and sit down.

47:47.910 --> 47:49.203
Certainly.

47:49.578 --> 47:52.164
I will make the room warm for you.

47:57.377 --> 48:00.714
In summer, I come here
with my young friends.

48:01.423 --> 48:04.009
Swim naked in the bathing pond...

48:04.968 --> 48:10.015
then come inside
and fuck in front of the fire.

48:10.474 --> 48:11.767
Naturally.

48:13.143 --> 48:14.144
There we are.

48:14.520 --> 48:15.687
Trousers off.

48:26.073 --> 48:27.074
Steady.

48:27.866 --> 48:29.451
Blood is life.

48:30.244 --> 48:34.039
Its flow is healing.

48:35.832 --> 48:38.836
And I can teach it where to flow.

48:48.011 --> 48:52.808
Your wound was fixed superficially
and with very poor needle work.

48:57.020 --> 48:58.981
This cake is good, no?

48:59.439 --> 49:03.652
Yes. It's Bakewell tart. It's my favorite.

49:03.819 --> 49:07.114
We can eat it together
when I put my trousers back on.

49:08.073 --> 49:11.326
No. Well, to do this properly...

49:13.453 --> 49:14.580
I will need energy.

49:33.932 --> 49:34.933
It's very good.

49:38.478 --> 49:39.646
Very English.

49:39.813 --> 49:41.356
Yes. It's very English.

50:09.009 --> 50:11.720
-What's that noise? We should go in.
-No, no.

50:11.887 --> 50:15.098
It's Rasputin, not your father.
I think it's the poison killing him.

50:30.864 --> 50:33.909
Relax. Let the blood flow.

50:34.284 --> 50:35.827
-Let me lick your wounds.
-Yes.

50:35.994 --> 50:37.704
-Trust me. Trust me.
-Oh, God.

50:37.871 --> 50:39.414
-Oh, my, I can see it.
-Trust me.

50:39.581 --> 50:42.835
Don't worry, I will help you,
and you will help me.

50:45.754 --> 50:47.673
Why do you want to see the tsar?

50:49.132 --> 50:52.511
The tsar needs to stay in the war.

50:52.678 --> 50:54.596
What makes you think he won't?

50:55.722 --> 50:58.934
I'm told he's being influenced.

50:59.101 --> 51:00.644
Good. Now we are getting somewhere.

51:00.811 --> 51:04.731
So, if you really want your leg fixed,
tell me the truth.

51:04.898 --> 51:06.024
Why are you here?

51:06.191 --> 51:07.192
I'm here...

51:07.359 --> 51:08.735
-Because?
-Because...

51:08.902 --> 51:10.237
-Because?
-Because...

51:10.404 --> 51:12.656
-Because?
-Because I'm going to kill...

51:26.587 --> 51:27.921
I apologize.

51:32.551 --> 51:33.635
Your cake...

51:39.224 --> 51:41.018
did not agree with me.

51:48.192 --> 51:49.359
Come!

51:50.986 --> 51:53.197
We must ice your leg.

51:53.906 --> 51:58.994
Only two minutes in the cold water,
and you will be like a new man.

52:02.873 --> 52:04.541
-My leg...
-Yes.

52:04.708 --> 52:06.335
-...is healed.
-Yes.

52:06.418 --> 52:07.419
Yes.

52:07.503 --> 52:09.171
Walk to me.

52:10.214 --> 52:12.841
No. No, no, no. Not the cane.

52:12.925 --> 52:13.926
Leave the cane.

52:14.092 --> 52:15.886
-Oh, yes.
-Leave the cane.

52:16.512 --> 52:18.430
I didn't believe you.

52:19.640 --> 52:22.643
Come to me. Come to me.

52:22.976 --> 52:25.938
-Why is Father laughing?
-I have no idea.

52:26.438 --> 52:29.399
Now let the cold...

52:29.566 --> 52:31.652
Russian water...

52:32.027 --> 52:34.363
heal you forever.

52:37.449 --> 52:42.913
Come. Come. Come. Come.

52:43.080 --> 52:45.082
Come. Come.

52:45.249 --> 52:47.751
-Yes. Yes, yes.
-It's freezing.

52:47.918 --> 52:50.128
Let Mother Nature work her magic.

52:52.881 --> 52:54.299
Two minutes.

52:54.466 --> 52:56.635
Two minutes, and you will be healed.

52:57.177 --> 52:59.012
You will be healed.

52:59.346 --> 53:01.306
Bakewell tart.

53:02.349 --> 53:06.061
Tell me, a lot of almonds in Bakewell tart.

53:07.145 --> 53:09.940
What other ingredients in Bakewell tart?

53:10.107 --> 53:12.401
I have no idea. I'm not a cook.

53:12.568 --> 53:13.777
Well, I am.

53:13.944 --> 53:18.031
And I also know
what else smells like almonds.

53:18.657 --> 53:20.033
Cyanide!

53:21.243 --> 53:23.453
If you really knew my reputation...

53:23.620 --> 53:26.373
you'd know I take a little poison
for breakfast...

53:26.540 --> 53:29.042
-He's in trouble.
-...to keep myself immune.

53:37.885 --> 53:39.595
Now, that's more like it.

53:41.430 --> 53:46.643
Time to dance... on your graves.

53:50.189 --> 53:52.065
Go and help your father.

53:59.656 --> 54:02.409
Father. Father. Oh, God. You're freezing.

54:02.784 --> 54:05.204
Father, are you all right? Breathe.

54:05.370 --> 54:07.748
I'm so cold. I'm so cold.

54:52.292 --> 54:53.377
Shola.

55:27.119 --> 55:28.620
Shola.

55:36.295 --> 55:37.296
Do it.

55:37.588 --> 55:38.589
Do it!

55:38.714 --> 55:39.715
Do it!

55:45.929 --> 55:47.222
Shoot me.

55:50.392 --> 55:52.477
Please kill me.

55:56.106 --> 55:57.900
Beautiful boy.

56:26.512 --> 56:28.263
I fixed your leg.

56:28.430 --> 56:32.226
Which is more than I can say
for your son's neck.

57:20.899 --> 57:23.527
Thank you for my new leg.

57:42.004 --> 57:43.005
Are you all right?

57:43.130 --> 57:45.340
I'm fine. Thank you.

57:45.507 --> 57:50.220
No. Thank you. You saved my life.

57:52.931 --> 57:54.558
And you, mine.

57:55.767 --> 57:56.768
What about Shola?

57:58.270 --> 58:01.481
He'll be all right.
He just needs to sleep it off.

58:18.207 --> 58:21.210
Why is it that boys are always so messy?

58:22.252 --> 58:24.713
Pick him up. It's time to go.

58:32.346 --> 58:35.724
You have got to be fucking kidding me!

58:40.103 --> 58:44.566
I want you to pick up where Rasputin failed.

58:44.733 --> 58:48.946
I don't care about your ideology
or your politics.

58:49.112 --> 58:51.532
Just start your fucking revolution...

58:51.698 --> 58:54.952
and get Russia out of my war...

58:55.118 --> 58:56.245
Comrade Lenin.

58:56.411 --> 58:57.704
Yes, my Shepherd.

58:57.871 --> 58:59.873
When my revolution is complete...

59:00.040 --> 59:03.627
the flocks left will be so powerful...

59:03.794 --> 59:08.048
your one problem will be finding my equal
to balance from the right.

59:15.973 --> 59:17.474
What's wrong with him?

59:18.308 --> 59:21.436
Today your father broke his vow of pacifism.

59:22.521 --> 59:23.897
But it was the right thing to do.

59:24.064 --> 59:27.442
Right or wrong,
it doesn't make it any easier.

59:28.986 --> 59:33.448
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

59:33.615 --> 59:38.161
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

59:38.328 --> 59:43.083
<i>Happy birthday, dearest Conrad</i>

59:44.209 --> 59:49.840
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

59:53.010 --> 59:54.011
Good boy.

1:00:00.184 --> 1:00:01.393
To my son.

1:00:04.396 --> 1:00:05.856
Thank you.

1:00:06.398 --> 1:00:09.776
Today, you proved yourself a man...

1:00:09.943 --> 1:00:13.530
and you've made us all very proud.

1:00:14.448 --> 1:00:17.743
A toast to our successful mission...

1:00:17.910 --> 1:00:19.953
and my new leg.

1:00:24.625 --> 1:00:26.001
Happy birthday, Conrad.

1:00:26.335 --> 1:00:27.836
Happy birthday.

1:00:30.047 --> 1:00:31.048
Thank you, Father.

1:00:46.104 --> 1:00:48.065
I'm glad that we can finally see eye to eye.

1:00:49.816 --> 1:00:51.109
Well, we can now.

1:00:54.530 --> 1:00:57.491
Now that I've blown out 19 candles,
I'm sure you'll...

1:00:57.658 --> 1:01:00.160
give me your blessing as I join up and...

1:01:00.327 --> 1:01:02.287
finally fulfill my duty to my country.

1:01:03.830 --> 1:01:08.043
Conrad, you've just exceeded your duty
to your country.

1:01:09.169 --> 1:01:11.964
My wishes have nothing to do with your age.

1:01:12.130 --> 1:01:15.425
Father, your wishes were only granted
because of my age.

1:01:16.385 --> 1:01:18.846
There's nothing you can do to stop me now.

1:01:19.763 --> 1:01:22.724
All I ask for is your blessing, at least.

1:01:25.727 --> 1:01:27.396
I'm sorry, Conrad.

1:01:27.980 --> 1:01:33.193
But you're asking for the one thing
that I cannot and I will not give you.

1:02:25.245 --> 1:02:26.246
My kaiser.

1:02:26.371 --> 1:02:30.834
Our naval blockade around England
has sunk another American passenger ship.

1:02:31.168 --> 1:02:33.795
The American president
could soon run out of patience...

1:02:33.962 --> 1:02:36.465
and if they join the war on England's side...

1:02:37.132 --> 1:02:38.467
we will be defeated.

1:02:38.842 --> 1:02:40.969
There are no rules in war.

1:02:41.136 --> 1:02:44.848
And making England starve to death
is worth the risk.

1:02:46.517 --> 1:02:48.602
But if you send this...

1:02:48.769 --> 1:02:51.146
it will mitigate the risk.

1:02:56.902 --> 1:02:58.153
Are you sure?

1:02:58.320 --> 1:02:59.988
Yes, my kaiser.

1:03:04.076 --> 1:03:05.160
Get me Zimmermann.

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:09.373
Zimmermann, telegraph the following.

1:03:16.046 --> 1:03:20.926
Send this immediately.
Use the kaiser's top-level encoding.

1:03:24.763 --> 1:03:25.764
Gentlemen...

1:03:25.931 --> 1:03:28.225
we have a priority-one intercept.

1:03:28.392 --> 1:03:30.936
Whatever you're doing, cease now.

1:03:31.103 --> 1:03:33.105
We need this code cracked pronto.

1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:37.401
Tea?

1:03:37.484 --> 1:03:38.485
Please.

1:03:47.077 --> 1:03:48.287
Good job, Rita.

1:03:48.453 --> 1:03:50.706
This code is what the kaiser has been using.

1:03:50.873 --> 1:03:53.083
It must be unbelievably important.

1:03:53.250 --> 1:03:54.459
Can you break it?

1:03:55.085 --> 1:03:58.922
One! Two! Three! Four!

1:03:59.089 --> 1:04:01.633
<i>I'll need a lot more information.</i>

1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:03.552
Keep your eye on the enemy!

1:04:03.719 --> 1:04:04.845
Aim rifles to the left!

1:04:04.928 --> 1:04:05.929
Fire!

1:04:06.597 --> 1:04:07.931
Thank you.

1:04:08.432 --> 1:04:10.350
What makes the grass grow?

1:04:10.517 --> 1:04:12.352
Blood! Blood! Blood!

1:04:13.228 --> 1:04:14.229
<i>What're you gonna do?</i>

1:04:14.396 --> 1:04:15.981
Kill! Kill! Kill!

1:04:18.942 --> 1:04:20.027
Here's your tea.

1:04:21.862 --> 1:04:23.488
Quick! March!

1:04:28.368 --> 1:04:30.662
I am using the cipher.

1:04:30.829 --> 1:04:33.498
Is the eight a "Z" or is it an "R"?

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:38.962
<i>Godspeed to you all.</i>

1:04:39.129 --> 1:04:40.881
And remember...

1:04:41.048 --> 1:04:44.801
<i>"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."</i>

1:04:44.968 --> 1:04:46.094
What does that mean?

1:04:46.261 --> 1:04:49.056
"It's sweet and proper
to die for one's country."

1:04:51.850 --> 1:04:53.977
Direct from Germany.

1:04:54.394 --> 1:04:55.395
Thank you.

1:05:02.361 --> 1:05:04.321
<i>I am using the cipher.</i>

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:07.783
<i>Is the eight a "Z" or is it an "R"?</i>

1:05:09.826 --> 1:05:12.454
<i>A "Z." Thank you.</i>

1:05:23.048 --> 1:05:24.550
I've cracked the code.

1:05:25.092 --> 1:05:27.469
It's from Arthur Zimmermann,
the German Secretary of State in Berlin...

1:05:27.636 --> 1:05:29.596
to their ambassador in Mexico City.

1:05:29.888 --> 1:05:32.182
He proposes an alliance with Mexico.

1:05:32.349 --> 1:05:34.893
Germany wants to divert America's attention,
so they're asking Mexico to invade America.

1:05:37.771 --> 1:05:38.897
In print, there.

1:05:39.064 --> 1:05:42.317
So, when President Wilson sees this,
then he has no choice, but...

1:05:43.068 --> 1:05:44.278
He has to enter the war.

1:05:44.444 --> 1:05:46.238
And the war will be over.

1:05:46.864 --> 1:05:49.575
Well done. Oh, my dear Polly.

1:05:49.741 --> 1:05:51.285
Well done, you.

1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:54.621
You are incredible.

1:05:55.539 --> 1:05:57.541
And there's hope for Conrad.

1:06:02.171 --> 1:06:03.755
<i>Well done, Oxford.</i>

1:06:03.922 --> 1:06:08.177
My idiot cousin, the kaiser,
has finally shot himself in the foot.

1:06:08.343 --> 1:06:11.847
You've hit a six with this telegram, old boy.
Kitchener would be proud.

1:06:13.432 --> 1:06:15.434
Well, I think champagne is in order.

1:06:15.893 --> 1:06:18.478
Thank you, Your Majesty,
but I vowed not to drink...

1:06:18.645 --> 1:06:22.733
until Conrad has returned
safely from the war.

1:06:22.900 --> 1:06:24.526
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

1:06:25.068 --> 1:06:29.156
I'll make sure the only action your boy sees
is sharpening the general's pencils.

1:06:29.990 --> 1:06:32.618
I'm not sure that's cricket.

1:06:36.246 --> 1:06:39.416
Orlando, you know how many boys' lives
you've saved with this telegram?

1:06:40.125 --> 1:06:41.835
At least let me save one.

1:06:45.756 --> 1:06:46.757
So...

1:06:47.674 --> 1:06:49.885
now that Conrad's safety is assured...

1:06:52.471 --> 1:06:53.972
to peace in our time.

1:06:54.723 --> 1:06:56.850
To peace in our time.

1:06:58.352 --> 1:07:01.188
King George is waiting for your response,
Mr. President.

1:07:01.355 --> 1:07:03.815
But how can this telegram be real?

1:07:03.982 --> 1:07:05.943
Not even the Germans would be this stupid.

1:07:06.109 --> 1:07:08.695
-But, sir...
-I'm not doing a damn thing...

1:07:08.862 --> 1:07:10.864
till I have undeniable proof.

1:07:11.490 --> 1:07:12.491
Douglas.

1:07:13.116 --> 1:07:15.035
Statesman on the rocks, please.

1:07:22.876 --> 1:07:25.337
Lieutenant Oxford reporting for duty, sir.

1:07:26.505 --> 1:07:28.549
Ah, yes. Oxford.

1:07:29.299 --> 1:07:32.594
Lucky man.
You've been assigned back to London.

1:07:35.347 --> 1:07:37.224
Sir, there must be some mistake.

1:07:37.391 --> 1:07:39.518
No. Fortune favors the brave...

1:07:40.477 --> 1:07:42.646
or those under the king's gaze.

1:07:46.775 --> 1:07:47.943
Sir.

1:07:50.195 --> 1:07:51.238
Attention!

1:08:12.217 --> 1:08:13.302
Lance corporal.

1:08:13.802 --> 1:08:14.803
Sir.

1:08:14.928 --> 1:08:15.929
What's your name?

1:08:16.013 --> 1:08:17.555
Lance Corporal Reid, sir.

1:08:18.390 --> 1:08:19.390
Follow me.

1:08:35.323 --> 1:08:37.242
Shola, I presume.

1:08:38.785 --> 1:08:39.786
Yes.

1:08:39.870 --> 1:08:42.163
Conrad has sent me to see the duke.

1:08:44.750 --> 1:08:45.751
And your name, sir?

1:08:46.376 --> 1:08:50.839
Good question. It's a complicated answer.

1:08:51.006 --> 1:08:52.799
I can only tell the duke in person.

1:08:53.175 --> 1:08:54.635
Well, I still need a name.

1:08:54.801 --> 1:08:56.511
This is gonna sound stupid.

1:08:57.220 --> 1:08:59.348
But according to Conrad, I'm Lancelot.

1:09:00.015 --> 1:09:04.310
You're Merlin, and I'm requesting an audience
with King Arthur.

1:09:05.687 --> 1:09:07.272
Follow me, sir.

1:09:10.067 --> 1:09:13.319
"Doubts persist as to telegram authenticity.

1:09:13.487 --> 1:09:16.240
"Worried Wilson won't go to war."

1:09:16.406 --> 1:09:19.283
Idiots and fools.
There's nothing left to debate.

1:09:20.827 --> 1:09:24.581
Polly, do you think we can extend our network
to the White House?

1:09:25.165 --> 1:09:28.377
Most of their household staff were trained
in England, so it shouldn't be a problem.

1:09:28.544 --> 1:09:29.877
Right. Well, let's get to work, then.

1:09:30.045 --> 1:09:31.255
I'll get on to it right away.

1:09:31.421 --> 1:09:32.421
Thank you.

1:09:38.470 --> 1:09:39.555
Yes, come in.

1:09:41.515 --> 1:09:44.142
Your Grace. We have a visitor.

1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:45.602
Who is it?

1:09:46.019 --> 1:09:48.438
A friend of Conrad saying he's Lancelot...

1:09:48.604 --> 1:09:50.064
asking to see King Arthur.

1:09:50.148 --> 1:09:51.149
What?

1:09:52.109 --> 1:09:53.902
That brings back fond memories.

1:09:55.696 --> 1:09:56.822
Show him in, would you?

1:09:56.989 --> 1:09:57.990
Yes, sir.

1:09:58.866 --> 1:09:59.867
Sir.

1:10:02.452 --> 1:10:03.453
Who are you?

1:10:03.620 --> 1:10:06.373
Lance Corporal Reid of the Black Watch, sir.

1:10:07.291 --> 1:10:10.127
So then why are you wearing
a Grenadiers officer's uniform?

1:10:15.716 --> 1:10:17.926
This will explain it better than I can.

1:10:18.343 --> 1:10:20.262
It's a wee bit surreal, sir.

1:10:26.727 --> 1:10:27.728
Odd.

1:10:28.979 --> 1:10:30.647
It's a letter from Conrad.

1:10:31.815 --> 1:10:33.233
You're Lancelot.

1:10:35.319 --> 1:10:38.488
<i>Dear Father. I, too, can play games.</i>

1:10:39.615 --> 1:10:42.117
<i>I've swapped places with Archie Reid...</i>

1:10:42.618 --> 1:10:44.036
<i>the man in front of you.</i>

1:10:44.453 --> 1:10:45.454
Archie?

1:10:45.746 --> 1:10:47.414
<i>-He's a good man...
-</i>Yes, sir.

1:10:47.581 --> 1:10:52.377
<i>...who is simply following my orders
and is possibly as confused as you are.</i>

1:10:52.794 --> 1:10:55.839
<i>Please ensure my actions
don't get him into any trouble.</i>

1:10:56.548 --> 1:11:00.052
<i>Tomorrow I finally fulfill my wish
to go to the front.</i>

1:11:00.886 --> 1:11:06.099
<i>And in the meantime, I enclose a poem
which I thought you might appreciate.</i>

1:11:07.726 --> 1:11:08.727
<i>"Bent double...</i>

1:11:10.270 --> 1:11:13.148
<i>"like old beggars under sacks...</i>

1:11:14.816 --> 1:11:18.654
<i>"Knock-kneed, coughing like hags...</i>

1:11:19.988 --> 1:11:22.491
<i>"we cursed through sludge...</i>

1:11:23.575 --> 1:11:27.746
<i>"Till on the haunting flares
we turned our backs...</i>

1:11:28.872 --> 1:11:34.253
<i>"And towards our distant rest
began to trudge.</i>

1:11:39.007 --> 1:11:41.468
<i>"Men marched asleep.</i>

1:11:42.636 --> 1:11:46.265
<i>"Many had lost their boots,
but limped on...</i>

1:11:47.057 --> 1:11:48.600
<i>"blood-shod.</i>

1:11:50.519 --> 1:11:54.898
<i>"All went lame, all blind.</i>

1:11:55.816 --> 1:11:58.193
<i>"Drunk with fatigue...</i>

1:11:58.569 --> 1:12:00.571
<i>"deaf even to the hoots...</i>

1:12:00.737 --> 1:12:04.533
<i>"Of tired outstripped five-nines</i>

1:12:04.700 --> 1:12:06.410
<i>"that dropped behind."</i>

1:12:14.334 --> 1:12:15.335
New lads.

1:12:15.586 --> 1:12:16.879
Welcome to the front line.

1:12:17.045 --> 1:12:18.255
This trench will be your home
for the next six...

1:12:18.422 --> 1:12:21.008
I don't bloody believe it. Runner!

1:12:21.925 --> 1:12:23.385
Come on, lads!

1:12:33.770 --> 1:12:36.023
Well, come on, lads! Cover the man!

1:12:38.317 --> 1:12:40.319
Cover the man!

1:12:43.989 --> 1:12:45.157
Fire!

1:12:46.658 --> 1:12:47.701
Keep running!

1:12:53.665 --> 1:12:55.250
Hold your fire!

1:13:01.548 --> 1:13:02.925
Good effort, men.

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:06.094
This war never stops surprising me.

1:13:06.512 --> 1:13:09.932
A German wavin' a Union Jack! What's next?

1:13:10.724 --> 1:13:12.392
Allow me to answer that, Sergeant Major.

1:13:12.559 --> 1:13:13.936
Fall in!

1:13:16.772 --> 1:13:19.399
That runner was actually a British spy.

1:13:19.566 --> 1:13:21.235
He was bringing me vital information.

1:13:21.902 --> 1:13:25.489
Our country needs what he was carrying,
and I therefore need six volunteers.

1:13:26.114 --> 1:13:30.244
You will accompany me to retrieve
what's left of him as soon as it's dark.

1:13:34.081 --> 1:13:35.249
Very good, lad.

1:13:36.625 --> 1:13:37.709
Who else?

1:13:39.837 --> 1:13:40.879
Sergeant?

1:13:42.172 --> 1:13:45.050
You five. One step forward. March!

1:13:47.010 --> 1:13:49.096
Five more brave volunteers, sir.

1:13:49.263 --> 1:13:52.724
Excellent.
We move out at midnight.

1:14:33.473 --> 1:14:34.641
Hold your fire.

1:14:35.434 --> 1:14:39.271
If they hear us from the trenches,
we'll be fired upon from both sides.

1:14:54.369 --> 1:14:56.079
Boom.

1:16:14.741 --> 1:16:15.742
Please don't.

1:16:30.549 --> 1:16:31.758
I'm so sorry.

1:17:02.873 --> 1:17:03.874
What was that?

1:17:28.273 --> 1:17:29.274
It's over there.

1:17:29.358 --> 1:17:30.859
Don't shoot!

1:17:33.111 --> 1:17:34.112
No!

1:18:14.570 --> 1:18:16.071
Cease fire!

1:18:41.096 --> 1:18:42.681
First time out here, lad?

1:18:43.765 --> 1:18:44.766
Hey.

1:18:47.728 --> 1:18:48.937
Same side.

1:18:49.771 --> 1:18:51.356
Thank God for the Union Jack, eh?

1:18:55.736 --> 1:18:58.906
I can honestly say that my first time
was worse than losing this leg.

1:19:02.534 --> 1:19:05.871
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't be the one crying.

1:19:06.038 --> 1:19:08.540
Come over here and help me out. I'm freezing.

1:19:14.296 --> 1:19:17.216
Come here. Come on.

1:19:26.433 --> 1:19:29.311
I thought I knew what I wanted.

1:19:35.567 --> 1:19:37.819
My father warned me.

1:19:38.862 --> 1:19:42.074
My father warned me. I didn't listen...

1:19:43.659 --> 1:19:45.994
and now it all makes sense.

1:19:49.998 --> 1:19:52.751
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

1:19:53.752 --> 1:19:57.840
Well, I suggest
we solve both our problems, yeah?

1:19:58.382 --> 1:19:59.842
Look.

1:20:00.592 --> 1:20:02.594
I need to get this to high command.

1:20:03.011 --> 1:20:05.597
The contents could help end this bloody war.

1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:09.935
As I won't be walking any time soon...

1:20:11.144 --> 1:20:13.939
I suggest you finish the mission...

1:20:16.149 --> 1:20:18.277
and go home to a hero's welcome.

1:20:18.819 --> 1:20:23.699
No, no. No. Off we go to a hero's welcome.

1:20:43.886 --> 1:20:46.054
It's okay. I've got you.

1:20:55.314 --> 1:20:57.357
Shit. Hurry!

1:20:59.568 --> 1:21:01.695
Covering fire!

1:21:01.862 --> 1:21:03.155
Give them cover, lads!

1:21:06.575 --> 1:21:07.576
Fucking move!

1:21:11.371 --> 1:21:13.207
Take out the machine gunner!

1:21:13.665 --> 1:21:14.917
Cover him!

1:21:20.547 --> 1:21:23.091
Go!

1:21:23.258 --> 1:21:26.011
Run!

1:21:26.178 --> 1:21:28.472
-Let's go, man! Run!
-Run! Run! Run!

1:22:07.970 --> 1:22:10.013
You all right?
You all right?

1:22:10.556 --> 1:22:14.726
Jesus Christ! You were amazin'!
I've never seen anything like it.

1:22:14.893 --> 1:22:17.354
What the bloody hell
were you doing over there in the first place?

1:22:18.814 --> 1:22:20.899
You better ask him. Ask him.

1:22:21.358 --> 1:22:23.277
He'll explain everything.

1:22:24.361 --> 1:22:25.988
He took the full force of that blast, sir.

1:22:26.154 --> 1:22:28.407
Yeah. But at least you made it back, son.

1:22:28.991 --> 1:22:32.786
I tell you, if that ain't worth
a Victoria Cross, I don't know what is.

1:22:32.995 --> 1:22:34.413
I must carry on the mission.

1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:36.790
We need to get this
to high command immediately.

1:22:36.957 --> 1:22:39.877
I'll take you there myself.
What's your name, soldier?

1:22:41.003 --> 1:22:43.922
Archie. Lance Corporal Archie Reid.

1:22:44.089 --> 1:22:45.090
Archie Reid, did you say?

1:22:46.758 --> 1:22:47.759
Yes.

1:22:48.177 --> 1:22:49.261
That's right.

1:22:49.428 --> 1:22:50.929
Lance Corporal Archie Reid?

1:22:51.805 --> 1:22:53.974
Dog Platoon, First Battalion,
the Black Watch?

1:22:54.808 --> 1:22:55.809
Aye.

1:22:58.103 --> 1:22:59.897
Is that your best Scottish accent?

1:23:00.522 --> 1:23:01.523
You're not Archie Reid.

1:23:02.107 --> 1:23:04.109
Lance Corporal Archie Reid's
a friend of mine.

1:23:04.276 --> 1:23:05.986
And I've been looking for him all night.
So who are you?

1:23:06.153 --> 1:23:10.199
Yes, yes. You're right.
There's a simple explanation.

1:23:10.616 --> 1:23:11.950
-I'm not Archie Reid.
-Fuckin' German spy.

1:23:12.117 --> 1:23:13.202
I'm Conra...

1:23:34.681 --> 1:23:36.308
<i>Your son was killed in action, sir.</i>

1:23:49.655 --> 1:23:50.656
What?

1:24:33.866 --> 1:24:34.950
Polly.

1:24:38.495 --> 1:24:39.663
Polly.

1:24:51.466 --> 1:24:53.051
My son.

1:25:03.395 --> 1:25:04.605
Why?

1:25:16.658 --> 1:25:20.746
<i>"If in some smothering dreams...</i>

1:25:20.913 --> 1:25:25.542
<i>"you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in...</i>

1:25:26.376 --> 1:25:30.839
<i>"And watch the white eyes
writhing in his face...</i>

1:25:33.467 --> 1:25:38.764
"His hanging face,
like a devil's sick of sin...

1:25:39.389 --> 1:25:42.684
"If you could hear, at every jolt...

1:25:42.976 --> 1:25:47.231
"the blood, come gargling
from the froth-corrupted lungs...

1:25:48.607 --> 1:25:51.193
"Obscene as cancer...

1:25:52.236 --> 1:25:54.279
"bitter as the cud...

1:25:54.655 --> 1:26:00.244
"Of vile, incurable sores
on innocent tongues...

1:26:01.453 --> 1:26:02.829
"My friend...

1:26:03.956 --> 1:26:08.168
"you would not tell with such high zest...

1:26:08.335 --> 1:26:11.046
"To children ardent for...

1:26:11.672 --> 1:26:13.841
"some desperate glory...

1:26:14.007 --> 1:26:15.884
"The old Lie...

1:26:17.344 --> 1:26:20.389
<i>"Dulce et decorum est...</i>

1:26:21.473 --> 1:26:24.059
<i>"Pro patria mori."</i>

1:26:25.936 --> 1:26:28.981
It is sweet and proper...

1:26:29.982 --> 1:26:33.360
to die for one's country.

1:26:50.836 --> 1:26:54.256
I, Nikolai Aleksandrovich Romanov...

1:26:54.423 --> 1:26:56.466
Emperor of Russia...

1:26:56.633 --> 1:26:58.969
do hereby declare
my irrevocable determination...

1:26:59.136 --> 1:27:02.306
to renounce the throne for myself
and my descendants...

1:27:02.472 --> 1:27:05.809
through this instrument of abdication...

1:27:07.644 --> 1:27:09.188
immediately.

1:27:35.547 --> 1:27:37.633
The documents Conrad recovered...

1:27:38.509 --> 1:27:40.552
turned out to be the German ambassador's
original handwritten telegram that I cracked.

1:27:44.598 --> 1:27:47.226
It's the concrete proof America needed.

1:27:48.018 --> 1:27:50.854
America will now have to join the war.

1:27:51.021 --> 1:27:53.982
Conrad succeeded where we all failed.

1:28:04.826 --> 1:28:05.953
My Shepherd.

1:28:07.287 --> 1:28:08.664
There is a code of honor...

1:28:09.039 --> 1:28:13.502
and using a distraction to your own advantage
breaks that code.

1:28:13.669 --> 1:28:15.295
-What?
-Apologies, my Shepherd...

1:28:15.462 --> 1:28:17.256
but I have disturbing news.

1:28:17.589 --> 1:28:20.717
While your plan for Russia
has been a great success...

1:28:20.884 --> 1:28:24.638
my plan to keep America out of the war
has backfired.

1:28:25.138 --> 1:28:28.058
The American president is about
to be given the actual telegram...

1:28:28.225 --> 1:28:29.726
I forced the kaiser to send.

1:28:30.102 --> 1:28:34.356
Such undeniable proof could provoke
the Americans into entering the war.

1:28:39.778 --> 1:28:41.113
<i>En garde.</i>

1:28:46.910 --> 1:28:50.247
I like a man who will admit to his mistakes,
I do.

1:28:50.706 --> 1:28:54.710
But I like more a woman who can fix them.

1:28:54.877 --> 1:28:59.464
Have our American friend Dupont
get Mata into the White House.

1:28:59.673 --> 1:29:03.969
Time for you to work your magic
on the president, Mata.

1:29:04.136 --> 1:29:05.512
Now, go on.

1:29:06.930 --> 1:29:11.518
It's time to show the president
who the real boss is.

1:29:21.111 --> 1:29:22.529
Will Your Grace be having tea?

1:29:25.908 --> 1:29:27.743
It's scotch time.

1:29:28.577 --> 1:29:30.287
Twenty-four hours a day.

1:30:07.699 --> 1:30:10.536
For the last time,
I don't want any fucking tea!

1:30:10.702 --> 1:30:12.120
Neither do I.

1:30:13.664 --> 1:30:14.831
Sir.

1:30:17.793 --> 1:30:20.963
Though it looks like you could use
a strong one to sober up.

1:30:22.339 --> 1:30:24.299
I'm afraid it'll take more than that, sir.

1:30:24.466 --> 1:30:26.760
Oh, well, maybe this will do the trick.

1:30:26.927 --> 1:30:28.929
Russia's pulled out of the war.

1:30:29.596 --> 1:30:32.099
The British Empire faces imminent defeat.

1:30:32.933 --> 1:30:35.561
America still refuses to join.

1:30:36.687 --> 1:30:39.606
I personally telephoned President Wilson.

1:30:40.941 --> 1:30:43.026
He didn't deign to receive my call.

1:30:43.193 --> 1:30:45.863
So, they got to him as well.

1:30:46.029 --> 1:30:47.030
Indeed.

1:30:48.574 --> 1:30:50.576
The kaiser's blockade is working.

1:30:51.326 --> 1:30:53.120
The people are hungry.

1:30:53.871 --> 1:30:56.957
The next revolution might be here.

1:30:58.500 --> 1:31:03.672
I've even been advised to change
my German surname Saxe-Coburg to Windsor.

1:31:04.506 --> 1:31:05.674
More English.

1:31:08.135 --> 1:31:10.012
I'm afraid, then, sir...

1:31:10.596 --> 1:31:12.639
that England is doomed.

1:31:20.063 --> 1:31:21.690
I wanted to give you this.

1:31:23.066 --> 1:31:24.109
For Conrad.

1:31:24.860 --> 1:31:27.487
A true hero.

1:31:29.698 --> 1:31:32.117
A man who knew his duty.

1:31:43.420 --> 1:31:46.798
Enough of this self-pitying poppycock.

1:31:47.382 --> 1:31:48.634
If it were just you...

1:31:49.218 --> 1:31:53.472
you and I, in our grief,
I'd say do as you will.

1:31:54.056 --> 1:31:57.476
Drown in drink, and I'd join you.

1:31:58.435 --> 1:31:59.978
But he's watching.

1:32:02.397 --> 1:32:05.108
And he would have been such a better man.

1:32:09.488 --> 1:32:11.031
But he can't.

1:32:12.241 --> 1:32:16.078
He won't be that. Not anymore.

1:32:16.578 --> 1:32:20.916
So, you must, in his stead...

1:32:22.501 --> 1:32:25.504
be the man your son would have been.

1:32:32.386 --> 1:32:35.347
Regretfully, I can no longer remain
in your service.

1:32:37.182 --> 1:32:38.642
Forgive me, my lady.

1:32:47.442 --> 1:32:49.486
My heart is broken as well.

1:32:50.529 --> 1:32:52.906
Polly. Polly.

1:32:54.867 --> 1:32:56.743
I do not accept your resignation.

1:32:59.538 --> 1:33:00.581
But...

1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:06.086
I will accept a very strong cup of tea.

1:33:38.994 --> 1:33:40.120
Looking better, Your Grace.

1:33:42.122 --> 1:33:43.832
Feeling better, Polly.

1:33:45.751 --> 1:33:46.960
So, what have I missed?

1:33:47.461 --> 1:33:49.755
We followed your last sober order...

1:33:49.922 --> 1:33:52.925
<i>and extended our network to the White House.</i>

1:33:53.091 --> 1:33:54.885
<i>The president's butler informed us that since
receiving the telegram Conrad recovered...</i>

1:33:57.387 --> 1:33:59.306
<i>the president hasn't been himself.</i>

1:33:59.473 --> 1:34:03.060
This may be the proof I asked for.
But remember my election promise.

1:34:03.227 --> 1:34:04.811
Out of the war, not in.

1:34:04.978 --> 1:34:07.314
Douglas, get me a Statesman on the rocks,
now!

1:34:07.898 --> 1:34:11.610
<i>Constantly engaged in top-secret
conversations with his embassy in London.</i>

1:34:11.902 --> 1:34:14.154
And ignoring all advice to go to war.

1:34:14.321 --> 1:34:16.406
And do we have someone in the embassy?

1:34:16.573 --> 1:34:17.741
Of course.

1:34:18.200 --> 1:34:19.284
Mr. President...

1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:21.036
I don't know how to proceed.

1:34:21.245 --> 1:34:23.789
<i>We're meeting to discuss her new demands.</i>

1:34:23.956 --> 1:34:25.415
-I see.
-She was very convincing.

1:34:25.582 --> 1:34:28.502
And she suggests we make
an unannounced visit at 3:00.

1:34:28.669 --> 1:34:32.089
Right, well.
We had better get a move on, then.

1:34:46.311 --> 1:34:47.479
Good afternoon.

1:34:47.646 --> 1:34:50.858
Please inform the ambassador
the Duke of Oxford is here to see him.

1:34:52.651 --> 1:34:53.861
Yes, Your Grace.

1:34:55.445 --> 1:34:56.864
Mr. Ambassador.

1:35:02.744 --> 1:35:03.954
<i>Why did you kill my friend?</i>

1:35:04.413 --> 1:35:05.706
It was the alcohol.

1:35:06.081 --> 1:35:07.082
I was overcome.

1:35:08.375 --> 1:35:10.460
<i>Thank you for your time, Mr. Ambassador.</i>

1:35:17.676 --> 1:35:19.636
If you wouldn't mind...

1:35:20.429 --> 1:35:23.682
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help admiring your scarf.

1:35:23.849 --> 1:35:25.559
An exquisite cashmere.

1:35:25.726 --> 1:35:27.102
Yes, it's very rare.

1:35:27.269 --> 1:35:30.189
Do you know the test
of a truly pure cashmere?

1:35:31.523 --> 1:35:32.566
A ring.

1:35:33.025 --> 1:35:37.070
Yet, happily, you do not wear one.

1:35:37.738 --> 1:35:39.698
You are...

1:35:41.074 --> 1:35:42.117
mistaken.

1:35:42.492 --> 1:35:43.869
Now that...

1:35:45.078 --> 1:35:46.246
is disappointing.

1:35:46.413 --> 1:35:48.081
But this...

1:35:49.666 --> 1:35:50.667
is not.

1:36:02.763 --> 1:36:04.515
I believe it's ungentlemanly
to hurt a woman...

1:36:04.681 --> 1:36:06.558
but since the fate of the world
hangs in the balance...

1:36:06.683 --> 1:36:07.935
I'm going to bend the rules.

1:36:08.101 --> 1:36:12.147
Now tell me who's behind this,
or so help me you'll never breathe again.

1:36:13.315 --> 1:36:15.108
You will have to kill me.

1:36:26.119 --> 1:36:27.579
Ambassador.

1:36:29.164 --> 1:36:30.916
-Is she dead?
-No.

1:36:31.333 --> 1:36:33.836
She has an extreme case of hypoxia.

1:36:34.127 --> 1:36:38.882
She'll be fine, and so will you,
as long as we have an honest conversation.

1:36:46.598 --> 1:36:50.227
What you're lookin' at
is the lady you strangled.

1:36:50.394 --> 1:36:53.063
She filmed herself seducing the president...

1:36:53.230 --> 1:36:57.734
and is now blackmailing us
to not even think about entering the war.

1:36:57.901 --> 1:37:01.530
We cannot risk the integrity
of the U.S. presidency.

1:37:01.697 --> 1:37:03.073
I'm sure.

1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:05.951
Now, if we can get that negative...

1:37:06.118 --> 1:37:09.997
then we will happily join England
and put Germany out of business.

1:37:10.163 --> 1:37:12.457
Well, I suggest you interrogate her.

1:37:12.791 --> 1:37:16.628
And I'll follow up on this.

1:37:18.672 --> 1:37:21.717
This is cashmere from the Kamaliro goat.

1:37:22.718 --> 1:37:23.760
It's very rare.

1:37:24.428 --> 1:37:25.596
Where does it come from?

1:37:26.471 --> 1:37:29.183
Mr. Collins, cashmere book number one,
please.

1:37:31.602 --> 1:37:32.603
Thank you.

1:37:33.854 --> 1:37:36.481
It comes from here.

1:37:36.648 --> 1:37:40.277
The only place in the world
where the Kamaliro goat breeds.

1:37:40.444 --> 1:37:41.445
Excellent.

1:37:41.612 --> 1:37:42.613
Shola...

1:37:42.946 --> 1:37:45.449
we're going into the cashmere business.

1:38:03.133 --> 1:38:06.428
I can see six men guarding the lift.

1:38:08.597 --> 1:38:09.765
If you can call it that.

1:38:09.932 --> 1:38:12.809
Give the word
and their numbers will be reduced.

1:38:13.519 --> 1:38:16.855
Oh, no, Polly. The film's negative
is going to be up there.

1:38:17.022 --> 1:38:18.440
And that's our real prize.

1:38:18.607 --> 1:38:21.568
If these guards are alerted,
then I don't think we'll make it up.

1:38:21.735 --> 1:38:23.862
It's vital that we control this lift.

1:38:29.493 --> 1:38:33.038
This is called a parachute.

1:38:33.455 --> 1:38:36.375
It means that one can
jump out of a plane safely.

1:38:37.709 --> 1:38:38.710
So...

1:38:39.461 --> 1:38:41.964
tomorrow at dawn
I'll fly the plane over the mountain...

1:38:42.130 --> 1:38:43.632
and Shola will jump out.

1:38:44.216 --> 1:38:46.176
You land with the parachute...

1:38:46.343 --> 1:38:50.889
take control of the lift,
and then you fire this flare.

1:38:51.265 --> 1:38:54.685
It's a signal to me,
by which time I'll have landed the plane...

1:38:54.852 --> 1:38:58.647
made my way over to the bottom of the lift,
while Polly provides cover.

1:38:59.481 --> 1:39:02.442
Sir, I could do anything for you...

1:39:02.609 --> 1:39:05.112
but I cannot jump out of an airplane.

1:39:05.487 --> 1:39:07.322
And it's not that I wouldn't try...

1:39:08.615 --> 1:39:10.742
it's that I know I'd let you down.

1:39:11.577 --> 1:39:14.079
Yes. Well, I appreciate
your fear of heights...

1:39:14.246 --> 1:39:17.499
but I am the only one who can fly. So...

1:39:17.791 --> 1:39:19.585
But you wouldn't have to land the plane.

1:39:19.751 --> 1:39:21.962
You just have to land yourself.

1:39:27.092 --> 1:39:32.014
Well, it would be bad form to ask a man
to do something that I wouldn't do myself.

1:39:32.181 --> 1:39:36.018
All right, Shola, get ready for my signal.

1:39:37.477 --> 1:39:38.979
We go at dawn.

1:43:41.388 --> 1:43:42.389
Shit!

1:44:19.510 --> 1:44:22.763
That's it. That's it.

1:44:34.525 --> 1:44:36.401
Answer the question, Dupont.

1:44:36.568 --> 1:44:39.446
Do you know where Mata is?

1:44:39.613 --> 1:44:42.699
-No. I...
-Well, you fuckin' should.

1:44:42.866 --> 1:44:45.244
Because I sent her to the American Embassy,
and she hasn't been seen since!

1:44:49.498 --> 1:44:50.874
Do you see this?

1:44:51.041 --> 1:44:54.545
If the American president
thinks he can fuck me too...

1:44:54.711 --> 1:44:56.547
he is very much mistaken.

1:44:56.713 --> 1:45:01.552
Take this negative to the press,
and it will ruin his reputation.

1:45:01.718 --> 1:45:05.389
War will be the last thing
on the Americans' mind.

1:45:05.556 --> 1:45:10.853
And when the scandal is over,
make sure the new president is in our pocket!

1:45:11.061 --> 1:45:13.021
Go on. Run! Run!

1:45:13.397 --> 1:45:14.982
All the way to the White House.

1:45:21.029 --> 1:45:22.239
Let's check the other side.

1:45:22.406 --> 1:45:24.116
Let's go around to the south.

1:45:26.660 --> 1:45:28.871
Make it snappy, pal!

1:45:35.294 --> 1:45:36.295
Hey!

1:45:43.719 --> 1:45:45.345
What the hell?

1:45:52.311 --> 1:45:53.812
Buddy, what's the holdup?

1:46:02.237 --> 1:46:03.238
Look!

1:46:04.031 --> 1:46:05.199
There's the signal.

1:46:05.407 --> 1:46:07.701
Get to the lift. I'll cover you.

1:46:21.256 --> 1:46:22.257
Up on the hill!

1:47:23.569 --> 1:47:26.071
Who the hell is that guy?

1:47:46.550 --> 1:47:50.637
Shola! Stop fuckin' about!
Get on that counterweight!

1:48:06.236 --> 1:48:07.237
Fuck!

1:48:36.683 --> 1:48:37.684
Thank God you're here.

1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:41.438
This plan hasn't exactly gone by the numbers.

1:48:47.736 --> 1:48:49.530
Polly. Do you have the film?

1:48:49.696 --> 1:48:51.823
I have the negative in my hand, Your Grace.

1:48:52.407 --> 1:48:53.742
Well done.

1:48:53.867 --> 1:48:55.494
So we have what we came for.

1:48:55.661 --> 1:48:58.914
Yes. But the cause of all this mayhem
is still in there.

1:48:59.248 --> 1:49:01.792
Enough of dealing with tentacles, Shola.

1:49:01.959 --> 1:49:03.710
It's time to cut off the head.

1:49:04.545 --> 1:49:06.338
It's good to have you back, sir.

1:50:01.727 --> 1:50:06.106
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

1:50:06.273 --> 1:50:12.446
The thorn in my side
has just been a peace-loving English rose.

1:50:13.238 --> 1:50:17.159
The Duke of Oxford. Good day to you, sir!

1:50:17.951 --> 1:50:19.745
You are the very symbol...

1:50:19.912 --> 1:50:22.122
of everything I'm tryin' to destroy.

1:50:22.289 --> 1:50:27.419
Aristocrats like you stole my parents' mill
in Scotland when I was a lad.

1:50:27.878 --> 1:50:31.006
Entitlement has "title" in it
for a reason, no?

1:50:32.883 --> 1:50:36.053
I'm gonna fucking love killing you.

1:50:36.220 --> 1:50:38.931
Come to papa, you posh prick!

1:50:50.025 --> 1:50:51.026
I'm out.

1:51:07.668 --> 1:51:10.504
The sound of silence.

1:51:11.213 --> 1:51:14.716
It's my understanding that you, Duke...

1:51:14.883 --> 1:51:16.927
are a formidable swordsman.

1:51:17.845 --> 1:51:23.016
What say we end this shite as gentlemen?

1:51:23.809 --> 1:51:25.102
After all...

1:51:25.727 --> 1:51:28.146
manners maketh man.

1:51:28.772 --> 1:51:32.025
A gentleman does not hide in the shadows.

1:51:33.193 --> 1:51:34.194
Aye.

1:51:47.082 --> 1:51:48.709
Surprise.

1:51:57.009 --> 1:51:58.218
Morton.

1:52:00.012 --> 1:52:01.013
You see...

1:52:01.597 --> 1:52:04.850
<i>a little misplaced trust
allows one to get away with murder.</i>

1:52:05.017 --> 1:52:08.187
This debate should happen
after we have won the war.

1:52:09.521 --> 1:52:13.150
I suggest we go to Russia,
and we sort it out ourselves.

1:52:13.317 --> 1:52:14.943
<i>And in poor Kitchener's case...</i>

1:52:17.446 --> 1:52:18.906
<i>quite literally.</i>

1:52:22.701 --> 1:52:24.161
Spoken like a true traitor.

1:52:24.620 --> 1:52:27.080
As far as I'm concerned, his blood...

1:52:30.209 --> 1:52:32.503
that's on your grubby hands.

1:52:35.047 --> 1:52:36.215
Two on one?

1:52:37.174 --> 1:52:39.551
Behaving like a true gentleman.

1:52:44.056 --> 1:52:45.724
You're delusional.

1:52:46.433 --> 1:52:47.976
And you've killed millions.

1:52:48.685 --> 1:52:51.897
What say one more, for good measure?

1:52:52.689 --> 1:52:53.690
Hey!

1:53:31.019 --> 1:53:32.354
Come on, old man.

1:53:32.896 --> 1:53:33.981
Get up.

1:53:35.107 --> 1:53:36.608
I said, get up!

1:54:58.232 --> 1:55:00.943
Fuck this gentleman shite.

1:55:24.925 --> 1:55:26.343
Fuck's sake.

1:55:33.392 --> 1:55:35.269
You bastard.

1:56:12.055 --> 1:56:15.976
Give my regards to dear old Kitch, yeah?

1:56:34.494 --> 1:56:37.414
You can't do it. You can't let me fall.

1:56:37.831 --> 1:56:42.419
It goes against your every belief.
You are a pacifist.

1:56:43.295 --> 1:56:47.299
And I'm now completely reliant
on your mercy, old boy.

1:56:47.466 --> 1:56:50.928
You're right. I shouldn't let you fall.

1:56:51.512 --> 1:56:56.600
Only now I have become the man
that my son would have been.

1:56:59.853 --> 1:57:00.854
You...

1:57:30.175 --> 1:57:31.176
Sir.

1:57:31.552 --> 1:57:33.428
Shola, are you all right?

1:57:34.429 --> 1:57:36.557
We've been through worse, Your Grace.

1:57:38.100 --> 1:57:42.646
So, you'd jump in front of a bullet for me,
but not out of an airplane?

1:57:44.189 --> 1:57:45.899
So it would seem.

1:57:47.150 --> 1:57:48.527
Thank you, my friend.

1:57:48.694 --> 1:57:50.153
My pleasure.

1:57:51.905 --> 1:57:53.365
So, Shola.

1:57:54.074 --> 1:57:56.577
How are we going to get down from here?

1:58:09.256 --> 1:58:10.674
Come in.

1:58:11.341 --> 1:58:14.720
Mr. President, Chef has made
your favorite peanut butter cookies.

1:58:19.975 --> 1:58:21.351
Thank you.

1:58:39.161 --> 1:58:42.122
Get me the generals, immediately.

1:58:46.418 --> 1:58:48.670
We're goin' to war!

1:59:04.811 --> 1:59:08.357
This victory is all down to you...

1:59:08.524 --> 1:59:11.527
and your fine son, Conrad.

1:59:11.902 --> 1:59:14.988
And the courage of so many others, sir.

1:59:15.155 --> 1:59:16.490
Of course.

1:59:18.116 --> 1:59:20.869
Britain thanks you. And I thank you...

1:59:21.203 --> 1:59:24.706
for ensuring that I didn't meet the same fate
as my cousins.

1:59:25.749 --> 1:59:28.544
<i>Wilhelm's abdication was understandable...</i>

1:59:29.753 --> 1:59:31.755
<i>but what happened to Nicholas...</i>

1:59:34.633 --> 1:59:36.093
was despicable.

1:59:36.260 --> 1:59:37.928
It was, sir.

1:59:38.095 --> 1:59:41.974
I owe you a great personal debt
that I still have my crown.

1:59:44.560 --> 1:59:49.690
In that case, would you meet me tomorrow
at Kingsman, 3:00?

1:59:49.857 --> 1:59:50.858
A tailor shop?

1:59:50.983 --> 1:59:51.984
Yes, sir.

1:59:52.109 --> 1:59:54.778
Number 11, Savile Row.

1:59:59.992 --> 2:00:03.245
All of us here today are united...

2:00:03.412 --> 2:00:09.251
sadly, in losing our sons and friends
in this terrible war.

2:00:09.418 --> 2:00:14.256
What happened to this generation of young men
must never happen again.

2:00:14.423 --> 2:00:17.634
I believe the terms of Versailles
are too onerous...

2:00:17.801 --> 2:00:21.305
too extreme,
and could precipitate another war.

2:00:22.347 --> 2:00:26.393
What the world needs is an organization
that can channel its resources...

2:00:26.560 --> 2:00:30.981
towards preserving peace
and protecting life.

2:00:31.148 --> 2:00:33.984
An independent intelligence agency...

2:00:34.151 --> 2:00:37.154
operating at the highest level
of discretion...

2:00:37.321 --> 2:00:42.701
above the politics and bureaucracy
of government-run spy organizations.

2:00:43.452 --> 2:00:44.703
To that end...

2:00:45.537 --> 2:00:48.540
I have acquired this shop.

2:00:48.707 --> 2:00:53.629
And I propose that we become
the founding members of...

2:00:54.296 --> 2:00:56.965
the Kingsman agency.

2:00:58.634 --> 2:01:00.552
My code name will be...

2:01:02.346 --> 2:01:03.472
Arthur.

2:01:04.014 --> 2:01:07.017
And if you agree to join me,
you may turn over your place card...

2:01:07.184 --> 2:01:09.645
where you will find your own code name.

2:01:12.356 --> 2:01:14.399
I am Galahad.

2:01:18.487 --> 2:01:19.947
I am Lancelot.

2:01:21.532 --> 2:01:24.409
I am Bedivere.

2:01:27.663 --> 2:01:29.623
I am Percival.

2:01:29.790 --> 2:01:30.874
Excellent.

2:01:32.167 --> 2:01:35.254
And this is Merlin...

2:01:35.420 --> 2:01:37.506
who will be our quartermaster.

2:01:39.299 --> 2:01:42.719
May our sons and friends rest in peace.

2:01:43.053 --> 2:01:46.306
And long live the Kingsman.

2:01:47.641 --> 2:01:49.476
The Kingsman.

2:03:47.761 --> 2:03:50.764
Now it's time to address
the balance of my new flock.

2:03:50.931 --> 2:03:53.392
Thanks to you, Comrade,
our left hand is strong.

2:03:53.559 --> 2:03:57.271
But as you once said,
our right hand now needs strengthening.

2:03:58.355 --> 2:03:59.648
Come in.

2:04:05.112 --> 2:04:06.363
Don't be shy.

2:04:06.780 --> 2:04:07.948
Come, come.

2:04:12.452 --> 2:04:13.453
My Shepherd.

2:04:14.121 --> 2:04:18.625
This young man will come to rival
your position in this world, my friend.

2:04:19.710 --> 2:04:21.837
It is an honor, Comrade Lenin.

2:04:23.922 --> 2:04:25.591
And your name?

2:04:27.342 --> 2:04:29.094
Adolf Hitler.
