00:17.951 --> 00:19.818
Woman:
<i>Dear diary,</i>

00:19.820 --> 00:23.155
<i>It was a Saturday,</i>
<i>the 3rd of September,</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:26.091
<i>That the world as I had known</i>
<i>was forever doomed.</i>

00:30.330 --> 00:32.965
<i>The shadows that had</i>
<i>sheltered me were banished</i>

00:32.967 --> 00:35.434
<i>By the blinding light</i>
<i>of scrutiny.</i>

00:38.038 --> 00:41.440
<i>I knew I was about to enter</i>
<i>the gates of hell.</i>

00:43.510 --> 00:46.812
<i>But like the inescapable</i>
<i>pull of gravity,</i>

00:46.814 --> 00:50.883
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>I could do about it.</i>

00:52.652 --> 00:54.953
(insects trilling)

00:58.224 --> 01:00.492
(dog barking,
rooster crowing in distance)

01:00.494 --> 01:03.062
(pop music playing faintly)

01:09.836 --> 01:12.071
¶ doo-da-doo, doo-da-doo

01:12.073 --> 01:14.039
¶ doo-da-doo-a-loo-a-loo,
doo-da-doo...¶

01:14.041 --> 01:16.642
(engine turns off, music stops)

01:47.740 --> 01:50.142
Mrs. Tattler?

01:51.878 --> 01:54.379
Mrs. Tattler,
it's bill palmer.

01:54.381 --> 01:57.149
Your milkman.

02:08.728 --> 02:11.029
Mrs. Tattler?

02:31.417 --> 02:34.353
(clock ticking)

02:37.957 --> 02:39.491
(shuddering breaths)

02:43.930 --> 02:47.399
Oh, sweet jesus!

02:48.601 --> 02:51.036
(clock cuckooing)

02:52.105 --> 02:54.540
(thumping upstairs)

02:55.942 --> 02:57.543
(stairs creak)

03:12.692 --> 03:15.761
(eerie, indistinct whispering)

03:33.646 --> 03:36.048
(whispering stops)

03:37.550 --> 03:40.185
(gasps)

03:40.187 --> 03:41.453
(screams)

03:46.326 --> 03:48.894
Straight to the operating suite!

04:04.010 --> 04:07.079
(retching)

04:11.517 --> 04:15.020
One bladder.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.256
Three kidneys--

04:17.258 --> 04:20.993
Two on the left and
one on the right.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.864
Nurse?

04:25.866 --> 04:27.532
Are you writing this down?

04:27.534 --> 04:29.134
Yes, doctor.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.778
Four lungs.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.913
Two hearts

04:41.915 --> 04:45.317
With a shared
circulatory system.

04:51.557 --> 04:53.558
Woman:
<i>"the victim, 63-year old</i>

04:53.560 --> 04:55.260
<i>"eudora tattler, was thought</i>

04:55.262 --> 04:57.229
<i>"by neighbors</i>
<i>to have lived alone.</i>

04:57.231 --> 04:59.898
<i>"the unfortunate creature</i>
<i>discovered at the crime scene,</i>

04:59.900 --> 05:02.968
<i>"who witnesses are describing</i>
<i>as 'monstrously deformed,'</i>

05:02.970 --> 05:05.103
<i>May be a relation,</i>
<i>sources say."</i>

05:05.105 --> 05:08.073
I don't blame the old lady
for keeping it hidden.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.908
If I gave birth
to something like that,

05:09.910 --> 05:12.144
I'd drown it
in the bathtub first thing.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.545
Penny, that's terrible.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.114
You better not
let miss kilgreen

05:16.116 --> 05:17.616
Hear you talking like that.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.919
Or catch you wearing
red lips on the floor.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.121
She's already got
it in for you.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.657
I have rounds.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.264
Can I help you?

05:32.266 --> 05:36.168
I have come to visit
my poor ailing aunt.

05:36.170 --> 05:41.173
But... I have trouble
navigating your halls.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.309
Um, you're not
supposed to smoke

05:44.311 --> 05:45.344
In this wing, ma'am.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.112
Oh, it's fine.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.448
It's lucky strike.
It's good for you.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.016
Here.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.351
Have one.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.585
Go ahead.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.989
Go ahead, try it.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.791
So, tell me,

05:59.793 --> 06:01.960
My peppermint angel.
(chuckles)

06:01.962 --> 06:05.297
I could not help
but see a police officer

06:05.299 --> 06:06.998
Sitting outside
one of the doors.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.868
Yeah. That's on account
of what's in there.

06:11.637 --> 06:12.971
And what is in there?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.640
I read in the papers
that something quite

06:15.642 --> 06:18.143
Extraordinary was
brought in here.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.644
"extraordinary"?

06:19.646 --> 06:22.013
I guess to the bumpkins
in this town maybe.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.815
I take it you're not fond

06:23.817 --> 06:25.984
Of the sleepy little hamlet
of jupiter.

06:25.986 --> 06:29.187
So, to fill the idle hours,
you volunteer here?

06:29.189 --> 06:30.389
Hell, my mom made me.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.823
It was this or reform school.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.392
Oh... You are young

06:33.394 --> 06:34.893
And full of life.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.895
You should not
be surrounded by

06:36.897 --> 06:38.897
Death and disease.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.400
(speaks german)

06:41.402 --> 06:45.036
Life is to be lived.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.906
You said it, sister.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.207
(laughs)
here.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.576
I know what a girl
like you needs.

06:53.546 --> 06:56.248
"fraulein elsa's
cabinet of curiosities."

06:56.250 --> 06:58.583
What is it?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.585
Only by entering

07:00.587 --> 07:03.455
Will you learn its secrets.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.531
Whoa, miss.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.533
You don't want to go
in there, believe me.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.368
Will I find a monster?

07:16.370 --> 07:19.571
That's what the papers
are saying, officer pipes.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.872
Papers ain't lying.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.041
All the more reason to allow in

07:23.043 --> 07:24.543
Just a touch of human kindness.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.111
Don't you agree?

07:40.560 --> 07:41.827
(door creaks)

08:12.825 --> 08:15.894
¶

08:42.855 --> 08:43.989
(gasps)

08:43.991 --> 08:46.024
Oh...

08:47.960 --> 08:52.030
(quietly speaking german)

08:55.668 --> 08:58.036
(gasps)

09:01.874 --> 09:03.875
(both gasp)

09:06.812 --> 09:09.014
I don't know you.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.917
What pretty girls you are.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.659
And so fortunate

09:20.661 --> 09:23.128
To have a sister.

10:41.073 --> 10:43.642
You will need something
to wear when you leave here.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.410
I will be honest.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.746
It was quite
eerie out there.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.748
At your farmhouse.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.149
Violence lingers in the air...

10:51.151 --> 10:53.985
Why is she being so nice to us?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.120
<i>She wants something.</i>

10:55.122 --> 10:55.920
You know they called you

10:55.922 --> 10:57.489
Dim-witted in the newspapers,

10:57.491 --> 10:59.157
Because you don't speak.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.496
But someone reads.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.598
And my intuition tells me

11:06.600 --> 11:10.335
It wasn't your dear
departed mom.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.607
Betty grable is
my favorite.

11:15.609 --> 11:18.843
There's a bit
of betty about you.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.781
Sensual lips.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.582
That sassy smile.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.828
I've had a long,
complicated love affair

11:36.830 --> 11:38.163
With show business
myself, you know?

11:38.165 --> 11:39.864
Have you ever met betty?

11:39.866 --> 11:42.701
Our paths nearly crossed.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.805
But fate intervened.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.872
When we lived in alabama,

11:47.874 --> 11:49.874
I saw her in tin pan alley.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.543
Shut up! What's wrong with you?

11:53.012 --> 11:54.979
Anyway.

11:54.981 --> 11:58.183
Let's have a look
at you, lefty, hmm?

11:58.185 --> 11:59.884
You're no betty grable.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.987
But...

12:02.989 --> 12:06.624
You do remind one
of jean arthur.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.999
(coughs)

12:15.001 --> 12:18.169
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.472
Either of you?

12:22.908 --> 12:25.210
I must confess:

12:25.212 --> 12:28.246
One of your doctors...

12:28.248 --> 12:31.049
Shared your x-ray reports
with me.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.518
It says you have

12:33.520 --> 12:35.186
Two hearts.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.856
But... Only one

12:37.858 --> 12:40.391
Reproductive system.
(quiet chuckle)

12:40.393 --> 12:43.094
Complicated, no?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.362
Ah, tell me.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.698
Has anyone tasted

12:46.700 --> 12:48.733
Your cherry pie?

12:48.735 --> 12:51.269
<i>Oh, dear god--</i>
<i>she's a psycho pervert!</i>

12:51.271 --> 12:52.871
<i>She's down to earth is all.</i>

12:52.873 --> 12:54.739
So, you're virgins?

12:54.741 --> 12:56.741
Sad for you.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.743
But do you at least

12:58.745 --> 13:01.112
Pleasure yourselves?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.714
She never wants that.

13:02.716 --> 13:03.882
I hate you.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.551
If I touch myself,

13:06.553 --> 13:09.621
She closes her eyes and pretends
she doesn't feel anything.

13:09.623 --> 13:13.091
She told me
she leaves her body.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.293
I think she's lying.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.895
I think she likes it.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.130
Oh, shut your
disgusting mouth, you slut!

13:21.233 --> 13:22.901
And you...

13:22.903 --> 13:25.203
Get out of this room.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.139
Yeah.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.941
You rest now.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.910
But I'll be back.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.746
I never give up on a friend.

13:34.748 --> 13:37.816
<i>Meine liebchen.</i>

13:50.629 --> 13:52.931
(door closes)

13:52.933 --> 13:55.567
(kissing, passionate moaning)

13:56.101 --> 13:57.836
(laughs)

14:05.110 --> 14:07.011
(moans, laughs)

14:15.788 --> 14:18.022
No, no, no. Don't stop.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.124
Come on, I want to do it.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.292
We can't afford a baby.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.127
Well, I stole two rubbers

14:23.129 --> 14:24.462
From drucker's because

14:24.464 --> 14:27.065
I just can't get enough of you.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.301
I have something
for you, too.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.037
It's in my car.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.139
Stay here.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.442
(laughs)

14:57.196 --> 14:59.697
Okay.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.066
(gasps)

15:08.007 --> 15:10.508
Um...

15:10.510 --> 15:13.077
Who are you?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.992
(gasps)
oh, oh.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.530
Oh, for me.

15:32.532 --> 15:33.898
Oh, okay.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.101
Thank you.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.337
(laughs anxiously)

15:55.721 --> 15:59.023
What-what happened
to the rest of your mask?

16:01.226 --> 16:03.127
Who the hell is this?
Wait, y-you didn't hire him?

16:05.931 --> 16:07.799
Troy...?

16:10.402 --> 16:11.803
Troy?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.172
Bonnie:
No!

16:16.475 --> 16:18.643
(panting)

16:21.080 --> 16:23.247
(slicing)

16:23.249 --> 16:25.316
(wheezing, maniacal laughter)

16:34.326 --> 16:35.059
No!

16:41.433 --> 16:44.002
No! (panting)

16:47.106 --> 16:48.106
(raspy panting)

16:48.108 --> 16:49.407
No!

16:56.315 --> 16:58.950
¶ look good
in your short shorts ¶

16:58.952 --> 17:00.151
¶ <i>down at the beach</i> ¶

17:00.153 --> 17:01.452
¶ I really go for your tan

17:01.454 --> 17:02.987
¶ <i>down at the beach</i> ¶

17:02.989 --> 17:04.989
¶ well, now,
let's get down and dirty... ¶

17:04.991 --> 17:06.290
¶ <i>down at the beach...</i> ¶

17:06.292 --> 17:08.960
Clipping coupons?

17:08.962 --> 17:12.463
(chuckles) it's a review
for <i>stage fright.</i>

17:12.465 --> 17:14.866
Dietrich's new film.

17:14.868 --> 17:18.970
Clearly mr. Hitchcock
had some kind of mental break

17:18.972 --> 17:22.006
When he cast her
in this picture.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.008
Look, look at all of them.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.209
Here.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.978
This one is from
<i>the garden of allah,</i>

17:26.980 --> 17:28.980
Calling her box office poison.

17:28.982 --> 17:33.151
They paid her $200,000

17:33.153 --> 17:36.154
To take a hot shit
on that movie.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.756
I-I don't get
to the movies much.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.493
(tapping cup)
refill.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.395
Refill!

17:44.397 --> 17:47.031
(giggling)

17:47.033 --> 17:50.401
(muttering in german)

17:50.403 --> 17:52.837
Jimmy:
I'm serious.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.406
(giggling continues)

17:55.408 --> 17:57.075
I'm serious.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.509
I'm serious,
I'm not kidding, okay?

17:58.511 --> 18:00.344
I can ride a motor bike like the
wind.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.413
Yes...

18:06.418 --> 18:08.019
What are you doing
after work?

18:08.021 --> 18:11.089
I can take you,

18:11.091 --> 18:12.423
If you're lucky.
Okay.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.025
Yeah.
Done deal.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.860
We'll go around the block
a couple times.

18:15.862 --> 18:16.928
A couple times?
Yeah.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.196
That'd be fun.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.897
Maybe you come
check out my place.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.532
Why don't you
just take me home?

18:21.534 --> 18:22.900
Home? Yeah, that's great.
Mm-hmm.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.102
Fancy meeting you here.

18:25.704 --> 18:29.373
I can't seem to get
this thing to work.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.842
Would you try?

18:32.911 --> 18:35.146
Is this your mom?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.183
(chuckles)
hit the road, toots.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.754
You selfish good-for-nothing!

18:43.756 --> 18:45.223
I find us

18:45.225 --> 18:48.259
This place that can be a home,

18:48.261 --> 18:50.128
Where we can expand our show,

18:50.130 --> 18:53.764
Build an audience,

18:53.766 --> 18:55.399
Become a destination,

18:55.401 --> 18:57.735
And you would risk it all
for some floozy?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.137
I heard what the landlord said.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.805
They don't want us here anymore.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.807
You're living
in your own dream, elsa.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.746
Now, be careful with these,
ma petite.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.248
I only have two pair left.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.983
Okay, miss elsa.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.985
They're so pretty.
They are so pretty,

19:13.987 --> 19:16.420
Just like you.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.256
Now, fold for mama.

19:18.258 --> 19:21.092
Where were we,
herr haddonfield?

19:21.094 --> 19:23.928
No offense, miss elsa, but I
lost four toes to frostbite

19:23.930 --> 19:26.130
In the ardennes
in the winter of '44.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.599
It's mr. Haddonfield,
not "herr."

19:28.601 --> 19:30.101
You americans are so sensitive.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.169
You won the war.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.937
I'm going to need you
and your troupe

19:32.939 --> 19:35.806
To vacate the field.
But you gave us a year's lease!

19:35.808 --> 19:37.441
We've barely been here
two months!

19:37.443 --> 19:39.343
No one's been coming
to your shows, miss elsa.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.112
Yes, but I'm scouting new acts.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.280
There's a change in the air.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.649
I admire your spirit,
miss elsa, I do,

19:44.651 --> 19:47.985
But there's a revival coming
down from georgia next week...

19:47.987 --> 19:51.022
Preacher wants to plant
his tent right here.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.457
And he pays in advance.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.459
In cash.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.361
Hmph.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.031
If it were up to me, I'd...

20:00.033 --> 20:01.966
(sighs)

20:01.968 --> 20:04.869
My wife doesn't like having
the freaks staying in the field.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.637
She's having nightmares.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.773
My monsters wouldn't hurt a fly!

20:13.979 --> 20:15.146
So pretty, huh?

20:15.148 --> 20:17.014
Made in belgium.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.017
Just for me.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.852
(inhales, sighs)

20:21.854 --> 20:24.021
You know,

20:24.023 --> 20:26.891
Mr. Haddonfield...

20:26.893 --> 20:28.659
You were our savior.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.161
(chuckles)

20:30.163 --> 20:32.196
I think I have
a bottle of schnapps.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.365
Perhaps you would like
to come in and see

20:34.367 --> 20:37.034
The inside of a star's palace?

20:37.036 --> 20:38.302
Hmm?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.073
Jimmy:
<i>I still can't figure out</i>

20:42.075 --> 20:43.574
How you got another month
out of him.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.643
Mind your business.

20:47.679 --> 20:51.549
What, do you think
all your charm

20:51.551 --> 20:54.385
Is going to make that girl blind

20:54.387 --> 20:56.087
To your deformities?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.221
Huh?

20:57.223 --> 21:00.691
What happens when
she sees you?

21:00.693 --> 21:02.560
All of you?

21:02.562 --> 21:06.097
(chuckles)

21:06.099 --> 21:07.865
You know where
you're going to end up.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.067
Where they send
indigent freaks--

21:10.069 --> 21:12.236
The state mad house.

21:12.238 --> 21:15.072
And what about your mother?

21:15.074 --> 21:16.874
Huh?

21:16.876 --> 21:20.544
You want her to die drooling
in some hideous asylum?

21:20.546 --> 21:22.880
We both know that's probably
where she's headed anyway...

21:22.882 --> 21:24.448
Where we're all headed.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.917
It's over, elsa!

21:26.919 --> 21:30.154
You're wrong!

21:32.557 --> 21:33.724
Things are going to change.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.992
I have a plan.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.577
Waitress: You mind closing
out your check now?

21:53.579 --> 21:55.379
I'm going on break.

21:56.581 --> 21:59.784
Oh, darling,

21:59.786 --> 22:01.118
It's on the house.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.322
Stars never pay.

22:19.638 --> 22:23.007
(women laughing)

22:23.942 --> 22:26.444
Woman:
It was once a day.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.012
Now it's only once a week.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.780
Joanne:
Once a week?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.315
I'm lucky if it happens
once a year.

22:31.317 --> 22:34.118
It's a wonder eddie jr.
Was conceived at all.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.954
Every Thursday night
at 9:00 p.M.,

22:36.956 --> 22:39.123
He turns on <i>dragnet</i> and
climbs on top of me.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.159
He hasn't been the same
since korea.

22:42.161 --> 22:45.162
(woman laughs)

22:45.164 --> 22:49.533
¶ just like a torch, you set
the soul within me burning ¶

22:49.535 --> 22:52.203
¶ I must go on

22:52.205 --> 22:54.972
¶ I'm on this road
of no returning ¶

22:54.974 --> 22:59.143
¶ and though it burns me
and it turns me into ashes ¶

22:59.145 --> 23:01.145
¶ my whole world crashes
it's your turn, myrna.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.047
¶ without your kiss of fire...

23:03.049 --> 23:05.983
Where did you... Find it?

23:05.985 --> 23:07.985
I took in that new
roadside attraction.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.820
Wandered into an empty tent,

23:09.822 --> 23:11.555
And the real show began.

23:11.557 --> 23:12.890
(chuckles)

23:12.892 --> 23:14.725
Oh, don't be afraid.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.328
Oh, you'll be so
relaxed after.

23:17.330 --> 23:21.866
¶ if I'm a slave,
then it's a slave I want to be ¶

23:21.868 --> 23:24.402
¶ don't pity me
gather round, ladies!

23:24.404 --> 23:27.037
¶ don't pity me...
Now, I'm not much
of a public speaker,

23:27.039 --> 23:28.906
But this new product
is a lifesaver

23:28.908 --> 23:30.875
For the american housewife.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.344
If you're very quiet,
you can hear a burp.

23:33.346 --> 23:35.346
(plastic lid pops)
(chuckles)
you hear that?

23:35.348 --> 23:38.015
That is the patented
seal of freshness.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.050
And it comes in all these
wonderful colors.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.519
These lovely pastels

23:41.521 --> 23:42.920
Like I know y'all
love to wear.

23:42.922 --> 23:46.090
¶ your kiss of fire...

23:46.092 --> 23:48.159
(woman continues indistinctly)

23:57.369 --> 24:00.037
Don't worry... I don't bite.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.039
¶ if I'm a slave, then it's
a slave I want to be ¶

24:02.041 --> 24:04.708
Come here, baby.

24:04.710 --> 24:07.411
¶ give me your lips

24:07.413 --> 24:10.448
¶ the lips you only
let me borrow ¶

24:10.450 --> 24:14.919
¶ love me tonight and let
the devil take tomorrow ¶

24:14.921 --> 24:17.288
¶ I know that I must have
your kiss ¶

24:17.290 --> 24:19.089
¶ although it dooms me

24:19.091 --> 24:21.058
¶ love, it consumes me

24:21.060 --> 24:22.326
(sighs)

24:24.296 --> 24:25.396
(breathlessly):
Oh, yes...

24:25.398 --> 24:27.064
¶ your kiss

24:27.066 --> 24:28.265
Oh, yes!

24:28.267 --> 24:29.733
¶ of fire.

24:29.735 --> 24:31.068
(moaning, gasping)

24:31.070 --> 24:32.970
Oh, yes.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.974
Oh... Oh, yes!

24:36.976 --> 24:39.777
Bette:
What do you suppose the police

24:39.779 --> 24:41.412
Will ask us when they come?

24:41.414 --> 24:43.414
They'll want to hear
about everything what happened.

24:43.416 --> 24:45.749
You know, we didn't
really see much.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.117
Dot:
<i>Let me do the talking.</i>

24:47.119 --> 24:49.186
What did you see?

24:53.825 --> 24:57.161
Tell me
about your terrible tragedy.

25:00.765 --> 25:02.833
It was a robbery gone bad.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.003
I'm sure the man was enraged

25:06.005 --> 25:08.472
When he found we had
nothing to steal.

25:08.474 --> 25:11.208
It was a moonless night.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.111
Bette was asleep,

25:14.113 --> 25:17.047
But something woke me.

25:18.116 --> 25:19.950
I heard footsteps.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.619
(gasps)

25:21.621 --> 25:24.188
(stabbing, slicing)

25:24.190 --> 25:27.024
So you saw just that one man?

25:28.960 --> 25:30.628
He had on a fedora.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.463
A black fedora,

25:32.465 --> 25:34.131
And he reeked of aqua velva.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.699
Dot:
<i>Stop talking.</i>

25:37.035 --> 25:39.003
It was terrible.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.138
First he strangled mama

25:41.140 --> 25:43.974
With her own necklace
while she was doing needlepoint.

25:43.976 --> 25:44.975
Dot:
<i>Shut up, bette!</i>

25:44.977 --> 25:46.544
Very interesting.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.279
That would make
a terrifying movie.

25:50.148 --> 25:52.349
If it hadn't already been done.

25:52.351 --> 25:53.551
What are you talking about?

25:53.553 --> 25:54.852
The original <i>gaslight.</i>

25:54.854 --> 25:57.054
"strangled by her own necklace

25:57.056 --> 25:59.557
While she was doing
needlepoint."

25:59.559 --> 26:01.692
Bette, if you are
going to talk,

26:01.694 --> 26:03.694
Make sure what
comes out of your mouth

26:03.696 --> 26:05.829
Is more than just
a regurgitated plot.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.197
Bette:
<i>She knows.</i>

26:07.199 --> 26:09.500
And, dot,

26:09.502 --> 26:13.003
Even I am aware
that your mother died

26:13.005 --> 26:15.239
Two days before you were found
with fresh wounds.

26:19.678 --> 26:22.046
You two should try
harder to get

26:22.048 --> 26:23.914
Your story straight...

26:23.916 --> 26:26.116
Before the coppers show up.

26:53.712 --> 26:54.878
Radio announcer:
We interrupt this program

26:54.880 --> 26:56.714
To bring you breaking news.

26:56.716 --> 26:59.083
Jupiter police have confirmed
the identity of the two bodies

26:59.085 --> 27:00.384
Found murdered in their home

27:00.386 --> 27:02.286
In the quiet enclave
of bridgewater.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.722
Jeffrey and mildred bachman
had been dead

27:04.724 --> 27:06.223
For at least a week
before neighbors

27:06.225 --> 27:08.359
Made the horrific discovery.

27:10.895 --> 27:12.963
(heavy breathing)

27:13.932 --> 27:16.433
(screaming)

27:16.435 --> 27:18.402
<i>Neighbors described</i>
<i>the brutal scene as,</i>

27:18.404 --> 27:21.639
And I quote, "a blood bath."

27:31.116 --> 27:33.417
Corey bachman,
the couple's eight-year-old son,

27:33.419 --> 27:35.486
Remains missing.

27:36.621 --> 27:39.089
(screaming)

27:39.091 --> 27:41.091
This recent discovery,

27:41.093 --> 27:43.427
The killing of troy miller and
the abduction of bonnie lipton,

27:43.429 --> 27:44.962
Along with the death
of eudora tattler,

27:44.964 --> 27:46.964
Bring to four the number
of shocking murders

27:46.966 --> 27:48.499
That have terrified
the residents

27:48.501 --> 27:51.101
Of our peaceful hamlet
in the past two weeks.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.103
Although police have
not yet confirmed a connection,

27:53.105 --> 27:55.806
The grim fact that
a similar weapon was involved

27:55.808 --> 27:58.142
In all four killings
leads this reporter

27:58.144 --> 28:00.444
To conclude a single maniac
is preying

28:00.446 --> 28:01.945
Upon the citizens
of jupiter township.

28:01.947 --> 28:03.981
One can only hope that,
when justice comes,

28:03.983 --> 28:07.017
It will be swift and final.

28:33.978 --> 28:35.979
(quietly):
Hey.

28:35.981 --> 28:37.481
Hey, come here.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.316
Here.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.019
We should both eat.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.555
There you go,
take that.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.196
Don't worry.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.732
Somebody will find us.

28:56.501 --> 28:59.570
Your parents are never going
to stop looking for you.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.406
I think he killed my parents.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.246
(door creaks open)
(gasps)

29:21.359 --> 29:25.162
(winding gears)

29:26.765 --> 29:28.832
(music box plays gentle melody)

29:41.112 --> 29:42.913
Bonnie:
Oh, clown, you're...

29:42.915 --> 29:45.215
You're so talented.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.952
Please, release us,
so we can tell the world.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.388
Please?

29:51.390 --> 29:53.891
(clown chuckling)

29:53.893 --> 29:55.959
(whimpering)

30:06.971 --> 30:09.039
(jingling)

30:10.475 --> 30:12.476
(jingling loudly)

30:15.280 --> 30:17.848
(whimpering)

30:41.673 --> 30:43.740
(squeaking)

30:47.345 --> 30:49.112
(pops)

30:49.114 --> 30:50.514
(gasping)

30:50.516 --> 30:52.349
(panting)

30:52.351 --> 30:54.017
(whimpering):
No.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.026
(screaming)

31:11.336 --> 31:13.036
(screaming continues)

31:18.977 --> 31:21.612
(screaming, crashing continue)

31:32.056 --> 31:33.156
I like this one.

31:33.158 --> 31:34.391
It's trashy. Drop it.

31:37.161 --> 31:38.028
You're so mean.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.162
We have to go.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.865
Go where, <i>meine liebe?</i>

31:41.867 --> 31:44.067
I went to the hospital.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.670
They said you had disappeared
into the shadows.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.372
I saw men there
asking about you.

31:48.374 --> 31:49.840
Detectives.

31:49.842 --> 31:51.208
We're not afraid
of the police.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.010
No?

31:53.012 --> 31:55.045
Have you seen the papers?

31:55.047 --> 31:56.880
A spree,

31:56.882 --> 31:58.749
They are calling it.

31:58.751 --> 32:02.185
A murderous tear
started by...

32:02.187 --> 32:03.387
You?

32:03.389 --> 32:05.889
But it isn't true.

32:05.891 --> 32:07.257
"old sparky."

32:07.259 --> 32:09.026
That's what they call
the electric chair

32:09.028 --> 32:10.694
At florida
state prison.

32:10.696 --> 32:14.031
Even if only one of you
is found guilty,

32:14.033 --> 32:15.999
The other one will go
with her to the chair.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.102
Unless...

32:19.104 --> 32:21.705
They separate you first.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.040
Leave her alone.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.374
Oh...

32:24.376 --> 32:25.776
Trying to protect your sister?

32:27.745 --> 32:29.546
You couldn't protect
your mother.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.281
Bette: <i>Singin' in</i>
<i>the rain</i> is playing

32:31.283 --> 32:33.951
At the majestic
in west palm.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.386
Please take
us, mother.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.221
We can sneak in
after it starts.

32:38.223 --> 32:39.222
It'll be dark.

32:39.224 --> 32:40.390
No one will see us.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.392
Bette,

32:42.394 --> 32:46.396
I won't have any more
of this foolishness.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.066
What do you think
would become of our lives

32:49.068 --> 32:52.469
If people round here learned
what lived on this farm?

32:52.471 --> 32:54.237
What are our lives now?

32:54.239 --> 32:55.939
It's a prison.

32:55.941 --> 32:59.076
You're too young to remember
what happened in alabama.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.945
Why we had to leave
in the dead of night.

33:01.947 --> 33:04.314
I want to see
the movie.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.083
I want to see it now!

33:06.085 --> 33:07.384
In glorious technicolor.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.654
I said that's enough!

33:10.656 --> 33:11.922
You can't
keep us here.

33:11.924 --> 33:13.123
It's not right.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.157
It's not right!

33:14.159 --> 33:16.126
She didn't know
what she was doing.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.662
No, but you did. You could have
stopped her, and you didn't.

33:18.664 --> 33:19.997
Dot:
<i>Bette, what have you done?</i>

33:19.999 --> 33:22.599
Bette: It's not right!
Dot: Bette!

33:22.601 --> 33:23.600
Stop!
It's not right!

33:23.602 --> 33:25.969
You are both guilty.

33:25.971 --> 33:27.938
Perhaps you even more so, dot.

33:27.940 --> 33:29.606
After all,
wasn't it you

33:29.608 --> 33:32.676
Who then stabbed
your sister?

33:40.952 --> 33:43.120
You were punishing her.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.822
Not for her crime,

33:45.824 --> 33:47.958
But for your own.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.027
What do you want?

33:53.998 --> 33:55.999
To save you.

33:56.001 --> 33:57.968
Oh.

33:57.970 --> 33:59.803
To save you.

33:59.805 --> 34:00.971
Save you.

34:00.973 --> 34:03.040
Of course.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.815
Bette:
<i>Dear diary,</i>

34:11.817 --> 34:14.151
<i>It was the glorious</i>
<i>third of September</i>

34:14.153 --> 34:17.521
<i>When I was finally freed</i>
<i>from the shadows.</i>

34:17.523 --> 34:20.057
<i>The future had</i>
<i>never seemed brighter.</i>

34:29.233 --> 34:32.602
Let's hope they start bringing
in some paying customers, huh?

34:47.085 --> 34:50.287
¶

35:14.045 --> 35:15.712
Bette:
<i>Dear diary,</i>

35:15.714 --> 35:17.747
<i>I have seen my future.</i>

35:17.749 --> 35:19.950
It is pink and wrapped in silk.

35:19.952 --> 35:23.920
<i>I never thought my escape from</i>
<i>darkness could be so complete.</i>

35:23.922 --> 35:26.756
<i>I found myself in the middle</i>
<i>of a movie star's palace.</i>

35:26.758 --> 35:30.060
<i>Elsa's tent is</i>
<i>the epitome of glamour.</i>

35:30.062 --> 35:31.728
<i>There is only one law here--</i>

35:31.730 --> 35:34.731
<i>The bigger the star,</i>
<i>the bigger the tent.</i>

35:34.733 --> 35:37.734
<i>Glorious freedom.</i>

35:37.736 --> 35:40.604
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

35:40.606 --> 35:44.007
<i>I dare to imagine myself</i>
<i>surrounded by beauty.</i>

35:47.111 --> 35:48.945
Dot:
<i>Dear diary,</i>

35:48.947 --> 35:52.149
<i>My soul plumbs</i>
<i>new depths of despair.</i>

35:52.151 --> 35:54.985
<i>I long for the quiet</i>
<i>of the farm.</i>

35:54.987 --> 35:56.753
<i>The warmth of my bed,</i>

35:56.755 --> 36:00.123
<i>The smell of flowers</i>
<i>outside my window.</i>

36:00.125 --> 36:04.127
<i>I'm surrounded</i>
<i>by a cesspool of activity.</i>

36:04.129 --> 36:06.163
<i>No words can do justice</i>

36:06.165 --> 36:09.766
<i>To the depravity</i>
<i>that permeates the grounds.</i>

36:09.768 --> 36:12.502
<i>A creature they call</i>
<i>"meep the geek" chews off</i>

36:12.504 --> 36:15.939
<i>The heads of living things</i>
<i>for sport and amusement,</i>

36:15.941 --> 36:20.143
<i>Darkening further</i>
<i>the edges of my nightmares.</i>

36:20.145 --> 36:21.945
Hey, don't be scared.

36:21.947 --> 36:23.947
Meep just got a little excited.

36:23.949 --> 36:26.950
It's not every day he comes
across two beauties in one body.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.119
Hi. I'm jimmy.

36:29.121 --> 36:31.021
Jimmy darling.

36:31.023 --> 36:34.191
Dot: <i>Though even</i>
<i>in the darkest of night...</i>

36:35.660 --> 36:38.962
...The promise of dawn beckons.

36:38.964 --> 36:42.132
<i>Perhaps worst of all is</i>
<i>a bearded lady named ethel,</i>

36:42.134 --> 36:44.134
<i>Who serves as</i>
<i>elsa's henchwoman,</i>

36:44.136 --> 36:47.971
<i>The sasquatch champion of law</i>
<i>and order in this hellish sty.</i>

36:47.973 --> 36:50.807
<i>You heard me right, diary.</i>

36:50.809 --> 36:53.143
<i>A lady with a beard.</i>

36:53.145 --> 36:54.844
She won't let me eat.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.346
Stop this foolishness, dot.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.882
You need your strength
to perform.

37:00.184 --> 37:02.319
I'm gonna sit here

37:02.321 --> 37:04.487
And watch you eat
that entire bowl.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.022
And you--

37:06.024 --> 37:07.357
If you try
to stop her,

37:07.359 --> 37:09.993
I'm gonna slap your ass silly
into next week,

37:09.995 --> 37:11.294
Swear to god.

37:12.396 --> 37:15.165
You ungrateful little bitch.

37:15.167 --> 37:18.335
After all elsa's done for you.

37:18.337 --> 37:22.172
She rescues the wretched and
unloved and gives them a home.

37:22.174 --> 37:24.241
That's what she did for you.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.243
That's what she did
for me.

37:26.245 --> 37:29.079
She did?

37:29.081 --> 37:31.081
I'd fallen on hard times,

37:31.083 --> 37:32.882
Developed a taste
for rye whiskey.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.951
And I wound up
in the drunk tank.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.822
Ethel:
<i>That's where elsa found me.</i>

37:40.858 --> 37:42.692
<i>She reunited me with my boy.</i>

37:42.694 --> 37:44.728
<i>Best of all, she put me</i>
<i>back on the stage.</i>

37:44.730 --> 37:45.795
<i>Where I belong.</i>

37:47.765 --> 37:49.232
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

37:49.234 --> 37:51.534
<i>You're gonna be big stars.</i>

37:51.536 --> 37:53.870
You're gonna pack that tent,
night after night.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.438
The hell we will.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.274
We're nobody's
trained monkey.

38:01.746 --> 38:03.380
Don't you get it?

38:03.382 --> 38:07.384
This place is as good
as it gets for folks like us.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.452
It's the bitter end.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.221
But we take care of each other.

38:11.223 --> 38:12.956
That's why elsa
brought you here--

38:12.958 --> 38:14.291
Be our headline act.

38:15.626 --> 38:18.762
Good god almighty,
I hope you got talent.

38:18.764 --> 38:22.132
Right now, you're
our only hope we got.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.633
So eat up!

38:30.908 --> 38:32.575
Up two inches
on your side, evie.

38:32.577 --> 38:35.145
Okeydokey, but we're
out in the sticks.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.646
And this sign is rinky-dink.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.315
You think everything's
rinky-dink.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.083
I don't like
this, jimmy.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.152
I don't like
this at all.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.087
Cops already been
snooping around once.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.755
And now you say they're
looking for these two?

38:45.757 --> 38:48.425
Should we really be
putting up a banner?

38:48.427 --> 38:50.827
Whole thing
gives me an itch.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.629
What if we get raided?

38:52.631 --> 38:53.596
Jimmy:
You're not worried?

38:53.598 --> 38:55.298
(scoffs)
why should I be?

38:55.300 --> 38:56.800
I survived the stasi.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.002
I think I can deal
with the simpletons

38:59.004 --> 39:00.603
Of the jupiter
police department.

39:00.605 --> 39:03.340
I'll tell them the twins
have been with us a month.

39:03.342 --> 39:04.941
It was only when
they went back

39:04.943 --> 39:05.975
To check on their
darling mother

39:05.977 --> 39:07.944
That they were
attacked.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.646
You worry about the banner,

39:09.648 --> 39:11.848
I'll take care
of everything else.

39:13.951 --> 39:16.353
I really hope elsa knows
what she's doing.

39:16.355 --> 39:18.788
You got to look
on the sunny side.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.190
(tires squealing)

39:22.860 --> 39:25.528
It's the freaks. It's
the freaks. It's the freaks.

39:27.465 --> 39:28.498
Freaks!

39:28.500 --> 39:29.999
Freaks!

39:30.001 --> 39:31.000
Freaks!

39:31.002 --> 39:32.135
Assholes!
Hey!

39:32.137 --> 39:33.269
Come say it to my face!

39:34.305 --> 39:35.572
Relax.

39:36.974 --> 39:38.308
I tell you, sometimes
I can't take it.

39:38.310 --> 39:40.477
The way they look at us.
The way they treat us.

39:40.479 --> 39:41.511
It ain't right.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.580
That's showbiz.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.862
Would you like
some help with that?

39:58.864 --> 40:01.164
Not on your life.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.833
I'm glad to see you taking time
to enjoy yourself.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.969
You spoil me, my darling.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.879
I got to get the hell out of
here. This place is a snake pit!

40:15.881 --> 40:19.682
I got to get back to my life,
my family, my church, my people!

40:19.684 --> 40:21.050
The opium does that to you.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.685
Leaves you in
a cranky mood

40:22.687 --> 40:24.087
When you smoke
too much.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.089
But I agree.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.892
You should go home now,
before you become addicted.

40:28.894 --> 40:32.028
Ethel, will you fetch
her candy striper uniform?

40:32.030 --> 40:33.863
We even washed
it for you.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.265
(speaks german)

40:35.267 --> 40:38.268
Remember, when you leave here,

40:38.270 --> 40:40.703
You say nothing
about your time with us.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.539
Are you nuts?

40:42.541 --> 40:44.908
I was drugged, ravaged.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.043
Everyone needs to know
what goes on out here--

40:47.045 --> 40:48.545
The real freak show!

40:48.547 --> 40:50.046
Oh, no, my darling.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.382
You are confused.

40:52.384 --> 40:54.417
You liked it here with us.

40:54.419 --> 40:55.718
No.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.421
No.

40:58.423 --> 41:00.490
You loved it.

41:24.748 --> 41:26.816
¶

41:54.111 --> 41:55.612
Do you see anyone

41:55.614 --> 41:57.113
Being ravaged

41:57.115 --> 41:58.481
Or tortured against her will?

41:58.483 --> 41:59.949
Huh?

41:59.951 --> 42:01.985
Looks to me like
a young woman

42:01.987 --> 42:05.188
Who is taking her
own pleasure

42:05.190 --> 42:07.690
For the very first time.

42:24.341 --> 42:26.709
(whimpering)

42:38.389 --> 42:39.956
I liked it.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.064
I liked it.

42:52.703 --> 42:54.971
I can still feel them.

42:56.407 --> 42:57.473
All over me.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.644
Inside me.

43:03.047 --> 43:05.381
(sighs, chuckles)

43:05.383 --> 43:07.016
Elsa:
Now, now.

43:07.018 --> 43:09.218
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.553
I'm gonna tell.

43:10.555 --> 43:12.522
They're depraved monsters!

43:12.524 --> 43:15.858
I'll tell you who
the monsters are!

43:15.860 --> 43:18.528
The people outside this tent!

43:18.530 --> 43:24.534
In your town,
in all these little towns.

43:24.536 --> 43:28.771
Housewives pinched
with bitterness,

43:28.773 --> 43:31.874
Stupefied with boredom
as they doze off

43:31.876 --> 43:34.711
In front of their
laundry detergent commercials,

43:34.713 --> 43:38.381
And dream of strange,
erotic pleasures.

43:38.383 --> 43:41.217
They have no souls.

43:41.219 --> 43:45.588
My monsters, the ones
you call depraved,

43:45.590 --> 43:49.058
They are the beautiful,
heroic ones.

43:49.060 --> 43:51.961
They offer their oddity
to the world.

43:51.963 --> 43:55.098
They provide a laugh,
or a fright,

43:55.100 --> 43:57.900
To people in need
of entertainment.

43:57.902 --> 43:59.969
Everyone is living

43:59.971 --> 44:01.938
The life they chose.

44:01.940 --> 44:04.073
But you...

44:04.075 --> 44:07.410
You undoubtedly...

44:07.412 --> 44:10.980
Will be one of those
soulless monsters.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.151
Perhaps you already are.

44:25.262 --> 44:27.764
Miss elsa, miss elsa!

44:27.766 --> 44:29.932
A chauffeur in a big car came

44:29.934 --> 44:32.301
And bought out
the whole show tonight!

44:32.303 --> 44:34.771
(laughing):
No!

44:34.773 --> 44:37.006
What did your
fraulein elsa tell you?

44:37.008 --> 44:38.975
I knew it would work.

44:38.977 --> 44:41.511
That banner is bringing them in.

44:41.513 --> 44:45.348
Those twins, they are
going to save us.

44:49.319 --> 44:51.020
You see, peppermint girl?

44:51.022 --> 44:52.422
Everything works out.

44:53.791 --> 44:56.826
Looks like my pipe
will stay nice and full

44:56.828 --> 44:58.928
Should you hear a siren's call.

45:11.709 --> 45:14.711
Ethel:
$18, that's all?

45:14.713 --> 45:16.546
(laughs) one of them
finished so fast,

45:16.548 --> 45:18.014
I felt bad charging
at normal price.

45:18.016 --> 45:21.150
Well, nice doesn't
pay the bills.

45:21.152 --> 45:22.919
Nobody saw you leave, did they?

45:24.855 --> 45:26.189
Nope.

45:26.191 --> 45:28.858
Left through the back door.

45:28.860 --> 45:33.529
Mama, I'm tired of leaving
through back doors,

45:33.531 --> 45:35.732
Like a common criminal.

45:35.734 --> 45:36.899
We deserve a better life.

45:36.901 --> 45:38.067
We all do.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.001
We could leave this place.

45:39.003 --> 45:40.203
Absolutely not.

45:40.205 --> 45:42.038
Elsa's doing the best she can.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.673
Times are tough.

45:43.675 --> 45:45.875
Thanks to red skelton
and lucille ball,

45:45.877 --> 45:47.910
Folks are getting
their jollies at home now.

45:49.046 --> 45:50.513
We got to stick together.

45:50.515 --> 45:51.848
These are our people.

45:51.850 --> 45:53.015
Our people are
a bunch of drunks.

45:53.017 --> 45:54.383
Carnies drown their sorrows

45:54.385 --> 45:56.018
In a little hooch-- so what?

45:56.020 --> 45:58.087
So what?! They have programs
for people like that now.

45:58.089 --> 45:59.222
Support groups.

45:59.224 --> 46:01.057
I can get them help.
A clean start.

46:01.059 --> 46:02.391
We can get out of this dump.

46:02.393 --> 46:03.960
You watch your mouth.
I've had it!

46:04.928 --> 46:06.529
I want out!

46:06.531 --> 46:10.099
There's got to be a place
somewhere, anywhere!

46:10.101 --> 46:11.934
We could buy a tract
of land on the cheap.

46:11.936 --> 46:14.537
We could plant crops,
live off the land.

46:14.539 --> 46:18.207
What, so now you're moses
leading the israelites?

46:18.209 --> 46:20.042
Well, why not?
I want a normal life.

46:20.044 --> 46:22.912
There is no normal
for us, jimmy.

46:22.914 --> 46:25.381
You want to be a hero,
you go talk to those twins.

46:25.383 --> 46:26.415
Make 'em eat.

46:26.417 --> 46:28.484
Make 'em like it here.

46:31.722 --> 46:33.156
But no flipper action.

46:48.939 --> 46:50.740
Bette:
No.

46:50.742 --> 46:52.575
No, get away.

46:52.577 --> 46:54.143
Get away, get away!

46:54.145 --> 46:56.579
No, get away,
get away, get away!

46:56.581 --> 46:58.047
Jimmy:
What's going on here?

46:59.416 --> 47:01.584
I gotta thank you.

47:01.586 --> 47:03.586
That sign
you freaks put up

47:03.588 --> 47:06.155
Helped me find
my two main suspects.

47:08.425 --> 47:09.792
Bette and dot tattler,

47:09.794 --> 47:11.327
You're under arrest for murder.

47:11.329 --> 47:12.595
That hurts.
It's too tight.

47:12.597 --> 47:13.963
Now, just hold on
a second, detective.

47:13.965 --> 47:14.964
Bette and dot are victims, too.

47:14.966 --> 47:16.098
They were stabbed themselves.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.733
Is that why they ran
from the hospital?

47:19.603 --> 47:22.805
Their mother died days
before they were attacked,

47:22.807 --> 47:25.274
And there was no sign of any
forced entry at the house.

47:25.276 --> 47:27.476
Way I see it,
they murdered their mother,

47:27.478 --> 47:29.111
And then they tried
to cover it up.

47:29.113 --> 47:31.280
Wouldn't surprise me
if they were involved

47:31.282 --> 47:33.850
With the killing at the lake
and the bachman murder.

47:33.852 --> 47:36.152
Lies.
You're telling lies.

47:36.154 --> 47:39.155
So that's it?
Case closed?
Look at 'em.
They're monsters.

47:39.157 --> 47:40.957
Jury's gonna have
no problem seeing that.

47:40.959 --> 47:41.991
Don't call them monsters.

47:41.993 --> 47:43.626
I call a spade a spade.

47:43.628 --> 47:45.261
Now, you should
get out of my way.

47:47.297 --> 47:48.698
(whistles)

48:01.044 --> 48:02.979
I can't let you take them.

48:02.981 --> 48:05.047
And who's
gonna stop me?

48:05.049 --> 48:07.550
You and your miscreants?
(gun cocks)

48:09.486 --> 48:11.487
Come tomorrow morning,
my boys are gonna come over here

48:11.489 --> 48:12.989
And run you
out of town.

48:12.991 --> 48:15.691
There is no place
in jupiter for freaks.

48:15.693 --> 48:17.994
Don't call us freaks!

48:17.996 --> 48:19.061
I'll call you whatever the hell

48:19.063 --> 48:20.363
I want to,
you freak...

48:20.365 --> 48:21.964
(gasps)
(gasps)
(choking)

48:32.342 --> 48:34.410
¶

48:54.898 --> 48:56.599
You saved us.

48:58.201 --> 49:01.137
And you're gonna save us.

49:16.286 --> 49:18.120
(insects trilling)

49:35.939 --> 49:37.907
Do you like
your seat, dandy?

49:37.909 --> 49:40.109
They're all
my seats.

49:40.111 --> 49:41.610
I could sit
anywhere I like.

49:41.612 --> 49:42.945
Yes, you can.

49:42.947 --> 49:45.581
I like the one
you're in.

49:45.583 --> 49:46.949
Oh.

49:46.951 --> 49:48.317
(laughs)

49:52.823 --> 49:53.823
How's that?

49:53.825 --> 49:55.124
Better.

49:55.126 --> 49:56.425
The seat's warm.

49:56.427 --> 49:58.828
Mother made it
toasty for you.

49:58.830 --> 50:00.930
Can you see
okay, darling?

50:00.932 --> 50:02.031
There's nothing to see.

50:03.133 --> 50:05.434
Where are the freaks?

50:05.436 --> 50:06.769
(sighs)

50:06.771 --> 50:08.104
I'm getting bored.

50:08.106 --> 50:10.940
I don't like this,
mother.

50:10.942 --> 50:12.942
Remember what
dr. Peterson said.

50:12.944 --> 50:14.944
If you allow yourself
to become agitated,

50:14.946 --> 50:16.612
That nasty rash
will come back.

50:16.614 --> 50:17.847
You don't want
that, do you?

50:17.849 --> 50:20.116
Man:
Places, everyone!

50:20.118 --> 50:21.951
Pepper, salty, move your asses!

50:21.953 --> 50:23.052
Come on!

50:29.126 --> 50:32.128
(circus music playing)

50:32.130 --> 50:33.696
Freaks.

50:39.169 --> 50:41.737
On in five, darling.

50:47.144 --> 50:49.712
(music continues,
drumroll begins)

50:52.315 --> 50:53.649
(cymbal crashes)

50:53.651 --> 50:55.718
Ethel:
Ladies and gentlemen.

50:55.720 --> 50:58.821
Everything you've heard is true.

50:58.823 --> 51:01.657
All that has been
advertised is here,

51:01.659 --> 51:04.026
Under this tent.

51:04.028 --> 51:06.162
Wonders.

51:06.164 --> 51:07.730
Curiosities.

51:07.732 --> 51:09.732
A plethora of

51:09.734 --> 51:12.034
The strange, the weird,

51:12.036 --> 51:15.071
The bizarre, the unusual!

51:16.540 --> 51:18.507
From jungles untamed

51:18.509 --> 51:22.178
To forests enchanted.

51:22.180 --> 51:24.180
From the dark continent

51:24.182 --> 51:26.482
To the spice-laden lands
of india.

51:29.686 --> 51:32.054
Astounding mistakes of nature

51:32.056 --> 51:33.522
Are gathered here

51:33.524 --> 51:36.092
For your amusement
and edification.

51:36.094 --> 51:38.694
What you're about to see

51:38.696 --> 51:41.263
Will astound your very senses

51:41.265 --> 51:43.265
And harrow...

51:43.267 --> 51:46.102
Yes, harrow your souls.

51:46.104 --> 51:49.605
And tonight,
for the first time anywhere,

51:49.607 --> 51:53.309
The spectacular siamese sisters.

51:58.215 --> 52:01.117
But amidst the terrifying
and the tragic...

52:01.119 --> 52:04.220
A voice... And beauty.

52:04.222 --> 52:06.222
Ladies and gentlemen,

52:06.224 --> 52:10.259
Direct from the cabarets
of prewar berlin,

52:10.261 --> 52:12.228
The enchantress who holds sway

52:12.230 --> 52:14.730
Over all of nature's mistakes:

52:14.732 --> 52:17.133
Elsa mars.

52:22.472 --> 52:24.573
¶

52:24.575 --> 52:28.577
¶ it's a god-awful
small affair ¶

52:28.579 --> 52:32.314
¶ to the girl
with the mousy hair ¶

52:32.316 --> 52:36.986
¶ but her mommy
is yelling "no" ¶

52:36.988 --> 52:40.823
¶ and her daddy
has told her to go ¶

52:40.825 --> 52:44.293
¶ but her friend
is nowhere to be seen ¶

52:44.295 --> 52:48.497
¶ now she walks
through her sunken dream ¶

52:48.499 --> 52:52.601
¶ to the seats with
the clearest view ¶

52:52.603 --> 52:55.204
¶ and she's hooked
to the silver screen ¶

52:56.973 --> 53:00.342
¶ but the film is
a saddening bore ¶

53:00.344 --> 53:03.946
¶ for she's lived it
ten times or more ¶

53:03.948 --> 53:08.117
¶ she could spit in
the eyes of fools ¶

53:08.119 --> 53:10.953
¶ as they ask her to focus on

53:10.955 --> 53:15.124
¶ sailors fighting
in the dance hall ¶

53:15.126 --> 53:16.825
¶ oh, man

53:16.827 --> 53:21.130
¶ look at those cavemen go

53:21.132 --> 53:23.766
¶ it's the freakiest show

53:25.135 --> 53:32.374
¶ is there life on mars?

53:33.376 --> 53:35.744
¶

53:43.687 --> 53:47.356
¶ but the film is
a saddening bore ¶

53:47.358 --> 53:50.125
¶ 'cause I wrote it
ten times or more ¶

53:51.494 --> 53:55.164
¶ it's about to be writ again

53:55.166 --> 53:58.067
¶ as I ask you to focus on

53:58.069 --> 54:02.037
¶ sailors fighting
in the dance hall ¶

54:02.039 --> 54:04.173
¶ oh, man

54:04.175 --> 54:06.642
¶ look at those cavemen go

54:07.911 --> 54:10.946
¶ it's the freakiest show

54:12.182 --> 54:15.584
¶ take a look at the lawman

54:15.586 --> 54:17.886
¶ beating up the wrong guy

54:17.888 --> 54:19.255
¶ oh, man

54:19.257 --> 54:23.425
¶ wonder if he'll ever know

54:23.427 --> 54:27.696
¶ he's in
the best-selling show ¶

54:27.698 --> 54:35.037
¶ is there life on mars?

54:35.039 --> 54:37.306
¶

55:06.770 --> 55:09.071
(music fades)

55:09.073 --> 55:11.640
(breathing hard)

55:14.978 --> 55:16.078
Dot:
You're not supposed
to be back here.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.413
Care for a cigarette?

55:17.415 --> 55:18.847
I'd love one,
thanks.

55:20.950 --> 55:22.851
So...

55:26.156 --> 55:27.956
...How much?

55:27.958 --> 55:29.425
Elsa:
My monsters aren't prostitutes.

55:29.427 --> 55:31.093
You misunderstand.

55:31.095 --> 55:32.428
We don't want to buy anyone
for the night.

55:32.430 --> 55:34.096
We want to buy them.
Period.

55:34.098 --> 55:35.431
$5,000.

55:35.433 --> 55:36.932
For one, maybe.

55:36.934 --> 55:38.300
But there are
two beauties here.

55:38.302 --> 55:39.435
Okay, $10,000.

55:39.437 --> 55:40.769
Have you any idea

55:40.771 --> 55:42.004
What kind of box office

55:42.006 --> 55:44.106
They'll bring in
over the next year?

55:44.108 --> 55:46.275
They're my headliners.

55:46.277 --> 55:48.444
Let's ask them.

55:48.446 --> 55:49.945
Do you think $10,000

55:49.947 --> 55:51.814
Is a fair
price for you?

55:51.816 --> 55:53.949
$15,000, and not
one penny more.

55:53.951 --> 55:55.984
Unless she grows
another head.

55:55.986 --> 55:57.019
(chuckles)

55:57.021 --> 55:58.287
We're staying
right here.

55:58.289 --> 55:59.521
This is our home.

56:00.990 --> 56:02.991
(laughing quietly):
Darlings.

56:02.993 --> 56:05.327
That's just what
I wanted to hear.

56:05.329 --> 56:07.162
I knew it.

56:07.164 --> 56:09.631
One night in the spotlight,
and you've got the bug.

56:09.633 --> 56:11.133
You're one of us.

56:11.135 --> 56:15.637
You see, we are a
troupe of entertainers.

56:15.639 --> 56:17.639
A family.

56:17.641 --> 56:20.709
And you will not split up
our family.

56:23.313 --> 56:24.646
Come, dandy.

56:24.648 --> 56:26.382
I need a long, hot bath.

56:26.384 --> 56:28.517
Though nothing will wash away
the ghastly memory

56:28.519 --> 56:30.986
Of that infernal caterwauling.

56:30.988 --> 56:32.988
By far the most freakish thing
of all tonight

56:32.990 --> 56:34.757
Was your pathetic
attempt at singing.

56:36.159 --> 56:37.259
(laughs)

56:46.503 --> 56:49.071
(insects trilling)

56:56.012 --> 56:58.313
(creaking)

57:24.541 --> 57:27.109
¶

57:38.922 --> 57:41.089
Friends...

57:41.091 --> 57:42.925
This lawman was supposed

57:42.927 --> 57:45.594
To protect and serve
the innocent.

57:45.596 --> 57:49.264
But instead, he judged us guilty

57:49.266 --> 57:51.533
Before he even set foot
into our camp.

57:52.802 --> 57:55.571
All we've ever wanted

57:55.573 --> 57:57.473
Was a place where
we could feel safe

57:57.475 --> 58:00.909
And be just the way we are.

58:00.911 --> 58:04.146
But no one is going
to hand it to us.

58:04.148 --> 58:06.982
We're going to have
to rise up

58:06.984 --> 58:09.351
And take it.

58:11.287 --> 58:14.089
Don't we deserve to be happy?
Others: Yeah!

58:14.091 --> 58:16.091
When bad things keep
happening to good people,

58:16.093 --> 58:19.962
You start to question
what is right and what is wrong.

58:19.964 --> 58:23.765
Well, I say it's time we make
our own right and wrong.

58:23.767 --> 58:27.002
I say it's wrong
for them to treat us like shit

58:27.004 --> 58:29.972
And kick us around like
the scum of the earth!

58:29.974 --> 58:32.107
They want to call us monsters?

58:32.109 --> 58:33.942
Fine, we'll act like monsters.

58:33.944 --> 58:36.111
From this day on,

58:36.113 --> 58:37.813
If anyone tries
to mess with us--

58:37.815 --> 58:41.650
Any of us, 'cause you're
one of us now--

58:41.652 --> 58:44.887
They're going to end up
like this pig.

58:49.125 --> 58:51.193
Let's show 'em what we can do.

58:52.662 --> 58:54.530
To the worms!

59:18.221 --> 59:20.322
You missed dinner, hon.

59:20.324 --> 59:22.558
The gang's
over the moon.

59:22.560 --> 59:23.892
Sold-out show

59:23.894 --> 59:25.727
And all tonight.

59:25.729 --> 59:27.729
It's all thanks
to you.

59:27.731 --> 59:28.997
You brought
those twins here,

59:28.999 --> 59:30.699
Hung that banner...

59:30.701 --> 59:32.234
Bang!
We're in the black.

59:32.236 --> 59:34.736
I know.

59:36.039 --> 59:39.141
But I have
a confession to make.

59:46.716 --> 59:49.685
Those girls...

59:49.687 --> 59:53.088
I didn't bring them here for us.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.756
To save us.

59:57.026 --> 59:59.595
I brought them here for myself.

1:00:01.698 --> 1:00:03.899
So people would come

1:00:03.901 --> 1:00:08.370
And they would see me

1:00:08.372 --> 1:00:12.074
And I would finally
become a star.

1:00:12.076 --> 1:00:13.942
It's what I've always wanted,
nothing else.

1:00:18.548 --> 1:00:21.149
Is it too late for me?

1:00:23.052 --> 1:00:25.120
Is it wrong?

1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:31.960
Not at all.

1:00:36.899 --> 1:00:39.735
You listen here.

1:00:39.737 --> 1:00:43.305
You've got a gift.

1:00:43.307 --> 1:00:45.741
You deserve the laurels
and the applause

1:00:45.743 --> 1:00:48.910
And the shouts
of "encore."

1:00:48.912 --> 1:00:51.013
Do you really think so?

1:00:53.082 --> 1:00:55.951
I'd bet my hand

1:00:55.953 --> 1:00:58.153
You're gonna become
a household name.

1:00:58.155 --> 1:01:00.188
I know it.

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:02.491
Oh, ethel, my darling...

1:01:02.493 --> 1:01:06.795
Oh... Oh...

1:01:06.797 --> 1:01:09.164
You are too good for me.

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:12.300
Go now.

1:01:12.302 --> 1:01:15.170
Get some rest.

1:01:26.015 --> 1:01:28.383
(creaking softly)

1:01:38.161 --> 1:01:40.729
¶

1:01:45.001 --> 1:01:48.537
¶ auf wiedersehen

1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:54.710
¶ auf wiedersehen

1:01:54.712 --> 1:01:58.980
¶ we'll meet again

1:01:58.982 --> 1:02:02.017
¶ sweetheart

1:02:02.019 --> 1:02:06.388
¶ this lovely day

1:02:07.824 --> 1:02:12.160
¶ has flown my way

1:02:12.162 --> 1:02:16.865
¶ the time has come

1:02:16.867 --> 1:02:18.567
¶ to part

1:02:21.904 --> 1:02:25.040
¶ we'll kiss again

1:02:25.042 --> 1:02:29.678
¶ like this again

1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:35.517
¶ don't let the teardrops

1:02:35.519 --> 1:02:38.854
¶ start

1:02:38.856 --> 1:02:43.024
¶ with love that's true

1:02:43.026 --> 1:02:47.262
¶ I'll wait for you

1:02:47.264 --> 1:02:49.865
¶ auf wiedersehen

1:02:49.867 --> 1:02:51.900
¶ sweetheart.
