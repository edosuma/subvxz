00:23.800 --> 00:24.883
you will ever see.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.609
I think, it will thrill you.

It may even horrify you.

00:32.159 --> 00:36.403
So, if any of you feel
that you cannot endure it,

00:37.410 --> 00:38.543

Oh, god.

00:58.942 --> 00:59.942
Oh, god.

01:05.004 --> 01:06.172
Jake.

01:08.281 --> 01:09.448
Jake, wake up.

01:11.158 --> 01:14.231
You're not fooling anybody.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.986
Do you hear it, Jake?

01:19.987 --> 01:21.237
I know you can.

01:23.159 --> 01:24.519
Isn't it beautiful?

01:24.520 --> 01:26.101
Fuck, fuck, fuck, oh!

01:28.895 --> 01:30.785
Where do you
think it's coming from?

01:30.786 --> 01:32.119
Across the hall?

01:35.300 --> 01:37.028
The floor above?

01:37.029 --> 01:40.858
No, next door.

01:40.859 --> 01:44.313
That's where it's coming from next door.

01:59.029 --> 02:00.929
Jake, come on.

02:00.930 --> 02:04.593
You know you can't sleep, not now.

02:06.197 --> 02:07.347
Who you tryin' to fool?

02:10.139 --> 02:11.091
Listen.

02:18.287 --> 02:20.454
It's getting louder again.

02:23.937 --> 02:26.080
Listen to it, Jake.

02:26.081 --> 02:27.581
Oh, god.

02:28.861 --> 02:31.507
Listen to it, Jake.

02:36.617 --> 02:39.905
It's like you're right
in there watching them.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.593
You feel how hard your dick is?

02:48.140 --> 02:51.033
Ah, go into the bathroom.

02:52.230 --> 02:53.730
That's where it's the loudest.

03:02.912 --> 03:07.912
That's it.

03:11.981 --> 03:13.898
Doesn't that feel good?

03:26.009 --> 03:27.009
Closer.

03:30.277 --> 03:31.777
Closer, that's it.

03:48.027 --> 03:53.027
Get right up against the wall.

03:57.175 --> 03:58.592
Fuck, that's hot!

03:59.443 --> 04:01.379
It's that couple next door.

04:01.380 --> 04:03.043
I bet her pussy's so fucking wet.

04:05.043 --> 04:07.133
Don't be jealous enjoy it, that's it.

04:08.690 --> 04:09.847
It's beautiful.

04:51.664 --> 04:54.318
Cum with them, that's it.

04:54.319 --> 04:55.319
Oh, fuck.

04:59.617 --> 05:00.617
Oh, god.

05:03.888 --> 05:06.388
Time to start the night, Jake.

05:07.345 --> 05:09.144
Time to start the night.

08:04.410 --> 08:06.127
Jake, how are you?

08:07.250 --> 08:08.250
I'm good.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.133
I can't hear you?

08:11.010 --> 08:12.429
I said I'm good.

08:12.430 --> 08:14.130
Wait, I'm gonna come over there.

08:16.380 --> 08:17.213
Where have you been?

08:17.214 --> 08:20.093
I haven't seen you since you
helped me with my cabinets.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.263
I've just been keeping busy.

08:25.230 --> 08:26.430
Doing what?

08:27.550 --> 08:30.093
Just things.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.523
How's your sister?

08:35.169 --> 08:36.169
She's good.

08:37.539 --> 08:39.749
She's coming back tonight, actually.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.573
That's great, you must be excited.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.232
Yeah, I am.

08:46.910 --> 08:48.613
Are you still in school?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.143
We're on break.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.140
Still?

08:57.590 --> 09:01.139
I hate to do this to
you, I hate to be rude,

09:01.140 --> 09:04.789
but I actually have a lot of
stuff to do, if you don't mind.

09:04.790 --> 09:07.339
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:07.340 --> 09:09.853
Yeah, it's really late, sorry.

09:11.430 --> 09:13.089
You know, I'm sure you
have a really, really

09:13.090 --> 09:14.633
long night ahead of you.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.749
But if you have any time,

09:17.750 --> 09:20.100
why don't you come by my
apartment and fuck me?

09:23.980 --> 09:24.980
I'm sorry.

09:25.740 --> 09:29.229
I know you're getting
ready to fuck your sister.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.443
You know, she's a slut.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.100
Jake.

09:40.210 --> 09:41.210
Jake.

09:42.450 --> 09:43.450
Yeah.

09:45.360 --> 09:50.360
I said why don't you come
by and visit me tomorrow?

09:54.633 --> 09:58.810
I have a leaky pipe that I
could use some help with.

10:00.110 --> 10:02.853
You know, how much I
don't like to call Felix.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah, tomorrow I'll stop by.

10:11.610 --> 10:12.610
Have a good night.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.473
Okay, have a good night.

11:05.920 --> 11:09.599
Jake, we left a
little bit of money for you,

11:09.600 --> 11:11.003
and dad left you a gift.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.879
Love, mom and dad.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.453
Awe, isn't that nice, Jake?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.650
Let's see what your dad got you.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.467
Wow, look at that thing.

11:32.407 --> 11:35.574
What are you gonna do with that, Jake?

11:51.810 --> 11:53.399
Stop messing around.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
Let's get started.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.560
Hi, I'm calling
about the $200 special.

12:00.963 --> 12:02.213
It's tonight only, right?

12:03.760 --> 12:04.853
Yeah, I'm 21.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.429
I live on 14th Street.

12:08.430 --> 12:09.730
It's the Village East End.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.107
Yeah, I live on the fifth floor, room 503.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.790
Alright, see you soon, bye.

13:32.785 --> 13:33.623
Hi.

13:33.624 --> 13:34.456
Hi.

13:34.457 --> 13:35.350
Uh, you can come on in.

13:35.351 --> 13:39.239
Thank you.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.289
You can put, uh...

13:40.290 --> 13:42.321
You can take your boots off
and sit down, if you want.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.529
Thanks.

13:43.530 --> 13:44.430
I'm Veronica.

13:44.431 --> 13:45.829
I'm Jake, hi.

13:45.830 --> 13:48.153
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

14:06.665 --> 14:07.665
So.

14:10.495 --> 14:11.995
Wanna get started.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
I don't bite.

14:20.650 --> 14:23.533
So, what do you want?

14:25.050 --> 14:26.050
I'm not sure.

14:27.870 --> 14:29.320
I wanna do everything to you.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.683
Well, I'm fetish friendly.

14:36.490 --> 14:37.740
Do you have any fetishes?

14:41.820 --> 14:43.920
I want you to put your foot in my mouth.

14:45.170 --> 14:46.170
Okay.

16:19.050 --> 16:20.850
Does that feel good, baby brother?

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
Stop.

16:25.099 --> 16:26.772
What's wrong?

16:26.773 --> 16:28.759
Get on top of me.

16:28.760 --> 16:29.983
Sure.

16:29.984 --> 16:32.092
All right.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.079
You're so good, Jake.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.412
You're the best.

17:04.819 --> 17:05.843
Spank me, Jake.

17:09.999 --> 17:11.330
Spank me harder!

17:13.694 --> 17:14.694
Harder!

17:17.176 --> 17:18.176
Cum on my face.

17:38.130 --> 17:40.430
Sorry, if I got your
bed a little bit messy.

17:48.710 --> 17:49.710
Um, is that for me?

17:51.270 --> 17:53.097
Oh, yeah, that's for you.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.531
Thanks.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.040
Thank you.

18:05.742 --> 18:07.348
Have a good night.

18:07.349 --> 18:09.016
Have a good night.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.499
What's the matter, Jake?

18:22.500 --> 18:24.600
Wondering what games I'm playing with you?

18:26.080 --> 18:29.209
Wondering why you're seeing
your sister during sex?

18:29.210 --> 18:30.313
It's quite simple.

18:31.260 --> 18:32.773
We need something more.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.889
I'm talking about a greater high,

18:35.890 --> 18:38.483
something so fucked up
but it feels so good.

18:42.070 --> 18:43.153
Where are you going?

18:48.730 --> 18:49.883
This won't do.

18:53.030 --> 18:55.163
The usual's not gonna be enough anymore.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.100
You're going to be disappointed.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.500
Can I help you?

19:06.830 --> 19:08.999
Yeah, I was wondering
if I could have a session?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.463
Did you schedule an appointment?

19:11.320 --> 19:12.470
No, but I have money.

19:13.690 --> 19:14.690
How old are you?

19:16.640 --> 19:17.640
22.

19:18.470 --> 19:19.470
Can I see your ID?

19:21.310 --> 19:22.310
Yeah.

19:30.015 --> 19:31.409
All right.

19:31.410 --> 19:32.410
Come on in.

19:42.260 --> 19:43.263
Take your shoes off.

19:52.610 --> 19:53.810
I take my money upfront.

19:57.177 --> 19:59.983
It's the $100 special today only, right?

20:01.180 --> 20:02.180
That's right.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.559
Alright, baby, couple of ground rules

20:11.560 --> 20:13.209
to go over before we get started.

20:13.210 --> 20:15.539
This session is for one hour.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.033
When the hour is over, you must go.

20:19.330 --> 20:23.479
Um, as far as, me I'm open to anything,

20:23.480 --> 20:27.163
golden showers, pegging,
everything is fair game to me.

20:28.650 --> 20:30.409
You can pick your own safe word.

20:30.410 --> 20:33.103
I don't want a safe word.

20:33.104 --> 20:34.319
Baby, I think...

20:34.320 --> 20:35.320
Trust me.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.099
Alright, well, I wasn't expecting you,

20:41.100 --> 20:42.159
so I have to get into custom.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.223
But I'll be right back.

20:45.130 --> 20:46.380
Make yourself at home.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.453
Jake, what are you doing here?

21:38.850 --> 21:40.133
Why waste your money?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.693
This isn't good enough anymore.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.833
She's not Molly, Jake.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.583
Can't you see I'm trying to help you?

22:12.540 --> 22:14.513
Can't you see what I'm trying to do?

22:17.840 --> 22:19.590
I'm talking about something better.

22:23.290 --> 22:25.423
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you, Jake.

22:27.870 --> 22:29.470
You believe me, don't you, Jake?

22:32.530 --> 22:34.739
Alright, have your fun.

22:34.740 --> 22:36.669
But this won't change anything.

22:36.670 --> 22:37.670
You'll see.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.833
I'm not going away, Jake.

22:41.820 --> 22:42.820
I promise you that.

22:54.890 --> 22:56.190
Have you been a bad boy?

22:57.420 --> 22:58.570
Yes, mistress.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.489
Take your shirt off.

23:00.490 --> 23:01.839
Yes, mistress.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.023
Throw it on the floor.

23:05.540 --> 23:06.520
Yes, mistress.

23:06.521 --> 23:07.603
Get on your knees.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.507
Yes, mistress.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.420
So, you've been a bad boy?

23:15.190 --> 23:16.420
Yes, mistress.

23:16.421 --> 23:17.749
And you're a dirty little bitch,

23:17.750 --> 23:19.263
who needs to be punished!

23:20.230 --> 23:21.883
- Yes, mistress!
- Say it!

23:22.760 --> 23:23.929
I'm a dirty little bitch,

23:23.930 --> 23:27.023
who needs to be punished!

23:27.024 --> 23:28.432
Good.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.100
You don't mind this, do you?

23:47.998 --> 23:49.460
You like it, don't you?

23:49.461 --> 23:50.562
Oh, yeah.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.730
Yes, mistress.

24:01.832 --> 24:02.915
Ah, ah, ah.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.963
Fucking pathetic.

24:08.493 --> 24:09.393
Yes, mistress.

24:09.394 --> 24:12.012
Yes, mistress, louder!

24:12.013 --> 24:13.841
Yes, mistress!

24:13.842 --> 24:16.326
Oh, I'm sorry does that hurt?

24:16.327 --> 24:17.160
Does that hurt?

24:17.161 --> 24:18.327
- Oh.
- Oh.

24:20.432 --> 24:22.765
I'm gonna have fun with you.

24:27.708 --> 24:28.778
Yes, mistress.

24:28.779 --> 24:30.352
Yes, mistress, louder!

24:30.353 --> 24:32.769
Yes, mistress!
- I can't fucking hear you,

24:32.770 --> 24:34.819
you pathetic piece of shit.

24:34.820 --> 24:39.820
Yes, mistress!

24:47.661 --> 24:49.979
Are you ready to be punished, slave?

24:49.980 --> 24:52.910
- Oh, yes, mistress!
- I can't fucking hear you!

24:52.911 --> 24:54.244
Yes, mistress!

25:08.580 --> 25:09.939
Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't get you off,

25:09.940 --> 25:13.103
but you just didn't seem that into it.

25:14.227 --> 25:15.644
It's all right.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.890
BDSM isn't for everybody.

25:22.890 --> 25:24.190
It wasn't my first time.

25:31.951 --> 25:32.951
Bye.

25:42.450 --> 25:44.503
See, Jake, what did I tell you?

25:45.430 --> 25:48.083
We need something new, something more,

25:49.300 --> 25:53.409
the ultimate high, your sister Jake.

25:53.410 --> 25:55.919
You're supposed to pick her up, right?

25:55.920 --> 25:57.519
That's perfect.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.999
Come on go see your sister, Jake.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Jake.

26:01.915 --> 26:03.429
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:03.430 --> 26:04.879
Jake?

26:04.880 --> 26:05.880
Yeah.

26:06.908 --> 26:08.749
You don't remember us,

26:08.750 --> 26:11.283
Elizabeth, Chris, Korab from school?

26:13.320 --> 26:14.320
Oh, yeah.

26:15.857 --> 26:16.929
How have you guys been?

26:16.930 --> 26:19.519
Better than you, at
least by the looks of it.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.737
Yeah, what the hell
happened to your eye, man?

26:21.738 --> 26:24.113
Oh, it's a long story.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.294
What are you guys up to though?

26:26.295 --> 26:28.600
We were just
gonna go grab something.

26:28.601 --> 26:29.670
You come with us.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.660
I was about to...

26:31.661 --> 26:33.057
I was about to go somewhere.

26:33.058 --> 26:34.141
Come on.

27:20.450 --> 27:21.440
Neither of you are gonna ask him

27:21.441 --> 27:22.840
why he just blew us all off?

27:23.780 --> 27:25.559
I mean, look, I don't wanna
start any shit in a restaurant,

27:25.560 --> 27:27.343
but we have a right to know.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.650
What do you wanna know?

27:31.980 --> 27:33.699
We wanna know why you just
stopped coming to school?

27:33.700 --> 27:36.059
Why you just dropped out
without telling anyone,

27:36.060 --> 27:39.009
not your professors, not your friends,

27:39.010 --> 27:41.889
not me, who I thought
was your best friend,

27:41.890 --> 27:43.199
not even Monica, bro,

27:43.200 --> 27:44.800
Monica, your fucking girlfriend?

27:45.710 --> 27:47.849
It's one thing to treat us like dog shit,

27:47.850 --> 27:51.113
but your girlfriend, that's fucked up.

27:52.310 --> 27:53.859
And if neither of them
were gonna say anything,

27:53.860 --> 27:55.439
then I had to let you know
how disrespectful that was

27:55.440 --> 27:58.190
to the people that thought
they meant something to you.

27:59.931 --> 28:02.799
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.293
I mean, tell me at least you
had a good reason for all it.

28:08.213 --> 28:10.940
All I can say is I had my reasons.

28:12.490 --> 28:13.985
If that's not good enough,

28:13.986 --> 28:15.489
I don't know what to tell you.

28:15.490 --> 28:17.684
That's all you have to say?

28:17.685 --> 28:20.649
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say.

28:20.650 --> 28:21.923
This fucking guy, man.

28:25.555 --> 28:26.646
I don't know.

28:26.647 --> 28:29.413
I don't know what you guys want me to say.

28:29.414 --> 28:30.664
Are you okay?

28:32.557 --> 28:34.349
I mean, yeah, my eye.

28:34.350 --> 28:36.449
No, it's not just your eye.

28:36.450 --> 28:37.850
Frankly, you look like shit.

28:39.940 --> 28:43.803
What's the real reason you
dropped out of school, drugs?

28:45.566 --> 28:48.260
I just wanted other things.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.059
Hey, Jake.

29:35.060 --> 29:36.860
I remembered this was your favorite.

29:42.010 --> 29:43.459
Why don't you come lick it off me?

29:43.460 --> 29:44.460
Jake.

29:45.900 --> 29:46.732
Yeah.

29:46.733 --> 29:47.733
Korab, was right.

29:48.790 --> 29:50.090
Something happened to you.

30:02.350 --> 30:03.900
Don't worry about them.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.370
Don't worry about your
bitch of an ex, Jake.

30:09.270 --> 30:10.893
Didn't you hear?

30:10.894 --> 30:12.194
She's with some other guy.

30:23.158 --> 30:26.075
You're different, Jake, embrace it.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.210
Jake, don't.

30:39.890 --> 30:41.143
Jake don't remember her.

30:42.093 --> 30:43.213
Think about Molly.

30:45.810 --> 30:46.893
Embrace the high.

30:52.610 --> 30:53.923
Tell me a secret.

30:56.137 --> 30:58.887
I feel like I'm the
luckiest guy in the world.

31:03.674 --> 31:04.674
Awe.

31:06.616 --> 31:09.159
Tell me a lie.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.989
I don't think
you're the cutest boy I know.

31:12.990 --> 31:13.990
Cute.

31:14.770 --> 31:16.169
What's the matter with hot?

31:16.170 --> 31:19.963
Come on cute's cute, and you're cute.

31:23.184 --> 31:26.440
I mean, I guess, I'll take it.

31:29.710 --> 31:31.773
Tell me a lie.

31:31.774 --> 31:34.763
I don't
love you or your family.

31:35.655 --> 31:38.479
You're not even trying.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.203
What can I say, I'm a happy guy.

31:43.820 --> 31:44.853
Tell me a secret.

31:49.020 --> 31:50.713
I wanna have your kids.

31:52.340 --> 31:53.363
Really?

31:54.396 --> 31:55.919
Uh-huh.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.449
How many will we have?

31:57.450 --> 31:59.163
Let's see, um,

32:00.770 --> 32:01.802
a boy.

32:01.803 --> 32:03.189
Definitely.

32:03.190 --> 32:04.190
Shut up.

32:06.780 --> 32:09.349
A boy and two girls.

32:09.350 --> 32:10.393
Three kids?

32:11.743 --> 32:13.923
I mean, I guess, I better
get started on that boy.

32:15.150 --> 32:18.459
It's so the brother can look
after his siblings, you know?

32:18.460 --> 32:21.060
Or in my case the sister
look out for her brother.

32:23.970 --> 32:25.199
That sounds good to me.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.200
I'll be there.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.023
Good, 'cause I wouldn't
want you anywhere else.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.990
I don't know if I can
do this anymore, Jake.

32:45.190 --> 32:46.190
What do you mean?

32:47.877 --> 32:50.149
All you wanna do is watch porn.

32:50.150 --> 32:52.369
I mean, we can't even make
love like a regular couple

32:52.370 --> 32:54.320
because it doesn't get your off enough.

32:55.710 --> 32:57.029
What's wrong with fucking with a porno

32:57.030 --> 32:58.739
on in the background?

32:58.740 --> 33:00.799
I'm just trying to spice things up.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.509
That's my point.

33:02.510 --> 33:04.779
You never used to call it fucking.

33:04.780 --> 33:06.779
It was always making love.

33:06.780 --> 33:08.949
Making love, fucking
what's the difference?

33:08.950 --> 33:11.439
There is a difference, Jake.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.789
You used to like making love to me,

33:13.790 --> 33:15.913
and now all you wanna do is fuck.

34:01.520 --> 34:02.683
Yeah, it's me Jake.

34:04.655 --> 34:05.993
I know it's been a while.

34:07.770 --> 34:08.983
Can I come see you?

34:10.570 --> 34:12.072
I got a lot on my mind.

34:13.449 --> 34:14.563
I think, you can help.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.489
Alright, I'll be over soon.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.407
Sorry about the mess.

34:20.408 --> 34:21.558
It was my two siblings.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.299
I share the room with them

34:24.300 --> 34:25.650
till I get back on my feet.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.938
No, that's fine.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.540
So how the hell you been, man?

34:30.610 --> 34:32.110
I haven't seen you in forever.

34:33.210 --> 34:34.860
I'm actually not doin' so good.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.359
Just about to ask you about your eye.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.714
What happened, you got jumped
on the way here or what?

34:40.715 --> 34:43.248
Oh, yeah, my eye it's nothing.

34:43.250 --> 34:45.000
Don't worry about it.

34:46.101 --> 34:47.451
You not back in the life?

34:50.699 --> 34:53.597
Jake, come on, man.

34:53.598 --> 34:54.598
How long?

34:57.290 --> 34:58.640
Been back in for a while.

35:00.543 --> 35:01.470
I should've known I haven't seen you

35:01.471 --> 35:02.820
at the meetings in a while.

35:04.064 --> 35:06.873
What you want me to sponsor
you back and get you in, what?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.790
No, I was actually hoping you had

35:10.920 --> 35:12.499
had something to sort me out.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.500
Sort you out?

35:14.325 --> 35:15.325
You mean like pills?

35:16.930 --> 35:18.430
Yeah, I need something, man.

35:20.293 --> 35:22.519
Let me see.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.270
Now describe to me what's going on.

35:27.130 --> 35:29.579
Well, it's like I can't
control my thoughts.

35:29.580 --> 35:31.209
It's like my brain is trying
to get me to do crazier

35:31.210 --> 35:33.863
and crazier sexual shit,
shit I would never do.

35:34.820 --> 35:36.999
I can't get off otherwise.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.033
Yeah, it's a sexual high.

35:40.948 --> 35:43.527
The brain is a funny thing, my friend.

35:43.528 --> 35:44.963
Here take this.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.113
What is it?

35:49.114 --> 35:50.483
It's some good shit.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.709
I'm a hit it myself, and it's as small

35:53.710 --> 35:55.010
as an everyday.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.582
Yeah, but you haven't
told me what it is.

35:58.583 --> 36:00.033
It's a form of psychedelic.

36:01.972 --> 36:03.369
You'll see some weird shit.

36:03.370 --> 36:06.197
But it'll stop your mind
from fuckin' with you

36:07.096 --> 36:09.309
even for a little bit.

36:09.310 --> 36:11.810
Yeah, listen, that's the
best I can do, my friend.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.379
Alright, man, I really appreciate it.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.031
Yeah, don't worry about it.

36:17.032 --> 36:18.052
I don't have much money to pay you.

36:18.053 --> 36:19.040
Man, don't worry about it.

36:19.041 --> 36:21.439
This is on the house.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.430
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.481
Now where you headed?

36:28.780 --> 36:30.069
I was thinking about heading down to...

36:30.070 --> 36:32.170
I was thinking headin' over to the Bowery.

36:33.580 --> 36:34.580
The fucking bar.

36:35.620 --> 36:38.973
Jake, why would you wanna go down there?

36:41.478 --> 36:43.578
You know you only hurting yourself, right?

36:45.470 --> 36:48.469
Hey, man, listen I
really do appreciate this,

36:48.470 --> 36:49.470
the stuff, I mean.

36:50.260 --> 36:51.207
It was good seeing you.

36:51.208 --> 36:52.942
I think, I'm gonna be out though.

36:52.943 --> 36:55.149
Alright,
Jake, take it easy man.

36:55.150 --> 36:56.744
Don't be a stranger, okay?

36:56.745 --> 36:58.342
All right.

36:58.343 --> 36:59.599
Alright, thanks again.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.569
Hey, Jake, you be safe, man.

37:01.570 --> 37:03.280
Take care of yourself.

43:52.996 --> 43:54.293
Doesn't that feel good, baby?

46:24.540 --> 46:28.080
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Talent Show.

46:30.260 --> 46:33.083
I can see we have a packed house tonight.

46:34.410 --> 46:38.469
Either way, let's get this
show on the road, huh?

46:38.470 --> 46:41.459
I'm going to bring out your
first contestant of the evening.

46:41.460 --> 46:44.269
Her talent is singing,

46:44.270 --> 46:47.579
and she's recently single.

46:47.580 --> 46:50.483
You know what that means
guys, especially you.

46:51.920 --> 46:56.920
Please give a nice round
of applause for Ms. Molly.

48:09.109 --> 48:10.189
Thank you.

48:10.190 --> 48:11.977
One more time a nice round of applause

48:11.978 --> 48:14.036
for the lovely Ms. Molly.

48:17.148 --> 48:19.065
Singing about swinging.

48:20.430 --> 48:23.503
Now who's our next lucky contestant?

48:25.250 --> 48:26.879
How about you, sir?

48:26.880 --> 48:30.959
Would you like to come on up
here and show us your talent?

48:30.960 --> 48:31.960
What's your name?

48:34.900 --> 48:36.559
It's Jake.

48:36.560 --> 48:37.659
Jake.

48:37.660 --> 48:38.713
Take it away.

48:46.850 --> 48:48.850
How's everybody doin'?

48:52.191 --> 48:55.691
I'm not really good at this sort of thing.

48:56.525 --> 48:58.025
I'm not sure what I should do.

49:04.004 --> 49:05.171
Do you sing?

49:07.150 --> 49:08.150
No, I don't.

49:09.850 --> 49:11.100
You don't have to sing.

49:11.970 --> 49:12.970
What's your talent?

49:15.080 --> 49:16.380
I don't really have one.

49:17.730 --> 49:18.763
Sure you do.

49:23.430 --> 49:24.430
Your cock.

49:25.870 --> 49:27.603
Show them your cock.

49:28.590 --> 49:30.140
It's why you're here, isn't it?

49:33.130 --> 49:37.463
Ladies and gentlemen, once
again give it up for Jake.

50:14.074 --> 50:15.491
Tough crowd, huh?

50:16.934 --> 50:18.412
Listen, Jake.

50:25.710 --> 50:26.710
Silence!

50:29.522 --> 50:31.299
We have a consolation prize for you,

50:31.300 --> 50:33.700
something that'll make
you feel a little better.

50:45.440 --> 50:47.069
Come here, Jake.

50:47.070 --> 50:48.679
Come to me.

50:48.680 --> 50:49.680
Come on.

50:50.430 --> 50:52.129
Come on, Jake.

50:52.130 --> 50:53.599
You know you want to.

50:53.600 --> 50:54.600
Come to me.

53:07.660 --> 53:09.555
Hey, man, are you okay?

53:09.556 --> 53:11.093
You seem a little spaced out.

53:20.540 --> 53:23.090
Come with me there's
something I think you'll like.

54:59.700 --> 55:00.787
How you ladies doin'?

55:03.473 --> 55:04.623
What do we have here?

55:05.750 --> 55:06.833
Who's this?

55:08.470 --> 55:10.119
He's my friend?

55:10.120 --> 55:11.173
Does he speak?

55:12.420 --> 55:14.319
He's a little fucked up.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.919
I don't know what drugs he took,

55:15.920 --> 55:17.320
but he's not doin' too good.

55:19.420 --> 55:22.149
He just needs you ladies to wake him up.

55:22.150 --> 55:23.769
We can do that.

55:23.770 --> 55:24.770
Right girls?

55:26.100 --> 55:27.100
Definitely.

55:31.970 --> 55:33.023
Against the wall.

55:40.650 --> 55:43.673
Take off your jacket and your shirt.

55:44.700 --> 55:46.459
See this whip.

55:46.460 --> 55:47.710
We gonna use this on you.

55:48.550 --> 55:49.723
Turn around.

55:56.510 --> 55:58.151
How does that feel?

55:59.690 --> 56:00.523
Feels good.

56:00.524 --> 56:02.732
Is this what you want?

56:02.733 --> 56:03.923
Yes.

56:05.090 --> 56:06.660
Say it.

56:06.661 --> 56:07.744
Yes!

56:07.745 --> 56:10.607
You like being dominated by three women?

56:11.700 --> 56:12.779
Yes, I do.

56:12.780 --> 56:15.374
You like being our property?

56:15.375 --> 56:16.525
Yes!

56:17.500 --> 56:18.500
Good.

56:21.650 --> 56:23.352
Now hit her.

56:33.470 --> 56:35.023
Hit her now, slave.

56:40.390 --> 56:41.490
Harder!

56:48.040 --> 56:50.463
Now let's put him in his place.

56:55.170 --> 56:59.332
You are weak.

56:59.333 --> 57:00.333
Weak.

57:01.040 --> 57:02.493
You are helpless.

57:04.338 --> 57:06.533
Nobody can save you.

57:08.601 --> 57:10.157
Look at him.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.589
Hey, it's just me.

57:23.590 --> 57:27.439
I guess you forget to
pick me up at the station.

57:27.440 --> 57:29.433
Don't worry I won't tell mom.

57:31.150 --> 57:34.069
I'm headed to the hotel to
unpack and get settled in.

57:34.070 --> 57:36.720
You should definitely come
by later if you have time.

57:39.527 --> 57:41.869
I texted you the address and the number.

57:41.870 --> 57:43.229
Hope to see you soon.

57:43.230 --> 57:44.533
Love you, bye.

57:51.260 --> 57:52.260
Wild night, huh?

57:54.680 --> 57:55.680
Yeah.

57:58.710 --> 58:00.110
Who was that on the phone?

58:01.160 --> 58:03.460
Girlfriend doesn't know
about your other life.

58:05.730 --> 58:07.180
It was my sister, actually.

58:08.243 --> 58:09.243
Even better.

58:12.040 --> 58:13.040
I'm Erdy.

58:18.250 --> 58:19.250
Jake.

58:21.030 --> 58:22.507
Saw you in there.

58:24.051 --> 58:25.851
You seemed to be having a good time.

58:27.140 --> 58:28.640
How long you been coming here?

58:31.760 --> 58:32.879
A while.

58:32.880 --> 58:33.880
Yeah, me too.

58:35.244 --> 58:36.494
I like it here.

58:37.427 --> 58:39.827
You can pretty much find
anything you want here.

58:44.320 --> 58:45.723
I like finding new people.

58:50.680 --> 58:52.100
How come I didn't, uh...

58:53.899 --> 58:56.449
How come I didn't see you
engaging with the others?

58:57.440 --> 58:58.883
Sex really isn't my thing.

59:00.690 --> 59:01.693
After a while,

59:03.460 --> 59:07.259
your mind picks something
that really gets you

59:07.260 --> 59:08.260
and itself off.

59:09.999 --> 59:10.999
It sticks with it,

59:13.208 --> 59:15.008
at least that's what I think anyway.

59:18.880 --> 59:19.880
What's your thing?

59:22.967 --> 59:23.967
Well,

59:27.358 --> 59:30.108
you could follow me and find out.

59:33.960 --> 59:34.960
Follow you where?

59:35.984 --> 59:38.433
I got a place near here.

59:40.050 --> 59:41.750
You wanna walk over there with me?

59:46.400 --> 59:47.400
All right.

59:49.240 --> 59:50.993
No, no this way.

59:58.030 --> 01:00:00.813
Shelly, this is?

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.789
- Jake.
- Jake.

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:05.151
Jake, Shelly.

01:00:05.152 --> 01:00:08.149
Oh, what a handsome young man.

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:09.839
Yeah, isn't he?

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.889
Can I get you anything, Jake?

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:13.213
Nah, I'm fine.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.923
So, if you don't mind my asking,

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.210
what am I doing here?

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:31.963
Isn't it obvious?

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.883
You're gonna fuck my wife,

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:37.143
and I'm gonna watch.

01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:42.273
Oh, he's shy.

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:45.769
Why don't you put on some music?

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.519
Great idea.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.970
Anything in particular, Jake?

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:22.540
It's like the perfect balance
between joy and sadness.

01:01:37.481 --> 01:01:40.679
Well,

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.423
Jake, let's get started.

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:52.177
You don't have to worry, Jake.

01:01:52.178 --> 01:01:54.678
Nobody's gonna judge you here.

01:02:11.886 --> 01:02:13.429
Now pull her to face me.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.263
I wanna see my slut wife's face.

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:20.320
Pull her, pull her hair back.

01:02:23.442 --> 01:02:24.442
Yeah.

01:02:29.043 --> 01:02:30.876
Now start fucking her.

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.242
Hard.

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:44.015
Harder.

01:02:44.016 --> 01:02:45.430
Harder.

01:02:45.431 --> 01:02:46.431
Harder.

01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:48.309
Harder.

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:49.973
Fuck my slut wife harder.

01:02:57.085 --> 01:02:58.085
Yeah.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:20.830
Jake, look at you.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.339
You didn't think a pill and a Coke

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.373
will keep me away for good, did you?

01:03:34.792 --> 01:03:37.899
You know what you have to do.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.983
Now go do it.

01:05:15.547 --> 01:05:17.183
Go in and take a peek, Jake.

01:05:18.459 --> 01:05:19.663
You know you want to.

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:31.809
Jake, don't feel guilty.

01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:33.563
It's going to feel so good.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.420
Awe, it's gonna be the ultimate high.

01:05:40.886 --> 01:05:42.459
Hey.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.263
Baby brother, hi.

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:53.799
You left the door open.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.450
Yeah, I figured you might come.

01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:58.918
How did you know?

01:05:58.919 --> 01:06:00.609
Well, who wouldn't
wanna see his big sister

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:02.433
after two whole years.

01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:04.943
How do I look?

01:06:08.204 --> 01:06:09.669
You look good.

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:12.729
Yeah, I lost 10 pounds
since you last saw me.

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:14.199
Okay, let me go get changed.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.449
I'll be right back.

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:18.016
Oh, my god!

01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:20.870
I can't believe I'm finally
back in New York City.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.540
She does look
good, doesn't she, Jake.

01:06:28.647 --> 01:06:30.397
You should've taken a peek earlier.

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:33.043
I bet she looks good naked.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.343
No, Jake, we're not going anywhere.

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:46.559
Don't even think about leaving.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.583
We're too close now.

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:59.319
I tell you Colorado so boring.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.403
I can't believe I moved
out there for that asshole.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.520
Hey, what's wrong?

01:07:07.005 --> 01:07:08.172
Nothing I...

01:07:09.215 --> 01:07:10.959
I just have a headache, all right.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.143
Oh, okay.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.260
Well,

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.520
come sit with me.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:24.083
So, little brother, what's new with you?

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:31.343
Nothing much, just keeping busy.

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:33.379
Okay.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.323
Did you fuck any cute girls lately?

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:38.659
What?

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.523
Were any of them as cute as me?

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:46.029
Why do you wanna know that?

01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:47.829
You know why
she wants to know that?

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.163
It's just a question.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.139
I'm sorry to hear that
you and Monica split up.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:54.683
She was so pretty.

01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:57.460
How long were you two together?

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.640
Eight months.

01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:02.943
Wow, that's a pretty long time.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.229
Well, I guess we're both single now

01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:09.969
first me and Greg,

01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:11.193
then you and Monica.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.930
Why'd you guys break up anyway?

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.317
Let's talk about you.

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:26.500
What are you gonna do now
that you're back in the city?

01:08:26.501 --> 01:08:27.606
I'm not sure.

01:08:27.607 --> 01:08:30.792
Probably go try to get
laid, first and foremost.

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:34.198
See, I told you.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.500
Are you fucking with me?

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:38.149
No.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.658
Oh, wait, I almost forget.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:43.660
I almost forget.

01:08:45.109 --> 01:08:46.233
I got you something.

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:50.962
Happy belated birthday.

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:55.510
Thanks.

01:09:03.109 --> 01:09:04.109
Well, open it.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.249
Wanna know why it's blank?

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:30.113
So you can get started on the
next great American novel.

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:37.210
I don't write anymore.

01:09:39.363 --> 01:09:40.639
Oh.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.363
Really, why not?

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:46.303
I just lost the passion.

01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:51.412
Well, I'm sure you'll find
something to do with it.

01:09:56.544 --> 01:09:59.044
What did mom and dad give you?

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:07.330
Mom gave me money,

01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:14.373
and dad he gave me his hunting knife.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.493
Dad and his hunting.

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:22.469
Yeah, I bet he probably
missing you out there.

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:24.308
Look at her neck.

01:10:24.309 --> 01:10:25.309
Doesn't that look good?

01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:29.153
I'm so mixed up right now.

01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:34.770
I should leave.

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.209
If I stay, something bad's gonna happen.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:43.513
Jake, what do you mean?

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.693
I can't control myself.

01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:51.850
Feel your dick getting hard?

01:10:54.592 --> 01:10:55.666
Jake.

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:56.590
You want it.

01:10:56.591 --> 01:10:58.373
You want it 'cause I want it.

01:11:00.937 --> 01:11:01.937
You smell good.

01:11:04.674 --> 01:11:06.174
Well, thank you.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:12.203
But, Jake, you're really freaking me out.

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:15.310
Embrace it, embrace the high.

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:20.070
I'm sorry.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:24.460
I love you.

01:11:26.473 --> 01:11:28.349
I'm really sorry I have to do this.

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:29.350
Do what?

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:32.490
Jake.

01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:34.059
I just can't control myself.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.363
What do you mean?

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:37.533
Jake.

01:11:37.534 --> 01:11:38.713
I'm sorry I have to.

01:11:39.915 --> 01:11:42.099
You have to understand.

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.963
I have to.
- Jake, what are you doing?

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.269
Jake.

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:50.619
Jake, stop it.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.460
Jake.

01:11:51.461 --> 01:11:52.675
Jake!

01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:54.615
Stop it, Jake!

01:11:54.616 --> 01:11:56.575
Jake, get off!

01:11:56.576 --> 01:11:58.639
Jake, stop it!

01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.640
Jake!

01:12:00.679 --> 01:12:01.679
Jake!

01:12:19.478 --> 01:12:20.841
Jake, stop it!

01:12:20.842 --> 01:12:22.259
Stop it, stop it!

01:13:24.962 --> 01:13:26.129
Jake, stop it.

01:15:11.879 --> 01:15:14.379
No.

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.244
I love Monica.

01:15:36.219 --> 01:15:37.534
Fuck my wife.

01:15:37.535 --> 01:15:38.504
You just blew us all off.

01:15:38.505 --> 01:15:40.086
Everybody's got secrets.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.370
Wanna fuck me?

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:45.037
What do you want?

01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.180
Monica.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.993
Monica, you in here?

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:53.230
Jake.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.143
What are you doing here?

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:00.532
Monica.

01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:03.850
I miss you.

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:07.039
Jake, you really shouldn't be here.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.819
I have to tell you something.

01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.113
You have to listen to me.

01:17:13.053 --> 01:17:16.023
I'm fucked up.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.379
All I think about is sex.

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.159
I can't stop it.

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.683
I've done some bad things.

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:29.023
Tonight I did something I can't take back.

01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:38.863
I raped Molly.

01:17:41.006 --> 01:17:42.006
What?

01:17:43.464 --> 01:17:45.797
I don't know why I did it.

01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:47.870
I can't help myself.

01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:49.413
I can't control myself.

01:17:51.116 --> 01:17:52.766
I think, I wanted to hurt myself.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.621
Jake, I don't know what's going on,

01:17:57.622 --> 01:17:59.079
and I don't know what you did.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.199
But, you clearly need help,

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.938
and I can't be a part of it.

01:18:03.939 --> 01:18:06.989
Monica, I don't feel anything anymore.

01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:08.639
Jake, I have to go.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.139
Are you okay, who is this guy?

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.323
It's just my ex.

01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:13.230
No, I'm fine.

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.790
What's done is done, Jake.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.660
Tomorrow you will wake up,

01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:53.920
and we will do it all again

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.613
just like we always do.

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:01.170
This is who we are now.

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:46.937
Everybody's left you,

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:51.157
all these people in these photos,

01:19:52.595 --> 01:19:54.928
everybody you've ever known,

01:19:56.255 --> 01:19:57.672
everybody but me.

01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:31.040
And I will always be
with you, Jake, always.
