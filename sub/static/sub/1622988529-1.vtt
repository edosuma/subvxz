WEBVTT

00:12.888 --> 00:14.431
We'll be ready for you in five.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.106
We'll be ready for you in five.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.566
Okay.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.319
Are you sure there's not anything
we can get you before we start?

00:27.402 --> 00:31.114
A juice? Fruit? Tea? No?

00:31.949 --> 00:32.991
She's on the move.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.245
Do you want me to get you anything?
You're the star performer.

00:36.328 --> 00:37.454
I can go out and get it.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.165
Or if you want to go to the washroom,
now would probably be a good time.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.292
Sorry, can't get out of the leotard.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.586
Yeah. She's on the move. Let's go.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.297
I just want to make sure
that you're comfortable.

00:47.381 --> 00:51.093
I don't know if you've had makeup come
and have a last look at you.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.975
Okay. Places, everyone.
From the top. Let's move. Let's go.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.802
Well, look at you. I mean, seriously.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.515
Do you really think
you're pulling this whole thing off?

01:38.599 --> 01:41.101
The disco sex kitten look at your age?

01:41.185 --> 01:43.437
You're not fooling anybody with this shit.

01:44.396 --> 01:49.151
Wait. Wait. Hang on. Is that--
Gotta be kidding me.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.821
A giant fucking zit
right on your laugh line.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.325
Wrinkles and zits.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.702
It's a real sexy cocktail
you're serving up.

02:01.163 --> 02:04.333
Hello? Everything okay? Babe?

02:04.416 --> 02:05.667
Just a second.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.169
All right.
Just you've been in there forever.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.713
So, are you sure everything's all right?

02:09.795 --> 02:11.340
I said just a second.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.634
Maybe if you crawled out of my ass.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.094
Fuck.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.139
Just give it up. They don't fuck the face.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.143
-Hey.
-Sorry.

02:23.227 --> 02:26.563
Oh, no. Don't be. I was just
worried about you. That's all.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.273
I'm good. I'm fine. Just my stomach.

02:28.357 --> 02:33.612
Yeah, everybody left. They all took off.
Except for Simone, who is still here.

02:33.695 --> 02:38.408
And I'm pretty sure, I'm actually 100%
positive, that she is down to hook up.

02:39.368 --> 02:43.705
Everybody left, they said goodbye,
and she just stayed.

02:43.789 --> 02:48.836
So I was thinking, do you want to go and,
you know, close the deal?

02:50.462 --> 02:51.547
I don't know.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.465
But you said
you always wanted to try this.

02:53.549 --> 02:56.969
No, I did. Well,
I think I said I was open to--

02:57.052 --> 02:59.513
-If you've changed your mind--
-No. I haven't changed my mind.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.265
-I haven't changed my mind.
-Yeah, okay. All right.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.642
I just-- Are you sure she wants to?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.520
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.522
She was flirting with me the whole night.
You saw her.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.900
Plus, she was never my student. She
was in an entirely different department.

03:11.984 --> 03:15.529
And we're talking
way across campus, like, two quads over.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.282
So we can skip the whole ethical bullshit.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.785
And I thought that you
wanted to prove that you could be…

03:22.369 --> 03:24.705
you know… after the baby.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.748
But if I'm wrong--

03:26.832 --> 03:28.584
-No, no. You're not wrong.
-Okay.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.710
I just don't--

03:30.752 --> 03:34.006
I just feel a little unsexy.
That's all. I feel like a monster.

03:34.089 --> 03:38.969
Well, I don't see anything in front of me
except for my stone-cold sexy wife.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.138
But look. Hey. Here's the deal.

03:41.221 --> 03:45.559
I don't want you doing anything
that you are not 100% comfortable with.

03:46.643 --> 03:50.272
But… baby, remember?

03:50.939 --> 03:51.940
The old days.

03:52.024 --> 03:55.944
That freedom we had, how good that felt.
It was me and you against the world.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.530
Didn't that feel good?
Don't you want to feel that again?

03:58.614 --> 04:01.450
-I do. I do. But it's now, and I--
-Yeah.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.952
She's so young too. That girl down there.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.580
Oh, my God.
She doesn't even know what it was like.

04:06.663 --> 04:10.000
Right now, we could show her.

04:14.713 --> 04:15.714
I'll go talk to her.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.048
Yeah?

04:17.548 --> 04:18.550
All right.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.680
-Okay.
-Yeah? Okay.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.427
God, she's fucking flawless.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.347
How young is she, 19?

05:06.223 --> 05:07.975
I swear they get younger every year.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.436
Not you. You get older and zittier.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.483
I put something on. I hope that's--

05:16.567 --> 05:17.609
It's okay.

05:18.193 --> 05:21.113
You have the raddest classic records.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.116
People my age, or at least people
in this cultural fucking wasteland,

05:24.199 --> 05:27.578
they have no idea about this sound,
you know?

05:27.661 --> 05:30.664
Just listen to those guitars.
They're like--

05:32.749 --> 05:35.043
They're like my hear-- heart.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.547
Hey.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.382
Easy, easy.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.967
Sweetie, sweetie.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.261
It's okay. It's okay.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.930
Easy. Easy.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.433
Oh, my God. That was so embarrassing.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.809
No, no.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.188
You're, like, the best.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.355
You saved my life.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.191
Don't mention it. It's all right.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.985
God, Professor Rubin is so lucky.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.279
You can call him Danny.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.364
Danny.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.368
But it just--
It sounds so weird to say it like that.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.331
I mean, Danny,
he's obviously brilliant, right?

06:12.414 --> 06:16.960
But you-- you're just so cool and deep

06:17.044 --> 06:20.047
and just a total fucking fox
just to top it all off.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.634
I mean, if my mom
was even half as rad as you, I--

06:24.426 --> 06:27.846
Oh, shit. Shit. Sorry. I didn't mean--

06:27.930 --> 06:30.349
No, it's okay. I'm sure I could be.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.018
She's right. You could be.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.729
You better get this thing
back on the rails, grandma.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.941
No way. I mean, maybe, I guess.

06:39.024 --> 06:44.071
You guys are from
the same generation, I guess.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.448
But, like, she voted for Reagan.

06:47.324 --> 06:52.120
And you guys are just, like,
stuck in this whole '60s thing.

06:52.204 --> 06:53.330
Thank you.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.793
No. I don't mean stuck.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.171
God, I hate pot. It makes me so stupid.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.924
-What is the word that I'm looking for?
-Rooted.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.261
Yes. Yes! Totally.

07:07.886 --> 07:12.057
You're rooted, you know,
and, like, in a different time.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.394
And that's why
I think you're so cool, but--

07:15.894 --> 07:17.437
Why is she still talking?

07:18.272 --> 07:21.400
Also why Professor Rub-- I mean,

07:21.483 --> 07:24.653
-Danny is so…
-Danny.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.531
-Controversial?
-Disliked.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.492
In the department.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.581
Professor Rubin is getting fired.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.919
You know, there's still
a group of us, or at least some of us,

07:41.003 --> 07:43.172
who still really, totally love him.

07:43.255 --> 07:46.383
But in the department,
I guess he's sort of totally done.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.218
I think you better leave now.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.345
Shouldn't I say
good night to Professor Rubin?

07:50.429 --> 07:52.222
I'll give Professor Rubin your best.

07:54.558 --> 07:55.642
Okay.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.123
Hope you like sucking unemployed dick.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.342
Today you will eat clean, healthy foods.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.428
After school drop-off,
you will go directly to ballet class.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.181
You will do the full class
without a break.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.308
Afterward, you will have a veggie pita
from the place next door,

08:37.392 --> 08:39.727
and no chips and no soda.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.231
And if you do all these things,
then after dinner,

08:42.313 --> 08:45.859
you can have a reasonable serving
of cobbler with no ice cream.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.362
A glass of skim milk is just as good.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.657
None of these things are particularly hard
to do with a little fucking discipline.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.575
If you weren't so lazy,
you wouldn't have to do this.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.869
Other people don't need
this kind of fucking hand-holding.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.580
Earth to Sheila. Hello.

08:58.664 --> 08:59.748
Which tie should I wear?

08:59.831 --> 09:01.124
For the meeting with the provost.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.877
I think you should wear the mustard one.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.672
I like that. I bought that for you,
for your uncle's funeral.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.090
Oh, yeah. That bastard.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.299
What meeting?

09:09.383 --> 09:11.510
They called me in.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.012
Probably just looking for
the usual dog and pony show.

09:14.096 --> 09:16.265
But they knew what they were getting
when they hired me, right?

09:16.348 --> 09:18.016
I love you. Whatever happens.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.894
-You think something bad will happen?
-No.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.564
You chickenshit.
You have to tell him, seriously.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.148
I actually think
something good could happen.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.900
There's an acting chair position open,

09:26.984 --> 09:28.652
and I know
I'm considered controversial, but--

09:28.735 --> 09:30.612
Do you remember the Logans
are coming for dinner tonight?

09:30.696 --> 09:32.072
Oh, God. That's tonight?

09:32.155 --> 09:35.492
Any idea on what I should cook?
I thought I could do my pasta primavera.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.203
But Jack travels so much now.
That could seem a little provincial.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.956
Or I thought I could try out
the Moroccan tagine

09:41.039 --> 09:42.666
that you got me during your sabbatical.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.876
Maybe try something fun.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.295
I don't want to think
this much about food, okay?

09:46.378 --> 09:47.421
So just figure it out.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.465
Something that's
fun and interesting and not too uptight.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.550
How about that?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.345
You're the only one
who thinks about food this much,

09:55.429 --> 09:58.307
-you fucking freak.
-Hey, you owe me one.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.310
-Remember that.
-Tell him!

10:01.810 --> 10:03.937
Simone told me something last night.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.107
About your job.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.736
That it's in danger.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.487
But I think it's a good thing.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.866
You never wanted to teach political
history. You wanted to make history.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.034
So maybe this is your chance

10:17.117 --> 10:19.745
to step off the sidelines
and just get in the game.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.830
Run for office.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.002
I'm sorry, I've just been--

10:27.085 --> 10:28.712
I've been thinking about it for a while,

10:28.795 --> 10:33.550
and that's why it sounded so… ruminated.

10:34.384 --> 10:38.597
Honey, Simone is a cocktease
without a clue.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.723
I'm gonna go to work.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.643
Go get 'em, tiger.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.680
Hey.

11:19.763 --> 11:23.851
Morning. I was just looking at
the waves. Doughnut?

11:23.934 --> 11:25.394
No. Thank you.

11:25.477 --> 11:28.605
I buy them for the twins, but then
I finish them 'cause I'm disgusting.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.023
No, you're not.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.275
Liar. You can't stop looking

11:31.358 --> 11:32.943
at the back fat
spilling over her bra strap.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.570
You're as shallow as a kiddie pool.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.574
You want to go for a walk
around the new mall with me?

11:38.657 --> 11:40.826
-That sounds fun.
-If I make it around three times,

11:40.909 --> 11:43.036
I let myself go into Giovanni's
and have one of his expressos.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.329
Don't get sucked in.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.498
She's a riptide.
She'll just suck you out to sea.

11:46.582 --> 11:48.292
I have ballet, otherwise I would.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.751
-Ballet.
-But next time.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.211
-Yeah.
-Beautiful morning.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.713
Join us for sunrise song.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.424
Judah's mom made pumpkin bread,
and it's still warm.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.800
I can't. I have to go.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.052
Pumpkin bread so you
can turn into a pumpkin yourself.

11:59.136 --> 12:02.306
Short, round, lumpy. No one wants
pumpkin bread. Nobody wants you.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.599
Stop it!

12:04.808 --> 12:06.185
'Sup, lady?

12:08.020 --> 12:09.605
You're not supposed to park there.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.734
Well, you're not supposed to be
a fucking biatch, biatch.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.111
All right, asshole. It's go time.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.196
Sorry.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.281
Pathetic.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.870
Is that a look of pity?

12:24.953 --> 12:28.332
It is. She's covered in frosting,
and she is embarrassed for you.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.052
Even if you're late, you got here.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.845
So you miss a little warm-up.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.357
-It's closed.
-What? When?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.485
This week. You're surprised?
Everything else was gone already.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.904
The tanning salon, the travel agency.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.364
Abigail held out as long as she could.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.033
-They sold out?
-Everyone does eventually, right?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.701
You need a tanning bed?

13:04.785 --> 13:09.289
I'm sorry, I should say want.
Who needs a tanning bed?

13:09.373 --> 13:13.418
He's saying you're
pale, pasty, fat, gross, disgusting.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.432
There she is again.
Who is that skanky bottle blonde?

13:27.516 --> 13:30.686
And why are you so obsessed with her?
What's wrong with you?

13:33.021 --> 13:34.898
Now you've done it.
She sees you watching her.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.651
She sees everything about
what a fucking mess you are.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.455
Fruits and vegetables.

13:50.539 --> 13:54.042
That's what you're here for since you
skipped your dance class, you lazy bitch.

13:54.126 --> 13:57.004
Hi. How many eggplants
do you think I need for four people?

13:57.588 --> 13:58.755
What kind of people?

13:58.839 --> 14:01.383
Old friends. From the Bay Area.

14:01.466 --> 14:05.262
Buddies from the movement days.
Only now, he's a very successful author.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.141
And they're vegetarians. Like us.

14:10.851 --> 14:11.935
Six.

14:16.565 --> 14:17.816
Magic stuff.

14:19.276 --> 14:20.402
You want to try?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.905
You skipped ballet,
but you can still go running.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.073
It's not too late if you don't get stuck.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.160
Oops.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.287
You filthy bitch.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.584
You didn't even walk today,
let alone run or do ballet.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.962
And now look at you. Disgusting.
Sticky. Might as well just give up.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.383
…and at our brand-new food court,

14:43.467 --> 14:47.054
your family can enjoy cuisines
from around the world.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.722
Just tell 'em John Breem sent you.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.349
John Breem. Please, asshole.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.975
You're the reason
I don't have ballet today.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.477
You're destroying our whole community.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.687
Like we need
another fucking shopping mall.

15:02.027 --> 15:05.155
Go on. You know you want to.

15:17.334 --> 15:18.794
Fuck, that's good.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.082
Welcome to Pelican Burger.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.794
Three famous cheeseburgers, three large
fries and a chocolate shake. Thanks.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.384
-Here you go.
-Thank you so much.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.261
Have a nice day.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.399
Here you go.

17:12.616 --> 17:15.953
Okay. That's the last time. You're done.

17:17.746 --> 17:21.165
…taste of the times
When a snack this good

17:21.250 --> 17:24.670
Tastes as light as it should
You'll love Summit

17:24.752 --> 17:29.883
After only one bite
'Cause it's peanuts, wafers and light

17:29.967 --> 17:32.803
Summit cookie bars.
They're chocolaty with crisp baked…

17:32.886 --> 17:35.681
Tomorrow, I will eat clean, healthy food.

17:35.764 --> 17:39.017
I will find a new dance class.
I will walk on the beach.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.437
Tomorrow, I will have a nice day.

17:55.826 --> 17:56.910
Daddy!

17:56.994 --> 17:59.246
I made stuffed mushrooms.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.539
I don't want any food.

18:04.168 --> 18:05.502
Can I fix you a drink?

18:05.586 --> 18:07.546
I don't want a drink.
I don't want any food.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.798
I don't want any liquid,
and I don't want to live.

18:09.882 --> 18:11.550
Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.303
Hi. Hello. Okay?

18:16.346 --> 18:18.515
Sweetie. It's okay. It's just a bad--

18:18.599 --> 18:21.435
It's not okay.
Sheila, it's not okay. All right?

18:21.518 --> 18:23.520
You want to know what it was?

18:23.604 --> 18:25.564
It was fucking humiliating.

18:25.647 --> 18:29.651
I am sitting in there
like a goddamn asshole.

18:29.735 --> 18:34.072
Wearing a fucking tie.
A tie. And you could've warned me.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.409
I feel like I did.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.494
When I think about the time
and the talent that I wasted

18:39.578 --> 18:42.456
at that two-bit shithole of a college.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.959
The morons they gave tenure positions.
Chairs even.

18:46.043 --> 18:48.086
And they deny reappointment to me.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.338
I have nothing.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.633
If he's nothing,
what are you? Worse than nothing, you're--

18:52.716 --> 18:53.717
I disagree.

18:56.762 --> 19:00.516
You're gonna tell me
that this is my chance,

19:00.599 --> 19:04.019
my political phoenix
rising from the ashes?

19:04.102 --> 19:05.395
Yes.

19:06.522 --> 19:11.902
Hey. We didn't move here so you could
climb some bourgeois academic ladder.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.697
We moved here because
we drove down the coast.

19:16.615 --> 19:18.617
And we saw that limitless horizon.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.036
That Beach Boys song came on the radio.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.412
"Wouldn't It Be Nice"?

19:22.496 --> 19:24.998
Yeah. It was meant to be.

19:25.082 --> 19:26.625
Our home.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.877
-Remember?
-Of course I remember.

19:28.961 --> 19:31.713
And now that awful real estate developer,
John Breem…

19:32.923 --> 19:36.593
he wants every inch of our coastline
to have one of his shopping malls on it.

19:36.677 --> 19:37.803
And who's gonna stop him?

19:37.886 --> 19:41.807
There's no one with the vision you have.
No one with the brains.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.852
No one cares
about brains in politics anymore.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.229
Ronald fucking Reagan
was just elected president.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.731
I'm gonna have to find a job somewhere.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.902
Denison College reached out a while ago.

19:53.986 --> 19:55.362
-Ohio?
-Yeah.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.240
Ohio. Losers can't be choosers.

19:59.116 --> 20:02.327
Or whatever the idiotic expression
even is. Jesus.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.582
Oh, Jesus. They're early.

20:06.665 --> 20:08.917
-Who?
-The Logans.

20:09.001 --> 20:13.046
What? That's tonight?
Why didn't you tell me that?

20:13.130 --> 20:15.966
Yes, you did. But he's
too fucking wrapped up in his own--

20:16.049 --> 20:17.259
Feel like I did.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.927
What am I gonna say to him?

20:19.011 --> 20:21.263
He's got a fucking book deal,
and I don't have shit.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.932
Okay, so why don't you
stay in here and just rest?

20:24.016 --> 20:25.767
I'll tell them you don't feel well.
It's okay.

20:25.851 --> 20:27.269
No, no, no.

20:28.437 --> 20:32.274
You go get the stuffed mushrooms.
I'll get the fucking door.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.859
I'll get the fucking door, Daddy.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.158
Don't be silly. I'll clean up.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.910
You guys just sit there
and enjoy yourselves

20:42.993 --> 20:45.954
while I'm stuck in the kitchen
with this bitch.

20:48.123 --> 20:52.169
So, he hasn't told anyone
this yet, but we just got some news.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.797
He's gonna be a guest on Phil Donahue.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.175
Pretend you haven't heard of him.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.927
Is that a television show?

21:00.010 --> 21:02.346
Phil's a huge fan of the book, apparently.

21:02.429 --> 21:07.643
Our editor, out of her mind about it,
says it's gonna be huge for sales. Huge.

21:07.726 --> 21:08.894
Wow.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.689
The thing of it is, Jack had this--

21:14.441 --> 21:16.860
I don't know
if you'd call it a revelation,

21:16.944 --> 21:18.779
but a kind of clarity.

21:19.279 --> 21:24.326
The real way to make a difference
is to make a fortune.

21:25.869 --> 21:30.040
Right? I mean, to be
a person of influence, be heard.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.667
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.669
Well, it's very exciting news.

21:34.253 --> 21:35.546
Jack must be thrilled.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.632
He's a basket case.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.592
He was never the public speaker.

21:41.426 --> 21:46.014
Danny was the one who could
rile up a crowd. Inspire us.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.977
All those years in the movement.

21:50.853 --> 21:54.982
And when Reagan ordered the National
Guard on us, how scared we all were.

21:56.233 --> 21:58.026
It was Danny who spoke to us.

21:58.902 --> 22:02.489
You know?
Reminded us what we were fighting for.

22:02.573 --> 22:05.951
He made us calm, made us brave.

22:06.702 --> 22:08.036
Remember?

22:08.620 --> 22:12.124
Of course I remember.
It's why I fell in love with him.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.209
We all did.

22:15.586 --> 22:17.671
But you got him.

22:18.755 --> 22:23.594
Danny still gets speaking requests.
I mean, not Phil "Dona-who," but--

22:23.677 --> 22:24.678
-Hue.
-Donahue?

22:24.761 --> 22:25.888
-Donahue.
-Donahue.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.681
-Donahue, yeah. It's a really well-known--
-Donahue.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.809
He can really inspire a crowd still,
when he gets the chance.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.603
Look at her stomach bulging out.

22:32.686 --> 22:36.273
You're still skinnier, prettier.
She's the one who's huge.

22:36.899 --> 22:37.900
Do you want some cobbler?

22:40.110 --> 22:41.153
No, thanks.

22:41.236 --> 22:44.573
No, I somehow have to fit
into all these clothes we got

22:44.656 --> 22:45.949
for this crazy whistle-stop tour we're on.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.367
Oh, stop. You look great.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.954
No. You didn't have any.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.790
-I did.
-No, you didn't.

22:53.874 --> 22:55.792
-I did.
-You didn't have any cobbler.

22:55.876 --> 22:56.960
Don't think I didn't see.

22:57.044 --> 22:58.712
Just eat the fucking cobbler.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.548
-Hi.
-Hey.

23:02.049 --> 23:05.177
Did you know we have
a future state assemblyman here?

23:05.260 --> 23:06.553
Danny's running for office.

23:07.054 --> 23:08.972
-Yeah, that's right.
-Hell of a platform too.

23:09.056 --> 23:10.682
Coastal conservation.

23:10.766 --> 23:12.434
He's gonna fight real estate developers.

23:12.518 --> 23:14.770
Great idea.
Where have I heard that before?

23:14.853 --> 23:16.563
-Wow, that's so exciting.
-So happy.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.107
Listen,

23:19.191 --> 23:22.402
we were gonna save this news
for later, but might as well.

23:23.779 --> 23:25.864
We are expecting.

23:27.324 --> 23:28.450
A baby.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.287
Congratulations.

23:32.371 --> 23:34.373
-That's fantastic. Another round.
-That's amazing.

23:34.456 --> 23:37.960
She's not even fat.
She's pregnant. You stupid cow.

23:39.837 --> 23:41.296
I spoke to the Hausers,

23:41.380 --> 23:44.925
and they said if I'm up to the task…

23:46.552 --> 23:48.178
they're up for the endorsement.

23:48.762 --> 23:50.138
Wow.

23:50.222 --> 23:51.723
That's huge.

23:52.307 --> 23:53.976
I feel like he's putting on weight.

23:54.059 --> 23:56.687
Yeah, I just gotta come
and speak to his group.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.146
Dust off the old soapbox.

23:59.106 --> 24:02.568
That's excellent news.
I'm so happy to hear.

24:02.651 --> 24:04.194
He's definitely put on some weight.

24:04.278 --> 24:05.904
Gotta start making the rounds too.

24:05.988 --> 24:10.200
You know, glad-hand all the democratic
machers. Let 'em know I'm a contender.

24:11.326 --> 24:14.663
Do I have a suit?
I have to write a speech too. Shit.

24:14.746 --> 24:16.415
The one from your dad's funeral.

24:17.958 --> 24:20.544
You want me to use the speech
from my dad's funeral?

24:21.044 --> 24:22.212
The suit.

24:22.296 --> 24:23.422
Oh, right.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.008
My funeral suit.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.427
I buried both my parents in that thing.

24:29.553 --> 24:31.388
But you know what? That Shakespeare quote.

24:31.471 --> 24:32.639
That might actually work.

24:34.391 --> 24:35.726
You don't think it's too dark?

24:36.310 --> 24:37.853
I don't think so.

24:38.687 --> 24:41.440
"He was a man. Take him for all in all."

24:41.523 --> 24:42.608
No, I'm talking about the suit.

24:43.317 --> 24:45.277
Is it too formal?

24:45.360 --> 24:48.322
You know, are people gonna see me as some…

24:48.405 --> 24:49.448
Choking.

24:49.531 --> 24:50.741
…phony?

24:51.450 --> 24:54.828
Some scrawny Jewish poser from Berkeley

24:54.912 --> 24:56.955
trying to pull the wool
over everyone's eyes?

24:57.664 --> 24:59.583
Tell him how he can disgust you.

25:00.167 --> 25:01.251
The way he eats.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.545
His balls.

25:03.629 --> 25:05.506
How he sweats when he fucks you.

25:07.925 --> 25:09.927
I think they'll see you for what you are.

25:11.094 --> 25:13.722
A man with intellect and substance.

25:14.264 --> 25:15.766
A born leader.

25:20.771 --> 25:21.855
You know what you are?

25:23.315 --> 25:25.859
You are the bassline.

25:27.528 --> 25:29.279
Underneath the melody.

25:30.364 --> 25:33.367
Undetectable at times, but necessary.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.118
You know that?

25:36.370 --> 25:38.330
Without you, there's no song.

25:39.206 --> 25:40.415
There's nothing.

25:46.421 --> 25:47.422
We're gonna need money.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.591
If we're gonna take on
Breem and his cronies,

25:49.675 --> 25:51.552
at least a grand
to even get on the ballot.

25:51.635 --> 25:53.804
Then from there,
we can start to fundraise.

25:54.972 --> 25:57.015
We've got it in our savings.
We absolutely do.

25:57.099 --> 25:58.809
What are we holding onto that for anyways?

25:58.892 --> 26:00.060
You're not holding onto it.

26:00.143 --> 26:02.437
You ate it and flushed it
down the toilet, you pig.

26:02.521 --> 26:05.107
Big riptide today.
Look at that guy out there.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.484
How long until
he finds out what you've done?

26:07.568 --> 26:09.903
-You're just gonna wear yourself out!
-Five, four,

26:09.987 --> 26:11.321
-three…
-Gotta go parallel to the shore.

26:11.405 --> 26:12.447
…two,

26:12.531 --> 26:13.991
-one.
-Amateurs.

26:43.353 --> 26:45.230
I'd like to check my balance, please.

26:45.314 --> 26:46.982
Sweetie. I'll just put you down.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.237
All right. Stay calm. Stay cool.

26:52.321 --> 26:53.530
Be just a moment.

26:53.614 --> 26:55.574
I'm sure we have some cash.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.535
I know there's an ATM machine.

26:58.619 --> 27:01.914
I just, you know,
wanted to talk to a human being.

27:02.956 --> 27:04.458
Call me old-fashioned.

27:11.298 --> 27:12.424
Thank you.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.260
Next customer, please.

27:15.344 --> 27:18.889
Actually, I'm sorry.
Could I get a copy of my recent

27:19.848 --> 27:20.849
history?

27:43.163 --> 27:44.957
Anything else you need? Because…

27:45.958 --> 27:48.585
Well, I would like to make a withdrawal.

27:49.837 --> 27:51.004
How much do you need?

27:51.088 --> 27:52.214
Fifty dollars.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.967
Fifty plus 50 plus 50 plus 50 plus--

27:55.050 --> 27:59.179
You fat fuck! You fat fuck!
You fat, fat, fat fuck!

27:59.263 --> 28:01.223
Hello, are you in there? Are you okay?

28:01.306 --> 28:05.477
Hi. Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
I just didn't get enough--

28:05.561 --> 28:07.604
-Breakfast.
-Sleep.

28:08.605 --> 28:13.193
No. Anyway, so when Ernie told me
that Danny was asking about support,

28:13.277 --> 28:14.945
I was so excited.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.154
Who's Ernie?

28:16.238 --> 28:17.823
My husband.

28:18.448 --> 28:19.449
Oh, yes.

28:19.533 --> 28:20.951
Chairman of the San Diego Civics Club.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.996
They pretty much decide who is
and isn't getting campaign support.

28:24.079 --> 28:25.956
I thought I told you this.
No, I know I did. Yeah.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.916
Yes, yes. No, of course.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.460
But yeah, you weren't listening
to me 'cause I'm a boring, fat housewife,

28:30.544 --> 28:31.879
who's like,
"Why do you talk all the time?"

28:31.962 --> 28:33.463
No. Don't say that. You look great.

28:33.547 --> 28:35.257
Thank you. It's a new dress.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.593
That's exactly who she is. Fat. Boring.

28:37.676 --> 28:39.469
Who would listen to her?
Who would want to fuck her?

28:39.553 --> 28:41.513
That's where you're headed.
That's where you'll end up.

28:41.597 --> 28:42.931
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

28:43.974 --> 28:45.142
Mama.

28:56.820 --> 29:00.324
Three famous burgers, three large fries
and a chocolate shake, please.

29:02.534 --> 29:04.786
One more time.
One more run around the bases

29:04.870 --> 29:06.914
-and then never, ever again.
-Thank you.

29:23.180 --> 29:24.181
Fuck it.

30:20.112 --> 30:23.407
…and I'm the founder
of Breem Team Enterprises.

30:23.490 --> 30:27.244
The hallmark of our properties
is innovation.

30:27.828 --> 30:31.206
And nothing more exciting,
more telling of the future

30:31.290 --> 30:34.251
than the arrival of Video World!

30:34.334 --> 30:35.335
Where videotape allows…

30:35.419 --> 30:38.297
Oh, my God, seriously?
Is that fucking John Breem?

30:38.380 --> 30:39.464
He's actually kinda hot.

30:48.682 --> 30:50.267
You ready to do this thing?

30:53.061 --> 30:54.479
Take it to the right.

30:56.023 --> 30:58.025
And down. Up.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.612
Work those shoulders.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.450
And grapevine.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.413
And slow hips.

31:18.921 --> 31:20.631
Out, in. Here we go.

31:24.801 --> 31:26.094
Double-tap biceps.

31:27.596 --> 31:30.557
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.121
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

32:34.204 --> 32:35.205
Is she, like, dead?

32:35.873 --> 32:37.875
Should we, like,
call security or whatever?
