♪

00:20.672 --> 00:21.585
(Linda scoffs)

00:21.610 --> 00:24.312
(mumbling) Valentine's Day?

00:24.344 --> 00:25.655
Uh, Lin, are you saying something?

00:25.679 --> 00:27.747
No. Uh, just something in my throat.

00:27.781 --> 00:29.826
I can't believe they've been
acting like this all day.

00:29.850 --> 00:31.984
This is the weirdest
Valentine's Day ever.

00:32.019 --> 00:33.953
I don't even understand
what exactly happened.

00:33.987 --> 00:36.455
I saw the whole thing. It was awful.

00:36.490 --> 00:39.458
Aw. Good morning, my baby Bobby.

00:39.493 --> 00:41.427
Happy Valentine's Day. Oh!

00:41.452 --> 00:44.454
Bob, I just tripped over a
pile of your dirty laundry.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.208
Oh, uh, uh, sorry.

00:46.233 --> 00:48.592
Maybe, uh, just walk around it?

00:48.617 --> 00:50.202
No, I'm not gonna walk around it.

00:50.237 --> 00:51.515
Why is it even there?

00:51.540 --> 00:53.982
Well, you have your
pile of dirty laundry.

00:54.007 --> 00:56.279
Well, it's Valentine's Day, so,

00:56.304 --> 00:58.778
you know, maybe you
could just... move it.

00:58.812 --> 01:01.981
Or we could ignore it. That's romantic.

01:02.015 --> 01:04.050
Well, if this is your
idea of being romantic,

01:04.084 --> 01:05.618
it's not working on me.

01:05.652 --> 01:08.321
On a scale of this to
Michael Bolton, this is this.

01:08.355 --> 01:09.956
You don't have to
bring up Michael Bolton

01:09.990 --> 01:11.534
- every Valentine's Day.
- Oh, here we go.

01:11.558 --> 01:13.036
I'm never gonna be your Michael Bolton!

01:13.060 --> 01:14.694
You don't even try to be him, Bob!

01:14.728 --> 01:16.529
BOB: I grew my hair long once!

01:16.573 --> 01:18.307
Wow. That is dumb.

01:18.332 --> 01:20.466
And now Mom's weird idea that we all go

01:20.500 --> 01:22.902
on this family Valentine's
date is even weirder.

01:22.946 --> 01:24.880
Ugh. I'm just worried
they're still gonna be

01:24.905 --> 01:27.054
in a bad mood when
they find out about...

01:27.407 --> 01:28.541
the bed.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.334
(Tina groaning)

01:30.377 --> 01:32.011
ALL (chanting): Jumping on Gene's bed!

01:32.045 --> 01:33.980
- Jumping on Gene's bed!
- Aah! Aah!

01:34.014 --> 01:35.681
LINDA: Kids, let's go.

01:35.716 --> 01:37.183
We're leaving for the theater now.

01:37.484 --> 01:38.594
Looks fine.

01:38.619 --> 01:40.820
Well, hopefully, this
movie will soften them up.

01:40.854 --> 01:42.488
Mom's a sucker for romantic comedies.

01:42.522 --> 01:44.590
Yeah. She would watch
Four Hundred Weddings

01:44.625 --> 01:46.559
and a Thousand Funerals if she could.

01:46.593 --> 01:48.227
And Dad pretends he doesn't like them,

01:48.261 --> 01:50.196
but every time he
sees one, he dad-cries,

01:50.230 --> 01:52.531
and then downloads the soundtrack.

01:52.566 --> 01:55.401
When this movie is over, they
won't care about a broken bed.

01:55.435 --> 01:58.004
They'll be too busy making
awful middle-aged love.

01:58.038 --> 01:59.038
Aw.

02:00.741 --> 02:02.908
MAN (British accent): On
your left, you'll see the,

02:02.943 --> 02:05.244
um, uh, well, uh, the,
uh, famous London Tube.

02:05.278 --> 02:08.514
And on your right, you'll
see, uh, well, uh, Big Ben.

02:08.548 --> 02:11.584
And up ahead, you'll see
the, uh, um, uh, eh, the...

02:11.618 --> 02:13.419
the Royal Garden where
the princess enjoys,

02:13.453 --> 02:15.354
uh, tea with her,

02:15.389 --> 02:17.757
- um, family.
- He puts the glamor in stammer.

02:17.791 --> 02:19.959
(British accent): Enjoys
tea with her family?

02:19.993 --> 02:22.628
Who could enjoy anything
with those stuffy bores?

02:23.930 --> 02:25.652
Crap. Mom and Dad still look mad.

02:25.677 --> 02:26.799
Give it a second.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.473
I think we're almost
at the romantic part.

02:28.502 --> 02:30.603
Are you guys seeing all
these Whoppers on the floor?

02:30.628 --> 02:32.863
I'm gonna pick 'em up
just to throw them away.

02:32.906 --> 02:36.642
I, um, hope you enjoyed
the, uh, uh, tour,

02:36.677 --> 02:38.310
Your Highness.

02:38.345 --> 02:40.413
- (gasps) Shh!
- Aha!

02:40.447 --> 02:42.148
I knew you were the princess!

02:42.182 --> 02:43.593
(whispering): How did
you know it was me?

02:43.617 --> 02:45.384
I recognized your, um, famously,

02:45.419 --> 02:47.453
uh, slightly large nose.

02:47.487 --> 02:49.955
It's a fake one. It's my disguise.

02:49.990 --> 02:51.657
Oh! Oh, my God. I'm-I'm so sorry.

02:51.692 --> 02:53.125
(laughs) I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.593
It's my own nose. See? Look.

02:54.628 --> 02:55.995
Honk-honk. (laughs)

02:56.029 --> 02:57.063
I love this.

02:57.104 --> 02:59.252
I-I just wanted one normal day

02:59.277 --> 03:01.333
outside the palace.
Please don't tell anyone.

03:01.368 --> 03:04.580
It's a, um, uh, uh, deal.

03:04.605 --> 03:07.473
- Brilliant. Brilliant.
- Brilliant. Brilliant.

03:07.507 --> 03:09.275
- Brilliant.
- Brilliant.

03:09.309 --> 03:11.343
-Brilliant. -Brilliant.
-Here it comes.

03:11.378 --> 03:12.945
Bring us home, Rom-com.

03:14.548 --> 03:17.068
- Wha... ? What's going on?
- What the hell?

03:17.093 --> 03:18.851
That's it? Rom-com, thank you, Mom?

03:18.885 --> 03:20.943
No, kids, the movie's not over.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.321
There must be some kind of problem.

03:22.355 --> 03:23.923
Uh, hi, everyone.

03:23.957 --> 03:27.359
It seems we have a small
fire, popcorn-related.

03:27.394 --> 03:29.592
Anyway, since I'm not
allowed to scream "fire"

03:29.617 --> 03:32.107
in a crowded theater,
I'll just say it calmly.

03:32.428 --> 03:33.862
Fire.

03:35.035 --> 03:36.669
(muttering): Mm, stupid...

03:36.703 --> 03:39.371
(muttering): Of course there's a fire...

03:39.406 --> 03:41.123
Well, that was a bust.

03:41.148 --> 03:42.775
At least we got a
voucher for a free movie.

03:42.828 --> 03:45.152
No, I mean it was a bust
because we need the movie

03:45.178 --> 03:46.812
to soften them up, remember?

03:46.847 --> 03:48.481
What are you kids talking about?

03:48.515 --> 03:50.526
Yeah. What's with all the
sister-whisper back there?

03:50.550 --> 03:54.353
We were just talking about
what a super romantic ending

03:54.378 --> 03:56.213
that movie probably had.

03:56.256 --> 03:59.225
And, uh... Gene is gonna
tell you all about it.

03:59.268 --> 04:02.237
Yeah. Sure.

04:02.272 --> 04:04.473
Here's... what happens.

04:04.498 --> 04:07.666
The queen finds out that
her daughter, the princess,

04:07.701 --> 04:12.505
whose name is... Paula... McCartney...

04:12.539 --> 04:15.074
- Paula McCartney?
- Yep. Princess Paula McCartney.

04:15.108 --> 04:17.642
- Good, good. Moving on.
- Has escaped the palace!

04:17.677 --> 04:19.812
- And the queen's like...
- Boy, am I mad

04:19.846 --> 04:21.514
at my slightly big-nosed daughter.

04:21.548 --> 04:23.149
I'm the queen!

04:23.183 --> 04:26.051
So she calls for her best beefeater
to track down the princess.

04:26.086 --> 04:28.087
- He says...
- Righty-O.

04:28.121 --> 04:29.855
I'll just finish up this spot of beef,

04:29.890 --> 04:32.324
and I'll have a looky
for her royal heinie.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.493
So the Princess Paula
McCartney and the tour guide

04:34.528 --> 04:36.568
are being chased through
the streets, but they still

04:36.596 --> 04:38.430
had time to bond and be charming.

04:38.465 --> 04:40.766
By the way, we haven't
been properly introduced.

04:40.801 --> 04:46.572
My name is Scott... Jon... Dan... Steve.

04:46.606 --> 04:48.574
Wait. What? That's his name?

04:48.608 --> 04:50.985
Yeah. The character's name...
Scottjon Dansteve.

04:51.010 --> 04:51.777
Oh.

04:51.812 --> 04:53.589
- Well, Mr. Dansteve...
- Please call me Scottjon.

04:53.613 --> 04:55.014
Move over. I'm driving.

04:55.048 --> 04:57.183
GENE: Scottjon Dansteve decides

04:57.217 --> 04:58.684
to call his best mate for some help,

04:58.718 --> 04:59.685
a soccer hooligan named...

04:59.719 --> 05:01.253
Johnny Nottinghill!

05:01.288 --> 05:02.999
- GENE: Johnny's like...
- I'm watching footie

05:03.023 --> 05:05.224
on the telly in the
pubby where the beer is.

05:05.258 --> 05:07.426
You coming down or not, Scottjon?

05:07.460 --> 05:09.395
No! But I do need your help!

05:09.429 --> 05:11.797
GENE: Meanwhile, the beefeater
is gaining on the bus.

05:11.832 --> 05:15.038
Just as he's closing in, he's
bombarded by soccer balls!

05:15.063 --> 05:16.468
From... guess who.

05:16.503 --> 05:18.871
- LINDA: The hooligan!
- That's right! Johnny Hooligan!

05:18.905 --> 05:20.860
LINDA: I thought his name
was Johnny Nottinghill.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.491
GENE: Right. Shush. The
beefeater jumps on the bus,

05:23.516 --> 05:25.711
- and he's like...
- Princess Paula McCartney,

05:25.745 --> 05:28.914
there's an exploding scone
somewhere on this bus.

05:28.949 --> 05:32.818
If the bus goes under 50 miles
per hour, it will explode.

05:32.853 --> 05:34.486
Don't English people say "kilograms"?

05:34.521 --> 05:36.686
- Kilometers.
- Actually, no, they use miles.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.147
- We studied it in school.
- Nerd.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.391
- What?
- Oh, okay.

05:39.426 --> 05:42.405
(sighs) If the bus goes
under 50 miles per hour,

05:42.430 --> 05:43.963
it will explode!

05:43.997 --> 05:47.122
I guess you could say
we're in a bit of a jam.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.348
'Cause of the scone.

05:51.874 --> 05:54.982
So, wait. There's an
exploding scone on the bus?

05:55.007 --> 05:56.694
Is that... ? Wh-Why?

05:56.719 --> 05:59.353
Do you not know how scones
work? They're incredibly dense!

05:59.378 --> 06:01.208
There's all kinds of scones, Bob.

06:01.233 --> 06:03.067
I know there are all
kinds of scones, Lin.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.420
I'm just saying, why is it on a bus?

06:04.445 --> 06:06.256
There can't be a scone on a bus? God!

06:06.281 --> 06:07.686
Forget it. You're right. Fine.

06:07.711 --> 06:09.928
Well, at least they're
actually talking now.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.788
Yeah, but they're still fighting.

06:11.826 --> 06:13.647
We got to soften them up more than this

06:13.672 --> 06:15.706
before we get home and
they see the broken bed.

06:15.731 --> 06:18.202
Gene, try to put some
romance in your story.

06:18.383 --> 06:20.851
Got it. Anyway...

06:20.886 --> 06:22.520
the beefeater tells Scottjon

06:22.554 --> 06:24.248
and Princess Paula
McCartney that the person

06:24.273 --> 06:28.225
who planted the scone was
none other than... Big Ben.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.256
- I should have known.
- Who's Big Ben?

06:30.329 --> 06:32.420
My arch-rival. He's always been jealous

06:32.445 --> 06:34.334
that I'm the best
tour guide in the city.

06:34.359 --> 06:36.160
Now he's found a way to destroy me...

06:36.185 --> 06:37.385
and everything I love.

06:37.410 --> 06:39.546
Are you talking about the bus?

06:39.571 --> 06:40.873
Yes. And you.

06:40.898 --> 06:43.551
- Watch out for that tube!
- GENE: Princess Paula McCartney

06:43.575 --> 06:45.209
- looks up to see...
- (gasps)

06:45.243 --> 06:47.311
that they are headed
right into a giant tube!

06:47.343 --> 06:50.241
(all screaming)

06:50.266 --> 06:53.256
Gene, you know the London Tube
isn't an actual tube, right?

06:53.281 --> 06:55.849
And also, Big Ben is
a clock, not a person.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.476
- Okay, Professor Dumbledore.
- Hmm.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.602
GENE: They miss the tube just barely,

07:00.627 --> 07:02.127
but they still don't know how

07:02.152 --> 07:03.787
they're going to get off that bus!

07:03.812 --> 07:05.580
What are we going to do, Scottjon?

07:05.605 --> 07:07.573
I have an idea. Turn left up here

07:07.598 --> 07:10.033
where David Bowie and Mick
Jagger danced in the street.

07:10.058 --> 07:13.083
Then turn right up here where
Sir Ian McKellen once farted.

07:13.108 --> 07:15.349
Wow. You really are the
best tour guide in the city.

07:15.374 --> 07:17.074
- Look out!
- (gasps)

07:17.109 --> 07:19.143
GENE: They're headed
straight for a giant pile

07:19.177 --> 07:20.412
of dirty laundry.

07:20.437 --> 07:21.871
- (shrieks)
- GENE: Big Ben had

07:21.896 --> 07:23.364
strategically placed piles

07:23.389 --> 07:25.123
of dirty laundry all around the city,

07:25.148 --> 07:27.483
making it almost impossible to drive.

07:27.508 --> 07:29.014
Piles of dirty laundry?

07:29.039 --> 07:32.412
Are you talking about
the movie or... or me?

07:32.437 --> 07:35.239
Sometimes stories are so
universal, it feels like

07:35.264 --> 07:37.832
-they're speaking directly to all of us.
-Mm.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.424
GENE: Scottjon Dansteve

07:39.449 --> 07:40.998
and Princess Paula
McCartney find themselves

07:41.023 --> 07:43.577
headed straight for...
the London Bridge,

07:43.602 --> 07:45.703
which everyone knows is falling down,

07:45.728 --> 07:47.225
because there's a hit song about it.

07:47.257 --> 07:48.724
Um, I think you mean Tower Bridge.

07:48.749 --> 07:50.483
That's the famous one, but whatever.

07:50.508 --> 07:52.409
Don't bridge-splain me, Father!

07:52.462 --> 07:55.164
This was your idea,
Scottjon? The Tower Bridge?

07:55.198 --> 07:58.000
I didn't realize there was
a gap in the middle of it!

07:58.034 --> 08:00.511
(sighs) You know what we have to
do, right?

08:00.536 --> 08:01.337
Yes.

08:01.371 --> 08:04.106
Uh, let me guess. Does
she say, "Mind the gap"?

08:04.140 --> 08:05.741
Nuh. I don't know what that is.

08:05.775 --> 08:08.177
Mind the gap. It's-it's
what they say on the...

08:08.211 --> 08:10.379
Are you saying "mine" or "mind"?

08:10.413 --> 08:12.915
- Mind.
- Why would you mind a gap?

08:12.949 --> 08:15.651
- You... don't worry about it.
- As I was saying...

08:15.685 --> 08:17.653
You know what we have to do, right?

08:17.687 --> 08:20.022
Yes. Jump the gap.

08:20.056 --> 08:23.225
That's exactly right.
We have to jump the gap.

08:23.260 --> 08:26.362
-BOB: Oh, my God.
-GENE: Reminiscent of, but not at all

08:26.396 --> 08:29.561
plagiarizing Speed, the
bus launches off the bridge.

08:29.586 --> 08:33.422
(all screaming)

08:33.447 --> 08:35.081
- (whoops)
- We did it!

08:35.106 --> 08:36.405
GENE: They make the jump,

08:36.431 --> 08:38.015
but
dot-dot-dot...

08:38.041 --> 08:39.508
The bus's brakes don't work.

08:39.542 --> 08:41.210
GENE: Luckily, at the end of the road

08:41.244 --> 08:44.446
was a giant pile of... broken beds.

08:44.481 --> 08:45.981
The bed factory! Of course.

08:46.016 --> 08:48.150
Maybe we can use them
to absorb the impact.

08:48.184 --> 08:51.820
Yes. Broken beds are
incredibly good and great.

08:51.855 --> 08:54.456
GENE: The bus slams into
the pile of broken beds.

08:54.491 --> 08:57.693
The princess and Scottjon ride
the beefeater out of the bus

08:57.727 --> 08:59.584
as if he was a toboggan,

08:59.593 --> 09:01.237
- just as the scone explodes...
- (screaming)

09:01.261 --> 09:03.763
and dirty piles of
laundry fly everywhere!

09:03.797 --> 09:05.798
On the ground, they
lie on the beefeater,

09:05.832 --> 09:08.334
being super romantic,
and he's cool with it.

09:08.368 --> 09:11.704
Let's get married, have kids
and never, ever get mad at them.

09:11.738 --> 09:13.172
GENE: The princess is like...

09:13.206 --> 09:15.330
- Yep!
- GENE: And they kiss.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.842
And that's the movie.

09:16.877 --> 09:18.502
The end. Roll credits.

09:18.527 --> 09:20.279
What are you feeling?
What are you thinking?

09:20.314 --> 09:23.316
Wow. I don't know about you
guys, but I need a moment.

09:23.350 --> 09:27.517
Mom, Dad, you guys must be feeling
pretty Valentine-y now, huh?

09:27.542 --> 09:30.127
Uh, what was the deal
with the broken beds?

09:30.152 --> 09:32.019
- Why were they there?
- Beds break, okay?

09:32.054 --> 09:34.489
- It's part of life. Grow up.
- Whoa. Okay, Tina.

09:34.514 --> 09:36.425
Well, thank you for
finishing it for us, Gene.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.752
- It was... it was very exciting.
- Yeah.

09:38.777 --> 09:41.979
Too bad life isn't like a
movie and people disappoint you.

09:42.004 --> 09:44.906
Mm-hmm, yeah, and
sometimes people are clumsy,

09:44.931 --> 09:48.200
and they trip on things that
are perfectly fine to be there.

09:48.225 --> 09:50.714
- (Linda scoffs)
- Um, actually, I-I don't think

09:50.739 --> 09:52.019
Gene finished the movie.

09:52.074 --> 09:55.252
Uh, I-I mean, great start,
but, uh, there's more.

09:55.277 --> 09:57.737
Scottjon Dansteve and
Princess Paula McCartney

09:57.762 --> 09:59.362
survive the exploding scone,

09:59.387 --> 10:01.511
but that's just the
beginning of their problems.

10:01.536 --> 10:03.709
They're kissing like crazy
on top of the beefeater,

10:03.734 --> 10:05.769
but he's got something
to tell them. He says...

10:05.794 --> 10:08.191
Beg your pardon, Your Highness.
I've been sent to remind you

10:08.216 --> 10:10.527
that you're expected to attend
the royal wedding this evening.

10:10.552 --> 10:12.587
I completely forgot. Wait.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.248
Scottjon, why don't you come
as my date to this silly affair?

10:16.273 --> 10:19.476
Uh, I-I'd love to.
Uh, the-the problem is,

10:19.501 --> 10:22.503
only nobility and fancy people
can attend a royal wedding.

10:22.528 --> 10:24.162
I'm just a humble commoner.

10:24.187 --> 10:25.921
Well, then let's get noble.

10:25.946 --> 10:28.815
- Nobility makeover!
- Yay.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.527
TINA: Princess Paula
McCartney gets to work

10:30.552 --> 10:31.996
teaching Scottjon Dansteve how to fit in

10:32.021 --> 10:33.628
with fancy royal people.

10:33.653 --> 10:36.121
First, she teaches him how
to cross his legs at the knee.

10:36.146 --> 10:38.614
Then at the thigh, then at the butt.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.608
Let's practice that one more
time, just the... butt thing.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.850
Once more. And again.

10:43.875 --> 10:46.610
Once more, please. Again.

10:46.635 --> 10:49.673
- Oh, all right, Tina. We get it.
- And after all that preparation,

10:49.698 --> 10:51.644
there was only one thing left to do:

10:51.669 --> 10:53.570
teach Scottjon Dansteve how to speak.

10:53.595 --> 10:56.995
Scottjon, my dear, you know
I love your charming stammer,

10:57.020 --> 10:58.887
but it simply will not do.

10:58.912 --> 11:02.047
At least, not tonight when
you're giving your speech.

11:02.072 --> 11:04.106
Speech? Um, uh, w-well,

11:04.131 --> 11:05.956
I-I don't even know
whose wedding this is.

11:05.981 --> 11:09.668
It's mine. I'm betrothed
to the Duke of Douchebury,

11:09.693 --> 11:11.081
and I need a nobleman

11:11.106 --> 11:12.909
to object to the marriage,
or I'm stuck with him.

11:12.934 --> 11:14.534
TINA: If Scottjon Dansteve wants to be

11:14.559 --> 11:16.494
with Princess Paula McCartney,

11:16.519 --> 11:18.586
he has to give a speech
in front of the queen

11:18.611 --> 11:19.972
without stammering.

11:19.997 --> 11:24.031
Princess Paula McCartney,
I will not let you...

11:24.056 --> 11:27.572
- um, uh, uh, down.
- That's crap, isn't it?

11:30.424 --> 11:32.985
I can't believe Princess
Paula McCartney has to marry

11:33.010 --> 11:34.875
the horrible Duke of Douchebury.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.367
Oh, uh, hold on a minute, Lin.

11:36.401 --> 11:37.673
You don't know anything about this guy.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.632
Just because his name is Douchebury

11:39.657 --> 11:41.302
doesn't mean he's a...
Wait a minute, never mind.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.264
I-I don't know why I'm saying anything.

11:43.298 --> 11:44.642
(whispers): Go on with your story, Tina,

11:44.666 --> 11:46.344
and do even more of
that lovey-dovey stuff.

11:46.368 --> 11:48.936
On it. The royal wedding
was to be a river wedding

11:48.971 --> 11:50.438
on board a cruise liner.

11:50.472 --> 11:52.940
Ooh, a cruise liner. Fancy.

11:52.975 --> 11:54.542
TINA: All the guests stroll down

11:54.576 --> 11:56.444
to the docks, including
Scottjon Dansteve,

11:56.478 --> 11:58.446
who now looks as noble as the next guy.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.181
He passes by his mate Johnny Nottinghill

12:00.215 --> 12:02.083
outside the pubby.
Johnny Nottinghill's like,

12:02.117 --> 12:04.218
"Hey, Scottjon, you want
to watch footie with me?"

12:04.253 --> 12:07.722
Shh! I'm off to ruin
a, um, a-a posh wedding.

12:07.756 --> 12:09.567
TINA: On the cruise liner,
the wedding gets underway,

12:09.591 --> 12:11.035
and the queen herself is in attendance.

12:11.059 --> 12:12.660
And she's waving, and she's waving.

12:12.694 --> 12:14.529
When it comes time to ask if anyone

12:14.563 --> 12:16.631
has any objections,
Scottjon Dansteve stands up.

12:16.665 --> 12:19.033
- I object!
- TINA: The crowd gasps.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.802
And the vicar says, "Right, then.

12:20.836 --> 12:22.714
"Clearly by the way you
cross your legs at your butt

12:22.738 --> 12:24.616
"even while you're standing,
you are of noble birth.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.041
Please smoothly orate to us
the reason for your objection."

12:27.075 --> 12:30.654
I object for the reason that...

12:30.679 --> 12:31.779
um, that, uh...

12:31.814 --> 12:33.915
Wh... uh, eh, wh... um...

12:33.949 --> 12:36.484
TINA: But just then a huge boom
jolts the entire cruise liner.

12:36.518 --> 12:38.319
Seamen spill out all over the deck.

12:38.353 --> 12:40.321
Tina! Oh, wait. You mean sailors.

12:40.355 --> 12:41.889
- Never mind. Go on.
- Wait, what?

12:41.924 --> 12:43.891
- What did you think I meant?
- Nothing, nothing.

12:43.926 --> 12:45.493
- It's fine. You're fine.
- Anyway,

12:45.527 --> 12:47.005
there's a ton of seamen
all over the place.

12:47.029 --> 12:48.706
- BOB: Oh, my God.
- TINA: One of them screams,

12:48.730 --> 12:50.298
"It's a giant pile of dirty clothes

12:50.332 --> 12:51.981
"floating in the river. Evacuate!

12:52.006 --> 12:53.811
We've hit a laundry-berg!"

12:53.836 --> 12:56.003
(gasps) A laundry-berg? No!

12:56.038 --> 12:57.872
A laundry-berg? Really?

12:57.906 --> 13:00.708
- That's what sunk the ship?
- Well, if you must know, Dad,

13:00.742 --> 13:02.794
what really sunk the
ship was human arrogance.

13:02.819 --> 13:03.478
Hmm.

13:03.512 --> 13:05.223
TINA: Everyone starts
jumping into the water

13:05.247 --> 13:06.262
as the ship sinks.

13:06.287 --> 13:08.559
Luckily, floating nearby,
Princess Paula McCartney

13:08.584 --> 13:09.750
finds a broken bed.

13:09.785 --> 13:11.486
Thank God for this broken bed.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.522
Broken beds are way
better than non-broken beds.

13:14.556 --> 13:16.357
BOB: Wait, what's with
all the broken beds?

13:16.391 --> 13:18.236
TINA: I know, right? It
probably means something cool.

13:18.260 --> 13:21.097
Anyway, Scottjon Dansteve
stayed by the princess's side.

13:21.122 --> 13:23.564
I'm here, Princess, and, uh, uh...

13:23.599 --> 13:25.766
and I will never leave you.

13:25.801 --> 13:27.368
TINA: Just then, a dinghy floats by

13:27.402 --> 13:28.847
with the Duke of
Douchebury. He's like...

13:28.871 --> 13:30.404
I knew I heard you stammering before.

13:30.439 --> 13:32.039
You're a commoner.

13:32.074 --> 13:33.585
Other dinghies full of royals float by,

13:33.609 --> 13:34.819
and they start murmuring again.

13:34.843 --> 13:37.078
Now, listen here, all of you.

13:37.112 --> 13:38.880
Yes, this man is a commoner.

13:38.914 --> 13:40.615
And yes, he's quite unkempt.

13:40.649 --> 13:43.117
And yes, he probably has
to flush his own toilet.

13:43.151 --> 13:45.453
And yes, he may be loaded with diseases

13:45.487 --> 13:49.524
like rotten legs, pub penis,
ordinary skin syndrome...

13:49.558 --> 13:51.926
- Uh, um...
- Sorry, sorry. My point is...

13:51.960 --> 13:53.895
- Oh, oh! Wave!
- TINA: But at that moment,

13:53.929 --> 13:55.863
a huge wave crashes on top of them,

13:55.898 --> 13:57.632
sending Scottjon
Dansteve down the river.

13:57.666 --> 14:00.701
No!

14:00.736 --> 14:02.737
So, wait, there's a wave? In a river?

14:02.771 --> 14:05.406
Oh, an exploding scone on a bus is fine,

14:05.440 --> 14:07.608
but there can't be a wave in a river?

14:07.643 --> 14:09.577
I'm just saying,
rivers don't have waves.

14:09.611 --> 14:11.746
- Yeah, but the scone.
- Forget about the scone, Bob.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.548
I can't forget about the scone, Lin!

14:13.582 --> 14:15.426
TINA: And though their
love will live on forever,

14:15.450 --> 14:17.885
that's the last time
Princess Paula McCartney

14:17.920 --> 14:19.987
ever sees Scottjon
Dansteve, 'cause he's dead.

14:20.022 --> 14:21.923
Eventually, she moves to America,

14:21.948 --> 14:24.716
has eight kids who she never
gets mad at, and grows old.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.504
-(grunts)
-But every time she trips over a pile

14:26.528 --> 14:28.496
of dirty laundry, she thinks of him.

14:28.530 --> 14:29.664
The end.

14:29.698 --> 14:31.232
Wait, what? That's the end?

14:31.266 --> 14:34.001
Yeah, basically. Um,
anyway, what do you think?

14:34.036 --> 14:36.404
It has everything, right?
Tragedy? Action? Passion?

14:36.438 --> 14:38.673
Huh. I guess. Kinda.

14:38.707 --> 14:40.908
I mean, I'm glad you finished it.

14:40.943 --> 14:43.578
Also, it's perfect
timing, 'cause we're home.

14:43.603 --> 14:45.604
Everyone go up. I'll park the car.

14:45.629 --> 14:47.630
Well, some Valentine's Day that was.

14:47.655 --> 14:49.399
Oh, God. We're back at
the scene of the crime,

14:49.451 --> 14:50.818
and they're still in a bad mood.

14:50.852 --> 14:52.130
We're gonna get grounded so hard.

14:52.154 --> 14:53.854
I can't take it, man. I can't take it.

14:53.889 --> 14:55.833
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Hold on.

14:55.857 --> 14:57.425
We can't get out of the car yet.

14:57.459 --> 14:59.827
- There's more to the movie.
- There is?

14:59.861 --> 15:01.996
Yes. Gene and Tina forgot to tell you

15:02.030 --> 15:04.465
the super exciting, crazy dramatic,

15:04.499 --> 15:07.835
ultra-romantic finale after the finale.

15:07.869 --> 15:09.948
Uh, Louise, can you just
tell us when we get upstairs?

15:09.972 --> 15:11.472
Or maybe just write it down somewhere?

15:11.506 --> 15:13.217
I have to tell you
before we go in the house.

15:13.241 --> 15:14.375
It's super quick.

15:14.409 --> 15:15.810
Let's all park the car together,

15:15.844 --> 15:17.488
and we'll just let her
tell us, right, Bob?

15:17.512 --> 15:18.713
(sighs) All right.

15:18.747 --> 15:20.781
- Let's hear it.
- So, after being

15:20.816 --> 15:22.984
tossed around in the
river, Scottjon Dansteve

15:23.018 --> 15:24.885
washes up, coughing.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.150
Turns out he's not dead, Tina,

15:28.175 --> 15:30.947
- and he's happy to be alive.
- I'm alive.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.547
LOUISE: But he's sad that he lost

15:32.574 --> 15:34.174
his Princess Paula McCartney

15:34.209 --> 15:35.776
to the Duke of Douchebury.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.502
Luckily, he's really close to home,

15:37.527 --> 15:39.762
which is a flat above
an English muffin shop,

15:39.814 --> 15:43.030
which, if you're in England,
is just called a muffin shop.

15:43.055 --> 15:44.461
He lived there with his hooligan mate,

15:44.485 --> 15:45.619
Johnny Nottinghill.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.787
And it wasn't a great flat.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.422
Pretty crappy, actually,

15:48.456 --> 15:50.565
and full of little
piles of dirty laundry.

15:50.590 --> 15:52.392
- I knew it.
- All right, Johnny,

15:52.427 --> 15:54.428
- let's watch some footie.
- LOUISE: Suddenly,

15:54.453 --> 15:56.454
there's a sound behind
him. He turns around.

15:56.479 --> 15:58.113
Princess Paula McCartney is standing

15:58.138 --> 15:59.705
in the doorway of his flat.

15:59.767 --> 16:02.569
- Honk, honk.
- Princess Paula McCartney.

16:02.604 --> 16:04.071
Hello, Scottjon Dansteve.

16:04.105 --> 16:06.807
Oh, um, sorry. Uh, can I introduce you

16:06.841 --> 16:08.909
to Johnny Something-face.

16:08.943 --> 16:11.445
LOUISE: Johnny's like,
"Ello. Football to ya."

16:11.479 --> 16:14.548
Scottjon, look, I was scared
of what my family would think,

16:14.582 --> 16:16.583
but I realize now that it's all rubbish.

16:16.618 --> 16:19.653
I'm just a girl standing
in front of a tour guide

16:19.687 --> 16:21.955
next to his football friend
above an English muffin shop,

16:21.990 --> 16:23.390
which is just a muffin shop,

16:23.424 --> 16:25.325
holding in a toot, asking him to...

16:25.360 --> 16:27.261
LOUISE: Just then, she
trips over something.

16:27.295 --> 16:29.930
Scottjon, I've just tripped
over your pile of dirty laundry.

16:29.964 --> 16:31.231
Oh, um, sorry.

16:31.266 --> 16:33.934
Uh, perhaps just, uh, walk around it?

16:33.968 --> 16:35.387
"Just walk around it"?

16:35.412 --> 16:39.006
Don't you have your own piles
of dirty laundry at the palace?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.742
Yes, but perhaps you
could simply move it.

16:41.776 --> 16:44.244
Or we could, um, ignore it?

16:44.279 --> 16:46.246
Which I find equally romantic.

16:46.271 --> 16:48.282
(exhales) If that's what you
fancy as romance, Scottjon,

16:48.307 --> 16:50.017
then I want no part of it.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.286
On a scale of one to Sir Michael Bolton,

16:52.320 --> 16:54.154
I consider this... this.

16:54.188 --> 16:56.089
LOUISE: It's the dumbest argument ever.

16:56.124 --> 16:58.859
But as they fight, something
strange starts to happen.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.360
Piles of laundry

17:00.395 --> 17:03.030
begin to rise up and swirl around them.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.265
Scottjon and Princess Paula McCartney

17:05.300 --> 17:07.968
are so wrapped up in their
argument that they don't see

17:07.992 --> 17:09.704
that the laundry piles
have formed a twister

17:09.737 --> 17:11.271
the size of a building.

17:11.296 --> 17:15.031
So, it's a supernatural
twister of... laundry.

17:15.057 --> 17:17.157
LOUISE: You know what?
You're right. Not believable.

17:17.211 --> 17:19.012
Anyway, some other stuff happens.

17:19.047 --> 17:21.191
You don't want to hear it.
Long day. We're home. The end.

17:21.215 --> 17:23.042
Wait, wait, wait. You can't stop there.

17:23.068 --> 17:24.460
They end up together, right?

17:24.484 --> 17:26.853
W-We do want to hear it.
Just tell us how it ends.

17:26.897 --> 17:28.420
- Tell us.
- Okay, fine.

17:28.444 --> 17:30.891
Scottjon and Princess Paula McCartney

17:30.925 --> 17:33.293
don't realize that all their
negative energy is creating

17:33.328 --> 17:35.028
a-a-a...

17:35.063 --> 17:38.465
a laundry-nado!

17:38.499 --> 17:40.600
GENE: Oh, laundry-Na-do you didn't.

17:43.993 --> 17:46.538
Scottjon Dansteve and Princess
Paula McCartney's argument

17:46.563 --> 17:49.265
threatens the whole town,
but they have no idea.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.655
They're too busy
arguing like dumb idiots.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.305
Like dumb, stupid, arguing idiots.

17:54.330 --> 17:56.341
Okay, take it easy, Louise.

17:56.384 --> 17:57.695
- SCOTTJON: Argue. Argue.
- PAULA: Argue.

17:57.719 --> 17:59.163
- Argue, argue. Argue.
- Argue, argue. Argue.

17:59.187 --> 18:00.454
LOUISE: A bed from the flat

18:00.488 --> 18:01.689
is whipped up into the sky

18:01.723 --> 18:02.856
and snapped like a twig.

18:02.891 --> 18:04.291
BOB: Uh, let me guess.

18:04.325 --> 18:06.727
Does the broken bed
somehow fix all of this?

18:06.752 --> 18:07.820
No, it doesn't.

18:07.845 --> 18:10.549
This time, not even a
broken bed could save them.

18:10.574 --> 18:12.208
Although, that's a really good guess,

18:12.233 --> 18:14.149
because broken beds usually are great.

18:14.174 --> 18:16.637
But no. They realize
that the laundry-nado

18:16.662 --> 18:19.030
is making a noise.

18:19.074 --> 18:23.844
LAUNDRY-NADO (booming voice): Sorry!

18:23.878 --> 18:26.380
I-I think it's apologizing to us.

18:26.414 --> 18:29.783
Uh, oh, okay. Apology accepted.

18:29.808 --> 18:32.409
LAUNDRY-NADO: Not me! You!

18:32.434 --> 18:34.868
You say sorry!

18:34.923 --> 18:36.423
Geez.

18:36.458 --> 18:37.945
LOUISE: In order to save the town,

18:37.970 --> 18:39.904
Scottjon Dansteve and
Princess Paula McCartney

18:39.929 --> 18:41.797
would have to do the unthinkable.

18:41.822 --> 18:45.859
They would have to...
apologize to each other.

18:45.884 --> 18:49.012
Oh. That's... a plot twist.

18:49.037 --> 18:51.071
Does Scottjon apologize first?

18:51.106 --> 18:52.906
'Cause he... should.

18:52.941 --> 18:54.708
I've never seen this movie before,

18:54.733 --> 18:56.734
but it feels like
Princess Paula McCartney

18:56.759 --> 18:58.460
would probably apologize first.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.720
Ugh. As long as the two lovers

19:00.745 --> 19:03.766
refuse to say a simple
"I'm sorry" to each other,

19:03.791 --> 19:06.559
the laundry-nado continues
to rip the town apart.

19:06.788 --> 19:08.623
First the London Bridge falls down,

19:08.648 --> 19:10.515
- which we all saw coming.
- BOB: Tower Bridge.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.938
LOUISE: Then the royal
palace is wiped out.

19:12.963 --> 19:16.606
And then Big Ben is swooped
up, the clock and the guy.

19:16.631 --> 19:18.966
Finally, realizing
they're both being stupid,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.235
stupid morons, Scottjon Dansteve

19:21.260 --> 19:23.828
and Princess Paula
McCartney agree to apologize

19:23.853 --> 19:25.520
at the exact same time.

19:25.545 --> 19:27.713
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

19:27.738 --> 19:29.716
I'm sorry I got so angry
about the pile of laundry.

19:29.741 --> 19:31.708
I was a real wanker
about the whole thing.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.024
I was just embarrassed
about my dodgy flat.

19:33.049 --> 19:33.610
I was just hoping

19:33.635 --> 19:35.447
we could have a nice day
together after my royal wedding

19:35.472 --> 19:37.083
-and the whole exploding scone thing.
-I felt bad

19:37.108 --> 19:38.575
that you tripped on my dirty laundry.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.944
LOUISE: The laundry-nado
immediately goes away.

19:39.969 --> 19:41.269
Everything falls to the ground.

19:41.294 --> 19:42.894
Scottjon and the princess

19:42.919 --> 19:44.519
realize they're holding hands.

19:44.544 --> 19:45.711
There's music and stuff.

19:45.736 --> 19:48.944
Cut to Westminster Abbey
Road. I think that's a place.

19:48.969 --> 19:50.503
They get married there.

19:50.528 --> 19:52.453
As a wedding gift, the queen gives them

19:52.478 --> 19:55.011
a brand-new royal bed. She says...

19:55.036 --> 19:57.504
It was surprisingly affordable.

19:57.539 --> 20:01.575
In fact, everyone should get
a new bed every once in a while

20:01.609 --> 20:03.744
since they break pretty easily.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.805
Then they have 15 kids,
who they never get mad at,

20:06.830 --> 20:08.631
and they live happily ever after,

20:08.656 --> 20:10.157
and that's how the movie ends.

20:10.182 --> 20:12.375
Fade to black. Roll credits.

20:13.454 --> 20:15.489
Lin, I-I want to say something.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.715
No, Bob. Let me say it first.

20:17.740 --> 20:19.541
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.167
No, you don't need to apologize.

20:21.192 --> 20:23.393
I was the one who was
acting like a jerk.

20:23.418 --> 20:25.720
Yeah, but I could have
been nicer about it.

20:25.745 --> 20:28.413
So, is everyone feeling
less crappy, then?

20:28.438 --> 20:30.005
Aw, my babies.

20:30.030 --> 20:32.132
That was my favorite
movie I've never seen.

20:32.157 --> 20:33.824
Yeah, it was pretty good.

20:33.849 --> 20:35.683
- Are you crying, Dad?
- No. I...

20:35.708 --> 20:38.276
My, uh, my ch-cheeks are just sweaty.

20:38.301 --> 20:40.441
Oh, Bobby.

20:40.466 --> 20:43.602
I guess you could kind of say we
saved your Valentine's Day, huh?

20:43.627 --> 20:44.994
Yeah, I guess you did.

20:45.019 --> 20:46.820
By the way, can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

20:46.845 --> 20:48.112
- Uh, wait. Why?
- Why?

20:48.137 --> 20:49.648
Because we broke Gene's
bed jumping on it,

20:49.673 --> 20:51.211
and now you probably
have to buy him a new one.

20:51.236 --> 20:51.555
(laughs)

20:51.580 --> 20:52.513
Happy Valentine's Day.
Love you, guys. Bye.

20:52.538 --> 20:54.813
TINA: Run, run, run!

20:54.838 --> 20:56.172
Oh, my God.
