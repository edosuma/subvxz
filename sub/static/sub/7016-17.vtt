WEBVTT

00:02.367 --> 00:04.065
Steven,

00:04.296 --> 00:08.296
why is there lingerie behind my canned goods ?

00:08.729 --> 00:11.028
Oh, sorry. That's Sam's.

00:11.194 --> 00:16.524
Before we split up, our love life felt a little boring so
we decided to branch out and try some new locations.

00:17.195 --> 00:20.860
By the way, this is a good sturdy table.

00:21.259 --> 00:24.358
Oh, Steven.

00:26.190 --> 00:27.822
Good morning !

00:28.004 --> 00:32.585
Morning Red. You're up early. You're retired,
you should be sleeping in.

00:32.772 --> 00:38.382
Yeah, well, I was awoken by the pleasant sound
of birds chirping outside my window.

00:38.765 --> 00:43.070
And now that I don't have to work,
I finally have time to poison them.

00:43.963 --> 00:46.519
I feed those birds bread every day.

00:46.649 --> 00:49.305
Good, that will make it easier.

00:49.904 --> 00:53.171
Red, I don’t think you’ve embraced
retirement yet.

00:53.279 --> 00:56.603
What you need to do is to get yourself a robe,
go sit down on the porch

00:56.737 --> 01:00.590
and shake your fists and yell things
like:“dang nabbit, why I outta...”

01:00.927 --> 01:04.991
I have to say, I looked forward to retirement
as much as I looked forward to

01:05.075 --> 01:07.020
playing catch with my son.

01:07.298 --> 01:10.252
And both of them have left me bitterly disappoint.

01:11.718 --> 01:13.602
Well, you know,

01:13.777 --> 01:15.311
we could take a trip.

01:15.377 --> 01:21.192
When Amy O’Brian’s husband retired, they went to
see the Nutcracker museum in Rhode Island.

01:21.325 --> 01:27.631
We don’t have to go anywhere that fancy but there is
that cave in West Virginia I’ve been wanting to see.

01:27.808 --> 01:31.322
It’s a good idea Red. You and Kitty should travel,
you know, see the world.

01:31.377 --> 01:34.761
I saw the world when I was in the navy.
It shot at me.

01:35.615 --> 01:40.121
I don’t know... West Virginia is supposed
to be pretty nice.

01:40.867 --> 01:44.470
It is the Ohio of the Atlantic states.

01:45.725 --> 01:49.151
Well, if you need something to do, you can always
come down to help me at the record store.

01:49.617 --> 01:51.630
There’s a light switch that keeps shocking people.

01:51.988 --> 01:55.993
Although on the upside the jolts seems to
make Leo remember stuff.

01:56.268 --> 01:59.783
Yeah ! Sure, I’ll help you out. It will be good to
get out of the house.

01:59.985 --> 02:03.931
If I have to listen to Phil Donahue tell
one more housewife

02:03.987 --> 02:06.351
that it isn’t her fault that her life is messed up

02:06.378 --> 02:10.371
I gonna drive to Chicago and hit him
in the head with a hammer.

02:14.866 --> 02:18.283
Okay, Donna, I have something to admit to you but
it’s something really embarrassing.

02:18.467 --> 02:21.041
You read a book for pleasure ?

02:27.398 --> 02:29.732
I like Fez.

02:34.027 --> 02:36.003
Wow !

02:37.526 --> 02:42.443
Well I guess the only thing I have to say is,
I freaking knew it !

02:42.535 --> 02:43.540
Donna !

02:43.626 --> 02:48.193
Look, I know I made that stupid list to figure out
who my perfect match should be, and you were right,

02:48.478 --> 02:49.733
it’s Fez.

02:49.868 --> 02:52.661
This is one of the biggest thing
I’ve ever heard you said.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.941
I know, I know. I can’t believe I like him.

02:56.157 --> 02:59.021
No ! You admitted I was right.

03:01.367 --> 03:04.193
Okay, are you sure you like Fez ?
I mean,

03:04.807 --> 03:07.733
think about all the things you said
about him over the years.

03:09.718 --> 03:11.140
He’s a bad, poor,

03:11.166 --> 03:11.620
sweaty,

03:11.645 --> 03:12.743
stinky, crazy,

03:12.788 --> 03:13.511
sick,

03:13.587 --> 03:14.603
ridiculous,

03:14.698 --> 03:15.963
foreign, spazoid,

03:16.117 --> 03:17.263
weirdo.

03:18.418 --> 03:21.080
Okay, alright Donna, you busted me.

03:21.178 --> 03:27.072
I like a bad, poor, sweaty, sticky, crazy,
ridiculous, sick, foreign, spazoid, weirdo.

03:29.317 --> 03:31.751
Hey lucious ladies !

03:34.008 --> 03:35.141
Hey, Fez.

03:35.347 --> 03:38.591
Hey, Fez !
What’s up ?

03:40.085 --> 03:43.230
Well, I made up a new way to play Candy Land,

03:43.336 --> 03:46.870
where I will eat the appropriate candy
for each square I land on.

03:47.525 --> 03:52.611
So Jackie, get prepared to come home to
a candy-covered-pants-less roommate.

03:53.325 --> 03:57.280
Wait ! Why do you have to take your
pants off to play ?

03:58.185 --> 04:00.800
You don’t know me at all !

04:05.628 --> 04:06.991
There it goes, Jackie.

04:07.827 --> 04:11.422
Your candy-covered-pants-less prince charming.

Fez, now that I’m spending so much time here,
maybe you should get a water bed.

04:57.065 --> 04:59.233
That  way we won’t keep Jackie up with all the...

04:59.346 --> 05:00.832
squeaking.

05:01.348 --> 05:03.523
Yeah, sorry about that.

05:03.627 --> 05:05.763
I’m a squeaker.

05:07.556 --> 05:11.570
Donna... I like a squeaker.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.010
Wh, what I am gonna do ?

05:15.226 --> 05:16.213
Okay look,

05:17.027 --> 05:18.381
a few years ago,

05:18.795 --> 05:21.962
- I went to see a therapist.
- Looser

05:22.498 --> 05:25.202
My parents were going through their
divorce and it helped.

05:25.528 --> 05:28.073
Not everyone who goes to a therapist is a looser.

05:28.388 --> 05:29.551
Ok wait so,

05:29.887 --> 05:32.601
- you think this therapist actually helped you ?
- Yeah !

05:33.017 --> 05:36.673
He must be pretty good if he convinced
you you’re not a looser.

05:42.738 --> 05:44.750
Ouah, man ! Impressive !

05:44.878 --> 05:47.413
Yeah, Mr Forman is real good at fixing stuff.

05:47.707 --> 05:51.220
No, 6 across, impressive.

05:52.627 --> 05:53.961
No wait,

05:54.068 --> 05:56.502
that’s more than 3 letters.

05:59.415 --> 06:00.552
There you go !

06:00.705 --> 06:02.870
Oh, nice job Red.

06:03.248 --> 06:06.150
The only problem is that now I can
see how dirty everything is.

06:06.687 --> 06:08.343
I gotta do something about that.

06:10.095 --> 06:11.861
There you go.

06:12.377 --> 06:14.653
Alright man, thanks. I guess
I’ll see you later.

06:14.935 --> 06:18.032
Actually I thought I’d fix that wobbly
chair before I left.

06:18.476 --> 06:20.831
Take a high, carphead !

06:23.646 --> 06:25.583
Hey, quiet !

06:26.447 --> 06:28.920
Oh, sorry, it’s quilt.

06:34.555 --> 06:37.663
I’m just saying, I can’t believe
I’m in a therapist office.

06:37.988 --> 06:41.951
I mean, there is no way I’ll be able to
talk for a whole hour.

06:44.848 --> 06:48.701
Well, thank you Dr. Hamond.

06:50.776 --> 06:52.212
You’re right,

06:52.946 --> 06:56.811
I am pretty and I am special.

07:06.258 --> 07:09.143
And  I am in the wrong office.

07:13.987 --> 07:16.480
Wow, that was a tough hour.

07:17.158 --> 07:18.570
Come on in girls.

07:20.448 --> 07:21.720
Have a seat.

07:21.866 --> 07:22.651
Excuse me.

07:24.927 --> 07:26.223
Hello ?

07:26.928 --> 07:29.541
Oh, hello Helen.

07:30.398 --> 07:33.363
Fine ! I’ll heat up my own dinner !

07:33.385 --> 07:37.853
God knows you haven’t heat up
anything in our home in months.

07:38.346 --> 07:40.350
Well, have a great time, eh ?

07:43.565 --> 07:48.222
So ! Donna, nice to see you again.

07:48.348 --> 07:49.492
How are your folks ?

07:49.568 --> 07:52.133
Well, uhm, still crazy.

07:52.745 --> 07:55.990
You’re telling me ! They paid for my watch.

07:57.855 --> 07:59.402
And you must be Jackie.

07:59.526 --> 08:00.462
Yeah,

08:00.557 --> 08:02.922
but before you think there is anything
wrong with me.

08:02.936 --> 08:07.060
You see, I’m only here because I like this
boy and I don’t wanna like him so...

08:07.146 --> 08:11.782
you know, if you could just write a prescription for that,
I’ll be on my way.

08:12.618 --> 08:15.562
Do you see how messed up she is ?

08:16.926 --> 08:19.522
Still eating your cuticles ?

08:22.927 --> 08:24.573
No.

08:25.758 --> 08:26.782
Jackie,

08:26.896 --> 08:31.180
first tell me about some of the other men
that you had feelings for.

08:32.034 --> 08:35.823
Okay, well, there is Mickael, who cheated on me. 

08:36.005 --> 08:40.972
And there is Steven who would rather vandalize a car
than committing to a relationship.

08:41.567 --> 08:42.823
And now there’s Fez.

08:42.966 --> 08:46.131
Who’s been after me for years and
who is really, really sweet,

08:46.235 --> 08:49.222
but I never paid any attention to him
'cause you know,

08:49.305 --> 08:51.342
he’s foreign.

08:52.485 --> 08:54.743
He seems like a fine man,

08:55.008 --> 08:57.030
or at least he is now...

08:57.377 --> 09:04.151
before you get you sadistic female claws into him
and make him forget that he’s even a man at all.

09:05.227 --> 09:09.703
Well, none of this matters anyway because
of course now that I like Fez,

09:09.765 --> 09:11.372
he  has a girlfriend.

09:12.528 --> 09:16.671
Have you ever considered that you
like unavailable men ?

09:16.855 --> 09:20.493
I mean, the others were emotionally unavailable

09:21.706 --> 09:25.502
but you weren’t interested in Fez until he was taken.

09:26.645 --> 09:27.530
Wow,

09:27.983 --> 09:33.339
so I don’t really like Fez, I just think I like Fez
because he has a girlfriend.

09:35.229 --> 09:38.095
Do you see how messed up she is, Doctor.

09:39.234 --> 09:41.501
I mean she's got some real issues.

09:42.429 --> 09:44.780
I noticed you died your hair.

09:45.496 --> 09:48.061
What are you running away from ?

09:48.656 --> 09:51.370
I just want people to like me !

09:51.885 --> 09:53.083
Jackie,

09:53.356 --> 09:56.030
just remember that whoever you end up with,

09:56.285 --> 09:58.211
the key to any relationship

09:58.355 --> 10:00.590
is good communication.

10:01.836 --> 10:03.312
Excuse me.

10:04.328 --> 10:05.723
Hello ?

10:07.416 --> 10:08.610
Helen,

10:08.907 --> 10:13.370
I told you I’d move it as soon as Al can help me.

10:13.807 --> 10:17.091
Well, I wish you had more upper body strength.

10:18.107 --> 10:19.970
No, you are.

10:20.276 --> 10:23.531
Noo, youu are.

10:24.286 --> 10:27.540
GO TO HELL YOU COW !

10:33.878 --> 10:36.900
So, yes,

10:37.698 --> 10:39.982
good communication !

10:41.206 --> 10:43.340
That’s the key.

10:55.898 --> 10:57.881
Why is the closed sign on the door ?

10:57.928 --> 10:59.342
Oh, Red put that up.

10:59.497 --> 11:04.552
He said I could either have a closed sign up
the door or an open sign on my ass.

11:09.457 --> 11:12.012
I should never have asked him to come down, man,
he’s bad for business.

11:12.665 --> 11:14.722
You think that’s bad for business,

11:14.805 --> 11:17.521
I’ve been stealing money for months !

11:20.167 --> 11:21.221
Red !

11:23.157 --> 11:24.452
Red !

11:25.497 --> 11:27.933
Hey, man, why are you working so hard ?

11:28.038 --> 11:29.782
You should be enjoying your retirement,
you know ?

11:29.906 --> 11:32.741
There’s still plenty to do here.

11:33.047 --> 11:38.301
The hinge on that door is busted. The window needs
caulking and that back room is such a mess,

11:38.337 --> 11:41.783
you got a bunch of weeds growing in there.

11:50.908 --> 11:55.342
Look, man. Why don’t you just call it today, you know ?
You’re retired, it’s 2 o’clock, hey !

11:55.408 --> 11:57.491
It’s almost dinner time !

12:00.545 --> 12:02.210
Are you kicking me out ?

12:02.398 --> 12:03.431
No !

12:03.618 --> 12:04.792
You know...

12:06.467 --> 12:08.290
Yeah !

12:08.927 --> 12:12.282
Look, wh, why don’t you just go home ?

12:13.048 --> 12:15.920
I don’t believe this.

12:19.545 --> 12:21.010
He seems mad.

12:21.277 --> 12:23.592
It’s a good thing you’ll never have
to see him again.

12:25.955 --> 12:27.683
Oh oh !

12:31.837 --> 12:37.203
Fez, great news ! I have an opportunity to do something
that’s gonna make me incredibly happy.

12:37.268 --> 12:39.272
- Oh, that’s wonderful !
- I’m gonna become a nun.

12:39.298 --> 12:41.221
YOU SELFISH WHORE !

12:43.385 --> 12:47.193
I’m joining the covent next week so I’m sorry,

12:47.425 --> 12:52.363
but if it makes you feel any better, you’re the
last man to ever touch me

12:52.447 --> 12:57.673
unless I meet someone in Italy before
I take my vows. See ya !

13:01.517 --> 13:03.872
Hey, Fez ! What’s going on ?

13:04.546 --> 13:06.013
Hillary broke up with me.

13:06.528 --> 13:07.980
Oh, my God.

13:09.386 --> 13:13.132
I just need someone to hold me and tell me it’s alright.

13:15.516 --> 13:18.481
I gotta go find Hyde.

13:27.167 --> 13:29.420
I am pretty.

13:30.016 --> 13:32.430
I am special.

13:33.105 --> 13:36.250
My casserole is not too oniony.

13:39.465 --> 13:40.811
Hey !

13:40.958 --> 13:44.003
Oh, Steven. I need to talk to you.

13:44.325 --> 13:46.542
How could you kick Red out of your store ?

13:46.727 --> 13:53.030
I wasn’t expecting him home so early and he walked
in on me taking a bath without any bubbles.

13:55.055 --> 13:57.590
There goes the mystery.

13:58.856 --> 14:01.231
Sorry Mrs. Forman, he was in the way.

14:01.697 --> 14:03.403
In the way ?

14:03.625 --> 14:08.462
When your parents left you and we took you in,
did we say you were in the way ? No !

14:08.616 --> 14:10.762
We fed you and loved you

14:10.867 --> 14:14.421
and we let you in to our Cirrus family portrait.

14:15.185 --> 14:16.503
Look,

14:16.915 --> 14:21.503
I asked him to fix one little switch, the next thing
I know he’s pouding and sweating and swearing.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.413
It’s like watching Fez eating a cake.

14:24.857 --> 14:28.511
Well, you need to find a way to make Red feel useful

14:28.827 --> 14:30.692
and you know what else you nee to find ?

14:30.877 --> 14:34.640
A beige cardigan ! Cause that’s what’s
we’re wearing in this year’s picture.

14:35.028 --> 14:41.863
And I don’t wanna hear about how it’s not cool I just wanna
you to put the damn thing on, smile and say FREAKING CHEESE !

14:46.808 --> 14:48.060
Jackie,

14:49.087 --> 14:51.983
what is it about me that makes everyone leave ?

14:52.927 --> 14:58.131
I’m going to die alone with nothing but a room full
of candy and pornography to keep me company.

14:59.917 --> 15:02.743
Although when I say that,
it sounds okay.

15:06.717 --> 15:11.633
Oh, okay. You’re not going to die alone.

15:12.068 --> 15:14.822
Yes, I am. I’m a foreign weirdo.

15:15.645 --> 15:20.071
No ! no, you, you have fascinating stories
about far away lands.

15:20.135 --> 15:22.671
I scare women away with my clingingness.

15:22.935 --> 15:25.921
But when someone needs you,
you’re always there.

15:26.277 --> 15:29.370
People barely understand a word I say.

15:30.147 --> 15:36.241
Well, yes. But that’s a good thing because
sometimes you say really stupid things.

15:37.326 --> 15:41.123
Okay, look Fez, you’re a great guy. Okay ?

15:41.715 --> 15:44.320
You’re funny and you’re cute

15:45.096 --> 15:47.510
and any girl would be lucky to have you.

15:48.265 --> 15:50.843
Oh, Jackie, you’re so sweet.

15:51.805 --> 15:54.751
Why can’t I find a woman like you who likes me ?

15:59.096 --> 16:00.961
I gotta go.

16:03.518 --> 16:06.213
Well, maybe if I watch some TV,
I’ll feel better.

16:07.516 --> 16:12.840
<i>And now Masterpiece presents
The Lonely Foreigner.</i>

16:24.186 --> 16:29.330
Hyde, I don’t get it. We’re going to destroy Mr Forman’s
house and that’s supposed to make him feel better ?

16:29.626 --> 16:31.081
Yeah !

16:32.125 --> 16:35.012
Then he can fix everything and feel very useful.

16:35.377 --> 16:39.152
Red would be happier than the time he chased
those dead heads off in the park.

16:40.297 --> 16:42.593
Well, you can’t camp there, man.

16:42.678 --> 16:45.743
Some bold guy chases you off.

16:51.128 --> 16:52.930
I just ripped that off the furnace.

16:53.177 --> 16:55.080
I busted the TV.

16:56.947 --> 17:00.472
I totally destroyed the washing machine, man !

17:06.098 --> 17:09.832
Oh, hey, Red. I’m glad you’re here man.
Things are just falling apart around here.

17:09.886 --> 17:12.251
It’s freezing in my room, the TV’s broken and...

17:13.265 --> 17:16.490
this thing just popped out the washing machine.

17:18.468 --> 17:21.613
Jeez, I’m gone for one day, the
whole house goes to hell !

17:21.968 --> 17:24.771
Yeah, it’s a good thing you’re here so
you can fix everything.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.113
You know what ?

17:27.357 --> 17:29.220
I’ll get to this stuff later.

17:29.637 --> 17:30.833
Later ?

17:31.078 --> 17:35.122
Yeah. I was thinking about what you said
this afternoon at the record store.

17:35.265 --> 17:40.372
You’re right. I do deserve to slow down
and enjoy my retirement. So,

17:40.676 --> 17:41.610
right now,

17:41.755 --> 17:43.952
I’m  going fishing.

17:44.095 --> 17:47.521
Yeah, but it’s like 10 degrees in my room.

17:48.345 --> 17:50.030
Can I at least call the repair-man ?

17:50.157 --> 17:51.271
Sure,

17:51.418 --> 17:53.173
but you’re paying for it.

17:53.518 --> 17:55.423
I’m on a fixed income.

17:56.036 --> 17:58.130
I’m retired.

18:03.045 --> 18:06.873
This is bad, we destroyed everything,

18:07.338 --> 18:08.803
on the bright side,

18:09.068 --> 18:11.062
I don’t live here.

18:12.245 --> 18:15.882
What I am gonna do, man. I can’t watch Tv,
I can’t sleep in my room.

18:16.268 --> 18:18.091
I guess I could drag my bed right here.

18:18.476 --> 18:19.791
Hyde, man.

18:19.997 --> 18:23.760
Wait to see what I did to your bed.

18:25.895 --> 18:27.910
Ok, Donna. I don’t know what to do.

18:28.028 --> 18:30.580
I thought I only liked Fez because
he was unavailable.

18:30.657 --> 18:32.140
But now he’s available

18:32.215 --> 18:34.131
and I still like him.

18:34.638 --> 18:36.773
I mean, I almost kissed him.

18:37.035 --> 18:39.112
On the mouth.

18:39.215 --> 18:42.081
He eats couscous with that thing.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.632
Okay, before I tell you what to do,
let me just get one thing straight.

18:47.318 --> 18:49.583
You really like Fez ?

18:49.798 --> 18:52.663
Fez is the one you like.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.123
Yes.

18:54.378 --> 18:57.361
So you wanna go out on dates with Fez.

18:57.726 --> 18:59.903
And make out with Fez.

19:01.188 --> 19:03.031
- Yes ! 
- Okay.

19:04.215 --> 19:07.493
- It’s Xmas morning and you get up and your gift is Fez.
- Donna !

19:07.687 --> 19:09.682
Sorry.

19:11.777 --> 19:14.453
Alright, well look. If you really like him,

19:14.638 --> 19:16.401
you’re gonna have to tell him.

19:17.448 --> 19:20.061
I know, you’re right.

19:21.435 --> 19:23.281
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:23.525 --> 19:25.452
Hey. So uh...

19:25.586 --> 19:27.652
I heard you liked Fez.

19:29.686 --> 19:31.310
WHAT  !?

19:31.647 --> 19:33.320
How did you hear that ?

19:33.477 --> 19:36.050
Since we weren’t trap in a soundproof lead box,

19:36.096 --> 19:39.412
we were able to hear your delicate voice
from across the street.

19:39.708 --> 19:42.740
Alright, okay, I know you guys probably
think I’m crazy

19:42.876 --> 19:44.940
and I’m going from guy to guy

19:45.088 --> 19:48.483
but Fez has always been there for me and he
makes me feel good about myself.

19:48.565 --> 19:51.393
So go ahead, go ahead make fun of me.

19:51.897 --> 19:55.303
No, I think that’s cool. You know,
Fez is a good guy.

19:55.677 --> 19:58.932
And I think if he makes you happy
that’s what you should do.

19:59.445 --> 20:01.942
Wow, Steven, thanks.

20:02.246 --> 20:04.093
And if it doesn't work out...

20:04.266 --> 20:06.452
I hear Bob’s available.

20:10.917 --> 20:13.902
And if that’s no good, here comes
the garbage man.

20:14.236 --> 20:18.563
Oh hey, there’s a guy across the
street you haven’t done.

20:22.886 --> 20:25.383
Oh hey Fez, we need to talk.

20:25.486 --> 20:28.493
Yes, we do. I thought about what you
said and you were right.

20:28.596 --> 20:30.040
- I was ?
- Yes.

20:30.165 --> 20:31.962
Hillary did me a big favor by leaving.

20:32.108 --> 20:34.783
Yes. Okay, I think so too.

20:34.888 --> 20:38.950
And what I realize is, I shouldn’t be
tied down to one woman.

20:39.877 --> 20:40.611
Wait, what ?

20:40.678 --> 20:44.291
Yes, I should be spreading my seeds all across the land.

20:45.328 --> 20:50.430
So, America, get ready, cause Fez is
coming out and no woman is safe.

20:51.205 --> 20:53.721
Except you. Nighty night.

21:05.105 --> 21:07.563
Don’t get me started on my home life.

21:07.798 --> 21:11.351
My wife and I haven’t slept together for months.

21:11.587 --> 21:14.281
But it’s not all good news.

21:15.817 --> 21:18.822
Oh, well, looks like our hour is almost up.

21:19.138 --> 21:22.622
But it seems like you could use a drink.

21:23.745 --> 21:25.290
Pour one for yourself.

21:25.445 --> 21:28.240
Oh, no I never touch this stuff.

21:28.876 --> 21:32.450
Oh, what the hell ? Doctor’s orders !
