13:52.999 --> 13:54.399
Bye, baby.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.972
[Zeke] Stay right here.
Be right back.

14:10.116 --> 14:13.284
Phew, sorry,
there's a dead mouse.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.986
[Cynthia] Ew.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.026
Hey, hey, hey, let's...
Why don't we...

14:22.028 --> 14:23.394
Sit in the front seat
this morning.

14:23.396 --> 14:27.198
[Cynthia] The front seat
is dangerous for kids.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.235
All right.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.637
Wouldn't do anything reckless.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.242
[indistinct police
radio chatter]

14:55.495 --> 14:58.329
Morning, ma'am. I got a call
from Dr. Richter.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.299
Whoo, boy. You're in
for an upsetting day,

15:01.301 --> 15:04.369
I tell you what.
I'll buzz him.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.915
Look, you know
I normally don't call y'all

15:16.917 --> 15:20.618
about minor shit,
but this... I just...

15:20.620 --> 15:22.453
[Spenser] This is a big deal.
I get it.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.222
[Dr. Richter] This dude
suffered, Spense.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.925
And I don't think this
could have happened to him

15:26.927 --> 15:28.159
without the assistance of, uh,

15:28.161 --> 15:29.694
-a second party.
-Well, what happened?

15:29.696 --> 15:32.597
[Dr. Richter] Well, severe
peritonitis of the colon,

15:32.599 --> 15:33.431
for starters.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.099
We didn't even realize
he was dealing with that

15:35.101 --> 15:37.402
till he started bleeding
all over the damn gurney.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.269
[Spenser] Lord.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.671
That's not even
what did him in.

15:39.673 --> 15:41.539
Here's what did him in,

15:41.541 --> 15:43.541
rectal hemorrhaging.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.510
Rectal hemorrhaging.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.445
I saved a dude one time,

15:47.447 --> 15:49.414
couple towns over
off Highway 11.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.949
Thought his wife
was going to leave him,

15:50.951 --> 15:53.017
so he went in the kitchen
under the sink,

15:53.019 --> 15:55.520
poured him up one of them
suicide margaritas.

15:55.522 --> 15:59.457
Drank it down. They got him
to me just in time.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.425
By the time I got him,

16:00.427 --> 16:04.095
the Drano had eaten
half way though his throat.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.463
But we saved him.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.699
Saved his ass.
He's back with his wife.

16:07.701 --> 16:10.168
They got two kids.
They're doing well.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.569
He works at the garden center.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.171
[Spenser] Over by
the Ruby Tuesday?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.973
[Dr. Richter]
Yeah, that's the one.

16:14.975 --> 16:15.974
The point is this,

16:15.976 --> 16:18.476
you hemorrhaging here.
I can save you.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.745
You hemorrhaging back here,

16:20.747 --> 16:23.414
it's a whole another
ball game.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.317
Where are you going with this?

16:27.053 --> 16:29.387
[Dr. Richter] Here's
the weird thing, Spense.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.388
Several cranial contusions

16:30.390 --> 16:33.157
that aren't even consistent
with the rectal hemorrhaging.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.093
What the hell is that?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.194
Blunt force trauma.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.096
Exactly, which leads me
to believe,

16:38.098 --> 16:42.567
like due to the nature
of his injuries or...

16:42.569 --> 16:43.468
I mean, I don't know.

16:43.470 --> 16:47.605
I just think this guy was
a victim of a sexual assault.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.541
We haven't even finished
the autopsy yet,

16:50.543 --> 16:53.544
but we've already found
traces of semen.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.081
In the colon.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.319
Lord.

17:01.321 --> 17:05.022
We've got some real perverts
on the loose.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.689

17:38.691 --> 17:40.491

-Hey.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.692
-How's it goin'?
-Pretty good.

17:41.694 --> 17:45.263
[Dudley] I wanna get
some of them scratchers.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.439
[Zeke] Oh, my God.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.108
[flies buzzing]

17:57.177 --> 18:00.478
Get a number eight
and two number sixes.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.712
[Cashier]
Somebody's tryin' to win.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.816
Oh, and a four.
Eh, you never know.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.818
Um, excuse me? Police lady?

18:06.820 --> 18:10.788
-[Dudley] Yeah?
-My dad found a wallet.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.300

18:22.302 --> 18:24.869
-[Dudley] This your father?
-[Cynthia] Yup.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.204
-Hey, there!
-Hi.

18:26.206 --> 18:29.207
Uh, daughter tells me
you found a missing wallet.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.676
Oh, it's not missing anymore!
[laughs]

18:31.678 --> 18:33.177
-[Dudley] Yeah.
-[Cynthia] Ow.

18:33.179 --> 18:37.648
I thought I should take it to
the police, uh, here you are!

18:37.650 --> 18:39.450
[chuckles] Yeah.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.686
Thank you, Cynthia!

18:42.489 --> 18:43.754
I got it right here.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.357
-[door opens]
-[bell rings]

18:47.594 --> 18:50.528
Hey, Duds,
everything all right in here?

18:50.530 --> 18:53.564
Yup, just got a, uh,
missing wallet.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.700
Okay. I'm gonna
get some cupcakes.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.535
Oh. Awesome.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.611
Well, take it easy.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.146
Bye.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.215
You're welcome.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.551
[bell rings]

19:22.495 --> 19:24.662
You're not going to get fired
for an emergency, dude!

19:24.664 --> 19:26.731
[Earl on phone] <i> Dude, I can't</i>
<i> tell 'em it's an emergency.</i>

19:26.733 --> 19:28.733
<i> We told 'em that last month</i>
<i> when we saw Papa Roach.</i>

19:28.735 --> 19:30.635
Rick's still pissed
about that shit apparently.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.237
Oh, also, you seen his
new fuckin' glasses there

19:33.239 --> 19:34.405
<i> made out of wood or some shit.</i>

the "S" has hit the fan, okay?

19:42.382 --> 19:44.782
<i> -What?</i>
-The "S."

19:44.784 --> 19:45.616
The "S."

19:45.618 --> 19:48.719
<i> I don't know</i>
<i> what you're spelling, dude.</i>

19:48.721 --> 19:51.322
The fuckin' "S," man!

19:52.258 --> 19:53.457
What?

19:53.459 --> 19:55.693
Just come over ASAP.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.195
All right, baby...

19:57.197 --> 19:59.397
-[Earl] <i> Me?</i>
-Sweetheart.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.333
Did you just call me
sweetheart?

20:04.537 --> 20:05.870
Awesome.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.407
What's the emergency?

20:10.877 --> 20:13.578
Why did you say ASAP?

20:17.817 --> 20:20.952
[rock song playing

20:57.490 --> 20:59.290
[clicks tongue]

21:04.864 --> 21:05.696
How're you doing?

21:05.698 --> 21:09.433
Question is,
is how you're doin'?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.369
Oh, I'm doin' just fine.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.671
Hmm. Honeymoon period.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.673
[laughs] Guess so.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.976
Uh, Ted Bolton's
on his honeymoon.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.879
The real kind.
The wedding kind.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.015
Ted? I thought
his name was Ed.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.850
Oh, Ted is short for Edward.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.485
Oh, thought it was
short for Theodore.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.553
Listen, Duds, whatever
the hell his name is,

21:29.555 --> 21:32.957
I'm gonna need some
assistance with this

21:32.959 --> 21:37.061
homicide bullshit
till Bolton gets back.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.399
Are you serious?

21:41.734 --> 21:43.734
-Mmm-hmm.
-Thank...

Thank you, ma'am.

I'm not askin' you
to crack a case now.

21:47.307 --> 21:53.811
I'm just askin' you to type up
some shit and keep a file.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.780
Well, irregardless, I...

21:55.782 --> 21:58.749
I appreciate it, ma'am.
I won't let you down.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.952
I just gotta drop
off this, uh...

Where in the world...

22:06.993 --> 22:08.526

-Yeah.

Oh, there's a credit card.
Richard Long.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.039
And I'll get right with you

22:22.041 --> 22:24.942

homicide craziness.

Great.

piano recital Saturday.

You gettin' good?

22:42.028 --> 22:44.662
Will you play for me later?

22:44.664 --> 22:46.130
If you want.

-Yo, I got fired.
-[Zeke] What?

23:11.491 --> 23:13.891
Psych! I ain't fuckin' fired.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.060
What's going on?

23:17.530 --> 23:19.397
Fuckin' gullible.

23:19.599 --> 23:20.865
-Oh, hell no.
-[Zeke] Yeah.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.534
There's Dick blood
all over my fuckin' backseat!

23:23.536 --> 23:24.735
Why didn't you cover it up?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.470
I tried to, dude.

23:26.472 --> 23:28.139
It's fuckin' bled
right through.

23:28.141 --> 23:31.809
[Earl] No shit.
That romper is fucked up.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.878
Put it on Deluxe.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.546
I haven't got Deluxe.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.447
Okay, what've you got?

23:36.449 --> 23:38.649
Light soil, medium soil,
and heavy soil.

23:38.651 --> 23:39.650
Put that shit on heavy soil.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.819
Duh... I've already
got it on heavy soil.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.621
Great, solved.

carried away last night.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.835
[Zeke] Yeah.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.804
You heard from Dick at all?

23:59.806 --> 24:01.572
Mmm-mmm. You neither?

24:01.574 --> 24:03.007
[Earl] Uh-uh

24:07.580 --> 24:09.747
I handed his wallet
off to a cop.

24:09.749 --> 24:12.616
Yeah, right,
that would be stupid.

24:13.619 --> 24:14.852
You serious?

24:14.854 --> 24:15.953
Why would you do that?

24:15.955 --> 24:17.555
'Cause she asked me
for it, man.

Where'd you even see
a fuckin' cop?

24:20.560 --> 24:24.094

When the shit hit the fan!

24:24.096 --> 24:26.697
That's what
you were talking about.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.499
All right, great.

24:28.501 --> 24:31.101
I'm gonna need you to take
Cyn to school, dude.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.704
I'm gonna take... Why would
I take Cyn to school?

24:33.706 --> 24:35.139
[taps car]

24:37.743 --> 24:39.243
Yeah, okay. I'll take her.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.612
[Zeke] I'm gonna try and get
this shit wiped down

24:41.614 --> 24:42.646
while you're out.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.249
See, dude, this is exactly why
I said we should leave town.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.584
Everything's gonna be fine.

24:46.586 --> 24:49.720
If we just get the car clean,
we're gonna be fine.

It's Lydia.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.597

fuckin' answer it.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.568

25:11.744 --> 25:13.644
<i> Yeah, I'm fine. What's up?</i>

25:13.646 --> 25:15.613
Did you hear

26:02.328 --> 26:04.962
in the middle
of the afternoon, baby?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.599
<i> Fine.</i>

26:10.636 --> 26:12.169
[Earl] Murderer?

26:12.305 --> 26:13.304
Who the fuck's a murderer?

26:13.306 --> 26:14.738
[shouts]
We're the fucking murd...

26:14.740 --> 26:16.674
I didn't get to play you
my piano.

26:16.676 --> 26:19.310
You can play it for me
when you get home.

26:19.845 --> 26:22.580
Oh, Christ, it's not like
I don't wanna hear it.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.683
I'll be looking forward to it
all day.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.152
Pacing and everything,

26:28.154 --> 26:30.020
thinking about
how amazing you'll be.

26:30.022 --> 26:33.824
But you gotta get ready
for school, so go get dressed.

26:36.329 --> 26:38.329
[sighs]

26:55.982 --> 26:57.815
[sighs]

27:03.990 --> 27:06.023
[lights matchstick]

27:29.682 --> 27:31.715
[shouts] Fuck!

27:54.340 --> 27:56.807
[Cynthia] Earl,
did you break your chair?

27:56.809 --> 27:59.910
[Earl] Yeah,
don't worry about it.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.856
You can't smoke here.

28:12.858 --> 28:13.991
It's vape. Got it.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.326
All right, whatever.
Let's go.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.696
[Mrs. Bennett]
Good morning, Cynthia.

28:18.698 --> 28:19.897
[Earl] What's up? Zeke's dad,

28:19.899 --> 28:23.967
uh, not Zeke,
Cynthia's dad is like,

28:23.969 --> 28:25.169
his car's all janky right now,

28:25.171 --> 28:27.438
so like, I'm just like
signing in for her.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.941
Or I don't know, official
whatever, okay, tight.

28:31.210 --> 28:34.111
Thought that was you,
Earl Wyeth.

28:34.714 --> 28:35.913
What's up, Jane?

28:35.915 --> 28:37.347
Hello, Mrs. Long.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.917
How are you
this morning, Cynthia?

28:39.919 --> 28:41.318
[Cynthia] I'm okay.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.420
It was a crazy morning.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.189
Oh, I hope everything's okay.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.191
It's chill. It's like
Zeke's car is just

28:47.193 --> 28:49.226
acting up a little bit,
so it's like...

28:49.228 --> 28:51.328
You know what I'm sayin'?
[stammers] It's not...

28:51.330 --> 28:52.930
It's not crazy. [scoffs]

28:52.932 --> 28:53.897
You're all set, sweetie!

28:53.899 --> 28:57.401
Bye, Mrs. Bennett,
bye, Mrs. Long, bye, Earl.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.269
Bye, Cyn, have a good day.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.771
Earl.

29:01.107 --> 29:01.839
Earl,

29:01.841 --> 29:04.341
can I talk to you for just
a second about some things?

29:04.343 --> 29:05.442
Uh, I mean I would typically,

29:05.444 --> 29:07.211
but like, I gotta...
I gotta roll,

29:07.213 --> 29:09.413
you know what I'm sayin, like?

29:10.216 --> 29:11.014
[sighs]

29:11.016 --> 29:12.382
I guess we can talk
for a second.

29:12.384 --> 29:15.486
[Jane] Thank you very much.
Let's go outside.

29:15.755 --> 29:18.388
Oh, this is your... Flower.

29:19.525 --> 29:22.493
[Jane] <i> Now, I don't mean to</i>
<i> put you in a funny position.</i>

29:22.495 --> 29:23.861
I ain't... No, I ain't...

29:23.863 --> 29:26.396
I'm not in a funny position.
It's cool.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.766
All right. [exhales]

29:28.768 --> 29:31.502
You were with Dick
last night. Yeah?

29:31.504 --> 29:33.971
Yeah. I mean, for like...
I mean, not really.

29:33.973 --> 29:34.972
I mean, yeah, but like,

29:34.974 --> 29:37.341
just for like...
For a little while.
Like I left early, so...

29:37.343 --> 29:41.178
I mean, I don't know what...
I mean, like why?

29:43.382 --> 29:45.883
I didn't see him this morning.

29:46.852 --> 29:48.485
He didn't come home.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.121
I mean, like, I don't know.
Like basically,

29:51.123 --> 29:53.423
he said he had
like a meeting.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.526
Like an early meeting.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.262
A meeting?

29:58.464 --> 30:01.965
Since when does Dick
have meetings?

30:02.034 --> 30:02.833
I don't know.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.168
Whatever,
all right, you got me.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.836
You hiding something from me?

30:05.838 --> 30:07.805
I'm not hiding anything.
What would I hide?

30:07.807 --> 30:09.940
Is he fooling around on me?

30:09.942 --> 30:11.975
Pfft. No.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.413
No, ma'am.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.383
You better not be lying to me.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.150
I'm not lying.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.820
If he was fooling around
on you, you'd know it.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.388
I feel like he is.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.522
He's always sneaking around

30:25.524 --> 30:29.359
and coming home way too late
for just band practice.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.562
What's it y'all even do?

30:32.064 --> 30:33.130
[Earl] This some, like...

30:33.132 --> 30:34.298
This is like some
personal shit

30:34.300 --> 30:37.301
you guys got to talk about
with each other.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.970
Know what I'm saying?

30:40.573 --> 30:42.172
[Jane] Yeah.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.376
Fair enough.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.215
You see my husband,
you'd better warn him

30:51.217 --> 30:53.116
before he comes home.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.253
Okay. I'll do that.

30:59.191 --> 31:02.059
Have a nice day, Jane. Cool.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.261
[Jane] All right.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.344
[scrubbing]

31:27.920 --> 31:29.419
[Earl] Oh, shit.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.455
[Zeke] Grab a rag, dude.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.157
[Earl] I ran into Jane.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.193
-And?
-She's looking for Dick.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.361
Not like dick, but you know...

31:37.363 --> 31:38.362
What'd you say to her, man?

31:38.364 --> 31:39.897
I don't know.
What I could tell her.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.131
I told her I hadn't seen him.

31:41.133 --> 31:44.034
[Zeke] Oh, fuck, man! Fuck!

31:44.036 --> 31:45.335
[Earl] Don't get excited, man.

31:45.337 --> 31:46.570
Just let us clean the car.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.238
Ain't sayin' we're implicated
in nothin'.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.941
Just clean the car
and we'll be straight.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.443
[Zeke] All right.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.146
[Earl] What'd they do
in <i> Pulp Fiction?</i>

31:56.148 --> 31:58.682
-[Zeke] Call Anthony Kiedis.
-[Earl] Ah, you're thinkin'
of Harvey Keitel.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.517
Anthony Kiedis is the dude
from Red Hot Chili Peppers.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.653
[Zeke] Will you shut
the fuck up? I'm really
fucking stressed out now.

32:02.655 --> 32:05.422
-[Earl] I was telling you
who Anthony Kiedis...
-[Zeke] Rub the seat, dude.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.456
[Earl] This shit is nasty.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.625
[scrubbing continues]

32:11.463 --> 32:12.462
What's this?

32:12.464 --> 32:16.300
That's Haley. He's Cynthia's.
You can leave it.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.170
[clicks tongue]

32:23.943 --> 32:25.142
Know what, dude?

32:25.144 --> 32:26.510
Even if we got this
totally cleaned out,

32:26.512 --> 32:29.513
they still got ways
to test for DNA.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.615
Fuck, fuck.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.351
What are we gonna do?

32:41.060 --> 32:45.595
I mean, we could just
tell 'em it was stolen.

32:55.107 --> 32:57.674
[Dudley] Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.412
Huh...

33:05.684 --> 33:07.217
Odd.

33:14.526 --> 33:18.028
DNA results
came back negative.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.030
[Spenser] There's no DNA?

33:20.032 --> 33:23.333
Inconclusive!
I mean, inconclusive.

33:23.535 --> 33:27.004
How could DNA be inconclusive?

33:27.139 --> 33:27.771
Um...

33:27.773 --> 33:29.106
-I don't know.
-[sighs]

33:29.108 --> 33:33.643
Anything on those assholes
that dropped off Mr. Doe yet?

33:33.645 --> 33:36.046
[Dudley] No, ma'am. Not yet.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.314
[clicks tongue]

33:37.316 --> 33:38.548
I spoke
with the missus earlier.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.752
Said she's gonna make me
a quiche for when I get home.

33:41.754 --> 33:45.555
She's super excited
I'm on this case. So...

33:46.692 --> 33:50.260
[clears throat] Anything on
John Doe himself?

33:50.329 --> 33:53.397
Any missing person's report?

33:53.766 --> 33:55.499
Do we have anything?

33:55.501 --> 33:58.368
I mean, I can keep digging,

33:58.370 --> 34:00.704
but seems like the best we can
hope for right now is, uh,

34:00.706 --> 34:04.241
something just falls
into our laps.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.210
Hmm.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.379
Hmm.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.049
-Okay.
-Okay.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.126
[Zeke] Push.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.773
[Earl] Well, dang.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.677
That sucks.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.318
I guess we should have
checked the depth first.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.388
Are you gonna help me,
or are you gonna go to jail?

34:51.389 --> 34:52.722
[grunts]

34:54.426 --> 34:55.792
Fuck!

34:58.797 --> 34:59.529
Fuck!

34:59.531 --> 35:00.730
Hold up.
Let me put my shit down.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.200
Try not to get my phone wet.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.437
[Zeke coughs]

35:07.506 --> 35:11.208
-Yo, give me your hand.
-Just reach forward.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.678
-Can you reach?
-Fuck, dude.

35:15.280 --> 35:19.249
Do that shit on purpose?
Tryin' to help you...

35:22.821 --> 35:24.788
Why are you being a dick hole?

35:26.325 --> 35:31.161
Ow! [screams] Fuck!

35:31.363 --> 35:33.663
Stop it, dude.
I'm fuckin' bleeding.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.633
[scoffs] Yeah.
That's what's up.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.268
Sorry.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.669
[spits]

35:39.738 --> 35:43.240
Fuck, dude. I think you
made me chip my tooth.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.441
No. Seriously?

35:44.443 --> 35:45.842
Not sure?

35:46.145 --> 35:47.611
Right here.

35:49.648 --> 35:50.580
In the front?

35:50.582 --> 35:53.183
Naw, that's a bridge.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.653
A little...
It's a little rough.

35:56.655 --> 36:00.190
-Yeah. Right?
-Yeah.

36:15.574 --> 36:19.342
-[clatters]
-[dogs barking]

36:37.196 --> 36:39.829
[muffled rock music playing]

36:52.811 --> 36:54.844
[urinating]

37:01.220 --> 37:02.886
[music stops]

37:12.831 --> 37:14.431
[Earl] Yo...

37:14.633 --> 37:15.565
How's Comet?

37:15.567 --> 37:18.668
I dunno, I got to get back
over to the house.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.403
[door opens]

37:21.406 --> 37:25.442
Oh, God... Jesus Christ!

37:25.510 --> 37:29.613
Sorry, I thought
you'd be gone by now, Earl.

37:29.615 --> 37:30.947
[Earl] No, it's cool.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.515
Gone?

37:32.584 --> 37:34.751
[Lake] Yeah. Hey, Zeke.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.554
Sorry to have startled, y'all.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.923
Just comin' in
to feed the animals.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.591
Where you goin'?

37:41.660 --> 37:42.626
Nowhere. Just whatever.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.928
[Lake] Wait,
are you staying now?

37:47.866 --> 37:50.767
I already helped you out.
So, like...

37:52.437 --> 37:54.271
I gotta go, dude.

37:56.475 --> 37:57.907
All right.

37:59.011 --> 38:00.543
Well...

38:01.446 --> 38:04.047
Thanks for your help, buddy.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.754
Are y'all breakin' up
or somethin'?

38:10.756 --> 38:13.923
[Zeke] Naw, I just...
I gotta...

38:13.925 --> 38:15.825
Wife's waiting on me.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.497
And I gotta walk.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.969
Lemme get them short...
Fuck it.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.937
I'll get those shorts later.

38:28.974 --> 38:32.542
What, did y'all knock over
a bank? [chuckles]

38:33.912 --> 38:36.313
I want some money!

38:38.550 --> 38:42.085
-You want a beer or somethin'?
-All right, yeah.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.591
[door opens]

38:49.895 --> 38:51.461
Where've you been?

38:51.463 --> 38:53.330
[Zeke] Up at Earl's.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.867
Dick left his
driver's license.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.502
[Zeke] Oh.

39:01.506 --> 39:05.375
You know, I just can't believe
what happened last night.

39:05.377 --> 39:06.009
[stammers]

39:06.011 --> 39:07.777
You think you live
in a safe place,

39:07.779 --> 39:09.446
but it's just everywhere,
you know?

39:09.448 --> 39:11.514
There's this dark,
fucked-up-ness everywhere.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.550
You think you can
get away from, but...

39:13.552 --> 39:13.983
Lyds?

39:13.985 --> 39:15.952
No, I'm sorry, I won't go
on and on about it.

39:15.954 --> 39:16.686
It's just...

39:16.688 --> 39:20.590
-It's just unsettling is all.
-Yeah, I know.

39:21.727 --> 39:25.028
I just gotta...
I gotta tell you something.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.665
Okay.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.868
I think, um...

39:32.804 --> 39:35.572
[stammers] Did, uh... Did...

39:36.007 --> 39:39.376
What's the problem, Zeke?

39:41.480 --> 39:44.814
-You're so fucking hot.
-[laughs]

39:44.983 --> 39:46.783
Thank you.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.391
Car got stolen.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.159
[chuckles] What?

39:56.161 --> 39:59.963
Yeah, the car got stolen
last night.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.066
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

40:03.769 --> 40:06.836
What did you take Cynthia
to school in this morning?

40:06.838 --> 40:08.638
Earl drove her.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.508
-So...
-What? Who stole it?

40:11.510 --> 40:12.642
I don't...

40:12.644 --> 40:14.677
-Holy shit.
-Yeah

40:15.981 --> 40:19.649
The car got stolen?

40:21.887 --> 40:24.921
Why are... [stammers]
Why didn't you tell me?

40:24.923 --> 40:26.189
Well, I just did.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.091
I didn't want to scare you,
you know.

40:28.093 --> 40:31.461
Did you...
Did you call the police?

40:31.797 --> 40:34.464
No. Not yet. I'm...

40:34.800 --> 40:35.765
-Yeah.
-Not yet?

40:35.767 --> 40:37.000
Zeke, you've been home
all day!

40:37.002 --> 40:38.668
-What have you been doing?
-Yeah. I've been.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.103
Hasn't been that long
probably.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.838
No, it's fine.
[stammers] I'll call 'em.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.908
Oh, Lyds. Calm down.
Come on. Lydia.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.042
L-L-L-L-Lydia.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.110
Have you gone crazy?

40:47.112 --> 40:49.078
Well, maybe it's just gonna
show back up, you know.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.048
-Holy shit.
-We'll just deal with it here.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.817
-What?
-Zeke, this is...

40:53.819 --> 40:56.653
This has something to do
with the... The murders.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.755
Oh, baby, don't worry
about that.

40:58.757 --> 41:00.190
Don't worry about that,
come on.

41:00.192 --> 41:02.759
I thought I heard it
driving away last night.

41:02.761 --> 41:05.128
-Yeah, that might've been...
-I heard it being stolen

41:05.130 --> 41:07.664
-and I didn't do a damn thing!
-No, baby, don't do that.

41:07.666 --> 41:08.865
-You...
-Good God!

41:08.867 --> 41:10.500
...left me here alone
last night

41:10.502 --> 41:13.236
to get robbed by rapists
and murderers!

41:13.238 --> 41:14.971
-Where the hell were you?
-I'm sorry, baby.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.974
I didn't know somebody was
gonna come steal the car.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.008
I'm calling the cops.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.177
Why? What if we just
wait a little while?

41:21.179 --> 41:21.878
Zeke!

41:21.880 --> 41:23.780
I could have been raped
and murdered last night,

41:23.782 --> 41:26.583
your daughter could have been.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.718
And you didn't call
the fucking police

41:28.720 --> 41:29.752
for Christ's sakes!

41:29.754 --> 41:32.021
What's wrong with you?
Do you even care?

41:32.023 --> 41:34.858
I do care. I care.
I care a ton.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.894
Then why haven't you
called the police?

41:37.963 --> 41:39.729
I don't know.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.166
[knocking on door]

41:43.168 --> 41:45.869
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am,
but guess what.

41:45.871 --> 41:46.936
[Spenser] What?

41:46.938 --> 41:51.207
Oh, um, got something
that could be helpful

41:51.209 --> 41:53.610
for y'all's rape
and murder deal.

41:53.612 --> 41:59.015
A Mrs. Lydia Olsen, uh, came
and reported a stolen car.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.751
[Dudley] And guess
where she lives.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.219
Where?

42:03.788 --> 42:07.690
Uh, she lives on Highway 16.

42:09.761 --> 42:10.693
Hmm.

42:10.695 --> 42:13.029
That's by St. Germain.

42:13.732 --> 42:17.967
Well, you oughta
come out with me, Dudley,

42:17.969 --> 42:22.805
since you're gettin' a quiche
for bein' on the case.

42:23.108 --> 42:25.074
[laughing]

42:25.076 --> 42:27.844
[TV playing indistinctly]

42:28.580 --> 42:29.979
[doorbell rings]

42:29.981 --> 42:32.315
[Lydia] Zeke,
that's the police.

42:32.317 --> 42:33.016
Police?

42:33.018 --> 42:34.250
There's nothing
to worry about, baby.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.753
You just watch your program.
Okay?

42:40.892 --> 42:42.859
[Dudley] Well, hey, there!

42:43.562 --> 42:45.028
[Zeke] Huh?

42:49.768 --> 42:52.869
-We meet again.
-Mr. Olsen?

42:53.104 --> 42:54.971
No. Yes... Yes.

42:54.973 --> 42:56.839
-Come on in, Officers.
-[Dudley] Oh.

42:56.841 --> 42:59.642
My wife is in the kitchen.
She called you.

42:59.644 --> 43:02.845
[Dudley] This is a funny
little coincidence?

43:02.948 --> 43:04.581
Hilarious.

43:06.084 --> 43:08.084
[Cynthia] Is this about
the wallet?

43:08.086 --> 43:10.186
No, ma'am.
It's about your car.

43:10.188 --> 43:12.088
[Zeke] Right this way.

43:12.991 --> 43:14.857
Told you, baby, there's
nothing to worry about,

43:14.859 --> 43:17.694
all right?
Just watch your program.

43:25.036 --> 43:26.769
Skoochie.

43:27.138 --> 43:30.340
Is there anything
we can get y'all?

43:30.909 --> 43:32.775
Some black coffee'd be nice.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.611
[Zeke] Sure. Mmm-hmm.

43:38.850 --> 43:43.686
[Spenser] Okay. So let's, uh,
start at the beginning.

43:43.688 --> 43:45.655
It was stolen last night?

43:45.657 --> 43:46.689
[Lydia] Yes, ma'am.

43:46.691 --> 43:48.625
And you were both here?

43:48.627 --> 43:49.826
Uh, no, ma'am. Just me.

43:49.828 --> 43:51.995
[Zeke] Just my wife Lydia.

43:52.063 --> 43:53.763
All right.

43:54.265 --> 43:55.365
What happened?

43:55.367 --> 43:58.334
Uh, well,
Zeke was off at the bar.

43:58.336 --> 44:01.304
And my daughter Cynthia,
and I were here.

44:01.306 --> 44:06.175
I'd... I'd put her down
and gone to bed myself.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.044
And, Zeke was...

44:08.113 --> 44:09.779
Wait at... When did you
get home last night?

44:09.781 --> 44:13.383
Uh. I don't know,
4:00 or 5:00 or something.

44:13.385 --> 44:15.952
Which bar is open that late?

44:16.021 --> 44:18.187
Not tryin' to get
anybody in trouble.

44:18.189 --> 44:19.989
Nobody is in trouble yet.

44:19.991 --> 44:23.359
Except the folks
that stole your car.

44:23.428 --> 44:24.427
And the murderer.

44:24.429 --> 44:25.395
Uh... [clears throat]

44:25.397 --> 44:30.700
So, uh, ma'am.
Exactly what did you hear?

44:30.702 --> 44:34.437
Uh, well, I heard it
peeling off last night,

44:34.439 --> 44:36.839
like really fast.
Like peeling out.

44:36.841 --> 44:41.444
Um, and I figured it was Zeke
going off to do some donuts.

44:41.446 --> 44:42.311
Naw.

44:42.313 --> 44:44.313
So, you figure
those were the...

44:44.315 --> 44:46.215
Those were,
those were the thieves.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.216
-Yeah.
-Okay.

44:47.218 --> 44:50.386
Any idea why
they took that car?

44:50.388 --> 44:52.955
[sighs] It's the good one.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.791
So you do have another car.

44:54.793 --> 44:57.360
Yes, ma'am, It's the one
I took to work this morning.

44:57.362 --> 45:00.329
And the one you had
at the gas station?

45:01.132 --> 45:02.331
Yeah.

45:02.333 --> 45:03.132
What?

45:03.134 --> 45:05.401
Yeah. I had...
I had it this morning.

45:05.403 --> 45:07.103
[Spenser] Excuse me?

45:07.105 --> 45:09.072
I mean, Earl's car.
I had...

45:09.074 --> 45:11.240
I had my friend Earl's car
this morning.

45:11.242 --> 45:14.077
I'm sorry,
I just need a little coffee.

45:15.346 --> 45:16.245
[clears throat]

45:16.247 --> 45:18.281
-[Lydia] What are you doing?
-Hot. Hot, hot, hot

45:18.283 --> 45:21.918
I'm sorry. I'm okay. But...

45:22.887 --> 45:23.953
You know what I realized?

45:23.955 --> 45:25.088
I need to cancel
band practice.

45:25.090 --> 45:26.923
[Lydia] But this is
an odd time to do that.

45:26.925 --> 45:28.458
[Zeke] I know, baby,
but I don't want

45:28.460 --> 45:29.392
everyone showing up

45:29.394 --> 45:30.860
when we're trying to talk
to the cops...

45:30.862 --> 45:33.796
Police officers.
Police officers.

45:34.099 --> 45:37.100
Well, tell Dick
he left his driver's license.

45:37.102 --> 45:38.835
[Zeke] Right!

45:38.837 --> 45:39.469
[door closes]

45:39.471 --> 45:44.273
[Lydia] I'm sorry. He can be
such a spaz sometimes.

45:49.247 --> 45:52.348
-[laughing]
-I'd get fired for that.

45:52.984 --> 45:53.783
So stupid.

45:53.785 --> 45:57.120
It's a shame you're leavin'
town, Earl Wyeth.

45:58.323 --> 45:59.455
Uh, yeah.

45:59.457 --> 46:01.524
[cell phone ringing]

46:01.526 --> 46:03.860
Oh, fuck.
I got to get this one.

46:03.862 --> 46:06.496
-Family stuff?
-Uh, yup.

46:10.869 --> 46:11.534
Wassup? What?

46:11.536 --> 46:14.871
Holy fucking shit, dude.
The cops are here.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.072
<i> Are you serious?</i>

46:16.074 --> 46:18.274
Yeah. I'm panicking, dude.

46:18.276 --> 46:19.275
<i> What do they want?</i>

46:19.277 --> 46:20.243
Lydia called the cops

46:20.245 --> 46:21.878
after I gave her that
stolen car bit.

46:21.880 --> 46:22.879
[clicks tongue and sighs]

46:22.881 --> 46:23.946
Yeah. I guess we didn't

46:23.948 --> 46:25.081
totally think
that one through.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.516
Yeah, I think they think
my car going missing

46:26.518 --> 46:28.551
has something to do
with the murders.

46:28.553 --> 46:31.287
Hold up, murders?
Like plural?

46:31.289 --> 46:32.855
You know what I mean, dude.

46:32.857 --> 46:33.790
I don't know what to do.

46:33.792 --> 46:34.991
I feel like I should
just come clean.

46:34.993 --> 46:36.459
<i> Fuck that noise, dude!</i>
<i> Hell, no.</i>

46:36.461 --> 46:38.161
<i> Just look... Just stick</i>
<i> to your guns, dude.</i>

46:38.163 --> 46:41.264
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

46:41.266 --> 46:44.033
<i> Look, just chill out, dog.</i>
<i> It's all good.</i>

46:44.035 --> 46:46.269
<i> Just like,</i>
<i> stick to your story, dude.</i>

46:46.271 --> 46:48.204
They see right through me,
dude.

46:48.206 --> 46:49.238
I'm a horrible bluffer.

46:49.240 --> 46:53.509
No way, dude, you're like,
an awesome bluffer.

46:54.412 --> 46:58.047
Like, do you wanna go to jail?
You know what I'm sayin'.

46:58.049 --> 47:00.550
<i> Look, just bluff until</i>
<i> your asshole blows out.</i>

47:00.552 --> 47:03.186
-Okay.
<i> -Look, it's all on you.</i>

47:03.188 --> 47:04.821
<i> Just don't fuck it up.</i>

47:04.823 --> 47:06.322
[phone beeps]

47:14.365 --> 47:16.265
[grunts softly]

47:45.063 --> 47:46.629
[breathing heavily]

47:46.631 --> 47:48.397
Oh, fuck.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.333
What the fuck?

47:50.401 --> 47:52.201
What the fuck?

47:52.270 --> 47:55.037
Oh, shit. [sobbing]

48:04.148 --> 48:07.950
[Spenser] We're really not at
liberty to discuss any ongoing

48:07.952 --> 48:12.221
-criminal investigations.
-Oh, no. I understand it's...

48:12.223 --> 48:14.123
[Spenser] But I wouldn't worry.

48:14.125 --> 48:18.027
Nobody is gonna bother your
family anymore probably.

So, Mr. Olsen,

uh, I think
we're all set here now.

48:44.923 --> 48:45.988
Oh, we've gotta run.

48:45.990 --> 48:49.058
Oh, no! I missed all the fun.

48:49.127 --> 48:49.959
I'm sorry.

48:49.961 --> 48:54.196
So, how do things look
for y'all finding my car?

48:54.198 --> 48:58.701
Well, if we find it,
we'll call you.

48:58.703 --> 49:01.704

49:40.678 --> 49:42.278

49:45.183 --> 49:46.749
[Lydia] What's wrong with you?

49:46.751 --> 49:49.051
I'm sorry.
I just got nervous.

49:49.053 --> 49:51.554
What do you have
to be nervous about?

49:51.556 --> 49:55.124
Our car got stolen, remember?

49:56.294 --> 49:59.061
And I don't appreciate you
making me look like an asshole

49:59.063 --> 50:00.196

there, buddy.

-[clattering]

dinner right now,

50:34.399 --> 50:37.066
You know how we talked about
there being grown-ups

at recess?

Yes. Well, some people
like Justin Becker

50:45.109 --> 50:47.243
just up and stole
your Daddy's car.

50:47.245 --> 50:49.211

get it back?

50:55.420 --> 50:57.553
When was it stolen?

50:58.056 --> 50:59.588
Last night.

51:00.158 --> 51:02.191
-Nuh-uh.
-Yuh-huh!

51:02.193 --> 51:04.393
[Cynthia] No. You drove me
in it this morning.

51:04.395 --> 51:06.328
No, baby girl.
That was Earl's car.

51:06.330 --> 51:09.465
Nuh-uh. Before that.
At the gas station.

51:09.467 --> 51:10.599
Yeah. This morning.

51:10.601 --> 51:13.202
Before we came
and took a bath.

51:13.371 --> 51:15.571
What's she talking about,
Zeke?

51:15.573 --> 51:16.705
She's confused.

51:16.707 --> 51:18.774
Maybe it's not stolen!

51:18.776 --> 51:22.378
Sweetheart, did Daddy take you
to school this morning?

51:22.380 --> 51:24.547
[Cynthia] No. Earl Wyeth did.

51:24.549 --> 51:26.215
See, there you go.

51:26.217 --> 51:30.586
[Cynthia] Daddy drove me to
the gas station in his car.

51:30.588 --> 51:32.555
The rusty one.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.458
Sweetheart, dinner'll be ready
in a bit.

51:35.460 --> 51:39.462
Why don't you go run and play
with your Playmobils.

51:39.464 --> 51:40.629
Did I get Daddy in trouble?

51:40.631 --> 51:42.331
-No, honey.
-Yes, you did get Daddy in

51:42.333 --> 51:45.367
-trouble, thank you, baby.
-You shut up.

51:45.369 --> 51:47.436
Run off, Cynthia.

51:54.879 --> 51:58.214
What the hell
was she talking about, Zeke?

52:00.284 --> 52:02.251
She's confused.

52:02.253 --> 52:05.521
No, she ain't confused.
You're lying.

52:05.523 --> 52:08.858
No, I can see it
on your face, liar.

52:08.860 --> 52:10.693
What's going on?

52:10.795 --> 52:12.895
Hey, what happened last night?

52:12.897 --> 52:13.896
Shut the refrigerator door.

52:13.898 --> 52:15.898
You're makin'
all our food rotten.

52:15.900 --> 52:17.666
[door closes]

52:20.404 --> 52:22.471
[Spenser]
DNA results come back?

52:22.473 --> 52:24.140
[Dr. Richter] Yeah,

52:24.142 --> 52:27.143
-afraid they did.
-Negative?

52:27.211 --> 52:27.810
I'm sorry, what?

52:27.812 --> 52:32.581
I mean... I mean inconclusive.
They came back inconclusive?

52:32.583 --> 52:34.483
Yes, initially.

52:34.485 --> 52:37.286
Since then, we've been able to

52:37.288 --> 52:40.389
nail down something
a little more conclusive.

52:40.391 --> 52:42.558
If that's what
you want to call it.

52:42.560 --> 52:46.595
Lydia, there are some things
that you shouldn't know.

52:48.833 --> 52:50.499
Try me.

52:52.737 --> 52:55.204
It's none of your business.

53:00.811 --> 53:02.444
Dick...

53:07.852 --> 53:10.452
Dick Long is dead.

53:13.491 --> 53:14.857
What?

53:15.726 --> 53:17.693
He died last night.

53:21.599 --> 53:22.898
Well, shoot.

53:22.900 --> 53:25.968
All right, the semen,
the sperm.

53:26.504 --> 53:30.206
It's... It's not
from a human being.

53:33.544 --> 53:34.376
I'm sorry?

53:34.378 --> 53:38.414
I'm sorry, too, Spence,
but it's not human.

53:38.416 --> 53:41.784
What hap... How did he die?

53:41.786 --> 53:44.486
He fell on a table saw.

53:45.590 --> 53:49.592
What were you sawing
in the middle of the night?

53:50.962 --> 53:54.296
Jesus, Zeke.
Tell me the truth!

53:54.298 --> 53:55.864
I'm gonna...
I don't know.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.833
How did he die?

53:59.003 --> 54:01.003
He got shot.

54:02.406 --> 54:03.939
By a hunter.

54:07.411 --> 54:09.011
Alcohol poisoning. Fuck!

54:09.013 --> 54:10.579
Zeke.

54:12.550 --> 54:14.717
It was a slip and fall!

54:21.826 --> 54:24.326
Lydia, you don't want to know.

54:25.563 --> 54:26.862
Now.

54:26.931 --> 54:29.331
Are you talking
about the semen?

54:29.333 --> 54:29.965
Yes, ma'am.

54:29.967 --> 54:33.369
[Spenser] Where in the hell
did it come from then?

54:33.604 --> 54:35.571
It's from a horse.

54:37.775 --> 54:41.377
As in... An equine.

54:41.479 --> 54:43.545
It was fucking Comet.

54:43.547 --> 54:45.347
[Lydia] The truth!

54:45.349 --> 54:46.515
That is the truth!

54:46.517 --> 54:50.552
[stammering] What was
he doing riding Comet?

54:50.554 --> 54:51.920
No...

54:56.694 --> 54:59.695
Comet fucked him to death.

55:07.505 --> 55:08.837
Huh?

55:14.078 --> 55:17.446
Are you joking?

55:18.382 --> 55:20.849
I don't... I don't understand.

55:24.388 --> 55:26.855
You can't be serious.

55:27.925 --> 55:30.426
I don't know what to say.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.063
This happened...

55:36.634 --> 55:38.067
-Last night?
-Mmm-hmm.

55:38.069 --> 55:40.969
-After band practice.
-Mmm-hmm.

55:45.409 --> 55:47.810
What... What did you...
What did you do?

55:47.812 --> 55:50.045
Did you just...

55:51.349 --> 55:53.582
Were you there?

55:56.987 --> 55:58.587
No.

55:59.824 --> 56:03.726
You can't be serious.
This is... [exclaims softly]

56:07.064 --> 56:10.532
Uh... Did you...

56:11.502 --> 56:13.702
-Partake?
-Lydia...

56:13.704 --> 56:17.573
No... No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

56:17.708 --> 56:18.941
Oh, my God.

56:18.943 --> 56:21.977
Oh, all of those
"band practices."

56:21.979 --> 56:24.113
What the fuck? Zeke,
do you even have a band?

56:24.115 --> 56:26.715
Please. Pink Freud.
You know I have a band.

56:26.717 --> 56:31.453
So, for the past eight years,
you've been... [sniffling]

56:33.023 --> 56:34.857
Oh, my God.

56:35.393 --> 56:37.025
Oh, my God.

56:37.595 --> 56:39.128
[gasping]

56:39.597 --> 56:41.029
[grunts]

56:44.568 --> 56:45.134
Oh, my God.

56:45.136 --> 56:46.935
I'm sorry, I don't know
what to say.

56:46.937 --> 56:49.838
Just stop. Stop.

56:51.709 --> 56:54.076
Stop touching me!

57:01.519 --> 57:03.118
Oh, my God.

57:07.425 --> 57:09.525
I'm sorry, Lydia, you know me.

57:09.527 --> 57:10.793
No, I don't.

57:10.795 --> 57:14.696
You fuckin' pervert
and a fucking weedhead!

57:14.698 --> 57:17.199
It's gotta be something to do
with the weed,

57:17.201 --> 57:18.734
you fucking stoner!

57:18.736 --> 57:20.602
You don't even know what
you're doing half your life!

57:20.604 --> 57:22.171
Lydia. It's not anything
to do... I just...

57:22.173 --> 57:24.440
I'm just who I am,
who I say I am...

57:24.442 --> 57:25.441
Fucking bestiality!

57:25.443 --> 57:27.643
-...who I told you I am.
-Are you kidding me?

57:27.645 --> 57:29.211
Baby, please, come on.

57:29.213 --> 57:31.847
Just... Just get out.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.949
Zeke, just... Just leave.

57:34.185 --> 57:35.050
Baby, listen.

57:35.052 --> 57:38.220
Get the fuck out of my house!

57:45.796 --> 57:47.629
Don't you talk to her.

57:55.573 --> 57:57.206
-[Zeke] Lydia.
-I'm calling the cops!

57:57.208 --> 58:00.609
No, don't do that.
Lydia, don't do that.

58:00.978 --> 58:02.544
Lydia.

58:02.813 --> 58:05.047
I don't know what to say!

58:10.221 --> 58:11.186
Lydia, please!

58:11.188 --> 58:16.058
-You stay away from us.
-Baby, we didn't hurt Dick.

58:16.594 --> 58:18.093
Please.

58:19.029 --> 58:21.196
[Zeke] Lydia, don't make me
break this door down.

58:21.198 --> 58:24.700
Get away from us,
you cocksucker.

58:25.035 --> 58:25.868
[glass shatters]

58:25.870 --> 58:29.905
-Fucking fuck! Fuck me.
-[clattering]

58:31.108 --> 58:32.608
Fuck!

58:32.743 --> 58:34.676
Are you all right?

58:36.046 --> 58:37.746
Oh.

58:37.815 --> 58:39.147
Ezekiel...

58:41.118 --> 58:43.819
-Zeke...
-[Zeke] Fuck.

58:45.789 --> 58:47.256
Zeke...

58:48.592 --> 58:51.593
-Hey, stop!
-[Zeke] Fuck you!

58:51.929 --> 58:53.629
I'm sorry.

58:53.697 --> 58:56.164
I... [stammers]

58:57.034 --> 58:58.267
I just...

58:58.269 --> 59:01.203
I wish there was
something I could say.

59:08.012 --> 59:10.112
Is this real life?

59:27.197 --> 59:30.332
[indistinct police
radio chatter]

59:30.601 --> 59:31.833
So...

59:31.902 --> 59:33.602
[Spenser] Hmm.

59:47.017 --> 59:47.950
How's that?

59:47.952 --> 59:49.751
[Zeke] That's fine.

59:49.920 --> 59:51.186
Ow.

59:51.188 --> 59:52.721
Ow.

59:54.325 --> 59:58.694
I just, I can't...
Zeke, I just... I can't...

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.231
You want me to go?

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:05.734
Yes.

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:07.235
Yes, I do.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:11.039
I understand.

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:16.912
Uh...

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:20.649
I appreciate you givin' me
a little first aid.

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.252
You're welcome.

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:27.656
You want
I should pack up some...

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:28.624
Just leave.

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:30.192
You can get your stuff
some other time.

01:00:30.194 --> 01:00:32.260
You just leave right now.

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:35.897
I'm just gonna say
goodbye to Cyn.

01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:37.733
That's fine.

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:40.335
Fine.

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:45.340
I love you.

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:01.156
[Lydia] Zeke.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:04.893
I think I deserve
to know what...

01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:06.728
-What?
-[stammering]

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.430
I don't know what to say.

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:10.098
Yes, you do.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.869
You're just a coward.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:21.677
[Zeke] We never done
anything like that before.

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.781
Not what...

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.149
Not what Dick did last night.

01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:30.852
I mean, not in particular.
Not specifically.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:36.892
I mean, we'd gone down there
and done stuff before, but...

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.395
Look, I don't think there's
anything I could say

01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:43.732
that'd make it okay
or make you understand it,

01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:46.802
'cause I don't
understand it myself.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:55.444
Me and Earl
have been doin' that stuff

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.848
with, uh, Comet

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:03.185
since long before
I even met you, so...

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:06.855
Didn't have anything
to do with you.

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.392
But I love you.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.167
I'm pathetic.

01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:23.772
I'm sorry.

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:26.775
I don't know.

01:02:26.777 --> 01:02:29.311
Guess when you're lonely,
it doesn't always go away

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.313
when you get married.

I'm gonna have to leave
for a little while.

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:25.000
Well...

01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:28.436
Because of why Mom

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:30.005
Yeah.

01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:32.507
She's upset about the car.

01:03:33.944 --> 01:03:35.210
Why?

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:37.445
Cars are expensive, baby.

It's an insult.

01:03:57.868 --> 01:04:01.536
Momma was very upset
with me, okay?

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:04.272
But what does it mean?

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:07.242
It means I suck
on penises, okay?

01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:09.311
But I don't, so...

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:16.251
I gotta take off, all right?

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:18.320
Might not see you for a while.

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:21.122
I'm not sure
what's gonna happen.

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:25.360
What about my piano recital?

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:28.296
Oh, I'll be there for that.

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:30.198
Definitely!

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:35.237
Definitely be there for that.

I need you to know that
I love you very much, okay?

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:48.316
I love you and your momma
very much.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.953
Okay.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:57.392
Mmm.

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:03.164

Yeah, real bad. Yeah.

Is everything

Pretty sure no.

What? Okay, what...
What happened?

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:48.370
Don't worry, dude.
They don't know shit.

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:53.541
All right, here we go.
Earl, you want anything?

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:54.409
Naw, I'm cool.

01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:55.643

like, onion rings

with some honey mustard sauce.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:01.549
-Okay.
-Oh, well, hold up.

And, uh, let me get a...

-Is that all?
-That's all.

What'd you do to your hand?

01:07:14.297 --> 01:07:16.765
Punched a pane of glass.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.534
I keep thinking Dick's gonna
come back and kill us

You're into some seriously
fucked up shit, okay?

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.348
You need to
really look inside yourself

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:34.749
and come to terms with that.

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:37.285
[clicks tongue]
I mean, I have.

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:38.820
Just do it.

01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:41.322
Yeah, I know.

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:43.224
[waitress] All right.
There you go.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:47.328
[clears throat] Excuse me, uh,
I asked for honey mustard.

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:49.230
Well, that's... [stammers]

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.399
-It's not.
-No, this is like honey Dijon.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.301
It's got, like,
a spiciness to it.

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:54.769
AKA tastes fuckin' nasty.

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:56.604
Would it be possible
to trade this just for, like,

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:59.607
the bright yellow normal stuff
they put on salads?

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:02.644
'Cause that's all
I'm asking for.

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:04.712
[waitress] Yes.

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:06.281
Tight.

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:08.216
You're an asshole.

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:11.619
I'm not an asshole, man.
I just know what I like.

[people cheering]

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:21.763
Glad they found each other.

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:30.138
Let me ask you something

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:33.741
on behalf
of my buddy there, Ted. Uh...

01:08:34.578 --> 01:08:37.578
What is your full name?

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:38.446
It's Theodore.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:41.749
Huh? Hey! Hear that, Duds?

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:45.687
[grunts]
Another officer's named Edward

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:47.654
and he goes by Ted, too.

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:48.890
I guess it's pretty rare.

01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:51.225
Mmm. Bob's another one.

01:08:51.228 --> 01:08:56.331
Bob not so bad.
But Dick, that's a weird one.

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:59.501
How do you get "Dick"
outta "Richard"?

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:03.904
[Spenser] You'll have to ask
his wife.

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:06.207
[Spenser laughs]

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:07.809
Wait, what?

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:11.712
He says, "How do you get
'Dick' outta 'Richard'?"

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:14.482
And I go, "You'll have to
ask his wife!"

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.417
Yeah, no. I know, but...

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:17.919
"Dick" is short for "Richard"?

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:21.221
Oh, yeah.
You didn't know that, Duds?

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:23.691
Wait.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:27.562
Did Zeke Olson give me
his friend's wallet?

01:09:27.564 --> 01:09:29.229
[Spenser] Huh?

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:35.837
Okay, his wife said Dick left
his driver's license.

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:40.207
The wallet belonged
to Richard Long,

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:43.310
and it didn't have
a driver's license.

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.881
Why would he do that?

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:52.487
[scoffs] I don't know.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.960
-It's good?
-Mmm.

01:10:08.672 --> 01:10:10.371
[Zeke] Did you break
your chair?

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:12.307
[Earl] Yeah, it sucks.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.842
Yo, I should fuckin' legit
bounce tonight.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:18.680
Hey, yo, the places in
Shelby County should be cheap.

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:28.423
Take me home.

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:31.359
I ain't takin' you home.

01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:33.761
Take me the fuck home.
Are you serious, dude?

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:35.597
I ain't takin' you home.

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:41.236
I'm not taking you home.

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:03.491
All right.

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:12.700
[car door closes]

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:15.436
I'll, uh...

01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:19.641
Talk to you soon.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.356
[Dudley] Still nothing
with the Longs.

01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:10.658
Called twice earlier
just about the wallet

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.460
to no availability.

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:13.961
"No avail."

01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:16.397
I'll head over to the Longs.

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:18.566
You head over to the Olsons.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.968
Come in here first, though.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:25.073
Sit, I mean.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:26.841
All right.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:32.113
I told you that you didn't
have to crack the case.

01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:33.514
Yeah, I just...

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:36.584
You might could use this.

01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:39.954
If the missing car
at the Olsons'

01:12:39.956 --> 01:12:43.958
and Ezekiel Olson's behavior

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.896
are any way related
to our John Doe,

01:12:50.567 --> 01:12:53.101
you'd better brace yourself.

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:55.370
Pineapple juice?

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:56.504
No, thanks.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:57.972
Yeah, okay.

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:02.477

Holy moly.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:24.826
There's no one here.

Nah. Anything from Dudley?

There you go.
That's a good boy.

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:46.948
Sorry. I saw a light on.

No. That's all right.
I was just...

There's no

[Zeke] No.

01:14:57.026 --> 01:15:00.027
No, we had... We canceled it.

You couldn't get in touch
with Dick?

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.266
Yeah.

from him all day.

I'm worried.

01:15:23.887 --> 01:15:25.286
Oh, yeah?

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.956
Yeah, I feel bad.

01:15:29.592 --> 01:15:31.092
What? Why?

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:34.595
I was too lazy
to make dinner last night.

[opens can]

01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:39.700
I don't know why. I just,
like, didn't feel like it.

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:43.538
Too tired from school I think
or something. So...

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.741
Dick had to go out
and get Arby's.

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:50.044
I could have made meatloaf
or something.

01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:54.315
There's no way
you could have known.

No.

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:37.158

I'm sorry I don't know
what I'm doing here.

01:16:57.647 --> 01:17:00.881

That's all right.
It's okay.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:08.923
Oh, yeah. I should get going.
I should be home just in case.

01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:14.729
Yeah. Go home.
Get you some sleep. Rest up.

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.865
I'll walk ya to your car.

01:17:20.903 --> 01:17:22.803
[Jane] What happened
to your hand?

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:25.740
[Zeke] Aw, nothing.
I got bit by a dog.

01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:27.975
A dog? Sammy?

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:30.811
Yeah. No. Just a dog.

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:36.951
Holy crap.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.919
What's going on?

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:41.222
I'm not sure.

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:45.226
Wait here for a second.

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:51.666
Mr. Olson, I didn't know
you were home.

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:52.667
Neither did I.

01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:53.668
I was at the barn.

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:57.972
The Mrs. and I had a little
disagreement after y'all left.

01:17:57.974 --> 01:18:00.141
I've been out there,
everything okay?

01:18:00.143 --> 01:18:01.409
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just...

01:18:01.411 --> 01:18:04.345
I had a few more questions
for you about your car.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:06.247
I hope it's not too late.

01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:09.116
No, it's fine. No, it's...

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:10.451
Hi.

01:18:10.453 --> 01:18:11.786
Hello, there.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:13.287
I seem to have stumbled
into a bit of a...

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:14.455
[Zeke] No, it's nothing.
It's...

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:16.123
[Jane] Oh, I'm a friend.
I was leaving.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.125
Just... Everything okay?

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:22.029
Well, Olson's car
was stolen last night.

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:23.764
Oh, God.

01:18:28.004 --> 01:18:29.737
[door closes]

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:37.311
-You wanna come inside?
-Thank you.

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:58.332
[Jane] Car was stolen?

01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:01.135
[Lydia] Yeah,
can you believe it?

01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:04.271
[Jane] Horrible. My God.

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:05.806
May I?

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:08.876
[stammers]
By all means, please.

01:19:09.112 --> 01:19:11.746
[Jane] Don't know
what's this town is coming to.

01:19:11.748 --> 01:19:13.781
Murder and grand theft car?

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:15.416
We're doing the best
we can, ma'am.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:17.084
-It's Jane.
-[Zeke clears throat]

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.754
So ya'all found
my car yet, ma'am?

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.489
No. Not yet.

01:19:21.491 --> 01:19:22.990
Uh, we just left so abruptly,

01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:24.425
I thought
I might should come by

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:26.994
and get some more down
'fore the night's out.

01:19:26.996 --> 01:19:28.896
All right, sounds good to me.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:32.933
Y'all want... Y'all want
something to drink?

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:35.102
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:37.104
Got a PBR.

01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:39.807
[Lydia clearing throat]

01:19:39.876 --> 01:19:41.442
[Zeke] What, uh...

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.846
What can I do you for?

01:19:45.848 --> 01:19:48.048
I've just got
a few more questions.

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:50.284
[Jane] Which car
was stolen, Lydia?

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:52.186
[Lydia] It...
The station wagon.

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:54.155
[Zeke] Yeah, last night.
Right out the...

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:55.222
Right out the basement.

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:57.858
[Dudley] Mrs. Olson,
if you could have a seat, too,

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.961
we can get this over with
real quick.

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:08.936
[whispers] I'm sorry.
She's put out with me.

01:20:11.207 --> 01:20:12.907
Be right back.

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:16.877
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:22.917
Lyds, what are you doing?

01:20:25.388 --> 01:20:28.923
What the hell
is Jane doing here?

01:20:28.925 --> 01:20:31.091
She's lookin' for Dick.

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.894
Goddammit, Zeke! I can't...

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:36.463
-Keep a tight...
-Don't touch me!

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.037
I need you to keep your calm,
all right?

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:45.940
You need me to lie
to one of my best friends.

01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:48.108
[whispers] Need to make you...

01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:51.612
I need you.

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:53.914
[laughs]

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.016
Okay, great. Thanks.

01:20:56.485 --> 01:21:01.255
I should just go.
This is none of my business.

01:21:02.925 --> 01:21:04.391
You can go.

01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:06.861
I don't have any questions

01:21:06.863 --> 01:21:09.496
I need to ask you,
I don't think.

01:21:11.234 --> 01:21:12.967
Do you have?

01:21:16.105 --> 01:21:20.007
No. Uh... I was just here
looking for my husband.

01:21:20.009 --> 01:21:22.176
'Cause he's in a band
with Zeke.

01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:23.978
Oh, yeah?

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:26.146
Oh, what kinda music
do they play?

01:21:26.148 --> 01:21:28.148
Mostly classic rock.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:30.584
Oh, that's cool.

01:21:30.653 --> 01:21:33.454
Can we come up
with a fuckin' plan?

01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:36.223
Why did you come back?

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:37.892
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:41.228
A fucking motel or something,
for Chrissakes!

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:45.666
Zeke, you're dragging
this back into your family.

01:21:45.668 --> 01:21:46.634
This is too much.

01:21:46.636 --> 01:21:49.470
Why didn't you just go
to Earl's or something?

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:50.671
Earl's gone.

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:52.406
Was he...

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:55.309
[groans softly]

01:21:57.313 --> 01:21:59.914
You have a serious problem.

01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:03.217
-I know.
-No, you don't.

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:04.652
You wouldn't know
what the truth was

01:22:04.654 --> 01:22:07.321
if it slapped you in the face.

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:10.524
[groans softly]

01:22:17.667 --> 01:22:19.266
Fuck you.

01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:22.603
They're called Pink Freud.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:26.507
-That's awesome.
-[clears throat] She's coming.

01:22:26.943 --> 01:22:30.678
Uh, Jane here's just
telling me about y'all's band.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.047
Y'all want anything to drink?

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:35.516
I'm fine, thank you.

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:39.086
Right. [grunts]

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:45.159
-[door opens]
-[gasps softly]

01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:50.230
Oh, sweetheart, just...
Go back to bed.

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:53.233
It's okay.

01:22:55.037 --> 01:22:56.603
[door closes]

01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.640
Fuck.

01:23:00.176 --> 01:23:03.344
[clears throat, sniffling]

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:08.048
If we can get this show
on the road that'd be great.

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:10.517
It's been a long day.

01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:11.618
I understand.

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.520
Sorry, I should get going.

01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:14.655
[Lydia] No, no, no, it's fine.

01:23:14.657 --> 01:23:16.623
Um, have some coffee
before you leave.

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:19.693
Oh, it's all right, Lydia,
don't worry about it.

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:22.196
No, it's fine. Just sit!

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:25.232
[Dudley] I only have
a few questions for you.

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:26.100
[Zeke] Shoot.

01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:27.534
Uh, first off,
we're gonna have to get

01:23:27.536 --> 01:23:30.204
the registration number
and everything from you.

01:23:30.206 --> 01:23:31.572
All right.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:35.376
Oh, thank you.

01:23:35.378 --> 01:23:36.610
Take it, ma'am.

01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:38.645
-Oh, no, thank you, ma'am.
-Oh.

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:40.381
I'll take it.

01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:47.187
Are you okay, hon?

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:48.555
No, I'm fine. Just... Y'know.

01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:52.092
[Dudley] Well, I guess my main
question, Mr. and Mrs. Olson,

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:53.694
is why did you wait
until tonight

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:55.729
to report the car as stolen?

01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:57.297
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:23:57.299 --> 01:23:59.800
I guess
I didn't really notice it.

01:23:59.802 --> 01:24:03.237
You didn't notice that
your car had been stolen?

01:24:03.239 --> 01:24:07.741
It's not really... Doesn't...
Not really a good car.

01:24:08.511 --> 01:24:10.411
Okay, I'm sorry,
but earlier you said

01:24:10.413 --> 01:24:12.179
you thought the thieves
took that car

01:24:12.181 --> 01:24:14.581
because it was the good one.

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:21.055
[Zeke] Well...

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:25.259
It's a station wagon.

01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:27.061
And he says
he doesn't like to drive it

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:28.495
because it makes him look gay.

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:32.066
Yeah, a total gaylord car.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:33.267
Uh-huh.

01:24:33.269 --> 01:24:36.770
So, when exactly when did you
notice that it was missing?

01:24:36.772 --> 01:24:39.606
[Zeke] When Lydia got home,
she noticed it.

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:42.409
[Dudley] Is that right,
Mrs. Olson?

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:43.544
6:00.

01:24:43.546 --> 01:24:45.679
[Dudley] And, uh, Mr. Olson,
was that before

01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:48.715
or after you borrowed
your friend's car?

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:54.254
That would be before.

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:57.157
Oh, all right.

01:24:57.159 --> 01:24:59.793
Um, and what's your
friend's name again?

01:24:59.795 --> 01:25:01.562
Earl.

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:05.766
-Wyeth. Earl Wyeth.
-Uh-huh.

01:25:06.335 --> 01:25:08.435
Does he live around here?

01:25:08.637 --> 01:25:09.336
No.

01:25:09.338 --> 01:25:13.807
He's just through the woods.
Meth Mountain trailer park.

01:25:13.809 --> 01:25:14.741
Don't call it that.

01:25:14.743 --> 01:25:18.879
It's three miles in.
But he just skipped town.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:23.283
I'm just... Jane, you want
some coffee or something?

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.119
I mean, more.
Do you want more coffee?

01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:27.221
I'm fine,
I hardly drank any of it.

01:25:27.223 --> 01:25:29.656
[Dudley] I could really use
some straight answers

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:32.192
from you, Mr. Olson.

01:25:32.394 --> 01:25:34.761
Huh? I'm sorry, go on.

01:25:35.731 --> 01:25:36.663
Go right ahead.

01:25:36.665 --> 01:25:38.165
[Lydia] Zeke,
did you give Jane, um...

01:25:38.167 --> 01:25:39.700
[Dudley] About the wallet
you gave me.

01:25:39.702 --> 01:25:40.400
What?

01:25:40.402 --> 01:25:43.137
[Dudley] Where'd you
find it exactly?

01:25:43.239 --> 01:25:44.204
Lydia, did you, um...

01:25:44.206 --> 01:25:45.672
[Zeke] I don't really
remember... The bar?

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:48.809
And do you know
who it belonged to?

01:25:49.278 --> 01:25:50.878
Richard Long?

01:25:52.248 --> 01:25:53.747
Excuse me?

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:56.183
I'm sorry?

01:25:57.153 --> 01:26:02.489
Did you just say he gave you
my husband's wallet?

01:26:03.259 --> 01:26:04.825
Wait, what?

01:26:06.362 --> 01:26:09.563
Well, Richard Long
is my husband.

01:26:10.599 --> 01:26:12.232
Pink Freud.

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.836
Y'all called about his wallet?

01:26:18.307 --> 01:26:20.307
You're Mrs. Long?

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:23.777
[Jane] Yeah.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:27.814
Zeke, why didn't you
just call us?

01:26:28.817 --> 01:26:32.386
[Dudley] Mr. Olson, I... What?

01:26:32.388 --> 01:26:33.253
[mumbling]

01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:38.292
Left... He left
his wallet here last night.

01:26:40.196 --> 01:26:41.395
[Dudley] Why didn't you just

01:26:41.397 --> 01:26:44.932
give it back to him tonight
at practice, then?

01:26:49.471 --> 01:26:50.871
I dunno.

01:26:53.275 --> 01:26:55.776
I... I don't know anything.

01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:59.680
Zeke?

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:03.884
[Dudley] Mr. Olson?

01:27:10.292 --> 01:27:13.860
Lydia didn't know about
any of this until tonight.

01:27:13.862 --> 01:27:17.831
Know about any of what,
Mr. Olson?

01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:25.872
Zeke!

01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:33.580
Mr. Olson!

01:27:34.683 --> 01:27:36.683
[panting]

01:27:37.519 --> 01:27:38.885
[grunts]

01:27:45.794 --> 01:27:48.695
-C'mon. C'mon.
-[horse grunting]

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:52.666
What the hell is going on?

01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:59.706
I gotta talk to you about
something, sweetheart.

01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:09.516
[Dudley] Mr. Olson!
Come out of the barn

01:28:09.518 --> 01:28:12.019
with your hands
above your head.

01:28:15.057 --> 01:28:19.593
C'mon, c'mon!
Go on, go on, go on!

01:28:19.595 --> 01:28:23.563
What are you doing go! Go!
Go on!

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:26.800
Hold it right there!

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:28.702
Go on! [groans]

01:28:29.371 --> 01:28:31.505
[coughing]

01:28:33.075 --> 01:28:35.709
Now, go! Go!

01:28:40.049 --> 01:28:42.082
Sorry, Officer.

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.993
[engine revving]

01:28:56.332 --> 01:28:58.699
[indistinct shouting]

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:06.006
[Spenser] Missed
<i> NCIS: New Orleans</i> last night.

01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:07.841
[Dudley] What episode was it?

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:09.109
I said I missed it, Duds.

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:11.812
Oh, right, right, right.

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:18.552
We're not going to
hold Ezekiel Olson.

01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:21.755
I'm sorry, ma'am, but what?

01:29:21.957 --> 01:29:25.492
[sighs] Dick Long's
death certificate

01:29:25.494 --> 01:29:29.896
reads
"Death by misadventure."

01:29:30.632 --> 01:29:32.532
Not a homicide.

01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:35.802
Charge Olson
with Reckless Endangerment,

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:36.903
obstruction of justice.

01:29:36.905 --> 01:29:39.606
I mean, those are just
the PG charges, ma'am!

01:29:39.608 --> 01:29:41.441
He's a pervert!

01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:43.477
Excuse me.

01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:46.546
All right, but...

01:29:46.615 --> 01:29:49.449
How 'bout you check
with Mrs. Long?

01:29:49.451 --> 01:29:54.388
See if she wants that
broadcast on Fox6.

01:29:54.390 --> 01:30:00.727
See how Zeke Olson's daughter
feels 'bout pressing charges.

01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:02.429
That's some terrible logic.

01:30:02.431 --> 01:30:06.800
Well, not sayin' it's logical.
Not sayin' that at all.

01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:08.935
[sighs]

01:30:09.805 --> 01:30:11.171
You know,

01:30:12.408 --> 01:30:17.110
this is the second time
this has happened.

01:30:17.513 --> 01:30:19.913
What? Are you kidding me?

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:24.985
[laughing]
Of course I'm kidding you!

01:30:24.987 --> 01:30:26.453
Oh, c'mon, Dudley!

01:30:26.455 --> 01:30:30.524
What's the matter with you?
Lordy.

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:32.125
-You c'mon.
-[laughing]

01:30:32.127 --> 01:30:34.828
I don't think
it's funny at all.

01:30:36.698 --> 01:30:41.134
People sure are inscrutable
on their insides, huh?

01:30:44.006 --> 01:30:48.942
I don't know what else
besides that to say, I guess.

01:31:11.867 --> 01:31:14.000
You rather stay here, man?

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:07.287
[whispers] Zeke.

01:32:32.247 --> 01:32:34.781
What're you doing here?

01:32:34.783 --> 01:32:37.551
I'm out
on my own recognizance.

01:32:37.553 --> 01:32:39.252
How's that workin' out?

01:32:40.188 --> 01:32:41.788
We'll see.

01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:44.891
Zeke, just stop it.
What are you doing here?

01:32:46.595 --> 01:32:49.329
I'd like to kiss you goodbye.

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:51.998
Zeke, don't.

01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:02.275
I'm sorry.

01:33:02.277 --> 01:33:03.877
I know.

01:33:07.616 --> 01:33:09.849
[engine starts]

01:33:44.886 --> 01:33:47.287
It's pretty good, honeybutt.

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:09.876
[utensil clatters]

01:34:23.992 --> 01:34:26.660
I heard you burned
the house down today,

01:34:26.662 --> 01:34:28.128
is that right?

01:34:28.697 --> 01:34:30.163
[Cynthia] I guess.

01:34:30.165 --> 01:34:31.431
That's wonderful.

01:34:31.433 --> 01:34:34.167
[Lydia] I'm gonna
put her down, Dad.

01:34:39.307 --> 01:34:41.074
[Lydia sighs]

01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:45.378
-[Lydia sighs deeply]
-Mmm.

01:34:45.947 --> 01:34:48.314
I want to do your cat face.

01:34:54.289 --> 01:34:57.090
[both giggle]

01:35:21.783 --> 01:35:22.782
[taps car]

01:35:22.784 --> 01:35:24.484
[Zeke] Thank you, buddy!

01:35:27.789 --> 01:35:32.826
Oh, shit. Oh, look who finally
came to their senses.

01:35:32.828 --> 01:35:34.494
-You all right?
-I gotta sit down.

01:35:34.496 --> 01:35:36.229
Yeah, go for it.

01:35:37.032 --> 01:35:38.732
What happened?

01:35:40.268 --> 01:35:42.368
I gotta leave town with you.

01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:46.139
Yeah, well, as soon as
we leave here, we'll be cool.

01:35:47.743 --> 01:35:49.109
-Yeah.
-[door opens]

01:35:49.111 --> 01:35:52.378
Earl Wyeth,
I'm goin' to bed if...

01:35:53.215 --> 01:35:55.215
Well, hey, there, Zeke.

01:35:55.217 --> 01:35:56.983
Hey, there, to you.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.253
[Lake] You comin' with us?

01:36:01.389 --> 01:36:03.289
[Zeke] I guess so.

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:05.992
Well, dang, Zeke.

01:36:05.994 --> 01:36:08.027
You're a good guy
for comin' along

01:36:08.029 --> 01:36:10.130
when your friend's in need.

01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:14.067
All right.

01:36:15.904 --> 01:36:16.870
Y'all wanna get weird?

01:36:16.872 --> 01:36:18.204
[Zeke] Naw, I'm all good.
Appreciate it.

01:36:18.206 --> 01:36:20.206
[Earl] No, I'm good. I don't
want to do it right now.

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:22.475
All right. Y'all are weird.

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:28.114
Earl...

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:30.150
I asked her to come with me.

01:36:30.152 --> 01:36:31.117
What'd you tell her?

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:34.254
I dunno, I told her
I had some family shit.

01:36:34.489 --> 01:36:38.258
So what happens
when we end up nowhere?

01:36:44.266 --> 01:36:45.198
