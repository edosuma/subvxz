WEBVTT

00:00.156 --> 00:01.560
Oh.

00:15.096 --> 00:18.173
Oh, er, that boiled ham has reached
it's sell-by date tomorrow.

00:18.175 --> 00:20.161
CLICK

00:20.164 --> 00:23.138
Hey, did you hear that click?

00:23.140 --> 00:28.089
That's me switching
to boiled ham selling mode.

00:28.091 --> 00:29.161
Watch and learn.

00:29.164 --> 00:31.178
Watch and learn.

00:31.179 --> 00:34.103
Oh, good day to you, Mrs Boiled Ham.

00:37.095 --> 00:38.183
Oh, sorry. Kath.

00:40.112 --> 00:41.161
You called me boiled ham.

00:41.164 --> 00:43.137
Yes, I did, didn't I?

00:43.140 --> 00:46.136
Yes. Of course, there's absolutely no
resemblance.

00:48.124 --> 00:50.173
It's just it's on me brain.

00:50.176 --> 00:52.170
Been thinking about it all day.

00:52.171 --> 00:57.121
I'm looking forward to having that
last slice of delicious...

00:57.124 --> 00:59.137
Last slice?
Mm.

00:59.140 --> 01:00.161
Oh.

01:00.164 --> 01:02.097
That's a pity.

01:02.100 --> 01:03.165
Eric likes his boiled ham.

01:03.167 --> 01:05.176
Oh, right, keeps him docile, does it?

01:08.168 --> 01:10.126
Are you sure it's the last slice?

01:10.128 --> 01:12.126
Oh, yes, unfortunately.

01:12.128 --> 01:16.105
I'm looking forward to having it
with a nice little bit of pickle.

01:16.108 --> 01:17.140
Tough.

01:39.108 --> 01:41.103
HE YAWNS

01:51.123 --> 01:52.146
All right.

01:52.147 --> 01:53.168
TILL RINGS

01:58.171 --> 02:01.123
Now, that one doesn't go in there.
Ha-ha!

02:03.159 --> 02:05.180
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

02:07.135 --> 02:09.138
You bought too much boiled ham.

02:09.139 --> 02:11.122
That's not the problem.

02:11.123 --> 02:13.134
The problem is we haven't sold
enough.

02:13.135 --> 02:16.086
It's like that other daft thing you
bought on the internet.

02:16.087 --> 02:18.134
Oh, it wasn't daft,
not at the price.

02:18.135 --> 02:20.141
Dr Proctor's Perfect Posture.

02:20.144 --> 02:23.156
Support where you need it,
inflatable underwear.

02:25.123 --> 02:27.153
Yes, I've got plans for that.

02:27.156 --> 02:30.086
You're not getting me in it.

02:30.087 --> 02:32.158
It's trying to stop you getting
out of your underwear that's

02:32.159 --> 02:34.162
the problem at your age.

02:34.163 --> 02:37.090
DOORBELL RINGS

02:37.091 --> 02:39.141
HE BURPS

02:39.144 --> 02:42.146
What have you got for...?
Boiled ham.

02:42.147 --> 02:44.114
An upset stomach.

02:44.115 --> 02:45.162
Boiled ham.

02:45.163 --> 02:49.165
It's been known for generations
as a cure for upset stomachs.

02:49.168 --> 02:52.110
The Aztecs used to swear by it.

02:52.111 --> 02:54.153
I thought they did human sacrifice.

02:54.156 --> 02:57.135
Oh, yes, that was because they ran
out of boiled ham.

02:59.168 --> 03:02.181
What would you like, half a pound
or three quarters?

03:02.183 --> 03:04.169
I'll take half a pound.

03:04.171 --> 03:07.110
Oh, half a pound. Oh.

03:07.111 --> 03:09.123
You don't like your dog any more,
then?

03:11.096 --> 03:14.087
All right, three quarters.
Three quarters. Yes.

03:17.127 --> 03:19.158
Why are you standing like that?

03:19.159 --> 03:23.126
Like what?
Well, like that. You know, like that.

03:23.127 --> 03:24.170
Posture.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.151
Where's your posture, eh?

03:29.135 --> 03:33.093
You're never going to get anywhere
with Madge with posture like that.

03:33.096 --> 03:35.098
I always stand like this.

03:35.099 --> 03:36.340
Get ready for changes, Gastric.

03:39.123 --> 03:42.098
How would you like to look two
inches taller

03:42.099 --> 03:43.183
and be deadly to women?

03:48.091 --> 03:49.108
I can live with that.

03:50.127 --> 03:51.156
I told you.

03:53.099 --> 03:56.147
Go. Go out there
and release your inner beast.

04:00.087 --> 04:02.105
What do we need from the shop?

04:02.108 --> 04:05.162
Oh, I thought I'd just say good
morning, blush a bit,

04:05.163 --> 04:08.098
prod one of his teacakes.

04:08.099 --> 04:10.086
It's called being human.

04:10.087 --> 04:13.138
I can't stand the sight of you
making eyes at each other.

04:13.139 --> 04:15.162
You're going to grow old and bitter.

04:15.163 --> 04:17.136
You'll frighten cuddly toys.

04:21.172 --> 04:23.151
Rawr!

04:35.183 --> 04:38.086
Right, there we go Mr, er...?

04:38.088 --> 04:41.129
Newbold.
Newbold. There's your boiled ham.

04:41.132 --> 04:43.137
But I usually have corned beef.

04:43.139 --> 04:46.117
Oh, we are creatures of habit,
aren't we, eh?

04:46.120 --> 04:49.090
I tell you what. Why don't I cut you
three or four slices

04:49.091 --> 04:51.090
of corned beef as well, hm?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.093
Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't get
through both.

04:53.096 --> 04:55.093
I live alone, you know?

04:55.096 --> 04:57.151
You're never alone with boiled ham.

05:00.132 --> 05:01.161
No Mr, er...

05:01.163 --> 05:03.125
Newbold. Newbold, yes.

05:03.127 --> 05:05.113
Do you know that research has shown

05:05.115 --> 05:08.125
that regular eaters of boiled ham

05:08.127 --> 05:11.153
are 7.5% more likely to find

05:11.156 --> 05:13.177
a suitable relationship?

05:13.180 --> 05:15.153
DOORBELL RINGS

05:15.156 --> 05:17.129
There. Thank you. Oh!

05:17.132 --> 05:21.163
Who can this be, in a collar and tie
and nicely polished shoes?

05:23.148 --> 05:27.101
Oh, Mrs Featherstone.
This is Mr, er...

05:27.103 --> 05:30.137
Newbold. Newbold and he comes from
Crawford Street.

05:30.139 --> 05:35.158
Oh! Well, we're practically
neighbours, Mr Newbold.

05:35.159 --> 05:37.093
I know it's none of my business,

05:37.096 --> 05:40.096
but would there be a Mrs Newbold at
that address?

05:41.168 --> 05:44.122
Not for many a year. I'm on my own.

05:44.124 --> 05:46.177
Oh, courage, Mr Newbold.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.108
Relief could be just around
the corner.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.124
In Denton Street, actually.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.125
Oh, see him scurrying off.
I know the type.

06:04.127 --> 06:06.127
He's mine if I turn the pressure up.

06:07.148 --> 06:10.146
You should snatch me while I'm still
available, Granville.

06:10.148 --> 06:12.137
Ow!

06:12.139 --> 06:15.182
This place could do with
a woman's touch.

06:15.184 --> 06:17.136
Imagine this vision...

06:18.175 --> 06:22.112
Delphine Featherstone is
magnificent in nightwear.

06:28.132 --> 06:30.120
What are you seeing, Granville?

06:34.100 --> 06:35.120
Boiled ham.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.112
Oh.

06:48.091 --> 06:49.122
50%?

06:49.124 --> 06:51.098
Shh. Keep your voice down.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.134
Arkwright, he'll be listening.

06:53.136 --> 06:56.110
I was up all night arguing with him.

06:56.112 --> 06:58.153
How can you argue with the departed?

06:58.156 --> 07:02.146
At 50% off, he comes back
quite readily.

07:02.148 --> 07:04.101
You'll never go through with it.

07:04.103 --> 07:05.165
You'll come out in spots
or something.

07:05.168 --> 07:07.158
Half price is against your nature.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.158
Look, we've got to get rid
of some of this old clutter

07:10.160 --> 07:13.098
to make room for some new clutter.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.160
Er, stock. I meant stock.

07:17.139 --> 07:19.134
There he is again, look.

07:19.136 --> 07:21.096
He was there yesterday.

07:22.115 --> 07:24.113
What have you been doing?

07:24.115 --> 07:25.149
Why me?

07:25.151 --> 07:27.165
Because he could be an angry father.

07:27.168 --> 07:30.124
Have you been fooling about with his
daughter? No.

07:32.168 --> 07:34.110
Anyway,

07:34.112 --> 07:36.091
looks more like a grandfather.

07:41.088 --> 07:42.100
Oi!

07:51.115 --> 07:53.158
CAR HORN BEEPS

07:53.159 --> 07:56.158
It's you, isn't it?
Nurse Gladys Emmanuel.

07:56.159 --> 07:58.146
I've been looking all over for you.

07:58.148 --> 08:00.101
Move along, please.

08:00.103 --> 08:01.141
You remember me.

08:01.144 --> 08:02.156
Michael.

08:07.088 --> 08:08.113
No.

08:08.115 --> 08:09.139
You squeezed my boil.

08:11.088 --> 08:15.146
Move along, please, and go
and be insane somewhere else.

08:15.148 --> 08:17.173
That's it. That's just how you were.

08:17.175 --> 08:20.149
Tough as old boots,
straight in, no nonsense.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.156
I love it.

08:24.175 --> 08:26.093
Move it.

08:26.096 --> 08:27.113
Ha-ha! That's my girl.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.105
Not changed a bit. I love it!

08:29.108 --> 08:30.136
I'll be back.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.148
Oh, goodie.

08:52.155 --> 08:54.124
HE WHISTLES

08:57.159 --> 08:59.114
BELL RINGS

08:59.115 --> 09:00.162
Oh.

09:00.163 --> 09:02.149
Can you quieten that bell?

09:02.152 --> 09:04.131
Come in, Cyril, it won't bite you.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.177
You're not going to die are you?

09:07.179 --> 09:10.173
I don't allow dying on the premises,
you know?

09:10.176 --> 09:12.138
I can't make any promises...

09:12.139 --> 09:15.125
Oh? ..unless you've got a cure.

09:15.128 --> 09:19.177
What have you got for the world's
worst headache?

09:19.179 --> 09:21.173
World's worst headache?

09:21.176 --> 09:23.091
Boiled ham.

09:25.091 --> 09:27.166
I don't want to eat.
I may never eat again.

09:27.168 --> 09:30.142
Oh, it's not for eating.
It's for wearing.

09:30.144 --> 09:32.182
Run that past me again.

09:32.183 --> 09:35.110
Did you say "wearing"?

09:35.111 --> 09:36.149
Yes, wearing.

09:36.152 --> 09:37.177
Boiled ham?

09:37.179 --> 09:41.134
You didn't think that boiled ham was
just for eating, did you?

09:41.135 --> 09:43.153
I've never heard of it
as a cure for headaches.

09:43.155 --> 09:45.177
Oh, yes, yes. It's a well-known fact.

09:45.179 --> 09:47.149
How come I've never heard of it?

09:47.152 --> 09:51.125
Well, you probably were too
engrossed in world affairs

09:51.128 --> 09:53.159
and serious philosophical matters.

09:55.139 --> 09:58.124
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That could be it,
yeah, yeah.

09:59.124 --> 10:00.155
World matters.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.139
Stand there, Mr Newbold,
out of the draught.

10:09.155 --> 10:12.125
This is Leroy, who assists here

10:12.128 --> 10:14.173
when he's not in the hands of
various moppets

10:14.176 --> 10:16.158
training to be single parents.

10:16.159 --> 10:18.142
Good day, Mrs Featherstone.

10:18.144 --> 10:22.110
And this is Mr Newbold, who we've
decided needs to take more exercise.

10:22.111 --> 10:24.097
Is that not so, Mr Newbold?

10:24.100 --> 10:26.134
Bring the colour
back into those cheeks.

10:26.135 --> 10:29.086
And good day to you, Mr Newbold.

10:29.087 --> 10:32.101
You might mention to Granville
that I was passing, Leroy,

10:32.104 --> 10:33.149
in the company of Mr Newbold.

10:33.152 --> 10:35.134
I was going to watch the cricket.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.101
Ooh, I had a husband did that.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.182
He's been dead these many innings.

10:38.183 --> 10:40.128
Not good odds, Mr Newbold.

10:48.104 --> 10:51.182
First of all, you put
a slice of boiled ham, right?

10:51.183 --> 10:54.182
One slice. Two if the pain is severe.

10:54.183 --> 11:00.110
It is, it is. It is severe and I'm
from a warrior race. Yes.

11:00.111 --> 11:03.097
And then you fold it in a piece
of, er,

11:03.100 --> 11:06.120
grease-proof paper, like thus.

11:10.144 --> 11:12.086
And then

11:12.087 --> 11:13.248
you place it inside your hat.

11:15.087 --> 11:17.120
Boiled ham in your hat?

11:19.120 --> 11:21.094
Wait a minute.

11:21.096 --> 11:23.142
I may be inches away from death,

11:23.144 --> 11:25.107
but I'm not falling for that.

11:27.107 --> 11:30.086
Let me refresh your vision, here.

11:30.087 --> 11:32.118
Now, you've seen the television,
haven't you,

11:32.120 --> 11:36.125
all about them distant lands,
great mountain ranges?

11:36.128 --> 11:37.145
Done that, seen it.

11:37.148 --> 11:39.097
Right, OK.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.173
Remote South America...

11:41.176 --> 11:43.142
I know where you're coming from.

11:43.144 --> 11:45.134
Mm. The high Andes,

11:45.135 --> 11:48.138
all those colourful natives, all
wearing hats

11:48.139 --> 11:50.153
very similar to yours.

11:50.155 --> 11:52.091
Even the ladies.

11:54.107 --> 11:58.149
I seen it on the telly,
but what point are we making here?

11:58.152 --> 12:02.145
Did you ever stop to think why
so many hats?

12:02.148 --> 12:06.121
Why do people who
live in mountains wear hats?

12:06.124 --> 12:09.121
You've probably got a branch out
there selling hats.

12:09.124 --> 12:11.118
It is the altitude.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.107
It's the thinness of the air.

12:14.139 --> 12:17.094
Oxygen deprivation.

12:17.096 --> 12:21.111
It gives them all these nasty
headaches unless...

12:24.179 --> 12:27.158
You're telling me that all
the natives

12:27.159 --> 12:30.091
are wearing boiled ham
in their hats?

12:31.144 --> 12:33.107
Even the vegetarians.

12:41.139 --> 12:43.135
Go in peace, my son, free of pain.

12:46.148 --> 12:48.096
Â£3.50.

12:54.144 --> 12:57.097
Nice bit of boiled ham, was that.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.124
It was the last slice.

13:00.096 --> 13:02.114
Before I go back to work,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.182
do you realise we might
just have time

13:04.183 --> 13:07.135
to recapture the magic
of our honeymoon?

13:11.159 --> 13:13.125
Magic?

13:13.128 --> 13:15.101
You got sunburn.

13:15.104 --> 13:18.101
You ended up looking like
a big hot raspberry ripple.

13:18.104 --> 13:19.303
And it's been cool ever since.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.153
You're wasting our best years.

13:23.155 --> 13:26.107
I shan't always be virile
and magnetic.

13:27.131 --> 13:29.173
Eric, you work behind a desk.

13:29.176 --> 13:32.121
You're hardly Captain Midnight.

13:32.124 --> 13:35.142
Sometimes I'd like to come home
and find you all

13:35.144 --> 13:37.121
made up and...

13:37.124 --> 13:38.135
seductive.

13:40.183 --> 13:44.159
You're in insurance. Where do you
come up with fantasies like that?

13:50.128 --> 13:52.110
Will you stop taking
stuff off that table?

13:52.111 --> 13:54.097
You're supposed to be selling it.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.121
I can't let these go, you know,
not at that price.

13:57.124 --> 13:58.162
I told you you'd come out in spots

13:58.163 --> 14:00.169
and I bet you they're all
over your back pocket,

14:00.172 --> 14:02.121
where you keep that wodge of money.

14:02.124 --> 14:03.169
Hey! Shh!

14:03.172 --> 14:06.096
That's classified information, that.

14:07.139 --> 14:10.182
Anyway, what is the point
of having a jumbo,

14:10.183 --> 14:13.097
"everything must go" sale

14:13.100 --> 14:15.173
if nobody has heard about it, right?

14:15.176 --> 14:20.110
So, I want you to take
to the streets, my son,

14:20.111 --> 14:22.149
and wake them all up.

14:22.152 --> 14:26.094
I hate going out in this thing.
It's embarrassing.

14:26.096 --> 14:28.134
It's not compatible with my image.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.090
Oh, really?

14:30.091 --> 14:32.139
This is an iconic vehicle.

14:33.168 --> 14:38.086
You will be taking Arkwright's
to a wider world.

14:38.087 --> 14:42.152
You will be penetrating areas where
no Arkwright has been before.

14:44.148 --> 14:49.100
Though I sometimes wonder whether it
was true about him and Mrs Battersby.

14:50.111 --> 14:51.142
Mm?

14:51.144 --> 14:53.131
He reduced her eggs.

14:54.179 --> 14:56.097
BELL RINGS

14:56.100 --> 14:58.144
All right, you stay there. I'll go.

15:01.148 --> 15:04.128
Hello, Granville.
Hello, Mavis.

15:06.096 --> 15:10.148
I love the way you say "hello".
It just gently strokes the ear.

15:12.148 --> 15:15.134
Oh, I've forgotten what
I've come for now.

15:15.135 --> 15:17.111
Boiled ham.

15:19.128 --> 15:21.182
No, no. Sorry, sorry.
I didn't mean that.

15:21.183 --> 15:24.129
You get a free pass, don't you?

15:24.131 --> 15:26.090
I don't think it was boiled ham.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.110
No, no. No, you didn't.
It was just me.

15:28.111 --> 15:30.166
I just... A slip of
the overzealous tongue.

15:30.168 --> 15:32.168
I don't think it was tongue, either.

15:34.096 --> 15:37.165
What are you doing for
St Darren's Day?

15:37.168 --> 15:39.101
When would that be?

15:39.104 --> 15:41.153
Well, it's today, funnily enough.

15:41.155 --> 15:45.094
It's the day when ladies
wear a flower in their hair

15:45.096 --> 15:49.149
and they place it in a vase in the
best bedroom of their loved ones.

15:49.152 --> 15:51.139
I bet you've not even got a vase.

15:59.183 --> 16:02.162
Now, you used to be a medical person.

16:02.163 --> 16:05.163
Now tell me, what do you think
of his posture?

16:06.163 --> 16:08.149
I'd say it's, erm,

16:08.152 --> 16:11.134
relaxed, borderline sloppy.

16:11.135 --> 16:13.129
Relaxed. That's very me.

16:13.131 --> 16:15.166
You go with what you're comfy with.

16:15.168 --> 16:18.134
All right, all right.
Let's forget the medical viewpoint.

16:18.135 --> 16:20.177
Now, what do you think of him as
like, you know,

16:20.179 --> 16:23.097
man to woman,

16:23.100 --> 16:25.145
potential lover?

16:25.148 --> 16:28.182
I'm not here to be a fantasy
figure for the ladies.

16:28.183 --> 16:32.087
I wouldn't worry.
Some of us can handle the impact.

16:33.172 --> 16:37.114
You could double your impact
if you got your posture right.

16:37.115 --> 16:38.169
Double?

16:38.172 --> 16:42.131
Yeah, treble, if you wore
the right support.

16:44.139 --> 16:47.153
Oh, er, Nurse Gladys, your cheese.

16:47.155 --> 16:50.153
Are you sure you didn't
mention boiled ham?

16:50.155 --> 16:53.159
You're the only one who keeps
mentioning boiled ham.

16:56.176 --> 16:58.138
DOORBELL RINGS

16:58.139 --> 17:02.129
Right, stand there, Mr Newbold,
and find your list for Granville.

17:02.131 --> 17:05.153
Mr Newbold is living just round
the corner from me,

17:05.155 --> 17:07.170
in a female-free zone.

17:07.172 --> 17:11.145
Imagine, a widower in suit and tie,

17:11.146 --> 17:15.112
all alone with his microwave
and his basic laundry.

17:17.124 --> 17:18.162
Brings a tear, don't it?

17:18.163 --> 17:20.117
Mm, it did to me.

17:20.118 --> 17:22.114
Apparently, his daughter is some

17:22.115 --> 17:25.092
sort of groupie
for the Hebden Colliery Band.

17:26.163 --> 17:29.140
He only sees her
if someone needs a new trumpet.

17:31.183 --> 17:33.170
Well, he's worth a few bob, then,
is he?

17:33.172 --> 17:35.162
Oh, yes, in the building society,

17:35.163 --> 17:37.165
aside from his ISAs.

17:37.167 --> 17:39.114
Oh.

17:39.115 --> 17:41.175
In future, I think we'll
keep it in here.

17:42.180 --> 17:45.157
Now, perhaps you left it
on the table

17:45.160 --> 17:49.125
when I said, "Have you got your
list? Don't leave it on the table."

17:49.127 --> 17:51.117
It's here. Ah.

17:51.119 --> 17:52.153
That's a relief.

17:52.155 --> 17:55.144
I thought she were going to execute
you on the spot.

17:56.163 --> 17:57.175
Me, too.

18:00.096 --> 18:01.145
Oh.

18:01.147 --> 18:05.160
Oh, you appear to have a stain
on your tie, Mr Newbold.

18:06.175 --> 18:09.119
Are we being too casual
with our custard?

18:10.180 --> 18:12.125
More likely porridge.

18:12.127 --> 18:14.087
Oh, that sounds healthier.

18:16.135 --> 18:19.114
He wears a tie at breakfast.

18:19.115 --> 18:21.122
Are we being gentrified, Granville?

18:21.124 --> 18:23.134
Is this the beginning?

18:23.135 --> 18:25.130
Well, I wear a tie for breakfast.

18:25.132 --> 18:28.096
Oh, you must allow me
to witness that.

18:29.163 --> 18:32.130
Yes, well, it doesn't get stained
with porridge,

18:32.132 --> 18:35.162
but you'd be surprised how a
shopkeeper gets splashed

18:35.163 --> 18:37.182
during the course of a day.

18:37.183 --> 18:40.092
But what about the night, Granville?

18:41.115 --> 18:44.092
Well, if you want a good splash,
you've got my number.

18:52.172 --> 18:55.115
Yes, I've got your number,
Mrs Featherstone.

19:01.104 --> 19:03.086
Everything must go!

19:03.087 --> 19:06.097
DOGS BARK AND WHINE
The Arkwright jumble sale!

19:06.099 --> 19:08.165
Oi! Come back!
Sorry!

19:08.167 --> 19:11.107
Right, move it, Cindy. Come on,
give it some clog.

19:14.155 --> 19:15.173
Oh.

19:15.175 --> 19:17.170
I'm sorry, but who is this?

19:17.172 --> 19:19.109
I've no idea.

19:19.112 --> 19:22.114
Oh, you can't have forgotten.
It's Mike. Mick!

19:22.115 --> 19:24.097
Mr Stillworth.

19:24.099 --> 19:25.182
I asked you to marry me.

19:25.183 --> 19:29.086
I remember you now. You were drunk.

19:29.087 --> 19:33.092
Oh, you don't think I'm having a
boil squeezed without an
anaesthetic.

19:34.144 --> 19:36.089
Goodbye, Mr Stillworth.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.094
Call me Mick. I'm sober now.

19:38.096 --> 19:39.135
Ha!

19:40.172 --> 19:43.115
What can I get her?
What does she like?

19:49.135 --> 19:50.172
Boiled ham?

20:00.172 --> 20:02.112
Everything must go?

20:03.115 --> 20:05.086
It's nearly gone.

20:05.087 --> 20:07.135
I wish I could say
the same for your Madge.

20:10.087 --> 20:12.182
She's better for knowing.

20:12.183 --> 20:14.096
Or maybe not.

20:15.112 --> 20:17.150
Do you think you'll ever get on,
you two?

20:17.152 --> 20:22.094
We'll just have to convince
her of the benefits of Gastric.

20:22.096 --> 20:25.155
You'll have to remind me.
What are the benefits of Gastric?

20:26.172 --> 20:30.160
Mind you, they do say that
he's handy round the house.

20:33.140 --> 20:36.117
Not much use
if he never gets in the house.

20:36.119 --> 20:37.150
I know the feeling.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.177
I never get inside your house.

20:39.180 --> 20:42.160
She does go out sometimes,
when she's doing hair.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.162
You could come for a coffee.

20:45.163 --> 20:47.137
Oh, unless you'd rather have tea?

20:47.140 --> 20:50.170
No, no, tea or coffee,
I don't mind, no.

20:50.172 --> 20:53.094
Well, now I shan't know
which to offer you.

20:53.096 --> 20:54.145
All right, coffee.

20:54.147 --> 20:58.114
She could style his hair.
That's a start.

20:58.115 --> 20:59.132
Has he got any hair?

21:02.124 --> 21:03.155
There's always a snag.

21:05.163 --> 21:08.117
How will I know when she's gone out?

21:08.119 --> 21:10.170
You'll just have to hope for a sign,

21:10.172 --> 21:13.117
like St Darren's Day,

21:13.119 --> 21:18.117
when ladies wear a flower
in their hair.

21:18.119 --> 21:19.124
Oh.

21:26.099 --> 21:27.102
Sorry.

21:27.104 --> 21:28.127
Don't... Don't be.

21:36.112 --> 21:38.162
Ooh, right. I can't stay
here all day.

21:38.163 --> 21:40.134
I'll fetch sandwiches.

21:40.135 --> 21:42.097
I'm supposed to be out advertising.

21:42.099 --> 21:43.165
We can do that later.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.170
I don't like you being unfaithful.

21:45.172 --> 21:47.173
Leroy, I've never been
unfaithful to you.

21:47.175 --> 21:50.155
Not to me, to your boyfriend.
Oh, him.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.102
Oh. Ooh!

21:55.104 --> 21:57.173
This underwear feels funny.

21:57.175 --> 21:59.150
Yes, well, it's, er,

21:59.152 --> 22:02.114
not yet adjusted
to your shape, is it?

22:02.115 --> 22:04.178
Well, when I get
the perfect posture... Mm?

22:04.180 --> 22:07.162
...what am I supposed to do with it?
Well, you're going to go out there

22:07.163 --> 22:09.150
and parade it in front of Madge,

22:09.152 --> 22:12.178
just to prove that you're not
always looking like something

22:12.180 --> 22:15.092
that's been put out for recycling.

22:18.087 --> 22:21.119
You find a style that suits you
and you stay with that.

22:22.180 --> 22:25.112
And you're going to have to
get a haircut.

22:27.183 --> 22:29.130
Are you sure? Yes.

22:29.132 --> 22:32.162
You've got to let Madge
play with it, you see,

22:32.163 --> 22:36.182
so that you can reel
her in with some...

22:36.183 --> 22:38.125
snappy conversation.

22:38.127 --> 22:41.130
DOORBELL RINGS

22:41.132 --> 22:43.117
Ay up. It works.

22:43.119 --> 22:46.182
Ah, Cyril. Come in. Your hat's in,
why don't you follow it?

22:46.183 --> 22:49.134
I'm not shopping.

22:49.135 --> 22:52.117
I thought I'd pop in
and say it works.

22:52.119 --> 22:53.170
No more headaches?

22:53.172 --> 22:56.134
Gone. I feel like a two-year-old.

22:56.135 --> 22:58.173
Ha, the Aztec cure.

22:58.175 --> 23:02.165
I can't believe it.
I mean, boiled ham in your hat.

23:02.167 --> 23:04.109
In your hat?

23:04.112 --> 23:06.117
I recommend it. It works.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.114
And no side effects?

23:08.115 --> 23:10.107
I wouldn't say no side effects.

23:17.147 --> 23:19.122
I once treated his boil.

23:19.124 --> 23:23.130
Mm. Just goes to show,
you daren't handle them casually,

23:23.132 --> 23:26.089
even for medicinal purposes.

23:26.092 --> 23:27.122
A boil?

23:27.124 --> 23:30.153
Bit slim as grounds for a
relationship.

23:30.155 --> 23:32.094
Tell me about it.

23:32.096 --> 23:35.086
He builds all this on a boil.

23:35.087 --> 23:37.094
It's a good job
I never handled his broken leg.

23:37.096 --> 23:39.170
Oh, you have to feel sorry for him
if he had a broken leg.

23:39.172 --> 23:42.102
Oh, he didn't have a broken leg.

23:42.104 --> 23:45.109
Nurse was speaking hypothetically.

23:45.112 --> 23:47.102
Oh, that was my first thought,

23:47.104 --> 23:49.115
but then I decided, no, she can't be.

23:55.112 --> 23:58.089
Well, I suppose you could take
the view that a boil being

23:58.092 --> 24:00.150
interested in you is better
than nothing.

24:00.152 --> 24:05.105
Boil, something red and angry,
that's a pain.

24:05.107 --> 24:06.137
I think I married one.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.114
Oh, she doesn't mean that.

24:08.115 --> 24:11.086
I do on Mondays.
Why Mondays?

24:11.087 --> 24:13.142
Well, I've usually ruined his
weekend by then

24:13.144 --> 24:15.125
and he's in a foul mood.

24:15.127 --> 24:17.130
They can be tricky at weekends.

24:17.132 --> 24:19.117
The answer is long walks.

24:19.119 --> 24:21.125
Oh, I don't see you as a hiker.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.105
Not me, them.

24:23.107 --> 24:26.163
If you pick the
right route, they come home
shattered and very little trouble.

24:28.119 --> 24:31.109
How can they expect you
to remember a boil?

24:31.112 --> 24:33.145
I wish I had a penny for every boil.

24:33.147 --> 24:36.092
I was sure somebody
said he had a broken leg.

24:40.092 --> 24:41.177
I know they no longer promise
to obey,

24:41.180 --> 24:44.140
but where does it say they
have to be in charge?

24:46.107 --> 24:47.162
Right, stand straight.

24:47.163 --> 24:49.109
I'm standing straight.

24:49.112 --> 24:51.170
It's this underwear
that's slouching.

24:51.172 --> 24:54.086
Ha-ha. Not for long.

24:54.087 --> 24:57.114
Right.
To be honest, I'm a pussy.

24:57.115 --> 25:00.097
Sometimes I think
I ought to be more...

25:00.099 --> 25:01.173
assertive.

25:01.175 --> 25:03.105
So, why don't you?

25:03.107 --> 25:04.162
Because the last time I tried it,

25:04.163 --> 25:06.183
it was a fortnight before
I could sit comfortably.

25:12.127 --> 25:15.107
What's he got up there that
needs inflating?

25:16.175 --> 25:18.140
I were wondering that.

25:22.132 --> 25:25.119
Just squeeze your nose
if your ears start to pop.

25:27.107 --> 25:28.155
Oh, it's moving.

25:31.087 --> 25:33.104
I can't be doing
with wandering underwear.

25:34.135 --> 25:36.180
This was Errol Flynn's
secret, you know?

25:38.147 --> 25:42.112
He never went anywhere without
first inflating his underwear.

25:45.124 --> 25:46.155
Ah!

25:50.155 --> 25:52.094
Oh!

25:52.096 --> 25:54.170
Can you be strangled
below the waist?

25:54.172 --> 25:56.112
Not round here.

25:59.107 --> 26:00.115
There!

26:01.172 --> 26:02.175
Ah!

26:06.087 --> 26:08.104
The perfect posture.

26:09.124 --> 26:11.178
Right, now go out there

26:11.180 --> 26:14.132
and impose yourself upon Madge.

26:16.172 --> 26:18.127
RUBBER CREAKS

26:31.119 --> 26:33.177
Go on. Go get her, tiger.

26:33.180 --> 26:36.096
Go on, off you go.

26:37.104 --> 26:39.092
RUBBER CREAKS

26:42.119 --> 26:45.102
I think you've put too
much wind up him.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.170
If his underwear explodes now,
those ladies

26:47.172 --> 26:50.114
are not going to know where to look.

26:50.115 --> 26:51.182
RUBBER CREAKS

26:51.183 --> 26:54.157
How you doing, Madge?
How you been keeping?

26:54.160 --> 26:57.114
Thought I'd just pop over
and say hello,

26:57.115 --> 26:58.119
as you do.

27:00.183 --> 27:03.132
WHISTLING AS AIR ESCAPES

27:07.127 --> 27:09.173
UNDERWEAR DEFLATES

27:09.175 --> 27:12.183
I saw you talking. I thought
I'd just say, "Hi." Ha-ha.

27:16.107 --> 27:18.114
UNDERWEAR DEFLATES

27:18.115 --> 27:19.142
You'll have to excuse me.

27:19.144 --> 27:21.140
I think my underwear's going down.

27:25.124 --> 27:27.165
AIR ESCAPES LOUDLY

27:27.167 --> 27:29.147
Come on. Hurry up.
Get these off!

27:32.167 --> 27:35.112
Why did you do that, you fool?

27:39.172 --> 27:43.172
'I'm sure there was more air coming
out of Gastric than I put in.

27:45.092 --> 27:48.104
'Oh, well, at least we shifted some
boiled ham.'

27:53.147 --> 27:55.145
Have you seen a dog with a hat?

27:55.147 --> 27:57.087
He went that way.

28:10.147 --> 28:13.109
Is that you wearing a flower, Mavis?

28:13.112 --> 28:15.112
Happy St Darren's Day, Granville.

28:17.140 --> 28:18.167
Coffee time. Ho-ho.

28:20.112 --> 28:22.119
Keep cool, Granville.
