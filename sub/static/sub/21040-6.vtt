You think Dessie Toner
tied Niall Swift up,

and carried him to the cliff edge?

32:06.363 --> 32:08.603
[Cellphone buzzing]

32:22.403 --> 32:23.802
[Beeping]

32:23.803 --> 32:24.962
[Beeping stops]

32:24.963 --> 32:26.443
No!

32:34.363 --> 32:35.963
Kieran?

32:37.723 --> 32:39.402
Kieran.

32:39.403 --> 32:41.922
Evie!

32:41.923 --> 32:43.722
- Shit!
- [Foot stomps]

32:43.723 --> 32:45.643
[Siren wailing]

32:55.323 --> 32:57.042
What is the matter with you?

32:57.043 --> 32:58.442
One minute you're all
for coming to Australia,

32:58.443 --> 32:59.602
and, what,
now you won't even look at me.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.642
I'm not going anywhere.

33:01.643 --> 33:02.643
Why not?

33:05.923 --> 33:08.282
Why are you looking at me like that?

33:08.283 --> 33:10.402
What you did.

33:10.403 --> 33:11.443
What did I do?

33:12.483 --> 33:13.642
Aah. You're hurting me.

33:13.643 --> 33:16.522
Every time I get
a glimmer of hope, he shows up.

33:16.523 --> 33:19.442
- Who?
- My dad.

33:19.443 --> 33:20.883
What are you talking about?

33:22.843 --> 33:23.843
You should go.

33:23.844 --> 33:25.202
No. I want to know what you mean.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.402
Do you?

33:26.403 --> 33:29.323
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.

33:30.523 --> 33:32.962
Why do you have to be like the others?

33:32.963 --> 33:34.562
What others?

33:34.563 --> 33:38.682
Trying to... to burrow into my head.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.202
That body...

33:41.203 --> 33:42.963
that was my father.

33:43.723 --> 33:47.123
But how do you know that?

33:51.403 --> 33:53.282
You killed him.

33:53.283 --> 33:55.043
[Siren wailing]

34:02.203 --> 34:04.722
Have you seen a young girl
with brown hair around here?

34:04.723 --> 34:06.163
Yeah, on the beach.

34:07.843 --> 34:11.562
- Swift, fucking Jonjo.
- EVIE: No.

34:11.563 --> 34:13.282
They all thought they could open me up

34:13.283 --> 34:15.562
and find some little kid
shitting himself in the dark.

34:15.563 --> 34:17.081
No. Jonjo was our friend.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.762
Well, now they're the ones
shitting themselves.

34:18.763 --> 34:19.963
- And, what, Dessie?
- Too easy.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.722
"Bring the gun," I said.

34:22.723 --> 34:24.283
"We'll scare Baxter."

34:25.683 --> 34:29.242
I put the rifle under his chin
for a laugh.

34:29.243 --> 34:30.043
And boom.

34:35.443 --> 34:37.283
EVIE: Help!

34:43.763 --> 34:45.243
- Oh!
- Come here!

34:46.003 --> 34:47.683
Aah!

34:48.683 --> 34:50.083
- Come here!
- No! Stop!

34:51.563 --> 34:53.282
No!

34:53.283 --> 34:57.043
Stop! Stop! Aah! Stop!

35:00.003 --> 35:01.443
Come here!

35:06.283 --> 35:07.283
[Gasping]

35:32.083 --> 35:33.083
[Screams]

35:47.763 --> 35:50.003
No!

35:57.403 --> 35:58.843
Evie.

36:03.243 --> 36:05.043
[Vomiting]

36:08.483 --> 36:10.523
[Coughing]

36:53.283 --> 36:56.923
Can you identify this person by name?

37:02.443 --> 37:04.642
Okay.

37:04.643 --> 37:08.483
If I get any details wrong,
please correct me.

37:09.643 --> 37:14.242
This is your son Jordan Whitehead,

37:14.243 --> 37:15.922
24 years old.

37:15.923 --> 37:19.922
Two years ago,
taking his brother's identity,

37:19.923 --> 37:23.682
he posed as a 17-year-old

37:23.683 --> 37:27.563
to gain entry to Lochnafoy College.

37:37.403 --> 37:38.563
Bea.

37:39.483 --> 37:41.122
Listen.

37:41.123 --> 37:46.323
I know what it's like to pray
for a second chance.

37:49.203 --> 37:53.843
And that's all you wanted
for your oldest son.

37:59.163 --> 38:01.603
He'd suffered so much.

38:02.403 --> 38:06.642
And your youngest son had an aneurysm

38:06.643 --> 38:08.482
that left him paralyzed.

38:08.483 --> 38:11.883
The doctors said he'd never recover.

38:13.403 --> 38:18.243
And you're looking at two wasted lives.

38:21.363 --> 38:26.963
After the Army,
Jordan couldn't get a job.

38:27.923 --> 38:30.202
He was so depressed.

38:30.203 --> 38:33.283
I was afraid he might kill himself.

38:34.243 --> 38:38.043
And it was your idea
to swap their identities?

38:40.083 --> 38:42.803
I wanted him to try again.

38:43.563 --> 38:45.562
Go back to school.

38:45.563 --> 38:47.043
Have a life.

38:50.003 --> 38:51.563
Then his father came back.

38:54.923 --> 38:57.843
I don't know what happened that night.

38:59.403 --> 39:01.402
They argued.

39:01.403 --> 39:03.483
It was hell.

39:06.203 --> 39:08.123
And Jordan killed him.

39:08.963 --> 39:10.643
I don't know.

39:14.363 --> 39:17.043
I think he did. [Breathes shakily]

39:19.843 --> 39:22.643
How well did he know Niall Swift?

39:24.723 --> 39:27.843
Niall gave him a lift
back from college a few times.

39:29.643 --> 39:31.082
Did they get on?

39:31.083 --> 39:34.683
At first, I think so.

39:36.363 --> 39:40.242
But after his father came back,
Jordan changed.

39:40.243 --> 39:42.203
In what way?

39:42.923 --> 39:45.683
He became suspicious of people.

39:46.403 --> 39:49.482
He said Niall's friendship
wasn't real...

39:49.483 --> 39:51.722
that he just wanted
to get inside his head.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.842
QUIGLEY: Then your other son
started to recover.

39:54.843 --> 39:58.562
I didn't know what Jordan
would do if his brother woke up.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.323
So you sedated him?

40:04.363 --> 40:06.683
When I looked at Jordan, I...

40:07.483 --> 40:09.363
I saw...

40:12.843 --> 40:15.083
I was scared.

40:25.883 --> 40:27.242
QUIGLEY: Our divers are still looking

40:27.243 --> 40:29.563
for Jordan Whitehead's body.

40:33.963 --> 40:36.322
That day at the dam.

40:36.323 --> 40:39.843
He shot Dessie first,
then Baxter, then himself.

40:41.803 --> 40:44.042
I think he wanted to stop.

40:44.043 --> 40:48.003
Frame Dessie
for the whole thing, walk away.

40:48.643 --> 40:50.882
Maybe he wanted to stop.

40:50.883 --> 40:54.642
But the truth is, serial killers don't.

40:54.643 --> 40:56.322
Why Swift?

40:56.323 --> 40:58.682
Why Jonjo?

40:58.683 --> 41:01.083
What do we tell people?

41:01.843 --> 41:03.843
[Breathes deeply]

41:07.283 --> 41:10.963
ANNIE: [Sighs]

41:57.563 --> 42:01.642
[Lock disengages, door opens]

42:01.643 --> 42:05.002
ALBRIGHTON: Jordan was
a severely damaged individual.

42:05.003 --> 42:06.282
His father's return

42:06.283 --> 42:10.202
triggers an uncontrollable
emotional response.

42:10.203 --> 42:15.482
And after that, he punishes
anyone who tries to get close.

42:15.483 --> 42:18.122
When he kills, he's in control.

42:18.123 --> 42:19.802
But that wears off.

42:19.803 --> 42:23.763
Then he's
a traumatized 4-year-old again.

42:38.883 --> 42:41.842
- Are you away, then?
- I am.

42:41.843 --> 42:45.002
Look, if you ever want
a transfer to Glasgow,

42:45.003 --> 42:48.162
- let me know.
- [Breathes deeply]

42:48.163 --> 42:50.523
I like it here.

42:51.963 --> 42:54.643
- You take care.
- Thank you.

42:57.923 --> 42:59.763
Want a lift?

43:00.563 --> 43:02.203
If I can drive.

43:11.483 --> 43:13.083
This is a first.

43:14.483 --> 43:15.882
People change.

43:15.883 --> 43:18.683
I also get to choose the music.

43:20.083 --> 43:22.003
Get in before I change my mind.

43:26.363 --> 43:27.803
[Vehicle door opens]

43:30.203 --> 43:31.643
[Engine starts]

43:35.683 --> 43:37.242
You wee thing.

43:37.243 --> 43:40.042
ALAN: Right. For the family in Sydney.

43:40.043 --> 43:41.522
Big daft grins.

43:41.523 --> 43:43.683
- ANNIE: [Chuckles]
- ALAN: One more.

43:44.243 --> 43:46.083
Not that. No, no.

43:46.723 --> 43:48.443
Dad.

43:49.723 --> 43:53.843
Oh, I'm gonna miss you! Mm.

43:55.043 --> 43:56.682
I feel a bit nervous.

43:56.683 --> 43:58.402
After what you've just been through,

43:58.403 --> 44:00.442
- I think you're gonna be fine.
- [Chuckles]

44:00.443 --> 44:02.402
I love you.

44:02.403 --> 44:03.363
Bye, darling.

44:03.364 --> 44:05.962
Right. Goodbye.

44:05.963 --> 44:07.363
- Go!
- Bye.

44:07.443 --> 44:09.443
- Go!
- Bye.

44:10.083 --> 44:12.442
- Be safe.
- Yes.

44:12.443 --> 44:15.562
- Phone me when you get there.
- EVIE: Bye.

44:15.563 --> 44:17.603
[Engine starts]

44:20.723 --> 44:21.843
ANNIE: [Sighs]

44:34.083 --> 44:35.402
ALAN: My first sighting

44:35.403 --> 44:39.322
came while I was steering
my craft off Foyers Point.

44:39.323 --> 44:41.722
I glanced at the monitor.

44:41.723 --> 44:46.362
And there he was,
weighted with curling stones,

44:46.363 --> 44:51.362
ghostly white, swaying
to a music only he could hear.

44:51.363 --> 44:55.907
It was him... the Loch Ness Monster.
