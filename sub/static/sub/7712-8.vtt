WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:01.602
SO THE FIGURES SHOW IMPROVEMENT
RIGHT THERE, MICHAEL.

00:01.635 --> 00:02.636
AND AGAIN...

00:06.840 --> 00:08.809
I'LL CALL BACK.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.578
YOU NEVER CALL BACK.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.713
EVERY TIME
MICHAEL'S IN A MEETING,

00:12.746 --> 00:14.682
HE MAKES ME COME IN
AND GIVE HIM A POST-IT NOTE

00:14.715 --> 00:16.117
TELLING HIM
WHO'S ON THE PHONE.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.119
I DID IT ONCE,
AND HE FREAKED OUT.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.088
HE LOVED IT SO MUCH.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.323
THE THING IS, HE DOESN'T
GET THAT MANY CALLS.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.526
SO HE HAS ME MAKE THEM UP
EVERY TEN MINUTES.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.729
UM, TELL HIM
I'LL CALL HIM BACK.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.131
[laughing]

00:30.164 --> 00:31.132
YOU CAN'T JUST WORK
200 DAYS A--

00:31.165 --> 00:32.133
SORRY.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.434
OH, NO, NO, NO.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.069
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.404
TELL HIM I'M IN A MEETING.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.673
SO...

00:39.707 --> 00:40.741
YOU HAVE TO KNOW
HOW TO WORK THIS.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.476
THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THIS.
YEP.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.811
I CAN GET YOU A TUTOR
IF YOU NEED--

00:43.844 --> 00:44.845
OH...

00:44.878 --> 00:47.848
AH, THIS IS A VERY
IMPORTANT CLIENT.

00:47.881 --> 00:51.552
BUT I HAVE
THE MOST IMPORTANT CLIENT

00:51.585 --> 00:53.087
SITTING RIGHT IN
FRONT OF ME...MY BOSS.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.222
SO I WILL CALL HIM BACK--

00:54.255 --> 00:55.389
OH, NO, NO, NO.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.857
CUSTOMER SERVICE
IS OBVIOUSLY PRIORITY ONE.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.259
YOU TAKE THE CALL.
N...N...

00:58.292 --> 01:00.328
NO, MONEY
ISN'T EVERYTHING, RYAN.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.463
AND YOU'RE MY FRIEND,
AND I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.764
TAKE THE CALL, FRIEND.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.634
I REFUSE. NO.
MY HOUSE, MY RULES--I INSIST.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.801
I INSIST YOU TAKE
YOUR WORK CALLS.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.837
AHH...OKAY.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.072
ALL RIGHT, PAM,
WOULD YOU PUT THE CALL THROUGH.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.075
[grunts]

01:18.712 --> 01:20.814
HIYA, BUDDY.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.817
[piano rock]

01:23.851 --> 01:31.859
*

01:52.880 --> 01:54.448
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST...

01:54.482 --> 01:56.184
I NEVER FELT WELCOMED THERE,
YOU KNOW?

01:56.217 --> 01:58.586
THAT'S, UH...
IT'S SUCH A BOYS' CLUB.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.920
YEAH, I HATE THAT.
GOOD.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.355
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

02:01.389 --> 02:04.158
UM, I AM ON MY WAY TO NEW YORK
TO BE DEPOSED

02:04.192 --> 02:06.927
AS PART OF JAN'S
WRONGFUL TERMINATION LAWSUIT.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.531
THE COMPANY FIRED HER
FOR HAVING THE COURAGE

02:10.564 --> 02:12.166
TO AUGMENT HER BOOBS.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.603
AND THEY DISPLAYED
A PATTERN OF DISRESPECT

02:15.636 --> 02:16.837
AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIORS.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.406
YES, YES.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.608
PAT-TERN.
PATT...ERN.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.510
MY FRIEND FRIEND PAT
TOOK A TURN.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.245
THAT'S HOW I REMEMBER THAT.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.813
COULD WE PULL OVER
AND PUT DOWN THE TOP?

02:25.846 --> 02:28.649
MY...I'M FEELING
A LITTLE QUEASY.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.218
NO, I WANT IT UP.
MY HAIR.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.952
REMEMBER, IT'S NOT
JUST A PATTERN.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.622
IT'S A PATTERN
OF DISRESPECT...
MM-HMM.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.291
AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIORS.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.392
DISREE.

02:38.426 --> 02:41.495
MY FRIEND DISREE
GOT NEW SPECS.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.596
DISREE SPECT.

02:42.630 --> 02:46.300
MY FRIEND INAPRO
DRIVES A PRIUS

02:46.334 --> 02:47.801
WITH HIS BEHIND NEIGHBOR.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.203
DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU?

02:49.237 --> 02:50.538
YEP!

02:50.571 --> 02:52.540
TELL 'EM HOW MUCH YOU'RE
GONNA GET IF YOU WIN.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.807
UH, COME ON, MICHAEL,
THAT'S TACKY.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.643
$1 MILLION!
THAT'S 4 MILLION.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.945
$4 MILLION!
MAN!

02:57.978 --> 02:59.380
THAT IS A LOT
OF GUACAMOLE.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.215
LOT OF THE GREEN.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.416
LOTTA GREEN.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.353
THAT IS WHY I HAVE
MEMORIZED JAN'S ANSWERS.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.554
OH!

03:06.587 --> 03:08.922
AND I'VE ALSO
THROWN IN SOME ERS AND AHS

03:08.956 --> 03:10.724
JUST TO MAKE IT SEEM
LIKE IT'S NOT MEMORIZED.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.725
OH, COME ON.
PERFECT CRIME.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.793
STOP SAYING
RIDICULOUS THINGS.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.262
HE'S JUST GONNA
TELL THE TRUTH.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.630
THE TRUTH IS VERY,
YOU KNOW, COMPLICATED.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.798
SO WE WENT
OVER IT CAREFULLY,

03:17.831 --> 03:19.833
AND--JUST SO THAT WE WOULDN'T
LEAVE ANYTHING UP TO CHANCE

03:19.867 --> 03:20.901
OR MICHAEL'S JUDGMENT.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.237
COULD WE PLEASE PULL OVER
AND PULL DOWN THE TOP?

03:23.271 --> 03:24.638
I DO NOT FEEL GOOD.
MICHAEL, I TOLD YOU.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.574
I'M NOT PUTTING THE TOP DOWN!
I'M GETTING CAR SICK!

03:26.607 --> 03:27.741
OHH, I'M GONNA PUKE.

03:27.775 --> 03:28.642
I THINK I'M GONNA THROW UP.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.978
FINE, JUST A SECOND.
HOLD ON.
[retches]

03:33.347 --> 03:34.848
[loud sigh]

03:34.882 --> 03:36.450
[whispering]
HEY, SCHNEIDER,
REAL QUICK.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.685
WHAT DO YOU CALL
A BUTT LOAD OF LAWYERS

03:37.718 --> 03:38.786
DRIVING OFF A CLIFF?

03:38.819 --> 03:39.987
A GOOD START.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.422
AND I THINK IT'S "BUSLOAD."

03:41.455 --> 03:45.293
YEAH, BUT RICH LAWYERS
TOOK THE BUS.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.528
WHERE'D YOU
FIND THIS GUY?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.796
HEY, THERE HE IS.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.531
HEY, MICHAEL.
JAN.
HEY, HEY.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.266
UH, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.567
I ACTUALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.868
UH, YEAH.
OKAY.

03:54.902 --> 03:55.869
CAN WE TALK
OFF THE RECORD?

03:55.903 --> 03:56.870
AS FRIENDS.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.873
[sighs]
I WOULD LOVE THAT.

03:59.907 --> 04:03.043
JAN...HAS PUT THE COMPANY

04:03.076 --> 04:04.678
IN A VERY TOUGH
POSITION HERE.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.280
NOW, YOU'VE BEEN WITH US
FOR A LONG TIME--

04:06.314 --> 04:07.648
OVER TEN YEARS, RIGHT?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.883
WE JUST WANNA BE SURE
THAT YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING

04:09.917 --> 04:11.785
TO HURT US
WITH YOUR TESTIMONY.

04:11.819 --> 04:12.786
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

04:12.820 --> 04:13.954
ABSO--REALLY, YEAH.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.990
I'LL--I'LL DO ANYTHING
FOR THE COMPANY.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.459
GOOD.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.727
THAT IS GREAT TO HEAR.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.329
IT IS.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.899
GAME, SON!

04:25.933 --> 04:26.867
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S RUN IT BACK.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.603
THE WAREHOUSE GOT
A PING-PONG TABLE LAST WEEK.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.672
NOW JIM COMES DOWN
AND PLAYS WITH DARRYL.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.741
SOMETIMES,
I BRING HIM JUICE.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.676
MY BOYFRIEND IS 12.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.949
WHAT HAS TWO SKINNY
CHICKEN LEGS

04:41.982 --> 04:43.617
AND SUCKS AT PING-PONG?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.353
HI, KELLY.
GUESS WHOSE
BOYFRIEND IT IS?

04:45.386 --> 04:47.621
I DON'T WANNA GUESS.
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

04:47.655 --> 04:48.822
IT'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.325
I THINK IT'S
THE GUY OVER HERE.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.927
I DON'T TALK TRASH,
I TALK SMACK.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.563
THEY'RE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.730
TRASH TALK
IS ALL HYPOTHETICAL,

04:56.764 --> 04:59.500
LIKE, "YOUR MOM IS SO FAT,
SHE COULD EAT THE INTERNET."

04:59.533 --> 05:02.336
BUT SMACK TALK IS HAPPENING,
LIKE, RIGHT NOW.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.472
LIKE, "YOU'RE UGLY,
AND I KNOW IT FOR A FACT,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.006
'CAUSE I GOT THE EVIDENCE
RIGHT THERE."

05:08.008 --> 05:10.944
JIM...CAN I SEE YOU
FOR A SECOND?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.380
SURE.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.849
WOW.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.685
OKAY, IT'S NOT
REGULATION SIZE,

05:17.718 --> 05:18.919
BUT IT'LL DO.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.521
YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.055
YOU HAVE TO GET REALLY GOOD
AND BEAT DARRYL.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.791
OH, I CAN'T BEAT DARRYL.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.925
PLEASE?

05:24.958 --> 05:26.927
KELLY'S TRASH TALKING ME
BECAUSE DARRYL'S BEATING YOU.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.896
WHAT? SERIOUSLY?
WHAT IS SHE SAYING?

05:28.929 --> 05:30.764
YOUR BOYFRIEND IS SO WEAK,

05:30.798 --> 05:32.900
HE NEEDS STEROIDS
JUST TO WATCH BASEBALL.

05:32.933 --> 05:33.934
JIM COULDN'T HIT
A PING-PONG BALL

05:33.967 --> 05:35.603
IF IT WAS THE SIZE
OF THE MOON.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.104
WERE JIM'S PARENTS
FIRST COUSINS

05:37.137 --> 05:38.939
THAT WERE ALSO
BAD AT PING-PONG?

05:38.972 --> 05:41.675
SO YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DEFEND
YOUR HONOR AGAINST KELLY?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.110
SORTA, YES.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.612
BRING ME PLAYERS.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.979
OKAY.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.849
HI, EVERYONE.
DIANE KELLY.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.150
I'M THE COMPANY'S
CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.053
HI. NO, NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.688
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.790
TOBY?
ARE YOU RENEWING
YOUR DIVORCE VOWS

05:56.824 --> 05:57.825
BEFORE MY DEPOSITION?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.393
MICHAEL,
I'M YOUR H.R. REP.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.394
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.930
NEVER.
I WANT HIM...GONE.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.031
I DON'T TALK
UNTIL HE LEAVES.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.933
MICHAEL,
JUST RELAX, OKAY?

06:05.966 --> 06:06.967
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THEY'RE READY FOR US NOW.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.869
SO...
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.971
MR. SCOTT, DO YOU SWEAR
TO TELL THE TRUTH,

06:11.004 --> 06:13.507
THE WHOLE TRUTH,
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?

06:13.541 --> 06:14.875
"YESH."

06:14.908 --> 06:16.109
MR. SCOTT,

06:16.143 --> 06:17.645
CAN YOU DESCRIBE
THE CIRCUMSTANCES

06:17.678 --> 06:19.680
OF MS. LEVINSON'S TERMINATION?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.482
WELL, IT WAS NOT
JUST A TERMINATION.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.852
IT WAS A PATTERN OF DISRESPECT
AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.887
OH...VERY GOOD.

06:26.920 --> 06:27.955
WELL PUT.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.757
PEOPLE
UNDERESTIMATE MICHAEL.

06:29.790 --> 06:30.958
THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS

06:30.991 --> 06:32.793
THAT HE IS WELL
ABOVE AVERAGE AT.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.762
LIKE...ICE SKATING.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.664
HE IS A VERY GOOD
ICE SKATER.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.033
HEY, KEVIN.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.702
JIM NEEDS TO SEE YOU.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.203
ABOUT WHAT?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.939
HE NEEDS HELP BALANCING
SOME TRAVEL RECEIPTS.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.875
ARE YOU SURE
HE WANTS ME?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.878
BECAUSE I HAVE OSCAR
BALANCE MY TRAVEL RECEIPTS.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.846
YEAH, NO, HE ASKED
FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.415
HE'S IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.923
OH, AWESOME!

07:06.927 --> 07:08.862
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
THE PLAINTIFF?

07:08.896 --> 07:11.031
I HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY SEEN IT.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.766
BUT I HAVE SEEN THE FIRM,

07:12.800 --> 07:15.769
AND I AM PLANNING ON RENTING
THE PELICAN BRIEF.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.038
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
MS. LEVINSON?

07:18.071 --> 07:19.106
SIX YEARS AND TWO MONTHS.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.742
AND YOU WERE DIRECTLY
UNDER HER THE ENTIRE TIME?

07:21.775 --> 07:22.976
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.011
EXCUSE ME?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.713
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.981
MS. LEVINSON TOLD YOU THAT
SHE WAS YOUR DIRECT SUPERIOR?

07:28.015 --> 07:31.785
WELL, UH...
WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?

07:31.819 --> 07:32.853
CAN WE JUST MOVE ON
TO ANOTHER QUESTION?

07:32.886 --> 07:33.921
NO, WAIT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.055
WHO'S ON RECORD
AS SAYING THIS?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.590
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I'M THE MIDDLE

07:36.624 --> 07:37.858
OF A LINE OF QUESTIONING.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.026
NOW, MR. SCOTT,

07:39.059 --> 07:40.894
WHAT DID YOU SAY
MS. LEVINSON SAID

07:40.928 --> 07:43.030
REGARDING YOUR
EMPLOYMENT STATUS

07:43.063 --> 07:44.898
WITH RESPECT TO HER
CORPORATE POSITION?

07:44.932 --> 07:46.800
COME AGAIN?
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.801
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.070
IF I MAY, HE WAS JUST
TELLING A JOKE BEFORE.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.905
SO CAN WE MOVE ON
TO ANOTHER QUESTION?

07:51.939 --> 07:54.007
ARE YOU SURE?
UH, YES.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.609
CAN YOU GO BACK TO WHERE
THIS DIGRESSION BEGAN?

07:55.643 --> 07:59.046
"MR. SCHNEIDER: AND YOU
WERE DIRECTLY UNDER HER

07:59.079 --> 08:00.147
"THE ENTIRE TIME?

08:00.180 --> 08:03.050
MR. SCOTT:
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID."

08:03.083 --> 08:04.952
WELL...

08:04.985 --> 08:07.821
DELIVERY'S ALL WRONG.
SHE'S BUTCHERING IT.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.800
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.939
DID MS. LEVINSON EVER SAY WHY
SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BEING FIRED?

08:25.973 --> 08:28.075
SHE THOUGHT IT HAD TO DO
WITH THE TWINS.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.810
THAT'S WHAT I CALL THEM.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.011
CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.680
WHO ARE THE TWINS?

08:32.713 --> 08:34.615
UM, TO BE DELICATE,

08:34.648 --> 08:36.717
THEY HANG OFF
MILADY'S CHEST.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.920
THEY...MAKE MILK.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.121
YOU DON'T NEED
TO GO ANY FURTHER.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.723
HER BREASTS.
YES.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.924
SHE THOUGHT
IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO

08:43.957 --> 08:45.893
WITH HER RECENT
BREAST ENHANCEMENT SURGERY.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.561
YES, AND, FRANKLY,

08:47.595 --> 08:51.231
THE TIMING WAS NOTHING
SHORT OF PREDOMINANT.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.568
WHAT ABOUT YOUR
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP

08:54.602 --> 08:55.869
WITH MS. LEVINSON?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.938
COULD THAT HAVE PLAYED
A PART IN HER TERMINATION?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.240
WELL, IF IT DID,

09:00.273 --> 09:02.843
THEN THE COMPANY
IS BREAKING ITS OWN RULES.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.311
INTERESTING.
HOW SO?

09:04.344 --> 09:07.247
BECAUSE BEFORE
WE STARTED DATING,

09:07.280 --> 09:11.051
WE DISCLOSED
OUR RELATIONSHIP TO H.R.

09:11.084 --> 09:14.922
AND I HAVE THE PROOF
RIGHT...HERE!

09:14.955 --> 09:16.256
[gasps]

09:16.289 --> 09:18.892
OKAY, THE COMPANY
HAS JUST A FEW

09:18.926 --> 09:20.761
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS,
MR. SCOTT,

09:20.794 --> 09:21.795
IF THAT'S OKAY
WITH YOU.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.163
I WILL ALLOW IT.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.998
UM, WOULD YOU MIND,
PLEASE, JUST, UH...

09:25.032 --> 09:26.166
TAKING A QUICK LOOK

09:26.199 --> 09:29.136
AT, UH...
THIS PHOTO, PLEASE?

09:31.972 --> 09:32.840
UH...

09:32.873 --> 09:35.876
THAT IS YOU AND MS. LEVINSON
IN JAMAICA.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.277
IS THAT CORRECT?
UH-HUH.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.079
AND THAT PHOTOGRAPH
WAS TAKEN MORE THAN TWO MONTHS

09:39.112 --> 09:40.948
PRIOR TO THE START
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.650
DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT?

09:42.683 --> 09:46.053
MR. SCOTT, THE TIME LINE HERE
IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.721
PLEASE, WHEN DID YOUR
RELATIONSHIP ACTUALLY BEGIN?

09:47.755 --> 09:50.758
[sighs]
WELL, DEPENDS ON HOW
YOU DEFINE "BEGAN."

09:50.791 --> 09:51.892
I MEAN,
IF IT WAS FROM

09:51.925 --> 09:53.093
THE FIRST TIME
WE SHOOK HANDS,

09:53.126 --> 09:54.394
IT'S LIKE SIX YEARS AGO.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.764
THE FIRST TIME WE KISSED,
IT'S LIKE TWO YEARS AGO.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.065
EXCUSE ME?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.332
IF IT WAS FROM
THE FIRST TIME WE KISSED SOBER,

09:59.366 --> 10:01.068
IT WAS LIKE FOUR MONTHS
AFTER THAT.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.169
COULD WE TAKE
A SHORT BREAK?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.837
NO. ARE YOU TELLING ME

10:03.871 --> 10:06.173
THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO

10:06.206 --> 10:07.340
AND NOT IN FEBRUARY,

10:07.374 --> 10:09.109
AS YOU PREVIOUSLY
TESTIFIED TO HERE?

10:11.044 --> 10:12.179
LINE.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.313
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

10:13.346 --> 10:15.348
HE ASKED FOR A LINE,
LIKE IN A PLAY.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.420
"MR. SCOTT, DO YOU REALIZE
YOU JUST CONTRADICTED YOURSELF?"

10:20.453 --> 10:21.789
"I DID?"
"YES, YOU DID."

10:21.822 --> 10:22.823
"CAN I GO TO THE BATHROOM?"
"NO."

10:22.856 --> 10:23.657
"I REALLY HAVE TO.

10:23.691 --> 10:24.858
I'VE BEEN DRINKING
LOTS OF WATER."

10:24.892 --> 10:26.694
"YOU WENT FIVE MINUTES AGO."

10:26.727 --> 10:27.560
"THAT WASN'T
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.962
THAT WAS TO GET OUT
OF A QUESTION."

10:28.996 --> 10:30.297
"YOU STILL HAVE
TO ANSWER IT."

10:30.330 --> 10:31.431
"FIRST, CAN I GO
TO THE BATHROOM?"

10:31.464 --> 10:32.766
"NO."

10:39.272 --> 10:40.941
GOOD GAME, MEREDITH.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.142
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.243
ALL RIGHT.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.778
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

10:44.812 --> 10:46.914
DWIGHT!
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.682
AS IT TURNS OUT,
ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CLIENTS

10:48.716 --> 10:50.283
IS A PING-PONG MASTER.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.719
AND I HAVE
TO PLAY HIM TOMORROW,

10:51.752 --> 10:53.120
OR WE LOSE THE ACCOUNT.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.122
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT?
WILL YOU HELP ME PRACTICE?

11:01.862 --> 11:02.830
WHAT THE HELL?

11:02.863 --> 11:03.997
I TOLD YOU.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.399
ALL OF MY HEROES
ARE TABLE TENNIS PLAYERS.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.101
ZORAN PRIMORAC,

11:08.135 --> 11:10.738
JAN-OVE WALDNER,
WONG TAO,

11:10.771 --> 11:12.873
JORG ROSSKOPF,
AND, OF COURSE, ASHRAF HELMY.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.776
I EVEN HAVE A LIFE-SIZE POSTER
OF HUGO HOYAMA ON MY WALL.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.745
AND THE FIRST TIME
I LEFT PENNSYLVANIA

11:17.778 --> 11:19.379
WAS TO GO TO THE HALL OF FAME
INDUCTION CEREMONY

11:19.412 --> 11:21.014
OF ANDRZEJ GRUBBA.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.954
JAN AND I HAD AN ON-AGAIN,
OFF-AGAIN RELATIONSHIP

11:26.987 --> 11:29.356
FOR TWO YEARS.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.025
AND I KNOW THIS
DESTROYS HER CASE.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.894
AND I AM SORRY.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.864
BUT I THROW MYSELF
AT THE MERCY OF THE DEPOSITION.

11:36.897 --> 11:37.931
THANK YOU, MR. SCOTT.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.266
THAT'S ALL WE NEEDED
TO KNOW.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.301
WAIT, UM...

11:41.334 --> 11:42.936
WE'D LIKE TO ENTER
INTO THE RECORD

11:42.970 --> 11:45.338
A PAGE FROM MICHAEL SCOTT'S
PERSONAL JOURNAL.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.406
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

11:46.439 --> 11:48.241
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH MY DIARY?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.878
THIS IS PLAINTIFF'S
EXHIBIT 107.

11:50.911 --> 11:56.016
HOLD--HO--
I QUOTE FROM AN ENTRY DATED
JANUARY 4 OF THIS PAST YEAR

11:56.049 --> 11:57.250
"JUST GOT BACK
FROM JAMAICA.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.052
"TAN ALMOST EVERYWHERE.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.254
"JAN ALMOST EVERYWHERE.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.255
"HEE HEE.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.957
"OH, DIARY, WHAT A WEEK.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.759
"I HAD SEX WITH MY BOSS.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.928
"I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
GOING TO GO ANYWHERE.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.096
"JAN WAS VERY SPECIFIC

12:09.129 --> 12:10.864
"THAT THIS IS NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.532
"THAT IT WAS
A ONE-TIME MISTAKE.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.068
"BUT WE HAD SEX SIX TIMES,
SO YOU TELL ME.

12:15.102 --> 12:18.238
I AM DEFINITELY FEELING
VERY EERIE."

12:18.271 --> 12:19.506
IRIE.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.874
IRIE, SORRY.

12:20.908 --> 12:24.177
"MORE TOMORROW.
XOXO, MICHAEL."

12:24.211 --> 12:27.781
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT NEITHER
YOU NOR MS. LEVINSON

12:27.815 --> 12:29.850
CONSIDERED
YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP

12:29.883 --> 12:31.418
IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD,
IS THAT CORRECT?

12:31.451 --> 12:32.820
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO SEE A COPY

12:32.853 --> 12:34.154
OF THAT ENTIRE JOURNAL
BEFORE WE PROCEED--

12:34.187 --> 12:35.222
I DON'T THINK
ANYONE IN THIS ROOM

12:35.255 --> 12:37.224
HAS A RIGHT
TO READ MY DIARY.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.959
IT'S BASIC DISCOVERY.
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO REVIEW IT.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.895
OKAY, LET'S MAKE
TEN COPIES OF THIS DIARY.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.197
UM...COULD YOU
MAKE IT 11?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.199
11, SURE.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.534
AND WE'LL BREAK FOR LUNCH

12:47.567 --> 12:49.402
SO EVERYONE CAN HAVE A LOOK.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.227
[sighs]

13:14.261 --> 13:16.063
CAN I SIT HERE?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.975
YOU KNOW, I, UH...

13:28.008 --> 13:30.243
I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

13:30.277 --> 13:31.311
IN A WAY.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.513
UM...

13:33.546 --> 13:35.215
WHEN I WAS A KID,

13:35.248 --> 13:37.350
MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.953
THEY BOTH WANTED CUSTODY.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.521
AND THEY BOTH ASKED ME

13:41.554 --> 13:44.858
TO TESTIFY AGAINST
THE OTHER ONE IN COURT.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.459
SO, I DON'T KNOW.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.896
I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO GET
DIVORCED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.597
I LOVED THEM BOTH SO MUCH.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.199
HMM.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.867
I JUST WANTED...

13:53.901 --> 13:56.303
[crash]

14:00.107 --> 14:01.875
HOW COULD YOU GIVE UP
MY DIARY LIKE THAT?

14:01.909 --> 14:02.910
I HAD TO.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.244
I'M SORRY, BUT I NEED
TO WIN THIS.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.445
WE NEED TO WIN THIS.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.214
HOW'D YOU EVEN FIND IT?

14:07.247 --> 14:08.949
YOU KEEP IT UNDER
MY SIDE OF THE MATTRESS.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.984
I DON'T LIKE THE LUMP.
I'M REALLY UPSET ABOUT THIS.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.453
ALL RIGHT, I STOLE YOUR DIARY
AND GAVE IT TO MY LAWYER.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.488
YOU E-MAILED
A TOPLESS PHOTO OF ME

14:15.522 --> 14:17.024
TO EVERYONE IN OUR COMPANY.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.058
LET'S CALL IT EVEN.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.626
FINE. I LOVE YOU.

14:19.659 --> 14:20.493
I LOVE YOU TOO.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.030
MR. SCOTT,
WHO IS THIS OTHER WOMAN...

14:23.063 --> 14:25.532
RYAN, WHO YOU
REFER TO HERE

14:25.565 --> 14:29.102
AS "JUST AS HOT AS JAN,
BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY."

14:29.136 --> 14:32.072
NOT A WOMAN, JUST A COOL,
GREAT-LOOKING BEST FRIEND.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.041
AREN'T WE TRYING TO DETERMINE
WHETHER MICHAEL AND JAN

14:34.074 --> 14:35.909
WERE ENGAGED
IN A ROMANTIC AFFAIR?

14:35.943 --> 14:37.210
NOT MICHAEL
AND THIS RYAN PERSON.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.645
[laughing hysterically]

14:38.678 --> 14:40.147
EXCUSE ME.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.949
THIS IS THE WAY I SEE IT.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.951
YES, I HAD SEX WITH JAN.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.919
AND, YES,
I DID CONSIDER JAN

14:45.953 --> 14:47.220
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.490
HOWEVER, JAN CLEARLY
DID NOT CONSIDER ME

14:50.523 --> 14:53.526
TO BE HER BOYFRIEND.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.096
SO HER ACTIONS
ARE COMPLETELY RIGHTFUL.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.298
OKAY, MR. SCOTT, IT'S--
IT'S ADMIRABLE,

14:58.331 --> 15:02.402
THE WAY YOU DEFEND A WOMAN
WHO IS SO OBVIOUSLY AMBIVALENT

15:02.435 --> 15:03.670
ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOU.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.173
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.707
CONSIDERING
SHE CONSISTENTLY GAVE YOU

15:07.740 --> 15:09.509
SUCH POOR
PERFORMANCE REVIEWS.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.411
THAT WAS BEFORE
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.947
SHE WAS GOING THROUGH
A DIVORCE.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.183
AND SHE WAS DRINKING A LOT.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.217
OKAY.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.718
OF WATER.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.088
MR. SCOTT,
THIS IS A...

15:21.121 --> 15:24.557
COPY OF A PARTICULARLY
NEGATIVE PERFORMANCE REVIEW.

15:24.591 --> 15:28.228
WOULD YOU MIND, UH, READING
THE DATE ON THAT, PLEASE?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.665
MARCH 17TH.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.001
AND THAT WOULD BE
A MONTH AFTER

15:34.034 --> 15:36.103
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
BECAME OFFICIAL.

15:36.136 --> 15:36.736
IS THAT CORRECT?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.338
YES.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.107
YOU MAY READ THE HIGHLIGHTED
PORTION OUT LOUD,

15:40.140 --> 15:40.974
IF YOU'D LIKE TO.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.646
"I'M OUT OF CARROTS.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.281
"I'M OUT OF STICKS.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.383
"MR. SCOTT
HAS TIME AND AGAIN

15:50.417 --> 15:53.987
"PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE
AN UNMANAGEABLE EMPLOYEE

15:54.021 --> 15:55.755
"AND A POOR BRANCH MANAGER.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.591
"I RECOMMEND HE BE
REMOVED FROM THAT POSITION

15:58.625 --> 16:01.328
AND REASSIGNED TO SALES,
WHERE HE BELONGS."

16:01.361 --> 16:03.496
MR. SCOTT,
AFTER HEARING THAT,

16:03.530 --> 16:05.332
WOULDN'T YOU SAY
THAT MS. LEVINSON'S JUDGMENT

16:05.365 --> 16:09.136
IS AT LEAST...
VERY SERIOUSLY FLAWED?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.274
MR. SCOTT?

16:19.779 --> 16:21.548
HOW'S IT GOING?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.550
WELL, HE HAS GONE

16:23.583 --> 16:26.319
FROM COMPLETELY HOPELESS
TO SIMPLY MISERABLE.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.688
CHECK THIS OUT, THOUGH.
SPIN SERVE.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.526
WOW, IT WORKS, LIKE,
80% OF THE TIME, SO...

16:33.560 --> 16:34.594
NICE.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.464
SO SHOULD I SCHEDULE
THE REMATCH WITH DARRYL NOW?

16:37.497 --> 16:38.765
I THINK I'M READY.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.500
I'LL MAKE THE CALL.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.536
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.737
DARRYL IS THE CLIENT?

16:47.074 --> 16:48.708
[whispering]
OH, NO, NO.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.711
HE WORKS HERE, DUMB-ASS.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.281
RIGHT.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.682
SPIN SERVE.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.721
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

17:03.556 --> 17:04.557
YOU CAN RESPOND.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.259
JUST REMEMBER, IT'S ALL
GOING INTO THE RECORD.

17:06.293 --> 17:07.560
MICHAEL, I'M NOT
THE ENEMY, OKAY?

17:07.594 --> 17:09.396
DUNDER-MIFFLIN
IS THE ENEMY.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.131
DUNDER-MIFFLIN...

17:11.164 --> 17:14.334
HAS ALWAYS TREATED ME
WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT...

17:14.367 --> 17:15.802
WITH LOYALTY.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.371
THEY WERE GOING
TO GIVE ME YOUR JOB,

17:18.405 --> 17:19.606
AND I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.341
ALL RIGHT, WAIT--
BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER,

17:21.374 --> 17:24.144
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT KIND
OF LOYALTY THEY HAVE, OKAY?

17:24.177 --> 17:26.779
LESTER, PLEASE READ THAT PART
OF WALLACE'S DEPOSITION.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.549
(Lester)

17:32.619 --> 17:34.654
"WAS HE A CONTENDER

17:36.423 --> 17:38.225

17:38.258 --> 17:40.227
I WAS NUMBER ONE
CONTENDER.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.728

17:41.761 --> 17:43.763

18:08.688 --> 18:10.857
I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION,
MR. SCOTT.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.393
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE
WITH MS. LEVINSON

18:13.426 --> 18:15.662
THAT THE COMPANY EXHIBITS
A PATTERN

18:15.695 --> 18:17.730
OF DISRESPECT
TOWARD ITS EMPLOYEES?

18:23.403 --> 18:26.473
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.740
[scoffs]

18:36.516 --> 18:38.218

19:57.730 --> 19:59.832
WHY DID I DO IT?
I DON'T KNOW.

19:59.866 --> 20:03.570
JAN SAID THAT...
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PHOTO...

20:03.603 --> 20:04.637
[snickers]

20:04.671 --> 20:06.573
THAT SHE REVEALED THE DIARY.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.709
BUT SHE ALREADY BROUGHT
THE DIARY WITH HER TO NEW YORK.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.844
SO...

20:11.878 --> 20:14.481
YOU EXPECT TO GET SCREWED
BY YOUR COMPANY.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.884
BUT YOU NEVER EXPECT TO GET
SCREWED BY YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.988

TO SAVE SOME MONEY.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.800

20:33.833 --> 20:36.336
THAT WAS MY CHEAP
SUGGESTION.

20:36.369 --> 20:39.672
CHINESE WAS
MY CHEAP SUGGESTION.
