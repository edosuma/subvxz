00:32.980 --> 00:35.860
<i>All kids are afraid of the Boogeyman.</i>

00:36.580 --> 00:38.700
<i>Henry and I were no different,</i>

00:39.460 --> 00:41.340
<i>even before that night.</i>

00:51.100 --> 00:53.010
- It's the one I wanted.
- You sure?

00:53.090 --> 00:55.690
We can always return it, get something
you want more, like schooI clothes.

00:55.770 --> 00:58.210
I told them you wanted a dirt bike,
but they wouldn't listen.

00:58.370 --> 01:02.170
- Help me put it together, Henry, please.
- Sure, after I use the bathroom.

01:02.250 --> 01:04.569
- Who wants cake and ice cream?
- I do.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.670
- Great job, sweetie.
- Thank you.

01:43.230 --> 01:44.510
Didn't you go to the bathroom, paI?

01:46.190 --> 01:47.230
Yeah.

01:53.230 --> 01:55.230
I thought we talked about this.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.430
You're 11 years old now, bud.

02:00.510 --> 02:03.670
The hallway light burned out again.
Will you fix it?

02:14.300 --> 02:16.300
See? Nothing to worry about.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.680
Dad.

03:37.990 --> 03:41.190
Henry, I saw him.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.270
I saw the Boogeyman.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.710
He is reaI.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.420
No, no.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.840
No.

05:17.470 --> 05:19.830
When the police came, he was gone.

05:21.790 --> 05:23.670
But only for the time being.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.790
Are you still afraid of the Boogeyman?

05:25.910 --> 05:27.540
No, of course not.

05:30.340 --> 05:31.700
I just meant...

05:34.100 --> 05:36.740
What happened to my parents
is still vivid to me.

05:36.820 --> 05:40.820
I'm really sorry, Laura.
No one should have to go through that.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.980
- Henry said that the intruder wasn't caught.
- Yeah.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.980
- Do you and Henry ever talk about it?
- No, no.

05:49.380 --> 05:52.450
We talk around it.
It's what people do, you know.

05:54.770 --> 05:58.090
It's not easy admitting you're afraid
of the Boogeyman,

05:59.050 --> 06:00.890
even to your own sister.

06:02.170 --> 06:04.330
You know, the three months
that Henry's been here,

06:04.410 --> 06:06.530
we've been able to help him.

06:07.130 --> 06:09.410
- If you're open to this program...
- No, it's not...

06:09.490 --> 06:11.770
It's okay, I'm 18 now. I'm fine.

06:14.210 --> 06:15.250
Hey.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.080
I hope I'm not interrupting.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.920
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.320
- I'm here if you need to talk, okay?
- Okay.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.720
- Either one of you.
- Thank you.

06:42.070 --> 06:44.950
I can't even tell you how much I miss this.

06:45.070 --> 06:49.070
Seriously, I have not had
Marsha Marsha Marshmallow

06:49.230 --> 06:51.310
since you left for the clinic.

06:51.390 --> 06:52.710
I meant you.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.190
- You know, us hanging out.
- Yeah.

06:55.310 --> 06:58.510
I knew what you meant.
I just missed Marsha more.

07:00.070 --> 07:04.630
So tonight, your favorite TV shows
Tivo'd and ready to go,

07:04.750 --> 07:06.230
your lasagna,

07:06.340 --> 07:08.780
and I thought maybe we'd stop by the mall
and get you some shirts

07:08.900 --> 07:11.180
that don't have paint
and sweat stains on them.

07:11.260 --> 07:15.140
- I have a job interview tomorrow.
- Already?

07:16.860 --> 07:20.540
- Where? When did you do that?
- It's a printing company in San Francisco.

07:20.620 --> 07:24.020
- Yeah, I applied online at the clinic.
- Wow.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.860
That's great, Henry.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.180
Well, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's perfect. They do lithography.

07:31.450 --> 07:34.410
It's like silk-screen,
but for, you know, posters and stuff.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.610
I mean, the guy saw my work
and he loves it, you know.

07:36.730 --> 07:40.130
He said I could use some of his equipment
for my own stuff if I wanted.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.890
San Francisco's just so far away.

07:43.010 --> 07:46.610
I mean, you would have to live on your own.
You're sure you could do that?

07:46.730 --> 07:48.850
Well, yeah. Yeah, you know.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.610
I mean, I can do it now.

07:51.730 --> 07:55.250
The Hillridge Clinic, it, you know,
really made me a different person.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.760
It would've been nice if you included me
in your decision.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.560
I'm including you now.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.800
No, now you're telling me.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.440
You know, we should go.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.280
I shouldn't have even had this ice cream.
It's freezing.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.240
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
It's just an interview.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.800
We can talk about it when I get back.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.640
Just forget it, okay?

08:27.590 --> 08:29.030
Want some help?

08:35.350 --> 08:37.230
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

08:43.070 --> 08:45.590
What, now you're not gonna talk to me?

08:57.700 --> 08:58.820
Henry?

09:04.980 --> 09:06.100
Henry!

09:20.730 --> 09:22.570
It's okay, it's okay. I'm here.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.320
When did you do this?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.120
While you were gone,

09:46.800 --> 09:48.440
it got really bad.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.880
Every time I closed my eyes,
I could see him.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.680
He's been waiting.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.520
- Waiting?
- For us to be apart.

10:05.070 --> 10:08.150
I always told you
that I could handle it, but...

10:08.270 --> 10:10.830
That you were the one that needed help.

10:17.190 --> 10:18.830
But the truth is,

10:20.110 --> 10:22.270
I don't want you to go, Henry.

10:24.670 --> 10:26.620
I can't do this on my own.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.940
You can call me whenever you want.
You know that, right?

10:46.060 --> 10:47.660
Yeah, I have my cell phone.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.580
That won't do you any good out here.

10:49.700 --> 10:53.650
You're just gonna have to settle
for what us old-timers call a landline.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.090
Cut off from the rest of the world,

10:58.210 --> 11:01.250
no cell phone, lockdown every night.

11:02.290 --> 11:03.850
I'm really starting to reconsider.

11:03.970 --> 11:06.170
Laura, the lockdown
is just an insurance precaution

11:06.290 --> 11:07.730
for the hospitaI proper.

11:07.810 --> 11:12.090
It helps the administration sleep better
at night knowing that the building is secure.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.290
You mean making sure
that crazy people aren't roaming the halls.

11:14.410 --> 11:15.570
Got you.

11:17.680 --> 11:22.120
<i>The night staff is here if you need them,
and you will have phone access 24l7.</i>

11:22.240 --> 11:25.000
What do you say?
You want to see your room?

11:25.880 --> 11:26.920
Sure.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.400
Look, I'II...

11:31.360 --> 11:34.840
I'll check in as soon as my interview
is done tomorrow, okay?

11:36.400 --> 11:37.760
You promise?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.270
On my life.

11:45.790 --> 11:48.190
You know, the people here,
they're just like you and me.

11:48.310 --> 11:50.630
They're not as crazy as you think.

11:51.230 --> 11:54.550
Stay away from me, you crazy bitch!
I'm just trying to urinate.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.830
- Well, Nicky, this is...
- Complete bullshit!

11:56.990 --> 11:58.990
You have to talk to Dr. Allen
and make him call off his henchmen.

11:59.110 --> 12:01.070
I'm sorry, Dr. Ryan.
We just finished her weekly weigh-in

12:01.230 --> 12:02.590
and I found her sneaking in the bathroom.

12:02.670 --> 12:04.710
Okay, let's talk about this later.

12:04.830 --> 12:07.100
Nicky, I want you to stop by my office
in a few minutes.

12:07.220 --> 12:11.220
- But I didn't do anything.
- I know, but I want you to see me anyway.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.900
This is Laura Porter. She's Henry's sister.

12:14.980 --> 12:17.500
- She's going to join our...
- Whatever.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.300
There's really a nice girI hiding inside
of Nicky.

12:20.420 --> 12:23.300
Yeah, well, maybe one of them
should try eating a sandwich.

12:32.090 --> 12:34.970
- I didn't realize bulimia was a fear.
- It's not.

12:35.090 --> 12:37.810
She suffers from a fear of gaining weight.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.250
So this is Henry's old room.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.690
He painted this while he was here.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.290
- Do you want me to take it down?
- No, leave it up.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.000
He always said
when things were too dark growing up,

13:00.160 --> 13:01.920
that you were the one to pull him out.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.160
Funny.
I could say the same thing about him.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.280
Laura, I'm very happy that you're here.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.280
I'm gonna let you unpack.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.800
Then you can meet the other patients
and Dr. Allen.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.960
Dr. Allen?

13:17.120 --> 13:20.160
He's head of the hospitaI
psychiatric department.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.030
I'll see you in group.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.370
Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

14:32.450 --> 14:36.480
Your door was open,
so I just wanted to come in and say hi.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.640
- Hi, I'm Mark.
- Laura.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.320
And this charming guy behind me,
that's PauI.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.720
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.920
- Germaphobe. Don't take it personally.
- Oh.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.200
My light in my closet went out.
Would you mind taking a look?

14:55.840 --> 14:57.080
I got it.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.560
Thanks, bud.

15:01.390 --> 15:04.550
So it looks like we have something
in common, huh?

15:04.670 --> 15:07.110
It's the dark. He's terrified of it.

15:08.310 --> 15:12.110
For me, it's not so much the dark,
it's what lives in the dark.

15:13.070 --> 15:16.110
- You must be Henry's sister.
- Pretty stupid, huh?

15:17.710 --> 15:19.910
Everyone's afraid of something.

15:37.700 --> 15:42.540
Hillridge Clinic, Santa Barbara County,
January 22nd.

15:42.620 --> 15:47.820
Dr. Jessica Ryan's
severe phobia group therapy session.

15:48.900 --> 15:52.810
Dr. Mitchell Allen,
hospitaI administrator, supervising.

16:00.410 --> 16:04.650
I'm afraid of losing controI of my life,
so I cut.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.690
Cut? You mean...

16:08.450 --> 16:10.730
Most people try to deaI
with their emotions internally,

16:10.850 --> 16:12.690
but Alison finds that overwhelming.

16:12.770 --> 16:15.050
It's really more like impossible.

16:15.210 --> 16:20.360
But with one cut,
all the internaI stuff becomes externaI.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.520
I can just deaI with it, you know.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.360
But then if I stop...

16:25.880 --> 16:27.520
I'm afraid to stop.

16:30.920 --> 16:34.560
- How about you? What's your deaI?
- Same thing as my brother.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.200
I saw my parents killed when I was a kid.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.190
The police never found the guy.

16:43.830 --> 16:46.910
Well, you can't catch the Boogeyman, right?

16:48.110 --> 16:50.750
- He hasn't had a problem finding me.
- He?

16:51.390 --> 16:53.590
You continue to see this "he"?

16:56.310 --> 16:58.110
I don't always see him.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.870
- Sometimes you just...
- You feeI him.

17:03.670 --> 17:05.790
I felt him. Here, in this place.

17:05.950 --> 17:09.099
- Alison, that's not constructive in any way.
- What?

17:09.220 --> 17:11.980
We're all here because we have shit
to deaI with from our past, right?

17:12.099 --> 17:14.339
Just because somebody comes
and gives it a name and a face

17:14.500 --> 17:15.460
doesn't mean it's not reaI.

17:15.540 --> 17:18.819
Laura's fear is less ethereaI.
She fears a specific entity.

17:18.900 --> 17:22.380
The clinicaI term is Bogyphobia.

17:22.420 --> 17:25.500
- Bogyphobia? Are you fucking kidding me?
- Nicky.

17:25.619 --> 17:29.060
And here I thought you were suffering
from some serious ailment,

17:29.180 --> 17:30.900
like Easter Bunny phobia.

17:30.940 --> 17:33.330
- You scared of Santa Claus, too?
- Okay.

17:33.410 --> 17:36.850
All right. Are you guys finished here?
Laura? Laura.

17:38.090 --> 17:40.850
- Laura!
- I'm kind of scared of Santa Claus.

17:42.290 --> 17:44.770
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

17:49.450 --> 17:52.130
That's it?
You're just gonna throw in the toweI?

17:52.290 --> 17:55.010
Nicky's right. I'm wasting everybody's time.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.210
Shit!

18:00.040 --> 18:03.360
You know, I've lived with this for 10 years
and managed, you know?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.400
But when you're really alone,
there may come a time

18:05.480 --> 18:08.520
when you can't manage.
Because I know I didn't.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.320
Look, Laura,

18:12.520 --> 18:17.120
my mother spent her entire life
in an institution battling schizophrenia.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.480
And every month,
my dad would take me there to visit her.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.200
It was different then.

18:21.270 --> 18:24.430
It was electroshock therapy
and sensory deprivation.

18:24.910 --> 18:27.030
It turned her into a vegetable.

18:27.670 --> 18:29.990
She would just stare at the wall
and she'd mumble.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.950
It's probably the worst sound in the world.

18:37.630 --> 18:39.430
And then I found out that it was hereditary,

18:39.550 --> 18:42.830
and I was so scared
I was going to become her one day.

18:43.670 --> 18:45.390
UntiI I faced my fear.

18:46.230 --> 18:48.940
- How?
- By studying it.

18:50.580 --> 18:54.500
I became a psychiatrist
because I wanted to understand the illness.

18:55.060 --> 19:01.620
Laura, you just have to expose the fear
and really look at it, and you will get better.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.460
But it's your choice.

19:19.410 --> 19:21.050
Good night, Gloria.

19:22.930 --> 19:24.210
Buzz me out.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.290
See you tomorrow.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.600
- Yo, Mark.
- Yeah?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.920
- The package arrived.
- It did?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.880
- You know, the one you've been waiting for.
- Halftime, all right?

19:46.720 --> 19:48.360
- Thank you very much.
- CooI.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.200
Hey, not on the floor.
I turned the basement lights on.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.480
Yeah. Sure, no problem, man. Thanks.

20:57.930 --> 20:58.890
Hey, ladies.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.640
Fuck, fuck! Ow! Fuck!

22:02.430 --> 22:03.510
Perry?

22:07.420 --> 22:09.500
Hey, I'm still down here!

22:19.780 --> 22:22.100
Hey. Hey!

22:22.260 --> 22:26.980
Hey, I'm still down here!
Hey, I'm still down here!

22:27.460 --> 22:31.180
Hey, I'm down here! Wait!

22:32.570 --> 22:35.210
Jesus Christ! Help me!

22:35.290 --> 22:39.970
I'm down here! Please! Help!

23:24.990 --> 23:26.390
Anybody there?

23:34.870 --> 23:35.990
Hello?

24:07.500 --> 24:11.490
How did he... I mean, you just don't fall
into an elevator shaft.

24:11.650 --> 24:12.970
You do if it's dark
and you're baked out of your mind

24:13.050 --> 24:15.530
on Perry's hydroponic pick of the day.

24:17.250 --> 24:21.010
Sorry, I don't mean to state the obvious,

24:23.130 --> 24:24.570
but wasn't Mark afraid of the dark?

24:24.690 --> 24:28.170
The police think
that Mark's fear instigated his fall.

24:28.290 --> 24:31.490
He turned off the lights
to avoid being caught.

24:31.610 --> 24:33.970
And once it was dark, he panicked.

24:37.080 --> 24:38.200
Wait.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.240
But I heard Gloria tell the police
that he was

24:44.600 --> 24:46.240
cut in half.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.880
I mean,
that doesn't sound like an accident to me.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.600
Apparently, he tried to climb out
of the elevator shaft,

24:51.720 --> 24:56.200
but he only got halfway into the basement
before the car came down on him.

24:57.640 --> 24:58.760
Every time I think about it,

24:58.840 --> 25:01.790
- and all the blood that...
- Whose chair is this?

25:04.950 --> 25:07.070
Doctor, this isn't my chair.
This isn't my chair!

25:07.150 --> 25:09.230
- Who stole my chair?
- PauI...

25:09.350 --> 25:13.310
- Who stole it?
- PauI. Right over here. Is that it, there?

25:17.390 --> 25:18.670
You've got to breathe.
You need to breathe.

25:18.750 --> 25:21.150
Okay, wait.
Here, here, let me feeI. Come on.

25:21.230 --> 25:22.510
Here's your hand soap.
Get in your seat.

25:22.630 --> 25:24.310
Here, I've got it right here.

25:24.430 --> 25:27.060
Here, let me help you.
Let me get that off there.

25:27.140 --> 25:30.820
Mark was the only one
who actually believed I could get better.

25:30.940 --> 25:32.900
He made me believe it, too.

25:33.020 --> 25:35.100
We'll take as much time as is needed

25:35.260 --> 25:38.260
- for you to absorb Mark's accident.
- No, don't.

25:38.420 --> 25:40.980
It doesn't sound like an accident to me.

25:42.380 --> 25:45.220
I think somebody else turned the lights off.

25:47.860 --> 25:49.380
Like who, Laura?

25:55.130 --> 25:57.490
- Maybe it was the Boogeyman?
- Nicky.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.730
Maybe it was.

26:13.050 --> 26:16.090
- This is counterproductive.
- Counterproductive?

26:16.600 --> 26:20.400
Laura has as much right as anyone
to share her fear with the group.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.760
I'm sorry.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.640
Let's reconvene later today, okay?

26:24.920 --> 26:27.360
Hey, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Who's dead?

26:27.520 --> 26:32.920
Mark fell into an elevator shaft.
I think maybe somebody killed him.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.720
- Henry?
- Yeah, I'm here.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.750
Look, I've been driving all night
and I just got to my interview.

26:42.870 --> 26:45.910
I'll head straight back there
the second I'm done.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.950
You don't believe me?

26:48.070 --> 26:49.990
I didn't say that. I just...

26:50.070 --> 26:52.190
<i>Look, I've been there.
Whenever something bad happened,</i>

26:52.310 --> 26:55.470
<i>I thought he was coming back to finish
what he started when we were kids.</i>

26:55.590 --> 26:58.830
Yeah, but now you're ready to leave
the past behind and throw me away with it.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.270
- No, Laura...
- Yeah, I've got to go.

27:01.430 --> 27:03.790
Look, if I drive through the night,
I'll make it there by 5:00 a. m.

27:03.910 --> 27:06.150
- Just sit tight, okay?
- Hurry.

27:33.250 --> 27:37.890
I had maintenance fix that for you.
I'm sorry if you were upset this afternoon.

27:37.970 --> 27:40.090
- I didn't intend...
- I'm fine.

27:41.570 --> 27:44.010
I'm leaving tomorrow morning, anyways.

27:44.770 --> 27:47.570
What you fear doesn't live inside
that closet, Laura.

27:47.650 --> 27:49.010
It lives inside you.

27:49.130 --> 27:52.410
Can you remove it surgically
or do I need an exorcism?

27:54.970 --> 27:58.360
You know, we've always struggled

27:59.720 --> 28:02.080
to understand the darkness within us.

28:02.200 --> 28:05.680
Fears and anxieties buried so deeply

28:07.160 --> 28:08.840
that they're just too painfuI to face.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.840
And you think my darkness
is the Boogeyman.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.800
But how does that describe
what I've seen with my own eyes,

28:15.880 --> 28:18.880
what other kids have seen
throughout history?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.160
Well, it's a common scapegoat.

28:21.870 --> 28:25.590
Our society will always find a way
to externalize.

28:26.190 --> 28:28.710
Every culture around the world
has a name for him.

28:28.830 --> 28:32.030
The words sound different,
but they all describe the same being.

28:32.150 --> 28:34.190
How does your theory account for that?

28:34.310 --> 28:36.750
We're all afraid of the same thing.

28:36.870 --> 28:41.430
The Boogeyman, germaphobia,
they're all masks.

28:41.550 --> 28:45.350
Masks that we create to hide

28:45.510 --> 28:47.780
what we're truly afraid of.

28:47.940 --> 28:50.460
What do you think I'm truly afraid of?

28:54.660 --> 28:55.780
Well,

28:56.940 --> 29:00.700
if you're willing to stay,
willing to accept

29:00.820 --> 29:05.260
that your fear comes from within,
maybe we'll find out.

29:16.890 --> 29:18.330
Hello, Jessica.

29:20.210 --> 29:22.450
I didn't know you were still here.

29:22.570 --> 29:25.490
I'm thinking about staying overnight,
actually.

29:26.490 --> 29:29.610
We're short-staffed
now that Perry's been fired,

29:29.690 --> 29:33.010
and I'm really concerned how everyone's
been affected by Mark's death.

29:35.210 --> 29:36.520
Jessica,

29:38.600 --> 29:42.840
the board's gonna have a lot of questions
about what happened here today.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.120
Mark's accident has nothing to do
with my program.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.600
Your program?

29:49.480 --> 29:51.040
Your experiment.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.920
The board has always thought

29:54.000 --> 29:58.480
that putting this particular group
of patients together was a mistake.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.590
And, quite frankly,
I'm beginning to agree with them.

30:01.710 --> 30:03.870
I'm really sorry to hear that.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.160
- I'm sorry.
- Get the fuck out now!

32:16.180 --> 32:18.740
Christ! Watch where you're going.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.220
Do me a favor.
Walk with me and follow me to my room.

32:29.940 --> 32:33.010
- No, thanks, I'll pass.
- Come on, I'll owe you one.

32:54.330 --> 32:57.760
Common sense dictates I shouldn't ask,
but what's the bucket for?

32:57.920 --> 33:00.560
We all have our own way of dealing
with Mark's death.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.560
Isn't that why you went off on Henry earlier?

33:05.480 --> 33:07.720
No, but thanks for listening in.

33:11.440 --> 33:14.160
Henry always said you were the reason
he wanted to get better

33:14.320 --> 33:16.640
because he didn't want to hold you back.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.680
- He told you that?
- Every day he was here.

33:25.710 --> 33:28.950
I never meant to hurt him. It's just...

33:33.270 --> 33:34.710
You and Darren?

33:36.150 --> 33:37.910
Once upon a time.

33:37.990 --> 33:40.550
What? And he's in here

33:40.630 --> 33:42.390
because he's afraid of being
anything but an asshole?

33:42.550 --> 33:46.700
Agoraphobic.
Completely terrified of the outside world.

33:48.540 --> 33:51.580
You'd never know by looking at him,
though, right?

33:52.460 --> 33:55.020
He's cute. I see why you fell for him.

33:57.460 --> 33:59.820
Yeah, well, don't think that just
because he pays you a little attention,

33:59.900 --> 34:00.940
he's actually interested in you.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.780
- Nicky, I was just saying...
- Will you just leave?

34:03.380 --> 34:04.460
- Nicky.
- I want to be alone.

34:04.580 --> 34:08.260
- Just leave me alone, okay? Get out!
- I'm not even interested.

34:24.449 --> 34:25.570
PauI?

34:31.010 --> 34:34.090
- PauI, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

34:34.690 --> 34:38.600
- We missed you at dinner.
- Yeah, well, you see this mess.

34:47.159 --> 34:50.679
Well, if you wanna talk,
I'll be in my room, okay?

37:51.450 --> 37:52.690
Hey, PauI?

37:53.450 --> 37:54.570
PauI?

37:57.280 --> 37:59.160
- Oh, God!
- Get help now!

37:59.640 --> 38:01.080
Come on, buddy.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.800
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.880
Oh, Jesus Christ!

38:13.040 --> 38:14.280
Get help!

38:14.440 --> 38:17.120
- I think he's dead.
- What happened?

38:17.200 --> 38:20.640
Call down to the hospitaI.
I want some paramedics up here.

38:43.590 --> 38:45.190
He must've swallowed it.

38:45.270 --> 38:48.180
Like... What? You mean, like, on purpose?

38:48.300 --> 38:50.100
You think he killed...

39:03.780 --> 39:06.140
The phones are dead. I can't get a diaI tone.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.940
I can't get a pulse.

39:10.220 --> 39:11.530
Jesus Christ!

39:13.730 --> 39:14.810
Go down to the hospitaI.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.370
- I want you to find somebody.
- No, it's not happening.

39:16.490 --> 39:17.970
We can't buzz open the doors
with no phones.

39:18.090 --> 39:19.690
Well, doesn't somebody have a key?

39:19.810 --> 39:22.810
- Dr. Allen has an overriding key.
- There has to be an emergency exit.

39:22.930 --> 39:24.930
Do you know how much older this place is
than the actuaI hospitaI?

39:25.050 --> 39:27.650
I'm sorry, so you're telling me
that we're stuck here untiI the morning,

39:27.770 --> 39:29.130
untiI Dr. Allen comes?

39:29.210 --> 39:33.410
- No! No, there's no way! We have to get out!
- Alison! Alison!

39:33.530 --> 39:36.400
I'm sure that the phones
are only out temporarily, okay?

39:36.520 --> 39:38.880
Hey, Henry will be here at 5:00 at the latest.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.840
He will get someone
to open those doors, okay?

39:40.920 --> 39:42.960
Laura, take everybody down to the rec room.

39:43.040 --> 39:47.280
Okay. Okay, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.080
I need you to help me cover him up.

39:59.200 --> 40:02.910
Okay, let's just...
Let's just leave him right here, okay?

40:03.030 --> 40:05.230
Go ahead. You check on the kids.

40:09.270 --> 40:12.030
Jesus, PauI, what the hell happened to you?

40:33.660 --> 40:35.140
It's still out.

40:35.740 --> 40:38.540
Somebody is bound
to pass by sooner or later.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.820
Why don't you go down to the basement
and check the computer system?

40:46.940 --> 40:48.980
It integrates the phone lines
with the security system.

40:49.100 --> 40:50.940
Maybe it just went offline.

40:53.450 --> 40:56.690
- I'd really appreciate your help.
- Okay.

40:59.970 --> 41:01.490
If I see someone, I'll flag them down.

41:03.930 --> 41:05.730
How're you holding up?

41:10.330 --> 41:12.730
What was it that PauI drank?

41:12.810 --> 41:17.480
It was this mixture that he made
out of industriaI-strength cleaners

41:17.560 --> 41:20.520
'cause he couldn't find one
that was strong enough.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.800
Why would PauI have a cockroach problem?

41:23.040 --> 41:24.560
Oh, he wouldn't.

41:25.160 --> 41:28.520
He kept all his food
in one of those airtight things.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.320
No, no, I know, but there was a cockroach.
It crawled under his bed.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.960
I mean, there's food all over his floor.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.960
Well, that's not like him.

41:39.120 --> 41:42.190
No, food attracts bugs,
and bugs have germs.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.630
And he would've been terrified
at the thought of it.

41:47.710 --> 41:49.950
Just like Mark would've been terrified
of a dark basement.

41:50.070 --> 41:51.990
Wait. You actually think she makes sense?

41:52.110 --> 41:55.590
Well, nothing that's happened in the past
24 hours really makes sense, Nicky.

41:55.750 --> 41:57.990
Jesus Christ, what does it matter?

41:58.110 --> 42:00.150
PauI killed himself, someone killed PauI.

42:00.270 --> 42:02.550
Either way, it's just one less person
whining in group tomorrow.

42:02.670 --> 42:05.350
You know, you might want to watch
how hard you sell that!

42:05.470 --> 42:08.620
And what the fuck were you doing
in his room, anyway, Darren?

42:08.740 --> 42:12.260
It was him.
I saw him in the hallway earlier, okay?

42:13.100 --> 42:15.940
- He preys on our fears.
- That's it, I'm out of here.

42:20.340 --> 42:23.420
It's what he does. He knows what scares us.

42:36.730 --> 42:37.850
Gloria?

42:39.410 --> 42:40.570
Gloria!

42:46.250 --> 42:47.930
Hey, any luck with the phones?

42:48.090 --> 42:50.530
Gloria's in the basement.
She's reconnecting the system.

42:50.650 --> 42:54.010
- Have you seen Darren or Nicky?
- A few minutes ago. Why?

42:55.410 --> 42:59.240
- It's not important. Get some rest.
- Okay.

43:05.720 --> 43:06.840
Gloria?

43:21.830 --> 43:22.950
Gloria?

43:42.870 --> 43:43.830
God.

44:13.090 --> 44:14.370
Oh, my God.

44:21.130 --> 44:22.450
Who is that?

44:30.050 --> 44:31.250
God, no, please.

44:31.330 --> 44:32.490
Please. No!

44:45.320 --> 44:46.720
Someone there?

44:47.720 --> 44:49.080
It's just me.

44:49.200 --> 44:53.280
- What the fuck are you doing in here?
- I don't know where else to go.

44:54.880 --> 44:56.360
What are you talking about?

44:56.480 --> 44:58.360
Mark and PauI are dead.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.200
Yeah. I was there, remember?

45:02.830 --> 45:04.470
I know you, Darren.

45:06.470 --> 45:09.750
Come on, it must have been terrible
finding PauI like that.

45:09.870 --> 45:12.270
But you can't keep shutting me out.

45:15.310 --> 45:17.950
You're the only person here that I trust.

45:20.430 --> 45:22.950
Why did you end up hating me so much?

45:23.070 --> 45:25.990
- Huh? What did I do?
- You didn't do anything, Nicky.

45:30.420 --> 45:32.620
Then it's the way that I look?

45:37.980 --> 45:39.500
Did I... Did I get too thin?

45:39.620 --> 45:42.300
- I'm the one with the problem, not you.
- Bullshit!

45:42.420 --> 45:44.300
Nicky, what I'm dealing with,

45:45.580 --> 45:49.380
it's not just being afraid
of the outside world. You know, it's...

45:52.090 --> 45:54.250
It's the people out there, too.

46:01.370 --> 46:03.690
So you don't think I'm disgusting?

46:10.610 --> 46:12.810
I'm agoraphobic, I'm not blind.

48:43.710 --> 48:44.790
Alison?

48:48.580 --> 48:50.260
Hey, are you awake?

49:07.860 --> 49:09.420
Oh, my God!

49:14.810 --> 49:17.330
Alison, Alison. Oh, my God!

49:19.290 --> 49:21.290
Help! Nicky!

49:22.650 --> 49:25.610
Somebody! Help!

49:26.250 --> 49:27.730
Nicky!

49:27.850 --> 49:29.770
Somebody, help!

49:30.610 --> 49:31.690
Nicky!

49:33.970 --> 49:35.330
Let me in!

49:38.400 --> 49:42.000
Come on! Is somebody out there? Please!

49:46.160 --> 49:48.240
- What was that?
- I don't know.

49:49.880 --> 49:51.320
Anybody!

49:51.440 --> 49:54.080
Laura! What's wrong?

49:54.200 --> 49:56.120
Somebody killed Alison.
Come on, we have to find Dr. Ryan.

49:56.240 --> 49:57.520
What are you talking about?

49:57.640 --> 50:00.320
- What's going on?
- Alison's dead. Somebody cut her open.

50:00.440 --> 50:03.830
- Where's Dr. Ryan?
- I don't know. Everybody's gone.

50:03.950 --> 50:05.750
Come on, I'll show you!

50:07.150 --> 50:08.470
Right here.

50:15.230 --> 50:17.350
There was blood everywhere.

50:20.190 --> 50:23.070
- He must've cleaned it up.
- Who cleaned it up?

50:24.550 --> 50:26.580
- It was...
- Who, Laura?

50:26.740 --> 50:31.340
Alison was Iying in this bed.
Her arms were cut to shreds.

50:31.460 --> 50:33.220
She was probably in the middle
of one of her cutting sessions,

50:33.340 --> 50:34.260
and you interrupted her.

50:34.340 --> 50:36.500
There were maggots crawling out
from underneath her skin.

50:36.620 --> 50:38.780
It was like she was trying to cut them out.

50:38.820 --> 50:41.380
You know what? Just stop. Where's Alison?

50:43.620 --> 50:46.660
- I just told you.
- No! No, where's Alison, really?

51:01.250 --> 51:02.370
Hello!

51:02.970 --> 51:06.930
I already checked up here.
Everyone is missing.

51:09.290 --> 51:11.570
She's right. I don't see anybody.

51:16.280 --> 51:17.800
Gloria went down to the basement
a couple of hours ago

51:17.920 --> 51:19.840
to fix the phone system.
Maybe she's still down there.

51:19.920 --> 51:22.200
It doesn't take a couple of hours
to restart a computer.

51:22.320 --> 51:24.840
Hey, guys, Dr. Allen didn't sign out.

51:27.960 --> 51:30.560
Hey, what Laura said about people
being forced to face their fears,

51:30.680 --> 51:31.640
who did that sound like?

51:31.720 --> 51:33.800
You don't think
that Dr. Allen could be behind this, do you?

51:33.920 --> 51:36.360
He's been fucking sadistic lately.
Look at the way he treated Laura.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.880
No. He was just afraid
we'd all start buying into her theory.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.480
Maybe he was afraid I was right.

51:40.560 --> 51:43.630
Okay, what about the time he locked Henry
in the closet?

51:43.790 --> 51:44.670
What?

51:44.750 --> 51:46.710
He refused to let him out
untiI he faced his fears.

51:46.830 --> 51:48.710
Come on, you know him
and all of his "darkness within" bullshit!

51:48.830 --> 51:50.590
Look. Okay, I'm the first one
to bash on Dr. Allen,

51:50.670 --> 51:52.430
but he wouldn't do something like this.

51:52.510 --> 51:54.950
What else did he make Henry do?

51:55.070 --> 51:57.790
Help! Somebody get us the fuck out of here!

52:12.500 --> 52:14.340
Keys, keys, keys, keys.

52:44.210 --> 52:46.490
<i>"Patient suffers
from delusions and hallucinations</i>

52:46.570 --> 52:48.370
<i>"related to his childhood fear.</i>

52:48.450 --> 52:51.090
<i>"Experiences blackouts similar to those
of previous patients,</i>

52:51.210 --> 52:55.130
<i>"in which she has no recollection
of her violent behavior.</i>

52:55.210 --> 52:58.960
<i>"Patient is once again unable
to differentiate his own personality</i>

52:59.080 --> 53:01.360
<i>"from the one he has created
for the Boogeyman.</i>

53:01.480 --> 53:05.640
<i>"Refuses to accept blame
for the crimes he has committed. "</i>

53:17.400 --> 53:18.720
Oh, my God.

53:24.630 --> 53:25.670
Shit!

53:32.830 --> 53:34.150
Who's there?

53:41.670 --> 53:42.750
Nicky?

53:46.070 --> 53:48.780
She's out here, Darren.

53:48.900 --> 53:51.220
- What's that?
- I found it in Dr. Allen's office.

53:51.340 --> 53:53.100
- Any keys?
- No.

53:53.220 --> 53:55.740
But you're right
about Dr. Allen being sadistic.

53:55.820 --> 53:58.340
Before he came to the Hillridge Clinic,
he treated others like me.

53:58.460 --> 54:01.300
- One was this guy, Tim Jensen.
- So?

54:01.420 --> 54:04.380
One night, Jensen killed a bunch of people,
claimed the Boogeyman did it.

54:04.460 --> 54:06.340
What?
Like a split personality or something?

54:06.460 --> 54:08.580
That's what Dr. Allen thought.

54:09.460 --> 54:12.250
Jensen ended up killing himself
under Dr. Allen's care.

54:12.370 --> 54:16.930
I mean, he almost lost his license over it.
He's just as afraid as the rest of us.

54:17.050 --> 54:19.810
He's terrified that he's been wrong
about the Boogeyman all along.

54:19.930 --> 54:21.570
And then you show up.

54:21.650 --> 54:24.650
Allen's bad memories resurface
and people start dying, right?

54:24.730 --> 54:26.050
Fuck this!

54:27.010 --> 54:28.410
Darren, wait!

54:34.610 --> 54:36.800
Darren! Darren, stop it!

54:36.920 --> 54:39.800
Both of you just get the fuck
away from me!

54:47.240 --> 54:48.400
Darren!

54:50.640 --> 54:52.240
Darren, calm down!

54:52.360 --> 54:54.120
- Leave me alone!
- Darren! Listen!

54:54.280 --> 54:57.200
We need to fix the computers
in the basement so we can get out of here.

54:57.320 --> 54:58.760
You think someone wants to kill us?

54:58.840 --> 55:00.480
It could be Dr. Allen
or it could be either one of you.

55:00.600 --> 55:02.910
I'm gonna lock myself in my room
untiI the morning staff gets here, okay?

55:03.030 --> 55:05.990
- Problem solved.
- I want to stay with you. Okay?

55:07.390 --> 55:10.430
You guys, please.
I can't go down there by myself.

56:16.090 --> 56:17.760
What are you doing?

56:17.880 --> 56:20.800
The second somebody shows up,
I am out of here.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.920
You can't just leave.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.360
Watch me.

56:28.040 --> 56:31.760
- Where are we gonna go?
- "We," Nicky?

56:31.880 --> 56:34.760
I've got news for you, there's no "we".

56:36.640 --> 56:39.280
I thought things were gonna be different
this time.

56:39.400 --> 56:43.590
Darren, look, I know what happened
between us scares you, okay?

56:43.670 --> 56:45.030
No, no, no! You don't know.

56:45.150 --> 56:47.510
See that's the problem is
you think you know.

56:47.630 --> 56:50.710
You think you know me. You think
you have me all figured out, right?

56:50.790 --> 56:54.430
You have no idea
what kind of person I really am.

56:55.110 --> 56:58.070
You know, Nicky,
you're always so worried about fixing me.

56:58.150 --> 57:00.310
Why don't you try fixing yourself first, huh?

57:00.430 --> 57:01.590
- Take a good look at yourself.
- Don't!

57:01.710 --> 57:04.110
- Try fixing yourself!
- Don't, Darren!

57:05.150 --> 57:07.100
You know what?
Just get the fuck out of here.

57:07.180 --> 57:08.340
- Just get the fuck out.
- What?

57:08.460 --> 57:11.300
Just get the fuck out of my room!

57:11.420 --> 57:14.220
- And stop being so fucking pathetic!
- You're hurting me!

57:14.340 --> 57:15.740
DeaI with it!

57:18.900 --> 57:21.220
You're Iying to yourself, Darren.

57:22.500 --> 57:24.500
You'll end up dead on the inside.

57:24.780 --> 57:27.180
One day, your heart's
just gonna shriveI up and rot away

57:27.300 --> 57:30.620
before you ever have the chance
to share it with someone.

58:22.910 --> 58:23.990
Fuck!

59:31.730 --> 59:35.210
<i>I didn't want to hurt Nicky.
I was just so fucking scared.</i>

59:41.560 --> 59:44.560
<i>She said that she loved me and...</i>

59:46.760 --> 59:49.440
<i>And I just... I felt like I couldn't breathe.</i>

59:56.440 --> 59:58.800
<i>Well, this is how we do it, Darren.</i>

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:05.510
<i>We conquer our fears
by facing them head-on.</i>

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:11.350
No fucking way.

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:18.190
<i>Your reaction, I think,
tells us something about your illness.</i>

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:24.910
<i>I suspect what you're truly afraid of
is opening up.</i>

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:41.340
<i>Fearful that if you do,
she'll rip your heart right out.</i>

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:43.030
Darren!

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.140
No!

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:03.700
Help!

01:09:01.899 --> 01:09:04.899
Dr. Ryan? It's him.

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.020
He is reaI.

01:09:08.779 --> 01:09:10.140
Oh, my God.

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:13.010
What did he do?

01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:18.850
He is reaI.

01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:22.609
- He is reaI.
- Just like your mother.

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:25.250
He is reaI.

01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:27.210
He's reaI.

01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:30.569
You have to be quiet.
You have to be quiet. Please.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:35.290
You have to be quiet. He's gonna find us.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.160
He is reaI.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.960
I'm sorry.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.840
I'm sorry.

01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:45.210
Dr. Allen, how did you...

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:48.530
What are you doing?

01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:53.970
Laura, everything's gonna be fine.
The police are on their way.

01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:55.770
Now you and me are gonna go upstairs

01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:58.200
- and have a nice little talk, Laura.
- No, no, no, no.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.760
The Boogeyman, he's here, okay?

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.840
- We have to go.
- No, Laura. No, he's not, Laura.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.280
You should of seen what he did
to Nicky and Darren and PauI, too.

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.760
I found them.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.600
- What is that?
- It's just a sedative, Laura, that's all.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.800
It's a sedative, all right? Now, come on.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.360
Wait. Wait, do you think that I did it?

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.190
Now, Laura, please, don't make this difficult.

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:26.310
Stop! Okay, listen to me.
Listen to me, okay?

01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:29.950
If you'd have listened to Tim Jensen,
he'd still be alive.

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:31.390
To Tim Jensen?

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:38.470
He's right behind you!
He's right behind you. Look! Look!

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:40.950
- He's not behind me!
- Yes, he is!

01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:43.950
- He doesn't exist!
- Yes, he does! Look!

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:06.460
In time you'll see that I'm right.

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:35.570
No! No! No!

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.920
- It's okay, Laura. I'm here.
- No!

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.240
No, it's not you!

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.080
Henry!

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.120
Don't hurt me, please.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:52.320
- Laura, I would never hurt you.
- You hurt the rest of them.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.480
No.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:02.270
- Not me.
- Henry!

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:04.870
Stop it!

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:08.270
Leave her alone!

01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:16.750
Try to remember, Henry.

01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:24.630
Try to remember what actually happened
the night that your parents were killed.

01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:26.500
He was waiting for me.

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:32.260
He was hiding from my family in the closet.

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.660
The Boogeyman wasn't there, Henry.

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:41.660
He wasn't there when you were 11,
and he isn't there now.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:49.740
See?

01:15:57.770 --> 01:16:01.330
- No, no, no. I can't do it. I can't do it.
- You don't have a choice.

01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:03.370
Stop! Hey!

01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:05.090
No! What're you doing?

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:07.530
- You stay right there. Right there.
- Please, help me!

01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:11.450
This is how you do it.

01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:15.770
If you want to conquer your fears,
you have to face them.

01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:17.680
Face them head-on.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.560
Face the darkness on your own.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.080
Look him right in the eye.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.280
He's not reaI, Henry.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.600
- He's only in your head.
- Oh, no. Help me. No!

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.720
He has power over you because you allow it.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.710
He's in here! Help me! Oh, God.

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:45.550
Help me!

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:48.710
Help me!

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:52.550
Help me!

01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:01.590
<i>He's hiding. I saw the Boogeyman.</i>

01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:04.430
<i>He's... He is real.</i>

01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:07.580
He's not reaI, Henry.

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.780
He's only in your head.

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:26.740
The night mom and dad died,
I should've done something.

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:29.020
What could you do? You were 11.

01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:33.330
- I can help you.
- Help me?

01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:36.290
- Yeah.
- Like you always have?

01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:42.770
I'm your older brother.
I should've been taking care of you.

01:17:43.770 --> 01:17:46.090
I was always so scared.

01:17:47.610 --> 01:17:49.290
But the Boogeyman,

01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:57.200
I looked into his eyes,

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.960
and saw that he's afraid of nothing.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.320
You killed them. Mark, PauI!

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.520
Alison.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:13.480
- He forced them to face their fear.
- Henry.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.480
You thought the Boogeyman
was your greatest fear. You're wrong.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.120
- He'll show you your true fear.
- Henry!

01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:27.550
Stop it, Henry! Stop!

01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:30.470
Stop!

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:34.710
Henry!

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:38.670
Now, you listen to me.

01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:42.390
I hurt you much more than I helped you.

01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:45.310
I'm sorry for that.

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.620
You suffered a psychotic break.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.140
But you did help me.

01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.020
I'm completely cured.

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:42.700
Dr. Allen, let go. No, no!

01:22:53.410 --> 01:22:56.440
Dr. Allen's records indicate that
your brother was released severaI days ago

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.680
in positive mentaI health.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.320
Did you find her?

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.840
You're the one currently being treated
for Boogeyman-related delusions.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.520
Is that correct?

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:12.040
- Dr. Ryan? Did you find her?
- I told you. We searched twice.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:16.320
Except for you, we didn't find any survivors.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.870
Detective, there's something in here
I think you need to see.

01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:29.710
Good morning.

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:38.390
Well,

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:41.990
I think we found the last body.

01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.020
No.

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:28.850
I think you're gonna have to come with us.

01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:34.810
- No.
- Okay, we're gonna need some help in here.

01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:36.800
Henry, he's still in here, okay?

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.800
You have to listen to me, okay?

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.440
Henry's still in here!

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:44.920
Henry's still in here!
You have to find him. He's still in here.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.680
Henry's still in here!
Listen to me! Listen to me!

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.560
Henry's still in here!

01:25:49.760 --> 01:26:00.560
