WEBVTT

00:11.316 --> 00:13.236
Dude! Get off the computer, Muscle Man!

00:13.236 --> 00:14.526
Read the sign-up sheet!

00:14.526 --> 00:16.286
We're signed up for 130!

00:16.286 --> 00:19.506
Hey, chill out, you jerks! We still have 5 minutes.

00:19.506 --> 00:21.066
Go wait in the lounge.

00:21.066 --> 00:23.006
Fine! 5 minutes!

00:24.506 --> 00:27.986
Aw, yeah! More internet videos!

00:34.636 --> 00:37.716
Old Man Horseshoes, you're pathetic!

00:40.226 --> 00:41.726
I saw that one coming.

00:41.816 --> 00:43.326
Oh, dude! Road Hog!

00:43.326 --> 00:45.456
Oh yeah! That's a good one!

00:57.916 --> 01:00.166
This is some hilarious stuff, losers!

01:00.166 --> 01:04.306
It's got a setup, a punchline, a dude gets hurt! Come on!

01:04.406 --> 01:05.876
Still not funny.

01:06.216 --> 01:07.446
Get over here!

01:09.536 --> 01:11.786
You guys are gonna thank me for this.

01:21.006 --> 01:21.656
I-

01:22.256 --> 01:23.436
Wait for it...

01:23.586 --> 01:26.476
Why, Wedgie Ninja?

01:31.636 --> 01:33.156
Oh, my back!

01:38.456 --> 01:41.176
He just farted on that guy's back!

01:41.176 --> 01:42.746
Why are you laughing, dude?

01:44.106 --> 01:45.416
That dude did get hurt!

01:45.416 --> 01:47.446
Plus the bear farted on his back!

01:47.446 --> 01:50.766
Dude! Muscle Man, Wedgie Ninja? Glocken Bear?

01:50.806 --> 01:52.896
This viral video stuff is stupid.

01:52.896 --> 01:55.446
What? Bro, if it's so stupid,

01:55.446 --> 01:57.276
why does it have so many hits?

01:57.276 --> 02:00.576
Me and Rigby could come up with a video that gets way more hits than that.

02:00.576 --> 02:01.456
Yeah!

02:01.456 --> 02:02.906
In your dreams!

02:02.906 --> 02:05.936
Me and Fives could get way more hits than you dorks.

02:05.936 --> 02:06.946
No you couldn't.

02:06.946 --> 02:08.256
Yes we could!

02:08.256 --> 02:12.496
Ten bucks says we can make a better video than yours by the end of the week.

02:12.496 --> 02:13.236
You're on.

02:27.386 --> 02:31.506
â™ª

03:11.306 --> 03:13.186
Pay up, losers!

03:13.316 --> 03:15.796
No way! The week's not even through yet!

03:15.796 --> 03:17.656
Well, I got a million views ahead of you!

03:17.656 --> 03:19.176
You might as well just give up!

03:19.176 --> 03:22.366
No! We'll have an awesome internet video by the end of the day!

03:22.416 --> 03:24.596
How much are you going to bet on that?

03:24.666 --> 03:26.096
Double or nothing!

03:26.356 --> 03:28.626
Aw man! We're gonna be rich!

03:31.056 --> 03:34.746
Okay, best internet video ever!

03:34.786 --> 03:35.846
Take one.

03:35.896 --> 03:37.116
Wait, what do I do again?

03:37.116 --> 03:40.106
Yeah, so, just start jumping, right? And get some major air.

03:40.106 --> 03:42.726
And I don't know, then like, do some awesome backflips or something.

03:42.726 --> 03:44.296
Right. Are you getting this?

03:49.236 --> 03:51.086
Hmm, still not going high enough.

03:51.086 --> 03:52.586
I know, let me try something.

03:55.716 --> 03:56.676
Rigby!

03:58.776 --> 04:00.016
Dude, are you okay?

04:00.166 --> 04:04.866
Dude... that was AWESOME!

04:04.866 --> 04:06.516
That's called a double-jump!

04:07.236 --> 04:10.916
Is this one of those new fangled movie cameras?

04:10.996 --> 04:12.956
Oh, Pops, You don't wanna touch that,

04:12.956 --> 04:14.306
we're trying to make a movie.

04:14.406 --> 04:16.836
Does your movie have sound?

04:16.836 --> 04:20.236
Back in my day we used to call those talkies.

04:20.386 --> 04:23.116
Ha'yeah, we're making a movie about jumping on the trampoline.

04:23.116 --> 04:25.676
We used to call those jumpies.

04:25.676 --> 04:27.806
Can I be in your jumpy?

04:27.836 --> 04:29.246
Dude, Mordecai,

04:29.276 --> 04:32.166
if we put more weight on the trampoline, we could get more air, right?

04:32.166 --> 04:33.656
Yea, ok, but...

04:33.946 --> 04:36.526
Oh, somebody's dropped a shilling!

04:39.416 --> 04:41.046
You wanna be in our movie, Pops?

04:41.276 --> 04:42.596
Triple jump!

04:45.516 --> 04:47.676
I guess that was pretty high.

04:47.676 --> 04:49.746
But it wasn't a million views high.

04:49.746 --> 04:51.446
What we need is more power.

04:51.446 --> 04:52.636
Yeah.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.766
Dude! I know exactly how!

04:54.766 --> 04:55.956
OK, Pops,

04:56.056 --> 04:57.346
you're going to do a double-jump

04:57.436 --> 04:59.226
with that refrigerator.

05:00.356 --> 05:03.166
I'm going to be on the interwebs!

05:04.766 --> 05:06.486
Alright, on three.

05:06.526 --> 05:08.906
One, two, three!

05:09.346 --> 05:10.106
Jump!

05:15.616 --> 05:17.246
Dude, this is gold!

05:17.246 --> 05:19.316
Wait til Muscle Man sees this!

05:21.536 --> 05:23.746
Dude, look how high he's goin'!

05:27.196 --> 05:28.196
Dude, where'd he go?

05:28.196 --> 05:30.796
Don't worry, he'll fall down any second.

05:32.436 --> 05:34.366
Dude, he's not comin' down!

05:34.366 --> 05:35.616
Oh, no. Oh no!

05:35.706 --> 05:37.026
Dude, we've gotta go get him!

05:37.026 --> 05:39.886
What? But we've still got to take care of the viral video.

05:39.886 --> 05:41.226
Dude, he could be dead.

05:41.226 --> 05:43.346
I'm going after him and you're coming with me.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.276
- Ready? - Just a sec.

05:47.776 --> 05:49.426
Might as well have a follow-up video.

05:49.426 --> 05:52.786
OK. One, two, three!

06:01.376 --> 06:03.636
This footage is gold!

06:03.636 --> 06:05.966
We'll definitely beat Muscle Man with this.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.006
Priorities, dude.

06:07.136 --> 06:08.586
First we get Pops.

06:08.876 --> 06:10.156
Wherever he is.

06:11.466 --> 06:13.716
What is this place?

06:13.716 --> 06:16.176
Kinda looks like an insane asylum.

06:22.016 --> 06:24.416
Hey, look! it's Wedgie Ninja!

06:29.576 --> 06:30.766
Help me.

06:31.636 --> 06:32.576
What?

06:32.666 --> 06:34.576
- What's your name? - Pops.

06:34.576 --> 06:35.886
It's Pops!

06:35.936 --> 06:38.826
Step over to your right, Pops.

06:38.966 --> 06:43.076
- Is this my passport photo for the interwebs? - Sort of.

06:44.056 --> 06:46.676
Ooh, I love photos.

06:46.706 --> 06:48.546
I am ready, madame.

06:48.656 --> 06:51.236
Say 'doomed for eternity.'

06:51.236 --> 06:53.356
Doomed for eternity!

06:54.126 --> 06:55.516
No!

06:58.916 --> 07:00.876
Who are you and what did you do to Pops?

07:00.876 --> 07:03.786
My job. I'm the warden of the internet.

07:03.786 --> 07:07.926
Pops made the mistake of trying to make a viral video.

07:07.936 --> 07:08.796
So?

07:08.916 --> 07:11.236
The internet should be a serious place

07:11.236 --> 07:13.346
used for writing research papers

07:13.346 --> 07:16.636
and maybe for keeping in touch with relatives once in a while.

07:16.636 --> 07:20.086
These silly viral videos are a disease.

07:20.086 --> 07:22.356
They must be contained.

07:22.356 --> 07:23.736
Dude, that's not fair.

07:23.736 --> 07:26.186
Yeah, we're just trying to make entertaining videos.

07:26.186 --> 07:29.196
Wrong! All these people need to be punished,

07:29.196 --> 07:33.726
forced to live their stupidity on repeat forever.

07:33.726 --> 07:34.836
You're insane.

07:34.836 --> 07:36.396
It's not even Pops' fault.

07:36.396 --> 07:39.256
He was just doing us a favor. Isn't that right, Pops?

07:39.256 --> 07:42.846
I don't like the interwebs, Mordecai and Rigby!

07:42.846 --> 07:45.496
Wait a minute. Mordecai and Rigby?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.866
You're supposed to be in Pops' video.

07:47.866 --> 07:52.336
Now I have to reconfigure the laser video transporter for two more criminals

07:52.336 --> 07:58.586
that will spend eternity in endless loop for their interweb crimes.

08:08.286 --> 08:09.776
Dude, get Pops.

08:11.166 --> 08:14.106
we're gonna get you out of here but we've gotta leave right now.

08:14.106 --> 08:17.056
Go into all the videos and get as many people as you can.

08:25.936 --> 08:27.316
Pops, jump!

08:31.626 --> 08:33.066
Crimes!

08:35.176 --> 08:36.226
What?

08:38.135 --> 08:41.216
You!

08:41.216 --> 08:42.556
Guys! Up here!

08:51.746 --> 08:53.596
Old man horseshoes!

08:56.046 --> 08:57.386
Come on! Come on!

09:02.366 --> 09:05.166
You'll never get out of here alive!

09:07.626 --> 09:08.396
Get in!

09:08.536 --> 09:10.886
Wait. Who's driving this?

09:11.196 --> 09:12.226
Roadhog!

09:20.876 --> 09:22.196
We're gonna die!

09:22.196 --> 09:23.366
Look!

09:31.406 --> 09:32.406
Alright, everybody.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.926
To the portal - quick!

09:36.206 --> 09:37.476
Come on, come on!

09:37.676 --> 09:38.896
Now you, Pops!

09:42.036 --> 09:43.006
Now!

09:50.326 --> 09:51.586
Wedgie Ninja!

09:51.586 --> 09:54.916
I don't know how much longer these panties are gonna hold!

09:55.236 --> 09:57.356
- But- - Go, now!

09:57.516 --> 10:00.666
Guys... link to my video.

10:00.846 --> 10:03.426
We'll never forget you, Wedgie Ninja.

10:11.716 --> 10:13.356
Where are those clowns?

10:13.356 --> 10:16.736
Probably skipped town because they know they won't win the bet.

10:29.466 --> 10:31.116
What are you guys doin'?

10:31.446 --> 10:33.926
Mmmakin' viral videos!

10:42.876 --> 10:45.406
Oh, man, that's the best part.

10:45.406 --> 10:47.906
And two million views cannot deny.

10:47.946 --> 10:50.036
You know what else is the best part?

10:50.046 --> 10:53.086
Gettin' twenty dollars from this guy!

10:57.826 --> 10:59.906
Don't you losers have somewhere to be?
