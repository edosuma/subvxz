Cousin Larry’s mail.

12:51.872 --> 12:52.973
Air mail.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.078
Very funny, dear.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.114
Uh, would you excuse us
for just a moment?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.087
Why did you...

13:07.120 --> 13:10.056
[giggling]

13:10.090 --> 13:11.558
Come on, here we go.
Here we go.

13:11.592 --> 13:14.294
Go on, go on and play.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.062
Why did you bring her here?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.831
Well, she wanted to come.

13:17.864 --> 13:20.433
Balki, people do not bring
children to the workplace.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.603
Oh, is that so, Mr. Spock?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.404
Well, for your information,
on Mypos

13:24.437 --> 13:26.540
we always bring children
to the workplace.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.209
Well, Balki, on Mypos,
the workplace is a field.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.278
And the worst damage a child
could do is to trample a gourd.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.216
Now, this is a major
metropolitan newspaper

13:36.249 --> 13:38.619
and I have to finish a story
in exactly...

13:38.652 --> 13:40.420
In exactly...

13:40.453 --> 13:43.023
Where’s my watch? Where
is my watch? My watch is gone!

13:43.056 --> 13:45.458
‐Where’s my watch?
‐I have your watch.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.093
Now, you see it...

13:49.462 --> 13:51.197
...now you don’t.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.200
[instrumental music]

14:03.276 --> 14:07.480
Cousin, cousin, I’m, I’m sorry
I, I took so long.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.383
I, I found your watch
in the sports department.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.188
And, and in the,
the advertising department

14:15.221 --> 14:19.092
and...in the,
the classified department

14:19.125 --> 14:22.328
and this doesn’t go with
the watch but isn’t it pretty?

14:27.133 --> 14:28.935
Are you going to have
a nervous breakdance?

14:30.336 --> 14:32.438
[clinking]

14:32.472 --> 14:34.374
Balki

14:34.407 --> 14:36.677
nothing can spoil this day.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.979
In less than an hour,
the Chicago Chronicle

14:39.012 --> 14:42.683
hits the streets
with my story on the front page.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.218
Cousin, that’s wonderful!

14:45.251 --> 14:48.655
Wait ’til I tell Tess.
She’ll be pleased as lunch.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.292
Where is the little darling?

14:52.325 --> 14:55.328
Don’t suppose it’s too much
to hope the police have her?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.700
Cousin, she’s with Miss Lydia,
who unlike you

14:59.733 --> 15:01.668
has the patience
to nurture a child.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.673
Wait ’til I get
my hands on you!

15:06.707 --> 15:08.942
You little devil child!

15:08.975 --> 15:11.044
‐Don’t let her get me!
‐Uh, uh, Lydia! Lydia!

15:11.077 --> 15:12.546
Wh‐what is going on?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.582
That little monster
left me a note!

15:19.485 --> 15:22.589
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
who covered my telephone

15:22.623 --> 15:24.691
in peanut butter and jelly?

15:29.763 --> 15:32.265
I just got
a melted chocolate bar

15:32.298 --> 15:34.167
in the inter‐office mail.

15:37.571 --> 15:39.339
I want an explanation,
Gorpley!

15:40.641 --> 15:42.676
We have got to get her
out of here.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.212
‐Where is she?
‐’Hey everybody!’

15:49.149 --> 15:52.252
Look how big I am.
I can reach this.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.754
That turns on the sprinklers!

15:53.787 --> 15:55.055
(all)
No!

16:07.167 --> 16:09.736
[instrumental music]

16:22.248 --> 16:24.685
It’s been quite a day,
hasn’t it?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.122
Let me run the highlight film
for you, Balki.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.593
[sighs]

16:32.626 --> 16:36.262
For the first time
in 75 years

16:36.296 --> 16:39.199
the Chicago Chronicle
didn’t publish.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.603
But what do I care?

16:42.636 --> 16:45.739
At some time,
in the next 75 years

16:45.772 --> 16:47.674
maybe I’ll get another chance

16:47.708 --> 16:50.343
to have a story
on the front page.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.280
And who do we have to thank?

16:55.448 --> 16:57.217
Tess, the Terrible

16:57.250 --> 16:59.753
and her Mypiot babysitter!

17:05.125 --> 17:06.126
[sighs]

17:07.661 --> 17:09.695
I’m sorry, cousin,
I wasn’t paying attention.

17:12.633 --> 17:14.734
I was sitting here

17:14.768 --> 17:16.737
sitting here thinking

17:16.770 --> 17:18.771
maybe I was too lenient
with Tess.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.242
No.

17:24.578 --> 17:26.780
Thanks, cousin,
but you can’t change my mind.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.516
[knock on door]

17:32.252 --> 17:33.253
[sighs]

17:35.121 --> 17:38.324
My mother said
I should give these to you.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.426
And thank you
for taking care of me.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.329
Oh, these are my favorite.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.698
Tollbooth cookies.

17:46.767 --> 17:50.637
Are you mad at me because I
made it rain on your newspaper?

17:50.671 --> 17:52.272
Oh, I’m not mad at you.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.746
Uh, I’m not mad at you

17:59.780 --> 18:02.516
but, but you‐you‐you
shouldn’t have

18:02.549 --> 18:04.317
turned on the sprinklers.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.352
That was wrong

18:06.386 --> 18:09.890
but I was also wrong because
I shouldn’t have let you do

18:09.923 --> 18:11.457
whatever you wanted to do.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.694
It got us all into
a lot of trouble.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.165
Does, does this mean
we can’t be friends anymore?

18:20.834 --> 18:22.836
We can still be friends

18:22.869 --> 18:25.706
but I’m going to have
to say a word to you

18:25.739 --> 18:29.142
that I’ve never said
to a child before.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.048
I’m‐I’m going to
have to‐to say...

18:38.919 --> 18:40.253
...no.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.223
I can live with that.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.759
Oh, Tess, Tess, I can’t
expect you to understand

18:45.792 --> 18:49.162
how anybody ever going
to say such an ugly world

18:49.195 --> 18:50.531
but sometimes in life,
you just have to be‐‐

18:50.564 --> 18:52.666
Balki. Balki!

18:52.699 --> 18:54.167
Yeah?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.335
I get it.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.605
‐You‐you do?
‐Yeah.

18:58.639 --> 18:59.906
‐Y‐you don’t mind.
‐No.

18:59.940 --> 19:01.708
Oh, well, in that case,
there’s more.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.312
I’m going to have
to ask you to do something

19:06.346 --> 19:08.414
you might not want to do.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.282
Like what?

19:09.315 --> 19:13.253
Like apologize
to Uncle Cousin Larry

19:13.286 --> 19:15.221
for everything you did today.

19:31.505 --> 19:34.775
I’m really sorry
that I got you all wet.

19:34.808 --> 19:37.377
And I’m sorry I got you
in trouble with your boss.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.614
And I’m sorry I broke
your watch.

19:44.718 --> 19:46.186
Well...

19:49.556 --> 19:50.957
...that’s okay.

19:50.991 --> 19:53.259
It was an old watch.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.362
Bu you’re gonna have to be

19:56.396 --> 19:59.833
a‐a little more careful
from now on.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.368
‐Yeah, yeah, I will.
‐Okay.

20:02.402 --> 20:05.806
‐Well, bye, Larry.
‐Bye‐bye.

20:05.839 --> 20:06.840
Bye, Balki.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.782
Well...I guess

20:15.816 --> 20:17.918
she’s not so bad after all.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.955
You know...

20:21.988 --> 20:24.424
...I’ll never forget the look
on Wainwright’s face

20:24.457 --> 20:26.226
when that water hit him.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.795
Was it me

20:28.829 --> 20:31.497
or did you see steam
rising from his head?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.503
Are you asking

20:36.537 --> 20:39.573
did‐did I see steam
rising from his head

20:39.606 --> 20:42.576
or did I see you
rising from his head?

20:46.046 --> 20:48.481
I’m asking was it me

20:48.515 --> 20:51.518
or did you see steam
rising from his head?

20:57.758 --> 21:01.327
Okay, okay, are you asking

21:01.361 --> 21:04.831
was it me who saw steam
rising from his head

21:04.865 --> 21:07.768
or was it you who saw steam
rising from his head?

21:08.769 --> 21:10.303
I’m asking was it me

21:10.336 --> 21:13.273
or did you see steam
rising from his head?

21:19.045 --> 21:21.648
Yes. Now I have one for you.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.886
Was it me

21:25.919 --> 21:27.821
or was that Miss Lydia’s
beauty mark

21:27.854 --> 21:29.355
sliding down her cheek?

21:35.028 --> 21:36.296
It was you.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.300
It was definitely you
sliding down her cheek.

21:43.537 --> 21:45.038
(Tess)
’Balki.’

21:45.071 --> 21:46.406
’Hey, Balki.’

21:50.944 --> 21:52.412
Hi, Tess.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.681
’I wanna talk
to Uncle Cousin Larry.’

21:54.715 --> 21:56.082
Oh.

21:56.116 --> 21:58.084
Uh, Cousin Larry,
come‐come and talk to Tess.

21:58.118 --> 21:59.853
I think she wants to be friends.

22:00.554 --> 22:02.556
No.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.457
Cousin Larry,
you come over to the window.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.993
She came all
the way down here...

22:07.027 --> 22:09.095
She came all the way down here
to make friends

22:09.129 --> 22:10.897
and say she was sorry,
the least you can do

22:10.931 --> 22:12.933
is stick your head out
the window and say hello.

22:12.966 --> 22:15.435
Okay, okay. Hmm.

22:15.468 --> 22:19.039
I...guess I haven’t been
very nice to her.

22:23.777 --> 22:24.878
Hi, Tess.

22:24.911 --> 22:25.946
[Tess giggling]

22:50.470 --> 22:51.572
Is it me...

22:53.039 --> 22:56.677
...or is that steam
rising out of your head?

22:56.710 --> 22:59.479
[instrumental music]

23:06.553 --> 23:08.989
[theme music]

23:36.082 --> 23:37.083
[music continues]
