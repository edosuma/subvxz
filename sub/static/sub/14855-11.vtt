00:10.772 --> 00:13.039
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper.</i>

00:13.443 --> 00:15.586
<i>And this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

00:16.811 --> 00:19.610
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

00:19.695 --> 00:21.084
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

00:22.006 --> 00:23.723
Who the hell are you people?

00:24.090 --> 00:25.741
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

00:26.482 --> 00:28.934
<i>I know all this
because I'm living the same day...</i>

00:29.641 --> 00:31.411
<i>... over and over again.</i>

00:31.460 --> 00:34.486
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

00:34.543 --> 00:36.117
<i>Someone went a long way to set me up.</i>

00:36.314 --> 00:37.552
Konrad Deitweiler,

00:38.079 --> 00:39.170
Tobias Booth...

00:39.299 --> 00:41.533
<i>But I finally discovered
who really killed Garza.</i>

00:41.730 --> 00:42.984
Miguel Dominguez...

00:43.115 --> 00:45.160
<i>A gang member
who's supposed to be in prison.</i>

00:45.226 --> 00:47.188
<i>My informant, Damien,
helped me track him down.</i>

00:47.189 --> 00:48.647
You gotta tell me about Dominguez!

00:49.224 --> 00:50.444
Whose address is this?

00:52.172 --> 00:53.342
<i>And I caught the killer.</i>

00:53.583 --> 00:55.453
<i>- I cleared my name...</i>
- You're a free man!

00:55.454 --> 00:57.645
<i>I thought this was over.
I thought I'd escaped the day...</i>

00:57.646 --> 00:59.212
You wanna watch the sun rise with me?

01:00.795 --> 01:01.769
<i>...but I didn't.</i>

01:02.363 --> 01:04.703
<i>So now, I'm wondering what comes next...</i>

01:05.165 --> 01:07.078
<i>and if anything I do even matters.</i>

01:08.214 --> 01:10.214
Day Break 1x11
What if he walks away?

01:22.762 --> 01:25.724
Hey, Andrea. What's up? Rehab? Waow...

01:26.600 --> 01:28.453
Yeah, I know.
And he's really lucky to have you.

01:28.454 --> 01:29.588
Hey, Damien. It's me.

01:29.769 --> 01:31.896
I know. I know about the safehouse.

01:31.978 --> 01:34.565
I have a lead on some people
who I think did this.

01:34.601 --> 01:36.403
And I won't be able to make
the 9 o'clock,

01:36.404 --> 01:38.075
but tell your niece
I said happy birthday.

01:38.076 --> 01:40.650
My name is Brett Hopper.
You sent me a package, you're in danger.

01:40.699 --> 01:42.711
Stay away from Baxter,
skip the morning swim

01:42.712 --> 01:43.798
and get out of town, Eva.

01:43.832 --> 01:45.134
Then, it's gonna be okay.

01:45.167 --> 01:46.915
Yes, I know about the briefcase.

01:47.195 --> 01:49.645
No, listen.
Don't even stop for coffee, Margo.

01:49.756 --> 01:52.459
Why? Because if you don't,
you're gonna get hit by a bus!

01:56.999 --> 01:58.037
Who are you talking to?

01:59.307 --> 02:00.272
Nobody.

02:00.865 --> 02:01.755
Just people.

02:03.338 --> 02:04.311
What is it?

02:05.704 --> 02:07.204
Never does it get sick of it?

02:08.370 --> 02:09.364
Sick of what?

02:10.991 --> 02:12.937
I don't know. Just...
talk to the same people,

02:13.498 --> 02:14.883
doing the same things...

02:15.279 --> 02:16.894
Doing to the same places...

02:17.801 --> 02:19.186
Sure I do.

02:19.351 --> 02:21.667
Not everybody I work with
is a ray of sunshine.

02:23.415 --> 02:24.420
That's the job.

02:25.154 --> 02:26.309
People count on us.

02:27.609 --> 02:29.207
What's the quote ?

02:29.208 --> 02:31.095
85% of life is just showing off?

02:36.894 --> 02:38.322
I don't know. Some days...

02:38.570 --> 02:40.312
Some days, I really hate this job.

02:40.630 --> 02:42.378
Man up, Preisser, nobody likes a whiner.

02:42.817 --> 02:44.822
Did you hear how that cop
talked to me back there?

02:44.823 --> 02:46.451
He was totally disrespectful.

02:46.452 --> 02:49.259
If you joined the IA to make friends,
you're a bonehead with the enemy.

02:49.660 --> 02:51.008
Cops are gonna take shots at us.

02:51.811 --> 02:52.920
If you ground it up now,

02:53.380 --> 02:54.685
that guy's still gonna be running

02:54.730 --> 02:56.594
parking tickets
when you make lieutenant.

02:58.548 --> 02:59.644
Hey, Hippo!

02:59.645 --> 03:00.825
Take that last nutty bar.

03:01.028 --> 03:02.167
I won't sue you.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.233
Hey fellas, question:

03:26.846 --> 03:28.136
when did you stopped caring?

03:29.416 --> 03:30.375
Excuse me?

03:30.569 --> 03:33.242
No, for real, you used to be cops,
you used to stand for something.

03:33.243 --> 03:34.252
Used to help people.

03:34.672 --> 03:35.642
What happened?

03:36.603 --> 03:37.568
You.

03:38.556 --> 03:39.781
Why did you just give up?

03:41.099 --> 03:42.300
We're tourists.

03:43.537 --> 03:44.622
It's a serious question.

03:45.712 --> 03:46.733
How does it feel

03:47.178 --> 03:48.189
to be dead inside?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.062
Do yourself a favor, alright?

03:50.953 --> 03:51.923
Walk away.

03:53.338 --> 03:54.719
Right now, just walk away.

04:04.429 --> 04:05.422
Yeah.

04:06.388 --> 04:07.822
That's sound a better idea.

04:08.658 --> 04:09.629
Thanks guys.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.283
Hey, baby.

04:16.476 --> 04:17.701
I thought you left.

04:18.004 --> 04:20.033
Let's blow off the work for a day.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.278
- What?
- Yeah.

04:21.279 --> 04:22.733
Call in, take a vacation day.

04:23.375 --> 04:24.515
Oh, we shouldn't.

04:24.934 --> 04:25.898
Come on.

04:26.029 --> 04:28.022
- Should we?
- Just one single day.

04:28.645 --> 04:30.053
We could be here tomorrow.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.262
Look, in ten years...

04:31.660 --> 04:32.622
what'll you remember?

04:33.102 --> 04:34.806
A day doing the same old thing?

04:35.710 --> 04:37.440
Or a day getting crazy with me.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.510
How crazy?

04:43.066 --> 04:44.032
You like?

04:44.216 --> 04:45.382
Yeah, I like!

04:47.530 --> 04:48.499
Maybe...

04:48.500 --> 04:50.629
Maybe we should stay
somewhere less expensive.

04:50.682 --> 04:53.146
My friend knows
this nice motel off the street.

04:53.147 --> 04:56.027
Baby, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta do it right.

04:56.459 --> 04:58.104
What is gotten into you today?

04:58.321 --> 05:00.234
Just felt it was time for a break.

05:01.020 --> 05:02.921
You know what I love about Vegas?

05:03.124 --> 05:04.409
Free drinks and hot chicks?

05:04.410 --> 05:05.456
It's unpredictable...

05:05.510 --> 05:07.882
You gotta deal the cards, roll the dice.

05:07.928 --> 05:09.081
Anything can happen.

05:09.908 --> 05:11.507
- Come on.
- You got a history, here,

05:11.562 --> 05:13.948
you don't want me to listen.
It's not that unpredictable.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.028
Pretty much everyone leaves
the standard loser.

05:16.447 --> 05:17.444
Not us, baby.

05:17.666 --> 05:18.649
Not today.

05:19.253 --> 05:20.419
Five hundred dollar?

05:20.420 --> 05:21.913
And that's for a regular suite?

05:21.914 --> 05:23.932
Last minute avaibility is limited.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.318
How much for your best suite?

05:26.319 --> 05:29.228
The presidential suite starts
at five thousand dollars a night.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.024
We don't have that kind of money.

05:34.081 --> 05:36.480
We're gonna be right back, Amy.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.662
I thought at the bank you said

05:39.724 --> 05:41.823
you're only seeking out
a few hundred for this trip.

05:41.915 --> 05:44.170
- How much is that?
- Just got to make one bet. That's it.

05:44.268 --> 05:46.671
Since when did you become
the big gambler?

05:47.378 --> 05:50.262
I want you to get us some drinks,
and I'll meet you at the bar.

05:50.281 --> 05:52.404
OK, but don't go crazy,
that's all the cash we have.

05:52.405 --> 05:53.373
I got you.

05:53.649 --> 05:54.606
Alright.

05:56.507 --> 05:58.394
OK, can I make a bet on the Dodger game?

05:58.546 --> 05:59.686
Sir, this is Las Vegas.

05:59.778 --> 06:02.845
What kind of odds can you get me
on a bet that's like, let's say...

06:03.081 --> 06:05.322
Dodge over the Giants, 11-10.

06:05.375 --> 06:08.586
Seven run, Dodger rally
about the bottom of the... 9th.

06:09.261 --> 06:11.659
I take it you like long shots.

06:15.054 --> 06:16.339
How much did you put down?

06:16.391 --> 06:17.637
- All of it.
- What?

06:17.980 --> 06:20.146
You gambled 6 runs
in the bottom of the 9th.

06:20.218 --> 06:21.235
It's OK.

06:21.467 --> 06:22.436
They'll come back.

06:23.315 --> 06:25.274
<i>Oh, it looks like he got it!</i>

06:25.275 --> 06:26.323
What did happen?

06:26.324 --> 06:28.892
Pretty one homerun to left
after a naughty fast ball.

06:28.893 --> 06:30.308
Keep watching, it's good.

06:39.038 --> 06:40.820
Oh my god, you win !

06:46.722 --> 06:48.138
Look at this place!

06:51.755 --> 06:53.013
Look at the view!

06:57.603 --> 07:00.251
So this is how the other 1% lives.

07:02.650 --> 07:04.669
- You hungry?
- No...

07:06.044 --> 07:07.342
You spoiled me enough.

07:08.715 --> 07:10.811
It's been the most amazing day.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.438
I still don't know how you did it.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.960
I don't know. I guess...

07:17.882 --> 07:19.728
luck finally came my way.

07:23.757 --> 07:24.904
Look...

07:25.282 --> 07:26.417
fake New York...

07:27.506 --> 07:28.551
Fake Italy...

07:29.469 --> 07:31.051
Do you think next time
when we come here

07:31.052 --> 07:32.552
we can stay at fake Paris?

07:32.936 --> 07:35.135
Why do we gotta setup for fake anything?

07:42.179 --> 07:43.520
If you could go anywhere...

07:45.340 --> 07:46.564
in the all world.

07:48.351 --> 07:49.882
Where would it be? New York...

07:50.233 --> 07:51.853
- Paris...
- Mexico.

07:54.798 --> 07:56.924
I used to go down there
when I was a kid.

07:57.159 --> 07:58.915
Those <i>pelicanos...</i>

08:00.193 --> 08:01.643
it was magical.

08:05.172 --> 08:07.261
DAY 2(del vo)

08:07.404 --> 08:08.368
- No way!
- What?

08:08.431 --> 08:11.529
Of all the places in Mexico,
I used to come here when I as a kid.

08:12.331 --> 08:13.294
For real?

08:13.897 --> 08:16.541
Right before my parents split,
we used to come down every spring,

08:16.542 --> 08:19.030
me and my brother used to swim
and play here all week.

08:20.318 --> 08:21.803
What are the chances of that happening?

08:29.003 --> 08:30.277
What's up hot mama?

08:31.255 --> 08:32.767
We should, like, just move here.

08:32.967 --> 08:34.164
It sounds good to me.

08:35.092 --> 08:36.794
I think you're kidding, city boy.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.518
You can never leave LA.
You'd miss all the excitement of home.

08:50.329 --> 08:51.821
Actually I could get used to this.

08:53.589 --> 08:55.066
As long as you're with me.

09:03.998 --> 09:04.549
+

09:16.929 --> 09:20.612
<i>- Buenos dias, señor, señorita.</i>
- Hey, what's happening?

09:20.941 --> 09:23.012
- What's this thing called again?
- <i>Abahablast.</i>

09:23.435 --> 09:24.408
What's in it?

09:24.506 --> 09:27.118
Well, a concoction of rhum,
tequila, brandy,

09:27.119 --> 09:29.567
triple-sec, orange, and pineapple,

09:29.622 --> 09:31.877
cranberry and a special
secret ingredient.

09:31.940 --> 09:32.840
You want some?

09:32.902 --> 09:35.787
No, thanks.
I like my liquor like I like my pizza.

09:36.115 --> 09:37.741
Less than three ingredients.

09:38.427 --> 09:40.856
- You've got some, and leave a little.
- Yeah.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.443
This is amazing.

09:45.444 --> 09:47.364
I could do this every day.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.935
Maybe we should...

09:50.537 --> 09:51.891
DAY 3 (del vo)

09:58.110 --> 10:00.338
<i>Buenos dias señor, señorita.</i>

10:00.718 --> 10:01.708
Thank you!

10:02.902 --> 10:05.160
- What is thing called again?
- <i>Abahablast.</i>

10:05.584 --> 10:06.515
What's in it?

10:06.738 --> 10:10.789
Well, a concoction of rhum,
tequila, brandy, triple-sec, and...

10:10.790 --> 10:12.008
What's the secret ingredient?

10:12.009 --> 10:14.183
It wouldn't be a secret if I told you.

10:19.463 --> 10:20.864
This is so amazing.

10:21.357 --> 10:22.799
I could do this every day.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.105
DAY 4 (del vo)

10:30.895 --> 10:32.296
What is this thing called again?

10:32.297 --> 10:33.646
<i>Abahablast.<i/></i>

10:33.743 --> 10:35.823
It's got rhum, tequila, brandy,

10:35.914 --> 10:38.444
Triple-sec, orange, cranberry,
pineapple,

10:38.555 --> 10:41.251
and the secret ingredient is
pomegranate juice.

10:44.924 --> 10:46.680
How could you possibly know all that?

10:46.681 --> 10:48.319
I don't know.
I just knew it.

10:52.489 --> 10:53.498
This is amazing.

10:54.253 --> 10:55.983
I could do this every day.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.784
<i>Buenos dias señor, señorita.</i>

11:00.785 --> 11:02.730
<i>Buenos dias señor...</i>

11:03.943 --> 11:05.279
This is amazing.

11:05.707 --> 11:06.899
I could do this everyday.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.188
... do this everyday.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.184
... everyday.

11:10.413 --> 11:12.877
This is amazing.
I could do this every day.

11:19.217 --> 11:21.143
You know, for someone
who suggested this trip,

11:21.144 --> 11:23.294
you don't seem very happy to be here.

11:23.722 --> 11:25.040
I am.
It's great.

11:26.071 --> 11:27.940
- I love it here.
- No, you don't.

11:28.257 --> 11:29.253
I can tell.

11:29.632 --> 11:30.595
What's going on Brett?

11:30.739 --> 11:34.089
I don't know,
I'm just not feeling this place anymore.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.881
We just got here this morning.

11:43.532 --> 11:45.022
What if I told you that...

11:45.399 --> 11:48.571
A surfer dude is gonna eat sand
in about like 5 seconds.

11:49.434 --> 11:51.564
- How could you even...
- Just watch.

11:52.066 --> 11:53.147
Look.

11:58.737 --> 12:01.737
Yeah. His name is Spence, he works
for an overnight shipping company.

12:01.738 --> 12:04.927
He got caught smoking weed on the job,
so they fired him yesterday.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.048
Are you making this up?

12:06.082 --> 12:09.200
The waitress, that's about
to bring us here Abahablast.

12:10.048 --> 12:13.207
Ask her... if she left her curling
iron on this morning.

12:13.829 --> 12:15.882
<i>Buenos dias señor, señorita.</i>

12:16.159 --> 12:17.171
Ask her.

12:18.144 --> 12:20.275
You left your curling iron on
this morning.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.906
Oh, my God!

12:23.966 --> 12:25.747
Don't worry,
her house isn't gonna burn down,

12:25.748 --> 12:27.446
she just left a mark on the sink.

12:27.682 --> 12:29.159
How could you even know that?

12:29.160 --> 12:31.827
This one, I have been working
on with practises.

12:33.242 --> 12:36.742
"Sorry, that one sank like a dive-bomber
at operation metal horn."

12:36.743 --> 12:40.017
Sorry, that one sank like a dive-bomber
at operation metal horn.

12:40.347 --> 12:42.582
- Thank guys.
- All right, take care, man.

12:42.706 --> 12:44.948
- You're scaring me.
- That's ok.

12:45.554 --> 12:48.765
I'm just living the same day
over and over and over again.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.707
- What?
- Come get a drink with me at the bar.

12:52.079 --> 12:53.692
There're some things I need to tell you.

12:53.918 --> 12:55.974
I mean, at first, I thought that I...

12:56.486 --> 12:58.412
There was something wrong with me.

12:58.969 --> 13:01.671
I got an MRI, I spoke with a doctor.

13:02.737 --> 13:03.838
He didn't find anything.

13:03.982 --> 13:06.842
You're saying that we've
done this 12 times.

13:07.076 --> 13:08.711
Same beach, same hotel.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.128
A place you came, as a kid.

13:11.350 --> 13:14.692
But here's the thing: I know how happy
this place makes you.

13:15.601 --> 13:16.584
But I just...

13:18.064 --> 13:20.070
I just... I can't take it anymore.

13:21.199 --> 13:24.291
So you pick up another spot,
and we go there tomorrow.

13:24.423 --> 13:25.668
Anywhere. No problem.

13:26.442 --> 13:30.388
So while we're living large in Mexico,
you're accused of murder in L.A.

13:30.522 --> 13:32.803
- Yeah.
- And you know who's framing you.

13:33.649 --> 13:36.965
And these people back home,
they're getting hurt, every day.

13:38.176 --> 13:39.515
Yeah, but like I said,

13:40.066 --> 13:41.035
the day...

13:41.378 --> 13:43.212
It resets itself every day.

13:44.123 --> 13:48.259
Look. I used to think
that if kept doing these things,

13:49.503 --> 13:51.192
if I could solve the case,

13:51.193 --> 13:52.999
if I could find the real killer,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.294
if I could keep
everybody from getting hurt.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.200
I used to think
that I could fix the day.

13:58.849 --> 13:59.845
But I...

14:00.252 --> 14:02.691
I did all that stuff.
Over and over again. And  I...

14:07.564 --> 14:09.976
The day kept repeating,
so it doesn't matter.

14:10.109 --> 14:11.090
I decided,

14:11.353 --> 14:13.462
if I can't do anything to change it...

14:13.794 --> 14:15.065
that I'm just gonna...

14:15.783 --> 14:19.376
I'm just gonna take care of <i>you</i>.
I'm just gonna make <i>you</i> happy.

14:21.150 --> 14:23.234
You...
But you lied to me.

14:23.879 --> 14:26.722
This trip, this day.
It's just been a... one big lie.

14:26.723 --> 14:29.817
- Wait, it's not "one big lie".
- What did you expect would happen

14:29.818 --> 14:32.257
when you told me this?
Why are you telling me this now?

14:32.258 --> 14:35.677
Because I'm tired of pretending
I'm having fun.

14:39.621 --> 14:40.630
Just pretending.

14:41.220 --> 14:42.179
Fine.

14:42.363 --> 14:43.333
That's not what I meant.

14:43.396 --> 14:46.189
I've known it for a while.
I just don't have the word.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.061
What did you say?

14:48.212 --> 14:49.947
Everything about this is wrong!

14:50.634 --> 14:52.469
What about those people
in LA who need you?

14:52.470 --> 14:53.412
They...

14:54.348 --> 14:57.167
It doesn't matter.
They don't matter, it keeps...

14:57.168 --> 14:58.398
It matters to me!

14:59.045 --> 15:01.569
Well, it's not gonna matter
tomorrow morning.

15:02.394 --> 15:05.911
Because, you're gonna...
forget we even had this conversation.

15:09.883 --> 15:10.866
You wanna bet?

16:07.183 --> 16:08.730
Hey baby, I got an idea!

16:10.527 --> 16:11.500
Why don't we...

16:12.381 --> 16:13.456
take the day off?

16:15.217 --> 16:18.125
You're suprised? Sounds like stuff
I wouldn't normally do.

16:19.777 --> 16:21.023
Why don't we...

16:22.045 --> 16:23.752
go to the desert,
over...

16:23.870 --> 16:24.957
San Francisco?

16:25.613 --> 16:26.818
What you think?

16:46.184 --> 16:47.987
Same floor, let's go!

16:48.228 --> 16:48.941
+

16:59.632 --> 17:00.591
Move, move.

17:01.051 --> 17:02.010
Go!

17:04.272 --> 17:06.680
Sir, if you're here,
please identify yourself.

17:09.989 --> 17:11.140
Move, move!

17:15.790 --> 17:16.779
Clear!

17:16.864 --> 17:18.381
Clear after search, detective.

17:18.502 --> 17:21.361
Guess at least you're free to check
the rest of the building, doesn't it?

17:33.345 --> 17:34.308
You know what I think?

17:34.476 --> 17:36.338
Police must come out here all the time.

17:36.339 --> 17:37.918
Nobody comes out of
the houses to watch.

17:37.919 --> 17:41.024
Cops is second nature in our days.
Too much reality on TV.

17:43.383 --> 17:44.582
Go. Drive.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.241
Wow, partner.

17:46.242 --> 17:47.745
I think you jumped into the wrong car.

17:47.746 --> 17:50.479
Shut up, I know who you both are.
Fencik, Buchalter.

17:50.793 --> 17:53.002
You've been following me for weeks,
videotaping.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.773
I wish I knew what you're talking about.

17:54.836 --> 17:57.490
Look, we could drive or we could all go
talk to the cops, right now.

17:57.491 --> 17:59.529
- Maybe that's a good idea.
- We can both tell 'em

17:59.530 --> 18:00.748
you're ex-sheriff deputies.

18:00.971 --> 18:03.264
That you two are involved
in the Garza murder.

18:03.265 --> 18:04.985
They'd love to
find out who killed the guy

18:05.002 --> 18:06.387
in the tub above my appartment.

18:06.429 --> 18:08.729
Do yourself a favor: get out of the car,

18:08.730 --> 18:10.996
- and walk away.
- Or we can call Detweiler.

18:11.088 --> 18:12.060
Or maybe Booth?

18:12.432 --> 18:15.120
Tell 'em what a big mess you've
been making of this whole thing.

18:15.776 --> 18:16.745
What do you say?

18:17.104 --> 18:18.087
How about you?

18:18.948 --> 18:20.382
- Let's go.
- Attaboy!

18:30.684 --> 18:32.437
I said put Shelten on the line.

18:32.438 --> 18:33.723
He's not here right now.

18:33.724 --> 18:37.021
And when he's done torturing some
beat cop, have him give me a call.

18:37.081 --> 18:39.191
Well, perhaps it'd be best
if you left a message.

18:39.237 --> 18:40.954
Tell him thanks for nothing.

18:40.955 --> 18:42.743
sending us on a wild goose chase.

18:43.553 --> 18:45.235
Alright, now you're gonna tell me...

18:45.424 --> 18:47.346
You're gonna tell me where Rita is.

18:47.508 --> 18:48.882
- Who?
- My girlfriend Rita,

18:48.883 --> 18:50.356
the girl you've been following.

18:50.488 --> 18:51.590
Videotaping.

18:51.609 --> 18:52.568
Her!

18:53.825 --> 18:55.166
You got a good taste.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.917
A girl nice to wake up next to.

18:57.085 --> 18:58.284
Shut up!

19:00.348 --> 19:02.134
It's gonna be OK.
We get down on the station,

19:02.135 --> 19:05.063
all this guy is gonna do is asking
a couple of questions about Hopper.

19:09.965 --> 19:11.768
Billy, calm down. What's wrong?

19:13.089 --> 19:14.780
Look, I can't, not today.

19:14.781 --> 19:16.041
- Who is it?
- It's Billy.

19:16.361 --> 19:17.816
What kind of trouble is he in now?

19:17.927 --> 19:20.758
Billy, just slow down,
you're not making any sense.

19:22.004 --> 19:22.975
What?

19:23.800 --> 19:24.770
What happened?

19:27.116 --> 19:28.401
Someone found the body.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.167
It must be tough keeping tabs
on a girl like that.

19:31.508 --> 19:33.061
Don't open your mouth again.

19:34.056 --> 19:36.458
- I'm just saying...
- What are you just saying?

19:36.884 --> 19:38.896
Your girlfriend has a secret,
that's all.

19:39.119 --> 19:41.045
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.104
Like you said, we've been following her.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.178
Taping her.

19:46.388 --> 19:48.426
Maybe we know things that you don't.

19:51.225 --> 19:52.653
Give me that video camera.

19:56.027 --> 19:57.140
Give me the bag too.

19:59.801 --> 20:01.178
Don't try to think cute.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.673
Damn!
How long have you been following me?

20:25.696 --> 20:26.666
Wait!

20:27.151 --> 20:28.212
What are you doing?

20:30.638 --> 20:31.607
Stop the car!

20:31.725 --> 20:32.696
Stop!

20:34.716 --> 20:35.506
+

20:41.511 --> 20:43.267
You should've walked
when you had the chance.

20:43.301 --> 20:44.467
Maybe we should call this in.

20:44.468 --> 20:46.303
I'm making an executive decision.

20:58.614 --> 21:00.174
Why did you get in the car?

21:00.738 --> 21:01.708
Idiot.

21:29.577 --> 21:30.992
How are you feeling, kid?

21:33.666 --> 21:35.357
What did you dragged my father into?

21:35.502 --> 21:36.511
Your dad and I...

21:37.049 --> 21:39.188
... were told to make the case go away.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.137
Uncle Nick?

21:46.729 --> 21:48.538
What the hell are you doing here?

21:48.813 --> 21:51.297
I've still got eyes and ears
at the station.

21:51.854 --> 21:53.729
I know all about your little situation.

21:55.879 --> 21:56.928
Who's this shooter?

21:57.238 --> 21:59.151
He's not a shooter, he's a friend.

21:59.906 --> 22:03.530
I can count the number of guys
on the force I trust on one hand.

22:04.414 --> 22:05.581
Hippo's three of 'em.

22:06.564 --> 22:09.160
He heard they were setting you up
on this Garza thing so...

22:09.294 --> 22:10.742
I told him to stay close.

22:13.409 --> 22:15.958
Your old man was on the right track
with the girl.

22:17.315 --> 22:18.285
He's with you.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.769
You're not just keeping an eye on me.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.003
You want me
to look in the Contreras murder.

22:23.063 --> 22:24.726
The Jane Doe from 15 years ago.

22:24.798 --> 22:26.581
- Where did you hear about th...
- I know...

22:26.729 --> 22:27.699
already, Nick.

22:28.584 --> 22:31.637
I know that Booth made the call
to kill Isabella Contreras.

22:31.775 --> 22:35.845
I know Dominguez pulled the trigger
and I know that you and my father...

22:36.643 --> 22:40.096
I know that you and my father
took money to make this case go away.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.800
When did you find all this out?

22:43.315 --> 22:44.284
Today.

22:46.870 --> 22:48.164
Don't judge him, Brett.

22:48.882 --> 22:51.556
Everything your old man did was
to protect you,

22:51.817 --> 22:53.050
your mum, your sister.

22:53.169 --> 22:54.440
It was never about the money.

22:54.534 --> 22:56.166
Well, then what was it about?

22:56.998 --> 22:58.604
What your stake in all this?

23:01.405 --> 23:02.728
We might wanna sit down.

23:02.991 --> 23:04.052
I don't want to sit down.

23:04.105 --> 23:07.368
I want to get this interview over.
Where the hell is Chad?

23:08.862 --> 23:10.749
- I don't know, he's not here.
- So, where is he?

23:10.783 --> 23:12.027
None of your business.

23:13.050 --> 23:14.930
I'll be conducting the interview.

23:15.199 --> 23:16.353
Consider me Shelten.

23:16.602 --> 23:17.573
Now for the day.

23:17.676 --> 23:20.521
Not till you gain a hundred pounds
and grow a pair.

23:23.099 --> 23:24.363
I know about Danny Yan.

23:25.786 --> 23:27.700
Strip club. Bank withdrawals.

23:29.161 --> 23:30.714
Call me when Shelten's back.

23:40.497 --> 23:42.437
I will be out the rest of the day.

23:51.307 --> 23:53.064
For the night or by the hour?

23:53.848 --> 23:55.441
- Excuse me?
- We're looking for a guy.

23:55.470 --> 23:56.702
Name of Billie Foster.

23:56.938 --> 23:58.367
Sorry, can't help ya.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.310
What room?

24:02.319 --> 24:05.837
The only way I've managed to stay alive
in this thing is to stay out of it.

24:05.838 --> 24:08.092
But you didn't stay out of it,
you saved my ass today.

24:08.093 --> 24:10.609
I helped you out
because I owed your old man.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.692
There's more to it than that.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.880
What's your bee with Tobias Booth?

24:15.972 --> 24:16.969
Me and him...

24:17.205 --> 24:19.039
We don't exactly see eye to eye.

24:19.131 --> 24:20.390
You wanna take him down.

24:20.482 --> 24:22.316
You really think
I'd do some that stupid?

24:22.643 --> 24:24.807
No, that's just my job, isn't it, Nick?

24:24.859 --> 24:27.093
Right?
You want me to get to Booth?

24:27.408 --> 24:28.837
I didn't pick you, son.

24:28.981 --> 24:30.213
- They did.
- Why?

24:30.722 --> 24:32.008
Booth's vindictive.

24:32.283 --> 24:33.278
Paranoid.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.280
If he set you up for this,
he thinks you can bring him down.

24:36.442 --> 24:37.648
So the question is :

24:38.015 --> 24:39.483
What can you prove?

24:40.531 --> 24:42.642
I can prove that Dominguez
isn't in prison,

24:42.786 --> 24:44.438
that he hit Garza last night.

24:44.988 --> 24:45.959
What do you got?

24:46.128 --> 24:48.279
Dominguez's print on the gun
that killed Garza.

24:48.397 --> 24:50.009
They tried to plant it in my place

24:50.101 --> 24:52.578
but there's evidence of a stakeout
in the apartment above mine.

24:52.656 --> 24:54.189
Holes drilled in the floor.

24:54.242 --> 24:55.527
Surveillance wires.

24:56.117 --> 24:57.401
A dead body in the tub.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.244
Can you tie any of it back to Booth?

24:59.277 --> 25:01.666
There were chain of corruption
that would make your head spin.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.675
Crooked cops, federal prosecutors,
prison officials.

25:04.964 --> 25:08.280
I've waited in 15 years
for this to blow up in Booth's face.

25:08.431 --> 25:10.804
Well, you should've come clean
a long time ago.

25:10.856 --> 25:12.185
None of this would be happening.

25:12.277 --> 25:13.653
I took the money, Brett.

25:14.662 --> 25:16.681
This son of a bitch had me.

25:17.139 --> 25:19.984
And I wasn't going
to piss away my life the way...

25:20.534 --> 25:21.544
What? Say it!

25:22.402 --> 25:23.372
Like my father?

25:27.173 --> 25:28.143
Listen.

25:29.887 --> 25:30.896
Here's what we do.

25:31.945 --> 25:33.111
We get on my boat,

25:34.311 --> 25:36.703
go fishing in Baha
for a couple of months.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.677
- While the heat died down.
- Can't do it, I can't leave, not today.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.932
I gotta find my girl before they do.

25:42.115 --> 25:43.112
This girlfriend.

25:43.898 --> 25:44.868
You trust her?

25:44.869 --> 25:45.864
Rita? Yeah!

25:46.179 --> 25:47.149
Of course.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.367
You watch yourself, Brett.

25:59.343 --> 26:01.492
I had Hippo get your truck for you.

26:19.365 --> 26:20.362
Any word?

26:21.017 --> 26:24.635
I checked the station. Put a bulletin
on her place like you asked.

26:24.832 --> 26:27.316
The lady at the hospital said
Rita took a vacation day.

26:27.499 --> 26:28.509
Vacation day?

26:28.915 --> 26:30.867
What d'you mean she's not here?
She started at 8.

26:30.868 --> 26:32.676
She called in,
said she was taking a day off.

26:32.833 --> 26:34.695
Anything can happen to anyone.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.138
- Is it possible?
- No, something's wrong.

26:37.139 --> 26:38.738
What about Chad, did you speak to him?

26:38.777 --> 26:41.097
That's the funny thing,
he's MIA since this morning.

26:41.205 --> 26:42.988
Hasn't checked in
with his minions all day.

26:43.538 --> 26:45.504
This is odd jumble, something's...

26:45.923 --> 26:47.840
- Something's different here.
- What do you mean?

26:47.841 --> 26:50.053
That's enough... Did you...

26:55.924 --> 26:58.270
- Did you sell me out?
- Put your hands where we can see 'em!

26:58.271 --> 26:59.384
Did you sell me out?

27:02.761 --> 27:04.111
- Backward !
- OK, OK!

27:05.580 --> 27:07.322
- Turn around, turn around!
- By the right.

27:08.332 --> 27:09.708
Did you follow me here?

27:13.081 --> 27:15.656
Brett Hopper, you're under arrest
for the murder of Alberto Garza.

27:15.657 --> 27:17.675
I didn't do it, and I can prove it.

27:17.858 --> 27:20.828
You're also under arrest
for the murder of Chad and Rita Shelten.

27:21.705 --> 27:22.676
What?

27:22.701 --> 27:23.672
What did you say?

27:23.802 --> 27:25.061
Come on, you heard me.

27:37.510 --> 27:38.506
Sit down.

27:40.335 --> 27:41.764
Sit down or I'm gonna sit you down.

27:41.896 --> 27:42.853
Try.

27:43.219 --> 27:44.373
Try and sit me down!

27:45.107 --> 27:46.103
Come on, look.

27:46.392 --> 27:47.532
We're all cops here.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.301
Now we wanna hear
your side of the story.

27:49.302 --> 27:51.162
There is no story,
because I didn't do anything.

27:51.198 --> 27:53.224
I'm sure you've got an alibi
to back that up, right?

27:53.263 --> 27:55.190
Yeah, he's halfway to Baha, by now.

27:55.191 --> 27:56.186
How convenient.

27:57.668 --> 27:59.490
Wanna know what I think happened?

27:59.739 --> 28:00.749
Thrill me.

28:01.194 --> 28:02.830
I think you killed Garza
then you ran home

28:02.902 --> 28:04.598
to your girlfriend
for a little wine down

28:04.688 --> 28:06.018
when she booted your ass out.

28:06.201 --> 28:09.399
And she called her old boy toy Shelten,

28:09.478 --> 28:11.261
so you followed her to the motel.

28:12.230 --> 28:13.227
Motel?

28:13.646 --> 28:14.799
What's the name of the motel?

28:14.800 --> 28:16.660
You busted in
on your gal pal and Shelten

28:16.661 --> 28:18.626
just as they were playing
seven minutes in heaven.

28:18.688 --> 28:20.093
Coming off the rage with Garza,

28:20.346 --> 28:23.164
- You gave 'em both what they deserved.
- What was the name of the motel?

28:23.269 --> 28:24.330
You should know it.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.860
You left you .9mm at the crime scene.

28:27.004 --> 28:28.001
I told you.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.430
I didn't execute anybody.

28:29.901 --> 28:32.391
That's probably
a guy named Miguel Dominguez.

28:36.323 --> 28:37.365
You know Dominguez?

28:37.588 --> 28:40.065
No, but it's funny
you should say "execute".

28:40.937 --> 28:42.818
OK, Garza, you did him cold.

28:43.271 --> 28:44.240
But these two?

28:45.157 --> 28:46.127
Not so neat.

28:46.562 --> 28:48.234
You shot Shelten, five times.

28:49.970 --> 28:51.645
You shot your girldfriend another three.

28:54.980 --> 28:55.950
I don't want to see that.

28:55.951 --> 28:58.276
That's what I call a crime with passion.

28:58.401 --> 28:59.463
I don't want to see those.

28:59.464 --> 29:00.782
- Real shame.
- Stop it.

29:02.532 --> 29:03.502
She's quite a looker.

29:06.098 --> 29:07.067
I need backup!

29:19.188 --> 29:20.959
Attacking an RHD detective.

29:22.321 --> 29:24.810
Not exactly the best way
to prove your innocence.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.744
I already proved 'em my innocence.

29:26.829 --> 29:28.009
When did you do that?

29:28.978 --> 29:30.001
It doesn't matter.

29:30.971 --> 29:32.033
None of it matters.

29:32.269 --> 29:33.422
How can you say that?

29:34.011 --> 29:36.489
I didn't think this day
could get any worse.

29:38.093 --> 29:39.064
But it did.

29:40.304 --> 29:41.929
And I tried to changed it...

29:43.849 --> 29:45.606
but Rita still died.

29:47.435 --> 29:49.139
And now I'm scared...

29:52.211 --> 29:54.033
... that tomorrow is gonna come.

29:55.338 --> 29:56.936
And she still gonna be dead.

30:02.771 --> 30:03.990
You cannot do that.

30:06.868 --> 30:07.851
Nobody can.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.971
See, you just have to do what's right.

30:14.170 --> 30:15.887
Punish the people who did this.

30:18.181 --> 30:19.393
You don't understand.

30:20.806 --> 30:22.320
I understand just fine.

30:22.766 --> 30:23.749
You're giving up.

30:24.483 --> 30:25.925
Stop saying that.

30:27.616 --> 30:28.872
I am trapped...

30:29.724 --> 30:30.695
in...

30:31.979 --> 30:32.949
... this thing.

30:33.067 --> 30:35.210
Hopper, what the hell happened to you?

30:36.095 --> 30:37.445
You have no idea.

30:37.615 --> 30:39.057
Then give me an idea!

30:40.081 --> 30:41.739
You don't have all the answers!

30:41.740 --> 30:42.882
Or you wouldn't be there,

30:42.883 --> 30:44.747
- feeling sorry for yourself!
- Andrea, please.

30:44.748 --> 30:46.780
So pull yourself together
and give me something.

30:46.781 --> 30:47.920
OK? Anything.

30:52.381 --> 30:53.378
Look at me.

30:58.896 --> 31:00.128
You're not alone here.

31:03.816 --> 31:05.290
But I need you to help me.

31:07.525 --> 31:10.533
If you think of anything
that can get you out of here.

31:14.530 --> 31:16.824
I know where there
is an other dead body.

31:20.029 --> 31:21.050
In a bathtub.

31:23.773 --> 31:25.149
Let me see what I can do.

31:34.290 --> 31:35.443
It's right in here.

31:47.852 --> 31:49.320
But you said there was a body here.

31:49.409 --> 31:50.373
It was.

31:52.009 --> 31:52.979
There was.

31:55.273 --> 31:56.243
Choi.

31:59.612 --> 32:01.932
All right, come in, come on.
Come, hurry.

32:11.937 --> 32:13.130
What's going on, Hop'?

32:13.877 --> 32:15.227
They cleaned it all up.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.311
Cleaned what up?

32:20.011 --> 32:21.322
It was Pelican Bay.

32:21.944 --> 32:23.911
It seems Miguel Dominguez
is resting comfortably

32:23.912 --> 32:26.270
in his cell where he's been
for the last 15 years.

32:26.271 --> 32:27.213
Let me speek to him.

32:27.214 --> 32:29.523
The man who knew the warden.
A guy named Mangle.

32:30.522 --> 32:31.843
Detweiler did not send you.

32:31.844 --> 32:33.561
I spent 12 years under that man
since the...

32:33.562 --> 32:35.371
You can't speak to him, he's in on it.

32:35.372 --> 32:37.589
So now, the warden's part
of the conspiracy too?

32:57.505 --> 32:58.470
Uncle Nick?

33:00.832 --> 33:01.157
+

33:02.158 --> 33:03.123
You did this!

33:03.238 --> 33:05.304
You told them
everything I had on Dominguez.

33:05.450 --> 33:06.530
You cleaned up that mess!

33:06.531 --> 33:08.449
I didn't clean up anybody's mess!

33:08.659 --> 33:10.064
Now calm down and hear me out.

33:10.065 --> 33:11.029
They killed Rita!

33:11.030 --> 33:12.615
I didn't have anything to do with that.

33:12.793 --> 33:14.998
Do you forget who saved your ass today?

33:15.100 --> 33:16.254
Hey, what's going on in there?

33:16.255 --> 33:17.219
It's OK.

33:17.345 --> 33:18.715
We're all right in here.

33:23.678 --> 33:25.012
So what is this uncle Nick?

33:25.117 --> 33:27.319
You're here to save me or sell me out?

33:28.531 --> 33:30.022
You don't understand, kid.

33:30.404 --> 33:31.659
I don't call the shots.

33:31.747 --> 33:33.310
I'm just middle management.

33:33.548 --> 33:34.944
A conduit for information.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.538
Yeah, you mean you're Booth's bitch.

33:36.619 --> 33:38.268
Booth is a monster and if I could,

33:38.289 --> 33:40.581
- I'd put a bullet in his head.
- Don't give me that.

33:40.596 --> 33:42.343
Every single thing I told you
about Dominguez

33:42.352 --> 33:44.102
you ran and told Booth, didn't you?

33:44.212 --> 33:45.208
Didn't you?

33:49.140 --> 33:50.123
I'm sorry.

33:51.796 --> 33:52.760
I...

33:54.149 --> 33:56.093
When he-- I didn't have the choice.

33:57.642 --> 33:59.317
When it came down to you or them,

34:00.841 --> 34:01.949
well, I picked me.

34:02.687 --> 34:05.009
See, Booth may have his grand agenda

34:05.010 --> 34:06.604
but I got one on my own too.

34:06.694 --> 34:09.205
- Survival.
- You were my father's partner.

34:10.556 --> 34:11.835
Spent Chritmas with us.

34:13.277 --> 34:14.851
Bought Jen her first bike.

34:15.429 --> 34:16.744
You sat at our table.

34:17.286 --> 34:18.536
How could you do this?

34:19.027 --> 34:22.184
Do you have any idea
how powerful these people are?

34:22.833 --> 34:23.951
If they wanted to,

34:24.103 --> 34:25.918
they could drag you
right out of this cell

34:25.918 --> 34:28.339
- and make you disappear.
- But they won't.

34:28.828 --> 34:29.994
They need a fall guy.

34:30.820 --> 34:31.962
That's why I'm here.

34:33.610 --> 34:34.828
To make you an offer.

34:38.871 --> 34:39.880
You do your time,

34:40.016 --> 34:42.042
peacefully, mouth shut.

34:43.139 --> 34:45.239
And I can garantee your safety.

34:45.916 --> 34:47.693
Nobody in here would touch you.

34:48.139 --> 34:49.716
You'd be out in seven years.

34:50.850 --> 34:52.371
I'm begging you, kid.

34:54.264 --> 34:56.309
- Give it up.
- I gave up already.

34:59.961 --> 35:01.511
But the day just got worse.

35:02.515 --> 35:03.759
And I'm paying for it.

35:04.443 --> 35:05.703
You think this is bad?

35:06.189 --> 35:07.585
Think of the alternative,

35:07.891 --> 35:09.053
the people you love.

35:09.602 --> 35:10.890
Booth can get to them.

35:12.430 --> 35:13.420
Look at you.

35:14.451 --> 35:16.787
Coming up in here like you're family,
like you care,

35:16.911 --> 35:19.190
You're no better than Detweiler
or Booth.

35:21.260 --> 35:23.964
So take your little offer
and shove it up your ass.

35:26.455 --> 35:27.977
It's easy to say now.

35:32.856 --> 35:33.892
But eventually,

35:34.504 --> 35:35.504
they'll own you.

35:36.359 --> 35:37.593
Just like they do me.

35:38.693 --> 35:39.680
And your dad.

35:40.998 --> 35:41.985
Your girlfriend.

35:44.935 --> 35:45.908
What did you say?

35:47.772 --> 35:49.135
What are you talking about?

35:49.296 --> 35:50.980
Everybody's got secrets, kid.

35:53.483 --> 35:54.456
My assets,

35:54.708 --> 35:56.347
Kinda irrelevant now, isn't it?

36:02.228 --> 36:03.744
What are you talking about?

36:04.920 --> 36:06.513
What do you know about Rita?

36:48.160 --> 36:50.033
Some days, I really hate my job.

36:50.168 --> 36:52.236
Man up, Preisser,
nobody likes a whiner.

36:52.279 --> 36:54.138
Did you hear how the cop
talk to me back there?

36:54.139 --> 36:55.737
It was totally disrespectful.

36:57.410 --> 36:58.499
Chad, it's me.

36:58.675 --> 36:59.918
Rita, everything OK?

37:00.116 --> 37:01.106
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:02.043 --> 37:03.530
No, no, it's not.

37:03.864 --> 37:04.866
<i>What's wrong?</i>

37:06.079 --> 37:07.628
- Talk to me.
- It's Brett.

37:09.276 --> 37:11.210
- This morning he...
- Did he do something to you?

37:11.223 --> 37:13.203
<i>No, no, it's nothing like that.</i>

37:14.114 --> 37:15.591
I wish I knew how to explain it...

37:15.688 --> 37:17.026
Don't forget Hopper's a cop.

37:17.135 --> 37:19.017
He may be expecting us,
don't take any chances.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.040
Did you say Hopper?

37:20.080 --> 37:22.151
We're going to his appartment,
I just got the warrant.

37:22.191 --> 37:24.914
- For what?
- Murder of a D.A, Alberto Garza.

37:25.031 --> 37:27.681
Hold on a second.
Rita, is Hopper there? Is he with you?

37:27.852 --> 37:28.905
Yeah, he's in the shower.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.260
Listen to me, I want you
to get out of there, right now.

37:31.274 --> 37:33.104
- What's going on?
- He's wanted for the murder

37:33.150 --> 37:35.115
of a guy named Alberto Garza,
get out of there.

37:37.782 --> 37:38.718
Change your plans.

37:38.719 --> 37:40.222
Hopper's not at his place.

37:46.032 --> 37:47.014
You called Chad?

37:48.905 --> 37:50.093
Does he know I'm here?

37:53.434 --> 37:54.707
He must have called SWAT.

37:54.805 --> 37:55.772
Why him?

37:56.876 --> 37:58.139
Why did you call Chad?

37:58.370 --> 38:01.302
- I don't know.
- Think, there must be some reason.

38:01.498 --> 38:02.474
I don't...

38:03.082 --> 38:04.380
I woke up this morning.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.279
- I just had this feeling.
- What kind of a feeling?

38:08.388 --> 38:09.595
Something different.

38:10.103 --> 38:11.262
Like something was wrong.

38:11.315 --> 38:13.206
You're keeping something from me?

38:14.439 --> 38:15.403
A secret?

38:15.718 --> 38:16.681
A secret?

38:17.129 --> 38:19.148
Like the one you're keeping from me,
Brett?

38:19.239 --> 38:21.180
Chad said you're accused of murder.

38:23.181 --> 38:24.552
That all thing is a set-up.

38:24.615 --> 38:27.694
You have to believe me when
I say I did not kill Garza.

38:29.683 --> 38:31.357
How did you know it was Garza?

38:35.236 --> 38:38.477
- You were here with me all last night,
you know I couldn't have done this.

38:38.555 --> 38:40.704
Everything about this is... wrong.

38:41.345 --> 38:42.639
And maybe I've known for a while,

38:42.640 --> 38:44.644
and I just... didn't have the word.

38:45.009 --> 38:46.927
No, I wanna protect you,
I wanna keep you safe!

38:46.928 --> 38:48.603
I don't feel safe, right now.

38:48.887 --> 38:49.935
Rita, please.

38:53.563 --> 38:56.156
I'm not the one
that's different this morning.

38:56.344 --> 38:57.317
It's you.

39:00.324 --> 39:03.589
You're not the same guy
I went to sleep with last night.

39:04.976 --> 39:05.957
You should go.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.256
No, I'm not leaving.

39:08.371 --> 39:11.778
Then you can explain everything
to the cops when they get here.

39:33.291 --> 39:34.485
Glad you could make it.

39:36.567 --> 39:38.523
You and me both.

39:39.892 --> 39:43.426
Those skinheads were to smoke my ass
back at the safehouse.

39:43.894 --> 39:45.255
Thanks for the heads up.

39:45.649 --> 39:46.649
Least I can do.

39:49.871 --> 39:52.755
I still can't believe Hopper
and Baxter set me up.

39:52.985 --> 39:54.471
They gonna answer for that.

39:54.472 --> 39:55.979
We got bigger problems.

39:56.630 --> 39:58.349
Garza got wacked last night.

39:59.670 --> 40:01.035
So, what does that mean?

40:01.789 --> 40:03.280
They're making their move.

40:03.679 --> 40:06.297
And neither one of us is
gonna like where that's going.

40:06.402 --> 40:08.397
This whole town's going up in flames.

40:08.512 --> 40:10.309
So, I say we take 'em out now.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.176
Torrez, Booth,
all the lot of them.

40:12.389 --> 40:13.398
First, we talk.

40:14.017 --> 40:15.029
We gotta be smart.

40:15.279 --> 40:17.126
So what, you gonna have
a sit-down with Booth ?

40:17.127 --> 40:18.110
Not with Booth.

40:18.793 --> 40:19.933
I'm going above him.

40:20.769 --> 40:22.534
Straight to the man at the top.
