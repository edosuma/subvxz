<i>Wow!

00:47.339 --> 00:51.559
- We got to get us one of those.
- I don't think he's on our side.

00:52.979 --> 00:54.309
Great work Kato.

00:54.349 --> 00:56.599
Come on out Scaramantula.

00:56.599 --> 01:00.599
- You're finished.
- Well if it isn't the Blue Morpho.

01:00.649 --> 01:02.819
If you think you can
just waltz in here

01:02.859 --> 01:06.269
and muscle in on my racket
you've got another thing coming!

01:06.329 --> 01:07.409
Ooh-ah.

01:07.439 --> 01:11.109
It's "another think coming."
God!

01:12.279 --> 01:17.089
No need to be alarmed Dr. Venture.
I'll have you free in a jiff.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.369
- You're in the hands of the Blue ...
- Blue Morpho.

01:19.419 --> 01:22.959
Yes I've heard of you.
Nothing good I'm afraid.

01:23.009 --> 01:26.129
Ow! Wait a minute.
I'm not ... ow!

01:26.179 --> 01:29.349
<i>But after that they become
like friends and stuff.</i>

01:29.379 --> 01:31.019
He shows up again in issue 36

01:31.049 --> 01:34.599
- when they team up to fight L. Ron Hubbard.
- Yeah super.

01:34.639 --> 01:37.359
None of this explains what
he was doing in my basement.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.969
Dude this was your parents' basement.

01:39.979 --> 01:44.029
Don't you get it?
Your dad was the Blue Morpho.

01:44.059 --> 01:47.119
Please.
My father was a boozed-up socialite

01:47.149 --> 01:49.979
who collected butterflies
in his copious spare time.

01:49.989 --> 01:52.899
- No way he could've been a su...
- Superhero?

01:52.959 --> 01:55.119

01:55.159 --> 01:58.989
Dude millionaire playboy's like

01:59.049 --> 02:01.879
Come on butterflies?
Think about it ... Blue Morpho.

02:01.919 --> 02:05.999
- What the [bleep] is a Morpho?!
- It's a kind of butterfly dingus.

02:06.049 --> 02:10.469
Uh ... I'm sorry.
It's just a lot to process okay?

02:10.508 --> 02:15.179
I mean my god ... "crime computer"?
So corny.

02:15.179 --> 02:18.649
- Well at least he had a cool car.
- No duh.

02:18.679 --> 02:22.019
Say did Blue Morpho ever
has his own comic book?

02:22.069 --> 02:26.019
Uh... canceled after six issues.
Not Kirby's best work.

02:29.479 --> 02:32.359
<i>Aw come on Brock. Why not? </i>

02:32.409 --> 02:33.999
Because it's like cheating Hank.

02:34.029 --> 02:38.079
But so is flying in an airplane
or having a fake leg

02:38.119 --> 02:40.449
- when you think about it. Which I do.
- For the last time ... no!

02:40.499 --> 02:43.039
You cannot have anabolic steroids.

You want to get fit?
This is how you do it.

02:45.539 --> 02:48.539
Make it stop.

03:55.609 --> 03:58.449
<i>Oh my god!

04:05.089 --> 04:08.959
Car of the future kind of deal.
Zero emissions titanium uni-body.

04:09.009 --> 04:11.259
Electromagnets are what keep her afloat.

04:11.289 --> 04:13.629
See? This is the kind of
thing I'm talking about.

04:13.629 --> 04:16.499
Let's toss this baby into
production and call it a day.

04:16.529 --> 04:19.428
Eh well don't punch the
clock just yet there Doc.

04:19.469 --> 04:23.139

07:15.559 --> 07:18.529
Why are we digging through
J.J.'s Project Morgue anyways?

07:18.559 --> 07:21.529
- What are you looking for?
- Inspiration? A head start?

07:21.569 --> 07:23.649
I don't know. I've been
out of the game for a while.

07:23.699 --> 07:26.449
I'm a little rusty.
Not as in Rusty Venture I mean.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.159
Yes I know what you meant.

07:28.209 --> 07:30.319
But we didn't come here to
be a couple of patent clerks.

07:30.379 --> 07:32.629
And don't say Einstein was
a patent clerk ... I know.

07:32.659 --> 07:34.709
I thought you hired us
for our creative genius.

07:34.749 --> 07:38.549
Billy! Check it out.
"We are the robots."

07:38.579 --> 07:40.669
Point taken.

07:42.009 --> 07:43.669
Nice.

07:43.669 --> 07:46.169

<i>No. I... My...
Never mind.</i>

- What? Two heads? Go figure.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.839
God is that Redusa?
Ooh I haven't seen her in ages.

09:08.889 --> 09:10.639
<i>She has held up.</i>

09:10.679 --> 09:14.259
- Didn't you two have a thing?
- It was more of a fling.

09:14.259 --> 09:16.929
Insatiable that one.
It got to be murder on my back.

09:16.979 --> 09:22.439
Hot. You should go talk to her.
I could be your winged man.

09:22.439 --> 09:25.939
Get you another? What are

09:31.579 --> 09:33.749
Oh you're way past okay bright eyes.

09:33.779 --> 09:36.499
That heavenly body could
make the Moon jealous.

09:36.539 --> 09:40.589
Mm. Yes.
I'm just waiting for my... husband.

09:40.619 --> 09:44.039
Ooh it ain't like that Lady M.
This here's a business call.

09:44.089 --> 09:45.959
<i>Not that it ain't a pleasure.</i>

Name's Copy Cat.
Maybe think of me next time

09:48.379 --> 09:51.849
your tribal council's having
a pow-wow about new members.

09:51.879 --> 09:53.469
I'm not sure we need someone

09:53.469 --> 09:55.719
who his superpower seems
to be bad pickup lines.

09:55.769 --> 09:58.519
Well I'm a man of many
talents but my best one

09:58.559 --> 10:00.979
is being in the right
place at the right time.

10:01.029 --> 10:04.029
A talent I wish my
husband shared about now.

10:04.059 --> 10:06.649
If you'll excuse me
I think I need some fresh air.

10:06.649 --> 10:09.699
<i>You go on now.

What's eating you tadpole?
Ain't I made a nice party for you?

10:19.829 --> 10:22.879

party with no foo-foo food.

- Regrettably this is my face sir.
- And you bear it with dignity old friend.

12:14.189 --> 12:16.439
You be proud of that face.
But you!

12:16.469 --> 12:19.889
You get the hell out of my house
before I throw you out.

12:19.939 --> 12:24.479
Hey no need for a scene there Mr.
Clean. My pad's right downstairs.

12:24.529 --> 12:27.279
How about I swing
Mr. Monarch on down there

12:27.319 --> 12:31.149
and tune him up proper like
with some appropriate attire.

12:32.989 --> 12:34.909
Whoa. Oh yeah.

12:34.959 --> 12:38.459
- Oh god. How long has it been Red?
- I think she wants to go all the way.

12:38.499 --> 12:40.969
Thanks for saving me back
there man. The wife would

12:40.969 --> 12:43.499
kill me if I made a scene
in front of her work friends.

12:43.549 --> 12:48.499
Oh... hell hath no fury eh tomcat?

12:52.089 --> 12:56.759
- Come on.
- Why so gloomy sweet perfumy?

12:56.759 --> 12:59.099
Hubby still a no-show?

13:04.189 --> 13:07.019
- Well?
- Ah geez Dean.

13:07.069 --> 13:10.939
- Your essay reads like a suicide note.
- Everything I wrote was true!

13:10.999 --> 13:13.609
Yeah but you got to turn the
gas down a notch Sylvia Plath.

13:13.609 --> 13:16.049
You're supposed to be selling
yourself to these people.

13:16.079 --> 13:18.679
- Well h-how do I do that?
- Like right here ... instead of

13:18.719 --> 13:22.419
"dragged all over kingdom come
by my super-controlling father"

13:22.459 --> 13:25.359
you could write something like
"experienced world traveler."

13:25.389 --> 13:27.629
And instead of "never let
me go to a 'real school'"

13:27.659 --> 13:29.329
just say you were homeschooled.

13:29.359 --> 13:32.599
In an electronic learning bed
that locked from the outside.

13:32.629 --> 13:35.769
Better yet a very
exclusive progressive school

13:35.799 --> 13:38.039
where you had a perfect
attendance record.

13:38.069 --> 13:41.309
- So you want me to lie.
- Eh it's called spin. Do you trust me?

13:41.359 --> 13:44.279
I know what I'm talking about.
I work for the government.

13:44.309 --> 13:47.309
W-Wait. You said you'd help me
study for the entrance exams.

13:47.359 --> 13:51.719
- Uhhh... right. When are they?
- Tomorrow... morning?

13:51.749 --> 13:56.819
All right so nothing in the inventory
under "silver goo" or "magic puddle."

13:56.819 --> 13:58.489
Well did you try "robot water"?

13:59.459 --> 14:03.299
<i>- Uh nada.
- Okay you geniuses can stop guessing now.</i>

14:03.329 --> 14:08.299
I've got the inventory number right here.
VT-005-BB.

14:08.339 --> 14:11.339
All right.
Here we go. Bingo.

14:11.369 --> 14:15.739
Ven-Tech bio-bot series 5.
They're uh some kind of nanobots.

14:15.779 --> 14:19.539
Aha!
Technically I guessed closest.

14:19.579 --> 14:21.679
<i>Eh I don't know
what Wide Wale's problem is</i>

14:21.679 --> 14:24.249
<i>but I'm glad you're not
one of these stuck-up</i>

14:24.249 --> 14:26.689
<i>New York supervillains.
This is so super-cool of you.</i>

14:26.739 --> 14:28.689
Oh think nothing of it doodlebug.

14:28.739 --> 14:31.569
Sure you don't mind?
It's like really expensive.

14:31.609 --> 14:34.239
<i>Mi closet es su closet compadre.</i>

14:34.279 --> 14:35.689
Really should wear more suits.

14:35.699 --> 14:38.529
<i>You know what they say...
clothes make the man.</i>

14:38.529 --> 14:41.199
I don't know about that.
I mean a guy like you ...

14:41.199 --> 14:43.289
I'll say it ... classically handsome.

14:43.339 --> 14:45.419
<i>Come on now buddy
not so bad yourself.</i>

14:45.459 --> 14:47.669
Thanks. But you ...

14:47.709 --> 14:49.459
you'd probably look good in anything.

14:49.509 --> 14:52.389
<i>See? You even make that look great!</i>

15:00.139 --> 15:05.219
Aw what is this now?
Unh-unh don't even try it Monarch.

15:05.229 --> 15:07.729
Just turn around walk on out of here.

15:09.699 --> 15:12.649
Warning you Monarch ...
one more jazzy little step

15:12.699 --> 15:14.779
and I'll ... you get some
work done on your face?

15:14.819 --> 15:17.809
No but you're about to.

15:21.239 --> 15:24.129
What is this?
What are you playing video games now?

15:24.159 --> 15:26.709
- I told you to find those things!
- It's not a video game.

15:26.749 --> 15:30.419
- We found a tutorial for the bio-bot.
- It's pretty amazing Rus.

15:30.469 --> 15:33.249
They're like a million tiny
doctors who are always on call.

15:33.249 --> 15:36.169
You just drive 'em anywhere
you want in the body. See?

15:37.669 --> 15:40.229
<i>If two sides of a triangle...</i>

15:40.259 --> 15:43.729
...have lengths of 5 and 6
the perimeter of the triangle

15:43.759 --> 15:48.599
could be which of the following?
"A" 11; "B" 24...

15:51.659 --> 15:54.319
It uh... it was "C" 15.

15:54.359 --> 15:55.739
Do you need to take
a break or something?

15:55.779 --> 15:58.579
And ... Boom! ... just
like that all secured.

15:58.609 --> 16:02.609
- Huh. Okay that is pretty amazing.
- Yeah but why stop there huh?

16:02.619 --> 16:05.779
Why just cure people
when you can improve them?

16:05.789 --> 16:08.789
Stimulate the muscles give
the adrenal glands a shot.

16:08.839 --> 16:11.459
You can make a man virtually superhuman.

16:11.459 --> 16:14.459
No no my stomach's
pretty much better now.

16:14.459 --> 16:15.839
Actually I feel pretty ...

16:15.879 --> 16:18.929
<i>Yeah but that starts to raise</i>

16:18.929 --> 16:19.769
some ethical questions.

16:19.799 --> 16:21.799
And what if this technology
falls into the wrong hands huh?

16:21.799 --> 16:24.799
With a touch of a button you
could like stop a guy's heart.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.719
Hoo!

16:28.439 --> 16:31.689
Yeah but in the right hands
could just start it right up again.

16:32.719 --> 16:34.699
Come on Dean! Come on!

16:36.899 --> 16:39.819
Just think what these puppies could do
with the human brain.

16:39.849 --> 16:41.519
Just park them in the cerebral cortex

16:41.559 --> 16:43.359
hook them up to the
internet and ... bam ...

16:43.389 --> 16:46.559
You're reading like "Gilgamesh"
in the original Babylonian.

16:51.489 --> 16:53.719
What the hell...?

16:54.799 --> 16:56.799
Ah too highbrow.

16:56.839 --> 16:59.499
It's more fun to just make
a guy totally crap himself huh?

16:59.559 --> 17:03.019
Okay tour's over folks. Now
can this tutorial of yours tutor you

17:03.019 --> 17:06.598
how to find the real bio-whats
and call them back or something?

17:06.648 --> 17:09.679
Oh yeah well sure.
It's no problem.

17:09.679 --> 17:12.729
Huh. They're uh...
they're not responding.

17:23.579 --> 17:26.949
<i>I just think he feels threatened
by my new position in the Guild</i>

17:26.999 --> 17:30.499
<i>and it comes out in these
passive-aggressive little ways.</i>

17:30.539 --> 17:34.209
Like tonight I mean it's almost
midnight already and where is he?

17:34.259 --> 17:37.839
- Holy mackerel. Speak of the devil.
- What you see him? I-Is he here?

17:37.879 --> 17:41.349
No he's across the way over
in that there Venture pad.

17:41.379 --> 17:44.679
Oh that's impossible. He knows
he's not allowed to arch a Venture.

17:44.719 --> 17:47.389
Don't know if I'd call
that arching per se.

17:48.689 --> 17:50.559
<i>Classy bird there this Monarch.</i>

17:50.559 --> 17:52.439
<i>Does he do this kind of thing a lot?</i>

17:52.479 --> 17:55.689
More than I care to admit.

17:59.699 --> 18:02.479
Did he just ... oh no you didn't.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.399
You know your husband's
got a real talent

18:04.399 --> 18:08.709
- for ignoring Guild arch rights.
- To say nothing of basic hygiene.

18:08.739 --> 18:13.269
I... I think I'm...
gonna call it a night.

18:22.259 --> 18:25.639
<i>You guys check the back bedrooms.
I'm gonna check the hall again.</i>

18:29.009 --> 18:32.929
<i>- Oh! Your tongue dear.
- Oh yeah make the earth move.</i>

18:32.979 --> 18:35.519
<i>- Bring it to me!
- Ow! What the heck?!</i>

18:35.519 --> 18:37.789
<i>Take your godamn tongue outta my...</i>

18:38.989 --> 18:43.319
Redusa don't do threesomes
you fucking perverts!

18:43.319 --> 18:46.409
Redusa wait! Wait!
I can put a bag over his head!

18:46.449 --> 18:48.409
<i>You must understand! Please!</i>

18:48.449 --> 18:50.779
- I got nothing. Jiggle it.
- Stop talking to me like I'm an idiot.

18:50.829 --> 18:52.669
- Billy jiggle it.
- I'm jiggling the damn part.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.749
What are you doing down there?!

18:54.789 --> 18:56.369
<i>Doc! Call Dr. Orpheus.</i>

18:56.419 --> 18:58.419
<i>I'm pretty sure Dean is possessed!</i>

18:58.459 --> 19:00.589
What? Poss... grow up Brock.

19:00.629 --> 19:02.679
He's probably just
nervous about his exams.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.349
Yeah well nerves might explain
him throwing up his dinner

19:05.379 --> 19:08.109
<i>but not throwing me across
the room or how he could</i>

19:08.109 --> 19:10.999
<i>come back from the dead and
start ranting in Babylonian!</i>

19:11.039 --> 19:12.799
Wait. Shh!
What did you say?

19:12.839 --> 19:14.709
Are you sure it was Babylonian?

19:14.739 --> 19:16.439
<i>I don't know.
It could have been Sumerian.</i>

19:16.479 --> 19:19.379
<i>It's not really the takeaway here Doc.
Call the exorcist!</i>

19:20.319 --> 19:21.979
Just calm down Brock.

19:22.019 --> 19:25.979
I think I know what's... possessing him.

19:28.619 --> 19:33.489
What the...
What? Eh?

19:33.539 --> 19:36.489
W-What?
H-Honey! Wait! Hey honey!

19:36.549 --> 19:38.659
Ugh you would not believe
what happened to me ...

19:38.669 --> 19:41.999
Don't! Just don't. Ugh!
I-I can't even look at you.

19:41.999 --> 19:44.469
Don't be so dramatic.
So I'm a little late.

19:44.499 --> 19:47.309
Late? Yes late. You
embarrass me in front

19:47.309 --> 19:50.509
of my co-workers violated
a Guild law yet again

19:50.509 --> 19:52.979
and more importantly
you ignored my call!

19:53.009 --> 19:55.809
What?! Never!
I-I lost my phone when ...

19:55.849 --> 19:58.349
Mmm.

19:59.689 --> 20:00.939
What?

20:00.989 --> 20:02.569
Dude Manolo got the
Morpho-mobile started.

20:02.609 --> 20:05.109
Not now.
I'm having a discussion with my ...

20:06.779 --> 20:09.359
Never mind. Come get me.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.079
<i>Professor!</i>

20:11.109 --> 20:15.029
<i>What did you do to me?
I-I'm disappearing.</i>

20:21.759 --> 20:25.039
- You lost something pizza boy?
- Don't hit me! I was just leav...

20:25.099 --> 20:28.459
- Oh. Hi.
- You're that kid from the park.

20:28.519 --> 20:32.179
- Hey. Hank Vent...
- The one who was peeping in my window last week.

20:32.219 --> 20:35.599
Okay first up I was not peeping.
I was trying to rescue you

20:35.639 --> 20:38.639
didn't know you can breathe underwater.
Side note ... I'm super impressed.

20:38.689 --> 20:41.059
<i>Miss Ong you okay in there?!</i>

20:41.059 --> 20:44.149
- Sirena!
- Uh that'd be me. Hi. I'm Sirena.

20:44.199 --> 20:45.729
<i>Hey hey Miss Ong! You all right?</i>

20:45.779 --> 20:48.149
You know... I am leaving.
Those lobster guys are after me

20:48.199 --> 20:49.779
'cause our dads are
enemies or something.

20:49.819 --> 20:52.739
- They're supposed to be whale lice.
- All right don't worry!

20:52.739 --> 20:54.989
I know t-that's so stupid.
Am I right?

20:55.039 --> 20:56.909
Eh I've run away from stupider.

20:56.959 --> 20:58.739
- Hey what's the matter?
- 3... 2...

20:58.799 --> 21:01.409
You're not willing to risk your
life to go on a date with me?

21:01.469 --> 21:03.749
I can't say I'm too impressed.

21:05.099 --> 21:09.719
- Hail Mary full of grace...
- Okay I'm gonna bust this door down!

21:09.759 --> 21:12.839
- You all right Miss Ong?! You didn't answer.
- Yes Rocco I'm fine!

21:12.889 --> 21:16.929
- I was just getting some fucking air.
- All right I'm sorry to disturb you.

21:16.929 --> 21:19.849
<i>I was very worried.
I was yelling and texting...</i>

21:21.599 --> 21:24.019
Sooo... do we have a date?

21:52.949 --> 21:54.449
No no no no no no no!

21:54.449 --> 21:56.959
<i>Don't fight it boy.
Your body is simply trying</i>

21:56.959 --> 21:58.789
<i>to pass its residual
nanobots through your urethra.</i>

21:58.789 --> 21:59.959
Perfectly natural.

22:00.009 --> 22:01.759
- Ooh!
- Oh and son...

22:01.799 --> 22:03.959
<i> that's not all you passed.</i>

22:03.959 --> 22:07.469
- Really? I got in?!
- Mm-hmm.

22:07.519 --> 22:09.939
All those years in the
learning bed must have paid off.

22:09.969 --> 22:14.309
<i>Well... I also had
a pretty great study buddy.</i>

22:14.359 --> 22:16.559
You sure did son.

22:17.409 --> 22:20.699
Gentlemen I think we just
made our first miracle.

22:20.779 --> 22:23.819
Whoo! High five!
