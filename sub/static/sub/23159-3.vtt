WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:04.960
Unless that ki'i is returned,
all who have touched it are doomed.

00:10.466 --> 00:12.696
Rick, you don't believe the curse.

00:12.735 --> 00:14.794
I'm sure you'll make
an excellent team.

00:14.837 --> 00:18.432
- I sometimes get very lonely. Don't you?
- Sometimes.

00:20.310 --> 00:21.937
Hi, guys.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.674
You're telling us this has got a curse on it?

00:25.748 --> 00:27.773
Something wrong?

00:27.817 --> 00:29.876
This is crazy.

02:43.267 --> 02:44.256
Yes?

02:48.539 --> 02:50.564
May I help you?

02:54.011 --> 02:55.137
Sir?

02:55.179 --> 03:00.116
Uh, you recently purchased a ki'i
from the island of Molokai?

03:00.151 --> 03:04.918
Yes. A statue of Kalai-pahoa,
the Poison-god.

03:04.956 --> 03:08.323
- A beautiful piece.
- It's taken me a long time to trace.

03:08.359 --> 03:10.953
It's probably changed hands many times.

03:10.995 --> 03:14.624
That's common with such pieces.
They're highly sought after.

03:14.665 --> 03:18.533
No, you don't understand.
I found that ki'i in a cave in Wailea.

03:18.569 --> 03:20.594
It's sacred to a great chief.

03:20.638 --> 03:25.632
The kahuna who guards it told me
if I didn't return the ki'i, I would die.

03:26.811 --> 03:28.472
You mean it's cursed?

03:30.414 --> 03:34.077
There is a curse on practically
every piece of native art

03:34.118 --> 03:36.279
from the Pacific Islands...

03:36.320 --> 03:38.880
if you believe in that sort of thing.

03:38.923 --> 03:42.723
Listen! The curse is real.
I can feel it working.

03:42.760 --> 03:46.662
- Just a minute. Take your hands off me.
- I must have that ki'i.

03:46.697 --> 03:48.722
- I don't have it.
- Where is it?

03:48.766 --> 03:51.496
I have to know.
I have to return it to the cave.

03:51.536 --> 03:57.099
That's impossible.
It... was sold while I was on vacation.

03:57.141 --> 03:59.302
By now, it could be anywhere.

03:59.343 --> 04:04.371
Besides, I assure you, that curse
is nothing more than mythology.

04:04.415 --> 04:10.012
Unless that ki'i is returned,
all who have touched it are doomed.

04:33.878 --> 04:34.902
No!

04:34.946 --> 04:37.710
Aargh!

05:12.083 --> 05:14.984
<i>I know it's hard to believe,
but even in paradise,</i>

05:15.019 --> 05:17.214
<i>it's possible to have a bad day</i>.

05:17.255 --> 05:19.246
<i>The nice thing about paradise</i>

05:19.290 --> 05:22.589
<i>is you've got great places
to get away from it all.</i>

05:22.627 --> 05:24.288
<i>For me, it's the water</i>.

05:24.328 --> 05:28.856
<i>Sitting on my surf ski 100 yards
offshore is like being in another world.</i>

05:28.900 --> 05:30.891
<i>It's quiet and calm</i>

05:30.935 --> 05:34.996
<i>and there's a lot of space
between me and anyone on the island.</i>

05:35.039 --> 05:37.030
<i>It's a nice safe feeling</i>.

05:37.074 --> 05:40.407
<i>But even paradise has its share of hassles,</i>

05:40.444 --> 05:44.312
<i>but if I can't forget them here,
at least I can see them coming.</i>

05:44.348 --> 05:46.612
- Hello, Catherine.
- Jonathan.

05:46.651 --> 05:50.678
I have found something so special
for the auction. Dennis?

05:50.721 --> 05:52.586
You've already done so much.

05:52.623 --> 05:55.922
Oh, nonsense! This orphanage
is very important to me.

05:58.162 --> 06:00.596
Wait till you see this.

06:10.741 --> 06:12.868
What a magnificent ki'i.

06:13.577 --> 06:15.875
It's Kalai-pahoa, I believe.

06:15.913 --> 06:19.940
Right. The Poison-god.
He is ominous-looking, isn't he?

06:20.451 --> 06:25.912
This is one of the few of its kind left
still privately owned.

06:25.957 --> 06:28.482
I think it'll do very nicely for us.

06:28.526 --> 06:31.518
- The rest of the items will arrive tomorrow.
- Fine.

06:31.562 --> 06:34.122
- About security...
- I've got somebody in mind.

06:34.165 --> 06:39.831
I hope he's not too expensive.
You know how thin our budget is.

06:39.870 --> 06:42.862
No, no. Not to worry.
He's quite reasonable.

06:42.907 --> 06:43.931
Oh.

06:43.975 --> 06:47.308
Well, do you have someplace safe
to store the ki'i?

06:47.345 --> 06:48.869
Yes. Put it in the den.

06:48.913 --> 06:52.610
I'll get my security expert
and join you on the patio.

06:52.650 --> 06:56.313
Don't take long. We've got
a million details to work out.

06:56.354 --> 06:58.345
A minute, I promise.

07:09.533 --> 07:12.024
I say, Magnum.

07:12.069 --> 07:15.561
Higgins... you'll be interested in this.

07:16.574 --> 07:18.701
The strangest thing just happened.

07:18.743 --> 07:23.646
I was sailing along, as slick as you please,
and all of a sudden, I just fell off.

07:23.681 --> 07:28.175
It was weird. Then I couldn't get back on.
It's interesting, isn't it?

07:29.887 --> 07:33.118
Magnum, I keep hoping
that at some propitious juncture

07:33.157 --> 07:36.854
you'll see there are more important things
than aquatic pursuits.

07:36.894 --> 07:39.385
Forget it. Nice set of wheels.

07:39.430 --> 07:43.457
A Rolls-Royce is considerably more
than a nice set of wheels.

07:43.501 --> 07:46.163
- Who does it belong to?
- Catherine Hailey.

07:46.203 --> 07:51.038
Co-chair of the Makahu Orphanage auction,
taking place here on the 5th.

07:51.075 --> 07:55.273
She's a lovely lady, a tireless worker
and an expert on Hawaiian art,

07:55.312 --> 07:59.908
which is perfect as Hawaiian culture
is the theme of the auction.

07:59.950 --> 08:02.612
We have items from all over the island.

08:02.653 --> 08:05.121
- The auction's on the 5th, right?
- Yes.

08:05.156 --> 08:09.650
And there'll be all sorts of people -
blue blood and all that?

08:09.693 --> 08:12.093
Which is why I want to talk to you.

08:12.129 --> 08:15.098
Don't bother. I know
what you're going to say.

08:15.132 --> 08:16.759
- You do?
- Sure.

08:16.801 --> 08:19.964
You don't want
to seem impolite or insensitive,

08:20.004 --> 08:23.030
but you'd rather I made
myself scarce on the day,

08:23.074 --> 08:27.067
in exchange for which you will
make some minor concession

08:27.111 --> 08:30.808
regarding the car or the wine cellar
or the tennis court, right?

08:32.416 --> 08:35.283
Sometimes you amaze me,
Magnum, truly.

08:35.318 --> 08:39.380
Your intuitive grasp
of human nature is so... so...

08:39.423 --> 08:41.857
- Perceptive?
- Pre-adolescent.

08:44.395 --> 08:48.456
You can relax, Higgins.
I will be gone all day.

08:48.499 --> 08:49.761
Oh?

08:49.800 --> 08:51.062
Yes.

08:51.102 --> 08:55.095
The 5th is the annual surf ski race
from Kahuku to Punaluu.

08:55.139 --> 08:57.835
I'll be gone and it
won't cost you a thing.

08:59.577 --> 09:04.810
Actually, I was hoping for your presence
at the auction. Planning on it, in fact.

09:07.118 --> 09:08.107
What?

09:08.152 --> 09:10.916
Mr. Masters is extremely
concerned, as am I,

09:10.955 --> 09:14.618
that we have first-rate security here
for the next few days.

09:14.658 --> 09:18.150
- He's made a very generous donation.
- What?

09:18.195 --> 09:21.460
You. Starting tomorrow morning.

09:21.499 --> 09:25.560
Higgins, that isn't fair.
Come on, I got a race.

09:26.103 --> 09:27.934
Higgins, I got a race.

09:27.972 --> 09:31.408
Are you afraid
this is a bit more than you can handle?

09:31.442 --> 09:36.243
All it takes is a security check
at the gate and some extra manpower.

09:36.280 --> 09:40.182
That's very impressive.
I'm Catherine Hailey, Mr...?

09:41.218 --> 09:42.708
Magnum. Thomas Magnum.

09:43.420 --> 09:46.218
You must be the security expert
Jonathan mentioned.

09:46.257 --> 09:49.249
What were you saying
about extra manpower?

09:49.293 --> 09:54.424
Well, I'll probably use my usual
associates. A hand-picked crew.

09:56.967 --> 09:59.993
- How reliable are they?
- Very.

10:00.037 --> 10:03.336
To make you feel better,
I'll run checks on everyone.

10:03.374 --> 10:06.343
- Everyone?
- Yes. Outside and in - even on you.

10:06.377 --> 10:11.371
- Come now, Magnum.
- No, Jonathan, he's quite right.

10:11.415 --> 10:14.578
I'm very impressed with
Mr. Magnum's thoroughness.

10:14.618 --> 10:20.079
In fact, perhaps we could discuss it...
over dinner tonight.

10:20.124 --> 10:23.958
- Oh, I'm sorry. I have other plans.
- Nothing that can't be changed.

10:23.994 --> 10:27.725
I'm sure you'll make
an excellent team. Come, Catherine.

10:32.269 --> 10:34.260
- Nice meeting you.
- Dennis.

10:36.340 --> 10:37.864
Big.

10:39.944 --> 10:43.277
<i>Working for the auction</i>
<i>didn't bother me.</i> .. <i>not that much,</i>

10:43.314 --> 10:46.408
<i>but I didn't like how Higgins
had approached me.</i>

10:46.450 --> 10:49.578
<i>There's a right and wrong way
to ask for a favor,</i>

10:49.620 --> 10:52.180
<i>especially when dealing with friends</i>.

10:52.223 --> 10:56.887
<i>The right way is done directly
with some consideration and diplomacy.</i>

10:56.927 --> 11:01.330
<i>It's honest and it's straightforward
and that's why it always works.</i>

11:01.365 --> 11:03.458
No way, Thomas.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.800
Come on, guys.
It's two days. Three at the most.

11:07.838 --> 11:11.399
Are you kidding? 15 minutes around
Higgins and I start to break out.

11:11.442 --> 11:13.774
Yeah, but this is a good cause.

11:13.811 --> 11:16.678
Yeah, right.
The Thomas Magnum Relief Fund.

11:16.714 --> 11:18.272
Mm-hmm.

11:18.315 --> 11:20.146
Ten. I'll take mine again.

11:20.184 --> 11:24.518
Man, I'm taking care
of the best cause I know - me.

11:24.555 --> 11:28.889
I got this fox coming in
from Los Angeles, man. Ooh!

11:28.926 --> 11:32.123
Two days, three nights in Honolulu.

11:33.297 --> 11:36.266
- Sounds like a vacation package.
- Yep, mine.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.699
Pass.

11:38.702 --> 11:40.499
OK.

11:40.537 --> 11:43.335
I just figured I'd ask.

11:43.374 --> 11:46.639
You guys would understand
what this means

11:46.677 --> 11:50.135
and say, "Sure, I'd like
to help those kids."

11:51.315 --> 11:53.613
I mean, that's what I thought you'd say,

11:53.651 --> 11:57.087
but... I guess I was wrong.

11:58.622 --> 12:01.523
- It wouldn't be the first time.
- Come on, Thomas.

12:01.558 --> 12:05.961
Get off that guilt trip.
That's the oldest con in the books.

12:05.996 --> 12:10.296
Yeah, and what do you mean,
"It wouldn't be the first time"?

12:10.334 --> 12:13.565
I promised you a long time ago
I'd never mention that.

12:13.604 --> 12:16.698
- Mention what? What did Orville do?
- Wait a minute.

12:16.740 --> 12:19.368
It's something that happened in Saigon,

12:19.410 --> 12:22.379
but I promised Rick I'd never mention it.

12:25.749 --> 12:27.876
What was that snake lady's name?

12:27.918 --> 12:30.318
That's not fair, Thomas, it's really not.

12:30.354 --> 12:32.618
- What's not fair?
- It's personal.

12:32.656 --> 12:37.320
It's funny. It's like what happened
to you that time at Madam Wu's.

12:37.361 --> 12:40.387
That sword-swallower
from the Lotus Festival?

12:40.431 --> 12:42.524
Ah!

12:47.104 --> 12:48.799
What do you think?

12:48.839 --> 12:50.363
What do I think?

12:52.476 --> 12:54.467
I think it's a piece of cake.

12:57.147 --> 13:01.015
- How are you feeling?
- Worse. Much worse.

13:01.051 --> 13:04.714
I... I can't believe this is happening to me.

13:04.755 --> 13:08.213
Well, don't worry about it.
We'll get the ki'i back.

13:08.258 --> 13:11.056
You hired the right guys, Harold.

13:11.095 --> 13:13.495
It'll be like picking pineapples off a tree.

13:15.499 --> 13:19.333
- Pineapples don't grow on trees.
- Figure of speech, A.J.

14:04.046 --> 14:07.015
- Great show.
- Mm-hmm.

14:08.917 --> 14:11.818
I'm sorry you had to
change your plans tonight.

14:11.853 --> 14:15.983
I didn't have any plans.
I just like to be asked, not ordered.

14:16.024 --> 14:18.356
I didn't mean it as an order.

14:18.393 --> 14:21.851
I wasn't talking about you.
I was referring to Higgins.

14:24.833 --> 14:25.822
See this?

14:28.270 --> 14:31.034
This is a replica of
the rice god, Monowana.

14:31.073 --> 14:34.372
The natives used to believe
that rice was raindrops

14:34.409 --> 14:36.400
that had been blessed by the god,

14:36.445 --> 14:39.346
so they had to be careful
how they worshipped him,

14:39.381 --> 14:42.214
because if they didn't
do it exactly right...

14:42.250 --> 14:45.845
they'd never get food... just wet.

14:47.856 --> 14:50.051
- Really?
- Mm.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.919
- Monowana?
- Mm-hmm.

14:55.564 --> 14:56.861
There is no rice god.

14:59.568 --> 15:03.470
In fact, there wasn't any rice
until the Chinese brought it in.

15:04.673 --> 15:07.642
Think you're real smart, don't you?

15:09.411 --> 15:12.972
I know it wasn't a very good story,
but you could smile.

15:17.219 --> 15:19.881
Where'd you learn
about Hawaiian culture?

15:19.921 --> 15:22.651
It's amazing what
you pick up collecting.

15:22.691 --> 15:26.320
- Like the ki'i?
- Yeah, like the ki'i.

15:28.096 --> 15:31.259
- It is lovely, isn't it?
- Higgins showed it to me.

15:31.967 --> 15:34.993
I guess lovely is
in the eyes of the beholder.

15:37.339 --> 15:39.466
Is there something wrong?

15:40.575 --> 15:42.566
Uh, just a little dizzy.

15:47.949 --> 15:50.213
It just seems to be happening lately.

15:51.386 --> 15:56.449
It's funny how you always seem to work
harder when you're not getting paid.

15:56.491 --> 15:59.824
I'm sure it'll go away
after the auction tomorrow.

15:59.861 --> 16:03.297
- You're sure you're OK?
- I'm fine.

16:04.699 --> 16:06.496
Really. It's better.

16:08.303 --> 16:10.430
Let's see. Where was I? Oh.

16:10.472 --> 16:12.702
Where'd you get the ki'i?

16:15.510 --> 16:20.004
I bought it, from a woman in
Los Angeles named Alex Huston.

16:20.048 --> 16:23.381
She collects pre-Colombian,
so I got a good price.

16:23.418 --> 16:26.353
L.A.? Is that where you're from?

16:27.989 --> 16:29.422
Sometimes.

16:30.559 --> 16:34.893
Somehow I get the distinct feeling
we are not getting off on the best foot.

16:34.930 --> 16:38.798
No. I'm just doing my job, Miss Hailey.

16:39.568 --> 16:40.557
And so am I.

16:40.602 --> 16:44.470
If we're gonna work together,
I don't want tension between us.

16:47.075 --> 16:52.240
- That sounds reasonable.
- Things can be a lot simpler that way.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.874
Why did you want to have dinner with me?

16:56.084 --> 16:59.485
- I just wanted to discuss the auction.
- And?

16:59.521 --> 17:03.048
And despite some material advantages...

17:04.059 --> 17:06.391
I sometimes get very lonely.

17:07.395 --> 17:08.384
Don't you?

17:10.732 --> 17:11.993
Sometimes.

17:14.102 --> 17:16.002
But never on a case.

17:38.193 --> 17:41.219
I don't have a good feeling about this.

17:41.263 --> 17:43.254
There's gotta be a legal way.

17:43.298 --> 17:46.734
If we go to the police,
they're gonna impound the ki'i.

17:46.768 --> 17:50.363
Sands is feeling worse by the minute.
He looks terrible.

17:50.405 --> 17:52.703
Rick, you don't believe that curse stuff.

17:52.741 --> 17:57.405
No, but he does and the sooner we get it
back to him, the better he'll feel.

17:57.445 --> 18:00.937
- That'll be one of us.
- Oh, come on. Just relax.

18:02.117 --> 18:05.575
Every time you say "relax" to me,
I get into trouble.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.350
- What if we get caught?
- We won't get caught.

18:08.390 --> 18:11.120
Imagine what the jails are like here.

18:11.159 --> 18:13.150
I don't like macadamia nuts.

18:13.194 --> 18:15.788
We are not gonna get caught.

18:15.830 --> 18:20.130
Anyway, how tough can it be?
This is Hawaii. Aloha.

18:34.549 --> 18:37.518
"I smiled modestly
as the Duke shook my hand

18:37.552 --> 18:39.850
"and thanked me for a job well done."

18:39.888 --> 18:42.516
"I had looked forward
to a well-earned vacation."

18:42.557 --> 18:45.355
"However, as I turned away,
I heard the words,"

18:45.393 --> 18:47.987
"'We have some trouble in Patagonia.'"

18:48.029 --> 18:51.294
"Needless to say, I didn't unpack."

19:07.782 --> 19:09.113
Come, lads.

19:21.763 --> 19:26.291
- Who the blazes are you?
- I seem to have set something off here.

19:26.334 --> 19:28.461
May I ask what you're doing here?

19:28.503 --> 19:31.836
Yeah. I'm Schuster.
Al Schuster. Cando, North Dakota.

19:31.873 --> 19:34.068
I'm glad to see a friendly face.

19:34.109 --> 19:37.169
Me and the little woman
were driving for an hour...

19:37.212 --> 19:41.171
She's asleep in the back of the car.
She's so tired, poor thing.

19:41.216 --> 19:44.344
We've been driving around
trying to find y'all.

19:46.054 --> 19:49.319
It's our first vacation over the water.
It's exciting.

19:49.357 --> 19:53.987
I think we'll just hit the hammocks
and skip the comp dinner...

19:54.029 --> 19:57.624
- Hammocks?
- Yeah, the... hammocks...

19:59.300 --> 20:01.962
This is the Kahaluna Resort, isn't it?

20:02.003 --> 20:05.905
It certainly is not. Would you mind
taking your hands off the gate?

20:05.940 --> 20:06.929
Oh.

20:16.184 --> 20:18.152
OK. Let's see...

20:19.320 --> 20:22.255
Here we go. Kahaluna Resort, right there.

20:22.290 --> 20:24.724
That map's been out of date for years.

20:24.759 --> 20:28.661
They tore the Kahaluna down
back in '68, I believe.

20:28.697 --> 20:33.225
I recall escorting Clive Jackson-Parr
and his lovely wife Astrid there.

20:33.268 --> 20:36.999
It had a chemin de fer table
equal to anything in Monte Carlo.

20:37.038 --> 20:39.905
I was quite a chemi player myself.

20:39.941 --> 20:42.409
I've passed the shoe to the best of them.

20:42.444 --> 20:46.380
I remember playing with Ferdinand ll -
a rather sore loser who...

20:51.886 --> 20:54.855
He was of the nobility as far as
the peerage was concerned,

20:54.889 --> 20:58.552
but the police still thought...

20:58.593 --> 21:00.458
Excuse me.

21:20.448 --> 21:23.144
What is it, lads?

21:34.129 --> 21:36.120
Come, lads.

21:36.164 --> 21:38.860
It never used to be like this
in the old days.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.893
It used to be girls in grass skirts
and surfing, rum drinks with umbrellas,

21:42.937 --> 21:45.906
now it's Dobermans,
security systems, barbed wire.

21:45.940 --> 21:47.703
They call this paradise!

21:47.742 --> 21:53.112
This is Hawaii - Jewel of the Pacific,
Land of Enchantment.

21:53.148 --> 21:55.139
That's New Mexico.

21:56.351 --> 22:00.185
I'm telling you, Higgins, I checked.
There's nobody there.

22:00.221 --> 22:05.284
Someone was here. They tried to breach
security while you were dallying.

22:05.326 --> 22:08.159
Dallying? It was your idea
to take Catherine out,

22:08.196 --> 22:12.360
even though socializing with a client
is against my professional ethics.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.868
Hardly a client - she's a friend.

22:14.903 --> 22:16.894
I wasn't dallying.

22:18.773 --> 22:20.764
Something's burning.

22:26.414 --> 22:28.405
Get it outside.

22:32.187 --> 22:34.178
Must've been a short circuit.

22:35.356 --> 22:38.757
It's a pity to have lost
that beautiful Mulahuni.

22:38.793 --> 22:42.194
- Magnum, the ki'i. Where is it?
- It's right there.

22:42.230 --> 22:43.891
Oh, there it is.

22:48.503 --> 22:53.167
- I swear that's not where I left it.
- Oh, come on, Higgins.

22:53.208 --> 22:58.271
I'll take care of things. Get some rest.
This auction is starting to get to you.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.649
Perhaps you're right.
You will mend that circuit in the morning?

23:03.685 --> 23:06.654
Higgins, everything is under control.

23:28.276 --> 23:31.643
<i>After I cleaned up the living room,
I went right to sleep</i>

23:31.679 --> 23:34.147
<i>and had a very strange dream</i>.

23:34.182 --> 23:38.380
<i>Higgins was auctioning me off
to a group of smoking ki'is.</i>

23:38.419 --> 23:41.786
<i>No one was bidding
and Higgins couldn't give me away.</i>

23:41.823 --> 23:45.224
<i>Finally, Catherine stood up
and took me off their hands.</i>

23:45.260 --> 23:49.026
<i>She was just about to put me
in a bank vault when I woke up.</i>

23:50.164 --> 23:53.497
<i>I was gonna be glad
when this whole thing was over.</i>

23:54.736 --> 23:57.364
- Yeah?
- Will-Kill pest control.

23:57.405 --> 24:00.169
- Yeah, so what do you want?
- You're kidding?

24:00.208 --> 24:02.836
Are you sure you got
the right address?

24:02.877 --> 24:08.509
I've been protecting this place
for three years and I phoned ahead.

24:08.549 --> 24:11.916
- I don't got all day...
- OK, OK, keep your lid on.

24:11.953 --> 24:13.215
Hey, Higgins!

24:14.255 --> 24:16.018
Must we shout?

24:16.791 --> 24:18.816
Some guy has some spraying to do.

24:18.860 --> 24:23.593
Send him in. I'll be at the main house
momentarily to supervise.

24:25.433 --> 24:27.526
OK. Spray away, Jose.

24:28.136 --> 24:29.763
Yo.

24:34.175 --> 24:37.633
"Strip wire A
and then connect to terminal."

24:40.114 --> 24:44.107
"Do not touch wire B
until terminal is connected."

24:47.188 --> 24:49.748
I hope you're... wire A.

24:55.697 --> 24:57.858
What are you doing?

24:57.899 --> 25:00.834
What does it look like? I'm spraying C-17.

25:00.868 --> 25:05.134
I can't wait all day on that repair.
All we need is another fire.

25:05.173 --> 25:06.902
Higgins, who is this guy?

25:06.941 --> 25:11.344
They spray every six months, in the morning
when the real world doesn't exist for you.

25:11.379 --> 25:15.281
- Why didn't you check with me first?
- Check with you?

25:15.316 --> 25:17.682
Maintenance is my responsibility.

25:17.719 --> 25:20.813
I don't want him spraying
while the auct...

25:23.091 --> 25:25.924
- It's on the beach.
- I'll go with you.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.951
No. You watch the house.

25:30.365 --> 25:33.960
- Thomas, that lady I was telling...
- I need your help.

25:34.002 --> 25:37.199
But what about my date?
Wait a minute.

25:38.306 --> 25:41.036
Just spray the base board.

25:45.713 --> 25:50.207
I've been doing this for ten years and
somebody always wants to give pointers.

25:54.455 --> 25:58.255
If you're going to stand there,
I'm going to get another mask.

25:58.292 --> 26:00.351
Why - is it dangerous?

26:00.395 --> 26:04.024
Are you an ant? If you're an ant, it's fatal.

26:04.065 --> 26:06.192
If you're not, you just get sick.

26:06.234 --> 26:09.931
You get sick, I get fired
and there goes six years of college.

26:13.307 --> 26:17.334
- I'm gonna get another mask.
- No. Just... hurry, please.

26:17.378 --> 26:18.868
Right.

26:30.558 --> 26:32.025
Hey.

26:33.294 --> 26:35.285
Forgot your sunscreen.

26:35.329 --> 26:39.322
No, man. I never use sunscreen -
not when I'm surfing, you know?

26:39.367 --> 26:41.232
You're not surfing.

26:42.170 --> 26:45.139
- Why not?
- Because there's no surf.

26:47.308 --> 26:48.639
Oh.

26:49.310 --> 26:51.369
You touch that fence?

26:51.412 --> 26:56.076
Gee, man, I don't know.
Maybe my surfboard. Maybe I...

27:34.222 --> 27:38.090
- Who turned you onto this place?
- Oh, Big Jimbo.

27:38.126 --> 27:42.222
You know Big Jimbo off at Sunset Beach?
Big Jimbo, huh?

27:43.798 --> 27:46.926
Hey, he never said anything
about private, man.

27:46.968 --> 27:50.529
That goes to show you can't believe
everything Big Jimbo says.

27:50.571 --> 27:52.835
He's never been wrong before.

27:52.874 --> 27:55.468
Maybe I'll cruise on
back up to Sunset...

27:55.510 --> 28:00.470
and check out and see
what he says next.

28:01.015 --> 28:02.915
Hey... hang loose, bro.

28:02.950 --> 28:04.212
Huh?

28:19.500 --> 28:23.493
- You through already?
- How long does it take to kill some ants?

28:23.538 --> 28:25.199
See ya.

28:33.347 --> 28:36.839
How much longer is this going to...?

28:45.126 --> 28:47.094
Oh, my God!

29:06.362 --> 29:10.128
- Thomas, I'm sorry.
- Higgins cleared it. Which way did he go?

29:10.165 --> 29:14.101
He went left. Hey, I'll try
and find out about the van.

29:27.216 --> 29:29.548
What the hell's wrong with this thing?

30:10.392 --> 30:11.950
There it is.

30:34.450 --> 30:37.419
- Come on.
- Come on? What are we after now?

30:38.554 --> 30:40.613
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

30:40.656 --> 30:45.355
We're gonna stop all the cars
on Kalakaua Drive lookin' for a ki'i.

30:45.394 --> 30:50.161
"If you'll just open your trunk. We wanna
see if you have a poison-god in there."

31:06.048 --> 31:09.575
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hey there, yourself.

31:20.529 --> 31:24.363
Hey, guys. Hang ten, huh?
How's it going?

31:26.702 --> 31:28.693
Thought you were going up to Sunset.

31:28.737 --> 31:34.198
Oh, yeah, man. Like, I was
gonna go there or maybe Mahaki.

31:34.243 --> 31:37.235
These are heavy decisions, huh?

31:37.279 --> 31:39.270
Maybe you oughta ask Big Jimbo.

31:39.314 --> 31:43.648
Yeah. I was thinking
I might cruise on into Honolulu.

31:43.685 --> 31:48.713
Talk to Big Jimbo or Lola -
this girl, you should see her hang ten.

31:48.757 --> 31:52.090
- You could use some wax.
- It's a rented car.

31:52.127 --> 31:55.028
Not the car, the board, hotshot.

31:55.063 --> 31:58.692
- It's a rented board, y'know what I mean?
- Uh, Thomas!

31:58.734 --> 32:01.567
- Hold it right there.
- Thomas.

32:14.616 --> 32:16.208
Wax that, hotshot.

32:17.553 --> 32:19.714
Shall we go? Thank you.

32:25.294 --> 32:27.057
Aloha!

32:40.943 --> 32:44.811
- This thing gives me the creeps.
- You sound like Harold.

33:14.543 --> 33:19.105
Ladies and gentlemen, there's been
a small change in the items for auction.

33:19.147 --> 33:22.913
Number 34, the Hawaiian folk-art
sculpture of the Kalai-pahoa

33:22.951 --> 33:25.351
has been removed from the bidding.

33:25.387 --> 33:28.652
We're sorry for the disappointment
and inconvenience.

33:28.690 --> 33:33.923
Let us begin with this rare and valuable
Louis XV ladies' writing desk,

33:33.962 --> 33:37.989
graciously donated
by Eleanor Hastings-Boyle of Kahala.

33:38.033 --> 33:40.024
Shall we start the bidding at 1,000?

33:45.374 --> 33:46.966
950...

33:50.579 --> 33:53.707
Mabel, would you mind
taking over for a moment?

34:01.256 --> 34:04.555
I believe that Jonathan said
he wanted a thousand

34:04.593 --> 34:08.120
and that piece is definitely a thousand.

34:08.163 --> 34:12.896
Yeah, that's great, Mousey. Thanks.
What? Look me up when you get out.

34:12.934 --> 34:13.922
Anything?

34:13.969 --> 34:17.871
The Will-Kill van was snatched
when the driver went to get a donut.

34:17.906 --> 34:20.170
We got the license number.
It's a rental.

34:20.208 --> 34:23.234
Do I look like the DMV?
This could take hours.

34:23.277 --> 34:26.110
- This isn't pulling rabbits out of a hat.
- Rick...

34:26.148 --> 34:28.878
- Magnum.
- Uh-oh, I think I need some coffee.

34:28.917 --> 34:33.320
You look even more vacuous than usual.
You've failed, haven't you?

34:34.322 --> 34:35.914
Well, no.

34:35.956 --> 34:40.826
We've had a temporary setback,
but at least we know who we're after.

34:40.862 --> 34:44.353
Well, we don't exactly know
who we're after, but...

34:44.399 --> 34:47.562
But the ki'i is gone, isn't it?
Probably for good.

34:47.601 --> 34:52.096
After all that talk about security,
not mixing business with pleasure...

34:52.139 --> 34:54.904
- You're not being fair.
- Damn right I'm not.

34:54.943 --> 35:00.074
Thanks to your brilliant performance,
the orphanage is out $50,000.

35:00.115 --> 35:02.743
That is a lot of lunches and a lot of beds.

35:02.784 --> 35:05.844
There is something else going on here.

35:05.887 --> 35:11.348
Two guys break into the estate and the only
thing they touch is the ki'i. Why?

35:13.595 --> 35:14.994
Catherine?

35:15.997 --> 35:18.557
Jonathan, I don't feel very well.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.091
Could I possibly have a glass of water?

35:21.136 --> 35:22.125
Of course.

35:22.170 --> 35:27.301
You said you bought the ki'i from
someone in LA. What was her name?

35:27.342 --> 35:29.970
Not now, Magnum.
Can't you see she's not well?

35:30.011 --> 35:32.536
- OK, I've got it.
- Got what?

35:32.581 --> 35:36.915
- Car was rented from the Blue Grotto Arms.
- Get T.C. Let's go.

35:47.562 --> 35:51.658
I've been pulling this cab all summer,
run ten miles a day on the beach.

35:51.700 --> 35:56.501
I'm in great shape. So how come
all I want to do right now is sleep?

35:56.538 --> 35:59.336
- That'll be 36.50.
- Thirty...?

36:01.843 --> 36:02.867
Great idea.

36:04.179 --> 36:06.044
Thank you.

36:06.081 --> 36:11.018
The sooner we put this thing in Harold's arms,
the sooner I can start to celebrate.

36:11.052 --> 36:15.113
I just wanna get out of here
and go home. I do not like it here.

36:19.828 --> 36:21.921
What's wrong with this?

36:21.963 --> 36:25.194
- It just stopped.
- I want to get off.

36:27.869 --> 36:29.530
Harold?

36:29.571 --> 36:30.560
Hey!

36:34.342 --> 36:35.809
Harold?

36:35.844 --> 36:37.471
We got it.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.474
We got it.

36:43.518 --> 36:46.009
- Here you go.
- Thank God.

36:47.722 --> 36:50.418
I must return it to the cave.

36:57.065 --> 36:58.623
Harold?

37:06.540 --> 37:09.100
- He's dead, A.J.
- Hi, guys.

37:22.016 --> 37:26.077
This probably doesn't look good,
but we can explain.

37:26.120 --> 37:29.385
- We're private investigators.
- Simon and Simon.

37:29.423 --> 37:31.983
You're not surfing exterminators?

37:32.026 --> 37:36.019
- Who's he?
- That's our client, Harold Sands.

37:36.998 --> 37:39.990
They're P. I.s, all right. California.

37:43.704 --> 37:47.140
- Can we put our hands down?
- Sure.

37:48.176 --> 37:49.507
No.

37:49.544 --> 37:51.535
I was just gonna cover up Harold.

37:51.579 --> 37:55.481
Don't you think we ought to leave the body
till the cops get here?

37:56.551 --> 38:00.544
Before we call them,
maybe you could just hit the high spots?

38:03.124 --> 38:04.523
OK.

38:05.526 --> 38:10.589
Harold Sand owns... owned
an antique store in Beverly Hills.

38:10.631 --> 38:16.228
A few months ago, a lady named
Alex Huston conned him out of that thing.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.771
- Conned?
- Conned.

38:18.806 --> 38:23.266
Yeah. She was young and pretty
and Harold... wasn't.

38:23.311 --> 38:27.270
- He hired us to get it back for him.
- Get it back or steal it back?

38:27.315 --> 38:30.409
We found out it had been
donated to an auction

38:30.451 --> 38:33.943
by a very rich lady from Los Angeles.

38:33.988 --> 38:37.321
I don't know how you hotshots operate
in California,

38:37.358 --> 38:39.918
but couldn't you just have explained?

38:39.961 --> 38:44.398
No. Harold didn't have time.
He thought he was dying from the curse.

38:44.432 --> 38:49.199
That's right. Curse of the Poison-god.
Oogaboogah!

38:49.237 --> 38:52.798
We didn't believe it either. Harold did.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.638
You're telling us this thing has a curse on it?

38:55.676 --> 38:58.770
Harold thought the only way
to get rid of the curse

38:58.813 --> 39:01.475
was to put it in a cave
on Molokai near Wali...

39:01.515 --> 39:03.506
- Wailea?
- Yeah.

39:03.551 --> 39:08.648
Harold thought that until we did that,
whoever had the thing... would have curse.

39:10.391 --> 39:14.157
That's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard.

39:22.470 --> 39:24.199
Trade winds.

39:27.475 --> 39:30.535
Even if I believed you guys, which I don't,

39:30.578 --> 39:32.876
you owe Higgins a lot of money.

39:32.913 --> 39:35.575
- Huh?
- Wait a minute. How do you figure that?

39:35.616 --> 39:38.141
Easy. This ki'i is worth big bucks.

39:38.185 --> 39:40.710
Uh, Thomas? Excuse me, fellas.

39:40.755 --> 39:43.690
That's the lady. That's Alex Huston.

39:44.392 --> 39:47.384
- That's Catherine Hailey.
- Alex Huston.

39:47.428 --> 39:51.455
I'm very grateful for your tireless efforts
on the children's behalf.

39:51.499 --> 39:55.936
I am just glad that the auction was
such a success. Would you mind?

39:57.471 --> 40:00.531
That is an awful lot of cash
to be carrying around.

40:00.574 --> 40:05.443
- Are you sure you don't want to come?
- You'll be fine. You have Dennis.

40:06.814 --> 40:08.338
Yes. Well...

40:09.283 --> 40:11.274
- Lunch tomorrow?
- Of course.

40:12.219 --> 40:15.211
Why don't you invite Magnum
to come along too?

40:15.256 --> 40:17.952
I suppose I was a little sharp with him.

40:17.992 --> 40:20.790
It's not really his fault
the ki'i was stolen.

40:21.862 --> 40:24.387
- Until tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

41:29.463 --> 41:30.794
Higgins!

41:32.233 --> 41:33.564
Higgins.

41:33.768 --> 41:35.099
Oh!

41:36.804 --> 41:41.104
What the bloody hell do you think
you're doing? This isn't Le Mans.

41:41.142 --> 41:44.373
Did you apprehend
the blackguards?

41:44.412 --> 41:47.870
You got them? Jolly good work. First rate.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.107
Where are they?

41:50.985 --> 41:53.545
- At the hotel with Rick and T.C.
- What?

41:53.587 --> 41:55.919
- What about the ki'i?
- It's with them.

41:55.956 --> 41:59.585
They're working for the guy who owned it,
but it was stolen.

41:59.627 --> 42:03.893
He had to get it back because he was dying
of this curse. Actually, he is dead...

42:03.931 --> 42:06.764
- Magnum.
- I'll explain later. Where's Catherine?

42:06.801 --> 42:10.168
Gone to the bank
with the proceeds from the auction.

42:10.204 --> 42:11.762
You sent her to the bank?

42:11.806 --> 42:14.331
- Yes.
- With money?

42:14.375 --> 42:17.208
With cashier's checks and $200,000.

42:17.244 --> 42:20.475
- Tell me what's going on.
- What time is it, Higgins?

42:21.849 --> 42:23.680
Exactly 4:14.

42:26.654 --> 42:30.351
- The bank closes at three.
- But the airport's open all night.

43:15.336 --> 43:17.964
<i>It was an uncomfortable ride
to the airport.</i>

43:18.005 --> 43:20.803
<i>It wasn't easy
telling Higgins he'd been had.</i>

43:20.841 --> 43:25.403
<i>He took it stoically,
but the look on his face told me plenty.</i>

43:26.413 --> 43:30.372
<i>Because not only did Catherine steal
$200,000 from him,</i>

43:30.417 --> 43:32.408
<i>she stole his pride too</i>.

43:33.287 --> 43:35.619
.. <i>to the airline's ticket office</i>.

43:41.328 --> 43:43.728
L.A. She said she was from L.A.

43:44.932 --> 43:48.561
There's a flight leaving
in five minutes. Gate 7B.

43:48.602 --> 43:54.199
<i>All passengers on flight 1 to Tokyo
report to concourse B, area A.</i>

43:56.844 --> 43:59.972
I say, Magnum, would you? Please?

44:03.250 --> 44:05.275
Hi, Dennis.

44:11.692 --> 44:15.093
<i>Departing flight 145
for San Francisco</i>

44:15.129 --> 44:19.065
<i>is now ready for boarding
on the upper level. Gate 27.</i>

44:22.870 --> 44:25.270
- Hold that plane.
- Sorry, she's taking off.

44:25.306 --> 44:30.039
You'll be more than sorry. You'll be responsible
for the death of my niece.

44:30.077 --> 44:35.037
Geraldine was so excited about her trip
that she forgot her heart medicine.

44:35.082 --> 44:39.382
Mimi, it's Roy. We've got a medical
emergency on board. Open up.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.565
Oh!

45:01.075 --> 45:02.565
Aargh!

45:18.425 --> 45:20.017
This way, Geraldine.

45:24.565 --> 45:27.295
- Well done, Magnum.
- Well done, yourself.

45:45.152 --> 45:46.483
Let's go.

45:46.520 --> 45:49.751
Good idea. Before the cops
change their mind.

45:49.790 --> 45:51.815
I can't wait to get back
on solid ground.

45:51.859 --> 45:53.952
- Like California?
- Yeah.

45:53.994 --> 45:57.361
Look, we're sorry if we
put you through any hassle.

45:57.398 --> 45:58.888
Oh.

45:58.932 --> 46:03.562
Look at it from our point of view -
everything we did made sense at the time.

46:04.638 --> 46:06.299
Aloha, guys.

46:07.775 --> 46:10.073
- See ya.
- Auf Wiedersehen.

46:10.110 --> 46:11.543
Take it easy.

46:13.914 --> 46:17.475
Hey, wait a minute. What about the ki'i?

46:17.518 --> 46:19.247
Cops took it.

46:25.159 --> 46:30.256
This is crazy!
I'm beginning to wonder about you.

46:30.297 --> 46:34.256
The coroner said the guy died
of a heart attack, not a curse.

46:34.301 --> 46:38.931
Higgins said it's worth about 50 grand.
He won't like you burying it in some cave.

46:38.972 --> 46:40.496
Come on, guys.

46:40.541 --> 46:45.342
Even the police said it would be better
if the ki'i went back to Wailea.

46:53.053 --> 46:55.044
Something wrong?

46:56.890 --> 46:58.414
No, it couldn't be.

46:58.459 --> 47:01.360
Just had an overhaul
week before last.

47:02.663 --> 47:04.858
The mixture must be too rich.

47:04.898 --> 47:06.229
Yeah, it must be.

47:21.482 --> 47:25.043
You are gonna keep that thing closed
the whole trip?

47:25.085 --> 47:26.882
Yes.
