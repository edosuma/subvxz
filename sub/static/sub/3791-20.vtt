60 million bucks,
just to have sex with her?

01:15.170 --> 01:17.775
Come on, Vince, you could've done it.
You've done worse.

01:18.402 --> 01:20.498
"Worse"?
He was ready to do it for free.

01:20.638 --> 01:22.564
You sound like
you think I should've done it.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.935
You should've at least
considered it, bro.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.780
I know I did when
I was similarly propositioned.

01:27.924 --> 01:29.922
Someone offered you money to fuck?

01:30.020 --> 01:31.070
Yeah, that's right, hater.

01:31.351 --> 01:33.330
"Viking quest" convention,'99.

01:33.645 --> 01:35.656
A guy from orlando
offered me 50 bucks

01:35.770 --> 01:38.859
to photograph me banging his wife
while I was wearing my Tarvold costume.

01:38.970 --> 01:40.461
Jesus christ, what did you say?

01:41.460 --> 01:43.450
I said no.
What the fuck you think I said?

01:44.632 --> 01:45.920
But I did let her blow me in the car

01:45.930 --> 01:47.440
When hubby??It ??The roul??Te table.*

01:49.050 --> 01:50.170
So what now?

01:51.160 --> 01:52.609
Sell blood like Robert Rodriguez?

01:52.883 --> 01:54.318
Nah, I'm not worried.

01:55.010 --> 01:56.088
Really?

01:56.605 --> 01:58.533
Maybe a little.
We'd better go.

02:04.659 --> 02:06.108
Feel free to grab one, Turtle.

02:06.823 --> 02:08.412
Why couldn't we pay
someone to do this?

02:08.560 --> 02:10.490
You could have.
We are trying to save money.

02:10.752 --> 02:12.796
Looks like it's time for everyone
to start thinking

02:12.870 --> 02:15.604
about their individual futures.
How sad.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.445
Aw, come on, stop your moping.

02:17.543 --> 02:19.386
We are all good.
Think about it.

02:19.441 --> 02:21.140
This place is gonna feel
like a jail cell

02:21.150 --> 02:22.604
compared to the digs at the Mondrian.

02:22.660 --> 02:25.333
I think E's house is the one
that's gonna feel like a jail cell.

02:25.490 --> 02:28.317
- Oh boy, here we go.
- And I think I speak for everyone--

02:28.635 --> 02:30.295
Don't know why
you don't go to the hotel.

02:30.309 --> 02:32.208
'Cause I've a girl friend
with a big apartment.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.332
Why waste money,
especially when I don't have any.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.909
Never move in with a girl
for financial reasons.

02:36.961 --> 02:40.078
Never never. 'Cause once you're in,
you never get out.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.820
I'don't. I'm just staying there
until we leave to shoot the movie.

02:42.855 --> 02:44.538
And that girl
from <I>Silence of the Lambs

02:44.623 --> 02:46.086
was just "staying" in that well.

02:51.428 --> 02:52.494
Hey. Guys.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.720
The house-- get over here.

02:58.420 --> 02:59.450
Say goodbye.

03:01.676 --> 03:03.270
Goodbye, house.

03:32.384 --> 03:33.509
That's the last of it.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.281
Sloan, he's all yours.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.358
And I promise to take
excellent care of him.

03:37.443 --> 03:39.426
He needs little snacks
in between meals.

03:39.525 --> 03:42.574
Otherwise his blood sugar drops
and he gets very cranky.

03:42.693 --> 03:45.070
No naps, otherwise
he can't sleep at night.

03:45.190 --> 03:47.799
Okay. Thank you for the tips.
Do you guys want a drink?

03:47.939 --> 03:50.036
No thank, we're gonna hit our café.

03:50.837 --> 03:52.430
So what are you two
lovebirds gonna do?

03:53.477 --> 03:55.784
I think E's gonna take me
for a special lunch,

03:55.897 --> 03:57.585
thank me for my hospitality.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.030
He didn't mention that.

04:03.615 --> 04:06.016
- Give me something good, Ari.
<I>- How about something great?

04:06.283 --> 04:08.182
Nicky Rubenstein turned 35 today.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.353
And why do I care?

04:09.390 --> 04:11.177
<I>You care because his trust fund

04:11.290 --> 04:14.210
kicks in and he wants to get out
from the shadow of his pops.

04:14.431 --> 04:17.583
He wants to meet on <I>Medellin
and he's bringing his checkbook.

04:17.870 --> 04:19.248
- Really?
- What?

04:19.399 --> 04:21.220
Nicky Rubenstein's
got the money for <I>Medellin.

04:23.414 --> 04:25.264
- Ari, is this for real?
- It is for real.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.550
The little prick is on his way
to the office right now.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.091
Why don't you boys come in for a talk?

04:29.700 --> 04:31.317
He wants us at his office now.
Let's go.

04:31.420 --> 04:32.583
- Right now?
- Now.

04:32.705 --> 04:35.322
- Go, baby, it's fine.
- You sure?

04:35.660 --> 04:37.870
Yeah, of course I am.
This is huge.

04:38.277 --> 04:40.823
Okay. I'll make it up to you tonight
at a nice dinner, okay?

04:45.096 --> 04:47.059
Did you see the look on Sloan's face

04:47.160 --> 04:49.606
when E had to cancel
their special lunch?

04:49.713 --> 04:52.832
It was like the look on mine when he
told us he was gonna be living with her.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.985
There was no look.
She couldn't have been cooler.

04:55.069 --> 04:57.866
- Sloan is not like other girls.
- All girls are like other girls, E.

04:57.956 --> 04:59.546
Just like all guys are like other guys.

04:59.617 --> 05:02.951
The world is split in two groups:
penises and pussies.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.787
Penises want to run free,
pussies want to land the penis.

05:05.899 --> 05:08.094
Amazing you guys have such
a hard time getting laid.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.194
Whatever. Go get your money.
Let's roll.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.409
Where to?

05:11.550 --> 05:13.393
If you guys
are really leaving for Colombia,

05:13.491 --> 05:15.953
This network-series star better
find himself a place to live.

05:16.038 --> 05:17.526
- Come on.
- You buying lunch?

05:18.330 --> 05:19.550
Yeah, sure, but no appies.

05:19.607 --> 05:21.295
E's not the only one
watching his budget.

05:21.351 --> 05:22.640
We'll see you guys later.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.263
See you.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.308
My father will not be
involved in this at all.

05:30.596 --> 05:31.848
<I>Medellin is my thing.

05:31.974 --> 05:33.423
My shot, my way.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.010
Fantastic.

05:36.819 --> 05:37.874
- What?
- What?

05:37.999 --> 05:40.138
I can sense that mocking
condescending tone in there.

05:40.236 --> 05:41.967
No no, nicky,
there is no mocking.

05:42.060 --> 05:43.798
I've known this guy since I was a kid

05:43.861 --> 05:45.915
And he still looks at me like
I'm a spoiled prick.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.113
Are you kidding? I look at you with awe
of all of your accomplishments.

05:49.254 --> 05:50.710
Right. You know what ?
I don't care.

05:50.763 --> 05:52.972
Truth is I got so much money now
I can sit on my ass

05:53.071 --> 05:55.350
and fuck models for the rest of my life
if I wanted to.

05:55.432 --> 05:57.833
- I'm not a model, I'm a singer.
- I'm just making a point.

05:57.889 --> 05:59.141
- Anyway?
- Anyway,

05:59.324 --> 06:01.491
The studio budgeted the film
at 65 million.

06:01.944 --> 06:02.998
You're gonna give us that?

06:03.083 --> 06:05.357
No, it's a studio budget.
That's ridiculous. I got 25.

06:05.442 --> 06:07.298
- 25's not enough, nicky.
- That's what I got.

06:07.354 --> 06:09.071
And you know what, nicky?
It's plenty.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.986
What do you know about
a movie budget?

06:11.060 --> 06:12.691
What do you know, mini-producer?

06:12.770 --> 06:15.906
I know that three studios budgeted it
And all of them were over 65 million.

06:15.991 --> 06:18.653
Even if they inflated it 20%
we're still not even close.

06:18.723 --> 06:20.270
You make concessions.

06:20.341 --> 06:22.564
Like what?
Shoot in malibu for colombia?

06:22.685 --> 06:24.219
They shot <I>King Kong in New Zealand

06:24.317 --> 06:26.582
and that monkey climbed up
the empire state building.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.955
If you want this thing,
you figure out a way to make it work.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.942
They always fight this much?

06:33.220 --> 06:36.066
Look, guys, this is what I got
and it's kind of non-negotiable.

06:36.257 --> 06:37.830
So if you think you can make it work,

06:38.114 --> 06:39.985
I'm in for letting you do
it how you want to.

06:40.044 --> 06:41.800
All right? So what do you think?

06:43.802 --> 06:45.222
I think this movie needs a director

06:45.307 --> 06:47.741
with a vision and a guy
that knows how to stretch a dollar.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.589
Walsh.

06:49.857 --> 06:51.450
You know a director named
Billy Walsh, nicky?

06:51.954 --> 06:53.642
Are you kidding?
"I am Queens Boulevard."

06:55.706 --> 06:57.366
This is just temporary housing

06:57.440 --> 06:59.400
until I find something
I really want to live in.

06:59.410 --> 07:02.203
No problem, we have
month-to-month Leases.

07:02.330 --> 07:03.530
Fantastic.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.410
You're on that show--

07:08.310 --> 07:09.473
<I>Five Towns, right?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.171
- Indeed I am.
- I knew it!

07:11.271 --> 07:13.044
- Are you a fan?
- My daughter is.

07:13.249 --> 07:16.358
She loves that young boy
who's always taking his shirt off.

07:16.541 --> 07:17.883
Mm, cutie.

07:18.402 --> 07:22.429
So doesn't the star of his own tv show
want something bigger?

07:23.030 --> 07:25.024
No, a loft is all I need.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.134
You should get a little
extra space, Drama.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.945
I'll get extra space when I know
if my show gets picked up.

07:30.139 --> 07:32.903
I'm not getting sucked into the trapping
of celebrity life again.

07:33.008 --> 07:34.137
I'm not doing it.

07:36.050 --> 07:37.430
Here we are.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.110
You gotta be kidding me.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.252
Quiet. It's perfect.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.675
- So what is he shooting?
- He didn't say.

07:47.046 --> 07:49.010
- Is he even available?
- He didn't say.

07:50.195 --> 07:52.630
Look, there's a camera truck.
This must be the place.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.753
Beautiful, beautiful...

08:01.440 --> 08:03.270
Okay, now push in.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.620
You ready for your pop shot, phillipe?

08:11.163 --> 08:12.246
I think I blew it.

08:13.570 --> 08:16.050
Again you blew it? You useless putz!

08:16.500 --> 08:17.770
Sorry, Wally.

08:18.284 --> 08:19.620
<I>Boogie nights II?

08:20.152 --> 08:22.346
There they are, the suit and the star.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.180
Hey, everybody, wake up.
A real actor just arrived on the set.

08:25.290 --> 08:27.139
You could all learn a thing
or two from him.

08:28.104 --> 08:29.427
What's up, billy?

08:30.680 --> 08:32.092
It's Wally around here.

08:32.809 --> 08:33.929
I'm breaking for lunch.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.041
Amuse yourselves.
Come on, vin, we'll go talk.

08:36.140 --> 08:36.990
Hey,Bbilly.

08:39.030 --> 08:41.150
They allow pets
if you wanted me to take Arnold.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.518
I would not subject Arnold
to that shithole.

08:43.722 --> 08:44.770
You'd rather board him?

08:44.780 --> 08:47.477
I'd rather put him out on the streets
and let him fend for himself.

08:47.533 --> 08:49.194
To each his own,
but he's always welcome.

08:49.236 --> 08:50.879
- You too, Turtle.
- Thanks.

08:54.387 --> 08:57.046
Hey, shauna, how is my lovely
publicist doing?

08:57.200 --> 09:00.097
I'm not your publicist till you write
a check, you cheap fuck.

09:00.130 --> 09:01.860
until then
I'm simply doing Vince a favor.

09:01.870 --> 09:04.982
Well, whatever it is you're doing,
I do appreciate it. So what's up?

09:05.090 --> 09:08.899
I'm trying to find out if you're
actually renting an $800 a month studio?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.506
- It's a loft. How'd you know?
- "Us weekly" just called.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.403
Apparently
your new landlord likes to talk.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.289
Sweet. Do they want to do
a photo shoot over there?

09:16.460 --> 09:19.452
No one's photographing anything.
I told them it wasn't true.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.439
- Why?
- Because vincent chase's brother

09:21.523 --> 09:23.379
cannot be living
like a transient crack whore,

09:23.436 --> 09:26.400
not while Vince doesn't have job.
You're on a network fucking show.

09:26.456 --> 09:28.859
Wake up, get a life
and get a place with two toilets,

09:28.971 --> 09:30.066
if not for you, for Vince.

09:30.122 --> 09:31.670
So this town doesn't get the impression

09:31.712 --> 09:34.028
that he sold his house
because he's broke, even if he is.

09:34.042 --> 09:36.656
- Will you do that for Vince, Drama?
- Yeah, of course I will.

09:36.764 --> 09:39.190
Great, there's an apartment
at 8812 Burton way

09:39.200 --> 09:41.520
I just looked at with a client.
It'd be perfect for you.

09:41.675 --> 09:43.902
- Great area, reasonably priced.
- What's reasonable?

09:44.043 --> 09:45.852
Goodbye.
Make sure she doesn't take a nap.

09:45.908 --> 09:47.554
I don't want to be up all fucking night.

09:48.801 --> 09:49.810
What's up?

09:49.871 --> 09:52.375
My budget. Take us to 9010.

09:56.890 --> 09:59.210
So the suit is producing a movie, huh?

09:59.295 --> 10:00.960
Actually, we're both producing it.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.460
What do you know
about producing a movie, suit?

10:03.512 --> 10:05.693
- I know a good script.
- Says who?

10:06.470 --> 10:07.946
I found <I>Queens Boulevard, didn't I?

10:08.073 --> 10:09.887
Ah, the luck of the Irish.

10:09.990 --> 10:11.950
Hey, come on, billy,
what do you say?

10:12.450 --> 10:13.465
You want to make a movie?

10:13.530 --> 10:15.541
I'm making movies, Vince, my way.

10:15.690 --> 10:17.926
Your way?
They're calling you "Wally" there.

10:18.668 --> 10:19.920
What's that all about?

10:21.210 --> 10:24.290
"Wally Balls"-- That's my alias.
It's catchy, ain't it?

10:24.410 --> 10:28.910
And they gave me a 25-picture deal
after seeing me shoot only one scene.

10:28.990 --> 10:32.561
Billy Walsh is gonna bring
the 1970s-type class

10:32.688 --> 10:35.488
back to porn. And the wide bush.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.949
We got a real movie here, billy.
You're gonna love it.

10:38.019 --> 10:39.039
It's right up your alley.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.692
Suit, you got no fucking idea
what my alley is.

10:41.837 --> 10:43.930
I never made movies for money
and I never made movies

10:44.029 --> 10:46.011
yo please anybody but myself,
and, Vince...

10:47.462 --> 10:49.254
as great as it was to make "Q. B."

10:49.360 --> 10:51.300
The pain of having
it ripped away from me

10:51.310 --> 10:53.730
and fucking butchered
was just too much to bear.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.210
I really appreciate
you coming down here

10:57.590 --> 10:58.640
but I'm sorry.

11:00.230 --> 11:02.114
Yeah, me too, billy. Me too.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.086
Suit, best of luck to you, all right?

11:05.260 --> 11:06.500
Yeah, you too, billy.

11:06.952 --> 11:08.669
I guess you don't need luck
though, right?

11:09.097 --> 11:11.249
It looks like you got everything
you need right here.

11:11.487 --> 11:14.765
Insult me, suit,
and I will bite off your fucking nose.

11:14.855 --> 11:17.134
You know what?
I've knocked out guys taller than you.

11:17.220 --> 11:18.432
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

11:18.516 --> 11:20.542
Hey, guys guys, come on.

11:20.777 --> 11:23.560
You're right, I don't know anything
about producing movie.

11:24.103 --> 11:27.029
But I do know this guy,
this script and you directing--

11:27.170 --> 11:28.830
even though you are a total douchebag--

11:28.990 --> 11:30.090
is a home run.

11:33.244 --> 11:36.972
Give me the script, suit.
I need an hour.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.808
Evette, get me a fluffer
in the greenroom.

11:40.710 --> 11:41.920
I got reading to do.

11:42.620 --> 11:43.670
Yeah, we'll be waiting.

11:44.690 --> 11:45.640
Really?

11:45.950 --> 11:47.205
Yeah, what else we got to do?

11:58.459 --> 11:59.725
Fucking Beverly Hills--

11:59.893 --> 12:01.271
Even the water's pricier here.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.710
I don't know,
it looks pretty nice to me,

12:04.025 --> 12:05.940
Especially compared
to that dump we just left.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.230
Don't be fooled by the exterior.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.503
This place will be half the size
and twice the price

12:09.643 --> 12:12.440
Just so you can tell people you got
the same zip as Shannen Doherty.

12:14.950 --> 12:16.357
We're here to see the two bedroom.

12:18.980 --> 12:19.700
Gentlemen.

12:23.050 --> 12:24.060
My god.

12:24.990 --> 12:26.690
Arnold could definitely stay here.

12:26.985 --> 12:30.200
Everything's been redone and restored
in the past nine months--

12:30.436 --> 12:34.136
Marble bathroom floors,
sunken tub, steam shower.

12:34.786 --> 12:36.052
Look at this view.

12:36.420 --> 12:37.510
Look at this kitchen!

12:37.631 --> 12:39.770
All viking. ?? It was put in

12:39.790 --> 12:42.070
When one of the contestants from
"the iron chef" stayed here.

12:42.510 --> 12:43.560
So what do you think?

12:44.840 --> 12:46.050
I think it's fantastic.

12:46.920 --> 12:47.959
I think it's home.

12:50.635 --> 12:52.168
But there are some problems.

12:52.792 --> 12:54.630
For one, if I had my druthers,

12:54.854 --> 12:56.922
I would face northeast,

12:57.080 --> 12:59.723
not southwest,
which this clearly does.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.454
And $2500 a Month,

13:02.539 --> 13:04.394
is not what I was planning on spending.

13:04.436 --> 13:06.070
What kind of wiggle room you got there?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.996
$2500 a month? No.

13:08.264 --> 13:10.965
This is a condo.
It's for sale at 1.4 million.

13:11.407 --> 13:12.770
1.4 million?

13:13.540 --> 13:15.243
Wait, is this 8812 Burton way?

13:15.640 --> 13:17.117
No, it's 8814.

13:21.306 --> 13:22.868
I never did two guys before.

13:23.574 --> 13:25.370
There's a first time
for everything, right?

13:25.589 --> 13:26.673
I guess.

13:27.020 --> 13:28.270
- Awesome.
- Yeah?

13:29.322 --> 13:30.630
- I bought it.
- Sweet.

13:30.693 --> 13:31.707
Want to run it again?

13:32.651 --> 13:35.598
- Pick any restaurant you want.
- <I>Wow, so accommodating.

13:35.700 --> 13:38.427
I'm felling good. I'm just praying
this maniac likes the script.

13:38.653 --> 13:40.693
All right,
I'll wear my good-luck manolos.

13:40.843 --> 13:41.898
How about Giorgio's?

13:42.070 --> 13:43.220
- Perfect.
- <I>8:00?

13:43.378 --> 13:44.391
Sounds Good.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.097
- Love You.
- <I>Love you too.

13:49.373 --> 13:50.414
Talk to me, what?

13:52.259 --> 13:54.974
Pablo fucking Escobar?

13:55.780 --> 13:57.382
I wanted to make a movie about this guy

13:57.439 --> 13:59.366
since the first time I read
a story about him

13:59.408 --> 14:02.080
blowing up that airliner.
I love Pablo Escobar.

14:02.090 --> 14:03.222
So you like the script?

14:04.160 --> 14:05.931
What, was I not just fucking clear?

14:06.184 --> 14:07.610
Can you do it for 25 million?

14:08.310 --> 14:09.370
I don't see why not.

14:09.730 --> 14:11.007
I need to talk to the financier.

14:11.220 --> 14:12.271
No problem.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.410
I love it, Vince. Thank you.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.490
We're gonna win you an Oscar.

14:17.651 --> 14:19.350
These halllways are too narrow

14:20.208 --> 14:21.784
- Stop complaining.
- And it's hot.

14:21.890 --> 14:24.154
They got no freakin'
air conditioner in this place?

14:24.230 --> 14:25.516
You're a misery.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.240
This is the unit right here.

14:27.980 --> 14:30.361
It's so spacious and lovely.

14:30.657 --> 14:31.830
I'm sure it is.

14:36.307 --> 14:37.418
It's not bad.

14:37.740 --> 14:40.446
Eat-in kitchen,
two bedrooms, two baths

14:40.713 --> 14:42.980
walking distance from
all the major shops.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.325
- What do you think?
- I hate it.

14:45.890 --> 14:48.670
Drama, come on,
this is a nice place in a nice area

14:48.734 --> 14:50.787
And it's not that expensive.
What's the problem?

14:51.087 --> 14:53.183
The problem is I want that condo.

14:54.389 --> 14:55.726
Will you calm down, nicky?

14:55.810 --> 14:57.280
Don't tell me to calm down, E.

14:57.941 --> 15:01.266
Your boy Walsh, he might be a genius,
but he's also an asshole.

15:01.678 --> 15:02.689
What's the problem?

15:02.720 --> 15:04.381
The problem is the guy wants more money.

15:05.424 --> 15:07.830
And he keeps calling me
"trust-Fund baby."

15:09.554 --> 15:11.418
Also, I can't say for sure,

15:11.460 --> 15:13.828
but I get the distinct feeling
the guy's trying to tell me

15:13.871 --> 15:15.151
that he fucked my girlfriend.

15:16.593 --> 15:18.436
He's calling
on the other line right now.

15:18.504 --> 15:20.183
I'm gonna take care him, don't worry.

15:20.261 --> 15:21.759
Get him in line.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.450
This financier of yours
is a bigger jerkoff than you are.

15:27.516 --> 15:29.190
What are you asking for more money for?

15:29.307 --> 15:31.685
What are you taking his side?
You're my producer.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.084
I'm not taking sides.

15:33.150 --> 15:34.250
Fuck you, suit.

15:35.870 --> 15:36.920
I love producing.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.619
The place Shauna sent me
is a complete shithole.

15:40.990 --> 15:42.485
It's only temporary, right, Johnny?

15:42.781 --> 15:45.482
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
I should live like an animal, bro.

15:45.777 --> 15:47.850
I thought you were getting
a nicer place for Vince.

15:48.237 --> 15:49.700
That was until I saw the kitchen.

15:50.690 --> 15:51.714
Now it's for me.??

15:51.760 --> 15:53.884
So do it. Say "fuck it."
I always do.

15:53.945 --> 15:55.464
What if my show doesn't get picked up?

15:55.534 --> 15:58.354
It premiered to 16 million viewers.
It's getting picked up.

15:58.450 --> 16:01.105
And if it don't, you've been kicked
out of a condo before.

16:01.355 --> 16:02.980
It's got to be easier the second time.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.561
You really think I should do it?

16:06.213 --> 16:08.591
If it makes you happy,
make them a modest offer.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.840
If they accept it, great.
If not, move on.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.025
I'm going to lowball
the shit out of them.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.400
I have dinner plans already.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.026
No, what you have
is a very nervous moneyman.

16:19.068 --> 16:21.229
I told him I'd handle this,
so why is he calling you?

16:21.299 --> 16:24.190
He's calling me because he sort
of sees me as a second father

16:24.382 --> 16:27.828
And he sort of sees you as a guy
who has no idea how to produce.

16:28.179 --> 16:29.783
<I>Now, I suggest

16:30.170 --> 16:33.539
you produce yourself at dinner
to calm everyone down.

16:33.661 --> 16:34.899
Will I see you at dinner?

16:35.008 --> 16:37.386
Yes, and thank you
for the fatherly advice as always.

16:37.724 --> 16:39.975
We got to have dinner with Walsh
and Rubenstein tonight.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.152
Disaster.

16:41.350 --> 16:42.740
It's not a disaster, it'll be fine.

16:42.817 --> 16:45.870
I meant a disaster that you got
to cancel another meal on Sloan.

16:46.346 --> 16:49.201
- Yeah, jesus, you're in deep shit.
- What is wrong with you guys?

16:49.280 --> 16:51.600
?? I've stayed at Sloan's
100 times over the past two years.

16:51.620 --> 16:54.130
What exactly do you
think has changed?

16:54.150 --> 16:57.580
The boxes, E. You brought over boxes.

16:57.590 --> 16:59.170
You planted a flag.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.850
Canceling a meal is going to be

17:00.870 --> 17:02.370
?? A whole lot different
after a planting.

17:04.670 --> 17:05.849
Are you sure
you're not mad?

17:05.869 --> 17:07.790
Why do you keep asking me that?

17:07.810 --> 17:10.950
?? 'S not that big of a deal.
We'll have dinner tomorrow night, right?

17:10.960 --> 17:13.150
Of course. Anywhere you want,
I promise.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.900
Don't promise, E.

17:16.420 --> 17:17.339
Huh?

17:17.740 --> 17:19.930
Oh, I just mean you don't know
what might happen tomorrow.

17:20.760 --> 17:21.640
?? So you are mad.??

17:21.660 --> 17:25.150
I'm not mad. I ?? Being
funny-- I thought.

17:25.630 --> 17:27.000
Can I put this in the other room?

17:27.010 --> 17:27.700
Sure.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.650
And I am not hanging that.

17:29.660 --> 17:30.800
What, you don't li?? This?

17:30.820 --> 17:32.290
This will look great above the tv.

17:34.550 --> 17:36.420
What the hell are we doing???

17:36.990 --> 17:37.770
About wh???

17:38.180 --> 17:39.290
About us.

17:40.220 --> 17:41.390
- About us?
- Yeah.

17:44.060 --> 17:45.030
Wow.

17:45.730 --> 17:46.910
"Wow" what?

17:47.770 --> 17:49.280
The guys said you were
gonna give me a hard time

17:49.300 --> 17:50.410
About staying here.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.060
Oh, so now I'm that girl.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.300
I don't know, are you?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.010
All right, you know what?
I'm not gonna fight with you.

17:59.420 --> 18:02.450
You've had a stressful day with
the movie stuff and the move

18:02.460 --> 18:04.870
So let's just talk t??Orrow.

18:04.890 --> 18:07.600
Oh??I'm sorry. ??U're upset--
I ??Nt to talk now.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.040
Okay.

18:11.940 --> 18:13.060
What is your p??N?

18:13.560 --> 18:16.240
If you go and shoot
this movie for six months,

18:16.250 --> 18:19.710
I want to know what me and all
these bo??S are waiting for.

18:20.510 --> 18:21.660
- Can I be honest?
- Yeah.

18:22.170 --> 18:24.100
I've been so caught up ??Trying
to put this movie together

18:25.420 --> 18:26.700
I haven't really thought abou??It.

18:27.370 --> 18:29.390
Okay, I understand. Can I be honest?

18:29.410 --> 18:30.160
?? Yeah.

18:31.090 --> 18:32.200
You really need to.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.730
So you like the place?

18:41.020 --> 18:42.850
I like it. I don't love it.

18:42.870 --> 18:46.430
?? He doesn't love it.????????

18:47.580 --> 18:50.680
Again, I like it. I don't love it.

18:50.700 --> 18:51.640
He doesn't love it.??

18:51.860 --> 18:53.390
You boys are trying to haggle, yes?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.420
- Yes.
- No.

18:54.430 --> 18:55.250
No.

18:55.270 --> 18:58.240
I don't haggle.
The price is $1.4 million.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.620
Well, this being a buyer's market,

19:02.410 --> 19:04.930
My offer is 950,000

19:05.570 --> 19:06.650
And that's final.

19:06.660 --> 19:07.870
1.4 million.

19:08.820 --> 19:09.780
1.1.

19:09.790 --> 19:10.770
1.4.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.760
Sir, I woke up this mo??Ing

19:13.780 --> 19:17.070
With a budget mapped out in
my head of $1,000 a month.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.020
Obviously I ??Ve stepped
up considerably

19:19.910 --> 19:22.650
But there are limits,
and we have reached mine.

19:23.290 --> 19:24.240
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:24.870 --> 19:26.280
All right, let's roll.

19:26.850 --> 19:27.770
1.2.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.970
- There is no negotiating.
- 1.3.

19:29.980 --> 19:31.070
Drama!

19:32.090 --> 19:33.500
Excuse me one moment.??

19:34.300 --> 19:35.050
Yeah?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.430
You're the worst negotiator
I've ever seen.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.950
I'm just working him in, Turtle.

19:40.450 --> 19:41.920
You figured out your finces.

19:41.940 --> 19:44.810
You came up with 1.1,
which is already a huge stretch.

19:44.990 --> 19:46.620
Now you're offering 1.3?

19:47.190 --> 19:50.070
Yo??Re not wor??Ng anybody.
Come on, g?? It under cont??L.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.370
- You're right, you're right.
- Here??E comes.

19:52.390 --> 19:54.810
I'm afraid that was another
offer at full listing.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.160
He's bluffing.??

19:56.430 --> 19:57.450
Am I?

19:59.920 --> 20:01.980
Thank you,??Ir,
I appreciate your time.

20:02.750 --> 20:03.790
I do yours as well.

20:05.050 --> 20:06.100
1.5!

20:06.110 --> 20:07.050
Done.??

20:07.820 --> 20:10.440
Fuck it. 16 million
viewers our first week?

20:10.460 --> 20:11.930
We're gonna be the next "seinld."

20:12.400 --> 20:13.310
Where do I sign?

20:13.330 --> 20:14.480
I got you set up right here.

20:14.490 --> 20:17.720
I need 30-- I can't do it
for a dollar less than that.

20:17.740 --> 20:19.470
I don't have any more money
for you, big guy.

20:19.490 --> 20:22.100
Oh, come on, you probably got
the cash out in your car,

20:22.120 --> 20:24.400
Trust-Fund baby.
Now just pony it up.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.890
Stop calling me
trust-Fund baby,

20:25.900 --> 20:27.540
You fucking oran??Tan!

20:27.550 --> 20:29.940
- Guys, this is getting us nowhere.
- We got a budget here.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.410
Hey, senior and junior suits, let the
creative people talk to the money people.

20:33.420 --> 20:35.350
My line producer has
done a budget

20:35.360 --> 20:38.990
And it's a budget that nobody
else on the planet fucking earth

20:39.010 --> 20:41.850
Could do to make this movie,
but it is the bare minimum.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.820
You understand that?
It cannot be done for less.

20:43.830 --> 20:46.105
Who is your line producer?
Where is this budget?

20:46.140 --> 20:48.380
I'm my fucking line producer,
trust-Fund baby.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.810
- And it's right here.
- Your own stationery?

20:51.820 --> 20:53.880
Now I'm gonna go dump--
You let me know.

20:55.890 --> 20:58.810
But let me say this: making
a movie is like??Going to

20:59.310 --> 21:01.470
And as we've all learned,
you don't go to war??

21:01.490 --> 21:03.940
Underprepared and underfinanced.

21:06.960 --> 21:10.780
Oh, and I want final cut
and that's not negotiable.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.760
- Forget this. No no, it's my fucking money. Forget it!
- Will you calm down?

21:14.770 --> 21:16.180
- Ari!
- What do you want me to do?

21:16.200 --> 21:18.060
- Get rid of this guy.
- We're not getting rid of him.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.850
- Vince, the guy??Is a loose cannon.
- He is our guy, nicky.

21:20.860 --> 21:22.740
Nicky, we've worked
with him, all righ??

21:22.750 --> 21:25.370
I hate him as much as you do,
but this guy is magic on the set.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.280
He is going to make a brilliant
movie, I know it.??

21:28.040 --> 21:30.080
And it's gonna be your brilliant movie,
not your father's.

21:30.090 --> 21:31.070
Yeah.

21:36.250 --> 21:37.360
Oh, fuck it.

21:37.930 --> 21:38.820
Fine.

21:39.870 --> 21:40.990
What's $5 million?

21:41.390 --> 21:42.240
Right?

21:43.270 --> 21:44.770
That is a lot of fucking zeroes.

21:46.030 --> 21:50.510
- I'm gonna need this...
- All right.

21:51.740 --> 21:53.050
...you'll need this. Have fun.

21:58.430 --> 22:00.840
- Did he sign it?
- Yeah.

22:02.460 --> 22:03.500
30 million.

22:04.330 --> 22:05.139
Made out to cash?

22:05.140 --> 22:06.290
Give me that??Heck, Ari.

22:08.070 --> 22:11.110
- Did this just fucking happen?
- It just-- It fucking happened.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.010
Sake bombs.

22:12.020 --> 22:12.940
Sake bombs.

22:14.380 --> 22:15.920
Bogota, baby.

22:19.340 --> 22:20.160
What?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.100
I can't believe you pulled this off.

22:22.110 --> 22:23.060
We pulled it off.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.410
Come on. You found the script,
you picked the direc??R,

22:26.940 --> 22:28.420
You convinced the financiers.

22:28.820 --> 22:29.900
So you think I ??N produce?

22:29.910 --> 22:33.590
I think you just did. And, E, I think
you don't have to go to colombia

22:33.600 --> 22:35.590
???? - If you don't want to.
- What are you talking??Bout?

22:35.610 --> 22:39.040
If you want to stay back with Sloan,
stay and find the next p??Ject.

22:39.090 --> 22:41.000
This is the one we've been waiting for,
the one that's gonna

22:41.035 --> 22:42.140
Set us up fo??The rest of our lives.

22:42.150 --> 22:44.860
?? - I want to see ?? Through to the end.
- And Sloan?

22:45.190 --> 22:47.870
- She's gonna have to wait.
- What if she doesn't?

22:52.050 --> 22:53.540
Hey, girls, we're home.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.620
Your bro??Er's a mess.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.170
What's your problem?

22:57.190 --> 22:59.570

22:59.580 --> 23:04.130

I'm back out on the streets.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.150
Come here. Come on, come out here.

23:08.790 --> 23:10.360
Look out at those lights.

23:10.380 --> 23:11.520
This is our city.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.560
Come on, it's all gonna work out.

23:13.580 --> 23:15.410
The universe always had a plan.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.840
I do??T believe in any of
that cosmic karmic bullshit,

23:20.220 --> 23:21.370
So what if it doesn't?

23:21.940 --> 23:23.700
If it doesn't, you can always
move back in with Vince.

23:24.340 --> 23:26.010
Please, baby brother's
broker than me.

23:27.650 --> 23:29.000

"Baby brother's broker than me.

23:30.830 --> 23:32.890

24:13.990 --> 24:17.620
Oh well, good thing I don't give
a fuck what you or anyone else thinks.
