38:41.275 --> 38:43.625
You were looking for me.
- I was.

38:43.669 --> 38:46.062
Kidd told me you helped her
with Girls On Fire,

38:46.106 --> 38:49.370
and I was hoping you could
maybe do the same for me.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.894
I have a project that
I wanna present to the brass.

38:57.073 --> 38:59.249

approval first.

38:59.293 --> 39:01.077
- Uh, well, um--

39:01.121 --> 39:03.906
as I'm not
your battalion chief anymore,

39:03.950 --> 39:05.908
chain of command has changed.

39:05.952 --> 39:08.215
I'm not allowed to sign off
on things like that now,

39:08.258 --> 39:11.697
so you have to go through
your new supervisor.

39:11.740 --> 39:14.830
- You--you mean at 51?
Let Casey do it?

39:14.874 --> 39:18.747
- No, it can't be a captain.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.749
You're gonna have to
go through your chief.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.756

Paramedic Chief Hawkins?

39:27.800 --> 39:28.975
The same guy who just told me

39:29.018 --> 39:30.411
he hopes he never
sees me again?

39:30.455 --> 39:31.847
- That's the one.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.724
- Uh, heads up, Captain.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.943
There's another teenager
out there looking for you.

39:40.987 --> 39:42.205
- Another one?

39:42.249 --> 39:44.120
I thought internet fame
was fleeting.

39:44.164 --> 39:46.558
- I could distract them for you
while you slip out the back.

39:46.601 --> 39:50.213
- Eh, it won't kill me
to take one more selfie.

39:50.257 --> 39:51.476
- All right.

39:58.483 --> 40:01.311

He was a good friend of mine.

40:06.229 --> 40:08.580

in the line of duty.

but I already saw you
all over Reddit.

40:23.856 --> 40:25.510
That was some save.

40:33.909 --> 40:36.825
- [laughs]
Look at you.

40:36.869 --> 40:37.957
- It's been a while, huh?

40:38.000 --> 40:41.308
- What is it?
Seven, eight years?

40:41.351 --> 40:43.876

40:43.919 --> 40:47.140
Feels like a lifetime, bud.
