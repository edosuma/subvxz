WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:07.097
Captain's Log, Stardate 49655.2.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.539
Our sensors have located
a variety of flower

00:09.609 --> 00:12.703
which may prove to be a valuable
nutritional supplement.

00:12.779 --> 00:16.236
l've sent Mr. Neelix and
Mr. Tuvok to collect samples.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.280
Whoa!

00:19.352 --> 00:21.377
Smell that air, Mr. Vulcan!

00:21.454 --> 00:24.150
Look at that sky!

00:24.224 --> 00:27.159
Oh, it's an exhilarating day,
isn't it?

00:27.227 --> 00:29.855
As you well know by now,
Mr. Neelix,

00:29.929 --> 00:31.863
l do not experience
exhilaration.

00:31.931 --> 00:35.367
Oh, let's not quibble
about semantics.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.995
A breeze is blowing,
the sun is shining.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.005
lt's beautiful.

00:40.073 --> 00:43.008
The weather is certainly
adequate for our purposes.

00:43.109 --> 00:45.339
Adequate?

00:45.412 --> 00:47.380
You know something?

00:47.447 --> 00:49.244
You're acting

00:49.315 --> 00:51.749
more ''Tuvokian''
than usual this morning.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.752
l am who l am, Mr. Neelix.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.254
lt is impossible for me to be
more or less like myself.

00:56.322 --> 00:59.450
There you go
with the semantics again.

00:59.526 --> 01:01.960
But you know
what l'm talking about.

01:02.028 --> 01:04.394
l'm afraid l don't.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.694
Well, then,
l'll explain it to you.

01:06.766 --> 01:09.735
You're a nature lover,
aren't you?

01:09.803 --> 01:11.737
l appreciate nature, yes.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.638
lt's one of the things that
you and l have in common.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.299
And here we are,
on a perfect day,

01:16.376 --> 01:19.311
foraging for an exceptionally
lovely variety of orchid--

01:19.379 --> 01:21.813
your favorite flower--
and all you can say

01:21.881 --> 01:24.975
about the experience
is that it's adequate.

01:25.051 --> 01:28.145
l just... l don't see
why you're not having fun.

01:28.221 --> 01:29.848
We are not here to have fun.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.982
We are here to collect samples.

01:32.058 --> 01:33.719
Why?
ls there some regulation

01:33.793 --> 01:36.523
that says we can't
do both at the same time?

01:36.596 --> 01:37.858
l know.

01:37.931 --> 01:41.628
Why don't, why don't we sing
a song while we toil, hmm?

01:41.701 --> 01:43.362
lt'll cheer you up.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.926
l've been studying Vulcan music.

01:45.004 --> 01:48.804
Uh... do you know
that lovely tune that starts:

01:48.875 --> 01:52.777
O starless night

01:52.846 --> 01:55.041
Of boundless black...

01:55.115 --> 01:58.983
That ''lovely tune''
is a traditional funeral dirge.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.917
l know,

02:00.987 --> 02:04.286
but it was the most cheerful
song l could find

02:04.357 --> 02:05.824
in the Vulcan database.

02:05.892 --> 02:08.053
Come on, Tuvok, join me.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.358
O starless night

02:10.430 --> 02:12.728
Of boundless black...

02:15.135 --> 02:16.193
Mr. Neelix...

02:16.269 --> 02:17.896
Yes?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.404
Do you think
you could possibly behave

02:19.472 --> 02:21.633
a little less...
like yourself?

02:26.513 --> 02:28.174
Are Neelix and Tuvok
back from the surface?

02:28.248 --> 02:30.478
Not yet. We're having some
trouble with the transporter.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.710
Captain...

02:31.784 --> 02:33.877
there's a minor glitch in the
molecular imaging scanners.

02:33.953 --> 02:37.821
Ensign Kim should have it up
and running in a few minutes.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.160
Try narrowing
the annular confinement beam.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.665
How's that?

02:47.734 --> 02:49.326
Let's try it again.

02:49.402 --> 02:50.994
Kim to away team.

02:51.070 --> 02:52.628
Sorry for the delay.

02:52.705 --> 02:53.694
We're ready to bring you back.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.240
Acknowledged.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.939
Energize.

03:02.248 --> 03:04.409
There's something wrong, sir.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.475
l'm only getting one pattern.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.544
Tuvok or Neelix?

03:08.621 --> 03:10.486
l don't think
it's either of them.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.548
Abort.

03:12.625 --> 03:13.956
lt's too late.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:13.646 --> 05:14.908
Kim to Security.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.414
lntruder alert,
Transporter Room 1.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.916
ldentify yourself.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.680
l'm Lieutenant Tuvok.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.448
And l'm Neelix.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.925
Sir, according to the
bio-scanners, he's right.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.622
Somehow their patterns
have merged.

05:35.535 --> 05:39.471
l think the logical thing
is for me to go to Sick Bay.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.403
And you recognize all of us?

05:47.480 --> 05:48.412
Of course.

05:48.481 --> 05:53.077
Doctor, Captain Janeway,
Ensign Kim...

05:53.152 --> 05:55.712
Kes.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.346
My scans indicate

05:57.423 --> 06:01.860
that all biological matter
was merged on a molecular level.

06:01.928 --> 06:05.694
Proteins, enzymes,
DNA sequences.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.096
The man you see before you

06:07.166 --> 06:08.861
is literally
a fusion of two men.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.060
But he's surprisingly healthy,
considering the circumstances.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.798
All vital signs are stable.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.601
What's the last thing
you remember?

06:14.674 --> 06:20.078
l... we... that is to say,
Tuvok and Neelix,

06:20.146 --> 06:22.341
we had just finished
gathering the samples.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.781
We were beaming back
to the ship.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.182
The next thing l knew,

06:26.252 --> 06:28.516
l was standing
on the transporter pad

06:28.588 --> 06:29.680
as you see me now.

06:29.756 --> 06:33.248
l'm also picking up traces
of a third genetic pattern.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.793
lt appears to be plant-based.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.726
The orchids.

06:36.796 --> 06:40.857
We had collected several dozen
samples of orchids.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.424
They were in our sample
containers when we beamed up.

06:43.503 --> 06:47.030
Well, they're part
of your genetic structure now.

06:47.106 --> 06:49.597
But they don't appear to be
affecting your biochemistry.

06:49.675 --> 06:50.937
Torres said you were
having trouble

06:51.010 --> 06:52.944
with the molecular imaging
scanners.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.070
That's right.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.081
Maybe this alien plant life

06:56.149 --> 06:58.640
affected
the scanners in some way.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.448
Possibly. l'll know more
after we've run a diagnostic

07:01.521 --> 07:03.785
on the biofilters
and transporter logs.

07:03.856 --> 07:04.845
Get on it.

07:07.527 --> 07:11.190
ln the meantime, l'll send
an away team in a shuttlecraft

07:11.264 --> 07:14.859
to collect fresh samples
of the orchid for further study.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.665
Doctor, let me know as soon
as you have something more.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.865
Yes, Captain.

07:24.677 --> 07:27.237
Kes, take our patient
to the Science Lab

07:27.313 --> 07:29.873
and perform a full
bio-spectral analysis.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.315
l'll start examining
the genetic data.

07:57.076 --> 07:59.909
This situation must be
very difficult for you, Kes.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.844
Perhaps it would be easier

08:01.948 --> 08:03.882
if someone else
administered these tests.

08:03.916 --> 08:08.319
Thank you for your concern,
but l'll be fine.

08:08.387 --> 08:09.547
This scan is very delicate,

08:09.622 --> 08:11.852
so try to remain still
for the next 20 minutes.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.721
l'll do my best.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.852
Don't worry.
We're going to figure it out.

08:15.928 --> 08:17.862
Oh, l'm not worried.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.864
l couldn't be in better hands.

08:19.932 --> 08:22.526
This crew, you're
consummate professionals.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.069
You're my friends.

08:24.136 --> 08:26.263
My family.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.503
So worrying would be illogical,
don't you think?

08:30.576 --> 08:33.510
Would you mind if l asked you
some questions

08:33.578 --> 08:35.171
about what you're going through?

08:35.248 --> 08:36.510
Not at all.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.176
Well, do you feel
as if you're thinking

08:39.251 --> 08:40.514
with two minds--

08:40.586 --> 08:42.178
two separate minds?

08:42.255 --> 08:45.782
Are Neelix and Tuvok
inside of you, talking to me,

08:45.858 --> 08:47.826
talking to each other?

08:47.894 --> 08:50.920
lf you mean am l suffering
from some form

08:50.997 --> 08:53.591
of multiple personality
disorder, l don't think so.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.635
l do have the memories
of both men,

08:56.702 --> 08:58.932
but l seem to have
a single consciousness.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.771
You must find me very odd, Kes.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.811
No, of course not.
Try to keep still.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.010
So... what should l call you?

09:11.083 --> 09:13.017
Ah, a name.

09:13.085 --> 09:14.848
l hadn't thought of that.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.855
What an intriguing question.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.686
l can see why the Doctor

09:18.758 --> 09:21.522
is finding it
so difficult to choose one.

09:21.594 --> 09:24.188
A name can have
a significant effect

09:24.263 --> 09:26.731
upon a person's
sense of identity.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.860
l've got it.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.267
What?

09:32.939 --> 09:34.907
Why don't you call me...

09:34.974 --> 09:36.373
Neevok.

09:37.376 --> 09:38.866
Wait.

09:40.813 --> 09:43.782
This is better.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.908
How about Tuvix?

09:45.985 --> 09:48.146
Tuvix it is.

09:48.220 --> 09:52.554
l'm so glad you're here to help
me through this, sweeting.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.028
l'm sorry.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.427
lt was instinct.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.929
Why don't we finish the scan.

10:12.244 --> 10:14.644
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
supplemental.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.308
Extensive microcellular scans
on the merged humanoid

10:17.383 --> 10:19.681
have, thus far, yielded
no clues to either a cause

10:19.752 --> 10:22.550
or a method of separation.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.886
Ah, Captain, so good
of you to come.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.219
How are you feeling?

10:26.292 --> 10:27.520
l feel well.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.993
You might even say...

10:30.062 --> 10:31.461
exhilarated.

10:31.530 --> 10:32.861
l'm glad to hear it.

10:32.932 --> 10:35.127
Well, that's what l wanted
to talk to you about.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.293
ln the past 24 hours,

10:36.369 --> 10:38.564
l've undergone
rigorous diagnostic testing,

10:38.638 --> 10:39.935
submitted to an extensive

10:40.006 --> 10:41.473
psychological profile

10:41.540 --> 10:43.599
and l've been poked and prodded

10:43.676 --> 10:46.509
in organs that l
didn't even know l had.

10:46.579 --> 10:51.778
While all this testing
may no doubt be necessary...

10:51.851 --> 10:53.716
frankly, l'm restless.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.219
To tell you the truth,

10:55.287 --> 10:58.154
we could use a little help
in the Mess Hall.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.317
And l'd be glad
to give you a hand.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.258
But...

11:02.328 --> 11:03.818
after careful consideration,

11:03.896 --> 11:07.127
l've decided that the most
sensible thing for me to do

11:07.199 --> 11:09.030
is to resume the tactical post.

11:09.101 --> 11:10.068
Tactical?

11:10.136 --> 11:11.933
Remember, Captain,

11:12.004 --> 11:14.495
l do possess Tuvok's
knowledge and expertise,

11:14.573 --> 11:16.165
and while l have no doubt

11:16.242 --> 11:19.973
that the crew misses
Neelix's cooking,

11:20.046 --> 11:23.538
you need your most
experienced Tactical Officer.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.550
That's me.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.144
lf l may, Captain.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.152
Mr. Tuvix...

11:29.221 --> 11:30.381
Tuvix?

11:30.456 --> 11:32.890
Apparently, that's what
he likes to be called.

11:32.958 --> 11:35.893
Mr. Tuvix is, indeed,
in perfect health.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.826
And since l've collected
all the data l need,

11:37.897 --> 11:39.660
there's no reason l can't
continue my investigation

11:39.732 --> 11:41.529
without him for the time being.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.329
And, according to my tests,
he's quite correct

11:43.402 --> 11:46.428
when he says that he possesses
Tuvok's knowledge and expertise.

11:46.505 --> 11:47.972
He also possesses

11:48.040 --> 11:50.474
Tuvok's irritating sense
of intellectual superiority

11:50.543 --> 11:54.946
and Neelix's
annoying ebullience.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.709
l would be very grateful to you

11:56.782 --> 11:58.773
if you would assign him
some duty.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.077
Any duty...

12:02.154 --> 12:04.987
somewhere else.

12:07.026 --> 12:10.621
Well... Mr. Tuvix...

12:10.696 --> 12:13.494
l'm not ready to assign you
to the Bridge just yet,

12:13.566 --> 12:15.761
but why don't you
join the senior staff

12:15.835 --> 12:16.927
for our noon briefing,

12:17.069 --> 12:19.162
and we'll see
how it goes from there.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.230
Captain, has anyone
ever told you

12:22.308 --> 12:25.835
that you are as fair-minded
as you are lovely?

12:25.911 --> 12:27.572
As a matter of fact,

12:27.646 --> 12:30.706
Neelix has told me that
occasionally.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.980
And if you really do
possess his memories...

12:34.086 --> 12:37.954
you'd know that flattery
will get you nowhere.

12:40.659 --> 12:42.854
The transporter
was functioning normally.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.692
Biofilters, pattern buffers,
everything checked out.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.993
What about the problem

12:47.066 --> 12:49.000
with the molecular
imaging scanners?

12:49.068 --> 12:50.501
According
to the transporter logs,

12:50.569 --> 12:52.469
they were optimal
at the time of transport.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.006
lt was a perfectly routine
beam-out sequence.

12:55.107 --> 12:59.009
No anomalies, no power
overloads, no malfunctions.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.875
Our scans of the planet's
surface and atmosphere

13:00.946 --> 13:03.176
don't show anything
out of the ordinary.

13:03.249 --> 13:06.343
There's no evidence of any type
of alien interference.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.249
Frankly, Captain,
we're at a loss.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.912
And the orchids, Kes?

13:10.022 --> 13:12.456
Have you found anything
unusual about them?

13:12.525 --> 13:15.392
Commander Chakotay brought back
a few samples on the shuttle

13:15.461 --> 13:17.224
and l ran
a biochemical analysis.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.527
They contain the same elements
as many plants: chloroplasts,

13:20.699 --> 13:23.190
lysosomal enzymes,
cytoplasmic proteins,

13:23.269 --> 13:25.203
but there's nothing unusual.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.171
There's never been an accident
like this recorded

13:27.239 --> 13:29.264
in the entire history
of transporter technology.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.139
l'm not willing to accept it
as a random malfunction.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.645
Captain, l recommend we program
a holodeck simulation,

13:34.713 --> 13:36.271
try recreating the accident.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.316
Sex.

13:39.585 --> 13:40.916
l beg your pardon?

13:40.986 --> 13:42.715
What l mean to say is--

13:42.788 --> 13:45.814
and l apologize
for cutting you off, Commander--

13:45.891 --> 13:48.086
l think
we're on the wrong track.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.494
Kes... you said that the flowers
you examined

13:52.565 --> 13:54.328
contained lysosomal enzymes.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.424
That's right.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.833
According to Tuvok's
botanical research,

13:57.903 --> 13:59.871
the presence
of lysosomal enzymes

13:59.939 --> 14:03.136
could be evidence
of symbiogenesis.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.675
Symbiogenesis?

14:04.710 --> 14:08.612
Symbiogenesis is a rare
reproductive process.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.478
lnstead of pollination
or mating,

14:10.549 --> 14:13.746
symbiogenetic organisms merge
with a second species.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.650
Andorian amoebae, for instance--

14:15.721 --> 14:19.817
they're able to merge with
other single-celled organisms

14:19.892 --> 14:21.917
to form a third unique species.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.392
A hybrid.

14:23.462 --> 14:24.690
Like you.

14:24.763 --> 14:27.027
Exactly.

14:27.099 --> 14:28.464
lt's an interesting idea,

14:28.534 --> 14:31.264
but we're talking about
microcellular organisms here.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.532
l've never heard
of symbiogenesis occurring

14:33.606 --> 14:35.597
in a species as complex
as a humanoid.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.972
Actually, Captain,
when you think about it,

14:38.077 --> 14:39.942
Neelix and Tuvok
were broken down

14:40.012 --> 14:43.743
to a microcellular level
during transport-- DNA,

14:43.816 --> 14:47.684
protein, all in a state
of molecular flux.

14:47.753 --> 14:51.712
And if the enzymes
that cause symbiogenesis

14:51.790 --> 14:53.257
interacted with their DNA

14:53.325 --> 14:54.519
while they were
in the matter stream,

14:54.593 --> 14:57.187
it might've caused
their patterns to merge.

14:57.263 --> 14:58.992
Like an Andorian amoeba.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.431
Just like that, Tuvix is born.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.661
lt's the best theory
l've heard so far.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.570
lt's the only theory
l've heard so far.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.404
And it's worth investigating.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.171
Mr. Paris, take a shuttle
to the planet

15:12.244 --> 15:14.007
and collect additional
flower specimens.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.139
Yes, ma'am, but l'd recommend
waiting until morning.

15:17.216 --> 15:18.547
The weather on the planet
can get

15:18.617 --> 15:19.743
pretty nasty at night.

15:19.818 --> 15:22.252
Very well.
You'll depart at 600 hours.

15:28.193 --> 15:30.354
Good work, Mr. Tuvix.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.544
Kes.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.512
Oh, hello.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.605
Hello.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.174
Do you need something?

15:53.252 --> 15:55.413
Actually, l was wondering

15:55.487 --> 15:57.978
if you'd like
to join me for dinner.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.082
Well, l, uh...

16:00.159 --> 16:01.057
You've already eaten?

16:01.126 --> 16:02.821
Well, no.

16:02.895 --> 16:03.793
You're not hungry?

16:03.862 --> 16:04.794
Actually...

16:04.863 --> 16:06.831
lf memory serves me,

16:06.899 --> 16:08.867
Wednesday's the day

16:08.968 --> 16:11.368
that Neelix always cooked
Trellan crepes--

16:11.437 --> 16:13.598
your favorite meal?

16:13.672 --> 16:14.696
That's right.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.866
Well, why break with tradition

16:17.009 --> 16:20.137
just because of a little
transporter accident?

16:23.749 --> 16:25.046
Somebody's eggs are burning!

16:25.117 --> 16:26.049
Those are mine.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.608
Can you flip them for me?

16:27.686 --> 16:29.176
l can't find a spatula.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.814
Just... try tossing them.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.323
Why don't you have a seat?

16:33.392 --> 16:35.417
l'll be with you in a minute.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.486
Do you mind telling me
what's going on here, crewman?

16:38.564 --> 16:40.532
We're making dinner.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.336
l see.

16:44.403 --> 16:46.496
All right, everybody out!

16:46.572 --> 16:47.664
On whose authority?

16:47.740 --> 16:50.208
Chief of Security or Head Chef--

16:50.275 --> 16:51.299
take your pick.
Out, out, out!

16:52.444 --> 16:53.411
Come, come.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.447
Out!

17:07.593 --> 17:09.356
So you really enjoyed
the crepes?

17:09.428 --> 17:11.020
Oh, they were
absolutely delicious.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.256
Don't you think Neelix

17:12.330 --> 17:13.730
always made them
a little too spicy?

17:13.799 --> 17:15.493
These were a little
different than usual.

17:15.567 --> 17:16.965
Did you change the recipe?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.025
Only slightly.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.162
l thought more moderate
seasoning would allow

17:20.239 --> 17:22.298
the flavor of the mushrooms
to come through.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.636
l loved the mushrooms.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.142
l'm glad.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.142
l can't believe

17:26.211 --> 17:27.906
how disorganized
this galley was.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.312
lt's a wonder Neelix
ever found anything.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.475
He says he has a system.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.951
But l guess
you already know that.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.486
l admire your strength, Kes.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.184
Why do you say that?

17:40.259 --> 17:41.658
l know l'm not Neelix,

17:41.727 --> 17:44.161
but l can posit
with complete certainty

17:44.229 --> 17:46.322
that if the situation
were reversed--

17:46.398 --> 17:49.925
if suddenly he found himself
without you in his life--

17:50.069 --> 17:52.503
he'd be absolutely lost.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.975
l have to go.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.242
Thanks again for dinner.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.587
Good morning, Captain.
Commander.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.253
You're here bright and early,
Lieutenant.

18:17.329 --> 18:18.990
Actually, l've been here
since 0400 hours.

18:19.064 --> 18:21.760
l wanted to work on that
proximity detector glitch

18:21.834 --> 18:23.233
in the security subroutine.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.326
And how's it going?

18:24.403 --> 18:26.371
l managed to correct it.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.030
Tuvok said it could
take up to ten days

18:28.107 --> 18:29.870
to check out all
the possible problems.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.000
How'd you fix it so fast?

18:31.076 --> 18:32.100
l had a hunch.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.144
''A hunch''?

18:33.212 --> 18:34.577
That's correct.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.136
You'll have a report
on your desk

18:36.215 --> 18:37.876
first thing this afternoon.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.076
Kim to Mr. Tuvix.

18:39.151 --> 18:40.516
Tuvix here.

18:40.586 --> 18:41.712
We're just about ready

18:41.787 --> 18:43.652
to start the transporter tests,
if you'd like to join us.

18:43.722 --> 18:44.848
l'm on my way.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.288
Excuse me, Captain.

18:50.929 --> 18:53.659
Well, he's certainly
fitting in, isn't he?

18:53.732 --> 18:55.131
There's an old axiom:

18:55.200 --> 18:58.169
''The whole is never greater
than the sum of its parts.''

18:58.237 --> 19:01.206
l think Tuvix might be
disproving that notion.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.847
Give me the flowers
from the airponics bay.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.784
Here you go.

19:15.854 --> 19:18.414
One prize-winning
chrysanthemum...

19:20.592 --> 19:23.527
one garden-variety clematis...

19:25.931 --> 19:28.593
and last but not least...

19:33.405 --> 19:36.340
one symbiogenetic alien orchid.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.347
l never thought
that botanical science class

19:42.414 --> 19:43.574
would come in so handy.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.356
Torres to Transporter Room 1.

19:51.423 --> 19:52.617
We're ready down here.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.988
Acknowledged.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.128
Energizing.

20:10.008 --> 20:13.171
We've made over 100 attempts
to reverse the symbiogenesis

20:13.245 --> 20:14.906
using the medical transporter,

20:14.980 --> 20:18.074
and each time, this has been
the unfortunate result--

20:18.150 --> 20:20.209
complete cellular collapse.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.378
The genetic codes
of the chrysanthemum

20:22.454 --> 20:24.388
and the clematis
are so scrambled

20:24.456 --> 20:25.889
that the targeting scanners

20:25.958 --> 20:27.892
can't recognize
the original patterns.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.622
l suppose it would be
like trying to extract

20:30.696 --> 20:34.097
the flour, eggs and water
after you'd baked the cake.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.929
Obviously,
in the case of Mr. Tuvix,

20:36.001 --> 20:38.993
we're dealing with a much more
complex organism than a flower.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.365
ln effect, we're talking

20:40.439 --> 20:42.407
about recreating
two humanoid life-forms

20:42.474 --> 20:44.567
without so much
as a single discrete strand

20:44.643 --> 20:45.940
of DNA to start with.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.673
Are you saying l'm going
to be this way forever?

20:49.681 --> 20:51.342
l am an incredibly
skilled doctor

20:51.416 --> 20:53.043
and l will continue to pursue

20:53.118 --> 20:56.246
a safe and effective
treatment until l find one...

20:56.321 --> 20:57.913
but l won't lie to you.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.355
l'm not optimistic.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.416
lt could take months, even
years, to find a solution.

21:02.527 --> 21:06.156
And we must face the possibility
that this condition is simply...

21:06.198 --> 21:08.189
untreatable.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.930
l feel as though
l've lost two patients.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.232
l'm sorry.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.608
l'll inform the rest
of the crew.

21:40.332 --> 21:41.629
Come in.

21:43.568 --> 21:45.468
l hope l'm not disturbing you.

21:45.537 --> 21:47.334
lt's all right.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.967
Um, please...

21:51.043 --> 21:52.408
sit down.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.139
Ocampan prayer tapers.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.646
For Tuvok and Neelix?

21:58.383 --> 21:59.509
lt's funny...

21:59.584 --> 22:03.111
if something happened to Tuvok,
if Neelix were here,

22:03.221 --> 22:05.655
he'd be the first person
to comfort me.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.921
And if l lost Neelix...

22:07.993 --> 22:12.157
Tuvok would be the first person
to guide me spiritually.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.164
Now l don't have either of them.

22:16.234 --> 22:18.725
You have me, Kes.

22:18.804 --> 22:21.637
Thank you.

22:21.707 --> 22:22.901
But...

22:22.974 --> 22:25.807
l remind you
of what you've lost.

22:25.877 --> 22:27.504
lt's not your fault.

22:27.579 --> 22:32.448
l know, and l'm trying
to accept who l am now.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.848
Captain Janeway tells me

22:33.919 --> 22:36.353
there's a place
for me on this ship...

22:36.421 --> 22:40.414
but l can't help feeling like...

22:40.492 --> 22:42.892
like some sort of impostor.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.828
Maybe we can help
each other get through this.

22:45.897 --> 22:48.127
That's what l've been hoping.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.796
l know this is going to sound
very strange to you...

22:53.872 --> 22:55.965
perhaps even illogical...

22:56.041 --> 23:00.944
since, in a way, we've only
known each other a few days.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.913
But l want you to know...

23:03.982 --> 23:05.745
l love you, Kes.

23:05.817 --> 23:08.251
But l hardly know you.

23:10.255 --> 23:13.782
A-And besides, what about...

23:13.859 --> 23:16.657
what about Tuvok's wife,
for one thing?

23:16.728 --> 23:18.457
He was completely
devoted to her.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.930
What happens when Voyager
gets back home?

23:20.999 --> 23:22.864
Are you just going
to forget her?

23:22.934 --> 23:24.925
l could never forget T'Pel.

23:25.003 --> 23:27.597
l carry Tuvok's love
for her inside me

23:27.672 --> 23:30.505
and l would never ask you
to forget Neelix.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.975
How can you talk this way?

23:33.044 --> 23:39.677
Because l carry Neelix's love
for you inside me, as well,

23:39.751 --> 23:41.412
and l always will.

23:41.486 --> 23:43.283
You heard the Doctor.

23:43.355 --> 23:44.720
lt could be years

23:44.790 --> 23:47.691
before he finds a way to bring
Tuvok and Neelix back--

23:47.759 --> 23:49.954
if ever.

23:50.028 --> 23:54.021
For you,
that might be a lifetime.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.770
Please go.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.305
l'm sorry.

24:02.340 --> 24:06.242
l should've controlled
my emotions.

24:06.311 --> 24:09.474
All l really came to say

24:09.548 --> 24:13.484
is that l'll be here for you
if you need me.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.114
Kes.

24:43.181 --> 24:44.307
Captain.

24:44.382 --> 24:45.974
l'm sorry. l shouldn't
have bothered you this late.

24:46.084 --> 24:47.551
l'll, uh, talk to you tomorrow.

24:47.619 --> 24:49.985
Actually, l was having
trouble sleeping.

24:50.055 --> 24:51.579
l could use some company.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.186
Would you like some hot tea?

24:55.260 --> 24:56.727
Please, sit down.

24:59.297 --> 25:01.822
l was just looking over
some old letters Tuvok sent me

25:02.000 --> 25:04.560
when he was temporarily
assigned to Jupiter Station.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.365
Most people would say

25:06.438 --> 25:11.307
his writing is cold,
analytical, detached, but...

25:11.376 --> 25:14.311
l've always found it to be...

25:14.379 --> 25:16.347
concise, efficient...

25:18.617 --> 25:20.812
...thoughtful.

25:20.886 --> 25:25.914
l hear his voice
when l read the words.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.117
And Neelix...

25:29.895 --> 25:32.022
l'd become so fond of him, Kes.

25:32.097 --> 25:34.930
l can't imagine
what you're going through.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.400
l wanted to talk
to you about Tuvix.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.664
He came to see me
this afternoon.

25:39.738 --> 25:40.796
Oh?

25:40.872 --> 25:44.774
He said... he said
that he loves me.

25:48.079 --> 25:50.843
l suppose l can see
how that's possible,

25:50.916 --> 25:52.315
given the circumstances.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.443
l wasn't sure what to say.

25:54.519 --> 25:56.350
At first l was angry,

25:56.421 --> 26:00.084
but l know how he's
trying to comfort me

26:00.158 --> 26:02.558
and l know that he feels alone,
too.

26:02.627 --> 26:06.427
To tell the truth,
he's a wonderful person.

26:06.498 --> 26:09.126
Do you have feelings
for him, too, Kes?

26:09.200 --> 26:10.394
No, l don't.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.260
l mean, how could l?

26:13.338 --> 26:16.000
l still love Neelix...

26:16.074 --> 26:18.542
and l'm not ready
to give up on him,

26:18.610 --> 26:20.908
no matter what the Doctor says.

26:20.979 --> 26:25.916
l know how you feel.

26:26.017 --> 26:27.177
You're experiencing

26:27.252 --> 26:29.277
what people on this crew
have been going through

26:29.354 --> 26:32.118
since we first got stranded
in this Quadrant.

26:33.458 --> 26:34.755
Do we accept

26:34.826 --> 26:38.318
that we're separated
from our loved ones forever?

26:38.396 --> 26:40.091
Or do we hold on to the hope

26:40.165 --> 26:42.895
that, someday,
we'll be with them again?

26:45.470 --> 26:47.062
What do you do, Captain?

26:48.907 --> 26:51.375
Oh... l struggle with it
every day.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.911
Sometimes, l'm full
of hope and optimism.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.012
Other times...

27:00.518 --> 27:02.884
l dream about being with Mark...

27:05.790 --> 27:07.382
...and it's so real.

27:10.528 --> 27:14.862
Then, when l wake up
and realize it's just a dream,

27:14.966 --> 27:17.025
l'm terribly discouraged.

27:19.037 --> 27:20.402
ln those moments,

27:20.472 --> 27:24.909
it's impossible to deny
just how far away he really is.

27:25.010 --> 27:27.308
And, uh...

27:31.082 --> 27:35.314
l know that, someday,

27:35.387 --> 27:40.825
l may have to accept that he's
not part of my life anymore.

27:40.892 --> 27:43.759
So, are you saying
that l should just accept

27:43.828 --> 27:46.592
that Neelix isn't a part
of my life anymore?

27:46.665 --> 27:49.498
l would never tell you
or anyone else

27:49.567 --> 27:51.330
to give up hope, Kes.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.901
l think the best thing
you can do now...

27:55.974 --> 27:58.442
is give yourself time.

28:00.145 --> 28:01.840
Thank you, Captain.

28:04.816 --> 28:08.445
l'll go now and let you sleep.

28:10.955 --> 28:14.322
My door is always open to you,
Kes.

28:31.376 --> 28:35.312
Captain's Log, Stardate 49678.4.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.075
lt's been two weeks

28:37.148 --> 28:40.345
since the transporter accident
that created Mr. Tuvix

28:40.418 --> 28:42.215
and, while it's still
not entirely clear

28:42.287 --> 28:43.811
that he's with us permanently,

28:43.888 --> 28:47.119
he's certainly been doing
his best to settle in.

28:47.192 --> 28:50.025
The crew seems to be growing
accustomed to his presence,

28:50.095 --> 28:52.655
and he's proving to be
a very able Tactical Officer

28:52.731 --> 28:55.063
who isn't afraid
to express his opinions.

28:55.133 --> 28:58.864
While he's forging relationships
with many of the officers,

28:58.937 --> 29:02.236
he seems to be keeping a
respectful distance from Kes,

29:02.340 --> 29:04.535
allowing her to adjust
to the circumstances

29:04.576 --> 29:06.441
on her own terms.

29:06.511 --> 29:09.708
As for my relationship
with Tuvix,

29:09.781 --> 29:11.715
l've found him
to be an able advisor,

29:11.783 --> 29:14.513
who skillfully uses humor
to make his points.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.420
And although l feel
a bit guilty saying it,

29:18.490 --> 29:21.118
his cooking is better
than Neelix's.

29:21.192 --> 29:24.423
My taste buds are definitely
happy to have him around.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.478
Sick Bay to Ensign Kim.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.180
Please turn to your emergency
medical holographic channel.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.425
How can l help you, Doc?

29:59.497 --> 30:00.930
Suppose l found a radioisotope

30:01.032 --> 30:03.364
that could selectively
attach itself

30:03.434 --> 30:05.061
to specific DNA sequences.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.933
Could the surgical transporters
be reprogrammed

30:07.071 --> 30:09.096
to lock on
to those enhanced sequences

30:09.174 --> 30:11.938
and separate them
from the remaining DNA?

30:12.010 --> 30:14.035
Well, l think so,

30:14.112 --> 30:16.706
but we'd have to modify
the molecular imaging scanners,

30:16.781 --> 30:20.239
and find a way to compensate for
the higher levels of radiation.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.546
Thank you, Ensign.

30:21.619 --> 30:22.984
Wait a second.

30:23.054 --> 30:25.716
What's going on?

30:25.790 --> 30:27.587
lt's pure speculation
at this point.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.752
l'll let you know
when l've learned more.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.194
This is about Tuvix, isn't it?

30:32.263 --> 30:33.457
l'm on my way.

30:45.043 --> 30:47.102
Eight ball, corner pocket.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.182
That's game again, Commander.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.417
We've created a monster.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.425
Best out of five?

31:15.073 --> 31:17.541
Would you mind if we finished
this later, Commander?

31:17.609 --> 31:18.633
Not at all.

31:25.984 --> 31:27.212
Hi.

31:27.285 --> 31:28.377
Hi.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.486
How have you been?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.994
Good days and bad days.

31:38.062 --> 31:38.994
You?

31:39.063 --> 31:40.121
Me, too.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.530
Listen, l'm sorry l've been
so distant lately.

31:42.600 --> 31:46.434
Kes, you don't owe me
an explanation.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.435
l've been doing
a lot of thinking.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.744
And l'm hoping
that we can be friends.

31:57.448 --> 32:01.885
l would like that very much.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.921
And l'd like our friendship
to grow.

32:04.022 --> 32:05.580
You would?

32:05.657 --> 32:07.124
Yes.

32:07.191 --> 32:09.182
But it's going to take time.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.754
l'm not going anywhere.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.199
Doctor to Lieutenant Tuvix.

32:21.205 --> 32:22.934
Tuvix here.

32:23.041 --> 32:25.009
Please report
to Sick Bay immediately.

32:27.445 --> 32:30.414
Until late in the 21st century,

32:30.481 --> 32:32.415
physicians administered
barium to patients

32:32.483 --> 32:34.314
with certain
gastrointestinal disorders.

32:34.385 --> 32:36.182
The radioactive properties
of the barium

32:36.254 --> 32:37.812
made the lining
of the intestines visible,

32:37.889 --> 32:40.517
with a primitive imaging
technology called X rays.

32:40.591 --> 32:44.459
lnstead of barium, we've
come up with a radioisotope

32:44.529 --> 32:45.461
that attaches itself

32:45.530 --> 32:47.191
to the DNA of one
of the merged species,

32:47.265 --> 32:49.426
but not the other.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.764
Then we simply beam out
the selected DNA,

32:51.836 --> 32:54.430
and segregate
the two merged species.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.907
You see these?

32:59.978 --> 33:03.141
They used to be
a single merged flower.

33:03.247 --> 33:04.612
And you can use
this same process?

33:04.649 --> 33:05.741
lt will require

33:05.817 --> 33:08.081
a more detailed reprogramming
of the transporter,

33:08.152 --> 33:10.848
but, yes, l believe
we can restore

33:10.922 --> 33:13.686
Mr. Tuvok and Mr. Neelix.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.521
That's wonderful.

33:15.593 --> 33:16.855
lsn't that wonderful?

33:18.162 --> 33:20.926
l assure you, Mr. Tuvix,
there's nothing to worry about.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.830
We've accounted
for every variable.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.332
Except one.

33:27.572 --> 33:30.063
l don't want to die.

33:39.817 --> 33:41.182
lt's funny...

33:41.252 --> 33:44.585
if we'd had the ability
to separate Tuvok and Neelix

33:44.655 --> 33:46.623
the moment Tuvix came aboard...

33:46.691 --> 33:48.283
l wouldn't have hesitated.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.883
Of course not.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.326
But now...

33:51.396 --> 33:53.330
in the past few weeks...

33:53.398 --> 33:57.334
he's begun to make a life
for himself on this ship.

33:57.402 --> 33:59.302
He's taken on
responsibilities...

33:59.370 --> 34:00.462
made friends...

34:00.571 --> 34:03.301
l count myself as one of them.

34:03.341 --> 34:06.435
So, at what point did
he become an individual

34:06.511 --> 34:08.672
and not a transporter accident?

34:13.684 --> 34:14.650
Come in.

34:16.286 --> 34:18.221
You wanted to see me, Captain?

34:20.358 --> 34:21.848
Yes, Mr. Tuvix.

34:21.926 --> 34:23.553
Please, sit down.

34:27.431 --> 34:28.831
l feel as though

34:28.900 --> 34:31.926
l've been dragged in front
of the Numirian lnquisition.

34:32.003 --> 34:34.835
Will you excuse us, Commander?

34:39.444 --> 34:42.844
We've just been discussing
the unfortunate...

34:42.914 --> 34:46.714
predicament
that we're all facing,

34:46.784 --> 34:50.481
and l thought it was important
to get your perspective

34:50.554 --> 34:52.819
before making a decision.

34:52.889 --> 34:56.553
Are you suggesting that this
is your decision to make?

34:56.627 --> 34:58.959
l am the Captain of this ship.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.089
Begging your pardon, Captain,

35:01.199 --> 35:02.564
it's my life.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.158
lsn't it my decision?

35:04.235 --> 35:07.432
Aren't there two other lives
to consider here?

35:07.505 --> 35:09.735
What about Tuvok and Neelix--

35:09.807 --> 35:13.436
two voices that we
can't hear right now?

35:13.511 --> 35:16.776
As Captain,
l must be their voice,

35:16.848 --> 35:19.612
and l believe
they would want to live.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.584
But they are living, in a way.

35:21.652 --> 35:22.778
lnside me.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.118
lt's not the same.

35:25.189 --> 35:27.555
And l think you'd agree with me.

35:30.194 --> 35:32.059
They have families.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.358
Friends.

35:33.431 --> 35:35.160
People who love them

35:35.233 --> 35:37.827
and miss them
and want them back,

35:37.902 --> 35:39.301
just as l do.

35:39.370 --> 35:43.739
But restoring their lives
means sacrificing mine.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.036
Captain...

35:45.109 --> 35:48.476
what you're considering
is an execution.

35:48.546 --> 35:50.207
An execution--

35:50.281 --> 35:53.216
like they used to do
to murderers centuries ago--

35:53.284 --> 35:55.582
and l've committed
no crime at all.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.679
Aren't you arguing
for an execution, too--

35:58.756 --> 36:00.587
of Tuvok and Neelix?

36:00.691 --> 36:03.285
l'm here-- alive.

36:03.327 --> 36:06.262
Unfortunate as it may be,
they're gone.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.798
And l have an opportunity
to bring them back.

36:08.866 --> 36:13.269
Don't you think that l care
about Tuvok and Neelix?

36:13.337 --> 36:14.861
Of course l do!

36:14.939 --> 36:17.373
Without them, l wouldn't exist.

36:17.441 --> 36:20.171
ln a way, l think of them
as my parents.

36:20.244 --> 36:22.712
l feel like
l know them intimately.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.873
Then you know Tuvok was a man

36:25.016 --> 36:28.315
who would gladly give
his life to save another.

36:28.386 --> 36:31.355
And l believe the same
was true of Neelix.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.720
You're right, Captain.

36:36.727 --> 36:39.025
That is the Starfleet way.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.730
And l know there'll be
some people

36:42.800 --> 36:44.597
who will call me a coward

36:44.669 --> 36:48.435
because l didn't
sacrifice myself willingly.

36:48.506 --> 36:52.203
Believe me,
l've thought of that.

36:52.276 --> 36:55.939
But l have the will to live
of two men.

36:56.080 --> 36:59.982
Look at me, Captain.

37:00.017 --> 37:03.418
When l'm happy, l laugh.

37:03.487 --> 37:05.148
When l'm sad, l cry.

37:05.223 --> 37:09.683
When l stub my toe,
l yell out in pain.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.092
l'm flesh and blood.

37:12.163 --> 37:17.032
And l... have the right
to live!

37:35.386 --> 37:36.683
Kes...

37:38.189 --> 37:40.657
l need your help.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.750
l've just come from the Captain,

37:42.827 --> 37:45.091
and she's thinking
about forcing me

37:45.162 --> 37:47.562
to go through
with the separation.

37:49.367 --> 37:52.768
lf anybody can make
a difference, Kes, it's you.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.702
She'll listen to you.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.933
We've helped each other
through this,

37:57.041 --> 38:02.411
and l know that you care
about what happens to me.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.414
Please.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.950
Kes, you may be my only hope.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.355
Come in.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.221
Captain...

38:21.299 --> 38:24.462
Tuvix has asked me
to speak to you on his behalf.

38:28.339 --> 38:31.035
But l can't.

38:31.108 --> 38:33.269
He shouldn't have put you
in the middle of this.

38:33.344 --> 38:34.971
But l am in the middle.

38:35.046 --> 38:38.015
l have been since
the moment of the accident.

38:39.517 --> 38:42.748
l don't know how to say good-bye
to Neelix and Tuvok.

38:45.623 --> 38:48.183
l know this sounds horrible...

38:48.259 --> 38:51.228
and l feel so guilty
for saying it...

38:53.297 --> 38:56.789
and Tuvix doesn't
deserve to die...

38:58.135 --> 39:01.400
but l want Neelix back.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.012
You're excused, Ensign.

39:24.829 --> 39:27.389
Mr. Paris,
what is our present speed?

39:27.465 --> 39:29.831
Warp 6.5.

39:29.900 --> 39:33.859
l'd like to conduct a field test
of the aft sensor array.

39:33.971 --> 39:36.269
Please, slow to impulse.

39:38.242 --> 39:39.470
Commander?

39:39.543 --> 39:42.376
Until the Captain
makes a decision,

39:42.446 --> 39:45.745
Mr. Tuvix is still
the Tactical Officer.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.542
Mr. Tuvix?

40:14.912 --> 40:16.937
l'd like to speak to you alone.

40:17.081 --> 40:19.743
Can l assume that you've
come to a decision, Captain?

40:21.352 --> 40:22.979
l have.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.818
l think we all should hear
what you have to say!

40:28.392 --> 40:30.417
Please come with me, Mr. Tuvix.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.624
No.

40:34.799 --> 40:38.599
l'm ordering you
to come with me.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.836
Security to the Bridge.

40:44.909 --> 40:47.673
Commander, are you going
to stand by and do nothing

40:47.745 --> 40:49.508
while she commits murder?!

40:51.348 --> 40:52.337
Wha..?

40:52.416 --> 40:53.747
Mr. Ayala!

40:55.586 --> 40:56.883
Yes...

40:56.954 --> 40:59.218
Lieutenant Paris...

40:59.290 --> 41:00.348
you...

41:03.527 --> 41:06.826
Doesn't anyone see
that this is wrong?!

41:27.084 --> 41:29.416
Let him go.

41:33.724 --> 41:39.060
Each of you is going to have
to live with this...

41:40.431 --> 41:42.991
and l'm sorry for that.

41:43.100 --> 41:47.264
For you are all good...
good people.

41:48.772 --> 41:50.501
My colleagues.

41:53.544 --> 41:55.068
My friends.

41:59.416 --> 42:01.816
l forgive you.

42:14.765 --> 42:16.357
Commander Chakotay,

42:16.433 --> 42:19.425
advise the Doctor
we're on our way to Sick Bay.

42:22.706 --> 42:24.264
Deck 5.

42:42.760 --> 42:44.660
l'm sorry, Captain,

42:44.728 --> 42:47.595
but l cannot perform
the surgical separation.

42:47.665 --> 42:52.625
l am a physician,
and a physician must do no harm.

42:52.703 --> 42:56.230
l will not take Mr. Tuvix' life
against his will.

42:56.307 --> 42:58.969
Very well, Doctor.

42:59.043 --> 43:01.068
Please step aside.

43:10.020 --> 43:12.989
l assume this is
the radioisotope.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.858
Please sit down on this bio-bed.

43:49.426 --> 43:51.656
Locking surgical
targeting scanners

43:51.729 --> 43:54.823
onto the isotope probe.

43:54.898 --> 43:58.026
lnitiating separation sequence.

44:06.510 --> 44:08.273
Energizing.

44:24.395 --> 44:25.521
Neelix!

44:25.596 --> 44:27.826
Hello, sweeting!

44:29.566 --> 44:31.295
Greetings, Captain.

44:31.368 --> 44:33.928
Mr. Tuvok...

44:34.038 --> 44:36.506
Mr. Neelix...

44:36.573 --> 44:38.700
it's good to have you back.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
