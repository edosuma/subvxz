00:01.305 --> 00:03.003
Previously onInstinct...

00:03.046 --> 00:05.440
Welcome
to Abnormal Behavioral Analysis.

00:05.483 --> 00:07.094
My name is
Professor Dylan Reinhart.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.400
Detective
Elizabeth Needham, NYPD.

00:09.444 --> 00:10.749
You're gonna be a great father.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.839
Any child would be lucky
to have you and Andy

00:13.883 --> 00:14.797
as their dads.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.541
You're not just
some boring old professor.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.891
You're CIA?
Retired?

00:21.934 --> 00:23.371
DYLAN:
You can't access
sealed documents?

00:23.414 --> 00:25.199
That's why they're sealed.That's why I have friends.

00:25.242 --> 00:28.811
Don't tell me-- you need intel,
and the NYPD's slowing you down.

00:28.854 --> 00:31.292
Just in case.If I were to call,
what would I call you?

00:31.335 --> 00:32.249
Julian.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.775
DYLAN: Any idea who broke in? JULIAN:
No, it was a professional.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.081
Well, I needed
a safe place to work

00:38.125 --> 00:39.691
until I find
a secure space.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.694
Uh, Lizzie, Dylan, meet Jules,
our new computer associate.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.696
Nice to meet you both.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.698
Detective Ryan Stock,
Garfield County PD.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.483
I think your case
may be related

00:48.526 --> 00:50.876
to a murder I'm investigating
in Garfield.

00:51.616 --> 00:54.315
The "Sleeping Beauties" case.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.407
[couple laughing]

00:59.450 --> 01:00.408
Trust me.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.018
You got to trust me.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.803
This is the most romantic thing
a dude's ever done for me.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.022
[laughs]

01:06.066 --> 01:07.502
And you're sure
this is cool?

01:07.545 --> 01:08.894
Oh, the coolest.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.245
I mean, this is
the most important ride here,

01:11.288 --> 01:12.985
and I operate it,

01:13.029 --> 01:15.814
so I pretty much run this place.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.339
Nothing sexier
than a powerful man.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.863
[grunts]

01:20.906 --> 01:22.691
Check this out.

01:25.911 --> 01:29.959
Looks like you had a little
practice pulling that lever.

01:30.002 --> 01:33.484
Maybe you could give me a hand.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.879
[screaming]

01:40.926 --> 01:42.972
To the right are
private adoption options,

01:43.015 --> 01:44.843
to the left are
surrogacy agencies,

01:44.887 --> 01:47.107
and in the middle, foster
care opportunities.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.195
You really think
this is enough?

01:48.238 --> 01:50.501
Mm! I'm glad
you said that.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.024
It was a joke.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.506
[rattling]

01:58.074 --> 02:00.163
Come on, we talked
about this.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.991
No whiteboards
in the dining room.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.558
I've broken down our
options into categories,

02:03.601 --> 02:06.996
subcategories,
and sub-subcategories.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.738
Like they're suspects
in a murder investigation.

02:09.781 --> 02:12.088
Think about it
as a birth investigation.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.916
Take it all in.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.439
I got to go to work.

02:15.483 --> 02:16.658
[sighs]

02:18.703 --> 02:21.097
We really diving back in?

02:23.795 --> 02:25.232
Only if you're ready.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.932
Let's go investigate a birth.

02:29.975 --> 02:32.064
[chuckles]

02:40.377 --> 02:42.031
I miss waking
up with you.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.599
Mm! That would have
sounded so sweet

02:44.642 --> 02:46.818
if you weren't
yelling it in my face.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.516
What exactly
happened last night?

02:48.559 --> 02:51.301
After you snuck out,
Jasmine and I had a few.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.347
And by a few,
I mean bottles.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.523
Drinking on a school night?
How very un-Lizzie of you.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.394
Jasmine broke off
her engagement to David,

02:57.438 --> 02:59.222
which, by the way,
is confidential.

02:59.266 --> 03:02.051
Sounds like she
needed a friend.

03:02.094 --> 03:04.880
Pretty sure I brushed my teeth
with sunscreen this morning.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.708
Can I see if I
can guess the SPF?

03:06.751 --> 03:10.886
Mm-mm! Just stay on your side of
the car, and no one gets hurt.

03:10.929 --> 03:14.324
As soon as I finish wiping
the spyware from the server,

03:14.368 --> 03:16.500
you'll be rid of me.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.633
In the precinct, anyway.

03:18.676 --> 03:21.984
It's actually nice to see you.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.725
Oh, and also, we're gonna
need to figure out

03:23.768 --> 03:26.118
new arrangements now that
Jasmine's living with me.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.120
Wait, what?

03:30.384 --> 03:32.386
Excuse me, you can't be there.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.126
Do you mind? Hey.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.911
Oh, no, it's, uh, it's okay.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.129
Uh, no, it's not.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.393
You must be Detective Needham.

03:39.436 --> 03:40.829
Who are you?

03:40.872 --> 03:42.613
Detective Ryan Stock.
I'm part of the joint task force

03:42.657 --> 03:45.399
working
the Sleeping Beauty case.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.052
What Sleeping Beauty case?

03:47.096 --> 03:49.446
Uh, yeah, I know that
you were the first on scene.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.143
I was hoping I could
get your opinion.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.755
You want my opinion?
You need a shave and a haircut.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.496
[chuckles]:
Wow, you sound like my mom.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.107
Morning, Lizzie.
Wrapping the dead

03:58.150 --> 04:00.152
in a blanket was
a Native American ritual

04:00.196 --> 04:02.067
when there wasn't enough time
for a proper burial.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.113
It was done as an act of love.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.768
So our, our killer
cared about his victims?

04:06.811 --> 04:09.336
Or wants us to thinks so.
Or he-- or she...

04:09.379 --> 04:11.599
[laughs]
...was a Native American.

04:11.642 --> 04:14.471
I'm sorry, did I just, uh,
step into a parallel universe?

04:14.515 --> 04:16.604
Who is this guy, and why
is he leaning on your desk?

04:16.647 --> 04:17.909
No, this is, uh, Ryan.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.737
I'm helping him with the
Sleeping Beauty case.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.739
What Sleeping Beauty case?Oh, you know.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.787
Mm-mm. I can't right now.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.314
[quietly]:
Oh, my God.

04:31.358 --> 04:34.317
Don't even start-- I have
a nuclear-powered hangover,

04:34.361 --> 04:37.015
and I need an aspirin big enough
to eat with a knife and fork.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.582
Lizzie, it's Tuesday morning.

04:38.626 --> 04:39.931
This is entirely
Jasmine's fault.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.585
My only solace is knowing

04:41.629 --> 04:43.848
that she's suffering
far worse than I am.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.197
Good morning, everyone.

04:45.241 --> 04:46.721
Can I have
your attention?

04:46.764 --> 04:49.593
The body of the young woman
found in the park,

04:49.637 --> 04:51.595
wrapped in the blanket,
was recently flagged

04:51.639 --> 04:54.250
through the Fusion Center
by the Garfield County PD

04:54.294 --> 04:56.165
out in Nebraska.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.689
It is their belief our victim
shares similarities

04:58.733 --> 05:00.212
to one of their cold cases.

05:00.256 --> 05:03.607
As a result, they've sent
Detective Stock to aid Fucci

05:03.651 --> 05:06.958
in the effort to connect
and solve both murders.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.526
He's a guest in our home,
so please make him feel welcome.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.311
Um, Lieutenant Gooden,
I'd like that case.

05:11.354 --> 05:12.442
I think I could be of help.

05:12.486 --> 05:13.922
I'm sure you could.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.837
No, the methods of killing
suggest unique psychopathy

05:15.880 --> 05:16.968
and intense rage.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.187
Which I'm starting to feel
right now.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.232
You and Lizzie will go
to Land of Wonder.

05:20.276 --> 05:23.192
Gunshot victim,
found on the roller coaster.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.716
Roller coaster?
That sounds intriguing.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.458
Oh, and just like that,
he's happy again. Come on.

05:28.502 --> 05:32.027
Driver's license IDs the vic
as a 22-year-old male

05:32.070 --> 05:33.420
named Elliot Emerson.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.813
We're holding the name
until we find next of kin.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.467
LIZZIE:
But he had his wallet on him.

05:37.511 --> 05:40.035
Yeah, with a 20 inside, which
rules out robbery as a motive.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.124
Blood spatter suggests he was
shot while seated in the car.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.691
What was he doing sitting
in a roller coaster

05:43.734 --> 05:45.170
in the middle of the night?Getting shot.

05:45.214 --> 05:48.130
Uh, gunshot wound
to the chest.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.175
We should be able
to recover a slug.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.612
I got a team
searching garbage cans

05:51.655 --> 05:53.918
for the murder weapon.
So far, all we've come up with

05:53.962 --> 05:55.703
is a couple stuffed animals,
a whole lot of vomit.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.358
It takes a unique kind of sadist
to stuff someone

05:58.401 --> 05:59.750
full of fried food,

05:59.794 --> 06:02.144
then put them on a ride that
shakes up their insides.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.712
Or shoves a corn dog in their
face while they're hungover.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.368
[grunts]

06:10.413 --> 06:11.762
A lapel mic.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.373
He was wearing a wire?

06:13.416 --> 06:15.984
Maybe the kid was an informant?

06:16.027 --> 06:17.028
DYLAN:
If he was, he didn't do

06:17.072 --> 06:18.595
a very good job
of concealing it.

06:18.639 --> 06:19.944
Explains the gunshot
to the chest.

06:19.988 --> 06:23.034
Maybe he recorded his own death.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.035
Could you?

06:24.079 --> 06:26.081
You do know I'm your boss.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.737
You do know I'm yourboss.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.048
Looks like
he was recording a song.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.660
♪ It's like I'm living

06:39.703 --> 06:41.662
♪ In a play...

06:41.705 --> 06:43.490
ANNIE [groans]:
Let me through!

06:43.533 --> 06:45.796
Hey!

06:45.840 --> 06:47.494
You can't be here.Come on, Annie. It's not him.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.713
No, it is. It's
Elliot. I can feel it.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.193
LIZZIE: I thought you said
the name hasn't been released.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.455
It hasn't.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.674
Let's get out of here.Wh-Whoa, no, whoa, whoa!

06:53.717 --> 06:56.154
No, not without saying goodbye!

06:56.198 --> 06:58.069
Hey, there's no way
that you can know who that is

06:58.113 --> 06:59.680
unless you had something
to do with it.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.159
No, I didn't!

07:01.203 --> 07:03.031
Then how could you possibly
know who our victim is?

07:04.075 --> 07:06.469
Because he's my twin.

07:08.993 --> 07:11.256
♪

07:19.874 --> 07:22.920
Did Elliot tell you he was
gonna be out here last night?

07:22.964 --> 07:25.445
I just had a feeling.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.099
Yeah, we were, we were
watching the news.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.710
It mentioned a body.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.233
Do you know why he was here?

07:31.276 --> 07:34.105
No.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.759
Hey, I don't think we
should do this right now.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.108
She just saw her
brother's dead body.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.762
Jason, it's okay.

07:40.808 --> 07:45.116
It seems Elliot
was here writing music.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.555
Would he usually do that
in such a remote location?

07:48.598 --> 07:49.730
He found inspiration

07:49.773 --> 07:51.949
in solitude.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.908
"At night," um,

07:53.951 --> 07:56.606
"when the world finally shut
the hell up," he'd say.

07:58.739 --> 08:01.481
Annie, I noticed you have
calluses on your fingers.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.308
Are you a musician, too?

08:03.352 --> 08:05.833
Yeah, Elliot and I had a band.

08:05.876 --> 08:08.836
I played guitar
and sang,

08:08.879 --> 08:11.795
and he did everything else.

08:11.839 --> 08:12.970
He wrote, composed,

08:13.014 --> 08:15.495
played the
keyboard. Um...

08:16.844 --> 08:19.847
...my brother was a genius.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.328
Any disputes with any neighbors?

08:23.372 --> 08:24.939
Nah, kid kept to himself.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.636
Why, you think
it was personal?

08:26.680 --> 08:28.333
Like, someone he knew iced him?

08:28.377 --> 08:30.510
Thank you for letting us in.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.642
We'll be in touch if
we need anything else.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.122
Which is code for "screw off."

08:34.165 --> 08:36.690
It certainly is. Thank you,
have a nice day, Randy.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.043
Huh.

08:43.566 --> 08:44.611
Twins seem close.

08:44.654 --> 08:45.655
DYLAN:
Well, she might have

08:45.699 --> 08:47.004
gotten under
the boyfriend's skin.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.963
He couldn't come between 'em,
leaving him jealous.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.530
He did seem overprotective.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.531
Mm.

08:51.574 --> 08:54.664
Look at this place.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.362
No TV, no books, no alcohol.

08:57.406 --> 09:00.757
He doesn't even
have a computer.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.933
DYLAN: He certainly
has a lot of records.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.369
Maybe he didn't need
anything else.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.677
If music was
his primary relationship

09:07.721 --> 09:09.200
with the world, his passion,

09:09.244 --> 09:10.637
his life, I think
there's a pretty good chance

09:10.680 --> 09:12.160
it may have played a part

09:12.203 --> 09:14.118
in his death.

09:14.162 --> 09:18.122
Music did not put a hole
in Elliot's chest.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.951
A gun did that
in a dangerous location,

09:20.995 --> 09:23.084
in the middle
of the night.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.434
You don't go there
to find solitude.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.697
There's something more
to this kid.

09:30.439 --> 09:33.660
Nick Drake. I love this record.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.357
Look at this kid's collection.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.012
He's got everything.
Every genre, every period.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.710
He's a total music nerd.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.364
Well, you're the authority.

09:50.502 --> 09:53.114
They're all broken.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.725
Someone didn't like his record
collection as much as you do.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.640
Or they didn't like Elliot.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.948
My money is on this Ross guy.

10:00.991 --> 10:04.734
There's pages and pages
of IOUs in this book.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.649
Almost $9,000.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.521
I know how to find him.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.741
You want to see?

10:22.970 --> 10:24.928
Are you Ross Dirkson?

10:24.972 --> 10:26.408
I'm Detective Needham,

10:26.451 --> 10:28.628
this is my partner
Dr. Dylan Reinhart.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.020
We have a few questions.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.022
About Elliot. Yeah, of course.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.154
So you know.

10:33.197 --> 10:35.635
I was sick to my stomach
when I heard.

10:35.678 --> 10:36.940
He was my guy.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.029
And yet you're here.I'd tried

10:39.073 --> 10:40.988
to call in sick, but I'm
the assistant manager

10:41.031 --> 10:43.251
and my boss is on vacation.

10:43.294 --> 10:46.080
You were Annie & Elliot's
band manager, is that correct?

10:46.123 --> 10:47.472
Yeah, the three of us moved here

10:47.516 --> 10:49.692
from Jersey a few years back
to give it a go.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.172
Mm. And in that time,
you loaned Elliot

10:51.215 --> 10:52.739
quite a bit of money,
didn't you?

10:52.782 --> 10:56.873
I lent him a few bucks here
and there for guitar picks,

10:56.917 --> 10:58.701
groceries, stuff like that.
I was happy to help.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.704
Said he'd hit me back
once we'd made it.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.446
Besides, Elliot didn't need
much. He lived like a monk.

11:04.489 --> 11:07.275
The band's website says
that Annie & Elliot perform

11:07.318 --> 11:10.017
most weekends, but they haven't
played a show in over a month.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.192
Why is that?

11:11.235 --> 11:12.367
Because that's
when they broke up.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.717
Uh, there was no bad
blood between them.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.502
Except for Jason, Annie's
boyfriend, got kind of pissed.

11:17.546 --> 11:20.723
But Elliot and Annie,
they were super close.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.246
Inseparable, actually.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.421
And yet they split up.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.075
Elliot thought it was time

11:25.119 --> 11:27.425
to take things
in a new direction.

11:27.469 --> 11:29.906
He'd been experimenting
with different sounds,

11:29.950 --> 11:32.213
wanted to try something
more unconventional.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.084
We slipped a few
of his solo tracks to a guy

11:34.128 --> 11:36.478
at Marble Note Records,
and there'd been talk of a deal.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.959
And before you ask,
Annie knew about the deal.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.961
She was happy for Elliot.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.137
I'd like to hear his solo work.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.443
Elliot kept it under lock
and key on his computer.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.532
He was super protective
of his music.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.578
We weren't able to retrieve
a computer from the apartment.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.711
It's probably at
the storage unit.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.800
Elliot started recording there
a few weeks ago.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.268
You don't get pleasure
from music.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.096
You're a musical snob.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.229

serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin,

any pleasure from music?

15:25.663 --> 15:27.839
What could possiblybe
insulting about that?

15:27.883 --> 15:30.712
It's just that, for some of us,
life would be unimaginable

15:30.755 --> 15:32.453
without music. I think
Elliot was that way, too.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.107
Yeah, but maybe
it wasn't enough.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.456

to break free.

31:41.638 --> 31:42.596
From what?

31:42.639 --> 31:43.945
From the feeling

31:43.989 --> 31:45.773
he'd experienced
everything before.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.906
That his present life
had already happened.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.733
Please don't tell me
you're suggesting

31:49.777 --> 31:50.909
he was a time traveler.

31:53.824 --> 31:57.002
There is a mental condition
known as persistent déjà vu.

31:57.045 --> 32:00.614
It's an extremely rare symptom
of temporal lobe epilepsy, TLE.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.094
Epilepsy?

32:02.137 --> 32:04.444
Annie and Elliot's mom died
after suffering a seizure.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.925
If she was epileptic, there's
a good chance Elliot was, too.

32:06.968 --> 32:09.101
And if so, that would make
persistent déjà vu

32:09.144 --> 32:10.798
a real possibility
and help explain

32:10.841 --> 32:13.192
his radical change of behavior.

32:14.758 --> 32:18.023
I'm not going home yet, am I?

32:18.066 --> 32:21.069
TLE can cause nonconvulsive
seizure activity,

32:21.113 --> 32:23.724
which is what would have led to
the intense feelings of déjà vu.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.682
As an artist, it would
have made him feel

32:25.726 --> 32:28.294
that everything he tried
to create was unoriginal.

32:28.337 --> 32:30.165
Which is why he seemed
so bored by everything.

32:30.209 --> 32:32.341
He would've been emotionally
and artistically numb,

32:32.385 --> 32:34.691
which could explain why
he was on the roller coaster.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.519
He was trying to get back
to a place

32:36.563 --> 32:39.000
where he could feel something,
even if it was fear.

32:39.044 --> 32:42.221
If he was artistically numb,
how could he create great music?

32:42.264 --> 32:45.006
Oh, he had no problem
creating great music.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.834
He just wasn't aware
the music was great

32:46.877 --> 32:48.488
because the déjà vu
made him think

32:48.531 --> 32:49.837
he'd created it all before.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.839
Which would have
driven him crazy.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.667
And caused him to have
negative feelings

32:53.710 --> 32:55.799
about the things
that used to bring him joy.

32:55.843 --> 32:57.671

hippocampus.

33:08.464 --> 33:11.380
He was suffering
from temporal lobe epilepsy.

33:11.424 --> 33:12.860
Now we just need to figure out

33:12.903 --> 33:14.862
who'd have the most
to gain with Elliot dead.

33:14.905 --> 33:16.907
Well, Annie may have had
something to gain,

33:16.951 --> 33:19.171
but I think the damage
from the loss of her twin

33:19.214 --> 33:20.868
makes her involvement
highly unlikely.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.305
If Jason was jealous, then
getting Elliot out of the way

33:23.349 --> 33:24.828
would be a potential motive.

There's a contract between

34:21.885 --> 34:23.235
the record company and Elliot.

34:23.278 --> 34:25.367
It's a 360-degree deal.
All income is to be split

34:25.411 --> 34:27.369

and Ross, his manager.

there is no way

34:42.819 --> 34:44.517

have signed that contract.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.954
Ross was an assistant
manager at a bar

34:46.997 --> 34:48.825
who lent what little money
he had to Elliot.

34:48.869 --> 34:51.219
That contract had to be
very lucrative for him.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.003

34:53.047 --> 34:54.440
refusing to cash in
on their dreams,

34:54.483 --> 34:55.876
would certainly
have enraged him.

34:55.919 --> 34:58.400

to drive him to kill.

We need to place Ross
at the scene of the crime.

35:08.149 --> 35:09.716

something behind.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.370
Ross isn't
a professional killer.

35:12.588 --> 35:14.329

in a fit of rage.

35:16.331 --> 35:18.290
You okay?

35:18.333 --> 35:19.900
If Ross killed Elliot
out of anger

35:19.943 --> 35:22.294

to process what he'd just done,

35:22.337 --> 35:23.991

thrown up.

were all taken

40:01.877 --> 40:04.314
before I hit the reset button.
Come on, you know me.

40:04.358 --> 40:05.533
This is what I do.

40:05.577 --> 40:08.754
This is what you did
a long time ago,

40:08.797 --> 40:12.018
before you were engaged
and making giant life decisions.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.414
A lot more than
a relationship went away

40:16.457 --> 40:17.719
when you broke up with David.

40:17.763 --> 40:20.853
You were planning on
having kids with him,

40:20.896 --> 40:22.463
and you know you made
the right choice,

40:22.507 --> 40:25.858
so maybe we can just talk
about it without loud music

40:25.901 --> 40:27.947
and underage kids
and any merlot.

40:30.036 --> 40:33.039
I don't think I can
delve into it just yet,

40:33.082 --> 40:35.607
but I can stay in,

40:35.650 --> 40:39.219
order a pizza, watch a movie,
with just a little merlot.

40:39.262 --> 40:42.918
[laughs] See, I love that idea.

40:42.962 --> 40:46.226
There's just one thing
we have to do first.

40:49.925 --> 40:52.798
Hey.

40:52.841 --> 40:57.280
So, uh... this is the
part where I apologize.

40:57.324 --> 40:59.457
I was wrong
to suggest

40:59.500 --> 41:00.893
you don't care
about your family

41:00.936 --> 41:02.764
as much as you care
about your work.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.464
You know,
when I was a kid,

41:06.507 --> 41:10.685
music was
my safe place.

41:10.729 --> 41:14.689
Then it was the CIA,
and now it's you.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.953
And the family
we're gonna have.

41:20.390 --> 41:22.784
Nothing is more important.

41:22.828 --> 41:24.786
Then let's just do it.

41:24.830 --> 41:28.094
Let's just pick an option
and get the process rolling.

41:28.137 --> 41:30.531
Actually, I have another idea.

41:30.575 --> 41:33.273
Let's not waste time worrying
about the next step.

41:33.316 --> 41:34.970
What are you saying?

41:35.014 --> 41:37.495
I'm saying
let's pursue them all.

41:37.538 --> 41:39.409
All at the same time?
[chuckles]

41:39.453 --> 41:42.500
Do you have any idea how
much work that's gonna be?

41:44.545 --> 41:46.504
You only live once.
