00:02.869 --> 00:05.531
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.605 --> 00:08.096
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.173 --> 00:10.574
[ Michael Narrating]
Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.643 --> 00:13.203
no cash, no credit,
nojob history.

00:13.279 --> 00:16.407
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.483 --> 00:18.110
Miami.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.812
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.879
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.957 --> 00:26.482
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.559 --> 00:29.392
an old friend who's informing
on you to the F..B.I.--

00:29.462 --> 00:31.760
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.163
- F.amily too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.234 --> 00:36.395
- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.801
Bottom line:
Untilyou figure out who burnedyou...

- [ Gun Cocks ]
- Whoa! Mike, easy.

00:59.926 --> 01:02.190
- That'll kill you, you know.
- Yeah, no kiddin'.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.321
No, the bucket of
trans fat you got there.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.764
Did Veronica call you? 'Cause ifyou're
taking her side on this whole cholesterol thing...

01:07.834 --> 01:10.200
it's gonna put a serious strain
on our friendship.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.761
- No, you can binge in peace, Sam.
- Yeah, well, thanks.

01:12.839 --> 01:16.468
But that's not the only reason
why I'm here, you know. I got a job offer.

01:19.479 --> 01:22.812
Uh, here we go.
Pete-- one of my buddies from the SEAL teams--

01:22.882 --> 01:24.816
he's got a lady
who's got some problems.

01:24.884 --> 01:27.910
She called him 'cause he's in Special Forces.
But he's got this blood pressure thing...

01:27.987 --> 01:29.921
so he called me.

01:29.989 --> 01:32.219
- What doyou say?
- My plate's a little full, Sam.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.317
What, you mean with this
whole Philip Cowan thing?

01:34.394 --> 01:36.828
Mike, you're doing armed sit-ups.
I'm worried aboutyou.

01:36.896 --> 01:39.922
- I thought this might getyour mind offit.
- Cowan burned me.

01:39.999 --> 01:43.127
Cowan sent someone to kill me.
Now he dropped off grid.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.797
- I need my mind focused on this.
- All right. Fair enough.

01:45.872 --> 01:49.205
- You mind ifl run with this? The money's not bad.
- No. Knockyourself out.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.209
All right.

- [ Sighs ]
- Well, it looks likeyour buddy Cowan
finally made contact.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.258
You want me to come with,
backyou up?

02:06.326 --> 02:09.523
- Sure. Bring your bucket offat.
- I'll bring my chicken too.

- Yeah, Sam.
- Well, it's the witching hour.

02:26.513 --> 02:30.210
- Looks likeyour buddy didn't show.
- He wouldn't just not show up.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.342
- He's watching.
- You think?

02:33.653 --> 02:36.019

- Think he wants to meet.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.742
- So why not just meet?
- He doesn't trust me.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.980
F.air enough.
I don't trust him.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.183
[ Michael Narrating]
The first step in dealing with a covert op...

03:45.258 --> 03:48.250
is establishing a way
to communicate privately, a code.

03:48.328 --> 03:51.422
Could be a key-encrypted cipher.
But, really...

03:51.497 --> 03:53.795
allyou need is a base
ofknowledge thatyou share.

03:53.866 --> 03:57.131
He knows my enti re career--
falsified a good bit of it.

03:57.203 --> 04:00.639
It shouldn't be too difficult for him
to figure out a way to talk to me.

04:00.707 --> 04:04.609
Ah, the mating dance of the spy.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.942
It's a wonder spies everget close enough
to kill each other, isn't it?

04:08.014 --> 04:11.711
- Oh, gotta go.
- Veronica has you on a pretty tight leash, huh?

04:11.784 --> 04:14.150

I'm meeting with a prospective client.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.882

whatever it is you do.

Thanks for meeting me.
I-- I thought there were two ofyou.

04:37.810 --> 04:41.211
Uh, yeah, usually, but my partner's
on somethin' else right now. But it's fine.

04:43.149 --> 04:46.710
So, um, Pete says
you're having some trouble?

04:46.786 --> 04:49.152
Uh, I'm a supervisor at S.X.G.

04:49.222 --> 04:54.319
We build planes, satellites, weapons systems.
Government contracts.

04:54.394 --> 04:58.353
Been working there 1 0 years.
It's a good job.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.899
- Areyou okay?
- I--

05:00.967 --> 05:03.663
Look, it's okay.
I'm like a doctor or a lawyer.

05:03.736 --> 05:06.136
Well, not a lawyer.
But the point is...

05:06.205 --> 05:09.697
you can tell me whateveryou want,
just between the two of us.

05:09.776 --> 05:14.338
My friend Melissa--we work together.
She was having an affair.

05:14.414 --> 05:18.214
Herhusband, Kent,
is abusive, controlling.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.582
The only time she has alone
is at the office.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.783
But to sign in guests,
you have to have security clearance, so--

05:24.857 --> 05:28.054
So you did her a favor.

05:30.096 --> 05:33.862
Her boyfriend stole files...

05:33.933 --> 05:37.096
took photos of them together
in the building.

05:37.170 --> 05:41.800
I'm the one who signed him in.
I could lose my clearance, myjob, go to jail even.

05:41.874 --> 05:45.002
- He's blackmailing us.
- What does this guywant from you?

05:45.078 --> 05:48.309
I have to sign forpackages,
and Melissa smuggles them out.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.407
Any idea what's in
these packages?

05:51.484 --> 05:55.750
They're from a subsidiary of S.X.G. in Turkey.

05:55.822 --> 05:58.620
I checked one.
It's-- It's drugs.

05:58.691 --> 06:02.821
- I don't know what kind.
- Well, that part ofthe world, it's probably heroin.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.332
There's another one
coming in this week.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.767
- I just want to get out.
- I'll see what I can do.

God only knows. [ Chuckles ]

put it behind me.

Okay. Dave--

06:33.493 --> 06:36.189

met this Dave at a bar.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.321

06:38.398 --> 06:40.662

Come on, please. You have to go.

06:44.170 --> 06:47.230
Okay. You know how
to get ahold of me.

06:49.308 --> 06:53.540
Don't worry about it.
We'll just fill in the blanks ourselves, I guess.

06:53.613 --> 06:58.448
Now, listen, when was the first time Melissa
ever talked about her new friend Dave?

07:01.020 --> 07:03.716
Mom? I got here as fast as I could.
What's the problem?

07:03.790 --> 07:06.122
I got a phone call, Michael.
I was scared.

07:06.192 --> 07:09.161
- Phone call? What kind of phone call?
- It was foryou. Some man.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.958
He wouldn't leave his name
or his number-- nothing.

07:12.031 --> 07:15.899
All he said was, "Van Buren Avenue,"
and then he hangs up.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.801
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, it was probablyjust a friend.

07:18.871 --> 07:22.398
That isn't how friends behave, Michael.
All right?

07:22.475 --> 07:24.409

Hey, Nate. You look clean.
You shaved the ferret offyour face.

07:48.668 --> 07:52.536
So what couldn't wait, Ma?
I had to walk out on a really big investor.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.266
What doyou mean by investor?

07:54.340 --> 07:57.776
Yeah, a buddyofmine, he's got a process
that recycles titanium golfclubs.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.608
It's gonna totally
revolutionize the golfclub--

08:00.680 --> 08:03.547
- Forget it.
- Mom, why did you call Nate?

08:03.616 --> 08:06.016
I called your brother too
because I was scared.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.053
What's goin' on here?

08:08.120 --> 08:10.281
A strange man phoned here.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.018

because it's all a big mystery.

It's just better ifl don't get into it.
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

in some country that I've never even heard of.

I need some backup.

on this whole Cowan business. So I thought--

And one ofthe victims got spooked,
so she's not saying where she met the bad guy.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.395
But I think I got enough
to put it together.

She met him out at a bar,
and I have an approximate date.

10:11.077 --> 10:14.513
- That's not much to go on.
- I got a guywho's pulling
her credit card statement.

find the bar, find the guy.

It was so much fun, Michael.
I wishyou could have been there.

hired to show a prearranged sign
and deliver a message.

11:13.606 --> 11:18.236

but hard to miss.

- Pros use it all the time.
- So what do we do?

15:10.042 --> 15:13.534

get some evidence linking him to the heroin...

that the investigation's stalled.

with Cowan goin'?

15:51.179 --> 15:54.740

- Wow.

Cowan gets the gold star
for clever, doesn't he?

16:11.066 --> 16:14.194
- Or he just likes watching
me run around in this heat.
- Want me to come with you?

16:14.269 --> 16:17.761

a little alone time with me.

his business, open his horizons a little bit.
