00:14.580 --> 00:15.581
Over here!

00:16.957 --> 00:18.543
- Yeah!
- All right!

00:18.626 --> 00:22.129
Gotta hand it to you, Tris.
Mandatory intramurals are a slam dunk.

00:22.212 --> 00:24.131
- Everyone seems to love 'em!
- Come on, guys!

00:24.214 --> 00:25.883
Only 30 more seconds.

00:25.966 --> 00:27.843
We might get through this
whole game without playing once.

00:27.927 --> 00:30.179
Your no-eye-contact plan is genius.

00:30.262 --> 00:31.972
Safety totally maximized.

00:32.055 --> 00:33.057
Hey!

00:37.478 --> 00:38.813
Nerd down. Someone help him off.

00:38.896 --> 00:40.355
Are you okay?

00:40.440 --> 00:44.401
Is it broken? Do I need surgery?

00:44.485 --> 00:47.362
- Hunter, you're in.
- I'm... I'm helping Vijay off.

00:47.447 --> 00:48.739
Quit stalling.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.584
Over here!

01:02.837 --> 01:04.754
Over here!

01:13.931 --> 01:15.933
Yes!

01:16.016 --> 01:17.685
You are such a noob.

01:17.768 --> 01:20.688
- I scored, numbnuts.
- On your own net.

02:00.728 --> 02:02.104
Ah! Okay...

02:02.187 --> 02:04.064
you need to take lessons from Hunter.

02:04.148 --> 02:05.775
- Oh!
- No, you just...

02:05.858 --> 02:07.693
I just need to shoot
from closer, like this.

02:07.777 --> 02:09.904
- Ooh!
- Hey!

02:09.987 --> 02:12.782
- Mind if I steal your girlfriend?
- Actually, we were in the middle...

02:12.865 --> 02:14.909
- What's up?
- I wrote a bridge to that new song

02:14.992 --> 02:16.160
we were working on last night.

02:16.243 --> 02:18.162
The fingering is gonna blow your mind.

02:18.245 --> 02:19.830
I have to listen to this.

02:20.748 --> 02:22.374
I'll see you later, okay?

02:28.589 --> 02:30.675
She might make music with him...

02:30.758 --> 02:32.968
but she makes sweet music with you.

02:35.513 --> 02:38.307
- I mean sex.
- Yeah, thanks.

02:38.390 --> 02:39.391
But we're not.

02:40.643 --> 02:42.770
- But you have.
- Yeah, once.

02:42.853 --> 02:45.189
I don't know. I keep trying
to talk to her about it, but...

02:45.272 --> 02:46.941
Talking is for boys.

02:47.024 --> 02:48.275
Doing is for boyfriends.

02:48.358 --> 02:51.195
Now, see, is that really necessary?

02:51.278 --> 02:53.864
You know how female harp seals
pick a new mate every year?

02:53.948 --> 02:55.490
Why would I know that?

02:55.575 --> 02:58.744
Before they choose, they have relations
with several potential suitors.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.414
Are you saying that
Maya's sleeping with Jonah?

03:02.497 --> 03:04.667
Not yet.

03:06.293 --> 03:08.462
- But she might...
- You gotta man up.

03:12.049 --> 03:15.260
All right, guys, today we begin one
of Shakespeare's great tragedies...

03:15.344 --> 03:16.679
Hamlet.

03:16.762 --> 03:19.181
Your mom's seriously forgiving
your dad for cheating on her?

03:19.264 --> 03:21.058
Yeah, and for treating me like trash.

03:21.141 --> 03:22.852
What do the twins say?

03:22.935 --> 03:25.187
Hunter's happy, and
Frankie's a 15-year-old girl.

03:25.270 --> 03:28.190
- Well, maybe they think he's changed.
- People don't change.

03:28.983 --> 03:31.526
I missed what Mr. M said
about iambic pentameter.

03:32.361 --> 03:34.488
Complicated way of saying simple things.

03:34.572 --> 03:36.365
The end.

03:37.575 --> 03:39.702
And now my dad's coming over for dinner.

03:39.785 --> 03:40.911
At least he's not moving in.

03:40.995 --> 03:43.623
Yet. One dinner leads to another.

03:43.706 --> 03:45.625
Could you please keep quiet?

03:48.628 --> 03:51.338
The six months he's been gone
have been the best of my life.

03:51.421 --> 03:53.883
Look, just tell your mom
that you're not ready.

03:55.009 --> 03:56.176
Do you mind holding these?

03:57.052 --> 04:00.055
Now, Shakespeare places
emphasis on certain...

04:00.139 --> 04:01.473
Yes, Esme?

04:02.141 --> 04:04.434
- Miles cut my hair!
- Oh, no, I didn't.

04:04.518 --> 04:06.353
Then what are you doing
with those scissors?

04:07.980 --> 04:11.191
Charming, Miles. Detention it is.

04:21.118 --> 04:22.703
I am so hungry.

04:22.787 --> 04:25.122
Why do we have to starve because
Miles is chronically late?

04:25.205 --> 04:28.709
Is it too much to ask for family
dinner with the whole family?

04:29.584 --> 04:32.713
Uh, while we're waiting, do you
think you guys could sign this?

04:32.797 --> 04:34.381
It's so I can get out
of intramural death camp.

04:34.464 --> 04:35.758
He means intramural sports.

04:35.841 --> 04:37.551
Uh, you can't run away
from your problems, Hunter.

04:37.635 --> 04:38.969
They GIFed me.

04:39.053 --> 04:41.931
- What?
- It's getting reposted like crazy.

04:41.955 --> 04:44.784
_

04:46.393 --> 04:48.562
This is... this is what
you're all worked up about?

04:48.646 --> 04:51.190
Let me see. Oh, you look so handsome.

04:51.273 --> 04:53.192
I refuse to be embarrassed again.

04:53.275 --> 04:55.152
Then get your sister to teach
you her killer free throw.

04:55.235 --> 04:58.322
More basketball is literally the
opposite of what I want right now.

04:58.405 --> 05:00.282
Why would I do something
that makes me feel like crap?

05:00.365 --> 05:02.076
You really missed the point of intramurals.

05:02.159 --> 05:03.160
No, I get it.

05:03.243 --> 05:04.536
It's supposed to make
us better at teamwork,

05:04.619 --> 05:06.371
but I already get that
through playing video games.

05:06.455 --> 05:08.415
Okay, well, until there's
intramural video gaming,

05:08.498 --> 05:10.334
you're gonna have to figure something out.

05:29.854 --> 05:32.481
This is your plan? A shopping spree?

05:32.564 --> 05:33.983
Patience, grasshopper.

05:34.066 --> 05:36.151
No soldier enters battle

05:36.235 --> 05:38.070
- without armor.
- Whoa!

05:38.153 --> 05:39.864
Dude! We're in a restaurant, man!

05:41.031 --> 05:42.574
You could've just told me you had condoms.

05:42.657 --> 05:44.576
- All right, all right.
- Why did you get so many?

05:45.160 --> 05:46.245
Pick one.

05:46.996 --> 05:49.123
Okay, um...

05:50.665 --> 05:53.627
You know they slide off if
they're too loose, right?

05:57.506 --> 05:59.216
Good thing I kept the receipt.

05:59.299 --> 06:01.468
Oh, I also got you a bunch of lube.

06:01.551 --> 06:03.428
Okay, why? Why?

06:03.512 --> 06:04.847
We're in a restaurant. People can hear us.

06:04.930 --> 06:07.349
- What? Seemed like the right thing to do.
- Hey, uh... Hey, um...

06:07.432 --> 06:09.143
we're gonna order some fries.

06:09.226 --> 06:10.310
Fries, yeah.

06:11.311 --> 06:12.938
Okay, what about the part

06:13.022 --> 06:15.065
where Maya doesn't even
wanna have sex with me?

06:15.149 --> 06:16.817
Girls wanna be swept off their feet.

06:16.901 --> 06:19.694
- You gotta be more assertive.
- Okay, and what if I do all that,

06:19.779 --> 06:22.782
and she would still
rather do it with Jonah?

06:22.865 --> 06:25.409
Last lesson. Confidence.

06:25.492 --> 06:28.245
'Cause Maya's gonna be nervous,
so you have to say this,

06:28.328 --> 06:31.581
"Baby, I'm the captain of this love cruise.

06:31.665 --> 06:33.083
Hop on board."

06:33.876 --> 06:34.919
What?

06:35.002 --> 06:37.046
- You want this to happen, right?
- Yes.

06:37.129 --> 06:38.422
Then just remember...

06:38.505 --> 06:40.090
she's dating you.

06:40.174 --> 06:42.134
That's gotta be worth something.

06:43.928 --> 06:46.263
You know what? You're right.

06:48.140 --> 06:50.350
Yeah, I'm not so bad.

06:50.434 --> 06:51.518
You know what?

06:52.436 --> 06:53.854
Here goes.

06:54.855 --> 06:55.898
Wish me luck.

07:01.528 --> 07:03.280
You know, I think everyone was happy.

07:03.363 --> 07:04.448
You made them happy.

07:04.531 --> 07:06.283
Thank you. Dinner was perfect.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.828
Almost perfect.

07:08.911 --> 07:11.371
Thank you for gracing
us with your presence.

07:11.455 --> 07:13.874
Yeah, you missed one heck of a pot roast.

07:13.958 --> 07:15.835
Well, I'll be sure to have my
own roast in your honor later.

07:17.419 --> 07:20.630
I know. I know I've let you down...

07:20.714 --> 07:22.842
but I wanna earn back your trust.

07:22.925 --> 07:23.926
I do.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.013
- I, uh, I'm gonna run, okay?
- Okay. Good night.

07:35.604 --> 07:37.857
He wants us to be a happy family again.

07:38.816 --> 07:42.862
Mom... when were we ever a happy family?

07:42.945 --> 07:44.446
Was it when he cheated on you,

07:44.529 --> 07:45.823
or when he used me as his punching bag?

07:45.906 --> 07:48.242
- You always bring up the past.
- That was six months ago.

07:48.325 --> 07:50.035
He's going to therapy.

07:50.119 --> 07:52.037
He's taking anger management classes.

07:52.121 --> 07:54.039
Your brother and sister
gave him a second chance.

07:54.123 --> 07:55.624
- Why can't you?
- Because...

07:55.707 --> 07:58.293
whenever he...

07:58.377 --> 08:00.670
he's around me, Mom... Look, I feel...

08:01.588 --> 08:05.259
- I feel like I can't breathe.
- Okay, okay.

08:07.970 --> 08:10.555
- Just don't let him back, okay?
- I'm not.

08:11.891 --> 08:15.602
- At least, not yet.
- No, not ever. Don't let him back.

08:18.522 --> 08:21.191
I'm planning another family dinner...

08:21.275 --> 08:23.986
and I would love it if you would be there,

08:24.069 --> 08:26.947
so you could see how much he's changed.

08:27.031 --> 08:28.532
Do I have a choice?

08:28.615 --> 08:30.993
Not if you care about our family.

08:48.635 --> 08:51.721
Shouldn't you be studying
equations instead of my face?

08:52.639 --> 08:56.310
Um, actually, I was,
uh, studying your lips.

08:56.393 --> 08:58.812
- Your beautiful, beautiful lips.
- What do you want?

09:00.772 --> 09:02.107
To take a break.

09:03.692 --> 09:07.029
- With you.
- I wish, but...

09:07.112 --> 09:09.949
I spent so much time
working that song with Jonah.

09:10.032 --> 09:11.116
Oh, come on.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.203
Wouldn't you rather take a
ride on this love boat, hmm?

09:19.333 --> 09:22.127
- I really do have to do algebra, though.
- Oh, come on, you can do it later.

09:22.211 --> 09:23.378
I have to do music later.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.505
We can make music now.

09:27.049 --> 09:28.050
Oh, my...

09:33.722 --> 09:36.350
- Okay. Zig.
- But come on!

09:36.433 --> 09:37.601
- Okay, I'm getting off.
- Come on.

09:37.684 --> 09:38.810
No, Maya, come on.

09:38.893 --> 09:40.062
- Let go!
- What?

09:40.145 --> 09:41.563
- It's okay. What?
- Stop.

09:41.646 --> 09:42.856
Stop, Zig!

09:43.607 --> 09:44.774
Stop!

09:44.858 --> 09:46.026
Oh, my God, are you okay?

09:46.110 --> 09:47.194
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:48.195 --> 09:49.738
- Yeah, um...
- I'm just really busy

09:49.821 --> 09:50.864
- and I have a lot to do.
- No, it's okay.

09:50.948 --> 09:52.032
- I mean, you understand, right?
- No, no, no.

09:52.116 --> 09:54.743
I'm, um... I'm just gonna go.

09:55.785 --> 09:57.621
Uh... yeah, okay.

10:16.556 --> 10:17.932
Mr. President, could I have a minute?

10:18.017 --> 10:20.394
- Exactly one.
- Oh, better talk fast.

10:23.938 --> 10:25.899
Forcing people to play sports is stupid

10:25.983 --> 10:27.734
- and it sucks nards.
- Good start.

10:27.817 --> 10:29.111
Let him finish.

10:29.694 --> 10:31.989
We need a gamer club.

10:32.072 --> 10:34.574
It's not a joke. Millions of
people play MOBAs every day.

10:34.658 --> 10:36.743
And MOBAs is a game?

10:36.826 --> 10:39.788
It's... it's a type of game,
multiplayer online battle arena.

10:39.871 --> 10:41.498
Some colleges offer
sports scholarships for it.

10:41.581 --> 10:43.125
Finger quotes around "sports."

10:43.208 --> 10:44.810
It's e-sports.

10:44.866 --> 10:48.672
So you wanna replace sports with
slouching in front of a computer?

10:48.755 --> 10:51.258
I wanna replace getting mocked
with something I'm actually good at!

10:51.341 --> 10:53.218
Hit the gym like a normal person.

10:53.302 --> 10:55.637
You promised to make
Degrassi a place for everyone.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.140
Are you gonna fix it, or are you
gonna keep being a stupid liar?

10:59.183 --> 11:00.392
Minute's up.

11:03.437 --> 11:04.771
Thank you for your time.

11:11.486 --> 11:14.239
So, how'd it go?

11:15.449 --> 11:18.702
- Operation Get Some was a total bust.
- What?

11:18.785 --> 11:20.912
I don't know, man. I tried
to be assertive, but...

11:21.830 --> 11:23.540
I think Maya might be done with me.

11:24.791 --> 11:27.252
Or maybe she doesn't want to be raped.

11:27.336 --> 11:28.712
- Whoa!
- Whoa! What?

11:28.795 --> 11:29.838
Nobody did that!

11:29.921 --> 11:31.840
What do you call forcing
someone to have sex?

11:31.923 --> 11:34.468
- Grace, she's my girlfriend.
- That doesn't make it not rape.

11:34.551 --> 11:37.179
Will you stop using the R-word, please?

11:37.262 --> 11:39.223
This wasn't their first time, Grace.

11:39.306 --> 11:41.891
And so what? Bone her once and
suddenly you get an all-access pass?

11:41.975 --> 11:43.852
So he's supposed to ask
for every little thing?

11:43.935 --> 11:46.062
Yeah, idiot. That's how consent works.

11:47.772 --> 11:48.982
You know, that thing
you're supposed to get,

11:49.065 --> 11:51.568
before you climb on top of
some poor, unsuspecting girl?

11:51.651 --> 11:52.861
Mood killer.

11:53.695 --> 11:55.239
I'm about to be a serial killer.

11:55.322 --> 11:56.781
He was just trying to score a home run.

11:56.865 --> 11:59.784
So Maya's like... the opposing team?

11:59.868 --> 12:02.954
Okay, Grace, I didn't
do anything wrong, okay?

12:03.788 --> 12:06.125
I just don't want Maya to break up with me.

12:10.091 --> 12:12.091
_

12:12.330 --> 12:14.457
Funny how things work out, huh?

12:21.223 --> 12:22.974
My mom thinks I'm a bad guy.

12:23.057 --> 12:25.144
Yeah, my mom thinks I'm a bad cook.

12:26.186 --> 12:27.979
Sorry, your problem's bigger.

12:30.274 --> 12:32.234
No, my problem's standing over there.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.573
Oh! You came to thank me.

12:38.657 --> 12:40.242
- How sweet.
- Thank you? For what?

12:40.325 --> 12:42.577
For getting you out of that
dinner you were complaining about.

12:42.661 --> 12:44.037
With a detention.

12:44.954 --> 12:47.666
I believe in solving problems,
not whining about them.

12:47.749 --> 12:49.042
Don't act like you did me a favor.

12:49.125 --> 12:52.379
You're the only one who thinks
your dad isn't to be trusted,

12:52.462 --> 12:53.505
so find proof.

12:54.548 --> 12:57.301
- Yeah, because it's that easy.
- Criminals get careless.

12:57.384 --> 12:59.511
If your dad's a bad guy, there's evidence.

12:59.594 --> 13:03.097
So, what's your brilliant plan?
Break into Mr. H's apartment?

13:03.182 --> 13:04.266
Of course not.

13:06.893 --> 13:09.604
But, I assume his son can get a key.

13:17.153 --> 13:18.238
Break my finger.

13:18.322 --> 13:19.948
- Said no one, ever.
- They can't force me

13:20.031 --> 13:21.074
to do intramurals with a broken bone.

13:21.157 --> 13:22.992
But that's your hand. How will you game?

13:23.076 --> 13:24.411
That's tomorrow-Hunter's problem.

13:24.494 --> 13:26.663
So, the gamer club's a no-go?

13:26.746 --> 13:29.916
Tristan's never heard of MOBAs.
He didn't take me seriously.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.422
Are you sure about this?

13:35.505 --> 13:37.966
One day, losers like Tristan
and ZoÃ« will be working for me.

13:38.049 --> 13:39.468
But...

13:39.551 --> 13:41.052
right now, this is the only way.

13:42.637 --> 13:44.639
Should I get a pencil to bite on before...

13:54.524 --> 13:57.236
Okay, look, I know why you
called me here, and I just...

13:57.902 --> 14:00.154
Zig, I'm glad you're here.

14:00.239 --> 14:02.699
My mom wants to talk to us.

14:02.782 --> 14:05.785
Now will you please tell
me what this is about?

14:05.869 --> 14:08.330
Okay. Um...

14:09.706 --> 14:11.250
Here goes. So...

14:11.333 --> 14:13.752
I know I can't stop you from having sex.

14:13.835 --> 14:16.296
Whoa, Mom, we're not having sex, okay?

14:17.005 --> 14:19.508
Then why did I find these?

14:19.591 --> 14:21.175
I don't know. Those aren't ours.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.761
I have no idea where those came from.

14:22.844 --> 14:24.304
- Tell her, Zig.
- Uh...

14:25.430 --> 14:26.515
Oh, my God.

14:26.598 --> 14:29.268
- Seriously?
- Well, I wanted to be prepared.

14:30.227 --> 14:33.104
You two need to be on the same page.

14:33.187 --> 14:34.773
So take birth control, for example.

14:34.856 --> 14:36.733
I mean, these are...
these are great, but...

14:36.816 --> 14:39.193
Zig, did you know that
Maya is not on the pill?

14:39.278 --> 14:42.989
- Mom! Ugh!
- Um, no. No, I didn't.

14:43.072 --> 14:45.784
What about STIs? When was the
last time that you were tested?

14:46.743 --> 14:47.744
Never.

14:48.745 --> 14:49.829
What do you mean "never"?

14:50.955 --> 14:53.207
Well, I've only had sex with you, Maya.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.335
So you two have had sex.

14:56.044 --> 14:58.422
Oh, God.

14:58.505 --> 15:00.882
Look, you don't need to tell me.

15:00.965 --> 15:03.260
But if you two can't even talk about sex,

15:03.343 --> 15:05.136
should you really be doing it?

15:15.397 --> 15:18.608
Nice place.

15:18.692 --> 15:22.028
- Maybe this is a bad idea.
- It's slightly too late for that.

15:26.283 --> 15:27.784
Why are you even helping me?

15:27.867 --> 15:30.579
I'm new here. I need friends.

15:30.662 --> 15:34.040
And I know what it's like to have
someone in your life you'd rather not.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.419
Where's his computer?

15:37.502 --> 15:39.921
I don't know. I've never
been in my dad's condo before.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.262
Even if we find his
computer, how will we get in?

15:49.180 --> 15:50.849
- Found it.
- Oh, okay.

15:50.932 --> 15:52.851
Well, I've tried all the
usual passwords before.

15:52.934 --> 15:54.644
- Family pet...
- What's your middle name?

15:55.812 --> 15:58.315
David, but I really doubt that's it.

15:59.190 --> 16:01.693
I'm in. Old people are dumb.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.117
Okay, here's an email to Andrea.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.078
This is the woman that my
dad was having an affair with.

16:15.415 --> 16:18.710
He asks her to stay away from
him, so he can fix things at home.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.965
I thought you said your dad
was in a transit meeting.

16:25.925 --> 16:27.677
There.

16:37.646 --> 16:39.272
We're gonna get caught
by the cleaning lady.

16:39.356 --> 16:40.607
Shut up. You are so bad at crimes.

16:40.690 --> 16:43.192
My mom's gonna blame me for this,
like she does for everything else...

16:45.487 --> 16:48.322
My dad will probably be moved
back in by the end of the weekend.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.244
Esme, what are you doing?

16:53.327 --> 16:54.621
Like I said...

16:55.664 --> 16:57.248
I need friends.

17:04.964 --> 17:07.258
And then here, we could cut the reverb.

17:07.340 --> 17:09.511
Mmm-hmm. We could even have
like, a... an ambient tone...

17:09.594 --> 17:12.556
- Yeah, we could.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.480
Can we talk?

17:21.481 --> 17:22.982
Okay, uh, why don't you just...

17:23.066 --> 17:25.527
- Yeah.
- ...text me when you're done with this.

17:32.701 --> 17:35.954
- Dumping me would be a huge mistake.
- What is going on with you?

17:41.084 --> 17:42.669
Did you stop loving me?

17:42.752 --> 17:44.421
Of course I love you.

17:45.755 --> 17:49.634
I can love you and not wanna... you know...

17:49.718 --> 17:51.845
How can you want to and then not want to?

17:51.928 --> 17:53.763
Who says I don't want to?

17:53.847 --> 17:55.974
Sometimes at night, when I think of you...

17:56.683 --> 17:58.226
I just wanna...

17:59.769 --> 18:02.021
I'm really worried it's
gonna be weird again.

18:02.105 --> 18:04.441
Well, if we're not doing it, doesn't
that mean we're gonna break up?

18:04.524 --> 18:05.984
Why would it...

18:07.193 --> 18:09.195
Are you gonna break up with
me if we don't have sex?

18:09.278 --> 18:11.197
- No, no! Of course not.
- Then why would you think that?

18:11.280 --> 18:14.408
Because every time I try to
bring it up, you make excuses.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.703
Because I'm... I'm scared, Zig!

18:16.786 --> 18:18.913
What if I say yes, and
then I change my mind?

18:18.997 --> 18:20.582
Then we'll stop.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.753
I never wanna feel like I'm forcing you.

18:28.214 --> 18:31.217
So we should just keep talking?

18:33.052 --> 18:35.388
Yeah, it sounds like somewhere to start.

18:42.228 --> 18:45.189
- Did it hurt?
- He definitely cried like it hurt.

18:45.273 --> 18:46.566
Well, no pain, no gain.

18:46.650 --> 18:49.402
So, for two hours of pain, you
got a month off of intramurals?

18:49.486 --> 18:50.737
Sweet ROI.

18:51.279 --> 18:52.321
We need to talk.

18:52.405 --> 18:54.949
Hi, Tristan. I voted for you.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.828
Council discussed your
proposal, and you're right,

18:58.912 --> 19:00.914
sports shouldn't be the
only intramural option.

19:00.997 --> 19:02.916
- You're messing with me.
- Of course not.

19:02.999 --> 19:05.209
Congratulations, gamer club is approved.

19:05.293 --> 19:07.712
No one's ever taken my
ideas seriously before.

19:07.796 --> 19:11.550
Well, I can't imagine why.

19:11.633 --> 19:13.384
Dude, you did it.

19:13.467 --> 19:14.761
We got our own team.

19:16.387 --> 19:18.306
- Ah!
- If you make the cut.

19:21.601 --> 19:24.478
- Wait, so you guys made out?
- Listen, you're missing the point.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.732
That email, was it real? Can my dad change?

19:27.816 --> 19:30.068
Those are, um, tough questions.

19:30.151 --> 19:31.903
Um...

19:31.986 --> 19:33.154
how far did you guys go?

19:33.697 --> 19:35.657
You're obsessed, okay?

19:35.740 --> 19:36.741
Why aren't you?

19:36.825 --> 19:39.035
I mean, you are so fixated on your dad,

19:39.118 --> 19:41.329
you can't even enjoy a
spontaneous closet make-out.

19:41.412 --> 19:44.040
Tell me how and I'll do it. Anything
to survive this stupid dinner.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.918
I don't know, man. Just... let go.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.755
- How're you holding up?
- Hi, Esme!

19:50.839 --> 19:53.216
Maybe we can grab a coffee sometime.

19:53.299 --> 19:55.594
Or, uh... commit a sexy felony.

19:58.137 --> 19:59.556
Yeah.

20:00.890 --> 20:02.350
You told him we made out?

20:04.102 --> 20:07.271
What's a girl gotta do to
put a smile on your face?

20:07.355 --> 20:09.273
Convince my mom to dump my dad.

20:09.357 --> 20:12.193
There are always going to be
people in your life who upset you.

20:15.572 --> 20:17.949
So, I just get to feel
like crap forever, then?

20:18.032 --> 20:19.951
Don't give them that power.

20:20.034 --> 20:22.245
Find a way to control your feelings.

20:23.287 --> 20:25.665
Here are my happy pills.

20:25.749 --> 20:28.585
Mom's waiting in the car.
Don't wanna be late for Dad.

20:28.668 --> 20:30.086
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

20:31.504 --> 20:33.882
Take two and call me in the morning.

20:33.965 --> 20:35.466
Or don't. Whatever.

20:57.155 --> 21:00.617
I just wrote a chord progression
into my English essay.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.953
My brain is officially fried.

21:06.915 --> 21:09.500
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:11.628 --> 21:13.129
Could I come sit next to you?

21:15.298 --> 21:16.299
Sure.

21:27.268 --> 21:31.105
Do you want me to, um, close my laptop?

21:31.189 --> 21:32.732
Uh, or I could.

21:34.192 --> 21:36.319
Uh, or whatever.

21:43.534 --> 21:47.205
Can I, uh...

21:47.288 --> 21:50.041
- kiss your neck?
- Okay.

22:08.017 --> 22:11.270
May I, uh... remove your shirt?

22:11.354 --> 22:14.691
- Can I remove yours?
- Uh, yes!

22:14.774 --> 22:16.484
I mean, um, sure.

22:27.996 --> 22:30.414
This is, uh, weird, isn't it?

22:30.498 --> 22:32.083
A little, yeah.

22:33.292 --> 22:34.543
Should we stop?

22:36.087 --> 22:37.338
No.

22:45.429 --> 22:47.598
- Oh! Can we just have sex?
- Yes!
