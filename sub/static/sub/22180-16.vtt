00:16.364 --> 00:18.298
Peter, tell me you're
staying for my party.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.134
Daniel, you know, I'd love to,

00:20.135 --> 00:21.434
but I got this meeting with an NGO.

00:21.435 --> 00:23.137
But listen, happy birthday.

00:23.138 --> 00:24.337
Go have fun.

00:24.338 --> 00:25.471
Don't work too hard, my friend.

00:25.472 --> 00:27.806
Never.

00:32.545 --> 00:35.515
So you're heading out for the meeting?

00:35.517 --> 00:38.384
If I get back to town early enough,

00:38.386 --> 00:40.652
you want to have dinner with me?

00:42.622 --> 00:45.124
I always want to have dinner with you.

00:47.695 --> 00:49.695
Now, go do some good.

01:00.707 --> 01:03.243
What the hell are you doing, Pete?

01:09.650 --> 01:12.286
My God.

01:18.525 --> 01:20.593
Right there, right there.

01:20.594 --> 01:22.061
This way!

01:22.063 --> 01:24.097
This way to the stairwell!

01:24.099 --> 01:25.365
This way.

01:25.367 --> 01:27.233
Go to the stairwell and go down.

01:27.234 --> 01:29.903
Go to the stairwell and
go down. Right there.

01:29.905 --> 01:31.871
Find the stairwell and go down.

01:31.873 --> 01:33.373
Hello?

01:33.375 --> 01:34.540
Help!

01:34.542 --> 01:35.742
Peter?

01:35.743 --> 01:36.810
Daniel.

01:36.811 --> 01:37.977
II cannot see.

01:37.978 --> 01:39.280
- It's okay.
- I cannot see.

01:39.281 --> 01:40.713
It's okay, I got you. Come on.

01:40.715 --> 01:41.981
Let's go to the stairwell.

01:41.983 --> 01:44.384
Okay? Marine.

01:44.385 --> 01:45.585
Take this man downstairs.

01:45.587 --> 01:47.086
His name's Daniel, he can't see.

01:47.087 --> 01:48.322
Come on, Daniel. We got you.

01:48.323 --> 01:49.757
Come on. We got you.

01:49.758 --> 01:52.692
Lana?

01:54.795 --> 01:56.695
Lana?

01:59.633 --> 02:01.567
Lana?

02:01.569 --> 02:04.637
Lana...

02:04.638 --> 02:06.471
Don't go.

02:08.907 --> 02:10.443
Lana.

02:13.348 --> 02:16.032
Okay, Madam Secretary,
you'll give some brief remarks,

02:16.033 --> 02:18.152
followed by a reading of the
names of all the victims,

02:18.153 --> 02:21.055
and then, there will be
a moment of silence.

02:21.056 --> 02:22.675
And then anyone who
wants to will adjourn

02:22.676 --> 02:24.512
to the conference room
for a small reception.

02:24.513 --> 02:26.280
Why "small"?

02:26.281 --> 02:27.680
And "brief"?

02:27.681 --> 02:28.983
Ma'am?

02:28.984 --> 02:31.384
We're commemorating
the 20th anniversary

02:31.385 --> 02:35.188
of an attack that took the
lives of 32 Americans,

02:35.189 --> 02:37.525
56 Ugandans, injuring hundreds more.

02:37.526 --> 02:40.093
Seems like it's worthy of reflection.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.694
What's with all the minimizing?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.062
Well, we generally

02:43.063 --> 02:46.299
try to avoid highlighting
any intelligence failures.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.569
Particularly when it comes
to AIQaeda and bin Laden.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.438
I'm not looking for a parade here.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.406
But not properly acknowledging

02:53.408 --> 02:57.210
the loss to the department,
to the families?

02:57.211 --> 02:58.378
That makes us look bad.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.079
Understood, ma'am.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.716
So the... the reading of the names,

03:03.717 --> 03:05.652
that'll include the
Ugandans, too, right?

03:05.653 --> 03:08.222
The 26 Foreign Service Nationals

03:08.223 --> 03:10.290
who worked at the embassy, yes, ma'am.

03:10.292 --> 03:12.359
What about the rest of them?

03:12.360 --> 03:15.895
The 18 children crowded around
the gate to their school

03:15.896 --> 03:18.431
down the block from where
the bomb went off?

03:18.432 --> 03:21.201
Their teachers?

03:21.203 --> 03:24.237
The four nuns on their way
to work at the AIDS hospice?

03:24.239 --> 03:26.272
We don'twe don't have time to
say their names aloud, too?

03:26.274 --> 03:27.740
Of course we do, ma'am.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.141
Damn right, we do.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.645
Ma'am, there are, actually,
a couple of issues

03:32.646 --> 03:34.647
somewhat related to the anniversary.

03:34.649 --> 03:37.317
First, the White House is asking
us to expedite our review

03:37.319 --> 03:39.085
of the sanctions regime on Sudan.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.421
Didn't we sanction them
precisely because they harbored

03:41.423 --> 03:43.490
terrorists responsible
for the Uganda bombing?

03:43.491 --> 03:45.225
Well, that,
and the occasional genocide

03:45.227 --> 03:46.426
against their own people.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.962
The thinking is they've
cleaned up their act.

03:48.963 --> 03:52.465
On the terrorism front, anyway.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.835
So maybe 20 years is long enough.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.038
But what's the rush about?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.306
Doing my best to find out, ma'am.

04:00.307 --> 04:03.644
Good. Meantime,
gather the relevant folks

04:03.645 --> 04:07.847
within the department, get me
a recommendation, will you?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.049
Have fun with Peter Harriman.

04:09.050 --> 04:10.484
Yeah, lucky me.

04:10.485 --> 04:11.852
Last item...
and you won't believe it...

04:11.853 --> 04:14.153
Congress is once again making
noise about cutting our budget

04:14.155 --> 04:15.256
for embassy security.

04:15.257 --> 04:16.689
I can believe it.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.257
The usual pleading and guilttripping

04:18.259 --> 04:19.791
didn't move the needle?

04:20.827 --> 04:23.930
Well, if anyone has an
outofthebox idea

04:23.932 --> 04:28.369
to convince Congress to keep our
diplomats alive, I'm all ears.

04:28.370 --> 04:29.869
That'll be all. Thank you.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.504
Ma'am.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.042
Ma'am, do you want me to
scale up the memorial?

04:36.043 --> 04:38.378
As long as all the names are read,

04:38.379 --> 04:40.680
that should be fine.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.816
I was having a moment.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.285
Apologies.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.653
Is everything all right?

04:46.654 --> 04:52.292
Listen, um, about
Special Envoy Harriman.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.561
I know he can be a pain.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.896
Go easy today, will you?

04:56.898 --> 04:58.999
He survived the bombing in '98.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.667
I wasn't aware.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.735
I'll do that. Thank you, ma'am.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.138
Yep.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.839
Let's sum up pros and cons

05:06.841 --> 05:08.408
and move to a recommendation
for the secretary.

05:08.410 --> 05:09.542
Pete, you have a question.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.345
What's really going on here, Jay?

05:11.346 --> 05:14.213
Why is the White House so hot to
lift sanctions all of a sudden?

05:14.214 --> 05:15.515
It's a great question.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.285
And one that the secretary
also wants an answer to.

05:18.286 --> 05:19.519
Something stinks.

05:19.521 --> 05:20.853
Is there some sort of
Pentagon play afoot here?

05:20.855 --> 05:22.055
Like I said, we're into it.

05:22.057 --> 05:24.390
Kat, why don't you
sum up the arguments

05:24.391 --> 05:26.559
- in favor of lifting the sanctions?
- Right.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.028
So the idea is that Sudan has
basically done what we demanded,

05:29.029 --> 05:30.563
they've stopped
supporting terrorism,

05:30.564 --> 05:32.465
as far as we know, they are

05:32.466 --> 05:34.367
allowing more food aid to
reach vulnerable populations.

05:34.369 --> 05:35.869
They are no longer

05:35.870 --> 05:38.037
stoking the civil war in South Sudan.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.840
So in short, the chief argument

05:39.841 --> 05:41.674
for lifting the sanctions
is that they worked.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.809
Okay, thanks. Now the cons?

05:42.810 --> 05:44.544
Why should the sanctions
remain in place? Pete?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.045
For exactly the same reason.

05:46.047 --> 05:48.448
President Qasim didn't just
stop supporting AIQaeda

05:48.449 --> 05:49.782
out of the goodness of his heart.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.818
He did it because we hit his regime

05:51.819 --> 05:54.387
and his cronies and his
family where it hurt.

05:54.389 --> 05:56.556
The sanctions are the
only meaningful tool

05:56.557 --> 05:58.992
that we have to affect his behavior.

05:58.994 --> 06:00.160
It's just too soon.

06:00.161 --> 06:01.928
What about the counterargument
that the sanctions

06:01.930 --> 06:03.663
aren't really hurting the regime,

06:03.665 --> 06:05.665
but just trickling down
to the Sudanese people?

06:05.666 --> 06:07.900
Yes, Qasim and his friends have

06:07.901 --> 06:10.103
managed to evade the worst impacts,

06:10.105 --> 06:12.372
but they've felt the bite
enough to come this far.

06:12.374 --> 06:14.374
In the long run, are we
preventing more suffering

06:14.375 --> 06:15.842
than we're causing? I say we are.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.411
President Qasim is not a young man.

06:18.413 --> 06:22.015
We could use the prospect
of lifting the sanctions

06:22.016 --> 06:25.585
as a carrot to try to affect
their choice of his successor,

06:25.586 --> 06:27.453
and how he behaves.

06:27.454 --> 06:30.323
So in my view, we keep
our boot on his neck

06:30.324 --> 06:32.058
until this bastard is dead.

06:32.060 --> 06:34.060
So our recommendation

06:34.062 --> 06:37.262
is that we keep the
sanctions in place?

06:40.334 --> 06:42.168
Okay. Great. Thanks, everybody.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.203
Look who's here.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.438
- Hey, babe. Ready for lunch?
- Hey, honey.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.740
Yeah..

06:47.742 --> 06:49.643
Um, Henry and I are gonna go eat

06:49.644 --> 06:51.277
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

06:51.278 --> 06:53.346
in the freezing cold park.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.550
This is what passes for a
date night these days.

06:57.552 --> 06:58.985
Yeah. Don't wait up for us.

07:00.088 --> 07:01.154
Thank you.

07:01.156 --> 07:02.221
Hey, Doc.

07:02.223 --> 07:03.823
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.559
I think we may have found a way

07:05.560 --> 07:06.859
to, cut through the noise

07:06.860 --> 07:08.361
on the embassy security funding issue.

07:08.362 --> 07:09.662
Don't oversell it.

07:09.663 --> 07:13.833
Congress wants to cut our budget
for embassy security, again.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.636
Unbelievable. But believable.

07:15.637 --> 07:18.237
Look, whatever you're selling,
sell it to me on the walk, okay?

07:18.238 --> 07:20.239
Yes, ma'am. Three words:

07:20.240 --> 07:21.974
Bombsniffing dogs.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.576
To adequately protect our facilities

07:23.577 --> 07:24.944
and personnel worldwide,

07:24.946 --> 07:27.146
State needs to add at least
30 more in the upcoming year.

07:27.148 --> 07:30.850
Yeah, but every other agency
and local PD wants them,

07:30.851 --> 07:32.518
which makes them expensive.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.987
So what's your pitch?

07:34.988 --> 07:37.256
We make a video with you
and a bombsniffing dog.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.893
Highlighting how much State
depends on the work they do,

07:39.894 --> 07:42.328
and implicitly, how Congress
is putting our folks in danger

07:42.329 --> 07:44.497
by cutting our funding
so we can't afford them.

07:44.499 --> 07:48.668
But because it's a dog video,
it's adorable, so it goes viral,

07:48.670 --> 07:51.071
and all of a sudden, there's
outside pressure on Congress.

07:51.072 --> 07:52.505
Better be a pretty cute dog.

07:52.507 --> 07:53.773
So, what do you think?

07:53.774 --> 07:54.974
It's the best idea

07:54.975 --> 07:57.076
- I've heard today.
- Maybe we should get a dog.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.412
Now look what you've started.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.414
Just save one.
- All right, get into it and get back to me.

08:01.415 --> 08:03.983
- Yes, ma'am.
- Will do, ma'am.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.821
You don't have to do this.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.690
What, freeze my ass off
on a park bench with you?

08:10.692 --> 08:11.858
There's nothing I'd rather be doing.

08:11.860 --> 08:13.494
Hold my hand through this week.

08:13.495 --> 08:16.661
I refer to my earlier statement.

08:19.399 --> 08:23.336
I snapped at my staff
about the memorial.

08:23.338 --> 08:24.903
Well, they'll get over it.

08:25.872 --> 08:29.776
Maybe I should put a
letter in a time capsule.

08:29.778 --> 08:31.878
"So, hey,

08:31.879 --> 08:36.716
"my involvement with the Bin
Laden Issue Station at CIA

08:36.717 --> 08:39.285
"has finally been
declassified, so here's.

08:39.287 --> 08:40.787
Why I was such a bitch."

08:40.788 --> 08:42.955
You were a midlevel
analyst, Elizabeth.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.057
You couldn't have
stopped that bombing.

08:47.760 --> 08:51.898
After the first World Trade
Center attack in '93,

08:51.899 --> 08:55.301
we knew it was just a matter of time

08:55.302 --> 08:57.270
before they hit us again.

08:57.272 --> 08:59.505
All those plotters are either dead,

08:59.506 --> 09:03.210
or serving a life
sentence in a supermax.

09:03.211 --> 09:06.946
I always wanted to
apologize, you know?

09:06.947 --> 09:10.551
But I can't.

09:10.552 --> 09:13.419
And to be Secretary of State,
to speak at that memorial,

09:13.421 --> 09:16.155
and not acknowledge my own failure?

09:16.157 --> 09:18.357
Babe, it's...

09:18.359 --> 09:20.226
Henry, it bothers me.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.461
I know.

09:22.462 --> 09:25.231
I'm here.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.333
With lunch.

09:27.335 --> 09:28.501
And dinner tomorrow night.

09:28.503 --> 09:30.003
The kids will be there, too.

09:30.004 --> 09:31.705
So you're just gonna help
me eat my way through this?

09:31.706 --> 09:33.407
Yeah, that's the plan.

09:33.408 --> 09:34.474
Now, come on.

09:34.475 --> 09:36.676
Let's go to the Einstein Memorial.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.412
Old Al always cheers you up.

09:39.413 --> 09:43.816
'Cause he's just like, "Yeah,
I'm just sitting here",

09:43.817 --> 09:47.888
with my three historyaltering
theorems, like, no big deal."

09:47.889 --> 09:49.088
Let's go.

09:49.090 --> 09:51.356
Just am.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.162
Good morning, ma'am.

09:55.163 --> 09:56.596
We need to talk,
before you go in there.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.331
What's up?

09:58.332 --> 09:59.499
You know how CIA's been...

09:59.500 --> 10:00.734
Expanding its relationship

10:00.735 --> 10:01.902
with Sudan the last few years?

10:01.903 --> 10:03.169
- Yeah, what about it?
- Turns out

10:03.171 --> 10:04.604
that they're pretty far down the road

10:04.605 --> 10:08.407
with negotiations to
build a base there.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.009
Are you kidding me?

10:12.678 --> 10:16.482
So that's what's behind the
urgency to lift the sanctions?

10:16.484 --> 10:17.817
That's my bet.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.585
Okay.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.722
Mr. President, II'm sorry,

10:22.724 --> 10:25.558
but II resent my department
being left in the dark

10:25.559 --> 10:27.393
about these negotiations.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.229
But putting that to one side,

10:29.230 --> 10:31.130
is this meeting a foregone conclusion?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.232
Do State's recommendations
even matter?

10:33.234 --> 10:34.667
Of course it does.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.003
Wouldn't be holding the
meeting if it didn't, Bess.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.971
State, remains opposed

10:38.972 --> 10:41.508
to lifting the sanctions?
Yes. For reasons

10:41.509 --> 10:45.077
too numerous, obvious
and odious to mention.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.946
- Sir.
- Madam Secretary,

10:46.947 --> 10:48.881
I understand your frustration.

10:48.883 --> 10:51.984
But the rapidly evolving
terrorist threat in Africa

10:51.985 --> 10:55.489
was such that CIA needed to move
just as quickly to thwart it.

10:55.490 --> 10:58.292
By cozying up to an oppressive regime?

10:58.293 --> 10:59.558
That's how we wound up

10:59.559 --> 11:01.193
with a terrorist threat
in the first place.

11:01.195 --> 11:03.129
I hear you. But we have to fight

11:03.130 --> 11:04.730
today's battle, not yesterday's.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.899
I agree, sir.
But the fact that Qasim has

11:06.900 --> 11:10.836
pitted our government against
itself is warning enough

11:10.837 --> 11:14.474
that he is not a trustworthy
ally in that fight.

11:14.475 --> 11:16.876
What's Treasury's view on this?

11:16.878 --> 11:19.345
While the sanctions have
been broadly effective,

11:19.346 --> 11:21.748
Sudan's Ministry of Finance has,
in recent years, become

11:21.749 --> 11:24.551
much more creative in getting
money in and out of the country.

11:24.552 --> 11:25.686
Meaning what?

11:25.687 --> 11:27.086
That's just it; We don't know.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.254
It's dark money, so it's hard

11:28.255 --> 11:29.489
to say where it's going.

11:29.490 --> 11:30.756
It could well just be

11:30.758 --> 11:33.559
the usual money laundering
of a corrupt regime.

11:33.561 --> 11:35.796
Or it could be money marked
for more nefarious purposes.

11:35.797 --> 11:38.698
Procuring more weapons for use
against their own people.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.066
Exactly. Now, look,

11:40.067 --> 11:42.369
Qasim remains a hardline Islamist.

11:42.370 --> 11:46.205
How convinced are we that
he has changed his stripes?

11:46.206 --> 11:49.875
So you think this dark money
could be supporting terrorism?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.378
I think we should certainly find out

11:51.379 --> 11:52.878
before we hand him a blank check.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.614
Sir, the United States doesn't have

11:54.615 --> 11:56.782
a terror problem in Sudan.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.184
We cannot say the same

11:58.186 --> 12:00.653
about any number of its neighbors.

12:00.654 --> 12:03.657
This base is a bulwark against
a real and growing threat.

12:03.658 --> 12:05.490
We must act quickly.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.296
Well, let's see if we can get to
the bottom of Qasim's finances

12:09.297 --> 12:12.666
before we give away the store.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.033
You have three days.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.302
Thank you.

12:29.868 --> 12:31.536
Well, the regime in
Khartoum has always tried

12:31.537 --> 12:34.335
to evade the sanctions,
but, all of us

12:34.336 --> 12:36.629
at the forensic accounting
unit began to notice

12:36.630 --> 12:38.231
an uptick about five years ago.

12:38.232 --> 12:40.167
How are they getting
money out of Sudan?

12:40.168 --> 12:41.268
Sleight of hand.

12:41.269 --> 12:43.436
They disguise the origin
of the transactions

12:43.437 --> 12:45.104
by routing them through several banks

12:45.105 --> 12:46.974
before the money arrives
at its final destination.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.542
So by the time the money
shows up in, say, Paris,

12:49.543 --> 12:50.876
there's no way of telling...

12:50.878 --> 12:52.345
where it came from.
And in Paris, there's usually

12:52.346 --> 12:55.282
some mirror trade set
up by a straw buyer

12:55.283 --> 12:58.652
for exactly the sum
that left Khartoum.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.787
- Convenient.
- Isn't it, though?

13:00.788 --> 13:02.089
And you don't know where
the money goes after that?

13:02.090 --> 13:03.256
No, at that point, it's clean.

13:03.258 --> 13:05.157
So it becomes very hard to track.

13:05.158 --> 13:08.227
The sheer volume and complexity
of these transactions

13:08.229 --> 13:10.397
makes it impossible to
trace them all end to end.

13:10.398 --> 13:14.500
But we have drilled down on a
few just to get a snapshot.

13:14.501 --> 13:16.369
We should have some answers
for you very soon.

13:16.370 --> 13:17.436
Yeah, and what changed

13:17.437 --> 13:19.306
in the last five or so years

13:19.307 --> 13:21.874
that allowed them to up
their game like this?

13:21.875 --> 13:23.542
Unknown at this point, ma'am.
Don't know.

13:23.543 --> 13:25.311
The ministry's kind of a black box.

13:25.312 --> 13:26.912
You deal with these front office guys,

13:26.913 --> 13:29.881
and who knows who
really moves the money?

13:30.951 --> 13:32.585
Get with OFAC at Treasury

13:32.586 --> 13:34.620
and do your best to
find out, will you?

13:34.621 --> 13:36.922
Yes, ma'am.

13:40.527 --> 13:41.961
Madam Secretary.

13:43.330 --> 13:46.566
I believe that lifting the
sanctions on the Qasim regime

13:46.567 --> 13:49.835
is a mistake, morally
and strategically,

13:49.836 --> 13:52.873
and I have to object in the
strongest possible terms.

13:52.874 --> 13:56.243
I understand.

13:56.244 --> 14:00.111
But the president sets policy,
and we execute it.

14:02.149 --> 14:04.450
Understood, ma'am.

14:12.326 --> 14:13.994
That means she just
found the explosives.

14:13.995 --> 14:15.128
Incredible.

14:15.129 --> 14:16.763
How do they find it so fast?

14:16.764 --> 14:18.230
Training.

14:18.231 --> 14:21.167
But having 300 million
scent cells in her nose...

14:21.168 --> 14:24.503
as compared to our measly six
million... doesn't hurt, either.

14:24.504 --> 14:26.239
Wow. Andand why does she sit,

14:26.240 --> 14:27.506
instead, you know,
scratch or something?

14:27.508 --> 14:29.875
What happens when you touch a bomb?

14:29.876 --> 14:30.943
That's a good point.

14:30.945 --> 14:32.712
Anyway, Gage, as we mentioned,

14:32.713 --> 14:35.749
we want to shoot some video of
one of the grown dogs at work,

14:35.750 --> 14:37.817
and then, we want to get some
footage of the secretary

14:37.818 --> 14:39.251
with one of the younger trainees.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.354
Let's look in the kennel.

14:40.355 --> 14:43.523
Okay. Let's go find our hero dog.

14:43.524 --> 14:45.125
He's so cute.

14:49.429 --> 14:50.963
Hi.

14:50.965 --> 14:53.231
Poncho...

14:57.371 --> 14:59.905
Look at this guy.

14:59.907 --> 15:02.042
- Look at this guy.
- Ho...

15:02.043 --> 15:03.676
Yeah.

15:03.677 --> 15:05.544
- How about this one?
- Who, Waffles?

15:05.546 --> 15:07.313
- Yeah.
- Nah, you don't want him.

15:07.315 --> 15:08.547
He's a washout.

15:08.548 --> 15:10.082
- What does that mean?
- He's a good boy.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.385
Sweet, great with the staff.

15:12.386 --> 15:14.287
Unfortunately,
the training's making clear

15:14.288 --> 15:17.124
he's not much of a bomb sniffer.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.158
Not like Patton, here.

15:19.159 --> 15:20.759
Hey, boy.

15:21.927 --> 15:23.763
You're a pupper.

15:23.764 --> 15:26.166
- He's a natural.
- Whoa.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.835
Here, boy...

15:28.836 --> 15:31.071
Looks like we've found our star.

15:31.072 --> 15:33.940
So, whatwhat happens to Waffles?

15:33.941 --> 15:36.275
He'll go up for adoption.

15:36.277 --> 15:39.044
Our washouts make fantastic pets.

15:39.046 --> 15:40.379
Either of you in the market?

15:40.380 --> 15:41.815
Man, I wish I could,

15:41.816 --> 15:44.518
but my building won't allow dogs.

15:44.519 --> 15:46.585
BBut she's been thinking
about getting one.

15:46.586 --> 15:50.086
What? No, actually,
I have a new baby, so...

15:50.197 --> 15:51.629
Up to you.

15:51.630 --> 15:54.899
In any event, if you are
interested, he'll go quickly.

15:54.900 --> 15:55.854
You hear that?

15:55.855 --> 15:56.831
No, thanks.

15:56.832 --> 15:59.033
Although,
he does seem like a good boy.

16:01.269 --> 16:03.604
Okay, Gage, why don'twhy
don't we walk through the shoot?

16:03.605 --> 16:04.772
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:04.773 --> 16:06.039
Hey, pal.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.140
Hey.

16:07.142 --> 16:08.609
Dinner's gonna be about 7:00.

16:08.610 --> 16:12.078
This lasagna's vegetarian, if
you want to ask Piper to join.

16:14.249 --> 16:16.216
No, that's okay.

16:16.217 --> 16:17.918
You don't want to invite her?

16:17.919 --> 16:19.953
No, it's just that I
think it's important

16:19.955 --> 16:22.422
for just the family to
spend some time together.

16:22.423 --> 16:23.857
That's why we've barely
seen you without Piper

16:23.859 --> 16:25.393
in, like, five months.

16:25.394 --> 16:26.726
Yeah. Tell me about it.

16:26.727 --> 16:28.229
WWait, hang on a second.

16:28.230 --> 16:30.730
Wait, what's going on? Are you
guys in a fight, or something?

16:31.365 --> 16:34.301
Well, she wants to be.

16:34.302 --> 16:36.803
I haven't exactly been
texting her back.

16:36.804 --> 16:37.938
Okay, all right, back up for a second.

16:37.940 --> 16:40.273
I mean, the last couple of weeks,

16:40.274 --> 16:42.075
we haven't been able to
get you away from Piper.

16:42.076 --> 16:43.677
Now, what, you're just ghosting her?

16:43.678 --> 16:44.845
That's the thing.

16:44.846 --> 16:45.946
I'm suffocating.

16:45.947 --> 16:47.315
You know? Likelike,

16:47.316 --> 16:49.783
if I just want to hang out with
my friends, she comes along.

16:49.784 --> 16:51.952
And if she goes to the mall,
then, I go along.

16:51.953 --> 16:54.154
If sheif she volunteers
at the homeless shelter,

16:54.155 --> 16:55.956
then, I volunteer at
the homeless shelter.

16:55.957 --> 16:57.457
- I thought you liked volunteering.
- Yeah.

16:57.459 --> 16:59.226
It was a profound experience
in class awakening,

16:59.227 --> 17:00.628
but that's not the point.

17:00.629 --> 17:01.729
Well, look, it sounds to me

17:01.730 --> 17:03.597
like you guys just
need to have a talk,

17:03.599 --> 17:05.333
you know, about stuff like boundaries,

17:05.334 --> 17:07.034
maybe spending some time apart.

17:07.035 --> 17:08.568
All we do is talk. All right?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.136
I've never been more in
touch with my feelings,

17:10.137 --> 17:11.305
and it's exhausting.

17:11.306 --> 17:12.507
And I always feel like...

17:12.508 --> 17:14.241
like I'm just coming
up a little bit short.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.977
Well, get used to that, buddy.

17:15.978 --> 17:18.479
Okay, well,
we've had a good run,

17:18.480 --> 17:20.181
but it... I feel like
it's time to end things.

17:20.182 --> 17:21.647
Hang on. Listen to me.

17:21.650 --> 17:23.383
Piper's been a really
important person to you.

17:23.384 --> 17:24.617
She's been a great friend.

17:24.618 --> 17:26.019
So if you want to end it,

17:26.020 --> 17:28.556
don't you think you owe it
to her, and to yourself,

17:28.557 --> 17:31.358
to have a conversation
about it, facetoface?

17:31.359 --> 17:33.760
That's not really how
kids do stuff anymore.

17:33.761 --> 17:34.895
Well, I don't care

17:34.896 --> 17:37.064
how kids do stuff,
I care how you do stuff.

17:37.065 --> 17:39.633
Okay. Fine.

17:39.634 --> 17:41.969
All right. When are you
gonna talk to her?

17:41.970 --> 17:43.871
Soon. Really soon.

17:43.872 --> 17:46.339
I'm holding you to that.

17:46.340 --> 17:48.875
Madam Secretary,
thanks for taking the time.

17:48.876 --> 17:50.577
Of course. What can I do for you?

17:50.578 --> 17:53.647
I wanted to give you this.

17:53.648 --> 17:55.950
If that's your resignation,
I won't accept it.

17:55.951 --> 17:58.085
I have to insist.

17:58.086 --> 18:00.086
My position has been undermined.

18:00.087 --> 18:01.556
I can't be an effective negotiator

18:01.557 --> 18:04.025
when the regime in Khartoum knows
they can just go around me

18:04.026 --> 18:05.692
and get what they want from CIA.

18:05.693 --> 18:09.931
Look, I'm as unhappy about how
this is playing out as you are.

18:09.932 --> 18:12.432
But you are one of
the ablest diplomats

18:12.433 --> 18:14.634
this department has ever had.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.037
And we need you in the fight.

18:16.038 --> 18:17.137
How am I supposed to fight

18:17.138 --> 18:18.739
when I've been stabbed in the back?

18:18.740 --> 18:21.142
I tell you what.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.911
Let me just hold onto
it for a few days,

18:23.912 --> 18:25.845
and we'll see where
we're at, all right?

18:25.846 --> 18:27.582
That's entirely up to you, ma'am.

18:27.583 --> 18:29.416
Now if you'll excuse me...

18:29.417 --> 18:31.218
Peter.

18:31.219 --> 18:32.853
I know that

18:32.854 --> 18:34.922
this must be a difficult week for you.

18:34.923 --> 18:37.325
My position on Sudan has nothing to do

18:37.326 --> 18:39.326
- with the bombing.
- I know.

18:39.327 --> 18:42.930
If you wanted to speak at
the memorial tomorrow,

18:42.931 --> 18:44.999
the department would be honored.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.768
That's very gracious of you,
ma'am, but no, thank you.

18:48.769 --> 18:50.836
I read the report.

18:52.473 --> 18:55.409
You saved lives that day.

18:55.410 --> 18:59.279
You embodied the very
best of this department.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.949
The very best of humanity,
for that matter.

19:01.950 --> 19:03.183
I was having an affair.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.585
Is that in your report?

19:05.586 --> 19:08.088
She was all those things
that you just talked about.

19:08.089 --> 19:10.056
As were many of my colleagues,

19:10.057 --> 19:13.827
and the innocent, beautiful
children at that school.

19:13.828 --> 19:17.731
And for the life of me,
I can't explain why I am here,

19:17.732 --> 19:20.734
when she is not and they
are not, and so, no.

19:20.736 --> 19:23.837
Thank you very much, but I will
not be speaking at the memorial.

19:23.838 --> 19:25.270
Now if you'll excuse me.

19:29.510 --> 19:32.113
Everything's fine.

19:32.114 --> 19:34.892
It's just a tough week for him.

19:35.651 --> 19:37.684
For a lot of people.

19:37.685 --> 19:39.452
Your motorcade is here to
take you to the White House.

19:39.453 --> 19:40.819
I'll be right out.

19:46.694 --> 19:49.829
Elizabeth. Tom.

19:49.830 --> 19:51.499
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.835
So, I hear we've achieved
clarity on Sudan's finances,

19:54.836 --> 19:57.270
if that's not an oxymoron.

19:57.271 --> 19:58.605
That's correct, sir.

19:58.606 --> 20:00.807
We were able to track some of
the suspicious transactions

20:00.808 --> 20:02.676
from origin to endpoint.

20:02.678 --> 20:04.144
While this isn't a complete picture,

20:04.145 --> 20:05.645
it does give us a fairly good sense

20:05.646 --> 20:07.847
of the overall purpose
of the operation.

20:07.848 --> 20:09.383
And?

20:09.384 --> 20:11.184
Basically, the money winds
up in Swiss bank accounts,

20:11.185 --> 20:14.689
or goes toward the purchase of
luxury real estate in Europe.

20:14.690 --> 20:17.857
President Qasim does appear
to be feathering his nest,

20:17.858 --> 20:22.063
should he ever retire, or be
forced from power, more likely.

20:22.064 --> 20:26.232
So no illicit weapons purchases
or terrorist slush fund?

20:26.233 --> 20:29.903
No, sir. Just the usual dictator
shenanigans, as you suspected.

20:29.904 --> 20:30.970
Yes, but we should add,

20:30.971 --> 20:32.739
we still don't know who's managing

20:32.740 --> 20:34.541
these transactions for him.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.676
That's fairly academic, at this point.

20:36.677 --> 20:38.679
Well, then...

20:38.680 --> 20:41.781
I think we should move forward

20:41.782 --> 20:43.784
with formally lifting the sanctions.

20:43.785 --> 20:46.619
Before you voice them, your
reservations are noted.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.588
And shared, for that matter.

20:48.589 --> 20:50.356
Understood, sir.

20:54.762 --> 20:56.931
Ma'am? A word?

20:56.932 --> 20:58.898
It's urgent.

21:02.604 --> 21:03.837
- Ma'am.
- Hi, Evelyn.

21:03.838 --> 21:04.838
Evelyn and her team

21:04.839 --> 21:06.606
were able to track down the identities

21:06.607 --> 21:08.008
of some of the key players

21:08.009 --> 21:10.478
behind President Qasim's
financial moves.

21:10.479 --> 21:11.644
II appreciate

21:11.645 --> 21:13.146
your dogged professionalism,

21:13.147 --> 21:16.416
but POTUS just moved
to lift the sanctions,

21:16.417 --> 21:18.919
so their identities
aren't germane anymore.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.587
- But thank you.
- With respect, ma'am,

21:20.588 --> 21:23.423
they are.

21:23.424 --> 21:24.858
This is...

21:24.859 --> 21:26.160
Gaafar EIBasha.

21:26.161 --> 21:29.930
The AIQaeda money man behind
the Uganda bombing in '98.

21:29.931 --> 21:31.731
He was killed by a drone
strike eight years ago.

21:31.732 --> 21:34.934
Are you telling me he's alive?

21:34.935 --> 21:36.970
According to our sources,
he's back home in Khartoum

21:36.971 --> 21:39.939
using his financial acumen on
behalf of President Qasim.

21:41.910 --> 21:44.810
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

21:48.476 --> 21:50.752
Mr. President,
Sudan has been harboring

21:50.753 --> 21:52.520
a known terrorist under
our nose for years.

21:52.521 --> 21:55.324
If that isn't violating the
terms of the sanctions,

21:55.325 --> 21:56.924
I don't know what is.

21:56.925 --> 21:58.559
True, but on the other hand,
you yourself said that.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.063
EIBasha isn't engaged in
any terrorist activity.

22:01.064 --> 22:03.996
He's just laundering money
so that President Qasim

22:03.997 --> 22:05.663
can say he owns a château

22:05.664 --> 22:07.031
in the Loire Valley.

22:07.032 --> 22:09.468
So what are we suggesting here?

22:09.469 --> 22:11.036
We just let him go?

22:11.037 --> 22:13.638
Well, it's possible that once
the sanctions are lifted.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.074
Qasim won't need EIBasha anymore

22:15.075 --> 22:16.040
and he'll just hand him over.

22:16.041 --> 22:17.609
Maybe the prospect of them

22:17.611 --> 22:20.311
being reimposed is enough to
get Qasim to cough him up.

22:20.313 --> 22:22.213
Respectfully, sir,

22:22.214 --> 22:24.482
we were all spies once.

22:24.483 --> 22:27.920
EIBasha knows where all of
Qasim's bodies are buried,

22:27.921 --> 22:30.288
at least the financial ones.

22:30.289 --> 22:33.392
Do we really believe that he's
just going to cut him loose?

22:33.393 --> 22:34.794
What do you suggest, Bess?

22:34.795 --> 22:36.528
We slow play lifting the sanctions,

22:36.529 --> 22:38.631
and mount an operation and
grab that son of a bitch.

22:38.632 --> 22:41.032
Excuse my French, Mr. President.

22:41.034 --> 22:43.234
Well, that wouldn't exactly be
the most auspicious beginning

22:43.236 --> 22:45.770
to this new chapter
in our relationship.

22:45.771 --> 22:47.806
Mr. President, our base
plans are very far along.

22:47.807 --> 22:50.476
We've got dozens of CIA
personnel incountry.

22:50.477 --> 22:54.177
Actually, that helps.

22:56.348 --> 22:59.083
So, what did Conrad say?

23:00.854 --> 23:02.654
That he'll think it over.

23:02.655 --> 23:05.156
That's usually the kiss of death.

23:05.157 --> 23:09.127
Tomorrow, I'm going to look
State Department staffers

23:09.128 --> 23:12.263
in the eye and say,
"Times have changed

23:12.265 --> 23:14.900
since the bombing in Uganda."
When in fact,

23:14.901 --> 23:17.335
one of the very terrorists

23:17.336 --> 23:20.538
responsible for the bombing is
cooling his heels in Khartoum,

23:20.539 --> 23:23.107
which makes a damn good case

23:23.108 --> 23:26.845
that nothing has changed at all.

23:26.846 --> 23:28.814
Whole thing makes me sick.

23:28.815 --> 23:30.882
Hey. Come on.

23:32.551 --> 23:35.753
These folks have been
around the block.

23:35.755 --> 23:38.958
They don't expect you to
somehow resolve their grief.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.359
You just need to be
sincerely present for it

23:41.361 --> 23:43.095
and I have no doubt you'll do that.

23:43.096 --> 23:45.364
Much like you are now.

23:45.365 --> 23:47.098
Yes, this is all just
an elaborate ruse

23:47.099 --> 23:48.534
to get you to give me a compliment.

23:48.535 --> 23:50.536
What's going on around here?

23:50.537 --> 23:53.104
What's the latest with PiperGate?

23:53.105 --> 23:56.374
You know, I don't know.
I should check on that.

23:56.375 --> 23:58.643
No, you shouldn't.

23:58.644 --> 23:59.878
You don't think that he
owes her the respect

23:59.880 --> 24:01.814
- to break up with her in person?
- I do.

24:01.815 --> 24:05.950
But I also think kids have to
work this stuff out themselves.

24:05.951 --> 24:09.054
Come on. There's never
been a more important time

24:09.055 --> 24:10.122
for us to insist our son

24:10.123 --> 24:11.356
treat women with respect.

24:11.357 --> 24:13.858
You are preaching to the choir.

24:13.859 --> 24:18.364
But sticking your nose
into teenage romance?

24:18.365 --> 24:20.332
That way lies madness.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.500
True.

24:22.501 --> 24:24.169
But I'm feeling cocky.

24:24.170 --> 24:25.270
I'm gonna go for it.

24:25.271 --> 24:26.672
- Yeah. I'm doing it.
- Henry.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.007
Don't. Don't.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.642
Hey, Jace.

24:29.643 --> 24:30.808
Yeah, what's up?

24:30.809 --> 24:32.377
You talk to Piper yet?

24:32.378 --> 24:35.413
You know, um, it's just
such a sensitive topic.

24:35.414 --> 24:36.882
I'm waiting for the right time.

24:36.883 --> 24:38.284
Yeah.

24:38.285 --> 24:40.085
So in other words,
you're still ghosting her.

24:40.086 --> 24:42.320
Wait, you actually want
to break up with Piper?

24:42.322 --> 24:43.855
Wow, you're an even bigger idiot

24:43.856 --> 24:45.089
- than I thought you were.
- You're an idiot.

24:45.090 --> 24:47.125
All right, let's play
"Who's an Idiot?" later.

24:47.126 --> 24:48.493
Um, get your phone and text Piper.

24:48.494 --> 24:50.395
Tell her you want to talk to
her and then get your shoes.

24:50.396 --> 24:51.329
We're gonna go over there.

24:51.330 --> 24:52.498
- What? No.
- Yup.

24:52.499 --> 24:53.766
Yeah, at least have the balls

24:53.767 --> 24:54.900
to tell her in person.

24:54.901 --> 24:56.434
You go, Dad.

24:56.435 --> 24:59.104
Can't I just call Piper?

24:59.105 --> 25:00.471
Seems like a happy medium.

25:00.472 --> 25:03.107
Jace, just open the door
and go talk to her.

25:03.108 --> 25:04.410
I'll be waiting right here.

25:04.411 --> 25:05.810
Henry.

25:05.811 --> 25:07.112
Jason, hi.

25:07.113 --> 25:08.713
- Piper told me you'd be stopping by.
- Hi.

25:08.714 --> 25:10.516
Hi, Regina.

25:10.517 --> 25:11.883
She's upstairs, Jason.

25:11.884 --> 25:13.518
Do you want to come inside
for a cup of coffee?

25:13.519 --> 25:15.054
I was just dropping Jason off.

25:15.055 --> 25:18.457
Thank God they'll be able
to drive at night soon, right?

25:18.458 --> 25:20.758
Come on. Have some coffee.

25:20.759 --> 25:24.228
Sure.

25:29.068 --> 25:31.368
Hey, Piper.

25:34.406 --> 25:35.673
Hey.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.378
Jason seems so serious tonight.

25:40.380 --> 25:41.980
Yeah?

25:41.981 --> 25:43.614
But, you know, he's a heady kid.

25:43.615 --> 25:44.816
He's thoughtful, mature.

25:44.817 --> 25:47.618
Well, that's great to hear.

25:47.619 --> 25:50.122
Frank and I just adore him.

25:50.123 --> 25:52.391
Elizabeth and I are very
fond of Piper, too.

25:52.392 --> 25:55.661
You know, the four of us should
all have dinner sometime.

25:55.662 --> 25:57.997
I'm... I know the secretary's
probably very busy.

25:57.998 --> 25:59.698
No, no, that'd be great.

25:59.699 --> 26:01.000
Maybe on prom night.

26:02.201 --> 26:03.167
Yeah, parents' prom.

26:03.169 --> 26:06.337
Hey, Dad, so, time to go.

26:06.338 --> 26:07.972
Well, it's great to see
you again, Regina.

26:07.973 --> 26:10.508
Um, can't wait till they
can drive at night?

26:10.509 --> 26:12.676
Byebye now.

26:16.281 --> 26:18.584
In closing,

26:18.585 --> 26:20.952
Abraham Lincoln wrote
of those who perished

26:20.953 --> 26:22.755
in the great struggle of his age,

26:22.756 --> 26:26.290
"that from these honored dead
we take increased devotion

26:26.291 --> 26:27.992
"to that cause for which they gave

26:27.993 --> 26:30.961
the last full measure of devotion."

26:33.032 --> 26:35.800
For our beloved, fallen colleagues,

26:35.801 --> 26:38.604
that cause was and
remains the promotion

26:38.605 --> 26:41.739
of this nation's highest ideals:

26:41.740 --> 26:45.210
Equality, freedom,

26:45.211 --> 26:48.947
justice and democracy.

26:48.948 --> 26:53.786
Let's honor their memory
by humbly continuing

26:53.787 --> 26:56.354
to serve that noble cause.

26:56.355 --> 26:57.989
Thank you.

27:00.926 --> 27:03.560
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

27:05.230 --> 27:09.133
And now we will observe
a moment of silence

27:09.134 --> 27:11.636
before the reading of the names

27:11.637 --> 27:15.374
of all who perished in the attack,

27:15.375 --> 27:18.309
American and Ugandan.

27:18.310 --> 27:21.413
Please bow your heads.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.654
You think MSec

27:29.655 --> 27:31.222
sold the Lincoln quote?

27:31.223 --> 27:33.325
Wait, is that what
you're thinking about?

27:33.326 --> 27:35.259
You mean my job? Yeah.

27:35.260 --> 27:36.494
You know, for someone so talented,

27:36.496 --> 27:37.829
you can be a real weenie.

27:37.830 --> 27:40.231
Ouch. You're lashing out.

27:40.232 --> 27:42.667
That's natural. You know why?

27:42.669 --> 27:44.869
Because Joanna's colicky
and I haven't gotten

27:44.871 --> 27:46.771
four consecutive hours
of sleep in a month?

27:46.772 --> 27:49.474
You're single. You're lonely.

27:49.476 --> 27:52.478
What you need is a loyal,
uncomplicated companion.

27:52.479 --> 27:54.680
I know you're not talking about you.

27:54.681 --> 27:56.914
Again, ouch.

27:56.915 --> 27:58.416
But no, I'm talking about Waffles.

27:58.417 --> 28:00.818
Did you not hear what I just said?

28:00.819 --> 28:02.820
I'm exhausted literally all the time.

28:02.821 --> 28:04.256
I don't have the energy for a dog.

28:04.257 --> 28:05.223
I hear that.

28:05.224 --> 28:06.424
Now hear this.

28:06.425 --> 28:07.893
A dog in the house is proven

28:07.894 --> 28:09.862
to improve your child's immune system.

28:09.863 --> 28:11.063
That's science.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.431
Also, dogs are excellent
deterrents to criminals.

28:13.432 --> 28:14.665
That's very important

28:14.666 --> 28:16.634
- for a single mom.
- Please, keep saying "single."

28:16.635 --> 28:18.470
Which leads me to my last point.

28:18.471 --> 28:22.007
Let's face it. A baby carriage
ain't exactly a man magnet.

28:22.008 --> 28:23.976
I hate you so much.

28:23.977 --> 28:26.077
But you know what is?

28:27.513 --> 28:29.280
You're just playing on
my fear of dying alone

28:29.281 --> 28:31.450
to make me get a dog
that you actually want.

28:31.451 --> 28:33.451
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

28:33.452 --> 28:34.486
Out.

28:34.487 --> 28:35.586
I'd walk him for you.

28:35.587 --> 28:37.722
- Go.
- Come on.

28:37.723 --> 28:40.959
You know, it would mean
a lot to me to know

28:40.960 --> 28:43.961
that you and Joanna had someone
to help keep you safe.

28:43.962 --> 28:47.431
You know, you should've
just opened with that, man.

28:47.432 --> 28:50.601
Weenie.

28:53.506 --> 28:55.574
Ma'am.

28:55.575 --> 28:58.410
We've got Intel on EIBasha.

28:58.411 --> 29:00.176
Okay.

29:03.849 --> 29:06.684
CIA still hasn't nailed down
his exact place of residence

29:06.685 --> 29:08.787
in Khartoum, but there
does appear to be a villa,

29:08.788 --> 29:12.490
under the name of an
otherwise poor relation

29:12.491 --> 29:13.791
in Port Sudan.

29:13.792 --> 29:16.494
Well, at least we've got one
fixed location for him.

29:16.496 --> 29:17.863
That's good.

29:17.864 --> 29:19.064
Nice pool, by the way.

29:19.065 --> 29:20.566
But he's not there now

29:20.567 --> 29:22.467
and the Red Sea's at least a
full day's drive from Khartoum.

29:22.468 --> 29:24.169
So, while the villa's
a nice data point,

29:24.170 --> 29:26.470
there's no telling when he
might actually show up there.

29:29.909 --> 29:32.209
Maybe we should force his hand.

29:38.567 --> 29:40.719
It is a pleasure, Madam Secretary,

29:40.720 --> 29:42.421
to be able to speak to you

29:42.422 --> 29:45.423
with the candor of a friend and equal.

29:45.424 --> 29:48.359
Well, the pleasure is all mine,
Mr. Foreign Minister.

29:48.361 --> 29:53.121
Sudan looks to build on many
shared areas of corporation

29:53.122 --> 29:54.388
and we count the days

29:54.390 --> 29:57.358
until these onerous
sanctions are lifted.

29:57.359 --> 29:59.493
As do we.

29:59.494 --> 30:02.998
Although, we did learn
something of concern recently.

30:02.999 --> 30:04.332
And what is that?

30:04.333 --> 30:06.934
It seems too incredible to be true,

30:06.935 --> 30:10.005
but are you familiar with
the name Gaafar EIBasha?

30:10.006 --> 30:11.940
He was an AIQaeda financier.

30:11.941 --> 30:14.142
I remember the name vaguely.

30:14.143 --> 30:16.544
Um, he was killed some years ago, no?

30:16.545 --> 30:19.647
Well, that's just it.

30:19.648 --> 30:22.916
We have intelligence
that he might be alive.

30:22.917 --> 30:25.653
Well, this is indeed incredible.

30:25.654 --> 30:28.856
Furthermore, he might be hiding
out in his hometown of Khartoum.

30:28.857 --> 30:30.624
But this is impossible.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.993
Where did you hear such a story?

30:32.994 --> 30:35.063
In light of our
burgeoning partnership,

30:35.064 --> 30:37.999
might your government help
in our search for him?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.067
You have my word, Madam Secretary.

30:40.068 --> 30:43.537
If this ghost, EIBasha,
is in Khartoum,

30:43.538 --> 30:45.906
we will certainly find him.

30:45.907 --> 30:49.777
That would mean a great deal to us.

30:49.778 --> 30:51.412
Thank you, Rashad.

30:51.413 --> 30:53.614
Good evening, Elizabeth.

31:00.455 --> 31:02.722
It's done.

31:08.763 --> 31:10.531
Tell me that story again.

31:10.532 --> 31:14.201
Not funny, Elizabeth.

31:14.202 --> 31:15.737
Henry, come on.

31:15.738 --> 31:18.337
I had a really hard day.

31:20.041 --> 31:22.544
So, Jace comes running out,

31:22.545 --> 31:24.578
like, "Go, go, go!"

31:24.579 --> 31:28.816
And then you turn to Regina and say?

31:28.817 --> 31:30.652
"Can't wait till they can
drive at night?"

31:30.653 --> 31:33.253
That just...

31:33.255 --> 31:35.190
- Probably the most...
- Itit's too good.

31:35.191 --> 31:36.458
Awkward moment ever.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.425
III froze. II really bricked.

31:38.426 --> 31:40.961
I told you not to get involved.

31:40.962 --> 31:42.896
I feel bad.

31:42.897 --> 31:44.199
If I want Jason to figure out

31:44.200 --> 31:45.532
how to treat people respectfully,

31:45.534 --> 31:47.501
I should've modeled that.

31:47.502 --> 31:50.872
But II just let that
poor woman prattle on

31:50.873 --> 31:52.306
about spending prom night with us.

31:52.307 --> 31:54.409
- Please. Letlet's not do that.
- No.

31:54.410 --> 31:56.577
- Okay?
- Well, it's moot, anyway.

31:56.578 --> 31:59.480
And then when Jason bailed,
I was just...

31:59.481 --> 32:01.982
"Can you wait till he
can drive at night?

32:01.983 --> 32:03.817
- "Am I right, Regina?"
- All right, all right.

32:03.818 --> 32:06.755
- "Is this thing working? I know I am."
- Stop it.

32:06.756 --> 32:07.922
You know what I'm gonna do?

32:07.923 --> 32:09.356
- What?
- I'm gonna call her,

32:09.357 --> 32:10.991
and apologize and just clear the air.

32:10.992 --> 32:12.594
- Yeah...
- Henry, you are in a hole.

32:12.595 --> 32:13.994
Just quit digging, would you?

32:13.996 --> 32:15.130
Never.

32:15.131 --> 32:16.698
Good night, beautiful.

32:16.699 --> 32:18.332
Good night, handsome.

32:29.878 --> 32:31.445
Not funny.

32:31.446 --> 32:33.515
It is so funny.

32:33.516 --> 32:35.916
Hi, I'm Secretary of
State Elizabeth McCord,

32:35.917 --> 32:37.852
and this is Patton.

32:37.853 --> 32:40.989
He's training for a
very special mission.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.089
There's no denying he's cute.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.092
He's so much more than that.

32:44.093 --> 32:46.027
He's got spirit.
Justjust look into his eyes.

32:46.028 --> 32:47.996
He'll show them all.

32:47.997 --> 32:49.096
It's just not the right time,

32:49.097 --> 32:50.330
andand that's all there is to it.

32:50.332 --> 32:51.365
Fine.

32:51.366 --> 32:52.432
Are you ready, Patton?

32:52.433 --> 32:54.102
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

32:54.103 --> 32:55.769
Patton is a real pro.

32:55.770 --> 32:57.271
Yeah, screw that guy.

32:57.272 --> 32:58.338
And that's a cut.

32:59.508 --> 33:00.842
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

33:00.843 --> 33:02.410
We'll be ready with the next
setup in just a minute.

33:02.411 --> 33:04.645
- Great.
- Cool.

33:04.646 --> 33:07.681
I have got to tell you guys,
this place

33:07.682 --> 33:10.718
is making me rethink my whole
stance on not getting a dog.

33:10.719 --> 33:13.354
My God.

33:13.355 --> 33:16.191
Look at how cute you are.

33:16.192 --> 33:17.592
He's so much more than that, though.

33:17.593 --> 33:19.227
"Waffles,".

33:19.228 --> 33:22.363
Waffles is up for adoption?

33:22.364 --> 33:25.200
My goodness, sweetheart,
do you want to come home with me

33:25.201 --> 33:26.467
and just snugguggugg...

33:26.468 --> 33:27.634
Already spoken for.

33:27.635 --> 33:29.636
- Yes...
- Yeah. I'm adopting him.

33:29.637 --> 33:30.904
Waffles is my dog, okay?

33:30.905 --> 33:32.973
- OOkay.
- It's her dog.

33:32.974 --> 33:35.410
Good. Great, Daisy, that's...

33:35.411 --> 33:36.779
We're ready when you are,

33:36.780 --> 33:38.494
- Madam Secretary.
- Congratul... okay.

33:41.282 --> 33:42.715
Shut up.

33:44.252 --> 33:45.619
You're welcome.

33:45.621 --> 33:48.518
Looks like your plan to get EIBasha

33:48.519 --> 33:50.452
out of Khartoum worked.

33:50.453 --> 33:53.922
Well, we'll see.

33:53.923 --> 33:55.557
Soon enough.

33:55.558 --> 33:56.758
Cheers.

33:56.759 --> 33:59.695
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:59.697 --> 34:01.130
Anyway, thanks for coming.

34:01.131 --> 34:03.098
Lydia thought I could stand
to have some company

34:03.099 --> 34:07.269
while I'm waiting to hear
how this plays out, so...

34:07.270 --> 34:09.438
thanks for being here.

34:13.610 --> 34:15.010
You know, Bess,
I've been thinking about

34:15.012 --> 34:17.312
that bombing in Uganda,
all those years ago.

34:17.313 --> 34:18.880
One of the first shots
in what's turned out

34:18.882 --> 34:21.183
to be a very long fight.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.784
We have children that were
born after that started.

34:23.786 --> 34:26.455
And there's still no
real end in sight.

34:26.456 --> 34:27.656
Well,

34:27.657 --> 34:28.889
we've had many successes.

34:28.891 --> 34:30.958
We've downgraded AIQaeda and ISIL...

34:30.960 --> 34:32.060
And AIShabaab,

34:32.061 --> 34:35.530
and Boko Haram and the rest.

34:35.532 --> 34:41.036
20 years, trillions of dollars,
thousands of American lives.

34:42.672 --> 34:44.339
I've stood on that tarmac at Dover

34:44.340 --> 34:47.609
and saluted more coffins
than I can count.

34:47.610 --> 34:50.646
And are we any closer to victory?

34:50.648 --> 34:52.179
I mean, what would
victory even look like?

34:52.181 --> 34:54.283
- It's a paradox.
- II feel like

34:54.284 --> 34:56.518
I'm failing the American people,
like I'm failing the world,

34:56.518 --> 34:57.886
because I don't have a better answer.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.054
Well, I know going after.

34:59.056 --> 35:00.289
EIBasha is personal to me,

35:00.291 --> 35:05.260
but Conrad, I think this
one is worth the risk.

35:05.262 --> 35:06.996
It always is.

35:08.298 --> 35:09.831
That's the problem, in some ways.

35:09.833 --> 35:11.199
Mr. President.

35:11.201 --> 35:14.168
The SEALs are inside
EIBasha's compound.

35:27.384 --> 35:29.384
What are you doing?

35:29.385 --> 35:31.253
Who are you?

35:31.255 --> 35:34.456
Invictus. Repeat, Invictus.

35:34.458 --> 35:36.725
Invictus, copy.

35:36.726 --> 35:38.994
Proceed to rendezvous for exfil.

35:42.971 --> 35:46.663
Madam Secretary,
Sudan must officially protest

35:46.664 --> 35:48.965
this violation of our sovereignty.

35:48.967 --> 35:50.900
Sure. Why not?

35:50.902 --> 35:55.004
I'm really calling to alert
your government to two items.

35:55.005 --> 35:58.341
Gaafar EIBasha is awaiting
arraignment on terrorism charges

35:58.342 --> 36:00.610
in federal court in the Eastern
District of Virginia...

36:00.612 --> 36:03.980
that's where the preponderance
of his victims used to live,

36:03.981 --> 36:06.817
you see... excluding, of
course, the dozens of Ugandans

36:06.818 --> 36:08.084
who were also murdered that day.

36:08.085 --> 36:10.119
Shall I read you all the names?

36:10.121 --> 36:14.324
We will rescind our approval of
the CIA base in our country.

36:14.326 --> 36:18.695
But the CIA agents in Sudan have
already proven their worth.

36:18.697 --> 36:21.331
In fact, it was their Intel

36:21.333 --> 36:23.900
that brought a notorious
terrorist to justice.

36:23.902 --> 36:25.668
How can the U.S. afford to lose

36:25.670 --> 36:27.804
such an asset?

36:27.806 --> 36:31.341
I'm telling you what you
should say to me next year,

36:31.342 --> 36:33.876
when the U.S. will reconsider
lifting the sanctions.

36:33.878 --> 36:35.346
A year's time?

36:35.347 --> 36:36.846
We had an agreement.

36:36.847 --> 36:37.914
We did.

36:37.916 --> 36:39.515
And we will again,

36:39.516 --> 36:43.753
provided you're transparent
in your dealings with us.

36:43.755 --> 36:46.923
But there's one thing
that you should know,

36:48.659 --> 36:51.861
when it comes to avenging harm

36:51.862 --> 36:54.897
done to our people,

36:54.898 --> 36:58.266
we never forget.

36:59.704 --> 37:01.804
Let me know what you decide
about the base. Bye.

37:01.806 --> 37:03.539
Wait, just a...

37:07.012 --> 37:08.244
Hi, Regina, it's Henry McCord.

37:08.246 --> 37:09.545
How are you?

37:09.547 --> 37:11.314
Good... I'm fine, yeah, I'm fine.

37:11.315 --> 37:13.916
Listen, I wanted to talk
to you about the...

37:13.918 --> 37:15.518
Okay.

37:16.788 --> 37:18.554
Other night, um...

37:18.556 --> 37:20.256
I'm sorry, Regina,
can I call you right back?

37:20.257 --> 37:21.524
Yes. Thanks. Sorry.

37:21.525 --> 37:22.592
Hey, Piper.

37:22.594 --> 37:23.626
Hi, Henry.

37:23.628 --> 37:25.295
Hey. Um, Jace, can I...

37:25.297 --> 37:26.730
talk to you for just one sec?

37:26.731 --> 37:29.233
Yeah. Sure.

37:30.702 --> 37:31.801
What's up, Dad?

37:31.802 --> 37:34.103
You...

37:34.105 --> 37:36.405
Why don't you tell me?

37:37.474 --> 37:40.710
Yeah, um, you were totally right.

37:40.711 --> 37:43.246
You know, just...
after the other night,

37:43.248 --> 37:45.782
II realized that, you know,
I wanted some space,

37:45.784 --> 37:48.217
but not infinite, endless space.

37:48.219 --> 37:50.853
So, you know, we talked it out,

37:50.855 --> 37:53.723
and, I feel like we really
grew as a couple, so...

37:53.724 --> 37:55.157
thanks, Dad.

37:55.893 --> 37:58.193
Good for you, son.

38:00.898 --> 38:03.467
Madam Secretary, you wanted to see me?

38:05.036 --> 38:07.704
Yeah. Peter, I...

38:07.706 --> 38:10.640
I wanted to tell you that
I accept your resignation

38:10.641 --> 38:14.844
as special envoy to
Sudan and South Sudan.

38:14.846 --> 38:16.312
Well...

38:16.313 --> 38:18.348
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

38:18.349 --> 38:19.716
It was an honor to serve.

38:19.717 --> 38:22.518
I also recommended to the
president that he name you

38:22.519 --> 38:24.721
the next ambassador to the U.N.

38:24.722 --> 38:26.889
POTUS agreed.

38:28.226 --> 38:31.961
This means a great deal.

38:31.963 --> 38:35.264
Do you mind if I take a couple
of days to think it over?

38:35.266 --> 38:36.866
Well, don't take too long.

38:36.867 --> 38:38.868
As I said, we need you in the fight.

38:38.869 --> 38:41.170
Of course.

38:42.239 --> 38:44.774
I should apologize to you for
my outburst the other day.

38:44.775 --> 38:45.775
No.

38:45.777 --> 38:49.679
I should apologize to you, Peter.

38:49.681 --> 38:51.648
WWill you sit down?

38:58.289 --> 39:02.024
I could get in a lot of
trouble for telling you this,

39:02.025 --> 39:05.428
but... what the hell?

39:05.429 --> 39:09.766
I was in the Bin Laden
Issue Station at CIA

39:09.768 --> 39:11.300
in '98.

39:11.302 --> 39:12.468
We knew

39:12.469 --> 39:16.205
something was coming,

39:16.206 --> 39:18.507
we just couldn't...

39:20.411 --> 39:23.346
figure out all the
pieces fast enough.

39:23.347 --> 39:26.783
And we failed you and your colleagues,

39:26.784 --> 39:30.820
and for that, I am profoundly sorry.

39:30.822 --> 39:35.391
Don't beat yourself up too
much on that score, ma'am.

39:35.393 --> 39:38.094
There's blame enough for everybody.

39:38.096 --> 39:41.497
State knew that building was
too close to the street

39:41.498 --> 39:43.000
to be safe.

39:43.001 --> 39:46.269
The White House underfunded
security measures

39:46.271 --> 39:49.505
'cause they were so determined
to get their "peace dividend."

39:49.507 --> 39:51.875
CIA should have given
your unit more resources.

39:51.876 --> 39:53.876
On and on it goes.

39:53.878 --> 39:57.013
We all failed.

39:57.014 --> 40:01.284
But if it gives you any comfort,

40:01.286 --> 40:05.387
I forgive you.

40:07.858 --> 40:09.392
Thank you.

40:09.393 --> 40:13.764
Since we're revealing secrets...

40:15.833 --> 40:20.069
mymy grief makes me ashamed

40:20.070 --> 40:24.807
when I think about how
much others lost.

40:24.809 --> 40:27.143
Parents lost sons and daughters

40:27.144 --> 40:30.179
and husbands lost wives.

40:31.748 --> 40:36.219
Meanwhile, my wife and kids
were safe, back in D.C.,

40:36.221 --> 40:39.822
while I was running around.

40:40.592 --> 40:43.693
I think it was deeper than that.

40:47.197 --> 40:50.032
Things weren't so great
at home to start with.

40:50.034 --> 40:54.605
I volunteered for hardship
posts, like Kampala.

40:54.606 --> 40:58.341
It wasn't fair to my
wife, or the kids.

40:58.342 --> 41:01.944
But I loved the work.

41:01.945 --> 41:07.416
And I felt like we were
making a difference.

41:07.418 --> 41:09.719
So did she.

41:14.092 --> 41:16.958
Do you want to tell me about her?

41:19.329 --> 41:21.597
Well, we had very different
tastes in music,

41:21.599 --> 41:24.134
I'll tell you that.

41:24.135 --> 41:25.535
She loved indie rock.

41:25.536 --> 41:27.403
And I...

41:27.405 --> 41:29.372
I'm an old jazz guy.

41:29.373 --> 41:31.208
Even back then,
I was just a grumpy old man.

41:33.644 --> 41:37.847
We'd drive around,
those warm Kampala nights,

41:37.849 --> 41:40.616
and trade off listening to cassettes.

41:40.617 --> 41:43.352
Liz Phair, and Billie Holiday.

41:43.353 --> 41:48.324
She used to call me her
"funny valentine."

41:48.326 --> 41:50.826
My figure being less than Greek,

41:50.827 --> 41:52.562
you understand.

41:52.563 --> 41:54.030
Madam Secretary,

41:54.032 --> 41:57.033
I tend to inspire strong
reactions in people.

41:57.034 --> 42:00.870
Something usually
between grudging respect

42:00.871 --> 42:02.405
and open hostility.

42:02.407 --> 42:04.773
But she was...

42:10.047 --> 42:14.550
She was the first one

42:14.552 --> 42:18.353
to really see me.

42:21.458 --> 42:24.760
And it was wonderful.

42:27.632 --> 42:31.199
Her name was Lana.

42:33.237 --> 42:37.306
She was the love of my life.

42:43.083 --> 42:49.682
