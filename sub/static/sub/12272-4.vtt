01:08.300 --> 01:10.300
Guy in a boat spotted him
this morning.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.000
Noness.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.500
How did he get up there?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.600
I think maybe somebody
ga a lift.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.700
Okay, Super, I'm ready to cut.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.500
Lacerations to his chest.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.300
Stabbed and then hanged.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.900
I guess he wasn't
dead enough.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.300
Rope burns
on both palms.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.600
He probably tried
to pull himself up.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.900
Lift his shirt up,
will you, David?

01:45.800 --> 01:47.200
Whoa!

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
I... thought this...
guy was a guy.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.100
Check the plumping.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.100
Full male genitalia.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.700
Mutilated tranny strung up
in a tree.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.600
MAN:
Go! Go! Go! Go!

02:05.200 --> 02:06.600
Bet I know how he got up there.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.199
Hate?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.600
I NEED IT TONIGHT.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.700
????

03:40.700 --> 03:43.000
Lacerations aren't deep enough
to have killed him.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.600
Ligature furrows canted upward.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.800
Scratches... consistent
with struggling to get free.

03:50.300 --> 03:53.200
Preliminary C.O.D.'s
suffocation from hanging.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.200
GRISSOM:
18 years old.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.400
Brian Towne.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.400
Lived in Verdant Glen.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.500
Hmm. 20 years ago, my wife
wanted to buy out there,

04:04.600 --> 04:07.000
but there was no 215 freeway
back then.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.500
The commute
would've killed me.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.000
No physical signs
of Klinefelter syndrome.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.500
So he's not an XXY.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.700
No, he's all skin and muscle.

04:15.700 --> 04:17.800
These can't be fatty deposits...

04:18.200 --> 04:19.700
This is glandular tissue.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.400
His mammaries are swollen.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.500
Gynecomastia.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.400
Pre-op transsexuals
take a lot of estrogen.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.900
I'll run
an expanded tox panel,

04:29.900 --> 04:31.500
send out
for a hormone screen.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.200
It wasn't easy
being a Copa girl.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.700
When the curtain came down,

04:42.700 --> 04:45.200
we had to stay and decorate
the Sands Casino

04:45.200 --> 04:46.800
into the wee hours.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.300
Ugly guys do gamble more

04:48.300 --> 04:49.600
when there's pretty girls
to look at.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.500
They weren't all ugly.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.300
And your father,
in that tuxedo...

04:56.700 --> 04:58.600
giving me the eye,

04:58.600 --> 04:59.900
ying not to grin,

04:59.900 --> 05:02.600
'cause he thought floor managers
had to be tough.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.700
So, Mom,
who made the first move?

05:04.800 --> 05:06.500
Sam.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.900
Stuck this five-dollar chip
in my hand

05:09.900 --> 05:11.900
and said, "Take it,

05:11.900 --> 05:13.400
you can't miss."

05:14.600 --> 05:17.900
I shot craps all night with
Peter Lawford and cleaned up.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.900
I was right here the day
Sam opened the Rampart,

05:22.900 --> 05:24.600
his first casino.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.400
<i>And we were going to be
right here again</i>

05:29.400 --> 05:31.200
<i>when he opened the Eclipse.</i>

05:31.900 --> 05:34.200
I know you wanted
to be buried with this,

05:35.200 --> 05:36.900
but I just couldn't let go.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.700
I can now.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.400
They're going to build
your dream on it, honey.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.800
Take it.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.600
You can't miss.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.900
I don't care if it's
Jimmy Louise Hoffa.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.400
I want you to grab
that jackhammer

06:20.500 --> 06:21.600
and bust up this concrete.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.400
Supervisor Willowsfrom Cri

06:23.400 --> 06:25.500
What's going on here?
Worker found a body.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.900
I'm just following protocol.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
You find a body,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.200
call you guys.

06:29.700 --> 06:30.700
Yeah.
How do you know

06:30.700 --> 06:32.500
this is one
of the Marquis Chimps?

06:32.900 --> 06:35.800
'Cause they played the Frontier
in Ronald Reagan's act.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.800
<i>And only humans
have a saddle joint.</i>

06:40.000 --> 06:41.800
In fact, that's how
we were able to swing

06:41.800 --> 06:43.300
out of trees and end up here.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.100
Opposable thumbs.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.800
Well, these casinos weren't
built by saints, you know.

06:49.200 --> 06:49.900
Oh, I know.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.500
My dad built this one.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.800
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.100
Yeah, this is CSI Willows.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.700
I need to hand a case off
to Swing.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.600
Conflict of interest.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.300
I want to know who did this.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.500
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.400
Mrs. Towne, it
would be of help
if you could tell me

08:00.400 --> 08:02.200
a little bit more
about your son Brian.

08:04.800 --> 08:09.000
He was kind... and sweet

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
and... didn't have
an enemy in the world.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.200
What about friends?
Not really.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.200
He was always so busy
putting in overtime

08:17.200 --> 08:20.000
down at the...
water treatment plant.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.100
He loved to take long runs.

08:24.300 --> 08:27.100
Exercise is a natural cure
for depression.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.200
Was he depressed?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.600
I mean, there's a lot
of medications here.

08:30.700 --> 08:31.900
Are these Brian's?

08:32.100 --> 08:33.299
No. These are all mine.

08:34.299 --> 08:37.400
I had a mastectomy
eight years ago.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.000
Cancer came back
three months ago.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.400
Oh.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.300
I never thought
I'd outlive my son.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.500
Is there anything else?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.800
Did you know a person
with the last name Cyden?

08:51.800 --> 08:53.900
C-Y-D-E-N?
Paul Cyden.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.200
He's a family friend;
he lives a couple blocks over.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.500
So Brian knew him, too?

08:58.500 --> 09:02.500
Oh, he was like a father to
Brian after my husband died.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.200
Why are you asking
about Paul?

09:05.300 --> 09:07.300
Ma'am, your son had
a good deal of cash

09:07.400 --> 09:09.100
stashed away in his bedroom.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.900
Was he saving up for something?

09:13.300 --> 09:14.800
I don't know.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.800
What's going on here?

09:18.800 --> 09:20.300
Mrs. Towne, we think

09:20.300 --> 09:23.200
Brian was saving up
for a sex change operation.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.900
Were you aware
of this?

09:25.300 --> 09:27.400
My son was not a freak.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.400
No, I didn't say that.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.000
Ma'am, we're not trying
to upset you in any way.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.600
I volunteered to let you
in my house!

09:32.600 --> 09:35.100
And now I want you to leave.
I want you to leave right now!

09:45.500 --> 09:48.300
In college, I wanted
to be an archeologist,

09:48.300 --> 09:50.400
until I did a summer
on a dig in Tunisia.

09:50.700 --> 09:53.100
Hot. But that got me
into Forensics.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.500
What made you
pick Vegas?

09:54.600 --> 09:57.200
Well, it, uh,
it kind of picked me.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.700
Hey, check this out.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.700
Turquoise and silver beads.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.600
I got the matching necklace at
the Indian market in Santa Fe.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Everybody stop!

10:16.100 --> 10:17.600
Stop what
you're doing!

10:18.600 --> 10:20.200
What is the problem now?
We have just

10:20.200 --> 10:21.700
found evidence
that this might be

10:21.800 --> 10:23.600
a Native American burial site.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.500
We have to notify the
Inter-Tribal Council.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.700
Until they say so,
nobody touches anything.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.100
Hey, Grissom.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.400
About your
hanging victim.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.900
The one with
the "chesticals."

10:32.000 --> 10:33.100
The man boobs...

10:33.800 --> 10:36.000
Uh, the...
gynecomastia, sorry.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.100
Quant hormone report.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.400
Androgen's low.
Estradiol's high.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.100
It's 250 picograms
per milliliter.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.300
Arogesterone, too.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.800
Estrogen level
is five times

10:45.800 --> 10:47.500
the normal amount
for an adult male.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.500
It's consistent with
a pre-op transsexual.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.300
Yeah, but there's no other
pre-op drugs in his system.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.800
No spironolactone,
no flutamide, progesterone.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.800
e 's"do-it-yourselfer."

11:01.600 --> 11:02.300
Okay.

11:09.000 --> 11:09.600
Hello?

11:09.600 --> 11:11.300
Paul Cyden?
This is he.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.500
Paul Cyden.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.500
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
this is Catherine Willows,

11:18.600 --> 11:20.500
from the Crime Lab.
I'd like to ask you

11:20.600 --> 11:22.500
a couple questions
about Brian Towne.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.600
What a great kid.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
I can't believe he's gone.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.700
When was the last time
you talked with him?

11:27.700 --> 11:30.200
Oh, uh, honestly,
I don't remember.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.200
Oh, you don't remember
yesterday?

11:32.300 --> 11:34.300
Calling him? Texting him?

11:35.300 --> 11:37.300
Brian occasionally does odd jobs
for me.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.000
How odd?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.200
I, uh, study water.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.700
I'm a hydrologist, retired,

11:43.700 --> 11:45.100
but I still
do consulting.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.600
Brian was helping me
with a project.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.300
Well, it seems to me,
according to your messages,

11:49.300 --> 11:51.100
<i>Brian was the project.</i>

11:52.700 --> 11:53.700
You're way off base.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.800
Then you won't mind giving us
your fingerprints and DNA?

11:57.300 --> 11:58.800
Not if you have a court order.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.900
Look, you can do this
the hard way or the easy way.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.000
But trust me,
we're going to get this done.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.200
Yeah, what's up, Doc?

12:06.200 --> 12:08.100
Yeah, Brian Towne's mother
is here.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.400
She wants to see the body.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.500
Okay. If anythof interest
pops up,

12:11.600 --> 12:12.800
why don't you text me?

12:13.200 --> 12:14.500
ROBBINS:
All right.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.100
He needed a haircut.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.600
Are you lurking
around here for results?

13:15.600 --> 13:17.100
No. No, no.
I wouldn't do that.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.500
I was just, uh... I was
getting a cup of coffee.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.800
Actually.
You can come in.

13:21.900 --> 13:22.900
Why, do you got something?

13:23.200 --> 13:24.300
I do.
I got a two-fer.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.700
I got epithelials from the rope
from multiple contributors,

13:26.700 --> 13:28.100
and one of them...

13:28.300 --> 13:30.000
drank from the
bloody beer bottle.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.600
Larry Ludwig.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.300
Convicted of aggravated assault
and DUI.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.300
Bring up his
parole record. Okay.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.800
There you go.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.700
He works at the same water
treatment plant as my victim.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.300
Thought you were getting coffee.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.100
Right.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.300
You sure you fellas
don't want masks?

13:54.300 --> 13:57.200
The smell in here makes
some people puke.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.000
Mr. Ludwig, can we
see your palms, please?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.200
What, you gonna tell me
my future or something?

14:02.200 --> 14:03.700
Depends on what I see.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.500
I don't think so.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.400
Gentlemen?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.900
Hey, I was just getting
back to work, Mr. Quinn. Jonah Quinn.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.000
General Manager.
I'm Warrick Brown.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.100
And I'm Nick Stokes, we're
with the Vegas Crime Lab.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.700
We're here investigating the
death of one of your employees,

14:17.700 --> 14:18.900
Brian Towne.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.700
I told them I had
nothing to say, sir.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.900
QUINN:
You have my permission
to question and search

14:22.900 --> 14:24.400
any of my employees.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.700
They don't have warrant,
Mr. Quinn.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.500
They're just... they're
just fishing around, sirun

14:27.500 --> 14:29.000
Anybody who doesn't
want to cooperate

14:29.000 --> 14:30.600
with the police in
trying to find out

14:30.600 --> 14:34.000
who killed Brian can clean out
their lockers and search

14:34.100 --> 14:35.700
for another job!

14:37.900 --> 14:39.800
Weren't they asking
you a question?

14:41.200 --> 14:42.600
Go ahead and
take off your gloves.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.000
Show us your palms.

14:52.000 --> 14:52.300
Well, now,

14:52.400 --> 14:54.300
they look like rope burns.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.400
Did you know that there's
a Paiute reservation

14:58.400 --> 14:59.900
in the heart of Las Vegas?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.800
It's only an acre, but it's
right up on North Main.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.100
Do you think that we
found the bones

15:04.100 --> 15:05.700
of one of their
ancestors?

15:05.700 --> 15:07.400
Well, the fusing
of the plates

15:07.500 --> 15:10.000
and shape of the skull
indicate a 30-year-old

15:10.000 --> 15:11.200
of the Mongoloid race.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.200
Which does include
Native Americans.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.000
And Southeast Asians,
Pacific Islanders.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.600
But take a look
at the teeth.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.400
I don't see any dental work.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.200
But there are caries.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.300
Cavities.
Right.

15:27.400 --> 15:31.200
???

15:31.200 --> 15:34.500
????

15:34.500 --> 15:35.900
but no cavities.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.100
You look disappointed.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.600
I was... hoping, just once,

15:41.700 --> 15:43.600
Vegas would have
to honor its past.

15:45.100 --> 15:48.600
These tire treads were under
a tree where Brian's

15:48.600 --> 15:49.900
body was found.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.500
They're from a
Chevy Colorado.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.500
Isn't that what you drive?

15:55.800 --> 15:57.100
Yeah.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.900
You're putting a nice polish
on that wedding band.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.200
Hey, this is between us, right?

16:05.200 --> 16:06.700
Yeah, absolutely.
Oh, yeah.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.100
All right... I did see
Brian last night.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.300
Me and my buddy,
we started out at a bar,

16:13.700 --> 16:14.900
threw a few back, you know,

16:15.000 --> 16:16.400
met some ladies.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.700
And the hot one, she said,
"Let's go swimming."

16:26.000 --> 16:27.100
Brian. What's shaking?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Not much.

16:29.900 --> 16:30.800
Anybody want one?

16:30.800 --> 16:32.200
Yes, please.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.100
So the girls, they wanted
to play Tarzan,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.300
so I pull my pickup truck
underneath the tree,

16:37.400 --> 16:39.500
I grabbed a rope
out of my utility box,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.800
and we all started stripping
down and everything...

16:43.900 --> 16:45.000
Whoo!

16:46.300 --> 16:47.700
Come on,
it's fun!

16:57.100 --> 16:58.200
Oh, my God.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.300
What?

17:04.200 --> 17:05.700
I mean, the guy had boobs, man.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.800
I mean, you could see 'em
right through the T-shirt.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.900
I mean, we were all kind of
cracking up about it,

17:12.900 --> 17:15.099
but um... uh...

17:15.099 --> 17:16.599
it kind of broke the
party up a little bit.

17:16.599 --> 17:19.300
No, you kind of broke up
the party, man,

17:19.300 --> 17:20.900
when you cut him up
with a beer bottle

17:20.900 --> 17:21.700
and you hanged
him in a tree.

17:21.700 --> 17:25.000
Hey, man, I mean...
he ran off and we left.

17:25.900 --> 17:27.200
All right, I-I-I
don't know what else

17:27.200 --> 17:28.600
I can tell you.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.800
I mean, you can ask Tony--
he works with me, too.

17:30.900 --> 17:31.900
Where did you go?

17:31.900 --> 17:33.000
I went to the...

17:33.700 --> 17:35.800
I went to a motel with
one of, one of the girls.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.600
These girls have names?

17:39.600 --> 17:40.700
Yeah, mine
was, uh...

17:40.800 --> 17:42.700
She was named after
some city in Texas.

17:42.700 --> 17:43.900
I don't know, like, uh...

17:43.900 --> 17:46.300
Dallas or Houston or
something like that.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.500
The other one, she really
wasn't that hot,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.100
so I don't know
what her name was.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.700
You better hope
we find these girls.

17:51.700 --> 17:52.400
We better not find

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
any of Brian's blood
in your flatbed.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.300
Wow!

18:09.700 --> 18:11.900
The original plans
for the Rampart.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.100
Opening day,
New Year's Eve, 1964.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.400
Half of the hotel tower
was still under construction,

18:17.400 --> 18:19.300
but Sam decided
to have the party anyway.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.700
He's got the Midas touch,

18:20.800 --> 18:23.000
and help from the
boys in Kansas City.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.500
This is the ultimate.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.300
Don't you have work to do?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.100
Deal me in.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.100
Well...

18:33.100 --> 18:35.400
the workers found
the bones here...

18:35.400 --> 18:38.100
which corresponds to this area.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.500
Bottom of the
construction shaft.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.600
Wonder if it's Gus
"the Beauty" Finkel.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.800
Snitch, disappeared in '64.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.700
The skull shape is Mongoloid.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.800
Maybe it's Eddie Chang,
the Peking Pimp.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.900
Caught Dean at the Sands,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.900
went out for eggs,
never came back.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.400
Did the Peking Pimp

18:58.400 --> 19:00.200
ever wear anything like this
on his arm?

19:00.200 --> 19:03.200
Nope. Just French cuffs
and platinum blondes.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.300
Careful with those.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.900
They're like the Dead Sea
Scrolls of Las Vegas.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.600
I have to go back to the scene.

19:10.600 --> 19:11.700
I'm off the clock.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.700
You, uh, need a hand?

19:24.100 --> 19:26.600
67.5 inches.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.100
Not the Peking Pimp.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.300
He was only five-two.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.300
It looks like every bone
in his body is broken.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.800
Check out the third
vertebrosternal rib,

19:38.800 --> 19:40.300
left side.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.100
Isn't that a bullet hole?
Exit wound.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.700
Good call.
Document it.

19:43.700 --> 19:44.900
Nothing says "Mob hit"

19:44.900 --> 19:47.800
like shot in the chest, thrown
down a construction shaft,

19:47.800 --> 19:50.100
and tucked in under
a concrete blanket.

19:50.100 --> 19:50.800
For real?

19:52.100 --> 19:53.300
My first Mob hit.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.000
Cool.
You know,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.800
only the bones at the point
of impact should be broken.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.300
Then the implosion
must have busted up

19:59.300 --> 20:00.400
the rest of him.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.800
Hey, Ronnie?

20:05.800 --> 20:07.500
Will you take a picture of this
for me, please?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.200
Yeah.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.700
It looks like...
treated hide.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.000
Buckskin.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.500
Maybe your M.E.
was wrong.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.800
Well, only if the ancient tribes
used sewing machines.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.400
The stitches are uniform.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.500
You know, the showroom had this

20:25.600 --> 20:28.100
Wild West Revue
with cowboys,

20:28.200 --> 20:31.000
and horses, and rifles,
a real stagecoach.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.400
And Indians
who shot flaming arrows

20:33.500 --> 20:35.600
that ripped off
the dance hall girls' clothes.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.600
It ran from the day
the Rampart opened

20:37.600 --> 20:39.500
until 1976.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.600
An Indian playing
an Indian?

20:47.100 --> 20:49.800
When I was growing up, there
weren't any lakes in Vegas,

20:49.800 --> 20:51.600
just hotel swimming pools.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I think Mr. Cyden
might be dodging us.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.700
Call in a 419.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.200
So you think that's a message
or his dinner?

21:09.200 --> 21:10.800
Well, that's carp.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.600
Nobody really
eats those.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.400
Body's in full rigor.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.500
Been dead at least ten hours.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.000
Appears to be...

21:18.000 --> 21:20.500
one, two, three gunshot wounds
to the torso.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.400
Probably rules out suicide.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.300
No exit wounds.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.600
I don't see a gun
or cartridge casings anywhere.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.500
He has some fairly dense
gunshot residue patterns.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.900
Shooter was only
a couple of feet away,

21:32.900 --> 21:34.300
practically face-to-face.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.800
No signs of forced entry,
no signs of struggle.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.300
I bet he knew his killer.

21:39.100 --> 21:39.900
Maybe the same person

21:40.000 --> 21:41.900
who killed the tranny
killed the boyfriend.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.200
Offer to buy his house

21:50.200 --> 21:52.700
dated... yesterday.

21:53.600 --> 21:54.900
Who tears up an offer

21:54.900 --> 21:56.600
in this tough market?

21:58.400 --> 22:00.200
"Purchaser: Jonah Quinn."

22:00.200 --> 22:01.600
That's Brian's boss.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.300
I met him.

22:03.900 --> 22:06.200
This notebook charts
hormone levels.

22:06.500 --> 22:09.100
No names, just numbers.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.100
There's over 40
test subjects here.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.500
If this guy was running some
kind of underground clinic here,

22:15.500 --> 22:17.000
then where are the drugs?

22:18.100 --> 22:19.800
These could be hormones.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.100
Warrick found vials like that
in Brian's bedroom.

22:24.300 --> 22:26.100
Check that freezer.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.700
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

22:30.700 --> 22:32.400
Lots of them.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.000
??

22:35.000 --> 22:36.300
Shoot me a number.

22:36.900 --> 22:39.200
"R-41"

22:41.600 --> 22:43.700
"June 20, 2007."

22:43.700 --> 22:46.400
???

22:52.400 --> 22:53.700
Hodges?

22:53.700 --> 22:54.900
Here's the problem...

22:54.900 --> 22:56.800
You know, that's just
what Mom says

22:56.800 --> 22:59.100
when all I ask is to come home
for Thanksgiving.

22:59.100 --> 23:01.600
My John Doe is from 1964.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.800
Well, to quote Sherlock Sanders,

23:03.800 --> 23:05.300
"This town was built
on dead bodies."

23:05.400 --> 23:07.300
The National Missing Persons
Database

23:07.300 --> 23:10.400
only lists four persons in '64,
none of which are a match.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.800
It might help if we knew

23:11.800 --> 23:13.200
where he was from.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.600
Do I look like
the Ghost Whisperer?

23:14.600 --> 23:16.200
Every geographic area

23:16.200 --> 23:18.600
has specific levels
of oxygen isotopes

23:18.600 --> 23:21.700
due to rainfall,
climate and vegetation.

23:21.700 --> 23:25.200
And you can identify
those isotopes in bones.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.600
You do know that those isotopes
will only tell you

23:27.600 --> 23:30.700
where he spent the last three
years or so of his life.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.300
I'll take it.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.300
It's more then we have now.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.600
If this works,

23:40.900 --> 23:42.800
<i>I write the paper
for the Forensics Journal,</i>

23:42.800 --> 23:44.700
sole credit.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.500
Deal.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.200
Me and my big mouth.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.800
Sara told me
to document the detritus,

25:16.800 --> 25:18.400
but I see you beat me to it.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.900
Oh, sorry, yeah, I kind
of got carried away,

25:20.900 --> 25:23.600
but look at this-- it's
the vic's right hand.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
He was holding on to
something and when they poured

25:26.000 --> 25:27.400
the concrete
on top of him,

25:27.400 --> 25:30.200
it made kind of a fossil.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.500
Whatever it was, we must have
collected it, right?

25:33.200 --> 25:34.300
It's definitely not a gun.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.400
No, you didn't
find one of those.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.600
Cigarette lighter?

25:45.400 --> 25:46.600
No.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.100
Hey.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.000
It's film.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.500
Uh, 35 millimeters
used to come in

26:02.600 --> 26:04.900
a screw-top metal
can like this.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.200
Whatever's on it
must be important enough

26:07.200 --> 26:10.200
for Mr. Bones to hang on to
it while taking a header.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.300
Later.

26:14.100 --> 26:14.700
<i>Black and white</i>

26:14.700 --> 26:16.200
Tri-X stock.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.600
It's pretty grainy.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.700
Photographers like it
'cause you can shoot fast.

26:21.400 --> 26:25.000
It's like finding pictures
of Lincoln at Ford's Theatre.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.700
The party was
on the rooftop.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.900
Bring up that last shot
on the roll.

26:37.700 --> 26:38.600
Hmm.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.000
Let's see if we can take
a better look at that.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.400
Looks like the casino take
on opening day.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.500
Everybody got a cut...

26:47.700 --> 26:51.500
thds, the state...
and something called Fergus.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.500
I love it when
you dress up.

26:59.800 --> 27:00.900
Well, you know,

27:00.900 --> 27:03.200
whatever it takes to
get some time with you.

27:04.100 --> 27:04.900
How's the study going?

27:04.900 --> 27:07.100
Any sign of Colony
Collapse Disorder?

27:07.100 --> 27:09.300
Nope, so far it's healthy.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.600
Nothing too healthy
about smoking.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.600
Well, the scent confuses
the guard bees.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.600
They won't emit
the pheromone

27:16.800 --> 27:19.700
that tells the colony
there's an intruder.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.300
Don't rry, he's harmless.

27:26.300 --> 27:27.500
Who's who?

27:27.500 --> 27:29.200
These are
the workers...

27:29.400 --> 27:31.000
infertile females.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.100
They don't sting?

27:32.100 --> 27:34.100
No, not unless you swat one,

27:34.101 --> 27:35.734
??

27:34.100 --> 27:36.600
Go ahead, take off your glove.

27:39.300 --> 27:42.200
Eh... all right, I trust you.

27:45.800 --> 27:46.400
See?

27:46.400 --> 27:47.900
It's cool.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.100
The worker bees
defend the hive,

27:52.100 --> 27:54.800
procure the pollen,
makehe honey,

27:54.800 --> 27:56.500
nurture the larvae and pupae

27:56.500 --> 27:58.300
in each of these
brood cells.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.800
You know,
maybe we should get married.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.400
Ouch!

28:10.400 --> 28:11.200
Oh, oh...
Ow.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.700
No, no, don't, don't,
don't pick it out.

28:16.700 --> 28:20.800
Makes it worse, releases the
venom into the bloodstream.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.600
It's better
to scrape it.

28:29.600 --> 28:33.400
So, uh... what do you think,
you know, about...

28:33.400 --> 28:35.000
Yes.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.000
Let's do it.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.200
Yeah?

28:57.400 --> 28:58.600
Hi, Sara.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.900
You look
like you're having a good day.

29:00.900 --> 29:01.900
Thanks.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.400
Got your
isotope results.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
My John Doe lived

29:07.600 --> 29:08.600
in Southeast Asia?

29:08.600 --> 29:10.200
Yeah, uh, more specifically,

29:10.200 --> 29:11.600
southern Vietnam.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.300
Like I said,
this test only dates back

29:13.300 --> 29:14.100
to the last three years

29:14.100 --> 29:15.000
of his life.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.400
In '64... soldier?

29:19.400 --> 29:21.500
Consultant, refugee?

29:21.700 --> 29:23.600
Thanks. Hm.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.900
Let me know if you get an I.D.

29:24.900 --> 29:27.000
It'd be a great touch
for the article.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.200
Hey, what are you up to?

29:33.200 --> 29:34.500
Nothing.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.900
Why?

29:40.600 --> 29:42.100
What's in the cooler?

29:44.100 --> 29:45.400
Carp.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.500
Paul Cyden died

29:46.500 --> 29:47.900
holding one.

29:47.900 --> 29:49.200
He had a freezer
full of them,

29:49.200 --> 29:51.000
some kind of an experiment.

29:51.300 --> 29:52.500
Huh.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.000
I can process those
fish if you like.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.600
Do I know how
to turn you on or what?

30:05.800 --> 30:06.900
Hey.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.100
Heard you were
looking for me.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.200
Yeah, our friend Larry Ludwig--

30:09.200 --> 30:12.000
he's sharp as a marble,
but his alibi checked out.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.100
We found the motel
and the girl.

30:14.100 --> 30:15.300
Really?

30:16.800 --> 30:17.900
What's her name?

30:17.900 --> 30:18.700
Tucson.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.200
Ah, yes.

30:20.200 --> 30:23.000
Tucson, the capital of Texas.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.600
Well, Paul Cyden's DNA and
fingerprints finally arrived.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.100
Well, I'll run it, but
I don't think it'll matter.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.800
I think Brian killed himself.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.300
You think he just climbed that
big ol' tree all by himself?

30:36.300 --> 30:37.900
eah.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.700
Okay, yeah.

30:39.700 --> 30:40.900
What about the mutilation?

30:40.900 --> 30:42.600
Self-inflicted.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.800
It took a while,
but Mandy was able to recover

30:44.800 --> 30:46.500
some prints
from the beer bottle,

30:46.500 --> 30:48.100
but it came back to Brian.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.800
So this was a hate crime.

31:16.800 --> 31:17.900
Yeah.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.000
???

31:32.200 --> 31:33.100
Yes?

31:33.200 --> 31:36.000
Oh, sorry,
just a bad habit

31:36.000 --> 31:38.700
from when we worked
the Miniature case together.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.000
That was fun, wasn't it?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.600
I thought so.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.500
What do you see?

31:46.200 --> 31:48.800
Well, those are
eggs... it's a girl.

31:50.500 --> 31:54.000
And those white organs
would be gonads.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.600
Male and female parts.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.900
Simultaneous herma??

31:58.900 --> 31:59.800
Stop me if you
already know this,

31:59.800 --> 32:02.200
t some fish do change sex
naturally.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.900
Not carp.

32:04.200 --> 32:04.900
I heard of a study

32:04.900 --> 32:07.700
when I was attending
a forensics consortium in D.C.

32:08.300 --> 32:11.100
Feminized male bass were found
in the wastewater effluent

32:11.100 --> 32:12.600
of the Potomac River.

32:16.100 --> 32:16.900
It's the water.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.400
Yeah, it was full
of excreted pharmaceuticals

32:19.400 --> 32:21.800
and what they called
"personal care products,"

32:22.100 --> 32:24.899
all of which supposedly altered
the endocrine system

32:24.900 --> 32:26.300
of the fish and their young.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.000
Good, Hodges.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.900
Well, now that we're
working together again...

32:35.700 --> 32:37.500
...take at least
two organ samples

32:37.500 --> 32:39.199
along with blood.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.999
Send them with
these water samples

32:41.000 --> 32:44.300
to our clinical lab
for hormone quants.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.100
You got it, partner.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.800
Melvin Fergus.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.000
He was
a gaming commissioner.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.900
"Honest Melvin."

32:56.900 --> 32:58.499
Well, it looks
like Honest Melvin

32:58.500 --> 32:59.599
was on the take.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.200
Bribing a public
official could cost you

33:01.200 --> 33:02.400
your gaming license.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.900
Maybe our dead guy
found out about it

33:04.900 --> 33:07.600
and somebody found out about
him finding out about it.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.300
Who was this dead guy?

33:09.300 --> 33:12.000
Some wisenheimer with
extortion on the brain.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.800
Maybe a reporter.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.200
Hi, Lily.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.700
Hi.

33:16.700 --> 33:17.900
Uh, Wendy ran that tooth.

33:17.900 --> 33:19.400
Pre-CODIS, but DNA confirms

33:19.400 --> 33:21.600
that our John Doe
was Native American,

33:21.600 --> 33:24.400
so it was
one Indian's burial ground.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.299
There was a reporter
and I'm pretty sure

33:27.300 --> 33:29.000
he was an Indian.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.900
Lee George.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.299
He'd just come back
from Vietnam

33:34.300 --> 33:35.600
<i>for Life magazine</i>

33:35.600 --> 33:38.600
and he was doing
a piece on Vegas.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.700
Do you remember if
he was at the party?

33:40.700 --> 33:45.500
Yeah, in this little
Indian costume...

33:45.500 --> 33:47.700
bracelets on his biceps,

33:47.700 --> 33:50.100
and boy,
did he have biceps.

33:50.100 --> 33:51.300
Trust me.

33:51.300 --> 33:54.499
If anybody hurt him,
it was Benny Dunbar,

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
Sam's bodyguard.

33:57.100 --> 34:00.500
That lump in his jacket
ain't a heart full of love.

34:29.100 --> 34:31.500
I'll take that camera,
kemosabe.

34:48.300 --> 34:49.099
Either Benny tossed him

34:49.100 --> 34:50.400
or he jumped.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.500
We'll never know.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.100
This is great
stuff for my book.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.500
Your what?

34:57.800 --> 35:00.800
Oh, this little piece
on Vegas history...

35:00.800 --> 35:02.500
stories that didn't
make the papers.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.900
Honey, if you need
to know anything, just ask me.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.400
I was there.

35:07.900 --> 35:11.100
Well, how about if I take
you to dinner tonight?

35:11.300 --> 35:12.200
A bottle and a bird.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.800
We'll talk about
the Peking Pimp.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.500
Eddie Chang.

35:15.700 --> 35:18.800
They shipped him
home in pieces.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.300
20 years ago, Verdant Glen
was far enough outside Vegas

35:23.300 --> 35:25.999
to get the right to use
well water for drinking.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.900
They also got approval to remove
waste water at a private plant.

35:28.900 --> 35:31.900
There, it was cleaned,
creating "grey water,"

35:31.900 --> 35:34.400
which was used for
secondary purposes...

35:34.400 --> 35:36.900
watering lawns,
washing cars,

35:36.900 --> 35:38.499
everything but drinking.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.800
The treatment plant then
stored excess grey water

35:41.800 --> 35:43.100
in the reservoir.

35:43.100 --> 35:46.000
Where they let the kids
fish and swim.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.899
It passed
every water quality test.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.099
And the carp
from Paul Cyden's freezer had

35:50.100 --> 35:53.400
high levels of estrogen
plus other prescription drugs.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.900
Brian's level and tox panel
correlate to the carp.

35:55.900 --> 35:58.100
Cyden was collecting
water samples

35:58.100 --> 36:00.099
from the reservoir,
the tap,

36:00.100 --> 36:01.699
and the treatment plant.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.200
Thanks to Brian.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.000
According to Cyden's
research, the hormone levels

36:05.000 --> 36:07.599
in the tap water are
nearly equal to the water

36:07.600 --> 36:08.500
in the reservoir.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.900
I thought they drink
ground water.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.800
They do.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.899
Cyden was convinced
that the ground water

36:12.900 --> 36:14.000
was contaminated.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.200
How? He discovered
that the reservoir

36:16.200 --> 36:19.500
was improperly lined,
allowing the grey water

36:19.500 --> 36:20.599
to leech
into the ground water.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.800
Well, if that's the case,

36:22.800 --> 36:25.400
why didn't the other boys
develop breasts?

36:25.400 --> 36:25.999
There's a good chance

36:26.000 --> 36:27.100
that others have been affected,

36:27.100 --> 36:28.399
especially children
who were born

36:28.400 --> 36:31.000
to women who were living there
while they were pregnant.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Because the womb
is the only place

36:32.000 --> 36:33.600
a human lives
in fluid...

36:34.000 --> 36:35.400
like a fish.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.500
That reservoir
is supposed to be lined

36:38.500 --> 36:40.400
to prevent contamination

36:40.600 --> 36:41.600
Obviously,
it's not.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.300
Or the lining's defects

36:43.900 --> 36:46.000
Which is the decision I
think Cyden had come to

36:46.000 --> 36:47.900
right before he was shot.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.800
You don't know
where he got tho ges.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.400
Cyden could have pulled them
from raw sewage for alI ow.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.600
And just
for the record,

36:54.600 --> 36:55.999
that reservoir
was built to code.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.300
You show me one complaint,
one documented illness

36:58.300 --> 36:59.700
from tt water.

36:59.700 --> 37:01.500
What about Brian Towne?

37:02.100 --> 37:03.000
Listen...

37:03.900 --> 37:05.600
it's a tragedy...

37:06.100 --> 37:08.600
but his mother
has breast cancer.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.599
You don't think it's that gene
pool that might be polluted?

37:11.600 --> 37:12.900
Let me ask you something.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.299
Why did you offer to
pay such a big price

37:14.300 --> 37:16.100
for Paul Cyden's house?

37:16.100 --> 37:17.200
He's a nut.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.800
He was trying to sink me.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.399
His research was wrong,

37:20.400 --> 37:23.300
but perception
is reality these days.

37:23.300 --> 37:23.799
I admit it.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.199
I was trying to buy him off.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.800
Would have been money
well spent.

37:26.800 --> 37:29.200
But he turned you down.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.900
Is that whyou shot him?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.300
I mean, with Brian gone,
you're in the clear.

37:37.300 --> 37:40.500
Look, I don't need a gun;
I've got lawyers.

37:40.700 --> 37:43.500
??to speak to them now.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.400
Here's t@U bullets
pulled from Paul Cyden.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.500
Thanks.

37:50.500 --> 37:51.300
Mm-hmm.

37:55.800 --> 37:58.200
Well, all three
are jacketed hollow points

37:58.200 --> 37:59.399
with a center post.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.900
??

38:00.900 --> 38:03.300
Only one company makes them... deral.

38:05.300 --> 38:06.700
You know what?

38:07.900 --> 38:10.400
??

38:10.400 --> 38:12.200
in Brian Towne's bedroom.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.500
Five bullets missing.

38:24.500 --> 38:28.800
Got five lands and grooves,
right-hand twist.

38:29.200 --> 38:34.200
Could've been fired from
a Smand Wesson, Ruger, or a Taurus.

38:34.700 --> 38:37.900
Brian bought a Ruger SP 101
revolver two weeks ago.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.799
Damn.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.300
The mother had
access to that gun

38:42.300 --> 38:44.100
and motive.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.100
<i>I was too busy</i>

38:47.100 --> 38:49.100
taking care of me...

38:50.600 --> 38:52.900
to see what was wrong with him.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.600
The signs were there.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.300
Mrs. Towne,
don't blame yourself.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.100
You had a teenager who was
depressed and not communicating

39:02.100 --> 39:03.700
and you push too hard
and they pull away...

39:03.700 --> 39:05.400
I should have pushed.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.800
If I had gone through his
room before he died...

39:10.900 --> 39:12.700
maybe then...

39:13.600 --> 39:15.400
Is that when you found his gun?

39:18.800 --> 39:21.300
I was trying to understand why.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.000
I went through
his e-mails.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.500
Paul was taking him to L.A.

39:32.200 --> 39:35.600
I trusted him,
all those years

39:35.600 --> 39:38.700
that he pretended
to be our friend...

39:41.900 --> 39:43.900
He killed my son.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.000
Mrs. Towne...

39:48.000 --> 39:49.799
he was trying to save your son,

39:49.800 --> 39:51.100
not hurt him.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.300
We found this letter
on Paul's computer.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.900
You need to read it.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.500
<i>"I have decided to alert you</i>

39:59.500 --> 40:02.900
<i>"to this grave matter
prior to contacting the EPA.</i>

40:02.900 --> 40:04.800
<i>"It is
my professional conclusion</i>

40:04.800 --> 40:06.300
<i>"that the water
in this community</i>

40:06.300 --> 40:09.900
<i>"contains unsafe levels
of pharmaceutical contaminants,</i>

40:09.900 --> 40:11.400
<i>"which have caused
irreparable harm</i>

40:11.400 --> 40:13.500
<i>"to wildlife and humans.</i>

40:13.500 --> 40:16.599
<i>"One specific example
is the case of Brian Towne.</i>

40:16.600 --> 40:18.600
<i>"His endocrine system
and physical body</i>

40:18.600 --> 40:21.300
<i>"have been 'feminized'
due to chronic ingestion</i>

40:21.300 --> 40:23.600
<i>of the water at Verdant Glen."</i>

40:24.100 --> 40:26.200
He was going
to blow the whistle.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.900
I think that's what Paul
was trying to explain to you

40:30.900 --> 40:33.300
when you went over
to confront him.

40:37.900 --> 40:41.300
I worked two jobs
to keep us in our house

40:41.300 --> 40:45.800
because...
because Brian loved it so much.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.900
And being there
is what killed him.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.899
<i>The feds have already swooped in</i>

41:03.900 --> 41:05.400
to investigate
the water problem.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.400
Do they plan
to prosecute Jonah Quinn?

41:07.400 --> 41:10.100
They'll try, but Quinn
isn't the only one involved.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.699
Verdant Glen is now
owned by a conglomerate--

41:12.700 --> 41:14.699
the Altimera World Group.

41:14.700 --> 41:17.400
They'll bring in experts
to contradict the research,

41:17.400 --> 41:18.499
discredit witnesses.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.700
They'll say that
there are chemicals

41:19.700 --> 41:22.900
in everything that we
eat, touch, breathe.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.000
It'll be in
litigation for years.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.099
What about Brian's mother?

41:27.100 --> 41:28.500
Are you going
to prosecute her?

41:28.500 --> 41:30.500
Did you recover
the murder weapon,

41:31.500 --> 41:33.200
find her prints

41:33.200 --> 41:38.200
in blood at Cyden's house,
or get a signed confession?

41:38.200 --> 41:39.400
Her son's gun

41:39.400 --> 41:42.500
plus motive...
that's not enough?

41:42.500 --> 41:45.600
She's a widow
with breast cancer

41:45.700 --> 41:47.300
who lost her only kid.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.400
No way I'd get her
in front of a jury

41:53.400 --> 41:55.100
and ask them to convict.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.400
Nice work though.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.700
Lynn Towne goes free.

42:03.100 --> 42:05.200
It's all
out of our hands now.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.100
That's not enough for me.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.400
If their lawyers can
hog-tie the EPA for years,

42:11.400 --> 42:13.300
someone's got to
go around them.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.000
They've got to take Brian's
story and the research

42:16.000 --> 42:17.700
to the press.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.900
I mean, if... if
it's happened here,

42:19.900 --> 42:22.200
??

42:22.200 --> 42:26.300
???

42:26.600 --> 42:28.700
You'll get fired.

42:31.300 --> 42:33.600
As a mother, maybe I don't care.
