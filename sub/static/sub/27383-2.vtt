00:10.088 --> 00:13.592
The dog gave you
a wee bit of a scare
the other day.

00:13.625 --> 00:16.361
A stroke?
That's what I said.

00:16.394 --> 00:18.664
But he didn't have a stroke.
That's what they said.

00:18.697 --> 00:20.231
Why'd you thinks
he was havin' a strokes?

00:20.265 --> 00:22.333
Well, he was out layin'
in the sun for a few hours,

00:22.367 --> 00:25.036
when he came back up the house,
his back end was all honey dick.

00:25.537 --> 00:27.005
How so?

00:27.038 --> 00:30.241
Well, it was like he was trying
to walk and scratch himself
at the same time

00:30.275 --> 00:32.343
and his brain couldn't figure
out which one to focus on.

00:32.377 --> 00:33.411
So what did you do?

00:33.444 --> 00:34.713
I said, "Oh, fuck, this is it."

00:34.746 --> 00:35.714
Is that what you did?

00:35.747 --> 00:36.582
I said, "Oh, fuck,
you're getting the needle.

00:36.615 --> 00:38.216
"Better get one ready
for me, too."

00:38.249 --> 00:39.551
He's okay, good buddy.

00:39.585 --> 00:40.652
Oh, fuck,
"If we're diggin' a hole,

00:40.686 --> 00:42.087
"better dig a big one,
I'm gettin' in there with him."

00:42.120 --> 00:43.121
But it's all been sorted?

00:43.154 --> 00:45.290
Oh, it's all sorted but I said,
"Oh, fuck," Dary.

00:45.323 --> 00:47.492
Yeah, we oughta leave
this world behind.
That's what I said.

00:47.526 --> 00:50.428
You knew that he was
on bladder meds
for the last three weeks.

00:50.461 --> 00:51.697
Fuckin' geezer.

00:51.730 --> 00:54.499
And that he'd be passing
the bladder stones
sometime around now

00:54.533 --> 00:56.301
and to expect
some odd behavior,

00:56.334 --> 00:58.136
you still go
worst case scenario?

00:58.169 --> 00:59.470
I said, "Oh, fuck, this is it."

00:59.505 --> 01:00.506
And what was the verdict?

01:01.507 --> 01:02.440
Passin' bladder stones.

01:02.473 --> 01:05.276
Exactly. Just passing
some bladder stones.

01:05.310 --> 01:06.377
There a fuckin' echo
in here, Katy?

01:06.411 --> 01:07.679
I think he faked it.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.315
Faked what?

01:10.348 --> 01:11.617
A stroke.

01:11.650 --> 01:13.819
Why would the dog
fakes a strokes?

01:13.852 --> 01:18.056
Gus faked a stroke so that
he could go to the vet and get
a thermometer up the bum.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.694
Look, if you're comin'...

01:24.295 --> 01:25.831
you better come correct.

01:25.864 --> 01:29.501
Well, look how Stormy responds
to a thermometer up the bum.
Hates her life.

01:29.535 --> 01:30.769
No time for a knuckler
there either.

01:30.802 --> 01:31.737
No time for a two‐knuckler.

01:31.770 --> 01:33.639
There's no such thing
as a three‐knuckler.

01:33.672 --> 01:35.040
Which we've established.

01:35.073 --> 01:38.443
Cito, too. Even the sight
of a thermometer,
send him scrambling.

01:38.476 --> 01:40.679
Yeah. God help the vet
tries to throw a knuckler
up Cito's bum.

01:40.712 --> 01:42.280
Vet might not get that one back.

01:42.313 --> 01:43.348
What are you sayin' here, Katy?

01:43.381 --> 01:45.617
I'm saying that Gus is...

01:45.651 --> 01:47.352
Look, if you're comin'...
you better come correct!

01:47.385 --> 01:48.386
Gus is gay.

01:54.726 --> 01:55.761
No, he isn't.

01:55.794 --> 01:57.162
Yeah, he is.

01:57.596 --> 01:58.697
No, he isn't.

01:58.730 --> 01:59.598
Yeah, he is.

01:59.631 --> 02:01.432
Have you ever seen him
mount a female?

02:03.702 --> 02:05.203
He's a gentleman.

02:05.236 --> 02:07.673
But you've seen him mount
countless males.

02:07.706 --> 02:10.576
He'd mount the red‐hot tailpipe
of a high CC quad.
Katy, come off it!

02:10.609 --> 02:12.578
What if he is gay?
What's the big deal?

02:12.611 --> 02:13.645
I don't give a fuck if he's gay.

02:13.679 --> 02:14.846
Maybe you do.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.381
Maybe you think that...

02:16.414 --> 02:17.716
Just gimme a minute.
Gotta let that...

02:18.884 --> 02:20.786
Gotta let that marinate.

02:20.819 --> 02:23.354
Hey, Dary,
what if Gus was gay?

02:23.388 --> 02:24.489
I don't give a fuck
if he's gay.

02:24.523 --> 02:26.625
Dan, what if Gus is gay?

02:26.658 --> 02:29.394
Well, Professor Tricia's...
I withdraw.

02:29.427 --> 02:31.797
See, Wayne, Gus is gay.
What's the big deal?

02:31.830 --> 02:34.399
I already said I don't give
a fuck if he's gay.

02:34.432 --> 02:35.801
Well, that makes me very happy.

02:35.834 --> 02:37.736
Just don't, uh...

02:37.769 --> 02:40.305
Don't go sayin' that
around McMurray.
Why?

02:40.338 --> 02:42.373
McMurray gets weird
about that stuff.

02:42.407 --> 02:43.308
How so?

02:43.341 --> 02:46.277
Like, he's fine with it,
if you're gay...

02:47.312 --> 02:48.113
If you're queer.

02:49.447 --> 02:52.250
Maybe he'd like to get
honey dickin'.

02:52.283 --> 02:56.187
He just, uh, gets kind of weird
talkin' about it, is all.

02:56.221 --> 02:57.723
How does he talk about it?

02:57.756 --> 02:59.257
Well, he'll just get
all uncomfortable, you know.

02:59.290 --> 03:01.459
He'll be like, ahem...

03:01.492 --> 03:05.531
"Uh, you know, if one of them
come up to me and say,
'You're fuckin' cute, bud...'

03:05.564 --> 03:07.232
"From what I said
right from the start

03:07.265 --> 03:09.635
"at the very beginning,
'I ain't one of ya.'"

03:09.668 --> 03:11.670
That is about the best shit
I've heard all day.

03:11.703 --> 03:16.441
Ahem, "If they ever come up
to me and say,
'Fuck, are you cute, bud.'"

03:16.474 --> 03:18.777
"You wanna know what I said
right from the start
at the very beginning?"

03:18.810 --> 03:21.913
"Yeah, uh, I... I love my wife.
And you know, uh..."

03:21.947 --> 03:23.181
Keep it away from me?

03:23.214 --> 03:24.750
"No... not around me."

03:24.783 --> 03:26.417
"Because, I ain't one of ya."

03:26.451 --> 03:27.786
This is fascinating.

03:27.819 --> 03:28.954
You know, Professor Tricia...

03:28.987 --> 03:31.322
You know what, Dan? Enough!

03:31.356 --> 03:32.624
WAYNE: "Ahem, I ain't one of ya.

03:32.658 --> 03:35.493
"No, but, uh,

I don't really care, I mean,

03:44.803 --> 03:46.838
"I don't like being told what
to do myself there, either."

"Ever been down Caico?"

"Plenty of yous down Miami."

"Oh, hot jimmy‐don‐bobby,
I been down to Miami."

04:27.679 --> 04:29.648
You all right with it
if the dog's gay?

04:29.681 --> 04:32.584
Much told gays
are here to stay. So...

04:32.618 --> 04:36.287

spring that red rocket
when he's up on your lap.

Fuck you, Jonesy.

07:58.123 --> 08:01.793
Your mom ugly cried
'cause she left the lens cap
on the camcorder last night.

08:01.827 --> 08:03.562
It's fuckin' amateur hour
over there! (FARTS)

08:03.595 --> 08:05.597
BOTH: Fuck you, Shoresy!

08:11.002 --> 08:12.604
That's it, Roaldy.

08:12.638 --> 08:14.840
Just enough to turn it green.

08:14.873 --> 08:17.709
I never thought I'd be able
to put a wholesome spin
on drug dealing,

08:17.743 --> 08:18.744
but here we are.

08:18.777 --> 08:21.813
GHB is the best party drug
when used properly.

08:21.847 --> 08:22.714
What's it like?

08:22.748 --> 08:25.050
It's like the chattiness
of good blow,

08:25.083 --> 08:26.718
with the euphoric high
of good M.

08:26.752 --> 08:28.019
No way!

08:28.053 --> 08:30.856
And half the come down.
No way.

08:30.889 --> 08:32.023
And you keep your appetite.

08:32.057 --> 08:33.158
Dee‐lish.

08:33.191 --> 08:35.160
Kinda just flail.

08:35.193 --> 08:36.361
Ho‐lee.

08:36.394 --> 08:40.632
But when used improperly,
it's the date rape drug.
Ew.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.500
That's why we put
green dye in it.

08:42.534 --> 08:44.770
In case some
financial district chauch

08:44.803 --> 08:48.239
with contentious intentions
tries to slip it
into some girl's drink...

08:48.974 --> 08:50.041
...she'll know.

08:50.075 --> 08:51.977
I'd sure like to try it.

08:52.010 --> 08:54.980
I like sober Roald.
I like sober Gae.

08:55.013 --> 08:56.782
STEWART: Gae...

08:56.815 --> 08:59.050
Can't feel my legs...

08:59.084 --> 09:01.687
Not as much
as I like sober Stewart.

09:02.921 --> 09:04.723
We'll go to the club
at midnight.

09:04.756 --> 09:05.991

Sure thing, partner.

be the ones

09:22.541 --> 09:24.843

this place

09:29.881 --> 09:31.883
I don't know,

09:33.018 --> 09:34.553
Just between us girls?

09:34.586 --> 09:36.822
(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

09:38.757 --> 09:40.659
I'm a little concerned
about my electrolytes.

09:40.692 --> 09:41.893
Feels like they're
a little bit depleted.

09:44.696 --> 09:46.197
You gotta stay hydrated.

09:58.877 --> 10:01.847
Look, if your pee isn't clear,
you're not hydrated.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.481
Just gotta approach this thing
like a marathon runner.

10:03.515 --> 10:06.885
Throwin' so much hip in this
sort of weather's a great way
to get heat stroke.

10:06.918 --> 10:08.620
Ever had heat stroke?
No.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.556
You don't want it.

10:27.639 --> 10:29.207
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

10:29.240 --> 10:31.109
I'm actually surprised
to see you out here doing this.

10:31.142 --> 10:33.044
Suppose you gotta find time
for other things, though.

10:33.078 --> 10:34.312
The day'll get away on ya.

10:44.055 --> 10:47.726
You know, I don't mean to bring
this up to your back door
like this or anything...

10:47.759 --> 10:50.028
No, no.
If a friend asks for help,
you help him.

10:50.061 --> 10:51.096
I'm not complaining.

10:51.129 --> 10:52.397
I know you better than that.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.733

that's fuckin' Timbits hockey.

11:27.465 --> 11:29.300
I did!
No, you didn't. Look!

11:29.334 --> 11:30.401
Why are they green?

11:30.435 --> 11:31.803
Because someone put G in them.

11:31.837 --> 11:33.338
G's not green.
BIANCA: Yes, it is!

11:33.371 --> 11:35.440
DEALER: No, it isn't.
ALY: Yes, it is.

11:35.473 --> 11:37.408
And you shouldn't sell
that stuff anymore.
It's not safe.

11:37.442 --> 11:39.778
It's not supposed
to be safe. It's drugs.

11:39.811 --> 11:42.313
It doesn't matter anyway.
No one will buy it
from you that way.

11:42.347 --> 11:43.782
Let's go find who's selling
the green stuff.

11:43.815 --> 11:45.216

is selling in here?

Yeah. And keeping us safe.

No, they're not Amish.
They're Mennonite.

14:14.399 --> 14:15.567
What's the difference?

14:15.601 --> 14:18.436
Mennonites can use
cars and electricity.
Amish can't.

shit heads without any
consequence from their parents.

They can still go home
and have a bed to sleep
in no matter what.

Why just let them
go be shit heads?

14:39.791 --> 14:43.328

whether or not they want to stay
in the English world permanently

to the Mennonite world
and be with their families.
