WEBVTT

00:09.057 --> 00:09.697
Hey!

00:10.120 --> 00:11.454
What are you... what are you doing?

00:11.980 --> 00:13.714
Um, just some stuff.

00:13.895 --> 00:16.626
No, you were...
you're trying to rob the store.

00:17.704 --> 00:19.038
Yeah.

00:19.299 --> 00:21.042
Well, you... put it back.

00:21.870 --> 00:23.671
Uh, I don't think I'm gonna.

00:23.705 --> 00:27.575
Wh... well, I caught
you, so, y-you have to.

00:27.609 --> 00:29.076
Um, I don't think I do.

00:29.111 --> 00:32.079
But th... that's how this works.

00:32.113 --> 00:34.842
No, don't just... no. Don't take more.

00:34.990 --> 00:35.798
Do you have a gun?

00:35.899 --> 00:37.418
No! Maybe.

00:37.452 --> 00:38.838
Maybe I do.

00:40.722 --> 00:42.664
Uh, I-I don't think you do.

00:42.891 --> 00:46.181
Well, I don't think you do,
so, you know, it's a tie.

00:46.728 --> 00:48.464
What do you think about that?

00:49.798 --> 00:52.433
Okay. Excuse me.

00:52.467 --> 00:53.801
Oh. Wait!

00:53.835 --> 00:55.202
No, no, no, no! No, he... no.

00:55.237 --> 00:56.871
- Who is that?
- He's a stealer...

00:56.905 --> 00:58.239
uh, thief. He's a thief.

00:58.273 --> 00:59.740
You can run, but you can't hide!

01:04.780 --> 01:07.381
- Jonah, call the police!
- Right.

01:07.416 --> 01:09.917
Look who's grounded now.

01:09.951 --> 01:12.930
Jonah, I just did
a "Law & Order" type zinger.

01:13.422 --> 01:15.056
Oh, he's calling the police.

01:15.090 --> 01:17.566
Not on my watch, buddy.

01:18.876 --> 01:22.547
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:22.864 --> 01:25.332
I saw immediately
it was a 487 in progress.

01:25.367 --> 01:26.967
The perp appeared to be unarmed.

01:27.002 --> 01:29.437
I did not see him violate
my colleague, however,

01:29.471 --> 01:31.972
he could have violated him
before I arrived on the scene.

01:32.007 --> 01:35.142
- Is that what happened?
- No, he did not violate me.

01:35.177 --> 01:36.577
Well, you just had such
a shameful look on your face

01:36.611 --> 01:38.245
when I showed up.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.814
I don't know what he could have
done to you beforehand,

01:39.848 --> 01:41.649
but it is not your fault
if he touched you.

01:41.683 --> 01:43.017
Okay, okay. Nothing happened.

01:43.051 --> 01:44.752
All right? I caught him stealing.

01:44.786 --> 01:45.770
End of story.

01:45.771 --> 01:47.655
And you made no attempt to stop him?

01:47.689 --> 01:51.125
No, I mean, I told him
to stop, but he didn't.

01:51.159 --> 01:53.770
And then he asked me to
move and just took off.

01:54.229 --> 01:55.280
Wait, I'm sorry.

01:55.592 --> 01:57.698
He asked you to move out
of the way so he could leave

01:57.732 --> 02:00.101
with the cash, and you just did it?

02:00.135 --> 02:02.703
He... well... he said,
"Excuse me," you know?

02:02.736 --> 02:04.417
So it was for of, like, a reflex.

02:05.040 --> 02:05.951
Oh, wow.

02:06.099 --> 02:08.209
What is going on in this neighborhood?

02:08.243 --> 02:10.311
We got robbed, Home Depot got robbed,

02:10.345 --> 02:12.313
that weird store that
only makes copies got robbed.

02:12.347 --> 02:15.216
I'm scared to even walk
to my car alone at night.

02:15.250 --> 02:19.353
That is why everyone
gets a rape whistle.

02:19.387 --> 02:21.856
- That's a kazoo.
- Yeah, we had an overstock.

02:21.890 --> 02:23.653
So everyone gets a rape kazoo.

02:25.574 --> 02:27.461
I also think we need parking lot buddies

02:27.496 --> 02:30.064
so that no one has to walk to
their car alone at night.

02:30.098 --> 02:31.799
I'll be paired with anyone but Sarah.

02:31.833 --> 02:33.467
That girl's got, like, a huge

02:33.502 --> 02:35.202
restraining order against me.

02:35.237 --> 02:38.448
I'll take any guy who's 6'2"
with blue eyes.

02:39.407 --> 02:41.542
Wait, we're talking about
picking boyfriends, right?

02:42.577 --> 02:44.178
I'll take Justine.

02:44.212 --> 02:45.880
The robbers will probably
kill her before they kill me.

02:45.914 --> 02:47.982
Since I don't drive,
could you assign someone

02:48.016 --> 02:49.817
to walk me to the bus stop
and wait with me?

02:49.851 --> 02:51.819
We're not picking. We're drawing names

02:51.853 --> 02:54.021
so that it's fair. I will go first.

02:54.055 --> 02:57.658
Mine is... Myrtle, so I'm gonna go again

02:57.692 --> 02:59.326
because everybody gets one re-do.

02:59.361 --> 03:02.997
So my real one is Cheyenne,
and that one's final.

03:03.031 --> 03:05.232
Can I be paired with Mateo, actually?

03:05.267 --> 03:07.168
We usually go to trivia night together.

03:07.202 --> 03:08.702
Oh, you guys do a trivia night?

03:09.127 --> 03:09.972
That sounds fun.

03:09.973 --> 03:11.839
I still say I got robbed last week.

03:11.873 --> 03:14.341
Women do not produce eggs.
That's chickens.

03:14.376 --> 03:17.178
Garrett mocked you so hard for that.

03:17.212 --> 03:21.682
He was all like, you know, funny stuff.

03:21.716 --> 03:25.119
So, like, almost everyone
goes to this trivia night?

03:25.153 --> 03:28.086
- Yeah.
- Solid crew.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.444
I love trivia.

03:31.556 --> 03:34.933
Sorry.

03:35.464 --> 03:36.697
I'm not being raped.

03:36.731 --> 03:39.567
I just was trying to play
"Camptown Races."

03:39.601 --> 03:41.775
- It's not a toy.
- It is not.

03:42.904 --> 03:44.538
Dude, you need to
do something about Ken.

03:44.573 --> 03:46.240
He's a terrible security guard.

03:46.274 --> 03:48.275
He wasn't even here this morning
when the store got robbed.

03:48.310 --> 03:50.945
Yeah, look, I know he's not the best.

03:50.979 --> 03:54.215
But he is such a sweet man.

03:54.249 --> 03:56.083
Look, I know it sucks to fire somebody,

03:56.117 --> 03:58.118
but what's worse...
Waiting for some lunatic

03:58.153 --> 04:00.054
to come in here and kill a customer,

04:00.088 --> 04:02.452
or having an uncomfortable conversation?

04:07.028 --> 04:09.063
Security, report to Customer Service.

04:09.097 --> 04:11.799
- Security to Customer Service.
- Stop it.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.449
He's taking a selfie, Glenn.

04:14.769 --> 04:16.403
The dude's taking a selfie.

04:16.438 --> 04:21.642
My parking lot buddy is Jonah.
How is he gonna protect me?

04:22.201 --> 04:25.246
"Oh, stop. Don't attack us."

04:25.280 --> 04:27.114
I'm literally right here, Myrtle.

04:27.148 --> 04:28.482
Listen, her mind's mostly gone,

04:28.516 --> 04:29.485
but she raises a good point.

04:29.486 --> 04:32.419
You froze while a guy robbed the store.

04:32.454 --> 04:36.257
Okay, again, I didn't freeze.
He was being calm,

04:36.291 --> 04:39.326
so I was being calm.
The robber sets the tone.

04:39.361 --> 04:41.362
Oh, so are you just going to
be calm when a group

04:41.395 --> 04:43.905
of methed-out serial killers
stabs Myrtle to death

04:43.907 --> 04:44.701
in the parking lot?

04:44.702 --> 04:46.667
No, because that would be
a different tone.

04:46.701 --> 04:48.269
- Come on.
- Hey, everybody.

04:48.303 --> 04:49.770
Can I get you to meet me
in the break room

04:49.804 --> 04:50.974
for a quick chat?

04:51.840 --> 04:54.003
Is it about your boots?

04:54.004 --> 04:56.277
Uh, no.

04:56.311 --> 04:57.945
Um, it's about this morning's incident.

04:57.979 --> 05:00.424
Is that when you bought your boots?

05:01.316 --> 05:04.964
Just... if everybody would just
meet me in the break room.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:13.261 --> 05:15.229
Okay, so, I wanted to bring Dina up here

05:15.263 --> 05:17.398
so we could discuss
this morning's incident.

05:17.432 --> 05:20.234
Listen, I don't need an attaboy

05:20.268 --> 05:23.170
just for doing my job, okay?
But I do think it's positive

05:23.204 --> 05:26.307
that this can open a
conversation about self-defense

05:26.341 --> 05:27.975
and how each of us
need to take action...

05:28.009 --> 05:31.845
What I'm saying is,
don't do what Dina did.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.048
- Ooh.
- I'm sorry, what?

05:34.082 --> 05:36.083
He said, "Don't be like you."

05:36.117 --> 05:38.319
Dina took it upon herself to
physically confront the thief.

05:38.353 --> 05:40.087
And while it worked out okay this time,

05:40.121 --> 05:41.989
it could have turned into
serious injury, or death,

05:42.023 --> 05:43.482
or God forbid, a lawsuit.

05:44.559 --> 05:47.061
I'm obviously joking.
A lawsuit would not

05:47.095 --> 05:48.929
be as bad as death. The point is,

05:48.963 --> 05:50.931
we have a policy for this. So if you see

05:50.965 --> 05:52.766
something suspicious, report it.

05:52.767 --> 05:54.672
Don't try to handle it yourself.

05:54.673 --> 05:56.103
Yeah, we all know what the policy is,

05:56.137 --> 05:57.297
but what was I supposed to do?

05:57.298 --> 05:59.741
Just stand there and
make brown, like Jonah?

06:00.194 --> 06:01.339
What did Jonah do?

06:01.340 --> 06:03.410
Well, I didn't actually do anything...

06:03.445 --> 06:05.179
Exactly. He just sat there

06:05.213 --> 06:06.714
and watched a guy rob the store.

06:06.748 --> 06:08.248
Thank you. That is what you

06:08.283 --> 06:10.517
should all do in the future.

06:10.552 --> 06:13.921
Thank you, Jonah,
for actually following protocol.

06:13.955 --> 06:17.191
Oh, well, yeah. I mean, you know,

06:17.225 --> 06:18.692
you guys came up with the policy.

06:18.727 --> 06:20.527
I just knew it and followed it.

06:20.562 --> 06:21.929
- It's appreciated.
- Oh, my God,

06:21.963 --> 06:23.030
just sleep with him, already.

06:23.064 --> 06:24.231
- What?
- Okay,

06:24.265 --> 06:25.899
what if someone steals a baby?

06:25.934 --> 06:27.868
What then?
Do you want me to just sit there

06:27.902 --> 06:30.537
and watch someone take a baby?

06:30.572 --> 06:32.900
What if the baby is wearing a bomb?

06:32.901 --> 06:34.897
Then wouldn't you want him to steal it?

06:35.045 --> 06:36.661
I'm trying to picture
a scenario in which

06:36.662 --> 06:39.062
- somebody planted...
- Oh, what if it's baby Hitler?

06:39.077 --> 06:41.461
- Oh.
- That's a very good question.

06:41.462 --> 06:43.220
- Is it?
- I think you gotta kill

06:43.254 --> 06:45.021
- that baby Hitler.
- Yeah.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.692
But how would you know that
that baby was gonna grow up

06:46.693 --> 06:48.835
to be Hitler?
What if that baby was gonna

06:48.836 --> 06:51.677
grow up to be the exact
opposite of Hitler?

06:51.678 --> 06:53.247
- Churchill?
- No.

06:53.248 --> 06:55.820
- Lance Bass.
- Interesting.

06:55.821 --> 06:58.034
- Oprah.
- Yeah, Oprah.

06:58.069 --> 06:59.803
- Oh, yeah.
- Gotta save that baby.

06:59.837 --> 07:02.254
- Gotta save it.
- I'm more of an Ellen person.

07:04.918 --> 07:08.590
- It's fun when she dances.
- Anyway, what I'm saying is,

07:08.731 --> 07:11.775
don't be a Dina. Be a Jonah.

07:11.776 --> 07:13.303
- Oh. Different.
- Wow.

07:13.304 --> 07:16.374
Wait, you guys. What if it's baby Oprah,

07:16.375 --> 07:19.220
but the person stealing it is Beyoncé?

07:22.593 --> 07:24.461
I need a pen and paper.

07:28.319 --> 07:31.119
Ken, you...
You know how much I love you.

07:31.170 --> 07:32.521
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

07:32.556 --> 07:35.691
But a thief just wandered into
the store this morning.

07:35.726 --> 07:38.260
I know. Crazy, right?

07:38.295 --> 07:39.762
I just heard about that.

07:39.796 --> 07:43.995
And I hate to be such a Sally Stickler,

07:44.160 --> 07:47.169
but technically, you were
supposed to be here.

07:47.204 --> 07:49.772
Yes, yes. And I'm so sorry.

07:49.806 --> 07:51.741
You know, it just... it takes me forever

07:51.775 --> 07:53.209
to get going in the morning.

07:53.243 --> 07:55.277
'Cause I don't believe in alarm clocks.

07:55.312 --> 07:58.325
I like to wake up when my body
is ready, you know what I mean?

07:58.326 --> 08:01.917
But we've talked about this before.

08:02.671 --> 08:04.787
And I think it's time for you to go.

08:05.826 --> 08:08.891
- Oh.
- I'm so, so sorry.

08:08.925 --> 08:11.658
No, it's nothing to be sorry about.

08:12.395 --> 08:13.896
God bless.

08:18.001 --> 08:22.071
Jerusha, how was it? I feel sick!

08:22.105 --> 08:24.774
All right. Here you go.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.877
Hey, you know, you can just
take this stroller and leave,

08:27.911 --> 08:30.055
if you want. Just right out the store.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.741
This little girl won't try and stop you.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.692
- Ow, what are you doing?
- Just explaining that

08:34.731 --> 08:36.365
you're a sackless wuss
that would even let

08:36.399 --> 08:38.700
- this pipsqueak rob us.
- You know what?

08:38.735 --> 08:40.602
I'm just... I'm gonna go pay for it.

08:40.636 --> 08:43.337
- Yeah, enjoy that.
- Sorry. Congratulations.

08:43.371 --> 08:46.475
- What the hell was that?
- "What the hell was that?"

08:46.476 --> 08:47.988
I'm a little baby."

08:47.989 --> 08:49.832
Look, I can tell you're upset...

08:49.833 --> 08:52.014
- No, you can't.
- Okay, look,

08:52.048 --> 08:54.983
maybe, uh, Jeff calling you out
in the meeting this morning

08:55.018 --> 08:57.386
- was a little embarrassing...
- Uh, the only thing

08:57.420 --> 08:59.955
that's embarrassing is how far
Jeff is up your butt.

08:59.989 --> 09:01.490
Hello, Jeff? Are you in there?

09:01.524 --> 09:03.125
- Okay.
- Try not to scuff

09:03.159 --> 09:05.394
- your ridiculous boots.
- Oh, wow, right?

09:05.428 --> 09:08.597
- How insane...
- We are not on the same team.

09:11.464 --> 09:12.497
Hey.

09:14.058 --> 09:16.126
Oh, turkey sandwich.

09:16.372 --> 09:19.374
Hey, did you know that
the sandwich was invented

09:19.409 --> 09:22.691
- by the Earl of Sandwich?
- Okay.

09:23.746 --> 09:25.814
That's just a little
random fact that I knew.

09:25.848 --> 09:28.317
My head's full of all kinds
of things like that.

09:28.351 --> 09:30.819
- Who invented salad?
- Good question.

09:30.853 --> 09:32.588
I have another one.
Remember how we were just

09:32.622 --> 09:34.756
talking about turkey?
Which founding father

09:34.791 --> 09:38.026
wanted to make the turkey
our national bird?

09:38.061 --> 09:39.328
- Um...
- Huh?

09:39.362 --> 09:41.997
Anyone? Benjamin Franklin,

09:42.031 --> 09:44.433
who, as we all know, also
invented the Franklin Stove

09:44.467 --> 09:46.835
- and bifocals.
- Really?

09:46.869 --> 09:49.504
- I don't think that's true.
- Well, it is true.

09:49.539 --> 09:51.586
I know it's true because
I just looked it up.

09:51.587 --> 09:54.200
Okay.

09:54.201 --> 09:56.011
So did he invent salad?

09:56.045 --> 09:59.291
No. No, that was someone else.

10:05.655 --> 10:08.384
Ken? You're... you're here.

10:08.385 --> 10:09.829
Big time!

10:11.115 --> 10:14.463
Okay, um, look, maybe I wasn't clear,

10:14.497 --> 10:15.627
and that's my fault.

10:16.211 --> 10:18.764
But what I meant to say was,

10:19.936 --> 10:22.371
I don't want you to be
the security guard here anymore.

10:22.405 --> 10:25.707
Oh. So you're thinking

10:25.742 --> 10:27.776
move me over to what? Like, sales?

10:27.810 --> 10:29.578
- I wasn't...
- 'Cause I do think that

10:29.612 --> 10:32.147
would be a better fit
for my particular skill set.

10:32.181 --> 10:33.649
'Cause if I'm being honest with myself,

10:33.683 --> 10:35.550
I don't know anything about security.

10:35.585 --> 10:37.052
Okay. Okay.

10:37.086 --> 10:39.705
Yes, thanks. Yes, yes.

10:41.658 --> 10:43.592
Oh, hey, Jonah.
I just wanted to tell you,

10:43.626 --> 10:45.327
I really liked the way you
handled yourself this morning

10:45.361 --> 10:46.728
- with the robbery.
- Oh, thank you.

10:46.763 --> 10:48.797
Um, but that... that wasn't really...

10:48.831 --> 10:50.666
I get it. But it's just nice to know

10:50.700 --> 10:52.734
we've got some level-headed,
calm people working here.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.236
So good job.

10:54.270 --> 10:55.590
Uh, hey. Hey, um...

10:56.539 --> 10:59.410
You know what?
This... this might sound weird,

10:59.411 --> 11:03.982
but, um, could you not
compliment me in front of Dina?

11:04.881 --> 11:06.982
- I'm sorry?
- I appreciate everything

11:07.016 --> 11:08.850
that you're saying, but, um,

11:08.885 --> 11:12.254
I think Dina was a little
embarrassed about what happened

11:12.288 --> 11:14.856
this morning. And when
Dina gets embarrassed,

11:14.891 --> 11:18.264
- she can be a bit of a bully.
- Dina's bullying you?

11:18.265 --> 11:20.095
No, no. That's not what I...

11:20.129 --> 11:23.765
No, I just meant that she
can be a bit of a bully.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.447
Thank you for coming forward.

11:26.502 --> 11:27.564
I will talk to HR.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.074
No, no, no, no. You don't need

11:29.203 --> 11:31.004
to get HR involved. No.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.008
Okay, but you understand
you just informed me

11:33.042 --> 11:34.843
that a superior is bullying you.
Legally, that's something

11:34.877 --> 11:36.845
I have to report. We've just had

11:36.879 --> 11:38.213
too many suicides.

11:38.247 --> 11:39.852
Not necessary, no.

11:39.853 --> 11:43.222
Okay, I take no joy in getting
Dina in any kind of trouble.

11:43.256 --> 11:44.890
Really? 'Cause you're... you're smiling

11:44.925 --> 11:45.891
- a little.
- Am I?

11:46.730 --> 11:47.826
Huh.

11:52.641 --> 11:54.814
It's been brought to my
attention that there has been

11:54.815 --> 11:56.212
some bullying in the store.

11:56.213 --> 11:57.783
I have spoken to the person responsible,

11:57.818 --> 11:59.170
but I would like to remind everybody

11:59.171 --> 12:01.625
that Cloud 9 has a zero tolerance policy

12:01.626 --> 12:04.824
against bullying of anyone
under any circumstance.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.993
What if you're bullying Hitler?

12:07.027 --> 12:08.961
Bullying's probably
what made him Hitler.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.797
Actually, I think it was
not getting into art school.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.499
Okay, can we just forget about Hitler?

12:13.533 --> 12:16.335
No, we can't ever forget about Hitler.

12:16.370 --> 12:18.427
- She's right.
- Okay, I'm fine.

12:18.428 --> 12:20.473
- I was not bullied.
- Believe me,

12:20.507 --> 12:23.342
If I had bullied Jonah,
Justine wouldn't be the only one

12:23.377 --> 12:24.977
- with a broken nose.
- Heyo!

12:25.012 --> 12:27.146
Okay, bullying's not
just beating people up.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.649
It's... it's any behavior that's
hostile or intimidating.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.217
Like when your ex buys $300 boots,

12:31.251 --> 12:32.950
but all he got you on your
birthday was a cake

12:32.952 --> 12:33.707
from the store bakery?

12:33.708 --> 12:35.236
You said you didn't want anything.

12:35.237 --> 12:36.816
So, you know what, that doesn't matter.

12:36.817 --> 12:39.070
The point is, we all know
what bullying is;

12:39.071 --> 12:40.926
harassment, name-calling...

12:40.961 --> 12:43.729
Sometimes it seems like you're
calling someone a name

12:43.764 --> 12:45.765
but then it's their actual name.

12:45.799 --> 12:49.368
I once met a Greek guy named
Herpes, or something like that.

12:49.403 --> 12:53.072
- I thought you fired that dude.
- I did. Twice.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.289
Okay, so, what are some other examples?

12:55.453 --> 12:57.610
- Moron, A-hole...
- Bimbo.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.011
Bald jerk.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.946
Herpes when their name is not Herpes.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.050
- Va-Jonah.
- Opus Dei. Pasty freak.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.920
Okay, I meant other examples
of bullying, not name-calling.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.523
But nobody here should
be calling you those.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.525
Oh, no. That was just my doctors.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.527
How about being excluded socially?

13:14.561 --> 13:15.895
Sure, especially if they're

13:15.929 --> 13:17.697
purposely targeting an individual.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.099
What if it was more like
a group of people

13:19.108 --> 13:20.045
who were planning an event

13:20.046 --> 13:23.369
and they just weren't
inviting a specific person?

13:23.403 --> 13:26.605
Um, I think maybe what you're
describing is just a loser.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.941
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's a loser.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.777
A lot of interesting
opinions today, Kelly.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.080
- Thank you.
- Sometimes the bus driver

13:34.114 --> 13:36.382
opens the door and,
when I try to get in,

13:36.416 --> 13:39.385
he drives forward a little
and then I try to get in again,

13:39.419 --> 13:43.556
but then he drives a little more
and we're all laughing,

13:43.590 --> 13:45.140
but still...

13:46.860 --> 13:50.429
Yes, that is bullying, Sandra.

13:50.464 --> 13:53.733
Um... Jesus.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.912
Wow.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.581
You really got this firing thing down.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.583
I think he's gonna make
a fine associate.

14:10.617 --> 14:14.086
Stop. Ow, you're breaking my arm.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.489
Just trust me. It's gonna fit, okay?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.290
Stop fighting, man.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.360
- There you go.
- You're right, he's good.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.864
- Hey, hey.
- Ken.

14:24.898 --> 14:28.701
- Hey, it's the cool kids.
- Where?

14:28.735 --> 14:29.969
You. You're the...

14:30.003 --> 14:31.670
You're the cool kids.

14:31.705 --> 14:35.007
- Oh.
- So, um, any of you cats

14:35.041 --> 14:36.942
heading to this trivia thing tonight?

14:36.977 --> 14:40.346
Oh, no. None of us get invited to that.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.781
That thing is lame anyway.

14:41.815 --> 14:44.817
Hey, what if we did something?

14:44.851 --> 14:46.952
- Together?
- Yes.

14:46.987 --> 14:50.656
I always wanted to try that
bowling alley down the street.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.124
Yes! All right.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.527
Let's do it! Bowling night!

14:54.561 --> 14:56.028
I bet they have those wings,

14:56.062 --> 14:57.793
and they serve them with ranch dressing.

14:57.794 --> 14:59.331
Feels like you're British or something.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.233
Yeah. Maybe.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.170
I love bowling alleys. They're so dark,

15:04.204 --> 15:06.640
so you can make any kind
of faces you want.

15:07.892 --> 15:10.843
- Okay.
- What should our team name be?

15:10.877 --> 15:13.061
We should be the Best Friends.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.074
'Cause we are best friends.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.318
Wow. Yeah.

15:22.022 --> 15:26.425
Oh, darn it. I just remembered, um,

15:26.459 --> 15:28.760
Emma has a thing tonight.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.432
So...

15:31.364 --> 15:32.687
I can't.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.935
- Can we come?
- Oh.

15:35.969 --> 15:40.539
Um, oh. Uh, no.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.012
Hey, buddy. Guess what this is?

15:47.047 --> 15:49.114
It's my first write-up. Ever.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.850
So thank you so much for that.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.118
Look, I'm sorry.
I genuinely did not mean

15:53.153 --> 15:55.287
- to get you in trouble.
- Hey, it's all in the past.

15:55.322 --> 15:58.858
I just came over to ask you
in the most polite way possible

15:58.892 --> 16:01.694
to please clean up the
spill in aisle nine.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.028
Uh, this is aisle nine.

16:03.063 --> 16:06.599
Jesus! What is wrong with you?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.267
- Oops.
- You know what?

16:08.301 --> 16:10.620
I'm glad you got written up.
You are a bully.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.240
Well, I'd rather be a bully
than a castrated garden gnome.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.976
A garden gnome?
What would you even castrate?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.310
Well, who knows what's under
those little pants?

16:18.345 --> 16:20.112
That's not the point. The point is,

16:20.146 --> 16:23.048
at least I'm not too weak
to stop a simple robbery.

16:23.083 --> 16:26.719
That was an awkward situation.
I could have destroyed that guy.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.454
With muscles like those? Come on.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.423
I'm wiry because I work out
with resistance bands,

16:31.458 --> 16:33.726
but believe me.
They can get the job done.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.728
So, you think you could kick my ass?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.496
Your ass? Yeah, uh,

16:37.530 --> 16:39.164
obviously, I could... sure.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.799
Oh. Well, then come at me.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.301
- Come at you?
- Come at me!

16:42.335 --> 16:43.936
- Come at me, bro.
- What are you doing?

16:43.970 --> 16:45.604
- Oh, are you too scared?
- I'm not scared.

16:45.639 --> 16:46.672
I'm at work, and I don't wanna

16:46.706 --> 16:48.073
lose my job, Dina.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.775
Then let's take this thing off campus.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.176
- What?
- Fight!

16:51.211 --> 16:52.778
Fight, guys. Jonah's fighting Dina.

16:52.812 --> 16:56.415
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight...

16:56.449 --> 16:58.584
Guys, say it with me. It's so much fun.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.975
Fight, fight, fight...

17:02.122 --> 17:03.483
You guys are the worst.

17:07.242 --> 17:09.406
So what's the best case scenario, here?

17:09.738 --> 17:12.025
Dina beats you up,
or everyone gets to see

17:12.026 --> 17:14.019
- you hit a woman.
- It's not gonna come to that.

17:14.019 --> 17:15.587
Bullies just need to be confronted.

17:15.621 --> 17:18.656
There. Officially off Cloud 9 property.

17:18.691 --> 17:21.326
Now we're just a couple of civilians.

17:21.359 --> 17:23.694
- So show me what you got.
- Look, Dina, I'm not

17:23.729 --> 17:25.363
I'm not fighting you. This is...

17:25.396 --> 17:26.698
Why? Because I'm a woman?

17:26.732 --> 17:28.366
Because if you were really a feminist,

17:28.400 --> 17:29.650
you'd punch me in the face.

17:29.651 --> 17:32.170
What does that... Okay, what are you...

17:32.204 --> 17:33.872
What are you doing?
I'm not gonna do that.

17:33.906 --> 17:36.503
- It's been a long time coming.
- Wh-what?

17:36.976 --> 17:38.243
Since this morning.

17:38.277 --> 17:39.844
- I... I won't...
- Wait, guys.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.680
Just stop. This is crazy.

17:42.715 --> 17:44.849
- Thank you.
- Now we're good.

17:44.884 --> 17:46.584
Garrett, you don't need to...
You can turn it off,

17:46.619 --> 17:48.119
- because...
- Ooh!

17:48.154 --> 17:49.921
- Dina, what are you doing?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:49.955 --> 17:51.756
- Get him to the ground.
- Dina, I'm not gonna-

17:53.926 --> 17:56.361
- Hit him!
- Okay, all right.

17:56.395 --> 17:58.096
- Come on.
- Oh.

17:58.130 --> 18:00.698
Stop rolling. Your skin is very smooth,

18:00.733 --> 18:01.933
- like a dolphin.
- I don't wanna do this.

18:01.967 --> 18:03.034
- Just fight me.
- No.

18:03.068 --> 18:04.636
- Come on.
- Ow.

18:04.670 --> 18:06.037
- Fight me.
- Stop, Dina, get off.

18:06.071 --> 18:07.705
- Dina, get off!
- What the hell is that?

18:07.740 --> 18:09.487
- Nothing.
- What's wrong, man?

18:09.488 --> 18:10.874
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

18:10.910 --> 18:12.443
I'm good. I just... just gimme a minute.

18:12.478 --> 18:14.779
- Did you just get an erection?
- What? No.

18:14.813 --> 18:16.648
- No, no.
- He did, it's true.

18:16.682 --> 18:19.250
We got a boner, everyone.

18:19.285 --> 18:21.319
No, no, it's not. It's... the friction

18:21.353 --> 18:24.088
- from the pants are really soft.
- Boner. Boner. Boner. Boner.

18:24.819 --> 18:25.834
Really? None of you?

18:25.835 --> 18:28.393
Nice to get off early, huh?

18:29.078 --> 18:31.129
Have the whole night to do whatever?

18:31.163 --> 18:33.131
- Uh-huh.
- Totally.

18:33.165 --> 18:35.900
Like, maybe some laundry.
Oh, no, I did that yesterday.

18:35.935 --> 18:38.236
So, ugh, what to do?

18:38.270 --> 18:39.763
What to do?

18:40.839 --> 18:42.574
I'll see you guys over there.

18:42.608 --> 18:45.243
Let's get trivial!

18:45.277 --> 18:46.945
- All right.
- Whoo!

18:46.979 --> 18:50.081
Seriously? You guys invited that girl?

18:50.115 --> 18:52.417
I am way smarter than that girl.

18:52.451 --> 18:54.085
Okay, girl, what are you getting all

18:54.119 --> 18:55.787
- "Real Housewives" about?
- I'm talking about,

18:55.821 --> 18:57.355
why aren't you inviting me
to trivia night?

18:57.389 --> 18:59.123
'Cause we figured
you weren't interested.

18:59.158 --> 19:00.358
Why wouldn't I be interested?

19:00.392 --> 19:02.327
I love trivia. I love nights.

19:02.361 --> 19:04.329
You never wanna do anything after work.

19:04.363 --> 19:06.197
Yeah, you're always like, "No,"

19:06.232 --> 19:08.099
and then you did that weird,
like, sarcastic thing.

19:08.133 --> 19:09.834
Oh, like I would say no to trivia night.

19:09.868 --> 19:11.936
- You're doing it right now.
- Okay, that's beside the point.

19:11.971 --> 19:14.472
I said no because I was married
and I had Emma to look after.

19:14.506 --> 19:16.975
But now I'm separated and
Emma has her own thing,

19:17.009 --> 19:18.943
and I spend most of my nights by myself

19:18.978 --> 19:21.813
and I would really just like
to have a social life again.

19:21.847 --> 19:24.449
Okay, great. Just come to trivia night.

19:24.483 --> 19:26.884
- Okay, great.
- Great.

19:26.919 --> 19:28.119
I will. Thank you.

19:28.153 --> 19:29.954
Okay, we'll see you at 10.

19:29.989 --> 19:33.358
- Bye!
- Wait, uh, what... 10:00 p.m.?

19:33.392 --> 19:37.695
Who starts trivia at...
10:00 p.m. is an awesome time

19:37.730 --> 19:39.940
to start trivia. I love that idea.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.968
Maybe you'll get that
hard salad question.

19:44.003 --> 19:46.339
- Oh.
- Ooh.

19:48.507 --> 19:50.021
I'm so tired.

19:52.011 --> 19:55.277
- Hey.
- Uh, Dina, I really don't...

19:55.278 --> 19:57.315
Listen, I'm feeling
so stupid for not realizing

19:57.349 --> 19:59.083
why you've been messing with me so much.

19:59.118 --> 20:01.743
It's like a school boy
pulling your pigtails.

20:02.350 --> 20:04.735
- I'm sorry?
- You're still attracted to me.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.104
I get the message hard and clear.

20:07.726 --> 20:08.787
And hard.

20:09.728 --> 20:11.429
- Um...
- Here's the thing...

20:11.463 --> 20:13.865
It's terrible timing,
because I just ended this thing

20:13.899 --> 20:15.990
with Garrett, and I need to
lone wolf it for a while.

20:15.992 --> 20:17.269
Yeah, I feel like you're...

20:17.303 --> 20:20.171
You and I are just two ships
passing in the night.

20:20.205 --> 20:22.040
But that's not to say down
the road those two ships

20:22.074 --> 20:25.843
won't meet up in some harbor
and just drop anchor.

20:25.878 --> 20:28.613
- You know?
- It's a beautiful sentiment.

20:28.647 --> 20:30.782
- It is.
- Yeah.

20:30.816 --> 20:32.850
Oh, and speaking of ships,

20:33.441 --> 20:36.390
your mast... very impressive.

20:37.389 --> 20:38.639
Well done.

20:42.227 --> 20:46.130
Hey, parking lot buddy. Ready to
go wait at the bus stop with me?

20:46.165 --> 20:49.767
Oh, um, you know what,
I'm actually gonna catch up

20:49.802 --> 20:52.704
- with the trivia night guys.
- But you said it was lame.

20:52.738 --> 20:57.442
- Yeah, I did say that.
- Yeah.

20:57.969 --> 21:00.008
But you're good to walk alone, right?

21:00.505 --> 21:02.210
We'll start buddies tomorrow.

21:03.124 --> 21:03.852
Okay.

21:05.844 --> 21:07.292
It's just a little dark, but...

21:10.248 --> 21:12.132
and I don't know who that is.

21:13.305 --> 21:19.507
