02:54.830 --> 02:56.073
Lucy!

02:58.878 --> 03:00.933
Sweetheart, it's Daddy.

03:01.043 --> 03:02.308
Lucy?

03:02.333 --> 03:03.939
Sweetheart?

03:08.221 --> 03:11.838
Lucy? Lucy, it's Daddy, sweetheart.
Wake up, Lucy, come on!

03:11.838 --> 03:13.712
Lucy! Wake up!

03:15.845 --> 03:17.960
What the hell is this thing?

03:19.191 --> 03:20.970
How can I get this off you?

03:22.205 --> 03:26.428
If you move those, you'll kill her.

03:27.930 --> 03:29.314
You're lying.

03:29.431 --> 03:31.093
Perhaps.

03:31.287 --> 03:34.529
But is that a risk
you're willing to take?

07:32.208 --> 07:33.849
Vietnam.

09:01.488 --> 09:02.696
*Foreign language*

09:03.691 --> 09:05.570
*Foreign language*

10:06.944 --> 10:08.528
Hey, how you doing?

10:08.553 --> 10:10.777
- Screw you!
- Okay.

10:19.337 --> 10:20.972
It's your lucky day, man.

10:21.003 --> 10:23.020
Usually I don't give second chances.

10:23.064 --> 10:25.820
Here's the question.
Whose territory is this?

10:25.831 --> 10:28.090
I said screw you, pussy boy!

10:32.369 --> 10:34.674
*Unintelligible*

10:34.778 --> 10:37.415
What did you say?
I can't hear you.

10:37.615 --> 10:38.820
Louder!

10:38.820 --> 10:40.601
*Unintelligible*

10:42.314 --> 10:43.997
Whose territory?

10:45.984 --> 10:48.901
Master, Master Trahn's.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.890
That's right.
Master Trahn's territory.

10:52.206 --> 10:53.610
So why don't you go home,

10:53.610 --> 10:55.540
and tell you boss to pack up his villa,

10:55.540 --> 10:57.866
and his whores and get the hell out?

10:57.991 --> 11:01.147
Vietnam is closed for business.
You got that?

11:06.991 --> 11:07.989
Yeah?

11:07.989 --> 11:09.162
*Foreign language*

11:09.603 --> 11:10.631
Oh, yeah, it's done.

11:10.631 --> 11:11.538
*Foreign language*

11:12.553 --> 11:15.719
*Foreign language*

11:15.776 --> 11:17.267
Oh, I think they will.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.714
S- S- S-

12:04.218 --> 12:05.600
Sorry.

12:05.646 --> 12:07.138
Sorry.

12:07.503 --> 12:09.093
I- I'm...

12:09.276 --> 12:11.261
I- I- I'm...

12:13.132 --> 12:16.065
My... name... is...

12:22.141 --> 12:25.594
Can't remem...

12:26.042 --> 12:28.503
Remember my name.

12:31.819 --> 12:34.124
Can't remember my name.

12:36.315 --> 12:39.004
I can't remember anything.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.354
*Foreign language*

13:16.502 --> 13:17.883
No need.

13:18.033 --> 13:19.908
I can trust you.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.736
*Foreign language*

13:28.298 --> 13:31.478
*Foreign language*

13:31.819 --> 13:34.637
It's my last job... for anyone.

13:34.691 --> 13:36.486
What are you gonna do back in China?

13:36.486 --> 13:39.495
It's not like your Army buddies
want you back real soon.

13:39.690 --> 13:40.671
Yeah, well.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.449
There's no more fighting for me.

13:42.534 --> 13:44.264
My wife wants a noodle shop.

13:44.302 --> 13:46.851
Then go with that wife of yours. A cook?

13:46.908 --> 13:50.260
- I can't imagine that.
- No need to imagine that at all.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.402
*Foreign language*

13:57.696 --> 13:59.673
*Foreign language*

13:59.759 --> 14:02.894
*Foreign language*

14:02.949 --> 14:06.409
Master Trahn,
you don't need to apologise.

14:06.468 --> 14:07.729
For anything.

14:07.754 --> 14:09.946
I'm for ever in your debt.

14:33.657 --> 14:34.642
Er...

14:35.404 --> 14:37.858
Er... English?

14:54.247 --> 14:56.466
I-need-speak...?

14:56.491 --> 15:00.127
Eng- Engl...?

15:18.947 --> 15:21.557
- Br-British Emb...
- Go! Go! Go!

15:22.127 --> 15:23.205
Emb...!

15:25.309 --> 15:27.751
British Emb...

15:27.776 --> 15:29.493
British Emb...

15:31.745 --> 15:35.233
For God's sakes, lady!
I'm trying to find the British Embassy!

15:37.081 --> 15:39.628
The stutt... the stutter's gone.

15:39.692 --> 15:41.423
The stutter's gone!

15:42.357 --> 15:43.915
Thank you!

15:51.116 --> 15:52.494
Buh... buh... buh...

15:52.494 --> 15:53.928
*Foreign language*

15:54.133 --> 15:55.843
English!

16:19.895 --> 16:21.171
Hey, baby!

16:32.614 --> 16:34.317
Sorry I'm late.

16:38.691 --> 16:40.319
Where were you?

16:41.886 --> 16:43.802
Got a surprise for you.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.601
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.225
I went to the embassy.

17:00.029 --> 17:01.351
The embassy?

17:01.351 --> 17:03.068
Getting my passport back.

17:03.093 --> 17:04.601
We're going home.

17:06.903 --> 17:10.984
- Don't mess with my head.
- I'm not, I'm not... I promise you.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.297
I'm done.

17:13.753 --> 17:15.628
We get to go home.

17:26.604 --> 17:28.239
Thank you.

17:28.292 --> 17:29.928
I love you.

17:38.146 --> 17:39.568
What?

17:43.609 --> 17:47.229
- It's gonna wash up.
- It's not about the shirt.

17:49.337 --> 17:51.196
This was the last time.

17:51.933 --> 17:54.286
Like the last time?

17:55.467 --> 17:58.139
And like the last "last time?"

18:01.114 --> 18:02.972
Or like the one before that?

18:02.972 --> 18:04.626
But I'm done.
I'm done.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.774
Listen to me. I'm done. Trust me!
Maya, look!

18:09.349 --> 18:11.373
My final payment.

18:11.482 --> 18:14.522
It's gonna help us.
Start over.

18:14.995 --> 18:17.074
I don't need your blood money.

18:17.599 --> 18:19.008
Maya!

18:22.843 --> 18:24.348
I'm done!

18:25.326 --> 18:27.153
We... we can...!

18:29.198 --> 18:30.987
We can go home.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.907
Who are you?

20:23.707 --> 20:25.380
*Foreign language*

20:26.385 --> 20:27.780
*Foreign language*

20:32.068 --> 20:33.644
*Foreign language*

20:45.765 --> 20:47.373
S.. Sorry.

20:50.896 --> 20:52.071
English?

20:53.339 --> 20:54.484
*Foreign language*

20:54.939 --> 20:56.362
You got to go!

20:58.440 --> 21:00.350
British Embassy?

21:00.350 --> 21:01.961
*Foreign language*

22:18.705 --> 22:20.432
Connor!

22:28.917 --> 22:30.563
Connor!

22:33.510 --> 22:34.972
Connor!

22:59.163 --> 23:00.694
Maya?

23:40.963 --> 23:41.963
Yeah?

23:41.988 --> 23:43.512
You're still in town?

23:45.256 --> 23:46.770
Not for long.

23:47.272 --> 23:48.454
Why?

23:48.479 --> 23:50.379
Well, you better get the hell out, man.

23:50.379 --> 23:53.134
'Cos Pop just heard the Russians
might pay you a visit.

23:54.029 --> 23:55.947
I think they already have.

23:56.276 --> 23:58.277
I thought it was a nightmare but...

23:58.372 --> 24:01.497
- What? What are you talking about?
- Hey, Sonny...

24:02.761 --> 24:04.774
How do you think they
found out where I lived?

24:04.799 --> 24:07.876
Well, I don't know.
Maybe they followed you home?

24:08.917 --> 24:11.598
Yeah, that's probably it.

24:53.828 --> 24:54.926
Go!

24:58.030 --> 25:00.567
He's on the move!
North stairs, North stairs!

25:00.592 --> 25:01.592
All right!

25:01.875 --> 25:03.986
We're on our way!
*Foreign language*

25:06.355 --> 25:08.963
<i>We got him, boss.
Just a few more minutes.</i>

25:08.988 --> 25:10.433
And remember, boys...

25:10.458 --> 25:13.346
Big bonus if you bring him to me alive.

26:04.729 --> 26:05.791
Follow him!

26:08.102 --> 26:10.155
<i>What is going on?
Do you have him?</i>

26:10.155 --> 26:11.526
Working on it.

27:37.076 --> 27:38.624
Drop it!

27:40.144 --> 27:42.709
Drop it or I'll blow your brains out.

27:42.821 --> 27:44.247
Take it easy.

27:44.272 --> 27:45.712
Just take it easy.

27:47.180 --> 27:49.213
On the ground. Now!

27:50.089 --> 27:51.416
Good boy!

27:52.354 --> 27:53.491
Hey, boss?

27:53.491 --> 27:54.842
It's Andrei.

27:55.043 --> 27:57.300
I think I'll take that bonus.

28:00.885 --> 28:02.072
*Foreign language*

28:03.126 --> 28:07.150
So... you are Master Trahn's bloodhound.

28:09.159 --> 28:12.380
I just want some tea... some snacks?

28:13.318 --> 28:15.287
No one said you can talk!

28:18.344 --> 28:21.445
I see you boss has put a big price...

28:21.470 --> 28:23.790
on the heads of my men.

28:24.275 --> 28:27.300
Smart to set up the place, Andrei,
*Foreign language*

28:27.630 --> 28:28.793
Genious.

28:30.712 --> 28:33.884
You are still breathing for one reason,

28:34.087 --> 28:36.477
and one reason only.

28:36.593 --> 28:38.985
I want to make an example of you.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.654
The question is...

28:41.566 --> 28:43.995
How precisely?

28:46.074 --> 28:47.976
The question is...

28:49.504 --> 28:51.500
Where's my wife?

28:52.241 --> 28:53.503
Your wife?

28:53.588 --> 28:55.734
How the fuck should I know?

28:58.579 --> 28:59.891
You don't know?

28:59.891 --> 29:02.538
If I knew you had a wife,
it would be there.

29:02.561 --> 29:06.117
On your bed...
entertaining my men right now.

29:12.038 --> 29:13.212
Okay.

29:13.968 --> 29:15.749
I believe you.

29:16.216 --> 29:17.983
Because you think you have me.

29:22.979 --> 29:24.443
You have balls.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.174
I'll give you that.

29:26.623 --> 29:27.838
But now...

29:27.863 --> 29:30.459
it's time to teach you a lesson.

29:31.153 --> 29:32.707
Here's the lesson.

29:33.410 --> 29:35.956
You should've shot me
when you had the chance.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.965
How's that for entertaining,
you dumb fuck?

30:42.203 --> 30:45.743
*Foreign language*

31:05.179 --> 31:07.483
*Foreign language*

31:18.429 --> 31:20.436
<i>I love you, Daddy!</i>

31:23.752 --> 31:24.848
Lucy.

31:26.213 --> 31:27.338
Lucy.

31:28.002 --> 31:30.792
Wow! Good morning, Vietnam!

31:33.244 --> 31:36.032
My... my daught...

31:38.098 --> 31:41.965
Please, I need to talk to the police.

31:42.322 --> 31:43.674
What's he saying?

31:43.847 --> 31:46.331
He needs to talk to the police!

31:46.629 --> 31:49.590
Looks like the police already
talked to you... plenty!

31:50.494 --> 31:52.557
- Give it to me.
- I can't!

31:52.557 --> 31:54.699
- It's evidence!
- It's mine!

32:03.690 --> 32:04.690
Help!

32:19.110 --> 32:21.338
What the hell is going on here?

32:21.634 --> 32:23.050
Morning, doctor!

32:23.050 --> 32:25.066
Just another lovely day on the job!

32:25.091 --> 32:26.318
Who is this?

32:26.318 --> 32:28.156
Extremely violent.

32:28.181 --> 32:30.622
No papers, no memory...

32:30.739 --> 32:34.409
Hey, maybe no girlfriend,
so it could be your lucky day.

32:36.094 --> 32:37.485
A Westerner.

32:37.614 --> 32:39.475
Get him a clean private room.

32:39.475 --> 32:43.106
Compresses every hour to lower
the swelling on his face.

32:43.131 --> 32:46.123
We'll be dealing with
the government people soon enough.

32:46.148 --> 32:48.044
And I don't want any trouble.

32:48.044 --> 32:50.267
I'll see him when he wakes up.

32:51.829 --> 32:53.529
She likes him.

32:55.604 --> 32:57.824
The Russians were telling the truth.

33:02.332 --> 33:03.917
They didn't take Maya,

33:03.948 --> 33:05.736
He thought I was done for.

33:05.864 --> 33:08.020
If anything he'd be bragging about it.

33:08.970 --> 33:10.304
*Foreign language*

33:10.819 --> 33:12.889
*Foreign language*

33:13.134 --> 33:15.157
*Foreign language*

33:15.656 --> 33:17.812
That's a good question.

33:20.564 --> 33:22.806
Maybe it was your old Army buddies,

33:22.806 --> 33:24.634
Maybe they don't want you back home.

33:25.475 --> 33:28.640
Weren't you like the most
honest guy in your unit?

33:28.705 --> 33:30.646
That's why you left, right?
So, they probably thought...

33:30.671 --> 33:31.968
"Hey, we got a deal."

33:31.968 --> 33:33.629
You might rat them out.

33:33.702 --> 33:35.463
That doesn't make any sense.

33:35.761 --> 33:38.159
They're not smart,
they're not organized...

33:38.362 --> 33:40.714
Half of them are dead,
the other half in jail.

*Foreign language*

33:48.230 --> 33:50.277
*Foreign language*

33:54.703 --> 33:56.631
She wouldn't have just left.

33:56.656 --> 33:58.014
Not like that.

33:58.763 --> 34:00.610
*Foreign language*

34:01.756 --> 34:04.370
*Foreign language*

34:04.730 --> 34:06.480

34:11.371 --> 34:13.079
Thank you, Master Trahn.

34:25.965 --> 34:27.815
*Foreign language*

34:30.016 --> 34:32.281
Don't worry, it's almost over.

34:37.280 --> 34:40.280

34:44.132 --> 34:45.484
<i>*Foreign language*</i>

34:45.726 --> 34:47.710
<i>*Foreign language*</i>

34:48.554 --> 34:50.261
I'm sorry but she's the key!

34:50.261 --> 34:54.141
It's her DNA that matches and they
pay well for that database, okay?

34:54.664 --> 34:56.279
*Foreign language*

34:56.554 --> 34:58.828
*Foreign language*

34:59.437 --> 35:01.640
They gave us 20 million in diamonds.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.877
Twenty million!

35:02.877 --> 35:04.927
*Foreign language*

35:04.977 --> 35:06.384
Well, these are not...!

35:06.764 --> 35:09.693
People that you could just refuse!

35:10.779 --> 35:12.345
*Foreign language*

35:12.443 --> 35:14.045
*Foreign language*

35:14.045 --> 35:16.229
Just one last trade, okay?

35:16.292 --> 35:18.676
We're gonna deliver the artefact.

35:18.916 --> 35:21.008
And then we're done, okay?

36:06.693 --> 36:09.992
So far you've told t0he police
you have no memory.

36:10.378 --> 36:12.896
It's coming back.

36:13.151 --> 36:14.446
Slowly,

36:14.471 --> 36:19.776
but I still have no idea how
I ended up in  bloody V... V...

36:20.491 --> 36:22.061
Vietnam.

36:27.140 --> 36:29.759
The last thing I can remember clearly,

36:29.759 --> 36:31.438
is coming out of the water,

36:31.438 --> 36:34.746
at V... V... V...

36:34.837 --> 36:36.744
Victory Fountain Park!

36:36.744 --> 36:38.762
Victory Fountain Park.

36:38.762 --> 36:41.812
Sorry. It helps with the...

36:41.812 --> 36:43.028
stutter.

36:43.028 --> 36:45.154
Victory Fountain Park?

36:45.154 --> 36:46.300
Yeah.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.607
And you mentioned
you were trapped there.

36:50.607 --> 36:52.216
What do you mean by that?

36:52.216 --> 36:54.231
I don't even know if I can explain it.

36:54.231 --> 36:56.993
Alright? But one minute
I can see the exit.

36:56.993 --> 36:58.759
I can see it, it was right there,

36:58.759 --> 37:00.773
and then the next moment...

37:02.160 --> 37:03.606
I was lost again.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.657
I was walking around in circles.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.448
There's no way to explain it.

37:08.448 --> 37:10.147
Okay? There is something

37:10.147 --> 37:15.732
re-really m-m-messed up
about that place, it is.

37:17.731 --> 37:19.380
And you told the
police you would help

37:19.405 --> 37:21.667
with these people who
kidnapped your daughter.

37:21.667 --> 37:22.846
Lucy.

37:22.944 --> 37:25.424
The longer I spend away from that place,

37:25.424 --> 37:28.414
the m-m-more I can remember but,

37:28.782 --> 37:31.438
they did something to me in there.

37:31.438 --> 37:33.829
This stutter and...

37:33.829 --> 37:35.076
you know, t-t-the...

37:35.076 --> 37:36.076
ticks and...

37:36.101 --> 37:39.552
M-m-m-my...

37:39.552 --> 37:44.287
M-m-m-my memory!
My memory.

38:22.272 --> 38:23.312
Look.

38:23.362 --> 38:26.003
I know my story sounds
pretty crazy, right?

38:26.058 --> 38:27.697
And obviously I'm...

38:27.837 --> 38:29.500
not in the best of shape at the moment

38:29.525 --> 38:32.009
but you could actually check
for yourself if you want because

38:32.009 --> 38:35.105
my daughter, she went missing
just over two weeks ago

38:35.105 --> 38:38.625
but we made the papers last Friday now.

38:38.625 --> 38:40.564
You probably don't have
the papers here but

38:40.564 --> 38:43.761
I could probably get someone
to fax you the articles if...

38:43.761 --> 38:46.200
I... can I use that phone?

38:47.539 --> 38:50.168
It's all right. I can do it myself.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.389
Okay, look, she went missing

38:52.405 --> 38:55.897
the morning of January 1st,
New Years Day.

38:59.445 --> 39:00.716
Andrew.

39:01.222 --> 39:03.267
I'm going to help you.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.722
Thank you.

39:54.555 --> 39:56.047
I have it.

40:10.853 --> 40:12.725
My final payment.

41:31.810 --> 41:34.363
Oh, wait, wait, you still owe me.

41:38.506 --> 41:39.961
For the woman.

41:52.627 --> 41:54.205
No, not diamonds.

41:54.669 --> 41:56.724
You know what I need.

43:24.058 --> 43:26.566
Our business is concluded.

43:29.282 --> 43:31.774
Thank you!
Thank you!

43:31.877 --> 43:33.023
Hey!

43:34.544 --> 43:36.106
Where's my wife?

43:36.862 --> 43:38.760
I'm not gonna ask again.

43:39.940 --> 43:42.313
Sonny, you tell this
asshole I'm serious.

45:05.978 --> 45:07.417
Holy shit!

45:15.389 --> 45:16.569
Wait, wait, wait!

45:17.979 --> 45:19.787
Where do you think you're going?

45:29.288 --> 45:31.270
There you are.

45:36.232 --> 45:38.313
Aliens. Of course.

46:14.870 --> 46:16.521
What the fuck, man?

46:18.687 --> 46:19.868
Let me go.

46:23.538 --> 46:24.902
Where's my wife?

46:27.048 --> 46:28.551
You fucking moron.

46:28.551 --> 46:29.996
You're already dead.

46:30.021 --> 46:32.643
When my father gets here, he's...

46:32.718 --> 46:34.529
Your father's next.

46:34.851 --> 46:36.378
I heard everything.

46:37.297 --> 46:38.728
You wouldn't dare!

46:41.888 --> 46:43.025
That was your rib.

46:43.558 --> 46:45.937
- I'm gonna keep going...
- No, no, no, no!

46:45.937 --> 46:47.301
No, no!

46:48.157 --> 46:49.997
You don't understand, man!

46:50.065 --> 46:53.148
You saw what they could do.
It's not like we had a choice!

46:53.517 --> 46:55.047
You could have warned me.

46:55.620 --> 46:57.444
But you wanted your diamonds.

46:59.038 --> 47:00.175
And your new arm.

47:00.175 --> 47:02.546
No, no, you don't understand, man.

47:02.546 --> 47:04.342
I saw them, I...

47:04.367 --> 47:09.565
I... saw them... eat...
Quan, my cousin.

47:09.636 --> 47:12.189
Remember how we told everyone
it was the Russians that got him?

47:12.214 --> 47:14.654
It wasn't the Russians!
It was the...

47:14.728 --> 47:16.504
These things!

47:16.610 --> 47:18.526
He tried to screw them over
and they tore him...

47:18.526 --> 47:20.258
apart from limb to limb.

47:20.258 --> 47:22.644
And ate him like it was chicken.

47:22.669 --> 47:24.640
Who? What are they?

47:24.745 --> 47:27.033
Aliens? Monsters?
I don't know, man.

47:27.058 --> 47:28.985
They're not from around here.

47:29.023 --> 47:30.785
And I don't mean Vietnam.

47:32.657 --> 47:34.301
No, what you doing?

47:34.454 --> 47:35.988
I'm just gonna cut your arm off.

47:35.988 --> 47:37.115
Maybe you'll take me seriously.

47:37.115 --> 47:39.329
No, no, no, no, no...!

47:39.329 --> 47:42.380
- Where's my wife?!
- I don't know, I don't know...

47:42.380 --> 47:44.584
I don't know.
She's got something on the list.

47:44.584 --> 47:45.544
What list?

47:45.544 --> 47:49.594
Some database. They want people
with specific genetic codes.

47:49.594 --> 47:50.770
What codes?

47:50.770 --> 47:51.903
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

47:51.903 --> 47:54.621
They just wanted people
with a specific DNA sequence.

47:54.621 --> 47:56.299
Your wife just matched.

47:56.299 --> 47:58.726
It was just unlucky, okay?
It was just unlucky.

47:58.797 --> 47:59.908
Unlucky?

48:04.690 --> 48:06.273
Where do I find them?

48:09.384 --> 48:12.257
I think Victory Fountain Park.

48:17.288 --> 48:19.271
You tell me how to get there.

48:19.351 --> 48:22.859
It's on any map, man.
It's North of the city.

48:22.864 --> 48:26.771
You know the Chong District?
You just keep going North.

48:32.618 --> 48:35.067
Did you manage to speak to the embassy?

48:35.544 --> 48:38.229
Yes, I called them myself.

48:38.254 --> 48:40.956
Someone will be here in a few hours.

48:42.049 --> 48:43.243
Thank you.

48:43.480 --> 48:45.834
I also found the newspaper articles.

48:45.834 --> 48:47.003
Oh, yeah?

48:47.308 --> 48:49.518
And I have a question for you.

48:52.222 --> 48:53.299
Go on.

48:56.942 --> 48:58.923
What year is this?

48:59.455 --> 49:00.842
I'm sorry, what?

49:01.467 --> 49:03.689
What year do you think it is?

49:03.689 --> 49:05.740
It's 1985. Why?

49:08.228 --> 49:10.170
What year do you think it is?

49:12.261 --> 49:13.788
- 2018.

49:19.154 --> 49:22.932
- 2018... you mean like 2018, yeah?

49:27.898 --> 49:30.522
- 2018? Why, why not?

49:30.699 --> 49:32.384
Yeah? It makes sense to me.

49:32.384 --> 49:37.063
I mean, if they can w-w-warp space,
they can probably w-w-warp time as well.

49:37.136 --> 49:39.086
That's how they managed to
stay hidden for so long!

49:39.111 --> 49:40.123
Who?

49:40.977 --> 49:43.721
You need to get me out of here, doc.
You need to get me out of here.

49:43.721 --> 49:47.059
- They've got my daughter!
- I'm sorry. I can't do that.

49:48.203 --> 49:49.624
And you're hurting me.

49:51.068 --> 49:53.521
S-sorry, sorry.

49:54.022 --> 49:55.294
I just...

49:57.158 --> 49:59.063
Look, it doesn't matter anyway, does it?

49:59.172 --> 50:02.035
In a few hours I'm not gonna be
your problem anymore.

50:27.911 --> 50:29.673
<i>You lied to me!</i>

50:33.404 --> 50:36.730
<i>What is it you actually do
for nice old Master Trahn?</i>

50:36.755 --> 50:38.678
<i>- Maya...
- I married a hero!</i>

50:38.808 --> 50:40.508
<i>Not a gangster.</i>

50:40.533 --> 50:42.127
<i>Get out!</i>

50:57.515 --> 51:00.171
The thing is he really believes it.

51:00.171 --> 51:01.504
They all do!

51:01.504 --> 51:03.375
Surely my best student knows that.

51:03.375 --> 51:04.540
Of course but...

51:05.763 --> 51:08.329
- Never mind.
- What is it?

51:08.354 --> 51:10.274
What's bothering you?

51:12.765 --> 51:15.493
The photos.
He looks exactly the same.

51:15.493 --> 51:17.733
It's been over 30 years.

51:17.758 --> 51:19.965
Shouldn't he look a lot older?

51:20.971 --> 51:25.367
Maybe it's his father
and the girl his sister.

51:25.799 --> 51:28.076
He took his father's identity

51:28.101 --> 51:30.369
to try and escape the pain.

51:30.369 --> 51:34.801
Anna, it is a classic
case of transference.

51:34.826 --> 51:36.712
You should know that!

51:37.624 --> 51:38.648
What?

51:38.673 --> 51:41.768
I'm almost sorry I called
the British embassy for him.

51:41.845 --> 51:44.876
I could have treated him myself
and written a book.

51:44.901 --> 51:46.974
Oh, you can do better than that.

51:46.974 --> 51:48.889
Aliens are so cliché.

51:49.074 --> 51:52.039
My drunken son in law swears...

51:52.039 --> 51:56.110
he saw a UFO above
the park near Chinatown.

51:57.580 --> 52:00.296
Park? What park?

52:00.511 --> 52:03.043
Oh, I don't know, it's...

52:03.443 --> 52:05.929
Oh, it's the one with a fountain.

52:05.994 --> 52:08.497
Victory Fountain Park.

52:51.474 --> 52:56.474

53:48.942 --> 53:50.325
Are you all right?

53:52.206 --> 53:54.202
How did you...?

53:55.099 --> 53:56.546
I don't know.

53:57.207 --> 53:59.613
I don't know what you think you saw.

54:01.045 --> 54:02.797
But this place...

54:06.576 --> 54:08.842
This place...

54:11.207 --> 54:12.619
What time is it?

54:13.177 --> 54:14.576
D'you have the time?

54:17.643 --> 54:18.691
What?!

54:20.196 --> 54:21.740
I've been here longer!

54:21.887 --> 54:24.098
I've been here longer than that!

54:24.329 --> 54:27.205
Hey, can I call someone for you?

54:27.890 --> 54:28.953
No.

54:29.709 --> 54:32.389
I'm... I'm...

54:33.050 --> 54:34.862
I'm looking for my wife.

54:34.958 --> 54:36.191
Your wife?

54:36.378 --> 54:38.591
Is she here with you?

54:38.999 --> 54:40.593
She's been...

54:41.755 --> 54:44.060
She's been abducted.

54:44.199 --> 54:45.674
Abducted?

54:45.674 --> 54:47.159
What do you mean?

54:47.202 --> 54:49.937
- By whom?
- These people.

54:50.543 --> 54:51.938
These...

54:52.997 --> 54:54.429
These...

54:58.428 --> 55:00.034
What are you looking at?

55:02.843 --> 55:04.407
Do you see that?

55:05.011 --> 55:06.011
Yeah?

55:08.289 --> 55:10.029
See that tree?

55:10.029 --> 55:13.202
- We are walking towards it, right?
- Yeah.

55:16.170 --> 55:18.809
Why aren't we getting any closer?

55:31.849 --> 55:34.654
How... how is that possible?

55:39.306 --> 55:40.931
I don't know.

55:45.614 --> 55:48.005
There's something else I wanna show you.

55:48.630 --> 55:50.342
Let me see your phone.

55:52.235 --> 55:54.006
Just hold it.

55:56.526 --> 55:58.529
What? I don't...

55:58.529 --> 56:00.015
Tilt it up!

56:05.462 --> 56:08.275
What is that?
An optical illusion?

56:08.487 --> 56:11.791
It's this place.
It's all messed up.

56:12.076 --> 56:15.896
There more you interact with it,
the more it messes you up.

56:15.958 --> 56:19.700
<i>There is something really
messed up about that place.</i>

56:20.011 --> 56:22.386
There's someone you need to meet.

56:22.958 --> 56:24.278
I'll drive.

56:52.871 --> 56:54.153
Hey there.

56:54.215 --> 56:55.573
He's with me.

56:55.751 --> 56:57.464
How's our British doing?

56:57.464 --> 57:00.251
He's fine.
The embassy people just showed up.

57:00.493 --> 57:02.313
The British Embassy?

57:02.901 --> 57:04.977
Yeah, two big guys.

57:05.031 --> 57:07.354
Bao took them to the conference room 2.

57:17.821 --> 57:19.661
Thank you so much for coming.

58:17.645 --> 58:19.337
Andrew, look out!

58:21.776 --> 58:23.294
What the...?

59:58.442 --> 01:00:00.663
I guess they are not from the embassy.

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:03.149
They're not from any
embassy around here.

01:00:07.279 --> 01:00:09.046
Who is this guy?

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:13.771
Anna, Anna, come on.
You need to get me out of here, alright?

01:00:13.771 --> 01:00:15.945
It's only a matter of time before
those things come back here.

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:17.226
You mean the aliens?

01:00:17.226 --> 01:00:18.997
I can't believe I'm saying this!

01:00:19.022 --> 01:00:21.095
I should have my head examined.

01:00:22.258 --> 01:00:24.409
Look, they're not aliens, alright?

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:26.856
I call them drones.

01:00:26.881 --> 01:00:29.676
They're humans that are
controlled by the aliens

01:00:29.676 --> 01:00:32.748
through those spider things
in the back of their necks.

01:00:32.748 --> 01:00:34.991
Why didn't he die?
You shot him in the head!

01:00:34.991 --> 01:00:36.767
Yeah, you shoot him in the head,
you can shoot him in the leg,

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:38.757
shoot him in the arm,
it doesn't really matter, alright?

01:00:38.758 --> 01:00:41.129
The only thing you can do is...

01:00:41.129 --> 01:00:43.410
to pull those spiders out to
stop the motor functioning.

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:46.089
Where do I find them?
They have my wife.

01:00:47.026 --> 01:00:50.071
I don't know. I guess we could
go back to the park, right?

01:00:50.071 --> 01:00:52.829
I mean... that's the only clue I've got!

01:01:14.969 --> 01:01:16.938
What the hell?

01:01:31.937 --> 01:01:33.711
Okay! That's as far as you go!

01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:35.507
I'm sorry. You can't come in here.

01:01:35.507 --> 01:01:36.641
What's going on here?

01:01:36.641 --> 01:01:38.145
This area is restricted.

01:01:38.145 --> 01:01:39.817
There was a gas explosion.

01:01:39.842 --> 01:01:41.892
- It's not safe.
- Gas explosion?

01:01:41.892 --> 01:01:43.265
In the middle of a park?

01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:44.493
There were pipes underneath.

01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:46.563
- What are you talking about? Let me
have a look... - Hey, stop! Stop!

01:01:46.563 --> 01:01:49.592
- Let me have a look! - Stop!
- You can't come! -I'm very sorry!

01:01:49.592 --> 01:01:52.190
Sorry, Officer.
We are just about to leave.

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:53.257
Sorry! Sorry!

01:01:53.257 --> 01:01:56.284
- What are you talking about
gas explosion? - Let's go!

01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:01.019
What's he talking about gas explosion?

01:02:01.019 --> 01:02:02.459
More like a meteorite hit.

01:02:02.459 --> 01:02:04.407
They're smart fuckers, aren't they?

01:02:04.419 --> 01:02:06.981
They knew we'd find one of their entry
points so they've shut it down.

01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:08.400
Yeah? Now what do we do?

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.263
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:02:10.263 --> 01:02:11.464
My wife's in there!

01:02:11.464 --> 01:02:14.507
Yeah, my kid's in there as well
but I don't know, do I?

01:02:14.671 --> 01:02:16.543
Let's get out of here.

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:23.063
Six, five...

01:02:23.063 --> 01:02:25.286
Four, three...

01:02:25.286 --> 01:02:27.388
Two... one.

01:02:27.461 --> 01:02:32.528
And you are now asleep
but you can still hear my voice.

01:02:33.684 --> 01:02:36.067
Think back to Lucy.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.457
Daddy!

01:02:45.487 --> 01:02:49.003
Now, think back to
when she went missing.

01:02:57.753 --> 01:02:59.196
I can't!

01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:01.387
Yes, you can!

01:03:01.412 --> 01:03:03.331
This is your mind!

01:03:03.356 --> 01:03:05.022
You control it.

01:03:05.819 --> 01:03:07.618
You can remember.

01:03:07.669 --> 01:03:09.232
Lucy?

01:03:13.919 --> 01:03:15.421
You can do it!

01:03:19.482 --> 01:03:20.880
They're not letting me!

01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:29.470
You are safe.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:30.989
You are with me.

01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:35.397
I'll keep you safe.

01:03:38.045 --> 01:03:39.562
Just relax.

01:03:39.587 --> 01:03:41.101
Relax!

01:03:43.506 --> 01:03:45.502
Let's use a safe word.

01:03:45.664 --> 01:03:48.172
When you hear the word "Lucy..."

01:03:48.218 --> 01:03:51.853
You are going to wake up refreshed.
You got it?

01:03:52.274 --> 01:03:53.984
Okay.

01:04:01.392 --> 01:04:03.190
Let's try again.

01:04:05.023 --> 01:04:06.984
I searched.

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:09.454
I didn't sleep for days.

01:04:11.169 --> 01:04:13.651
I searched everywhere for her.

01:04:15.111 --> 01:04:16.356
She was gone.

01:04:16.434 --> 01:04:19.298
It's like she just
vanished into thin air.

01:04:23.501 --> 01:04:24.812
The police.

01:04:24.812 --> 01:04:26.757
They were no help.

01:04:27.878 --> 01:04:30.277
Every time I went to her room...

01:04:30.354 --> 01:04:33.283
I don't know,
it was like I was feeling this...

01:04:34.546 --> 01:04:37.273
intense nausea.

01:04:38.349 --> 01:04:40.631
That happened to me to.

01:04:43.445 --> 01:04:45.945
They tried to tell me
it was mental but it wasn't.

01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:49.509
There was something physically

01:04:49.555 --> 01:04:52.233
wrong with that space.

01:04:52.516 --> 01:04:54.735
I'm sure of it.

01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:57.971
One day I... I found him.

01:04:58.036 --> 01:05:01.070
I finally found someone who believed me.

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:06.325
He was a doctor.

01:05:07.801 --> 01:05:09.962
I just can't remember his name.

01:05:16.557 --> 01:05:19.269
Relax! Who did you find?

01:05:20.352 --> 01:05:21.703
I can't!

01:05:28.728 --> 01:05:31.245
<i>I'm talking about other dimensions.</i>

01:05:32.151 --> 01:05:34.027
Other planes of existence.

01:05:38.645 --> 01:05:40.920
Who did you find?
Who believed you?

01:05:40.944 --> 01:05:43.437
He was a doctor!

01:05:45.637 --> 01:05:47.508
Fight it, Andrew.
Fight it.

01:05:47.545 --> 01:05:48.644
Shut up!

01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:51.041
He knows where my wife is.
I need to know!

01:05:52.689 --> 01:05:54.220
Who did you find?

01:05:54.337 --> 01:05:55.861
Who believed you?

01:05:57.239 --> 01:05:58.385
Lucy!

01:05:58.418 --> 01:05:59.925
Lucy!

01:06:12.277 --> 01:06:13.676
Are you okay?

01:06:13.859 --> 01:06:15.285
Gong.

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.663
What?

01:06:18.186 --> 01:06:19.938
I talked to Gong.

01:06:20.832 --> 01:06:22.688
I spoke to him on the phone.

01:06:22.713 --> 01:06:24.687
He's the only one who believed me.

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:26.800
He knew all my symptoms.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.245
Everything about Lucy's disappearance
before I even said it.

01:06:33.279 --> 01:06:36.396
Dr. Jiao Gong.

01:06:36.477 --> 01:06:39.947
Jiao Gong. A Chinese scientist.

01:06:39.947 --> 01:06:42.646
He lived around here
in Ho Chi Minh City.

01:06:45.146 --> 01:06:46.990
We have to find him.

01:06:57.865 --> 01:06:59.147
Dr. Gong!

01:07:00.623 --> 01:07:01.846
Never heard of him.

01:07:01.846 --> 01:07:04.758
Dr. Gong. My name is Andrew Quinn.
I'm from London.

01:07:04.758 --> 01:07:05.830
You remember me?

01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:07.003
You have the wrong person.

01:07:07.003 --> 01:07:10.678
No, I don't. We've met before.
30 years ago.

01:07:11.392 --> 01:07:13.636
But to me it feels like three days.

01:07:14.408 --> 01:07:15.771
They have my daughter.

01:07:15.802 --> 01:07:17.468
They have my wife.

01:07:18.658 --> 01:07:20.229
Please.

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:25.006
Come on.

01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:30.177
What most people don't realize
is the whole concept of Feng Shui,

01:07:30.177 --> 01:07:34.497
originated from contact between alien
life forms and ancient civilizations.

01:07:34.545 --> 01:07:36.458
Please don't touch anything!

01:07:38.539 --> 01:07:40.411
Most of these are for tourists,

01:07:40.411 --> 01:07:43.695
but there are one or two
pieces that are irreplaceable.

01:07:45.841 --> 01:07:47.134
This...

01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:49.313
This is what they were after.

01:07:51.446 --> 01:07:53.923
This is a "Luo Pan," right?

01:07:53.923 --> 01:07:55.698
An ancient Chinese compass?

01:07:55.698 --> 01:07:59.114
They're ancient texts claiming that
the traditional Luo Pan compass

01:07:59.114 --> 01:08:03.322
was modeled after an alien navigation
device that was so powerful,

01:08:03.322 --> 01:08:05.065
it could cross dimensions.

01:08:05.065 --> 01:08:06.540
An immortal Luo Pan

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.760
that blew apart on
its first journey here.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.575
Journey from where?
Another galaxy?

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:13.530
Another dimension.

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:16.645
It is said that they've been
searching for pieces of this device,

01:08:16.645 --> 01:08:18.904
for hundreds of our lifetimes.

01:08:19.644 --> 01:08:21.136
To put it back together.

01:08:21.161 --> 01:08:23.808
But wasn't the whole ancient
Feng Shui a compass?

01:08:23.808 --> 01:08:26.421
Just a misunderstanding
of how magnets work?

01:08:26.421 --> 01:08:30.462
Our old compasses are pale replicas
of the extraterrestrial original.

01:08:30.462 --> 01:08:33.859
They're barely to measure
fluctuations in "Chi."

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:38.212
They use magnetic needles
at their center.

01:08:41.904 --> 01:08:43.728
But the immortal Luo Pan,

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:47.191
had a piece of an ancient
meteorite at its core.

01:08:47.435 --> 01:08:49.886
A stone not of this world.

01:08:50.264 --> 01:08:52.327
Like the one you're wearing?

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.633
Come.

01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:10.069
Please, please don't touch anything.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.594
This represents years and years of work.

01:09:12.594 --> 01:09:15.915
I've devoted my whole
life to this research.

01:09:34.174 --> 01:09:35.697
I've seen this.

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:37.322
This?

01:09:38.247 --> 01:09:40.136
You've seen this shape?

01:09:41.013 --> 01:09:42.934
Yes, I've seen that.

01:09:42.934 --> 01:09:45.089
They had my daughter,

01:09:45.796 --> 01:09:48.526
and these other people in cages.

01:09:48.526 --> 01:09:51.680
And they were all spaced out
at exact distances

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.801
leading towards this.

01:09:54.308 --> 01:09:58.750
And they had green jade discs
strapped to their necks.

01:10:00.099 --> 01:10:01.165
Here.

01:10:04.353 --> 01:10:05.813
I built this machine

01:10:05.813 --> 01:10:07.746
to measure and locate disruptions

01:10:07.746 --> 01:10:09.499
to the natural flow of Chi,

01:10:09.499 --> 01:10:11.845
using ancient Feng Shui principles.

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:16.005
You see, my family have been tracking
the visitors for generations.

01:10:16.005 --> 01:10:20.036
They're almost impossible
to find because, as we've learnt,

01:10:20.061 --> 01:10:22.620
they can manipulate dimensional flux.

01:10:22.636 --> 01:10:24.369
Bend space time.

01:10:25.301 --> 01:10:27.101
But in doing so,

01:10:27.101 --> 01:10:29.653
they disrupt our
three-dimensional world.

01:10:29.653 --> 01:10:32.070
They disrupt the natural flow of Chi.

01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:34.262
Oh, they can do more than disrupt it.

01:10:34.262 --> 01:10:35.862
The things I've seen...

01:10:35.862 --> 01:10:37.159
What?

01:10:40.022 --> 01:10:43.251
You're saying you've actually
made contact with them?

01:10:43.251 --> 01:10:45.884
Oh, I've had contact
with them, alright, yeah.

01:10:46.426 --> 01:10:48.318
Ain't that something?

01:10:53.632 --> 01:10:55.062
Now this...

01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:57.245
This is what they're looking for.

01:10:57.274 --> 01:10:59.169
I want you to take it.

01:10:59.609 --> 01:11:00.940
Hold it.

01:11:03.441 --> 01:11:07.083
Let your aura infuse
the meteorite fragment.

01:11:07.108 --> 01:11:09.746
And then, place it there.

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.155
The Guide Stone Filament.

01:11:37.699 --> 01:11:40.130
Our long search...

01:11:40.834 --> 01:11:42.716
is over.

01:11:54.603 --> 01:11:56.650
You led them to me!

01:12:01.545 --> 01:12:04.297
<i>Thanks for the drink, Mister Hero.</i>

01:12:04.297 --> 01:12:07.755
<i>Not a hero yet.
Just finished basic training.</i>

01:12:08.438 --> 01:12:11.172
<i>- You're my everything
- You're my hero.</i>

01:12:11.172 --> 01:12:14.580
<i>I married a hero!
Not a gangster.</i>

01:12:56.018 --> 01:12:57.148
Hey!

01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:58.866
Hey!

01:12:58.891 --> 01:13:00.887
You need to focus.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.716
Focus!

01:13:02.716 --> 01:13:04.998
Come on! Wake up!

01:13:05.155 --> 01:13:06.826
I'll get his attention.

01:13:06.826 --> 01:13:08.357
You get away.

01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:10.579
No. Wait.

01:13:11.976 --> 01:13:13.674
There's no time.

01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:19.408
Hey!

01:13:19.483 --> 01:13:20.546
Hey!

01:13:20.773 --> 01:13:22.406
Hey!

01:13:24.106 --> 01:13:26.238
What the hell is going on here?

01:13:26.263 --> 01:13:27.889
Where am I?

01:13:27.914 --> 01:13:30.266
What am I doing here?

01:13:30.397 --> 01:13:33.637
I demand to know what's going on here!

01:14:55.578 --> 01:14:56.632
Hey!

01:14:57.156 --> 01:14:58.640
Hey, hey!

01:14:58.665 --> 01:15:00.051
You're all right, man?

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:03.642
Run!

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:04.912
What?

01:15:05.178 --> 01:15:06.335
Run!

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:20.585
Fight it!

01:16:21.714 --> 01:16:23.160
Come on, man!

01:16:23.261 --> 01:16:24.855
I know you're in there!

01:17:14.094 --> 01:17:15.808
Oh, come on!

01:17:47.982 --> 01:17:50.650
<i>When you hear the word "Lucy..."</i>

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:53.100
<i>You are going to wake up.</i>

01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:57.132
Lucy.

01:17:57.213 --> 01:17:58.557
Lucy.

01:17:59.171 --> 01:18:00.732
Lucy.

01:18:27.888 --> 01:18:29.790
You know that wasn't me, right?

01:18:32.168 --> 01:18:34.324
I'm glad to have you back.

01:18:38.867 --> 01:18:41.096
Sorry about that, man.

01:18:41.827 --> 01:18:43.150
Are you good?

01:18:44.315 --> 01:18:46.011
Let's go get 'em!

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.060
I won the fight, though, right?

01:18:55.573 --> 01:18:56.775
No man.

01:18:56.855 --> 01:18:58.224
I did.

01:19:11.207 --> 01:19:12.873
I think it's this way.

01:19:34.557 --> 01:19:36.004
Wait.

01:19:37.423 --> 01:19:39.701
I don't recognize this place.

01:19:39.757 --> 01:19:43.103
Something is very wrong
with the vibe here.

01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:44.863
It's not here. Come on.

01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:46.392
Let's go.

01:19:47.843 --> 01:19:50.709
Andrew!

01:19:52.198 --> 01:19:53.309
Hello?

01:19:53.326 --> 01:19:55.198
Andrew!

01:19:56.322 --> 01:19:57.764
And...

01:20:07.812 --> 01:20:09.233
Anna?

01:20:12.205 --> 01:20:13.856
Oh, my God!

01:20:14.178 --> 01:20:16.593
What the hell did they do to you?

01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:32.605
We need your form to
function in your world.

01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:35.424
Our old vessels were wearing thin.

01:20:35.424 --> 01:20:37.871
We had used them for too long.

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:42.341
So we got a new one.

01:20:42.759 --> 01:20:46.206
You're seeing this too, right?
There's three of them.

01:20:46.231 --> 01:20:47.294
Yeah.

01:20:47.596 --> 01:20:49.619
What have you done with my daughter?

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:50.956
And my wife?

01:20:51.542 --> 01:20:52.997
We need them.

01:20:53.339 --> 01:20:54.698
For what?

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:56.815
We need them to get home.

01:20:56.854 --> 01:20:58.859
We have been here for too long.

01:20:58.884 --> 01:21:02.192
The cycle between our form
gets shorter and shorter.

01:21:02.217 --> 01:21:04.606
Soon we will not survive.

01:21:04.606 --> 01:21:06.242
Keep them talking.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.552
Cowards!

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:15.286
Why don't you show us your true form?

01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:18.551
Our true form?

01:21:18.628 --> 01:21:21.248
Your mind would not comprehend.

01:21:21.363 --> 01:21:23.638
We exist in eight dimensions,

01:21:23.638 --> 01:21:26.127
while you perceive only four.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:28.250
Let's go.

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:32.782
It would be like an ant,

01:21:32.807 --> 01:21:36.496
trying to understand quantum mechanics.

01:21:38.459 --> 01:21:40.526
But since you insist,

01:22:01.368 --> 01:22:02.992
This isn't good.

01:22:06.072 --> 01:22:07.218
Run!

01:22:08.004 --> 01:22:09.464
Run!

01:22:19.141 --> 01:22:21.062
Oh, shit!

01:22:29.164 --> 01:22:31.137
You can't go.

01:22:31.165 --> 01:22:34.790
You have such strong and beautiful <i>Chi.</i>

01:22:34.959 --> 01:22:37.019
And for the next phase,

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:40.299
we need all that we can get.

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.528
Lucy?!

01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:34.953
Daddy! Daddy!

01:23:34.953 --> 01:23:37.399
Help me!
Get me out of here!

01:23:49.802 --> 01:23:50.959
Maya!

01:23:51.247 --> 01:23:52.542
Maya!

01:23:53.837 --> 01:23:56.502
You're here!
You found me!

01:23:56.527 --> 01:23:58.127
Of course I did!

01:24:04.576 --> 01:24:06.376
It is time.

01:24:08.778 --> 01:24:10.007
What?

01:25:02.188 --> 01:25:05.538
Lucy, I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.487
What's happening?

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:37.049
We are opening the door.

01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:45.010
What are you doing to them?

01:25:45.611 --> 01:25:48.316
We chose them for their strong Chi.

01:25:48.355 --> 01:25:50.215
To bring us home.

01:25:50.814 --> 01:25:52.171
Lucy!

01:25:54.026 --> 01:25:55.536
Lucy!

01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:05.269
Will they travel with you?

01:26:06.096 --> 01:26:09.174
No, Connor Wu. No.

01:26:09.174 --> 01:26:13.413
Your kind cannot cross
the portal and survive.

01:26:24.772 --> 01:26:28.196
And you'd disrupt our doorway home.

01:26:28.252 --> 01:26:30.475
We cannot have that.

01:26:32.477 --> 01:26:33.820
Besides...

01:26:34.192 --> 01:26:38.424
there won't be anything
left of them to take along.

01:27:13.296 --> 01:27:14.826
No!

01:27:15.473 --> 01:27:17.233
You let her go!

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:19.059
Do it!

01:27:19.097 --> 01:27:20.792
Lucy!

01:27:23.875 --> 01:27:26.608
No!
Stop it!

01:27:38.025 --> 01:27:39.919
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:27:39.958 --> 01:27:41.543
I'm sorry!

01:27:42.653 --> 01:27:43.994
Hey!

01:27:45.406 --> 01:27:47.607
- Quinn!
- Huh?

01:27:47.963 --> 01:27:49.550
I got this.

01:27:50.753 --> 01:27:52.670
It's gonna be okay.

01:27:58.355 --> 01:27:59.792
Oh, baby...

01:27:59.909 --> 01:28:02.083
You wanted your hero back?

01:28:03.529 --> 01:28:05.391
Well, here I am.

01:28:52.378 --> 01:28:53.752
Lucy!

01:28:55.349 --> 01:28:56.643
Daddy!

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:00.586
Let me look at you.

01:29:01.731 --> 01:29:03.044
Are you okay?

01:29:03.154 --> 01:29:04.745
- Yes!
- Yeah?

01:29:04.746 --> 01:29:06.256
Did they hurt you?

01:29:07.314 --> 01:29:09.201
I don't remember.

01:29:09.226 --> 01:29:10.687
You don't remember?

01:29:10.687 --> 01:29:12.669
Forgive me, sweetheart.

01:29:12.694 --> 01:29:14.225
Oh, my God!

01:29:32.296 --> 01:29:33.847
Connor?

01:29:37.048 --> 01:29:38.942
Connor!

01:29:43.347 --> 01:29:45.480
<i>Connor!</i>

01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:05.273
<i>Maya!</i>

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:09.411
<i>Maya!</i>

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.507
Connor?

01:31:16.092 --> 01:31:17.455
Connor?

01:31:17.579 --> 01:31:19.500
Connor, is that you?

01:31:19.525 --> 01:31:23.254
<i>Maya! Can you hear me?</i>

01:31:23.254 --> 01:31:25.820
Connor, I can hear you.
Where are you?

01:31:26.841 --> 01:31:29.622
<i>Help!</i>

01:31:30.501 --> 01:31:34.267
<i>Help!</i>

01:31:34.442 --> 01:31:44.442
