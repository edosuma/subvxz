00:15.140 --> 00:18.268
<i>For Terry, every day</i>
<i>means a new murder case,</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:21.771
<i>and a new celebrity guest star</i>
<i>as his partner.</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:26.484
<i>Today's guest:</i>
<i>film and television star Kumail Najiani.</i>

00:26.985 --> 00:28.653
<i>But here's the catch.</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:30.822
<i>Kumail isn't being given a script.</i>

00:30.905 --> 00:33.825
<i>He has no idea what's about to happen.</i>

00:34.325 --> 00:38.872
<i>Together, he and Terry will have</i>
<i>to improvise their way through the case.</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:42.083
<i>But it'll be up to Kumail alone</i>
<i>to name the killer.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:46.087
<i>So join them</i>
<i>as they punch a one-way ticket</i>

00:46.921 --> 00:48.631
<i>to Murderville.</i>

00:54.137 --> 00:55.680
<i>Here in the big city,</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:57.682
<i>when the sun goes down,</i>

00:57.766 --> 01:00.602
<i>the freaks come out.</i>

01:02.228 --> 01:05.106
<i>And I was ready to get my freak on</i>

01:05.190 --> 01:09.235
<i>because tonight I was working</i>
<i>the night shift.</i>

01:17.619 --> 01:18.953
Terry?

01:19.662 --> 01:20.497
What are you still doing here?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.040
Well, I signed up for a double, Chief.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.416
Figure it's gonna be a slow one

01:23.500 --> 01:25.877
so I might go over the old evidence
from Lori's murder.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.171
Wait, isn't your high school
reunion tonight?

01:29.047 --> 01:31.049
Did you take this shift
so you wouldn't have to go?

01:31.132 --> 01:32.550
I can't show my face there.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.971
People expected big things for me, Rhonda.
What am I going to tell them?

01:37.055 --> 01:39.724
That I ended up a mediocre detective
with a dead partner

01:39.808 --> 01:43.853
and a failed marriage and the all-time
high score from Ms. Pacman.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.647
That's only one thing to be proud of.

01:45.730 --> 01:49.234
Well, if you're working,
then you're working with your new partner.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.277
No, Chief. Come on. Not again. Chief!

01:51.361 --> 01:52.445
- Okay. Come on.
- Hi.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.488
Hi.

01:53.571 --> 01:57.033
Kumail,
this is Senior Detective Terry Seattle.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.495
Terry, this is your new partner.
Kumail Nanjiani.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.539
Nice to meet you, Terry.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.125
Look at this. Handshake right off the bat.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.753
I bet this is some kind of hotshot sent
from the brass from downtown. Am I right?

02:08.837 --> 02:11.089
- Yeah. I did pretty well in school.
- Yeah.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.298
Listen, I'm off the clock.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.884
Do me a favor and don't screw up
anything while I'm gone.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.261
Why are you all dressed up anyway?

02:16.344 --> 02:17.929
You going to one
of those weird night funerals?

02:18.555 --> 02:19.597
Actually, I have a date.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.766
Is it okay that I told you that?

02:21.850 --> 02:23.393
Uh, no.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.936
We're getting a divorce, Terry.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.105
You want me to never go
on another date for the rest of my life?

02:27.188 --> 02:28.523
Yeah, there, you got it.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.109
I want you to end up
unhappy and alone just like me.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.652
- Oh, no, here we go.
- Here we go.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.946
That's right, I'm the bad guy
for not being as sad as you.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.614
I was sad, Terry.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.032
You barely touched me
for eight years,

02:38.116 --> 02:40.201
and I'm supposed to sit at home
with my hands folded?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.245
Absolutely not. I work hard.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.205
I need to be touched.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.207
Not to put you on the spot,
but which one of us is right?

02:46.291 --> 02:48.168
You said you hadn't had sex
for eight years?

02:48.251 --> 02:50.128
Exactly, hasn't even touched me.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.046
What's your definition of sex?

02:52.714 --> 02:53.631
Sex.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.426
You'll have to make these kind of snap
decisions out there in the field. Come on.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.844
- She's right.
- Thank you.

02:57.927 --> 02:58.761
What?

02:58.845 --> 03:01.639
Just based on the cadence of the argument.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.392
Stop using words
that I am not familiar with.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.312
Whatever. My Uber is going to be here
in 17 minutes.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.771
I better wait outside.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.648
I hope you have a terrible date.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.277
Which word did you not know?

03:15.069 --> 03:16.029
Codence.

03:17.488 --> 03:18.489
What did you say?

03:18.573 --> 03:19.574
I said cadence.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.200
- Why don't you pop a seat here?
- Yeah.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.203
Kumail, what makes you think
you got what it takes

03:24.287 --> 03:26.414
to hack it as a homicide detective?

03:26.497 --> 03:29.375
First of all, I'm very excited about this
opportunity. Thank you for having me.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.630
I just am very observant.
I'm very good at reading people.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.049
How many fingers
am I holding beneath the desk right now?

03:36.716 --> 03:37.717
I don't think it takes a good detect--

03:37.800 --> 03:38.927
You said you're observant.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.888
Yeah, but I can't literally--
I literally cannot observe that.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.599
I've got one hand.
So you know it's at most 5.

03:44.682 --> 03:45.850
Is your middle finger out?

03:45.934 --> 03:48.311
Not with intent or malice.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.479
But it is out.

03:50.939 --> 03:51.940
I don't know.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.026
How many fingers?

03:55.610 --> 03:56.653
I'm gonna go three.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.031
It was three.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.366
- I'm not surprised because--
- Yeah. It was three.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.283
You work out?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.284
I do.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.286
Yeah, I do too.
So let's not make this a thing.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.080
Yeah. No. You brought it up, sir.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.667
And I'm not just strong in the body.
I'm also as strong in the--

04:10.750 --> 04:12.961
I'm also brain strong,
and that's a technical term.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.087
Yeah.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.171
I brought up the mental toughness

04:15.255 --> 04:18.800
because it's important
to have that brain strength.

04:18.883 --> 04:19.801
Yes, sir.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.177
There's one thing you need to know.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.098
This partner is never going to go
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs on you,

04:25.848 --> 04:28.434
but I need to know
that I can count on you, Kumail.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.062
I need to know that when
the doo-doo goes sideways,

04:31.145 --> 04:32.772
when we are deep in the dog dirt,

04:32.855 --> 04:35.191
that your coconut's
not going to just crack open

04:35.275 --> 04:36.985
and leak all over my goddamn shoes.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.403
Do you think it will?

04:38.486 --> 04:39.779
I don't think it will.

04:39.862 --> 04:40.947
You don't think it will?

04:41.030 --> 04:41.948
No. It won't.

04:42.031 --> 04:45.827
We need to be sure, and that is why
I need you to take a psychopath test.

04:45.910 --> 04:46.911
Psychopath test?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.706
That's right.
Psychopath test, question one.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.666
Are you a psychopath?

04:51.749 --> 04:52.792
No.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.210
That's actually not part of the test.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.547
I just ask that because if you said yes
then I wouldn't bother.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.631
You'd save time?

04:58.715 --> 05:01.759
Have you ever experienced remorse,
shame, or guilt?

05:01.843 --> 05:03.011
Yes.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.220
Which one most?

05:04.804 --> 05:05.513
Shame.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.433
Shame, and why?
Be specific from your life.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.226
I mean, it's happened so many times.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.229
The thing that fills you
with the most daily shame

05:13.313 --> 05:15.189
that you can barely
look at yourself in the mirror.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.150
I don't feel
comfortable saying that to you.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.234
Middle shame.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.946
To low quality shame.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.823
Well, okay, I'll be honest.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.951
I've been in too many
car accidents in my life,

05:27.035 --> 05:28.703
and all of them have been my fault.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.706
All of them have been your fault.
Any legal issues, like lawsuits?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.082
No. No lawsuits, but, you know,

05:33.166 --> 05:35.877
like I just had to get new insurance
and they were like,

05:35.960 --> 05:37.420
"It says there was an accident."

05:37.503 --> 05:40.465
"What was it?" And I had to figure out
what the last one was.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.466
You'd forgotten?

05:41.549 --> 05:44.177
Yeah, 'cause I described it
to them and they were like that wasn't it.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.928
And I was like, oh,
that was two accidents ago.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.098
Are you able to form meaningful
relationships with others, Kumail?

05:49.182 --> 05:49.891
Yes.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.226
Do you believe that other people
are worthy of your love?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.603
Depends on the people.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.438
Do you think I'm worthy of your love?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.148
I just met you.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.400
Blank slate. Close your eyes.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.153
When you open your eyes, when I say 3,

06:02.236 --> 06:06.616
you're going to tell me
whether I seem like a lovable person.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.535
Not until I say 3. 1, 2, 3.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.205
Yeah, you seem very lovable.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.040
- I seem lovable, right?
- Yeah.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.084
You are doing great.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.087
Good thing.
My Uber canceled. There's been a murder.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.215
You're supposed to gasp.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.383
Weird gasp.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.595
Yeah, do that gasp again.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.058
- Yeah, very weird.
- Was that better? How would you do it?

06:33.309 --> 06:34.393
Like a asthmatic.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.187
Okay.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.357
- There's been a murder.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.484
More fear in the eyes. Been a murder!

06:42.735 --> 06:44.612
You're hearing the news about the murder,

06:44.695 --> 06:46.823
but you're also kind of happy about it.
There's been a murder.

06:49.075 --> 06:49.992
Great.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.452
- Seth Gourley--

06:51.536 --> 06:54.914
- No, no. We're finished with that.
- Okay. Sorry.

06:54.997 --> 07:00.002
Seth Gourley, tech billionaire and CEO
of the website Faceplace,

07:00.086 --> 07:03.673
was found dead at
City Public High School's 30-year reunion.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.424
Wait, that's my reunion.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.468
Now I got a reason to be there.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.636
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.556
You two better not mess this up
like Terry messed up all of high school.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.641
According to you.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.977
Well, you don't need to throw it--

07:16.060 --> 07:17.061
That's fair play.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.188
So did you go to school with this guy?

07:19.272 --> 07:22.233
Wow. I wonder if Lisa Capobianco
is gonna be there.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.694
We were high school lovers.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.530
Pretty hot and heavy for a couple people

07:28.281 --> 07:30.074
who never actually spoke.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.160
In what sense were you lovers?

07:32.869 --> 07:34.162
Ah, there she is.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.622
Do you have a high school lover?

07:36.706 --> 07:37.957
I dated someone in high school,

07:38.040 --> 07:40.877
but we did speak so that's a different
type of relationship.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.839
Sounds kind of nerdy
if you guys were talking to each other.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.424
We did more than just talk.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.926
Did you share some laughs
about some high school things?

07:49.010 --> 07:51.554
"Look at the grass.
When the wind--"

07:52.555 --> 07:54.265
- We did share--
- "Let me write a poem about you."

07:54.348 --> 07:57.894
"Oh, to talk to you
and to laugh about words."

07:57.977 --> 07:59.061
Am I right?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.062
No, I never did that.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.189
Missed opportunity.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.316
What's the name of that high school
crush of yours by the way?

08:04.233 --> 08:06.027
I don't want to reveal that right now.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.987
Say their name.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.822
I'm not going to.

08:09.906 --> 08:10.990
Can you rhyme the name?

08:11.073 --> 08:11.908
I'm not going to.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.409
- Okay, you're going to open up to me.
- I feel like we're on the cusp--

08:13.493 --> 08:15.495
- You're going to open up to me eventually.
- I don't want--

08:15.578 --> 08:17.121
All right. Let's go solve a murder.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.123
Really jumpy.

08:22.335 --> 08:26.172
<i>We headed over to the high school</i>
<i>to find the reunion in full swing.</i>

08:26.255 --> 08:28.841
<i>It was good to see all the vaguely</i>
<i>familiar faces</i>

08:28.925 --> 08:31.427
<i>of people I'd forgotten ever existed,</i>

08:31.511 --> 08:33.179
<i>but there was no time for chitchat.</i>

08:33.262 --> 08:36.474
<i>We had a dead body</i>
<i>to stare at and walk around.</i>

08:40.228 --> 08:44.190
Ah… Look at this. It's study hall room.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.360
I spent a lot of time in here.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.239
- Studied a lot?
- Kidding, obviously.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.282
No, study hall was

08:53.366 --> 08:57.495
for losers who wanted to have secure jobs
and successful lives.

08:59.622 --> 09:03.251
Hey, Terr-bear. Ooh, nice shirt.
What is that? Polyester?

09:03.334 --> 09:05.294
- It's dacron, actually.
- Okay.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.047
The stuff they use to make couch cushions.

09:08.130 --> 09:11.801
Amber Kang, forensics, this is Kumail.
Kumail, Amber Kang.

09:11.884 --> 09:12.760
My first day.

09:12.843 --> 09:13.928
What do we got here?

09:14.011 --> 09:14.845
Ah, yes.

09:14.929 --> 09:18.558
Seth Gourley, former dweeb
turned billionaire tech oligarch,

09:18.641 --> 09:22.228
creator of your mother's favorite
social networking site, Faceplace.

09:22.311 --> 09:25.439
Cause of death is a vintage
America Logged On CD-ROM,

09:25.523 --> 09:27.775
buried like a throwing star
in his carotid artery.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.860
Someone flung it at a high velocity.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.572
Right. Go ahead.
Tell me what do you see, Kumail?

09:33.281 --> 09:36.367
His hands and feet
are bound with rope.

09:36.450 --> 09:40.246
Excellent knots, too.
Not your average shoelace bunny ears.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.749
Does he seem like he and I
could be the same year

09:43.833 --> 09:45.501
because he seems a lot older.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.836
I would say the same age. I would say--

09:46.919 --> 09:49.839
Well, hang on a second,
I'm asking the homicide--

09:49.922 --> 09:51.966
- You would say?
- Obviously so.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.218
Could you make that face so we could tell?

09:55.177 --> 09:56.095
Easily.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.474
He looks younger.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.018
- He looks younger.
- He looks younger.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.728
That's a bunch of BS.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.397
I honestly, when you closed your eyes
and did that,

10:06.480 --> 10:08.190
I couldn't tell which one was dead.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.235
Let me ask you something, Kumail.

10:11.319 --> 10:14.155
If you're such a smarty pants,
did you check his mouth?

10:15.156 --> 10:16.490
Check his mouth?

10:16.574 --> 10:17.491
You didn't check the mouth?

10:17.575 --> 10:19.076
Is there anything in there?

10:21.162 --> 10:22.330
Oh. There is.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.625
There seems to--

10:28.461 --> 10:30.254
- This--
- What is it?

10:35.009 --> 10:37.178
Looks like the murderer did not like him.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.264
You just learned a very valuable lesson.

10:40.348 --> 10:45.978
The number one thing you always do
is check the mouth for murder notes.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.024
<i>Our first suspect</i>
<i>was Kevin Rivera,</i>

10:50.107 --> 10:52.693
<i>Seth's childhood friend</i>
<i>and former business partner.</i>

10:52.777 --> 10:54.737
<i>They'd had a falling out</i>
<i>right around the time</i>

10:54.820 --> 10:57.531
<i>Seth got spaceship rich off Faceplace.</i>

10:57.615 --> 11:00.201
Hard to believe this guy
got taken advantage of.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.371
"You may be deceived
if you trust too much,

11:03.454 --> 11:06.540
but you will live in torment
if you don't trust enough."

11:06.624 --> 11:11.087
Eagle Scout…
Virgins by Choice Club Treasurer,

11:11.170 --> 11:13.589
voted second most likely to succeed.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.425
I wonder who was voted
most likely to succeed.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.469
The person who came in first.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.054
That's a fair assumption.

11:20.137 --> 11:23.349
The Virgins by Choice.
Who would choose to be a virgin?

11:23.432 --> 11:26.310
I mean, think about it, when you're
that age, you want to go on dates.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.063
You went on a bunch
with your girlfriend…

11:29.939 --> 11:32.525
And her name is,
forgive me, is escaping me.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.694
No, I'm never going to tell you her name.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.280
Let's go find Kevin Rivera.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.537


11:45.454 --> 11:48.582
Kevin, Terry Seattle Class of '91,

11:48.666 --> 11:52.169
technically graduated in '92,
but now I'm a Senior Detective.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.922
Kevin Rivera.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.800
- Kevin. Kevin.
- Kevin.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.717
Shout.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.052
- Kevin.
- Kevin.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.263
- Kevin Rivera.
- Shout as loud as you can.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.180
Kevin!

12:03.264 --> 12:04.265
Jump up and down.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.975
Jumping up and down makes--

12:06.058 --> 12:07.893
- Makes yourself big. Make yourself big.
- What would that do?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.812
Kevin!

12:09.895 --> 12:11.689
- Kevin! Go tap him on the--
- Kevin?

12:11.772 --> 12:13.232
Tap him on the shoulder or something.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.907
Okay, I'm sorry.
I get really absorbed when I'm coding…

12:21.991 --> 12:24.368
Sorry, we said your name
really loud many times.

12:24.452 --> 12:28.747
I just needed a getaway.
Hide out for a little bit.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.249
You code to relax?

12:30.332 --> 12:32.835
- Hey, wait a minute, I know you.
- Yeah.

12:32.918 --> 12:37.339
Yeah, you were the kid who's always
fainting and passing out for no reason.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.925
Well, I mean, yes.
No, I would every once in a while,

12:40.009 --> 12:43.345
occasionally I fainted
from just a very light social anxiety.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.055
It was not a big deal.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.141
No, I remember it being a really big deal.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.351
Kumail, you want to--
Let's just get into…

12:49.435 --> 12:52.104
You got anything
you want to ask Kevin Rivera?

12:53.355 --> 12:56.817
Yeah, is it okay if we ask you a couple
questions about the death of your partner?

12:56.901 --> 12:59.487
Could you describe
your relationship with the victim?

12:59.570 --> 13:03.115
Yeah. Well, Seth and I
were best friends from

13:03.199 --> 13:05.910
pre-school all the way through college.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.995
We would spend
a lot of time in here, you know,

13:08.078 --> 13:10.331
just coming up
with like really cool stuff.

13:10.414 --> 13:14.293
We came up with this website
that would rank all the girls in school.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.628
Rank them in terms of what?

13:15.711 --> 13:17.838
You know, if they're nice or pretty
or their hair…

13:17.922 --> 13:18.839
Okay, you can't do that.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.383
And like,
we also would do one ranking their boobs.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.551
- It's getting worse.
- Okay.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.053
Each category makes it worse.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.680
We would rank
the individual boob, so it was,

13:26.764 --> 13:28.599
you know, one was nicer
than the other kind of a thing.

13:28.682 --> 13:29.683
Yeah, less of a set.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.478
I think that's okay.
I think you can do that now.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.938
I don't think you could ever do that.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.773
So, how did it go?
How did it end with you and--

13:35.856 --> 13:36.690
Well,

13:36.774 --> 13:39.610
it was fine until Seth took my big idea

13:39.693 --> 13:42.446
and he used it to start Faceplace.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.906
Why didn't you sue him?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.741
Well, to be honest the--

13:45.824 --> 13:48.452
The big idea was start a company.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.830
Oh. That was the entirety of the idea?

13:51.914 --> 13:55.376
He's a billionaire
and I have severe carpal tunnel syndrome.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.295
So how did that make you feel
when he stole your big idea,

13:58.379 --> 14:00.548
i.e. start a business.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.550
Vulnerable and used.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.636
And did those feelings of hurt
turn into anger?

14:05.719 --> 14:07.179
Yeah. Violent rage.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.806
Violent rage.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.349
- What do you do now?
- Tons of worry.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.893
Well, I'm an app developer.
I develop apps.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.144
What kind of apps are we talking?

14:14.228 --> 14:17.356
Seth thought of me as just like a code
monkey, but I have really good ideas.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.608
I mean, you mean better
than rank boobs individually?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.694
You want to hear? It's a meditation app.

14:21.777 --> 14:22.987
Oh, that's great.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.739
That's great because there aren't
enough meditation apps on the market.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.449
This one's different.
This one's called ShushHead.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.202
It helps you get rid
of all the intrusive thoughts

14:30.286 --> 14:32.288
that you have in your head
when you're trying to meditate.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.664
That's the hardest part
of meditation, you know?

14:33.747 --> 14:36.458
Right. I'm just like, I'm meditating,

14:36.542 --> 14:37.376
and does my mom love me?

14:37.459 --> 14:39.336
Now, the thoughts are--

14:39.420 --> 14:41.505
- And then it's like that self-doubt.
- Like that little voice.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.633
I'm that voice that's like you're
in Kumail, you're not good enough.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.885
No, that was terrible.

14:45.968 --> 14:46.552
That's not what--

14:46.635 --> 14:48.721
Kumail, what are you doing?
You're so stupid.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.265
- That's not what happens.
- Nobody's ever been this stupid before.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.226
That's not my inner voice.
Make it sound more Pakistani,

14:54.852 --> 14:57.855
but don't be racist,
but do an impression of a Pakistani guy.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.607
- Okay.
- But don't be racist.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.859
- Good luck.
- Okay.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.277
Okay. Here we go. You ready?

15:03.861 --> 15:04.695
Yeah.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.822
Hello,

15:07.615 --> 15:11.493
I'm originally from Pakistan,
but moved to London when I was three.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.620
Bravo. Bravo.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.496
I didn't like that he moved to London.

15:14.580 --> 15:18.042
It's still in beta,
but I'm willing to show you.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.710
We'd love to take a look at your new--

15:19.793 --> 15:22.463
Why don't you have a seat here?

15:22.546 --> 15:26.467
Remember, it's in beta,
but it really does work.

15:26.550 --> 15:31.221
Okay, just relax and follow
the guided meditation.

15:37.102 --> 15:42.399
<i>Shut up brain. Shut the hell up. Stop it.</i>

15:42.483 --> 15:44.818
<i>Stop that thought. Stop.</i>

15:44.902 --> 15:46.820
<i>Just freaking meditate.</i>

15:46.904 --> 15:49.073
<i>Harder! Relax harder!</i>

15:49.156 --> 15:52.993
<i>Why can't you do one simple thing?</i>

15:53.077 --> 15:56.288
<i>You're useless!</i>
<i>No wonder everyone secretly hates you.</i>

15:56.372 --> 15:58.415
<i>You deserve to be unhappy.</i>

15:58.499 --> 15:59.583
Right…

16:00.084 --> 16:02.169
What do you think? Honest opinion.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.046
Yeah, it doesn't matter what I think.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.924
- Be as honest as you possibly can.
- I'm not a mediation expert.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.426
- Why would you-- You don't need to--
- Well, you seem like you're very relaxed.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.180
- I think it's awful. It sucks.
- Jesus, Kumail.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.598
- Why don't you just get out?
- Let's just get out.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.184
- Just get out of here. Get out of here!
- We're gonna get out of here.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.560
- Get out of here!
- We're gonna go. Look, we're leaving.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.728
Let's go. Come on.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.480
Get out of here!

16:22.731 --> 16:24.775
Do you see what he's doing?
That's the murder weapon.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.361
Okay.
Don't take one of those to the head.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.615
<i>Next on our most likely</i>
<i>to commit murder list</i>

16:31.699 --> 16:33.367
<i>was none other than Brad Torker,</i>

16:33.450 --> 16:34.451
<i>king of the jocks.</i>

16:35.035 --> 16:38.539
<i>Apparently, he was seen talking with Seth</i>
<i>not long before he was found dead.</i>

16:38.622 --> 16:41.208
This guy was a real
piece of work in high school.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.294
Varsity football QB,
president intramural Fight Club.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.756
"No fatties except summers and weekends."

16:47.840 --> 16:49.675
- Makes sense.
- Why does it make sense?

16:49.758 --> 16:51.969
Because the weekends
are kind of like short summers.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.430
You're gonna have to pose
as a former classmate

16:54.513 --> 16:56.348
otherwise he won't talk to you. Okay?

16:56.432 --> 16:57.016
Oh…

16:57.099 --> 16:58.308
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.309
All right.

16:59.393 --> 17:04.440
So your undercover name
is Cornelius Weinerbottom. Got it?

17:04.523 --> 17:06.108
Um… Does it have to be that?

17:06.191 --> 17:07.443
What's your name?

17:08.110 --> 17:09.486
- Okay, can we--
- What's your name?

17:09.570 --> 17:11.947
- I'm Brad. What's your name?
- Is it negotiable?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.240
Say your name to me real quick.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.908
Cornelius Weinerbottom.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.785
All right. What about a cool walk?
Can you do a cool walk?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.079
Show me how you could do a cool walk.
Let's see.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.956
He's going to be watching. Do a cool walk.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.708
- Why don't you--
- One, two, three.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.918
Hey, Cornelius, show me how you walk cool.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.670
Yeah, he's cool. Walk it out.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.755
Stop.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.050
Freeze, don't move a muscle.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.513
While you're walking,
pretend that your wrists,

17:36.597 --> 17:39.600
you have rubber bands attached to
the ground so they're kind of pulling you.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.894
You know, like a rubber band as you walk.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.854
That's what cool, yeah. And go.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.399
Continue. Rubber band.
Rubber band. There we go.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.027
Rubber band.
My man's got a rubber band and stop.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.572
Back towards me.
There we go. The rubber bands.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.615
Rubber bands.

17:54.698 --> 17:57.826
I don't care. Forward. I don't care.
Do it. The whole thing.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.954
And your head is being pushed down
to one side,

18:01.038 --> 18:02.998
being held by like cement. One side.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.794
And bounce, rubber bands,
hands, knees. I don't care. Go.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.464
- Whatever.
- Come back.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.008
Everything backwards. Care? I don't.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.595
- Say it.
- Care--

18:18.388 --> 18:20.599
- You got to say it. What?
- Care don't I.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.352
- Okay, say it again care.
- Care don't I.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.148
- Being cool is a lot of effort.
- Well, we're screwed. We are screwed.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.862
Rubber band between the knees.
Rubber band.

18:34.655 --> 18:38.909
Yo, yo, yo, Brad, it's your boy, Terry.
Terry Seattle.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.119
Who?

18:40.202 --> 18:42.746
Senior Detective Terry Seattle,
class of '91.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.790
We had metal shop together.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.834
Oh, yeah,

18:46.917 --> 18:48.836
you're the kid that was always
fainting and then farting

18:48.919 --> 18:49.962
after you fainted
while he was unconscious.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.088
Oh. No, I don't--

18:51.171 --> 18:54.758
Yeah, we had a name for it. We called it
"farnting." You're Terry, Terry Farnter.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.052
I actually don't even remember that.
That seems improbable to me.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.139
Well, you wouldn't remember it
because you were fainted before it, right?

19:00.222 --> 19:02.474
Are you here
because of the murder thing or--

19:02.558 --> 19:05.227
What? No. We're just--

19:05.310 --> 19:08.230
Look how cool. Tell him your name
and show him your cool walk.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.315
Sup, it's Cornelius Weinerbottom.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.986
Weinerbottom. Wait until you see--
Show him how you walk.

19:14.069 --> 19:17.156
- No, I don't need to do it.
- He needs to see it.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.158
- Walk to that. Watch him walk to this.
- He saw me walk in.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.701
I haven't seen him walk once.

19:20.784 --> 19:24.788
You have to walk. You're gonna blow it.
You're about to blow our cover.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.540
Don't blow our cover.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.042
I'm just going to check out back here,
see what's going on.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.211
Wait till you see-- What?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.131
What's your name?

19:34.214 --> 19:35.549
Sup? Cornelius Weinerbottom.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.177
I mean, you're cool,
but I don't remember you.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.928
No, man. We went
to school together, remember?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.305
Yeah? What home room were you in?

19:41.388 --> 19:42.681
Four.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.349
That's what home room I was in.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.767
Yeah. You don't remember? We did the--

19:45.851 --> 19:48.353
We're going to sing
the school fight song together.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.022
- Okay?
- He was kidding around.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.899
- One, two, three.
- You don't really need to--

20:18.634 --> 20:19.927
Guess you did go here, huh?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.970
Yeah. Just like I remember it.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.972
And what a year it was, huh?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.683
A lot of amazing memories
in this locker room right here.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.185
Yeah, man, me too. Oh.

20:28.268 --> 20:31.230
Found some of my old graffiti right
over here on this locker. Look at that.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.399
Brad, what happened
between you and Seth tonight, dude?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.777
Oh, it's so embarrassing.
I don't even want to talk about it.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.195
Oh, you don't have to be embar--
We're cool.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.280
- No, dude. We're just hanging out.
- It's me and my boy.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.074
- What's your name?
- It's me, Cornelius.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.700
Alls I did was tell him that I thought

20:43.784 --> 20:45.327
what he did to me in high school
wasn't right.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.620
It was the…

20:46.703 --> 20:49.456
Hey, listen. I was a star athlete, right?

20:49.539 --> 20:51.416
- Of course. Right.
- Okay? Every sport.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.586
Football, basketball, water polo,
Marco Polo,

20:54.670 --> 20:58.882
ultimate frisbee, penultimate frisbee,
fencing, bullying, screaming, baseball,

20:58.966 --> 21:01.218
but football? Oh…

21:01.301 --> 21:02.552
Football was my thing.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.971
I remember, he was--

21:04.054 --> 21:07.307
It was my destiny
to play professional football in Canada,

21:07.391 --> 21:11.687
but you gotta take the SATs,
and I'm not big into remembering things.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.231
So I paid Seth to take 'em for me.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.775
Day of the test,
that dill weed didn't even show up.

21:16.858 --> 21:19.194
Oh, what a dill weed move.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.737
If that happened to me I would kill him.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.406
Yeah. So what happened after?

21:22.489 --> 21:25.492
What do you think happened?
I had to take it myself.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.703
I got a minus forty for "hate speech".

21:27.786 --> 21:28.787
Minus forty.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.205
Many, many wrong answers.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.375
My dreams of playing professional football
in Canada were over before they began.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.753
I spend most of my weekends
getting drunk on my houseboat.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.213
Do you have a boat? You boat? You ever?

21:38.297 --> 21:39.464
I got three boats.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.174
Do you? What kind?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.051
Schooner, fishing…

21:43.135 --> 21:44.177
- No, yeah.
- Fishing, yeah.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.929
Uh… Sea-doo.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.723
- A sea-doo. Well, it's not really--
- Well, that's not really a boat.

21:47.806 --> 21:48.890
That's a personal watercraft.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.686
Actual Sea-Doo brand?
Or is it a different?

21:52.769 --> 21:54.187
It's a generic Sea-Doo knock off.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.024
But you have a houseboat.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.900
Well, that's what I call it so.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.110
Is it a houseboat?

22:00.193 --> 22:02.654
Well, I mean I live on it.
So yeah, it's like a house.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.323
Is it a houseboat?

22:04.406 --> 22:06.116
I live on a rowboat.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.952
It's cool.
We're going to cool walk out.

22:09.036 --> 22:09.870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.163
Good to catch up.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.832
- Dude, really miss you.
- Cool walking.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.500
- Later.
- There he is.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.796
That is a cool walk.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.758
<i>The investigation</i>
<i>was going well,</i>

22:22.841 --> 22:26.762
<i>but it was about to take</i>
<i>a very unexpected and very romantic turn.</i>

22:27.554 --> 22:29.389
Lisa Capobianco.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.600
Oh, that's the girl you never talked to.

22:31.683 --> 22:35.062
We had the thing. The unspoken bond with.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.438
Seems like it was very unspoken.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.191
Wow, I mean, that's-- Where is she?

22:40.609 --> 22:44.362
Oh, Lisa Capobianco. Varsity cheer squad.

22:44.446 --> 22:48.366
All state disc golf. Voted best face.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.952
You should see some of the stuff
she wrote in my yearbook there.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.913
You said that she never--

22:52.996 --> 22:55.207
She wrote a bunch of stuff
in the yearbook that was pretty--

22:56.041 --> 22:58.627
Good luck. That's it?
Did she run out of ink?

22:58.710 --> 23:01.213
Well, wishing me luck. She wanted me
to have luck and not just--

23:01.296 --> 23:03.173
It's seems like a generic thing.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.341
She's not the only one.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.425
You feeling okay, buddy?

23:05.509 --> 23:06.676
You know what we're gonna do?

23:06.760 --> 23:07.594
What are we gonna do?

23:07.677 --> 23:08.678
We're gonna do--

23:08.762 --> 23:10.680
We're gonna treat her like a suspect.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.891
Just till we can find out
whether she's single or not.

23:12.974 --> 23:16.853
I want you to take the lead so that I can
be kind of cool, like a good cop, bad cop.

23:16.937 --> 23:20.857
It's really important.
I need you to be rude and unattractive.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.735
So I need you to do like an ugly walk.
Okay?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.570
I need you to walk as ugly as possible.

23:26.321 --> 23:29.449
Like the ugliest, dirt walk,
like just like a…

23:29.533 --> 23:30.909
like you never walked before.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.327
How would that help you?

23:32.410 --> 23:34.246
Because it's going to make me look good.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.330
Okay.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.708
Okay, and then--
Who's good cop, bad cop?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.628
And then I'm good cop. You're stupid cop.

23:41.711 --> 23:42.921
Let me see your stupid face.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.091
Stupider.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.179
Freeze the face and walk.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.973
Keep the face. Ugly walk.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.725
There you go, and I'm going to go cool.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.145
Perfect.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.232
And you have a signature sound.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.111
What's your signature sound?

24:22.836 --> 24:23.962
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.088
Hi.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.549
Sorry to bother you, Mrs.…

24:27.632 --> 24:28.800
No, Ms.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.636
Ms. Capobianco. Yes!

24:31.720 --> 24:33.555
Senior Detective Terry Seattle,

24:33.638 --> 24:38.727
and this is very junior with a super
ugly walk and a weird signature sound.

24:38.810 --> 24:42.689
I don't know. Putting it all on
the line is like, just being free,

24:42.772 --> 24:44.774
there's something really hot about that.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.194
You like the walk? Yeah.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.988
We're here to ask about the murder.

24:50.071 --> 24:54.951
Oh, yeah. Sure.
I mean, I'll talk to a detective.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.954
Sure. I mean…
Did you guys figure out who did it yet?

24:58.038 --> 24:59.998
We just have a couple of dumb questions.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.041
Wait a second.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.083
Oh, here we go.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.710
I know you. You're…

25:03.793 --> 25:05.837
Yes, Terry. Terry.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.590
Oh, my God. You're Terry Farnter.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.050
No, no, no, no, no.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.468
Does everybody know about that?

25:11.551 --> 25:13.678
Oh, my God, he used to faint
and fart at the same time.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.014
It was hilarious and also really sad.

25:16.097 --> 25:17.807
Listen, nobody really remembers that.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.226
No, everybody remembers that.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.311
Everybody we've talked to
has so far remembered that.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.313
We had a vibe. You and I had a vibe.

25:23.396 --> 25:24.397
- Don't you remember?
- Did we?

25:24.481 --> 25:26.691
There was a whole
like will they, won't they thing…

25:26.775 --> 25:28.526
Seems like more like won't they,
won't they.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.695
The only thing I remember about you

25:30.779 --> 25:34.908
is like the principal wrestling
that helmet on your head,

25:34.991 --> 25:37.661
and you like for fighting him off
and saying,

25:37.744 --> 25:40.622
"Don't make me wear it.
Please, Mr. Madison."

25:40.705 --> 25:42.791
"I promise I won't fart no more."

25:42.874 --> 25:44.292
And then he was saying,
"You have to wear it

25:44.376 --> 25:46.670
because you know
you can't control it, Terry.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.880
"You have to wear it for insurance."

25:48.964 --> 25:52.259
And then you farnted so hard
you crapped your pants.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.010
- Oh, my God, you sharnted.
- Yeah.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.179
That was at the senior prom I think.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.266
Hard to forget something like that.
I don't know how you forgot.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.393
So you guys had questions for me?

26:01.476 --> 26:02.936
Yeah. Can we ask you a couple questions?

26:03.019 --> 26:05.563
You can ask me anything.
Anything you want.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.232
Can you describe
your relationship with the victim, Seth?

26:07.315 --> 26:08.233
With Seth.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.734
Well, we dated for years.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.611
What? No, she didn't know-- What?

26:11.695 --> 26:14.656
Yeah, we used to hook up right over there.
Stairwell seven.

26:14.739 --> 26:15.657
Wait, you guys dated?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.909
- Yeah. We were high school sweethearts.
- What?

26:17.993 --> 26:19.536
I mean, I know you didn't have
a high school sweetheart.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.870
Did you have a high school sweetheart?

26:20.954 --> 26:22.747
Yeah, I did.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.957
What was her name?

26:24.040 --> 26:25.625
I don't feel comfortable.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.252
Let me guess. I'm really good at this.

26:27.335 --> 26:28.211
Guess.

26:28.962 --> 26:29.838
Marmol.

26:30.964 --> 26:35.677
That's shockingly close.
You dated Seth in high school.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.887
And then we were together
like all through college.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.514
- Really? You didn't know?
- Yeah, but then he dumped me.

26:39.597 --> 26:40.765
Wait, he dumped you?

26:40.849 --> 26:43.184
He dumped me when Faceplace blew up.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.311
How did that make you feel?

26:44.394 --> 26:47.647
Like crap. Like a piece of garbage.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.233
He created Faceplace, became
very successful, what do you do now?

26:50.317 --> 26:51.526
Yeah. I was a journalist,

26:51.609 --> 26:55.280
but then that whole industry tanked
because of Faceplace.

26:55.363 --> 26:58.074
So yeah, basically Seth ruined my life.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.367
Can you just give us one second?

26:59.451 --> 27:02.078
Listen, you're asking
all these hard-nosed questions,

27:02.162 --> 27:03.413
you're being a total dick about this.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.373
Well, what do you want me to do?
I thought I was trying to solve a murder.

27:05.457 --> 27:08.043
Just find out if she's single. Find out
more about what she does now, okay?

27:08.126 --> 27:09.461
Okay. Hey, there.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.962
- We're back.
- Hi. You're back.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.465
So yeah, what do you do now
that you're not a journalist?

27:13.548 --> 27:17.552
I get paid 50 bucks a day to write
negative comments on YouTube videos,

27:17.635 --> 27:19.220
- but it's flexible hours.
- Okay.

27:19.304 --> 27:23.016
I get to drink while I work which
was a big problem at my last job.

27:23.099 --> 27:23.975
Which was?

27:24.059 --> 27:27.395
I was a bus driver.
You're a detective now?

27:27.479 --> 27:31.066
- Yeah.
- Here working on this murder?

27:31.149 --> 27:33.193
- Yeah.
- Wow.

27:33.276 --> 27:35.904
- That's something, right?
- So--

27:35.987 --> 27:37.489
Shut up.

27:37.572 --> 27:38.823
- You know what?
- What?

27:38.907 --> 27:40.784
- I'm feeling crazy.
- Are you?

27:41.493 --> 27:45.747
Do you want to meet me over
in stairwell seven and like, TB?

27:45.830 --> 27:47.165
What's TB?

27:47.749 --> 27:49.751
Touch boob.

27:50.418 --> 27:54.047
And remember as a champion disc golfer,

27:54.130 --> 27:56.883
I have really strong wrists.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.469
- Oh, yeah. One second. One second.
- Yeah.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.179
Listen, I'm really torn.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.599
What do we do? What are the ethics
of like getting, you know--

28:04.682 --> 28:05.725
Hooking up with a murder suspect?

28:05.809 --> 28:07.811
I don't know what the rules are right now.

28:07.894 --> 28:10.730
I'm still married to the chief, and so
she's on a date with somebody else

28:10.814 --> 28:13.566
and so all the rules are out the window,
and I feel like I want to go for it.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.943
Why not?

28:15.026 --> 28:17.570
- This is unethical.
- We're talking about Lisa Capobianco.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.823
And when it's Lisa Capobianco
you just go for it, okay?

28:19.906 --> 28:21.699
So that's what I'm gonna do. Lisa, I'm--

28:21.783 --> 28:23.118
Lisa!

28:23.701 --> 28:25.703
Lisa!

28:28.498 --> 28:30.125
I'll never forgive you for this.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.252
You did this to me.

28:39.217 --> 28:42.220
<i>My hot and cold love affair</i>
<i>with Lisa would have to wait.</i>

28:42.303 --> 28:46.433
<i>It was time for Kumail to decide</i>
<i>who he believed had murdered Seth Gourley.</i>

28:46.516 --> 28:47.350


28:47.434 --> 28:49.644
Hello. I speak to you tonight,

28:49.728 --> 28:52.522
not as your extremely successful
former classmate,

28:52.605 --> 28:56.192
but as a senior detective
in the city's homicide unit.

28:56.276 --> 29:00.655
Somebody was murdered and
one of these three suspects is the killer.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.117
Now Kumail, I want you to take this crown

29:04.200 --> 29:06.619
and put it on the head of the person

29:06.703 --> 29:09.956
you think killed Seth Gourley.

29:10.498 --> 29:12.792
Was it Kevin Rivera,

29:13.752 --> 29:15.503
Lisa Capobianco,

29:16.087 --> 29:17.464
or Brad Torker?

29:17.964 --> 29:22.886
It is time for you
to crown the king or queen…

29:24.512 --> 29:25.597
of murder.

29:27.265 --> 29:32.437
The killer of Seth Gourley is…

29:36.357 --> 29:37.358
Brad Torker!

29:37.442 --> 29:38.735
Oh, Torker.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.529
What's going on here?

29:41.613 --> 29:43.573
Chief, Kumail cracked the case.

29:43.656 --> 29:46.075
Wait, you're on a date with Daz?

29:46.159 --> 29:47.410
Not now, Terry.

29:47.494 --> 29:51.831
We were going to tell you,
just wanted to see if this is real first.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.126
Well, is it? I mean, you're wearing
matching bibs. It seems very real.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.252
It seems like they're getting along.

29:56.336 --> 30:01.007
Kumail, what makes you think
that Brad Torker killed Seth Gourley?

30:01.090 --> 30:02.425
Well, he had motive

30:02.926 --> 30:06.304
because he didn't help him
cheat on his SAT.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.892
He was a football player,
so he was good at throwing,

30:10.975 --> 30:13.311
which is what the murder weapon was.
It was thrown.

30:13.394 --> 30:16.731
We'd established early on
that the murderer was a good thrower,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.859
and he's got a boat. A rowboat.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.861
So he's good at tying knots,

30:21.945 --> 30:26.699
which is a skill he used to tie down
Seth Gourley before killing him.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.702
Well, I am shocked,

30:30.370 --> 30:32.872
though not surprised
to say that you are…

30:36.835 --> 30:37.794
100 percent correct.

30:37.877 --> 30:39.087
Yes!

30:40.046 --> 30:41.673
It was Brad Torker.

30:41.756 --> 30:43.174
I knew it.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.385
You obviously realized
that as a boat owner--

30:45.468 --> 30:47.136
I live on a rowboat.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.098
<i>Brad would have been an expert</i>
<i>in knot tying,</i>

30:50.181 --> 30:53.101
and he definitely
could have thrown the CD.

30:53.184 --> 30:56.938
By his own admission,
he was an elite Ultimate Frisbee player.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.773
Ultimate frisbee, penultimate frisbee.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.024
It couldn't have been Kevin.

31:00.108 --> 31:04.946
<i>His carpal tunnel left him unable</i>
<i>to throw the disc with any velocity,</i>

31:05.029 --> 31:08.157
and even though Lisa
was an accomplished disc golfer,

31:08.908 --> 31:11.995
she wrote in cursive,
but the murder note was in all caps,

31:12.662 --> 31:16.374
<i>matching Brad's high school</i>
<i>graffiti exactly.</i>

31:16.875 --> 31:21.129
I followed all that and had clocked it,
and I knew all that stuff.

31:21.212 --> 31:24.132
Kumail, congratulations.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.551
You know, you did a great job,
and I got to say,

31:28.177 --> 31:30.388
I'm really happy that I got to come back
here tonight

31:30.889 --> 31:34.893
because I got to see
that I'm not that same kid

31:35.935 --> 31:37.604
who went to high school here, and--

31:38.187 --> 31:39.272
Lisa,

31:39.981 --> 31:42.191
will you go on a date with me?

31:42.275 --> 31:43.610
Apparently, I can now.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.655
I literally don't know who you are.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.328
Did you just ask
another woman out in front of me?

31:53.912 --> 31:56.331
You literally went on
a date with Daz tonight.

31:56.414 --> 32:00.919
Yes. I'm on a date with Daz,
and I liked it, and I like him,

32:01.544 --> 32:02.587
and you know what we're going to do?

32:02.670 --> 32:05.006
We're going to go back to my house,

32:05.089 --> 32:08.968
which used to be your house
and I'm going to let him TB.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.512
- Touch boobs.
- Touch boob.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.224
Oh…

32:16.434 --> 32:19.479
Oh, no. It's happening again.

32:19.562 --> 32:20.396
Oh…

32:24.609 --> 32:26.611
Hey, Terry Farnter made it.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.447
<i>On the next episode</i>
<i>of</i> Murderville…

32:29.530 --> 32:32.533
Terry, meet your new partner,
Annie Murphy.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.118
I'm ready to solve a crime!

32:34.202 --> 32:35.036
Let's go!

32:35.870 --> 32:37.246
- You got your voice?

32:37.330 --> 32:38.957
<i>God, I can't believe</i>
<i>it's gonna end like this.</i>
