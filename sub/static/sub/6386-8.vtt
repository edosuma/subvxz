WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:04.837
We could actually
use a lead guitarist.

00:04.872 --> 00:07.073
- What do you call yourselves?
- Queens of Dogtown.

00:07.107 --> 00:09.876
Shit. Fuck.
The rabbit done died.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.644
- So whose is it?
- I don't know!

00:11.678 --> 00:13.446
- Charlie's?
- Fuck, no!

00:13.480 --> 00:15.281
That kid's
all snipped to shreds.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.083
I've had
a couple of vasectomies.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.886
What exactly are you
saying here, doc?

00:19.920 --> 00:22.021
There still could be swimmers
in his junk?

00:22.055 --> 00:24.457
How 'bout you rewrite
the script that I loathe?

00:24.491 --> 00:25.825
With Sasha's interest,

00:25.859 --> 00:28.427
we could be at Sundance
this time next year.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.428
I'm trying
to make the character

00:29.463 --> 00:30.596
a little more likeable,

00:30.631 --> 00:31.998
'cause on the page,
he's an asshole.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.300
You understand that you are
kind of talking about me.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.102
Wanna know how many
women I've slept with?

00:36.136 --> 00:37.436
Mm-mm. No.
No, no, no.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.572
I gotta get it up to 100.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.441
I'm makin' my move.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.776
I'm dropping out.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.412
Okay, so...No movie.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.180
- What's the good news?
- The good news

00:48.215 --> 00:49.982
is that I still wanna
have sex with you.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.418
At least once more.

00:52.452 --> 00:54.654
You know,
that is pretty good news.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.128
Ai-yow!

01:02.162 --> 01:05.965
Waah! Ha ha ha!

01:05.999 --> 01:08.834
Zah!

01:11.305 --> 01:13.773
All right.
You gotta stop that.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.309
I'm serious, I feel
a hate crime coming on.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.476
No, no, no.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.045
Don't be hatin'
on the good news dance.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.913
Does this mean
what I think it means?

01:20.948 --> 01:22.915
They finally came out
with spanx for men?

01:22.950 --> 01:25.151
No, silly.
That was months ago.

01:25.185 --> 01:27.219
I'm wearing one right now,
as a matter of fact.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.488
Yeah, yeah, firms my chest.
Flattens my tummy.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.458
Here, here, feel.
You can do it, come on.

01:32.492 --> 01:33.993
Ooh. Rock hard.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.361
I know, right?

01:35.395 --> 01:37.597
I'm talking about myself.
I'm rock hard right now.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.399
So am I!
Get a load of this.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.468
Sasha is back on board.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.470
Sha-fa-tha!
Why? What?

01:44.504 --> 01:45.471
Why?

01:45.505 --> 01:46.872
Eddie Nero's on board.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.474
Oh. Well, that makes sense.

01:48.508 --> 01:51.043
In a crass, sleazy,
opportunistic kind of a way.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.278
Sure.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.779
Sasha Bingham is also starring

01:53.814 --> 01:56.115
in <i>Slowly We Rot,</i> Deux.

01:56.149 --> 01:58.451
Yeah. That means
nothing to me.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.119
It's a zombie-cop-action-thriller.

02:00.153 --> 02:02.421
First one did 274 domestic.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.990
Right on.
Sounds like a shit sandwich,

02:04.024 --> 02:05.958
but, hey, the girl's
gotta eat, right?

02:05.993 --> 02:07.093
Good for her.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.661
No, no, good for you!

02:08.695 --> 02:10.863
Because Sasha Bingham
wants her one Hank Moody

02:10.896 --> 02:12.999
on set to polish her dialogue.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.934
What makes you think
that one Hank Moody

02:14.968 --> 02:16.469
has any interest
in doing such a thing?

02:16.503 --> 02:19.005
They got 100 grand to spend

02:19.039 --> 02:21.240
for one week's work.

02:21.274 --> 02:22.608
A hundy large?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.844
That is a most excellent
number of quatloos!

02:24.878 --> 02:26.112
Sold!

02:26.146 --> 02:27.947
Good! 'Cause I already
said you'd do it!

02:27.981 --> 02:29.081
Ha ha ha!

02:29.116 --> 02:30.683
- Turn that over.
- Oh, yeah.

02:30.717 --> 02:31.851
Gimme that.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.285
See, it's the good news dance.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.538
Let me guess.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.039
She's asking for you.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.507
Tell her to fuck off.
I'm smoking.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.242
You want me to tell her that?

03:30.277 --> 03:32.678
I'm comin'.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.147
The things we do
for quatloos, huh?

03:35.182 --> 03:37.183
You don't...
you don't get paid.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.651
First team is ready.

03:38.685 --> 03:39.652
Action!

03:44.591 --> 03:46.892
Die!
Die, motherfucker, die!

03:48.895 --> 03:50.029
And cut.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.231
All right, let's go again
right away.

03:52.265 --> 03:53.365
Reset.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.767
Really?
Don't you have it already?

03:54.801 --> 03:56.001
If I had it already,

03:56.036 --> 03:57.737
you'd be second-guessing me
from down here

03:57.771 --> 03:59.438
instead of up there, okay?

03:59.473 --> 04:02.541
Hank, can you pitch me
a bunch of alts for this scene?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.276
I don't think my character
would say this shit.

04:04.311 --> 04:08.714
Uh, first of all, who says
it's your fucking character?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.916
And secondly,
I don't give a fuck.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.318
Say the line.
Don't say the line.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.287
I'm going
Alan Smithee on this bitch.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.923
I can't work like this.
Get me down.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.426
Let's go again, okay?
Right away, right?

04:20.459 --> 04:23.262
And...Everybody.
And action!

04:25.432 --> 04:26.899
Suck my dick, asshole.

04:26.933 --> 04:27.933
Cut.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.369
Get her down.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.438
Got 15 minutes, okay?

04:32.472 --> 04:34.273
I don't want 15 minutes.
I wanna go home.

04:34.307 --> 04:37.343
You're telling me.
Fuckin' sequels.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.419
Quick.
We have 15 minutes.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.555
Well, not too quick.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.323
I thought you wanted
to work on the scene.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.892
Please. There is no fixing
that thing.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.561
I just wanted to play...
With you.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.029
Again?

04:57.063 --> 04:59.398
I'm ill a little sore
from this morning's playdate.

04:59.432 --> 05:01.100
Pussy.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.402
You know, I'm a writer, Sasha,

05:03.436 --> 05:05.204
not a fuck toy.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.372
Don't look now,

05:06.406 --> 05:08.274
but your manpon string
is hanging out.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.575
Ah! You see that?
You're funny.

05:09.609 --> 05:10.709
You can write your own stuff.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.278
Of course I can.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.047
But it's so lonely.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.450
No. No.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.452
You're not answering that.
Don't do it.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.254
You're answering it!

05:22.289 --> 05:24.089
I'm hating you right now.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.392
You know, I don't like you
when you're working.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.227
Just sayin'.
Hello?

05:28.261 --> 05:30.229
What?

05:30.263 --> 05:31.430
Fuck me.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.698
Okay. Just cut her off,

05:32.732 --> 05:34.900
and I'll be there
as soon as I can.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.569
Fuck.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.437
Where are you going?
You can't leave.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.472
My kid.
She's up to no good again.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.274
- I gotta go deal with her.
- No, no, no, no.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.976
You have to take care
of this kid.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.978
You're bought
and paid for, Moody.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.159
Now, there's that writer's
mind at work.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.293
Now we're talkin'.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.462
Mmm. Get your freak on,
officer.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.673
No. Where the fuck
are you going?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.042
This isn't funny, asshole.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.178
Fuck.

06:26.586 --> 06:30.256
♪ Well, I don't know why
I came here tonight ♪

06:30.290 --> 06:34.026
♪ I got the feelin'
that something ain't right ♪

06:34.060 --> 06:36.862
♪ I'm so scared
in case I fall off my chair ♪

06:36.897 --> 06:38.564
You know, Bex, you're really
making me regret

06:38.598 --> 06:42.167
ever signing you up
for guitar lessons.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.070
I only ever did it
because you wanted me to.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.339
Really? It seemed to me
you were pretty into it.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.376
Yeah. I'm just trying
to make you feel bad.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.279
Well played, young lady.
Well played.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.315
You're really partying
like a rock star these days,

06:56.349 --> 06:57.816
- aren't ya?
- Oh, yeah.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.819
I'm a fuckin' rock star,
all right.

07:00.854 --> 07:04.256
Can't even convince a boy
to let me give him a blow job.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.393
Becca...

07:07.427 --> 07:08.961
What?

07:08.995 --> 07:11.330
I'm not allowed to be honest?

07:11.364 --> 07:13.766
Isn't that the Moody
family thing?

07:13.800 --> 07:16.402
Our most prized virtue?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.337
The honesty.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.438
Go ahead, be honest.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.573
Give your father
a massive coronary event.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.842
I'm not a happy camper, dad.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.711
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.947
I don't like how
things are changing.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.416
You're never around.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.218
But I'm not sure
I even miss you.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.122
I'll always be your father.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.792
No duh, dad.

07:39.826 --> 07:43.162
But what the fuck
does that mean?

07:43.196 --> 07:45.998
And you know
what really scares me?

07:46.032 --> 07:47.700
What?

07:47.734 --> 07:50.402
I like being fucked up.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.404
Now more than ever.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.107
Is that a kid thing?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.609
Or a genetic thing?

07:57.644 --> 08:00.879
'Cause I'm starting
to get it now.

08:00.914 --> 08:04.283
Things are way funnier
when I'm high.

08:04.317 --> 08:08.887
And the sad stuff is just...
Way less sad.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.223
It's almost...

08:11.257 --> 08:13.292
Romantic.

08:13.326 --> 08:17.563
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

08:17.597 --> 08:20.032
What is the big fucking deal?

08:20.066 --> 08:21.934
I mean, it's not like
I haven't done this before,

08:21.968 --> 08:23.602
twi... once.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.637
In college.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.639
Right.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.508
So let's talk about
something else,

08:29.542 --> 08:32.177
something pleasant,
something with, uh...

08:32.212 --> 08:35.481
Rainbows and...unicorns.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.649
Stu asked me
to move in with him.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.851
He did?

08:38.885 --> 08:40.619
Well, I mean, that's exciting.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.821
- Have you met Stu?
- No.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.456
Because you won't let me.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.091
Yeah, because you'll judge me.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.226
That's ridiculous.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.294
I've been judging you
for years.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.466
Jesus!

08:54.501 --> 08:56.168
That's what you call
a late-term abortion.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.836
Is that shit even legal?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.105
Marcy,
I don't think everyone is here

09:00.140 --> 09:01.673
to have an abortion.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.176
You never know, Karen.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.944
Just because
we have a black president

09:05.979 --> 09:08.213
doesn't mean
we talk about that shit.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.450
- She looks so happy.
- Yeah, she does.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.119
I have <i>never</i> been that happy.

09:14.154 --> 09:17.156
Oh. Just because she doesn't
know what's ahead of her.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.657
Well...

09:18.691 --> 09:20.492
What if this is it?

09:20.527 --> 09:23.996
What if this is my last chance
at being truly happy

09:24.030 --> 09:26.765
and I'm just snuffing it out
because it's inconvenient?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.268
Marce, you know what?

09:29.302 --> 09:31.970
You've changed this appointment
a bunch of times.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.739
I think you need
to face the fact

09:33.773 --> 09:36.975
that there's a part of you
that wants to have a baby.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.411
But that's the thing...
I don't.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.247
I hate kids.
They're annoying little shits.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.183
- Shh.
- It's a terrible burden.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.351
Runkle?

09:46.386 --> 09:47.920
Marcy Runkle?

09:47.954 --> 09:50.589
What do you want to do, baby?

09:50.623 --> 09:53.125
Marcy Runkle?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.209
Wow. Look at you.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.211
What are you...
You're such a regular,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.379
you just walk on in,
they slide you your drink,

10:14.414 --> 10:16.081
no questions asked?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.516
Membership has its privileges,
lady.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.817
Oh.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.620
And I have no shame.
I need this drink.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.423
And I will need another
shortly thereafter.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.158
Bad day?

10:26.192 --> 10:28.260
Medium shitty, yeah.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.995
I hear that.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.531
No stranger to misery, are ya?

10:32.565 --> 10:35.801
I like that in a woman
sitting alone at a bar.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.269
Tell me all your troubles.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.804
Tell me what ails you.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.173
No. It's just a bunch
of boring kid stuff.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.642
I got some of that shit too.

10:43.676 --> 10:44.877
- That's not a line?
- No, no, no.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.879
I got plenty of boring,
angsty kid shit

10:46.913 --> 10:48.680
that keeps me awake at night.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.115
At least until I pass out.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.950
Hmm.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.785
Boy? Girl?

10:53.820 --> 10:56.021
Girl makes it sound
so pleasant.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.856
I have one big
pain-in-the-ass

10:57.891 --> 10:59.224
teenage daughter.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.827
Oh, my God.
That's the worst.

11:01.861 --> 11:04.229
- Word.
- Hmm.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.565
Well, here's to, uh...

11:06.599 --> 11:08.367
Difficult daughters.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.369
Cheers.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.204
And, uh...

11:12.238 --> 11:14.473
Here's to mothers
who drink with strangers.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.675
Ah, cheers, cheers.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.442
Good evening.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.277
I'm sorry.
The gate was open.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.413
No, I'm sorry.
About everything.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.348
I'm Peggy,
your real estate agent.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.749
Right, right.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.418
Marcy says nice things
about you.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.387
Well...I'm not sure
she will anymore.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.457
Why's that?

12:05.491 --> 12:07.259
Well, don't kill
the messenger, but...

12:07.293 --> 12:09.094
The house has fallen
out of escrow.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.129
Of course it has!

12:11.164 --> 12:12.431
The buyers couldn't get a loan.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.433
Of course they couldn't.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.369
It looks like it's time
to put it back up on the market.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.838
Okay. Um...Well, uh...

12:19.872 --> 12:21.773
I-I'll talk to Marcy,

12:21.808 --> 12:24.710
and we'll get back to you.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.778
Okay.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.718
What adult film
were you watching?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.586
Excuse me?

12:34.621 --> 12:36.655
You were watching
pornography, weren't you?

12:36.689 --> 12:38.824
I was. Yes.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.592
What kind?

12:42.195 --> 12:43.929
Oh, you must think
I'm such a slut.

12:43.963 --> 12:45.230
No, no, no, not at all.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.299
You must.
Call me one... I insist.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.734
- Oh, you like that.
- Uh-huh.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.569
Okay. Oh, you're such
a fucking slut.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.570
Oh!

12:51.604 --> 12:52.904
Ow! What the fuck?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.506
You can choke me
if you want to.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.208
No, no, I'm really
not into that.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.977
I had a bad experience with
autoerotic asphyxia recently.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.479
Really?
Tell me all about it.

13:00.513 --> 13:04.049
- Some other time, okay?
- I just wanna feel something!

13:04.083 --> 13:05.884
Oh!
Ohh!

13:05.918 --> 13:08.220
Pretend my father
could walk in at any second.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.522
- This is my house.
- Just pretend!

13:10.556 --> 13:12.224
Okay, okay, okay.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.359
I think I hear your father
in the hallway.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.328
Oh, no, I wanna stop,
but I can't!

13:16.362 --> 13:19.631
Your big black cock
feels so good!

13:19.666 --> 13:21.967
Yeah? That's him.
There he is.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.835
I see him coming in the room.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.638
Daddy, no!
I'm a big girl now.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.174
- Is he still here?
- No, he went to get his gun.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.610
Aah!

13:33.880 --> 13:35.814
He's gonna kill
both of us, Charlie.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.650
Daddy doesn't like it
when I fuck the slaves.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.925
Oh, God,
that was fucking intense.

13:46.959 --> 13:50.028
I almost wanted
to fuck you to death.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.130
But in a good way, you know?

13:54.967 --> 13:57.336
Whoo!

13:57.370 --> 13:59.504
Yes.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.006
You know what I like about you?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.675
Hmm?

14:03.710 --> 14:05.444
I mean, aside from the fact

14:05.478 --> 14:08.013
that you're like seven different
kinds of naked right now.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.215
Oh, my God.

14:10.249 --> 14:13.352
Do you have any idea
how nice that sounds?

14:13.386 --> 14:16.388
You know how long it's been
since a guy has said that to me?

14:16.422 --> 14:18.156
I'm sorry, go ahead.
What were you gonna say?

14:18.191 --> 14:21.526
- What do you like about me?
- You're very age-appropriate.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.398
Wow. You really know
how to piss all over

14:26.432 --> 14:28.400
- a girl's happy buzz.
- No, no, that's a good thing.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.769
I think it means maybe
I'm growin' the fuck up.

14:32.972 --> 14:35.407
- That's very good for you.
- Yep.

14:38.611 --> 14:43.014
But I am leaving for
New York in a couple days.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.282
I didn't mean to suggest

14:44.317 --> 14:45.817
that we had a future
or anything.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.019
You really are quite
the romantic, aren't you?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.088
Fuck. Everything's
coming out wrong this morning.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.390
I know.
Next thing you know,

14:51.424 --> 14:53.325
you're gonna say something
less than flattering

14:53.359 --> 14:56.161
- about my ass.
- Nope. No way.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.063
That thing is bulletproof.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.665
That is an ass
wrapped in kevlar.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.234
If you said to me, "Hank...

15:02.268 --> 15:03.902
All you can do right now
is eat that ass,"

15:03.936 --> 15:06.972
I would put on a lobster bib
and eat that ass.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.341
For hours.
With gusto.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.544
Thank you.
My ass thanks you.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.246
Your ass is welcome.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.017
And don't worry.
I had a little bit of fun.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.353
A little bit of fun it was.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.622
And, uh, I think that
we should do it again.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.590
'Cause you know...

15:25.625 --> 15:27.559
I'm here a couple times a year,

15:27.593 --> 15:28.960
checking up on my daughter.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.562
Yeah?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.063
What does she do?

15:43.876 --> 15:45.377
Aah!

15:45.411 --> 15:46.778
Not a good time.

15:46.813 --> 15:47.913
Don't worry, girly man.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.714
I'm all about
the work right now.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.149
Yeah, well,
I've kinda got some...

15:51.184 --> 15:53.952
- Company.
- Oh...I see.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.922
It's cool.
I know we're not exclusive.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.690
I see other people too,
you know?

15:58.724 --> 16:01.259
Mm. Yeah, well,
I know that.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.061
Course you do.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.931
Yeah, but like...
How many?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.599
I'm not some big
fucking slut, Hank.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.234
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm not judging.

16:09.268 --> 16:10.802
I'm just...
I'm just curious.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.771
Well, I did sleep with
Eddie Nero.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.440
Gross!
That is disgusting!

16:15.475 --> 16:16.908
He poops on people.

16:16.943 --> 16:20.245
And he took a man
in his mouth once.

16:22.782 --> 16:23.915
Okay, come on.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.383
I need to go over
today's pages.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.853
I can't say this shit.
It's all exposition.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.224
I'm gonna give you my notes,

16:32.258 --> 16:34.259
and I have to go meet
my mother for breakfast.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.694
Your mother?

16:35.728 --> 16:37.128
Yeah, she's in town
from New York.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.763
She comes in every once
in a while to check on me

16:38.798 --> 16:40.432
and make sure I'm grounded.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.300
Your mom.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.902
Uh...

16:43.936 --> 16:45.470
Are you having a stroke?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.372
- Eh...
- You sound kind of retarded

16:47.406 --> 16:49.875
- all of a sudden.
- Mama.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.910
I saw we go once more,
'cause you know, I do not think

16:51.944 --> 16:54.679
that I sucked enough of
your dick last night.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.748
Sasha!

16:56.782 --> 16:58.183
Mom?

16:58.217 --> 17:00.018
- Mom?
- Uh...

17:00.052 --> 17:02.354
You fucked my mom?

17:02.388 --> 17:03.889
Oh!

17:03.923 --> 17:06.590
Dude!
That was seriously uncool!

17:08.194 --> 17:11.363
I think I... I gotta go
after her.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.597
Yeah, I think you better put on

17:12.632 --> 17:13.999
some clothes first, though.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.667
Oh! Good idea.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.538
I...H-how
do you know my daughter?

17:19.571 --> 17:21.071
I'm kinda writing
something for her.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.840
- Poor baby.
- Yeah, it turns out

17:22.875 --> 17:24.742
she's really quite
the fucking diva, huh?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.044
No. Poor baby her.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.579
It doesn't matter
how old you get,

17:27.613 --> 17:29.414
it's always gonna be
really weird

17:29.448 --> 17:31.850
to see your mother
in a sexual situation.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.184
Yeah. Especially
when you've already

17:33.219 --> 17:35.887
been with the awesome dude
your mom just boned.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.223
- Right.
- Yeah.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.227
- What?
- What?

17:42.261 --> 17:44.195
I'm sorry, did you just say
what I think you said,

17:44.230 --> 17:45.797
which is that you
slept with my daughter?

17:45.831 --> 17:46.965
No, no, no.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.133
No, you're lying now,
because you did.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.467
You misunderstood.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.437
I was merely talking about
writers and actresses

17:52.471 --> 17:54.105
and Marilyn Monroe
and Arthur Miller

17:54.140 --> 17:57.075
and how that shit
never seems to work out.

17:57.109 --> 17:58.443
She's a fucking kid!

17:58.477 --> 18:00.145
You fucked my fucking kid.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.048
That's not very age-appropriate,
now is it, you asshole?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.783
Touche.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.790
Sasha, dear...Hello.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.225
Can you come out and play?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.928
It's quite warm out here.
Do you know why?

18:16.963 --> 18:20.031
Because we're burning money.
It's a bonfire of cash.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.436
I'm fucked.
My career is over.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.439
Settle down, Alfred Bitchcock.
Let me try.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.674
You didn't sleep with her,
did you?

18:29.709 --> 18:33.178
No way. That's what
the extras are for.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.679
Sasha.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.981
It's Henry Moody.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.983
The writer.
Remember me?

18:38.017 --> 18:40.585
The polisher of your
crackling exposition.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.455
I'd like a word
with you, please.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.190
One word.

18:46.993 --> 18:47.959
Ah.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.430
If it's any consolation,

18:52.465 --> 18:55.200
your mother smacked me
upside the head pretty good.

18:55.234 --> 18:58.269
And my balls are killing me.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.005
I'm just grossed out right now.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.874
Well, that's...
that's pretty normal.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.609
How would you know?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.211
Well, believe it or not,

19:06.245 --> 19:08.847
I once bumped uglies with my
daughter's boyfriend's mother.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.116
That was a terrible time.
We got through it, though.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.550
This too shall pass.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.252
Do you know what
the worst part is?

19:14.286 --> 19:16.554
No.
But tell me.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.026
I was really starting
to like you.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.961
Oh.
Well...

19:22.995 --> 19:24.362
Despite the fact that I am

19:24.397 --> 19:26.197
this swirling black hole
of chaos,

19:26.232 --> 19:28.199
I am pretty fucking awesome
sometimes.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.972
- Best sex of my life.
- Really?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.306
Better than Eddie Nero?

19:35.341 --> 19:37.676
- Weirdest sex of my life.
- I don't wanna know.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.544
- Do I?
- No. You don't.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.781
- I'm still haunted by it.
- Hmm!

19:42.815 --> 19:45.650
- The things he made me do.
- Jesus!

19:45.685 --> 19:47.719
Hey, don't blame your mom...

19:47.753 --> 19:49.921
Because she didn't know
anything,

19:49.955 --> 19:51.990
and don't take it out
on these good people out there.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.925
They work their fucking
asses off.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.594
You should be happy
you're Sasha fucking Bingham,

19:56.629 --> 19:58.663
America's sweetheart,
the girl next door,

19:58.698 --> 20:00.131
the dirty girl next door.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.967
That's the bestest kind.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.803
Uh-oh.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.972
Mmm...

20:08.007 --> 20:10.508
- Weird?
- Oddly, no.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.278
But I'm really good
at compartmentalizing shit.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.420
You are one dirty cop.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.090
Sometimes I hate
my conscience...

20:25.124 --> 20:26.858
Whoa!

20:26.892 --> 20:28.960
But right now it's telling me

20:28.994 --> 20:30.962
that this may not be
the best idea.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.797
Yeah?
Well, it's the only way

20:32.832 --> 20:34.632
you're gonna get me
back out there.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.868
Oh, well.
In that case...

20:45.911 --> 20:46.945
Hey!

20:49.682 --> 20:50.749
Well...

20:54.754 --> 20:57.288
This is a fine
how-do-you-do.

21:07.399 --> 21:09.367
We need to talk business,
Marcy.

21:09.401 --> 21:11.236
What?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.972
Okay.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.875
I mean, if you're
gonna do it, just do it.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.511
I'm a man.
Sorta.

21:19.545 --> 21:22.514
I mean, I-I can take it.
I think.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.816
What the fuck are you
talking about, Stu?

21:24.850 --> 21:27.819
It's just you're so quiet,
and that is weird.

21:27.853 --> 21:31.322
I mean, usually
you're yakking up a storm and...

21:31.357 --> 21:34.626
I've become quite fond of
that obscene verbal diarrhea.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.394
That's lovely.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.229
And disgusting, Stu.
Thanks.

21:38.264 --> 21:39.697
In my experience,

21:39.732 --> 21:41.733
when a woman has run out
of things to say to me,

21:41.767 --> 21:43.101
done.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.804
Time to throw another
ex-wife on the fire.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.006
I wasn't planning on
breaking up with you, Stu.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.975
Not anytime soon, anyway.

21:51.010 --> 21:54.879
Well, I'm guessing
you're not moving in with me.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.148
Look, man, we could talk about

21:57.183 --> 22:00.318
the shacking up shit later,
okay?

22:02.688 --> 22:06.491
But I do...have to be honest with you.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.660
It's my penis, isn't it?

22:08.694 --> 22:10.495
- What?
- The size.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.997
It hurts you, doesn't it?
God damn it!

22:13.032 --> 22:15.400
No! Your penis
is fine, Stu.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.001
Fine?
Fine?

22:17.036 --> 22:20.071
Yes.
Fine. In a good way.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.706
In the best possible way.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.175
I mean, and I've seen some
weird, fucked-up wangs

22:24.210 --> 22:26.144
in my day, so good on you.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.213
Okay.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.748
Then honesty it is...
Okay?

22:30.783 --> 22:32.584
Come on, baby.
Go for it.

22:32.618 --> 22:33.952
I'm all ears.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.958
I'm pregnant.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.343
Oh, God, Stu.
Please don't cry.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.778
No. It's not what you think!

23:00.813 --> 23:04.048
Not what I think?
It's not a fucking miracle?

23:04.083 --> 23:07.518
- Hardly.
- I'm gonna be a father!

23:07.553 --> 23:08.820
No. Stu! Stuart!

23:08.854 --> 23:11.189
You are not letting me tell you
what's going on.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.624
You mean you're not keeping it?

23:12.658 --> 23:14.726
- You're gonna get rid of it?
- No. I'm keeping it.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.960
Oh, thank God, thank God.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.428
I thought about doing the deed,

23:17.463 --> 23:19.097
but I couldn't
go through with it.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.099
But there is this other thing.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.133
Ow! What?

23:22.167 --> 23:24.869
- Charlie.
- Runkle? Oh, God!

23:24.904 --> 23:26.371
I didn't even think of that.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.939
Oh, my God,
he must be so upset!

23:27.973 --> 23:29.274
Poor bastard!

23:29.308 --> 23:31.643
Well...

23:31.677 --> 23:32.644
Ah!

23:32.678 --> 23:34.078
It's mother!

23:34.113 --> 23:36.247
- Oh.
- What am I gonna tell her?

23:36.282 --> 23:38.716
I gotta tell her
the truth, obviously.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.718
- Obviously.
- Hello, mother?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.654
Guess what.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.756
I'm gonna be a father.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.257
Yeah!

23:46.292 --> 23:49.994

the goddamn Christmas miracle!

They're just
a terrible burden, aren't they?

24:13.953 --> 24:15.553
Ever feel like
you're losing the war?

24:15.587 --> 24:18.589
Um, yeah. I think that
I'm in touch with that emotion.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.925
What the fuck

24:22.394 --> 24:23.728
Hope for the best.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.797

24:25.831 --> 24:27.465
Set a good example.

24:27.499 --> 24:28.733
I don't know...
just embrace the fact

24:28.767 --> 24:30.635
that we're all a bunch
of fucking hypocrites.

24:30.669 --> 24:31.769
True dat.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.005
Oh.

24:34.039 --> 24:36.474
- I still hate you.
- I know, I know.

24:36.508 --> 24:39.911
But I need you right now,
because I'm in over my head

24:39.945 --> 24:41.779
and I feel like
I'm losing my shit.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.048
Honey...Come here.
It's okay.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.384
Listen.

24:46.418 --> 24:49.320
What say you to a couple of

24:49.355 --> 24:50.722
room service burgers

24:50.756 --> 24:52.757
and an $18 hotel movie?

24:52.791 --> 24:54.625
That sounds
pretty fucking awesome.

24:54.660 --> 24:55.994
Can I come?

24:56.028 --> 24:57.495
I'm not talking to you
right now.

24:57.529 --> 24:59.597
Sure.
I get it.

24:59.631 --> 25:00.865
But if I were,

25:00.899 --> 25:03.634
I'd probably apologize
for my behavior today.

25:03.669 --> 25:07.505
Well, if you were actually
speaking to me

25:07.539 --> 25:09.474
and you actually
said something like that,

25:09.508 --> 25:12.844
I might even respond
by saying that I deserved it.

25:12.878 --> 25:17.982
And maybe I'd even apologize
and say that I was sorry...

25:18.017 --> 25:19.617
For everything.

25:19.651 --> 25:22.553
- Maybe?
- Definitely.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.057
I'll see you upstairs.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.092
Yes. I'll be up
in a second.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.005
- You know, it's funny.
- Hmm?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.307
It doesn't matter
how rich, how famous.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.009
They're all just little kids

25:45.044 --> 25:47.111
who need their mommies
and their daddies.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.414
Here's hoping.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.283
And I know I don't
really know you that well,

25:52.317 --> 25:53.651
so...this might be
out of line,

25:53.685 --> 25:55.253
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.454
- You don't have to.
- I'm gonna.

25:56.488 --> 25:57.688
All right.

25:57.723 --> 26:01.259
You...are coming
dangerously close

26:01.293 --> 26:03.528
to the point of no return.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.630
What does that mean?

26:05.664 --> 26:07.732
This thing
that you got going...

26:07.766 --> 26:12.270

26:13.739 --> 26:16.808
It's last call, pal.

26:16.842 --> 26:20.645
You should get out
while the getting's good.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.147
What if it's already too late?

26:24.450 --> 26:25.950
Oh. Well...

26:25.984 --> 26:27.718
Could be.
I don't know.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.720
Certainly doesn't mean
that you shouldn't try.
