I love your show.

I love it. Seriously,

01:03.583 --> 01:04.959
I want to have sex
with your show.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.458
You know what
my fantasy is?

01:06.458 --> 01:07.917
I wake up tomorrow

01:07.917 --> 01:09.959
and I've got your show
on my network.

01:09.959 --> 01:12.125
What,
us come to L.A.?

01:12.125 --> 01:13.792
How hard can it be?
You've already written
the scripts.

01:13.792 --> 01:15.375
It's perfect
the way it is.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.583
You work
20 minutes a day,

01:16.583 --> 01:17.875
the rest of the time,

01:17.875 --> 01:19.542
you can screw
in the pool.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.750
You hear that?
We'd get a pool.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.375
Let's talk
about casting.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.125
Well, we already
have Julian

01:25.125 --> 01:27.125
committed to recreate
the role of Lyman.

01:27.125 --> 01:28.834
So, that's half
the battle right there.

01:28.834 --> 01:30.709
Merc loves the show,
Julian is the show.

01:30.709 --> 01:32.166
There is a chance

01:32.166 --> 01:35.583
Merc may not have
actually seen your show.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.875
What?
I'm not saying that
he hasn't seen it.

01:37.875 --> 01:39.625
Has he seen it?
No.

01:39.625 --> 01:40.917
We just found out

01:40.917 --> 01:43.250
that there is
an actor available--

01:43.250 --> 01:45.000

01:45.000 --> 01:47.041

to come back to TV.

a different way to go.

probably wrong for it.

02:42.917 --> 02:45.333
He is very funny.
He really is.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.458
I even liked him
in that monkey movie.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.917
What monkey movie?

02:48.917 --> 02:50.667
Please, just take
the meeting--

02:50.667 --> 02:52.375
as a courtesy.

02:52.375 --> 02:55.083

wants to get Matt

02:55.083 --> 02:56.625
over here
to the network,

02:56.625 --> 02:58.834
and so far, this is
the only project

02:58.834 --> 03:00.208
he's interested
in doing.

03:00.208 --> 03:02.500
Matt LeBlanc wants
to do our show?

Are you kidding?

03:03.500 --> 03:05.250
Dying to.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.667

England, shooting a movie.

you'll take the meeting?

Awesome. Also...

03:22.500 --> 03:24.834

a little invitation.

a dinner party

03:27.000 --> 03:29.125

we have the financing?

we're looking at
another location,

at all awkward.

something.

Would you go to
a restaurant

your own sushi?

finish that before we--

at a boarding school.

a history teacher.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.125
Honey, these are those
English writers--

10:38.125 --> 10:39.875
Sean and Beverly...

10:39.875 --> 10:42.083
Lincoln.
I know!

10:42.083 --> 10:43.417
So nice to meet you.

10:43.417 --> 10:44.750
Welcome to L.A.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.291
So, are you ready to go
back to England yet?

10:46.291 --> 10:47.333
[Both laugh]

10:47.333 --> 10:48.959
Hardly.
In a heartbeat.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.875
Well, if there's
anything you need,

10:50.875 --> 10:52.542
please call me.

10:52.542 --> 10:53.959
And not, like,
an L.A. "call me".

10:53.959 --> 10:56.458
I mean it.
Make sure this one
gives you my number.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.959
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.375
Ooh. Arthur and Madelyn
just got here.

11:00.375 --> 11:04.125
Oh, would you excuse me
for a moment?

11:07.291 --> 11:09.959
She's lovely.
She's the best.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.667
And blind.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.375
Uh...yes.

11:13.375 --> 11:14.875
Two years now.
Really?

11:14.875 --> 11:17.417
We were in Hawaii.
She ate some kind
of bad fish.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.375
Boom! Has a toxic
reaction,

11:19.375 --> 11:21.083
goes into a coma
for two weeks.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.250
When she comes
out of it--blind.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.667
Oh, my God.
That's horrifying.

11:25.667 --> 11:26.834
Yeah, that was not
a good vacation.

11:26.834 --> 11:29.500
Plus, it rained
practically every day.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.000
Well, Kauai.
That's why it's so lush.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.583
Yes, well...

11:34.583 --> 11:37.291
for someone who's
only been sightless
for a short time,

11:37.291 --> 11:39.417
she seems
amazingly capable.

11:39.417 --> 11:40.792
She's worked so hard.

11:40.792 --> 11:42.500
She's my hero.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.500
I mean...
she falls down.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.834
A lot.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.667
For some reason, she's
not doing it tonight.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.542
But you should
see her shins.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.083
Bruises--sheesh!

11:52.083 --> 11:54.458
[Laughs] Whenever
I offer to help her,

11:54.458 --> 11:57.208
she's, like,
"No, I have to
do it myself."

11:57.208 --> 12:00.250
I'm, like, "But it's
gonna take so much
longer that way."

12:00.250 --> 12:01.834
But she's gotta do it.

12:01.834 --> 12:05.208
It takes us forever to
get out of the house.

12:05.208 --> 12:07.458
Well,
on the other hand,

12:07.458 --> 12:09.041
she shops less.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.250
[Laughs]

12:11.250 --> 12:13.834
[Nervous laughter]

12:16.375 --> 12:18.583
Look at that view.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.250
Ooh.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.458
Hi, kids!
Hi, Carol.

12:22.458 --> 12:23.875
So, having fun?

12:23.875 --> 12:25.583
Absolutely.
Hmm.

12:25.583 --> 12:27.000
Ooh, those look good.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.583
We have a Kobe beef
on a toasted brioche,

12:28.583 --> 12:30.000
topped with
crispy potato

12:30.000 --> 12:31.291
and a horseradish
crÃ¨me fraÃ®che.

12:31.291 --> 12:33.583
Mmm, not saying no
to that.

12:33.583 --> 12:36.000
[Laughter]

12:36.000 --> 12:38.917
Oh, um, you know,
I'm--I'm fine.

12:38.917 --> 12:40.750
Oh, come on.

12:40.750 --> 12:43.667
At a certain point,
I said screw it.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.375
I'm never gonna
look like them.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.166
I mean, I don't want
to look like them.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.750
Life's too short.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.375
Oh. Thank you.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.583
Mmm. Mmm!

13:09.917 --> 13:12.083
Mmm. Yum.

13:12.083 --> 13:15.792
[Laughs]
Mmm. So...

13:15.792 --> 13:17.083
have you guys
said hi to Matt yet?

13:17.083 --> 13:19.083
Oh, Christ.
He's here?

13:19.083 --> 13:21.083
Yeah, out in the garden.
You should go say hello.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.625
Why?

13:22.625 --> 13:24.458
Maybe because he's
the star of our show?

13:24.458 --> 13:26.083
[Whimpers]
What?

13:26.083 --> 13:28.417
When you say it,
it makes it real.

13:28.417 --> 13:31.083
Oh, come on.
He's gonna be great.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.625
Now, get out there
and make nice.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.875
Come on.
You gotta do it.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.834
No one's here
to have fun.

13:41.542 --> 13:42.917
Oh, God.

13:42.917 --> 13:44.291
Be nice.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.375
You speak first, then.
OK.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.291
Excuse me. Hey!
It's you guys!

13:48.291 --> 13:50.291
Hello, sir.
Matt.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.750
Hi. You know what
I've been doing
the last few days?

13:52.750 --> 13:53.959
Texting?

13:53.959 --> 13:55.667
Watching tapes
of your show.

13:55.667 --> 13:58.458
It's fantastic!
Really?

13:58.458 --> 14:00.667
Like you don't know.
Oh, my God.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.500
So funny.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.750
And smart.
Jesus, I love it!

14:04.750 --> 14:07.041
You're serious?
Uh...yeah!

14:07.041 --> 14:09.542
And it's totally not
History Boys.

14:09.542 --> 14:10.709
Thank you.

14:10.709 --> 14:11.834
I love the writing...

14:11.834 --> 14:14.083
the characters.
Oh, wow.

14:14.083 --> 14:15.667
And we've got to do it
like you did it
over there--

14:15.667 --> 14:18.625
casting real kids,
not TV kids.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.959
That's the key.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.333
That is the key.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.583
Oh, and the librarian?

14:22.583 --> 14:24.166
Nicola.
Yeah.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.917
Great part.

14:25.917 --> 14:27.458
You guys have
anyone in mind yet?

14:27.458 --> 14:29.542
No. The network
has sent us a list.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.959
[American accent]
People they're really
excited about.

14:31.959 --> 14:34.000
Like who?
We didn't know
any of them.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.166
A couple of Heathers,
a bunch of Jennifers,

14:37.166 --> 14:38.709
somebody Dushku.

14:38.709 --> 14:41.041
Yeah, well,
don't let them force you

14:41.041 --> 14:42.917
to cast anyone
you don't want.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.250
All right.
I mean it.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.834
If they start
pushing you around,
let me be the bad guy.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.583
Really?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.125
It's a lot harder
for them to fuck with me

14:52.125 --> 14:53.542
than fuck with you.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.709
Besides, Merc and I
go way back.

14:55.709 --> 14:57.417
I've known him since
he ran NBC Sports

14:57.417 --> 14:58.709
and used to get me
Laker Girls.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.583
Wow. Good to know.

15:00.583 --> 15:03.166
Yeah, we gotta get
someone great for Nicola.

15:03.166 --> 15:06.333
She's got to be
strong and smart

15:06.333 --> 15:08.500
and classy.
Right.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.458
And also beautiful--

15:10.458 --> 15:12.458
but, like,
in a real way.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.250
She can't act, can she?

15:14.250 --> 15:16.875
What--That's--
I don't--Ha ha!

15:16.875 --> 15:18.959
[Snorts, coughs]

15:18.959 --> 15:21.083
[Honking laugh]

15:21.083 --> 15:22.875
That's her--classy.

15:22.875 --> 15:25.083
I believe I have
Chardonnay up my nose.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.291
[Coughs]

15:26.291 --> 15:27.375
Dinner is being served.

15:27.375 --> 15:29.417
Oh, thank God.

15:29.417 --> 15:31.041
[Coughs]

15:32.250 --> 15:33.875
Well, who saw
that coming?

15:33.875 --> 15:36.291
He's actually charming.
How did that happen?

15:36.291 --> 15:37.667
It's like a magic trick.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.208
Does he seem taller
than the other day?

15:39.208 --> 15:40.709
Yes, and smarter.

15:40.709 --> 15:42.333
I had no idea
he was so smart.

15:42.333 --> 15:43.750
He's still wrong
for the part.

15:43.750 --> 15:46.000
He's totally wrong.
But he has such
nice hair.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.792
Ohh.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.625
I brought an extra suitcase

15:51.625 --> 15:53.500
filled with nothing but toys.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.083
When we got to the orphanage
and opened it,

15:56.083 --> 16:00.083
the children just
sat there, uncertain.

16:00.083 --> 16:02.792
One of the nuns told us
that some of these children

16:02.792 --> 16:04.750
had never actually
seen a toy,

16:04.750 --> 16:06.417
much less had one
of their own.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.792
It just makes you
appreciate so much.

16:08.792 --> 16:11.959
One of the things
I brought was a doll

16:11.959 --> 16:13.166
that I'd given my niece
for Christmas.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.458
She just played
with it once

16:14.458 --> 16:15.875
and had gotten bored
with it.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.041
Well...

16:18.041 --> 16:19.959
I handed it
to this little girl,

16:19.959 --> 16:22.542
and she clutched it
to her chest

16:22.542 --> 16:26.291
and told one of the nuns
it was the best day
of her life.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.792
Oh! And that was Togo.

16:29.792 --> 16:32.291
I mean, then we were
off to Zambia.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.917
The children there--Ohh.

16:36.709 --> 16:38.834
MATT: You guys have kids?

16:38.834 --> 16:40.417
No. Do you?

16:40.417 --> 16:41.875
Two boys.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.500
Oh. Didn't realize
you were married.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.667
Heh heh. Not anymore.

16:45.667 --> 16:47.041
He said, vehemently.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.667
It was not one of
the good ones.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.792
No?
No.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.667
We never
should've done it.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.458
We were totally wrong
for each other, like--

16:55.458 --> 16:57.375
Oil and water?

16:57.375 --> 17:00.667
More like oil
and something that sleeps
with oil's best friend.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.083
BEVERLY: Oh, my God.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.000
I don't understand
how women do that.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.625
With two children...

17:06.625 --> 17:08.709
No, no, no, no.
It was me.

17:08.709 --> 17:10.333
I slept with
her best friend.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.000
I was not
a good husband.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.792
Heh. Apparently not.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.041
But I am
a very good dad.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.709
That's Aiden, and the
little one's Michael.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.000
Oh, they're gorgeous.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.875
They seem very sweet.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.542
They can
drive you crazy.

17:25.542 --> 17:27.875
Don't ever ask them what
a dinosaur sounds like,

17:27.875 --> 17:30.542
especially if
you're in a car.
[Laughs]

17:30.542 --> 17:32.709
But, you know,
they're pretty amazing.

17:32.709 --> 17:35.250
They're the best thing
I've ever done in my life.

17:40.667 --> 17:41.875
Anyway...

17:41.875 --> 17:43.709
[Laughs]

17:50.208 --> 17:51.792
It's a Mark Wilson.

17:51.792 --> 17:53.125
No, I know.
But an early one.

17:53.125 --> 17:55.417
Before he decided
the only color
was brown.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.375
[Laughs]

17:57.375 --> 17:59.083
Amazing collection, huh?

17:59.083 --> 18:00.250
Oh, brilliant.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.709
You should see--

18:02.709 --> 18:04.000
in the master bedroom,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.709
there is a Nevelson that--

18:05.709 --> 18:07.250
it should be
in a museum.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.458
Really?
Mm.

18:09.458 --> 18:11.750
Are we allowed up there?
Probably not.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.458
Um...

18:15.458 --> 18:18.709
would you mind
not mentioning to anyone

18:18.709 --> 18:21.542
that I've been
in the master bedroom?

18:21.542 --> 18:23.291
All right.

18:24.417 --> 18:25.750
Oh.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.250
I just wouldn't
want anyone

18:27.250 --> 18:28.750
to get the wrong
impression.

18:28.750 --> 18:29.834
Absolutely.

18:29.834 --> 18:32.083
"She's sleeping
with her boss."

18:32.083 --> 18:34.083
[Laughs] Wouldn't want
to be that girl.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.208
No-ho-ho-ho.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.542
Especially since
his wife is blind.

18:39.542 --> 18:41.583
Right. Ha!

18:41.583 --> 18:43.083
Because that would
make me--

18:43.083 --> 18:45.375
A monster.
Yes.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.375
[Laughs]

18:46.375 --> 18:47.959
Rarr!

18:47.959 --> 18:49.625
[Both laugh]

18:49.625 --> 18:51.458
I don't--

18:51.458 --> 18:54.959
[Laughing]

18:54.959 --> 18:56.625
[Clears throat]

18:56.625 --> 18:58.458
Heh.

18:58.458 --> 19:00.083
Whew.

19:01.291 --> 19:03.208
Even if it started
before she went--

19:03.208 --> 19:04.583
Still not good.
Right.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.917
Yeah.

19:11.041 --> 19:12.750
And here
they're pretending

19:12.750 --> 19:14.417
they don't know I'm
taking their picture.

19:14.417 --> 19:16.375
But look--they're both
giving me the finger.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.834
I assume their father
taught them that.

19:17.834 --> 19:20.083
Before they could
even talk.

19:20.083 --> 19:22.959
I've never actually seen
a "fuck you" finger
that tiny.

19:22.959 --> 19:25.125
Pretty cute, huh?
[Laughs]

19:25.125 --> 19:26.959
That's one of the things
I'm looking forward to
with our thing--

19:26.959 --> 19:28.333
working with kids.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.834
Talk to me
three weeks in.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.166
They're like sticky
animals with agents.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.834
I gotta say,
I'm so excited.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.166
It's an awesome part.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.625
Thank you.

19:37.625 --> 19:39.125
I've never played
anyone like him.

19:39.125 --> 19:41.208
I'm sure.

19:41.208 --> 19:44.625
Be honest. Did the network
force me down your throats?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.542
Sean would
tell you no.

19:48.542 --> 19:50.834
Sean would be lying.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.709
I'm totally wrong
for it, aren't I?

19:52.709 --> 19:55.333
Spectacularly wrong.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.583
I knew it.
I'm so screwed.

19:58.583 --> 20:00.083
[Laughs]
If it helps,

20:00.083 --> 20:02.041
we're screwed
with you.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.875
Hey, no one likes
to be screwed alone.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.291
Hmm.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.583
So, what do we do?

20:08.583 --> 20:11.917
Uh, I'm not sure.
It's just--

20:11.917 --> 20:13.834
you as the headmaster
of a school--

20:13.834 --> 20:15.333
I know.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.375
I mean, you're obviously
very intelligent.

20:17.375 --> 20:18.458
Really?

20:18.458 --> 20:20.125
Sean and I
were just saying

20:20.125 --> 20:22.417
how smart you are.

20:22.417 --> 20:25.041
Wow. That's a conversation
that doesn't happen a lot.

20:25.041 --> 20:26.333
[Both laugh]

20:26.333 --> 20:29.834
But for this role--

20:29.834 --> 20:31.542
Well, what if I wasn't
the headmaster?

20:31.542 --> 20:33.667
What if I was someone else
at the school?

20:33.667 --> 20:35.291
Um, that--

20:35.291 --> 20:37.333
that would change
the show considerably.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.041
Come on, you gotta
help me here.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.208
I kind of need this
to be a hit.

20:41.208 --> 20:44.417
Or at least something
you can't make fun of
on a talk show.

20:45.917 --> 20:48.166
Um...perhaps.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.083
Good. Perhaps is good.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.208
Perhaps, uh,
you could be--

20:52.208 --> 20:54.417
I don't know--
a history professor

20:54.417 --> 20:56.917
with a passion for
military campaigns.

20:56.917 --> 20:59.583
Or a coach.
A--A coach.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.041
Like a wrestling coach?

21:01.041 --> 21:02.709
Throwing the kids around.

21:02.709 --> 21:04.709
Well, um, see,

21:04.709 --> 21:07.750
that would be a very
different kind of show.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.333
There's a level
of sophistication.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.041
Hmm. Right.
OK, uh...

21:11.041 --> 21:12.667
what about lacrosse?

21:12.667 --> 21:16.417
That's got your whole
sophisticated thing
going there, huh?

21:16.417 --> 21:18.417
Bam!

21:18.417 --> 21:20.291
Heh. Um...

21:20.291 --> 21:22.750
let me talk to Sean,
see what he thinks.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.291
Great. And, hey,
at the end of the day,

21:24.291 --> 21:26.333
it's whatever you guys want.
It's your show.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.000
Thank you.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.709
Are you kidding?
Thank you.

21:29.709 --> 21:32.417
Hey, speaking of kids,
I just saw this documentary--

21:32.417 --> 21:35.500
I just had an interesting
conversation.

21:36.667 --> 21:38.458
Which I agreed
not to share.

21:38.458 --> 21:40.625
So, what are you
talking about here?

21:40.625 --> 21:42.667
Oh, Matt was
about to tell me

21:42.667 --> 21:44.375
about this
documentary.

21:44.375 --> 21:47.208
Oh, yeah. It's about
these kids with
Tourette's syndrome.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.875
You gotta see it.
It's so funny.

21:49.875 --> 21:52.458
Funny?
Oh, my God.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.041
Children
with Tourette's?

21:54.041 --> 21:55.625
I know. I felt
guilty laughing,

21:55.625 --> 21:57.125
but I'm telling you.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.291
They were interviewing
this one little girl--
so cute--

21:59.291 --> 22:01.792
and all of a sudden,
she's, like, "Shit! Shit!

22:01.792 --> 22:04.417
"Shit! Shit!"

22:04.417 --> 22:05.792
[Laughs]

22:05.792 --> 22:08.125
And you found
that funny?

22:08.125 --> 22:09.625
Hey, I said
I felt guilty.

22:09.625 --> 22:11.667
But come on--
little kids cursing?

22:11.667 --> 22:12.917
No?

22:12.917 --> 22:14.625
I need to believe
you're joking.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.000
Uh, no.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.417
What do you say
we find another topic?

22:18.417 --> 22:20.208
You haven't seen it.
I don't need to see it.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.000
Tourette's is
a horrible affliction.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.417
It's not just swearing.
These people suffer

22:24.417 --> 22:26.208
from compulsive facial
and vocal tics.

22:26.208 --> 22:27.417
And there's no cure.

22:27.417 --> 22:29.000
So, I guess you're
the fun one.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.667
Let me ask you
a question.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.333
Carol's having
an affair with Merc.

22:32.333 --> 22:33.917
Who's Carol?

22:33.917 --> 22:35.875
What if one of
your sons had it?

22:35.875 --> 22:37.542
What if your own child
was compelled to say
these terrible things?

22:37.542 --> 22:38.792
Would it be funny then?

22:42.208 --> 22:43.834
It depends on
what he was saying.

22:43.834 --> 22:45.083
[Chuckles]

22:45.083 --> 22:46.583
Did you just laugh?
No.

22:46.583 --> 22:47.959
You did, you laughed.

22:47.959 --> 22:49.750
I didn't, I swear.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.625
[Imitates whip cracking]

22:51.625 --> 22:53.625
Excuse me?
What?

22:53.625 --> 22:55.291
What? That thing.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.667
What thing?

22:56.667 --> 22:58.166
That whippy thing.

22:58.166 --> 22:59.875
Are you implying that
my husband is whipped?

22:59.875 --> 23:01.542
I don't know. Is he?

23:01.542 --> 23:03.750
Right. This is not
the other topic
I was looking for.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.542
When you say "whipped",

23:05.542 --> 23:07.625
what type of "whipped"
are we talking about exactly?

23:07.625 --> 23:09.667
You're an infant.
Just trying to clarify.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.333
Are you trying
to get me to say
the word "pussy"?

23:11.333 --> 23:13.834
I can say "pussy".
Pussy. Pussy.
Pussy! Pussy!

23:13.834 --> 23:16.166
I want to be in
this conversation.

23:19.375 --> 23:21.208
Thank you for coming.
It was lovely to see you again.

23:21.208 --> 23:22.917
Bye, thank you.

23:22.917 --> 23:24.375
Thank you so much
for coming.

23:24.375 --> 23:26.208
You handled that well.
Could you believe him?

23:26.208 --> 23:28.333
Whipped! You're not whipped.
Are you whipped?!

23:28.333 --> 23:31.250
That may not be the tone
you want when you're
asking me that question.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.250
You're not whipped,
are you?

23:33.250 --> 23:35.375
No, darling.
I'm merely browbeaten

23:35.375 --> 23:36.834
and henpecked.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.333
Oh, God, I just want
to get out of here.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.417
Hideous, hideous night.

23:43.417 --> 23:44.750
Oh, is someone there?

23:44.750 --> 23:46.125
It's Sean
and Beverly.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.083
I'm afraid
we have to go.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.375
We had
a wonderful time.

23:49.375 --> 23:51.959
Don't worry.
It gets easier.

23:51.959 --> 23:54.375
Arr! We--We be
goin' now, are we?

23:54.375 --> 23:56.208
And now we're pirates.
Very good.

23:56.208 --> 24:00.125
Matt's been telling me
about the changes
for his character.

24:00.125 --> 24:02.000
What?
Wait till you hear.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.625
Uh, changes?

24:03.625 --> 24:05.750
Yeah, how he's not gonna be
a headmaster anymore.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.250
How's that?

24:07.250 --> 24:08.417
I love that
he's a coach.

24:08.417 --> 24:10.583
A coach?
A lacrosse coach.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.250
MERC: Love it!
That's much more relatable.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.166
Hey, hey, it was
Beverly's idea.

24:15.166 --> 24:18.709
Really?
I never said "coach".

24:18.709 --> 24:21.291
Well, she said
she couldn't see me
as a headmaster.

24:21.291 --> 24:23.041
Did she?

24:23.041 --> 24:25.291
You said it, too.
To you.

24:25.291 --> 24:27.583
What is a headmaster,
anyway?

24:27.583 --> 24:30.208
Do people even know?
Probably not.

24:30.208 --> 24:32.083
We didn't commit
to anything.

24:32.083 --> 24:33.834
Well, commit to it.
It's perfect.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.125
I agree.
She's so smart.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.166
I'm just not sure
about lacrosse.

24:37.166 --> 24:39.625
Is it too lacrossey?
I know what you mean.

24:39.625 --> 24:40.959
How about hockey?
Ooh.

24:40.959 --> 24:42.291
Hockey works.

24:42.291 --> 24:44.125
We could call it Pucks!
I'd watch.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.792
Before we start
measuring for uniforms,

24:45.792 --> 24:46.959
can we all
take a breath?

24:46.959 --> 24:49.125
This is so much better
than your old show.

24:49.125 --> 24:52.250
How would you know?
You've never even
seen our show.

24:57.625 --> 25:00.208
[Laughs] I've seen your show.

25:00.208 --> 25:01.458
Of course
I've seen your show.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.166
Who told you I haven't
seen your show?

25:03.166 --> 25:04.625
I--I don't--

25:04.625 --> 25:06.625
Did you tell them
I haven't seen their show?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.041
Uh, I--

25:10.041 --> 25:12.959
Uh, no. Carol
didn't say it.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.500
I--

25:14.500 --> 25:15.959
I was just trying
to make a joke.

25:15.959 --> 25:17.250
It was a joke.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.792
You...haven't seen
our show!

25:19.792 --> 25:21.709
[Laughs] That's--

25:21.709 --> 25:23.500
I don't get it.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.875
He's the funny one.

25:37.792 --> 25:39.792
What a great night.

25:39.792 --> 25:41.875
Maybe next time
you can shoot someone.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.333
First of all,

25:43.333 --> 25:45.917
I did not tell him
he could play a coach.

25:45.917 --> 25:48.375
Did you tell him that
he couldn't play a coach?
No.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.458
Did you mention it would
change the show completely?

25:50.458 --> 25:52.542
That we'd have to throw
out all our scripts?

25:52.542 --> 25:54.542
He said he would let it
be our decision.

25:54.542 --> 25:56.083
And he very well
might have

25:56.083 --> 25:57.375
if you hadn't
completely
antagonized him

25:57.375 --> 25:59.208
over that bloody
documentary.

25:59.208 --> 26:01.291
What was I supposed to do--
just go along with him?

26:01.291 --> 26:04.375
"Oh, a film about afflicted
children--hilarious!"

26:04.375 --> 26:06.375
Yes! You go along.

26:06.375 --> 26:07.709
That's what
the rest of us do.

26:07.709 --> 26:09.542
We go along.

26:09.542 --> 26:11.166
Because we know that
if you don't go along,

26:11.166 --> 26:12.709
you end up writing
a show called Pucks!

26:16.291 --> 26:18.208
I mean, just once,

26:18.208 --> 26:20.917
could you not make
everything harder?

26:36.291 --> 26:38.709
Evening.
And you're here to see?

26:38.709 --> 26:41.417
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Not tonight, Wallace.

26:41.417 --> 26:43.250
Don't pull that shit
with us.

26:43.250 --> 26:45.125
Now, open the motherfucking,
bloody bastard,

26:45.125 --> 26:47.083
pain in the arse,
dick-cheese-stinking,

26:47.083 --> 26:49.375
dirty, shitty,
wanking, fucking,

26:49.375 --> 26:51.417
bloody, fucking, bastard,

26:51.417 --> 26:54.625
fucking stupid cunt
of a fucking gate!

26:56.250 --> 26:57.875
[Buzz]

26:57.875 --> 26:59.375
Tourette's.
