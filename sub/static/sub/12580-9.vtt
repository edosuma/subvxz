[humming]

00:12.679 --> 00:13.668
[screaming]

00:13.780 --> 00:15.873
I can't stand it anymore!

00:16.149 --> 00:20.142
I'm gonna grab that violin from Connie
and smash it against a fire hydrant.

00:20.253 --> 00:25.088
Bill, she started four-and-a-half beers ago.
She can't possibly go on much longer.

00:25.892 --> 00:29.760
Please, Lord, give her a cramp.
If it's thy will.

00:32.399 --> 00:33.366
[birds chirping]

00:33.633 --> 00:34.600
[violin playing]

00:34.701 --> 00:35.668
Oh.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.362
We're low on beer.

[violin playing]

01:14.207 --> 01:15.765
What you doing, Hank?

01:16.209 --> 01:18.939
Going to the crossroads to sell your soul?

01:19.079 --> 01:23.311
No. I just thought we might want
a musical change of pace in the alley.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.816
I want to hear Puff, the Magic Dragoi,

01:25.919 --> 01:27.853
Play that one. I like it. Play it.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.748
[singing]

01:33.626 --> 01:36.857
Bill, do you have any idea
what that song is about?

01:37.163 --> 01:38.926
It's about a dragon.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.360
We're grown men. Here, how about....

01:47.607 --> 01:48.699
[singing]

01:59.752 --> 02:04.587
Party's over, Hank. It's the music police,
a.k.a. Little Miss Bummer.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.588
Don't stop. I like it.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.656
The only time I heard music like that
was at Disney World...

02:09.762 --> 02:12.230
when we passed
the Country Bear Jamboree.

02:12.365 --> 02:15.163
But my dad pushed me
into the Hall of Presidents.

02:15.268 --> 02:18.396
-Could you play it again?
-Well, sure.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.183
Well, all right then.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.315
Wow! This violin did that?

02:39.659 --> 02:43.322
When you're playing bluegrass,
you call it a fiddle, Connie.

02:43.429 --> 02:44.396
[laughing]

02:44.864 --> 02:46.092
Violin.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.433
[van approaching]

02:47.634 --> 02:48.601
[gasping]

02:54.908 --> 02:55.875
[scoffs]

02:58.044 --> 03:00.911
I gotta go. My dad has this joke.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.913
How do you get
into the Van Cliburn Summer Orchestra?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.143
Practice.

03:05.285 --> 03:08.152
Well, it used to be a joke.
Now he just screams it.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.984
Who's Van Cliburn?

03:12.091 --> 03:15.891
Texas' own Van Cliburn
is a classical pianist...

03:15.995 --> 03:18.896
with a bustling summer camp
in Fort Worth.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.460
We share a birthday.

03:22.702 --> 03:27.332
Kahn's making her play classical, but the
girl's got a natural talent for bluegrass.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.499
Everybody in the alley thought so.

03:29.609 --> 03:32.237
And you know Boomhauer is a music snob.

03:32.345 --> 03:35.280
Well, the strange thing is
people with that much talent...

03:35.381 --> 03:38.475
-rarely amount to anything.
-lnteresting fact.

03:38.818 --> 03:41.810
Connie and I always had a dream
of playing Carnegie Hall...

03:41.921 --> 03:43.855
to showcase our talents.

03:43.957 --> 03:48.291
I'd open with a tight 40-minute set
of observational comedy and poo jokes.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.921
And then she'd close
with a violin concerto for the bluehairs.

03:52.398 --> 03:56.300
But I think fiddling could take Connie
even further than Carnegie Hall.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.563
That's if she grows up pretty enough.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.265
Those Dixie Chicks
have really raised the bar.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.012
Okay! Very good. Much better.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.307
Take a break from your Mozart.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.005
[sighing]

04:11.117 --> 04:13.779
-Thanks, Dad.
-Sure, yeah, yeah, no problem.

04:13.886 --> 04:17.048
And while you're relaxing,
you will read about Mozart!

04:17.322 --> 04:20.349
Learn about the man. Get inside his head.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.923
Any child prodigy can play....

04:24.163 --> 04:27.030
But you only one
who will know what it really mean.

04:27.567 --> 04:28.556
[chuckling] Okay, yeah.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.308
[music playing]

04:39.312 --> 04:40.301
[sighing]

04:40.413 --> 04:42.711
I bought this level at a yard sale.

04:42.815 --> 04:45.113
I'm afraid the price
was too good to be true.

04:45.218 --> 04:48.346
Test it on my stomach.
It's flat as a pancake.

04:48.721 --> 04:49.688
Eh?

04:50.189 --> 04:53.283
Hey, Mr. Hill.
My dad won't be back for an hour.

04:53.393 --> 04:57.159
He's getting his hair dyed.
I wasn't supposed to tell anybody that.

04:57.263 --> 04:59.424
You want to throw down with a hoedown?

04:59.532 --> 05:02.023
-I'll get my guitar.
-I'll get my washboard.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.797
I'll go get my string bass,
which is really a keyboard.

05:04.904 --> 05:06.735
Hey, man. I'm gonna go get my banjo.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.830
Or maybe I'll go
get that little old accordion, man.

05:08.941 --> 05:09.908
What do you think, now?

05:10.743 --> 05:12.574
No, I'll go with the banjo, man.

05:12.679 --> 05:13.907
(Dale) Let's go.

05:14.013 --> 05:15.446
One, two, three.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.858
Hey, man. I'm gonna go now.
I'm gonna take a verse right now.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.527
[singing]

05:50.917 --> 05:54.444
Bobby, put that down.
That's the jug I keep stuff in.

05:59.258 --> 06:01.158
Saw that thing, Connie.

06:03.730 --> 06:04.719
Oh!

06:04.831 --> 06:07.163
Sorry. I didn't mean to get into it.

06:07.266 --> 06:10.394
No, no. It's my fault, Connie.
I told you to saw.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.603
So, you're just going to re-string it, huh?

06:14.707 --> 06:16.265
I told her to throw it out.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.072
Well, this little girl doesn't look
like she could hold a fiddle...

06:19.178 --> 06:20.941
Iet alone break a string.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.311
Hey, how about a little Twiikle, Twiikle?

06:24.317 --> 06:26.376
[playing Twiikle, Twiikle Little Star]

06:32.825 --> 06:35.316
Oh, gee! She's good!

06:35.428 --> 06:37.293
You ever think
about taking her to Branson?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.228
You think she's Branson-good?

06:39.332 --> 06:41.926
Well, hell, yeah.
They got these fiddle contests there.

06:43.603 --> 06:46.037
I used to judge them
till they found out I was taking bribes.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.131
Boy, the best players in the world
go to Branson.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.005
You thinking what I'm thinking?

06:51.110 --> 06:54.204
Could I wear a sundress
and play in my bare feet?

06:54.313 --> 06:56.838
Heck, I might kick off my shoes
and join you.

06:56.949 --> 07:01.147
And we could be your backup band.
The Dale Gribble Bluegrass Experience.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.343
Hmm.

07:02.455 --> 07:05.151
-I like it.
-Oh, no!

07:05.258 --> 07:09.194
I'm gonna be in Fort Worthless
that weekend auditioning for Van Boring.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.495
Well, that's a kick in the teeth. Bobby!

07:13.065 --> 07:14.157
Okay.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.428
[singing]

07:20.173 --> 07:22.471
Stop! Kahn Jr.!

07:22.575 --> 07:24.304
What is that noise you're making?

07:24.410 --> 07:27.004
It sounds like you're killing a seagull
with a bagpipe.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.446
It's bluegrass, Kahn.
Music made in America.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.747
And whether you like it or not,
your daughter's a natural.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.183
And I'm having more fun
than a dog up a bone tree.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.781
That's how you say ""it's fun"" in bluegrass.

07:39.892 --> 07:40.881
[screaming]

07:40.993 --> 07:44.827
That inbred music is designed
so only people with six fingers can play it!

07:44.931 --> 07:49.027
Your path is Van Cliburn Camp
to Harvard to New York Philharmonic.

07:49.135 --> 07:52.593
Not hay wagon to Hee Haw!Time to pack!

07:58.211 --> 07:59.644
We love you, honey.

07:59.745 --> 08:02.976
Phone as soon as you get to host family
in Fort Worth.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.312
Remember to give him the pineapple.

08:10.189 --> 08:11.679
(Kahn) Practice on bus!

08:27.173 --> 08:28.140
Aw!

08:28.341 --> 08:31.208
Mr. Hill?
My dad said I could go to Branson.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.937
How fast do you think you can get...

08:33.044 --> 08:35.707
The Dale Gribble Bluegrass Experience
back together?

08:35.948 --> 08:38.006
Probably after they finish their beers.

08:38.116 --> 08:41.712
Hey, guys, don't open a new one!
We're going to Branson!

08:41.821 --> 08:44.221
-We're going to Branson!
-Yeah, we're really going to go now!

08:51.297 --> 08:53.891
Come on, Dale.
You don't need two suitcases.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.365
They're my jumpsuits.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.459
That's what the people come to see.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.397
[birds chirping]

09:01.274 --> 09:05.210
Bobby, I can't baby-sit you and Bill.
And he's in the band.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.340
Bill, spit that out.

09:11.117 --> 09:14.575
I'm coming with you.
Yakov Smirnoff is in Branson...

09:14.687 --> 09:18.054
and he's a stepping stone
to my comedy-writing future.

09:18.190 --> 09:20.090
[sighing] All right.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.688
But you better sleep the whole way.

09:27.199 --> 09:28.166
[honking horn]

09:29.068 --> 09:31.229
-We'll be careful.
-What do I care?

09:50.256 --> 09:53.919
-Hi, Dad. Fort Worth is great.
-What's the competitioi like?

09:54.060 --> 09:56.051
-ls Tim Woo there?
-Yeah...

09:56.162 --> 09:59.689
but he hurt his hand
stealing a Coke from the Coke machine.

09:59.865 --> 10:00.832
[Kahi laughiig]

10:01.100 --> 10:03.364
Hey, Connie, is my tongue blue?

10:04.303 --> 10:06.635
-Who's that?
-It's Tim Woo.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.331
His tongue is blue.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.408
-Dad, I got to go practice some more.
-Yes, Go practice,

10:11.510 --> 10:14.638
-Okay, Dad. I love you.
-Stop talkiig, Go practice,

10:21.587 --> 10:25.523
The key to writing
a good Yakov Smirnoff joke...

10:25.625 --> 10:28.856
is picturing yourself arriving in America...

10:28.995 --> 10:32.590
and noticing
that it is different from Russia.

10:32.732 --> 10:37.465
Yeah. And when Yakov says
""l reckon"" and ""y'all"" in his accent...

10:37.570 --> 10:40.368
I just lose it. It's brilliant, really.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.636
The only thing ""brilliant, really,""
about Yakov Smirnoff...

10:43.743 --> 10:45.938
is that he's a KGB spy.

10:46.112 --> 10:49.013
He's been sending US secrets
back to mother Russia...

10:49.115 --> 10:52.744
while tourists are seduced
by his fake comedy act.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.852
Although his beard is real.

10:55.087 --> 10:56.054
[laughing]

10:56.222 --> 11:00.090
Oh, this joke will kill. You wanna hear it?

11:00.192 --> 11:03.889
No, not really. The band needs to practice
till we're perfect.

11:04.030 --> 11:07.329
I don't want to tarnish our reputation
before we have one.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.560
Okay, but first I want to hear the joke.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.795
Here goes.

11:10.903 --> 11:15.363
[fake Russian accent] In America, you put
""ln God We Trust"" on your money.

11:15.708 --> 11:19.041
In Russia, we have no money!

11:20.946 --> 11:21.913
[laughing]

11:22.948 --> 11:23.915
Oh!

11:24.316 --> 11:25.806
Come on, focus.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.516
Does anybody remember
why we're going to Branson?

11:29.655 --> 11:32.089
-Fiddle contest!
-And to have fun!

11:32.224 --> 11:35.057
I mean, even in math camp
we played chess.

11:35.327 --> 11:39.354
Yes, yes, we're going to have fun.
But you know what's not fun?

11:39.498 --> 11:41.398
Being ill-prepared.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.395
Okay. One, two, three, four.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.917
All right, everybody.
Cough up $2 and we'll be officially entered.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.485
No turning back now.

12:00.586 --> 12:01.883
Hey, it's 4:50.

12:01.987 --> 12:05.479
You think it's too late
to get seats for the 5:00 Yakov?

12:05.725 --> 12:06.885
[all cheering]

12:07.660 --> 12:10.823
Well, maybe you can get Yakov
to write you an autograph.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.228
""Dear Dale, hope the show was worth...

12:13.332 --> 12:16.460
""throwing away
that young girl's musical career.

12:17.002 --> 12:19.129
""Yours truly, Yakov.""

12:19.238 --> 12:21.729
Can do, will do. Come on, Connie.

12:22.274 --> 12:25.903
Okay, Connie, just tell them
you're not interested so they'll drop it.

12:26.011 --> 12:28.411
-Well....
-See? She's not interested.

12:31.817 --> 12:32.784
Where do we put the gift?

12:32.885 --> 12:35.479
Mess up her bed
and hide it underneath her pillow.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.920
And when she come home from audition,
we'll scream at her...

12:38.023 --> 12:40.116
""Kahn Jr.! Clean up your filthy room! ""

12:40.226 --> 12:44.356
And when she cleans it up,
that's when she finds the Limoges violin.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.433
""Bill Monroe""?
""The Foggy Mountain Boys""?

12:49.535 --> 12:53.938
-Minh, have you seen this pornography?
-Don't worry. She's in Fort Worth.

12:54.106 --> 12:57.371
-We throw it out before she gets back.
-Wait a minute.

12:57.476 --> 13:00.570
Tim Woo hates Coca-Cola!

13:03.883 --> 13:05.145
[screaming]

13:05.651 --> 13:07.278
Connie's in Branson!

13:09.255 --> 13:11.621
I've been learning English for 20 years.

13:11.724 --> 13:15.160
Now, I move to the Ozarks,
I have to start all over again.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.388
Mel Tillis is teaching me English.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.930
It's taking a lot longer than I expected.

13:24.770 --> 13:29.230
Yakov Smirnoff is not my real name.
It used to be Jack Daniels.

13:29.675 --> 13:30.937
[laughing]

13:32.044 --> 13:36.606
Mr. Smirnoff, I would one day
like to be a comedian like yourself.

13:37.883 --> 13:41.444
I've written an ""in America and in Russia""
joke for you...

13:41.554 --> 13:43.886
that I think is very funny.

13:43.989 --> 13:47.152
Hey, kid, I don't tell Russian jokes
for last 10 years.

13:47.259 --> 13:50.751
Now, I do jokes
about relationships and things I observe.

13:53.599 --> 13:54.793
[laughing]

13:55.301 --> 13:58.202
I'll give you $20 American.
Keep them coming.

13:59.638 --> 14:00.605
[exclaims]

14:00.739 --> 14:01.706
[screaming]

14:02.241 --> 14:03.833
Why did you do that?

14:03.943 --> 14:07.106
Save the sweet-guy act
for the tourists, Nikolai.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.380
The ClA will be here momentarily.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.143
I called them during
the Statue of Liberty dance number.

14:12.251 --> 14:13.479
Are you okay?

14:13.586 --> 14:17.249
-My left eye really burns.
-He's faking it, Bobby.

14:17.656 --> 14:20.853
It's all part of his act,
which, by the way, is very funny.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.086
(man) There he is.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.219
(womai) Security, we have a situatioi
ii the lobby,

14:27.733 --> 14:28.927
[people chattering]

14:29.034 --> 14:31.628
(Bill) Yakov was so funny.

14:31.737 --> 14:35.366
He should be the center square.
I'm so sick of Whoopi.

14:35.474 --> 14:39.069
Oh, and we got to meet him
after the show. Great guy.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.038
Where have you guys been?

14:41.146 --> 14:44.547
I've had to deal
with the Bluegrass Brothers all by myself.

14:44.650 --> 14:48.552
They've been staring at me, twiddling
their beards and trying to psych me out.

14:48.654 --> 14:53.353
Dad, I sold my joke to Yakov!
I'm a professional comedy writer!

14:53.492 --> 14:56.655
Look, I told you to stay out of my wallet.

14:58.664 --> 15:01.224
-The Dale Gribble Bluegrass Experience?
-Yo, man.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.198
Y'on after the Harris Twins.

15:03.302 --> 15:07.329
One holds the fiddle while the other
holds the bow. They're good.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.340
Oh, God. Well, this is it, Connie.

15:10.542 --> 15:14.205
Your dream to become
a professional bluegrass musician.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.678
-Don't blow it.
-My dream?

15:16.849 --> 15:18.942
-Mr. Hill--
-Come on, Connie, focus.

15:19.051 --> 15:22.851
-Rosin up your bow and focus.
-No! No more rosin.

15:23.055 --> 15:26.115
No more of your
""see the fiddle, be the fiddle"" rhetoric.

15:26.225 --> 15:29.956
I don't want to be
a professional bluegrass musician. I quit.

15:30.362 --> 15:34.162
And I quit, too,
even though I'm not in the band!

15:34.433 --> 15:36.424
What? Where are you going?

15:36.535 --> 15:39.003
The twins are finishing. Connie!

15:40.039 --> 15:42.303
Well, I saw that coming.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.206
Yet I did nothing to stop it.

15:45.844 --> 15:47.641
Why do I fear success?

15:52.284 --> 15:53.273
[sighing]

15:53.385 --> 15:56.183
Maybe Connie ran off
'cause of stage fright.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.725
Okay. I'm not afraid to say it.
We're a novelty band without Connie.

16:00.926 --> 16:05.386
It's gonna be fine. You guys just
stall the audience until I get her back.

16:05.497 --> 16:07.692
Boomhauer, you're good at stage patter.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.961
Yeah. Maybe I'll give a little bit
of the old, ""Hey, man...

16:10.069 --> 16:12.503
""how're you doing in Branson, man?
Let me hear you say, 'yeah!'""

16:12.604 --> 16:14.071
Good. Perfect. Do that.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.207
(man) All right, guys.

16:21.914 --> 16:22.881
[exclaims]

16:23.115 --> 16:25.948
You kidnapped my daughter
and took her across state lines...

16:26.051 --> 16:28.144
to play hillbilly music against her will.

16:28.253 --> 16:32.053
I've been looking for a reason
to put you in jail and now I have it!

16:32.157 --> 16:34.955
What are you talking about?
You gave her permission to come with us.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.961
Never! I make sure she practice Mozart...

16:38.063 --> 16:40.588
get into Van Cliburn,
then lvy League orchestra.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.690
From there, she play Paris, Rome...

16:42.801 --> 16:45.531
then I take her back
to my hometown of Louangphrabang...

16:45.637 --> 16:47.537
and stick it up their nose!

16:47.639 --> 16:49.664
-That's why she ran away from you.
-Oh?

16:49.808 --> 16:52.902
She'd rather play bluegrass
and win this contest...

16:53.012 --> 16:55.810
and then get a record deal and open up...

16:56.048 --> 16:58.744
the Connie Souphanousinphone Theater
and....

16:58.851 --> 16:59.840
[sighing]

16:59.952 --> 17:01.214
I'm a jackass.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.414
Stop stating the obvious!
Where is my daughter?

17:05.424 --> 17:06.617
I don't know.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.782
I'm sure she's fine. She's with Bobby.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.954
Great! That narrows it down.

17:12.097 --> 17:15.294
Now all we have to do
is check every free buffet in town.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.935
How about this one?
I've been working out with weights.

17:21.173 --> 17:25.872
Every time someone says,
""Let's work out,"" I say, ""Wait.""

17:26.211 --> 17:28.975
That's funny, Bobby. Oh, I'm sorry.

17:29.148 --> 17:32.743
It's just I'm sick of our dads
putting pressure on me.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.482
At least they're paying attention.

17:35.587 --> 17:38.215
It feels like I'm always playing
to an empty house.

17:38.323 --> 17:39.984
You know what I'd love to do?

17:40.092 --> 17:43.858
Run away to the Appalachian Mountains
and play bluegrass all day long...

17:43.962 --> 17:46.692
with people who know
that music is about having fun.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.825
People who sing and smile
even though they're poor...

17:49.935 --> 17:52.130
and their faces are smudged with coal.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.502
And I can wear overalls
with no shirt and tell jokes...

17:55.607 --> 17:58.633
about the high cost of mules! Let's do it!

18:00.212 --> 18:03.443
The Dale Gribble Bluegrass Experience?
You're up.

18:03.549 --> 18:07.041
They're not here, they're locked in a vault.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.248
-What?
-Hold on!

18:09.621 --> 18:12.715
Screw Connie.
I got us an even better fiddle player.

18:12.825 --> 18:16.522
May I present to you Mr. Charlie Daniels?

18:18.430 --> 18:21.922
Where's this young fiddle player
whose final wish was to meet me?

18:22.034 --> 18:26.027
Well, actually, you're too late,
but her other final wish was that...

18:26.138 --> 18:30.199
you would play with us her favorite song
on that stage now.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.039
So, what do I tell her parents?

18:34.046 --> 18:36.344
Tell them I'll play
till my fiddle catches fire.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.216
[whooping]

18:38.684 --> 18:39.810
[audience applauding]

18:42.287 --> 18:44.278
(womai) The bus for Hollister
will be departiig ii 20 miiutes,

18:44.389 --> 18:48.189
Oh! We can't afford bus tickets.
We only have enough money for a T-shirt...

18:48.293 --> 18:51.160
or a row of seats
at the Andy Williams show.

18:51.396 --> 18:54.456
Well, I could go for either,
but it's up to you.

18:56.435 --> 18:57.402
[exclaims]

18:58.337 --> 19:02.068
Bobby, we are gonna
be in Appalachia by sundown.

19:04.676 --> 19:08.009
Why do we do it, Kahn?
Why do we push Connie so hard?

19:08.180 --> 19:12.310
I do it because she has a lot of talent
and I want what's best for her.

19:12.417 --> 19:13.714
You do it....

19:13.819 --> 19:17.050
Well, frankly, I'm flummoxed.
Back off. Push Bobby.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.145
[snorts]

19:18.257 --> 19:20.725
He doesn't like sports.
He doesn't play an instrument.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.885
-There's nothing to push him into.
-Yeah.

19:22.995 --> 19:27.091
-He gonna be a loser, all right.
-Now, hold on. Bobby's not a loser.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.461
Say that again
and I'll pop you in the chops.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.229
Okay, okay.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.533
One hillbilly starts swinging,
soon the whole town join in.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.803
For your information,
a lot of people think Bobby's funny.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.373
The kid's only 13 years old
and he's already sold a joke...

19:41.480 --> 19:43.846
to this Yakov Smirnoff.

19:44.049 --> 19:45.482
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

19:46.585 --> 19:50.077
""ln America, they put 'ln God We Trust'
on the money.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.214
""ln Russia, they have no money.""

19:53.425 --> 19:55.359
[laughing] That's funny. I hate Russia.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.858
Yeah. Yeah, that is a good joke.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.055
It's Branson-good.

20:02.434 --> 20:03.526
[singing]

20:06.972 --> 20:10.999
Oh, damn you, Hank Hill!
I can't get that song out of my head.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.167
Here it goes again.

20:14.346 --> 20:15.574
[singing]

20:17.482 --> 20:18.449
[violin playing]

20:26.692 --> 20:27.659
[Kahn yells]

20:27.993 --> 20:30.223
She's playing on the streets
for lousy tourists!

20:30.329 --> 20:32.058
She should be playing
at Royal Albert Hall...

20:32.164 --> 20:34.530
for Prince Charles
and Camilla Parker-Bowles.

20:34.633 --> 20:35.964
Oh, come on, Kahn.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.834
I bet you never knew
she could smile and play at the same time.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.175
[singing]

21:02.194 --> 21:04.094
Maybe one day,
you can be our opening act.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.125
[siigiig]

21:22.948 --> 21:23.915
[laughs]

21:28.020 --> 21:29.351
[all cheering]

21:30.522 --> 21:33.582
Connie Souphanousinphone, everyone!

21:33.859 --> 21:35.850
She's only 13!

21:38.096 --> 21:39.393
That's him.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.002
[Dale screaming]

21:44.202 --> 21:46.067
Use force if you need to.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.237
Help, Charlie! Help, somebody!

22:29.381 --> 22:30.609
(Haik) I like it,

22:31.305 --> 22:37.588
