WEBVTT

00:09.496 --> 00:11.066
Bones, you okay?

00:11.574 --> 00:13.354
Can I... can I
make you something?

00:15.348 --> 00:17.443
You bought cream soda?
My dad was the only one

00:17.491 --> 00:19.607
who drank it...
We don't need it anymore.

00:19.679 --> 00:23.289
I heard back from the cemetery.
11:00 on Friday will work.

00:23.378 --> 00:25.308
They said that they'll do their best

00:25.356 --> 00:27.386
to clean my mother's
headstone before then.

00:27.434 --> 00:29.529
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

00:29.638 --> 00:31.154
For not noticing that my father was

00:31.202 --> 00:32.464
the only one in this house

00:32.512 --> 00:35.084
who ever drank cream soda?

00:35.557 --> 00:37.527
Look, you're not alone here.

00:37.786 --> 00:40.177
Remember that.
I love you.

00:40.247 --> 00:42.347
Just tell me what you need.

00:49.802 --> 00:52.383
It's your phone.
It doesn't matter.

00:59.943 --> 01:03.082
There's a body
washed up on the beach

01:03.130 --> 01:05.459
in Newfoundland, Canada.

01:05.558 --> 01:09.212
A United States passport was
found in the travel belt.

01:12.584 --> 01:15.716
Max used to buy this soda
for the kids.

01:15.764 --> 01:18.154
He would mix it up
with a little heavy cream,

01:18.224 --> 01:21.075
and he would call it
a "Grandpa Milkshake."

01:21.404 --> 01:24.115
I just thought it'd be
nice to have around.

01:24.185 --> 01:27.334
The remains were brought to
the Jeffersonian to confirm ID.

01:28.526 --> 01:31.286
- You want me to drive you?
- No.

01:31.334 --> 01:34.704
I'm perfectly capable
of driving myself.

01:41.986 --> 01:44.310
Remodeling of the right
clavicle and ulna

01:44.358 --> 01:48.685
are a match for the childhood
injuries, so ID is positive.

01:48.771 --> 01:50.704
"Sarah Abbott, 22.

01:50.752 --> 01:52.880
Winston-Salem,
North Carolina."

01:52.928 --> 01:54.670
Wonder what she was doing
in Newfoundland.

01:54.718 --> 01:57.170
She was dressed like
she was out for a hike.

01:57.248 --> 01:59.162
There's a chest wound.

01:59.342 --> 02:00.670
It's a through and through.

02:00.718 --> 02:02.170
Gunshot?

02:02.951 --> 02:06.076
There's structural damage
and staining throughout.

02:06.124 --> 02:07.484
Looks like this is
what killed her.

02:07.532 --> 02:09.862
Check it out. Good old dung.

02:09.910 --> 02:12.170
Not even the ocean
can make wash that off.

02:12.238 --> 02:14.287
I'm finding multiple fractures.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.084
Exact cause and time
are indeterminate.

02:17.132 --> 02:20.662
Degree of decomp and adipocere
formation suggests

02:20.726 --> 02:22.193
she hasn't been dead that long.

02:22.241 --> 02:24.638
Maybe three days in the water,
one on the beach?

02:24.694 --> 02:27.599
Hey, guys, um,
just a heads-up,

02:27.647 --> 02:29.576
Brennan is on her way in.

02:29.787 --> 02:31.130
She is?

02:31.193 --> 02:33.310
Well, Booth must've told her
about the case,

02:33.413 --> 02:34.943
'cause I didn't contact her.

02:34.991 --> 02:36.826
Well, for whatever reason,

02:36.874 --> 02:39.912
the lab is where
she wants to be right now.

02:44.406 --> 02:46.076
Is that some sort
of a picture?

02:46.104 --> 02:47.607
It was in the victim's
travel belt.

02:47.655 --> 02:49.998
I sent the original to Angela.
We'll see what she can do.

02:50.115 --> 02:51.287
Anything else on the victim?

02:51.328 --> 02:53.028
Just a passport, house key.

02:53.063 --> 02:55.606
We really don't know much.
Recent graduate at UNC.

02:55.654 --> 02:57.793
Older sister said
she's been traveling a lot.

02:57.841 --> 02:59.630
- Hmm.
- She coming in?

02:59.685 --> 03:02.024
Yeah, she's... she's on her way.
Right.

03:02.072 --> 03:04.912
So... how's Brennan?

03:04.942 --> 03:07.098
Well, she's, you know,
given her history and all,

03:07.146 --> 03:08.577
she's a lot tougher than she should be.

03:08.612 --> 03:11.474
Um, let me know when
the older sister gets here.

03:11.529 --> 03:13.201
- Booth?
- Yeah?

03:13.334 --> 03:15.724
There was nothing that
you could've done.

03:16.623 --> 03:19.005
Yeah, maybe not in the moment,

03:19.099 --> 03:21.576
but there's a lot that I could've done.

03:30.216 --> 03:31.818
Hi.

03:31.896 --> 03:34.572
Cam said you had something for me?

03:34.755 --> 03:36.335
Oh...

03:39.443 --> 03:41.059
How are you?

03:41.536 --> 03:43.231
Everyone keeps
asking me that.

03:43.326 --> 03:45.802
I don't know how
to answer that question.

03:45.974 --> 03:48.552
Okay. Then how are the kids?

03:48.724 --> 03:53.349
They're adjusting, but we've
had a few days all together,

03:53.397 --> 03:57.162
and I think they're relieved
to get back to routine.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.650
Yeah.

03:59.849 --> 04:01.832
Was this found with the victim?

04:01.880 --> 04:04.825
Yeah. I've been trying
to reverse-engineer

04:04.873 --> 04:08.568
the water damage
to figure out what it is.

04:10.427 --> 04:12.373
Looks like a painting.

04:12.509 --> 04:15.123
I actually think it's
a photograph of a painting

04:15.248 --> 04:19.012
printed on regular
printer paper.

04:19.442 --> 04:22.119
All the blue, maybe a seascape.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.740
Temperance.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.194
Sully?

04:28.295 --> 04:29.779
Whoa.

04:31.466 --> 04:32.728
Oh...

04:32.763 --> 04:33.951
Uh...

04:37.576 --> 04:40.763
Uh, we'll just
give you two a minute.

04:40.898 --> 04:42.368
Bye. Bye.

04:48.712 --> 04:50.382
Where did he come from?

04:50.414 --> 04:52.184
I have no idea.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.240
Security just said
that we had a visitor.

04:54.326 --> 04:57.638
Hey, who's the dude that's
hooking up with Dr. Brennan?

04:58.052 --> 05:00.064
Tim Sullivan.
"Sully."

05:00.112 --> 05:01.320
And he is?

05:01.451 --> 05:03.028
The only guy besides Booth

05:03.130 --> 05:05.670
who ever stood a chance.

05:48.779 --> 05:50.162
Probably not too smart, though.

05:50.233 --> 05:51.600
Of course they're smart.
I'm kidding.

05:51.647 --> 05:53.874
Oh, I know.

05:56.006 --> 05:57.308
Why are you here?

05:57.358 --> 06:01.777
Not just on the East Coast,
I mean... here.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.678
I found out what happened
with your dad,

06:03.720 --> 06:05.873
and I wanted to check on you.

06:07.787 --> 06:09.505
You've aged.

Uh, yes. Thank you?

What about the woman?

06:14.619 --> 06:17.075
Um, the one who plays the clarinet?

06:17.123 --> 06:18.033
Oboe.

06:18.054 --> 06:23.124
- Oboe.
- Oboe.Yeah. She is <i> young,</i>

06:23.381 --> 06:27.998
uh, so I'm not sure
there's a future there.

06:28.279 --> 06:30.283
Well, statistically
speaking, if she's young,

06:30.313 --> 06:32.053
there's more of a chance
of a future with her

06:32.081 --> 06:34.381
than with someone your own age.

06:36.717 --> 06:38.218
It is good to see you, Tempe.

06:38.254 --> 06:40.854
You, too.

06:43.842 --> 06:46.233
There's beveling on the left scapula,

06:46.262 --> 06:51.502
as well as damage on the third
and fourth left vertebral ribs.

06:51.534 --> 06:54.342
- All consistent with a gunshot.
- Mm-hmm.

06:54.390 --> 06:57.303
Though soft tissue suggests
it was low velocity.

06:57.389 --> 06:58.910
Agreed.

06:58.941 --> 07:00.396
Let's talk about this Sully character.

07:00.443 --> 07:02.880
Exactly how long were he
and Dr. Brennan together?

07:02.912 --> 07:05.420
- Not very long.
- Hmm.

07:05.514 --> 07:06.751
I'm surprised, Dr. Edison.

07:06.834 --> 07:09.253
I didn't take you for
a workplace gossip type of guy.

07:09.373 --> 07:11.255
I'm not, I'm just concerned.

07:11.381 --> 07:13.247
Dr. Brennan is in a
vulnerable place right now,

07:13.342 --> 07:15.270
and I think the timing of this visit

07:15.318 --> 07:16.622
seems awfully convenient.

07:16.670 --> 07:17.724
You talking about Sully?

07:17.772 --> 07:19.690
Oh, he is not a predator, trust me.

07:19.729 --> 07:21.358
He's one of the nicest guys around.

07:21.428 --> 07:23.358
- Are you here to swab something?
- Oh, yeah.

07:23.406 --> 07:25.287
So it turns out that
the only thing I could find

07:25.335 --> 07:27.928
in the external chest wound,
besides sea water,

07:27.995 --> 07:30.225
were trace amounts of
<i>Parafavella gigantea</i>

07:30.273 --> 07:31.756
and <i> Helicostomella</i> Algae.

07:31.858 --> 07:34.132
- Nothing to link us to the weapon?
- Oh, I'm not giving up.

07:34.179 --> 07:36.740
- May I?
- Be my guest.

07:37.233 --> 07:41.061
Dr. Edison, will you look at this?

07:41.326 --> 07:44.279
There's something embedded
in the adipocere.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.505
Yes, what is that?

07:54.068 --> 07:56.084
Looks like a bone.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.372
A fragment or something vestigial?

07:58.553 --> 07:59.701
I'm not sure.

07:59.749 --> 08:01.075
Uh, hey, Cam,

08:01.103 --> 08:02.187
there's a piece of string adhered

08:02.234 --> 08:04.006
to the tissue there, you see that?

08:04.106 --> 08:06.336
Maybe that's something that
the victim was wearing.

08:13.264 --> 08:15.479
Let me get this straight,
you make sandwiches?

08:15.647 --> 08:17.718
Yeah, and I even
named one after you.

08:17.850 --> 08:21.436
Triple-decker with roast beef,
pastrami, Swiss cheese.

08:21.484 --> 08:23.084
- All right. Is that on rye?
- Oh, yeah.

08:23.152 --> 08:24.520
- I approve.
- What about me?

08:24.568 --> 08:25.890
I want a sandwich.

08:25.928 --> 08:27.810
You have one, the Tempe Tempeh.

08:27.858 --> 08:30.850
Excuse me, folks. Victim's sister's here.

08:30.983 --> 08:32.630
How you doing?
Special Agent James Aubrey,

08:32.678 --> 08:33.989
work with Booth and Brennan.

08:34.037 --> 08:35.773
Tim Sullivan, former Special Agent,

08:35.804 --> 08:37.745
now Professional Sandwich Maker.

08:37.773 --> 08:39.743
- Oh. You may be my new idol.
- Listen, Sully,

08:39.775 --> 08:41.240
we got to get back to the case, so...

08:41.287 --> 08:43.010
Oh, no, of course.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.795
Hey, how about dinner tomorrow, on me?

08:46.225 --> 08:47.452
That would be nice.

08:47.483 --> 08:50.883
Okay. I'll see you then.

09:00.196 --> 09:03.012
Our parents died in a
car crash 14 years ago.

09:03.152 --> 09:06.238
That's when your sister
suffered those breaks?

09:06.308 --> 09:07.973
We were both in the car.

09:08.051 --> 09:09.597
I was 18. I grew up fast.

09:09.639 --> 09:13.469
But Sarah, she was only eight.

09:13.746 --> 09:15.637
She went to go live
with our grandmother.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.948
Your mom's mom, right? Stella Lewis?

09:17.996 --> 09:19.551
She passed away, what,
four months ago?

09:19.652 --> 09:22.982
Yes. Sarah and Grandma Stella
were super close.

09:23.183 --> 09:24.574
She took it hard.

09:24.644 --> 09:26.137
It's understandable.

09:26.262 --> 09:28.365
And she was sort of adrift.

09:28.793 --> 09:31.301
I thought traveling would help.

09:31.427 --> 09:34.187
- Why Newfoundland?
- I'm not sure.

09:34.652 --> 09:38.254
Maybe she just wanted to go
somewhere that was far away.

09:38.496 --> 09:40.175
Listen, we're...

09:40.902 --> 09:43.303
we're still working on the
water damage to this picture.

09:43.339 --> 09:45.169
Does that look familiar to you?

09:45.207 --> 09:47.237
Do you recognize that at all?

09:49.045 --> 09:52.344
I think this is a painting
my grandmother had.

09:52.649 --> 09:54.851
Any idea why Sarah would've been

09:54.884 --> 09:56.938
carrying around a copy of it with her?

09:57.087 --> 10:00.696
No. I wish I did.

10:01.477 --> 10:05.430
I have a husband,
and a baby on the way.

10:05.782 --> 10:08.558
Why do I feel like I don't
have a family anymore?

10:15.683 --> 10:17.886
So these pictures,
this is all Newfoundland?

10:17.972 --> 10:19.267
It's similar, right?

10:19.308 --> 10:20.268
And look at this.

10:20.309 --> 10:22.065
This is the painting signature.

10:22.159 --> 10:24.355
"Stella Lewis."

10:24.468 --> 10:26.768
The victim's grandmother painted this.

10:26.816 --> 10:30.016
Yeah, And she called it <i>Secret Harbor.</i>

10:30.089 --> 10:32.422
What's so secret?
I don't know.

10:32.455 --> 10:35.105
- Maybe she went there to find out.
- Hmm.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.621
So speaking of secrets,
I just met Tim Sullivan.

10:37.660 --> 10:38.890
Now, am I imagining things,

10:38.928 --> 10:41.292
or is there some kind
of history there?

10:43.499 --> 10:47.401
♪♪

10:50.892 --> 10:53.132
Tell me everything.

10:54.401 --> 10:55.737
That was Clark.

10:55.839 --> 10:57.659
So the fragment
found with the victim

10:57.707 --> 11:00.034
is... a piece of animal bone.

11:00.144 --> 11:01.385
Apparently she was wearing it.

11:01.417 --> 11:03.167
- What do you mean, like a necklace?
- Precisely.

11:03.214 --> 11:06.409
Its apparent age suggests
it was some sort of relic.

11:06.526 --> 11:10.225
Clark is checking with
the human artifacts division,

11:10.408 --> 11:12.838
see if they can figure out
where it came from.

11:14.394 --> 11:17.058
Have you heard back
from the State Department yet?

11:17.183 --> 11:18.885
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police

11:18.933 --> 11:22.519
have agreed to full FBI involvement.

That's great!

11:23.792 --> 11:25.714
When... When do you leave?

11:25.925 --> 11:27.337
I'm not going.

11:29.464 --> 11:31.394
But you're the lead on the case.

11:31.472 --> 11:34.222
You're about to bury your dad.
I want to be here for you.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.714
Booth, you asked
what you could do,

11:38.796 --> 11:40.936
how you could help.

11:44.128 --> 11:45.886
I think it would be good for me

11:45.934 --> 11:48.972
to be alone for a few days.

21:56.556 --> 21:58.956
Such a brutal way
to kill someone.

22:00.092 --> 22:01.529
There.

22:01.561 --> 22:04.261
A broadhead... that
explains the carbon fiber

22:04.297 --> 22:06.397
Dr. Hodgins found.
That's used

22:06.432 --> 22:08.192
for the stems.
It could also

22:08.234 --> 22:09.564
explain the venison jerky;

22:09.602 --> 22:10.802
if the killer was eating some

22:10.850 --> 22:12.121
right before loading an arrow...

22:12.163 --> 22:14.072
The particulates would
have transferred.

22:14.107 --> 22:15.307
You should tell Booth.

22:15.341 --> 22:18.217
Oh, aren't you...
You want me...

22:18.340 --> 22:21.169
Yes, I will call him right now.

22:26.959 --> 22:29.272
Dude, you're beeping.

22:30.038 --> 22:31.082
Yeah, that's your fault.

22:31.124 --> 22:32.884
'Cause that's the results
that you wanted

22:32.925 --> 22:34.495
from the fractures.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.303
Let's take a look here.

22:38.794 --> 22:41.022
These look like the injuries
were all made by rocks,

22:41.082 --> 22:42.452
coastal ones.

22:42.602 --> 22:44.311
She must have fallen.

22:44.505 --> 22:46.717
Probably from quite a height.

22:47.225 --> 22:50.205
So, say she was standing
on a cliff or a bluff,

22:50.253 --> 22:52.350
- or, you know, somewhere above the ocean.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:52.397 --> 22:54.767
She gets shot. Yeah, falls
forward, off of the edge.

22:54.847 --> 22:56.017
Flips in midair,

22:56.049 --> 22:58.149
and falls flat on her back.

22:58.184 --> 22:59.514
Right on the rocks.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.412
Tide came up, washed her to sea.

23:01.454 --> 23:02.684
Okay, great.

23:02.722 --> 23:05.082
So all we have to do
is locate a cliff

23:05.124 --> 23:07.324
that's a correct distance
above a rocky coastline

23:07.360 --> 23:09.200
to account for the
severity of the fractures,

23:09.228 --> 23:10.598
and we've got ourselves
our murder site.

23:10.630 --> 23:12.700
Like right there!

23:12.726 --> 23:15.086
Or there. Or...

23:15.134 --> 23:16.464
there.

23:16.502 --> 23:17.862
Yeah, maybe we
should just go back

23:17.904 --> 23:19.364
to searching for Vikings.

23:19.405 --> 23:20.805
Might be easier.

23:24.310 --> 23:25.880
Hey.

23:25.912 --> 23:28.272
Rick's Sporting Goods
and Hunting Adventures.

23:28.314 --> 23:30.114
Gilda says that's where
everyone in the area

23:30.149 --> 23:31.489
gets their hunting supplies.

23:31.517 --> 23:32.887
You coming?

23:32.919 --> 23:34.889
Why don't you take this
one, all right? I'm, uh,

23:34.921 --> 23:37.451
I'm gonna dig a little deeper
on this Adam Hitchcock guy.

23:37.490 --> 23:40.230
I got a gut feeling about him.

23:40.259 --> 23:41.499
Uh, look,

23:41.527 --> 23:43.067
it's none of my business...

23:43.096 --> 23:45.196
Correct... but I'm just
gonna keep talking anyway.

23:45.231 --> 23:47.991
I don't know anything,
really, but...

23:48.034 --> 23:51.064
whatever's going on right now,

23:51.104 --> 23:52.904
I'm sure you guys will
get through it.

23:53.940 --> 23:55.380
Well, just let me know

23:55.408 --> 23:57.808
what you find
from the arrowheads there, okay?

23:57.844 --> 23:59.374
Yeah.

23:59.583 --> 24:00.783
Thanks, Aubrey.

24:13.126 --> 24:14.326
Hey,

24:14.360 --> 24:16.200
what did you have to show me?

24:16.229 --> 24:18.099
So, I've been finding out
more about

24:18.131 --> 24:19.891
Grandma Stella's painting,

24:19.932 --> 24:21.262
which means I've been
finding out more

24:21.300 --> 24:22.840
about Grandma Stella

24:22.869 --> 24:24.339
herself.

24:24.370 --> 24:26.270
Stella Anders and Philip Lewis.

24:26.305 --> 24:29.575
So, Philip was in the army, but

24:29.609 --> 24:31.179
before they were married,
he was stationed

24:31.210 --> 24:33.381
at a U.S. run
military base...

24:33.429 --> 24:34.672
in Newfoundland.

24:34.714 --> 24:36.374
And who are these people?

24:36.415 --> 24:38.749
That's a family that
lived near the base,

24:38.831 --> 24:40.031
the Andreassens.

24:40.153 --> 24:42.553
The oldest daughter, Estelle,

24:42.601 --> 24:46.188
was the same age as
the victim's grandmother.

24:46.225 --> 24:50.095
So, you think Estelle Andreassen

24:50.129 --> 24:52.399
and Stella Anders
are the same person?

24:52.604 --> 24:55.691
The victim wasn't
looking for Vikings,

24:55.735 --> 24:59.235
she was looking for
her grandmother's history.

24:59.388 --> 25:01.018
Her home.

25:02.942 --> 25:05.242
Kathleen here is the
daughter of owner Rick;

25:05.278 --> 25:06.618
she's been hunting
since she was ten.

25:06.646 --> 25:08.746
Six.

25:09.749 --> 25:12.149
Oh, we should get some of this.

25:12.185 --> 25:13.455
For evidence?

25:14.564 --> 25:16.002
For snacks.

25:18.090 --> 25:19.590
Here's what I think
you're looking for.

25:19.625 --> 25:21.424
Cutting diameter one to
one-eighth of an inch,

25:21.471 --> 25:22.368
multi-blade.

25:22.416 --> 25:24.628
Bow used probably draws between 60

25:24.664 --> 25:26.264
and 65 pounds, does draw lengths

25:26.299 --> 25:28.239
between 28 and 29 inches.
Okay.

25:28.267 --> 25:29.267
Do you keep a record
of who buys these?

25:29.302 --> 25:30.262
Not at all.

25:30.303 --> 25:31.733
And we sell a ton.

25:31.771 --> 25:33.331
Anyone who goes bow hunting
out here for big game

25:33.372 --> 25:34.972
is gonna want
something like this.

25:35.007 --> 25:37.447
I hear someone
interested in hunting?

25:37.476 --> 25:39.606
Yeah, well,
in a manner of speaking.

25:39.645 --> 25:42.015
Ah. Rick Tobine.
This here's my store.

25:42.048 --> 25:43.848
I've been a hunting guide
on the island for over 40 years.

25:43.883 --> 25:45.113
Where you visiting from?

25:45.151 --> 25:47.911
D.C.... FBI Special Agent
James Aubrey.

25:47.954 --> 25:49.584
We're here about a murder, Rick.

25:49.622 --> 25:50.922
A young woman.

25:50.957 --> 25:53.027
You recognize her?

25:53.059 --> 25:55.699
No. No, sorry about that.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.128
What about Adam Hitchcock?

25:57.163 --> 25:58.793
That name ring a bell?

25:58.831 --> 26:00.331
Yeah, rich guy.

26:00.366 --> 26:01.966
I took him out, oh,

26:02.001 --> 26:03.931
about a week and a half ago.

26:03.970 --> 26:05.710
Does he use a gun or a bow?

26:05.738 --> 26:06.778
Bow.

26:06.806 --> 26:08.176
A real pain in my ass.

26:08.207 --> 26:09.437
Got him a black bear,

26:09.475 --> 26:10.775
a good sized one, too, but, uh,

26:10.810 --> 26:12.450
he said he wanted a caribou,

26:12.478 --> 26:14.818
complained he's got a
bear head back at home.

26:14.847 --> 26:16.717
Now, that...

26:16.749 --> 26:17.819
I've seen.

26:17.850 --> 26:18.820
The painting?

26:18.851 --> 26:21.151
No, not the painting,

26:21.187 --> 26:22.457
the harbor.

26:22.488 --> 26:24.358
Yeah.

26:24.390 --> 26:26.697
I think I've seen that on
the Andreassen property.

26:26.862 --> 26:29.492
Yeah, family's got tons of land.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.738
<i>You think they were related?</i>

26:33.766 --> 26:36.166
Well, look, if the victim's
grandmother was an Andreassen,

26:36.202 --> 26:37.702
then that means
the victim was, too.

26:37.737 --> 26:39.807
That family's got over 300 acres

26:39.839 --> 26:41.809
of pristine oceanfront property.

26:41.841 --> 26:43.201
Rumor is Adam Hitchcock
wants to buy it

26:43.242 --> 26:45.455
for upwards of $24 million.

26:45.635 --> 26:47.588
Well, that's an amount
that you might not want to share

26:47.635 --> 26:50.086
with a suddenly appearing
long-lost relative.

26:50.116 --> 26:51.646
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

26:51.684 --> 26:53.314
Look, I'm arriving now.

26:53.352 --> 26:55.852
We'll be there in five.

27:16.588 --> 27:18.776
Hey, excuse me,

27:18.824 --> 27:20.158
you live here?

27:22.493 --> 27:24.392
Whoa!

27:27.434 --> 27:28.645
Hands.

27:30.434 --> 27:31.704
Easy.

27:34.102 --> 27:36.463
Come on. Come on up,
arrow boy, let's go.

27:37.496 --> 27:39.635
Up. That's it.

27:41.307 --> 27:43.564
You make it a habit of
shooting people who come on to your

27:43.611 --> 27:44.854
property, pal?

27:44.924 --> 27:47.549
If I was actually trying to shoot you,
I wouldn't have missed.

27:49.432 --> 27:51.057
I was just trying to scare you.

27:51.151 --> 27:52.377
Why?

27:52.463 --> 27:55.377
I thought you worked
for that Adam guy.

27:55.615 --> 27:57.715
Adam Hitchcock?
Yeah. He's been

27:57.763 --> 28:00.947
harassing my wife, trying
to get her to sell this place.

28:01.081 --> 28:02.588
These arrows are all fieldheads.

28:02.636 --> 28:04.440
They aren't used for hunting.

28:04.488 --> 28:06.127
Right, okay.

28:06.979 --> 28:08.679
We have reason to believe that

28:08.714 --> 28:10.916
this woman was on your property.

28:10.964 --> 28:12.885
You recognize her?

28:12.936 --> 28:15.112
Oh, my God.
What's going on?

28:15.174 --> 28:17.942
- Doug...
- Ms. Andreassen, I'm Officer Sandling.

28:17.990 --> 28:18.979
It's okay, honey.

28:19.010 --> 28:20.596
There's been a mistake.

28:20.729 --> 28:21.947
Wait, that's Sarah.

28:22.065 --> 28:23.283
Why do you have that?

28:23.339 --> 28:25.509
- You knew her?
- Knew?

28:25.541 --> 28:28.033
Oh, my God,
did something happen to her?

28:31.987 --> 28:35.514
You found something that could
help locate the murder site?

28:35.551 --> 28:37.049
I think so.

28:37.143 --> 28:39.018
There was extensive damage
on the cortical surface

28:39.065 --> 28:41.830
due to postmortem
scavenging, but...

28:42.080 --> 28:45.598
look at what the scratches
reveal here

28:45.628 --> 28:47.628
and here.

28:50.366 --> 28:51.996
Staining.
There could be

28:52.034 --> 28:54.934
an underlying pattern

28:54.971 --> 28:56.783
of contusions.

28:56.879 --> 28:59.079
Hey. Clark, Hodgins said
you were looking for me?

28:59.127 --> 29:02.518
Yes. The victim has, uh,
perimortem bone bruising

29:02.582 --> 29:04.416
on the frontal
and right zygomatic.

29:04.527 --> 29:05.714
We just need your help to determine

29:05.761 --> 29:07.502
what might have
caused the injuries.

29:07.588 --> 29:09.315
Okay, um, well,
send me all the data

29:09.363 --> 29:11.363
and I'll see what I can do.

29:24.033 --> 29:25.153
I, uh...

29:26.435 --> 29:27.994
I need to get some air.

29:31.947 --> 29:34.143
So, is everything set
for your dad's service?

29:34.191 --> 29:35.237
Yes.

29:35.285 --> 29:36.354
It will be simple.

29:36.479 --> 29:38.039
Are you and Hodgins coming?

29:38.080 --> 29:39.280
Yeah, of course.

29:39.315 --> 29:40.885
Is your brother gonna be there?

29:40.916 --> 29:42.712
Russ can't make it.

29:42.939 --> 29:44.344
He and Amy and the girls

29:44.392 --> 29:47.447
are coming to visit us
this summer, and...

29:47.746 --> 29:50.376
we'll do something nice
for my dad then.

29:51.582 --> 29:54.952
Brennan, I really think
that you should talk to Booth.

29:55.275 --> 29:57.033
He's your husband.

29:57.158 --> 29:59.916
You can share
some of this with him.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.073
Maybe I don't want to.

30:03.233 --> 30:04.703
Maybe, when I try,

30:04.751 --> 30:07.728
I end up worrying about him.

30:07.915 --> 30:10.680
About whether he feels
responsible for what happened,

30:10.728 --> 30:14.625
and how I can... reassure him

30:14.673 --> 30:16.119
that he's not.

30:16.181 --> 30:19.447
That I-I don't
blame him.

30:19.908 --> 30:23.978
I just don't feel like
worrying about anyone right now.

30:25.228 --> 30:26.587
Is that wrong?

30:26.744 --> 30:28.089
No.

30:28.158 --> 30:30.923
I... I totally get it.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.595
I met her at the grocer's.

30:39.681 --> 30:41.461
She was putting up a copy
of this painting,

30:41.509 --> 30:43.892
asking for information.
I know that spot.

30:43.947 --> 30:45.506
I said it's on my property.

30:45.689 --> 30:47.848
- And you drove her out here yourself?
- Yes.

30:47.883 --> 30:50.673
She explained everything:
the painting, her grandmother.

30:50.853 --> 30:52.322
What about her grandmother?

30:52.416 --> 30:54.408
That she'd lived here as child.

30:54.533 --> 30:56.719
We figured out that my mother
and Sarah's grandmother

30:56.759 --> 30:58.959
must have been friends when
they were little. How so?

30:58.994 --> 31:01.534
They told us all the same
stories about this place.

31:01.564 --> 31:05.204
They used to find things...
Bits of metal, petrified nuts.

31:05.423 --> 31:07.931
My mother kept
a small tin full of stuff.

31:08.017 --> 31:10.066
And Sarah showed me something
her grandmother gave her.

31:10.105 --> 31:12.158
She had it around her neck.

31:12.322 --> 31:14.361
Techs aren't finding anything.

31:14.548 --> 31:17.012
Look, is there any chance
that Sarah might have been

31:17.046 --> 31:19.206
anywhere else
on the property by herself?

31:19.248 --> 31:21.148
Sure. I told her
she was welcome any time,

31:21.183 --> 31:23.023
even if Doug and I were at work.

31:23.052 --> 31:26.322
Ms. Andreassen, we'd have to do
genetic testing to be certain,

31:26.370 --> 31:28.986
but there's a chance
that your mother

31:29.034 --> 31:31.228
and Sarah's grandmother
were related.

31:31.350 --> 31:32.533
How?

31:33.305 --> 31:35.212
We think they were sisters.

31:39.423 --> 31:42.087
So that's what caused the bone
bruising on the victim's face.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.344
Yeah. It's called
a trail blaze.

31:44.373 --> 31:46.173
They're located all over the property.

31:46.330 --> 31:48.361
That way you can still follow the trails,

31:48.501 --> 31:50.043
even when there's snow on the ground.

31:50.079 --> 31:51.681
Are there any near the coastline?

31:51.798 --> 31:54.614
Uh, I'm scanning
the entire property now,

31:54.650 --> 31:57.000
using those satellite
photos that you gave me.

31:57.048 --> 31:58.889
Each time we find a spot
that has everything

31:58.921 --> 32:01.251
that we're looking for, we...
Like trail blaze,

32:01.290 --> 32:03.590
- sharp drop, rocky oceanfront.
- Right.

32:03.626 --> 32:07.533
I send the coordinates to Aubrey
and he sends a tech team there.

32:09.673 --> 32:13.478
Wait, they found Secret Harbor?

32:13.541 --> 32:16.572
Yeah, it looks
just like the painting, right?

32:16.673 --> 32:18.102
Aubrey sent it.

32:18.130 --> 32:19.798
The techs searched the area,

32:19.853 --> 32:21.125
but they didn't find anything.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.493
C-Could you pull up
the satellite view

32:22.524 --> 32:24.102
- of that spot for me, please?
- Yeah,

32:24.150 --> 32:25.452
let me just figure out what quadrant...

32:25.481 --> 32:26.767
Yeah, okay. Just-Just-Just,

32:26.822 --> 32:27.978
please, pull it up right here.

32:28.025 --> 32:29.900
Oh, okay. One sec.

32:29.985 --> 32:32.095
Okay, here.

32:33.689 --> 32:35.419
Leave it up on the screen.

32:35.457 --> 32:36.587
Hodgins!

32:36.802 --> 32:37.825
What?

32:37.860 --> 32:39.330
Hodgins!

32:39.361 --> 32:40.747
Yeah,

32:40.840 --> 32:42.910
there's some blood right here.

32:44.885 --> 32:46.185
All right, people.

32:46.233 --> 32:48.325
We're in the right spot so keep looking.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.840
If the victim was shot
and she fell back there,

32:49.872 --> 32:51.742
she didn't just topple
into the ocean.

32:51.774 --> 32:54.144
No, her killer must've
dragged her to the edge,

32:54.176 --> 32:56.136
pushed her off. SANDLING:
Techs found something,

32:56.178 --> 32:58.740
recently made ground holes.

32:58.872 --> 33:00.847
Could be the result
of a portable hunting blind.

33:00.883 --> 33:02.823
Plus, I found this.

33:02.871 --> 33:04.388
Well, that's thoughtful.
They left us

33:04.435 --> 33:05.974
some jerky
and some fingerprints.

33:06.022 --> 33:06.951
I'll run the prints.

33:07.005 --> 33:09.208
Looks like we found our killer, huh?

33:13.818 --> 33:16.130
Hey, come on, come on, come on.

33:16.185 --> 33:17.052
Come on.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.763
What? Clark, what?

33:18.811 --> 33:20.974
Look. Look.

33:21.191 --> 33:22.622
Wow...

33:22.670 --> 33:24.896
The growth pattern,
it's undeniable.

33:25.079 --> 33:26.935
What are you guys talking about?

33:27.053 --> 33:28.253
Wait, I heard yelling.

33:28.288 --> 33:30.058
Did we find something?

33:30.090 --> 33:31.590
Vikings, Cam.

33:31.857 --> 33:33.474
We found Vikings.

33:33.615 --> 33:35.068
Are they teeny, tiny Vikings?

33:35.116 --> 33:36.128
Uh, no, look,

33:36.176 --> 33:37.199
see how the grass growth here

33:37.233 --> 33:39.122
is darker, denser?

33:39.266 --> 33:41.231
It's because depressions
in the soil caused more

33:41.279 --> 33:42.297
moisture to collect there,

33:42.335 --> 33:43.865
providing an almost
perfect silhouette

33:43.919 --> 33:44.896
of a buried structure.

33:44.950 --> 33:46.630
There could be an
entire settlement here

33:46.685 --> 33:47.404
to excavate.

33:47.452 --> 33:49.779
I have to contact the
Jeffersonian Research Division.

33:49.943 --> 33:51.161
Excuse me.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.746
Aubrey says they got an ID.

34:00.302 --> 34:02.372
Kathleen Tobine.

34:03.638 --> 34:05.497
I'm afraid you need
to come with us.

34:05.607 --> 34:07.085
Hey!

34:07.325 --> 34:08.849
What the hell
you think you're doing?

34:08.927 --> 34:11.155
Mr. Tobine, your daughter
is under arrest.

34:11.197 --> 34:12.199
For what?

34:12.263 --> 34:13.502
Trespassing,

34:13.533 --> 34:16.029
attempted poaching and murder.

34:16.168 --> 34:17.364
Kathleen?

34:17.437 --> 34:20.367
I'm sorry, Dad, I'm sorry.

34:28.607 --> 34:30.677
So, Kathleen Tobine made

34:30.748 --> 34:31.978
a full confession.

34:32.344 --> 34:33.543
Said she was hunting illegally

34:33.578 --> 34:34.630
on private property

34:34.678 --> 34:36.543
and accidentally shot Sarah Abbott.

34:36.638 --> 34:38.068
- That's great.
- Yeah,

34:38.099 --> 34:39.139
only Booth doesn't believe her,

34:39.167 --> 34:40.279
says it doesn't feel right.

34:40.327 --> 34:41.693
I agree.

34:41.768 --> 34:43.565
- You do?
- Supposedly,

34:43.614 --> 34:45.489
the victim was killed here and then

34:45.560 --> 34:49.676
dragged to the edge of
the sea cliff and dropped,

34:49.710 --> 34:51.614
meaning she would've landed...

34:51.677 --> 34:54.449
Okay, let me get you a parabola.

34:54.833 --> 34:57.012
The victim landed
right about here.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.251
Exactly, but the injuries
are consistent

34:59.287 --> 35:02.246
with this area here that's rockier.

35:02.294 --> 35:03.496
So, how did

35:03.544 --> 35:05.137
the victim end up that far out?

35:05.185 --> 35:06.626
She wasn't pushed.

35:06.661 --> 35:10.863
She was held by her hands
and feet and swung out

35:10.911 --> 35:13.161
parallel to the ground.

35:13.201 --> 35:14.631
The victim was thrown.

35:14.669 --> 35:16.630
So, someone else was there.

35:21.427 --> 35:23.602
Two days ago,
Adam Hitchcock made an offer

35:23.644 --> 35:26.060
on your land for $3 million more

35:26.115 --> 35:27.137
than what it's worth.

35:27.185 --> 35:28.887
It was a payoff, wasn't it?

35:28.935 --> 35:30.716
You didn't kill Sarah Abbott.

35:30.832 --> 35:33.122
Adam Hitchcock did, right?

35:34.872 --> 35:37.591
He was so stuck
on getting that damn caribou.

35:37.725 --> 35:40.224
He told me he'd hire me and
my dad to run the hunting tours

35:40.272 --> 35:42.938
at his new resort if I could
help find him one.

35:43.255 --> 35:45.388
A job like that's worth
a lot of money.

35:45.450 --> 35:46.969
Of course it is.

35:47.497 --> 35:49.627
I knew there was some
on the Andreassen land

35:49.691 --> 35:51.321
this time of year. I...

35:53.068 --> 35:55.318
I didn't think anyone would be there.

35:55.419 --> 35:57.552
We were in the blind,

35:57.693 --> 36:00.497
and Adam saw movement...

36:00.919 --> 36:02.518
and he just took a shot.

36:02.708 --> 36:04.872
And it was Sarah.

36:05.717 --> 36:08.075
It was awful.

36:12.099 --> 36:13.943
Why didn't you report it?

36:14.255 --> 36:16.818
Well, Adam, he said he knew her,

36:16.935 --> 36:18.660
even left a bar with her
the night before.

36:18.708 --> 36:19.896
He said there was no way
authorities would

36:19.943 --> 36:21.052
believe it was just an accident.

36:21.099 --> 36:22.165
So, he paid

36:22.203 --> 36:24.708
you to help him
get rid of the body?

36:26.505 --> 36:28.247
I may not have killed that girl,

36:28.276 --> 36:30.466
but...

36:30.778 --> 36:32.218
if it wasn't for me,

36:32.246 --> 36:34.294
she'd still be alive.

36:44.646 --> 36:45.831
Hey.

36:45.943 --> 36:47.266
Hi.

36:47.295 --> 36:49.372
So, I'm heading to the airport,

36:49.497 --> 36:51.427
came to say good-bye.

36:51.661 --> 36:53.235
Good-bye, Sully.

36:53.450 --> 36:54.692
Thank you for everything.

36:54.740 --> 36:56.602
Any time.

36:56.794 --> 36:58.407
Stay in touch, okay?

36:58.716 --> 36:59.979
I will.

37:00.452 --> 37:01.692
Oh, um...

37:01.747 --> 37:03.275
the oboe player...

37:04.520 --> 37:06.146
do you love her?

37:06.458 --> 37:09.044
Yeah, yeah, I-I do.

37:10.470 --> 37:11.510
Does she love you?

37:12.661 --> 37:14.289
- Apparently, yes.
- Okay.

37:14.322 --> 37:17.529
You know, she's a 28-year-old
symphony musician.

37:17.715 --> 37:21.560
I am a 45-year-old
former FBI Agent

37:21.732 --> 37:23.829
who owns a sandwich shop.

37:23.974 --> 37:25.200
So?

37:25.341 --> 37:27.402
So...

37:28.372 --> 37:30.247
so, I see your point.

37:30.419 --> 37:31.927
Good.

37:32.271 --> 37:33.676
Bye, Tempe.

37:33.802 --> 37:35.372
Bye, Sully.

37:39.613 --> 37:41.513
<i>I'm telling you, with
the evidence that we've got,</i>

37:41.549 --> 37:42.789
as well as Kathleen's testimony,

37:42.817 --> 37:44.517
that guy does not
stand a chance.

37:44.552 --> 37:45.708
Ah!
Hey!

37:45.756 --> 37:47.907
Good. You guys are
already celebrating.

37:47.955 --> 37:50.585
- Yeah.
- We've got news.

37:51.005 --> 37:52.254
You got the funding?

37:52.293 --> 37:54.392
Yes. I am already
coordinating

37:54.440 --> 37:55.505
with the Andreassens

37:55.609 --> 37:57.579
to set up a start date
for the excavation dig.

37:57.661 --> 37:58.930
Amazing, okay.

37:58.978 --> 38:00.578
- To Vikings.
- Wait.

38:00.626 --> 38:01.870
With Tess and Lucy's permission,

38:01.889 --> 38:03.359
I ran some genetic tests

38:03.407 --> 38:05.060
just to confirm that
they were related.

38:05.184 --> 38:06.302
And are they?

38:06.350 --> 38:07.942
Yes, but beyond that...

38:07.990 --> 38:08.763
They also share

38:08.811 --> 38:10.482
fragments of a Norse haplogroup.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.396
Embedded
in a First Nation's genome.

38:12.451 --> 38:13.700
And appearing to date back

38:13.818 --> 38:14.990
30 generations.

38:15.038 --> 38:17.208
Well, okay, m-meaning
what, exactly?

38:17.271 --> 38:19.356
They're descended from Vikings.

38:19.426 --> 38:21.002
Okay, that is incredible. What?

38:23.057 --> 38:23.990
To Vikings!

38:24.038 --> 38:26.122
- Yes.
- Yeah, right?

38:45.010 --> 38:46.789
Welcome home.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.918
It's good to be home.

38:48.947 --> 38:50.648
I'm glad you're back.

38:50.811 --> 38:51.914
Me, too.

38:52.117 --> 38:53.437
The kids are asleep?

38:53.508 --> 38:54.969
Yes. I told them you'd

38:55.023 --> 38:56.406
go in and give them kisses.

38:56.469 --> 38:58.265
Yeah of course.

38:58.359 --> 38:59.759
What are you working on?

39:00.867 --> 39:02.853
My dad's eulogy;
it's just some notes.

39:03.961 --> 39:05.422
I'm not sure if it's any good.

39:05.470 --> 39:07.834
No, Bones, it's gonna be
great... 'cause it's coming

39:07.882 --> 39:08.962
from the heart,

39:09.032 --> 39:10.672
all right?

39:13.101 --> 39:15.602
- Booth, about Sully...
- No, you don't

39:15.673 --> 39:17.453
have to explain yourself about Sully.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.837
It's okay.
He's important to you.

39:18.930 --> 39:21.212
Yes, but...

39:21.360 --> 39:24.477
I want you to understand
why he's important.

39:24.891 --> 39:26.825
It's because without Sully

39:26.891 --> 39:31.360
I don't think I would've
been ready for you,

39:31.524 --> 39:33.368
for this...

39:33.499 --> 39:35.462
and because of that,

39:35.510 --> 39:37.665
will always be grateful to him,

39:37.773 --> 39:40.384
because... I love this.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.450
I love you.

39:45.329 --> 39:47.845
I love you, Bones...

39:48.126 --> 39:49.884
always.

40:10.875 --> 40:12.750
In Norse mythology,

40:12.829 --> 40:15.851
there is a place called Valhalla.

40:16.109 --> 40:18.219
It is the home of the Gods,

40:18.267 --> 40:22.365
but it is also the place
where the bravest warriors

40:22.413 --> 40:24.483
get to spend their afterlives.

40:24.766 --> 40:28.297
After each battle, the Valkyries or...

40:28.457 --> 40:32.992
spirit women, ride amongst
the fallen soldiers,

40:33.040 --> 40:34.969
deciding which ones
fought bravely enough

40:35.046 --> 40:37.246
to enter the land of the Gods.

40:40.567 --> 40:43.750
My father gave his life
to protect...

40:43.849 --> 40:46.319
my children.

40:46.523 --> 40:47.680
It's that kind of bravery

40:47.728 --> 40:50.359
I imagine would impress
a Valkyrie,

40:50.711 --> 40:52.805
but the impulse

40:52.853 --> 40:57.393
to protect one's offspring is...

40:57.804 --> 40:59.984
innate, it's hardwired.

41:00.033 --> 41:01.586
How could he...

41:01.720 --> 41:04.350
possibly have done any less?

41:05.941 --> 41:08.328
To me, the bravest battle

41:08.403 --> 41:10.914
Max Keenan ever fought

41:11.234 --> 41:14.125
was the one he began
over ten years ago

41:14.188 --> 41:16.388
when he reentered my life.

41:16.867 --> 41:19.281
Since then, every day...

41:19.500 --> 41:23.609
he has fought to show me
how much he loves me...

41:26.636 --> 41:31.376
and to make me believe
that I could trust him again.

41:33.765 --> 41:35.761
And he won that fight...

41:35.793 --> 41:36.993
but I do believe

41:37.028 --> 41:38.695
I was truly blessed to have

41:38.743 --> 41:40.890
a father like Max Keenan,

41:41.461 --> 41:46.165
a father who loved me so very much.

42:37.789 --> 42:40.172
Good-bye, Dad.
