00:06.800 --> 00:07.650
<b>So, then...</b>

00:08.110 --> 00:10.390
<b>Where are we on the island?</b>

00:10.780 --> 00:13.650
<b>Let's steal an Accompany card and go.</b>

00:19.580 --> 00:21.410
<b>Uninvited guests?</b>

00:25.540 --> 00:27.490
<b>I'm getting nervous...</b>

00:28.300 --> 00:30.220
<b>Just so we're clear,</b>

00:30.220 --> 00:32.280
<b>you didn't wash up on shore, right?</b>

00:32.930 --> 00:35.600
<b>After all, if you'd let the waves carry you,</b>

00:35.600 --> 00:38.460
<b>it would be impossible to reach this island.</b>

00:40.140 --> 00:41.930
<b><i>This guy's strong.</i></b>

00:42.690 --> 00:44.230
<b>Who are you?</b>

00:44.230 --> 00:46.560
<b>Are you supposed to be our tour guide?</b>

00:46.950 --> 00:49.640
<b>I'm one of the designers of this game.</b>

00:49.990 --> 00:51.390
<b>The name's Razor.</b>

00:52.190 --> 00:55.090
<b>I mainly handle the Emitter spells,</b>

00:55.090 --> 00:56.740
<b>including all movement via spells</b>

00:56.740 --> 00:58.740
<b>and dealing with external threats.</b>

00:59.490 --> 01:04.000
<b>Eliminate 

Send all trespassers 
on Greed Island to a 
random location on 
the Azian continent 

[LR][SP]</b>

01:00.250 --> 01:03.430
<b>This is a special spell only usable by Game Masters.</b>

01:04.510 --> 01:06.760
<b>Sorry, but you'll have to leave.</b>

01:08.030 --> 01:11.140
<b>You're more than welcome to 
visit via official channels.</b>

01:11.140 --> 01:14.880
<b>From there, if you defeat me, 
you can receive an item.</b>

01:15.330 --> 01:16.450
<b>Should you decide to play,</b>

01:16.450 --> 01:19.010
<b>we'll probably get to fight eventually.</b>

01:19.470 --> 01:20.560
<b>Sounds good...</b>

01:20.560 --> 01:21.810
<b>We'll come back.</b>

01:21.810 --> 01:23.770
<b>Through the front door.</b>

01:24.020 --> 01:25.690
<b><i>Eliminate on.</i></b>

01:29.810 --> 01:33.930
<b>Hmm, those were some strong <i>Nen</i> users...</b>

03:09.960 --> 03:15.000
<b>Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors</b>

03:17.090 --> 03:19.160
<b>As Gon continues to train,</b>

03:19.160 --> 03:22.510
<b>he discovers a hint to developing 
a new technique, and that is...</b>

03:22.960 --> 03:24.970
<b><i>First comes rock!</i></b>

03:25.670 --> 03:27.260
<b><i>Rock... Paper...</i></b>

03:27.260 --> 03:28.580
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

03:35.670 --> 03:36.780
<b>I see.</b>

03:37.090 --> 03:38.030
<b>Here comes the next one!</b>

03:38.630 --> 03:40.780
<b><i>First comes rock!</i></b>

03:41.260 --> 03:42.530
<b><i>Rock... Paper...</i></b>

03:42.530 --> 03:43.860
<b><i>Paper!</i></b>

03:46.830 --> 03:49.600
<b>Bisky, how do I make my <i>Nen</i> fly?</b>

03:50.310 --> 03:51.420
<b>Train more!</b>

03:51.910 --> 03:53.420
<b>So paper is an Emitter technique?</b>

03:53.930 --> 03:54.570
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

03:54.980 --> 03:56.790
<b>And Scissors is a Transmuter technique.</b>

03:57.310 --> 04:00.170
<b>I wanna be able to cut through rock.</b>

04:00.540 --> 04:01.690
<b>I understand.</b>

04:01.690 --> 04:03.680
<b>That's a reasonable fighting technique.</b>

04:04.400 --> 04:06.180
<b><i>But such a childish idea.</i></b>

04:06.770 --> 04:10.600
<b>You know how it takes time 
to focus <i>Nen</i> in my fist?</b>

04:11.010 --> 04:14.180
<b>I was trying to think of a good 
way to spend that time.</b>

04:14.960 --> 04:18.280
<b>And when you were talking about 
rock-paper-scissors, it hit me.</b>

04:18.280 --> 04:20.280
<b>Because I like rock-paper-scissors.</b>

04:20.960 --> 04:23.530
<b>Trusting your instincts is important.</b>

04:23.530 --> 04:26.560
<b>Your gut plays a big role in 
techniques that require</b>

04:26.560 --> 04:28.330
<b>multiple <i>Nen</i> categories.</b>

04:28.850 --> 04:31.150
<b>The key is that it should feel right to you.</b>

04:31.800 --> 04:33.130
<b>Ah... Ahem.</b>

04:41.730 --> 04:44.320
<b>Well, this is all I can manage right now,</b>

04:44.320 --> 04:46.500
<b>but if I charge it up, it's pretty strong.</b>

04:47.370 --> 04:49.140
<b>That's awesome, Killua!</b>

04:49.140 --> 04:50.720
<b>You're like an electric eel!</b>

04:50.720 --> 04:52.020
<b>That's a horrible comparison!</b>

04:53.520 --> 04:57.020
<b><i>He can already change </i>Nen <i>into 
electricity at such a young age?</i></b>

04:57.640 --> 04:58.810
<b><i>Frightening...</i></b>

04:59.390 --> 05:02.030
<b><i>And very tragic...</i></b>

05:02.880 --> 05:05.030
<b><i>His childhood must have been a living hell.</i></b>

05:05.510 --> 05:09.380
<b><i>It's a miracle that he can smile now.</i></b>

05:13.570 --> 05:15.040
<b><i>Indeed...</i></b>

05:16.340 --> 05:18.290
<b><i>They make a great team.</i></b>

05:20.870 --> 05:23.760
<b>Well, let's take a break, then.</b>

05:24.810 --> 05:27.280
<b>It's a little early, but we can have a party.</b>

05:27.280 --> 05:28.420
<b>A party?</b>

05:28.420 --> 05:31.240
<b>What do you boys do back home to celebrate?</b>

05:31.240 --> 05:32.310
<b>Celebrate?</b>

05:33.450 --> 05:36.440
<b>In the outside world, it's almost New Year's.</b>

05:37.310 --> 05:40.250
<b>Time flows at the same speed 
inside the game as outside.</b>

05:40.890 --> 05:41.800
<b>Oops!</b>

05:42.960 --> 05:46.700
<b>The deadline to apply for the 
Hunter Exam is coming up!</b>

05:47.120 --> 05:50.700
<b>And our training was just starting to get fun...</b>

05:51.160 --> 05:54.290
<b>I believe you're required to apply 
before the end of the year.</b>

05:54.660 --> 05:56.130
<b>We need to hurry.</b>

05:56.130 --> 05:58.410
<b>How do we get outside?</b>

05:58.770 --> 06:01.380
<b>I'm guessing there are spell 
cards to leave the game?</b>

06:01.800 --> 06:05.010
<b>In that case, let's head to Masadora.</b>

06:05.430 --> 06:06.470
<b>Agreed!</b>

06:08.410 --> 06:11.250
<b>Well, let's find a place to have a drink.</b>

06:11.250 --> 06:14.030
<b>We can't... There's no time.</b>

06:14.030 --> 06:16.270
<b>We can ask around the stores.</b>

06:17.400 --> 06:19.270
<b>How to leave the island?</b>

06:19.830 --> 06:22.200
<b>That'll be 3,000 Jenny.</b>

06:24.700 --> 06:27.150
<b>If you go about fifty kilometers west,</b>

06:27.150 --> 06:29.410
<b>you'll reach the island's only port.</b>

06:29.820 --> 06:34.030
<b>You must defeat or bribe 
the chief of that port</b>

06:34.030 --> 06:36.290
<b>to receive a ticket that will 
transport you outside.</b>

06:36.770 --> 06:38.540
<b>How big of a bribe are we talking?</b>

06:38.990 --> 06:40.880
<b>Depends on how the chief's feeling.</b>

06:40.880 --> 06:41.790
<b>Ah...</b>

06:42.140 --> 06:45.450
<b>Your other option is to 
use a Leave spell card,</b>

06:45.450 --> 06:47.550
<b>but that's a rare one.</b>

06:48.230 --> 06:49.360
<b>What do we do?</b>

06:49.360 --> 06:50.680
<b>Let's head for the port.</b>

06:50.680 --> 06:54.140
<b>If it's a rare card, we could buy 
a bunch without finding one.</b>

06:54.480 --> 06:55.510
<b>True.</b>

07:05.400 --> 07:06.820
<b>Passage Ticket</b>

07:05.410 --> 07:06.220
<b>Voil√†.</b>

07:07.450 --> 07:10.640
<b>Well, I'll go pass the test real 
quick, and then hurry back.</b>

07:11.340 --> 07:14.410
<b>There are monsters called Kiriko 
that live beneath a cedar tree</b>

07:14.410 --> 07:16.450
<b>on the mountain behind Dolle Harbor.</b>

07:16.740 --> 07:18.580
<b>If you tell them you're my friend,</b>

07:18.580 --> 07:20.210
<b>they'll take you to the exam area.</b>

07:20.670 --> 07:21.700
<b>Okay.</b>

07:21.700 --> 07:22.530
<b>See ya.</b>

07:26.970 --> 07:30.220
<b>Then let's get back to training.</b>

07:30.220 --> 07:31.010
<b>Osu!</b>

07:43.280 --> 07:44.270
<b>Welcome.</b>

07:44.950 --> 07:46.680
<b><i>Is this where I started?</i></b>

07:48.000 --> 07:49.370
<b><i>No, it's not...</i></b>

07:49.870 --> 07:51.460
<b><i>The girl looks similar, though.</i></b>

07:52.170 --> 07:54.530
<b><i>Well, that's not so unusual in games.</i></b>

07:55.000 --> 07:56.800
<b>You are leaving the island, right?</b>

07:57.100 --> 07:59.500
<b>Please select a destination.</b>

08:00.680 --> 08:01.780
<b>Do you know Dolle Harbor?</b>

08:02.120 --> 08:03.690
<b>Yes, I do.</b>

08:04.110 --> 08:05.290
<b>Then send me there.</b>

08:05.810 --> 08:07.120
<b>Understood.</b>

08:08.550 --> 08:10.240
<b>When you leave this island,</b>

08:10.240 --> 08:13.650
<b>the cards in your free slots will disappear.</b>

08:13.650 --> 08:14.990
<b>Is that okay?</b>

08:15.300 --> 08:16.550
<b>Yeah, it's fine.</b>

08:17.210 --> 08:20.470
<b>Then we shall await your return.</b>

08:26.990 --> 08:29.310
<b><i>I'm back in the real world now?</i></b>

08:29.900 --> 08:31.830
<b><i>Doesn't feel that way.</i></b>

08:32.800 --> 08:33.630
<b><i>Book.</i></b>

08:35.190 --> 08:37.620
<b><i>Oh, it doesn't work out here.</i></b>

08:39.680 --> 08:42.810
<b><i>Once I submit my application, 
I'll head for that cedar tree.</i></b>

08:43.790 --> 08:45.960
<b><i>First, I should shower and 
change into fresh clothes.</i></b>

08:48.030 --> 08:50.380
<b>Okay, train while you run!</b>

08:51.010 --> 08:55.110
<b>When you can form the numbers from 0 to 9 
in one minute, you'll clear this stage.</b>

08:58.800 --> 09:01.390
<b>That hurt!</b>

09:01.880 --> 09:03.560
<b>What are you doing?</b>

09:09.290 --> 09:10.580
<b>Aren't you...</b>

09:11.090 --> 09:13.240
<b>Your other friend isn't here?</b>

09:14.130 --> 09:16.210
<b>What's that machine on your shoulder?</b>

09:16.210 --> 09:18.160
<b>Did something happen?</b>

09:18.950 --> 09:20.590
<b>We were fooled by the Bomber.</b>

09:20.840 --> 09:23.480
<b>Will you listen to my story?</b>

09:27.400 --> 09:29.130
<b>So he was the Bomber...</b>

09:29.670 --> 09:34.060
<b>The others are waiting at our base for 
the Bomber to disarm the bombs.</b>

09:34.870 --> 09:36.730
<b>They believe the terms he gave them,</b>

09:36.730 --> 09:38.890
<b>even though it was probably a bluff.</b>

09:39.460 --> 09:41.620
<b>Can't anything be done?</b>

09:41.620 --> 09:43.820
<b>If they're prepared to accept casualties...</b>

09:43.820 --> 09:44.890
<b>It's impossible.</b>

09:45.550 --> 09:50.140
<b>The first people to attack 
will be the ones who die.</b>

09:50.560 --> 09:52.410
<b>Who would volunteer for that role?</b>

09:53.470 --> 09:54.400
<b>True...</b>

09:55.010 --> 09:58.030
<b>Jispa was our group's strongest fighter,</b>

09:58.030 --> 10:00.160
<b>and he was defeated in an instant.</b>

10:00.600 --> 10:02.960
<b>At that point, our loss was assured.</b>

10:03.890 --> 10:06.220
<b>And allowing him to leave the game</b>

10:06.220 --> 10:07.590
<b>was a fatal mistake.</b>

10:09.110 --> 10:11.190
<b>We indulged in a moment's victory cheer</b>

10:11.190 --> 10:14.960
<b>before we could verify each 
member's cards and assign roles.</b>

10:15.640 --> 10:17.970
<b>That's when he caught us off guard.</b>

10:19.090 --> 10:20.470
<b>It's embarrassing to admit,</b>

10:21.080 --> 10:24.710
<b>but I was so distracted, 
I didn't notice him using Leave</b>

10:24.710 --> 10:26.840
<b>until it was already too late.</b>

10:27.790 --> 10:32.360
<b>You were probably focused on 
understanding his explanation.</b>

10:32.710 --> 10:33.530
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:33.800 --> 10:37.640
<b>We were thrust into that 
situation with no warning.</b>

10:37.950 --> 10:41.210
<b>Given our mental state, there was 
no action we could have taken.</b>

10:41.610 --> 10:45.120
<b>But why are you telling us this?</b>

10:46.510 --> 10:48.960
<b>Because, of everyone I've met on this island,</b>

10:48.960 --> 10:51.680
<b>you are the ones I believe I can most rely on.</b>

10:53.320 --> 10:55.680
<b>If you run into any other players,</b>

10:55.680 --> 10:58.370
<b>please tell them about the Bomber.</b>

10:58.900 --> 11:00.660
<b>Once everyone knows how his ability works,</b>

11:00.660 --> 11:02.140
<b>they should be able to protect themselves.</b>

11:02.760 --> 11:06.400
<b>And if possible, I would 
like you to avenge us!</b>

11:07.170 --> 11:08.160
<b>If not,</b>

11:08.160 --> 11:11.210
<b>could you at least promise that 
you won't let him clear the game?</b>

11:12.390 --> 11:12.960
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:13.280 --> 11:14.400
<b>Understood.</b>

11:14.980 --> 11:15.970
<b>Sorry...</b>

11:18.690 --> 11:20.450
<b>I'll use what time I have remaining</b>

11:20.450 --> 11:23.230
<b>to tell as many as I can about the Bomber.</b>

11:23.910 --> 11:24.550
<b><i>Book.</i></b>

11:25.590 --> 11:26.810
<b><i>Return on.</i></b>

11:26.810 --> 11:27.540
<b>Bunzen!</b>

11:36.630 --> 11:37.720
<b><i>Just kidding...</i></b>

11:38.270 --> 11:42.170
<b><i>The truth is that they were 
the only players I could find</i></b>

11:42.170 --> 11:44.050
<b><i>using Magnetic Force.</i></b>

11:45.330 --> 11:47.550
<b><i>Even a pig can climb a tree if 
you give it enough praise.</i></b>

11:48.050 --> 11:49.940
<b><i>Every thousandth of a percent counts</i></b>

11:49.940 --> 11:53.120
<b><i>when it comes to deactivating someone's </i>Nen.</b>

11:54.050 --> 11:58.380
<b><i>Well, Nickes probably left to 
meet with the bombers.</i></b>

11:59.130 --> 12:01.200
<b><i>If the mass disarmament</i></b>

12:01.560 --> 12:04.260
<b><i>turns out to be a mass explosion...</i></b>

12:06.340 --> 12:07.450
<b><i>I should get started.</i></b>

12:16.020 --> 12:17.960
<b>You're finally here.</b>

12:18.430 --> 12:20.460
<b>Now give me your ring.</b>

12:21.290 --> 12:23.220
<b>Jispa's dead.</b>

12:23.590 --> 12:25.470
<b>That's nice. Your ring.</b>

12:26.520 --> 12:28.470
<b>Disarm everyone's bombs first!</b>

12:29.310 --> 12:30.470
<b>Hell, no.</b>

12:30.840 --> 12:33.630
<b>I have to enter the game with your ring,</b>

12:33.920 --> 12:38.480
<b>and confirm that the cards 
really are all inside.</b>

12:39.020 --> 12:40.990
<b>I'll disarm the bombs after that.</b>

12:41.580 --> 12:43.100
<b>I'll give you one more chance.</b>

12:44.480 --> 12:45.990
<b>Hand over the ring.</b>

12:53.730 --> 12:55.270
<b>Sub, put it on.</b>

12:56.490 --> 12:59.410
<b>If you put on a second ring outside the game,</b>

12:59.410 --> 13:01.570
<b>you'll overwrite the data.</b>

13:02.970 --> 13:06.060
<b>Now, let's head back inside together.</b>

13:06.480 --> 13:09.010
<b>Wait, what was your name?</b>

13:16.920 --> 13:19.480
<b><i>Migamura, Samingadura,</i></b>

13:19.780 --> 13:22.530
<b><i>Interaminga, Zenberarubura.</i></b>

13:23.020 --> 13:24.590
<b><i>Spirits of the forest,</i></b>

13:24.940 --> 13:28.020
<b><i>remove the tainted</i> Nen <i>that resides within me.</i></b>

13:35.640 --> 13:36.570
<b><i>Now, then...</i></b>

13:37.880 --> 13:39.800
<b><i>What horrors will come of this?</i></b>

13:44.020 --> 13:46.320
<b><i>I borrow power from the forest spirits,</i></b>

13:46.670 --> 13:48.620
<b><i>to use my Conjurer ability</i></b>

13:49.170 --> 13:52.790
<b><i>to create a</i> Nen <i>beast, capable of 
consuming other people's </i>Nen!</b>

13:56.980 --> 13:57.870
<b><i>It's huge!</i></b>

13:58.420 --> 14:02.470
<b><i>The Bomber's Countdown must be 
a particularly strong technique.</i></b>

14:05.870 --> 14:06.970
<b>How'd it go?</b>

14:06.970 --> 14:08.460
<b>Has he disarmed the bombs yet?</b>

14:09.730 --> 14:10.320
<b><i>Book.</i></b>

14:15.380 --> 14:17.820
<b>81 restricted slot card types.</b>

14:17.820 --> 14:19.710
<b>They're all here, all right.</b>

14:19.710 --> 14:21.900
<b>We did as you requested...</b>

14:21.900 --> 14:23.590
<b>Disarm the bombs!</b>

14:24.090 --> 14:25.370
<b>But of course.</b>

14:25.370 --> 14:26.770
<b>I'm a man of my word.</b>

14:26.770 --> 14:29.840
<b>But first, hand over three Leave cards.</b>

14:33.770 --> 14:36.110
<b>Okay, we have a deal.</b>

14:36.490 --> 14:37.880
<b>Sub... Bara...</b>

15:00.550 --> 15:01.490
<b>Let's do this.</b>

15:05.980 --> 15:06.960
<b>Release.</b>

15:28.690 --> 15:30.330
<b>I released you</b>

15:31.570 --> 15:33.240
<b>from your terror.</b>

15:36.430 --> 15:39.370
<b>Th-That wasn't the deal...</b>

15:41.640 --> 15:43.290
<b>Why should I keep a promise</b>

15:43.290 --> 15:45.880
<b>I made to a bunch of scum?</b>

15:46.260 --> 15:49.880
<b>Release was the signal to explode, not disarm.</b>

15:54.270 --> 15:55.550
<b><i>Leave on!</i></b>

15:59.780 --> 16:03.170
<b><i>At least now, I don't have 
to worry about exploding.</i></b>

16:05.780 --> 16:10.940
<b><i>But until Genthru reverses his ability or dies,</i></b>

16:11.250 --> 16:13.670
<b><i>this thing won't disappear.</i></b>

16:14.930 --> 16:17.810
<b><i>I have a troublesome partner now...</i></b>

16:21.270 --> 16:22.710
<b>Hey, stop moving!</b>

16:24.210 --> 16:26.630
<b><i>The Bomber thinks he killed us all.</i></b>

16:27.540 --> 16:29.350
<b><i>I'll let him believe that...</i></b>

16:30.230 --> 16:31.840
<b><i>Until I make my move!</i></b>

16:39.720 --> 16:40.470
<b>Bisky...</b>

16:43.240 --> 16:46.760
<b>I think we should drop by 
their base real fast.</b>

16:47.610 --> 16:49.450
<b>They already ran out of time.</b>

16:50.020 --> 16:53.240
<b>Besides, he didn't even 
tell us exactly where it is.</b>

16:53.720 --> 16:55.500
<b>And even if we did know,</b>

16:55.500 --> 16:59.240
<b>we don't have a spell card 
that could take us there.</b>

16:59.860 --> 17:01.100
<b>I know.</b>

17:01.100 --> 17:04.850
<b>But some of them might have 
survived the explosion...</b>

17:04.850 --> 17:06.010
<b>Doubt it.</b>

17:06.760 --> 17:10.920
<b>If the Bomber's strong enough to place bombs 
on all his targets without anyone noticing,</b>

17:11.330 --> 17:13.290
<b>he wouldn't have made that kind of mistake.</b>

17:14.560 --> 17:15.300
<b>However...</b>

17:16.090 --> 17:18.400
<b>If we continue to play this game,</b>

17:18.400 --> 17:20.530
<b>we'll probably run into the Bomber.</b>

17:21.190 --> 17:26.040
<b>Given that, we may need 
to visit their base soon.</b>

17:26.040 --> 17:26.700
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

17:27.670 --> 17:29.120
<b>We need spell cards.</b>

17:29.560 --> 17:31.770
<b>Let's go to Masadora and 
sell our monster cards</b>

17:31.770 --> 17:32.810
<b>to buy spell cards.</b>

17:33.490 --> 17:34.280
<b>Yeah!</b>

17:38.030 --> 17:38.980
<b>Hey, Bisky...</b>

17:39.350 --> 17:42.560
<b>How long do you think it'll take me 
to master my special technique?</b>

17:43.000 --> 17:45.660
<b>You're just starting to develop your <i>Nen</i>.</b>

17:45.660 --> 17:48.230
<b>It's hard to predict when your 
power and speed will peak.</b>

17:48.590 --> 17:49.720
<b>Oh...</b>

17:49.720 --> 17:53.430
<b>But it shouldn't take too long</b>

17:53.430 --> 17:55.170
<b>before you get the form down.</b>

17:55.610 --> 17:57.280
<b>Really? How long?</b>

17:57.700 --> 17:59.190
<b>Let's see...</b>

18:01.600 --> 18:04.640
<b>Hopefully, you'll have it ready 
by the time Killua returns.</b>

18:06.330 --> 18:07.450
<b>All right!</b>

18:07.450 --> 18:10.340
<b>I'll finish my technique and surprise him!</b>

18:16.670 --> 18:18.650
<b>You two are lucky!</b>

18:18.650 --> 18:22.200
<b>We just received a huge 
shipment of spell cards.</b>

18:22.990 --> 18:25.340
<b><i>These are the spell cards they'd gathered.</i></b>

18:29.390 --> 18:32.960
<b>We bought sixty between us, 
so there are lots of different types.</b>

18:34.690 --> 18:35.460
<b>Look.</b>

18:36.970 --> 18:40.970
<b>Prison

18:37.680 --> 18:38.780
<b>An S-rank card...</b>

18:38.780 --> 18:40.670
<b>There are only ten in the whole game!</b>

18:41.250 --> 18:42.200
<b>What do you think?</b>

18:42.200 --> 18:42.920
<b>Should we save it?</b>

18:42.920 --> 18:44.470
<b>Or use it now?</b>

18:44.760 --> 18:47.290
<b>I don't know what to do!</b>

18:47.290 --> 18:48.020
<b>Shh!</b>

18:48.020 --> 18:49.400
<b>You're too loud...</b>

18:49.400 --> 18:50.730
<b>People will get suspicious!</b>

18:53.150 --> 18:55.620
<b><i>If only Killua were here...</i></b>

19:02.650 --> 19:04.790
<b>I can smell Gon on you.</b>

19:05.370 --> 19:06.750
<b>I'd like to see him again...</b>

19:09.200 --> 19:11.990
<b>We'll take you to the exam site.</b>

19:12.400 --> 19:15.070
<b>I need to zip on over and 
breeze through the exam,</b>

19:15.070 --> 19:17.300
<b>so I can hurry back to Gon.</b>

19:17.710 --> 19:21.640
<b>But the exam won't begin for a few days.</b>

19:22.020 --> 19:23.260
<b>Oh, right.</b>

19:23.800 --> 19:27.570
<b>In the meantime, you can tell 
us about yourself and Gon.</b>

19:27.900 --> 19:29.000
<b>Okay.</b>

19:29.000 --> 19:32.590
<b>I'll start with the story about 
when he came to visit my home.</b>

19:45.280 --> 19:47.410
<b>You're making steady progress.</b>

19:47.410 --> 19:50.230
<b>You're on track to have your 
special technique ready.</b>

19:50.780 --> 19:53.420
<b>This is a safe place to practice.</b>

19:53.860 --> 19:58.800
<b>Since we'll be able to spot anyone 
before they're in attack spell range.</b>

19:59.780 --> 20:01.840
<b>I can sense people watching from Masadora,</b>

20:01.840 --> 20:04.980
<b>just like I sensed people 
watching us at the start point.</b>

20:05.770 --> 20:08.680
<b>But we have plenty of defense spells now.</b>

20:10.150 --> 20:11.930
<b>Well, just to be safe,</b>

20:11.930 --> 20:14.660
<b>I used a Blackout Curtain card.</b>

20:12.210 --> 20:14.940
<b>Blackout Curtain 

Block one instance of enemy Steal or Fluoroscopy. 
(Does not stack when used on target already under 
effect of Blackout Curtain.)

20:16.100 --> 20:19.520
<b>But no point in worrying about spell cards.</b>

20:19.960 --> 20:22.100
<b>Just focus on training hard.</b>

20:22.690 --> 20:23.590
<b>Osu!</b>

20:30.970 --> 20:32.740
<b>Okay, one minute's up.</b>

20:33.620 --> 20:34.460
<b>Next.</b>

20:42.870 --> 20:43.810
<b>It didn't work.</b>

20:43.810 --> 20:45.440
<b>I can't reach it...</b>

20:45.440 --> 20:46.730
<b>That was just fine.</b>

20:46.730 --> 20:49.970
<b>You're in far better shape than 
a Transmuter would be!</b>

20:50.600 --> 20:53.930
<b>Be patient, and start by focusing 
on maintaining your aura</b>

20:53.930 --> 20:56.680
<b>in a sphere for extended periods of time.</b>

20:57.210 --> 20:57.980
<b>Osu!</b>

20:58.380 --> 21:02.870
<b>The longer you can maintain the 
sphere, the stronger your <i>Ten</i>.</b>

21:03.400 --> 21:04.740
<b>Once you've trained long enough,</b>

21:05.170 --> 21:10.470
<b>you'll be able to maintain an aura 
sphere for two to three days!</b>

21:11.980 --> 21:14.770
<b>You should be able to reach that 
stone before the day's out.</b>

21:21.240 --> 21:22.900
<b>You're right! I reached it!</b>

21:22.900 --> 21:23.760
<b>That was fast!</b>

21:24.490 --> 21:28.070
<b><i>This proves he's been hard at work 
on his</i> Ten <i>and</i> Ren <i>every day</i>.</b>

21:29.520 --> 21:32.660
<b>Then, we'll go back to practicing the basics.</b>

21:33.660 --> 21:34.530
<b>Osu!</b>

21:36.510 --> 21:40.580
<b>Gon continues to train with Bisky,

21:41.730 --> 21:45.430
