00:04.564 --> 00:07.830
I think people think of their office
as a stationery store with Danish.

00:08.002 --> 00:10.197
You know what I mean?
You wanna get your pastry...

00:10.371 --> 00:12.430
...your envelopes, your supplies...

00:12.606 --> 00:15.575
...your toilet paper, six cups of coffee,
and you go home.

00:16.043 --> 00:17.704
Why do people that work in offices...

00:17.878 --> 00:21.075
...have pictures of their family
on their desk facing them?

00:21.315 --> 00:23.340
Do they forget that they're married?

00:23.517 --> 00:26.350
Do they go, "5:00. Time to hit the bars
and pick up hookers.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.511
Hold it a second.

00:28.689 --> 00:31.317
I got a wife and three kids.
I better get home.

00:31.492 --> 00:32.857
I completely forgot."

00:39.967 --> 00:43.494
- She hasn't told her father yet?
- We're supposed to tell him tonight.

00:43.671 --> 00:46.697
- What do you mean, "we're"?
- Susan wants me to be there.

00:46.874 --> 00:49.172
You're meeting the father
for the first time?

00:49.343 --> 00:53.575
- Yeah.
- You'll make quite an impression...

00:53.747 --> 00:56.341
...when you tell him how
you burned his cabin down.

00:57.685 --> 01:00.017
I didn't burn it down. Kramer did.

01:00.187 --> 01:03.520
I mean, the whole thing is ironic.
Think of it.

01:03.691 --> 01:06.717
The guy's nice enough to give you
a box of very fine Cuban cigars...

01:06.894 --> 01:08.361
- I know what happened.
- No, wait.

01:08.529 --> 01:11.623
- Then you dump them off onto Kramer.
- I know.

01:11.799 --> 01:15.963
Who proceeds to burn
the man's cabin down...

01:16.136 --> 01:19.537
...with one of those
very same cigars.

01:20.074 --> 01:22.372
It's very comical.

01:23.277 --> 01:25.211
Maybe we shouldn't
start writing today.

01:25.379 --> 01:26.607
I got a lot on my mind.

01:26.780 --> 01:29.044
We've put this off long enough.
Today's the day.

01:29.216 --> 01:31.184
I wonder how Susan's
father's gonna react.

01:31.351 --> 01:33.683
What's the worst he can do?
So you burn a house down.

01:33.854 --> 01:35.082
Come on.

01:35.322 --> 01:37.051
Not even a house. It's like a cabin.

01:37.224 --> 01:38.816
We could build a cabin like that.

01:38.992 --> 01:41.620
Well, maybe not us,
but two men could.

01:43.731 --> 01:45.028
BICs? What, did you get BICs?

01:45.199 --> 01:47.099
What, you got a problem
with the pen, now?

01:47.267 --> 01:49.064
I like a Rolling Writer.
They're smooth.

01:49.236 --> 01:51.670
All right, let's just get to work.

01:52.206 --> 01:54.367
NBC pilot. Seinfeld Project.

01:54.541 --> 01:57.840
Act 1, Scene A.

01:58.011 --> 02:00.741
So you're gonna sit there?

02:01.415 --> 02:02.677
Let me explain to you...

02:02.850 --> 02:05.444
...one of the key elements involved
in the writing process.

02:05.619 --> 02:07.109
Because it may seem outwardly...

02:07.287 --> 02:10.120
...that the pen and the paper
and the chair play a large role.

02:10.457 --> 02:15.759
But they're all somewhat incidental
to the actual using of the brain.

02:16.029 --> 02:18.964
Okay, so just... Just park yourself.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.260
All right. Act 1, Scene A.

02:21.435 --> 02:23.926
- Drink?
- No. No drink.

02:25.539 --> 02:29.407
- All right. Here we go.
- Act 1, Scene A.

02:35.516 --> 02:38.349
- Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
- Yes.

02:44.958 --> 02:46.687
Hi, is Elaine there?

02:46.860 --> 02:48.452
Oh, hi, Sandra.

02:49.329 --> 02:50.557
Yeah, I can hold.

02:50.731 --> 02:54.462
Every time I call, I gotta chitchat
with her assistant for, like, 20 minutes.

02:54.635 --> 02:56.830
Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen,
I'm at a pay phone.

02:57.004 --> 02:59.063
There's a lot of people
waiting to use it.

02:59.239 --> 03:02.037
I'll be off in a minute!

03:02.209 --> 03:04.074
Yeah, could you put me through
to Elaine?

03:04.244 --> 03:06.610
Okay, thanks.

03:07.181 --> 03:09.775
Are you thinking of ideas?

03:10.150 --> 03:11.879
Is there any way I can
get you directly?

03:12.052 --> 03:15.579
Every time I call, Sandra bends
my ear for, like, 20 minutes.

03:15.756 --> 03:16.984
So we're on for later?

03:17.191 --> 03:19.352
Yeah, I'll come by after work.

03:19.526 --> 03:22.359
Hey, I got a rubber-pencil thing
happening here.

03:23.697 --> 03:24.925
I gotta go. I gotta go.

03:25.098 --> 03:26.929
Sandra? Sandra?

03:27.100 --> 03:28.533
Can you come here
for a second?

03:29.269 --> 03:30.702
- Okay. Let's go.
- Here we go.

03:30.871 --> 03:32.930
- You got it? Here we go.
- Yeah.

03:34.041 --> 03:35.338
Okay, how about this:

03:35.509 --> 03:39.001
I'm in my apartment.
You come in.

03:39.179 --> 03:41.147
It's beautiful.

03:42.349 --> 03:44.340
And what do I say?

03:50.858 --> 03:52.849
Could you do me a favor?

03:53.026 --> 03:54.550
When my friends call...

03:54.928 --> 03:57.692
...could you not talk to them
for too long?

03:58.365 --> 04:00.060
Why, did Jerry say something?

04:00.234 --> 04:01.724
No. No.

04:01.902 --> 04:03.199
He must've said something.

04:03.370 --> 04:04.735
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.

04:04.905 --> 04:06.338
- I can't work for you.
- Oh, God.

04:06.506 --> 04:09.339
- I can't. I'm leaving.
- No, Sandra...

04:09.509 --> 04:11.602
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.

04:11.778 --> 04:14.713
Listen, Jerry's under a lot
of pressure right now.

04:14.882 --> 04:17.577
It's very hard being
a stand-up comedian.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.584
Sometimes they don't laugh.

04:23.490 --> 04:26.050
- All right, let's get going.
- All right, let's go to work.

04:26.226 --> 04:27.523
- Let's go.
- Okay.

04:27.861 --> 04:30.659
- Hey.
- We're in the middle of something.

04:30.831 --> 04:33.391
- We're trying to do a little work here.
- Yeah, come on.

04:33.567 --> 04:34.864
What's with you?

04:35.035 --> 04:37.230
- No more golf.
- Why?

04:37.604 --> 04:40.630
Remember I told you about the pro
at the Westchester Country Club...

04:40.807 --> 04:43.742
...who's letting me play every time
I gave him those Cuban cigars?

04:43.911 --> 04:46.744
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!

04:50.517 --> 04:54.578
Hey, George, maybe you can
ask Susan's father for some more.

04:54.755 --> 04:55.983
What are you, crazy?

04:56.156 --> 04:59.421
I can't ask the guy for more cigars
after you burned down his cabin.

04:59.593 --> 05:01.493
What's one thing got to do
with another?

05:02.596 --> 05:03.824
Kramer, please.

05:03.997 --> 05:06.192
Well, I can't go back
to the public courses now.

05:06.366 --> 05:08.766
I can't. I won't.

05:08.936 --> 05:11.131
I mean, you know what that's like?
It's crowded.

05:11.305 --> 05:13.535
The grass has
big brown patches in it.

05:13.707 --> 05:15.072
They don't rake the sand traps.

05:15.242 --> 05:18.211
Not to mention the caliber of people
you have to play with.

05:18.645 --> 05:21.614
I can't help you. You're gonna have to
get them someplace else.

05:21.782 --> 05:23.773
Where? They're Cubans.

05:24.651 --> 05:27.211
- You know what? I should take off.
- What?

05:27.387 --> 05:30.151
I gotta go to Susan's parents' house
for dinner.

05:30.324 --> 05:33.020
I wanna shower first,
and I wanna leave plenty of time.

05:33.193 --> 05:35.320
You got four hours.
What about the script?

05:35.729 --> 05:37.492
I think we got a bite on it.

05:42.970 --> 05:45.962
Doesn't George look like
your sister Sara?

05:49.376 --> 05:51.071
A slight resemblance.

05:51.878 --> 05:53.778
Her son's a podiatrist, you know.

05:54.214 --> 05:58.344
Oh, I have tremendous respect
for people who work with feet.

05:58.518 --> 06:01.351
I mean, to dedicate yourself
to the foot...

06:02.189 --> 06:05.716
You're toiling in virtual anonymity.
I mean...

06:08.328 --> 06:10.319
How are you enjoying those cigars
I gave you?

06:11.431 --> 06:13.899
Oh, the cigars.

06:14.067 --> 06:16.661
I'm sucking them down.

06:16.837 --> 06:19.328
I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.

06:19.506 --> 06:21.838
You know, those cigars
are made special for Castro.

06:22.843 --> 06:24.936
I did not know that.

06:25.112 --> 06:26.409
Weird. Wild.

06:27.714 --> 06:31.548
- What?
- He's doing Johnny Carson, Daddy.

06:31.852 --> 06:33.581
I didn't care much for his jokes.

06:34.821 --> 06:37.722
- Daddy never laughs.
- Oh, well, so what?

06:37.891 --> 06:39.882
Laughter. What is that?

06:40.060 --> 06:43.587
I mean, what is the point
of opening your mouth and going:

06:44.998 --> 06:46.693
What is that?

06:49.236 --> 06:51.397
You know, you can't get
those cigars anywhere.

06:51.571 --> 06:54.267
You and your cigars.

06:54.441 --> 06:56.739
Wear some more lipstick.

06:59.513 --> 07:02.846
Daddy, there's... There's something
that we have to talk to you about.

07:03.016 --> 07:06.110
Oh, I forgot to ask you:
how'd you like the cabin?

07:06.753 --> 07:09.051
Oh, the... The cabin.

07:09.222 --> 07:10.883
Well...

07:14.461 --> 07:16.190
After we get off the phone
you tell her?

07:16.363 --> 07:18.354
Of course she knows it was me
who complained.

07:18.532 --> 07:20.466
Now I'm responsible
for this woman quitting.

07:20.634 --> 07:23.728
- Oh, this is unbelievable.
- I know.

07:23.904 --> 07:26.634
I screwed up. It's all my fault.

07:26.807 --> 07:29.742
- Would you call her?
- Oh, dial the number.

07:32.979 --> 07:34.469
How could you do this?

07:34.648 --> 07:36.673
I was just trying to help you.

07:36.850 --> 07:39.648
Trying to help me.

07:40.687 --> 07:42.382
Hello. Sandra.

07:42.556 --> 07:44.183
Hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

07:44.357 --> 07:47.815
Listen, I wanted to tell you there's
been a terrible misunderstanding.

07:47.994 --> 07:49.791
See, I told Elaine...

07:49.963 --> 07:53.091
...that it was a real treat
talking to you on the phone.

07:53.266 --> 07:56.599
And she thought I was being sarcastic
because I'm a comedian, and all.

07:56.770 --> 08:00.206
She thought, I think, "Yeah, it's a
real treat talking to her on the phone."

08:00.373 --> 08:03.570
But I was really being sincere.

08:03.743 --> 08:06.143
No, of course I like you.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.375
Tonight?

08:11.985 --> 08:13.213
Hold on a second.

08:13.386 --> 08:15.650
- She wants to have a drink with me.
- Just go. Go.

08:15.822 --> 08:17.517
- Oh, I don't...
- Go.

08:17.691 --> 08:19.989
Yeah, I think I can.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.455
Yeah, I know where that is.

08:22.629 --> 08:26.224
Okay. I'll see you there.
Okay, bye.

08:26.399 --> 08:28.390
Now I gotta have a drink with her.

08:28.568 --> 08:30.365
The cabin.

08:31.138 --> 08:32.628
Well...

08:33.707 --> 08:36.073
Susan?

08:36.243 --> 08:38.643
- About the cabin...
- I love that place.

08:38.812 --> 08:42.407
My father built that cabin in 1947.

08:42.582 --> 08:45.983
My mother was recuperating
from impetigo at the time...

08:46.153 --> 08:49.987
...and Dad thought it would be a good
idea to get her out into the fresh air.

08:50.157 --> 08:51.852
She died there the following winter.

08:54.928 --> 08:57.158
And Dad passed away
10 years later to the day.

08:58.365 --> 09:00.833
His last words to me were:

09:01.368 --> 09:03.666
"Cherish the cabin."

09:07.240 --> 09:10.732
Not, "Take care of your sister."
She's a paraplegic.

09:12.345 --> 09:15.610
But, "Cherish the cabin."

09:15.782 --> 09:18.945
And I have, for 45 years.

09:19.286 --> 09:23.382
It's often been a sanctuary for me.

09:24.257 --> 09:26.953
Kind of like Superman's
Fortress of Solitude.

09:27.627 --> 09:29.288
What?

09:29.729 --> 09:31.253
Superman.

09:31.431 --> 09:34.366
He built a Fortress of Solitude
up at the North Pole...

09:34.534 --> 09:37.867
...to, you know, sort of
get away from it all.

09:38.471 --> 09:41.531
When I go, I'm passing it on to her.

09:41.708 --> 09:46.168
Well, I'll take a hotel any day.

09:46.346 --> 09:47.711
- Daddy?
- Yes.

09:47.881 --> 09:50.111
Daddy, about the cabin.

09:50.784 --> 09:54.345
Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me.

09:54.521 --> 09:57.388
- What about it?
- Well, the thing is...

09:57.557 --> 10:00.958
- What, what is it?
- Well, the cabin is kind of...

10:01.127 --> 10:03.789
- George?
- Burned.

10:05.799 --> 10:08.199
- Burned?
- There was a fire, and it...

10:08.368 --> 10:09.801
Burned.

10:10.837 --> 10:14.534
- The cabin burned?
- Yeah, burned.

10:14.708 --> 10:17.472
Burned?

10:17.644 --> 10:18.872
Was anything found?

10:19.045 --> 10:22.071
Was it all burned to the ground?
Did they find anything?

10:22.249 --> 10:24.911
- No. Nothing.
- Nothing?

10:27.120 --> 10:29.884
But, you know, Mr. Ross,
if you look at the whole situation...

10:30.056 --> 10:32.616
...what with it being your cigars
and everything...

10:32.792 --> 10:34.657
...it's really rather ironic.

10:34.828 --> 10:37.922
One might even say,
in a sense, comical.

10:40.267 --> 10:43.031
Really. Think about it.

10:43.203 --> 10:45.763
- I can't believe you said that.
- What?

10:45.939 --> 10:48.169
How could you say
something like that to me?

10:48.341 --> 10:50.775
What? You were the one
who was talking dirty.

10:50.944 --> 10:52.343
I was just trying to keep up.

10:52.512 --> 10:56.243
- That was a weird thing to say.
- Why? It didn't mean anything.

10:56.416 --> 10:58.941
I was trying to join in
so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.

10:59.119 --> 11:03.283
- Oh, I think you're really sick.
- I'm not sick.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.481
You said much sicker things
than me.

11:06.526 --> 11:08.517
- I'm leaving.
- You're making too much of this.

11:08.695 --> 11:09.923
Excuse me.

11:10.096 --> 11:12.087
- Let me walk you to a cab.
- That's okay.

11:12.265 --> 11:14.665
The main thing is that this is
just between us.

11:14.834 --> 11:17.598
- And that'll be the end of it.
- Oh, really?

11:17.771 --> 11:20.433
I mean, people, they're not interested
in things like this.

11:20.607 --> 11:23.098
They don't wanna hear about it.
They really don't.

11:26.913 --> 11:28.938
So we're drinking and talking.

11:29.115 --> 11:31.481
And so she starts rubbing my leg.

11:31.651 --> 11:34.586
Wow, what did you do?

11:34.754 --> 11:37.154
Have you ever told a woman
to stop touching your leg?

11:38.458 --> 11:40.722
- Yeah. Right.
- I know it's the wrong thing to do.

11:40.894 --> 11:44.193
She works in Elaine's office.
But I can't get that hand off my leg.

11:44.364 --> 11:47.731
I'm looking at the hand thinking,
"That hand should not be on my leg."

11:47.901 --> 11:51.632
But I can't make my brain to get
my mouth to say the words:

11:51.805 --> 11:53.272
"Would you mind?"

11:53.973 --> 11:57.272
Yet women have no problem getting
the hand off. How do they do that?

11:57.444 --> 11:59.935
I don't know. They're working
on a whole other level.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.943
- All right, so go ahead.
- So then we go back to my apartment.

12:06.286 --> 12:08.083
So we're fooling around there.

12:08.254 --> 12:10.245
You know, it's getting
a little passionate.

12:10.423 --> 12:13.620
And she starts with the dirty talking.

12:13.793 --> 12:16.455
All right, all right. Hold on.

12:16.629 --> 12:18.620
Time out.

12:20.367 --> 12:24.269
- What did she say?
- You know. The usual.

12:24.437 --> 12:26.462
No, I don't know.
How do I know the usual?

12:26.639 --> 12:29.733
- Typical things.
- What's typical? Give me typical.

12:31.745 --> 12:34.111
She says...

12:36.000 --> 12:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:48.828 --> 12:50.455
That's very dirty.

12:50.630 --> 12:53.463
That's absolutely filthy.

12:53.633 --> 12:55.828
And then she starts talking
about her panties.

12:56.102 --> 12:58.696
I'm gonna need some water here.

13:00.206 --> 13:01.798
So I said something.

13:02.142 --> 13:03.575
Okay, what did you say?

13:03.743 --> 13:06.735
Now, bear in mind,
I am just trying to keep up.

13:06.913 --> 13:09.040
- Of course.
- Okay.

13:09.215 --> 13:12.446
So she's talking about her panties.

13:12.619 --> 13:14.553
So...

13:15.388 --> 13:16.787
So I said:

13:16.956 --> 13:20.084
"You mean, the panties your mother
laid out for you."

13:32.639 --> 13:36.769
"The panties your mother
laid out for you"?

13:36.943 --> 13:39.411
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

13:41.281 --> 13:42.509
It just popped out.

13:42.682 --> 13:45.845
- Well, how did she react?
- She flipped out. Just left.

13:46.019 --> 13:47.452
Well, that's not offensive.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.986
It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.

13:50.156 --> 13:53.319
Look, the main thing is I don't want
Elaine to know about any of this.

13:53.493 --> 13:55.222
I mean, especially the pantie remark.

13:55.395 --> 13:58.296
I mean, it's embarrassing.
She'd never let me hear the end of it.

13:58.498 --> 14:00.125
What if this girl says something?

14:00.300 --> 14:01.892
She will. She's going back to work.

14:02.068 --> 14:04.628
I talked her into it.
How stupid was that.

14:05.271 --> 14:07.603
So Susan's father took that news
pretty hard, huh?

14:07.774 --> 14:10.402
Yeah. He went into the bedroom
and started sobbing.

14:10.577 --> 14:13.546
- Guess he didn't see the humor in it.
- Yeah.

14:16.115 --> 14:18.379
- Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.
- All right.

14:18.551 --> 14:20.781
- Big workday.
- That's right.

14:21.888 --> 14:23.116
- Okay.
- Let's go.

14:23.289 --> 14:24.517
- Right now.
- Let's do it.

14:24.691 --> 14:26.386
- Okay.
- All right.

14:26.993 --> 14:30.429
- What do you got?
- I got, you enter, you go, "Hi."

14:30.597 --> 14:32.497
And I go, "Hello."

14:33.800 --> 14:36.735
Now, we need something here.

14:37.737 --> 14:39.398
- Oh, hey.
- Kramer! Hey!

14:39.572 --> 14:41.972
- Buddy!
- You guys are working. I'll come back.

14:42.141 --> 14:43.540
- No, no! Come on.
- No, no!

14:43.743 --> 14:45.870
No, you guys should
get back to work.

14:46.045 --> 14:48.536
- Don't leave. We're taking a break.
- Oh, yeah?

14:48.715 --> 14:51.377
George, did you talk to that guy
about getting more cigars?

14:52.118 --> 14:53.710
I told you. I'm not gonna do that.

14:53.887 --> 14:56.048
Okay. Well...

14:56.222 --> 14:59.555
I guess I'm just gonna have to
take matters into my own hands, huh?

14:59.726 --> 15:01.250
All right. I'll see you guys.

15:01.427 --> 15:04.487
Where are you going?
Don't run off like that.

15:14.641 --> 15:16.336
Okay...

15:20.046 --> 15:22.981
- I need to talk to someone.
- Well, what is this about?

15:23.149 --> 15:25.709
Well, it's a very private matter,
but extremely urgent.

15:26.452 --> 15:28.647
- Are you an American?
- Oh, yeah.

15:28.821 --> 15:30.152
I see.

15:30.323 --> 15:32.188
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

15:36.829 --> 15:38.956
- Okay, let's get going.
- Let's get focused here.

15:39.132 --> 15:42.829
Come on, now.
Come on, let's get it together.

15:44.003 --> 15:45.334
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.

15:45.505 --> 15:47.336
Come on up.

15:50.176 --> 15:52.110
All right, you know what
we should do?

15:52.278 --> 15:54.405
We should go to the movies.

15:54.581 --> 15:56.776
- Get away from the script for a while.
- We should.

15:56.950 --> 16:00.442
I just have to go over to the Rosses'
and drop off Susan's sunglasses.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.850
- Come with me?
- Yeah. Does she live with them?

16:03.022 --> 16:04.250
No, no.

16:04.424 --> 16:08.485
- Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld.
- What?

16:09.228 --> 16:11.992
I just got a message from Sandra.
She's coming back to work.

16:12.298 --> 16:14.232
Well, then you've just gotta fire her.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.868
Don't even think about it.
There's no two ways about it.

16:17.236 --> 16:20.569
- Why, what happened? Did you talk?
- Talk? Did I talk? l...

16:20.740 --> 16:23.573
You're darn right I talked to her.
We talked up a storm.

16:23.743 --> 16:25.870
I've concluded,
from the basis the those talks...

16:26.045 --> 16:28.513
...that this isn't anybody
you should be talking to.

16:28.681 --> 16:31.047
- You really think I should fire her?
- Oh, yeah.

16:31.217 --> 16:35.347
In fact, if George and I weren't
so busy working, I'd do it myself.

16:47.734 --> 16:49.065
What is your name, señor?

16:49.235 --> 16:50.463
Kramer.

16:50.637 --> 16:53.663
So Señor Kramer,
what is this about?

16:55.308 --> 16:57.173
- Cigars.
- Cigars?

16:57.710 --> 17:00.178
- Cigars.
- What about cigars?

17:00.713 --> 17:02.442
See, here, l...

17:02.615 --> 17:04.810
I saved one of the cigar rings.

17:06.886 --> 17:10.481
- You mean, one of these.
- Yeah, yeah. That's them.

17:10.656 --> 17:14.457
Okay, so I'd like to buy
a couple of boxes of those from you.

17:14.627 --> 17:17.925
You realize, of course,
these are illegal in your country.

17:18.631 --> 17:20.428
Well, illegal, huh?

17:22.635 --> 17:26.332
I like that jacket.

17:34.914 --> 17:36.677
- Hi!
- Hi. How are you?

17:36.849 --> 17:38.111
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

17:38.284 --> 17:39.945
I thought you guys were
working today.

17:40.553 --> 17:42.350
- Just taking a little break.
- Yeah.

17:42.522 --> 17:45.514
- Oh, here's your sunglasses.
- Oh, thanks. Come on in for a second.

17:45.858 --> 17:49.021
This is my brother Ricky. He's home
from college for the weekend.

17:49.195 --> 17:51.163
Hey, there, young fella.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.195
- What's your major?
- I don't have one.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.631
Well, you should always
consider podiatry.

17:56.002 --> 17:57.560
Nothing wrong with the feet.

17:57.737 --> 17:59.295
And this is my aunt, Sara.

18:00.773 --> 18:02.536
He doesn't look like me.

18:04.277 --> 18:06.472
Sara, what do you have
on your wheels?

18:06.646 --> 18:08.511
Nothing. They're clean.

18:08.681 --> 18:10.410
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?

18:10.583 --> 18:14.019
- Yes.
- Well, they're filthy.

18:15.188 --> 18:18.021
It's just a matter
of common courtesy.

18:19.292 --> 18:23.126
You come in the house,
you wipe your wheels.

18:24.230 --> 18:26.095
Excuse me.

18:26.666 --> 18:27.894
Hello, Raymond.

18:28.067 --> 18:30.365
The man from the insurance company
dropped this off.

18:30.536 --> 18:33.232
Said it was the only thing left
from the remains of the fire.

18:33.406 --> 18:35.340
Oh, thank you.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.502
Wow, I've never seen this before.

18:38.678 --> 18:39.940
Oh, they're letters.

18:40.313 --> 18:42.543
- Here.
- Oh, sure.

18:43.116 --> 18:47.815
From... From John Cheever!

18:51.190 --> 18:52.714
"Dear Henry...

18:52.892 --> 18:55.622
...last night with you was bliss.

18:55.795 --> 18:57.763
I fear my...

18:58.765 --> 19:02.531
...orgasm has left me a cripple.

19:02.702 --> 19:06.229
I don't know how I shall ever
get back to work.

19:06.405 --> 19:09.806
I love you madly, John.

19:10.343 --> 19:13.369
P.S. Loved the cabin."

19:17.550 --> 19:20.917
- Well, we really should be...
- Yeah, look at the time.

19:21.087 --> 19:23.681
...heading out.
You know, it's a time...

19:23.856 --> 19:25.483
The box!

19:25.658 --> 19:27.182
My letters! Give me that!

19:28.795 --> 19:30.023
Who told you to open it?

19:30.196 --> 19:31.561
Who's John? Who's John?!

19:31.731 --> 19:33.631
- I knew it.
- I wanna know who John is!

19:33.800 --> 19:36.064
John Cheever? Dad!
You and John Cheever?

19:36.235 --> 19:40.137
Yes. Yes, he was the most
wonderful person I've ever known.

19:40.873 --> 19:42.704
And I loved him deeply.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.569
In a way you could
never understand.

19:53.119 --> 19:55.917
Well, we really should be
heading out.

19:56.088 --> 19:58.113
Jerry hates to miss
the coming attractions.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.350
- Yeah, and because of the time.
- Yeah.

20:00.526 --> 20:03.689
Time is what he's indicating there.

20:03.863 --> 20:07.629
Anyway, onward and upward.

20:10.736 --> 20:11.964
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

20:12.138 --> 20:13.503
- Come on, now.
- Right now.

20:13.673 --> 20:15.607
- You and me. No fooling.
- You got it.

20:15.775 --> 20:18.710
- All right, what do you got?
- I got, you come in, you say, "Hi."

20:18.878 --> 20:21.278
And then I say, "Hello."

20:22.615 --> 20:24.515
- All right. So we need something.
- Yeah.

20:25.484 --> 20:28.214
How about this:
I say, "How's it going?"

20:29.422 --> 20:32.357
"How's it going?" Beautiful.

20:33.092 --> 20:35.390
- Come on. We were just on a roll now.
- All right.

20:35.561 --> 20:37.392
- Did you get that line?
- "How's it going?"

20:37.563 --> 20:40.430
- Did you write it down?
- I'm writing it. "How's it going?"

20:41.300 --> 20:42.961
- Real good!
- What?

20:43.302 --> 20:46.465
You know how much money
you cost me today? $429.

20:46.639 --> 20:49.107
- What, how?
- I got Sandra transferred...

20:49.275 --> 20:51.038
...to another office upstairs, okay.

20:51.210 --> 20:54.270
So she blabs to Lippman about
my long-distance calls to Europe!

20:54.447 --> 20:57.814
- What calls?
- I made a friend when I was in Europe.

20:57.984 --> 21:01.147
And we've been in touch,
and Sandra told Lippman!

21:01.420 --> 21:03.615
Did she say anything else to you?

21:04.490 --> 21:06.685
Anything else? What do you mean,
"anything else"?

21:06.959 --> 21:08.654
So she just left the office...

21:08.828 --> 21:11.661
...didn't say a word to you
about anything?

21:11.998 --> 21:15.399
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

21:16.535 --> 21:18.230
Why is that beautiful?

21:18.404 --> 21:19.894
Oh, no. Not beautiful.

21:20.072 --> 21:21.733
It's $429!

21:21.908 --> 21:23.842
Hey, look, I'm gonna pay for that.

21:24.010 --> 21:26.535
- No, no.
- No, I insist.

21:26.712 --> 21:28.942
I was the one that encouraged you
to fire her.

21:29.115 --> 21:30.844
- The whole thing was all my...
- Okay.

21:31.017 --> 21:32.575
Fault.

21:32.752 --> 21:34.845
Do you smell smoke?

21:38.891 --> 21:41.689
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you
to meet my new friends here.

21:41.861 --> 21:44.694
This is Luis, Jorge and Umberto.

21:44.864 --> 21:47.059
- Hey.
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.

21:47.233 --> 21:49.963
Yeah, we're heading up
to Westchester. Gonna hit the links.

21:50.136 --> 21:52.832
- Yeah.
- Hey, isn't that your...?

21:53.005 --> 21:54.939
Oh, yeah. Okay. We're going.
All right.

22:03.115 --> 22:04.343
Hey, what are you reading?

22:04.850 --> 22:08.081
The Falconer, by John Cheever.
It's really excellent.

22:08.788 --> 22:11.416
John Cheever. You ever read
any of his stuff?

22:11.590 --> 22:15.082
Yeah, I'm familiar with
some of his writing. You know.

22:17.530 --> 22:20.363
Look, we gotta get back to work.
We just had a big breakthrough.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.364
- Okay. I'll leave you two alone.
- Okay.

22:22.535 --> 22:23.763
Maybe I'll visit my mother.

22:23.936 --> 22:28.532
She just bought me some new panties,
and they're all laid out for me.

22:42.722 --> 22:45.213
There's this whole
talking-during-sex business.

22:45.391 --> 22:47.052
I mean, what are we doing here?

22:47.259 --> 22:48.988
The question is...

22:49.161 --> 22:51.356
...does the talking really
improve the sex?

22:51.530 --> 22:53.020
Or is the sex act now...

22:53.199 --> 22:55.599
...just there to spice up
the conversation?

22:55.835 --> 22:59.236
Eventually, I'm sure people will get
too lazy even for phone sex.

22:59.405 --> 23:02.135
They'll start having
phone machine sex.

23:02.541 --> 23:06.341
"Yeah, I want you really bad.
Just leave it on the tape."

23:07.913 --> 23:10.848
Then, I guess, the phone company
will come out with sex-waiting.

23:11.017 --> 23:12.882
That'll be the new thing.

23:13.052 --> 23:15.077
"Yeah, hold on, honey.
I got another call.

23:15.254 --> 23:16.551
Oh, hi, baby. One second.

23:16.722 --> 23:19.555
Honey, I've gotta take this.

23:19.725 --> 23:21.784
Yeah, I've got sex-waiting
on the other line...

23:21.961 --> 23:24.054
...and I've got to take this."
