WEBVTT

00:03.847 --> 00:05.906
Hey, Baxter. Oh.

00:05.908 --> 00:07.699
Uh, yeah, I won't bother
you if you're busy.

00:07.701 --> 00:09.701
Oh, you're not bothering
me. Come on in. What's up?

00:11.847 --> 00:13.638
Is this a trap?

00:13.640 --> 00:16.656
Is a bucket of water gonna
fall on my head or something?

00:16.658 --> 00:19.659
No, no, no. I mean, you bother me a lot,

00:19.661 --> 00:20.795
but not today.

00:20.797 --> 00:22.330
As a matter of fact, for
the next couple weeks,

00:22.332 --> 00:24.998
it's happy Mike Baxter.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.554
Oh, that's right, it's
bass festival season.

00:28.556 --> 00:31.861
It's Big Ass Bass Festival.

00:31.863 --> 00:33.363
Show a little respect, you know.

00:33.365 --> 00:34.765
Christmastime can suck it.

00:34.767 --> 00:36.232
This is the most
wonderful time of the year.

00:36.234 --> 00:37.434
Yeah.

00:37.436 --> 00:39.202
You know, I actually can't wait.

00:39.204 --> 00:42.073
- I-I heard there's gonna be a beer garden this year.
- Yeah.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.674
It's gonna make the three-legged race

00:43.676 --> 00:45.675
a lot more fun to watch.

00:45.677 --> 00:48.395
And the lawn dart game.
I'll tell you what, huh?

00:48.397 --> 00:50.954
It's the 25th anniversary
of Ed and I doing this,

00:50.956 --> 00:52.048
so I'm pulling out all the stops.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.117
Yeah, I bet Ed has some
crazy ideas cooked up, too.

00:54.119 --> 00:55.418
Ed always has crazy ideas,

00:55.420 --> 00:57.787
but this time of year,
they work in perfectly.

00:57.789 --> 01:00.458
Nothing can beat what he did
for the grand finale last year.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.792
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01.794 --> 01:04.795
Fireworks and a
performance by Air Supply.

01:04.797 --> 01:07.798
That's because Toto wasn't available.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.066
Yeah.

01:09.068 --> 01:10.468
Ironically, they were in Africa.

01:11.970 --> 01:14.771
Oh, I love that band.
I'm a total Toto-head.

01:14.773 --> 01:16.272
We were just talking about the festival,

01:16.274 --> 01:18.160
and we're both excited
about what your big surprise

01:18.162 --> 01:20.211
- is gonna be this time.
- It's bad news, Mikey.

01:20.213 --> 01:21.378
- Yeah?
- Yep.

01:21.380 --> 01:22.947
You're gonna have to host
the festival without me.

01:22.949 --> 01:24.548
I'm out.

01:24.550 --> 01:27.087
Yeah. You know, your surprises aren't

01:27.089 --> 01:29.652
quite as fun as they used to be.

01:36.496 --> 01:38.394
All right, look, I'm not buying this.

01:38.396 --> 01:39.830
You're not coming to the festival?

01:39.832 --> 01:42.066
Yeah, yeah, Ed, I mean, who's
gonna pour the Bass-tinis?

01:42.068 --> 01:44.001
Yeah.

01:44.003 --> 01:47.471
Pond. James Pond.

01:47.473 --> 01:50.107
Netted, not stirred.

01:50.109 --> 01:52.610
I'm serious. I'm gonna
be away that weekend

01:52.612 --> 01:54.310
with my lovely bride.

01:54.312 --> 01:56.946
Aw, what can I say? We're newlyweds.

01:56.948 --> 01:58.516
We're joined at the arthritic hips.

02:00.485 --> 02:02.534
Okay, well, you have a
wonderful day at work, my love.

02:02.536 --> 02:03.754
- Mmm...
- Okay.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.488
It won't be wonderful
until I get back home

02:05.490 --> 02:06.523
to see you, my dear.

02:06.525 --> 02:08.158
- Oh... ta!
- See you later, Bonnie.

02:08.161 --> 02:09.759
Love your lovin'.

02:09.762 --> 02:11.161
What do you mean you're
not coming to the festival?

02:11.163 --> 02:13.696
- What's the matter with you?
- Yeah, Ed.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.465
We all love our wives, but what could be

02:15.467 --> 02:16.700
more important than the festival?

02:16.702 --> 02:18.101
Bonnie wants me to accompany her

02:18.103 --> 02:21.838
to the Bessler Art Museum
Annual Gala in Connecticut.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.975
Oh, the Bessler Art Gallery?
Why didn't you say something?

02:24.977 --> 02:26.177
You hate art.

02:26.179 --> 02:28.045
Now, come on now, easy, easy, now.

02:28.047 --> 02:29.380
Art is very important to Bonnie.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.047
Well, art's very important
here in Colorado,

02:31.049 --> 02:33.311
- and bass fishing's like fine art.
- Yeah.

02:33.313 --> 02:35.319
I once caught a fish by the nuke plant,

02:35.321 --> 02:38.154
looked like a Picasso painting.

02:38.156 --> 02:40.057
Three eyes, gills on top of its head,

02:40.059 --> 02:41.193
and a thumb.

02:42.794 --> 02:44.030
And you ate it.

02:45.153 --> 02:47.710
See, I'm-I'm gonna hate
missing our festival,

02:47.712 --> 02:49.967
but this is the kind of
choice that I didn't make

02:49.969 --> 02:51.302
with my other marriages,

02:51.304 --> 02:53.170
and you know how well they turned out.

02:53.172 --> 02:55.039
All right. Can't argue with that.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.207
- Thanks for understanding.
- Mm.

02:57.209 --> 02:59.475
And when Air Supply gets
here, have them dedicate

02:59.477 --> 03:02.178
"Lost in Love" for Ed.

03:02.180 --> 03:04.049
That's my jam.

03:05.217 --> 03:07.684
What do you mean "you
can't argue with that"?

03:07.686 --> 03:09.886
You'll fight anything.

03:09.888 --> 03:11.054
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.

03:11.056 --> 03:12.690
- No, I won't.
- I know what you're doing.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.724
No, you don't.

03:13.726 --> 03:14.924
No, you don't, no, you don't,

03:14.926 --> 03:16.694
but thanks for helping me warm up.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.331
'Cause, yes, I will fight this.

03:21.699 --> 03:24.891
I am so excited I get to run
the Kids' Corral this year.

03:24.893 --> 03:27.104
Well, you're about to find out
that setting up fun and games

03:27.106 --> 03:29.606
is not all fun and games.

03:29.608 --> 03:31.507
Yes, but, um, it doesn't matter

03:31.509 --> 03:33.293
because I am doing this for you.

03:33.295 --> 03:34.744
You've got my goddaughter in there,

03:34.746 --> 03:37.947
so I want you to go rest
before the big kapow!

03:37.949 --> 03:41.851
Yes, because birth is just
like Batman punching the Joker.

03:41.853 --> 03:44.355
Okay, Goldfish Pond.

03:44.357 --> 03:47.090
You're gonna have to buy lots
of live goldfish for prizes.

03:47.092 --> 03:50.393
Don't be like Eve.
Remember to feed them.

03:50.395 --> 03:52.296
Next, corn dogs.

03:52.298 --> 03:55.531
Don't be like Eve.
Remember to cook them.

03:55.533 --> 03:57.201
Are you paying attention?

03:57.203 --> 03:59.737
Yes, cook the goldfish and
put fish food on the corn dogs.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.138
Mandy?

04:01.140 --> 04:03.374
I am kidding. Look, I have got this.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.726
I don't want you to give
this another thought.

04:04.728 --> 04:06.076
- Now go home and rest.
- Okay.

04:06.078 --> 04:08.879
Last thing. Face painting.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.215
It is the most popular booth
and the reason that you will hate

04:11.217 --> 04:14.384
children's cheeks for
the rest of your life.

04:14.386 --> 04:16.653
I know. It's so hard
to find a face painter.

04:16.654 --> 04:18.422
Oh, no, they're easy to find.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.922
They're usually in their car smoking pot

04:19.923 --> 04:21.958
while they should be painting faces.

04:21.959 --> 04:26.465
Well, Kris, I am way ahead of you. Jen!

04:32.672 --> 04:34.838
What do you think?

04:34.840 --> 04:37.174
Ah, that's amazing. He
looks just like a tiger.

04:37.176 --> 04:38.641
Oh, yeah, I feel like a tiger.

04:38.643 --> 04:39.977
I should be in a cage,

04:39.979 --> 04:42.946
just pacing back and forth.

04:42.948 --> 04:46.749
It's great, uh, but how
long did that take you, Jen?

04:46.751 --> 04:49.520
I got it down to two and a half hours.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.821
That's not gonna work.

04:51.823 --> 04:53.157
You're gonna have to paint a face

04:53.159 --> 04:54.258
every three or four minutes.

04:54.260 --> 04:55.958
Oh, like an assembly line?

04:55.960 --> 04:58.198
- Exactly.
- I quit!

04:59.931 --> 05:01.699
I am an artist.

05:01.701 --> 05:04.436
You should hire gang
members to tag the children.

05:06.972 --> 05:09.639
Okay, I will find someone.

05:09.641 --> 05:11.674
This is not your
problem, so you go home.

05:11.676 --> 05:13.210
- I've got this.
- Okay, okay.

05:13.212 --> 05:16.716
- But if you need anything...
- I won't. Go home.

05:17.883 --> 05:19.783
Okay, I am getting a
little scared, Kyle.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.651
Relax.

05:21.653 --> 05:24.454
I'm not gonna maul you.

05:24.456 --> 05:27.559
Although I could tear the
ass off an antelope right now.

05:31.864 --> 05:34.230
Hey, is that my favorite bottle of wine?

05:34.232 --> 05:36.566
I knew I liked you.

05:36.568 --> 05:38.001
Yeah.

05:38.003 --> 05:40.069
It's also your mother's
favorite bottle of wine,

05:40.071 --> 05:43.463
so hands off of that.

05:43.465 --> 05:44.540
Still like me?

05:44.542 --> 05:47.143
No. Now I'm on the fence.

05:47.145 --> 05:49.213
So, why are you giving her this gift?

05:49.215 --> 05:51.181
What, uh... what do you want from her?

05:51.183 --> 05:53.751
Maybe I just want her to know
how much she means to me.

05:53.753 --> 05:57.388
Uh-huh. What do you want from her?

05:57.390 --> 06:00.557
She's taking Ed to some
gallery opening in Connecticut

06:00.559 --> 06:02.259
the same weekend as the bass festival.

06:02.261 --> 06:04.216
Oh, yeah, yeah, the Bessler Museum.

06:04.218 --> 06:05.429
Yeah, she goes every year.

06:05.431 --> 06:08.564
Look, galas are kind
of her natural habitat.

06:08.566 --> 06:10.900
Well, that's great for
her, but she's making Ed go?

06:10.902 --> 06:13.381
- She's making him?
- Yeah.

06:13.383 --> 06:14.871
She's made him love her so much

06:14.873 --> 06:16.105
that he thinks he actually wants to go.

06:16.107 --> 06:18.275
It's, like, diabolical.

06:18.277 --> 06:21.278
And the bottle of wine is
supposed to convince her

06:21.280 --> 06:23.347
- that they should stay here instead?
- Exactly.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.581
Right. And you really think
you can convince my mother

06:25.583 --> 06:28.285
to give up Monet and
champagne for a... for an event

06:28.287 --> 06:31.355
that includes a worm race?

06:31.357 --> 06:32.855
We don't do the worm race anymore.

06:32.857 --> 06:35.961
I had to shut it down.
The mob got involved.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.228
You don't think I can pull this off?

06:39.230 --> 06:41.598
I think she will see right through it.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.400
Look, honey, you don't need the wine.

06:43.402 --> 06:44.667
You're-you're a salesman.

06:44.669 --> 06:47.537
Just-just sell her on the,
the importance of the festival.

06:47.539 --> 06:48.939
You really think I can do this,

06:48.941 --> 06:51.244
or do you just want that bottle of wine?

06:53.612 --> 06:55.815
Honey, honey, I believe in you.

06:55.817 --> 06:56.838
Yeah.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.109
And I don't need the bag.

07:06.592 --> 07:10.326
Hey. You wanted to see me, Mike?

07:10.328 --> 07:11.828
My favorite mother-in-law.

07:11.830 --> 07:13.997
Oh, darling. My favorite son-in-law.

07:13.999 --> 07:16.333
And don't tell Vanessa's sister

07:16.335 --> 07:17.837
or that idiot husband of hers.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.638
Mum is the word, Mum.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.239
Why don't you have a
seat? You know Chuck.

07:23.241 --> 07:25.772
- Oh, Chuck, hi.
- Yeah. Nice to see you, Bonnie.

07:25.774 --> 07:28.029
Although I must say I
miss seeing you with Ed,

07:28.031 --> 07:29.780
you crazy lovebirds.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.848
No, you don't.

07:31.850 --> 07:33.150
No, I don't.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.650
I didn't think so.

07:34.652 --> 07:37.588
- So, what's going on here?
- Okay.

07:37.590 --> 07:39.922
Well, we're doing our
final push for promotion

07:39.924 --> 07:41.764
for our Big Ass Bass Festival.

07:41.766 --> 07:43.116
Oh, what a charming name.

07:43.118 --> 07:46.971
Oh, uh, would you like a T-shirt?

07:46.973 --> 07:49.799
Uh, I really wouldn't, thank you.

07:49.801 --> 07:52.602
Okay, so here's what's going
on. Our radio sponsors are gonna

07:52.604 --> 07:55.605
have us on the air to
reach out to people...

07:55.607 --> 07:56.773
that really don't understand

07:56.775 --> 07:58.674
what the B.A.B. Festival is all about.

07:58.676 --> 08:00.143
Oh, that stands for Big Ass...

08:00.145 --> 08:03.013
I was able to break the code...

08:03.015 --> 08:04.948
You know, they may know the-the event,

08:04.950 --> 08:06.716
but they don't know the
history of the event, right?

08:06.718 --> 08:08.852
People like you, Bonnie.
People who are new to Colorado.

08:08.854 --> 08:10.288
Right, right, so, would you mind

08:10.290 --> 08:11.521
if we bounced a few ideas off you?

08:11.523 --> 08:12.723
No, not at all. I'm not...

08:12.725 --> 08:15.725
I'm not sure that I'm
exactly the target, uh,

08:15.727 --> 08:18.362
Fat Ass Bass, uh, audience...

08:20.633 --> 08:22.466
Big Ass Bass.

08:22.468 --> 08:27.069
Oh, Big. I stand corrected.
Forgive me, forgive me.

08:27.071 --> 08:30.406
All right, I am, I am all
ready for the history lesson.

08:30.408 --> 08:32.775
You know, this is...
this is kind of like

08:32.777 --> 08:33.909
listening to public radio.

08:33.912 --> 08:36.380
No, no, it's not like public radio. No.

08:36.381 --> 08:40.357
It's a totally... no. Hell no! No.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.816
- All right, give it a shot.
- Okay, here we go.

08:42.818 --> 08:44.755
25 years ago,

08:44.757 --> 08:49.095
Mike Baxter and Ed Alzate had a dream.

08:50.896 --> 08:53.829
To create a festival
that would bring together

08:53.831 --> 08:57.333
their two great loves:
fishing and the family

08:57.335 --> 09:00.270
they were building at Outdoor Man.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.738
This is the story of that journey.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.607
This is the story of

09:04.609 --> 09:09.545
the Big Ass Bass Festival.

09:09.547 --> 09:10.948
Yeah.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.083
Man, are-are you hooked?

09:13.085 --> 09:15.419
That's actually funny. Are you hooked?

09:15.421 --> 09:17.753
- I'm on the edge of my seat.
- Right.

09:17.755 --> 09:19.389
But th-the history is
even more interesting

09:19.391 --> 09:21.391
'cause it started with
just me and Ed and my family

09:21.393 --> 09:22.626
sitting on a cooler of beer

09:22.628 --> 09:24.761
with other customers of the
store that liked to fish.

09:24.763 --> 09:26.929
- And-and this year we're drawing thousands.
- Right.

09:26.931 --> 09:28.531
And we'll raise more than 200 grand

09:28.533 --> 09:30.467
- for the Children's Hospital.
- We hope. 200 grand.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.368
Oh, wow. I'm certainly reeled in.

09:32.370 --> 09:33.937
Reeled in. Get it?

09:33.939 --> 09:38.034
Yeah, I do, and that was magnificent.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.376
And next year the festival
will be even bigger.

09:40.378 --> 09:43.713
But the reality is... without Ed here,

09:43.715 --> 09:46.282
it's gonna just, uh, feel smaller.

09:46.284 --> 09:49.151
I see.

09:49.153 --> 09:52.622
Well, Mike, I know why
you're sharing this with me,

09:52.624 --> 09:55.424
and you've... you've given
me something to think about.

09:55.426 --> 09:57.493
Bonnie, that's all I
wanted to do is just kind of

09:57.495 --> 09:59.829
open your mind a-a smidge
just to th-the world

09:59.831 --> 10:00.963
we live in around here.

10:00.965 --> 10:03.165
Uh, a new and exciting world.

10:03.167 --> 10:07.072
The world of Big Ass Bass.

10:09.074 --> 10:13.109
Chuck, you should do
voices for animated films.

10:13.111 --> 10:14.477
Shouldn't he? Shouldn't he, Mike?

10:14.479 --> 10:16.979
You know, Bonnie, I've heard better.

10:20.518 --> 10:22.519
Hello? Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

10:22.521 --> 10:24.920
I have been calling around to
try and find some ponies to rent,

10:24.922 --> 10:26.490
but no one seems to have any.

10:26.492 --> 10:29.596
Can you please explain the
great pony shortage of 2020?

10:31.196 --> 10:34.968
Oh, I'm sorry, then don't
call yourself a pet shop!

10:36.134 --> 10:39.001
Okay, Mandy, we're ready.

10:39.003 --> 10:41.170
Okay, not-not yet.

10:41.172 --> 10:43.439
Not yet.

10:43.441 --> 10:46.446
And done. Four minutes flat.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.284
Is she a bunny?

10:54.286 --> 10:57.386
Or a kitty or a dog

10:57.388 --> 11:01.157
or anything in the
animal kingdom, really.

11:01.159 --> 11:02.192
What do you think?

11:02.194 --> 11:05.161
Well, she looks like she did it herself.

11:05.163 --> 11:07.497
In the dark.

11:07.499 --> 11:09.534
With her foot.

11:12.537 --> 11:14.637
Well, it's kind of her own fault.

11:14.639 --> 11:16.508
She doesn't have any
natural bunny features.

11:18.476 --> 11:20.577
Okay, I know I quit
being the face painter,

11:20.579 --> 11:23.816
but now I'd like to withdraw my face.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.049
Hey, everybody. Brought
over the tickets.

11:27.051 --> 11:30.152
And my special agave
syrup for the snow cones.

11:30.154 --> 11:31.320
Snow cones?

11:31.322 --> 11:33.656
You did rent the machine, didn't you?

11:33.658 --> 11:36.025
Uh, Ryan, of course she did.

11:36.027 --> 11:38.160
How much of an idiot
do you think she is?

11:38.162 --> 11:41.030
Yeah, come on, man.

11:41.032 --> 11:44.501
Good God.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.502
That's not what the face painting's

11:46.504 --> 11:48.070
- gonna look like, right?
- Right.

11:48.072 --> 11:50.240
We're not even sure what
that's supposed to be.

11:50.242 --> 11:52.078
Yeah, come on, man.

11:53.378 --> 11:55.779
Shouldn't you go back to
your wife? I mean, how is she?

11:55.781 --> 11:57.881
Uh, her back hurts,
her feet are swollen,

11:57.883 --> 11:59.549
and, "Those aren't the
chocolate chip cookies

11:59.551 --> 12:02.021
I wanted, go back and
get me the right ones".

12:03.788 --> 12:07.623
So, uh, yeah. She's great.

12:07.625 --> 12:11.562
Well, you go ahead and tell her
that I am way ahead of schedule

12:11.564 --> 12:12.796
and not to worry.

12:12.798 --> 12:15.535
Uh, yeah, she's not really
liking me talking right now.

12:17.869 --> 12:20.871
- Can you believe that guy?
- Yes. It's like he's reading my mind.

12:20.873 --> 12:24.274
Everything is going wrong.
I'm terrible at this.

12:24.276 --> 12:26.912
Do you want me to paint
a smile on your face?

12:28.479 --> 12:31.580
Kyle? What kind of makeup is this?

12:31.582 --> 12:33.617
Uh, it's whatever they
had at the Dollar Mart.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.221
It's not coming off and it burns.

12:37.455 --> 12:40.292
- It was a dollar.
- Oh, my God.

12:48.432 --> 12:50.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:50.002 --> 12:51.734
You know, when we started
doing this festival,

12:51.736 --> 12:52.902
this thing was a guppy.

12:54.672 --> 12:56.338
Ooh, honey, are you feeling okay?

12:56.340 --> 12:59.642
'Cause you look like you
might have a haddock.

12:59.644 --> 13:01.745
I do now.

13:01.747 --> 13:04.981
Hey, everybody. The boss is here.

13:04.983 --> 13:06.683
- Look busy. Look busy.
- Wait a minute.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.584
Does this mean you're back?

13:08.586 --> 13:11.621
You bet. I'm ready to
pound beers or nails.

13:11.623 --> 13:12.689
Used to do both.

13:12.691 --> 13:15.458
Until this little piggy
went to the hospital.

13:15.460 --> 13:19.335
Ooh. Ha-ha. Wow, you
convinced my mother to stay.

13:19.337 --> 13:20.697
You really are a good salesman.

13:20.699 --> 13:23.766
It goes without saying, but,
uh, thanks for saying it.

13:23.768 --> 13:25.602
Well, it's not quite, Mikey.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.304
See, Bonnie is still going to the gala,

13:27.306 --> 13:28.972
but she knew it was
very important for me

13:28.974 --> 13:30.506
to be here with my Outdoor Man family.

13:30.508 --> 13:32.843
Oh? She really must love you.

13:32.845 --> 13:35.545
How diabolical.

13:35.547 --> 13:37.546
She convinced me that our young marriage

13:37.548 --> 13:39.649
can endure a brief separation.

13:39.651 --> 13:41.541
Okay, well, whatever
you guys decide is fine.

13:41.543 --> 13:42.852
So I'll get you a hammer and a beer.

13:42.854 --> 13:44.286
Yeah, just one little thing

13:44.288 --> 13:45.722
that you can do for me, Mikey, please.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.357
- Just name it.
- Yeah?

13:47.359 --> 13:50.227
Convince my wife to stay.

13:50.229 --> 13:53.532
I can't be apart from her. Okay?

14:02.574 --> 14:04.140
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man,

14:04.142 --> 14:06.809
talking about, well, Outdoor Man.

14:06.811 --> 14:08.844
When this store opened
almost 30 years ago,

14:08.846 --> 14:11.747
it was just a simple
bait and tackle shop.

14:11.749 --> 14:14.217
I was just a simple marketing director

14:14.219 --> 14:17.053
with rugged good looks.

14:17.055 --> 14:20.490
This was a time when
we all had great hair.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.258
I invited hunters to the store;

14:22.260 --> 14:24.895
they'd say, "Hey, you
only have fish stuff".

14:24.897 --> 14:27.564
And then the mullet was king.

14:27.566 --> 14:28.955
I'd say, "Thanks, but come in.

14:28.957 --> 14:30.567
We've got something for everyone here".

14:30.569 --> 14:32.669
When they did, they
found hunting jackets,

14:32.671 --> 14:34.871
field gutting gloves,
and T-shirts that read,

14:34.873 --> 14:37.741
"Hunters Do It in the Woods".

14:37.743 --> 14:41.210
When they saw camo and
ammo, the hunters smiled.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.514
When I invited campers
to the store, they'd say,

14:44.516 --> 14:47.349
"Nah, you just have
fishing and hunting stuff".

14:47.351 --> 14:50.587
At that time the rattail was king.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.454
I'd say, "Thanks, but come on by,

14:52.456 --> 14:54.189
we've got something for everyone".

14:54.191 --> 14:57.426
When they did, they saw tents,
sleeping bags, and T-shirts

14:57.428 --> 15:01.197
that read, "Campers Do It in the Woods".

15:01.199 --> 15:04.367
Oddly enough, they in fact do.

15:04.369 --> 15:07.036
Outdoor Man thrives on variety.

15:07.038 --> 15:08.804
When I invited mountain-climbing vegans,

15:08.806 --> 15:12.442
I'd say, "We have boots
made of fake leather".

15:12.444 --> 15:15.812
And now the man bun is king.

15:15.814 --> 15:17.560
Outdoor Man is more than a store;

15:17.562 --> 15:18.714
Outdoor Man is a family.

15:18.716 --> 15:20.717
And families welcome all types of people

15:20.719 --> 15:22.484
with all kinds of hairdos.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.920
So I invite everyone to
come by our 25th Annual

15:24.922 --> 15:27.891
Big Bass Festival and meet our family.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.659
You might just find you're one of us.

15:29.661 --> 15:31.394
My buddy Terry Bradshaw will be there.

15:31.396 --> 15:34.535
He's had the same hairstyle since 1975.

15:37.268 --> 15:40.472
Chrome-Dome Baxter out.

15:43.341 --> 15:45.141
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:45.143 --> 15:47.810
Hi, you are supposed to
be at home taking it easy.

15:47.812 --> 15:49.913
Well, when Ryan was
here, he got the idea

15:49.915 --> 15:51.448
that things weren't going so great.

15:51.450 --> 15:55.352
What? No, I am killing it.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.820
So, Ryan was wrong.

15:57.822 --> 15:59.689
Just like he was wrong
about the cookies.

15:59.691 --> 16:02.592
Stupid Ryan!

16:02.594 --> 16:04.460
Are these so hard to find?

16:04.462 --> 16:05.828
Okay.

16:05.830 --> 16:08.264
Well, you sound disappointed
that things are going well.

16:08.266 --> 16:09.466
I find that odd.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.101
No, it's nothing. It's just...

16:11.103 --> 16:12.835
I don't want to tell you

16:12.837 --> 16:15.137
because it makes me sound
like a terrible person.

16:15.139 --> 16:18.343
Okay, well, now I must know.

16:19.378 --> 16:20.944
I've just been sitting at home,

16:20.946 --> 16:22.545
feeling swollen and uncomfortable

16:22.547 --> 16:24.481
and totally useless,

16:24.483 --> 16:27.950
and I thought if you were struggling,

16:27.952 --> 16:31.654
then I could, you know,
step in and feel needed.

16:31.656 --> 16:34.524
Okay. Well, good news:

16:34.526 --> 16:37.496
I am totally blowing it.

16:40.465 --> 16:42.531
Don't toy with me, Mandy.

16:42.533 --> 16:44.000
I'm fragile.

16:44.002 --> 16:46.402
No, no, seriously, okay? Look at this.

16:46.404 --> 16:48.971
No ponies, no face
painter, I got nothing.

16:48.973 --> 16:51.309
I was this close to
starting a fight club.

16:53.478 --> 16:55.545
Look, let's-let's face it, okay?

16:55.547 --> 16:57.980
I am not the amazing you.

16:57.982 --> 17:00.083
I haven't always been
the amazing me, either.

17:00.085 --> 17:01.683
What do you mean?

17:01.685 --> 17:04.347
Dad threatened to fire me
for the first couple of years.

17:04.348 --> 17:05.721
There were runaway ponies

17:05.723 --> 17:07.923
and dart injuries and...

17:07.925 --> 17:09.992
one year I forgot to rent
the snow cone machine.

17:09.994 --> 17:11.994
Come on, man.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.663
And there was a clown who...

17:14.665 --> 17:16.498
well, legally, he
should have notified us

17:16.500 --> 17:18.537
when he moved into the neighborhood.

17:19.837 --> 17:23.560
Okay, so... what do I do now?

17:23.563 --> 17:25.941
Well, we sit down and we work through

17:25.943 --> 17:27.109
all of this together.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.530
- Like sisters.
- Thank you, sister.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.916
But, um, next year, I suggest
that you get pregnant

17:32.918 --> 17:34.450
and we pawn it off on Eve.

17:34.452 --> 17:36.955
Interesting.

17:39.221 --> 17:41.578
Hey, there.

17:41.580 --> 17:42.968
Listen, if you're looking
for the good stuff,

17:42.970 --> 17:45.327
it's marked in the bottle
"Not for you, Chuck".

17:45.329 --> 17:49.099
Just about to pour myself a Manhattan.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.101
- Join me.
- Yeah, just a little one.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.396
Okay. A splash. Here you go.

17:53.398 --> 17:55.537
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:55.539 --> 17:59.042
- So, um, Ed said he's staying for the festival.
- Yeah.

17:59.044 --> 18:00.743
I was hoping, uh, you would, too.

18:00.745 --> 18:02.812
Aw. That's very kind of you,

18:02.814 --> 18:07.585
but, um, big butt fish festivals
are not my cup of tea.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.878
That's what I used to say
about in-laws, until I met you.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.156
- Oh.
- Not the, the big butt part, that was...

18:14.893 --> 18:17.127
So you must really love
that gala in Connecticut.

18:17.129 --> 18:20.563
Oh, I wouldn't say love. I just, um...

18:20.565 --> 18:23.065
I fit in. You know?

18:23.067 --> 18:26.068
Well, I think you could
probably fit in here.

18:26.070 --> 18:29.015
Mmm. I don't think so, Mike.

18:29.017 --> 18:31.407
I'm more champagne and caviar

18:31.409 --> 18:36.145
and not "pin the tail on the walleye".

18:36.147 --> 18:38.180
You know, I think you
just might have invented

18:38.182 --> 18:40.449
a fun new game.

18:40.451 --> 18:42.752
We have caviar here, you
just have to dig it out

18:42.754 --> 18:44.286
of the fish with your finger.

18:46.324 --> 18:47.990
I wouldn't have any purpose.

18:47.992 --> 18:50.160
I don't want to go and stand around

18:50.162 --> 18:52.695
like, uh, Ed's trophy wife.

18:52.697 --> 18:54.264
Nobody's calling you a
trophy wife around here.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.502
I know, I'm trying to get it started.

18:57.501 --> 18:59.334
Look.

18:59.336 --> 19:01.036
Let's be honest.

19:01.038 --> 19:04.274
Somebody like me is gonna
stick out like a sore thumb

19:04.276 --> 19:06.875
- at this festival.
- Really?

19:06.877 --> 19:09.478
What kind of people you think
come to a festival like this?

19:09.480 --> 19:12.114
Oh, I don't know,
fishermen, hunters, uh,

19:12.116 --> 19:14.383
people who like dirt?

19:14.385 --> 19:17.978
And then the mayor, policemen,

19:17.980 --> 19:19.886
professors, janitors,

19:19.888 --> 19:22.599
and, I guess, people that like dirt.

19:22.601 --> 19:23.892
Yeah, those people.

19:23.894 --> 19:25.628
What do you think all
these people had in common

19:25.630 --> 19:26.895
before they came to the festival?

19:26.897 --> 19:28.064
I don't know.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.499
They all thought they would
have nothing in common.

19:30.501 --> 19:32.669
Look, I guarantee if
you give us a chance,

19:32.671 --> 19:34.871
you might find that you do fit in here.

19:35.973 --> 19:38.933
That sounds nice... I mean, fitting in.

19:38.935 --> 19:40.237
Fitting in, l-listen.

19:40.239 --> 19:42.644
Why don't you come on downstairs
and meet some of the people

19:42.646 --> 19:44.367
putting together the, the festival,

19:44.369 --> 19:47.083
and I might find, um,
something for you to paint.

19:47.085 --> 19:50.553
Oh. Well, I, I'm a
small-brush painter, though,

19:50.555 --> 19:51.888
I'm not a big-brush painter.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.590
All the big-brush painting's been done,

19:53.592 --> 19:56.092
but Mandy has a little
struggle right now

19:56.094 --> 19:58.695
with the-with the fine art part of this.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.163
Really? You mean, like still life?

20:01.165 --> 20:04.199
They rarely sit still.

20:04.201 --> 20:05.834
Come on down, and I'll show you.

20:05.836 --> 20:07.593
You might want to down
the rest of that Manhattan.

20:07.595 --> 20:08.640
I think you'll need it.

20:18.883 --> 20:22.504
Okay! Almost ready. Almost.

20:22.506 --> 20:24.328
Look at her. She's glowing.

20:24.330 --> 20:25.455
Yeah.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.724
If I haven't said thank
you yet, Mike, thanks.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.258
You actually already have said that,

20:29.260 --> 20:30.727
so next time you talk to your doctor,

20:30.729 --> 20:31.969
you might want to mention this?

20:33.431 --> 20:37.633
All right. Prepare
to be wowed, everyone.

20:37.635 --> 20:39.201
Looks like you're having a ball.

20:39.203 --> 20:40.637
Oh, I am, I am.

20:40.639 --> 20:44.707
Turns out I'm a Big Ass gal after all.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.584
Mom.

20:46.586 --> 20:48.379
All right. Now, first up,

20:48.381 --> 20:52.881
we have a very
traditional piece... Kyle.

20:52.883 --> 20:55.250
Hey, wow.

20:55.252 --> 20:57.286
- Nice.
- Wow.

20:57.288 --> 20:59.255
Yeah, now I've been a
tiger and a leopard.

20:59.257 --> 21:02.225
- Yep.
- Guess I have the heart of a predator.

21:02.227 --> 21:06.048
In some ways I've always known.

21:06.050 --> 21:10.967
And next, we have a tip
of the hat to surrealism.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.968
Mandy.

21:12.970 --> 21:14.403
Oh.

21:14.405 --> 21:16.171
Ooh.

21:16.173 --> 21:19.007
Yeah, I'm so wearing
this to the club tonight.

21:19.009 --> 21:21.244
- Yeah, you look amazing.
- Yeah.

21:21.246 --> 21:23.514
- Yeah, what, uh, what is she?
- What is that?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.281
- I'm an antelope.
- Oh, boy.

21:25.283 --> 21:26.783
- Uh-oh.
- You...

21:26.785 --> 21:29.622
Kyle? Kyle?!

21:31.842 --> 21:34.731
Bonnie, for the kids,
let's just stay away

21:34.733 --> 21:37.195
from predator and prey.
