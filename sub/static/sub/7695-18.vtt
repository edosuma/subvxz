00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:11.512 --> 00:13.844
Hey, guys, I've got
some exciting news.

00:13.844 --> 00:16.286
I got us all tickets to
the big college football game

00:16.286 --> 00:18.749
this weekend
at my alma mater.

00:18.749 --> 00:21.752
Go, Pioneers! Whoo!

00:23.194 --> 00:24.895
Trust me, guys,

00:24.895 --> 00:26.757
it wasn't much better
from back here.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.503
- Football? Pass.
- You're going.

00:32.503 --> 00:34.635
Honey, if you wanted
a sports guy,

00:34.635 --> 00:37.208
- you should've married one.
- Excuse me.

00:37.208 --> 00:39.840
I mean, please don't leave me.
I'll go.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.813
I can't believe I'm gonna
have a real-life college
experience.

00:42.813 --> 00:44.845
Ooh, I wanna be like
those kids on TV

00:44.845 --> 00:47.118
who paint their faces
and scream into the camera.

00:47.118 --> 00:49.850
Bree, please
do not embarrass us.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.052
Everyone knows that
the proper way to enjoy
a sporting event

00:52.052 --> 00:53.724
is to clap politely,

00:53.724 --> 00:55.726
not hoot and holler
like a buffoon.

00:55.726 --> 00:57.488
Whoo, go, Tech!

00:57.488 --> 00:59.460
She's at the ten,
the five,

00:59.460 --> 01:01.992
touchdown, Vikings!

01:01.992 --> 01:03.564
( frenzied yelling )

01:05.035 --> 01:07.037
You went to
Mission Creek Tech?

01:07.037 --> 01:09.370
Best 12 years
of my life.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.142
And I was on
the football team.

01:11.142 --> 01:12.903
No way. They let girls
play back then?

01:12.903 --> 01:15.376
Nope. Had to grow
a mustache and say I was

01:15.376 --> 01:17.248
Tom from Ohio.

01:18.809 --> 01:20.951
Ugh. Pioneers?

01:20.951 --> 01:23.584
I knew there was a reason
I never liked you.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.955
You went to
my rival school.

01:24.955 --> 01:27.958
Oh, yeah.
State's takin' Tech down.

01:27.958 --> 01:29.960
In your dreams.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.163
I just wish I could
be there to see it.

01:32.163 --> 01:34.024
The game's been
sold out for weeks.

01:34.024 --> 01:36.567
- You should talk to Tash--
- No, she shouldn't.

01:37.768 --> 01:41.902
Do you have tickets?

01:41.902 --> 01:44.074
Uh... no.

01:44.074 --> 01:46.777
Good. Because I know,
if you did,

01:46.777 --> 01:49.140
you'd invite
your bestie Terry.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.611
Right?

01:50.611 --> 01:53.744
Did she say bestie
or beastie?

01:55.946 --> 01:57.818
You just said
you didn't like me.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.451
I've grown as a person
since then. Come here.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.024
Don't fight it.
Like me back.

02:06.096 --> 02:08.628
The world's first
 bionic superhumans.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.300
They're stronger than us.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.734
Faster.
 Smarter.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.006
The next generation
 of the human race is...

02:16.006 --> 02:17.838
living on a bionic island.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.447
Come on, boys,
let's go.

02:56.447 --> 02:58.679
I want to get there early
so we can tailgate.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.451
- ( squeals )
- Hey!

03:00.451 --> 03:04.415
Who's ready to reluctantly
attend a sporting event?

03:04.415 --> 03:06.116
I know I am.

03:06.116 --> 03:07.788
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.290
I only have enough tickets
for our family.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.962
- Oh, great.
- Immediate family.

03:11.962 --> 03:15.326
- Fantastic.
- I don't have
a ticket for you.

03:15.326 --> 03:17.868
Sounds good.

03:17.868 --> 03:19.800
If he's not going,
I'm not going.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.032
Aw, you'd really
do that for me?

03:22.032 --> 03:23.534
Of course, man.
We're buds.

03:23.534 --> 03:25.035
I'm not gonna leave you
here by yourself.

03:25.035 --> 03:27.338
Then I guess we have
an extra ticket.

03:27.338 --> 03:29.580
Oh, I'll take it.

03:29.580 --> 03:31.482
I can't believe
I'm actually saying this,

03:31.482 --> 03:33.284
but since we have
an extra ticket,

03:33.284 --> 03:34.915
should we maybe
offer it to Perry?

03:37.047 --> 03:40.090
( raucous laughter )

03:44.124 --> 03:48.329
( sighs ) Well, it's
just you and me, Bob.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.730
What do you wanna
do today?

03:49.730 --> 03:52.032
I know. I can
leave you here

03:52.032 --> 03:53.864
while I go to
that football game.

03:53.864 --> 03:56.467
I got an even
better idea.

03:56.467 --> 03:58.409
Go get the web cam.

04:00.571 --> 04:02.473
- He's Bob.
- And he's Adam.

04:02.473 --> 04:04.445
Welcome to Breaking Stuff
 With Bob and Adam,

04:04.445 --> 04:06.246
- the place where Bob...
- And Adam...

04:06.246 --> 04:08.048
break stuff.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.451
We're gonna break
old equipment from
our junk room.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.353
Like this laptop.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.355
Not my new laptop.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.226
This old speaker
is ten times bigger

04:16.226 --> 04:18.088
than the ones
we use today,

04:18.088 --> 04:19.589
but not for long.

04:21.591 --> 04:23.594
That was awesome!

04:23.594 --> 04:26.036
Man, that was a great
first episode.

04:26.036 --> 04:28.899
Wait, I was supposed
to be recording this?

04:33.604 --> 04:35.746
Hi. I'm All-Pro
three-time Super Bowl champion

04:35.746 --> 04:37.147
Willie McGinest,

04:37.147 --> 04:39.009
and I'm standing next to
Pioneer Pete,

04:39.009 --> 04:40.951
the oldest monument
in Mission Creek.

04:40.951 --> 04:43.814
A hundred years ago,
Pioneer Pete saved the college

04:43.814 --> 04:45.556
from a disastrous fire.

04:45.556 --> 04:48.519
The remaining wood was used
to build this beloved statue.

04:48.519 --> 04:51.191
( spectators cheering )

04:53.193 --> 04:56.367
Oh, to be back
in college.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.268
I had the best days
of my life here.

04:58.268 --> 05:00.671
Other than the day
you married

05:00.671 --> 05:03.203
the Donald Davenport,
 right, sweetie?

05:03.203 --> 05:06.076
Get me my own island
and we'll talk.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.245
Hey, why is everyone
staring at us?

05:15.245 --> 05:17.448
Because they know
we're bionic.

05:17.448 --> 05:19.350
I am totally using
to get in with them.

05:19.350 --> 05:22.052
Are you really
that shallow?

05:22.052 --> 05:23.624
You're gonna flaunt
your bionics

05:23.624 --> 05:26.126
just to impress
a bunch of
tailgating gorillas?

05:26.126 --> 05:28.429
Yes.

05:32.002 --> 05:34.505
( all booing )

05:34.505 --> 05:38.669
Leo, why are you wearing
the Vikings colors?

05:38.669 --> 05:41.011
What do I know about
team colors?

05:41.011 --> 05:44.174
Just be happy it's clean.

05:44.174 --> 05:47.077
See, this is why you need
Mommy to pick out your clothes.

05:47.077 --> 05:49.720
Hey, Dooley,
nice threads.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.853
Oh, great, I've been
looking for a grease rag.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.725
What are you
doing here?

05:54.725 --> 05:57.257
I'm here for the Ultimate
Tailgate Challenge.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.059
The winner scores tickets
for the big game.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.892
And since I cook and eat
most of my food

06:01.892 --> 06:04.034
in a parking lot already,
I'm a shoo-in.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.598
For what, parasites?

06:07.598 --> 06:10.901
Shut it, Frodo.

06:10.901 --> 06:15.305
Behold, my tailgating
spectacular.

06:15.305 --> 06:16.747
Great. I'm starving.

06:19.149 --> 06:20.681
And now I am not.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.184
You're cooking food
on your car?

06:24.184 --> 06:27.788
Better than anything
you ever cooked.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.791
Ooh, check out
my rotisserie chicken.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.897
So do you have a way
to cook them,

06:36.897 --> 06:39.199
or are you more of
a raw bird kind of gal?

06:47.938 --> 06:50.481
Mmm!

06:50.481 --> 06:52.483
Delish!

06:52.483 --> 06:55.085
Hey, what are you all
doin' here anyway?

06:55.085 --> 06:56.747
The game's sold out.

06:56.747 --> 06:59.119
( all stammering )

06:59.119 --> 07:00.791
We came for the chicken.

07:02.793 --> 07:04.455
( nervous laughter )

07:09.259 --> 07:11.101
Is that diesel?

07:13.564 --> 07:15.405
Welcome back to
 Breaking Stuff With Bob...

07:15.405 --> 07:16.637
And Adam.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.769
- He's still Bob.
- And I'm Bob.

07:20.611 --> 07:23.073
It's time for old
Mr. Laser Disc Player

07:23.073 --> 07:25.015
to meet my lasers.

07:30.681 --> 07:32.182
Yeah!

07:33.353 --> 07:35.455
That was incredible.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.427
If we keep this up,
we'll be the number one

07:37.427 --> 07:39.229
web show of the week.

07:39.229 --> 07:41.031
Then less talking
and more breaking.

07:41.031 --> 07:42.192
Yeah!

07:44.795 --> 07:46.567
I think we ran
out of stuff.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.740
Hey, I know something
that'll get us

07:49.740 --> 07:52.342
even more viewers
than breaking stuff.

07:55.005 --> 07:57.548
Two bionic guys
with super strength

07:57.548 --> 08:00.350
play catch with
the coffee table.

08:00.350 --> 08:01.812
I like it.

08:04.414 --> 08:06.286
Okay, Bob,
just to warn you,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.318
if you don't catch it,
you might get decapitated.

08:12.262 --> 08:14.264
Hey, forget bionic
superhumans.

08:14.264 --> 08:16.567
We should be movers.

08:19.129 --> 08:20.701
Okay, let's make this
more challenging.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.873
- Bob, go long.
- On it.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.439
Oh, no!

08:29.439 --> 08:31.211
I think we scratched
the table.

08:37.047 --> 08:39.419
You know, if you don't
think about how it was cooked,

08:39.419 --> 08:41.321
the chicken is actually
quite tasty.

08:41.321 --> 08:45.025
Oh, I ran out of chicken.
That's falcon.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.198
I'm done.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.432
But you haven't even tried
my sausages yet.

09:00.040 --> 09:04.344
You cooked them
in the tailpipe?

09:04.344 --> 09:06.647
You call it a tailpipe,
I call it a smoker.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.480
Any time I see hot air
coming out of something,

09:10.480 --> 09:13.353
the first thing I think is,
how can I put meat in there?

09:15.025 --> 09:18.358
And to think
you're still single.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.360
( people cheering )

09:20.360 --> 09:23.393
Well, that's enough
E. coli for one day.

09:25.195 --> 09:26.566
Time to go wow
my college buds

09:26.566 --> 09:28.739
with some bionic
razzle dazzle.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.604
( chanting )
M.C. State,
M.C. State!

09:33.604 --> 09:35.606
Hey, guys, what's
everyone looking at?

09:35.606 --> 09:39.780
- I can't hear you!
- M.C. State, M.C. State,

09:39.780 --> 09:43.984
M.C. State,
M.C. State, M.C. State.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.315
Chase?!

09:45.315 --> 09:47.117
What are you doing?

09:47.117 --> 09:48.889
I thought you said
flaunting your bionics

09:48.889 --> 09:50.520
for attention
was shallow.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.923
It is, and I'm
okay with that.

09:52.923 --> 09:54.925
They like me.

09:54.925 --> 09:57.898
Chase, Chase, Chase, Chase!

09:57.898 --> 10:00.130
( cheering )

10:02.472 --> 10:05.776
Hey, guys, I just
picked up the tickets
from Will Call.

10:05.776 --> 10:07.838
They're on
the 50-yard line.

10:07.838 --> 10:10.410
Oh! I don't know
what that means,

10:10.410 --> 10:12.482
but let's get outta here
before Perry sees them.

10:12.482 --> 10:14.845
( growling )

10:14.845 --> 10:18.318
Please tell me there's
a four-foot pit bull
behind us.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.520
You have tickets?!

10:20.520 --> 10:22.322
You lied to me.
How could you?

10:22.322 --> 10:24.324
We're family.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.997
Okay, fine, you can have
our extra ticket.

10:26.997 --> 10:29.629
No. After you lied to me,
I want all of them. Gimme!

10:44.444 --> 10:46.116
Ha! What do you know?
I caught 'em.

10:49.519 --> 10:50.721
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

10:50.721 --> 10:52.723
Those aren't the tickets.

11:05.435 --> 11:08.168
- I'll get them.
- No way.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.370
If I can't have them,
neither can you.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.844
No!

11:16.376 --> 11:18.508
Now that's a hot ticket.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.960
Good news.
The chicken's still delish,

11:29.960 --> 11:32.963
and the tickets are like
an extra layer of skin.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.397
( booing )

11:37.397 --> 11:39.569
All right,
keep walking.

11:39.569 --> 11:42.733
- Can we just go home?
- No way.

11:42.733 --> 11:45.375
I have been looking
forward to this for months.

11:45.375 --> 11:48.338
There's gotta be a way
we can get into that game.

11:48.338 --> 11:51.742
How? She ate our tickets!

11:53.513 --> 11:55.685
Fifty-yard line?!

11:57.417 --> 11:59.489
Then we are just gonna
have to do whatever it takes

11:59.489 --> 12:02.722
to beat Perry at that
Ultimate Tailgate Challenge.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.724
Come on, Leo, let's go.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.328
Team Davenport
is takin' you down.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.660
Good luck. I've been
in the mouth of a shark,

12:10.660 --> 12:12.702
a bear, and three kinds
of snake,

12:12.702 --> 12:14.564
and they're all
grillin' on my car.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.571
Bob, what are we
gonna do?

12:21.571 --> 12:24.444
If Mr. Davenport sees this,
we're gonna be in
a lot of trouble.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.116
I got it.

12:26.116 --> 12:28.779
If we destroy
everything else
in the academy,

12:28.779 --> 12:31.121
he'll never even notice
the capsules.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.654
Bob, that is
a horrible idea.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.787
We don't have time
to do all that.

12:37.988 --> 12:39.890
Don't worry.

12:39.890 --> 12:41.461
I've got something.

12:43.834 --> 12:45.435
Does this look close?

12:47.497 --> 12:48.999
That looks terrible.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.271
You should try
the duct tape.

12:56.847 --> 12:58.478
Excuse me.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.950
I'm judging the Ultimate
Tailgate Challenge.

12:59.950 --> 13:01.651
You mind if I take
a look around?

13:01.651 --> 13:04.514
Not at all, Big and Tall.

13:05.615 --> 13:07.557
This is Perry's
Meat Wagon.

13:07.557 --> 13:10.921
Let's see, we've got
hamburgers, hanger steak...

13:10.921 --> 13:12.562
Wait. What kind of
meat is that?

13:12.562 --> 13:15.025
Hmm. Hard to tell.

13:15.025 --> 13:17.597
On the way here,
I took a shortcut
through the zoo.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.834
Can you believe it?

13:23.834 --> 13:26.476
This people actually
think I'm fun.

13:26.476 --> 13:29.039
Me! I don't even
think I'm fun.

13:30.140 --> 13:31.912
Isn't college awesome?

13:31.912 --> 13:34.915
I wouldn't know.
I haven't talked
to any of them

13:34.915 --> 13:37.387
because you've been
hogging all the attention.

13:37.387 --> 13:39.749
But you know what?
I have bionics, too.

13:39.749 --> 13:44.124
Hey, guys, ever seen
a cheerleader at super speed?

13:44.124 --> 13:47.457
Two, four, six, eight,
go...

13:49.829 --> 13:52.132
( weakly )
State.

13:52.132 --> 13:55.465
( all booing )

13:55.465 --> 13:57.667
Don't worry.
I'm still here.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.309
( cheering )

14:09.980 --> 14:12.152
Ooh, is it over?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.984
Wait. It couldn't be.

14:13.984 --> 14:16.056
I just got here.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.828
Who's booing now?

14:18.828 --> 14:20.590
- Go, Vikings.
- Pioneers.

14:20.590 --> 14:21.831
Pioneers. Go, Pioneers.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.397
Hey, Perry,
check this out.

14:33.203 --> 14:35.205
And it's got
satellite TV

14:35.205 --> 14:38.408
with surround sound
for your viewing pleasure.

14:41.551 --> 14:43.954
Oh... anyone thirsty?

14:43.954 --> 14:48.618
It dispenses 30 different kinds
of beverages.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.492
Who cares?
Nobody likes drinks.

14:54.324 --> 14:56.466
And when the Pioneers win...

14:56.466 --> 14:57.897
( people cheering weakly )

14:57.897 --> 15:00.770
I said
when the Pioneers win...

15:00.770 --> 15:02.372
( loud cheering )

15:02.372 --> 15:04.634
Push this one little button,
the hood pops up,

15:04.634 --> 15:08.508
and we get a spectacular
fireworks display.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.241
You should probably just
give me the tickets right now.

15:11.241 --> 15:14.844
Well, clearly, your vehicle's
the one to beat.

15:14.844 --> 15:17.347
You know, we could combine
our tailgates

15:17.347 --> 15:19.849
so that we both
win the tickets.

15:19.849 --> 15:21.751
- Really?
- Never!

15:21.751 --> 15:23.723
Crank it up, Donald.

15:23.723 --> 15:27.497
( dance music blaring )

15:29.759 --> 15:33.333
Mom, you're supposed to be
punishing her, not me.

15:36.766 --> 15:39.169
Nice goin', Bob.

15:39.169 --> 15:41.911
Replacing the broken capsules
with the ones from the dorm
was genius.

15:41.911 --> 15:45.445
Yeah. So what if other
students need them to survive.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.817
That's tomorrow's problem.

15:47.817 --> 15:49.679
Hey, I know
we had fun today,

15:49.679 --> 15:52.222
but do you think we might've
taken things too far?

15:52.222 --> 15:54.254
Absolutely.
What's your point?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.326
Well, I was thinking.

15:56.326 --> 15:58.658
Even though
we got away with it,

15:58.658 --> 16:01.291
maybe next time,
we shouldn't do something
so destructive.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.892
You're right.

16:02.892 --> 16:05.795
BOTH: And that was
 Life Lessons With Bob and Adam.

16:05.795 --> 16:07.797
Now back to breaking stuff.

16:07.797 --> 16:09.369
Yeah!

16:10.800 --> 16:12.972
Not my laptop, Bob.

16:18.348 --> 16:20.910
Welcome back to
the Ultimate Tailgate Challenge.

16:20.910 --> 16:23.283
It's come down to
these two finalists,

16:23.283 --> 16:26.956
with the winner getting
six tickets to the big game.

16:26.956 --> 16:30.290
Oh, yeah, nothin' better
than me and five empty seats.

16:32.762 --> 16:38.828
( chanting )
Chase, Chase, Chase, Chase,
Chase, Chase, Chase!

16:38.828 --> 16:39.769
You hear that?

16:39.769 --> 16:41.501
They're chanting my name,

16:41.501 --> 16:44.304
and not because
they're angry with me.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.736
Great.

16:46.736 --> 16:48.738
This was probably my one chance
to have a college experience,

16:48.738 --> 16:51.041
and you're having
the day I wanted.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.083
I know. Can you
take some pictures?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.746
Bree.

16:56.746 --> 16:58.918
Bree, wait.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.590
Look, I'm sorry.

17:00.590 --> 17:02.622
I didn't mean
to steal your thunder.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.195
But there's no reason
we can't both have fun.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.858
I have an idea.

17:14.404 --> 17:16.606
Ready to do what
no Mission Creek
State student

17:16.606 --> 17:18.768
has ever been able
to do before?

17:18.768 --> 17:20.270
Oh, yeah.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.644
Whoo!

17:27.416 --> 17:29.249
She got the Viking
mascot head.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.821
- That was epic, Bree.
- ( all cheering )

17:31.821 --> 17:34.784
However, it is
technically
stealing,

17:34.784 --> 17:36.286
so I'm gonna have
to return it

17:36.286 --> 17:39.189
- to its rightful owner.
- ( all booing )

17:46.196 --> 17:47.837
Ah! And once again,

17:47.837 --> 17:50.039
everything is right
with the world.

17:50.039 --> 17:53.243
M.C. State,
M.C. State!

17:53.243 --> 17:55.745
I'm out of mustard.

17:55.745 --> 17:57.777
Can I trade you
this bottle of ketchup?

17:57.777 --> 18:00.180
I found it under a bridge,
so you know it's good.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.653
Sorry. We don't need
your ketchup.

18:03.653 --> 18:04.984
( growling )

18:04.984 --> 18:07.887
This is what happens
when you try to be nice.

18:12.021 --> 18:15.565
Seriously? I just
put this on!

18:19.729 --> 18:21.671
( booing )

18:21.671 --> 18:23.433
Leo, stop.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.675
They think you're defacing
the Pioneer mascot.

18:25.675 --> 18:29.008
Oh, no. No!

18:29.008 --> 18:32.041
- ( booing )
- The judge is coming over.

18:32.041 --> 18:33.313
He's gonna think
they're booing us.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.514
He's not with us.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.847
- Boo!
- Come on!

18:37.847 --> 18:39.048
Mom.

18:39.048 --> 18:40.550
Sorry, honey.

18:40.550 --> 18:42.322
I just really
want those tickets.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.694
Boo!!

18:47.957 --> 18:49.799
Really? That's how
it's gonna be?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.634
Hey, Perry,
want some help?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.466
Yes. This is my number.

18:56.466 --> 18:58.508
Give it to
Mr. McGinest,

18:58.508 --> 19:00.770
and tell him not to
call after 9:00.

19:08.077 --> 19:10.049
Dooley, these
aren't right.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.121
My kabobs need to be
flame-broiled.

19:12.121 --> 19:14.023
I got this.

19:28.998 --> 19:30.069
Mm. That's delicious.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.572
You just sacked
my taste buds.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.046
That's not fair.
He's using bionics.

19:37.046 --> 19:39.108
I gotta find a way
to cook these things faster.

19:39.108 --> 19:41.381
Throw some frank-burgers
in the tailpipe.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.555
I gotta find a way
to turn the heat up.

19:45.555 --> 19:47.156
Donald, be careful.

19:47.156 --> 19:50.320
I'm fine. I just need
to make it hotter.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.525
That may have been
the wrong button.

19:55.525 --> 19:57.797
What do you mean,
the wrong button?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.599
Duck!

20:07.136 --> 20:10.109
Oh, love the fireworks show.

20:10.109 --> 20:14.284
Especially when it lit
Pioneer Pete on fire.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.948
Burn, Petey, burn!

20:20.920 --> 20:22.592
Did I win?

20:29.529 --> 20:32.131
And since there was
so much fire damage
to the stadium,

20:32.131 --> 20:34.734
they had to cancel
the game.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.166
- You're going to
the next one.
- Yes, dear.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.040
I'm gonna go
take a shower.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.042
My body paint
is running...

20:43.042 --> 20:44.243
off campus.

20:46.276 --> 20:48.117
I should take one, too.

20:48.117 --> 20:50.820
I still smell like
Perry's diesel dogs.

20:52.822 --> 20:56.756
Man, I can't believe
you guys started a fire.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.328
Talk about careless.

20:58.328 --> 21:01.561
Very irresponsible.

21:01.561 --> 21:05.495
Hey, guys, look,
they're showing it on TV.

21:05.495 --> 21:08.037
And since there's
 no game highlights
 to show you

21:08.037 --> 21:11.771
please enjoy the most
popular web clip of the week.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.977
Whoa, those actors
look just like us.
