<i>GRACE: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.116 --> 00:04.383
Amy, Clementine is a friend.

00:04.417 --> 00:06.518
She's just a friend,
a friend from my past.

00:06.553 --> 00:09.521
I was fine until she
showed up and reminded me

00:09.556 --> 00:12.391
that you're at college with
a bunch of good looking women.

00:12.425 --> 00:14.259
I wish I was the father.

00:14.294 --> 00:15.427
You don't want to be responsible

00:15.462 --> 00:17.363
for my having a baby at 15.

00:17.397 --> 00:20.099
What if I went out with Henry,

00:20.133 --> 00:21.266
just to make my parents happy,

00:21.301 --> 00:24.203
and then Henry and I could break up

00:24.237 --> 00:26.438
when you and I can see
each other again. What!

00:26.473 --> 00:28.440
He cheated. KATHLEEN: Jack?

00:28.475 --> 00:30.476
After I talked to him
and his dad talked to him?

00:30.510 --> 00:33.345
You need to have enough
self-respect to break up with him.

00:33.380 --> 00:35.481
<i>JACK: I've been trying to
get back with you for years.</i>

00:35.515 --> 00:38.384
And if all it takes for
you to take me seriously

00:38.418 --> 00:41.253
is that I go back to church
and try to be a better person,

00:41.287 --> 00:42.521
<i>that's what I'm going to do.</i>

00:42.555 --> 00:44.223
Ben's still pining for you?

00:44.257 --> 00:45.424
Yeah.

00:45.458 --> 00:48.127
I'm trying to smooth things
over with you here, so...

00:48.161 --> 00:49.361
So what? Nothing has changed.

00:49.396 --> 00:51.230
I'm still standing
here getting a lecture

00:51.264 --> 00:53.065
and I still can't go out with Dylan.

00:53.099 --> 00:55.434
I wanted to rush off and get married

00:55.468 --> 00:58.303
because I just thought that

00:58.338 --> 00:59.505
I might be gay.

01:01.408 --> 01:03.208
They're late, I can't
believe they're late.

01:03.243 --> 01:04.309
They've never been late before.

01:04.343 --> 01:05.343
It's not a good sign.

01:05.378 --> 01:07.312
What do you mean?

01:07.347 --> 01:09.481
I mean, people who are late are totally
selfish and have no regard for anyone else,

01:09.516 --> 01:11.216
that's what I mean.

01:11.251 --> 01:13.185
They should have more respect for you.

01:13.219 --> 01:15.087
It wasn't easy to find a
couple that I liked, all right?

01:15.121 --> 01:16.455
And do not get all judgmental

01:16.489 --> 01:20.125
because I'm sure, like everyone
else, they have their flaws,

01:20.160 --> 01:21.193
I just don't want to hear about them.

01:21.227 --> 01:22.327
It was just an observation.

01:22.362 --> 01:24.396
People who are late don't
respect other people.

01:24.431 --> 01:25.497
Did you hear what I said?

01:25.532 --> 01:27.232
I'm just looking out for you.

01:27.267 --> 01:28.267
And her.

01:28.301 --> 01:29.468
Well, who asked you to?

01:29.502 --> 01:31.069
I can look out for myself.

01:32.205 --> 01:33.472
Kathy!

01:33.506 --> 01:36.241
Hi sweetie! We must have
missed you coming in!

01:37.444 --> 01:39.077
And I don't know who you are, young man,

01:39.112 --> 01:40.479
but you are absolutely right.

01:40.513 --> 01:43.282
People who keep people waiting
have no respect for other people.

01:43.316 --> 01:46.118
But just for the
record, we were on time.

01:47.454 --> 01:50.122
Hi, I'm Jonathan,
this is my wife, Sonya.

01:50.156 --> 01:52.257
So nice to meet you. Hi.

01:52.292 --> 01:55.127
That's the idiot I told you about.

01:55.161 --> 01:58.397
Ethan. Hi. And eavesdropping
is not cool either.

01:58.431 --> 02:00.265
Uh, do you mind if we sit down?

02:00.300 --> 02:02.067
Oh.

02:02.101 --> 02:05.237
No, Kathy, please don't
get up. Stay right there.

02:11.110 --> 02:13.011
So why can't you guys have kids?

02:14.013 --> 02:15.214
(THUD) Ow!

02:16.182 --> 02:18.183
And why can't you have manners?

02:18.218 --> 02:19.384
He's a troubled youth.

02:19.419 --> 02:22.087
I'm not that troubled, I'm
just looking out for her.

02:22.121 --> 02:23.288
Oh.

02:23.323 --> 02:25.991
And our infertility
would concern you how?

02:26.025 --> 02:27.159
Maybe you're not meant to have kids.

02:27.193 --> 02:28.393
Oh, God!

02:28.428 --> 02:30.329
No, it's a fair question.

02:30.363 --> 02:32.164
That's good. I'm glad
you feel that way, dear,

02:32.198 --> 02:33.265
because about to punch this guy.

02:34.434 --> 02:38.036
We carry the gene for Tay-Sachs,

02:38.071 --> 02:39.238
so we decided to adopt.

02:39.272 --> 02:43.041
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

02:43.076 --> 02:45.277
I don't know what that
isbut it doesn't sound od.

02:45.311 --> 02:48.213
No, it's not. You have
any more questions?

02:48.248 --> 02:49.448
No, he doesn't.

02:49.482 --> 02:51.316
Are you religious people?

02:51.351 --> 02:53.085
I thought you weren't
concerned about that.

02:54.487 --> 02:56.355
Um...

02:56.389 --> 02:58.524
Jonathan's Jewish, I'm Catholic.

02:58.558 --> 03:02.127
We always just check "none" on
any questions about religion,

03:02.161 --> 03:05.097
but we are very spiritual
people. (TEXTING)

03:05.131 --> 03:08.033
You don't have to answer his
questions, okay? He's just a kid.

03:08.067 --> 03:10.068
He's got absolutely nothing to
do with this. Does he, Kathy?

03:10.336 --> 03:12.304
Definitely not.

03:12.338 --> 03:13.372
Are you financially stable?

03:13.406 --> 03:15.007
Yep, I am. And you know what?

03:15.041 --> 03:16.108
I'll give you a hundred
bucks to shut up.

03:16.142 --> 03:17.376
Why? You hiding something?

03:20.280 --> 03:21.480
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

03:25.218 --> 03:27.486
Hey Ricky, we've got a problem.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.488
Why's that? Kathy wants
you to go get Ethan.

03:29.522 --> 03:32.391
Did she specifically say
me? Because she texted you.

03:32.425 --> 03:33.492
I'm already dressed for bed.

03:33.526 --> 03:36.261
Yeah, but it's 7:00. So?

03:36.296 --> 03:38.430
What's he doing that
I have to pick him up?

03:38.464 --> 03:40.198
(CELL PHONE BEEPS) I don't know.

03:40.233 --> 03:42.434
(CHUCKLES) But now
everything is in caps.

03:44.103 --> 03:46.071
(READING MESSAGE)

03:46.105 --> 03:48.240
Oh, geez. All right.

03:48.274 --> 03:50.108
Why not? It's not like
I have anything to do.

03:50.143 --> 03:52.110
'Cause, you know, college is
so much easier than high school,

03:52.145 --> 03:53.412
I don't even have to study.

03:53.446 --> 03:55.380
And I can cook and clean
up and put John to bed,

03:55.415 --> 03:57.215
and hold down a job, no problem.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.217
He's like your brother or something.

03:59.252 --> 04:01.086
I took those two over there,

04:01.120 --> 04:04.256
and he's supposed to have a ride home
with the couple adopting the baby.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.291
I have my first English
lit paper due in two days

04:06.326 --> 04:07.459
and I want to finish it tonight

04:07.493 --> 04:09.227
so I can go over it
again before I turn it in.

04:09.262 --> 04:11.196
Just go get him, okay?

04:11.230 --> 04:12.397
Then you'll have the rest of
the night to do your paper.

04:13.132 --> 04:14.232

Okay, what do you mean,
"if I get transferred"?

04:26.312 --> 04:29.247
(CHUCKLES) Like we wouldn't
take the baby with us?

04:29.282 --> 04:31.350
You don't have to get
sarcastic, it's a valid question.

04:31.384 --> 04:33.418
Ethan,

04:33.453 --> 04:35.454
we're going to be good parents.

04:35.488 --> 04:37.089
We love this baby.

04:37.123 --> 04:38.190
Do you?

04:38.224 --> 04:39.992
Shut up.

04:40.026 --> 04:43.395
Okay, you know what? This is not a
healthy relationship for you. Okay?

04:43.429 --> 04:45.030
Or for us.

04:45.064 --> 04:47.032
You don't know anything
about our relationship.

04:47.066 --> 04:49.267
I know you feel very protective of Kathy

04:49.302 --> 04:52.371
and you're just asking us these
questions out of concern for her,

04:52.405 --> 04:54.039
and out of love for her.

04:54.073 --> 04:56.441
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Ethan is my boyfriend.

04:56.476 --> 04:58.176
Boy friend. Friend.

04:58.211 --> 05:02.014
And you're my girlfriend.
And that's why I'm here.

05:02.048 --> 05:03.949
Look, that's precious
cargo in that belly.

05:03.983 --> 05:06.018
I'm just making sure it
gets to the right port.

05:06.052 --> 05:08.020
(THUD) Ow!

05:08.054 --> 05:10.155
That was me. (CLEARS THROAT)

05:10.189 --> 05:11.890
That's our daughter
you're talking about.

05:11.924 --> 05:13.125
Yeah, why don't you just quit talking?

This is why Mom said you
shouldn't meet these people.

05:50.196 --> 05:52.064
You don't know when to
keep your mouth shut.

05:52.098 --> 05:54.933
Good thing I didn't. If these people
can't handle a few simple questions,

05:54.967 --> 05:56.034
they shouldn't be adopting a baby.

05:56.069 --> 05:57.169
It's none of your business.

05:57.203 --> 05:59.271
I'm sure Kathy and her grandmother

05:59.305 --> 06:02.174
all put a lot of thought
just the right coupleng

06:02.208 --> 06:03.909
and then you went and screwed it all up.

06:03.943 --> 06:05.243
I didn't screw it all up, they did.

06:05.278 --> 06:07.946
No! You did! into a big argument.

06:07.980 --> 06:09.314
Now the adoption could be in jeopardy.

06:09.348 --> 06:13.218
Then maybe she'll just
She'd be a great mother.

06:13.252 --> 06:15.353
Ethan, she doesn't want
to be a mother at 15.

06:15.388 --> 06:18.290
She wants the than what she can provide.

06:18.324 --> 06:20.192
What are you thinking, a dad at 15?ld be

06:20.226 --> 06:21.293
(SCOFFS) You were.

06:21.327 --> 06:23.295
Geez.

06:23.329 --> 06:26.098
You are not the father. were the father,

06:26.132 --> 06:28.200
I think Kathy baby to be adoptedhe

06:28.234 --> 06:31.236
because the two of you
mature enough to be parents.

06:31.270 --> 06:34.106
And I was 16 more mature than you.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.174
Blah, blah, blah. what I'm capable of,

06:36.209 --> 06:38.043
you don't know Kathy,
you don't know anything.

06:38.077 --> 06:39.478
Yeah, I do. I know a lot.

06:39.512 --> 06:43.248
And I know if I had it all to do
over again, I never would have...

06:43.282 --> 06:45.117
Go on. You have to fix this.

06:45.151 --> 06:46.985
You have to apologize to everyone.

06:47.019 --> 06:50.088
And don't even offer an excuse
because there is no excuse.

06:50.123 --> 06:53.191
This is a very serious matter,
this is the life of a child.

06:53.226 --> 06:54.359
Exactly.

06:54.393 --> 06:56.094
Ethan,

06:57.263 --> 06:59.164
this is also about Kathy.

06:59.198 --> 07:02.200
And Kathy's life. And Kathy's choices.

07:02.235 --> 07:03.935
You have to have respect for her.

07:05.171 --> 07:07.305
I think Mom already had
this conversation with you,

07:07.340 --> 07:11.009
and maybe you couldn't
hear her, but listen to me.

07:11.043 --> 07:12.944
Back the freak off.

07:20.019 --> 07:22.020
We don't have to go all the way.

07:24.824 --> 07:26.057
I'll settle for halfway.
to go all the way.

07:28.127 --> 07:30.962
It's so hot, not having sex.

07:30.997 --> 07:33.865
Yeah. Kind of.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.802
Hey, guys! you to get home.r

07:36.836 --> 07:38.036
Mom made some brownies.

07:38.871 --> 07:40.272
Oh. Thank you, Tom,

07:40.306 --> 07:42.007
you can just leave them on the table.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.842
Yeah, thanks Tom. The table's fine.

07:43.876 --> 07:45.076
What is wrong with you?

07:45.111 --> 07:46.945
Why are you both out of breath?

07:46.979 --> 07:50.215
Uh... We've been...

07:50.249 --> 07:51.917
...running. We've been running.

07:51.951 --> 07:55.854
Yeah, running, and now we need to rest.

07:55.888 --> 07:57.088
Mind if I join you?

07:57.123 --> 07:59.825
Uh, I just have a few minutes, buddy,

07:59.859 --> 08:02.928
and I need while we're, um, resting.

08:02.962 --> 08:06.198
Yeah, he needs to talk
to me. Private talk, so...

08:06.232 --> 08:08.834
Goodnight. Yeah, yeah.

08:25.251 --> 08:28.186
You cannot

08:28.221 --> 08:31.089
spend the night.

08:31.123 --> 08:32.823
We're not gonna do anything.

08:32.859 --> 08:34.025
Hey, let's take another
look at that book.

08:34.059 --> 08:35.894
No, that's enough reading for one night.

08:35.928 --> 08:37.229
I don't know whose book that is anyway.

08:37.263 --> 08:39.030
It's not a very nice book.

08:39.065 --> 08:40.799
No, it isn't.

08:40.832 --> 08:42.200
Let me stay over. Just sleep over.

08:42.235 --> 08:45.937
Oh come on, we're going to sleep
together and not do anything?

08:45.972 --> 08:47.939
Yeah. I don't think so. (DOOR OPENS)

08:48.941 --> 08:50.842
TOM: Oh brother.

08:50.877 --> 08:53.278
I'm gone two minutes. Look at you!

08:55.948 --> 08:57.816
Get a room, will you?

09:03.055 --> 09:04.890
Goodnight, George.

09:04.924 --> 09:06.024
Goodnight, Kathleen. Call me.

09:06.058 --> 09:07.726
I will. I'll call you and say goodnight.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.793
Okay.

09:10.129 --> 09:11.229
Mmm.

09:14.767 --> 09:16.134
Let me know when you want more.

09:16.168 --> 09:18.970
(LAUGHS) You are so juvenile.

09:19.005 --> 09:20.939
Yeah, but you knew that when
you got into this relationship.

09:20.973 --> 09:22.007
Mmm-hmm.

09:22.041 --> 09:24.075
Well, I can't wait. You don't have to.

09:24.110 --> 09:25.911
Get out of here. Goodnight.

09:30.850 --> 09:32.083
I left my book.

09:32.118 --> 09:33.752
What book is that?

09:33.786 --> 09:35.220
Just my book.

09:37.123 --> 09:39.791
<i>That's your book? Fifty Spices?</i>

09:39.825 --> 09:40.926
Yes.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.127
Tom, where did you get a book like that?

09:42.161 --> 09:48.166
I fired someone for
reading that book at work.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.001
And then you kept it?

09:50.036 --> 09:54.139
I kept it, but I didn't read it at work.

09:54.173 --> 09:56.107
I read it on the bus.

09:57.877 --> 09:59.210
(SIGHS) Well, I threw it away.

09:59.245 --> 10:02.013
No you didn't. It's right
there on the counter.

10:02.048 --> 10:04.082
Tom, I don't think you should
be reading books like that.

10:04.116 --> 10:07.052
Why not? I don't have a girlfriend.

10:07.086 --> 10:10.221
A dirty book is not a
substitute for a girlfriend.

10:10.256 --> 10:12.991
It's not dirty, it's sexy.

10:13.025 --> 10:15.226
Uh, no, it's really not.

10:15.261 --> 10:17.996
Tom, for people who
haven't had sex before

10:18.030 --> 10:19.931
and are young, like yourself,

10:19.966 --> 10:23.902
books like that create ridiculous
expectations about women.

10:23.936 --> 10:26.972
And those kind of books, honey,
are very disrespectful to women.

10:27.006 --> 10:32.877
Believe me, I'm getting
a new respect for women.

10:32.912 --> 10:39.150
I had no idea women would
let you do things like that.

10:39.185 --> 10:41.786
They won't. Oh, they will.

10:41.821 --> 10:44.222
It's right there in that book.

10:46.292 --> 10:49.194
What? I think we should
throw that book away.

10:49.228 --> 10:53.198
It's not our book, it's my book.

10:57.269 --> 10:59.804
(EXHALES) That was, uh...

11:00.206 --> 11:02.140
That was frustrating.

11:02.174 --> 11:03.208
But it was fun.

11:03.242 --> 11:04.909
Yeah. Yeah, it was fun.

11:04.944 --> 11:06.911
Wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah.

11:06.946 --> 11:10.215
I love being back with
you, being a couple again.

11:10.249 --> 11:12.217
Yeah, it's great. It's really great.

11:12.251 --> 11:13.818
You're going to be late.

11:13.853 --> 11:15.020
Oh, I know. I have to go.

11:15.054 --> 11:16.855
(SIGHS) I wish you
could spend the night.

11:16.889 --> 11:18.189
I don't think I could
make it through the night.

11:18.224 --> 11:21.059
All right, well, maybe some other time.

11:21.093 --> 11:24.229
Like maybe after a game when
you're really, really tired.

11:24.263 --> 11:27.932
I don't know, Grace, I don't
think I'm ever gonna be too tired.

11:27.967 --> 11:29.234
(CHUCKLES) Me neither.

11:29.268 --> 11:32.270
Oh, right. Uh, I'm gonna go.

11:43.983 --> 11:45.183
Goodnight. Goodnight.

11:49.922 --> 11:51.089
(SIGHS)

11:53.225 --> 11:54.859
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

11:56.862 --> 11:58.897
Where are you? I'm waiting for Ethan.

11:58.931 --> 12:00.899
He's talking to Kathy's grandmother.

12:00.933 --> 12:02.133
Kathy's not speaking to him.

12:02.168 --> 12:03.835
I'm not surprised.

12:03.869 --> 12:05.737
I still have to finish my paper tonight.

12:05.771 --> 12:06.905
Or you could just get up early.

12:06.939 --> 12:09.040
I think it's better if I stay
up all night at the library,

12:09.075 --> 12:11.709
go to my classes then
come home and crash.

12:11.744 --> 12:12.977
I'm going to ask Bunny if that's okay,

12:13.012 --> 12:14.746
if I can take the afternoon off.

12:14.780 --> 12:15.880
Bunny? Yeah.

12:15.915 --> 12:17.082
You're going to ask
Bunny if that's okay?

12:17.116 --> 12:19.017
Is there something wrong with that?

12:19.051 --> 12:21.152
Yeah, you weren't asking
me if that's okay with me.

12:21.187 --> 12:23.121
And it's not okay with me.

12:23.155 --> 12:25.156
I don't feel comfortable with
your staying out all night.

12:25.191 --> 12:27.058
Amy, you're going to have to trust me.

12:27.093 --> 12:28.760
I don't have to do anything.

12:28.794 --> 12:29.861
Anything like what?

12:30.830 --> 12:31.830
(DISCONNECTS)

12:34.900 --> 12:35.900
(SIGHS)

12:37.499 --> 12:37.499
+

12:45.408 --> 12:46.608
Just this.

12:50.580 --> 12:53.348
Cash, huh? I don't have any change.

12:53.383 --> 12:55.284
Can you wait while I run
up to the coffee shop?

12:55.318 --> 12:56.385
Yeah, I guess.

12:59.222 --> 13:01.089
Little credit problem? Hmm?

13:01.124 --> 13:02.558
Lots of people pay with
cash if they have bad credit.

13:02.592 --> 13:05.494
Bad credit? No. I have good credit.

13:05.528 --> 13:07.229
I have excellent credit.

13:07.263 --> 13:08.463
I just like to pay for things in cash

13:08.498 --> 13:10.432
so there are no surprises
at the end of the month.

13:10.466 --> 13:13.135
But that's none of your business.

13:13.169 --> 13:15.537
Sorry, I was just going
to offer to help you out.

13:15.572 --> 13:17.472
Oh. Well, I don't need your help.

13:17.507 --> 13:20.275
I get it. Sorry.

13:20.310 --> 13:23.512
I run my own business, I was
just thinking like an employer.

13:23.546 --> 13:26.114
I'm always thinking that
way, about jobs and money,

13:26.149 --> 13:27.349
who needs a job, who needs money.

13:27.383 --> 13:28.584
I don't need a job or money.

13:28.618 --> 13:31.320
All right, well,

13:31.354 --> 13:33.522
if you ever do need to
earn a little extra cash

13:33.556 --> 13:36.358
I may have something for you.

13:36.392 --> 13:39.428
Or we could just go out and get
to know each other a little better.

13:39.462 --> 13:41.597
You look like a smart
girl, and you're beautiful.

13:41.631 --> 13:44.433
I don't need a job and I
don't want to go out with you.

13:45.134 --> 13:46.335
Go away.

13:47.470 --> 13:48.470
Hard to get, huh?

14:00.249 --> 14:01.617
I'm coming, sorry.

14:01.651 --> 14:04.219
Yeah, look, you left me standing
out there with some creepy guy.

14:04.253 --> 14:07.255
What kind of guy do you find
creepy? I'm just curious.

14:07.290 --> 14:08.390
A guy who was offering me a job

14:08.424 --> 14:09.524
and trying to hit on
me at the same time.

14:09.559 --> 14:12.260
What kind of job? He didn't say.

14:12.295 --> 14:14.129
Are you okay? Did he scare you?

14:14.163 --> 14:16.164
No.

14:16.199 --> 14:18.300
Yeah. I got a bad feeling from him.

14:18.334 --> 14:20.102
Is he still down there? I don't know.

14:20.136 --> 14:21.403
Come on, I'll go with
you, I want to see him.

14:21.437 --> 14:23.438
Call the campus police and
tell them to walk over here.

14:31.314 --> 14:34.149
Hey, I thought you were
asked not to hang out in here.

14:34.183 --> 14:36.451
What? What'd I do?

14:36.486 --> 14:38.220
I'm just picking up a
book for my girlfriend.

14:38.254 --> 14:41.156
Don't you mean some props
for your girlfriends? Get out.

14:49.599 --> 14:52.234
Okay, what are you talking about?

14:52.268 --> 14:54.202
Who is that? A pimp. I suspect.

14:54.237 --> 14:55.237
Wait, a what?

14:55.271 --> 14:56.471
A guy who sells women to guys.

14:56.506 --> 14:58.507
He thought he was going
to sell me to guys?

14:58.541 --> 15:00.175
I'm going to...

15:00.209 --> 15:01.376
No, you're not going to do anything.

15:01.411 --> 15:03.245
Just leave it to the campus cops.

15:03.279 --> 15:05.480
That guy, other guys like him,

15:05.515 --> 15:08.116
show up around campus
every once in a while.

15:08.184 --> 15:09.484
They usually prey on freshmen,

15:09.519 --> 15:11.453
guys who just want to get laid

15:11.487 --> 15:13.121
or girls who are desperate

15:13.156 --> 15:15.257
and can barely get by on
their loans or whatever.

15:17.460 --> 15:20.195
Hey Bubba, we had an unwanted visitor.

15:20.229 --> 15:21.463
What variety? Pimp.

15:21.497 --> 15:24.166
I think he was in here
last year, I'm pretty sure.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.200
Either of you get a picture?

15:25.234 --> 15:26.334
No. No.

15:26.369 --> 15:29.104
Alright, I'll take a
look at the security tape.

15:32.375 --> 15:36.311
You know, I think I might just stick
around and have a cup of coffee.

15:36.345 --> 15:38.180
Yeah, do that.

15:38.214 --> 15:40.515
But we're closing in another hour
and Bubba will walk you to your car.

15:40.550 --> 15:42.551
Thanks. And what about you?

15:42.585 --> 15:44.286
I live on campus.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.288
He'll walk me to my dorm
or I'll call a friend.

15:46.589 --> 15:49.524
All right.

15:49.559 --> 15:52.527
And good for you for paying attention
to your gut feelings about that guy.

15:53.329 --> 15:54.529
Yeah.

15:58.501 --> 16:00.268
I knew you'd be here.

16:01.270 --> 16:02.504
I'm expected here.

16:02.538 --> 16:05.207
I don't think Dylan is expecting you.

16:05.241 --> 16:07.042
What, are you following
me now? I might be.

16:07.076 --> 16:09.111
Well go home before I call your daddy.

16:09.145 --> 16:11.480
Go ahead, call my dad. I don't care.

16:11.514 --> 16:14.249
Because nothing is going to
keep me from seeing Dylan.

16:15.384 --> 16:17.119
Except for maybe me.

16:18.121 --> 16:20.322
Hello. What are you doing here?

16:20.356 --> 16:22.457
Can't a guy stop by and
say hi to his girlfriend?

16:22.492 --> 16:24.159
Uh, she's not your girlfriend.

16:24.193 --> 16:25.360
Uh, she's not your girlfriend.

16:25.394 --> 16:27.529
I'm nobody's girlfriend,

16:27.563 --> 16:30.232
but my parents got delayed getting here

16:30.266 --> 16:32.100
and it's getting late and they asked if

16:32.135 --> 16:35.403
Henry wanted to come over and just
stay with me until they got here.

16:35.438 --> 16:37.405
So, goodnight, Ben.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.507
What?

16:38.541 --> 16:40.275
Cecilia and Robert trust me.

16:40.309 --> 16:42.344
Because unlike you, I'm trustworthy.

16:42.378 --> 16:44.546
And I don't have any secrets
or lies that I'm keeping.

16:44.580 --> 16:47.382
Well, of course not, everyone
knows you slept with Adrian.

16:47.416 --> 16:50.385
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, and no one
knows that you slept with Alice

16:50.419 --> 16:51.520
while you were leading Dylan on.

16:51.554 --> 16:54.222
Uh, excuse me?

16:54.257 --> 16:57.125
You slept with Alice
while we were dating?

16:57.160 --> 16:59.427
It was an accident.

16:59.462 --> 17:01.163
And it's very complicated.

17:01.197 --> 17:03.031
And how the hell did you find that out?

17:03.065 --> 17:04.299
How do you think?

17:12.474 --> 17:14.108
Alice.

17:15.310 --> 17:17.078
Let me just lock up and
we'll grab Bubba and go.

17:18.513 --> 17:20.415
Hey, am I too late?

17:22.084 --> 17:23.151
What are you doing here, Adrian?

17:23.185 --> 17:26.221
Oh, sorry. Am I in your way?

17:26.255 --> 17:28.190
Did you need to speak
to Clementine alone?

17:28.223 --> 17:30.091
I just wanted to get some coffee.

17:30.126 --> 17:31.526
I'm going to try to pull my
first all-nighter at the library.

17:32.495 --> 17:34.095
You ready, Miss Adrian?

17:34.130 --> 17:35.330
Yeah, I'm ready.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.166
Is he bothering you?

17:38.201 --> 17:40.168
No, he's not bothering me,

17:40.203 --> 17:41.436
but come back in five
minutes, all right?

17:41.470 --> 17:43.138
You got it.

17:47.210 --> 17:48.243
What the hell is going on?

17:48.277 --> 17:51.046
Oh, this creep hassled Adrian before.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.180
What kind of creep?

17:52.215 --> 17:54.149
Some pimp on a recruiting mission.

17:54.183 --> 17:56.051
What? It's a college campus.

17:56.085 --> 17:57.385
They know who their market is

17:57.420 --> 17:59.054
and they know young girls are vulnerable

17:59.088 --> 18:01.056
away from home for the first time

18:01.090 --> 18:03.391
and a lot of college girls need
money, so they prey on them.

18:03.426 --> 18:04.993
Did they arrest the guy?

18:05.061 --> 18:06.394
He didn't really do anything.

18:06.429 --> 18:09.064
They just chased him away and
they'll keep an eye out for him.

18:09.098 --> 18:10.999
Well, you're not walking
back to your dorm alone.

18:11.067 --> 18:13.068
Bubba will walk me. I can walk you.

18:13.102 --> 18:15.237
No, you go to the library.

18:15.271 --> 18:18.240
I don't want you to have to tell
Amy that you walked me to my dorm.

18:18.274 --> 18:20.041
I like Amy.

18:20.076 --> 18:21.476
I want Amy to like me.

18:21.510 --> 18:25.313
Bubba will take me over, he
does that a lot of nights anyway.

18:25.348 --> 18:27.482
I don't want to walk around
campus late at night by myself.

18:27.516 --> 18:29.117
Then I'll walk you with Bubba.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.318
Not necessary.

18:35.850 --> 18:35.850
+

18:37.428 --> 18:39.020
Thank you for finally
 picking up the phone.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.775
I'm picking it u up to tell
you to never call me again.

18:40.809 --> 18:42.476
Never? Never.

18:42.511 --> 18:44.578
But I was only looking
out for your best interest,

18:44.613 --> 18:45.746
for the baby's best interest.

18:45.781 --> 18:49.417
Uh, no. You were being a jerk,

18:49.451 --> 18:52.687
and you have no regard for me or
my baby or for my baby's parents.

18:52.721 --> 18:54.555
So do not call me again

18:54.589 --> 18:56.390
and do not try to talk to me at school

18:56.425 --> 18:58.326
or get to me by talking
to my grandmother.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.361
I wouldn't have talked to your
grandmother if you had talked to me.

19:00.395 --> 19:02.296
I don't want to talk to you!

19:02.331 --> 19:04.398
I'm really, really angry with you and...

19:04.433 --> 19:05.866
You know what?

19:05.901 --> 19:09.670
I don't think it's good for the
baby for me to be angry with anyone!

19:09.705 --> 19:11.339

19:17.346 --> 19:18.612
(DRAWER OPENS AND CLOSES)

19:22.651 --> 19:25.753
So I'm at the clinic,
as I told you I would be,

19:25.787 --> 19:29.457
and Ricky calls to
tell me he took you home

19:29.491 --> 19:32.426
but I didn't know you
left and neither did Shakur

19:32.461 --> 19:34.729
since apparently he'd
left on an emergency call.

19:36.565 --> 19:41.502
So you decided to go and
meet the adoptive couple

19:41.536 --> 19:43.671
when I told you that was not allowed?

19:45.474 --> 19:48.776
You ruined my night, Kathy's night,

19:48.810 --> 19:51.712
the adoptive couples' night,

19:51.747 --> 19:54.348
Kathy's grandmother's night,

19:54.383 --> 19:58.386
Ricky's night and
possibly the baby's life.

19:58.420 --> 19:59.553
The baby's life?

19:59.588 --> 20:01.756
What if the couple
backs out because of you?

20:01.790 --> 20:03.591
They're not going to back out,

20:03.625 --> 20:05.826
but I wish they would.

20:05.861 --> 20:08.662
Look, I don't think they're going
to make good parents. I don't.

20:08.697 --> 20:11.665
I have a sixth sense about
these things. I'm street smart.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.734
I know when people are bad people.

20:13.769 --> 20:15.436
These are bad people.

20:15.470 --> 20:20.408
He's the mayor of a small town.

20:20.442 --> 20:26.480
A small town that was voted
the best small town in America.

20:26.515 --> 20:29.450
Did your sixth sense tell you that?

20:29.484 --> 20:31.786
Did your sixth sense tell you that

20:31.820 --> 20:35.756
Jonathan has multiple advanced degrees

20:35.791 --> 20:40.895
and has won awards for developing
environmentally safe products?

20:40.929 --> 20:44.532
Did your sixth sense tell
you that the wife, Sonya,

20:44.566 --> 20:46.734
operates a day care for free

20:46.768 --> 20:48.903
for people that can't afford day care?

20:50.739 --> 20:54.642
You don't have a sixth sense.

20:54.676 --> 20:56.844
You don't even have any common sense.

20:56.878 --> 20:59.680
No one told me that stuff.

20:59.714 --> 21:01.782
And if Jonathan had allowed
me to keep asking questions,

21:01.817 --> 21:03.617
I'm sure I would have found that out.

21:03.652 --> 21:05.519
Sit down. (SIGHS)

21:07.556 --> 21:11.659
I told you this is not your decision.

21:13.428 --> 21:15.796
It is not your decision

21:15.831 --> 21:19.767
who adopts the baby or
if the baby is adopted.

21:19.801 --> 21:22.603
That's Kathy's decision.

21:22.637 --> 21:26.440
You don't get toto decide that
because you're her boyfriend.

21:26.475 --> 21:28.709
And I doubt that you are
her boyfriend anymore.

21:29.744 --> 21:31.846
And you want to know why, Ethan?

21:31.880 --> 21:33.881
You have no respect for her

21:33.915 --> 21:37.618
and you have no respect for me,

21:37.652 --> 21:40.788
because you didn't
listen to either of us.

21:40.822 --> 21:45.593
And if you ever want to have a
decent relationship with a girl,

21:45.927 --> 21:47.895
then you need to start

21:47.929 --> 21:51.732
by having a decent
relationship with your mother.

21:51.766 --> 21:54.001
For now, that would be me.

21:55.704 --> 21:59.740
You need too quit sneaking around

22:00.775 --> 22:03.844
and ignoring what I tell you to do.

22:03.879 --> 22:05.846
And show some respect.

22:05.881 --> 22:08.516
It's all about respect.

22:08.550 --> 22:09.850
I respect you.

22:11.753 --> 22:13.487
I'm afraid of you, anyway.

22:13.522 --> 22:15.589
You're not that afraid of me

22:15.624 --> 22:19.760
because you slipped out to
meet these people tonight

22:19.794 --> 22:21.896
when I told you not to do that.

22:21.930 --> 22:23.464
Kathy wanted me there.

22:24.733 --> 22:26.767
Okay, I wanted to be there.

22:26.801 --> 22:28.502
For her.

22:28.537 --> 22:29.703
And I asked her if I could go.

22:29.738 --> 22:32.439
Because you didn't
get your way last week.

22:32.474 --> 22:33.841
Because you can't live with "no."

22:35.544 --> 22:37.845
Learn to live with "no."

22:37.879 --> 22:41.615
You're going to be hearing "no."

22:41.650 --> 22:44.718
From me and from other
women in your life.

22:44.753 --> 22:46.587
So now hear this.

22:46.621 --> 22:49.690
No, you may not have your phone back.

22:49.724 --> 22:55.529
No, you may not approach Kathy
at school or anywhere else.

22:55.564 --> 22:59.500
No, you may not go
anywhere near that couple,

22:59.534 --> 23:01.502
not even to apologize.

23:01.536 --> 23:04.572
And no, you may not stay up
till all hours of the night

23:04.606 --> 23:07.841
trying to figure out how to get
me to change my mind. Go to bed.

23:07.876 --> 23:09.510
But... No!

23:11.713 --> 23:13.514
What, were you jealous
that I'm dating Dylan?

23:13.548 --> 23:16.650
Jealous that you were dating Dylan? No.

23:16.685 --> 23:18.586
But now I'm jealous that
Henry's dating Dylan.

23:18.620 --> 23:20.421
And the night I was with
you, I was still jealous

23:20.455 --> 23:22.423
and angry that Henry
had slept with Adrian.

23:22.457 --> 23:24.458
Oh, come on, you were not that angry.

23:24.492 --> 23:26.827
What we did was not revenge sex.

23:26.861 --> 23:29.430
It was stupid, careless
sex between friends

23:29.464 --> 23:32.466
on a crazy night when neither of
us were thinking about anything

23:32.500 --> 23:34.368
other than my going to jail.

23:34.402 --> 23:35.636
You were thinking about
that. I never believed that,

23:35.670 --> 23:37.805
that you would go to jail. And...

23:37.839 --> 23:40.674
Sorry. I wanted to get back at Henry

23:40.709 --> 23:45.446
and then I felt guilty about it,
really guilty, because it was wrong.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.649
I just have to accept
that Henry doesn't love me,

23:48.683 --> 23:50.618
and you have to accept
that Amy doesn't love you.

23:50.652 --> 23:53.387
She does love me. She
had to marry Ricky,

23:53.421 --> 23:56.423
just like I had to marry
Adrian. It's totally unfair.

23:56.458 --> 23:58.392
You need to go back to Dr. Fields.

23:59.828 --> 24:01.595
And you need a friend.

24:03.732 --> 24:06.433
Two friends even.

24:06.468 --> 24:08.769
We've got to apologize to
Henry, make it right somehow.

24:08.803 --> 24:11.538
What, and just give Dylan to him?

24:11.573 --> 24:12.773
What? She's not property.

24:12.807 --> 24:15.509
Well, I know that,

24:15.543 --> 24:16.744
but I still don't want him to have her.

24:16.778 --> 24:19.513
Even though you'd give her up
in a second for Amy Juergens.

24:19.547 --> 24:20.581
Yeah.

24:20.615 --> 24:22.650
Ugh.

24:22.684 --> 24:24.718
<i>Goodnight, Jack. JACK: Goodnight, Grace.</i>

24:24.753 --> 24:26.353
Are you going to sleep?

24:26.388 --> 24:27.688
I'm not ready for bed
yet, I'm wide awake.

24:27.722 --> 24:29.690
You better get some sleep,
you have practice tomorrow.

24:29.724 --> 24:31.725
I don't think I can sleep,
I'm still thinking about you.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.828
Aw! That's so nice.

24:34.863 --> 24:36.630
I'm still thinking about you, too.

24:36.665 --> 24:38.565
I'm still thinking about
having sex with you.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.634
Oh. Well, you should
stop thinking about that,

24:40.669 --> 24:42.536
'cause it's just going to
make you more frustrated.

24:42.570 --> 24:44.505
I can't. Yes, you can.

24:45.507 --> 24:47.441
Now, I have to get some sleep.

24:47.475 --> 24:48.809
I love you. Yeah, I love you.

24:48.843 --> 24:50.477
Don't say it like that.

24:50.512 --> 24:52.780
It's just... (SIGHS) Forget it.

24:52.814 --> 24:55.549
Oh, come on, it's fun not having sex.

24:55.583 --> 24:58.452
It's the anticipation
of it that's so exciting.

24:58.486 --> 25:00.654
Anticipation may not be my strong suit.

25:00.689 --> 25:02.756
Don't do anything
stupid, Jack, all right?

25:02.791 --> 25:04.725
Just because I forgave you
for sleeping with Clementine

25:04.759 --> 25:06.493
doesn't mean I'd forgive
you if you did it again.

25:06.528 --> 25:08.529
I'm not going to do anything stupid.

25:08.563 --> 25:10.397
Good. Yeah, all right. Goodnight.

25:10.432 --> 25:11.565
Goodnight.

25:11.599 --> 25:12.766
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

25:16.438 --> 25:18.539
Hey, buddy, you're missing out.

25:18.573 --> 25:20.407
The girls are here.
They're walking the halls.

25:20.442 --> 25:21.642
What girls? Party girls.

25:21.676 --> 25:23.744
There's a party? If
you've got the money.

25:25.380 --> 25:26.814
Uh, I don't think so.

+

25:32.623 --> 25:33.656
Yeah. I think he was.

25:33.691 --> 25:35.358
Did you get a picture of him?

25:35.392 --> 25:36.392
I didn't even understand
what he was doing

25:36.427 --> 25:38.595
until Clementine explained it to me.

25:38.629 --> 25:41.197
I just... I knew something was wrong.

25:41.232 --> 25:44.434
Anyway, he took off and
then the campus police came

25:44.468 --> 25:47.303
and I hung around with
Clementine for a little,

25:47.338 --> 25:49.639
and then a campus cop
walked me to my car.

25:49.673 --> 25:52.242
I couldn't shake the creepy feeling.

25:52.276 --> 25:53.643
(SIGHS) Geez, Adrian.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.379
Do you have any idea
how dangerous pimps are?

25:56.413 --> 25:58.381
It's never just sex involved,

25:58.415 --> 26:00.416
it's drugs, violence and
all kinds of other crimes.

26:00.451 --> 26:03.186
And yeah, that stuff
does exist on campus.

26:03.220 --> 26:04.320
I'm surprised you're so naive.

26:04.355 --> 26:05.455
Hey, don't insult me!

26:05.489 --> 26:06.523
Well, what were you
doing talking to this guy?

26:06.557 --> 26:08.491
He was at the bookstore!

26:08.526 --> 26:10.627
Quit trying to make this my
fault! I did nothing wrong!

26:10.661 --> 26:13.263
No. No, you didn't.

26:13.297 --> 26:15.632
I don't know where that
came from, I just got angry.

26:15.666 --> 26:17.267
I just want to kill these guys.

26:17.301 --> 26:18.668
The buyers or the sellers?

26:18.702 --> 26:21.271
Because if no one was buying,
there would be nothing to sell.

Come here.

26:26.544 --> 26:27.544
I'm staying over.

26:28.512 --> 26:30.480

26:30.514 --> 26:32.482
I think we should start
thinking about living together.

26:32.516 --> 26:34.517
I can't live with you because
I'm afraid to live alone.

26:34.552 --> 26:37.287

you love me and I love you?

No. I was watching the game.
What have you been doing?

27:06.183 --> 27:09.552
Talking to Tom about
that book. It's his.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.421
(SNICKERS) Tom's?

27:11.455 --> 27:14.424
Yeah. And now he's filled with a
bunch of really, really bad ideas

27:14.458 --> 27:16.226
about sex, and about women.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.293
I'll straighten him out.

Well, I don't know if you're any better.

Me? I'm not into that stuff,
I've got two daughters.

27:20.664 --> 27:22.298
You were reading the book.

27:22.333 --> 27:23.600
I thought you just left it
on the counter as a starter.

27:23.634 --> 27:26.369
No. I thought it was a cookbook

27:26.403 --> 27:28.204
till you started reading it aloud.

27:28.239 --> 27:29.439
All right, well, I'll talk to him.

27:29.473 --> 27:32.542
The bigger problem is Tom needs friends.

27:32.576 --> 27:34.510
You know what? He needs
someone to be his friend.

27:34.545 --> 27:36.179
You sound like you're
feeling sorry for him.

27:36.213 --> 27:37.547
(SIGHS) I am.

27:37.581 --> 27:39.515
Don't feel sorry for
Tom, he's a happy guy.

27:39.550 --> 27:41.551
He's got a lot on the
ball, he'll find someone.

27:41.585 --> 27:45.188
Yeah, until then I just don't want him
substituting porn for a relationship.

27:45.222 --> 27:47.123
You know, that was pretty
tame stuff he's reading,

27:47.157 --> 27:48.324
I think he'll be okay.

27:48.359 --> 27:50.293
If he starts looking
depressed or obsessing

27:50.327 --> 27:51.594
over those kind of
books, then you worry.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.496
And obviously, he doesn't see
anything wrong with that book

27:53.530 --> 27:55.131
or he wouldn't have just
left it in the kitchen.

27:55.165 --> 27:56.366
He's not hiding anything.

29:26.323 --> 29:29.459
then, again, they beat
the crap out of you.

29:29.493 --> 29:32.228
Listen, I'm running out of time, so...

29:32.262 --> 29:33.296
Is that what happened to you?

29:33.330 --> 29:35.598
I wasn't exactly on a date.

29:35.632 --> 29:38.434
I met a guy online playing a game.

29:38.469 --> 29:39.669
We liked the same game.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.338
I told him where I lived.

29:42.373 --> 29:44.374
He parked around the
corner from my house,

29:44.441 --> 29:46.642
told me to sneak out
and meet him. I did.

29:47.678 --> 29:48.711
He took off with me.

29:48.746 --> 29:51.481
How old are you? Twenty-one.

29:51.515 --> 29:53.282
No, you're not. How
old do you think I am?

29:53.317 --> 29:54.550
Sixteen maybe.

29:54.585 --> 29:55.718
Good guess.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.488
Come on. I got to go.

29:58.522 --> 30:00.390
Why don't you just stay and
we'll call the police, all right?

30:00.424 --> 30:02.658
You really are naive, aren't you?

30:02.693 --> 30:05.395
You call the police and he'll kill me.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.296
He'll get off and I'll be dead.

30:19.109 --> 30:19.109
+

30:20.768 --> 30:21.894
Morning.

30:24.232 --> 30:26.901
I went to class, there was a
sign on the door, it was canceled,

30:26.935 --> 30:28.936
I'm going to sleep until
the afternoon class.

30:31.006 --> 30:32.873
Where have you been?

30:32.908 --> 30:34.141
You know where I've been. I've
been in the library all night.

30:34.176 --> 30:35.710
You sure?

30:38.146 --> 30:40.047
You sure you weren't with Jack?

30:40.082 --> 30:43.684
(CHUCKLES) Um, no. I was not with
Jack. Why would I be with Jack?

30:43.719 --> 30:44.885
You know why you would be with Jack.

30:44.920 --> 30:47.054
Amy, I'm really tired. From what?

30:47.089 --> 30:50.825
From this conversation and from
staying up all night to write my paper.

30:50.859 --> 30:52.760
I wrote my paper. I'm
really happy with it,

30:52.794 --> 30:54.161
but I'm not happy coming home to this.

30:54.196 --> 30:56.097
I didn't know there were
hookers on your campus.

30:56.131 --> 30:57.898
Hmm? Oh, don't act like you don't know.

30:57.933 --> 31:00.835
No, I do know. I saw
Clementine last night and...

31:00.869 --> 31:03.104
Aha! So it wasn't a
prostitute, you were with her!

31:03.138 --> 31:04.872
No, I was not with her.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.974
I got coffee before I went
to the library, I texted you.

31:07.008 --> 31:08.142
And then what happened?

31:08.176 --> 31:09.810
A hooker came in for coffee?

31:09.845 --> 31:12.146
(CHUCKLES) What? No. But...

31:12.180 --> 31:16.684
Some g had been in the bookstore
earlier and he scared Adrian.

31:16.718 --> 31:19.787
And Clementine recognized him from
something that happened last year.

31:19.821 --> 31:22.123
Apparently he's a pimp or something

31:22.157 --> 31:24.091
so the campus police
walked Adrian to her car

31:24.126 --> 31:25.893
and walked Clementine to her dorm.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.828
You didn't put any of that in your text.

31:27.863 --> 31:29.864
Did you also walk
Clementine to her dorm?

31:29.898 --> 31:30.998
Yes.

31:36.138 --> 31:38.773
Why didn't you tell me that?

31:38.807 --> 31:41.809
Ricky, we've had sex practically
every day, isn't that enough for you?

31:41.843 --> 31:43.077
Amy, of course it is.

31:43.111 --> 31:45.012
There's nothing wrong
with our relationship,

31:45.046 --> 31:46.881
other than you're a little nuts.

31:46.915 --> 31:48.816
Well, I can't help it. You
shouldn't keep things from me.

31:48.850 --> 31:50.751
I was going to tell you
about walking her over,

31:50.786 --> 31:52.887
the cop was with us the whole time,

31:52.921 --> 31:54.021
but if I had told you that last night,

31:54.055 --> 31:55.890
you'd think I stayed
with her or something.

31:55.924 --> 31:57.725
Did you kiss her? No.

31:57.759 --> 32:00.861
I did not kiss her. And I
am not going to kiss her.

32:00.896 --> 32:01.962
Where is all this coming from?

32:10.038 --> 32:11.071
What?

32:33.829 --> 32:34.829
(SPITS)

32:49.010 --> 32:50.077
(GASPS)

32:50.879 --> 32:52.012
What?

32:55.183 --> 32:57.718
Oh. Mmm-mmm.

33:02.924 --> 33:05.893
Oh, ease tell me Ben is not
involved in this somehow.

33:14.169 --> 33:15.736
Let me see that.

33:15.770 --> 33:17.705
When I'm done with it.

33:17.739 --> 33:19.974
Jack? Jack is a Christian again?

33:20.008 --> 33:21.709
(SCOFFS)

33:21.743 --> 33:24.044
I don't know, but it's a good spin.

33:24.079 --> 33:26.146
Wow. "Wow" what?

33:26.181 --> 33:30.751
Fifteen-year-old-girl nabbed by
some guy, turned into a prostitute.

33:30.785 --> 33:32.786
She's been away from
her family for two years.

33:32.821 --> 33:34.989
So she liked it? Liked it?

33:35.023 --> 33:36.824
Are you that naive?

33:36.858 --> 33:38.759
Well, if she didn't like it,
why didn't she just go home?

33:38.793 --> 33:39.994
<i>Oy vey.</i>

33:40.028 --> 33:42.863
Because her pimp would
beat her up or kill her.

33:42.898 --> 33:44.965
What girl would like being a hooker?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.901
Uh... And don't say Betty.

33:47.802 --> 33:49.937
Betty was brutalized.

33:49.971 --> 33:52.072
I had no idea. That's
the story of your life.

33:53.108 --> 33:55.643
You really do have no idea.

33:55.677 --> 33:59.113
You have no idea of the indignities
and humiliation and intimidation

33:59.147 --> 34:01.115
and disrespect that women suffer

34:01.149 --> 34:03.851
because they're objectified by men.

34:03.885 --> 34:06.654
How did you ever get the
attitude that it was okay to

34:06.688 --> 34:09.723
have sex with women you
don't really care about,

34:09.757 --> 34:14.895
because, on some level, that's like
treating a woman as if she's property.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.931
You did not get that attitude from me.

34:16.965 --> 34:18.699
I haven't even had breakfast.

34:18.733 --> 34:20.833
Well, have some breakfast
and think about it.

34:20.869 --> 34:22.835
And then go apologize to Alice

34:22.871 --> 34:25.072
and then go apologize to Amy.

34:25.106 --> 34:26.940
Because, somehow, you seem to think

34:26.975 --> 34:29.143
because you were nice to
her while she was pregnant,

34:29.177 --> 34:32.947
because you even fell in love
with her while she was pregnant,

34:32.981 --> 34:35.783
that she belongs to
you. And she doesn't.

34:37.052 --> 34:38.719
Okay.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.864
Good morning, Tom.

34:50.899 --> 34:54.735
Good morning. I guess it's official.

34:54.768 --> 34:56.737
Jack is a Christian again.

34:56.771 --> 34:57.871
What are you talking about?

35:01.910 --> 35:03.110
(GROANS IN FRUSTRATION)

35:08.116 --> 35:09.950
Jack! I didn't do anything.

35:09.985 --> 35:13.654
Some pimp sent some prostitutes
into the athletic dorm.

35:13.688 --> 35:15.823
When the cop came, I told
him to help this girl.

35:15.857 --> 35:17.758
She was terrified she
was going to get killed.

35:17.792 --> 35:20.060
By you? What? No.

35:20.095 --> 35:22.129
And I swear, I didn't do anything.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.998
I was going to give her some money

35:24.032 --> 35:25.132
because she's required to
earn a certain amount of money

35:25.166 --> 35:26.934
or the guy would beat her up.

35:26.968 --> 35:28.769
She's 15, Grace, she's a kid.

35:28.803 --> 35:29.837
Oh.

35:29.871 --> 35:31.839
Look, you can read the
police report in the paper.

35:31.873 --> 35:33.674
I didn't do anything,

35:33.708 --> 35:36.977
other than learn what idiots people
are when it comes to this stuff.

35:37.012 --> 35:38.045
Myself included.

35:40.048 --> 35:41.682
All right, well, don't believe me.

35:41.716 --> 35:43.817
I've been up all night and
I got to go to practice.

35:44.853 --> 35:45.853
(DISCONNECTS)

35:48.790 --> 35:52.860
They make it sound like it's fun.

35:58.900 --> 36:00.000
All right. Come on, bud.

36:04.773 --> 36:08.242
Hey, we have to go. All right.

36:08.276 --> 36:11.045
Well, I don't want to leave
when I know you're upset with me.

36:11.079 --> 36:12.546
I think you're the one
who's upset with me.

36:12.580 --> 36:13.947
Well, I was upse

36:13.982 --> 36:15.916
I didn't want you to be gone all night.

36:17.685 --> 36:19.953
I didn't sleep well.

36:19.988 --> 36:22.656
And I hate myself
when I don't trust you.

36:22.690 --> 36:24.658
You're the best husband in the world.

36:24.692 --> 36:25.526
I'm not your husband.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.327
Yeah. We have to do .

36:27.362 --> 36:28.629
We are going to be
doing something about it.

36:28.663 --> 36:31.298
Yeah, and soon. My mom
got home last night.

36:31.332 --> 36:33.167
All right, well, let's
get the wedding going.

36:33.201 --> 36:34.468
I think we're cracking
under the pressure.

36:34.502 --> 36:36.603
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Sorry.

36:36.638 --> 36:39.173
I love you, Amy. I love you.

36:39.207 --> 36:40.441
Bye. Iave to go.

36:43.244 --> 36:44.411
Bye.

36:54.025 --> 36:54.025
+

37:19.385 --> 37:21.286
Waiting for me? Why, yes, I was.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.353
Should we go find Henry?

37:22.388 --> 37:23.521
I want to talk to you first.

37:23.556 --> 37:26.324
Oh? I apologize, Alice.

37:26.358 --> 37:29.327
I apologize for taking
advantage of you as a friend.

37:29.361 --> 37:31.596
And as a woman. Okay.

37:31.630 --> 37:34.499
I never should have suggested
that we do what we did.

37:34.533 --> 37:36.367
I don't know how much
talking was involved.

37:36.402 --> 37:38.503
Then we really should have
talked about it. I'm an ass.

37:38.537 --> 37:41.406
You are, but you're my friend,

37:41.440 --> 37:45.410
and I was an equal participant
for all the wrong reasons.

37:45.444 --> 37:47.278
So, still best friends?
If you'll have me.

37:50.416 --> 37:54.185
Well, well, well, if it's
not the two secret lovers.

37:54.220 --> 37:56.321
Okay, we deserve that, Henry.

37:56.355 --> 37:58.456
We really do.

37:58.490 --> 38:00.491
And I apologize for what happened,

38:00.526 --> 38:02.293
and I apologize for not telling you

38:02.328 --> 38:04.362
and for making it look
as if I was avoiding you

38:04.396 --> 38:05.563
because you slept with Adrian.

38:05.598 --> 38:07.265
What are you up to?

38:07.299 --> 38:09.634
He's up to, "the sooner we all
get over our mistakes, the better."

38:09.668 --> 38:11.603
Uh-huh.

38:11.637 --> 38:14.305
And if you want to go out with
Dylan, then all I have to say is

38:15.207 --> 38:16.307
may the best man win.

38:16.342 --> 38:17.609
Oh? You think Dylan
would ever go out with you

38:17.643 --> 38:19.577
now that she knows about
you sleeping with Alice

38:19.612 --> 38:20.645
while you were going out with her?

38:20.679 --> 38:22.447
You told her? I wasn't going to,

38:22.481 --> 38:23.648
I didn't on our first date.

38:23.682 --> 38:25.283
I was going to take the high road.

38:25.317 --> 38:27.218
And then you didn't. But then I didn't.

38:28.487 --> 38:29.621
So game on.

38:33.325 --> 38:35.593
Excuse me, do you not get
what objectifying women means?

38:44.336 --> 38:46.170
Hey, how are you this morning?

38:46.205 --> 38:48.606
Oh, I didn't have a good night.

38:48.641 --> 38:51.242
Did you see this morning's paper? Yes.

38:51.277 --> 38:53.211
So there are prostitutes on campus.

38:53.245 --> 38:56.180
So what?

38:56.215 --> 38:58.283
Ricky's not interested in
them. No, I'm sure he's not.

38:58.317 --> 39:00.184
Are you being a smart ass?

39:00.219 --> 39:03.421
No, no. I meant that. I'm sure that
Ricky is happy being married to you.

39:03.455 --> 39:06.591
Why is that? Why are you so sure?

39:06.625 --> 39:08.259
And why is it any of your business?

39:08.294 --> 39:11.262
Okay, look. This isn't
going the way I hoped. Um...

39:11.297 --> 39:13.231
I just wanted to say that

39:13.265 --> 39:17.502
Amy, I'm sorry about the way I've acted.

39:17.536 --> 39:22.407
I should have let go of the fantasy
of ever being with you years ago,

39:22.441 --> 39:25.643
and, uh, now I really have to
because I'm wrecking my entire life.

39:26.645 --> 39:28.413
All right. But, um...

39:29.581 --> 39:31.282
Maybe in another life.

39:31.317 --> 39:33.384
Ben. All right, never.

39:34.219 --> 39:35.720
I just meant that...

39:35.754 --> 39:39.257
I apologize for this notion I've had
that you should have belonged to me.

39:39.291 --> 39:40.425
You belong to Ricky.

39:40.459 --> 39:44.195
Well, I don't belong to
anyone. I'm married to Ricky.

39:44.229 --> 39:45.496
That's what I meant.
Belong was the wrong word.

39:45.531 --> 39:47.332
Yeah, wrong word.

39:47.366 --> 39:49.600
So it really is over. It's
been over for quite a while.

39:49.635 --> 39:51.202
I know. Sorry.

39:51.236 --> 39:52.470
It's okay.

39:52.504 --> 39:55.373
Look, let's not make
this weird or anything,

39:55.407 --> 39:57.442
I'm still your friend,
you're still my friend.

39:57.476 --> 39:59.477
No, let's not do that.

39:59.511 --> 40:01.679
I can't do that.

40:01.714 --> 40:04.315
Let's not be friends, not for a while.

40:05.317 --> 40:06.684
Not for years even.

40:06.719 --> 40:08.386
Okay.

40:09.688 --> 40:11.556
Whatever you need to do,

40:12.658 --> 40:16.327
because, Ben,

40:16.362 --> 40:19.464
you're, like, a really nice guy

40:19.498 --> 40:21.432
and if caring about
me wrecked your life,

40:21.467 --> 40:23.634
then I'm really sorry.

40:32.578 --> 40:34.612
So, Ben.

40:34.646 --> 40:37.315
Henry and I had a very
nice time last night

40:37.349 --> 40:39.617
and if you would like to
counter by asking me out,

40:39.651 --> 40:41.552
you may do so. Would you like to go out?

40:41.587 --> 40:44.622
I am free from any former entanglements

40:44.656 --> 40:47.558
that may have kept me from giving our
relationship the attention I should have.

40:47.593 --> 40:49.427
My parents still won't let me.

40:53.332 --> 40:54.732
Otherwise, the answer
would have been yes.

40:59.571 --> 41:00.571
(CHUCKLES)

41:04.710 --> 41:06.477
Did you get kicked off the team?

41:06.512 --> 41:09.447
No, I didn't, but any of the
guys that participated in any way

41:09.481 --> 41:11.449
got suspended or kicked off the team.

41:11.483 --> 41:13.284
The ones that participated on a level

41:13.318 --> 41:15.353
that got them arrested,
got kicked off the team.

41:15.387 --> 41:17.722
But you're not suspended or anything,
right? What are you doing here?

41:17.756 --> 41:19.590
The word "Christian" in the headline

41:19.625 --> 41:21.726
is causing too much
attention to me on the field,

41:21.760 --> 41:24.295
so the coach told me to
take off and talk to you.

41:24.329 --> 41:26.364
Oh. Well, I like that coach.

41:26.398 --> 41:28.366
I do, too. And I like you.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.367
Why's that?

41:29.401 --> 41:31.269
Because you care about me,

41:31.303 --> 41:33.538
and you care about
doing the right thing,

41:33.572 --> 41:35.540
and people that care about
doing the right thing,

41:35.574 --> 41:38.276
respect themselves and
respect other people.

41:39.445 --> 41:42.346
So I want to apologize for being a jerk,

41:42.381 --> 41:44.248
for sleeping with other women,

41:44.283 --> 41:47.618
for trying to push you to do
something you didn't want to do,

41:47.653 --> 41:49.454
and I'm going to be a better man.

42:06.538 --> 42:07.638
So, you're not speaking to me?

42:10.342 --> 42:11.642
I didn't think you were speaking to me.

42:11.677 --> 42:14.445
I looked at you, I know
you saw me look at you.

42:14.480 --> 42:17.415
You told me not to speak to you at
school, and I respect what you say.

42:17.449 --> 42:18.516
Since when?

42:18.550 --> 42:20.685
Since my mother what a jerk I am.
