Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.954 --> 00:06.923
(cheering)

00:06.923 --> 00:09.426
(static hissing)

00:09.426 --> 00:10.794
NORM: Hey, wow, Sammy!

00:10.794 --> 00:12.212
Woody, Woody, Woody, jump up there

00:12.212 --> 00:13.213
and fix the TV. again, will you?

00:13.213 --> 00:14.214
(patrons complaining)

00:18.218 --> 00:19.219
Whoa, whoa!

00:19.219 --> 00:20.220
Perfect, Perfect!

00:20.220 --> 00:21.221
Don't move!

00:23.106 --> 00:25.025
Oh, wait a second,
Woody-- uh, just a...

00:25.025 --> 00:27.027
just a minor adjustment.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.030
SAM: That's it!

00:30.030 --> 00:35.035
Oh, I sure hope this game
doesn't go into overtime.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.872
(piano plays)

00:38.872 --> 00:41.324
? Making your way in the world today ?

00:41.324 --> 00:44.327
? Takes everything you've got ?

00:44.327 --> 00:47.330
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

00:47.330 --> 00:50.333
? Sure would help a lot ?

00:50.333 --> 00:55.722
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

00:55.722 --> 00:58.508
? Sometimes you want to go ?

00:58.508 --> 01:03.513
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:03.513 --> 01:08.518
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:08.518 --> 01:11.020
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:11.020 --> 01:13.523
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:13.523 --> 01:19.028
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:19.028 --> 01:21.531
? You want to go where people know ?

01:21.531 --> 01:24.033
? People are all the same ?

01:24.033 --> 01:28.037

everybody knows your name. ?

01:47.891 --> 01:49.392
Sam, here's your change.

01:49.392 --> 01:50.393
Oh, thank you.

01:50.393 --> 01:52.395
Oh, dear.

01:52.395 --> 01:53.897
What?

01:53.897 --> 01:57.734
I can't remember whether
or not I left my stove on.

01:57.734 --> 01:59.686
Oh, boy.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.988
No, it's off.

02:01.988 --> 02:03.823
A-ha. I think.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.610
It's off. Of course it's off.

02:07.610 --> 02:09.496
It's on. My apartment's on fire.

02:11.197 --> 02:11.998
Still...

02:11.998 --> 02:12.999
Go, go, go, go, go.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.834
Oh, wait, uh, before you go,

02:14.834 --> 02:16.836
uh, while you were
up there at Melville's

02:17.337 --> 02:18.838
a Madame Likova called.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.591
Something about showing up tonight

02:21.591 --> 02:23.259
with, uh, a videotape and analysis?

02:23.259 --> 02:25.512
Here? Madame Likova? Yeah.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.347
Well, we've got to get
this place cleaned up.

02:27.847 --> 02:28.598
Everyone, out!

02:29.799 --> 02:32.218
What's the big deal? Who is she?

02:32.218 --> 02:34.721
What?

02:34.721 --> 02:36.222
Well, she...

02:36.222 --> 02:40.727
Promise me, all of you, that
you won't make fun of me.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.612
Yeah, right.

02:42.612 --> 02:44.397
Hey... Carla, come on.

02:44.397 --> 02:47.283
No, we, uh, we won't make
fun of you, we promise.

02:49.736 --> 02:51.237
I've been studying ballet.

02:51.237 --> 02:54.290
(laughing)

02:54.290 --> 02:56.292
Sam!

02:56.292 --> 02:58.161
You laughed.

02:58.161 --> 03:00.914
No, no, we just, uh,
all thought of a joke.

03:02.081 --> 03:03.800
What joke?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.385
You in a tutu.

03:07.554 --> 03:08.504
Come on. What is this?

03:09.005 --> 03:10.506
Come on. Tell us all about it.

03:10.506 --> 03:13.009
Madame Likova has been visiting Boston

03:13.009 --> 03:15.762
and she consented to teach
a class at the college.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.313
On a caprice,

03:17.313 --> 03:19.599
I decided to enroll and I was accepted.

03:19.599 --> 03:23.486
Our final session entailed doing
a solo performance on videotape.

03:23.486 --> 03:25.405
Oh, I get it--
that way she could

03:25.405 --> 03:27.156
puke in the privacy of her own home.

03:27.156 --> 03:29.826
NORM: Diane, uh,

03:29.826 --> 03:32.161
why the sudden interest in ballet?

03:32.161 --> 03:34.447
Oh, Norman, it's not sudden.

03:34.447 --> 03:37.450
I've had an on-again,
off-again love affair

03:37.450 --> 03:41.337
with the ballet since
I was seven years old.

03:42.505 --> 03:44.874
I studied for a while, then gave it up.

03:45.375 --> 03:46.376
Regrettably, of course.

03:46.376 --> 03:50.263
Although I was blessed
with a swan-like neck

03:50.263 --> 03:51.965
and natural grace...

03:53.683 --> 03:57.053
I abandoned my dream of
becoming a prima ballerina

03:57.053 --> 04:00.440
and concentrated instead
on my career as a novelist.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.860
Which explains why you're
here in a bar pushing beers.

04:07.864 --> 04:11.651
Oh, I remember the first time
I ever put on my toe shoes...

04:11.651 --> 04:13.653
Excuse me, Diane. Isn't
your apartment on fire?

04:13.653 --> 04:15.154
Oh, my God!

04:15.154 --> 04:16.906
I completely forgot!

04:16.906 --> 04:18.291
My poor kitty.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.791
Wait a minute.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.295
I'm sure I turned it off.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.797
(sizzling noise)

04:24.797 --> 04:25.798
(coughing)

04:25.798 --> 04:27.300
(meowing)

04:30.303 --> 04:31.304
Hi, Cliff.

04:31.304 --> 04:32.305
Hey, Diane. Hi, everybody.

04:32.305 --> 04:33.806
Sammy? Hey!

04:33.806 --> 04:36.676
Mind if I put one of these up
on the old, uh, bulletin board?

04:36.676 --> 04:37.894
Go ahead.

04:37.894 --> 04:40.680
Ah, better take this old
one of mine down, huh?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.181
Boy, oh, boy, nobody was interested

04:42.181 --> 04:45.184
in my singles potluck sÃ©ance.

04:47.070 --> 04:49.188
What's going up this time?

04:49.188 --> 04:50.523
Well, you know, for years

04:50.523 --> 04:52.525
I've been saving up
and, uh, finally made it.

04:52.525 --> 04:55.411
I bought myself a snazzy
Italian sports car.

04:55.411 --> 04:56.663
Yup.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.164
As of tomorrow I'm going to be the owner

04:58.164 --> 04:59.415
of a brand new Alfredo.

04:59.415 --> 05:01.250
Hey, all right.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.119
But first I got to, uh,

05:03.119 --> 05:04.871
sell off the old Cliff-mobile.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.205
Wait a minute.

05:06.205 --> 05:09.459
Now you own a 1965 Chevy
station wagon, right?

05:09.459 --> 05:10.626
Yes, sir.

05:10.626 --> 05:12.428
This is a picture of a Rolls-Royce.

05:12.428 --> 05:13.296
What are you doing?

05:13.296 --> 05:16.099
Uh, read the copy there, Sammy.

05:16.099 --> 05:19.435
"Chevy, the Rolls-Royce
of station wagons."

05:19.435 --> 05:20.937
Oh, come on.

05:20.937 --> 05:22.939
Smart.

05:24.941 --> 05:26.442
Um, ex... excuse me.

05:26.442 --> 05:27.443
SAM: Yeah?

05:27.443 --> 05:30.196
I'm looking for Diane Chambers.

05:30.196 --> 05:31.481
Oh, she's not here right now.

05:31.481 --> 05:33.983
Oh, I'll bet you, you're
Madame Lik... Likova.

05:33.983 --> 05:35.401
Oh! Oh, goodness no.

05:35.401 --> 05:36.903
No.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.706
How Madame would laugh
if she heard you say that.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.375
And then she would strike me.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.579
No, I, I am Leeza, her assistant.

05:46.579 --> 05:47.580
Oh, Sam Malone, hi.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.581
Hello. Hello.

05:48.581 --> 05:49.582
Frasier Crane.

05:49.582 --> 05:50.466
Hello.

05:50.466 --> 05:51.417
Uh, well, is Madame

05:51.417 --> 05:52.418
going to come here

05:52.418 --> 05:53.920
later on tonight?

05:53.920 --> 05:57.423
Oh, no, no, Madame Likova
would never come to a tavern.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.175
No, I am bringing by

05:59.175 --> 06:01.094
the tape and analysis for Diane.

06:01.594 --> 06:04.097
Normally the students
pick them up themselves,

06:04.097 --> 06:10.853
but, well, Madame Likova
can be very... harsh,

06:10.853 --> 06:13.523
so I wanted to soften the blow

06:13.523 --> 06:15.324
by bringing them here myself.

06:15.324 --> 06:16.576
Her dancing's that bad, huh?

06:16.576 --> 06:18.578
I am afraid so.

06:19.078 --> 06:23.082
That is why I, I, I
wanted to come here myself

06:23.082 --> 06:26.953
and, and tell her not to dance anymore.

06:26.953 --> 06:30.206
Uh, but I, I have to go now.

06:30.206 --> 06:32.208
Uh, we are checking out tonight.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.210
And an impatient Madame Likova

06:34.210 --> 06:35.711
is a dangerous Madame Likova.

06:35.711 --> 06:37.463
Oh.

06:37.463 --> 06:41.267
Uh, give her this
videotape and this envelope

06:41.267 --> 06:43.770
and tell her I'm so sorry.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.772
Well, I will. Thank you very much.

06:45.772 --> 06:46.722
Yes, thank you.

06:46.722 --> 06:47.723
Do Svidaniya.

06:47.723 --> 06:49.692
"Do Svidaniya", huh?

06:49.692 --> 06:52.195
Those Russkies can never leave

06:52.195 --> 06:55.698
without slipping in
some Soviet propaganda.

06:55.698 --> 06:57.700
Hey, you guys think, uh, Diane

06:57.700 --> 06:59.569
is really that bad of a dancer?

06:59.569 --> 07:01.487
CARLA: I don't know.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.991
Guess there's no way of
ever knowing, is there?

07:04.991 --> 07:07.994
Yeah, none that I can really think of.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.912
CLIFF: Me, uh, neither.

07:09.912 --> 07:11.297
And who knows if that VCR

07:11.297 --> 07:12.665
in Sammy's office even works, you know?

07:14.383 --> 07:15.635
There's, uh, there's only one way

07:15.635 --> 07:17.136
to find out, you know. How's that?

07:17.136 --> 07:19.005
Get a tape and, uh,
slip it right in there.

07:19.005 --> 07:19.972
Talk about luck.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.341
Here's a tape right here.

07:24.093 --> 07:26.012
That's extremely insensitive.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.013
No, it's not. No, it's not.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.514
It's like driving by
the scene of an accident.

07:28.514 --> 07:29.515
You don't want to look,

07:29.515 --> 07:31.517
but you just can't help yourself.

07:31.517 --> 07:35.521
Yeah, and in this case you get
to play it over and over again.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.525
(piano playing)

07:39.525 --> 07:40.910
Is it working?

07:40.910 --> 07:41.661
(laughing)

07:41.661 --> 07:42.662
Guess so.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.664
Hey, that's Miss Chambers.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.165
Oh, boy.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.167
Why is she hopping around like that?

07:48.167 --> 07:49.669
Well, she's dancing, Woody.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.120
Get out!

07:53.506 --> 07:55.424
I don't know, guys.

07:55.424 --> 07:56.926
You know, maybe this isn't funny.

07:56.926 --> 07:59.428
Sam, are you looking at the screen?

07:59.428 --> 08:01.430
I-I-I'm sorry.
I'm just...

08:01.430 --> 08:04.433
(groaning, complaining)

08:04.433 --> 08:06.435
Being laughed at is
going to be the least

08:06.435 --> 08:07.436
of Diane's worries.

08:07.436 --> 08:08.938
If she ever reads this analysis,

08:08.938 --> 08:09.939
she's going to be shattered.

08:09.939 --> 08:11.440
Take a look at this thing.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.441
Oh, boy.

08:12.942 --> 08:14.443
"Poor, poor,

08:14.443 --> 08:16.395
poor, terrible..."

08:16.395 --> 08:20.867
Ooh, how was her attendance?

08:20.867 --> 08:22.368
What... I mean, what are we gonna do?

08:22.368 --> 08:24.871
She thinks her teacher's
going to show up tonight.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.372
Uh, what are we going to tell her?

08:26.372 --> 08:28.741
We're not going to tell her anything.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.076
Madame Likova is going

08:30.576 --> 08:32.078
to write her a splendid analysis.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.578
Can I borrow your office?

08:33.578 --> 08:34.964
Oh, hey, now wait a second now.

08:34.964 --> 08:36.916
Do you think this is
the right way to do it?

08:36.916 --> 08:38.417
Oh, listen, what harm can it do?

08:38.417 --> 08:39.919
I mean, she said this
was a one-shot deal.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.671
Why not let her leave it a winner?

08:41.671 --> 08:44.006
Uh, why would you, her favorite doormat,

08:44.006 --> 08:47.009
want to make her feel
better about herself?

08:47.009 --> 08:48.427
Oh, I hear what you're saying.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.930
Yeah, sure, she mocked me, debased me,

08:50.930 --> 08:54.433
humiliated me, ridiculed me,
finally left me at the altar,

08:54.433 --> 08:57.937
but you never really can
forget your first love, can you?

09:05.494 --> 09:07.330
Back again.

09:07.330 --> 09:09.282
And you'll all be happy to know

09:09.282 --> 09:10.283
that my oven was off.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.284
Ah!

09:11.284 --> 09:13.169
But I had left the milk out,

09:13.169 --> 09:14.670
so it wasn't a wasted trip.

09:16.172 --> 09:17.540
Uh, Diane,

09:17.540 --> 09:20.209
while you were out,
your, uh, dance teacher's

09:20.209 --> 09:21.510
assistant came by.

09:21.510 --> 09:23.462
Oh, poo.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.464
Madame Likova didn't come?

09:25.464 --> 09:29.885
No, no, uh, she got hold
of a bad bowl of borscht.

09:29.885 --> 09:31.387
Uh...

09:31.387 --> 09:35.391
but she, she, uh, told us
to make sure you got this.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.312
Here it is.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.813
Yeah.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.316
The moment of truth.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.700
Mm...

09:46.986 --> 09:48.371
Oh, I can't.

09:48.371 --> 09:49.789
Oh, oh, come on.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.041
You, you're going to
have to open it sometime.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.332
"Technique: very good.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.833
"Strength: very good.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.336
"Emotional response: outstanding.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.671
Flexibility: average"?

10:05.671 --> 10:08.674
Well, I always thought
I was very flexible.

10:10.676 --> 10:14.063
"Excellent natural instincts."

10:18.567 --> 10:20.569
"Soul of a dancer."

10:21.937 --> 10:24.407
"If not for the late start,

10:24.407 --> 10:26.776
could have had a career in dance."

10:26.776 --> 10:29.078
Oh, my.

10:29.078 --> 10:30.363
Oh, I'd love to call her and thank her.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.864
Maybe I can still
catch her at the hotel.

10:31.864 --> 10:34.617
Oh, no, no, Diane, I don't
think that's a good idea at all.

10:34.617 --> 10:36.285
Why not?

10:36.285 --> 10:39.088
Why not...?

10:39.088 --> 10:40.589
Why not?

10:40.589 --> 10:43.509
Because, uh, because...

10:43.509 --> 10:47.013
Well, uh, you know,
she's probably packing

10:47.013 --> 10:48.514
and if you disturb her right now,

10:48.514 --> 10:51.017
she'd probably put, uh, her,
her work clothes in one bag

10:51.017 --> 10:53.019
and her regular stuff in another bag.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.021
Then if the airline
lost one of those bags,

10:55.021 --> 10:57.523
then she, you know,
either she wouldn't be able

10:57.523 --> 11:01.027
to work or she'd look real
goofy out there on the street.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.029
That's why not.

11:03.029 --> 11:06.399
Is there something
you're not telling me?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.200
No! Ha! No.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.702
We're just, uh...

11:09.702 --> 11:11.070
What are we doing here?

11:11.070 --> 11:15.825
Uh, well, we're, ha,
we're horsing around.

11:15.825 --> 11:17.209
Horsing around, huh?

11:17.209 --> 11:19.078
(laughing)

11:19.078 --> 11:19.962
FRASIER: No, listen.

11:19.962 --> 11:20.913
The fact is we're all just

11:20.913 --> 11:22.415
thrilled to death about the report.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.917
Now you go ahead and call
her. I'm out of here, fellas.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.921
Sit.

11:31.924 --> 11:33.309
Ah, yes, Madame Likova, please.

11:33.309 --> 11:34.560
Oh, boy...

11:35.928 --> 11:37.646
DIANE: Oh, I see.

11:37.646 --> 11:38.814
She's busy, huh?

11:38.814 --> 11:40.766
Well, maybe...

11:40.766 --> 11:43.652
Oh, Madame Likova!

11:54.363 --> 11:56.282
Madame Likova!

11:56.282 --> 11:57.783
Yes, yes.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.568
This is Diane Chambers.

11:59.568 --> 12:02.538
I'm, I'm so glad I caught you.

12:02.538 --> 12:05.541
I...

12:05.541 --> 12:07.543
Yes. Yes, Madame Likova.

12:07.543 --> 12:09.044
I read it. I...

12:09.044 --> 12:10.913
Did you really mean everything you said?

12:12.465 --> 12:13.749
Ah, yes, I'm sorry.

12:13.749 --> 12:16.252
I know you always mean what you say.

12:16.252 --> 12:17.253
(line disconnects, dial tone buzzes)

12:17.253 --> 12:18.254
Hello?

12:20.756 --> 12:22.675
She hung up.

12:22.675 --> 12:26.679
Well, she was never one to chat.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.431
This is unbelievable.

12:28.431 --> 12:29.765
Mmm.

12:29.765 --> 12:31.150
I never thought I was this good.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.853
Maybe I've been too critical of myself.

12:33.853 --> 12:36.605
I really don't think that's possible.

12:36.605 --> 12:39.859
I must view my tape again--
through Madame's eyes.

12:39.859 --> 12:42.278
Would any of you mind, if...?

12:42.278 --> 12:43.279
Mind?

12:43.279 --> 12:45.281
We'd be angry if you didn't.

12:48.284 --> 12:49.785
Oh, my friends.

12:55.174 --> 12:59.261
I'm, I'm so glad you're all here
to share this moment with me.

13:01.096 --> 13:02.598
I tell you what.

13:02.598 --> 13:04.099
What don't you come and stand

13:04.600 --> 13:06.101
right up close to the television here?

13:06.101 --> 13:07.102
Oh, okay.

13:07.102 --> 13:09.104
So you get the best possible viewing,

13:09.104 --> 13:10.606
and we'll just sort of surround you

13:10.606 --> 13:13.108
behind you so we don't
distract you, all right?

13:13.108 --> 13:14.109
CARLA: Hit it!

13:14.109 --> 13:16.862
(piano playing)

13:18.647 --> 13:22.151
Yes, yes. Look at me.

13:22.151 --> 13:26.455
(muffled laughter)

13:26.455 --> 13:31.577
Ever since I was a child,
I wanted to dance so badly.

13:31.577 --> 13:33.913
Ooh, looks like you got your wish.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.595
Norman, don't you think it's time

13:49.595 --> 13:50.980
you got home to your beloved?

13:50.980 --> 13:54.400
No, no, it's, uh, Vera's
night to howl tonight.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.769
She's, uh, hosting a Tupperware party.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.571
I'd say, uh,

13:58.571 --> 14:00.072
right about now they're
probably knee-deep

14:00.072 --> 14:01.440
in lettuce crispers.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.778
Vera's really into Tupperware?

14:05.778 --> 14:06.779
Are you kidding?

14:06.779 --> 14:09.081
She wants to be buried
in one of those things.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.918
I can just, uh, see the service.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.920
You know, they lower
you into the ground,

14:14.920 --> 14:15.921
somebody burps the corner

14:15.921 --> 14:19.875
and you're sealed fresh
for eternity, I guess.

14:22.177 --> 14:23.929
Oh...

14:25.681 --> 14:28.100
Was that a sigh, Diane?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.019
I don't know.

14:30.519 --> 14:33.022
Come on. What's the matter? Come on.

14:33.022 --> 14:35.391
Nothing. You mentioned eternity, and...

14:35.391 --> 14:37.309
it got me to thinking.

14:39.311 --> 14:42.815
"For of all the sad
words of tongue or pen,

14:42.815 --> 14:47.319
The saddest are these:
It might have been."

14:47.319 --> 14:49.455
Yeah.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.294
I wonder what might have happened

14:55.294 --> 14:56.795
if I had pursued my dream.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.966
Who knows?

15:00.966 --> 15:03.469
I might have ended up an
accomplished ballerina.

15:06.889 --> 15:07.890
Now I'll never know.

15:07.890 --> 15:10.843
Yeah, that is tough, but, uh, well,

15:10.843 --> 15:13.345
that's what you get for dreaming.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.850
Didn't you ever have a dream, Norman?

15:17.850 --> 15:20.769
No.

15:20.769 --> 15:23.022
Not at all? Nope.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.990
You never wanted something
that was out of reach?

15:24.990 --> 15:28.661
Well, uh... beer nuts.

15:32.831 --> 15:36.669
Norman, I'm serious.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.455
So am I. Could you just...

15:39.455 --> 15:40.456
Yeah.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.710
Everyone has dreams, Norman.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.462
Everyone except me.

15:46.462 --> 15:47.796
I learned

15:47.796 --> 15:49.298
early in life not to have 'em.

15:49.298 --> 15:50.182
Oh...

15:50.182 --> 15:52.184
Yeah! I figure they're useless.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.185
They don't come true anyway.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.687
Norman...

15:54.687 --> 15:56.188
Yeah, life's tough enough

15:56.188 --> 15:58.190
without getting yourself all worked up

15:58.190 --> 16:00.192
over something that's not gonna happen.

16:00.192 --> 16:01.193
Mm-mm.

16:01.193 --> 16:04.697
Dreams-- they just
give you heartache.

16:06.949 --> 16:09.451
But isn't the real heartache

16:09.451 --> 16:11.453
knowing that you had the
potential to do something

16:11.453 --> 16:12.955
and you never tried?

16:12.955 --> 16:14.790
Listen to me.

16:14.790 --> 16:15.958
Listen to me!

16:15.958 --> 16:19.078
Do I have another choice?

16:19.078 --> 16:21.330
I have the potential to be a dancer.

16:21.830 --> 16:24.833
I still have a fighting chance
to make my dream come true.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.470
I'm gonna send my tape to Boston Ballet.

16:28.470 --> 16:30.172
You know... In fact, I am

16:30.556 --> 16:32.141
going to drop it in the mail tonight.

16:32.141 --> 16:33.142
I, uh...

16:33.142 --> 16:34.143
Oh, Norman...

16:34.143 --> 16:35.144
Diane?

16:35.144 --> 16:38.147
Oh, this is so wonderful. Well...

16:38.147 --> 16:40.149
Thank you so much. (smooches)

16:40.149 --> 16:41.150
Um...

16:41.150 --> 16:43.068
I'm too excited to stick around.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.570
Anyway, you know how to
lock up, right, Norman?

16:44.570 --> 16:45.938
You kidding? I'm the one who taught you.

16:46.438 --> 16:47.940
Right.

16:47.940 --> 16:48.941
Good night.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.442
Yeah.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.446
Well.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.949
Ah, alone in a bar.

17:02.955 --> 17:03.956
Maybe Diane is right.

17:04.455 --> 17:05.958
I guess dreams can come true.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.969
Hello, everyone.

17:16.969 --> 17:17.970
My!

17:20.355 --> 17:22.724
Don't you look the ballerina.

17:22.724 --> 17:23.726
Thank you, Carla.

17:23.726 --> 17:26.729
Now, why don't you take a flying leap?

17:27.730 --> 17:29.732
Sam, the reason I came early

17:30.232 --> 17:32.735
was to tell you that I'm
going to be a little late.

17:32.735 --> 17:34.737
You're not early. You're right on time.

17:34.737 --> 17:37.740
Oh. Well, then, I'm
going to be quite late.

17:37.740 --> 17:40.242
I'm auditioning for Boston Ballet.

17:40.242 --> 17:41.627
Would you mind

17:41.627 --> 17:42.995
if I warmed up?

17:43.495 --> 17:45.998
This seems a tad high, but
it might serve as a barre.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.501
Well, it is a bar, Miss Chambers.

17:49.501 --> 17:52.004
No, Woody, when a dancer warms up,

17:52.004 --> 17:54.389
they hold onto a barre.

17:54.389 --> 17:57.092
That is a bar.

17:57.092 --> 18:00.012
FRASIER: If I might
interrupt here, uh...

18:00.012 --> 18:01.013
Please.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.899
Diane, what audition?

18:03.899 --> 18:05.400
Well, you know I sent off my tape

18:05.400 --> 18:06.401
to Boston Ballet.

18:06.401 --> 18:08.020
Yeah. What audition?

18:08.020 --> 18:10.823
Well, they had the nerve
to send it back unopened.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.825
They never even looked at it.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.194
I think that's patently unfair.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.579
Is that giving art a chance?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.081
Well, uh, Diane, do you think,

18:19.081 --> 18:21.450
uh, maybe you're just not ready
for the Boston Ballet? Hmm?

18:21.450 --> 18:23.919
Yes, I am.

18:23.919 --> 18:24.920
I know it.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.422
Madame Likova knows it.

18:27.422 --> 18:29.424
The only people who don't know it

18:29.424 --> 18:30.926
are the people at Boston Ballet,

18:30.926 --> 18:32.294
and they're about to find out.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.097
They're rehearsing now.

18:35.097 --> 18:37.015
They're going to see me

18:37.015 --> 18:40.018
if I have to do a grand
jet? over the gate.

18:40.018 --> 18:42.521
Uh, Diane, I think
that might be a mistake.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.523
Why?

18:44.523 --> 18:46.024
Don't you think I'm good enough?

18:46.024 --> 18:48.527
Oh, no. Oh, hey, are you kidding me?

18:48.527 --> 18:49.528
I think you're wonderful.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.397
Heh. So what's the point?

18:52.397 --> 18:54.733
Um, Frasier, the point?

18:57.369 --> 18:59.321
The point is...

18:59.321 --> 19:00.823
You know...

19:00.823 --> 19:05.077
you two have been behaving
very mysteriously lately.

19:05.077 --> 19:05.878
Oh...

19:05.878 --> 19:08.881
Are you planning a surprise party?

19:10.215 --> 19:13.168
(laughing): You're onto us.

19:13.168 --> 19:16.305
Darn! Oh...

19:16.305 --> 19:17.589
Well, I will try to act surprised.

19:17.589 --> 19:18.590
Oh.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.592
Well, that's great, but
as I was saying, Diane,

19:20.592 --> 19:22.594
the point is... well, not to make

19:23.095 --> 19:24.596
a big scene about this thing.

19:24.596 --> 19:25.597
You see, I-I'm sure the Boston Ballet

19:25.597 --> 19:26.598
must have, uh,

19:26.598 --> 19:27.599
open auditions, you know,

19:27.599 --> 19:28.600
from time to time.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.602
Why not, uh, wait till then?

19:30.602 --> 19:33.605
I've wasted enough
time already. Thank you.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.107
No, wait, Di-Diane, wait a second here.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.491
Uh, oh, boy.

19:36.491 --> 19:37.910
Listen, I-I'm going to...

19:37.910 --> 19:39.411
(laughs)

19:39.411 --> 19:41.413
I-I'm going to have
to tell you something,

19:41.413 --> 19:44.283
and, uh, you may not like it.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.585
You see, the-the truth...
the truth is that...

19:46.585 --> 19:50.339
Sam, I know what it is.

19:50.339 --> 19:53.125
You're afraid of losing
me to the world of ballet.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.629
No, no, see, that's...

19:57.629 --> 19:59.514
See, that's not what
I'm afraid of at all.

19:59.514 --> 20:02.267
Oh, my plucky little man.

20:05.187 --> 20:07.639
I-I-I...
Whoo, boy!

20:07.639 --> 20:10.142
I'm just going to have to come
right out and, uh, say this.

20:10.142 --> 20:13.612
Uh, I-I hope I don't hurt
your feelings here, um...

20:13.612 --> 20:16.398
Please, please, please, don't do this.

20:16.398 --> 20:18.233
Help me here, Frasier.

20:18.233 --> 20:21.870
Diane, please, please,
please, don't do this.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.159
Sam...

20:27.159 --> 20:31.413
this is one of the most
genuine displays of affection

20:31.413 --> 20:33.415
you've ever shown me.

20:33.415 --> 20:35.751
With love like this in my corner,

20:35.751 --> 20:37.502
how could I possibly fail?

20:37.502 --> 20:39.805
Yeah, well...

20:39.805 --> 20:40.672
Hmm...

20:40.672 --> 20:42.140
Frasier, she's not going to believe me.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.141
Tell her. Come on, tell her.

20:43.141 --> 20:44.142
Diane, Diane, just a second.

20:44.142 --> 20:45.644
There's something I've
got to get off my chest.

20:45.644 --> 20:47.145
Uh... Yes, Frasier?

20:48.146 --> 20:49.514
Knock 'em dead.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.817
Thank you.

20:55.404 --> 20:57.189
What?!

20:59.691 --> 21:01.693
(classical music playing on piano)

21:10.285 --> 21:11.286
Excuse me.

21:11.286 --> 21:13.789
Excuse me. Excuse me!

21:13.789 --> 21:15.540
Miss, we're in the
middle of a rehearsal.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.010
Yes, yes, and-and you're
all very wonderful,

21:18.010 --> 21:20.012
but I have something I'd like to say.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.513
CHOREOGRAPHER: Miss, please...

21:21.513 --> 21:23.015
This will only take a second.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.634
Hold it, everybody.
(piano playing stops)

21:26.518 --> 21:30.522
Oh, you may put her down.

21:30.522 --> 21:32.391
Kirby, please show
the lady to the wings.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.359
Oh, no, no, please.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.862
I must prove to you that I indeed belong

21:36.862 --> 21:39.364
in your fine fraternity. Kirby!

21:40.365 --> 21:41.867
I'm sorry, miss,

21:41.867 --> 21:44.236
but we just don't have
time for this right now.

21:44.236 --> 21:47.205
I don't have much time myself.

21:47.205 --> 21:49.708
A dancer's career is not a long one.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.961
I'm sorry, but it's true.

21:52.961 --> 21:57.799
I have a dream: to be a dancer.

21:57.799 --> 22:00.302
And in order for it to come true,

22:00.302 --> 22:01.803
you must see me dance.

22:02.304 --> 22:05.807
Oh, yes, my technique
is not quite as polished

22:05.807 --> 22:09.311
as it should be, but is
that all there is to art?

22:09.311 --> 22:10.312
Mere technique?

22:10.312 --> 22:13.932
Or is it not the passion

22:13.932 --> 22:17.736
and emotion and pain that
lie deep within our souls?

22:17.736 --> 22:22.240
For I have that emotion.
I have felt that pain.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.744
I... I am a feeling person,

22:25.744 --> 22:30.749
and I can communicate those
feelings to you through dance,

22:30.749 --> 22:36.755
so judge me not by what
my arms and legs are doing.

22:39.257 --> 22:43.762
Judge me... by what I make you feel.

22:43.762 --> 22:46.264
No, most importantly, judge me...

22:46.264 --> 22:47.766
for I must dance.

22:47.766 --> 22:50.268
Damn it, I must!

22:50.268 --> 22:51.887
Well...

22:51.887 --> 22:54.056
Oh! Thank you!

22:54.056 --> 22:56.391
You won't be disappointed.

22:56.391 --> 22:58.393
Oh, oh!

23:02.781 --> 23:04.149
SAM (whispering): Psst! Hey!

23:14.326 --> 23:16.828
(whispering)

23:32.177 --> 23:33.678
Never mind.

23:35.397 --> 23:39.518
(classical piano music playing)

23:40.305 --> 23:46.488
