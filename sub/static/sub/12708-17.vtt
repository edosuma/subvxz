WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:02.870
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:02.903 --> 00:06.174
-Hey, Dawnie.
-So, uh, anything new about
Warren and the nerd herd?

00:06.206 --> 00:09.643
-No.
-Man, a nerd goes into hiding,
he really goes into hiding.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.913
Big wedding coming up.
Lots of date possibilities.

00:12.945 --> 00:15.215
You and Tara are
speaking again.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.750
-You want to call her?
-No.

00:16.783 --> 00:19.853
But if I did call,
she wouldn't hang up on me.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.056
You can't even stand
to be around me.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.591
That is not true.

00:23.623 --> 00:25.393
You didn't want to come back.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.661
-It's over.
-I've memorized
this tune, love.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.763
I'm using you,
and it's killing me.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.600
I'm sorry, William.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.569
This is it.

00:36.936 --> 00:37.871
Are you ready to go?

00:39.406 --> 00:43.042
-He's gone.
-Xander's gone?
Xander's missing?

00:45.378 --> 00:47.081
ANYA:
What do you mean,
Xander's missing?

01:28.456 --> 01:32.492
(laughing)
Oh, man. Your face
is priceless.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.128
Yeah, real funny.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.296
It serves you right
for taking Z's
on the lookout again.

01:36.329 --> 01:40.301
What do you expect?
I haven't had a decent
night's sleep since--

01:40.334 --> 01:42.770
I mean, I'm going
Jack Torrance in here,
you know?

01:42.802 --> 01:45.239
Stuck in this basement
for weeks.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.008
We rented the whole house.
Can't we at least
sleep upstairs?

01:48.040 --> 01:51.645
We're on the lam.
We have to lay low.
Underground.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.581
That's figurative, doofus.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.682
Did you even read
 Legion of Doom?

01:55.716 --> 01:57.850
Okay, enough! Midgetor,
get back to the monitors.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.453
The last thing we need
is to be surprised by the--

01:59.486 --> 02:00.953
Holy geez louise.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.424
That-- That--

02:04.457 --> 02:06.926
-Called a friggin' Slayer.
-She's right there.

02:06.959 --> 02:11.164
All right. Don't panic.
Andrew, deploy your
little friend.

02:20.841 --> 02:24.177
(droning)

02:41.929 --> 02:44.198
-Oh, hi.
-(growling)

02:44.231 --> 02:46.834
You didn't by chance
happen to just eat a couple
of nerds, did you?

02:46.866 --> 02:48.034
(roars)

03:24.937 --> 03:28.207
-(screaming)
-You're gonna hurt yourself.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.578
She's gonna break the needle.
We're gonna have to
strap her down.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.079
(groaning)

03:46.259 --> 03:47.594
(theme music playing)

05:00.166 --> 05:03.370
WILLOW: Hi, uh, Tara.
How are you?

05:03.403 --> 05:07.440
I was wondering, maybe
you wanna go out sometime?

05:07.475 --> 05:10.143
For coffee, food...

05:10.177 --> 05:12.480
kisses and gay love?

05:12.512 --> 05:14.781
(sighs)
Hi, Tara.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.516
Guess what?

05:16.550 --> 05:19.019
Magic-free now
for insert number days now.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.365
-Hi.
-Hello.

05:46.079 --> 05:49.048
(machine beeps)

05:55.622 --> 05:56.923
Buffy, Buffy.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.228
Come on. It's time
for your drugs.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.065
-What?
-I said if I didn't
know any better,

06:06.098 --> 06:07.435
I'd think you were on drugs.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.971
Okay. Good.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.252
(sighs)

06:28.088 --> 06:29.355
What you doing?

06:29.389 --> 06:32.759
I'm online, checking
to see if Xander e-mailed.

06:32.793 --> 06:36.596
-Any luck?
-No such.

06:36.629 --> 06:40.199
Well, maybe Anya found him
and they're trying
to work it out.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.103
How come you're all home,
hearth and D.S.L. anyway?

06:43.136 --> 06:45.572
-I thought you were
gonna go see Tara.
-Saw her.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.074
Saw her completely.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.677
Ouch. Just got a scratch
from all that brittle.

06:52.512 --> 06:57.084
It's when I was seeing her,
she was seeing someone else.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.451
A girl.

06:59.519 --> 07:00.387
You mean?

07:00.420 --> 07:03.956
I mean, not "seeing" seeing.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.459
Well-- well, maybe.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.661
I don't know.
It was inconclusive,

07:07.694 --> 07:10.463
and I didn't
stick around to find out.

07:10.497 --> 07:13.100
I might have magicked my fist
through a wall or something.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.136
Wil, I'm sorry.

07:17.336 --> 07:20.007
And they're probably
just friends.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.810
I press my lips against
my friends all the time.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.845
I'm sure they're
just friends.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.481
Once you fall for Willow,
you stay fallen.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.651
Thanks, Buffy.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.019
(doorbell rings)

07:34.721 --> 07:36.689
-Hi. I'm back.
-WILLOW: Xander?

07:36.723 --> 07:37.990
Xander?

07:38.024 --> 07:40.459
Xander, you're here.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.161
We missed you.
Where were you?

07:43.730 --> 07:46.298
I know. I tried calling,
but I couldn't without--

07:46.332 --> 07:49.002
Hey, you don't need
to explain to us.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.971
Right.

07:53.005 --> 07:54.507
Is she here?

07:54.542 --> 07:57.610
Oh, no.
You wanna find her?

07:57.644 --> 07:59.512
I need to.

07:59.547 --> 08:02.048
Her suitcase is gone
and some of her stuff.

08:02.081 --> 08:06.485
And there's a closed sign
on the Magic Box, which, like,
chills me to the bone.

08:06.519 --> 08:09.822
-She left a couple days ago.
-Was she looking for me?

08:09.856 --> 08:12.225
Before she left,
did she say anything?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.394
You mean between sobs?

08:14.427 --> 08:17.029
WILLOW:
There was mostly
just wheezing.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.665
BUFFY:
She was a little--

08:18.699 --> 08:21.134
She was kind of broken.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.336
I don't know how stuff
got so mixed up.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.173
I blew it.

08:26.206 --> 08:30.577
No. Well, maybe
it wasn't the best time
to break up with her, but--

08:30.610 --> 08:33.279
No. It wasn't
about breaking up.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.817
I love her, and God,
I miss her so much.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.253
So you left her at the altar,
but you still wanna--

08:40.287 --> 08:42.087
You still wanna date?

08:42.121 --> 08:43.423
I guess.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.893
I know that I'm a better person
with her in my life.

08:46.793 --> 08:47.860
But things got so complicated

08:47.894 --> 08:49.229
with the wedding,
and with my family,

08:49.261 --> 08:52.331
and with her demons,
and "What if it all
goes to hell?"

08:52.365 --> 08:53.734
and forever.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.969
But then I left.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.739
And ever since,

08:58.772 --> 09:02.174
I've had
this painful hole inside.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.943
And I'm the idiot
that dug it out.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.682
I screwed up real bad.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.951
Hey, we all screw up.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.100
Looking for me?

09:28.134 --> 09:30.236
Really not.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.772
Oh. Right, then.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.807
Off you go.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.307
Did you cry?

09:36.109 --> 09:36.943
What?

09:38.611 --> 09:40.913
The wedding.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.816
Two hearts,
joined for eternity,

09:42.850 --> 09:45.485
great pelting showers
of rice and so forth.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.288
You didn't hear.

09:51.323 --> 09:54.260
What, the families
get out of hand?

09:55.828 --> 09:58.230
-Tear the place apart?
-No.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.967
Well, yes, absolutely.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.370
But Xander left.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.471
The wedding didn't happen.

10:07.474 --> 10:11.043
Wow, gotta say,
I didn't see that coming.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.947
It was awful.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.482
Anya was devastated.

10:16.515 --> 10:17.850
Is that right?

10:19.219 --> 10:22.088
And Xander thinks maybe they
can still get back together,

10:22.121 --> 10:24.658
but... he hurt her a lot.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.730
Yeah, well. Some people
can't see a good thing
when they've got it.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.503
-Spike.
-I should have known
you'd be tagging along.

10:36.536 --> 10:39.206
Hey, guys.
I, uh--

10:39.239 --> 10:43.143
I found Spike and was,
uh, trying to figure out...

10:43.176 --> 10:45.044
what kind of dangerous
contraband he had.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.447
I'll tell you what, Slayer.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.616
Let me get out of your way
and stop bothering you.

10:50.649 --> 10:53.821
Yeah, maybe you should do that,
Spike. Just run along.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.855
You know, I guess you know
all about that, don't you?

10:55.889 --> 10:57.557
The king of the big exit.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.292
I heard it brought
the house down.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.827
I don't need
this crap from you.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.995
Right.
Let's not listen to Spike.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.398
Might get a bit
of truth on you.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.701
Okay, okay.
Calm now.

11:08.735 --> 11:14.041
Let's, uh, turn around
and release this very
manly thing the other way.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.842
I forgot.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.577
Willy Wannabite can't hurt me.

11:18.610 --> 11:21.014
-Dumb to pick a fight, I guess.
-Xander.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.514
-More than happy to beat you
-Guys--

11:22.548 --> 11:24.517
right through the pain,
you pathetic poof.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.187
You guys, don't.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.690
MAN:
Buffy, can you hear me?

11:39.399 --> 11:40.734
What is this?

11:40.768 --> 11:42.369
Do you know
where you are, Buffy?

11:45.739 --> 11:47.106
Sunnydale.

11:47.139 --> 11:48.441
No, none of that's real.
None of it.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.677
You're in a mental
institution.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.212
You've been with us
now for six years.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.315
Do you remember?

12:01.553 --> 12:03.791
-Buffy, are you okay?
-What happened?

12:03.823 --> 12:04.991
(groans)

12:09.096 --> 12:11.331
It's okay, Buffy.
Buffy, it's okay.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.769
Look. Look who's here.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.239
Buffy.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.811
Welcome home, sweetie.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.724
Mom?

12:37.756 --> 12:40.293
Oh, baby. You're really here.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.327
Dad?

12:41.360 --> 12:44.096
DOCTOR:
She's lucid. Keep talking.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.865
Maybe the sound
of your voice will ground her.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.802
HANK:
Sweetheart?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.004
We've missed you very much.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.274
Honey, can you hear me?

12:55.307 --> 12:57.644
(whimpers)

12:57.677 --> 12:59.278
JOYCE: Oh, Buffy,
stay with us, please.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.613
(groans)
No!

13:04.650 --> 13:07.855
-Here. Let's get her
back to my crypt.
-Spike, just go, okay?

13:07.888 --> 13:09.556
She's our friend.
We'll take care of her.

13:11.323 --> 13:13.159
No, guys.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.361
Come on, Xander.
Help me get her home.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.302
Put a little ice
on the back of her neck.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.975
She likes that.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.379
BUFFY: I've been having
these flashes.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.216
Hallucinations, I guess.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.317
Since when?

13:38.350 --> 13:41.587
Uh, night before last.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.625
I was checking houses
on that list you gave me

13:45.658 --> 13:48.327
and looking for
Warren and his pals.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.730
And then bam.

13:51.764 --> 13:56.937
Some kind of gross,
waxy demon thing poked me.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.838
And when you say "poke"--

13:59.873 --> 14:01.073
In the arm.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.342
It-- It stung me or something,

14:03.375 --> 14:05.946
and then it was like...

14:07.246 --> 14:09.515
No. It-- it wasn't "like".

14:09.548 --> 14:11.884
I was in an institution.

14:11.918 --> 14:15.221
There were, um, doctors and...

14:15.254 --> 14:18.457
nurses and--
and other patients.

14:20.692 --> 14:22.761
They-- they told me
that I was sick.

14:24.596 --> 14:26.432
I guess crazy.

14:28.534 --> 14:33.740
And that, uh, Sunnydale
and-- and all of this...

14:33.773 --> 14:35.841
none of it was real.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.945
Aw, come on, that's ridiculous.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.879
What, you think
this isn't real

14:39.980 --> 14:42.081
just because of all
the vampires, and demons,

14:42.115 --> 14:43.917
and ex-vengeance demons,

14:43.951 --> 14:48.455
and the sister
that used to be a big ball
of universe-destroying energy?

14:48.488 --> 14:51.290
I know how this must sound,
but it felt so real.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.128
Mom was there.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.264
She was?

14:57.297 --> 14:58.565
Dad too.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.534
They were together.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.105
Like they used to be...

15:05.138 --> 15:07.106
before Sunnydale.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.876
Okay.
All in favor of research?

15:10.909 --> 15:12.445
Motion passed.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.714
All right, Xander.
You hit the demon bars.

15:14.746 --> 15:17.649
Dig up any info on a new
player in town.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.619
Dawnie, you can
help me research.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.288
We'll hop online,
check all the--

15:21.321 --> 15:25.057
Possibilities for
a full recovery, but we have
to proceed cautiously.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.326
-If we're not careful--
-JOYCE: Wait.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.760
Are you saying that Buffy

15:28.794 --> 15:30.830
could be like she was before
any of this happened?

15:32.798 --> 15:34.834
Mrs. Summers,
you have to understand

15:34.866 --> 15:37.803
the severity of what's happened
to your daughter.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.605
For the last six years,

15:39.639 --> 15:42.908
she's been in
an undifferentiated type
of schizophrenia.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.479
We know what her condition is.
That's not what we're asking.

15:47.779 --> 15:50.116
Buffy's delusion
is multilayered.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.818
She even believes
she's some type of hero.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.086
The Slayer?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.123
The Slayer, right.
But that's only one level.

15:56.155 --> 15:59.259
She's also created
an intricate latticework

15:59.292 --> 16:02.129
to support her
primary delusion.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.197
In her mind,
she's the central figure

16:04.230 --> 16:07.600
in a fantastic world
beyond imagination.

16:07.634 --> 16:12.205
She's surrounded
herself with friends, most
with their own superpowers,

16:12.239 --> 16:14.307
who are as real to her
as you and me.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.809
More so, unfortunately.

16:17.844 --> 16:23.015
Together they face grand,
overblown conflicts against
an assortment of monsters,

16:23.049 --> 16:26.885
both imaginary
and rooted in actual myth.

16:26.918 --> 16:30.322
Every time we think
we're getting through to her,

16:30.356 --> 16:34.994
-more fanciful enemies
magically appear and she's--
-Enemies.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.529
Warren and Jonathan.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.231
They did this to me.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.600
-Buffy.
-Buffy, it's all right.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.203
They can't hurt you here.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.105
You're with your family.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.475
Dawn?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.711
That's the sister, right?

16:51.744 --> 16:53.413
The magical key.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.384
Buffy inserted Dawn
into her delusion,

16:57.417 --> 16:59.418
actually rewriting
the entire history of it

16:59.451 --> 17:03.289
to accommodate a need
for a familial bond.

17:05.723 --> 17:09.060
Buffy, but that created
inconsistencies, didn't it?

17:09.096 --> 17:10.829
Your sister, your friends,

17:10.863 --> 17:13.531
all of those people
you created in Sunnydale,

17:13.566 --> 17:17.069
they aren't as comforting
as they once were, are they?

17:17.104 --> 17:19.239
They're coming apart.

17:19.271 --> 17:22.509
Buffy, listen to what
the doctor is saying.
It's important.

17:22.540 --> 17:28.079
Buffy, you used to create
these grand villains
to battle against.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.781
And now what is it?

17:29.816 --> 17:33.051
Just ordinary students
you went to high school with.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.288
No gods or monsters.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.625
Just three
pathetic little men...

17:40.559 --> 17:42.628
who like playing with toys.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.134
Dude, that poison
has got her drooling,
like some kind of--

17:47.166 --> 17:48.634
Where have you guys been?

17:49.902 --> 17:53.272
Uh, picking up some stuff.

17:53.306 --> 17:57.309
And checking out Buffy on
the van's remote surveillance.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.547
Andrew's demon pet has done
some number on the Slayer.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.549
Got her trippin' like
a Ken Russell film festival.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.417
Well, what kind of stuff?

18:05.451 --> 18:06.618
What?

18:06.653 --> 18:09.622
The packages, what's in them?

18:09.655 --> 18:12.592
What do you think, Spanky?
Do you think we're
plotting against you?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.294
Better not be.

18:15.961 --> 18:18.730
It's just stuff, big man.
All right?

18:18.765 --> 18:22.169
You'll be in the know,
just as soon as you stop
being all freakazoid.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.239
Ah. There's the vault.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.941
I still say we're gonna
need eight other guys
to pull this off.

18:28.974 --> 18:30.442
I never should have
let you see that movie.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.346
-Where you going?
-Out.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.914
Getting stuff I need.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.950
You know, I don't really think
that's such a good idea.

18:37.983 --> 18:39.185
Why not?

18:40.787 --> 18:43.190
Well, it's--

18:43.222 --> 18:45.625
It's just not safe
out there alone.

18:46.858 --> 18:48.827
You saw how close
the Slayer got.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.364
But we're-- we're a team.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.866
Something happens to you,
it happens to all of us, right?

18:54.901 --> 18:56.469
WARREN: Look, I know--
I know you're antsy,

18:56.502 --> 18:58.037
We all are.
But you see, things, they're--

18:58.069 --> 19:00.707
they're about to pick up
big-- big time.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.611
We just gotta be careful
right now, all right?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.679
Stick together.

19:06.712 --> 19:07.913
Okay?

19:29.167 --> 19:31.738
Look, Buffy.
I found the demon.

19:31.770 --> 19:35.074
It fits your description
and symptoms perfectly.

19:35.106 --> 19:36.509
Look. Is this it?

19:39.177 --> 19:40.747
See? It's gonna be okay.

19:40.779 --> 19:44.616
It's pokey stinger carries
an antidote to its own poison.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.357
I feel so lost.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.260
I know.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.694
You're confused.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.498
It's that crazy juice
inside you.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.098
It's more than that.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.703
Even before the demon.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.474
I've been so detached.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.578
We've all been
kind of slumming.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.714
Every day I try
to snap out of it...

20:17.616 --> 20:18.917
figure out why I'm like that.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.452
Buffy, look at me.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.123
You are not
in an institution.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.594
You have never been
in an institution.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.498
Yes, I have.

20:32.097 --> 20:33.299
What?

20:39.939 --> 20:42.575
Back when I saw
my first vampires.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.246
I got so scared.

20:48.948 --> 20:53.420
I told my parents,
and they completely
freaked out.

20:56.154 --> 20:59.826
They thought
there was something
seriously wrong with me.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.632
So, they sent me to a clinic.

21:06.965 --> 21:09.801
Y-- You never said anything.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.474
I was only there
a couple of weeks.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.780
I stopped talking about it,

21:21.814 --> 21:24.049
and they let me go.

21:25.852 --> 21:29.087
Eventually...

21:29.121 --> 21:32.525
my parents just forgot.

21:33.992 --> 21:35.427
God.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.096
That's horrible.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.832
What if I'm still there?

21:41.334 --> 21:43.736
What if I never
left that clinic?

21:45.872 --> 21:46.972
Buffy.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.742
Buffy, you're not.

21:52.845 --> 21:56.516
I'm so sorry
you had to go through that.

21:57.916 --> 22:00.653
But it'-- its the past.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.356
You've gotta trust me.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.224
We're gonna get you
that antidote.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.162
Xander's hunting
the demon right now.

22:10.195 --> 22:11.498
Alone?

22:11.530 --> 22:13.566
Willow, he can't.
It's too strong.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.835
It's okay. We got help.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.806
So she's having
the wiggins, is she?

22:19.838 --> 22:22.040
Thinks none of us are real.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.143
Bloody self-centered,
if you ask me.

22:24.175 --> 22:27.346
Spike, we need muscle,
not color commentary.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.348
On the other hand,
it might explain some things.

22:30.383 --> 22:33.420
This all being in that
twisted brain of hers.

22:33.452 --> 22:36.355
Yeah. Fix up some
chip in my head.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.391
Make me soft,
fall in love with her.

22:38.424 --> 22:41.160
Then turn me
into her sodding sex slave.

22:41.192 --> 22:42.294
What?

22:43.796 --> 22:47.165
Nothing.
Alternative realities

22:47.199 --> 22:50.603
where we're all little
figments of Buffy's
funny farm delusion.

22:50.636 --> 22:54.105
You know, in a different
reality, you might not have
left your bride at the altar.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.442
You might have gone through
with it like a man.

22:55.474 --> 22:57.375
Okay, one more syllable
about Anya--

22:57.410 --> 22:59.244
-(roars)
-(yells)

23:01.313 --> 23:04.584
Oh, balls.
You didn't say he was
a Glarghk Guhl Kashmas'nik.

23:04.616 --> 23:06.184
'Cause I can't say Glarba--

23:06.218 --> 23:07.420
(growling)

23:24.770 --> 23:25.672
(grunts)

23:34.913 --> 23:37.148
I altered his reality.

23:37.182 --> 23:38.484
Get it? I--

23:39.519 --> 23:40.853
Never mind.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.455
DAWN:
I made you some tea.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.661
Thanks.

23:53.532 --> 23:54.701
I'm okay, Dawn.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.471
The thousand-yard stare
really helps sell that.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.214
You're burning up.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.420
I should be taller than you.

24:14.452 --> 24:16.556
Maybe you're not done growing.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.226
Coming apart.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.796
What's coming apart?

24:23.829 --> 24:25.263
We have to try harder.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.032
Make things better.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.334
I'm trying.

24:28.366 --> 24:30.102
Your grades.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.202
Stealing.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.843
Willow's been doing
your chores, hasn't she?

24:36.875 --> 24:37.844
What?

24:38.911 --> 24:41.847
No, it's--
it's the fever.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.382
It's cooking your brain.

24:45.416 --> 24:47.118
We have to deal
with these things, Dawn. We--

24:47.153 --> 24:49.989
You don't have
a sister, Buffy.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.624
Dawn.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.491
No, honey.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.727
Say it.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.528
It'll help you believe it.

24:58.396 --> 25:02.734
I don't... have a sister.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.637
I know. I...

25:05.672 --> 25:07.472
I didn't grow up with her.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.076
These monks,
they-- they made her.

25:13.579 --> 25:17.148
It's your mind just
playing tricks on you.

25:17.182 --> 25:21.452
JOYCE:
You're our little girl, Buffy.
Our one and only.

25:22.421 --> 25:25.490
We've missed you so much.

25:25.523 --> 25:29.060
Mom and Dad just
want to take you home
and take care of you.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.613
I'm not even there, am I?

25:47.579 --> 25:49.048
What?

25:50.148 --> 25:51.750
You said it a second ago.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.588
You don't have a sister.

26:00.125 --> 26:04.096
It's your ideal reality,
and I'm not even a part of it.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.700
Dawn, I--
I didn't mean--

26:07.733 --> 26:09.736
I have to go
finish my chores.

26:15.273 --> 26:16.742
-(growling)
-Hold it.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.645
-XANDER: Hold it.
-I'll need its arm.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.614
Oh-- Please!

26:21.647 --> 26:23.414
Yeah, I'd like
both my arms too.

26:26.285 --> 26:30.757
Thanks, Spike. I'll help when
the blistering pain subsides.

26:30.789 --> 26:31.624
Oh!

26:33.960 --> 26:34.826
Ready?

26:42.701 --> 26:45.304
Xander,
go to the magic shop.

26:45.336 --> 26:47.973
I'll need alkanet root
and a handful of nettle leaf.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.942
Just for medicinal
properties, no magic.

26:49.976 --> 26:52.310
When you've got them,
meet me at the campus lab.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.780
I'll see if I can
brew up an antidote
the old-fashioned way.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.182
I'll hold here,
keep an eye on the wax job.

26:57.215 --> 26:59.885
-Make sure that's all
you're ogling.
-Xander.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.522
WILLOW:
Buffy, wake up.

27:04.556 --> 27:07.125
Got yummy antidote
goodness for you.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.031
What happened?

27:13.065 --> 27:15.267
It took a little longer
than I had hoped,

27:15.300 --> 27:16.803
no magic and all.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.371
It went boom twice,
but then I got it.

27:19.404 --> 27:22.508
Just, when it's cooled,
drink it all down

27:22.540 --> 27:24.743
and everything should go
back to normal.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.647
You never stop coming through.

27:29.682 --> 27:31.416
Thank you, Willow.

27:36.888 --> 27:37.890
How is she?

27:39.657 --> 27:41.559
Make sure she drinks all that.

27:41.593 --> 27:44.596
I'm gonna let Dawn know
that everything's
gonna be okay.

27:50.201 --> 27:51.502
You all right?

27:55.074 --> 27:57.343
You need to leave me alone.

27:57.375 --> 27:59.711
You're not a part of my life.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.548
Fine then.

28:04.784 --> 28:07.219
You know, but I hope
you don't think this an--

28:09.922 --> 28:12.892
I hope you don't think
this antidote's gonna rid you
of that nasty martyrdom.

28:12.924 --> 28:15.493
See, I've figured it out, love.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.596
You can't help yourself.

28:17.628 --> 28:19.565
You're not drawn
to the dark like I thought.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.402
You're addicted to the misery.

28:23.434 --> 28:26.505
That's why you won't
tell your pals about us.

28:26.538 --> 28:30.509
You might actually
have to be happy if you did.

28:30.541 --> 28:35.614
They'd either understand
and help you, God forbid,
or drive you out...

28:35.646 --> 28:41.386
where you could finally be
at peace in the dark with me.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.221
Either way,
you'd be better off for it,

28:43.255 --> 28:45.090
but you're too
twisted for that.

28:48.594 --> 28:51.897
Let yourself live already.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.802
And stop with the bloody
hero trip for a sec.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.971
We'd all be the better for it.

29:01.673 --> 29:05.845
You either tell your friends
about us, or I will.

29:52.858 --> 29:53.826
DOCTOR:
Buffy.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.828
I don't wanna go back there.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.333
I wanna be healthy again.

30:06.571 --> 30:08.406
What do I have to do?

30:13.711 --> 30:17.016
Oh, please help me.

30:17.048 --> 30:20.685
I-- I wanna go home
with you and Dad.

30:20.719 --> 30:22.888
I know, Buffy.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.623
But first you've
gotta get better.

30:24.655 --> 30:25.892
It's not gonna
be easy, Buffy.

30:25.924 --> 30:28.826
You have to take it
one step at a time.

30:28.861 --> 30:31.297
You have to start
ridding your mind

30:31.329 --> 30:34.365
of those things that
support your hallucinations.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.969
You understand?

30:37.002 --> 30:39.671
There are things in that world
that you cling to.

30:39.704 --> 30:42.407
For your delusion,
they're safe-holds.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.210
But for your mind,
they're traps.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.913
We have to break those down.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.548
Slaying?

30:50.582 --> 30:52.750
Yes.

30:52.784 --> 30:55.421
I'm talking about
those things you want there.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.490
What keeps you going back.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.991
My friends.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.894
That's right.

31:01.928 --> 31:04.896
Last summer when you had
a momentary awakening,

31:04.931 --> 31:07.232
it was them that
pulled you back in.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.268
JOYCE:
They're not really
your friends, Buffy.

31:09.300 --> 31:12.939
They're just tricks keeping you
from getting healthy.

31:12.971 --> 31:16.775
You have to do whatever
it takes to convince
yourself of that, Buffy.

31:16.807 --> 31:18.544
Whatever it takes.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.784
Buffy, I-- I didn't see you.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.185
I was just coming
to check on you.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.588
You feeling better?
Did the antidote work?

31:30.622 --> 31:35.426
I'm still pretty dazed,
but, uh, better.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.762
No more cuckoo's nest?

31:37.796 --> 31:41.366
Well, we still have
the big bad all "tranqed" out
down in the basement

31:41.400 --> 31:43.469
in case it didn't work
and we need more parts.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.508
It'll be nice
to see you all better.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.145
Thanks.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.646
I can make you some food,

31:55.681 --> 31:58.616
something big with energy,
help you clear your noggin.

31:59.518 --> 32:00.786
Come on.

32:03.955 --> 32:05.191
(knocking)

32:06.692 --> 32:08.759
Hello? I'm back.

32:08.794 --> 32:11.329
Clean and with
a better smell now.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.601
Friends? Romans?

32:17.769 --> 32:19.005
Anyone?

32:25.176 --> 32:26.345
Hey.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.779
Hey there, sane girl.

32:28.814 --> 32:31.416
So did Willow get that
antidote to you all right?

32:31.450 --> 32:33.785
Yeah. I'm better now.

32:33.818 --> 32:35.520
Great. So it's settled.

32:35.554 --> 32:36.721
We're, uh, we're real, right?

32:37.955 --> 32:39.525
I guess we should
finish off that demon

32:39.557 --> 32:41.492
and drag it out
of the basement.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.795
And tell me
you're up for that.

32:43.828 --> 32:46.097
I so don't wanna
see Spike right now.

32:46.132 --> 32:49.134
I mean,
talk about losing touch.

32:49.167 --> 32:53.638
I hate to say it,
but I almost feel sorry
for the guy. Almost.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.606
The things
that poor guy was saying.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.175
I mean, I get it, you know?

32:57.209 --> 32:58.809
I've been a part
of the Buffy obsession.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.051
Buffy! What--

33:17.028 --> 33:19.530
WILLOW:
(grunts)

33:23.068 --> 33:25.671
Willow, w-- what--

33:35.047 --> 33:37.249
(growling)

33:37.282 --> 33:39.351
(growls)

34:06.044 --> 34:07.278
Dawn?

34:30.735 --> 34:32.637
Don't you knock?

34:33.938 --> 34:35.606
I called for you.

34:37.108 --> 34:39.610
Buffy, are you okay?

34:41.980 --> 34:43.449
Where are you going?

34:45.516 --> 34:47.286
I'm going over to Janice's,

34:47.318 --> 34:50.456
where they actually like
having me around.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.425
-You're not going anywhere.
-(scoffs)

34:53.458 --> 34:54.793
Why not?

34:54.826 --> 34:56.728
You want me gone anyway.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.096
What do you care?

34:58.130 --> 34:59.465
I care.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.768
You're going downstairs
with the others.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.672
It's the only way
I can get healthy.

35:06.704 --> 35:08.940
What are you talking about?

35:12.311 --> 35:13.612
Buffy, you look sick.

35:15.012 --> 35:17.483
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

35:18.849 --> 35:21.387
Stay away from me!
Willow, help!

35:23.954 --> 35:25.956
Buffy, please!

35:25.990 --> 35:28.626
You can't hide, Dawn.

35:28.659 --> 35:30.429
Talk to me!

35:30.461 --> 35:32.063
You're hallucinating!

35:33.164 --> 35:36.134
I know. You're just
a trap for my mind.

35:36.168 --> 35:38.836
Buffy, please listen to me.

35:38.869 --> 35:41.672
That asylum and those people,
they're not real.

35:53.251 --> 35:56.222
Buffy, look at me.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.224
I'm right here.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.561
You're my sister.

36:02.594 --> 36:05.231
I need you and love you.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.668
Somewhere inside,
you must know that's real.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.402
Sure it is.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.206
'Cause what's more real?

36:15.240 --> 36:18.510
A sick girl
in an institution...

36:18.543 --> 36:19.878
Don't.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.315
-Please listen to me.
-or some kind of supergirl...

36:23.349 --> 36:27.753
chosen to fight demons
and save the world?

36:30.856 --> 36:32.690
That's ridiculous.

36:38.096 --> 36:41.867
-(screams)
-A girl who sleeps
with a vampire she hates?

36:41.900 --> 36:44.369
Yeah, that makes sense.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.411
No! Buffy, stop!

36:52.443 --> 36:53.778
I'm real!

36:55.481 --> 36:57.248
Buffy, stop it!
I'll be good!

36:58.884 --> 37:01.420
I promise.
You're not thinking.

37:01.452 --> 37:04.556
(muffled screaming)

37:14.733 --> 37:16.635
DEMON: (growling)

37:18.336 --> 37:19.771
DOCTOR:
It's okay, Buffy.
Don't stress yourself.

37:19.804 --> 37:22.474
Honey, take your time.

37:22.507 --> 37:25.710
Make it as easy
on yourself as possible.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.579
There's nothing wrong with that.

37:43.027 --> 37:46.331
Buffy, what are you doing?

37:53.539 --> 37:55.641
-Oh, my God.
-DEMON: (growling)

38:09.487 --> 38:10.856
Buffy, help me!

38:12.391 --> 38:13.525
I need my hands!

38:19.731 --> 38:21.065
Hello?

38:25.804 --> 38:27.706
Anybody home?

38:27.739 --> 38:29.340
(grunting)

38:37.849 --> 38:39.885
Buffy?

38:44.021 --> 38:46.123
It-- It's gonna be okay,
sweetheart.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.626
Whatever it is,
it's not real, remember?

38:48.659 --> 38:52.597
Just keep concentrating.
I'm right here, sweetie.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.701
XANDER:
Buffy, help me!

38:55.733 --> 38:56.902
Buffy, help!

38:59.036 --> 39:00.539
-(door opens)
-Willow?

39:03.074 --> 39:04.742
(speaking Latin)

39:06.445 --> 39:07.878
(speaking Latin)

39:13.784 --> 39:15.686
-No!
-No, Tara!

39:20.358 --> 39:22.760
-I don't know.
-JOYCE: Buffy.

39:22.793 --> 39:25.262
-Look at me.
-I-- I don't--
I don't know.

39:25.295 --> 39:26.731
I believe in you.

39:27.898 --> 39:28.900
(whimpers)

39:28.934 --> 39:30.635
You're a survivor.
You can do this.

39:36.407 --> 39:38.577
-(screaming)
-(growling)

39:40.945 --> 39:42.146
Xander.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.382
(screaming)

39:54.492 --> 39:56.126
-Willow!
-JOYCE: Buffy.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.563
(whimpers)

39:57.596 --> 40:00.197
Buffy.
Buffy, fight it.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.802
You're too good to give in.
You can beat this thing.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.336
Be strong, baby.
Okay?

40:07.472 --> 40:09.574
I know you're afraid.

40:09.608 --> 40:13.277
I know the world feels
like a hard place sometimes,

40:13.311 --> 40:15.280
but you've got
people who love you.

40:15.313 --> 40:18.849
Your dad and I,
we have all the faith
in the world in you.

40:20.117 --> 40:23.320
We'll always be with you.

40:23.353 --> 40:27.324
You've got a world
of strength in your heart.
I know you do.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.628
You just have to
find it again.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.429
Believe in yourself.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.449
You're right.

40:53.485 --> 40:55.353
Thank you.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.893
Good-bye.

41:10.335 --> 41:11.536
Buffy.

41:13.338 --> 41:15.472
-DAWN: (screaming)
-DEMON: (growling)

41:32.858 --> 41:33.692
(grunts)

41:35.425 --> 41:37.327
(moaning)

41:54.780 --> 41:57.382
I'm so sorry.

42:00.851 --> 42:01.820
WILLOW:
Buffy?

42:01.853 --> 42:04.188
We're okay.
It's all okay.

42:07.192 --> 42:10.327
-Buffy, sit down.
You'll fall over.
-BUFFY: No.

42:10.360 --> 42:14.364
I can't. Not until
I have the antidote.

42:14.398 --> 42:15.601
WILLOW:
Okay.

42:15.634 --> 42:18.202
We'll make more.
We'll take care of it.

42:18.235 --> 42:20.438
Everything's
gonna be okay, Buffy.

42:27.144 --> 42:30.280
I-- I'm sorry.
There's no reaction at all.

42:30.315 --> 42:32.449
I'm afraid we lost her.

42:36.253 --> 42:38.724
(sobbing)

42:51.769 --> 42:52.838
(theme music playing)

43:16.994 --> 43:18.829
Grr! Arrgh!
