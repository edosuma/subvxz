17:02.068 --> 17:03.379
WEST VIRGINIA.

17:03.379 --> 17:05.379
UCF WOULD LOSE EVERY SINGLE GAME

17:05.379 --> 17:06.758
IF THEY PLAYED IN THE S.E.C.,

17:06.758 --> 17:09.000

17:24.137 --> 17:27.000
THE PAC-12 HASN'T BEEN RELEVANT

17:27.000 --> 17:27.862
SINCE THAT PETE CARROLL WAS

17:27.862 --> 17:29.448
CHEATING AND NOTRE DAME ISN'T

20:18.551 --> 20:21.000
IT WAS REALLY DUMPING THAT DAY.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.034
FINALLY, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY

20:22.034 --> 20:23.793
WEEK THERE IS ANOTHER SENSELESS

20:23.793 --> 20:25.103
MASS SHOOTING WHICH MEANS I HAVE

20:25.103 --> 20:31.931
TO CUT OUT MY HYSTERICAL GUN

20:31.931 --> 20:32.241
JOKES.

20:32.241 --> 20:32.551
WHY?

20:32.551 --> 20:35.517
I'M A COMPASSIONATE HUMAN.

20:35.517 --> 20:35.965
NO MORE.

20:35.965 --> 20:38.827
I FOUND A GUN SHOOTING TO REMIND

20:38.827 --> 20:44.103
US SHOOTINGS CAN BE

20:44.103 --> 20:47.724
LIGHTHEARTED.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.172
IT'S NOT ATTEMPTED MURDER IF

20:49.172 --> 20:52.034
IT'S BELOW THE WAIST.

20:52.034 --> 20:54.068
I'D LIKE TO PREWISH YOU A HAPPY

20:54.068 --> 20:56.827
THANKSGIVING, HANUKKAH, NEW

20:56.827 --> 20:58.965
YEAR'S, BOTH REGULAR AND

20:58.965 --> 21:00.068
CHINESE, VALENTINE'S, ST.

21:00.068 --> 21:03.327
PATRICK'S DAY.

21:03.327 --> 21:03.551
GOOD NIGHT.
