<b>These suction cups saved me.</b>

00:06.170 --> 00:08.650
<b>Anyway, aren't you an octopus?</b>

00:08.650 --> 00:09.980
<b>Don—</b>

01:29.980 --> 01:34.990
<b>Ikalgo x And x Lightning</b>

01:36.520 --> 01:41.740
<b>A mob of assassins attacks Killua after he 
and Gon split up to stop the selection.</b>

01:42.350 --> 01:46.170
<b>One of them is Ikalgo, 
an octopus Chimera Ant.</b>

01:47.020 --> 01:48.750
<b>Aren't you an octopus?</b>

01:48.750 --> 01:50.800
<b>Don't call me an octopus!</b>

01:52.630 --> 01:54.510
<b>See ya!</b>

01:54.830 --> 01:59.010
<b><i>I need to find a new host, or 
I can't charge up my next shot.</i></b>

01:59.400 --> 02:02.010
<b><i>I'll let the Ortho siblings take it from here.</i></b>

02:08.010 --> 02:10.060
<b>Yo, we meet again.</b>

02:11.600 --> 02:13.100
<b>So we do...</b>

02:13.100 --> 02:15.130
<b>Long time, no see!</b>

02:15.130 --> 02:16.060
<b>Ya know?</b>

02:17.740 --> 02:18.930
<b>Can I ask you something?</b>

02:18.930 --> 02:21.000
<b>Sure, go ahead!</b>

02:21.000 --> 02:23.700
<b>Why didn't you dive underwater to escape?</b>

02:24.860 --> 02:28.390
<b>You should have an advantage in the water.</b>

02:28.390 --> 02:31.210
<b>Don't tell me you can't swim.</b>

02:31.430 --> 02:33.940
<b>Uh, well...</b>

02:33.940 --> 02:35.080
<b>It's the blood, right?</b>

02:37.240 --> 02:40.780
<b>When they smell blood, your 
buddies in the water go berserk</b>

02:40.780 --> 02:43.930
<b>and attack the injured, no matter who it is.</b>

02:44.670 --> 02:48.740
<b>With those wounds, if you went in there, 
you'd be torn to shreds.</b>

02:49.500 --> 02:50.510
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

02:50.510 --> 02:52.990
<b>Uh, w-well...</b>

02:52.990 --> 02:54.980
<b>I suppose that's one way to...</b>

02:54.980 --> 02:57.530
<b>Ikalgo, did you finish off the kid?</b>

02:57.950 --> 02:59.490
<b>No, we're still fighting!</b>

03:00.700 --> 03:02.240
<b>Who are you talking to?</b>

03:03.490 --> 03:05.240
<b><i>I screwed up!</i></b>

03:05.770 --> 03:09.340
<b>Right, you all can communicate via telepathy.</b>

03:09.640 --> 03:13.160
<b>Talking to your boss? It's that guy 
who was flying over me, right?</b>

03:13.160 --> 03:14.970
<b>Wait, now look here...</b>

03:14.970 --> 03:16.990
<b>Uh, so...</b>

03:14.970 --> 03:18.280
<b>Hey, Ikalgo! Answer me!</b>

03:16.990 --> 03:20.510
<b>You could say that's what I might be doing...</b>

03:18.280 --> 03:20.510
<b>Yes! We're still fighting!</b>

03:21.170 --> 03:22.990
<b>Oh, sorry to interrupt you.</b>

03:22.990 --> 03:24.760
<b>Let me know if you learn anything.</b>

03:25.860 --> 03:29.680
<b>If he sees dozens of dragonflies 
flying around inside a cave,</b>

03:29.680 --> 03:32.220
<b>the enemy would get suspicious...</b>

03:32.220 --> 03:35.020
<b>I won't be able to send my 
Satellite Dragonflies inside.</b>

03:35.250 --> 03:37.250
<b>Let's make a deal, then.</b>

03:38.800 --> 03:42.860
<b>If you tell me about his power, 
I'll spare your life.</b>

03:43.340 --> 03:44.780
<b>You have ten seconds to answer.</b>

03:52.360 --> 03:53.670
<b>Eight seconds left.</b>

04:02.860 --> 04:03.970
<b>Six seconds.</b>

04:14.350 --> 04:17.970
<b>I wanted to be reborn a squid...</b>

04:18.960 --> 04:22.880
<b>I would've given anything to have 
been a <i>Chiroteuthis imperator</i>.</b>

04:26.760 --> 04:29.420
<b>Do you think octopi and squid are similar?</b>

04:29.990 --> 04:31.330
<b>If so, you're mistaken...</b>

04:32.650 --> 04:34.200
<b>Octopi are ugly.</b>

04:34.980 --> 04:36.250
<b>Squid are squidderific.</b>

04:36.910 --> 04:39.520
<b>I think they look divine!</b>

04:43.890 --> 04:45.340
<b>Two seconds.</b>

04:45.950 --> 04:48.700
<b>I won't betray a buddy!</b>

04:49.700 --> 04:52.210
<b><i>Yeah, I could see that in your eyes.</i></b>

04:53.220 --> 04:54.650
<b>I can only hope</b>

04:56.000 --> 04:59.720
<b>that in my next life, I'll be born a squid...</b>

05:09.460 --> 05:10.240
<b>Wh—</b>

05:11.700 --> 05:12.690
<b>Why?</b>

05:13.430 --> 05:14.620
<b>Because you're a cool guy.</b>

05:16.820 --> 05:21.130
<b>In different circumstances, 
we could've been friends.</b>

05:35.830 --> 05:36.930
<b>You lowered your guard!</b>

05:36.930 --> 05:39.310
<b>Didn't think fish could jump, eh?</b>

05:40.830 --> 05:43.650
<b>I'll crush you and the rock behind you!</b>

05:45.090 --> 05:46.880
<b>Come in, Ikalgo.</b>

05:46.880 --> 05:49.930
<b>Y-Yes, the fight isn't over yet!</b>

05:49.930 --> 05:53.630
<b>Has he used any weapons or special abilities?</b>

05:54.810 --> 05:55.950
<b>Ikalgo!</b>

05:59.700 --> 06:01.640
<b>No, he's been fighting...</b>

06:03.610 --> 06:05.870
<b>with only his bare hands.</b>

06:06.670 --> 06:09.630
<b>Come on... Beg for your life.</b>

06:09.630 --> 06:11.720
<b>Otherwise, it's no fun!</b>

06:11.720 --> 06:14.050
<b>Or are you in too much pain to talk?</b>

06:14.640 --> 06:16.680
<b>Yeah, this is a relief.</b>

06:16.920 --> 06:17.940
<b>Huh?</b>

06:18.430 --> 06:21.610
<b>Fighting scumbags like you is a lot easier.</b>

06:21.610 --> 06:22.640
<b>Huh?</b>

06:22.640 --> 06:25.190
<b>I have no qualms about killing you.</b>

06:27.780 --> 06:30.290
<b>Yep! He was just a scumbag!</b>

06:30.290 --> 06:31.450
<b>That's why he was the decoy!</b>

06:35.640 --> 06:37.980
<b>I did it, Ortho-sama!</b>

06:37.980 --> 06:39.990
<b>I've attached the badge!</b>

06:39.990 --> 06:42.760
<b>Coburn pulled it off!</b>

06:42.760 --> 06:44.570
<b>Time to start the game.</b>

06:46.010 --> 06:47.850
<b>Let's enjoy ourselves.</b>

06:50.820 --> 06:53.590
<b>Damn, the bleeding won't stop...</b>

06:54.380 --> 06:57.150
<b>I need to find an exit.</b>

06:59.320 --> 07:03.270
<b><i>A digital sound inside my head?</i></b>

07:06.510 --> 07:07.270
<b><i>Wha—</i></b>

07:08.900 --> 07:10.110
<b><i>What?</i></b>

07:10.940 --> 07:13.620
<b><i>A fish? But I'm not in the water!</i></b>

07:14.290 --> 07:15.590
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

07:15.980 --> 07:19.090
<b><i>I didn't sense anything!</i></b>

07:23.080 --> 07:24.280
<b><i>Again...</i></b>

07:24.280 --> 07:29.130
<b><i>I didn't see anything or sense any 
aura until the fish hit me!</i></b>

07:31.920 --> 07:33.900
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

07:36.630 --> 07:37.640
<b><i>This is bad.</i></b>

07:38.390 --> 07:42.080
<b><i>I can't tell where the attacks are coming from.</i></b>

07:44.370 --> 07:46.650
<b>108 points.</b>

07:47.590 --> 07:50.640
<b>You have no idea what's going on?</b>

07:51.090 --> 07:54.960
<b>I should say that you're 
hearing my voice in your head.</b>

07:55.620 --> 07:59.660
<b>Well, if you survive long enough, 
you'll figure out what's happening.</b>

08:02.830 --> 08:05.360
<b><i>These are fish made from</i> Nen.</b>

08:05.360 --> 08:08.240
<b><i>So why can't I sense them?</i></b>

08:08.690 --> 08:11.510
<b><i>Something must be triggering 
them from somewhere else.</i></b>

08:12.050 --> 08:13.430
<b><i>That's the only possible explanation!</i></b>

08:14.210 --> 08:18.560
<b><i>How else could I be attacked by 
something I can't see or sense?</i></b>

08:25.310 --> 08:26.980
<b>This is going well...</b>

08:32.170 --> 08:37.370
<b>Well, have you determined 
anything about these attacks?</b>

08:37.600 --> 08:38.880
<b><i>Three...</i></b>

08:38.880 --> 08:41.590
<b><i>He can only materialize three fish at once.</i></b>

08:42.390 --> 08:45.230
<b><i>After that, the fish will disappear.</i></b>

08:45.230 --> 08:47.770
<b><i>And the vivid colors of the 
target he put on me...</i></b>

08:48.380 --> 08:50.310
<b><i>It can only mean one thing!</i></b>

08:53.940 --> 08:55.350
<b>Your power involves</b>

08:56.640 --> 08:57.730
<b>darts!</b>

08:59.610 --> 09:01.400
<b>Bingo.</b>

09:02.240 --> 09:03.740
<b>That's correct.</b>

09:03.740 --> 09:07.690
<b>But the great thing about our power 
is that figuring it out won't help you.</b>

09:08.090 --> 09:10.190
<b>Because my <i>Nen</i> fish darts</b>

09:10.700 --> 09:14.370
<b>have no physical form until the 
instant they pierce your flesh.</b>

09:14.370 --> 09:16.950
<b>That makes it impossible to block them.</b>

09:18.740 --> 09:21.480
<b>Incidentally, your left shoulder is 54 points.</b>

09:22.470 --> 09:24.960
<b>I have a dart board</b>

09:25.450 --> 09:29.960
<b>that's linked to various parts of your body.</b>

09:29.960 --> 09:31.250
<b>For instance...</b>

09:33.230 --> 09:35.240
<b>Your right elbow is 27 points.</b>

09:36.510 --> 09:38.480
<b>Your right hand is 18 points.</b>

09:40.670 --> 09:43.120
<b>99 points...</b>

09:44.380 --> 09:45.930
<b>Hey, what's wrong?</b>

09:45.930 --> 09:47.950
<b>I can't hear your screams.</b>

09:48.580 --> 09:50.770
<b>Are you already dead?</b>

09:51.480 --> 09:53.820
<b>The game's only just begun.</b>

09:54.700 --> 09:55.490
<b>Triple 6!</b>

09:56.840 --> 09:57.720
<b>4!</b>

09:58.610 --> 09:59.660
<b>13!</b>

10:01.350 --> 10:02.940
<b>Bravo!</b>

10:02.940 --> 10:04.680
<b>Brother, that was magnificent.</b>

10:04.680 --> 10:06.130
<b>You're on a roll.</b>

10:06.130 --> 10:07.500
<b>Naturally...</b>

10:07.800 --> 10:09.770
<b>Our lives are on the line...</b>

10:10.530 --> 10:12.510
<b>This is how the Ortho siblings' power works.</b>

10:12.510 --> 10:14.790
<b>The sister creates a <i>Nen</i> badge,</b>

10:14.790 --> 10:17.710
<b>which activates after it's affixed to the target.</b>

10:18.170 --> 10:23.260
<b>That links the target to the dart 
board created by the brother.</b>

10:23.860 --> 10:27.560
<b>Until the game ends, no one 
can deactivate the badge,</b>

10:27.560 --> 10:28.970
<b>not even the Ortho Siblings.</b>

10:28.970 --> 10:33.270
<b>When the brother's darts hit the board, 
the target is attacked by needlefish.</b>

10:34.020 --> 10:36.630
<b>There is no way to avoid this attack.</b>

10:36.630 --> 10:40.410
<b>That is because, until they've 
hit the target's body,</b>

10:40.410 --> 10:42.280
<b>the needlefish do not exist.</b>

10:42.880 --> 10:46.540
<b>Thus, it is impossible to sense 
them coming or dodge them.</b>

10:47.440 --> 10:50.200
<b><i>This is our unbeatable power...</i></b>

10:51.290 --> 10:53.720
<b><i>Needlefish De Darts!</i></b>

10:51.310 --> 10:53.190
<b>Death Games</b>

10:53.190 --> 10:54.530
<b>Death Games
Needlefish De Darts</b>

10:55.050 --> 10:58.710
<b>Of course, the siblings incur some risk.</b>

10:58.710 --> 11:00.880
<b>Once the badge activates, they are invincible.</b>

11:00.880 --> 11:07.070
<b>But if the brother misses the board with the 
final dart that decides the game's outcome,</b>

11:08.630 --> 11:11.520
<b>all of the damage the target has taken</b>

11:11.520 --> 11:13.440
<b>will transfer to the siblings.</b>

11:13.840 --> 11:17.190
<b>We are invincible. That is because...</b>

11:17.930 --> 11:21.240
<b>We are bound by the 
strongest trust in the world.</b>

11:22.250 --> 11:25.000
<b><i>It isn't over yet...</i></b>

11:28.680 --> 11:31.960
<b>Well, it seems the game's almost over.</b>

11:34.100 --> 11:35.870
<b>Why don't you tell him that?</b>

11:35.870 --> 11:38.310
<b>No need to be that nice.</b>

11:38.310 --> 11:44.470
<b>If he were pleading for his life, 
it'd be easier for me to focus.</b>

11:44.810 --> 11:48.350
<b>Or if he were to give up 
and beg me to kill him,</b>

11:48.350 --> 11:54.480
<b>or if he wanted to be a nihilistic hero 
and said, "Not a bad way to die."</b>

11:54.990 --> 11:59.770
<b>Those would help motivate me, 
as I toss my darts.</b>

11:59.770 --> 12:04.490
<b>But he'll just have to dread his impending 
death, never knowing when it will end...</b>

12:08.500 --> 12:10.390
<b>Until he dies.</b>

12:12.300 --> 12:13.420
<b><i>It's not...</i></b>

12:13.900 --> 12:15.430
<b><i>It's not over yet!</i></b>

12:17.590 --> 12:19.500
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

12:19.500 --> 12:23.570
<b><i>This looks pretty bad...</i></b>

12:24.300 --> 12:27.930
<b><i>I've lost way too much blood.</i></b>

12:29.150 --> 12:31.200
<b><i>I could die here,</i></b>

12:31.820 --> 12:34.940
<b><i>so no point in saving what's left.</i></b>

12:35.270 --> 12:36.430
<b>Now, then.</b>

12:37.230 --> 12:39.520
<b>It's my final turn.</b>

12:44.040 --> 12:45.320
<b>Left ear.</b>

12:46.970 --> 12:49.620
<b>That sure gave him a big earring.</b>

12:51.880 --> 12:53.000
<b>Right calf!</b>

12:58.810 --> 13:01.420
<b>Okay, time for the last throw.</b>

13:01.740 --> 13:03.920
<b>My brother, I trust you.</b>

13:04.240 --> 13:05.610
<b>I've got this.</b>

13:33.000 --> 13:33.950
<b>See?</b>

13:33.950 --> 13:35.960
<b>Bravo!</b>

13:36.670 --> 13:37.820
<b>Yay!</b>

13:37.000 --> 13:37.820
<b>Yay!</b>

13:37.820 --> 13:39.330
<b>Yay!</b>

13:40.960 --> 13:43.460
<b>You're the best in the world!</b>

13:44.030 --> 13:45.520
<b>I'll go check his corpse.</b>

13:45.520 --> 13:46.970
<b>I'll come with you.</b>

13:46.970 --> 13:50.520
<b>We should share some of the 
meat with Coburn as a reward.</b>

13:59.300 --> 14:00.730
<b>Aren't you gonna eat?</b>

14:04.750 --> 14:06.830
<b>Can I ask you something?</b>

14:06.830 --> 14:07.740
<b>What?</b>

14:08.130 --> 14:11.780
<b>What made you decide to trust me?</b>

14:11.780 --> 14:13.600
<b>It wasn't that I didn't trust you.</b>

14:13.600 --> 14:17.150
<b>I just didn't know why you were following me.</b>

14:17.750 --> 14:20.370
<b>And you swore that you weren't lying.</b>

14:20.370 --> 14:22.500
<b>Huh?! That's it?</b>

14:22.500 --> 14:24.510
<b>Isn't that enough?</b>

14:24.510 --> 14:26.530
<b>Hell, no!</b>

14:26.530 --> 14:30.610
<b>Liars make promises all the time!</b>

14:30.610 --> 14:33.060
<b>A promise is the one thing 
you should never trust!</b>

14:33.060 --> 14:34.890
<b>Then you were lying?</b>

14:35.880 --> 14:37.620
<b>I'm different...</b>

14:37.620 --> 14:39.010
<b>I don't lie!</b>

14:39.010 --> 14:41.020
<b>I only tell the truth!</b>

14:41.230 --> 14:42.510
<b>Then it's okay.</b>

14:45.760 --> 14:48.000
<b><i>I think I'm starting to lose it.</i></b>

14:48.000 --> 14:50.780
<b><i>He's strong, but he's just a kid.</i></b>

14:50.780 --> 14:55.300
<b><i>I'm putting my fate in the 
hands of this clueless boy?</i></b>

14:56.170 --> 15:00.540
<b>Besides, if you're lying, that'll 
actually make things easier for me.</b>

15:00.540 --> 15:01.540
<b>Easier?</b>

15:02.150 --> 15:04.150
<b>I won't have to show you any mercy.</b>

15:05.510 --> 15:07.390
<b>I'll be free to destroy you.</b>

15:09.790 --> 15:14.910
<b><i>The look... The look in the kid's eyes...</i></b>

15:14.910 --> 15:20.240
<b><i>Yes, this is why I had a hunch...</i></b>

15:20.980 --> 15:23.970
<b><i>There's something special about this kid.</i></b>

15:23.970 --> 15:27.290
<b><i>I can't even tell how much 
power he really has...</i></b>

15:32.290 --> 15:35.870
<b>You hit him right in the forehead.</b>

15:36.910 --> 15:40.000
<b>Flutter-sama, we've taken out the target.</b>

15:40.420 --> 15:42.560
<b>Really? That's excellent.</b>

15:42.560 --> 15:47.060
<b>I will tell Leol-sama that a 
promotion is in order.</b>

15:47.060 --> 15:48.880
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

15:49.230 --> 15:50.340
<b>Great!</b>

15:50.340 --> 15:52.940
<b>We can be assistant squadron leaders now!</b>

15:52.940 --> 15:53.660
<b>Yay!</b>

15:53.660 --> 15:54.290
<b>Yay!</b>

15:54.290 --> 15:56.670
<b>Yay!</b>

16:04.730 --> 16:06.540
<b>H-How?</b>

16:06.540 --> 16:09.650
<b>How can you be alive with a dart 
sticking out of your brain?!</b>

16:12.290 --> 16:13.010
<b>What?</b>

16:13.830 --> 16:15.910
<b>It's a suction cup from an octopus.</b>

16:16.920 --> 16:18.090
<b>No way.</b>

16:18.090 --> 16:20.470
<b>How did you manage that trick?</b>

16:20.470 --> 16:22.220
<b>No, wait...</b>

16:22.220 --> 16:24.420
<b>My... My darts were perfect!</b>

16:24.850 --> 16:27.630
<b>It's absolutely impossible to stop them!</b>

16:27.630 --> 16:30.480
<b>Yeah, I didn't stop it.</b>

16:30.480 --> 16:32.180
<b>I just grabbed it,</b>

16:32.890 --> 16:36.990
<b>the moment it materialized at my head.</b>

16:38.910 --> 16:41.970
<b>From what you were saying, I could tell</b>

16:41.970 --> 16:45.190
<b>you could hear my voice, 
but you couldn't see me.</b>

16:45.190 --> 16:51.240
<b>I had plenty of time to switch out 
the needle for a suction cup.</b>

16:52.300 --> 16:54.010
<b>H-Hold on...</b>

16:54.010 --> 17:01.110
<b>No human has reflexes fast 
enough to catch a dart!</b>

17:01.110 --> 17:06.440
<b>Well, it wouldn't have been possible had 
I not known where it would appear.</b>

17:07.230 --> 17:12.460
<b>But I knew exactly where and 
when the last dart would hit.</b>

17:13.970 --> 17:20.260
<b>The final dart must hit the board's 
outer ring per double out rules.</b>

17:20.980 --> 17:24.660
<b>And you were playing an 01—501 game.</b>

17:26.540 --> 17:31.020
<b>You start with 501 points, 
and the goal is to reach 0.</b>

17:31.560 --> 17:34.490
<b>These rules are used in professional competition.</b>

17:34.490 --> 17:37.930
<b>I n-never told you what rules I was using!</b>

17:38.280 --> 17:42.210
<b>As soon as I knew you were playing darts, 
my suspicions were confirmed.</b>

17:42.840 --> 17:44.500
<b>Remember how</b>

17:45.280 --> 17:47.320
<b>your first dart hit double 4?</b>

17:49.100 --> 17:52.680
<b>The game starts by hitting the board's outer ring.</b>

17:52.680 --> 17:54.230
<b>A double in...</b>

17:54.740 --> 17:57.200
<b>A sign that you were confident in your skill.</b>

17:58.610 --> 18:02.290
<b>A skilled player would play by official rules.</b>

18:02.860 --> 18:07.520
<b>Players with talent and confidence 
tend to seek public recognition.</b>

18:08.130 --> 18:10.520
<b>After that, I just had to do the 
math and endure the pain.</b>

18:11.320 --> 18:14.490
<b>I subtracted your points from 501,</b>

18:14.490 --> 18:16.750
<b>and waited until your score was under 40.</b>

18:18.080 --> 18:20.280
<b>At that point,</b>

18:20.930 --> 18:25.950
<b>I placed my hand in the 40-point area, my forehead.</b>

18:26.640 --> 18:27.790
<b>That's all it took.</b>

18:29.130 --> 18:34.160
<b>To improve his reflexes, Killua changed 
his aura into electricity.</b>

18:34.590 --> 18:36.430
<b>When the dart touched his skin,</b>

18:36.430 --> 18:38.460
<b>the sensation did not travel</b>

18:38.460 --> 18:42.630
<b>from his skin to his brain 
using the nervous system.</b>

18:42.630 --> 18:48.060
<b>He used <i>Nen</i> to ensure that, as soon 
as the aura registered the dart,</b>

18:48.060 --> 18:51.690
<b>it sent a message directly to his 
left hand, to grab the dart.</b>

18:52.290 --> 18:54.690
<b>Do you have some history with darts?</b>

18:54.920 --> 18:56.760
<b>At age six, I mastered the game.</b>

18:56.760 --> 18:59.310
<b>I've counted down from 1,440 points.</b>

18:59.760 --> 19:01.450
<b>It was part of my early training.</b>

19:04.350 --> 19:07.440
<b>It's your fault for getting cocky 
and talking too much!</b>

19:05.690 --> 19:07.440
<b><i>Or was I seven?</i></b>

19:07.440 --> 19:08.240
<b>You're so stupid!</b>

19:08.240 --> 19:09.550
<b><i>Guess it doesn't matter...</i></b>

19:08.240 --> 19:12.880
<b>Pipe down! You just stood around and clapped!</b>

19:09.980 --> 19:11.610
<b><i>I talked too long.</i></b>

19:12.880 --> 19:14.210
<b><i>I need to hurry!</i></b>

19:21.730 --> 19:22.720
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

19:25.060 --> 19:26.700
<b><i>What?</i></b>

19:27.620 --> 19:32.990
<b><i>My body won't do what I tell it to...</i></b>

19:33.470 --> 19:35.490
<b><i>Wait, is this really happening?</i></b>

19:39.890 --> 19:41.690
<b><i>Wow...</i></b>

19:42.420 --> 19:45.610
<b><i>All this is my blood?</i></b>

19:46.520 --> 19:50.760
<b><i>It feels like I'm taking a warm bath.</i></b>

19:51.780 --> 19:55.570
<b><i>Wait, this isn't the time to think about that...</i></b>

19:56.210 --> 19:57.360
<b><i>I should get going.</i></b>

20:04.720 --> 20:09.520
<b><i>Crap... Now I feel cold...</i></b>

20:10.320 --> 20:12.320
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

20:12.320 --> 20:17.610
<b><i>And after that last fight gave me a hint...</i></b>

20:18.250 --> 20:20.010
<b><i>for improving my power.</i></b>

20:22.420 --> 20:23.630
<b><i>Am I...</i></b>

20:24.170 --> 20:25.840
<b><i>going to die here?</i></b>

20:28.570 --> 20:31.740
<b><i>Gon... Sorry...</i></b>

20:33.790 --> 20:39.360
<b><i>I wasn't any... help...</i></b>

20:54.310 --> 20:55.250
<b>Octopus...</b>

20:55.910 --> 20:58.190
<b>Don't call me an octopus!</b>

21:01.610 --> 21:03.510
<b>What are you doing?</b>

21:04.320 --> 21:05.850
<b>Isn't that obvious?</b>

21:05.850 --> 21:07.800
<b>I'm turning traitor.</b>

21:07.800 --> 21:09.220
<b>Lame, huh?</b>

21:09.220 --> 21:10.950
<b>Now stop talking.</b>

21:10.950 --> 21:13.340
<b>I know a secret doctor.</b>

21:13.340 --> 21:15.270
<b>It won't take long by underground waterway.</b>

21:15.270 --> 21:17.220
<b>Don't die before we get there!</b>

21:18.080 --> 21:19.450
<b>Are you an idiot?</b>

21:19.450 --> 21:24.210
<b>I spared... your life...</b>

21:24.730 --> 21:28.740
<b>Now they'll be hunting you...</b>

21:28.740 --> 21:30.820
<b>I know that!</b>

21:30.820 --> 21:32.470
<b>Don't ask me why I'm doing this.</b>

21:35.580 --> 21:38.660
<b><i>But you know...</i></b>

21:39.270 --> 21:43.560
<b><i>After you told me, an octopus, 
that I was a cool guy...</i></b>

21:44.100 --> 21:46.510
<b><i>After you said we could be friends...</i></b>

21:47.840 --> 21:50.240
<b><i>I couldn't let you die!</i></b>

21:54.410 --> 21:56.370
<b>I'm gonna save you!</b>

21:56.680 --> 21:59.050
<b>Don't die on me!</b>

23:24.840 --> 23:27.220
<b>Next time: Power x And x Games.</b>

23:28.490 --> 23:31.460
<b>If you smoke, your teeth will turn black.</b>

23:31.460 --> 23:33.720
<b>I'm a chameleon, so I don't have teeth!</b>
