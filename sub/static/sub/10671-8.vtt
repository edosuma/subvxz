WEBVTT

00:06.358 --> 00:08.443
[Chip] Look, all I did was deliver
the message. You can't...

00:08.527 --> 00:10.654
No, all you did was save Venice.

00:10.737 --> 00:13.532
That hotel would have killed me
and the restaurant.

00:13.615 --> 00:16.117
From now on, you eat for free.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.912
Look, I'm just...

00:18.996 --> 00:20.622
I'm happy to be of service.

00:21.623 --> 00:24.209
Look, man, why don't you come
by the council meeting here tonight?

00:24.292 --> 00:26.837
We need more people like you
who care about our community.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.715
You keep going like this,
you'll be the real Mayor of Venice.

00:29.798 --> 00:31.800
All right, Oscar.

00:31.884 --> 00:34.302
- Politics?
- [chuckles]

00:34.386 --> 00:36.805
<i>Ich bin ein Berliner.</i>

00:36.889 --> 00:38.891
So, how did you save Venice?

00:38.974 --> 00:40.767
Truth be told,
I got a little help from Tilly.

00:40.851 --> 00:41.852
- Tilly?
- Yeah.

00:41.935 --> 00:43.478
What the hell did she get out of it?

00:43.562 --> 00:47.566
I gave her the one thing
that would make her truly happy.

00:47.649 --> 00:48.775
Divorce.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.316
[grunting]

01:32.736 --> 01:34.613
- [Chip groans]
- Yes!

01:34.696 --> 01:37.699
Whoo! [Exhales]

01:37.783 --> 01:40.035
Oh, man.
That was a close game.

01:40.119 --> 01:41.202
Yeah.

01:41.286 --> 01:42.955
[panting]

01:43.038 --> 01:45.165
- You played well.
- Yeah. Thank you.

01:45.248 --> 01:48.460
- That backhand felt really good today.
- Yeah.

01:50.295 --> 01:52.714
I did not sleep well last night.

01:52.798 --> 01:54.716
Uh-huh.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.219
No, just...
the bed in the guesthouse is...

01:58.303 --> 02:01.098
- Here it comes.
- No, it's just so uneven.

02:01.181 --> 02:04.559
You just moved back in
and you're already complaining?

02:04.643 --> 02:06.603
Wait, wait. Are you complaining
about the guesthouse?

02:06.686 --> 02:09.606
Or are you just making excuses
for why you just lost?

02:09.689 --> 02:12.734
Both. I mean, neither.

02:12.818 --> 02:15.195
It's just, after all those...

02:15.278 --> 02:18.782
the years of listening to you
complain about the bed in there,

02:18.865 --> 02:20.993
I never took you seriously.

02:21.076 --> 02:22.119
Sorry.

02:24.204 --> 02:25.497
Okay.

02:26.999 --> 02:29.334
So, I just won this set,
fair and square, right?

02:30.460 --> 02:32.253
That's not my decision.

02:33.755 --> 02:37.926
[acoustic rock music playing]

04:25.325 --> 04:26.367
[grunts]

04:36.169 --> 04:37.378
Shit.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.070
- [horns honking]
- [car alarm blaring]

05:04.572 --> 05:07.951
Wait. Whoa, whoa!
What the fuck is going on?

05:08.034 --> 05:10.745
- Put that shit down!
- [Jerry] Easy, man.

05:19.712 --> 05:22.007
- Finally kicking me out, huh?
- What did you expect, Chip?

05:22.090 --> 05:25.927
I mean, you cost me
four million dollars.

05:26.011 --> 05:30.098
Jerry, that wasn't me.
I had... that was Save Venice, man.

05:30.182 --> 05:32.684
You fucked me out of four million dollars.
I know you did.

05:36.021 --> 05:37.230
Yeah, I'm sorry.

05:39.274 --> 05:41.943
Oh? You're sorry?

05:42.027 --> 05:45.488
You're... you're sorry?

05:45.571 --> 05:49.242
Oh, God, I didn't realize
you were sorry. Wow.

05:50.410 --> 05:55.374
I mean, I still can't believe
that you fucked me.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.710
Actually, I'm... I'm proud of you.

05:58.793 --> 06:02.005
But you're still kicking me out, huh?

06:04.299 --> 06:06.092
Oh, Chip...

06:08.387 --> 06:12.098
- It's nothing personal.
- Tilly know?

06:12.182 --> 06:13.474
[exhaling, coughing]

06:13.558 --> 06:15.060
What do I care?

06:19.398 --> 06:25.278
It's just that I saw her the other day,
and I made it perfectly clear that...

06:25.362 --> 06:28.448
either I stay in the store
or the truth comes out.

06:28.531 --> 06:31.326
Oh, about the accident?

06:31.410 --> 06:33.661
Yeah.

06:33.745 --> 06:36.039
So, it was a bluff?

06:37.249 --> 06:39.000
I was serious.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.588
The truth always comes out in the end.

06:43.671 --> 06:50.262
Chip, I just don't think that the truth
is the good friend that you think it is.

06:51.388 --> 06:52.389
How so?

06:52.472 --> 06:55.683
I mean, I've been watching you
for, what, ten years now?

06:55.767 --> 07:02.523
And, you know, you've made a really
nice life for yourself out here, I'd say.

07:02.607 --> 07:07.153
The "Mayor of Venice" life, you know?

07:07.237 --> 07:10.282
And... And with your troubled past

07:10.365 --> 07:15.412
that gives you so much credibility
in the neighborhood and in your meetings.

07:16.288 --> 07:19.249
Yeah. Oh, and the chicks.

07:19.332 --> 07:24.170
We shouldn't even talk
about the chicks at all, right?

07:26.047 --> 07:29.468
Are you really sure
you want to give all that up?

07:29.550 --> 07:32.095
I mean, for what?

07:32.178 --> 07:35.098
Just because you want
the truth to come out?

07:35.181 --> 07:38.226
I don't think you want that.
You know why?

07:40.061 --> 07:42.147
Because you're a fake, Chip.

07:44.983 --> 07:48.820
And the truth destroys a... a fake.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.411
So, it was a bluff.

07:56.911 --> 07:57.954
[clicks tongue]

08:03.502 --> 08:05.295
Come on, guys. Keep it up.

08:11.926 --> 08:14.554
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Chevy.

08:14.637 --> 08:17.640
[rock music playing]

08:32.447 --> 08:34.157
- Hey!
- Hey, Dennis.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.618
- Uh, look, I know what's going on.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

08:37.702 --> 08:39.745
I'm going to give you the opportunity
to come clean here.

08:39.828 --> 08:42.374
- Seriously, I...
- Yeah?

08:42.457 --> 08:45.877
- Is this about me and Stefan?
- I don't give a shit about that.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.546
Then I have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.673
- The wine, Kara.
- Here?

08:50.756 --> 08:53.301
No. The wine...
No, the wine in the cellar.

08:53.385 --> 08:54.969
The one that I told you
I wasn't going to open.

08:55.053 --> 08:56.637
What the fuck?
What about the wine?

09:00.559 --> 09:03.769
Wait. That wasn't you, was it?

09:04.521 --> 09:08.024
Wait. You thought that I stole
a thousand-dollar bottle of wine.

09:08.107 --> 09:11.236
No. No, no, no. I'm so...
I thought that you drank it.

09:11.319 --> 09:13.029
Fuck you, Dennis.

09:13.112 --> 09:15.031
- I'm sorry. I...
- What?

09:18.701 --> 09:21.079
- Dennis! Jesus!
- [groans] Sorry! I'm sorry.

09:21.162 --> 09:22.163
What the fuck?

09:41.015 --> 09:42.517
[rattling]

09:54.613 --> 09:56.197
[Chip] <i>How long you worked</i>
<i>for Topher?</i>

09:57.365 --> 09:59.534
About a year. Over a year.

09:59.618 --> 10:01.953
But you... you've done
this sort of thing before?

10:02.036 --> 10:04.247
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.878
You got a family?

10:12.880 --> 10:18.052
Yeah. I got two kids, eight and ten.
And a wife, of course.

10:18.136 --> 10:20.138
[chuckles] Of course.

10:25.226 --> 10:26.603
You guys live in a house?

10:28.647 --> 10:33.192
Yeah. We're up in Northern California...
in a house.

10:33.276 --> 10:34.860
That's a hell of a commute.

10:34.944 --> 10:37.071
I take the company plane.

10:37.155 --> 10:39.198
You mean...

10:39.282 --> 10:41.742
You... You fly it? Or...

10:43.161 --> 10:47.707
Sorry. It really... It shouldn't be
too much longer. He's on a call.

10:58.426 --> 10:59.719
Chip?

11:03.348 --> 11:05.266
- Chip!
- [clattering]

11:07.977 --> 11:09.479
Hey, buddy. Is that you?

11:12.898 --> 11:16.611
- [groaning]
- Oh, shit! Uh, sorry. Sorry!

11:19.238 --> 11:20.448
[Dennis groaning]

11:21.907 --> 11:23.034
Fuck!

11:26.746 --> 11:29.081
[Topher] Hey, Chip. What's the matter?
Phone not working?

11:29.165 --> 11:32.460
- No, it's nothing like that.
- So, what can I do for you?

11:32.544 --> 11:35.338
Well, how do you know
it's not the other way around?

11:35.421 --> 11:37.215
What I can do for you.

11:37.298 --> 11:38.841
- Is it?
- No.

11:38.924 --> 11:41.969
- Yeah. Okay, talk to me.
- I'm getting kicked out of the store.

11:43.555 --> 11:44.389
Okay.

11:44.472 --> 11:49.352
And I know we talked about it before
and we even got really close, but...

11:49.435 --> 11:52.772
- You want me to buy the store?
- No, I want to buy the store.

11:52.855 --> 11:54.815
But, in order to do that...

11:56.942 --> 11:58.570
I'm a little short, is all.

11:58.653 --> 12:02.240
Sorry, you... you want me
to give you four million dollars?

12:02.323 --> 12:06.619
- Think of it as a loan between friends.
- You're not that good of a friend.

12:06.703 --> 12:08.747
- So, you'll think about it?
- No.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.916
- You won't even think about it?
- I just did and the answer is no.

12:13.959 --> 12:17.129
- I'm sorry that you feel that way.
- You can't stop a tide, Chip.

12:17.213 --> 12:19.131
- Change is inevitable.
- Okay.

12:19.215 --> 12:21.426
Even if I did give you
the four million dollars,

12:21.509 --> 12:23.803
the hotel development
is still going to happen.

12:23.886 --> 12:27.640
- Yeah, well, I stopped it once before.
- You stopped Wiener and Kaufmann.

12:27.724 --> 12:31.060
It's only a matter of time
before someone else comes along.

12:38.109 --> 12:38.943
You?

12:39.944 --> 12:44.824
I thought you loved this place.
The vibe, the community...

12:44.907 --> 12:49.161
"This... this is real." What, you're going
to just sell out, just like that?

12:49.245 --> 12:52.498
There's no selling out, Chip.
There's only buying in.

12:57.796 --> 13:00.005
How did you stop Wiener and Kaufmann?

13:00.673 --> 13:02.883
I got a lot of pull in this town.
You know that.

13:02.967 --> 13:05.428
Save Venice? What, are you
their leader or something?

13:06.095 --> 13:07.096
Something like that.

13:08.556 --> 13:10.349
Actually, maybe you can be of service.

13:13.478 --> 13:14.979
Our lives would be a whole lot easier

13:15.062 --> 13:17.482
if we got a good reaction
at the meeting tonight.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.904
- [shower running]
- Cooler!

13:24.947 --> 13:26.532
Cooler, come on out, man!

13:26.616 --> 13:28.909
[Cooler] Give me a sec, dude!
I just got in!

13:29.577 --> 13:32.831
- Whoa! Jesus, man!
- What? It sounded urgent.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.374
I know, but... [sighs] come on.

13:35.458 --> 13:38.085
- Use another towel.
- This is the only clean one I had.

13:38.169 --> 13:39.879
What the fuck, dude?

13:39.962 --> 13:41.380
[chortling]

13:43.090 --> 13:47.136
Okay, listen, I...
don't sit on the couch, man!

13:47.219 --> 13:49.681
Dude, what did you want
to talk to me about, man?

13:49.764 --> 13:53.434
[sighing] Look, you need to get in touch
with all the Save Venice people, okay?

13:53.518 --> 13:57.897
Just, everybody. Stefan and Gypsy
and Terrance and Uno. Everybody.

13:57.980 --> 14:00.817
- You want to do a party?
- No, man. [Sighs]

14:00.900 --> 14:02.694
The hotel development is back on.

14:02.777 --> 14:04.904
What? But you already talked
to the Wiener, man. You killed it.

14:04.987 --> 14:07.323
Yeah, it turns out
it was just a flesh wound.

14:07.406 --> 14:10.117
That's why you need
to mobilize the troops.

14:10.201 --> 14:14.246
Get everybody on the same page before
the big town council meeting tonight.

14:14.330 --> 14:16.123
We got to make sure that the...

14:16.207 --> 14:18.877
good people of Venice
vote the right way.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.420
This is, like, a "for real" deal
emergency type situation.

14:21.504 --> 14:22.630
This is serious.

14:22.714 --> 14:24.382
Fuck yeah, dude.

14:24.465 --> 14:26.801
What are you doing?
This has to happen now.

14:27.927 --> 14:29.762
[stifled inhale]
Dude, like, right now?

14:31.263 --> 14:32.682
[sighing]

14:41.399 --> 14:42.400
[sighs]

15:11.763 --> 15:13.848
A 2005?

15:22.106 --> 15:24.358
[line ringing on telephone]

15:26.485 --> 15:28.988
[George] <i>Sorry. I'm unable</i>
<i>to get to the phone right now</i>

15:29.071 --> 15:32.742
<i>on account that it's in my ass pocket
and I got it on vibrate.</i>

15:32.825 --> 15:35.035
<i>- So, I like to let it ring.</i>
- [beep]

15:35.119 --> 15:39.457
Hey, George. It's Dennis.
Uh, look, I really need to talk to you.

15:39.540 --> 15:43.920
It's about Chip.
He's... in trouble, you know?

15:44.003 --> 15:45.797
If you know what I mean.

16:03.272 --> 16:04.106
David?

16:06.859 --> 16:08.820
Hey, Claire.

16:10.655 --> 16:13.073
Or is it, uh, "London" now?

16:16.995 --> 16:18.913
I like the new look.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.541
How'd you find me?

16:22.625 --> 16:25.503
- Does it... Does it matter?
- No. Just, um...

16:26.838 --> 16:28.006
you promised.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.633
Yeah, I know...
to give you space and time.

16:30.716 --> 16:36.305
I just didn't expect you
to take so much of it, is all.

16:37.515 --> 16:39.141
Yeah, neither did I.

16:44.438 --> 16:49.652
I actually started thinking that since
so much time had passed, that...

16:49.735 --> 16:51.654
you know, that she wanted me
to come find her,

16:51.737 --> 16:56.575
kind of, like, a test or proof
that I loved you.

16:59.244 --> 17:03.749
- Here I am.
- I'm sorry, David.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.501
You... You have some food in your...

17:09.213 --> 17:11.965
Look, I just...
I can't wait around forever, Claire.

17:12.050 --> 17:16.804
You're going to have to decide. Me or...

17:16.887 --> 17:19.138
that guy who sells stools?

17:25.646 --> 17:28.357
- [siren whooping]
- [tires screech]

17:28.440 --> 17:29.692
What the fuck, man?

17:30.776 --> 17:32.361
You almost ran me over!

17:33.320 --> 17:35.155
I fucking thought about it.

17:35.239 --> 17:37.241
George, man,
I don't have time for this, okay?

17:37.324 --> 17:38.659
Not today.
I got a lot of shit I got to do.

17:38.743 --> 17:42.287
Yeah, your boy Dennis called me.
You went out, huh?

17:43.081 --> 17:45.499
Uh-huh. Look.

17:45.583 --> 17:46.876
- Take this.
- Whoa. What the fuck?

17:46.959 --> 17:49.420
No, take it, man.
Save us all a lot of time and energy.

17:49.503 --> 17:52.381
- Look, I...
- Shut the fuck up, would you, Chip?

17:52.464 --> 17:55.509
For once. Take the gun,
put it in your mouth or whatever,

17:55.593 --> 17:57.053
and just spare us all the extra words.

17:59.013 --> 18:01.724
George, I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

18:01.807 --> 18:03.809
No, you don't.
You don't give a fuck about me.

18:03.893 --> 18:05.978
You don't give a fuck
about anything or anybody.

18:06.062 --> 18:09.107
Look, man, it's all under control.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.025
You got it under control?

18:12.068 --> 18:13.402
Oh.

18:13.485 --> 18:15.113
You're all fixed.

18:15.195 --> 18:18.574
You can drink and be normal. This is
just one big wine cooler commercial.

18:18.657 --> 18:21.368
Everything doesn't have to be
one way or another.

18:21.452 --> 18:22.954
You either drink or you don't, Chip.

18:23.037 --> 18:25.664
We don't live
in a black and white world, George.

18:25.748 --> 18:27.416
That's a good one.

18:28.793 --> 18:32.630
I wish I was as smart as you,
'cause you got it all figured out, Chip.

18:32.713 --> 18:35.091
And you do? What?

18:35.174 --> 18:38.552
A fat, obnoxious, know-it-all cop

18:38.636 --> 18:42.723
with alimony payments and two kids
who won't even fucking talk to him?

18:45.643 --> 18:47.979
Where do I sign up for that?

18:48.062 --> 18:50.606
The back of your Wednesday night
men's stag meeting?

18:57.529 --> 18:58.739
[sighs]

19:01.450 --> 19:02.660
Look, I, uh...

19:06.455 --> 19:09.041
You're a good man.

19:09.125 --> 19:13.671
I mean, whether or not you want
to admit it, but... I know you are.

19:16.465 --> 19:20.094
I've seen you stick your hand out...

19:20.178 --> 19:24.182
to help other people,
complete strangers...

19:24.264 --> 19:25.557
drunks.

19:25.641 --> 19:27.726
I mean, countless times.

19:28.519 --> 19:32.231
I just wish you would just listen
to half the stuff you tell them.

19:34.233 --> 19:37.695
I really hope that... that one day
you can just step up, man, and...

19:39.822 --> 19:41.532
and just finally help yourself.

19:46.037 --> 19:50.041
[acoustic rock music playing]

19:50.124 --> 19:52.043
[engine starts and revs]

20:27.578 --> 20:30.664
You lying motherfucker.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.953
[doorbell buzzing]

21:10.788 --> 21:13.291
- Oh. Hey, it's you.
- Is Chip here?

21:13.332 --> 21:15.126
No, he's not.

21:17.044 --> 21:18.212
Come on in.

21:20.256 --> 21:22.674
[people muttering]

21:28.555 --> 21:30.224
Fuckin'...

21:30.308 --> 21:33.978
Chip! Dude! What's up, man?
I thought you'd gone and bailed on us.

21:34.061 --> 21:35.980
Dude, I'm the one
who told you to rally the troops.

21:36.063 --> 21:39.317
Yeah, man, but there are people here
that never show up for anything.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.610
- So, legit Venice people?
- Yeah.

21:41.693 --> 21:44.322
- Hey, man. Is London here?
- I haven't seen her. No.

21:46.324 --> 21:50.786
Whoa, bro. I don't think
I've ever seen you this nervous, man.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.794
So, what brings you to Venice?

21:58.877 --> 22:01.130
I thought this place
was like Chinatown to you.

22:01.213 --> 22:03.715
I need to talk to Chip.
I left him a message, but...

22:03.799 --> 22:05.843
His phone's been off all day.

22:10.222 --> 22:12.766
- I'm concerned.
- Yeah, me too.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.519
It's okay. I know.

22:16.187 --> 22:18.605
- He told you?
- I found out this morning.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.235
- Does anyone else know?
- I left a message for George.

22:23.319 --> 22:26.113
- What would you do that for?
- George can help us.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.073
I guess.

22:33.996 --> 22:36.165
This girl... does she know?

22:36.248 --> 22:39.001
London? I... I doubt it.

22:39.877 --> 22:41.920
I hope you're right.

22:42.004 --> 22:45.299
If she finds out I killed her brother,
then we're both going down.

22:47.426 --> 22:48.468
That you killed...?

22:50.388 --> 22:52.597
You told me you found out this morning.

22:52.681 --> 22:56.768
Yeah, that Chip was drinking again.

22:56.852 --> 22:58.103
Not that he didn't...

23:03.234 --> 23:06.153
- You're saying that you killed...
- Dennis.

23:06.237 --> 23:08.239
What? Oh, fuck.

23:08.322 --> 23:12.492
- Don't make a big deal about this.
- Oh, my God. He fucking lied.

23:13.911 --> 23:15.204
[groaning]

23:15.329 --> 23:17.873
Of course he did.
All he's ever done is lied.

23:17.956 --> 23:21.585
Ever since we first met, everything
that he has ever told me has been a lie.

23:21.668 --> 23:25.256
He didn't... he didn't...
he didn't kill anyone?

23:25.339 --> 23:28.133
- Isn't that better?
- No, not for me.

23:28.217 --> 23:29.634
Who... Who does something like that?

23:29.718 --> 23:32.930
Who the fuck lies
about something like that? Why?

23:33.638 --> 23:35.474
I think he thought
he was doing the right thing.

23:35.557 --> 23:37.017
What?

23:38.727 --> 23:40.229
He took the fall for you.

23:41.355 --> 23:44.942
So that you could have your big career
and that he could...

23:45.025 --> 23:47.819
what, have a fucking furniture store?

23:47.903 --> 23:49.280
That's insane.

23:52.032 --> 23:53.117
[sighs]

23:59.623 --> 24:02.709
This guy is unbelievable.

24:02.793 --> 24:05.212
He wrote the fucking book on bullshit.

24:06.255 --> 24:07.756
At least he says he did.

24:07.839 --> 24:09.300
- [crowd clamoring]
- Listen, please.

24:09.383 --> 24:15.389
The hotel is phase one
of multidimensional rejuvenation project.

24:16.348 --> 24:18.016
We don't want to rejuvenate.

24:18.100 --> 24:19.684
[man] Boo, bro!

24:19.768 --> 24:22.229
We can help you
become the next Santa Monica.

24:22.313 --> 24:24.440
- Boo!
- Up yours!

24:26.191 --> 24:27.485
[gavel pounding]

24:31.363 --> 24:34.992
All right, all right, all right.
You will get a chance to counter,

24:35.075 --> 24:37.577
but you can't all be shouting
at the same time.

24:37.661 --> 24:40.122
Now, do you have a representative?

24:40.205 --> 24:42.666
- Please, tell me that you have...
- Here we go, dude.

24:42.749 --> 24:46.003
- ...some leadership or a leader...
- Take us to the Promised Land.

24:46.086 --> 24:47.671
...so that we're not
sitting here all night

24:47.754 --> 24:50.841
listening to a hundred different versions
of the same objection.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.717
- You got to do this.
- [man] Come on!

24:52.801 --> 24:54.386
We need you, man.

24:54.470 --> 24:56.221
- Come on, man.
- Come on, man, do it!

24:59.850 --> 25:03.521
- [man 2] Speech! Yeah!
- [man 3] Come on, brother.

25:05.939 --> 25:09.067
- Come on, man.
- Come on, tell them like it is, man.

25:09.151 --> 25:10.735
Okay, all right.

25:10.819 --> 25:12.904
[cheering]

25:21.288 --> 25:23.165
Hello, I'm Chip.

25:25.584 --> 25:26.835
And I'm an alcoholic.

25:26.918 --> 25:28.962
[laughter]

25:31.507 --> 25:32.799
[exhales]

25:36.345 --> 25:38.222
I came to Venice by accident.

25:40.891 --> 25:45.062
Let me rephrase that.
I came to Venice because of an accident.

25:46.938 --> 25:50.401
Ten years ago, I killed a man.

25:52.319 --> 25:54.279
A... A boy, really.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.158
There's no excuse for it.

25:59.618 --> 26:02.037
I got loaded.
I got behind the wheel of a car

26:02.120 --> 26:05.165
- and I took another person's life.
- [door opens]

26:06.208 --> 26:07.667
A human being.

26:08.668 --> 26:11.338
And, in the process,
I destroyed what was left of mine.

26:12.964 --> 26:16.093
But the people in this room,

26:16.176 --> 26:20.013
not just those of you who are in A.A.,

26:20.097 --> 26:22.641
you helped me get back on my feet.

26:38.574 --> 26:39.783
I changed.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.745
Venice helped me change.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.792
And, in that time, Venice changed, too.

26:50.294 --> 26:53.255
You know what? When I first got here,

26:53.338 --> 26:59.010
you couldn't walk down Sunset and Fourth
after... ironically enough, sunset.

26:59.094 --> 27:00.679
[chuckling]

27:00.762 --> 27:03.932
No way you could go up
California and Seventh.

27:04.015 --> 27:07.352
Broadway, no.
There were gunshots every day.

27:07.436 --> 27:10.730
You were risking your life
just by sitting in your own living room.

27:13.858 --> 27:15.486
Then, it started to change.

27:16.945 --> 27:19.406
An old ramshackle Craftsman
would come down,

27:19.490 --> 27:22.576
and, in its place,
they'd put up an architectural marvel.

27:24.453 --> 27:27.205
My block would get a little bit safer.

27:27.289 --> 27:30.584
Then, they'd do another one.
They'd open up a new store.

27:31.543 --> 27:33.504
And another store.

27:33.587 --> 27:35.589
A restaurant.

27:37.424 --> 27:39.301
Oscar, I was there the night
that you opened your restaurant.

27:39.384 --> 27:41.761
- How long ago was that?
- Almost eight years.

27:41.845 --> 27:44.473
[cheers and applause]

27:44.556 --> 27:46.684
How many people you got
working for you now, Oscar?

27:46.766 --> 27:49.894
Oh, man, including me?
Uh, sixteen. And my son.

27:49.978 --> 27:52.606
- So, seventeen, 'cause he counts, right?
- [Oscar laughs]

27:54.232 --> 27:55.609
[Chip] We all count.

27:56.568 --> 27:59.404
Seventeen people. Wow.

27:59.488 --> 28:03.701
Seventeen people who...
pay their rent, pay their mortgages,

28:03.783 --> 28:06.453
who spend their money
right here in Venice

28:06.537 --> 28:11.375
all because Oscar had this
preposterous idea to open a restaurant.

28:12.584 --> 28:16.046
Look, I'm not one to usually make a stand.

28:17.339 --> 28:19.633
Shit, I make stools, for Christ's sake.

28:19.717 --> 28:21.801
[crowd chuckles softly]

28:21.885 --> 28:27.891
But I came here today because
I love Venice just as much as you do.

28:36.274 --> 28:38.485
This is a new beginning.

28:40.862 --> 28:42.197
A new chapter for us.

28:44.783 --> 28:49.996
A chance for us to, not forget our past,
but to... to build on it.

28:52.207 --> 28:53.917
So, we can look forward...

28:54.918 --> 28:57.045
to a shared future together.

29:04.052 --> 29:08.348
So, I say to you all today,
yeah, let's save Venice.

29:14.271 --> 29:16.732
Let's look at this regeneration project

29:16.815 --> 29:19.276
as a gift that we didn't even know
we were getting.

29:19.984 --> 29:22.904
Let's welcome these people
into our community...

29:23.822 --> 29:28.410
much the same way
we were welcomed ourselves.

29:31.913 --> 29:33.957
Let's do it! Let's save Venice!

29:34.040 --> 29:36.376
[cheering]

30:00.900 --> 30:02.902
That was a hell of a speech.

30:03.654 --> 30:06.740
- [groans] Yeah. Thank you, man.
- Yeah.

30:06.824 --> 30:11.829
Especially the part about the accident.
That never fails to impress in the rooms.

30:11.911 --> 30:16.667
- Yeah. It's a... it's a good one.
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

30:16.750 --> 30:22.213
You paint such a great picture...
almost as if it really happened.

30:27.761 --> 30:34.142
I got to level with you, man,
'cause you, uh... deserve to know.

30:38.021 --> 30:39.439
It's serious.

30:44.152 --> 30:45.821
I've been drinking again.

30:47.823 --> 30:49.032
Alcohol.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.367
Uh-huh.

30:52.494 --> 30:54.287
Probably about 18 months.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.456
Not a lot.

30:58.375 --> 30:59.793
More than nothing.

31:02.754 --> 31:06.966
And I've been drinking
some of your wine.

31:09.219 --> 31:10.470
Sorry, man. I'm...

31:12.597 --> 31:13.973
I know I let you down.

31:15.475 --> 31:16.894
Is that it?

31:18.937 --> 31:22.065
Well, yeah. I mean, that's kind of a lot.

31:25.026 --> 31:28.655
- Is this about the jacket?
- No, man. It's not about the jacket.

31:30.073 --> 31:31.115
It's about the accident.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.326
What about it?

31:36.580 --> 31:38.289
Tell me what happened.

31:39.082 --> 31:42.001
- You know what happened.
- I know what you told me.

31:46.214 --> 31:47.591
Then, that's what happened.

31:51.636 --> 31:53.346
You can tell me the truth, Chip.

31:55.807 --> 31:57.768
- I've told you the truth.
- Okay.

31:57.851 --> 32:00.771
Then, tell me the truth about the truth.

32:00.854 --> 32:06.150
- It's the same as it's always been.
- Tell me... what happened.

32:15.452 --> 32:17.078
All right, man.

32:17.161 --> 32:20.290
I guess this is it... for us.

32:22.751 --> 32:25.629
Dennis, what are you talking about?

32:25.712 --> 32:27.171
You did it, Chip.

32:28.966 --> 32:30.133
You won.

32:31.342 --> 32:32.552
You got it.

32:33.553 --> 32:36.139
- Got what?
- Everything.

32:41.144 --> 32:43.480
Everything that you ever wanted.
