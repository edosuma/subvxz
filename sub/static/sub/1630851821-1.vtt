WEBVTT

05:03.236 --> 05:05.571
Good morning, Lieutenant
Good morning, Colonel.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.041
Good morning.

05:15.048 --> 05:19.052
Those pictures you're looking a
are from ten years ago,

05:19.118 --> 05:23.089
the last time a security agenc
reported seen codename Matías

05:23.156 --> 05:25.892
when he was still the nation'
most wanted man.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.162
Gentlemen,

05:29.862 --> 05:32.765
our glorious police departmen
presumed he was killed

05:32.832 --> 05:34.934
while trying to capture him.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.837
But now we have an informe
who reported

05:37.904 --> 05:41.741
codename Matías is still aliv
and rearming.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.711
We can't let him organiz
another army,

05:44.777 --> 05:47.847
so now that we've located him,

05:47.914 --> 05:50.883
we need to clean u
the police department's mess.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.853
A recon uni
has been following a gang

05:53.920 --> 05:55.288
for the past two weeks,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.557
which is due to mee
with codename Matías.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.093
The last time he was seen

06:00.159 --> 06:03.329
was right here
on the other side of the border.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.766
A wild are
with reports of raids

06:06.833 --> 06:08.334
and missing people.

06:08.401 --> 06:11.671
Our neighbors won't allo
any military personnel in,

06:11.738 --> 06:13.573
and they won't do anythin
either.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.342
Who's the "gringo"?

06:18.177 --> 06:19.746
No idea.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.983
Codename Matía
is a top priority target.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.918
Your missio
is to neutralize him.

06:26.185 --> 06:30.757
Our Special Forces Eagle Uni
under Captain Giménez

06:30.823 --> 06:32.725
is in charge of neutralizing him

06:32.792 --> 06:36.696
while the rapid deployment tea
under Captain Gracia

06:36.763 --> 06:39.399
will be in charge of protectin
his rear guard.

06:39.932 --> 06:41.701
After the target is neutralized,

06:41.768 --> 06:44.404
you'll be evacuate
from this extraction point.

06:45.538 --> 06:48.074
We can only risk it once.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.410
If you miss the chopper,

06:50.476 --> 06:53.679
you'll need to get to the borde
by your own means.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.517
And while you're on foreign soi
you're on your own.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.420
We don't kno
what he looks like now,

07:00.486 --> 07:03.623
so when you get ther
you need to send us photos

07:03.689 --> 07:07.026
until our informe
positively identifies Matías.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.628
As soon as he's identified,

07:08.694 --> 07:11.164
you'll have direct order
to neutralize him.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.299
SPECIAL FORCES

07:13.366 --> 07:14.534
Major.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.270
Thanks, Colonel
Good day, boys.

07:17.336 --> 07:18.404
Good day, sir.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.726
-How are you feeling
-Fine, Doc.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.030
Any difficulty moving?

07:45.031 --> 07:46.666
No.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.736
Higher. Any pain?

07:54.373 --> 07:55.741
Pressure on the outside?

07:55.808 --> 07:58.511
-No
-No? Fine. Get up.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.215
Any discomfort?

08:03.282 --> 08:05.685
-None, Doc
-Stress?

08:11.190 --> 08:13.159
Working out a lot?

08:14.694 --> 08:16.295
Pull ups once in a while, Doc.

08:18.498 --> 08:23.402
L-P-E-F-O-D-P.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.571
What happened to your arm?

08:27.406 --> 08:30.243
-He came at me with a machete
-And?

08:30.309 --> 08:33.379
I grabbed it after a while
Do I continue or what?

08:33.980 --> 08:35.348
Facing me again.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.084
Where are your scars?

08:38.150 --> 08:41.354
I'm lucky. They call m
Trébol, Doc.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.890
-Does it hurt if I press here
-No.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.292
-How's your leg
-Perfect, Doctor.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.494
Any pain right here?

08:49.662 --> 08:50.730
No, Doctor.

08:51.764 --> 08:53.799
-Any pain
-No.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.237
-Any pain
-No.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.172
Lower.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.675
Stop.

09:02.742 --> 09:03.676
Lower.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.246
Bend down. Any pain?

09:16.255 --> 09:17.757
Stretch your arms out.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.036
How long you been like that?

09:30.803 --> 09:32.305
-How
-Like that.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.975
I had a lot of coffee
I'm kind of jumpy.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.810
Can you control it?

09:39.111 --> 09:40.079
Show me.

09:47.453 --> 09:48.788
Is this a regular thing?

09:50.723 --> 09:52.391
Only when I have coffee.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.037
So, how did it go?

10:05.571 --> 10:08.407
That bastard docto
hates my guts.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.844
You're in a hurry to get shot
you idiot?

10:12.378 --> 10:15.147
I'd rather get sho
than be bored stiff here, bro.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.682
That's true.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.986
See you, guys.

10:30.029 --> 10:30.997
You okay?

10:36.268 --> 10:37.436
I'm okay.

10:40.673 --> 10:43.409
Just tell me this. Is it hot?

10:44.977 --> 10:45.945
Cold?

10:47.847 --> 10:52.284
Talk to me. That's not a secret
I'm not asking where you are.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.586
Warm.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.658
Warm? I know you'll hang u
and go look for girls in town.

10:59.525 --> 11:03.829
-Yes, we're getting dressed
-Hey! Watch it!

11:04.130 --> 11:06.265
Okay, got to get some sleep.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.301
I love you very much.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.844
Look at him. There he is.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.513
Is he sleeping with you?

11:21.013 --> 11:24.050
No, I'm going to put hi
in his crib.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.024
I have to get some sleep.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.294
Take care. I love you.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.113
What's up?

11:55.948 --> 11:57.683
I called to say goodbye.

13:00.646 --> 13:03.549
No! Let me go!

13:05.951 --> 13:10.556
Leave me alone! Get out!

13:12.892 --> 13:17.396
No! My brother! My brother!

13:17.930 --> 13:19.365
My brother!

13:25.638 --> 13:27.840
Hi, I'm Amparo. And you?

13:27.907 --> 13:30.776
-Let me go! Let me go
-Let's go.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.848
Let me go! Let me go!

13:36.749 --> 13:39.285
Let me go! Let me go!

13:42.321 --> 13:43.756
Leave me alone!

13:44.190 --> 13:46.892
No! Leave me alone!

13:53.299 --> 13:55.367
What will they do to my sister?

20:43.375 --> 20:44.309
Captain.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.346
Lieutenant, everything okay?

20:48.714 --> 20:50.882
We're cold and hungry, but okay.

20:53.051 --> 20:56.054
We followed three peopl
for almost two weeks

20:56.121 --> 20:57.723
until they finally came here.

20:58.657 --> 21:02.294
They left some bags behind
I guess it's cash.

21:04.663 --> 21:07.466
We haven't seen Matías
but several guys

21:07.532 --> 21:10.168
go in and out of the big ten
reporting to someone.

21:10.869 --> 21:13.138
Since yesterda
they've been pretty active.

21:13.972 --> 21:14.906
Thanks.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.179
Who are the Indians?

21:21.246 --> 21:23.181
They've been ther
since we got here.

21:23.682 --> 21:24.750
Natives?

21:26.785 --> 21:29.087
No idea
I never saw anything like that.

21:33.859 --> 21:36.194
Did they find the two present
we left them?

21:37.796 --> 21:39.331
Only those two were here?

21:39.398 --> 21:40.666
Yes, Captain.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.469
We looked for guards
but it's just them.

21:47.272 --> 21:49.741
Okay, there's a river.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.444
Just two klicks away
CTS 1000 Southwest.

21:53.845 --> 21:57.282
It's a good regrouping poin
if things get ugly.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.017
It's wide but we can cross it.

21:59.885 --> 22:00.819
Sergeant,

22:01.720 --> 22:03.789
give the guys the coordinates.

22:04.222 --> 22:05.490
Regrouping point...

22:05.924 --> 22:06.992
CTS 1000.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.960
Copy that. Ladies,

22:09.928 --> 22:12.097
your regrouping poin
is CTS 1000.

22:13.131 --> 22:14.232
Rojas, Díaz,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.101

22:21.239 --> 22:23.575
-Good job
-Thanks, Captain.

22:23.642 --> 22:25.510
-Get some rest and food
-Okay.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.714
Costa, Flaco, Ponce,

22:28.780 --> 22:31.516
Cortez, Mono, Indio
left flank with me.

22:31.583 --> 22:34.119
-Ramos, you're with the others
-Okay.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.609
South winds at 13 kph.

23:02.681 --> 23:03.715
Everything okay?

23:06.585 --> 23:07.552
Have some water.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.005
What about me, you bastard?

23:32.010 --> 23:32.911
I knew it.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.352
Díaz.

23:41.386 --> 23:44.589
Watch out for the monkeys
They'll steal your gear.

23:59.971 --> 24:00.906
Reading?

24:02.541 --> 24:05.043
10-30. 120 meters.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.447
10-30.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.516
120 meters.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.394
When did you last go home?

24:27.265 --> 24:28.533
Rosario kicked me out.

24:32.270 --> 24:36.041
Grandpa, Eagle 6

24:50.689 --> 24:53.758
-Go ahead, Grandpa
-How's it going, Captain?

24:54.226 --> 24:57.329
Everything's okay
We're already in the nest.

24:57.596 --> 25:00.565
We set up cam
at about 200 meters from them.

25:00.866 --> 25:03.535
-Have you identified Matías?
-Negative.

25:04.102 --> 25:05.637
How many are there, Captain?

25:06.371 --> 25:10.876
Approximately 15 to 20 me
and a few Indians.

25:12.077 --> 25:14.613
-Indians?
-Affirmative.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.682
Upload photos of al

-Good luck, Captain.

25:20.819 --> 25:22.988
Thank you. Eagle over and out.

25:53.418 --> 25:54.553

26:15.574 --> 26:16.675

26:18.276 --> 26:21.012
3-30. 120 meters.

26:29.821 --> 26:30.889
Check.

26:36.361 --> 26:38.330
I got movement down there
Captain.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.833
Proceed to your positions.

26:47.872 --> 26:51.076
All eyes on the tents
Confirm Matías' identity.

26:56.748 --> 26:58.183
2 o'clock, Pardo.

27:12.097 --> 27:14.032
I see a woma
and two bodyguards.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.103
-Can you identify Matías?
-Negative.

27:19.871 --> 27:20.805
Negative.

27:25.276 --> 27:28.913
A possible Matías at 11 o'cloc
between two bodyguards.

27:29.948 --> 27:31.016
Are you sure?

27:32.651 --> 27:33.618
No.

27:41.259 --> 27:42.661
Upload that.

27:50.368 --> 27:52.337
I'm aiming at him
but he's moving.

27:58.877 --> 28:00.078
Grandpa, Eagle 6.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.516
Grandpa, Eagle 6
5-8-3 Golf Zulu.

28:07.318 --> 28:10.855

Can you see from another angle?

28:33.111 --> 28:35.013
I can't
This is my best position.

28:36.181 --> 28:37.148
Negative.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.789
Captain, all clear to proceed.

28:45.690 --> 28:46.624
Rojas.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.461
All clear to proceed
Repeat, proceed.

28:58.970 --> 29:01.306
-Confirm death
-Confirmed.

29:02.107 --> 29:03.374
Blew his brains out.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.778
Gracia, eyes down there.

29:07.245 --> 29:11.449
Copy that, Jiménez, copy that
Let's go. Get ready.

29:12.217 --> 29:13.685
Sergeant, do you copy?

29:15.787 --> 29:18.690
Costa, Mono, go and se
what happened with the Sergeant.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.158
Immediately, Captain.

29:57.529 --> 29:58.863
Do you copy me, Captain?

29:58.930 --> 30:00.965
It's an ambush, Captain.

30:01.566 --> 30:04.569
-We're being ambushed
-Red alert. Red alert.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.473
Recon, rear flank.

30:17.282 --> 30:18.650
Anybody got a target?

30:19.117 --> 30:21.085
-Negative.
-Negative.

30:22.754 --> 30:26.291
Fire only at a confirmed target
Save your ammo.

30:30.695 --> 30:31.830
What the hell is it?

30:41.172 --> 30:42.407
Contact at 10 o'clock.

30:44.075 --> 30:45.376
There's something here.

30:47.212 --> 30:48.513
They're surrounding us.

31:05.964 --> 31:08.066
I see something
They're surrounding us!

31:09.400 --> 31:10.668
Contact!

31:19.544 --> 31:21.079
Break contact. Break contact.

31:58.683 --> 31:59.851
Go! Go! Go!

32:13.298 --> 32:16.567
Split up, regroup at CPS 1000.

32:33.918 --> 32:34.986
Costa.

32:35.053 --> 32:35.987
Costa!

32:38.489 --> 32:39.590
It's okay.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.293
Costa, it's me, Rojas.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.530
Hey, wake up. Go, go, go!

Marking our position.

34:43.381 --> 34:45.616
I'm here, bro
Let's go. Let's go.

34:49.987 --> 34:51.122

34:54.192 --> 34:56.260

34:56.327 --> 34:58.663
Don't do it, you dumb ass
Dumb ass.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.466
-Everything's okay
-What are you doing?

35:04.502 --> 35:05.703
Let's go.

35:18.015 --> 35:19.250
Bro!

35:19.584 --> 35:21.119
Jackson, take him away!

35:22.019 --> 35:23.254
Bro!

35:55.052 --> 35:56.053
Coming in!

35:59.557 --> 36:00.658
Right here.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.100
It's okay. It's okay.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.401
Don't shoot.

36:13.204 --> 36:17.441
Calm down, Trébol, it's okay
Breathe. Breathe.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.010
It's okay. Calm down.

36:19.076 --> 36:20.444
I'm coming. Don't shoot.

36:20.778 --> 36:23.281
It's okay. Calm down. Calm down.

36:24.715 --> 36:25.650
Calm down.

36:31.956 --> 36:34.258
-Anybody else coming
-No.

36:35.259 --> 36:39.096
There must be more guys
Giménez? Anybody saw Giménez?

36:39.597 --> 36:42.533
The sarge got blown up
They ambushed Baracus.

36:44.068 --> 36:46.504
-What about the Cobras
-Just us.

36:51.242 --> 36:52.510
Orders, Captain?

36:57.215 --> 36:58.149
Captain!

36:59.383 --> 37:00.318
Gracia!

37:02.787 --> 37:04.188
Take this off.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.328
Let's go. Let's go.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.429
Quiet, Trébol!

37:11.495 --> 37:12.697
Move it!

37:12.763 --> 37:13.998
I cover you!

37:14.065 --> 37:15.666
Move it! Hurry up!

37:15.733 --> 37:16.801
Come on, guys!

37:26.777 --> 37:27.778
Go ahead!

37:45.062 --> 37:46.197
Jump!

38:03.314 --> 38:04.248
Let's go!

38:50.161 --> 38:53.130
-Where's Gracia and the Cobras
-They're still in there.

38:58.402 --> 38:59.870
I see caves over there.

39:02.139 --> 39:03.941
Easy, easy. Breathe.

39:07.144 --> 39:08.479
Move it.

39:08.746 --> 39:10.214
Rojas, you're in charge.

39:12.983 --> 39:13.984
Corporal.

39:15.953 --> 39:16.887
Corporal.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.190
Let's go.

40:00.831 --> 40:01.766
Go. Go.

41:04.161 --> 41:05.329
What's wrong?

41:52.176 --> 41:55.412
I found something
What is this shithole?

42:35.986 --> 42:37.755
What the hell is this?

42:47.464 --> 42:50.401
SPECIAL FORCES

43:12.690 --> 43:14.224
Can I help you, ma'am?

43:17.561 --> 43:20.230
It's a good thin
you had to stay here.

43:21.832 --> 43:24.902
Or you'd be dea
like your comrades.
