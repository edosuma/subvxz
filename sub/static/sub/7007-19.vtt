00:05.739 --> 00:09.175
Welcome back to our
St. Patrick's Day Tool Time.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.369
And our salute to everything Irish.

00:11.444 --> 00:14.607
There once was a lad from Nantucket...

00:14.681 --> 00:15.943
Tim.

00:16.850 --> 00:21.287
First off, thanks to Seamus O'Connor for
showing his antique Waterford crystal.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.878
- It's priceless.
- Yeah.

00:25.191 --> 00:28.558
And somewhat fragile.
Sorry, Seamus.

00:28.628 --> 00:30.186
Thank you, Seamus.

00:31.197 --> 00:35.361
You knew this was a possibility
when you came on the show.

00:35.468 --> 00:39.131
A little later on in the show, we're
gonna repaint this little table.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.572
This beautiful Irish coffee table.
And I'm gonna use Kelly green.

00:42.642 --> 00:45.611
And I'm gonna finish
tatting this lovely Irish lace.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.078
Very McMann-ly, Al.

00:48.314 --> 00:51.477
Before we get to that, we have
some very special guests for you.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.782
That's right. Nobody knows how
to celebrate St. Patrick's Day

00:54.854 --> 00:56.082
like the working man.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.886
And we're talking about
the working men from Bay City.

00:58.958 --> 01:02.416
Let's give a warm welcome to the boys
from K&B: Rock, Pete and Dwayne!

01:10.670 --> 01:14.128
Hi. It's great to
have you guys here.

01:14.207 --> 01:16.471
Always great to be here, Timmy!

01:16.543 --> 01:19.512
I guess you guys really know
how to party on St. Patty's Day.

01:19.612 --> 01:21.910
That's right.
It's a big holiday up at K&B.

01:21.981 --> 01:26.714
It's right up there with
Christmas and Friday.

01:26.786 --> 01:31.155
Since St. Patty's falls on a Tuesday,
how do you find time to celebrate?

01:31.257 --> 01:34.818
It is a challenging dilemma.
But being skilled craftspersons,

01:34.894 --> 01:39.456
we've designed our own accouterments
for just such a situation.

01:39.532 --> 01:43.832
Well, your accouterments look
suspiciously like just a green tool box.

01:43.903 --> 01:47.395
Well, to the untrained eye, Tim.
Open her up.

01:50.009 --> 01:53.445
- Aww...
- Voila. A traditional Irish feast.

01:53.513 --> 01:56.744
- Look at that. Corned beef and cabbage.
- Yeah, you betcha.

01:56.816 --> 01:58.579
And look down in this compartment.

01:58.651 --> 02:04.021
Instead of your nails and screws,
you got your spuds and stews.

02:04.124 --> 02:08.890
- It's a little oily there.
- That's where we keep the WD-40.

02:13.199 --> 02:16.726
Well, so much for the food portion
of our St. Patty's Day celebration.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.704
Why don't you tell the audience
why you really came down?

02:19.772 --> 02:22.536
During breaks up on the high steel,

02:22.609 --> 02:25.908
we like to sing traditional
Irish folk songs.

02:25.979 --> 02:30.541
I love Irish music.
It's magically delicious.

02:31.351 --> 02:34.843
And I like it, too!

02:35.822 --> 02:38.154
Well, perhaps then we should regale you

02:38.224 --> 02:42.786
<i>with one of our most captivating numbers
entitled Mountain Dew.</i>

02:42.896 --> 02:45.364
Go ahead.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.558
- Heidi, my guitar.
- All rightie.

02:47.634 --> 02:50.728
- Here you go, laddie.
- Thank you, lassie.

02:50.803 --> 02:53.033
Ladies and gentlemen,
the boys from K&B.

03:01.147 --> 03:05.174
<i>* Let grasses grow and waters flow
in a free and easy way</i>

03:05.251 --> 03:09.312
<i>* Just give me enough of that fine old
stuff that's made near Galway Bay</i>

03:09.389 --> 03:13.416
<i>* The police men
from old Donegal Sligo and Lietrin too</i>

03:13.493 --> 03:18.021
<i>* We'll give them the slip and we'll
take a sip Of that real old Mountain Dew</i>

03:18.097 --> 03:20.395
<i>* Ah didlee ay dum
Ah diddlee ay dum...</i>

03:20.466 --> 03:23.196
Hey, Al...
Al, watch for that oil there...

03:24.337 --> 03:26.669
<i>* Ah doo ray diddlee ai ay *</i>

03:26.739 --> 03:28.798
Happy St. Patty's Day!

03:34.214 --> 03:37.843
Ladies and gentlemen,
the boys from K&B.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.915
And Al Green.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:32.705 --> 04:33.672
Tim?

04:33.773 --> 04:36.867
Where are you? I thought you were
gonna help me with these bulbs.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.844
I'll help you with those bulbs,
all right.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.476
- What is that?
- It's my bulb blaster.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.414
Is this really necessary?

04:45.485 --> 04:48.648
Probably not. But it's gonna
be a lot of fun. Now, stand up.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.756
OK. Stand back.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.960
It's tulip time in Beijing.
Look at that.

05:02.001 --> 05:04.868
Well, top o' the morning to you,
Taylor twosome.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.063
Good morning.

05:06.139 --> 05:10.371
I wanted to bring you a basket of St.
Patrick's Day goodies before I leave.

05:10.443 --> 05:13.276
Thank you. What a nice thing to do.
Where are you going?

05:13.346 --> 05:17.305
I'm spending three days with my
good friend Sean McCormack in Dublin.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.851
You're going to Ireland
for just three days?

05:19.919 --> 05:20.943
Dublin, Ohio.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.147
Then the three days'll be plenty,
won't it?

05:23.222 --> 05:27.181
No. It's very good timing since my house
is gonna be filled with nerve gas.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.562
- I thought he said nerve gas.
- So did I.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.929
Well, I did. I did. I'm trying
to get rid of the bats in my attic.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.165
You know, I've tried every other way.
But, alas, it comes down to gas.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.503
It always does... always does.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.907
Thank you again for these.
Have a good time.

05:44.977 --> 05:49.346
There's something bothering me. My niece
still hasn't got a place to stay.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.576
I thought she had tons of friends.

05:51.651 --> 05:55.143
Well, yes. But have you met them?
They're wild. They're irresponsible.

05:55.221 --> 05:59.282
I know it's a big favor, but could
Willow stay with you for three days?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.020
I would love that.

06:05.631 --> 06:09.499
In fact, I'd like to trade her for Tim.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.036
Hi.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.332
- Hey.
- Hi, Willow.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.635
Uncle Wilson, the guy
with the gas is here.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.675
And I may have a lead
on a place to stay.

06:16.743 --> 06:19.211
Tim and I talked.
We'd like you to stay with us.

06:19.278 --> 06:21.246
Oh, I wouldn't want to put anybody out.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.907
You wouldn't be.
We'll have the boys double up.

06:23.983 --> 06:27.441
If that doesn't work,
Jill and I will double up.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.953
So, what do you think?

06:29.021 --> 06:32.582
I'd be happy to stay... provided
your husband puts down his weapon.

06:33.493 --> 06:37.361
I have a constitutional right
to bear these bulbs.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.261
I'll get my stuff.
I'll be right back.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.890
- Great.
- OK.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.128
Well, hi-ho, Nick.

06:43.202 --> 06:47.434
Oh, is that Nick the exterminator?
Nick, the nerve gas guy. What's shaking?

06:47.507 --> 06:50.442
His entire body.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.812
Willow, thanks for making us dinner.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.178
Oh, it's delicious.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.412
Making dinner's fun when
you get to cook for people you like.

06:59.519 --> 07:03.819
Mmm... maybe that's been my
problem all along.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.825
I love this Moroccan food.
You get to eat with your fingers.

07:06.893 --> 07:10.021
How's that different from the way
you normally eat?

07:10.096 --> 07:12.963
He licks his fingers a lot more.

07:13.399 --> 07:16.163
I love squab. Mm.

07:17.804 --> 07:21.501
No kidding. You've practically
eaten the entire flock.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.940
I appreciate your asking
me to stay with you.

07:24.010 --> 07:27.571
And tomorrow if anyone needs a massage,
I brought my table.

07:27.647 --> 07:28.875
Oh, me. I'll go...

07:28.948 --> 07:33.885
Hey, guys! Guys. Don't be rude.
Me first.

07:33.953 --> 07:37.047
I guess we should start to clean up.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.023
I love her.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.357
When she's around, these boys start
acting... What is it? Human?

07:43.429 --> 07:47.525
Mm-hm. I really like having
another woman in the house.

07:47.600 --> 07:53.368
It's OK for you. But when I want another
woman in the house; no, no, no...

07:53.473 --> 07:56.442
Oh, man. Look at the time.
You know what? I gotta call a cab.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.066
Where are you going?

07:58.144 --> 08:00.510
- I'm meeting some friends at a club.
- Cool.

08:00.580 --> 08:04.414
- Any idea what time you'll be back?
- Mmm, probably around midnight.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.612
Midnight? You shouldn't be out
looking for a cab that late.

08:07.687 --> 08:11.453
- We should lend her one of our cars.
- Too bad they all have flats.

08:11.557 --> 08:14.048
Here. Here. Take mine. Take my Healey.

08:14.126 --> 08:17.493
That is really great. Thanks a lot,
Jill. Bye, guys.

08:17.597 --> 08:18.655
See ya.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.824
Be careful.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.425
Keep a close eye on that oil gauge.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.063
Two centimeters to the left
means you need oil.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.640
Try to find an English mechanic
if you can.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.672
OK, Mom and Dad, you guys
can take it from here.

08:32.745 --> 08:37.205
Aw, man. They are such show-offs.
The girl leaves, they bail.

08:37.283 --> 08:40.844
Well, we have to rest up
for our massages tomorrow.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.251
Hold on a second, guys.

08:43.322 --> 08:48.282
Finish those dishes or Daddy'll give you
a massage with the ol' bulb blaster.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.130
What are you still doing up?

08:54.200 --> 08:58.159
It's two o'clock. Willow's still
not back. What are you doing up?

08:58.237 --> 09:01.570
That Moroccan food was a bit spicy.

09:01.641 --> 09:05.099
That Marrakech Express has been
running all night.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.412
I wonder if something's
going on with Willow.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.973
I've seen girls like her in counseling.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.509
Because they don't have a parental
role model, they lack direction.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.148
They get lost and stay that way
all their lives.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.749
Excuse me.

09:20.826 --> 09:24.057
You came up with that based on
the fact that she's two hours late?

09:24.130 --> 09:27.065
No. I came up with that theory
the minute I met her.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.465
Never had the opportunity
to obsess about it.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.400
Honey, don't do this.

09:31.470 --> 09:34.303
First, she's not our daughter
and she's 26 years old.

09:34.373 --> 09:38.469
Second, she's always lived liked this.
She's doing pretty well at it.

09:38.544 --> 09:41.911
Have you seen people who seem OK,
but inside they're racked with pain?

09:45.484 --> 09:48.453
You are singing to the choir.

09:50.389 --> 09:51.549
Hi, Tim. Hi, Jill.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.114
- Hi, Willow.
- Oh, hi.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.126
You werert waiting for me, were you?

09:55.194 --> 09:58.220
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm a real night owl.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.458
I love the night life;
I love to boogie.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.726
Well, I have other issues.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.466
So, what was it like?
Did you have fun at the club?

10:07.540 --> 10:11.704
The bouncer wouldn't let my friend Dirk
in because he didn't like his pants.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.904
And I tell Dirk, "Take them off."

10:13.980 --> 10:17.848
So he takes them off. Then other guys
take them off. And they all get in.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.416
Where do we keep the barium?

10:20.486 --> 10:23.114
Tim, put a cork in it.

10:26.292 --> 10:30.456
Well, there's an idea.
Where do we keep the corks?

10:30.529 --> 10:32.258
Upstairs in the attic.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.356
- Goodnight, Willow.
- Goodnight, Tim.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.695
It's two o'clock.
Who'd be calling at this hour?

10:38.804 --> 10:41.272
That's probably for me.

10:41.340 --> 10:45.299
Hi. How is it going, Dirk?

10:45.411 --> 10:49.074
Sure. Yeah.
I'll see you there. Bye.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.513
Well, I am off.

10:50.616 --> 10:52.982
- Where are you going?
- Out to breakfast.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.144
You sure it's safe
to go out at this hour?

10:55.221 --> 10:59.590
Yeah. Well, I appreciate your concern,
Jill. But I'll be fine. I'm not a kid.

10:59.692 --> 11:03.059
It's not a matter of how old you are.
I wouldn't go out this late.

11:03.162 --> 11:06.928
Well, you also wouldn't get
a bunch of men to take off their pants.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.661
Not now. But when I retire,
I'll need a hobby.

11:09.735 --> 11:12.431
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:16.308 --> 11:19.209
Honey, on your way up
grab the stick matches.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.816
Well, it's almost noon and Willow's not
back. This is getting serious.

11:27.887 --> 11:31.152
You're right. That Healey's
gonna need some oil.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.986
Will you forget about the car?

11:33.059 --> 11:34.788
OK, let's get this straight.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.352
After she got home, she went
out to breakfast with that guy Dirk.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.400
- Dirk was the guy that she...
- took off his pants at the club.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.728
Ah, to be young again...

11:44.303 --> 11:47.466
I'm concerned. What if
something bad has happened to her?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.804
Nothing bad happened to her.
Come on.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.174
We'll tell her if she wants to
stay out all night, give us a call.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.270
I'll let her use my cell phone.

11:59.351 --> 12:02.843
Hello? Hello, Dirk.

12:02.922 --> 12:08.792
We were just talking about you.
A little drafty today, are we?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.893
Why would Willow be here?

12:13.099 --> 12:18.594
Really. Well, yeah. If she gets back,
I'll have her call you. Bye.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.196
- What did he say?
- He said Willow never showed up.

12:21.273 --> 12:24.800
He's a little worried about her, too.
I should have gotten his number.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.902
Oh, God.

12:26.979 --> 12:31.541
Wilson asked us to look after Willow.
After one night, she's missing.

12:31.617 --> 12:34.643
Wait, you lost Wilsors niece?

12:34.720 --> 12:38.053
We didn't lose her.
We just don't know where to find her.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.527
Oh, my God.
We've lost Wilsors niece.

12:47.633 --> 12:51.000
OK. You guys think you have any
idea where Willow is?

12:51.070 --> 12:53.630
- Maybe she's at a friend's house.
- Could be working.

12:53.706 --> 12:57.164
Maybe she fell in a big hole
and can't get out.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.747
What? It could happen.

13:04.817 --> 13:08.981
We gotta find that guy Dirk's phone
number. How are we gonna do that?

13:09.088 --> 13:12.546
Maybe she has an address book.
She's been staying in Brad's room.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.889
- We should check there.
- Or at Wilsors.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.259
Wilsors house is being bombed with
nerve gas. Who's gonna go in?

13:22.168 --> 13:25.296
Woo! Ow!

13:30.376 --> 13:32.105
Take off the mask.

13:33.445 --> 13:37.745
What a rush! Walking through dark,
poison-filled hallways.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.844
A mission where it could cost me my
life! It was unbelievable! It was great!

13:41.921 --> 13:45.857
Dad, are you sure that mask
is completely leak-proof?

13:45.925 --> 13:48.416
Who said that?

13:52.097 --> 13:56.158
Well, OK. If she turns up, you know
where to call. Thanks. Bye.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.534
I've checked the police,
the emergency rooms, and the hospital.

13:59.605 --> 14:03.541
- You found the address book!
- Better yet, her day planner.

14:03.609 --> 14:05.702
DayMinder. Oh, look at this.

14:05.778 --> 14:09.612
There's names and addresses. There's
gotta be something that'll help us.

14:09.682 --> 14:14.051
<i>Hey, look. It's a receipt from a
place called Just Jam and Jelly.</i>

14:14.119 --> 14:17.350
And on the 15th she went to
a body-piercing parlor.

14:17.423 --> 14:21.587
Hey, that's pretty cool. Three more
visits and she gets a free tongue stud.

14:21.660 --> 14:25.221
Look, there's pictures of Willow
taken at one of those photo booths.

14:25.331 --> 14:30.428
You guys could go to these places.
Find out if anybody has seen her.

14:30.502 --> 14:33.266
I'll go with you, Mark.
Randy, you go with Brad.

14:33.372 --> 14:37.001
Here. And I'll just stay here
and see if she calls.

14:37.076 --> 14:42.810
Look at this. She spent a lot of
money at Great Value Hardware.

14:42.882 --> 14:47.945
You go to the hardware store.
You go to the body-piercing parlor.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.318
Oh, man!

14:54.193 --> 14:58.823
Well, call me if she turns up, OK?
Thanks.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.059
Hi. Did you find out anything?

15:01.133 --> 15:05.001
I found that even though the Healey's
an English car, I still miss it.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.164
No. Did you find anything
out about Willow?

15:08.240 --> 15:13.872
Yes. I stopped by Just Herbs. It seems
Willow has a thing for ginkgo biloba.

15:13.946 --> 15:19.907
According to her psychic, Janice, in a
past life, Willow was Vincent Van Gogh.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.151
In other words, you found out nothing.

15:22.221 --> 15:26.681
No. I found out in a past life
I was Mary, Queen of Scots.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.126
Brad and Randy called.
They don't know anything either.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.789
Let's think.
Assuming that Willow is OK,

15:32.898 --> 15:36.629
what would motivate her to stay
out all night and not call?

15:36.702 --> 15:40.832
She wants attention. She's acting out.
All of this is just a cry for help.

15:40.906 --> 15:46.344
Maybe there's another explanation.
She's really inconsiderate.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.141
I don't think it's that simple.

15:48.213 --> 15:51.944
Sure is. She takes the car and doesn't
bother calling. What's that about?

15:52.017 --> 15:55.748
I'm sticking with the big-hole theory.

15:55.821 --> 15:58.756
What are you suggesting?
Should we stop looking for her?

15:58.824 --> 16:01.657
The boys and I have spent
all day looking. She's nowhere.

16:01.727 --> 16:04.161
We haven't checked the clubs.

16:04.229 --> 16:06.754
We're going clubbing? All right!

16:06.832 --> 16:09.596
You can't go to the clubs.
You're not old enough.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.363
Well, what am I supposed to do?

16:11.437 --> 16:14.338
Find a big hole and wait till you're 21.

16:18.177 --> 16:23.479
Another club. I have enough stamps
on my hand to mail myself to Caracas.

16:23.549 --> 16:26.017
Let's try this last place
and then we'll go home.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.918
I'm not waiting in line.
Tell them it's an emergency.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.250
- OK.
- Get us in.

16:30.322 --> 16:34.156
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Uh, this is
an emergency. You have to let us in.

16:34.226 --> 16:37.753
We're searching for a missing person.
Her name is Willow.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.857
<i>She's about five-foot-three.
She has reddishlblondishlbrownish hair.</i>

16:41.934 --> 16:44.425
She sounds like this.
Hi.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.232
Just go in. Just go in.

16:46.305 --> 16:47.932
- Thanks a lot.
- Wait. Not you.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.272
- I'm with her.
- Yeah. But she is cool.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.605
Stay here, I'll be back.

16:52.678 --> 16:56.774
Hold on. Apparently, you don't know who
I am. I'm Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.410
And I'm Lance "I Hate Your Show" Smith.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.922
Excuse me. Do you know a girl
named Willow Wilson?

17:06.992 --> 17:09.551
Yeah. Willow.
Too bad what happened to her.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.289
Oh, my God. What happened?

17:11.363 --> 17:16.323
Her uncle left town and she had to crash
with a really straight suburban family.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.007
Uh, you two, come on in.

17:22.273 --> 17:25.038
What kind of a line is this?
I was here before they were.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.667
This isn't a line.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.804
The bouncer picks who gets to go in.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.678
You know, I think tonight
is my lucky night.

17:32.751 --> 17:36.710
It's gonna happen for you.
You know, I can feel it.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.517
What a loser.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.081
- So, Lance, you like football?
- Yeah.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.492
I got connections with
the owner of the Lions.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.527
- I played for the Lions.
- Yeah?

17:46.598 --> 17:47.963
They cut me.

17:48.067 --> 17:53.232
Yeah, look what happened to them.
Oh, boy.

17:59.144 --> 18:02.079
OK, everybody, it's swing time.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.775
Say, good-looking, let's dance.

18:05.851 --> 18:10.481
- Oh. Do you know Willow Wilson?
- You mean... Hi?

18:10.556 --> 18:13.252
- Yes. Yes, that's her.
- Yeah, poor kid.

18:13.325 --> 18:16.783
Because she had to stay with that
boring, suburban straight family?

18:16.862 --> 18:19.387
No. She drives this
really ugly old car.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.365
Oh. Willow!

18:21.433 --> 18:22.593
Jill!

18:22.668 --> 18:26.968
Uh... thank you for the dance.
Here. Take her.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.865
I've been looking all over town for you.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.910
- Why?
- Because you didn't come home.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.978
And Dirk said you didn't meet him.

18:34.079 --> 18:37.606
Oh, yeah. Well, on the way I met some
people and we got to talking.

18:37.683 --> 18:41.175
And the next thing I knew,
I was bowling with drag queens.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.182
Willow, why didn't you call?

18:44.590 --> 18:47.320
I didn't know you liked to bowl.

18:48.927 --> 18:54.627
I'm not a phone person. You gotta find
change, and dial all those numbers...

18:55.734 --> 18:58.635
Do you act like this
when you're at Wilsors?

18:58.704 --> 19:02.572
- What's wrong with how I'm acting?
- You're not being considerate.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.610
You're not taking responsibility
for your actions.

19:05.677 --> 19:09.044
You're 26 years old, Willow.
It's time to grow up.

19:09.114 --> 19:12.379
Hey, lighten up.
You're not my mother.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.419
I know. I know.

19:14.486 --> 19:18.786
Look, I'm talking to you as your friend.

19:18.857 --> 19:23.351
Remember you said you wanted to move to
be around people who cared about you?

19:23.428 --> 19:25.487
Well, we care about you.

19:25.564 --> 19:31.400
So, if you disappear or don't check in,
that affects people.

19:31.470 --> 19:35.839
I'm sorry. I mean,
I know Uncle Wilsors a worrier.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.877
I didn't realize that you guys
would be worried, too.

19:38.944 --> 19:43.108
Wilson is like family to us.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.310
That makes you family.

19:46.385 --> 19:50.617
Wow. That means a lot to me.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.453
I mean, I've never really had a family.

19:53.559 --> 19:58.622
At least not one who cared
enough to go out looking for me.

19:59.164 --> 20:02.793
Well, you have that now.

20:02.868 --> 20:07.498
And that means you gotta learn
to pick up a phone, OK?

20:07.573 --> 20:09.507
- I will.
- All right.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.669
Thanks, Jill.
You're pretty cool.

20:12.744 --> 20:15.713
Well, at least cooler than Tim.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.378
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.178
- Not you.
- Oh.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.219
Him.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.317
Who's the loser now?

20:26.992 --> 20:30.758
"Who's the loser now?"

20:35.133 --> 20:39.661
- Well, hidy-ho, niece and neighborette.
- Hi!

20:39.738 --> 20:42.639
My bats are gone. And I see
my niece is still in one piece.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.575
- Everything went great.
- How was your trip?

20:45.644 --> 20:47.271
I was sick the entire time.

20:47.346 --> 20:50.782
I ate a piece of green cheese
thinking it was for St. Patrick's Day.

20:50.849 --> 20:53.613
Actually, it was just bad cheese.

20:53.685 --> 20:56.313
- Tim had some stomach trouble, too.
- Oh, really?

20:56.388 --> 21:01.951
It was my Moroccan cooking.
He must be squab-intolerant.

21:02.027 --> 21:05.190
Oh. And also, we went to this club
and he got rejected there.

21:05.297 --> 21:09.631
And he's been obsessed with
trying to get in there ever since.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.173
Hi, Wilson.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.834
What? What do you think?

21:17.943 --> 21:20.912
I think some nerve gas might've
leaked onto your side.

21:33.358 --> 21:34.723
What?

21:45.504 --> 21:47.335
Woo!

21:52.144 --> 21:53.577
- Dad?
- What?

21:53.645 --> 21:55.203
Take off your mask.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.338
Oh! What a rush!
