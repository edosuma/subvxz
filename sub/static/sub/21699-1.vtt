03:12.976 --> 03:14.200
Hello?

03:14.278 --> 03:17.903
Hi, baby, it's Casey.
I'm just calling to check up on you.

03:17.981 --> 03:20.072
How are you feeling?

03:20.850 --> 03:23.809
Um, I guess I'm feeling better
than a couple days ago,

03:23.887 --> 03:26.145
but I just... I don't think
it's ever something

03:26.223 --> 03:29.715
I'm gonna, you know, really get used to.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.884
Yeah, I know what you mean.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.753
I don't know how you do it.

03:33.831 --> 03:35.855
Eh, I just do it day by day.

03:35.933 --> 03:40.393
You know, if I did my job right,
it's a life saved versus a life lost.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.128
Hmm.

03:42.206 --> 03:45.631
Well, you're ready
for my birthday party tonight, right?

03:45.709 --> 03:46.966
Yep.

03:47.044 --> 03:49.001
Oh, hey, crap. I have to go.

03:49.079 --> 03:52.671
I'm running really late and I haven't
even started getting ready yet.

03:52.749 --> 03:56.008
Well, we know Marcus is just gonna love that.

03:56.086 --> 03:58.620
All right, I'll see you later.

04:27.951 --> 04:29.608
- Ha!
- Oh, my God, Marcus.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.845
I don't like it when you do that.
You scared me.

04:32.923 --> 04:35.080
Then why do you tell me
to be here at a certain time

04:35.158 --> 04:37.082
and you're not ready until hours later?

04:37.160 --> 04:39.261
- Okay, 10 minutes.
- Mmm.

04:40.564 --> 04:41.997
Ten minutes.

04:45.102 --> 04:47.092
The longer you take,

04:47.170 --> 04:49.271
the more I drink.

05:12.329 --> 05:14.019
Whose is this?

05:14.097 --> 05:16.064
Whose is what?

05:17.634 --> 05:19.591
The wallet.

05:19.669 --> 05:22.703
Oh. Um, I found it outside.
I was gonna try and return it.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.159
All done.

05:46.196 --> 05:48.287
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.665
All right.

05:54.805 --> 05:57.906
You know, I think I like the red dress
a little better on you.

05:59.977 --> 06:03.035
Okay, well, I think I can not die
from your disapproval.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.370
I... 

06:05.048 --> 06:06.982
You look great.

06:15.892 --> 06:18.059
You look great too.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.887
Can we please just go have fun tonight?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.255
Can we?

06:23.333 --> 06:24.924
Hmm?

06:25.002 --> 06:27.259
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

06:27.337 --> 06:28.561
Okay.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.597
<i># Big Daddy, show me why I wear the crown #</i>

06:31.675 --> 06:33.966
<i># I'll be good if you'll be nice #</i>

06:34.044 --> 06:35.568
Thank you.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.736
- Well, let's go.
- Okay, I just need to get one thing.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.905
- Whoa.
- <i># Swing #</i>

06:39.983 --> 06:42.007
Can I please just do
one thing really quickly?

06:42.085 --> 06:43.175
- Nope.
- Oh, babe.

06:43.253 --> 06:44.677
Nope.

06:45.255 --> 06:48.747
All right. Will you grab my jacket?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.849
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

06:50.927 --> 06:54.229
<i># Swing, swing, swing it on me #</i>

06:56.733 --> 06:59.892
Yeah, I definitely want to go to Vegas.

06:59.970 --> 07:03.662
My friend Alison, she just took off to Vegas.

07:03.740 --> 07:05.664
She didn't tell anybody.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.304
I wish I can be like that...

07:12.382 --> 07:14.373
so spontaneous,

07:14.451 --> 07:16.775
just going off a whim.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.044
It's exciting.

07:19.122 --> 07:20.746
There's something romantic about it.

07:20.824 --> 07:22.791
Don't you think?

07:29.833 --> 07:32.791
Man, I'm using my best... my best stuff here.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.409
It's so funny.

07:35.337 --> 07:37.972
- You are.
- I'm glad you think so.

07:39.009 --> 07:41.133
Is your girlfriend funny?

07:41.211 --> 07:43.068
I don't have a girlfriend.

07:43.146 --> 07:46.005
Not ever since I buried my wife.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.916
Mmm.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.646
No wonder you've been a bit distant.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.423
Is it that obvious?

07:57.928 --> 08:02.397
Um, well, I just... I have
a good sense about people.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.334
I'm really good at reading them.

08:09.473 --> 08:13.232
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:13.310 --> 08:16.811
But where would you
disappear to if you could?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.850
LA.

08:24.888 --> 08:27.046
You're... you're already here.

08:27.124 --> 08:28.890
Why LA?

08:31.194 --> 08:33.686
I like the pace of it.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.865
You know, everyone coming
and going, keeps it fresh.

08:37.967 --> 08:40.068
I like that.

08:41.538 --> 08:45.073
Well, who are you? Tell me more about you.

08:50.547 --> 08:52.771
I'm an open book.

08:52.849 --> 08:57.285
Well, I look forward to reading the pages.

09:05.328 --> 09:06.952
I'm feeling adventurous.

09:07.030 --> 09:09.722
Do you care to join me?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.924
Vegas?

09:12.002 --> 09:15.804
My place is a bit closer.

09:19.276 --> 09:20.899
- Hey.
- What?

09:20.977 --> 09:22.267
- Can you slow down?
- Come on.

09:22.345 --> 09:24.479
Come on. We gotta get going.

09:27.350 --> 09:30.409
All right, he's about one minute away, okay?

09:30.487 --> 09:32.044
What?

09:32.122 --> 09:34.847
- My Ryde car.
- Ryde car?

09:34.925 --> 09:37.149
Ryde. It's an app.

09:37.227 --> 09:41.086
It's like, um... a taxi,

09:41.164 --> 09:43.756
just more comfortable.

09:43.834 --> 09:47.059
- More comfortable?
- Yeah.

09:47.137 --> 09:50.896
In a "my friend is giving us
a ride" type of way.

09:50.974 --> 09:52.073
More comfort...

09:53.176 --> 09:54.509
Yeah.

09:57.113 --> 09:59.080
You've really never heard of it?

10:00.350 --> 10:03.084
Don't worry about it. He has five R's up.

10:06.256 --> 10:08.623
Meaning he's not going to kill us.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.633
- Karl?
- Stephanie?

10:21.438 --> 10:23.061
Hop in.

10:23.139 --> 10:24.429
Hello.

10:24.507 --> 10:27.099
You can just come in. Come on.

10:30.413 --> 10:32.204
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

10:32.282 --> 10:34.540
- How are you?
- Good.

10:34.618 --> 10:37.242
Uh, so, guys, I'm Karl.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.211
Help yourself to water and gum.

10:39.289 --> 10:42.247
Let me know if y'all want
the AC or radio adjusted.

10:42.325 --> 10:46.285
Uh, by the way,
I just dropped my new mix tape.

10:46.363 --> 10:49.555
"Thunder," $5.99, in case y'all want a copy.

10:49.633 --> 10:50.989
Thank you.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.468
I think we're good back here.

11:04.648 --> 11:07.406
You didn't even give him the address.

11:07.484 --> 11:09.842
I put it in the app.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.510
It's okay.

12:03.239 --> 12:07.332
Hey, guys, uh... looks like we're here.

12:07.410 --> 12:09.368
Oh, wow, that was fast.

12:09.446 --> 12:11.136
Thank you so much.

12:11.214 --> 12:15.474
Uh, if y'all enjoyed your ride tonight,

12:15.552 --> 12:17.309
here's my card.

12:17.387 --> 12:19.278
Thank you. Appreciate it.

12:19.356 --> 12:21.380
You can use my code to request me again.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.615
No matter where I'm at in Los Angeles,

12:23.693 --> 12:26.461
- I'll come to you.
- Thanks.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.396
- How much do I owe you?
- Are you coming?

12:37.474 --> 12:38.664
Oh, it's all good, bro.

12:38.742 --> 12:40.666
Everything's done through the app.

12:40.744 --> 12:42.367
No more need for cash.

12:42.445 --> 12:43.468
Tip?

12:43.546 --> 12:45.213
It's not necessary.

12:47.751 --> 12:49.617
Come on, really.

12:52.122 --> 12:53.654
Thanks, man.

13:28.124 --> 13:33.327
Well, why don't you pour us
a couple glasses of wine?

13:41.838 --> 13:44.172
Come find me.

14:45.835 --> 14:47.793
Are you coming?

14:47.871 --> 14:50.204
Yeah, I'll be right there.

15:21.204 --> 15:23.271
The water's perfect.

15:42.258 --> 15:44.325
Close your eyes.

15:46.729 --> 15:48.296
No peeking.

15:52.402 --> 15:54.468
Turn around.

17:35.638 --> 17:39.940
Hey, it's Karl, I got your request.
I'll be right there.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.804
Hey, long time.

18:19.882 --> 18:22.874
So where are we off to?
I didn't get an address.

18:22.952 --> 18:25.543
If you don't mind,
if I could just direct you?

18:25.621 --> 18:27.688
- No problem.
- Great.

18:36.132 --> 18:38.466
You having a good night so far?

18:39.936 --> 18:42.060
Actually,

18:42.138 --> 18:44.929
it's been a bit disappointing.

18:45.007 --> 18:47.999
But the night's still young.
I could turn it around.

18:48.077 --> 18:50.378
True.

18:59.822 --> 19:03.648
So what do you do, for work, I mean?

19:03.726 --> 19:05.417
I'm an EMT.

19:05.495 --> 19:07.419
How long have you been doing this?

19:07.497 --> 19:10.622
- This whole Ryde?
- It's been about a year,

19:10.700 --> 19:12.991
a year and a half now, give or take.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.626
That's a long time.

19:14.704 --> 19:17.872
We're gonna make a right at the stop sign.

19:20.676 --> 19:22.600
Pretty easy gig, huh? Driving people around.

19:22.678 --> 19:23.868
Definitely.

19:23.946 --> 19:26.113
I make my own sched.

19:29.185 --> 19:31.710
You don't have to check in with anyone?

19:31.788 --> 19:34.755
Nope. Just start the app and drive.

19:38.027 --> 19:40.385
Does anyone ever sit in the front seat?

19:40.463 --> 19:44.165
All right time, but it's whatever
you're comfortable with.

19:46.169 --> 19:49.994
You're not scared of a stranger
getting in the car with you?

19:50.072 --> 19:53.531
Haven't had any problems yet.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.534
So far, all my passengers
have been pretty harmless,

19:56.612 --> 19:59.046
unless vomit worries you.

20:03.886 --> 20:06.620
And make a right up here.

20:14.897 --> 20:17.655
A lot of nice-looking ladies too.

20:17.733 --> 20:20.558
That's a definite plus.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.670
You must clean up.

20:23.906 --> 20:26.207
Me? Uh...

20:28.010 --> 20:31.469
No, I'm not exactly what
you'd call a ladies' man.

20:31.547 --> 20:32.871
Girlfriend?

20:32.949 --> 20:34.782
Not anymore.

20:36.786 --> 20:38.676
Anymore?

20:38.754 --> 20:41.021
It was pretty bad.

20:43.259 --> 20:45.550
It's crazy how things don't work out.

20:45.628 --> 20:49.530
She gets home on my birthday
and basically calls it quits.

20:51.067 --> 20:54.502
Wasn't the birthday present
I was anticipating.

20:55.238 --> 20:57.638
Happy belated birthday.

20:59.075 --> 21:00.975
Thanks, man.

21:03.880 --> 21:08.082
Yeah, if you can just, um,
just pull up right over here.

21:14.156 --> 21:16.257
Yeah, right here is perfect.

21:27.570 --> 21:32.096
Well, it's been fun.

21:32.174 --> 21:34.732
Actually, if you don't mind
just waiting a little bit,

21:34.810 --> 21:37.836
I'm gonna run upstairs,
grab some things for the night,

21:37.914 --> 21:39.604
head back to my girl's place.

21:39.682 --> 21:42.216
Absolutely, man. Take your time.

21:43.152 --> 21:44.752
Thanks.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.339
Mind if I throw my bag in the trunk?

23:21.417 --> 23:23.017
Not at all.

23:42.738 --> 23:44.629
Take the scenic route.

23:44.707 --> 23:47.098
- I'll direct you.
- Definitely.

23:47.176 --> 23:51.011
Just, um... just go straight up all the way.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.827
You gotta tell me your secret.

24:09.765 --> 24:11.732
Being myself?

24:14.136 --> 24:16.704
That's not gonna work for me.

24:20.843 --> 24:23.735
So how's it going with the ladies? Any luck?

24:23.813 --> 24:26.780
Not yet, but the night's still young.

24:29.218 --> 24:33.945
Well, I figure after all these rides
are given, bound to find a decent girl.

24:34.023 --> 24:36.180
Here's hoping.

24:36.258 --> 24:38.983
Ah, just keep refining your game, man.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.386
A nice guy like you?

24:41.464 --> 24:43.888
You'll be just fine.

24:43.966 --> 24:45.199
Thanks.

24:51.107 --> 24:53.264
I need a smoke.

24:53.342 --> 24:55.976
Do you want me to pull over for a bit?

24:57.413 --> 24:59.780
Yeah, if you don't mind.

25:01.183 --> 25:04.518
Just, uh, right around
the bend here will be great.

25:19.168 --> 25:21.993
Care to join me?

25:22.071 --> 25:24.004
Why not?

25:41.357 --> 25:43.381
Cigarette?

25:43.459 --> 25:46.193
So much for trying to quit, right?

25:52.334 --> 25:54.935
My mom always complains.

25:56.939 --> 25:59.139
"These thing'll kill ya!"

26:04.013 --> 26:06.013
Well, killing's better than dying.

26:07.216 --> 26:09.082
What do you mean?

26:14.089 --> 26:17.381
Killing's diminishing something...

26:17.459 --> 26:20.060
to take the life away from it.

26:21.397 --> 26:23.530
You decide when to take it.

26:24.867 --> 26:29.403
You make the choice to see the ripples
of your decision that affect tomorrow.

26:32.441 --> 26:34.474
Dying...

26:36.011 --> 26:39.036
that's a whole different story.

26:39.114 --> 26:42.316
You can't anticipate what you can't control.

26:51.493 --> 26:53.227
That's deep, bro.

27:02.304 --> 27:04.438
It's so serene up here.

27:06.642 --> 27:09.333
That's why I like it.

27:09.411 --> 27:11.445
All the isolation.

27:19.321 --> 27:22.356
I can see my house from here.

27:33.969 --> 27:35.435
Shall we?

29:28.450 --> 29:30.374
Hey, you all right?

29:30.452 --> 29:31.709
Need a jump?

29:31.787 --> 29:36.013
No, I'm okay. Just... having a cigarette.

29:36.091 --> 29:37.581
Can't smoke anywhere around here.

29:37.659 --> 29:40.384
I hear ya.

29:40.462 --> 29:42.129
Okay.

29:43.098 --> 29:44.765
Have a good night.

30:21.303 --> 30:24.204
Hi, I'm Karl.

30:25.274 --> 30:27.607
Hi, I'm Karl.

30:28.811 --> 30:30.668
Hi.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.479
Karl.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.384
Hey.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.195
Hi, I'm Karl.

31:25.267 --> 31:27.291
Um, where to?

31:27.369 --> 31:29.593
I already put in the address.

31:29.671 --> 31:31.338
Right.

31:43.819 --> 31:46.811
Oh, this is good. Right over here, please.

31:46.889 --> 31:48.512
Thanks.

31:48.590 --> 31:49.789
Bye.

32:57.259 --> 33:00.527
- Hi, I'm Karl.
- Can you hurry, please?

33:02.731 --> 33:04.288
Yamashiro?

33:04.766 --> 33:07.625
Yes. For a much-needed nightcap.

33:07.703 --> 33:09.493
Hi, Stefon?

33:09.571 --> 33:12.730
Yeah, do you mind calling the DJ tomorrow

33:12.808 --> 33:14.732
to remind them about the catering event?

33:14.810 --> 33:18.602
Yeah, well, I still have to call
Charles about the catering

33:18.680 --> 33:20.905
and then pick up the centerpieces.

33:20.983 --> 33:23.774
Oh, yeah. You know, which reminds me,

33:23.852 --> 33:26.777
I have to call Cheryl and tell her
that her speech has been bumped.

33:26.855 --> 33:29.956
Oh, great. Yeah, okay.
Yeah, just do that. All right.

33:31.627 --> 33:34.794
Okay, great. Thank you. Bye.

33:38.934 --> 33:42.469
My staff just needs to get their heads
out of their own asses.

33:46.408 --> 33:47.865
Hello?

33:47.943 --> 33:51.502
Yes. Yeah, I already spoke to Stefon.

33:51.580 --> 33:54.205
Yeah, he's gonna call the DJ.
Don't even worry about it.

33:54.283 --> 33:55.706
Yeah, of course.

33:55.784 --> 33:59.777
Okay, yeah, so now that I have you
on the phone, can you please call Cheryl

33:59.855 --> 34:02.713
and tell her that she will
no longer be doing her speech?

34:02.791 --> 34:04.481
Yeah, I know.

34:04.559 --> 34:06.584
Yeah, I know how she is.

34:06.662 --> 34:10.387
Well, I would call her myself,
but I just don't want to.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.290
Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay, great. So just do it.

34:13.368 --> 34:15.292
That's why I'm asking you.

34:15.370 --> 34:17.603
Okay. Okay, thank you.

34:24.780 --> 34:27.681
Oh, you missed the turn.

34:30.052 --> 34:34.511
Excuse me, you missed the turn.

34:34.589 --> 34:37.781
I can't believe this.
I'm already running behind.

34:37.859 --> 34:40.493
You can just make the U-turn up here.

34:43.465 --> 34:44.420
Pull over!

34:44.498 --> 34:46.322
Pull over, now!

34:46.400 --> 34:49.768
Look, I just ended the...
I just ended the ride.

34:52.541 --> 34:54.873
Can you just please stop the car?

34:55.976 --> 34:57.968
What do you want? You want money?

34:58.046 --> 35:00.304
What? You want some money?
Here, just take it.

35:00.382 --> 35:02.439
Come on, please, just pull over the car.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.408
I won't tell anybody.

35:04.486 --> 35:06.343
I won't tell anybody!

35:06.421 --> 35:08.655
Just please open... Let me out.

35:09.591 --> 35:12.349
Oh, please, just let me out!

35:16.365 --> 35:17.630
No...

37:48.783 --> 37:49.940
Hi.

37:50.018 --> 37:53.210
- Hi. Karl.
- Hi, Karl.

37:53.288 --> 37:55.546
Um, we're going to go to the Blue Kat Lounge.

37:55.624 --> 37:57.080
Do you know where that is?

37:57.158 --> 37:59.049
Do you have the address?

37:59.127 --> 38:01.752
He's got it.

38:01.830 --> 38:04.030
You got it, right?

38:06.101 --> 38:08.701
Yeah, see, he's got it.

38:14.109 --> 38:16.500
Hey, bro, hey, can you roll
this window up right here, man?

38:16.578 --> 38:19.002
You're totally fucking up my hair.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.281
Pump some AC back here, all right?

38:23.752 --> 38:26.643
Love, did you drive to me?

38:26.721 --> 38:28.045
Yes.

38:29.073 --> 38:30.973
Don't start with me.

38:38.633 --> 38:39.732
Busy night?

38:41.970 --> 38:43.861
Yeah. How about you?

38:43.939 --> 38:45.796
Oh, we have a friend's birthday.

38:45.874 --> 38:47.865
We're going to stop in for a drink

38:47.943 --> 38:50.801
and then it's his turn.

38:51.479 --> 38:53.070
His turn?

38:53.148 --> 38:55.272
You like Jason's parties too.

38:55.350 --> 38:57.140
Okay.

38:57.218 --> 39:00.511
But Casey's my friend and it's her birthday,

39:00.589 --> 39:02.646
so I would just like
to stay for a little while.

39:02.724 --> 39:06.717
All right, J. But we can't stay all night,
or else we won't make it to Jason's.

39:06.795 --> 39:08.619
No, it's fine, but it's her birthday.

39:08.697 --> 39:10.621
I don't want to be rude.
I don't want to be rushed.

39:10.699 --> 39:11.822
All right.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.924
Okay, we'll leave by 11:00.

39:14.002 --> 39:15.768
How's that sound?

39:35.957 --> 39:37.323
Eleven?

39:40.161 --> 39:41.828
Yeah.

39:54.376 --> 39:56.233
Thank you very much.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.177
Have a good night, okay?

40:01.149 --> 40:03.173
- Yo J, 11:00.
- I'm coming.

40:03.251 --> 40:05.318
Let's go.

40:12.227 --> 40:15.052
Hey, guy.

40:15.130 --> 40:17.588
Hey, I don't want to be here all night.

40:17.666 --> 40:18.989
- Okay, I know.
- Okay?

40:19.067 --> 40:21.258
Yeah. But we just got here, so...

40:21.336 --> 40:23.327
I just want to make... you know.

40:23.405 --> 40:25.295
I just don't want to be here all night.

40:25.373 --> 40:26.964
- Okay.
- All right, this guy.

40:27.042 --> 40:28.665
Come on.

40:28.743 --> 40:32.202
Hey, I'm gonna go fix
my hair 'cause of the...

40:32.280 --> 40:34.237
Order me a Guinness, all right?

40:34.315 --> 40:35.782
Okay.

40:37.452 --> 40:39.009
Hey, what can I get you?

40:39.087 --> 40:42.012
Can I get a water and lime and a Guinness?

40:42.090 --> 40:43.680
We're actually out of Guinness.

40:43.758 --> 40:46.826
Just the water is fine for now, thank you.

40:50.298 --> 40:54.658
- You're here!
- Oh, yay, happy birthday!

40:54.736 --> 40:57.260
Oh, my God!

40:57.338 --> 40:59.863
Please tell me you left Marcus at home.

40:59.941 --> 41:01.898
Cas... come on, no. He's in the bathroom.

41:01.976 --> 41:03.667
Ugh. How's that going?

41:03.745 --> 41:07.938
Uh, it's not good, but it doesn't
matter because we're here.

41:08.016 --> 41:10.173
And this is my awesome friend
and it's her birthday,

41:10.251 --> 41:12.609
so who's going to buy her
a round of shots tonight?

41:12.687 --> 41:14.111
 Okay.

41:14.189 --> 41:17.014
You're going to be well taken care of
tonight. And this is the best.

41:17.092 --> 41:18.715
Yeah, that's all she needs...

41:18.793 --> 41:20.650
- more shots.
- Oh.

41:20.728 --> 41:21.818
Casey.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.153
Happy birthday.

41:23.231 --> 41:25.255
Thanks, Marcus.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.290
All right. Yeah.

41:27.368 --> 41:29.726
- Hey, where's my drink?
- Oh, they were out.

41:29.804 --> 41:31.862
- Out of Guinness?
- Yeah.

41:31.940 --> 41:33.930
That's not strange to you?

41:34.008 --> 41:36.133
You didn't think to order me something else?

41:36.211 --> 41:39.454
- I didn't know what else you would want.
- You didn't know what I would want?

41:43.118 --> 41:44.941
Yo, Jase?

41:45.019 --> 41:47.944
Yeah, I'm still here.

41:48.022 --> 41:50.247
Yeah. Cool. What?

41:50.325 --> 41:52.916
Oh, playa! Whoo!

42:30.064 --> 42:32.565
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

42:34.169 --> 42:35.968
Hey, what up, man?

42:39.207 --> 42:42.399
Um, did Simiko call you a Ryde?

42:42.477 --> 42:45.435
Nah, man, but she'll find another ride.

42:45.513 --> 42:49.348
Besides, I got cash, so let's go.

42:53.321 --> 42:54.845
Terrance.

42:54.923 --> 42:58.991
My friends, they like to call me Double T!

43:00.461 --> 43:02.252
So we're friends?

43:02.330 --> 43:05.865
Oh, hell yeah, man.
Double T's everybody's friend.

43:09.337 --> 43:10.794
All right.

43:10.872 --> 43:12.195
Where to?

43:12.273 --> 43:13.964
We're just going to Brentwood.

43:14.042 --> 43:17.009
Head up Wilshire. I'll direct you.

43:19.146 --> 43:20.370
<i># Yeah, yeah #</i>

43:20.448 --> 43:23.006
<i># I'm gettin' dough, I'm gettin' guap #</i>

43:23.084 --> 43:25.342
<i># I throw it up and let it drop #</i>

43:25.420 --> 43:27.978
<i># I said I'm gettin' dough,
I'm gettin' guap #</i>

43:28.056 --> 43:30.480
<i># I throw it up... #</i>

43:30.558 --> 43:33.049
- <i># 'Cause I got money... #</i>
- You can answer that.

43:33.127 --> 43:35.085
- <i># 'Cause I got money... #</i>
- Double T knows, man.

43:35.163 --> 43:37.554
He just likes this motherfuckin' song.

43:37.632 --> 43:41.825
<i># 'Cause I got it, I got it,
bitch, you don't... #</i>

43:41.903 --> 43:43.326
Hey, yo, Willis, where you at?

43:43.404 --> 43:46.563
Yo, man, I'm on my way,
soon as I finish up with these honeys.

43:46.641 --> 43:48.932
- You know how it is.
- Aww!

43:49.010 --> 43:50.901
Hell, yeah, motherfucker.

43:50.979 --> 43:53.236
What's up? Where you at?

43:53.314 --> 43:54.971
I'm just in a Ryde.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.183
You got a chick driver?

43:58.119 --> 43:59.442
- Nah, man.
- Aw, man.

43:59.520 --> 44:01.144
I'm just ridin' with Karl.

44:01.222 --> 44:03.547
Yo, say "what up," Karl.

44:03.625 --> 44:04.915
Yeah.

44:04.993 --> 44:06.917
Two-timers.

44:06.995 --> 44:09.586
Yeah, anyway, man. Yo, you grab your girl

44:09.664 --> 44:13.356
and some Tinder hotties
and you head up to the club, all right?

44:13.434 --> 44:14.891
Yeah, I got you.

44:14.969 --> 44:18.295
- Double T does not fly solo.
- I got you.

44:18.373 --> 44:20.330
- I'll see you there.
- <i># I'm gettin' dough #</i>

44:20.408 --> 44:21.898
<i># I'm gettin' guap #</i>

44:21.976 --> 44:24.000
<i># I throw it up and let it drop #</i>

44:24.078 --> 44:26.436
<i># I say, I'm gettin' dough,
I'm gettin' guap... #</i>

44:26.514 --> 44:28.505
Double T, you should put your seat belt on.

44:28.583 --> 44:30.106
What?

44:30.184 --> 44:32.209
You should put your seat belt on.

44:32.287 --> 44:33.443
What?

44:33.521 --> 44:36.012
Your seat belt, you should put it on.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.181
Oh, no, man, I'm good.

44:40.295 --> 44:43.220
- Oh, fuck.
- Shoot, man.

44:43.298 --> 44:46.523
I'm... Are you okay? I have a first-aid kit

44:46.601 --> 44:49.292
in the back of the trunk. I'll pull over.

44:49.370 --> 44:50.360
Oh!

45:22.270 --> 45:25.137
Hey, Karl, I'm gonna need that bag.

45:26.341 --> 45:28.040
Thanks, buddy.

45:35.450 --> 45:37.307
Hey, would you mind stepping out

45:37.385 --> 45:40.577
so I can clean you up without
getting a mess on the car?

45:40.655 --> 45:43.079
Oh, yeah, man. Double T's hurting pretty bad,

45:43.157 --> 45:45.758
but he does not want to mess up your ride.

45:47.628 --> 45:50.654
Right, just go ahead and tilt your head back.

46:49.323 --> 46:52.182
Jasmine? What's going on?

46:52.260 --> 46:54.551
I don't understand why you're so upset.

46:54.629 --> 46:57.554
You made me come to this dump.

46:57.632 --> 46:59.322
You had a good time.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.424
Me hanging out with your friends...

47:01.502 --> 47:04.060
your slutty friends...
it's not a good time for me.

47:04.138 --> 47:05.695
I did not disrespect your friend.

47:05.773 --> 47:08.231
Don't disrespect mine.

47:08.309 --> 47:09.666
Okay.

47:09.744 --> 47:11.267
Okay.

47:11.345 --> 47:13.269
All right, well, all my friends are dope.

47:13.347 --> 47:15.347
What do you want me to say?

47:23.491 --> 47:27.126
- Hi, just one hot dog.
- One hot dog? Okay.

47:28.262 --> 47:30.420
Hi, there. Uno, por favor.

47:30.498 --> 47:31.521
Menu?

47:31.599 --> 47:33.556
Can I just do a hot dog?

47:33.634 --> 47:35.625
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you want everything?

47:35.703 --> 47:36.726
SÃ­.

47:36.804 --> 47:38.528
- Okay.
- Thank you.

47:38.606 --> 47:41.064
Oh, no, no, no, no. It's okay.

47:41.142 --> 47:43.466
Ah, here. Thank you.

47:43.544 --> 47:45.244
Thank you, though.

47:48.816 --> 47:51.474
Do I know you?

47:51.552 --> 47:54.253
You're that Ryde driver.

47:56.124 --> 47:58.581
- Blue Kat Lounge.
- Yeah, that's right.

47:58.659 --> 48:01.351
Okay, been thinking about it.

48:01.429 --> 48:03.686
You're right. If you don't want to go,
you don't have to.

48:03.764 --> 48:05.731
But I want you to go.

48:08.436 --> 48:09.759
- Come here.
- No, don't touch me.

48:09.837 --> 48:11.637
- Okay, fine.
- Don't.

48:13.808 --> 48:16.609
That's embarrassing.

48:18.179 --> 48:20.270
- You okay?
- Yeah.

48:20.348 --> 48:22.515
Just a little embarrassed.

48:25.586 --> 48:27.353
I'm still on the clock.

48:29.891 --> 48:32.291
I can find myself better.

48:39.800 --> 48:41.267
All right.

48:51.479 --> 48:53.913
No, no, no, don't worry about it. I'm good.

48:57.485 --> 48:59.642
Hey, I'm coming with you.

48:59.720 --> 49:02.354
- Marcus...
- I'm coming with you.

49:12.900 --> 49:16.802
Hey, pal, 4233 Vine Street.

49:22.677 --> 49:24.967
Hey, can you turn on the radio?

49:25.645 --> 49:27.313
Thanks.

49:36.490 --> 49:38.357
J?

49:39.860 --> 49:42.394
J, I don't want to keep doing this.

49:46.901 --> 49:49.702
So you're just not going to talk to me?

50:01.983 --> 50:04.883
This isn't going to work if you resent me.

50:06.554 --> 50:08.211
What do you want me to do?

50:08.289 --> 50:10.322
This is hard for me.

50:11.392 --> 50:13.483
- For you?
- Yes.

50:13.561 --> 50:16.352
No, this... this is my burden.

50:16.430 --> 50:20.423
Oh, just you?

50:20.501 --> 50:22.759
Not me?

50:22.837 --> 50:25.938
Like... like I don't want a family too?

50:28.809 --> 50:31.568
You know, Jasmine, sometimes,

50:31.646 --> 50:34.304
you can be a real self-centered bitch.

50:35.382 --> 50:36.839
What the fuck, man?

50:36.917 --> 50:38.784
What's your problem?

50:43.958 --> 50:46.282
What the hell, dude?

50:46.360 --> 50:48.894
Hey. Hey, get off me, man.

51:05.446 --> 51:06.703
Hey.

51:08.549 --> 51:10.407
Hey, buddy.

51:10.485 --> 51:12.642
Buddy? Yeah, we're here.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.720
Can you unlock the door?

51:16.023 --> 51:17.956
Thanks.

51:22.096 --> 51:26.789
Please, um... call me direct.

51:26.867 --> 51:29.826
Issues with the promo,
you know, if you need a ride.

51:29.904 --> 51:31.870
Okay, thanks.

51:33.374 --> 51:36.075
- Let's go, J.
- All right, I'm coming.

51:56.831 --> 52:02.134
<i># Follow me and get no peace #</i>

52:04.071 --> 52:07.530
<i># And I'll say don't you stray #</i>

52:07.608 --> 52:11.143
<i># Too close to me #</i>

52:12.913 --> 52:14.604
<i># This dark side #</i>

52:14.682 --> 52:19.651
<i># Careful 'round me as you breathe #</i>

52:23.624 --> 52:28.527
<i># Follow me and get no peace #</i>

52:32.066 --> 52:34.800
<i># I warned #</i>

52:36.604 --> 52:39.529
<i># And you swore #</i>

52:39.607 --> 52:43.433
<i># You could handle #</i>

52:43.511 --> 52:46.111
<i># My crazy #</i>

52:57.591 --> 53:00.016
<i># Stay where you stand #</i>

53:00.094 --> 53:03.595
<i># Don't come nearer #</i>

53:05.099 --> 53:08.801
<i># You search for home #</i>

53:09.837 --> 53:12.962
<i># Just get stone cold #</i>

53:42.236 --> 53:43.793
Hi, Officer. How may I help you?

53:43.871 --> 53:45.595
I'm Officer Puente.

53:45.673 --> 53:49.866
I'm gonna need to see
your license and registration.

53:49.944 --> 53:52.068
May I ask what this is pertaining to?

53:52.146 --> 53:53.803
You're about to get a ticket.

53:53.881 --> 53:55.505
You're parked in the red zone.

53:55.583 --> 53:56.973
You're not allowed to park here,

53:57.051 --> 53:58.674
- even if it's in idle.
- Ah.

53:58.752 --> 54:00.743
I'm so sorry, sir.

54:00.821 --> 54:02.512
I didn't even realize that.

54:02.590 --> 54:04.180
I can just pull up a few feet,
get out of the red?

54:04.258 --> 54:06.258
License and registration.

54:09.129 --> 54:12.088
See, there they are there.
Those are my passengers.

54:12.166 --> 54:14.690
Oh, you're a Ryde driver?

54:14.768 --> 54:16.692
Yes, sir.

54:16.770 --> 54:19.162
- How you doin'?
- Thank you.

54:19.240 --> 54:22.198
Don't give our friend here a ticket.

54:22.276 --> 54:25.001
I mean, it was our fault. We made him wait.

54:25.079 --> 54:27.703
Yeah, Officer.
We were just helping our friend.

54:27.781 --> 54:28.881
I'll try not to.

54:30.050 --> 54:32.108
All right, now, you guys gonna be okay?

54:32.186 --> 54:35.654
I think so. We're in good hands.

54:37.525 --> 54:39.115
- So, where we going?
- Okay.

54:39.193 --> 54:41.517
So I'm gonna let you off
with a warning this time.

54:41.595 --> 54:42.919
Thank you, Officer.

54:42.997 --> 54:45.521
Just make sure they get home safely, okay?

54:45.599 --> 54:46.756
Absolutely, sir.

54:46.834 --> 54:48.100
Have a good night.

54:52.740 --> 54:55.198
Can you put that away, please? Thank you.

54:59.146 --> 55:02.981
Okay, she's... she's
the one doing it. She's like...

55:05.019 --> 55:07.143
Can you step out of the car for a second?

55:07.221 --> 55:08.478
Yes, Officer.

55:08.556 --> 55:10.055
Uh...

55:19.967 --> 55:21.824
What seems to be the problem, Officer?

55:21.902 --> 55:23.025
Your light's flickering.

55:23.103 --> 55:25.862
Oh, yeah, that. It... it happens.

55:25.940 --> 55:28.030
Well, pop the trunk.

55:28.108 --> 55:29.999
It's usually a faulty connection.

55:30.077 --> 55:32.068
I see it all the time. It's just loose.

55:32.146 --> 55:34.046
But I can fix it.

55:35.683 --> 55:37.507
Normally fixes on its own.

55:37.585 --> 55:39.609
Oh, just pop the trunk anyway.

55:39.687 --> 55:42.512
You don't want to get pulled over
twice in the same night, right?

55:42.590 --> 55:45.724
Come on, so these girls can get home safely.

55:46.827 --> 55:48.894
It'll just take a second.

56:01.909 --> 56:04.667
Hey! It stopped flickering.

56:04.745 --> 56:06.903
- I guess you were right.
- Told ya.

56:06.981 --> 56:08.271
Happens all the time.

56:08.349 --> 56:09.872
I'll fix it out ASAP.

56:09.950 --> 56:11.783
Make sure you do.

56:13.153 --> 56:16.129
- She gonna be okay?
- Oh, she's fine.

56:16.209 --> 56:19.849
I mean, although, you may want
to hang her head out the window.

56:22.630 --> 56:24.620
Mmm, so soft.

56:24.698 --> 56:26.622
You girls have fun tonight?

56:26.700 --> 56:29.659
- You were amazing back there.
- Yeah.

56:29.737 --> 56:32.061
Like, so hot.

56:32.139 --> 56:34.931
- Stop it.
- I'm sorry, Karl.

56:35.009 --> 56:37.099
She's had a little bit too much vodka.

56:37.177 --> 56:39.569
Oh, so much vodka.

56:39.647 --> 56:41.671
- Yeah, baby.
- Whoo.

56:41.749 --> 56:43.673
Do you mind making an extra stop?

56:43.751 --> 56:45.107
It's on the way.

56:45.185 --> 56:46.976
Sure. What's the address?

56:47.054 --> 56:49.321
Oh, I'll just tell you where to go.

56:54.328 --> 56:56.852
Dude, like, you have to tell him.

56:56.930 --> 56:58.754
Oh, my God, you're right.

56:58.832 --> 57:01.366
Just head up 6th and then
I'll tell you where to turn.

57:06.273 --> 57:09.732
So, Karl, where are you from?

57:09.810 --> 57:11.968
You're so handsome.

57:12.046 --> 57:14.270
Kind of reminds me of my ex.

57:14.348 --> 57:17.206
Everyone, like, reminds you of your ex.

57:17.284 --> 57:21.310
- Yeah, well, he was hot.
- Who is this guy?

57:21.388 --> 57:25.181
Oh, shit, you should've turned back there.

57:25.259 --> 57:28.093
I mean, it's okay. It's not my credit card.

57:29.063 --> 57:30.386
It's okay.

57:30.464 --> 57:32.388
Just turn right here and then it's straight.

57:32.466 --> 57:33.999
I promise.

58:21.081 --> 58:23.339
So is your friend coming?

58:24.017 --> 58:26.709
Oh, my friend's right here.

58:26.787 --> 58:29.254
- He never lets me down.
- No, he doesn't.

59:09.496 --> 59:11.420
You know, if you wanted to end your night,

59:11.498 --> 59:13.789
you could come to this amazing party with us.

59:13.867 --> 59:15.458
- No.
- Oh, my gosh, yes.

59:15.536 --> 59:16.992
How fun!

59:17.070 --> 59:18.837
Not you, silly.

59:20.974 --> 59:23.032
You guys should probably settle down.

59:23.110 --> 59:25.000
Um, that's not gonna happen anytime soon...

59:25.078 --> 59:26.869
Yeah, don't be lame, Karl.

59:26.947 --> 59:28.804
Yeah, you know you want some.

59:28.882 --> 59:30.806
Yeah, join us.

59:30.884 --> 59:32.942
Yeah, let's go for a dip.

59:44.498 --> 59:47.265
Home sweet home.

59:51.137 --> 59:54.463
- Meet us in the pool!
- Yeah, don't take too long.

59:57.845 --> 59:59.911
He's so hot.

01:04:14.701 --> 01:04:17.836
Mmm. Brooke, you're the best.

01:06:42.315 --> 01:06:43.915
Hi, Jasmine.

01:06:45.285 --> 01:06:46.651
Hi, Karl.

01:06:48.388 --> 01:06:50.312
Just you?

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:52.390
Yes.

01:06:53.627 --> 01:06:55.717
All right. Where to?

01:06:55.795 --> 01:06:58.654
Um, it's 211 East 14th Street.

01:06:58.732 --> 01:06:59.888
It's in Long Beach.

01:06:59.966 --> 01:07:02.591
Sorry, it's kinda far.

01:07:02.669 --> 01:07:06.504
It's okay. I am at your disposal.

01:07:29.929 --> 01:07:31.629
Hi, Casey.

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:37.492
Yeah, I'm on my way home now. I'm in a Ryde.

01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:40.538
I hope you had a better night than I did.

01:07:44.044 --> 01:07:46.935
It's just Marcus.

01:07:47.013 --> 01:07:49.871
I don't know, he was just
being a jerk all night,

01:07:49.949 --> 01:07:51.974
ever since he got there.

01:07:52.052 --> 01:07:54.952
I just asked him for a couple of hours.

01:07:57.757 --> 01:08:01.993
God, it was just bad.
It was just all-around bad.

01:08:05.932 --> 01:08:08.790
Well, I can't wait to hear all
about it, all right?

01:08:08.868 --> 01:08:10.892
I'll hear about it when I get in.

01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:13.829
I'm just gonna stop in
and pick up a few things.

01:08:13.907 --> 01:08:15.606
Okay.

01:08:16.943 --> 01:08:19.444
Okay. All right, bye.

01:08:27.386 --> 01:08:29.386
Long night?

01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:34.716
- I'm sorry, what?
- Long night?

01:08:34.794 --> 01:08:36.852
I didn't mean to overhear.
It's just kind of hard not to.

01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:41.122
It's okay. I'm sure you guys
hear all kinds of crazy things.

01:08:42.135 --> 01:08:43.868
Kind of like being a therapist.

01:08:44.804 --> 01:08:46.671
But cheaper.

01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:50.732
Listen, I know it's not
a leather couch or anything,

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.910
but if you want to open up...

01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:58.840
No, thank you.

01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:00.685
I'm good.

01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:23.441
He didn't seem to really care about you.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:28.011
Excuse me?

01:09:31.984 --> 01:09:34.443
No, it's just not that simple.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.479
Sometimes it is.

01:09:37.557 --> 01:09:40.758
Sorry, I don't mean to pry,
I just see it all the time.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.468
- He was just...
- Being a jerk?

01:09:57.644 --> 01:10:01.570
Look, you seem like a really nice guy,

01:10:01.648 --> 01:10:04.139
but you're a bystander.

01:10:04.217 --> 01:10:06.675
So you really don't know
what you're talking about.

01:10:06.753 --> 01:10:08.977
Bystander?

01:10:09.055 --> 01:10:12.457
Doesn't it make more sense
to hear my non-biased opinion?

01:10:16.563 --> 01:10:19.121
You just seem like someone
that has a lot to offer,

01:10:19.199 --> 01:10:21.933
besides your obvious beauty.

01:10:25.905 --> 01:10:29.173
Thank you. That's... that's
very nice of you to say.

01:10:41.187 --> 01:10:43.111
Everything okay?

01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:45.447
Actually, you know what?

01:10:45.525 --> 01:10:47.682
I think, um, I think I left
something back at the party.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.994
Would you mind turning around, please?

01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:52.988
What did you leave?

01:10:53.066 --> 01:10:55.824
I, uh...

01:10:55.902 --> 01:10:57.926
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:59.995
Can you please pull over the car?

01:11:00.073 --> 01:11:02.206
Can you please pull the car over?

01:11:27.066 --> 01:11:29.024
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:29.102 --> 01:11:31.960
Oh, God.

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:34.696
Oh, God, I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

01:11:34.774 --> 01:11:36.307
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.971
What are you doing?

01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:46.817
- Hmm? I just...
- God, get off of me!

01:11:55.028 --> 01:11:56.245
No!

01:16:45.251 --> 01:16:47.808
It's okay, it's okay.

01:16:47.886 --> 01:16:51.555
It's okay. I'm gonna go get the nurse, okay?

01:16:52.959 --> 01:16:54.058
Okay.

01:17:02.635 --> 01:17:05.794
Calm down. Just lay back. Just lay back.

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:09.164
You went through quite an ordeal.

01:17:09.242 --> 01:17:10.641
Just relax.

01:17:13.412 --> 01:17:15.170
What happened?

01:17:15.248 --> 01:17:17.438
Baby, you were in an accident.

01:17:17.516 --> 01:17:19.340
You were in an accident, but you're okay.

01:17:19.418 --> 01:17:21.142
You're okay.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.020
Look here.

01:17:25.157 --> 01:17:29.994
You and your baby are going to be
just fine, but you have to take it easy.

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:33.922
Sorry. Excuse me?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.466
Did you say baby?

01:17:39.305 --> 01:17:41.162
Yup, baby.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.363
Oh, my God.

01:17:42.441 --> 01:17:44.232
- Surprise.
- What?

01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:47.101
J? Did you know?

01:17:47.179 --> 01:17:50.905
Baby? Baby, you're pregnant.

01:17:50.983 --> 01:17:54.242
Baby, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, baby.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.877
- No.
- I'm hoping you forgive me.

01:17:55.955 --> 01:17:57.612
Please. Please forgive me.

01:17:57.690 --> 01:17:59.347
I love you so much.

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.282
I love you so much.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.451
I love you so much.

01:18:03.529 --> 01:18:05.587
I'm sorry, baby.

01:18:05.665 --> 01:18:08.032
It's gonna be our family, okay?

01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:13.528
But you have a visitor.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:15.706
And I don't think it can wait.

01:18:20.947 --> 01:18:23.238
Miss Jasmine Baker?

01:18:23.316 --> 01:18:25.206
Yes, that's me.

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:27.041
I'm Detective Ramirez.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:29.110
I know this is a delicate time,

01:18:29.188 --> 01:18:32.256
but we need you to come down
and identify the driver's body.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.083
Right now?

01:18:35.161 --> 01:18:37.027
Yes.

01:18:40.166 --> 01:18:42.132
Jazzy, I'll go with you.

01:18:46.038 --> 01:18:50.007
Hey, if you don't mind, I'll take her.

01:19:03.289 --> 01:19:05.914
Just breathe. You're okay.

01:19:05.992 --> 01:19:07.615
- Yeah.
- You ready?

01:19:07.693 --> 01:19:09.193
Yeah.

01:19:14.133 --> 01:19:15.632
Please.

01:19:19.138 --> 01:19:21.129
Oh, my God.

01:19:21.207 --> 01:19:23.197
Oh, no, no, no, I can't. I can't.

01:19:23.275 --> 01:19:26.034
It's all right. Just breathe, okay?

01:19:26.112 --> 01:19:29.137
It's all right, all right.

01:19:29.215 --> 01:19:31.205
Take your time.

01:19:31.283 --> 01:19:32.683
Just take your time.

01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:45.586
That's not... that's not the driver.

01:19:45.664 --> 01:19:47.655
I'm sorry, that's not the driver.

01:19:47.733 --> 01:19:50.158
Baby, no more.

01:19:50.236 --> 01:19:52.160
Karl Shafer?

01:19:52.238 --> 01:19:55.029
This is the guy we pulled out
of the front seat of the car.

01:19:55.107 --> 01:19:56.731
No, that's not him.

01:19:56.809 --> 01:20:00.034
I mean, it kind of looks like him,
I guess, a little bit.

01:20:00.112 --> 01:20:01.569
- You sure? You sure?
- I don't...

01:20:01.647 --> 01:20:03.104
Wait, wait, wait.

01:20:03.182 --> 01:20:05.239
You hit your head pretty hard before.

01:20:05.317 --> 01:20:07.041
Take your time.

01:20:07.119 --> 01:20:08.752
Take another look.

01:20:34.647 --> 01:20:37.405
This guy might be Karl.

01:20:37.483 --> 01:20:40.250
But it's not him.

01:20:42.288 --> 01:20:44.112
It's the wrong guy.

01:21:27.833 --> 01:21:29.366
