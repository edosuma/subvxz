01:57.851 --> 02:00.081
His name is Martin McGartland...

02:00.186 --> 02:03.781
and when I met him, he was an unemployed
Catholic hood selling stolen goods.

02:09.729 --> 02:13.290
Now, these are a guarantee for action,
all for a couple of quid, like?

02:13.666 --> 02:15.827
-T ake yourself off.
-well, would you have a dollar?

02:17.203 --> 02:19.330
See, now, I had you down for
something a wee bit silky...

02:19.405 --> 02:21.236
-Oh, not again.
-Oh, come on, it's sexy...

02:22.876 --> 02:26.903
Martin helped support his family.
I liked that about him.

02:33.052 --> 02:35.213
-we don't want any!
-wait, don't go!

02:36.489 --> 02:37.683
Have any Hugo Boss?

02:40.326 --> 02:42.886
-Only the entire line at my fingertips.
-All right.

02:52.805 --> 02:54.500
No, there's no way, man.
No way.

02:56.442 --> 02:57.238
Please?

02:58.077 --> 03:00.477
Okay, I'll do you nine
if you take the Hugo Boss for 10.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.178
Done. Do you want
to have a look, Lara?

03:03.683 --> 03:04.741
You know I'm not.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.154
Oh, thank God there's you and
the Pope looking after our souls.

03:08.788 --> 03:11.655
You seem to be under the wrong impression.
These goods are not stolen.

03:11.724 --> 03:14.249
They're... manufacturer overruns.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.992
How about some shoes, Mrs. Flaherty?
Like, I've got loads of shoes.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.100
I can get you any shoes you like.
Anything from this catalogue here.

03:22.735 --> 03:24.362
There's no point in me looking, love.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.534
Not that I care where it comes from.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.606
well, maybe next month.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.272
Okay, well...

03:36.216 --> 03:38.707
-Here, Mummy, can I have another tenner?
-No, you cannot.

03:38.818 --> 03:39.807
Oh, please?

03:39.852 --> 03:42.582
what did you do with that 20
I last gave you? what did you do?

03:42.689 --> 03:44.088
I don't know.
It just adds up.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.316
So if there's anything you need...

03:45.391 --> 03:49.225
Jobs were generally controlled by
the Protestants, which meant...

03:49.295 --> 03:54.130
most of the young Catholic men were
unemployed, and angry about it.

03:55.668 --> 03:58.728
Martin and Sean have lived
on the edge for so long...

03:58.771 --> 04:00.102
they didn't know any other way.

04:01.307 --> 04:05.334
No way, man.
who'd you kill for this, you wanker?

04:06.879 --> 04:10.406
1 800, twin cam,
and up to 60 in seven seconds.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.940
Outrun any peeler in the city.

04:13.319 --> 04:17.153
The boot's a wee bit small, but it'll do.
I can get you a deal anytime.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.317
It's no use.
I can't afford the petrol.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.224
And that's where I come in.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.923
I was a peeler. That's what
they call the police in Belfast.

04:25.999 --> 04:31.027
I was a Handler with the Special Branch.
My codename was Fergus.

04:39.012 --> 04:43.506
You see, by 1 988, Belfast had been
a battleground for 20 years.

04:45.084 --> 04:48.884
The Irish Republican Army against
Unionist Ulster Defense Force.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.548
Both were illegal armies.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.416
It was about freedom.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.459
Police barricaded all
roads leading to...

04:55.928 --> 04:59.887
Unionists want Northern Ireland
to stay as part of the United Kingdom.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.263
Catholic Republicans want
free of British rule.

05:02.302 --> 05:06.432
Both sides were willing to kill
for their cause.

05:08.641 --> 05:13.772
By 1 969, violence was so bad British
troops were sent to keep the peace.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.439
They've been there ever since.

05:16.916 --> 05:20.613
To the IRA, they were also
an occupying army.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.020
B-20. we have a report
of sniper fire.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.714
-Thanks, love.
- Two officers down.

05:24.757 --> 05:27.419
Send available blue lights
to Falls Road area.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.518
This is B-20, out.

05:32.598 --> 05:33.656
Is everybody all right?

05:36.502 --> 05:39.062
-Outcome?
-Result.

05:39.439 --> 05:42.670
Six shots fired. Two officers down.
Two casualties. I repeat...

05:42.675 --> 05:46.975
Go on, you mad bastard.
T ell the boys to pull out.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.816
Six shots fired, two officers down,
two casualties.

05:50.883 --> 05:54.478
I repeat, two officers down.
Send blue lights. Over.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.760
K-9 response to Falls Road.
Six shots fired.

06:02.795 --> 06:05.593
Trying to locate gunman.
Looks IRA.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.662
we had real respect
for the IRA as a military force.

06:13.439 --> 06:15.066
we sealed the communities.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.702
Protestants one side of the wall,
Catholics on the other.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.971
The reality was we couldn't stop
what was happening...

06:20.012 --> 06:22.310
because we didn't have the minds
of the people.

06:23.716 --> 06:28.050
In war, truth is the first casualty, and
information is as powerful as bullets.

06:30.656 --> 06:33.523
Growing up an Irish Catholic lad in
a Republican community...

06:33.559 --> 06:37.495
where police and security forces were
not trusted, Martin had few choices.

06:38.264 --> 06:40.391
what are you talking about? You've
never done a day's work in your life...

06:40.400 --> 06:43.995
But he was his own man, and that meant
he had real potential to work with us.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.572
I really don't think stealing cars
is what you would call employment.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.597
-You know what I mean?
-lt depends on how you look at it.

06:48.674 --> 06:51.541
If the peelers catch you this time,
that's it, man. You're fucked.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.010
Sean, tell me you didn't
steal that car.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.009
I didn't steal that car.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.982
I knew someone like him could make
a real difference.

06:59.051 --> 07:00.518
All I had to do was convince him.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.484
where you off to, lads?

07:01.521 --> 07:03.011
Aye, we're just going to the shops,
you know.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.591
-All right. Name?
-Mickey Mouse.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.219
-Mickey, what street are you from?
-Sesame Street.

07:08.327 --> 07:10.591
No, it's Disneyland. Mickey Mouse
is Disneyland.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.427
Aye, right, Disneyland, eh?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.134
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are you going?

07:15.234 --> 07:18.101
Didn't you hear him, man? we're, like
we're just going to the shops a second.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.731
Me sister's birthday's coming up. we're
getting her a present. Is that okay?

07:20.873 --> 07:22.704
-Just a wee bike, aye?
-Name!.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.043
You fucking hard of hearing?
Mickey Mouse.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.906
what are you doing? what, are you
going to shoot him, is that it?

07:30.983 --> 07:34.180
Oh, now you're going to shoot me?
First you, and now it's me?

07:34.320 --> 07:35.685
Go ahead, man.
Shoot.

07:39.091 --> 07:42.322
Go on, man, fire away.
Fucking shoot me, man.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.599
Is someone going to do something
about this psycho here?

07:52.939 --> 07:54.531
It's all right.
Put it down.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.535
wait! After them, lads!

08:47.260 --> 08:48.284
Come on, move it!

08:53.533 --> 08:54.522
Peelers!

09:33.573 --> 09:34.870
This way, let's go!

09:50.856 --> 09:51.754
Fuck!

09:59.932 --> 10:00.899
Come on!

10:05.871 --> 10:10.035
After doing 90 on the Shankill,
your mate Sean spun out...

10:10.776 --> 10:13.745
took off before the officers
chasing him could say "wanker."'

10:18.684 --> 10:20.117
I gather you're in sales.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.148
A bloke like you
gets around the area.

10:29.061 --> 10:32.155
Not me, man. I make
it a point to see nothing.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.429
How about easy cash...

10:40.806 --> 10:43.934
the kind that doesn't see you going
to jail for selling stolen goods?

10:45.111 --> 10:49.047
I show you some faces, you tell us
what you see them doing.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.680
what makes you think that
I would be a tout for anybody?

10:55.921 --> 10:59.652
The comings and goings of neighbours
is not exactly being an informer...

10:59.659 --> 11:00.956
or a "tout, " as you call it.

11:03.462 --> 11:06.260
A car. No record.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.002
Not even on police files yet.

11:10.002 --> 11:13.403
Martin didn't go for any of our usual
offers or threats.

11:16.308 --> 11:20.005
He sold stolen goods in Catholic areas
against strict IRA rules...

11:20.112 --> 11:21.409
which were brutally enforced.

11:22.214 --> 11:23.909
Are we done?
Can I go now, please?

11:24.016 --> 11:25.347
That meant he wasn't afraid of them.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.840
All right.
Thank you very much.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.320
which is why I also knew
I could trust him.

11:30.856 --> 11:31.447
well?

11:32.558 --> 11:35.493
I'll take him out on a road test.

11:35.561 --> 11:39.793
If he's useless, I'll give him to Ml5,
tell them he's bloody brilliant.

11:55.514 --> 11:58.779
Jeez, Paddy. You watching
your family videos again?

11:59.985 --> 12:01.941
Ray here came by to make
your acquaintance.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.820
Marty's been working for me.
Like I say, he's a good lad.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.448
-ls he?
-Fuck this.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.493
Didn't have anything on you, did they?
Here you go, Paddy.

12:11.997 --> 12:14.431
Oh, Jesus.
How you doing, Ray?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.467
So, Martin, Sean here says
you're a good man.

12:17.803 --> 12:19.464
Look, man, I didn't see nothing.

12:19.538 --> 12:22.507
That's true, you didn't,
and you'll do well to remember that.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.909
I know your ma.
She's a good woman.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.247
-Thanks for what you did today.
-Aye, no problem.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.013
we'll not forget it.

12:37.022 --> 12:37.750
Aye.

12:44.396 --> 12:47.763
Sean, man, how do you know him?
He's lRA.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.761
-ls he now?
-Yeah, he is.

12:49.835 --> 12:50.927
where's me money?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.803
Paddy, is there any chance of getting
a pair of these, like, in black?

12:53.873 --> 12:54.897
Size eight?

12:55.674 --> 12:59.906
Please, God, no, it's a pipe. It's just
a pipe! The bathroom's just upstairs.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.243
Do I look like I shot anybody?

13:03.115 --> 13:05.345
what reason could you have
to search my house for guns?

13:05.417 --> 13:07.112
-I live here, okay?
-Two officers have just been shot.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.780
what else do I need know?

13:08.888 --> 13:10.150
where were you two hours ago?

13:10.222 --> 13:11.883
I was playing football, man.
where were you?

13:11.957 --> 13:14.050
-Bullshit!
-Don't! Don't!

13:15.394 --> 13:17.089
I didn't raise you to be thick
as a plank!

13:17.129 --> 13:19.996
Listen. If I find out you were
anywhere near this trouble...

13:20.065 --> 13:21.794
I'll drag you to the police myself!

13:21.867 --> 13:22.925
But I had nothing to do with it!

13:23.068 --> 13:26.128
Evil can only do its work if decent
ordinary people turn a blind eye...

13:26.806 --> 13:28.967
-even if only for a moment.
-Keep searching!

13:29.809 --> 13:32.937
He's made an impression on the lRA,
for sure, right up the line.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.038
From here on, I'm out.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.346
Can't figure out what you'd want
with a 10p hood like him.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.572
what's this? Huh?
what's this?

14:02.107 --> 14:04.803
what, you were heading round your Ma's
house and doing a wee bit of fixing?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.972
wouldn't be for stealing cars,
would it? Not our Frankie.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.548
Breaking into people's houses?
Yeah? Yeah?

14:11.650 --> 14:14.483
Joyriding their cars?
Now I'm hearing about drugs?

14:15.020 --> 14:18.547
These are crimes against the community,
and you've been found guilty.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.883
It's not me. I swear.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.192
what?

14:28.500 --> 14:29.831
Help, help!

14:33.205 --> 14:33.864
Fuck!

14:35.140 --> 14:35.902
what the...

14:40.346 --> 14:43.838
Fucking shit, is that it?
well, you're one lucky fucker, Frankie.

14:43.949 --> 14:47.316
If I'd have brought my.097, your
football career would've been done for.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.821
You want this lying down
or standing up?

14:51.423 --> 14:53.448
-Standing.
-Right.

14:55.227 --> 14:59.220
No! Fucking leave him!
Leave him!

15:00.065 --> 15:01.464
-My jeans!
-Fuck your jeans.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.627
The peelers mightn't give a shit
about our community...

15:04.637 --> 15:08.403
and how you wankers like you who fuck
it up for everyone, but we do, so...

15:09.441 --> 15:11.102
thank God for the lRA.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.168
Fucking bastard!

15:16.181 --> 15:17.978
Frankie! That's my brother!

15:20.185 --> 15:22.210
That's my wee brother!
Frankie!

15:24.189 --> 15:26.851
Funny coincidence running
into you, huh?

15:28.560 --> 15:29.891
Frankie! Frankie...

15:31.397 --> 15:34.230
That's for getting involved
in something that doesn't concern you.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.494
I'm assuming you have no plans
for this evening...

15:36.936 --> 15:38.961
because there's somebody
who wants to meet you.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.067
Fucking bastards!

15:47.813 --> 15:49.041
Fred, Fred?

15:49.682 --> 15:54.278
Do you know that kid, Martin McGartland?
well, I've taken a special interest.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.447
Goddamn it. That's been less
than 10 minutes.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.323
who told you about the meeting
going down with Mickey Johnson?

16:00.392 --> 16:01.324
Just lose the file.

16:02.594 --> 16:05.256
-And not a word to anyone, right?
-Yeah, right.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.368
Jesus Christ.

16:22.147 --> 16:26.379
Sorry about the drama.
You've got to be careful.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.950
would you get us some ice and
a tea towel there, love?

16:34.159 --> 16:36.286
I hear the Brits took your ma's
house apart.

16:37.997 --> 16:42.195
No warrant, no cause, picked you up
for questioning.

16:43.435 --> 16:44.766
Dogs have more rights.

16:47.906 --> 16:50.704
Here. Thanks, love. Away and make
yourself a wee cup of tea there.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.309
I can see you don't partake
in loose talk...

17:02.187 --> 17:03.745
or I'd be behind bars now.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.151
Seems to me like we're
on the same side.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.259
You're a go-getter.
I've been asking around.

17:14.366 --> 17:18.097
A kid like you deserves
to work at something, build a future.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.830
Do you know why you can't get a job?

17:22.741 --> 17:24.265
Because it makes you easier to beat.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.608
The Brits underestimate us.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.274
This war is being fought in our
own footpaths, in our gardens...

17:32.317 --> 17:33.545
in our living rooms.

17:35.387 --> 17:39.016
Makes for a special kind of man who's
defending his home and his community.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.215
I am thinking...

17:43.228 --> 17:47.130
maybe you'd want to be part of something
that's bigger than your skinny wee arse.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.769
It's bigger than mine.
It's as big as a country.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.776
well, do you want the job?

18:04.183 --> 18:05.309
Okay.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.382
Paddy's nothing but a wheeler-dealer.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.489
That's a sure way of getting
your legs broken.

18:12.257 --> 18:16.626
A fence is just a tout in training,
so you're finished with him.

18:16.728 --> 18:17.786
Okay?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.326
You got a car?

18:21.733 --> 18:23.257
Aye, I do.

18:23.802 --> 18:25.827
Mickey Johnson ran a taxi
company.

18:26.171 --> 18:29.663
He was also high up in the IRA, and
drivers were a perfect way to recruit.

18:30.109 --> 18:34.375
I knew Martin would be pissed off by
the IRA for taking out Frankie's knees.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.678
Maybe he'd see Mickey's job
as an opportunity to get a car...

18:37.749 --> 18:39.876
and to help us.
That was my hook.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.809
In my world, timing is everything
and occasionally, we get lucky.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.950
I've been asking around for you.
I'm glad you're okay.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.619
I'm fine, no problem.

18:50.028 --> 18:52.360
Come here, Frankie, I'll get you in.
You okay?

18:54.299 --> 18:56.859
Are you okay, man?
Look at me, Frankie.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.864
I'm sorry, mate, you know?

18:59.471 --> 19:01.939
I wish I could have helped you, man.
There was nothing I could have done.

19:02.040 --> 19:02.870
Okay?

19:04.309 --> 19:06.209
Frankie's got an appointment
at the Royal.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.102
Bloody taxis. we're very late.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.637
I'm sure we've completely missed
his doctor...

19:09.781 --> 19:12.147
and next week he goes
on Tuesday and Thursday.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.677
Maybe I can give you a lift, like.
I understand.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.981
-You got a car?
-Aye, definitely. Yeah.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.617
That'd be brilliant, wouldn't it,
Frankie?

19:20.425 --> 19:21.790
Tuesday would be grand.

19:23.028 --> 19:24.928
I'll pick you up on Tuesday, okay?

19:24.963 --> 19:26.225
-4:00?
-Aye, definitely.

19:45.450 --> 19:49.216
There's a right way and a wrong way
to do this. He's not in our pocket yet.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.687
Pick him up. Let's see
what he's made of.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.383
worst case, he ends up another
statistic in jail or the morgue.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.825
I don't see a downside.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.229
Aye, he doesn't listen to anybody.
That's his problem.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.732
-That's why he...
-wanker.

20:03.902 --> 20:04.960
what did you say?

20:06.071 --> 20:08.232
-would you take him off.
-Come here, love. Come here.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.399
what did you say, man?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.143
-Don't be starting anything, Marty...
-Did you say something to me?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.473
Marty, just walk away.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.506
Move on. Okay, move on.
Good man.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.510
Okay, why would you do that?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.521
why would you do that?
You're going to point that at me now?

20:23.655 --> 20:26.783
why would you do that?
what are you sick? Is that it?

20:27.492 --> 20:29.394
-Hey, get off!
-ls that it? Is that it?

20:29.394 --> 20:34.093
And with a wee baby about!
with a baby about!

20:34.499 --> 20:36.364
Against the wall, laddy.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.760
-Ma!
-Marty!

20:43.308 --> 20:44.775
-Fuck off.
-I'm his mother!

20:48.247 --> 20:50.477
Ma! I swear to God
I didn't do it!

20:51.416 --> 20:54.214
He's assaulted an officer and
now he's got to go to the station.

21:29.187 --> 21:32.714
Idiots were supposed to pick you up.
They weren't supposed to start a riot.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.815
what the hell's going on?
Are you setting me up?

21:34.893 --> 21:37.191
A desperate man goes to
desperate measures.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.454
I'm Fergus.

21:47.572 --> 21:49.870
That's a terrible thing happened
to your mate, Frankie.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.546
I'm sure the sister, Lara, forgot to
tell you her mother got the shoes.

21:56.581 --> 21:57.912
Thinks you're a rock star.

21:59.951 --> 22:03.284
Hopefully, I've impressed you with
our thoroughness because...

22:04.589 --> 22:06.420
I need your help.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.420
You met with Mickey Johnson.

22:12.597 --> 22:13.689
Never seen him.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.130
This is about lives and saving them.

22:16.968 --> 22:19.698
They'll do to you what they did to
Frankie, only worse.

22:19.771 --> 22:23.605
They're terrorists, killers who've
found a cause to kill for.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.699
Terrorists?

22:25.977 --> 22:27.604
Is that what you think, huh?
Terrorists?

22:28.880 --> 22:31.872
well, I don't see anyone tearing up
your house because you're lrish...

22:32.617 --> 22:34.016
hauling your arse onto the street...

22:34.086 --> 22:36.714
getting the shit kicked
out of you by soldiers for fun?

22:38.690 --> 22:42.626
The Brits have never been in lreland by
invitation, so who's the terrorist?

22:45.797 --> 22:47.890
I'm offering a job you
can feel good about.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.430
They'll offer you a job
that'll likely get you killed.

22:52.637 --> 22:55.128
It's harder to live for
your country than die for it.

22:57.175 --> 23:00.338
A car's expensive.
My gift to you. No strings.

23:01.246 --> 23:02.547
You see...

23:02.547 --> 23:04.481
I'm betting murder isn't in you.

23:05.450 --> 23:09.318
Memorize this number, then
flush the card. Call me anytime.

23:09.921 --> 23:12.685
Tell them your name is John Brown,
ask for Fergus. They'll find me.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.458
How do I know that's not
bugged or something?

23:15.861 --> 23:17.158
well, why would we bother?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.527
One phone call,
I know where you are.

23:28.507 --> 23:32.967
You want to give me money
and a car for nothing?

23:35.213 --> 23:36.578
That's fine by me.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.171
-Hop along, Frankie.
-Give me those.

24:07.345 --> 24:10.314
-How'd you afford a set of wheels?
-Because I got a job.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.178
You did? You got a real job?

24:12.250 --> 24:15.117
Aye, yeah, it's a real job.
I'm a taxi driver.

24:15.187 --> 24:18.088
-where's your license?
-Oh, you need a license now, do you?

24:18.190 --> 24:20.215
I thought we were in Belfast,
you wee shit.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.760
This is brilliant.
Look, don't mind our Frankie.

24:25.897 --> 24:26.886
Ah, he's fine.

24:30.635 --> 24:34.503
Listen, I was just wondering if
maybe I could take you out?

24:35.273 --> 24:37.901
You know, maybe see a film,
or some dinner, or something?

24:37.976 --> 24:41.742
-Sure. Dinner?
-Okay. Go on, then.

24:42.647 --> 24:45.172
Look, I think I'm free on Thursday.
Is that okay?

24:45.283 --> 24:47.012
-Okay. You're on.
-Okay.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.450
Frankie, don't mind him.
He's got a real job, you know.

24:53.558 --> 24:54.786
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.564
-So where are we going, anyway?
-The Europa Hotel, man.

25:02.667 --> 25:06.194
I need you to pick my daughter up for
school in the morning. Is that okay?

25:06.304 --> 25:07.669
Aye, no problem.

25:10.108 --> 25:11.973
-Nice shirt.
-what, this?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.809
I can pick one up for you,
if you like.

25:16.047 --> 25:17.605
Come on, it's not like that.

25:18.316 --> 25:22.150
-So, how do you like driving a taxi?
-It beats working for Paddy.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.656
-No complaints about the hours?
-No, no, I like it.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.155
You're one of my best drivers.

25:27.225 --> 25:29.693
You're reliable, and that counts
for everything in life.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.753
You know who you remind me of?

25:31.796 --> 25:35.323
I don't remind you of anybody
because I'm not like anybody else.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.702
My ma always said I'm like
one in a million.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.897
A million. That's what my
ma always told me I was.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.369
Aye, you're full of shit.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.864
-who do I remind you of?
-wee Aggie.

25:44.442 --> 25:45.409
who's Aggie?

25:46.278 --> 25:49.975
I wouldn't trust him with my wife,
but I trust him with my life.

26:07.365 --> 26:09.185
I've got a bloody spring in me arse.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.600
No wonder your aunt gave you
this shitbox for free.

26:11.670 --> 26:12.602
Up yours, man.

26:13.838 --> 26:16.238
I tell you what, I could have
got you a deal on a real car.

26:16.841 --> 26:19.674
what, and end up with the peelers
on my tail, man? No thank you.

26:19.744 --> 26:20.676
You're a tube.

26:22.213 --> 26:23.339
-There he is.
-Here he comes.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.346
Sean, where are you going, man?

26:32.924 --> 26:34.653
You'll catch up with Sean later.

26:36.227 --> 26:38.092
If God is good, and we're lucky.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.566
we're going for a spin.
Follow that car.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.063
It's a nice day.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.842
Go north to the M5.
Head for Lorne.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.779
Look, man, I'm sorry, but
I was pretty much finished my shift.

27:00.785 --> 27:04.312
-I got a big, big night coming up.
-You'll be finished when I am finished.

27:04.889 --> 27:07.619
Fine. I'll just keep
my mouth shut then, will l?

27:14.366 --> 27:16.926
Turn left into that parking lot
there and park.

27:17.435 --> 27:18.265
Aye.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.663
Just over there.

27:24.809 --> 27:27.334
You stay here.
I'll look and be right back.

27:28.079 --> 27:30.775
And then you can get
on with your big night.

27:31.449 --> 27:32.916
Now, is there a problem?

27:34.085 --> 27:35.279
-No problem.
-Good.

28:19.964 --> 28:23.024
Good enough.
Let's go.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.141
Hello, yeah. Could I speak
to Fergus, please?

28:39.984 --> 28:43.442
My name? John.
John Brown.

28:46.257 --> 28:48.987
So whatever you want to do.
Like, just wear something slinky.

28:48.993 --> 28:51.962
It's a really fancy place.
I'll pick you up at 8:00, okay?

28:52.464 --> 28:55.092
All right, speak soon. I'll be there
at 8:00. All right, bye-bye.

28:56.534 --> 28:58.069
Sounds like Marty's got a date.

28:58.069 --> 29:01.937
I do, I do, but I'm sorry, Ray,
you know, you're just not invited.

29:03.208 --> 29:03.936
Listen...

29:05.176 --> 29:05.972
take her...

29:07.011 --> 29:08.979
take her somewhere nice. Yeah?

29:26.097 --> 29:27.826
Oh, my God, it's on fire!

29:28.233 --> 29:29.860
Is it meant to do that?

29:29.934 --> 29:31.697
It's the chef's signature dish.

29:33.238 --> 29:36.799
Of course.
It looks smashing.

29:37.308 --> 29:39.367
Aye, it does. It really does.

29:39.944 --> 29:40.911
My pleasure.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.573
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

29:44.649 --> 29:47.550
-So you never answered my question.
-what question was that?

29:47.585 --> 29:49.109
Don't duck it.
You have an opinion.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.385
I'm not ducking. I'm not.
I don't have an opinion.

29:53.057 --> 29:55.787
You're lrish, aren't you?
You were born with an opinion.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.222
what are you thinking?

30:01.065 --> 30:04.831
I was thinking whether your ma liked
them shoes that I got her.

30:04.936 --> 30:06.028
That's what I was thinking.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.595
Yes. She practically slept
with them on.

30:09.073 --> 30:11.405
-Did she?
-You achieved sainthood.

30:14.078 --> 30:14.840
So?

30:17.549 --> 30:19.517
Look, how did we get from me being
thrown out of school...

30:19.617 --> 30:21.847
to suddenly my belief
in God, anyway?

30:22.720 --> 30:26.622
Like, I want to know about you, like.
Like, what's your favourite band?

30:29.727 --> 30:32.525
Okay, I'm not saying I don't believe
in God. Like, I do believe in God...

30:33.164 --> 30:35.223
but He's probably not a Catholic God.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.868
Right, I don't think God's
sitting on a cloud...

30:37.936 --> 30:40.632
trying to figure out whether
He's Protestant, or Catholic...

30:40.738 --> 30:42.205
or fucking Buddhist either.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.999
Everyone's got these big opinions
about how you should live...

30:46.010 --> 30:47.102
and who you should love.

30:47.645 --> 30:51.979
The government, the peelers, the
Catholics, the Protestants, the Brits.

30:52.116 --> 30:55.415
Any of them is full of it if they
think that they know more about you...

30:55.486 --> 30:58.887
or that they know more about me
or of God than anybody else.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.785
It seems to me they're more interested
in killing than living anyway...

31:02.927 --> 31:06.294
which, I mean, is hard enough to do and
then keep up with the everyday shit.

31:14.138 --> 31:18.666
Morrissey, Guns 'n Roses,
the Pogues, and U2, of course.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.906
Jimmy Page is probably one of
the finest guitar players alive...

31:23.381 --> 31:25.781
and Prince is great for having sex.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.108
where are we, anyway?

32:32.283 --> 32:33.443
we're in Lorne.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.554
You know, someone told me about
this pub.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.419
Do you want to check it out?

32:40.825 --> 32:42.122
what's going on there?

32:57.608 --> 33:00.008
-Do you know him?
-Don't know him. Don't know him.

33:00.678 --> 33:01.406
Get back.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.614
You get out of here.
Come on, move it. Move it.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.477
Okay. we're moving!

33:08.786 --> 33:09.980
Move it back now!

33:27.171 --> 33:29.469
I ever tell you I wanted to go
to Disney world before I die?

33:30.541 --> 33:34.637
Aye, you don't stop going on about
it, you and Minnie Mouse.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.773
Tell you what, give us a lift home.

33:40.284 --> 33:41.308
I always give you a lift.

33:45.289 --> 33:46.756
You rode Lara, didn't you?

33:48.526 --> 33:52.428
You keep track of her period, or
else you'll be shopping for nappies.

33:53.297 --> 33:54.198
Good man.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.098
what, I'm taking advice from
the model da now, is that it?

33:56.200 --> 33:57.201
My kids are beautiful.

33:57.201 --> 34:00.295
Besides, being a da's not easy.
It's got its responsibilities and...

34:00.371 --> 34:01.895
Fuck me. How you doing?

34:03.841 --> 34:04.808
That's a nice bum.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.838
what are you sucking on today?
It's one for our side.

34:14.217 --> 34:15.047
Look...

34:16.054 --> 34:20.013
you got to expect a bit of killing
and a bit of dying in a revolution.

34:20.757 --> 34:22.225
That's the way things work.

34:24.328 --> 34:26.659
Besides, you're not a man unless
you've got a cause.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.059
Give us a lift.

34:37.507 --> 34:39.793
Two soldiers died, two more
are critical.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.141
Look, I didn't see anything.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.940
why are you working for them?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.639
I'm not working for them like that.

34:45.349 --> 34:48.806
I've been driving Mickey around, they
asked me to pick up Quinn, so I did.

34:48.953 --> 34:51.513
-And they trust you?
-Like I said, it's not like that.

34:53.690 --> 34:54.589
why?

34:58.629 --> 34:59.891
well, you called me.

35:00.364 --> 35:02.264
why? what's different?

35:05.736 --> 35:06.964
Everything.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.372
Everything.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.437
You can move on the inside.

35:18.449 --> 35:23.580
Dead men will be walking around and
becoming grandfathers because of you.

35:25.022 --> 35:27.422
That's my community.
Like, I know some of these people.

35:29.727 --> 35:30.853
Memorize this.

35:37.201 --> 35:38.828
Here's your petrol money.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.283
-Thanks for the tea.
-Anytime.

36:06.597 --> 36:08.087
Fuck! Stop him!

36:10.334 --> 36:11.301
Hold it!

36:13.337 --> 36:16.238
-Don't you fucking move!
-All right, don't shoot!

36:16.607 --> 36:20.566
Okay, lads! Make sure you're at the
Upland place by 12:00 noon tomorrow.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.447
Mickey, you take the back roads,
dump the cars there and split.

36:24.815 --> 36:26.339
Johnny will look after things here...

36:26.350 --> 36:29.319
and lads, make sure no one sees you.
Okay, let's go!

36:55.012 --> 36:57.378
-It's an odds thing.
-what is?

36:58.916 --> 37:00.645
If the peelers get one of the cars...

37:00.718 --> 37:03.619
the other two are more likely
to get through if we're in a pack.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.358
Besides, with a cargo like this,
it keeps us all honest.

37:11.829 --> 37:12.727
Shit.

37:18.402 --> 37:20.461
Sean, what are you doing, man?
Put that away.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.968
I'm serious, put it away.
Put it away.

37:24.408 --> 37:27.377
If this thing blows,
I'll be Jesse Fucking James.

37:35.853 --> 37:37.343
Sean, you put that away, man.

37:38.522 --> 37:40.649
Fucking put it away.
Put it away.

37:44.528 --> 37:47.053
-That's quite a car.
-Yeah, it's my da's.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.061
where are you off to today, son?

37:51.602 --> 37:54.230
we're just, uh, picking him up
at the airport, like.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.240
You're a long way out of your way.

37:56.907 --> 38:00.399
well, we had to go to my sister's.
Like, she's moving, so...

38:00.544 --> 38:02.239
we're just on our way back round.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.407
-Can I see your license, please?
-Aye, then.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.753
I told my da to keep it in there.
I think he must have forgot.

38:12.823 --> 38:14.415
May I take a look in the boot, please?

38:14.558 --> 38:15.616
Aye, no problem.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.366
You know what's happened?
This is a spare set of keys.

38:28.472 --> 38:31.771
My da's got the main set.
It's not going to work the boot.

38:32.576 --> 38:35.204
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If I give you a number...

38:35.313 --> 38:36.780
maybe you can speak to my sister.

38:36.847 --> 38:39.475
Have you got a pen?
I can write it down for you.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.548
My da'll beat my arse if I'm late,
you know what I mean?

38:47.591 --> 38:51.925
If you could just tell him that you're
calling about Martin McGartland. Okay?

39:01.939 --> 39:02.803
Here, mate.

39:26.163 --> 39:28.825
She says she has your keys.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.025
Okay.
Thank you.

39:31.635 --> 39:32.693
That's great, thank you.

39:56.293 --> 39:59.319
They got nothing on us, they don't.
So who the fuck's your sister?

39:59.930 --> 40:02.421
It was my ma.
Fucking, my ma!

40:02.533 --> 40:06.469
Your ma? Bloody hell.
Me ma would have let them have me.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.006
Good work, man.

40:13.144 --> 40:13.872
Bloody hell...

40:16.147 --> 40:18.638
An RUC patrol calling me like
I was your sister?

40:18.749 --> 40:20.148
Hey, come on, I was brilliant.

40:20.751 --> 40:24.118
Stupid risks cost lives,
including yours.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.485
So you're my da now?
Just get the guns.

40:29.326 --> 40:31.692
Today in Belfast, residents
of a middle class...

40:31.762 --> 40:34.526
Detectives said it was highly
significant...

40:34.598 --> 40:36.065
and certainly it was curious.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.465
The weapons ranging
from old hunting rifles...

40:38.536 --> 40:42.165
A haul of nearly 1 00 guns
including Kalashnikov rifles...

40:42.173 --> 40:44.641
has been discovered by police
in the boots of two cars...

40:44.708 --> 40:48.474
Three men have been arrested, believed
to have connections with the IRA...

40:54.718 --> 40:55.776
Come on, let's go.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.448
-who is that?
-He's a target.

40:58.522 --> 41:00.149
And what are you asking
questions for?

41:18.976 --> 41:21.706
Listen, Marty, it could just
as easily be him...

41:22.213 --> 41:25.671
scouting you and your family.
Go.

41:27.551 --> 41:29.610
It's the Protestant church
near North Road.

41:30.621 --> 41:31.918
Our target's got three wee girls.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.213
what else?

41:35.826 --> 41:38.659
Look, this guy's got a family as well.
He's just doing his job, you know?

41:41.765 --> 41:44.598
Okay, Ray O'Brien is the shooter.
That's it.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.098
what about Sean?

41:47.204 --> 41:49.638
I don't know nothing about Sean.
I told you that.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.840
You don't get to pick and choose.
This is all in.

41:53.577 --> 41:57.741
Because I finger you, you're dead.
You finger me, I'm dead, so...

41:59.783 --> 42:00.875
there we are.

42:05.422 --> 42:06.912
I want to show you something.

42:26.977 --> 42:30.572
He has a kid. A ma, a da.

42:33.617 --> 42:35.676
-ls he a tout?
-A tout?

42:37.688 --> 42:42.785
He saved at least 30 lives, probably
more. He's a goddamned hero.

42:44.094 --> 42:48.690
Your mates tortured him for seven days,
168 hours until we found him.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.270
Sean doesn't get arrested.

42:54.305 --> 42:59.333
A 400-pound bomb was your mate's
latest gift to the city of Belfast.

42:59.443 --> 43:02.207
Seven people died, and
you don't want him arrested?

43:02.913 --> 43:05.973
He's my mate. He's got two kids
from two different women...

43:06.083 --> 43:08.142
Aw, give me a hankie.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.216
No way. I can't do it.
There's no deal. No way.

43:13.857 --> 43:15.188
Then there's no deal.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.131
what if I give you every detail
of every move he makes?

43:24.234 --> 43:25.929
You can shut him down, like.

43:26.870 --> 43:29.236
Come on, I'm into saving my mates
as much as yours.

43:31.775 --> 43:35.370
Look at him.
Can't you just look at him?

43:39.783 --> 43:44.277
It's a dirty war, and everyone seems
to think the end justifies the means...

43:44.321 --> 43:48.280
which is why you and your mate
are even walking around.

43:52.696 --> 43:53.924
How do you know I can do it?

43:57.801 --> 44:01.066
You've got no choice.
Neither have l.

44:02.806 --> 44:04.501
I'm not looking for a da.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.041
Just...

44:08.812 --> 44:10.780
don't get yourself killed.

44:33.470 --> 44:34.630
How's it going?

44:35.005 --> 44:36.495
-How you doing?
-Yeah, not bad.

44:37.474 --> 44:38.634
It's cold out, isn't it?

44:39.176 --> 44:41.474
-Aye. That time of year, isn't it?
-Aye, definitely.

44:42.212 --> 44:44.009
-ls this all your gang, is it?
-Yeah.

44:44.114 --> 44:45.706
-Hi. what's your name?
-Jane.

44:45.816 --> 44:49.013
Jane, is it? Hello, Jane.
I like your jacket, Jane.

44:49.753 --> 44:50.947
-And what's your name?
-Catherine.

44:51.021 --> 44:52.318
Catherine, and what about you?

44:53.557 --> 44:54.581
You ready?

44:55.025 --> 44:56.492
You're cheeky, you are, aren't you?

44:57.861 --> 45:00.386
-See you later.
-Anyway, take it easy. Have a good one.

45:15.979 --> 45:16.968
Martin...

45:20.884 --> 45:22.749
-what?
-I'm pregnant.

45:25.989 --> 45:27.320
Are you sure?

45:27.825 --> 45:32.956
I did a home pregnancy test and
at the hospital. Yeah, I'm sure.

45:34.732 --> 45:37.758
That's something, isn't it?

45:39.169 --> 45:41.057
That's brilliant, then.
That's fantastic.

45:41.071 --> 45:41.969
Really?

45:44.808 --> 45:47.242
Come on, what did you think
I was going to say?

45:48.278 --> 45:49.336
I don't know.

45:53.183 --> 45:57.051
-what about my ma?
-Oh, shit, your ma.

45:58.489 --> 45:59.456
Shit, my ma.

45:59.923 --> 46:00.947
Marty?

46:01.024 --> 46:03.720
I have the washing,
but I can't find that blue shirt.

46:04.027 --> 46:05.688
what were you doing with the blue...

46:07.397 --> 46:09.888
Lara, love, you can come out now.

46:15.939 --> 46:20.103
Look, the two of you are adults,
but if you get yourself pregnant...

46:20.110 --> 46:23.307
well, don't go expecting your
parents to treat you any different.

46:26.049 --> 46:30.918
Oh, my. well, then, I guess
a congratulations is in order.

46:33.390 --> 46:36.120
Your father wasn't much of a man
to look to, but you're not him.

46:36.226 --> 46:38.285
You'll do the right thing,
or I'll kill you myself.

46:38.328 --> 46:39.317
Ma, for Christ's sake.

46:39.963 --> 46:42.659
well, I'll leave you to make a plan.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.795
-Sorry.
-There's lots to think about.

46:51.074 --> 46:51.938
Oh, shit...

46:56.880 --> 46:58.142
I was so worried.

47:00.717 --> 47:01.615
Me too.

47:04.621 --> 47:05.485
You okay?

47:11.261 --> 47:13.354
I'm not going to piss off like
my own da, man.

47:14.464 --> 47:15.795
I'm going to stick around...

47:15.899 --> 47:18.163
give the kid a wee bit of advice
here and there, you know?

47:23.907 --> 47:26.102
So it's going down on Friday.
You going to be ready?

47:26.176 --> 47:29.202
I'll be ready. You're worse
than my own ma.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.205
I just don't want you
to embarrass me is all.

47:34.017 --> 47:36.247
You wouldn't embarrass me,
now, would you?

47:42.960 --> 47:43.984
wanker.

47:45.195 --> 47:47.390
So, lover boy,
what are you going to do...

47:47.397 --> 47:49.991
when Lara's ma finds out that
you knocked up her daughter?

47:50.601 --> 47:54.401
Don't you worry about that one.
There's no way we're shacking up.

47:57.941 --> 47:58.873
I've got it.

47:58.942 --> 48:01.410
-who is it?
-I don't know. I'm just getting it.

48:05.382 --> 48:09.182
I've nowhere else to go.
My mummy, she found out.

48:14.424 --> 48:17.154
Jeez, look.
we can't live here, really.

48:19.429 --> 48:21.397
You want to shack up?

48:23.734 --> 48:26.931
Aye. Aye, definitely.
Come here.

48:29.506 --> 48:31.642
we'll be all right,
right, baby?

48:31.642 --> 48:34.873
Marty McGartland, you're
full of surprises.

48:34.978 --> 48:38.414
Aye, I know.
Now, come on, get inside.

48:39.249 --> 48:40.716
I've got school every day, so, like...

48:40.817 --> 48:42.648
Hey, hey, listen, you don't have
to worry about that.

48:42.719 --> 48:45.051
I'm fully employed. You know that?
You know that?

48:47.724 --> 48:48.656
I love you.

48:52.262 --> 48:53.160
Me too.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.795
Okay, look, at the Portsmouth ferry...

48:58.936 --> 49:02.269
there's a boatload of soldiers going
to England, right, on the 18th.

49:02.739 --> 49:04.707
Now, they're going to hit the vans
waiting in the queue.

49:04.741 --> 49:07.972
I guess too many civilians for the boat
itself makes for bad press, you know?

49:10.647 --> 49:13.116
Now, I know they got a shitload
of Semtex.

49:13.116 --> 49:15.482
They've got a load of weapons,
make sure this really goes off.

49:16.653 --> 49:18.678
-You know what Mickey said to me?
-what?

49:20.390 --> 49:22.984
He said he was so pleased with
the Upland operation...

49:24.294 --> 49:26.524
that he's bumping me up
to B Battalion.

49:27.764 --> 49:29.391
-Yes!
-I thought you'd like that.

49:29.499 --> 49:31.228
-I like that.
-Yeah, I thought you would.

49:31.234 --> 49:32.565
-You know what else he said?
-what?

49:32.602 --> 49:37.665
-He's sending me to meet McFarlane.
-Oh, come on, it's bloody brilliant.

49:38.508 --> 49:39.566
That's bloody brilliant.

49:40.077 --> 49:43.843
I'm here to prepare volunteers, in case
you get interrogated by the police.

49:44.581 --> 49:47.778
They'll come in banging in the middle
of the night, screaming to confuse you.

49:48.318 --> 49:51.253
Press this button to get directly
through to me.

49:51.688 --> 49:53.713
Punch in a number, I'll call you.

49:54.524 --> 49:55.388
Okay.

49:56.159 --> 50:00.721
Appliance of science, that's brilliant.
I like that. Very James Bond.

50:01.164 --> 50:04.759
Ask the Duty Sergeant to see the doctor,
before they beat you.

50:05.769 --> 50:09.000
The harder they hit,
the harder you hit back.

50:10.340 --> 50:13.776
Curl up in a ball and protect
your head. You'll need it.

50:14.177 --> 50:17.510
Unless, of course, they cuff you,
in which case you're fucked.

50:19.850 --> 50:20.874
Aye, I know what I'm doing.

50:21.084 --> 50:22.051
-Oh, yeah?
-Aye.

50:23.053 --> 50:26.022
Do you know they'll hold your head
under water till your eyes are spinning?

50:26.823 --> 50:28.814
Again and again, for a couple of hours.

50:28.925 --> 50:30.893
If they won't let you
go to the toilet...

50:31.028 --> 50:33.622
you strip right down in front
of them and take a shit.

50:33.663 --> 50:35.790
They'll squeeze your balls with
a pair of pliers.

50:36.500 --> 50:38.331
They'll twist your thumbs
out of their sockets.

50:39.202 --> 50:40.396
Okay, man, like, I get it.

50:40.670 --> 50:43.070
You say one thing, they'll
have you for seven years.

50:43.673 --> 50:45.971
You'll say whatever they want
to hear to make it stop.

50:46.309 --> 50:50.336
Think. Outsmart them, but never
underestimate them.

50:51.848 --> 50:55.181
You admit to anything, you'll end up in
a ditch with a cattle prod up your arse.

50:56.319 --> 50:58.981
My car's marked, right?
You bugged my place.

50:59.222 --> 51:00.621
I've got this wee buzzer here.

51:02.225 --> 51:04.557
Look, there's someone on my tail
24 hours a day.

51:04.928 --> 51:06.828
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
I don't worry.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.602
I would get up there
if you'd get up there...

51:15.705 --> 51:18.037
but there's no way
I'm going on my own. No way.

51:19.076 --> 51:22.068
The bloody British. They found
out about the Portsmouth operation.

51:22.412 --> 51:23.344
No shit.

51:24.948 --> 51:27.610
So, ladies, what
are we celebrating on?

51:28.251 --> 51:32.347
-we just passed our exams, we did.
-Aye, this one got here two As.

51:32.422 --> 51:33.946
-And a B.
-Two As and a B.

51:34.724 --> 51:37.056
-well, cheers to that.
-Cheers.

51:41.998 --> 51:45.058
Don't you worry about this, all right?
I'll go get the next round.

51:45.168 --> 51:46.226
Give us a hand, eh, Marty?

51:46.837 --> 51:48.600
-Sean, I don't drink.
-Give us a hand.

51:48.672 --> 51:51.232
-I know you're not.
-Excuse me, ladies.

51:53.376 --> 51:55.037
Two lagers, please.

51:58.748 --> 52:00.272
There's a fucking leak.

52:03.286 --> 52:06.847
They got everything.
Bloody waste of Semtex, it was.

52:08.558 --> 52:09.752
Brit blood would've spilled.

52:09.826 --> 52:11.794
Aye, Jesus Christ, what a waste.

52:12.762 --> 52:16.220
If we didn't have bad luck,
we'd have no fucking luck at all.

52:16.666 --> 52:18.429
Fucking peelers, man.

52:20.403 --> 52:21.631
Peeler, yeah.

52:23.206 --> 52:26.266
It's times like this, you know,
it makes you think about your family...

52:26.910 --> 52:28.969
and puts it all into perspective.

52:29.646 --> 52:32.137
I want to see
my damn kids, you know.

52:32.883 --> 52:34.373
Anyway...

52:38.488 --> 52:41.457
-what's with him?
-He's just drunk.

52:42.592 --> 52:43.752
-Feel that?
-Did it kick?

52:44.494 --> 52:47.019
-ls it kicking?
-It's a ballerina in there.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.155
-That is a footballer, I'm telling you.
-It's a ballerina.

52:49.232 --> 52:49.926
It's a footballer.

52:49.966 --> 52:51.433
Let's go home and have
a fight about it.

52:51.501 --> 52:52.798
Okay, let's fight on it.

52:52.936 --> 52:55.302
Did you know, pregnant girls
are extra horny?

52:55.338 --> 52:57.602
-Let's definitely go home, then.
-Let's go.

52:59.876 --> 53:02.345
You're making me and the whole
department look really brilliant.

53:02.345 --> 53:05.212
Mickey wouldn't let me dodge
this meeting.

53:05.348 --> 53:06.713
The head of security's going to be
there.

53:06.783 --> 53:09.911
-You don't think they're onto me?
-No, they're going to test you.

53:09.986 --> 53:11.248
Do whatever they ask.

53:11.321 --> 53:14.813
If they suspect you're not 1 00%
you'll be out or dead, and, well...

53:14.891 --> 53:17.451
we have no one moving
up the inside like you.

53:17.460 --> 53:18.620
Aye. Okay.

53:18.662 --> 53:21.722
I'll meet you at 5:00
the usual place. Good luck.

53:31.841 --> 53:32.899
Cut him down.

53:40.217 --> 53:41.514
Sean... Sean...

53:42.319 --> 53:43.581
Come on, let's get out.

53:44.387 --> 53:45.911
I want to hear him say it.

53:46.022 --> 53:48.320
Hey, come on, he'll say
anything right about now.

53:54.664 --> 53:56.928
-what are you going to do with that?
-Relax, relax, relax.

53:58.101 --> 53:59.125
You're a good lad.

54:01.972 --> 54:03.963
I want to know about the operation
on Portsmouth...

54:05.575 --> 54:06.576
what you told the cops.

54:06.576 --> 54:09.010
I don't know anything about
the operation.

54:16.519 --> 54:17.986
what did you tell them?

54:18.054 --> 54:19.256
Nothing.

54:19.256 --> 54:23.386
Both teams are being very cautious.
Nobody is taking the chance.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.662
-what's the score, Sean?
-It's nil-nil.

54:31.434 --> 54:33.402
No, no, please! No, no!

54:36.439 --> 54:38.031
How'd the cops get you to talk?

54:41.144 --> 54:42.042
Money?

54:44.414 --> 54:46.405
It's not much good
to you now, is it?

54:48.118 --> 54:49.983
what are you going
to do with those?

54:51.821 --> 54:53.083
You're a tout.
what are you?

54:53.623 --> 54:54.783
I'm not! I'm not!

54:57.360 --> 54:58.190
what are you?

55:00.630 --> 55:01.790
Nothing!

55:02.632 --> 55:03.894
what are you?

55:04.000 --> 55:08.369
A tout. A tout...

55:10.573 --> 55:12.473
Sean, Sean, turn that off.

55:13.777 --> 55:17.440
All right, lads, listen up.
Speak into that.

55:23.787 --> 55:24.811
I'm a tout.

55:26.456 --> 55:30.483
Just tell my mom I said sorry.
Just tell her I'm sorry.

55:33.330 --> 55:34.456
Good man.

55:35.832 --> 55:36.890
Marty...

55:37.667 --> 55:38.861
Marty, come here.

55:43.173 --> 55:44.105
He's a tout.

55:50.613 --> 55:53.673
He's a tout. Stuff him.

56:02.058 --> 56:03.821
Don't. Don't, please.

56:03.893 --> 56:06.123
Come on, brother, we haven't all day.
Come on.

56:06.529 --> 56:09.362
Do it! Just fucking do it!

56:09.432 --> 56:11.559
No, don't!
Don't kill me! Don't!

56:14.704 --> 56:16.501
what the fuck was that about?

56:16.706 --> 56:19.937
It's my operation.
He's my tout.

56:24.013 --> 56:25.139
Get him out of here.

56:29.886 --> 56:31.513
You... clean up this mess.

56:47.737 --> 56:49.136
You knew this was going to happen.

56:49.205 --> 56:51.765
And you didn't? They completely
trust you now.

56:52.308 --> 56:54.037
I had a gun at his head, like.

56:54.677 --> 56:57.373
You said I couldn't do it.
You said I didn't have murder in me.

56:57.480 --> 56:58.071
well...

56:58.148 --> 57:00.742
Yeah, well, I was so scared,
I swear to God, I might have done it.

57:00.750 --> 57:04.618
I lied.
we all have murder in us.

57:05.889 --> 57:06.548
You?

57:07.690 --> 57:09.590
The hunters become the hunted, yes.

57:09.959 --> 57:12.325
Is that what you
tell yourself to make it all okay?

57:12.695 --> 57:14.595
The price of a conscience is death.

57:15.765 --> 57:17.528
None of us can afford it.

57:22.505 --> 57:25.963
They're swearing me in.
I'm going to be a full volunteer.

57:27.243 --> 57:28.767
Do you have any idea
what that means...

57:28.878 --> 57:31.278
to the next person you're going
to save, and the next?

57:33.716 --> 57:34.978
I put a block on your house.

57:35.084 --> 57:36.984
It means it's off limits
to the peelers.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.854
Store weapons for the lRA.

57:39.889 --> 57:41.914
we'll jark them and trace every
time they're moved.

57:44.894 --> 57:47.055
89 Cutland Road, all right?

57:48.531 --> 57:50.931
There's an RUC officer who's
going to be hit there Friday.

57:53.736 --> 57:55.795
They're going to blow him up
with a car bomb.

57:58.107 --> 58:00.234
Now, is that it? Because
I'd like to get out now, please.

58:20.830 --> 58:27.463
I don't blame the RUC for
turning my son into an informer.

58:29.305 --> 58:32.638
I don't blame
the lRA for killing him.

58:34.110 --> 58:40.948
I blame me son for the choice he
made to go against his family...

58:41.851 --> 58:43.011
and his community.

58:53.229 --> 58:54.753
It doesn't get any easier, son.

58:55.698 --> 58:59.634
It's all about saving lives,
isn't it? It's got to be done.

59:01.704 --> 59:04.605
I dream that one day we'll walk
as free men in our own country.

59:06.242 --> 59:09.507
The British have made us into
their poor, stupid cousins.

59:10.813 --> 59:12.303
The lRA is here to show them...

59:12.849 --> 59:15.909
that an ounce of resistance
is worth a pound of votes.

59:16.553 --> 59:19.044
-Do you know who said that?
-No.

59:19.088 --> 59:20.055
Bobby Sands.

59:20.657 --> 59:24.855
He was quoting Vladimir Lenin,
mastermind of the Russian revolution.

59:27.196 --> 59:30.563
He changed the world,
and built a nation.

59:45.315 --> 59:47.783
You've been through
the lectures and the books.

59:47.850 --> 59:48.908
Aye.

59:48.918 --> 59:50.977
-Have you been green booked?
-Aye.

59:51.387 --> 59:54.982
Then you know volunteers who engage
in loose talk shall be dismissed.

59:56.392 --> 59:59.122
Volunteers found guilty of treason
face the death penalty.

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:01.321
I understand.

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:06.801
This is no picnic.
You'll end up dead or in jail.

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.332
There's no going back.
Once you're in, you're in.

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:14.740
You understand your responsibility
in the community?

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.042
People look up to you.
Behave accordingly.

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:23.685
You've already passed their security,
and Mickey here says you're a good lad.

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:25.754
So...

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.689
I, Martin McGartland...

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:37.127
promise to promote the objects
of the Oglaigh na hEireann...

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:39.258
to the best of my knowledge
and ability...

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:46.875
to obey all orders and regulations
issued to me by the army authority...

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.741
and by my superior officer.

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.746
Martin McGartland...

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:56.342
you are now a full volunteer
of the lrish Republican Army.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.382
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. Thank you.

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:06.027
Come on. Come on.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:13.897
I'm proud of you, son.

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:19.205
The fucking Brits took
my son away from me.

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:24.173
I will never let that happen
to you. Okay?

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:27.078
Sorry.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:32.744
-Big things next year.
-Aye, okay.

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.695
Don't mess this up, Marty.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.868
Come on, man, give us my flag.

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.803
You'll have it when you're dead.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:56.038
Marty. Hang about.
There's someone I want you to meet.

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:04.952
Listen, one of our top operatives
needs a right hand man, okay?

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:08.455
Hello, gents.

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:11.690
This the Marty you've all
been talking about?

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:15.357
They call me Grace.

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:17.126
Hi. I'm Marty.
It's a pleasure.

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.992
I think Marty's going to enjoy
this assignment.

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:21.867
Yeah, okay...

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:29.236
-Grace Sterrin.
-Oh, aye.

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:34.875
-what, you know her, do you?
-I know Grace, yeah.

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:38.352
well, then you'll know she's
a nice, nice, nice looking lady.

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:40.651
we've been trying
to get her for years.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.521
She's senior intelligence.
Uses her body like Mata Hari.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.561
Right, and I would definitely...
I mean, I would have to be forced.

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:49.893
I would consider...
I would definitely give her one.

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:51.158
You and a few others.

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.967
-Oh, you would as well, would you?
-Oh... wouldn't you like to know?

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.560
All right, you know what?
I would like to know, yeah.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:58.162
-wouldn't you like to fucking know?
-ln fact, no, I don't want to know.

01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:00.266
I don't want to know what's going on
in your dirty mind.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:04.209
She's a big fish, which means
she makes everyone nervous.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.947
People are idiots when they're nervous.
That makes them easy.

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:21.858
Okay, stay outside.

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.892
Mickey told me I could
come in with you.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:26.799
He's a worrier. Nothing's going
to happen that I don't want to happen.

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.496
Mickey said, so I've got
to do it, okay?

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:33.967
If I'm not out in 10 minutes, go home,
because it means I'm dead, okay?

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.111
-Hiya.
-Hi.

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:39.145
Cheers.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.212
You've reached the home
of Lara and Marty.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:47.278
Please leave a message.

01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:49.988
Hey, Lara, it's me.

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:52.223
Just letting you know I'm not going
to be too much longer.

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:54.562
I'll be home pretty soon, okay?

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:58.225
And I was also wondering if there
was any chance you could...

01:03:58.267 --> 01:04:00.963
make me that special apple
crumble that you make?

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:04.097
If you could get
that going for dessert...

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.232
that would make a working
man very, very happy.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:07.741
Apple crumble?

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:12.074
Listen, I got to go.
Okay, bye.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.818
You know, you really shouldn't
knock it till you try it.

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.051
I don't cook.

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:21.082
what happened in there?
Like, it didn't take very long.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.350
I got what I came for.

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:26.690
want to meet me for a drink later?
Purely social.

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:29.182
I'd love to, you know what
I mean, but...

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.927
I just don't think it's
a very good idea.

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:34.167
-Aye, apple crumble.
-Apple crumble.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:41.032
Look, I really do have
a pretty serious girlfriend.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.611
Like, she's pregnant, and we're
living together and everything.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.605
Just thought a wee drink
would be fun.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:49.476
Here.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:05:00.518
Take this to Allan in Turf Lodge.
I told him you'd have it there by 1 :00.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.928
If you're late, he'll be
thinking you're up to something.

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:30.647
Jesus Christ!
Man, were you following me?

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.458
Look here.
They gave me this.

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:35.325
when you jumped the ladder to Grace,
a platoon started following you.

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.922
Next time, take your car.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.537
I have 12 minutes to make
it to Turf Lodge...

01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:44.265
before they think I stopped
to copy that.

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:48.468
These are prison guards at Maze.
what's this schedule? Football?

01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:50.706
I don't have time to talk.
Can we just move on?

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:52.112
Like, I've got to get out.

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:55.072
-Lara's water broke.
-what?

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:58.484
Don't worry. Her ma's taking her
to the hospital.

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:02.614
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.
Her ma took her?

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:03.420
Yeah.

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:06.421
Even mothers forgive when
it comes to grandchildren.

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:08.759
Oh, this is not good.
This is not, not good.

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:12.757
Oh, man, now I've got to drop this off
before I can get up to the hospital.

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:14.563
Look, Fergus, will you come?

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:18.834
Shit!

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:27.782
It's about time you showed up.
Are you ready to be a da?

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:01.475
Two sugars.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.609
Oh, that's perfect. Thank you.
That's brilliant.

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:12.283
Listen, Fergus, thank you
so much for coming.

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:14.262
It means so much to me.
Thank you.

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:19.286
I'm telling you, it's just...

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:21.531
Really, it has just been amazing,
you know?

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:25.028
Yeah. I remember the day
my Johnny was born.

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:28.202
Yeah, it's quite something.

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:32.009
we don't see too much
of each other now.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.682
Casualty of the business.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.744
we've already moved the officers
off that list...

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:42.847
but don't worry, we've relocated
all the officers at the prison...

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:45.324
making it look routine.
You're covered.

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:46.458
Okay, yeah.

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:48.221
Hey.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.821
Oh, okay.

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:54.267
well, we have to wet the baby's head.

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.634
Yes, we do. we absolutely do.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.935
That is a very, very good plan.

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.837
I've got a few plans up me sleeve.

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.645
God, I need that.

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:09.875
-what's his name?
-He's Patrick. wee Patrick.

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:11.781
-Patrick.
-Aye.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:19.250
well... cheers, Patrick.
You've got one hell of a father.

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.694
So does Johnny.

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:28.395
-Hey, Marty!
-Jeez, Sean!

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:29.904
Marty!

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.533
-Sean, what are you doing?
-How you doing man?

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:35.075
-Check it out. I'm a da!
-who the fuck is that?

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:39.243
He's just some happy uncle.
Check him out. Come on.

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.247
Look at that. Aye.

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:43.808
-what's his name?
-He's Patrick.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:47.118
Patrick. He's got lovely eyes,
just like mine.

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:51.586
-Oh, and what are these?
-They're fucking shoes.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.527
well, they're... they're lovely.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:12.576
But roughly a third of the consignment
was intercepted by the police.

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:14.171
The device was primed
and booby-trapped.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.343
A police found it when he spotted
something suspicious in the...

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:19.011
A bomb factory equipped
for a sustained campaign of terror...

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.622
A hundred guns were discovered
by the police in one of the biggest...

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:22.987
Come on, hand it over!

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:41.836
I didn't hear you come in.

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:44.810
Obviously.

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:47.545
It's not what it seems, okay?

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:51.117
Don't bullshit me.
You think I don't know what you do?

01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:54.652
It's just for a few days.
That's it.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.456
It's the RA, and if not them,
the peelers.

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.791
Between the two, you'll end up
either dead or in jail...

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:01.920
and then what about us?

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:06.595
what do you mean,
"what about us?"

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:09.227
I'm just saying it's just
for a few days. That's all it is.

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:16.273
You're going to have to decide, Martin,
because we're not waiting around...

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:19.212
for the call that they've found you in
a ditch with a bullet hole in the head.

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:26.416
Thank you.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:38.256
So what, we've got to go to Scotland?
Like, for how long?

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.827
Three days. Grace is checking
out a Libyan shipment of weapons.

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:42.995
we're her security.

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:45.235
So we're meeting a Libyan gun dealer?

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:48.009
How do we know if they're Libyans,
anyway?

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:50.908
-How do we pick them out from the crowd?
-Usually they shave their heads.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.278
-what, they're bald?
-And they're probably eating couscous.

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:54.247
That's not true.

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:56.511
It's a fact. You don't even know
what couscous is.

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.576
It's a curry that's got
all sorts of shit on it.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.452
-who, the Libyans do?
-Aye, they do.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.019
That's disgusting.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:04.821
It's disgusting.
They've got awful breath, they do.

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:06.485
-ls that true?
-It's a fact.

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:15.325
Mickey said that?

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:20.438
He actually said he wanted me to take
over the entire operation on me own?

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.044
-You're ready.
-Jeez...

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:29.178
what about Sean?

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:37.054
Okay, fair point.
Fair point.

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:40.218
They keep not making me say it.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:44.562
Did you have something to do with this?
Did you speak to Mickey?

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:48.029
Maybe a wee bit.

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:50.995
well, thank you for doing that.

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:53.939
It wasn't my decision, though.
It was his choice.

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:56.304
well, thank you, if you did.

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:00.535
This is just mad.

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:03.107
Like, I've never even been out
of lreland before, and now all this.

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:06.283
-I know. I can tell.
-Oh, you can tell?

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:08.785
It's cute.

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.619
Oh, great. Now I'm cute.

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:15.657
Don't be so sensitive.
Cute can be... a very good thing.

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:21.566
-well, then I'm sensitive.
-And cute.

01:12:34.483 --> 01:12:36.974
Look, Grace, I'm sorry.
I just can't do that.

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.694
You turned her down, didn't you?

01:12:58.107 --> 01:12:59.506
Mickey's good boy.

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:10.618
Sainthood.
Is that what you're going for?

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:26.959
It's going to be a fine trip.

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:29.730
Sean! Are you coming
to Scotland or what?

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.368
Come on, man.

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:44.582
I'm hearing whispers Ml5 are going
to step in and poach your star boy.

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:50.581
He's a damn fine bargaining chip.
You could jump a few rooms.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:53.224
Do you know what the word
"collusion" means?

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:56.729
Although, it does have a certain
romantic ring to it...

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:59.168
but as words go, it's extremely
overrated.

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:01.864
It means we're doing the dirty work
while those brave souls in London...

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.200
fight a battle from their
fucking drawing rooms.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:08.769
I'm telling you, I like it here.
It's, like, peaceful. It's nice.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:12.508
Look around, right? There's not one
chopper overhead, nothing.

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:13.239
It's nice.

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:17.147
I guess you're nesting. Come on.
we're late.

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:20.085
I'm just letting you know, you're
not going in on your own, okay?

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:21.280
I'll do what I need to do.

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:31.187
Grace, good to see you.
Apologies about the cold boys, eh?

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.259
So why are you wearing
that naff jumper then?

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:35.602
what the fuck is wrong with you?

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:37.302
Bastard!

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:41.474
I told you no guns.

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:43.306
Are we going to do
this deal, or what?

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:49.279
Grace, you're not going in
on your own, okay?

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.761
For fuck's sake.

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:08.728
I'll be looking into you.
You can count on it.

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:10.797
Lara?

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:13.299
Lara?

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.992
-ls she here?
-Three days and nights you disappear?

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:36.587
I know, I know. Look, can I just
speak to her, Mrs. Flaherty, please?

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:37.495
Oh, shame on you!

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.057
I just need to speak to her
for just a wee second!

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:41.226
-Keep away from her...
-Lara! Lara, are you in there?

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:44.305
-No, please, I was snagged by the RUC!
-Oh, yes, that's a good one!

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:46.136
They wouldn't let me near a telephone!

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:48.709
I swear, Lara, they wouldn't
let me near a telephone!

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:50.505
There was nothing I could do!

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:53.706
If I could have spoken to you, I would!
Come on, please!

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:57.184
will you just come to the window, Lara?
Please, I just want to see your face!

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:58.685
Please, Lara!

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:00.084
Fuck...

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:02.348
Lara, please.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.462
I'm so sorry.
Lara, I'm sorry.

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:14.567
I'm sorry.

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.903
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:23.138
I'm sorry.

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:28.479
I love you, okay?
Look, look, I love you.

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:32.450
Look at me, please. Look at me.
Please, Lara, look at me.

01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:36.846
I love you. I do.
Do you love me?

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:42.897
I thought you were dead!

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:47.394
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.140
Come here.

01:17:05.487 --> 01:17:07.045
That's it, eh?
Come here.

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:14.219
I'm taking you to Scotland, that's it.
I'm just going to take you and leave.

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:16.321
we're going to get away from
all this political shit.

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:21.063
You're never going to leave the lRA.

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:24.834
Oh, no? I'll do whatever you want me
to do at this point. I'm yours.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:30.078
Because you're captured by the anarchy
of it all, like the rest of them.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:31.943
And you love it.

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:38.109
So we're going to hit the pub afterwards,
courtesy of the Libyan government.

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:40.177
Don't go AwOL again.
It's not healthy.

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.952
I am in charge
of this entire operation.

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:45.883
Anyway, look, I've got to get back.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:48.258
Like, Lara's not exactly
buying my excuses anymore.

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:50.856
Yeah, I was married to a nice girl once.
She hung in there until l...

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:53.400
until I tried
the alien abduction excuse.

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.960
what's this, the "take care
of your family" speech?

01:17:56.104 --> 01:17:58.800
Hey, you're so young, Martin,
you make me envious.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.435
Life's full of mistakes. I lost
my family making all the obvious ones.

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.676
There, that was your speech.

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:07.906
Aye, very moving.

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:12.180
what are you saying? Are you saying
that I should quit? Is that it?

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.484
-we've had a good run.
-Aye, yeah, we have.

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:20.257
Look, there's going to be a drop.
It's on Thursday night, on the docks.

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:23.491
My mate's wee brother's going to be
there. Don't worry about him.

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:26.920
He doesn't know anything.
He's just going to be there, all right?

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:30.426
So leave him alone.
Go in, get the guns, and then get out.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.268
Okay. This is it.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:35.865
what the fuck's going on?

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.003
Get down on the ground!

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:38.842
what's going on?

01:18:39.414 --> 01:18:42.212
Ah, Jesus Christ.
Marty, they're Brits.

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:49.123
Get it started. Get the fuck out
of here, come on.

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.755
what the fuck was that all about?

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:06.273
You said I'd save lives, right,
and that includes my people...

01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:07.365
you Brit bastard!

01:19:07.442 --> 01:19:10.070
It's a set-up for a bigger fish.
It was out of my hands.

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:12.146
It's big boys' rules
you're playing here!

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.511
"Big boys' rules," is that it, right?

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:15.583
You're going to hide behind
"big boys' rules"?

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.709
Okay, well, how about this?
Like, "Yes, sir,"' huh?

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:20.845
"Consider it done, sir!
He's just another statistic, sir!

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.549
It didn't even happen, sir!"

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:24.252
Right?

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.288
You think that shit is going
to change the fact that you...

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:32.357
yeah, you... you killed an 18-year
old fellow who didn't know any better?

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:35.195
And you're innocent?

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:39.471
You and your mates are volunteers
in a volunteer organization.

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:43.502
who's making any one of you do anything
you don't want to do?

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:45.445
where does that leave you
and your mates?

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:48.941
Aye... Aye, my mates.

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.953
That's exactly what they are,
they're my mates.

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.513
You know, I know his ma.
All right, do you understand that?

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:56.819
Is that getting through?
I know this guy's ma...

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:58.415
and I know his brothers!

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.894
I told you what I know so you could
save his arse, huh?

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:06.498
But no, he's just another paddy
to you and your big boys, isn't he?

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:09.798
You know what? Get the fuck out
of my country.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.410
we all know
the lRA aren't terrorists.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:24.349
The lRA are freedom fighters.

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:30.522
Rise up for our help, oh, Lord!

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:34.152
Strike down our enemies before us.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:39.267
An eyewitness maintains one of
the men pleaded for his life...

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:40.768
before he was shot.

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:44.063
This brings to eight the number
of IRA members...

01:20:44.105 --> 01:20:46.437
who have been killed
in the last three months.

01:20:58.753 --> 01:21:01.221
Right, stop here.
Right, remember, lads...

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:04.417
single shots to head and the body.
No fucking around, okay?

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:05.390
Away you go.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.463
-well, how's the kid?
-He's grown.

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:19.129
-They tend to do that.
-Yeah.

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.642
-Fuck it!
-well?

01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:32.653
-The fucker wouldn't go down.
-Drive.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.322
-This wee girl was watching.
-Huh?

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.925
we were wearing the balaclavas, for
Christ's sake. She wouldn't make us.

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.394
Right. Here, get them shirts off.

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:46.357
I want you to take the car up
to Hightown Road. Burn it, okay?

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:50.429
-Did we actually get what we came for?
-Saturday, 28th of March.

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.998
At least something went fucking right.

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:19.159
I've not really been sleeping.

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:22.668
That's why God invented sleeping pills.

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:25.230
I take it you've reconsidered?

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:30.111
-The hit on Park Street was...
-Ray?

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:37.483
Aye, and Johnny. And a wee girl
saw the whole fucking thing.

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:38.813
Yeah. Seven years old.

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:43.279
She was right next to her daddy.
Got covered in his blood, I'm told.

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:45.253
I've got a son...

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:48.456
and there's nobody deserves to grow up
with that picture in their mind.

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:53.494
Fergus, they didn't give me any
warning about this one.

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.592
I'm starting to, you know,
think that they're onto me.

01:22:58.139 --> 01:23:00.266
You wouldn't be here if they
were onto you.

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.308
I've not got a good feeling about it.

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:06.212
-My car's definitely marked, right?
-Yeah, of course.

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:09.375
Go home.
Hug your wife and baby.

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:21.251
The pub job's going on the 28th.
That's all I've got.

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:25.757
well, you did well.

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:30.967
Aye.

01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:42.012
Make sure you check the timer.

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.443
That way it doesn't blow up
in your face.

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:47.550
It's going to blow up
the whole city, man.

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:52.417
It seems like whenever
you're around, nothing blows up.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.360
You want
to shut the door for me?

01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:03.195
Yeah, you give it a good kick.
Good man.

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.206
There you go.

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:08.403
what'd we get Mummy?
we've got fish and chips, didn't we?

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:11.445
Straight out the deep fat
fryer, we caught this, me and Patrick.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.143
All right, let's get some food.

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:19.820
Your friends Mickey and Grace
dropped by.

01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:25.687
They went on about the new house,
the fridge, the cooker.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:29.195
They were extremely interested
in the new TV.

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:32.765
It's fine. Honestly, I think
it's nothing.

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:35.962
-They trust me. It's fine.
-we have a child, Martin.

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:40.663
For his sake, I'd leave,
but I'm pregnant.

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:44.811
where am I going to go?

01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:49.876
Look, let's get married.
I want to get married. Do you?

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:51.748
I do. Let's get married, please?
Come on.

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:53.514
-why?
-why get married?

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:56.489
what do you mean, "why?"
Because I love you, that's why.

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:58.553
Love?

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:04.057
Every time you leave, I wonder if
it's the last time I'll see you alive.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:05.191
I have nightmares!

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:08.361
The neighbours are afraid of you,
and you wear that like a medal.

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:11.133
I heard you were palling with
the RA nutters!

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:13.697
Are you? Are you?

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:18.737
what exactly does the daddy
of our wee boy do for "the cause"?

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:44.202
Marty, see you for
a couple minutes, son?

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:46.967
-Mickey...
-Marty will debrief you later.

01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:58.274
Looks like we're all set.

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:02.181
Here's a present.
It's from Mickey.

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:06.552
He wants you to keep it close by.
You know how he worries.

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:10.121
Aye. This is going to make you famous.

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:15.293
By the way, it's only me
and you know the exact location.

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:17.099
Aye.

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:47.000
Info finally confirmed.

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:51.199
Every Saturday, the prison wardens
play a football match.

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.931
Locations are kept top secret.

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:58.637
Now, next Saturday, March 28th,
after the Semis...

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.578
they'll be drinking in the whale Pub.

01:27:01.649 --> 01:27:02.843
So we have a week.

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:06.544
This is the big one.
Did you give her the gun?

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:09.819
Yes. Look, tonight we do a test run.

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:12.859
we check the place out,
we finalize details. No weapons.

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:17.057
Look, if anything happens, they will
definitely know that it was me who told.

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:18.428
Go on the recce tonight.

01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:21.593
we won't do anything till next
Saturday. That's when we grab them...

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:25.099
armed and loaded, and when all the
shit goes down...

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.409
you walk into one of our
secured vehicles.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:29.637
we'll pull your family out.

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:33.539
Don't tell Lara anything.
A slip could be costly.

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:38.316
She's pregnant again.

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:46.259
Congratulations. I won't let anything
happen to you or your family.

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:53.230
Ml5 just called me.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:56.794
-Of course you told them to fuck off.
-It's done.

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:02.065
-The pub job?
-They're running it now.

01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:05.676
what about my source?

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:12.451
A good handler manages the source.
He doesn't let the source manage him.

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:14.916
He's not your source anymore.

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:22.051
It's shit like this that ends careers,
so walk away.

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:34.407
well, lads, for security purposes...

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:38.468
most of you are hearing this
for the first time, so pay attention.

01:28:39.113 --> 01:28:41.843
It's your lives that's at risk
here, okay?

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.247
Martin, it's all yours.

01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:47.354
Okay, we'll have two AKs in
the getaway car.

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.356
All right, escape routes
are on your maps.

01:28:50.591 --> 01:28:53.492
-How many rounds we got?
-About 1 89.

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:57.328
Two mags for each of the AKs.
Spares are in the getaway car.

01:28:57.765 --> 01:29:00.063
-why, do you think that's enough?
-Aye.

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:03.869
Tonight is a dry run.
we make sure our plan is good to go.

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:06.499
Next Saturday, on the 28th,
it's for real.

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:10.603
Sean, Kieran, you go in the side door.
Grace, we'll go in the front.

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:11.838
Check all exits.

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:13.106
A wee bottle of Guinness.

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:15.581
Johnny, stay with the getaway car.

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:18.408
I'll go inside, I'll keep watch on
the front door.

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:20.216
Get yourselves a drink,
do what you've got to do...

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:22.448
but don't leave any fingerprints.

01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:24.817
Keep the change.

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:13.197
Aye. Ease up, man.
For fuck's sake.

01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:21.943
You got the time?

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:26.476
Code green.
Code green.

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:43.430
Shit! You're a dead man!
You're a dead man!

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:46.872
You fucking bastard, you.

01:30:48.609 --> 01:30:49.906
You're a fucking tout!

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:53.480
You fucking bastard.
I'm going to kill you!

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:01.614
we've got you now, bitch!

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:18.502
Hello?

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:21.001
Lara? Lara, it's me.

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.939
Oh, God. Martin...

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:25.273
Listen to me.
Listen to me, okay?

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:29.179
I need you to kiss Patrick good night
for me, okay?

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:34.821
we're going to be all right.

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.781
I'm going to go to my mommy's.

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:40.192
I'm so sorry.

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:42.629
Martin?

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:44.195
Aye.

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:46.462
I got a question for you.

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:48.062
what's that?

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:51.968
will you marry me?

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:53.569
Aye.

01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:57.703
You promise?
So we're married?

01:31:58.579 --> 01:31:59.705
Yeah, we're married.

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:06.986
Great.
we are man and wife.

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:10.253
I love you.

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:17.562
I love you, too.
I love you, and I love Patrick, okay?

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:20.657
-But you've got to get out.
-what's that?

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:39.785
-So where is he?
-How the fuck do I know?

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:43.283
Under the circumstances, I think
it's a pretty fair question.

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:44.824
Did you compromise the operation?

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:47.554
Oh, so that's it, is it?
That's how this is going to go down?

01:32:47.628 --> 01:32:50.028
Ml5 step in, screw up,
and I get to eat the bullshit?

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.934
It's a big picture thing.

01:32:57.705 --> 01:32:59.866
It was supposed to be an easy bait
and switch...

01:33:00.374 --> 01:33:02.296
and your boy shouldn't have
walked out of there but he did...

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.175
and now there's a mess to clean up.

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:10.675
Don't be forgetting,
you're one of the good guys.

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.983
-A man of the law.
-Since when?

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:18.720
Since when did this
become about the law?

01:33:58.165 --> 01:33:59.723
what the hell happened to you?

01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:02.701
Me and Lara had a fight.

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:05.268
Oh, Marty...

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:09.537
Ma, no.

01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:12.303
Hello?

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:13.641
Hello, is Martin there?

01:34:13.714 --> 01:34:15.306
No, I haven't seen him.

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:17.247
-Tell him it's Fergus calling.
-Fergus?

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:18.978
Give me the phone.

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:21.380
You set me up, man,
you lying bastard!

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:23.685
Look, it had nothing to do with me.
I'll be there in 20.

01:34:23.724 --> 01:34:25.191
I'm your only chance now.

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:30.657
-Marty, what's going on?
-It's fine, Ma.

01:34:30.731 --> 01:34:32.426
-T ell me!
-Listen, it's all right.

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:38.900
He's a tout, Mrs. McGartland.

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:42.931
There's no way that's true.
Marty?

01:34:48.949 --> 01:34:51.645
The Special Branch
don't want him anymore.

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.612
-Connie!
-Connie, no!

01:34:55.956 --> 01:34:57.719
No! No!

01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:59.956
If you leave them, look,
I'll go with you.

01:35:00.027 --> 01:35:02.222
Okay, you leave my family, please.

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:05.321
Ma... Ma, listen to me.
I'll be fine.

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:07.833
I'll be back in two hours.
Okay? Two hours.

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.329
Let go of me!
Let go of me!

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:13.134
Get off him!
Get off him!

01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:15.634
Oh, Ma...

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:17.307
Are you all right?

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:19.338
Christ.

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:21.644
Oh, Christ!

01:35:30.991 --> 01:35:31.753
Yeah.

01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:36.928
Jesus. Fine.
we're not going anywhere.

01:35:36.997 --> 01:35:38.294
I'm just getting a bath.

01:35:42.336 --> 01:35:44.304
They won't be here for another hour.

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:56.013
If it was up to me, you wouldn't
be seeing the end of that hour.

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:06.548
Piece of shit.
Get his feet. Come on.

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:17.237
Oh, shit. Ow, fuck!

01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:22.670
where's Martin, then?

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:27.110
You going
to let them kill your mate?

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:28.982
He's not my mate.

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:31.118
You ever wonder why you're
not behind bars...

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:33.746
when we've been all over you
for the past two years?

01:36:34.955 --> 01:36:36.286
Your mate, Martin.

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:44.354
I hear the Special Branch
have lost interest in you.

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:47.457
well, then, that makes me unofficial.

01:36:47.902 --> 01:36:49.927
New rules.
You get to live if he lives.

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:55.941
Broom Park.

01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:59.075
Broom Park,
you fucking bastard!

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:18.890
Yeah, this is a message
from John Smith, IRA.

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:22.196
There's a bomb.
A lot of Samaritans will die.

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:23.133
Broom Park.

01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:24.430
what is the password?

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:25.835
Carry Gold.

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:31.702
what do you have?

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:34.014
we need to be able to question him.
Bring him in here.

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:34.844
Come on.

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:38.677
Over there.

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:57.401
Fucking peelers like flies on shit.

01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:06.038
You going to tell me what you did?

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:32.229
I'm pretty sure the lRA is holding
my top boy somewhere in there.

01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:34.136
Funny coincidence, that we're looking
for a bomb...

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:36.165
in the same place that
your source is being held.

01:38:36.243 --> 01:38:36.971
Thomas...

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:39.910
Oh, great delay tactic. Pretty
much locked the place down.

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:41.377
Move out!

01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:43.382
Come on, man, who are you
taking orders from?

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:45.947
Look, I'm just trying to make it
to retirement.

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:47.544
Oh, fuck it, then. Fuck it.

01:38:47.688 --> 01:38:49.019
Some stunt.

01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:49.987
Move out!

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:03.469
Fuck, come on!

01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:18.747
You're going to talk, Marty,
you know that.

01:39:20.854 --> 01:39:22.014
You know that?

01:39:26.694 --> 01:39:28.457
Keep it shut right now, right?

01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:30.527
Get it.

01:39:36.971 --> 01:39:39.439
-what are you doing here?
-He was my mate.

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:41.997
-You're not authorized, Sean...
-I want to hear him fucking say it!

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.737
-Sean, you're not authorized...
-Say it!

01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:46.313
Get out, Sean!
This is an army order.

01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:48.577
I'm your senior officer.
Get out!

01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:51.211
Sean, are you deaf?
Get out!

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:54.720
You'll bring the peelers to the fucking
door if you're not careful...

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:57.086
Shut up! I want to fucking
hear him say it!

01:39:57.157 --> 01:39:58.055
Hey!

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:11.331
Get an ambulance, now!

01:40:20.647 --> 01:40:22.877
He's a peeler.
we have no orders for this.

01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:36.893
Jesus Christ.

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:41.127
Okay, what happened?

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:49.507
Get him back.

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:14.362
-Take him to City Hospital.
-The Royal's closer.

01:41:14.401 --> 01:41:17.029
He won't live if we take him there.
Take him to the City.

01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:21.340
Get alongside him.
Get alongside him!

01:41:40.094 --> 01:41:42.289
Right up Jackson Street!
Jackson Street!

01:41:54.108 --> 01:41:55.405
Keep going and ram him.

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:14.624
Fuck him!

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:24.631
Shit! Shit!

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:30.169
watch the door!

01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:40.314
So, Robbie, I hear the shit's
going down at Special Branch?

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.255
Bloody hell.
what is the matter with you?

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:48.393
why is the kid still breathing?
was it not a simple request?

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.386
If it was, you'd have done
it yourselves.

01:42:50.464 --> 01:42:51.863
-Fuck off.
-You asked.

01:42:53.433 --> 01:42:54.866
Yeah, well, clean it up.

01:43:06.613 --> 01:43:09.707
If the RUC don't protect him,
Ml5 will leave him exposed...

01:43:09.816 --> 01:43:10.976
a gift to the lRA...

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:13.953
a bait and switch to deflect
attention from a plant higher up.

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:16.285
-what's your stake in this?
-He was my operative.

01:43:17.824 --> 01:43:18.722
Shit...

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:22.491
Look, there's no way I can get
involved in this, for fuck's sake.

01:43:22.529 --> 01:43:25.498
well, how about I go to the press,
and we debate this in public?

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:27.725
You won't live long enough
to do that, and you know it.

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:31.237
Martin. That's his name.
Martin.

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:39.502
He saved, I'd guess, 50 soldiers,
RUC officers, prison wardens.

01:43:39.546 --> 01:43:42.435
Ml5 turns him into a bargaining chip.
He has a girlfriend...

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:44.279
a son, and another baby on the way.

01:43:47.988 --> 01:43:48.784
Look...

01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:52.987
we uphold the law and break
the law in the name of the law.

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:53.993
Is that why you signed up?

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:57.326
There isn't a day goes by when I don't
fulfil my oath to serve this community.

01:43:57.397 --> 01:43:58.421
I know.

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:02.066
Shit... why me?

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:45.502
You f...
You fuck...

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:55.446
-where's Lara and the boy?
-They're at her mum's.

01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:02.257
How long have I been out?

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:05.755
Long enough for
the dust to settle.

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:11.866
You deserted me.

01:45:15.075 --> 01:45:17.908
well, like it or not,
I'm your only friend right now.

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:22.809
My real name's Dean.

01:45:24.384 --> 01:45:27.785
But you can keep calling me Fergus.
The name's grown on me.

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:31.916
Is he okay?

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:35.893
He's okay, yeah.

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:43.429
-His wife's here to see him.
-He hasn't got a wife.

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:47.371
-where's the RUC officer?
-I don't know where he is.

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:48.635
Did you tell her what room he's in?

01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:55.504
This is against my orders.

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:57.082
well, he won't last the night
if he stops here.

01:45:57.617 --> 01:46:01.109
He has a deep internal cut,
a fractured jaw, a severe concussion...

01:46:01.154 --> 01:46:02.553
and several broken ribs.

01:46:02.622 --> 01:46:04.487
Just pray this
is a nine-lives situation.

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:42.391
So this is pretty cozy
for a safe house.

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:44.322
It's my house.

01:46:58.211 --> 01:47:02.875
So, Dean,
I hope you have a plan.

01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:06.416
well, Lara still doesn't
know you're alive.

01:47:07.754 --> 01:47:10.382
I've negotiated a deal
with Scotland Yard.

01:47:16.596 --> 01:47:17.563
Call Lara.

01:47:18.432 --> 01:47:20.832
See if she'll like the idea
of getting married in Scotland.

01:47:25.872 --> 01:47:28.500
You know, you look me in the eye,
okay...

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:31.972
and you tell me what kind
of life you think she'd have.

01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.148
No hope, no friends, no community.

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:39.783
Always looking over our shoulder,
scared to death for them kids.

01:47:42.289 --> 01:47:43.517
I can't do it.

01:47:45.725 --> 01:47:47.556
I really can't do it.
I won't do it.

01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:03.871
You know, I thought
I was saving lives.

01:48:05.111 --> 01:48:06.738
A superhero.

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:34.399
Do you ever see your kid?

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:38.000
He's... he's got a lot going on
right now.

01:49:01.134 --> 01:49:02.658
Okay, let's go.

01:49:26.459 --> 01:49:28.791
Oh, my God.
Help...

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:30.791
Help!

01:49:31.565 --> 01:49:32.759
Call an ambulance!

01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:38.067
Stay awake.
Help is coming.

01:49:38.171 --> 01:49:40.639
Do you have family?
who should I call?

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:44.672
Dean. Dean McTear.
Dean McTear.

01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:49.972
-He's family?
-Yeah. Dean McTear.
