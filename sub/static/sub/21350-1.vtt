00:16.788 --> 00:18.756
Oh hey, look, desert.

00:18.758 --> 00:20.224
And more desert.

00:22.027 --> 00:24.495
The, 10 meters up on the right.

00:24.497 --> 00:25.429
Here come left.

00:25.431 --> 00:27.631
Coming left.

00:29.467 --> 00:31.168
Fuck, there's another one!

00:31.170 --> 00:32.136
Come right, come right!

00:54.660 --> 00:56.093
Almost lost one!

00:57.396 --> 00:58.429
Look, look, look, look, look, look!

00:58.431 --> 01:01.065
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,.

01:18.183 --> 01:19.149
Whoo!

01:23.054 --> 01:24.655
Woo!

01:24.657 --> 01:25.622
Woo!

03:20.672 --> 03:22.506
I say they walk the plank.

03:22.508 --> 03:23.707
They walk the plank.

03:23.709 --> 03:25.976
Walk the plank to the lake!

03:25.978 --> 03:27.110
To the lake!

03:29.981 --> 03:31.615
Ah!

03:31.617 --> 03:32.583
Ah!

03:41.025 --> 03:42.626
Boom, boom!

03:52.537 --> 03:53.503
Get him in the lake.

03:53.505 --> 03:54.471
Don't worry, I won't do it.

03:54.473 --> 03:55.739
Get him in there!

03:55.741 --> 03:56.573
Whoa!

04:34.546 --> 04:35.379
I win!

04:35.381 --> 04:36.980
Boom!

04:36.982 --> 04:38.582
Come on, old man!

04:38.584 --> 04:40.517
You're sleeping in the cave tonight!

04:40.519 --> 04:41.351
Come on

04:59.437 --> 05:00.771
Almost there.

05:00.773 --> 05:01.605
Come on.

05:17.256 --> 05:18.488
Oh god.

05:18.490 --> 05:20.023
Oh, you crampin' up them muscles?

05:21.727 --> 05:23.126
Not a god damn fish!

05:23.128 --> 05:24.294
Clearly.

05:24.296 --> 05:26.129
What stroke was that?

05:26.131 --> 05:27.898
It's the black stroke, you little bastard.

05:27.900 --> 05:28.732
Huh?

05:28.734 --> 05:30.200
Get over here.

05:30.202 --> 05:31.468
Alright, alright, alright.

05:31.470 --> 05:32.736
Too much suction, too much suction!

05:34.106 --> 05:34.971
Little Jack Johnson, huh?

05:34.973 --> 05:35.806
That better?

05:35.808 --> 05:36.640
Yes.

05:36.642 --> 05:37.474
Yeah.

05:37.476 --> 05:38.408
Much better.

05:44.148 --> 05:46.249
I just didn't realize it was a shared plan.

05:46.251 --> 05:47.551
I mean we've been talking about it

05:47.553 --> 05:50.954
for like a couple of months now.

05:50.956 --> 05:52.589
Then we'll do the surgeries,

05:52.591 --> 05:54.391
and then I'll do his pt.

05:54.393 --> 05:56.026
Sounds fantastic.

05:56.028 --> 05:57.294
Yeah, I mean you know,

05:57.296 --> 05:58.829
we'll probably have to start out small,

05:58.831 --> 06:01.531
but eventually we want to
do professional athletes,

06:01.533 --> 06:03.867
and police and firefighters, you know?

06:03.869 --> 06:05.669
Well it sounds like a solid plan to me,

06:05.671 --> 06:06.870
Mr. 1,500.

06:06.872 --> 06:09.840
Ooh, that's Mr. 1,520, to you.

06:09.842 --> 06:11.475
Tim got the 1,500.

06:12.477 --> 06:14.511
I have to measure 1,520.

06:14.513 --> 06:15.746
Hey.

06:15.748 --> 06:16.980
Remember that time you were jealous

06:16.982 --> 06:19.716
'cause your sat score was lower than mine?

06:19.718 --> 06:20.784
Fuck you.

06:24.455 --> 06:28.258
Hey, I ever show you guys a campfire bomb?

06:29.961 --> 06:30.927
No.

06:31.729 --> 06:33.029
No, no thanks.

06:33.965 --> 06:35.599
One, two, three!

06:41.006 --> 06:41.906
Fire!

06:43.775 --> 06:46.543
Now I can roast my marshmallow.

06:47.846 --> 06:48.879
Where you go?

06:48.881 --> 06:49.713
Ben!

06:49.715 --> 06:50.547
Tim!

06:50.549 --> 06:52.315
Where you at?

07:03.694 --> 07:05.195
I watched it fly right

07:05.197 --> 07:06.696
into the world trade center.

07:06.698 --> 07:09.466
And it was flying really low
and going incredibly fast.

07:09.468 --> 07:11.268
I could hear the engine.

07:11.270 --> 07:12.869
I've never seen anything like this.

07:12.871 --> 07:17.174
It just plants this side of the building.

07:28.152 --> 07:29.386
Ben, what's up?

07:29.388 --> 07:30.353
Something's wrong, I need to talk to Tim.

07:30.355 --> 07:31.188
What's going on?

07:31.190 --> 07:32.689
Turn on the TV.

07:32.691 --> 07:34.057
You'll see there's been like
an accident, or something.

07:34.059 --> 07:38.028
Tim, can you come out
in the hallway please?

07:42.767 --> 07:43.700
What's up, man?

07:43.702 --> 07:45.202
Where's your dad today?

07:45.204 --> 07:47.370
Um, I don't know.

07:47.372 --> 07:48.605
What's today?

07:49.507 --> 07:51.708
Today's Tuesday.

07:51.710 --> 07:53.810
He just flipped it so he
wouldn't miss any of my games.

07:53.812 --> 07:55.979
So Tuesdays and Thursdays he's in the city.

07:55.981 --> 07:56.947
Why?

07:58.249 --> 08:00.684
Crashed into the world trade center.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.054
Apparently there is very
little information available,

08:04.056 --> 08:06.022
but we do have Kelly Bolicky on the phone

08:06.024 --> 08:07.891
who saw the events unfold.

08:07.893 --> 08:09.092
Kelly, can you hear me?

08:09.094 --> 08:10.560
Hey which, which tower is that?

08:10.562 --> 08:11.795
Shock right now, but I came out

08:11.797 --> 08:13.163
Ben man, which one is that?

08:13.165 --> 08:15.065
And I heard this explosion.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.399
Then people started...

08:16.401 --> 08:17.634
No!

08:17.636 --> 08:18.435
You okay right now

08:18.437 --> 08:19.603
No!

08:55.239 --> 08:56.306
Mom! Mom!

08:58.476 --> 08:59.442
Mom!

09:00.311 --> 09:01.111
Hey!

09:01.113 --> 09:01.945
Where are you?

09:08.886 --> 09:10.520
No, no, no, don't, don't.

09:11.423 --> 09:13.557
Hey, guys.

09:16.460 --> 09:20.030
This just isn't supposed
to be the way it happens.

09:20.032 --> 09:22.432
There's just so much that I never got to...

09:22.434 --> 09:23.800
when I tried going down the stairs,

09:23.802 --> 09:26.269
but there wasn't any stairs.

09:27.605 --> 09:31.908
Tim, there's so much that
I never got to teach you.

09:33.411 --> 09:35.712
That I never got to show you.

09:35.714 --> 09:38.782
Know that I'm proud of you.

09:38.784 --> 09:40.016
So proud of you.

09:40.018 --> 09:43.219
Son, you'll make a great man, one day.

09:43.221 --> 09:45.121
Sweetheart, Annie, I'm so sorry.

10:34.039 --> 10:36.272
I can graduate early, if I want.

10:36.274 --> 10:39.676
At least, that's what Ms. Henshaw said.

10:48.686 --> 10:49.986
14-5.

10:49.988 --> 10:50.954
I'm up.

10:52.123 --> 10:56.159
If I do that, I can enlist by February.

10:56.161 --> 10:57.727
What about basketball?

10:57.729 --> 10:59.763
And prom, and college?

11:00.765 --> 11:03.566
None of that shit matters, man.

11:13.544 --> 11:15.245
Let's do it, man.

11:15.247 --> 11:16.713
Fuck this place.

11:18.516 --> 11:19.349
Wait, really?

11:19.351 --> 11:20.316
Yeah.

11:21.552 --> 11:23.119
What about your med school?

11:23.121 --> 11:24.421
I'll be a medic.

11:24.423 --> 11:26.256
There's always gonna be sick people, right?

11:26.258 --> 11:28.024
They'll be here when we get back.

11:29.261 --> 11:30.260
We'll go in for a couple of years!

11:30.262 --> 11:31.327
Win the war!

11:31.329 --> 11:32.796
Kick some fucking ass!

11:32.798 --> 11:34.564
Not like we're gonna miss
anything here, anyways.

11:34.566 --> 11:36.299
We're gonna miss the apple festival.

11:39.904 --> 11:43.440
Dude, I don't even like apples.

11:43.442 --> 11:44.407
Hurt my teeth.

11:46.378 --> 11:47.343
Hook shot!

11:48.646 --> 11:49.479
Come on!

11:49.481 --> 11:50.947
Oh!

12:10.569 --> 12:13.069
Alright, you get it now.

12:13.071 --> 12:14.003
Get that now.

12:14.005 --> 12:14.871
Huh, you ticklish?

12:14.873 --> 12:16.473
Yeah, yeah?

12:16.475 --> 12:17.440
Dinner!

12:20.912 --> 12:22.378
Shh, shh, shh.

12:28.452 --> 12:31.020
You know what, you know what?

12:33.725 --> 12:34.858
Here we go.

12:42.566 --> 12:43.600
Dinnertime.

12:46.937 --> 12:48.104
Here you go, sweetie.

12:48.106 --> 12:49.072
Got it?

12:51.509 --> 12:53.276
Is that enough to start?

12:53.278 --> 12:54.577
It's good.

12:54.579 --> 12:57.547
Why don't you help yourself to that?

12:57.549 --> 12:58.982
What's for dinner?

12:58.984 --> 13:01.885
It's called whisky fish.

13:01.887 --> 13:05.688
I ran out of white wine, so I used whisky.

13:05.690 --> 13:06.523
It's good.

13:06.525 --> 13:07.357
Try it.

13:07.359 --> 13:08.424
It'll be good.

13:08.426 --> 13:09.826
Take some rice.

13:14.865 --> 13:18.201
What are you thinkin' about, Ben?

13:18.203 --> 13:19.335
Benny?

13:19.337 --> 13:21.070
What you thinkin' about?

13:21.072 --> 13:22.672
Nothin'.

13:22.674 --> 13:23.807
A-1 today.

13:25.075 --> 13:26.142
No, 7-16.

13:27.077 --> 13:29.879
Well, better than usual.

13:29.881 --> 13:30.847
Yeah.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.888
And how long do we have to do that for?

13:38.890 --> 13:40.557
Tim, we haven't seen her for four months.

13:40.559 --> 13:43.426
I'm just asking for one night of your time.

13:43.428 --> 13:46.396
I know, but can't she come here?

13:47.832 --> 13:49.699
Why, what's the problem?

13:49.701 --> 13:52.902
Well, for starters, the whole
place smells like mothballs.

13:52.904 --> 13:55.572
Mom, they're in her pantry.

13:55.574 --> 13:57.307
It is a little disgusting.

13:57.309 --> 13:59.042
They're in the refrigerator.

13:59.044 --> 14:00.643
They are not.

14:00.645 --> 14:02.145
Yes they are.

14:02.147 --> 14:04.514
They roll around inside the
door when you open it.

14:04.516 --> 14:07.817
I swear to...

14:09.753 --> 14:10.954
what's wrong?

14:27.404 --> 14:28.705
It's okay, leave it.

14:28.707 --> 14:29.672
Leave it.

14:39.049 --> 14:39.949
Yeah.

14:39.951 --> 14:41.451
We both were.

14:41.453 --> 14:42.619
Infantry?

14:42.621 --> 14:44.754
Yeah, I was hoping to be a medic.

14:44.756 --> 14:46.723
Okay, couple things.

14:48.259 --> 14:50.326
We don't have medics.

14:50.328 --> 14:51.561
Navy gives us corpsman.

14:51.563 --> 14:54.063
Guys, you can do anything you want.

14:54.065 --> 14:57.433
You could be NBC specialists,
intelligence specialists,

14:57.435 --> 14:59.802
helicopter pilots.

14:59.804 --> 15:02.805
No, the infantry is what we want.

15:05.042 --> 15:06.009
Okay.

15:06.977 --> 15:09.345
I'll work with you guys.

15:09.347 --> 15:11.981
There's something called a buddy program.

15:11.983 --> 15:13.583
You'll both go to boot together,

15:13.585 --> 15:15.652
that's all I can guarantee ya.

15:15.654 --> 15:17.820
From there, your best bet's to go infantry.

15:17.822 --> 15:19.222
Excel.

15:19.224 --> 15:20.723
Try out for recon.

15:20.725 --> 15:23.159
You want to be the tip of the
spear, that's how you do it.

15:23.161 --> 15:26.963
You will deploy, and you
will kill bad guys.

15:29.066 --> 15:31.167
Nope, absolutely not.

15:31.169 --> 15:32.001
No.

15:32.003 --> 15:33.236
Why?

15:33.238 --> 15:34.037
Ugh, okay I got the whites in the

15:34.039 --> 15:34.971
you have to sign this.

15:34.973 --> 15:36.172
I'm not signing anything.

15:36.174 --> 15:38.241
Josh is asleep, okay?

15:40.044 --> 15:41.978
Now what's going on?

15:41.980 --> 15:43.746
Ask your son.

15:43.748 --> 15:44.580
My son?

15:44.582 --> 15:46.149
Yeah, your son.

15:47.451 --> 15:48.918
Ben?

15:48.920 --> 15:52.655
I'm 17, so I need parental
permission to join the marines.

15:53.457 --> 15:54.891
Okay.

15:54.893 --> 15:57.894
Guys, I've been talking about
this since like September.

15:57.896 --> 15:59.295
What brought this on?

15:59.297 --> 16:00.964
We went to the recruiter's office today.

16:00.966 --> 16:02.432
You went to the recruiters today?

16:02.434 --> 16:04.567
Why do you keep asking
me the same questions

16:04.569 --> 16:06.035
just over and over again?

16:06.037 --> 16:07.170
It's not gonna change my answer.

16:07.172 --> 16:10.373
Don't talk to us like that.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.475
Yes, I went to the
recruiter's office today.

16:12.477 --> 16:13.910
Okay look, you're frustrated.

16:13.912 --> 16:14.844
I get that.

16:14.846 --> 16:16.312
You made it perfectly clear.

16:16.314 --> 16:18.848
Ben, you've gotta see this
from our perspective.

16:18.850 --> 16:21.050
And what's the problem?

16:21.052 --> 16:21.517
You went to war.

16:25.522 --> 16:28.524
Look, I just wanna be there
for my friend, okay?

16:28.526 --> 16:29.625
His dad was killed.

16:29.627 --> 16:31.060
He was fucking murdered.

16:31.062 --> 16:33.396
Watch your mouth.

16:33.398 --> 16:35.031
What's the problem?

16:35.033 --> 16:36.432
'Cause I'm willing to risk my life

16:36.434 --> 16:39.102
Sp Josh doesn't have to grow up with this?

16:39.104 --> 16:40.770
Yeah, I'm a real dirtbag.

16:40.772 --> 16:42.872
No, you're our little boy.

16:42.874 --> 16:45.108
And I'm not gonna bury you, too.

16:45.110 --> 16:47.310
You're 17 years old.

16:47.312 --> 16:48.212
17.

16:49.313 --> 16:52.482
What if something happened to you?

16:52.484 --> 16:55.184
I'm not doing this right now.

16:55.186 --> 16:56.219
What's the problem?

16:56.221 --> 16:57.420
I'm scared!

17:00.691 --> 17:02.558
You could get hurt.

17:03.827 --> 17:06.662
Or worse, you could die.

17:06.664 --> 17:08.064
Ben, you're gonna have to kill people.

17:08.066 --> 17:10.566
Do you think that's not gonna affect you?

17:10.568 --> 17:13.736
Who are you gonna become
when you watch somebody die

17:13.738 --> 17:17.006
because of something that you did?

17:17.008 --> 17:19.608
I mean we love you, buddy.

17:19.611 --> 17:21.077
Right now, you...

17:22.311 --> 17:25.548
but what if somebody else comes home?

17:27.451 --> 17:29.485
I'll be fine.

17:29.487 --> 17:30.319
What?

17:30.321 --> 17:32.622
I need to do this.

17:32.624 --> 17:34.123
I have to be there for him.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.758
I gave him my word.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.726
I know.

17:37.728 --> 17:38.694
I know.

17:41.665 --> 17:43.299
I'm gonna do it.

17:44.334 --> 17:48.838
It's just a matter of
now, or in eight months.

18:01.018 --> 18:01.984
What?

18:04.655 --> 18:07.523
This country is worth defending.

18:07.525 --> 18:09.025
Oh.

18:09.027 --> 18:11.461
That's what he's doing, huh?

18:11.463 --> 18:12.762
Do you remember how messed up you were

18:12.764 --> 18:13.763
when you came back?

18:13.765 --> 18:15.898
Have you forgotten that?

18:20.437 --> 18:24.307
You know, you have to tell him, okay?

18:24.309 --> 18:27.777
At the very least, you have to tell him.

18:30.647 --> 18:32.281
Alright.

19:12.389 --> 19:14.357
Dedicated it to you.

19:16.727 --> 19:18.361
I ran 2,000 yards.

19:39.449 --> 19:40.416
I'm sorry.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.667
I miss you.

20:33.403 --> 20:35.104
Up in there.

20:35.106 --> 20:36.072
Got this.

21:03.900 --> 21:04.967
Ah, rookie.

21:22.052 --> 21:23.185
Listen, Ben.

21:24.988 --> 21:28.124
I don't like to talk about this, but

21:30.093 --> 21:31.827
when I was drafted,

21:32.963 --> 21:34.363
they put me in a helicopter
and they told me

21:34.365 --> 21:38.167
to shoot anything that
wasn't wearing green.

21:39.670 --> 21:40.636
I did.

21:52.649 --> 21:56.952
To this day, I don't know
why I killed those people.

22:01.024 --> 22:04.160
You need to make your own decisions.

22:06.963 --> 22:08.864
Before you pull the trigger,
you need to be able to

22:08.866 --> 22:11.600
look yourself in the mirror,

22:11.602 --> 22:14.070
and say why you're doin' it.

22:15.572 --> 22:17.940
And that you believe in it.

22:51.074 --> 22:53.843
It's fucking weird, not
playing this season.

22:53.845 --> 22:56.746
Yeah, it's bullshit, coach
won't let you play.

22:56.748 --> 22:57.713
Nah.

22:58.815 --> 23:00.349
I understand.

23:00.351 --> 23:03.018
I mean, I'm not gonna be here
for half the games anyway.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.453
Wrong of me to even try out like that.

23:04.455 --> 23:05.688
Yeah, why didn't you wait

23:05.690 --> 23:08.190
'til after after basketball season?

23:08.192 --> 23:09.558
I don't know.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.496
I guess I just didn't think about it.

23:13.498 --> 23:15.030
But in the scheme of things,
what's more important?

23:15.032 --> 23:18.534
Couple high school basketball
games, or the war?

23:18.536 --> 23:20.903
You were gettin' looks from colleges.

23:20.905 --> 23:22.071
Easy decision, bro.

23:22.073 --> 23:23.372
Easy decision.

23:27.344 --> 23:31.647
Your mom still bein' a bitch
about that paperwork?

23:33.650 --> 23:35.851
Man, I'm right behind you.

23:35.853 --> 23:38.220
I mean one way or another,
I turn 18 in August.

23:38.222 --> 23:39.054
I know, man.

23:39.056 --> 23:40.289
It's not your fault.

23:40.291 --> 23:42.358
We're gonna kick some fucking ass.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.492
Don't you worry about it.

23:43.494 --> 23:45.561
Shoot the fucking ball.

23:49.833 --> 23:53.169
So um, you, you know,
watch out for yourself.

23:53.171 --> 23:54.403
I will.

23:54.405 --> 23:55.237
Take care of yourself, really.

23:55.239 --> 23:55.905
I will, I will

23:55.907 --> 23:57.506
okay.

23:57.508 --> 23:59.308
Don't you worry about me.

23:59.310 --> 24:00.843
Okay.

24:00.845 --> 24:02.111
Alright.

24:02.113 --> 24:03.045
Say goodbye, sweetie.

24:03.047 --> 24:03.712
I'll see ya, buddy.

24:05.650 --> 24:06.782
You take care of her.

24:06.784 --> 24:07.684
Got it?

24:09.686 --> 24:11.086
We'll write to you.

24:11.088 --> 24:12.555
Perfect.

24:28.472 --> 24:29.238
Come here.

24:32.609 --> 24:33.909
You come back.

24:34.945 --> 24:36.212
Okay?

24:36.214 --> 24:39.215
We got a tradition to
maintain every summer.

24:39.217 --> 24:40.850
You know I will.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.087
I'm gonna miss you.

25:04.474 --> 25:05.774
Thanks, man.

25:09.679 --> 25:10.980
See ya, buddy.

25:18.522 --> 25:20.589
I'm right behind you.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.207
Hey Ben!

25:40.410 --> 25:42.144
It's five months, man!

25:42.146 --> 25:44.780
Five months 'til you graduate.

26:22.385 --> 26:23.352
Fuck!

27:18.742 --> 27:20.709
Benny, are you okay?

27:21.478 --> 27:22.511
I'm fine.

27:26.483 --> 27:28.751
Look, if you want to yell, then go ahead.

27:28.753 --> 27:31.220
We understand that you're mad,

27:31.222 --> 27:33.389
and you have a right to be.

27:33.391 --> 27:34.790
You can be mad.

27:36.459 --> 27:39.495
And what's there to be mad about?

27:40.563 --> 27:44.733
'Cause you won't let me
be there for my friend?

27:44.735 --> 27:46.669
Won't let me serve my country?

27:46.671 --> 27:48.137
Okay, we will.

27:49.606 --> 27:53.442
As much as it kills us to
think about you getting hurt,

27:53.444 --> 27:57.813
or worse, we're prepared to sign the papers

27:57.815 --> 27:58.747
when you graduate.

27:58.749 --> 28:01.583
I'll do whatever you want.

28:01.585 --> 28:03.385
You continue to apply to colleges,

28:03.387 --> 28:06.922
and you seriously think about the ROTC.

28:06.924 --> 28:07.890
Done.

28:11.828 --> 28:13.629
This hurts us, but

28:15.131 --> 28:18.167
we don't want to stand in your way.

28:19.202 --> 28:20.369
You know, we just wanna make sure

28:20.371 --> 28:23.572
that you really thought this through.

28:43.026 --> 28:43.992
Hello?

28:43.994 --> 28:45.394
Hey, Josh!

28:45.396 --> 28:46.228
Tim!

28:46.230 --> 28:47.663
Hey, buddy!

28:47.665 --> 28:49.732
You want to talk to my brother Benny?

28:49.734 --> 28:53.035
Yes, that would be awesome.

28:53.037 --> 28:55.204
Ben, Tim's on the phone.

28:55.206 --> 28:57.840
Ben, Tim's on the phone.

28:57.842 --> 28:58.774
Hey, man!

28:58.776 --> 29:00.876
Say Ben, what's up?

29:00.878 --> 29:01.944
Same shit, man.

29:01.946 --> 29:03.011
How's boot camp?

29:03.013 --> 29:04.046
Fuckin' sucks!

29:04.048 --> 29:05.114
But I crushed it, bro.

29:05.116 --> 29:06.348
Thank god it's family day.

29:06.350 --> 29:08.317
Feels like I haven't slept in 53 days.

29:08.319 --> 29:10.119
Oh yeah, not that you're counting, right?

29:10.121 --> 29:11.386
Oh and dude?

29:11.388 --> 29:13.989
The fucking guys down here, they are scary.

29:13.991 --> 29:17.192
One of 'em asked me who the
commander of chief was.

29:17.194 --> 29:19.962
I told him it was the king
of all native Americans.

29:28.838 --> 29:33.142
Your picture looks really good there, Josh.

29:38.148 --> 29:39.948
Hey!

29:39.950 --> 29:41.250
Hi!

29:41.252 --> 29:42.618
Oh, hey guys.

29:43.353 --> 29:44.186
How are you?

29:44.188 --> 29:45.020
Good.

29:45.022 --> 29:45.854
How are you?

29:45.856 --> 29:46.889
I'm good.

29:59.068 --> 30:01.303
So, what's for dinner?

30:01.305 --> 30:02.771
Benny!

30:02.773 --> 30:04.406
Oh, what's this?

30:12.749 --> 30:14.883
Dear Benjamin, we're pleased to announce

30:14.885 --> 30:17.519
you've been accepted to
northeastern university.

30:17.521 --> 30:18.353
Please see attach...

30:18.355 --> 30:19.521
yes!

30:19.523 --> 30:20.055
For important financial worksheets.

30:20.057 --> 30:21.390
Oh!

30:21.392 --> 30:22.724
Congratulations.

30:25.362 --> 30:27.062
What does that mean?

30:27.064 --> 30:28.664
Benny got into college.

30:28.666 --> 30:31.633
Yay, Benny doesn't have to go away!

30:31.635 --> 30:32.568
Oh.

30:32.570 --> 30:33.535
Shh.

30:36.472 --> 30:38.607
Here, let me get that.

30:52.522 --> 30:53.822
Brick!

30:54.924 --> 30:56.525
Say, Ben!

30:56.527 --> 30:57.359
Hey.

30:57.361 --> 30:58.193
Nice hat.

30:58.195 --> 30:59.027
Alright, fuck you.

30:59.029 --> 31:00.095
It's cold up here.

31:00.097 --> 31:01.797
What's up, man?

31:01.799 --> 31:02.764
What's goin' on?

31:04.168 --> 31:07.002
Your dad said I'd catch you here, man.

31:07.004 --> 31:09.037
Yeah, I got a few days of leave,

31:09.039 --> 31:10.572
and then I fucking deploy.

31:10.574 --> 31:12.674
Damn, that's quick.

31:12.676 --> 31:13.942
Yeah.

31:13.944 --> 31:16.245
Some unit had a group
of guys get in trouble

31:16.247 --> 31:17.646
a few months back, so they got no choice

31:17.648 --> 31:20.782
but to take me and a few others from Soi.

31:20.784 --> 31:22.751
But hey, sure beats sittin' in my barracks

31:22.753 --> 31:24.820
listen to the other guy in
my rack beat off above me.

31:24.822 --> 31:26.154
Oh, fuck.

31:26.156 --> 31:27.789
It's cool, he never lasts that long.

31:27.791 --> 31:30.592
What?

31:30.594 --> 31:33.362
Some ROTC recruiter guy came by the school

31:33.364 --> 31:36.231
and a bunch of guys signed
that letter of interest thing.

31:36.233 --> 31:37.900
Yeah, a bunch of pussies
need a back-up plan

31:37.902 --> 31:39.067
'cause they're soft.

31:39.069 --> 31:42.037
Tryin' to get something out of it.

31:47.076 --> 31:50.078
So what's goin' on since I've been gone?

31:50.080 --> 31:53.048
Teachers, they don't
know what to do with us.

31:54.618 --> 31:57.719
Nobody does their homework, and you know.

31:57.721 --> 31:58.787
Homework?

31:59.923 --> 32:02.024
That's so weird.

32:02.026 --> 32:03.525
Yeah.

32:03.527 --> 32:05.827
Everybody's already gotten
into college, you know?

32:05.829 --> 32:07.362
Yeah, where's everyone goin'?

32:07.364 --> 32:08.697
Well your ex got rejected.

32:08.699 --> 32:09.531
Good.

32:09.533 --> 32:10.365
She's a fucking whore.

32:10.367 --> 32:12.801
Okay.

32:12.803 --> 32:14.236
Bobby Lachey's goin' to Harvard.

32:14.238 --> 32:15.270
Smart bastard.

32:15.272 --> 32:17.239
Joe is goin' to Westfield.

32:17.241 --> 32:18.774
Of course he's goin' to Westfield.

32:18.776 --> 32:21.143
His grandfather went there,
his father went there,

32:21.145 --> 32:23.011
his fucking kids are gonna go to Westfield.

32:23.013 --> 32:23.979
Shit.

32:25.214 --> 32:26.181
Yeah.

32:26.183 --> 32:27.149
I got in.

32:29.419 --> 32:31.453
Got a scholarship, too.

32:35.325 --> 32:36.291
Okay.

32:37.427 --> 32:39.227
What does that mean?

32:40.229 --> 32:41.430
Nothin'.

32:41.432 --> 32:44.166
I mean that was the deal, you know?

32:44.168 --> 32:46.268
I apply to college, my dad sign the papers.

32:46.270 --> 32:49.237
Three more months 'til I graduate.

32:53.409 --> 32:55.677
Yeah, I better get going.

32:55.679 --> 32:58.146
Mom's making Shepherd's pie.

33:00.683 --> 33:01.817
I'll see ya.

34:20.029 --> 34:21.830
Dig a little hole.

34:23.498 --> 34:27.469
Let's go, form up,.

34:31.842 --> 34:33.442
Okay, we're approaching our target.

34:33.444 --> 34:35.243
Everybody watch your sectors.

34:35.245 --> 34:36.812
We're gonna move in a wedge formation

34:36.813 --> 34:38.914
to the south side of that mountain.

34:38.916 --> 34:40.549
Let's head out.

34:57.700 --> 34:58.967
Take cover!

35:04.440 --> 35:06.808
Cover me!

35:06.810 --> 35:08.343
Take cover! Go!

35:17.386 --> 35:19.187
In position! Move!

35:30.666 --> 35:31.766
Oh fuck.

35:31.768 --> 35:32.868
Oh shit.

35:34.872 --> 35:36.404
Coming! Coming!

35:41.712 --> 35:42.577
I got this.

35:42.579 --> 35:43.411
Go!

35:44.448 --> 35:45.413
You're gonna be alright, buddy.

35:45.415 --> 35:46.715
I'll take care of ya.

35:46.717 --> 35:49.017
Are you hit anywhere else?

35:51.888 --> 35:53.755
Ammo discipline!

35:55.025 --> 35:55.957
He shot

35:57.561 --> 35:58.560
Move out!

36:03.699 --> 36:05.600
Get him behind cover!

36:10.607 --> 36:11.806
Come on!

36:16.546 --> 36:17.646
He sees me!

36:17.648 --> 36:18.613
Come down!

36:20.316 --> 36:21.283
I'm up!

36:23.486 --> 36:24.452
Down!

36:26.056 --> 36:27.122
I'm up!

37:03.726 --> 37:05.493
In position! Move!

37:26.649 --> 37:28.149
Don't have a clear shot!

37:28.151 --> 37:29.684
Take that fucker out!

37:37.627 --> 37:40.762
Is target neutralized!

37:41.864 --> 37:43.098
Esty!

37:43.100 --> 37:45.567
Go make sure that target is down!

38:08.257 --> 38:09.224
Esty!

38:49.366 --> 38:50.298
If you were a chick,

38:50.300 --> 38:53.001
you'd have a pretty nice ass.

38:53.003 --> 38:54.369
Hey esty, how long you been back there

38:54.371 --> 38:56.171
thinkin' about that?

38:57.373 --> 39:00.575
Heh, for the last five miles.

39:00.577 --> 39:03.111
Sounds like four and a half miles too long.

39:03.113 --> 39:04.346
You know what?

39:04.348 --> 39:05.280
Go ahead and put that on the list of shit

39:05.282 --> 39:07.515
you can't say to me anymore.

39:07.517 --> 39:09.584
Aye-aye, sergeant.

40:08.411 --> 40:11.379
Ben,.

40:14.183 --> 40:15.150
Ben, Ben.

40:24.527 --> 40:25.593
I love you.

40:28.964 --> 40:30.165
It's alright.

41:01.630 --> 41:03.431
This is bullshit.

41:03.433 --> 41:05.900
Better down here than up there.

41:05.902 --> 41:07.702
I don't like this.

41:11.607 --> 41:14.509
We've been scoutin' for seven hours.

41:14.511 --> 41:16.010
Seven miles out.

41:16.012 --> 41:19.314
The Hajis are all up in the mountains.

41:32.127 --> 41:33.761
Fucking huge, man!

41:38.000 --> 41:39.868
Blister on my big toe so big

41:39.870 --> 41:42.103
I think it's got a fucking face.

41:42.105 --> 41:44.772
Esty, let me check my big
book of I don't give a shit,

41:44.774 --> 41:47.809
and see if that blister on
your big toe is in there.

41:47.811 --> 41:49.344
Yup, hey it's right there.

41:49.346 --> 41:51.346
Right next to your jock itch
and erectile dysfunction.

41:51.348 --> 41:52.313
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:52.315 --> 41:54.082
It wasn't erectile dysfunction.

41:54.084 --> 41:55.517
I have poor circulation.

41:55.519 --> 41:56.851
Poor circulation.

41:56.853 --> 41:57.852
I'll be sure to tell that to my wife

41:57.854 --> 41:58.786
the next time I...

44:20.664 --> 44:21.629
Hi.

44:24.833 --> 44:25.800
Listen.

44:27.002 --> 44:28.536
Just keep trying.

44:29.238 --> 44:30.805
We don't give up.

44:31.907 --> 44:34.442
Now, chop me some ship.

44:34.444 --> 44:35.677
Get in there.

44:39.181 --> 44:40.114
Oh, after you're done,

44:40.116 --> 44:42.817
can you get your father, please?

44:47.890 --> 44:48.856
Yo, pop!

44:50.426 --> 44:51.659
Pop.

44:51.661 --> 44:53.695
I refuse to answer to that.

44:53.697 --> 44:54.696
Pop!

44:54.698 --> 44:55.563
What?

44:55.565 --> 44:57.231
Dinner.

44:57.233 --> 44:58.499
Stop calling me that.

44:58.501 --> 45:00.168
Calling you what?

45:00.170 --> 45:01.135
Pop.

45:02.671 --> 45:06.240
God, you're making me feel
so old with that pop shit.

45:06.242 --> 45:08.109
Which is exactly why he does it.

45:08.111 --> 45:09.410
You're just encouraging him.

45:09.412 --> 45:11.879
Oh, this smells delicious.

45:12.748 --> 45:13.715
Oh, hey.

45:14.717 --> 45:16.250
You don't know what you got here, kid.

45:16.252 --> 45:17.652
This broad's a gem.

45:21.056 --> 45:22.824
Hey you remember your mom's cooking.

45:22.826 --> 45:25.226
Oh, recipes are merely a suggestion,

45:25.228 --> 45:26.127
not a requirement.

45:27.997 --> 45:31.065
Yeah, she was certainly creative.

45:35.838 --> 45:37.805
As long as you have barbecue
sauce, it was okay.

45:37.807 --> 45:39.040
Hah!

45:39.042 --> 45:40.508
Barbecue sauce and ranch dressing.

45:40.510 --> 45:43.711
They were a whole food group.

45:43.713 --> 45:45.780
That's probably why you already got

45:45.782 --> 45:47.515
that high blood pressure, huh?

45:47.517 --> 45:48.783
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

45:48.785 --> 45:50.551
that's because of your shitty genes.

45:50.553 --> 45:51.986
Shitty genes, me?

45:51.988 --> 45:53.187
Okay, sit, sit, sit.

45:53.189 --> 45:54.255
It's ready.

46:00.362 --> 46:02.263
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

46:05.567 --> 46:07.435
Light on peppers, go.

46:10.472 --> 46:11.305
Some peppers.

46:11.307 --> 46:12.573
Hmm, no.

46:12.575 --> 46:13.407
That's enough.

46:13.409 --> 46:14.776
At least two.

46:23.352 --> 46:27.655
God damn calorie gestapo.

46:28.423 --> 46:30.725
Did you take your pills?

46:31.727 --> 46:32.994
They're on your nightstand.

46:32.996 --> 46:34.729
Okay, okay, okay.

47:25.647 --> 47:29.083
And the surgeon just starts
sawing into this guy's leg

47:29.085 --> 47:30.985
with what was essentially a chainsaw.

47:30.987 --> 47:33.454
I mean no warning whatsoever.

47:33.456 --> 47:36.624
There was blood and bone
chips shooting everywhere.

47:36.626 --> 47:39.227
I was taking bone out of his
hair when he came home.

47:39.229 --> 47:41.662
The last thing I remember
I was trying to swallow

47:41.664 --> 47:44.332
that hot spit you get right
before you throw up,

47:44.334 --> 47:46.067
and then just, wham!

47:46.069 --> 47:48.102
My head hits the floor.

47:57.546 --> 47:59.747
Oh, I mean when I finally
did regain consciousness,

47:59.749 --> 48:04.185
I was sitting in a wheelchair
in the middle of a hallway.

48:04.187 --> 48:06.821
Imagine opening your eyes,
and the first thing you see

48:06.823 --> 48:10.591
is this guy wearing his
hospital gown backwards...

48:10.593 --> 48:11.859
ew.

48:11.861 --> 48:13.694
And he just looks at you, and he says,

48:13.696 --> 48:14.996
do you know how we got here?

48:16.699 --> 48:17.665
Oh no!

48:19.935 --> 48:21.102
Which way is the bathroom?

48:21.104 --> 48:23.671
Oh, I'll go with you.

48:51.366 --> 48:52.500
Tim?

48:54.937 --> 48:55.903
Yeah.

49:04.279 --> 49:06.914
I didn't know you were home.

49:07.816 --> 49:08.783
No?

49:16.525 --> 49:17.658
We should,

49:20.395 --> 49:22.096
we should get together some time, catch up.

49:22.098 --> 49:23.664
It's been awhile.

49:34.776 --> 49:39.714
You know I got every one of
those letters you sent me?

49:39.716 --> 49:43.351
There's a reason you never got a response.

50:17.819 --> 50:19.887
That's bullshit, and you know it.

50:19.889 --> 50:24.191
I mean you know exactly why
he told me to fuck off.

50:25.494 --> 50:27.862
And you know, I deserve it.

50:33.802 --> 50:35.269
I deserve worse.

50:36.638 --> 50:39.273
I mean I fucking promised him.

50:40.208 --> 50:41.475
I should've just...

50:41.477 --> 50:43.677
Ben, you didn't believe in it, okay?

50:43.679 --> 50:44.745
It wasn't you...

50:44.747 --> 50:46.113
but I gave him my word.

50:46.115 --> 50:47.048
You were 17!

50:47.050 --> 50:49.016
I did believe in it!

50:51.353 --> 50:52.953
Was I just scared?

50:52.955 --> 50:54.355
I don't know.

50:54.357 --> 50:57.391
You know, maybe you
stopped believing in it.

50:57.393 --> 50:59.060
Listen, you hate how the military is used.

50:59.062 --> 51:00.661
You say it all the time.

51:00.663 --> 51:03.731
This thing's just so fucked
up, and there's no fixing it.

51:03.733 --> 51:07.301
I mean what did I think was gonna happen?

51:08.703 --> 51:10.171
I'm so fucking stupid.

51:10.173 --> 51:12.606
Ben, you're not stupid.

51:12.608 --> 51:14.075
No, I'm worse.

51:29.225 --> 51:30.157
Hmph.

53:02.150 --> 53:03.384
Catch much, pop?

53:03.386 --> 53:04.785
Hey, if I wanted any of your lip,

53:04.787 --> 53:06.487
I'd unzip my pants.

53:06.489 --> 53:07.955
That is gross.

53:09.291 --> 53:11.358
Remember when you said that
to your kindergarten teacher?

53:11.360 --> 53:12.793
Mrs. umm...

53:12.795 --> 53:14.728
oh, Mrs. Pinkum.

53:14.730 --> 53:16.263
God.

53:16.265 --> 53:18.265
Your mother was mortified.

53:18.267 --> 53:19.433
Yeah, you really let me go down

53:19.435 --> 53:20.868
with the ship on that one.

53:20.870 --> 53:22.703
Well that's.

53:22.705 --> 53:24.471
Yeah well I had to, pal.

53:24.473 --> 53:26.774
She would've crucified me.

53:28.677 --> 53:30.411
You know what, this is good.

53:30.413 --> 53:32.580
You've been cooped up in that
house ever since mom died.

53:32.582 --> 53:33.514
It's...

53:33.516 --> 53:35.983
I'm sellin' the cabin, Ben.

53:37.018 --> 53:37.985
Ben...

53:40.689 --> 53:41.889
That place...

53:44.025 --> 53:44.992
It's her.

53:46.861 --> 53:49.396
She picked out the doorknobs.

53:53.635 --> 53:55.336
I just can't do it.

53:57.505 --> 53:58.472
I'm gonna go up there.

53:58.474 --> 53:59.740
I'm gonna pack some things.

53:59.742 --> 54:02.009
I'm gonna close the house down,

54:02.011 --> 54:04.745
I'm gonna put a sign out front.

54:06.414 --> 54:08.849
Hey, you're coming with me.

54:08.851 --> 54:11.051
Dad, I got so much stuff goin' on,

54:11.053 --> 54:12.286
and with layoffs at Lily's...

54:12.288 --> 54:15.189
I already talked to her.

54:15.191 --> 54:17.658
Yeah, you're coming with me.

54:23.031 --> 54:23.998
Alright.

54:33.742 --> 54:36.877
Just make sure you're there
in case he needs to talk.

54:36.879 --> 54:38.445
We're goin' to the cabin.

54:38.447 --> 54:39.280
He loves it up there.

54:39.282 --> 54:40.814
He's gonna be fine.

54:40.816 --> 54:44.451
He hasn't been there since
your mom passed away.

54:44.453 --> 54:45.419
I know.

54:46.755 --> 54:51.158
Just promise me you'll keep an eye on him.

54:51.160 --> 54:52.793
Lill, he's my dad.

54:52.795 --> 54:53.961
Okay?

54:53.963 --> 54:54.795
I got this.

54:54.797 --> 54:56.030
Gonna be fun.

55:16.818 --> 55:17.718
What's wrong?

55:20.155 --> 55:23.324
Nothin', I just wanted to
get on the road sooner.

55:23.326 --> 55:24.658
Oh, okay.

55:24.660 --> 55:25.626
Well bye.

55:27.095 --> 55:27.928
Love you.

55:27.930 --> 55:30.164
I love you, too.

55:30.166 --> 55:31.865
You sure old Susie's gonna make it?

55:31.867 --> 55:33.300
Oh, I already offered.

55:33.302 --> 55:35.169
He does not want to take the car.

55:35.171 --> 55:36.704
Yeah, don't worry.

55:36.706 --> 55:38.505
She's got one more trip in her.

55:38.507 --> 55:39.973
Hey Susie and I have
been through a lot worse

55:39.975 --> 55:42.343
than a quick trip to Maine.

55:44.813 --> 55:46.146
How long a drive is it?

55:46.148 --> 55:47.715
10 hours.

55:48.750 --> 55:50.584
Is there cell service?

55:55.156 --> 55:57.291
How will I know you got there safe?

55:57.293 --> 55:59.893
That's the fun of it.

55:59.895 --> 56:01.362
Now don't worry.

56:01.364 --> 56:03.430
We'll be back in three days.

56:03.432 --> 56:04.832
I'll let you know when we get to Portland,

56:04.834 --> 56:08.469
and then again when we're on our way home.

56:10.171 --> 56:11.338
Keep him safe.

56:11.340 --> 56:12.906
I will.

56:35.363 --> 56:37.498
I didn't know you were coming.

56:37.500 --> 56:40.267
I'm here for your father.

56:40.269 --> 56:41.702
Hey, he's here.

56:41.704 --> 56:42.569
We're all here.

56:42.571 --> 56:43.837
That's all that matters.

57:48.170 --> 57:49.403
Oh!

57:49.405 --> 57:51.405
I forgot how long of a drive this was.

57:51.407 --> 57:53.774
It's 574 beautiful miles.

57:58.880 --> 57:59.780
Pull over.

57:59.782 --> 58:01.515
I gotta take a piss.

58:30.078 --> 58:33.881
So you gonna tell me what the deal is?

58:33.883 --> 58:35.249
No deal.

58:35.251 --> 58:38.619
Just thought I'd ask him to come along.

58:40.522 --> 58:42.890
Yeah, this is gonna be fun.

59:35.311 --> 59:37.578
Seat belts.

59:41.749 --> 59:42.783
Hey! Hey!

59:46.821 --> 59:47.788
I'm up.

59:49.958 --> 59:51.024
Hey, hey, hey knock it off!

59:51.026 --> 59:52.292
I didn't live through two tours

59:52.294 --> 59:54.328
to die in the middle of butt-fuck Maine!

59:54.330 --> 59:55.429
Now we're in business!

59:55.431 --> 59:57.164
No, no, no, no!

59:58.701 --> 01:00:01.001
Cut this shit out!

01:00:03.839 --> 01:00:05.272
Fucking hilarious.

01:00:05.274 --> 01:00:07.908
Oh, stop being a pussy!

01:00:11.647 --> 01:00:13.046
How far out are we?

01:00:13.048 --> 01:00:14.881
About 100 miles.

01:00:14.883 --> 01:00:16.216
Oh, that's fucking great.

01:00:16.218 --> 01:00:17.284
This truck bed's real fucking...

01:00:52.987 --> 01:00:54.187
smell that?

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:58.325
There's nothing like that.

01:00:58.327 --> 01:01:00.060
Now you guys grab the
bags out of the truck,

01:01:00.062 --> 01:01:01.261
bring the fishing poles.

01:01:01.263 --> 01:01:02.896
I'm gonna go throw the boat in the lake.

01:01:02.898 --> 01:01:05.332
Want a hand?

01:01:05.334 --> 01:01:06.566
Fuck you.

01:01:06.568 --> 01:01:08.535
I'm old, I'm not dead.

01:01:53.781 --> 01:01:55.215
You remember that time you got the hook

01:01:55.217 --> 01:01:56.516
stuck in your thumb?

01:01:56.518 --> 01:01:58.485
Oh man, I got myself pretty good.

01:01:58.487 --> 01:02:00.520
We were all bent outta shape after that.

01:02:00.522 --> 01:02:02.789
I was bleedin' like a stuck pig!

01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:04.157
You remember what you said?

01:02:04.159 --> 01:02:05.392
No.

01:02:05.394 --> 01:02:06.326
You wrap that shit in duct tape.

01:02:06.328 --> 01:02:08.095
You said, better than stitches.

01:02:09.631 --> 01:02:10.630
Well yeah, it turns out it
wasn't better than stitches.

01:02:10.632 --> 01:02:13.433
Left me with a pretty good scar.

01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:20.240
You use duct tape for all
sorts of shit out there.

01:02:20.242 --> 01:02:23.310
Saved our sorry asses
more than a couple times.

01:02:26.547 --> 01:02:27.514
What?

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.217
Nothing.

01:02:31.152 --> 01:02:33.620
Didn't sound like nothing.

01:02:35.156 --> 01:02:36.356
Whoa.

01:02:37.258 --> 01:02:39.559
You got something?

01:02:40.928 --> 01:02:41.895
No.

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:47.567
You're making this awkward.

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:51.905
You both got great, big veiny dicks, okay?

01:02:51.907 --> 01:02:53.907
Let's just fish.

01:02:53.909 --> 01:02:55.108
Big?

01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:56.543
Jesus.

01:02:59.881 --> 01:03:01.114
Hi.

01:03:01.116 --> 01:03:05.152
Whoa, that's what I call
a successful day, huh?

01:03:06.888 --> 01:03:08.421
Yeah.

01:03:08.423 --> 01:03:12.325
Oh no, after you, our resident angler, huh?

01:03:30.879 --> 01:03:32.179
Oh, excellent.

01:03:33.281 --> 01:03:35.682
Well now we're in business.

01:03:41.322 --> 01:03:42.622
Cutting board.

01:03:44.225 --> 01:03:46.560
What do we got here?

01:03:46.562 --> 01:03:48.195
What the fuck?

01:03:48.197 --> 01:03:50.230
You call this a keeper?

01:03:52.267 --> 01:03:53.200
What?

01:03:53.202 --> 01:03:54.768
It's pitch black out there.

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:56.937
It felt way bigger than that.

01:03:56.939 --> 01:03:58.471
Yeah, that's what she said.

01:03:58.473 --> 01:03:59.339
To who?

01:04:04.446 --> 01:04:07.647
Mm, there's not enough
here to make a fish stick!

01:04:10.785 --> 01:04:11.751
Gentlemen!

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.621
Tonight we dine like kings!

01:04:19.494 --> 01:04:20.961
I had no idea.

01:04:22.496 --> 01:04:25.432
Her grandfather was a bush pilot.

01:04:25.434 --> 01:04:28.768
Flew her up to Moosehead lake
when she was a little girl.

01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:31.671
She wanted to share that with me.

01:04:32.506 --> 01:04:34.140
How did you end up here?

01:04:34.142 --> 01:04:37.544
Oh, the directions were 20 years old,

01:04:38.546 --> 01:04:41.815
and so faded, you could barely read 'em.

01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:45.552
We drove around for hours.

01:04:45.554 --> 01:04:50.357
God, she got us so lost.

01:04:50.359 --> 01:04:54.427
And then, then we found
this dilapidated cabin.

01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:58.732
No electricity, no water.

01:05:00.902 --> 01:05:03.303
But she knew that was where

01:05:04.305 --> 01:05:07.307
we were meant to spend our honeymoon.

01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:08.441
She knew it.

01:05:10.611 --> 01:05:12.245
Only cost $14,000.

01:05:13.481 --> 01:05:16.783
So we broke in that night,
spent the night on the floor,

01:05:16.785 --> 01:05:19.419
and we bought it the next day.

01:05:20.821 --> 01:05:23.924
Your father and I, we
built that back section

01:05:23.926 --> 01:05:26.326
when you and Ben were born.

01:05:29.897 --> 01:05:31.698
But that first week,

01:05:34.068 --> 01:05:37.370
that was the happiest time of my life.

01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:39.239
So simple.

01:07:18.506 --> 01:07:19.672
I'm hungry.

01:07:19.674 --> 01:07:21.041
Who's hungry?

01:07:21.043 --> 01:07:23.076
Oh!

01:07:23.078 --> 01:07:25.478
Oh.

01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:11.157
Pop!

01:13:30.345 --> 01:13:31.310
Morning.

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:38.551
What time is it?

01:13:40.053 --> 01:13:42.221
Like, 10.

01:13:42.223 --> 01:13:43.189
No shit.

01:13:54.535 --> 01:13:57.270
How long has he been out there?

01:14:00.974 --> 01:14:03.276
Oh, I shoulda gotten up.

01:14:24.531 --> 01:14:25.498
Dad!

01:14:28.168 --> 01:14:29.135
Dad!

01:14:31.538 --> 01:14:32.505
Dad!

01:14:33.507 --> 01:14:34.474
Dad!

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:51.357
Dad, dad!

01:14:52.459 --> 01:14:53.659
Hey slow down, slow down.

01:14:53.661 --> 01:14:55.962
I'll go to the other side.

01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:00.333
Go, go, go!

01:15:08.942 --> 01:15:10.343
Alright, Ben!

01:15:10.345 --> 01:15:11.844
Ben.

01:15:11.846 --> 01:15:12.812
Ben.

01:15:13.614 --> 01:15:14.814
Grab my hand.

01:15:14.816 --> 01:15:15.748
No, no, no, no!

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:17.950
Ben, Ben, grab my hand.

01:15:32.566 --> 01:15:33.499
Over here, over here.

01:15:33.501 --> 01:15:34.300
Grab his head, grab his head!

01:15:34.302 --> 01:15:35.334
Pull him back, come on!

01:15:36.437 --> 01:15:37.403
Come on!

01:15:38.138 --> 01:15:40.339
On his back, on his back.

01:15:42.543 --> 01:15:44.243
You know CPR?

01:15:44.245 --> 01:15:46.345
Okay, I'll do three minutes, then you.

01:15:46.347 --> 01:15:47.813
One, two, three, four, five,

01:15:47.815 --> 01:15:49.415
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

01:15:49.417 --> 01:15:52.218
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:55.621
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

01:16:02.329 --> 01:16:05.164
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

01:16:05.166 --> 01:16:06.365
come on!

01:16:06.367 --> 01:16:07.366
Come on, come on not today, old man!

01:16:07.368 --> 01:16:08.200
Come on!

01:16:08.202 --> 01:16:09.035
Today's not your day!

01:16:09.037 --> 01:16:09.969
Come on!

01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:11.504
28, 29, 30!

01:16:11.506 --> 01:16:12.705
Go breathe, breathe!

01:16:12.707 --> 01:16:14.273
Breathe, breathe!

01:16:15.475 --> 01:16:17.209
Good, good, good, good, good!

01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:18.244
Somebody!

01:16:19.646 --> 01:16:21.380
Somebody help us!

01:16:41.134 --> 01:16:43.336
Breathe, breathe.

01:16:56.383 --> 01:16:58.584
It's been two hours, Ben.

01:17:01.221 --> 01:17:02.154
Ben!

01:17:02.156 --> 01:17:03.255
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:17:03.257 --> 01:17:04.090
Ben, he's gone

01:17:04.092 --> 01:17:04.924
don't stop!

01:17:04.926 --> 01:17:06.592
Keep going!

01:17:06.594 --> 01:17:10.796
He's gone.

01:17:11.832 --> 01:17:13.699
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:17:23.477 --> 01:17:24.443
Hey!

01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:12.551
What do you want to do?

01:19:15.222 --> 01:19:16.756
We need to do something.

01:19:16.758 --> 01:19:17.757
It's been three hours.

01:19:17.759 --> 01:19:18.457
Things are gonna start to happen.

01:19:18.459 --> 01:19:19.425
I know.

01:19:26.466 --> 01:19:27.666
Put him in the truck?

01:19:27.668 --> 01:19:30.302
Drive to the nearest hospital.

01:20:42.742 --> 01:20:44.543
Want to tie it down?

01:20:45.946 --> 01:20:49.081
I just don't want it sliding around.

01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:51.217
Just get in the truck.

01:21:30.658 --> 01:21:31.891
No!

01:21:31.893 --> 01:21:33.192
No!

01:21:33.194 --> 01:21:34.159
Fuck!

01:21:49.409 --> 01:21:51.043
Alright, what's your plan here?

01:21:51.045 --> 01:21:52.811
I'm gonna walk.

01:21:52.813 --> 01:21:56.982
Okay great, now let's think this through.

01:21:56.984 --> 01:21:59.118
What's wrong with you?

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.854
He's dead, Tim!

01:22:01.856 --> 01:22:04.089
My dad just died.

01:22:04.091 --> 01:22:06.191
Yeah I know, I was here.

01:22:06.193 --> 01:22:08.527
Do you even know what this is like?

01:22:08.529 --> 01:22:11.897
I mean can you be human for one second?

01:22:13.833 --> 01:22:15.968
We need to think this through.

01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:17.569
That's 175 pounds.

01:22:17.571 --> 01:22:20.005
We're at least 100 miles
from any kind of help.

01:22:20.007 --> 01:22:22.141
We don't have the gear, the
supplies, or the manpower

01:22:22.143 --> 01:22:23.309
to carry him that far.

01:22:23.311 --> 01:22:25.177
I'll take care of it.

01:22:25.179 --> 01:22:27.746
No, you'll end up dead from
dehydration or exhaustion.

01:22:27.748 --> 01:22:29.748
Then you become my problem.

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.016
Ben, your arm's already shaking.

01:22:31.018 --> 01:22:32.117
You haven't even reached
the end of the driveway.

01:22:32.119 --> 01:22:34.186
Don't worry about us!

01:22:35.889 --> 01:22:36.722
We'll be fine.

01:22:36.724 --> 01:22:37.556
No!

01:22:37.558 --> 01:22:38.757
You won't be fine!

01:22:38.759 --> 01:22:40.526
What you're trying to do cannot be done!

01:22:40.528 --> 01:22:43.595
Better men have tried, and failed!

01:22:43.597 --> 01:22:45.464
Then help me.

01:22:45.466 --> 01:22:47.499
I'm trying to.

01:22:52.906 --> 01:22:55.140
What is wrong with you?

01:22:56.776 --> 01:22:57.977
He was old.

01:22:59.346 --> 01:23:00.346
I'm sorry.

01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:03.148
He had a great run.

01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:04.350
Shit, he went out on top!

01:23:04.352 --> 01:23:07.086
Heart attack in paradise!

01:23:07.088 --> 01:23:08.687
I can come up with a lot worse ways to go!

01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:10.389
Sorry I'm not so broken up about it,

01:23:10.391 --> 01:23:13.459
but this, this is the world I'm
very fucking familiar with.

01:23:13.461 --> 01:23:15.361
Oh, you're such an asshole.

01:23:15.363 --> 01:23:16.595
Why?

01:23:16.597 --> 01:23:19.031
'Cause I'm here for him, and not you?

01:23:19.033 --> 01:23:20.599
I loved the guy, man.

01:23:20.601 --> 01:23:22.134
I really did.

01:23:22.136 --> 01:23:24.336
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for him.

01:23:24.338 --> 01:23:26.171
Not a chance in hell!

01:23:26.173 --> 01:23:27.506
Really though, what'd you expect?

01:23:27.508 --> 01:23:28.640
My friend!

01:23:29.843 --> 01:23:31.710
I expected my friend!

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.214
Where's that guy?

01:23:38.752 --> 01:23:39.718
Dead.

01:23:41.488 --> 01:23:43.622
You left that guy.

01:23:43.624 --> 01:23:47.926
And he died in some shit hole
in the middle of the desert.

01:23:51.264 --> 01:23:53.165
I'm right behind you!

01:23:55.702 --> 01:23:57.336
You remember that?

01:23:59.406 --> 01:24:02.975
That guy held his real best friend's hand

01:24:03.977 --> 01:24:05.577
while he bled out from a shrapnel wound

01:24:05.579 --> 01:24:08.147
that tore his body to pieces!

01:24:10.417 --> 01:24:11.817
He lied to him!

01:24:12.886 --> 01:24:15.687
Told him he was gonna be
okay while he bled out!

01:24:17.024 --> 01:24:19.391
Try being human after that!

01:24:20.527 --> 01:24:23.695
You ever felt someone's hopes and dreams

01:24:23.697 --> 01:24:25.230
leave their body?

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:30.536
Held their hand as their skin turned gray?

01:24:31.604 --> 01:24:33.806
And they shit themselves?

01:24:37.944 --> 01:24:39.344
Where were you?

01:24:40.213 --> 01:24:41.513
You never let me apologize.

01:24:41.515 --> 01:24:43.582
I've always been sorry.

01:24:50.457 --> 01:24:52.591
You fucking should be.

01:25:08.409 --> 01:25:09.875
Get the shovels.

01:25:10.944 --> 01:25:12.511
Can't leave him inside,
and we can't carry him.

01:25:12.513 --> 01:25:13.579
It's too far.

01:25:49.315 --> 01:25:51.116
It's not a bad view.

01:26:19.946 --> 01:26:20.913
You up?

01:26:24.751 --> 01:26:27.553
Yeah.

01:26:34.594 --> 01:26:35.661
Let's go.

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:16.969
You're not drinking enough.

01:27:16.971 --> 01:27:20.839
Come on last thing we need
is you gettin' dehydrated.

01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:21.640
Come on.

01:27:21.642 --> 01:27:22.474
Enough!

01:27:22.476 --> 01:27:23.742
I'm fine.

01:27:23.744 --> 01:27:25.110
Your body needs water.

01:27:25.112 --> 01:27:26.211
Simple biology.

01:27:26.213 --> 01:27:28.046
I'm not thirsty.

01:27:28.048 --> 01:27:30.115
Hey man, just take the water.

01:27:30.117 --> 01:27:31.450
What the fuck, man!

01:27:31.452 --> 01:27:33.185
We don't have enough clean water, as it is!

01:27:33.187 --> 01:27:35.020
Then just leave me alone!

01:27:35.022 --> 01:27:36.255
If you get dehydrated,

01:27:36.257 --> 01:27:37.889
I won't be able to get us both outta here!

01:27:37.891 --> 01:27:39.625
I don't need you to get me outta here.

01:27:39.627 --> 01:27:41.293
Alright, fucking tough guy.

01:27:41.295 --> 01:27:44.029
You know, I'm so sick of your macho shit.

01:27:44.031 --> 01:27:44.863
Excuse me!

01:27:44.865 --> 01:27:46.798
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.003
But we have a real, genuine,
certified bad-ass here.

01:27:51.005 --> 01:27:53.138
Fucking congratulations.

01:27:55.241 --> 01:27:56.541
You hear that?

01:27:58.244 --> 01:28:01.947
That's the sound of the world not clapping.

01:28:03.583 --> 01:28:04.816
You're a fucking prick.

01:28:04.818 --> 01:28:05.651
I'm a prick?

01:28:05.653 --> 01:28:06.485
Yeah.

01:28:06.487 --> 01:28:07.586
You.

01:28:07.588 --> 01:28:09.154
Where do you get off?

01:28:09.156 --> 01:28:10.489
What do you have to be so mad about?

01:28:10.491 --> 01:28:11.890
Everything.

01:28:11.892 --> 01:28:13.125
Blowing this out of proportion
a bit, don't you think?

01:28:13.127 --> 01:28:15.294
I just buried my father in the dirt!

01:28:15.296 --> 01:28:17.596
And where you goin' now, huh?

01:28:17.598 --> 01:28:19.264
Back home?

01:28:19.266 --> 01:28:21.099
To your wife?

01:28:21.101 --> 01:28:22.501
To your perfect home?

01:28:22.503 --> 01:28:23.769
Your perfect little life?

01:28:23.771 --> 01:28:25.103
You chose not to have those things.

01:28:25.105 --> 01:28:26.038
What?

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:26.772
No, I didn't make that choice!

01:28:26.774 --> 01:28:28.006
I didn't get to!

01:28:28.008 --> 01:28:29.174
Please, are you fucking serious?

01:28:29.176 --> 01:28:31.543
Yes, I'm fucking serious.

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:37.749
No one chooses to watch their friends die.

01:28:37.751 --> 01:28:41.253
You think I choose to hear
them when I close my eyes?

01:28:41.255 --> 01:28:43.355
You enlisted again.

01:28:43.357 --> 01:28:44.456
You chose it.

01:28:44.458 --> 01:28:45.991
Where were you?

01:28:48.461 --> 01:28:52.764
I distinctly remember you saying
you'd be right behind me!

01:28:55.034 --> 01:28:56.401
Where were you!

01:28:58.438 --> 01:28:59.738
Say it!

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:00.972
I couldn't do it, man.

01:29:00.974 --> 01:29:02.808
I couldn't kill my person for that.

01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:04.976
You were afraid.

01:29:04.978 --> 01:29:06.511
Maybe you do think it was wrong now,

01:29:06.513 --> 01:29:09.948
but you were afraid then, and
that's why you weren't there.

01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:12.784
That's why you feel so guilty.

01:29:12.786 --> 01:29:14.453
While you were doing keg stands,

01:29:14.455 --> 01:29:16.555
and fucking that pretty
little girlfriend of yours,

01:29:16.557 --> 01:29:17.723
you know what I was doing?

01:29:17.725 --> 01:29:18.657
I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

01:29:18.659 --> 01:29:20.092
Defending your country.

01:29:20.094 --> 01:29:21.860
Protecting this place.

01:29:21.862 --> 01:29:23.328
A place you didn't earn.

01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:25.897
Then why are you so broken?

01:29:26.799 --> 01:29:28.467
I'm not broken.

01:29:28.469 --> 01:29:29.901
I think you can't deal
with what you've done,

01:29:29.903 --> 01:29:31.136
and it fucking kills you.

01:29:31.138 --> 01:29:32.070
And what have I done?

01:29:32.072 --> 01:29:33.605
You killed people, man.

01:29:33.607 --> 01:29:35.440
You murdered people

01:29:35.442 --> 01:29:39.578
for something that you didn't believe in.

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.513
You think I murdered people?

01:29:41.515 --> 01:29:42.948
What else do you call
killing another person

01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:44.249
for something you don't believe in?

01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:45.917
Oh, please.

01:29:45.919 --> 01:29:48.186
All that political bullshit
goes right out the window

01:29:48.188 --> 01:29:49.988
the minute, the fucking second,

01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:54.025
someone is trying to kill
you, or your friends.

01:29:54.027 --> 01:29:55.460
I didn't murder them.

01:29:55.462 --> 01:29:58.029
I stopped them from killing
people I cared about!

01:29:58.031 --> 01:30:00.565
It was us, versus them!

01:30:00.567 --> 01:30:03.001
We just, we just wanted to stay alive, man.

01:30:03.003 --> 01:30:05.637
There's no time to think
about anything else.

01:30:05.639 --> 01:30:06.505
So you save people?

01:30:06.507 --> 01:30:07.539
You're a hero?

01:30:07.541 --> 01:30:08.907
No.

01:30:08.909 --> 01:30:10.976
Heroes don't come home.

01:30:14.714 --> 01:30:16.982
Man, I should've been there with you,

01:30:16.984 --> 01:30:19.384
and for that, I'm sorry.

01:30:19.386 --> 01:30:21.787
That is my greatest regret.

01:30:23.322 --> 01:30:24.856
If I could have that moment back,

01:30:24.858 --> 01:30:27.492
I would do it so differently.

01:30:27.494 --> 01:30:32.063
But I don't regret not getting
pulled into that bullshit.

01:30:32.065 --> 01:30:33.198
And you think I do?

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:34.699
You should!

01:30:34.701 --> 01:30:36.435
You are fucking something else.

01:30:36.437 --> 01:30:38.437
What did you expect?

01:30:38.439 --> 01:30:40.772
That I was gonna worship you and
thank you for your service?

01:30:40.774 --> 01:30:41.740
I never asked for that.

01:30:41.742 --> 01:30:42.808
Huh, does that piss you off?

01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:44.242
That I don't shake your hand,

01:30:44.244 --> 01:30:45.777
and thank you for
everything you sacrificed?

01:30:45.779 --> 01:30:47.379
You got the freedom to say
whatever the fuck you want!

01:30:47.381 --> 01:30:49.815
Cut the canned bullshit, man!

01:30:49.817 --> 01:30:50.649
I know you!

01:30:50.651 --> 01:30:51.616
You don't know me.

01:30:51.618 --> 01:30:52.584
I know it pisses you off!

01:30:52.586 --> 01:30:53.718
I can see it in your eyes.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.253
I'm an ungrateful fuck.

01:30:55.255 --> 01:30:57.556
Sorry if I didn't want to get
dragged into that bullshit.

01:30:57.558 --> 01:31:00.025
Why don't you tell my dead friends that?

01:31:00.027 --> 01:31:01.460
You volunteered!

01:31:01.462 --> 01:31:03.595
You signed your name down
on a piece of paper!

01:31:03.597 --> 01:31:05.864
At what point do you become
a willing participant

01:31:05.866 --> 01:31:07.466
in something that you know is wrong?

01:31:07.468 --> 01:31:09.301
By the time I re-upped, do you really think

01:31:09.303 --> 01:31:12.571
I gave a shit about why we were there?

01:31:12.573 --> 01:31:15.407
I wanted to make sure
that the 17 year old kid

01:31:15.409 --> 01:31:18.043
with a 90 IQ, the guy who joined

01:31:18.045 --> 01:31:20.479
because he wanted to protect his country

01:31:20.481 --> 01:31:23.748
got to come back home to his mom and dad.

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:25.817
And if I didn't go, somewhat who wasn't

01:31:25.819 --> 01:31:27.285
as good as me, would've.

01:31:27.287 --> 01:31:28.753
That doesn't justify this killing!

01:31:28.755 --> 01:31:31.256
Do you realize how fucking
ridiculous that sounds!

01:31:31.258 --> 01:31:33.091
Soldiers go where you ask us to go!

01:31:33.093 --> 01:31:35.927
We are a tool, a concept
you refuse to understand!

01:31:35.929 --> 01:31:36.995
I understand it!

01:31:36.997 --> 01:31:38.263
Do you?

01:31:38.265 --> 01:31:39.498
Or do you just like refuse to process...

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:40.732
awful easy to say coming from the safety

01:31:40.734 --> 01:31:42.367
of your suburban home, where people

01:31:42.369 --> 01:31:43.668
aren't killing your friends!

01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:45.036
It's not that simple!

01:31:45.038 --> 01:31:46.505
You put yourself in the situation

01:31:46.507 --> 01:31:48.173
where you had to kill somebody

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:49.908
for something you didn't even believe in!

01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:51.510
I couldn't do that!

01:31:51.512 --> 01:31:53.612
Yeah, I would have trouble
sleeping at night, too.

01:32:05.324 --> 01:32:06.358
You done?

01:32:28.915 --> 01:32:29.848
Enough Ben!

01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:30.582
I don't want to hurt you!

01:32:56.075 --> 01:32:57.042
Fucker.

01:33:01.414 --> 01:33:03.281
I'll fucking kill you.

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:51.563
You're a scrappy mother fucker, aren't you?

01:33:55.234 --> 01:33:57.168
I was fighting for my life.

01:35:13.713 --> 01:35:15.780
When I was over there

01:35:17.983 --> 01:35:20.285
I kept turning on the news

01:35:21.954 --> 01:35:24.923
expecting to see people protesting

01:35:25.958 --> 01:35:28.693
trying to bring us home, you know?

01:35:30.296 --> 01:35:32.097
You know what I saw?

01:35:33.532 --> 01:35:36.167
Survivor, fucking Kardashians.

01:35:43.476 --> 01:35:46.444
Did you once try to bring me home?

01:35:47.446 --> 01:35:48.646
Man, I can't sleep at night,

01:35:48.648 --> 01:35:51.850
and I probably never really will.

01:35:51.852 --> 01:35:53.318
While the rest of the country curls up

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.353
in their Egyptian cotton sheets,

01:35:55.355 --> 01:35:57.255
and their cozy, gas-heated homes.

01:35:57.257 --> 01:36:00.892
And they get to dream
about fucking sugarplums.

01:36:00.894 --> 01:36:04.629
The price of our way of life is not shared.

01:36:05.598 --> 01:36:07.565
I know I'm not a hero.

01:36:09.435 --> 01:36:11.936
No sane person comes back
from that fucked-up nightmare

01:36:11.938 --> 01:36:14.472
proud of everything they did.

01:36:14.474 --> 01:36:17.242
All I could do was one thing,

01:36:17.244 --> 01:36:19.878
and that's keep my guys alive.

01:36:22.381 --> 01:36:23.348
And I did.

01:36:36.095 --> 01:36:37.395
So what now?

01:36:56.949 --> 01:36:57.916
Oh fuck.

01:37:03.789 --> 01:37:06.424
Still feels like it's there.

01:37:08.527 --> 01:37:10.495
IUD got us in a hum-v.

01:37:10.497 --> 01:37:14.132
It was fucking.

01:37:15.568 --> 01:37:19.504
Worst part is, I swear I have
a huge blister on my big toe!

01:37:19.506 --> 01:37:22.407
But when I looked down, nothing.

01:37:22.409 --> 01:37:23.908
No foot, no shin!

01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:26.544
My whole god damn leg is gone!

01:37:31.150 --> 01:37:34.085
I had the coolest fucking
tattoo on my calf.

01:37:34.087 --> 01:37:36.020
400 bucks fucking wasted.

01:37:36.022 --> 01:37:40.325
That shit pissed me off.

01:37:42.228 --> 01:37:44.529
So, so go to colleges.

01:37:44.531 --> 01:37:45.530
I mean tell your story.

01:37:45.532 --> 01:37:47.498
Call out the hypocrites.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.666
Come on, Benson.

01:37:48.668 --> 01:37:50.034
A room full of teenagers and listen to them

01:37:50.036 --> 01:37:53.504
talk about shit they know nothing about?

01:37:54.607 --> 01:37:55.874
No thanks.

01:37:55.876 --> 01:37:57.342
These kids were four when 9/11 happened.

01:37:57.344 --> 01:38:01.212
It's about as meaningful as
saying Pearl harbor, to them.

01:38:15.361 --> 01:38:18.563
If you're not gonna tell
them, then who will?

01:38:18.565 --> 01:38:20.965
I'm the enemy, man.

01:38:20.967 --> 01:38:22.433
I'm the machine.

01:38:23.736 --> 01:38:27.605
They'll never hear me even
if I did say something.

01:38:32.878 --> 01:38:36.014
But you know what I would tell them?

01:38:37.416 --> 01:38:39.117
That it's criminal.

01:38:41.287 --> 01:38:43.187
That hero shit.

01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:47.225
When a life gets snuffed
out like it's nothing.

01:38:50.029 --> 01:38:51.296
Imagine growing up so poor

01:38:51.298 --> 01:38:54.098
where your only chance for a better life

01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:56.834
requires you to gamble with it.

01:38:58.470 --> 01:39:00.171
And for what?

01:39:00.173 --> 01:39:02.373
Free college tuition, or
to protect their country?

01:39:02.375 --> 01:39:03.841
Which one is it?

01:39:04.576 --> 01:39:07.378
That is what's fucking criminal.

01:39:10.883 --> 01:39:13.851
They don't want to be heroes, man.

01:39:15.054 --> 01:39:17.455
They just want a chance.

01:39:17.457 --> 01:39:19.257
They want adventure.

01:39:20.259 --> 01:39:21.960
Wars destroy lives.

01:39:24.129 --> 01:39:26.097
It shreds friendships.

01:39:27.166 --> 01:39:30.568
It's not cool, it's not bad-ass,

01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:34.138
there's no fast cars, no hot chicks.

01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:36.841
And all the heroes fucking die.

01:39:39.545 --> 01:39:42.680
But you know what I wonder the most?

01:39:44.483 --> 01:39:46.484
Is who I would've been.

01:40:38.904 --> 01:40:41.439
You feel good about yourself?

01:40:43.442 --> 01:40:44.809
You beat up a cripple.

01:40:46.613 --> 01:40:48.346
A god damn amputee!

01:40:55.254 --> 01:40:56.921
Hey, you remember that time

01:40:56.923 --> 01:40:58.423
we drove up here with your dad?

01:40:58.425 --> 01:40:59.390
In the back of the pick-up?

01:40:59.392 --> 01:41:00.925
Dude, those puddles were huge!

01:41:00.927 --> 01:41:02.427
Downright dangerous.

01:41:02.429 --> 01:41:03.761
We could've been killed
before our balls dropped.

01:41:03.763 --> 01:41:05.530
Yeah, I'm surprised they did that.

01:41:05.532 --> 01:41:06.998
You know, you weren't the only one.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.534
We were all very concerned about
those lopsided little guys.

01:41:09.536 --> 01:41:10.568
Whatever came of the left one?

01:41:10.570 --> 01:41:11.736
Oh, it's still crooked,

01:41:11.738 --> 01:41:12.937
and way higher than the other one.

01:41:12.939 --> 01:41:14.238
Can you still pull it up inside your body?

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:15.106
Hell yeah, man!

01:41:17.143 --> 01:41:18.476
Oh, fuck.

01:41:18.478 --> 01:41:20.845
Jesus, what happened to your face?

01:41:20.847 --> 01:41:22.914
What's wrong with my face?

01:41:24.184 --> 01:41:25.116
No seriously, what's wrong with my face?

01:41:25.118 --> 01:41:26.751
It looks better than before.

01:41:45.204 --> 01:41:49.307
Does anybody even pick
up hitchhikers anymore?

01:41:49.309 --> 01:41:52.743
Rapists and murderers, I think.

01:41:52.745 --> 01:41:53.578
Perfect.

01:42:31.484 --> 01:42:32.683
Just in case.
