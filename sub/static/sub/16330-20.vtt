01:36.062 --> 01:38.930
- No, not really.
- Was it the radiator?

01:38.955 --> 01:40.937
I need to get that thing fixed.

01:40.962 --> 01:43.374
When are you gonna tell Weller

01:51.263 --> 01:54.293

You've proven yourself to the team

01:56.479 --> 01:58.427
and Weller trusts you now

01:58.452 --> 02:01.195
and he fought... so hard
to get you out of the cell.

02:42.448 --> 02:44.406
and some of my lab techs are new

02:44.431 --> 02:47.125
and it's just easier
to do things myself.

02:47.150 --> 02:50.199
Part of being a leader is
learning how to trust your team

02:50.224 --> 02:52.057
and learning how to delegate.

02:52.082 --> 02:54.480
Everything needs to be done right

02:54.505 --> 02:56.505
and we can't afford to
make any more mistakes.

02:56.530 --> 02:58.837
What we can't afford
is having you burn out.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.851
I'm sorry.

03:02.876 --> 03:04.839
It won't happen again.

03:07.631 --> 03:09.289
Patterson, wait.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.723
I know this just isn't a case anymore.

03:14.748 --> 03:18.492
This is personal for all of us.

03:19.224 --> 03:22.410
We have to start looking
after ourselves and each other.

03:22.435 --> 03:25.128
Otherwise, we don't stand
a chance against them.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.668
So I booked an appointment
for you tonight to see Dr. Sun,

03:31.094 --> 03:33.977

I'm on my way to see her now.

03:46.798 --> 03:49.734
How's the new living situation going?

03:49.759 --> 03:53.757
Good. Uh, I'm a little
concerned about Roman.

03:53.782 --> 03:56.062
I mean, he goes from
the safe house to therapy

03:56.064 --> 03:58.298
and back home again every single day.

03:58.323 --> 03:59.409
He's out of his cage

03:59.434 --> 04:02.378
but he's not exactly out in the world.

04:03.354 --> 04:05.527
Why don't you guys come
over for dinner tonight?

04:05.552 --> 04:07.919
I can make my famous Thai curry.

04:08.801 --> 04:10.167
Yeah, okay.

04:10.192 --> 04:13.091

My team's been piecing together

06:21.212 --> 06:24.432
the shredded documents
from Sandstorm's forger.

06:24.457 --> 06:26.148
We got another name.

06:26.173 --> 06:28.974
Devon Penberthy, arrested and placed

06:28.999 --> 06:31.032
in county jail two weeks ago

06:31.057 --> 06:33.057
for transporting weapons
across state lines.

06:33.086 --> 06:34.368
Presumably for Sandstorm.

06:34.393 --> 06:37.253
Which means Devon might know what
Sandstorm plans on using them for.

06:37.278 --> 06:39.005
All right, so this is our
chance to get intel from someone

06:39.030 --> 06:40.723
who's been in the fold.

06:40.747 --> 06:43.352
- Let's bring her in.
- No, wait.

06:43.377 --> 06:45.485
If she's Sandstorm,
she's not gonna talk.

06:45.510 --> 06:47.519
You got a better idea?

06:48.119 --> 06:50.627
Let me go undercover, get close to her.

06:50.652 --> 06:52.289
If Devon is in Shepherd's inner circle,

06:52.291 --> 06:55.158
she'll know who you are
and what you look like.

06:55.486 --> 06:57.307
Put me in, Coach.

06:57.612 --> 07:00.013
No. The same goes for you.

07:00.038 --> 07:02.433
Yeah, but there is less of a
chance and it's worth the risk.

07:02.435 --> 07:05.299
We've got to stop playing defense
if we want to get ahead of them.

07:08.978 --> 07:12.205
All right, but we have
to take major precautions.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.643
I want you to get Tasha a false ID

07:13.668 --> 07:15.560
with rock-solid backstopping...

07:16.220 --> 07:18.734
and some way to be able to call out.

07:18.759 --> 07:20.384
I'll get you a burner phone,

07:20.408 --> 07:22.484
but you're gonna have to smuggle it in.

07:23.222 --> 07:24.750
Got it.

07:24.775 --> 07:28.076
Tasha, you're gonna be in there alone

07:28.101 --> 07:30.406
with a lot of dangerous criminals.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.084
No gun,

07:32.109 --> 07:34.842
no badge, no backup.

07:34.867 --> 07:37.554
No one can know we're doing this.

07:37.579 --> 07:39.706
Not even the cops that arrest me.

07:42.226 --> 07:44.482
We gave you ways to
call out for a reason.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.493
You should have contacted
us the minute that happened.

07:47.518 --> 07:49.163
I started the fight.

07:49.850 --> 07:51.690
It's part of my plan to
get in tight with Devon.

07:51.715 --> 07:54.141
- You can't take risks like that.
- I was in total control.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.908
I could have put them all
on the floor if I wanted.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.210
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

07:57.212 --> 07:58.729
So, what about the next time?

07:58.754 --> 08:00.187
What about when there's more of them?

08:00.212 --> 08:01.734

08:06.078 --> 08:08.492
This isn't just any op.

08:13.340 --> 08:15.056
You pull me out now,

we'll never get close to
her again, and you know it.

08:18.786 --> 08:21.440

That's all I'm asking.

I figured I'd install...

12:28.114 --> 12:30.584
You figured you'd lock up

12:30.609 --> 12:33.279
half my computers for a day?

12:34.982 --> 12:36.622
Everything okay?

12:37.688 --> 12:39.423
Yeah, it's fine.

12:39.903 --> 12:42.270
Okay, so Zapata used her burner phone

12:42.272 --> 12:43.705
to send me some intel on Devon

12:43.707 --> 12:46.003
and I found a gun range
in the White Mountains

12:46.028 --> 12:47.695
that lines up with Devon's story.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.134
It's owned by Wes Hartley,

12:50.159 --> 12:52.062
55, substantial rap sheet.

12:52.087 --> 12:54.085
Shouldn't be anywhere near a firearm

12:54.110 --> 12:55.317
yet owns a shooting range.

12:55.319 --> 12:57.274
Any recent ties between
Hartley and Devon?

12:57.299 --> 12:59.499
Nothing on paper, but I get the vibe

12:59.524 --> 13:02.084
he's not a paperwork kind of guy.

13:02.109 --> 13:03.943
Zapata also mentioned that Devon met

13:03.945 --> 13:06.152
her longtime boyfriend at the range.

13:06.177 --> 13:08.066
You think it could be Hartley?

13:08.091 --> 13:10.749
I mean, that would be a pretty
serious May-December romance,

13:10.751 --> 13:12.351
but anything's possible.

13:12.353 --> 13:15.213
You know, Devon was
arrested for moving arms,

13:15.238 --> 13:18.414
so maybe she was getting weapons
for Sandstorm from this guy.

13:18.439 --> 13:19.805
Get a team to bring him in

13:19.807 --> 13:21.755
and tell 'em to use extreme caution.

13:21.780 --> 13:23.367
We have to keep him in custody.

13:23.392 --> 13:25.531
If he does have
connections to Sandstorm,

13:25.556 --> 13:27.812
I don't want him tipping them off.

13:34.595 --> 13:36.453
(Weller) You recognize her?

13:37.562 --> 13:39.687
Sure. That's Stella.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.164
Can you tell me her full name?

13:41.189 --> 13:43.021
Stella was just a nickname I gave her.

13:43.046 --> 13:44.277
Don't recall her real one.

13:44.279 --> 13:46.079
She used to work for me off the books.

13:46.081 --> 13:47.603
When was the last time you saw her?

13:47.628 --> 13:49.149
About six years.

13:49.174 --> 13:51.507
Would you say that your relationship

13:51.532 --> 13:53.933
was purely professional?

13:54.200 --> 13:56.035
If you're asking me if
I slept with a teenager

13:56.037 --> 13:58.557
eight years ago, the answer is no.

13:58.582 --> 14:01.152
I have a wife who
wouldn't appreciate that.

14:01.419 --> 14:02.948
In fact, the reason she quit is,

14:02.973 --> 14:04.733
she got hot and heavy
with her boyfriend.

14:04.735 --> 14:06.578
I think they moved
away together someplace.

14:06.603 --> 14:09.462
- Do you remember his name?
- No, but...

14:09.791 --> 14:11.328
he had a face you couldn't forget.

14:11.353 --> 14:14.398
Real skinny and pale, cold blue eyes.

14:14.423 --> 14:16.267
Hell of a sniper, though.

14:16.292 --> 14:18.408
He used to come by the range sometimes.

14:20.691 --> 14:22.370
Is that him?

14:22.395 --> 14:24.150
Yeah, that's him.

14:24.175 --> 14:26.401
(Jane) That's Parker. He
was never far from Shepherd

14:26.426 --> 14:28.137
when I was at the compound.

14:28.139 --> 14:30.173
Do you have any idea what role he plays?

14:30.198 --> 14:32.775
No, but with Roman
and Borden out of play,

14:32.777 --> 14:35.967
I'm guessing he's gotten a lot
higher up on the food chain.

14:35.992 --> 14:37.525
According to Zapata's intel,

14:37.550 --> 14:40.216
Devon's been dating the
same guy for seven years.

14:40.241 --> 14:42.282
All right, so if Devon's with Parker

14:42.307 --> 14:44.687
and he's a key Sandstorm member,

14:44.712 --> 14:47.058
that makes her a lot more
valuable than we thought.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.409
This could be the break that we need.

14:48.434 --> 14:50.439
Patterson, get a word
to Tasha on the burner.

14:50.464 --> 14:51.641
It's a new plan.

14:51.643 --> 14:54.354
We've got to get to
Parker through Devon.

14:56.292 --> 14:57.706
When's the last time you talked to him,

14:57.708 --> 14:59.307
your boyfriend?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.940
- The day I got arrested.
- He doesn't visit?

15:01.965 --> 15:03.847
It's complicated.

15:03.849 --> 15:06.222
He can't get mixed up in this.

15:06.247 --> 15:09.128
Yeah, I get it.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.417
Listen, I have a phone if
you ever want to call him.

15:15.793 --> 15:17.651
How the hell did you get that?

15:17.676 --> 15:20.168
My cousin was in here for about a year.

15:20.193 --> 15:22.486
She got a little friendly
with one of the COs.

15:22.511 --> 15:24.511

- Heads up.

out now, all right?

15:52.296 --> 15:54.195
I'll make a deal, get
her charges dropped.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.630
Once she's out, we can
track her back to Parker.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.637

bail, awaiting trial.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.414
(Devon) We could check
into a motel somewhere.

24:39.439 --> 24:41.018
(Zapata) With what money?

24:41.627 --> 24:43.697
The first place they're gonna
look around here are motels.

24:43.722 --> 24:45.855
What about your boyfriend?
Can he hook us up?

24:45.880 --> 24:48.814
No. No, they're watching him like crazy.

24:51.154 --> 24:52.653
I know a place,

24:53.581 --> 24:55.649
somewhere off the grid.

25:00.310 --> 25:02.872
I told Roman that I know about Emma.

25:03.685 --> 25:05.637
I know you're angry,

25:05.662 --> 25:07.690
but be angry at me.

25:07.693 --> 25:09.560
This wasn't his fault.

25:10.458 --> 25:12.927
Roman wants me to be angry at him

25:13.332 --> 25:15.695
and you want me to be angry at you.

25:15.697 --> 25:19.073
Don't worry. I've got
enough for both of you.

25:19.098 --> 25:21.575
Roman is destroyed by what he did.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.871
You and I both know he's
not the same person now,

25:24.873 --> 25:27.075
just like I'm not the same person.

25:28.137 --> 25:30.340
You were able to look past
the things that I had done

25:30.365 --> 25:33.409
before I came to the FBI.

25:33.434 --> 25:36.012
I'm asking you to try to find a way

25:36.037 --> 25:38.364
to give Roman that same shot.

25:42.716 --> 25:44.537
When Emma died,

25:45.912 --> 25:49.177
I felt like there was no one left...

25:49.662 --> 25:54.201
that missed Taylor as much as I do.

25:55.981 --> 25:58.146
Emma was the only person

25:58.787 --> 26:01.193
that never told me to move on.

26:03.076 --> 26:06.021
She never told me to stop searching.

26:08.552 --> 26:12.939
And now, to find out she was killed

26:12.964 --> 26:15.341
because of her connection to me...

26:18.910 --> 26:21.477
I know exactly how that feels.

26:26.366 --> 26:28.775
It's just another part of my life

26:28.800 --> 26:32.839
that's been manipulated and destroyed...

26:32.864 --> 26:34.766
by Shepherd.

26:36.113 --> 26:37.956
We're gonna get her,

26:38.307 --> 26:39.644
and when we do,

26:39.669 --> 26:43.641
we're going to get every
last answer we deserve.

26:52.025 --> 26:53.767
Damn it.

26:53.792 --> 26:56.009
- We've got to get you to a doctor.
- I'm fine.

26:56.034 --> 26:58.591
- You're bleeding out.
- I can't exactly walk into an ER.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.884
Okay, I get it. You're trying
to protect your boyfriend.

27:00.909 --> 27:03.150
Is there someone else you could call?

27:04.270 --> 27:06.158
If something happens,
how is he gonna feel

27:06.183 --> 27:08.437
knowing he could have done something?

27:08.439 --> 27:11.595
We broke out of jail to see
the people we love again.

27:12.326 --> 27:13.659
<i>Right?</i>

27:15.190 --> 27:17.724
(dialing)

27:17.749 --> 27:19.350
(line ringing)

27:19.352 --> 27:22.553
Parker, it's me. I got out.

27:22.991 --> 27:24.718
No, I escaped.

27:26.093 --> 27:27.523
A friend.

27:29.001 --> 27:31.711
I didn't want to call
you, but we need help.

27:31.736 --> 27:34.705
I'm hurt. We're going south on 495.

27:34.729 --> 27:37.069
- (Parker) <i>How bad is the injury?</i>
- (Devon) <i>It's pretty deep.</i>

27:37.094 --> 27:38.804
I just ripped my
stitches. It's not good.

27:38.829 --> 27:40.132
(Parker) <i>I'm getting
on the road right now.</i>

27:40.157 --> 27:42.515
<i>Meet me in the parking lot
of Lenny's Deli off Route 33.</i>

27:42.995 --> 27:45.111
(Devon) <i>Hopefully we make it.</i>
<i>This car should be scrapped.</i>

27:45.152 --> 27:46.880
<i>It's such a piece of junk.</i>

27:46.905 --> 27:49.145
- (Parker) <i>Have faith.</i>
- Okay.

27:49.757 --> 27:51.457
I love you.

27:53.027 --> 27:54.226
(ends call)

27:54.228 --> 27:55.772
- Patterson.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

27:55.797 --> 27:57.905
I want you to send
undercover units to the deli.

27:57.930 --> 28:00.499
Tell 'em they have to use extreme
caution. This could be a trap.

28:00.501 --> 28:02.684
- On it.
- <i>No one is to use deadly force.</i>

28:02.709 --> 28:05.768
It is crucial we take
Parker and Devon alive.

28:05.793 --> 28:08.674
- Copy that.
- Parker's still hanging around here.

28:08.676 --> 28:10.601
That means Shepherd
might be close as well.

28:11.293 --> 28:13.278
Are we taking the scenic route?

28:13.280 --> 28:16.301
No. We're making a stop.

28:16.326 --> 28:19.293
We don't have time. The
cops'll be right behind us.

28:24.059 --> 28:25.934
They're stopping.

28:25.959 --> 28:27.526
Where?

28:27.551 --> 28:29.628
Looks like some kind
of scrap metal yard.

28:29.630 --> 28:32.197
Something's up. How close are we?

28:32.199 --> 28:33.778
About two miles.

28:36.335 --> 28:38.077
(Devon) That's my boyfriend.

28:40.590 --> 28:42.641
I thought you said he was
meeting us at the deli.

28:42.643 --> 28:45.668
I used a code in case the
phone was being tapped.

28:45.693 --> 28:47.215
This scrapyard has been
abandoned for years.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.243
We used to always pass it
on the way into the city.

28:49.268 --> 28:51.328
I knew he'd know what I meant.

28:53.387 --> 28:54.820
(car door closes)

28:54.845 --> 28:57.133
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:07.542 --> 29:09.677
Parker, this is Riva.

29:10.337 --> 29:12.175
Special Agent Zapata.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.143
- What?
- You're a Fed?

29:15.168 --> 29:16.510
No, not just any Fed.

29:16.535 --> 29:18.063
She was assigned to Remi's case.

29:18.088 --> 29:19.731
This was a setup.

29:19.756 --> 29:22.390
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

29:24.285 --> 29:26.985
(groaning)

29:37.575 --> 29:38.950
(tires squealing)

29:45.350 --> 29:47.215
There's no one here.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.591
Patterson.

29:48.616 --> 29:49.809
Weller?

29:49.834 --> 29:52.535
Tasha's gone. All right,
they must have taken her.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.979
Notify agents in the surrounding area.

29:55.004 --> 29:56.954
Check all the traffic cams.

29:56.979 --> 29:59.270
Uh, should I mobilize air support?

29:59.295 --> 30:01.191
No. All right, we've got to be subtle.

30:01.192 --> 30:03.541
We can't put Tasha in more
danger than she's already in.

30:03.543 --> 30:05.104
We couldn't find the
cell phone in the car,

30:05.129 --> 30:06.393
but maybe she took it with her.

30:06.418 --> 30:07.979
Are you getting any kind of signal?

30:08.011 --> 30:09.854
I was, but it went dead.

30:10.143 --> 30:12.301
All right. So, which
direction were they going?

30:12.303 --> 30:15.494
Uh, east on 33. I sent
a team out already.

30:15.519 --> 30:16.705
All right, we're heading that way.

30:16.730 --> 30:19.096
And Patterson, try to turn
that phone on remotely.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.197
It's Tasha's only lifeline.

30:24.449 --> 30:26.883
(Devon) I should have known when
she tried to get close to me.

30:26.885 --> 30:29.765
It doesn't matter now.
We're gonna flip this.

30:29.790 --> 30:31.038
Weller wants his teammate back,

30:31.063 --> 30:32.598
Shepherd wants Weller,

30:32.623 --> 30:34.984
and now we use her to get to Weller.

30:36.380 --> 30:39.014
(static)

30:39.187 --> 30:40.914
No.

30:40.939 --> 30:44.252
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No!

30:44.913 --> 30:46.468
Stuart,

30:47.923 --> 30:49.424
do you want to tell me

30:49.426 --> 30:51.655
why my computer crashed again?

30:51.680 --> 30:53.726
I know, I know. It's the OS update.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.317
It's causing all sorts of glitches.

30:55.342 --> 30:57.776
- You said the update just came out.
- Yeah.

30:57.801 --> 31:00.508
We never do a full install

31:00.533 --> 31:03.640
until we run a bug check first.

31:04.116 --> 31:06.795
Sorry. I... I didn't
know. It was my first...

31:06.820 --> 31:08.734
- Agent Patterson!
- Who do you work for?

31:08.759 --> 31:09.898
What?

31:09.923 --> 31:12.614
You disabled half the
computers in my lab.

31:12.616 --> 31:14.538
- What are you doing here?
- Please, please, you're hurting me.

31:14.563 --> 31:16.773
- Who do you work for?
- I work for you!

31:16.798 --> 31:18.601
All right, I know I screwed up.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.459
It won't happen again.

31:26.473 --> 31:29.064
Uh, sorry. Keep working.

31:29.817 --> 31:32.464
Patterson, what have you got for us?

31:32.489 --> 31:35.106
Actually, this is Stuart,

31:35.131 --> 31:36.526
one of the lab techs.

31:36.551 --> 31:38.075
Where's Patterson, Stuart?

31:38.100 --> 31:39.700
She had to step away,

31:39.725 --> 31:41.301
but there was an alert
that you should know about.

31:41.326 --> 31:43.422
Agent Zapata's cell was
turned back on briefly

31:43.447 --> 31:45.080
just long enough for us to trace it.

31:45.082 --> 31:46.648
She's sending up a flare.

31:46.650 --> 31:49.020
- What's the address, Stuart?
- 219 Prospect Way,

31:49.045 --> 31:50.919
an abandoned warehouse in the Bronx.

31:50.921 --> 31:52.598
I've got the blueprints.
I'm sending them now.

31:52.623 --> 31:54.990
It's a big space.
Multiple points of entry.

31:54.992 --> 31:56.270
Two levels.

31:56.295 --> 31:57.981
Looks like there's a group of silos

31:58.006 --> 32:00.048
leading up to the second floor.

32:03.372 --> 32:04.900
When backup arrives,

32:04.902 --> 32:07.294
I want you to take Beta
Team and clear the silos.

32:07.319 --> 32:10.505
- You don't want to enter together?
- No, it's better this way.

32:10.935 --> 32:13.294
You're the only one
that I trust out there.

32:20.138 --> 32:22.317
(tires squealing)

32:22.319 --> 32:25.615
♪ ♪

32:29.225 --> 32:31.961
Clear the silos. Cherny,
you're up top with me.

32:33.295 --> 32:36.129
All right, just remember, no kill shots.

32:36.131 --> 32:38.086
Take all suspects alive.

32:38.111 --> 32:39.359
Move.

32:46.758 --> 32:50.010
Two left, two right, two with me.

33:01.490 --> 33:02.589
(Zapata) Weller!

33:02.591 --> 33:05.790
(panting)

33:08.675 --> 33:10.212
Bomb!

33:15.290 --> 33:18.478
Tasha, this is rigged
to a pressure plate.

33:18.503 --> 33:19.869
You try to get off it,

33:19.894 --> 33:22.152
it'll set off the bomb, okay?

33:22.177 --> 33:25.033
They knocked me out. I
don't know where they went.

33:26.103 --> 33:27.251
Gun!

33:46.647 --> 33:48.213
FBI!

33:53.665 --> 33:55.509
All right, keep us covered!

33:56.350 --> 33:58.316
I need to get you off that thing.

33:59.814 --> 34:01.133
Here.

34:16.300 --> 34:18.402
I'm gonna drag this
fridge onto that plate.

34:18.427 --> 34:20.085
You think I weigh as much as a fridge?

34:20.088 --> 34:21.920
Do you see a mini fridge around here?

34:21.922 --> 34:23.042
It'll do.

34:23.067 --> 34:25.661
All right. Okay.

34:27.042 --> 34:29.425
Now, when I place this onto that plate,

34:29.864 --> 34:32.447
you jump up and move.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.706
Any objections?

34:35.237 --> 34:36.768
Nope.

34:37.112 --> 34:40.464
3, 2, 1...

34:40.489 --> 34:41.761
Go!

34:42.096 --> 34:43.609
(groaning)

34:47.315 --> 34:50.112
Okay, I guess I weigh
as much as a fridge.

34:54.864 --> 34:56.688
(groaning)

35:01.766 --> 35:05.100
(groaning)

35:26.841 --> 35:28.708
- Devon, no!
- (whistles)

35:34.562 --> 35:36.202
It's over.

35:37.118 --> 35:38.632
We got 'em.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.894
We know you're in
Shepherd's inner circle.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.228
We know that you're
involved in the ambush

35:55.253 --> 35:57.587
that left 12 FBI agents dead.

35:57.612 --> 35:59.174
Devon is gonna go down with you

35:59.199 --> 36:01.048
unless you start talking to me.

36:02.672 --> 36:04.323
Nothing?

36:07.425 --> 36:10.416
Both of you are never gonna
see the light of day again,

36:10.441 --> 36:12.066
you understand?

36:19.972 --> 36:22.466
We just have to keep chipping away.

36:22.491 --> 36:24.958
- He'll tire out.
- He's never gonna talk.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.193
Yes, he will. We'll
break him eventually.

36:27.218 --> 36:29.694
Turn off the cameras. I'll
have him singing in 30 seconds.

36:29.719 --> 36:32.037
No. If we do that, we're
no better than them.

36:32.062 --> 36:33.936
I've got no problem giving
up my gold star in heaven

36:33.961 --> 36:35.585
if it means finding out what
the hell they're planning

36:35.610 --> 36:36.749
and where Shepherd is.

36:36.774 --> 36:38.428
Tasha, I know that
you're angry, all right?

36:38.430 --> 36:41.198
- You've been to hell and back today.
- You're damn right I have.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.334
I put my life on the line out there

36:44.336 --> 36:47.194
and I just want to make sure
that it was worth something.

36:47.196 --> 36:50.517
I will be damned if we're
gonna let him sit there

36:50.542 --> 36:53.630
and smile when we know
he has all the answers.

36:53.655 --> 36:57.677
Tasha, we have to be strategic, okay?

36:57.702 --> 36:59.092
- No.
- Yes.

36:59.117 --> 37:00.917
We have to change the way we do things.

37:00.919 --> 37:03.997
That is the only way we
will get ahead of them.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.843
We play by our rules, not theirs.

37:05.868 --> 37:08.601
There are no rules, not
when it comes to Shepherd.

37:08.626 --> 37:11.628
Her people were trying to kill
you today, or did you miss that?

37:11.630 --> 37:14.226
So, whatever power of
protection she gave you

37:14.251 --> 37:16.288
seemed to have been revoked.

37:17.272 --> 37:19.147
That doesn't change the
fact there's a right way

37:19.172 --> 37:21.739
and there's a wrong
way to do things, Tasha.

37:24.498 --> 37:26.443
Today's incident at the lab,

37:26.445 --> 37:28.787
um, you accused one of your technicians.

37:28.812 --> 37:30.512
I... (groaning)

37:30.537 --> 37:32.647
I overreacted.

37:34.795 --> 37:37.662
I just... I had...

37:38.436 --> 37:41.233
I'm finding it hard to
trust people right now.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.394
Given what happened with Dr. Borden,

37:44.396 --> 37:45.811
the fact that you didn't realize

37:45.836 --> 37:47.764
he was working for Sandstorm,

37:47.766 --> 37:51.311
has that caused you to
question your judgment?

37:52.100 --> 37:54.155
Do you trust yourself?

37:55.483 --> 37:59.009
Do I trust myself?

37:59.675 --> 38:01.295
Uh...

38:03.319 --> 38:07.183
I second-guess myself

38:07.553 --> 38:11.022
every minute of every day.

38:13.506 --> 38:17.155
What Dr. Borden did was unforgivable,

38:17.725 --> 38:19.992
but it's not your fault.

38:20.232 --> 38:22.338
You need to put that to rest.

38:22.379 --> 38:24.686
What do you think I'm trying to do?

38:27.355 --> 38:30.769
After he shot me...

38:30.794 --> 38:31.998
and disappeared,

38:32.023 --> 38:35.014
I wanted to bring him in. I wanted to...

38:36.732 --> 38:40.373
I just... I wanted to make
him pay for what he did,

38:42.296 --> 38:45.444
just to get some kind
of closure, but he...

38:46.451 --> 38:48.858
he stole that from me.

38:49.897 --> 38:52.397
Dr. Borden is gone now.

38:54.170 --> 38:56.436
He can't hurt you anymore.

39:12.691 --> 39:15.753
Can we take a rain check on that dinner?

39:15.821 --> 39:17.417
Uh, yeah.

39:18.308 --> 39:20.416
Yeah, of course.

39:20.441 --> 39:23.670
Jane, I know that Roman

39:23.695 --> 39:27.097
isn't the same person who killed Emma,

39:27.754 --> 39:30.214
just like you're not the
same person who did...

39:30.239 --> 39:32.622
all of those things in your past,

39:33.269 --> 39:36.324
but I can't just flip a
switch and get over this.

39:37.346 --> 39:39.580
This one's personal.

39:42.741 --> 39:46.187
I wish I could change it, the past.

39:47.289 --> 39:50.420
I would do a lot of
things very differently.

39:51.218 --> 39:53.057
Me too.

39:54.977 --> 39:57.144
Good night, Jane.

39:58.223 --> 40:00.195
Good night, Kurt.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.302
Sorry I don't have anything stronger.

40:06.304 --> 40:08.452
No, I'm sorry.

40:09.117 --> 40:12.473
The last thing you need is me
coming over and bitching about work.

40:12.498 --> 40:15.099
I've just missed having
someone to talk to.

40:15.124 --> 40:16.579
You got Weller.

40:16.609 --> 40:20.927
Can anyone really talk
to Weller besides Jane?

40:20.952 --> 40:22.452
He's not exactly an open book,

40:22.454 --> 40:23.992
but the man, for sure,
still has our back.

40:24.017 --> 40:26.663
Yeah, with one hand tied behind his.

40:28.413 --> 40:31.882
If we want to win this war,
we have to shake things up.

40:33.641 --> 40:35.607
How do you plan on doing that?

40:35.632 --> 40:38.401
I'm just saying there is a world

40:38.403 --> 40:41.137
where we don't cross
every T and dot every I.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.890
Right, and whatever that world is,

40:43.915 --> 40:45.848
it's not the FBI.

40:53.874 --> 40:57.798
Hey. So, Weller said
he talked to you today.

40:57.823 --> 41:00.234
Yeah, we talked.

41:00.259 --> 41:03.296
Look, it's gonna take some time,

41:03.321 --> 41:05.693
but I think he'll come around.

41:05.718 --> 41:07.765
I'll take your word for it.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.569
(groaning)

41:10.665 --> 41:13.553
Damn it. I cut my finger.

41:13.578 --> 41:14.936
Well, go run it under some cold water.

41:14.961 --> 41:16.226
I'll grab the First Aid kit.

41:16.251 --> 41:17.952
It's fine. It really is.

41:22.686 --> 41:25.756
- Here, let me see.
- No, it's fine, really.

41:27.666 --> 41:29.099
Ooh.

41:29.616 --> 41:31.670
Here you go. It's gonna be okay.

41:31.695 --> 41:33.623
When you injected me with that drug,

41:33.625 --> 41:35.058
I got the chance to start over again,

41:35.060 --> 41:37.177
and now you will too.

41:37.202 --> 41:38.572
Aah!

41:44.167 --> 41:45.772
What is it?

41:46.631 --> 41:48.524
You lied to me.

41:48.549 --> 41:51.417
What? What are you talking about?

41:53.600 --> 41:55.423
You erased my memory.

41:56.084 --> 41:58.436
You, not Shepherd.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.272
I remember.

42:01.297 --> 42:03.387
Roman, please listen to me.

42:03.412 --> 42:05.233
You did this to me!

42:05.235 --> 42:07.020
Roman, listen to me, please.
