WEBVTT

00:08.720 --> 00:11.279
Our Father who art in heaven,

00:11.880 --> 00:14.320
hallowed be thy name.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.600
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

00:18.320 --> 00:20.800
on earth as it in heaven.

00:20.879 --> 00:23.359
Give us this day our daily bread

00:23.719 --> 00:26.280
and forgive us our trespasses

00:26.359 --> 00:29.039
as we forgive those
who trespass against us

00:29.800 --> 00:32.119
and lead us not into temptation,

00:32.960 --> 00:34.759
but deliver us from evil.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.360
How can I help you?

02:22.439 --> 02:24.800
I'm Carmelo Lo Diacono,
I want to turn myself in.

02:25.719 --> 02:28.599
I tried to kill a woman and her son.

02:31.039 --> 02:37.120
GOMORRA

03:06.479 --> 03:08.800
I know he was like a brother to you.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.400
He sacrificed himself for you,

03:11.960 --> 03:14.280
like Carmelo did for me.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.960
We're lucky,

03:16.039 --> 03:18.840
our people sacrifice themselves for us.

03:20.280 --> 03:23.520
Now's not the time
to be blinded by anger.

03:24.319 --> 03:26.680
I've never seen clearer than this.

03:27.639 --> 03:30.360
The result will be worth the price.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.479
I know it will.

03:33.159 --> 03:36.439
I'm not doing it just for me,
but for them as well.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.000
That's what I wanted to hear you say.

04:12.599 --> 04:15.439
It's as if he's been
sent to us from heaven.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.639
People like them don't come
from heaven, Bollano.

04:45.439 --> 04:46.600
"Carmelo Lo Diacono,

04:46.680 --> 04:51.399
member of the clan of
Vincenzo Carignano, aka the Gentleman,

04:51.480 --> 04:54.920
declares he attempted to murder
Azzurra and Pietro Savastano."

05:00.360 --> 05:03.800
Now tell me again exactly
how things unfolded.

05:03.879 --> 05:05.360
I already told you.

05:08.879 --> 05:12.000
The process of collaboration
is like a rosary,

05:12.079 --> 05:15.240
where the deeds you've committed
are the prayers.

05:15.319 --> 05:18.560
If you want absolution,
you have to repeat it over and over.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.519
After the Gentleman's murder,

05:24.600 --> 05:28.759
I participated in the ambush
against his killer's family.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.639
Why did you decide to testify?

05:45.079 --> 05:47.079
Because there was a kid

05:48.920 --> 05:50.720
and the kid could have died.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.600
I'd never forgive myself.

05:54.879 --> 05:57.399
A criminal with a conscience.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.360
- Who ordered that action?
- No one.

06:03.959 --> 06:05.920
Don Vincenzo was like a father to me.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.720
That scumbag Gennaro Savastano
had him killed.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.240
How do you know it was him?

06:14.680 --> 06:18.879
The Gentleman lived up to his name,
he was loved and respected by all.

06:19.839 --> 06:22.839
- He only had one enemy...
- Gennaro Savastano.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.360
If it wasn't for you, by now I'd be dead.

06:48.079 --> 06:51.079
There's no one on earth
I can trust anymore.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.920
Only you.

06:56.079 --> 06:57.720
You're beautiful.

07:05.199 --> 07:08.879
I decided to take Pietro to school,
he needs normality.

07:10.279 --> 07:12.839
- If you like, I'll come too.
- There's no need.

07:21.839 --> 07:23.360
And Luciana?

07:25.360 --> 07:28.000
Mistral did what he had to.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.839
If I'd betrayed you,
would you have killed me?

08:37.960 --> 08:40.360
The Iceman told me you were here.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.039
And here I am.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.240
Angelo, I know I asked
something difficult of you,

08:52.320 --> 08:54.360
something hard.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.879
It was the only price
to pay for betrayal.

09:01.639 --> 09:03.960
I did what had to be done.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.279
Let's go, the others are waiting for us.

09:13.799 --> 09:16.399
Come in my car.
Or is that a problem?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.840
No problem, Genna'.

09:19.919 --> 09:21.159
Let's go.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.840
Hi, Lil Monk.

10:04.159 --> 10:05.919
Everyone's here.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.480
Good, wait for me there.

10:19.399 --> 10:22.360
Keep an eye on him,
don't let him outta your sight.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.120
With discretion, but keep me informed.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.360
Don't you trust him anymore?

10:34.919 --> 10:38.399
Trust is a weakness
I've never been able to afford.

10:44.279 --> 10:46.960
Blue Blood's dead.

10:47.039 --> 10:50.120
That's what happens to those
who trust Ciro Di Marzio,

10:50.200 --> 10:52.279
to those who try to betray me.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.080
To win this war
there's still one thing left to do.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.639
Ciro's men have four spots

10:59.720 --> 11:03.399
where they sell the drugs
they stole from us at bargain prices

11:03.480 --> 11:05.320
because they didn't pay for it.

11:05.399 --> 11:09.559
We gotta sell drugs
at a lower price than theirs.

11:10.799 --> 11:15.799
All Naples needs to know who has
the best drugs at the cheapest price.

11:15.879 --> 11:17.879
Ciro's spots have gotta empty out.

11:17.960 --> 11:22.080
Less coke he sells,
the less money he has for his people.

11:23.519 --> 11:25.399
Yeah, but us too.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.919
If we lower the price we earn half.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.440
But we still gotta pay the same number
of people. What do we do?

11:33.919 --> 11:36.720
To win the war, it takes sacrifice,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.679
so let's arm ourselves with patience.

11:41.759 --> 11:46.360
Once we've won, we'll sell
at the old price with no competition.

11:52.559 --> 11:56.000
That's all.
Mistral, will you take care of it?

11:56.080 --> 11:57.600
Let's get to work.

12:39.799 --> 12:42.039
- All good?
- All good.

12:43.559 --> 12:45.279
That's from Forcella.

12:46.279 --> 12:47.600
Evening.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.600
Evening, guys.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
- Don't lose count.
- Don't worry, Old-Timer.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.600
Evening.

13:04.759 --> 13:06.240
See ya, bro.

13:08.159 --> 13:09.639
Night, guys.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.399
Ciro.

13:15.279 --> 13:17.240
Keep your eyes peeled.

13:21.279 --> 13:23.480
It's late, I thought you'd be asleep.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.600
- I wasn't tired.
- We all need rest.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.159
Even you.

13:30.639 --> 13:32.320
Got a cigarette?

13:49.279 --> 13:50.759
What's up, Pure'n'Simple?

13:53.840 --> 13:55.600
When we first met you,

13:55.679 --> 13:58.759
we were only kids who dreamed
of devouring the world.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.480
And now I'm the only one left.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.320
He died like that because
Gennaro wanted to hurt me.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.159
We gotta keep going for Enzo.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.320
Or else he died for nothing.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.759
This dream isn't over.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.639
We're still here.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.879
And I swear to you...

14:30.919 --> 14:33.720
Gennaro will pay for this too.

16:26.559 --> 16:28.799
I'm out of cigarettes.

16:29.679 --> 16:30.919
You're smoking a lot.

16:40.039 --> 16:42.159
Does Gennaro suspect anything?

16:48.879 --> 16:51.360
If he finds out, he'll kill us both.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.440
There's no need for you to tell me.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.320
It's better if you kill me now.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.519
Sweetheart, we have to go.

17:30.039 --> 17:31.319
Come on, it's late.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.759
Be a good boy.

17:43.599 --> 17:46.119
Are you taking me to school too?

17:50.839 --> 17:52.400
Really?

17:53.599 --> 17:56.559
Of course Papa
will take you to school too.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.480
Come on.

18:21.240 --> 18:24.319
So, do you like this school more
or the old one?

18:24.400 --> 18:25.759
This one.

18:26.519 --> 18:28.599
Off you go, it's late.

18:29.039 --> 18:30.039
Let's go.

18:37.759 --> 18:39.200
Be good now.

19:15.480 --> 19:19.680
We're doing good,
we just need to improve security.

19:19.759 --> 19:23.240
The Immortal's spots
will definitely be deserted.

19:23.319 --> 19:25.640
This is the last sacrifice for all of us.

19:28.799 --> 19:32.559
Your wife would have been happy
to see your spots working.

19:34.519 --> 19:36.880
If she can't see it,
that's entirely her fault.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.640
If you'll excuse me...

20:13.880 --> 20:17.960
What happens next?
Should I call his parents?

20:18.039 --> 20:21.720
The boy comes with us
and we'll wait for the judge's decision.

20:21.799 --> 20:25.079
Pietrino, now we'll take you
to another house

20:25.160 --> 20:28.519
where there are lots of other kids,
you'll really like it.

20:28.599 --> 20:30.680
Yes, but when is Mamma coming?

20:56.720 --> 20:59.759
- There's hardly anyone.
- It's the same in Forcella.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.000
Gennaro's selling cocaine at half price.

21:04.079 --> 21:07.039
- He's desperate.
- It's the only thing he could do.

21:08.759 --> 21:11.839
Soon the spots will be
the last of his problems.

21:36.079 --> 21:39.160
The lawyer called me,
the hearing's tomorrow at ten.

21:40.079 --> 21:41.880
They'll take him away from us.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.440
This time they'll take him away.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.200
We don't know that.

21:51.279 --> 21:54.839
If the court thinks he's in danger,
they'll take him for sure.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.680
Did you find out who gave testimony?

22:05.519 --> 22:07.400
Carmelo,

22:07.480 --> 22:09.720
one of the Gentleman's men.

22:15.799 --> 22:18.480
I promise I'll fix everything.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.519
There's only one thing you gotta promise.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.519
That after you bring my son back to me,

22:30.839 --> 22:33.079
you'll kill Ciro Di Marzio
in front of me.

22:46.079 --> 22:50.359
The minor Pietro Savastano
will be placed in a suitable facility.

22:50.759 --> 22:55.119
We have determined there
are urgent and appropriate reasons

22:55.200 --> 22:58.400
for the minor to be placed
in a suitable environment,

22:58.480 --> 23:02.480
pending verification
of the parental capabilities

23:02.559 --> 23:05.119
of the minor's mother and father...

23:30.839 --> 23:33.440
- I'm so sorry.
- Where are they taking him?

23:33.519 --> 23:38.119
The location of the foster home
is secret, only the judge knows.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.920
- There's nothing we can do?
- Not now.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.440
We can discuss Pietro's removal again,

23:45.519 --> 23:48.440
but in a year from today.

23:48.519 --> 23:50.640
In a year?

23:50.720 --> 23:54.200
Unfortunately, I have
more bad news for you.

23:54.519 --> 23:57.839
I read the document
you received this morning.

23:57.920 --> 24:01.400
Tomorrow, you have to go see Ruggieri
as a person informed of the facts

24:01.480 --> 24:04.480
in the inquiry into Carmelo Lo Diacono.

24:04.559 --> 24:07.400
By law I cannot be present.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.480
That piece of shit's gotta die.

24:09.559 --> 24:13.400
Gennaro, you need to relax,
for now it's only an informal chat.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.839
They took Gennaro's kid.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.160
So it went the way you wanted.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.160
It went the way we wanted.

24:47.839 --> 24:51.319
- I want him dead.
- His kid's the first step.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.359
Try not to make me wait too long then.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.680
Mistral?

25:35.759 --> 25:37.240
Nothing,

25:37.319 --> 25:39.240
but I'm keeping my eyes open.

25:44.319 --> 25:48.640
You gotta do something
else important, on the down-low.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.559
At your disposal.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.319
I'll wait for you outside.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.119
I'm glad you came.

26:14.519 --> 26:16.240
Did I have a choice?

26:23.640 --> 26:26.880
I heard about Pietro, I'm sorry,
I'm a father too.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.440
But he'll be fine,
you don't need to worry.

26:29.519 --> 26:31.519
I don't believe you're sorry.

26:32.440 --> 26:37.119
The state must protect minors
living in dangerous environments.

26:37.200 --> 26:41.200
- An environment your husband created.
- That's your opinion.

26:41.279 --> 26:45.240
A child shouldn't be separated
from his mother and father.

26:45.319 --> 26:47.519
That doesn't depend on me,

26:48.400 --> 26:51.400
but we can find a way
for you to get him back.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.599
The way you're suggesting
doesn't interest me.

26:59.599 --> 27:02.000
So you don't intend to collaborate?

27:08.200 --> 27:12.119
When all the pain comes,
remember clearly

27:13.440 --> 27:16.279
that you could have chosen
to get your son back

27:16.359 --> 27:19.119
and because of your husband
you didn't do it.

27:24.160 --> 27:27.519
You know what people like me
and my husband say?

27:33.920 --> 27:36.119
You don't touch children.

27:36.640 --> 27:37.559
Ever.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.759
Explain to me, Federico.

27:49.599 --> 27:52.119
Gennaro orders us
to do something like this

27:52.200 --> 27:54.119
and we have to do it with Mistral?

27:55.880 --> 27:58.000
How can we trust Mistral?

27:58.079 --> 28:00.640
Are you forgetting his wife sold us out?

28:01.640 --> 28:05.880
We just gotta watch him
and stay on him.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.000
And you're cool with that?

28:09.960 --> 28:12.119
If they catch us it's 30 years.

28:12.200 --> 28:15.359
I'd never do something so sensitive
with Mistral.

28:17.119 --> 28:20.119
Gennaro shouldn't have put us
in this shit position.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.720
- They took his kid.
- Great.

28:22.799 --> 28:25.079
If I was him, I'd do it myself.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.279
But you stay in your place
and he'll stay in his.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.440
And whatever he tells you to do,
you do it.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.319
Can I come in?

29:03.559 --> 29:06.480
Gennaro needs
something very important.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.119
What Gennaro says is gospel to me.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.440
I'm sorry.

29:46.839 --> 29:49.759
It must have been
the greatest suffering in your life.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.839
I've been there too.

30:01.559 --> 30:03.640
There's a difference
between me and you.

30:05.759 --> 30:08.480
You're a bloodless snake

30:10.119 --> 30:13.839
who killed his girlfriend
to earn a position in the clan.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.319
I did what I did to the love of my life

30:19.400 --> 30:21.680
because I'm a man of honor.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.640
Now fuck off outta my house

30:26.720 --> 30:29.839
and call me only when
you need me for a job.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.440
See you, Mistral.

31:20.359 --> 31:22.519
Ruggieri asked me to testify.

31:23.759 --> 31:26.359
He said it's the only way
to get Pietro back.

31:28.839 --> 31:29.960
I said no.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.759
I got an idea.

31:45.319 --> 31:46.759
But it's very dangerous.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.000
What is it?

33:20.519 --> 33:24.079
Gennaro asked me to do something
with Lil Monk, it's tricky.

33:27.279 --> 33:29.240
But it could be good for us.

33:31.960 --> 33:35.079
If I help him find the boy,
Gennaro will be grateful.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.839
Gennaro will never forgive me.

33:49.519 --> 33:51.920
And if he catches you, he'll kill you,

33:52.680 --> 33:56.279
- Why are you still with him?
- Because I'm a man of honor.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.799
Angelo...

34:08.480 --> 34:10.280
that was before...

34:11.440 --> 34:13.519
before he asked you to kill me.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.840
But Pietro's his son, not yours.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.760
Why should you run the risk?

34:43.199 --> 34:46.159
Gennaro was right not to trust him,
we gotta tell him.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.760
Don't you want to tell him?

34:54.679 --> 34:57.639
We gotta do the right thing
at the right time.

34:57.719 --> 34:59.000
Let's go.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.679
Tonight we gotta assemble
all our people.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.480
Gennaro's head's not in the game,
all he can think of is his son.

35:14.559 --> 35:17.400
- Now we can hurt him.
- What you gonna do?

35:18.440 --> 35:21.199
I want to unleash hell, a civil war.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.920
I want blood and death.

35:24.760 --> 35:28.519
If the cops are at his spots,
he won't sell anything.

35:29.679 --> 35:31.639
Tonight we avenge Enzo.

35:50.519 --> 35:52.920
All right, Mr. Ruggieri, I'll tell him.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.400
He'll be really pleased.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.679
Goodbye.

35:58.360 --> 36:02.639
Papa said he'll come later
and we'll get ice cream.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.360
Where is he?

37:00.440 --> 37:02.280
Where's my son?

37:02.360 --> 37:04.440
Nasty thing, fear.

37:06.599 --> 37:09.400
If you can't manage it,
it gets dangerous,

37:09.480 --> 37:11.400
you lose your mental clarity.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.599
It takes practice to manage fear.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.840
What do you want?

37:33.159 --> 37:36.280
Tell me where Pietro is
and I'll tell you where your son is.

37:37.840 --> 37:41.119
I need to make some calls,
ask favors, I need time.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.360
I'll decide how much time you get.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.800
- Has he eaten?
- He didn't want anything.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.239
The kid decides?

40:03.079 --> 40:05.400
Am I meant to stick food in his mouth?

40:10.239 --> 40:12.360
Simone, are you okay? You didn't eat.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.159
Come on, Papa will be here soon.

40:16.239 --> 40:18.599
Be a good boy, eat up.

40:30.079 --> 40:34.440
He's a magistrate's son,
what we're doing is so fucking stupid!

40:35.639 --> 40:37.119
It'll be over soon.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.199
It'll be over soon...

41:03.000 --> 41:06.119
Tonight we'll descend
on their turf like demons.

41:06.199 --> 41:08.840
We gotta kill, we gotta destroy.

41:08.920 --> 41:10.880
We gotta bring the cops in.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.639
People going to buy their gear
will have to flee.

41:13.719 --> 41:16.559
None of them must be left standing.

41:16.639 --> 41:18.639
The Savastanos' day is over.

41:19.519 --> 41:20.559
Let's roll!

42:08.239 --> 42:09.960
How did it go?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.760
How it was supposed to.

42:15.480 --> 42:18.159
We gotta put a couple of lookouts
on the buildings.

42:18.719 --> 42:20.679
I'll send some guys tomorrow.

42:22.559 --> 42:24.079
Go, bro.

42:24.519 --> 42:25.639
Go, go!

42:26.079 --> 42:27.400
Hurry!

42:28.280 --> 42:30.159
Wake up!

42:30.239 --> 42:31.719
Let's move it along.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.559
Come on, people!

42:34.639 --> 42:37.760
One at a time, get your money out.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.760
Get your money out.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.679
Get everything.

43:09.679 --> 43:11.079
Quick!

43:12.199 --> 43:13.559
- You ready?
- Yeah.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.280
Son of a bitch!

44:32.960 --> 44:34.480
Let's go!

45:01.119 --> 45:03.440
The Savastanos' day is over.

45:05.239 --> 45:07.119
We have the Immortal.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.320
But you're not immortal.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.079
What happened?

46:04.159 --> 46:07.320
Ciro Di Marzio and his men
came and opened fire on our turf.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.800
How are you?

46:12.559 --> 46:14.719
I killed one of them, Luciana.

46:19.159 --> 46:21.400
But he wasn't afraid.

46:21.920 --> 46:23.840
He was happy.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.880
Happy to die?

46:25.960 --> 46:27.960
Happy to die for the Immortal.

46:28.039 --> 46:29.960
These people aren't like us,

46:30.039 --> 46:33.320
they're like martyrs sacrificing
themselves in the name of Jesus.

46:33.400 --> 46:36.360
This isn't a war for them,
it's a crusade.

46:36.440 --> 46:38.440
And if that's true,

46:40.119 --> 46:42.440
then the Immortal has already won.

46:45.239 --> 46:47.320
That's why I betrayed Gennaro.

46:48.960 --> 46:53.239
There's nothing worse than fighting
a war on the wrong side.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.840
