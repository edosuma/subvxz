WEBVTT

00:00.601 --> 00:03.869
[Iron Man]
Ultron! I knew he was
out there somewhere.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.105
[Hawkeye]
And he just absorbed
the Super-Adaptoid

00:06.107 --> 00:08.173
and AIM's Scientist Supreme.

00:08.175 --> 00:11.443
Then he's gonna get
a super supreme smashing.
[roars]

00:13.013 --> 00:14.013
[groans]

00:14.015 --> 00:15.447
[grunting]

00:18.218 --> 00:21.153
I have no interest in fighting.

00:21.155 --> 00:24.423
Ultron, I don't care
what you're interested in.

00:26.626 --> 00:30.229
I have bigger plans,
bigger goals.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.432
I let you get away before.
It won't happen again.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.505
[both grunt]

00:39.507 --> 00:43.242
Hey, Iron Man,
Ultron's the target, not us.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.077
Give him everything
you've got.

00:45.079 --> 00:48.347
We need to take him down
before he stabilizes
this new body.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.315
[grunts, yells]

00:53.253 --> 00:55.721
[grunts, groans]

00:55.723 --> 00:57.556
It's not working.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.625
You're not walking away
from this one.

01:04.364 --> 01:07.533
If you desire today
to be your last,

01:07.535 --> 01:09.234
so be it.

01:10.603 --> 01:14.273
You humans think
you can control technology,

01:14.275 --> 01:18.310
but it's the technology
that controls you.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.549
Whoa! Everything's locked up!

01:23.551 --> 01:26.718
Aaahh!

01:26.720 --> 01:28.587
[both grunt]

01:29.556 --> 01:31.223
[grunting]

01:31.225 --> 01:33.358
All our tech's
outta control!

01:33.360 --> 01:35.594
[yelling]

01:38.932 --> 01:42.301
Good-bye, Avengers.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.383
[grunts]

02:00.753 --> 02:05.457
Your trickery, Ultron,
is no match
for the Prince of Asgard!

02:05.459 --> 02:09.461
Ultron has control of our tech,
but I'm working
to jam his signal. Whoa!

02:10.597 --> 02:13.499
Hulk! Thor!
Iron Man needs some time!

02:17.670 --> 02:20.405
Everybody needs time.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.407
Hulk just needs a target.
[growls]

02:23.643 --> 02:25.277
[groans]

02:25.279 --> 02:26.612
[grunting]

02:26.614 --> 02:28.747
Okay, Ultron. Let's jam.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.415
[Falcon]
I hope you know
what you're doing.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.589
Ah, technology.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.525
Nothing tech can't do.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.327
Yeah, well, some of us rely
on our natural skills.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.336
Okay, and a little bit
of tech.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.439
Hawkeye,
what did you do?
Just an EMP arrow.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.375
What's the big deal?
It stopped Ultron.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.010
Yeah, and everyone else too.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.512
Why didn't you warn us
you were using one of those?

03:00.514 --> 03:03.348
[Hawkeye]
Well, excuse me
for being creative!

03:03.350 --> 03:04.583
System back online.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.986
[grunts]

03:07.988 --> 03:12.624
It's been fun.
But, now, if you'll excuse me.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.527
We're getting nowhere.
We need an organized attack.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.563
[Iron Man]
Not me.
I'm finishing Ultron today.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.666
I just need Hulk.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.402
<i>You sure you know</i>
<i>what you're doing?</i>

03:23.404 --> 03:25.771
Friday, you there?
<i>Where else would I be?</i>

03:26.973 --> 03:29.541
Friday, set my armor
to overload.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.743
<i>Done. Hope you know</i>
<i>what you're doing.</i>

03:31.745 --> 03:34.546
Why does everybody
keep saying that? Hulk!

03:34.548 --> 03:37.583
Attack plan:
New York Minute.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.055
[grunts]

03:54.567 --> 03:57.769
[groans, grunts]
I'm... okay.

03:57.771 --> 04:01.473
From where I'm standing,
it looks like Ultron's
been vaporized to dust.

04:03.876 --> 04:06.678
I wish I could believe that.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.416
[grunting]

04:18.591 --> 04:20.826
[grunting continues]

04:22.428 --> 04:23.595
[groans]

04:23.597 --> 04:25.697
We are all tired, Hawkeye,

04:25.699 --> 04:27.699
but you must do the sim.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.035
It's a waste of time.

04:30.037 --> 04:33.538
I can take down these bots
with just one shot.

04:38.878 --> 04:41.647
Tony's been searching
for Ultron for a week,

04:41.649 --> 04:45.484
and while he's finding nothing,
he's got us cooped up in here
doing nothing.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.819
I'm with Hawkeye.
All of us have responsibilities

04:47.821 --> 04:50.756
apart from the Avengers,
and we're neglecting them.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.458
For what?
To stand around and...

04:57.597 --> 04:59.598
[Captain America
clears throat]

04:59.600 --> 05:04.102
Realize you're busy,
but have you found
any sign of Ultron?

05:04.104 --> 05:07.606
Not yet, but I'm close.
There any way we can help?

05:07.608 --> 05:09.841
'Cause other than drills,
we're not doing anything.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.611
I mean, you can't expect us
to just wait.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.813
That's exactly what
I expect you to do.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.015
Never assume Ultron
is gone for good.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.917
We've learned
that lesson before.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.855
You're not above
the team, Stark.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.857
The rest of us
have work to do, too,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.859
but you don't care,
you pompous jerk,

05:27.861 --> 05:30.462
because you only think
of your--

05:30.464 --> 05:32.631
We are not fighting
each other.

05:32.633 --> 05:36.868
Whatever you were going to say,
Tony will see as a compliment.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.603
Look, we're going
a little stir-crazy.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.939
Maybe it's time for the team
to go out and get some air.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.708
You've obviously got
the search under control.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.677
As soon as you find Ultron,
send the signal.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.846
We will gladly return
with all haste.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.517
Fine. I can't stop you
from going.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.653
But you'll be back
sooner than you think.

05:54.655 --> 05:58.890
I'll find him,
and I'll find him myself.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.859
That happened.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.729
Well, bad guys
don't smash themselves.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.731
Friend Hulk is right.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.933
We all have work to do.

06:12.905 --> 06:14.906
[Black Widow]
Sneaking in the back door.
Huh?

06:14.908 --> 06:17.809
Always a bad sign.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.512
[grunting]
Yah!

06:20.514 --> 06:22.647
Check another off my list.

06:22.649 --> 06:26.752
That leaves me just
another 8,000 to go.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.526
<i>[Friday]</i>
<i>I've gone ahead</i>
<i>and loaded your tablet</i>

06:34.528 --> 06:36.828
<i>with study materials</i>
<i>for advanced</i>
<i>building techniques</i>

06:36.830 --> 06:39.498
<i>and structural support</i>
<i>in skyscrapers.</i>

06:39.500 --> 06:42.200
Thanks, Friday.
Don't know how you can
help Tony look for Ultron

06:42.202 --> 06:43.902
and help me at the same time.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.837
<i>Multitasking</i>
<i>is in my programming.</i>

06:45.839 --> 06:49.541
<i>How are you able</i>
<i>to be an Avenger</i>
<i>and still take college courses?</i>

06:49.543 --> 06:51.543
Hard work is in my programming.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.745
<i>Is that why you're here</i>
<i>on a Saturday?</i>

06:53.747 --> 06:55.113
I've always had to prove
I'm good enough.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.048
<i>But what about...</i>
<i>[static]</i>

06:57.050 --> 06:59.951
Friday?

07:08.561 --> 07:10.562
Ah, good old Brooklyn.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.964
You haven't changed a bit.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.567
[gasps]
It's Captain America!

07:15.569 --> 07:17.769
[clicks]

07:17.771 --> 07:20.605
Don't forget to tag me.
[chuckles]

07:22.975 --> 07:27.179
Brubaker's Bakery?
They still around the corner?

07:41.093 --> 07:42.961
Stop right there.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.298
Step out where I can see you.

07:51.571 --> 07:55.140
Captain America,
you are obsolete.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.210
You are to be replaced.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.983
[grunts]

08:07.787 --> 08:11.089
[grunting]

08:11.091 --> 08:15.026
You're not fooling
anyone, Ultron.
[grunting]

08:16.162 --> 08:18.196
You are obsolete.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.332
You are to be replaced.

08:24.770 --> 08:28.206
Friday, boost power.
Ultron's out there somewhere.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.208
I can feel it.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.878
Friday? Are you there?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.212
[mechanical whirring]

08:34.214 --> 08:36.248
Huh?

08:47.660 --> 08:50.195
Assembling parts
of different suits.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.097
That's just brilliant.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.068
Like something I would
expect from you, Ultron.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.205
Aaahhh!

09:01.140 --> 09:03.141
You're my mistake,

09:03.143 --> 09:05.243
and this time
I'm gonna fix it!

09:10.249 --> 09:14.185
Iron Man,
you are obsolete.

09:14.187 --> 09:17.222
[grunts]
I've been waiting
for my chance at a rematch!

09:23.729 --> 09:25.163
But we're gonna fight
on my terms.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.244
You are obsolete.
[grunts]

09:39.246 --> 09:41.913
You are to be replaced.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.950
This was not on
my to-do list today.

[horn blaring]

10:10.277 --> 10:12.077
[clamoring]

10:12.079 --> 10:14.980
Too many bystanders.
Have to get back to the Tower.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.848
[grunts]

10:21.787 --> 10:24.189
[grunts]

10:29.295 --> 10:31.429
You are obsolete.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.264
You are to be replaced.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.167
Tony, Ultron's back.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.270
Tony?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.339
Can't get a comm signal through
to Avengers Tower.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.009
Guessing you have
something to do with that.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.314
Hey, Ultron, over here!

10:49.316 --> 10:53.151
You can pick on someone
exactly your size.
[grunts]

10:56.288 --> 10:58.189
[tires screeching]

11:08.300 --> 11:10.035
[grunts]

11:10.037 --> 11:12.504
Humanity has such potential,

11:12.506 --> 11:14.873
once I set them
on the path of unity.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.375
Avengers, I found Ultron.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.512
Erase their inefficient
individuality.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.681
Cap? Widow?

11:22.683 --> 11:26.785
Anyone?
Douse their
unpredictable fire.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.187
Since you've merged
with the Scientist Supreme,

11:29.189 --> 11:31.756
you've become
annoyingly chatty.

11:33.325 --> 11:34.893
And now I'm gonna
shut you up for good.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.632
I made a few upgrades
to the Tower.

11:40.634 --> 11:43.435
Like that force field.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.538
Still a work in progress.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.874
[grunts]

11:49.876 --> 11:53.011
I'm gonna replace
every human on Earth.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.613
Too bad you won't
be alive to see it.

11:57.750 --> 12:01.653
Hey, Tony!
You mind if I make
a huge mess in here?

12:01.655 --> 12:04.289
You've never asked
permission before.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.996
Thanks for the help.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.599
Oh, I didn't come to help.
I came to get help.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.174
[Iron Man]
Have you two met?

12:30.382 --> 12:33.118
Of course someone
would want to duplicate me.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.754
But it looks like Ultron's
done it to everybody.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.756
Door won't hold for long.
Now what?

12:37.758 --> 12:40.625
Can't call the team.
Friday and all of her
comms are down.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.627
The others don't need
to be told what to do.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.562
Have some faith.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.731
You're never gonna believe...

12:46.733 --> 12:48.466
[grunts]

12:48.468 --> 12:50.368
'Tis madness!

12:50.370 --> 12:53.037
It's right on my tail.
Other Hulk coming to smash.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.979
[Iron Man]
I always wondered
if I could take you guys.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.314
As long as we don't
get in each other's way
this time.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.717
Why do I get the feeling
that was directed at me?

13:05.719 --> 13:07.619
And that was too!

13:11.056 --> 13:14.626
[grunting]

13:28.607 --> 13:30.575
You are obsolete.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.777
And you're gonna
eat street!

13:32.779 --> 13:34.846

13:34.848 --> 13:35.847
Whoa!

14:21.194 --> 14:23.895
Let's get 'em down
from there.
Look out!

14:25.698 --> 14:27.699
Get the civilians to safety.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.334
As long as you're
providing cover.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.102
Good thing I happen
to have a shield.

Did anybody lose
a giant A?

14:52.659 --> 14:55.226
I just had this polished.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.928
I've got this.

Wrecking New York
makes Hulk mad!

15:07.673 --> 15:09.707
[people gasp]

15:09.709 --> 15:12.810
Climb down to safety.
You guys don't give up,
do you?

15:14.947 --> 15:17.382
Then, if you're
duplicates of us,
I guess you wouldn't.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.585
Not duplicates, Ultimates.

15:35.467 --> 15:36.768
Aah!

15:43.609 --> 15:44.976
[grunting]

15:48.047 --> 15:51.783
Our time apart working
on our individual skills
made us stronger.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.551
But these Ultimates
are perfect.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.054
How do we compete
against perfect versions
of ourselves?

15:58.557 --> 16:02.293
We're imperfect,
but we're human,
and that wins every time.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.996
<i>[chuckles]</i>
<i>Never thought I'd hear you</i>
<i>admit to an imperfection.</i>

16:04.998 --> 16:07.065
Just trying to fit in
with the rest of you.

16:07.067 --> 16:11.069
But we're all unpredictable,
illogical.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.237
Perfect shot
from a safe distance.

16:14.773 --> 16:17.842
But that's exactly
what you were expecting, right?

16:22.247 --> 16:23.548
[beeping]

16:31.423 --> 16:33.992
Yah! Yah!

16:36.295 --> 16:37.829
Here. Catch.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.666
[grunts]

16:41.668 --> 16:44.102
Sometimes you gotta
think outside the shield.

16:45.371 --> 16:49.107
Come at me. Go ahead.
Hulk not smash.

17:18.837 --> 17:21.105
Eat my jet stream, Ultron!

17:23.075 --> 17:25.476
Hulk, smash the center column.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.645
Won't that bring down
the whole building?

17:27.646 --> 17:30.248
I've been studying engineering.
Trust me.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.649
I know my stuff.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.251
You got it, Professor!

17:45.664 --> 17:47.331
[grunts]

17:49.701 --> 17:53.204
Yeah. Never turn your back
on an Avenger.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.273
Or anyone from Brooklyn.
[thunderclap]

18:00.913 --> 18:04.282
Your hammer's lightening
is only an imitation.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.286
Mine is the real thing!

18:16.862 --> 18:17.895
[thud]

18:17.897 --> 18:19.931
[yells]

18:31.310 --> 18:32.977
Ultimates, unite.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.624
[Black Widow]
You still have those EMP arrows?

18:46.626 --> 18:49.827
Oh, the ones that everyone
got mad at me
for using last time?

18:49.829 --> 18:52.430
Quit your whining.
This time we're ready.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.598
Thor, strike!

18:53.600 --> 18:55.967
With pleasure!

19:05.277 --> 19:08.346
Huh. We should work
together more often.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.780
Aye.
[yelling]

19:09.782 --> 19:10.982
[thud]
[groans]

19:10.984 --> 19:13.351
Well, maybe not that often.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.520
Six down, one more to...

19:15.522 --> 19:17.688
Wait.
Where's the other me?

19:17.690 --> 19:20.858
Uh, maybe he got scared
and ran away?

19:20.860 --> 19:22.693
Not very likely.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.061
There.

19:27.799 --> 19:31.369
I could lead humanity
into a bright new future,

19:31.371 --> 19:34.472
or I could drag them
kicking and screaming.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.707
Kicking and screaming it is.

19:36.709 --> 19:40.645
We could be one big,
happy Ultron family.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.547
[clamoring]

19:47.786 --> 19:51.455
[Hawkeye]
I'm guessing that's not
a feel-good, happy scan thingy.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.791
[Iron Man]
He's scanning everyone
to replace them.

19:53.793 --> 19:57.628
What he tried to do to us,
he's gonna do
to the whole world.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.398
Yeah, I don't really feel
like fighting seven billion
of those things.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.402
If we can't go through it,
we'll go under it.
[yells]

20:12.411 --> 20:15.346
All of humanity
will be upgraded.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.548
[thudding]

20:20.018 --> 20:21.652
[Hulk roars]

20:29.494 --> 20:30.995
[Iron Man]
Give up the fight, Ultron.

20:30.997 --> 20:35.032
If you could see what I see,
you wouldn't fight me.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.568
You would join me.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.938
No, thanks!

20:41.873 --> 20:44.609
You may win small victories,

20:44.611 --> 20:47.678
but in the end,
you will always fail,

20:47.680 --> 20:50.848
because you are... imperfect.

20:50.850 --> 20:56.354
Your team of perfect parts
can't beat our team
of imperfect parts.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.456
Your perfection
doomed you, Ultron.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.726
We learn from our mistakes
and from each other.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.728
Well, most of us.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.730
Okay. Me too.

21:05.732 --> 21:09.400
I will upgrade all--

21:09.402 --> 21:11.602
I think we've made our point.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.571
Nice to change things up.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.941
Fighting threats instead of,
you know, ourselves.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.644
Even when those threats
look just like us.

21:19.646 --> 21:23.748
Taking down Ultron today
proved something I already knew.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.951
I'll always be proud
to call you my friends,

21:26.953 --> 21:28.986
my team--

21:28.988 --> 21:31.622
the Avengers.
