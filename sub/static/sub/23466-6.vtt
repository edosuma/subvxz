WEBVTT

00:11.167 --> 00:16.467
-[gunfire in distance]
-[drums playing]

00:36.600 --> 00:38.633
[baby crying]

00:42.867 --> 00:45.067
[girl screaming]

01:34.767 --> 01:37.567
-[Gary] Still nothing?
-They're still not answering.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.900
-[Gary] But you've been...
-Yeah, calling every 30 minutes,

01:40.067 --> 01:41.767
just like you asked.

01:41.900 --> 01:46.533
They haven't answered in days.
How long we gonna keep trying?

01:47.933 --> 01:49.833
Let me make sure
I'm getting this right.

01:49.967 --> 01:53.067
David Koresh
believes the opening
of the fifth seal begins

01:53.167 --> 01:55.700
-when Babylon, the ATF...
-Mm-hm.

01:55.833 --> 01:59.633
-...attacks
the "peculiar people."
-Right, the Branch Davidians.

01:59.767 --> 02:03.067
Then there's a quote.
"Little season of waiting."

02:03.167 --> 02:05.833
Yes, that's what they believe
they're in right now.

02:05.967 --> 02:09.367
And that little season
culminates in a second round
of bloodshed

02:09.500 --> 02:12.167
-in which
the rest of them are killed.
-Exactly.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.833
[James] But where this
gets interesting

02:13.967 --> 02:16.333
is the interpretation
of the little season.

02:16.467 --> 02:20.733
Um, in Biblical terms,
that could be a month
or a decade.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.200
It's not specific.

02:23.333 --> 02:28.300
And the word "season"
in the Bible is a translation
of the Greek word "kairos,"

02:28.433 --> 02:30.133
-which actually means...
-Time.

02:30.267 --> 02:32.267
..."time" more than "season."

02:32.400 --> 02:38.100
So, you can think of it
like "right time" versus
a literal season.

02:38.233 --> 02:43.300
These people are not crazy.
David Koresh is not crazy.

02:43.433 --> 02:45.967
His theology follows
a coherent logic.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.833
Agree with it or not,
there's something to it.

02:48.967 --> 02:51.300
[Ron] If you say so,
I believe you. Uh...

02:51.433 --> 02:53.933
Let's open up this conversation
to some callers.

02:54.067 --> 02:55.800
Uh, Derek, you're on the air.

02:55.933 --> 02:58.767
Hey, Ron. Say, I'm, uh--
I'm one of the camera guys

02:58.900 --> 03:00.900
that's standing out here
watching Mount Carmel.

03:01.067 --> 03:03.533
Something occurred to me.
You know how the Branch
Davidians

03:03.667 --> 03:05.833
have no way of communicating
with the outside world?

03:06.600 --> 03:10.067
I've been thinking.
There's this huge satellite
dish on their roof.

03:10.133 --> 03:14.600
I mean, if we can somehow
get them to listen to your show,

03:14.733 --> 03:16.500
we can ask 'em
"yes or no" questions

03:16.633 --> 03:19.233
and they could move the dish
to answer, right?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.833
-Thibs.
-[Steve] Go, go.

03:21.967 --> 03:22.933
Go.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.267
[Ron] That's not a bad idea.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.900
I guess the question
would then be,

03:39.067 --> 03:41.500
"How do we get them
to listen to my show?"

03:41.633 --> 03:42.533
Whoa.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.633
Ron, they just moved it.
They moved the dish.

03:48.767 --> 03:50.900
-[chuckles]
-[Ron] They did?

03:51.067 --> 03:52.633
Again!

03:52.767 --> 03:54.167
[Ron] Are you guys
listening to me in there?

03:54.300 --> 03:57.233
Again! Come on, Thibs!

03:59.900 --> 04:02.567
[Derek chuckles]
They moved it again.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.900
-[Ron] That's a "yes."
-We have communications!

04:05.067 --> 04:09.867
-[Ron] That's a "yes."
Um, hi, guys...
-We have communications.

04:10.767 --> 04:13.367
-[chuckles]
-[Ron] Is there anything
you need?

05:03.067 --> 05:08.333
My name is Dick DeGuerin.
David Koresh's lawyer.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.533
Jack Zimmerman.
Steve Schneider's lawyer.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.733
We'd like to speak
with our clients.

05:14.767 --> 05:20.367
-Ron Engelman, KGBS.
-[scoffs] You can't be serious.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.133
You expect me to, what,
just let you walk up there
and knock on the front door?

05:24.267 --> 05:26.467
[Dick] We filed a writ
of habeas corpus.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.700
That only applies
when someone's in custody.

05:28.833 --> 05:32.533
Well, if they're not in custody,
we'll arrange transportation
so they can leave.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.133
They haven't even asked
for a lawyer.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.167
Yes, they have.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.400
They're asking
for their lawyers in front
of the whole world. Now...

05:41.533 --> 05:46.400
what do you think's
gonna happen to you when
this whole case is dismissed...

05:46.533 --> 05:48.967
because you refused them
the right to counsel?

06:04.433 --> 06:06.767
David, they're coming.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.167
[knocking on door]

06:24.600 --> 06:28.700
ATF claim that
you shot at them first
through those front doors,

06:28.833 --> 06:30.133
but the metal bends inward.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.733
They claim their helicopters
didn't fire,

06:32.867 --> 06:37.567
but the holes in Jaydean's room
are clearly from above.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.267
We have recordings,

06:39.400 --> 06:43.833
the 911s, Wayne made
of you trying to surrender.

06:43.967 --> 06:47.067
Trust me on this, gentlemen,
any jury sees this at all,

06:47.200 --> 06:49.700
you got a hell of a case
for self-defense here.

06:50.667 --> 06:53.233
This is the U.S. government
we're up against,

06:53.367 --> 06:56.067
and you're sitting here
telling me we're gonna get
a fair shake?

06:56.133 --> 06:59.633
The government
doesn't sit on the jury.
People like y'all do.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.967
[Dick] Let me ask you this.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.400
If you were on that jury
and you saw that front door,

07:04.533 --> 07:06.467
what would your verdict be?

07:10.833 --> 07:14.567
What's the plan?
What's the strategy here?

07:14.700 --> 07:17.967
The plan is we go for
full acquittal.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.600
Full acquittal?

07:22.133 --> 07:23.167
[sighs]

07:30.967 --> 07:33.867
-[David] Thanks again.
-We'll be in touch.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.500
You realize
we're standing outside.

07:49.633 --> 07:50.900
I know.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.700
What do you think?

07:58.367 --> 08:02.767
The theologian
on the radio show,
the little season...

08:02.900 --> 08:06.333
the camera man calling in,
the satellite...

08:06.467 --> 08:07.967
the lawyers...

08:10.667 --> 08:12.900
All of this doesn't happen
by chance.

08:15.967 --> 08:16.867
Come on.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.767
-[phone ringing]
-[Walter] Gary!

08:23.900 --> 08:27.800
-[grunts]
-[ringing continues]

08:30.533 --> 08:32.567
[clears throat] Hello?

08:32.700 --> 08:35.067
-Hello? Hello?
-[David] Gary?

08:35.833 --> 08:39.367
Oh, David. I have to say
I've missed the sound
of your voice, brother.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.800
-What's going on?
-Something special happened
today, Gary.

08:43.933 --> 08:46.567
Something I can't see
as anything short of a miracle.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.233
What are you saying?

08:52.867 --> 08:55.233
I got my sign from God, Gary.

08:57.267 --> 08:58.300
We're coming out.

09:03.733 --> 09:07.967
But first,
I want to protect the message
that we have going on in here.

09:08.100 --> 09:13.267
So, when I go to jail,
I can spend all my time
answering the stupid questions.

09:13.400 --> 09:17.133
Like, "Why do you have
so many wives in there?"

09:17.267 --> 09:19.133
and "Why are you
torturing babies?"

09:19.267 --> 09:22.467
'Cause once I finish writing
those seven seals,

09:22.600 --> 09:24.900
I will personally walk out
that front door,

09:25.067 --> 09:29.133
and you can throw me
in the jailhouse and come on
down and feed me bananas

09:29.267 --> 09:30.733
for all you want.

09:30.867 --> 09:32.333
I'll come feed you
anything you like.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.633
How long will it take you
to write it?

09:34.767 --> 09:37.200
Oh, I'm thinking a week,
a week or so.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.300
Are you telling me

09:39.433 --> 09:42.733
that once you have reduced
your version of the seven seals
to written form,

09:42.867 --> 09:44.967
that you and all your people
are coming out of there?

09:45.100 --> 09:48.200
I have no reason
to draw this out
any longer, Gary.

09:48.333 --> 09:51.767
Please answer the question
definitively.

09:51.900 --> 09:54.833
Are you coming out
as soon as you're done?

09:54.967 --> 09:59.067
Gary, I'm going to fulfill
my commitment to God.

09:59.867 --> 10:03.367
Now, if you would allow me
to show you what has been
pre-written by the prophets,

10:03.500 --> 10:07.200
you'll have
a way better understanding
of what's going on in here.

10:07.333 --> 10:10.367
I am asking you
a very simple question, David.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.233
-I need--
-I'm gonna give you
a very simple answer.

10:13.367 --> 10:16.767
Yes, yes, yes!

10:16.900 --> 10:19.867
We have no intention
of dying in here, Gary.

10:21.133 --> 10:23.633
Okay, David.
Well, I'm gonna let you
get to work

10:23.767 --> 10:27.833
because, frankly,
I am eagerly awaiting
that manuscript.

10:28.767 --> 10:30.433
Well, I tell you what.

10:31.333 --> 10:34.367
It's gonna blow
your socks off, Gary.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.133
My concern is...

10:43.267 --> 10:45.100
-we gotta make sure
that their field...
-They're surrendering.

10:46.300 --> 10:49.800
We're gonna work out
the details of the surrender

10:50.900 --> 10:54.400
while David writes down
his interpretation
of the seven seals.

10:54.533 --> 10:57.300
-Then they'll come out.
-How long is that gonna take?

10:57.433 --> 10:59.900
-They're guessing a week.
-Tell them to take a few
extra days.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.867
Maybe knock out his memoirs
while he's at it.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.933
I just got off the phone
with the man, okay?

11:04.067 --> 11:06.800
He told me,
"I never intended
to die in here."

11:06.933 --> 11:09.500
Those are his words,
okay? But...

11:09.633 --> 11:11.767
Koresh's biggest fear
is being silenced

11:11.900 --> 11:14.067
before he can share his message
with the world.

11:14.167 --> 11:16.833
If we let him write it,
he will come out peacefully.

11:16.967 --> 11:21.300
It's just another stall tactic.
You're not taking this
seriously, are you?

11:22.367 --> 11:25.067
Mitch,
we've been here six weeks.
What's one more?

11:25.200 --> 11:27.267
-I know
how long we've been here.
-One more.

11:27.400 --> 11:31.300
All right, Gary,
start working out
the details of surrender,

11:31.433 --> 11:32.900
and let's see if it happens.

11:33.067 --> 11:37.200
I can buy you one week.

11:38.733 --> 11:41.267
Yeah, thanks. Yeah.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.400
[indistinct chatter]

11:47.533 --> 11:50.633
Excuse me. Everyone, listen up.

11:51.767 --> 11:53.133
I've got some news.

11:55.133 --> 11:58.200
David's received
a sign from God.

11:58.333 --> 12:01.800
We're working out
a plan to surrender.

12:02.767 --> 12:04.067
It's over.

12:06.633 --> 12:08.067
It's all over.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.933
Oh! Oh, God!

12:14.800 --> 12:16.333
It's gonna be okay.

12:19.433 --> 12:20.700
I'm ready.

12:24.833 --> 12:27.067
-Strange, indeed...
-[typing]

12:27.167 --> 12:33.233
...for the judgment of man,
for who knows within himself
that his judgment be true?

12:33.367 --> 12:36.733
[Dick] Steve Schneider
will then deliver the manuscript
of the seven seals

12:36.867 --> 12:39.700
to the theologian James Tabor.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.633
Once the manuscript
is delivered to Tabor,

12:42.767 --> 12:44.900
David Koresh
will leave the building,

12:45.067 --> 12:50.400
either by foot or on stretcher,
followed by those remaining
on the inside.

12:50.533 --> 12:52.600
How do we know
the place isn't rigged
with bombs?

12:52.733 --> 12:55.333
I don't want my men
getting blown up
when they search the place.

12:55.467 --> 12:58.800
Mitch, why the hell would they
put bombs in their own house?

13:01.133 --> 13:03.267
I'll be the last one
out of the building, and...

13:03.400 --> 13:07.067
the Texas Rangers
will be the ones
to secure the scene,

13:07.167 --> 13:09.833
not you,
to protect the evidence.

13:09.967 --> 13:13.200
-Not acceptable.
-Non-negotiable.

13:14.167 --> 13:17.567
If you wanted them to trust you,
you shouldn't have tortured 'em.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.867
We'll accept those conditions.

13:21.833 --> 13:22.933
Good.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.933
[Michelle] Hey.

13:39.900 --> 13:43.800
-Hungry?
-[chuckles] Starving...

13:43.933 --> 13:47.167
for anything
but those disgusting things.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.533
First thing I'm gonna eat
when I get out of here...

13:50.667 --> 13:51.967
a whole box of fish sticks.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.067
-[laughs]
-Yeah.

14:00.367 --> 14:05.800
Do you think
you'll go to jail...
once this is done?

14:05.933 --> 14:09.467
Yeah.
Probably for a little while.

14:16.667 --> 14:19.067
Do you think I'll go to jail?

14:20.667 --> 14:21.867
No.

14:23.067 --> 14:24.933
No, that would be crazy.

14:25.067 --> 14:27.100
My idea of crazy
has been changing.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.867
-[both laugh]
-Yeah.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.633
But, hey...
when I get out of jail...

14:35.767 --> 14:37.767
I think I could look you up.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.100
Give you a call.

14:47.633 --> 14:49.067
You won't have to.

14:50.567 --> 14:54.867
I'll be
standing outside the jail,
waiting to drive you home.

15:01.900 --> 15:05.967
And I saw, in his right hand
that sat on the throne,

15:06.100 --> 15:10.933
a book written
within and on the backside,
sealed with seven seals...

15:11.067 --> 15:16.100
David, I gotta stop.
My finger's really
hurting here. [groans]

15:20.367 --> 15:25.800
And I saw a strong angel...
proclaim with a loud voice,

15:25.933 --> 15:28.533
"Who is worthy to open the book?

15:31.567 --> 15:33.533
And to loose its seals?"

15:36.433 --> 15:39.433
-[typing]
-[David] And no man in heaven...

15:39.567 --> 15:42.167
nor on earth,
nor under the earth...

15:45.533 --> 15:46.833
Honestly...

15:48.333 --> 15:52.700
how real do you think
this Koresh manuscript is?

15:52.833 --> 15:54.867
I-I think it's real.

15:55.067 --> 15:59.900
-Have you seen any of it yet?
-No, they haven't sent
anything out.

16:01.133 --> 16:03.067
Has anyone in there seen in it?

16:04.267 --> 16:08.167
Nobody's seen it,
but he's working on it
day and night, apparently.

16:18.533 --> 16:21.100
Like, have I read
the manuscript personally? No.

16:21.233 --> 16:23.800
-But...
I know he's working on it.
-[David] Strange, indeed...

16:23.933 --> 16:26.400
[Gary] All right, Steve,
I need you to send me some pages

16:26.533 --> 16:29.500
to show my bosses
that you and I are
working towards a resolution.

16:29.633 --> 16:33.067
Because right now,
they think David is stalling.

16:33.167 --> 16:39.267
-[Steve sighs] I can try, but--
-To avoid them making
any hasty decisions.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.233
Do you understand me?

16:42.367 --> 16:44.167
-[David]
...who knows within himself...
-[Judy typing]

16:44.300 --> 16:47.733
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

16:48.567 --> 16:51.133
We'll send out some pages.
I'll talk to David.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.633
Hey, where'd Prince go?

16:58.767 --> 17:00.333
He left with Decker.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.100
Wh-Where?

17:03.233 --> 17:05.100
I think they headed
to the airport.

17:09.600 --> 17:12.800
...saying with a loud voice,
"Worthy is the Lamb

17:12.933 --> 17:18.867
that was slain to receive honor
and power and glory--"

17:19.067 --> 17:20.500
-David--
-"...and strength.

17:20.633 --> 17:23.400
-Wisdom--"
-I need to talk to you.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.067
I need your permission
to send out some of
the manuscript pages.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.267
-No, it's not ready.
-[scoffs]

17:29.400 --> 17:32.767
David, Gary has got to
show his bosses that we are
really doing something here.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.433
We have to send out some pages.

17:34.567 --> 17:39.100
Steve, last time I rushed it,
the message wasn't ready.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.967
And finally, I've received
the word of God.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.933
And this is gonna be
the most sacred revelation
in human history.

17:45.067 --> 17:47.700
-It's gotta be right!
-I know, but I am telling you--

17:47.833 --> 17:50.600
And I'm telling you
you'll get it when it's done!

18:04.233 --> 18:07.800
Because under him and for him...

18:09.167 --> 18:11.533
all things were created.

18:14.067 --> 18:17.067
[Reno] You're telling me
you've exhausted every other
possible option?

18:17.167 --> 18:22.067
Negotiations
have reached an impasse,
Madam Attorney General.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.767
You're asking me
to sign off on an assault that
would put children in danger.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.367
I wouldn't call it an assault.

18:28.500 --> 18:32.367
Once we insert
tear gas into the compound,
they'll come right out.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.233
I thought you said
they all had gas masks in there.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.833
Nobody makes a gas mask
that'll fit children.

18:41.833 --> 18:45.733
Once those mothers
see those kids' eyes
watering like that,

18:45.867 --> 18:46.933
game over.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.633
[Reno] Wouldn't that hurt them?

18:48.767 --> 18:52.067
We believe
it's the best option available.

18:55.367 --> 19:00.600
Our intelligence shows
they continue to abuse
those children while we wait.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.867
There's no other way
to end this?

19:09.333 --> 19:11.467
I'm afraid it's the only way.

19:18.133 --> 19:22.800
-Let me take this
to the president.
-Thank you, Madam General.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.667
[indistinct radio chatter]

20:05.167 --> 20:08.467
There are barrels of CS gas
out there.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.133
This thing needs to be brought
to a logical conclusion.

20:11.267 --> 20:14.667
CS gas is banned
by the Geneva Convention.

20:15.500 --> 20:20.267
It would be a war crime
to use CS gas on a terrorist.

20:20.400 --> 20:24.867
And you think it's
a logical conclusion to use it
on American women and children?

20:25.000 --> 20:28.633
You've had almost two months
to work this out.
And you failed.

20:28.767 --> 20:33.033
What do you mean I failed?
We have a deal for surrender!

20:33.167 --> 20:36.100
Yeah, I know.

20:43.567 --> 20:47.433
All right. Hey! Walter!
Get him on the phone!

20:48.233 --> 20:49.467
-[Gary] Now!
-[Walter] Yeah.

20:51.667 --> 20:55.700
-Hello?
-[Gary] Steve, it's been a week.

20:55.833 --> 20:58.133
You told me you were gonna
get me some pages.

20:58.267 --> 21:04.067
-[sighs] I know, but David--
-Nuh-uh, uh-uh!
I need the pages.

21:04.133 --> 21:07.133
Gary, David really
wants to get this right
before he sends--

21:07.267 --> 21:12.200
I don't give a shit
what David wants anymore!
I need those pages!

21:12.333 --> 21:15.733
The last time
he sent out a message,
he was embarrassed,

21:15.867 --> 21:17.733
and you saw how that turned out.

21:17.867 --> 21:20.600
Why not give him
the time that he needs
so that he can get it right?

21:20.733 --> 21:25.433
We don't have time anymore.
Get me the pages now, Steve.

21:25.567 --> 21:29.767
I am trying to help you people,
but you make it so goddamn hard.

21:29.900 --> 21:34.333
-Do you have any idea what is--?
-[line beeping]

21:36.233 --> 21:37.600
Hello?

21:38.733 --> 21:39.800
Steve?

21:49.967 --> 21:52.733
You've gotten
a little too close to this one.

21:54.533 --> 21:56.333
I'm sending you home.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.367
Uh-uh, I'm not leaving.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.633
[Mitch] Gary...

22:02.967 --> 22:05.400
Please don't make me
have my guys do it.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.600
You cannot remove these people
by force.

22:14.533 --> 22:19.367
The more you push them,
the more they think it is
a test of their faith.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.733
You've been wrong
about a whole lot of things
on this one, Gary.

22:31.133 --> 22:35.600
Don't do it, Tony.
Don't go in there with gas.

22:37.433 --> 22:40.267
This isn't your fight
any longer, Gary.

22:58.933 --> 23:00.333
All right.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.400
Let's pack it up.

23:09.167 --> 23:10.933
They asked me to stay.

23:13.900 --> 23:14.800
Oh.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.533
[Gary] Oh, Jesus.

23:35.367 --> 23:36.667
You know...

23:38.500 --> 23:40.533
before this...

23:42.100 --> 23:45.133
before all the tanks

23:45.267 --> 23:49.333
and psy-ops and guns...

23:50.233 --> 23:52.200
and cruelty...

23:53.900 --> 23:55.667
and bullshit...

23:57.733 --> 24:00.933
do you know how they kept order
in Waco?

24:01.067 --> 24:05.333
Do you know how they kept
the Branch Davidians in line?

24:07.667 --> 24:09.533
They talked to 'em!

24:11.400 --> 24:15.733
The local sheriff
doesn't even carry a sidearm.
He doesn't need one.

24:15.867 --> 24:17.533
But you people...

24:19.500 --> 24:22.067
Look at yourselves! All this!

24:23.067 --> 24:24.733
All this!

24:29.800 --> 24:32.267
You think
this is really working?

24:33.833 --> 24:35.067
Good luck.

25:17.967 --> 25:21.067
David,
it's the FBI on the phone.

25:21.167 --> 25:23.333
I've agreed to everything.

25:27.233 --> 25:29.567
But they won't stop.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.667
It sounds important.

25:35.867 --> 25:40.333
-Gary?
-No, it's Walter.
Gary's been reassigned.

25:40.467 --> 25:42.700
Reassigned? Why?

25:42.833 --> 25:46.600
David, I need to tell you
that my bosses have run out
of patience with you.

25:46.733 --> 25:50.233
Every day, we try
and show you men good faith,

25:50.367 --> 25:52.333
but all you want to do is fight.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.800
I'm tired.
I don't wanna fight no more.

25:54.933 --> 25:57.667
I'm a life.
Everyone in here is a life.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.667
We've got children.
We're American citizens.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.300
But we all have
our breaking point.

26:02.433 --> 26:04.767
You brought yourself
to that breaking point, David.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.833
If you'd walked out on that day
as you promised,

26:06.967 --> 26:08.833
by now,
you'd probably be out on bail
for God's sake!

26:08.967 --> 26:11.067
We both know that's not true.

26:11.133 --> 26:13.600
You got your guys out here
removing evidences,

26:13.733 --> 26:17.133
you say you're the government,
you wanna settle this
in a court of law,

26:17.267 --> 26:19.133
but I don't believe it anymore!

26:19.267 --> 26:23.333
Are you covering up for the ATF?
Because it appears that way,
Walter.

26:23.467 --> 26:27.233
-We're not
removing evidence, David.
-You are removing evidences!

26:27.367 --> 26:29.967
And there's things in here
that we can't replace!

26:30.100 --> 26:33.800
Like that '68 SS El Camino!
You can't replace that!

26:33.933 --> 26:35.533
They don't make those anymore!

26:35.667 --> 26:37.333
I don't really have control
over that, David.

26:37.467 --> 26:41.600
It's wrong,
and you're doing wrong
by God and by man,

26:41.733 --> 26:44.067
and every day,
you're adding to your wrong!

26:44.133 --> 26:50.267
-David, you're the one
who's doing wrong.
-No, no, no, no!

26:50.400 --> 26:51.633
No!

26:51.767 --> 26:53.267
David, you seem to have
no concern

26:53.400 --> 26:55.900
about anybody within
that place except yourself!

26:59.600 --> 27:04.733
Walter, please tell me...

27:06.067 --> 27:10.133
what is it you men really want?

27:10.267 --> 27:15.433
We want you and everyone else
in that place to come out
safely.

27:15.567 --> 27:19.733
Well, you're not showing me
that that's what you want.

27:19.867 --> 27:23.167
Because I believe
you want just the opposite.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.067
That's not true, David.

27:25.200 --> 27:29.400
Your commanders are fixing
to ruin the safety of me
and my children,

27:29.533 --> 27:31.967
my life, the lives of my wives,

27:32.100 --> 27:36.067
the lives of my family,
the lives of my friends.

27:37.567 --> 27:42.900
You all are fixing
to step across that ribbon,
and you know it!

27:43.067 --> 27:46.633
Walter,
if you want to place this
in the history books

27:46.767 --> 27:49.800
as one of the saddest days
the world's ever known...

27:50.667 --> 27:52.467
then that's on you.

27:54.067 --> 27:55.800
-David...
-[hangs up]

28:04.733 --> 28:10.700
[electronic distortion,
pulsation]

28:15.867 --> 28:17.600
[man shouting in distance]

28:31.767 --> 28:35.133
[phone ringing]

28:35.267 --> 28:36.567
[ringing continues]

28:36.700 --> 28:38.167
Hello?

28:38.300 --> 28:40.067
[Walter] I need to speak
to Steve right away.

28:41.100 --> 28:43.500
Steve! Steve!

28:43.633 --> 28:45.533
Tanks are coming right at us!

28:45.667 --> 28:46.867
Shit!

28:51.300 --> 28:53.433
This is Steve.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.133
[Walter] Steve, we
are going to insert
tear gas into your building.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.767
-What?
-This is not an assault.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.567
We are not
entering your building.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.367
-Do not fire your weapon.
-No.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.467
-If you fire,
fire will be returned.
-No, no!

29:02.600 --> 29:05.200
-No, we had
a deal for surrender!
-This is not an assault.

29:05.333 --> 29:06.967
We had a deal!

29:08.233 --> 29:09.733
Son of a bitch!

29:21.533 --> 29:24.367
Everyone,
get your gas masks! Now!

29:33.200 --> 29:34.500
David?

29:35.733 --> 29:37.767
-David, wake up.
-Hm?

29:37.900 --> 29:41.933
-They're gonna gas us.
-What? Gas us?

29:42.067 --> 29:44.133
[Steve] I mean they're coming
with gas.

29:44.267 --> 29:46.967
-All right,
get Walter back on the phone.
-No, it cut off.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.833
Cut off?
What do you mean "cut off"?

29:48.967 --> 29:50.933
I got mad,
and I ripped out the phone.

29:51.067 --> 29:53.700
-Why would you do that, Steve?
-They're done talking!

29:53.833 --> 29:56.067
Okay, then, men in the chapel,
women in the vault.

29:56.133 --> 29:57.967
We need to wet the blankets
to protect the children

29:58.100 --> 30:00.267
-from the gas, okay?
-No, no, we gotta get out
of here.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.633
They're trying to stop me
from getting the message out,
okay?

30:02.767 --> 30:06.467
-I need more time.
-David, we gotta leave.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.667
Stay with me, okay?
Stay with me!

30:09.800 --> 30:11.067
Let's keep moving!

30:11.867 --> 30:13.800
-I need to use that PA!
-I can't authorize--

30:13.933 --> 30:15.767
I'm authorizing it!

30:18.867 --> 30:22.800
This is not an assault.
The siege is over now.

30:22.933 --> 30:26.733
The gas you will be smelling
is a non-lethal tear gas.

30:26.867 --> 30:30.600
Exit the compound now.
You will not be harmed.

30:30.733 --> 30:33.333
This is not an assault.

30:33.467 --> 30:34.967
Michelle! Michelle!

30:36.500 --> 30:38.500
Get to the vault!
Go, go, go! Go!

30:40.500 --> 30:41.933
[women screaming]

30:43.167 --> 30:47.133
[Walter over PA]
This is not an assault.
Exit the compound now.

30:47.267 --> 30:48.600
Come on, let's go.

30:54.733 --> 30:57.733
Come on, let's go.
Come on. Come on.

31:02.633 --> 31:04.067
Put this on your face, okay?

31:10.200 --> 31:13.800
-Okay.
-Where are you going?
Don't leave us.

31:13.933 --> 31:17.067
Stay safe. I'll come back, okay?
I'll come back.

31:17.200 --> 31:21.167
[sobbing]

31:22.600 --> 31:23.833
It's okay.

31:37.733 --> 31:39.067
Get back.

31:53.067 --> 31:57.933
[Walter speaking indistinctly
over PA]

32:02.700 --> 32:04.833
[man on TV] ...has been
standing by in Waco, Texas

32:04.967 --> 32:06.933
for the entire duration
of the standoff.

32:07.067 --> 32:10.067
-She joins us now live.
-[woman] John, about
five minutes ago,

32:10.200 --> 32:13.367
we saw tanks continuing
to batter the compound,

32:13.500 --> 32:17.933
continuing to put gaping holes
into the walls of the structure.

32:18.067 --> 32:20.867
We saw what looked like white,
wispy smoke coming out,

32:21.067 --> 32:23.267
which usually is indicative
of tear gas.

32:23.400 --> 32:28.167
The FBI has told us that they
are using non-lethal gas...
[voice fading out]

32:31.667 --> 32:34.267
-[woman screaming]
-[baby crying]

32:34.400 --> 32:35.767
Rachel?

32:37.733 --> 32:39.333
Oh, my God! Rachel!

32:39.467 --> 32:42.767
[Rachel sobbing]

32:42.900 --> 32:44.267
Put your hands--
Put your hands here.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.233
Judy, get the kids--
get the kids out of here.

32:47.367 --> 32:49.667
Put your hands here.
I'm gonna pull your body out.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.600
-Both of your hands, Rachel.
-I can't! Stop--

32:52.733 --> 32:54.367
[both grunting]

32:54.500 --> 32:56.967
-[sobbing]
-[loud explosion]

33:03.933 --> 33:05.933
[Judy] We gotta get
to that vault.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.367
Get up. I got you.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.233
-[Cyrus] My eyes!
-[Rachel] Cover them!

33:10.367 --> 33:12.667
[Judy] David told us
to go to the vault, Rachel.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.700
[Rachel] Keep your eyes covered.

33:16.767 --> 33:20.233
-Rachel!
-[sobbing]

33:20.367 --> 33:21.833
No! No!

33:23.167 --> 33:25.733
Enough! I am getting my kids
out of here!

33:25.867 --> 33:28.733
We're going
to the storm shelter.
Come on, come on.

33:28.867 --> 33:31.167
I want to come with you!

33:31.300 --> 33:34.400
[Ron] Looks like the tanks
are, uh, knocking out the walls.

33:34.533 --> 33:37.167
I'm not sure how much longer
the structure will hold...

33:38.300 --> 33:43.433
The FBI is reporting
they're receiving heavy gunfire
from the Branch Davidians.

33:43.567 --> 33:46.200
-Who's... Who's firing?
-If you're still
listening in there,

33:46.333 --> 33:48.367
-you're lives are at stake.
-[loud rumbling]

33:48.500 --> 33:50.567
[Walter over PA]
Gas will be continue
to be delivered until everyone

33:50.700 --> 33:52.100
is out of that building.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.933
Heat signature shows people
gathering in the bunker.

33:57.067 --> 33:59.333
Gas isn't penetrating there.

33:59.467 --> 34:01.867
Gas the bunk.
I need you to gas the bunker.

34:03.067 --> 34:06.900
[Walter on PA] We have
no intention of entering
the building at this time.

34:07.067 --> 34:10.400

34:10.533 --> 34:15.300

-No! Cyrus!

34:48.867 --> 34:50.167
Rachel!

34:55.167 --> 34:58.300
-[Walter on PA]
This is not an assault.
-Why isn't anyone coming out?

34:58.433 --> 35:02.900
-They should be coming out.
-[Walter speaking indistinctly
on PA]

35:03.067 --> 35:04.667
Why aren't they coming out?

35:04.800 --> 35:07.833
[baby crying]

35:09.633 --> 35:11.233
Okay, get outside!

35:12.067 --> 35:13.333
Get outside!

35:17.300 --> 35:18.867
Cyrus!

35:22.233 --> 35:23.967

35:50.300 --> 35:52.533
-[man] Ronnie,
for the last 15 minutes...
-My God.

35:52.667 --> 35:55.600
...we watched this M60 vehicle,
this combat engineering vehicle,

35:55.733 --> 35:57.867
uh, pump tear gas in there.

35:58.067 --> 36:02.300
Uh, at times, as you well know,
tear gas can be incendiary.

36:13.633 --> 36:16.267
[loud rumbling]

36:20.233 --> 36:22.800
[man] We have
a very large-scale fire
breaking out

36:22.933 --> 36:24.467
on what must be the southside,

36:24.600 --> 36:26.500
right near the front side
of this building.

36:26.633 --> 36:29.367
Uh, these-- these are
some amazing pictures here.

36:29.500 --> 36:34.300
Uh, a fire has broken out,
and, uh, let's just stay
with this, and...

36:37.500 --> 36:38.733
Michelle!

36:38.867 --> 36:41.367
Thibs, wait! Wait!

36:51.567 --> 36:52.667
Michelle!

37:02.067 --> 37:05.333

37:05.467 --> 37:08.600

-Help!

37:08.733 --> 37:12.867
We're trapped, Rachel!
We're trapped! Help!

37:13.067 --> 37:18.400
Come out now! Save yourselves!
It's time to come out, David!

37:18.533 --> 37:23.467
Rachel, Rachel! No! No! No!

37:23.600 --> 37:24.967
No!

37:43.433 --> 37:45.633
[Walter speaking indistinctly
over PA]

37:58.067 --> 38:00.233
[Walter] This is not an assault.

38:32.300 --> 38:35.900
[Michelle sobbing]

38:36.067 --> 38:40.200
Wake up! Wake up!

39:20.267 --> 39:22.533

39:43.200 --> 39:44.833
[Thibodeau] Michelle!

40:05.567 --> 40:08.233
[man] 95 people believed
to be inside this building.

40:08.367 --> 40:10.333
17 of those 95 people, children.

40:10.467 --> 40:14.100
-[Carol] Oh, my God.
-[man] 37 people have left
the compound

40:14.233 --> 40:17.267
since the standoff began
51 days ago.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.133
Oh, no. Oh, no.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.100
-Michelle!
-Where are the kids? Where--

40:27.233 --> 40:28.567
-Michelle!
-No. Where are the kids?

40:28.700 --> 40:30.033
-Michelle!
-Tell us! Where are the kids?

40:30.167 --> 40:32.633
Cyrus? [sobbing]

-Okay. Okay. Okay.

41:14.933 --> 41:16.200

41:16.333 --> 41:19.367
Somebody help me!
We got kids down here!

41:21.600 --> 41:25.067
My son's not moving.
Is he dead? Is he dead?

41:25.167 --> 41:27.300
Somebody help me!

41:27.433 --> 41:30.700
-Just, please,
get my boy, please!
-I'm gonna get you out of there.

41:30.833 --> 41:34.567

Somebody help me!

41:47.067 --> 41:48.300
[Mitch] Help!

41:52.600 --> 41:54.633

[coughing]

43:25.667 --> 43:28.233
[loud explosion in distance]

43:42.067 --> 43:43.067
[Steve screams]

43:43.200 --> 43:47.533
[sobbing]

44:06.833 --> 44:08.067
[gun fires]

44:40.433 --> 44:42.900
[sobbing]

45:12.200 --> 45:15.800
[Prince] The following persons
have come out of the compound.

45:15.933 --> 45:20.867
Jamie Castillo,
date of birth 6/4/68.

45:21.067 --> 45:24.700
Clive Doyle,

45:24.833 --> 45:28.500
Misty Ferguson, 16 years of age.

45:28.633 --> 45:33.067
Derrick Lovelock,
born 8/13/1955.

45:33.167 --> 45:35.967
A citizen of the United Kingdom.

45:37.133 --> 45:40.267
-David Thibodeau...
-Oh, yes!

45:40.400 --> 45:44.100
-Yes!
-...born 2/13/69.

45:44.233 --> 45:46.133
[sighs]

45:46.267 --> 45:49.800
There are no other
confirmed survivors
at this time.

45:49.933 --> 45:52.233
[people gasping]

45:52.367 --> 45:54.767
And I'm sorry to report

45:54.900 --> 45:58.867
that none of the children
made it out.

46:00.600 --> 46:02.067
Unfortunately...

46:03.167 --> 46:08.600
we were unable to prevent
this tragic mass suicide.

46:09.900 --> 46:12.600
The FBI and the Branch Davidians

46:12.733 --> 46:16.400
each claim the other
started the fire.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.133
And we may never know the truth.

46:19.267 --> 46:23.733
So, instead,
let's talk about
what we do know.

46:25.533 --> 46:29.567
Fact: Fresno, California, 1973.

46:29.700 --> 46:31.333
A standoff
with law enforcement ends

46:31.467 --> 46:35.467
when tear gas turns to fire,
killing those inside.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.667
Fact: Los Angeles, '74.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.133
Standoff between the SLA
and law enforcement ends

46:40.267 --> 46:43.367
when tear gas turns to fire,
killing those inside.

46:43.500 --> 46:48.667
Fact: '81, West Fork, Arkansas.
A standoff, tear gas,
fire, death.

46:48.800 --> 46:53.133
1983, Smithfield, Arkansas.
1985, Philadelphia.

46:53.267 --> 46:56.500
1987, Escondido, California.

46:56.633 --> 46:58.067
All of them...

46:58.167 --> 47:03.867
standoff, tear gas,
fire, death.

47:04.667 --> 47:07.367
The FBI knows this happens,

47:07.500 --> 47:11.100
and yet they made no plan...

47:11.233 --> 47:13.600
to put out a fire...

47:15.500 --> 47:17.200
if one started.

47:21.833 --> 47:25.133
We are... all of us...

47:26.100 --> 47:27.200
Americans.

47:29.700 --> 47:33.800
When did we start seeing
each other as the enemy?

47:37.167 --> 47:38.600
[gate buzzing]

48:46.167 --> 48:47.300
Gary Noesner?

48:49.067 --> 48:50.633
They're ready
for your testimony.

48:52.700 --> 48:53.867
Thank you.
