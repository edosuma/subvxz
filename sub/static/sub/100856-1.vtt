- Howdy, boys.

03:19.416 --> 03:20.461
You guys got here fast.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.550
- Thanks, thanks, we try.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.858
I assume you're Jasper,
you called about that cut.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.208
- What?

03:28.295 --> 03:29.992
- I asked if your
name was Jasper.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.300
You called us to take a look
at that cut on your chest.

03:33.387 --> 03:34.518
- I'm Jasper.

03:37.260 --> 03:40.263
Yeah, I'm, yeah, yeah,
yeah, but it's not for me,

03:40.350 --> 03:41.873
you see, it's for her.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.397
- Her, did you say her?

03:43.484 --> 03:46.574
- I called, I called
for, I called for her,

03:46.661 --> 03:49.316
for her, inside, I
didn't call for me.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.621
- What?

03:50.708 --> 03:52.580
- Oh, come in, come
in, yeah, yeah.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.888
Come on, guys.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.673
She's, uh, she's through there.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.501
She's in the
bathroom, she's not,

04:00.588 --> 04:02.329
she's not dead.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.026
She's just like sleeping now.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.636
I don't know, you need to
wake her up, I don't know.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.072
I mean, you go ahead and
make yourselves at home.

-  This
would be a lot easier

04:50.681 --> 04:52.074
if we had some context.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.293
-  What, fuck!

04:53.380 --> 04:54.729
What?

04:54.816 --> 04:56.774
- Could you tell me
what happened to her?

04:56.861 --> 04:58.298
Hey, hey, hey.

05:03.172 --> 05:06.306
Hey, hey, uh, can you please
just tell me what happened?

05:06.393 --> 05:08.612
Can you let me know
what happened here?

05:08.699 --> 05:10.266
-  Oh, she passed out.

05:10.353 --> 05:12.181
- Yeah, I can see
that, thank you,

05:12.268 --> 05:13.443
but where is she bleeding?

05:13.530 --> 05:15.010
- That's not hers, it's mine.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.231
I cut myself.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.537
- In a downward stabbing motion.

05:20.624 --> 05:21.451
- Yeah.

05:28.023 --> 05:28.850
- What's her name?

05:28.937 --> 05:29.764
-  Uh, Nikki.

05:32.419 --> 05:35.030
- Nikki, hey, can you hear me?

05:35.117 --> 05:37.119
Can you look at me, honey?

05:37.206 --> 05:38.555
Is she on any drugs?

05:38.642 --> 05:39.904
- No, she doesn't do,
she's not on drugs.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.384
I mean, she can't
do drugs right now.

05:41.471 --> 05:42.646
- Why not, she pregnant?

05:44.735 --> 05:46.476
- What, no, what, what, no,

05:46.563 --> 05:48.783
why would you think, why would
you jump to that conclusion

05:48.870 --> 05:50.262
that she's pregnant?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.568
- Nikki, hey.
- Well, you said she can't

05:51.655 --> 05:53.396
do any drugs.
- Can you hear me?

05:53.483 --> 05:55.006
- She passed out because she
doesn't like blood, that's all.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.660
I mean, does she look
pregnant to you right now?

05:56.747 --> 05:58.401
I mean, is that a body
that looks pregnant to you?

05:58.488 --> 05:59.837
I mean, look.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.317
- Relax, okay, we're
just talking here.

06:01.404 --> 06:02.797
I'm just trying to get
the facts straight.

06:02.884 --> 06:03.928
- Well, let's just
get her straight first

06:04.015 --> 06:04.973
and then we'll worry
about the facts.

06:05.060 --> 06:05.582
- Welcome back, sweetheart.

06:05.669 --> 06:06.540
Hey, hi.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.369
Can you tell me your name?

06:10.544 --> 06:11.893
- Who the fuck are you?

06:11.980 --> 06:13.460
- My name is Marcus
Steadman, all right,

06:13.547 --> 06:15.157
this is my partner Sebastian.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.854
We're just here to
help, all right.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.073
It looks like you fainted,
maybe bumped your head.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.031
- Get the fuck out of my house.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.079
- All right, well, I'd say
we can rule out a concussion.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.995
You're probably going to have
a little bit of bruising.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.823
You know, probably a
little bit of a headache

06:28.910 --> 06:30.172
from the fall.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.304
- Oh God, why am
I laying in blood.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.828
What is this?

06:33.915 --> 06:35.482
- Well, it seems that
Jasper here had himself

06:35.569 --> 06:36.570
a little knife accident.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.180
- Hey, baby, how you doing?

06:38.267 --> 06:39.442
How you feeling,
baby, are you okay?

06:39.529 --> 06:40.574
Are you hurting?

06:41.488 --> 06:42.837
Does your head feel better?

06:42.924 --> 06:45.187
- You're fucking high
again, aren't you?

06:45.274 --> 06:46.231
- Wait, I'm not, I'm not high.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.624
I mean, I thought about it.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.365
I mean, of course
I thought about it

06:49.452 --> 06:50.540
cause you were, you know, I
was stressed out about you

06:50.627 --> 06:51.976
so I thought about
doing, and it's here,

06:52.063 --> 06:53.325
but I didn't do any
of it, I promise you.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.850
I didn't, baby,
I'm sober, I swear,

06:55.937 --> 06:57.329
I'm sober, okay.
- Help me up.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.462
Get me up, help me
up, please, thank you.

06:59.549 --> 07:03.031
All right, don't you fucking
start with me right now.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.685
- Oh, thanks for looking
out, baby, I love you, too.

07:04.772 --> 07:05.729
Sorry about that.

07:05.816 --> 07:06.774
- You're being sarcastic.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.210
- I'm not being sarcastic.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.298
I don't, I don't know
who these guys are.

07:09.385 --> 07:10.386
They just, they're here now.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.040
I messed up, I'm sorry, babe.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.824
- Oh, wow, great, you
promised me you were done

07:13.911 --> 07:14.912
with this shit.
- Oh, God!

07:14.999 --> 07:16.697
It's not my fault.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.481
- It's not, it's not your fault?

07:18.568 --> 07:20.222
Okay, well then who
the fuck's fault is it?

07:20.309 --> 07:22.006
Who else would bring
30 pounds of cocaine

07:22.093 --> 07:22.920
into my kitchen?

07:23.007 --> 07:24.531
Did you guys do this?

07:24.618 --> 07:25.880
Get in here.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.534
- Babe, baby, there's
a lot going on!

07:27.621 --> 07:29.492
I panicked, you hit your
head, you passed out,

07:29.579 --> 07:31.059
I freaked out so I did.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.539
You passed out, not me.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.105
-  Stop hiding!

07:34.192 --> 07:35.367
- I'm not hiding.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.892
-  Stop
hiding, get in here.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.067
- No.

07:39.154 --> 07:41.548
-  Get in here!

07:41.635 --> 07:43.071
- I'm coming.

07:43.158 --> 07:44.725
-  Just please
shut the fuck up.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.727
- Look, baby, I'm
done, all right?

07:46.814 --> 07:49.251
- Please, what the fuck?

07:49.338 --> 07:52.080
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
and, look, I promise you

07:52.167 --> 07:54.691
that as soon as
this stuff is done,

07:54.778 --> 07:56.084
I'm done with it forever.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.607
My lips to God's
ears, I promise you,

07:57.694 --> 07:59.087
scout's honor, it's not
gonna happen anymore.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.349
Look, I thought I
lost you back there

08:00.436 --> 08:01.785
so I freaked out a little bit!

08:01.872 --> 08:02.873
So what, I did a little
coke, that's all.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.179
I was worried about you!

08:04.266 --> 08:05.180
- You didn't almost
lose anything.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.311
I fucking passed out.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.575
Christ, you fucking called 911?

08:08.662 --> 08:09.924
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

08:10.011 --> 08:11.360
- Baby--
- Are you crazy?

08:11.447 --> 08:12.753
What were you thinking?
- You passed out!

08:12.840 --> 08:13.623
What do you think
happens when you die?

08:13.710 --> 08:15.016
You pass out first.

08:15.103 --> 08:15.886
I thought that's
what you would want.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.584
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:17.671 --> 08:19.281
-  30 pounds of coke!

08:19.368 --> 08:20.630
- Hi, I hate to interrupt

08:20.717 --> 08:22.502
your little domestic
dispute, guys,

08:22.589 --> 08:24.373
but I'm just gonna
need one of you guys

08:24.460 --> 08:25.896
to sign this, saying
everything's all right,

08:25.983 --> 08:27.637
and then we'll be
out of your hair.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.683
- Well, wait, what, you
have to report this?

08:29.770 --> 08:30.988
We're fine.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.337
- We're fine.
- There's no need

08:32.424 --> 08:34.035
for papers and shit.
- Yeah, I mean,

08:34.122 --> 08:37.429
you guys are great, but
if I want to keep my job,

08:37.517 --> 08:39.562
then, yeah, I'm gonna
need to report this.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.134
- Come on.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.309
Can't you just do us a favor

08:47.396 --> 08:49.746
and just forget about this one?

08:49.833 --> 08:52.053
- No, I'm gonna
need you to sign it.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.664
- Okay.

08:54.751 --> 08:57.754
Well, what if we
work something out,

08:59.582 --> 09:02.063
like, uh, financially?

09:03.455 --> 09:05.806
- You guys do have a
little scratch, don't you?

09:05.893 --> 09:07.590
- Just sign the form.

09:07.677 --> 09:08.983
- Look, we're not gonna fucking
sign anything, all right?

09:09.070 --> 09:10.506
We're fine, we
don't want you here,

09:10.593 --> 09:12.203
so fucking, you
know, take our money,

09:12.290 --> 09:14.031
mark this one down
as a false alarm

09:14.118 --> 09:15.990
or leave empty-handed,
up to you.

09:16.077 --> 09:16.991
- How much money?

09:17.078 --> 09:19.080
- What are you doing?

09:19.167 --> 09:20.429
- Come on, Marc.

09:20.516 --> 09:21.952
You looked around this place?

09:22.039 --> 09:24.302
I think they can afford
a little off the top.

09:24.389 --> 09:25.521
Hey, Skippy, what do you do?

09:25.608 --> 09:27.044
- Hmm, I'm in a band.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.480
- He's a musician.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.525
- I don't care what
he does for a living.

09:29.612 --> 09:30.613
I'm not taking their money.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.006
I just need you to sign this

09:32.093 --> 09:33.181
and then we will
gladly be on our way.

09:33.268 --> 09:34.574
- Boys,

09:34.661 --> 09:36.271
nobody here is stupid, okay?

09:36.358 --> 09:37.664
Anyone can take one
look around this place

09:37.751 --> 09:39.274
and see that there's
a lot of explaining

09:39.361 --> 09:41.015
that needs to be done.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.278
Quite honestly, none of
us are really qualified.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.148
- Yeah.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.889
- Enough.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.283
If we sign that thing, this
becomes an insurance issue,

09:48.370 --> 09:50.198
possibly even a
legal issue, right?

09:50.285 --> 09:51.852
I mean, depending on
what you write down.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.376
- I'm not gonna change
what you're seeing in here.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.030
I mean, I'll even
give you a copy.

09:56.117 --> 09:59.207
I just need you to sign
it so I don't lose my job.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.164
- Just change it.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.601
- They ain't lying, man.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.124
This dude's fucking loaded.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.255
I think we oughta
at least consider

10:04.342 --> 10:05.213
what they're talking about here.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.518
- How much you want?

10:06.606 --> 10:09.043
- Just, just sign the form.

10:09.130 --> 10:09.957
- 5,000?

10:10.784 --> 10:11.523
- 10,000.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.047
Cash.

10:13.134 --> 10:13.874
- Deal.

10:13.961 --> 10:14.831
- Deal!
- No.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.180
No.
- Deal, be gone.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.660
- No!

10:17.747 --> 10:19.140
- No?

10:19.227 --> 10:20.707
Marc, that's 10 Gs,
it's more than we make

10:20.794 --> 10:22.447
in a fucking month.

10:22.534 --> 10:23.927
- Yeah, and that might be
all the money we ever make

10:24.014 --> 10:25.625
if we get caught.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.278
- We're not gonna get caught,
that's the thing, man,

10:27.365 --> 10:29.629
that's my point, cause
they ain't reporting shit.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.282
Ain't that right?

10:31.369 --> 10:33.545
Cause you got bruises all
up and down your body.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.069
This guy's got a
gash on his chest

10:35.156 --> 10:36.592
the size of Lake Tahoe.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.333
I don't think that's
a fucking coincidence.

10:38.420 --> 10:39.682
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

10:39.769 --> 10:40.944
that's not right,
that's not fair.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.337
I don't, I don't hit
girls, I didn't hit her,

10:42.424 --> 10:43.904
I don't hit girls.
- Not to mention,

10:43.991 --> 10:45.906
the yayo on your
fucking kitchen counter.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.777
- Okay, that's right, this
cannot leave the room,

10:47.864 --> 10:50.258
not for us, it cannot,
it cannot leave the room.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.608
- That, that, I mean.
- Shh!

10:52.695 --> 10:54.828
- Come on, man, you
could take a vacation

10:54.915 --> 10:56.307
for the first time in years.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.048
Think about it. You
know what you could do?

10:58.135 --> 10:59.615
You could finish that
bathroom for Lizzy.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.617
It's very easy, you
just rip up that report,

11:01.704 --> 11:02.662
we walk outta here.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.670
- Fuck it, I'm
getting the money.

11:14.891 --> 11:17.938
- Dude, these are some
great albums you got here.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.069
These all yours?

11:20.070 --> 11:21.463
- Yeah.

11:21.550 --> 11:22.943
Me and Nikki's.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.380
- So aren't you musician
types supposed to be,

11:25.467 --> 11:27.164
like, covered in tattoos.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.775
- I don't know, would
you put a bumper sticker

11:28.862 --> 11:29.732
on a Ferrari?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.301
- So, uh,

11:34.868 --> 11:36.870
what kind of music do you play?

11:36.957 --> 11:39.699
-  I don't
know, probably nothing
you've heard of.

11:39.786 --> 11:40.830
- Oh, I don't know, I
got a teenager at home.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.353
I hear a lot of shit.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.268
- Oh, so you just assume
all my music is shit?

11:44.355 --> 11:45.922
- Oh, I hate to break it to you,

11:46.009 --> 11:49.186
but your outward appearance
doesn't exactly scream

11:49.273 --> 11:50.710
musical genius right now.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.408
- All right, what
about, what about those

11:53.495 --> 11:54.888
gold records on the wall,
huh, how about that,

11:54.975 --> 11:55.802
and the money she's
bringing you right now?

11:55.889 --> 11:57.804
Suck on that dick.

11:57.891 --> 12:00.067
- That's not you
hitting her, is it?

12:00.154 --> 12:01.459
You know, those
bruises on her back?

12:01.546 --> 12:02.678
- I don't hit girls,
I don't do that,

12:02.765 --> 12:04.114
that's not me.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.594
- Cause I don't like
guys who hit girls.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.248
- I don't like guys
who hit girls, either,

12:07.335 --> 12:08.815
and that's why I don't
do it, so leave it alone.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.077
- Then why'd she cut you?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.559
- Because she
doesn't like drugs.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.692
- So stop using.
- What are you, like my dad?

12:16.779 --> 12:19.390
Cause you sound like my dad
but you look like a paramedic,

12:19.477 --> 12:20.478
just so you know.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.350
I called 911, last I checked.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.918
If I wanted my dad to
come, then I'd call him.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.226
- You didn't expect
the baby, did you?

12:29.313 --> 12:31.054
- Hey, she's not pregnant, okay?

12:31.141 --> 12:32.752
She's not pregnant.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.144
Even if she was pregnant,
it's not your business,

12:34.231 --> 12:35.972
and it's not your business.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.018
You know, it's only the couple
having the baby's business,

12:38.105 --> 12:39.759
all right, and, right
now, that couple

12:39.846 --> 12:41.021
having the baby,
we don't even know

12:41.108 --> 12:42.544
who the father is, all right,

12:42.631 --> 12:45.721
so why don't you guys
just take a walk, okay?

12:45.808 --> 12:46.983
- You're bleeding again.

12:57.559 --> 13:00.692
So, look, kid, we're gonna
take your money and walk away,

13:00.780 --> 13:03.478
but, you know, I can't in
any sort of good conscience

13:03.565 --> 13:06.960
leave without at least
fixing up your gash there,

13:07.047 --> 13:08.352
so I'm just gonna
go out to the rig,

13:08.439 --> 13:10.006
get some more gear,
and then come back

13:10.093 --> 13:11.442
and patch you up properly,

13:11.529 --> 13:13.314
so you don't like
bleed out later, okay?

13:13.401 --> 13:15.403
- Are you gonna
give me stitches?

13:15.490 --> 13:17.100
- Probably not.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.536
Just gauze and a little
bit of tape oughta do it.

13:18.623 --> 13:19.668
- I do know, maybe
you should stitch it.

13:19.755 --> 13:20.277
I've never had stitches before.

13:20.364 --> 13:20.800
- Okay.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.280
Well, we will keep that in mind.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.630
- Just in case, as a precaution.

13:32.986 --> 13:33.813
I'm really sorry.

13:36.337 --> 13:37.773
I mean, I never should've
called these fuckers

13:37.860 --> 13:39.209
in the first place, I'm
really sorry for that.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.821
You know what, you
know what I'm gonna do?

13:41.908 --> 13:44.301
I'm gonna pay back
Jasper all that $10,000.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.697
I promise I'm gonna do
that, and you know what?

13:48.784 --> 13:50.481
Even if this little
thing inside of you here

13:50.568 --> 13:52.309
isn't mine, I'm going
to do everything I can

13:52.396 --> 13:55.269
to keep it happy and
healthy and safe, you know,

13:55.356 --> 13:57.488
and all that other
shit, too, you know,

13:57.575 --> 13:59.795
like a good old man will do.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.151
Just one last time.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.355
-  How you doing, pal?

14:38.442 --> 14:40.140
- Oh, I'm ready when you are.

14:40.227 --> 14:41.358
-  All right, great.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.583
Whoa, whoa, that's quite the
pig-sticker you got there.

14:48.670 --> 14:49.976
What is that for?

14:50.063 --> 14:51.064
- Uh, it's just a
little antibiotic,

14:51.151 --> 14:52.021
nothing to get worried about.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.718
-  Oh.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.851
-  Now if you can
just give me your arm here.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.679
-  Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.856
-  Now, Jasper, if you
can hold really still for me.

15:00.943 --> 15:01.857
- Yeah.
- Can you do that?

15:01.944 --> 15:02.858
-  Yeah.

15:03.859 --> 15:04.816
Okay.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.296
You want me to make a fist?

15:06.383 --> 15:08.516
- That's good, right there.

15:08.603 --> 15:11.171
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, oh, just real quick,

15:11.258 --> 15:13.869
I mean, that's not gonna
like cause like a reaction

15:13.956 --> 15:15.349
or something, you
know what I mean,

15:15.436 --> 15:17.090
like, you know, that
blow in the kitchen,

15:17.177 --> 15:19.222
I'm not saying I did it, but
if I did, hypothetically,

15:19.309 --> 15:21.007
you don't think that this
would cause like my blood

15:21.094 --> 15:22.443
to boil like a
speedball or something,

15:22.530 --> 15:24.880
I mean, you know, fucked
up, right, or die,

15:24.967 --> 15:26.273
you know, like hypothetically?

15:26.360 --> 15:27.970
- Hypothetically?
- Yeah.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.711
- Hypothetically, I think,
I don't think your heart

15:29.798 --> 15:31.017
will explode.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.192
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.671
- All right.

15:33.758 --> 15:36.283
- Now just stay real
still for me, all right?

15:36.370 --> 15:37.284
How's that feel?

15:40.461 --> 15:42.854
- I'm good, I'm all
good, I'm all good.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.421
-  Good, that's great.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.040
- Are you gonna do it?

15:54.127 --> 15:57.347
- Have you ever heard of
potassium chloride, Jasper?

15:57.434 --> 15:58.522
- Yeah, like a banana.

16:00.524 --> 16:03.353
- Well, yeah, bananas
do have potassium.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.051
That's good,

16:05.138 --> 16:07.444
but, you know, not nearly
as much as this syringe.

16:07.531 --> 16:10.795
You see, potassium chloride
is what the prison system

16:10.882 --> 16:12.710
uses for the death penalty

16:12.797 --> 16:14.886
to kill our most
dangerous criminals.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.978
Guys that get high and
beat and bury their wives.

16:19.065 --> 16:23.460
It's fast-acting and
relatively painless.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.595
- So, like, death row?

16:30.206 --> 16:31.991
Whatever happened
to gauze and tape?

16:34.080 --> 16:35.429
- I have no words.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.300
- Jasper, let me explain
how it is to you.

16:37.387 --> 16:38.693
We went outside just now,

16:38.780 --> 16:42.262
and, well, we came
to a realization.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.133
Any house with 10 grand
just lying around,

16:44.220 --> 16:45.352
the way your wife made it seem--

16:45.439 --> 16:46.701
- What, you guys
want more money,

16:46.788 --> 16:47.615
is that what you're saying?

16:47.702 --> 16:48.485
You want more money?

16:48.572 --> 16:49.704
- He's a genius.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.798
- Oh, fuck, I fainted again.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.801
Oh, what's with the needle,
I fucking hate needles.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.585
- No, baby, baby,
that's what I'm trying--

17:01.672 --> 17:03.109
- Not now, we'll deal with
your fucking apologies later.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.588
I just wanna get these
guys outta my house.

17:04.675 --> 17:05.807
- That's what I'm trying
to tell you about--

17:05.894 --> 17:07.504
- Get them out!

17:07.591 --> 17:08.636
- Baby, they're gonna kill
me with the banana shit!

17:08.723 --> 17:09.550
- What?

17:10.681 --> 17:12.596
- They want more money.

17:17.601 --> 17:20.126
- Oh, okay, all right, all
right, all right, fellas,

17:20.213 --> 17:21.605
I understand what
you're doing here,

17:21.692 --> 17:23.129
but, you know, there
isn't any more money,

17:23.216 --> 17:25.522
so just please get the
fuck out of my house.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.482
- Something tells me that's
probably not entirely true.

17:28.569 --> 17:29.961
- Well, I don't care
what anything tells you,

17:30.049 --> 17:31.267
that's the way it is.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.791
Now take that thing
out of his arm

17:33.878 --> 17:36.142
and please get the
fuck out of my house.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.273
- Yeah, well, uh,

17:40.233 --> 17:42.844
we have a better
idea, sweetheart.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.106
We're gonna take a walk.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.155
- I'm sorry.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.331
- You shouldn't
have called them.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.216
Got a bag?

18:07.303 --> 18:08.957
You forgot a bag?

18:11.046 --> 18:12.613
-  All right,
can I dump this shit?

18:12.700 --> 18:14.310
- No, no, no,
that's my art shit.

18:15.398 --> 18:16.834
- You paint?

18:16.921 --> 18:18.271
- Yeah, a little.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.621
- What kind?

18:20.708 --> 18:22.884
- I'm in abstract
expressionism, Rothko.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.364
- Right on.
- Newman.

18:24.451 --> 18:25.843
- So how many bananas
do you think it takes

18:25.930 --> 18:27.758
to like kill a guy?

18:30.239 --> 18:31.893
- My dad, he was into Pollack.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.024
- He's a little
messy for my taste,

18:33.112 --> 18:34.374
but the same movement, so.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.552
Yeah, I think there's
a bag in there.

18:38.639 --> 18:39.509
Do you want me to just use that?

18:39.596 --> 18:40.597
-  Go for it.

18:40.684 --> 18:41.903
- Okay.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.692
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, take it easy.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.085
- All right, Chucko,
drop the knife

18:50.172 --> 18:51.782
or I'll blow your
fucking head off.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.220
- Really?

18:54.307 --> 18:55.960
- Yeah, really,
what'd you think,

18:56.047 --> 18:57.484
I was going take you down
here and talk postmodern art

18:57.571 --> 18:58.789
and then let you steal
all my hard-earned cash?

18:58.876 --> 18:59.877
- Belize.
- Belize.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.357
They send in all the bananas.

19:01.444 --> 19:04.491
- You mean to make the
banana death juice?

19:04.578 --> 19:06.232
- Yeah.
- Now drop the knife!

19:06.319 --> 19:08.582
- Look at you, you can
barely hold that thing.

19:10.932 --> 19:11.976
- You wanna try me?

19:12.977 --> 19:13.804
- No.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.155
I do think before
we go any further,

19:16.242 --> 19:17.330
you should see something.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.637
- No, no, no, no, no!

19:37.698 --> 19:39.613
- You all right?

19:39.700 --> 19:41.789
- Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm
just bleeding a little.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.269
- Not you, dumb ass,
sit the fuck down!

19:43.356 --> 19:44.574
-  Wait,
wait, where's Nikki?

19:44.661 --> 19:46.663
-  She's
fine, asshole.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.491
- Jesus, where'd you get a gun?

19:48.578 --> 19:50.841
- She pulled it from the safe.
- Oh, was there more money?

19:50.928 --> 19:53.148
- Yeah, there was
a lot more money.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.889
-  Why didn't
you bring it up?

19:55.977 --> 19:57.152
- I forgot a bag.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.371
- You forgot a bag?

19:58.458 --> 20:00.286
Smart guy.
- Shut the fuck up.

20:00.373 --> 20:01.374
- You got a real
thinker of a partner,

20:01.461 --> 20:02.766
I gotta say.
- Shut up!

20:02.853 --> 20:06.161
Grab a bag and pack
it up and let's go.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.207
- Nah, no, not yet,
man, we're not done.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.383
- What are you talking about?

20:10.470 --> 20:11.906
- Look around, all right?

20:11.993 --> 20:13.299
We gotta tie them up,
we gotta see what else

20:13.386 --> 20:14.648
there is to take.
- Tie them up?

20:14.735 --> 20:16.476
Come on, we're not
going anywhere.

20:16.563 --> 20:17.868
- Fuck.
- Can't you just do

20:17.955 --> 20:19.435
what you gotta do
and get the hell out?

20:19.522 --> 20:20.915
-  Baby, I'm
really glad you're okay.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.612
- Shut up, Kyle.

20:22.699 --> 20:23.309
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- How the fuck is Kyle?

20:23.396 --> 20:24.179
- Fucking Kyle?

20:24.266 --> 20:25.485
- I'm Kyle.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.012
- Just rob us already!

20:31.099 --> 20:32.579
- I'm fucking confused.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.015
- You know, I gotta
say, you guys,

20:34.102 --> 20:36.322
it seems a little,
you know, excessive.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.454
I mean, she told you
to rob the place,

20:38.541 --> 20:39.934
and I'm not about to
do anything about it

20:40.021 --> 20:41.414
any time soon, so I
really don't understand

20:41.501 --> 20:43.677
why you guys are
tying us up to chairs.

20:43.764 --> 20:44.634
- You know, I can see
why she doesn't like you

20:44.721 --> 20:46.114
getting high.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.507
You just can't keep
your fucking mouth shut.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.117
- That, all right.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.816
I'll keep my mouth shut.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.992
- So, who's hitting you?

20:55.079 --> 20:56.864
Jasper or Kyle?

20:56.951 --> 20:58.518
- Fuck you, what do you care?

20:58.605 --> 20:59.693
- I don't like
guys who hit girls.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.129
You shouldn't have to take that.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.349
- Oh, yo, okay, that's
real sound advice

21:03.436 --> 21:05.960
from the guy who was
threatening to stop my heart

21:06.047 --> 21:07.570
with the banana death juice.

21:07.657 --> 21:10.007
- All that was in that
syringe was saline.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.706
The worst thing it would've
done is rehydrate you.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.318
- Really?

21:16.405 --> 21:17.928
- All right, are we
done fucking around?

21:18.015 --> 21:18.842
May we?

21:20.235 --> 21:22.629
- I, we'll be out
of your way shortly.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.859
- Hey, I think that was
a good move with the gun.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.774
You know, it was worth a try.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.038
I mean, he was a big guy,
but it was worth a try.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.609
Come on, I mean, come
on, I got your signal

21:46.696 --> 21:48.045
with the finger gun
thing, you know?

21:48.132 --> 21:49.525
Come on, we were on
the same wavelength.

21:49.612 --> 21:50.918
I mean, can you at
least acknowledge that

21:51.005 --> 21:52.398
we're on the same wavelength?

21:52.485 --> 21:53.877
Fuck, come on, don't
be mad at me, please,

21:53.964 --> 21:55.357
please don't be mad,
please don't be mad,

21:55.444 --> 21:56.880
please don't be fucking
mad at me, come on!

21:56.967 --> 21:58.665
I didn't want this either!
- I'm not mad, I'm not mad!

21:58.752 --> 21:59.535
Okay?

22:02.277 --> 22:03.191
I'm sad.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.937
I'm really fucking sad.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.596
- The reason I started
back on the drugs

22:16.683 --> 22:17.988
was because you told
me that, you know,

22:18.075 --> 22:19.816
I might not be the father, so.

22:19.903 --> 22:22.079
- I'm married, Kyle, of
course you might not be

22:22.166 --> 22:23.559
the fucking father!

22:23.646 --> 22:24.995
- All right, yeah, I
forgot you're married

22:25.082 --> 22:27.824
to the douche bag,
wife-beating rockstar

22:27.911 --> 22:28.869
fucking--
- Okay, well, at least he is

22:28.956 --> 22:30.697
who he fucking says he is!

22:30.784 --> 22:31.611
- Oh.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.353
That hurts, Nikki.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.182
That fucking hurts.

22:41.229 --> 22:44.450
You gotta know, I mean, this
isn't easy for me, either.

22:44.537 --> 22:45.886
You know?

22:45.973 --> 22:48.018
And you comparing my
one little mistake

22:48.105 --> 22:51.021
to his lifetime of insanity
isn't exactly fair.

22:51.108 --> 22:54.111
I mean, you gotta kind of agree
with me on that one, right?

22:54.198 --> 22:56.331
I mean, come on, right?

22:57.550 --> 22:58.464
- Wiggle with me.

22:58.551 --> 22:59.378
- What?

22:59.465 --> 23:00.291
- Trust me, trust me.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.989
- Wiggle?

23:02.076 --> 23:03.207
- Yes, wiggle, yes, just
back and forth like this.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.644
Go right.
- I'm wiggling.

23:04.731 --> 23:05.993
- No, go like this.
- Oh, you mean rock.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.908
- No, okay, fine, rock.
- Rock.

23:07.995 --> 23:08.822
Rock the fucking chair.
- Rock, I got it,

23:08.909 --> 23:10.563
you want me to rock.

23:10.650 --> 23:11.607
Okay, I'm fucking rocking.
- Back and forth, come on.

23:11.694 --> 23:12.521
- Why is it fucking tied?

23:12.608 --> 23:14.044
-  Come on, wiggle.

23:14.131 --> 23:16.569
- I'm getting claustrophobia!

23:17.526 --> 23:18.353
Owie.

23:22.313 --> 23:23.880
What are you doing?

23:25.491 --> 23:26.492
You don't have to keep wiggling.

23:26.579 --> 23:27.928
- Shh, shh, stop.

23:37.372 --> 23:38.591
-  Get the money!

23:41.594 --> 23:42.551
- Oh, got it!

23:48.731 --> 23:50.167
Okay, okay, okay,
let's go, let's go.

23:50.254 --> 23:51.212
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait,

23:51.299 --> 23:51.995
wait, wait, Nik, Nik, Nik,

23:52.082 --> 23:53.475
wait.
- What?

23:53.562 --> 23:55.782
- I need to know, I
need to know right now.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.653
If you could pick
who the father was,

23:58.611 --> 23:59.960
would it be me or him?

24:00.047 --> 24:01.701
- Oh, fuck off, you
know I'd choose you.

24:01.788 --> 24:02.789
- Choose me?

24:02.876 --> 24:04.355
I fucking love you to death.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.226
I fucking love you to death.
- Let's be smart

24:05.313 --> 24:06.662
and get out of here

24:06.749 --> 24:07.446
so it doesn't have to
come to that, okay?

24:07.533 --> 24:08.795
- Oh, what the fuck?

24:14.931 --> 24:16.411
- Kyle, we were
going to be smart,

24:16.498 --> 24:17.717
we were gonna leave!

24:17.804 --> 24:19.022
- He was gonna shoot!

24:19.109 --> 24:20.241
- You don't know that!

24:20.328 --> 24:21.372
- He had a gun, Nikki.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.504
I can pretty well fucking guess

24:22.591 --> 24:24.550
that he was going to shoot.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.861
-  No, no, no, no, no.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.366
- Is he okay?

25:17.385 --> 25:18.691
-  Oh my.

25:26.742 --> 25:27.569
- No, no!

25:27.656 --> 25:29.136
No, come on, come on!

25:29.223 --> 25:31.834
Hey, come on, man,
come fucking back.

25:31.921 --> 25:32.661
Fuck!

25:32.748 --> 25:34.358
Fuck!

26:21.231 --> 26:22.058
You okay?

26:25.235 --> 26:26.062
You sure?

26:29.196 --> 26:30.589
- You just killed a guy.

26:30.676 --> 26:34.854
- Well, I, I mean he
was going to kill us.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.986
- I don't really think that
shit matters right now, Kyle,

26:37.073 --> 26:39.685
okay, you're alive,
he's dead, okay,

26:39.772 --> 26:42.252
that's all anyone's gonna
really fucking care about.

26:45.734 --> 26:46.692
- Like legally?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.521
- Yeah, legally, what the
fuck else would I mean?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.349
What else matters right now?

26:52.436 --> 26:54.613
- Everything, everything except
for that matters right now.

26:54.700 --> 26:55.875
We're not gonna call
the fucking cops.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.267
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

26:57.354 --> 26:58.704
- Okay, okay, well
then let's call 911

26:58.791 --> 27:00.706
because that worked
out fucking perfectly

27:00.793 --> 27:02.055
the first time.
- Stop that.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.796
- Remember that,
remember that, huh?

27:03.883 --> 27:05.711
- I said I was fucking sorry,
I'm fucking sorry, okay?

27:05.798 --> 27:07.495
Fuck, Jesus, fuck.

27:07.582 --> 27:10.411
I'm sorry about that, I mean,
come on, what do you want?

27:10.498 --> 27:11.760
We just need to
weigh our options,

27:11.847 --> 27:13.109
we need to fucking
think right now.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.458
So, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:14.545 --> 27:17.157
You're fucking out
of your fucking mind!

27:17.244 --> 27:18.201
You don't drink, remember?

27:18.288 --> 27:19.159
No more fucking drinking.

27:19.246 --> 27:20.682
- You killed somebody!

27:20.769 --> 27:22.815
There's a fucking dead
body right over there

27:22.902 --> 27:23.729
because of you!

27:25.992 --> 27:30.431
- Fuck, no, no, no, no
more fucking drinking.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.695
No fucking drinking, all right?

27:33.782 --> 27:35.262
No fucking drinking.

27:35.349 --> 27:36.655
We've gotta get
our heads together,

27:36.742 --> 27:38.134
we gotta come up
with ideas, you know,

27:38.221 --> 27:39.353
and you know what?

27:39.440 --> 27:40.920
That paramedic guy Marcus,

27:41.007 --> 27:42.661
I mean, he's not
gonna go to the cops,

27:42.748 --> 27:44.314
I mean, because he
was trying to rob us,

27:44.401 --> 27:45.881
so he's just as fucked
as we are, so we're good.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.143
We gotta figure out how
to get rid of that body,

27:47.230 --> 27:48.754
that's all, that's
all we have to do.

27:48.841 --> 27:49.842
Everything's going to be fine.

27:49.929 --> 27:51.234
- Jasper's going to kill me.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.671
- Why?
- Jasper's going to fucking

27:52.758 --> 27:53.628
kill me, I've seen
him do way worse shit

27:53.715 --> 27:55.543
over way less than that.

27:55.630 --> 27:56.979
- Don't worry about
Jasper right now.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.024
Please don't worry
about Jasper right now.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.416
We need to think about us.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.157
We need to think
about me and you,

28:01.244 --> 28:02.942
that's what we need to do
right now, think about us.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.204
- I didn't ask for this.

28:05.727 --> 28:06.772
What the fuck happened?

28:06.859 --> 28:07.990
I just wanted to be us.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.039
- What?

28:15.476 --> 28:16.433
Is someone, what?

28:16.520 --> 28:18.305
Nik, Nikki, hey, Nik!

28:26.922 --> 28:28.271
What are you doing,
what are you doing,

28:28.358 --> 28:29.620
what are you looking
for, what are you?

28:29.708 --> 28:30.752
- Rings, my fucking rings.
- Rings?

28:30.839 --> 28:32.232
- They took my fucking rings!

28:32.319 --> 28:33.363
- Whatever, we'll just
get you more rings.

28:33.450 --> 28:34.277
We'll just buy you more rings,

28:34.364 --> 28:35.714
it's not a big deal.

28:35.801 --> 28:36.976
- You don't understand,
my wedding rings,

28:37.063 --> 28:38.455
my fucking wedding and
engagement rings, Kyle.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.805
I always take them
off when I'm with you,

28:39.892 --> 28:40.936
but you probably
never even noticed

28:41.023 --> 28:42.285
because you're too fucking high!

28:42.372 --> 28:43.634
- Or maybe I never
noticed because you always

28:43.722 --> 28:45.375
take them off when
you're with me.

28:45.462 --> 28:46.028
That's probably why I didn't
notice, babe, that's all.

28:46.115 --> 28:47.726
- Oh my God.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.510
He's gonna kill me. I mean,
I have to get them back.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.251
They're like his
grandmother's or something.

28:51.338 --> 28:52.687
- They were like or they are?

28:52.774 --> 28:54.254
I mean, there's a big
fucking difference

28:54.341 --> 28:55.385
between like and are. I
mean, we could buy like.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.952
- They were his grandmother's.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.649
- All right. Are you sure?
- He's gonna fucking kill me.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.520
- Can they be in another room?
- I mean, he's going

28:59.607 --> 29:00.956
to murder us both.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.131
-  He's not
going to kill anybody.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.654
Nobody's killing
nobody, you're fine.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.481
Everything's fine.

29:04.568 --> 29:05.787
- You just did!

29:08.007 --> 29:09.182
- All right, so let's just
get the fuck outta here,

29:09.269 --> 29:10.487
me and you, right now.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.054
Let's just fucking
get in the car

29:12.141 --> 29:13.839
and fucking take off and
fucking leave this place

29:13.926 --> 29:15.710
so far behind and get
as far away from him

29:15.797 --> 29:17.233
as possible, let's
do that, baby.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.366
- It's not that easy.
- Come on, yeah it is.

29:19.453 --> 29:22.151
I mean, I love you, you love me.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.414
I mean, all you need is love.

29:24.501 --> 29:25.676
- The baby's Jasper's.

29:28.810 --> 29:29.811
- What?

29:51.964 --> 29:52.791
You sure?

29:54.880 --> 29:59.536
- No, look at you, you're
bleeding, you're high.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.408
- You stabbed me.

30:01.495 --> 30:02.713
- You're not a dad, Kyle.

30:04.672 --> 30:07.240
I love you, I love you to death,

30:07.327 --> 30:09.285
but you cannot raise a kid.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.812
All this, this place,

30:15.509 --> 30:18.033
Jasper pays for all this,

30:18.120 --> 30:20.688
not you, definitely not me.

30:22.168 --> 30:25.475
Without him, what the
hell do I have, huh?

30:34.876 --> 30:35.703
- Okay.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.317
- Wait, what are you,
that's Jasper's shirt.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.754
What the fuck are you doing?

30:46.627 --> 30:48.542
- I'm getting your rings back.

30:48.629 --> 30:50.326
I'm gonna save the fucking day.

30:50.413 --> 30:52.154
I'm gonna get your
fucking rings back.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.808
I'm gonna get your rings
fucking back, baby.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.201
-  Where are you going?

30:55.288 --> 30:57.812
-  I'm getting
your rings back!

30:59.379 --> 31:00.902
- What are you doing,
what are you looking for?

31:00.989 --> 31:02.556
- We've gotta
clean this place up

31:03.557 --> 31:05.037
and everyone fucking wins.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.125
You know what, everyone's
gonna fucking win

31:06.212 --> 31:07.778
when we clean this place up,

31:07.866 --> 31:08.845
you know, even though
that you fucking feel like

31:08.845 --> 31:09.650
you got nothing without Jasper,

31:09.737 --> 31:11.347
you got fucking nothing.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.696
Without Jasper, what could
you possibly have, huh?

31:12.783 --> 31:14.046
- Baby, I didn't
mean it like that.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.786
I'm just a little
confused right now.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.092
- There's a lot of
fucking confusion in
the world right now,

31:17.179 --> 31:18.137
in our world, but,
you know what,

31:18.224 --> 31:19.464
I'm telling you, one day,

31:19.464 --> 31:20.704
and I swear to you
with all my heart,

31:20.791 --> 31:22.097
I can do it, I can
be a good father,

31:22.184 --> 31:23.751
and I'm gonna do
that, but right now,

31:23.838 --> 31:25.666
all I can do is get
your fucking rings back.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.537
You know why I'm gonna get
your fucking rings back?

31:27.624 --> 31:31.193
Because I love you and that
keeps you safe from Jasper.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.934
Let's save the fucking day.

31:33.021 --> 31:36.068
- Do you want me to go with
you wherever you're going?

31:36.155 --> 31:38.331
- No, no, no, you
need to stay here.

31:38.418 --> 31:40.899
You need to be safe. That's
what you're going to do.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.813
You're going to stay
here and be safe.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.293
- What about him?

31:46.165 --> 31:47.470
- I'm gonna take care of that,
I'm gonna take care of that.

31:47.557 --> 31:48.863
I'm gonna take care
of that, I promise.

31:48.950 --> 31:49.995
I'm gonna take care of
it but I can only do

31:50.082 --> 31:51.083
one thing at a time right now.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.214
I'm gonna go deal with this,

31:52.301 --> 31:53.694
I'm gonna deal with that later,

31:53.781 --> 31:55.174
but I promise you,
I'm gonna clean it up,

31:55.261 --> 31:56.088
I'm gonna get rid of this
guy, I'll fucking .

31:56.175 --> 31:57.567
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.008
I'm here, it's okay.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.010
-  You gotta promise me.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.489
- Anything.

32:06.576 --> 32:07.926
- That if I do this,
if I go get your rings,

32:09.188 --> 32:12.321
and, you know, I get
my shit together.

32:12.408 --> 32:13.496
-  And get off the drugs.

32:13.583 --> 32:16.021
- And I get off the drugs,

32:16.108 --> 32:17.936
that you'll be done with Jasper,

32:19.154 --> 32:21.026
like for good, okay?

32:21.113 --> 32:23.680
Like forever, and it'll
just be me and you.

32:23.767 --> 32:26.553
You know, like what we
always talked about.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.034
Like what we always
wanted, okay?

32:29.121 --> 32:30.861
Will you promise me, please?

32:38.130 --> 32:39.522
What, what, what?

34:32.070 --> 34:33.810
- Oh my God, oh my God.

34:40.774 --> 34:43.820
You can do this,
you can handle this.

34:43.907 --> 34:44.952
This is just a test.

34:49.391 --> 34:50.784
Sure, fuck, why not, fuck it!

34:50.871 --> 34:51.654
Test for what?

34:52.568 --> 34:54.004
For motherhood, perhaps.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.571
-  911,
what's your emergency?

34:55.658 --> 34:56.920
-  Yeah, yeah, hi,

34:57.007 --> 34:59.271
I would like to
report an emergency.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.534
- You're a strong,
girl, you can do this.

35:01.621 --> 35:03.013
Do not cry.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.493
Oh, you want to fucking
cry, but you can't.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.104
You cannot cry, Nikki.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.801
You fucking promised!

35:07.888 --> 35:10.151
-  It is on
fire, it's an inferno,

35:10.238 --> 35:11.413
there's a fucking inferno!

35:11.500 --> 35:12.501
Yeah, you gotta get here now,

35:12.588 --> 35:14.068
you gotta get here right now.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.461
You gotta get here right now!
- Calm down, sir.

35:15.548 --> 35:16.201
- Okay.
- Can I get your name, please?

35:16.288 --> 35:17.550
-  Uh.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.247
-  Sir?

35:19.334 --> 35:20.205
- People break promises
all the time, but not you,

35:20.292 --> 35:22.120
not you, not you.

35:22.207 --> 35:25.079
You're a strong girl, Nikki,
you can fucking do this.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.820
You can do anything.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.347
It's only a test.

35:38.788 --> 35:39.615
Let's go.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.677
- Oh fuck, holy fuck!

35:57.764 --> 35:58.591
Holy fuck!

35:59.592 --> 36:00.332
Oh my God.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.642
because she happened to put
the roll of toilet paper

37:33.729 --> 37:34.861
on the wrong way, is that right?

37:34.948 --> 37:35.949
You're very stupid.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.433
- She fucked my cousin, okay?

37:43.348 --> 37:44.653
- Like once removed, right,

37:44.740 --> 37:47.134
like a cousin of a
cousin kind of thing?

37:47.221 --> 37:48.353
Whoa.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.354

37:49.441 --> 37:50.833

37:50.920 --> 37:52.879

37:52.966 --> 37:54.533
- What's with the mask?
- Sir, we can't here you.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.230
You can take the mask off?

37:56.317 --> 37:57.362
-  My identity.

37:59.581 --> 38:01.235
- Are you on drugs, sir?

38:01.322 --> 38:02.454
I think he's on drugs.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.239
Sir, sir, what is your name?

38:08.155 --> 38:10.462
-  A lot, it's a lot.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.507
- All right.
- It's a lot to handle.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.204
It's a lot to handle.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.294
All right, this sucks. I
have to do it, I'm sorry.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.165
- Just take the mask off and
we'll talk about this, okay?

38:18.252 --> 38:19.471
- Sorry you gotta do what?

38:19.558 --> 38:20.515
- I'm sorry.
- You gotta do what?

38:20.602 --> 38:21.647
-  I'm sorry.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.126
- Whoa!

38:23.213 --> 38:24.824
-  Stick 'em
up, just stick 'em up.

38:24.911 --> 38:26.652
- All right, all right.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.915
All right, I'm gonna
tie you guys up.

38:29.002 --> 38:30.177
- We get it.

38:30.264 --> 38:32.571
-  Now where's the rope?

38:32.658 --> 38:36.314
- You look different
today, you look better.

38:39.186 --> 38:42.232
-  Okay, Marcus, Marcus.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.452
What was his last name,
I don't know, fuck it.

38:44.539 --> 38:45.366
Oh, shit.

38:48.151 --> 38:49.414
So much pressure.

38:56.203 --> 38:57.117
Yeah, yeah!

38:58.379 --> 38:59.337
Okay.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.215
Okay.

39:09.390 --> 39:14.352
Got it.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.071
- Mister,

39:40.334 --> 39:42.902
um, hi.

39:45.078 --> 39:46.732
I just want you to know,

39:48.560 --> 39:50.257
this is something I
would never wish upon you

39:50.344 --> 39:52.433
under any normal
circumstances, okay?

39:54.914 --> 39:56.394
I know it's really,
really fucked up,

39:56.481 --> 39:58.744
and I'm really, really
sorry I have to do this.

40:40.699 --> 40:41.874
- I did it.

40:41.961 --> 40:44.659
She's worth it, you got this.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.182
You got this.

40:46.269 --> 40:49.142
You just gotta go in
there and save the day

40:52.319 --> 40:53.451
and get her rings back.

40:55.061 --> 40:55.844
You got this.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.543
You got this.

40:58.630 --> 40:59.674
You got this.

41:00.675 --> 41:01.633
You got this.

41:25.918 --> 41:26.832
- Baby?

41:26.919 --> 41:28.529
-  Baby?

41:28.616 --> 41:29.965
It's been a long time since
I heard you call me that.

41:30.052 --> 41:31.619
- Jasper!

41:31.706 --> 41:33.447
What's going on, I thought
you had a gig tonight.

41:33.534 --> 41:34.840
What's happening?

41:34.927 --> 41:36.494
-  Well, they
canceled the gig.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.757
Some bullshit about us
not being able to perform,

41:38.844 --> 41:41.194
not in the right mindset.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.457
But with the bad comes
the good, sugarplum.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.938
It's starting to look like
Daddy's gonna be home early.

41:46.025 --> 41:47.853
In fact, we're at
the airport now.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.332
- You're at LAX?

41:49.419 --> 41:51.117
-  No, what's
the matter with you?

41:51.204 --> 41:53.162
I wouldn't call from
down the fucking street.

41:53.249 --> 41:54.860
Still in San Fran,
few hours out.

41:54.947 --> 41:56.688
- Great, awesome, okay.

41:57.950 --> 41:59.778
I can't wait to see you.

41:59.865 --> 42:02.476
-  Look, do
me a favor, would you?

42:02.563 --> 42:04.609
Go grab us some burgers
for when I get home,

42:04.696 --> 42:06.045
you know, from that little place

42:06.132 --> 42:08.482
with the little blue
flags, you know it?

42:08.569 --> 42:10.092
- Berserks?

42:10.179 --> 42:12.355
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Berserks, that's it, yeah.

42:12.442 --> 42:14.009
Get some of those.

42:14.096 --> 42:15.097
I'm fucking starving.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

42:15.184 --> 42:16.142
I can do that.

42:16.229 --> 42:17.491
-  Yeah, good girl.

42:17.578 --> 42:19.058
I'll see you soon.

42:21.713 --> 42:23.715
-  Baby, baby, baby,
hey, hey, I missed you,

42:23.802 --> 42:26.979
but my plan worked, I'm here,
can you believe that shit?

42:27.066 --> 42:28.937
I'm fucking here, I'm
fucking here, babe.

42:29.024 --> 42:30.504
My plan fucking

42:30.591 --> 42:31.418
- Fuck!

42:42.124 --> 42:44.039
- All right, just play it
cool, just play it cool.

42:44.126 --> 42:46.564
Just be cool,
Kyle, just be cool,

42:46.651 --> 42:48.087
and you got this.

42:49.262 --> 42:51.177
Even though this
is fucking stupid,

42:51.264 --> 42:52.744
so fucking stupid.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.529
Fuck it.

42:57.096 --> 42:58.532
Now just be confident,
just be confident,

42:58.619 --> 43:00.186
just be confident, and
you fucking got this.

43:00.273 --> 43:01.100
- Yeah!

43:03.319 --> 43:04.190
Oh.

43:05.278 --> 43:07.802
Thought you were my friend.

43:07.889 --> 43:09.674
- Nope, no, I'm not your
friend, I'm not your friend.

43:09.761 --> 43:10.762
Is your dad here?

43:10.849 --> 43:11.937
- No, he's at work.

43:13.852 --> 43:15.201
- What about your
mom, is she here?

43:15.288 --> 43:18.334
- Liz, somebody's at the door!

43:23.426 --> 43:24.819
- Can I help you?

43:25.864 --> 43:27.866
- Hi, hi, Mrs.
Steadman, how you doing?

43:27.953 --> 43:29.389
I hope you're
having a good night.

43:29.476 --> 43:30.999
I don't mean to bother
you so late, I mean,

43:31.826 --> 43:32.697
fuck me!

43:32.784 --> 43:33.611
- Excuse me?

43:35.047 --> 43:36.439
- I had this great
mask I was gonna wear

43:36.526 --> 43:37.789
to conceal my identity
and all that shit,

43:37.876 --> 43:38.833
but wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

43:38.920 --> 43:39.747
Ow, fuck!

43:39.834 --> 43:41.575
Lady, open the door.

43:41.662 --> 43:43.055
Open, in.

43:43.142 --> 43:44.709
Get back, get back, back up,

43:44.796 --> 43:47.320
don't even go for it,
kid, don't even go.

43:47.407 --> 43:49.627
You calm down, don't,
don't, I'm not here

43:49.714 --> 43:51.716
for anything except
your dad, okay?

43:51.803 --> 43:53.108
There's something I need
to talk to him about,

43:53.195 --> 43:54.719
so as long as you
guys play it cool,

43:54.806 --> 43:56.155
everything will be
dandy, all right,

43:56.242 --> 43:57.635
so be cool, all right?
- He's not here.

43:57.722 --> 43:59.332
I swear to God, he's not here.
- Sit down.

43:59.419 --> 44:00.246
Sit down!

44:00.333 --> 44:01.160
Tell her to be cool.

44:01.247 --> 44:02.552
- I'm cool, I'm fine.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.728
- Liz, relax, he's
not gonna do shit.

44:03.815 --> 44:05.207
- I will definitely do shit.

44:05.294 --> 44:07.557
I don't want to do shit,
but I will do shit.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.082
All right, bright
boy, you got that?

44:10.169 --> 44:11.300
- Bright boy?

44:11.387 --> 44:12.737
Who says bright boy?

44:12.824 --> 44:15.609
- Who calls their mother
by her first name?

44:15.696 --> 44:18.612
- She's my step-mother, dickwad.

44:18.699 --> 44:20.701
- Zach, stop.

44:20.788 --> 44:22.660
- Yeah, Zach, why
don't you .

44:24.487 --> 44:27.708
Why is your fucking TV on
so loud so late at night?

44:27.795 --> 44:29.275
You guys are fucking freaks.

44:29.362 --> 44:31.756
Listen, listen, sit down, sit.

44:31.843 --> 44:33.583
Sit down, and don't
even try to pull

44:33.671 --> 44:35.977
some fucking hero shit and
go for that fucking phone

44:36.064 --> 44:37.326
or I'll blow your
face off, okay?

44:37.413 --> 44:38.153
- Got it.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.285
Face shot off.

44:41.026 --> 44:45.813
- Oh God, oh, man,
I'm fucking up!

44:46.988 --> 44:48.424
I'm fucking up.

44:48.511 --> 44:49.687
I'm fucking up.

44:52.559 --> 44:54.082
Fuck.

44:54.169 --> 44:54.953
Watch it.

45:08.749 --> 45:11.796
All right.

45:11.883 --> 45:12.710
All right.

45:13.885 --> 45:14.886
It's no big deal.

45:15.756 --> 45:17.366
It's no big deal.

45:17.453 --> 45:18.585
It's no big deal.

45:22.981 --> 45:25.157
All right, all right,
no, get up, get up.

45:25.244 --> 45:27.812
Get up, change of plans, get up.

45:27.899 --> 45:29.465
You're gonna give me
a tour of the house

45:29.552 --> 45:31.511
and show me that your old
man really isn't here.

45:31.598 --> 45:32.860
- He's not here, dude.

45:32.947 --> 45:35.384
- Why exactly do
you want him for?

45:35.471 --> 45:36.690
- Just give me the tour.

45:38.257 --> 45:39.867
- This is the kitchen.

45:42.609 --> 45:44.524
We remodeled it
not too long ago,

45:44.611 --> 45:46.221
put in new countertops.

45:46.308 --> 45:48.397
I wanted an island, but
that didn't quite make it,

45:48.484 --> 45:49.311
but it is what it is, so.

45:52.053 --> 45:52.837
What?

45:52.924 --> 45:54.273
- An island?

45:54.360 --> 45:55.840
In here?

45:55.927 --> 45:56.666
- Yeah.

45:56.754 --> 45:57.580
- No.

45:59.321 --> 46:01.541
It might make it a little
crowded, right, an island?

46:01.628 --> 46:02.716
Not to say it's small.

46:04.196 --> 46:06.285
I mean, you could always
fix up a few things,

46:06.372 --> 46:07.895
but maybe an island, I
don't know about that,

46:07.982 --> 46:09.636
but maybe do the cupboards.

46:10.811 --> 46:11.856
I don't know--
- Wow, no old man

46:11.943 --> 46:13.727
in the kitchen, weird, huh?

46:13.814 --> 46:15.555
- What are you doing?

46:15.642 --> 46:17.122
- I'm making toast,
would you like some?

46:17.209 --> 46:18.558
- No, thank you.

46:18.645 --> 46:20.299
You gonna stay right there?

46:20.386 --> 46:21.866
- Til my toast is done, sure.

46:21.953 --> 46:23.389
- You ready?

46:23.476 --> 46:24.477
- Me?
- Yeah.

46:26.566 --> 46:28.046
Let's go, let's keep it moving.

46:28.133 --> 46:29.395
Wait, Miss Steadman, let me go.

46:29.482 --> 46:30.744
Stop.

46:30.831 --> 46:31.789
I'm going first.

46:33.616 --> 46:34.269
You were gonna signal him, is
that what you were gonna do?

46:34.356 --> 46:35.357
-  What?

46:35.444 --> 46:36.141
- You were gonna signal him.

46:38.665 --> 46:39.927
- It's the guest bedroom.

46:40.014 --> 46:41.233
We really don't
use it very much.

46:41.320 --> 46:42.147
- Is he in there?

46:42.974 --> 46:43.757
- What?

46:43.844 --> 46:44.671
- Open it.

46:45.846 --> 46:47.021
I'm not getting booby-trapped.

46:47.108 --> 46:47.892
Is that what you're
trying to do?

46:47.979 --> 46:48.893
Open it, I'm not.

46:48.980 --> 46:49.981
Go.

47:03.385 --> 47:04.778
He's not in there.

47:04.865 --> 47:05.692
- No?
- No.

47:09.087 --> 47:09.957
Hey.

47:11.350 --> 47:12.699
- Oh, no, no, no,
I can't open that.

47:12.786 --> 47:13.743
That's his bedroom.

47:15.963 --> 47:17.660
I can't.

47:17.747 --> 47:18.705
- I don't care if it's the
arc of the fucking covenant,

47:18.792 --> 47:19.749
lady, just open the door.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.142
It's an easy thing to do.

47:21.229 --> 47:21.839
- We have had many
issues in the past,

47:21.926 --> 47:23.362
and I will not open it.

47:23.449 --> 47:25.190
If Zach wants to open
it for you, feel free.

47:25.277 --> 47:26.408
I'm not gonna do it.

47:26.495 --> 47:28.149
- Open the door.
- All right.

47:28.236 --> 47:28.889
-  Open the door, open
the door, open the door.

47:28.976 --> 47:29.803
Jesus Christ.

47:29.890 --> 47:31.413
Is he in here?

47:31.500 --> 47:32.284
Is he in the closet?
- He's not in the closet.

47:32.371 --> 47:33.633
- All right.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.505
What, you're like
into film and shit?

47:36.592 --> 47:38.856
- If by "and shit,"
you mean music,

47:38.943 --> 47:40.509
then, yeah, I'm
into film and shit.

47:40.596 --> 47:41.554
- Okay, I really
wish the two of you

47:41.641 --> 47:42.685
would stop cursing so much.

47:42.772 --> 47:43.773
It's absolutely not necessary.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.427
- I think that's really cool.

47:45.514 --> 47:47.038
You know, I'm a big film
and music guy myself.

47:47.125 --> 47:48.126
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

47:48.213 --> 47:48.996
- Cool, I bet I got you beat.

47:51.564 --> 47:53.261
- You think you got me beat?
- Probably.

47:54.828 --> 47:56.525
- All right, hot shot,
who's your favorite band

47:56.612 --> 47:57.483
or musician?

47:57.570 --> 47:58.571
- Iggy and the Stooges.

48:04.620 --> 48:05.447
- Mm.

48:07.275 --> 48:08.755
What's your favorite Iggy jam?

48:08.842 --> 48:10.975
- Anything from '72 to '74.

48:11.062 --> 48:11.889
- Whoa!

48:20.071 --> 48:22.377
Lady, your son has
got impeccable taste.

48:22.464 --> 48:23.291
- Step-son.

48:23.378 --> 48:24.771
- Fucking impeccable.

48:24.858 --> 48:25.859
Doesn't matter, well
played, well played.

48:27.861 --> 48:28.644
- Next room?

48:28.731 --> 48:30.168
- Yeah, next room.

48:32.126 --> 48:33.084
Want me to shut this?

48:33.171 --> 48:33.998
-  Please.

48:35.129 --> 48:36.826
-  Silence, please.

48:36.914 --> 48:39.177
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your host Mr. Owens here.

48:39.264 --> 48:40.743
- This is a good fucking movie.

48:40.830 --> 48:42.789
Yeah, it's not his best
work, I don't think,

48:42.876 --> 48:44.965
but, you know, the
courtroom scene in this,

48:46.488 --> 48:49.013
the guys looking like
chess pieces, I love that.

48:49.100 --> 48:50.405
- Yeah, that sequence
is real good,

48:50.492 --> 48:52.059
but those dolly shots
in the trenches,

48:52.146 --> 48:53.626
that's what really
stands out about this.

48:53.713 --> 48:55.019
That shit's the fucking best.

48:55.106 --> 48:56.368
- Okay, the two of
you, your language.

48:56.455 --> 48:57.891
I'm just tired of it.

48:57.978 --> 48:58.805
Please.

49:00.459 --> 49:03.288
-  Prisoners
of the bar of justice,

49:03.375 --> 49:05.159
Dr. Edward G .

49:07.292 --> 49:08.597
- Fuck, is that him?

49:08.684 --> 49:09.729
Is that Marcus, is
that your husband,

49:09.816 --> 49:11.209
is that your dad, is that him?

49:11.296 --> 49:12.906
- Why would Marcus
knock at his own door?

49:12.993 --> 49:14.952
- I told you already, man.

49:15.039 --> 49:16.431
- Told me, what'd you tell me?

49:16.518 --> 49:18.172
- I told you, I thought
you were my friend.

49:18.259 --> 49:19.913
He was supposed to be coming
over when you showed up.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.349
- So why didn't you just
tell him not to come tonight?

49:21.436 --> 49:23.047
- When would I have done
that? You wanted the tour.

49:23.134 --> 49:25.223
Plus, you said no hero shit
like touching the phone.

49:26.441 --> 49:27.486
- You're right, I did say that.

49:30.010 --> 49:31.403
I'm gonna take care of this.

49:31.490 --> 49:32.970
All right, what's his name?

49:34.145 --> 49:34.928
- Eat Dog.

49:36.495 --> 49:37.452
- I thought you were
done with the attitude.

49:37.539 --> 49:39.193
- Relax, that is his name!

49:39.280 --> 49:40.238
His name is Eat Dog, that's
what we call him, I swear!

49:40.325 --> 49:41.500
- That's what his name is.

49:41.587 --> 49:43.284
That's what they call
him, I have no idea why.

49:43.371 --> 49:44.633
- You need new friends.

49:44.720 --> 49:46.461
He sounds like a bad guy.

49:46.548 --> 49:48.246
You are the company you keep.

49:48.333 --> 49:50.378
Stay right there.

49:52.163 --> 49:53.120
Stay right there.

49:57.777 --> 49:59.213
- Oh!
- Whoa.

49:59.300 --> 50:00.519
- The fuck are you doing?
-  Nikki?

50:01.389 --> 50:02.695
- What are you doing?

50:02.782 --> 50:03.870
-  I thought
you were Eat Dog.

50:03.957 --> 50:05.002
- Who?

50:05.089 --> 50:06.394
- Come inside here, come inside.

50:06.481 --> 50:07.265
Eat Dog, I thought
you were Eat Dog.

50:07.352 --> 50:08.918
- Okay, all right.

50:09.006 --> 50:09.702
-  Watch out, here,
chill out, chill out.

50:09.789 --> 50:11.399
How'd you know I was here?

50:11.486 --> 50:12.792
- Uh, you left a voicemail
with the address on it?

50:12.879 --> 50:13.793
I called you back
40 fucking times.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.229
- What?

50:15.316 --> 50:16.448
- You're fucking high
again, aren't you?

50:16.535 --> 50:17.840
- I knew it.

50:17.927 --> 50:18.667
- Unbelievable, unbelievable.

50:18.754 --> 50:20.104
- I'm not high.

50:20.191 --> 50:23.324
Hey, baby, come on,
it's not like that.

50:23.411 --> 50:25.152
Hey, hey, it's not like that.

50:25.239 --> 50:27.720
I took one bump, just to
get myself straightened out

50:27.807 --> 50:30.505
so I could, like, handle
this whole undertaking.

50:30.592 --> 50:31.854
That's why I did it, baby.

50:31.941 --> 50:33.204
Look at me, babe,
you look pretty.

50:33.291 --> 50:34.509
You look really
beautiful right now,

50:34.596 --> 50:36.076
you're cleaned up.

50:37.208 --> 50:37.991
I mean, think about the
last time I saw you.

50:38.078 --> 50:38.731
You look gorgeous.

50:38.818 --> 50:39.514
- Oh, really?

50:39.601 --> 50:40.820
I look pretty?

50:40.907 --> 50:41.690
- Yeah.

50:41.777 --> 50:42.952
You look beautiful.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.389
You look so--

50:44.476 --> 50:45.738
- Look at you, you
look like a cokehead

50:45.825 --> 50:47.479
with these stupid
fucking glasses on.

50:47.566 --> 50:49.785
I'm so done, I'm so
done, and I'm so over it,

50:49.872 --> 50:51.135
and you wanna know why?

50:51.222 --> 50:53.920
Because Jasper is
on his way home.

50:54.007 --> 50:55.661
- Jasper's on his way home?
- Who's Jasper?

50:55.748 --> 50:57.054
- None of your business!

50:57.141 --> 50:58.316
- Wait. Oh, oh!
- None of your business.

50:58.403 --> 50:59.926
- You're Marcus'
kid, aren't you?

51:00.013 --> 51:01.449
- Uh, Marcus' kid, yeah.

51:01.536 --> 51:02.929
Hers, no way.

51:03.016 --> 51:04.148
- So you're Lizzy, then.

51:05.627 --> 51:07.542
- He did try to rob from
you guys, didn't he?

51:07.629 --> 51:09.327
- Oh yeah, you're
fucking asshole husband

51:09.414 --> 51:11.677
tried to steal 10 grand from us.

51:11.764 --> 51:13.679
- I can't believe he would
do that. I don't believe it.

51:13.766 --> 51:15.420
- Well, believe it cause he did

51:15.507 --> 51:16.377
try to steal from us.

51:16.464 --> 51:18.075
He also stole her rings.

51:18.162 --> 51:19.554
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:19.641 --> 51:21.121
- Yeah, well, but when
you think about it,

51:21.208 --> 51:22.514
it's actually kind of sweet

51:22.601 --> 51:23.819
cause he was just
doing it for you, so.

51:26.257 --> 51:27.432
Can I see the bathroom?

51:29.434 --> 51:30.217
- Yeah, sure.

51:30.304 --> 51:31.218
- Don't move, no!

51:31.305 --> 51:32.698
Bad idea!

51:32.785 --> 51:34.526
You're staying right
there, stay right there,

51:34.613 --> 51:35.570
everyone's staying right here,
everyone's gonna sit here,

51:35.657 --> 51:36.832
we're all gonna sit here,

51:36.919 --> 51:38.182
and we're gonna watch
this wonderful movie

51:38.269 --> 51:40.009
until your dipshit husband walks

51:40.097 --> 51:41.359
through the
wonderful door, okay?

51:41.446 --> 51:42.577
That's what we're
gonna do, right?

51:42.664 --> 51:43.404
Hey, Zach.

51:43.491 --> 51:44.536
- Hi.
- Hi!

51:44.623 --> 51:45.754
You're gonna stay right there.

51:45.841 --> 51:47.365
- Sure!
- Got it, easy, be cool.

51:47.452 --> 51:48.801
- That's a terrible fucking plan

51:48.888 --> 51:50.368
because we don't have
that kind of time.

51:50.455 --> 51:52.109
Jasper's gonna be here
in an hour and a half.

51:52.196 --> 51:54.154
- In an hour and a half?
- Yes, he's in San Francisco.

51:54.241 --> 51:56.809
Yeah, your genius
plan has been foiled.

51:56.896 --> 51:57.679
Great.

52:06.297 --> 52:09.952
- Here, we're going
to use this right now.

52:10.039 --> 52:13.434
- Just pass it to
me like a human.

52:13.521 --> 52:14.348
- Call.

52:15.915 --> 52:17.656
You're gonna call
Eat Dog right now

52:17.743 --> 52:19.353
and you're gonna tell him
that he's not coming over

52:19.440 --> 52:21.094
cause I don't want to shoot
his face off, too, okay?

52:21.181 --> 52:22.661
- Why do you have to
shoot our faces off?

52:22.748 --> 52:24.271
I don't understand.

52:24.358 --> 52:25.359
- He's probably just
gonna get high and forget

52:25.446 --> 52:27.187
he even has a gun, honestly.

52:27.274 --> 52:30.059
- Hey, hey, hey, what happened
to being on the same team?

52:30.147 --> 52:31.452
- The team went out
the fucking window

52:31.539 --> 52:33.411
when you did all
that coke, remember?

52:35.195 --> 52:36.240
- All right.

52:36.327 --> 52:38.894
Hey, speaker, I wanna hear this.

52:38.981 --> 52:40.287
- Oh, my God.

52:40.374 --> 52:41.593
-  I wanna hear it.

52:41.680 --> 52:43.595
-  Dude, I'm on my way!

52:43.682 --> 52:45.379
- Hey, man, I can't
do it tonight.

52:45.466 --> 52:46.989
-  What are
you talking about?

52:47.076 --> 52:48.034
- I don't feel great.

52:48.121 --> 52:49.383
-  You sound fine.

52:49.470 --> 52:50.863
-  I got food
poisoning, all right?

52:50.950 --> 52:52.908
I puked all over the
couch and everything.

52:52.995 --> 52:55.259
-  Well, man, Dizzy
Lizzy must be pissed, huh?

52:55.346 --> 52:57.261
That is, if she took your
dad's dick out of her mouth.

52:57.348 --> 52:58.566
- Tomorrow, okay, bye!

52:59.741 --> 53:00.786
- See what I have
to put up with?

53:00.873 --> 53:01.743
- I didn't say it.

53:01.830 --> 53:03.180
- Hey, hey, your turn.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.572
Your turn, your turn,
pick up the phone.

53:04.659 --> 53:06.270
- Me?
-  Yeah, it's your turn.

53:06.357 --> 53:07.227
- Why?

53:07.314 --> 53:08.707
- Now you're gonna call,

53:08.794 --> 53:10.317
here, pick up the phone,
pick up the phone.

53:10.404 --> 53:12.624
Here, put it in your hand.

53:12.711 --> 53:15.235
Take the phone, and
now you're gonna call

53:16.758 --> 53:19.152
your husband and you're
gonna tell him to come home

53:19.239 --> 53:20.893
because there's an
emergency or something,

53:20.980 --> 53:23.809
and you're gonna tell him
to bring her rings, okay?

53:23.896 --> 53:25.550
- I'm not gonna
call him back here

53:25.637 --> 53:26.899
so that you can just hurt
him. I'm not gonna do it.

53:26.986 --> 53:28.553
You're crazy.
- Why would we hurt him?

53:28.640 --> 53:29.641
I'm not gonna hurt him.

53:29.728 --> 53:30.555
He's not gonna get hurt.

53:30.642 --> 53:32.818
- Oh, I did hurt him.

53:32.905 --> 53:34.907
Yeah, I shot his fingers off.

53:34.994 --> 53:36.735
- What?
- Just blew 'em right off.

53:36.822 --> 53:39.694
I don't even know where they
went now that I think about it.

53:39.781 --> 53:41.087
- This is so fucking fucked.

53:41.174 --> 53:42.654
- Your language is
atrocious tonight,

53:42.741 --> 53:44.046
shut up!
- I don't care!

53:44.133 --> 53:47.136
- Lady, motherfucker,
pick up the phone

53:47.224 --> 53:48.616
and call him or I'm gonna shoot

53:48.703 --> 53:50.227
your precious little
son in the leg.

53:50.314 --> 53:51.315
- Step-son!

53:51.402 --> 53:53.273
Fucking, I'm her step-son!

53:53.360 --> 53:55.362
- Step-son, step-son.

53:55.449 --> 53:56.798
One more word.

53:57.712 --> 53:58.452
One more word.

53:58.539 --> 53:59.801
One more word

53:59.888 --> 54:01.325
that doesn't have
something to do

54:01.412 --> 54:02.761
with a kick-ass film or
Iggy and the Stooges,

54:02.848 --> 54:05.416
I'm gonna seriously
consider using this

54:05.503 --> 54:07.983
to put a bullet in
your 16-year-old leg.

54:08.984 --> 54:10.377
Right?

54:10.464 --> 54:11.422
- Okay, look, look,
look, I'm calling him.

54:11.509 --> 54:13.162
It's ringing.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.034
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, we
don't have to shoot anyone.

54:15.121 --> 54:16.949
Okay, Marcus is coming.

54:17.036 --> 54:18.342
Just calm, deep breaths, okay?
- I'm not gonna shoot anybody,

54:18.429 --> 54:19.430
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

54:19.517 --> 54:20.866
I like kids.

54:20.953 --> 54:22.259
But not this kid.

54:22.346 --> 54:25.349
Not this 16-year-old
fucking fuck kid.

54:25.436 --> 54:26.524
I can kill this kid.

54:26.611 --> 54:28.700
I can kill this kid's leg.

54:28.787 --> 54:30.745
I could shoot this kid.

54:31.790 --> 54:32.617
- 17.

54:34.793 --> 54:35.620
- What?

54:37.317 --> 54:39.232
- You said you were gonna
end my 16-year-old leg,

54:39.319 --> 54:40.755
and I'm 17.

54:40.842 --> 54:43.062
- You know what, that
is it, game over, Zach!

54:52.332 --> 54:54.987
- Oh my God, oh
my God, oh my God!

54:55.814 --> 54:57.294
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

54:57.381 --> 54:59.121
- Get it out, please!

54:59.208 --> 55:00.384
- You stabbed your own mom!

55:00.471 --> 55:01.341
- Marcus.

55:02.821 --> 55:04.388
- Fuck, come in, come in.

55:04.475 --> 55:06.346
- What are you doing here?

55:06.433 --> 55:07.782
- Sit down!

55:07.869 --> 55:09.480
- Relax, Dad, he doesn't
have any bullets.

55:10.698 --> 55:11.960
- What?

55:12.047 --> 55:13.310
- You pointed the
gun at my face.

55:13.397 --> 55:15.442
I saw all the chambers,
you dumb fuck!

55:15.529 --> 55:18.010
- You pointed a gun
at my son's face?

55:18.097 --> 55:20.752
- What, I mean,
yeah, but not really.

55:20.839 --> 55:22.057
It doesn't have any

55:22.144 --> 55:23.276
bullets in it.
- Hey, can we get,

55:23.363 --> 55:24.016
can we take care
of this, please?

55:24.103 --> 55:25.060
Do you mind?

55:25.147 --> 55:26.410
- Sure, what's wrong, baby?

55:26.497 --> 55:28.760
- Zachary stabbed
me is what's wrong.

55:28.847 --> 55:30.501
- You stabbed Liz?

55:30.588 --> 55:32.416
- No, no, he didn't mean to.

55:32.503 --> 55:33.460
I'm sorry.

55:33.547 --> 55:34.853
- I was trying to get him.

55:34.940 --> 55:36.289
He moved out of the
way and I hit her.

55:36.376 --> 55:37.769
- Go to the bathroom
and get the gauze!

55:38.770 --> 55:40.946
- Sure, I'm fine, Dad, I'm fine,

55:41.033 --> 55:42.339
no worries.
- You gotta pull it out.

55:42.426 --> 55:43.775
- How did you find where I live?

55:43.862 --> 55:45.472
- The fire station.

55:45.559 --> 55:46.995
- They gave you my address?

55:47.082 --> 55:49.650
- No, I had a mask, I
should've wore the mask.

55:49.737 --> 55:50.695
I'm fucked.

55:50.782 --> 55:51.783
- That doesn't make any--

55:51.870 --> 55:53.480
- Oh, my God, the two of you,

55:53.567 --> 55:54.873
I have a letter opener
sticking out of my shoulder!

55:54.960 --> 55:55.743
Could you get it
out, please, Marcus?

55:55.830 --> 55:56.309
- Right, right, right, sorry.

55:56.396 --> 55:57.049
Zach!

56:00.879 --> 56:02.881
- Your wife's in the kitchen.

56:02.968 --> 56:04.230
- She's not my wife.

56:04.317 --> 56:05.971
- So then they're
not your rings.

56:06.058 --> 56:07.276
- What rings are
you talking about?

56:07.364 --> 56:08.800
- The rings you stole.

56:08.887 --> 56:10.454
- I didn't steal any rings.

56:10.541 --> 56:12.064
- What do you mean you
didn't steal any rings?

56:12.151 --> 56:13.500
- I mean, I didn't
steal any rings.

56:13.587 --> 56:14.936
What else would I mean?

56:16.590 --> 56:19.201
Look, you two, this is
getting out of hand.

56:19.288 --> 56:21.247
All right, we need
to make a deal here.

56:22.770 --> 56:24.816
I don't want your money anymore.

56:24.903 --> 56:26.165
- It's not his money anyway.

56:26.252 --> 56:27.471
-  Is it Jasper's money?

56:27.558 --> 56:29.560
- Zach, I told you to go to bed.

56:29.647 --> 56:32.084
- Yes, Jasper,
Jasper my husband,

56:32.171 --> 56:33.520
who's going to murder all of us

56:33.607 --> 56:35.087
when he gets home
because he's a sociopath

56:35.174 --> 56:36.175
with a drinking problem.

56:36.262 --> 56:37.698
- Well, that's just great.

56:37.785 --> 56:39.004
- Baby, he's not gonna
hurt you, I promise.

56:39.091 --> 56:40.658
That I can always
promise, all right?

56:40.745 --> 56:42.007
- Is this the Jasper I
think we're talking about?

56:42.094 --> 56:44.488
- Zach, I told you to go to bed.

56:44.575 --> 56:46.359
- I stabbed your wife
because you robbed

56:46.446 --> 56:47.839
a couple of drug addicts.

56:47.926 --> 56:49.536
I'm not going to be
able to sleep for years.

56:49.623 --> 56:51.016
- We're not drug addicts.
- Can we please not talk

56:51.103 --> 56:51.712
about stabbing anyone?
- You're definitely

56:51.712 --> 56:52.844
a drug addict.

56:52.931 --> 56:54.498
Oh yeah, Liz wanted
me to tell you

56:54.585 --> 56:56.021
that she's going to bed
and she wanted to emphasize

56:56.108 --> 56:58.327
the fact that she's
not very happy.

56:58.415 --> 56:59.285
- Thank you, Zach.

57:00.765 --> 57:02.244
Okay, guys, look.

57:02.331 --> 57:03.507
I just want this night
to be over, all right,

57:03.594 --> 57:05.596
and maybe get my fingers back,

57:05.683 --> 57:08.599
so, look, none of us
can go to the police,

57:08.686 --> 57:10.427
all right, we're all
in this together now.

57:10.514 --> 57:11.950
I'm willing to go to your house

57:12.037 --> 57:14.518
and help clean up before
psycho what's-his-fuck

57:14.605 --> 57:16.215
gets home, and
dispose of the body,

57:16.302 --> 57:19.044
if you can just get me my
fingers back, all right?

57:19.131 --> 57:20.437
- Just give me my rings back

57:20.524 --> 57:21.873
and we'll go look
for your fingers.

57:21.960 --> 57:23.352
- You don't know
where my fingers are?

57:23.440 --> 57:25.964
- Baby, he hasn't
got your rings.

57:26.051 --> 57:27.574
- Well, of course
he has my rings.

57:27.661 --> 57:29.446
- Nah, I mean, he doesn't,
someone else might.

57:29.533 --> 57:31.143
The other guy might,
that other guy,

57:31.230 --> 57:32.797
but he doesn't have your rings.

57:37.366 --> 57:38.150
- What?

57:39.281 --> 57:40.892
- He's in the car.

57:40.979 --> 57:42.284
- Who's in the car?

57:42.371 --> 57:43.808
- Sebastian.

57:43.895 --> 57:45.157
- Sebastian's dead.

57:45.244 --> 57:46.550
- Holy shit, your
new partner's dead?

57:46.637 --> 57:48.203
- He's out in the car?

57:48.290 --> 57:49.683
- Yes, yes, dead Sebstian's
in the car, all right?

57:49.770 --> 57:51.032
Fuck, I couldn't just
leave him in the house.

57:51.119 --> 57:52.164
He's in the fucking car.

57:52.251 --> 57:53.818
He was still fucking breathing.

57:53.905 --> 57:55.297
I had to tie a fucking
plastic bag over his head.

57:55.384 --> 57:56.342
- So I didn't kill him?

57:56.429 --> 57:57.909
So we killed him together?

57:57.996 --> 57:59.432
- I don't fucking know.
- Oh my God, it doesn't

57:59.519 --> 58:00.825
matter who killed him,
just where's the car?

58:06.526 --> 58:07.484
- Oh God.

58:09.007 --> 58:11.923
Oh my God, I wasn't
here that long.

58:13.185 --> 58:14.055
- No.

58:15.666 --> 58:16.797
- This is where you parked,

58:16.884 --> 58:18.451
this, this is where you parked?

58:18.538 --> 58:19.931
You got towed.

58:20.018 --> 58:21.236
- Please tell me that
you didn't just park

58:21.323 --> 58:22.934
in front of a
fucking fire hydrant

58:23.021 --> 58:25.980
with a dead body in your car.
- It was Jasper's car.

58:26.067 --> 58:27.025
-  It was Jasper's?

58:27.112 --> 58:28.940
- My Porsche's in the shop.

58:29.027 --> 58:30.376
- I fucking love you.

58:30.463 --> 58:32.204
You're like, you're
smart and you're hot.

58:32.291 --> 58:33.248
You're the best.

58:33.335 --> 58:34.815
- Oh my god, fucking stop!

58:34.902 --> 58:36.861
- You need to chill the
fuck out, you know that?

58:36.948 --> 58:37.731
Relax.

58:37.818 --> 58:38.819
- Relax?

58:38.906 --> 58:40.299
She's just got her car towed

58:40.386 --> 58:41.822
with my partner's dead
body in the trunk!

58:41.909 --> 58:43.389
- You're talking like
she doesn't know that.

58:43.476 --> 58:45.130
She knows that there's a dead
body in the fucking trunk.

58:45.217 --> 58:47.306
What the fuck is wrong
with you? Calm down.

58:47.393 --> 58:48.437
- What do you think
is going to happen

58:48.525 --> 58:49.917
when the towing company realizes

58:50.004 --> 58:51.136
they've painted a brand
new red carpool lane

58:51.223 --> 58:52.050
down the 405?

58:56.054 --> 58:57.011
- Maybe they won't notice.

58:57.098 --> 58:58.535
It's LA, I don't know.

58:58.622 --> 58:59.623
- We're all gonna spend
the rest of our lives

58:59.710 --> 59:00.972
in little tiny prison cells.

59:01.059 --> 59:02.495
- If you're so fucking smart,

59:02.582 --> 59:03.409
then what do you suggest
we do then, huh, what?

59:03.496 --> 59:04.541
-  Yeah.

59:04.628 --> 59:05.846
- Okay.

59:05.933 --> 59:07.413
We gotta go to the ambulance.

59:07.500 --> 59:08.849
- Ambulance, why would
we go to the ambulance?

59:08.936 --> 59:10.503
- Her car just got
towed to the impound,

59:10.590 --> 59:12.636
so we need to go to the
impound to get the car back.

59:12.723 --> 59:14.420
Assuming, by some
random act of God,

59:14.507 --> 59:16.553
they didn't discover the
dead body in the trunk,

59:16.640 --> 59:18.076
we still need to dispose of it,

59:18.163 --> 59:19.730
something that the ambulance,

59:19.817 --> 59:21.427
with all of its equipment
inside like, you know,

59:21.514 --> 59:22.950
the body bags and shit
might actually help us with.

59:23.037 --> 59:24.473
- I got it!

59:24.561 --> 59:26.954
It's a great idea, I'm
sorry I questioned you.

59:27.041 --> 59:28.521
- Yeah, yeah, it's a great idea,

59:28.608 --> 59:30.697
except Jasper's gonna be
here in a fucking hour.

59:32.264 --> 59:33.178
- Of course he is.

59:35.049 --> 59:36.703
- Where is he going?

59:42.274 --> 59:44.058
Okay.
- I'm getting claustrophobic.

59:46.191 --> 59:47.627
My legs are fucking sore.

59:47.714 --> 59:48.497
- Okay.

59:49.629 --> 59:50.935
- What are you doing?

59:51.022 --> 59:52.850
Safety precautions.

59:52.937 --> 59:54.329
Who knows how
somebody's gonna react

59:54.416 --> 59:56.331
when they find the dead
body in your trunk?

59:56.418 --> 59:58.029
- That's a good idea.

59:58.116 --> 59:59.508
How'd you get so much ammo?

59:59.596 --> 1:00:01.380
- .357s aren't that rare, kid.

1:00:01.467 --> 1:00:02.686
- Here let me do it, I can help.

1:00:02.773 --> 1:00:04.339
I got fingers, you only got--

1:00:04.426 --> 1:00:06.298
- No, no, no, no, oh,
you're gun-toting privileges

1:00:06.385 --> 1:00:07.691
have been revoked, fella.

1:00:07.778 --> 1:00:08.648
-  You only
got eight fingers.

1:00:09.649 --> 1:00:10.476
- No.

1:00:10.563 --> 1:00:12.739
-  All right.

1:00:12.826 --> 1:00:13.958
- Okay, now,

1:00:15.742 --> 1:00:18.223
Jasper Duke, that's the name
on the registration, right?

1:00:18.310 --> 1:00:20.007
- Yeah, yeah,
Jasper Douglas Duke.

1:00:20.094 --> 1:00:22.314
- Okay, and you do
actually have ID

1:00:22.401 --> 1:00:26.187
saying that you are,
in fact, his wife?

1:00:26.274 --> 1:00:29.103
- Yeah, yeah, I
got it right here.

1:00:30.670 --> 1:00:31.497
- Be careful.

1:00:32.759 --> 1:00:34.021
I'll just be here.

1:00:38.330 --> 1:00:39.287
- Now I'm sorry.

1:00:53.780 --> 1:00:54.563
- Oh!

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:56.087
- Ah, well, hello.

1:00:58.306 --> 1:00:59.699
- Hi.

1:00:59.786 --> 1:01:01.962
- What can I do for you
this lovely evening?

1:01:02.049 --> 1:01:03.790
- We're just here
to pick up my car.

1:01:03.877 --> 1:01:06.010
- Oh, pick up your ride, eh?

1:01:08.534 --> 1:01:10.101
I would like to take
a lot more than that

1:01:10.188 --> 1:01:11.755
off your hands, my friend.

1:01:12.843 --> 1:01:15.759
Nah, nah, nah,
come on.

1:01:16.847 --> 1:01:17.804
Give me your name.

1:01:17.891 --> 1:01:18.805
We'll give your ride back.

1:01:18.892 --> 1:01:20.328
- Uh, it's Duke.

1:01:20.415 --> 1:01:21.765
Jasper Duke.

1:01:22.766 --> 1:01:23.767
- One moment, please.

1:01:32.210 --> 1:01:33.951
Ah, the green Mustang, yes?

1:01:36.388 --> 1:01:37.432
- Uh, yeah.

1:01:39.217 --> 1:01:41.480
- I see.

1:01:41.567 --> 1:01:44.657
A cool car for a cool guy.

1:01:46.311 --> 1:01:48.139
Make sense how you can
get such a fine woman.

1:01:50.794 --> 1:01:52.665
Please, give me your ID.

1:01:52.752 --> 1:01:54.014
- Show him your ID, babe.

1:01:56.582 --> 1:01:57.888
- Okay.

1:01:57.975 --> 1:01:58.976
-  Please.

1:01:59.063 --> 1:02:00.673
- Sure, yeah, sure.

1:02:05.896 --> 1:02:07.898
- Okay, it's good, it's good.

1:02:07.985 --> 1:02:09.464
Okay.

1:02:09.551 --> 1:02:12.816
Follow me, we're going
to inspect the car,

1:02:12.903 --> 1:02:14.992
pay the fee, and
you'll be on your way.

1:02:15.079 --> 1:02:15.906
- Inspect it?

1:02:16.907 --> 1:02:17.734
What for?

1:02:18.909 --> 1:02:20.693
- Amigo, it's state law.

1:02:20.780 --> 1:02:23.174
We have to check all the
cars before we cut them.

1:02:23.261 --> 1:02:24.349
Come, come along.

1:02:24.436 --> 1:02:25.698
Follow me, this way.

1:02:25.785 --> 1:02:26.873
Come, come, come.

1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:27.918
- Okay.
- Excuse me, please.

1:02:28.005 --> 1:02:28.962
- Go ahead.

1:02:44.935 --> 1:02:47.024
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa,
whoa, what are you doing?

1:02:47.111 --> 1:02:48.939
Are you kidding me?
- What the fuck?

1:02:49.026 --> 1:02:50.331
-  Are you
kidding me, man?

1:02:50.418 --> 1:02:51.463
- Hey, give me that.
- After all that?

1:02:51.550 --> 1:02:52.594
After how pissed your girl got,

1:02:52.681 --> 1:02:53.726
after how hot your girl is,

1:02:53.813 --> 1:02:55.032
you're still gonna do this shit?

1:02:55.119 --> 1:02:56.424
- Give me that back.
- This is mine,

1:02:56.511 --> 1:02:57.295
mine, now.
- Fuck, you have a camera,

1:02:57.382 --> 1:02:58.775
what are you doing?

1:02:58.862 --> 1:03:00.298
- Getting rid of this
shit, and I'm filming

1:03:00.385 --> 1:03:01.908
because this is a pretty
memorable occurrence.

1:03:01.995 --> 1:03:03.170
It's for your own good.

1:03:04.345 --> 1:03:05.912
- How do you know
what my good is?

1:03:05.999 --> 1:03:08.001
This is my fucking good.

1:03:08.088 --> 1:03:10.090
-  Oh, well then I
dumped your good. I'm sorry.

1:03:10.177 --> 1:03:12.789
- You're a little
prick, you know that?

1:03:12.876 --> 1:03:14.616
Little fuck.

1:03:14.703 --> 1:03:16.314
- You mind if I ask you a few
questions to better document

1:03:16.401 --> 1:03:17.184
the evening?
- There's no sound

1:03:17.271 --> 1:03:18.969
on that camera.

1:03:19.056 --> 1:03:20.187
-  So is your girl
really married to Jasper Duke?

1:03:20.274 --> 1:03:21.972
Is that what I heard?

1:03:22.059 --> 1:03:24.844
- Wait, what, what, who, who
are you again, by the way?

1:03:24.931 --> 1:03:26.280
What are you doing here?

1:03:26.367 --> 1:03:27.629
You little boy.

1:03:27.716 --> 1:03:29.501
- You didn't answer my question.

1:03:29.588 --> 1:03:31.372
Is she married to him?

1:03:34.767 --> 1:03:35.594
- Yeah.

1:03:35.681 --> 1:03:36.900
Yeah.

1:03:36.987 --> 1:03:38.815
She's married to Jasper Duke.

1:03:38.902 --> 1:03:41.600
Well, you're gonna
say now that, aw, man,

1:03:41.687 --> 1:03:43.515
I love his music
so fucking much,

1:03:43.602 --> 1:03:46.561
I think it's the best
thing since sliced bread.

1:03:46.648 --> 1:03:47.519
Oh, it's the shit.

1:03:47.606 --> 1:03:48.912
Well, guess what, pal?

1:03:48.999 --> 1:03:50.261
I think it's great, too, okay,

1:03:50.348 --> 1:03:52.306
so you can save
your breath, okay?

1:03:52.393 --> 1:03:53.699
- Well, actually, I
think he's a hack,

1:03:53.786 --> 1:03:55.092
but I do know his shit.

1:03:58.878 --> 1:04:00.706
- Well, okay, he's
not a hack, okay?

1:04:01.750 --> 1:04:03.578
I mean, he's talented.

1:04:05.885 --> 1:04:07.931
- That why you're
porking his wife?

1:04:08.018 --> 1:04:08.845
- No.

1:04:10.455 --> 1:04:13.850
That is not why I'm porking
his wife, all right?

1:04:13.937 --> 1:04:15.460
I'm porking his wife

1:04:17.027 --> 1:04:18.724
because I love his wife.

1:04:21.248 --> 1:04:23.685
- Why is she his wife if
you two love each other?

1:04:23.772 --> 1:04:25.992
I hear that guy's a
fucking whack job anyway.

1:04:29.778 --> 1:04:32.477
- Wow, you ask a lot of
questions, you know that?

1:04:34.566 --> 1:04:35.567
-  Is there
some way that maybe

1:04:35.654 --> 1:04:36.916
we could just save some time

1:04:37.003 --> 1:04:38.657
and just say you
inspected the car?

1:04:38.744 --> 1:04:41.486
- Oh, no, no, no, this
is not a possibility.

1:04:41.573 --> 1:04:43.401
If I fight with the law,
the law is going to win.

1:04:43.488 --> 1:04:45.142
You know what I mean?

1:04:45.229 --> 1:04:46.056
Hey,

1:04:47.753 --> 1:04:49.668
do you like smut?

1:04:49.755 --> 1:04:50.799
- Smut?

1:04:50.887 --> 1:04:51.975
- Yes, smut,

1:04:52.062 --> 1:04:53.454
dirty pictures.

1:04:53.541 --> 1:04:54.368
Movies.

1:04:55.456 --> 1:04:57.197
I'm asking because I sell it.

1:04:58.459 --> 1:05:00.244
Some are homemade.

1:05:00.331 --> 1:05:02.159
- That's tempting, like, wow,

1:05:02.246 --> 1:05:05.118
but I think we're just
going to have to skip

1:05:05.205 --> 1:05:06.815
on the dirty pictures tonight.

1:05:06.903 --> 1:05:07.816
- Are you sure?

1:05:08.861 --> 1:05:10.254
I could just check the car

1:05:10.341 --> 1:05:12.952
and just drop a box
of mags in the back.

1:05:13.039 --> 1:05:15.215
I give you the best
deal in town, I promise.

1:05:15.302 --> 1:05:16.956
- No, no, I think
we're good, we're good,

1:05:17.043 --> 1:05:18.349
so thanks.

1:05:18.436 --> 1:05:19.654
- Suit yourself.

1:05:19.741 --> 1:05:21.308
Well, here's your car.

1:05:22.222 --> 1:05:23.789
Oh, hold on.

1:05:31.536 --> 1:05:34.147
Okay, I'll check it,

1:05:34.234 --> 1:05:35.670
and we can start
it in the front.

1:05:37.107 --> 1:05:38.456
- So what's the deal here?

1:05:38.543 --> 1:05:40.153
Were you in Jasper's
band or something?

1:05:42.025 --> 1:05:43.940
- I mean, you could say that.

1:05:44.027 --> 1:05:46.377
- You can say whatever you want
me to say. What do you say?

1:05:47.204 --> 1:05:48.727
- You know his first hit?

1:05:48.814 --> 1:05:51.338
- The Girl from Segovia?

1:05:51.425 --> 1:05:52.861
- That's right, yeah.

1:05:52.949 --> 1:05:55.734
- I mean, I know it, but
it's his weakest shit.

1:05:55.821 --> 1:05:57.388
He made a name for
himself doing that, like,

1:05:57.475 --> 1:05:59.564
New Age punk feel stuff,
and then he pulls out

1:05:59.651 --> 1:06:02.567
this jukebox doo wop
bullshit from the '50s.

1:06:02.654 --> 1:06:03.394
- Whoa.
- It's garbage.

1:06:03.481 --> 1:06:04.786
- Whoa, what?

1:06:04.873 --> 1:06:06.571
All right, first of
all, it's not some

1:06:06.658 --> 1:06:09.922
jukebox doo wop shit
from the 50s, okay, okay?

1:06:10.009 --> 1:06:11.141
No.

1:06:11.228 --> 1:06:13.795
And, secondly, I
wrote that song.

1:06:14.709 --> 1:06:15.972
- No!
- Yeah,

1:06:16.059 --> 1:06:17.060
so lay off.
- What?

1:06:17.147 --> 1:06:18.017
- You're hurting my feelings.

1:06:18.104 --> 1:06:20.063
- You wrote that song?

1:06:20.150 --> 1:06:21.064
- I wrote it.

1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:23.762
- All right, well I
kind of take it back.

1:06:23.849 --> 1:06:26.547
It's still pretty
doo woppy, but.

1:06:26.634 --> 1:06:28.506
- I sold it to
him for 200 bucks,

1:06:29.681 --> 1:06:32.249
and agreed to take
my name off it.

1:06:36.427 --> 1:06:37.819
You know.

1:06:37.906 --> 1:06:39.996
So it went gold a couple
times, a few times,

1:06:40.866 --> 1:06:41.867
and, uh,

1:06:43.738 --> 1:06:48.004
he bought a house and a
couple of other things.

1:06:49.179 --> 1:06:50.528
- A bunch of other things.

1:06:52.182 --> 1:06:54.053
Including the girl
you wrote it about?

1:06:56.186 --> 1:06:57.665
- Yeah.

1:06:57.752 --> 1:06:58.797
-  Fuck!

1:06:58.884 --> 1:07:00.581
- Yeah.

1:07:00.668 --> 1:07:02.018
- That sucks.

1:07:02.888 --> 1:07:04.498
- What are you gonna do?

1:07:04.585 --> 1:07:06.413
-  I take back
the jukebox comment.

1:07:06.500 --> 1:07:07.371
- You gotta eat.

1:07:26.738 --> 1:07:27.869
- Okay.

1:07:27.956 --> 1:07:29.001
The insides look great.

1:07:29.088 --> 1:07:30.481
Now let's check the trunk

1:07:30.568 --> 1:07:33.005
and my friends can
be on their way, no?

1:07:46.410 --> 1:07:47.759
Well, that's that.

1:07:49.239 --> 1:07:51.110
Now I just have to
fill out the form,

1:07:51.197 --> 1:07:53.330
unless you guys
changed your mind

1:07:53.417 --> 1:07:55.593
and you want to
buy my dirty pics?

1:07:55.680 --> 1:07:56.550
High quality.

1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:01.642
Then you can be
on your way, okay?

1:08:19.182 --> 1:08:20.008
- Fuck!

1:08:21.619 --> 1:08:23.099
You blew Frankie's head off.

1:08:23.186 --> 1:08:24.230
- I didn't mean to!

1:08:24.317 --> 1:08:26.189
I flinched!
- Oh shit.

1:08:26.276 --> 1:08:29.017
- You shot the thing
and made a noise and--

1:08:29.105 --> 1:08:30.323
- Just shut up, just
get your hands up,

1:08:30.410 --> 1:08:32.804
just get them up!
- Okay, okay.

1:08:34.284 --> 1:08:36.199
- Man, I know he was a
little creepy, but, damn!

1:08:36.286 --> 1:08:37.678
I didn't think you was
gonna blow his head off.

1:08:37.765 --> 1:08:38.984
- All right, what do you want?

1:08:40.638 --> 1:08:42.292
I know you took our fucking
body, what do you want?

1:08:43.641 --> 1:08:44.511
- Our body?

1:08:46.905 --> 1:08:49.908
Well, that's a funny way
of looking at it, honey.

1:08:49.995 --> 1:08:51.649
You do this shit often?

1:08:51.736 --> 1:08:52.737
- No.

1:08:52.824 --> 1:08:53.912
I can't say that I do.

1:08:55.435 --> 1:08:58.003
- I'd have never thought
somebody as privileged

1:08:58.090 --> 1:09:00.919
as Mrs. Jasper Duke
would stroll through here

1:09:01.006 --> 1:09:02.660
with that kind of
trouble onboard.

1:09:02.747 --> 1:09:04.009
- What do you want?

1:09:04.096 --> 1:09:06.054
- $50,000, cash.

1:09:08.187 --> 1:09:10.189
And, in return, I'll get rid

1:09:10.276 --> 1:09:12.278
of that smut-dealing
scumbag the same way

1:09:12.365 --> 1:09:13.497
I did your first body.

1:09:14.411 --> 1:09:16.761
- Okay, 50,000 cash, no problem.

1:09:16.848 --> 1:09:17.936
- What the fuck?

1:09:18.023 --> 1:09:18.980
-  What the fuck?

1:09:20.721 --> 1:09:21.461
-  Whoa!

1:09:24.203 --> 1:09:25.073
Goddamn it!

1:10:07.377 --> 1:10:08.639
- Zach?

1:10:08.726 --> 1:10:10.075
What the hell are
you doing here?

1:10:10.162 --> 1:10:11.163
- Jesus Christ, you're
covered in blood!

1:10:11.250 --> 1:10:12.295
What happened out there?

1:10:12.382 --> 1:10:13.905
- Nothing, put the camera down.

1:10:13.992 --> 1:10:15.907
-  No way, this
shit is priceless.

1:10:15.994 --> 1:10:17.952
- Goddamn it, you
put the camera down,

1:10:18.039 --> 1:10:19.084
or I'm gonna walk over--

1:10:19.171 --> 1:10:20.781
- Enough, enough, both of you!

1:10:20.868 --> 1:10:22.566
Jesus Christ, Jasper's
gonna be back in 20 minutes,

1:10:22.653 --> 1:10:24.176
so just knock it off.

1:10:24.263 --> 1:10:25.308
- Are we going to
Jasper Duke's house?

1:10:25.395 --> 1:10:26.657
- Shut up!

1:10:26.744 --> 1:10:27.527
You, get me two
bags up there, okay?

1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:30.182
-  What am I
supposed to do now?

1:10:30.269 --> 1:10:31.009
- Help him with the
bodies, let's go!

1:10:31.096 --> 1:10:31.966
- More bodies?

1:10:32.924 --> 1:10:34.317
-  You, bags, now.

1:10:34.404 --> 1:10:35.405
- Here, take them.

1:10:43.021 --> 1:10:44.240
- Hey, what do you
think this chick

1:10:44.327 --> 1:10:45.676
did with Sebastian's body?

1:10:46.894 --> 1:10:49.070
- I have no idea, she
said she disposed of it.

1:10:49.157 --> 1:10:50.333
Grab her feet.

1:10:50.420 --> 1:10:52.422
- What if she's full of shit?

1:10:52.509 --> 1:10:53.423
- No, like.

1:10:55.338 --> 1:10:57.340
- What if she just
left, like, his body

1:10:57.427 --> 1:10:59.124
laying around somewhere,
like under some car

1:10:59.211 --> 1:10:59.994
or something?

1:11:01.474 --> 1:11:02.954
- If she took the time
to clean the trunk,

1:11:03.041 --> 1:11:04.390
I'm pretty sure she
disposed of the body, okay?

1:11:04.477 --> 1:11:05.435
She's not an idiot.

1:11:07.088 --> 1:11:09.352
- You assume that she's
not an idiot based on what?

1:11:09.439 --> 1:11:10.875
You know, that she's
trying to blackmail

1:11:10.962 --> 1:11:13.399
a bunch of people that
she knows are murderers?

1:11:13.486 --> 1:11:14.661
You gotta think, Marcus,
I keep telling you,

1:11:14.748 --> 1:11:16.402
you gotta think.

1:11:16.489 --> 1:11:18.622
- If you wanna go look for
him, please, be my guest,

1:11:18.709 --> 1:11:20.232
but I'm gonna load up this body

1:11:20.319 --> 1:11:21.842
while you're doing that, okay?

1:11:21.929 --> 1:11:23.540
- The whole point of
getting to Sebastian's body

1:11:23.627 --> 1:11:26.456
in the first place,
aside from, you know,

1:11:26.543 --> 1:11:29.502
not going to jail, was
getting Nikki's rings, right?

1:11:29.589 --> 1:11:31.374
- I think we have more
important things to worry about,

1:11:31.461 --> 1:11:33.419
like avoiding death by
Jasper when we get home,

1:11:33.506 --> 1:11:35.987
and, uh, you know, disposing
of multiple homicides,

1:11:36.074 --> 1:11:37.771
but, please, be my guest.

1:11:37.858 --> 1:11:40.774
I'll just sit here and wait
while you go look for him.

1:11:47.825 --> 1:11:49.522
- You look a little down.

1:11:55.223 --> 1:11:58.270
- I have a lot on
my mind right now.

1:11:58.357 --> 1:12:00.403
- Did you shoot somebody?

1:12:02.187 --> 1:12:04.668
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1:12:06.887 --> 1:12:07.671
- Help me.

1:12:07.758 --> 1:12:08.585
All right, ready?

1:12:08.672 --> 1:12:09.629
One, two.

1:12:11.327 --> 1:12:13.633
Ah, we gotta go on three.

1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:14.939
No, no, on three.

1:12:17.333 --> 1:12:18.246
-  Is that
what I think it is?

1:12:18.334 --> 1:12:19.596
- Stop asking questions.

1:12:19.683 --> 1:12:20.988
You're not even
supposed to be here.

1:12:21.075 --> 1:12:23.730
- What he means is
he's gonna tell you

1:12:23.817 --> 1:12:25.297
all about it when you're older.

1:12:25.384 --> 1:12:26.298
-  Right.

1:12:26.385 --> 1:12:27.952
Just stay out of this.

1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:30.955
-  I was practicing.

1:12:31.042 --> 1:12:32.391
- So she really is pregnant.

1:12:33.392 --> 1:12:35.002
-  Yeah, yeah, she is.

1:12:35.089 --> 1:12:36.961
-  Well,
congratulations.

1:12:37.048 --> 1:12:37.918
-  Thank you.

1:12:38.005 --> 1:12:39.180
- Congrats on the kid.

1:12:41.226 --> 1:12:42.532
- Thanks.

1:12:53.369 --> 1:12:54.979
-  What's next?

1:12:55.066 --> 1:12:57.155
I mean, after we clean up
all this and settle it,

1:12:57.242 --> 1:12:58.069
if we do,

1:12:59.723 --> 1:13:00.767
what then?

1:13:13.301 --> 1:13:15.173
- I'm sorry I stabbed you, Kyle.

1:13:21.266 --> 1:13:22.093
- Okay.

1:13:25.575 --> 1:13:26.402
Okay.

1:13:32.799 --> 1:13:36.237
Hey, what's the little boy,
the child, doing in the truck?

1:13:36.324 --> 1:13:37.500
- I'm not going to let
my son see that mess.

1:13:37.587 --> 1:13:40.503
That would fuck him up.

1:13:40.590 --> 1:13:42.809
-  Oh, okay, but
the bodies in the truck

1:13:42.896 --> 1:13:44.289
are doing him a lot better?

1:13:45.377 --> 1:13:47.118
- You know what,
I think you guys

1:13:47.205 --> 1:13:49.207
are gonna make really
great parents someday

1:13:49.294 --> 1:13:51.514
whenever that thing pops out.
- You gotta think.

1:13:51.601 --> 1:13:52.776
- But until then, you
know, maybe if you guys

1:13:52.863 --> 1:13:54.430
could just do me a favor

1:13:54.517 --> 1:13:58.346
and stop talking until
we can get through this

1:13:58.434 --> 1:13:59.217
and, uh .

1:13:59.304 --> 1:14:00.218
- Jasper!

1:14:00.305 --> 1:14:01.349
- Whoa, whoa.

1:14:01.437 --> 1:14:02.699
- Sorry about that, sugar tits.

1:14:05.702 --> 1:14:07.268
The shot was meant for you.

1:14:07.355 --> 1:14:08.835
Who the fuck is he?

1:14:12.317 --> 1:14:14.798
Kyle, are you fucking my wife?

1:14:15.973 --> 1:14:17.627
That is my shirt.

1:14:17.714 --> 1:14:19.106
-  Easy with the gun,
come on, come on, come on.

1:15:18.949 --> 1:15:21.081
- I would offer you some booze

1:15:21.168 --> 1:15:23.475
or a microwaved meal,

1:15:23.562 --> 1:15:27.610
but, seeing as least one
of you fucked my wife,

1:15:27.697 --> 1:15:29.829
I don't really owe you
anything, now do I?

1:15:31.222 --> 1:15:32.310
- Jasper, I'm not fucking
either one of them,

1:15:32.397 --> 1:15:33.224
I promise.

1:15:39.404 --> 1:15:41.537
- What's the matter, Nik?

1:15:44.148 --> 1:15:45.018
I thought

1:15:46.498 --> 1:15:49.327
we were something special.

1:15:49.414 --> 1:15:50.546
- We are, we are.

1:15:52.896 --> 1:15:55.376
You're just imagining things.

1:15:57.378 --> 1:15:58.554
I forgot my rings.

1:16:01.165 --> 1:16:01.948
I swear.

1:16:12.742 --> 1:16:15.875
- Do you know what they
call an orgasm in France?

1:16:15.962 --> 1:16:17.660
It's not the official name,

1:16:17.747 --> 1:16:19.749
but it's a euphemism.

1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:22.534
It's a figure of speech.

1:16:23.883 --> 1:16:25.929
- No.

1:16:29.846 --> 1:16:31.717
- That's what they call it.

1:16:31.804 --> 1:16:33.763
But do you know what
it actually means?

1:16:37.984 --> 1:16:39.595
- The little death.

1:16:43.773 --> 1:16:46.471
- Jacques Fucking Cousteau here.

1:16:47.385 --> 1:16:48.734
I'm very well impressed.

1:16:49.909 --> 1:16:54.000
But do you know why
they call it that, eh?

1:16:56.307 --> 1:16:57.134
Any ideas?

1:16:58.614 --> 1:17:01.442
Well, I'll tell you
why they call it that.

1:17:01.529 --> 1:17:03.662
They call it that

1:17:03.749 --> 1:17:07.710
because of the life force
you fucking toss out

1:17:07.797 --> 1:17:09.668
every time you get
your rocks out.

1:17:11.148 --> 1:17:14.586
It's that exhausted
bliss feeling

1:17:14.673 --> 1:17:16.501
that we've come to know so well.

1:17:17.458 --> 1:17:19.069
It's almost like
dying, isn't it?

1:17:20.157 --> 1:17:21.114
Hence the name.

1:17:22.463 --> 1:17:26.206
You see, I was on
tour in France,

1:17:28.513 --> 1:17:31.908
and I started thinking about it,

1:17:31.995 --> 1:17:35.172
and then I started
philosophizing,

1:17:35.259 --> 1:17:37.043
and I came up with this theory.

1:17:38.262 --> 1:17:41.482
From when you're born,
you're always looking

1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:43.659
for a way to die.

1:17:45.356 --> 1:17:47.358
From when we were nothing,

1:17:47.445 --> 1:17:50.622
before we swam into
our daddies' balls

1:17:50.709 --> 1:17:54.321
and weaseled our way
into our mommies' eggs,

1:17:54.408 --> 1:17:57.760
we were nothing, and
then we were kids

1:17:57.847 --> 1:17:59.587
and teenagers, and
we were reckless,

1:17:59.675 --> 1:18:02.460
we didn't care, we never
thought about the consequences,

1:18:03.983 --> 1:18:05.289
but, you see, as we get older,

1:18:05.376 --> 1:18:08.771
that wildness starts to fade.

1:18:08.858 --> 1:18:10.773
But I would argue it was because

1:18:10.860 --> 1:18:12.818
we were further
away from nothing,

1:18:14.037 --> 1:18:17.736
far away from the
peace and the ease

1:18:17.823 --> 1:18:19.259
of non-existence.

1:18:21.566 --> 1:18:22.959
You see, as kids,

1:18:24.525 --> 1:18:26.179
I don't remember fearing death

1:18:27.572 --> 1:18:30.096
because we remembered what
it was like to not be,

1:18:32.533 --> 1:18:34.448
but as we grow older,

1:18:34.535 --> 1:18:35.841
as we gain age,

1:18:37.016 --> 1:18:40.498
we start to look for it
in our everyday lives,

1:18:40.585 --> 1:18:45.242
seeking this little death
in an unconscious fashion,

1:18:45.329 --> 1:18:48.811
looking for somebody to fuck.

1:18:48.898 --> 1:18:50.203
- Jasper, what are
you talking about?

1:18:50.290 --> 1:18:54.686
- However, as problems arise,

1:18:56.601 --> 1:18:59.473
fucking just doesn't
do it for you anymore.

1:19:01.824 --> 1:19:05.001
So what I would like is for her

1:19:05.088 --> 1:19:09.614
to have that death
experience one more time,

1:19:11.442 --> 1:19:12.356
just for kicks.

1:19:14.488 --> 1:19:16.229
I got to show you something.

1:19:16.316 --> 1:19:17.448
You're gonna like this.

1:19:19.493 --> 1:19:22.975
- No, no, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Jasper, what the fuck?

1:19:24.672 --> 1:19:25.499
- What's the matter?

1:19:25.586 --> 1:19:26.587
Cat got your tongue?

1:19:28.459 --> 1:19:32.985
Ah, I collect guns.

1:19:33.072 --> 1:19:35.422
But you probably
already know that,

1:19:35.509 --> 1:19:37.860
seeing as my beautiful
wife has shown you

1:19:37.947 --> 1:19:41.211
the intimate portions
of our lovely house.

1:19:42.821 --> 1:19:43.648
But this gun,

1:19:45.781 --> 1:19:47.260
this is my favorite gun.

1:19:52.788 --> 1:19:55.878
I think it's time we
play a little game,

1:19:55.965 --> 1:20:00.926
called Please God, Don't Let
Me Blow My Fucking Brains Out.

1:20:05.104 --> 1:20:09.500
I hope Nikki feels that
little death feeling again.

1:20:13.983 --> 1:20:16.072
- Please, put the
gun down, please.

1:20:16.159 --> 1:20:17.203
- Shall we go?

1:20:17.290 --> 1:20:18.726
- Jesus, Jasper, don't, don't!

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:20.467
- Fuck!

1:20:21.555 --> 1:20:25.777
- Yeah!

1:20:26.865 --> 1:20:27.866
You feel that?

1:20:32.784 --> 1:20:34.177
Your turn, sweet potato.

1:20:37.223 --> 1:20:39.095
- Don't fucking touch it.

1:20:39.182 --> 1:20:40.618
Don't touch that gun.

1:20:40.705 --> 1:20:43.012
Nikki, don't touch that gun.

1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:46.363
- Either pick up that gun

1:20:47.364 --> 1:20:50.584
or I'm gonna blow you, Kyle,

1:20:50.671 --> 1:20:53.022
and Jacques Fucking
Cousteau over there

1:20:53.979 --> 1:20:54.850
into .

1:20:56.939 --> 1:20:58.592
Do you know what
that means, Kyle?

1:20:59.637 --> 1:21:00.725
- The big death.

1:21:00.812 --> 1:21:02.161
- The big fucking death.

1:21:05.034 --> 1:21:06.557
Well, come on then, girl.

1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:09.603
Give it a whirl.

1:21:09.690 --> 1:21:11.257
- Hey, no, no, no,
no, no, please, Nikki,

1:21:11.344 --> 1:21:13.999
look at me, Nikki, don't,
put the gun down, Nikki!

1:21:14.086 --> 1:21:15.087
Nikki, please, I'm begging you

1:21:15.174 --> 1:21:16.480
to put the fucking gun down!

1:21:16.567 --> 1:21:18.003
- Kyle!

1:21:18.090 --> 1:21:19.483
If you want to talk, you
better have something

1:21:19.570 --> 1:21:21.006
better to say.
- Don't fucking make her do

1:21:21.093 --> 1:21:22.138
this to her.
- I mean, at least be frothing

1:21:22.225 --> 1:21:24.096
at the mouth like
some old raconteur,

1:21:24.183 --> 1:21:27.665
telling stories of great
love lost and heartbreak.

1:21:27.752 --> 1:21:28.666
Do it.

1:21:28.753 --> 1:21:29.493
-  No.

1:21:29.580 --> 1:21:30.886
- You do it!

1:21:30.973 --> 1:21:32.017
- Please, Nikki,
fucking stop, Nikki!

1:21:32.104 --> 1:21:33.540
Nikki, don't fucking do.

1:21:33.627 --> 1:21:34.541
Jasper, she's fucking

1:21:34.628 --> 1:21:35.238
pregnant!

1:21:35.325 --> 1:21:36.152
Fuck!

1:21:45.944 --> 1:21:48.860
- Gave you that rush, didn't it?

1:21:48.947 --> 1:21:50.470
How does it make you feel, Nik?

1:21:52.124 --> 1:21:55.171
Does it make you warm
down in your lady parts?

1:21:55.258 --> 1:21:56.955
- Would you fucking
stop fucking--

1:21:57.042 --> 1:21:58.914
- Don't you say anything.

1:22:00.089 --> 1:22:02.091
One more word out of
you that's not special

1:22:02.178 --> 1:22:05.485
and I will murder you.

1:22:05.572 --> 1:22:07.879
You think I'm fucking
dumb, don't you?

1:22:07.966 --> 1:22:11.404
You think I don't know that
you're fucking my wife.

1:22:12.318 --> 1:22:13.276
Well, I'm not dumb.

1:22:14.451 --> 1:22:15.931
I'm actually very intelligent.

1:22:17.454 --> 1:22:20.718
She, on the other
hand, is very easy.

1:22:24.069 --> 1:22:26.463
Now, answer my question, Nik.

1:22:29.814 --> 1:22:32.034
- Yeah, it felt
fucking great, Jasper.

1:22:32.121 --> 1:22:33.557
- That's what I want to hear.

1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:39.345
Give me the gun.

1:22:52.315 --> 1:22:54.099
This is why we do this.

1:22:56.710 --> 1:23:00.671
We do it to make us feel
the true pleasures of life.

1:23:09.636 --> 1:23:10.507
What a rush.

1:23:13.640 --> 1:23:17.993
My piss is burning
throughout my body.

1:23:19.951 --> 1:23:21.474
How are you boys?

1:23:21.561 --> 1:23:22.432
You feeling good?

1:23:27.350 --> 1:23:30.309
It's your turn, pumpkin patch.

1:23:30.396 --> 1:23:34.009
Three down, two
lucky strikes to go.

1:23:42.930 --> 1:23:44.976
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, Jasper,

1:23:45.063 --> 1:23:47.805
okay, okay, I have
a really good story.

1:23:47.892 --> 1:23:50.155
You'll like it, it's
like a special story.

1:23:50.242 --> 1:23:51.852
- All right, friend.

1:23:51.939 --> 1:23:53.680
You go and tell it.

1:23:53.767 --> 1:23:55.769
- I once knew these
people, right,

1:23:55.856 --> 1:23:57.380
and they were in love,

1:23:57.467 --> 1:23:59.599
and the girl, she was
beautiful and young,

1:23:59.686 --> 1:24:01.906
and the guy, he was
pretty much a mess

1:24:01.993 --> 1:24:03.473
in every single way, he
was like a degenerate,

1:24:03.560 --> 1:24:05.301
but it worked out for a while

1:24:05.388 --> 1:24:07.259
because, you know, they
loved each other so much.

1:24:07.346 --> 1:24:10.001
- You got five seconds.
- I know, I'm talking.

1:24:10.088 --> 1:24:11.829
And the guy, he was into
drugs, and the girl,

1:24:11.916 --> 1:24:14.353
she was just afraid that
he wasn't right for her,

1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:16.355
but what the girl didn't know

1:24:17.748 --> 1:24:19.880
was that he loved her
more than anything,

1:24:19.967 --> 1:24:21.143
more than anything in
the world, you know.

1:24:21.230 --> 1:24:23.014
And anybody who knows this guy,

1:24:23.101 --> 1:24:24.450
they could tell this is true

1:24:24.537 --> 1:24:26.409
because he wrote a
song about this girl,

1:24:28.106 --> 1:24:30.369
a song that she loved and a song

1:24:30.456 --> 1:24:31.936
that she always secretly thought

1:24:32.023 --> 1:24:34.678
that someone wrote for her.
- One Mississippi.

1:24:34.765 --> 1:24:36.288
- He writes this song,
right, but he never told her

1:24:36.375 --> 1:24:38.160
because he didn't
want to mess things up

1:24:38.247 --> 1:24:40.510
with her and the
other guy in her life.

1:24:40.597 --> 1:24:41.989
And she was with him
for whatever reason,

1:24:42.077 --> 1:24:44.514
maybe because things
were easier for her.

1:24:44.601 --> 1:24:46.081
- Two Mississippi.

1:24:46.168 --> 1:24:48.387
- And then one day,
something happened, Jasper.

1:24:49.432 --> 1:24:50.433
Something happened.

1:24:51.260 --> 1:24:52.435
This girl got pregnant,

1:24:53.566 --> 1:24:55.220
and this degenerate guy,

1:24:57.222 --> 1:24:58.963
he decided that she
was worth any risk.

1:24:59.050 --> 1:25:00.747
- Three Mississippi.

1:25:00.834 --> 1:25:02.445
- Any sacrifice in the world,

1:25:02.532 --> 1:25:05.752
and so he told her that
he'd be done with the drugs,

1:25:05.839 --> 1:25:07.276
and he'd be done with
the bad decisions.

1:25:07.363 --> 1:25:08.929
- Four Mississippi.

1:25:10.148 --> 1:25:10.931
- And then

1:25:12.585 --> 1:25:13.630
he vowed to her

1:25:15.849 --> 1:25:18.461
that he would write her
another Girl From Segovia

1:25:18.548 --> 1:25:20.071
if she would just use
that gun in her hand

1:25:20.158 --> 1:25:22.813
to get them out of this
fucked up situation.

1:25:24.467 --> 1:25:26.947
- You wrote that song?

1:25:27.034 --> 1:25:28.297
- Five Mississippi.

1:25:28.384 --> 1:25:29.646
- Duck, Marcus!

1:25:38.002 --> 1:25:38.959
- Baby, baby.

1:25:39.046 --> 1:25:39.960
- It's yours.

1:25:40.047 --> 1:25:40.961
- What?
- It's yours.

1:25:41.048 --> 1:25:42.659
- What?
- It's yours.

1:25:42.746 --> 1:25:44.313
It's your baby, the baby,
it's yours, it's all yours.

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:45.444
I knew all along, but I
was too afraid to admit it.

1:25:45.531 --> 1:25:46.706
I should have told
you, I'm so sorry.

1:25:46.793 --> 1:25:47.664
I'm so sorry.

1:25:47.751 --> 1:25:48.839
- You kept your promise.

1:25:48.926 --> 1:25:50.232
- You really wrote that song?

1:25:50.319 --> 1:25:52.190
- Of course I wrote it.

1:25:52.277 --> 1:25:53.235
I fucking love you.

1:25:53.322 --> 1:25:54.105
- I love you, too.

1:25:54.192 --> 1:25:55.019
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:25:57.195 --> 1:25:58.109
-  Hey, Dad.

1:25:58.196 --> 1:25:59.458
- Zach.

1:25:59.545 --> 1:26:01.373
- I think I found your fingers.
