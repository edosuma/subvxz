          The emotions
 for the entire house, you know?
I do.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.187
   Possibly the entire block.
Okay.

19:16.189 --> 19:19.257
            I just --
  and maybe that's why
you don't feel anything.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.658
                   I feel stuff.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.527
   Really? Because when we were
      sick a few weeks ago,

19:22.529 --> 19:24.028
     You didn't seem to care.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.596
                  I didn't care.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.932
Well, she's not a liar.
We did something right.
             Mm-hmm.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.700
 Don't you think you should have
       cared a little bit?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.968
                   Why?
          You always get better.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.171
 Well...So far.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.972
               What do you mean,
                   "so far"?

19:34.974 --> 19:36.040
Um...
           Well, uh...

19:36.042 --> 19:38.042
        Like someday, you're not
           gonna get better?

19:38.044 --> 19:39.644
          Like you're gonna die?

19:39.646 --> 19:42.980
    No! No, no, no, no. Not --
 not for a very, very long time.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.782
         Then why are we talking
              about it now?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.117
     Well, hey,
 you brought it up.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.218
         I just wanted to
        make sure that --

19:47.220 --> 19:49.120
                   Stop!
           You're making me sad!

19:49.122 --> 19:51.122
   Okay, well, she has feelings.

19:51.124 --> 19:53.991
 Well, yes, and it seems that
 she wants to keep us alive.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.393
             So all in all,
        a good day of parenting.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.695
    Lily: I don't want to live
        with aunt claire!

19:57.697 --> 19:59.363
                             Oh.
Lily!

19:59.365 --> 20:04.168
Gloria: Parents make so many
mistakes with their children...

20:04.170 --> 20:05.836
I've alive, sweetheart.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.572
           But what about daddy?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.006
I'm alive, too.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.241
                      Come here.
Come on, sweetheart.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.976
  Gloria: But it's only because
       we're trying so hard

20:11.978 --> 20:14.245
       To make them happy.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.580
Not her. Not her.
   Oh, my god.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.748
You're gonna be the cutest girl
     at this whole school.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.051
Wait, these are girls, right?

20:20.053 --> 20:23.221
    [ alex and haley giggle ]

20:23.223 --> 20:26.224
      Gloria: Trying so hard
      to keep them close...

20:28.260 --> 20:29.894
                You could knock.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.829
             Gloria:
  Even though we know we can't.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.265
       I know someday I'm gonna
      lose you to another woman,

20:34.267 --> 20:36.500
             And I'll find a way
             to be okay with it.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.735
 Thanks, kylie.

20:39.204 --> 20:40.338
                  But not today.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.509
      So I walk into his office.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.044
 He's looking at a picture of me
         and he's crying.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.879
Your dad?
               Yeah,
   I couldn't believe it either.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.716
 This is why I'm glad I show my
emotions in front of the girls.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.184
I think that's the reason
    they're feeling --

20:53.186 --> 20:54.518
         Phil, could we at least
             stay on my story

20:54.520 --> 20:55.920
        Until the oven preheats?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.855
           Sorry.
I thought you were finished.
                             No.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.624
               Okay, so anyway,
              I went back later,

20:59.626 --> 21:01.292
                And it turns out
               he wasn't crying,

21:01.294 --> 21:03.361
                 He was plucking
                 his nose hairs.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.096
I didn't expect that.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.631
               Yeah, me neither.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.199
   To walk into that theater
and see their cute little heads

21:08.201 --> 21:10.801
Together after they'd been
  fighting all afternoon.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.903
                       [ sighs ]
come on. You had to have been
       done that time.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.238
                   No. Is it me?
       [ knife clatters ]

21:14.240 --> 21:16.741
               Is it the way
            that I tell stories?

21:16.743 --> 21:21.412
Am I so boring or is everyone in
this family that self-involved?

21:21.414 --> 21:23.047
              As I was saying...

21:23.049 --> 21:25.216
        Her name is alaina
  and she's from north carolina.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.051
             That's my roommate.
