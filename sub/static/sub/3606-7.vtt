00:00.634 --> 00:04.303
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:07.873
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:09.808
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:09.810 --> 00:11.543
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:11.545 --> 00:15.547
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become Superman.</i>

00:15.549 --> 00:17.416
<i> And so I hide my powers</i>

00:17.418 --> 00:22.154
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.156 --> 00:25.557
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:25.559 --> 00:29.261
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.263 --> 00:31.030
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:33.899
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.102 --> 00:37.770
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.773 --> 00:40.539
Alex:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:40.541 --> 00:43.742
Hank henshaw was
the last person
to see your father alive.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.644
Alex: Maybe the man
that I've been working with

00:45.646 --> 00:48.380
for the last two years
killed my father.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.183
No one can be allowed
to stand against us.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.618
Not even my niece.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.086
Dr. Morrow:
<i> I call it red tornado.</i>

00:54.088 --> 00:55.921
The android wasn't meant
to fight insurgents.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.357
It was designed to kill
Kryptonians.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.958
(Screaming)

01:02.763 --> 01:04.530
Supergirl, are you okay?

01:04.532 --> 01:05.864
-(Glass cracking)
-(Both gasping)

01:05.866 --> 01:07.599
Be careful, you might
cut yourself.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.735
Are you all right?

01:09.737 --> 01:12.271
No. I'm bleeding.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.510
Alura: <i> The loss of your powers</i>
<i> is undeniably traumatic.</i>

01:18.512 --> 01:20.045
<i> You may feel confused,</i>

01:20.047 --> 01:22.214
<i> or even frightened</i>
<i> they're lost forever.</i>

01:22.216 --> 01:26.785
<i> Your battle with the android</i>
<i> drained your Kryptonian cells</i>
<i> of their solar energy.</i>

01:26.787 --> 01:30.522
<i> You are now as vulnerable</i>
<i> to your environment</i>
<i> as any human,</i>

01:30.524 --> 01:32.291
<i> subject to pain, sickness,</i>

01:32.726 --> 01:34.359
<i> death.</i>

01:34.361 --> 01:35.928
<i> But have faith, Kara.</i>

01:35.930 --> 01:37.429
<i> Once your cells</i>
<i> have reabsorbed</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:40.532
<i> sufficient radiation</i>
<i> from earth's yellow star,</i>

01:40.534 --> 01:42.634
<i> your powers should return.</i>

01:42.636 --> 01:44.036
<i> Do not be afraid.</i>

01:44.038 --> 01:46.305
<i> And until</i>
<i> you have fully recovered,</i>

01:46.307 --> 01:48.407
<i> lean on those you trust.</i>

01:48.409 --> 01:51.710
It is my deep regret
that I am unable
to be there with you myself,

01:51.712 --> 01:53.278
my beloved daughter.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.715
As always, my collected
knowledge is at your disposal

01:56.717 --> 01:58.317
for further analysis.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.418
Thank you,

02:01.288 --> 02:02.721
mom. (Sighs)

02:03.891 --> 02:05.491
This happens to Superman too,

02:05.493 --> 02:07.559
where he loses his powers
for a couple days, right?

02:07.561 --> 02:10.429
Yeah, but it's been two days,
and I don't
feel any different.

02:10.431 --> 02:15.000
You're just going stir-crazy
because the deo has been
testing you all weekend.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.401
Now you get to go out
in the real world

02:16.403 --> 02:18.837
and see what it's like
to be human for a day.

02:18.839 --> 02:22.441
Hank henshaw: Might learn
a thing or two about what
it's like for the rest of us.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.143
-How you feeling?
-Fine.

02:24.145 --> 02:28.046
I guess...
(Sighs) If this is what fine
feels like now.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.349
Kara is heading to work.
I was just going
to walk her out.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.650
Hmm.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.118
I'm off to deal
with an unruly guest.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.620
Might need your help with him
when you're done.

02:34.622 --> 02:35.888
Happy to, sir.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.294
Nice.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.196
I'd have no idea
you suspect him of anything.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.964
I have to play it that way
until I find out

02:45.966 --> 02:47.799
whether or not he was
involved in dad's death.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.768
Do you really think
he's involved?

02:49.770 --> 02:51.703
You've served with Hank
for years.

02:51.705 --> 02:55.007
And all that time, he never
told me dad was an agent
here at the deo.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.675
Or that they were together
when dad died.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.110
Ev...

02:59.313 --> 03:03.182
Everything Hank has said to me
has been a lie.

03:03.184 --> 03:06.051
I can't trust him
anymore, Kara. I...

03:06.053 --> 03:08.053
I know he's hiding something.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.622
(Elevator dings)

03:10.624 --> 03:12.090
(Sneezes)

03:12.860 --> 03:14.459
Sorry. (Sniffles)

03:15.896 --> 03:18.363
-(Sighs)
-Hey, Kara. (Stammering)
What's happening?

03:18.365 --> 03:21.900
Oh, there was a 10-year-old
on the bus with a runny nose.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.069
Okay, you're late,
you took the bus

03:24.071 --> 03:26.038
and, what, you have...
You have a cold?

03:26.040 --> 03:28.941
I blew out my powers
fighting that android.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.309
What? For how long?

03:30.311 --> 03:32.177
Oh, stupid red tornado.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.279
Okay, I'm going to help you
figure this out.

03:34.281 --> 03:37.282
Oh, I still have the, uh...
The Kryptonian bio-analytics
from Alex's deo files.

03:37.284 --> 03:38.350
(Sneezes)

03:38.352 --> 03:39.785
Yeah, we've got to
find some answers.

03:39.787 --> 03:43.055
Did someone just sneeze?

03:45.326 --> 03:47.226
Who did that?

03:47.228 --> 03:49.228
Who among you
sprayed my office

03:49.230 --> 03:51.230
with a million
microscopic killers?

03:51.232 --> 03:54.633
I can already feel
my throat closing up.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.535
-(Sneezes)
-(Gasps)

03:56.537 --> 03:59.304
You, ker-rah?

03:59.306 --> 04:02.007
You never get sick.
That's the best part
about you.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.176
-That's the best part?
-Cat: If I get sick,

04:04.178 --> 04:06.111
I will underperform.
If I underperform,

04:06.113 --> 04:09.514
our stock prices will fall,
thousands of people
will lose their job,

04:09.516 --> 04:11.149
the s&p will take a hit

04:11.151 --> 04:13.418
and you will personally have
triggered the next recession.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.887
Do you want to be
the next lehman brothers?

04:15.889 --> 04:17.522
I guess I'll go home.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.995
Don't exhale on the way out.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.310
Worn yourself out yet?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.912
Bow your head
when you approach me!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.148
I am jemm,

04:43.150 --> 04:45.250
master of
the faceless hunters!

04:45.252 --> 04:47.252
-Conqueror of...
-Twelve worlds.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.521
Yeah, heard you
the first 10 times.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.456
It's not getting
any more impressive.

04:53.927 --> 04:57.062
Trying to use your
psychic powers, aren't you?

04:57.064 --> 04:59.665
Take control of my mind,
force me to let you out?

04:59.667 --> 05:02.834
Hate to break it to you, jemm,
but your cell
has neural shielding.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.236
Your powers are useless.

05:04.238 --> 05:05.504
(Grunts softly)

05:05.506 --> 05:07.339
Then deactivate it

05:07.341 --> 05:11.510
so that I may
expose your true identity

05:11.512 --> 05:13.845
as a coward.

05:13.847 --> 05:17.449
I will grind
your loved ones to dust.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.454
There are none left to grind.

05:28.062 --> 05:30.996
Jemm's fish tank is in need
of its monthly cleaning.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.597
Copy that. I'm on it.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.180
Hey, hey.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.148
Hi! (Chuckles)
Where are you headed?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.384
Uh, look at a rental.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.320
Lucy and I are getting
a place together actually.

05:55.322 --> 05:58.156
That's... that's awesome.
(Chuckles)

05:58.625 --> 06:00.092
(Sneezes)

06:01.428 --> 06:02.994
Lost your powers.

06:03.630 --> 06:04.896
Solar flare.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.032
I did not know
we were calling it that.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.533
Well, he does.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.069
Well, he likes to name them.
You know, heat vision,

06:11.071 --> 06:13.171
-freeze breath...
-He's such a nerd.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.673
(Laughs)

06:14.675 --> 06:18.844
I don't know, today,
I'm less girl of steel
and more girl of stucco.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.078
Oh, you'll be all right.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.947
Just lay low

06:21.949 --> 06:23.949
and enjoy your time off,
you know.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.585
Yeah. You're right.
The world can survive
without Supergirl for one day.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.719
(Chuckles)

06:27.721 --> 06:28.987
(Rumbling)

06:29.690 --> 06:30.956
James: Kara!

06:33.494 --> 06:35.260
(Tires screeching)

06:37.464 --> 06:39.131
(People screaming)

06:43.904 --> 06:45.170
(Grunts)

06:46.440 --> 06:47.672
(Both grunting)

06:50.411 --> 06:53.111
-Initiating prisoner airlock.
-(Machine beeps)

06:53.714 --> 06:56.214
(Rumbling)

06:58.285 --> 07:00.952
We lost power!
Switching to emergency!

07:00.954 --> 07:02.254
I need eyes on the prisoner!

07:02.256 --> 07:04.256
System is rebooting now.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.496
Hostile is loose.
Seal the base.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.634
I said seal the base!

07:15.636 --> 07:17.502
(Alarm sounding)

07:21.308 --> 07:23.341
-(Both groaning)
-You okay?

07:23.343 --> 07:24.910
No, no.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.344
Might be broken.

07:26.346 --> 07:29.147
-(Crying)
-Oh, god.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.488
-(Groaning)
-Okay, all right. Let's get...
Here.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.766
Oh, my god.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.141
(Helicopter hovering)

07:56.143 --> 07:58.343
(Sirens wailing
in the distance)

08:02.049 --> 08:03.915
(Groans)

08:03.917 --> 08:06.151
-(Breathing heavily)
-You've got to be
really careful with that.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.786
Why don't you let me
take you to the hospital
to get your arm looked at?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.921
No, it'll heal when I get
my powers back.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.356
Are you okay?

08:11.358 --> 08:13.625
-(Cell phone ringing)
-Yeah.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.794
-Alex. Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.162
(Groans) Liar.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.730
-Back at you.
-Kara: <i> Arm's broken here.</i>

08:18.732 --> 08:20.365
Which, by the way,

08:20.367 --> 08:22.801
a warning would've been nice
about how much that hurts.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.703
(Sighs) So, tell me
what's wrong there.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.708
-We're on lockdown.
-Wait, you're sealed
in there with Hank?

08:29.710 --> 08:32.210
It's standard procedure
while we run safety protocols.

08:32.212 --> 08:36.081
Don't worry.
Just keep yourself safe
until your powers come back.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.416
And if they do, call me.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.152
-I love you.
-Love you.

08:42.389 --> 08:46.191
Okay, so, is everyone okay?
Anybody hurt?

08:47.294 --> 08:50.262
Good.
Sometimes it takes a shock

08:50.264 --> 08:51.696
to realize
what really matters.

08:51.698 --> 08:55.267
So, if you need to go,
if you want to go, go.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.335
Go be with your families.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.773
And you. You, are you staying?

09:01.775 --> 09:03.041
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.743
Well, we need to get
my station back online.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.678
People are scared,
they're looking
for information,

09:06.680 --> 09:08.413
and it is our duty
to help them.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.415
We're working on it,
Ms. Grant.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.817
-But best estimate
is four hours.
-Unacceptable.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.686
Think creatively
and get us on the air.

09:18.492 --> 09:21.092
Alura: The situation
you face is dire.

09:21.094 --> 09:25.330
Jemm was one of the most
ruthless criminals ever to be
banished to the phantom zone.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.500
His psychic abilities
surpass any living species,

09:28.502 --> 09:32.337
able to read and control minds
against their will.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.574
Your only chance at survival
is my daughter, Kara.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.142
-Humans cannot...
-Shut it off.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.443
First order of business
is making sure

09:38.445 --> 09:41.179
jemm does not read
our minds in the field.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.682
Alex: R&D developed these,

09:43.684 --> 09:45.417
neural disrupters.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.952
Portable versions
of the energy shield

09:46.954 --> 09:49.120
we use to block jemm's powers
when he's in his cell.

09:49.122 --> 09:52.724
We only have
three disrupters left so,
tsung and Reynolds, gear up.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.192
Let's go, come on!

09:54.194 --> 09:56.628
Sir, I have
more field experience

09:56.630 --> 09:58.463
than Reynolds
and tsung combined.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.398
Which is why I need you
to remain behind
to protect the others.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.436
I have to know I'm leaving
these people with someone
i can trust.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.371
Unless you're implying
you and I have a problem.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.774
-No, sir.
-Good. Glad to hear it.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.378
(Keyboard clacking)

10:13.380 --> 10:16.081
Hey, hey.
You want to see some magic?

10:16.083 --> 10:18.049
(TV beeping)

10:18.051 --> 10:19.317
(Newscast playing)

10:19.319 --> 10:21.853
Winn, that's...
Oh, my gosh. Look.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.823
Oh.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.993
Well, if I didn't have
an issue with personal space,

10:27.995 --> 10:29.461
I would give you a hug.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.296
-It wasn't me.
-It was winn.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.131
-Who?
-Me.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.466
Are you
from the satellite company?

10:34.468 --> 10:36.835
No, he's from the desk
right across from mine

10:36.837 --> 10:40.438
that you pass on your way
to your office every day.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.041
-Oh.
-Maxwell: <i> People need</i>
<i> help now.</i>

10:43.043 --> 10:44.576
<i> This city's a powder keg.</i>

10:44.578 --> 10:46.378
<i> We can't wait around</i>
<i> for the government to save us.</i>

10:46.380 --> 10:48.380
<i> Or Supergirl.</i>

10:48.382 --> 10:50.815
<i> Just when this city</i>
<i> needed her the most,</i>
<i> she's nowhere to be found.</i>

10:50.817 --> 10:53.318
<i> The world's most</i>
<i> unreliable superhero.</i>

10:53.320 --> 10:55.020
<i> Let this be a lesson</i>
<i> to all of us.</i>

10:55.022 --> 10:57.989
<i> We need to rely on ourselves,</i>
<i> not aliens in capes.</i>

10:57.991 --> 10:59.424
Look at Max.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.726
Using the earthquake
as a branding opportunity.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.662
He's sticking it
to Supergirl pretty hard.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.797
Well, I'm not going
to let that
bloviating narcissist

11:05.799 --> 11:09.134
knock my creation down
just to build himself up.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.468
Whit.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.139
That's close enough.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.474
-(Clears throat)
-You've proven yourself
not to be incompetent.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.076
Let's start
a feed in my office.

11:18.078 --> 11:22.147
We are going to counter
Max's message about my girl.

11:22.149 --> 11:25.250
If I'm not back in
in half an hour,

11:25.252 --> 11:26.751
send... send help.

11:26.753 --> 11:29.888
Max is spreading panic.
People are already scared.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.856
-What do you want to do?
-Go down there and stop him.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.359
(Chuckles)
You can't just fly up to him
like you usually do.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.194
I mean, this guy
is waist-deep in security.

11:36.196 --> 11:40.031
Yeah, but he's also
a showman who loves
preening for the press.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.933
And luckily for Supergirl,

11:41.935 --> 11:45.537
she's friends with
pulitzer prize-winning
photographer Jimmy Olsen.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.307
Hank henshaw:
Approaching sector 12.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.922
-Danvers, you see anything?
-Nothing.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.957
Cameras are clear.
Heat sensors, negative.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.393
Yeah, we're getting some kind
of interference on our end.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.028
Earthquake may have
damaged the circuitry.

12:11.665 --> 12:12.864
On me.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.509
Tsung: <i> Lost the lights.</i>

12:24.511 --> 12:25.810
<i> Head lamps on!</i>

12:29.149 --> 12:31.716
<i> Henshaw, are you here?</i>

12:31.718 --> 12:33.818
-We only see two of you.
-Tsung: <i> Where's</i>
<i> director henshaw?</i>

12:33.820 --> 12:36.387
Reynolds: I don't see him!
He's gone.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.626
Be advised, we lost visual.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.762
Tsung:
Hostile is in our sector!

12:43.764 --> 12:45.463
Reynolds: What's he doing
out there?

12:45.465 --> 12:47.031
Tsung: It's like
he's all around us!

12:48.702 --> 12:51.336
(Flatlines)

12:51.338 --> 12:53.037
-Donovan: Two agents down.
-(Sighs)

12:54.775 --> 12:56.941
What happened
to director henshaw?

13:01.815 --> 13:04.315
(Camera clicking)

13:04.317 --> 13:06.751
Jimmy Olsen.
Thank you for shooting
our relief efforts.

13:06.753 --> 13:09.053
-Of course.
-I'd heard you
hung up your camera.

13:09.055 --> 13:12.557
Ah, well, I still break it out
when the need arises.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.392
-You look familiar.
-We've met.

13:14.394 --> 13:18.263
Um, I'm cat Grant's
assistant, Kara.

13:18.265 --> 13:21.966
I... I have to say,
i think what you're doing
today is wonderful.

13:21.968 --> 13:25.503
But, uh, I found what you said
on TV a little

13:26.640 --> 13:28.573
-surprising.
-You mean about Supergirl?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.175
If you knew me,
you wouldn't be surprised.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.277
Oh, I know you. (Chuckles)

13:32.279 --> 13:33.812
But...
But don't you think that...

13:33.814 --> 13:36.447
That people need a more
positive message right now?

13:36.449 --> 13:38.650
Hope instead of fear?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.819
I just think that if Supergirl
could be here today,

13:40.821 --> 13:43.121
-right now, she would be.
-(Snickers) Why?

13:43.123 --> 13:44.889
Because cat Grant says so?

13:44.891 --> 13:46.858
She might as well be
Supergirl's PR flack,

13:46.860 --> 13:49.494
slapping that s on everything
just to make money.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.162
What are you doing?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.932
I want everyone to know
who's helping them
in their time of need,

13:53.934 --> 13:56.034
a human being.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.702
Supergirl lulls us
into complacency.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.204
She fools us
into thinking she'll save us

13:59.206 --> 14:01.739
and renders us
incapable of saving ourselves.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.309
Like heroin,
or the welfare state.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.444
-That's cynical.
-It's realistic.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.980
If anything, Supergirl should
be thanking me
for what I'm not saying.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.883
-Which is what?
-She lost her powers.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.685
Explains why
she's nowhere to be found.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.820
I'm guessing she blew out
her photovoltaic capabilities

14:15.822 --> 14:17.755
fighting that
military android.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.724
She's a dead battery now.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.593
You can't be sure of that.

14:21.595 --> 14:24.262
I've studied Superman.
It takes him roughly
48 hours to recharge.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.864
We're way past that.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.599
If Supergirl hasn't gotten
her powers back by now,

14:27.601 --> 14:29.434
there's a good chance
she never will.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.869
And that means

14:30.871 --> 14:33.771
-we're on our own.
-Woman: (Sobbing) Help!

14:33.773 --> 14:35.840
Please! My dad
needs help over there!

14:39.012 --> 14:41.946
We can't leave.
Director henshaw
ordered us to stay here.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.882
We don't even know
if he's still alive, Donovan.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.617
These people
are relying on us.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.585
We're going. All right.

14:47.587 --> 14:51.589
Do not open this door until
you get an all clear from me.
And only me.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.894
Mind lowering that weapon?

14:58.665 --> 15:01.165
What happened?
We lost visuals.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.102
That was interference from
jemm's psychic powers.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.536
He ambushed us.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.105
(Gun cocking)

15:07.107 --> 15:08.706
Tsung and Reynolds,

15:09.242 --> 15:10.608
they're gone.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.678
I'm loaded.
I'm ready to go.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.713
You can't.
Only one disrupter left.

15:15.715 --> 15:16.915
Jemm destroyed the others.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.583
Donovan, get back
to your post.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.151
Look, I need you to do
what I say when I say it,

15:20.153 --> 15:23.187
because our situation
just got a whole lot worse.

15:23.189 --> 15:26.724
I found burn marks
on Reynolds' skull.
They're from a psychic scan.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.793
Jemm read his mind
and now knows everything
that Reynolds did.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.595
Reynolds was head of security.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.997
Which means jemm knows
how to open every cell
in this prison.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.333
He could use the combined
powers of the inmates to break
though the shield doors.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.068
I'll cover the cell block.
But I can't have you
getting in my way.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.870
So, I'm ordering you
to stay here.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.073
Alex, you got to trust me.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.651
Woman:
Over here. Help.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.219
Please, please,
he's right here.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.223
(Crying) No.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.794
He's got
a tension pneumothorax.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.529
-You're a doctor?
-Did med school in a year.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.863
He needs
to get to the hospital.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.565
I called 911, but they
haven't come yet.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.967
Paramedics are swamped.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.703
I once saw a clip
of Supergirl in the news.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.538
She flew someone over there
to the hospital.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.974
Unless you know where she is,
we're your dad's only hope.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.114
-Damn it. It's a venous bleed.
-What?

16:23.116 --> 16:25.116
He must've lacerated
another vessel.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.285
So we find...
We find the vessel,
stop the bleeding, right?

16:27.287 --> 16:30.455
He's got 100,000
miles of vessels. We'll never
find the right one.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.423
Unless you have
an X-ray machine.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.158
Woman: (Crying)
Please. Please!

16:34.160 --> 16:36.594
He's exsanguinating
into his chest.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.597
He'll bleed out,
and go into shock
and die in a few minutes.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.237
No. No.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.006
Please do something. No.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.141
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

16:50.143 --> 16:53.978
(Straining) Please. Please.
Come on, come on. Come on!

16:56.516 --> 16:57.815
Kara.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.218
-(Groans) No. No, no, no.
-Kara, look.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.287
-(Breathing heavily)
-Kara. Please stop.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.634
Just...

17:16.636 --> 17:18.469
Do something! Come on!

17:18.471 --> 17:20.038
This can't be it!

17:20.040 --> 17:21.472
-We can't save him.
-No!

17:21.474 --> 17:23.007
-Sorry.
-No.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.043
-Damn it!
-Woman: (Sobbing) No, no, no.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.178
James:
It's okay, it's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.247
It's only a matter of time
before jemm finds us in here.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.215
You don't think
director henshaw
will come through for us?

17:31.217 --> 17:33.885
I don't think relying on him
is in our best interest.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.453
-You don't trust him?
-This isn't the first time

17:35.455 --> 17:38.723
that he's been
the sole survivor
of a botched operation.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.727
And the details of that story
were just as sketchy
as this one.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.196
-So what do we do?
-We go out there.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.800
But we don't have
any neural inhibitors left
to protect us from jemm.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.102
I'm in.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.504
Okay.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.540
This is why
I'm not nice to people.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.642
One compliment,
and now you're coasting.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.177
What is taking you so long?

17:59.179 --> 18:01.345
(Stammering)
Hey, I'm an it guy, you know.

18:01.347 --> 18:04.549
I just... the last time
i hooked up a live feed was

18:04.551 --> 18:06.684
for the high school av club,
okay?

18:06.686 --> 18:08.653
Well, the last time
i did a live broadcast

18:08.655 --> 18:10.555
was to end
my award-winning talk show.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.124
So, you and i
are both returning
to our roots.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.229
I broke something.
I'm so sorry, Ms. Grant.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.431
(Stutters)
This isn't gonna work. I...

18:20.433 --> 18:24.635
Normally, I would fire you
and replace you instantly,
but we're short-staffed.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.638
So instead I will inspire you.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.976
Even I was like you once.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.880
Before all of this,
i was, well...

18:35.882 --> 18:39.117
I was a, um,
sought-after media pundit

18:39.119 --> 18:40.885
and a celebrated
magazine editor.

18:40.887 --> 18:44.388
-But...
-That's like me because...

18:44.390 --> 18:46.357
Because before that,

18:46.359 --> 18:50.528
I was a humble wannabe
journalist with the heart
of a real journalist.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.096
Now, there are

18:52.098 --> 18:53.931
-real stories out there...
-Um, that's not gonna help.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.200
...and they're not
getting reported
because Maxwell lord is

18:56.202 --> 18:59.003
sucking up all the air
with his negativity.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.572
And Supergirl's not here
to lift everyone's spirits.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.674
So I will.

19:03.676 --> 19:07.111
And you, humble it guy,
will rise to the occasion
and help me save this city.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.181
Oh, oh, I did it! I did it!

19:11.017 --> 19:12.550
Oh.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.252
You see, wyck?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.953
That's the story.

19:15.955 --> 19:19.824
Ordinary people like you,
used to doing
mundane and small things,

19:19.826 --> 19:21.425
finding themselves

19:21.427 --> 19:24.795
in the midst of a crisis
doing something extraordinary.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.231
Heroes.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.935
Now, go find someone
to do my makeup.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.570
-(Taps table)
-Chop, chop.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.172
For the... got it. Yeah, okay.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.346
James: Kara.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.824
I couldn't save him.
(Sniffles)

19:57.330 --> 20:00.431
-You did everything
that you could.
-As Kara danvers.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.769
But Supergirl
could've done more.

20:07.073 --> 20:11.142
These past few weeks have been
the best of my life.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.810
I was starting
to make a difference.

20:12.812 --> 20:16.747
I was helping people
the way that
I've always wanted.

20:16.749 --> 20:20.017
Do you know what that's like,
to just have that ripped away?

20:20.019 --> 20:23.621
Can't say that I do.
But I... I do know

20:23.623 --> 20:26.457
that you're the same girl
that you were before.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.727
Losing your powers
has not changed that.

20:29.729 --> 20:33.497
It's changed everything.
I... I feel...

20:34.968 --> 20:36.867
I feel so helpless.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.502
What you're feeling is human.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.538
What if Max lord...
What if what he said
was right?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.540
What if mine never come back?

20:42.542 --> 20:45.576
And what kind of a hero
does that make me
without them?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.245
(Scoffs)

20:47.247 --> 20:49.247
I couldn't even save one man.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.850
No hero can save everyone.
Not even Superman.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.821
But a real hero
never stops trying.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.924
(Glass shattering)

21:02.328 --> 21:04.829
Hey, hey. What? No, no.
Hey! What are you doing?

21:04.831 --> 21:06.197
Like you said,
i can't stop trying.

21:06.199 --> 21:08.099
Yes, when you get
your powers back.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.467
But that's a mob scene.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.102
They could have guns.
You could get shot.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.470
I can't do nothing.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.872
You being killed
is not gonna help anybody.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.807
I have to.

21:16.809 --> 21:20.211
Kara, the bullets are not
gonna bounce
off of you this time.

21:20.213 --> 21:22.280
-They don't know that.
-Kara!

21:26.452 --> 21:27.818
(Water dripping)

21:28.621 --> 21:30.054
Alex: Clear.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.270
(Beeping)

21:46.272 --> 21:48.005
This neural inhibitor
is still functional.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.874
Henshaw said they were
destroyed in the fight.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.175
He lied.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.077
Check the one on Reynolds.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.084
This one's working, too.

22:01.254 --> 22:02.787
Oh, man,
this isn't good, is it?

22:02.789 --> 22:04.422
No. No, it's not.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.023
(Explosion)

22:06.025 --> 22:08.192
Put that inhibitor on, now.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.898
Jemm's voice: Donovan!

22:13.900 --> 22:15.833
Alex: We've got to move, now.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.902
Donovan, you still with me?

22:17.904 --> 22:19.470
Donovan, you still with me?

22:27.480 --> 22:28.612
He's in my head.

22:32.251 --> 22:34.151
(Straining)
I'm not sure how long

22:35.321 --> 22:37.521
I can fight him.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.092
Go!

22:41.828 --> 22:43.227
Go!

22:46.132 --> 22:47.565
Get behind the counter!

22:47.567 --> 22:48.699
Don't do this to my store!

22:48.701 --> 22:50.267
Shut up!
Don't make me shoot you.

22:50.269 --> 22:51.969
-No, no, no.
-I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.571
That's not
going to work on me.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.005
Stay back.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.374
Don't come any closer.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.043
You don't want
to hurt these people.

23:00.113 --> 23:01.746
Cat: People of national city.

23:01.748 --> 23:04.849
This is cat Grant,
coming to you
from catco Plaza.

23:04.851 --> 23:09.253
We've just, minutes ago,
restarted our
broadcasting capabilities.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.922
(Sighs)

23:14.594 --> 23:16.093
Look.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.796
We're all suffering through
a major disaster.

23:18.798 --> 23:22.400
Now, you could react
to this crisis by being petty

23:22.402 --> 23:26.303
and divisive or preying
on other people's fears.

23:26.305 --> 23:30.040
And after all, it is human
to be selfish.

23:30.042 --> 23:34.545
But isn't it also human
to face our weaknesses
and rise above them?

23:34.547 --> 23:37.114
Act like a superhero,
even if you aren't one?

23:37.116 --> 23:38.983
Kara: I know you're scared.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.018
We all are.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.988
You want to save yourself,
your family.

23:45.458 --> 23:48.659
But don't you see that we are
all in this together?

23:48.661 --> 23:52.062
It's true. Supergirl has
not been located yet.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.731
But her spirit

23:53.733 --> 23:57.668
stays with us, her insistence
on seeing the best in people,

23:57.670 --> 24:00.037
a call for us to heed
our better angels.

24:00.039 --> 24:04.074
There's about a dozen ways
that I could stop
you right now.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.643
But I don't think I have to.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.077
Supergirl has faith in us.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.046
Because this is not you.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.383
It isn't any of you.

24:12.385 --> 24:16.587
So let's have
a little faith in her.

24:16.589 --> 24:20.291
Supergirl will return
when we need her most.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.660
Until then,
we need to help each other.

24:22.662 --> 24:25.463
I believe that we are
better than this.

24:25.465 --> 24:29.333
Call us,
share your stories of heroism.

24:29.335 --> 24:32.236
Let's show the world
what we're really made of.

24:32.238 --> 24:35.739
And, no, we can't do
what Supergirl does, but...

24:35.741 --> 24:37.074
We choose who we want to be.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.176
We must choose
to do what we can.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.511
Kara: <i> And I know</i>

24:40.513 --> 24:42.580
you're gonna choose
to be a better man.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.363
(Camera clicking)

25:35.868 --> 25:37.601
(Muffled scream)

25:43.242 --> 25:45.142
What are you doing here?

25:45.144 --> 25:46.844
Donovan and i
were looking for you.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.045
Where is he now?

25:48.047 --> 25:49.980
(Panting)

25:49.982 --> 25:52.750
You lost him.
Damn it, that's why I told you
to stay with the others!

25:52.752 --> 25:55.486
You also said
that the inhibitors
were destroyed.

25:55.488 --> 25:57.888
-You lied to me.
-Because I didn't
want you doing something

25:57.890 --> 25:59.523
stupid like this!

25:59.525 --> 26:02.159
Donovan: <i> Agent danvers,</i>
<i> come in!</i>

26:02.161 --> 26:04.328
Copy, Donovan.
What's your status?

26:04.330 --> 26:06.764
Donovan: <i> I'm okay. But I'm</i>
<i> out here all on my own.</i>
<i> Where the hell are you?</i>

26:06.766 --> 26:08.032
I thought I'd lost you.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.567
Not getting rid of me
that easy.

26:09.569 --> 26:12.403
-All right.
Rendezvous with me...
-Don't.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.772
Don't.
It's not Donovan anymore.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.307
Jemm, I know it's you.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.278
(In jemm's voice)
You've only delayed
the inevitable.

26:22.548 --> 26:23.714
(Thud)

26:27.153 --> 26:31.088
I will free the prisoners
and break through
to the surface.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.856
There's no escape for you.

26:36.228 --> 26:39.430
We have to move
to a secure location
before jemm gets down here.

26:40.333 --> 26:41.699
Back away from the door.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.068
Drop your weapon.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.603
-Alex.
-Now!

26:49.008 --> 26:50.608
(Sighs)

26:55.781 --> 26:57.247
Alex, what are you doing?

26:57.249 --> 26:58.882
I am not the enemy.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.818
So, is that why
you didn't tell me
about my father?

27:00.820 --> 27:02.553
I found out he was deo.

27:02.555 --> 27:06.056
And that you blackmailed him
to serve under you.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.758
Your father believed in me.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.294
-He was a great man...
-You don't get
to talk about him!

27:15.468 --> 27:17.234
You chain yourself.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.402
-Alex, come on...
-To those bars there.

27:18.404 --> 27:19.770
-Come on.
-Now!

27:25.344 --> 27:27.911
Jemm, this is agent danvers.

27:27.913 --> 27:31.782
I know you want those
blast doors open.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.051
You don't need to release
the prisoners to do that.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.853
All you need is me.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.521
I have the access code.

27:37.523 --> 27:40.991
I'll be waiting for you
in the control room.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.761
Because one way or another,

27:43.763 --> 27:45.362
this ends now.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.632
Alex! Alex!

27:49.869 --> 27:53.804
Kara: Oh, man.
That was better than flying.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.839
That was... that was better
than catching a plane.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.008
You know what,
that was better than the time

27:58.010 --> 28:00.644
I stopped the hold-up
at the pizzeria and the owner
gave me 12 pizzas.

28:00.646 --> 28:02.780
-That was good pizza.
-Uh, yes.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.917
You know, I've seen so many
pictures of myself recently,

28:06.919 --> 28:10.688
I'm kind of on a me overload.
But this one feels different.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.991
Well, they say
the best photographs

28:13.993 --> 28:16.460
express how you feel
about what
you're photographing.

28:17.730 --> 28:18.829
And I know you.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.733
What's the first picture
you ever took?

28:22.735 --> 28:23.901
My dad.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.839
He gave me a camera

28:28.841 --> 28:31.175
right before
he left for the Gulf war.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.711
It was better
than what my family
could afford,

28:33.713 --> 28:35.979
but, uh, still
wasn't a very good one.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.519
And then he didn't come home.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.189
(Inhales deeply)

28:45.191 --> 28:48.325
And I just... (Chuckling)
I never put that camera down.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.466
You look like him.

29:00.139 --> 29:01.605
Yeah.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.542
When you take
a picture of someone,

29:07.747 --> 29:09.146
it's permanent.

29:09.148 --> 29:12.416
And you've captured the truth
of them in that moment,

29:12.418 --> 29:15.052
and that you can keep forever.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.791
And... (Clears throat)
The truth of this moment

29:25.531 --> 29:28.031
is that you don't
even need powers

29:28.968 --> 29:30.400
to be a hero.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.372
I love it.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.712
(Clicks tongue)

29:48.854 --> 29:50.053
(Door opening)

29:53.492 --> 29:56.393
I... I accessed the deo file
on Superman...

29:56.395 --> 29:59.596
(Stammering) And i
ran a differential

29:59.598 --> 30:03.734
analysis, uh, on the rates
at which you might
metabolize solar radiation.

30:03.736 --> 30:05.669
-Winn...
-You know,
the long and short of it

30:05.671 --> 30:07.871
is basically that you might
get your powers back

30:07.873 --> 30:09.406
if, um...

30:09.408 --> 30:14.478
If they are reignited
by a Kryptonian version
of extreme adrenaline.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.648
-Just...
-(Thud)

30:20.452 --> 30:22.019
Winn. Stop.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.954
I know what you think
you saw, but...

30:23.956 --> 30:26.423
-I didn't...
I didn't see anything.
-Okay.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.192
You know he has
a girlfriend, right?

30:28.194 --> 30:30.093
-What?
-Lucy is coming back.

30:30.095 --> 30:32.696
Okay, and so are your powers.
You're never gonna have

30:32.698 --> 30:35.098
the normal boy-meets-girl.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.669
(Stammering)
Okay, the superhero
never gets the guy.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.471
Wow.

30:41.473 --> 30:46.009
You've really given thought
to my romantic future,
or lack of it.

30:46.879 --> 30:48.579
Look, hey.

30:48.581 --> 30:51.481
I'm sorry, but after today,
you... (Sighs)

30:51.483 --> 30:56.220
You're not... you're not
gonna be human anymore.
You're gonna have your powers.

30:56.222 --> 30:59.723
You... you live on, like,
a different level
than the rest of us.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.925
(Rumbling)

31:05.898 --> 31:08.866
-Everybody okay?
-Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.834
(Explosion)

31:10.836 --> 31:12.836
That wasn't an aftershock,
that was an explosion.

31:12.838 --> 31:15.405
-It's got to be the gas line.
-I'll check the stairs.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.140
Please let nobody be up there.

31:17.142 --> 31:18.742
-Man: <i> Yeah. Hello.</i>
-Of course
there's someone up there.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.611
Hi, hi, yes. We're just
a few floors below you.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.045
Help is on the way.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.147
(Whispering) Um, I just lied
to an entire floor

31:24.149 --> 31:25.883
of trapped people
in a burning building,

31:25.885 --> 31:27.918
-what's our next move?
-The stairwell's blocked
going up.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.420
We have to at least
get everyone on this
floor downstairs.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.122
So, what about
the people upstairs?

31:32.124 --> 31:33.690
Man on phone:
<i> ...The floor above you.</i>
<i> We can't get out, okay?</i>

31:33.692 --> 31:35.158
The elevator shaft.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.879
Show yourself.

31:57.049 --> 32:01.251
Let us see if you die
with more honor

32:01.253 --> 32:03.186
than your fallen friends.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.195
(Beeps)

32:31.350 --> 32:35.552
It will take more than that
to kill me, human.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.892
(Shouting)

32:44.029 --> 32:45.562
(Groans)

32:58.043 --> 32:59.242
(Grunting)

33:04.483 --> 33:06.083
(Neck cracking)

33:09.989 --> 33:11.254
(Panting)

33:18.063 --> 33:19.763
I told you, Alex.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.299
I'm not the enemy.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.474
Yeah, yeah.
Go to the elevator.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.976
-(Groans) I...
-I got it.

33:32.978 --> 33:34.544
(Struggling)

33:36.615 --> 33:38.782
-Where are they?
-Winn: Here, here.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.852
Oh... oh, god.
Why'd I do that?

33:41.854 --> 33:44.287
Uh, problem. They can't get
their elevator door open.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.823
All right, I'm gonna have
to climb up and open it
from the other side.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.759
James, no,
we are 23 floors up.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.627
I didn't say
i was excited about it, okay?

33:50.629 --> 33:53.096
-James.
-Be right back. I promise.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.299
-Tell them I'm coming.
-He's coming.

33:56.301 --> 33:57.734
(James grunting)

34:06.545 --> 34:07.911
Get us out!

34:16.422 --> 34:18.055
(Straining)

34:19.158 --> 34:22.292
-(Woman screaming)
-James: Okay. Okay.

34:22.294 --> 34:26.063
Grab the ladder.
Here you go. Watch your step.
Come on. Come on.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.331
Hug the wall.
Anybody else here?

34:28.333 --> 34:30.400
Kara: Careful.
Winn: Here we go. Here we go.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.602
Here we go. You're here.
You're here.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.337
I got you. (Grunts)

34:35.507 --> 34:37.074
Come on.

34:37.076 --> 34:38.942
(Rumbling)

34:40.479 --> 34:41.912
James!

34:45.717 --> 34:47.150
(Grunting)

34:48.253 --> 34:49.719
James!

34:51.356 --> 34:54.825
Go! Go get help! Hurry! Go on!
Come on!

34:54.827 --> 34:57.060
Jeez! I thought I panicked
under pressure.

35:02.835 --> 35:05.402
James! Reach for the ladder!

35:05.404 --> 35:06.970
(Grunting loudly)

35:10.042 --> 35:11.108
Reach!

35:27.659 --> 35:29.359
(James screaming)

35:36.335 --> 35:37.901
(Chuckles nervously)

35:37.903 --> 35:40.270
(Breathing heavily) You almost
gave me a heart attack.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.006
Well, I guess
that's what you needed.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.508
There's a city out there
that really needs you.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.876
Go get 'em, Supergirl.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.251
(Screaming)

35:55.554 --> 35:57.020
(Kids crying and screaming)

36:04.563 --> 36:06.062
(Kids cheering)

36:15.374 --> 36:16.806
(Blows)

36:19.778 --> 36:22.179
(Crowd applauding)

36:31.356 --> 36:34.024
Kara, it's me.

36:34.026 --> 36:37.194
I see that you're busy.
So, that's good.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.896
Uh, I just want
to let you know that
we're all okay here.

36:41.133 --> 36:42.465
We'll talk soon.

36:55.614 --> 36:59.516
You're wondering
how I got out of a pair
of locked handcuffs.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.184
For starters.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.753
There's only one other
living person who knows
the truth.

37:03.755 --> 37:06.356
You sure
you want to hear this?

37:06.358 --> 37:09.392
You can't share this
with anyone. Not even Kara.
Can you do that?

37:09.394 --> 37:11.962
You're the one who taught me
to keep secrets from her.

37:15.601 --> 37:18.969
I am not Hank henshaw.

37:20.239 --> 37:21.738
He died

37:21.740 --> 37:23.506
the same night as your father.

37:25.177 --> 37:28.511
The deo had been pursuing
an alien for months.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.415
Not one of the fort rozz
prisoners,

37:34.086 --> 37:37.954
but an innocent one
stranded on this planet.

37:37.956 --> 37:43.460
With the help of your father,
the deo tracked the alien
to a remote location in Peru.

37:44.997 --> 37:47.330
Henshaw led the squadron
sent to

37:48.533 --> 37:50.200
-terminate him.
-My father would never

37:50.202 --> 37:51.901
have been
part of a mission like that.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.236
You're right.

37:53.238 --> 37:57.274
Jeremiah danvers
was a good man.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.709
He realized
the alien they were hunting

37:59.711 --> 38:01.311
wasn't a threat.

38:03.382 --> 38:06.916
He was a refugee,
like your sister.

38:08.153 --> 38:10.887
Sole survivor of a lost world.

38:12.291 --> 38:16.259
Your father tried to
stop the mission, but henshaw

38:17.763 --> 38:20.330
was obsessed.

38:20.332 --> 38:24.601
He'd finally trapped the alien
he'd been hunting for so long.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.874
So, Jeremiah

38:32.844 --> 38:34.477
made the ultimate sacrifice.

38:37.849 --> 38:41.318
He gave his life
to save that alien.

38:49.061 --> 38:50.927
Your father died a hero.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.264
That alien...

38:58.303 --> 38:59.469
Is that you?

39:04.076 --> 39:06.109
But how are you him?

39:08.947 --> 39:11.348
I am a shape shifter.

39:11.350 --> 39:16.986
When Hank henshaw died,
i assumed his identity
to reform the deo.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.489
But I also made
your father a promise,

39:21.493 --> 39:24.561
that I would take care
of his daughter.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.831
I recruited you

39:27.833 --> 39:30.433
so that I would honor
that promise

39:30.435 --> 39:32.068
and protect you

39:32.838 --> 39:35.138
as if you were my own child.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.273
If you're not Hank henshaw,

39:39.611 --> 39:41.177
who are you?

39:46.585 --> 39:49.519
I am the sole survivor
of my planet.

39:50.756 --> 39:53.089
The last son of Mars.

40:01.333 --> 40:02.999
My name

40:03.935 --> 40:06.002
is j'onn j'onzz.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.844
-Winn.
-Nice job today.

40:14.846 --> 40:18.615
Hey, you want to come over
and, uh, help me eat
all the food in my fridge

40:18.617 --> 40:20.583
before it spoils?
Power's still out.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.952
I'm not that hungry.
But, uh, you know, thanks.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.421
Please.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.857
(Sighs)

40:27.859 --> 40:31.227
I know you're disappointed
in me with James,
and I'm sorry.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.430
Supergirl should be
better than that.

40:33.432 --> 40:36.199
I'm never disappointed
in Supergirl.

40:36.201 --> 40:38.168
I was disappointed in you.

41:31.289 --> 41:34.057
I heard your
amazing broadcast today.

41:35.193 --> 41:38.228
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the compliment.

41:38.230 --> 41:40.230
Now, where the hell were you?

41:40.232 --> 41:43.366
How could you up and leave
in the middle of the worst
disaster in decades?

41:43.368 --> 41:48.137
-I didn't mean to scare you.
-Oh, no. You didn't scare me.

41:48.139 --> 41:51.207
But regular people,
they're starting
to depend on you.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.610
It's easy for them
to feel abandoned.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.545
You have to understand

41:55.547 --> 42:01.384
that most people out there
spend most of their lives
feeling isolated and alone.

42:01.386 --> 42:03.186
And when a tragedy strikes,

42:03.188 --> 42:06.523
they look to their heroes.
Not only for rescue,
but for solace

42:06.525 --> 42:10.159
-and consistency.
-That's why I'm glad
they had you.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.363
You gave them hope today.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.633
I know that
you inspired them,

42:16.635 --> 42:19.402
because you inspired me.

42:37.822 --> 42:39.455
(Supergirl grunts)

42:46.131 --> 42:47.597
(Panting)

42:47.599 --> 42:48.698
Who are you?

42:50.969 --> 42:53.770
-They're with me.
-Astra.

42:53.772 --> 42:56.172
Astra: My dear niece.

42:56.174 --> 42:58.641
Did you really think
this was over?
