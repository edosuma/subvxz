- Rachel!
- OWEN: Rachel. Rachel, can you hear me?

00:09.109 --> 00:11.737
I can't be alone again.

00:11.811 --> 00:15.008
You're not gonna be.
You're coming home with me.

00:20.787 --> 00:24.188
Lindsey Evelyn Strauss,
will you marry me?

00:26.793 --> 00:30.388
Go. Carrie, get out
of this bathroom right now.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.330
I have been through
a lot with you, Nathan,

00:33.400 --> 00:35.129
I've been through better and worse,
in sickness and health,

00:35.201 --> 00:36.691
but I will not do infidelity.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.238
It wasn't like that, okay? I wasn't into her.

00:39.305 --> 00:40.533
You call kissing Carrie and watching her

00:40.607 --> 00:42.040
swim naked not being into her?

00:42.108 --> 00:43.166
I didn't kiss her.

00:43.243 --> 00:44.574
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

00:44.644 --> 00:47.875
- I can't take it anymore.
- Don't you dare turn this around on me.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.618
- Jamie! Jamie!
- Jamie!

00:56.456 --> 00:57.514
Oh, God! Please!

00:57.590 --> 00:58.682
No, you stay away from us!

00:58.758 --> 00:59.918
This marriage is over!

00:59.993 --> 01:02.052
- Haley...
- Oh, please, God.

01:03.663 --> 01:05.563
I want a divorce.

Morning.

01:40.333 --> 01:43.302
- Poor Nathan.
- Yeah, I know.

01:43.369 --> 01:46.668
If I'd have known he'd been here a week,
then I'd have cleared out my mom's room.

01:46.739 --> 01:48.570
Have they even
seen each other this week?

01:48.641 --> 01:50.871
Oh, no. I don't even think they've spoken.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.674
Right. The last thing
I want Haley worrying about is

01:53.746 --> 01:56.943
throwing a bachelorette party
when her marriage is struggling.

01:57.016 --> 01:58.278
You know, Skills could do it.

01:58.351 --> 02:01.252
I mean, he was so excited about my
bachelor party, he took the week off.

02:01.321 --> 02:04.779
- Oh, that worries me.
- Oh, yeah, me, too.

02:06.493 --> 02:12.523
You know, if a guy like me just happened
to have his party in the same place

02:12.599 --> 02:15.625
a girl like you happened
to have her party...

02:15.702 --> 02:18.694
Nathan and Haley would have to talk.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.866
Nice, but they'll never go for it.

02:22.942 --> 02:26.139
Well, they will if they...

02:26.212 --> 02:27.679
Don't know about it.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.716
Oh, you're bad.

02:31.584 --> 02:35.782
- You wanna be bad with me?
- You know I do.

02:38.358 --> 02:41.486
- Hey, sleepy, what's up?
- I saw Grandpa.

02:42.061 --> 02:45.758
- When?
- Last night, in my dream.

02:47.300 --> 02:53.034
I'm sorry, baby. We will do a double check
before you go to bed tonight, okay?

02:53.139 --> 02:57.542
Look, I made it with a smiley face.
That's how you like it, right?

02:58.912 --> 03:04.350
- When's Daddy coming home?
- I'm sorry, sweetie, we talked about this.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.410
Probably not for a while.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.353
<i>Bodiless and free</i>

03:12.625 --> 03:16.721
<i>So those tiny little hands</i>

03:17.330 --> 03:19.389
And so, what were you thinking
about doing for your party?

03:19.465 --> 03:22.229
'Cause I was thinking it would be
really fun to go old school,

03:22.302 --> 03:24.827
like, Jell-O shots and '80s music.

03:24.904 --> 03:28.738
Actually, if it's okay with you,
I was thinking we'd do something low key.

03:28.808 --> 03:32.005
- All right.
- Just the girls.

03:32.078 --> 03:35.309
Come on, man, just the guys.
And Lindsey talked to Haley,

03:35.381 --> 03:36.712
and she said she's gonna
clear out of the house.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.980
Really? All right, I'll be there.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.079
Thanks, man.
I know you got a lot going on.

03:43.156 --> 03:47.422
I got a lot going on?
Lucas, I'm living on your couch.

03:48.995 --> 03:52.863
- I meant on your mind.
- Just the guys, right?

03:53.466 --> 03:55.195
And Jamie.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.464
Joint party? Man, your parents
are messing up everything.

04:01.641 --> 04:05.099
Well, I guess I got to say good-bye
to the champagne hot tub.

04:05.645 --> 04:07.613
Now what I'm gonna do?

04:07.680 --> 04:10.171
I went to a great party last weekend.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.241
Yeah? What'd they have?

04:13.653 --> 04:19.113
Cotton candy, Moonbounce, Wacky String.
Oh, and donkey rides.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.284
Yeah? I had a donkey on my list, too.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.063
All right, Luke. Let me have it.

04:32.138 --> 04:34.231
- I deserve it.
- Why?

04:34.307 --> 04:36.502
Come on. Lindsey didn't
tell you about the library?

04:36.576 --> 04:38.703
Yeah, she told me Tim rescued you.
But you got to admit

04:38.778 --> 04:40.075
that story seems a little far-fetched.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.944
If you girls didn't want to come
watch my team play, just say so.

04:43.016 --> 04:47.043
Okay, come on. She didn't say anything
about how mean I was to her?

04:47.687 --> 04:50.485
No. Were you mean to her again?

04:52.392 --> 04:56.123
- She's really great, Luke.
- I know.

04:57.430 --> 05:00.126
But it means a lot to hear you say that.

05:03.036 --> 05:07.268
<i>There's no doubt about us</i>

05:09.008 --> 05:11.568
You and Owen didn't hook up
in New York?

05:11.644 --> 05:15.512
Let's just say things are really good.
What about you and Mouth?

05:15.581 --> 05:19.415
- How's that going?
- Let's just say things are really good.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.077
He's been so sweet.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.555
Every day he delivers a treat,
and just before he leaves, a kiss.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.491
- It's the best part of my day.
- I want a treat every day.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.654
- Two treats, if you count the kiss.
- Oh.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.222
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.666
I got you a pumpernickel bagel
and a surprise for you.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.465
Mocha double latte, extra foam.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.199
I love you.

05:41.874 --> 05:44.274
And I have a bit of a surprise for you.

05:45.378 --> 05:48.711
- Rachel's back.
- Rachel, Rachel?

05:49.048 --> 05:52.814
Owen and I found her in New York.
She overdosed in my apartment.

05:52.885 --> 05:55.217
She's been laying low at the house
for about a week.

05:55.288 --> 05:59.622
- Is she okay?
- She seems okay today, but I don't know.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.820
A visit from you
would probably really do her good.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.658
Yeah. Okay.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.197
Bye, Millie.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.303
I didn't get my kiss.

- you can keep it.
- Just open it.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.949
Does my store look like
a drug front to you?

07:01.020 --> 07:02.885
It's the startup money
you lent me for my label.

07:02.955 --> 07:04.616
I just got paid for Mia's deal.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.157

07:06.225 --> 07:07.658
No, but cash is just more fun.

07:07.727 --> 07:11.754
- It's more dramatic.
- Peyton, this is way more money

07:11.831 --> 07:13.059
than I lent you.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.795
It's twice as much, actually.
It looks like you're a very smart investor.

07:16.869 --> 07:19.429
- Well.
- So, what's going on?

07:19.505 --> 07:21.564
Brooke? It's amazing.

07:26.679 --> 07:29.011
- Hey, Lindsey. Hi.
- Hi.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.649
You make a very beautiful bride.

07:33.152 --> 07:37.714
Thank you, Peyton.
And thank you, Brooke. It's perfect.

07:38.991 --> 07:43.758
- It is perfect.
- Oh, hey, so, Lucas and I decided

07:43.830 --> 07:47.231
to combine our bachelor-bachelorette
parties tonight at Haley's.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.030
Wow. Have Nathan and Haley even talked

07:50.102 --> 07:52.161
since Nate went all
Jude Law with the hot nanny?

07:52.238 --> 07:53.830
- Didn't we warn her?
- Yeah.

07:53.906 --> 07:57.808
- No, they're not speaking.
- Okay, so how...

07:59.011 --> 08:01.479
- We lied.
- Oh, that's good.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.913
Got to start somewhere, right?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.063
And Mommy, too?

08:24.136 --> 08:27.572
Yep. But, look, you can't tell

- You see the bar code for your next book?

08:57.203 --> 09:01.663
- I gotta give them something, Luke.
- I know. I know, I know, I know.

09:01.741 --> 09:04.505
Let me give it one more pass,
and then you got it, okay?

09:04.577 --> 09:05.805
Thank you.

09:07.346 --> 09:12.807
Oh, PDA in the mall is so seventh grade.
Owen, kiss me. They're doing it.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.150
- So is peer pressure.
- What's going on?

09:16.222 --> 09:19.020
Oh, nothing. Just killing some time
before my big meeting.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.051
O-M-G! Brooke? Lucas?

09:23.596 --> 09:26.793
R-A-V-E-N-S! Go, Ravens!

09:26.866 --> 09:30.233
- Hi, Bevin.
- What's up?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.931
- Nothing. We're just...
- Oh, I'm great, thanks.

09:33.005 --> 09:37.101
So, after I graduated four years ago,
I got a job, and I got married,

09:37.176 --> 09:42.170
and I had a little boy.
Oh. Isn't he cute? His name is Nathan.

09:45.551 --> 09:50.853
Wow, Lucas. You're marrying Brooke?
Huh. I always thought you'd marry Peyton.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.855
- No...
- So have you heard from Rachel?

10:00.733 --> 10:04.430
- It's a nice spot, huh?
- Yeah.

10:05.204 --> 10:06.933
How you feeling today?

10:08.774 --> 10:13.711
Honestly, I'm a little bit ashamed.
You and Brooke don't have to baby-sit me.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.907
Don't be too hard on yourself, okay?

10:19.118 --> 10:20.710
I know I can beat this.

10:22.488 --> 10:25.651
I just got so deep in it that
I forgot which way was up.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.488
The light is always up.

10:28.828 --> 10:31.956
When I first came back home,
I really didn't know what I wanted.

10:32.031 --> 10:37.196
And Brooke believed in me, and today
it felt really, really good to prove her right.

10:38.838 --> 10:43.400
- She believes in you, too, you know.
- I know, and I'm gonna make it up to her.

10:45.478 --> 10:49.107
- How's Rachel doing?
- Really well, actually.

10:49.582 --> 10:53.313
It's been hard on her,
you know, and so gross.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.753
But I think she's strong enough
to stay sober. I really do.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.914
I hope so, Brooke.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.754
You know, I know I was a little
opinionated about how you fired Rachel,

11:00.826 --> 11:03.761
but I think I was
just projecting, you know?

11:04.497 --> 11:07.057
It's really great
you're trying to help her now.

11:07.133 --> 11:12.036
Well, I'm not helping her 'cause I fired her.
I'm helping her 'cause she needs it.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.937
Oh. Hello, darling.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.474
Hi.

11:17.843 --> 11:18.832
I'm confused.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.812
Of course you are.
The meeting was moved forward.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.577
Not to worry, your input wasn't needed.

11:25.317 --> 11:28.252
- But this was my meeting.
- It was just business talk.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.811
Way over your head.
You wouldn't have understood.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.757
So where have you been
hiding yourself all week, anyway?

11:33.826 --> 11:37.762
I've been finishing a wedding dress
and handling some personal things.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.661
Well, good. You can get back to it.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.228
You're dismissed. Go play.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.532
It's what you do best.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.607
Babe, you shouldn't put up with that.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.201
I know she's your mom,

11:53.279 --> 11:55.474
but you can't be partners
with somebody that treats you like that.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.813
Okay, I thought you were working
on the whole opinionated thing.

12:05.591 --> 12:08.788
- Bye, Uncle Lucas.
- Hey, hey, hey. Where's my kiss?

12:08.928 --> 12:09.917
(JAMIE SPUTTERS)

12:09.995 --> 12:13.522
Oh, okay.
Careful what you ask for, I guess.

12:13.766 --> 12:15.290
- How's he doing?
- He's okay.

12:15.367 --> 12:18.564
You know, I think he's over hating me,
but I'm still the bad guy.

12:18.671 --> 12:22.232
Well, when he files for emancipation,
then you can worry.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.606
How are you and Lindsey doing?
You guys ready for the big day?

12:24.677 --> 12:27.942
One hurdle at a time.
You know, she wants my new pages first.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.345
I'm just not sure they're quite there.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.818
If you need an extra set of eyes,
I will be happy to help.

12:34.887 --> 12:38.482
- You would?
- Yes, of course. I was your first editor.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.186
If I don't like it, don't hate me.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.360
Okay, don't hate me, but you have
a date to the party tonight.

12:45.898 --> 12:49.129
One of Owen's friends is in town.
Supposedly, he's super-cute.

12:49.201 --> 12:52.728
He's coming out with us tonight.
I told him you were gonna be there.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.330
- A blind double date?
- Only half blind.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.435
Say yes, because it's
the Peyton I know and love,

12:58.511 --> 13:03.073
and because if you show up with a date,
you are gonna look classy and over it.

13:03.582 --> 13:07.848
Okay. I will go get ready,
but he better be cute.

13:11.824 --> 13:15.316
- I'd invite you...
- Yeah, but detox and parties don't mix.

13:15.394 --> 13:18.557
Yeah. But we're gonna come back early.
I promise.

13:20.599 --> 13:23.693
Look, I was talking to
Peyton today about how you

13:23.769 --> 13:27.398

25:12.978 --> 25:14.377

When I was a little girl, I sprayed the boys
I liked most with Wacky String.

25:19.684 --> 25:23.142

with and who's in a vulnerable state,

25:40.338 --> 25:41.737

25:43.275 --> 25:45.607
You're right. I can do that.

25:49.014 --> 25:51.539
So I built it up so much.
I told all these kids that my mom

25:51.616 --> 25:56.781
was gonna get me this cake with Rambo
on it, like, chest scars, flames, you know?

25:56.855 --> 26:00.518
My mom brings the cake out,
and instead of a picture of Rambo,

26:00.592 --> 26:04.892
it's, like, this dinky homemade cake.
No Rambo, just the words,

26:04.963 --> 26:08.421
"Rambo says happy birthday"
scribbled across the top.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.361

but if you have a better story...

26:14.506 --> 26:17.134

On the rare occasion that my mother
ever actually remembered my birthday,

26:19.778 --> 26:23.407
she'd just toss her gold card at me
and tell me to go buy something.

26:24.049 --> 26:25.573
She never really cared to get involved.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.244

she's running a halfway house, apparently.

You got to remember his size.

28:41.252 --> 28:44.278
You treat him like one of the guys,
but he's just a little boy.

28:49.227 --> 28:52.321

on how little that boy is.

28:52.397 --> 28:56.458
