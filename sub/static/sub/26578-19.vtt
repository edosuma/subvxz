WEBVTT

00:02.340 --> 00:05.399
The sun is out, so I won't
lose a toe to hypothermia.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.439
And I'm feeling less activity

00:07.440 --> 00:09.669
from my bodily parasites!

00:09.670 --> 00:11.459
Sitting there like a couple of lumps.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.559
It's a sin to watch TV
on such a nice day.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.368
It's "Boxcar Benji."

00:15.369 --> 00:17.079
That fake TV hobo?

00:17.080 --> 00:18.829
You should be out in the
fresh air, playing...

00:18.830 --> 00:20.419
with real hobos.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.080
Dodgers are on.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.899
I heard you that...

00:23.900 --> 00:26.219
Dad, you should be out in the
fresh air, playing real baseball.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.544
Funny you bring that up.

00:27.545 --> 00:29.160
When I played high school ball,

00:29.170 --> 00:31.460
there were a few scouts sniffing around.

00:31.470 --> 00:32.589
- I remember the...
- Oh, no, Dad's talking

00:32.590 --> 00:34.219
about the past again.

00:34.220 --> 00:35.540
Figured that would clear the room.

00:35.550 --> 00:37.299
I remember the first time

00:37.300 --> 00:39.500
I tried that particular
trick on the kids...

00:39.520 --> 00:40.879
I'm out of here.

00:43.290 --> 00:46.649
Just me and Don Sutton.

00:46.650 --> 00:49.402
- Give it back!
- I found a heretic in our midst.

00:49.403 --> 00:50.779
What, a Giants fan?

00:50.780 --> 00:53.320
William has been studying
this fake religion

00:53.330 --> 00:56.076
based on those dumb
science-fiction books he reads.

00:56.077 --> 00:58.661
Always reading. I'd hoped
that was just a phase.

00:58.662 --> 01:00.499
It's a science-based thought-system,

01:00.500 --> 01:02.079
much of it just as feasible

01:02.080 --> 01:03.360
as the stuff they teach in church.

01:03.370 --> 01:04.748
"Magor-eology"?

01:04.750 --> 01:06.860
By J. Eldon Gutierrez.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.959
They were handing those out

01:07.960 --> 01:09.289
in front of the vegetarian restaurant.

01:09.290 --> 01:10.899
That's where I'd go to look for suckers.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.579
Bunch of folks willing to spend 2 bucks

01:12.580 --> 01:13.879
on a bowl of grass soup.

01:13.880 --> 01:14.999
It's a philosophy

01:15.000 --> 01:16.540
the Magorian people have used to bring

01:16.550 --> 01:18.679
a trillion years of peace
to their quadrant.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.709
Wouldn't mind a little peace
in my quadrant right now.

01:20.710 --> 01:21.727
Give him his book back, Frank.

01:21.728 --> 01:23.440
Thank you.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.420
It's a slippery slope, Dad.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.733
First Magoreology, then he'll
be hanging out with Lutherans.

01:28.734 --> 01:30.329
Lutherans!

01:30.330 --> 01:31.460
Now that Frank is out of the room,

01:31.470 --> 01:33.300
I don't mind saying I agree with him.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.139
I don't like my kids looking
outside the Catholic Church.

01:35.140 --> 01:36.599
That's why we have all
the stained glass...

01:36.600 --> 01:37.614
so you can't see out.

01:37.615 --> 01:39.679
William's just got a
naturally curious mind.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.449
The other day, he was
asking me about Buddhism.

01:41.450 --> 01:42.779
And you told him?!

01:42.780 --> 01:45.205
Yeah, it's been around for a
while, Mom. It's out there.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.680
Oh, it's "out there," all right.

01:46.700 --> 01:49.250
A big, fat guy stuffing his
wisdom into fortune cookies.

01:49.255 --> 01:50.630
I think that's Confucianism.

01:50.631 --> 01:52.675
Damn right, it's confusing.

01:52.676 --> 01:54.379
All these new religions.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.469
Buddhism's actually
older than Catholicism.

01:56.470 --> 01:58.637
Yeah, well, I'm just hearing
about it, and I don't like it.

01:58.638 --> 01:59.639
Well, I think it's healthy

01:59.640 --> 02:01.259
that William's questioning his beliefs.

02:01.260 --> 02:02.449
Well, you questioned your beliefs

02:02.450 --> 02:04.119
right out of a cushy priest job.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.829
Our religion has a lot of
beautiful, profound ideas

02:06.830 --> 02:09.191
that only work if you don't
look at them too closely.

02:09.192 --> 02:10.860
Yeah, church isn't set up for brainiacs

02:10.880 --> 02:13.019
wringing their hands, trying
to pick things apart.

02:13.020 --> 02:14.219
That's what synagogues are for.

02:14.220 --> 02:15.679
- Mm-hmm.
- If you think your faith

02:15.680 --> 02:16.959
won't stand up to scrutiny,

02:16.960 --> 02:19.283
why is it so important for
your kids to follow it?

02:19.284 --> 02:20.319
Because it's right.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.328
Other religions feel the same way.

02:22.329 --> 02:23.409
Well, they're wrong.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.179
If you force William to
believe what you believe,

02:25.180 --> 02:26.700
you might just drive him away from it.

02:27.340 --> 02:28.699
Maybe he's right.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.879
Maybe we should back off William
and see how this plays out.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.400
That's the trouble with
smart kids... they're awful.

02:33.410 --> 02:34.639
The dumb ones are awful, too,

02:34.640 --> 02:35.842
but at least you can boss them around.

02:35.843 --> 02:37.386
Eddie, pick up your feet when you walk.

02:37.387 --> 02:38.389
Where have you guys been?

02:38.390 --> 02:39.559
We got up at 3:00 in the morning

02:39.560 --> 02:41.013
to get in line for Zeppelin tickets.

02:41.014 --> 02:42.599
Ooh, it's time for the air show again?

02:42.600 --> 02:45.039
I'm not surprised blimp
day's become a hot ticket.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.062
They're the gentle giants of the sky.

02:48.063 --> 02:49.565
They're talking about the band.

02:49.566 --> 02:51.160
Zeppelin's a band now?

02:51.170 --> 02:52.920
Your generation ruins everything.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.379
Hermits, stones, beetles...

02:55.380 --> 02:57.113
words used to mean something.

02:57.114 --> 02:59.319
Well, we didn't get the tickets

02:59.320 --> 03:01.340
because someone fell
asleep on their shift.

03:01.350 --> 03:04.075
The guy promised he'd wake me
up when the Ticketron opened.

03:04.076 --> 03:05.860
You mean the guy in line behind us

03:05.880 --> 03:07.840
who accused us of cutting
in front of him?

03:07.850 --> 03:09.209
Yeah... Doug.

03:13.672 --> 03:15.479
I am never speaking to Doug again.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.549
You're never seeing him again.

03:16.550 --> 03:17.709
How about at the concert?

03:17.710 --> 03:18.740
Doug'll be there.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.349
But we won't... because of you!

03:20.350 --> 03:21.359
Because of Doug.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.859
If we had to depend on
you two in the war,

03:22.860 --> 03:24.764
we'd all be speaking German right now.

03:24.765 --> 03:26.200
That would be really helpful.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.579
I cannot get through my
foreign language requirement.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.563
I'm surprised you're giving up so easy.

03:30.564 --> 03:32.023
You always seem to have a connection

03:32.024 --> 03:33.943
for concert tickets and fireworks.

03:33.944 --> 03:36.060
And a koala that one time.

03:36.070 --> 03:38.069
Ohh. Pat's best birthday yet.

03:38.070 --> 03:39.079
Yeah.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.980
I got Mousey and Ray-Ray
beating the streets,

03:40.990 --> 03:43.620
but so far, all they could
score me was "Ice Capades."

03:43.630 --> 03:45.412
But I might be able to set you
up for that air show, Dad.

03:45.413 --> 03:47.179
I'll take two for blimp day.

03:47.180 --> 03:49.707
And, uh, some more of those
hot dog vouchers. Hmm?

03:52.840 --> 03:54.739
Is this tie too flashy for Mass, hon?

03:54.740 --> 03:57.399
Huh. Didn't realize I was
married to Liberace.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.540
Wear the brown one.

03:58.550 --> 04:00.699
There you are... the
last place I checked.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.159
Why aren't you wearing pants?

04:02.160 --> 04:03.439
They wouldn't fit over my shoes,

04:03.440 --> 04:04.847
but that's not why I'm here.

04:04.848 --> 04:07.308
Don't feel bad, pal. I
blew it with my tie.

04:07.309 --> 04:09.560
William says he's not
going to church today.

04:09.561 --> 04:11.169
Nonsense. You tell him he's going.

04:11.170 --> 04:12.772
- And put your pants on.
- I mean,

04:12.773 --> 04:14.232
I can try again, but...

04:14.233 --> 04:15.567
Take your shoes off first.

04:15.568 --> 04:17.320
Ohh!

04:17.329 --> 04:19.444
So, now William doesn't want
to go to church at all.

04:19.445 --> 04:20.519
Well, I guess we clamp down

04:20.519 --> 04:22.489
before his doubts about
religion affect the other kids.

04:22.490 --> 04:23.499
We don't want them catching on.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.229
You mean we don't want
the others doubting it?

04:25.230 --> 04:26.244
Sure.

04:26.245 --> 04:29.329
Well, his problem is, he sits
in Mass thinking about stuff.

04:29.330 --> 04:31.260
We need to find him a distraction...

04:31.270 --> 04:33.079
like when the baby and Eddie get fussy,

04:33.080 --> 04:34.519
I give them my keys to play with.

04:34.520 --> 04:37.139
And Pat likes how the pew
vibrates under his butt

04:37.140 --> 04:38.590
when the organ plays a low note.

04:40.020 --> 04:41.959
What on God's green Earth?!

04:41.960 --> 04:44.053
Sounds like you're playing
Hell's national anthem.

04:44.054 --> 04:46.329
I'm just practicing
scales on my theremin.

04:46.330 --> 04:48.299
- Oh.
- I was hoping to skip Mass today

04:48.300 --> 04:49.726
to learn the theme from "Star Trek."

04:49.727 --> 04:51.749
I know how into music you are.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.840
Father Abdi says

04:52.850 --> 04:54.799
you're a once-in-a-generation
musical talent.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.640
Would you knock that off?

04:56.660 --> 04:59.019
Wait. You were talking
to Father Abdi about me?

04:59.020 --> 05:00.599
Just the other day,
when I was teaching him

05:00.600 --> 05:01.980
how Americans use stairs,

05:01.990 --> 05:04.699
he asked about you getting
involved with the boys' choir.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.059
- Our choir?
- Mm-hmm.

05:06.060 --> 05:08.529
Oh, and do you know why our
church calls it a choir?

05:08.530 --> 05:11.340
Because when they sing,
it's so terrible,

05:11.350 --> 05:12.949
you... cwy.

05:12.950 --> 05:14.779
Sure, Timmy made a bad joke,

05:14.780 --> 05:16.959
but even in the worst comedy,

05:16.960 --> 05:18.519
there's a germ of truth.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.819
Our choir stinks.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.749
That's all I wanted to communicate.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.300
I thank ye.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.419
Look, that's why Father Abdi needs you.

05:27.420 --> 05:29.724
He was hoping you'd
listen during Mass today

05:29.725 --> 05:31.619
and give suggestions.

05:31.620 --> 05:33.311
And they'll take them seriously?

05:33.312 --> 05:35.540
That's what the Catholic
Church is known for...

05:35.550 --> 05:37.565
always welcoming new ideas.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.419
♪ Holy God, we praise Thy Name ♪

05:46.420 --> 05:49.577
Tempo. Tempo! Come on, people!

05:49.578 --> 05:55.333
♪ Lord of all, we bow before Thee ♪

05:55.334 --> 05:57.335
Terrible. It's just appalling.

05:57.336 --> 05:59.379
Cut 'em some slack. Their
voices are changing.

05:59.380 --> 06:00.797
Not changing enough.

06:00.798 --> 06:02.423
Ohh!

06:02.424 --> 06:06.859
♪ Everlasting is Thy reign ♪

06:06.860 --> 06:10.429
Ooh! That hymn tickles my butt!

06:10.430 --> 06:12.160
I welcome you in Christ's name.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.379
Coming down the tracks
on this two-for-Tuesday,

06:14.380 --> 06:16.719
a double shot of Grand Funk Railroad.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.799
What's your finger doing,
besides putting undue stress

06:18.800 --> 06:19.816
on the rotary mechanism?

06:19.817 --> 06:22.269
KYWW has tickets to Led Zeppelin.

06:22.270 --> 06:23.400
You call in to win.

06:23.410 --> 06:26.531
But you have to say, "KYWW
plays all the hits."

06:26.532 --> 06:28.579
Now that I understand
it, I care even less.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.533
Hang up. I like to keep that line open.

06:30.534 --> 06:32.139
Dad, c'mon! You never get calls.

06:32.140 --> 06:34.499
I work in the defense industry,
so I must be reachable

06:34.500 --> 06:37.041
at all times in case of
a national emergency.

06:38.090 --> 06:39.919
What'd I tell you?

06:39.920 --> 06:41.419
Mike Cleary.

06:41.420 --> 06:43.040
Uh-huh.

06:43.050 --> 06:44.940
Uh-huh. Well, that's intriguing.

06:44.950 --> 06:46.540
You confirmed those
figures with the Colonel?

06:46.550 --> 06:48.300
And everybody up at HQ?

06:49.960 --> 06:52.200
Okay. I'll be there.

06:54.660 --> 06:57.688
Peggy, Kentucky Fried
Chicken has a meal deal...

06:57.689 --> 07:00.260
a bucket, fixins, plus free slaw!

07:00.790 --> 07:02.359
Clowns almost made me miss that.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.740
Honey, I told you...

07:03.750 --> 07:06.059
tonight we are dining with the Colonel.

07:06.060 --> 07:08.840
We need a fresh vegetable, so
I'm opening a can of beans.

07:09.740 --> 07:11.659
Well, this just about tears it!

07:11.660 --> 07:13.060
I am fit to be tied!

07:13.070 --> 07:15.320
Oh, Frank, stop talking
like an elderly person.

07:15.330 --> 07:18.791
William staged a power-grab
at choir practice.

07:18.792 --> 07:21.627
Came in throwing "suggestions"
at Sister Euphemia,

07:21.628 --> 07:24.380
who rolled over like an Irish Setter.

07:24.980 --> 07:27.040
Sounds like you got
William back in the fold.

07:27.050 --> 07:29.439
Yeah, but I didn't realize
it would upset Frank.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.839
So that's just gravy.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.459
Mmm. Savory country gravy.

07:33.460 --> 07:35.099
Time to pick up the chicken.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.160
Mm.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.209
Hey, I hear you're whipping
the choir into shape.

07:38.210 --> 07:40.180
Good job.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.979
I hear Frank isn't too happy about it.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.959
He's mad because he thinks
his voice is a tenor.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.778
I would rank it more of
a four-and-a-halfer.

07:47.779 --> 07:49.363
Yes, it's a bad joke,

07:49.364 --> 07:51.709
but it doesn't diminish the
importance of the message.

07:51.710 --> 07:53.859
- Frank stinks.
- You can't kick him out.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.419
They already spent good
money on that special robe

07:55.420 --> 07:57.121
that makes him look like
he's got shoulders.

07:57.122 --> 07:58.789
I told him he can stay

07:58.790 --> 08:01.249
if he just moves his lips
without making any noise.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.179
Oh, if only I could get him
to do that around here.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.499
We sounded really good tonight.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.899
In fact, Father Abdi stopped
by and asked us to sing

08:06.900 --> 08:08.964
on the "Mass for Shut-Ins"
show this Sunday.

08:08.965 --> 08:10.080
What do you know?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.699
Because of church,
you're gonna sing on TV.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.679
Acoustics in our house
were a funny thing.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.639
Sometimes, I couldn't
hear my mother tell me

08:16.640 --> 08:18.999
to pick up a dirty
sock from 2 feet away,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.719
... on TV... on TV... but other times...

08:20.720 --> 08:22.739
You hear that, Timmy?

08:22.740 --> 08:25.779
William's gonna sing on TV?

08:25.780 --> 08:30.519

08:30.520 --> 08:35.919

08:40.850 --> 08:45.629

08:46.400 --> 08:49.599
William, your lovely
voice has drawn from me

08:49.600 --> 08:51.519
long-dormant feelings...

08:51.520 --> 08:54.080
passions, innocence untouched,

08:54.100 --> 08:57.390
but longing... so much longing.

08:57.391 --> 08:59.599
I'm... sorry, Sister.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.439
No. You were wonderful.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.840
I think we have found our soloist!

09:03.850 --> 09:06.567
Excuse me, Sister.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.150
I'd like to audition for the solo.

09:10.153 --> 09:11.799
What are you doing here?

09:11.800 --> 09:12.879
Isn't it obvious?

09:12.880 --> 09:15.419
Timmy can never stand anybody
getting more attention than him.

09:15.420 --> 09:16.659
He'd climb up on that cross

09:16.660 --> 09:18.160
if he wasn't scared of splinters.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.019
Listen, Ruth, William's a doll,

09:21.020 --> 09:23.640
and he'd be fine if this
was just a church gig,

09:23.650 --> 09:27.019
but on television, you're
competing for eyeballs.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.860
There are, like, four channels now.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.840
So you have got to pop out
of that screen and grab 'em!

09:31.850 --> 09:33.135
Let me give you a little taste.

09:33.136 --> 09:35.360
Billy, B-flat.

Who are you sending those postcards to?

10:12.640 --> 10:14.179
Show business power players...

10:14.180 --> 10:16.280
Lew Wasserman, Stanley Kubrick.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.460
Folks who'll want to catch
my solo Sunday morning.

10:18.470 --> 10:20.420
I'm gonna be the first
person in our family on TV.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.619
Not true. Your cousin
Brenda used to pal around

10:22.620 --> 10:23.999
with those Manson girls.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.929
She made it into all the
courtroom sketches.

10:25.930 --> 10:29.279
It seems very unlikely to me
that your industry big shots

10:29.280 --> 10:31.200
are gonna be watching
the "Mass for Shut-Ins."

10:31.210 --> 10:32.639
You mean a guy like Lew Wasserman,

10:32.640 --> 10:34.139
running a big studio?

10:34.140 --> 10:35.821
I doubt he has time to get to Mass.

10:35.822 --> 10:39.367
You took a beautiful hymn
and made it an abomination!

10:39.368 --> 10:42.287
Sounds like you might be jealous
somebody took your solo.

10:42.288 --> 10:45.040
I care about honoring the music.

10:45.050 --> 10:47.019
You don't add a whoopee
cushion to Mozart.

10:47.020 --> 10:49.461
You do if you want to
get butts in the seats.

10:49.462 --> 10:51.579
You've taken the one thing
I like about church

10:51.580 --> 10:53.039
and you made it about butts.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.919
My mom's plan was starting to unravel.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.160
She now worried William might

10:56.170 --> 10:57.899
stop making music for
the Catholic Church

10:57.900 --> 10:59.619
and end up making music at the airport,

10:59.620 --> 11:01.879
with a shaved head and a tambourine.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.859
You know, Timmy...

11:04.860 --> 11:07.889
you're gonna have plenty of
opportunities to be on TV.

11:07.890 --> 11:09.479
Maybe you should let
William have this one.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.559
Mom, this isn't about me anymore, okay?

11:12.560 --> 11:14.110
I've got to do this for the shut-ins.

11:14.111 --> 11:16.112
A lot of them don't get any sunshine.

11:16.113 --> 11:18.359
They need me to bring it to them.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.799
Sorry I'm late.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.549
There's a dumb mattress in
the middle of the street

11:21.550 --> 11:23.240
on Glenoaks. I'm gonna call it in.

11:23.245 --> 11:24.954
What size is it? Eddie needs a new bed.

11:24.955 --> 11:26.247
It's in the road, Peg.

11:26.248 --> 11:28.128
Well, does that mean stains
or just tire tracks?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.290
Father picks up a little overtime.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.760
Suddenly, we're too fancy
for a street mattress.

11:36.540 --> 11:38.589
- Hello?
- Hello?

11:38.590 --> 11:40.139
Who's on this line? Is that Eddie?

11:40.140 --> 11:41.589
Joey, it's Dad.

11:41.590 --> 11:43.359
What's going on?

11:43.360 --> 11:44.549
Hey, Pop!

11:44.550 --> 11:46.299
We finally got through to KYWW.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.059
We're on hold right now
as caller number 6.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.103
Where are you?

11:49.104 --> 11:50.435
How are you even on this phone?

11:50.436 --> 11:51.619
Okay, full disclosure...

11:51.620 --> 11:53.519
I kinda spliced into our phone line

11:53.520 --> 11:55.317
and ran an extension up to my office.

11:55.318 --> 11:57.236
Turns out I'm pretty technological.

11:57.237 --> 11:58.863
Must've gotten that from you.

11:58.864 --> 12:00.991
You're about to get
something else from me.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.759
Dad!

12:02.760 --> 12:03.990
Don't mess this up!

12:03.994 --> 12:05.219
We've been calling day and night

12:05.220 --> 12:06.620
trying to win this.

12:08.070 --> 12:09.100
No!!

12:09.110 --> 12:10.379
What do you know?

12:10.380 --> 12:12.999
It hit the ground just
like a lead zeppelin.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.299
Hello, caller number 6?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.159
- Who is this?
- Don't hang up, Dad!

12:16.160 --> 12:17.179
Do not hang up!

12:17.180 --> 12:20.179
It's Rockin' Rocky at KYWW Radio!

12:20.180 --> 12:22.910
Good... you can get the word
out regarding a Sigalert...

12:22.920 --> 12:24.179
... on Glenoaks Avenue.

12:24.180 --> 12:26.179
It's a mattress... probably
fell off a U-Haul.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.699
People don't tie them down
like they're supposed to.

12:27.700 --> 12:30.145
You're killing me, old
man. You're killing me!

12:31.104 --> 12:32.562
Dad, you gotta say the slogan.

12:32.563 --> 12:34.659
- Who am I speaking with?
- Michael Cleary.

12:34.660 --> 12:37.749
The unfortunate father
of two idiot sons who...

12:37.750 --> 12:40.160
Ooh! Sounds like we've got a grumpy dad.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.340
Well, tell me, Grumpy Dad,

12:41.350 --> 12:43.559
are you ready to have
Zeppelin rock your world?

12:43.560 --> 12:45.240
That seems extremely unlikely.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.119
Just repeat our slogan
and win the prize.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.139
"KYWW plays all the hits!" Say it!

12:49.140 --> 12:51.369
"KYWW plays all the hits!"

12:51.370 --> 12:52.940
Please, please, please!

12:52.960 --> 12:54.999
So, what do you say, Grumpster?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.019
I can't just say something
I don't know to be true

12:57.020 --> 12:58.899
on the public airways.
It might be perjury.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.260
We could lose the house.

13:00.270 --> 13:02.560
Ooh! Grumpy Dad is the most!

13:02.570 --> 13:04.319
I don't just give my endorsement

13:04.320 --> 13:05.719
without believing in the product.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.399
You're not endorsing the music!

13:07.400 --> 13:08.475
You're just stating a fact!

13:08.476 --> 13:11.739
There is no way I am saying
"KYWW plays all the hits"

13:11.740 --> 13:14.079
- without first knowing if that...
- He said it! You said it!

13:14.080 --> 13:16.619
- I heard you, Dad! I heard you!
- You said it! He said it!

13:16.620 --> 13:18.651
You just won two tickets
to Led Zeppelin!

13:18.652 --> 13:20.199
Pick 'em up at will-call.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.880
See you at the concert, Grumpy Dad!

13:21.890 --> 13:23.210
Don't forget about that mattress.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.319
We won tickets to Zeppelin!

13:26.320 --> 13:29.099
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I believe Grumpy Dad

13:29.100 --> 13:30.240
won those tickets.

13:30.247 --> 13:32.289
Your mom and I used to go to
a lot of concerts together.

13:32.290 --> 13:35.209
You know, I recall one
of our first dates ever

13:35.210 --> 13:37.211
was with Vaughn Monroe and his band

13:37.212 --> 13:39.320
at The Twin Coaches
outside of Pittsburgh.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.749
Dad's talking about the past again.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.169
Oh, my God, this is the same stage

13:45.170 --> 13:47.220
where they shoot the
"Boxcar Benji" show!

13:48.200 --> 13:50.209
Wonderful... Timmy in
his natural habitat,

13:50.210 --> 13:51.559
among the freaks of Hollyweird.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.019
Honey! It's not polite to
call these weirdos freaks.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.029
This is the crate

13:55.030 --> 13:57.439
where Benji always
goes to sleep one off.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.959
And right there is the windowsill

13:58.960 --> 14:01.039
where every week, a lucky junior hobo

14:01.040 --> 14:02.480
tries to steal the widow's pie.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.439
Those of you appearing on-camera
need to report for makeup.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.829
I will not be wearing any makeup.

14:07.830 --> 14:08.850
I am nobody's fop.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.479
I need a number-three base, or
I wash out under the lights.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.300
Okay, kid. Let's go.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.399
Why would you make me come

14:17.400 --> 14:19.584
just to watch Timmy
butcher my favorite hymn?

14:19.585 --> 14:22.279
What if something happens to
Timmy and he can't sing today?

14:22.280 --> 14:24.219
Well, then you would be
here to save the day.

14:24.220 --> 14:25.424
What's gonna happen to Timmy?

14:25.425 --> 14:26.940
I don't know yet.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.439
But in the meantime,
think about the shut-ins.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.879
It brings them joy to see the
shiny faces of children.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.800
Does nothing for me, but
they don't get out much.

14:35.478 --> 14:37.479
So, are you nervous, Timmy Cleary?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.789
This is actually my first
starring role on TV.

14:39.790 --> 14:40.899
Hmm.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.320
It doesn't seem appropriate

14:42.330 --> 14:45.071
for you to think of yourself
as the "star" of this Mass.

14:45.072 --> 14:46.400
I get it.

14:46.410 --> 14:48.399
This is your rodeo.
You want top billing.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.499
No, I simply meant that you should...

14:49.500 --> 14:51.328
Father, they're ready for you.

14:52.537 --> 14:55.449
Stay tuned for Sunday
"Mass for Shut-Ins,"

14:55.450 --> 14:56.460
coming up next.

14:56.470 --> 14:57.579
While Lawrence prepared to record

14:57.580 --> 14:58.833
my historic TV appearance

14:58.834 --> 15:00.319
using the technology of the day,

15:00.320 --> 15:01.760
Joey and Eddie were still trying

15:01.770 --> 15:04.754
to get their hands on my
dad's Zeppelin tickets,

15:04.755 --> 15:06.799
demonstrating a
determination and ingenuity

15:06.800 --> 15:08.320
which would've made Dad proud...

15:08.330 --> 15:10.709
if they weren't also ripping him off.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.779
Pretty good.

15:12.780 --> 15:15.799
And now for the finishing touch.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.359
You really think the guys at will-call

15:17.360 --> 15:18.499
will believe I'm Dad?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.439
Are you kidding? You
look so much like Dad,

15:20.440 --> 15:22.400
you should be calling
yourself an idiot right now.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.120
Timmy's show's about to start.

15:25.750 --> 15:26.860
Nice try, pal.

15:29.380 --> 15:30.699
Idiot.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.699
Hey, hey!

15:33.700 --> 15:35.900
Is there any chance that I might
see Benji around here today?

15:35.920 --> 15:37.779
Oh.

15:37.780 --> 15:39.279
Well, you never know with this guy.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.699
Some days, he flies in

15:40.700 --> 15:42.890
from his private island
on his helicopter

15:42.900 --> 15:44.169
just to sit in his dressing room

15:44.170 --> 15:45.673
and check out his stock portfolio.

15:45.674 --> 15:47.049
He's got a helicopter?

15:47.050 --> 15:48.219
Of course!

15:48.220 --> 15:49.739
You don't think he's
some pathetic burn-out

15:49.740 --> 15:52.059
who moonlights on the weekend and
had to pawn his Daytime Emmy

15:52.060 --> 15:53.299
just to keep up with three alimonies.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.539
That would be sad!

15:57.000 --> 15:58.200
Save your money, kid.

15:58.210 --> 16:00.680
And do not marry women who
are too pretty for you.

16:02.140 --> 16:03.719
Mom, he just said that Boxcar Benji

16:03.720 --> 16:05.318
might be in his dressing room right now!

16:05.319 --> 16:07.000
What are you waiting for?! Go!

16:07.010 --> 16:09.000
It's almost time. I don't want
them starting without me.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.198
How could they? You're
the star of this Mass.

16:11.199 --> 16:13.709
Thank you! Now explain
that to Father Abdi.

16:19.450 --> 16:20.760
All right, places.

16:20.770 --> 16:22.210
Two minutes to air.

16:23.420 --> 16:24.570
Hello?

16:24.580 --> 16:25.820
Hello?!

16:25.840 --> 16:28.519
Where is Timmy? The
program's about to begin!

16:28.520 --> 16:30.100
Sorry, Sister, Timmy left.

16:30.110 --> 16:31.949
I guess William will
have to sing his part.

16:31.950 --> 16:32.959
Timmy left?

16:32.960 --> 16:35.090
One of his brothers has
taken seriously ill.

16:35.098 --> 16:37.599
- Will you be leaving, too?
- Eh, Timmy's got it covered.

16:39.010 --> 16:42.499
Places. One minute to air.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.857
Everyone take their cue from William.

16:44.858 --> 16:47.809
And all I ask from you, my dear boy,

16:47.810 --> 16:51.519
is that you transfix us with
your pure angelic voice,

16:51.520 --> 16:53.079
as you did the other day,

16:53.080 --> 16:54.980
right before your brother came in

16:55.000 --> 16:56.599
and did it just a little better.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.160
I won't let you down, Sister.

16:59.170 --> 17:02.164
More importantly, I won't
let down the music.

17:02.165 --> 17:04.040
S-Since we're one vocalist short,

17:04.050 --> 17:06.713
instead of just moving my
lips, could I maybe...

17:06.714 --> 17:07.719
No!

17:07.720 --> 17:11.467
We're on the air in five, four...

17:11.468 --> 17:13.839
Somebody please open the door!

17:14.710 --> 17:15.959
Hello?!

17:15.960 --> 17:18.339
Welcome to the "Mass for Shut-Ins,"

17:18.349 --> 17:22.118
our weekly broadcast of
the Catholic liturgy.

17:22.119 --> 17:23.760
I welcome you in Christ's name.

17:23.780 --> 17:26.098
Let us begin with an opening hymn.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.269
Come on. Sing.

17:36.270 --> 17:37.280
God's waiting!

17:39.000 --> 17:45.074

17:48.210 --> 17:49.899
I got this.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.749
Hunh! Ungh!

17:53.140 --> 17:55.960
Oh, I'm glad I captured
that for posterity.

17:56.020 --> 17:58.180
If you want something done right...

18:00.960 --> 18:06.599
- ♪ Ooh, ooh, o-o-oh ♪
- ♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪

18:06.600 --> 18:11.360
- ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪
- ♪ Lord, God Almighty ♪

18:11.500 --> 18:15.499
- ♪ Ooh, ooh, o-o-oh ♪

18:15.500 --> 18:18.367
Mom's really nice when she

18:18.368 --> 18:22.159
♪ ... to Thee ♪

18:22.160 --> 18:26.679
♪ Holy, Thou art holy ♪

18:26.680 --> 18:31.380

18:31.381 --> 18:35.926
No! This is the worst thing
to happen to anyone ever!

18:35.927 --> 18:42.789
♪ ... in love and purity ♪

18:45.000 --> 18:46.879
More fan mail for me.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.340
Apparently I'm the reason

18:48.350 --> 18:50.619
"Barry from Culver City Renal Care"

18:50.620 --> 18:52.999
found the strength to soldier on.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.679
Although, he might just
be buttering me up

18:54.680 --> 18:55.946
for one of my kidneys.

18:55.947 --> 18:57.447
- Aww.
- Another one from prison.

18:57.448 --> 19:00.325
Says he's a "fan for life."

19:00.326 --> 19:02.669
I can't believe I got locked out.

19:02.670 --> 19:04.699
I still feel like William had
something to do with it.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.375
He did have motive and opportunity.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.819
- Oh. Here's one for you.
- Really?!

19:10.820 --> 19:12.749
One of your postcards came back.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.340
I don't think the producers
of "The Waltons"

19:14.350 --> 19:16.049
actually live on Walton's Mountain.

19:18.570 --> 19:20.779
Mom, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

19:20.780 --> 19:22.560
Yeah, and I said knock it off.

19:22.570 --> 19:24.349
You can pick whatever
godless cult you want to

19:24.350 --> 19:25.779
when you turn 18, but for now,

19:25.780 --> 19:27.209
every Sunday, you're in that pew

19:27.210 --> 19:28.687
gutting it out with the rest of us.

19:28.688 --> 19:30.550
I've realized what
happened to me at the show

19:30.560 --> 19:33.060
couldn't have just been an accident.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.260
God struck me mute,

19:35.270 --> 19:38.639
like the Angel Gabriel did to
Zachariah in the Gospel of Luke.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.908
You know the story.

19:39.909 --> 19:41.939
Sure. But... refresh me.

19:41.940 --> 19:44.600
Zachariah was punished
for his lack of faith.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.160
And maybe I was, too.

19:46.164 --> 19:48.332
So I'm back on board with Catholicism...

19:48.333 --> 19:50.250
mainly because I'm
scared to death of God.

19:50.251 --> 19:52.499
Oh, sweetie.

19:54.170 --> 19:56.619
You finally get it.

19:56.620 --> 19:57.660
Mm.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.499
I got 'em.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.931
Now the question is,
what do I do with them?

20:03.932 --> 20:06.240
Give them to Eddie and Joey?

20:06.250 --> 20:08.400
And then wait 2 1/2 hours
to give us a ride home?

20:09.260 --> 20:10.810
I pushed it too far, didn't I?

20:10.813 --> 20:12.147
All right. Here you go.

20:12.148 --> 20:13.524
- Oh!
- Oh, hang on.

20:13.525 --> 20:15.379
These tickets are worth $7?

20:15.380 --> 20:18.029
What do they do, come over after
the concert and paint your house?

20:18.030 --> 20:19.079
That's only face value.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.448
Scalpers are getting 50 or 60 bucks.

20:21.449 --> 20:22.866
50 or 60?!

20:22.867 --> 20:24.829
W...

20:24.830 --> 20:26.495
I could see these
people being that dumb.

20:26.496 --> 20:28.289
Dad, come on.

20:28.290 --> 20:30.079
Remember that time you and
your brother skipped school

20:30.080 --> 20:32.123
to see Babe Ruth play
against the Pirates?

20:32.124 --> 20:33.599
Oh, a day I'll never forget.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.000
The Great Bambino hit his
last home run in the majors.

20:36.010 --> 20:37.240
And as he rounded the bases,

20:37.250 --> 20:39.749
he ate 12 hot dogs and
finished a case of beer!

20:41.050 --> 20:43.263
Greatest athlete this
country will ever know.

20:43.264 --> 20:44.319
Exactly.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.431
And Led Zeppelin is our Babe Ruth.

20:46.432 --> 20:48.419
So don't rob us of countless memories

20:48.420 --> 20:49.940
we can bore our kids with.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.419
- Yeah! Thanks, Dad!
- Ah!

20:53.420 --> 20:54.840
I'll meet you at our seats.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.484
For some reason, I need a hot dog.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.019
I got one here! One here!

21:00.020 --> 21:01.399
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

21:01.400 --> 21:04.379
Memories are great, but
60 bucks is 60 bucks.

21:04.380 --> 21:06.460
You're abandoning your
brother to pocket some cash?

21:07.260 --> 21:08.680
Okay, tell you what...

21:08.690 --> 21:10.679
what if I used that cash to buy us both

21:10.680 --> 21:12.550
a nice steak dinner at Sizzler?

21:15.380 --> 21:16.840
We got one here!

21:16.850 --> 21:18.360
One! One here!

21:18.370 --> 21:20.079
Floor seating, section D!

21:20.080 --> 21:22.959
- 60 bucks!
- Section D, we've got one!

21:22.960 --> 21:25.539
- Best deal all night, all night!
- Hey, hey, buddy, you want it?
