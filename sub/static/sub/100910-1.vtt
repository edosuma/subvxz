WEBVTT

01:55.506 --> 01:57.465
Fuck.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.554
This rain is making me
have to pee.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.558
Why you meeting this guy
in Truro?

02:03.688 --> 02:05.429
It's the middle
of fucking nowhere.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.170
It's the new guy.

02:07.301 --> 02:08.867
It's where he wanted to meet.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.522
I should not be here.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.045
Relax.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.135
Here.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.919
It's fentanyl...

02:17.049 --> 02:19.139
for cancer people.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.360
Bitch, I just got
out of treatment.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.233
Okay.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.147
Sorry.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.768
Seriously, though,
good for you, Krista.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.817
I could never quit.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.168
Yeah, you could.

02:53.129 --> 02:55.305
How do I look?
Hmm?

02:55.436 --> 02:58.265
Think he'll give me
two fingers for seven?

02:58.395 --> 03:00.702
- I don't know.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.489
Are you being careful?

03:05.576 --> 03:07.143
I got a cop looking out for me.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.237
My fucking nails...

03:14.368 --> 03:16.718
Give me that.

03:19.329 --> 03:22.811
Those nails are...something.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.987
Black and red
hoochie nails.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.383
These nails
are fucking beautiful.

03:29.513 --> 03:32.995
Okay.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.431
Mm...

03:34.562 --> 03:35.693
Sherry, where the fuck
is this dude?

03:35.780 --> 03:37.042
I got to pee.

03:37.173 --> 03:40.350
Go for it, bro.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.222
You're in the middle
of fucking nowhere, right?

03:45.660 --> 03:47.575
Fuck it.

03:52.493 --> 03:53.276
Love you!

03:57.280 --> 03:58.194
Love you...

04:25.526 --> 04:26.831
You Sherry?

04:26.918 --> 04:28.224
- Yeah.
- Cool.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.190
Ain't pretty no more.

04:42.543 --> 04:43.892
Hey, go pop the trunk.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.085
Text the guy.
Tell him you're on the way.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.494
Hey, take it easy.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.366
I feel like shit.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.411
Not my fault
you can't handle your liquor.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.892
Liquor?
I don't even know her.

06:11.022 --> 06:14.199
Like that ever stopped you.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.379
3:00. I thought we were
calling in early.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.424
Hunniker called.
He wants us to do a spot-check

06:21.555 --> 06:23.165
on the Jack and Bobby II.

06:23.295 --> 06:24.862
- What?
- He's got a hard-on
for Michael.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.299
On a Friday?
It's Carnival weekend.
That's bullshit.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.956
Yo, you should come to P-Town,
have a drink.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.002
Last time I was in P-Town,

06:34.132 --> 06:36.787
I saw, like,
three dudes' balls.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.093
- I don't even want to see
my own.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.529
Yeah, that makes two of us.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.879
Besides, Linda's
making scrod.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.577
- Oh, well...
- Hey, Jackie, uh,
you want to take the wheel?

06:43.707 --> 06:45.622
I got to piss.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.510
Special Agents Ed Murphy,
Jackie Quinones,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.729
National Marine
Fishery Services.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.252
Eddie Murphy--
I ever tell you

07:07.383 --> 07:08.863
you were great
in Beverly Hills Cop?

07:08.993 --> 07:10.908
- Ah, fuck off, Michael.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.823
What kind of bullshit
am I gonna find
in here today, Junior?

07:12.910 --> 07:14.651
No bullshit, Jack.
Everything's legit.

07:14.782 --> 07:15.957
Oh, yeah? What's this?

07:18.568 --> 07:20.962
Cut me some slack,
dude, please.

07:21.092 --> 07:24.269
Got female with roe and a couple undersized males.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.316
You guys have been warned
about the short lobsters.
An egger is worse.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.318
I got to tell you
how you're fucking yourself
and the rest of your fleet?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.668
God help me, I love the kid--
he's my only son--

07:31.755 --> 07:34.149
but he can't fish for shit,
and I don't have eyes
on the back of my head.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.977
Yeah, yeah.
You know, if I had a dollar

07:36.107 --> 07:38.153
for every time I heard
the words "honest mistake"...

07:38.283 --> 07:39.284
I got to write you up now.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.722
Ed, please.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.681
I'm the last of a dying breed--
the fishermen of Provincetown,

07:44.812 --> 07:48.032
just trying to earn
an honest living from the sea.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.773
There's no way I'm going
back to the office today.

07:49.904 --> 07:51.079
You want to write him up,
you type the report.

07:54.691 --> 07:57.912
I should make you do it
just for mouthing off
to a superior agent.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.828
Come on, Ed.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.438
It's Carnival weekend.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.180
Ah, fuck it.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.921
All right, we're gonna
let you off with a verbal.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.358
No more shorts, no more eggers.
Got it?

08:09.445 --> 08:11.665
Thanks.
Won't happen again.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.626
See you
at the bar tonight, Jack?

08:16.713 --> 08:19.542
Yeah.
You're buying.

08:31.075 --> 08:33.861
8:00 showtime.
Scorpion Bay.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.042
Ah!

08:55.883 --> 08:57.928
- Hey.
- Hey, Jack!

08:58.059 --> 08:59.234
- Get my text?
- Yeah. What are you having?

08:59.364 --> 09:00.670
Shot of Jack.

09:00.801 --> 09:01.758
All right.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.064
You working all night?

09:03.194 --> 09:04.108
Something like that.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.854
Yo, hook me up
with that storeroom key.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.773
- Really?
- What?

09:16.904 --> 09:18.122
You never seen a cock before?

09:18.209 --> 09:19.384
You know I'm a gold star.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.951
Then I know
you've seen a dildo.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.869
Ahh.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.399
Scorpion Bay!
One night only.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.966
- Comp ticket for you
at the door, Jackie.
- Thank you, baby.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.489
Come see us, girl.
Ladies, 8:00 p.m. showtime.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.752
Thank you.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.193
Oh, shit, it's the McCarthys.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.542
Oh, it's the fish cop.
Hands up.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.631
You're under arrest,
you lobster-poaching mick fuck.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.807
Allegedlylobster-poaching
mick fuck.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.809
What's up?
He tear you a new one?

09:52.896 --> 09:54.855
Eh, no worse than usual.
Hey, actually,
this one of Mackayleigh?

09:54.942 --> 09:56.596
- I just got it.
- Aww.

09:56.726 --> 09:57.727
- You must be proud.
- I'd be proud

09:57.858 --> 09:58.989
if he moved out of our house

09:59.120 --> 10:00.251
and got back together
with Donna.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.166
We're working it out.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.038
Yo, three shots of whiskey,
on his tab.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.256
- You got it.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.738
Who's that?
Where's Frances?

10:08.869 --> 10:10.000
Oh, she's in Florida.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.046
That's her nephew
from Dennis Port.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.570
Says he's never been
to P-Town.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.659
Oh, yeah?

10:19.053 --> 10:21.403
I ever tell you about the time
I blew a dude?

10:21.533 --> 10:24.145
- Shut up.
- What the fuck?
Lower your voice.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.625
What? No, it's true, right?
About a year and a half ago,

10:25.755 --> 10:27.452
I went up to Foxwoods
with some buddies,

10:27.583 --> 10:29.411
ended up having
to hitch a ride back.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.152
First car
lets me off in Hyannis
in the fucking pouring rain.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.501
I mean, I'm getting soaked.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.850
- Ah, shit.
- It's like 30 degrees.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.852
Yeah, it was
more like sleet, almost.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.158
So some car stops for me.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.812
Older--older guy.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.291
Said he's only going
as far as Orleans.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.466
I says, "Look, mister,
it's pouring rain.

10:41.597 --> 10:42.598
"I don't got any money,

10:42.729 --> 10:43.730
"but if you can take me
to P-Town,

10:43.860 --> 10:45.079
I'd sure appreciate it."

10:45.209 --> 10:47.385
And he says,
"Yeah, I could do that."

10:47.516 --> 10:49.910
But...

10:50.040 --> 10:51.694
But I got to suck his dick.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.565
- Oh.
- Fuck that.
I'd beat the shit out of him.

10:53.696 --> 10:54.697
Well, that was
my first reaction,

10:54.828 --> 10:56.133
but, you know,
Donna was pregnant,

10:56.264 --> 10:57.918
she's breaking my balls
to get home,

10:58.005 --> 11:00.007
and it's fucking raining,
so I said, "Screw it.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.312
How bad can it be?"

11:01.443 --> 11:02.313
So I blew the guy.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.272
Dude, what the fuck?

11:04.402 --> 11:06.143
I got you.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.797
I'm--I'm joking.
Sorry. Made--I made it all up.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.453
Ah, dude,
you should've seen your face.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.802
Oh, my God.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.196
No, but, seriously,
I made it all up.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.850
It wasn't raining.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.988
Get it? It wasn't raining.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.860
Get it?

11:29.210 --> 11:31.168
- Fucking asshole.
- Got it. He got it.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.909
Hey, welcome to P-Town, son.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.519
Now get us some drinks,
you homophobic prick.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.609
Every time.
Yo, you want that?

11:37.740 --> 11:38.567
No, I'm taking it easy tonight.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.395
Good.
More for me.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.310
All right, fuck it.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.355
I'm not spending the rest
of the night with you clowns.

11:44.442 --> 11:45.487
Hey, you ever get tired
of it, Jack?

11:45.617 --> 11:46.749
Tired of what?

11:46.880 --> 11:47.881
All that fucking pussy?

12:32.403 --> 12:33.840
Jack and Diet.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.232
Coming right up.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.321
Hey.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.802
- Hey.
- You here for the weekend?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.325
Yeah.
Then I go back to school.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.719
Oh, yeah? Where's that?
Thanks.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.808
- Wesleyan.
- All-girls school.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.549
Uh, no.
You're thinking of Wellesley.

12:47.679 --> 12:51.553
Mm.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.598
What about you?
How long are you here for?

12:53.729 --> 12:56.471
Oh, I live here.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.952
I'm in law enforcement.

13:00.649 --> 13:03.130
Oh, wow.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.827
Do you, like, carry a gun?

13:07.003 --> 13:08.091
Yeah.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.099
So where are you staying?

13:41.951 --> 13:43.823
You're up.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.793
Oh, fuck.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.527
Oh, my God.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.174
Who the hell is that?

15:58.305 --> 16:00.350
- Fucking Ray.

16:03.701 --> 16:04.964
Just because you don't have
a family

16:05.094 --> 16:06.704
doesn't mean you can just roll
the fuck up, man.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.185
It's called boundaries.
Pick up a phone.
Make a fucking phone call.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.100
Your phone is off.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.710
- Look, man, I--
- That's against
State Police regulations.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.190
Look, man, we got
a four-month-old baby.

16:14.277 --> 16:15.757
We're not getting any rest.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.107
I got to turn
that phone off, man.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.240
They just fished a Jane Doe
out of the bay in Provincetown.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.851
Gunshot.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.853
Man, did body side ask
for us specifically?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.855
Drug side's gonna have a hand

16:26.986 --> 16:29.205
in all Cape Cod homicide
investigations from now on.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.251
- Since when?
- You didn't read the memo?

16:31.381 --> 16:32.600
Memo? What memo?
Who wrote this memo?

16:32.730 --> 16:35.081
- Me. Get dressed.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.517
Summer traffic, it's gonna take
us an hour to get down there

16:36.647 --> 16:37.866
if we don't leave right now.

16:37.997 --> 16:38.823
Shit.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.658
Not too much longer now, Jack.

16:47.789 --> 16:48.920
You doing okay?

16:51.488 --> 16:54.013
Yeah.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.536
You got somebody
to talk to about this?

16:55.666 --> 16:57.929
It's a traumatic event.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.409
I'm from New Bedford.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.542
You think I've never seen
a dead body before?

17:01.672 --> 17:03.631
Hey, you Chief Schellenbach?

17:04.893 --> 17:06.721
Hi.
Ray Abruzzo.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.551
This is Trooper Alan Saintille,
State Police.

17:10.681 --> 17:11.595
- How you doing?
- Yeah, I already talked
to State Police.

17:11.726 --> 17:12.988
You guys are taking the case.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.511
No, you spoke
with Homicide Unit.

17:14.642 --> 17:15.904
We're Narcotics,
from up in Hyannis.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.558
We cover all of Cape Cod.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.908
We liaise between the body guys
and the local PD,

17:20.039 --> 17:21.605
but we're not here to step
on anybody's toes.

17:21.736 --> 17:24.086
Oh, hey, it's all yours.
I-I don't need this shit.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.175
I got 60,000 people
coming to town for Carnival.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.264
She been ID'd yet?

17:28.395 --> 17:30.701
No, nothing on her,
and the fingerprints
are waterlogged.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.792
She's with the M.E.

17:34.923 --> 17:37.752
You moved the body
before the scene
was fully processed?

17:37.882 --> 17:40.407
There is no scene.
Tide came and washed it away.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.148
I got pictures on my phone.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.019
Oh, yeah? Who are you?

17:44.106 --> 17:46.413
Jackie Quinones.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.807
I already--I already gave
my statement to them.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.026
You want to give one to me?

17:52.810 --> 17:55.596
All right, um...

17:55.726 --> 17:59.034
I took a walk around 6:00,
low tide.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.950
Saw something
about 20 yards east
to the sea wall over there.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.169
I approached, saw the girl.

18:03.299 --> 18:04.474
It was obvious
she didn't need CPR,

18:04.605 --> 18:06.302
so I called it in to PMP,

18:06.433 --> 18:08.696
but the tide was rolling in
fast, so I took photos.

18:11.307 --> 18:12.352
I'm in law enforcement--

18:12.482 --> 18:13.222
National Marine
Fishery Service.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.181
Okay.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.183
You guys had some problems
back in the day, right?

18:17.313 --> 18:19.141
Fishermen bringing in bales
of weed right under your nose?

18:21.143 --> 18:23.232
Yeah, like, 40 years ago.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.712
Who do you work with, again?

18:24.842 --> 18:26.975
Cape Cod Interagency
Narcotics Unit.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.369
Fancy.
Y'all work with DEA?

18:29.499 --> 18:31.588
No, state, local,
and sheriff's, mostly.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.329
But we'll take anybody.
You looking for a job?

18:36.419 --> 18:38.247
That ain't funny.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.858
Look, call me if you think
of anything else.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.643
Told you.
Just here to liaise.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.214
Can I go now?

18:48.344 --> 18:49.954
Yeah.
Take care of yourself.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.131
And, hey, Jack...

18:52.261 --> 18:54.785
let's take it easy at Carnival
this year, huh?

18:54.916 --> 18:56.439
Yes, ma'am.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.142
DEPUTY M.E.:
Just want to point out,
she is wearing a necklace

19:03.272 --> 19:05.318
that says "Lylas."

19:05.448 --> 19:07.276
Maybe a first name?

19:07.363 --> 19:09.887
Ah, fuck.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.065
Fuck.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.506
Frankie Cuevas.

19:19.636 --> 19:20.768
We don't know that.

19:20.898 --> 19:23.336
I know it.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.076
Where are you going?

19:26.774 --> 19:28.558
We rode together.

19:32.823 --> 19:33.911
What you looking at?

19:34.042 --> 19:34.999
Nothing.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.827
Name is Sherry Henry,

19:36.958 --> 19:38.742
and it's "Love You
Like a Sister," dumbass.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.408
Miss, honey,

19:52.539 --> 19:53.801
you look like who did it and ran.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.759
Not today, Fred.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.848
You know rent was due
Wednesday.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.198
I know. I'm sorry, all right?

19:59.328 --> 20:00.721
I am working on it.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.897
Do not tempt me, Jacqueline.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.900
I will Airbnb that shit,
make a lot more money, too!

21:08.354 --> 21:09.703
Hey, Frankie.

21:16.579 --> 21:17.624
Do you know who I am?

21:19.669 --> 21:21.236
You're a Statie.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.021
That's right.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.936
I was at your arraignment.

21:27.677 --> 21:28.983
I'm the one who put you
in here.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.420
Oh, yeah?
Good for you.

21:34.728 --> 21:35.946
Trial's coming up.
How you feeling, huh?

21:36.077 --> 21:37.296
I'm feeling great,
'cause I didn't do nothing.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.036
No, no, you are my guy.

21:39.167 --> 21:43.302
Mm, you need decking,
siding, or HVAC, I'm your guy.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.826
Beyond that...

21:45.956 --> 21:49.003
You do know your whole crew's
going away, right?

21:49.133 --> 21:50.570
I mean, we got you
on trafficking
and distribution.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.093
You're looking at 15 years.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.529
But when you tack on
the homicide,

21:53.660 --> 21:56.576
oh, it's a whole new deal.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.273
Juries don't like it
when white girls get capped.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.535
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.407
Don't fucking lie to me.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.234
You know Sherry Henry.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.370
Somebody fucked up, Frankie.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.938
We fished her out of the Bay this morning down in P-Town.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.898
You know, the thing is...

22:15.029 --> 22:16.900
when you dump a body,

22:17.031 --> 22:20.556
you got to slice them open
first, or else they float.

22:20.687 --> 22:23.559
But in this case, I don't think
that's what matters.

22:23.646 --> 22:26.736
The real problem is,
the B-team fuckwads
you work with--

22:26.867 --> 22:28.608
they don't know the difference
between the ocean and the bay.

22:28.738 --> 22:31.437
Fuckwads. That's very funny.

22:31.524 --> 22:32.699
But I don't know that girl.

22:32.829 --> 22:35.789
Well, she knew you.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.660
She told me
so much about you.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.449
How do you think
we knew to search
your cousin's storage shed?

22:48.279 --> 22:50.717
How's your baby mama
holding up?

22:50.847 --> 22:53.197
- Renee? That her name?
- Don't talk about Renee.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.635
I heard she likes her Oxys, but in this economy,

22:55.765 --> 22:56.897
she must be on the needle
by now.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.377
Shut the fuck up.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.248
Just want you to know
when you're doing 25 to life

23:00.335 --> 23:02.598
for trafficking, distribution,
conspiracy to commit murder

23:02.729 --> 23:05.296
and DCF takes
little Frankie Junior away
because your woman's gone,

23:05.427 --> 23:07.037
that was because of me.

23:15.263 --> 23:16.482
We're done here.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.900
Watch out.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.033
Tide's coming in.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.452
Get anything on the girl?

24:13.539 --> 24:15.323
Not much.
We don't know where she died,

24:15.454 --> 24:17.368
or where she went
into the water.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.370
Family was notified,
such as it is.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.460
I mean, she mostly grew up
in foster care.

24:21.590 --> 24:22.678
Someone spoke to an aunt.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.637
She hasn't seen her in years.

24:24.767 --> 24:28.205
Excuse me, Sergeant, where
do you think you're going?

24:28.292 --> 24:30.120
Lieutenant?

24:30.251 --> 24:31.992
You go in half-cocked

24:32.122 --> 24:34.734
and question Frankie Cuevas
about a body we just got?

24:34.864 --> 24:36.475
We don't know shit
about shit yet,

24:36.605 --> 24:38.694
but, oh, why should that stop
Ray Abruzzo?

24:38.825 --> 24:40.522
Look, it's my responsibility.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.263
Frankie had her killed
for snitching to me.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.395
How would Frankie even know
that she's a snitch?

24:44.526 --> 24:46.180
Maybe there's a leak
in the unit.

24:46.310 --> 24:47.921
Tell me you did not
just say that.
Did he just say that?

24:48.051 --> 24:49.531
- He just said that.
- I said maybe.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.490
Frankie Cuevas
is in MSC, huh?

24:51.620 --> 24:53.840
Cousin Jorge is in Concord.

24:53.927 --> 24:55.798
We shut down
the goddamn Dominicans.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.583
We shut down the white boys
who bought from them.

24:57.713 --> 24:59.933
Who's left
to pull the trigger?

25:00.020 --> 25:02.326
Somebody we don't know yet.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.111
Could be somebody new,
somebody coming up.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.504
We never got his suppliers
in New Bedford.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.680
Well, the DA just called,

25:07.810 --> 25:10.030
and she wants you to stay
the fuck away from her case.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.598
Respectfully, sir, I think
she should be thanking me.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.774
- How's that?
- They dumped the body
in the water.

25:14.904 --> 25:17.341
That means they didn't want her
found, but she was found.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.735
So what's Frankie gonna do
when he finds out his people
fucked up?

25:19.866 --> 25:21.998
He's gonna get mad,
and he's gonna get sloppy.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.827
He uses the phone.
Prison phone's recorded.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.700
And those taped conversations
are readily admissible
in court.

25:27.830 --> 25:30.703
Fine, but you're Narcotics.
Let the body side handle it.

25:30.833 --> 25:34.054
And don't waste a lot of time
on this girl.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.360
You just lost a good CI.

25:36.491 --> 25:37.666
I suggest you find a new one.

26:09.350 --> 26:13.833
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

26:24.583 --> 26:25.366
Hey, Junior!

26:31.154 --> 26:33.113
Jesus, Jackie,
I knew you were a lady-killer,

26:33.243 --> 26:34.549
but you're actually pulling 'em
out of the Bay?

26:34.636 --> 26:36.551
Shut the fuck up.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.379
Seriously, though,
what happened?
You talk to the cops?

26:38.509 --> 26:40.990
Yeah, Chief Schellenbach
and some statie.

26:41.121 --> 26:42.339
He's a dick.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.558
Anyway, I'm going
to Carnival.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.603
Yeah.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.044
At this meeting,
we hand out chips

26:51.174 --> 26:54.221
for varying lengths
of sobriety.

26:54.308 --> 26:56.527
So anyone with nine months?

26:58.051 --> 26:59.400
What do we do?

26:59.487 --> 27:00.793
Keep coming back.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.273
Anyone with six months?

27:03.404 --> 27:05.058
What do we do?

27:05.188 --> 27:06.581
Keep coming back.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.322
How about 90 days?

27:12.326 --> 27:14.633
- Junior.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.247
That's for you.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.770
Thanks.

27:25.382 --> 27:29.082
Um, hi, I'm Junior,
uh, alcoholic, addict.

27:29.212 --> 27:32.085
Hi, Junior.

27:32.215 --> 27:35.262
Um, three months ago,
I came in

27:35.392 --> 27:39.135
fucking tired and beat
to shit, and, uh...

27:39.266 --> 27:41.268
and for some reason, something
just clicked this time.

27:45.707 --> 27:46.969
Got a sponsor
who busts my balls,

27:47.100 --> 27:48.667
but it's a good thing,
you know?

27:50.973 --> 27:52.322
I was actually telling him
how much I love my daughter,

27:52.453 --> 27:53.759
and he says, "Yeah, Junior,
that's great,

27:53.889 --> 27:55.804
but how much child support
you paying?"

27:59.634 --> 28:01.984
He taught me
it's my actions that count,
not my words, and, um...

28:04.900 --> 28:07.642
You know, I guess,
now I'm just trying to get
back with my girl

28:07.773 --> 28:08.904
and working on being
a better father

28:09.035 --> 28:12.560
and a better son, and...

28:12.691 --> 28:14.780
couldn't be doing any of that
if I was still out there,
using, so...

28:16.956 --> 28:18.653
Yeah, thanks.

28:23.310 --> 28:25.138
Thank you, Junior. Thank you.

28:25.268 --> 28:28.794
All right, anybody
with, uh, 30 days?

28:40.153 --> 28:42.633
Work it.
Hey.

28:45.854 --> 28:48.030
Whoo!

29:03.480 --> 29:05.961
Hey, nice tits!

29:06.092 --> 29:07.920
Thanks.
You too!

29:10.052 --> 29:11.837
Come to Tea Dance later!

29:11.967 --> 29:12.968
What?

29:13.099 --> 29:14.187
Tea Dance!

29:14.274 --> 29:15.841
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.407
- I'll see you there.
- Okay.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.916
Hey, club soda, lime.

29:48.047 --> 29:51.224
All right, show your
appreciation for LaPorsche.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.663
And now let's give it up
for Candy.

29:55.750 --> 29:56.446
Here you go.

31:01.337 --> 31:03.513
Hey.
What's up?

31:03.644 --> 31:05.951
Found a dead body today.

31:06.081 --> 31:07.996
Want to buy me a drink?

31:08.083 --> 31:09.693
Okay.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.093
Hi.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.142
I'm Candy.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.318
Hi, Candy.

31:25.405 --> 31:29.017
You want to buy me a drink?

31:29.148 --> 31:30.540
That what you want?

31:33.761 --> 31:36.720
Or, uh, I could give you
a private dance.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.608
So where you staying?

31:54.738 --> 31:57.089
Rental place on Bradford.
What about you?

31:57.219 --> 31:59.526
I live here.
I'm in law enforcement.

31:59.656 --> 32:02.659
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

32:02.790 --> 32:05.749
It's a good thing you're hot,
because I fucking hate cops.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.274
Okay.

32:08.404 --> 32:09.884
Hey, can you still party?

32:11.364 --> 32:13.453
What do you got?

32:50.272 --> 32:52.144
I want to be close to you.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.275
I want to be with you.

32:57.932 --> 33:01.153
We can do that...

33:01.283 --> 33:03.764
as long as you're not a cop.

33:03.894 --> 33:06.332
Do I look like one?

33:06.462 --> 33:08.725
Yeah, a little bit.

33:13.426 --> 33:14.949
Show me your dick.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.657
Okay.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.616
It's gonna be 300.

33:29.746 --> 33:31.096
Is that all right?

33:39.669 --> 33:42.107
Thank you.

33:58.862 --> 34:00.255
You should stop now, Renee.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.999
How do you know
my real name?

34:05.130 --> 34:06.696
My name's Ray Abruzzo,
State Police.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.133
Oh, fuck you.

34:08.263 --> 34:09.221
Just got you for prostitution.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.527
Yeah, fuck you.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.138
You know, we haven't
even done anything yet.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.053
- Hmm?
- You're not even
fucking hard, man.

34:15.183 --> 34:16.837
Fucking cop.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.839
You think you can,
like, arrest me?

34:18.926 --> 34:20.841
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you can't do
shit, right?

34:20.971 --> 34:22.060
- Oh, yeah?
- No.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.322
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.193
Come here. Where do you
think you're going?

34:25.324 --> 34:27.456
- Sit down.
- I want a lawyer.

34:27.587 --> 34:28.805
You want a lawyer?

34:28.892 --> 34:30.024
What, do you think
you just snap your fingers,

34:30.155 --> 34:31.460
a lawyer shows up
to Xavier's parking lot?

34:31.591 --> 34:33.897
My husband has a lawyer,
good one.

34:34.028 --> 34:35.595
I got a news flash for you.

34:35.725 --> 34:37.597
Frankie ain't your husband.

34:37.727 --> 34:38.641
You know Frankie?

34:38.772 --> 34:40.948
Yeah, I know Frankie.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.341
He's not gonna be happy to find
out the mother of his child

34:42.471 --> 34:43.994
was sucking dick
in the champagne room.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.735
All right, then arrest me
already, you piece of shit.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.607
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.174
You move too fast.

34:53.482 --> 34:54.701
What if I don't want
to arrest you?

34:57.007 --> 35:00.098
What the fuck do you want?

35:00.228 --> 35:02.926
You know anything
about a dead girl in P-Town?

35:03.057 --> 35:04.667
No.

35:04.798 --> 35:05.494
I'm not a snitch.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.279
Mm.

35:07.409 --> 35:09.498
I really hate that word, Renee.

35:12.762 --> 35:14.503
I just want to talk to you.

35:14.634 --> 35:17.376
That's it.

35:17.506 --> 35:20.596
You know, you got to be lonely
with Frankie gone.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.163
I'm lonely, too.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.078
You're an asshole.

35:26.907 --> 35:29.779
All right, well, the other
option is I arrest you.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.955
In that case, you better hope
your ma can watch Frankie Jr.
till Monday,

35:32.086 --> 35:33.740
'cause that's the earliest you're getting out.

35:37.091 --> 35:39.049
I have to get back to work.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.574
That's fine.
We'll talk tomorrow.

35:45.055 --> 35:46.622
I'm going
to see Frankie tomorrow.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.537
That's all right. I'll show up early.

35:51.714 --> 35:52.846
Look at me.

35:54.891 --> 35:56.937
Okay? We good?

35:57.067 --> 35:58.417
Yeah.

35:58.547 --> 35:59.766
Yeah.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.507
Go.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.914
This isn't Cape Cod
bullshit coke either.

36:18.045 --> 36:20.178
No offense.

36:23.398 --> 36:24.965
Oh, shit.

36:25.095 --> 36:26.575
- Told you.
- Yeah.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.316
- Bitch, I'm waiting!

36:28.447 --> 36:30.362
Why, I oughta...

37:28.158 --> 37:29.508
- Ah, fuck me.

37:32.337 --> 37:33.860
What's happening?

37:33.990 --> 37:35.122
Bail commissioner
set your bail.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.732
You're being released.

37:36.863 --> 37:37.994
Wait, wait,
what happened, though?

37:38.125 --> 37:39.387
What actually happened?

37:39.474 --> 37:41.171
You don't remember?

37:55.447 --> 37:57.362
Here you go.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.320
This is a summons
to appear in court.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.975
Sign this.
Then you're free to go.

38:02.062 --> 38:04.325
Can I, uh, call--uh,
call someone or something?

38:04.456 --> 38:05.848
You already did.

38:05.979 --> 38:07.197
Your friend's waiting outside.

38:26.826 --> 38:29.481
Oh, hey!
You must be Francisco Jr.

38:29.568 --> 38:30.525
Is your mom home?

38:30.656 --> 38:31.831
Yeah, she's sleeping.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.312
Oh, no, she's sleeping?

38:34.399 --> 38:36.792
I brought her something yummy
for breakfast.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.664
Maybe you can have it.
Can you guess what I brought?

38:38.751 --> 38:40.318
Doughnuts?

38:40.405 --> 38:41.971
Doughnuts?
No, ugh!

38:42.058 --> 38:43.538
Doughnuts are gross!

38:43.669 --> 38:44.583
Doughnuts aren't gross.

38:44.713 --> 38:45.975
Really?

38:46.062 --> 38:47.281
What's your favorite kind
of doughnut?

38:47.412 --> 38:48.413
Chocolate.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.066
Mmm. Are they good?

38:50.197 --> 38:52.025
Do you think I should try one?

38:52.155 --> 38:54.157
Oh, cool. Can I come in?

38:58.727 --> 38:59.467
Ed.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.297
Fuck, man, I'm sorry.
I called you?

39:03.428 --> 39:05.125
Who the fuck else
you gonna call?

39:08.346 --> 39:09.521
Hey, your arm.
You okay there?

39:09.608 --> 39:10.783
Yeah, yeah.

39:12.741 --> 39:13.742
Could you please tell me
what happened?

39:13.873 --> 39:15.091
They won't tell me shit
in there.

39:15.222 --> 39:18.138
You flipped your car,
and, uh, your friend was hurt.

39:18.268 --> 39:19.748
Who?

39:19.879 --> 39:21.184
Jesus, Jackie,
the girl in the car.

39:21.315 --> 39:23.186
She's in the hospital.

39:23.317 --> 39:25.798
She's gonna be okay, but...

39:25.928 --> 39:27.974
I spoke to a lawyer for you,
and it's not great.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.455
He says that because
it was an injury crash,

39:30.585 --> 39:31.717
they could charge you
with a felony.

39:31.847 --> 39:32.892
What?
A felony?

39:32.979 --> 39:34.197
What does that mean?

39:34.328 --> 39:36.069
Well, it all depends
on the judge.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.723
No, no, no, no, no, man.
I can't go to jail.
I can't do that.

39:37.853 --> 39:40.029
Just cool your jets.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.596
There's things you can do
before your court date.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.253
Quit your drinking.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.820
- Go to treatment.

39:47.950 --> 39:49.387
Show the judge
you're talking this seriously.

39:49.517 --> 39:50.562
- You mean rehab?
- Yeah.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.041
Linda called around.

39:52.172 --> 39:54.130
There's this place,
Glendon House in Yarmouth.

39:54.261 --> 39:55.567
They got a bed available
if you go today.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.395
I don't need to go to rehab.

39:59.005 --> 40:01.181
Maybe it wouldn't be
the worst thing.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.402
What the fuck, Ed?

40:04.532 --> 40:06.665
Look, I'm just telling you
what the lawyer told me.

40:06.795 --> 40:09.276
- No.
- This could help you
with the judge.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.800
No, I don't need
to go to rehab, all right?
I got to go to work.

40:11.931 --> 40:14.063
And Hunniker
is not gonna give me time off
just 'cause I asked for it.

40:14.194 --> 40:15.413
Besides, he doesn't need
to know about this.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.023
- Jack.
- What?

40:17.153 --> 40:19.591
He knows.

40:19.678 --> 40:21.680
They all know.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.595
I can't keep covering for you.

40:31.733 --> 40:33.343
I'll think about it.

40:33.474 --> 40:35.563
Jackie? Don't think too hard.

40:46.356 --> 40:48.054
Baby, how many shows
have you watched?

40:49.838 --> 40:50.970
Hi!

40:52.058 --> 40:53.494
There's coffee and doughnuts
on the counter.

40:53.625 --> 40:54.452
I got you an egg and cheese,
too, if you--

40:54.582 --> 40:55.540
You okay, buddy?

40:55.670 --> 40:56.976
Yeah.

40:57.106 --> 40:57.846
Just playing Jenga.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.287
- My turn?

41:09.771 --> 41:11.251
Hey, Frankie.
You want something else?

41:11.381 --> 41:12.382
I got a blueberry glazed
over here.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.863
Mm-mm, mm,
he's had enough sugar.

41:18.214 --> 41:20.347
He's a sweet kid.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.479
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

41:26.745 --> 41:28.964
Look, I don't want you to feel
like you have to talk to me
or else.

41:29.095 --> 41:30.313
Right?
It doesn't have to be that way.

41:30.444 --> 41:31.967
Mm, but it is that way.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.012
Right?

41:34.666 --> 41:37.712
Renee, I can help you.

41:37.843 --> 41:39.975
I got connections.
I can get you into treatment.

41:40.106 --> 41:42.151
- I can get a doctor--
- I'm not fucking using.

41:45.372 --> 41:46.852
Okay.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.331
Good for you.

41:53.685 --> 41:55.861
You ever come across a girl
named Sherry Henry?

41:55.991 --> 41:57.776
That ring a bell?
Black hair, tattoos?

41:57.906 --> 42:00.169
No.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.128
That's the girl you were
talking about, down in P-Town?

42:02.258 --> 42:03.825
Yeah.

42:03.956 --> 42:06.698
You think Frankie had
something to do with it?

42:06.828 --> 42:08.656
'Cause he wouldn't.

42:08.787 --> 42:09.962
He would never do that
to a girl.

42:10.092 --> 42:13.313
Hey, that's not
what I'm saying.

42:13.443 --> 42:15.881
Your man's locked up
right now, right?

42:16.011 --> 42:17.578
So I know it wasn't him.

42:17.709 --> 42:20.015
But we're looking
at people he worked with,

42:20.146 --> 42:22.148
maybe someone
who's trying to impress him.

42:28.676 --> 42:31.461
You see, Sherry
was cooperating with us.

42:31.592 --> 42:33.420
Jesus.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.336
That's fucked up.

42:39.905 --> 42:41.820
I don't want to jam you up
for that thing last night,
but I need something.

42:43.952 --> 42:46.868
So we know Frankie
didn't kill her,
but someone did.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.478
Who's the first person
that comes to your mind?

42:51.133 --> 42:53.614
Just say it.

42:53.745 --> 42:55.921
I don't even know his name,

42:56.051 --> 42:58.271
but there's--there's this guy,

42:58.358 --> 43:00.186
and he's, like...

43:00.316 --> 43:02.492
He's, like, huge.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.843
- Huge fat or huge tall?
- Both.

43:04.973 --> 43:06.584
Um...

43:06.714 --> 43:08.194
he's black.

43:08.324 --> 43:10.805
I think he's...
he's from somewhere else.

43:10.936 --> 43:12.633
Dominican Republic?
Haiti?

43:12.764 --> 43:15.244
I don't know.
I...

43:15.375 --> 43:17.943
met him once, and...

43:18.073 --> 43:18.944
I know he has a gun.

43:19.074 --> 43:20.119
He live on the Cape?

43:20.249 --> 43:21.207
I said I met the guy once.

43:21.337 --> 43:22.687
I don't know where he lives.

43:25.515 --> 43:28.301
Look, you can keep
asking me questions,
but I don't know anything.

43:28.431 --> 43:30.172
No, it's okay.
That's good.

43:30.259 --> 43:32.087
Thank you.

43:32.174 --> 43:34.394
This is secret, right?
Like, no one's...

43:34.524 --> 43:36.396
No one's gonna find out
I was talking to you.

43:36.526 --> 43:39.399
Nobody.

43:39.529 --> 43:41.053
It's between me and you,
I promise.

43:41.183 --> 43:42.837
And, hey, Renee,

43:42.968 --> 43:44.230
as far as I'm concerned,
we're square now.

43:47.581 --> 43:49.148
Can I ask you something?

43:49.278 --> 43:51.411
I mean, do--do you mind
if I come by another time?

43:51.541 --> 43:55.110
Not to...

43:55.241 --> 43:57.112
Maybe we just play some ball
or something.

43:57.243 --> 43:58.592
Whatever you need.

44:01.769 --> 44:04.729
Yeah, okay.

44:04.859 --> 44:06.948
Okay.

44:13.476 --> 44:14.608
See you later, Frankie!

44:14.739 --> 44:17.045
Okay. Bye.

44:26.838 --> 44:28.491
You want to leave your phone
with me?

44:28.622 --> 44:31.059
It's not allowed.

44:31.190 --> 44:32.757
Fuck that.

44:35.411 --> 44:36.978
You can't do anything
the easy way, can you?

44:37.109 --> 44:38.676
Oh, whatever.

44:41.026 --> 44:43.289
But, seriously, Ed,

44:43.419 --> 44:44.725
thank you.

44:44.856 --> 44:46.858
Come on, now.

44:46.988 --> 44:48.860
Don't go soft on me.

44:48.990 --> 44:50.557
Yeah, for real, though,

44:50.688 --> 44:53.647
you're a really good partner.

44:53.778 --> 44:56.258
I'm gonna make you, like,
my emergency contact
and everything.

44:56.389 --> 44:59.087
Jesus.
That's depressing.

44:59.218 --> 45:02.003
I'm all you got?

45:02.134 --> 45:04.049
I'm gonna fucking kill
myself now.

45:04.179 --> 45:05.485
Yeah, yeah.

45:25.200 --> 45:28.203
No, move him out of detox
into extended care.

45:29.814 --> 45:31.903
Well, exactly.
We don't have room.

45:32.033 --> 45:34.427
And--and tell Marcy.

45:36.516 --> 45:38.387
Sorry about that.
Crazy day.

45:40.650 --> 45:42.435
I'm Dr. Larkin.

45:42.565 --> 45:43.828
Hi.

45:43.958 --> 45:47.222
And you are
Jackie...Key-no-nes?

45:47.353 --> 45:48.484
Yeah, close enough.

45:48.615 --> 45:50.835
So, um...

45:50.965 --> 45:54.839
what's the shortest time
I can stay here?

45:54.969 --> 45:57.189
Well, we offer
a three-day detox,

45:57.319 --> 45:58.581
but you have good insurance.

45:58.712 --> 45:59.887
I recommend you stay longer.

46:00.018 --> 46:03.848
No, three days is fine, thanks.

46:03.978 --> 46:06.198
Okay.

46:06.328 --> 46:07.765
Tell me why you're here.

46:09.854 --> 46:12.770
Uh...

46:12.900 --> 46:15.903
I was in
a car accident.

46:16.034 --> 46:17.557
You were drinking?

46:19.515 --> 46:21.648
Yeah, a little...

46:21.735 --> 46:23.781
and a little coke, but they
don't really know about that.

46:27.001 --> 46:29.699
You're being charged
with a DUI?

46:29.787 --> 46:32.050
Misdemeanor or felony?

46:32.137 --> 46:36.315
Um, they haven't charged me
yet, so...

46:36.445 --> 46:38.186
But probably a felony.

46:41.102 --> 46:42.234
Do you think you have
a drug and alcohol problem?

46:42.321 --> 46:43.148
No.

46:44.497 --> 46:45.759
No, I do not.

46:45.890 --> 46:47.587
I like to party
a little, but...

46:47.717 --> 46:49.371
no.

46:50.285 --> 46:52.418
Then I'll ask you again
why you're here.

46:54.812 --> 46:57.640
Because the lawyer told me
it was a good idea, all right?

46:57.771 --> 47:00.948
Keep me out of jail.

47:01.079 --> 47:04.169
Well, that's pretty good
motivation to sober up.

47:04.299 --> 47:06.084
You think you can do it
without treatment?

47:06.214 --> 47:07.868
Yeah.

47:07.999 --> 47:10.044
Yes, yeah, is that--
is that an option?

47:10.175 --> 47:12.220
Sure.
Go.

47:14.309 --> 47:15.789
What?

47:15.920 --> 47:17.878
It's not my job
to convince you to stay,

47:18.009 --> 47:20.185
and, frankly, my niece
just got her learner's permit.

47:20.315 --> 47:22.840
I might actually prefer
you go to prison.

47:22.970 --> 47:26.408
That's rude.

47:26.539 --> 47:28.671
It's rude to drive drunk.

47:35.069 --> 47:38.290
You know I found
a dead body yesterday?

47:38.420 --> 47:39.421
No, I didn't know.

47:39.552 --> 47:42.120
Yeah.

47:42.250 --> 47:44.513
Some chick--she just washed up
on the beach.

47:44.644 --> 47:46.298
Drug thing, I guess.

47:46.428 --> 47:48.300
It's like...

47:48.430 --> 47:50.868
damn, these white girls
love trouble.

47:55.785 --> 47:57.831
That was a scary,
violent thing you saw.

47:57.962 --> 47:59.746
Why are you acting like you
don't have feelings about it?

48:01.095 --> 48:02.314
Because I don't.

48:05.273 --> 48:06.535
Okay.

48:08.233 --> 48:09.364
Let's talk
about the car accident.

48:09.495 --> 48:10.888
Was anyone hurt?

48:11.018 --> 48:12.585
You just dig right in,
don't you?

48:12.715 --> 48:14.413
It wasn't a dig,

48:14.500 --> 48:16.676
but I'm sorry
if it felt like one.

48:16.806 --> 48:19.374
You're not sorry.
You're not fucking sorry.

48:19.505 --> 48:22.638
You want me to cry and tell you
what a piece of shit I am
or whatever.

48:22.769 --> 48:23.726
Isn't that how this works?

48:23.857 --> 48:25.728
No.

48:25.859 --> 48:26.947
We just talk.

48:27.078 --> 48:28.993
Fuck talking, all right?

48:29.123 --> 48:31.125
I don't need to talk
because I'm fine.

48:31.256 --> 48:33.954
Jesus.
I'm--I-I have an amazing life.

48:34.085 --> 48:36.696
I live in Provincetown,
for crying out loud.

48:36.826 --> 48:39.786
It's like fucking lesbian
Shangri-La, all right?

48:39.917 --> 48:41.309
I mean, so what?

48:41.440 --> 48:42.702
I like to party a little.
Everyone does.

48:42.832 --> 48:44.747
But it's P-Town.

48:44.878 --> 48:47.402
In P-Town, you're either
a fisherman
or gay on vacation,

48:47.489 --> 48:48.751
and either way, they party,
all right?

48:48.882 --> 48:50.536
Everyone parties.

48:50.666 --> 48:53.278
Everyone parties like me,
so it's fine, okay?

48:55.541 --> 48:56.934
I'm fine.

49:05.246 --> 49:07.901
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

49:11.470 --> 49:14.038
Jesus, I don't--
I'm not sure why I'm crying.

49:20.696 --> 49:23.525
So look...

49:23.612 --> 49:25.875
there's an AA meeting
at 4:00 in the gathering hall.

49:29.444 --> 49:31.142
You want to settle in
to your room first,

49:31.272 --> 49:32.578
or you want to go
straight there?

49:37.104 --> 49:39.759
You're letting me stay?

49:52.511 --> 49:54.687
- Hey.

49:54.817 --> 49:56.732
- What's going on?
- Hi.

49:56.863 --> 49:58.386
So I talked
to Frankie's baby mama.

49:58.473 --> 50:00.214
- Uh-huh.
- She gave me
a description of--

50:00.301 --> 50:02.434
and this is quote un-quote--
a huge black male
from somewhere else.

50:02.564 --> 50:04.218
That narrows it down.

50:04.349 --> 50:06.699
So I'm thinking
Dominican, Haitian,

50:06.829 --> 50:08.396
maybe one of your peeps.

50:08.527 --> 50:10.311
Haitian guy? Oh, hell!
Maybe I know him already.

50:10.442 --> 50:12.531
All right.
Do me a favor, though.

50:12.661 --> 50:13.749
Get in touch with BOP,

50:13.880 --> 50:15.664
Immigration,
any CIs you have.

50:15.795 --> 50:18.493
I just want to shake something loose on this guy.

50:18.624 --> 50:19.712
You think she's being straight
with you, Ray?

50:19.799 --> 50:20.930
I don't know.

50:21.757 --> 50:23.585
I jammed her up
pretty good, though.

50:24.499 --> 50:25.718
- You miss me?

50:25.848 --> 50:27.328
Yes, Daddy.

50:27.459 --> 50:29.809
So, listen, we haven't talked
in a while.

50:29.896 --> 50:31.202
What's your favorite ice cream?

50:31.332 --> 50:33.204
- Strawberry.
- Strawberry is your favorite?

50:33.334 --> 50:35.597
- Mmm.
- Remember what Daddy was?

50:35.728 --> 50:37.338
- Coconut.
- Coconut, muy bien.

50:39.297 --> 50:40.124
You're awesome.
You been good for Mommy?

50:40.254 --> 50:41.473
Yes.

50:41.603 --> 50:42.996
You want to go play
with those kids?

50:43.127 --> 50:45.303
- Yes, Daddy.
- Okay, go.

50:56.966 --> 50:58.881
I miss you.

51:10.589 --> 51:11.807
Look at me.

51:15.811 --> 51:18.205
I need to know...

51:18.292 --> 51:19.772
if any cop's
been coming around.

51:22.340 --> 51:25.082
Yeah.

51:25.169 --> 51:26.692
One came by the club
last night.

51:28.563 --> 51:30.913
Who?

51:31.044 --> 51:33.786
Ray something.

51:33.916 --> 51:36.745
Said he was a State Police.

51:36.832 --> 51:39.008
Kept asking about some girl
down in P-Town.

51:41.010 --> 51:42.838
I didn't say shit,
I swear.

51:44.884 --> 51:47.191
I know you didn't.

51:52.413 --> 51:54.763
But here's the thing.

51:54.894 --> 51:58.811
He comes back around...

51:58.941 --> 52:01.335
I want you to get close.

52:10.344 --> 52:12.651
We were a totally
normal family.

52:12.781 --> 52:15.741
Two parents, two kids.

52:15.871 --> 52:19.005
And I-I was a good kid
for a long time.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.530
I-I think my--my first drink,

52:22.661 --> 52:25.925
I was, like, 14.

52:26.012 --> 52:28.536
Um, my friend Gina

52:28.623 --> 52:30.190
steals a bottle of rum
from her parents,

52:30.277 --> 52:32.845
and we sneak it up
to the attic,

52:32.975 --> 52:35.108
and it's fucking gross.

52:37.197 --> 52:38.633
And--and Gina's like,

52:38.720 --> 52:41.462
"Ew, sick! Agh!"

52:41.593 --> 52:43.682
But...

52:43.769 --> 52:47.294
I'm all like,
"Holy shit"...

52:47.425 --> 52:49.775
like this is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

52:52.343 --> 52:56.042
Because right away,
I just fucking know

52:56.173 --> 52:58.262
that this is the shit
I want to be doing
for the rest of my life.

53:00.089 --> 53:03.571
Like, it just works for me.

53:05.356 --> 53:08.228
I mean, it turns out,

53:08.359 --> 53:10.056
three Oxys and two benzos
work even better.

53:10.187 --> 53:11.449
You know what I mean?

53:13.581 --> 53:16.541
But nothing I ever found...

53:16.671 --> 53:18.673
works better

53:18.804 --> 53:20.762
than the program
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

53:27.987 --> 53:29.423
No, I can't call the cops.

53:31.512 --> 53:33.732
I saw a fucking murder.

53:33.819 --> 53:35.168
These people will kill me.
I...

53:38.476 --> 53:40.173
Yes, yes, I'm clean.

53:40.304 --> 53:41.870
I swear. I...

53:42.001 --> 53:43.307
I just need to get off
the Cape.

53:43.437 --> 53:45.004
I have none of my shit
with me.

53:45.091 --> 53:47.876
I--this is, like,
a 7-Eleven phone.

53:48.007 --> 53:49.748
You're the only number
I know by heart.

53:49.878 --> 53:51.271
Please, please.

53:51.402 --> 53:53.534
Can you please just come
pick me up?

53:56.929 --> 53:58.322
Hey!

54:00.106 --> 54:03.109
You got time to lean,
you got time to clean.

54:03.196 --> 54:04.980
Aye, Captain.

55:52.349 --> 55:53.262
My name's Jackie Quinones.

55:54.786 --> 55:55.656
Ah.

55:57.832 --> 55:58.920
Fish cop.

56:03.490 --> 56:04.665
You hear anything else about
that dead girl?

56:04.752 --> 56:05.884
No.

56:06.014 --> 56:07.233
You got played.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.452
Take my advice
and step off.

56:08.582 --> 56:10.454
Hey this is whack,
you giving me advice.

56:10.584 --> 56:11.716
Tell me what you want.

56:11.846 --> 56:14.196
You're trying to get me
to convince you to do

56:14.327 --> 56:16.155
something you want to do.

56:17.548 --> 56:19.245
It's a homicide investigation,
you have to let us handle it.

56:19.854 --> 56:21.334
I'm in law enforcement.

56:21.465 --> 56:22.596
-No.
-Get on the ground!

56:22.683 --> 56:23.815
You're not.

56:24.555 --> 56:26.644
Maybe my purpose is to save
this girl.

56:28.036 --> 56:29.342
You are so far in over
your head.

56:29.473 --> 56:31.388
Tell me what I'm
supposed to do.

56:34.391 --> 56:36.001
They find out you're the
girl asking questions,

56:36.523 --> 56:37.568
they will kill you.

56:40.092 --> 56:41.223
You wanted to be a part of this.

56:43.878 --> 56:45.184
Now I can't remember why.

56:46.098 --> 56:47.665
You've just watched the early
premiere of Hightown.

56:47.752 --> 56:49.493
See an all new episode May 24th.
