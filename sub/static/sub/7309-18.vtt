WEBVTT

00:14.200 --> 00:17.500
Corporal Liam Michael O'Neill.

00:17.535 --> 00:19.767
That's a good Irish name.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.965
I'm from Scotland, myself.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.600
I hope you won't hold that against me.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.265
24 years old.

00:27.300 --> 00:31.600
Too young for us to be
meeting on this chilly morning.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.965
United States Marine Corps;

00:34.000 --> 00:38.300
Found facedown in a
snowdrift in Montrose Park?!

00:38.900 --> 00:41.300
Now, how did you end up there

00:41.900 --> 00:44.165
at 6:00 in the morning?

00:44.200 --> 00:49.000
Not stumbling home from
a big night out, I trust.

00:49.035 --> 00:53.800
Now, that would be a tragic
waste of a young life.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.950
This is the place where death

00:57.985 --> 01:01.200
rejoices in teaching the living.

01:04.599 --> 01:08.200
Liam, what can you teach us?

01:14.700 --> 01:15.900
Oh.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.800
A wee bump.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.101
Well, perhaps I spoke too soon.

01:21.898 --> 01:24.100
Perhaps you weren't the architect

01:24.700 --> 01:26.500
of your own destruction.

02:20.994 --> 02:22.894
There is nothing lucky about waking up

02:22.929 --> 02:24.994
during your own autopsy, probie.

02:25.894 --> 02:27.194
Least you know you're not dead.

02:27.894 --> 02:29.494
Ducky's the one who's lucky.

02:30.094 --> 02:31.494
Why is Ducky lucky?

02:31.594 --> 02:34.244
Well, well, look who's finally here.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.859
Ooh! Like you've never been late,

02:36.894 --> 02:39.494
left early, or gone
mysteriously missing?

02:39.529 --> 02:41.011
Oh, no. That's my point exactly.

02:41.046 --> 02:42.770
Tardiness is my middle name.

02:42.805 --> 02:44.459
In fact, it's expected of me.

02:44.494 --> 02:47.994
You, on the other hand, have become
the poster girl for punctuality.

02:49.494 --> 02:50.359
Late night?

02:50.394 --> 02:51.694
Early morning. Run.

02:51.729 --> 02:52.659
New route.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.094
Took longer than I expected.

02:54.129 --> 02:55.661
Will run faster tomorrow.

02:55.696 --> 02:57.395
Now, why is Ducky lucky?

02:57.430 --> 02:59.094
We found a dead man walking.

03:00.594 --> 03:02.694
I've had enough of dead men walking.

03:02.729 --> 03:04.594
Uh, this one was really dead.

03:04.794 --> 03:06.794
Ducky was about to start the autopsy,

03:06.829 --> 03:08.794
and he came back to life.

03:08.829 --> 03:10.194
Like Lazarus.

03:10.494 --> 03:11.794
No, like Liam.

03:12.094 --> 03:14.194
Liam O'Neill. Corporal.

03:14.294 --> 03:17.394
He was a communication
specialist attached to a Marine

03:17.429 --> 03:20.494
supply division combat
support hospital in Baghdad.

03:20.529 --> 03:23.294
On a 15-day leave
from his unit in Iraq.

03:23.594 --> 03:24.659
Third tour.

03:24.694 --> 03:26.194
Hardcore Marine.

03:26.394 --> 03:28.794
Due to fly back to
Baghdad day after tomorrow.

03:28.829 --> 03:29.559
How does a man

03:29.594 --> 03:32.794
who is not dead end up
on Ducky's autopsy table?

03:34.794 --> 03:36.194
It was the Metro police.

03:36.229 --> 03:37.961
They reported a dead man,

03:37.996 --> 03:39.659
not an unconscious one.

03:39.694 --> 03:42.544
You know, there's an
old paramedic's saying.

03:42.579 --> 03:45.394
They're not dead until
they're wormed and dead.

03:45.594 --> 03:47.544
Can't really blame them.

03:47.579 --> 03:49.494
Facedown in a snowdrift,

03:49.694 --> 03:52.594
core temperature 20
degrees below normal.

03:52.629 --> 03:55.059
No discernible heartbeat.

03:55.094 --> 03:57.244
Could have been there for hours.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.394
It's not an unreasonable conclusion,

03:59.429 --> 04:00.794
under the circumstances.

04:00.829 --> 04:01.994
CPR.

04:02.194 --> 04:04.894
By their estimation, he was long dead.

04:04.929 --> 04:07.594
CPR is for the recent dead.

04:08.094 --> 04:09.559
Never crossed their minds.

04:09.594 --> 04:12.994
You know, the physiology
is very interesting.

04:13.029 --> 04:14.994
Faced with imminent death,

04:15.029 --> 04:16.858
the brain begins

04:16.894 --> 04:19.244
to switch off the lights to preserve

04:19.279 --> 04:21.594
the last flicker of life and hope.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.059
Prognosis?

04:23.094 --> 04:27.094
Well, children have been
known to make a full recovery

04:27.129 --> 04:30.194
after being pulled from
freezing rivers, ooh,

04:30.229 --> 04:33.494
two hours after they apparently drowned.

04:34.094 --> 04:36.094
Adults are rarely so lucky.

04:36.129 --> 04:38.059
He... He'll be on a ventilato

04:38.094 --> 04:41.794
and the hospital will
constantly check his condition.

04:41.894 --> 04:43.494
Got nothing for us here, Duck.

04:43.529 --> 04:45.094
Oh, on the contrary.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.394
He had a lump

04:47.494 --> 04:49.959
on his left temporal area.

04:49.994 --> 04:53.294
And bruising on the back
and sides of his neck.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.459
He didn't fall into that snowdrift.

04:55.494 --> 04:57.894
No, he was strucked on
the side of the head.

04:57.929 --> 05:01.694
His face was pushed into the snow,

05:01.894 --> 05:05.694
violently held by his neck
and the back of the head.

05:05.794 --> 05:08.094
Probably until he stopped thrashing.

05:09.294 --> 05:11.294
How's that for starters?

05:15.594 --> 05:16.894
Not much to see.

05:17.594 --> 05:19.094
I wouldn't say that.

05:22.494 --> 05:23.659
He sure calls her a lot.

05:23.694 --> 05:26.294
Oh, well, she calls him
more often than he calls her.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.294
Meaning?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.094
Commitment issues.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.494
She is; He's not.

05:33.294 --> 05:34.594
What time?

05:34.994 --> 05:37.394
Okay, you gonna give me a clue

05:37.429 --> 05:39.294
about this mystery date?

05:40.394 --> 05:42.594
Jeanne, "gym shoes" is not a clue.

05:42.794 --> 05:44.044
"Naked" is a clue.

05:44.079 --> 05:45.294
You want me naked?

05:45.794 --> 05:48.194
All right. You don't
want to see me naked?

05:49.194 --> 05:50.194
All right.

05:50.394 --> 05:52.294
I'll bring the gym shoes.

05:52.494 --> 05:53.494
Bye.

05:54.894 --> 05:56.694
Glad you could join us.

05:57.794 --> 05:59.494
Well, there's not much to see.

05:59.529 --> 06:00.594
Appreciate it.

06:03.494 --> 06:05.505
Corporal O'Neill was wearing
a light shirt and no jacket.

06:05.529 --> 06:06.994
What's that tell you, McGee?

06:07.294 --> 06:08.744
Jacket was stolen?

06:08.779 --> 06:10.194
Or he left it close by.

06:10.694 --> 06:12.194
Or some place warm.

06:13.294 --> 06:14.644
There's no houses nearby.

06:14.679 --> 06:15.994
Service road's close, though.

06:16.694 --> 06:17.794
Car.

06:19.594 --> 06:21.159
Silver '97 Mustang.

06:21.194 --> 06:25.194
License plate Delta
Zulu-one-five Lima-three-seven.

06:27.494 --> 06:28.794
McGEE: Bingo on the jacket.

06:37.194 --> 06:38.694
McGEE: Motive wasn't robbery.

06:38.994 --> 06:40.594
Sequentially-numbered bills.

06:40.794 --> 06:43.594
Freshly minted - $500.

06:43.894 --> 06:45.794
Heater is set high, ignition is on.

06:45.829 --> 06:47.694
Must have sat there
with the engine running.

06:47.729 --> 06:48.959
Guess he left in a hurry.

06:48.994 --> 06:51.094
Well, he didn't leave fast enough.

06:53.194 --> 06:54.694
Good afternoon, Gibbs.

06:55.194 --> 06:56.544
Well, afternoon, Abs.

06:56.579 --> 06:57.894
How'd you know it was me?

06:57.994 --> 06:59.359
Because I found something,

06:59.394 --> 07:01.105
and whenever I find
something, you always know,

07:01.129 --> 07:03.359
and then you come see me. I do?

07:03.394 --> 07:05.594
Well, yeah. If I didn't,
then you wouldn't be here.

07:05.794 --> 07:06.805
Haven't you been listening?

07:06.829 --> 07:07.994
You found what, Abs?

07:09.994 --> 07:10.859
This.

07:10.894 --> 07:12.794
In his left trouser pocket.

07:12.994 --> 07:14.844
- It's organic.
- Illegal?

07:14.879 --> 07:16.694
We could smoke it and find out.

07:17.094 --> 07:19.894
Kidding. I'm gonna let
the mass spec smoke that,

07:19.929 --> 07:21.059
but I also found this...

07:21.094 --> 07:23.494
a receipt from a restaurant in Baghdad.

07:23.894 --> 07:25.494
Corporal's on his third tour, Abs.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.559
But he's been on leave

07:26.594 --> 07:28.794
for three weeks, so what was he doing

07:28.829 --> 07:30.594
in Baghdad three days ago?

07:30.794 --> 07:31.659
See the date?

07:31.694 --> 07:33.544
I think he had a falafel.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.394
That's a good catch, Abby.

07:35.694 --> 07:37.059
Do you think it's ESP?

07:37.094 --> 07:39.194
I mean, that you always
know when I find something?

07:39.229 --> 07:40.259
And if it is ESP,

07:40.294 --> 07:41.359
are you reading my mind,

07:41.394 --> 07:44.094
or am I sending you some
sort of weird brain thoughts

07:44.129 --> 07:46.094
out of my head and into yours?

07:48.294 --> 07:50.794
Come back, Gibbs.

07:50.829 --> 07:53.294
Come back... Gibbs.

07:56.294 --> 07:57.894
Boss, we got it.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.659
Cross-checked it with ICE.

07:59.694 --> 08:01.894
O'Neill left the country eight days ago,

08:01.929 --> 08:03.159
using his own passport.

08:03.194 --> 08:04.894
He was traveling as a private citizen.

08:04.994 --> 08:06.994
Arrived back in the
country two days ago.

08:07.029 --> 08:07.859
A record of travel?

08:07.894 --> 08:08.994
McGEE: Direct to Frankfurt,

08:09.029 --> 08:10.111
then on to Baghdad.

08:10.146 --> 08:11.159
Came back the same way.

08:11.194 --> 08:13.570
Wouldn't call Baghdad one of
your top ten tourist destinations.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.105
Yeah, especially if you've just come
from there and you're going back.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.894
And people are shooting at
you. Or trying to blow you up.

08:18.994 --> 08:19.859
Airline?

08:19.894 --> 08:20.994
Uh, didn't fly commercial.

08:21.029 --> 08:22.059
He flew there and back

08:22.094 --> 08:24.644
with an air freight
company called -Fast Flight-

08:24.679 --> 08:27.194
Operates out of a warehouse
near Dulles airport.

08:27.229 --> 08:28.494
Address.

08:28.694 --> 08:29.694
Ziva.

08:30.694 --> 08:32.794
The landing fees are a rip-off. They...

08:34.394 --> 08:35.693
Damascus, then.

08:38.094 --> 08:39.894
Well, what about Cairo?

08:40.294 --> 08:43.005
Look, you're just gonna have to find
me a better gas station right now,

08:43.029 --> 08:45.459
or I'm gonna have to push that
damn plane all the way home.

08:45.494 --> 08:47.205
MAN I'll find you something,
Taylor, don't sweat it.

08:47.229 --> 08:48.494
You do that.

08:50.194 --> 08:51.194
Who are you?

08:51.594 --> 08:52.694
Federal agents.

08:53.894 --> 08:55.094
NTSB?

08:56.094 --> 08:57.394
NCIS.

08:59.294 --> 09:01.994
Right. Gotta love those acronyms.

09:02.094 --> 09:03.794
Maybe that's what this company needs.

09:03.829 --> 09:06.094
Huh? An acronym.

09:07.394 --> 09:08.994
Bad day, Mr. Taylor?

09:09.894 --> 09:11.594
Guess that depends on what you want.

09:11.794 --> 09:12.794
Excuse me.

09:13.194 --> 09:14.259
Liam O'Neill?

09:14.294 --> 09:16.894
You flew him to Baghdad
and back this week.

09:16.994 --> 09:18.094
All legal.

09:18.194 --> 09:20.494
Had a passport, cleared
Customs, filed the paperwork.

09:20.529 --> 09:21.994
Why did he fly with you?

09:24.794 --> 09:27.259
Fast Flight. Oh.

09:27.294 --> 09:29.594
FF - there's an acronym for you.

09:29.629 --> 09:31.394
Stands for Free Flights.

09:31.794 --> 09:33.294
You flew him free of charge?

09:33.329 --> 09:34.559
Ex-Royal Air Force,

09:34.594 --> 09:37.194
doing a good deed for a serving Marine.

09:37.394 --> 09:39.994
Don't get a lot of people
hitching a ride to Baghdad.

09:40.294 --> 09:41.944
Why was he going to Baghdad?

09:41.979 --> 09:43.594
Uh, said he was on leave.

09:44.094 --> 09:45.894
He just found out his unit had been hit.

09:45.929 --> 09:47.694
One of his buddies was wounded.

09:48.494 --> 09:49.594
Wanted to see him.

09:50.294 --> 09:51.394
What's he done?

09:51.694 --> 09:53.094
Someone tried to kill him.

09:56.194 --> 09:57.394
Is he gonna be okay?

09:57.429 --> 09:57.959
Maybe.

09:57.994 --> 09:59.494
Something you want to add?

10:02.494 --> 10:06.494
Some guys met him outside
Baghdad International Airport.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.044
What guys?

10:11.079 --> 10:12.079
Yes?

10:12.994 --> 10:14.494
B.A.G.'s.

10:15.394 --> 10:18.294
"Bad Ass Guys." With guns.

10:19.194 --> 10:20.794
Plenty of them in Baghdad.

10:21.394 --> 10:23.294
You ask him about it on the flight home?

10:23.694 --> 10:25.594
Wasn't very talkative.

10:26.094 --> 10:27.794
His buddy didn't make it.

10:28.994 --> 10:31.594
Someone's with Corporal
O'Neill at the hospital.

10:32.894 --> 10:33.859
Next of kin?

10:33.894 --> 10:36.294
He has no next of kin.

10:47.694 --> 10:49.194
Hello, probie.

10:50.194 --> 10:51.194
Hello, Mike.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.594
You know this Marine?

10:57.294 --> 10:59.494
He's my son...

11:12.802 --> 11:15.202
Here you go. Black, no sugar.

11:16.402 --> 11:17.402
Thanks.

11:22.302 --> 11:24.202
You never told me you had a son.

11:26.402 --> 11:29.202
Didn't find out till
a couple of years ago.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.402
Got a phone call one day.

11:32.902 --> 11:34.302
It was him.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.202
He tracked me down.

11:37.102 --> 11:40.002
We met, had a few beers.

11:40.302 --> 11:42.602
He was just about to deploy.

11:44.802 --> 11:48.402
Didn't hear from him again
until a couple of days ago.

11:49.202 --> 11:50.902
Said he was in trouble.

11:51.102 --> 11:52.502
What kind of trouble?

11:53.502 --> 11:54.902
Didn't say.

12:00.402 --> 12:01.567
You wouldn't know it now,

12:01.602 --> 12:05.202
but he's got his mother's hair.

12:06.802 --> 12:10.102
Used to blow across her
face and get in her eyes.

12:10.137 --> 12:13.702
She'd get so pissed and I'd laugh.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.002
She died a few years ago.

12:19.902 --> 12:22.502
We were only together six months.

12:22.602 --> 12:25.602
Didn't even know she was
pregnant when she left.

12:26.802 --> 12:28.702
What do the doctors say?

12:29.302 --> 12:31.567
What doctors always say.

12:31.602 --> 12:34.402
Not much that makes any sense.

12:34.802 --> 12:36.902
Doing tests.

12:37.302 --> 12:39.167
Brainwaves and...

12:39.202 --> 12:43.202
reflexes, all that neurological stuff.

12:45.502 --> 12:47.802
You know who did this, probie?

12:47.902 --> 12:48.902
Not yet.

12:50.702 --> 12:53.202
Guess you wouldn't tell me if you did.

12:54.502 --> 12:55.702
No.

13:00.602 --> 13:02.402
Need a place to stay tonight, Mike?

13:03.302 --> 13:05.002
Might just stay here

13:05.302 --> 13:07.202
with my boy.

13:18.602 --> 13:19.667
Are there any hope?

13:19.702 --> 13:21.767
As I was just explaining
to your colleague,

13:21.802 --> 13:24.802
the patient is unresponsive
to external stimulin.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.602
His name is Corporal O'Neill.

13:27.002 --> 13:28.502
Corporal O'Neill.

13:29.402 --> 13:31.902
There's still more testing
to do, which will determine

13:31.937 --> 13:34.502
if there is any cerebral
circulation present,

13:34.602 --> 13:38.502
but at this point, it would
be wrong to offer any hope.

13:38.702 --> 13:40.102
When will you know for certain?

13:40.402 --> 13:41.667
Tomorrow.

13:41.702 --> 13:42.502
Thank you.

13:42.602 --> 13:44.502
Sure.

13:52.802 --> 13:53.902
He knows?

13:55.502 --> 13:56.502
He knew.

14:01.702 --> 14:03.102
Didn't I say gym shoes?

14:03.137 --> 14:04.502
TONY Ah, yeah.

14:05.002 --> 14:07.302
Well, you know me, always
following doctor's orders.

14:07.337 --> 14:08.802
You ever climb one of these before?

14:08.837 --> 14:09.837
No.

14:10.102 --> 14:11.267
Nervous?

14:11.302 --> 14:14.402
- Should I be?
- Well, it's a long way up.

14:14.702 --> 14:16.502
Ah, yes, it is, and once you're up,

14:16.537 --> 14:17.802
it's a long way down.

14:18.102 --> 14:19.602
Oh, you're all strapped in.

14:19.637 --> 14:20.637
You'll be fine.

14:21.602 --> 14:22.602
Oh.

14:23.602 --> 14:24.702
Can you please let that go?

14:24.737 --> 14:26.702
Okay. Thank you.

14:28.002 --> 14:30.502
I'll be climbing beside
you. Let me just...

14:30.537 --> 14:32.802
Okay. Mm - good look for you.

14:34.302 --> 14:35.367
Okay...

14:35.402 --> 14:36.802
Is this going to be a race?

14:37.002 --> 14:37.567
No.

14:37.602 --> 14:39.402
Speed climbing is for the experts.

14:39.437 --> 14:41.302
Experts like you.

14:47.102 --> 14:48.802
When you're ready.

14:50.702 --> 14:51.702
Ha... Okay.

15:03.902 --> 15:05.267
Ha, ha, ha.

15:05.302 --> 15:07.302
So what do I get if
I beat you to the top?

15:07.402 --> 15:09.102
You get to tell me you love me.

15:09.502 --> 15:11.002
And if I don't beat you?

15:11.802 --> 15:13.902
You still get to tell me you love me.

15:14.302 --> 15:17.902
So, is that followed by
other physical pursuits?

15:18.602 --> 15:20.202
If you're not too tired.

15:20.237 --> 15:21.302
Oh...

15:21.602 --> 15:22.952
I'm never too tired.

15:22.987 --> 15:24.302
Hey, wait.

15:30.502 --> 15:31.467
Cheater!

15:31.502 --> 15:34.002
You told me you'd never climbed before.

15:34.802 --> 15:37.502
No, I said I'd never climbed
one of these before-ha-hee.

15:41.502 --> 15:42.702
Oh, I'm gonna beat you.

15:43.402 --> 15:44.802
And I'm there.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.902
- You're good.
- You're better.

15:50.402 --> 15:52.702
How can I ever trust you again?

15:53.402 --> 15:55.002
Where did you learn to climb?

15:55.102 --> 15:57.202
There was this big, old
pine tree in my backyard.

15:57.237 --> 15:59.069
It was about three times higher

15:59.104 --> 16:00.867
than we are now, and I used

16:00.902 --> 16:03.302
to climb it all the
way to the tippity-top.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.802
One day, I refused to come down.

16:05.502 --> 16:07.002
And my mom

16:07.202 --> 16:08.702
called the fire department.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.502
Why didn't you want to come down?

16:12.502 --> 16:14.502
The view was too beautiful.

16:15.402 --> 16:17.002
Just like it is now.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.002
You beat me to the top.

16:35.102 --> 16:36.502
You know what that means.

16:38.102 --> 16:39.902
Other physical pursuits?

16:43.302 --> 16:44.702
Last one down's on top.

16:51.402 --> 16:53.502
It's just so sad, you know?

16:53.702 --> 16:55.102
You have a son you never knew about

16:55.137 --> 16:57.169
for all those years, and then

16:57.204 --> 16:59.202
right when you find out... ugh...

16:59.302 --> 17:00.902
It doesn't seem fair.

17:01.402 --> 17:03.702
Maybe you should call
all your old girlfriends,

17:03.737 --> 17:05.502
you know, just to check.

17:06.202 --> 17:07.502
That won't take long.

17:07.702 --> 17:09.666
What I mean is, uh, I can't imagine

17:09.702 --> 17:11.801
any of them having a
baby without telling me.

17:12.402 --> 17:13.801
Now, Tony, on the other hand...

17:16.402 --> 17:18.202
Last ten numbers called and received.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.801
And voice mail.

17:22.002 --> 17:23.002
Great.

17:23.902 --> 17:25.902
Voice mail's protected by a PIN number.

17:25.936 --> 17:27.702
That's going to take some time.

17:28.902 --> 17:31.902
Okay... a bunch of
international calls...

17:32.102 --> 17:34.267
Prefix 964

17:34.302 --> 17:35.967
that's Iraq's country code.

17:36.002 --> 17:39.102
Five calls back and
forth to Fast Flight...

17:39.137 --> 17:40.267
Second-to-last dialed

17:40.302 --> 17:42.802
and second-to-last received
are the same number.

17:43.102 --> 17:44.567
The name of...

17:44.602 --> 17:46.102
"Pagoda Investments."

17:47.202 --> 17:49.602
Well, looks like we
might have a money trail..

17:52.902 --> 17:55.602
Company is owned by Jalil Shaloub.

17:55.702 --> 17:57.667
Known to his friends
and enemies as "Jimmy."

17:57.702 --> 18:01.002
Small-time investment
advisor, big-time loan shark.

18:01.037 --> 18:03.302
Also on Homeland Security's watch list.

18:03.337 --> 18:05.067
Iraqi father, Lebanese mother.

18:05.102 --> 18:06.702
Moved here after the first Gulf War.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.202
Any active surveillance?

18:08.302 --> 18:10.302
None that anyone is admitting to.

18:10.402 --> 18:12.267
Shaloub channels money into

18:12.302 --> 18:15.902
a Beirut investment bank, which
may or may not support Hezbollah.

18:15.937 --> 18:16.937
Hezbollah?

18:17.602 --> 18:19.002
He walks a dangerous path.

18:19.202 --> 18:21.202
What's the connection
with Corporal O'Neill?

18:21.237 --> 18:22.067
Could be software,

18:22.102 --> 18:25.702
hardware, troop
deployments, timetables...

18:26.502 --> 18:27.902
O'Neil could be a seller.

18:27.937 --> 18:28.967
Or a buyer.

18:29.002 --> 18:30.902
Either way, he keeps bad company.

18:31.102 --> 18:32.102
Think Franks knows?

18:36.402 --> 18:37.602
Know him, Mr. Shaloub?

18:37.902 --> 18:40.102
Marine Corporal Liam O'Neill.

18:40.702 --> 18:43.402
He came to see me. When?

18:44.002 --> 18:45.102
Two days ago.

18:46.002 --> 18:47.002
About?

18:47.702 --> 18:48.667
What all of my clients

18:48.702 --> 18:51.402
come to see me about,
Agent Gibbs: Money.

18:52.402 --> 18:53.602
Did you give him any?

18:53.902 --> 18:54.867
No, I decided

18:54.902 --> 18:56.902
he was too risky a proposition.

18:57.102 --> 18:58.902
What interest rate do you charge?

18:59.702 --> 19:01.502
Why? Do you need a loan?

19:03.902 --> 19:05.102
Fifty percent?

19:05.602 --> 19:06.752
One hundred percent?

19:06.787 --> 19:07.902
Two hundred percent?

19:08.302 --> 19:10.002
I would say the risk is theirs.

19:11.002 --> 19:13.302
How much did Corporal O'Neill want?

19:13.902 --> 19:16.102
$25,000.

19:18.202 --> 19:19.202
For?

19:19.402 --> 19:21.252
My policy is not to ask.

19:21.287 --> 19:23.102
Maybe you didn't have to...

19:24.102 --> 19:29.202
We met, we drank coffee,
we did not do business.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.702
He told me nothing about
why he needed the money.

19:33.502 --> 19:35.302
How soon did he need it?

19:35.402 --> 19:36.802
Immediately.

19:36.902 --> 19:38.267
- Cash?
- Of course.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.867
All my clients prefer cash.

19:39.902 --> 19:42.502
Even the ones in Beirut and Baghdad?

19:44.302 --> 19:46.702
I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

19:48.802 --> 19:50.802
From all that questions you are asking,

19:50.837 --> 19:52.767
I can only assume that Corporal O'Neill

19:52.802 --> 19:56.802
is involved in some criminal
activity, Agent Gibbs.

19:56.837 --> 19:58.502
You mean like you?

20:00.302 --> 20:02.202
If you believed that, Officer David,

20:02.702 --> 20:06.402
we would be meeting in
your office, not mine.

20:11.402 --> 20:12.667
There's someone you can call?

20:12.702 --> 20:14.813
- Might have a friend in Tela Aviv.
- Make it happen, Ziva.

20:14.837 --> 20:16.902
Shared intelligence. I'd settle for any.

20:16.937 --> 20:18.002
- Okay, thanks.
- McGee!

20:19.202 --> 20:20.702
Turn over a rock on this guy:

20:21.002 --> 20:23.302
Company records, IRS, bank details.

20:23.337 --> 20:25.602
I'll check the Homeland Security file.

20:25.637 --> 20:26.802
What am I looking for?

20:27.302 --> 20:28.802
You'll know it when you see it.

20:30.402 --> 20:31.402
How is he?

20:32.302 --> 20:33.802
They're done testing.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.102
Liam mixed up with him?

20:39.502 --> 20:40.502
McGee.

20:40.602 --> 20:41.602
Who is here?

20:42.102 --> 20:43.102
I can't say.

20:45.102 --> 20:48.702
Whatever he's done, good
or bad, he's still my boy.

20:49.902 --> 20:51.602
Nothing else I can tell you.

20:53.802 --> 20:55.702
It's not why I'm here.

21:01.202 --> 21:02.602
That's everything,

21:03.302 --> 21:05.252
apart from his clothing and his car.

21:05.287 --> 21:07.202
We're still checking these for prints.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.002
This belonged to his mother.

21:13.602 --> 21:16.502
Her religion... and mine.

21:17.202 --> 21:20.502
War and peace.

21:22.202 --> 21:24.002
Can you release these?

21:26.602 --> 21:28.802
I need one more thing, probie.

21:30.302 --> 21:31.702
A Witness.

21:53.102 --> 21:54.202
That's okay.

22:48.602 --> 22:50.002
Been waiting for you, Gibbs.

22:50.037 --> 22:51.102
You got something?

22:51.137 --> 22:52.502
I do.

22:52.802 --> 22:54.702
And you're not gonna like it.

22:55.402 --> 22:56.867
The print on the left

22:56.902 --> 22:59.502
was lifted from inside Liam's car.

23:00.302 --> 23:01.702
The print on the right

23:03.002 --> 23:05.602
is the match from our database.

23:12.802 --> 23:14.802
Franks was in the car, Gibbs.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.520
How much did Franks know?

23:26.555 --> 23:27.920
Not enough to save his son.

23:27.955 --> 23:28.785
Maybe not much at all.

23:28.820 --> 23:31.620
- You ever tell your dad what you were up to, probie?
- Every day.

23:31.655 --> 23:32.820
Wrong person to ask.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.770
Liam flew to Baghdad, met some bad guys,

23:34.805 --> 23:36.620
flew back, and someone
tried to kill him.

23:36.655 --> 23:37.585
Succeeded.

23:37.620 --> 23:38.870
Deal gone wrong, maybe?

23:38.905 --> 23:40.085
Dealing what?

23:40.120 --> 23:41.820
He was a communications specialist.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.985
Equipment, software, secrets.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.620
Only had limited access;
Didn't know any secrets.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.485
Yeah. Gibbs.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.320
Any news for me, probie?

23:51.620 --> 23:53.020
Could be, Mike.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.670
Come on in; I'll brief you.

23:54.705 --> 23:56.220
Why don't you come to me.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.085
Where?

23:57.120 --> 23:59.020
Fourth and H; By the southeast freeway.

23:59.055 --> 24:00.055
I'll be right there.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.220
Need any backup, boss?

24:02.320 --> 24:04.320
Friend, not foe, DiNozzo.

24:04.420 --> 24:05.420
We hope.

24:13.420 --> 24:15.720
Hey, you've reached
Jeanne. Leave a message.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.431
Hey, this is your friendly
neighborhood stalker

24:18.455 --> 24:20.420
leaving his third message of the day.

24:20.620 --> 24:21.885
Hope everything's okay.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.320
Call me when you can. Ciao.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.420
Did she give you the cold elbow?

24:29.020 --> 24:30.220
Shoulder.

24:30.820 --> 24:32.720
And no, she has very
warm shoulders to me.

24:32.755 --> 24:34.037
You two fighting?

24:34.072 --> 24:35.320
We don't fight.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.620
Well, maybe she does and
you haven't even noticed.

24:37.655 --> 24:39.620
Or maybe you said
something that hurt her,

24:39.820 --> 24:42.120
or maybe you said nothing

24:43.020 --> 24:44.620
when you should have said something.

24:44.655 --> 24:45.655
Mmm.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.620
She's just busy.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.320
High-stress job.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.620
Not a lot of time for phone calls.

24:51.655 --> 24:52.820
Do you mind?

24:53.520 --> 24:54.720
- Of course.
- Thanks.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.020
Hi, I'm trying to
contact Dr. Jeanne Benoit.

25:04.055 --> 25:04.785
I was wondering if...

25:04.820 --> 25:06.620
oh, I'm sorry, she's
already left for the day.

25:06.820 --> 25:07.685
She has?!

25:07.720 --> 25:08.770
Yes, - What time?

25:08.805 --> 25:09.785
About an hour ago?

25:09.820 --> 25:11.631
- Would you like to leave a message?
- No, no message.

25:11.655 --> 25:13.620
- Okay, then.
- I'll call her at home, thanks.

25:13.655 --> 25:14.655
You're welcome.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.920
Found your prints in his car, Mike.

25:35.020 --> 25:36.385
Figured you probably would.

25:36.420 --> 25:38.085
You should have told me you saw him.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.220
Didn't want you asking
me too many questions.

25:40.255 --> 25:41.255
About?

25:42.420 --> 25:44.420
What my son was involved in.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.020
Are you gonna tell me?

25:51.020 --> 25:53.320
I saw him a couple of days ago.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.220
He needed money.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.920
Just about cleaned me out.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.620
But I got it for him.

25:59.655 --> 26:01.320
$25,000.

26:01.620 --> 26:04.520
He took $500, asked me to hold the rest.

26:04.555 --> 26:06.420
Said it was safer that way.

26:06.820 --> 26:09.220
Said he would call me when he needed it.

26:09.420 --> 26:10.585
Never called.

26:10.620 --> 26:12.020
What's this about?

26:13.220 --> 26:14.120
Wouldn't tell me.

26:14.155 --> 26:15.387
He wouldn't tell you,

26:15.422 --> 26:16.620
or you won't tell me?!

26:19.620 --> 26:22.620
We're getting more
alike, you and me, probie.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.020
Even feeling the same pain.

26:25.420 --> 26:27.120
I don't know how you didn't go crazy

26:27.155 --> 26:28.920
when you lost your little girl.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.920
Maybe you did for a while.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.720
Maybe you still are..

26:32.820 --> 26:36.220
I just know I got to do
what's right for my boy.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.320
I owe him that.

26:40.620 --> 26:42.120
Let me handle it.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.520
You got to be somewhere?

26:47.220 --> 26:50.120
I want the body sent
to my place in Mexico

26:50.155 --> 26:52.120
when Ducky's done with it.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.085
Can you arrange that for me?

26:54.120 --> 26:56.720
I don't want to have
to come after you, Mike.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.520
Then don't.

27:15.420 --> 27:16.420
Hey.

27:16.520 --> 27:17.820
Hey back.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.285
I left some messages.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.920
I was getting kind of worried.

27:21.620 --> 27:22.820
I'm fine.

27:23.220 --> 27:27.020
I'm not getting that "I'm
fine" feeling from you, Jeanne.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.220
I was gonna bring you flowers.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.320
Where are they?

27:36.020 --> 27:38.420
Uh, I didn't want to stop.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.120
Big mistake.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.920
Jeanne, this is about, uh...

27:47.320 --> 27:49.920
about what I didn't say when
I beat you to the top, right?

27:51.120 --> 27:53.420
I wanted to believe that, uh...

27:53.920 --> 27:56.120
you didn't understand what I was saying.

27:57.020 --> 27:59.620
I wanted to give you a second chance.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.820
And a third chance, and a fourth chance.

28:02.855 --> 28:05.520
I've said it now, Tony,
and you never have.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.020
Well, that's not true.

28:10.420 --> 28:12.920
"Love you," after
other physical pursuits

28:12.955 --> 28:16.120
is not the same as "I love you."

28:16.320 --> 28:17.485
And please,

28:17.520 --> 28:20.520
don't insult either
of us by saying it now.

28:24.020 --> 28:25.820
Even if I mean it?

28:25.920 --> 28:27.620
I don't think you know if you mean it.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.720
I love you.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.920
Now you need to figure out
if you feel the same way.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.820
I don't want to hurt you.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.370
Then just go now and figure out

28:44.405 --> 28:46.420
what it is that you want for us.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.585
Ziva... Talk to your friend yet?

28:55.620 --> 28:58.120
Shaloub is a person of
interest, but that is all.

28:58.220 --> 28:59.485
No known terrorist links.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.620
More concerned with money than ideology.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.820
That's Mike Franks' rental.
Put out a BOLO on it.

29:03.855 --> 29:04.685
If he has been here,

29:04.720 --> 29:07.220
he's probably booked
into a hotel or motel.

29:07.420 --> 29:08.720
Start checking.

29:08.820 --> 29:09.620
McGee.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.685
I'm still trying to crack.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.220
Liam's voice mail security code, so...

29:13.520 --> 29:15.620
matter of time. Something we don't have.

29:15.655 --> 29:16.820
DiNozzo.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.420
Boss.

29:20.620 --> 29:22.020
You help Ziva.

29:25.220 --> 29:26.220
Hey.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.520
Not good?

29:27.555 --> 29:28.720
Not good.

29:34.920 --> 29:35.485
Gibbs!

29:35.520 --> 29:36.785
U shouldn't be here!

29:36.820 --> 29:38.085
I don't have anything for you,

29:38.120 --> 29:40.320
and I didn't send out
any "calling Gibbs" vibes.

29:40.355 --> 29:41.885
I'm not psychic, Abs. Just checking.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.020
Did Mike try to get any
information about the case?

29:44.120 --> 29:45.320
I barely saw him.

29:46.220 --> 29:47.220
Hasn't phoned?

29:47.255 --> 29:48.255
No.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.531
You thought he might try to
sneak a peek at the evidence?

29:50.555 --> 29:51.420
I would've.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.885
Well, then why didn't he?

29:52.920 --> 29:54.720
Seeing as you two are so much alike.

29:54.820 --> 29:56.185
Peas in a pod, Gibbs.

29:56.220 --> 29:57.720
Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum.

29:58.620 --> 29:59.620
Whoa.

29:59.920 --> 30:00.785
Gibbs...

30:00.820 --> 30:02.820
you knew before I knew it knew.

30:02.855 --> 30:04.420
Before it knew it knew!

30:04.620 --> 30:07.720
Green compound we found in
Corporal O'Neill's pants pocket.

30:07.755 --> 30:09.320
That's what I was gonna call you about.

30:09.355 --> 30:11.220
This is getting really spooky.

30:14.820 --> 30:16.185
Lawsonia inermis.

30:16.220 --> 30:17.685
More commonly known as Henna.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.920
It's used in bodyart,
mostly in the middle-east.

30:19.955 --> 30:21.687
It's beautiful, but it doesn't last,

30:21.722 --> 30:23.385
- not like a real tattoo.
- Other uses?

30:23.420 --> 30:25.485
Hair dye. But the
tattoos are really cool.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.220
They have a lot of intricate
patterns and shadings.

30:28.255 --> 30:29.320
I should probably get one.

30:29.355 --> 30:30.355
What do you think?

30:30.520 --> 30:31.720
Don't answer out loud.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.720
Just think it.

30:41.320 --> 30:42.920
I'll take that as a no.

30:44.020 --> 30:46.585
Well, here we are again, dear boy.

30:46.620 --> 30:49.820
Not the outcome for which
either of us had hoped.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.820
No more miracles, just answers.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.920
You're 2 hours early, Jethro.

30:56.955 --> 30:58.320
I'm only just beginning.

30:58.420 --> 30:59.585
Any tattoos, Ducky?

30:59.620 --> 31:03.520
Ah, a direct query,
demanding a direct response,

31:03.555 --> 31:05.420
which, in this case, is a direct No.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.720
Somewhat surprising for a young Marine.

31:12.220 --> 31:13.320
Autopsy.

31:13.420 --> 31:15.031
Is Gibbs with you, by
any chance? Yes, he is.

31:15.055 --> 31:17.720
- Tell him I cracked the code, okay?
- Indeed.

31:19.620 --> 31:21.920
Timothy says to tell you
that he's cracked the code,

31:21.955 --> 31:23.420
whatever that may mean.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.520
No peace, even for the dead.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.520
Just wanted to make sure...

31:34.920 --> 31:36.820
There's only one
message in Liam's in box.

31:38.020 --> 31:40.720
Hey, buddy, your package
arrives at the end of the week.

31:40.755 --> 31:43.420
You want to pick it up,
the price just doubled.

31:43.720 --> 31:44.820
Nick Taylor.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.520
The last call Liam
made was to Fast-Flight.

31:47.555 --> 31:48.920
Maybe it was to arrange a meeting.

31:49.220 --> 31:51.120
They meet, they argue, they fight.

31:52.020 --> 31:53.685
Logged into FAA, Gibbs.

31:53.720 --> 31:57.720
Fast Flight FF-716 freight
service from Baghdad.

31:58.520 --> 31:59.820
We have a problem.

32:00.220 --> 32:02.020
It landed an hour and a half ago.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.320
Clear!

32:18.220 --> 32:19.220
Clear!

32:27.820 --> 32:29.520
Somebody beat us to it.

32:42.159 --> 32:43.459
Multiple victims.

32:43.959 --> 32:45.459
Multiple wounds.

32:46.259 --> 32:47.959
Pray and spray. DUCKY: Possibly.

32:48.759 --> 32:52.759
But dead only a matter of 15 or
20 minutes before you arrived.

32:53.159 --> 32:54.409
Jethro, do you think...?

32:54.444 --> 32:55.659
I'm not speculating, Duck.

32:55.694 --> 32:56.476
I want evidence.

32:56.511 --> 32:57.511
Gibbs...

32:57.959 --> 33:00.359
blankets, pillows, water bottles.

33:01.559 --> 33:02.959
All the comforts of home.

33:02.994 --> 33:04.259
Human cargo.

33:05.259 --> 33:06.759
Looks to be three of everything.

33:06.794 --> 33:07.924
But only two bodies,

33:07.959 --> 33:10.459
assuming Taylor was
already here at the office.

33:10.494 --> 33:11.759
One got away.

33:12.059 --> 33:13.759
- The shooter?
- Maybe.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.159
Boss.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.759
Arabic.

33:25.659 --> 33:26.859
It's a Koran.

33:27.759 --> 33:29.759
The FAA says all the
paperwork was in order

33:29.794 --> 33:30.724
when the flight landed.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.759
Customs? Only checked
the cargo manifest. No X - ray,

33:33.794 --> 33:35.324
no physical search of air containers.

33:35.359 --> 33:37.370
It was unloaded and taken
straight to the warehouse.

33:37.394 --> 33:38.024
Air crew?

33:38.059 --> 33:39.709
Oblivious. Still at the airport

33:39.744 --> 33:41.324
overseeing an engine inspection.

33:41.359 --> 33:43.359
Got an I.D. on the
other two victims here.

33:43.659 --> 33:45.259
Peter Thomas McLean,

33:45.559 --> 33:46.959
Private, United States Army.

33:46.994 --> 33:48.359
Reported missing three weeks ago

33:48.394 --> 33:49.824
from the U.S. Army base

33:49.859 --> 33:51.359
at Wuerzburg, near Frankfurt.

33:51.394 --> 33:53.059
Missing? Deserted.

33:53.159 --> 33:55.459
Unit was shipped to Iraq two
days after he disappeared.

33:55.759 --> 33:58.659
Second victim is Franz Bernhard Schuler.

33:58.859 --> 34:02.559
He's a German national wanted by
Interpol for murder... killed a cop.

34:02.594 --> 34:05.459
Believed to be trying to flee
Europe for the United States.

34:06.159 --> 34:07.159
Made it.

34:07.659 --> 34:11.159
Almost. Taylor was running a
passenger service for bad guys.

34:11.359 --> 34:12.724
Wonder how much the tickets were?

34:12.759 --> 34:15.859
Too much. Which leads
us to passenger number

34:15.893 --> 34:17.724
three.. Muslim and missing.

34:17.759 --> 34:20.159
- Terrorist?
- Might explain all the dead bodies.

34:20.194 --> 34:22.059
Left to no one alive to identify him.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.659
Or maybe just a frightened witness

34:23.694 --> 34:24.976
who got away. GIBBS: Anything?

34:25.011 --> 34:26.224
Phone company can't track him.

34:26.259 --> 34:28.059
Franks must have his cell phone off.

34:28.159 --> 34:30.059
He knows we'd be trying
to get a hold of him.

34:33.559 --> 34:34.123
McGee.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.059
This is Metro. We have
a hit on your BOLO.

34:36.094 --> 34:37.559
Where? 2615 Linden.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.159
Got it. Thank you.

34:41.859 --> 34:43.759
Metro police just found Franks' car.

34:47.759 --> 34:49.559
We could fall back and
set up surveillance.

34:49.759 --> 34:50.958
It's too late.

34:51.359 --> 34:52.559
Must be a dozen hotels

34:52.594 --> 34:53.759
within a mile of here, boss.

34:53.859 --> 34:54.859
Parked and walked?

34:55.159 --> 34:56.458
That's what I'd do.

34:57.359 --> 34:59.239
I'll start checking them
as soon as we get back.

35:12.659 --> 35:13.659
Oh, boy.

35:21.259 --> 35:22.959
Recently fired.

35:25.659 --> 35:26.759
Think he did it?

35:26.859 --> 35:28.959
Mike Franks is a very capable man.

35:29.259 --> 35:31.359
That extend to murder? Revenge.

35:31.394 --> 35:32.559
Taylor killed his son.

35:33.359 --> 35:34.559
Still murder.

35:34.594 --> 35:35.594
DiNozzo.

35:35.659 --> 35:37.724
Uh, 17 hotels

35:37.759 --> 35:39.259
and motels within 15 minutes

35:39.294 --> 35:40.759
walk of where we found the car.

35:40.794 --> 35:42.224
I'm e-mailing

35:42.259 --> 35:43.659
the photo of Franks now.

35:43.694 --> 35:44.694
Glock?

35:44.759 --> 35:47.359
Registered to Nick Taylor.
He was a licensed shooter.

35:48.259 --> 35:50.359
McGee, you found anything
under that rock yet?

35:50.394 --> 35:52.159
- Still working, boss.
- IRS?

35:52.194 --> 35:53.559
Clean bill of health.

35:53.859 --> 35:56.559
Shaloub pays his taxes,
files his returns.

35:56.959 --> 36:00.159
Pagoda's got a modest turnover.
The more you look, the less you see.

36:00.194 --> 36:01.959
Gotta hide his money somewhere, probie.

36:01.994 --> 36:03.959
No association with any charities?

36:04.059 --> 36:05.770
I know where you're headed,
but he's not making any big

36:05.794 --> 36:08.659
donations to suspect charities. Travel?

36:09.359 --> 36:12.959
In and out of the country seven
times over the last four months...

36:12.994 --> 36:13.824
which is odd,

36:13.859 --> 36:15.570
'cause this guy's meticulous
with his tax returns.

36:15.594 --> 36:17.424
He lists all his deductions.

36:17.459 --> 36:19.770
All that travel and he didn't
claim it as a business expense.

36:19.794 --> 36:21.659
Well, someone must have
been paying for him.

36:21.694 --> 36:23.259
Or he wasn't paying at all.

36:23.359 --> 36:25.624
Check when and where he
flew, against FAA records.

36:25.659 --> 36:28.159
All that's going to tell us
is what airline he flew with.

36:28.659 --> 36:29.659
Typing.

36:31.559 --> 36:34.059
It's the same airline
every time: Fast Flight.

36:34.159 --> 36:35.359
Go get him.

36:37.159 --> 36:41.159
Sometimes I fly Fast Flight instead
of a scheduled commercial flight.

36:41.559 --> 36:43.459
I wasn't breaking the law, Agent Gibbs,

36:43.494 --> 36:45.459
or any FAA regulations.

36:45.859 --> 36:48.259
Fast Flight is only
registered to carry freight,

36:48.459 --> 36:50.259
not passengers.

36:50.759 --> 36:52.359
I wasn't a paying passenger.

36:52.459 --> 36:54.059
Taylor was doing you a favor?

36:56.559 --> 36:59.459
Let me tell you what you
clearly don't know, Agent Gibbs.

37:00.259 --> 37:02.059
I helped finance Fast Flight.

37:02.459 --> 37:05.159
What you might call a silent partner.

37:05.959 --> 37:08.559
Not one of my wiser
investment decisions.

37:09.959 --> 37:10.824
When?

37:10.859 --> 37:11.909
12 months ago.

37:11.944 --> 37:12.959
How much?

37:13.659 --> 37:17.359
The initial outlay was half a
million dollars - I pumped in as much

37:17.394 --> 37:19.459
again in the last six months.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.224
Free flights to Europe

37:21.259 --> 37:23.659
were the only return I
was seeing on my money.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.159
The company's failing.

37:26.559 --> 37:28.159
Taylor is incompetent.

37:28.559 --> 37:30.359
Was.

37:32.259 --> 37:33.324
Something's happened?

37:33.359 --> 37:35.559
You should know. You were there.

37:35.959 --> 37:36.959
Where?

37:37.259 --> 37:38.559
The warehouse.

37:39.459 --> 37:41.559
Three men shot dead...

37:41.759 --> 37:43.359
including Taylor.

37:43.759 --> 37:45.459
I had nothing to do with this.

37:45.494 --> 37:46.859
Why'd you do it?

37:46.959 --> 37:48.659
I just told you I didn't.

37:49.159 --> 37:51.970
Because Taylor was smuggling people
into the country and didn't tell you?

37:51.994 --> 37:54.859
No... Or you just found out
and wanted to cut of the action?

37:54.894 --> 37:58.459
No! I had nothing to do
with this, Agent Gibbs.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.459
You got the wrong man.

38:10.659 --> 38:11.859
What's this white stuff?

38:12.659 --> 38:13.859
Calcium oxide.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.459
Lime?!

38:17.659 --> 38:19.259
Did you use it to dust for prints?

38:19.459 --> 38:20.259
No.

38:20.359 --> 38:21.559
It was already there.

38:21.594 --> 38:22.726
There were no prints.

38:22.761 --> 38:23.824
It must have been wiped.

38:23.859 --> 38:25.459
So how'd the lime get on here?

38:26.559 --> 38:28.459
Same way the crystalline silica did.

38:28.659 --> 38:31.559
And it wasn't just on the grip,
it was in the slide action.

38:31.859 --> 38:33.859
I had to clean it off
before I could fire it.

38:37.459 --> 38:39.859
Ooh. Bad?

38:39.894 --> 38:40.459
Bad.

38:40.659 --> 38:41.659
How bad?

38:44.159 --> 38:46.259
The striations on the bullets match.

38:46.459 --> 38:48.459
The Glock found in Mike Franks' car,

38:48.659 --> 38:50.059
it's the murder weapon.

38:53.459 --> 38:54.459
Thanks.

38:55.059 --> 38:56.159
Found Franks, boss.

38:56.359 --> 38:57.709
Booked into a hotel 15 minutes.

38:57.744 --> 38:59.070
Walked from where we found the car.

38:59.094 --> 39:00.224
False name, paid cash,

39:00.259 --> 39:02.759
manager I.D.'d him from
the photo I e-mailed.

39:02.794 --> 39:05.259
Hotel's at 1127 Church Avenue.

39:05.359 --> 39:06.759
Franks is still there.

39:06.959 --> 39:08.259
Will we bring him in?

39:08.959 --> 39:10.159
It's glass, boss.

39:10.559 --> 39:12.659
Crystalline silica and calcium oxide.

39:12.694 --> 39:13.924
Used in glassmaking.

39:13.959 --> 39:16.259
It was all over the Glock,
even in the slide action.

39:16.359 --> 39:18.659
Abby had to clean it
before she could fire it.

39:18.694 --> 39:20.959
Anyway, there is a glass
manufacturer right next

39:20.994 --> 39:22.559
to the Fast Flight warehouse.

39:32.559 --> 39:33.324
Agent Gibbs...

39:33.359 --> 39:34.659
Take off your shoes.

39:36.359 --> 39:37.324
What?!

39:37.359 --> 39:39.059
Need to look at your shoes.

39:48.459 --> 39:49.459
Wallet.

39:59.759 --> 40:01.559
Sequential serial numbers.

40:02.259 --> 40:03.659
Where's the rest?

40:03.759 --> 40:05.859
You think you can
intimidate me, Agent Gibbs?

40:05.894 --> 40:06.894
McGee?

40:07.359 --> 40:09.259
Looks like traces of calcium oxide

40:09.294 --> 40:11.159
and crystalline silica in the treads.

40:11.359 --> 40:12.959
It's used in glass manufacture.

40:13.559 --> 40:16.359
Hollander Glass Company's
right next door to Fast Flight.

40:16.659 --> 40:18.324
You ever notice all that white stuff

40:18.359 --> 40:20.959
on the ground behind the
back of their building?

40:20.994 --> 40:23.559
That is crystalline
silica and calcium oxide.

40:24.759 --> 40:26.059
You got it on your shoes

40:27.559 --> 40:29.459
when you dumped this into the Dumpster

40:29.494 --> 40:30.759
behind their building.

40:31.159 --> 40:32.759
You should have left it at the scene.

40:33.759 --> 40:34.959
It wasn't me.

40:35.259 --> 40:36.659
I got a witness!

40:38.459 --> 40:39.809
Hope we got a witness.

40:39.844 --> 40:41.159
If we can find 'em.

40:42.359 --> 40:44.659
I had nothing to do with
the murder of that Marine.

40:45.359 --> 40:46.824
Taylor was out of control

40:46.859 --> 40:50.859
trying to cash flow his
business by people-smuggling.

40:51.159 --> 40:54.059
He wouldn't let them leave
because he wanted more money.

40:54.359 --> 40:56.059
And then he pulled that gun on me.

40:56.759 --> 40:57.624
I took it off him.

40:57.659 --> 40:59.059
I was defending myself.

40:59.959 --> 41:01.359
What about the other two?

41:19.159 --> 41:20.159
Hey.

41:22.159 --> 41:23.024
We got him.

41:23.059 --> 41:25.259
Knew you'd figure it
out eventually, probie.

41:25.759 --> 41:27.859
Unfinished business,
that why you went there?

41:28.559 --> 41:29.759
I owed him that.

41:31.659 --> 41:34.059
Paid the rest of the cash,
picked up the package.

41:34.094 --> 41:35.424
Came back to the hotel.

41:35.459 --> 41:38.659
But you went back
again, didn't you, Mike?

41:39.559 --> 41:41.259
Shaloub was already there.

41:41.294 --> 41:42.759
I heard the shots.

41:42.959 --> 41:45.359
I saw him come out of
the building in a panic.

41:45.859 --> 41:46.924
I saw him wipe the weapon

41:46.959 --> 41:48.724
and toss it over into the Dumpster.

41:48.759 --> 41:51.159
You were going to plant it
in his car and give me a call?

41:51.959 --> 41:53.359
That was the idea,

41:53.759 --> 41:57.559
but you found my rental
and I didn't get a chance.

41:57.594 --> 41:58.626
Well, you were a witness.

41:58.661 --> 41:59.624
You didn't need to do that

41:59.659 --> 42:02.359
unless you had something to hide, Mike.

42:06.559 --> 42:08.459
She's from Mexico.

42:27.859 --> 42:29.959
We left in a bit of a hurry.

42:31.659 --> 42:33.524
They were going to be married.

42:33.559 --> 42:37.259
Her family in Baghdad
said that she shamed them.

42:37.459 --> 42:39.959
She's been in hiding for six months.

42:40.259 --> 42:42.659
He was desperate to get her out.

42:43.759 --> 42:45.424
I don't think any of this

42:45.459 --> 42:47.859
is relevant to your case, probie.

42:52.659 --> 42:54.659
I guess not, Mike.
