Since taking an adult responsibility
adding yourself to the church,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.971
you'll belong to him now,
and just like he tells us in Joshua 1:5,

00:13.055 --> 00:15.015
"He'll never leave me,
He'll never forsake me."

00:15.473 --> 00:17.142
And just like in the Bible,

00:17.225 --> 00:19.728
I want to hear you confess
Christ is the son of God.

00:20.395 --> 00:24.692
I believe that Jesus Christ is God's son,
and that he died for my sins.

[Dakota] <i>In my household where I grew up,</i>

00:26.443 --> 00:29.487
we weren't really a religious family,
you know.

00:30.072 --> 00:32.658
And I really wanted to get religious...

00:33.242 --> 00:34.243
because...

00:35.452 --> 00:38.371
because I know God has a plan for me,
you know what I mean.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.916
And that's why I feel like I'm here
in Scooba, Mississippi.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.585
Dakota, my brother,

00:42.668 --> 00:45.420
I baptize you in the name
of the Father, the Son...

05:00.717 --> 05:03.095
I'm glad he a changed man.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.810
Boy, Coach Stephens would have
cussed our ass out bad.

05:09.893 --> 05:13.981
Bro, he should've still had some of that
last year in him this year.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.067
'Cause, I mean, this year,
even though he softened up,

05:17.150 --> 05:19.277
- they slack off.
- Yeah.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.405
Last year, bro, it was a rout.

- Yeah.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.247
I see where he was coming from,

05:30.330 --> 05:33.666
because, I mean, in this league,
you can't miss that many games,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.502
or they will take your offers away.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.088

but still get hurt

05:38.171 --> 05:39.506

'cause they got somebody else
in your position that ain't hurt.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.928
He had a concussion, so he can...

05:45.012 --> 05:47.931
Really can't stress that,
or he end up like Coach Trickett.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.850
Ain't no reason
to risk no injury like that,

05:50.934 --> 05:53.811
'cause I mean, you need your head
even for football or not.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.524
I don't wanna have a job one day
and be crazy,

05:57.607 --> 06:00.777
and just go off with a job
and then you end up getting fired.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.906
And you ain't got nothing,
'cause football gone.

06:04.907 --> 06:08.451
Football is a temporary thing.
It ain't forever.

so it's your fault

'bout your head hurt.

my shit got pulled.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.432

- Scholarships!

- Yes, he got a concussion.
- Yeah.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.479
[Wagner] Then why are we playing him?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.483
Like, to me, you go to the doctor,
and you have a concussion or you don't.

- The thing is...
- I don't care what...

06:41.151 --> 06:43.320
They tell the player one thing,
tell the coach another.

Yo.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.073
[Bontrager] How was practice?

after I practice.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.877
I don't got no headache.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.922
- And then...
- Anything else? Dizziness?

07:03.006 --> 07:04.757
Pressure in head?

07:04.841 --> 07:07.594
- Difficulty concentrating?
- Mmm-mmm.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.183
<i>his well-being is on the line,
you know,</i>

<i>when he leaves here
with what he does on the field,</i>

07:15.644 --> 07:18.355
<i>but he just kind of lost it.</i>

07:18.855 --> 07:20.523
I mean, he was <i>so </i>negative.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.168
And there were coaches there on that...

07:22.192 --> 07:24.152
Mississippi State was there,
and I mean if...

07:24.236 --> 07:27.114
if you were on our sideline,
you saw him and you heard him.

07:27.197 --> 07:31.368
So there was no denying
that he was throwing a temper tantrum.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.162
<i>And if too many coaches see that...</i>

07:34.829 --> 07:37.183
<i>he's gonna shoot himself in the foot,
because coaches don't...</i>

07:37.207 --> 07:40.710

that negativity, you know.

[Wagner] <i>A brain injury</i>
<i>is bigger than a game.</i>

<i>I mean, that... that's a long-term,
serious thing to mess around with.</i>

07:52.805 --> 07:58.770
<i>And I don't think an 18, 19-year-old

[Jazlyn] <i>He was mad.</i>
<i>He wasn't looking at it</i>

08:32.637 --> 08:35.682

or he was like...

08:35.765 --> 08:37.892
"They shouldn't have pulled me
from the game."

08:37.975 --> 08:40.687
And I was there, I was like,
"Well, just calm down,"

08:40.770 --> 08:42.064
and he was like, "No!"

08:42.647 --> 08:45.775
And, like, it just...
It took a lot to calm him down.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.819
Like, it takes a lot to calm him down.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.739
He calmed down.
It took a day or two or three.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.419
I've been doing that since I can walk.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.848
And when they told me I couldn't play
because of a little concussion,

09:07.922 --> 09:09.382
I was feeling like, "I'm straight."

09:09.466 --> 09:12.302
I ain't worried about no concussion.
I want to play football.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.595
[stuttering] I'd rather...

09:13.678 --> 09:16.347
I'd rather get hurt on the field
instead of not playing.

[Jazlyn] <i>He can be hard to deal with.</i>

09:25.648 --> 09:27.775

<i>to where you have to push him
more than usual.</i>

09:31.488 --> 09:34.574
<i>But he has a reason to be hard,
he has a reason to be uptight.</i>

09:34.657 --> 09:36.201
<i>It's because of what he went through.</i>

09:36.284 --> 09:40.580

everybody into his... his world.

Like, she the only person I express
my full emotions to.

She's just one of them ones I can talk to.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.266
[Jazlyn] <i>He used to tell me,</i>

"Have you ever, like, wondered, like,
where... where your mom was?"

10:02.059 --> 10:03.811
He was like, "Yeah. I was a kid."

10:03.895 --> 10:05.397
He was like, "I was six years old."

10:05.480 --> 10:07.940

"Of course I wondered," like...

<i>He's like, "I look at the door, like,
is she gonna come back today?"</i>

where I had to, like,</i>

10:17.492 --> 10:20.036

four or five hours.</i>

10:20.912 --> 10:23.498
<i>Four or five hours,
just listening to him talk.</i>

10:24.081 --> 10:26.668
<i>He'll be like,
"There is something wrong with me.</i>

10:26.751 --> 10:28.461
I was a problem." Like...

10:29.171 --> 10:31.131
You were never the problem,
you were a baby.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.924
How could you be a problem?

10:33.007 --> 10:36.093
Or he felt like nobody cared about him.
Or he felt like nobody wanted him.

10:37.178 --> 10:41.141
<i>Like, that's all he wants, like...
somebody to care about him.</i>

10:41.766 --> 10:44.436
<i>Just to care.
Just to say, "I care about you."</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:50.733
[indistinct chatter]

10:52.985 --> 10:54.297
[Wagner] <i>Were you there the whole weekend?</i>

10:54.321 --> 10:57.990
- Mm-hmm. It was fun.
- [Wagner] I'm sure it was.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.326
Yeah, it was fun.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.579
Think I'm in love with Ole Miss.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.956
In love? With Ole Miss?

11:05.707 --> 11:08.042
- And their women.
- Oh, dear.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.462
But let's make a smart decision.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.798
- Is that the best place for you?
- True that.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.008
Yes, ma'am.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.176
Is a party place
with a lot of beautiful women

11:17.260 --> 11:19.721
really gonna be the best place for you?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.224
So what's the best place for me?

11:22.307 --> 11:24.267
I'm asking. I don't know the answer.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.729
- [stutters] No women, military, uh...
- I don't know the answer to the question.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.732
- I'm just asking you to think about it.
- Oh, okay.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.692
I got you.
Something for me to think about.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.976
[Wagner] Mm-hmm.
You'll get in trouble with your woman.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.280
[Dakota] Mmm-mmm.
Get in trouble with the law.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.906
I... I have a curfew.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.409
- [Wagner] What's your curfew?
- I think 11:00.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.203
- You think?
- Yeah.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.622
How come you don't know?

11:46.038 --> 11:48.750
It's something like that.
It's an outrageous...

11:48.833 --> 11:50.460
outrageous, uh, time.

11:51.878 --> 11:56.508
Like, they can take me right back to jail
if I'm out. [chuckles]

11:57.425 --> 12:00.011
- Well, I don't really need that to happen.
- Mmm-mmm.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.638
We both don't need that to happen.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.516
- Did you have to spend the night?
- Damn near.

12:05.933 --> 12:10.272
I was there all the way
till about 3:30 the next morning.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.149
- It sucked.
- Were you scared?

12:14.233 --> 12:15.902
I wasn't scared. I was just...

12:16.819 --> 12:18.863
mad and bored.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.577
- Mad at what? At yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.621
Mad at myself.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.706
I got involved in some...

12:29.332 --> 12:31.543
In some legal trouble, you know, some...

12:32.294 --> 12:36.130
I got involved with people
I shouldn't have been involved with.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.507
And then...

12:40.427 --> 12:43.763
[sighs] I'm sorry, it's like,
it's something hard to talk about.

12:43.846 --> 12:44.846
Uh...

12:47.559 --> 12:50.437
They ended up charging me
with a second degree felony

12:50.520 --> 12:52.730
of a burglary of habitation.

12:54.190 --> 12:58.027
<i>So, of course, Coach Kingsbury kicked me
and two other players off the team,</i>

12:58.110 --> 12:59.696
<i>'cause they were charged
with the same.</i>

13:00.738 --> 13:04.909
I went home,
back to Humble in Houston after that.

13:05.117 --> 13:09.163
And for a long time, I thought
I was never gonna play football again.

13:10.039 --> 13:14.085
And it was truly the worst feeling
I ever had in my life.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.589
I talked to, uh, Tech yesterday.

13:17.672 --> 13:21.718
I have to, basically,
write an, uh, appeal...

13:21.801 --> 13:23.720
Like, why they should let me
back on the campus.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.138
'Cause now, I can't...
I'm not even allowed back on campus

13:26.222 --> 13:28.391
until January 2018.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.603
<i>At Texas Tech, I used to wake up
and dread practice, and...</i>

13:32.687 --> 13:36.065
<i>and just dread going to school,
but now when I wake up,</i>

13:36.149 --> 13:39.027
<i>I just thank God that...
that God woke me up.</i>

13:39.527 --> 13:41.904
I'm just thankful to be alive every day.
I'm just...

13:41.988 --> 13:44.657
I'm just thankful to follow his plan.

13:44.741 --> 13:48.202
And I'm... and I'm anxious to see
what he has in store for me.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.923
[Ed Holly] There's two things
we emphasize this week! Two!

14:01.007 --> 14:03.510
Not 40, not 50! Two!

14:03.593 --> 14:05.512
Run to the ball and tackle.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.973
So, number one, keys to success,
run to the football.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.267
Run to the football. Hunt together.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.562
Lions hunt in a pack. Hunt together.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.231
Number two, tackling.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.984
Guys, we have to show
the entire state of Mississippi

14:20.067 --> 14:21.444
that we are, without a doubt,

14:21.528 --> 14:26.282
the most physical, dominating presence
on defense, and we haven't done that yet.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.702
We go out on that field,
we just have to execute it.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.539
Over the top, over the top. No!

14:32.622 --> 14:34.666
<i>You know, we're a result-driven business,</i>

14:34.749 --> 14:37.168
<i>and then if you don't produce
on the field,</i>

14:37.251 --> 14:39.462
<i>you're not gonna be able to sit
in this seat.</i>

14:39.546 --> 14:40.963
<i>We struggled a bit at Itawamba,</i>

14:41.047 --> 14:42.674
and we didn't make the plays we had to,

14:42.757 --> 14:44.877
and thank God, we got the best offense
in the country,

14:44.926 --> 14:46.428
'cause they saved our tail.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.631
- Do it again, do it again!
- [player] Reload, reload!

14:48.679 --> 14:51.766
[Ed Holly] <i>But for us, East Mississippi</i>
<i>doesn't give up 30-plus points.</i>

14:51.849 --> 14:54.352
And to be honest with you, it was,
it was my fault.

14:54.436 --> 14:55.937
We can't give up those points.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.524
And if we do, there's a problem.
And I gotta fix that problem.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.193
- [player 1] Reset!
- [Ed Holly] Move, move! Get over the top!

15:02.276 --> 15:06.155
- [players grunting and chattering]
- [Ed Holly] If I feel downhill on a pull,

15:06.238 --> 15:08.825
when that guard pulls,
I gotta be drawing with him.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.660
<i>So you have to take all responsibilities.</i>

15:10.743 --> 15:16.249
Yes, your entire existence revolves
on 17, 18, and 19-year-old kids.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.127
[Buddy] Get down!
Rodney, line up here and go there.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.212
[Rodney] Reset!

15:22.171 --> 15:23.673
Set it, set it, set it. Well...

15:23.756 --> 15:26.426
I got him, Coach! Coach, I got him!

15:26.509 --> 15:28.135
- [player] Coach Williams!
- I got him!

15:28.219 --> 15:29.887
[Isaiah] <i>Coach think our defense suspect.</i>

15:29.971 --> 15:32.348
I don't like this shit, man. For real.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.935
We need to blame everybody
but the offense. We gotta come out strong.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.770
[player] Hey, real talk, bro. For real.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.356
[Isaiah] They're being real,
they think our defense suspect.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.001
[Isaiah] D-block on me, D-block on three.
One, two, three.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.706
- [players] D-block.
- [indistinct chatter]

15:44.736 --> 15:46.697
[Ed Holly] <i>Let's be honest,</i>
<i>if I was a bank teller</i>

15:46.779 --> 15:49.156
<i>and I have a bad day,
I would know and my boss would know.</i>

15:49.240 --> 15:51.868
But when I have a bad day
or the defense has a bad day,

15:51.951 --> 15:54.621
5,000 people know,
everybody in the community knows,

15:54.704 --> 15:56.831
<i>and not only do I feel it,
but the family feels it.</i>

15:56.914 --> 15:58.541
<i>The kids go to school, they, you know,</i>

15:58.624 --> 16:01.043
<i>hear things, they go on the playground,
they hear things.</i>

16:01.127 --> 16:02.837
<i>Everybody knows what Dad does</i>

16:02.920 --> 16:05.631
<i>and it can be pretty rough on 'em
sometimes now.</i>

16:05.715 --> 16:07.842
I mean, that's...
I say, guys, we're tough now.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.093
We don't say anything back,

16:09.176 --> 16:11.596
we just go forward, and trust me,
I'll get it fixed.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.647
[Ed Holly] All right, I will be home.

16:22.190 --> 16:26.027
I will not be home at all this week
for supper.

16:26.110 --> 16:29.614
[Holly] What about Friday night?
Friday night, she has another dance...

16:29.697 --> 16:31.377
- thing on Friday.
- [girl] I have dance...

16:31.448 --> 16:33.075
Does that mean
the three boys have to go?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.326
- Oh.
- [boy] Oh.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.651
What time is your dance Friday?

16:35.703 --> 16:37.747
I dance from 6:30
for the rest of the night.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.917
- Tuesday I have it from 5:30 to... 9:00.
- Um...

16:41.000 --> 16:41.834
[Holly] 4:00 to 5:30.

16:41.918 --> 16:45.046
I will do my best
to get off this, um... Yeah...

16:45.129 --> 16:46.899
- [Holly] At 4:00. Not gonna happen.
- [boy] We can come.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.674
That's not gonna happen
'cause I'm gonna be

16:48.758 --> 16:50.760
in North Mississippi till Friday.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.012
- 4:00 to 5:30.
- [boy] Can I come with you?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.056
- I wish, buddy.
- [Holly] <i>We met at Florida.</i>

16:55.139 --> 16:57.642
At the University of Florida.
Go Gators. Uh, I saw him

16:57.725 --> 17:00.352
and he came up and started talking
to me and he said,

17:00.436 --> 17:01.877
"What's your name?" I said, "Holly."

17:01.938 --> 17:04.538
And he goes, "My name's Ed Holly."
And I was like, "No, it's not."

17:04.566 --> 17:06.846
[chuckles] So he took out his license
and showed it to me,

17:06.901 --> 17:08.736
and I was like, "Whatever."

17:08.820 --> 17:10.572
You're just some guy I just met.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.282
- [girl] Good job, Daddy.
- That was the master plan.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.909
[all laugh]

17:14.992 --> 17:17.012
- [Holly] It is very hectic.
- [children chattering]

17:17.036 --> 17:18.436
It's very hectic during the season.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.165
We've been married 19 years
and we've moved...

17:21.248 --> 17:24.001
- um... I think 12.
- A lot.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.485
Well, this was, like, our 13th move

17:25.545 --> 17:27.630
so we've moved a lot.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.383
We didn't hang pictures 'cause I thought,

17:30.842 --> 17:32.009
"It's too close to December."

17:32.093 --> 17:34.637
And every coach's wife in America

17:34.721 --> 17:37.098
holds their breath for the month
of December and January

17:37.181 --> 17:40.309
because coaches get fired,
coaches get hired and coaches move.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.936
And if I hang pictures on the wall...

17:42.019 --> 17:44.939
if I buy a rug,
if I buy a dining room table...

17:45.397 --> 17:46.733
then we're gonna move.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.359
Then it's just Murphy's Law

17:48.442 --> 17:50.277
that something will happen and come up

17:50.361 --> 17:52.446
and we'll move again so,
no pictures on the wall.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.575
If we make it through this December
and January with nothing happening...

17:55.658 --> 17:56.868
February...

17:56.951 --> 17:58.620
I'm gonna hang pictures up.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.038
[laughs] Then we'll move
into the house officially.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.679
[players chattering indistinctly]

18:21.684 --> 18:23.770
[Wagner] Why are your hand
in your pants? Really?

18:23.853 --> 18:25.146
[Kam] Huh?

18:25.229 --> 18:26.629
- [Wagner] Really?
- [player 1] Bro.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.315
Bro.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.152
Bro, wake up.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.821
[chuckles] Get up, bro.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.576
- [snorts and grunts]
- [player 2] Shit, boy.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.083
Damn.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.090
Man, I'm tired as fuck.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.928
[Tim] Hey, Brit, somebody smoked
a cigarette and put it out right there...

18:57.011 --> 18:58.262
You been smoking that Black.

18:58.346 --> 19:01.932
- Terrell "Scrubs," huh?
- [Kam] Fuck with my damn jersey again.

19:02.016 --> 19:05.186
[Wagner] Tim,
can we leave him alone please?

19:05.645 --> 19:09.357
[Williams] Now, let me tell you something.
Today is the wrong day...

19:10.107 --> 19:13.945
to come out there
and not run to the football. Okay?

19:14.028 --> 19:17.489
I don't care if the doggone ball carrier
run 30 yards down the field.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.241
Run to the ball.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.995
You only got two practices out the week.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.081
But I am warnin' you right now.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.875
Okay? Nicely.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.127
- [players chuckle]
- All right? You see this, right?

19:30.211 --> 19:33.172
I am warning you right now, okay?

19:33.255 --> 19:36.926
If you guys do not run to the football,
it's gonna be trouble in the water.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.136
And that's comin' from up top.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.180
I'm telling you now, do not come...

19:41.263 --> 19:43.933
I don't care
where your feelings at right now,

19:44.016 --> 19:46.602
I don't care what's going on
in your life right now,

19:46.686 --> 19:49.689
but if your ass ain't running
to that ball, there's gonna be trouble.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.358
All right, walk towards 255, hurry up.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.027
Come on, Kam!
Stop going through the damn motions.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.946
[Ed Holly] Let's go.
We should be already done

19:57.029 --> 19:58.572
with this whole fucking drill.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.159
[Williams] Run, run! Run, Kam! Run, Kam!

20:02.243 --> 20:05.496
Do you know where to run, son?
Do you know where to run?

20:05.579 --> 20:06.747
Let's go!

20:06.914 --> 20:09.583
Hey, this is why we can't get lined up
when we tired!

20:09.667 --> 20:12.044
This why we damn have missed tackles
when we tired!

20:14.546 --> 20:16.257
[indistinct chatter]

20:16.340 --> 20:18.760
I ain't even gonna lie to you, man.
Not today.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.679
Run, run to the ball!

20:22.764 --> 20:24.849
[player yelling indistinctly]

20:25.808 --> 20:27.143
Hurry up, hurry up!

20:29.645 --> 20:32.774
Hey, man, you gotta run to the ball, son.
I told you. Run to the ball!

20:32.857 --> 20:34.776
[Chauncey] I can't.
He already out of bounds.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.778
Don't matter!
Keep running your ass out there!

20:36.861 --> 20:39.363
- [speaks indistinctly]
- Run to the fucking ball!

20:42.784 --> 20:45.702
We will run all day long till we get it!

20:47.621 --> 20:49.123
Forty-two damn points.

20:49.206 --> 20:52.001
[Williams] Let's go, Chauncey.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.127
Hurry up, son!

20:53.710 --> 20:56.672

22:24.969 --> 22:26.178

It's gonna be hard. Because we're...
Everyone's thinking about it.

Oh, yeah.

It took the ability for you to have
a chance to win that first ball game.

I just look to get a little payback.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.804
[Isaiah] That nigga in thug mode.
He got the hat backwards.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.473
[Buddy] Hey, nothing but touchdowns.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.350
[Crowder] <i>Wright's to the right</i>
<i>of Johnson.</i>

30:09.433 --> 30:11.518
<i>He takes a snap,
leaves it with Isaiah Wright.</i>

30:11.602 --> 30:13.770
<i>Looks around near side,
trying to angle past...</i>

30:13.854 --> 30:15.606
- [whistle blows]
- [coach yelling]

30:17.065 --> 30:18.692
[Wood] Come on! He's tackled here.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.361
[Winfield] <i>Got a late hit on that play.</i>

30:20.444 --> 30:22.571
<i>Tackle out of bounds,
but the flag did not come.</i>

30:22.654 --> 30:24.406
[Buddy] Time out! God dang it!

30:24.490 --> 30:25.824
[Isaiah] That's bullshit, dog.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.993
Oh, no, no. You're wrong. Call...

30:28.076 --> 30:30.746
Hey, call the game, not because it's Delta
but call the game

30:30.829 --> 30:32.590
- like you're supposed to.
- I ain't worried.

30:32.623 --> 30:36.460
You are too because... Hey, hey.
No, hey! Call it right!

30:36.543 --> 30:38.313
- Understand? I don't need nobody hurt.
- Come on.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.482
- [Buddy] Talk to me straight!
- [Isaiah] Coach Stephens...

30:40.506 --> 30:43.509
- Coach Stephens, come on. Come on.
- [clamoring]

30:43.592 --> 30:45.010
[growling]

30:46.762 --> 30:50.682
Referee, uh, I don't think they're paying
too much attention right now.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.183
They're trying to help him out.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.521
They feel sorry for him, but they're
gonna probably feel sorry for him.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.481
They probably just callin' it like it is.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.149
[growling]

31:02.361 --> 31:03.612
That's a mad growl.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.047
[Crowder] <i>Clock rolling</i>
<i>in the second quarter.</i>

31:05.071 --> 31:07.198
[Winfield] <i>Gonna be</i>
<i>an interesting decision here.</i>

31:07.282 --> 31:09.368
<i>Do you use a time out,
force them to punt?</i>

31:09.451 --> 31:10.553
[Buddy] Want me to call time out?

31:10.577 --> 31:12.013
[Wood] I want the ball
if we can get the ball.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.580
[Crowder] <i>Eerily similar to last year.</i>

31:13.664 --> 31:14.891
[Buddy] Want me to call time out?

31:14.915 --> 31:17.333
[Wood] <i>I do. I want you to call time out.</i>
<i>I want the ball.</i>

31:17.418 --> 31:18.478
[Buddy] Want me to call time out?

31:18.502 --> 31:19.604
[Wood] I would love for you to.

31:19.628 --> 31:20.462
[player] You can.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.815
- [Wood] I would call time out.
- [Buddy] It's not against the rules.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.359
[Crowder] <i>They'll turn</i>
<i>and leave it with Haymon.</i>

31:24.383 --> 31:27.428
<i>Haymon bounces behind left tackle.
Can he get up to the 49-yard line?</i>

31:27.511 --> 31:29.012
<i>- Ball's gonna come out!</i>
- [cheering]

31:29.095 --> 31:32.307
<i>EMCC ball on the far sideline,
inside the 25!</i>

31:32.391 --> 31:36.812
<i>Twenty, ten, five. Touchdown, EMCC!</i>

31:37.729 --> 31:38.897
<i>Oh, goodness!</i>

31:38.980 --> 31:42.734
<i>Picks up a fumble and marches
some 50 yards down the field...</i>

31:42.818 --> 31:44.319
- [Buddy] Good job.
- [coach laughs]

31:44.403 --> 31:46.113
- [Winfield] <i>You kidding?</i>
- [Isaiah] Hey...

31:46.196 --> 31:48.615
- [Crowder] <i>No way that just happened.</i>
- [player] Yes, sir!

31:48.699 --> 31:50.409
<i>That's gonna be a 50-yard sweeping score,</i>

31:50.492 --> 31:53.537
<i>and EMCC will have
a 45-7 lead at the half...</i>

31:53.620 --> 31:54.972
- [Winfield] <i>And keep the time out.</i>
- [Crowder] <i>Right.</i>

31:54.996 --> 31:57.123
[Wood] You didn't need the time out.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.350
[Buddy] Didn't have to call time out.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.561
[Wood] You didn't call time out.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.920
[player] Hey, guys, we made to halftime.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.323
- [laughs]
- [Buddy] Great job, D!

32:03.379 --> 32:05.966
Atta way to run around
and smoke 'em in the head.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.009
Defense, offense get in the back room.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.178
You got a 26-minute halftime.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.305
We're going out with seven minutes left.

32:12.388 --> 32:14.933
We are gonna lathered up
like a great horse does,

32:15.016 --> 32:16.768
and then we gonna keep whooping that ass.

Hey, Coach.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.085
- Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you, man.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.046
[Crowder] <i>And they're showing</i>
<i>great sportsmanship now at midfield.</i>

34:08.129 --> 34:10.340

<i>and they're all bowing their heads

34:13.218 --> 34:16.054
Lord, again, we thank you
for your love for us.

34:16.137 --> 34:19.182
We just thank you that you would send
your son to die for each one of us.

34:19.265 --> 34:20.266
Yes, Lord.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.435
[Clark] Lord, we thank you
that you've given us

34:22.518 --> 34:24.730
the ability to play this great game.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.248
- [coach] Yes, Lord.
- [Clark] And Lord, we pray

34:26.272 --> 34:29.234
that we will continue
to play for your glory.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.194
[coach] Fellas,
the most important decision

34:31.277 --> 34:33.947
you can ever make in your life
is to know Jesus.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.907
Football will pass away.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.701
Know him, in your heart.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.078
Proud of all of y'all.
God bless you. Amen.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.955
- [all] Amen.
- [Buddy] Hey! Our Father...

34:42.038 --> 34:43.999
[all] Who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.877
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on Earth as in Heaven.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.419
Give us today our daily bread...

34:48.503 --> 34:51.590
Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.724
[Buddy] <i>We went to church like every...</i>
<i>Like, like other people</i>

35:00.807 --> 35:03.351
<i>because that's what we thought
we were supposed to do and...</i>

35:03.434 --> 35:06.354
Mainly it was, you know,
me and my brother, we'd go to church,

35:06.437 --> 35:08.940
ride the church bus, on Sundays.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.153
I don't ever remember
going to church as a family.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.697
I don't think that happened many times.

35:20.327 --> 35:24.039
Were the apostles appointed or...

35:25.123 --> 35:27.208
did the apostles see Jesus?

35:27.292 --> 35:30.545
Was that something, that they saw Jesus
and then followed Jesus?

35:31.129 --> 35:35.341
[Davis] <i>We sat down and he just,</i>
<i>pretty much, bared his soul, I guess.</i>

35:35.425 --> 35:38.094
<i>He said that he wanted to change.</i>

35:38.178 --> 35:42.598
One of the things I asked Buddy,
if he knew the Lord.

35:42.683 --> 35:46.394
After that is when Buddy got
with his pastor

35:46.477 --> 35:49.230
and got all his things
worked out with the Lord.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.524
We can do all the good deeds in the world,

35:51.607 --> 35:52.901
but until we...

35:52.984 --> 35:56.863
[stammers] until we recognize Jesus Christ
as the son of God,

35:56.947 --> 35:58.573
all those good deeds don't matter.

35:58.657 --> 36:02.452
[Davis] <i>I put my hand</i>
<i>on his shoulder and I said, "Buddy,</i>

36:02.535 --> 36:04.120
you need to understand

36:04.204 --> 36:07.165
that the devil sure would like

36:07.248 --> 36:12.754
for you to just completely blow up
and go old school."

36:13.254 --> 36:18.176
It's easy to get out of
living for the Lord.

36:18.259 --> 36:21.596
Uh, just because you let him in

36:21.680 --> 36:26.184
doesn't mean you're going to change
and stay changed.

36:26.267 --> 36:30.731
[stammers] <i>But I just...</i>
<i>I think Buddy's come this far,</i>

36:30.814 --> 36:34.234
I'd really be disappointed
if he doesn't ride this thing out.

36:34.317 --> 36:39.030
And, uh, there's gonna be
a new Buddy Stephens.

36:41.616 --> 36:45.411
I was talking to someone and, um, she was
like, "Wait, your dad's the coach?

36:45.495 --> 36:46.872
He is a bad dude."

36:46.955 --> 36:50.458
I was like... "Well, that's,
you know, not hurtful." [laughs]

36:50.541 --> 36:52.043
Like, okay.

36:52.127 --> 36:56.381
<i>I think he's definitely dealing with
51 years of not following Christ.</i>

36:56.464 --> 36:59.968
<i>Like, when you live that long
and establish your roots,</i>

37:00.051 --> 37:02.595
<i>of course you're gonna be
wrestling with it.</i>

37:02.678 --> 37:05.891
And so, we're not gonna instantly become
what we want to be.

37:05.974 --> 37:10.812
And we're not instantly going to be
this super Christian or anything.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.481
He's just like anybody else.
He makes mistakes.

37:13.564 --> 37:14.983
Just because he has a camera on him

37:15.066 --> 37:17.235
and a bunch of people
looking to see what he does next,

37:17.318 --> 37:18.779
doesn't mean he's not human.

37:18.862 --> 37:21.364
And so, he's gonna
make those mistakes, so...

37:21.656 --> 37:23.366
[Buddy] <i>We talked about all of us</i>

37:24.325 --> 37:26.202
trying to do better at...
at all of our stuff.

37:26.286 --> 37:30.123
Me, especially with my language,
I try to do better and I...

37:30.206 --> 37:33.418
I know that there's people here
going through the same struggle...

37:34.210 --> 37:38.506
whether it be as a football player
or whether it be as a Christian

37:38.589 --> 37:41.467
[stutters] or whether it be as a student.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.970
Whether it be as a son or a brother.

37:44.554 --> 37:47.307
I think we all...
Everybody out here wants to do good.

37:47.390 --> 37:50.685
Everybody out here wants to be good. Okay?

37:50.769 --> 37:56.107
But, like me, you gotta make that promise
to myself and to you and to my God.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.193
Iron sharpens iron.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.403
When you see your teammates
stepping out of line,

38:00.486 --> 38:03.531
whether it be out here on the field,
in the classroom, in the dorm,

38:03.614 --> 38:05.283
check him, okay? Check him.

38:05.366 --> 38:08.078
You see me stepping out of line, check.
"See, Coach..."

38:08.161 --> 38:10.580
- [players laughing]
- [chuckles] All right.

38:10.663 --> 38:13.917
[stammering] I brought that one
on myself. All right.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.794
I'm a maker of my own misery.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.922
Keep your team in your prayers, all right?
Reeve, lead us.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.382
[all] Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.301
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

38:30.600 --> 38:32.393
[Dakota] Hey, what's going on, Coach?

38:32.477 --> 38:36.481
Season's good. We're preparing
for Holmes this week, so...

38:36.898 --> 38:39.400
We got a pretty good run-stop defense,
so we should be...

38:39.484 --> 38:41.152
We should be able to handle them.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.614
I've been playing the game
for so long, you know.

38:44.697 --> 38:49.244
I just feel like I have a high IQ
of, like, where the ball is gonna be.

38:49.661 --> 38:53.039
[spits] Yeah... yeah, yeah. Instinctive.
Yeah, yeah, that's the word.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.835
Yeah, really, I'm just looking for a...

38:56.918 --> 39:01.172
for a place that's just willing to give me
a second chance, to be honest, you know.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.969
[Wood] Hey, man. There's a bunch of ham
and sandwich stuff in here.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.220
Y'all gonna come get one.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.431
Glad you're here. Love it.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.183
All right. What we talk about every week.

39:12.267 --> 39:15.061
Don't accept anything I say.

39:15.145 --> 39:17.105
You gotta look it up. Go back and find it.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.607
Prove it. It's gotta be something
that comes from that Bible.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.069
We talk about it all the time.
Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth.

39:23.153 --> 39:24.612
So, I gotta make sure I understand

39:24.695 --> 39:26.697
we're here to talk about the Bible,
nothing else.

39:26.781 --> 39:30.702
Last week, we talked
about the enemy being who?

39:31.286 --> 39:32.662
- [players] The devil.
- The devil.

39:32.745 --> 39:36.374
And we talked about the fact
that he prowls around like a roaring lion.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.877
So, we're aware that he's out there.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.211
Genesis 39...

39:40.295 --> 39:42.005
Who wants to read that? Anybody?

39:42.088 --> 39:43.131
I got it.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.592
"She grabbed him by the garment
and said, 'Sleep with me.'

39:46.676 --> 39:51.014
But leave... But leaving his garment
in her hand, he escaped and ran outside."

39:51.806 --> 39:52.933
[player sighs]

39:53.016 --> 39:54.184
[coach] That's pretty tough.

39:54.267 --> 39:57.645
[stammering] I understand.
I mean, I was you all's age.

39:57.728 --> 39:58.980
I'm a young man now.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.941
You know, when a woman
comes at you like that,

40:01.024 --> 40:02.525
how many of us
can sit there and say,

40:02.608 --> 40:04.485
"No. No, thank you. I ain't about that"?

40:04.569 --> 40:07.072
You know what I mean?
That's not the easiest thing to do.

40:07.155 --> 40:10.783
Well, like you said, like,
God allowed Joseph to have everything.

40:10.866 --> 40:15.580
Wouldn't it be easier to say no
to temptation if you just had everything?

40:15.663 --> 40:17.665
[Wood] Yes. Is it easier if I have,

40:17.748 --> 40:19.918
to say, "Well, I don't have to do this"?
Sure.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.503
If I'm a guy that's hungry
and I'm out on the street

40:22.587 --> 40:24.130
and I hadn't eaten a meal in days,

40:24.214 --> 40:26.925
how easy would it be for me to say,
"I'm gonna steal to eat."

40:27.008 --> 40:30.011
But at the end of the day,
that's still a choice I have to make.

40:31.221 --> 40:32.805
[Dakota] <i>I grew up in a nice home.</i>

40:32.888 --> 40:35.600
<i>My father and my mother
really cared about me.</i>

40:35.683 --> 40:39.145
After everything at Texas Tech,
they were disappointed.

40:39.229 --> 40:41.356
And, you know,
I don't blame them for that, you know.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.899
[stutters] I understand,
you know, I messed up.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.861
People make mistakes every day, so...

40:46.945 --> 40:49.530
[Wood] The temptation was there.
I had to learn endure stuff.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.950
[Dakota] <i>After everything that happened,</i>

40:52.033 --> 40:55.120
I was getting phone calls from...
from, really, everybody.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.705
I mean, family members,
not-family members,

40:57.788 --> 41:00.458
people who were just being nosy,
wanted to know.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.793
And one thing
a lot of 'em had in common was

41:02.877 --> 41:05.630
they always said
just pray about it, you know,

41:05.713 --> 41:11.219
God has a plan for you, just keep praying.
And so, then I started to pray, every day.

41:11.719 --> 41:17.183
Just prayed every day and then just slowly
and surely, miracles started to happen,

41:17.267 --> 41:20.228
<i>like my case got dropped
and not even a day later,</i>

41:20.311 --> 41:24.815
<i>East Mississippi offers me a scholarship
to come play football again.</i>

41:24.899 --> 41:26.567
<i>Something I love to do, so...</i>

41:26.651 --> 41:29.904
I mean, that's what really made me...

41:29.988 --> 41:33.449
Made me find faith in Christ.

41:34.867 --> 41:38.538
How many y'all saw guys that you played
that you may have been better than?

41:38.621 --> 41:39.789
Or you played over?

41:39.872 --> 41:42.708
And they would still get offers
and sometimes you didn't get offers.

41:42.792 --> 41:45.420
Sometimes you're getting discouraged
about the recruiting process.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.344
You got different things going on
in your mind.

41:47.422 --> 41:50.675
But what you gotta realize is,
it's gonna happen in due time,

41:50.758 --> 41:52.135
when it's supposed to happen.

41:52.218 --> 41:55.305
And I may have a dream
of playing at such and such,

41:55.388 --> 41:57.932
but I may not be meant to
play at such and such.

41:58.724 --> 42:01.477
I may be more destined
to play over here instead of here.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.729
[exhales] I like that.

42:03.813 --> 42:07.150
[Wood] And what a powerful deal that is.
All for maybe a detour.

42:07.734 --> 42:09.986
You're in Texas, and then you're here.

42:10.069 --> 42:13.698
And something big's gonna happen for you.
But you had to detour here.

42:14.157 --> 42:18.619
Now, that wasn't the original plan,
that doesn't mean my road has to end.

42:18.703 --> 42:21.872
Just means I got to take another path
to get back to where I need to get to.

42:22.957 --> 42:26.669
[Jay] <i>That bible class though.</i>
<i>Well needed, man. It's needed.</i>

42:27.295 --> 42:30.423
I ain't living no perfect life.
You ain't living no perfect life.

42:30.506 --> 42:31.841
[player] Nobody perfect, man.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.259
We ain't living no perfect life.

42:33.343 --> 42:36.971
- High school, bro, I was bad.
- [player] I already know...

42:37.055 --> 42:40.891
I got a homeboy raisin' up,
a close cousin raisin' up...

42:41.976 --> 42:44.770
Every time you seen him, you seen me.

42:44.854 --> 42:48.983
But... but he doing...
He doing time in jail right now.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.860
I know I probably be right there with him.

42:51.486 --> 42:54.739
[stutters] I wasn't supposed to be
in school right now, period.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.367
I'm supposed to be back home,
on the street,

42:57.450 --> 43:00.495
doing what everybody else is doing
because so many people doubted me.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.622
By my 11th-grade year, bro,

43:02.705 --> 43:06.834
I realized that, you know, maybe it's time
for me to, you know, you know...

43:06.917 --> 43:07.918
[player] Get right.

43:08.002 --> 43:10.755
You know, get my life back.
I got a scholarship.

43:11.547 --> 43:13.258
I ain't never thought
I was gonna get that.

43:13.341 --> 43:16.386
I wasn't livin' right.
And to this day, I still wonder

43:16.469 --> 43:18.263
why is he still blessing me?

43:18.346 --> 43:19.866
[Dakota] You got a purpose. It's wild.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.350
It's a purpose. It's a purpose.
I don't know my purpose yet.

43:22.433 --> 43:25.186
You got it. He gonna show you, bro.
Purpose, he gonna show you that.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.687
I don't know my purpose yet.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.731
He gonna show... Bro, I...
Listen, bro.

43:28.814 --> 43:31.066
- I'm ready for it.
- He gonna show you the purpose.

43:31.151 --> 43:33.351
You just gotta stay with him, bro.
I'm telling you, bro.

43:33.403 --> 43:36.531
[stutters] I'm still trying to find
what my purpose is.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.450
Just how we talking right now, bro.
Talk to him, bro.

43:39.534 --> 43:40.618
Don't beat around the bush.

43:40.701 --> 43:42.370
Talk to him. Just how we're talking now.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.955
Hey, I'm gonna pray for y'all, man.
For sure.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.499
[player] Hey, I got you too, my boy.

43:46.582 --> 43:47.875
All right.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.294
[indistinct chatter]

43:52.463 --> 43:53.881
What about Dakota, 40?

43:53.964 --> 43:55.925
Gotta have him. As far as carries.

43:56.008 --> 43:58.761
[Freeze] So, you would rank
the, uh, backers, definitely take Dakota.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.471
[Collins] Absolutely. He's a baller.

44:03.974 --> 44:06.227
[Buddy] Hey,
the kid that I really think's the,

44:06.311 --> 44:10.440
maybe, the sleeper out of all of 'em
is Isaiah Wright. The running back.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.817
That's the running back receiver.

44:12.900 --> 44:16.279
The kid that was on ESPN leaving
from the five-yard line and...

44:16.362 --> 44:18.323
- You know, you saw that one? Four.
- What number?

44:21.284 --> 44:22.535
[Isaiah exclaims]

44:22.618 --> 44:24.829
[player] One more! One more. Keep going.

44:24.912 --> 44:27.290
He got me fucked up.
He ain't figured out his shit.

44:30.585 --> 44:31.836
[Isaiah yells]

44:32.503 --> 44:33.713
Yeah!

44:33.796 --> 44:35.923
[Buddy] Brother signed
with Indiana last year.

44:36.006 --> 44:38.343
He's just a phenomenal athlete.

44:38.426 --> 44:42.388
Florida State and uh, Auburn have offered.
He's the one that I think's...

44:42.472 --> 44:43.473
[Freeze] Mid-year?

44:43.556 --> 44:45.600
[Buddy] Yes.
He's the one I think is special.

44:45.683 --> 44:48.102
He's just...
He's the best athlete on the field

44:48.186 --> 44:50.480
when he's on the field. I'm just telling.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.726
[radio host] <i>Isaiah, it's been weeks</i>
<i>since you've been</i>

44:53.774 --> 44:55.776
<i>out there a whole game.
How good was it to be back?</i>

44:55.860 --> 44:59.113
[Isaiah over radio] <i>Yeah. I felt amazing</i>
<i>to be back. I'm glad to come back.</i>

44:59.196 --> 45:01.907
<i>Help my boys come out with another win.</i>

45:01.991 --> 45:03.368
<i>It feels good to be back.</i>

45:03.451 --> 45:04.702
[host] <i>You've been banged up</i>

45:04.785 --> 45:06.496
<i>last couple of weeks.
How do you feel now?</i>

45:06.579 --> 45:07.872
[Isaiah] <i>Oh, I feel like</i>

45:07.955 --> 45:12.502
<i>after a football game.
It's... I feel relieved.</i>

45:12.585 --> 45:13.854
- [host] <i>Relieved?</i>
- [Isaiah] <i>Relieved.</i>

45:13.878 --> 45:15.380
<i>Yeah, ready to go. Relieved.</i>

45:15.463 --> 45:17.423
[host] <i>Good.</i>
<i>We'll be ready to see you next week.</i>

45:17.507 --> 45:19.342
- [Isaiah] <i>Thank you.</i>
<i>- Good to see ya.</i>

45:19.425 --> 45:20.968
<i>All right, that was Isaiah Wright,</i>

45:21.051 --> 45:23.596
<i>uh, outstanding effort tonight.
Three touchdowns...</i>

45:23.679 --> 45:24.972
[Isaiah] I ain't vote this shit.

45:25.055 --> 45:27.725
I ain't 'bout to vote for
none of them motherfuckers.

45:27.808 --> 45:29.935
- Donald ass wanna send us back.
- [player] Aye.

45:30.019 --> 45:33.314
Hillary don't know
what the fuck she doing. I mean...

45:33.398 --> 45:35.078
[player] Lemme tell you. If I was to vote,

45:35.149 --> 45:37.777
I'd vote for, uh...
What that nigga name? Sanders, y'all.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.112
Sanders! Yeah! I'd vote for Sanders.

45:40.195 --> 45:41.572
[player] You could vote for him.

45:41.656 --> 45:42.907
You gotta check "other."

45:42.990 --> 45:45.310
- Check "other" and put Sanders.
- [player] Write his name.

45:45.576 --> 45:46.619
Let's see.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.746
[Isaiah] Let me show you
what I'm about to get.

45:48.829 --> 45:49.830
[man] You getting that?

45:49.914 --> 45:52.124
Yeah. You see I'm getting that.
She getting the other.

45:53.459 --> 45:54.460
[man] Ooh!

45:59.298 --> 46:00.508
[Isaiah] What up with it, boy?

46:01.091 --> 46:05.262
[man] When I get done with everybody's
tats tonight, they gonna be sleeping good.

46:05.346 --> 46:07.222
- [Isaiah chuckles]
- [man] Yeah!

46:08.641 --> 46:11.519
[Jazlyn] <i>I mean,</i>
<i>I just woke up and I was sick.</i>

46:12.895 --> 46:14.536
And I sat there and looked at my calendar

46:14.605 --> 46:17.400
and I was like, "Oh, look at that."

46:17.483 --> 46:19.735
I was like,
"All this stuff is adding up."

46:20.861 --> 46:22.905
[tattoo machine whirring]

46:27.452 --> 46:29.954
[Jazlyn] <i>He was like,</i>
<i>"You think I'm gonna be a good dad?"</i>

46:30.037 --> 46:31.914
<i>And I'm like,
"Yeah, you gonna be a good dad.</i>

46:31.998 --> 46:34.000
<i>You don't have anything to worry about."</i>

46:34.709 --> 46:37.002
[Isaiah] <i>I mean, yeah, but I mean,</i>
<i>I want a child.</i>

46:37.086 --> 46:40.005
I mean, I just feel like I love kids.
I feel like I'm...

46:40.089 --> 46:42.133
I'll be a great father, to be honest.

46:44.552 --> 46:46.178
[Jazlyn] <i>We panicked at the beginning.</i>

46:46.261 --> 46:48.931
<i>But, after that, like,
everything I needed,</i>

46:49.014 --> 46:51.058
he found a way to get it to me.

46:52.017 --> 46:54.479
<i>He was like, "Yeah, I'm young."
But, he was, like,</i>

46:54.562 --> 46:56.814
<i>"It's here." He's like,
"Whether I'm happy or not,</i>

46:56.897 --> 47:00.693
<i>I kinda have no choice but to be happy
about it. Like, it's gonna be mine."</i>

47:01.861 --> 47:05.280
<i>He, like, changed his whole mindset.
"I gotta do better."</i>

47:05.365 --> 47:08.451
<i>He's like, "I know what I have to do
and I know I gotta do it."</i>

47:08.534 --> 47:10.536
[tattoo machine whirring]

47:10.620 --> 47:14.039
He's like, "I'm preparing myself."
And I said, "I'm preparing myself, too."

47:14.123 --> 47:16.792
So, we can be the best that we can be.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.170
We got to.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.940
- [man] "One life, one love."
- [Isaiah] She got the "One love."

47:21.964 --> 47:23.048
[Jazlyn] Love.

47:23.132 --> 47:25.510
- [man] So, is this your first tattoo?
- [Jazlyn] Hmm.

47:25.593 --> 47:27.011
[man] You nervous?

47:28.137 --> 47:30.978
[Jazlyn] <i>And I think it's because of all</i>
<i>of that that he's been through,</i>

47:31.056 --> 47:33.308
he's like, "I can give
the love that I didn't get."

47:33.393 --> 47:36.521
That's what he told me.
"I can give the love that I didn't get."

47:36.604 --> 47:38.124
- [man] Here?
- [Isaiah] Letters first.

47:38.188 --> 47:40.566
- [man] Letter, yeah.
- Why we doing the letters first?

47:40.650 --> 47:42.711
[Isaiah] 'Cause that's the hardest.
Gonna get that done,

47:42.735 --> 47:45.506
- 'cause that's close to the bone.
- [Jazlyn] No, I don't wanna get it.

47:45.530 --> 47:46.739
[tattoo machine whirring]

47:46.822 --> 47:47.948
[man] You gonna listen?

47:48.449 --> 47:49.742
[whirring intensifies]

47:51.536 --> 47:55.706
[grunts] Okay. Now that part hurt.
When he started, yeah, it hurt.

47:56.832 --> 47:58.459
[Jazlyn] <i>He calls me every day.</i>

47:58.543 --> 48:02.212
<i>He makes sure I eat right.
He makes sure I get what I need.</i>

48:02.838 --> 48:06.426
<i>Yeah, it's gonna be hard, but he's there.</i>

48:09.303 --> 48:10.304
[Isaiah] <i>Shit, I mean,</i>

48:10.387 --> 48:13.558
<i>I been through six years of foster care.
I done lived by myself.</i>

48:13.641 --> 48:16.769
Six of us with one egg
and two bags of oatmeal.

48:16.852 --> 48:21.566
So, I mean, the struggle since birth...
I mean, we can handle it.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.785
[indistinct chatter]

48:35.037 --> 48:36.581
Ready, stretch.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.373
Where would you rather be
than on the field

48:38.458 --> 48:39.810
at East Mississippi Community College?

48:39.834 --> 48:41.168
Can't think of a better place.

48:41.251 --> 48:43.921
All day long, 24 hours a day.

48:44.004 --> 48:46.274
You can break up with your girlfriend,
get a new girlfriend.

48:46.298 --> 48:48.985
Get two girlfriends. You gotta love
playing East Mississippi football.

48:49.009 --> 48:50.511
It's what we do.

48:50.595 --> 48:53.973
We get an opportunity to do what we do
and do what we love now.

48:54.056 --> 48:56.892
We gonna have a great practice.
Not a good practice.

48:56.976 --> 48:59.186
Do I have great expectations
for tomorrow night? Yes.

48:59.269 --> 49:02.940
Do I expect to set records at
East Mississippi in a positive way? Yes.

49:03.023 --> 49:05.943
Do I expect our guys
to fly around the football? Yes.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.862
But is it another challenge? Absolutely.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.864
<i>What's troubling about Holmes</i>

49:09.947 --> 49:11.842
<i>is they have a different offense
than we're used to.</i>

49:11.866 --> 49:14.744
<i>Three guys can carry
the ball at any given time.</i>

49:14.827 --> 49:16.370
And they also can throw the ball.

49:16.453 --> 49:20.457
Big game Thursday night now.
Gotta take it on the road.

49:20.541 --> 49:23.002
[Williams] <i>This is gonna be</i>
<i>an ugly game tomorrow night.</i>

49:23.085 --> 49:25.129
All because of what they do.

49:25.212 --> 49:27.464
It's a frustrating game to coach against.

49:27.548 --> 49:30.551
Because of what they do.
But we got you guys ready.

49:30.635 --> 49:33.095
All the fakes, all the motions,
all the tricks that they do.

49:33.178 --> 49:36.641
This is a big deal.
Pay attention. Pay attention.

49:36.724 --> 49:40.811
[Williams] You number five in the country,
but you're number one in our minds.

49:40.895 --> 49:43.731
When we recruited you,
you are a number one football team.

49:43.814 --> 49:47.484
You're the number one defensive line
in the state and in the country.

49:47.568 --> 49:49.444
We need y'all to play
like that tomorrow night.

49:49.529 --> 49:51.864
[Ed Holly clapping] Remember,
you are the chosen one, baby.

49:51.947 --> 49:53.448
You are the chosen one!

49:53.533 --> 49:55.910
<i>We feel we're the best rushing defense
in the country.</i>

49:55.993 --> 49:58.120
<i>And they're the best rushing offense
in the state.</i>

49:58.203 --> 50:00.706
So, it's gonna be a battle of Titans,
Thursday night.

50:02.958 --> 50:04.501
[sizzling]

50:05.920 --> 50:08.023
[Crowder] <i>Good evening and welcome</i>
<i>to Ras Branch Stadium</i>

50:08.047 --> 50:10.215
<i>on the campus of Holmes Community College.</i>

50:10.299 --> 50:11.759
<i>It's a top 20 battle tonight</i>

50:11.842 --> 50:15.721
<i>between number 5, EMCC,
and number 16, Holmes,</i>

50:15.805 --> 50:20.267
<i>with that get-down-the-field offense
and of course, that triple-option attack.</i>

50:21.060 --> 50:24.479
[Winfield] <i>EMCC, no margin of error if</i>
<i>they want to work their way up the polls.</i>

50:24.564 --> 50:26.607
<i>Love to add another resume win.</i>

50:26.691 --> 50:29.026
[Buddy] <i>This thing's gonna be won</i>
<i>by the bunch that's...</i>

50:29.109 --> 50:30.469
<i>That wants to be most disciplined.</i>

50:30.861 --> 50:33.280
You're more athletic.
You're a better football team.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.124
You're better football players
than they are.

50:35.199 --> 50:37.034
- You gotta want it more.
- [player] Yes, sir.

50:37.117 --> 50:39.453
Hey. You gotta go out,
lay an ass-whooping on them.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.496
That's it. Go out there
and bust their ass now.

50:41.581 --> 50:43.749
Punch 'em in the mouth
and let's get after it.

50:43.832 --> 50:45.753
Everybody, grab a knee,
everybody touch somebody.

50:46.251 --> 50:47.294
[player yells]

50:48.003 --> 50:49.314
[Crowder] <i>Here's the snap</i>
<i>at the knees to Johnson.</i>

50:49.338 --> 50:51.674
<i>He's looking near side,
throws it left has a man,</i>

50:51.757 --> 50:55.761
<i>caught by Lanier.
Touchdown, EMCC from 27 yards out.</i>

50:55.845 --> 50:57.387
<i>And the Lions score first.</i>

50:57.471 --> 51:00.557
[coach] <i>Let's go, baby!</i>
<i>Let's rock and roll. Let's go!</i>

51:03.686 --> 51:06.689
They cannot hang with us. There is no way.

51:06.772 --> 51:08.482
[Crowder] <i>Let's see</i>
<i>what Holmes can do.</i>

51:08.565 --> 51:09.793
[Winfield] <i>Question is going to be,</i>

51:09.817 --> 51:14.113
<i>can that Lion defense obey
its assignments, not try to be the hero,</i>

51:14.196 --> 51:15.948
<i>make the plays it's supposed to make...</i>

51:16.031 --> 51:17.718
[Crowder] <i>Here's the snap.</i>
<i>They fake the pitch near side,</i>

51:17.742 --> 51:19.135
<i>throw it down the middle,
wide open receiver</i>

51:19.159 --> 51:21.304
<i>- caught at the 40.</i>
- [Buddy] Get it down! Get it down!

51:21.328 --> 51:22.412
Jeez!

51:22.496 --> 51:24.289
[Crowder] <i>Touchdown, D.J. Montgomery!</i>

51:24.373 --> 51:26.751
[Winfield] <i>Well,</i>
<i>it's a rushing offense by design,</i>

51:26.834 --> 51:29.670
<i>but the thing is,
when you get worried about the run...</i>

51:29.754 --> 51:31.715
- [Buddy] That's horse crap!
<i>- It leaves guys open</i>

51:31.756 --> 51:33.090
<i>in the middle of the field.</i>

51:33.173 --> 51:36.468
Hey, let's go! We gotta stop that shit.
Get on the sidelines.

51:36.551 --> 51:39.805
[Winfield] <i>So far, defense only</i>
<i>a vague rumor here in Goodman.</i>

51:39.889 --> 51:41.783
- [Buddy] Hey!
- [Ed Holly] It's not gonna happen again.

51:41.807 --> 51:43.201
- Let's go. We understand this.
- [Buddy] Hey...

51:43.225 --> 51:45.686
I told you, "Discipline, discipline."

51:45.770 --> 51:47.450
[Crowder] <i>Both teams with a lot of offense</i>

51:47.521 --> 51:50.024
<i>as EMCC is gonna go three-wide here
to the near side.</i>

51:50.107 --> 51:51.167
[player] West, west motion.

51:51.191 --> 51:52.878
[Crowder] <i>Johnson's gonna be</i>
<i>in the shotgun.</i>

51:52.902 --> 51:54.630
<i>Here's a fade pattern
near side looking for Willis.</i>

51:54.654 --> 51:56.334
<i>Willis is gonna catch it
over his shoulder.</i>

51:56.405 --> 51:57.990
<i>Touchdown, EMCC!</i>

51:58.073 --> 51:59.366
[Ed Holly] Now, let's go!

51:59.449 --> 52:01.803
[Winfield] <i>That looked like</i>
<i>a throw you make in your backyard.</i>

52:01.827 --> 52:04.204
- [Trickett] Attaboy, attaboy!
- [Ed Holly] Let's go!

52:04.288 --> 52:06.089
[Crowder] <i>Twenty-six yard</i>
<i>touchdown receptions</i>

52:06.123 --> 52:08.333
<i>and EMCC has jumped back out on top.</i>

52:08.417 --> 52:10.127
<i>Let's see
what that defensive front can do.</i>

52:10.210 --> 52:11.796
[Winfield] <i>Do we have to say it again?</i>

52:11.879 --> 52:14.173
<i>Let's play assignment football
here on defense.</i>

52:14.256 --> 52:15.483
[Crowder] <i>They'll hand it off</i>
<i>to that D-back,</i>

52:15.507 --> 52:16.550
<i>he's gonna go up the gut.</i>

52:16.633 --> 52:18.945
<i>- At the 5, dives to the goal line.</i>
- [stadium announcer] <i>Touchdown!</i>

52:18.969 --> 52:20.429
- [coach] Come on.
- [Ed Holly] Fuck!

52:20.512 --> 52:21.847
What the fuck?

52:21.931 --> 52:23.199
[stadium announcer 2]
<i>Sixteen-yard touchdown run.</i>

52:23.223 --> 52:26.185
[Crowder] <i>EMCC is going to give up</i>
<i>the touchdown.</i>

52:26.268 --> 52:28.562
<i>Both teams have scored
on both possessions.</i>

52:28.645 --> 52:31.708
[Winfield] <i>Glen, it's got the feel of</i>
<i>an old Mountain West game here right now.</i>

52:31.732 --> 52:34.151
[Ed Holly] They runnin' through us
like shit through a goose.

52:34.234 --> 52:38.072
[Winfield] <i>This one's gonna be 62-61,</i>
<i>if we're not careful.</i>

52:38.155 --> 52:40.490
- They're bombin' that bitch on our ass.
- [chuckles]

52:40.574 --> 52:43.493
We, God damn,
out there lookin' like some bums tonight.

52:44.036 --> 52:45.329
Shit's crazy.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.664
Then they out there thinkin'
they fire as a motherfucker.

52:47.748 --> 52:49.750
[Buddy] Hey! Now go!
I'm telling you now, damn it!

52:49.834 --> 52:50.960
They'd better play.

52:51.043 --> 52:52.586
[Ed Holly] We have to do something.

52:52.669 --> 52:54.296
Hey, linebackers! Right here!

52:54.379 --> 52:56.173
So the end, so who's blocking the end,

52:56.256 --> 52:57.296
if he comes and blocks us?

52:57.341 --> 53:00.094
The end is squeezing. I guess,
he's squeezing too hard, Coach.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.304
All right, let's tell him
not to squeeze that hard.

53:02.387 --> 53:03.388
Fuck, I don't know.

53:03.472 --> 53:05.725
- Get down! Get down!
- [De'Andre] Thirty-three!

53:05.808 --> 53:08.477
[Crowder] <i>EMCC looking to go ahead</i>
<i>by a touchdown.</i>

53:08.560 --> 53:11.731
<i>Johnson takes it left side, gonna dive
for the goal line. Touchdown, EMCC!</i>

53:11.814 --> 53:16.193
<i>And Johnson has put EMCC up
by a touchdown. It is 21-14.</i>

53:16.861 --> 53:18.112
[Winfield] <i>De'Andre Johnson</i>

53:18.195 --> 53:21.824
<i>looking really, really good
here in this first quarter.</i>

53:21.907 --> 53:24.118
[Ed Holly] Next play.
Next play! Next play!

53:24.201 --> 53:26.221
[De'Andre] We've been through this.
We'll get around it.

53:26.245 --> 53:28.748
Another shootout. Another shootout, Jay.

53:28.831 --> 53:30.457
- [Buddy] Ed...
- You're right.

53:30.540 --> 53:32.877
- [stammers] I can't do this, man.
- You're right.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.000
Hey, listen. Listen to me.

53:34.044 --> 53:35.355
[stadium announcer 2]
<i>Twenty-seven, first and ten.</i>

53:35.379 --> 53:38.507
Listen to me. When we... Listen to me.
Don't get blocked on the edge.

53:38.590 --> 53:40.634
- Let's go.
- [player] Sir, we playing...

53:40.717 --> 53:42.677
[Ed Holly]
Just get the fucking signal, 404.

53:42.762 --> 53:44.388
Jesus Christ!

53:44.471 --> 53:46.974
[Winfield] <i>The last team</i>
<i>with the ball to score wins the game.</i>

53:47.057 --> 53:48.642
<i>At least that's how it's setting up.</i>

53:48.725 --> 53:51.103
[Crowder] <i>Here's the snap by Bryant.</i>
<i>He's back to pass.</i>

53:51.186 --> 53:54.148
<i>Rolls to his right, fires it back corner,
end zone, right side. Caught.</i>

53:54.231 --> 53:56.441
<i>And that's gonna be
another Holmes touchdown.</i>

53:56.525 --> 53:58.193
For crying out loud!

53:58.277 --> 54:00.695
How the fuck, dude?
Oh, my fucking God.

54:00.780 --> 54:03.908
Tim? What are you doing? God damn!

54:05.242 --> 54:11.081
What are you doing?
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, come here.

54:11.165 --> 54:12.499
[Ed Holly] We got it. We got it.

54:12.582 --> 54:14.835
[Buddy] Will you quit making
their ass look silly as shit

54:14.919 --> 54:17.922
and find something that fucking works?
You understand?

54:18.005 --> 54:19.673
Making our ass look silly as shit.

54:19.756 --> 54:22.843
[Winfield] <i>Well, Buddy Stephens</i>
<i>out with his palms to the sky</i>

54:22.927 --> 54:24.887
<i>which means he wants</i>
<i>an explanation.</i> [chuckles]

54:25.637 --> 54:27.764
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

54:27.848 --> 54:29.516
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

54:29.599 --> 54:32.561
[clapping rapidly] Play your butt off.
Want it more than they do.

54:32.644 --> 54:34.980
Let's go! Play your butt off.

54:35.064 --> 54:38.818
[Winfield] <i>We have a tie football game.</i>
<i>28-28.</i>

54:38.901 --> 54:42.279
<i>Neither offense has left the field
without a touchdown.</i>

54:42.362 --> 54:44.114
[Crowder]
<i>Isaiah Wright out there, tailback.</i>

54:44.198 --> 54:47.576
<i>De'Andre Johnson is back out
of quarterback trip receivers left side.</i>

54:47.659 --> 54:49.179
<i>Gonna leave it in the belly of Wright.</i>

54:49.203 --> 54:50.662
<i>He's got a big lane inside the 20,</i>

54:50.745 --> 54:52.747
<i>and he's gonna get inside
the ten, five, touchdown!</i>

54:52.832 --> 54:56.460
<i>He goes untouched. Oh, goodness, 48 yards.</i>

54:56.543 --> 54:58.879
- [Trickett] Whoo! That boy fast.
- [coach] Go score! Yes!

54:58.963 --> 55:01.006
Whoo! That boy fast.

55:01.090 --> 55:04.593
[Crowder] <i>And it will be a 35-28 game</i>
<i>here at halftime.</i>

55:04.676 --> 55:07.679
[Winfield] <i>They need some adjustments</i>
<i>defensively in the second half.</i>

55:07.762 --> 55:09.849
[Buddy] Everybody in the back can hear.
Let's go.

55:09.932 --> 55:12.226
Excuse me. Excuse me.

55:15.062 --> 55:16.355
[player] Watch out!

55:25.155 --> 55:27.282
Here's the bottom line. Okay?

55:27.366 --> 55:29.910
We got some front-running
sumbitches in here now.

55:30.785 --> 55:35.124
You either better goddamn get up off
your ass and let's go or let's get out.

55:35.749 --> 55:40.129
Defense, there's no reason
they run and dive for three yards

55:40.212 --> 55:43.507
with guys we wouldn't sign
as damn practice players.

55:44.341 --> 55:47.094
You better pull something
out of your rear end in the second half

55:47.177 --> 55:49.513
and make a stop on that first series

55:49.596 --> 55:51.306
and do what you're supposed to do.

55:51.390 --> 55:53.017
Or I swear to God...

55:53.725 --> 55:56.311
you will be running
till you can't see straight.

55:56.395 --> 55:59.273
I promise you, I promise you...

55:59.899 --> 56:01.816
we will have a hell of a weekend.

56:02.692 --> 56:04.569
You think I'm joking, try me!

56:05.862 --> 56:08.991
[Ed Holly] So far, we haven't held up
the defensive bargain in this game.

56:09.074 --> 56:12.369
And we know it, you know it and I know it.
And I love coaching you guys.

56:12.452 --> 56:15.289
I love it,
but if I'm gonna continue to be here,

56:15.372 --> 56:16.873
you gotta help me out now.

56:16.957 --> 56:19.293
We need to turn this tide around.

56:19.376 --> 56:22.462
[Winfield] <i>Buddy Stephens. He had</i>
<i>a problem with their assignment defense</i>

56:22.546 --> 56:24.881
<i>but we're gonna see
what they were able to get fixed.</i>

56:24.965 --> 56:27.134
<i>You really wanna get a stop
out of the dressing room.</i>

56:27.217 --> 56:29.511
<i>Or if not,
you got a tie ballgame all over again.</i>

56:29.594 --> 56:31.156
- [Ed Holly] Get outside.
- [Buddy] Outside! Go!

56:31.180 --> 56:32.615
[Crowder] <i>There's the pitch on the outside</i>

56:32.639 --> 56:36.351
<i>and getting out across the 40, 45,
and into EMCC territory.</i>

56:36.435 --> 56:38.770
<i>And they can't tackle him
but it seemed like he was getting</i>

56:38.853 --> 56:40.772
<i>a white shirt escort at times.</i>

56:40.855 --> 56:42.983
<i>They were around him
but just couldn't get him down.</i>

56:43.067 --> 56:44.710
<i>Await the snap.
He's gonna take it, toss it,</i>

56:44.734 --> 56:47.237
<i>uh, to the left side
and going in untouched</i>

56:47.321 --> 56:51.116
<i>as he walks to the goal line.
And Holmes has closed the gap.</i>

56:51.200 --> 56:53.953
[Winfield] <i>You know, sometimes,</i>
<i>I listen to Coach Buddy Stephens</i>

56:54.036 --> 56:56.246
<i>and I think, "That's a little much.
That's harsh."</i>

56:56.330 --> 56:58.415
<i>But, boy, EMCC probably needed it.</i>

56:58.498 --> 57:01.376
- [Wood] Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- [player shouting indistinctly]

57:01.460 --> 57:03.253
[Ed Holly] Physically dominate him.
Let's go.

57:03.337 --> 57:05.106
[Crowder] <i>Play action.</i>
<i>Firing it over the middle,</i>

57:05.130 --> 57:08.050
<i>has a man wide open.
Caught! Goal-line touchdown!</i>

57:08.133 --> 57:10.094
<i>- EMCC, Calvin Keys.</i>
- [cheering]

57:10.177 --> 57:14.098
- Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
- Yeah! There we go!

57:14.181 --> 57:17.184
Love that. Love that. I fucking love it!

57:17.267 --> 57:19.311
[Wood] Hey! How you like that?
How do you like that?

57:19.394 --> 57:21.081
- [De'Andre] I like that!
- [Williams] Come on.

57:21.105 --> 57:22.106
Don't fall asleep!

57:22.189 --> 57:23.917
[Crowder] <i>Dobbs will take the snap.</i>
<i>Leave it with his, uh,</i>

57:23.941 --> 57:25.421
<i>tailback who's gonna go
up the middle,</i>

57:25.484 --> 57:27.236
<i>and he is going to go untouched.</i>

57:27.319 --> 57:29.904
<i>30, 25, 10-yard line, 5-yard line.</i>

57:29.989 --> 57:31.906
<i>And that's gonna be
another Holmes touchdown.</i>

57:31.991 --> 57:34.243
<i>Holmes is gonna tie this one up
with a PAT.</i>

57:34.326 --> 57:37.955
- Aw, shit!
- Come on, people! Play the damn hole!

57:38.038 --> 57:40.040
- [Buddy] Hey. God damn it.
- [Ed Holly yells]

57:40.124 --> 57:42.376
[Crowder] <i>That big play is hurting EMCC.</i>

57:42.459 --> 57:44.503
Hey. Get this shit fixed!

57:44.586 --> 57:46.272
I got to get back.
I got to get outta the way.

57:46.296 --> 57:49.174
Or else I'm gonna say something
to Ed that's crazy.

57:49.257 --> 57:53.929
Go find something else to film right now.
I'm getting kinda fed up with this shit.

57:55.555 --> 57:57.755
[Crowder] <i>They kick it.</i>
<i>Retaken by the Lions at the ten.</i>

57:57.807 --> 58:01.561
<i>Number four, Isaiah Wright,
20, 25 and a big lane</i>

58:01.645 --> 58:03.855

[Winfield] <i>You have to be thinking,</i>
