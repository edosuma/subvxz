00:08.509 --> 00:09.343
I haven't seen that
in a while.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.079

an Innocence Project case.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.346
- He killed my girl!

00:12.380 --> 00:14.248
- But I believe that
Leonard Bailey is innocent,

00:14.282 --> 00:16.117
and I'm going to make sure
that he gets the fair trial

00:16.149 --> 00:17.318
that he never had.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.187
- By tracking down
some junkie witness?

00:19.220 --> 00:20.621
- Maria Gomez never had
a chance to be heard.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.656
- Leonard Bailey's
alibi witness is dead.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.392
That doesn't mean
her testimony is.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.294
- You want me to testify
to what she told me?

00:26.327 --> 00:29.663
- My protégé took the liberty of
drawing up a sword affidavit.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.266
You can either sign it
or you can lie under oath

00:32.299 --> 00:33.401
that this isn't true.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.270
- Are you saying that
this case needs to be re-opened

00:36.304 --> 00:39.173
based on Leonard Bailey having
inadequate representation?

00:39.207 --> 00:40.208
- It sure as hell
is our plan now.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.542
- You set me up.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.610
I'm gonna make sure
the world knows it.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.278
- You can tell the world
anything you want, William.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.646
But you got no proof.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.249
Either way, I suggest
you sign this deal.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.550
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.252
I'm coming home.

are joining us?

01:13.441 --> 01:14.708
- Wasn't which Scotch
you'd want,

01:14.742 --> 01:16.677
so I went ahead
and ordered them all.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.312
- What if I'm in the mood
for a beer?

01:18.346 --> 01:19.380
- You just got out of prison.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.115
You're not in the mood
for a beer.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.583
- Yeah, you're right.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.288
- Welcome home.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.325
- Oh, damn that tastes good.

01:31.359 --> 01:34.162
- That's not even the best thing
I have for ya.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.502
- It's an offer letter.
- Take a look at the number.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.304
- This is the same money
I made as a junior partner.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.605
- Because you are
a junior partner.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.208
The best there is.
And we need you.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.277
- I just got out of prison.
I'm not trying to go back.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.711
- You're not going back,
because even though

01:50.744 --> 01:52.213
you'll be acting
as a lawyer,

01:52.246 --> 01:54.548
your title's gonna be
"consultant."

01:56.384 --> 02:00.721
- Look, Harvey, I appreciate
the gesture, but...

02:00.754 --> 02:02.656
everyone left that firm
because of me.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.292
I'm not gonna do that
to you again.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.759
- Mike--
- No, listen to me.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.661
You've done enough, you don't
have to do this for me.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.631
- I'm not doing this for you.
I'm doing it for me.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.401
I miss working with you.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.436
- I miss working
with you, too.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.571
- Then do me a favor:
just think about it.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.174
If the answer's still no
in a few days,

02:20.208 --> 02:21.642
I won't bring it up again.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.652
- We've been over this,
Virginia.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.555
I do my part.
- That's the problem, Alan.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.690
You think your part is just
getting a paycheck.

02:36.724 --> 02:37.691

This family lives like
no other family we know.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.532
Jessica, honey--
- What's going on?

02:44.565 --> 02:45.966

having an argument.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.668
It'll be okay.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.670
- You don't need to sugarcoat
things for her, Alan.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.305
And you'd know this
if you were ever here

02:51.339 --> 02:53.441
instead of out doing
whatever it is you're doing.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.643
- What I'm out doing is saving
lives, and you know it.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.578
- Well, maybe if you worked
as hard on our relationship

I'd love to chit chat,
but I've got trial in an hour,

03:32.780 --> 03:34.815
so unless it's urgent...

03:34.848 --> 03:37.351
- I just wanted to thank you.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.519
For Mike.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.020
- You don't have to
thank me for that.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.489
I wanted him out
as much as you did.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.324
- I know, but you didn't
have to back me

03:43.357 --> 03:45.459
when it came to Sutter,
and you did.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.761

the same for me.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.364
And now that he is out,

03:50.398 --> 03:53.267
let's get back to the business
of keeping this firm alive.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.603
- If I were you, I would start
by locking up Jim Reynolds.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.037
- Excuse me?
- What're you talking about?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.039
- I'm talking about the fact
that your first client

03:59.072 --> 04:01.275
is shopping for another attorney
behind your back.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.676
- Don't tell me,
you're about to pounce.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.512
- I'm not trying to poach
your client, Harvey.

04:04.545 --> 04:05.779
But if you can't keep him,
I will.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.648
- I appreciate you
coming down here, Robert,

04:07.681 --> 04:09.650
but it's not exactly your style
to give the competition

04:09.683 --> 04:11.652
a heads-up.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.654
- When I was kid,
the Yankees and the Red Sox

04:13.687 --> 04:15.823
were the best
damn rivalry ever.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.491
- What's your point?

04:17.524 --> 04:19.627
- My point is, after Bucky Dent
hit that beautiful

04:19.660 --> 04:22.296
home run in '78,
the Sox fell off a cliff.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.064
It wasn't any fun anymore.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.066
- You're saying you don't want
to dominate the division?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.336
- I'm saying
you fell off a cliff.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.504
And if you want a chance
to get back in the game...

04:30.538 --> 04:31.672
- We better keep Jim Reynolds.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.374
- And you better
get on it right now.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.642
Because I may not be
looking to pounce,

04:34.675 --> 04:37.478
but every firm in this city is.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.882
- Damn it.

04:41.915 --> 04:45.719
The last thing we need is
Jim Reynolds leaving right now.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.788
- What happened to calling,
like he did last time,

04:47.821 --> 04:49.523
instead of going
behind our backs?

04:49.557 --> 04:50.791
- I'll tell you what happened.
He's getting pressure

04:50.824 --> 04:52.560
from his board
like he said he would.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.794
- And you said we'd
get back on our feet

04:53.827 --> 04:55.496
by the end of the month
and we did.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.564
- And that's exactly what
you're gonna tell them.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.698
- What do you mean me?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.900
- Did you not hear what I just
told you five minutes ago?

04:59.933 --> 05:02.770
I've got trial in an hour.
- I don't care.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.938
You've been his lead attorney
since they got here.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.874
If you don't go over yourself,
we're gonna lose him.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.576
- Then take Louis with you.
- Jessica--

05:08.609 --> 05:11.712
- Harvey, all you have to do
is open up our books

05:11.745 --> 05:13.914
and show them we're standing
on solid ground.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.884
- Or you can make this the
priority and get a continuance.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.852
- It's a death row appeal,
Harvey.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.489
How's it gonna look if I start
a trial saying that my business

05:21.522 --> 05:23.357
is more important
than a man's life?

05:23.391 --> 05:24.525
- You don't say that.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.559
You come up with
some other reason.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.927
- Whatever reason
I come up with,

05:26.960 --> 05:28.929
that prosecutor's gonna make it
look like I don't care.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.498
And I'm not taking that risk.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.565
- Jessica--
- No, enough.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.767
You want to thank me
for having your back with Mike,

05:33.801 --> 05:34.735
then take care of this.

What do you need her for?

06:19.913 --> 06:21.048

I need Louis,

06:21.081 --> 06:22.182
and I don't know where he is.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.951
- Well, why didn't you
start with that?

06:23.984 --> 06:26.153
He had an emergency meeting with
a client and he ran out of here.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.188
- When?
- Half an hour ago.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.990
I saw him at the elevators

I need to talk to him.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.101
Harvey, I was there the night
he put Jessica on notice.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.203
If he's leaving, then you don't
have time to wait for Louis.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.105

work with Reynolds,

06:45.138 --> 06:46.874
I'm gonna need Louis

It's a subpoena.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.185

You have what you need.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.187

you wouldn't have to testify

07:00.220 --> 07:01.188
that Bailey had an alibi?

07:01.221 --> 07:03.023

you were going to

07:03.056 --> 07:04.758
paint me as incompetent.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.894

to do with your revenue stream.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.106

this about?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.742

that you tanked

William Sutter's case.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.011

- Well, it doesn't matter
what you believe, Jim.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.750
Because the board
believes it.

you're the board.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.657

rubbing off on me.

- The only thing that's
rubbing off on you, Donald,

08:11.792 --> 08:14.027
is a load of bullshit
from William Sutter.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.897

in prison with his son-in-law,

your guy gets out.

You may call that bullshit,
but his story adds up to me.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.304
And this company
can't have an attorney

08:24.337 --> 08:26.974
who's willing to turn on
his own client.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.777
*

08:29.810 --> 08:30.878
- You see what
I'm dealing with?

08:30.911 --> 08:33.212
I only took those meetings
because I'm being pressured

08:33.246 --> 08:34.782
to take those meetings.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.249
- I get it.
That asshole wants your job.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.951
- He doesn't just want it.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.886
If I don't let you go,
he's gonna get it.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.022
And the one thing that might've
changed that was Jessica

08:42.054 --> 08:44.692
coming in here and showing him
how important we are to her.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.126
- You are important to her,
Jim.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.828
But Jessica's
in trial right now.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.262
- Then you should've sent
Louis Litt,

08:49.296 --> 08:50.864
because the last thing
that asshole needed to see

08:50.898 --> 08:52.866
when he walked in here was you.

08:52.900 --> 08:59.239
*

09:01.241 --> 09:03.243
- Your Honor, permission to
treat the witness as hostile.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.912
- On what grounds?

09:04.945 --> 09:06.814
The witness hasn't even
said anything yet.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.248
- On the grounds that
five minutes ago,

09:08.281 --> 09:10.818
she told me she'd sooner deny
Leonard Bailey

09:10.851 --> 09:14.187
a new trial than to risk
looking incompetent.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.956
- Is this true?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.090
- Yes.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.225
- Then permission granted.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.960
- Ms. Casey,

09:19.993 --> 09:21.995
when you were Leonard Bailey's
public defender,

09:22.029 --> 09:24.898
did he tell you that
at the time of the murders,

09:24.932 --> 09:26.967
he was in the apartment of
a woman named Maria Gomez?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.368
- Yes.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.771
- Which means he not only
had an alibi,

09:30.804 --> 09:32.139
he had a witness that could
testify to it.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.941
Is that correct?
- Yes.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.343
- Then why in God's name
didn't that witness

09:36.376 --> 09:37.377
ever take the stand?

09:37.410 --> 09:40.080
- Because she left town
without telling anyone

09:40.113 --> 09:41.949
right before the trial started.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.250
- Did you try to locate her?
- Yes, I did.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.218
- How hard did you look?
- I did my best.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.387
- The truth is, you didn't
look for her at all, did you?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.355
- That's not true.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.123
I did everything
I could to try to find her.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.124
- But you didn't.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.325
And if you had,

09:52.359 --> 09:54.127
there would have been
an alibi witness

09:54.161 --> 09:55.295
that would've told the jury that
he couldn't have possibly

09:55.328 --> 09:57.030
have committed those murders.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.032
- That witness was a drug addict
with a prior conviction,

09:59.066 --> 10:01.001
and she would have been
eviscerated on the stand.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.871
- Then why did you
try to find her at all?

10:03.904 --> 10:06.006
*

10:06.039 --> 10:08.141
Let me suggest an answer.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.911
You did try to find her,
because you knew if you did,

10:10.944 --> 10:12.913
Leonard Bailey would be
found innocent.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.381
But you dropped the ball.

10:14.414 --> 10:18.819
Leonard Bailey
went to death row.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.954
And you'd rather
let him stay there

10:20.988 --> 10:22.089
than to admit the truth.

10:22.122 --> 10:27.828
*

10:27.861 --> 10:29.396
- Ms. Casey, in your estimation,

10:29.429 --> 10:31.264
was Leonard Bailey innocent?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.801
- Objection, Your Honor,
calls for a conclusion.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.302
- Your Honor, they opened
the door to this

10:35.335 --> 10:37.037
when they put her on the stand,

10:37.070 --> 10:41.374
and no one is more qualified to
answer than his own attorney.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.944
- I'll allow it.
Ms. Casey?

10:43.977 --> 10:47.147
- I thought Leonard Bailey
was guilty.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.882
And I still do.

10:48.916 --> 10:52.920
*

10:52.953 --> 10:54.988
- Louis, the next time you have
an emergency meeting,

10:55.022 --> 10:56.023
you better clear it with me.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.058
- I'll keep that in mind
for the future, Harvey.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.060
But the reason I had
an emergency meeting was you.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.428
- What the hell
are you talking about?

11:01.461 --> 11:03.964
- Jensen Analytics heard a rumor
you tanked Sutter's case

11:03.997 --> 11:05.232
and they're threatening
to walk.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.433
- Shit.
What'd you tell them?

11:06.466 --> 11:08.068
- What do you think
I told them?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.136
I told them William Sutter's
a lying son of a bitch

11:09.169 --> 11:10.370
who'll do or say anything
to get what he wants.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.972
- What did they say?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.106
- They said if Jessica's
oldest client's leaving,

11:13.140 --> 11:14.107
why should they stay?

11:14.141 --> 11:16.076
- Goddamn it.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.411
- Harvey, if they think that,
then it's just a matter of time

11:18.445 --> 11:20.480
until all our clients
think that.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.482
- Which means we need to get
Jim Reynolds to stay.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.117
- What're we gonna
tell Jessica?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.086
- We're gonna tell her if
she doesn't do something

11:26.119 --> 11:27.287
about Reynolds soon,
she's not gonna have a firm

11:27.320 --> 11:28.922
to come back to.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.024
*

11:42.836 --> 11:44.204
- Hey..

11:44.237 --> 11:46.907
- Hey.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.142
- Rachel, listen to me,
it went as well as it could've.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.911
You don't have to
look so worried.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.213
- How can I not look worried?

11:53.246 --> 11:56.083
Mike, that woman said that
she thought he was guilty

11:56.116 --> 11:57.885
and the prosecutor
got it on record.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.987
- And Jessica got it on record
that she was incompetent

12:00.020 --> 12:00.854
before he did that.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.155
The jury heard it.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.024
- Yeah, but you saw the jury
as well as I did.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.893
They're not convinced.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.196
- Put Leonard on the stand.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.864
- Mike, we haven't
prepped him yet.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.265
He's not ready.
- Rachel, just listen to me.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.201
When I was on trial,
I didn't just give the jury

12:14.234 --> 12:17.170
a reason to let me go.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.906
- You gave them a reason
to want to let you go.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.808
- Exactly, and it turns out,
they were going to.

12:20.841 --> 12:21.741
And I was guilty.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.010
What do you think they're gonna
do for a man

12:23.043 --> 12:24.845
who's actually innocent?

12:24.878 --> 12:27.848
[somber music]

12:27.881 --> 12:32.052
*

12:32.085 --> 12:33.821
- What are you doing here?

12:33.854 --> 12:35.288
- I needed to see you.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.258
- Me too.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.061
Had a rough day.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.331
Got some bad news.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.899
You're a sight
for sore eyes.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.801
- Louis...

12:47.835 --> 12:48.735
- What's wrong?

12:48.768 --> 12:51.571
- I had a doctor's appointment
this morning.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.273
- Well, whatever it is,
we can deal with it together.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.875
Modern medicine is a wonder.

12:54.908 --> 12:55.876
There's almost nothing
that they can't--

12:55.909 --> 12:57.310
- I'm pregnant.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.182
- Oh, my God.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.951
I mean, I knew the Litt sperm
were powerful,

13:03.984 --> 13:04.852
but this has to be
some kind of record.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.820
- Louis.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.858
- Don't tell me.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.026
It's his.
- Louis, I'm so sorry.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.294
I didn't mean for this
to happen.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.329
I'm usually so careful.
- I don't care.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.898
- Louis, I don't think
you know what you're saying.

13:17.931 --> 13:18.866
- No, I know exactly
what I'm saying.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.333
I love you.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.335
And if being with you means
raising another man's child,

13:22.369 --> 13:24.071
then I'll raise
another man's child.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.173
- You say that now,
but it hasn't sunk in yet.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.841
- That's not true.

13:27.875 --> 13:28.876
I'm gonna say
the same thing tomorrow

13:28.909 --> 13:30.310
and the day after that
and the day after that.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.611
- Then say it to me then.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.613
But it has been a long day
for both of us.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.349
And I think we should
both just get some sleep.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.251
- Tara, please
come home with me.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.953
- Good night, Louis.

13:39.987 --> 13:46.426
*

13:49.229 --> 13:51.131
- Jessica, we have a problem.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.100
- Not what I want to hear
on my way out, Harvey.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.467
- Then you're not gonna want to
hear that you need to be at

13:54.501 --> 13:56.403
Jim Reynolds' next
board meeting.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.238
- That doesn't sound like
you put out the fire.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.040
- What I couldn't put out
were the rumors

14:00.073 --> 14:01.909
that we threw Sutter's case
to get Mike out.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.410
- Are you kidding me?
That's what this is about?

14:03.443 --> 14:05.212
- Jessica, it's not Jim.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.413
He's loyal
and always has been.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.248
- Don't tell me.
It's Donald Mannis

14:08.281 --> 14:09.416
using this shit
as a power play.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.218
- Exactly.
And I walked right into it,

14:11.251 --> 14:13.220
because I showed up
without you.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.122
- Son of a bitch.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.656
- Jessica,
the only thing we can do

14:16.689 --> 14:17.925
is hold onto Reynolds

14:17.958 --> 14:18.959
and hope the others
fall in line.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.260
- All right, set up a meeting
for Tuesday morning.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.029
The trial should
be over by then.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.431
But Harvey, it won't make
a bit of difference

14:24.464 --> 14:26.433
if Sutter's out there telling
the world we're the kind of

14:26.466 --> 14:28.969
lawyers that throw cases.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.670
You do what you have to--
you shut that man the hell up.

14:30.703 --> 14:37.344
*

14:40.981 --> 14:42.115
- Who's he?

14:42.149 --> 14:43.383
- Leonard,
this is my fiancГ©, Mike.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.154
He used to work at the firm
and he has an idea.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.389
Let Leonard tell his story.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.991
- That's risky.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.325
We're giving them
the chance to paint him

14:52.359 --> 14:53.460
as a drug user
and a criminal.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.328
- They're already doing that.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.397
And they're not gonna stop.

14:57.430 --> 15:01.201
- Leonard, this is as much
your call as it is ours.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.469
What do you want to do?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.337
- I wanted to say my piece
last time,

15:04.371 --> 15:07.941
but that lady didn't let me,
so please,

15:07.975 --> 15:10.410
put me on that stand and give me
a chance to say it now.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.413
- Okay.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.548
- Is the defense ready to call
their next witness?

15:15.582 --> 15:18.085
- The defense calls
Leonard Bailey, Your Honor.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.153
We'd also like to request
that Ms. Zane

15:20.187 --> 15:21.955
be permitted to
question the witness.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.390
- Objection,
Ms. Zane is a law student,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.425
not an admitted member
of the bar.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.559
- She's also been
a practicing paralegal

15:26.593 --> 15:28.295
for the last eight years.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.163
- I don't care if she was the
President of the United States.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.966
She's not a lawyer and they're
laying grounds for a mistrial.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.235
- Your Honor, it's obvious
Mr. Bailey's first attorney

15:35.268 --> 15:37.037
didn't care about him at all.

15:37.070 --> 15:40.440
But Ms. Zane fought to have
this case taken on,

15:40.473 --> 15:42.175
and she's the reason
we're even here today.

15:42.209 --> 15:45.145
Which is why Mr. Bailey is
simply asking

15:45.178 --> 15:46.980
that she be with him now.

15:47.014 --> 15:50.317
So unless the prosecution
is so unsure of its case

15:50.350 --> 15:53.086
that he can't handle
a law student,

15:53.120 --> 15:56.356
we ask that she be allowed
to question the witness.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.126
- Prosecution withdraws
its objection.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.460
- Then your request is granted.

16:00.493 --> 16:07.334
*

16:11.538 --> 16:12.505
[knocks]

16:16.443 --> 16:17.344
- Harvey.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.379
I thought I might
get a visit from you.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.314
- And I thought I told you
to keep your mouth shut.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.516
- Well, I stopped taking advice
from you when you sold me out.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.019
Now get the hell off my property
before I call the police.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.088
- There's only one problem
with that, William.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.422
This isn't
your property anymore.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.623
- What the hell
are you talking about?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.392
- At 8:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning,

16:32.425 --> 16:33.626
it's being seized
by the government.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.128
- Bullshit.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.363
This is a Homestead state.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.131
- Turns out,
I did a little checking,

16:38.165 --> 16:40.500
and you closed on this house
before you sold the last one,

16:40.533 --> 16:43.270
which means they can take it
and they're going to.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.337
- What do you want?

16:44.371 --> 16:46.139
- You're gonna repair
my reputation.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.141
And you're gonna start by
calling every member

16:48.175 --> 16:50.577
of Jim Reynolds' board
and telling them that

16:50.610 --> 16:52.545
you spread those rumors about me
because you're a lying

16:52.579 --> 16:54.147
son of a bitch.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.648
- And what makes you think
they'll believe me?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.417
- Because you're a hell of
a salesman, William,

16:57.450 --> 16:59.152
when you're motivated,
and I'm pretty sure that when

16:59.186 --> 17:00.587
you get out of prison,
you're gonna be motivated

17:00.620 --> 17:02.589
not to live on the street.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.526
*

17:06.559 --> 17:10.130
- I was getting high
with my friend Maria.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.098
I won't deny that.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.634
But all I did to those kids
was try and help them.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.935
- Help them how?

17:15.968 --> 17:19.839
- Me and Maria got hungry so we
went to get something to eat.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.242
That's when we saw them.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.412
Lying there on the sidewalk...

17:25.444 --> 17:27.614
with blood all over 'em.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.683
Maria, she, uh...
she freaked out,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.552
But I wasn't thinking,
so I just ran up.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.187
I mean, they were kids,
you know?

17:34.221 --> 17:35.388
They--they were in trouble.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.256
- So then what happened?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.658
- Well, I yelled
for Maria to get help.

17:38.691 --> 17:42.262
But the boy...

17:42.295 --> 17:44.564
he was already gone.

17:44.597 --> 17:49.136
And the girl, she just kept
asking for help, over and over.

17:50.737 --> 17:54.374
I stayed with her.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.177
And then the police came.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.311
And the next thing you know,

17:58.345 --> 18:01.248
I was being charged
with murder.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.216
- Leonard...

18:03.250 --> 18:06.686
you were married before
you went to prison, weren't you?

18:06.719 --> 18:11.424
- My wife, she left me
two years after I went away.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.193
She said she couldn't
handle it anymore.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.361
- And what about
your children?

18:14.394 --> 18:15.595
Do you still see them?

18:15.628 --> 18:18.565
- I haven't seen my son
in over ten years.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.734
And I hadn't seen Maya
until you found her

18:21.768 --> 18:25.505
and told her I was innocent
and you were going to prove it.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.507
That's her right there.

18:27.540 --> 18:32.145
*

18:32.179 --> 18:34.314
- Leonard, is there something
that you would

18:34.347 --> 18:36.616
like to say to her?

18:36.649 --> 18:40.553
- I lost 12 years
for a crime I didn't commit.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.455
*

18:42.489 --> 18:45.192
But I won't regret any of it

18:45.225 --> 18:47.227
if it ends up being the thing

18:47.260 --> 18:50.230
that got me clean
and reunited with you.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.232
*

18:52.265 --> 18:54.701
Because if I died

18:54.734 --> 18:56.669
with you believing
your father did this...

18:56.703 --> 18:58.438
- She doesn't think that.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.641
She knows that you didn't
hurt those kids.

19:01.674 --> 19:05.678
*

19:05.712 --> 19:07.680
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.416
*

19:09.449 --> 19:10.750
- Your Honor,
we reserve the right

19:10.783 --> 19:12.752
to cross examine
the defendant.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.955
But for now, since he's claiming
he knows what it feels like

19:15.988 --> 19:18.658
to be an aggrieved father,
I'd like to call Victor Forrest

19:18.691 --> 19:19.759
to the stand.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.162
*

19:31.338 --> 19:33.406
I know how difficult
it must be for you.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.942
Would you mind telling us a
little bit about your daughter?

19:35.975 --> 19:37.544
- What can I say?

19:37.577 --> 19:41.348
Kim was our everything--
she was sweet, kind.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.383
Incredible sense of humor.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.851
- She played soccer,
didn't she?

19:44.884 --> 19:48.621
- Used to watch her run up
and down the field.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.490
Never got tired,
she just kept running,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.659
big smile on her face.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.262
She had such
a beautiful smile.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.364
- It's obvious you loved her
very much.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.399
- I didn't just love her.
I tried to protect her.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.401
I warned her about boys.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.303
Drugs.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.472
And I said, "If you're ever
in trouble, you call me."

20:05.505 --> 20:07.840
And the thing that gets me is,

20:07.874 --> 20:09.309
she did call that night.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.844
Not to say she was in trouble.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.580
To say she was coming home.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.415
- But she never did
make it home.

20:15.448 --> 20:19.586
- No, and I don't care what some
junkie witness was gonna say.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.689
They found that animal standing
over my little girl's body.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.691
Her blood all over him.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.994
He took away my everything
in one night.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.397
And he did it for money
to buy more drugs.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.300
- And how do you feel about
the speech he gave to the jury?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.968
- He talked about getting
a second chance with his family.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.037
What about my family?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.006
Our lives were
ruined that night.

20:40.039 --> 20:43.343
My little girl never even
got a first chance.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.711
- No further questions,
Your Honor.

20:44.744 --> 20:49.716
*

20:49.749 --> 20:52.619
- Mr. Forrest...

20:52.652 --> 20:54.053
did you actually see
Leonard Bailey

20:54.086 --> 20:55.455
kill your daughter?

20:55.488 --> 20:57.424
- Of course I didn't,
but that doesn't mean--

20:57.457 --> 20:59.058
- No further questions,
Your Honor.

20:59.091 --> 21:06.299
*

21:09.502 --> 21:11.538
- Donna, can I talk to you
for a second?

21:11.571 --> 21:14.006
- Well, since you asked so
nicely, I'll even give you two.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.575
- I have some bad news
I have to give Louis,

21:15.608 --> 21:17.444
and since he and I are finally
in a good place...

21:17.477 --> 21:18.645
- You want to know how to
break it to him

21:18.678 --> 21:20.079
without blowing things up again.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.914
- Yeah.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.450
- How bad is it?

21:23.483 --> 21:25.752
- It's not good.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.954
- Then do what
you just did with me.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.323
Approach him with respect,
pull the Band-Aid off,

21:30.357 --> 21:31.624
and if you have that
same look on your face

21:31.658 --> 21:33.426
as you do right now,

21:33.460 --> 21:36.496
he'll send you on your way
with a handshake.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.097
- Thanks, Donna.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.700
- Stu?

21:40.733 --> 21:42.535
It was nice having you here.

21:42.569 --> 21:49.542
*

21:51.644 --> 21:53.613
- What?

21:53.646 --> 21:56.549
- You should've seen yourself
thunder away at Kendrick today.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.651
You were amazing.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.487
And if I were Dawson or Downey

22:00.520 --> 22:02.689
and I had to choose between you
and your father

22:02.722 --> 22:05.425
to represent me on this,

22:05.458 --> 22:08.395
I'd choose you any day of
the week and twice on Sunday.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.596
- What're you talking about?

22:09.629 --> 22:11.097
- I'm talking about
"A Few Good Men."

22:11.130 --> 22:13.400
- Mike, I don't have time
for movie quotes right now.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.134
- I'm not trying to quote
a movie, Rachel,

22:15.167 --> 22:16.703
I'm trying to tell you that
it doesn't matter

22:16.736 --> 22:18.004
what that girl's father said.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.406
You're still in this,

22:19.439 --> 22:21.741
and you were
great up there.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.044
- Wait a minute,
her father.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.981
- What about him?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.456
- He called Maria
a junkie witness.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.090
How would he even know
that she was a drug user?

22:38.124 --> 22:39.692
- What do you mean?
The same way I would know.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.761
Leonard and his public defender
said so on the stand.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.531
- No, but he used those exact
words when he came at me

22:44.564 --> 22:46.132
trying to get me
to drop this whole thing.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.667
- He came at you?
- It's fine, I handled it.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.537
But he did try to
intimidate me.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.572
- And a man who would
intimidate you might do

22:52.605 --> 22:54.040
the same thing
to Maria Gomez.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.708
- Yeah, but I don't think
he intimidated her.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.009
I think he did the opposite.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.110
- What're you saying?

22:58.144 --> 23:00.713
- I'm saying I think we need to
pay that man a visit.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.450
[dramatic music]

23:04.717 --> 23:05.818
- Louis, do you
have a minute?

23:05.852 --> 23:07.454
- Tell you the truth, Stu,
I kind of have

23:07.487 --> 23:08.721
a full plate right now,
so unless it's a matter

23:08.755 --> 23:10.723
of life and death,
I'd rather it wait.

23:10.757 --> 23:13.593
- This can't wait.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.061
We have to move out.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.062
- What do you mean,
"move out"?

23:16.095 --> 23:17.797
- We're relocating.

23:17.830 --> 23:21.200
I wanted to tell you in person
so there's no hard feelings.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.569
- Oh, bullshit,
you can't do this.

23:22.602 --> 23:23.736
- Louis, I don't
have a choice.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.204
Sutter went bankrupt
two days ago,

23:25.237 --> 23:26.439
and they owed us
under their contract.

23:26.473 --> 23:29.108
They're offering us their space
to cover their obligations

23:29.141 --> 23:30.743
and I have to say yes
by tomorrow.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.712
- You wouldn't even have
those obligations, Stu,

23:32.745 --> 23:33.880
if it weren't for us.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.515
- I know that,
but I can't tell my bosses

23:35.548 --> 23:36.883
I'm passing on a fortune
in free rent

23:36.916 --> 23:38.184
'cause you guys
did me a solid.

23:38.217 --> 23:38.985
- Well, then you tell them
you have a lease

23:39.018 --> 23:41.754
and I'm gonna
sue your goddamn ass.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.155
- Louis, there's a clause
in the lease that gives me

23:43.189 --> 23:46.493
a 30-day out
and you know it.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.527
- Stu, please.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.562
You cannot do this
to us now.

23:49.596 --> 23:52.164
Not tonight.
- I'm sorry, Louis.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.766
I hate to hang you out to dry
and if I could help you

23:53.800 --> 23:56.168
in another way, I would.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.837
But we can't
rent this space.

23:57.870 --> 24:04.477
*

24:05.712 --> 24:07.514
[glass shatters]

24:07.547 --> 24:14.521
*

24:19.158 --> 24:21.227
- I have nothing to say to you.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.129
- Please, Mr. Forrest,
you confronted me

24:23.162 --> 24:24.230
when I didn't
want to talk to you,

24:24.263 --> 24:26.599
and I gave you the respect
to hear what you had to say.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.535
- You can at least hear
what we have to say.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.503
- You got 60 seconds,
then I'm calling the police.

24:30.537 --> 24:31.704
- Go ahead,
but when they get here,

24:31.738 --> 24:33.806
we'll tell them all about how
you sent Maria Gomez away

24:33.840 --> 24:35.107
so that she couldn't testify.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.143
- That's insane.
- Is it?

24:37.176 --> 24:39.612
Because a woman who was never
in the court record

24:39.646 --> 24:42.715
as a drug user went to a rehab
facility she could never afford

24:42.749 --> 24:44.517
and you know enough about her
to call her a druggie

24:44.551 --> 24:45.785
to my face a month ago.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.219
- That's not proof of anything.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.722
- And that's not the answer
of an innocent man.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.858
Look, Mr. Forrest,

24:51.891 --> 24:53.626
I can't begin to understand

24:53.660 --> 24:56.128
what you've been through,
but right now, the wrong man

24:56.162 --> 24:58.197
is sitting on death row
because of what you did.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.867
- I didn't do shit.
- Please.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.570
Can't you imagine what this has
been like for Leonard Bailey,

25:03.603 --> 25:07.139
what his life has looked like
for the past past 12 years?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.208
- The only thing I want to
imagine is what my life's

25:09.241 --> 25:11.744
gonna be like after that man
takes his final breath.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.245
Your time is up.

25:13.279 --> 25:19.919
*

25:23.623 --> 25:25.658
- Louis, is everything okay?

25:25.692 --> 25:27.259
- What do you mean?

25:27.293 --> 25:29.328
- I mean, I saw
what happened with Stu.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.263
I know he's leaving,
but it's gonna be okay.

25:31.297 --> 25:32.965
Harvey's gonna fix things
with Jim Reynolds,

25:32.999 --> 25:33.966
we're gonna get
more clients--

25:34.000 --> 25:36.903
- Tara's pregnant.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.304
It's not mine.

25:38.337 --> 25:39.438
- What did you tell her?

25:39.471 --> 25:41.307
- I told her I'm going to stay
with her and support her

25:41.340 --> 25:43.843
every way I can,
because I'm in love with her.

25:43.876 --> 25:44.677
- And what did she say?

25:44.711 --> 25:46.012
- She said we need to
sleep on it

25:46.045 --> 25:47.747
because it hasn't sunk in
for me.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.215
- Then what were you
so upset about?

25:49.248 --> 25:50.282
- What if she's saying that
because she can't

25:50.316 --> 25:51.918
decided what she's gonna do?

25:51.951 --> 25:52.919
- Louis--
- How do I know

25:52.952 --> 25:53.986
she didn't wake up
this morning

25:54.020 --> 25:55.588
and decide to
run back to him?

25:55.622 --> 25:56.623
- That's not what's going on.

25:56.656 --> 25:59.258
This is a huge decision
and she wants to make sure

25:59.291 --> 26:00.226
that you're in it
for the long haul.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.228
- Donna, I would never
go back on my word.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.295
- That's not true
and you know it.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.598
You make impulsive decisions
and you go back on them

26:05.632 --> 26:06.599
all the time.

26:06.633 --> 26:07.634
- This is different.
- How?

26:07.667 --> 26:09.368
- Because it's a baby.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.738
I would never do that
to a baby.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.806
- I hear you,
but all I'm saying is,

26:13.840 --> 26:15.708
don't do something rash.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.310
Because this isn't something
you can change your mind about.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.781
*

26:21.814 --> 26:23.650
- You got to be kidding.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.652
You went to see the victim's
father without telling me?

26:25.685 --> 26:27.887
- Jessica, we didn't have time
and we had to know.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.822
- And like you taught Harvey
and Harvey taught me,

26:29.856 --> 26:31.791
it's better to ask forgiveness
than permission.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.359
- You're not asking
for either one.

26:33.392 --> 26:36.328
You're asking me to accuse the
man of obstruction of justice

26:36.362 --> 26:37.630
in open court.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.031
- Jessica, we looked
the man in the eye,

26:39.065 --> 26:40.933
and I'm telling you,
he did it.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.802
- I don't give a shit
if he did it or not.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.737
There's no way on the planet
we can prove it.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.806
- We don't have to prove it if
you can break him on the stand.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.074
- Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

26:48.107 --> 26:50.810
- It's the only way--
- It's not the only way.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.845
And I'm not doing it.
- What're you so afraid of?

26:52.879 --> 26:56.348
- Don't you dare
say that to me.

26:56.382 --> 26:59.652
That man's life is in my hands
because your fiancГ©e

26:59.686 --> 27:01.287
told him not to
take the deal.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.423
And if we attack the father
and it backfires,

27:04.456 --> 27:07.293
we lose the jury for good
and his life is over.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.696
*

27:09.729 --> 27:11.864
- Jessica, this guy wants to
tell everyone the truth

27:11.898 --> 27:14.366
because he's proud of it.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.736
You just need to lead him right
where he's dying to go.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.037
- And what if
I can't do that?

27:18.070 --> 27:20.106
- Mike has something
that might help.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.808
- What're you talking about?

27:21.841 --> 27:24.443
- I'm asking if you've seen
the movie "A Few Good Men."

27:24.476 --> 27:28.014
*

27:29.882 --> 27:31.851
- Donna, what're you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.419
Because I've been calling you
and texting you

27:33.452 --> 27:34.620
and you obviously haven't
checked your phone.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.723
- I haven't checked my phone
because I've been going to every

27:36.756 --> 27:38.825
client we have reassuring them
that Sutter's gonna recant

27:38.858 --> 27:40.860
his bullshit and Jim Reynolds
isn't going anywhere.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.061
- Yeah, well, if you don't
do something soon,

27:42.094 --> 27:42.962
you're gonna have to
recant that.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.063
- What the hell
are you talking about?

27:44.096 --> 27:44.931
- Jim Reynolds called.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.799
They moved his board meeting
to tomorrow.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.000
*

27:58.778 --> 28:01.380
- We need to talk.
- I don't believe this.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.783
I'm about to give the most
important cross examination

28:03.816 --> 28:04.984
in my life
and you're showing up now?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.786
- Jessica, we left you
a dozen messages.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.487
Jim Reynolds' board
moved up the meeting.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.757
- Then tell them to push it back
because I can't go right now.

28:10.790 --> 28:11.758
- Goddamn it,
don't you get it?

28:11.791 --> 28:13.492
They moved it up so they
can get it over with.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.394
They're gonna fire Reynolds
and they're fire us.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.229
And he made it clear that
you need to be there.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.164
- Jessica, Louis is right.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.899
If we show up without you,
we may as well

28:19.932 --> 28:21.734
not show up at all.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.469
- Is the defense
ready to proceed?

28:28.474 --> 28:30.509
- Your Honor, I'd like to ask
for a half-day continuance.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.178
- On what grounds?

28:32.211 --> 28:33.880
- It has to do with
my law firm's survival.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.815
- Then let her associate take
the reins for half a day.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.283
- She's not ready for this.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.384
- Well, she was ready
for the other thing.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.787
- That was different
and the prosecution knows it.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.755
- What I know is whatever's
happening with your firm

28:42.789 --> 28:44.256
is not my concern.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.892
So either let your associate
handle this

28:45.925 --> 28:46.893
or handle it yourself.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.395
But this case
is moving forward.

28:49.428 --> 28:56.402
*

28:56.435 --> 28:58.437
- Do whatever you can.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.841
I'm not abandoning Leonard to
some corporate power struggle.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.409
- This isn't a goddamn
power struggle.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.311
We're gonna go
out of business.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.847
- I can't think about that
right now, Louis.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.481
That man's life
is on the line,

29:09.515 --> 29:10.983
and I'm not hanging him
out to dry.

29:11.017 --> 29:15.454
- Ms. Pearson,
are you ready to proceed?

29:15.487 --> 29:17.523
- We are, Your Honor.

29:17.556 --> 29:20.459
Defense would like to recall
Victor Forrest to the stand.

29:20.492 --> 29:27.433
*

29:31.370 --> 29:33.072
- Jessica, what a surprise.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.075
You never come to my office.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.343
When did you get home
from school?

29:37.376 --> 29:38.845
- This morning.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.012
- Oh, if I'd known
you were coming--

29:40.046 --> 29:41.948
- I didn't want you
to know, Dad.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.415
I have some news.
- What is it?

29:43.449 --> 29:44.183
Is everything okay?

29:44.216 --> 29:46.252
- I got into Harvard Law
next year.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.319
And I'm going.
- What?

29:47.353 --> 29:49.355
- I'm going to be a lawyer.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.423
- What happened to our plan of
you becoming surgeon?

29:51.457 --> 29:54.060
- That was never our plan, Dad.
It was always yours.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.361
- Don't you speak to me
like that.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.830
- I'm not speaking to you
like anything.

29:57.864 --> 29:58.998
I'm telling you the truth.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.499
- You want the truth?

30:00.532 --> 30:02.368
Doctors save lives
and lawyers are nothing but

30:02.401 --> 30:03.870
power-hungry bottom-feeders.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.504
- They don't have to be
and I'm not going to be.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.373
- And I raised you better.
- No, Dad.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.508
You raised me to do
what inspires me.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.878
And what inspires me
is to be a lawyer.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.412
- You go to that school,

30:13.445 --> 30:15.514
you're gonna get infected with
their lawyer mind-set

30:15.547 --> 30:17.516
and when you come out,
you're not gonna

30:17.549 --> 30:20.853
give a shit about
your fellow man.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.388
- If you think that,
then you should've

30:22.421 --> 30:25.391
spent more time with me.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.393
Because you don't
know me at all.

30:27.426 --> 30:34.033
*

30:35.935 --> 30:38.137
- Ms. Pearson?

30:38.170 --> 30:40.940
Ms. Pearson, are you ready?

30:51.350 --> 30:54.120
- Mr. Forrest...

30:54.153 --> 30:58.357
so many lives
were ruined that night.

30:58.390 --> 31:01.961
Your daughter's,
her boyfriend's, yours.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.362
- Is there a question?

31:03.395 --> 31:05.131
- Someone had to pay for that,
didn't they?

31:05.164 --> 31:06.899
- Yeah, they sure as hell did.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.334
- Is that why you paid
for Maria Gomez

31:08.367 --> 31:10.636
to go to rehab
to keep her from testifying

31:10.669 --> 31:11.470
at Mr. Bailey's trial?

31:11.503 --> 31:13.439
- What?

31:13.472 --> 31:15.674
- Objection, Your Honor, she's
putting the victim on trial.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.576
- My client is the victim here.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.345
- Ms. Pearson, you better back
this up fast.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.047
- Then ask the witness
to answer my question.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.182
- I never even heard of that
woman until yesterday.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.417
- Your Honor, the defense would
like to admit into evidence

31:25.451 --> 31:27.653
the admissions form for
an Allison Dobsen

31:27.686 --> 31:30.522
into the Pathways Rehabilitation
Center from 12 years ago.

31:30.556 --> 31:31.924
- Wha--who is that?

31:31.958 --> 31:33.025
- She was Maria Gomez's
roommate.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.526
And I'm gonna put her
on the stand.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.195
- No, that's can't be.
No--you can't do that.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.430
- And she's going to say
that Maria told her

31:38.464 --> 31:41.067
that she felt terrible about
abandoning her friend.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.468
- Objection, hearsay.
- No, she won't.

31:42.501 --> 31:43.369
- Overruled.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.071
- And she's going to testify
that you paid

31:45.104 --> 31:45.904
for Maria to be there.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.539
- I had nothing
to do with anything.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.075
- That's not what
she's going to say.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.943
- I don't care, she's lying.
- Why would she lie?

31:50.977 --> 31:52.478
She just wants to put
the record straight.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.013
- The record is straight.
- Not according to her roommate.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.647
- She's lying!
- Objection, badgering.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.516
- How could you know?

31:57.549 --> 31:59.518
- Because Maria Gomez didn't
have a roommate!

31:59.551 --> 32:01.220
*

32:01.253 --> 32:02.488
- What did you just say?

32:02.521 --> 32:04.023
- Yes, I paid for her.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.058
Because she's a junkie who'd say
anything to get him

32:06.092 --> 32:07.593
out of what he did,
so I got her out of the way

32:07.626 --> 32:08.627
'cause he did it.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.462
- Mr. Forrest--
- He did it!

32:10.496 --> 32:17.436
*

32:20.539 --> 32:22.674
- Your Honor...

32:22.708 --> 32:27.046
the defense asks that
Mr. Bailey be exonerated

32:27.079 --> 32:29.181
and his sentence be commuted
immediately.

32:31.117 --> 32:34.053
- Mr. Marsden?

32:34.086 --> 32:35.554
- We have no objections,
Your Honor.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.456
- Then the jury
may be excused.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.992
And Mr. Bailey...

32:40.026 --> 32:41.060
you're free.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.061
[gavel bangs]

32:42.094 --> 32:43.662
[uplifting music]

32:43.695 --> 32:45.264
- I can't believe it.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.033
We did it.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.034
- We did it.

32:48.067 --> 32:55.041
*

33:01.680 --> 33:05.151
- I can't thank you enough.

33:05.184 --> 33:08.754
- You don't have to thank me,
Leonard.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.790
You just have to walk out
that door.

33:11.823 --> 33:18.764
*

33:31.310 --> 33:38.250
*

33:43.755 --> 33:45.591
- That was one hell
of a cross.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.226
- Well, I'd like to say
it was no big deal,

33:47.259 --> 33:49.195
but I'd be lying if
I didn't say

33:49.228 --> 33:51.763
it was the most satisfying
moment of my entire career.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.666
What's this?

33:54.700 --> 33:56.668
- Got a call from
Jim Reynolds.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.204
He said that if you didn't
show today,

33:58.237 --> 33:59.738
they were gonna
sign with me.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.074
And we both know
you didn't show.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.042
- You want to merge?

34:06.212 --> 34:08.313
- I said all that stuff about
rivals because I didn't want to

34:08.347 --> 34:11.117
say this in front of Harvey.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.219
But I know you tanked
the Sutter case for Mike

34:14.253 --> 34:16.588
and I can see what
you've been doing for Rachel.

34:16.621 --> 34:19.591
So this isn't just
professional.

34:19.625 --> 34:20.659
For me, it's personal.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.328
- Robert--
- Jessica,

34:22.360 --> 34:24.130
you got to knock down
the mountain.

34:24.163 --> 34:27.632
Without help, you're not gonna
be able get back up.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.635
Please, take my hand.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.538
- I appreciate your offer

34:32.571 --> 34:35.641
more than you know, Robert.

34:35.674 --> 34:38.110
But I've had my name first
for too long.

34:38.143 --> 34:40.146
I can't go back
to having it last.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.580
- Jessica, if you don't do this,

34:41.612 --> 34:43.149
you're not gonna have it
anywhere.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.783
- Then so be it.

34:44.815 --> 34:47.853
Besides, we both know lawyers
are nothing but

34:47.886 --> 34:50.589
power-hungry
bottom-feeders, anyway.

34:50.621 --> 34:56.862
*

35:04.670 --> 35:07.406
- You two don't look like
.Jessica Pearson.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.208
Then again, it doesn't really
matter,

35:09.241 --> 35:12.611
because in 15 minutes, your firm
is no longer going to be

35:12.644 --> 35:13.912
in the employ of this company.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.681
- Maybe not.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.416
But while we are,
I think you're gonna need

35:17.449 --> 35:18.584
one more chair.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.718
- What're you
talking about?

35:19.751 --> 35:22.188
- We're talking about your
brand new largest shareholder.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.255
- What shareholder?

35:23.289 --> 35:25.557
- Hey, guy.
Stu Buzzini.

35:25.591 --> 35:26.892
This one at the head of
the table looks good to me.

35:26.925 --> 35:27.926
[clears throat]

35:27.959 --> 35:29.228
- Look, I don't care who you are

35:29.261 --> 35:30.662
or how many shares you bought.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.897
You're not a member
of this board.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.932
- No, but as of next quarter,
I will be.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.734
So either you keep
these two as your lawyers

35:35.767 --> 35:37.669
and Jim Reynolds
as your CEO,

35:37.703 --> 35:39.671
or at our next meeting,
you'll be out on your ass.

35:39.705 --> 35:40.806
- You can't do this to me.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.241
- That's where you're wrong,
Donald.

35:42.274 --> 35:43.942
We can and we did.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.744
Because he just
bought up your company

35:45.777 --> 35:47.646
and you messed with the wrong
goddamn Marine.

35:47.679 --> 35:48.847
- What the hell
are you talking about?

35:48.880 --> 35:50.616
- Yeah, what are you
talkin' about?

35:50.649 --> 35:53.285
- He's quoting "A Few Good Men."
- Finally, somebody gets me.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.953
- I got your back, bro.
- Don't bro me, dude.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.922
- You got it, Chief.
- Hey, can I get in on this?

35:56.955 --> 35:58.890
both: No.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.893
*

36:01.927 --> 36:03.662
[door opens, closes]

36:03.695 --> 36:04.663
[keys clatter]

36:04.696 --> 36:07.833
*

36:07.866 --> 36:10.602
- Hey.

36:10.636 --> 36:11.770
- I got you a present.

36:11.803 --> 36:15.474
- [giggles]

36:15.507 --> 36:17.976
You didn't have to
do that.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.945
- I know.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.582
I know we're not supposed to
take pictures in there,

36:23.615 --> 36:26.585
but I couldn't help myself.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.922
- This is unbelievable.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.291
- No.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.893
What you did for that man
is unbelievable.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.935
[poignant acoustic music]

36:43.969 --> 36:45.237
*

36:45.271 --> 36:48.607
Harvey offered me a job.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.942
Back to the firm...

36:50.976 --> 36:54.580
as a consultant.

36:54.613 --> 36:57.349
- What are you gonna do?

36:57.383 --> 36:58.984
- I don't know.

36:59.017 --> 37:06.224
*

37:10.396 --> 37:12.731
- What is that, a cup of tea?

37:12.764 --> 37:14.900
- Just a moment of
quiet reflection.

37:14.933 --> 37:15.901
- Well, to hell with that.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.369
This is a moment
for celebration.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.305
- That's right.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.039
'Cause a man's life wasn't
the only thing saved today.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.808
- Don't tell me.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.876
You managed to lock down
Jim Reynolds after all.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.912
- We did.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.881
The firm is safe, Jessica.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.683
- Thank you.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.824
But it's not my firm
anymore.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.596
It's yours.

37:44.630 --> 37:45.831
- What do you mean, "ours"?

37:45.864 --> 37:47.833
- I mean,
I've decided to step down.

37:47.866 --> 37:48.867
- What?
- Jessica--

37:48.900 --> 37:50.569
- Listen,
somewhere along the way,

37:50.602 --> 37:53.739
I forgot why I became a lawyer
in the first place.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.074
And it wasn't just to fight
for money and power.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.776
It was to fight
for something more.

37:57.809 --> 37:58.877
- Bullshit, you're not fighting
for something more,

37:58.910 --> 37:59.878
you're running away.

37:59.911 --> 38:00.812
- Louis--
- No.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.748
We bust our ass to
save this goddamn place,

38:02.781 --> 38:03.815
she decides to up and leave?

38:03.849 --> 38:04.950
We committed to this.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.718
- Louis, she isn't
doing this to you.

38:06.752 --> 38:07.986
She's doing it for herself.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.055
- I don't give a shit
why she's doing it.

38:10.088 --> 38:12.958
It's selfish and self-serving
and it's not gonna happen.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.961
- Do you think I want to
goddamn want do this, Louis?

38:15.994 --> 38:17.696
I have to do this.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.365
- You can't just throw this all
away after we gave

38:19.398 --> 38:20.366
everything to save it.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.934
- That's enough.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.070
Louis, after the partners left,
we swore we were

38:25.103 --> 38:26.872
gonna dedicate every ounce
of blood, sweat,

38:26.905 --> 38:29.908
and tears we had
to this place.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.077
But we didn't.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.680
Harvey and I focused on
getting Mike out,

38:34.713 --> 38:36.948
Jessica and Rachel focused on
Leonard Bailey,

38:36.982 --> 38:39.418
and you focused on
finding love in your life.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.920
[stirring music]

38:41.953 --> 38:44.723
- That's not true.
- Yes it is.

38:44.756 --> 38:49.060
*

38:49.094 --> 38:51.129
- I'm not ready to
give up the firm.

38:51.162 --> 38:55.901
- No one's saying you have to
give up the firm, Louis.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.136
You just have to
let me go.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.873
*

39:01.907 --> 39:05.110
- You sure about this?

39:05.143 --> 39:07.646
- Tell you the truth,

39:07.679 --> 39:10.081
for first time in my life,

39:10.115 --> 39:11.683
I'm not sure about anything,

39:11.717 --> 39:15.086
and it scares the shit
out of me.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.088
But I'm sure
I have to do this.

39:17.122 --> 39:21.860
*

39:21.893 --> 39:23.995
- To Pearson Specter Litt.

39:24.029 --> 39:30.101
*

39:30.135 --> 39:32.170
all: To Pearson Specter Litt.

39:32.203 --> 39:39.377
*

39:47.953 --> 39:54.726
*

40:07.072 --> 40:08.940
- [knocks]

40:08.974 --> 40:10.208
You busy?

40:10.241 --> 40:11.843
- Of course not.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.712
- I know you told me
to sleep on it.

40:13.745 --> 40:17.182
I didn't know if that meant
take a day, two days.

40:17.215 --> 40:19.084
I've never really been in
this position before.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.488
- Louis, I'm sorry--
- Here's the thing.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.856
I tried to sleep on it,

40:24.890 --> 40:27.526
and all I could do was picture
a life without you

40:27.559 --> 40:29.728
and your beautiful
unborn baby

40:29.761 --> 40:31.229
and it just made me
crazy to think

40:31.262 --> 40:34.099
I wouldn't be part a of it.

40:34.132 --> 40:37.102
But Tara, you need to know that
I am not gonna say yes

40:37.135 --> 40:40.171
today and change my mind
tomorrow.

40:40.205 --> 40:42.107
And I don't know how to
give you that reassurance

40:42.140 --> 40:44.910
without asking you
something first.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.848
[poignant music]

40:49.881 --> 40:52.017
- Oh, my God, Louis.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.019
*

40:54.052 --> 40:56.988
- Tara Messer.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.857
Will you marry me?

40:58.890 --> 41:01.159
*

41:01.192 --> 41:04.830
- Yes, Louis.
I'll marry you.

41:04.863 --> 41:11.102
*

41:11.136 --> 41:13.004
Oh.

41:13.038 --> 41:19.811
*

41:26.184 --> 41:28.887
- Jessica.

41:28.920 --> 41:29.988
What're you doing here?

41:30.021 --> 41:34.092
- I wanted to talk to you
before you left for Chicago.

41:34.125 --> 41:36.962
- I'm glad, but I wouldn't have
left without saying good-bye.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.798
- I didn't just come here
to say good-bye.

41:42.601 --> 41:47.038
I came to see what you think
about me coming with you.

41:47.072 --> 41:48.306
- What about the firm?

41:48.339 --> 41:50.842
- I'm leaving the firm.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.111
- Jessica, if you're walking
away from everything for me--

41:53.144 --> 41:56.147
- No, I'm not doing this
just for you.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.049
I'm doing this for me.

41:58.083 --> 42:01.119
*

42:01.152 --> 42:05.056
I don't want to be
a corporate lawyer anymore.

42:05.090 --> 42:09.595
So, if you don't want me to come
to Chicago with you,

42:09.628 --> 42:12.631
I won't.

42:12.664 --> 42:15.100
But I'm walking away

42:15.133 --> 42:16.835
no matter what.

42:16.868 --> 42:22.674
*

42:22.708 --> 42:25.110
- Then walk away with me.

42:25.143 --> 42:32.117
*

42:49.267 --> 42:51.670
- You gonna be okay?

42:51.703 --> 42:53.872
- She was my mentor.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.274
*

42:56.307 --> 42:58.176
But yeah,
I'm gonna be okay.

42:58.209 --> 43:01.212
*

43:01.246 --> 43:04.215
- You want to be alone?

43:04.249 --> 43:06.084
- No.

43:06.117 --> 43:13.058
*
