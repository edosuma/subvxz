WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:05.771
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
You killed 12 of my countrymen.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.507
(yells)
I will never
forgive you for this.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.110
Lord castleroy, I heard
what you did for leith.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.212
<i>Getting him out of jail,</i>
<i>into the army.</i>

00:13.214 --> 00:15.748
Castleroy:
<i>I didn't do it for him.</i>
<i>I did it for you.</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:17.516
My mother is a catholic ally.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.119
She is under attack.
Enemies screaming for her head.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.254
And no one cares.
But the duke of guise?

00:22.256 --> 00:24.289
Mary:
<i>Do you know anyone else</i>
<i>with an army as large?</i>

00:24.291 --> 00:27.760
Or as loyal?
Your men will report to me
as they would to you.

00:27.762 --> 00:30.262
But why would you
need my men...?
I'm going with you to scotland.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.764
French forces marched
for calais this morning.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.132
Henry, you're not well.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.700
We can take calais.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.301
Any fool knows he can't do that.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.504
It's true,
father's army would fail

00:38.506 --> 00:41.140
On its own...
But two armies...

00:41.142 --> 00:42.775
Do you mean the duke's army?
Mary's army?

00:42.777 --> 00:45.444
Mary will have to understand.
I have no choice.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.113
Francis is trying
to save his country.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.783
<i>And I can forgive him for that</i>
<i>as I hope he will forgive me</i>

00:50.785 --> 00:53.185
For doing what needs
to be done for scotland.

00:55.321 --> 00:57.489
(crows squawking)

00:59.125 --> 01:00.793
Man:
The english attacked at dawn.

01:00.795 --> 01:03.462
It took almost
everything we had,

01:03.464 --> 01:05.264
But we beat them back.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.733
Between the constant attacks
and desertions,

01:07.735 --> 01:09.701
We won't be able
to hold the line.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.136
Where's your commander?

01:11.138 --> 01:13.138
Dead. Who's asking?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.473
The dauphin of France.

01:14.475 --> 01:17.109
Stand when you address him.

01:18.711 --> 01:19.812
The english have been
on our soil in calais

01:19.814 --> 01:20.846
For two centuries.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.314
I, for one, am tired

01:22.316 --> 01:24.683
Of seeing them attack our lines.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.852
I'm sure you are, too.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.555
That's why you're not gonna hold
this outpost anymore.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.156
You're going to advance.

01:31.158 --> 01:32.424
But we've lost
half our company.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.226
The english know that.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.294
That's why they keep attacking,

01:35.296 --> 01:36.295
Taking a few of us each time,

01:36.297 --> 01:38.097
Until we can't fight anymore

01:38.099 --> 01:39.198
And are forced to retreat.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.432
We're in danger
of losing this war

01:40.434 --> 01:41.700
If we don't act.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.303
The soldiers that you repelled

01:44.305 --> 01:46.305
This morning come
from the castle of montmorency.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.608
That castle stands between us
and our route to calais.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.111
If we take it, we clear the way.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.313
So the duke of guise can stop
holding the english back

01:54.315 --> 01:56.315
On the eastern front,
and push his men through

01:56.317 --> 01:58.183
Where the english aren't
prepared to defend themselves.

01:59.352 --> 02:00.586
He has thousands of men.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.187
But there's 12 of us.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.490
You want us to take a castle?

02:04.492 --> 02:06.325
Not you alone.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.260
All the men along
the line will advance as well.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.596
My lord, your grace.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.198
The english have been spotted,
headed this way.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.333
We need to get you to safety.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.634
So much for advancing

02:15.636 --> 02:16.869
To a bloody castle.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.204
Send word to the duke.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.206
Tell him to get here
as soon as he can.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.474
Your grace, you can't stay.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.643
If the english see you
on horseback,

02:24.645 --> 02:26.478
If they even recognize you
as a noble,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.147
They'll take you out first.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.218
Meet your new commander.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.687
We're advancing
to a bloody castle.

02:39.359 --> 02:41.360
Greer:
<i>We missed you at breakfast.</i>

02:41.362 --> 02:43.228
It's not healthy to spend
so much time alone.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.229
I know, I'm sorry.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.764
I'm just worried
about francis.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.799
I know you parted
on painful terms.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.701
He took men meant for
my mother's protection

02:49.703 --> 02:53.372
To save french soldiers.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.574
I know he had to.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.544
Thousands of frenchmen
would have died otherwise.

02:58.546 --> 03:01.246
Do all married couples
have these struggles?

03:01.248 --> 03:03.415
I think you've redefined
marital discord.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.217
(laughs)

03:12.659 --> 03:14.526
Mary, what is it?

03:14.528 --> 03:16.395
That guard.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.198
Every time I see him,
I want to gouge his eyes out.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.466
Why on earth? Who is he?

03:21.468 --> 03:23.869
Your grace,
pardon my intrusion,

03:23.871 --> 03:25.671
But there's an urgent
letter for you.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.673
Ah, my cousins!

03:27.675 --> 03:29.474
(laughs)

03:29.476 --> 03:32.811
Roman, how lovely to see you.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.813
Ah.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.281
Hortensa.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.983
You look well, catherine.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.484
Given the circumstances.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.553
What circumstances are those?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.855
That your husband has
left the castle again.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.458
I hear he's with a
mistress in paris.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.460
Usually you time your visits

03:48.462 --> 03:50.562
Around henry's availability.

03:50.564 --> 03:54.499
Though it could be said
he's in a bad temper of late.

03:54.501 --> 03:58.303
So you would have enjoyed
his company less than usual.

03:58.305 --> 03:59.905
I always enjoy his company.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.441
As I know he always
greatly enjoyed mine.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.976
Except for the day
when he left you in tears

04:03.978 --> 04:05.777
Because he decided to marry me.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.714
Oh, life is full of surprises,
isn't it?

04:08.716 --> 04:09.781
Roman has trade.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.583
As for me,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.318
I've come to reclaim
the team of men I loaned you.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.520
I need them for a job
back in florence.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.256
I assume you have no objection

04:17.258 --> 04:18.490
As they've already
served their purpose?

04:18.492 --> 04:19.491
Mary.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.026
These are my cousins.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.328
Hortensa, roman de medici.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.863
Mary, queen of scotland.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.266
I remember you as a child.

04:27.268 --> 04:30.335
So talkative, free with words.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.337
Catherine, could I have
a private word with you?

04:32.339 --> 04:33.739
Oh, there you go.

04:33.741 --> 04:34.873
More words.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.009
Of course.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.477
Uh, beatrice, will you please

04:38.479 --> 04:40.045
Show my cousins
to their chambers

04:40.047 --> 04:41.346
And stay with them

04:41.348 --> 04:44.016
To ensure their comfort?

04:44.018 --> 04:46.285
Mary, what is it?

04:46.287 --> 04:47.753
Mary: I've received a
letter from my mother.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.354
Marie de guise.

04:49.356 --> 04:50.889
The protestant insurgents
surrounding her castle

04:50.891 --> 04:52.391
Are demanding blood.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.026
It's no longer a case
of fighting them.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.527
If she has any hope of survival,

04:55.529 --> 04:57.796
She needs to escape in secret.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.631
But she needs money to do so.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.367
For guards, transport,
bribes if necessary.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.802
(sighs)

05:03.804 --> 05:05.304
Well, this is awful.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.772
But why are you coming to me?

05:06.774 --> 05:08.307
You know that I can't...
She also wrote to me

05:08.309 --> 05:10.409
Of a time when you feared
for your life.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.777
You wrote to my mother
asking for help.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.045
And she came through

05:13.047 --> 05:15.314
With a loan of 50,000 crowns

05:15.316 --> 05:18.317
To recruit an army.
I never used that money.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.552
Well, you never
gave it back, either.
I've exchanged

05:20.554 --> 05:22.988
Ten times that amount
with your mother.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.457
Is this really
about an old debt?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.659
No. It's about how it feels

05:27.661 --> 05:30.595
To be a female ruler,
trapped and alone.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.532
If anyone knows how terrifying
that is, it is you.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.733
And I'd help if I could.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.335
But all of the court's money

05:36.337 --> 05:38.470
Is tied up in the
war with calais.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.972
I'm not talking
about the court's money.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.541
I'm talking about your money.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.409
The funds you keep hidden.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.445
Just in case you have
to leave France in a hurry.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.813
I don't...
Don't try to deny it.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.414
Not six months ago,

05:49.416 --> 05:51.550
You escaped the tower
and were ready to disappear

05:51.552 --> 05:53.085
Because henry wanted you dead.

05:53.087 --> 05:56.121
How were you going
to support yourself in exile?

05:56.123 --> 05:58.123
You and my mother
were friends once.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.092
I wish her well.

06:00.094 --> 06:02.828
There is no hidden money.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.363
Catherine, I beg of you!

06:04.365 --> 06:06.898
You're a queen!
Don't beg.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.433
It invites

06:08.435 --> 06:10.102
Sympathy, then pity,

06:10.104 --> 06:12.871
Then disdain.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.007
Give the impression
that you're weak,

06:16.009 --> 06:18.643
And you'll soon need
a secret fund.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.119
(creaking nearby)

06:27.121 --> 06:28.854
That's all. You may go.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.734
Who's there?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.136
John priveaux.

06:44.138 --> 06:45.737
At your service.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.172
I wondered when
you'd get here.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.540
You weren't seen?

06:48.542 --> 06:49.608
I'm never seen.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.742
And yet your name is known

06:50.744 --> 06:51.743
In certain circles.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.045
Your uncle's for one?

06:54.047 --> 06:56.481
He has spoken of your rise
in your field.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.783
A man who gets
the job done.

06:57.785 --> 06:58.784
A mercenary.

06:58.786 --> 06:59.885
Your messenger said you had

06:59.887 --> 07:01.486
An urgent matter to discuss.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.956
Queen catherine has
a secret stash

07:04.958 --> 07:07.526
Of gold somewhere
for emergencies.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.628
I need you to find it
and bring it to me.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.163
I would have preferred to
have not used your services,

07:11.165 --> 07:14.032
But I gave catherine the option

07:14.034 --> 07:15.634
Of being a human being

07:15.636 --> 07:18.437
And saving a life,
and she refused.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.172
Was that wise?

07:20.174 --> 07:22.174
Considering you're
about to steal it?

07:22.176 --> 07:24.443
Done right, she won't
even notice it's gone.

07:24.445 --> 07:25.777
Perhaps not for months.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.212
By then, it will be too late.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.213
Fair enough.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.515
I'll have it
for you in two days.

07:30.517 --> 07:31.716
Well, how will you go about it?

07:31.718 --> 07:33.552
You don't want the details.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.920
I won't have blood spilled

07:34.922 --> 07:36.521
If that's what you're intending.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.557
No one intends to spill blood.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.058
But plans go awry.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.993
Obstacles come up.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.929
I can't be expected
to finish my job

07:43.931 --> 07:46.064
With half my tools.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.466
No innocent blood then.

07:47.468 --> 07:48.934
Promise me.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.536
I can promise I'll try.

07:51.538 --> 07:54.105
But if it gets
in the way of success...

07:54.107 --> 07:57.609
You will keep me apprised before
any serious action is taken.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.911
Leave everything to me.

08:11.557 --> 08:13.758
Forgive me, father.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.694
Since my last confession,

08:15.696 --> 08:17.796
I have taken the lord's name
in vain many times.

08:17.798 --> 08:22.501
And ordered the assassination
of a dozen scottish visitors.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.603
I struck my servant.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.705
A slap, which I regret,

08:26.707 --> 08:28.640
As it was a loss
of self-control.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.575
And she's been sulky ever since.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.744
Also, my cousin

08:32.746 --> 08:35.113
Hortensa is here.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.848
Expect worse of me.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.117
I loathe her.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.820
I'm prepared for my penance.

08:44.123 --> 08:47.058
(thumping nearby)

08:47.060 --> 08:49.661
Father?

08:50.796 --> 08:51.963
(gasps)

08:54.867 --> 08:56.935
(muffled screaming)

08:59.071 --> 09:02.674
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

09:04.744 --> 09:08.880
♪ they all need
something to hold on to ♪

09:08.882 --> 09:11.883
♪ they all mean well

09:11.885 --> 09:14.920
♪ you could never
feel my story ♪

09:14.922 --> 09:19.157
♪ it's all you know... Oh!

09:20.826 --> 09:23.094
♪

09:31.203 --> 09:33.204
Oh, come, bash, the air is
bracing, we're all young

09:33.206 --> 09:35.774
And wed, and you must shake
this black mood.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.242
There's nothing that you can do.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.178
That's exactly
the problem, isn't it?

09:40.180 --> 09:42.247
I'm here while thousands bleed
from english swords.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.315
And my brother...

09:43.317 --> 09:45.083
Francis will survive the war.

09:45.085 --> 09:45.984
You must believe that.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.686
It's true, bash.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.155
There's no point in
imagining anything else.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.024
Come play.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.062
(grunts)

09:57.064 --> 09:58.263
(laughs)

10:00.066 --> 10:03.001
Is that as good as you've got?

10:03.003 --> 10:04.769
(laughs)

10:07.073 --> 10:09.674
(speaks indistinctly)

10:12.945 --> 10:14.012
(laughs)

10:15.114 --> 10:16.081
(groans)

10:16.083 --> 10:17.882
Lola!

10:20.953 --> 10:21.953
Are you all right?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.021
It's just a cramp.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.689
Uh, they've been happening.

10:24.691 --> 10:27.125
But this one...
Uh, perhaps I should lie down.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.028
We need to take care of you.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.734
Francis:
We'll stop and rest here.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.402
Gaston: How much further
to the english line, sir?

10:37.404 --> 10:39.170
Francis:
Just a few miles.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.974
(twigs snapping)

10:42.976 --> 10:45.176
(shouting)

10:51.117 --> 10:52.917
(grunting)

11:10.002 --> 11:12.804
Aah!

11:17.276 --> 11:18.810
(grunts)

11:25.785 --> 11:28.353
(man roaring)

11:36.429 --> 11:37.896
What is your name?

11:37.898 --> 11:40.098
Leith bayard, sir.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.767
I am in your debt,
leith bayard.

11:46.305 --> 11:49.107
I told him you were
a good luck charm.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.176
Who'd kill the
dauphin of France?

11:52.244 --> 11:54.713
We were safe with you.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.115
I'm not a good luck charm.

11:58.784 --> 12:01.019
Gaston:
No.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.358
(rattling)

12:07.360 --> 12:10.028
(panting)

12:15.067 --> 12:16.201
I know you're there.

12:17.336 --> 12:18.870
Oh, you're wise

12:18.872 --> 12:20.739
Not to speak,
though it tells me more

12:20.741 --> 12:23.274
Than you think.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.343
For one thing,

12:25.345 --> 12:27.212
This has nothing
to do with the war.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.948
If it did,
our negotiations

12:29.950 --> 12:31.483
Would be much more
in the open.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.752
You'd be boasting about
your english superiority.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.754
(breathing hard)

12:35.756 --> 12:37.288
And for another,
it tells me

12:37.290 --> 12:38.957
That you don't
intend to kill me...

12:40.493 --> 12:42.894
...At least not yet.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.229
Which means you want something.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.765
Information,
perhaps?

12:47.533 --> 12:49.968
Money?

12:49.970 --> 12:52.036
And since you got into
the castle so easily,

12:52.038 --> 12:55.240
You either work there--
unlikely--

12:55.242 --> 12:57.108
Or you're a mercenary,

12:57.110 --> 13:00.378
Hired to kidnap me
for someone else.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.848
Someone close to me,

13:03.850 --> 13:07.252
In desperate need of funds,

13:07.254 --> 13:09.788
Who has long had it in for me.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.022
(laughs breathlessly)

13:11.024 --> 13:13.191
A young queen, perhaps?

13:17.296 --> 13:18.863
The good news is,

13:18.865 --> 13:20.832
You've chosen
your victim wisely.

13:22.268 --> 13:25.870
I'll double
whatever they offered.

13:25.872 --> 13:29.207
But you must bring me the head

13:29.209 --> 13:31.543
Of the person
responsible for this.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.480
Do we have a deal?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.882
(floorboards creaking)

13:46.425 --> 13:50.161
Oh, there you go,
that's a nice kick.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.830
The baby's well.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.064
You'll be fine, too.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.299
Bit of blood
isn't anything

13:54.301 --> 13:56.334
As long as it stops,
and yours did.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.602
Rest here a bit.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.370
Thank you, agnes.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.312
Would you like more water?

14:07.314 --> 14:09.247
Another
pillow?

14:09.249 --> 14:11.382
I think all I need is rest.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.251
It's getting harder
as the weeks go by.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.353
You're sharing a bed
with two of us,

14:15.355 --> 14:16.955
One who steals the covers

14:16.957 --> 14:18.323
And the other one kicks
and turns all night.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.325
(laughs)

14:20.327 --> 14:22.360
Perhaps I should
sleep in my quarters
this evening.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.296
That's not what I want.
Not at all.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.368
You've been so kind to me.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.338
A better husband than
I could have hoped for.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.606
Or might deserve.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.007
Don't
do that.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.276
All I meant was,
I've been happy.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.945
Really and truly happy
these last months.

14:40.947 --> 14:43.214
When I think of how things
might have gone for me...

14:43.216 --> 14:45.283
I'd be facing moments
like this alone,

14:45.285 --> 14:47.385
Save for some
cold nuns around me,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.087
Judging me.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.622
I'm glad I'm a step up
from a nunnery.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.124
I am a bit scared

14:53.126 --> 14:54.359
About giving birth.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.227
I know you fear
it as well.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.263
It's dangerous
for women.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.297
Lola...

14:59.299 --> 15:00.498
Would you be with me?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.634
At my side?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.037
I-I think you'll be
in better hands

15:06.039 --> 15:07.272
With your lady friends.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.407
I want to hold <i>your</i> hand.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.376
You make me feel safe.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.078
I need...
You don't.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.515
I always want to be
there for you.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.517
That's not the same

15:19.519 --> 15:21.119
As saying you'll be with me.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.587
I, uh...

15:22.589 --> 15:24.923
It's all right, I understand.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.191
It's not common for men
to witness childbirth...

15:27.193 --> 15:28.259
It's not
that.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.528
If I'm careful with my words,

15:30.530 --> 15:33.298
It's only so you'll understand.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.200
You have a strength
you have yet to realize.

15:37.202 --> 15:38.436
Remember that.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.505
Always.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.410
What do you mean,
the queen has been kidnapped?

15:45.412 --> 15:47.345
I would keep
your voice down,

15:47.347 --> 15:50.281
Unless you're trying to
alert the entire country

15:50.283 --> 15:51.616
To the vulnerability
of henry's court.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.452
Someone slipped this note

15:54.454 --> 15:55.687
Under my chamber door

15:55.689 --> 15:57.288
Ten minutes ago.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.090
"20,000 francs

15:59.092 --> 16:00.558
"to be delivered to the base

16:00.560 --> 16:03.361
Of the louis xi obelisk
by sundown tomorrow."

16:03.363 --> 16:05.163
Good lord.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.631
As you're the last
royal in the castle,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.499
I thought it prudent
to let you know.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.469
In case you want to do
anything about it.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.171
What do
you mean?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.372
The medici family

16:14.374 --> 16:15.573
Has a long-standing
tradition

16:15.575 --> 16:18.042
Not to negotiate
with kidnappers.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.345
If we bowed to their demands,

16:20.347 --> 16:22.246
We would never be safe.

16:22.248 --> 16:25.249
Well, what of catherine?
Well, perhaps henry
will pay the ransom.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.317
It will take days

16:26.319 --> 16:27.986
To get word to
him in paris,

16:27.988 --> 16:29.620
Long after
the deadline.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.322
The letter makes it clear

16:31.324 --> 16:33.458
That if we do not
give into the demands,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.994
Catherine's body will be
dumped at the castle gates.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.362
My dear,

16:37.364 --> 16:39.330
I've been in
this situation before,

16:39.332 --> 16:40.598
And there are really only

16:40.600 --> 16:42.367
Two possible outcomes.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.068
Either catherine's kidnappers

16:44.070 --> 16:45.470
Intend to return her alive--

16:45.472 --> 16:47.472
In which case,
they'll certainly

16:47.474 --> 16:49.107
Wait a few days
for the ransom--

16:49.109 --> 16:51.209
Or they don't.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.512
In which case, there's really
no rush to do anything.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.447
(door opens)

16:57.750 --> 16:59.417
A servant just dropped
this off at my door.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.085
She said it was found
at the castle gate.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.792
(gasps)
my god.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.360
That earring...

17:09.362 --> 17:10.395
It's catherine's.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.230
(sighs)

17:12.232 --> 17:14.265
Then there is a third
possible outcome.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.435
The kidnappers intend
to return catherine alive,

17:17.437 --> 17:18.770
But in pieces.

17:18.772 --> 17:20.772
Our policy is clear.

17:20.774 --> 17:25.043
We simply can't give in
to their demands.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.649
The castle of montmorency
lies before us,

17:31.651 --> 17:34.252
Ours for the taking.
What makes you

17:34.254 --> 17:36.521
So sure we'll take it?
Did you see the men
who attacked us this morning?

17:36.523 --> 17:37.822
I was too busy
soiling my pants,
your grace.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.357
There was a man
with a red beard

17:39.359 --> 17:40.691
And another wearing
a lady's favor.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.427
I saw them before, twice.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.495
Don't you see?

17:44.497 --> 17:47.231
The castle is undermanned.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.500
The same few men
are being sent each time.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.170
They strike fast and withdraw
to deceive us into thinking

17:52.172 --> 17:53.571
That the castle is
too strong to take.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.440
Soon it <i>will</i>
<i>be too strong.</i>

17:55.442 --> 17:56.574
We must get there before

17:56.576 --> 17:57.575
The english
reinforcements arrive.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.576
Wait.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.578
Get in position! Move!

18:00.580 --> 18:01.846
Take cover!

18:06.785 --> 18:08.486
We can't fight that, your grace!

18:08.488 --> 18:10.188
We can't even turn
and run. What now?

18:11.523 --> 18:13.791
We have no choice.
We stay

18:13.793 --> 18:16.260
And finish this,
or we die trying.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.534
Kenna told me that
you were unwell,

18:23.536 --> 18:24.602
That it might
be the baby.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.537
We're both fine,
thank you.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.609
You don't
look fine.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.745
What is it?

18:34.747 --> 18:37.381
I received word
from my family's banker.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.750
The dowry was transferred
to my husband two days ago.

18:39.752 --> 18:40.751
The money
julien

18:40.753 --> 18:42.386
Has been waiting for has arrived

18:42.388 --> 18:43.621
And is in his grasp.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.423
I thought you were
holding it back.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.558
No, the banker
couldn't, not anymore.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.794
Legally, he's owed it.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.662
And worse still, the banker said

18:51.664 --> 18:52.897
Julien had been pressing for it.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.765
That he'd been relentless.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.368
But you have no proof
he needs the money, do you?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.669
No.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.638
But julien married me

19:00.640 --> 19:02.807
Before he loved me,
or I loved him.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.242
And I do love him...

19:04.244 --> 19:06.377
But...

19:06.379 --> 19:08.379
Why would he,
why would any man,

19:08.381 --> 19:10.248
Marry a girl pregnant
with another man's child

19:10.250 --> 19:12.316
Unless he was going to get
something out of it?

19:12.318 --> 19:13.718
And what if he did?

19:13.720 --> 19:16.320
What if he's
secretly broke

19:16.322 --> 19:17.655
And ashamed,
or in debt.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.856
And he met
and married

19:18.858 --> 19:20.658
A very rich girl

19:20.660 --> 19:21.692
Who only married him
because she's pregnant

19:21.694 --> 19:23.794
With another
man's child.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.429
And what if
those two people

19:25.431 --> 19:28.399
Fell in love anyway?

19:28.401 --> 19:30.334
If the end of your story
is a happy one,

19:30.336 --> 19:32.904
Then does how it began
really matter?

19:36.675 --> 19:39.343
I hope lord castleroy
is your happy ending.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.613
Do you think of leith often?

19:43.582 --> 19:45.283
Every day.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.884
I pray for his future,

19:46.886 --> 19:49.554
I pray for his survival...

19:49.556 --> 19:51.789
Even though I'll never
set eyes on him again.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.760
(distant shouting)

19:55.762 --> 19:57.828
English soldier:
Fire!

20:00.766 --> 20:02.567
The english have placed
a wagon full of gunpowder

20:02.569 --> 20:03.834
Next to the cannon,

20:03.836 --> 20:05.570
For ease of
reloading.

20:05.572 --> 20:08.439
One flaming arrow, well-aimed,
would take it out,

20:08.441 --> 20:09.640
As well as the entire
english squad.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.975
You won't make
it ten feet out of

20:10.977 --> 20:12.710
These trees before
you're blown to pieces.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.712
If I acted alone, yes,
but not if we work together.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.314
That cannon can only shoot

20:16.316 --> 20:17.848
In one direction at a time.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.717
If you were to charge
down the right flank,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.485
Drawing its fire,

20:21.487 --> 20:22.887
I could sneak down the left
and get close enough

20:22.889 --> 20:24.455
To take
the shot.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.791
(murmuring)

20:28.227 --> 20:29.860
Calais...
They don't care
about calais.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.799
They know how lords
and generals talk of battle.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.767
The men are chess pieces.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.769
But we don't see
ourselves that way.

20:38.771 --> 20:39.804
No one risks their life

20:39.806 --> 20:40.938
For some lord's
strategy.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.774
We do it for those we love,

20:43.776 --> 20:46.744
For our brothers-in-arms,

20:46.746 --> 20:48.346
And so we don't
look like cowards.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.614
And for money.

20:49.616 --> 20:50.881
(soldier chuckles)

20:50.883 --> 20:53.351
I don't view you
as chess pieces.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.353
Then prove it.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.887
Get us out of here alive.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.489
I can't promise that.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.757
But this is not
a lord's strategy.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.891
This is about
survival.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.027
That cannon is the fist of god.

21:03.029 --> 21:06.430
If we stay here and do nothing,
it will pound us to pieces.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.899
But if we advance,

21:08.901 --> 21:10.901
Dispersed and on the move,

21:10.903 --> 21:13.404
The english won't know
who to target.

21:13.406 --> 21:16.340
It is the best chance
for most of us to survive.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.381
Greer told lola not to worry
about julien, but I worry.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.983
All I'm asking is
that you get close to him,

21:25.985 --> 21:27.852
Feel him out on his finances.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.287
No.
His background?

21:29.289 --> 21:31.389
No.
Well, why not?

21:31.391 --> 21:33.291
You don't want
to pick this marriage apart.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.927
It came together
very quickly.

21:36.929 --> 21:40.531
Let them find their way.

21:40.533 --> 21:43.334
You know.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.536
That lola got pregnant
by someone else.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.405
That's why she rushed
to the altar.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.407
Do you know by who?

21:49.409 --> 21:50.741
No.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.010
But I suspect you do.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.781
Some cad who can't
take responsibility.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.783
But she found julien.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.618
And maybe she's lucky.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.054
Her child will have a
name, respectability...

22:03.056 --> 22:04.355
She's in love with him.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.023
And if he's not

22:06.025 --> 22:07.491
In love with her...

22:07.493 --> 22:09.360
She can never be free of him.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.428
They're wed.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.896
She can protect her heart.

22:11.898 --> 22:15.366
And as her friend,
I want to help her do that.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.535
As my husband,

22:17.537 --> 22:19.804
I want you to help me.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.606
Please?

22:25.977 --> 22:27.912
(footsteps approaching)

22:27.914 --> 22:31.048
You said you would
keep me apprised

22:31.050 --> 22:32.583
Before any serious
action was taken.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.085
I've spilled no blood.

22:34.087 --> 22:36.053
You kidnapped
the queen of France!

22:36.055 --> 22:37.655
And cut off her ear.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.390
You really are new at this,
aren't you?

22:39.392 --> 22:41.592
The queen is fine.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.561
I purchased the ear off
a grave-digger.

22:43.563 --> 22:47.398
And put catherine's earring on
it to better tell the tale.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.866
Besides,

22:48.868 --> 22:50.401
Your orders were
to get the money

22:50.403 --> 22:51.402
As quickly as possible.

22:51.404 --> 22:52.403
By stealing it.

22:52.405 --> 22:53.804
Not by ransoming her.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.072
The medicis are refusing to pay.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.540
I could have warned you
about that.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.942
The ransom is a distraction.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.543
What anyone would expect
in a kidnapping.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.679
And is it your intention
to kill the queen?

23:01.681 --> 23:03.948
Since she surely
suspects I'm responsible.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.683
Oh, she suspects all right.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.885
She's offered me double my fee
to bring her your head.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.455
Relax, mary.

23:11.457 --> 23:13.758
(laughs) I wouldn't
succeed in my line of work

23:13.760 --> 23:15.826
If it were known that I
could be turned so easily.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.496
I'm not going to
kill catherine.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.164
And you won't be blamed
for this.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.099
How do you intend
to pull that off?

23:22.101 --> 23:24.101
The queen has no way of proving
you're responsible.

23:24.103 --> 23:27.471
So all we need is
a credible alternative.

23:27.473 --> 23:29.640
Someone we can frame
for the crime.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.976
I'll deliver the
queen the head.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.711
She'll pay me,
and I'll give you the money.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.479
Minus my cut.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.581
The queen goes free,
and everyone's happy.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.484
Except for the innocent soul
who dies in my stead.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.719
If you're worried
about innocence,

23:41.721 --> 23:43.487
Then choose someone who isn't.

23:43.489 --> 23:45.489
Given all the treachery
and backstabbing at court,

23:45.491 --> 23:47.992
It shouldn't be that hard.
Pick a name.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.827
Someone this world would be
better off without.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.163
And don't waste time about it.

24:02.641 --> 24:03.707
You hired a mercenary

24:03.709 --> 24:04.975
To kidnap catherine?

24:04.977 --> 24:08.446
I didn't mean for it
to go that far, but yes.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.848
Now, to get out of it, I have to
pin the crime on someone else.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.117
You'd do that? You'd send
an innocent to their death?

24:13.119 --> 24:16.687
I don't know what I'm capable
of anymore, to be frank.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.123
But there is one possibility.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.725
For months I've been
trying to figure out

24:21.727 --> 24:23.093
Which of catherine's
men participated

24:23.095 --> 24:24.228
In the massacre of my countrymen

24:24.230 --> 24:25.930
At the brothel.

24:25.932 --> 24:28.666
Some time ago,
I paid a servant

24:28.668 --> 24:31.068
To track down one of the
prostitutes who escaped

24:31.070 --> 24:32.136
To find some descriptions

24:32.138 --> 24:33.804
Of the men involved.

24:33.806 --> 24:34.939
According to the prostitute,

24:34.941 --> 24:36.073
One of the men had a scar

24:36.075 --> 24:38.576
On his left cheek
from brow to chin.

24:38.578 --> 24:39.944
Lots of men have scars.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.078
He also badly burned his hands

24:41.080 --> 24:42.112
After the massacre.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.080
This isn't justice.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.081
It's solving your problems

24:44.083 --> 24:45.082
With the blood of another.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.250
I know how this goes.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.552
As do you.

24:48.554 --> 24:51.088
That's why you came to me.

24:52.591 --> 24:54.592
You killed someone in the woods

24:54.594 --> 24:58.562
When the pagans forced you
to choose a sacrifice.

24:58.564 --> 25:00.598
I did it for you.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.868
And for myself.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.270
I murdered a man who was
about to kill another.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.706
And to this day I wonder.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.608
Did he have a family?

25:10.610 --> 25:12.510
Did he die for his own beliefs?

25:12.512 --> 25:14.879
Or was he simply acting on
the orders of those above him?

25:14.881 --> 25:17.982
Was he really as guilty
as I thought at the time?

25:17.984 --> 25:19.183
And what's the answer?

25:19.185 --> 25:21.018
The answer is, you have
to be sure.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.721
Because if there's
any doubt in your mind,

25:23.723 --> 25:26.223
Your conscience won't
ever let you rest again.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.939
(indistinct whispering)

25:46.211 --> 25:47.811
Mary.

25:47.813 --> 25:51.015
What a talent you have
for sneaking up on people.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.316
Oh, I couldn't help
but notice you speaking

25:52.318 --> 25:53.751
With catherine's guard.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.019
You mean my guard.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.220
I lent catherine

25:56.222 --> 25:59.056
My men some time ago.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.558
Why do you ask?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.760
I, um, wanted to employ him

26:02.762 --> 26:04.228
To help me find catherine.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.163
(laughs) my dear.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.631
You need to be a
much better liar

26:07.633 --> 26:09.800
If you want anyone to
take you seriously.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.669
I wanted to question him.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.637
He did some work for catherine.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.673
And I'm curious
to the specifics.

26:15.675 --> 26:16.974
The whorehouse massacre.

26:16.976 --> 26:20.311
Don't act so surprised.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.079
My guards may have
served catherine,

26:22.081 --> 26:24.582
But they're loyal to me.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.985
Did she put you up to this?

26:27.987 --> 26:29.787
Who? Catherine?

26:29.789 --> 26:31.188
She's been trying to banish me

26:31.190 --> 26:32.189
From court for years.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.792
Afraid I'll steal her husband.

26:34.794 --> 26:38.195
She already assigned that
little harlot of hers,

26:38.197 --> 26:39.663
Beatrice, to spy on me.

26:39.665 --> 26:41.065
And now she's got
you doing it, too.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.201
You're trying to gauge
my involvement

26:44.203 --> 26:46.337
In the slaughter
of your countrymen.

26:46.339 --> 26:49.006
Well, I had nothing
to do with it.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.141
I loaned catherine those men

26:51.143 --> 26:53.811
Long before she
planned the incident.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.613
And if you intend
to say otherwise,

26:55.615 --> 26:57.881
I'll deal with you in
the same way as beatrice.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.084
Queen or not.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.719
Are you threatening me?

27:01.721 --> 27:03.621
Let's just say I can't
have either of you

27:03.623 --> 27:05.022
Bearing false witness to henry

27:05.024 --> 27:06.290
When he returns.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.291
If it means

27:07.293 --> 27:09.026
Stepping on an insect,

27:09.028 --> 27:11.028
A servant, a nothing

27:11.030 --> 27:13.030
To make my point clear,

27:13.032 --> 27:16.200
I don't mind getting the
heel of my shoe bloody.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.369
If I've read you wrong,

27:18.371 --> 27:21.372
I apologize.

27:21.374 --> 27:24.842
But catherine must be taught

27:24.844 --> 27:26.844
To stay out of my affairs.

27:26.846 --> 27:30.114
Assuming she makes it
back to the castle.

27:37.355 --> 27:39.223
I was about to send the servants
to look for you.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.724
Where have you been?

27:40.726 --> 27:42.126
Looking into julien's
background.

27:42.128 --> 27:43.394
Among other things.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.329
Is he destitute?
He was married before.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.364
Did he kill his wives?
I have no idea.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.667
But I did learn of
his activities closer to home.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.335
He's planning a hunting trip.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.837
Lola mentioned it.
With one horse

27:53.839 --> 27:55.339
And a carriage
to carry some belongings.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.808
But no hounds, no falcons.

27:57.810 --> 28:00.678
He didn't request
hunting gear of any kind.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.248
You said her dowry came through.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.083
Yes. It's in his possession.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.085
You think he's going
to leave her?

28:08.087 --> 28:09.687
I don't know.

28:09.689 --> 28:10.988
But he's leaving
the castle tonight.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.089
And I don't for a minute

28:12.091 --> 28:14.224
Think he's going hunting.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.707
Did you do as I asked?

28:30.975 --> 28:32.710
(gasps)

28:40.151 --> 28:42.186
I don't believe it.

28:42.188 --> 28:46.123
Did you cut off the head
of mary, queen of scots?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.791
No.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.426
I brought the head of the one

28:49.428 --> 28:51.395
Behind your kidnapping.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.429
As you asked.

28:52.431 --> 28:53.864
What? Not mary?

28:53.866 --> 28:55.332
Then who?

28:55.334 --> 28:57.735
Answer carefully.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.436
If you lie,

28:59.438 --> 29:01.939
I won't tell you
where to find the money.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.907
Someone who's hated you
for a long time.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.910
Who needed money
desperately.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.412
You'll find proof
of what I've said

29:08.414 --> 29:09.880
When you return to the castle.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.416
Now, where's the gold?

29:12.418 --> 29:14.952
(grunts)

29:14.954 --> 29:18.422
If you lie, I'll find you again.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.824
And next time
I'll take your children as well.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.427
There's a chest of gold

29:23.429 --> 29:25.429
In an empty sarcophagus,

29:25.431 --> 29:28.365
Beneath the apse
of the church of st. Isabelle.

29:48.453 --> 29:52.389
Hortensa.

29:59.397 --> 30:01.198
Be fast.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.000
Don't miss.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.805
(all yelling)

30:07.807 --> 30:10.174
Sir, they're advancing!

30:31.830 --> 30:34.598
God save us all.

30:48.279 --> 30:49.913
(all cheering, whooping)

30:56.054 --> 30:57.387
(laughter)

30:57.389 --> 30:59.189
Well done, men!
All of you!

30:59.191 --> 31:01.859
Where's leith?

31:01.861 --> 31:04.862
He was behind me.

31:04.864 --> 31:05.863
Leith!

31:12.604 --> 31:15.205
A carriage but no hounds
for a hunting trip?

31:15.207 --> 31:16.306
Isn't that odd?

31:16.308 --> 31:17.574
Bash found his lack of interest

31:17.576 --> 31:19.409
In hunting supplies
quite odd, yes.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.278
Oh, he's going to leave me.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.280
If you love julien,
you should talk to him.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.882
See if he will share
his troubles.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.416
And pray that they're
just financial.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.619
(door opens)

31:28.621 --> 31:30.554
I was just checking in
on your beautiful bride.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.623
Lola:
Thank you, kenna.

31:37.328 --> 31:38.962
Uh, no, darling, don't.

31:38.964 --> 31:40.564
Please.
I want to talk.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.566
What you need
is rest.

31:42.568 --> 31:43.901
And I'm going to sleep
in my quarters

31:43.903 --> 31:44.902
This evening so you get it.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.603
And the hunting trip?

31:46.605 --> 31:48.438
Are you still going on it?

31:48.440 --> 31:51.308
I may, yes,
if you're well.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.110
Don't.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.645
Please don't.

31:54.647 --> 31:56.113
Stay with me.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.581
All right.
Uh...

31:57.583 --> 32:00.450
But I may stop in court
for a hand of cards. Hmm?

32:00.452 --> 32:02.986
I'll have your dinner
sent to you.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.656
Julien, please hear me.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.059
I don't need
elaborate things,

32:09.061 --> 32:11.395
Anything that
you can't provide.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.363
I admit I-I went
into this marriage

32:13.365 --> 32:14.598
As a means of survival.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.099
But I never would have done that

32:16.101 --> 32:17.601
If I hadn't thought
I'd found someone

32:17.603 --> 32:19.336
I could
care for.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.605
And I do.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.373
I want you.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.243
And you can keep
me for much less

32:26.245 --> 32:29.079
Than you might imagine.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.547
I wish you could believe that.

32:33.618 --> 32:36.019
Who could believe that
of a girl like you?

32:39.257 --> 32:41.024
You're everything
I ever dreamed of.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.370
Get back!

32:53.372 --> 32:54.972
I want every entrance
to the castle locked down

32:54.974 --> 32:56.406
Till further notice.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.642
Catherine.
Thank god.
Catherine:
You.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.410
You expect me to believe

33:00.412 --> 33:02.980
You know nothing of this?

33:02.982 --> 33:05.148
No, I swear.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.717
Organize a search
of hortensa's rooms

33:06.719 --> 33:08.185
And those of mary,
queen of scots.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.020
I want to know
everything about her:

33:10.022 --> 33:11.989
Her movements, her letters,
anyone she's been meeting with.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.524
Until I'm satisfied
with the details
of what happened,

33:14.526 --> 33:17.661
I will seek the identity
of my true abductor

33:17.663 --> 33:19.997
And destroy them.
Go!

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
(hawk screaming)
francis:
Leith!

33:22.001 --> 33:23.667
Leith?

33:23.669 --> 33:26.670
Over here!

33:26.672 --> 33:28.705
(groaning)

33:28.707 --> 33:30.574
He needs a physician.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.075
The nearest french encampment
is a few miles away.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.677
We'll go get help.
No, you must

33:33.679 --> 33:36.013
Join the others. We need as many
men as possible at the castle.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.081
See that they send a rider
to the duke of guise,

33:38.083 --> 33:39.182
Telling him
that the way is open,

33:39.184 --> 33:40.717
But it may not be for long.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.686
Hurry-- the war is all but won
if we press our advantage.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.554
You should
go as well.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.423
I'll be all right.
Shut up.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.558
You'll bleed out in the field
as our army passes by.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.726
I am not about to let you die.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.561
You're coming
with me.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.164
Oh, please.
No, I can't...

33:54.166 --> 33:56.566
(groans)
I can't make it.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.035
Please. Please.

34:01.172 --> 34:02.773
A wise man once told me--

34:02.775 --> 34:04.441
Yesterday, as a matter of fact--

34:04.443 --> 34:06.043
That we fight for
those that we love.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.444
I'm just like you.

34:07.446 --> 34:10.180
I want to go home.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.049
There must be someone that
you'll fight to see again.

34:14.519 --> 34:17.487
There's a woman.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.755
But it could never work.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.123
Is she married?
No.

34:20.125 --> 34:21.658
(coughs)

34:21.660 --> 34:23.126
Not yet, anyway.

34:23.128 --> 34:25.762
But she's above my station.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.364
Well, have you considered

34:27.366 --> 34:29.266
That maybe you have more
to offer her now?

34:29.268 --> 34:31.101
The friendship of
the next king of France.

34:31.103 --> 34:32.536
Do you know what
kings get to do?

34:32.538 --> 34:34.071
They get to give
lands and titles

34:34.073 --> 34:35.806
To those they wish to reward.

34:35.808 --> 34:38.075
It's one of the better aspects
of being king,

34:38.077 --> 34:39.810
Because, trust me, some of them
are far less enjoyable.

34:39.812 --> 34:41.611
You'd do that?

34:41.613 --> 34:42.746
For me?

34:42.748 --> 34:44.548
Why wouldn't I?

34:44.550 --> 34:46.817
Because you're merely
a chess piece?

34:46.819 --> 34:49.486
I have lost
good men,

34:49.488 --> 34:51.388
And I'm not prepared
to sacrifice any more,

34:51.390 --> 34:53.090
Especially if
I can help it.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.358
Live, leith bayard.
Live...

34:55.360 --> 34:57.694
And go home
to the woman you love.

34:57.696 --> 35:00.163
Marry her and be happy

35:00.165 --> 35:01.798
And live for as long
as you possibly can.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.166
But <i>live.</i>

35:09.774 --> 35:11.108

35:17.648 --> 35:20.784
(trumpet fanfare)

35:20.786 --> 35:22.452
Francis:

35:22.454 --> 35:24.154
The road to calais

Roman de medici,
your grace.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.437
(sighs)

36:16.307 --> 36:19.843
I supervised the search
of hortensa's room.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.878
Her jewel box was empty.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.181
Turns out she was penniless.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.882
How?

36:25.884 --> 36:27.717
I thought her husband left her
a fortune when he died.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.920
We found this
among her things.

36:29.922 --> 36:31.188
Bring it.

36:37.862 --> 36:41.198
Instructions on
the delivery of money?

36:41.200 --> 36:42.732
It would seem she was
being blackmailed.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.467
By someone who suspected

36:44.469 --> 36:45.902
She had arranged
her husband's death.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.270
(exhales)
and did she?

36:47.272 --> 36:48.638
You know hortensa.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.508
It's distinctly possible.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.410
According to
that letter,

36:53.412 --> 36:54.644
She had been paying vast sums

36:54.646 --> 36:56.513
For years to keep the secret.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.215
That's why she came here

36:58.217 --> 36:59.316
And held you for ransom.

37:01.686 --> 37:03.954
I'm sorry,
catherine.

37:03.956 --> 37:06.923
I don't know
how any of this
escaped our notice.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.559
For a moment, what I thought
had escaped my notice

37:09.561 --> 37:11.561
Was mary, queen of scots.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.796
(sighs)

37:12.798 --> 37:15.365
A child I'd raised for a while.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.934
I wondered what lessons
she'd learned from me lately.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.803
I warned her not to beg,

37:19.805 --> 37:21.638
Not to look weak.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.840
You think she
arranged all this?

37:25.776 --> 37:28.278
I think she's capable
of all of it,

37:28.280 --> 37:30.313
Except the murder of hortensa.

37:30.315 --> 37:31.982
It takes
time

37:31.984 --> 37:35.852
For a woman to grow that hard.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.921
I was nearly 30

37:37.923 --> 37:40.023
When I killed an innocent.

37:41.659 --> 37:44.327
I suppose innocence
is all relative.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.832
I wonder how long
mary's will last.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.735
Because once gone,
it can never be reclaimed.

37:55.673 --> 37:57.807
Lola:
Julien.
I didn't play cards.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.009
I was going
to leave you,

37:59.011 --> 38:00.877
And I suspect
you knew that.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.314
I've fallen out
with my family.

38:04.316 --> 38:05.582
They're not good people.

38:05.584 --> 38:06.850
I-I don't want to go into it

38:06.852 --> 38:08.885
Beyond that.
I only...

38:08.887 --> 38:12.355
I have no money of my own.

38:13.591 --> 38:15.425
I was going to live off yours.

38:15.427 --> 38:18.428
What I could get
my hands on, anyway.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.430
Your dowry.

38:20.432 --> 38:25.302
I am about as close
to penniless

38:25.304 --> 38:28.571
As a son of a wealthy family
could ever be.

38:28.573 --> 38:30.740
And is that why you married me?

38:30.742 --> 38:33.710
Why you didn't care about me
carrying another man's child?

38:33.712 --> 38:35.312
Because of my money?

38:35.314 --> 38:36.946
Yes.

38:37.915 --> 38:40.984
But as I came
to love you,

38:40.986 --> 38:43.753
I knew I couldn't
keep such a secret
from you any longer.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.389
The shame of
telling you the truth,

38:46.391 --> 38:48.458
Of admitting that our life
could only be funded

38:48.460 --> 38:50.060
By your family's money...

38:50.062 --> 38:51.461
What about my shame?

38:51.463 --> 38:53.897
Abandoned not one year
into our marriage.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.065
Did you think about that?

38:55.067 --> 38:57.467
I wasn't thinking clearly.

38:57.469 --> 39:00.770
You said you didn't
want to be alone,

39:00.772 --> 39:04.874
That fear made you want me
at your side.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.811
Well, my fear made me
want to run away.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.346
What are you
so afraid of?

39:09.348 --> 39:12.649
All I have to offer you...

39:12.651 --> 39:14.484
Is me.

39:14.486 --> 39:18.021
But I thought if you
meant what you said,

39:18.023 --> 39:19.756
If you needed less,

39:19.758 --> 39:21.491
If you could live
a simpler life...

39:21.493 --> 39:23.093
I could.

39:23.095 --> 39:25.362
I want to.

39:25.364 --> 39:26.563
I want to forgive you,

39:26.565 --> 39:28.565
I-I want to be with you,

39:28.567 --> 39:30.567
But how do I trust you?

39:31.702 --> 39:33.002
With time.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.940
With our
whole lives.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.008
I will prove myself to you.

39:40.511 --> 39:42.779
♪ it's all to come

39:42.781 --> 39:44.781
Promise me: No more lies.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.649
I promise.

39:46.651 --> 39:52.455
♪ for now we're still young.

39:56.093 --> 39:57.127
You came back.

39:57.129 --> 39:59.562
This is just a sample.

39:59.564 --> 40:02.732
The rest is hidden safely,
awaiting your instructions.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.000
Minus my cut, of course.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.568
And hortensa's body?

40:05.570 --> 40:06.970
Buried safely,

40:06.972 --> 40:08.171
With a forged letter

40:08.173 --> 40:09.706
Planted in
her chambers

40:09.708 --> 40:11.007
To convince catherine
of her guilt.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.575
I took her head quickly,

40:12.577 --> 40:13.977
If that brings
you peace.

40:13.979 --> 40:17.480
I'm not sure there is one
when it comes to murder.

40:17.482 --> 40:19.115
But I've been at
court long enough

40:19.117 --> 40:20.583
To know how
the medicis work,

40:20.585 --> 40:21.918
And how they act.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.853
Hortensa was going to have
beatrice killed.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.989
Her guard confirmed it.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.458
I traded one life
for another today.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.126
And I pray that
I've saved my mother.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.162
But at what price?
Count
yourself lucky

40:32.164 --> 40:33.997
It was bought so cheaply,
your grace.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.732
It's been
a pleasure

40:35.734 --> 40:37.000
Doing business with you.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.868
Actually,

40:38.870 --> 40:41.871
I'm not quite done
with your services yet,

40:41.873 --> 40:43.506
If you're
still willing.

40:43.508 --> 40:45.008
That gold you acquired
is bound for scotland,

40:45.010 --> 40:46.609
To help
my mother.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.078
I need to be sure it arrives
in the right hands.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.914
I need someone I can trust

40:50.916 --> 40:53.016
To lead a group of men
to secure her rescue.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.217
There would be
a substantial purse

40:54.219 --> 40:55.885
In it for you, as well,
of course.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.054
Finding men like myself,

40:58.056 --> 40:59.489
Willing to do
whatever's necessary

40:59.491 --> 41:01.224
In spite of the risks,
isn't easy.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.827
I've already taken
care of that part.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.995
Follow me.

41:08.699 --> 41:10.767
(men conversing indistinctly)

41:12.636 --> 41:14.771
These men used
to work for hortensa,

41:14.773 --> 41:16.172
Until their mistress
lost her head,

41:16.174 --> 41:17.774
And now they
work for me.

41:19.844 --> 41:21.978
And they
answer to you.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.246
Pack your
belongings.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.048
Be ready to sail
within the hour.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.250
Yes, your grace.

41:30.054 --> 41:31.521
John:
Are you sure

41:31.523 --> 41:33.122
You know what
you're doing?

41:33.124 --> 41:35.058
Those men are rumored
to have carried out

41:35.060 --> 41:36.726
The massacre of
your countrymen.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.728
They're monsters.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.797
Indeed they are...
But they're my monsters now.
