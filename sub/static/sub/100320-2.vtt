WEBVTT

00:07.572 --> 00:09.313
- I understand, but look,
forget the trial.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.533
It's too risky.
They have video of the robbery.

00:11.576 --> 00:13.535
- So what do you recommend?

00:13.578 --> 00:16.016
- Your son pleads guilty.
That's what Robbie's doing.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.409
- And I get to go home?

00:18.453 --> 00:21.238
- Up to the judge,
but it's a first offense.

00:21.282 --> 00:24.067
You're 16, gun was a toy,
no violence.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.808
I think we're looking
at a suspended sentence.

00:25.851 --> 00:28.419
- But there is a chance
he might go to jail?

00:28.463 --> 00:29.986
- Not likely.

00:31.814 --> 00:34.425
I know Judge Philpot.
This should be easy peasy.

00:39.909 --> 00:43.739
- Uh... we're going
to need a few days.

00:43.782 --> 00:46.655
- I spoke to the prosecutor.
This is a one day offer.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.223
I say we take it.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.182
You good with this, Kendall?

00:55.142 --> 00:57.666
- I guess.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.494
- I'll let the judge know.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.934
- Do the defendants waive
pre-sentence reports

01:04.977 --> 01:06.370
and stand ready for sentence?

01:06.414 --> 01:07.980
- Yes, Judge.
- Yes, Judge.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.504
- Very well.

01:09.547 --> 01:12.072
Mr. DeGrasso, you look like
you're from a good family.

01:12.115 --> 01:15.205
Because of your minimal
participation in this robbery,

01:15.249 --> 01:19.079
I sentence you
to five years probation.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.385
As for you, Mr. Tyson,

01:21.429 --> 01:23.257
since you displayed
the handgun--

01:23.300 --> 01:26.086
- Well, a toy gun, sir.
And we only took $32--

01:26.129 --> 01:27.739
- Your victims didn't know
it was a toy.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.480
They were in fear
for their lives.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.178
That's armed robbery,
as I'm sure your lawyer

01:31.221 --> 01:32.266
explained to you.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.919
- I did, Your Honor.

01:33.963 --> 01:37.488
- Since you took
the leading role, Mr. Tyson,

01:37.532 --> 01:40.143
I sentence you
to 20 years incarceration.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.666
- Did you say 20 years?

01:41.710 --> 01:44.147
- Yeah, that's right.
Sit down, ma'am.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.106
Counselors, advise your clients
of their right to appeal.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.238
- Wait, Your Honor, please,
just hold on one second.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.153
- Bailiff, take custody
of Mr. Tyson.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.242
- Mr. Buchman, Mr. Buchman.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.070
- Wait, Mom.
[whimpering]

01:54.114 --> 01:55.941
- Why don't you say something?
You're his lawyer.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.813
- It's the judge's call.
There's nothing I can do.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.162
- But you said
he wouldn't go to jail.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.250
- I never said that.

02:00.294 --> 02:01.469
- Mom.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.340
- Well, what do we do now?

02:03.384 --> 02:04.776
- You can appeal.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.865
Call my office; Rebecca
will give you some names.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.563
I have to be in Harrisburg.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.132
[door slams]

02:19.400 --> 02:21.097
- I need to see Mr. Buchman.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.359
- He's with a client.

02:22.403 --> 02:25.841
- My son is his client.
I need to see him now.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.190
- What the--

02:27.234 --> 02:30.280
- I have been calling you
and calling you.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.716
- Take it easy, Ms. Tyson--

02:31.760 --> 02:33.065
- Don't tell me
to take it easy.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.371
Why didn't you call me back?

02:34.415 --> 02:35.459
- I was going to--

02:35.503 --> 02:36.895
- Don't lie to me!

02:38.984 --> 02:41.465
You don't care about Kendall.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.075
We listened to you,

02:43.119 --> 02:46.035
and now he's going
to spend his life in jail.

02:46.078 --> 02:48.820
And you don't give a damn.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.213
- No, no.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.041
[both grunting, crying out]

02:52.084 --> 02:54.086
[body thuds, man groans]

02:56.045 --> 02:59.179
- [whimpering]
Oh.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.919
[gasping]
No, please.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.486
I didn't do anything.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.574
- Take your purse.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.272
Take your purse!

03:16.283 --> 03:20.243
- Jaden scraped both his elbows
when he fell.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.984
- You pushed him, Tali?

03:23.028 --> 03:24.595
Why?

03:24.639 --> 03:27.946
- He made fun of me on TikTok
because I don't have a mom.

03:27.990 --> 03:31.950
- Well,
there's your explanation.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.257
- Jaden was wrong
to do that, Tali.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.868
But that doesn't excuse
what you did, does it?

03:36.912 --> 03:39.784
I want you to decide
what punishment you deserve.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.133
You can tell me tomorrow.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.613
[phone rings]

03:42.657 --> 03:44.789
Excuse me.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.182
Yes?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.444
Uh, okay.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.011
I have to deal with this.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.274
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. LaCroix.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.710
- Thank you.

03:53.842 --> 03:57.324
[door opens and closes]

03:57.367 --> 03:59.239
- Jaden's a bully.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.502
I don't see why I have
to be punished at all.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.155
- I understand,

04:03.199 --> 04:04.722
but you can't let him goad you
into throwing the first punch.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.158
- Well, that was the only way

04:06.202 --> 04:08.770
I could get him
to stop teasing me.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.598
No one else is going
to stand up for me.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.818
- Tali, you got me,
you got Grandma, Grandpa.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.298
- You're never here.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.605
And Grandma and Grandpa, well,

04:17.648 --> 04:19.824
they probably think
TikTok is a clock.

04:19.868 --> 04:21.043
[school bell rings]

04:21.086 --> 04:23.306
- [scoffs]

04:23.350 --> 04:24.655
I'll pick you up
from school, yeah?

04:24.699 --> 04:25.787
- No.

04:25.830 --> 04:26.788
[cell phone chiming]

04:26.831 --> 04:29.443
- I love you.

04:29.486 --> 04:32.794
[ominous music]

04:32.837 --> 04:34.186
Agent LaCroix.

04:34.230 --> 04:37.277
- We have Denise Tyson, 37.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.104
Walked into
a public defender's office

04:39.148 --> 04:40.758
and started blasting away.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.934
Killed a client,
wounded the lawyer,

04:42.978 --> 04:44.980
took a hostage,
and drove off in their car.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.416
The field office
in Philadelphia

04:46.460 --> 04:47.765
is assisting
with the kidnapping.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.507
- No GPS tracking?
- No GPS in the car.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.640
And both phones,
Tyson's and the paralegal's,

04:52.683 --> 04:54.163
are both powered down.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.513
- What's the connection
between Tyson and the lawyer?

04:56.557 --> 04:59.211
- He repped her son, Kendall,
on a robbery beef.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.126
- Well, can't have gone well
if she shot the lawyer.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.345
Tell me more about her.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.521
- Single mom, one kid.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.001
Works as a stylist
at a hair salon,

05:06.044 --> 05:07.872
so mad skills
with disguises.

05:07.916 --> 05:11.746
- So she shoots up an office,
an act of explosive rage.

05:11.789 --> 05:14.183
She have a history?
- No prior conviction.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.316
But she was arrested
for attempted murder

05:16.359 --> 05:17.839
in Baltimore 15 years ago.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.188
- Attempted murder?

05:19.231 --> 05:20.668
Well, if at first
you don't succeed...

05:20.711 --> 05:22.539
- The grand jury
didn't indict her.

05:22.583 --> 05:25.063
The case was dismissed
and sealed.

05:25.107 --> 05:27.196
- Still, it's a tangled web.

05:27.239 --> 05:28.980
Hana, start with the coworkers.

05:29.024 --> 05:32.114
Clinton and Crosby, embed
with the kidnapping task force.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.421
Make sure the youngster doesn't
eat them out of their larder.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.031
- I'll do my best.

05:36.074 --> 05:39.251
- And tell them to keep their
fingers away from his mouth.

05:39.295 --> 05:42.603
- Now, there's three reasons
people take a hostage.

05:42.646 --> 05:45.997
Ransom, a human shield,

05:46.041 --> 05:49.174
or leverage
for a set of demands.

05:49.218 --> 05:52.047
Let's find out exactly
what Denise Tyson wants.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.355
- I don't get it.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.096
20 years for a 16-year-old?

05:58.140 --> 05:59.533
- I was as surprised
as you are.

05:59.576 --> 06:02.274
- Lawyers are supposed
to be prepared, not surprised.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.755
- It wasn't my decision.
The judge--

06:04.799 --> 06:06.409
- But Ms. Tyson
tried to kill you.

06:06.453 --> 06:07.671
Why do you think that is?

06:07.715 --> 06:10.108
- When you find her,
ask her.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.328
[scoffs]
I'm one of the good guys.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.590
People like Ms. Tyson,

06:13.634 --> 06:15.244
they don't appreciate
that I don't get rich

06:15.287 --> 06:16.593
off these
court-appointed cases.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.421
- You're a busy, good guy
with a heavy caseload.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.771
[phone buzzes]
- Understatement of the year.

06:20.815 --> 06:23.208
- Over here, Mr. Buchman.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.036
Is that what
this unappreciative woman

06:25.080 --> 06:27.648
complained about,
your lack of attention?

06:27.691 --> 06:30.302
- [scoffs]
I tried.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.956
But three calls a day?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.306
"What color tie
should Kendall wear in court?"

06:34.350 --> 06:36.091
"Have I read such
and such a case?"

06:36.134 --> 06:38.136
Endless conversations
with her pastor.

06:38.180 --> 06:41.139
- To save her only son
from prison?

06:41.183 --> 06:43.403
[phone buzzes]

06:45.883 --> 06:48.625
- [scoffs]
Go ahead, Mr. Buchman.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.192
Take the call.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.326
- If that was my child,

06:54.370 --> 06:56.024
I'd want to wipe that smirk
off his face.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.156
- If it was my child,
I wouldn't stop at the smirk.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.202
This guy can't do anything
for Denise Tyson.

07:00.245 --> 07:01.551
But the judge...

07:01.595 --> 07:03.684
- She could leverage him,
assuming she has a plan.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.773
Right now, she just seems
to be going on her gut.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.818
- Well, you heard the lawyer.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.124
She researched the cases,

07:09.167 --> 07:10.995
she enlisted the help
of her pastor.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.780
She might be angry
and desperate,

07:12.823 --> 07:15.826
but not necessarily impulsive.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.002
- Maybe we can get
through to her.

07:18.046 --> 07:20.483
- Throw her a lifeline.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.311
- What do you mean
reconsider the sentence?

07:22.354 --> 07:24.487
- Only for the purposes
of a news interview.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.184
You'll tell the reporter
you thought it over,

07:26.228 --> 07:27.664
and the sentence was too harsh.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.536
- And the interview will be
broadcast this evening.

07:29.579 --> 07:30.798
The hope is
to convince Ms. Tyson

07:30.841 --> 07:32.408
to release the hostage
and surrender.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.279
- Oh, convince her
by giving her what she wants?

07:34.323 --> 07:35.367
And then what?

07:35.411 --> 07:36.630
Every defendant
with a grievance

07:36.673 --> 07:37.848
will come back here
waving a gun?

07:37.892 --> 07:39.937
- You can reaffirm
your original sentence

07:39.981 --> 07:41.504
after Tyson's in custody.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.115
- No, this charade won't
do wonders for my integrity.

07:44.159 --> 07:46.640
- And sentencing a child
to 20 years does

07:46.683 --> 07:48.468
when the white kid
got probation?

07:48.511 --> 07:50.470
- Judge, there's precedent.

07:50.513 --> 07:53.298
People v. Maldonado.
A judge from New York

07:53.342 --> 07:55.475
held a phony hearing
to catch a perpetrator.

07:55.518 --> 07:56.650
- No, not in my courtroom.

07:56.693 --> 07:57.912
I'm not going
to be made the fool

07:57.955 --> 07:59.740
'cause you people
can't do your job.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.481
[phone ringing]

08:07.574 --> 08:10.533
- Your Honor,
answer the phone.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.143
Have Crosby initiate a trace.

08:12.187 --> 08:13.710
- I don't know Rebecca Zayas.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.233
It's the fourth time
she's called today.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.496
It's probably a wrong number.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.236
- Rebecca Zayas is
Tyson's hostage.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.890
- Oh.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.544
Then you answer it.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.372
- It's probably Tyson.

08:23.415 --> 08:24.895
She knows your voice.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.550
Be positive.
Keep her talking.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.073
And put it on speaker.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.035
- This is Judge Philpot.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.384
- This is Denise Tyson.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.299
You put my son,

08:37.342 --> 08:41.085
my 16-year-old boy
in jail for 20 years.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.827
I need you to take it back.
Please.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.437
- Ms. Tyson,
I know you're upset,

08:45.481 --> 08:47.570
but I can't just change
a legally imposed sentence.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.790
It's not in my legal purview
to do that.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.922
- You need to show me
some respect.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.098
I am telling you what to do.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.752
You want me to shoot
this woman?

08:55.796 --> 08:57.362
[foreboding music]

08:57.406 --> 09:00.757
- Ms. Tyson, this is Special
Agent Jess LaCroix of the FBI.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.367
