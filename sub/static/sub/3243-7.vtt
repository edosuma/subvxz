00:01.468 --> 00:04.470
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.471 --> 00:06.271
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.273 --> 00:09.475
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:12.644
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:12.646 --> 00:15.581
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:15.583 --> 00:17.383
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:17.385 --> 00:21.620
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:23.722
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:27.328 --> 00:29.061
<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...

00:29.063 --> 00:32.164
  We need to find and stop the
four horsemen of the apocalypse.

00:32.165 --> 00:35.334
                War, pestilence,
               famine and death.

00:35.336 --> 00:38.237
 If those four horsemen succeed
    in breaking their seals,

00:38.239 --> 00:39.538
    We can all kiss humanity
           good-bye.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.274
         What is this?
 Whether the baby's your son...

00:42.276 --> 00:44.610
        Or your brother,

00:44.612 --> 00:46.178
He's still family.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.147
I'm so sorry.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.784
        I hope you feel
       better soon, okay?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.220
              Tell me you didn't
             just heal that kid.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.557
       Hematoma that size should
      not just appear overnight.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.960
         You need to be admitted
                  to a hospital.

01:00.961 --> 01:03.362
What do you know about abaddon?
   I think they're connected
     to the next horseman.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.597
  They're the ones who drained
my bank account a few days ago.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.599
      Work with us to find
     the leader of abaddon,

01:07.601 --> 01:10.202
 And i promise we will get you
       what you're after.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.537
 Koa shape-shifted into a nurse

01:11.539 --> 01:12.738
   And stole mrs. Schiller's
         medical file.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.840
               She's gonna track
            down leland schiller

01:14.842 --> 01:17.076
    <i> And try to put a bullet</i>
          <i> in his head.</i>

01:17.078 --> 01:18.477
              The man: Where to?
3245 tucker road.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.186
        ¶ do you feel ¶

01:27.188 --> 01:30.222
      ¶ any better now? ¶

01:33.761 --> 01:35.761
        ¶ do you feel ¶

01:35.763 --> 01:39.398
      ¶ any better now? ¶

01:42.570 --> 01:46.238
  ¶ i'm trying to follow... ¶

01:46.240 --> 01:49.374
 That may be the worst disguise
        i've ever seen.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.546
      What can i tell you?

01:54.548 --> 01:56.548
  I just don't have the gift.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.717
     Not like you, anyway.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.357
                    Far cry from
                      hong kong.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.398
               Well, i hope it's
                 worth the trip.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.238
 Man (scrambled): <i> The system is</i>
       <i> no longer working.</i>

02:19.240 --> 02:20.772
      <i> The system is sick.</i>

02:20.774 --> 02:22.774
           Infected,

02:22.776 --> 02:24.443
           Polluted,

02:24.445 --> 02:25.911
          And corrupt.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.780
       In a way that can
      no longer be healed.

02:28.782 --> 02:32.918
  The system has been brought
         to its knees.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.787
  The infection is spreading.

02:35.789 --> 02:39.925
    There is only one course
         of treatment.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.594
      And the illness must
         be eradicated

02:42.596 --> 02:45.597
    By any means necessary.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.267
    No matter what the cost.

02:48.269 --> 02:52.804
       If the cure kills
     the patient, so be it.

02:52.806 --> 02:56.475
    Because today we reveal
          to the world

02:56.477 --> 02:58.810
   The true power of abaddon.

02:58.812 --> 03:03.682
    Today, we finally enjoy
  the sweet taste of revenge.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.750
       Leland schiller is
      out there somewhere

03:04.752 --> 03:05.918
    About to break his seal.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.620
Bottom line-- we're
running out of time.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.938
                 Alan: So let me
              get this straight.

03:25.940 --> 03:27.940
                You're angels of
                 the apocalypse,

03:27.942 --> 03:30.475
             Aka the messengers.

03:30.477 --> 03:33.478
             You got powers, you
            got invisible wings,

03:33.480 --> 03:34.947
            And you're trying to
              stop four horsemen

03:34.949 --> 03:36.815
           From breaking a bunch
              of prophetic seals

03:36.817 --> 03:39.518
            That lead to the end
            of the world, right?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.386
    Basically.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.924
                That is freaking
                        awesome.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.226
        What?

03:47.228 --> 03:49.628
              You guys are meant
              to save the world.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.264
You never cease to amaze me,
you know that?

03:52.266 --> 03:54.266
                  I'll take that
                as a compliment.

03:54.268 --> 03:57.269
       So how does the meteorite
             play into all this?

03:57.271 --> 03:58.604
             You know, it-it was
                 glowing red-hot

03:58.606 --> 03:59.905
               When you did your
             spirit-walk thingy.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.340
Yeah, i know.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.675
I think secretary of defense
richards is trying

04:03.677 --> 04:05.510
To use the military
to weaponize it.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.812
           And she's a horseman?

04:06.814 --> 04:07.813
                   Horselady.

04:07.815 --> 04:08.814
                    Horseperson.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.949
     A horseman.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.552
        You know, maybe
      the stone glows red

04:13.554 --> 04:14.820
Because
of her evil actions.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.555
                Like a messenger
                      mood ring?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.589
    Yeah, maybe.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.926
You sure you want
to do this?

04:21.795 --> 04:22.794
                         Yeah.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.296
            Just one last thing.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.932
                 You sure you're
                     not aliens?

04:30.337 --> 04:32.337
Abaddon's clock is ticking down,

04:32.339 --> 04:33.672
      And we can't stop it

04:33.674 --> 04:35.674
        Because koa ran off with
      leland schiller's address.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.042
Look, koa's
one of us now.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.543
                  Be nice if she
                  acted like it.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.879
   It doesn't matter whether
      we like koa or not.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.348
     If we don't get a lead
    on what leland's up to,

04:43.350 --> 04:45.350
              Another horseman's
         gonna break their seal.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.818
      Raul: If you ask me,
       it's a done deal.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.855
    I say we move on, and we set
our sights on the next horseman.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.457
    Hey, guys.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.459
  This is alan.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.795
   Alan, meet the messengers.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.739
I warned you not
to bring alan into this.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.474
You are putting him
in danger.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.959
               He is a brilliant
                      scientist,

05:10.960 --> 05:12.443
           He thinks fast on his
         feet, and to be honest,

05:12.446 --> 05:14.813
            He actually wants to
            be here, unlike koa.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.482
    And don't you think we could
        use an assist right now?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.751
    Maybe he could actually help
        us find leland schiller.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.421
        No, alan is not
      a part of this team.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.956
      And he's not a part
        of our destiny.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.893
       Well, maybe he has
     a destiny of his own.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.332
So let me guess
your gift.

05:33.334 --> 05:36.335
               Wait, wait, don't
                  tell me, um...

05:36.337 --> 05:37.502
                   Is it flying?

05:37.504 --> 05:38.503
                   Wait, no, no.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.339
                     V says that
                 nobody can fly.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.807
Yet everybody
has wings.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.975
Which is kind of
a waste.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.111
Do you talk
to animals?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.979
                Do i look like i
                talk to animals?

05:52.586 --> 05:54.052
        Okay, last time,
  you could name nine organs.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.587
   How many can you name now?

05:55.589 --> 05:57.923
              Hmm.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.124
         Brain, lungs,

05:59.126 --> 06:01.927
         Liver, kidney,

06:01.929 --> 06:03.061
      (cell phone rings)
                        heart...

06:03.063 --> 06:04.930
    Sorry, sweetie, hold on.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.698
             Hello?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.317
          Miss calder?

06:08.318 --> 06:09.935
       This is dr. Ashley
  from the haven house clinic.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.472
      We have the results
    of your echocardiogram.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.475
  Your hematoma is the result
    of pericardial effusion.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.943
Okay, and what is that exactly?

06:17.945 --> 06:19.878
    A bleeding of the heart.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.947
          Infection is
     the most common cause,

06:21.949 --> 06:23.915
       But we don't know
     what's causing yours.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.050
    If the fluid builds up,

06:25.052 --> 06:27.052
    The heart can suffocate.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.054
   I'll have the test results
      sent to your doctor.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.022
  Are you at the hospital now?

06:32.126 --> 06:34.025
   I'm sorry, i'm gonna have
       to call you back.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.894
            Thanks.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.829
     Everything okay, mom?

06:38.932 --> 06:41.633
       Yeah, everything's
         fine, sweetie.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.603
              You find anything?

06:44.605 --> 06:47.539
       No listed address
      for leland schiller.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.508
         So i'm trying
     to track down his mom.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.842
        Margaret, right?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.344
 You think they lived together?

06:52.345 --> 06:53.845
         Well, we know
that he was taking care of her.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.981
        So it's probably
    the best place to look.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.016
But check it out.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.619
All i got is
a margaret b. Schiller,

07:00.621 --> 07:02.020
    High school track star,

07:02.022 --> 07:04.990
  And a margaret k. Schiller,
       35, opera singer.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.559
Don't think either is
the one we're looking for.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.962
          Have you tried running
                 an image search

07:10.964 --> 07:12.998
           That cross-references
       her photo from the clinic

07:13.000 --> 07:15.033
With names and addresses
in the area?

07:16.136 --> 07:17.969
Yeah, i was just about
to do that.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.571
                     Okay, cool.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.908
Then maybe when
you're done with that,

07:22.910 --> 07:24.676
               You might want to
            take a look at this.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.646
Uh, what is it?

07:27.648 --> 07:30.015
   Remember when you told me you
don't know who your parents are?

07:30.984 --> 07:32.651
    Yeah, why?

07:32.653 --> 07:35.120
           Well, it wasn't easy,

07:35.122 --> 07:37.656
                But i might have
                     gone online

07:37.658 --> 07:39.991
            And hacked a copy of
             your birth records.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.626
    You did what?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.094
               Listen, it's none
                 of my business,

07:43.096 --> 07:45.096
                   I didn't look
                   at any of it,

07:45.098 --> 07:48.233
I just thought it might help you
 figure out where you came from.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.936
                    Your family.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.004
        (computer beeps)

07:55.576 --> 07:56.942
               We got something.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.643
             Look.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.779
Two addresses matching
margaret schiller.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.114
One's a business pretty close,
the other is residential,

08:03.116 --> 08:06.117
Outside of town.
              Leland could be at
            either one of these.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.619
Okay, vera and joshua,
you're with me.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.753
We'll take
the business.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.138
                 Peter and raul,
             you take the house.

08:10.139 --> 08:11.522
        How much time on
 that clock before it runs out?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.027
          47 minutes.

08:17.865 --> 08:18.864
       (knocks on door)
raul: Hey.
                            Hey.

08:18.866 --> 08:19.865
We've got a lead.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.099
     Okay, great. Let's go.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.968
No, no, i mean, um...

08:22.970 --> 08:24.102
We've got this one.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.504
                 What?

08:25.506 --> 08:26.771
Why don't you just
stay home with amy?

08:26.773 --> 08:28.006
How else is she gonna win
that nobel prize?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.007
        Raul, i'm fine.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.008
       Mom's all better.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.109
        She told me so.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.611
              See?

08:34.847 --> 08:35.847
You need rest.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.049
            I'm sick of resting.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.751
Erin, listen to me.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.754
This is a tricky gift
you've got.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.123
I mean, why take the risks
if you don't have to?

08:45.125 --> 08:47.092
           Because i do have to.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.095
              Come on, let's go.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.030
Amy, nadia's
in the kitchen.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.031
I'll be back soon,
okay?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.099
                      Okay, mom.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.270
      No, i'm sorry, vera,
  but he's not coming with us.

08:58.272 --> 08:59.621
I'm sorry, rose,
but he is.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.971
          Look, i don't want
          to argue with you.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.040
                  Hey, guys, i'm
                     right here.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.041
                    Talk to me--
             what's the problem?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.109
       (tires screeching)

09:07.948 --> 09:09.814
                 Whoa, who's the
                    train wreck?

09:13.787 --> 09:15.020
            My wife.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.324
(groans)
joshua.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.325
       It's okay.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.593
Please help me.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.109
How the hell did you
find me, charlotte?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.311
  Your father hired some private
    detective to track you down.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.348
    And i answered the call
      when he got a lead.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.350
I came here
to get away from you.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.751
So what do you want?

09:48.055 --> 09:50.055
     To get away from him.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.690
       Your father is...

09:53.894 --> 09:56.761
 I just can't take it anymore.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.715
      You're using again?

10:23.090 --> 10:26.091
       Everybody parties
       in college, right?

10:27.728 --> 10:31.730
I thought i was like
everybody else.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.332
But it felt like they all knew
one thing i didn't.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.267
          How to stop.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.636
             So...

10:37.638 --> 10:39.704
That's why i'm here.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.077
Thank you for sharing
your story, charlotte.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.145
We all need somebody

10:47.147 --> 10:48.246
             To watch our backs.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.348
   So let's pair up, people.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.766
              Hi.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.335
    Looks like you could use
            a buddy.

11:13.807 --> 11:17.242
    You can't be doing this.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.443
It's not just your life anymore.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.011
     It's the baby's, too.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.212
        Why do you care?

11:21.214 --> 11:22.847
      It's not even yours.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.101
                       Trust me,

11:26.102 --> 11:28.019
    Your father made me get
 a dna test, just to make sure.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.788
Of course he did.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.257
 He wanted me to give him sole
  custody of the baby, joshua.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.292
          And i was so disgusted

11:34.294 --> 11:36.361
   With myself that i agreed.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.198
      And then i realized,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.233
  I just can't keep giving him
         what he wants.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.771
    And that made him angry.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.188
      You stay right here.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.456
          Understand?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.328
       (bird screeching)

12:12.199 --> 12:13.865
                 Rose?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.233
             We've seen this, on
          the van the other day.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.685
          It's leland's company.

12:16.686 --> 12:18.136
            It doesn't look like
    anyone's been here in years.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.238
     I mean, why would they
        just lock it up

12:20.240 --> 12:21.906
    And abandon everything?

12:21.908 --> 12:23.842
  His mother's sick. Leland's
     a full-time caregiver.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.511
 He probably doesn't have time
      to run the business.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.079
              (pounding on door)
                          hello?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.698
   Hey, what if someone answers?

12:29.699 --> 12:31.316
Then we ask them
if they've seen a horseman.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.517
 That's not how it works, alan.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.221
        Hey, this place
      may look abandoned,

12:36.223 --> 12:37.322
         But something
      inside's definitely

12:37.324 --> 12:39.091
    Pulling down some juice.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.859
Guys, we have to get
a closer look.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.360
No, tell me you're not gonna do
    your spirit-walk thingy.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.363
If it's between throwing
the brick or dying,

12:45.365 --> 12:47.232
I'm throwing the brick.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.409
             Whoa.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.845
           I guess we know where
          all the power's going.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.480
  Not exactly exterminator gear.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.250
   No kidding; these are some
 bad ass, high-end mainframes.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.218
  They generate serious heat.
     Got to keep them cool.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.487
I think we could be looking
at abaddon central.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.524
Leland's hacker network could
be controlled from right here.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.058
   This all looks automated.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.161
 I bet he controls it remotely.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.395
   But if leland's not here,
            then...

13:17.397 --> 13:18.997
     He could be anywhere.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.801
                        The man:
                    Here we are.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.004
               You sure you want

13:26.006 --> 13:27.438
                 To go in there?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.307
It doesn't look

13:29.309 --> 13:30.942
         Too friendly.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.510
 I'm not here to make friends.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.312
   I'm here to get my money.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.346
  Is money all you care about?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.081
      What else is there?

13:37.083 --> 13:39.184
       If he's defrauded
        all those banks,

13:39.186 --> 13:42.921
  He may be worth more to you
        alive then dead.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.290
                  A little mercy

13:45.292 --> 13:48.092
     Could sweeten the pot.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.327
           No mercy.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.995
     It's time for payback.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.997
             Okay, but remember,

13:52.999 --> 13:56.167
   Pride goeth before a fall.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.162
              ¶ ¶

14:50.590 --> 14:52.657
              ¶ ¶

15:12.512 --> 15:14.512
     Honey, i'm so thirsty.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.286
                           Vera:
               Getting anything?

15:21.287 --> 15:23.021
    All i can do is bring up
          a directory,

15:23.023 --> 15:25.023
But not even the nsa
could crack this encryption.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.524
          Maybe i can.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.466
                  We were right.

15:35.468 --> 15:39.203
     He's going after every
 nero hospital in the country.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.271
          To do what?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.040
          Crash their
     life support systems.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.241
He's gonna kill

15:43.243 --> 15:45.076
       All those people?

15:45.078 --> 15:48.579
  That's how leland schiller's
     gonna break his seal.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.418
              Mm.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.653
      Just what i needed.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.255
              Thank you, leland.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.023
    Sugar and lemon, right?

15:59.025 --> 16:00.658
    You know how i like it.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.961
               But you know what
                   i don't like?

16:02.963 --> 16:03.995
             What?

16:03.997 --> 16:05.630
                That you've been
                 stealing money.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.132
 I didn't raise you like that,
             did i?

16:08.134 --> 16:11.002
           No, ma'am.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.603
          You did not.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.605
 So, what are you going to do?
Take what i stole

16:14.607 --> 16:16.541
       And give it back.

16:16.543 --> 16:20.111
  Yes, you are, and i'm going
   to make sure that you do.

16:20.113 --> 16:23.581
               But first, i want
               you to show me...

16:24.517 --> 16:25.583
            (groans)

16:25.585 --> 16:28.052
   Everything all right, mom?

16:28.054 --> 16:29.120
                             Oh.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.355
         I feel dizzy.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.025
            The tea.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.160
        Lemon and sugar.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.295
Mom.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.396
                    Just the way

16:38.398 --> 16:39.564
          You hate it.

16:41.134 --> 16:44.102
     Have always hated it,

16:44.104 --> 16:46.537
     But at least it masked
         the sedative.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.438
        You drugged me?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.007
            Why did you do that?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.017
 Because you're not my mother.

17:04.424 --> 17:08.291
          (muttering)

17:08.294 --> 17:10.595
          I know what you did to
         charlotte, you bastard.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.330
  You're beating her just like
      you used to beat me?

17:13.333 --> 17:14.565
       Well, not anymore.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.532
                   You leave her

17:15.535 --> 17:17.502
                 The hell alone.

17:17.503 --> 17:20.538
Who are you to march in here
and threaten me?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.540
                       Your son.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.775
       The one who knows
       all your secrets.

17:23.777 --> 17:26.711
         The only thing
     i'm ashamed of is you.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.313
And i thank god

17:29.315 --> 17:31.382
  I'm gonna have another son.
     You're so full of yourself.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.352
       You don't even see
 how this is gonna destroy you.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.354
           (chuckles)

17:36.356 --> 17:38.256
         That dna test
    you made charlotte take?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.591
               As soon as i make
                    that public,

17:40.593 --> 17:44.529
      You and this church
         are finished.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.800
  I'm not afraid of you, boy.

17:48.802 --> 17:51.069
      Well, you should be.

17:53.807 --> 17:55.606
             Erin:
           <i> Vera says</i>

17:55.608 --> 17:57.675
They found abaddon's computers
but no leland.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.710
They're trying to shut
the machines down.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.580
(sighs)

18:02.582 --> 18:03.648
           You okay?

18:03.650 --> 18:04.849
Yeah, i'm fine.
It's just...

18:04.851 --> 18:06.551
It's just the heat.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.086
       How much further?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.354
      We're almost there.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.090
  Peter, what's the clock at?

18:13.827 --> 18:15.593
                          Peter!

18:16.529 --> 18:18.096
             Um...

18:19.265 --> 18:20.431
            (sighs)

18:20.433 --> 18:21.599
   Five minutes and counting.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.606
       What the hell kind
    of private investigator

18:28.608 --> 18:30.341
Are you, anyway?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.176
       I beg your pardon?

18:32.178 --> 18:34.612
You gave my daughter-in-law
privileged information

18:34.614 --> 18:35.880
On my son's whereabouts.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.216
That was meant for my eyes only.
                   My apologies.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.817
I-i thought she was in on this.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.653
     Of course i'll provide
   full refund of your fees.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.155
      Damn right you will.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.224
  Not to mention the address.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.292
             Sure.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.765
       Whatever you say.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.555
      What have you done?

19:17.557 --> 19:20.258
      I ask the questions.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.160
         How'd you pull
     that trick back there?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.828
       What the hell kind
      of a freak are you?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.930
        I'm just someone
 whose bank account got hacked.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.799
 So just give me my money back,
          and i'll go.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.168
Money?

19:30.170 --> 19:32.403
            Please.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.339
    I am after so much more

19:35.341 --> 19:36.774
          Than money.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.743
   What's the countdown for?

19:38.745 --> 19:39.644
That's the launch

19:39.646 --> 19:41.379
      Of a computer virus

19:41.381 --> 19:43.714
    Authored by yours truly.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.583
I'm gonna take down

19:45.585 --> 19:46.717
          Nero health.

19:46.719 --> 19:47.718
       Hacking hospitals?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.470
       I'm bringing down

19:49.471 --> 19:51.221
         Every last one
 of their life support systems.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.357
        To kill people?

19:53.359 --> 19:55.660
Just like they killed my mother,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.962
But you clearly
didn't know that, did you?

19:57.964 --> 20:01.365
     Nero denied her care.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.634
           She was...

20:03.636 --> 20:05.536
            So sick.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.707
    I sat in their offices,

20:09.709 --> 20:12.810
  And i begged those bastards.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.947
            But no.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.382
 She's not covered, they said.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.720
     So i brought her home

20:22.722 --> 20:26.224
 And i took care of her myself.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.292
           I'm sorry.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.727
      You don't mean that.

20:29.729 --> 20:33.331
             I do.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.399
     I watched my dad die.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.771
      Then you would know

20:40.773 --> 20:43.874
     That pity won't bring
          my mom back.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.814
Nothing will.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.485
This clock,

20:54.487 --> 20:57.955
       It's ticking down
      to the exact moment

20:57.957 --> 21:00.858
       One year ago today
         when she died.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.961
When it hits zero,
i push

21:03.963 --> 21:05.329
          This button.

21:05.331 --> 21:08.699
     And i launch the virus
        from my servers.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.368
            Then...

21:10.370 --> 21:13.037
     It's time for payback.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.745
       We're getting down
       to the wire, guys.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.847
      No use. We're locked
       out from this end.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.883
Maybe we can just
unplug everything.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.652
   Wait... Stop! Stop! Stop!

21:27.654 --> 21:28.786
It's hardwired.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.887
        You want to get
       your wings fried?

21:29.889 --> 21:32.056
Hang on.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.894
          I got this.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.829
      Just a little trick
   i learned in junior high.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.731
 I spent the week in detention.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.900
                           Vera:
       Alan, what are you doing?

21:44.737 --> 21:46.704
        Making it rain.

21:49.442 --> 21:52.610
               (both exclaiming)

21:52.612 --> 21:53.944
                  The servers...
                   It's working!

22:02.755 --> 22:04.455
(screams)
          hell, yeah!

22:05.425 --> 22:06.457
You did it!

22:06.459 --> 22:08.025
             I can't believe it.
Oh, my god.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.806
         You did this.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.645
       You're not alone!
           You liar!

22:33.586 --> 22:37.021
    Now, you're gonna learn
      how i handle pests.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.030
            (gasps)

22:46.032 --> 22:48.099
           (coughing)

22:57.844 --> 22:59.910
        (engine starts)

23:03.416 --> 23:05.483
           (coughing)

23:07.620 --> 23:09.854
          Joshua sr.:
     <i> Good to see you again,</i>
           <i> charlotte.</i>

23:11.557 --> 23:13.724
         What the hell
      are you doing here?

23:13.726 --> 23:14.892
      We had an agreement.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.727
Come back to the church with me.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.829
That's where you belong
till that baby's born.
                             No.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.164
                        I won't.
Yes,

23:20.165 --> 23:21.498
           You will,
    you pill-popping whore.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.633
                             No.

23:22.635 --> 23:23.667
I don't care
if i have to drag you

23:23.669 --> 23:24.835
       Back there myself.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.804
              No!
            (grunts)

23:26.806 --> 23:27.905
                      (grunting)

23:43.055 --> 23:45.689
      Charlotte, i'm back.

23:45.691 --> 23:48.793
          You hungry?

23:48.795 --> 23:50.861
          Hey, you...

23:51.964 --> 23:53.564
                      Charlotte!

23:53.566 --> 23:55.065
           Oh, my god! Hey! Hey!

23:55.067 --> 23:57.735
                Can you hear me?
                      Charlotte?

24:09.649 --> 24:11.782
No sign of koa or anyone.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.984
         Is it a fire?

24:12.985 --> 24:14.185
       I don't think so.
      It smells chemical.

24:14.187 --> 24:16.220
That's not good.
  There might be another way in.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.489
You two, circle around that way.

24:18.491 --> 24:19.757
 I'm gonna meet you in the back.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.062
She's in here!

24:37.710 --> 24:39.777
           (coughing)

24:48.955 --> 24:51.155
            (grunts)

24:59.665 --> 25:00.965
                     Erin: Raul!

25:00.967 --> 25:02.800
                          Peter:
                     Stand back!

25:11.110 --> 25:12.042
         Okay, come on.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.211
               Hey.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.880
                           Raul?

25:15.882 --> 25:16.981
           (coughing)

25:21.254 --> 25:23.954
Oh, come on, i got you.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.542
                  We have to get
                her to a doctor.

25:28.543 --> 25:30.293
There's not enough time. She'll
be dead before we get there.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.196
         We got to do something.
      I have to heal her.

25:41.274 --> 25:42.306
           (coughing)

25:42.308 --> 25:44.575
You're okay, you're okay.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.846
         What happened?

25:51.717 --> 25:53.017
      I'm okay. I'm good.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.954
                   Oh, no. Erin!

25:56.956 --> 25:58.722
Erin, wake up!

26:00.993 --> 26:03.227
             Vera:
          <i> Wait, guys.</i>

26:03.229 --> 26:04.328
         Did we really
     just stop a horseman?

26:04.330 --> 26:05.863
     I mean, does this mean
        that it's over?

26:05.865 --> 26:07.898
         I don't know.
      I mean, i think so.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.067
           (laughter)
      (cell phone ringing)

26:10.069 --> 26:11.302
                         My god!

26:11.304 --> 26:12.703
It's peter.

26:12.705 --> 26:15.573
   Peter, i think we just...

26:15.575 --> 26:16.874
         (short laugh)

26:16.876 --> 26:17.908
          What?

26:22.748 --> 26:25.115
Sorry, sir, but you'll have
to wait outside.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.917
             I don't understand.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.986
           What happened to her?

26:31.891 --> 26:34.224
You're what happened to her.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.795
You were dying back there.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.730
Erin healed you.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.732
She saved your life.

26:41.734 --> 26:42.800
           Then why is she sick?

26:42.802 --> 26:45.936
'cause our gifts
come with a price.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.823
         What the hell
      are you doing here?

27:05.825 --> 27:07.825
I heard there was an accident.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.893
Now, just tell me what happened.

27:09.895 --> 27:10.961
         She fell, hit her head.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.062
                    I found her.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.966
         Wait, how did you hear?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.067
Is she conscious?

27:17.069 --> 27:18.936
Has she said anything?

27:21.173 --> 27:23.073
                     Oh, my god.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.811
                     It was you.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.048
Let me go, damn it!

27:31.050 --> 27:32.716
            Doctor:
           Gentlemen?

27:32.718 --> 27:34.084
      Do we have a problem here?

27:34.920 --> 27:37.054
          How is she?

27:37.056 --> 27:39.957
Your wife suffered a concussion.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.393
   There is some brain swelling,
                but it is minor.

27:42.395 --> 27:43.761
              We're still trying

27:43.763 --> 27:45.262
                To stabilize the
         condition of the child.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.331
     But there's something else.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.766
               Defensive wounds.

27:48.768 --> 27:49.833
                Some very fresh.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.002
             I have to ask you--

27:52.004 --> 27:53.337
  Has this woman been assaulted?

27:53.339 --> 27:54.938
                 Yes.

27:54.940 --> 27:57.975
                         By him.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.055
      (indistinct chatter)

28:13.125 --> 28:15.159
How's she doing?

28:15.161 --> 28:17.795
    She's still in surgery.

28:17.797 --> 28:18.862
         It's been over an hour.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.064
        But there's no word
        from the doctors.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.399
It's gonna be okay.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.400
You need anything?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.469
                   No.

28:28.974 --> 28:31.275
         (siren wails)

28:31.277 --> 28:34.311
     (reporters clamoring)

28:55.434 --> 28:57.434
     Vera, leland schiller?

28:57.436 --> 28:59.470
           He's here.

28:59.472 --> 29:00.971
         The horseman?
   I thought we stopped him.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.706
          It doesn't make sense.

29:02.707 --> 29:04.440
If he can't hack the entire
network from outside...

29:04.443 --> 29:06.777
   He could still hit one of the
      hospitals from the inside.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.378
         Look, we have
     to find him, come on.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.663
               Raul?

29:09.664 --> 29:10.947
   I got to stay here with erin.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.050
         I know. Peter?
           Let's go.

29:13.052 --> 29:15.018
      What about you, koa?

29:16.088 --> 29:18.122
          I'm all in.
             Okay.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.928
Look at the size of this place.
Schiller could be anywhere.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.264
How the hell are
we supposed to find him?
                   I don't know.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.900
  Wait, wait. The genesis stone.

29:29.902 --> 29:30.934
The what?

29:30.936 --> 29:31.969
                  The meteorite.
              It was glowing red

29:31.971 --> 29:33.904
        When i was around
        the last horseman.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.273
      Maybe it can help us
       find the next one.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.809
            Come on!

29:45.117 --> 29:46.383
             Rose:
             Okay.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.519
    You take this corridor.
       I'll go that way.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.892
          Looking for something?

29:56.162 --> 29:57.961
What do you want?

29:57.963 --> 30:00.063
     Good to see you, too, rose.

30:00.065 --> 30:03.133
                I've come to beg
               your forgiveness.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.301
For what?
                      We got off

30:04.303 --> 30:05.803
              On the wrong foot.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.972
     I tried to have you killed.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.140
       I can be a bit impulsive,
      occasionally shortsighted.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.408
                          Sorry.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.243
                         My bad.
You don't give a damn

30:13.245 --> 30:16.146
About being forgiven.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.015
So, why are you really here?

30:19.151 --> 30:21.051
          To make a proposition.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.154
      Why don't we work together

30:24.156 --> 30:25.989
                   For a change?

30:25.991 --> 30:28.592
Are you kidding?

30:28.594 --> 30:31.495
We're stronger than you.

30:31.497 --> 30:35.132
And you and i both know
you can't stop us.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.534
So, get the hell out of my way!

30:54.153 --> 30:56.320
             Vera:
            Leland!

30:56.322 --> 30:57.387
         Leland, stop!

30:57.389 --> 30:58.622
Stop! Look.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.190
I-i know you don't know
who i am.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.558
I'm begging you,
i'm begging you,

31:01.560 --> 31:03.126
Please don't do this.

31:03.128 --> 31:06.563
              Whoever you are...
                You're too late.

31:06.565 --> 31:07.965
              No.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.199
             No one

31:09.201 --> 31:11.435
        Can stop me now!
        That's not true!

31:11.437 --> 31:13.570
            You can.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.372
                And why the hell
                would i do that?

31:15.374 --> 31:17.040
       Because deep down

31:17.042 --> 31:19.409
You know this is wrong.

31:19.411 --> 31:23.180
You know it's wrong
to kill innocent people.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.515
                But who among us

31:25.517 --> 31:28.118
       Is truly innocent?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.287
          Who are you?

31:30.289 --> 31:32.189
   An admirer of your work--
   all the things you've done

31:32.191 --> 31:33.924
       And all the things
        you're gonna do.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.559
        Come on, leland,
       press the button.
Don't!

31:35.561 --> 31:37.060
        If you do this,

31:37.062 --> 31:39.296
     You can never go back.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.099
   You will become something

31:42.101 --> 31:43.166
More horrible

31:43.168 --> 31:45.202
Than you could ever
possibly imagine.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.470
       Shut the hell up.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.283
Leland, leland,
don't pay attention to him.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.220
You don't have to do this.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.055
         Nero health...

32:05.057 --> 32:08.325
      Murdered my mother.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.626
            I know.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.929
       They have to pay.
Okay, i know.

32:11.931 --> 32:14.231
    I know, but not through
  the lives of their patients.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.703
     I watched my mother...

32:19.705 --> 32:22.406
         Suffer and die

32:22.408 --> 32:25.208
 So that some insurance company

32:25.210 --> 32:27.277
         Could increase
       its profit margin.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.212
            I know.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.649
       They abandoned us.
The man:
Yes.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.685
              Yes.

32:34.687 --> 32:37.654
I was abandoned once.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.356
      Cast aside by those
      who should've cared,

32:39.358 --> 32:40.958
                  But i stood up
                and fought back.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.527
And you can do the same, leland.

32:43.529 --> 32:44.695
      Do you know what it's like

32:44.697 --> 32:46.163
        To lose someone?

32:47.366 --> 32:49.633
   To have them just snatched
         away from you?

32:49.635 --> 32:51.501
              Yes.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.303
           Yes, i do.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.372
You're a son

32:55.374 --> 32:57.341
Who lost his mother.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.545
 I'm a mother who lost her son.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.046
            I know.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.349
     They deserve to suffer
   just like your mother did.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.284
No, they don't!
Don't inflict her pain

33:07.286 --> 33:08.719
On anybody else.
Do it.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.253
No, leland, don't.
                   Do it.

33:10.255 --> 33:11.221
Your mother would never
have wanted this.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.622
Don't.
          Do it for your mother.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.691
Don't.
            (crying)

33:18.697 --> 33:21.498
    For your mother, leland,
         don't do this.

33:29.274 --> 33:30.640
           (beeping)

33:35.280 --> 33:37.347
       (crying continues)

33:42.287 --> 33:44.354
   (machine beeping steadily)

33:46.158 --> 33:47.290
              Hey.

33:47.292 --> 33:49.259
              Hi.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.595
        Josh, the baby.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.263
Shh, the baby's fine.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.465
            (sighs)

33:56.435 --> 33:58.235
          So are you.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.205
           I promise.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.610
         I'm so sorry.

34:10.282 --> 34:13.083
        For everything.

34:13.085 --> 34:15.152
           It's okay.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.690
   I forgive you, charlotte.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.563
            The doctor said that
           everything went well,

34:26.565 --> 34:29.331
                 And that we can
            check you out today.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.766
              But you need rest.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.202
         That's doctor's orders.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.304
            (sighs)

34:34.306 --> 34:35.371
        You were right.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.409
         I just thought
      i could keep going.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.415
              You won't have to.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.083
                         We won.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.418
        (chuckles) what?

34:49.521 --> 34:51.221
                 Leland schiller
               turned himself in

34:51.223 --> 34:53.090
    To the police two hours ago.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.690
                           Erin.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.327
             We stopped him from
                breaking a seal.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.496
       So it's over then?

35:01.233 --> 35:04.134
         No more seals,
      no more apocalypse?

35:04.136 --> 35:07.204
        Looks like we all get to
           make other plans now.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.543
    (country music playing)

35:27.459 --> 35:29.493
              Mom!

35:29.495 --> 35:31.394
     (song ends, applause)

35:31.396 --> 35:33.597
                     Bandleader:
    We'll be back in 15 minutes.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.182
     We really did it, huh?

35:52.184 --> 35:53.383
       It looks that way.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.352
 I mean, what-what happens now?

35:55.354 --> 35:57.487
       Do we, do we keep
        our gifts or...

35:57.489 --> 35:58.688
     Do we keep any of it?

35:58.690 --> 35:59.823
I don't know.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.424
     I'm guessing our gifts
           will fade,

36:01.426 --> 36:04.394
  But i think the friendships
    are gonna last a while.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.704
You're a real pain in the ass,
you know that?

36:15.641 --> 36:16.773
Oh, well.

36:16.775 --> 36:18.842
Here's to the messengers.

36:26.618 --> 36:27.784
                            Hey.

36:27.786 --> 36:28.919
              Hey.

36:28.921 --> 36:31.321
     Come on, preacher man.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.490
        We stopped the horseman.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.492
   We beat the devil. I mean,
   you're probably gonna get

36:35.494 --> 36:37.561
    Some beachfront property
      in heaven for this.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.496
    I don't know about that.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.598
No, i think...

36:41.600 --> 36:44.367
     I think rose is right.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.436
   Being a messenger gave me
           a purpose,

36:46.438 --> 36:48.672
  And now that we're finished,

36:48.674 --> 36:50.640
What have i got?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.209
           No family,

36:52.211 --> 36:54.878
           No church.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.313
  I mean, don't get me wrong.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.248
      It's not like i want
       the world to end.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.552
           But i had
this direct connection with god.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.890
        Now that's over.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.927
What am i gonna do with myself?

37:11.897 --> 37:13.663
              Hey.

37:16.301 --> 37:19.236
          I know this
      is gonna sound crazy

37:19.238 --> 37:20.770
        Coming from me.

37:22.507 --> 37:25.609
      But whatever you do,

37:25.611 --> 37:27.677
       Don't lose faith.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.255
Make you a deal.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.624
             Yeah?
You play a good song,

37:40.626 --> 37:42.576
    And i'll dance with you.

37:42.577 --> 37:44.527
     Trust me, if there was
  some bob marley up in here,

37:44.529 --> 37:46.029
I would already be on the floor.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.497
Come on.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.032
You helped save the world today.

37:50.535 --> 37:51.868
 Yeah, i don't know about that.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.838
         The meteorite,
     it's still out there.

37:56.341 --> 37:58.541
        It's got powers
      we don't understand.

37:58.543 --> 38:00.477
  And even without a horseman,

38:00.479 --> 38:03.480
  What if the military manages
         to harness it?

38:05.917 --> 38:08.551
   We stopped the apocalypse,

38:08.553 --> 38:12.322
   But that doesn't mean evil
    is gone from the world.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.790
There's still plenty out there.

38:16.895 --> 38:21.031
          ¶ i'd walk ¶

38:21.033 --> 38:25.769
         ¶ for miles ¶

38:39.551 --> 38:40.550
            Mm-hmm.

38:40.552 --> 38:41.985
                     A big seal.

38:47.059 --> 38:49.025
So, you open that envelope yet?

38:49.027 --> 38:51.061
             Nope.

38:51.063 --> 38:53.797
    I appreciate it, really.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.099
But i kind of

38:56.101 --> 38:58.368
Got a new family now.

39:05.711 --> 39:08.878
    Yeah, i don't blame you.

39:10.549 --> 39:18.021
           ¶ heaven ¶

39:18.023 --> 39:24.761

39:32.404 --> 39:40.443
       ¶ oh, i don't want
       to go to heaven ¶

39:44.783 --> 39:47.450

39:47.452 --> 39:48.551
                          Guard:
                  Hey, schiller.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.686
         You made bail.

39:49.688 --> 39:50.987
       You're free to go.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.123
  What are you talking about?

39:53.125 --> 39:55.859
    Who posted bail for me?

39:55.861 --> 39:57.861
   Does it look like i care?

39:57.863 --> 40:00.597
¶ i don't want to go to heaven ¶
