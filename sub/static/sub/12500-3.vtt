WEBVTT

00:03.414 --> 00:08.106
Hereby bequeath all of my wealthy
and worldly possessions to...

00:08.108 --> 00:10.021
Denzel Jackson.

00:10.022 --> 00:12.122
Jackpot!

00:12.345 --> 00:16.295
Don't worry. I promise not to spend your
dead mama's fortune on anything frivolous.

00:16.296 --> 00:19.896
Woo! Jet pack, mother[Bleep]!

00:24.070 --> 00:25.350
<i>â™ª Brickleberry!</i>

00:25.351 --> 00:27.506
<i>â™ª Brickleberry!</i>

00:27.507 --> 00:29.367
Woo!

00:29.368 --> 00:31.048
_.

00:31.371 --> 00:34.251
I love you, Woody.

00:34.681 --> 00:36.608
Love you too, Malloy.

00:36.609 --> 00:39.908
I'll bet you'll be sweet forever.

00:39.909 --> 00:42.020
Ai! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:42.021 --> 00:44.122
Will you stop shooting at me?

00:44.123 --> 00:46.925
Oh, you are so old and cranky.

00:46.926 --> 00:48.860
Rangers, time for morning inspection...

00:48.861 --> 00:51.094
What the hell happened here?

00:51.095 --> 00:52.781
I organized your desk for you.

00:52.782 --> 00:56.702
What? Where's my expense reports
and the envelope full of petty cash?

00:56.703 --> 00:59.204
It's in the paper shredder. You
have to let go of the clutter.

00:59.205 --> 01:01.293
Oh, God damn it, Ethel.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.608
You shredded a picture
of my dead Mother?

01:03.609 --> 01:05.986
- Clutter.
- I was supposed to shred that.

01:05.987 --> 01:07.245
It's called "closure"!

01:07.246 --> 01:09.548
Sorry... sorry I'm late, Woody.

01:09.549 --> 01:11.850
Jesus, Williams, you are a slob!

01:11.851 --> 01:13.485
You look like a turd in a tie.

01:13.486 --> 01:16.132
And what is that stain
on your goddamn uniform?

01:16.133 --> 01:18.490
It's, uh... it's lasagna.

01:18.491 --> 01:21.491
Wait. No, bird shit.

01:22.746 --> 01:25.325
Woody, I had a little accident.

01:25.326 --> 01:28.467
Cunaman, you wrecked
your patrol car again?

01:28.468 --> 01:30.436
What is this, the
fourth time this month?

01:30.437 --> 01:33.339
It's not my fault. You
know I have that blind spot.

01:33.340 --> 01:34.640
That's your neck.

01:34.641 --> 01:38.378
Woody, all this screaming and
yelling is not good for morale.

01:38.379 --> 01:42.948
Ooh, Little Miss O.C.D.
thinks she can do my job!

01:42.949 --> 01:44.650
I could definitely do it.

01:44.651 --> 01:47.519
Yeah, well, this job's not
as easy as you are, Princess.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.355
Jeez, you're being a real dick today.

01:49.356 --> 01:51.600
You wanna see a real dick?

01:51.601 --> 01:54.415
Will you stop blowing
that [Bleep] rape whistle?

01:54.416 --> 01:56.868
You know what I mean!
You Rangers are a disgrace

01:56.869 --> 01:59.197
to those National Park
service-issued uniforms!

01:59.198 --> 02:02.560
Woody, you're stressed. I mean, isn't
Malloy supposed to be your therapy pet?

02:02.561 --> 02:04.503
Why don't you go snuggle
with him or something?

02:04.504 --> 02:05.973
He only gets that on his birthday,

02:05.974 --> 02:08.473
and I don't know or give a
shit when his birthday is.

02:08.475 --> 02:11.176
You people are all driving me nuts!

02:11.177 --> 02:13.011
I don't know which one of you is worse!

02:13.012 --> 02:14.986
- Well, I'm better than Connie.
- No, you're not.

02:14.987 --> 02:17.916
- Steve, you're way worse than me.
- Well, I'm better than all of you.

02:17.917 --> 02:22.897
- Really? Oh, really?
- Steve, you are an idiot.

02:24.624 --> 02:27.593
Shut up, shut up. Shut up! Enough!

02:27.594 --> 02:31.096
You're all no-good, worthless,
shit-for-brains, lazy...

02:31.097 --> 02:36.137
Hey, speaking of lazy,
where the hell is Denzel?

02:36.202 --> 02:38.270
What is that goddamn thing?

02:38.271 --> 02:42.007
What? I can't hear you
over this bad ass jet pack.

02:42.008 --> 02:43.442
Get it outta here!

02:43.443 --> 02:45.663
Oh, okay.

02:47.685 --> 02:48.896
Ow!

02:48.897 --> 02:51.617
My roof! My goddamn roof!

02:51.618 --> 02:54.014
Who's gonna pay for all this shit?

02:54.015 --> 02:58.815
I swear to God, you
guys'll be the death...

02:59.363 --> 03:02.603
And Woody had a stroke.

03:06.350 --> 03:09.613
- Uh, what happened?
- Woody, you had a mini-stroke.

03:09.614 --> 03:12.451
A mini-stroke is like a
regular stroke, but fun-sized.

03:12.452 --> 03:15.077
- Fun-sized?
- Whoa, let's not make light here, Woody.

03:15.078 --> 03:18.128
This is serious. Your blood pressure
is the highest I've ever seen.

03:18.129 --> 03:20.612
Let me just draw some blood.

03:20.613 --> 03:22.620
Mm. Oh, dear.

03:22.621 --> 03:24.842
You know this brings back
memories of that Bukkake film

03:24.843 --> 03:28.493
I did to pay for medical school.

03:28.494 --> 03:31.519
Woody, you must cut out every
bit of stress in your life

03:31.520 --> 03:33.583
or you're going to die, probably today.

03:33.584 --> 03:35.242
Die? What can I do, Doc?

03:35.243 --> 03:37.445
Well, do you own a therapy pet?

03:37.446 --> 03:39.004
Yeah, but he won't let me pet him.

03:39.005 --> 03:41.744
Well, then, Woody, I'm afraid
your only option is suicide.

03:41.745 --> 03:44.505
- Suicide?
- No.

03:44.509 --> 03:46.146
"Soothe-inside".

03:46.147 --> 03:48.414
It's a meditation class
they offer at the clinic.

03:48.415 --> 03:50.936
Do you think I'm some
kind of new age fairy

03:50.937 --> 03:54.978
that's gonna sit around in
Indian garb and chant, "om, om"?

03:54.979 --> 03:57.739
I would rather...

03:57.865 --> 03:59.635
Oh, darn, another mini-stroke.

03:59.636 --> 04:02.428
Woody, I'm sure you won't mind
if I get a few up-skirt shots

04:02.429 --> 04:06.869
for my private
collection. Say, "cheese".

04:08.066 --> 04:11.726
- Om.
- My God, this is gay.

04:12.269 --> 04:16.444
Hello, travelers. I'm
Astral, your new instructor.

04:16.445 --> 04:20.041
Hey, buddy, I'd like to position myself
in her lotus, you know what I mean?

04:20.041 --> 04:22.600
Okay, everyone, close your eyes,

04:22.601 --> 04:28.501
inhale a long, deep breath, and
imagine a calm, serene scene.

04:33.887 --> 04:37.307
- Oh!
- Up yours, cracker!

04:40.760 --> 04:42.560
No!

04:45.774 --> 04:49.554
Woody, calm down. Here, pet me.

04:49.709 --> 04:52.709
I'm kidding. Attack!

04:56.019 --> 04:58.770
I am gonna choke the
life outta all of you's!

04:58.771 --> 05:02.791
Can't bitch if you can't breathe!

05:05.217 --> 05:06.090
Oopsie.

05:06.091 --> 05:11.448
Woody, I have never seen
such a display of raw passion.

05:11.449 --> 05:14.140
I suggest a private session.

05:14.141 --> 05:18.115
I can help you channel that
rage and find inner peace.

05:18.116 --> 05:21.199
Okay, if it'll help me relax.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.177
Oh, my God! What happened here?

05:23.178 --> 05:28.040
It was a black guy. I
think he had a jet pack.

05:28.041 --> 05:30.827
Woody, I was driving and eating lasagna,

05:30.828 --> 05:33.909
and Connie crashed into me and
made me spill it all over myself.

05:33.910 --> 05:35.587
But Steve rammed me.

05:35.588 --> 05:38.434
A man rammed Connie? What
is this, bullshit day?

05:38.435 --> 05:42.383
- I didn't ram her!
- Yes, you did, you liar.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.124
Enough! Break it up, you two.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.891
It is a beautiful
morning, isn't it, Rangers?

05:46.892 --> 05:48.144
You're not gonna yell at us?

05:48.145 --> 05:50.806
No, my child. My anger has flown.

05:50.807 --> 05:55.070
It's true, I've been trying
to piss him off all morning.

05:55.071 --> 05:57.544
Cut it out, Denzel.
That thing's dangerous.

05:57.545 --> 06:00.272
Nah, getting between you and
a bag of cheetos is dangerous.

06:00.273 --> 06:01.359
This is fun.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.732
Attention, my friends.

06:02.733 --> 06:05.703
I'd like everyone to meet
the woman who saved my life,

06:05.704 --> 06:09.364
my harbinger of love,
peace, and inner healing.

06:09.365 --> 06:11.937
Say hello to the new love of my life.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.071
New love of your life?

06:13.072 --> 06:15.132
Hope you let that rubber fist down easy.

06:15.133 --> 06:18.175
Hello, sweet spirits. My name is Astral.

06:18.176 --> 06:20.892
- Of course it is.
- I have an announcement.

06:20.893 --> 06:23.868
I am taking a voluntary
leave of absence,

06:23.869 --> 06:27.232
and I am passing on my
executive duties to Ethel.

06:27.233 --> 06:28.266
Ethel?

06:28.267 --> 06:32.170
Woody, I am more than capable of...

06:32.171 --> 06:33.591
Great choice, Woody.

06:33.592 --> 06:36.475
The Park will be so much more
efficient, and I won't mini-stroke

06:36.476 --> 06:39.144
out because I can actually deal
with the pressures of the job.

06:39.145 --> 06:40.577
What? I can deal with it!

06:40.578 --> 06:42.512
I can deal with anything, you...

06:42.513 --> 06:44.516
Mind your Chakras, Woody.

06:44.517 --> 06:48.186
Don't stray from your cosmic pathway.

06:48.187 --> 06:53.647
Ah, this is the most relaxing
poop I have ever taken.

06:58.865 --> 07:01.099
Any chance you could
do that somewhere else?

07:01.100 --> 07:03.869
Astral says this spot
has the best energy.

07:03.870 --> 07:06.604
Malloy, I'm hoping
that we can be friends.

07:06.605 --> 07:07.946
[Bleep] Off, weirdo.

07:07.947 --> 07:09.294
- Malloy!
- Sorry.

07:09.295 --> 07:12.517
Please [Bleep] off, weirdo.

07:12.518 --> 07:14.627
I really like you, Malloy,

07:14.628 --> 07:18.525
and as a gesture of our new
friendship, I painted this for you.

07:18.526 --> 07:20.755
That looks like someone
took a shit on a canvas.

07:20.756 --> 07:22.440
Bingo, Malloy. You got a good eye.

07:22.441 --> 07:25.380
But this scat art isn't the
only new addition to our home.

07:25.381 --> 07:27.693
- Astral's moving in with us.
- What?

07:27.694 --> 07:30.415
Don't worry, you won't
even notice she's here.

07:30.416 --> 07:33.176
Ah, ah! Oh, boy!

07:35.000 --> 07:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:42.942 --> 07:46.422
Woo! Isn't... she... great?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.847
Guess what. She's a squirter.

07:48.848 --> 07:51.020
It's like going down on
a fire hydrant in Harlem.

07:51.021 --> 07:53.833
She could break up a
riot with that thing.

07:53.834 --> 07:56.954
See you later, squirt.

08:08.623 --> 08:10.680
What are you doing here?
Is the chubby chase over?

08:10.681 --> 08:12.147
Woody is asleep.

08:12.148 --> 08:15.107
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm part of his life now.

08:15.108 --> 08:18.400
We are soul mates and
you should accept that.

08:18.401 --> 08:20.135
Oh, you think you're
his first girlfriend.

08:20.136 --> 08:23.913
That's cute. See, he's had many,
but it always ends the same way.

08:23.914 --> 08:29.014
Malloy, isn't this a nice
meal that Jolene made?

08:29.607 --> 08:33.087
Mwah. See you later, honey.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.852
Where did she touch you?
Point it out on the doll!

08:37.854 --> 08:39.553
Right there.

08:39.554 --> 08:41.116
A lot.

08:41.116 --> 08:43.019
And you'll be history soon too, asshole.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.336
That is how you pronounce
your name right? "Asshole".

08:45.337 --> 08:46.996
Well, I'm not like the others.

08:46.997 --> 08:49.398
You won't get rid of me so easily.

08:49.399 --> 08:51.100
And why is that?

08:51.101 --> 08:53.035
Destiny brought Woody and I together!

08:53.036 --> 08:58.173
Nobody's gonna get in the way of our love,
and if you try, I will [Bleep] kill you!

08:58.174 --> 08:59.241
Ah!

08:59.242 --> 09:02.577
Well, I'm glad we had this talk.

09:02.578 --> 09:05.114
I'll show that psycho bitch.

09:05.115 --> 09:06.510
What did you say?

09:06.511 --> 09:09.811
I said I love you, Mom.

09:13.488 --> 09:16.364
Ooh, beautiful, stress-free day.

09:16.365 --> 09:17.799
I'm starving.

09:17.800 --> 09:22.537
Must have been from burning
all those calories last night.

09:22.538 --> 09:24.504
Oh, good morning, Malloy.

09:24.505 --> 09:28.247
- Hey, what happened to your eye?
- Your girlfriend hit...

09:28.248 --> 09:32.158
The nail on the head when she told me
I shouldn't punch myself in the eye.

09:32.159 --> 09:35.335
Well, my little honey
pot gives good advice.

09:35.336 --> 09:37.631
Oh, eggs are done.

09:37.632 --> 09:40.366
- Woody, your girlfriend's a...
- Squirter? Don't I know it.

09:40.367 --> 09:42.393
It's like licking Moby Dick's blowhole.

09:42.394 --> 09:45.511
Yes, you're girlfriend's a squirter.
That's what I was trying to say.

09:45.512 --> 09:48.450
No, she's insane. She
threatened to kill me.

09:48.451 --> 09:51.119
- Insane?
- Shut up.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.561
Oh, I know what you're doing.

09:54.562 --> 09:57.407
- You want your Daddy all to yourself.
- That's not what I'm doing.

09:57.408 --> 10:01.354
She told me she's gonna come into
my room in the middle of the night...

10:01.355 --> 10:05.315
And tuck me in, like a real Mom.

10:06.123 --> 10:09.096
Wow, Mister. That is so cool!

10:09.097 --> 10:13.777
Oh, you think that's
cool? Check this out.

10:14.535 --> 10:17.835
Whoa... ho... whoa... ah!

10:18.006 --> 10:19.706
Oh!

10:19.707 --> 10:22.347
Whoa... ah! Ah!

10:24.033 --> 10:27.693
Woo! I told you it was cool.

10:31.919 --> 10:35.922
Pre-school field trip,
and not a single fatality?

10:35.923 --> 10:39.003
Oh, how refreshing. Just doing my job.

10:39.004 --> 10:40.983
Head Ranger Ethel, over and out.

10:40.984 --> 10:42.929
Ah, good job, Ethel.

10:42.930 --> 10:44.898
Oh, thank you, Ethel.

10:44.899 --> 10:48.702
Connie, I need your help. Woody's
girlfriend is bat-shit crazy.

10:48.703 --> 10:51.538
She seemed nice to me.
Maybe you're just jealous.

10:51.539 --> 10:52.906
Yeah, and maybe you're just...

10:52.907 --> 10:54.941
Ugh, I don't even have
the energy to insult you.

10:54.942 --> 10:57.210
- Just step on a scale.
- Hey!

10:57.211 --> 10:59.725
Where's all the danish?
It's bear claw Wednesday!

10:59.726 --> 11:03.506
Now it's fresh fruit Wednesday.

11:03.814 --> 11:06.376
Ugh! This doesn't taste
anything like a doughnut!

11:06.377 --> 11:08.354
I hate it!

11:08.355 --> 11:10.190
Hey, I didn't get to eat yet!

11:10.191 --> 11:11.792
Uh, but it's okay.

11:11.793 --> 11:15.246
My motto is "efficiency
through positivity".

11:15.247 --> 11:19.465
By working together, we
can achieve greatness.

11:19.466 --> 11:22.302
Sorry, probably really important.

11:22.303 --> 11:25.371
Brickleberry National Park.
Head Ranger Ethel speaking.

11:25.372 --> 11:27.307
The Park expense reports are late?

11:27.308 --> 11:29.710
We have those? I'll get right on that.

11:29.711 --> 11:31.745
[Beep] Sorry, can you hold?

11:31.746 --> 11:33.401
Hello, head Ranger Eth...

11:33.402 --> 11:36.349
What do you mean the lake's
on fire? Oh, my God, hold on.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.819
Ethel, I can't come to
work today, I'm sick.

11:38.820 --> 11:42.756
Denzel, I need you here.
Hey, are you on your jet pack?

11:42.757 --> 11:46.526
No. Hey, look, it's a flying black guy!

11:46.527 --> 11:47.961
Maybe.

11:47.962 --> 11:51.164
Calm down. A badger
ate your baby's face?

11:51.165 --> 11:54.485
Hold on. My emergency
scanner's going off!

11:54.486 --> 11:56.136
This is Ethel! What's your emergency?

11:56.137 --> 11:59.703
Ethel, it's Steve. Did you know
that Connie is afraid of raw fish?

11:59.704 --> 12:01.624
What?

12:08.182 --> 12:10.392
I don't want to say, "I told you so".

12:10.393 --> 12:13.828
Great, then don't say it, because
this jet pack is still awesome.

12:13.829 --> 12:16.049
Oh, shit!

12:22.964 --> 12:24.164
Still awesome.

12:24.165 --> 12:26.166
Denzel! What the hell did you do?

12:26.167 --> 12:28.249
Damn, Ethel. What
happened to being positive?

12:28.250 --> 12:33.206
I'm positive you're a...
yeah, right, right, positivity.

12:33.207 --> 12:35.022
Maybe you can't handle this, Ethel.

12:35.023 --> 12:38.544
Maybe I can't handle this? Running
this Park is a piece of cake!

12:38.545 --> 12:39.831
Oh, no!

12:39.832 --> 12:42.482
I brought up cake in
front of the baby elephant!

12:42.483 --> 12:44.343
Run!

12:45.253 --> 12:49.093
Wait, Connie, I didn't mean it.

12:54.196 --> 12:57.136
Oh, God. Not Steve.

13:01.302 --> 13:03.870
Oh! Oh, God, you had me worried.

13:03.871 --> 13:05.672
I thought you were gonna
do something stupid.

13:05.673 --> 13:07.974
Sorry to disappoint you, "boss".

13:07.975 --> 13:13.046
I don't think a stupid person saves
tourists or rescues rabid wolves.

13:13.047 --> 13:15.648
The wolves! Ah!

13:15.649 --> 13:18.049
Oh, my God!

13:19.775 --> 13:21.720
Malloy, why are you following me around?

13:21.721 --> 13:24.257
Because I don't want to be alone
with your insane girlfriend.

13:24.258 --> 13:27.694
You have got to stop acting weird,
Malloy. We're having a dinner party.

13:27.695 --> 13:31.666
This is the first time Daddy's
gonna meet all of Mommy's friends.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.427
<i>O qua tangin wa.</i>

13:35.065 --> 13:37.825
<i>O qua tangin wa.</i>

13:38.020 --> 13:41.140
And she's in a cult.

13:43.847 --> 13:46.417
Oh, come on, Malloy, it's not a cult.

13:46.418 --> 13:48.386
It's just Astral's church friends.

13:48.387 --> 13:50.294
They're just a little quirky.

13:50.295 --> 13:53.175
Praise Lord Targissian,
God of the Universe.

13:53.176 --> 13:57.128
May he fill our vessels
with his alien seed.

13:57.129 --> 14:01.689
Hey, it makes more
sense than Catholicism.

14:02.369 --> 14:06.022
Tourism numbers, Park
budget, safety inspection...

14:06.023 --> 14:09.785
Jet pack, Connie's
neck, Steve's fat face.

14:09.786 --> 14:11.519
Steve, Steve...

14:11.520 --> 14:15.480
Steve, you stupid son of a bitch!

14:18.383 --> 14:22.119
Do you swear loyalty to Lord Targissian?

14:22.120 --> 14:23.721
Hey, better him than Obama.

14:23.722 --> 14:25.723
What the hell is going on?

14:25.724 --> 14:28.561
Oh, Malloy, good. You got
the e-vite. Guess what?

14:28.562 --> 14:30.884
They're making me a full
member of the church.

14:30.885 --> 14:34.065
Now, Woody, there's one last step.

14:34.066 --> 14:36.434
Your sacrificial offering.

14:36.435 --> 14:38.135
Hey, Malloy, could
you grab my checkbook?

14:38.136 --> 14:39.437
Now you're giving them money?

14:39.438 --> 14:41.266
Oh, don't act like all churches

14:41.267 --> 14:47.167
don't have a one time membership
fee of your entire life savings.

14:49.114 --> 14:51.082
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

14:51.083 --> 14:54.024
Stealing me some jet fuel. They don't
sell this shit at the Exxon station.

14:54.025 --> 14:57.321
- You're under arrest.
- Uh, okay. I'll come with you quietly.

14:57.322 --> 15:00.157
- Psych!
- Hey! We got a fuel thief!

15:00.158 --> 15:04.238
Go, go, go! Move, move, move, move!

15:14.873 --> 15:18.113
Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

15:33.113 --> 15:37.073
Whew, I lost 'em. Good thing I...

15:38.053 --> 15:40.231
Listen to me. I'm not
afraid of you anymore.

15:40.232 --> 15:41.733
I'm a bear.

15:41.734 --> 15:43.601
God damn it! Ow... who does that?

15:43.602 --> 15:45.036
Why don't you get out of my house?

15:45.037 --> 15:46.804
- Okay.
- Huh.

15:46.805 --> 15:49.674
- That was easy. Wait, what's the catch?
- No catch.

15:49.675 --> 15:53.163
Tonight, Woody and I are
jumping off Brickleberry Cliff.

15:53.164 --> 15:56.614
And traveling to a new world.

15:56.615 --> 16:00.051
Could you hold on one
second, you crazy bitch?

16:00.052 --> 16:02.687
It turns out your little
fun club's a suicide cult.

16:02.688 --> 16:04.889
Do you know that you're gonna
jump off a cliff tonight?

16:04.890 --> 16:08.563
Nonsense, tonight is just
the secret church field trip.

16:08.564 --> 16:12.363
Do not go anywhere with that
maniac. She has you brainwashed.

16:12.364 --> 16:14.398
Oh, no, not this time, Malloy.

16:14.399 --> 16:17.135
You have run off every
girlfriend I've ever had.

16:17.136 --> 16:18.836
Why can't you let me be happy?

16:18.837 --> 16:21.839
Is this about the petting?
Fine, you can pet me.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.574
But you have to break up with her.

16:23.575 --> 16:25.176
I don't want your pity pet!

16:25.177 --> 16:27.311
Look, Woody, you have gotta believe me.

16:27.312 --> 16:31.353
You're a liar! Astral's right.
You don't give a shit about me!

16:31.354 --> 16:33.471
You know what, Woody? I'm
done with you! It's over!

16:33.472 --> 16:37.288
I hope you do kill yourself,
you ignorant, gullible ass...

16:37.289 --> 16:42.149
Aw, that's the cutest
stroke I've ever seen.

16:44.323 --> 16:47.858
Woody... Ethel, you don't look so good.

16:47.859 --> 16:50.228
I been stress eating.

16:50.229 --> 16:53.565
And look who's talking. You
look like a bucket of hog shit!

16:53.566 --> 16:56.968
Sorry. You haven't called the maintenance
guy to repair the washing machines.

16:56.969 --> 17:02.240
I'll get to it. Connie, tuck in that camel
toe before a plane tries to land on it.

17:02.241 --> 17:03.307
Sorry.

17:03.308 --> 17:06.277
Ugh! Denzel, what the hell
is the matter with you?

17:06.278 --> 17:11.281
Are you drunk again? You drinkin'
the 40s and stealin' our white women?

17:11.282 --> 17:13.596
Kiss my ass, Ethel. I'm
getting my Earth legs back.

17:13.597 --> 17:14.801
Where's your jet pack?

17:14.803 --> 17:17.692
I sold that shit on eBay, I tried to
tell you it was nothing but trouble.

17:17.693 --> 17:22.853
No, I tried to tell you
and you didn't listen...

17:24.796 --> 17:26.464
Shut up! Shut up!

17:26.464 --> 17:28.925
God damn it!

17:29.287 --> 17:31.987
Oh... my... God!

17:33.305 --> 17:35.072
Woody was right, I can't do this job.

17:35.073 --> 17:36.974
I had no idea how much
he had to deal with.

17:36.975 --> 17:39.944
We gotta get him back.

17:39.945 --> 17:41.779
- Malloy.
- Yes, Connie?

17:41.780 --> 17:44.382
Where the hell is Woody? We
need him to take his job back.

17:44.383 --> 17:46.633
He's gonna jump to his
death off Brickleberry Cliff

17:46.634 --> 17:48.553
with his psycho squirter girlfriend.

17:48.554 --> 17:50.421
Tried to tell ya.

17:50.422 --> 17:52.957
- We gotta get over there fast!
- Okay, I'll drive.

17:52.958 --> 17:54.492
No!

17:54.493 --> 17:57.629
So Malloy was right?
We're killing ourselves?

17:57.630 --> 17:59.330
I'm not sure about this.

17:59.331 --> 18:02.567
Nonsense. It is merely a leap of faith.

18:02.568 --> 18:07.305
A Biiavian Mother Ship will arrive
and take us to our cosmic paradise.

18:07.306 --> 18:12.910
We will be together forever, living in
bliss with anything you could ever desire.

18:12.911 --> 18:14.640
- Jumbo shrimp?
- All you can eat.

18:14.641 --> 18:16.947
[Bleep] It, let's jump.

18:16.948 --> 18:19.651
Oh, man, it's almost
time. We're running late.

18:19.652 --> 18:23.432
We can't let anything stop us.

18:24.179 --> 18:26.691
Right after I get me
some driving lasagna.

18:26.692 --> 18:29.452
<i>O qua tangin wa.</i>

18:30.397 --> 18:32.645
It is almost time, my soul mate.

18:32.646 --> 18:35.786
- Mmhmm, what'd I tell you?
- Mmm, mmm.

18:35.787 --> 18:37.868
Mmm, you're right, Steve.

18:37.869 --> 18:40.805
"Driving lasagna" does taste better.

18:40.806 --> 18:42.340
Okay.

18:42.341 --> 18:48.241
- We've still got time if we hurry.
- Wait, is that a hitchhiker?

18:48.347 --> 18:51.282
Well, that was the
last of the disciples.

18:51.283 --> 18:54.519
- I guess we're next?
- Yes.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.073
Eyes on the prize, Woody.

18:56.074 --> 18:58.611
Jumbo shrimp, jumbo
shrimp, jumbo shrimp.

18:58.612 --> 19:01.726
Left here. No... no, that's
right. You're turning right!

19:01.727 --> 19:03.060
My left or your left?

19:03.061 --> 19:04.895
Man, we gotta hurry up and save Woody.

19:04.896 --> 19:09.636
Oh, snap! Is that a
two-for-one putt-putt?

19:21.714 --> 19:23.574
Yes!

19:25.279 --> 19:28.979
Wait! We came as quick as we could.

19:28.980 --> 19:32.161
Don't do it, Woody! The Park needs you.

19:32.162 --> 19:33.991
Wait, where's Malloy?

19:33.992 --> 19:36.954
He, uh... he didn't come.

19:36.955 --> 19:38.815
Wow.

19:39.698 --> 19:43.048
I guess he really doesn't care about me.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.435
But I do.

19:44.436 --> 19:49.596
I've loved you since the
first moment I saw you.

19:50.768 --> 19:52.181
- No!
- Woody!

19:52.182 --> 19:54.762
- No!
- Woody!

19:59.117 --> 20:02.214
Oh, so he's "Malloy, the
talking bear 12" on eBay.

20:02.215 --> 20:05.110
Well, you saved me.

20:05.111 --> 20:07.250
You saved my life, Malloy.

20:07.251 --> 20:09.177
I knew you cared about me!

20:09.178 --> 20:12.146
Shut up before I drop you.

20:12.147 --> 20:15.385
What was I thinking? I don't know
how to thank you, little buddy.

20:15.386 --> 20:19.304
And all you Rangers, thank you
for always being there for me.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.165
I...

20:22.402 --> 20:24.742
The ship! It's real!

20:24.743 --> 20:26.744
I could've been on that ship!

20:26.745 --> 20:28.913
They're partying on there!

20:28.914 --> 20:30.591
Wait, is that Astral?

20:30.592 --> 20:32.643
Is... is she blowing that guy?

20:32.644 --> 20:34.491
And he's eating jumbo shrimp?

20:34.492 --> 20:37.254
Jumbo shrimp! They got jumbo shrimp!

20:37.255 --> 20:40.615
Damn it! Wait! Come back!

20:44.663 --> 20:46.897
I will never forgive you, Malloy!

20:46.898 --> 20:49.598
As long as I...
