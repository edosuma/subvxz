00:03.852 --> 00:05.119
- It was a stupid, drunken kiss.
- I want you out of here!

00:05.154 --> 00:06.154
<i>Toby: Rise and shine.</i>

00:06.188 --> 00:09.123
Man, I am buying you a new couch.

00:09.158 --> 00:11.125
Or you could just go
home and apologize to mom

00:11.160 --> 00:13.094
for making out with my mother-in-law.

00:13.128 --> 00:15.430
It's my decision. And
it doesn't affect you.

00:15.464 --> 00:17.465
It does affect me. I care about you.

00:17.499 --> 00:19.367
What's your deal? Are you into him?

00:19.401 --> 00:21.068
I do have feelings for Campbell.

00:21.103 --> 00:23.137
But I have them for you too.

00:23.172 --> 00:25.006
- What's wrong?
- I can't move my fingers.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.174
She has two lacerated tendons.

00:26.208 --> 00:27.275
Middle and index finger.

00:27.309 --> 00:29.444
- What do we do?
- We'll get in there

00:29.478 --> 00:31.078
and we'll surgically repair the tendons.

00:31.113 --> 00:32.113
Will she still be able to paint and draw?

00:32.147 --> 00:33.147
We'll do our best.

00:33.182 --> 00:35.049
Pop it. Like a balloon.

(Groans, gasps)

00:38.437 --> 00:39.403
(Sighs)

00:41.240 --> 00:43.224
You did good.

00:50.210 --> 00:52.495
So you definitely have it. For sure?

00:52.546 --> 00:54.213
<i>Okay, great.</i>

00:54.248 --> 00:55.248
I'll see you later.

00:55.282 --> 00:56.282
Thank you.

00:56.316 --> 00:57.333
Ha!

00:57.384 --> 00:59.252
What's up with you?

00:59.286 --> 01:02.054
You are looking at a man with a plan.

01:02.089 --> 01:05.057
Does that plan involve a
laundry basket and a mop?

01:05.092 --> 01:06.125
That's funny.

01:06.159 --> 01:08.094
It's a plan to get through to your mother.

01:08.128 --> 01:11.397
She wants to be won back?
She will be won back.

01:11.431 --> 01:13.466
Sounds great. What's the plan?

01:13.500 --> 01:16.269
I'm not quite ready to spill the beans yet.

01:16.303 --> 01:18.137
Okay. Well, good luck.

01:18.171 --> 01:19.372
I'm sure she'll love whatever
you have up your sleeve.

01:19.406 --> 01:21.507
You know, I really think she will.

_

01:42.562 --> 01:45.064
Actually, there's one more thing.

01:45.098 --> 01:48.050
I was thinking about casting a wider net.

01:48.101 --> 01:49.168
Really?

01:49.202 --> 01:51.337
But you always wanted to go to Gallaudet.

01:51.371 --> 01:52.505
I know, and I do.

01:52.539 --> 01:55.507
But I was thinking about
applying to a few schools

01:55.525 --> 01:57.543
that have a strong pre-med program.

01:57.578 --> 02:00.179
Pre-med.

02:00.213 --> 02:02.198
I don't know. Do you guys think it's crazy?

You know what... I think
I'm just gonna go home.

Oh, Kathryn Kennish.

02:40.470 --> 02:42.438
To everything there is a season.

02:42.472 --> 02:44.340
And a time to every purpose under the sun.

02:44.374 --> 02:46.175
A time to love.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.309
A time to hate.

02:47.344 --> 02:49.245
A time to diet. A time to pig out.

02:49.279 --> 02:50.346
A time to...

02:50.380 --> 02:52.281
- Renzo, I...
- Look.

02:52.375 --> 02:55.644
I know you're sad.

02:55.679 --> 02:57.613
But wallowing in it isn't going to help.

All right, everyone. Let's get started.

was gonna look to Pratt,

why I was dropping it.

- I'm just gonna keep my head down</i>

06:13.243 --> 06:14.276
- Hmm.
- So...

06:14.311 --> 06:15.377
I'm just hoping everything's

06:15.395 --> 06:17.413
going to be back to normal by then.

Hey. There's a whole pan

06:43.173 --> 06:44.206
of pipettes that need to be cleaned.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.207
Okay.

06:45.241 --> 06:47.176
I was actually going to ask you something.

06:47.210 --> 06:49.211
Is there any way

06:49.245 --> 06:52.147
that I could take on more
responsibility around here?

06:52.182 --> 06:55.184
I'd be really grateful for
any opportunities to learn,

06:55.218 --> 06:57.586
and the whole Dr. J thing
kind of got me thinking that...

06:57.604 --> 06:59.421
That you're a hero?

06:59.456 --> 07:00.622
From what I understand,

07:00.657 --> 07:02.458
you and your friend

07:02.492 --> 07:05.294
tricked a violent, mentally unstable woman

07:05.328 --> 07:07.463
into coming here after hours.

07:07.497 --> 07:09.264
You're getting credit for fixing something

07:09.299 --> 07:12.468
that should have never
happened in the first place.

07:12.502 --> 07:14.503

09:23.500 --> 09:26.135
Dress up. That's still cool?

09:33.476 --> 09:36.545

see what you came up with.

What is this?

09:55.431 --> 09:57.232
It's a memory.

09:59.502 --> 10:01.170
didn't match my parents'.

10:01.204 --> 10:03.372
That's my thumbprint. I scanned it.

10:03.406 --> 10:06.274
<i>And enlarged it. That's blood, obviously.</i>

10:06.292 --> 10:08.277
What's this supposed to mean?

10:08.311 --> 10:10.412
How is this supposed to make me feel?

10:10.446 --> 10:15.417
How confused and worried I was.

10:15.451 --> 10:17.336
Well, the only thing it's making me feel

10:17.387 --> 10:19.354
is annoyed at how little you tried.

10:19.389 --> 10:21.490
My tendon snapped.

10:21.524 --> 10:23.358
And that sucks.

10:23.393 --> 10:25.360
And I'm sorry about that.

10:25.395 --> 10:26.528
But you're an artist,

10:26.563 --> 10:28.497
and an artist figures it out.

10:28.531 --> 10:30.432
I'm trying here, but my toolbox

10:30.466 --> 10:32.201

_

10:55.884 --> 10:57.684

that you can dance?

11:03.091 --> 11:05.058
It's not that hard.

11:07.795 --> 11:10.664
If Emmett can play the drums,

11:10.698 --> 11:12.065
I'm pretty sure you can figure out,

11:12.100 --> 11:14.001
you know, how to do the robot

11:14.035 --> 11:16.637
or the Gangnam style.

11:16.671 --> 11:19.546
You know, whatever.

Don't worry, man.

Hi.

12:34.946 --> 12:36.713
Hi.

12:36.748 --> 12:38.549
How's your hand?

12:38.583 --> 12:40.651
Oh, it's perfect.

12:40.685 --> 12:42.553
<i>As long as I don't sign,</i>

12:42.587 --> 12:44.855
or brush my teeth, or eat, or draw.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.691
I'm sorry I didn't come by sooner.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.544
It's okay.

12:56.935 --> 12:58.902
That looks like a pretty good start.

12:58.937 --> 13:01.572
It looks like a baby drew it.

13:01.606 --> 13:04.508
And I know people paint with their toes

13:04.542 --> 13:05.576
and paint with their teeth.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.727
Well, I paint with my hands.

13:06.778 --> 13:08.812
And I actually need mine to do what I do.

13:08.846 --> 13:10.881
Aren't you supposed to be resting it?

13:10.915 --> 13:13.584
I have an assignment.
There's no getting out of it.

13:13.618 --> 13:14.885
That's ridiculous. Let
me call your teacher.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.753
I appreciate you trying to save the day

13:16.788 --> 13:17.921
and be all parental,

13:17.956 --> 13:19.823
but I just want to ice this thing

13:19.857 --> 13:21.909
and be alone, so...
yeah, I'll see you later.

13:31.903 --> 13:33.904
She's been yelling at everybody.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.540
I wish I could do something to help her.

13:36.574 --> 13:38.542
You know,

13:38.576 --> 13:40.677
I may know someone who...

13:40.712 --> 13:41.812
would welcome your help.

13:41.846 --> 13:44.815
Sure. What do you need?

Here.

14:03.935 --> 14:04.901
Let me.

14:07.622 --> 14:09.756
Relax.

14:09.791 --> 14:11.758
Stay straight. Straight.

14:11.793 --> 14:13.844
Not so straight. Relax.

14:13.878 --> 14:15.846
No. Not so relaxed.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.514
Keep your head up.

14:17.548 --> 14:19.916
It looks a little sloppy
here. Okay. Now lead me.

14:19.951 --> 14:23.553
All right? One, two,
three. One, two, three.

14:23.587 --> 14:27.691
One... you don't have to
squeeze her like that, okay?

14:27.725 --> 14:30.694
Um, look... dancing with a woman

14:30.728 --> 14:32.863
is like making love.

14:32.897 --> 14:35.599
You have to be in charge.

14:37.568 --> 14:38.902

14:41.572 --> 14:43.707
Okay, let's try one more time.

going to give you a tempo.

Yeah, please.

15:20.945 --> 15:23.613
Guys, just like this,

15:23.647 --> 15:25.665
right? And then you get a little better.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.667
And then you give her a little dip.

15:27.702 --> 15:29.786
If you're a good leader...

15:31.672 --> 15:32.989
she doesn't need to know the steps,

15:33.024 --> 15:35.825
if you know how to lead.

15:51.576 --> 15:52.692
Voilà !

15:54.746 --> 15:56.012
Easy.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.914
See? Easy.

16:05.734 --> 16:07.601
Of course Bay's surgeon is reputable.

Bye.

Hey.

16:20.449 --> 16:21.449
Hi.

16:21.483 --> 16:23.418
I bought you a little something.

16:23.452 --> 16:24.752
Oh.

16:24.787 --> 16:25.887
Should I open it?

16:25.921 --> 16:27.588
Please.

16:31.694 --> 16:33.728
It's lovely.

16:33.762 --> 16:34.862
Thank you.

16:34.897 --> 16:37.732
You're welcome. Try it on. It's a...

16:37.766 --> 16:41.502
14-karat gold diamond bracelet
from Prentice Brothers.

16:41.537 --> 16:43.604
Yeah. How did you know that?

16:43.639 --> 16:45.740
Because I already have it.

16:45.774 --> 16:48.509
You bought me the same one
for Christmas four years ago.

16:48.544 --> 16:50.611
- Remember?
- I did.

16:50.646 --> 16:51.779
(Sighs)

16:51.814 --> 16:53.664
I'll exchange it for something else.

16:53.699 --> 16:54.849
A really nice gesture.

16:54.883 --> 16:57.852
But a bracelet is not gonna fix

16:57.886 --> 17:00.555
the problems that we're having.

17:00.629 --> 17:03.431
Please tell me that
there's something I can do

17:03.465 --> 17:05.566
to help you stop being so upset with me.

17:05.601 --> 17:07.602
I'm not mad anymore.

17:07.636 --> 17:09.470
I just need a little space

17:09.505 --> 17:11.439
to figure out what's
going to make me happy.

17:11.473 --> 17:14.474
Okay, just tell me what
that is, and I'll do it.

17:14.510 --> 17:16.544
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

17:16.578 --> 17:18.780
Maybe I'm having an existential crisis.

17:18.814 --> 17:20.731
Maybe it's empty-nest syndrome.

17:20.766 --> 17:23.885
Maybe it's early menopause or depression.

17:23.919 --> 17:26.753
I don't know, it's just... I'm not happy.

17:26.789 --> 17:28.923
(Sobs) I don't want to cook the same meals.

17:28.957 --> 17:31.559
I don't want to watch the same shows.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.828
I don't want to give each
other the same presents...

17:33.862 --> 17:38.599
year after year, like
we're stuck on repeat.

17:38.634 --> 17:41.636
I want adventure.

17:41.670 --> 17:43.805
Maybe it's too much to ask.

17:43.839 --> 17:45.573
Maybe it's unfair.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.708
But that's what I want.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.879
I have to go.

Excuse me?

18:17.539 --> 18:19.540
You know, before you came along,

18:19.575 --> 18:21.475
Kathryn was fine.

18:21.510 --> 18:23.544
She wasn't lying to me.

18:23.579 --> 18:25.479
She wasn't blowing off her
family for a drum circle

18:25.514 --> 18:26.814
or dance or whatever.

18:26.849 --> 18:28.449
She was happy.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.917
- Wait a minute.
- Is this what you do?

18:29.952 --> 18:32.820
You go around breaking
up people's marriages?

18:32.855 --> 18:35.656
Poisoning women's minds with these, like,

18:35.691 --> 18:37.825
notions of how much they're missing out on

18:37.860 --> 18:39.927
with their boring, patriarchal husbands?

18:39.962 --> 18:41.829
Well, guess what... congratulations.

18:41.864 --> 18:43.831
It worked.

18:43.866 --> 18:45.867
You will yell, scream,

18:45.901 --> 18:48.703
and point fingers... anything...

18:48.737 --> 18:51.772

19:34.650 --> 19:37.451
I wasn't really Bay Kennish.

19:37.486 --> 19:39.787

36:17.947 --> 36:22.083
Hospitals kept "losing" my
application for residency.

36:22.118 --> 36:23.852
And even when I got in,

36:23.886 --> 36:26.754
everyone kept waiting
for me to make mistakes

36:26.789 --> 36:28.022
to kick me out.

36:28.057 --> 36:29.924
That's horrible.

36:29.959 --> 36:31.759
The point is,

36:31.794 --> 36:34.929
no one's going to hand you a ladder.

36:34.964 --> 36:36.097
If you want it bad enough,

36:36.132 --> 36:37.832
you'll build your own.

36:39.168 --> 36:42.103
But being deaf is
different than being black.

36:42.138 --> 36:44.806
I might actually

36:44.840 --> 36:46.207
not be able to do the job.

36:46.242 --> 36:47.942
So you'll make adjustments.

all the road blocks in the world

36:52.948 --> 36:56.918

36:58.754 --> 37:00.705
it's over.

37:14.715 --> 37:16.716
Actually, Emmett did that.

37:16.750 --> 37:19.352
He deserves all the credit.

37:19.386 --> 37:20.820
What do you mean?

37:20.854 --> 37:22.688
I had the idea,

37:22.723 --> 37:24.624
but he figured out the camera settings,

37:24.658 --> 37:25.825
and he showed me how to take these

37:25.843 --> 37:28.561
individual frames of this video

37:28.595 --> 37:29.729
of a dancer.

37:29.763 --> 37:32.799
He even helped me build
it because I couldn't.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.534
So?

37:34.568 --> 37:36.369
It was still your idea.

37:36.403 --> 37:38.471
Everyone thinks that if
you have a great idea,

37:38.505 --> 37:40.540
everything else just falls into place,

37:40.574 --> 37:42.441

37:43.510 --> 37:44.777
Every little tiny choice.

37:44.812 --> 37:46.612
That is what art is.

37:46.647 --> 37:48.698
See? Even that you know that,

37:48.732 --> 37:50.716
you are such an artist.

37:50.751 --> 37:52.702
You'll figure it out.
