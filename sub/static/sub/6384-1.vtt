00:14.842 --> 00:16.846
<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

00:16.966 --> 00:18.721
I'm having a crisis of faith.

00:19.167 --> 00:20.762
Put it simply, I can't write.

00:20.882 --> 00:24.139
You have this incredible talent
and you're flushing it down the toilet.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.846
Maybe you're right.
I'm fucked up right now.

00:27.006 --> 00:29.385
- I need you, baby.
- I'm getting married.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.707
- Is Dad a bad person?
- No, not at all.

00:32.979 --> 00:35.755
I mean, he does have a habit
of getting into trouble sometimes.

00:35.937 --> 00:37.188
Fucking fucker!

00:39.419 --> 00:42.652
Get on with your life, and forget about
the woman you didn't wanna marry.

00:42.772 --> 00:44.147
As your friend and agent,

00:44.357 --> 00:46.942
may I suggest
you start looking for a nice girl?

00:47.062 --> 00:50.704
- What is your name, by the way?
- Wouldn't you rather just fuck me?

00:51.014 --> 00:52.679
I'm a scientologist, Hank.

00:54.518 --> 00:56.592
So, you're this famous writer, huh?

00:57.709 --> 00:59.312
This is Mia, Bill's daughter.

01:00.484 --> 01:01.281
She's 16.

01:01.534 --> 01:04.784
What happened the other night
will never happen again.

01:04.962 --> 01:07.221
I know you guys aren't gonna live
happily ever after.

01:07.341 --> 01:09.331
It's just nice
to be together sometimes.

01:09.451 --> 01:11.776
I wanna go back
and do it all over again.

01:11.896 --> 01:13.312
I'm gonna marry Bill.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.162
- I wrote something.
- You what?

01:16.372 --> 01:18.179
Hank wrote a new book?
Can I read it?

01:18.299 --> 01:20.130
- t's not appropriate.
- What did you write?

01:20.277 --> 01:22.953
An older man unwittingly bed
an underage girl.

01:23.073 --> 01:24.129
I wrote this novel.

01:24.249 --> 01:26.003
She wrote the book of the year.

01:26.166 --> 01:26.906
Really?

01:27.253 --> 01:29.968
If I say anything, there's no
stopping her from telling Karen.

01:30.088 --> 01:31.388
Fuck, the police!

01:31.558 --> 01:34.693
If anyone knows of a reason
why this couple should not wed,

01:34.813 --> 01:36.579
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

01:36.699 --> 01:37.518
What?

01:38.321 --> 01:40.228
- Wait! Hank!
- You sure?

01:40.398 --> 01:43.868
- Quick, before I change my mind.
- Karen, wait! Come back!

02:30.331 --> 02:31.481
Are you ready?

02:34.276 --> 02:35.266
Fuck, no.

02:36.631 --> 02:39.758
You are gonna be so glad
you did this.

02:39.928 --> 02:41.683
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

02:41.803 --> 02:44.484
I got a God-like erection,
seems a shame to waste it.

02:46.028 --> 02:48.112
- We gotta get going.
- Really?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.953
You would deny a dying man
his final meal?

02:51.807 --> 02:52.857
Oh, my God.

02:53.121 --> 02:55.536
You are going to milk this
for all it's worth, aren't you?

02:55.656 --> 02:56.747
Absolutely.

02:56.867 --> 02:59.017
Don't make me beg, it's unseemly.

03:00.537 --> 03:01.347
Fine.

03:01.772 --> 03:05.622
- We'd better make it snappy.
- You won't feel a thing, I promise.

03:07.125 --> 03:10.142
- What are you doing?
- Just assuming the posish.

03:10.787 --> 03:11.882
Hot digidy.

03:12.444 --> 03:15.369
- What are you doing?
- Assuming my posish.

03:15.774 --> 03:17.019
Get a rubber.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.199
One more time, what's the big deal?

03:19.319 --> 03:22.670
That's my point, exactly.
I'll pull out and hose you down.

03:24.488 --> 03:26.526
Is that supposed to turn me on?

03:26.774 --> 03:28.251
- Maybe?
- Hank...

03:28.371 --> 03:30.029
- It didn't?
- Not so much.

03:37.944 --> 03:39.780
You better start talking dirty.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.550
This could take a while.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.546
- What do you want me to say?
- Right before you come,

03:47.866 --> 03:49.030
call me Bill.

03:50.293 --> 03:51.849
Who says I'm gonna come?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.650
A challenge.

03:54.498 --> 03:55.420
Game on.

03:57.927 --> 03:59.777
Get ready for Thor's hammer.

04:07.393 --> 04:09.469
- You wanna see it?
- See what?

04:09.629 --> 04:12.071
The section
of the vas def I just cut out.

04:12.282 --> 04:13.745
Vas def-initely not.

04:13.915 --> 04:17.791
If it feels like I'm sewing the flesh
of the base of your penis back together,

04:17.911 --> 04:19.048
that's because I am.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.918
Why do you look like a welder?
You're not welding anything, are you?

04:22.142 --> 04:23.432
So, why the vasectomy?

04:23.810 --> 04:25.277
I hate the rubbers.

04:25.877 --> 04:26.886
Yeah, me too.

04:27.246 --> 04:28.588
I can't feel a damn thing.

04:29.882 --> 04:31.591
Try not to give the guy a hard-on.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.726
That would be messy.

04:36.842 --> 04:38.447
Looks like there's a new Pope.

04:38.658 --> 04:40.343
Pain and swelling, totally normal.

04:40.513 --> 04:43.248
A bag of frozen peas should do
the trick. Some prefer anemone.

04:43.418 --> 04:44.933
It's totally up to you.

04:45.103 --> 04:47.933
No sex for 48 hours
and that includes masturbation.

04:48.103 --> 04:49.778
After that, the more the better.

04:49.898 --> 04:50.808
Seriously.

04:50.928 --> 04:53.203
You still got a lot of viable sperm
up in there.

04:53.323 --> 04:55.065
Gotta get it out somehow.

04:55.185 --> 04:57.085
If you need any help, let me know.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.705
Great-looking cock.

05:01.950 --> 05:02.886
Thank you.

05:54.097 --> 05:56.453
Don't think I don't see
what's happening here.

05:56.573 --> 05:57.498
What's that?

05:57.618 --> 05:59.677
You're not attracted to me anymore.

05:59.797 --> 06:01.215
That's right.

06:01.335 --> 06:03.349
I ran away with you
on my wedding night

06:03.602 --> 06:06.337
because you just don't
do it for me anymore.

06:06.457 --> 06:08.172
See, on a purely chemical level,

06:08.292 --> 06:10.822
you realize
that I can't impregnate you anymore.

06:10.942 --> 06:13.359
The biological imperative
has been compromized.

06:13.570 --> 06:16.632
You should consider yourself lucky
that we are even having sex.

06:16.802 --> 06:19.013
I do. I do, and it's been rad.

06:19.461 --> 06:21.717
I forgot what a little hellcat
you can be.

06:22.776 --> 06:25.866
- No, please, don't do that. Seriously.
- That was gross.

06:26.036 --> 06:27.956
Man should not meow. Ever.

06:28.641 --> 06:30.746
We're doing what couples do, Hank.

06:30.866 --> 06:33.132
We're making responsible,

06:33.437 --> 06:35.602
grown-up decisions together.

06:36.026 --> 06:39.176
- Why are you smiling like that?
- How am I smiling?

06:39.660 --> 06:40.835
Like a retard.

06:42.266 --> 06:45.775
This is nice to hear you refer to us
as a couple again. It sounded good.

06:47.906 --> 06:50.356
They really did neuter you,
didn't they?

06:51.078 --> 06:52.328
Kiss the eunuch.

06:54.501 --> 06:57.420
- Honey! God, don't grind it.
- I know, I'm so sorry.

07:14.510 --> 07:15.821
How's the package?

07:15.941 --> 07:18.541
It's not a conversation
I ever wanted to have with my daughter,

07:18.661 --> 07:20.470
but thanks for asking, sweetie.

07:20.590 --> 07:21.527
She called.

07:22.021 --> 07:22.871
She who?

07:23.260 --> 07:24.764
That real estate whore.

07:24.975 --> 07:26.691
She's bringing some people by.

07:26.811 --> 07:28.167
Language, young lady.

07:28.378 --> 07:31.221
Next time she tells me to clean my room,
I'm gonna say,

07:31.341 --> 07:32.778
"Clean this, lady"

07:32.898 --> 07:34.440
and give her a titty twister.

07:36.507 --> 07:38.286
As much as I'd like to see that,

07:38.406 --> 07:40.713
the idea is to sell this place
and get out of dodge.

07:41.119 --> 07:43.650
If you tidied up your shrine
to Norwegian death metal,

07:43.770 --> 07:45.351
it might facilitate things a bit.

07:45.562 --> 07:48.430
I don't wanna help sell the place,
because I don't wanna move.

07:48.550 --> 07:49.900
This is our home.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.550
We're happy here.

07:51.791 --> 07:52.916
I love L.A.

07:53.412 --> 07:54.694
She's your daughter.

07:56.006 --> 07:58.431
Hey, honey, not that I mind having
this conversation

07:58.591 --> 07:59.699
for the 73rd time,

07:59.925 --> 08:02.702
but could we do it maybe
when Daddy's balls don't ache so much?

08:02.913 --> 08:04.973
And it's black metal, not Norwegian.

08:05.093 --> 08:06.513
She needs more time.

08:06.828 --> 08:10.359
Karen, we have discussed this
like the responsible parents we are.

08:10.634 --> 08:13.045
Hank, New York will always
be there for us.

08:13.205 --> 08:14.918
You agreed she'd be
better off in NY.

08:15.041 --> 08:17.139
But it doesn't mean
we have the right to yank her away

08:17.259 --> 08:19.027
- from the only life she knows.
- God.

08:19.147 --> 08:20.902
Dammit, I need a cigarette.

08:21.761 --> 08:23.143
How about a Vicodin?

08:23.834 --> 08:24.906
I like it then.

08:25.117 --> 08:26.159
That'll do.

08:27.858 --> 08:29.553
My poor little gelding.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.042
That's mean.

08:37.520 --> 08:38.357
Peas!

08:38.934 --> 08:40.051
Or anemone.

09:10.601 --> 09:11.711
Feels nice.

09:18.741 --> 09:20.213
Make yourself at home.

09:21.588 --> 09:23.326
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

09:24.649 --> 09:27.313
Might wanna start
out at the patio, though.

09:33.793 --> 09:36.863
Hey, big fellow. You think I might get
my hands on some frozen veggies, there?

09:37.070 --> 09:39.540
Think you should wait
your fucking turn.

09:46.883 --> 09:47.683
You.

09:48.184 --> 09:48.984
Me.

09:49.219 --> 09:52.011
- We...
- Sure did. A couple of times, actually.

09:52.222 --> 09:53.364
Long time ago.

09:53.484 --> 09:55.389
In a galaxy not so far away.

09:57.204 --> 09:58.654
So, what's going on?

09:58.878 --> 10:02.239
Not much, I'm just, you know,
in the market for some frozen peas.

10:02.409 --> 10:03.872
Maybe some anemone.

10:04.216 --> 10:05.410
Totally up to me.

10:06.703 --> 10:09.110
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, why? I'm fine.

10:09.941 --> 10:12.948
- You seem like you're in pain.
- No more than usual.

10:13.611 --> 10:14.870
How are you doing?

10:15.105 --> 10:17.411
Old same old.
Living <i>la vida loca</i>.

10:17.581 --> 10:20.102
True that.
It's hard out there for a pimp.

10:22.111 --> 10:22.911
So...

10:24.652 --> 10:27.562
You wanna get high
and listen to some...

10:28.182 --> 10:29.130
records?

10:30.191 --> 10:31.090
Oh, dear.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.116
Would that I could but...

10:34.514 --> 10:36.589
Big life changes
since the last we met alone.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.574
I got back together with the ex.

10:39.715 --> 10:40.759
Baby mom.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.368
So I...

10:44.595 --> 10:45.698
That's too bad.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.988
You were a great lay.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.997
Well, that is...

10:51.909 --> 10:54.362
so sweet of you to say.

10:54.532 --> 10:56.825
I will tell the old lady you said so.

10:57.623 --> 10:58.778
Be well, Hank.

11:04.990 --> 11:05.876
You too.

11:11.492 --> 11:12.633
Surfer girl.

11:13.318 --> 11:14.994
What are you, some kind of pussy?

11:15.291 --> 11:16.996
She would have totally fucked you.

11:17.156 --> 11:19.465
- I don't do that anymore.
- You should do that.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.935
While you still can. You never know when
you're gonna wind up in one of these.

11:23.072 --> 11:24.832
Come on,
you don't really need that thing.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.343
I bet you just like to zip around.
It makes you feel special.

11:27.669 --> 11:30.058
Yeah? You ever hear
of a prolapsed rectum?

11:30.466 --> 11:31.394
Asshole.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.180
Rectum?

11:35.328 --> 11:36.888
Damn near killed him.

11:40.174 --> 11:41.207
Yeah? No.

11:41.404 --> 11:43.189
She was there when I left.

12:05.107 --> 12:06.281
You, Becca.

12:07.351 --> 12:08.779
In the car, now.

12:09.294 --> 12:11.350
- Dad...
- I'm not fucking around, now.

12:12.664 --> 12:13.842
Give me that.

12:17.658 --> 12:19.458
So who is this? Like your dad?

12:19.669 --> 12:20.628
Go away.

12:21.096 --> 12:22.561
I'm serious, I'll kill you.

12:24.092 --> 12:25.735
The guy is kind of a dick.

12:35.015 --> 12:35.933
Kind of?

12:36.732 --> 12:38.259
I don't want her hanging out here.

12:38.379 --> 12:41.510
What am I supposed to do? Kick her to
the curb? She's my little sudo sister.

12:41.630 --> 12:42.851
What is that?

12:44.877 --> 12:46.115
It's not a memoire.

12:46.235 --> 12:48.558
It's a written account
of my sexual relationship with you.

12:48.681 --> 12:50.589
Written by me, as a fucking novel.

12:51.336 --> 12:53.893
Even I'm confused
and I stole the damn thing.

12:54.053 --> 12:55.625
Well I hope you're enjoying it.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.764
I hope all my hard work
is paying off for you. Is it?

12:58.975 --> 13:00.420
It is, very much so.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.735
Just as I hope
you're enjoying my father's wife.

13:04.006 --> 13:06.288
- He says "hi", by the way.
- No, he doesn't.

13:13.890 --> 13:14.988
Are you alright?

13:15.832 --> 13:16.631
Here?

13:17.074 --> 13:18.333
You're all alone.

13:20.134 --> 13:22.994
Much as it warms the cockles
to hear you say it...

13:23.228 --> 13:24.820
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

13:24.940 --> 13:27.893
Worry about the Becca,
she's pissed off and she's scared.

13:28.717 --> 13:29.585
Scared?

13:30.573 --> 13:33.396
Think about it.
She got what she always wanted.

13:33.516 --> 13:36.138
The happy ending
to beat all happy endings.

13:36.258 --> 13:39.805
She's just waiting for the other shoe
to drop. For you to fuck it up.

13:40.346 --> 13:42.524
Or for Karen to realize
she made a big mistake.

13:42.786 --> 13:44.573
Both are bound to happen.

13:46.253 --> 13:48.253
Goddammit, I need a cigarette.

13:51.618 --> 13:52.498
Goodbye.

14:02.365 --> 14:04.114
I know you're pissed at me.

14:04.234 --> 14:06.813
I know your mother and I have done
some unforgivable shit to you,

14:06.933 --> 14:09.263
and I know you're approaching
that age where the very thought

14:09.383 --> 14:12.727
of having a conversation
with your father makes you nauseous.

14:12.847 --> 14:16.452
But I just wanted you to know
that I'm not gonna quit trying. Okay?

14:17.845 --> 14:20.753
'Cause you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

14:21.618 --> 14:23.385
I love the shit outta you.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.081
How's the balls?

14:31.472 --> 14:34.158
The boys have seen better days,
thank you.

14:34.930 --> 14:36.305
Was that a laugh?

14:37.067 --> 14:40.464
My pain is funny to you?
Jesus, you're just like your mother.

14:40.584 --> 14:44.470
You should know what that woman put me
through. It is a hideous, barbaric...

14:44.680 --> 14:46.534
Almost medieval procedure.

14:46.704 --> 14:49.035
Hank buddy,
you're preaching the choir, okay?

14:49.155 --> 14:51.175
- I've been there.
- You've been vasectomized?

14:51.295 --> 14:53.382
Why do you think
we don't have any little rugrats?

14:53.505 --> 14:55.548
I guess I just always assumed
you were barren.

14:55.897 --> 14:56.818
Asshole.

14:56.988 --> 14:59.306
- Be nice to my wounded soldier.
- He started it.

14:59.426 --> 15:02.085
- Or the bald eagle was shooting blanks.
- That I am, my good man.

15:02.205 --> 15:05.524
- Ever since the snip snip snip.
- Well, the second one.

15:05.761 --> 15:07.775
- You're gonna freak him out.
- What 2nd one?

15:07.895 --> 15:10.412
- The second what?
- You know, it...

15:10.672 --> 15:13.021
Sometimes, it doesn't take.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.236
Doesn't take? That's not cool.

15:15.356 --> 15:18.287
That's not cool at all. No, no.
I did not have a perfectly good

15:18.497 --> 15:20.898
chunk of my vas def cut off
so I could go back

15:21.018 --> 15:23.309
to wearing condoms
like some pimply face teenager.

15:23.469 --> 15:25.293
- I love the rubbers.
- Why?

15:25.413 --> 15:28.164
- What do you mean?
- They slow me down, man.

15:28.374 --> 15:30.549
- Keep me in the game.
- Retard sensation.

15:30.709 --> 15:33.886
- You know what I'm saying?
- He's an excitable warm.

15:34.046 --> 15:36.589
Are you intimating
that he ejaculates prematurely?

15:38.067 --> 15:40.270
- Nice, thank you.
- Great.

15:42.649 --> 15:44.997
Why would you guys want to go back

15:45.157 --> 15:47.493
- to that disgusting city of yours?
- Don't bring that up.

15:47.613 --> 15:51.314
- It's because it's a city.
- Come on, "this is a city".

15:56.368 --> 15:58.961
So, yeah, this is Sonia, hey.

16:00.295 --> 16:01.230
Awkward.

16:04.863 --> 16:07.169
- Hey, Karen!
- Hey, Sonia!

16:08.066 --> 16:10.660
- Nice to see you again.
- I found something that works better...

16:10.833 --> 16:14.226
You mean to say that you found
something better that a sudo religious

16:14.396 --> 16:17.179
cult founded
by a lunatic sci-fi hack?

16:17.439 --> 16:20.253
- Do tell.
- It's a little complicated over drinks.

16:20.373 --> 16:22.722
Maybe lunch tomorrow?
It's been too long.

16:22.842 --> 16:24.742
- Sure.
- Hold on a second.

16:24.862 --> 16:28.949
I'm not sure I feel about 2 ladies with
whom I've made love lunching together.

16:29.952 --> 16:32.829
Okay. I'm pretty sure
I feel pretty good about it.

16:33.305 --> 16:35.781
It's cute. You guys are...
You're officially back together?

16:36.212 --> 16:38.399
For now, untill we fuck it up.

16:39.211 --> 16:41.053
Could be any second now.

16:41.457 --> 16:44.874
- Dude, Julien is a writer too.
- Really? My condolences.

16:45.494 --> 16:48.210
He wrote <i>The Artist Within</i>.
Fucking genius.

16:48.478 --> 16:50.412
- No way.
- Check please.

16:50.801 --> 16:51.997
Hank, that's rude.

16:52.157 --> 16:54.633
- I'll send you guys a copy if you want.
- No need.

16:54.793 --> 16:57.303
I have it on my night stand right now.
I love it.

16:58.405 --> 16:59.842
Let me try to understand this.

17:00.015 --> 17:03.108
Hold on a second, you write about
what it's like to be an artist.

17:03.318 --> 17:06.367
- Don't be a douche, Hank.
- You ask the impossible, sweetheart.

17:06.740 --> 17:09.632
It's fine, he's trying the negativity.
It's normal.

17:10.752 --> 17:12.444
What I write about

17:12.565 --> 17:14.323
is accessing the artist

17:14.569 --> 17:16.829
that exists
inside of every single one of us.

17:16.949 --> 17:19.180
That really works.
I mean, I've never been happier.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.527
My business has never been better.

17:21.686 --> 17:25.030
In fact, I'm thinking about expanding.
Bringing on an architect we should talk.

17:25.355 --> 17:29.016
So you really believe
that everybody on this planet

17:29.186 --> 17:32.031
has an artist inside them?

17:32.422 --> 17:34.881
Like an inner schnapple, if you will?

17:35.051 --> 17:35.891
I do.

17:36.101 --> 17:38.510
Which means
you must consider yourself an artist.

17:39.556 --> 17:43.232
I like to think of myself as more
of a... creative midwife.

17:43.442 --> 17:46.391
Well, I like to think of myself
as having a 12-inch cock,

17:46.561 --> 17:48.170
but it doesn't make it so.

17:48.430 --> 17:49.772
Two inches shy.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.253
Well, we have to get going, baby.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.499
- Fashionable late is one thing.
- Oh, right.

17:56.619 --> 17:59.498
You know what? We're going to
this party up in Laurel Canyon.

17:59.658 --> 18:01.842
- You guys wanna come?
- And in fucking up this house?

18:01.962 --> 18:03.332
A party? Even us?

18:05.182 --> 18:06.268
Fucking A, let's go.

18:06.388 --> 18:08.173
- Really?
- No, but have fun.

18:22.459 --> 18:24.623
- Quit smoking.
- Wow, lucky you.

18:24.743 --> 18:26.089
No, I'm gonna pass.

18:26.209 --> 18:29.230
- What did you give it up for lent?
- No, I'm...

18:29.811 --> 18:32.376
I'm pregnant.
You didn't notice my bump?

18:32.885 --> 18:35.076
Yeah, I did, I just thought
you put on weight.

18:35.196 --> 18:37.243
I'm kidding.
Congratulations.

18:37.712 --> 18:40.123
Thanks, thank you.
Yeah, we're very happy.

18:40.243 --> 18:41.547
Well done, lady.

18:42.060 --> 18:45.105
Last time I saw you, you were boning
at a gender at doggie style

18:45.225 --> 18:47.283
and projectile vomitting
all over Bill's bedroom.

18:47.406 --> 18:49.391
A few things
which I totally dug about you.

18:49.511 --> 18:50.657
Was that me?

18:51.629 --> 18:52.999
Don't ever change.

18:53.119 --> 18:54.393
What the hell...

18:55.419 --> 18:57.122
- What?
- Shooting cock pain.

18:57.282 --> 18:58.957
I gotta go. Good to see you.

19:04.706 --> 19:05.716
My mama...

19:07.030 --> 19:08.241
What the fuck!

19:08.930 --> 19:12.081
I leave you alone for two seconds.
You're not supposed to do that.

19:12.201 --> 19:14.913
- Why not, daddy?
- You know why not.

19:15.634 --> 19:16.851
I know but...

19:17.440 --> 19:19.144
Just look how nice they look.

19:19.304 --> 19:22.781
- Pretty little maids all in a row.
- You wanna go back to promises?

19:29.430 --> 19:30.963
Don't you remember?

19:34.355 --> 19:36.305
How good the sex used to be...

19:37.308 --> 19:40.201
when I used to sprinkle it
on your naughty bits?

19:40.938 --> 19:44.893
I seem to recall something vaguely
pleasant about the sensation, yes.

19:58.852 --> 20:01.833
What do you know?
You're without the "artist within"?

20:01.953 --> 20:04.264
- You must be lonely.
- You must be jealous.

20:04.384 --> 20:05.924
That's kind of cute.

20:07.254 --> 20:08.304
We gotta go.

20:08.728 --> 20:09.465
Hank?

20:09.635 --> 20:10.797
I am so...

20:11.397 --> 20:13.808
touched
by what you did for me today.

20:19.434 --> 20:22.443
What I did for you today means that
I can't do this or anything like this

20:22.563 --> 20:24.996
- for the next 48 hours.
- Oh, yeah.

20:27.796 --> 20:30.367
There is more than one way
to skin a cat.

20:32.632 --> 20:33.952
I like you stoned.

20:34.205 --> 20:36.827
Do you?
I like you liking me stoned.

20:40.877 --> 20:42.752
- Holy shit.
- What?

20:43.632 --> 20:46.786
- I think you're giving me a boner.
- Well, that's great news.

20:46.906 --> 20:49.725
It's great news. No, it is. I just...
I'm afraid I might pop a stitch.

20:49.895 --> 20:51.762
- Come here!
- No, I wanna check it.

20:51.882 --> 20:53.128
I'll be right back.

20:53.298 --> 20:56.433
I don't want you to see him like this.
It could be bloody.

20:56.824 --> 20:58.274
What are you doing?

21:00.124 --> 21:01.702
Assuming the posish.

21:04.441 --> 21:06.268
Feel free to start without me.

21:11.885 --> 21:13.375
Hey, you got a rubber?

21:13.989 --> 21:16.657
I think I got the Ramses
in my wallet from high school

21:16.827 --> 21:19.283
- but I'm pretty sure it's expired.
- Hand it over.

21:19.453 --> 21:20.545
I was kidding.

21:20.715 --> 21:22.544
Fuckin chick is insisting I...

21:22.664 --> 21:24.531
- wear a rubber.
- What is that about?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.813
- It's not very Rock n' Roll.
- Not at all.

21:26.933 --> 21:29.341
If it's dark enough,
you could rip open an Alka-seltzer.

21:29.645 --> 21:31.895
- And bang her with it!
- No, it just

21:32.121 --> 21:34.713
It will create the illusion
that you're wearing a jimmy hat.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.621
David Coperfield does it.

21:36.791 --> 21:37.981
Not on stage.

21:38.762 --> 21:40.586
- Thanks, man.
- No, I was kidding.

22:52.617 --> 22:53.978
Hey, asshole!

22:57.572 --> 22:58.313
Hello?

22:59.299 --> 23:00.112
Karen?

23:06.183 --> 23:08.607
- Anybody got an Alka-seltzer?
- Lew!

23:10.022 --> 23:12.751
This fucking perv just tried
to mouthrape me.

23:13.472 --> 23:17.422
What the fuck dude? You're a guest
in my home and you go mouthrape...

23:18.445 --> 23:21.033
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Destiny.

23:21.751 --> 23:22.611
Felicity.

23:22.781 --> 23:24.820
Come on. There was no raping.

23:24.990 --> 23:27.292
I wasn't raping,
I'm not a rapy kind of guy.

23:29.682 --> 23:33.065
Karen, I was looking for you, there
you are. God, tell 'em I'm not rapy.

23:34.559 --> 23:36.668
I accidently went down on her.

23:36.908 --> 23:37.657
What?

23:37.872 --> 23:39.871
How do you accidently
go down on someone?

23:40.151 --> 23:41.463
Big house, lots of rooms.

23:41.633 --> 23:43.874
It was dark, I went to the bathroom,
I got turned around

23:43.994 --> 23:45.577
and accidently went down on her.

23:48.796 --> 23:49.987
I'll buy it.

23:50.436 --> 23:51.733
Sell it to her.

23:54.220 --> 23:57.155
So I seem to have procured
a lubricate prophylactic.

23:59.717 --> 24:01.141
I'll get the car.

24:06.326 --> 24:08.246
I know, I smell like pussy.

24:09.182 --> 24:12.898
I'm sorry Karen, I'm very sorry.
It was an honest mistake.

24:13.990 --> 24:16.623
You just had your mouth
on another woman's vagina.

24:16.793 --> 24:20.363
Yes I did. But the moment my tongue
hit clit, I knew it wasn't yours.

24:20.483 --> 24:21.679
It wasn't perfect.

24:21.799 --> 24:24.376
I could pick your pussy
out of a police line up of pussy.

24:24.496 --> 24:27.837
I could. You know, if your pussy
was ever arrested, God forbid,

24:28.007 --> 24:30.449
and it had to be identified
in some kind of a line up,

24:30.569 --> 24:33.502
I would get it right away.
"Pussy number two, step forward.

24:33.672 --> 24:34.793
"Turn profile.

24:35.582 --> 24:36.832
"That's Karen."

24:37.436 --> 24:42.173
My God. I must have been fucking crazy
thinking things could be different.

24:42.983 --> 24:43.919
Fuck me!

24:52.125 --> 24:54.659
Don't start saying things
you can't take back.

24:54.829 --> 24:56.598
I don't wanna take it back.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.391
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

24:58.511 --> 25:00.252
- You do.
- Don't tell me what I mean.

25:00.372 --> 25:02.422
- Good evening, sir, ma'am.
- Good evening.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.018
You know why I stopped you?

25:04.138 --> 25:06.099
No I don't, sir. Educate me,

25:06.457 --> 25:07.443
officer...

25:08.551 --> 25:10.245
Dick? Really?

25:11.402 --> 25:12.510
Officer Dick.

25:12.630 --> 25:15.152
And that was mean by the way.
That was really a low blow.

25:15.272 --> 25:17.322
Coming from the "mouth rapist"?

25:17.532 --> 25:19.039
You have a headlight out.

25:19.159 --> 25:21.710
Yes, it's been that way for months.
But tonight I get stopped,

25:21.883 --> 25:23.942
of all nights.
It's just my fucking luck.

25:24.062 --> 25:25.985
'Cause this is all about luck.
It hasn't...

25:26.105 --> 25:28.168
Could we just sleep on this?

25:28.288 --> 25:30.689
Is there a reason why
you're not wearing a shirt, sir?

25:30.859 --> 25:33.105
Yes, there is, officer.

25:33.225 --> 25:35.852
There's a very good one
and I couldn't even begin to explain.

25:35.972 --> 25:37.273
Oh, no! Try.

25:37.393 --> 25:39.951
Try see if he thinks
it was an honest mistake.

25:40.071 --> 25:42.099
Okay. One more time
for the Cheap Seats.

25:42.219 --> 25:44.553
What happened back there
could've happened to anybody.

25:44.673 --> 25:47.799
Wrong place, wrong time,
wrong vagina.

25:47.959 --> 25:48.924
Shut up!

25:49.044 --> 25:52.488
- I'm sorry, he's been drinking.
- What the fuck, Karen?

25:54.083 --> 25:56.744
- Have you been drinking, sir?
- Hours ago...

25:57.331 --> 26:00.436
you know, but not to excess,
I don't do that anymore.

26:00.556 --> 26:03.348
I mean I do. But not nearly
as often as I used to.

26:03.652 --> 26:05.618
And he's been taking Vicodin.

26:05.827 --> 26:06.917
Oh, come on!

26:07.580 --> 26:08.930
That's... Karen...

26:10.216 --> 26:12.941
I know you're pissed at me
for going down on that woman,

26:13.293 --> 26:16.948
but are you trying
to get me thrown in jail?

26:17.118 --> 26:20.006
- Could you step out of the car, please?
- Hold on, sir. You know there's...

26:20.126 --> 26:23.188
- Out of the car now.
- You caught us at a really bad time.

26:23.308 --> 26:26.372
- Yeah, it's a bad time.
- Excuse me for saying so, ma'am.

26:26.492 --> 26:28.779
You don't have to put up
with this kind of behavior.

26:28.899 --> 26:31.245
Why don't you just mind
your own fucking business?

26:31.365 --> 26:33.374
- Hank, just shut up.
- Excuse me, sir?

26:33.494 --> 26:36.235
All due respect but aren't you stepping
outside the job description?

26:36.355 --> 26:38.620
I didn't know you guys had the right
to editorialize.

26:41.807 --> 26:44.005
Have you been smoking marijuana, sir?

26:45.536 --> 26:46.583
One hit.

26:46.926 --> 26:48.251
- One!
- Okay, let's go.

26:48.371 --> 26:50.530
Come on, you can't arrest somebody
for being a wiseass.

26:50.650 --> 26:53.552
No but I certainly can
for driving under the influence, can I?

26:53.672 --> 26:55.331
Officer, excuse me.

26:55.451 --> 26:58.382
This is just like
a big misunderstanding.

26:58.502 --> 26:59.701
Of course it is. OK?

26:59.821 --> 27:01.988
You know,
the thing that I can't understand

27:02.108 --> 27:03.675
is what a woman like that

27:03.835 --> 27:07.387
is doing with a prick, like you.
She's got to have screw loose right?

27:07.668 --> 27:10.015
Maybe that's how you like 'em,
right a little crazy.

27:10.503 --> 27:13.502
Maybe if you go down on her
a little more often.

27:15.341 --> 27:16.258
What the f...

27:29.611 --> 27:30.830
Not the balls!
