WEBVTT

00:34.904 --> 00:36.384
Josie?

00:36.427 --> 00:38.081
God, you scared me.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.649
I'm sorry, I just wanted to make
sure that you were okay.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.260
Why?

00:43.304 --> 00:45.262
I don't know.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.917
I guess I've just been
thinking about you.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.615
You have?

00:50.659 --> 00:53.618
Actually, I can't stop
thinking about you.

00:57.405 --> 01:00.408
I've been thinking
about you, too.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.863
DARK JOSIE:
It's past curfew.

01:24.127 --> 01:27.391
And Dad's gonna be so pissed.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.879
You were having a sex dream.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.751
What? No, I wasn't.

01:39.795 --> 01:42.624
Please tell me it wasn't Landon.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.668
Or Hope,

01:43.712 --> 01:45.235
for that matter.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.237
I wasn't having a sex dream.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.283
Go back to sleep.

02:08.171 --> 02:10.173
EMMA:
As supernaturals,

02:10.217 --> 02:12.132
we all carry a burden.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.527
Our eyes are open to evil.

02:24.579 --> 02:27.582
And recently,
you've had to face it.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.542
Some of us process these traumas

02:31.586 --> 02:33.196
by suppressing what happened.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.460
For others, it's easier
to bury it deep inside

02:36.504 --> 02:39.898
and pretend like
nothing's happened at all.

02:39.942 --> 02:43.337
Still, others may take
a different route, such as...

02:43.380 --> 02:48.516
HOPE:
Pushing people away
in an attempt to self-isolate?

02:48.559 --> 02:51.736
Because everyone they love
is in perpetual danger,

02:51.780 --> 02:54.304
which often results in them
becoming perpetually dead.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.653
See? There.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.394
That's it.
That's my therapy.

02:57.438 --> 03:00.832
Can I go now? Because, uh,
Landon's outside trying to fly

03:00.876 --> 03:02.660
and could use
a spotter.I'm afraid not, Hope,

03:02.704 --> 03:05.402
because the point is
we can all do better

03:05.446 --> 03:07.535
at processing the traumas
we've been through.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.537
Which is why Dr. Saltzman
has asked me to conduct

03:09.580 --> 03:10.668
a special group lesson today.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.192
Hmm? Mm-mm.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.891
I, for one,
could really use this,

03:15.934 --> 03:18.502
and I would appreciate
everyone's support.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.200
MG:
Honestly,
I don't know

03:20.243 --> 03:23.203
why I'm here, but
I'm down to help.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.769
EMMA:
You will all

03:24.813 --> 03:27.207
have an important role to play
in this simulation.

03:28.556 --> 03:29.905
Oh, stop looking
at me like that.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.950
It'll be fun.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.867
This device

03:35.911 --> 03:38.130
was created
by Professor Rupert Vardemus.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.262
Ew.
Okay...

03:39.306 --> 03:41.569
The realProfessor Vardemus.

03:41.612 --> 03:44.702
He's quite famous
in mystical therapeutic circles.

03:44.746 --> 03:47.966
It's his variation
on a Chambre de Chasse.

03:48.010 --> 03:50.795
All your psychological concerns
will be transferred inside

03:50.839 --> 03:52.623
to form a shared narrative.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.930
Now, the world you create
together can be anything,

03:54.973 --> 03:58.542
from pirates on the high seas
to spies in the Cold War.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.936
But no matter what it ends up
looking like,

04:00.979 --> 04:04.244
it will be designed specifically
to help you.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.071
Out here, you're unconscious.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.639
You'll have no awareness
that you're in a simulation.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.729
So, it's like a game?

04:11.773 --> 04:12.904
Mm.

04:12.948 --> 04:15.298
Uh, how do I win?Simply reach

04:15.342 --> 04:17.735
the end of your story and you'll
be given an escape word.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.085
Say it aloud and you'll become
self-aware again,

04:20.129 --> 04:21.826
then wake up here,

04:21.870 --> 04:25.308
having discovered something
valuable in the process.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.092
Any questions?LIZZIE:
Uh, yeah.

04:27.136 --> 04:31.488
I have a question.
What the hell is she doing here?

04:35.144 --> 04:37.277
Hi. Uh, sorry I'm late.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.018
Uh, weird dreams.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.498
EMMA:
You're just
in time, Jade.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.761
Don't worry.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.198
What we're about to do here
is merely a simulation.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.939
And I'll be in it
as well,

04:47.983 --> 04:49.419
and self-aware the whole time.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.856
I promise to keep a careful eye
on all of you.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.599
LIZZIE:
Everyone think

04:55.643 --> 04:59.342
of bright, sunny,
tropical beaches.

05:04.391 --> 05:08.656
MG:
The air was as cold
as a kiss from a corpse.

05:08.699 --> 05:12.790
My partner worked at night,
and now, so did I.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.793
I had to, if I was
ever going to find him.

05:15.837 --> 05:19.319
But on the bright side, at least I knew where to start.

05:19.362 --> 05:22.887
Because there's one thing that everyone in Mystic Falls knows.

05:22.931 --> 05:25.977
There's a place
where the lost things go.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.847
I'm in town to make
a picture, Jo.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.197
The more publicity, the better.

06:12.241 --> 06:13.764
As your sister,
but more importantly,

06:13.808 --> 06:15.200
your publicist, I disagree.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.377
We need to control
the narrative.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.204
Because if you still looked good
from that angle,

06:19.248 --> 06:20.989
we'd be working
with Howard Hawks.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.557
Fine.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.385

06:59.375 --> 07:01.899
I'll be taking a
break, but don't worry,

07:01.943 --> 07:07.035
I'll be here all night,
if anyone needs my help.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.263
This ain't a peep show.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.961
Can you blame me?

07:20.004 --> 07:22.964
Elizabeth Saltzman's a star.
I've seen all of her movies.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.836
I'm bad with faces.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.665
I'm hoping that's not the case.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.101
I'm looking for my boss,

07:30.145 --> 07:31.755
the best P.I.
this town's ever known.

07:31.799 --> 07:36.325
Like I said, I'm bad with faces.

07:37.413 --> 07:40.155
He's in danger, Miss Mikaelson.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.592
How do you know my name?

07:42.636 --> 07:44.681
The same way I know
your liquor license is expired.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.291
So,

07:46.335 --> 07:48.119
let's help each other out.

07:48.163 --> 07:52.384
He looks like the kind of guy
who comes here for the music.

07:52.428 --> 07:53.777
If I were you,

07:53.821 --> 07:57.868
I'd ask the dame who sings,
because I don't.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.874
Miss Tig?

08:07.182 --> 08:08.618
I'd like to
have a quick...

08:08.662 --> 08:10.185
word.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.757
Vardemus.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.720
My name is Holmes, dear boy.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.766
Sherlock Holmes.

08:42.739 --> 08:45.220
How is this possible?

08:54.708 --> 08:57.014
Good morning.

08:57.058 --> 08:59.582
You sobered up yet?

08:59.626 --> 09:01.192
I rarely drink.

09:01.236 --> 09:04.761
The occasional seven percent
solution, perhaps.

09:04.805 --> 09:07.938
You're an alcoholic, Rupert.

09:07.982 --> 09:11.899
We're partners. Friends.

09:11.942 --> 09:15.555
That explains the cufflinks
you bought for me.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.252
For the last time!

09:17.295 --> 09:18.949
My partner's name is Watson
and mine is...

09:18.993 --> 09:20.211
Sherlock Holmes.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.126
I know.

09:25.129 --> 09:29.220
Though how I ended up
here confounds even me.

09:29.264 --> 09:32.049
I woke this morning and the
world around me had changed.

09:32.093 --> 09:35.618
But though my surroundings
were different, I remembered

09:35.662 --> 09:37.054
the case I was working on.

09:37.098 --> 09:40.928
What I was looking for:
the Blue Carbuncle,

09:40.971 --> 09:43.408
a rare and
precious gemstone,

09:43.452 --> 09:46.063
stolen from the
countess of Morcar.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.892
So you can imagine my surprise
when it turned up

09:48.936 --> 09:52.069
in a newspaper advertisement
for this dreary world,

09:52.113 --> 09:53.941
around the neck
of a lounge singer.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.944
A dead lounge singer, with
your fingerprints all over her.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.599
I doubt that very much,

09:59.642 --> 10:02.993
as should you,
given I was wearing gloves.

10:05.474 --> 10:06.780
Have you deduced

10:06.823 --> 10:09.478
that she died
of cyanide poisoning yet?

10:11.698 --> 10:12.829
The champagne?

10:12.873 --> 10:14.657
It's elementary.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.747
The skin beneath her fingernails
had turned the color of roses.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.271
A direct result of her cells
being unable to absorb

10:20.315 --> 10:22.926
the oxygen that remained
in her blood.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.625
Find who poisoned the bottle...

10:27.844 --> 10:30.455
...and you'll have
found your killer.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.457
I'm the sidekick.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.634
You are the brains,
which is why I need your help

10:34.677 --> 10:36.984
to get to the bottom of this.Sorry, old chap.

10:37.027 --> 10:39.943
I have my own mystery to solve.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.076
James Ryder stole
the jewel.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.035
The hotel attendant?

10:45.079 --> 10:47.298
A bold theory.
How did you arrive at it?

10:47.342 --> 10:49.866
I didn't. You did.

10:56.177 --> 10:58.788
So read up, and hopefully
by the time I'm back,

10:58.832 --> 11:00.834
you'll be the man
I know again.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.852
How did you get in?

11:18.895 --> 11:20.331
The door was unlocked.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.857
You're a terrible liar.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.163
I'm a terrible
detective, too.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.557
But not half bad
at picking locks.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.994
Then that'll be the first
thing I tell the cops.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.693
Or should I start with you
going to talk to that singer

11:33.736 --> 11:35.695
right before she died?

11:37.087 --> 11:39.742
Not like they'd care anyway.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.831
Whiskey.

11:41.875 --> 11:45.139
Preferably the good stuff.
Not that rotgut.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.448
I keep it in the back.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.261
MAN: Cut!

12:26.267 --> 12:29.879
I'd like to try one more.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.403
Oh, you want to start
tryingnow, Bob?

12:32.447 --> 12:34.188
I'll be in my trailer.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.410
That was...Trash.

12:39.454 --> 12:42.457
Like the rest of
this stupid horror flick.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.246
I get murdered by
a mer-man.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.640
A mer-man!Honestly, no one's
gonna watch this crap.

12:51.683 --> 12:54.512
Ooh. Out of my way,
you trollops.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.645
Where is my flask?

12:56.688 --> 12:59.343
Never mind that, he's back.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.609
How do I look?

13:04.653 --> 13:05.785
Doesn't matter, 'cause
these photos are never

13:05.828 --> 13:07.395
seeing the light of day.

13:09.745 --> 13:12.139
You look beautiful,
Miss Saltzman.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.532
Can I ask you
a few questions?

13:14.576 --> 13:17.666
You a reporter?

13:17.709 --> 13:19.973
Not exactly.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.714
But I do have something
to report.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.674
Someone's trying
to kill you.

13:26.762 --> 13:27.807
Oh...

13:27.850 --> 13:30.810
Cigarettes kill people, too.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.681
I'd never smoked
a day in my life,

13:32.724 --> 13:35.466
but in that moment,
I understood the urge

13:35.510 --> 13:38.643
to put your lips on something
you knew was bad for you.

13:38.687 --> 13:41.124
Thank you.
I'm sorry.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.734
I'm still a little
shaken up.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.824
That's understandable.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.130
As I was saying,
poisoned champagne was sent

13:47.174 --> 13:48.566
to your table last night.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.134
Lucky for you, it ended up
on the wrong lips.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.136
Any idea who would
want you dead?

13:53.180 --> 13:57.227
None. I'm just
a washed-up actress.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.316
I can't imagine anyone
caring enough about me

13:59.360 --> 14:02.537
to send champagne,
much less kill me.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.848
Please, Mr. Greasley,

14:08.891 --> 14:12.764
as messed up as my life is,
I don't want to die.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.157
You won't.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.507
I promise.
My partner's a genius.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.379
He'll crack this case, and...

14:20.555 --> 14:22.078
For what it's worth,
I don't think

14:22.122 --> 14:24.037
you're washed up,
Miss Saltzman.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.521
Please, call me...

14:30.565 --> 14:31.827
Lizzie.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.266
I found out who that
photographer works for.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.965
And who the hell are you?

14:44.231 --> 14:46.233
Just a fan.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.196
VARDEMUS:
Well, I'll be damned.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.896
It wasthe hotel attendant.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.771
"Liquet."

15:08.255 --> 15:09.952
That was the end
of my game.

15:09.996 --> 15:13.956
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.479
I'm Rupert Vardemus.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.874
And I'm not a detective,
I'm a professor.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.574
Is that you, Milton?

15:23.618 --> 15:27.056
I know this must be all
very confusing.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.929
I remember your name
from the school dossiers.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.582
I remember everything.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.454
In fact, thanks to--

15:35.282 --> 15:36.936
You!

15:39.112 --> 15:41.592
This doesn't make any sense.

15:41.636 --> 15:44.073
One of them should
be awake by now.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.210
Dissero.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.434
Professor Vardemus.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.958
How?

15:59.001 --> 16:02.526
That pustule Clarke
locked my body in here.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.964
But not before he locked
my mind away in that box.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.794
Wait, you were
in the game, too.

16:09.838 --> 16:12.014
I was murdered by
one of your students.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.450
Like you.

16:13.494 --> 16:15.626
Then that settles it.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.846
We have to end
the simulation.

16:17.889 --> 16:21.371
You'd be doing them
more harm than good.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.721
While what they're
experiencing is merely

16:23.765 --> 16:25.375
a manifestation
of their minds,

16:25.419 --> 16:28.465
a narrative involving murder
is still a serious matter.

16:28.509 --> 16:31.468
It points to someone
inside the game

16:31.512 --> 16:34.167
being on the verge
of a psychological break.

16:35.864 --> 16:39.302
Terminate the session now, and
you may cement that fracture.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.738
So what are we supposed to do?

16:42.523 --> 16:45.352
The hardest thing of all.

16:47.180 --> 16:50.922
Trust them to resolve
the issue without us.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.620
Do you know who killed you?

17:32.268 --> 17:35.880
Well, well, what's
a classy broad like you

17:35.924 --> 17:37.404
doing in this gin joint?

17:37.447 --> 17:39.536
Being blackmailed, but you
already knew that, Jade.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.060
So cut to the chase
and name your price

17:41.103 --> 17:42.539
for those photos of my sister.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.063
This isn't about money.

17:44.106 --> 17:47.718
It's about the best story
of my career.

17:47.762 --> 17:50.895
A fading starlet can't get
hired in the movies anymore.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.549
But lucky for her,

17:52.593 --> 17:54.943
she's got a twin sister
who left everything behind

17:54.986 --> 17:56.640
to become her publicist.

17:56.684 --> 18:00.427
One that knows exactly how to
get her back into the spotlight.

18:00.470 --> 18:03.430
Even if it means making her
the target of a murderer.

18:05.345 --> 18:08.565
How am I doing so far?

18:08.609 --> 18:10.089
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.830
Said the sister/publicist
to the reporter.

18:12.874 --> 18:15.659
But she was missing
an important fact.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.966
The reporter knew her tell.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.142
She had a habit of
picking off her nail polish

18:20.186 --> 18:22.927
when she was lying.

18:22.971 --> 18:23.928
How did you know?

18:23.972 --> 18:25.756
I figured it out
the hard way.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.237
You were picking at your nails
the night you walked out on me,

18:28.281 --> 18:29.456
saying you'd be back.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.762
That isn't what I meant.I know.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.025
I bribed a waiter
at the club,

18:34.069 --> 18:36.245
and he told me that
you were the one

18:36.289 --> 18:38.247
that bought that champagne
that killed that singer.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.771
Cyanide poisoning.

18:40.815 --> 18:44.035
I bribed the coroner as well.It was an accident.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.646
Lizzie was supposed to be
rushed to the hospital

18:45.689 --> 18:47.256
to get some press
for her movie.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.606
I didn't use enough poison
to kill anyone.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.521
I don't even know how
that singer got that bottle.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.132
All that matters is that
she's dead.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.785
And putting you behind bars
is the only way

18:54.829 --> 18:56.700
I'll ever pry you
out of your sister's claws.

18:56.744 --> 18:57.832
Wait.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.619
Have one last drink with me.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.143
for old time's sake.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.333
Too late, Jose.

19:20.376 --> 19:21.812
Maybe it's the booze talking,

19:21.856 --> 19:23.510
but I just had to see you
one last time.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.690
Excuse me.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.743
MG:
Josette Saltzman.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.658
I think we both know
there's no need

19:41.702 --> 19:43.834
to check her for a pulse.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.663
JADE:
Trust me, I am totally
self-aware.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.709
I didn't need your stupid game

19:48.752 --> 19:50.580
to tell me I have the hots
for Josie Saltzman.

19:50.624 --> 19:53.235
All right? I've known that since
I saw her in the prison world.

19:53.279 --> 19:57.021
If Jade was ejected
from the simulation prematurely,

19:57.065 --> 19:58.632
it means the rules have changed.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.377
Someone's rewriting them

20:04.420 --> 20:07.118
from inside the game itself.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.210
How? Who?

20:11.253 --> 20:14.561
Someone with access
to very powerful magic...

20:14.604 --> 20:16.258
who needs everyone
out of the way

20:16.302 --> 20:18.042
so they can get whatever
it is they want.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.740
In short,

20:19.783 --> 20:22.221
the person who killed us all.

20:22.264 --> 20:26.573
So, the question we should
be asking ourselves is...

20:28.270 --> 20:30.098
...why they did it.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.894
I heard about your reporter.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.722
The cops know who killed her?

20:45.766 --> 20:47.550
Same person who
murdered your singer.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.552
But I don't think they're
too interested in

20:49.596 --> 20:52.163
figuring out who that is.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.730
Wish I could have
done more for her.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.906
You were in here that night
taking photos.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.908
You want to help?

20:57.952 --> 21:00.781
Develop that film and take
a hard look at whatever you see.

21:03.784 --> 21:06.613
Sorry. It's none
of my business.

21:13.315 --> 21:16.666
I still talk
to Landon, you know.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.016
How is he?He's good.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.323
Promotion in California
is going good for him.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.194
Hmm.

21:23.238 --> 21:24.587
But he still misses you, Hope.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.285
He's the one who left.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.112
Because you didn't go with him.

21:28.156 --> 21:31.115
But you can change that
with a phone call.

21:31.159 --> 21:32.769
He'd buy you a bus
ticket tomorrow.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.858
I can buy my own ticket.

21:34.902 --> 21:38.471
And you can
develop those photos.

21:44.259 --> 21:47.306
MG:
You sure you don't have
anything else to say?

21:47.349 --> 21:51.005
Confessions usually include
why you did the crime.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.615
Does it matter?

21:52.659 --> 21:54.443
Of course it does.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.445
You sign that line and the next
chair you'll be sitting in

21:56.489 --> 21:57.794
is gonna plug into the wall.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.537
Look on the bright side.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.800
They'll give you a medal
when I ride the lightning.

22:03.844 --> 22:06.237
Medals are for heroes.

22:08.239 --> 22:11.678
I'm just a guy trying to figure
out who poisoned his partner.

22:13.506 --> 22:17.640
I already told you, it was me.

22:17.684 --> 22:19.381
I poisoned your partner

22:19.425 --> 22:21.557
and that singer

22:21.601 --> 22:23.820
and Jade.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.866
Now take me down to the station.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.914
I can't do that.

22:32.089 --> 22:33.395
And why the hell not?

22:33.439 --> 22:34.657
Because my partner was shot.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.834
You didn't kill
anyone, Josette.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.836
But it had to be me.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.839
The pieces don't fit.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.580
So why are you trying
to make them?

22:44.624 --> 22:47.017
Because if it wasn't me,
it was Lizzie.

22:47.061 --> 22:52.371
And if one of us has to die,
I'd rather it be me.

22:52.414 --> 22:54.329
Do you see that?

22:56.592 --> 22:59.073
"Praesidio."

23:01.162 --> 23:03.120
MG.
MG:
I wanted to tell her

23:03.164 --> 23:05.558
that I saw something
on that piece of paper,

23:05.601 --> 23:07.037
but it's like they say...

23:09.170 --> 23:11.912
...dead men tell no tales.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.831
Don't do this. I won't let you.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.984
MG:
Always thought
you were a hell of an actress...

23:42.464 --> 23:44.248
Is that you, Bob?

23:44.292 --> 23:46.425
My contract explicitly says

23:46.468 --> 23:49.602
that I don't have to talk
to you after we wrap.

23:49.645 --> 23:54.650
...but being the Mystic Mauler
is going to be your last role.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.963
What the hell
are you talking about?

24:03.006 --> 24:05.487
Drop the act. Why'd you do it?

24:05.531 --> 24:07.097
Do what?

24:07.141 --> 24:10.492
Murder all those people.
Maybe start with your sister.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.934
Josie's dead?

24:17.978 --> 24:22.635
I should be, too. But lucky me,
I had this in my pocket.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.767
It's your flask, right?

24:24.811 --> 24:26.116
The one you poisoned
the singer with,

24:26.160 --> 24:27.944
the one that started
this whole mess?

24:27.988 --> 24:31.600
Like I said,
you're a hell of an actress.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.820
So those crocodile tears won't
stop me from bringing you in.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.477
For once,
I don't care about myself.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.826
I didn't do what
you said, but...

24:41.654 --> 24:44.831
I may as well have, because
I was so wrapped up in myself

24:44.874 --> 24:47.355
that I didn't know
my sister was in danger.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.881
I wasn't there to save her.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.586
"Caecus."

25:02.065 --> 25:04.024
Thank God.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.809
Oh, that's my escape word.

25:06.853 --> 25:09.377
Which means none
of this is real,

25:09.420 --> 25:13.642
Josie's still alive and I can
finally leave this stupid game.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.428
Okay, Emma. I'm ready.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.561
Yank me out.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.737
Abracadabra or whatever.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.002
Son of a bitch.
Why isn't it working?

25:26.046 --> 25:27.526
You're cracking up,
Miss Saltzman.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.658
Don't you label me
insane again, okay?

25:29.702 --> 25:32.748
I am the only person here
who is in their right mind.

25:32.792 --> 25:35.272
We just need to find
you your escape word.

25:36.491 --> 25:37.884
Save it for the judge.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.234
Oh. Yeah,
that's-that's good, MG.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.453
My name's Milton.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.281
I know, okay?

25:44.325 --> 25:47.284
I know you as well as anyone,
Milton Greasley.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.591
Look, I'm not
proud of this,

25:49.635 --> 25:52.028
but I'm kind of,
like, your blind spot.

25:52.072 --> 25:55.205
You are so into me that you'll
sort of do whatever I say,

25:55.249 --> 25:56.859
so slap those puppies
on me and maybe

25:56.903 --> 25:58.252
you'll get over your block.

25:59.906 --> 26:05.302
Or we could run away together.

26:05.346 --> 26:08.262
Maybe to a
real beach.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.264
Mexico.

26:10.307 --> 26:12.396
The cops will never find us.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.443
Is this a serious offer?

26:15.486 --> 26:17.750
Hell no. But the fact that
you're convinced I'm a killer

26:17.793 --> 26:20.622
and you still considered it
totally proves my point.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.276
Now Fifty Shadesme.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.766
"Heros."

26:37.117 --> 26:39.075
Lizzie.

26:39.119 --> 26:41.425
I remember.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.645
Then why are we still
trapped here?

26:43.689 --> 26:45.255
This is maddening.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.648
Get these stupid cuffs off me.

26:46.692 --> 26:50.173
There's something wrong
with the game.

26:56.484 --> 26:59.618
Lizzie, run.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.097
Find Hope.

27:01.141 --> 27:03.012
Oh, crap.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.675
Ms. Tig.

27:13.719 --> 27:17.853
Lizzie, she-she got
her escape word, but she's still

27:17.897 --> 27:19.289
in the game.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.595
And...

27:21.683 --> 27:24.294
...Josie died.

27:24.338 --> 27:27.515
I saw it.
So why is she still in there?

27:39.048 --> 27:40.702
We're closed.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.313
Hope Andrea Mikaelson!

27:43.357 --> 27:45.533
Open this damn door!

27:45.576 --> 27:47.056
Someone's trying to kill me!

27:49.363 --> 27:50.669
You're that movie star.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.061
How do you know my name?It's a long story.

27:52.105 --> 27:53.672
Which you won't believe.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.674
But, um, oh,
I can prove it.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.197
I know your deep, dark damage.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.677
You don't get close to people

27:58.720 --> 28:01.070
because they leave you
or die, right?

28:01.114 --> 28:02.419
Well, that's exactly
what's gonna happen

28:02.463 --> 28:03.682
if you don't
let me in.

28:03.725 --> 28:06.641
So, please, help me help you.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.078
You're right.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.211
I've spent my whole life
pushing people away.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.822
And I'm about to change that

28:13.866 --> 28:15.519
by going after the man
that I love.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.521
So, sorry, but I
have a bus to catch.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.697
No, no, no.
Hope, Hope, Hope, Hope.

28:47.595 --> 28:50.032
"Mortem."

29:00.651 --> 29:02.566
Rafael.

29:02.610 --> 29:03.567
It's okay.

29:03.611 --> 29:04.873
You're back.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.267
What happened
in there?

29:07.310 --> 29:09.095
Did you have a breakthrough?

29:09.138 --> 29:12.011
Or did the killer
get to you, too?

29:13.969 --> 29:15.971
I don't know.

29:22.282 --> 29:26.242
A little on the nose,
don't you think?

29:35.512 --> 29:37.688
Hello, sister.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.128
Don't look so shocked.

29:42.171 --> 29:45.784
One of us was always
going to become a killer.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.960
Because of the Merge.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.486
That's what this whole thing
has been about.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.836
I made it that way.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.797
Remove everyone
until it was just you and me.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.320
Even then,
Josie was still willing

30:00.363 --> 30:02.104
to take the fall to let you win.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.715
Ironic, isn't it?

30:04.759 --> 30:08.850
I had to kill Josie
so that she could survive.

30:12.027 --> 30:14.203
I am her, too, of course.

30:14.247 --> 30:16.815
The parts of her she
keeps buried inside.

30:16.858 --> 30:21.471
That resent her and you
for making her weak.

30:21.515 --> 30:25.040
Mixed in with a little
dark magic.

30:25.084 --> 30:29.479
Enough to rewrite the rules

30:29.523 --> 30:33.701
and show you that I'm stronger
than you can ever be.

30:35.703 --> 30:38.880
I didn't have to play
any game to know that.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.188
You always have been.

30:44.451 --> 30:48.716
So what? Are you just
gonna kill me now?

30:51.893 --> 30:54.330
We both knew
it would come to this.

30:54.374 --> 30:55.984
Fine.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.899
Then you win.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.683
I'm done with
this stupid simulation.

31:00.946 --> 31:04.166
You're not going anywhere.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.864
I rewrote the rules,

31:05.907 --> 31:07.691
remember?

31:07.735 --> 31:10.346
So I pull this trigger,
and your mind is stuck here

31:10.390 --> 31:12.522
while your body waits
for me to absorb it

31:12.566 --> 31:14.698
during the Merge
in the real world.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.700
Josie, please.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.702
I-I know I don't do

31:18.746 --> 31:20.748
a good job
of showing it, but...

31:20.791 --> 31:24.447
I love you,
even more than I love myself.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.058
So don't do this.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.277
Hmm.

31:28.321 --> 31:31.237
Sorry, sis. It's you or me.

31:33.065 --> 31:36.372
And there's no fighting fate.

32:01.702 --> 32:04.400
I thought you had
a bus to catch.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.925
I want to be with
the man that I love

32:06.968 --> 32:07.969
more than I
want anything.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.449
But I couldn't get on that bus

32:09.492 --> 32:12.234
if it meant an innocent person
had to die.

32:12.278 --> 32:16.108
That is such
a Hope move.

32:18.458 --> 32:23.245
Let me guess.
You're seeing a word right now.

32:23.289 --> 32:24.594
Yes. What does it mean?

32:24.638 --> 32:25.987
Say the word,

32:26.031 --> 32:28.163
and I will tell you
in the real world.

32:29.556 --> 32:30.992
Fatum.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.447
EMMA:
Oh, thank God.

32:51.491 --> 32:54.537
I was beginning to think
I'd need therapy myself.

33:02.023 --> 33:06.201
Now, um...
what are we gonna do about Jo?

33:17.865 --> 33:19.345
I've had enough make-believe
for one day.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.825
So what the hell
is all this?

33:21.869 --> 33:24.393
This is research.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.221
What you told me
about Josie's alter ego

33:26.265 --> 33:28.310
sounds straight
out of a comic book,

33:28.354 --> 33:31.574
which is way more my genre
than film noir.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.490
So I've just been
searching for a way

33:34.534 --> 33:36.188
to help her after she wakes up.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.366

33:40.409 --> 33:42.672

I wouldn't have gotten out
