03:51.450 --> 03:52.450
Han!

03:53.955 --> 03:56.435
Hello man.
Welcome to the D.R.

03:57.092 --> 03:58.603
Put your suitcase in back here.

05:36.334 --> 05:37.419
'Sup Boss!

05:39.824 --> 05:40.870
I bring you something.

06:00.540 --> 06:03.214
Can you explain to me
who is the Chinese guy?

06:03.657 --> 06:05.513
Looks like you have been really
moving up in the world.

06:07.583 --> 06:08.736
Who's this guy?

06:19.161 --> 06:21.361
Santo, Han.
Han, Santo.

06:24.644 --> 06:27.491
- You look like shit.
- That is a lot coming from you.

06:28.728 --> 06:30.506
How come we can't stay in a hotel, huh?

06:30.653 --> 06:32.626
Oh, complaining already!

06:32.720 --> 06:35.419
I like air-conditioning, you know?
And room service.

06:35.494 --> 06:37.315
- So, you guys love each other.
- With TV!

07:06.000 --> 07:07.381
Dig in.

07:24.372 --> 07:26.561
Welcome to our island, Han.

07:26.944 --> 07:28.992
Island in paradise.

07:35.384 --> 07:37.506
Tonight we go speak to Elvis.

07:38.482 --> 07:40.230
See if we can fix this problem.

07:40.301 --> 07:43.542
- First we pick up Leo.
- Leo?

07:49.651 --> 07:53.069
So where are we actually picking
up this Leo friend of yours?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.172
Prison.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.309
Yo! My God!
Move! Move, man!

08:12.246 --> 08:14.781
And that's why you're
always impressive man.

08:21.978 --> 08:24.520
- Hey where you going?
- I'll be back, one second.

08:25.896 --> 08:28.957
Or you could drive around the corner.
Park and come through the front.

08:58.293 --> 08:59.293
Hey.

08:59.493 --> 09:01.985
Wait, wait.
I ain't goin' out there like this.

09:04.007 --> 09:05.168
Do you wanna wear my shirt?

09:05.317 --> 09:07.062
No man. I got it covered, man.

09:07.070 --> 09:08.692
Somebody's coming to bring my shit.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.480
Don't worry.
I got it covered.

09:11.666 --> 09:12.928
Who is this guy we're meeting?

09:13.129 --> 09:16.709
Elvis.
He's a politician who gives a fuck about the people.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.596
Beautiful.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.982
Hey Han.
I bet this is a lot different than China.

10:06.017 --> 10:09.029
- Never been.
- Or Japan, wherever you're from.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.856
Like I said I never been
east of the Altlantic.

10:12.857 --> 10:15.190
- He asked you where you're from.
- States.

10:15.194 --> 10:18.145
- Is that where you met Dom?
- Nah, I met him in Mexico.

10:18.261 --> 10:22.196
Used to hear about him in the racing scene.
But didn't start running with him until then.

10:23.294 --> 10:25.960
And?  You guys are hungry?
Or you want me to get you guys a room?

10:29.861 --> 10:33.657
That's cool.
So you've been running with him for a while?

10:34.175 --> 10:38.816
Hey you know.  Here and there.
South America.  Tells me for all the fun stuff.

10:38.841 --> 10:40.041
Wow.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.374
Leo.
Have a seat.

10:51.340 --> 10:53.950
- Hello.
- How you doing my friend?

10:55.530 --> 10:57.413
Well this is the guy I was telling you about.

10:57.928 --> 11:00.386
This meeting gonna be good.
For the island.

11:00.421 --> 11:05.779
Well you know, my friend that I don't
like having unexpected guest.

11:05.814 --> 11:07.632
I already got my crew here.

11:15.293 --> 11:17.787
He knows how I like to do business.

11:17.997 --> 11:19.746
Now, I tell you why.

11:20.465 --> 11:24.548
When the merchandise gets here...
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

11:30.945 --> 11:33.244
Like I was saying my friend.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.871
I'll protect the merchandise
until it's out of the port.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.070
Once it gets out...

11:39.168 --> 11:42.902
If you wanna do something freaky
that's none of my business.

11:44.142 --> 11:45.261
Okay.

11:46.970 --> 11:48.663
Between the arrival...

11:50.681 --> 11:52.221
and its destination...

11:56.493 --> 11:59.589
there's a very slight window open.

11:59.624 --> 12:01.113
Yeah, don't worry about that.

12:05.950 --> 12:09.141
You know at the end of the day people
are gonna get what they need.

12:11.771 --> 12:14.107
You can't move forward without fuel.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.241
And no one wants to be left behind.

12:20.449 --> 12:23.072
She can get it and give it to the people.

12:27.097 --> 12:28.297
God bless.

12:42.274 --> 12:43.908
Here baby, I got you a beer.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.808
It ain't that hard to track you down.
All I gotta do is follow the odor of skanks.

13:08.305 --> 13:09.449
Letty.

13:12.378 --> 13:14.809
Life has a way of changing those plans.

13:18.450 --> 13:20.061
Change of plans.

13:22.377 --> 13:23.750
Where do we sleep?

13:27.485 --> 13:29.180
Excuse me ladies.

13:39.422 --> 13:41.990
That's right.
All the way from Mexico, sucker.

14:34.424 --> 14:35.371
What?

14:36.680 --> 14:37.842
Who is this?

14:39.099 --> 14:42.432
Did I just hear you speaking Dominican?

14:42.573 --> 14:45.294
It's been a while since I've
been back in the States.

14:47.227 --> 14:49.557
- You know that.
- You're missed.

14:51.796 --> 14:52.900
She's alright.

14:59.497 --> 15:01.232
So what's going on?

15:01.850 --> 15:04.073
I know you're not training
these boys for nothing.

15:07.102 --> 15:10.190
Have I arrived just in time
for a new adventure?

15:10.691 --> 15:13.859
Letty you always get here just
in time for something.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.305
Come on, what is it?

15:27.939 --> 15:30.660
I'll block you. You can't see.
What are you gonna do?

15:30.779 --> 15:32.861
Oh my God, we're gonna crash.
Oh no!

15:32.904 --> 15:34.356
What's gonna happen?

16:13.061 --> 16:14.497
Wait, this crazy.

16:17.926 --> 16:22.408
Rain one minute. Clouds the other.
Sunlight next.

16:29.957 --> 16:31.167
Where you taking me?

16:32.256 --> 16:35.394
Wait 'til you see.
Wait 'til you see.

16:40.487 --> 16:41.836
Come here.

17:42.493 --> 17:46.710
You feel that?
How could you be 3,000 miles away from that?

17:46.764 --> 17:47.738
Can't.
