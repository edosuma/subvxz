00:04.680 --> 00:07.514
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This is the story of two sisters:</i>

00:07.760 --> 00:11.470
<i>Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:15.953
<i>Jessica lives in a neighbourhood</i>
<i>known as rich.</i>

00:16.160 --> 00:17.753
<i>Jessica likes life.</i>

00:17.960 --> 00:20.953
<i>The only thing about life</i>
<i>she would change, if she could,</i>

00:21.160 --> 00:23.595
<i>is that she would set it</i>
<i>all to music.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:28.676
<i>The Tates have more secrets</i>
<i>than they do money.</i>

00:31.320 --> 00:34.518
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>Mary Campbell's house.</i>

00:36.280 --> 00:37.839
<i>Mary, too, likes life.</i>

00:38.040 --> 00:41.875
<i>Unfortunately, life doesn't seem</i>
<i>to be too crazy about her.</i>

00:42.080 --> 00:46.791
<i>As you can see, the Campbells</i>
<i>don't have nearly as much money</i>
<i>as the Tates.</i>

00:47.560 --> 00:51.270
<i>They do, however,</i>
<i>have as many secrets.</i>

00:55.080 --> 00:57.117
<i>In last week's episode of</i> Soap

00:57.360 --> 00:59.317
<i>Mary realises that Jessica</i>
<i>and Corinne</i>

00:59.520 --> 01:02.831
<i>are playing something other</i>
<i>than tennis with Peter, the tennis pro.</i>

01:03.080 --> 01:04.833
<i>Neither Jessica nor Corinne</i>
<i>realise</i>

01:05.080 --> 01:07.959
<i>that they both are engaged</i>
<i>in a game of mixed doubles.</i>

01:08.160 --> 01:10.391
<i>Jessica is so overwhelmed</i>
<i>with guilt</i>

01:10.600 --> 01:13.195
<i>she attempts to confess</i>
<i>her affair to Chester.</i>

01:13.400 --> 01:14.834
<i>But Chester isn't listening,</i>

01:15.040 --> 01:19.239
<i>because he's so overwhelmed by his</i>
<i>secretary Claire's blackmail attempts.</i>

01:19.480 --> 01:22.314
<i>Meanwhile at the Campbells,</i>
<i>Mary has threatened to move out</i>

01:22.520 --> 01:24.671
<i>unless Burt and Danny</i>
<i>try to get along.</i>

01:24.920 --> 01:26.798
<i>Getting along with</i>
<i>his stepfather, Burt,</i>

01:27.000 --> 01:28.912
<i>becomes even more difficult</i>
<i>for Danny</i>

01:29.120 --> 01:32.591
<i>once the Godfather tells him Burt</i>
<i>was the man who killed his father.</i>

01:32.840 --> 01:35.958
<i>Since the Mob will kill Danny</i>
<i>if he doesn't kill Burt,</i>

01:36.200 --> 01:39.591
<i>Danny realises trying to please</i>
<i>his mother will be a problem.</i>

01:39.800 --> 01:41.598
<i>But Mary's problems</i>
<i>don't end there,</i>

01:41.800 --> 01:44.679
<i>since her other son, Jodie,</i>
<i>is about to become her daughter.</i>

01:44.880 --> 01:45.880
<i>Confused?</i>

01:46.040 --> 01:50.159
<i>You won't be after</i>
<i>this week's episode of</i> Soap.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.635
Good grief.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.317
Are you just coming home?

02:03.560 --> 02:05.791
Shh. Are they still sleeping?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
My goodness.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.880
You stay out all night,
you sleep all day.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.879
The only time I get a chance
to clean your room is midnight.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.796
Come on, Benson.
I got enough problems.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.321
It's unhealthy,
that's what it is.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.592
You never see the sun,
you don't eat regular meals.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.395
You hardly ever even stand up.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.034
You better get a job, girl.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.160
[GASPS]

02:31.320 --> 02:32.993
Oh!
Morning, Ma.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.953
My goodness,
you're up bright and early.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.753
Oh, well...

02:36.960 --> 02:38.792
Well, I was just leaving.
I'm, uh...

02:39.000 --> 02:40.559
I'm going out to look for a job.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.917
As a night watchman.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.518
Well, I'll see you later, Ma.

02:45.720 --> 02:49.555
Yes, good luck with the job.
Oh, thanks.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.600
Benson.
Huh?

02:52.800 --> 02:54.553
Why isn't the table set
for breakfast?

02:54.760 --> 02:56.638
Because I didn't set it.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.718
Oh, well, I suppose
that's a good reason.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.480
And I ain't gonna set it.
Oh, Benson, you have to set the table.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.636
I mean, we have to eat.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.752
People in this house
don't eat breakfast.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.270
They run in, bend over,
sip and leave.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.871
So that's it for table setting.
Table setting is out.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.315
Jessica?
JESSICA: Yes, dear.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.477
Where's breakfast?
The dining room is empty.

03:14.680 --> 03:15.680
I know, dear.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.436
We're having a kind of a buffet
in the kitchen this morning.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.678
Chester, how would you like for me
to make you some waffles?

03:22.920 --> 03:26.197
Just toast and coffee.
Ah.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.517
Benson?
Hm?

03:30.720 --> 03:33.918
Why is it everyone else's toast
is always a nice, normal colour,

03:34.120 --> 03:35.918
and mine is always black?

03:41.560 --> 03:44.837
Black ain't a nice,
normal colour?

03:45.360 --> 03:47.511
I'm talking about toast, Benson.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.392
Now, why is mine black?

03:53.240 --> 03:55.357
Because it's burnt.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.834
Why don't we fire him?

03:59.040 --> 04:02.078
Oh, don't be silly, darling.
We can't fire Benson.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.959
What do you mean, we can't?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.317
Nobody but Benson
would put up with us.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.237
What are you talking about,
Jessica? We're a perfectly
nice, normal family.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.071
Good morning, Daddy.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.632
MAJOR:
Where have I landed?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.349
In the kitchen, you idiot.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.430
Oh, colonel!

04:21.640 --> 04:25.111
I was afraid the wind had
blown me behind enemy lines.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.913
Here, Daddy.
Hi, Gramps.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.600
There's nobody
in the dining room.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.395
I know, dear.
We're all in here.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.434
Could Mommy fix you a nice
bowl of cereal for breakfast?

04:34.640 --> 04:36.199
No, thanks, Ma.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.120
You got home
very late last night.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.999
Yeah, I know. I had a date.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.436
Uh, you know, Billy,
I think maybe it's time

04:43.640 --> 04:46.439
that you and I had
a little man-to-man talk.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.275
Ah, that's all right, Dad.
Benson took care of that already.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.077
Benson took care of what?

04:55.320 --> 04:58.040
Sex. See, we also
learned it in school.

04:58.240 --> 05:01.870
Of course, in school,
they teach us about chickens
and fruit flies mating, you know.

05:02.640 --> 05:07.510
Chester, what would
a chicken see in a fruit fly?

05:14.960 --> 05:17.680
I don't know, Jessica.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.160
I don't know why they
have to teach us about animals.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.039
Benson told it better.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.910
Well, I'm sure that Benson,
in his primitive way,

05:27.120 --> 05:29.077
explained things to you.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.638
But I think it's a good idea if you
had the right view of things.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.150
The white view?

05:37.120 --> 05:41.319
Chester, do whites
and blacks do it differently?

05:43.200 --> 05:46.272
I said, "the right view,"
Jessica.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.999
Well, I know how it works, Dad.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.194
Unfortunately, it hasn't
changed my life any.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.276
He just drank raw eggs.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.836
You just ate burnt toast.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.154
Morning, everyone. Daddy.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.192
Morning, princess.
Good morning, darling.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.757
Eunice, how would you like
some pancakes for breakfast?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.560
Oh, no, thank you, Mother.
I'm on 300 calories a day.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.679
Three hundred calories?
But, darling, what can you eat?

06:32.920 --> 06:37.119
Nothing. If I brush my teeth twice
a day, that puts me a little over.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.635
[LAUGHS]

06:41.520 --> 06:43.989
How would you like a ride
to the station, puss?

06:44.200 --> 06:47.352
Oh, no, thanks, Daddy.
I'm flying to Washington
to cover a press conference.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.120
Ah. Careful of those
congressmen.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.999
Too late.

06:54.600 --> 07:01.279
Jessica, would you tell Benson
to starch my shirts, not my shorts?

07:01.480 --> 07:05.599
I feel like I'm walking around
with saltines in my pants.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.516
I better get going, Mother.
I'll be home tonight.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.439
All right, darling.
Have a safe trip.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.632
Bye-bye, Major.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.749
One thing I like about
you Italian women.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.156
You're very grateful.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.716
Maybe this evening,

07:19.920 --> 07:23.914
I'll bring you some nylon
stockings and Hershey bars.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.434
Mother, this war thing
is getting worse and worse.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.030
He doesn't even know
where he is anymore.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.390
His mind...

07:31.600 --> 07:36.800
Mind! Young lady,
I'll have you know my mind
is sharp as candy, thank God.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.593
Come in.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.150
[♪♪♪]

07:49.640 --> 07:52.792
Listen, babe, I hate
to rush you, but I got
another lesson real soon.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.755
The real reason I came here
today was to break up with you.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.040
[CHUCKLES]

07:58.200 --> 07:59.429
Break up with me?
Yeah.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.433
I mean, ironic, isn't it?
Yeah.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.872
See, I mean,
I let this happen once before,

08:05.080 --> 08:08.391
but I came here today to tell you
I could never let it happen again.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.195
And then I mean, I no sooner
than get here than I let happen

08:11.400 --> 08:13.835
exactly what I said
I would never let happen again.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.753
Yeah, what happens
happens, you know.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.270
Yes, but I mean,
why did it happen?

08:18.800 --> 08:21.315
Do you think maybe
I'm in love with you?

08:22.520 --> 08:24.159
You're not, no.
Well, maybe.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.354
I mean, my stomach goes
flip-flop and I'm all shivery.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.838
Oh, that's the flu, the intestinal flu.
I had it myself, last week.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.191
I think you should go
right home and get to bed.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.274
Oh, I hope my mother
isn't looking down
from heaven at this.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.789
I mean, this would kill her.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.231
This is not love.
This is the flu.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.353
Then, of course, if my mother
is looking down from heaven,

08:45.560 --> 08:50.032
being very nearsighted,
maybe she wouldn't know
it was me anyway.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.120
Then again, maybe in heaven,
people aren't nearsighted.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.199
I mean, if there is
a life after death,

08:57.400 --> 08:59.517
I wonder if you need
glasses for it.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.356
Mother!

09:02.400 --> 09:03.516
Corinne!

09:04.800 --> 09:06.712
Corinne, hello, I...

09:06.920 --> 09:09.310
I was just at the end
of my tennis lesson.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.637
See, I, uh...
I take my lessons up here,

09:11.840 --> 09:14.958
because the lines on the court
make me so nervous.

09:15.160 --> 09:16.913
That's right, the lines.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.995
Peter thought of this.
This sort of takes the
pressure off. You know?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.920
Keep your knees
bent now and follow
through with the racket.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.634
Yeah.
Over the shoulder.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.553
PETER: I think you're getting it.
JESSICA: I got it.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.479
There, you got it. Good!
I got it.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.674
I got it.
I think you've got it.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.633
Yeah, and thank you.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.832
I got it. Bye.
PETER: See you next week. Bye.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.954
She's really improving.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.436
Really...

09:43.600 --> 09:45.159
improving.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.153
[♪♪♪]

09:47.640 --> 09:50.235
And you don't have to be
a baseball player to use Ball 4.

09:50.440 --> 09:54.195
After the game, I always use it
for the game that's coming up.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.352
And cut. Good.
I think we got it.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.029
Thank you.
That's a wrap, everybody.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.357
All right. Thank you.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.156
Thank you very much.
Well, how'd it look?

10:04.400 --> 10:05.400
Terrific.
Good.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.791
Listen, if you need tickets to a game
sometime, just let me know.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.480
I'll take you up on that.
Hey, how about this Sunday,
49er game?

10:10.600 --> 10:11.829
Done.
Out of sight. Great.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.396
That's gonna be a great game.
They got a great defence,
toughest in the league.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.001
All right, Dennis,
what's going on?

10:16.200 --> 10:18.920
You broke two dates
with me in the last week.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.078
I told you, I had a terrible week.
I mean, I had a rough game Sunday.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.835
It's not just that, Dennis.
It's a lot of little things.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.713
I mean, you're different.
Well, how?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.196
How? Like Friday night
when we went out for dinner.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.272
You asked for a table
instead of a booth.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.631
You spent the whole meal
talking to those people next to us.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.560
And then you tell me,
"I have a headache."

10:39.480 --> 10:42.678
I did. I got kicked
in the head in practise.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.115
Is there another guy?

10:44.360 --> 10:45.510
Oh, come on, Jodie.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.479
It's Ralph, isn't it?
It's not Ralph.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.399
Fine, hey, you wanna be
with Ralph, be with Ralph.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.512
I mean, the man has
the IQ of an avocado

10:51.720 --> 10:54.235
and the worst nose job
that I've ever seen.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.557
It's not Ralph.
It's David, then, hm?

10:56.760 --> 10:58.638
It's not David.
Because he lied, Dennis.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.912
He was never Barbra
Streisand's hairdresser.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.160
It's not David.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.874
It's Bob. It's Bob.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.200
Jodie, it's not another guy.
Then what the heck is it?

11:07.760 --> 11:09.160
Well, it's...

11:09.360 --> 11:10.396
It's a woman.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.200

21:52.800 --> 21:55.520
Danny, Danny, you did it.
You quit the Mob.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.996
And you're giving me your gun.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.791
Oh, I'm so proud of you,
Danny. So proud.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.559
I can't believe this.
I can't believe what's
going on here.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.195
Not without the mayonnaise.
It's in the icebox.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.073
Oh, I'm feeling so good.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.680
I swear, I'm feeling so good.

22:11.880 --> 22:15.157
If I could carry a tune,
I'd sing a song.
Thank you very much.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.670
What a wonderful day
this has turned out to be.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.435
And I can't tell you
how happy I am about
you and me, Danny.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.553
If you think I'm happy,
you should see how happy
your mother is.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.720
Of course, she wouldn't
be happy if she saw the
sandwich I was... Thank you.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.560
You know, I think
it's all gonna work out.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.754
I mean, so much
has happened today,
so many wonderful things.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.873
You know, I think today is
the happiest day of my life.

22:35.080 --> 22:39.836
I know I already said that,
but it's just because I'm so happy.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.992
And this, this looks terrific.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.954
A terrific sandwich
for a terrific day.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.321
Ah, it's almost ready.
And now, Danny, we're gonna
have ourselves a treat, Danny.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.278
Hi, Burt. Hi, Danny.
Hi.

22:51.960 --> 22:52.960
Hi.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.918
So see you later, Danny.
You bet.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.560
I can't believe it.

23:01.760 --> 23:05.834
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,
the difference in your relationship.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.760
Oh, it's just night and day, Mary.
Just night and day.
