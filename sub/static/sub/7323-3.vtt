THAT'S KINDA WEIRD.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.362
OH, HE'S ASLEEP. GET IN.

00:31.362 --> 00:34.165
(Meredith) MOST SURGEONS
GREW UP BEING FREAKS.

00:34.165 --> 00:39.070
WHILE OTHER KIDS
PLAYED OUTSIDE...

00:39.070 --> 00:41.072

HAVE BEEN CLEARED TO OPERATE.

01:03.534 --> 01:05.536
THE REMAINING CASES WILL BE
REFERRED TO DR. WYATT,

01:05.536 --> 01:08.139
AND SHE'LL CLEAR THOSE PEOPLE
WHEN SHE FEELS THEY'RE READY.

01:08.139 --> 01:10.141
WHAT ABOUT CRISTINA YANG?
WHAT'S THE TIMELINE THERE?

01:10.141 --> 01:12.443
DR. PERKINS FELT THAT
WE SHOULD ASSIGN DR. YANG

01:12.443 --> 01:15.146
TO SOMETHING LOW-STRESS
FOR A FEW MONTHS--

01:15.146 --> 01:16.447
RESEARCH, ADMIN DUTIES.

01:16.447 --> 01:19.180
ADMINISTRATION?
THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.284
PUT HER ON MY SERVICE.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.186
SHE'S NOT ON ANYONE'S SERVICE,
DEREK.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.358
SHE'LL BE IN THE HOSPITAL, SHE
JUST WON'T GO NEAR A SURGERY.

01:27.358 --> 01:29.360
WELL, YOU DO THAT,
AND SHE'LL LEAVE.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.362
SHE WILL NOT COME BACK
TO THIS PROGRAM.

01:31.362 --> 01:33.464
PUT HER ON MY SERVICE.
I ALREADY TRIED IT,
SHEPHERD.

01:33.464 --> 01:36.197
HUNT'S RIGHT.
SHE'S NOT READY.
WELL, SHE WASN'T READY BEFORE.
MAYBE NOW SHE IS.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.729
I THINK WE SHOULD
GIVE HIM A SHOT.
WELL, ESPECIALLY IF
NOTHING ELSE IS WORKING.

01:38.729 --> 01:40.871
SHE CRAWLED UNDER A TABLE
IN THE O.R. TWO WEEKS AGO.

01:40.871 --> 01:43.404
THANK YOU.
(doctors all talking at once)

01:43.404 --> 01:45.206
SHE GOES, I GO.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.208
(talking stops)

01:47.208 --> 01:48.709
THAT'S INSANE.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.442
(doctors all talking at once)
IF SHE GOES, I GO.

01:51.442 --> 01:54.215
(Meredith) I THINK
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.717
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. I MEAN,
THEY--THEY--THEY CAN'T

01:56.717 --> 02:00.391
KICK YOU OUT OF THE PROGRAM
FOR BEING TRAUMATIZED.

02:00.391 --> 02:02.453
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY DO.

02:02.453 --> 02:04.755
(doctors speaking indistinctly)

02:04.755 --> 02:06.757
DR. YANG, YOU'RE WITH ME.

02:06.757 --> 02:08.259
WHAT? N-NO.

02:08.259 --> 02:09.760
I'M WITH YOU.

02:09.760 --> 02:12.263
YOU'RE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.
WE'RE WALKING, DR. YANG.
UH--

02:12.263 --> 02:13.764
(Meredith) DEREK.

02:15.306 --> 02:16.437
HEY.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.609
WHERE COULD I FIND
DR. SHEPHERD?

02:18.609 --> 02:21.512
YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?
I DON'T.

02:21.512 --> 02:24.144
UH, COULD YOU JUST POINT ME
IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS OFFICE?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.547
I'M SORRY.

02:26.547 --> 02:29.220
SHE HAS THAT LOOK ON HER FACE
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME SOMEONE

02:29.220 --> 02:31.522
WALKED INTO THIS HOSPITAL
LOOKING FOR DR. SHEPHERD

02:31.522 --> 02:34.455
WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT,
HE SHOT HIM.
MARK! OH.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.557
(laughs)
OH, MY GOD!

02:36.557 --> 02:39.190
HI, AMY.
YOU STILL LOOK HOT.

02:39.190 --> 02:41.692
AND YOU, UH, LOOK
A LOT MORE GROWN-UP

02:41.692 --> 02:43.694
THAN WHEN I LAST SAW YOU.

02:43.694 --> 02:46.497
YOU CAN SAY "HOT," YOU KNOW?
'CAUSE I AM. I'M HOT.
NO, I CAN'T,

02:46.497 --> 02:49.340
BECAUSE IN MY MIND, YOU'RE STILL
DEREK'S 12-YEAR-OLD SISTER.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.302
HUH.
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN SEATTLE?

02:51.302 --> 02:54.375
UH, DEREK'S AN ASS
WHO WON'T RETURN MY CALLS.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.378
DEREK'S AN ASS WHO GOT SHOT
AND WON'T RETURN MY CALLS,

02:57.378 --> 03:01.212
SO I BROUGHT HIM A PRESENT
OR A BRIBE OR A PEACE OFFERING.

03:01.212 --> 03:03.914
WHATEVER. I BROUGHT HIM THAT.
IMAGINE HOW SURPRISED
AND RELIEVED WE WERE

03:03.914 --> 03:07.187
WHEN WE GREW UP AND FOUND OUT
THERE WERE OTHERS OUT THERE

03:07.187 --> 03:09.890
JUST AS FREAKY AS WE WERE...
YOU BROUGHT HIM BRETT FAVRE?

03:09.890 --> 03:11.392
(elevator bell dings)

03:11.392 --> 03:13.524
NO. I BROUGHT HIM
A BRAIN TUMOR.

03:13.524 --> 03:16.297
SAME MICROSCOPES,
SAME DEAD FROGS,

03:16.297 --> 03:21.732
SAME INEXPLICABLE URGE
TO TAKE HUMAN BEINGS APART.

03:21.732 --> 03:23.874
TALK TO CRISTINA.
SHE'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

03:23.874 --> 03:25.876
I CAN'T PUSH HER.
IN TWO WEEKS, MY LANDLORD

03:25.876 --> 03:28.809
IS GONNA HAND KEYS TO A SWEDISH
COUPLE WITH A TRUCKLOAD

03:28.809 --> 03:31.442
OF SWEDISH FURNITURE,
AND I SAID I'D BE GONE.
TEDDY, CAN YOU...

03:31.442 --> 03:33.544
(clears throat) MENTION IT
TO OWEN, LIKE CASUALLY,

03:33.544 --> 03:35.286
"HEY, HOW'S
THE APARTMENT SEARCH GOING?

03:35.286 --> 03:37.448
NO PRESSURE, BUT CALLIE
AND ARIZONA HAVE A LIFE."

03:37.448 --> 03:40.821
(exhales)
"YOU'RE CROWDING THEM,
AND ARIZONA CAN'T HANDLE IT."

03:40.821 --> 03:43.254
(elevator bell dings)

03:43.254 --> 03:44.995
OH, MY GOD. ARE--

03:44.995 --> 03:47.227
TEDDY, ARE YOU OKAY?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.929
(voice breaking) UM...

03:48.929 --> 03:51.262
ANDREW'S LEAVING.

03:51.262 --> 03:54.465
OH. OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.
SHE GOT ATTACHED.

03:54.465 --> 03:56.937
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

03:56.937 --> 03:59.410
SMART AND COOL
AND G.I. JANE.

03:59.410 --> 04:02.012
I KNOW THAT. I KNOW THAT.
INSTEAD, I GOT ATTACHED

04:02.012 --> 04:05.446
TO THE TRAUMA GUY WHO SWOOPS IN
AND SWOOPS OUT A MONTH LATER.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.778
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
I'M NOT G.I. JANE.

04:07.778 --> 04:09.450
I'M ATTACHMENT BARBIE.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.552
OH, YOU POOR THING.
COME HERE.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.883
(sniffles)

04:12.883 --> 04:15.586
COME HERE, COME HERE,
COME HERE.

04:16.987 --> 04:18.289
(sighs)

04:18.289 --> 04:20.291
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

04:20.291 --> 04:21.832
WHAT?

04:21.832 --> 04:23.834
TELLING OWEN
TO GET OFF HIS ASS

04:23.834 --> 04:27.868
AND GET HIS TRAUMATIZED WIFE
OUT OF OUR APARTMENT.
(laughs)

04:27.868 --> 04:30.701
MEREDITH IS
A MUCH BETTER DOCTOR THAN ME.

04:30.701 --> 04:32.703
NO, SHE'S NOT.
I AM, TOO.
SORRY, CRISTINA.

04:32.703 --> 04:34.705
OH, NO. NO OFFENSE TAKEN.
SHE--SHE IS.
(pager beeping)

04:34.705 --> 04:37.578
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.
OKAY,
HOW ABOUT WE COMPROMISE?

04:37.578 --> 04:40.551
WHY DON'T YOU PAGE ME
WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING?
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

04:40.551 --> 04:42.052
(Derek) OH, COME ON.

04:42.052 --> 04:44.755
AMY?
WELL, IF YOU'D PICK UP
THE DAMN PHONE,

04:44.755 --> 04:47.558
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO STALK YOU.
YEAH. WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL YOUR SISTER?

04:47.558 --> 04:50.290
SISTER?
MEREDITH, CRISTINA,

04:50.290 --> 04:51.862
THIS IS AMY.
AMELIA.

04:51.862 --> 04:54.525
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO GETS TO CALL ME AMY.

04:54.525 --> 04:56.697
UM, NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.
LIKEWISE.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.970
AMY--AMELIA--
IS ALSO A NEUROSURGEON.

04:59.970 --> 05:02.433
ANOTHER ONE? YOU SHEPHERDS
GROW THEM LIKE WEEDS.
WHO'S THIS, YOUR HUSBAND?

05:02.433 --> 05:04.775
DEREK, THIS IS TOM.
TODD.

05:04.775 --> 05:07.778
(elevator bell dings)
OH, BEST OF LUCK
TO YOU BOTH. (scoffs)

05:07.778 --> 05:11.812
NO, WE MET ON THE PLANE. HE HAS
A PROBABLE PITUITARY TUMOR.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.814
DID SHE SAY YOU HAD
SPONGY HANDS?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.446
YEAH. (laughs)

05:15.446 --> 05:17.448
(laughs) YEAH. WERE YOUR HANDS
ON HER BREASTS AT THE TIME?
YEAH.

05:17.448 --> 05:19.019
SO THIS WAS
A MILE-HIGH HOOKUP?

05:19.019 --> 05:22.322
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT HE'S A VERY SICK MAN.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.426
IF HE HAS SYMPTOMS,
IT COULD BE A TUMOR.
NOT JUST "COULD."
IT--IT IS.

05:25.426 --> 05:29.400
ALL RIGHT. WELL, THIS FINE LADY
WILL FIND YOU A SURGEON.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.402
DEREK, SHE'S YOUR SISTER.

05:31.402 --> 05:34.405
YOU CAN BUY HER
A CUP OF COFFEE.
I HAVE A LOT OF SISTERS,

05:34.405 --> 05:36.407
AND IF I BOUGHT THEM ALL COFFEE,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING.

05:36.407 --> 05:38.609
DEREK--
ALL RIGHT, TODD NEEDS A WORKUP.
WILL YOU TAKE CARE OF IT?

05:38.609 --> 05:41.071
I CAN DO IT.
YANG'S ON MY SERVICE.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO

05:41.071 --> 05:44.014
HAVE A GOOD DAY WITH AMY, OKAY?
SHE'S A LAUGH A MINUTE.

05:44.014 --> 05:46.016
CAN YOU HOLD
THE DOOR OPEN, PLEASE?

05:46.016 --> 05:47.518
THANK YOU.

05:47.518 --> 05:49.450
EASY.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.423
OKAY.

05:52.423 --> 05:54.425
KAREV, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR? GET ON.

05:54.425 --> 05:55.886
(whispers indistinctly)

05:55.886 --> 05:58.429
I-I JUST REMEMBERED. DR. HUNT
NEEDS HIS LAB RESULTS.

05:58.429 --> 06:00.991
I'LL--I'LL MEET YOU UP THERE.
THIS PATIENT
TAKES PRIORI--KAREV, WHAT--

06:00.991 --> 06:02.493
I CAN DO IT.

06:02.493 --> 06:05.496
NO, UH, DR. KEPNER HAS A COUPLE
OF PATIENTS IN THE E.R.

06:05.496 --> 06:06.937
GO HELP HER.

06:06.937 --> 06:09.940
IS DR. WEBBER GOING UP?
I-I NEED AN EXTRA HAND.
HE SENT ME.

06:09.940 --> 06:13.073
OH, UH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON
DR. SHEPHERD'S SERVICE TODAY.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.075
HE TOOK CRISTINA.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.408
WHY? (chuckles)
I MEAN, WHY?

06:17.408 --> 06:19.650
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S OKAY,
DO YOU? 'CAUSE I DON'T.

06:19.650 --> 06:22.012
I MEAN, SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE
THIS MORNING.

06:22.012 --> 06:24.014
DID SHE SPEND THE NIGHT?
BECAUSE SHE'S MARRIED.

06:24.014 --> 06:26.016
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD
FOR SOMEONE TO--

06:26.016 --> 06:28.018
APRIL,
DON'T TALK ABOUT CRISTINA.

06:28.018 --> 06:30.020
JUST MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.723
I'M SORRY. UM, I WAS JUST--
I WAS JUST CONCERNED,

06:32.723 --> 06:35.566
BUT I WILL TRY NOT TO BE.

06:35.566 --> 06:38.569
(car alarm chirps,
door lock clicks)
I SWEAR TO GOD, JERRY,
IF YOU DON'T GET OUT OF THE CAR,

06:38.569 --> 06:40.070
I'M GONNA BREAK THE GLASS

06:40.070 --> 06:42.072
AND DRAG YOU THROUGH
THE FREAKIN' WINDOW!
NO!

06:42.072 --> 06:44.034
UM, LOOK, MA'AM,
THIS IS AN AMBULANCE BAY.

06:44.034 --> 06:46.937
IT'S FOR DOCTOR
AND PATIENT VEHICLES ONLY.

06:46.937 --> 06:49.940
WELL, IF MY IDIOT HUSBAND
WOULD EVER GET OUT OF THE CAR,

06:49.940 --> 06:52.543
YOU'D SEE HE WAS A PATIENT.
(car alarm chirps,
door lock clicks)

06:52.543 --> 06:54.985
JERRY, UNLOCK THE DOOR.
JUST TAKE ME HOME, TESS!

06:54.985 --> 06:56.917
THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE.
UM, SIR.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.119
IF THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU,

06:59.119 --> 07:01.492
YOU SHOULD LET US
TAKE A LOOK.

07:01.492 --> 07:03.053
WE CAN HELP.

07:03.053 --> 07:05.726
REALLY?
CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THESE?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.633
UH, YES.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.505
YES, WE CAN.

07:14.505 --> 07:18.138
BUT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL
YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.044
YOU'LL HAVE TO
OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.746
OKAY. UM...
(chirps)

07:25.746 --> 07:28.048
I NEED A-A CHAIR.
OH, OKAY.

07:31.682 --> 07:33.123
OH, MY--

07:33.123 --> 07:35.586
I'M SORRY.

07:35.586 --> 07:37.728
PEOPLE ARE GREAT,
AREN'T THEY?

07:39.089 --> 07:41.492
REAL SWEETHEARTS.

07:43.494 --> 07:44.495
(groans)

07:44.495 --> 07:46.737
(Miranda whispers) OKAY.

07:54.605 --> 07:56.006
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

07:56.006 --> 07:57.708
YOU WILL APOLOGIZE TO HIM.

07:57.708 --> 08:00.711
PROFUSELY.
AND YOU WILL STAY
BY HIS SIDE ALL DAY...

08:00.711 --> 08:03.113
YES.
EVEN DURING LUNCH.

08:03.113 --> 08:05.516
I DON'T THINK
I'LL BE WANTING LUNCH.

08:05.516 --> 08:07.858
YES, YES, I WILL.

08:07.858 --> 08:10.160
FINE. GO GET DR. SLOAN.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.926
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

08:15.926 --> 08:18.228
I WASN'T TRYING
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

08:18.228 --> 08:21.101
THERE'S A FEW THINGS
I DON'T TALK ABOUT,

08:21.101 --> 08:23.704
AND CRISTINA'S ONE OF THEM.
UM, SO IS THERE
ANY CHEST PAIN

08:23.704 --> 08:25.205
OR IS IT JUST
DIFFICULTY BREATHING?

08:25.205 --> 08:27.107
UH, IT'S--IT'S KINDA BOTH.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.239
IT'S CANCER.
IT'S NOT CANCER.

08:29.239 --> 08:32.012
OOH, IT'S CANCER
OR IT'S, UM...

08:32.012 --> 08:33.714
ANXIETY ABOUT THE WEDDING.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.515
OH, WHEN ARE YOU
GETTING MARRIED?
TWO WEEKS.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.018
(clears throat and coughs)
WELL, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO GET A CHEST X-RAY,

08:38.018 --> 08:40.050
SO IS THERE ANY CHANCE
THAT YOU COULD BE PREGNANT?

08:40.050 --> 08:41.822
OH...
(clears throat)

08:41.822 --> 08:44.154
MNH-MNH. NOT PREGNANT.
YOU'RE SURE?

08:44.154 --> 08:46.997
SHE'S SURE.
MM-HMM. REALLY SUPER SURE.

08:46.997 --> 08:49.560
(laughs)
(laughs) SHUT UP.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.161
UM, UH,

08:51.161 --> 08:53.704
I AM A VIRGIN.

08:53.704 --> 08:56.536
YEAH. UH, WE'RE WAITING
FOR THE WEDDING.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.939
(laughs)
(laughs)
DANNY'S HAD SEX BEFORE.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.011
IT IS IMPORTANT TO HIM
THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

09:01.011 --> 09:02.843
(laughs)
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

09:02.843 --> 09:06.577
(sighs) OKAY.
THEY THINK WE'RE FREAKS.
NO, WE DON'T.

09:06.577 --> 09:08.819
NO, NOT AT ALL.
NO,
THEY THINK YOU'RE A FREAK,

09:08.819 --> 09:11.251
AND I'M JUST VERY,
VERY UNDERSTANDING.
(laughs)

09:11.251 --> 09:13.123
(exhales)

09:13.123 --> 09:15.626
DR. SLOAN,
DR. BAILEY NEEDS A CONSULT

09:15.626 --> 09:17.127
IN ROOM 11-35.

09:17.127 --> 09:18.989
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

09:18.989 --> 09:23.193
(clicking keyboard keys)

09:24.935 --> 09:26.837
LOOK AWAY.

09:26.837 --> 09:28.068
WHAT?

09:28.068 --> 09:31.041
STOP STARING AT HER.
I CAN'T.

09:32.843 --> 09:36.106
(clears throat)

09:36.106 --> 09:38.849
HER LAST WORDS TO YOU WERE,
"LEAVE ME ALONE,"

09:38.849 --> 09:41.852
LEAVE ME ALONE, LEAVE ME ALONE,"
ONLY LOUDER. LOOK AWAY.

09:41.852 --> 09:43.854
MAYBE SHE JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

09:43.854 --> 09:45.255
(elevator bell dings)

09:45.255 --> 09:47.658
I'LL TRY TO LOOK AWAY.

09:47.658 --> 09:49.159
THANK YOU.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.593
(clicking keyboard keys)

09:53.593 --> 09:55.095
DID IT HURT?

09:55.095 --> 09:58.168
GETTING SHOT?
OH, YOU'RE AMAZING.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.771
WELL, DID YOU FEEL THE BULLET
OR DID YOU JUST FEEL PAIN?

10:00.771 --> 10:03.133
I FEEL PAIN NOW BECAUSE YOU
WON'T STOP TALKING.

10:03.133 --> 10:06.176
AND WE HAVE IMAGES.
(clicks and beeps)

10:06.176 --> 10:09.139
YEAH, THERE IT IS.
DR. YANG,
WHAT'S THE BEST APPROACH

10:09.139 --> 10:11.942
ON A TUMOR LIKE THIS?
I DON'T KNOW.

10:11.942 --> 10:13.313
Y--

10:13.313 --> 10:15.686
IT'S A PITUITARY TUMOR,

10:15.686 --> 10:20.851
SO YOU'RE, UH, ACCESS
WOULD BE COMING IN FROM?

10:20.851 --> 10:24.655
YOU GO IN TRANSNASALLY.
CAN WE BOOK AN O.R.?

10:24.655 --> 10:27.397
WHAT'S THE CHANCE OF ME
FINISHING A THOUGHT TODAY?
NOT GREAT. UM,
THERE'S SOME COMPRESSION,

10:27.397 --> 10:30.701
SO I'D LIKE TO GET IN
SOONER THAN LATER.
DR. YANG, CAN YOU BOOK
AN O.R., PLEASE?

10:30.701 --> 10:33.834
YOU'LL BE SCRUBBING IN.
YOU KNOW, IF SHE WANTS TO DO IT,
YOU KNOW, BE MY GUEST.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.966
DR. YANG, BOOK AN O.R.
FINE.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.111
OKAY, THAT'S MY PATIENT
IN THERE.

10:41.111 --> 10:43.113
YOU'RE GONNA LET
WHAT'S HER FACE

10:43.113 --> 10:45.115
WITH THE LEARNING DISABILITY
SCRUB IN?

10:45.115 --> 10:48.679
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SHOOT THE GUY?
DON'T TALK ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE
IN THIS BUILDING.

10:48.679 --> 10:50.681
DON'T CRITICIZE MY SURGEONS.

10:50.681 --> 10:52.753
LEAVE YOUR PATIENT.
GO HOME.

10:56.186 --> 10:58.428
UM, MR. ADAMS,
SOMETIME IN YOUR HISTORY,

10:58.428 --> 11:00.160
YOU CONTRACTED H.P.V.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.893
THERE ARE VARIOUS TYPES
OF THE VIRUS.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.434
THIS ONE GENERALLY CAUSES
SMALL WARTS.

11:04.434 --> 11:07.698
BUT IN RARE CASES LIKE YOURS,
THERE'S AN IMMUNE DEFICIENCY

11:07.698 --> 11:11.141
THAT ALLOWS THE WARTS
TO GET OUT OF CONTROL.

11:11.141 --> 11:14.044
WE WENT TO A DERMATOLOGIST
IN PULLMAN FOUR YEARS AGO.

11:14.044 --> 11:16.046
THEY WERE A LOT SMALLER THEN.

11:16.046 --> 11:18.678
HE REMOVED A BUNCH OF THEM,
BUT--
THEY GREW BACK.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.111
THEN WE SAW THE GUY AGAIN,
AND THEY GREW BACK AGAIN.

11:21.111 --> 11:23.353
THEY'RE ALWAYS
GONNA GROW BACK.

11:23.353 --> 11:26.216
AND THAT'S WHY
WE SHOULD JUST GO HOME.
WELL, IF YOU DON'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

11:26.216 --> 11:28.218
THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE
TO GROW.

11:28.218 --> 11:30.420
YOU'LL BECOME
COMPLETELY DISABLED.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.763
WE NEED TO DO SURGERY.

11:32.763 --> 11:34.394
YOU CAN'T JUST
SCRAPE THE STUFF OFF?

11:34.394 --> 11:38.228
NO. UM, EACH ONE OF THE WARTS
HAS ITS OWN BLOOD SUPPLY.

11:38.228 --> 11:40.230
SO WE NEED TO CUT
AND STITCH EACH ONE.

11:40.230 --> 11:43.874
(Jerry) SO BASICALLY, I'M GONNA
GO FROM LOOKING LIKE A TREE

11:43.874 --> 11:46.406
TO LOOKING LIKE FRANKENSTEIN,
RIGHT?

11:46.406 --> 11:48.078
SUPER.

11:48.078 --> 11:51.111
(Mark) WELL, WE'LL BE DOING
SKIN GRAFTS AT THE SAME TIME,

11:51.111 --> 11:54.284
WHICH WILL HELP WITH
YOUR APPEARANCE AND FUNCTION.

11:54.284 --> 11:57.247
THAT SAID, YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'S NOT A CURE.

11:57.247 --> 12:00.150
THE WARTS WILL RECUR, BUT IF YOU
SCHEDULE SURGERIES REGULARLY,

12:00.150 --> 12:02.252
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO KEEP THEM UNDER CONTROL.

12:02.252 --> 12:04.224
DO YOU SEE?
IT'S WHAT I TOLD YOU.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.926
THEY CAN'T HELP.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.129
SO A COUPLE OF YEARS WITH ME
IS, WHAT...

12:09.129 --> 12:11.031
A WASTE OF TIME?

12:11.031 --> 12:12.432
WE NEVER GO OUT, JERRY.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.806
WE SIT IN THAT DAMN HOUSE, DAY
AFTER DAY, MONTH AFTER MONTH.

12:15.806 --> 12:18.208
I WANT US TO SEE A MOVIE,

12:18.208 --> 12:20.210
TO GO OUT TO DINNER,

12:20.210 --> 12:22.773
I WANT TO SEE... PEOPLE.

12:22.773 --> 12:25.115
UM, IF THE TWO OF YOU
WANT TO DISCUSS IT, WE CAN--

12:25.115 --> 12:27.147
NO.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.419
THERE'S NO MORE DISCUSSION.

12:29.419 --> 12:32.983
YOU'RE HAVING THE SURGERY,

12:32.983 --> 12:34.785
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

12:34.785 --> 12:37.127
I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU.

12:39.129 --> 12:41.361
AND YOU GOT NOBODY ELSE--
NO FRIENDS,

12:41.361 --> 12:43.894
EVEN YOUR BROTHERS
HAVE GIVEN UP.

12:43.894 --> 12:46.236
I'M IT.
I'M ALL THAT'S LEFT.

12:46.236 --> 12:49.269
SO YOU'RE HAVING THE SURGERY.

12:51.501 --> 12:53.173
HEY.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.075
GOT A BRONCHIAL OBSTRUCTION.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.346
NICE.

12:56.346 --> 12:59.209
YOU THINK IT'S BAD IF I WRITE
MY OWN NAME ON YOUR BOARD?

12:59.209 --> 13:01.081
I MEAN,
I DID BRING IN THE PATIENT,

13:01.081 --> 13:03.353
AND THEY GAVE ME PRIVILEGES.

13:03.353 --> 13:05.916
SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERD.

13:05.916 --> 13:07.157
CLASSIC.

13:07.157 --> 13:09.519
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:09.519 --> 13:11.962
YOU THINK
I'M GONNA LET YOU DO TO HIM

13:11.962 --> 13:15.095
WHAT YOU DID TO MY MUSTANG?
I DON'T THINK SO.
(eraser scrapes board)

13:15.095 --> 13:17.497
(eraser thuds)

13:17.497 --> 13:20.500
SHE'S YOUR SISTER.
I--YOU'RE BEING LIKE THIS...
MM-HMM.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.203
BECAUSE SHE CRASHED YOUR CAR
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO?

13:23.203 --> 13:26.176
I TOTALED MY MOM'S CAR.
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.
RIGHT. WHEN YOU TOTALED
YOUR MOTHER'S CAR,

13:26.176 --> 13:28.178
WERE YOU HIGH ON PAIN PILLS?

13:28.178 --> 13:30.110
NO.
DID YOU STEAL
YOUR MOTHER'S PRESCRIPTION PAD

13:30.110 --> 13:33.113
SO YOU COULD FEED
YOUR ADDICTION?
SHE STOLE
YOUR PRESCRIPTION PAD?

13:33.113 --> 13:36.086
YEAH, AND THEN WHEN
SHE WENT HOME, SHE O.D.'ed.

13:36.086 --> 13:37.948
SHE WAS DEAD FOR THREE MINUTES.
I SAVED HER.

13:37.948 --> 13:40.390
THAT'S WHAT SHE PUT MY MOTHER
THROUGH AFTER LOSING MY FATHER

13:40.390 --> 13:42.392
AND RAISING FIVE KIDS
ON HER OWN,

13:42.392 --> 13:44.995
SO, NO, I DON'T TRUST HER
IN MY O.R., OKAY?

13:46.356 --> 13:48.358
HEY, YOU PAGED ME.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

13:48.358 --> 13:50.330
I HAVE TO GET AWAY
FROM SHEPHERD

13:50.330 --> 13:52.032
FOR, LIKE, TEN MINUTES.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.034
HE'S LIKE THE K.G.B.
HE'S EVERYWHERE.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.505
HE'S TRYING TO HELP.

13:55.505 --> 13:57.837
YEAH? WELL, MAKE HIM STOP.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.883
WOULD YOU LOVE ME
IF I WASN'T A SURGEON?

14:20.190 --> 14:23.293
I WOULD LOVE YOU
IF YOU WERE A PLUMBER.

14:23.293 --> 14:26.236
(inhales and exhales deeply)

14:26.236 --> 14:29.499
BUT WOULD YOU LOVE YOU
IF YOU WEREN'T A SURGEON?

14:32.302 --> 14:34.174
I DON'T KNOW.

14:34.174 --> 14:37.147
M-MAYBE.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.190
I CAN'T SLEEP
WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE.

14:55.926 --> 14:58.898
THEN I'LL BE THERE.

15:14.584 --> 15:15.946
CHIEF.

15:15.946 --> 15:17.587
KAREV.

15:19.349 --> 15:20.690
OH, HEY.

15:20.690 --> 15:23.523
UM, CAN YOU TALK TO CRISTINA
ABOUT GETTING HER OWN PLACE?

15:23.523 --> 15:25.525
ARIZONA'S ABOUT TO MOVE IN,
AND IT'S KINDA CROWDED.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.058
I MEAN, THEY WANT TO MOVE OUT.

15:28.058 --> 15:29.929
IT'S JUST, THEY HAVEN'T
GOTTEN THEIR ACT TOGETHER.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.931
AND, UH, IF I ASK HER ABOUT IT,
I'M A BITCH.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.534
BUT IF YOU ASK HER ABOUT IT,
YOU'RE HER BEST FRIEND,

15:34.534 --> 15:38.208
INQUIRING ABOUT A HEALTHY
NEXT STEP IN HER MARRIED LIFE.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.670
CRISTINA'S CAREER
IS HANGING ON BY A THREAD.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.572
SHE CAN'T LOOK AT AN O.R.

15:42.572 --> 15:44.574
WITHOUT BREAKING INTO
A COLD SWEAT, SHE'S A NEWLYWED,

15:44.574 --> 15:46.546
AND LAST NIGHT,
SHE SLEPT IN MY BED

15:46.546 --> 15:49.319
BECAUSE OWEN WAS IN SURGERY,
AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO BE ALONE.

15:49.319 --> 15:52.322
YOU REALLY WANT
TO PUT HER OUT OF HER HOUSE?

15:52.322 --> 15:54.184
(elevator bell dings)

15:54.184 --> 15:56.686
DID YOU TALK TO HER
ABOUT CRISTINA?

15:56.686 --> 16:00.330
WE'RE MONSTERS.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.262
HMM?

16:02.262 --> 16:05.395
A VIRGIN... AT 27?

16:05.395 --> 16:07.167
YEP.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.469
WELL, MAYBE SHE WAS WAITING FOR
THE RIGHT PERSON TO COME ALONG,

16:09.469 --> 16:12.042
SOMEONE SPECIAL,
SOMEONE WHO REALLY GOT HER.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.703
IT'S SWEET. IT'S...

16:13.703 --> 16:16.206
IT'S IDEALISTIC.
IT'S SMART
IS WHAT IT IS.

16:16.206 --> 16:19.349
IF YOU DON'T SLEEP WITH 'EM,
YOU--YOU DON'T GET ATTACHED.

16:19.349 --> 16:21.251
Y-YOU SLEEP WITH THEM,
AND THEN YOU GET ATTACHED

16:21.251 --> 16:23.213
EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO,
EVEN WHEN YOU SPECIFICALLY PICK

16:23.213 --> 16:24.714
SOMEONE THAT YOU ARE SURE

16:24.714 --> 16:26.716
THAT YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
GET ATTACHED,

16:26.716 --> 16:29.519
AND THEN BOOM--YOU'RE HOOKED.

16:29.519 --> 16:30.590
GRASPERS.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.223
IS THAT THE MASS?

16:33.223 --> 16:35.065
(sighs) YEP.

16:35.065 --> 16:37.297
IS IT A TUMOR?

16:37.297 --> 16:41.431
NO, IT--IT LOOKS LIKE...
A FOREIGN OBJECT.

16:41.431 --> 16:43.503

SHE'S SLEEPING WITH MEREDITH.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.282
I'M ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED.
THAT--I'M SORRY.

17:32.282 --> 17:34.784
DON'T YOU FIND THAT
A LITTLE STRANGE?
MM-HMM.

17:34.784 --> 17:36.526
DID YOU SEE "E.T."?

17:36.526 --> 17:38.788
THE MOVIE? YEAH.
YEARS AGO. WHY?
REMEMBER THE KID--ELLIOT?

17:38.788 --> 17:41.561
MM-HMM.
HE AND E.T. HAD THIS WEIRD
AND DISTURBING BOND.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.563
IF HE GOT SICK,
E.T. GOT SICK.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.565
IF E.T. GOT DRUNK,
ELLIOT WOULD GET DRUNK.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.367
THAT'S KINDA LIKE
CRISTINA AND MEREDITH.

18:48.898 --> 18:52.262
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS. IT
WAS A PRIVATE--PRIVATE MEMORY.

18:52.262 --> 18:53.863
WHAT HAPPENED,
DID THE GUY DIE?

18:53.863 --> 18:56.166
ALEX.
OH, DID IT LAST, LIKE,
THREE SECONDS,

18:56.166 --> 18:58.368
SO YOU DON'T KNOW
IF IT COUNTED?
(scoffs) NO.

18:58.368 --> 19:00.370
MM-HMM.

19:00.370 --> 19:01.871
UH...

19:01.871 --> 19:04.143
IT WAS ON THE BEACH AT SUNSET.
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.445
(laughs)
(Jackson) SUNSET?

19:05.445 --> 19:08.178
(April) YEAH.
REALLY? WEREN'T--WEREN'T THERE
PEOPLE THERE?

19:08.178 --> 19:10.780
OH, ON THE BEACH?
MAN, YOU GET SAND UP IN PLACES

19:10.780 --> 19:12.782
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SAND.
(Alex) MOSQUITOES.

19:12.782 --> 19:15.555
MM-HMM. YEAH.
HA! YOU'RE A VIRGIN.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.887
NO, I'M NOT.
OH, MY GOD. YOU ARE!

19:17.887 --> 19:20.530
(Jackson) SHE IS. (laughs)
OH, MY GOD. DO IT. DO IT.
DO IT TO HER RIGHT NOW.

19:20.530 --> 19:24.294
ALEX, GO DEFLOWER HER.
DO IT. DO IT.
IT WAS--IT WAS ON THE BEACH
AT SUNSET, OKAY?

19:24.294 --> 19:25.595
OKAY, LEAVE HER ALONE.

19:25.595 --> 19:28.268
APRIL, THE BEACH AT SUNSET
IS VERY NICE.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.900
♪♪♪

19:30.900 --> 19:32.402
(man speaks indistinctly)

19:32.402 --> 19:35.645
THERE'S A GALLERY UPSTAIRS.
HAVE A SEAT. YOU CAN WATCH.

19:35.645 --> 19:38.177
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
SMART BOY?

19:38.177 --> 19:41.351
YOU CAN PRETEND LIKE
WE AREN'T RELATED, BUT WE ARE.

19:41.351 --> 19:43.313
AND SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO YOU.

19:43.313 --> 19:47.317
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT
FROM ME, AMY?
OKAY, CAN YOU IMAGINE
FOR A SECOND

19:47.317 --> 19:49.559
THAT THIS IS NOT
ALL ABOUT YOU?

19:49.559 --> 19:51.661
TWO MEN IN MY FAMILY
HAVE BEEN SHOT,

19:51.661 --> 19:53.663
ONE OF THEM DIDN'T SURVIVE IT,
AND EVEN THAT

19:53.663 --> 19:56.366
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT BECAUSE I WAS
5, AND I BARELY REMEMBER IT.

19:56.366 --> 19:59.198
DON'T MAKE THIS ABOUT DAD.
WE CAN'T
MAKE IT ABOUT ANYTHING!

19:59.198 --> 20:01.731
YOU WON'T TALK ABOUT DAD.
YOU WON'T TALK ABOUT THIS.
I'M SORRY
THIS IS HARD FOR YOU.

20:01.731 --> 20:03.703
IT'S BEEN HARD
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.706
NOW I HAVE AN OPERATION
I HAVE TO GO DO. GO HOME.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.878
NO, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
HE'S MY PATIENT.

20:08.878 --> 20:11.641
I'M HELPING YOU.
I DON'T NEED HELP. I HAVE
AN EXCEEDINGLY CAPABLE RESIDENT.

20:11.641 --> 20:13.243
REALLY?

20:13.243 --> 20:16.886
UH, SORRY I'M LATE. THERE'S
A LONG LINE AT THE CAFETERIA.

20:16.886 --> 20:19.489
YOU'RE RIGHT. CRACK TEAM.

20:19.489 --> 20:21.321
FINE. YOU CAN STAY.

20:23.293 --> 20:26.296
(saw buzzing)

20:29.259 --> 20:31.701
(buzzing continues)

20:31.701 --> 20:33.703
DR. BAILEY,
HOW CAN YOU TELL

20:33.703 --> 20:35.705
WHICH IS HORN
AND WHICH IS FINGER?

20:35.705 --> 20:39.839
IF THERE'S NO BLEEDING,
I'M STILL CUTTING OFF THE HORN.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.442
IF THERE'S A LOT OF BLEEDING,

20:42.442 --> 20:45.345
I'M PROBABLY
CUTTING OFF A FINGER.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.378
SOMETIMES THIS JOB
IS VERY SIMPLE, DR. AVERY.

20:48.378 --> 20:49.349
(crackles)

20:49.349 --> 20:51.351
(Lexie) OH.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.853
I CAN DO THAT
IF YOU WANT.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.686
SHE'S FINE.
RIGHT, DR. GREY?

20:56.686 --> 20:59.359
RIGHT.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.492
(clatters)

21:02.492 --> 21:04.694
UGH.

21:04.694 --> 21:07.397
WHAT?

21:07.397 --> 21:08.698
NOTHING.

21:08.698 --> 21:12.902
(buzzing resumes)

21:12.902 --> 21:14.904
DANNY, UH,
COULD YOU WAIT OUTSIDE

21:14.904 --> 21:17.347
JUST FOR
A COUPLE OF MINUTES?

21:17.347 --> 21:19.809
WHY? IS--IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
IS SHE--
OH, NO.

21:19.809 --> 21:22.812
WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO TELL ME,
YOU CAN SAY IT IN FRONT OF HIM.

21:22.812 --> 21:24.354
OKAY. UM...

21:24.354 --> 21:25.885
(inhales deeply)

21:25.885 --> 21:29.018
(exhales)
GRETCHEN, YOU'VE...

21:29.018 --> 21:31.761
UM...

21:33.323 --> 21:36.596
(chuckles) OH, OKAY.
GRETCHEN, WH--

21:36.596 --> 21:40.370
UH, WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED IS,
UM... OH.

21:40.370 --> 21:41.731
THE BLOCKAGE IN YOUR LUNG

21:41.731 --> 21:43.833
WAS A CONDOM.

21:43.833 --> 21:44.904
(elevator bell dings)

21:44.904 --> 21:46.776
APPARENTLY, YOU INHALED IT.

21:46.776 --> 21:48.878
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

21:48.878 --> 21:51.581
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
WE'VE REMOVED IT,

21:51.581 --> 21:54.043
AND YOU SHOULD BE FEELING
MUCH BETTER.

21:54.043 --> 21:55.545
WHAT?
DANNY, DANNY--

21:55.545 --> 21:57.417
WAIT A MINUTE. I'VE--I'VE--
I'VE WAITED TWO YEARS,

21:57.417 --> 22:00.019
AND YOU BEEN HAVING SEX
WITH SOMEONE ELSE?
NO, NO, NO, NO.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.392
PLENTY OF PEOPLE USE CONDOMS
TO PROTECT AGAINST

22:02.392 --> 22:04.394
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
WHEN THEY'RE DOING...

22:04.394 --> 22:06.756
OTHER SORTS OF THINGS.

22:06.756 --> 22:08.398
WE DON'T.

22:08.398 --> 22:11.060
DANNY, PLEASE!
DANNY, DON'T! DANNY.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.346
OKAY, YOU SEE HOW I'M
REMOVING THE TUMOR GENTLY?

22:27.346 --> 22:29.779
NOT REALLY.

22:29.779 --> 22:31.851
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:31.851 --> 22:34.083
OKAY, IRRIGATE AND SUCTION.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.785
(gurgles)

22:35.785 --> 22:38.027
GOOD. GOOD. OKAY.
CAN YOU SEE NOW?

22:38.027 --> 22:40.359
(beeping continues)

22:40.359 --> 22:42.361
YEAH, I CAN.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.634
OKAY. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE
A LITTLE BIT BETTER NOW,

22:44.634 --> 22:47.397
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE DOING--
(monitor beeping erratically)

22:47.397 --> 22:50.440
OH, DAMN IT. OH, NO.
IT'S BLEEDING TOO MUCH.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.443
THE CAROTID?
COULD BE. OKAY.
BACKING OUT NOW.

22:53.443 --> 22:55.475
OKAY, DR. YANG,
I NEED YOU TO DO

22:55.475 --> 22:58.448
SOME NASAL PACKING, PLEASE.
UH, NO.
UM, UM, YOU CAN DO IT.

22:58.448 --> 23:00.650
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PRETTY.
JUST PACK IT IN THERE.
NO, I-I CAN'T.

23:00.650 --> 23:03.112
YES, YOU CAN. JUST DO IT.
NO, STOP, STOP.
PLEASE STOP IT. I JUST...

23:03.112 --> 23:04.914
YOU DO IT.

23:04.914 --> 23:07.557
(beeping continues)

23:07.557 --> 23:10.389
PASS ME GELFOAM
AND THROMBIN.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.761
GIVE ME SUCTION.

23:11.761 --> 23:13.122
(beeping continues)

23:13.122 --> 23:15.565
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO OPEN HIM UP.

23:15.565 --> 23:17.096
(beeping continues)

23:17.096 --> 23:20.129
(suction gurgles)

23:21.701 --> 23:23.402
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,
KAREV?

23:23.402 --> 23:26.506
UH, PATIENT WASN'T CRITICAL,
SO I TOOK THE STAIRS.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.508
Y-YOU DO THAT ALL DAY?

23:28.508 --> 23:30.510
YEAH. IT'S GOOD EXERCISE.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

23:30.510 --> 23:32.512
WELL, THE BIG DEAL IS,
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SWEATY

23:32.512 --> 23:35.414
AND YOU... (sniffs)
AND YOU SMELL.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.487
AND YOU'RE NOT
GOING INTO MY O.R.

23:37.487 --> 23:40.490
WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TODAY?
NOTHING, I-I--

23:40.490 --> 23:43.192
KAREV, YOU STINK.
NOW GO TAKE A SHOWER.

23:43.192 --> 23:44.954
(elevator bell dings)

23:46.856 --> 23:48.157
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

23:48.157 --> 23:49.859
(Mark) OH.

23:49.859 --> 23:52.431
WHAT?
WELL, I THOUGHT I HAD
SOME NORMAL SKIN HERE,

23:52.431 --> 23:55.204
BUT IT'S ALREADY STARTING
TO GROW WARTS.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

23:55.204 --> 23:57.737
(Miranda) IT MEANS, JERRY'S NOT
GOING TO GET HIS SKIN GRAFTS

23:57.737 --> 23:59.168
ANYTIME SOON.

23:59.168 --> 24:01.611
HE'S GONNA HAVE
A LOT OF OPEN WOUNDS.

24:01.611 --> 24:03.613
SO HE WAS RIGHT.

24:03.613 --> 24:05.745
HE IS GONNA LOOK
LIKE FRANKENSTEIN.

24:07.116 --> 24:09.479
(Lexie) MAYBE I SHOULD GO
UPDATE THE WIFE.

24:09.479 --> 24:11.521
YOU KNOW,
PREPARE HER FOR THE WORST?

24:11.521 --> 24:13.523
I MEAN, IF--IF I WERE HER,
I WOULD--

24:13.523 --> 24:15.755
I WOULD WANT TO KNOW
SOONER THAN LATER.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.957
WHICH IS FINE, BECAUSE I'M--
I'M FINE RIGHT HERE.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.990
I'M--I'M JUST SAYING, IF--IF,
YOU KNOW, IF I WERE THE WIFE,

24:20.990 --> 24:24.794
I'D WANT TO KNOW
SOONER THAN LATER.

24:24.794 --> 24:28.538
LATER IT IS, THEN.

24:28.538 --> 24:30.239
(crackles)

24:32.842 --> 24:34.504
(door opens)

24:34.504 --> 24:37.176
I NEED MY MOTHER'S
ENGAGEMENT RING BACK.

24:37.176 --> 24:40.810
CAN I HAVE IT, PLEASE?
(crying) DANNY,
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS, OKAY?

24:40.810 --> 24:43.082
IF I COULD JUST...
SHE DIDN'T CHEAT ON YOU.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.755
YEAH?
SHE DIDN'T.

24:45.755 --> 24:48.117
SHE TOLD US SHE HAS
A FRIEND NAMED JEANETTE

24:48.117 --> 24:50.119
WHO THREW HER
A BACHELORETTE PARTY.

24:50.119 --> 24:52.592
YEAH.
WELL, SOMETIMES
AT BACHELORETTE PARTIES,

24:52.592 --> 24:55.625
THERE'S A SECTION OF THE PARTY
KNOWN AS THE TUPPERWARE SEGMENT,

24:55.625 --> 24:57.496
ONLY IT ISN'T
REALLY TUPPERWARE.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.498
IT'S INTIMATE ITEMS,
AND THERE'S SOMEONE

24:59.498 --> 25:02.532
WHO SHOWS YOU HOW TO USE
ALL OF THESE ITEMS.

25:02.532 --> 25:06.205
SO THE INSTRUCTOR
WAS INSTRUCTING THE ATTENDEES

25:06.205 --> 25:10.509
IN TECHNIQUES FOR, UM,
APPLYING A CERTAIN APPARATUS

25:10.509 --> 25:13.783
TO SOMETHING THAT MIGHT S--
SIMULATE A--

25:13.783 --> 25:16.846
SHE PUT A CONDOM
ON A BANANA WITH HER MOUTH

25:16.846 --> 25:19.619
AND ACCIDENTALLY INHALED IT.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.190
(Gretchen sniffles)

25:21.190 --> 25:23.623
GRETCHEN?

25:23.623 --> 25:25.524
(crying) I CHOKED, OKAY?

25:25.524 --> 25:28.898
AND I THOUGHT
THAT I SWALLOWED IT.

25:28.898 --> 25:30.229
(sniffles)

25:30.229 --> 25:31.861
(laughing)

25:31.861 --> 25:33.603
OBVIOUSLY I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.

25:33.603 --> 25:36.265
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME

25:36.265 --> 25:37.767
ON OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

25:37.767 --> 25:40.209
AND WILL YOU PLEASE
STOP LAUGHING AT ME?

25:40.209 --> 25:43.943
I'M GONNA LOVE
OUR WEDDING NIGHT, OKAY?
(sniffles)

25:43.943 --> 25:46.275
NO MATTER WHAT,
I'M GONNA LOVE IT,

25:46.275 --> 25:48.748
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.249
(whimpers)

25:50.249 --> 25:53.252
(laughing)

25:53.252 --> 25:55.324
(Gretchen) STOP IT.

25:55.324 --> 25:57.186
(Gretchen and Danny laugh)

25:57.186 --> 25:59.228
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:59.228 --> 26:00.790
(Derek) YOU GOT IT?

26:00.790 --> 26:01.961
YEP.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.963
YOU SURE?
BECAUSE I CAN GET IT.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.135
YOU KNOW, I DO THIS
FOR A LIVING.

26:06.135 --> 26:08.297
I KNOW. I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT.

26:08.297 --> 26:11.100
DONE. WOW.

26:11.100 --> 26:14.103
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?
I HAVE IMPRESSED EVEN MYSELF.

26:14.103 --> 26:16.946
SO YOU'RE DONE.
I CAN GO?

26:16.946 --> 26:19.208
I AM DONE.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.950
(trash can lid rattles)

26:23.953 --> 26:26.986
(door closes)
HOW DID SHE
GET PAST HER INTERNSHIP?

26:26.986 --> 26:29.288
SHUT UP.
DEREK, COME ON.
SHE'S A DUD.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.061
SHE WASN'T READY,
AND I PUSHED HER.
YEAH, SHE WASN'T READY
BECAUSE SHE'S A DUD.

26:32.061 --> 26:34.163
CRISTINA YANG SAVED MY LIFE.

26:34.163 --> 26:35.995
SHE SAVED MY LIFE.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.296
I OWE HER EVERYTHING.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.068
GET OUT.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.332
GET THE HELL OUT.

26:44.974 --> 26:47.006
(instruments clatter)

26:48.307 --> 26:51.180
(door opens and closes)

26:59.749 --> 27:03.823
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:05.224 --> 27:06.926
(Jackson) 12 POUNDS.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.898
eBay, HERE I COME.
(Lexie laughs)

27:08.898 --> 27:10.329
DR. GREY.
(laughing) I'M SORRY.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.732
YOU ARE DOCTORS.
(Jackson laughing)

27:12.732 --> 27:15.905
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOCTORS,
CAREGIVERS,

27:15.905 --> 27:17.907
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE
TO HANDLE ANYTHING

27:17.907 --> 27:20.910
THE HUMAN BODY THROWS AT YOU.

27:20.910 --> 27:22.111
(crackles)

27:22.111 --> 27:23.713
(gasps) OH! OH!

27:23.713 --> 27:25.174
OH! OH, GOD!

27:25.174 --> 27:28.347
LOOK RIGHT THERE. A SPIDER.
IT'S A SPIDER. OH! J--NO, NO.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.350
COME ON. SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING,
PLEASE. IT'S A SPIDER.
THAT?

27:31.350 --> 27:33.683
YES! IT JUST CRAWLED
RIGHT OUT OF THAT HORN.

27:33.683 --> 27:35.324
QUICK, KILL IT! KILL IT!
I--IT...

27:35.324 --> 27:37.086
(squishes)

27:37.086 --> 27:38.928
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

27:38.928 --> 27:41.230
OH, THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU.

27:41.230 --> 27:44.393
OH, THANK YOU.
OKAY. OKAY. WHEW.

27:44.393 --> 27:47.697
(woman) DR. HINES
TO LABOR AND DELIVERY.

27:47.697 --> 27:50.239
DR. HINES, LABOR AND DELIVERY.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.013
I WOULDN'T HAVE PICKED YOU...

28:04.013 --> 28:06.255
TO BE A PART OF MY LIFE.

28:06.255 --> 28:09.759
PROFESSIONALLY? SURE,

28:09.759 --> 28:12.762
IF YOU DIDN'T THINK MY FIELD
WAS SO UNINTERESTING.

28:12.762 --> 28:14.693
BUT PERSONALLY?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.695
WE WOULDN'T HAVE PICKED
EACH OTHER.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.098
(flicks cards)

28:19.098 --> 28:22.972
BUT NOW WE'RE FAMILY.

28:22.972 --> 28:26.235
AND THAT MEANS,
I WORRY ABOUT YOU.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.308
(flicks cards)

28:29.308 --> 28:31.710
(smacks table)

ALEX, YOU'VE BEEN
AFRAID OF THE ELEVATOR

40:23.652 --> 40:26.955
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH,
BUT I NEVER SAID ANYTHING

40:26.955 --> 40:28.957
BECAUSE IT'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

40:28.957 --> 40:31.029
AND, JACKSON, YOU WAKE UP
EVERY NIGHT SCREAMING

40:31.029 --> 40:33.201
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NIGHTMARES.
AND, MEREDITH,

40:33.201 --> 40:35.664
YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT CRISTINA
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID

40:35.664 --> 40:38.537
SHE'S NEVER GONNA BE
THE SAME CRISTINA AGAIN.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.609
AND, LEXIE... (laughs)
FOR GOD SAKE,

40:40.609 --> 40:43.772
MARK NEVER THOUGHT YOU WERE
A PSYCHO. HE LOVES YOU.

40:43.772 --> 40:45.544
THAT'S WHY HE STARES AT YOU,

40:45.544 --> 40:47.546
BECAUSE HE CAN'T KEEP HIS EYES
OFF THE WOMAN HE LOVES.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.447
OF COURSE, HE'S NEVER

40:49.447 --> 40:52.651
GONNA SAY ANYTHING 'CAUSE
HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HE CAN.

I WANTED MY FIRST TIME
TO BE SPECIAL,

40:59.528 --> 41:02.460
AND THEN I WAITED TOO LONG,
AND PARTIALLY BECAUSE

41:02.460 --> 41:04.793
I'M PRETTY SURE
GUYS FIND ME ANNOYING.

41:04.793 --> 41:07.796
