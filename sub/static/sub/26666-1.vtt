02:24.259 --> 02:28.194
You're not allowed to be
in here.

02:28.196 --> 02:29.531
It's forbidden.

02:32.468 --> 02:34.200
Who are you?

02:34.202 --> 02:37.204
Timmy.

02:37.206 --> 02:40.140
Where am I?

02:40.142 --> 02:41.341
This is the school.

02:41.343 --> 02:44.280
This is the forbidden zone.

02:45.380 --> 02:47.983
No one ever comes down here.

02:49.551 --> 02:53.152
In the school? How did I get...

03:02.630 --> 03:06.066
You'll get into trouble
if you stay here.

03:06.068 --> 03:09.068
You don't want to get into
trouble.

03:09.070 --> 03:11.506
You better follow me.

03:36.197 --> 03:37.566
What is this place?

03:54.283 --> 03:57.452
Where's my Mummy?

04:10.599 --> 04:11.564
Hey!

04:11.566 --> 04:12.434
Shh.

04:14.236 --> 04:16.272
I have blood on my shirt.

04:21.176 --> 04:22.477
I want my Mummy.

04:24.546 --> 04:28.314
You mustn't cry. Shh. Shh.

04:28.316 --> 04:29.415
Why?

04:29.417 --> 04:31.319
She mustn't!

04:32.688 --> 04:37.389
Hey. Shh. It's alright.

04:37.391 --> 04:39.428
Let's help each other be brave,
okay?

04:44.533 --> 04:48.470
Oh, no, it's too late.
It's heard us.

05:03.684 --> 05:05.120
Oh, no.

05:16.564 --> 05:23.305
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.384
It can't see us as long
as we stay still.

06:00.242 --> 06:01.309
It's gone.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.247
What was that?

06:07.249 --> 06:09.281
They're the Hungries.

06:09.283 --> 06:12.554
Don't let them touch you.
They're sick.

06:17.593 --> 06:19.425
How did I get here?

06:19.427 --> 06:21.827
Doctor Wintercraig!
The patient's name is Melanie.

06:21.829 --> 06:24.564
She suffered a major head trauma
and she is shutting down.

06:24.566 --> 06:27.701
I think we need to activate
a code crimson...

06:27.703 --> 06:29.472
Doctor Wintercraig?

06:31.639 --> 06:33.509
Timmy, where am I?

06:36.345 --> 06:37.446
Timmy?

07:27.295 --> 07:28.463
Gotcha.

07:42.643 --> 07:45.814
Amy... shouldn't you be home?

07:47.316 --> 07:48.781
Well, since you are here...

07:48.783 --> 07:51.317
would you be able to look
in on a patient of mine.

07:51.319 --> 07:52.819
Valerie Stevens, she's in
B ward.

07:52.821 --> 07:54.754
I'm actually heading to my
office.

07:54.756 --> 07:56.790
I have some new information
on David's condition.

07:56.792 --> 08:00.427
Well, that's wonderful, your
office is in Ward B, is it not?

08:00.429 --> 08:04.831
Of course... uh, Valerie Stevens
is the girl with Eisenmenger's.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.632
The resulting pulmonary
hypertension...

08:06.634 --> 08:08.867
is scarring her heart tissue.

08:08.869 --> 08:13.406
I'm afraid we might lose her.
Would you mind?

08:13.408 --> 08:14.673
All right.

08:14.675 --> 08:16.108
Amy, there is more.

08:16.110 --> 08:18.345
Valerie has spoken of having
strange nightmares

08:18.347 --> 08:22.415
about the hospital, might be
relevant.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.552
I'm a Heart Surgeon, Peter,
not a psychologist.

08:25.554 --> 08:27.886
You're a brilliant doctor, Amy.

08:27.888 --> 08:30.790
And the heart and mind
are often confused.

08:30.792 --> 08:34.864
Perhaps you could lay some
clarity... thank you.

08:50.846 --> 08:52.578
They're in the wall, they're
in the walls...

08:52.580 --> 08:54.581
- Valerie? It's okay.
- The walls are on fire.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.850
- You're all right, ssh.
- The walls are on fire.

08:56.852 --> 08:58.451
The walls are on fire!
It's burning! It's burning!

08:58.453 --> 09:00.720
Ssh... it's all right.

09:00.722 --> 09:03.456
I'll burn you alive...
you and your son.

09:09.430 --> 09:12.799
Valerie? Valerie?

09:26.548 --> 09:28.384
Call Doctor Masuta.

10:58.772 --> 11:00.442
Hello?

11:02.077 --> 11:04.977
Somebody!

11:04.979 --> 11:07.715
Somebody help me!

11:14.955 --> 11:16.591
Hello!

11:20.561 --> 11:22.030
Help me!

12:03.103 --> 12:06.107
I'll burn you alive,
you and your son.

12:28.997 --> 12:30.929
Hi.

12:30.931 --> 12:32.999
<i>Thank you for
picking up. Is now a good time?</i>

12:33.001 --> 12:34.900
No.

12:34.902 --> 12:36.034
<i>Was your phone on silent?</i>

12:36.036 --> 12:38.937
Yes, it's on silent.

12:38.939 --> 12:41.106
Amy, you know we need to have
a serious conversation.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.076
I am not discussing this
with you right now.

12:43.078 --> 12:44.677
When are you going to discuss
it with me?

12:44.679 --> 12:46.178
Please can you give me time.

12:46.180 --> 12:48.047
Isaac, I'm not discussing this
with you right now.

12:48.049 --> 12:50.015
You know that we have
a set the rules.

12:50.017 --> 12:51.717
Yes. I'm well aware of the
rules. Fuck the rules.

12:51.719 --> 12:53.686
Our son needs me.

12:53.688 --> 12:57.823
<i>I need you,
Amy. We both need you, Amy.</i>

12:57.825 --> 13:00.094
<i>I can't make this decision
alone.</i>

13:12.040 --> 13:14.075
It seems you still haven't
gone home.

13:22.851 --> 13:24.987
I am sorry about your patient,
doctor.

13:27.789 --> 13:29.855
I did everything I could.

13:29.857 --> 13:31.157
I know you did.

13:31.159 --> 13:34.027
I would expect nothing less.

13:34.029 --> 13:37.730
Your report mentioned that
Valerie...

13:37.732 --> 13:39.065
woke from a night terror.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.003
A bad dream?

13:43.938 --> 13:45.741
She was terrified.

13:47.742 --> 13:50.143
She was crying out that the
walls were on fire.

13:50.145 --> 13:51.679
That I...

13:56.885 --> 13:59.184
That she was burning alive.

13:59.186 --> 14:03.121
So perhaps in her condition,
yes.

14:03.123 --> 14:06.893
I know her little heart was
collapsing, but do you think...

14:06.895 --> 14:12.130
a bad dream was enough to bring
on heart failure?

14:12.132 --> 14:15.069
Such a tragedy to die so young.

14:17.237 --> 14:19.873
So, how is your son going?

14:23.944 --> 14:25.977
Great. I detected some brain
activity.

14:25.979 --> 14:33.219
I'm running some more blood
tests.

14:33.221 --> 14:35.724
And Isaac? How is your
husband coping?

14:37.726 --> 14:41.159
It's late, Peter and I've got to
get back to my research.

14:41.161 --> 14:42.762
If you wouldn't mind.

14:42.764 --> 14:44.033
Very well.

14:49.203 --> 14:52.904
It is curious... the mind.

14:52.906 --> 14:58.244
I wonder if Valerie knew that this section
of the hospital used to be a school.

14:58.246 --> 15:01.684
A troubled teen burnt it down
100 years ago.

15:40.188 --> 15:43.292

16:37.311 --> 16:42.984
Stop. Not one more word in
front of my son.

16:54.228 --> 16:59.298
I am stuck, Peter. I am in this
hell and I don't...

16:59.300 --> 17:03.936
And hell, like heaven,
it's only a story.

17:03.938 --> 17:06.905
Please don't.

17:06.906 --> 17:09.307
Hell exists only in the mind,

17:09.309 --> 17:11.943
It is the place we imagine

If you indulge your grief and
suffering...

17:13.948 --> 17:15.214

David is not dead. He is alive,

17:21.888 --> 17:26.092

anomalies of a level 2 coma.

You and I both know there has
been no cognitive function...

17:36.671 --> 17:39.204
I have been very patient

17:39.206 --> 17:46.278
believing you'd be able to
overcome this stage of denial.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.115
But you haven't.

17:49.117 --> 17:55.221
Amy, I am speaking as a doctor,
but mostly as a friend.

17:55.223 --> 17:59.191
It is time for this to stop.

17:59.193 --> 18:04.262
Your son drowned, it is not
your fault.

18:04.264 --> 18:10.102
It is time you let him go,
let him cross over.

18:10.104 --> 18:15.376

19:30.417 --> 19:34.487
Did I? I'm sorry.

19:34.489 --> 19:38.089
It's okay, Sarah.

19:38.091 --> 19:41.093
You frightened me, too.

19:41.095 --> 19:44.296

I'm Amy.

Melanie, you're in the hospital,

23:06.701 --> 23:09.734
Doctor Wintercraig, she is
shutting down.

23:09.736 --> 23:12.206

23:26.587 --> 23:29.391

24:31.786 --> 24:35.753
Our leader Zac, he's ready
to see you.

24:35.755 --> 24:37.623
Take me to him.

25:08.588 --> 25:10.291
There's been a crime.

25:16.563 --> 25:19.500
Someone has been singing.

25:23.471 --> 25:28.574
Was it you, hey?
Hmm... how about you?

25:28.576 --> 25:31.609
I've been told someone
has been singing.

25:31.611 --> 25:35.849
I know someone has been singing.

25:38.853 --> 25:39.821
No.

25:43.390 --> 25:46.593
And what was he singing? What
was he singing?

25:49.730 --> 25:56.637
I said, what was that
little weed singing?

25:57.905 --> 26:01.608
Hmm hmm hmm hmm.

26:04.677 --> 26:09.414
What is that? Moya, what is
that?

26:09.416 --> 26:13.554
Louder please. Louder!

26:14.888 --> 26:22.496
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.

26:31.771 --> 26:32.671
You like to sing?

26:32.673 --> 26:38.777
Mmm mmm.

26:38.779 --> 26:41.880
You like the basement?

26:41.882 --> 26:44.519
They like to sing down there.

26:48.621 --> 26:50.622
The basement.

26:50.624 --> 26:54.792
No, no, no, please no,
not the basement!

26:54.794 --> 26:58.529
Please no! Please not the
basement!

26:58.531 --> 26:59.833
Catch.

27:04.238 --> 27:05.636
Ahh.

27:05.638 --> 27:07.708
This one's been crying.

27:10.810 --> 27:11.977

27:11.979 --> 27:14.645
What? No. No, please no.

27:14.647 --> 27:17.918
No, no, you let her go.
Let her go!

27:20.988 --> 27:23.725
Please don't. Let me go.

27:24.925 --> 27:26.724
Let her go.

27:26.726 --> 27:28.695
Here she is.

27:41.008 --> 27:45.844
I know this smell. You afraid?

27:45.846 --> 27:47.549
What is her crime?

27:50.550 --> 27:52.518
Have you got a hole
in your head?

27:52.520 --> 27:54.756
Who said you could speak?

28:08.001 --> 28:09.636
No swearing.

28:11.805 --> 28:14.539
Her crime?

28:14.541 --> 28:19.144
I happen to know, she was found
in the forbidden zone.

28:19.146 --> 28:21.547
And...?

28:21.549 --> 28:24.615
Isn't it obvious?

28:24.617 --> 28:26.884
Okay, wow.

28:26.886 --> 28:31.990
She's a big girl... a grown up.

28:31.992 --> 28:33.791
Where's my son, you freak?

28:33.793 --> 28:35.693
Oh yes, of course.

28:35.695 --> 28:41.967
She's a Mummy, too, but not a
very good one from what I hear.

28:41.969 --> 28:46.774
You don't understand where you
are, do you?

28:48.776 --> 28:52.778
You're too pathetic.
You don't understand the rules.

28:52.780 --> 28:54.616
You're too stupid.

28:56.649 --> 28:58.083
Where's David?

28:58.085 --> 29:01.752
You had your chance.

29:01.754 --> 29:08.961
You had more than one...
you failed.

29:08.963 --> 29:11.532
You failed.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.629
Will you be our mummy?

29:53.139 --> 29:54.873
Oh, Mummy.

29:54.875 --> 29:56.874
Well, come on, little corpses.
You want a story?

29:56.876 --> 29:58.809
You want to meet your Mummy?

29:58.811 --> 30:01.846
Come on, let's meet your Mummy
and tell me what is it...

30:01.848 --> 30:04.749
that mummies do best, huh?

30:04.751 --> 30:06.250
What is it?

30:06.252 --> 30:07.952
Tell us stories.

30:07.954 --> 30:11.957
Bingo. They tell us stories.
Wonderful stories!

30:11.959 --> 30:15.259
Of pandas and the nasty raccoon
dogs that eat them.

30:15.261 --> 30:18.763
Will you tell us a story,
Mummy?

30:18.765 --> 30:23.835
You won't need David anymore.

30:23.837 --> 30:27.439
You can be our mummy.

30:27.441 --> 30:29.907
Oh what a wonderful new heaven
we'll have.

30:41.155 --> 30:45.022
What's wrong, what's wrong,
Mummy?

30:45.024 --> 30:48.629
Don't make me rip your head off.

31:08.915 --> 31:12.817
Little panda hides behind
the pale moonlight...

31:12.819 --> 31:17.189
for the raccoon dog has given
him such a fright.

31:17.191 --> 31:20.826
I've lost my way and know
not where to go.

31:20.828 --> 31:26.064
For the raccoon dog has scared
me so.

31:26.066 --> 31:29.334
At the top of the tree,
little panda is aghast...

31:29.336 --> 31:33.939
as a cheeky, golden monkey
swings right past.

31:33.941 --> 31:36.942
The man in the water, he can
help you see.

31:36.944 --> 31:39.981
Take my hand, come, follow me.

31:41.948 --> 31:45.083
Alone, panda waits for the man
in the water...

31:45.085 --> 31:51.222
when from the stream he hears
something slither.

31:51.224 --> 31:55.059
I'm afraid to look, and I'm
afraid to stay...

31:55.061 --> 31:58.329
but where do I run, I've lost
my way.

31:58.331 --> 32:03.268
From the edge of the forest
sneaks raccoon dog...

32:03.270 --> 32:05.205
all nasty and lean.

32:10.077 --> 32:13.912
Doctor Wintercraig?
Doctor Wintercraig?

32:13.914 --> 32:16.080
Doctor Wintercraig?

32:16.082 --> 32:18.849
Doctor Wintercraig?

32:18.851 --> 32:24.155
It's been two years,
Amy. They are anomalies...

32:24.157 --> 32:27.194
anomalies of a level-two coma.

32:30.931 --> 32:33.999
Your son drowned.

32:34.001 --> 32:36.167
It's not your fault.

32:44.011 --> 32:47.878
Sarah says we should
help her.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.015
She wants the Wallwalker.

32:50.017 --> 32:52.150
Sarah says not to be afraid.

32:52.152 --> 32:54.286
But she's the one who
brought him here.

32:54.288 --> 32:56.922
Sarah says she's the one
who can help us!

32:56.924 --> 32:58.025
Shh.

33:01.861 --> 33:05.365
Sarah says she's not asleep.
Sarah says she can hear us.

33:12.839 --> 33:16.307
It's okay, Mummy. It's okay.

33:16.309 --> 33:20.045
Oh-oh.

33:20.047 --> 33:23.050
Shh, they'll hear.

33:35.095 --> 33:43.868
My son is here, isn't he?

33:43.870 --> 33:48.038
Can you help me find him? I
think he's being held somewhere.

33:48.040 --> 33:49.274
We can't help you.

33:49.276 --> 33:52.877
We can't get to him.

33:52.879 --> 33:54.179
Sarah says Jien might know.

33:54.181 --> 33:57.048
Becky, we can't, we'll be
caught!

33:57.050 --> 34:03.221
We'll be burnt alive or, or
we'll be sent to the basement.

34:03.223 --> 34:06.357
I'll protect you.

34:06.359 --> 34:09.393
I'll be like your mummy...

34:09.396 --> 34:11.965
I'll protect you.

34:14.067 --> 34:18.905
Now let's all four of us,
sit down and make a plan.

35:20.033 --> 35:21.335
Wait.

35:39.185 --> 35:40.287
Come on.

35:53.033 --> 35:55.236
Ward A.

36:11.450 --> 36:13.386
Amy.

36:18.357 --> 36:20.026
Isaac.

36:25.164 --> 36:27.100
Are you coming?

36:56.530 --> 36:59.631
Get away from the window.
Get away, Mummy!

36:59.633 --> 37:01.399
What are they?

37:01.401 --> 37:04.569
They're the Weepers, they come
out of the mist.

37:04.571 --> 37:08.138
They always want to get
into the school.

37:08.140 --> 37:11.209
I've never seen so many.

37:11.211 --> 37:15.513
What do they want? Why do they
want to come inside?

37:15.515 --> 37:19.116
They want us.

37:19.118 --> 37:24.024
Once they bite you, you're
theirs. Come on.

37:26.126 --> 37:27.625
What stops them coming in?

37:27.627 --> 37:31.328
The walls protect us. They can't
get past the walls.

37:31.330 --> 37:33.263
- But sometimes they have got in.
- Shh!

37:33.265 --> 37:34.631
Because of Zac and the
Wallwalker.

37:34.633 --> 37:36.436
Shut up, Becky!

37:39.372 --> 37:41.171
What's the Wallwalker?

37:41.173 --> 37:44.577
Come on, we have to go. We have
to keep moving. This way.

37:52.252 --> 37:53.383
Aww, shit.

37:58.158 --> 37:59.426
Fire.

38:01.461 --> 38:02.463
Valerie.

38:09.702 --> 38:11.669
They were not there,
let's get'em!

38:11.671 --> 38:16.241
I'll take the stairs!
Hurry up!

38:16.243 --> 38:18.145
Hide! Hide!

38:59.718 --> 39:01.387
Ahh.

39:04.591 --> 39:06.624
Sarah says to keep running.

39:06.626 --> 39:08.292
Zane's coming.

39:08.294 --> 39:10.662
Come on, quickly!

39:27.479 --> 39:29.446
Jien?

39:29.448 --> 39:31.415
They were here.

39:31.417 --> 39:32.553
Where did they go?

39:34.553 --> 39:35.944
The forbidden zone.

39:35.946 --> 39:37.821
- You two wait here for the others.
- Okay.

39:37.823 --> 39:42.162
I'll go alone. We'll get her.

39:44.430 --> 39:48.234
You know, if Zac finds out,
he will destroy her.

39:55.575 --> 39:57.243
They're not coming this way.

40:14.560 --> 40:17.428
Becky? What's the matter?

40:17.430 --> 40:19.663
Quiet, Becky, it's the rules.

40:19.665 --> 40:21.265
It's all right, Timmy.

40:21.267 --> 40:24.401
Becky, what's the matter?

40:24.403 --> 40:28.473
Sarah hasn't been here before.
She can't find her way.

40:28.475 --> 40:33.278
It's okay. I think I'm making
sense of this.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.712
I think I know where I am?

40:34.714 --> 40:38.283
But we're breaking
so many rules.

40:38.285 --> 40:39.750
Don't worry about the rules.

40:39.752 --> 40:42.356
I think I know where
I might find David.

40:49.562 --> 40:51.498
Come on, let's go.

41:05.377 --> 41:07.345
Come on, Becky.

41:07.347 --> 41:09.316
Sarah says to hide.

41:44.718 --> 41:45.819
It's seen us.

41:49.421 --> 41:51.758
Get down. Hey! Hey!

41:59.566 --> 42:03.303
Come on. Come on.

42:17.649 --> 42:19.919
- There she is.
- Get her!

42:23.890 --> 42:25.857
There, it's a Hungry!

42:25.859 --> 42:28.459
Shoot it. Shoot it, Gerard.
Shoot it.

42:33.499 --> 42:35.835
- Run! Get out of here, now!
- Run!

43:20.513 --> 43:21.781
Mummy.

43:23.515 --> 43:26.653
Mummy, we thought you were gone.

43:33.792 --> 43:35.959
Mummy.

43:35.961 --> 43:37.597
It's okay.

43:39.798 --> 43:42.066
It's gone.

43:42.068 --> 43:44.535
Why are those ones different?

43:44.537 --> 43:46.537
Why can they get in?

43:46.539 --> 43:50.540
They're not ghosts like the
Weepers, they're dead bodies.

43:50.542 --> 43:52.676
They're from the basement.

43:52.678 --> 43:55.946
They travel up here
through the pipes.

43:55.948 --> 43:59.250
That's why we mustn't
turn on the taps.

43:59.252 --> 44:03.988
If they get you, they'll turn
you into one of their own.

44:03.990 --> 44:07.558
You're not meant to let them
see you.

44:07.560 --> 44:10.697
You are so brave.

44:16.970 --> 44:19.270
Sarah says we should go.

44:19.272 --> 44:21.538
Okay then, let's go.

44:21.540 --> 44:22.609
Okay.

44:30.617 --> 44:33.618
They must be going to the
forbidden zone.

44:33.620 --> 44:35.019
We need to go after them.

44:35.021 --> 44:36.888
No way, I am not going down
there.

44:36.890 --> 44:39.526
How about you do it, tough guy?

44:41.294 --> 44:42.859
Whatever.

44:42.861 --> 44:44.530
Wait, I'll come with you.

44:45.698 --> 44:49.633
No, stay with them.

44:49.635 --> 44:54.004
If he misses again and if
there's any more of them...

44:54.006 --> 44:55.876
we'll need someone who can
fight.

44:58.845 --> 45:03.013
Hey, Jien, what did
pretty boy say?

45:03.015 --> 45:06.984
You all go and let Zac know.
I'll wait here.

45:06.986 --> 45:10.624
Whatever. Come on, guys.

45:22.167 --> 45:24.104
It's down this way.

45:39.618 --> 45:42.019
Zac!

45:42.021 --> 45:45.892
Zane let the prisoner
escape.

45:52.932 --> 45:54.765
Where is Zane?

45:54.767 --> 45:59.870
We were attacked by a Hungry,
but Zane killed it.

45:59.872 --> 46:02.910
He went into the Forbidden Zone
after the prisoner.

46:22.894 --> 46:24.564
It's here.

46:28.066 --> 46:29.835
It should be here.

46:33.205 --> 46:36.707
My baby's room, it should be
here.

46:36.709 --> 46:40.076
I know this place. Come on.
I'll show you.

46:40.078 --> 46:41.747
Me, too, come on.

46:53.725 --> 46:55.859
Oh, you made it, oh, thank god.

46:55.861 --> 46:58.261
Get your hands off them!

46:58.263 --> 47:00.730
It's okay.

47:00.732 --> 47:04.701
By now they would have let Zac
know that you've escaped.

47:04.703 --> 47:07.073
I'm no ally to that monster.

47:11.910 --> 47:13.679
We wanted to tell you.

47:14.747 --> 47:15.915
I'm Jien.

47:18.718 --> 47:23.687
Jien... that's a beautiful name.

47:30.028 --> 47:34.667
I'll find them. I don't
need your help.

47:47.013 --> 47:49.182
Well, anything to impress
a girl.

48:00.926 --> 48:02.796
My girl.

48:06.932 --> 48:11.868
Round and round the garden...

48:11.870 --> 48:14.006
like a teddy bear.

48:16.042 --> 48:20.113
One step, two step...

48:23.082 --> 48:24.915
It's all fun and games until
someone...

48:24.917 --> 48:26.819
gets their face burnt off.

48:32.091 --> 48:34.924
Silly Gerard, he didn't even
see us.

48:34.926 --> 48:36.060
Were you afraid?

48:36.062 --> 48:38.028
I was so afraid. So afraid.

48:38.030 --> 48:43.334
You are such a
scaredy-cat, Timmy.

48:43.336 --> 48:46.205
This is my son's room,
I'm sure of it.

48:47.774 --> 48:49.710
Come, look at this.

49:00.252 --> 49:02.852
What is this?

49:02.854 --> 49:05.055
It's to help us remember.

49:05.057 --> 49:07.290
Our shrine.

49:07.292 --> 49:08.959
Remember what?

49:08.961 --> 49:12.866
That, when you die,
you go to heaven.

49:14.801 --> 49:16.803
This was your heaven?

49:20.939 --> 49:23.006
What happened here?

49:23.008 --> 49:28.212
A long time ago, a demon got in.

49:28.214 --> 49:31.281
We thought it was a
Weeper at first.

49:31.283 --> 49:35.118
Yeah, but it was much worse.

49:35.120 --> 49:38.189
He was able to get
through the walls.

49:38.191 --> 49:43.026
He knew the structure and he
knew the points of weakness.

49:43.028 --> 49:45.029
He had powers.

49:45.031 --> 49:47.000
Zac?

49:49.135 --> 49:52.602
Now all we have to
remember is this shrine.

49:52.604 --> 49:54.437
The pictures make us happy.

49:54.439 --> 49:58.908
We are the only ones
who remember.

49:58.910 --> 50:01.044
Everyone else has forgotten.

50:01.046 --> 50:03.149
That's what you were
doing down here.

50:04.617 --> 50:09.986
All the walls were like
this before he came.

50:09.988 --> 50:15.859
Zac wants us to forget,
that's how he keeps his power.

50:15.861 --> 50:17.627
But it's the Wallwalker's fault,
he let him in.

50:17.629 --> 50:20.631
No, it's not his fault,
he didn't know.

50:20.633 --> 50:24.337
He got trapped, trapped
in between.

50:27.272 --> 50:30.341
What is The Wallwalker?

50:30.343 --> 50:33.078
He's been here for such
a long time.

50:35.647 --> 50:38.147
How long?

50:38.149 --> 50:43.153
A long time. He's alone and very
afraid.

50:43.155 --> 50:46.859
He's not like us.
He's stuck.

50:51.263 --> 50:52.930
David.

50:57.269 --> 50:59.238
David?

51:01.673 --> 51:06.676
He can't get free.
Something won't let him out.

51:06.678 --> 51:08.981
He needs help.

51:10.383 --> 51:12.852
We all need help.

51:22.260 --> 51:23.896
David?

51:41.013 --> 51:43.279
David?

51:44.450 --> 51:47.216
David?

51:47.218 --> 51:49.319
Whoa.

51:49.321 --> 51:51.892
She can move the walls.

51:53.191 --> 51:56.292
I knew it. She's not like us.

51:56.294 --> 52:00.229
Sarah knew she could help us.
She has powers, too.

52:00.231 --> 52:03.066
She's not like us.

52:03.068 --> 52:04.937
David?

52:15.981 --> 52:17.917
David?

53:00.225 --> 53:04.194
He's on his way.
He'll destroy you.

53:04.196 --> 53:08.499
And you, he'll burn you,
just like he burnt me.

53:08.501 --> 53:10.500
You've all betrayed him.

53:10.502 --> 53:15.040
Zane, he doesn't need to know,
you don't have to tell him.

53:17.142 --> 53:19.308
Just because you're ghosts...

53:19.310 --> 53:23.550
doesn't mean he can't turn you
into something else.

53:25.051 --> 53:26.482
You know he can.

53:26.484 --> 53:32.992
One way or another... he'll make
you obey.

53:34.660 --> 53:37.493
We don't have to do this.

53:37.495 --> 53:39.398
<i>You</i> don't have to do this.

53:42.301 --> 53:44.133
Let them go.

53:46.671 --> 53:51.174
You can hear them.
See, there's no point.

53:51.176 --> 53:53.544
He's bound to let in the
Weepers. He's done it before.

53:53.546 --> 53:55.314
Don't.

54:22.374 --> 54:24.640
What did he do to you?

54:24.642 --> 54:27.379
Oh no, Zane.

54:50.535 --> 54:53.504
Let them go.

54:53.506 --> 54:58.111
Zane... come with us.

55:02.481 --> 55:07.319
Go, go on.

55:11.256 --> 55:12.923
Come on. Come on.

55:12.925 --> 55:17.761
You have to help Melanie and
Valerie and the others, okay?

55:17.763 --> 55:22.102
You have to be brave...
for their sake.

56:00.638 --> 56:04.544
They... they're not here.

56:10.816 --> 56:13.716
Hey, diddle, diddle, cried the
boy in the middle.

56:13.718 --> 56:19.291
Let's chase and let's play,
my enemies will burn today.

56:21.560 --> 56:26.296
Burn it. What, are you all deaf?

56:26.298 --> 56:28.167
Burn it!

56:55.827 --> 56:57.794
Hurry!

57:06.604 --> 57:08.373
Quickly.

57:14.747 --> 57:19.348
I know Zac will let the Weepers
in. What are we going to do?

57:19.350 --> 57:22.653
Sarah doesn't want to be
a Weeper.

57:22.655 --> 57:25.691
We can't keep running.

57:27.760 --> 57:30.359
If we convince the others to
turn against Zac.

57:30.361 --> 57:34.730
No, they'll never listen.
They're too afraid.

57:34.732 --> 57:40.470
If we stay here, they'll
still find us.

57:40.472 --> 57:44.711
Becky, can you keep running?
Come on, come on!

58:00.926 --> 58:02.426
Come on, Becky!

58:02.428 --> 58:03.863
Sarah's lost!

58:07.098 --> 58:09.501
Mummy, Mummy!

58:11.403 --> 58:12.472
Becky.

58:13.738 --> 58:15.471
Leave them. It's too late.

58:15.473 --> 58:17.808
We can't leave her.

58:17.810 --> 58:19.743
Zac wouldn't hurt her, he won't.

58:19.745 --> 58:23.412
No, he'll use her, he'll use her
doll to find us.

58:23.414 --> 58:25.415
Come on, come on.

58:35.928 --> 58:37.830
It's okay.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.703
Daddy's coming.

58:47.939 --> 58:49.906
Ow.

58:49.908 --> 58:52.779
Becky, Becky, Becky.

58:55.613 --> 58:58.318
Tut-tut-tut.

59:01.452 --> 59:05.921
Sarah says you're going to
hurt me... really bad.

59:05.923 --> 59:08.658
Well, if there's one thing we
all know about Sarah...

59:08.660 --> 59:11.528
it's that she's always right.

59:11.530 --> 59:14.499
Sarah says you won't be able to
hurt me for much longer.

59:18.970 --> 59:20.872
We'll see about that.

59:29.481 --> 59:30.550
No.

59:41.959 --> 59:43.829
She won't be saying much now,
will she?

59:51.002 --> 59:55.408
Little Becky's dolly is now
sick, sick, sick.

59:56.908 --> 59:59.910
Mummy's got more power than you.

59:59.912 --> 01:00:01.881
Shut up, Becky.

01:00:12.825 --> 01:00:16.892
Oh no, no, no, not down there!

01:00:21.633 --> 01:00:22.769
We have no choice.

01:00:26.604 --> 01:00:29.605
No, stop, the Hungries will
get us!

01:00:29.607 --> 01:00:33.446
No one ever comes back
from the basement... no one.

01:00:34.946 --> 01:00:37.550
You said it yourself,
we have no choice.

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:54.733
Shh. Shh.

01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:07.447
Come out, come out,
where are you?

01:01:10.948 --> 01:01:14.850
Boys and girls, come out
to play.

01:01:14.852 --> 01:01:18.754
A Weeper's smile is bright
as day.

01:01:18.756 --> 01:01:22.825
Leave your mother and leave
your keep.

01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:26.863
And join the devils
in the street.

01:01:26.865 --> 01:01:31.667
Come with a whimper or come
with a call.

01:01:31.669 --> 01:01:34.874
Breathe out your bad
intentions...

01:01:37.676 --> 01:01:38.744
Timmy?

01:01:39.944 --> 01:01:41.747
...or don't breathe at all.

01:01:50.155 --> 01:01:51.955
Get them.

01:01:51.957 --> 01:01:53.323
Argh!

01:01:53.325 --> 01:01:54.627
Go!

01:02:05.903 --> 01:02:07.636
It's locked.

01:02:07.638 --> 01:02:11.140
Don't bother, the bodies of the
dead have them now.

01:02:11.142 --> 01:02:16.581
They'll never cross that river.
We have won.

01:02:21.687 --> 01:02:23.823
Unless one of them isn't dead.

01:02:43.841 --> 01:02:50.613
No, don't go down there, Mummy.

01:02:50.615 --> 01:02:54.183
Why do you do that?

01:02:54.185 --> 01:02:55.951
Come on, sit down, Timmy.

01:02:55.953 --> 01:03:02.158
Why do you call me Mummy?

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.761
We have been here for so long.

01:03:04.763 --> 01:03:09.969
They can't remember our
mothers... not anymore.

01:03:13.705 --> 01:03:16.238
I wish you were my Mummy.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.711
Oh, sweet heart.

01:03:32.024 --> 01:03:33.957
What's down here?

01:03:33.959 --> 01:03:39.995
It's a bad place, a dark place.
We shouldn't go down there.

01:03:39.997 --> 01:03:46.669
Only the dead are down there.
You won't find him.

01:03:46.671 --> 01:03:52.207
Your son, he's not down there.

01:03:52.209 --> 01:03:56.145
What are you not telling me?
What do you know?

01:03:56.147 --> 01:03:58.848
How do we get to him?
How do we get into the walls?

01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:02.989
We can't. You trapped him.

01:04:03.921 --> 01:04:05.821
What?

01:04:05.823 --> 01:04:08.124
You wouldn't let him go...

01:04:08.126 --> 01:04:10.926
you kept him trapped
in between the walls.

01:04:10.928 --> 01:04:14.897
And then something else got in.

01:04:14.899 --> 01:04:20.203
Zac. He was waiting, always
waiting.

01:04:20.205 --> 01:04:22.939
Walking with the Weepers.

01:04:22.941 --> 01:04:26.810
He got through the walls when
he found your son...

01:04:26.812 --> 01:04:29.682
and you trapped David forever.

01:04:54.138 --> 01:04:55.904
David, I'm sorry.

01:04:55.906 --> 01:04:57.809
Ahh-ahh-ahh.

01:05:10.988 --> 01:05:14.524
Damn her. Damn her!

01:05:14.526 --> 01:05:16.993
Zac, what's wrong,
what can I do?

01:05:16.995 --> 01:05:19.028
She knows! That bitch,
she knows!

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:22.133
That bitch knows she has
to let that little bastard go.

01:05:28.073 --> 01:05:30.774
Get to the mess hall and get
more weapons.

01:05:30.776 --> 01:05:32.841
Burn everything.

01:05:32.843 --> 01:05:34.343
Watch out for Weepers,
they'll be inside.

01:05:34.345 --> 01:05:36.845
They'll be looking
for cuddles and kisses.

01:05:36.847 --> 01:05:37.980
Weepers, how would they get in?

01:05:37.982 --> 01:05:39.718
You can figure that out.

01:05:42.319 --> 01:05:45.087
We should release the kids
from the cages.

01:05:45.089 --> 01:05:47.727
We'll need all the help
we can get.

01:05:49.026 --> 01:05:51.794
Oh what a goosey, goosey gander,
you are!

01:05:51.796 --> 01:05:54.132
Upstairs and downstairs and
in our lady's chamber.

01:05:58.336 --> 01:06:02.037
We know <i>your</i> ladies are hungry.

01:06:02.039 --> 01:06:03.775
Ha-ha.

01:06:06.178 --> 01:06:08.044
Hey, Zac, you can't leave us.

01:06:08.046 --> 01:06:11.751
I'm a goin' huntin', Ma.
I'm gonna hunt me a sow.

01:06:15.252 --> 01:06:20.156
Do we have to burn everything?
It's so pretty.

01:06:20.158 --> 01:06:23.158
We need to get to the mess
hall... now!

01:06:42.347 --> 01:06:43.915
It's okay.

01:07:04.202 --> 01:07:08.006
Don't go down there, Mummy,
please.

01:07:12.276 --> 01:07:18.448
Do you know what Mummies do
best? We tell wonderful stories.

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:23.653
Climb, little panda,
do not slip or falter.

01:07:23.655 --> 01:07:30.225
Be brave little panda.
Let's find safe shelter.

01:07:30.227 --> 01:07:34.229
Little Panda.

01:07:34.231 --> 01:07:38.667
Show no fear. We cannot stay.

01:07:38.669 --> 01:07:43.341
We must be brave, little panda,
and find our way.

01:08:36.225 --> 01:08:38.897
That has to be the way.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:50.175
It can't be too deep.

01:09:27.278 --> 01:09:31.182
Oh, no, the Hungries.

01:09:48.432 --> 01:09:49.968
I am scared, Jien.

01:09:50.533 --> 01:09:51.537
It's okay.

01:10:50.595 --> 01:10:52.530
Come on.

01:11:02.373 --> 01:11:04.276
We can cross here.

01:11:39.276 --> 01:11:40.742
Stay away from the windows.

01:11:40.744 --> 01:11:43.114
Whatever happens, don't
let them bite you.

01:12:07.372 --> 01:12:08.504
Come on.

01:12:29.561 --> 01:12:32.194
It's shallow enough
here to cross.

01:12:32.196 --> 01:12:34.729
Mummy, I'm scared.

01:12:34.731 --> 01:12:37.532
I'm going to hold on to you,
tightly.

01:12:37.534 --> 01:12:40.305
You don't have to be afraid.

01:12:45.677 --> 01:12:48.443
Look, it's not deep.

01:12:48.445 --> 01:12:52.251
I want you to hold on tight,
okay?

01:12:54.485 --> 01:12:55.754
Okay.

01:12:59.656 --> 01:13:02.491
Okay, Timmy, come on.

01:13:05.296 --> 01:13:08.697
Timmy, look at me, it's okay,
come on.

01:13:08.699 --> 01:13:10.301
Come on, Timmy.

01:13:21.378 --> 01:13:25.483
Now close your eyes, okay,
good boy.

01:13:35.025 --> 01:13:36.591
What's that?

01:13:36.593 --> 01:13:38.329
Close your eyes, Jien.

01:13:55.346 --> 01:13:56.781
Keep hold of me, Jien.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.525
It's okay, come on,
stay with me.

01:14:08.592 --> 01:14:09.858
Agh... bodies.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:11.229
Hurry, Jien.

01:14:17.467 --> 01:14:19.238
I can't open it.

01:14:20.637 --> 01:14:22.573
It's all right.

01:14:32.784 --> 01:14:36.919
Wait here. I'll see if it's safe
and I'll come back.

01:14:36.921 --> 01:14:39.624
Okay. Come here.

01:14:41.426 --> 01:14:42.727
Mummy!

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:27.506
David?

01:15:34.779 --> 01:15:37.316
David?

01:15:40.717 --> 01:15:41.787
David?

01:15:56.601 --> 01:15:58.403
David?

01:16:00.738 --> 01:16:01.839
Zoom, zoom, zoom.

01:16:05.743 --> 01:16:07.510
- You know I can't.
- When are you...

01:16:07.512 --> 01:16:09.478
I can't take the time off,
Isaac, I can't.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.880
- You mean, you won't.
- No, I can't.

01:16:10.882 --> 01:16:12.782
I mean, how long? How long's
it been going on for?

01:16:12.784 --> 01:16:16.751
It's my job. I save lives. Do
you understand that I am needed?

01:16:16.753 --> 01:16:19.654
Yeah and at what expense?
David and I need you.

01:16:19.656 --> 01:16:21.490
Don't make this about David.

01:16:21.492 --> 01:16:24.660
We never see you any more,
your child barely knows you...

01:16:24.662 --> 01:16:26.694
and you are missing the best
years of his life.

01:16:26.696 --> 01:16:28.499
- Mummy.
- David!

01:16:54.592 --> 01:16:55.927
Mummy.

01:16:57.762 --> 01:16:59.661
What happened?

01:16:59.663 --> 01:17:00.865
I found my son.

01:17:03.734 --> 01:17:05.669
I know what I have to do now.

01:17:20.985 --> 01:17:22.687
The Wallwalker is here.

01:17:52.516 --> 01:17:54.582
David.

01:17:54.584 --> 01:17:58.489
Oh... oh.

01:18:05.863 --> 01:18:07.731
I knew I'd find you.

01:18:15.739 --> 01:18:20.478
David? David?

01:18:22.812 --> 01:18:24.913
Maybe he can't remember.

01:18:24.915 --> 01:18:27.816
Just like us.

01:18:27.818 --> 01:18:30.489
He is one of us now.

01:18:36.327 --> 01:18:39.894
Amy, we need to go back
and find Zane.

01:18:39.896 --> 01:18:41.764
We need to fight the Weepers.

01:18:41.766 --> 01:18:44.966
I know Zac would have
let them in to punish us.

01:18:44.968 --> 01:18:47.506
Mummy, we have to go.

01:18:52.976 --> 01:18:54.912
Come on.

01:18:56.913 --> 01:18:58.682
It's okay.

01:19:04.689 --> 01:19:06.825
Let's cross while we can.

01:19:08.124 --> 01:19:10.060
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:19:15.865 --> 01:19:19.867
I've got you. Come here. Come.

01:19:19.869 --> 01:19:21.105
It's okay.

01:19:26.843 --> 01:19:28.078
Come on.

01:19:33.016 --> 01:19:34.685
Right.

01:19:41.958 --> 01:19:43.928
Ahh.

01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:48.566
I am scared.

01:19:56.106 --> 01:19:58.944
Come on, Timmy. Come on.

01:20:05.115 --> 01:20:06.180
Agh!

01:20:06.182 --> 01:20:07.886
Quickly, take David.

01:20:09.419 --> 01:20:11.655
- Argh!
- Mummy, no.

01:20:22.999 --> 01:20:26.971
- Get the children out of here.
- Okay.

01:20:28.271 --> 01:20:29.971
What about you?

01:20:29.973 --> 01:20:31.141
I have to finish this.

01:20:48.159 --> 01:20:49.628
My son is free.

01:20:54.931 --> 01:20:56.967
This ain't no matinee, darlin'!

01:21:00.904 --> 01:21:04.872
You! Jien of deceit.

01:21:04.874 --> 01:21:06.974
Go to hell!

01:21:06.976 --> 01:21:08.743
I'm already there.

01:21:08.745 --> 01:21:10.778
Then what are you waiting for?

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:13.217
Hurry! Get them safe.

01:21:31.802 --> 01:21:32.937
Behind you.

01:21:42.812 --> 01:21:45.246
Leave her alone!

01:21:45.248 --> 01:21:47.885
Little Timmy Tucker sings
for his supper.

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:54.693
You there, no singing.
It's the rules.

01:22:07.238 --> 01:22:09.708
If you wake, you shall
