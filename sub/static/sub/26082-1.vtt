01:29.896 --> 01:32.164
Hey!
That's my van!

02:00.928 --> 02:03.494
<i>Coconut suntan oil.</i>

02:03.496 --> 02:07.498
<i>Every time I smell it, it reminds
me of my first summer on the beach.</i>

02:07.500 --> 02:10.602
<i>It was the mid-80s and my father
had just been transferred</i>

02:10.604 --> 02:14.205
<i>from Chicago to California,
so out we went.</i>

02:14.207 --> 02:16.073
Hey, have you seen Davie Harris?

02:16.075 --> 02:18.210
He was last seen walking
towards the water.

02:18.212 --> 02:20.211
- No, I'm sorry.
- Keep an eye out, would you?

02:27.553 --> 02:32.490
<i>It was like I won a lottery of some
sort, dodged a bullet of doom.</i>

02:32.492 --> 02:35.894
<i>That move to the beach would affect me
in ways I never could have imagined.</i>

02:37.630 --> 02:41.198
<i>My first summer as a junior lifeguard
would spark a love affair with the ocean</i>

02:41.200 --> 02:43.702
<i>that still burns bright today.</i>

02:59.218 --> 03:01.252
Is that your Ripper?

03:01.254 --> 03:02.253
Yeah.

03:03.724 --> 03:06.858
Man, it's real nice, bro!

03:06.860 --> 03:07.992
Thanks.

03:11.532 --> 03:14.098
Kids from around here don't
really have bikes like this.

03:15.135 --> 03:17.269
Yeah, I'm not from around here.

03:21.008 --> 03:22.543
People call me "Minnesota".

03:26.279 --> 03:28.246
Like the city?

03:28.248 --> 03:33.285
Uh, kind of.

03:33.287 --> 03:36.587
- Yeah, okay, Minnesota.
- Okay.

03:36.589 --> 03:37.889
See you later.

03:50.903 --> 03:52.639
Excuse me.

04:03.717 --> 04:05.250
Making the cut by
the skin of his teeth.

04:05.252 --> 04:08.620
Number 17, Doug Mills!

04:10.790 --> 04:13.324
<i>Ever since the principal mistakenly
said I was from Minnesota,</i>

04:13.326 --> 04:14.992
<i>nobody calls me "Doug".</i>

04:14.994 --> 04:17.261
<i>It's always "Minnesota".</i>

04:23.070 --> 04:24.736
Yes!

04:24.738 --> 04:25.703
- Yeah.
- That was awesome.

04:25.705 --> 04:27.905
I really didn't think I was
gonna make it.

04:27.907 --> 04:29.208
<i>This is Woods.</i>

04:29.210 --> 04:33.143
<i>Five months ago when I moved
here, we became fast friends.</i>

04:33.145 --> 04:35.013
<i>You could even say best friends.</i>

04:41.955 --> 04:45.222
So what are you gonna do now?

04:45.224 --> 04:46.693
I don't know.

04:50.763 --> 04:52.299
You wanna go play
Lego at my house?

04:53.299 --> 04:55.667
Um...

04:55.669 --> 04:59.236
I think I was gonna stay out here, I
really like the... the weather and stuff.

04:59.238 --> 05:00.974
Okay, cool, cool.

05:07.246 --> 05:09.347
Yeah, I'm gonna go play Lego.

05:09.349 --> 05:11.715
Alright, man.

05:11.717 --> 05:14.251
- Brothers till the end.
- Brothers as we grow.

05:23.130 --> 05:24.929
Nice one.

05:24.931 --> 05:26.131
See you, Woods.

05:39.813 --> 05:41.282
<i>That's Brooke.</i>

05:42.849 --> 05:47.352
<i>I mean not only is she beautiful, but
she is totally out of my league,</i>

05:47.354 --> 05:50.358
<i>if I even have a league.</i>

05:52.892 --> 05:54.996
<i>What do you say
to a girl like that?</i>

06:01.034 --> 06:02.770
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

06:06.173 --> 06:08.306
Hey, sunshine.

06:08.308 --> 06:10.874
You so sure you don't have
to check the list?

06:10.876 --> 06:12.109
Am I wrong?

06:12.111 --> 06:13.912
No, no, you right on top.

06:13.914 --> 06:16.780
I'm always on top!

06:21.387 --> 06:23.922
Hey, dude.

06:23.924 --> 06:26.023
Hey.

06:26.025 --> 06:29.126
<i>That's Mathis with the glasses and
Terrance with the shaggy hair.</i>

06:29.128 --> 06:31.996
<i>I don't know them,
but everybody knows of them.</i>

06:31.998 --> 06:34.032
See you out there.

06:34.034 --> 06:35.069
Yes, you will.

07:24.450 --> 07:25.984
Oh yeah!

07:48.073 --> 07:50.073
Well.

07:50.075 --> 07:53.279
Aren't we just as chockers
as a centipede's sock drawer?

07:56.215 --> 07:59.984
Any boofhead can swim in a pool.

07:59.986 --> 08:04.155
Any Flaming Galah
can want to do the right thing.

08:04.157 --> 08:05.222
Cactus!

08:05.224 --> 08:06.357
Piece of piss!

08:06.359 --> 08:08.426
Not worth a Zack.

08:08.428 --> 08:10.027
What language is he speaking?

08:10.029 --> 08:11.830
I don't know.

08:11.832 --> 08:13.131
I think it's like Scottish or
something.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.833
...out of their element,
up the creek,

08:14.835 --> 08:18.035
and most often completely
a few roos loose

08:18.037 --> 08:20.304
in the top paddock.

08:20.306 --> 08:23.540
Only one of you know this.

08:23.542 --> 08:25.542
Rest of you, bogan knob-ends,

08:25.544 --> 08:30.013
who haven't pulled a poor
poo-pusher from the water,

08:30.015 --> 08:34.451
I need you coming
like I need a third armpit.

08:34.453 --> 08:37.287
This is making me wish
I didn't actually get in.

08:52.204 --> 08:54.407
I don't think that's
hypoallergenic.

09:08.420 --> 09:11.556
Right now, there are
15 of you norks.

09:11.558 --> 09:16.326
By this time next week,
that number will dwindle.

09:16.328 --> 09:22.599
Some of you will get the chop, some
of you will spit out the dummy.

09:22.601 --> 09:27.638
But some of you
will dig deep enough

09:27.640 --> 09:31.308
and discover the man or woman

09:31.310 --> 09:37.114
that you always wanna be,
was waiting inside you.

09:37.116 --> 09:40.350
It's my job to scare that out of
you mutt polecats.

09:40.352 --> 09:44.955
And I'll tell you what,
I'm as mad as a meat axe.

10:18.091 --> 10:19.190
Uh, Sir?

10:19.192 --> 10:22.292
Who in a buzzard's dingly bitch
are you calling "Sir",

10:22.294 --> 10:23.827
you little bum bandit?

10:23.829 --> 10:26.998
I just wanted to ask if you could maybe
abstain from writing on my back.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.700
I have very sensitive skin and
break out frequently in hives

10:29.702 --> 10:31.134
all over my hands...

10:31.136 --> 10:33.370
Oh, sensitivity?

10:33.372 --> 10:34.372
Oh, crikey!

10:34.374 --> 10:36.040
That's terrible, mate!

10:36.042 --> 10:37.108
Hey!

10:37.110 --> 10:39.145
Is this flamin' gash
of a peckerwood your friend?

10:43.249 --> 10:44.581
Yeah, Woods is my friend.

10:58.999 --> 11:01.199
Welcome to hard times, mate.

11:03.535 --> 11:05.204
Bonzer!

11:08.441 --> 11:10.307
What does it say?

11:10.309 --> 11:13.478
It says "peckerwood's friend".

11:13.480 --> 11:15.646
- What does that mean?
- And go.

11:17.549 --> 11:19.282
You're as dumb
as a bag of rocks.

11:19.284 --> 11:20.154
Go!

11:32.164 --> 11:37.234
<i>The Pacific Ocean
is cold, dark, and deep.</i>

11:37.236 --> 11:40.506
<i>Those first few buoy swims
were terrifying.</i>

11:45.645 --> 11:48.713
I was slow, but Woods?

11:48.715 --> 11:51.118
He was a whole another level.

12:04.798 --> 12:07.333
<i>I think our embarrassment
is what kept us afloat.</i>

12:09.535 --> 12:10.734
No, no, no, mate!

12:10.736 --> 12:12.106
- You're with me.
- What?

12:14.106 --> 12:17.274
Your friend is still not back.

12:19.478 --> 12:21.014
That's your buddy out there.

12:22.615 --> 12:24.284
Give your blood's worth.

12:25.284 --> 12:26.651
Now!

12:35.828 --> 12:38.128
Tell my mama not to cry!

12:38.130 --> 12:40.364
Tell my mama not to cry!

12:40.366 --> 12:42.399
Junior guards, we do or die!

12:42.401 --> 12:44.569
Junior guards, we do or die!

12:44.571 --> 12:46.704
Write my time upon my chest!

12:46.706 --> 12:49.139
Write my time upon my chest!

12:49.141 --> 12:50.841
Junior guards, I did my best!

12:53.112 --> 12:54.311
Up, up, up!

12:54.313 --> 12:55.846
Come on now!
Formation!

12:55.848 --> 12:58.181
Help your buddy!
Help your buddy!

12:58.183 --> 12:59.584
Peckerwood, I'm watching you!

12:59.586 --> 13:00.754
And go!

13:03.122 --> 13:05.124
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

13:08.461 --> 13:10.330
Keep going! Keep going,
I'm watching you!

13:12.332 --> 13:13.632
Alright, alright!

13:13.634 --> 13:17.134
Close race, whose got it? Come on, Scootch!
Dig in, Scootch!

13:17.136 --> 13:20.403
Is it swelling or showing
signs of irritation?

13:20.405 --> 13:21.739
Mathis, watch your form.

13:21.741 --> 13:22.739
78.

13:22.741 --> 13:24.307
79.

13:24.309 --> 13:25.308
80.

13:25.310 --> 13:26.310
Hands behind your head.

13:26.312 --> 13:27.612
Hands behind your head.

13:27.614 --> 13:28.647
Get up, get up!

13:28.649 --> 13:30.815
Champ, you like you're
having a seizure, mate?

13:40.592 --> 13:42.859
30, 31 that a boy, man!

13:42.861 --> 13:44.295
32.

13:44.297 --> 13:46.430
33!

13:56.875 --> 13:58.575
Yeah! Yeah!

13:58.577 --> 14:00.644
You can do it,
Minnesota, come on.

14:00.646 --> 14:02.479
Just jump on... yeah!

14:02.481 --> 14:04.348
Got this dude!
You got this, Minnesota.

14:04.350 --> 14:06.316
Yeah, Minnesota,
don't blow a head gasket.

14:12.891 --> 14:14.624
Back off, man.

14:14.626 --> 14:17.261
- You comin' on strong?
- No.

14:17.263 --> 14:19.397
'Cause I'm ready when you are.

14:19.399 --> 14:20.531
I'm just standing here.

14:20.533 --> 14:21.898
No, back that fuck.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.667
- Okay.
- Hey.

14:23.669 --> 14:24.735
Hold on, I'm leaning in here.

14:24.737 --> 14:26.269
- Hey bro, I think you wanna see this...
- What?

14:26.271 --> 14:27.273
Right here.

14:33.679 --> 14:36.247
<i>Holy shit.</i>

14:36.249 --> 14:37.748
<i>And there it was.</i>

14:37.750 --> 14:41.788
<i>My first glimpse of pubic hair
swaying in the wind.</i>

14:43.789 --> 14:48.926
It was those five pull-ups that taught
me Felice wasn't like the others.

14:48.928 --> 14:51.928
She was a woman among girls.

14:58.237 --> 14:59.369
Alright, alright,
we're moving on!

14:59.371 --> 15:00.841
Come on, get out of here.

15:05.978 --> 15:07.411
I call that the "Bruce Lee".

15:07.413 --> 15:10.580
The Bruce Lee?

15:10.582 --> 15:12.849
Minnesota, that looks like a duck or...
that was like Donald Duck.

15:12.851 --> 15:14.451
Wait, do a... do He-Man or
something?

15:14.453 --> 15:16.789
- He-Man surfing?
- Yeah, surfing.

15:18.991 --> 15:20.858
He-Man's like a better...

15:22.794 --> 15:24.662
- He-Man!
- He-Man!

15:24.664 --> 15:26.464
And the Masters of the Universe!

15:26.466 --> 15:27.697
Universe!

15:27.699 --> 15:28.699
- Uh...
- Oh!

15:28.701 --> 15:30.433
- Hey so...
- Hey.

15:32.538 --> 15:35.306
Ew! Gross!

15:35.308 --> 15:36.673
It's beach tar.

15:36.675 --> 15:39.343
Yeah, I know.
It's pissing me off.

15:39.345 --> 15:42.013
Well, WD-40 gets it off.

15:42.015 --> 15:44.748
That's right.
That's a chemical reaction.

15:44.750 --> 15:45.816
Uh, yeah.

15:45.818 --> 15:47.685
Yeah, whatever.

15:47.687 --> 15:50.488
Uh, hey man, Terrance can be
a bit of a dick sometimes,

15:50.490 --> 15:52.355
but he's cool, you know?

15:52.357 --> 15:53.891
Yeah.

15:53.893 --> 15:56.694
Yeah, so don't sweat that thing
back there.

15:56.696 --> 15:57.862
Okay.

15:57.864 --> 15:59.363
Thanks.

16:06.572 --> 16:08.605
Hey, you're doing that wrong.

16:08.607 --> 16:09.742
Oh!

16:14.579 --> 16:16.782
First of all, you're too far
back on this board.

16:19.885 --> 16:22.585
Right here.

16:24.057 --> 16:26.523
So this back, pop up...

16:31.331 --> 16:35.066
- Back foot back and you balance.
- Yeah.

16:35.068 --> 16:36.669
You try it.

16:42.375 --> 16:43.807
Yeah.

16:43.809 --> 16:45.375
Dude, that was totally Jedi!

16:45.377 --> 16:47.610
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, something like that, man.

16:47.612 --> 16:50.413
You're goofy-footed,
but uh, keep practicing.

16:50.415 --> 16:51.514
You'll get it.

16:51.516 --> 16:52.749
Yeah.

16:52.751 --> 16:55.353
Uh...

16:55.355 --> 16:56.519
Cool.

16:58.658 --> 16:59.824
Mathis!

16:59.826 --> 17:01.024
Let's do it.

17:03.663 --> 17:04.794
These guys aren't so great.

17:04.796 --> 17:07.798
- Hey.
- Yeah?

17:07.800 --> 17:09.433
- Hold on a second.
- Um....

17:09.435 --> 17:10.967
- You see that?
- Pshew!

17:50.877 --> 17:53.744
Hey, you uh, dropped this.

17:53.746 --> 17:54.880
Thanks.

17:57.883 --> 18:00.083
Oh, uh, all the rules for a
beach...

18:07.994 --> 18:09.627
Do you know this guy?

18:09.629 --> 18:11.962
No.

18:11.964 --> 18:14.497
You're Peckerwood's friend,
right?

18:14.499 --> 18:17.834
Uh, yeah.

18:17.836 --> 18:20.838
It's actually Minnesota.

19:28.207 --> 19:29.775
Stop!

19:32.945 --> 19:34.578
Asshole, stop!

19:35.781 --> 19:37.117
Let's bury him.

19:42.522 --> 19:43.924
Leave him alone!

19:54.867 --> 19:56.567
Here to save your girlfriend?

19:56.569 --> 19:58.702
Why you guys
gotta be such jerks?

19:58.704 --> 20:00.803
Tough guy, huh?

20:00.805 --> 20:03.840
Come on, Woods.

20:03.842 --> 20:04.875
Thanks.

20:04.877 --> 20:06.577
It was sort of awful.

20:06.579 --> 20:08.615
See you around, ladies!

20:10.615 --> 20:12.550
You need to get your shit
together, Woods.

20:12.552 --> 20:13.751
We're not little kids anymore.

20:13.753 --> 20:14.885
Okay.

20:14.887 --> 20:15.985
Yeah, I get it.

20:15.987 --> 20:17.687
Okay, good.
I want you to be okay.

20:17.689 --> 20:18.725
Thanks, man.

20:21.627 --> 20:23.159
No, no, no, no.

20:23.161 --> 20:24.261
No!

20:24.263 --> 20:25.295
No, no, no!

20:25.297 --> 20:26.696
No!

20:26.698 --> 20:28.032
No, not my Ripper!

20:28.034 --> 20:29.032
- Are you sure you didn't...
- Oh!

20:29.034 --> 20:30.900
Lock it up somewhere else?

20:30.902 --> 20:32.101
This is my chain!

20:32.103 --> 20:33.270
Shit!

20:33.272 --> 20:36.173
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Trust people!

20:36.175 --> 20:38.042
Oh shit!

20:38.044 --> 20:39.642
Who is that?

20:39.644 --> 20:41.145
Minnesota, don't talk to him.

20:41.147 --> 20:42.646
- Minnesota!
- Hello?

20:42.648 --> 20:43.746
Dude, no!

20:43.748 --> 20:47.120
It's a box, not a cave!

20:49.721 --> 20:52.758
Hey, I didn't ask you to check
me out, you pervert!

20:53.758 --> 20:56.593
- Oh, okay.
- Listen this time.

20:56.595 --> 20:59.796
Rock people, you little shit!

20:59.798 --> 21:04.935
Um, thank you.

21:04.937 --> 21:06.606
That was mildly frightening.

21:09.742 --> 21:11.675
- Dude?
- Yeah?

21:11.677 --> 21:12.810
You need a new bike.

21:12.812 --> 21:14.813
At least, I can keep
track of mine.

21:15.915 --> 21:16.850
Point taken.

21:17.949 --> 21:19.049
Here, you can have it.

21:19.051 --> 21:20.818
No, I don't...

21:20.820 --> 21:22.953
It's warm.

21:22.955 --> 21:24.154
Dude, it's warm.

21:24.156 --> 21:25.292
That's what I said.

21:27.627 --> 21:29.296
Hey, what are you looking at?

21:37.769 --> 21:41.237
Dude, do you like her?

21:41.239 --> 21:42.840
Look, I think you're good at
fighting,

21:42.842 --> 21:44.841
but I'm pretty sure
Terrance can beat you up.

21:44.843 --> 21:46.909
So maybe you should stop.

21:46.911 --> 21:48.712
I don't know.

21:48.714 --> 21:50.680
What do you know about her?

21:50.682 --> 21:52.182
A lot actually.

21:52.184 --> 21:56.654
For starters, I was in 4th grade
when her brother died.

21:56.656 --> 21:57.655
Oh, man.

21:57.657 --> 21:59.259
Yeah, rip tide.

22:05.831 --> 22:08.098
Her dad disappeared after that.

22:08.100 --> 22:08.968
- Ve...
- Shh!

22:12.237 --> 22:14.405
- What?
- Well, what did you just say?

22:14.407 --> 22:17.374
I said her dad
disappeared after that.

22:17.376 --> 22:20.109
I think like he went to Las
Vegas or something.

22:20.111 --> 22:24.083
Then rumor has it that
he just took off after that.

22:31.256 --> 22:33.357
Push-ups,
sit-ups, jumping jacks, too!

22:33.359 --> 22:35.693
Push-ups, sit-ups, jumping
jacks, too!

22:35.695 --> 22:37.895
You never leave the tower to
take a poo!

22:37.897 --> 22:40.030
You never leave the tower to
take a poo!

22:40.032 --> 22:42.166
Runnin' all day
in the scorching sand!

22:42.168 --> 22:44.967
- Runnin' all day in the scorching sand!
- Hey, that really hurts.

22:44.969 --> 22:46.302
Sweatin' all day
just like we planned!

22:46.304 --> 22:49.039
- Sweatin' all day just like we planned!
- Not what I planned.

22:49.041 --> 22:51.007
Swimmin' in the surf
till my eyes bawl out!

22:51.009 --> 22:53.042
Swimmin' in the surf
till my eyes bawl out!

22:53.044 --> 22:55.044
That's what the junior guard
is all about!

22:55.046 --> 22:57.915
That's what the junior guard
is all about!

22:57.917 --> 22:59.449
- Hoorah!
- Hoorah!

22:59.451 --> 23:01.320
Oh God!

23:03.788 --> 23:04.790
There you go.

23:06.926 --> 23:07.794
Yeah?

23:08.460 --> 23:09.996
Oh my God!

23:16.168 --> 23:18.869
I can talk to him.

23:18.871 --> 23:20.404
Come on, man.

23:20.406 --> 23:22.305
- Dude, the bag's got...
- Hey!

23:26.911 --> 23:28.078
Sweetly.

23:28.080 --> 23:28.946
Hey.

23:28.948 --> 23:32.182
Man, uh, I wanna show you
something.

23:32.184 --> 23:33.687
What is it?

23:38.090 --> 23:39.359
Hey.

23:46.465 --> 23:49.198
So Mathis says we can trust you.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.734
Oh, yeah.

23:50.736 --> 23:57.073
I mean... listen, I would say I'm solid
unless I have to like kill anybody.

24:16.227 --> 24:19.128
Holy shit!
"Meet Mindy.

24:19.130 --> 24:22.265
"She likes posing and kittens."

24:22.267 --> 24:25.002
- And I think that mean "pussy."
- Yeah.

24:25.004 --> 24:26.203
Called a "sexual innuendo".

24:26.205 --> 24:27.404
It makes you think, doesn't it?

24:29.108 --> 24:31.340
Why are you guys
showing me this?

24:31.342 --> 24:33.510
'Cause it's... you don't want to
see it, man.

24:33.512 --> 24:34.544
- No, I mean... I--
- Really?

24:34.546 --> 24:36.379
I do.

24:36.381 --> 24:37.548
It's naked chicks, man.

24:37.550 --> 24:39.282
Guys like to look
at boobs and shit.

24:39.284 --> 24:40.551
Yeah!

24:40.553 --> 24:41.551
Just thought you'd
want to see it.

24:41.553 --> 24:45.088
Yeah, I... I-- I do.

24:45.090 --> 24:46.557
Thank you.

24:46.559 --> 24:49.896
Just uh, familiarize yourself
with the material.

25:21.326 --> 25:23.060
Boobs!

25:48.419 --> 25:50.353
Uh, one second!

25:51.489 --> 25:54.190
Uh, yeah, one second!

25:54.192 --> 25:56.092
- What?
- I was getting...

25:56.094 --> 25:57.494
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry.

25:57.496 --> 25:58.962
What... what are you doing in
there?

25:58.964 --> 25:59.832
- Weren't you...
- Nothing, just...

26:01.566 --> 26:03.966
- Ooh!
- Just give me your towel, okay?

26:03.968 --> 26:05.569
- Why?
- Give it.

26:05.571 --> 26:06.573
Ow, my neck!

26:10.376 --> 26:11.440
I'll be back.

26:11.442 --> 26:12.611
Okay, bye!

26:13.946 --> 26:15.111
Your turn now.

26:23.389 --> 26:26.622
<i>The only thing that's gonna make
this boner disappear is cold water.</i>

26:37.468 --> 26:40.637
<i>That was for sure
my fastest buoy swim yet.</i>

26:40.639 --> 26:41.875
Let's go again.

26:54.553 --> 27:00.090
<i>As the summer wore on, I felt like
I was learning to read the ocean,</i>

27:00.092 --> 27:04.695
<i>knowing what to expect,
how to read her face.</i>

27:04.697 --> 27:08.999
<i>I was learning how to talk with
her, how to exist within her,</i>

27:09.001 --> 27:12.171
<i>how to stay afloat when all
she wanted to do was sink me.</i>

27:20.579 --> 27:24.246
<i>Girls on the other hand, that
was gonna take quite a while</i>

27:24.248 --> 27:25.648
<i>to figure out.</i>

27:44.669 --> 27:47.303
What do you think that homeless
guy meant by "rock people"?

27:47.305 --> 27:49.205
I think you should just forget
about that, man.

27:49.207 --> 27:51.207
I mean the reality of you actually
getting your bike back...

27:51.209 --> 27:54.043
What about rock people?

27:54.045 --> 27:59.049
Uh, my Ripper got... got ripped...
ripped off.

27:59.051 --> 28:01.618
Some hobo said something
about rock people.

28:01.620 --> 28:03.086
You think they have your bike?

28:03.088 --> 28:04.487
It's a good place to start.

28:04.489 --> 28:06.356
I don't know.

28:06.358 --> 28:07.493
They're dangerous dudes.

28:11.095 --> 28:12.228
What do you think?

28:12.230 --> 28:13.429
Tell him?

28:13.431 --> 28:14.497
It could be funny.

28:14.499 --> 28:15.499
Alright.

28:15.501 --> 28:17.234
I know these guys.

28:17.236 --> 28:18.502
They buy us beers.

28:19.505 --> 28:21.204
Come by the pier tonight.

28:21.206 --> 28:23.205
- I think they can help you out.
- Really?

28:23.207 --> 28:26.776
But please, don't...
don't blame this on me,

28:26.778 --> 28:28.744
'cause you never know, man.

28:30.181 --> 28:32.182
Okay, what time?

28:32.184 --> 28:34.051
- Mm, about midnight.
- Yeah.

28:34.053 --> 28:36.520
The pier's closed
at midnight, guys.

28:36.522 --> 28:37.587
Come on.

28:37.589 --> 28:39.388
- Thank you.
- No, but...

28:39.390 --> 28:41.090
- Thanks.
- Isn't that illegal?

28:42.127 --> 28:45.227
Later.

29:09.521 --> 29:13.657
<i>I was able to get closer to
Brooke in the water than on land.</i>

29:13.659 --> 29:18.227
<i>But strangely,
I felt even more invisible.</i>

29:18.229 --> 29:21.298
<i>Without saying anything,
she made it very clear</i>

29:21.300 --> 29:23.833
that we wouldn't
be talkin' out there,

29:23.835 --> 29:27.404
<i>at least not until I'd caught a
wave worth talking about.</i>

29:40.384 --> 29:42.185
Come on man, I spent
a fortune on that.

29:42.187 --> 29:43.552
No!

29:45.524 --> 29:47.325
Stop!

29:49.861 --> 29:50.860
Yeah.

29:50.862 --> 29:52.262
No!

29:52.264 --> 29:53.832
No, Minnesota!

29:57.835 --> 29:58.869
Dude?

29:58.871 --> 29:59.869
Minnesota?

29:59.871 --> 30:01.271
Dude, you okay?

30:05.744 --> 30:07.476
Hey, thanks for saving me.

30:19.824 --> 30:21.491
- Come on!
- Yeah.

30:21.493 --> 30:23.162
Yeah, I... I-- I'm coming.

31:26.425 --> 31:27.957
Let me out of here!

31:45.274 --> 31:46.545
Look at this rebel.

32:28.754 --> 32:29.621
Hey.

32:31.756 --> 32:32.624
Hey.

32:34.892 --> 32:35.992
Are you okay?

32:35.994 --> 32:36.993
Yeah.

32:36.995 --> 32:40.629
Yeah, just uh, lost in thought.

32:43.768 --> 32:48.504
You can talk to me if you want.

32:48.506 --> 32:51.507
About you know, your brother.

32:51.509 --> 32:54.010
- I know you miss him.
- Minnesota.

32:54.012 --> 32:55.477
No.

33:28.513 --> 33:29.515
Hey.

33:30.815 --> 33:35.385
This... this is mine now.

33:35.387 --> 33:38.655
Trade.

33:38.657 --> 33:39.955
See you later, Minnesota.

34:07.552 --> 34:08.516
Wakey-wakey!

34:08.518 --> 34:10.588
You having a little bit of a
moment there.

34:12.822 --> 34:15.091
Who are you?

34:15.092 --> 34:18.860
We uh... we met down on the...
on The Strand.

34:18.862 --> 34:19.731
We did?

34:21.699 --> 34:23.699
I don't remember that.

34:23.702 --> 34:26.936
Yeah, you... you liked my uh... my
Ripper.

34:26.938 --> 34:27.969
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

34:27.972 --> 34:29.539
- Fancy bike.
- Mmhmm.

34:29.541 --> 34:30.539
I recognize you now.

34:30.541 --> 34:32.074
- Yeah.
- Mmhmm.

34:32.077 --> 34:33.842
This is my brother, Pans.

34:33.844 --> 34:35.879
Right, Pots and Pans.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.012
Yeah.

34:38.882 --> 34:40.949
Tell P and P about your problem.

34:40.952 --> 34:42.484
You got a problem?
What kind of problem?

34:42.485 --> 34:43.620
You need someone knocked around?

34:43.621 --> 34:44.754
- Stabbed?
- Capped?

34:44.755 --> 34:45.821
Are you guys serious?

34:48.893 --> 34:51.494
Who's fucking with you, bro,
huh?

34:51.496 --> 34:54.467
I heard something
about uh, rock people.

34:55.467 --> 34:56.764
Fuck you.

34:56.766 --> 34:58.200
Rock people?

34:58.202 --> 35:01.171
Who the fuck is goin' around here
talking to you about rock people?

35:01.173 --> 35:03.773
Was it the fuck who
lives in the box?

35:03.775 --> 35:06.608
He was in a box
at the time, yeah.

35:06.610 --> 35:08.178
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright.

35:08.180 --> 35:09.512
He would know.

35:09.514 --> 35:11.747
Yeah.

35:11.749 --> 35:12.849
Alright, look.

35:12.851 --> 35:14.751
There is this guy, alright?

35:14.753 --> 35:17.187
He lives way, way,
way, way out there.

35:17.189 --> 35:19.055
He's like the head of the whole
thing, right?

35:20.325 --> 35:22.191
He knows about everything that
comes in and out of this town.

35:22.193 --> 35:24.160
- Everything.
- Everything.

35:24.162 --> 35:27.129
Murderers, drugs, sex slaves.

35:27.131 --> 35:28.131
Do you like sex slaves?

35:28.133 --> 35:30.600
I just wanna find my bike.

35:30.602 --> 35:32.501
Hmm.

35:32.503 --> 35:35.637
Alright, well, the Rock God
would know.

35:35.639 --> 35:36.872
The Rock God would know.

35:36.874 --> 35:43.479
So uh, can you help me out then?

35:43.481 --> 35:46.483
I mean...

35:46.485 --> 35:47.816
- Listen, listen...
- Mmhmm

35:48.954 --> 35:51.086
We could get that ship out.

35:51.088 --> 35:52.088
Alright.

35:52.890 --> 35:55.158
- We'll help you.
- Yeah, mmhmm.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.193
You just gotta do one more
favor for us first, alright?

35:57.195 --> 35:58.894
Just a little.

35:58.896 --> 36:00.562
There's this house down
on The Strand, alright?

36:00.564 --> 36:01.530
You can't miss it.

36:01.532 --> 36:03.832
- It's huge, it's beautiful.
- Epic place.

36:03.834 --> 36:05.100
This the guy, The Yiz, lives
there.

36:05.102 --> 36:06.269
Sleaze ball.

36:06.271 --> 36:08.704
Super famous in the music
industry, he's good loaded.

36:08.706 --> 36:11.707
Anyway, on the second deck of
his house, he's got a pot on it.

36:11.709 --> 36:13.977
My fuckin' pot,
which he never paid me for.

36:13.979 --> 36:17.079
Just grab the plant
and bring it back to us.

36:17.081 --> 36:19.849
You do that,
we take you to see the Rock God.

36:19.851 --> 36:22.251
So yeah, I've got a question.

36:22.253 --> 36:23.852
This guy has your bike, right?

36:23.854 --> 36:27.856
No, this guy has
a marijuana plant.

36:27.858 --> 36:29.526
Wait, marijuana?

36:29.528 --> 36:31.260
It's not for me, it's for Pots.

36:31.262 --> 36:35.798
The kid who will take me to the guy
who probably knows where my bike is.

36:35.800 --> 36:39.135
Give me that for a sec.

36:39.137 --> 36:40.805
Got sand in it, dude.

36:43.140 --> 36:45.274
Dude, this guy looks
like he can kill you!

36:45.276 --> 36:47.943
- So what?
- So what, dude!

36:47.945 --> 36:50.879
I don't think this is ethical!

36:50.881 --> 36:54.249
It's not, Woods.
It's illegal.

36:54.251 --> 36:57.019
Dude, my dad will kill me
if I get busted.

36:57.021 --> 36:57.988
You're not gonna
get busted, okay?

36:57.990 --> 37:01.157
You're just gonna stand
out here and watch.

37:01.159 --> 37:03.892
And if it looks like they see
me, you'll make a sound.

37:03.894 --> 37:06.296
Wait a second.

37:06.298 --> 37:09.298
By me making a sound
to indicate to you

37:09.300 --> 37:11.700
the pending discovery
of your lawlessness

37:11.702 --> 37:14.637
would make me...
would make me an accessory,

37:14.639 --> 37:16.573
so that means that if you get
caught, then I get caught.

37:16.575 --> 37:18.575
I can't believe you.

37:18.577 --> 37:22.778
All the times I stood up for
you, man.

37:22.780 --> 37:24.148
Okay.

37:39.863 --> 37:42.631
Yeah?

37:42.633 --> 37:44.633
Yeah, I can't really talk
business right now,

37:44.635 --> 37:46.635
I'm walking into a recording
session.

37:46.637 --> 37:48.271
I'm about to pull out the mic.

37:49.340 --> 37:54.744
Oh Barry, it's not even a good
time to pop over.

37:54.746 --> 37:58.615
I'm looking for a ménage à trois,
buddy, not a jazz quartet.

38:12.030 --> 38:13.363
Yiz!

38:13.365 --> 38:14.832
Where's Yiz?

38:18.936 --> 38:20.705
Looking hot, ladies.

38:24.242 --> 38:27.644
What the hell was that?

38:27.646 --> 38:29.812
- Oh!
- Hey there, cutie.

38:29.814 --> 38:31.650
Yiz is gonna kill you.

38:37.389 --> 38:40.124
You better get those nasty feet
off my bed, you punk.

38:45.262 --> 38:46.729
Hey!

38:46.731 --> 38:48.698
I'm getting my bike back.

38:54.738 --> 38:56.271
Kid!

38:56.273 --> 38:58.941
Hey, stop!

38:58.943 --> 39:01.711
I will find you
and I will kill you!

39:01.713 --> 39:03.713
I'm sorry for this!

39:03.715 --> 39:05.381
Oh!

39:05.383 --> 39:07.352
- My towel!
- Little turd!

39:09.688 --> 39:11.153
Nothing to see here.

39:15.260 --> 39:16.358
Hey, look, it's pretty
hot out here.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.695
I was just thinking
maybe you need some sunscreen.

39:18.697 --> 39:20.028
Oh, yeah, sure.

39:20.030 --> 39:21.597
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39:21.599 --> 39:25.767
It's really important than that, like
the sun is exceptionally hot out here.

39:25.769 --> 39:27.769
Cannot be too careful.

39:27.771 --> 39:29.004
That's right, I'll take a cut.

39:29.006 --> 39:30.773
Pain in the ass.

39:30.775 --> 39:33.975
You know, my brother here Pans
is a great masseuse.

39:33.977 --> 39:35.178
- Really?
- Would you like a massage?

39:35.180 --> 39:37.280
- Oh, sure.
- We'll take turns.

39:37.282 --> 39:39.048
You're gonna get tan lines
with these.

39:39.050 --> 39:40.716
Oh my God!
Get up, get up, get up!

39:40.718 --> 39:41.651
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- Bye.

39:41.653 --> 39:43.151
Thank you, Mackenzie.
Thank you so much.

39:43.153 --> 39:44.320
Come on, walk.
Let's go home.

39:44.322 --> 39:46.189
Bye, Mackenzie.
Nice to meet you.

39:46.191 --> 39:47.457
Holy shit!

39:48.394 --> 39:50.158
- Are you out of your mind?
- I did it.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.294
Are you out of your mind?

39:51.296 --> 39:53.162
I got it. Yeah.

39:53.164 --> 39:54.930
In broad daylight?

39:54.932 --> 39:57.033
You guys asked me to get the
plant, right?

39:57.035 --> 40:00.169
- Yes, not bring it to the beach!
- I... I got it.

40:00.171 --> 40:01.204
I held up... I held up my end of
the deal.

40:01.206 --> 40:02.204
Are you serious?

40:02.206 --> 40:03.271
- Here.
- Take off your shirt.

40:03.273 --> 40:05.410
- Here.
- Take your shirt off.

40:11.416 --> 40:13.216
Hide this.

40:13.218 --> 40:14.617
Where?

40:14.619 --> 40:18.220
I don't care if you smoke the whole
thing, get it off the beach.

40:19.957 --> 40:22.959
So are we going to see Rock God?

40:22.961 --> 40:26.095
You've lost your nut,
kid, over a bike.

40:26.097 --> 40:28.363
- You're taking me or not?
- Yeah, come on.

40:28.365 --> 40:31.169
- Right now?
- Yeah, no time like the present.

40:45.849 --> 40:49.385
Oh, this is about
as far as I go.

40:49.387 --> 40:50.787
You'll be alright though.

40:50.789 --> 40:53.189
What?

40:53.191 --> 40:57.392
You said I could...
you'd take me to the Rock God.

40:57.394 --> 40:59.461
This is just you know,
as far as I go.

40:59.463 --> 41:01.129
He's out there.

41:01.131 --> 41:02.999
How am I supposed to find him?

41:03.001 --> 41:04.499
You got it.

41:04.501 --> 41:06.001
Okay.

41:06.003 --> 41:09.939
Just stay focused, alright?

41:09.941 --> 41:12.073
Don't fall off the rocks.

41:12.075 --> 41:12.977
Good luck.

41:13.544 --> 41:15.010
I'll see you around, Minnesota.

41:15.012 --> 41:16.379
Man!

41:16.381 --> 41:18.417
Just keep going
that way, you know.

42:12.903 --> 42:14.206
Excuse me!

42:18.142 --> 42:19.011
Hey.

42:21.144 --> 42:25.347
Uh, I'm looking for someone.

42:25.349 --> 42:28.084
These guys sent me out here.

42:28.086 --> 42:32.488
Not too many people out here,
just the way I like it.

42:32.490 --> 42:33.923
Right.

42:33.925 --> 42:37.492
Uh, this guy would probably
stand out.

42:37.494 --> 42:39.028
Yeah?

42:39.030 --> 42:40.229
Yeah.

42:40.231 --> 42:42.367
Uh, they call him
the "Rock God".

42:45.503 --> 42:46.903
What?

42:46.905 --> 42:48.970
The Rock God!

42:50.642 --> 42:52.211
The Rock God?

42:54.378 --> 42:57.946
Well, from what I've heard

42:57.948 --> 43:02.251
nobody has ever really
seen the Rock God!

43:02.253 --> 43:03.486
So you... you've heard of him?

43:03.488 --> 43:05.387
Heard of him, yeah.

43:05.389 --> 43:07.590
Whispers, here and there, yeah.

43:07.592 --> 43:11.227
Travel with wind and
ride on the waves.

43:12.396 --> 43:15.664
Think you could uh,
talk to him for me?

43:15.666 --> 43:18.066
Rock God?

43:18.068 --> 43:19.669
I lost my bike.

43:19.671 --> 43:23.942
I think it got stolen or
something.

43:26.010 --> 43:29.945
My name's Minnesota.

43:29.947 --> 43:34.350
Mmm!

43:34.352 --> 43:37.218
I'm placing you in my head.

43:37.220 --> 43:39.488
Yeah, getting

43:39.490 --> 43:41.490
a bigger picture.

43:41.492 --> 43:43.425
Minnesota.

43:43.427 --> 43:45.361
Minnesota?

43:45.363 --> 43:49.131
You know, that's a Lakota word and
people full of shit will tell you

43:49.133 --> 43:53.568
it means "the land of the
sky-blue waters."

43:53.570 --> 43:57.006
That's all some bullshit
to sell real estate.

43:57.008 --> 44:00.575
What it really means is
"the land of murky water".

44:00.577 --> 44:02.577
You feel like murky water.

44:02.579 --> 44:04.180
Um, I'm really not
following you.

44:04.182 --> 44:06.582
Your name, Minnesota.

44:06.584 --> 44:07.550
Minnesota.

44:07.552 --> 44:10.986
Oh yeah, that...
that's not really my name.

44:10.988 --> 44:13.388
But you gotta filter that water.

44:13.390 --> 44:14.791
It's important.

44:14.793 --> 44:19.428
Let it run through the stream, down
the waterfalls, out to the ions,

44:19.430 --> 44:21.066
and into the sea.

44:24.334 --> 44:27.068
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

44:27.070 --> 44:28.940
Yeah.

44:31.742 --> 44:33.608
Uh, thanks.

44:33.610 --> 44:35.745
Yeah.

44:35.747 --> 44:38.347
So uh...

44:38.349 --> 44:40.216
- Hey.
- My... my bike.

44:40.218 --> 44:43.285
We knew we were
gonna meet, right?

44:43.287 --> 44:48.591
It's written in the stars.

44:48.593 --> 44:50.626
Wait, wait, wait.

44:50.628 --> 44:52.028
Look at me.

44:57.367 --> 45:01.637
I can see your path
much clearer now.

45:01.639 --> 45:02.571
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:02.573 --> 45:05.307
You're struggling
to understand, right?

45:05.309 --> 45:10.445
Listen, you gotta understand
there's nothing to understand.

45:10.447 --> 45:15.050
It's all some testosterone
mixing with social pressure.

45:15.052 --> 45:18.053
But you do have the chance
of a cosmic do-over.

45:18.055 --> 45:20.655
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:20.657 --> 45:22.490
Check it, over there.

45:22.492 --> 45:23.526
My bike?

45:35.072 --> 45:36.238
This?

45:36.240 --> 45:38.110
Yep!

45:41.412 --> 45:42.812
Like it?

45:42.814 --> 45:44.747
Well, it's not a bike.

45:44.749 --> 45:49.251
But it's something to get around
on until the planets align

45:49.253 --> 45:54.657
and the universe reveals itself
upon you.

45:56.293 --> 45:58.160
Thanks.

45:58.162 --> 46:00.829
Anytime, anywhere, anyhow.

46:00.831 --> 46:03.768
We'll meet again, Minnesota.

46:05.836 --> 46:06.704
Don't lose that.

47:05.363 --> 47:06.498
Hey, Minnesota.

47:08.231 --> 47:09.834
Not gonna come
over and say "hi"?

47:14.771 --> 47:16.204
Hi.

47:16.206 --> 47:17.241
Hey.

47:20.577 --> 47:27.515
It was a... a gift, I guess,
along with the skateboard.

47:27.517 --> 47:28.783
It's from the Rock God.

47:28.785 --> 47:29.785
Rock God?

47:29.787 --> 47:30.785
Yeah.

47:30.787 --> 47:33.354
I've never met anyone
who's met the Rock God.

47:33.356 --> 47:36.858
Yeah, well, it's mostly just
confusing.

47:38.863 --> 47:40.930
What are you...
what are you doing?

47:40.932 --> 47:45.270
You know, just wasting my youth.

47:48.773 --> 47:51.240
You afraid, Minnesota?

47:51.242 --> 47:52.675
Of what?

47:52.677 --> 47:55.276
What comes next?

47:55.278 --> 47:57.780
All these choices we have?

47:57.782 --> 48:00.615
I just wanna get through...
today, honestly.

48:00.617 --> 48:02.550
Come on.

48:02.552 --> 48:04.820
Let's get into some trouble.

48:04.822 --> 48:06.387
Now?

48:06.389 --> 48:10.425
I'm afraid it's a
limited time offer.

48:10.427 --> 48:12.494
Who knows who
I'll be in an hour?

48:14.698 --> 48:15.834
You mean "where".

48:17.635 --> 48:19.300
No.

48:19.302 --> 48:20.704
No, I don't.

48:31.715 --> 48:32.583
What?

48:35.852 --> 48:38.322
Just making sure you know,
what you're doing.

48:53.436 --> 48:54.470
What's going on?

48:54.472 --> 48:55.874
Hey.

49:01.746 --> 49:04.345
Let's get out of here.

49:04.347 --> 49:05.613
Alright.

50:03.773 --> 50:05.276
There's no answers
down there, mate.

50:06.543 --> 50:08.811
Look at me.

50:08.813 --> 50:11.814
Oh-ho, there he is.

50:11.816 --> 50:13.816
The big heavy rocks.

50:13.818 --> 50:16.818
I'm not quitting!

50:16.820 --> 50:18.820
We'll see.

50:18.822 --> 50:20.088
Get in line.

50:25.061 --> 50:29.030
Today, Friday, holiday weekend!

50:29.032 --> 50:31.834
Happy birthday, America!

50:31.836 --> 50:37.573
So let's have some two-pot screamers and
a whole heap of out-of-control idiots

50:37.575 --> 50:39.841
completely off their tits.

50:39.843 --> 50:41.676
Lucky Tony.

50:41.678 --> 50:44.780
Where did you get the board?

50:44.782 --> 50:46.981
The guy in the rocks.

50:46.983 --> 50:49.117
He said he was
gonna find my bike.

50:49.119 --> 50:54.726
Now we, the junior lifeguards, are
going to prepare our CPR skill!

50:55.726 --> 50:56.725
The Rock God?

50:56.727 --> 50:58.861
He's actually real?

50:58.863 --> 51:00.129
Yeah.

51:00.131 --> 51:04.466
The board is mine until the
universe reveals itself to me.

51:04.468 --> 51:06.602
You don't make sense anymore.

51:06.604 --> 51:08.137
What?
What does that mean?

51:08.139 --> 51:11.407
Alcohol and water do not mix.

51:11.409 --> 51:12.740
You're running drugs,
you're breaking...

51:12.742 --> 51:14.609
I'm running with drugs!

51:14.611 --> 51:15.711
Important difference.

51:15.713 --> 51:20.082
Now we are going to talk
about a little situation.

51:20.084 --> 51:22.483
What do you want from me, man?

51:22.485 --> 51:25.421
Say you're still in there.

51:25.423 --> 51:27.459
Say you're my best friend.

51:28.492 --> 51:30.425
Bros as we grows.

51:30.427 --> 51:33.562
A situation involving

51:33.564 --> 51:38.499
a flowery little girl.

51:39.602 --> 51:41.836
This is not any girl.

51:41.838 --> 51:43.171
No, no, no, no!

51:43.173 --> 51:47.041
This particular girl
is a preggy Sheila.

51:48.778 --> 51:52.113
Now, shirt off, assume the posy.

52:01.925 --> 52:05.193
Today, we are saving two lives.

52:05.195 --> 52:09.631
Without oxygen,
a woman and her baby will die.

52:09.633 --> 52:13.167
Here it is.

52:13.169 --> 52:16.905
Now, it's very important
that we don't smash up

52:16.907 --> 52:19.475
the poor little
bugger inside, yes?

52:19.477 --> 52:25.914
So we take our time and we apply
the pressure above the baby.

52:25.916 --> 52:27.448
Good, right.

52:27.450 --> 52:32.086
Now, Champ, Peckerwood demonstrate,
break off into groups, back in five.

52:32.088 --> 52:33.955
- Who wants to go first?
- I will.

52:38.095 --> 52:39.227
Let's get on with this.

52:39.229 --> 52:41.562
Yeah.

52:44.635 --> 52:45.633
What?

52:47.537 --> 52:49.037
Hey man, you got a problem?

52:49.039 --> 52:50.838
Yes, I'm mad!

52:50.840 --> 52:52.039
I'm mad as hell.

52:52.041 --> 52:53.575
Yeah, I can see that.

52:53.577 --> 52:54.575
You don't have to
take it out on me.

52:54.577 --> 52:55.544
It's because of you!

52:55.546 --> 52:56.678
Well, what you want me to do
about it, huh?

52:56.680 --> 52:59.046
I don't know. I just want things
to go back to normal.

52:59.048 --> 53:00.916
Well, that's never
gonna happen, alright?

53:00.918 --> 53:02.084
And that's normal.

53:02.086 --> 53:04.919
Normal people grow up, Woods.

53:04.921 --> 53:07.823
Normal people notice girls,
okay?

53:07.825 --> 53:09.928
Normal people
get fucking normal!

53:15.131 --> 53:16.798
You don't think I'm normal?

53:25.809 --> 53:27.943
Screw you!

55:44.280 --> 55:45.280
Come here!

55:47.950 --> 55:50.885
Hey, what you got
my board for, huh?

55:50.887 --> 55:52.754
You fucking prick.

55:52.756 --> 55:54.990
Nice glasses.

55:54.992 --> 55:56.024
Yeah.

55:56.026 --> 55:57.758
It makes yous
look good, brudda.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.260
Feels good.

55:59.262 --> 56:00.361
What are you doing here?

56:07.371 --> 56:10.104
Say cheese, dickhead.

56:15.178 --> 56:16.278
Ha-ha!

56:16.280 --> 56:17.915
Minnesota! Come on!

56:31.928 --> 56:33.260
High five.

56:33.262 --> 56:34.729
Outrage.

56:34.731 --> 56:36.330
- That was crazy!
- Outrage.

56:36.332 --> 56:37.399
You got me crazy.

56:37.401 --> 56:38.934
Oh, you are a lucky boy.

56:38.936 --> 56:40.202
Those guys are humungous.

56:40.204 --> 56:42.303
They can just... they'll just sit
on you.

56:42.305 --> 56:43.939
It's happened to Pans.

56:43.941 --> 56:45.173
- Do you remember?
- It's true.

56:45.175 --> 56:46.807
Yeah.

56:46.809 --> 56:48.309
Worst day in my life.

56:48.311 --> 56:49.111
It wasn't a good day.

56:49.113 --> 56:50.912
You stole the wrong board,
buddy.

56:50.914 --> 56:52.314
I didn't steal it.

56:52.316 --> 56:53.282
It was given to me.

56:53.284 --> 56:54.350
Well, look, you gotta straighten
somebody up,

56:54.352 --> 56:56.417
because people are tryin'
to have you killed now.

56:56.419 --> 56:58.086
You gotta get street-smart.

56:59.088 --> 57:00.088
Thanks for saving my ass.

57:01.025 --> 57:03.358
Look, we just
hate those guys, alright?

57:03.360 --> 57:05.827
You're not so bad,
but we go way back with them.

57:05.829 --> 57:08.095
- It had nothing to do with you really.
- Honestly.

57:08.097 --> 57:10.298
We're just defending our
country.

57:10.300 --> 57:11.899
They're Hawaiians, right?

57:11.901 --> 57:13.236
- Shut up!
- No.

57:17.307 --> 57:18.305
Alright!

57:27.117 --> 57:28.316
Come on!

57:28.318 --> 57:30.385
There's the start,
there's the start!

57:30.387 --> 57:32.787
<i>The ocean had warmed up.</i>

57:32.789 --> 57:34.856
<i>My mind was now
at ease swimming</i>

57:34.858 --> 57:38.093
<i>and I could feel the water glide
across my body.</i>

57:38.095 --> 57:40.361
<i>It felt fast.</i>

57:40.363 --> 57:42.463
<i>I wasn't scared of the depth
anymore.</i>

57:42.465 --> 57:44.064
Yes, yes, yes. Heave!

57:44.066 --> 57:46.100
<i>It felt like I belonged.</i>

57:54.544 --> 57:59.814
The ocean is about
peace and strength.

57:59.816 --> 58:03.484
It's about focus and clarity in
your head.

58:03.486 --> 58:05.486
It's about strength and
fortitude in your body.

58:05.488 --> 58:06.421
Am I right?

58:06.423 --> 58:07.421
Yes, Tony!

58:07.423 --> 58:08.957
You know that I'm right.

58:08.959 --> 58:13.829
Now, and sometimes the ocean just flat
out goes Vegas Baby and pays you.

58:13.831 --> 58:15.296
Alright?

58:15.298 --> 58:20.001
Now, how about
you little wannabes dive down,

58:20.003 --> 58:23.437
get your good old Uncle Tony, a
fistful of sand dollars, alright?

58:23.439 --> 58:24.405
Yeah.

58:24.407 --> 58:25.974
And then you get to
enjoy your afternoon.

58:27.311 --> 58:28.843
Alright?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:28.845 --> 58:29.878
So why are we still here?

58:29.880 --> 58:31.379
Come on, go, go, go!

59:02.945 --> 59:04.613
Now, here's a gopher.

59:04.615 --> 59:06.448
Nice one, Brookie, good girl.

59:06.450 --> 59:08.350
Alright.

59:09.619 --> 59:10.619
Alright, nice.

59:10.621 --> 59:12.586
Nice, I like it.
Lovely.

59:12.588 --> 59:14.958
Everyone take turns,
everyone on the boards.

59:18.028 --> 59:19.928
Nice, breath control, Mathis!

59:19.930 --> 59:21.329
- Easy money, right?
- Yeah, jackpot.

59:21.331 --> 59:23.099
Go Vegas.

59:27.470 --> 59:28.937
Alright, hand 'em over!

59:28.939 --> 59:30.238
The money of your lives.

59:30.240 --> 59:31.972
Here it is.

59:31.974 --> 59:32.974
What about you, champ?

59:32.976 --> 59:34.943
I guess I just don't have it.

59:34.945 --> 59:38.178
Well, regardless,
enjoy your afternoon all.

59:40.349 --> 59:41.952
Get out of here.

01:00:53.456 --> 01:00:54.990
Hey!

01:00:54.992 --> 01:00:56.127
Come here.

01:01:06.302 --> 01:01:08.204
Here, sit in my office.

01:01:14.343 --> 01:01:16.477
Saw you out there.

01:01:16.479 --> 01:01:19.213
Looked like you were having fun.

01:01:19.215 --> 01:01:20.448
Something like that.

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:24.619
Yeah, well, fun is overrated.

01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:28.323
Nothing good is ever easy.

01:01:28.325 --> 01:01:29.758
Take my job.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.695
They hand me a bunch of
pre-pubescent, knob-jockey seppos

01:01:33.697 --> 01:01:39.233
that I would literally rather drag my
clangy sac through infected glass.

01:01:39.235 --> 01:01:44.738
Than teach how to be men and women,
much less unleash these dingbats

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:49.309
in the billabong
to save some drowning sook.

01:01:49.311 --> 01:01:51.448
You started this
with the right boofhead.

01:02:13.803 --> 01:02:16.236
Yeah.

01:02:16.238 --> 01:02:21.675
I think that is more fitting!

01:02:21.677 --> 01:02:23.278
Dinky-di!

01:02:30.253 --> 01:02:31.553
Alright, mate.

01:02:56.847 --> 01:03:00.314
You got it bad, man.

01:03:01.852 --> 01:03:05.285
How do you get the girl, Mathis?

01:03:05.287 --> 01:03:07.187
You don't, dude.

01:03:07.189 --> 01:03:08.655
But you learn.

01:03:08.657 --> 01:03:11.425
Find a better one later.

01:03:11.427 --> 01:03:15.398
You know I if the boat doesn't
come to shore, swim to it.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.667
Hey, if you're ever in the mood though,
I'll have to whoop to your ass.

01:03:20.669 --> 01:03:22.338
Loyalty, you know, right?

01:03:28.445 --> 01:03:29.313
Shit!

01:03:30.347 --> 01:03:34.084
Hey, kid's gotta learn
to fight his own battles.

01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:40.588
Ow!

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:43.591
Come on, Woods.

01:03:43.593 --> 01:03:45.463
Fight back.

01:04:13.923 --> 01:04:18.492
<i>It may have been wrong to take
Mathis' advice, but I did.</i>

01:04:18.494 --> 01:04:21.662
<i>And I never saw Woods on the
beach again.</i>

01:04:21.664 --> 01:04:25.233
<i>Yeah, I would see him around
school and in the neighborhood,</i>

01:04:25.235 --> 01:04:29.537
<i>but I never imagined that our
saying "bros as we grows"</i>

01:04:29.539 --> 01:04:33.276
<i>would end up meaning
"as we grow apart".</i>

01:05:03.439 --> 01:05:04.842
What are you looking for?

01:05:08.811 --> 01:05:10.445
Oh.

01:05:10.447 --> 01:05:12.847
I guess I was just...

01:05:12.849 --> 01:05:14.582
I don't know, I thought there
was something out here,

01:05:14.584 --> 01:05:18.285
I guess it was just in my head.

01:05:18.287 --> 01:05:20.724
Oh yeah, everything is in our
heads.

01:05:25.327 --> 01:05:26.526
Okay, I see.

01:05:26.528 --> 01:05:27.528
Real neat.

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:31.399
What do you see?
Tell me.

01:05:31.401 --> 01:05:33.934
You're tryin' to make me think
I imagined all that.

01:05:33.936 --> 01:05:35.336
Tryin' to cover your tracks,
huh?

01:05:35.338 --> 01:05:38.338
I stopped covering my tracks
years ago.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.943
It's okay to leave footprints,
okay?

01:05:41.945 --> 01:05:43.477
I'm kinda pissed, dude.

01:05:43.479 --> 01:05:47.282
Everybody in this town has been running
my ass off for their own amusement.

01:05:47.284 --> 01:05:48.582
Running?

01:05:48.584 --> 01:05:49.483
Why do you run?

01:05:49.485 --> 01:05:51.718
You know, first of all,
to save my life.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.488
Remember that skateboard you
gave me?

01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.990
- Doorway to the universe or whatever.
- Yeah.

01:05:55.992 --> 01:06:00.327
Yeah, you could have told me it belonged
to some giant, angry Hawaiian dudes.

01:06:00.329 --> 01:06:01.762
You tryin' to get me murdered?

01:06:01.764 --> 01:06:04.365
I have some news.

01:06:04.367 --> 01:06:06.033
Okay!

01:06:06.035 --> 01:06:09.637
I have defeated the dark.

01:06:09.639 --> 01:06:13.508
I think we all can.

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:14.776
Does the dark have my bike?

01:06:14.778 --> 01:06:18.845
The dark has a hold of
everything if you let it.

01:06:18.847 --> 01:06:24.318
But you can decide whether the
darkness has a hold on you or not.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.919
You with me?

01:06:25.921 --> 01:06:30.325
It's so easy that it's
difficult.

01:06:30.327 --> 01:06:36.997
But when you find the key,
it's very easy.

01:06:36.999 --> 01:06:38.899
Yeah, I guess it doesn't really
matter anyway.

01:06:38.901 --> 01:06:40.600
It's just a bike.

01:06:40.602 --> 01:06:42.937
I'm kind of in deeper now
anyways.

01:06:42.939 --> 01:06:44.939
That's it.

01:06:44.941 --> 01:06:46.506
You got it.

01:06:46.508 --> 01:06:48.675
What?

01:06:48.677 --> 01:06:52.946
You got what it takes and you
always did.

01:06:55.517 --> 01:06:59.921
Yeah, California knocks you down,
but you bounce right back up.

01:06:59.923 --> 01:07:01.823
Right?

01:07:01.825 --> 01:07:03.557
It's a beautiful lady.

01:07:03.559 --> 01:07:07.394
Tough perhaps,
but she's full of love.

01:07:07.396 --> 01:07:12.066
If you can take it in.

01:07:12.068 --> 01:07:14.369
Let the light in.

01:07:14.371 --> 01:07:17.437
Minnesota.

01:07:17.439 --> 01:07:19.073
Great.

01:07:19.075 --> 01:07:25.412
So I came all the way out here for you
to tell me I already have what I needed.

01:07:25.414 --> 01:07:28.548
No, you came here for this.

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:29.686
The magic.

01:07:35.457 --> 01:07:37.794
Look at my finger.

01:07:50.006 --> 01:07:51.675
Hey!

01:07:53.943 --> 01:07:55.876
- What are you doing?
- Just lookin' for some friends.

01:07:55.878 --> 01:07:57.077
What are you doing?

01:07:57.079 --> 01:08:00.981
Uh, I don't know.

01:08:00.983 --> 01:08:03.084
What are you doing, tonight?

01:08:03.086 --> 01:08:05.019
- T... tonight?
- Yeah.

01:08:05.021 --> 01:08:08.990
I don't know.
Just uh... nothin' actually.

01:08:08.992 --> 01:08:13.461
Okay, well,
why don't you come with me?

01:08:21.904 --> 01:08:24.837
- Hey mate, you found your bike?
- Uh, no.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.475
I just kinda gave up.

01:08:28.478 --> 01:08:29.910
What's the problem, man?

01:08:29.912 --> 01:08:30.912
I don't need it.

01:08:30.913 --> 01:08:32.479
You guys ready?

01:08:32.482 --> 01:08:33.479
Oh yeah.

01:08:33.482 --> 01:08:34.481
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:08:34.483 --> 01:08:36.050
Uh, what?
Ready for what?

01:08:36.051 --> 01:08:38.852
Spin the bottle.

01:08:38.854 --> 01:08:42.154
One of us shouts
"seven minutes in heaven"...

01:08:43.058 --> 01:08:47.060
Well, you have to
go with that person.

01:08:47.062 --> 01:08:49.062
Go... go where?

01:08:49.064 --> 01:08:50.930
Bathroom.

01:08:50.933 --> 01:08:52.064
What do you do in the bathroom?

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:57.171
Whatever your
imagination can handle.

01:08:57.173 --> 01:08:58.537
I can imagine a lot.

01:08:59.808 --> 01:09:02.944
Shut up, man!

01:09:07.216 --> 01:09:10.818
Alright, let's get this party
started.

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:15.221
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

01:09:15.224 --> 01:09:16.794
You start.

01:09:19.795 --> 01:09:21.895
Oh!

01:09:28.937 --> 01:09:30.703
It's your turn, Minnesota.

01:09:39.648 --> 01:09:41.983
Alright, big boy.

01:09:41.984 --> 01:09:46.185
Let's go.

01:09:46.188 --> 01:09:50.957
I'm gonna kiss you, man.
Is that alright?

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.059
Spin again, dude.

01:09:58.268 --> 01:10:00.534
Seven minutes in heaven.

01:10:00.536 --> 01:10:01.838
Oh!

01:10:10.146 --> 01:10:11.611
Oh, you guys leaving so early.

01:10:11.613 --> 01:10:13.013
You just got here!

01:10:14.616 --> 01:10:17.685
Hey, Minnesota.

01:10:34.903 --> 01:10:35.903
Where are we going?

01:10:35.905 --> 01:10:37.174
We're almost there.

01:10:56.192 --> 01:10:59.193
Well?

01:10:59.195 --> 01:11:02.930
Um, what are we gonna do?

01:11:02.932 --> 01:11:05.132
What do you wanna do?

01:11:05.134 --> 01:11:07.334
Everything.

01:11:07.336 --> 01:11:08.302
I don't know.

01:11:10.673 --> 01:11:15.008
You uh, ever make out with
anyone?

01:11:15.010 --> 01:11:16.810
I don't know.

01:11:16.812 --> 01:11:18.178
I guess.

01:11:19.682 --> 01:11:23.950
Let me steer.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:48.376
It's nice, just a
little less spit.

01:12:10.066 --> 01:12:12.365
You're so cute.

01:12:12.367 --> 01:12:15.136
Not bad for your first time.

01:13:00.383 --> 01:13:01.449
Well, who's next?

01:13:01.451 --> 01:13:03.184
Ah, the two shark biscuits!

01:13:03.186 --> 01:13:04.720
Now get it.

01:13:10.125 --> 01:13:11.191
Rescue 3, rescue 3.

01:13:11.193 --> 01:13:12.025
Oh!

01:13:12.027 --> 01:13:14.794
This is HQ.

01:13:14.796 --> 01:13:16.329
Copy, Tony.

01:13:16.331 --> 01:13:17.898
Tony, just got a call

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:20.434
about a floating piece of debris
outside the cove.

01:13:20.436 --> 01:13:21.435
What's you're 20?

01:13:24.072 --> 01:13:26.207
That's right,
we're about five minutes out.

01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:27.807
Swing
over there and check it out.

01:13:27.809 --> 01:13:29.877
Copy that. On the move.

01:13:29.879 --> 01:13:33.279
Lisa, get those kids back to
shore!

01:13:33.281 --> 01:13:38.017
Alright, Brooke, Minnesota,
ready to go work?

01:13:38.019 --> 01:13:39.285
Back in the boat.

01:14:35.344 --> 01:14:37.410
<i>There he was.</i>

01:14:37.412 --> 01:14:40.116
<i>It was the missing
boy from the flyers.</i>

01:14:48.357 --> 01:14:51.525
<i>Somehow the picture
had made him look old,</i>

01:14:51.527 --> 01:14:55.098
<i>but in reality maybe
he was in college.</i>

01:14:57.567 --> 01:14:59.302
Be careful with him!

01:15:15.317 --> 01:15:17.450
South Bay at 1, South Bay at 2.

01:15:20.388 --> 01:15:22.155
And assist vessel 3, over.

01:15:22.157 --> 01:15:23.390
Every day...

01:15:26.262 --> 01:15:29.329
I miss him every day.

01:15:32.268 --> 01:15:34.068
It's okay.

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:35.535
I got you.

01:15:35.537 --> 01:15:36.904
Okay.

01:15:46.214 --> 01:15:48.215
Let's get you kids back to
shore, eh?

01:16:18.513 --> 01:16:21.649
<i>For as much joy as the ocean
gave me that summer,</i>

01:16:21.651 --> 01:16:25.121
<i>the discovery of the body proved
it could be cruel as well.</i>

01:16:28.124 --> 01:16:31.391
<i>But it wasn't the body that
changed me.</i>

01:16:31.393 --> 01:16:34.328
<i>Nor Brooke's embrace.</i>

01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:37.096
<i>Her reliving
her brother's long-ago death?</i>

01:16:37.098 --> 01:16:39.400
<i>No.</i>

01:16:39.402 --> 01:16:42.002
<i>It was watching Tony deal
with the situation</i>

01:16:42.004 --> 01:16:45.405
<i>and reveal his true colors.</i>

01:16:45.407 --> 01:16:48.475
<i>As scared as I was of his
attention that summer,</i>

01:16:48.477 --> 01:16:51.278
<i>I was lucky to have had it.</i>

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.015
<i>He made us strong,
so that he could trust us.</i>

01:16:55.017 --> 01:17:00.956
<i>For the first time, I understood the
true meaning of the word "lifeguard".</i>

01:18:09.191 --> 01:18:13.459
Well, my little brown sea
pickles, you made it!

01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:15.428
Bonzer.

01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:17.230
Look around you.

01:18:17.232 --> 01:18:19.733
Lot of hard yakka.

01:18:19.735 --> 01:18:22.235
Some of you surprised me.

01:18:22.237 --> 01:18:25.372
Some of you didn't have to.

01:18:25.374 --> 01:18:29.642
But overall, I have to say that
I am...

01:18:31.347 --> 01:18:36.350
Proud of all of you complete
knob-ends.

01:18:36.352 --> 01:18:41.654
But as in the job of life-guarding,
there can be no bludgers.

01:18:41.656 --> 01:18:45.324
And today is no exception!

01:18:45.326 --> 01:18:46.526
Sand work.

01:18:47.796 --> 01:18:50.064
Give me a lap around
the south tower.

01:18:53.134 --> 01:18:54.603
Have a go, you mutts!

01:19:07.782 --> 01:19:08.815
Yeah.

01:19:14.656 --> 01:19:15.689
No way.

01:19:15.691 --> 01:19:17.291
Where the hell did you get
these?

01:19:17.293 --> 01:19:18.691
Oh, sick!

01:19:22.697 --> 01:19:24.163
Yeah!

01:19:24.165 --> 01:19:26.400
- Clean stroke.
- Nice!

01:19:26.402 --> 01:19:28.534
- I'd like to propose a toast.
- Yes.

01:19:28.536 --> 01:19:30.104
To Minnesota for
making it this far.

01:19:30.106 --> 01:19:31.672
Yeah.

01:19:36.312 --> 01:19:38.444
Dude, these are warm.

01:19:38.446 --> 01:19:39.812
This is the shit.

01:19:39.814 --> 01:19:41.181
Let me feel.

01:19:41.183 --> 01:19:42.649
Oh, you're right, it's hot to
the touch.

01:19:42.651 --> 01:19:44.184
Didn't those old guys
have any ice?

01:19:44.186 --> 01:19:45.385
We didn't exactly chat.

01:19:45.387 --> 01:19:47.287
Just drink it quick.

01:19:47.289 --> 01:19:48.821
I'll drink it.

01:19:52.428 --> 01:19:54.261
Oh!

01:20:37.606 --> 01:20:38.605
Hey.

01:20:38.607 --> 01:20:39.476
Hey.

01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:43.209
Looks awesome, huh?

01:20:43.211 --> 01:20:45.645
Yeah.

01:20:45.647 --> 01:20:47.446
You're gonna talk
to me out there?

01:20:47.448 --> 01:20:50.851
Probably not.

01:20:50.853 --> 01:20:53.787
Why?
'Cause I'm not a local?

01:20:53.789 --> 01:20:55.922
Something like that.

01:21:13.541 --> 01:21:17.810
<i>I was wrong to think I had to
say something to get the girl.</i>

01:21:17.812 --> 01:21:20.682
<i>And at that age,
what is getting the girl?</i>

01:21:23.686 --> 01:21:26.421
<i>What I was really looking for
was a friend.</i>

01:21:27.423 --> 01:21:31.257
<i>I didn't have to say anything,
I just had to be there</i>

01:21:31.259 --> 01:21:34.828
<i>to put in the time
and to continue to try.</i>

01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:37.567
<i>And if it was meant to be,
she'd notice me.</i>

01:24:56.207 --> 01:25:01.207
