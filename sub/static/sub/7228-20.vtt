why you sank.

sound good, too,

10:16.449 --> 10:19.910
With those tail fins,
you'll swim like a fish.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.996
Or a mermaid.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.748
You're doing great,
Melinda.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.292
Do you really think so?

10:26.375 --> 10:28.002
You bet.
Totally!

10:31.339 --> 10:33.466
You're
an amazing swimmer!

10:33.549 --> 10:34.842
Way to go!

10:35.468 --> 10:37.303
Woo-hoo! Yay!

10:37.386 --> 10:39.722
Melinda,
she's learning now!

10:44.560 --> 10:46.854
Did you see me?
I did it!

10:46.937 --> 10:48.856
I learned to swim!

10:49.357 --> 10:50.733
Oh, yay, Melinda.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.277
Can I try to jump
through the hoop now?

10:53.361 --> 10:55.821
Please,
oh, please say yes.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.948
Yes.
Surfer Girl?

11:01.118 --> 11:05.331
[Doc] Three, two, one, go!

11:10.044 --> 11:13.547
Oh, no. Did Melinda sink
to the bottom again?

11:18.219 --> 11:20.304
[cheering]

11:22.598 --> 11:23.849
<span style="style.default_1">♪ I did it ♪</span>

11:23.933 --> 11:25.976
You were great!

11:26.060 --> 11:27.728

11:27.812 --> 11:30.189
You were perfect!

11:30.272 --> 11:32.441
[cheering]

11:32.525 --> 11:34.860
Oh, now that I know
how to swim,

11:34.944 --> 11:37.029
I feel so much better.

for helping me
learn how to swim.

12:01.137 --> 12:05.141
I love helping toys,
and now that you've
learned to swim,

12:05.224 --> 12:08.769
I think you're gonna make
a big splash. [laughs]

12:08.853 --> 12:10.229
Whoo-hoo!

12:10.312 --> 12:12.481
[laughter]

12:17.361 --> 12:20.823
Whoever drops the sparkly ball
with sparkles is out.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.451
[giggle]
Bounce it higher!

12:24.368 --> 12:27.705

the dragon does it!

12:28.330 --> 12:31.375
Oh! I got this!

12:32.668 --> 12:33.836
[ringing]

12:33.919 --> 12:35.838
Yikes! There's something
in there, Doc.

12:35.921 --> 12:39.258
It must be really big,
'cause it sure is loud.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.511
Stuffy, there's nothing
in this toy box
except some old toys.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.972
[phone] <span style="style.default_1">Hello.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Want to come out</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and play?</span>

12:46.849 --> 12:49.477
Oh, I know what you heard.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.562
My toy cell phone.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.814
I loved playing with this
when I was little.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.108
You must have stepped
on a button or something.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.277
Check this out.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.237
<span style="style.default_1">I like talking to you.</span>

13:00.321 --> 13:02.364
<span style="style.default_1">Leave a message</span>
<span style="style.default_1">after the beep.</span>

13:02.448 --> 13:06.327
Hey! You got this phone
on the same birthday
you got me.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.078
Wasn't his name Louie?

13:08.537 --> 13:10.080
Wow. Good memory.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.208
Let's see if Louie
remembers, too.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.713
<span style="style.default_1">Wow! Hi, Doc.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Hi, Lambie!</span>

13:17.796 --> 13:19.298
Hi, Louie.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.801
Yeah, it's good
to see you again.

13:22.885 --> 13:26.514
<span style="style.default_1">Doc, you're so big!</span>
[laughs]

13:26.597 --> 13:28.933
<span style="style.default_1">Way bigger than</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the last time I saw you!</span>

13:29.016 --> 13:31.268
I know. I grew up.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.021
It's been
a really long time
since I played with you.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.191
<span style="style.default_1">Yeah. Remember</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when you pretended to call</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the ice cream truck?</span>

13:37.274 --> 13:39.193
I'll have
a quadruple-duple scoop

13:39.276 --> 13:42.363
of razzle berry ripple,
please. [laughs]

13:42.446 --> 13:44.031
Mmm.
Sounds good to me.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.450
Oh, Stuffy, this is Louie.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.452
Pleased to meet you,
Louie.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.956
Oh. Yeah. No arms.
[chuckles]

13:52.039 --> 13:53.332
I'm Stuffy.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.751
Stuffy the Brave Dragon.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.837
<span style="style.default_1">Whoa! I love dragons!</span>

13:58.921 --> 13:59.964
[knock on door]

14:00.047 --> 14:01.966
[gasps] Toys, go stuffed.
[door opens]

14:02.049 --> 14:03.425
Hmm.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.010
Hey, Mom.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.055
That's strange.
I could have sworn

14:08.138 --> 14:09.890
I heard another voice
in here.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.518
Oh, that was my phone.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.144
Uh, remember this?

14:14.228 --> 14:15.479
[ring]
<span style="style.default_1">Hello.</span>

14:15.563 --> 14:17.356
Oh.
<span style="style.default_1">Want to come out and play?</span>

14:17.439 --> 14:21.485
Oh, yeah.
Dad and I got this for you
when you were really little,

14:21.569 --> 14:24.321
so you wouldn't keep playing
with my real phone.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.865
[giggles]

14:28.075 --> 14:30.035
Mmm. Night, sweets.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.453
Night, Mom.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.038
[click]

14:33.497 --> 14:34.999
Sleep tight, you guys.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.585
Night night.
Sweet dreams.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.753
<span style="style.default_1">Good night!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">See you tomorrow!</span>

14:41.213 --> 14:43.465
[laughs]
He's so loud.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.302
I think he's just excited
to see us.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.012
Night, Louie.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.349
[snoring]

14:54.894 --> 14:56.395
[sighs]
Oh...

14:57.438 --> 14:59.648
[snoring, sighing]

15:01.901 --> 15:03.819
[beeping]

15:03.903 --> 15:05.404
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, are you guys awake?</span>

15:05.487 --> 15:07.031
Huh?
Whaah!

15:07.114 --> 15:09.700
[groans] We are now.

15:09.783 --> 15:13.537
Well, it looks like
a beautiful day.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.498
A beautiful day
means it's time to play.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.418
Want to come play
in the clinic with us, Louie?

15:19.501 --> 15:21.962
<span style="style.default_1">No way! I really do!</span>

15:22.046 --> 15:23.380
All right!

15:25.424 --> 15:26.634
Morning, sweets.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.719
Hey, Mom.
Going out to play.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.095
Okay, kiddo.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.102
The Doc is in.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.649
Hi, guys!
Morning to ya, Doc.

15:41.732 --> 15:42.691
Morning!

15:43.233 --> 15:44.860
<span style="style.default_1">Hi! I'm Louie!</span>

15:44.944 --> 15:46.862
Ooh!
Oh, my.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.865
Why, you're more excited
than a puppy on a play date.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.952
I'll say,
and loud, too.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.287
Do you think I could
get some ear plugs?

15:55.371 --> 15:56.664
Sorry, Chilly.

15:56.747 --> 16:00.042
Snowmen don't really have ears
to put the ear plugs in.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.293
Who knew?

16:01.377 --> 16:02.378
[laughs]

16:02.461 --> 16:04.672
Oh, you did. You knew.
Thanks, Doc.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.548
What's the matter, sugar?

16:06.632 --> 16:09.051
Antenna got you down?
Did you bump a button?

16:09.134 --> 16:10.761
Oh, Louie's not
a patient, Hallie.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.471
We just came to play.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.473
Well, dancing doodle bugs.

16:14.556 --> 16:19.144
No patients today
means Hallie can hang up
the clipboard and play.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.648
[laughs] Oh,
I do love a good rhyme.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.026
[laughs] Let's show
Louie how we do it.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.570
Who's up for a little
Hide and Go Seek?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.614
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, me, me!</span>

16:30.698 --> 16:33.158
<span style="style.default_1">That's my favorite game!</span>

16:33.242 --> 16:35.452
You sure get loud
when you're excited, Louie.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.248
Mind if I turn
your volume down
before we start?

16:39.331 --> 16:40.666
<span style="style.default_1">Okay.</span>

16:41.917 --> 16:43.419
[beeping]
That should do it.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.839
Okay, I'll count,
you guys hide.

16:47.339 --> 16:52.928
One, two, three,
four, five,

16:53.012 --> 16:57.850
six, seven, eight,
nine, ten!

16:57.933 --> 17:00.019
Ready or not, here I come!

17:00.102 --> 17:02.646
[Louie] <span style="style.default_1">She'll never</span>
<span style="style.default_1">find me in here!</span>

17:05.023 --> 17:05.858
Hey, Louie.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.487
<span style="style.default_1">Wow. You found me.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">How'd you do that?</span>

17:10.570 --> 17:12.114
It was pretty easy.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.366
I just followed
the sound of your voice.

17:14.782 --> 17:16.910
<span style="style.default_1">Uh-oh. Was I loud?</span>

17:16.993 --> 17:20.455
Yeah, way too loud
for hide and go seek.

17:20.830 --> 17:24.877
And it's weird because
I just turned your volume down,

17:24.960 --> 17:27.838
so you should be
talking quietly right now.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.758
<span style="style.default_1">But I'm not trying</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to talk loud.</span>

17:30.841 --> 17:32.551
<span style="style.default_1">I'm just excited.</span>

17:32.634 --> 17:34.928
<span style="style.default_1">I guess my voice</span>
<span style="style.default_1">just comes out like that</span>

17:35.012 --> 17:36.722
<span style="style.default_1">no matter what I do.</span>

17:36.805 --> 17:38.640
Or maybe you're broken.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.102
<span style="style.default_1">Broken?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, that sounds bad!</span>

17:43.645 --> 17:45.147
No, it's not bad.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.066
There's not much
I can't fix.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.567
So don't worry.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.110
I'm gonna figure it
all out.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.029
[Hallie] I heard that
loud and clear.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.532
Sounds like time for the doctor
for broken toys to do her thing.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.575

<span style="style.default_1">Aah!</span>

18:30.484 --> 18:32.444
I have a diagnosis.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.989
You have a case
of superloud-itis.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.492
<span style="style.default_1">Superloud-itis?</span>

18:38.575 --> 18:40.119
Aaah!

18:40.202 --> 18:42.204
Tell it to <span style="style.default_1">The Big Book</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of Boo-boos.</span>

18:43.247 --> 18:44.957
Yeah, but not too loud.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.126
My ears can't take it.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.545
Now that I know
what you have,

18:49.628 --> 18:51.839
I have to figure out
why you have it.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.216
Maybe something's wrong
with your volume button.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.428
Hmm.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.639
Say something, Louie.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.183
<span style="style.default_1">What should I say?</span>

19:03.267 --> 19:05.102
Ah, that's a relief.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.104
My ears were
starting to sweat.

19:07.563 --> 19:11.066
Hmm. Everything
seems to be working.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.777
<span style="style.default_1">Yay! I'm excited!</span>

19:13.861 --> 19:16.280
<span style="style.default_1">So, can we play</span>
<span style="style.default_1">another game now?</span>

19:16.363 --> 19:19.032
Doc, Louie's
not quite working.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.659
He's still super loud.

19:20.742 --> 19:23.162
You're right. Hmm.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.498
Sometimes we need
to observe our patients

19:26.582 --> 19:28.500
to figure out
what's wrong with them.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.253
We should totally
observe our patient.

19:32.838 --> 19:36.049
It won't hurt the little guy
too much, will it?

19:36.133 --> 19:37.676
No, Stuffy.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.512
Observing Louie
means we watch him

19:40.596 --> 19:42.264
to see why
he can't talk quietly.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.433
I'd like to watch Louie
play a game.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.851
What kind of a game?

19:45.934 --> 19:48.937
We could do a loud game
or a quiet game.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.772
Uh, I vote for quiet.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.942
Let's play a quiet game,
like Telephone.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.527
<span style="style.default_1">I'll be good at that!</span>

19:55.611 --> 19:58.739
Lambie, can you explain
to Louie how to play

19:58.822 --> 19:59.990
while I take notes?

20:00.949 --> 20:02.910
Someone whispers something
to someone else,

20:02.993 --> 20:05.162
and then they whisper it
to the next player

20:05.245 --> 20:07.664
and around the circle
until we get to the end.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.667
Yep. Then the end person
says what they heard,

20:10.751 --> 20:13.378
and we see
if it's the same thing
we started with.

20:13.462 --> 20:17.382
<span style="style.default_1">Woo hoo! I'm super excited</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to play Telephone!</span>

20:17.758 --> 20:22.137
Super excited
and super loud.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.058
Remember, Louie,
even if you're excited,

20:26.141 --> 20:27.309
try to whisper.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.687
That's when you talk
really super soft,
like this.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.022
I'll start.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.025
[softly]
Louie needs a cuddle.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.320
Oh, okay.
Hallie, Louie needs a...

20:39.404 --> 20:41.573
Louie...
[whispering]

20:43.367 --> 20:45.118
<span style="style.default_1">Harry's in a puddle!</span>
Oh!

20:45.202 --> 20:48.455
Louie, you're supposed
to... [softly] whisper.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.416
If that was a whisper,
I'm a purple hippo.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.586
Um, Hallie,
you are a purple hippo.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.630
Oh, you know
what I mean.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.799
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't mean</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to ruin the game.</span>

20:58.882 --> 21:01.551
<span style="style.default_1">It's just</span>
<span style="style.default_1">it's really hard to whisper</span>

21:01.635 --> 21:04.429
<span style="style.default_1">when I'm just super excited!</span>

21:04.513 --> 21:07.683
Louie, I think I know why
you have loud-itis.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.393
Once she knows
what's broken,

21:09.476 --> 21:10.978
she can fix it right up.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.104
That's the thing.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.439
I don't think
anything's broken.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.275
You're working
just fine.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.318
But when
you're excited,

21:18.402 --> 21:20.904
you have a hard time
remembering
to be quiet.

21:20.988 --> 21:24.491
When I was little,
I had to learn how
to use my indoor voice,

21:24.992 --> 21:28.745
like in the library
or when Donny
was taking a nap.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.915
You just need
a little practice
to figure it out.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.002

<span style="style.default_1">♪ Sing a softer song ♪</span>

22:20.672 --> 22:22.424
So do you get it now?

22:22.507 --> 22:26.511
<span style="style.default_1">Yep! I need to remember</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when to use my outdoor voice</span>

22:26.595 --> 22:28.597
<span style="style.default_1">and when to use</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my indoor voice!</span>

22:29.181 --> 22:31.516
You know we're indoors,
right?

22:31.892 --> 22:35.771
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, right!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So I should use</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my indoor voice.</span>

22:35.854 --> 22:37.230
There you go, Louie.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.232
That's how you talk
quietly.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.776
That's right, sugar.

22:41.109 --> 22:43.236
You save your shout
for when you're out.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.322
Now that Louie's not so loud,

22:45.405 --> 22:47.741
we can play
the telephone game again.

22:47.824 --> 22:49.409
Yeah!
Cool!

22:49.493 --> 22:52.370
Ready, everyone?
I'll start.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.206
[whispering]

22:58.668 --> 23:00.253
[whimpers]

23:00.712 --> 23:03.173
It's okay, Chilly.
Give him a chance.

23:05.675 --> 23:07.469
[whispering]

23:08.220 --> 23:09.971
You did it!
You whispered!

23:10.055 --> 23:11.723
[cheering]

23:11.807 --> 23:13.517
[whispering]

23:13.892 --> 23:16.520
Scary feet
in a bubble?

23:16.603 --> 23:18.271
[laughter]

23:18.355 --> 23:22.901
No! I said,
"Louie needs a cuddle."

23:23.568 --> 23:26.780
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, I love your cuddles!</span>

23:27.572 --> 23:29.282
[laughs]

23:33.036 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.166
<span style="style.default_1">Bronty has stinky</span>
<span style="style.default_1">brontosaurus breath.</span>

23:38.625 --> 23:41.586
<span style="style.default_1">What should you do</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if you have stinky breath?</span>

23:43.338 --> 23:44.965
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in the water?</span>

23:46.133 --> 23:47.300
[whinnying]

23:47.384 --> 23:49.052
<span style="style.default_1">Ride a plastic horse?</span>

23:51.388 --> 23:53.014
<span style="style.default_1">Or brush your teeth?</span>

23:53.515 --> 23:56.101
<span style="style.default_1">That's right.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Brush your teeth.</span>
