<i>Call me Martin.</i>

01:08.597 --> 01:10.899
<i>I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.</i>

01:11.200 --> 01:13.701
<i>Things a boy shouldn't see.</i>

01:14.002 --> 01:16.571
<i>But... I'm not a normal
boy anymore.</i>

01:16.872 --> 01:18.540
<i>And it ain't a normal world.</i>

01:18.841 --> 01:19.874
<i>Get used to it.</i>

01:20.175 --> 01:22.210
<i>That's what Mister tells me.</i>

01:22.511 --> 01:24.979
<i>We live by his rules or we die.</i>

01:25.280 --> 01:26.414
<i>Or worse.</i>

01:26.715 --> 01:29.105
<i>We die and we come back.</i>

01:32.721 --> 01:35.223
<i>But let's begin at the beginning.</i>

01:35.524 --> 01:38.359
<i>I was like any other kid,
I had a family.</i>

01:38.660 --> 01:39.727
<i>I went to school,</i>

01:40.028 --> 01:42.987
<i>I didn't believe in the boogey man.</i>

01:43.966 --> 01:46.527
<i>But then the world
woke up to a nightmare.</i>

01:54.510 --> 01:57.745
<i>...Stay in your homes
and not to travel by night.</i>

01:58.046 --> 01:59.380
<i>Route 22...</i>

01:59.681 --> 02:02.105
Maybe we should wait.

02:03.485 --> 02:06.353
We'll take the back roads,
you'll be safer there.

02:10.526 --> 02:12.460
No. Martin, come back!

02:12.761 --> 02:13.561
Hey!

02:13.862 --> 02:16.024
Martin!

02:17.432 --> 02:18.867
Cooper!

02:19.168 --> 02:21.228
Cooper!

02:22.037 --> 02:23.961
Cooper...

02:25.607 --> 02:27.633
Cooper...

02:28.610 --> 02:31.000
Cooper!

02:50.065 --> 02:52.694
Martin, run!

02:53.936 --> 02:56.030
Mom!

02:59.775 --> 03:01.276
Shh! Shh!

03:01.577 --> 03:03.017
You wanna live boy,
you listen to me.

03:03.245 --> 03:04.579
You scream,
I'll break your neck.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.046
They're dead!

03:05.347 --> 03:08.448
There's nothing to be done
about it but kill that thing.

03:09.251 --> 03:10.385
Can you shoot?

03:10.686 --> 03:13.486
You shoot me
I'll fuckin' kill you!

05:30.659 --> 05:33.584
I only got two hands, boy.
Do it!

06:20.409 --> 06:22.799
Save him...

06:40.061 --> 06:42.964
One day you'll learn
not to dream at all.

06:43.265 --> 06:45.564
Get your shit.

07:18.033 --> 07:20.662
Welcome to Stake Land, kid.

07:46.027 --> 07:48.763
<i>Months passed
in a blur of days and nights.</i>

07:49.064 --> 07:51.399
<i>We traveled east and west,
but always north.</i>

07:51.700 --> 07:53.467
<i>Away from death.</i>

07:53.768 --> 07:55.169
<i>We avoided the cities.</i>

07:55.470 --> 07:56.437
<i>Mister said they were the worst,</i>

07:56.738 --> 07:58.739
<i>hit the hardest in the beginning.</i>

07:59.040 --> 08:00.520
<i>As people flocked together
for safety,</i>

08:00.775 --> 08:02.176
<i>the plague marched through
their locked gates</i>

08:02.477 --> 08:04.579
<i>and they became death traps.</i>

08:04.880 --> 08:08.683
<i>When Washington fell, it was over
for America as we knew her.</i>

08:08.984 --> 08:12.153
<i>As government blew away,
our great leaders ran for it.</i>

08:12.454 --> 08:15.345
<i>And hope was abandoned.</i>

08:17.959 --> 08:19.694
<i>We were on our own now.</i>

08:19.995 --> 08:21.929
<i>Me and Mister.</i>

08:22.230 --> 08:24.398
<i>Traveling through a ruined land.</i>

08:24.699 --> 08:26.701
<i>Pockets of civilization survived.</i>

08:27.002 --> 08:28.869
<i>Towns locked down behind fences</i>

08:29.170 --> 08:31.772
<i>and guns holding the night away.</i>

08:32.073 --> 08:35.142
<i>Cults spread like wildfire

08:35.443 --> 08:39.676
<i>Waitin' for the messiah,

08:41.683 --> 08:44.210
<i>Death came instead.</i>

08:45.253 --> 08:47.484
<i>And it came with teeth.</i>

09:45.680 --> 09:47.114
Dumb fuck got himself trapped.

09:47.415 --> 09:49.714
Burnt up in the sun.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.924
Berserker.

09:57.225 --> 09:59.060
It's the oldest of the vamps.

09:59.361 --> 10:00.828
Can't stake 'em in the chest.

10:01.129 --> 10:02.430
Got a breast bone like iron.

10:02.731 --> 10:04.298
Gotta get 'em in the
base of the skull.

10:04.599 --> 10:05.900
Vamps...

10:06.201 --> 10:08.636
function from the reptile brain.

10:08.937 --> 10:13.364
It's like pullin' the
plug on a computer.

10:20.582 --> 10:22.850
<i>We were all orphans.</i>

10:23.151 --> 10:26.253

<i>He's a Mister.</i>

10:29.891 --> 10:32.759
<i>Maybe that's why
he keeps me with him.</i>

10:39.634 --> 10:40.534
What's that?

10:40.835 --> 10:42.436
Garlic oil.

10:42.737 --> 10:43.871
Does that really work?

10:44.172 --> 10:46.471
Don't hurt.

10:49.411 --> 10:50.411
One strike boy.

10:50.712 --> 10:53.136
Make it true.

11:52.807 --> 11:54.208
Where you boys comin' from?

11:54.509 --> 11:55.242
South.

11:55.543 --> 11:57.705
Get outta the car.

12:11.292 --> 12:13.784
Did you get any?

12:25.940 --> 12:28.671
They alright boys, let 'em roll.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.959
<i>Another town, another lockdown.</i>

12:45.260 --> 12:47.495
<i>People just tryin' to go on.</i>

12:47.796 --> 12:52.066
<i>Hopin' they'd wake up
and it would all be a bad dream.</i>

12:52.367 --> 12:54.401
<i>They could go back to their lives,</i>

12:54.702 --> 12:58.127
<i>families and careers.</i>

13:02.010 --> 13:05.037
He needs more fresh food.

13:06.181 --> 13:08.849
And some vitamins,
if you can find them.

13:09.150 --> 13:11.018
Where's his folks?

13:11.319 --> 13:13.686
Dead.

13:14.422 --> 13:16.657
He'd be better of here.

13:16.958 --> 13:19.426
With people.

13:19.727 --> 13:22.288
Other children.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.757
What do I owe you?

13:31.139 --> 13:32.506
I could use all of them.

13:32.807 --> 13:35.334
Good.

13:42.617 --> 13:44.084
Hey.

13:44.385 --> 13:46.186
Got any liquor in this town?

13:46.487 --> 13:47.655
Jake's.

13:47.956 --> 13:49.490
Homemade, mostly.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.025
We got some tap beer.

13:51.326 --> 13:55.024
Little sour,
but it won't kill ya.

13:56.030 --> 13:58.591
Boy needs a haircut.

14:20.521 --> 14:22.256
Sheriff said take whatever you need.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.822
It's on me.

14:26.227 --> 14:28.195
Have you been through Haggerstown?

14:28.496 --> 14:29.797
I had family there.

14:30.098 --> 14:32.666
Vamped out,
everything south of here.

14:32.967 --> 14:35.198
Rea--??

14:38.740 --> 14:41.608
He really kills 'em, huh?

14:42.443 --> 14:44.111
You gotta get 'em in the heart.

14:44.412 --> 14:47.371
Pierce the breast plate.

14:50.685 --> 14:53.143
You got any gum?

14:53.955 --> 14:55.456
Yes.

14:55.757 --> 14:57.919
Cool.

14:59.961 --> 15:02.328
Ah, just...

15:03.865 --> 15:06.200
So who are you?

15:06.501 --> 15:07.935
His helper.

15:08.236 --> 15:10.156
Where are you, Uhh... where are
you guys headin'?

15:10.171 --> 15:10.871
North.

15:11.105 --> 15:12.740
Uh, Mister says less population,
less bloodsuckers.

15:13.041 --> 15:13.440
Wait, wait, wait...

15:13.741 --> 15:16.233
Not New Eden right?

15:17.278 --> 15:19.513
We had a fella,
he came through here.

15:19.814 --> 15:23.550
He said there's nothing there,
there's no food at all.

15:23.851 --> 15:26.787
He said it's not the Vamps
ya need to worry about...

15:27.088 --> 15:28.422
it's the cannibals.

15:28.723 --> 15:30.988
Thanks.

15:39.901 --> 15:43.237
<i>Sometimes I think I could
stay in a place like this.</i>

15:43.538 --> 15:45.839
<i>Make friends,
live in the daylight.</i>

15:46.140 --> 15:47.241
<i>Just be a kid.</i>

15:47.542 --> 15:51.612
<i>But the truth is
I don't feel safe around people.</i>

15:51.913 --> 15:54.948
<i>They can think what they want
but New Eden was real.</i>

15:55.249 --> 15:58.318
<i>It was the answer to all of this
and we were gonna find it.</i>

15:58.619 --> 16:01.155
<i>Fight our way north,
make the open territories.</i>

16:01.456 --> 16:03.090
<i>Like Mister says.</i>

16:03.391 --> 16:05.526
<i>'Live free or die tryin'.</i>

16:05.827 --> 16:08.319
<i>Fuck the cannibals.</i>

16:17.905 --> 16:20.067
What's her name?

16:20.942 --> 16:23.207
I didn't ask.

16:35.023 --> 16:36.423
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

16:36.724 --> 16:39.059
<i>How can God let this happen?</i>

16:39.360 --> 16:42.194
<i>How can this be his love...</i>

17:18.098 --> 17:21.262
Oh... oh, God!

17:21.769 --> 17:25.661
Oh... oh, God!

17:27.642 --> 17:27.941
It's okay, lady.

17:28.242 --> 17:29.309
- No! No!
- Shh. Shh.

17:29.610 --> 17:30.577
It's okay!

17:30.878 --> 17:33.447
- No! No!
- It's alright!

17:33.748 --> 17:35.082
No!

17:35.383 --> 17:36.517
It's okay. It's okay.

17:36.818 --> 17:39.845
It's okay, it's okay.

18:02.210 --> 18:04.737
<i>Mister,</i>

18:05.246 --> 18:08.307
<i>where'd all that
hate come from?</i>

18:09.851 --> 18:12.378
<i>I never asked.</i>

18:19.393 --> 18:21.954
Those men that...

18:23.965 --> 18:26.400
They said they were Christians.

18:26.701 --> 18:28.836
We don't do history.

18:29.137 --> 18:31.971
Doesn't do anybody any good.

18:33.508 --> 18:35.966
Grab them traps, boy.

19:02.670 --> 19:05.128
Give me a finger.

19:57.625 --> 20:00.015
Time to go fishin'.

21:09.597 --> 21:11.759
Get the long pole.

21:14.168 --> 21:16.169
Sister Agatha.

21:16.470 --> 21:17.430
We thought she was dead.

21:17.705 --> 21:19.806
She is.

21:20.107 --> 21:20.987
What are you gonna do?

21:21.075 --> 21:23.636
I'm gonna kill that thing.

21:26.714 --> 21:27.414
Go with God.

21:27.615 --> 21:29.812
Lock the door.

21:36.957 --> 21:39.449
Newbie. Shouldn't be too hard.

21:49.270 --> 21:52.263
Too fat, I can't break the spine.

22:25.272 --> 22:28.108
You missed the heart ya,
dumb shit.

22:28.409 --> 22:30.799
Fuckin' vamps!

22:36.951 --> 22:38.840
Stop it!

23:34.208 --> 23:36.769
<i>Mister dug a grave.</i>

23:37.211 --> 23:40.409
<i>I think he felt bad
for the sister.</i>

23:42.516 --> 23:45.385
<i>He did pull the fangs out, but...</i>

23:45.686 --> 23:49.111
<i>he waited till she went
to pick the flowers.</i>

23:58.866 --> 24:02.064
How many of those things
have you killed?

24:02.803 --> 24:05.534
Not enough.

24:06.674 --> 24:08.808
And people?

24:09.109 --> 24:10.210
Those two men?

24:10.511 --> 24:14.107
In my book,
rapists got no place to live.

24:14.982 --> 24:16.016
It's not ours to judge.

24:16.317 --> 24:17.017
Then don't.

24:17.251 --> 24:18.652
Next lockdown, we drop you off.

24:18.953 --> 24:20.187
You go save some souls.

24:20.488 --> 24:22.556
And what about him?

24:22.857 --> 24:24.024
He's just a boy.

24:24.325 --> 24:25.225
Yeah.

24:25.526 --> 24:27.859
A live one.

24:52.853 --> 24:55.755
<i>But we never dropped her off.</i>

24:56.056 --> 24:58.651
<i>Where was she gonna go?</i>

25:03.697 --> 25:05.332
<i>Satan's soldiers

<i>Dead wrong.</i>

27:23.804 --> 27:27.540
My name is Jebedia Loven.

27:27.841 --> 27:30.076
And you killed two of my men.

27:30.377 --> 27:33.213
In cold blood.

27:33.514 --> 27:37.178
Staked one in the back.

27:38.519 --> 27:41.284
He was my son.

27:42.089 --> 27:44.324
My own boy.

27:44.625 --> 27:47.493
He was only sixteen.

27:56.070 --> 28:02.533
He cried for his mother for
three hours before he died.

28:03.177 --> 28:05.445
God rest his soul.

28:05.746 --> 28:08.614
Now you a fine lookin'
young buck.

28:09.983 --> 28:12.316
That's your father?

28:16.090 --> 28:18.958
My father's dead.

28:23.330 --> 28:25.754
Oh, don't you worry.

28:26.333 --> 28:29.098
We'll get you some religion.

28:30.637 --> 28:34.665
Bring you to God
and the right way.

28:39.179 --> 28:41.808
Good stock.

28:43.450 --> 28:45.351
You'll still serve.

28:45.652 --> 28:49.456
As for you, Mister.

28:49.757 --> 28:51.257
Oh, yeah.

28:51.558 --> 28:53.259
We know who you are.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.495
You kill them that come back,

28:55.796 --> 28:57.664
them that serve us,

28:57.965 --> 29:01.067
them that God brought down
to do his work.

29:01.368 --> 29:05.538
Leavin' us to purify
the blood of our fathers.

29:05.839 --> 29:07.340
And when that day comes,

29:07.641 --> 29:09.476
he will bring them back

29:09.777 --> 29:13.279
in peace and purity
will reign on the earth.

29:13.580 --> 29:14.981
Forever!

29:15.282 --> 29:15.982
Amen!

29:16.283 --> 29:18.775
Amen!

29:20.754 --> 29:24.987
What do you have to say
for yourself, sinner?

29:29.763 --> 29:33.325
Fuck you and fuck your God.

29:39.139 --> 29:40.740
Well...

29:41.041 --> 29:43.476
You can tell him that yourself.

29:43.777 --> 29:46.474
You're about to meet him.

30:16.977 --> 30:20.209
Welcome to the Valley of Them.

30:21.114 --> 30:24.676
Last stop for the weak of faith.

30:28.755 --> 30:31.145
Get him out here!

30:52.079 --> 30:53.413
Ah, look at them.

30:53.714 --> 30:55.982
The children of salvation.

30:56.283 --> 30:58.284
They come at my calling.

30:58.585 --> 31:01.350
They feed on the unfaithful.

31:04.091 --> 31:06.515
Shh.

31:08.295 --> 31:11.097
They say hell is cold,

31:11.398 --> 31:13.788
Hunter.

31:14.434 --> 31:17.393
Don't let that flame burn out.

31:47.701 --> 31:50.262
Get back, you bloodsuckers.

32:01.381 --> 32:03.016
How's your head?

32:03.317 --> 32:04.617
Mister.

32:04.918 --> 32:07.547
I'm sorry.

32:21.768 --> 32:24.370
Go down to the creek,
fill 'em up.

32:24.671 --> 32:27.198
Bring 'em back.

32:30.877 --> 32:32.835
Wait.

32:52.766 --> 32:55.065
Hey, boy.

32:56.336 --> 32:58.438
You can run if you want to.

32:58.739 --> 33:02.472
Ain't nothing out there
but sundown and them.

33:03.076 --> 33:05.807
You won't get far.

33:52.959 --> 33:55.261
<i>Mister taught me
how to read the stars.</i>

33:55.562 --> 33:56.996
<i>I could make my way
back to the car,</i>

33:57.297 --> 33:57.997
<i>get the weapons,</i>

33:58.298 --> 33:59.499
<i>find them robe-wearin' crazies</i>

33:59.800 --> 34:03.396
<i>and send them back to that God
they kept talking about.</i>

34:12.813 --> 34:14.013
<i>I had to keep movin'.</i>

34:14.313 --> 34:17.478
<i>Had to make the car
before night came.</i>

34:17.784 --> 34:19.252
<i>Mister was gone.</i>

34:19.553 --> 34:22.683
<i>And out here alone
I didn't stand a chance.</i>

35:33.226 --> 35:35.354
Shh.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.721
How many of them
things out there?

35:41.868 --> 35:43.236
One.

35:43.537 --> 35:45.104
But she's really pissed off.

35:45.405 --> 35:47.636
Make some noise.

35:48.208 --> 35:50.376
<i>Hey! In here!</i>

35:50.677 --> 35:51.777
<i>Hey!</i>

35:52.078 --> 35:54.280
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

35:54.581 --> 35:56.349
<i>Come and get me!</i>

35:56.650 --> 35:59.245
<i>Yeah, that's right, come on!</i>

35:59.586 --> 36:01.821
<i>I'm in here!</i>

36:02.122 --> 36:04.123
<i>Hey, I'm in here!</i>

36:04.424 --> 36:06.757
<i>Hey!</i>

36:10.030 --> 36:12.761
Come on, baby, come on, baby.

36:25.579 --> 36:27.647
Martin.

36:27.948 --> 36:31.009
I hate fuckin' vampires.

37:15.362 --> 37:17.730
<i>The Brotherhood needs
your eyes, followers.</i>

37:18.031 --> 37:20.132
<i>There are evildoers among us.</i>

37:20.433 --> 37:23.769
<i>This enemy of America
walks with faith.</i>

37:24.070 --> 37:27.606
<i>His name is Mister and he
is traveling with a young boy.</i>

37:27.907 --> 37:29.408
<i>They are armed and dangerous.</i>

37:29.709 --> 37:29.942
What happened?

37:30.243 --> 37:32.511
<i>They were last seen heading
north to Lafayetteville.</i>

37:32.812 --> 37:36.349
<i>If spotted,
dispatch of them immediately.</i>

37:36.650 --> 37:40.280
<i>These actions will not
go unrewarded.</i>

37:59.272 --> 38:01.273
We're gonna leave in the morning.

38:01.574 --> 38:02.308
We'll have to take a back road.

38:02.609 --> 38:05.477
Brotherhood got the
rest locked down.

38:06.379 --> 38:08.940
Let it go, boy.

38:18.825 --> 38:19.759
Get over there.

38:20.060 --> 38:21.994
You're gonna be crispy
in the mornin'.

38:22.295 --> 38:22.995
Come on, Willy!

38:23.296 --> 38:25.663
Give him a hand!

38:47.020 --> 38:48.687
What have ya got for trade?

38:48.988 --> 38:50.256
Antibiotics.

38:50.557 --> 38:52.856
Some weed.

38:53.593 --> 38:55.858
And these.

39:01.868 --> 39:04.370
Goddamn.

39:04.671 --> 39:07.232
That's a big one.

39:10.710 --> 39:11.577
What about the boy?

39:11.878 --> 39:12.878
I ain't got no soda pop.

39:13.179 --> 39:15.603
Give him another glass.

39:18.184 --> 39:20.386
You fellas look like
you've seen some trouble.

39:20.687 --> 39:22.621
A little.

39:22.922 --> 39:23.622
Vamps?

39:23.790 --> 39:26.214
Holy rollers.

39:28.294 --> 39:30.763
Yeah, well, we don't tolerate
religion or politics in here.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.531
Where's the next lockdown?

39:32.832 --> 39:34.033
Just over the mountains.

39:34.334 --> 39:35.734
Past Lafayette Valley.

39:36.035 --> 39:36.936
But that's Brotherhood territory.

39:37.237 --> 39:39.968
They don't take too kindly
to strangers.

39:42.342 --> 39:46.011
<i>...I'll shiver the whole night through</i>

39:46.312 --> 39:49.949
<i>Her husband,</i>
<i>was a hardworking man</i>

39:50.250 --> 39:53.486
<i>Just about a mile from here</i>

39:53.787 --> 39:54.487
Thanks.

39:54.754 --> 39:57.256
Been talk there was a hunter about.

39:57.557 --> 39:59.492
Thought you was all dead by now.

39:59.793 --> 40:01.853
Not yet.

40:02.662 --> 40:06.398
<i>...My girl, my girl, don't lie to me</i>

40:06.699 --> 40:10.536
<i>Tell me where</i>
<i>did you sleep last night.</i>

40:10.837 --> 40:14.640
<i>In the pines, in the pines,</i>
<i>where the sun never shines,</i>

40:14.941 --> 40:21.438
<i>I'd shiver the whole night through.</i>

40:23.249 --> 40:25.776
Thank you.

40:27.787 --> 40:29.255
We got one more for ya.

40:29.556 --> 40:31.787
Ready, boys?

41:05.458 --> 41:12.627
<i>Maria please don't leave</i>
<i>me now I need ya</i>

41:13.466 --> 41:15.301
<i>I'm a wanted</i>

41:15.602 --> 41:20.563
<i>There's nowhere I can go</i>

41:22.509 --> 41:24.376
<i>My up's turned down</i>

41:24.677 --> 41:29.206
<i>My luck's spun round and left me</i>

41:30.517 --> 41:33.078
<i>No I didn't see it...</i>

42:18.932 --> 42:21.367
<i>Her name was Belle.</i>

42:21.668 --> 42:24.103
<i>Her story was no different
from anyone else's.</i>

42:24.404 --> 42:25.104
<i>Home gone.</i>

42:25.371 --> 42:26.839
<i>Family gone.</i>

42:27.140 --> 42:29.775
<i>Oh, and she was pregnant.</i>

42:30.076 --> 42:32.845
<i>But I guess life goes on.</i>

42:33.146 --> 42:36.514
<i>She wanted to get to New Eden
before the baby came.</i>

46:48.768 --> 46:50.566
Hi.

46:53.973 --> 46:56.431
Scamp! In the attic!

47:48.594 --> 47:49.928
Do it.

47:50.229 --> 47:52.528
Stake the bitch.

47:55.935 --> 47:56.234
Stake the bitch!

47:56.535 --> 47:58.103
I let her go and
she'll eat your ass!

47:58.404 --> 47:59.671
<i>A Scamp.</i>

47:59.972 --> 48:02.841
<i>That's what Mister
called the kid vamps.</i>

48:03.142 --> 48:05.600
<i>She was just a kid.</i>

48:06.045 --> 48:10.881
<i>And if not for Mister,
I might have become like that.</i>

48:34.874 --> 48:37.242
Out of the fuckin' car!

48:37.543 --> 48:40.035
Out of the fuckin' car!

48:42.581 --> 48:44.914
Get your hands on your head.

49:31.597 --> 49:34.294
That's a nice shot, kid.

49:49.749 --> 49:50.849
Fuck.

49:51.150 --> 49:53.347
Hey, hey.

49:54.453 --> 49:56.388
What the hell
happened to you, man?

49:56.689 --> 49:58.790
Fuckin' Brotherhood
dumped me out of a truck.

49:59.091 --> 50:00.525
For vamp bait.

50:00.826 --> 50:02.060
This is their territory.

50:02.361 --> 50:04.751
Let's get the fuck out of here.

50:12.171 --> 50:14.629
I was in the Marines.

50:16.075 --> 50:18.910
Got called back from the war
when it started.

50:19.211 --> 50:21.513
What happened with the war?

50:21.814 --> 50:23.815
No one left to fight it.

50:24.116 --> 50:25.717
The Middle East is gone.

50:26.018 --> 50:26.918
Vamp land.

50:27.219 --> 50:29.154
How did you end up here?

50:29.455 --> 50:33.125
We were deployed to
see to the evacuation to Canada.

50:33.426 --> 50:35.793
Keep the peace.

50:36.896 --> 50:39.525
But we couldn't contain it.

50:40.266 --> 50:44.363
Most of their troops left,
tryin' to make it home to their families.

50:45.871 --> 50:48.573
I guess you heard
the President's dead.

50:48.874 --> 50:50.909
Which asshole's president now?

50:51.210 --> 50:52.611
Beats me.

50:52.912 --> 50:54.045
Way I see it,

50:54.346 --> 50:58.238
muthafuckas booked and left us
with our dick in our hands.

51:29.849 --> 51:32.184
<i>Baby don't you cry.</i>

51:32.485 --> 51:35.683
<i>Papa's gonna make sure don't...</i>

51:36.822 --> 51:37.522
Please help!

51:37.623 --> 51:38.323
No!

51:38.624 --> 51:39.658
Please!

51:39.959 --> 51:41.293
I need a doctor.

51:41.594 --> 51:42.527
The baby's coming.

51:42.828 --> 51:44.348
Where the hell
did you come from, girl?

51:44.396 --> 51:47.999
I'm traveling with three men,
but they can't help me.

51:48.300 --> 51:49.000
Where are they?

51:49.001 --> 51:51.095
Right behind you.

51:52.338 --> 51:54.372
You should have been an actress.

51:54.673 --> 51:55.574
What are they doing?

51:55.875 --> 51:58.355
They've been takin' out the
lockdown towns with captured vamps.

51:58.511 --> 52:02.346
They crash the trucks into roadblocks
and let the vamps do their thing.

52:04.283 --> 52:06.912
That's what took down Washington.

52:39.018 --> 52:41.249
Check the other one.

52:44.156 --> 52:46.523
Howdy, Clem.

52:53.432 --> 52:55.663
This your boy, Clem?

52:57.503 --> 52:59.563
Shit!

53:13.485 --> 53:16.080
Where's the woman?

53:16.422 --> 53:19.017
Bitch run off.

53:20.926 --> 53:23.521
We was just tryin'
to protect her.

53:32.238 --> 53:34.469
Run!

54:17.983 --> 54:21.252
<i>Vamps could smell blood
from miles off.</i>

54:21.553 --> 54:23.054
<i>Mister knew it.</i>

54:23.355 --> 54:26.314
<i>And so did Jebedia Loven.</i>

54:28.060 --> 54:30.689
<i>I could tell by
the look in his eye.</i>

55:01.226 --> 55:03.161
<i>We were movin' north.</i>

55:03.462 --> 55:04.562
<i>Away from The Brotherhood,</i>

55:04.863 --> 55:06.431
<i>skirting the Adirondacks</i>

55:06.732 --> 55:09.793
<i>Less towns, less people.</i>

55:16.642 --> 55:18.476
<i>Hadn't seen any vamps yet.</i>

55:18.777 --> 55:21.479
<i>Mister said it was too cold for
them up here in the mountains.</i>

55:21.780 --> 55:22.981
<i>They were cold-blooded.</i>

55:23.282 --> 55:25.150
<i>Like reptiles.</i>

55:25.451 --> 55:28.410
<i>When we hit the lowlands,
they'd be back.</i>

55:40.099 --> 55:41.379
<i>If you are
receiving this signal,</i>

55:41.567 --> 55:43.835
<i>you are approaching
the Strivington border.</i>

55:44.136 --> 55:47.272
<i>Under protection of the
United States volunteer militia.</i>

55:47.573 --> 55:48.606
<i>All those seeking asylum</i>

55:48.907 --> 55:51.309
<i>will be processed and
dealt with accordingly.</i>

55:51.610 --> 55:54.501
<i>Weapons will be confiscated...</i>

56:05.190 --> 56:06.124
You get 'em back when you leave.

56:07.459 --> 56:08.339
Where you comin' from?

56:08.360 --> 56:09.060
South.

56:09.194 --> 56:10.428
Lafayetteville.

56:10.729 --> 56:12.197
Any trouble with The Brotherhood?

56:12.498 --> 56:15.093
Nothin' we couldn't handle.

56:50.469 --> 56:53.071
<i>They renamed
their town Strivington.</i>

56:53.372 --> 56:55.673
<i>Said it all.</i>

56:55.974 --> 56:58.009
<i>It gave me hope for people.</i>

56:58.310 --> 57:01.303
<i>It gave me hope for New Eden.</i>

57:02.414 --> 57:05.009
<i>Sometimes hope is all ya got.</i>

59:52.618 --> 59:54.452
<i>And it was over, like that.</i>

59:54.753 --> 59:55.620
<i>All that goodness.</i>

59:55.921 --> 59:59.424
<i>Shattered by some Christian crazies
droppin' vamps from the sky.</i>

59:59.725 --> 01:00:01.559
We're gonna stay
right here till morning.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.227
Fine by me.

01:00:14.539 --> 01:00:17.236
How you doin', mama?

01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:35.158
She's gone.

01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:46.904
Tough old lady.

01:00:47.205 --> 01:00:50.471
Climbed those stairs
and didn't say a word.

01:01:36.788 --> 01:01:39.457
Damn Brotherhood shit-kickers.

01:01:39.758 --> 01:01:42.125
Ten dead.

01:01:43.528 --> 01:01:44.362
We've got things
under control now.

01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:47.724
We'll have this place
up and runnin' in no time.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.968
Sure you won't
stick around for a while?

01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:52.509
We could use a couple good men.

01:01:52.738 --> 01:01:53.438
No.

01:01:53.572 --> 01:01:55.962
We're headin' north.

01:01:57.876 --> 01:01:59.477
Stick to the back roads.

01:01:59.778 --> 01:02:01.512
They're the only way outta here.

01:02:01.813 --> 01:02:03.714
Brotherhood owns the rest.

01:02:04.015 --> 01:02:05.650
Good luck to you.

01:02:05.951 --> 01:02:08.045
Thanks.

01:02:52.063 --> 01:02:54.863
<i>We'd come far.</i>

01:02:56.268 --> 01:02:59.432
<i>We didn't know
what was waitin' for us.</i>

01:03:00.839 --> 01:03:04.435
<i>But anything had to be
better than what we left behind.</i>

01:03:07.312 --> 01:03:10.510
<i>At least I kept
telling myself that.</i>

01:03:10.849 --> 01:03:13.251
<i>But when I close my eyes,</i>

01:03:13.552 --> 01:03:15.219
<i>I kept seein' that
little girl's dead legs</i>

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.684
<i>stickin' out from under that tarp.</i>

01:03:36.308 --> 01:03:38.334
Ah, fuck.

01:03:41.613 --> 01:03:42.914
What is it?

01:03:43.215 --> 01:03:44.749
Fuckin' radiator.

01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:46.017
Can you fix it?

01:03:46.318 --> 01:03:47.418
Not this time.

01:03:47.719 --> 01:03:49.654
She's dead.

01:03:49.955 --> 01:03:53.153
Everybody grab your shit.

01:04:53.285 --> 01:04:56.520
<i>One week in the woods and
we were becoming different people.</i>

01:04:56.821 --> 01:04:58.656
<i>Small talk stopped.</i>

01:04:58.957 --> 01:05:02.758
<i>We worked as a pack,
each to his task.</i>

01:05:04.396 --> 01:05:10.034
<i>It was cold here in the hot passes,
but we hadn't seen any vamps.</i>

01:05:10.335 --> 01:05:13.704
<i>The forest cast
a kind of magic over us.</i>

01:05:14.005 --> 01:05:16.896
<i>Away from people.</i>

01:05:18.176 --> 01:05:20.411
<i>I stopped thinking
about the past.</i>

01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:22.680
<i>And about my family.</i>

01:05:22.981 --> 01:05:25.815
<i>I had found a new one.</i>

01:05:36.695 --> 01:05:39.324
You think we'll make it?

01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:41.198
I'm just worried about the girl.

01:05:41.499 --> 01:05:44.299
She's slowin' us down.

01:07:31.342 --> 01:07:34.472
There's no wind.

01:08:35.206 --> 01:08:37.368
Berserkers.

01:08:41.813 --> 01:08:43.941
Run!

01:08:59.363 --> 01:09:01.232
Come on!
We gotta run now, let's go.

01:09:01.533 --> 01:09:03.627
Move!

01:09:06.037 --> 01:09:08.234
She's comin'!

01:09:13.377 --> 01:09:14.211
No, no, no!
What are you doin'?!

01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:16.747
What are you doin'?!
We gotta go!

01:09:17.048 --> 01:09:19.313
Keep movin'!

01:09:19.617 --> 01:09:22.596
- Please, Please. We gotta move.
- I need one second!

01:09:23.321 --> 01:09:25.551
Sister?

01:09:26.591 --> 01:09:28.492
I got you, I got you.
Just a little bit further.

01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:30.557
Come on, keep moving.

01:09:34.532 --> 01:09:36.763
She's comin'!

01:09:40.071 --> 01:09:40.770
Keep going.

01:09:40.971 --> 01:09:41.812
Come on, we gotta go.

01:09:42.006 --> 01:09:44.100
We gotta go faster.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.985
Come on, you fuckers.

01:10:05.029 --> 01:10:06.563
The Lord is my strength.

01:10:06.864 --> 01:10:09.925
My Lord is my...

01:10:19.344 --> 01:10:21.643
Father,

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.413
forgive me.

01:10:56.414 --> 01:10:59.908
Martin, let's go.

01:11:05.156 --> 01:11:08.024
I don't think she's coming, Martin.

01:11:12.563 --> 01:11:14.953
Come on.

01:12:48.326 --> 01:12:51.695
<i>We've been travelin' for days
now and hadn't seen a soul.</i>

01:12:51.996 --> 01:12:54.998
<i>It was like people
had just disappeared.</i>

01:12:55.299 --> 01:12:58.463
<i>But Mister wasn't
takin' any chances.</i>

01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:02.132
What's wrong?

01:14:02.433 --> 01:14:04.301
Nothing.

01:14:04.602 --> 01:14:07.367
I'm just getting old and scary.

01:14:21.686 --> 01:14:22.519
You okay?

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.017
Oh, yeah...

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:28.458
Baby just kicked, I'm okay.

01:14:28.759 --> 01:14:29.993
Here, give me your hand.

01:14:30.294 --> 01:14:32.388
- Wanna feel?
- Yeah.

01:14:34.131 --> 01:14:35.933
Oh, wow.

01:14:36.234 --> 01:14:37.401
Let me check that out.

01:14:37.702 --> 01:14:39.830
Here, give me your hand, wait.

01:14:40.771 --> 01:14:41.931
That kid's got a strong kick.

01:14:42.106 --> 01:14:45.031
She's like, "Let me out,
I wanna meet everybody."

01:15:26.517 --> 01:15:27.217
Wake up.

01:15:27.251 --> 01:15:30.119
Get your boots on
and your guns ready.

01:15:30.721 --> 01:15:32.815
Willie's missin'.

01:16:28.212 --> 01:16:28.912
Something's dead.

01:16:29.046 --> 01:16:31.243
It's fresh.

01:16:53.838 --> 01:16:56.039
Jesus! Fuck...

01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.208
Oh, fuck.

01:16:58.509 --> 01:17:00.671
Oh, fuck.

01:17:01.345 --> 01:17:03.177
Fuck.

01:17:09.587 --> 01:17:12.011
Oh, my God...

01:17:15.259 --> 01:17:16.059
Come on. Come on.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.760
- Come on. We have to go.
- I can't.

01:17:17.862 --> 01:17:19.820
Come on.

01:17:22.066 --> 01:17:24.935
From now on you keep your
weapons close and ready.

01:17:25.236 --> 01:17:26.796
That thing took Willie
away to kill him.

01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:28.872
He got around our traps.

01:17:29.173 --> 01:17:30.374
What are you saying?

01:17:30.675 --> 01:17:32.509
This one uses its brain.

01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:34.050
I've seen a lot of mutant vamps

01:17:34.178 --> 01:17:37.137
but I ain't never seen
a thinker before.

01:18:24.762 --> 01:18:27.364
<i>We were entering the lowlands.</i>

01:18:27.665 --> 01:18:29.433
<i>New Eden was just beyond
the mountains.</i>

01:18:29.734 --> 01:18:30.934
<i>We were getting close.</i>

01:18:31.235 --> 01:18:33.770
<i>But so far
no sign of anything...</i>

01:18:34.071 --> 01:18:36.370
<i>Alive anyway.</i>

01:18:47.351 --> 01:18:49.513
You okay, girl?

01:18:50.821 --> 01:18:53.211
I have cramps.

01:18:54.191 --> 01:18:55.959
My back hurts really bad.

01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:56.960
I just...

01:18:57.094 --> 01:18:59.095
I just need to sit for a minute.

01:18:59.396 --> 01:19:00.430
I'm sorry.

01:19:00.731 --> 01:19:02.399
- We gotta keep movin'.
- I can't.

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.760
It's okay.

01:19:06.704 --> 01:19:08.969
I got you.

01:19:09.573 --> 01:19:11.963
You okay?

01:19:14.612 --> 01:19:18.048
My daddy used to carry me
like this when I was little.

01:19:18.349 --> 01:19:20.910
I'm not your daddy.

01:19:22.386 --> 01:19:25.777
You ain't such a hard ass,
you know.

01:19:51.715 --> 01:19:52.849
Let her sleep.

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:54.284
She needs it.

01:19:54.585 --> 01:19:58.283
At daylight were gonna put some
distance between us and this place.

01:20:01.192 --> 01:20:04.652
What are we gonna do
when the baby comes?

01:20:55.179 --> 01:20:56.580
Oh, fuck.

01:20:56.881 --> 01:20:58.941
Fuck.

01:21:11.028 --> 01:21:13.293
This way. It's close.

01:21:29.113 --> 01:21:30.547
That's her.

01:21:30.848 --> 01:21:32.908
That's her.

01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:35.239
Wait.

01:21:36.921 --> 01:21:39.516
It's leadin' us, boy.

01:21:42.526 --> 01:21:44.518
Tough shit.

01:22:41.251 --> 01:22:43.550
Drink up, boy.

01:22:53.097 --> 01:22:55.031
I am a vengeful god.

01:22:55.332 --> 01:22:56.332
Eye for eye.

01:22:56.633 --> 01:22:57.667
Tooth for tooth.

01:22:57.968 --> 01:23:00.893
Son for son.

01:23:01.805 --> 01:23:05.697
This is between me and you,
you bloodsuckin' son-of-a-bitch.

01:23:22.192 --> 01:23:26.096
When you left me for them,
I prayed.

01:23:26.397 --> 01:23:31.028
I prayed and God listened.

01:23:31.368 --> 01:23:34.104
So when they came for me,

01:23:34.405 --> 01:23:36.606
the hungry ones,

01:23:36.907 --> 01:23:41.868
I gave my blood, willingly, hunter.

01:23:47.484 --> 01:23:49.749
Thank you.

01:23:51.855 --> 01:23:56.122
I am your God now.

01:24:01.899 --> 01:24:05.324
Nice try, child.

01:24:05.636 --> 01:24:07.867
Try this, you fucker.

01:25:51.909 --> 01:25:54.572
'Bout time you learn how to drive.

01:25:57.347 --> 01:25:59.475
<i>Almost there.</i>

01:25:59.783 --> 01:26:01.651
<i>Almost.</i>

01:26:01.952 --> 01:26:04.649
<i>'Almost' is a big word.</i>

01:26:17.201 --> 01:26:19.261
Fuck.

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:19.050
Hold it right there!

01:27:21.331 --> 01:27:23.823
Don't move.

01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:35.102
Thank you.

01:27:35.445 --> 01:27:37.013
You boys look like hell.

01:27:37.314 --> 01:27:38.014
Shit happens.

01:27:38.315 --> 01:27:39.816
Yeah, sure does.

01:27:40.117 --> 01:27:41.517
But like my mom used to say,

01:27:41.818 --> 01:27:44.554
"Things are what they are.
Get used to 'em."

01:27:44.855 --> 01:27:46.022
Smart woman.

01:27:46.323 --> 01:27:48.091
She owned this place.

01:27:48.392 --> 01:27:51.127
Last stop before the wilderness.

01:27:51.428 --> 01:27:53.863
Buried her out back and
I've been on my own ever since.

01:27:54.164 --> 01:27:56.265
Except for them.

01:27:56.566 --> 01:27:57.867
It's good shootin'.

01:27:58.168 --> 01:27:59.202
Lots of practice.

01:27:59.503 --> 01:28:01.768
I'm gonna take a look around.

01:28:09.913 --> 01:28:12.144
What's your name?

01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:14.684
Martin.

01:28:14.985 --> 01:28:17.352
I'm Peggy.

01:28:20.490 --> 01:28:23.688
It's been a long time
since I seen a boy.

01:28:56.226 --> 01:28:58.115
Come on.

01:28:59.262 --> 01:29:01.754
You gotta wait 'til it's in the lot.

01:29:02.532 --> 01:29:03.933
What's wrong with it?

01:29:04.234 --> 01:29:06.135
They're runnin' out of food
so they're...

01:29:06.436 --> 01:29:08.894
skinnier but meaner.

01:29:10.407 --> 01:29:12.740
It smells us now.

01:29:18.515 --> 01:29:19.682
Oh shit.

01:29:19.983 --> 01:29:21.984
It's Walter again.

01:29:22.285 --> 01:29:23.452
I went to high school with him

01:29:23.453 --> 01:29:25.521
and I haven't been able
to get a clean shot.

01:29:25.822 --> 01:29:27.950
He was such an asshole.

01:29:29.259 --> 01:29:31.360
I'll get him.

01:29:31.661 --> 01:29:32.361
Martin!

01:29:32.496 --> 01:29:33.663
No, stop!

01:29:33.964 --> 01:29:36.627
Get in here.
What are you doing?

01:29:36.933 --> 01:29:38.993
Martin!
