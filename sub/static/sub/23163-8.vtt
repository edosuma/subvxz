WEBVTT

02:16.952 --> 02:18.579
<i>Stop, or I'll shoot.</i>

02:18.654 --> 02:20.087
<i>Higgins, no, it's me!</i>

02:25.527 --> 02:29.486
<i>To quote, "Higgins, I won't be home
all night. I have to do surveillance."</i>

02:29.565 --> 02:32.159
<i>And that was the truth. I had
a change of plans, I came home,</i>

02:32.234 --> 02:33.258
I went to bed early.

02:33.335 --> 02:35.166
<i>Fully clothed, wearing gloves?</i>

02:35.237 --> 02:38.035
<i>All right, yes, I sneaked in
and got your security keys.</i>

02:38.107 --> 02:39.699
But not to put
something over on you.

02:39.775 --> 02:41.003
I just didn't want to wake you.

02:41.076 --> 02:44.443
How considerate. Please remove that
mindless game from the computer.

02:45.347 --> 02:47.440
<i>I can't. This instant, Magnum. I insist.</i>

02:47.516 --> 02:49.507
<i>Pull your disk and leave.
I told you, I can't.</i>

02:49.585 --> 02:51.576
<i>For God's sake,
it's 2:00 a. M!</i>

02:51.653 --> 02:53.018
And I couldn't sleep.

02:53.088 --> 02:55.784
<i>Look, I just wanna wind down,
Higgins. I had a terrible day.</i>

02:55.858 --> 02:58.122
I was right on the verge of
cracking this big gambling case

02:58.193 --> 02:59.455
<i>I've been working on,
when the...</i>

02:59.528 --> 03:01.462
When you had a
chronic attack of adolescence.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.430
No. When my suspect
flew off to Maui.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.359
<i>Higgins, what are you doing?
No!</i>

03:08.470 --> 03:10.028
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

03:10.439 --> 03:12.339
Now I'm gonna have
to buy T.C. A new game.

03:12.408 --> 03:13.875
I told you you
couldn't turn it off.

03:13.942 --> 03:15.910
It's programmed to
erase if you stop it.

03:15.978 --> 03:18.674
Don't be ridiculous. Why
should anyone devise such a toy?

03:19.014 --> 03:22.177
'Cause Siege of the
Seventh Galaxy is not a toy.

03:22.251 --> 03:24.981
It is designed for the adult who
yearns for the risk and challenge

03:25.054 --> 03:27.045
of true-life
intergalactic combat.

03:27.322 --> 03:28.414
Stop!

03:28.490 --> 03:30.720
What are you doing?
I'm reformatting.

03:32.628 --> 03:34.061
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

03:35.731 --> 03:37.392
You've destroyed New Delhi.

03:37.699 --> 03:39.064
I've what?

03:39.134 --> 03:42.399
<i>My second campaign in India. Three
months of mind-wrenching labor,</i>

03:42.471 --> 03:46.066
<i>five complete chapters, an
entire era of my life, gone!</i>

03:46.475 --> 03:48.670
Why did you
reformat the main drive?

03:48.744 --> 03:50.211
I was trying to delete it.

03:50.279 --> 03:52.213
That game cost $59.95.

03:52.281 --> 03:55.250
Game? You dare to mention
that game at this moment.

03:55.317 --> 03:56.614
New Delhi is lost!

03:56.685 --> 03:58.550
<i>Well, so is the Seventh Galaxy.</i>

03:59.788 --> 04:02.256
<i>Oh, let's just forget it.
I've got to get some rest.</i>

04:02.324 --> 04:04.349
I've got to be
downtown in five hours.

04:04.426 --> 04:07.827
Then I suggest you leave now.
It's a very long walk.

04:08.764 --> 04:10.698
No. You can't do that.

04:10.766 --> 04:13.599
I have to stay on that casino
case. I'm real close to breaking it.

04:13.669 --> 04:15.500
You said your
suspect flew to Maui.

04:15.571 --> 04:18.938
<i>But not his office. Look, Higgins,
I'm sorry about your memoirs.</i>

04:19.007 --> 04:20.940
Then accept just punishment.

04:21.009 --> 04:23.239
Punishment?
It wasn't my fault.

04:23.312 --> 04:25.303
<i>The Ferrari keys, Magnum.
Now.</i>

04:25.380 --> 04:28.577
<i>And the keys to my other vehicles
are to be delivered to me, as well.</i>

04:28.650 --> 04:29.776
Your vehicles?

04:31.286 --> 04:34.050
The vehicles Mr. Masters
has placed in my care.

04:34.123 --> 04:37.149
<i>No, no, no. You think of
them as your own, don't you?</i>

04:37.226 --> 04:39.626
<i>Your cars,
your house, your computer,</i>

04:39.695 --> 04:42.186
so you can use them to
threaten me and manipulate me.

04:42.264 --> 04:43.561
You're being quite childish.

04:43.632 --> 04:45.224
<i>And you're being petty,
Higgins. Real petty.</i>

04:45.300 --> 04:47.234
I'm being emphatic! The keys!

04:47.302 --> 04:48.530
<i>Oh, Hig...</i>

04:50.739 --> 04:52.900
You're right.
It was a stupid thing to do.

04:52.975 --> 04:55.705
I'll give you the other keys
in the morning. Good night.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.725
<i>Seven years is a long time
to share common ground</i>

05:12.794 --> 05:15.786
<i>with someone whom you
share no common ground.</i>

05:15.864 --> 05:18.731
<i>But if there's one thing that
Higgins and I do share in common,</i>

05:18.800 --> 05:20.768
<i>it's our passion
for competition.</i>

05:20.836 --> 05:23.396
<i>We're even sporting enough to
give each other an advantage.</i>

05:23.472 --> 05:25.201
<i>For instance,
I gave Higgins the edge</i>

05:25.274 --> 05:27.742
<i>by handing over the car keys
without a fight.</i>

05:27.809 --> 05:31.472
<i>That told him for sure that I had no
intention of giving up the Ferrari.</i>

05:31.547 --> 05:34.414
<i>The funny part was that he
didn't try to use the advantage</i>

05:34.483 --> 05:35.814
<i>and stop me from leaving.</i>

05:35.884 --> 05:38.876
<i>But then if there's one other
thing Higgins and I have in common,</i>

05:38.954 --> 05:40.216
<i>it's a respect for work.</i>

05:40.289 --> 05:43.725
<i>I mean, no matter how mad he might
have been about the loss of his memoirs,</i>

05:43.792 --> 05:48.252
<i>he would never have been petty enough to
stand in my way of attending to business.</i>

05:50.732 --> 05:53.428
<i>Even business as trivial
as breaking and entering.</i>

05:57.573 --> 05:58.733
Hi.

06:00.609 --> 06:02.941
<i>What were you
doing in my office, Magnum?</i>

06:03.812 --> 06:05.507
Have we met?
No.

06:05.814 --> 06:08.374
But that hasn't stopped you
from following me around.

06:08.684 --> 06:09.981
Where'd you hear that?

06:10.052 --> 06:12.919
Same place I heard you were
gonna break in here this morning.

06:14.056 --> 06:15.580
<i>Wait a minute, Bill Nahli.</i>

06:16.558 --> 06:18.719
You have to be Bill Nahli.

06:18.894 --> 06:20.759
And you think I've
been following you?

06:20.829 --> 06:23.297
<i>This is funny, see, 'cause
I'm a private investigator.</i>

06:23.365 --> 06:24.662
That I know.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.500
Working for who?
You.

06:28.103 --> 06:31.163
Your company hired
me to do efficiency reports.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.003
Now do you see why it's funny?

06:33.742 --> 06:35.300
<i>Hey, wait a minute...</i>

06:36.645 --> 06:40.103
<i>Yeah, it's very funny, since
we're closed for vacation.</i>

06:40.182 --> 06:43.447
<i>But then, you knew that. You watched
me take off for Maui yesterday.</i>

06:44.052 --> 06:48.989
<i>Okay. Give me my camera, move your
cars, and I'll come back next week.</i>

06:49.458 --> 06:52.825
<i>No, you won't. I don't believe
you're working for me, Magnum.</i>

06:53.595 --> 06:55.790
<i>But if you are, you're fired.</i>

06:59.268 --> 07:00.701
<i>Hey, wait, my camera.</i>

07:02.738 --> 07:03.932
It was yours.

07:07.242 --> 07:08.732
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>

07:09.978 --> 07:12.811
<i>If there's a third thing that
Higgins and I have in common,</i>

07:12.881 --> 07:15.782
<i>it's an expert knowledge
of evasion techniques.</i>

07:16.051 --> 07:18.576
<i>I'd have to be
expertly evasive with T.C.</i>

07:18.654 --> 07:22.249
<i>Until I came up
with $1,259.95,</i>

07:22.391 --> 07:26.054
<i>the cost of one destroyed computer
disk and one misplaced camera.</i>

07:27.496 --> 07:30.260
<i>And I had no doubt that Higgins
would be evasive with me,</i>

07:30.332 --> 07:33.665
<i>rather than admit that he'd
overreacted in taking my car keys.</i>

07:34.336 --> 07:36.702
<i>But then, I knew how much
his memoirs meant to him,</i>

07:36.772 --> 07:40.367
<i>so I decided if he apologized,
I'd be nice about it.</i>

07:40.709 --> 07:43.109
<i>I might even
offer to pay my fine.</i>

07:43.178 --> 07:46.113
<i>Officer, I'm sorry, I meant
to fasten my seatbelt, but I...</i>

07:46.214 --> 07:48.114
You're under arrest
for grand theft auto.

07:49.084 --> 07:50.847
You have the right
to remain silent.

07:50.952 --> 07:53.546
<i>Anything you say
could be disastrous,</i>

07:54.356 --> 07:59.157
<i>so please speak in the warmest,
gentlest, most complimentary tones.</i>

07:59.227 --> 08:03.561
<i>Yes, yes. We must take no chance of
disturbing the cereus before tomorrow.</i>

08:03.632 --> 08:04.997
<i>No, of course not.</i>

08:05.667 --> 08:07.658
<i>Jonathan, isn't it exciting?</i>

08:09.404 --> 08:11.998
You and Mr. Obata
could become famous.

08:12.274 --> 08:15.471
<i>Agatha, this is hardly the first
inducement of a daylight blooming</i>

08:15.544 --> 08:17.671
<i>of the
Cereus Mandevillus hybrid.</i>

08:17.746 --> 08:19.976
<i>However, our technique
is quite original.</i>

08:20.115 --> 08:22.811
We've managed to interrupt
the natural sex cycle.

08:22.884 --> 08:24.408
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

08:24.486 --> 08:28.320
Mr. Higgins and I have discovered
that the normal behavior

08:28.390 --> 08:31.882
of the cereus can be reversed
by restricting pollination.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.120
Higgins!

08:40.501 --> 08:43.164
<i>I can't believe you
did that, Higgins!</i>

08:43.238 --> 08:45.433
<i>Mr. Magnum, please, don't
yell. Think of the cereus.</i>

08:45.507 --> 08:48.567
<i>You bet it's serious. Mr. Obata is
referring to the Cereus Mandevillus.</i>

08:48.643 --> 08:51.635
You might disturb them before
tomorrow's International Hawaiian show.

08:51.713 --> 08:53.977
Flowers? Are you serious?

08:54.049 --> 08:55.846
You want to talk
about upset flowers?

08:55.917 --> 08:58.317
<i>What about me, Higgins?
I'm very upset.</i>

08:58.720 --> 09:02.383
<i>Perhaps you could explain your
anger, Mr. Magnum, in cooler tones.</i>

09:02.457 --> 09:04.448
Higgins had Thomas arrested.

09:04.526 --> 09:06.585
Arrested? Jonathan!

09:06.661 --> 09:08.253
<i>Agatha, please.</i>

09:08.563 --> 09:12.090
<i>Magnum, am I to understand that it was
you who took the Ferrari this morning?</i>

09:12.167 --> 09:13.725
<i>Oh, come on, you knew I had it.</i>

09:13.802 --> 09:16.669
No. I reported it stolen
because you vowed not to use it.

09:16.738 --> 09:19.502
It never occurred to me that
you might go back on your word.

09:19.574 --> 09:21.474
<i>Oh, cute.</i>

09:21.943 --> 09:24.912
<i>Okay, just drop the charges,
I'll go get the car,</i>

09:24.980 --> 09:26.174
and we'll forget
the whole thing.

09:26.248 --> 09:28.580
<i>I'll drop the charges,
of course.</i>

09:28.650 --> 09:30.481
But a vow is a vow.

09:30.552 --> 09:33.316
You can't drive the car
for six days and 11 hours.

09:33.622 --> 09:35.089
Which will give
you an opportunity

09:35.157 --> 09:38.593
to make an emotional commitment
to your groundskeeping duties.

09:39.027 --> 09:40.426
I do hope you understand.

09:40.495 --> 09:41.655
Understand?

09:49.671 --> 09:52.367
Sure. I understand.

09:54.443 --> 09:55.671
No problem.

10:00.615 --> 10:02.173
He had me arrested.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.411
<i>Thomas, how many more times
are you going to say that?</i>

10:04.486 --> 10:06.249
<i>Come on, Higgins already
explained what happened.</i>

10:06.321 --> 10:07.515
And you believed him?

10:07.589 --> 10:10.854
<i>Well, I wanted to believe that he meant
what he said about dropping the charges.</i>

10:10.926 --> 10:13.224
<i>I mean, I need the two grand bail money back.</i>

10:13.295 --> 10:14.728
<i>Well, don't worry.</i>

10:14.796 --> 10:17.890
He will straighten things out with
the police. He has made his point.

10:17.966 --> 10:20.730
What was he trying to prove about
that emotional commitment stuff?

10:20.802 --> 10:23.430
That is just his way of
reminding me that I promised

10:23.505 --> 10:26.804
to help out with the lawn work
while he was busy on his project.

10:28.009 --> 10:30.705
<i>Here they are, my secret set.</i>

10:31.112 --> 10:33.910
Are you crazy? Are you gonna
try and get the Ferrari?

10:34.316 --> 10:35.578
Of course not.

10:35.650 --> 10:38.642
I just wanted to find these so I
could give them back to Higgins.

10:39.688 --> 10:42.623
<i>Hey, man.
Where is my camera?</i>

10:42.691 --> 10:45.421
<i>T. C., where the hell have you been?
I needed help with the bail money.</i>

10:45.494 --> 10:48.429
<i>Well, you two had already left the
station by the time I got there.</i>

10:48.597 --> 10:50.189
Where is the camera?

10:50.265 --> 10:53.462
Safe. I put it in the car
and the car's been impounded.

10:53.602 --> 10:56.571
It is not in the car.
I had the police check.

10:56.638 --> 10:59.471
Oh. Okay. Then have this film
developed for me.

10:59.541 --> 11:00.735
Do what?

11:00.809 --> 11:03.607
<i>Well, I don't wanna ask Higgins
to use the darkroom right now.</i>

11:03.678 --> 11:07.045
And this film is
the key to your camera.

11:09.718 --> 11:11.310
They usually go together.

11:11.386 --> 11:14.116
So why is this film
not with my camera?

11:14.189 --> 11:18.319
Because I switched it before
Nahli's guy grabbed your camera.

11:18.527 --> 11:21.428
<i>But don't worry, we'll get
it back, when we nail Nahli.</i>

11:21.496 --> 11:22.861
<i>Hold it, hold it.</i>

11:24.599 --> 11:25.998
Who's Nahli?

11:26.268 --> 11:28.828
The head of the biggest
gambling ring in the Islands.

11:29.604 --> 11:31.572
And that film could prove it.

11:31.806 --> 11:34.673
It's a list addresses I
shot in his office files.

11:34.743 --> 11:36.540
Casino locations?

11:36.645 --> 11:39.079
I'll know for sure
if T.C. Will develop the film

11:39.147 --> 11:40.774
and if you'll check
some of the addresses.

11:40.849 --> 11:42.407
<i>Me?
Rick, please.</i>

11:42.484 --> 11:44.452
I can't do it.
Nahli knows me now.

11:44.519 --> 11:46.987
I wonder how he could have
found out that I was tailing him.

11:47.055 --> 11:49.421
I wonder why I'm not in
there trying to kill him.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.516
<i>That's a $1,200 camera.</i>

11:51.593 --> 11:55.495
<i>So, can you please just help me
find it by developing that film?</i>

11:59.367 --> 12:01.835
<i>I'll get the prints to you
as soon as I can, Rick.</i>

12:02.237 --> 12:04.933
<i>And in the meantime, Rick,
could you talk to Ice Pick?</i>

12:05.006 --> 12:06.530
He may know about
Nahli's operations.

12:06.608 --> 12:10.009
<i>Thomas, Ice Pick,
you got to understand.</i>

12:10.078 --> 12:13.912
It's not that easy. Every time I
go to him I owe him another favor.

12:14.049 --> 12:15.607
But this is important.

12:15.684 --> 12:17.549
It's always important.
So what're you gonna do?

12:17.619 --> 12:19.553
You gonna take
a nap until I get back?

12:20.021 --> 12:23.718
<i>No, I'm gonna commit myself
to some "cereus" lawn work.</i>

12:34.703 --> 12:37.001
What in God's
name are you doing?

12:37.973 --> 12:40.806
Higgins. Is something wrong?

12:43.578 --> 12:45.512
You've just destroyed
my chance to become

12:45.580 --> 12:48.743
<i>the first person to exhibit a
day-blooming Cereus Mandevillus.</i>

12:49.084 --> 12:52.713
You know how hard I've worked on
this project. You've gone too far!

12:52.787 --> 12:53.947
<i>Higgins, they weren't blooming.</i>

12:54.022 --> 12:55.580
Of course they're not blooming!

12:55.657 --> 12:58.490
They'll only bloom during
the daytime in a dark room!

13:00.895 --> 13:03.295
I thought they were useless.
Honest.

13:03.932 --> 13:05.263
I'm sorry.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.499
I just got
emotionally committed.

13:11.139 --> 13:12.663
It's a logical error.

13:15.076 --> 13:16.634
I understand.

13:21.416 --> 13:23.714
<i>I know what
you're thinking, and, sure,</i>

13:23.785 --> 13:26.618
<i>I knew Higgins and I were
getting a little out of hand.</i>

13:26.688 --> 13:29.919
<i>But if there's a fourth thing
that Higgins and I have in common,</i>

13:29.991 --> 13:33.757
<i>it's an adult, sensitive, rational
attitude towards our problems.</i>

13:34.095 --> 13:36.689
<i>We've always
known where to draw the line.</i>

14:13.817 --> 14:16.843
<i>I suggest we try a normal,
nocturnal sex cycle.</i>

14:16.953 --> 14:21.356
Yes. And then attempt to interrupt the
pollination again before the competition.

14:21.525 --> 14:23.186
<i>Good morning,
Higgins, Mr. Obata.</i>

14:23.593 --> 14:25.823
<i>Magnum, you're up early.
Didn't you sleep well?</i>

14:25.896 --> 14:28.956
I slept great.
Any reason I shouldn't have?

14:29.332 --> 14:31.197
<i>No. No, of course not.</i>

14:31.301 --> 14:34.634
<i>What's the condition of the
cereus? Not serious, I hope.</i>

14:35.839 --> 14:38.706
<i>I'm glad you can find humor
in the situation, Mr. Magnum.</i>

14:38.909 --> 14:40.467
<i>Yeah, I'm glad I can, too.</i>

14:41.311 --> 14:42.938
<i>Magnum, what do you want?</i>

14:43.013 --> 14:45.345
I would like to
borrow some adhesive tape.

14:46.049 --> 14:48.779
<i>Did you hurt yourself?
No, it's for a friend.</i>

14:49.052 --> 14:52.510
<i>I'll just get some out of the medicine
cabinet, if that's okay. Thanks.</i>

14:53.390 --> 14:55.824
<i>Magnum, wait.
Something's troubling you.</i>

14:56.493 --> 14:58.791
Why aren't you asleep?
It's the crack of dawn.

14:58.862 --> 15:01.262
<i>I have duties
to perform here, remember?</i>

15:01.431 --> 15:03.365
<i>Not more lawn work, I trust?</i>

15:03.433 --> 15:05.867
<i>No, Mr. Obata. Security.</i>

15:05.936 --> 15:07.494
<i>I check the grounds,
keep an eye out</i>

15:07.571 --> 15:10.665
for any old dangerous weapons
that might be left lying around.

15:10.740 --> 15:12.037
Things like that.

15:12.909 --> 15:14.342
Old dangerous weapons?

15:14.411 --> 15:16.709
<i>It's okay, Higgins.
I took care of the problem.</i>

15:50.981 --> 15:53.040
You and Higgins have
been playing stupid games

15:53.116 --> 15:54.708
while I've been out
doing your work.

15:54.784 --> 15:57.776
<i>No, Higgins is playing games.
I'm just trying to resolve things.</i>

15:57.854 --> 16:00.687
<i>I mean, I did make a concrete
effort to end this feud.</i>

16:00.757 --> 16:04.090
<i>Hey, it's not funny, Thomas. If you
really wanted to stop this fight,</i>

16:04.161 --> 16:05.924
you would have never
plugged up his cannon.

16:05.996 --> 16:08.521
He beheaded my chicken. After
you beheaded his flowers.

16:08.598 --> 16:09.826
After he had me arrested.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.095
After you stole the Ferrari.
I didn't steal it.

16:12.169 --> 16:14.364
Which means that the whole
fight started over nothing.

16:14.437 --> 16:16.064
<i>So drop it.
And do me a favor,</i>

16:16.139 --> 16:19.666
do your own investigation from
now on. I got better things to do.

16:19.743 --> 16:22.735
<i>Well, will you just tell me what
you found out about Bill Nahli?</i>

16:22.812 --> 16:25.372
<i>Oh, yeah. As soon as you tell
me what all this junk is for.</i>

16:25.448 --> 16:28.042
<i>Well, it's just... It's
kind of insurance, you know,</i>

16:28.118 --> 16:29.983
that I hope I don't have to use.

16:30.053 --> 16:31.782
<i>Now, what did Ice Pick
have to say?</i>

16:31.855 --> 16:34.653
The casino locations are
the best kept secret in town.

16:34.758 --> 16:37.090
Nahli and his boss
cater to the tourist crowd.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.560
<i>This way, they don't have to mess
around with the cops or the syndicate.</i>

16:39.629 --> 16:40.960
Nahli has a boss?

16:41.031 --> 16:42.999
And that is
the other best kept secret.

16:43.066 --> 16:45.364
<i>Ice Pick's been trying to get a
lead on the big guy for months,</i>

16:45.435 --> 16:46.902
but so far... Nothing.

16:47.237 --> 16:50.900
<i>Well, maybe you can find a
lead at one of those addresses.</i>

16:51.441 --> 16:54.877
<i>And that is the last favor I'm gonna do
for you, Thomas, and you remember that.</i>

16:54.945 --> 16:56.572
You better straighten
this thing out with Higgins.

16:56.646 --> 16:59.046
I will. All he has to do
is come and talk to me.

17:04.554 --> 17:06.044
Got your prints.

17:07.022 --> 17:08.455
<i>Yeah, thanks, T.C.</i>

17:10.660 --> 17:12.719
<i>Well, don't get too excited.</i>

17:12.796 --> 17:16.027
<i>I mean, I only stayed up till
midnight trying to get those developed.</i>

17:16.098 --> 17:18.226
<i>Hey, these are all
residential addresses.</i>

17:18.300 --> 17:21.429
Of course. Nahli's not gonna
have his casinos in Waikiki.

17:21.503 --> 17:25.440
Maybe you can sneak a look at the first
few houses and call me if you find anything.

17:25.508 --> 17:27.976
Yeah. Like my camera.

17:28.478 --> 17:30.844
<i>And speaking of my property,</i>

17:30.981 --> 17:35.213
I think maybe I'd better pick
up my disk before it gets lost.

17:36.820 --> 17:38.117
Right.

17:39.889 --> 17:43.381
It must be in this
big pile of junk.

17:54.904 --> 17:58.840
<i>Higgins!
Higgins, open the door!</i>

18:00.043 --> 18:02.443
<i>But Mr. Magnum,
you can't come in.</i>

18:02.612 --> 18:04.204
We're pollinating.

18:06.416 --> 18:09.112
I want to see Higgins now!

18:09.719 --> 18:11.311
<i>Magnum, go away!</i>

18:13.757 --> 18:16.225
<i>No, don't let in the daylight!</i>

18:18.428 --> 18:21.522
<i>The blooms are closing!
Shut the door, shut the door.</i>

18:27.871 --> 18:30.999
<i>Where's my stuff, Higgins?</i>

18:31.141 --> 18:33.666
I have no idea
what you mean by your stuff.

18:33.743 --> 18:35.938
<i>But our competition begins
in exactly three hours,</i>

18:36.012 --> 18:38.242
<i>and if these Cereus
Mandevillus blooms are not open,</i>

18:38.315 --> 18:40.249
you are to be held
directly responsible.

18:40.317 --> 18:42.751
You cleaned out my closet.

18:43.219 --> 18:44.914
Yes. You said you wished
to make a contribution

18:44.988 --> 18:47.388
to the Home for Incorrigible
Boys Equipment Drive.

18:47.457 --> 18:51.257
<i>A contribution, yes.
But not my entire closet.</i>

18:51.728 --> 18:52.888
I didn't know that.

18:52.962 --> 18:54.554
You had most of
the closet's contents

18:54.631 --> 18:57.225
lying out in the room
when the collectors arrived.

18:57.334 --> 18:59.825
You gave away everything.

19:00.537 --> 19:05.998
<i>My gorilla mask, my Tiger
uniform, my Al Kaline bat.</i>

19:10.547 --> 19:12.981
I had no idea these tokens
meant so much to you.

19:14.284 --> 19:17.720
<i>If I had, believe me, I would
not have given them away.</i>

19:21.091 --> 19:23.059
The blooms are opening again!

19:23.793 --> 19:26.421
<i>Oh, Jonathan, we're saved!</i>

19:43.480 --> 19:45.209
<i>Yes, yes, I'm coming.</i>

19:47.150 --> 19:48.742
Robin Masters' Estate.

19:49.619 --> 19:53.646
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello.

20:27.957 --> 20:30.755
<i>I'm very, very sorry, but all the donations</i>

20:30.827 --> 20:33.022
<i>have already been
distributed to the boys.</i>

20:33.096 --> 20:36.190
<i>Look, could you just try and
find a few of the things for me?</i>

20:38.134 --> 20:40.728
<i>Just a second,
Mrs. Hunter. Hello?</i>

20:40.937 --> 20:43.735
<i>Thomas, I checked out
a couple of those addresses.</i>

20:43.807 --> 20:45.240
<i>You were right.
Vegas in the basements.</i>

20:45.308 --> 20:46.468
<i>That's great, Rick, but...</i>

20:46.543 --> 20:49.171
<i>Listen to this, Nahli was
at one of the casinos.</i>

20:49.245 --> 20:51.577
<i>I got a shot of him
before his goons spotted me.</i>

20:51.648 --> 20:53.513
<i>Rick, can I call you back?
Thanks.</i>

20:53.583 --> 20:56.518
<i>Mrs. Hunter? Yes, Mr. Magnum. I'm still here.</i>

20:56.586 --> 20:59.316
Good. There's
a Detroit Tiger

20:59.389 --> 21:02.017
baseball uniform in the
stuff that Higgins sent you.

21:02.091 --> 21:03.581
It really means a lot to me.

21:04.894 --> 21:07.158
<i>Don't go away,
Mrs. Hunter. Hello?</i>

21:07.464 --> 21:11.332
<i>Thomas, did Rick call you? He
found Nahli. We can get my camera.</i>

21:11.401 --> 21:13.665
<i>Meet us at... Yeah, T.
C., I'll call you back.</i>

21:14.037 --> 21:15.299
Mrs. Hunter?

21:15.371 --> 21:18.033
<i>Mr. Magnum, it's obvious
that we're both very busy.</i>

21:18.107 --> 21:19.540
<i>No, no, no.</i>

21:19.676 --> 21:21.303
There's just a few more things.

21:21.878 --> 21:25.109
<i>There's a baseball bat and a
gorilla mask... A gorilla mask?</i>

21:25.181 --> 21:26.910
<i>I know, I know.</i>

21:27.183 --> 21:29.048
<i>It's kind of silly to
miss a gorilla mask, but...</i>

21:30.253 --> 21:32.414
Damn!
Mrs. Hunter...

21:34.290 --> 21:35.587
Mrs. Hunter?

21:36.659 --> 21:38.559
<i>Whoever it is,
I'll have to call you back.</i>

21:38.628 --> 21:40.493
<i>No, Magnum, we talk now.</i>

21:40.563 --> 21:44.055
<i>It's Bill Nahli.
We need to have a meeting.</i>

21:44.367 --> 21:48.303
<i>2:00 in the old abandoned Marina
Medical Building. And come alone.</i>

21:59.115 --> 22:02.243
<i>If there's a fifth thing that
Higgins and I have in common,</i>

22:02.318 --> 22:04.513
<i>it's a pragmatic sentimentality.</i>

22:04.721 --> 22:08.452
<i>We only hold on to things that have
some practical use in the present.</i>

22:08.725 --> 22:11.853
<i>Old bats that still had a
few long balls left in them,</i>

22:12.128 --> 22:14.358
<i>old cannons that
could still fire.</i>

22:15.031 --> 22:19.365
<i>But I'd begun to wonder if we were
as practical about old attitudes.</i>

22:19.602 --> 22:21.502
<i>Maybe Higgins and I
had unconsciously</i>

22:21.571 --> 22:25.234
<i>decided to freshen up some old
fights by going outside the rules.</i>

22:25.308 --> 22:27.674
<i>And I suddenly realized
that maybe Bill Nahli</i>

22:27.744 --> 22:30.611
<i>wasn't staying within
the announced rules either.</i>

22:30.813 --> 22:32.110
Nahli?

22:43.393 --> 22:44.621
Higgins!

22:49.265 --> 22:50.789
What are you up to?

22:57.707 --> 23:00.904
<i>I'm up to between the second
and third floors, I believe.</i>

23:01.110 --> 23:04.102
<i>And trapped here indefinitely,
thanks to you.</i>

23:09.434 --> 23:12.460
Don't be absurd. How should
I know why we're in here.

23:12.637 --> 23:15.902
Because you set it up. You must
have found out I was meeting Nahli.

23:17.342 --> 23:18.900
What name did you say?

23:18.977 --> 23:20.638
<i>Nahli, Higgins. Bill Nahli.</i>

23:20.712 --> 23:23.875
The guy I've been tailing. Don't
tell me you've never heard of him.

23:26.484 --> 23:27.849
<i>Well, I...</i>

23:28.286 --> 23:32.188
I know him by reputation.
He's a respected businessman.

23:32.257 --> 23:35.249
He's a crook. And he wanted to strike a deal

23:35.327 --> 23:38.455
to give me his big casino boss's
name. Did you set that up too?

23:38.997 --> 23:40.555
Of course not.

23:40.632 --> 23:41.963
Then why are you here?

23:44.602 --> 23:47.537
You stole the Ferrari again.
I followed you to collect it.

23:48.573 --> 23:50.734
<i>If you followed me,
how'd you get here first?</i>

23:50.809 --> 23:54.643
<i>No, Higgins, you were cooking something
up to get back at me for the bridge.</i>

23:54.713 --> 23:56.010
<i>Ah, yes, get back at you.</i>

23:56.081 --> 23:58.276
<i>Tit for tat, cut and
thrust, an eye for an eye,</i>

23:58.350 --> 24:00.011
a Roland for an Oliver.

24:00.085 --> 24:01.746
A Roland for an Oliver?

24:01.820 --> 24:05.779
<i>Childish retaliations to the
end. Well, I've cooked up nothing.</i>

24:05.857 --> 24:09.486
So claim your victory and your
delirious rampage of devastation.

24:09.561 --> 24:12.462
My rampage?
Who devastated my chicken?

24:12.530 --> 24:15.328
Who deliriously
gave away all my stuff?

24:15.400 --> 24:18.028
How dare you
claim equitable vindication?

24:18.103 --> 24:19.832
<i>You destroyed my
milestone experiment,</i>

24:19.904 --> 24:22.134
my most prized
possessions and my history.

24:22.207 --> 24:24.175
I merely dispensed
with a few baubles.

24:24.242 --> 24:27.143
<i>Baubles?
Yes, Magnum, baubles. Toys.</i>

24:27.212 --> 24:31.046
<i>A gorilla mask, old baseball
cards, a piece of wood</i>

24:31.116 --> 24:33.414
given you in your youth
by that Kanine chap.

24:33.485 --> 24:35.248
Kaline! Al Kaline.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.686
<i>My role model, and one
of the greats of the game.</i>

24:37.756 --> 24:39.451
Game! Precisely.

24:39.724 --> 24:43.717
It's unnatural for an adult to attach
such importance to games and toys.

24:43.795 --> 24:46.889
<i>Oh, and toy bridges
are okay, and toy cannons,</i>

24:46.965 --> 24:50.128
and sexually maladjusted flowers
that you have to speak kindly to.

24:50.201 --> 24:53.659
<i>Those are acceptable mature baubles
for the mature, mature adult!</i>

25:08.119 --> 25:10.383
<i>Come on, Higgins,
enough is enough.</i>

25:10.922 --> 25:14.380
<i>Now, someone is going to help,
right? Or turn the power back on?</i>

25:15.160 --> 25:17.890
Double pressure from the same
side should prove more practical.

25:17.962 --> 25:19.827
<i>Come on, Higgins, answer me.
What are you up to?</i>

25:19.898 --> 25:21.593
What's your next
part of the plan?

25:27.105 --> 25:31.041
I'm only going to try to create
a leverage while you push.

25:31.109 --> 25:32.667
<i>Higgins, if you...</i>

25:32.877 --> 25:34.674
<i>If you are telling the truth,</i>

25:34.746 --> 25:36.714
we may end up having to
fight our way out of here.

25:36.781 --> 25:38.772
I don't want to do it
with a bent barrel.

25:38.850 --> 25:40.477
Only with a bent psyche.

25:41.386 --> 25:42.910
What does that mean?

25:42.987 --> 25:44.750
Simply that there
are so-called professions

25:44.823 --> 25:46.484
<i>that only 40-year-old
adolescents,</i>

25:46.558 --> 25:49.118
desperate to prove their
virility would practice.

25:52.630 --> 25:56.066
<i>Well, whatever I'm trying to prove,
at least I'm doing it in the present.</i>

25:56.134 --> 25:58.796
It beats living off the
laurels of an alleged past.

26:01.439 --> 26:02.770
Alleged past?

26:05.543 --> 26:07.704
Are you suggesting
that I lie about it?

26:08.880 --> 26:11.440
I am suggesting that some people

26:11.516 --> 26:14.280
<i>just don't have much of a
past, so they make one up.</i>

26:14.886 --> 26:17.855
Maybe even one so detailed
they can even believe it.

26:22.160 --> 26:25.425
<i>As soon as we get out of
here, I shall call Mr. Masters.</i>

26:26.364 --> 26:30.266
<i>At his discretion, one of us will
agree to leave Robin's Nest permanently.</i>

26:31.870 --> 26:35.271
<i>Well, we know there won't be much
question about his discretion.</i>

26:36.541 --> 26:38.406
But I'll agree anyway.

26:39.878 --> 26:42.813
<i>I'm telling you, they let the
whole thing get out of hand.</i>

26:43.548 --> 26:45.015
Look at this mess.

26:45.216 --> 26:47.081
Thomas is
definitely out of hand.

26:47.152 --> 26:50.679
We solve his case for him and he doesn't
even bother to show up to thank us.

26:50.755 --> 26:52.916
Which means he could be
in some kind of trouble.

26:52.991 --> 26:55.824
<i>Yeah, he sure is in trouble. Twelve
hundred and sixty bucks' worth.</i>

26:55.894 --> 26:58.727
Would you just forget about that
stuff until we find Thomas and Higgins?

26:58.796 --> 26:59.990
No. No!

27:00.498 --> 27:02.557
Why is it our job to find them?

27:02.634 --> 27:04.431
Why is it our job to do his job?

27:04.502 --> 27:06.333
Why am I out a camera and a disk

27:06.404 --> 27:08.099
that I never even got
a chance to use...

27:08.173 --> 27:09.902
<i>Hey, wait a minute.
Look at this.</i>

27:10.275 --> 27:12.266
Something serious at 4:00.

27:12.744 --> 27:14.712
Higgins doesn't misspell words.

27:17.715 --> 27:20.513
<i>Night-blooming cereus,
It's a flower.</i>

27:20.618 --> 27:23.052
<i>Yeah,
the flower that got beheaded.</i>

27:23.721 --> 27:27.020
There's no telling what Higgins
did after Thomas blew his bridge.

27:28.226 --> 27:29.887
3:30. Let's go.

27:31.029 --> 27:33.156
What are you doing?
It slipped.

27:33.231 --> 27:35.791
There's a chance that I
can induce more slippage.

27:35.867 --> 27:38.529
<i>No, the brakes are probably worn,
so they slipped a little bit.</i>

27:38.603 --> 27:40.468
But there's a safety.
You can't jar it loose.

27:40.538 --> 27:43.268
<i>And even if you could, do you wanna
free-fall two and a half floors?</i>

27:43.341 --> 27:46.708
<i>Rather than stay here indefinitely,
yes. I'll take the risk.</i>

27:46.778 --> 27:49.747
<i>No, Higgins, no. Come on,
stop, please. Just a minute.</i>

27:51.015 --> 27:52.573
<i>Now, no more games.</i>

27:52.817 --> 27:56.150
You didn't arrange this to
mess up my meeting with Nahli?

27:56.554 --> 27:59.717
<i>I mean, you weren't
maybe pretending to be him?</i>

27:59.791 --> 28:03.955
<i>On my honor, as an
Englishman, before the Crown,</i>

28:04.762 --> 28:06.957
I am not responsible.

28:25.183 --> 28:27.845
<i>Even as we may
shortly fall to our deaths,</i>

28:27.919 --> 28:30.444
you cannot forego the
opportunity to laugh at me.

28:30.521 --> 28:33.456
<i>Oh, come on. If I was doing the
jumping, you'd think I looked funny.</i>

28:33.524 --> 28:35.856
But I'd have
the decency not to laugh.

28:36.728 --> 28:39.720
This has nothing to do with
decency. You can't laugh.

28:41.666 --> 28:43.725
<i>You know, in all the time I've known you,</i>

28:43.801 --> 28:47.168
I have never actually seen you
have a great big belly laugh.

28:48.606 --> 28:52.838
People of proper breeding
do not belly-laugh.

28:54.345 --> 28:57.143
Fine. Don't offend your
breeding by jumping.

28:59.984 --> 29:02.316
Safety must be
locked down tight.

29:02.754 --> 29:05.985
It's somewhere
on top of the car.

29:07.425 --> 29:11.589
How is it that you're
so knowledgeable of lifts?

29:12.163 --> 29:14.324
Elevators. And don't tell me
I actually know

29:14.399 --> 29:16.128
more about something
than you do.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.464
Your indictment presumes
that I possess very little

29:18.536 --> 29:20.026
<i>first-hand knowledge
on any subject,</i>

29:20.104 --> 29:23.562
that I am a charlatan
who has fabricated his past.

29:25.877 --> 29:29.643
Not your entire past.
Nobody's that creative.

29:30.581 --> 29:33.243
You probably didn't
make up any of it.

29:34.485 --> 29:37.147
I've seen you in action.
That speaks for itself.

29:38.690 --> 29:41.625
Your accusation cannot
be retracted so easily.

29:43.061 --> 29:46.827
<i>Well, the same goes for you
calling me a 40-year-old adolescent.</i>

29:46.898 --> 29:50.334
<i>No, your accusation
is totally false.</i>

29:53.471 --> 29:56.668
<i>However, aside from your reasons
for pursuing investigative work,</i>

29:56.741 --> 29:58.675
I consider you to
be quite competent.

29:59.977 --> 30:02.571
<i>Thanks. Not extraordinary,
mind you, but competent.</i>

30:02.647 --> 30:04.877
<i>That's complimentary, when
you consider that I have known</i>

30:04.949 --> 30:07.315
the best Intelligence minds
in the world.

30:07.385 --> 30:11.048
Yes. So it says
in your memoirs.

30:12.223 --> 30:14.748
<i>Tell me something, Higgins,
is there anybody</i>

30:15.193 --> 30:17.923
<i>you haven't known, or
anything you haven't done?</i>

30:20.164 --> 30:22.394
You're calling me a liar again.

30:22.467 --> 30:25.095
I'm calling you an exaggerator.

30:25.770 --> 30:28.204
Your memoirs read
like a bad novel.

30:28.806 --> 30:33.004
<i>Not that it's bad writing.
No, it's kind of exciting,</i>

30:33.978 --> 30:36.276
<i>very imaginative,
very professional.</i>

30:36.347 --> 30:38.247
Not like that cheap pulp
that Robin writes.

30:38.316 --> 30:39.578
How dare you!

30:41.986 --> 30:43.647
I was just quoting you.

30:43.721 --> 30:46.417
You're the one who's always
referring to Robin's writing as cheap.

30:46.491 --> 30:50.052
I never said cheap. It's
just not serious writing.

30:50.128 --> 30:54.030
That's the only real difference
between the memoirs and the novels.

30:57.068 --> 31:01.266
The memoirs? The novels?

31:03.541 --> 31:07.978
<i>I was using the article "the" to compare
the works, rather than the writers.</i>

31:08.679 --> 31:09.737
Sure.

31:14.452 --> 31:16.716
<i>Just how much writing
have you done, Higgins?</i>

31:21.292 --> 31:25.695
<i>And so she says, "Ed, when are we
gonna get married? I feel dirty."</i>

31:28.199 --> 31:30.599
<i>Ed, over a beer tonight, okay?</i>

31:30.868 --> 31:32.460
We're late coming
back from lunch.

31:32.537 --> 31:34.334
<i>Check this place
one more time, okay?</i>

31:34.405 --> 31:35.667
One more time.

31:50.855 --> 31:54.313
<i>Yes, naturally, I've studied
the fundamentals of writing.</i>

31:55.493 --> 31:57.256
Professional writing?

32:15.012 --> 32:17.810
<i>Hey, Dave,
the power's still on in here.</i>

32:17.882 --> 32:20.043
<i>All right, that's it, Higgins.</i>

32:20.117 --> 32:22.210
No more games. I've had it!

32:29.894 --> 32:31.828
Why didn't you do
that before now?

32:31.963 --> 32:34.124
Because I didn't
want to waste a bullet.

32:34.198 --> 32:37.429
<i>If it is Nahli playing
the games, we may need it.</i>

32:37.502 --> 32:41.063
<i>Magnum, are you certain it was a
Mr. Bill Nahli you were to meet here?</i>

32:41.138 --> 32:42.264
A rat!

32:42.340 --> 32:44.774
I didn't ask for your
opinion of his character.

32:44.842 --> 32:47.675
Just tell me if you're sure that's
whom you were to meet. Nahli?

32:47.745 --> 32:49.212
N- A-H-L-I?

32:49.280 --> 32:51.748
Yes. And I just saw an R-A-T
that could eat Rhode Island.

32:53.251 --> 32:54.445
10-4.

32:55.820 --> 32:57.082
The power's off again.

32:57.154 --> 32:59.088
Some clown called
Island Power this morning

32:59.156 --> 33:00.384
and told them to cut it back on.

33:00.458 --> 33:03.018
<i>It's a big commitment,
this marriage stuff, Dave.</i>

33:03.094 --> 33:05.085
<i>If I marry Donna,
what about Sally?</i>

33:05.162 --> 33:08.154
What about this job?
Get busy.

33:08.332 --> 33:09.765
<i>All right, all right.</i>

33:12.737 --> 33:15.570
Forget it. I can't get out.
That escape's not legal size.

33:26.851 --> 33:29.376
You still haven't explained
your knowledge of lifts.

33:29.453 --> 33:30.977
And you still haven't explain...

33:34.158 --> 33:36.092
Explained why you're here.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.991
I still say you know
more than you're telling.

33:38.062 --> 33:41.031
<i>What happened, Higgins? Did
Nahli double-cross you, too?</i>

33:41.098 --> 33:43.066
I came to find my
stolen Ferrari.

33:43.134 --> 33:44.567
<i>Oh, that's it!</i>

33:46.003 --> 33:47.334
That sells it.

33:48.773 --> 33:50.138
Sells what?

33:50.508 --> 33:53.443
You said
your Ferrari. Again.

33:54.045 --> 33:56.445
<i>You have done that one
too many times, Higgins.</i>

33:56.514 --> 33:58.539
I meant Mr. Masters' Ferrari.

33:58.616 --> 34:00.516
<i>No, you didn't.
You do lie about yourself.</i>

34:00.585 --> 34:03.816
<i>It all adds up. The writing, the
little "my" slips of the tongue.</i>

34:03.921 --> 34:05.650
What one earth
are you talking about?

34:05.723 --> 34:08.283
<i>The big lie, Higgins.
Admit it. You're Robin.</i>

34:08.359 --> 34:09.985
You are Robin Masters.

34:18.668 --> 34:22.161
I'm laughing at the sheer
absurdity of the accusation.

34:22.239 --> 34:25.402
<i>No, no, no. You're laughing
because you're trapped.</i>

34:27.645 --> 34:30.909
You have never
laughed like this.

34:31.616 --> 34:34.915
<i>Now, admit it,
you spent all these years</i>

34:35.219 --> 34:38.085
<i>pretending to be
Robin's employee,</i>

34:38.589 --> 34:42.252
because you didn't want anyone to
know that you write cheap pulp novels.

34:43.360 --> 34:47.695
<i>And who, may I ask, is the man we
know and address as Robin Masters?</i>

34:48.099 --> 34:50.123
I don't know. Some little
guy with a voice like

34:50.201 --> 34:52.293
Orson Welles and
a body like Truman Capote

34:52.370 --> 34:54.702
that you hired to pose as Robin.

34:55.339 --> 34:57.364
That was very
interesting casting.

34:58.009 --> 35:00.239
<i>You weren't satisfied
with a nom de plume.</i>

35:00.311 --> 35:03.007
You developed this whole persona

35:03.080 --> 35:07.414
to create the kind of playboy
you envisioned writing cheap pulp

35:08.686 --> 35:12.520
so you could devote
yourself to serious writing.

35:12.590 --> 35:14.956
<i>Oh, please, I can't stand it.</i>

35:15.326 --> 35:18.386
<i>You can't stand the truth.
Oh, come on, please.</i>

35:18.462 --> 35:20.430
<i>I remember all
the little slip-ups,</i>

35:20.498 --> 35:22.489
like the time
Robin called you "sir."

35:23.234 --> 35:25.964
And why is it
that you know exactly

35:26.037 --> 35:29.200
<i>when he's going to call, and
exactly what he's going to say?</i>

35:29.273 --> 35:31.173
<i>I mean, why does
Jonathan Quayle Higgins</i>

35:31.242 --> 35:34.734
get these very legal looking letters
from Robin's publishing company?

35:37.882 --> 35:39.076
Well...

35:40.084 --> 35:44.748
Occasionally Mr. Masters asks me to
look over minor documents for him.

35:45.156 --> 35:49.183
<i>Minor documents? Checks, contracts,
approvals for galley sheets?</i>

35:49.260 --> 35:50.955
You steamed open my mail.
Ah-ha!

35:51.028 --> 35:52.962
Your mail!

36:05.042 --> 36:06.304
Demolition sirens?

36:10.548 --> 36:12.413
They're gonna
blow this place up.

36:14.285 --> 36:16.048
<i>If you didn't set this up
with Bill Nahli,</i>

36:16.120 --> 36:18.611
you still got to have some
idea what it's all about.

36:19.356 --> 36:20.414
Yes.

36:21.759 --> 36:23.488
<i>Cereus Mandevillus.</i>

36:29.932 --> 36:32.765
<i>Your attention, please.
This area is unsafe.</i>

36:32.835 --> 36:35.326
<i>You must clear the area and
move behind the barricades.</i>

36:35.404 --> 36:38.896
<i>I repeat, clear the area and
move behind the barricades.</i>

36:38.975 --> 36:41.307
We're here
because of your flowers?

36:41.944 --> 36:43.172
Perhaps.

36:43.346 --> 36:46.406
Because of the day-blooming
experiment. Mr. Obata...

36:53.055 --> 36:56.149
<i>All right, I've reconsidered
your free-fall theory.</i>

36:58.060 --> 36:59.425
Help me.

36:59.762 --> 37:02.560
We're safe for the moment. City
codes require that the alarms

37:02.632 --> 37:05.066
sound first 20 minutes
before the blast.

37:05.134 --> 37:06.965
They'll sound
again in five minutes.

37:07.036 --> 37:09.766
<i>Thanks. That's very reassuring.
Now, will you please jump?</i>

37:15.645 --> 37:18.409
And tell me why you think
Mr. Obata's mixed up in this.

37:18.481 --> 37:20.676
I believe he's arranged
for me to perish

37:20.750 --> 37:24.015
<i>rather than share the credit on
our Cereus Mandevillus project.</i>

37:24.086 --> 37:25.178
He sent you here?

37:25.254 --> 37:28.746
No. But I find it disconcerting
that he's Bill Nahli's uncle.

37:32.895 --> 37:34.294
His uncle?

37:34.664 --> 37:37.656
<i>Higgins, people don't
take flowers that seriously.</i>

37:38.901 --> 37:42.598
<i>Your friend, Mr. Obata, is
probably the big casino boss,</i>

37:42.672 --> 37:44.833
and he's been using
that cereus project

37:44.907 --> 37:47.501
as an excuse to hang
around and keep tabs on me.

37:47.577 --> 37:49.670
And he must've finally
found out that I was

37:49.745 --> 37:51.736
<i>onto his number two man,
his nephew.</i>

37:53.883 --> 37:55.214
<i>Well, I...</i>

37:56.319 --> 37:58.981
<i>I was very angry with you when
you took the car yesterday,</i>

37:59.055 --> 38:01.250
and I might have mentioned to Agatha and...

38:02.658 --> 38:04.387
And to Mr. Obata...

38:04.460 --> 38:07.088
That you were going
to have me arrested

38:07.163 --> 38:10.291
at some office while I was
investigating a gambling case.

38:10.366 --> 38:13.358
<i>If I leaked vital information,
it was an innocent error.</i>

38:13.436 --> 38:15.233
Like your coming
down here was innocent?

38:15.304 --> 38:19.070
<i>What, did Mr. Obata con you with some
great idea for getting back at me?</i>

38:19.909 --> 38:22.639
<i>My reason for being here is of
little importance at the moment,</i>

38:22.712 --> 38:25.442
and may have no consequence
at all in 15 minutes.

38:30.620 --> 38:32.485
<i>It's 12 minutes to four.</i>

38:32.555 --> 38:34.489
They might not
withstand the shock.

38:34.557 --> 38:36.650
<i>Agatha,
we've got to talk to you.</i>

38:36.959 --> 38:39.985
<i>We can talk,
but I can't open the door.</i>

38:40.162 --> 38:43.723
<i>The Cereus Mandevillus
must remain in total darkness</i>

38:43.799 --> 38:45.562
until just before the opening.

38:45.868 --> 38:47.301
Is Higgins in there with you?

38:47.370 --> 38:51.272
<i>No, I'm alone. Mr. Obata is
holding a press conference,</i>

38:51.340 --> 38:54.070
and Jonathan has
gone to assist Mr. Magnum.

38:54.143 --> 38:56.543
Assist? We thought
Thomas was here.

38:57.280 --> 39:00.909
<i>Yeah, to try and mess up those
flowers before Higgins can show them.</i>

39:01.350 --> 39:02.977
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

39:04.320 --> 39:06.083
The call was a trick?

39:07.290 --> 39:08.279
What call?

39:08.624 --> 39:11.923
The call that Jonathan
received from a man who told him

39:11.994 --> 39:15.054
that Mr. Magnum was in serious
difficulty and needed help.

39:15.131 --> 39:16.826
Did Higgins say
where he was going?

39:16.899 --> 39:20.062
<i>Yes, the Marine.
No... The Marina.</i>

39:20.169 --> 39:22.694
The Marina. The Yacht Club Marina. That's it!

39:22.772 --> 39:24.637
<i>They're gonna take the
King Kam Two out to sea,</i>

39:24.707 --> 39:26.470
and they're gonna settle
this fight once and for all.

39:26.542 --> 39:27.770
<i>Wait a minute, Rick.</i>

39:37.853 --> 39:40.788
<i>Oh, no, you can't bloom now!</i>

39:43.225 --> 39:44.624
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

39:44.694 --> 39:46.719
<i>You have five minutes
to clear the area.</i>

39:47.663 --> 39:50.496
<i>I repeat, you have five
minutes to detonation.</i>

39:52.935 --> 39:55.301
<i>It was a long shot,
but it finally came to me.</i>

39:55.371 --> 39:57.839
My uncle told me
on these elevators

39:57.907 --> 39:59.636
<i>where the escape hatch
was so small,</i>

39:59.709 --> 40:02.269
that the brakes were
probably in the floor.

40:02.345 --> 40:03.539
Your uncle?

40:03.612 --> 40:05.807
<i>Yeah, Uncle Otis. He used
to take me on repair jobs</i>

40:05.881 --> 40:07.712
with him when I was a kid.

40:08.551 --> 40:11.281
Your uncle was a lift
repairman and his name was Otis?

40:11.487 --> 40:14.650
<i>An elevator repairman,
and yes, his name was Otis,</i>

40:14.724 --> 40:16.817
<i>and if you put that in one of your
books, no one would believe it,</i>

40:16.892 --> 40:18.052
<i>would they, Robin?</i>

40:19.295 --> 40:22.093
<i>For God's sake, you're not
going to start that again?</i>

40:22.164 --> 40:24.689
We may have less
than five minutes to live.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.059
<i>So, we may not have another
chance to discuss it.</i>

40:27.136 --> 40:28.694
Confess. Wait.

40:28.771 --> 40:29.999
It's here.

40:45.254 --> 40:47.722
<i>This is the final
warning to clear the area.</i>

40:47.790 --> 40:49.621
<i>We are at one
minute and counting.</i>

40:49.692 --> 40:52.422
<i>I repeat, we have one minute to detonation.</i>

40:56.966 --> 40:58.558
Safety's frozen.

41:00.870 --> 41:02.098
It won't budge.

41:06.108 --> 41:08.440
<i>Come on, turn loose.</i>

41:12.415 --> 41:13.643
Got it!

41:26.295 --> 41:27.660
You okay?

41:28.397 --> 41:29.625
Yes.

41:31.567 --> 41:34.229
<i>Magnum, where did
you park the Ferrari?</i>

41:34.303 --> 41:37.272
Will you forget about the
car and worry about us?

41:37.840 --> 41:39.398
<i>All clear. We have a go.</i>

41:39.475 --> 41:41.238
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

41:41.310 --> 41:43.904
<i>eight, seven, six,</i>

41:44.146 --> 41:48.515
<i>five, four, three, two, one.</i>

42:27.156 --> 42:29.556
We had to check out
the Yacht Club Marina!

42:29.692 --> 42:31.284
I should never
have listened to you

42:31.360 --> 42:33.453
and that stupid
duel at sea theory!

42:34.230 --> 42:36.494
<i>We would have made it if we'd
have come here first, but no...</i>

42:36.565 --> 42:39.466
<i>Come on, will you? Just
come on! It's not my fault.</i>

42:39.735 --> 42:41.362
<i>I mean,
we couldn't have known...</i>

42:41.437 --> 42:42.665
You couldn't have known.

42:42.738 --> 42:44.433
We couldn't have
know that they...

42:59.955 --> 43:03.322
You couldn't have known we were
trapped inside if you'd gotten here.

43:11.500 --> 43:15.459
<i>Well, Mr. Masters' Ferrari
appears to be all right.</i>

43:23.812 --> 43:27.578
<i>The Cereus Mandevillus bloomed
briefly in the broom closet</i>

43:27.650 --> 43:30.949
<i>and then succumbed, without
the judges ever seeing them.</i>

43:31.854 --> 43:35.984
To think that Mr. Obata might
have murdered you for nothing.

43:36.525 --> 43:39.358
Flower lovers can
be pretty serious people.

43:42.965 --> 43:47.493
But of course Mr. Obata had far more
important things on his mind than flowers.

43:47.770 --> 43:50.568
He made a full confession
about the casino operation.

43:52.741 --> 43:54.572
Mr. Obata
arranged for my death

43:54.643 --> 43:57.407
out of a desperate need
for singular notoriety.

43:58.213 --> 44:01.671
But I could hardly expect that you
and I would agree on the matter.

44:06.221 --> 44:08.519
<i>Yes, well, I must be going.</i>

44:12.227 --> 44:13.956
<i>Bye, Agatha.
Bye.</i>

44:20.669 --> 44:22.261
<i>Okay, Higgins,</i>

44:22.338 --> 44:24.329
I'm here to get
something off my chest.

44:24.406 --> 44:27.898
<i>I did have an uncle who repaired
elevators, but his name wasn't Otis.</i>

44:29.712 --> 44:30.974
It was Tom.

44:36.719 --> 44:38.619
They're the wrong size.

44:41.557 --> 44:45.459
<i>Fortunately, so was your
Detroit Tiger costume.</i>

44:48.964 --> 44:51.489
It was too large
for any of the boys.

44:52.067 --> 44:55.434
Mrs. Hunter says that most of your
other donations were rejected as well.

44:56.438 --> 45:00.135
The complaints ranged from
antiquated to juvenile.

45:02.444 --> 45:05.072
Rick and T.C. Say you
only came to that building

45:05.147 --> 45:08.674
because you thought I was
in trouble. Is that true?

45:10.653 --> 45:13.747
I was obviously duped into
going by a bogus phone call.

45:14.757 --> 45:18.124
<i>You won't admit that you came
there to help me out, will you?</i>

45:18.193 --> 45:19.922
Just like you won't admit that you're Robin.

45:19.995 --> 45:22.964
<i>No, I won't listen to that
ridiculous theory again.</i>

45:23.032 --> 45:24.124
<i>Sure, Robin.</i>

45:24.199 --> 45:26.224
<i>And for your information,
Mr. Masters does ask me</i>

45:26.301 --> 45:28.599
to inspect all of
his important papers.

45:28.671 --> 45:31.970
Of course. Why not? Robin
should check out Robin's papers.

45:32.041 --> 45:34.874
<i>Anyway, I am going surf skiing for a while.</i>

45:34.943 --> 45:36.934
<i>Kids stuff, I know,
but I do enjoy it.</i>

45:37.012 --> 45:39.242
Have fun
rebuilding your toy bridge.

45:39.314 --> 45:41.407
The cement is out
of your toy cannon

45:42.151 --> 45:43.778
when you want to play with it.

45:50.092 --> 45:51.389
<i>Magnum,</i>

45:53.395 --> 45:55.295
<i>I, too, have a
confession to make.</i>

45:56.398 --> 45:59.856
<i>I did indeed want the last
trick, the last one-up.</i>

46:00.903 --> 46:04.066
<i>But, so goes the game.</i>

46:06.775 --> 46:08.402
<i>You're a good loser, Robin.</i>

47:00.662 --> 47:01.959
Higgins!
