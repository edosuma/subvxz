WEBVTT

00:06.299 --> 00:08.540
It is insanely gorgeous.

00:08.634 --> 00:09.794
So, buy it!

00:09.886 --> 00:11.126
It's also insanely expensive

00:11.220 --> 00:13.302
and, therefore, staying on
that side of the window.

00:13.389 --> 00:16.301
Bo, come on. Who deserves
it more than you, okay?

00:16.392 --> 00:17.507
You could go in there

00:17.602 --> 00:20.344
and you could charm the pencil
skirts off all those snooty clerks

00:20.438 --> 00:23.726
and snag that coat
for free, but you don't.

00:23.816 --> 00:26.193
Because there's things
I like better than stuff.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.322
Well, that depends.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.822
Does boinking your
ex make for a better life?

00:36.913 --> 00:38.824
What?

00:38.915 --> 00:41.531
--Oh.
--Bo, Kenzi. What a treat.

00:41.626 --> 00:43.708
--What up?
--Hi, Ciara, how are you?

00:43.794 --> 00:46.331
Great. You?

00:46.422 --> 00:48.128
--We're good.
--We're good.

00:48.216 --> 00:51.003
Oh, Bo, |-| never had a chance
to properly thank you for

00:51.093 --> 00:53.550
saving my life during that
whole body-snatch debacle.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.503
Oh, it's really not necessary.

00:55.598 --> 00:57.134
But it is.

00:57.225 --> 01:00.217
Can I treat you to lunch?

01:00.311 --> 01:01.141
[coughing]

01:01.229 --> 01:03.845
Oh. Oh, sorry.
Kenzi's not feeling so good--

01:03.940 --> 01:07.808
No. I'm sorry. I just had some
really bad salami and I think it...

01:09.528 --> 01:12.440
Some other time then.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.317
[KENZI] Bye.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.028
Okay, so you're not a saint.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.620
But did you really want
to have lunch with her?

01:18.704 --> 01:24.290
Totes. I mean, she'd probably eat
somewhere expensive and pay for it.

01:24.377 --> 01:27.039
But, hey, if my bestie's got
problems with her, then forget it--

01:27.129 --> 01:29.211
I don't have problems with her.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.675
| just don't really feel
like hanging out with her.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.919
She's not my friend.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.844
Do | not know what
the word "problems" means?

01:36.931 --> 01:39.172
--Ow!
--Let's go.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.475
[BO] Ow!

01:43.562 --> 01:44.972
[KENZI] That's for the arm.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.645
Excuse me.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.447
Rusty! Shooter girls just got here,
you don't want to miss them.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.617
Sweet party, bro.

01:59.704 --> 02:02.195
It's just the warm-up.
Wait 'til we hit lbiza.

02:03.541 --> 02:06.624
Oh my god, your room is amazing.

02:06.711 --> 02:09.373
No, you are.

02:13.843 --> 02:16.175
Give me this. Oh.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.648
Okay. Okay, Okay.

02:31.736 --> 02:34.648
Don't move a muscle.

02:38.034 --> 02:40.275
I got a bit of a selection for you here.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.746
Got ribbed for her pleasure.

02:42.830 --> 02:49.201
Ah, something in a leopard print,
maybe or cherry flavour.

02:49.295 --> 02:50.751
Cherries.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.375
[gurgling]

02:58.429 --> 03:00.135
Guy?

03:08.773 --> 03:11.685
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:11.776 --> 03:14.688
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:14.779 --> 03:17.691
My love carries a death sentence.

03:17.782 --> 03:19.864
l was lost for years,

03:19.950 --> 03:22.612
searching, while hiding,

03:22.703 --> 03:26.867
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:26.957 --> 03:31.826
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.840
[HALE] Absolutely, sir.

03:41.931 --> 03:46.140
Yeah, we were all over it.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.809
Okay. You got it.

03:50.398 --> 03:54.562
Oh, Chief's on our asses, he's telling
me the killer left a signed confession.

03:54.652 --> 03:58.065
Yeah, sure. It's in that box of Cubans.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.656
I got me some bad
déja vu about this.

03:59.740 --> 04:04.484
Third body, two weeks,
a lot of commonalities.

04:04.578 --> 04:08.662
All vics 20-something,
killed at home, wealthy,

04:08.749 --> 04:12.708
asphyxiation, crushed
bones, internal bleeding.

04:12.795 --> 04:14.501
Is that girl worth a look?

04:14.588 --> 04:15.873
As a suspect? Nah.

04:15.965 --> 04:18.251
Ain't no way she did it,
she's half his weight.

04:18.342 --> 04:20.924
Fifty percent of that is champagne.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.638
Hey, look, man,

04:29.728 --> 04:33.141
this is starting to smell funny
to me and I'm not even a wolf.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.938
It's definitely Fae.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.401
A Fae serial killer?

04:36.485 --> 04:38.646
Murdering humans
and getting real sloppy.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.398
Yeah. He's not even feeding on them.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.105
We need to make a connection fast.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.577
Well, lucky for us,

04:45.661 --> 04:48.573
Cam scheduled his
every waking moment.

04:48.664 --> 04:52.828
Hell of a life, too. Wall-to-wall
parties in Rio, Dubai, Paris.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.954
He's got a few in town this week, too.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.661
Thought maybe we
could get some intel.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.964
Yeah, well, those parties
are going to be serious A-list.

05:01.051 --> 05:04.384
We can't crash them 'cause we've
already been made at the scenes.

05:04.472 --> 05:07.054
"We" weren't who I was thinking of.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.467
The parties are insane, ladies.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.553
One word--hot tubs.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.729
That's two words, dinkus.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.431
Okay, okay, okay.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.563
Hot tubs filled with Cristal.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.905
Oh, those are five really good words.

05:21.989 --> 05:22.978
Uh huh.

05:23.073 --> 05:26.986
They cater with celebrity chefs.
Fly D.J.s in from all around the world.

05:27.077 --> 05:31.491
Oyster bars, vodka tastings. Ah?

05:31.582 --> 05:34.449
Swag bags worth more than my car.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.920
I'm going to marry these
parties is what I'm going to do.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.165
Well, it does sound like fun
and we could always use a little fun.

05:39.256 --> 05:43.169
We could. And a clothing allowance.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.761
But don't these people
all know each other?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.301
How do you figure we fit in?

05:46.388 --> 05:48.253
Well, we've got to send
you to prep school.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.055
Hook you up with someone to talk to.

05:50.142 --> 05:53.054
You know, someone who is dialled
in to the young money crowd.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.808
Okay. Sounds good. Who?

06:01.987 --> 06:03.568
You know, you don't have time for this.

06:03.656 --> 06:06.318
Bo, I will make time to help you.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.201
A guest list for the
party you're going to.

06:11.288 --> 06:15.452
Fully notated with advice
and juicy detail on each guest.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.704
Oh, also...

06:17.795 --> 06:19.001
...you should try this on.

06:19.088 --> 06:23.001
Oh, no. That's okay,
|'m--|'m, I'm dressed.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.707
Humour me.

06:24.802 --> 06:28.010
--One in her size, please.
--[STORE CLERK] Mhm.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.303
Who's this guy?

06:29.390 --> 06:32.678
Russell Cooper. He's the host.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.430
"Derek Hurst. Ask about a boat."

06:35.521 --> 06:38.308
True sailor. Lives and dies by the wind.

06:38.399 --> 06:43.564
Act interested and he'll nearly
insist on being your boyfriend.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.736
"Ian Morton. Don't ask about a boat."

06:45.823 --> 06:47.108
Well, technically, it was his father's,

06:47.199 --> 06:50.157
but, um, technicalities don't
matter at the bottom of a lake.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.951
"Lita S. Play up your
interest in fashion"?

06:53.038 --> 06:56.622
She does accessories. Very exclusive.

06:56.709 --> 06:57.994
You know, come to think about
it, there was some chatter

06:58.085 --> 06:59.746
about her and the first victim.

06:59.837 --> 07:02.123
She's gorgeous, single,

07:02.214 --> 07:04.421
and she spent a lot of time
on a custom piece for him.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.090
People thought they were
knocking custom boots?

07:08.512 --> 07:11.504
Could you just take a few
minutes and try this on?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.765
|--| just love this
window into your world.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.720
And Dyson's. He can
be so impenetrable.

07:18.814 --> 07:23.433
Plus, every time I offer to buy
him a dress, he turns me down.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.858
Okay. I will try it.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.687
But I can't let you buy it for me, okay?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.898
Nonsense. |t's-lt's for Dyson's work.

07:30.993 --> 07:34.952
And, you know, sorry to go on about him,
it's just you know him so well and |--

07:35.039 --> 07:37.826
[BO] I can't hear you.
The dress is over my head.

07:56.852 --> 08:00.595
Oh, no thank you, but the
canapés look charming, Russell.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.021
Well, someone gave me the
name of a charming caterer.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.609
You're welcome. Oh...

08:04.693 --> 08:06.433
I brought you a little gift

08:06.528 --> 08:09.656
'cause the host is always
the most important decoration.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.114
It's a signature Lita S belt.

08:13.202 --> 08:14.817
Because what is it | always say?

08:14.912 --> 08:18.450
Handmade artisanal items set
a man apart in a prefab world.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.871
Mhm. Oh, yes, thank you.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.290
I'm going to put it
on right now... for battle.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.249
Oh, hi.

08:30.344 --> 08:34.758
Okay. I say just start with the whiskey
bar, the raw bar, and then gift bags.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.555
Or, you know, gift bags, desserts,
vodka tasting, whatever.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.099
But we need a strategy pronto.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.847
Yeah, to investigate.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.805
I did not go shopping with
Princess Grace just for the makeover.

08:43.899 --> 08:48.518
Yes, but Lita S is here somewhere.
What if there's a free boot bar?

08:48.612 --> 08:50.227
I'm sorry. Do |--

08:50.322 --> 08:52.563
You must be Russell. Hi.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.114
And you are?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.362
l, um...

08:56.453 --> 09:00.241
I am very pleased to introduce
you to my friend, Ken--Kimmy.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.539
Thank you, Bitsy.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.582
Hi. We live upstairs.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.159
That right?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.077
Mhm, yeah. We saw
you were having a do,

09:07.172 --> 09:10.790
thought we would come
and say, you know, halla!

09:10.884 --> 09:12.670
Or et cetera.

09:12.761 --> 09:16.629
You look a little more downtown
than my other neighbours.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.931
Well, aren't you charming, darling.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.975
Nothing hotter than a girl who's
a little dirty around the edges.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.477
You want a tour?

09:24.565 --> 09:26.430
Oh, she'd love one.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.481
Yes.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.732
Got a bar fridge in each bathroom,
fully stocked with snacks.

09:31.822 --> 09:35.030
'Cause that's the best place to eat food.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.733
I knew that I liked you. I knew it.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.249
Thank you.

09:51.175 --> 09:54.292
Have we met?

09:54.386 --> 09:57.093
Placing faces isn't my forte.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.763
You know, I wish someone
would invent an app for that.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.556
I'd buy it.

10:01.643 --> 10:05.181
I'm Clive. Or as my friends
would call me, C3PO.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.433
Human-cyborg relations.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.809
Clive it is.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.812
So, are you friends with Russell?

10:10.903 --> 10:12.313
Yeah, I like to think I am.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.441
He, um, invested in
my software company.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.319
Oh, so that's how you guys are
able to have this much fun, huh,

10:18.410 --> 10:19.616
you're tech guys.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.409
Yeah, a few of us.

10:21.497 --> 10:23.738
Speaking of tech, do you
want to see something cute?

10:23.832 --> 10:25.743
Yeah, I'd love to.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.951
My brother just sent me photos
of my new niece, Steven Arianna.

10:29.046 --> 10:32.129
After the original genius,
of course. Steve Jobs.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.547
Right.

10:33.634 --> 10:37.502
My brother's the dork in the family.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.507
Ah. Cute baby.

10:39.598 --> 10:40.462
l'm Lita.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.969
Oh, Lita S, I heard you'd be here.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.516
Oh, wow. I'm flattered.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.015
And I am in the market, actually,

10:47.105 --> 10:50.347
for a truly special pair of boots
for my very best girlfriend.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.852
Oh, I wish I could help,

10:51.944 --> 10:55.061
but I don't really have any
lines for women anymore.

10:55.155 --> 10:59.740
But if you have any men you'd
like me to dress, let me know.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.034
l was telling someone
about this beautiful cover,

11:02.120 --> 11:04.827
how it warms the chill
technology spreads.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.496
May |?

11:09.711 --> 11:13.078
So, Clive, did you know Cam Ferguson?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.916
I did. I was--| was at
the party that night.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.002
You know, I just don't
really want to talk about it.

11:20.097 --> 11:23.430
Apologies. |-| need to excuse myself.

11:30.816 --> 11:34.684
And that's howl made
my first mil. No bigs.

11:34.778 --> 11:40.444
So, um, Cameron, the dead guy,
were you his business partner?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.195
He was like a brother to me.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.652
I can't believe that he's gone.

11:46.874 --> 11:51.538
Hey, you ever seen Isabella's
Book of Artistic Nudes?

11:51.628 --> 11:54.210
Gosh, mister, no.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.539
--|'ll show you.
--Okay.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.969
That box, Balinese.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.551
I love Balinesia.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.183
Hey, is this--is this by Lita S?

12:12.274 --> 12:13.605
I heard she was going
to be here tonight.

12:13.692 --> 12:17.526
She's a good, good friend.
She actually made me this belt.

12:17.613 --> 12:18.568
Wow.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.644
You want to meet her?

12:19.740 --> 12:20.980
If you insist.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.939
Yeah, and if you can please
arrange, like, a one-on-one,

12:23.035 --> 12:24.900
that would be so cool.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.576
What are you doing?

12:40.010 --> 12:44.754
Dude, did you roofie me
up the side of my head?

12:44.848 --> 12:46.429
Ow.

12:47.893 --> 12:51.806
That was a creepy way
to cop a feel, man.

12:57.069 --> 13:00.277
Oh my god. Oh, man.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.820
Whoa!

13:01.907 --> 13:03.317
Oh, great.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.571
Just what every girl needs,
a matching set of dead guys.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.695
Dude, aren't you dead?

13:09.790 --> 13:12.372
No. No, are you?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.575
No.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.786
No, but...

13:16.880 --> 13:20.293
Oh, but he is.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.999
Oh! Oh!

13:34.815 --> 13:36.680
You wanted to see me.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.151
Do you know what this is, Doctor?

13:41.238 --> 13:42.227
A Peri?

13:42.322 --> 13:45.280
It's an endangered Fae
of ancient Persian origin.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.823
Yes, I know.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.827
Such exquisite little creatures,

13:50.914 --> 13:53.997
until they begin to swarm, then they
become more like killer bees.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.666
Bees with the voices of angels.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.414
I know what a Peri is, Ash.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.872
I did an autopsy on one
for you a few weeks ago.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.673
What, this?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.261
Well, you asked for a quick turnaround.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.758
On a full autopsy, which
I want you to do now.

14:08.849 --> 14:13.138
I'm having a hard time, personally.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.470
l have new evidence about
what happened with Nadia.

14:16.565 --> 14:20.854
Well, I want you to do the
report again, correctly.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.730
Now off you go.

14:28.994 --> 14:31.155
I'm running low on patience.

14:31.246 --> 14:35.205
And I got hit on the head,
Sergeant Hard-Ass.

14:36.626 --> 14:40.494
Haven't you ever heard
of victim's rights?

14:40.589 --> 14:42.625
Your Sunday paper?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.297
Your rap sheet.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.968
Or a rap sheet for some of you.

14:48.055 --> 14:53.516
Kenzi Williams, Kenzi McAdams,
Kenzi Rogers. Also Rhino Levine,

14:53.602 --> 14:57.186
Ninotchka Alexandrovich,
Toni Soprano.

14:57.272 --> 15:00.139
Oh yeah, that last one
was a boondoggle.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.270
But it wasn't my fault.
Big mix-up at the passport office.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.942
Try again.

15:06.782 --> 15:10.821
Mine was a troubled youth, Officer.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.151
I'm sorry.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.955
The orphanage and then I became
a governess for a Mr. Rochester who--

15:17.042 --> 15:20.534
Listen, l have a holding cell
and a dead guy.

15:20.629 --> 15:24.497
I also have a mouthy
girl with quite the record.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.627
You want to do the math?

15:30.514 --> 15:32.675
Hey, Chief needs to see you, Rossy.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.012
Yeah.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.970
Thanks for softening this
one up for me, though.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.476
Oh, thank Hale.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.061
I got you, little mama.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.647
But just try to give me
something to tell them.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.607
What did you see
before you got K.O.'d?

15:52.702 --> 15:55.990
Some privileged mo-fo trying
to impress me out of my girdle.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.287
Uh huh.

15:57.374 --> 16:03.495
Um... a desk, Persian rug,
books of artistic nudes.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.169
What else?

16:05.257 --> 16:07.669
A wooden box, Balinese.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.045
--Did you look in it?
--Yeah.

16:10.137 --> 16:15.131
Um, sticky notes,
paper clips, cough drops.

16:15.225 --> 16:19.184
And a-a business
card holder by Lita S.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.353
Good job.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.020
Ahh.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.612
All right. All right. All right.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.065
I don't like dead people.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.168
Do you want some?

16:49.259 --> 16:51.750
I'm not really that hungry.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.301
Thank you.

16:54.973 --> 17:00.843
I'm Maganda. It means,
"pretty of the forest."

17:00.937 --> 17:08.355
Oh, I'm Bo. It means... well, Bo.

17:08.445 --> 17:11.278
Are you, um, are you here
as a witness for the murder?

17:11.364 --> 17:15.482
| witness all from beneath a tree.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.533
You live in the park?

17:17.621 --> 17:20.909
No. My... my home is lost.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.206
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.953
You know, I'm not going to have
much to tell them when it's my turn.

17:28.048 --> 17:31.006
Did you see something?

17:31.092 --> 17:36.928
Moon of silver. Owl seeking God.

17:37.015 --> 17:41.099
Snake with the face of lady.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.347
Beautiful face.

17:43.438 --> 17:47.602
Long, dark silk down her back.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.899
Miss, you're up.

18:02.374 --> 18:03.830
Wow.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.247
How's Clive doing?
Is he going to be okay?

18:08.338 --> 18:11.580
Yeah. Though he got
it worse than Kenzi.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.212
Well, maybe the killer is
more determined to hurt guys.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.883
Maybe.

18:15.971 --> 18:18.178
Take a look at this.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.598
It's a floorplan to the victim's place.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.051
Kenzi and the vic
were here in the office.

18:24.145 --> 18:27.637
Clive comes down the
hallway to use the bathroom.

18:27.732 --> 18:28.892
Where are you?

18:28.984 --> 18:30.690
I am in the kitchen
trying to pretend

18:30.777 --> 18:34.144
I'm not dressed like Succubus Barbie.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.571
It is a different look for you.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.149
Ciara picked it out.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.700
You look nice.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.246
So, where is Lita at this point?

18:48.336 --> 18:49.496
Lita who?

18:49.587 --> 18:50.872
Lita S.

18:50.964 --> 18:55.048
She's some kind of designer,
lifestyle consultant, something.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.376
As far as I can tell,
she's been at every party.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.176
She's not on my witness list.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.380
But your squad cars
got there within minutes.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.556
And she's not the kind of girl
that can walk away unnoticed.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.554
She probably blended right in.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.432
Anyway, no one noticed
anything out of the ordinary.

19:09.983 --> 19:13.692
Actually, somebody did.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.483
You think Lita's Fae?

19:17.574 --> 19:20.486
Maybe. Maybe some
kind of snake shifter.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.660
All the products Lita makes
are real snakeskin--wallets, shoes--

19:23.747 --> 19:26.910
So, she uses her own
dead skin to make her stuff?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.116
It's very green of her.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.702
Well, Kenzi saw a snakeskin case
on Russell's desk before he died.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.085
And one of the other vics
had snakeskin shoes.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.461
I think you need to talk to her again.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.417
Oh, no. I am not her type.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.128
Except in a snake toying
with a mouse kind of way.

19:42.223 --> 19:45.090
She really likes guys.

19:45.185 --> 19:49.178
Handsome guys with
more money than brains.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.183
Are you saying that
I fit that description?

19:51.274 --> 19:53.014
Well, you got the handsome part down.

19:53.109 --> 19:56.021
So, what? I go undercover,
act moneyed?

19:56.112 --> 19:57.977
Yes. And you bring Bo.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.314
What? What? Who does what?

20:00.408 --> 20:03.946
Lita's a predator. She'll love
chasing him with you right there.

20:04.037 --> 20:07.325
Well, l have met her, so I guess
I could say Dyson's my brother.

20:07.415 --> 20:10.623
Go with fiancé and bring out her fangs.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.086
That's not a great idea.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.455
I mean, we've done it before.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.753
It's just things were
pretty different then.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.583
I know. But we're all friends
now, three of us, right?

20:22.847 --> 20:24.633
All right. Let's do it.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.479
Are you sure?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.064
I trust you.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.530
Poor Wendell is so smart
when it comes to finance.

20:42.617 --> 20:46.735
But all he ever wears is this
exact same suit every single day.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.070
You have twenty versions.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.871
Darling, please.
I also have my golf shirts...

20:50.959 --> 20:52.915
...which I wear for golf.

20:53.002 --> 20:56.085
Wendell? Adorable.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.914
May | just...

20:59.008 --> 21:04.128
Oh, yes, your fiancé didn't mention
how handsome you were.

21:04.222 --> 21:08.215
What I want to do is bring out
the natural man from within you.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.721
There's a wild animal
in there somewhere.

21:10.812 --> 21:14.225
Oh, yes, there is.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.567
| sat on a few boards
with Russell Cooper.

21:16.651 --> 21:20.564
He always looked impeccable
and I know that that was due to you.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.191
You knew Russell?

21:25.618 --> 21:28.735
Oh, how awful. I have just
remembered something.

21:28.830 --> 21:32.322
lam double-booked and I need to run.

21:32.417 --> 21:36.160
But we came all this way.
Are you trying to lose customers?

21:36.254 --> 21:38.210
We know you're Fae, Lita.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.263
Dyson . Dyson .

21:46.347 --> 21:48.724
I'm okay. I'm okay. Go, go, go!

21:48.808 --> 21:50.139
Okay.

22:07.076 --> 22:09.032
--My home! Don't touch, don't...
--|'m so sorry. Are you okay?

22:09.120 --> 22:10.576
--I got her.
--...touch!

22:14.792 --> 22:16.248
Okay.

22:18.296 --> 22:20.287
You spit on the wrong guy.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.303
The Ash's guards have
her sedated, heavily.

22:32.393 --> 22:33.382
She's in the dungeon.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.969
That was an impressive
tackle you made back there.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.897
What can I say, I'm a snake charmer.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.484
Find anything yet?

22:40.568 --> 22:44.356
Just that you can make a killing
selling handmade snakeskin items.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.443
Oh, wait. Cancel that.
| just found something.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.741
Something good?

22:49.827 --> 22:51.408
A client list.

22:51.496 --> 22:55.364
And our last victim is on it.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.245
Yeah, so is the one before that.

22:58.336 --> 23:00.998
Wait, wait, wait, go back, go back.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.580
Heinze? It can't be.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.290
Who's Heinze?

23:05.385 --> 23:09.424
He's a Kobold. Ex-Navy, retired.

23:09.514 --> 23:11.675
Definitely not Lita's type.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.389
Hey.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.724
Thanks for agreeing to meet, Clive.

23:22.819 --> 23:26.858
I'm Detective Hale.
And you might remember Kenzi?

23:26.948 --> 23:28.609
We got our heads bashed in together.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.406
We're practically engaged.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.700
Yeah, but I thought you were Kimmy.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.903
That's my middle name.

23:34.998 --> 23:36.579
She's got a few of those.

23:36.666 --> 23:40.079
I'm going to need to
ask you about Lita S.

23:40.169 --> 23:43.252
|... | see her at
parties all the time.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.920
Has she ever threatened any of you?

23:45.008 --> 23:47.044
No, never.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.295
Everyone always wants her around.

23:48.386 --> 23:51.173
She's like having a
mirror ball at your party.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.925
See? Look.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.603
I guess I'm a little in love with her.

24:02.317 --> 24:05.980
But now Russell's dead.

24:06.070 --> 24:10.063
And Cam and Neal.

24:10.158 --> 24:11.648
What if I'm next?

24:11.743 --> 24:13.233
Oh, dude. Buck up.

24:13.328 --> 24:19.119
She's locked up and you're safe,
or my name isn't Kenzi Kimmy.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.664
ReaHy?

24:22.670 --> 24:25.002
Okay.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.956
Sure, I know Lita. What a lady.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.884
Wouldn't mind her walking
my plank, if you know what I mean.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.585
Were you a client, Heinze?

24:32.680 --> 24:35.137
Oh, I don't live up in that air, honey.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.966
Want to buy something nice
for your girlfriend here, Dyson?

24:38.061 --> 24:41.599
I've got these ivory bangles
from darkest Africa.

24:41.689 --> 24:46.524
She's my colleague, not to
mention the global ban on ivory.

24:46.611 --> 24:50.354
Just joking you. They're plastic.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.484
She asked you a question.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.657
How I knew Lita?

24:54.744 --> 24:59.033
Used to sail stuff around
the world for people.

24:59.123 --> 25:04.038
Now | sell the stuff myself, exotic
goods, sent from the four corners.

25:04.128 --> 25:07.040
Handicrafts, Miss Lita calls them.

25:07.131 --> 25:12.171
Sends lots of her clients to
me for things that are unique.

25:12.261 --> 25:16.504
Humans, those poor sods are
always looking to buy things

25:16.599 --> 25:18.510
that make them feel special.

25:18.601 --> 25:19.807
Well, what does she get out of it?

25:19.894 --> 25:22.601
She gets a wee cut of my sales.

25:22.689 --> 25:28.434
Also a steady supply of rats
from the ships for her snacks.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.440
I'm a trustworthy guy, eh Tricksy?

25:31.531 --> 25:35.740
Unless a Kobald is bound to you, don't
leave any of your stuff lying around.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.863
That's not fair now.

25:37.954 --> 25:40.286
Okay, we don't care about any of that.

25:40.373 --> 25:43.331
We just care about
some recent human deaths.

25:43.418 --> 25:44.908
Take a look at these.

25:47.797 --> 25:50.504
Never seen them.

25:50.591 --> 25:54.175
These boys were killed by
Fae hands, probably Lita's.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.298
Would you look at the time?

25:56.389 --> 25:59.301
I've got an antique show to set up for.

25:59.392 --> 26:04.932
You'd be surprised at the old stuff
you can talk humans into buying.

26:12.655 --> 26:17.365
Okay, I know Kobalds are shifty,
but that was over the top.

26:17.452 --> 26:18.862
Just me?

26:18.953 --> 26:22.366
[cell phone ringing]

26:22.457 --> 26:24.743
Dyson .

26:24.834 --> 26:26.825
I'm on my way.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.420
The snake is awake.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.537
It's time to play.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.713
Were you angry when you killed them?

26:35.803 --> 26:38.920
No. I loved them and their credit cards.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.175
Then why did you run?

26:40.266 --> 26:42.848
I thought you were going
to bust me for selling my skin.

26:42.935 --> 26:46.644
Yeah. Shedding your Fae
D.N.A. all over the human world.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.221
The Ash didn't like hearing that.

26:48.316 --> 26:49.806
The Ash can bite me.

26:49.901 --> 26:52.062
Are humans going and getting
their boots and shoes tested now

26:52.153 --> 26:54.986
to see if they contain Fae D.N.A.?

26:55.072 --> 26:57.028
Please, they can barely do them up.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.949
One last time!
Why did you kill them?

27:00.036 --> 27:02.368
I didn't.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.707
You expect us to believe a snake?

27:07.794 --> 27:10.831
I'm innocent.

27:10.922 --> 27:12.958
You're going to do that
in the Ash's house?

27:13.049 --> 27:15.381
I don't think so. Put them away.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.174
Put them away!

27:21.933 --> 27:24.424
Danger. Ciara at one o'clock.

27:24.519 --> 27:25.975
--Hi.
--Do you want to fake food poisoning?

27:26.062 --> 27:27.347
Let's go with the chicken wings.

27:27.438 --> 27:30.726
You know what, I'm actually
kind of starting to like her.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.523
Okay. You need to get laid.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.067
Ha, ha, ha. But not by Dyson.

27:35.154 --> 27:39.318
Dyson and l are done.
Like, done-done. We are so done.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.616
But he obviously has
great taste in women.

27:42.703 --> 27:47.288
And Ciara's--she's
smart and, and funny.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.491
And she's ballsy.

27:49.585 --> 27:53.123
Oh my god, isn't she just so perfect?

27:53.214 --> 27:56.377
Why don't we just blow up an air
mattress and invite her to move in?

27:56.467 --> 27:58.173
You are jealous.

27:58.261 --> 28:01.469
--Who's jealous?
--Nobody at this table.

28:01.556 --> 28:06.971
Obviously, we're all way,
way super-uber mature. So...

28:08.479 --> 28:09.855
Did you hear they got Lita?

28:09.939 --> 28:11.429
Yeah. I came to buy
you some champagne

28:11.524 --> 28:13.731
but you don't sound too enthusiastic.

28:13.818 --> 28:16.810
Bubbly? Are you kidding me?
She's ecstatic.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.485
I'll get the champers.

28:21.492 --> 28:24.359
Trick says that Lita is a Mama Wata.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.613
A snake Fae.

28:25.705 --> 28:28.822
I knew one once and they do
tend to like expensive trinkets.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.407
Right. Here's my question--

28:31.502 --> 28:34.118
the guys were all crushed
to death, strangled.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.421
But when confronted, Lita spat poison.

28:37.508 --> 28:40.170
Right. That's the way a
Mama Wata would operate.

28:40.261 --> 28:43.753
It's not a python,
it's a poisonous snake.

28:45.099 --> 28:49.638
Okay. I christen thee
the good ship Drunkypop.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.560
Don't pop the cork yet.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.512
We have the wrong Fae.

28:59.447 --> 29:04.407
[cell phone ringing]

29:07.246 --> 29:08.702
--Hello?
--Clive, you got to watch out.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.120
--Kimmy? Whoa, whoa.
--Just watch your back, okay?

29:10.207 --> 29:13.870
--Slow down.
--We got the wrong Fae, man.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.701
[screaming]

29:15.796 --> 29:17.582
Clive?

29:17.673 --> 29:19.129
Clive!

29:20.635 --> 29:22.421
Clive, are you there?

29:33.272 --> 29:35.854
We tracked the G.P.S. on his phone.

29:37.652 --> 29:39.108
He's dead.

29:40.154 --> 29:43.612
Same kind of kill. No witnesses.

29:43.699 --> 29:47.112
His computer tablet was smashed
and his body was crushed.

29:47.203 --> 29:51.037
Dude, dude, keep the gory
details to your gory self.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.540
The poor little nerdnik.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.333
He was a sweet guy.

29:56.420 --> 30:00.709
Yeah. And now I'm starting
to feel like the black widow.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.337
You meet me at a party
and then bam, you're cooked.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.918
It is not your fault, Kenz, okay?

30:06.013 --> 30:08.254
There is someone out
there who has lost it.

30:08.349 --> 30:10.135
And we had the wrong suspect.

30:10.226 --> 30:12.137
Yeah. About that,

30:12.228 --> 30:15.595
Fae Sherlock Holmes and
Fae Watson, what the hell?

30:19.694 --> 30:24.188
You wouldn't know quality if you
fell off a frigate and drowned in it.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.737
Yes.

30:29.161 --> 30:34.246
Ladies, my goodness, look at us.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.915
Evening, Heinze. Need anything?

30:37.003 --> 30:40.336
No, I'm just having a chat
with these fine ladies.

30:40.423 --> 30:42.334
Try it out, Eulalie.

30:42.425 --> 30:45.007
I know you're not soliciting
in my establishment.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.756
--Would I do such a thing?
--Yes.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.554
--How much?
--Eighty-nine ninety-eight.

30:50.641 --> 30:54.759
What? The wood is from Bali.
l have to recoup my costs somehow.

30:54.854 --> 30:57.436
Would that be endangered
wood from Bali?

30:57.523 --> 30:59.104
--Out, Heinze.
--Trick,

30:59.191 --> 31:03.560
I've got a lot of stuff I got
to sell and fast. Please.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.519
Off the stool, 'Lalie, it's leaving.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.697
But it's so comfy, my bottom
feels like it's come home.

31:08.784 --> 31:12.868
See? |t's quality stuff.
You want to try too, Trick.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.662
Do you want a cut? I can do that.

31:21.422 --> 31:23.754
Gute nacht, Heinze!

31:30.139 --> 31:33.802
You want a four-poster bed,
a cutting board,

31:33.893 --> 31:34.973
you know who to call.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.642
Out!

31:39.398 --> 31:41.889
Someone is killing
tiny, endangered Fae.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.896
Harmless, defenceless Fae.

31:44.987 --> 31:45.976
[LAUREN] I believe so.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.653
And based on the evidence
that you provided,

31:47.740 --> 31:51.733
we have at least three
Peri deaths by electrocution.

31:51.827 --> 31:55.194
--Doesn't make sense.
--I agree.

31:55.289 --> 31:56.620
And l have a theory.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.163
Oh, yes?

31:59.502 --> 32:02.084
But I need your help first.

32:05.382 --> 32:06.883
With this.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.883
Cursing nail, African.

32:12.973 --> 32:16.636
And l have reason to believe
that it's related to Nadia's state.

32:16.727 --> 32:19.013
l have to get her out of that coma.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.345
You think she's cursed.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.020
It fits.

32:24.401 --> 32:27.734
I've done everything that
you've ever asked of me.

32:27.822 --> 32:31.155
I think that l have earned
the right to ask one thing of you.

32:31.242 --> 32:32.322
Surely, there's something that you--

32:32.409 --> 32:36.527
I wasn't the Ash when she
was cursed, if indeed she is.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.782
I can't help you.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.488
But you're the Ash now.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.494
And you have all of
the power of the Ash.

32:41.585 --> 32:44.998
Just grant me top-level clearance
for research and documents.

32:45.089 --> 32:47.831
The old Ash kept journals religiously.

32:47.925 --> 32:49.381
No.

32:51.512 --> 32:53.218
I cannot go on like this.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.843
You can and you will come back
when you've composed yourself.

32:56.934 --> 32:58.390
No.

33:01.772 --> 33:03.433
Because nothing is worth this life.

33:03.524 --> 33:07.517
I will not be your servant anymore.
I will take Nadia and we will leave.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.943
And how on earth will
you manage that?

33:12.616 --> 33:15.608
No, please. Please, please!

33:15.703 --> 33:18.615
Please, Ash, I beg you, please!

33:18.706 --> 33:22.198
Please, Ash, please...

33:29.592 --> 33:33.176
Do we have the old Ash's
journals in archive?

33:33.262 --> 33:35.002
Bring them to me.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.010
Being on Lita's client list
is still a risk factor.

33:43.105 --> 33:47.189
All those boys dress the same, play at
the same places, like the same things.

33:47.276 --> 33:48.607
It's not enough of a connection.

33:48.694 --> 33:52.061
I'm telling you, what if I met the first
two victims and I didn't even know it?

33:52.156 --> 33:53.646
I keep popping up.

33:53.741 --> 33:56.608
You're being crazy, but
someone keeps popping up.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.444
The crazy homeless lady?

33:59.538 --> 34:01.153
We picked her up in
the park near Russell's.

34:01.248 --> 34:02.237
Maganda.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.745
She was there when we
chased Lita out of her office.

34:04.835 --> 34:08.043
Those locations are close. Coincidence?

34:08.130 --> 34:10.086
I didn't think the popo
believed in those.

34:10.174 --> 34:11.789
We don't.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.670
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.179
Bo, what was in her cart?

34:19.266 --> 34:22.383
Ah, random stuff.
You know, a lot of tchotchkes.

34:22.478 --> 34:26.016
Salad bowls, wooden trays, mens'
jewellery boxes, that kind of stuff.

34:26.106 --> 34:29.519
Um, the box from
Russell's desk is gone.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.817
What?

34:31.904 --> 34:35.021
She took it? That's what she wanted?

34:35.115 --> 34:38.448
Trick, you got any ideas about this?

34:38.535 --> 34:39.661
She's a Batibat.

34:39.745 --> 34:40.734
A whaty-what?

34:40.829 --> 34:45.493
Each of them belongs to one tree
and one tree belongs to them.

34:45.584 --> 34:46.869
They're generally peaceful.

34:46.961 --> 34:49.828
The problem starts when
you cut down a Batibat's tree.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.254
Every sliver is a part of them.

34:52.341 --> 34:54.297
They won't let any of it go.

34:54.385 --> 34:56.797
To the point where
they'll kill to get it back.

34:56.887 --> 34:59.094
Their rings are their
history, their diary.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.923
Someone, and I think
I might know who,

35:02.017 --> 35:06.306
took the Batibat's tree and it got made
into the items your victims owned.

35:06.397 --> 35:09.480
The wood feels good.
It feels like home.

35:09.566 --> 35:13.309
So, she was compelled to
kill them to reclaim her home.

35:13.404 --> 35:18.865
Like a mother seeking a lost child,
it's instinctual, primal, almost animal.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.816
And she needs every piece back.

35:20.911 --> 35:25.621
Um, great. Wicked, guys,
but what is she looking for here?

35:32.923 --> 35:34.129
Stay calm.

35:34.216 --> 35:37.253
Hey. We're here to help.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.721
Maganda.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.761
We know it's been you all along.

35:45.394 --> 35:46.304
[ClARA] She'll crush him!

35:46.395 --> 35:47.475
[HALE whistling]

35:47.563 --> 35:50.350
Won't work. She's lived
with birdsong all her life.

35:54.403 --> 35:55.483
[ClARA] Sorry.

35:55.571 --> 35:56.560
[BO] Good one, though.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.565
[HALE] Stay with us, D.

35:57.656 --> 35:58.691
What here is hers?

35:58.782 --> 36:01.068
Heinze was trying to sell
wooden things. He was desperate.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.866
He was trafficking her wood.

36:02.953 --> 36:04.033
He had to dump it all.

36:04.121 --> 36:05.281
He was limping.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.749
--His cane!
--[DYSON] Can't breathe!
--[C|ARA] Hold on, Dyson, hold on.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.414
[HALE] Push, man, push!

36:10.544 --> 36:13.331
Maganda, look what I got.

36:13.422 --> 36:14.878
Huh?

36:17.676 --> 36:19.212
Bo! My vault.

36:19.303 --> 36:22.636
[BO] Come on. Here,
Maganda. Come on.

36:22.723 --> 36:25.510
That's it. That's it.

36:25.601 --> 36:29.014
Come on, tree-hugger, come with me.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.364
We got to get Heinze
and the rest of her wood.

36:42.451 --> 36:43.907
Fast.

36:45.496 --> 36:48.613
[MAGANDA] That tree is mine. Mine.

36:48.707 --> 36:52.416
Well, she's certainly a rather
focused individual. That's admirable.

36:52.503 --> 36:54.664
[MAGANDA] Open this door!

36:56.632 --> 36:58.714
Thought you'd try to run, Heinze?

36:58.801 --> 37:00.883
I don't know what
you're trying to pull here.

37:00.969 --> 37:05.008
l was off to the Bahamas.
You can't just abduct a guy.

37:06.475 --> 37:10.559
[howling]

37:10.646 --> 37:12.853
Oh, no.

37:12.940 --> 37:14.180
Oh, yeah.

37:14.274 --> 37:15.980
You took her tree, Heinze.
What'd you expect?

37:16.068 --> 37:20.528
|-| didn't know. I didn't
know it was a Batibat's wood.

37:20.614 --> 37:23.481
Well, now you're going to tell me
you left your cane by accident, too?

37:23.575 --> 37:27.443
I didn't want any more boys to die.
I figured you'd know what to do.

37:27.538 --> 37:30.075
Bah! You're saving your own skin.

37:30.165 --> 37:32.201
Maganda. We have someone here.

37:32.292 --> 37:35.125
The man that bought
your tree from the poachers.

37:35.212 --> 37:37.624
We know he had it cut up and
made into things he was selling.

37:37.714 --> 37:38.840
He's going to get it all back for you.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.165
What? No, wait.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.297
That's impossible.
I sold most of it already.

37:44.388 --> 37:48.051
Hundreds of items.
People won't give it back for free.

37:48.142 --> 37:50.849
Like I said, you're going
to get it all back for her.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.144
It'll take months. The cost will ruin me.

37:54.231 --> 37:57.223
What about what's
happened to her? Huh?

37:57.317 --> 38:00.684
What about what's happened to
the guys who bought stuff from you?

38:03.115 --> 38:06.278
Maganda, it's going to take
a little bit of time, but he'll do it.

38:06.368 --> 38:09.235
You just have to stay in
custody while he does, okay?

38:09.329 --> 38:11.820
Yes. Yes.

38:23.760 --> 38:27.548
Hundreds of years, my tree,

38:27.639 --> 38:33.635
waltzing with the clouds,
waving to the rain.

38:33.729 --> 38:38.393
Every leaf grew in my heart.

38:40.194 --> 38:43.402
It was my home.

38:43.489 --> 38:46.606
It was my hearth.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.942
It was a castle for my grandchildren.

38:51.705 --> 38:53.741
And now it's gone.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.701
I'm so sorry.

38:58.795 --> 39:03.539
It won't be the same,
but your tree will be yours again.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.126
Oh...

39:07.221 --> 39:11.214
...no, that's okay. I don't need a hug.

39:15.979 --> 39:17.935
Looks great.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.230
Fits you like a glove.

39:20.317 --> 39:23.400
And sadly, I don't have a rich
hipster party to wear it to tonight.

39:23.487 --> 39:25.569
Oh, well, me neither.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.902
Do you have a minute?

39:29.993 --> 39:31.654
For you, always.

39:34.164 --> 39:38.908
Ciara, you're smart
and you're genuine.

39:39.002 --> 39:43.245
And you have an awesome
swing with a fireplace poker.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.046
Well, I try.

39:45.133 --> 39:50.594
But you also seem kind
of lonely and kind of hurt.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.006
Am I that obvious?

39:54.101 --> 39:56.057
Look, I don't want to
talk about your boyfriend.

39:56.144 --> 40:00.888
And I can't claim to understand
him now, if I ever did.

40:00.983 --> 40:04.225
But if you wanted to
make me your friend,

40:04.319 --> 40:06.105
you succeeded.

40:07.656 --> 40:10.773
You deserve to be happy.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.448
Thank you.

40:13.954 --> 40:16.115
Talk to Dyson.

40:16.206 --> 40:17.867
Be direct.

40:20.002 --> 40:21.663
I'll see you around.

40:33.265 --> 40:34.721
Hey, beautiful.

40:40.022 --> 40:43.059
This looks like trouble.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.765
That depends.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.943
Will you sit with me?

40:49.031 --> 40:50.487
Of course.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.531
I'm good with trouble.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.959
I'm mad about you, Dyson.

41:04.046 --> 41:07.254
Wild, crazy, mad about you.

41:07.341 --> 41:09.878
| feel as though I've
waited lifetimes for this.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.924
l have, actually.

41:12.012 --> 41:12.842
Ciara--

41:12.929 --> 41:17.923
Just remember how
long I've known you.

41:18.018 --> 41:20.885
I won't be easy to fool.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.356
And I don't want to be a fool.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.476
I don't want to stay
and clutch at something

41:25.567 --> 41:27.683
that will simply never be there.

41:29.488 --> 41:34.278
So, I need to know
will you love me back?

41:43.669 --> 41:46.877
I will give you everything that I can.

41:50.550 --> 41:53.383
Do my very best to make you happy.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.261
You already do.

42:22.624 --> 42:24.660
She looks so happy.

42:24.751 --> 42:26.457
Yes, she does.

42:26.545 --> 42:30.584
We'll keep her here until Heinze does
his duty and the police case cools down.

42:30.674 --> 42:32.460
Might take a number of years.

42:32.551 --> 42:34.792
Well, she did murder humans.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.968
She has to pay for it in some way.

42:38.306 --> 42:41.514
Eventually, we'll ship her back
to the jungle with all her goods.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.557
Thank you, Lachlan.

42:43.645 --> 42:45.476
I really appreciate it.

42:45.564 --> 42:46.849
Not at all.

42:46.940 --> 42:48.350
If the Light Fae are happy,
then I'm happy.

42:52.112 --> 42:55.104
Okay. Sure.

42:56.658 --> 42:59.821
I'd do anything to protect our people.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.947
Great.

43:02.038 --> 43:03.824
Now I trust you know
your way back upstairs.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.746
I've got a few little things to do.

43:05.834 --> 43:07.290
Yeah.

43:08.587 --> 43:10.123
Thanks again.

43:22.267 --> 43:24.599
Lachlan, please.

43:27.022 --> 43:31.015
Lachlan! Please!

43:31.109 --> 43:33.600
Please, I beg you. Please!
