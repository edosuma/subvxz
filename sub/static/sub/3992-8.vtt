WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:03.095
Previously on Hannibal..

00:03.130 --> 00:05.223
- You wanted me to embrace
my nature, Doctor.

00:05.270 --> 00:08.159
- Are you going to try to hurt
Hannibal again? Is he safe?

00:08.200 --> 00:09.701
- From me? Or for you?

00:09.740 --> 00:12.379
I'd like to resume my therapy.
- Where shall we begin?

00:12.410 --> 00:15.470
- I'm gonna prove Hannibal
Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper.
- It's not him.

00:15.510 --> 00:18.638
- I could hear his voice.
I could not see his face.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.819
- You will not see it
until it is too late.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.613
- You can't trust her, Jack.

00:22.650 --> 00:25.312
You can't trust any of this
to be what it seems.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.564
- I get it. The great outdoors.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.592
I get the attraction.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.201
In summer.
(laughing)

00:45.210 --> 00:47.770
- Well... it's a lot
harder to catch trout

00:47.810 --> 00:50.370
when the water
IS really cold.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.810
- That's another argument
for summer, Will.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.478
But trout are supposed
to be hunters.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.546
Like, they should be
chewing on my hook here.
- Yeah, when it's cold,

00:58.590 --> 01:01.650
their metabolisms drop
and they're not as hungry.

01:01.690 --> 01:05.581
- Yeah, so how do you catch
a fish that isn't hungry?

01:05.630 --> 01:09.088
- Change your tactics.
Use live bait

01:09.130 --> 01:12.588
that moves and
excites them to action.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.235
You--you gotta make him bite
even though he's not hungry.

01:16.270 --> 01:18.465
- Make him act on instinct.

01:18.510 --> 01:20.535
He's always a predator.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.346
- You have to create a reality
where only you and
the fish exist.

01:24.380 --> 01:27.269
Your lure is
the one thing

01:27.320 --> 01:31.381
he wants, despite
everything he knows.
- Make a wrong move,

01:31.420 --> 01:35.208
he swims away?
- Yeah.

01:35.260 --> 01:38.627
I'm a good fisherman, Jack.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.696
- You hook him,

01:40.730 --> 01:43.665
I'll land him.

01:43.700 --> 01:46.567
(classical music)

02:33.620 --> 02:36.248
- Truite saumone au bleu

02:36.290 --> 02:38.645
with vegetables and broth,

02:38.690 --> 02:40.749
served

02:40.790 --> 02:43.679
with a hollandaise sauce
on the side.

02:45.330 --> 02:46.729
Beautiful
fish, Will.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.321
- It was my turn
to provide the meat.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.293
- More flavorful and firm

02:55.340 --> 02:57.706
than farmed specimens.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.732
I find the trout to be
a very Nietzschean fish.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.907
Trials of his wild existence

03:02.950 --> 03:05.248
find their way into
the flavor of the flesh.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.384
I hope "providing the meat"
doesn't mean you still
harbor doubts

03:13.420 --> 03:15.411
about what I serve
at my table.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.928
- No doubts, Dr. Lecter.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.292
Only the, uh... wounds

03:20.330 --> 03:21.991
we dealt
each other

03:22.030 --> 03:24.794
until we got to the truth.
- Which is why

03:24.830 --> 03:28.869
we need to move past
apologies and forgiveness.

03:28.900 --> 03:32.438
Chilton has many victims
besides the dead.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.005
We will absorb this experience.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.645
It will change us.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.547
Well, we are all Nietzschean
fish in that regard.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.411
- Makes us tastier.

03:42.450 --> 03:45.248
- None of our actions
were personal.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.258
- I tried to have
Hannibal killed.

03:47.290 --> 03:50.384
Isn't that personal?
- You thought I was a killer.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.593
The greatest crime now
would be to walk away

03:53.630 --> 03:56.622
from what we've shared
and suffered.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.797
In many ways, we need each
other. We are the only ones

03:58.830 --> 04:01.492
who will know
what this feels like.

04:01.540 --> 04:04.930
- This fish is delicious.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.972
- Isn't it?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.911
- I came in this morning
and I found

04:16.950 --> 04:18.918
all the horses with hoods on.

04:18.950 --> 04:21.054
She was lying dead in her stall.

04:21.090 --> 04:23.786
- She had a foal two days ago?

04:23.830 --> 04:26.298
- Yeah, born dead.
She hasn't eaten since,

04:26.330 --> 04:28.321
pining I guess.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.607
- Feels like
she's still pregnant.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.619
Did they check
for twins?

04:50.590 --> 04:52.888
Who performed this C-section?

04:52.920 --> 04:55.753
- She didn't have a C-section.
Those weren't there yesterday.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.779
- Yeah, there's something
in here all right...

05:36.430 --> 05:39.729
***

06:02.020 --> 06:03.988
- I agree
with the pagans.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.986
The horse is divine.

06:06.030 --> 06:08.919
All beasts of burden
are sacred animals.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.099
- This kind
of mutilation

06:11.130 --> 06:14.588
usually presents
as cult activity.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.564
- When an animal is sacrificed,
it's presumed the power

06:17.610 --> 06:19.578
of the beast will be
psychically transported

06:19.610 --> 06:22.078
to whoever's
offering up the goods.

06:22.110 --> 06:25.170
- Which is why sacrificial
animals should be healthy,

06:25.210 --> 06:27.576
without any defects.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.509
This horse was sick.
- The womb was more or less

06:30.550 --> 06:34.088
intact. The victim was deceased
before she was enwombed.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.954
The ecchymosis of the
subcutaneous tissue
is consistent with--

06:37.990 --> 06:40.652
- She was strangled.
That's a little wordy.

06:42.130 --> 06:44.462
- Yeah...

06:44.500 --> 06:47.389
She was scrappy.
She put up a fight, Jack.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.902
- The horse is a chrysalis,

06:50.940 --> 06:54.137
a cocoon meant to hold
the young woman until her death

06:54.180 --> 06:56.478
could be transformed.
- Transformed into what?

06:56.510 --> 07:00.048
- Life. A new life.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.686
This is a birth.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.087
Or it was intended to be.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.749
This is every bit as much about
giving life as it is taking it.

07:10.790 --> 07:13.020
- What's the thinking here,
Doctor?

07:13.060 --> 07:15.028
- Conflicted.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.164
I see what he's done.
I don't understand

07:17.200 --> 07:19.737
why he's done it.

07:19.770 --> 07:23.160
This killer doesn't think
like anyone else, Jack.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.804
You'll have to find someone who
doesn't think like anyone else

07:25.840 --> 07:29.469
to catch him.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.111
- Ah!

07:37.120 --> 07:39.486
- You should have taken
the chocolate, Margot.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.827
- You are no more at fault
for what happened to you

08:24.870 --> 08:28.237
than if you had been
bitten by a mad dog.

08:28.270 --> 08:30.659
- Mad dogs are put down.

08:30.710 --> 08:34.578
- Is that what you hoped to
accomplish when you attacked
your brother?

08:34.610 --> 08:36.646
- Well,
apparently,

08:36.680 --> 08:39.274
I went about "putting
him down" the wrong way.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.108
He's still alive.

08:42.150 --> 08:44.710
- Doing bad things to bad people

08:44.750 --> 08:46.718
makes us feel good.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.716
What's your relationship
with him now?

08:48.760 --> 08:50.728
Has it changed?

08:50.760 --> 08:54.321
- I think he thinks
I've calmed down.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.328
- Have you?

08:56.360 --> 08:58.726
- Oh, I'm calm.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.833
- Are you going to try again?

09:05.210 --> 09:07.201
(snickering)

09:08.980 --> 09:11.869
- This is where therapy
gets a little tricky.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.912
- It doesn't have
to be tricky.

09:17.020 --> 09:19.011
- I could confess
to a murder.

09:19.050 --> 09:21.018
You can't
say a word.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.255
I could've murdered
someone this morning

09:23.290 --> 09:25.884
and you can't say a word.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.319
But if I'm planning
to commit a murder...

09:28.360 --> 09:32.296
- I am ethically obliged to take
action to prevent that murder.

09:32.330 --> 09:36.130
But be that as it may,
if there's no one else
to protect you, Margot,

09:36.170 --> 09:38.309
you have to
protect yourself.

09:38.340 --> 09:41.935
It would actually have been
more therapeutic if
you had killed him.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.209
- I'm not complaining, but part
of me suspects we ended up here

10:47.240 --> 10:49.777
to avoid where _
our conversation was gomg.

10:51.780 --> 10:54.169
- As long as you're
not complaining.

10:54.220 --> 10:58.042
- Too much has happened for us
not to talk about this.

10:58.090 --> 11:01.309
However pleasant
the distractions. _
- Well, I am recovering

11:01.360 --> 11:04.784
from all that has happened.
So is Will.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.091
So are you.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.196
I would change many things,

11:15.240 --> 11:17.936
but not that we ended up here.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.837
Or that Will is back in therapy.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.109
- The only thing stranger
than finding a woman

11:27.150 --> 11:29.118
inside a horse...

11:29.150 --> 11:32.347
is seeing you back in therapy
with Will Graham.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.151
- Is it really so strange?

11:38.190 --> 11:40.192
- He tried to murder you.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.261
- Do you know why
Will tried to kill me?

11:48.300 --> 11:51.007
It wasn't to avenge
Beverly Katz's death.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.031
It was to prevent yours.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.816
He was protecting you
in the only way he felt
he had left to him.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.988
- I'm afraid Will opened
a door inside himself

12:10.030 --> 12:12.919
and no one knows
If It closed again.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.258
Especially not Will.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.326
- Then it's healthy
he's back in therapy.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.007
With a good psychiatrist.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.488
- Her name is Sarah Craber.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.216
She was a horse groom
at the stables where
her body was found.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.855
She was reported
missing last week.
- Got a hand-spread on her neck.

12:43.890 --> 12:47.053
We didn't find anything else
on her, except horse uterus.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.059
- The uterus isn't always such
a safe, forgiving environment.

12:51.100 --> 12:54.160
Shark fetuses cannibalize
each other in utero.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.498
And chances are very good
everybody in this room

12:56.540 --> 12:59.134
abs_orbed a_ twin.
MIne surVIved.

12:59.170 --> 13:02.105
- Her throat's obstructed.
Do you wanna...
- Yep.

13:02.140 --> 13:05.348
- It's soil... _Someone
packed It In there

13:05.380 --> 13:07.371
real good too. It's not
even on her teeth.

13:08.620 --> 13:11.111
Oh!

13:11.150 --> 13:12.959
- You dropped it.
I'll get it.

13:12.990 --> 13:14.912
- Thanks.
- I'll test the pH levels,

13:14.960 --> 13:16.882
see what kind
of organic matter

13:16.930 --> 13:18.852
or trace elements
we come up With.

13:18.890 --> 13:20.994
Should be able to figure out
where it came from.

13:22.130 --> 13:24.860
She has a heartbeat.
- What?

13:24.900 --> 13:28.392
- She's in rigor mortis--
- She doesn't have a pulse.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.998
- She has a heartbeat.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.065
- She doesn't--

13:32.110 --> 13:34.431
She has a heartbeat.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.114
- Something's beating.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.537
(screeching)

14:15.380 --> 14:17.917
(chirping)

15:11.470 --> 15:14.405
- I don't want you to see me.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.671
I don't want you
to see what I do.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.678
But I want to calm you,

15:19.710 --> 15:21.678
comfort you.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.439
There's so much comfort
In darkness.

15:27.620 --> 15:31.329
But not for one of you.

15:54.580 --> 15:57.743
I took your life...

15:57.790 --> 16:00.418
and tried to give it
back to you.

16:04.090 --> 16:06.422
I find the womb,

16:06.460 --> 16:08.724
and place you inside.

16:17.340 --> 16:20.229
I hope that the forces

16:20.280 --> 16:24.444
of death and biology...

16:24.480 --> 16:28.348
will bring you... rebirth.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.456
It was a coffin birth.

16:40.530 --> 16:43.328
Decomposition
builds up gasses

16:43.370 --> 16:46.396
inside
the putrefying body

16:46.430 --> 16:49.433
which force the dead fetus
out of its mother's corpse.

16:49.470 --> 16:51.734
It's really more
of a prolapse than a birth.

16:51.770 --> 16:55.274
But whoever did this
knew the horse.

16:55.310 --> 16:58.074
Knew she was dying
because her foal

16:58.110 --> 17:01.341
was born dead.

17:01.380 --> 17:04.816
He knew Sarah Craber.

17:04.850 --> 17:08.286
He was familiar
with the stables. He knew
when he wouldn't get caught.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.288
And he works
here, or maybe--

17:10.330 --> 17:12.286
maybe used
to work here.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.628
He has medical
knowledge of animals,

17:14.660 --> 17:16.821
but he's not
a veterinarian.

17:16.860 --> 17:19.727
He--he considers
himself a healer.

17:19.770 --> 17:22.830
- How is this healing?

17:22.870 --> 17:25.259
- Sarah Craber
was reborn.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.430
This wasn't
murder, Jack.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.301
This was grief.

17:57.910 --> 18:02.370
(loud knock)
(barking, screeching)

18:05.650 --> 18:08.744
- Scare them when
ya knock like that.
- Peter Bernardone?

18:15.720 --> 18:18.518
Sir?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.166
You don't seem to be curious
about who we are.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.208
- Who are you?

18:33.240 --> 18:35.504
- I'm Agent Jack Crawford

18:35.540 --> 18:37.701
with the FBI.
This is Will Graham.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.776
We're here to ask you
some questions about someone

18:40.820 --> 18:42.742
you may have had contact with
when you worked

18:42.780 --> 18:46.409
at the Blackbriar Stables.
A woman named Sarah Craber.

18:46.450 --> 18:49.180
Her body was
recently found

18:49.220 --> 18:52.451
in, uh... unusual circumstances.
- I know.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.856
I know. I heard.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.266
- There was a bird in her chest.
Did you hear about that?

18:57.300 --> 19:00.269
- Was the bird alive?

19:02.670 --> 19:04.308
- Yes.

19:07.210 --> 19:10.179
- Who--who--who
taking care of the bird?

19:10.210 --> 19:14.169
- How well did you
know Sarah Craber?
- I didn't know her.

19:16.950 --> 19:18.918
- Would you mind looking
at a photograph?

19:18.950 --> 19:21.680
_ 1--

19:21.720 --> 19:24.188
I--I know who she is.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.721
I didn't--didn't know her.

19:30.830 --> 19:33.628
- Just...

19:33.670 --> 19:35.661
take a look to be sure.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.468
- Did you get your head injury
when you were working
at the stables, Peter?

20:09.500 --> 20:13.379
- Yeah, okay. Kicked
by a horse. Boom.

20:13.410 --> 20:15.275
- That's an atypical
motor response.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.248
Peter's abilities
to look and touch

20:19.280 --> 20:21.339
can only happen
as separate events.

20:21.380 --> 20:24.918
It's aggravated
by stress, right?

20:27.460 --> 20:29.678
- Are you feeling
under stress?

20:29.720 --> 20:31.688
- Yeah, I'm worried
about the bird.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.994
Worried about the bird.

20:34.030 --> 20:37.397
I'm sad for her death,
sad for the horse, but I...

20:37.430 --> 20:39.864
I can only--

20:39.900 --> 20:42.460
only help the bird.

20:47.840 --> 20:51.469
- Well, he knew the victim.
He knew the animals involved.

20:51.510 --> 20:54.411
- We'll need a warrant.

20:54.450 --> 20:57.419
- I don't know if
he's the killer, Jack.

20:57.450 --> 21:00.715
If he is, he never meant
to be. And if he isn't,

21:00.760 --> 21:03.581
he knows who is.

21:07.030 --> 21:08.998
- You were able to reconstruct

21:09.030 --> 21:11.464
this killer's fantasies.

21:11.500 --> 21:15.038
One dead creature
giving birth to another.

21:15.070 --> 21:18.528
The bird, his victim's
new beating heart.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.801
Her soul given wings.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.799
- Rebirths can only
ever be symbolic.

21:25.850 --> 21:28.717
- You've been reborn.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.310
- Wasn't that the goal
of my therapy?

21:35.790 --> 21:39.089
- How does it feel consulting
again with Jack Crawford
and the FBI?

21:39.130 --> 21:41.951
Last time, it nearly
destroyed you.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.060
- Last time, you
nearly destroyed me.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.468
- After everything
that has happened, Will,

21:49.500 --> 21:51.468
you still believe--
- Stop right there.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.775
You may have to pretend,

21:54.810 --> 21:56.801
but I don't.

21:58.810 --> 22:01.040
- No, you don't.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.048
Not with me.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.538
- I don't expect you
to admit anything. You can't.

22:08.820 --> 22:11.129
But I prefer sins of omission

22:11.160 --> 22:13.628
to outright lies, Dr. Lecter.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.288
Don't lie to me.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.434
- Will you return the courtesy?

22:28.080 --> 22:31.447
Why have you resumed
your therapy?

22:31.480 --> 22:33.414
- Can't just talk
to any psychiatrist

22:37.750 --> 22:39.741
- Do you fantasize
about killing me?

22:41.860 --> 22:43.851
- Yes.

22:46.430 --> 22:48.591
- Tell me. How would you do it?

22:51.700 --> 22:53.691
- With my hands.

22:55.700 --> 22:59.158
- Then we haven't moved past
apologies and forgiveness,
have we?

22:59.210 --> 23:02.099
- We've moved past
a lot of things.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.075
I discovered a truth
about myself

23:07.110 --> 23:09.374
when I tried to have you killed.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.910
- That doing bad things to bad
people makes you feel good?

23:17.120 --> 23:19.122
- Yes.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.792
- I need to know if you're going
to try to kill me again, Will.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.038
- I don't want to kill you
anymore, Dr. Lecter.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.641
Not now that I finally
find you interesting.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.921
- Will...

24:26.960 --> 24:29.895
I owe you an apology.

24:29.930 --> 24:31.966
- You don't owe me anything.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.888
- I thought
you were a killer.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.636
I didn't want to hear
anything else.

24:36.670 --> 24:39.468
So, I wouldn't consider
anything else.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.147
- The evidence was compelling.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.774
- That didn't stop Beverly
from questioning it.

24:46.810 --> 24:49.745
Maybe if she thought
we would've listened,

24:49.780 --> 24:52.089
she would have come to us.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.111
She didn't.

25:00.730 --> 25:03.995
- We traced the soil we found
in Sarah Craber's throat

25:04.030 --> 25:07.591
to this vicinity.
Methane probes did the rest.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.699
Found her empty grave...

25:09.740 --> 25:11.833
and fifteen others that are not

25:11.870 --> 25:14.236
so empty.
- If Peter Bernardone

25:14.280 --> 25:17.238
knew about Sarah Craber's grave,
then he knew about
all the others.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.318
- Every human being is capable

25:28.360 --> 25:30.658
of committing acts
of great cruelty.

25:30.690 --> 25:32.658
Your brother
dis-humanized you,

25:32.690 --> 25:35.693
and your family unfortunately
fosters that climate

25:35.730 --> 25:38.119
of disrespect.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.161
- They think I'm weird.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.832
- I'm much weirder than
you Will ever be, Margot.

25:44.870 --> 25:46.861
It's fine to be weird.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.879
- They've already
forgiven him.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.644
Talk shows and self-help books,

25:57.690 --> 25:59.715
they thrive on
this sort of thing.

25:59.750 --> 26:02.958
Everybody loves
a sinner redeemed.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.691
The prodigal son, set about
repairing his ways.

26:08.730 --> 26:11.267
He may have made
bad choices before,

26:11.300 --> 26:14.269
but now he can make
new, better ch0ices.

26:14.300 --> 26:18.009
- Do you believe that?

26:18.040 --> 26:21.203
- Do you believe me?
- Well, it's not my role
to believe you, Margot;

26:21.240 --> 26:24.300
it's my role to help you
understand what you believe.

26:24.350 --> 26:27.672
- I believe my brother
won't stop.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.917
- How does it make you feel?

26:33.250 --> 26:35.150
- Angry.

26:35.190 --> 26:37.215
- Anger is an
energizing emotion;

26:37.260 --> 26:40.354
prompts action against threat.
If you're angry,

26:40.390 --> 26:42.858
you're optimistic you can
stop this from happening again.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.925
- Oh, I know
how to stop it.

26:46.930 --> 26:49.865
- If you really want
to kill your brother, Margot,

26:49.900 --> 26:53.233
wait until you can
get away with it.

26:53.270 --> 26:55.909
Or find someone
to do it for you.

26:58.810 --> 27:01.278
- You said you were worried
about the bird.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.311
Thought you might
like to see it.

27:06.820 --> 27:08.879
- But isn't--

27:08.920 --> 27:11.059
isn't it the evidence?

27:11.090 --> 27:13.991
- I'm not FBI.

27:14.030 --> 27:17.158
I used to sort of be FBI.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.862
But now I'm really not.

27:19.900 --> 27:22.892
- I--I didn't--

27:22.940 --> 27:25.738
didn't ki||--ki|| anyone. I--
- I know that,

27:25.770 --> 27:29.331
but...

27:29.380 --> 27:31.803
it's not always relevant.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.810
They found Sarah Craber's grave.

27:36.850 --> 27:38.909
How'd you find it?

27:45.890 --> 27:49.724
- She--she's already
speaking to me.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.778
At some point,

28:01.810 --> 28:04.005
almost every society
believed birds

28:04.050 --> 28:07.304
carried our souls
to the afterlife.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.309
- You--you think I think

28:12.350 --> 28:15.478
this bird is--is Sarah?

28:15.520 --> 28:19.024
She's gone.

28:19.060 --> 28:21.358
She's everywhere and nowhere.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.425
She...

28:23.460 --> 28:27.066
- Tell me who killed her.

28:34.310 --> 28:37.370
- I just wanted something
beautiful for her.

28:37.410 --> 28:40.277
- You were grieving her.

28:40.310 --> 28:43.916
You couldn't save her,

28:43.950 --> 28:46.339
but you could bring

28:46.390 --> 28:48.358
poetry to her death.

28:48.390 --> 28:51.120
- I wanted you to find me.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.129
I wanted you to find me
'cause If you could find me,
you could--could...

28:54.160 --> 28:57.288
you could find him.

28:59.470 --> 29:01.893
- Do you have a shadow, Peter?

29:01.940 --> 29:04.909
Someone only
you can see.

29:04.940 --> 29:08.205
Someone you considered a friend.

29:10.540 --> 29:13.304
He made you feel less alone.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.318
Until you saw what he really is.

29:20.350 --> 29:23.387
- No... no one

29:23.420 --> 29:26.287
will believe me.

29:26.330 --> 29:28.525
He'll make _sure no one
Will believe me.

29:28.560 --> 29:32.269
- I'll make sure they do.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.129
- Every social worker enjoys
certain aspects of the job

29:43.180 --> 29:46.809
more than others.
There are cases that you reach

29:46.850 --> 29:49.512
and cases you don't reach.

29:49.550 --> 29:53.008
- Your notes on Peter
Bernardone's file

29:53.050 --> 29:55.154
are drastically different

29:55.190 --> 29:58.125
than the ones from
his last case worker.
- The soaal serwces system

29:58.160 --> 30:00.378
is far from perfect.

30:00.430 --> 30:03.991
_It's common to omit certain
information on difficult cases

30:04.030 --> 30:06.362
in order to clear
a path in the world

30:06.400 --> 30:09.289
for those stuck
in the weeds.

30:09.340 --> 30:12.832
Peter's had persistent
cognitive problems. Confusion,

30:12.870 --> 30:16.476
paranoia, rage.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.274
Would have refused his case
ifI had known.

30:19.310 --> 30:22.848
- You don't seem to feel
sorry for your client.

30:22.880 --> 30:26.247
A surprising lack of empathy
in a social worker.

30:26.290 --> 30:29.589
- Peter Bernardone has accused
me of killing Sixteen women.

30:29.620 --> 30:33.579
- How does that make you feel?

30:35.960 --> 30:38.497
- Right now I'm feeling
inconvenienced.

30:38.530 --> 30:42.091
I'm being detained on the word
of one very damaged individual.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.301
- You're not being detained,

30:44.340 --> 30:46.308
you're being interviewed.

30:46.340 --> 30:49.503
The FBI is just being thorough.

30:49.540 --> 30:51.542
- What are you writing down?

30:53.550 --> 30:56.246
- An observation.
- About me?

30:56.280 --> 30:58.180
- I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to make you feel

30:58.220 --> 31:02.054
uncomfortable.

31:02.090 --> 31:04.058
- That's smart.

31:04.090 --> 31:07.184
She keeps pushing him on his
feelings, not on the facts.

31:07.230 --> 31:09.357
She's trying to gauge how
comfortable he is With emotion,

31:09.400 --> 31:12.460
if he has any. He couldn't
bear being touched by her.

31:12.500 --> 31:16.038
- Yes, his responses are
typical of psychopaths
during interviews,

31:16.070 --> 31:18.129
but could also be resentment.

31:18.170 --> 31:21.901
- No, his eyes are dead.

31:21.940 --> 31:24.249
He's a predator.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.579
- Did you know Sarah Craber?
- No.

31:27.610 --> 31:30.477
Peter talked about her
extenswely though
during our house visits.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.488
I'd say he was
obsessed with her.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.681
- Do you think
Peter Bernardone

31:34.720 --> 31:37.416
is capable
of murder?

31:37.460 --> 31:40.588
- I'm not a psychiatrist,
Dr. Bloom.

31:40.630 --> 31:42.598
- I'm curious,

31:42.630 --> 31:44.598
Mr. Ingram.

31:44.630 --> 31:46.962
Why did you become
a social worker?

31:48.970 --> 31:51.302
- Society needs caring people.

31:51.340 --> 31:54.400
- It also needs
a few psychopaths...

31:54.440 --> 31:57.375
to keep the rest
of us on our toes.

32:03.180 --> 32:06.445
- There is no evidence
I did this.

32:06.490 --> 32:08.981
And if you'd like
to know how I feel...

32:11.190 --> 32:13.454
I feel like I don't want
to be here anymore.

32:13.490 --> 32:16.357
So, if you're not detaining me,

32:16.400 --> 32:18.664
I'd like to be on my way now.

32:22.100 --> 32:25.331
- Let him go.

32:25.370 --> 32:27.133
- You're making a mistake, Jack.

32:27.170 --> 32:29.604
- I've got nothing
to hold him on.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.643
- Peter Bernardone is
psychologically disadvantaged.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.171
He's been manipulated.
As his social worker,

32:35.220 --> 32:39.179
this man is in a position
of trust, and he has
betrayed that trust.

32:41.190 --> 32:44.978
I know what it's_ like
to pomt at a killer
and have no one listen.

32:45.030 --> 32:48.352
- You pointed in
the wrong direction.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.484
(sobbing)

33:53.090 --> 33:55.058
- What have you
done, Peter?

33:55.100 --> 33:58.592
(gasping)
I'm worried about you.

33:58.630 --> 34:02.236
You've been expressing
a lot of rage recently.

34:06.370 --> 34:09.430
So often in my line of work,
I see people take out
their resentments

34:09.480 --> 34:11.471
on those closest
to them.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.478
It's a sad fact

34:13.510 --> 34:15.740
of human nature.

34:15.780 --> 34:18.749
And you're prone
to extremes of emotion.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.850
The way you think
is compromised.

34:21.890 --> 34:25.519
You're destroying your life.

34:25.560 --> 34:29.121
Sarah was a bitter reminder of
everything you'll never have.
And this...

34:29.160 --> 34:32.266
is the very horse that
kicked you in the head.

34:32.300 --> 34:35.360
- Didn't mean to...
She was just scared.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.198
- Some will say this was
a long time coming.

34:38.240 --> 34:40.265
I know I will. I already have.

34:40.310 --> 34:42.278
(Peter sobbing)

34:42.310 --> 34:44.449
Sixteen women, Peter.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.675
You killed them
because...

34:46.710 --> 34:49.349
you weren't worthy of them.
- You killed them.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.541
You killed them!

34:53.820 --> 34:56.789
- If I had killed them,
it would be because...

34:56.820 --> 35:00.449
they were worthy of me.

35:09.800 --> 35:13.133
(classical music)

35:14.940 --> 35:19.240
(opera aria)

35:24.590 --> 35:27.616
- You look like a man who has
suffered an irrevocable loss.

35:29.690 --> 35:32.227
- I'm trying to prevent one.

35:32.260 --> 35:35.650
- Do you think if you save
Peter Bernardone,

35:35.700 --> 35:38.919
you can save yourself?
- Save myself from What,
Dr. Lecter?

35:38.970 --> 35:42.269
- From Who you
perceive me to be.

35:42.300 --> 35:45.303
- I'm afraid I need to be saved

35:45.340 --> 35:48.605
from who you perceive me to be.
- Many troublesome behaviors

35:48.640 --> 35:52.406
strike when you are
uncertain of yourself.

35:52.450 --> 35:55.817
Peter Bernardone lies in the
same darkness that holds you.

35:55.850 --> 35:58.819
- No...

35:58.850 --> 36:01.910
I'm alone in that darkness.
- You're not alone, Will.

36:01.960 --> 36:05.418
I'm standing right beside you.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.835
- Peter...

36:56.840 --> 37:00.207
Is your social worker
in that horse?

37:02.720 --> 37:05.416
- Yes.

37:05.450 --> 37:09.011
I used to have--used
to have a horrible fear

37:09.060 --> 37:12.587
of--of hurting anything.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.488
But...

37:16.530 --> 37:19.920
he helped me get over that.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.404
Feels so abnormal.

37:26.440 --> 37:29.034
- An abnormal reaction
to an abnormal Situation

37:29.080 --> 37:31.036
is normal behavior.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.640
- I think--

37:33.680 --> 37:36.478
think he deserves to die.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.819
- But...

37:39.850 --> 37:42.011
but you didn't deserve
to kill him, Peter.

37:44.990 --> 37:47.356
I want you
to come with me.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.608
What was
done to you

38:31.640 --> 38:33.608
was cruelty

38:33.640 --> 38:35.835
for cruelty's sake.

38:42.750 --> 38:45.742
- I think I hate him.

38:45.790 --> 38:48.588
- I envy you your hate.

38:50.890 --> 38:53.882
It makes it easier
when you know how to feel.

38:57.160 --> 39:00.027
- What-- makes what easier?

39:03.600 --> 39:05.602
- Killing.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.969
- I--I didn't kill him...

39:14.650 --> 39:17.118
Ijust wanted him
to--to understand

39:17.150 --> 39:20.142
what it's like to--to suffocate

39:20.190 --> 39:23.682
and to--to--to experience

39:23.720 --> 39:26.985
the destiny that he created.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.787
(coughing)

40:14.810 --> 40:16.835
(grunting)
- Mr. Ingram.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.441
Might want to crawl back
in there, if you know
what's good for you.

40:26.650 --> 40:29.517
- Officer...

40:33.630 --> 40:36.793
I'm the victim here.

40:36.830 --> 40:39.128
- I'm not an officer.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.126
I'm Peter's friend.

40:41.170 --> 40:44.799
- Peter's confused.

40:50.010 --> 40:51.841
- I'm not.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.968
Pick up the hammer.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.647
- Will.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.217
- Pick it up.

41:01.920 --> 41:05.083
- It won't feel
the same, Will.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.928
It won't feel like killing me.
- It doesn't have to.

41:10.060 --> 41:12.597
- You did the best
anyone could do for Peter,

41:12.630 --> 41:14.598
but don't do this for him.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.529
If you're going
to do this, Will...

41:17.570 --> 41:20.698
You have to do it for yourself.

41:20.740 --> 41:23.004
- P-Please don't.

41:23.040 --> 41:26.203
- You would be Wise
to remain Silent, Mr. Ingram.

41:27.850 --> 41:29.818
Will.

41:29.850 --> 41:31.989
This is not the reckoning
you promised yourself.

41:48.970 --> 41:50.892
(sobbing)

42:03.120 --> 42:05.611
With all my knowledge
and intrusion, I could never

42:05.650 --> 42:08.084
entirely
predict you.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.918
I can feed
the caterpillar,

42:10.960 --> 42:12.928
and I can Whisper

42:12.960 --> 42:15.599
through the
chrysalis, but...

42:15.630 --> 42:17.325
what hatches

42:17.360 --> 42:19.965
follows its own nature

42:20.000 --> 42:22.139
and is beyond me.

42:29.980 --> 42:32.574
(birds chirping)
