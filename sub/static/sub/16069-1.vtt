<i>I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:49.930
<i>Having my friends here is
great, but it's like...</i>

00:50.092 --> 00:53.892
<i>...making my self-esteem
go down really bad.</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
<i>And they look so good,
and they're just like,</i>

00:56.223 --> 00:59.727
<i>like the hottest girls in the world,
and here I am just like...</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:01.941
<i>- ...and you're...
- Babe.</i>

01:02.854 --> 01:05.447
<i>- I got to get ready.
- No, you don't. Come here.</i>

01:05.607 --> 01:07.200
<i>- That's just it.
- What?</i>

01:07.359 --> 01:10.329
<i>Kendra, you are the
most beautiful woman.</i>

01:10.487 --> 01:13.491
<i>And don't let anybody
coming around...</i>

01:14.616 --> 01:18.621
<i>...after you just had a baby, make
you not feel that way, babe.</i>

01:30.424 --> 01:33.769
Ow!

01:52.904 --> 01:54.372
You want that?

01:54.531 --> 01:56.033
All right, come on. Follow me.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.252
<i>Kendal Strickland wasn't just the
prettiest girl at Waverley Prep,</i>

02:41.411 --> 02:43.584
<i>she was a legend.</i>

02:43.747 --> 02:47.627
<i>As a junior, the student council voted
to dedicate the yearbook to her,</i>

02:47.793 --> 02:50.592
<i>even though another student
had recently died.</i>

04:14.254 --> 04:16.382
<i>Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.</i>

04:16.548 --> 04:18.926
<i>We need that draft
of Waverley</i> 178.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.595
<i>We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.</i>

04:21.762 --> 04:23.435
<i>I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?</i>

04:23.597 --> 04:26.897
When you send something that
soon, it's for the inner circle.

04:27.058 --> 04:30.278
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the
father who doesn't talk to him any more.

04:30.437 --> 04:34.908
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?

04:36.318 --> 04:38.571
You seem a little overly
worked up about this.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.239
I am not worked up
in the slightest.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.784
I was just trying to tell you about
something that happened. God!

04:43.950 --> 04:45.952
Well, good for them, right?

04:46.745 --> 04:48.622
Buddy seems like he'd
be a decent parent.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.925
Can you imagine still
living in Mercury'?

04:53.043 --> 04:57.970
Trapped with a wife and a
kid and some crappy job?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.303
It's like...

05:02.719 --> 05:05.472
It's like he's a hostage.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.732
Yup. We're lucky we got out.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.989
- Yes.
- We have lives.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.494
<i>Let me let you borrow an outfit
'cause that dress is hideous, honey.</i>

with me now to the TV Guide party</i>

05:23.073 --> 05:25.792
<i>because who wants to go to
a party by themselves?</i>

05:25.951 --> 05:28.079
<i>- It's to die for.
- That is fab.</i>

05:33.375 --> 05:36.470
I just think that Tyler and
I are like soul twins.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.972
You know?
Right before he texts me,

05:39.130 --> 05:40.473
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?

05:40.632 --> 05:42.509
Yes! Like psychically.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.475
It's like we have chemistry,
even over our phones.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.060
Like text chemistry.

05:48.223 --> 05:51.272
- <i>'</i> Exactly.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.734
<i>Just as Kendal hit "send," a message
from Ryan popped up like magic.</i>

05:54.896 --> 05:57.399
<i>It couldn't be denied.</i>

05:57.566 --> 05:59.864
<i>They had "textual chemistry."</i>

06:21.464 --> 06:24.593
So, all told, I spent a
year in Southeast Asia.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.558
- Why?
- Uh...

06:27.721 --> 06:30.645
Long story short, I ended up a
volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.230
Oh, my God. Yikes.

06:34.019 --> 06:37.398
Yeah, it was probably one of the most
rewarding things I've ever done.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.283

- Nope.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.334
We actually allow small pets

11:44.495 --> 11:47.294
Good, because I
have a small dog,

Remember? Mavis Gary'?

13:54.917 --> 13:57.796
I'm in town for this
little real estate thing,

13:57.962 --> 14:01.557
and I, um... I don't know, I
just thought if you have time,

14:01.716 --> 14:05.061
and you wanna grab
a drink, catch up?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.897
Something like that. Um...

14:08.056 --> 14:12.357
All right, well, listen, call me and, um...
and let me know.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.855
All right, bye.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.190
Gosh. Wow.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.697
So you're actually
back in town, huh?

15:39.856 --> 15:41.733
<i>Yeah, well, I'm just
passing through.</i>

15:41.899 --> 15:46.154
I am insanely busy as always.

Well, I don't know how
long you're around

15:48.322 --> 15:51.826

but I'd love to grab a drink.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.417
OK.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.800
Well, if you're
feeling spontaneous,

15:58.958 --> 16:02.007
I could meet you at,
uh, Woody's in...

16:03.045 --> 16:04.888
...I don't know, 15 minutes?

16:05.047 --> 16:09.268
Spontaneous really isn't
a thing these days.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.814
I don't know if you heard,
but I am a new dad.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.599
Duh!

16:14.765 --> 16:17.484
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.146
I got that, uh, announcement.

16:21.105 --> 16:24.029
<i>- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.</i>

16:25.234 --> 16:26.702
How about we meet tomorrow

16:26.861 --> 16:29.159
at this place called
Champion O'Malley's?

16:29.322 --> 16:32.747

- Of course, yes. Yeah.</i>

How, um...
how does 8:00, 8:30 sound?

16:36.787 --> 16:39.381
- 6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.589

17:32.051 --> 17:33.052
What?

17:33.761 --> 17:37.140
I'm sorry, but I think we
went to high school together.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.976
- At the same time?
- Yeah.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.520
You're Mavis Gary'?

17:44.730 --> 17:46.732
Mavis Gary-Crane now.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.401
I'm Matt Freehauf.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.912
My locker was actually
next to yours,

17:51.070 --> 17:53.323
all through high school.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.328
Matt... Freehauf.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.996
Yeah.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.460
Yeah, your locker
was right there.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.088
Right next to mine.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.128
We didn't run in
the same circles.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.048
You were pretty popular,
if I remember correctly.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.184
You won "Best Hair."

18:13.342 --> 18:15.936
Did I? What did you win?

18:16.637 --> 18:17.854
I didn't.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.109
Uh, they usually give
out, like, 15 of those,

18:21.267 --> 18:23.736
and only to the
same five people.

18:23.894 --> 18:27.615
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it
was really nice seeing you...

18:27.773 --> 18:31.403
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?

18:31.569 --> 18:33.537
Of course not. Gross.

18:33.696 --> 18:37.041
- No, I live in Minneapolis.
- Oh.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.870
I'm just here taking care of
a little real estate thing.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.040
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.048
Yes, I am an author.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.667
Children's books.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.054
Y.A. That's industry
speak for "Young Adult."

18:50.212 --> 18:52.510
It's a very popular teen series.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.141
It's everywhere. It's huge.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.144
- You've probably seen it.
- Uh, vampires?

19:00.806 --> 19:03.605
"It's A Shame About Ray"

19:08.397 --> 19:11.651
Hey, take that, liver.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.995
Weren't you that
hate crime guy'?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.505
Excuse me?

19:24.664 --> 19:27.543
You totally were.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.585
You're the hate crime guy.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.130
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?

19:32.296 --> 19:34.094
Now I know who you are.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.351
Matt, the hate crime guy.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.558
Yes, Mavis. When I was a...

19:39.720 --> 19:42.690
When we were seniors,

19:42.848 --> 19:46.193
a bunch of jocks who thought I was
gay jumped me in the woods...

19:46.352 --> 19:47.399
That's right.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.905
...and hit me on the legs
and dick with a crowbar.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.700
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.235
It was national news.

19:54.402 --> 19:57.451
I mean, until people found out
that I wasn't really gay.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.366
Then it wasn't a
hate crime any more.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.878
It was a fat guy
getting his ass beat.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.623
Didn't you get to miss
a bunch of school?

20:06.789 --> 20:11.511
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.013
Fuck. How's your dick?

20:15.548 --> 20:18.472
Not good. Not good.

20:18.634 --> 20:22.104
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.270
You know, it's just
kind of does a...

20:29.353 --> 20:31.606
Hard Jacks.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.275
Do you know who drinks these?

20:34.442 --> 20:36.160
I don't.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.946
Buddy Slade.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.366
That's an interesting fact.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.622
Come here.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.337
Do you wanna know why
I'm really in town?

20:51.542 --> 20:52.543
Yes.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.634
I can't tell you in here.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.356
OK, you got me out here.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.564
All right.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.187
Here's the deal.

21:13.564 --> 21:16.363
Buddy Slade and I are
meant to be together.

21:17.568 --> 21:21.823
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade. All right.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.991
I'm pretty sure he's married
with a kid on the way.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.876
No, kid's here.
She already had it.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.788
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.877
So wait, are you not joking?

21:31.040 --> 21:33.384
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.591
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.132
They just tend to
happen in slow motion.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.849
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and
society is, like, fine with that...

21:44.011 --> 21:48.642
...if you take your time, like
an emotional glacier. I'm 37...

21:48.808 --> 21:51.687
Mavis, I would keep all
of this to yourself.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.443
I would find a therapist.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.152
Talk to a professional.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.443
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.327
Don't you get it?

22:00.486 --> 22:02.580
Love conquers all.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.915
Have you not seen The Graduate?

22:06.075 --> 22:08.669
Or, like, I don't
know, anything?

22:08.828 --> 22:10.455
Oh, a taxi.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.669
Yes, we called it. Ma...

25:29.987 --> 25:32.081
Oh. You're gonna wanna
try the popcorn shrimp.

25:32.239 --> 25:35.413
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.

25:35.576 --> 25:38.045
OK.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.282
Hey.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.325
Hey, you.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.914
- Wow.
- Great to see you.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.253
Mm...

26:24.416 --> 26:26.043
So...

26:26.210 --> 26:29.555
This is, uh, quite the
mid-week surprise.

26:29.713 --> 26:33.593
Hey, I ordered us a
couple of Hard Jacks.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.600
I haven't had one of
those since college.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.059
I know, me neither.

26:38.222 --> 26:41.692
But I thought, you know,
just for old times' sake.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.774
Actually, I haven't
been drinking recently.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.781
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and
now that she's nursing our girl,

26:47.940 --> 26:50.819
I thought I'd show
some solidarity.

26:51.527 --> 26:52.528
Right.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.991
So...

26:54.988 --> 26:57.286
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.076
Ad sales now.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.755
My dad's still there, so we
have lunch together most days.

27:02.913 --> 27:07.510
Yeah. Pizza or sub sandwiches.

27:07.668 --> 27:08.669
Awesome.

27:09.503 --> 27:11.972
I've just been working my
little butt off in the city.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.804
You know, doing my thing.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.559
Down there in the
old Mini Apple?

27:15.717 --> 27:19.472
God, Buddy. Nobody calls it
the Mini Apple any more.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.232
I didn't know.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.113
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.320
Give our waitress a break.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.618
So chivalrous.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.916
Mavis.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.174
What are you doing here?

27:48.333 --> 27:49.960
I work here.

27:50.127 --> 27:53.131
You know, bookkeeping,
dealing with vendors.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.100
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?

27:56.258 --> 27:59.102
Just catching up with a friend.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.559
Oh, catching up with a friend.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.105
There's Buddy Slade,

28:05.267 --> 28:08.897
acquiring a couple of
mind-erasers at the bar.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.860
You're not wasting
any time, are you?

28:11.023 --> 28:14.027
Look, it was really great hanging
out with you last night.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.116
- It was great.
<i>- </i> OK.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.655
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.915
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.075
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.119
What a wonderful, permanent
commitment to make.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.129
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.507
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?

28:28.665 --> 28:31.794
Sometimes I feel like <i>a</i> zombie.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.587
But hey, it's so
rewarding, right?

28:33.754 --> 28:35.256
- Yeah.
- Oh.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.516
It's so nice running into him.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.676
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.095
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.

28:41.261 --> 28:44.231
You wanna join us for a round?

28:44.389 --> 28:47.108
I would love to. I would.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.612
Sadly, I have work to do, and
it takes me twice as long

28:50.771 --> 28:53.615
as an able-bodied person to
complete even the simplest task.

28:53.774 --> 28:54.991
- So...
- Bummer.

28:55.150 --> 29:00.077
I don't wanna step on your
Mercury High reunion. So...

29:00.239 --> 29:02.241
Go, go, lnjuns.

29:02.407 --> 29:08.255
Actually, uh, they changed the name
to "indians" back in '99, remember?

29:08.413 --> 29:10.962
The local Fond du Lac tribe...

29:11.124 --> 29:13.422
...did a whole thing with...

29:14.544 --> 29:15.887
It sucks, what happened to Matt.

29:16.046 --> 29:19.391
That poor guy suffered so
much just for being gay.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.472
He's not actually gay.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.722
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.559
Didn't you call him a theater fag
all the time in high school?

29:28.725 --> 29:30.693
"Theater fag" is an
expression, Buddy.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.149
Well, whatever.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.690
Mercury's changed a lot
since then, though.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.358
We're way less of a hick town.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.361
- Really?
- Mm.

29:39.528 --> 29:43.283
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?

29:43.448 --> 29:45.450
And we're getting a new
Chipotle at the mall.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.915
And I noticed you
got a KenTacoHut.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.212
You know, one of those Kentucky
Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...

29:52.374 --> 29:53.500
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.716
That's genius. KenTacoHut.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.506
You sound like one of
your crazy characters.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.475
Hey, so how's Allen?

30:04.261 --> 30:07.606
- Allen is great. Yeah.
- Mmmm.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.232
Yeah, he's good.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.023
We're not married
any more, but...

30:13.186 --> 30:15.439
Oh, sorry. I didn't...

30:15.605 --> 30:18.984
No, don't be sorry.
It's good. It's fine.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.908
Well, that's Allen's loss.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.541
It sucks to be Allen.

30:30.287 --> 30:32.540
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.

30:32.706 --> 30:35.175
She's got band practice tonight.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.382
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.342
Just something she does
with the other moms.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.015
Wow, cool.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.472
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.

30:44.634 --> 30:47.262
Oh, my God. Embarrassing.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.022
Ah...

30:50.932 --> 30:53.776
Actually, her band's playing
here tomorrow night.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.939
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow
night to our house for a hang?

30:57.105 --> 30:59.608
We can have dinner, and then
come here and see Beth's show.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.777
- I would love that.
- Yeah.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.580
Oh, this is kind of silly,

31:04.738 --> 31:09.244
<i>but would you mind signing one</i> of
<i>those Waverley Place books for me?</i>

31:10.118 --> 31:11.415
Sure.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.330
I mean, it's not
for me, obviously.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.670
It's for my niece, Kendra.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.630
She wants to be a
writer someday.

31:17.793 --> 31:20.717
Right, of course.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.975
Um, but you know, my name
isn't actually on the books.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.135
I mean, it's on the title
page if you check inside.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.896
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.646
It's still a pretty big deal,
compared to the rest of us.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.781
It was so great seeing you.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.360
I always feel like we can pick
up right where we left off.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.155
Exactly.

31:47.823 --> 31:51.123
You know what?
You look the same.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.376
<i>I do?</i>

31:55.539 --> 31:58.634
Yeah, it's like the rest of us
changed, you just got lucky.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.224
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.101
- OK.
- Good night.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.218
Hello?

32:50.385 --> 32:52.183
Look, I just want you to know

32:52.345 --> 32:56.475
that what you think you saw
tonight is not what it was, OK?

32:56.641 --> 33:00.396
Oh, so you're not trying to
destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.

33:00.562 --> 33:04.567
It is way more complicated than you
can possibly ever understand, OK?

33:04.733 --> 33:07.532
Buddy Slade and I have years
and years of history,

33:07.694 --> 33:10.538
and it is very rich,
and very complex.

33:10.697 --> 33:15.043
Wow, yeah, that sounds way
beyond my comprehension.

33:15.202 --> 33:17.625
Don't open a new ranch
till the old one's done.

33:17.787 --> 33:21.041
- What?
- That's my sister. Forget it.

33:22.125 --> 33:25.004
- Just so you know.
- I got it. Thank you.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.715
Do you want to get
loaded, or something?

33:48.109 --> 33:49.156
I'm Mavis.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.413
I know. From high school.

33:53.949 --> 33:54.950
Right.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.962
I made you those Rice Krispies squares
that one time for your birthday.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.540
I got your locker combination
from the vice principal.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.253
I put them in your locker?

34:07.003 --> 34:08.505
Thank you.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.469
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.

34:24.478 --> 34:28.234
"Pledge Your Allegiance"

35:02.892 --> 35:04.735
Welcome to the distillery.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.781
Are you making moonshine?

35:07.939 --> 35:10.658
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.239
You know what? Hang on.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.743
All right. Check this out.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.210
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.

35:20.368 --> 35:23.713
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...

35:23.872 --> 35:26.170
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.670
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.716
Mos Eisley... Star <i>Wars</i> thing.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.385
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...

35:36.551 --> 35:39.521
Let's let that age
a little longer.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.899
And I got another in here.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.480
OK.

35:46.102 --> 35:49.527
Now, see if you can detect...

35:50.440 --> 35:51.783
...some of the new oak.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.989
- Oh, come on.
- OK.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.947
They're kind of hidden in there.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.207
So when you sip...

36:05.330 --> 36:07.628
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.339
Let's do <i>a</i> little...

36:11.670 --> 36:12.717
There you go.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.606
Mm.

36:26.393 --> 36:27.440
Woody.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.070
Oak.

36:30.897 --> 36:35.619
So how'd the rest of
your little date go?

36:35.777 --> 36:37.950
- Good. It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?

36:38.113 --> 36:41.333
I mean, Buddy's
clearly not happy.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.744
OK, he actually said that?

36:44.577 --> 36:46.045
He implied it.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.790
You can tell, he's
totally suffering.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.255
He looks completely exhausted.

36:51.418 --> 36:54.012
You know he told me he
feels like a zombie.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.970
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.094
That's a pretty strong
statement to make.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.263
I mean, a zombie is a
dead person, not...

37:03.430 --> 37:06.934
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.730
I think Buddy and I are
having very similar feelings.

37:12.772 --> 37:16.367
The question is, who's
gonna make the first move?

37:17.861 --> 37:21.741
I'm thinking... it will be you.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.204
Hm...

37:25.785 --> 37:28.664
- Aren't you a little old for G.l. Joes?
- That one's still wet.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.925
No, it's fine. Jesus.

37:35.128 --> 37:39.804
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.

37:41.050 --> 37:44.725
That one... I took Copperhead's face,
and I put it on Mongul's body,

37:44.888 --> 37:46.811
so it's like a
beefed-up Copperhead,

37:46.973 --> 37:48.975
and then I added
Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.815
I was tired and drunk.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.071
You ever make, like, girl dolls?

37:53.229 --> 37:55.072
I'm not a weirdo.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.451
I have to go check on something.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.907
Oh, OK.

38:00.069 --> 38:03.164
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.752
I think this is it.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.298
You think, or you know?

38:19.464 --> 38:22.718
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.

38:22.884 --> 38:27.355
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.152
You're fuckin' mentally ill.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.530
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.

38:41.027 --> 38:43.155
I bet Buddy is awake...

38:43.947 --> 38:46.245
...jerking off or something.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.910
Or perhaps he's caring
for his infant daughter.

38:50.119 --> 38:52.338
The baby, the baby.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.083
The problem that has no name.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.412
Can I help you find something?

39:28.575 --> 39:30.577
Sure, I'm not having
a ton of luck here.

39:30.743 --> 39:33.542
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.048
It's not a formal occasion.

39:35.206 --> 39:39.962
I'm looking for something chic,
clean, but also a bit edgy.

39:40.128 --> 39:43.257
OK. We have some adorable new
dresses that just came in.

39:43.423 --> 39:48.054
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.599
I'm going to a rock
concert with an old ﬂame,

39:52.765 --> 39:55.393
and I think there is a
chance we may reconnect.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.153
Let's show him what
he's been missing.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.907
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.

40:01.900 --> 40:05.120
But his wife hasn't seen
me in a while, so...

40:07.030 --> 40:09.453
Well, it's the end of my shift,

40:09.616 --> 40:11.744
and my son has to be
picked up from school.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.288
So I'm just gonna send
over another associate.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.297
She's up on all the trends.

40:16.456 --> 40:17.628
Shawna!

40:24.380 --> 40:26.474
<i>Where are the
Waverley Prep books?</i>

40:26.633 --> 40:28.886
They got their own display
table right there.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.017
Wow.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.150
They must be really popular.

40:35.308 --> 40:37.902
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus
stock we're trying to clear out.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.904
They were big a
couple years ago,

40:40.063 --> 40:42.282
but the computer says,
"Do not shelve," so...

40:45.276 --> 40:47.779
Hey, are you writing in there?

40:47.946 --> 40:50.495
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.368
You're Jane MacMurray'?

40:54.369 --> 40:58.090
No. Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.

40:58.247 --> 41:00.966
Mavis Gary-Crane. See?

41:05.838 --> 41:07.385
Do you know Jane MacMurray?

41:07.548 --> 41:08.970
Yes, I know her really well.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.181
- I wrote the book.
- OK.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.681
Do you want a signed
copy for your store?

41:16.224 --> 41:17.271
No, that's fine.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.687
I can sign <i>as</i> many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.

41:20.853 --> 41:24.528
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed,
we can't send it back to the publisher.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.320
Why would you be sending
it back to the publisher?

41:29.237 --> 41:31.490
We're probably not
gonna sell them.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.408
The series is done.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.380
Come on, I told you you
can't write in the...

41:43.543 --> 41:45.841
Whatever, book man.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.396
<i>Kendal Strickland never
felt threatened.</i>

41:55.555 --> 41:59.276
<i>If anything, she felt a deep sense
of pity for this rebound girl.</i>

41:59.434 --> 42:02.938
<i>Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.</i>

42:03.104 --> 42:05.778
<i>That said, she couldn't
help her own popularity.</i>

42:05.940 --> 42:10.116
<i>It wasn't her fault that one year she
was nominated homecoming queen...</i>

42:10.278 --> 42:12.406
<i>...of a neighboring high school.</i>

42:12.572 --> 42:16.543
<i>Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.</i>

42:16.701 --> 42:18.624
<i>Other girls were so insecure,</i>

42:18.786 --> 42:21.960
<i>stressing about their faces and
their figures, not Kendal.</i>

42:22.123 --> 42:26.503
<i>Hers was a gracious, effortless
beauty that glowed from within.</i>

42:26.669 --> 42:30.640
<i>However, being that beautiful
could also be intimidating.</i>

42:30.798 --> 42:33.392
<i>Some guys went for girls
who were more ordinary.</i>

42:34.010 --> 42:37.310
<i>How could Kendal make sure her own
perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan...</i>

42:38.556 --> 42:40.229
<i>...the love of her life?</i>

42:54.113 --> 42:56.741
- What up?
- Hey.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.415
How are you?

42:59.577 --> 43:02.706
- Ooh. How are you?
- Good, good.

43:03.623 --> 43:06.001
Here's that book for your niece.

43:06.167 --> 43:09.797
Oh, yeah. Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.

43:09.962 --> 43:12.090
There is a character in that
one that's based on you.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.342
- What?
- In the book.

43:14.509 --> 43:17.513
I mean, I named him Ashby,
but it's so blatantly you.

43:18.221 --> 43:21.100
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.562
We're not even
supposed to do that.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.523
We're supposed to stick to
this character bible...

43:24.685 --> 43:25.982
Hey.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.698
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.

43:28.856 --> 43:30.073
You, too.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.152
Oh...

43:34.403 --> 43:36.906
There it is.

43:37.073 --> 43:38.916
Adorable.

43:39.075 --> 43:40.122
Thank you.

43:40.284 --> 43:43.163
Aw...

43:44.747 --> 43:47.341
You love it. You love it.

43:48.835 --> 43:50.382
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?

43:50.545 --> 43:52.263
Oh, just a water.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.219
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.

43:56.008 --> 43:58.056
It's fine. I'll just pump
and dump after the show.

43:58.219 --> 44:00.813
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.692
Wow, look at that.

44:04.851 --> 44:08.856
Ah, yes. The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.

44:09.021 --> 44:11.524
Yeah, yeah.

44:11.691 --> 44:15.161
Yes, yes it does.

44:15.319 --> 44:16.866
Oh, starting to get smiles.

44:17.697 --> 44:18.869
Cute.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.079
She's, like, Buddy's clone.

44:23.244 --> 44:25.793
No. I see you in there.

44:25.955 --> 44:28.799
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.926
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.554
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

44:33.713 --> 44:36.432
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.

44:36.591 --> 44:38.468
I saw a nice article about
you in the <i>Sun.</i>

44:38.634 --> 44:41.683
Yes, I'm an author of
a young adult series.

44:41.846 --> 44:43.689
It's disturbingly popular.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.150
I like your decor.

44:51.314 --> 44:52.736
Is it shabby chic?

44:53.649 --> 44:55.071
Pier One?

44:55.234 --> 44:57.202
A little bit Goodwill.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.489
Buddy and I used to go
thrifting all the time.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.908
Remember that? The '90s?

45:03.951 --> 45:07.376
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.132
It was just, like, the
dumbest thing ever.

45:10.291 --> 45:12.259
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.

45:13.085 --> 45:15.304
I used to sleep in his
T-shirts and boxers.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.139
I think I still have a few.

45:21.928 --> 45:24.807
Hey. I still have one of my
ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.

45:24.972 --> 45:27.475
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?

45:27.642 --> 45:30.191
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.

45:32.521 --> 45:34.239
What's the chart?

45:34.398 --> 45:36.617
Uh... Oh.

45:36.776 --> 45:40.155
- Beth teaches special needs kids.
- Oh.

45:40.321 --> 45:43.120
A lot of my kids learn
emotions cognitively.

45:43.282 --> 45:45.535
It doesn't come naturally to them
the way it does for you and me.

45:45.701 --> 45:48.420
So we need to show them "this
is what happy looks like,"

45:48.579 --> 45:51.082
"this is what anxious
looks like," and so on.

45:51.249 --> 45:52.671
What about neutral?

45:53.584 --> 45:56.758
I mean, like, what if you
don't feel anything?

45:56.921 --> 46:00.016
That's kind of how they
are a lot of the time.

46:00.174 --> 46:03.474
So, yeah, don't
need to teach it.

46:09.475 --> 46:10.601
Oh, my God.

46:10.768 --> 46:13.942
- Is that Mavis Gary'?
- Yeah.

46:14.105 --> 46:16.278
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.

46:17.483 --> 46:18.951
Shots.

46:19.110 --> 46:21.704
Psychotic prom queen bitch.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.239
Really'?

46:23.990 --> 46:25.663
Come on, tequila time.

46:26.242 --> 46:27.539
Salt.

46:33.541 --> 46:36.511
So... are they any good?

46:36.669 --> 46:38.512
Yeah, they're all right.

46:38.671 --> 46:42.676
Mm-hm. I knew it.
They're horrible. I knew it.

46:42.842 --> 46:45.812
- Well, they have a lot of fun.
- Hm...

46:45.970 --> 46:48.393
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.

46:49.348 --> 46:53.478
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy. Look at his face.

46:53.644 --> 46:57.740
He's so doughy.
He's like <i>a</i> murderer.

46:57.898 --> 47:00.026
Think he owns any clown suits?

47:01.193 --> 47:03.946
- Oh, my God. You're terrible.
- Come on.

47:04.989 --> 47:06.912
- Dark.
- No.

47:07.742 --> 47:09.870
Hello, Mercury!

47:13.581 --> 47:15.049
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.

47:15.207 --> 47:17.255
We are Nipple Confusion.

47:17.418 --> 47:19.011
Yeah.

47:19.170 --> 47:23.391
Please be kind, as this is,
um, only our second show.

47:23.549 --> 47:26.052
And we all have small
children at home.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.146
Our first song is a cover.

47:29.305 --> 47:31.933
This one goes out from
our drummer, Beth,

47:32.099 --> 47:34.818
to her sweetheart, Buddy.

47:37.855 --> 47:41.234
<i>♪ She wears denim
wherever she goes</i>

47:41.400 --> 47:45.246
<i>♪ Says she's gonna get some
records by the Status Quo</i>

47:45.404 --> 47:47.156
<i>♪ Oh, yeah</i>

47:48.908 --> 47:51.081
<i>♪ Oh, yeah</i>

47:53.412 --> 47:57.462
<i>♪ Still she won't be
forced against her will</i>

47:57.625 --> 48:01.129
<i>♪ Says she don't do drugs

48:01.295 --> 48:02.842
<i>♪ Oh, yeah</i>

48:05.049 --> 48:06.676
<i>♪ Oh, yeah</i>

48:10.429 --> 48:13.524

48:17.895 --> 48:21.069
<i>♪ I didn't want to hurt you</i>

48:54.265 --> 48:56.734
Remember when we used to
make out to this song?

48:58.436 --> 48:59.904
Yeah.

49:00.062 --> 49:04.238
Yeah, I think this song was playing
the first time I went down on you.

49:06.068 --> 49:08.696
- Huh?
- The first time I went...

49:14.160 --> 49:15.628
Uh-huh.

50:00.247 --> 50:02.591
Oh! Wow.

50:02.750 --> 50:04.252
I screwed up the fill so bad.

50:04.418 --> 50:06.295
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.

50:06.462 --> 50:08.260
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?

50:08.422 --> 50:09.890
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.

50:10.049 --> 50:13.644
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait. Did you just say "namazing"?

50:13.802 --> 50:16.225
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.

50:16.388 --> 50:17.981
Hardly.

50:19.183 --> 50:22.187
It's so interesting to see you
hanging around again, Mavis.

50:23.771 --> 50:26.194
Mary Ellen, you
were great tonight.

50:26.357 --> 50:29.736
It's so inspiring to see a single mother
with so much confidence on stage.

50:29.902 --> 50:31.370
Really.

50:31.529 --> 50:32.781
Beth, we gotta get home.

50:32.947 --> 50:34.824
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.583
I wanna stay out just a
little while longer.

50:36.742 --> 50:38.710
Yeah, Buddy, you can't
have her back tonight.

50:38.869 --> 50:40.246
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.

50:40.412 --> 50:41.709
Really'?

50:43.165 --> 50:45.759
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.

50:45.918 --> 50:47.545
- You sure?
- Mmmm.

50:50.965 --> 50:52.717
Have fun.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.348
Thanks, Mavis.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.080
Whoa!

51:19.243 --> 51:20.460
Easy.

51:21.537 --> 51:23.335
Tolerance has gone down
since you knew me.

51:23.497 --> 51:25.841
What do you mean,
since I knew you?

51:26.000 --> 51:28.423
- I still know you. Come here.
- Yeah.

51:28.586 --> 51:31.009
- Wait.
- What?

51:32.339 --> 51:34.512
Don't you have that
babysitter till 11:00?

51:35.801 --> 51:37.803
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.

51:39.013 --> 51:41.436
I know, we can't, but...

51:43.726 --> 51:45.649
...time is just so precious.

51:47.187 --> 51:48.609
For real.

51:49.523 --> 51:52.618
- It goes so fast.
- I know.

51:54.069 --> 51:57.494
Man, I really love my
daughter, you know?

51:57.656 --> 51:59.499
I know, I know.

52:00.326 --> 52:02.954
I can tell you're
a great father.

52:04.913 --> 52:08.543
You're already going above
and beyond in so many ways.

52:09.752 --> 52:12.505
You stepped up to
the plate, Buddy.

52:12.671 --> 52:15.641
You do too much, even.

52:15.799 --> 52:17.642
You think so?

52:17.801 --> 52:19.018
Yes.

52:21.305 --> 52:24.104
You're a good, good man, Buddy.

52:28.437 --> 52:30.439
Don't ever shortchange yourself.

52:39.615 --> 52:41.538
I thought I saw lights.

52:42.117 --> 52:43.790
Hi, Daniel. Yep, I'm home.

52:43.952 --> 52:45.204
Where's Beth?

52:45.371 --> 52:47.999
She wanted to stay out
and party all night.

52:48.165 --> 52:52.716
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and
she doesn't want her "nuk" any more.

52:52.878 --> 52:54.300
I got it.

52:55.964 --> 52:57.466
Good night, Buddy.

52:57.633 --> 52:58.850
Good night.

53:00.928 --> 53:02.896
Thank you. Yeah.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.192
Wow.

53:08.852 --> 53:11.355
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.

53:11.522 --> 53:15.618
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.

53:15.776 --> 53:17.494
Why don't you walk, fat ass?

53:17.653 --> 53:19.451
There's some low-hanging fruit.

53:19.613 --> 53:22.913
You are low-hanging fruit.

53:23.867 --> 53:26.495
- Oh, no. No.
- What?

53:26.662 --> 53:28.539
I hate this guy over here.

53:32.501 --> 53:34.503
That's my cousin, Mike.

53:34.670 --> 53:36.889
Mike Moran is your cousin?

53:37.047 --> 53:38.970
Unfortunately.

53:39.133 --> 53:41.852
Oh, here comes the happiest
cripple in Minnesota.

53:42.469 --> 53:43.891
- Mavis?
- Mike.

53:44.054 --> 53:45.727
What is up, girly-friend?

53:45.889 --> 53:48.233
Holy shit, coz, this is
such a rad surprise.

53:48.392 --> 53:51.612
Yeah, I'm in town just for a
little real estate thing.

53:51.770 --> 53:53.568
- How are you? Yeah.
- I'm great.

53:53.731 --> 53:55.904
Kim and I just had our
six-year anniversary.

53:56.066 --> 53:58.615
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood? Porcelain?

53:58.777 --> 54:01.451
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.

54:01.613 --> 54:03.411
Work is a trip, but
I play hard too.

54:03.574 --> 54:05.952
I've been doing a lot
of rock climbing.

54:06.118 --> 54:08.120
You mean rock crawling, right?

54:08.287 --> 54:09.960
No, I'm vertical, bro,
believe it or not.

54:10.122 --> 54:12.591
We can do anything
<i>a</i> normal can do.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.549
Probably more, because we've had
to reboot for extra positivity.

54:15.711 --> 54:18.339
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.

54:18.505 --> 54:21.224
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.852
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."

54:25.095 --> 54:27.814
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.395
<i>It's like Will & Grace.</i>

54:29.558 --> 54:32.937
- Aw, it is.
- No, it isn't.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.401
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my
boys, but we should chat later.

54:35.564 --> 54:37.566
I'll buy you a scotch or
whatever you got there.

54:37.733 --> 54:39.986
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?

54:41.111 --> 54:43.284
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?

54:43.447 --> 54:45.825
Junior. Car wreck.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.873
God, he got so much attention.

54:49.036 --> 54:54.384
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.

54:54.541 --> 54:58.136
Please. That dick ruined
my sweet 16, same weekend.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.093
God, you are a piece of work.

55:01.173 --> 55:03.141
You're a piece of shit.

55:25.447 --> 55:29.327
<i>You know there's stuff all over the
Internet about how you're a cougar.</i>

55:29.493 --> 55:31.336
<i>How</i> I'm a cougar?

55:31.495 --> 55:34.624
<i>- I'm not even 30 years old.
- You're a cougar.</i>

55:34.790 --> 55:38.385
<i>I am turning 30 this year
and I am freaked out.</i>

55:38.544 --> 55:40.717
<i>It's pretty old.</i>

55:40.879 --> 55:44.349
<i>Kim Kardashian channels
her own inner cougar.</i>

56:01.567 --> 56:02.568
Fuck.

56:02.734 --> 56:07.865
<i>The kiss was electric, transformative,
spiritual, enchanted.</i>

56:08.031 --> 56:11.251
<i>It was like their first
kiss all over again,</i>

56:11.410 --> 56:13.583
<i>except now they knew exactly
what they were doing.</i>

56:13.745 --> 56:15.918
I said, "Listen, Kyle,
you're everything to me."

56:16.081 --> 56:20.257
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"

56:20.419 --> 56:23.263
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.

56:23.422 --> 56:24.890
I'm gonna have a...

56:32.222 --> 56:33.314
Hey, you.

56:33.473 --> 56:36.317
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.

56:36.476 --> 56:38.194
Last night was amazing.

56:38.353 --> 56:40.697
Um, how much longer are
you gonna be in town?

56:40.856 --> 56:43.609
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?

56:43.775 --> 56:45.823
I was just wondering if you're
still in town this weekend,

56:45.986 --> 56:48.114
if you wanna come to the
baby's naming ceremony.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.375
<i>It's this little hippy thing
we're doing out in the yard.</i>

56:51.533 --> 56:53.126
It's not religious
or anything...

56:53.285 --> 56:54.912
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.

56:55.078 --> 56:58.378
Um... Saturday at the
house, around 1:00.

56:58.540 --> 57:01.384
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.

57:25.442 --> 57:27.069
Hey, Mom.

57:28.904 --> 57:30.702
Were you even gonna say hello?

57:31.949 --> 57:34.498
It's been so long, I almost
forgot what you look like.

57:34.660 --> 57:38.961
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom. OK?
I was planning on calling.

57:40.290 --> 57:42.338
Why didn't you just
come and stay with us?

57:42.501 --> 57:45.721
Because I needed a
quiet place to write.

57:46.964 --> 57:50.138
You have no idea. I have tons and
tons of work to catch up on.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.344
Books still selling well?

57:52.511 --> 57:55.560
It's like I can hardly keep up.

57:55.722 --> 57:58.771
Is that the money you used to
invest in local real estate?

58:00.894 --> 58:01.895
Huh?

58:02.062 --> 58:05.612
I heard you were here to work on some
kind of real estate transaction.

58:06.650 --> 58:09.654
I was just surprised you didn't
use Aunt Lena as your broker.

58:10.988 --> 58:13.741
She's a little hurt.

58:18.203 --> 58:19.876
- Honey?
- Huh?

58:20.038 --> 58:21.881
- Look what I found.
- What?

58:23.083 --> 58:25.177
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

58:25.335 --> 58:27.258
Our little real
estate tycoon, huh?

58:27.421 --> 58:28.923
Oh, I don't know about that.

58:29.673 --> 58:30.674
Who's this?

58:30.841 --> 58:32.263
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.

58:32.426 --> 58:34.053
- Dolce.
- Hello.

59:48.251 --> 59:50.253
I hope you're eating
enough in the city.

59:50.420 --> 59:52.514
You gotta start taking
care of yourself, sweetie.

59:52.672 --> 59:55.050
You know, a Lean
Cuisine is not a meal.

59:55.801 --> 59:57.599
Yeah, I think I might
be an alcoholic.

59:57.761 --> 59:59.855
Very funny.

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:07.608
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.444
It's just that your
hair is so beautiful.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.655
You know what, Mom? Can you please
take down that photo of me and Allen?

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:14.411
Which picture, sweetie?

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:17.573
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.913
We just thought it
was a nice memory.

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:23.045
Of my failed marriage?

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.546
Well, the wedding
wasn't a failure.

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:26.581
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.376
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:32.296
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.594
Have you seen any old
friends on this visit?

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:37.100
Actually...

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.099
...I've been seeing
quite a bit of Buddy.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:41.889
Oh, the old beau, huh?

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:44.942
I remember you kids were
so cute in high school.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:49.396
It's funny how those initial
instincts can be so right, you know?

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.657
I mean, you make all these
mistakes along the way,

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:55.160
but the world will make sure you end up
with the person you're meant to be with.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.413
It's good to keep those
people in your life.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.324
The people who really
know you best.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.992
<i>Mmmm.</i>

01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:06.876
And that new baby of
his is just darling.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:11.464
Have you seen it? Up close?

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.003
I suppose.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:15.718
Is everything OK?

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:22.062
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.352
It's just that Buddy
used to say that...

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:32.898
...we would make the cutest
little babies, ever.

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:39.405
Hey, did you guys ever
sell my Cabriolet?

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:54.344
Yeah! Sweet ride.

01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:56.129
What is that, a drop-top?

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.969
I just saw my mother and father.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.850
Oh, heavy. How are they?

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:04.434
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:07.770
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:09.526
Come on. Let's hit the woods
in the back of the school.

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.652
- And grab some of that <i>Star Wars</i> juice.
- That's a limited...

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:14.485
- Come on!
- Fine.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:18.864
Could you walk any slower?

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.573
Our school is so ugly.

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:25.867
It looks like a factory.

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:30.210
It actually used to be a rubber
fabrication plant back in the '20s.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:32.708
You know everything.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:40.307
These woods were like Hump
City back in the day.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:43.014
I remember being back here
with a few different guys.

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:46.142
I never knew you
were such a slut.

01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:49.141
I was normal.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:56.319
Uh... So how are things
with old Buddy, huh?

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:59.030
How's the master plan unfolding?

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:02.071
Well, actually, he
called me today

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:07.494
and asked me if I wanted to participate
in his baby's naming ceremony.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.336
I don't know.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:13.715
There's still so much
that's unspoken, but...

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.376
...he's involving me
in his child's life.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:18.591
Buddy is a married man.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:20.300
By all accounts, happily.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.467
Yeah, happily married
men go to bars alone

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.886
with their ex-girlfriends
all the time.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:29.056
They call them privately, and they
make out with them on porches.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:31.975
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:36.022
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:38.490
He gave me his sweatshirt.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:42.118
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:45.998
And FYI, you look completely
insane wearing it.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.909
Look, I don't know what
Buddy's doing with you,

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:53.251
or what you think he's doing with
you, but you need to move on.

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:55.962
You're one to talk.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:58.547
All you care about is some scuffle
that happened 20 years ago.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.429
You lean on that crutch,
and you lean on excuses,

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:03.886
and you and I both know
you use this whole thing

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:06.302
as an excuse to do absolutely
nothing with your life.

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:11.059
"Scuffle."

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.101
You don't know shit about
what happened to me.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:19.439
OK? Those jocks you used
to blow during lunch...

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:23.360
...they shattered my legs,

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.245
bashed in my brains,

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:28.156
mangled my cock,

01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:33.079
so that I have to piss and cum
sideways for the rest of my life.

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:36.255
Then they left me for dead.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:41.461
You know, things aren't
too great down south.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:47.051
I can barely get off by myself,
let alone with another person.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.984
You know, what's done is done.

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:02.907
You can't keep dwelling
on the past, Matt.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.363
Are you fucking kidding?

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.862
Talk about dwelling in the past.

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:10.953
Here you are back in
Mercury, like a loser,

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:13.414
trying to score with a
happily married man.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.455
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:20.296
You're hardly the authority
on happiness, Sylvia.

01:05:22.627 --> 01:05:24.220
You know what, Matt?

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:26.256
It really is a shame
that you're like this,

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:28.221
because if you had a
good personality,

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:30.431
none of this other stuff
would bother people.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.891
Why don't you use my crutch
again as a metaphor?

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:35.807
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:40.195
Or no, save it for your
little teenage stories,

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.448
because God knows you don't
know shit about being an adult!

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:54.455
<i>It wasn't the first time Kendal
Strickland was let down.</i>

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:58.212
<i>For all the good they did, beauty and
popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.</i>

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:02.384
<i>Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?</i>

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:07.173
<i>Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march
of being special a little too well.</i>

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:09.557
<i>She was used to blazing
her own trail.</i>

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:13.687
<i>It was obvious that Ryan still
loved her, crystal clear.</i>

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:16.439
<i>And perhaps that was unfair
to his new girlfriend,</i>

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:20.353
<i>but Kendal Strickland was going to
think about herself for a change.</i>

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:22.691
<i>Who was taking care of Kendal?</i>

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:25.110
<i>And on the subject of fair...</i>

01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:27.696
<i>Was it fair that people misjudged
Kendal's intelligence</i>

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:29.736
<i>just because she
was so beautiful?</i>

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:33.953
<i>Was it fair everyone thought her life
was so easy, when it was anything but?</i>

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:35.833
<i>No. Life wasn't fair,</i>

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:39.496
<i>and it was up to Kendal to step
in and make things right.</i>

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:43.633
<i>Sometimes in order to heal, a
few people have to get hurt.</i>

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.504
"Pressure Drop"

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.441
Hi, Jan.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.854
Oh, hi.

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:30.656
Wow, really been a long time.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:32.908
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:34.740
Yeah, I've heard that.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.371
Buddy's been very
busy, and Bethie.

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.743
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:45.046
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:47.171
Wow. How are you doing?

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:49.667
Mm. I'm good.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:51.426
- Good.
- I brought presents.

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:53.008
Oh, thank you.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:56.550
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:58.093
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.057
Can you help Beth with
that endive thing?

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:01.640
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.478
Uh, yeah. Ooh!

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.395
Are you having fun? Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.563
I think we should
talk privately.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.823
Sure, yeah. Um...

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.779
Here, follow me.

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:26.416
OK.

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:33.048
OK, so what's going on?

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.718
There are so many things I
know we both wanna say.

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:39.975
OK, well, we don't have
to say them all now.

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:42.808
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:47.020
You're so thoughtful,
even during all this.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.402
Well, hey, she pushed it out.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:53.861
I just want you to know that I'm feeling
everything that you're feeling.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:58.202
Buddy, these last few days have
been some of the best in my life.

01:09:58.903 --> 01:09:59.950
They have?

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:03.624
You don't have to pretend.

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:07.620
I know what's in here...

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:11.837
...and I know what's in here.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:17.881
Buddy...
you're my moon, my stars.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.173
You're my whole galaxy.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.469
Mavis! What are you doing?

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:31.818
OK.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:37.860
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:40.995
You can come to the city with
me, like we always planned.

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:43.373
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:46.660
We can work this out. You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:50.672
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know. We can beat this together.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.721
You're better than this.

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:04.557
I have to go.

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:08.439
I think you should leave.

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:17.197
Hey, look who's up.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:19.279
Hey, let me take her.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:21.444
Let me... Come here.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:22.954
There you are.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.331
There you are. Oh...

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:29.414
Can you do me a favor?

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:30.999
We need everybody outside.

01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:34.712
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:38.090
Those are delicious.

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:52.391
Hey, listen up, everyone!

01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:55.402
I think Buddy has a
little surprise for Beth,

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:59.156
so if you could all just come outside
and gather around the garage.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.317
Come on, let's go.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:18.217
Mavis?

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:19.753
- What?
- Are you OK?

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:21.967
I'll be fine if I can get
a real drink around here.

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:25.800
Uh... There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.014
You know what?

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:28.803
Oh, my God.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:31.597
Uh... I'll...

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:35.230
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:36.895
Fuck you!

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.860
You fucking bitch.

01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:46.033
Oh, my God.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.657
You should see your face.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.500
It's a joke.

01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:54.128
Are you just gonna stand
there like a big lump?

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.339
I love your sweater.

01:12:58.165 --> 01:12:59.257
I'll get you a rag.

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:01.715
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so
many of those lying around here.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.097
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:05.677
You know, the funny thing is,

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.184
I could have had this
party a long time ago.

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:10.970
This exact same party. Yeah.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.014
Buddy and I were
together for four years,

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.648
and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:16.400
Right, Jan? Tell them!

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.277
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.

01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:20.655
It is silk. It's fucked.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:21.860
Mavis, sweetheart.

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.025
Mother, I'm trying to
tell a story here.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.363
Yeah, Buddy got me
pregnant at 20.

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.076
And we were gonna keep it!

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:33.789
Mm-hm. We were gonna
have a little baby,

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:35.794
and a little naming party,

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:39.423
and a Funquarium,
and all of that.

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.676
And then 12 weeks into it...

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:45.964
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.717
Which I wouldn't
wish for anyone.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:55.478
Maybe if things were just a
little bit more hospitable

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.143
down south in my broken body,

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:00.562
Buddy and I would be here
right now with a teenager,

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:02.526
and probably even more kids,

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.782
because we always found each other.
Always!

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.784
Right, Jan? Tell them!

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:10.204
What the fuck?

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.294
It's a new drum set for Beth.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.339
What's wrong?

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:31.517
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:33.519
My God! What is wrong with you?

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:35.146
Are you like one of
those little kids

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.398
who need a fucking chart
to learn feelings?

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.025
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:41.686
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.

01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:43.229
Oh, I've been drunk since
I've been back, Mom,

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:46.024
and nobody gave two shits until
this one got all bent out of shape.

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:49.740
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:55.284
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:59.959
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:03.549
We all do, Mavis.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.632
It's obvious you're having
some mental sickness,

01:15:06.794 --> 01:15:07.841
some depression.

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:10.006
You're very lonely and confused.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:14.177
So Beth made me invite you here,
even though I knew it was a mistake.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:16.186
I knew it.

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:21.980
You're lying.

01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:24.694
He's not.

01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:39.623
Well. What about now?

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:42.334
You hate me now?

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:44.165
Hm?

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:48.127
'Cause it should be easy,
'cause I fucking hate you.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.435
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:58.266
Mavis, honey.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:03.686
You know, I came back for you.
For you!

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.438
And I hate this town!

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:09.983
It's a hick, lake town
that smells of fish shit!

01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:11.822
But I came back.

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:17.536
I just wanted you to know that.

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:33.551
I screwed up.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:38.519
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.236
You're scaring me.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:56.028
I'm crazy.

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:00.874
And no one loves me.

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:04.082
You don't love me.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:06.964
Guys like me...

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.376
...are born loving
women like you.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:15.427
I went to Buddy's house.

01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:17.925
What happened?

01:17:25.432 --> 01:17:27.776
I ruined my dress.

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:41.658
Um... I'll get you...

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:43.952
I'll get you a shirt.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:47.455
No, I want yours.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:52.050
You want the shirt I'm wearing?

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:26.960
Hide me.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:48.565
It's OK.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.060
It's OK.

01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:49.660
Why Buddy'?

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:56.629
He's a good man. He's kind.

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:02.215
Are other men unkind?

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:08.638
He knew me when I
was at my best.

01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:18.072
You weren't at your
best then, Mavis.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.487
Not then.

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:24.737
You know, I saw you every day.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:32.000
You had this little
mirror in your locker,

01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:34.584
shaped like a heart...

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:40.173
...and you looked in that mirror
more than you ever looked at me,

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.514
and I was at my best.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:55.460
Good morning.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.792
Hi.

01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:01.003
Coffee?

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:03.085
Sure.

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:16.769
Do you still write those books?

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:17.933
No.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:21.062
The series is over.
It got cancelled.

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:26.108
I'm actually writing the
last one right now.

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:28.489
What happens?

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:32.243
I don't know.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:40.372
Hey, do you know this
girl named Beth?

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.587
She married Buddy
Slade from school.

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:45.844
Um, yeah. I know that Beth.

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:51.721
What do you think of her?

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.512
Um...

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:57.602
I... I...

01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:59.437
I don't really like her.

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:03.570
I mean, I think that you're
way prettier than she is.

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:10.035
What happened to your dress?

01:23:16.116 --> 01:23:18.869
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:20.413
Shit.

01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:22.581
What's wrong? What did I say'?

01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:28.587
I have a lot of problems.

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:32.516
Can't you get a new dress?

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:35.302
It's really difficult
for me to be happy...

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:43.732
...and then for other people,

01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:45.646
it just seems so simple.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:47.981
I know.

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:55.157
They just grow up, and they're so...
fulfilled.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:57.784
I don't feel fulfilled.

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.044
- Well...
- And frankly,

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:03.251
if you don't feel fulfilled with
all the stuff that you have...

01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:14.675
I need to change, Sandra.

01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:19.976
- No, you don't.
- What?

01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:23.688
You're the only person in
Mercury who could write a book,

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:26.273
or wear a dress like that.

01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:29.235
I'm sure there's plenty of
other people who could...

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:31.742
Everyone here is fat and dumb.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.527
Don't say that.

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:38.036
I mean, you think so?

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:41.668
Everyone wishes that
they could be like you.

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:45.122
You know, living
in the big city,

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:48.384
all famous and beautiful
and all that.

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:50.715
I'm not really famous.

01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:53.630
Well, you know,
special or whatever.

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:56.220
I mean, some days, when I
have a slow shift at work,

01:24:56.383 --> 01:24:58.351
I'll sit and think about you,

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:01.684
living in your cool apartment,
going out and stuff.

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:04.107
It seems really nice.

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:07.861
Yeah. But...

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:12.984
Most people here seem so
happy with so little.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:17.826
It's like they don't even seem
to care what happens to them.

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:21.288
That's because it doesn't
matter what happens to them.

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.249
They're nothing.

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.381
Might as well die.

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:35.305
Fuck Mercury.

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:46.774
Thank you.

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:54.529
I needed that.

01:25:57.778 --> 01:25:59.325
You're right.

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:02.328
This place blows.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.839
I need to get back
to Minneapolis.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:12.543
Take me with you.

01:26:13.543 --> 01:26:14.760
Excuse me?

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:17.927
Take me with you.

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:20.309
You know, to the Mini Apple.

01:26:22.469 --> 01:26:25.143
You're good here, Sandra.

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:27.061
Oh.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:42.698
Dolce.

01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:46.243
I'm so sorry.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:49.417
My baby. Come here.

01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:54.585
<i>Graduation turned out to be a
bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.</i>

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:57.470
<i>While honored to be the
valedictorian of her class,</i>

01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:59.723
<i>there was an unmistakable
air of sadness</i>

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:02.430
<i>over the sudden death
of Ryan Ashby.</i>

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:06.893
<i>Who could have imagined when Ryan and
his girlfriend set sail that day,</i>

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:09.934
<i>it would be the last time
anyone ever saw them?</i>

01:27:12.185 --> 01:27:13.232
Good boy.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:15.068
<i>Poor Ryan...</i>

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:16.573
<i>Lost at sea.</i>

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:22.863
They don't need those back.

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:26.617
You can put them in a
scrapbook, or whatever.

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:32.539
Just so you know, those doughnuts
are for Honors Members only.

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:05.993
<i>Kendal felt the weight of her high
school years lifting off of her</i>

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:08.579
<i>as she emptied out her locker.</i>

01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:12.246
<i>Sure, she'd think about
Waverley from time to time.</i>

01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:15.507
<i>Cheer squad, the debate team,</i>

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:17.918
<i>sneaking into the woods
for a drink after class.</i>

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:22.131
<i>But her best years were
still ahead of her.</i>

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:27.761
<i>Kendal Strickland was
ready for the world.</i>

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:30.806
<i>It was time to look
to the future.</i>

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.358
<i>A new chapter.</i>

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:36.736
<i>As she boarded the
train for Cambridge,</i>

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:40.490
<i>she took one last look at her
small town and blew it a kiss...</i>

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:46.538
<i>...thinking, "Life,
here I come."</i>
