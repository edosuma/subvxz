00:11.846 --> 00:13.223
See?

00:13.306 --> 00:16.476
Sweating and jumping.
This is what people do after a breakup.

00:16.559 --> 00:17.644
Absolutely.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.687
Ever since I accepted
that Barbara's gone for good,

00:19.812 --> 00:21.439
I started turning over a new leaf.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.484
Yeah, I mean...
So, you feel better with exercise, right?

00:24.567 --> 00:27.070
Oh, absolutely.
Plus these great owl tranquilizers

00:27.153 --> 00:29.113
I got online
from this guy named Johnny He.

00:32.909 --> 00:35.662
-I'm high, like, literally 20 hours a day.
-Oh!

00:35.745 --> 00:37.288
Plus, the gym is a wonderful place

00:37.372 --> 00:38.414
to meet people. Truly.

00:38.498 --> 00:40.333
[chuckles] Hi, there.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.210
Hey, here's the big honeypot, girls.

00:42.293 --> 00:44.420
Where's all my female honeybees?

00:44.504 --> 00:46.589
[Maria chuckles] Well, I'm excited.

00:46.673 --> 00:49.634
You know, 'cause finally
I can get to do the things

00:49.717 --> 00:52.553
I've been putting off because
I was in a relationship.

00:52.637 --> 00:53.721
-You know.
-Yeah.

00:53.805 --> 00:56.558
Just going to salsa clubs alone or...

00:56.641 --> 00:58.810
going to a cat show alone.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.938
Acknowledging the homeless,
on a regular basis, you know.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.732
-Embroidery, it's so beautiful.
-Mmm.

01:04.816 --> 01:09.112
And I've always longed
to be interested to do it, so...

01:09.195 --> 01:12.031
But those are things you don't do
if you're tied down.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.158
Absolutely.
I love everything you're saying.

01:14.242 --> 01:18.329
But it's probably because I can only hear
the blood rushing in and out of my aorta.

01:18.413 --> 01:20.206
Did I mention there's a little man
living inside my brain?

01:21.332 --> 01:22.750
-His name is Danny.
-[gasps]

01:22.834 --> 01:24.294
-Owl drink?
-[hooting]

01:25.503 --> 01:28.256
Bruce, are you sure you're in a condition
to handle my career?

01:28.339 --> 01:30.967
-Let me check with Danny.
-[bells chiming]

01:31.050 --> 01:32.135
Answer is, "Yes."

01:32.218 --> 01:34.095
As a matter of fact, the Abluvia people

01:34.178 --> 01:37.348
are looking for a new pitch woman
for their brand-new campaign.

01:37.432 --> 01:39.475
Oh, Abluvia? Is that... yogurt?

01:39.559 --> 01:42.145
Yeah, a delicious yogurt
with herpes at the bottom.

01:42.228 --> 01:43.354
That's disgusting.

01:43.438 --> 01:44.731
No. Just joshing.

01:44.814 --> 01:45.815
[chuckles]

01:45.898 --> 01:48.401
Abluvia is a medicine for people
with mouth herpes.

01:48.484 --> 01:51.487
Speaking of herpes, that chick
over there is checking me out.

01:51.571 --> 01:52.655
I'm gonna give her something

01:52.739 --> 01:54.407
-to really look at. Come with me.
-Okay.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.242
-Oh. Okay.
-Just help me...

01:56.326 --> 01:58.036
-...pull down these cables, okay?
-Yes. Okay.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.871
I wanna get the full extension.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.497
Okay. [chuckles]

02:01.581 --> 02:04.500
You know, love really is
like a child's prison.

02:04.584 --> 02:05.710
You hold on tightly

02:05.793 --> 02:08.003
and then you let go lightly.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.714
-Okay. [gasps]
-Wait a second!

[Maria] <i>I'm a pterodactyl.</i>

02:43.831 --> 02:46.334
[Scott] I don't understand
what I did to her.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.462
I mean, why isn't Maria taking my calls
or calling me back?

02:49.545 --> 02:51.964
Yeah, well, it's really hard
to understand Maria,

02:52.048 --> 02:53.674
you know, most of the time--

02:53.758 --> 02:55.968
She thinks you fingerbanged her
in the kitchen on Thanksgiving.

02:56.052 --> 02:57.887
-Fingerbang?
-Mmm-hmm.

02:57.970 --> 03:00.598
Why have I heard nothing
of this tale of fingerbangery?

03:00.681 --> 03:02.558
Because you're a third-tier friend
at best.

03:02.642 --> 03:06.312
Wait. I promise you,
I did not fingerbang anyone.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.856
And she did not like
how you scraped half your plate.

03:08.940 --> 03:10.066
Mmm.

03:10.149 --> 03:12.985
Okay, was it the plate scrape
or was it the fingerbang?

03:13.069 --> 03:14.612
So you did fingerbang her.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.240
See, I'm part Native American, so...

03:17.323 --> 03:19.283
my people are used to being raped
at Thanksgiving.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.035
-Look. I have big hands.
-Ew.

03:21.119 --> 03:22.703
If I'd have fingerbanged her
in the kitchen,

03:22.787 --> 03:24.205
you'd have felt it in the living room.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.748
Okay, I don't feel safe!

03:25.832 --> 03:28.000
Look, fuck-knuckles,
Maria's got a mind of her own

03:28.084 --> 03:29.836
underneath all that yellow hair.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.712
So, do you want my advice?

03:31.796 --> 03:33.714
-Yes.
-You gotta go see her.

03:33.798 --> 03:36.884
Bring her something she likes,
like one of those self-help workbooks.

03:36.968 --> 03:38.302
-[mouthing indistinctly]
-She loves those things.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.762
She loves checking 'em off.

03:39.846 --> 03:41.472
She can feel herself getting better.

03:41.556 --> 03:44.976
Then you could bring her
a case of LaCroix sparkling water.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.269
Don't bring her that <i>pamplemousse</i> shit.

03:46.352 --> 03:47.645
That's fucking disgusting.

03:47.729 --> 03:50.440
Oh, you know what?
And get her some pug shit.

03:50.523 --> 03:51.983
She loves those little fuckers.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.151
Great.

03:53.234 --> 03:56.028
Thanks, but if you talk to her,
tell her that I'll do anything,

03:56.112 --> 03:57.905
whatever it takes
to make this right, okay?

03:57.989 --> 03:59.198
You should have thought about that

03:59.282 --> 04:01.325
before you fingered
your relationship to death.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.785
That's not what happened.

04:02.869 --> 04:05.455
Don't you point that
rape stick at me, man.

04:07.498 --> 04:08.583
Thank you.

04:11.544 --> 04:13.588
I don't feel safe with him anymore.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.591
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
feel safe around me either.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.925

Hey, Bert.

Maria around?

04:35.985 --> 04:37.236
[Bert] It's late, Scott.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.989
And she doesn't want to see
your fucking garbage face.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.199
I don't get it.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.743
What did I do?

04:44.911 --> 04:46.704
Is this about the plate scrape
at Thanksgiving?

04:46.788 --> 04:49.999
[Bert] It's not my place to say.
But, yes, it was.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.877
And the fingerbang, and some other things.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.421
Among them, your general neediness.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.509
Hey, Bert! Dude, that's not cool!

05:00.593 --> 05:02.762
[Bert] No, I wasn't going to hit her.

05:02.845 --> 05:06.015
In dog language it means,
"I love you. See you in bed."

05:06.098 --> 05:08.226
But I think it's fucked up
that you went there.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.352
Good night, Scott.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.437
Let me talk to her for one minute.

05:11.521 --> 05:13.773
[Bert barks] In dog years
that is four days,

05:13.856 --> 05:15.483
and that is fucking ridiculous.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.193
-Good night.
-No, look, please...

05:17.276 --> 05:19.612
-No, tell her... I love her.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.673
Good job-job, Bert.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.342
[Bert] You're welcome.
My dear Maria, Scott loves you.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.678
-Why won't you talk to him?
-Because...

05:43.761 --> 05:47.348
I'm not comfortable with people,
places, or things needing me.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.892
When things need me, I let them down.

05:49.976 --> 05:52.853
Scott needs me. I'll let him down.

05:52.937 --> 05:55.982
[Bert] I need you.
And you've never let me down.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.401
That's not true, and you know it.

05:58.484 --> 06:01.404
[Bert] Oh, yes, there was that one time...

06:03.656 --> 06:05.116
[Maria] <i>I had been in Duluth</i>
<i>for six months,</i>

06:05.199 --> 06:07.785

<i>This was where I belonged.</i>

06:09.203 --> 06:11.205
[Maria] Mom,
I was wondering if, maybe,

06:11.289 --> 06:13.374
I could have my own space
inside my room--

06:13.457 --> 06:16.002
[Marilyn] No, we don't want you
to isolate yourself...

06:16.085 --> 06:17.628
-[Maria] Okay.
-'cause we want...

06:17.712 --> 06:19.922
-some family time with you.
-[Maria] Okay.

06:20.006 --> 06:22.425
[Marilyn] You know what I mean?
[Maria] Yeah.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.552
There's a fine line
between isolation--

06:25.720 --> 06:28.264
-What! Where's Bert?
-[Joel] Where'd he go?

06:28.347 --> 06:30.391
He was just here, snorting away.

06:30.474 --> 06:31.517
[Maria] He's gone!

06:31.601 --> 06:33.019
[Marilyn] Let's don't get in a panic.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.187
-I mean, how far can a pug go?
-[Joel] Exactly.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.982
[screaming] Checklist stole another one
of my pugs!

06:38.065 --> 06:41.444

-[Marilyn] Bert?

06:43.112 --> 06:45.656
-Bert!
-Where could that pug have gone?

06:51.370 --> 06:52.496
[Maria] Hi.

06:52.580 --> 06:56.167
I was wondering if I could put up
a flyer for my beloved, missing dog, Bert?

06:56.250 --> 06:57.460
Oh, sure.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.795
If you want, you can put one
in the break room, too.

06:59.879 --> 07:01.964
[Maria] Thank you so much. All right.

07:03.883 --> 07:07.261
Oh, I can't even look in the cages,
all these sad little eyes.

07:08.346 --> 07:10.473
Wait... Bert?

07:11.265 --> 07:13.601
[Bert] 'Tis I. I couldn't resist

07:13.684 --> 07:16.687
the pull of my true love.
[kisses] Lady pug.

than live on one's haunches.

It's him!

07:25.154 --> 07:26.238
You're not dead!

07:26.322 --> 07:28.282
[Bert] I've never felt more alive.

07:28.366 --> 07:29.659
Bert, you ready to go home?

[Bert] Not without my lover.

Oh!

07:32.453 --> 07:33.663
[Bert] This is my lover.

Bert, we can't take in another dog.
I can't be trusted.

07:38.334 --> 07:39.961
I killed Blossom.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.588
I can't take responsibility
for another dog.

you've been grandfathered in.

Don't you know, baby girl,
that if you hadn't killed me,

I would have killed you?

One of us was
not getting out of there alive.

09:12.678 --> 09:16.140
I admire you, actually.
You did what I could not.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.601
My paws were too tiny to pull the trigger.

09:18.684 --> 09:19.977
You had a gun?

09:20.061 --> 09:21.896
Of course. A Walther PPK.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.690
With a mother of pearl handle
and nickel plating.

09:24.774 --> 09:26.525
A lady pistol.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.986
I waited for you for hours to kill you.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.821
You did?

09:30.905 --> 09:34.408
But I had to make sissy and got distracted
by that delicious trash.

09:34.492 --> 09:35.534
Oh.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.374
If you had gone first,
I would have eaten you from the ankles up.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.169
The best woman won.
My bowler hat is off to you.

09:45.795 --> 09:48.798
Wait. Are you forgiving me?

09:48.881 --> 09:50.257
Not quite yet, human.

09:50.341 --> 09:52.843
Not until you return
to the scum-filled streets

09:52.927 --> 09:55.054
of the City of Angels where you belong.

09:55.137 --> 09:59.433
But I'm worried if I went back to LA...
[stuttering] I'd go mad.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.853
And I wouldn't be able to handle it,

10:02.937 --> 10:05.481
and I'd go crazy on the 405.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.775
[Blossom] Fuck the 405. Take Coldwater.

10:07.858 --> 10:11.737
Look, Maria, if you put fear behind you
and live life to the fullest,

10:11.821 --> 10:14.031
our karmic debt will be repaid,

10:14.115 --> 10:16.742
and you will no longer be my murderer.

10:16.826 --> 10:19.328
Do what I can no longer do, Maria. Live!

10:19.411 --> 10:21.288
Live, <i>mein liebchen!</i>

10:21.372 --> 10:23.499
Goodbye, my sweet Maria.<i> Adieu.</i>

10:23.582 --> 10:24.667
Live!

10:24.750 --> 10:27.336
-[Blossom echoing] Live!
<i>-Adieu!</i>

10:28.003 --> 10:29.088
[dogs barking]

10:29.171 --> 10:31.757
Holy shit,
I can't believe she would have eaten me.

10:32.925 --> 10:34.093
Oh, my God.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.803
Is that how you put the dogs down?

10:36.595 --> 10:38.139
Oh, no. We drown them in a bucket.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.891
I just use the shotgun
to keep their heads underwater.

10:40.975 --> 10:42.184
[Bert grunts]

10:42.268 --> 10:44.103
So you gonna take that other pug, too?

10:45.479 --> 10:47.940
Um... uh...

10:48.524 --> 10:50.901
-Uh...
-[Bert] Please, Maria! I need her!

10:52.945 --> 10:54.780
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

10:54.864 --> 10:56.323
Okay, cool.

10:56.407 --> 10:59.160
[Maria] Okay.
[Bert] I dub thee...

10:59.243 --> 11:00.619
Blueberry.

11:00.703 --> 11:04.331
Blueberry it is.
'Cause you're sweet, and small, and quiet.

11:04.415 --> 11:06.250
Just... like a blueberry.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.546
You know what, guys?
I'm gonna make a quick phone call.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.216
[cell phone ringing]

11:18.888 --> 11:20.639
[Bruce] <i>Salad department. Bruce speaking.</i>

11:20.723 --> 11:21.807
Hey, Bruce. It's Maria.

11:21.891 --> 11:23.475
Would you like to represent me again?

11:23.559 --> 11:24.977
[gasps]

11:25.060 --> 11:26.437
I'm coming home!

11:26.562 --> 11:28.272
Oh, yes!

11:28.355 --> 11:30.024
[Maria] <i>And that's how</i>
<i>I made it back to LA.</i>

11:30.107 --> 11:32.109
<i>I was really throwing myself</i>
<i>into my work</i>

11:32.192 --> 11:33.986
<i>and forgetting about my breakup </i>
<i>with Scott.</i>

11:34.069 --> 11:37.781
Oh, this is so funny.
Putting herpes on someone.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.784
-Normally, I'm covering these things up.
-[both chuckling]

11:40.868 --> 11:41.869
[Bruce] Maria!

11:42.703 --> 11:44.997
-[muffled] Oh! Hey, Bruce!
-[Bruce] How you doin'?

11:45.080 --> 11:46.415
Oh. Sorry.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.625
[clattering]

11:47.708 --> 11:49.043
-[cat meowing]
-Sorry.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.711
-Uh, listen...
-[Maria] Hey.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.881
Please. Uh...
Not a word about my current state, okay?

11:53.964 --> 11:55.633
Believe me, I've heard it all already.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.093
So, uh, how are you?

11:58.177 --> 12:02.097
Good! Yeah...
just glad to be working and...

12:03.307 --> 12:07.311
pushing down all the feelings
down, down, down, about the breakup.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.772
So, do you have anything for me?

12:09.855 --> 12:11.023
I got some great news.

12:11.106 --> 12:14.485
The bladder people, Quandranique,
are looking for another older woman

12:14.568 --> 12:18.030
for a spot where you walk around
holding hands with an animated bladder.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.074
-Lisa Rinna's already on board.
-Oh.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.325
They need you to play somebody who's,

12:21.408 --> 12:24.119
well, more than friends with her
at an outdoor concert.

12:24.203 --> 12:25.621
Yeah, of course. I accept.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.457
I have to say, Maria,
I'm really digging your enthusiasm.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.625
This is just great.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.461
I feel like we're really clicking
like never before.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.673
You're finally getting
the Bruce Ben-Bacharach plan for you.

12:35.756 --> 12:36.590
Take anything.

12:36.674 --> 12:37.591
[chuckling] Yeah!

12:37.675 --> 12:40.135
-Toot, toot!
-Toot, toot!

12:40.219 --> 12:41.220
[both chuckling]

12:41.303 --> 12:42.763
[serene music playing]

12:44.390 --> 12:45.641
I have herpes.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.101
And I still don't.

12:47.184 --> 12:50.980
[chuckling] Abluvia,
for the sexually active bicyclist.

12:53.107 --> 12:55.943
[director] Cut! Everybody, take five.
Everybody stay close.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.903
My herpes people,
if you're gonna drink anything,

12:57.987 --> 12:59.113
I need you to use a straw.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.532
-Can I get a water?
-[Maria] Huh.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.493
-We make a cute couple.
-[both chuckling]

13:05.119 --> 13:06.203
[crying]

13:06.286 --> 13:09.039
-Oh, my God! Are... are you...
-Yeah.

13:09.123 --> 13:11.166
-I'm so sorry.
-Fuck it. It's nothing.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.460
-I'm just... I'm a little...
-Okay.

13:14.712 --> 13:16.630
Just that thing you said
about being in a cute couple.

13:16.714 --> 13:18.007
You reminded me of my ex-girlfriend.

13:18.090 --> 13:20.884
-Oh.
-But she fucking broke up with me.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.219
Oh!

13:22.302 --> 13:24.596
I'm sorry. Oh! Fuck me!

13:24.680 --> 13:26.348
[sniffling] This is embarrassing.

13:26.432 --> 13:28.559
[stammering] But why did
she break up with you?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.352
That's the worst part.

13:30.436 --> 13:32.688
She never told me. I don't know why.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.024
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

13:36.025 --> 13:38.235
That's exactly what I just did
with my beloved.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.446
Oh, fuck! No!

13:40.529 --> 13:41.780
-Yeah.
-Why?

13:41.864 --> 13:43.741
It was our first Thanksgiving together,

13:43.824 --> 13:46.493
and I brought him
to meet all my friends...

13:46.577 --> 13:47.995
-So fraught.
-Right.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.872
-It's just full of tension, right?
-Thank you.

13:49.955 --> 13:53.250
[chuckling] It was like...
I felt responsible for him,

13:53.333 --> 13:56.628
and it's, like,
he was super clingy, and...

13:56.712 --> 13:59.173
He kind of fingerbanged me
in the kitchen,

13:59.256 --> 14:02.426
and I was like,
"Ooh, I don't wanna do this."

14:02.509 --> 14:06.764
You know, like, I'm gonna let him down.
Like I've let everybody down.

14:06.847 --> 14:07.890
Especially Blossom.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.349
Who's Blossom?

14:09.433 --> 14:10.976
[crying] My...

14:11.060 --> 14:13.020
My dead pug.

14:13.145 --> 14:14.605
Fuck, I'm sorry.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.399
I love pugs.

14:17.483 --> 14:19.485
They're the best. They don't do anything.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.278
-[chuckling] Exactly!
-At all! Right?

14:21.362 --> 14:23.530
-And it's enough.
-It's like... [grunting]

14:24.281 --> 14:25.991
-[snorts] Yeah.
-What is this?

14:26.075 --> 14:27.576
-They sit on things.
-[both laughing]

14:27.659 --> 14:30.871
-Fuck! I'm so fucking sorry.
-[groaning]

14:30.954 --> 14:33.082
-Fuck!
-Yeah, I made a terrible mistake.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.834
I sent the one good thing
in my life away from me...

14:35.918 --> 14:39.046
'cause I was afraid I...
I wasn't enough for him.

14:40.881 --> 14:41.757
Go to him.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.758
Okay.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.802
-And be a pug!
-[laughing]

14:44.885 --> 14:46.762
-Be a fucking pug!
-I am a pug!

14:47.679 --> 14:50.140
-'Cause it's enough!
-Oh, God!

14:50.224 --> 14:53.143
I'm going to my lover, Scott!

14:53.227 --> 14:56.855
I'm coming to fulfill our destinies!

15:03.570 --> 15:04.780
[Maria] Thank you.

15:04.863 --> 15:05.948
[Karen] Excuse me.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.658
-So sorry for your loss. And mine.
-Oh.

15:08.409 --> 15:10.869
I almost had Blossom
in a two-bedroom condo on Wilshire.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.037
-Oh.
-Miracle Mile.

15:12.121 --> 15:14.915
Now the only miracle is how I'm gonna
get that fucking deposit back.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.708
Blossom was moving out?

15:16.792 --> 15:18.544
Yeah, she was moving in
with her boyfriend.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.088
Fucking hot corgi named Josh.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.381
I thought Bert was her boyfriend.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.966
No, Bert's her husband. Sort of.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.677
I mean, they have a loosey-goosey
Kurt and Goldie type of thing.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.387
-Oh.
-Hey, what's the Wi-Fi password here?

15:28.470 --> 15:30.180
[crying] "Blossom."

15:30.264 --> 15:32.057
-Oh, that's a bummer.
-[groaning]

15:32.766 --> 15:35.102
Hey, why is there a Mountie here?

15:36.186 --> 15:38.439
Blossom had a dual
German-Canadian citizenship.

15:38.522 --> 15:40.023
How do you know that?

15:40.107 --> 15:43.402
I saw her passport when
I bailed her out of jail after that DUI.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.528
The second one.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.071
But she always got sick in the car.

15:46.155 --> 15:47.322
Yep, because she was shit-faced.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.658
This girl knew how to light it on fire.

15:50.451 --> 15:51.743
Oh, I'm getting upset.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.579
Fuck you, Blossom!

15:53.662 --> 15:54.663
[exclaims softly]

15:55.414 --> 15:56.665
Oh, okay.

15:56.748 --> 16:00.419
<i>Maria, my black heart</i>
<i>goes out to you. I mean it.</i>

16:00.502 --> 16:04.715
<i>From one person who has killed dogs</i>
<i>before to another, I know it's tough.</i>

16:04.798 --> 16:06.842
Yes, I know. Thank you, Karen.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.052
And I'm sorry that you couldn't make it.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.305
I'm here.
I was just freshening up my drank.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.806
Oh, okay.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.266
I know you've been dealing with bad news,

16:14.349 --> 16:16.059
so I'm gonna hit you with the good stuff.

16:16.143 --> 16:19.313
Checklist has upgraded your flight
to Business Coach Plus.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.064
A little more leg room,
a little less width.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.192
-Oh.
-Fuck you, Robert Downey Jr.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.527
I'm not talking to you,
you little shit lick!

16:26.069 --> 16:27.362
Robert Downey Jr. is here?

16:27.446 --> 16:28.655
-Yeah.
-The Ironman?

16:28.739 --> 16:31.033
Oh, yeah.
He was Blossom's AA sponsor.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.243
He's pretty torn up about the death.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.746
His dogs aren't, though.
They had a falling out.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.289
It's always about the fucking money.

16:37.915 --> 16:40.542
Speaking of money,
when you land in Minneapolis,

16:40.626 --> 16:43.795
you're gonna head straight to
the annual Checklist Check Down.

16:43.879 --> 16:48.050
And get ready to cream your jeans,
because Mark McGrath is gonna be there.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.760
-Oh, God.
-From Sugar Ray.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.261
Cream away. I'll wait.

16:51.345 --> 16:54.932
Meant to tell you, I...
I can't do it. I can't.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.141
"Can't" or "cunt"?

16:56.225 --> 16:57.476
Here's what they want you to do.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.686
You're gonna wheel out
the chairman of Checklist

16:59.770 --> 17:01.188
before the awards for regional sales.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.689
He mentally died 15 years ago,

17:02.773 --> 17:04.398
but they still parade his crippled,
rotten corpse

17:04.483 --> 17:05.483
in front of the shareholders.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.486
God, I fucking love corporate America.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.948
[grunting] Okay. So, fuck you.
You're doing it.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.574
Plane. Tomorrow. You.

17:12.657 --> 17:16.578
No. I don't feel good. I don't--
My dog just died!

17:16.662 --> 17:19.248
And I'm pretty sure
that Checklist is evil.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.582
-"Can't" or "cunt"?
-Yes.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.751
"Cunt." What are we talking about?
Someone read me in.

17:23.669 --> 17:24.711
Maria, I am so sorry.

17:24.795 --> 17:27.923
The best thing for grieving
is to do it with a group of strangers.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.091
Who are you?

17:29.174 --> 17:30.551
I'm Karen Grisham, your life coach.

17:30.634 --> 17:33.011
-We haven't met. I'm from the future.
-Oh, no.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.264
Karen Grisham, real estate.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.724
Also Karen Grisham.
You'll be hearing from my lawyers.

17:37.808 --> 17:38.976
[straining]

17:39.059 --> 17:40.185
You're fucked.

17:40.269 --> 17:41.311
You're fucked.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.729
-You're future-fucked.
-Hey.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.856
-[all laughing]
-Nice to meet ya.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.942
[screaming] I don't feel good!

17:49.111 --> 17:50.445
[laser zapping]

17:52.823 --> 17:54.283
[guinea pig] Hello.

17:54.366 --> 17:58.078
[clears throat] Hello!
I am the Super Grisham.

17:58.787 --> 18:02.165
Oh, Super Grisham... I'm so sad.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.500
I don't know what to do.

18:03.584 --> 18:04.751
[Super Grisham] Do you want my advice?

18:04.835 --> 18:07.087
Well, seeing as you're the combination

18:07.170 --> 18:10.132
of my three Karen Grishams
in guinea pig form,

18:10.215 --> 18:14.094
and you're also a hairy little golem
that represents my manic false engine,

18:14.177 --> 18:17.264
why would I have any reason
not to listen to you?

18:17.347 --> 18:20.434
You fear Minneapolis.
You need to face that fear.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.727
I don't think so.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.687
Do you fear letting people
finish their thoughts?

18:24.313 --> 18:25.397
No. No, I just--

18:25.522 --> 18:26.773
You're doing it. I had more.

18:26.857 --> 18:28.191
-I'm sorry--
-God!

18:28.275 --> 18:30.444
I want to slap you with my tiny,
tiny hands.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.778
In fact, lean down.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.031
[Maria whimpers]

18:34.114 --> 18:36.241
Maria, this is when you dig down deep.

18:36.325 --> 18:39.036
Your needle is on empty,
so I want you to go below the needle

18:39.119 --> 18:40.621
and come back all the way around

18:40.704 --> 18:42.914
to the other side to a full tank.

18:42.998 --> 18:45.083
-Is that even possible?
-Can I finish?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.044
Checklist is an evil corporation.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.713
They're the reason Blossom's dead.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.381
And they did lots of other bad things.

18:51.465 --> 18:53.383
Checklist killed Blossom.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.177
You want to take them down, don't you?

18:55.260 --> 18:56.428
More than anything.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.555
Then scoop me up, put me in your pocket,

18:58.639 --> 19:00.515
pack me a necklace made of Cheerios,

19:00.599 --> 19:04.311
and let's get our asses out to
Minneapolis-Saint Paul, the Twin Cities!

19:05.479 --> 19:08.482
From the cradle to the grave, baby!

19:08.565 --> 19:10.817
-[crowd cheering]
-Come on! Whoo!

19:13.236 --> 19:15.238
What's up?
I'm Mark McGrath from Sugar Ray...

19:16.031 --> 19:18.408
and I just wanna fly!

19:18.492 --> 19:20.869
-[applauding]
-Yeah! Come on!

19:21.662 --> 19:23.580
-You got it!
-[cheering]

19:23.664 --> 19:24.748
Whoo!

19:24.831 --> 19:28.168
Mark McGrath is such a...
such a powerful performer.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.295
He's bad, Maria. You need to kill him.

19:30.379 --> 19:33.882
Mark McGrath?
But he's... he's wonderful and kind.

19:33.965 --> 19:37.302
That's how the devil works.
By convincing the world that he's nice.

19:37.386 --> 19:38.512
Murder him now.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.639
No one is being murdered.
All I need to do

19:40.722 --> 19:44.768
is to tell people all the evil things
Checklist has done.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.520
Then I can kill Mark McGrath, right?

19:46.603 --> 19:49.940
No! No one kills Mark McGrath!

19:50.023 --> 19:51.483
Can I slap him around a little bit?

19:51.566 --> 19:52.651
No!

19:52.734 --> 19:54.194
And, ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado,

19:54.277 --> 19:56.738
I give you our favorite
Checklist check lady...

19:56.822 --> 19:58.407
[Super Grisham]
Just put me in your satchel.

19:58.490 --> 20:01.076
I'm going out there with you.
It's go time, baby cakes.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.661
Our very own cradle to the grave...

20:02.744 --> 20:04.788
-For justice.
-[breathing nervously]

20:04.871 --> 20:06.123
For Blossom.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.083
Miss "Sounds Good, Feels Right" herself.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.252
For Blossom! Okay.

20:10.919 --> 20:15.465
[Mark] Maria Bamford
and Checklist CEO Ray Banicheck!

20:15.549 --> 20:17.759
[cheering]

20:21.972 --> 20:23.473
Hey, everybody!

20:23.557 --> 20:25.892
[chuckles nervously]
Sounds good, feels right!

20:25.976 --> 20:27.436
-[laughing]
-[applauding]

20:28.353 --> 20:31.273
Maria, what do you think of
the fine Checklist people?

20:31.356 --> 20:33.483
-[muttering]
-All right. [chuckles]

20:35.235 --> 20:37.654
-Teleprompter. Read it!
-Oh. Yes.

20:37.738 --> 20:38.822
Uh...

20:39.740 --> 20:41.867
Hi, I'm Maria Bamford, and...

20:41.992 --> 20:43.577
here's a big Checklist welcome

20:43.660 --> 20:46.580
to all of our Checklist associates
all around the globe.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.582
<i>Hola. Bonjour.</i>

20:48.665 --> 20:50.584
Murder. Slavery.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.794
[sing-song] The great prices.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.880
-[feedback whines]
-[breathing heavily]

20:54.963 --> 20:56.047
Perfect. Keep going, baby!

20:58.383 --> 21:01.178
Checklist is a predatory company...

21:02.387 --> 21:07.934
that oppresses foreign labor in order
to give us artificially low prices.

21:08.018 --> 21:10.771
We are all complicit
in modern day slavery.

21:10.854 --> 21:13.106
I am a part of it, too.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.192
I'm the voice of Trabajito.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.694
I oppressed Mexican workers.

21:17.778 --> 21:21.114
I did! I was a part of an evil agenda.

21:21.198 --> 21:25.160
Checklist must be stopped,
and I am the person to stop it!

21:25.243 --> 21:26.495
Okay, get her out of there.

21:26.578 --> 21:27.662
Uh, Maria.

21:27.746 --> 21:29.206
-Okay.
-Let's go offstage for a little bit.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.124
-Get a drink or something. Oh!
-[blabbering]

21:31.208 --> 21:33.126
One of those LaCroix that you love.
I'll get you one.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.086
LaCroix yourself, you punk!

21:35.170 --> 21:36.963
Super Grisham was right!

21:37.088 --> 21:39.007
You are evil!

21:40.175 --> 21:41.384
[distorted] How did you know?

21:42.677 --> 21:47.182
Form of a Sugar Ray sugar beast!
[laughing demonically]

21:47.265 --> 21:50.644
Form of an Ultra Maria!

21:50.727 --> 21:51.686
[whooshing]

21:51.812 --> 21:53.063

22:14.042 --> 22:15.252
-Kick!
-Punch!

22:15.335 --> 22:16.336
Punch it again.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.672
-Give him a taste of his own diabetes!
-Yeah. Get it.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.382
Why are we scuttling?
Why are we scuttling still?

22:20.465 --> 22:22.425
-Go.
-I'm just gonna hit the big one.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.932
[sugar beast] I'm sweet!
You want me.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.976
You can't live without me!

22:31.059 --> 22:33.770
I'm everything you fear and desire!

22:33.853 --> 22:35.355
[Ultra Maria] I can live without you.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.190
You are a false god!

22:37.274 --> 22:38.984
[grunting]

22:42.862 --> 22:43.905
[sugar beast] Sugar blast!

22:45.282 --> 22:46.658
All the buttons.
Press all the buttons.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.493
-Press every single button.
-Yeah, I am.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.079
[grunting]

22:51.913 --> 22:53.290
[Super Grisham] Uh-oh.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.888
Hey. Who's the new girl?

23:08.972 --> 23:11.766
Maria Bamford. The comedian that
went crazy at the Checklist Check Down.

23:11.850 --> 23:12.726
Oh, yeah.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.270
-I saw the video on YouTube.
-There's a video?

23:15.353 --> 23:16.438
Yup.

23:17.606 --> 23:19.357
<i>-Yes!</i>
<i>-Thank you, Maria.</i>

23:19.441 --> 23:21.276
-Why?
-Thank you. Thank you.

23:21.359 --> 23:22.902
-It's all right. It's okay.
-Okay.

23:22.986 --> 23:26.740
[grunting] You're not my God, sugar beast!

23:30.493 --> 23:32.162
-[screaming]
-[woman] Medic!

23:34.247 --> 23:36.166
I don't think
that old guy's gonna recover.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.667
-You know what else won't recover?
-Hmm?

23:37.751 --> 23:40.962
Mark McGrath's reputation as a guy
who doesn't kill crippled old men.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.505
[both laughing]

23:44.382 --> 23:45.842
[Maria] <i>So that's how</i>
<i>I ended up in Duluth.</i>

23:45.925 --> 23:48.845
<i>It was a combination</i>
<i>of fear and mental illness.</i>

23:48.928 --> 23:51.640
<i>But I wasn't gonna let fear</i>
<i>and mental illness stop me now.</i>

23:51.723 --> 23:53.558
<i>I was going after my man!</i>

23:53.642 --> 23:54.851
I'm in France!

23:55.477 --> 24:00.065
I'm in 1950s Brooklyn. Oh! Ebbets Field!

24:01.524 --> 24:03.943
Who would've thunk I'm in Antarctica!

24:04.861 --> 24:06.780
Global warming!

24:06.863 --> 24:11.076
I'm a real-life newsie! Extra! Extra!

24:11.159 --> 24:12.952
I'm gonna fuck Scott!

-[fuse blowing]
-[glass shattering]

24:21.586 --> 24:23.129
[Scott] What the hell?

24:23.213 --> 24:24.422
[Maria giggling]

24:28.051 --> 24:29.302
-Maria?
-Yeah.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.306
[panting] Your power is out.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.767
Do you need someone
to help you turn it back on?

24:35.850 --> 24:37.852
Did you just cut my power?

24:37.936 --> 24:39.229
That's really goddamn dangerous.

24:39.312 --> 24:44.234
This is a huge romantic gesture,
like all those Nora Ephron movies.

24:44.901 --> 24:49.406
Listen, I know that you're angry at me,
and I made a huge mistake, Scott.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.282
But now I'm back!

24:51.366 --> 24:54.244
And we're together again.
Un-broken up.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.079
-Uh, so you're okay?
-Yes.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.539
Yeah, and then, automatically, I'm okay.

24:57.622 --> 24:58.748
-Yes.
-Okay, Maria,

24:58.832 --> 25:00.625
you put me through hell
this past week.

25:00.709 --> 25:02.502
What about my feelings?

25:02.585 --> 25:04.921
They should be happy feelings.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.965
Okay, well,
you can't just turn it on and turn it off,

25:07.048 --> 25:10.135
and expect me to be all
happy about it, you know.

25:10.218 --> 25:12.053
That's not how relationships work.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.680
You don't have to be so mad at me.

25:13.763 --> 25:14.806
I am mad!

25:14.889 --> 25:18.643
[shouting] I'm mad, too,
because you put your hand down my pants,

25:18.727 --> 25:21.563
and then you also were
really needy at Thanksgiving,

25:21.688 --> 25:23.940
and then you only scraped off
half the plate.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.900
What is-- Is that like an animal?

25:25.984 --> 25:29.654
Okay. I did not put my hands
into your pants.

25:30.405 --> 25:32.407
And okay, I was needy at Thanksgiving.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.285
But being around your friends
freaked me out.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.871
Okay. I didn't know that.

25:37.954 --> 25:40.039
No. You made conversation
a little hard to have,

25:40.123 --> 25:41.541
with the knee-jerk breakup.

25:41.624 --> 25:42.625
Okay.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.503
Well, I guess... we're over.

25:45.587 --> 25:50.592
I guess this is how... you have a fight,
and then it's... It ends and...

25:50.675 --> 25:54.888
I... I bid you <i>adieu...</i>
Sweet prince, <i>adieu.</i>

25:54.971 --> 25:56.014
Maria...

25:56.931 --> 26:00.477
You know you can have a fight
with someone and not break up?

26:01.436 --> 26:03.062
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

26:03.938 --> 26:07.317
You can't do it every day, but,
every once in a while, for sure.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.068
Even on holidays?

26:09.152 --> 26:10.570
Especially on holidays.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.948
Well, fuck you, then!

26:14.032 --> 26:15.784
[chuckling] Fuck you, too!

26:15.867 --> 26:19.996
[chuckling] So you're not...
You're not mad at me anymore?

26:20.079 --> 26:23.082
Nah... I love you.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.127
Oh, I feel sick!

26:27.253 --> 26:31.466
Blossom said to put my fear behind me...
and to live.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.093
Maybe this is what she was talking about.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.261
Nah.

26:36.179 --> 26:38.723
I think this is what
she was talking about.

26:38.807 --> 26:40.642
[both chuckling]

26:40.725 --> 26:44.020
-That thing isn't real, right?
-No. It's a prosthetic.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.605
[both giggling]

26:49.108 --> 26:50.360
Wow!

26:50.443 --> 26:52.695
-Blossom never kissed me like that.
-[both chuckle]

26:52.779 --> 26:54.864
-Look, I made you something.
-Oh!

26:56.157 --> 26:57.826
-Ready?
-Yes.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.247
[gasps] You painted my vision board.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.915
And I added myself into it.

27:03.998 --> 27:05.750
Is that your tax return?

27:06.543 --> 27:07.585
Yeah. I don't have much.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.796
-Oh, that's okay.
-Mmm.

27:09.879 --> 27:11.130
Is that number what I think it is?

27:11.214 --> 27:14.467
The 410?
That's my credit score.

27:14.551 --> 27:19.180
That is the most intimate thing
a man has ever shared with me.

27:19.264 --> 27:21.933
-Yeah, it's pretty low.
-It is ridiculously low.

27:22.016 --> 27:25.854
And I'm gonna help you get a handle on it.
With workbooks.

27:25.937 --> 27:27.397
-I'd like that.
-[laughing]

27:28.147 --> 27:34.028
I can't believe you painted yourself into
my vision board and drew me to you.

27:34.112 --> 27:35.697
Yeah. And then I drew a pizza.

27:37.282 --> 27:39.075
And that made me hungry,
so I ordered pizza.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.618
-Oh.
-[Bert] Pizza's here?

27:40.702 --> 27:42.078
Hey, Bert.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.915
[Maria] Oh! Bert, what are you doing here?
[Bert] I was watching the game with Scott.

27:45.999 --> 27:48.209
We've also gotten into craft brewing.

27:48.293 --> 27:49.544
Oh!

27:58.469 --> 28:00.930
