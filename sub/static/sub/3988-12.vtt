00:31.032 --> 00:33.023

00:39.290 --> 00:40.996
Come on.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.449

05:27.620 --> 05:29.861
( rattling )

05:41.800 --> 05:44.086
( hisses )

06:46.156 --> 06:47.896
I need a drink.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.746
No, I mean a real drink.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.912
As in alcohol.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.334
I've never had one.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.209
'Cause of my dad.

07:08.387 --> 07:11.800
But he's not exactly
around anymore, so...

07:17.187 --> 07:19.052
I thought we could
go find some.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.617
Okay.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.823
Well, enjoy
your snake jerky.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.802
Jerk.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.513
- ( growling)
-(gaspS)

08:19.833 --> 08:21.494
(thuds)

08:46.860 --> 08:48.725
( twig snaps )

08:57.121 --> 08:59.703
Beth: lthink
we made it a way.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.535
I'm pretty sure we got to go that way
to find the booze.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.996
- ( clanging )
- What the hell?

09:05.170 --> 09:06.626
You brought me back.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.334
I'm not staying
in this suck-ass camp.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.544
Hey!
You had your fun.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.631
What the hell is wrong with you?
Do you feel anything?

09:14.805 --> 09:17.137
Yeah, you think
everything's screwed.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.558
I guess that's a feeling.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.557
So you want to spend
the rest of our lives

09:20.728 --> 09:22.684
staring into a fire
and eating mud snakes?

09:22.855 --> 09:24.641
Screw that.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.557
We might as well
do something.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.396
I can take care
of myself

09:29.570 --> 09:31.777
and I'm gonna get
a damn drink.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.927
Golfers like to
booze it up, right?

10:02.561 --> 10:04.267
Come on.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.206
Might be people inside.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.289
(thunder rumbling)

10:29.630 --> 10:32.622
( rattling )

10:50.818 --> 10:52.149
Come on.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.311
(walkers snarling )

11:37.990 --> 11:40.276
(snarling )

12:30.918 --> 12:32.829
Why are you keeping
all that stuff?

12:35.255 --> 12:38.338
(banging on door)

12:40.427 --> 12:41.792
Come on.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.924
(water dripping)

12:49.102 --> 12:50.933
( bottle clinks )

14:09.850 --> 14:12.011

-(gaspS)

14:42.841 --> 14:45.002
(grunting)

14:59.107 --> 15:00.563
( panting )

15:00.734 --> 15:02.520
Thanks for the help.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.730
You said you could
take care of yourself.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.861
You did.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.645
( clock chimes)

15:53.286 --> 15:55.117
(ticking )

16:03.547 --> 16:05.503
( gasps )

17:00.228 --> 17:02.139
Help me take her down.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.929
It don't matter.
She's dead.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.439
It does matter.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.406
Here.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.825
( clock ticking )

17:32.385 --> 17:35.127
(clock chiming)

17:36.723 --> 17:38.259
Okay.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.561
(walkers growling )

17:44.731 --> 17:47.393
- Move.
- ( walkers growling )

18:34.197 --> 18:36.188
(grunting)

18:45.292 --> 18:46.782
( gasps )

18:48.795 --> 18:51.252
( panting )

19:10.066 --> 19:12.443
We made it.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.314
I know you think
this is stupid.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.028
And it probably is.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.739
But I don't care.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.995
All I wanted to do today
was lay down and cry,

19:26.166 --> 19:28.407
but we don't get
to do that.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.952
So beat up on walkers
if that makes you feel better.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.752
I need to do this.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.196
( glass shatters )

20:04.871 --> 20:06.702
Did you have to
break the glass?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.864
No.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.408
You have your drink yet?

20:11.586 --> 20:13.417
No.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.704
But I found this.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.838
Peach schnapps.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.219
- Is it good?
- No.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.634
Well, it's the only
thing left.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.086
Who needs a glass?

21:01.261 --> 21:03.217
(darts thunking)

21:28.037 --> 21:30.028
( Beth crying )

21:57.525 --> 21:59.641
Ain't gonna have
yourfirst drink

21:59.819 --> 22:01.559
be no damned
peach schnapps.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.028
Come on.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.755
Beth:
A motorcycle mechanic.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.884
- Huh?
- That's my guess.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.295
For what you were doing
before the turn.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.384
Did Zack
ever guess that one?

22:30.558 --> 22:31.968
It don't matter.

22:32.143 --> 22:34.179
Hasn't mattered
for a long time.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.515
It's just what
people talk about,

22:36.689 --> 22:38.520
you know,
to feel normal.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.854
Yeah, well, that never
felt normal to me.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.525
Found this place
with Michonne.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.366
l was expecting
a liquor store.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.532
No, this is better.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.013
What's that?

23:17.814 --> 23:19.645
Moonshine.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.399
Come on.

23:49.387 --> 23:51.298
( blows)

23:52.348 --> 23:54.464
All right.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.594
That's a real
first drink right there.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.103
What's the matter?

24:05.278 --> 24:06.859
Nothing.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.109
It's just...

24:10.283 --> 24:12.740
my dad always said bad moonshine
can make you go blind.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.367
Ain't nothing worth seeing
out there anymore anyway.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.289
That's the most disgusting
thing I've ever tasted.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.720
Second round's better.
( chuckles )

24:38.895 --> 24:40.385
Slow down.

24:40.563 --> 24:43.100
- This one's for you.
- No, I'm good.

24:43.274 --> 24:46.482
- Why?
- Someone's got to keep watch.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.234
So, what, you're like
my chaperone now?

24:48.404 --> 24:50.144
Just drink lots of water.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.359
Yes, Mr. Dixon.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.663
( chuckles )

25:00.833 --> 25:04.246
Who'd go into a store
and walk out with this?

25:04.420 --> 25:07.253
My dad, that's who.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.254
Oh, he's a dumbass.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.541
He'd set those up
on top of the TV set,

25:11.719 --> 25:13.505
use them
as target practice.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.511
He shot things
inside your house?

25:15.682 --> 25:18.344
It was just a bunch
ofjunk anyway.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.383
That's how I knew
what this place was.

25:20.561 --> 25:23.724
That shed out there,
my dad had a placejust like this.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.854
You got your
Dumpster chair.

25:26.025 --> 25:29.859
That's for sitting in your drawers
all summer drinking.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.894
Got your fancy buckets.

25:32.073 --> 25:33.904
That's for spitting
chaw in

25:34.075 --> 25:36.407
after your old lady
tells you to stop smoking.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.362
You got your Internet.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.706
(walker growling )

25:50.591 --> 25:53.082
- lt'sjust one of 'em.
- Should we get it?

25:53.261 --> 25:55.252
If he keeps making
too much noise, yeah.

25:56.681 --> 25:59.093
Well, if we're gonna
be trapped again,

25:59.267 --> 26:01.383
we might as well
make the best of it.

26:03.187 --> 26:06.099
Unless you're too busy
chaperoning, Mr. Dixon.

26:08.317 --> 26:11.901
Hell, might as well
make the best of it.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.405
Home, sweet home.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.832
So first I say something
I've never done

26:34.010 --> 26:35.796
and if you have done it,
you drink,

26:35.970 --> 26:38.086
and if you haven't,
ldﬁnk

26:38.264 --> 26:40.880
Then we switch.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.219
You really don't
know this game?

26:43.394 --> 26:45.601
I never needed a game
to get lit before.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.433
Wait, are we starting?

26:47.607 --> 26:50.189
- How do you know this game?
- My friends played.

26:50.359 --> 26:53.567
I watched.
Okay, I'll start.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.984
I've never
shot a crossbow.

26:58.159 --> 27:00.115
So now you drink.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.656
Ain't much of a game.

27:02.830 --> 27:05.947
That was a warm-up.
Now you go.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.285
I don't know.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.749
Just say the first thing
that pops into your head.

27:12.924 --> 27:15.336
I've never been
out of Georgia.

27:15.510 --> 27:18.877
Really?
Okay, good one.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.390
I've never...

27:24.560 --> 27:27.097
been drunk and did
something I regretted.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.483
I've done a lot of things.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.354
Yourturn.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.157
I've never been
on vacation.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.738
What about camping?

27:43.913 --> 27:46.905
No, that was just something
I had to learn, to hunt.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.199
Your dad teach you?

27:49.377 --> 27:51.242
Mm-hmm.

27:52.547 --> 27:54.458
Okay.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.178
I've never...

28:02.348 --> 28:04.680
been in jail.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.888
I mean, as a prisoner.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.607
Is that what
you think of me?

28:15.778 --> 28:17.109
I didn't mean
anything serious.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.692
ljust thought, you know,
like the drunk tank.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.733
Even my dad got locked up
for that back in the day.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.901
- Drink up.
- Wait.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.489
Prison guard.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.279
Were you
a prison guard before?

28:31.294 --> 28:33.000
No.

28:36.090 --> 28:38.081
It's your turn again.

28:42.513 --> 28:44.720
I'm gonna take a piss.

28:47.518 --> 28:49.725
- (jar shatters )
- You have to be quiet.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.727
Can't hear you!
I'm taking a piss!

28:53.399 --> 28:54.730
What, are you
my chaperone now?

28:54.901 --> 28:56.892
(urinating)

28:59.947 --> 29:01.278
- ( zipper zips)
- Oh, wait.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.235
It's my turn, right?

29:03.409 --> 29:05.400
I've never--

29:07.413 --> 29:08.914
never eaten
frozen yogurt.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.242
Never had a pet pony.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.908
Never got nothing
from Santa Claus.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.873
Never relied on anyone
for protection before.

29:17.048 --> 29:19.414
Hell, I don't think I've ever relied
on anyone for anything.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.799
- Daryl.
- Never sung out in front of a big group

29:21.969 --> 29:24.756
out in public
like everything was fun.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.297
Like everything
was a big game.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.892
I sure as hell never cut my wrists
looking for attention.

29:34.357 --> 29:36.643
- ( thuds)
- ( walker growling)

29:36.817 --> 29:39.069
Sounds like our friend out there
is trying to call all of his buddies.

29:39.236 --> 29:42.364
- Daryl, just shut up.
- Hey, you never shot a crossbow before?

29:42.531 --> 29:43.987
I'm gonna teach you
right now.

29:44.158 --> 29:46.114
Come on.
It's gonna be fun.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.527
We should stay inside.
Daryl, cut it out!

29:49.705 --> 29:52.196
- Daryl!
- Dumbass.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.866
Come here, dumbass.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.454
- Daryl.
- You want to shoot?

29:56.629 --> 29:58.585
- I don't know how.
- Oh, it's easy.

29:58.756 --> 30:00.292
Come here.
Right corner.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.627
Let's practice later.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.884
- Come on, it's fun.
- Just stop it.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.420
- Daryl!
- Come here.

30:09.767 --> 30:12.634
- Eight ball.
- Just kill it!

30:12.812 --> 30:14.643
Come here, Greene.
Let's pull these out.

30:14.814 --> 30:17.146
Get a little more
target practice.

30:20.403 --> 30:22.519
What the hell you do that for?
l was having fun.

30:22.697 --> 30:24.608
No, you were being
ajackass.

30:24.782 --> 30:26.818
- If anyone found my dad--
- Don't.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.483
That ain't remotely the same.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.993
Killing them is not
supposed to be fun.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.869
What do you want
from me, girl, huh?

30:33.040 --> 30:35.702
I want to you stop acting like you
don't give a crap about anything.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.003
Like nothing
we went through matters.

30:38.170 --> 30:41.037
Like none of the people we lost
meant anything to you.

30:41.215 --> 30:43.627
It's bullshit!

30:43.801 --> 30:46.668
- Is that what you think?
- That's what I know.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.211
You don't know nothing.

30:48.389 --> 30:51.096
I know you look at me
and you just see another dead girl.

30:51.267 --> 30:54.634
I'm not Michonne.
I'm not Carol. I'm not Maggie.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.598
l've survived
and you don't get it

30:56.772 --> 30:59.730
'cause I'm not
like you or them.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.108
But I made it and you don't get
to treat me like crap

31:03.279 --> 31:05.315
just because
you're afraid.

31:07.825 --> 31:10.612
I ain't afraid of nothing.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.195
I remember.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.370
When that little girl
came out of the barn

31:18.544 --> 31:20.409
after my mom.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.787
You were like me.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.586
And now God forbid

31:26.761 --> 31:28.843
you ever let anybody
get too close.

31:29.013 --> 31:31.846
Too close, huh?
You know all about that.

31:32.016 --> 31:35.099
You lost two boyfriends,
you can't even shed a tear.

31:35.269 --> 31:36.429
Your whole family's gone,

31:36.604 --> 31:37.593
all you can do isjust go
out looking for hooch

31:37.772 --> 31:38.887
like some dumb
college bitch.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.225
Screw you.
You don't get it.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.900
No, you don't get it!

31:42.068 --> 31:44.559
- Everyone we know is dead!
- You don't know that!

31:44.737 --> 31:47.228
Might as well be, 'cause you
ain't never gonna see 'em again.

31:50.034 --> 31:52.867
Rick. You ain't never gonna
see Maggie again.

31:53.037 --> 31:55.244
_ D '
aryl, just stop
- No! I

31:56.707 --> 31:59.198
The Governor rolled
right up to our gates.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.504
Maybe if I wouldn't
have stopped looking.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.710
Maybe 'cause I gave up.
That's on me.

32:07.885 --> 32:09.750
- Daryl.
- No--

32:14.558 --> 32:16.594
And your dad.

32:19.647 --> 32:22.639
Maybe-- maybe I could
have done something.

32:31.367 --> 32:34.029
(crying)

32:50.803 --> 32:53.215
| get why my dad
stopped drinking.

32:53.389 --> 32:55.801
You feel sick?

32:55.975 --> 32:57.511
Nope.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.515
| wish I could feel
like this all the time.

33:01.689 --> 33:03.429
That's bad.

33:03.607 --> 33:04.983
Hmm.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.982
You're lucky
you're a happy drunk.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.565
Yeah, I'm lucky.

33:09.738 --> 33:12.480
Some people can be
real jerks when they drink.

33:12.658 --> 33:16.276
Yeah, I'm a dick
when I'm drunk.

33:25.588 --> 33:28.330
Merle had this dealer.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.340
This janky
little white guy.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.592
A tweaker.

33:35.139 --> 33:37.505
One day we were
over at his house

33:37.683 --> 33:39.469
watching TV.

33:41.770 --> 33:45.513
Wasn't even noon yet
and we were all wasted.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.808
Merle was high.

33:48.986 --> 33:51.193
We were watching this show

33:51.363 --> 33:54.526
and Merle was talking
all this dumb stuff about it.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.907
And he wouldn't let up.

33:57.077 --> 33:59.033
Merle never could.

34:01.999 --> 34:04.411
Turns out

34:04.585 --> 34:07.167
it was the tweaker's
kids' favorite show.

34:08.589 --> 34:10.375
And he never sees
his kids,

34:10.549 --> 34:13.837
so he felt guilty
about it or something.

34:15.346 --> 34:18.759
So he punches
Merle in the face.

34:18.933 --> 34:22.175
So I started hitting
the tweaker, like, hard.

34:22.353 --> 34:25.015
As hard as I can.

34:25.189 --> 34:27.475
Then he pulls a gun,

34:27.650 --> 34:29.436
sticks it right here.

34:30.819 --> 34:33.151
He says, "I'm gonna
kill you, bitch."

34:33.322 --> 34:36.485
So Merle pulls
his gun on him.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.991
Everyone's yelling.
l'm yelling.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.572
I thought I was dead.

34:46.418 --> 34:51.003
Over a dumb cartoon
about a talking dog.

34:56.971 --> 34:59.087
How'd you get out of it?

35:02.017 --> 35:04.303
The tweaker punched me
in the gut.

35:04.478 --> 35:06.184
lpuked.

35:06.355 --> 35:09.939
They both started laughing
and forgot all about it.

35:14.029 --> 35:17.066
You want to know
what I was before all this?

35:20.786 --> 35:23.118
l was just drifting
around with Merle...

35:25.165 --> 35:28.293
doing whatever he said
we were gonna be doing that day.

35:34.091 --> 35:36.082
l was nobody.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.798
Nothing.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.974
Some redneck asshole

35:46.145 --> 35:49.808
and an even bigger
asshole for a brother.

35:56.864 --> 35:58.604
You miss him, don't you?

36:00.326 --> 36:02.988
I miss Maggie.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.947
I miss her bossing me around.
( laughs)

36:09.668 --> 36:11.954
I miss
my big brother Shawn.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.334
He was so annoying
and overprotective.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.339
( laughs)

36:19.887 --> 36:21.843
And my dad.

36:23.349 --> 36:24.964
lthought--

36:25.142 --> 36:27.758
I hoped he'd just live the rest
of his life in peace, you know?

36:31.857 --> 36:35.270
I thought Maggie and Glenn
would have a baby.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.775
And he'd get to be
a grandpa.

36:39.948 --> 36:43.361
And we'd have birthdays
and holidays

36:43.535 --> 36:45.617
and summer picnics.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.703
And he'd get really old.

36:54.380 --> 36:58.623
And it'd happen,
but it'd be quiet.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.632
It'd be okay.

37:07.851 --> 37:10.888
He'd be surrounded
by people he loved.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.559
( laughs)

37:29.373 --> 37:32.240
That's how unbelievably
stupid I am.

37:37.047 --> 37:39.254
That's how
it was supposed to be.

37:44.263 --> 37:47.426
| wish I could just...

37:47.599 --> 37:49.760
change.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.675
You did.

37:51.854 --> 37:53.719
Notenough.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.808
Not like you.

37:55.983 --> 37:58.895
It's like you were made
for how things are now.

37:59.069 --> 38:01.606
I'm just used to this,
things being ugly.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.317
Growing up
in a place like this.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.324
Well, you got
away from it.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.032
- I didn't.
- You did.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.039
Maybe you got to keep
on reminding me sometimes.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.200
No.

38:16.378 --> 38:18.915
You can't depend on anybody
for anything, right?

38:23.719 --> 38:25.755
- I'll be gone someday.
- Stop.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.465
|wi||.

38:31.143 --> 38:33.134
You're gonna be
the last man standing.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.939
You are.

38:45.657 --> 38:49.024
You're gonna miss me
so bad when I'm gone, Daryl Dixon.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.208
You ain't a happy
drunk at all.

38:55.375 --> 38:58.162
Yeah, I'm happy.
I'm just not blind.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.335
You got to stay
who you are,

39:04.510 --> 39:06.216
not who you were.

39:07.846 --> 39:11.179
Places like this,

39:11.350 --> 39:13.557
you have to put it away.

39:16.772 --> 39:18.103
What if you can't?

39:18.273 --> 39:19.774
You have to.

39:21.652 --> 39:23.859
Or it kills you.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.491
Here.

39:44.174 --> 39:46.335
We should go inside.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.927
We should burn it down.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.561
( laughs)

40:14.663 --> 40:17.325
We're gonna need
more booze.

40:17.499 --> 40:20.957

40:33.557 --> 40:35.639
J‘ There's bound
to be a ghost J‘

40:35.809 --> 40:37.891
J‘ At the back

J‘ No matter

J‘ That you're gonna find
really difficult to forgive... J‘

40:57.289 --> 41:00.201
- You wanna?
- Hell, yeah.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.592
J‘ There's gonna
come a day J‘

41:12.763 --> 41:14.754
J‘ When you feel better J‘

41:16.725 --> 41:18.966
J‘ Your eyes

41:19.144 --> 41:21.009
J‘ On that day J‘

41:23.065 --> 41:26.148
J‘ And float from branch

41:26.318 --> 41:28.730
J‘ Lighter than the air J‘

41:28.904 --> 41:31.816
J‘ Just when that day

41:31.990 --> 41:35.073
J‘ Who can say?
Who can say? J‘

41:35.243 --> 41:37.825
J‘ Our mother

41:37.996 --> 41:40.533
J‘ Ever since

42:01.478 --> 42:04.185
J‘ I'm gonna bribe
