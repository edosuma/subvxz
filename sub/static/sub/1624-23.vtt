[Tapping keys]

00:08.541 --> 00:09.607
Wow! Bummer, dude.

00:09.608 --> 00:11.242
You have a time machine?

00:11.243 --> 00:14.212
And somehow, it got programmed
to this crap diner?

00:14.213 --> 00:17.282
I must admit, I am
quite taken with steampunk.

00:17.283 --> 00:20.250
Oh, steampunk, right.
I remember that trend.

00:20.251 --> 00:21.818
It happened for,
like, ten seconds

00:21.819 --> 00:24.788
back in 2000
and-are-you-kidding-me?

00:24.789 --> 00:26.490
Dude, seriously,
you're sitting

00:26.491 --> 00:28.292
in a public place
tap-tap-tapping

00:28.293 --> 00:29.660
on an oldie typewriter?

00:29.661 --> 00:31.295
What are you?

00:31.296 --> 00:33.664
In the league of extraordinarily
pretentious gentlemen?

00:33.665 --> 00:35.799
Aren't you being
a little aggressive?

00:35.800 --> 00:37.400
Yup.

00:37.401 --> 00:38.401
That's how people are
here in the present

00:38.402 --> 00:39.902
where we live.

00:39.903 --> 00:41.304
But don't get me wrong.

00:41.305 --> 00:42.905
I'd like to go
back in time, too.

00:42.906 --> 00:45.675
Maybe stop 9/11 or that creep
who had sex on my shoe,

00:45.676 --> 00:47.142
but I can't.

00:47.143 --> 00:50.279
Present?
Where's that uniform from?

00:50.280 --> 00:51.847
Like, 1998?

00:51.848 --> 00:53.648
Oh, stop,
or I'm going to have

00:53.649 --> 00:55.317
to shoot you
with a Smith & Wesson

00:55.318 --> 00:58.320
I'm currently packing
in my bloomers.

00:58.321 --> 01:02.691
I'll go get thee a menu,
my good man.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.711
attention, everyone.

01:17.712 --> 01:20.047
Max and I have a little
late-night treat for you.

01:20.048 --> 01:21.882
Don't say it
all excited like that.

01:21.883 --> 01:24.685
Now when it's not drugs,
Earl's going to be pissed.

01:24.686 --> 01:28.054
You are invited
to a very important taste-test

01:28.055 --> 01:29.221
of Max's homemade cupcakes.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.090
Okay,
but I will have only one.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.259
When I get a tummy,
single ladies call me Buddha

01:33.260 --> 01:36.395
and rub me for luck.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.065
I gotta watch out, too.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.333
Last time I had Max's
chocolate espresso cupcake

01:41.334 --> 01:42.433
before going home,

01:42.434 --> 01:44.169
I was awake
till 5:00 A.M.,

01:44.170 --> 01:47.372
hand washing all my thongs.

01:47.373 --> 01:49.708
Thongs?
Earl, you devil.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.877
That's right, just because
there's snow on the roof

01:51.878 --> 01:54.445
doesn't mean there's
not swing in the sling.

01:54.446 --> 01:57.515
Oh, Caroline, darling.
Can you go back over there?

01:57.516 --> 01:59.283
I forgot my racing form.

01:59.284 --> 02:02.920
Oh, horse racing?
It reminds me of Chestnut.

02:02.921 --> 02:05.956
Max... Chestnut.

02:05.957 --> 02:07.558
What's with the sad face?

02:07.559 --> 02:10.259
Your horse is living it up
at a fancy stable nearby.

02:10.261 --> 02:13.297
Not gone to the great stud farm
in the sky.

02:13.298 --> 02:16.399
Did someone say
"stud farm"?

02:16.400 --> 02:22.105
My fee is $10 a quart or $15
if you want a boy.

02:23.908 --> 02:25.608
Wow.

02:25.609 --> 02:28.277
You bounced back from your
Sophie breakup pretty quick.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.745
It was not
a real breakup.

02:29.746 --> 02:31.880
I will have her
very soon again.

02:31.881 --> 02:34.083
Right now, I lay low
and wait in bushes

02:34.084 --> 02:37.119
like determined jungle cat.

02:38.654 --> 02:41.056
Or a rapist.

02:41.057 --> 02:43.658
Racing forms,
here you go.

02:43.659 --> 02:45.127
Earl,
maybe some time

02:45.128 --> 02:46.627
you will take me out
to the track with you.

02:46.628 --> 02:48.896
I used to ride horses
all the time in Korea.

02:48.897 --> 02:50.464
The mechanical ones
for a quarter

02:50.465 --> 02:52.333
in front of
supermarkets?

02:52.334 --> 02:54.769
Actually, Max,
I'm a very good rider.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.971
In fact, I was training
to be a jockey

02:56.972 --> 02:59.406
but was too short.

02:59.407 --> 03:02.743
Too short
to be a jockey?

03:02.744 --> 03:05.445
That's a hard hit,
my man.

03:05.446 --> 03:08.048
Han, I had no idea
you loved horses, too.

03:08.049 --> 03:09.816
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

03:09.817 --> 03:12.085
Well, why didn't you ever ask
about any of my interests?

03:12.086 --> 03:13.754
I'll tell you why.

03:13.755 --> 03:15.655
Because all you ever talk about
is "our cupcake business,"

03:15.656 --> 03:17.023
our cupcake business."

03:17.024 --> 03:19.358
Doesn't your cd
have other tracks?

03:19.359 --> 03:20.926
Anyway,
our cupcake business

03:20.927 --> 03:22.828
has a very important
meeting tomorrow

03:22.829 --> 03:25.030
with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

03:25.031 --> 03:26.498
I know
a party planner, too.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.834
He sells J .Lo.
and Salma Hayek Pinatas

03:28.835 --> 03:31.170
off back of truck
for Cinco de Mayo.

03:31.171 --> 03:33.972
Awesome.
Put me down for a Hayek.

03:33.973 --> 03:36.507
More storage space
for candy.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.377
Well, our party planner
is <i>the</i> it guy in Manhattan.

03:39.378 --> 03:40.678
And tomorrow,
Max and I are doing

03:40.679 --> 03:42.180
a tasting for him
at his office.

03:42.181 --> 03:47.351
How can someone be too short
to be a jockey?

03:47.352 --> 03:49.320
Isn't that
the whole point?

03:49.321 --> 03:52.790
Are you all right, Max?

03:52.791 --> 03:54.457
I got here
as fast as I could.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.193
Caroline texted me
to hurry over

03:56.194 --> 03:57.995
because you didn't know
you were pregnant,

03:57.996 --> 03:59.296
and you were giving
birth over toilet.

03:59.297 --> 04:03.133
So I grabbed
my plunger and ran!

04:03.134 --> 04:06.402
That is insane.
I never texted that.

04:06.403 --> 04:09.906
No, I did,
when I stole your phone.

04:09.907 --> 04:12.141
I needed a reason
to get Sophie over here.

04:12.142 --> 04:14.143
I can't believe
she believed it.

04:14.144 --> 04:16.678
Oh, come on, Max.
Giving birth over toilet?

04:16.680 --> 04:20.149
That is very you.

04:20.149 --> 04:22.417
Now that you are here,
Sophie, sit.

04:22.418 --> 04:24.519
I want to tell you
something important.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.387
Well, you can forget that.

04:26.388 --> 04:28.156
There's no way
I'm going to stay.

04:28.157 --> 04:31.592
A cupcake party?

04:31.593 --> 04:35.330
Oh, look, and this one
even has a pretzel in it.

04:35.331 --> 04:37.365
Yup, that's
our "salty n' spice"

04:37.366 --> 04:38.933
for our more
adventurous customers.

04:38.934 --> 04:41.235
Also for
the uptight white people,

04:41.236 --> 04:43.037
we have
the very, very vanilla

04:43.038 --> 04:46.573
which is... big surprise...
My favorite.

04:46.574 --> 04:48.709
And this is our beer-batter
maple bacon

04:48.710 --> 04:50.510
spring break cupcake.

04:50.511 --> 04:55.114
That's for stoners,
and big surprise, my favorite.

04:55.115 --> 04:57.416
We can only
take four flavors

04:57.417 --> 04:59.252
to represent
our cupcake business.

04:59.253 --> 05:04.557
See? Not one word ever
about anyone else.

05:04.558 --> 05:07.327
I have a pet ferret,
if anyone gives a damn.

05:07.328 --> 05:10.262
Well, I have
some big news

05:10.263 --> 05:12.464
I want to share with you
all as well.

05:12.465 --> 05:15.467
Sophie, that classy lady
right over there...

05:15.468 --> 05:19.872
[Muffled]
Mm, I like this one.

05:19.873 --> 05:22.207
She recently
broke it off with me

05:22.208 --> 05:23.641
because she wanted
to be with a man

05:23.642 --> 05:25.810
who had a dream
and a drive.

05:25.811 --> 05:28.246
So I have bought
a drive...

05:28.247 --> 05:30.114
A Lincoln town car.

05:30.115 --> 05:33.217
Yes, I have a new car service
and slogan:

05:33.218 --> 05:37.854
"Lie back and I will ride you
till you tell me to stop."

05:40.391 --> 05:43.960
So, oleg, you now have
a town car business?

05:43.961 --> 05:46.796
And Sophie,
you rent town cars all the time.

05:46.797 --> 05:48.731
Oh, oh, please.

05:48.732 --> 05:51.301
I mean, I love pizza, too,
but that doesn't mean

05:51.302 --> 05:54.870
I have to marry papa John.

05:56.806 --> 05:59.641
I was just thinking,
you might want to come out back

05:59.642 --> 06:03.478
and take a look at the light-up
makeup mirror on visors.

06:03.479 --> 06:07.082
Light-up makeup mirror?

06:07.083 --> 06:09.784
Oh, I might be interested.

06:09.785 --> 06:11.986
But not just you and I.

06:11.987 --> 06:14.188
Han will come as well.

06:14.189 --> 06:17.258
Finally! Han is getting
invited to something.

06:17.259 --> 06:19.193
Other than LinkedIn.

06:19.194 --> 06:21.930
- So much for the taste test.
- It's fine.

06:21.931 --> 06:23.798
I know what's best
for our cupcake business.

06:23.799 --> 06:25.565
I do say that a lot,

06:25.566 --> 06:27.200
but I think
it's kind of charming.

06:27.201 --> 06:28.268
I'll go get our coats.

06:28.269 --> 06:31.438
Mm, mm, mm.
Look at you.

06:31.439 --> 06:34.607
I must say, I'm impressed
with how far you've come.

06:34.608 --> 06:36.276
Well, you burn
a few thousand cupcakes,

06:36.277 --> 06:37.544
you're bound
to get better.

06:37.545 --> 06:39.679
Not just the cupcakes, Max.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.280
Look how far <i>you've</i> come.

06:41.281 --> 06:42.982
When I think of that girl
who came in here

06:42.983 --> 06:44.283
just looking to get by...

06:44.284 --> 06:46.385
Hey, and check you out now.

06:46.386 --> 06:49.989
Big, fancy meeting in Manhattan.
Lordy lord!

06:49.990 --> 06:52.058
- It's only a meeting, Earl.
- Maybe.

06:52.059 --> 06:54.560
But if you were
one of these horses,

06:54.561 --> 06:59.164
I'd put all
of my money on you, Max.

06:59.165 --> 07:00.832
Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

07:00.833 --> 07:02.300
Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

07:02.301 --> 07:04.202
Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

07:04.203 --> 07:05.770
- [Telephone rings]
- Poor kid.

07:05.771 --> 07:06.972
If I had that job,
I'd be asking someone

07:06.973 --> 07:09.074
to please hold a gun
to my head.

07:09.075 --> 07:11.476
He's probably excited
to be working for Paul Platt.

07:11.477 --> 07:12.843
Look at
all these magazines

07:12.844 --> 07:15.045
calling him
the next Martha Stewart.

07:15.046 --> 07:17.247
Someday, we'll have
articles about us.

07:17.248 --> 07:18.748
You know,
pictures of you and me

07:18.749 --> 07:19.749
standing outside
our country home.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.318
Hold on.

07:21.319 --> 07:25.055
We're rich and still
living together?

07:25.056 --> 07:27.224
Okay, she's leaving.
This is us.

07:27.225 --> 07:28.891
About time.

07:28.892 --> 07:30.793
Been sitting here so long
my ass is asleep,

07:30.794 --> 07:34.197
which kind of goes against
my theory that it won't quit.

07:34.198 --> 07:36.599
Hi, Paul's going to be
a little longer.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.766
It's fine.
It's just...

07:37.767 --> 07:39.268
Paul Platt parties,
please hold.

07:39.269 --> 07:40.436
- Paul Platt parties...
- How much longer...

07:40.437 --> 07:43.439
- Please hold.
- Me or them?

07:43.440 --> 07:45.474
I got the ass
pins and needles.

07:45.475 --> 07:47.876
- Max.
- What? We're on hold.

07:47.877 --> 07:50.912
Have a seat.
Five more minutes.

07:50.913 --> 07:51.913
[Sighs]
[Phone rings]

07:51.914 --> 07:53.482
Paul Platt parties.

07:53.483 --> 07:54.716
The word "party"
at a party planner's?

07:54.717 --> 07:56.251
Little obvious.

07:56.252 --> 08:00.954
Like me having art that says
"will die alone."

08:00.955 --> 08:02.589
Wait.

08:02.590 --> 08:04.625
I think this is Johnny's art.
No way.

08:04.626 --> 08:07.194
"No way" is right.
Johnny's a nobody.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.430
Paul Platt wouldn't have
a framed "Johnny" in his office.

08:09.431 --> 08:12.033
Look, signed "j. Peg."
That's his tag.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.001
Yo, what's the deal
with this art?

08:14.002 --> 08:15.536
It's a street artist.

08:15.537 --> 08:16.602
Everyone's getting
really into him now.

08:16.603 --> 08:18.138
Oh, yeah?

08:18.139 --> 08:22.642
He was trying to get into me
a few months ago.

08:22.643 --> 08:24.277
It was more emotional
than that.

08:24.278 --> 08:26.212
He cheated on
his girlfriend with her

08:26.213 --> 08:27.480
and then blew her off.

08:27.481 --> 08:29.482
It was really hard
for us.

08:29.483 --> 08:31.284
And you thought
me slapping my ass

08:31.285 --> 08:34.153
in front of him
was inappropriate?

08:34.154 --> 08:37.722
- Wow, Johnny made it.
- Well, good for him.

08:37.722 --> 08:39.357
He's making it,
we're making it...

08:39.359 --> 08:40.659
We're making it?

08:40.659 --> 08:43.062
I magic-markered
over the scuffs on my boot,

08:43.063 --> 08:44.563
and we can't
even get past

08:44.564 --> 08:47.799
the poor man's John Cusack
over there.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.034
Max, we <i>are</i> making it.

08:50.035 --> 08:51.635
We've come a long way.

08:51.636 --> 08:52.836
We haven't used
Starbucks napkins

08:52.837 --> 08:55.106
for toilet paper
in months.

08:55.107 --> 08:56.674
And now,
look where we are.

08:56.675 --> 08:59.177
We've got a meeting
with Paul Platt.

08:59.178 --> 09:01.512
Say it:
"We're making it."

09:01.513 --> 09:03.314
I'm serious.
Say it, Max.

09:03.315 --> 09:04.414
We are making it.

09:04.415 --> 09:06.015
Okay, we're making it.

09:06.016 --> 09:09.519
- Caroline channing.
- This is us!

09:09.520 --> 09:13.090
- Ahh.
- What, five more minutes?

09:13.091 --> 09:15.192
Monday at 4:00.
Something came up.

09:15.193 --> 09:17.327
Oh, okay.
Well, Monday at 4:00.

09:17.328 --> 09:19.028
There's no Monday at 4:00.

09:19.029 --> 09:21.163
He said Monday at 4:00.
Monday at 4:00, right?

09:21.164 --> 09:23.031
Absolutely.
Monday at 4:00.

09:23.032 --> 09:25.601
[Whispers]
There is no Monday at 4:00.

09:25.602 --> 09:28.104
I'm confused.
Is there a Monday at 4:00?

09:28.105 --> 09:30.473
In the books, Monday at 4:00.
Paul can't wait.

09:30.474 --> 09:33.075
There is
no Monday at 4:00.

09:33.076 --> 09:36.044
I don't understand.
Are we coming in Monday at 4:00?

09:36.045 --> 09:38.045
Absolutely.
Paul's a big fan.

09:38.046 --> 09:41.149
[Whispers]
Don't come in on Monday.

09:41.150 --> 09:43.618
Can you please tell me
what's going on?

09:43.619 --> 09:46.721
See, it's this news
about your father being moved

09:46.722 --> 09:49.491
to a cushy white collar
prison this week.

09:49.492 --> 09:51.259
Paul can't have anything to do
with someone named channing,

09:51.260 --> 09:54.060
'cause everyone
in New York is pissed.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.498
Look at all that.
It never stops.

09:57.499 --> 09:59.299
How much more of this
do I have to take?

09:59.300 --> 10:00.700
So we'll see you
on Monday!

10:00.701 --> 10:03.203
[Whispers]
Don't come.

10:03.204 --> 10:05.539
I woke my ass up
for this?

10:09.187 --> 10:13.056
Mmm.
This was delicious, Max.

10:13.057 --> 10:15.425
Here's a $20.
Keep the change.

10:15.426 --> 10:16.894
What are you doing,
Sophie?

10:16.895 --> 10:18.495
You don't pay
for the cupcakes.

10:18.496 --> 10:20.097
No, take it
for your business.

10:20.098 --> 10:23.432
Ever since your big
party planner meeting went bust,

10:23.433 --> 10:24.934
I was worried
that you two girls

10:24.935 --> 10:27.636
might form
a joint suicide pact.

10:29.606 --> 10:33.109
Nah, we're
not that organized.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.611
So how's Caroline today?

10:35.612 --> 10:37.712
She's handling it all
better than I thought.

10:37.713 --> 10:39.214
She's with her father's
lawyer right now,

10:39.215 --> 10:40.982
trying to figure out
the best time for her

10:40.983 --> 10:42.784
to go out to the prison
to see him before he's moved.

10:42.785 --> 10:43.785
[Cell phone chimes]

10:43.786 --> 10:47.222
Oh, that is my new phone.

10:47.223 --> 10:51.960
You know there's a phone
stuck to that gay furby, right?

10:51.961 --> 10:55.529
Yes, this is from my
favorite store on 14th street,

10:55.530 --> 10:57.697
rhinestoned.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.866
Oh, it's just a text
from my driver.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.268
He's waiting out front.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.503
Why don't you
just invite oleg inside?

11:03.504 --> 11:06.440
I'm not sure yet
he deserves to come inside.

11:06.441 --> 11:09.642
Well, from what I heard,
he's already come inside.

11:09.643 --> 11:11.744
[Laughs]

11:11.745 --> 11:15.181
Oh, Max, I love it
when you're dirty!

11:15.182 --> 11:17.183
Hey, how'd it go?

11:17.184 --> 11:18.884
Well, according
to my father's lawyer,

11:18.885 --> 11:21.020
the prison is surrounded
by so much press

11:21.021 --> 11:22.288
that daddy doesn't want me
to come out there

11:22.289 --> 11:23.756
and be exploited
all over again.

11:23.757 --> 11:26.458
Why is he still
the only news story out there?

11:26.459 --> 11:28.927
Well, the good news is,

11:28.928 --> 11:31.997
your hair
is especially shiny today.

11:31.998 --> 11:34.099
It is?
Thanks, Sophie.

11:34.100 --> 11:36.901
So try not
to kill yourself.

11:36.902 --> 11:40.339
Well, if I didn't kill myself
reading these in the car,

11:40.340 --> 11:42.440
I won't.
Hate mail.

11:42.441 --> 11:44.641
It was being held
at my old P.O. box.

11:44.642 --> 11:47.078
My father's lawyer
picked it up for me.

11:47.079 --> 11:49.880
Why didn't he just punch you
in the face and call it a day?

11:49.881 --> 11:52.083
I know, it's like the end of
<i>miracle on 34th street,</i>

11:52.084 --> 11:54.618
only everyone's
calling me a bitch.

11:54.619 --> 11:58.021
Oh, come on, not everyone
is calling you a bitch.

11:58.022 --> 12:01.591
"Dear bitch,
I hate you."

12:01.592 --> 12:05.094
"If I ever see you
on the street, I will..."

12:05.095 --> 12:07.329
Shake your hand
and wish you well,

12:07.330 --> 12:09.632
as you have been through
so very much.

12:09.633 --> 12:11.333
That is not
what that says.

12:11.334 --> 12:12.835
It might be.

12:12.836 --> 12:13.970
It's hard to read
his actual words,

12:13.971 --> 12:15.671
as they are
written in blood.

12:15.672 --> 12:19.775
Oh, look how fancy.
This is not hate mail.

12:19.776 --> 12:24.880
No, this is invitation to
metropolitan museum annual gala.

12:24.881 --> 12:26.481
It is?

12:26.482 --> 12:29.050
This is my favorite social event
in all of New York.

12:29.051 --> 12:31.553
I've gone every year
since I was 18.

12:31.554 --> 12:32.821
It's a fashion ball
at the museum of art...

12:32.822 --> 12:34.489
Yeah, I know
what it is.

12:34.490 --> 12:36.491
- I catered it last year.
- Max, how weird.

12:36.492 --> 12:38.559
We were probably
right in the very same room.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.629
Then there's a good chance
I spit in your drink.

12:41.630 --> 12:44.532
Not really, unless you were
acting all prissy and demanding.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.867
There's a good chance
you spit in my drink.

12:46.868 --> 12:50.571
Well, see?
This is happy news.

12:50.572 --> 12:53.205
No, as much as I want to,
I can't go.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.574
Everybody hates me.

12:54.575 --> 12:57.209
And much worse,
I have nothing to wear,

12:57.210 --> 13:00.346
and if you're gonna be hated,
you better look damn good.

13:00.347 --> 13:04.216
I give up. That invitation
finally broke me.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.118
Why are you
pulling down your bed?

13:06.119 --> 13:08.320
Because I don't have
a door to slam.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.155
Hell, I don't even
have a door!

13:10.156 --> 13:12.190
Everything's
been taken away, Max...

13:12.191 --> 13:14.225
My fortune,
my business career,

13:14.226 --> 13:16.595
my social life,
my sweet, sweet horse.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.997
Okay, take a nap.
You're upset.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.198
You have
a good reason to be.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.067
<i>A</i> good reason?

13:22.068 --> 13:25.836
I say she has
200, 300 good reasons.

13:25.837 --> 13:27.171
I mean, read these.

13:27.172 --> 13:30.174
These are like
letters to the devil.

13:30.175 --> 13:34.244
I'm just going to get in there
and never get out.

13:34.245 --> 13:36.346
Close it up, Max.
Put me in the wall.

13:36.347 --> 13:38.749
No, it's really hard to
close it when you're in there.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.350
I've tried.

13:40.351 --> 13:42.719
Look, I know
it's not even remotely close

13:42.720 --> 13:44.054
to what you had before,

13:44.055 --> 13:45.622
but we do have
our cupcake business

13:45.623 --> 13:49.893
and our purple stove,
and we do have $922.

13:49.894 --> 13:51.260
And we're gonna make it.

13:51.261 --> 13:55.264
Wall me.

13:55.265 --> 14:00.703
Come on, all you need
is a big, glamorous party.

14:00.704 --> 14:02.638
I mean, look at
all the celebrities

14:02.639 --> 14:05.708
that are on the list:
Martha Stewart,

14:05.709 --> 14:07.576
Justin Timberlake...

14:07.577 --> 14:10.445
[Gasps]
Ooh, Hugh Jackman!

14:10.446 --> 14:12.581
Oh, I like to call him
"huge" Jackman,

14:12.582 --> 14:15.316
because I bet
he has a big penis.

14:15.317 --> 14:19.053
Wall me.

14:23.892 --> 14:27.795
- [Horn honks]
- Thank you, sir.

14:27.796 --> 14:30.030
Welcome home, buddy.

14:30.031 --> 14:32.165
As you can see,
we haven't put the pool in yet.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.667
We'll get to it.

14:33.668 --> 14:36.637
Tree, grill, shovel...
Usual cast of characters.

14:36.638 --> 14:39.106
Now, I am going
to take you in to her,

14:39.107 --> 14:40.507
but I should warn you.

14:40.508 --> 14:42.743
She hasn't been
out of bed for two days,

14:42.744 --> 14:45.811
and that means no tooth brushing
and it's bad up in there.

14:45.812 --> 14:47.647
I'm pretty sure horses
have a keen sense of smell,

14:47.648 --> 14:49.148
so just be prepared.

14:49.149 --> 14:51.017
[Chestnut whickers]

14:51.018 --> 14:53.819
I missed you, too.

14:53.820 --> 14:56.321
- [Hoofbeats approaching]
- [Groans]

14:56.322 --> 15:00.792
Max, I'm trying to sleep.
Take your boots off.

15:00.793 --> 15:03.161
Caroline,
I have something for you.

15:03.162 --> 15:06.330
Go away.
I'm dead.

15:06.331 --> 15:10.434
Jeez, and you said
my breath was bad.

15:10.435 --> 15:12.937
You have a visitor,
someone you love.

15:12.938 --> 15:14.706
- [Chestnut whickers]
- [Gasps]

15:14.707 --> 15:19.543
Chestnut!
Chestnut, hi, baby, hi.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.278
How did he get here?

15:21.279 --> 15:22.813
I went to peach
and told her

15:22.814 --> 15:24.014
it was a matter
of life and death

15:24.015 --> 15:25.515
and we had
to have him back.

15:25.516 --> 15:27.551
And what,
she just gave him back to you?

15:27.552 --> 15:30.320
Well, I did have to agree
to come back and babysit

15:30.321 --> 15:32.322
one day a week
for the rest of my life,

15:32.323 --> 15:34.523
but hell, Chestnut's home.

15:34.524 --> 15:37.226
Max, thank you so much.
You brought me back to life.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.861
Oh, my God,
don't exhale on me.

15:38.862 --> 15:41.463
Your breath is like you
went down on a brussels sprout.

15:41.464 --> 15:43.700
Tip your head that way.

15:43.701 --> 15:46.135
[Baby voice]
Chestnut, Chestnut.

15:46.136 --> 15:48.037
Don't breathe
on him either!

15:48.038 --> 15:51.073
His whole head is a nose.
He can't handle that.

15:51.074 --> 15:54.810
Chestnut's home.
[Coos]

15:58.409 --> 15:59.509
Han, I'm so excited.

15:59.510 --> 16:00.876
Did you hear
my horse is back?

16:00.877 --> 16:03.245
This is
not conversation.

16:03.246 --> 16:05.247
This is just
the other thing you say.

16:05.248 --> 16:07.015
"My cupcake business,
my horse,

16:07.016 --> 16:09.484
my horse,
my cupcake business."

16:09.485 --> 16:10.818
Well, in case
anyone's interested,

16:10.819 --> 16:13.955
my ferret's name
is Alvin.

16:13.956 --> 16:15.390
And Alvin's
telling his friends

16:15.391 --> 16:18.992
he has a pet named han.

16:18.993 --> 16:20.994
Hey, Earl.
Long time, no see.

16:20.995 --> 16:23.564
Well, well, well,
Johnny.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.499
If it isn't
the famous street artist.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.934
Well, I'm hardly famous.

16:26.935 --> 16:28.235
You got that right.

16:28.236 --> 16:31.738
My remark was
laced with sarcasm.

16:31.739 --> 16:34.274
Can you tell Max
I'm here?

16:34.275 --> 16:37.277
That depends.
Are you still a two-timing bum?

16:37.278 --> 16:40.547
That's his name,
don't wear it out.

16:40.548 --> 16:41.948
Hiya, slugger.

16:41.949 --> 16:45.017
Can you do me a favor
and call Earl off?

16:45.018 --> 16:47.487
I may be on day six
of my p90x,

16:47.488 --> 16:50.422
but I'm in no shape to take on
a heavyweight like him.

16:50.423 --> 16:53.158
[Clears throat]
It's okay, Earl, we're cool.

16:53.159 --> 16:55.594
Well, I am.
He's just riding my fumes.

16:55.595 --> 16:57.762
So, uh,
where's your section?

16:57.763 --> 17:02.396
- Counter.
- Hm, same ol', same ol'.

17:05.471 --> 17:06.770
Johnny's in the diner.

17:06.771 --> 17:09.107
Why is he here?
It can't be to eat.

17:09.108 --> 17:11.976
He's "made it."
He eats "made it food" now.

17:11.977 --> 17:14.545
Well, obviously,
he's here to see you.

17:14.546 --> 17:17.080
Or else he won the award for
biggest lying jerk in New York,

17:17.082 --> 17:19.483
and this is the first stop
on his press tour.

17:19.484 --> 17:20.484
Well, I don't know
why he's here,

17:20.486 --> 17:22.185
but you better
come with me.

17:22.185 --> 17:24.221
He looks really good,
so I'm not listening

17:24.222 --> 17:26.856
to a thing coming out of
his pretty mouth.

17:28.392 --> 17:30.227
Well, I was gonna
ask what the specials were,

17:30.228 --> 17:31.894
but you know what?
Can I actually just get

17:31.895 --> 17:33.263
one of Max's
homemade cupcakes?

17:33.264 --> 17:36.266
- Okay, which flavor?
- Surprise me.

17:36.267 --> 17:39.034
Kind of like how you surprised
her with your girlfriend?

17:39.035 --> 17:42.171
Okay, I'm starting
to get a vibe here,

17:42.172 --> 17:44.140
and that's why I came in,
because I feel bad,

17:44.141 --> 17:46.675
the way things
went down between us,

17:46.676 --> 17:49.077
and I came to say good-bye
because I'm moving.

17:49.078 --> 17:51.079
Oh, moving.
To where?

17:51.080 --> 17:53.748
- Manhattan.
- Manhattan?

17:53.749 --> 17:55.883
That hardly calls
for a good-bye speech.

17:55.884 --> 17:57.885
It's over there.

17:57.886 --> 18:00.021
Yeah, I know,
but it's a big change for me,

18:00.022 --> 18:01.088
and we're not going
to be rolling

18:01.089 --> 18:02.757
in the same circles
anymore,

18:02.758 --> 18:07.094
and I'm getting married...
Over there.

18:07.095 --> 18:09.763
Well, at least you and
your girlfriend worked it out.

18:09.764 --> 18:11.131
Actually, we broke up.

18:11.132 --> 18:14.368
This is someone
I met a couple months ago.

18:15.537 --> 18:17.670
I was only
watching his lips,

18:17.671 --> 18:22.475
but did they just say
what I think they said?

18:22.476 --> 18:25.077
Well, there's your cupcake.
That'll be $5.

18:25.078 --> 18:28.548
The price has gone up.
Yeah, we're successful now.

18:28.549 --> 18:31.551
In fact, we may be working
with Martha Stewart.

18:31.552 --> 18:33.818
Caroline knows her
from, you know, before.

18:33.819 --> 18:35.953
We're gonna talk it over
with her

18:35.954 --> 18:38.623
at the met gala ball
that Caroline got invited to.

18:38.624 --> 18:40.725
Martha's on the committee.
Caroline goes every year.

18:40.726 --> 18:42.527
Not a big deal.

18:42.528 --> 18:44.429
My first time.
Not a big deal either.

18:44.430 --> 18:45.830
In fact, none of it's
a big deal,

18:45.831 --> 18:48.132
just two girls
who are making it

18:48.133 --> 18:51.735
but who choose to stay
in Brooklyn 'cause we're cool.

18:51.736 --> 18:54.104
That's awesome, Max.
That's awesome.

18:54.105 --> 18:55.673
It's just funny,
because whenever I think of you,

18:55.674 --> 18:59.976
I think of you in this diner
in that uniform.

18:59.977 --> 19:01.712
In a good way.

19:05.349 --> 19:06.816
You want money now?

19:06.817 --> 19:08.751
Yeah.
It's business.

19:08.752 --> 19:11.554
It's not like we had
a relationship or anything.

19:11.555 --> 19:12.955
In fact,
you can pay Caroline.

19:12.956 --> 19:14.990
She's the money.
I'm the artist.

19:16.993 --> 19:20.263
You know, I'm doing pretty
well as an artist myself.

19:20.264 --> 19:22.163
I've been selling
a lot of my stuff.

19:22.164 --> 19:24.266
Really?
We hadn't heard.

19:24.267 --> 19:26.167
And there's your cupcake.

19:26.168 --> 19:28.570
In case you didn't notice,
that container's to go.

19:28.571 --> 19:30.305
Got it.

19:31.674 --> 19:33.675
He's gone.
I got rid of him.

19:33.676 --> 19:35.944
Max?

19:35.945 --> 19:37.411
What are you doing?

19:37.412 --> 19:40.448
Punching cheesecakes.

19:40.449 --> 19:42.850
It's my version
of going to bed for two days.

19:42.851 --> 19:44.084
Are you more upset
about the marriage thing

19:44.085 --> 19:46.254
or the uniform thing?

19:46.255 --> 19:48.522
Oh, this isn't about Johnny.
I'm mad at the cheesecakes.

19:48.523 --> 19:49.957
They were supposed
to have cherries on top,

19:49.958 --> 19:53.026
and I wanted cherries!

19:53.027 --> 19:57.029
Why not me?

19:57.030 --> 20:00.267
Okay, maybe it's half
no cherries, half Johnny.

20:00.268 --> 20:02.402
Nothing ever
does work out for us.

20:02.403 --> 20:04.404
And then I hear myself saying
all that ridiculous stuff

20:04.405 --> 20:06.673
about us talking
to Martha Stewart at the gala.

20:06.674 --> 20:08.308
I mean, what was that?
It's insane.

20:08.309 --> 20:10.476
Is it?

20:10.477 --> 20:12.611
Wait, seriously, is it?

20:12.612 --> 20:15.113
Or is it just insane enough
to be genius?

20:15.114 --> 20:17.783
Max, we have the invitation.
She'll be there.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.318
Why are we wasting our time
with Paul Platt

20:19.319 --> 20:20.753
when we can
meet the real thing?

20:20.754 --> 20:22.488
We can take Martha
our best cupcake,

20:22.489 --> 20:23.955
explain our situation,

20:23.956 --> 20:25.956
and maybe...
Maybe she'll talk to us.

20:25.957 --> 20:27.792
I mean, she was a girl
with a dream once, too,

20:27.793 --> 20:31.462
and she certainly
understands hard times.

20:31.463 --> 20:34.399
You are talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.235
I am talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart!

20:38.236 --> 20:41.305
I even have my gorgeous Judith
leiber jeweled cupcake purse

20:41.306 --> 20:43.239
to smuggle the cupcake in.
It's perfect.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.709
I knew there was a reason
I took that from the townhouse.

20:45.710 --> 20:49.078
Great, you have a cupcake
and a cupcake purse.

20:49.079 --> 20:51.348
What else are we gonna
wear to the ball, cinderella?

20:51.349 --> 20:54.518
Are the rats in the alley gonna
whip us up some ball gowns?

20:54.519 --> 20:56.986
I mean, it's not exactly
like we have a fairy godmother.

20:56.987 --> 20:59.422
Hey, look, girls!

20:59.423 --> 21:05.428
I got myself a crown
and a wand at rhinestoned.

21:05.429 --> 21:09.064
I'll have the soup
in my booth.

21:12.202 --> 21:15.204
Well, this is as close
to a fairytale

21:15.205 --> 21:17.772
as you and I are ever gonna get,
so what the hell?

21:17.773 --> 21:19.274
Max, does that mean
we're gonna find

21:19.275 --> 21:20.575
a way to go to the ball?

21:20.576 --> 21:23.378
Oh, yeah.
Get your cupcake on,

21:23.379 --> 21:27.182
'cause we're gonna
get balled.

21:31.619 --> 21:33.620
Sophie, this is
so generous of you

21:33.621 --> 21:35.521
to offer to buy us dresses
for the gala,

21:35.522 --> 21:37.457
but as much as my shoes
love being back

21:37.458 --> 21:39.593
- in their place of birth...
- Oh, your shoes were born here?

21:39.594 --> 21:43.395
Mine were born in China,
but I adopted them at payless.

21:43.396 --> 21:45.030
Maybe we should
find something cheaper,

21:45.031 --> 21:46.732
at one of
those consignment stores.

21:46.733 --> 21:49.401
"Consignment stores"?

21:49.402 --> 21:51.637
Come on,
what are we, gypsies?

21:51.638 --> 21:55.440
This is big fancy ball.
We need ball gowns.

21:55.441 --> 21:57.442
Never really been
a fan of balls.

21:57.443 --> 21:59.043
In fact, always thought
they got in the way,

21:59.044 --> 22:00.812
but here we are.

22:00.813 --> 22:02.614
Well, we do have
to look amazing

22:02.615 --> 22:04.649
if we're approaching
Martha Stewart with a cupcake,

22:04.650 --> 22:06.417
so we'll find
a way to pay you back

22:06.418 --> 22:08.920
and start by doing some
cleaning jobs for you for free.

22:08.921 --> 22:12.924
No! Every year
I give money to charity,

22:12.925 --> 22:14.391
and I like
you two girls

22:14.392 --> 22:17.828
way more than the babies
with the broken smiles.

22:17.829 --> 22:21.164
So don't worry.
I got plenty of cash.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.734
Aww, a roll of hundreds.

22:23.735 --> 22:26.970
Reminds me of my Christmas
stocking stuffers.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.906
Yeah, this is fun day.

22:29.907 --> 22:33.609
I'm like Richard Gere
and you're my two hookers.

22:33.610 --> 22:35.144
Well, when you put it
like that,

22:35.145 --> 22:37.780
I'm a little
more comfortable.

22:37.781 --> 22:40.049
Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

22:40.050 --> 22:42.985
Hi, how are you?
We don't have a lot of time.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.586
We have to be
at work by 6:00.

22:44.587 --> 22:46.821
Can you show us your best
formal spring couture?

22:46.822 --> 22:50.091
Perhaps you ladies
might be more comfortable

22:50.092 --> 22:51.592
down in ready-to-wear.

22:51.593 --> 22:53.695
As I said,
we're in a bit of a rush.

22:53.696 --> 22:55.764
We might move a little quicker
if you dropped the attitude

22:55.765 --> 22:58.199
and picked up
some dresses.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.402
Show her your wad.

23:01.403 --> 23:03.671
Let's look
at some dresses.

23:03.672 --> 23:05.773
Yeah, and get us
some champagne,

23:05.774 --> 23:08.075

24:56.010 --> 24:58.612
Well, I wasn't expecting
a photo opportunity.

24:58.613 --> 25:00.814
And I left my tom cruise
man-heels at home.

25:00.815 --> 25:02.416
Max, give him a break.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.618
This is a man who was
too short to be a jockey.

25:04.619 --> 25:05.753
Oleg, give me your camera.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.220
I must approve picture.

25:07.221 --> 25:08.989
We've taken it
three times already.

25:08.990 --> 25:11.924
Han, if you want
a nip slip, just ask.

25:11.925 --> 25:14.527
My dress is too pretty
for this conversation,

25:14.528 --> 25:16.962
so I'm gonna go get the cupcake
from the refrigerator.

25:16.963 --> 25:20.300
And I'm going to warm up
my new town car for the ladies.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.702
New?
[Laughs]

25:22.703 --> 25:25.971
What is this, 2002?

25:25.972 --> 25:27.506
I hope so,

25:27.507 --> 25:29.908
then I will have chance
to meet you for first time

25:29.909 --> 25:32.010
all over again.

25:32.011 --> 25:35.914
Now this is not
professional driver talk.

25:35.915 --> 25:38.917
Hey, fancy ball Buster,
what's your deal?

25:38.918 --> 25:40.352
You told him to get
a dream and a drive,

25:40.353 --> 25:41.520
and he did.

25:41.521 --> 25:43.921
Max, I have two sore spots.

25:43.922 --> 25:45.989
Trusting men and...

25:45.990 --> 25:47.325
And here, where that
crazy Jamaican

25:47.326 --> 25:49.760
wove my extensions
too tight.

25:49.761 --> 25:51.796
I'm thinking I should wait
to put the cupcake

25:51.797 --> 25:53.831
in the cupcake purse
till we get out of the car.

25:53.832 --> 25:55.599
We want our beer batter
maple bacon cupcake

25:55.600 --> 25:57.368
to represent
our cupcake business.

25:57.369 --> 25:58.869
We have a new record.

25:58.870 --> 26:03.172
She cupcake four times
in one speech.

26:03.173 --> 26:04.941
We should go.
Upper East Side from Brooklyn

26:04.942 --> 26:06.809
at this time of day
is crazy.

26:06.810 --> 26:08.644
But we came in here
to show Earl.

26:08.645 --> 26:09.845
Maybe Earl decided
not to come

26:09.846 --> 26:11.347
since he had the night off.

26:11.348 --> 26:13.449
Max, we really should
be there at the start.

26:13.450 --> 26:16.084
That's prime Martha Stewart
stalking time.

26:16.085 --> 26:17.453
You're right.
And Martha will probably

26:17.454 --> 26:18.821
have to leave early
to get up to bake;

26:18.822 --> 26:20.823
A little something
I knows about.

26:20.824 --> 26:22.757
The only difference
between Martha and I

26:22.758 --> 26:24.191
is she probably doesn't
have to worry about

26:24.192 --> 26:25.660
waking up her roommate
who lives

26:25.661 --> 26:26.961
four feet from the oven.

26:26.962 --> 26:29.864
But otherwise, twinsies!

26:32.234 --> 26:35.837
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

26:35.838 --> 26:37.772
Earl, slow down,
your heart.

26:37.773 --> 26:38.872
Sorry I'm late, ladies.

26:38.873 --> 26:40.640
But if I run any faster,
the cops

26:40.641 --> 26:43.510
tend to pull guns on me.

26:43.511 --> 26:44.978
Got held up
at the florist shop,

26:44.979 --> 26:47.146
but I made it.
Here you go, ladies.

26:47.147 --> 26:50.083
Aww, Earl,
you got us flowers?

26:50.084 --> 26:51.451
Wrist corsages.

26:51.452 --> 26:52.786
I hope they're still
in style.

26:52.787 --> 26:54.387
They're a classic, Earl.

26:54.388 --> 26:55.888
Like you.

26:58.157 --> 27:01.927
Mmm, that was
worth the run.

27:01.928 --> 27:03.061
Let's go, ladies.

27:03.062 --> 27:06.031
Oleg is waiting
to drive you.

27:06.032 --> 27:08.934
And you drive me crazy.

27:08.935 --> 27:11.235
Yeah, yeah.
Tell it to the marines.

27:11.236 --> 27:12.937
Here, Earl,
take my phone.

27:12.938 --> 27:15.740
I can't fit it
in the purse with my cupcake.

27:15.741 --> 27:17.942
Have the best time
in the world.

27:17.943 --> 27:20.378
And say hello
to "huge" Jackman for me.

27:20.379 --> 27:23.347
[Laughs]

27:23.348 --> 27:25.450
[Engine rattling]

27:25.451 --> 27:28.084
[Engine dying]

27:29.921 --> 27:32.022
That is not a good sign.

27:32.023 --> 27:34.591
That car is smoking harder
than Bob Marley

27:34.592 --> 27:37.260
on a rasta holiday.

27:41.227 --> 27:44.004
Sophie, if my cousin Yuri
said he would be here

27:44.005 --> 27:45.939
in half hour
with parts to fix,

27:45.940 --> 27:47.907
he will be here
in half hour.

27:47.908 --> 27:49.075
Actually, it's been
40 minutes.

27:49.076 --> 27:50.977
Your cousin is like you.

27:50.978 --> 27:54.347
- He takes too long to come.
- Oh, this is news.

27:54.348 --> 27:57.183
Suddenly a woman
wants a man to finish fast.

27:57.184 --> 27:58.651
Oh, please.

27:58.652 --> 28:00.819
Sex is not
a carnival cruise.

28:00.820 --> 28:02.021
I'm a busy woman.

28:02.022 --> 28:04.256
You get on,
you get off.

28:04.257 --> 28:06.125
Can I get a hit off that?

28:06.126 --> 28:08.193
We'll just have to wait,
I guess.

28:08.194 --> 28:10.696
I mean, if I still lived
in Manhattan, I'd hail a cab.

28:10.697 --> 28:13.165
But that's not gonna happen
out here in the boondocks!

28:13.166 --> 28:14.999
Plus, even if we could
afford a cab,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.368
we'd be stuck forever
in rush hour gridlock.

28:17.369 --> 28:18.703
Could you take it down
a notch?

28:18.704 --> 28:20.004
Hipsters are starting
to look at us

28:20.005 --> 28:21.939
like we're trying too hard.

28:21.940 --> 28:23.474
Where did han go?

28:23.475 --> 28:25.043
He said he might
have a plan.

28:25.044 --> 28:28.112
Oh, my lord and Taylor!

28:39.557 --> 28:42.625
That little mother
can ride.

28:49.066 --> 28:52.702
You two look like
two princesses in a fairy tale.

28:52.703 --> 28:54.203
Are you feeling safe?

28:54.204 --> 28:55.637
I couldn't feel any safer

28:55.638 --> 28:58.074
if we were riding
a rubber into town.

28:58.075 --> 28:59.641
Here we go.
Bye, guys.

28:59.642 --> 29:02.711
- Bye.
- Go, Chestnut!

29:12.421 --> 29:14.923
Oh, check it out.
You see what I see?

29:14.924 --> 29:16.591
Hello, officers.

29:16.592 --> 29:18.158
We're on way to the ball
down the street,

29:18.159 --> 29:19.459
and we were wondering
if we could please leave

29:19.460 --> 29:21.128
our horse with your horses?

29:21.129 --> 29:22.462
And I can save you
the time

29:22.463 --> 29:23.764
on the breathalyzer test;

29:23.765 --> 29:25.465
No, we are not drunk

29:25.466 --> 29:27.567
or on some bachelorette
party scavenger hunt.

29:27.568 --> 29:28.969
Our car broke down
in Brooklyn,

29:28.970 --> 29:30.738
so we rode over
the Brooklyn bridge and up.

29:30.739 --> 29:33.440
You rode a horse
across the Brooklyn bridge?

29:33.441 --> 29:35.407
That's badass.

29:35.408 --> 29:37.676
Yes...
And illegal.

29:37.677 --> 29:40.012
In that case,
we took the tunnel.

29:40.013 --> 29:42.581
Well, I think we can help
you two ladies.

29:42.582 --> 29:44.751
Not gonna happen, Dave.
We're on duty.

29:44.752 --> 29:46.719
Officers, we're already
a little late.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.420
And with all due respect,
we don't have time

29:48.421 --> 29:50.021
to play good cop,
bad cop.

29:50.022 --> 29:53.424
Or in your cases,
hot cop, hot cop.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.228
Well, I think we can help
you ladies.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.763
Let's get you down
off of there.

29:57.764 --> 30:00.331
I got the one
in the low-cut.

30:00.332 --> 30:04.369
Thanks officer hot
and officer hotter.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.170
You know I'm officer hotter,
right?

30:06.171 --> 30:07.537
Oh, come on, man.
Have you seen me

30:07.538 --> 30:10.440
in my sunglasses?
No contest.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.914
Max, I'm really impressed
with how well

30:16.915 --> 30:18.715
you're maneuvering around
in that long skirt.

30:18.716 --> 30:21.851
Yeah, I was a serving wench
at a medieval times restaurant.

30:21.852 --> 30:23.386
It's a breeze
when I'm not carrying

30:23.387 --> 30:26.689
a tray loaded
with Turkey legs and ale.

30:26.690 --> 30:28.524
There's the "will call"
table.

30:28.525 --> 30:30.393
Walk in front
and I'll hide behind you,

30:30.394 --> 30:32.929
as I'm the most hated woman
in New York.

30:32.930 --> 30:34.630
So basically,
I'm a human shield?

30:34.631 --> 30:37.700
Well, you have more up here
to stop anything.

30:39.235 --> 30:40.368
- Max!
- What?

30:40.369 --> 30:41.569
Did someone pull a gun?

30:41.570 --> 30:43.305
I knew that
was gonna happen.

30:43.306 --> 30:45.073
No, I screamed because
I saw the couple

30:45.074 --> 30:48.343
whose sworn statement
put my father in prison.

30:48.344 --> 30:49.644
Max!

30:49.645 --> 30:51.013
Acid in your pretty face?

30:51.014 --> 30:52.714
Sorry, I stayed up
all night reading

30:52.715 --> 30:54.982
what people want to do
to you in your hate mail.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.818
What was it?

30:56.819 --> 30:59.720
I went down so fast,
I may have smeared my cupcake.

30:59.721 --> 31:02.790
That's the filthiest sounding
clean thing I ever heard.

31:02.791 --> 31:04.725
It's fine. Good.

31:04.726 --> 31:06.760
Now let's go get those cheap
plastic security bracelets

31:06.761 --> 31:10.430
that ruin
our expensive gowns.

31:10.431 --> 31:12.332
- Can I get your name?
- Caroline...

31:12.333 --> 31:13.599
[Whispers]
Channing.

31:13.600 --> 31:14.901
I'm sorry, what?

31:14.902 --> 31:15.902
Caroline...

31:15.903 --> 31:17.503
[Quietly]
Channing.

31:17.504 --> 31:19.206
What's with you?
Just say your name.

31:19.207 --> 31:20.573
Channing.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.509
Did you say channing?
Caroline channing?

31:23.510 --> 31:26.678
Wait, are you
<i>that</i> Caroline channing?

31:26.679 --> 31:29.448
Shh, yes, and I personally
called the R.S.V.P. number.

31:29.449 --> 31:30.749
It has to be there.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.319
Channing,
channing, channing...

31:33.320 --> 31:35.520
No, I don't see
"Caroline channing."

31:35.521 --> 31:37.622
Shh.
Maybe it's under my name.

31:37.623 --> 31:39.424
Max black.
I'm with her.

31:39.425 --> 31:42.961
Black... no, no, no,
I don't see any blacks here.

31:42.962 --> 31:45.964
You mean besides
the ones working security?

31:45.965 --> 31:49.267
Let me check with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

31:49.268 --> 31:50.735
He's on the phone
with him right now.

31:50.736 --> 31:54.272
Hey, Brody.
Both: Oh, no.

31:54.273 --> 31:56.875
There's a problem
with the list.

31:56.876 --> 31:58.942
She's not on it.
Her.

31:58.943 --> 32:01.111
- Caroline channing.
- Sh

32:01.112 --> 32:02.445
Paul, I've got
Caroline channing,

32:02.446 --> 32:03.981
and she's not on the list.

32:03.982 --> 32:07.217
If everybody in this line
could just wait until

32:07.218 --> 32:10.921
we get the Caroline channing
situation under control...

32:10.922 --> 32:13.490
If you say "channing"
one more time,

32:13.491 --> 32:15.758
I'm going to actually
pull your voice box out.

32:15.759 --> 32:18.227
And its s so much
more violent than it sounds.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.695
Yes, Paul,
I'll tell them.

32:19.696 --> 32:21.063
There's been
a little mix-up.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.498
Five more minutes
will get you right in.

32:22.499 --> 32:26.068
[Whispering]
You're not getting in.

32:26.069 --> 32:29.138
Well, that's it.
We tried.

32:29.139 --> 32:30.838
- We gave it our best shot.
- Oh, no.

32:30.839 --> 32:32.740
This is the closest
I have ever gotten

32:32.741 --> 32:35.143
to anything in my life
almost working out.

32:35.144 --> 32:37.678
- We are not giving up.
- How are we getting in?

32:37.679 --> 32:40.315
- Security's everywhere.
- Yeah, out here,

32:40.316 --> 32:41.783
but not
at the servers' entrance.

32:41.784 --> 32:43.418
I catered this
last year.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.153
That's right,
we're going backdoor.

32:47.155 --> 32:48.588
Ooh!

32:49.424 --> 32:51.926
That lady
just punched me.

32:51.927 --> 32:55.095
I knew
that was gonna happen!

33:02.336 --> 33:04.971
So you can
just walk in here?

33:04.972 --> 33:06.940
Anyone can
just walk right in?

33:06.941 --> 33:08.607
Well, it helps
that last year

33:08.608 --> 33:10.176
I made out with
the tent flap guard, Rico,

33:10.177 --> 33:12.145
but basically,
yeah, anyone.

33:12.146 --> 33:13.679
When I think
of all the times

33:13.680 --> 33:15.614
I left my purse
on a table here unattended,

33:15.615 --> 33:18.383
I shudder...
Shudder.

33:18.384 --> 33:20.852
Okay, so we can't
get in the actual building

33:20.853 --> 33:22.354
without being caterers,

33:22.355 --> 33:23.655
so we have to change
into those uniforms.

33:23.656 --> 33:24.990
Wait.

33:24.991 --> 33:26.123
You never mentioned
anything about

33:26.124 --> 33:27.658
a rent-a-clothes
situation.

33:27.659 --> 33:30.361
Small price to pay
for us making it.

33:30.362 --> 33:34.966
Is it? Is it
a <i>small</i> price to pay?

33:37.235 --> 33:39.937
Hurry, we have
a superstar to stalk!

33:39.938 --> 33:42.205
I thought I would hate it,
but I'm kind of into it.

33:42.206 --> 33:43.873
I'm very Janelle Monae.

33:43.874 --> 33:46.576
No, you're Janelle
I-have-no-Monae.

33:46.577 --> 33:48.644
What are we going to do
with our dresses?

33:48.645 --> 33:50.480
We can't leave them out here.
I need them inside.

33:50.481 --> 33:52.415
I have to look amazing
when I meet Martha Stewart.

33:52.416 --> 33:54.250
What does it matter
what we're wearing?

33:54.251 --> 33:55.852
We're still going to be
the two crazy girls

33:55.853 --> 33:57.887
chasing her down
with a cupcake.

33:57.888 --> 34:00.356
- That's why it matters.
- Oh, ooh!

34:00.357 --> 34:01.756
I know.
Here.

34:01.757 --> 34:03.125
Help me get
the shelves out of this.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.360
We can hang
our dresses in here

34:04.361 --> 34:06.228
and push them in.
Brilliant.

34:06.229 --> 34:08.530
Kind of like the Louis Vuitton
travel wardrobe I used to have.

34:08.531 --> 34:12.368
Or the service elevator
I was born in.

34:14.402 --> 34:15.902
Coming through, hot food.

34:15.904 --> 34:17.771
Look out, very hot!
Man, it's hot.

34:17.772 --> 34:19.040
You're a waiter,
not a weatherman.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.674
Hey, pretty girls,

34:20.675 --> 34:23.011
I like the way you push around
that big steel box

34:23.012 --> 34:26.280
why don't you come over here
and I'll have sex with you?

34:26.281 --> 34:29.449
A display like that
really makes you appreciate

34:29.451 --> 34:31.318
oleg's nuanced wit.

34:33.687 --> 34:36.056
Okay, let's go right
to the ladies room

34:36.056 --> 34:37.290
so we can change.

34:37.291 --> 34:40.060
Is it that way
or that way?

34:40.061 --> 34:41.194
What?

34:41.195 --> 34:42.594
Shh, Johnny!

34:42.596 --> 34:44.764
How'd he get invited?

34:44.764 --> 34:46.831
This used to be
an exclusive event.

34:46.833 --> 34:48.100
He's "made it,"

34:48.101 --> 34:49.801
he goes where
"made it" people go.

34:49.802 --> 34:51.770
Why are we hiding
from that lowlife?

34:51.771 --> 34:54.440
If he sees me
in another waiter uniform,

34:54.440 --> 34:56.442
I'm the sad girl
always in the uniform.

34:56.443 --> 34:58.210
If he sees me
in that dress at the ball,

34:58.211 --> 34:59.245
he can suck it.

34:59.246 --> 35:03.148
Ladies room, that way.

35:06.985 --> 35:09.354
The ladies room
is right down here.

35:09.355 --> 35:12.823
Push harder. Harder!

35:12.824 --> 35:15.060
Do you want Martha
to see you dressed like that?

35:15.061 --> 35:16.561
- Move! Coming through!
- Excuse us.

35:16.562 --> 35:18.929
Food emergency.

35:18.930 --> 35:20.264
Fingers, fingers,
fingers, fingers.

35:20.265 --> 35:21.765
Coming through,
coming through.

35:21.766 --> 35:22.999
- Excuse us.
- Look alive, red!

35:23.000 --> 35:25.502
- I almost hit you.
- Hold up.

35:25.503 --> 35:27.471
Now just hold up.
What is going on right now?

35:27.472 --> 35:29.039
You can't bring
food in here.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.208
Oh, it's not food.
That would be weird.

35:31.209 --> 35:33.544
It's dresses.
We have to change into these,

35:33.545 --> 35:35.010
'cause she has this guy
she wants to impress,

35:35.011 --> 35:36.412
and I have to change
into it

35:36.413 --> 35:38.247
because I'm stalking
Martha Stewart.

35:38.248 --> 35:40.983
Ooh, I'd be
a terrible spy.

35:40.984 --> 35:42.351
Usually I don't get
the long stories

35:42.352 --> 35:43.652
till the end of the night,

35:43.653 --> 35:45.121
and by then,
the girls are crying

35:45.122 --> 35:47.723
and begging me
for Wisdom and tic tacs.

35:47.724 --> 35:49.092
I'll go first.

35:49.093 --> 35:50.625
I have to get two of these
in one dress.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.561
Miss, do you have
a shoehorn?

35:59.005 --> 36:02.207
Come on,
chanel shoes!

36:02.208 --> 36:05.510
Come on,
chanel knockoffs.

36:05.511 --> 36:06.712
Why are you
not dressed yet?

36:06.713 --> 36:08.947
'Cause ladies take forever.

36:08.948 --> 36:10.982
It's all the spanx.

36:10.983 --> 36:13.719
Well, go, use my stall.
I want to go stick my head out,

36:13.720 --> 36:17.187
and see if I
can scope out Johnny.

36:17.188 --> 36:19.323
No, ma'am, no!
Not fair, ma'am.

36:19.324 --> 36:21.291
Try the handicapper.
This side.

36:21.292 --> 36:23.561
Good idea.

36:23.562 --> 36:27.598
I cannot
get a break tonight.

36:29.801 --> 36:33.236
- Psst, yo, Max.
- Johnny!

36:33.237 --> 36:35.171
Who are you looking for?

36:35.172 --> 36:37.206
The Dominos guy.

36:37.207 --> 36:38.808
I was hiding in there,
'cause five more minutes,

36:38.809 --> 36:40.410
the pizza's free.

36:40.411 --> 36:42.545
I was hoping
I'd run into you.

36:42.546 --> 36:43.913
Eh, no big deal.

36:43.914 --> 36:45.982
Pretty big deal.
You look amazing.

36:45.983 --> 36:50.051
Amazing. I will go
as far as amaze-balls.

36:50.052 --> 36:51.687
Thanks.

36:51.688 --> 36:53.088
You look like a guy
in a commercial

36:53.089 --> 36:55.824
who has a ring and puppy
hidden somewhere.

36:55.825 --> 36:57.493
Can you believe it?

36:57.494 --> 36:59.294
We're both
at this shmancy thing.

36:59.295 --> 37:00.763
Look how far we've gotten.

37:00.764 --> 37:03.231
Actually,
when you think about it,

37:03.232 --> 37:07.502
we didn't get
very far at all.

37:07.503 --> 37:09.437
Nope, you're right.
We didn't.

37:09.438 --> 37:13.541
Yeah, why?

37:13.542 --> 37:15.710
Timing, I guess.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.746
Timing?

37:18.747 --> 37:20.180
Okay, whatever.

37:20.181 --> 37:23.483
You know, from now on,
when I think of you,

37:23.484 --> 37:26.753
I'm gonna think of you in this
and not the uniform.

37:28.222 --> 37:29.923
You know,
from now on,

37:29.924 --> 37:33.860
maybe you shouldn't
think of me at all.

37:33.861 --> 37:35.495
Gotta go,
Mr. Manhattan.

37:38.899 --> 37:41.867
That was awesome!
Caroline, where are you?

37:41.868 --> 37:43.268
I'm almost dressed.

37:43.269 --> 37:45.971
I just had the perfect
in-your-face good-bye

37:45.972 --> 37:47.205
with Johnny.

37:47.206 --> 37:49.675
And speaking of
"in your face,"

37:49.676 --> 37:51.944
he couldn't take his eyes
off my boobs...

37:51.945 --> 37:53.878
Boobs that
he can never have,

37:53.879 --> 37:57.214
now that
he's getting married.

37:57.215 --> 37:59.717
[Sighs]

37:59.718 --> 38:01.886
Damn, girl, you look good.
What you doing later?

38:01.887 --> 38:07.425
Can I get your number?

38:07.426 --> 38:11.061
Oh, no, the cupcake got
a little smushed in my purse.

38:11.062 --> 38:13.730
We can't show this
to Martha Stewart now.

38:13.731 --> 38:15.298
Sure, we can.

38:15.299 --> 38:16.500
You think she never
had a cupcake smush on her?

38:16.501 --> 38:18.134
[Scoffs]
I doubt that very much.

38:18.135 --> 38:20.003
Martha Stewart
is perfect.

38:20.004 --> 38:21.872
Her feet don't even
touch the ground.

38:21.873 --> 38:23.774
The woman probably doesn't
even go to the bathroom.

38:23.775 --> 38:26.676
[Toilet flushing]

38:26.677 --> 38:29.745
Martha Stewart's
hardly perfect.

38:29.746 --> 38:31.881
And how are you
this evening?

38:31.882 --> 38:34.083
No, you're right,
Martha Stewart isn't perfect.

38:34.084 --> 38:36.318
Oh, I never said that!

38:36.319 --> 38:40.022
In fact, I hear
she's a real ballbuster.

38:40.023 --> 38:41.356
You did not hear that.

38:41.357 --> 38:43.291
Yep, a real ballbuster,
you know?

38:43.292 --> 38:44.926
No, I do not know.

38:44.927 --> 38:50.098
Would you mind handing me
a towelette please?

38:50.099 --> 38:52.367
Oh, one's fine.
Thank you so much.

38:52.368 --> 38:54.703
But the fact that Martha
Stewart <i>is</i> so tough...

38:54.704 --> 38:56.670
Caroline, you need
to get out here right now.

38:56.671 --> 38:59.940
The fact that she
is a real ballbuster...

38:59.941 --> 39:01.775
Oh, dear God, help me.

39:01.776 --> 39:03.443
Is what I like
and respect about her.

39:03.444 --> 39:05.112
I mean,
the woman's a genius.

39:05.113 --> 39:07.615
Now it's getting
interesting.

39:07.616 --> 39:09.049
And besides, you can't
really believe gossip.

39:09.050 --> 39:10.317
Look at all
that hate mail I got

39:10.318 --> 39:12.019
with people
calling me a bitch,

39:12.020 --> 39:13.553
and I'm not a bitch.

39:13.554 --> 39:15.989
Well, that's debatable.

39:15.990 --> 39:19.258
- Martha Stewart, hi.
- Hello.

39:19.259 --> 39:21.794
I'm Caroline, and this is
my business partner, Max,

39:21.795 --> 39:23.530
and we have
a start-up cupcake business.

39:23.531 --> 39:26.399
Dude, are you serious?
You're still going for it.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.034
I know this is
highly inappropriate,

39:28.035 --> 39:29.568
but we brought
a cupcake here tonight

39:29.569 --> 39:31.069
in hopes that
you might taste it.

39:31.070 --> 39:33.304
So you want me
to taste your cupcake

39:33.305 --> 39:34.806
in the ladies room.

39:34.807 --> 39:37.075
What's inappropriate
about that?

39:37.076 --> 39:39.545
We're a start-up business.
We've got to take risks.

39:39.546 --> 39:40.913
This is Max.
She's the baker.

39:40.914 --> 39:42.280
You're the baker.

39:42.281 --> 39:44.516
[Weakly]
I'm the baker.

39:44.517 --> 39:46.150
Hm, it looks
quite appealing.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.519
Oh, my God.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.120
I know this
is a social event,

39:50.121 --> 39:52.322
so I'm so sorry
for making it about business.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.691
When you're in business
for yourself,

39:53.692 --> 39:55.492
you have
to take every situation

39:55.493 --> 39:57.327
as a business opportunity.

39:57.328 --> 40:01.264
Look, I have
five of these in here.

40:01.265 --> 40:04.267
I love your magazine.

40:04.268 --> 40:06.135
I read every single issue

40:06.136 --> 40:09.439
until they realized I didn't
even go to that doctor.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.407
Well, in spite
of the fact

40:11.408 --> 40:13.443
that you have not
yet washed your hands...

40:13.444 --> 40:15.411
I was just changing
my dress in there.

40:15.412 --> 40:17.345
- I'll taste it.
- You will?

40:17.346 --> 40:19.982
I like
your entrepreneurial drive.

40:19.983 --> 40:22.184
And I have a feeling
that it's actually

40:22.185 --> 40:24.419
the only way I'm gonna
get out of here alive.

40:24.420 --> 40:29.058
That is our beer batter maple
bacon spring break cupcake.

40:29.059 --> 40:31.694
- Hm, clever name.
- Thank you.

40:31.695 --> 40:33.360
It is a little smushed,
though. That's unfortunate.

40:33.361 --> 40:37.031
I told you.

40:39.534 --> 40:41.435
Mmm.
Quiet tasty.

40:41.436 --> 40:43.771
I like it.

40:43.772 --> 40:46.273
Do you girls have a card?

40:46.274 --> 40:50.043
Get it out, get it out,
get it out.

40:50.044 --> 40:52.879
Ah, thank you very much.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.348
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

40:55.349 --> 40:58.284
Well, you know who'd
really like that cupcake?

40:58.285 --> 41:00.386
Stoners.

41:02.223 --> 41:05.157
She said
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

41:05.158 --> 41:08.494
Both: Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

41:08.495 --> 41:12.098
Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!
