Narrator:
Tonight, the MasterChef
restaurant opens its doors

00:04.621 --> 00:06.890
to the world's toughest
food critics.

00:06.923 --> 00:09.226
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.328
We have invited some
of the toughest,

00:11.362 --> 00:13.230
most revered palates...

00:13.264 --> 00:14.731
Let's go! Let's go!
Put these back in.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.067
- I need steaks over here.
- ...in all of the land.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.236
- And...
- ( cheers and applause )

00:19.270 --> 00:22.739
- a special guest...
- Christina Tosi,
the queen of cakes.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.141
...with the ultimate challenge.

00:24.175 --> 00:26.277
I don't know
if I made the right decision

00:26.310 --> 00:28.712
investing my apron in you.

00:41.158 --> 00:42.659
- Whoo!
- Come on down. Let's go.

00:42.693 --> 00:43.827
Top 14!

00:43.860 --> 00:45.629
Mark: Top 14 cooks in America,

00:45.662 --> 00:47.664
and I feel like I deserve it
more than anybody.

00:47.698 --> 00:49.433
Nice.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.368
I might be, on the surface,
a 19-year-old

00:51.402 --> 00:53.204
who looks like
he needs babysitting,

00:53.237 --> 00:54.771
but I will tell you what.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.273
Coming from such a strong
culinary background,

00:56.307 --> 00:58.041
you know,
my parents being chefs,

00:58.074 --> 01:01.345
being mentored
by a restaurateur
like Joe Bastianich,

01:01.378 --> 01:03.847
I know what I'm doing, and
I couldn't feel more confident

01:03.880 --> 01:06.217
with what's happening.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.619
Welcome back
to the MasterChef kitchen,
everybody.

01:08.652 --> 01:09.953
Looks a little bit different
in here, right?

01:09.986 --> 01:11.788
All: Yes.

01:11.822 --> 01:16.193
Well, that is because
tonight we have guests.

01:16.227 --> 01:21.798
Our world-class restaurant
is running a full service
this evening.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.967
- Okay.
- Guys, trust me.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.471
Tonight's diners are guests
that you really want to impress.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.507
You'll be working
in two teams of seven.

01:30.541 --> 01:32.175
Julia and S.J.,

01:32.209 --> 01:35.078
because you won that
five ingredients challenge,

01:35.111 --> 01:37.214
tonight you both are
the captains.

01:37.248 --> 01:39.049
- Please come and join us.
- Whoo!

01:39.082 --> 01:40.884
Julia:
How exciting is this?

01:40.917 --> 01:44.054
I had a great experience
last time I was team captain,

01:44.087 --> 01:45.689
and now,
having another challenge,

01:45.722 --> 01:49.192
this is one more opportunity
to make my mentor proud,

01:49.226 --> 01:52.162
let him know I'm gonna
be here till the end.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.398
Okay, so first team pick
goes to S.J.

01:54.431 --> 01:57.568
So, this person, I've seen
what he can do in the kitchen.

01:57.601 --> 02:01.338
His technical skills and
abilities are out of this world.

02:01.372 --> 02:03.340
He's the youngest
in the competition.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.009
- My first pick is Mark.
- Nice.

02:06.042 --> 02:09.212
S.J.:
Team challenges, I'm honestly
a little bit scared of them.

02:09.246 --> 02:11.047
So my strategy is
to pick people

02:11.081 --> 02:12.583
who can be like
little mini captains,

02:12.616 --> 02:15.118
where everyone checks
and balances each other.

02:15.151 --> 02:17.020
That's a great key
for victory.

02:17.053 --> 02:19.456
Okay, Julia, now we go to you.

02:19.490 --> 02:21.892
This person is amazing
to work with.

02:21.925 --> 02:24.495
- My first pick is Ralph.
- Thank you, Julia.

02:26.263 --> 02:27.864
All right, S.J.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.766
- Gerron.
- All right.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.402
- Thank you, brother.
- Joe: Julia.

02:31.435 --> 02:33.437
- Farhan.
- Joe: Farhan.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.972
When I'm picking people,
I'm looking for
the full package.

02:36.006 --> 02:37.741
- Cesar.
- Joe: Cesar.

02:37.774 --> 02:39.410
I don't want somebody
who can just cook,

02:39.443 --> 02:40.944
but then can't talk
to other team members.

02:40.977 --> 02:42.579
Taylor.

02:42.613 --> 02:44.715
I want people who are gonna
work together, communicate...

02:44.748 --> 02:47.651
- Sam.
- ...and not feel like
they're know-it-alls.

02:47.684 --> 02:48.985
I don't want any drama
in the kitchen.

02:49.019 --> 02:50.987
- Chelsea.
- Joe: Chelsea.

02:51.021 --> 02:53.390
- Thank you.
- S.J., back to you.

02:53.424 --> 02:55.225
- Emily.
- Joe: Emily.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.561
- Emily, you're happy, huh?
- Little bit.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.663
- Ashley.
- Joe: Ashley.

02:59.696 --> 03:02.098
S.J., with this last decision,

03:02.132 --> 03:04.935
you will complete
Julia's team for her.

03:04.968 --> 03:07.304
I am going to go with Bowen.

03:07.338 --> 03:09.973
Joe:
Wow!

03:10.006 --> 03:13.076
Shanika, welcome
to the red team.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.278
Looking at my final team,

03:15.312 --> 03:17.514
I'm a little bit nervous
working with Shanika.

03:17.548 --> 03:20.617
She tends to think that all
of her ideas are right,

03:20.651 --> 03:22.152
and she's very strong-willed,

03:22.185 --> 03:24.020
and I really hope
that she'll know

03:24.054 --> 03:26.156
that she's gotta help everybody
else and work as a team.

03:26.189 --> 03:28.759
Right. Now that you know
your teams,

03:28.792 --> 03:31.428
you should know
there's even more on the line,

03:31.462 --> 03:33.530
because tonight's winning dish

03:33.564 --> 03:37.434
will be featured
in "Family Circle" magazine

03:37.468 --> 03:38.469
in October's issue!

03:38.502 --> 03:41.438
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

03:41.472 --> 03:46.142
"Family Circle" is
America's best-selling food
and family magazine,

03:46.176 --> 03:49.613
reaching 15 million
readers each month.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.116
- Wow.
- To be in
"Family Circle" magazine

03:53.149 --> 03:55.285
would be such a pivotal moment

03:55.318 --> 03:57.554
for all of us as home cooks.

03:57.588 --> 04:00.023
For other people
to read our recipe

04:00.056 --> 04:02.793
and recreate our food
would be a dream come true.

04:02.826 --> 04:06.630
So, your challenge will be
to make an entrée

04:06.663 --> 04:09.633
worthy of a fine dining
restaurant.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.635
And you'll be making
those entrées

04:11.668 --> 04:13.870
for some of the toughest,

04:13.904 --> 04:17.708
some of the most refined,
experienced,

04:17.741 --> 04:21.011
revered palates
in all of the land.

04:23.279 --> 04:24.648
Tonight, both teams
will have to cook

04:24.681 --> 04:29.019
using the incredible ingredients
in those crates.

04:29.052 --> 04:30.587
Red team, blue team, please,

04:30.621 --> 04:32.823
wheel your crates
to your stations.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.492
- Got it.
- Whatever is in that box,

04:35.526 --> 04:37.160
we have to execute
at the highest level possible,

04:37.193 --> 04:40.330
because not only are
we creating a fine dining dish

04:40.363 --> 04:42.566
for our guests,
but we're also cooking

04:42.599 --> 04:44.735
in order to get that recipe
in the magazine.

04:44.768 --> 04:47.003
This team challenge definitely
raises the bar just a bit.

04:47.037 --> 04:51.575
Each team will be making entrées
for a full restaurant,

04:51.608 --> 04:55.011
and you'll have just
90 minutes.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.449
Each guest will be served
one entrée from each team,

04:58.482 --> 05:00.250
and vote on which dish
they prefer.

05:00.283 --> 05:03.620
Tonight's winning team will
be safe from elimination,

05:03.654 --> 05:05.288
and the losing team,
of course,

05:05.321 --> 05:07.858
will face
the dreaded pressure test.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.026
- Everybody ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.296
Your 90 minutes...

05:13.329 --> 05:15.098
starts...

05:16.767 --> 05:17.901
...now!

05:17.934 --> 05:19.135
Let's go, let's go,
let's go. Open it up.

05:19.169 --> 05:21.738
- Oh!
- Yes!

05:21.772 --> 05:24.407
- S.J.: Strip filet, cod, tuna.
- It's on, y'all. Oh, my--

05:24.441 --> 05:26.443
- Come on, bro.
- Those mushrooms are awesome.

05:26.477 --> 05:27.944
Got some quinoa,
couscous.

05:27.978 --> 05:30.213
- Oh, my gosh, there's truffles.
- Wow. What's that?

05:30.246 --> 05:32.816
Bottarga.
Oh, look at how gorgeous.

05:32.849 --> 05:34.217
All right, let's plan,
let's plan.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.719
What do we think
about the protein?

05:35.752 --> 05:37.754
- I'm thinking the tuna.
- The tuna. Tuna looks nice.

05:37.788 --> 05:39.723
- Don't you like steak?
- I like--

05:39.756 --> 05:41.424
- Aren't you a steak girl?
- I like the filet.

05:41.458 --> 05:42.959
What are you thinking,
S.J.?

05:42.993 --> 05:44.661
So I'm definitely thinking
the New York strip.

05:44.695 --> 05:46.563
You know the fat right here,
we can render it off.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.732
Get the marbling on there, too.
Get a nice hard sear.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.602
We're gonna do filet. Who has
experience in cooking meat?

05:51.635 --> 05:54.237
- And don't lie about it.
- I could do it, if you--

05:54.270 --> 05:56.272
- We're doing medium rare,
right?
- We could do, like,

05:56.306 --> 05:58.241
a roasted asparagus,
roasted peewees,

05:58.274 --> 05:59.676
- and a New York strip
with a béarnaise.
- Yeah?

05:59.710 --> 06:00.977
I mean, I'm very safe
with egg sauces.

06:01.011 --> 06:02.245
- I love that.
- Okay, yeah, perfect.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.414
- Break!
- Ralph, Farhan, steaks.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.483
Taylor, Shanika, broccolini.

06:06.517 --> 06:08.819
Ashley and Chelsea,
you guys are gonna do purées.

06:08.852 --> 06:10.353
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah, let's go.

06:10.386 --> 06:11.955
- Ready?
- All: Red team!

06:11.988 --> 06:14.491
Come on. All of you,
speed up, guys.

06:14.525 --> 06:16.593
Shanika:
We're speeding.
Get organized.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.461
Check in with me every, like,
five minutes, okay?

06:18.495 --> 06:20.597
- We need to check
everything, okay?
- Yeah, I'm checking everything.

06:20.631 --> 06:21.865
- Emily: Everyone.
- Gordon: Wow.

06:21.898 --> 06:23.767
The MasterChef restaurant
is sold out.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.803
The people who are coming are
of the most demanding kind,

06:26.837 --> 06:29.339
and they have every
ingredient available

06:29.372 --> 06:30.607
to satiate those demands.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.108
These are thick-ass steaks.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.877
We need to figure out
a game plan for cooking them.

06:33.910 --> 06:35.378
Do we wanna start
seasoning the steaks?

06:35.411 --> 06:37.313
- I think so.
- Yeah, start seasoning.

06:37.347 --> 06:40.551
- Salt and pepper, simple.
- I'm thinking start
it off in the pan,

06:40.584 --> 06:42.152
and then close in the oven
to a medium rare.

06:42.185 --> 06:44.220
'Cause we have to get
40 portions out
at the same time.

06:44.254 --> 06:45.822
That's the tricky part
with this filet.

06:45.856 --> 06:49.325
Julia was a team captain in
the last team challenge and won,

06:49.359 --> 06:52.362
so she has that kind of
confidence and that
experience behind her.

06:52.395 --> 06:53.530
How's the broccolini?

06:53.564 --> 06:54.798
- Good.
- Coming up.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.233
- Okay.
- She has a strong personality,

06:57.267 --> 06:58.401
and I think
unlike the blue team,

06:58.434 --> 07:00.637
she wants to be
that single voice.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.005
Blue team,
much more democratic.

07:02.038 --> 07:03.807
Hey, S.J., what do you think
about getting a little bit

07:03.840 --> 07:05.141
of truffle shave
under the melted leeks?

07:05.175 --> 07:06.810
- Is it gonna go well?
- I think right on top,

07:06.843 --> 07:09.045
one slice of truffle to mimic
the mushrooms that we have.

07:09.079 --> 07:10.714
Heard that.
That's a good idea, yeah.

07:10.747 --> 07:12.215
Gordon:
S.J.'s in the middle
of the pack.

07:12.248 --> 07:13.650
- Can he lead?
- He's young.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.218
They have a lot
of talented people,

07:15.251 --> 07:17.654
a lot of opinions, maybe too
many opinions on the blue team.

07:17.688 --> 07:18.855
That's what worries me.

07:18.889 --> 07:20.691
Gordon:
Tonight is his time to shine.

07:20.724 --> 07:23.159
When they see
who's judging their food,

07:23.193 --> 07:24.828
their jaws are going to drop.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.863
All right, guys.
Work quick, guys, work quick.

07:26.897 --> 07:28.865
Red team, blue team,
listen up.

07:28.899 --> 07:32.903
Our guests are arriving now.

07:32.936 --> 07:37.107
Please welcome
very special guests...

07:39.142 --> 07:42.378
( cheers and applause )

07:42.412 --> 07:44.280
Hey!

07:44.314 --> 07:46.082
Oh, my God.
They're kids!

07:46.116 --> 07:49.352
- Hi, guys!
- Boys and girls, welcome.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.721
( gasps )

07:50.754 --> 07:52.956
What's up, guys? How you doing?
How you doing?

07:52.989 --> 07:55.091
I'm looking at these kids,
and it's good to see

07:55.125 --> 07:57.027
somebody else a little bit
closer to my age.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.930
Look at you guys.
High-five, high-five.

07:59.963 --> 08:03.366
- Hey, guys!
- Welcome, welcome.
Your table is waiting.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.301
Woman:
Hi, beautiful!

08:06.336 --> 08:07.537
Come here, bud.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.972
Come here, princess.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.776
- Are you two hungry?
- Both: Yes.

08:12.809 --> 08:14.577
- What are hoping for?
- Pizza.

08:14.611 --> 08:16.046
Pizza. Pizza?

08:16.079 --> 08:18.381
Both: Yeah.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.383
All right,
so then that means

08:20.416 --> 08:22.385
this really has
to be kid-friendly.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.420
Good to see you both.
Enjoy dinner.

08:24.454 --> 08:25.956
I can't wait to hear
your feedback.

08:25.989 --> 08:28.091
Your table for two awaits you.

08:28.124 --> 08:29.760
Don't get flustered.

08:29.793 --> 08:33.830
Shanika:
Julia, what the hell
are we gonna do now?

08:33.864 --> 08:35.632
Six-year-olds are not gonna eat
bloody steak.

08:35.666 --> 08:38.101
40 minutes to go.

08:38.134 --> 08:39.836
Farhan:
Julia, should we rethink
the steak for the kids?

08:39.870 --> 08:41.404
It's all right.
We'll work it out.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.874
This is a disaster.

08:52.348 --> 08:53.483
Julia:
I need steaks over here!

08:53.516 --> 08:55.451
Gordon:
In 20 minutes from now,

08:55.485 --> 08:57.754
we have to start plating.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.089
Speed up, guys.
Let's go.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.191
Joe:
They're hungry, these kids--

09:01.224 --> 09:04.427
between six and nine years old
with big appetites.

09:04.460 --> 09:07.630
Julia, should we rethink
how we cook the steak
for the kids?

09:07.664 --> 09:10.033
- What do you want,
medium or well done?
- Medium, medium well.

09:10.066 --> 09:12.102
- Heard.
- And listen, Chelsea,
that purée--

09:12.135 --> 09:14.337
these are kids, they don't
like to eat vegetables,

09:14.370 --> 09:16.973
so I want a little bit sweeter
so they don't think
it's a vegetable.

09:17.007 --> 09:19.009
- Okay?
- I got you, girl.

09:19.042 --> 09:20.443
- Right, Captain Julia.
- Yes.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.945
Give me an insight
into the menu.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.115
- What are you doing?
- We have a pan-seared filet

09:25.148 --> 09:28.151
with a leek and bacon
cream sauce,

09:28.184 --> 09:29.786
butternut squash purée,

09:29.820 --> 09:31.988
- and sautéed broccolini.
- Okay.

09:32.022 --> 09:34.457
- You've seen our guests.
- I do.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.126
Are we adapting?

09:36.159 --> 09:38.528
We're gonna make the purée
a little bit sweeter for them.

09:38.561 --> 09:40.063
The sauce, I'm not gonna put
too much of it.

09:40.096 --> 09:41.965
And then I'm doing some
Parmesan tuiles

09:41.998 --> 09:44.034
that we're gonna
put on top of the filet.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.902
- Be careful,
it's Parmesan cheese.
- Yes, Chef.

09:45.936 --> 09:47.904
It's not every six-year-old's
choice of cheese.

09:47.938 --> 09:49.339
- I understand.
- If it was cheddar,
I'd get it.

09:49.372 --> 09:50.741
- So just be smart.
- Okay.

09:50.774 --> 09:52.042
And you,
you need to wake up.

09:52.075 --> 09:53.977
- See this one here?
- This one, yes.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.979
Yeah, and look
at the furthest one away.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.882
One's got no color on,
one's got lots of color on.

09:58.915 --> 10:01.651
They're a different cookness.
I'll get it consistent, Chef.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.319
- All the same, yes?
- All the same, yes, Chef.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.388
- I heard.
- Let's go.

10:05.421 --> 10:07.724
- Where are the thick ones?
- These need to cook
a little longer.

10:07.758 --> 10:09.860
Julia:
Keep it going, guys.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.932
I got béarnaise done
in 15, 20 minutes.

10:15.966 --> 10:17.934
Perfect, perfect.
If you guys need anything,

10:17.968 --> 10:20.003
keep talking to me.
Just let me know.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.905
S.J. S.J.!

10:21.938 --> 10:23.406
- What's going on?
What's the dish?
- Yes, Joe.

10:23.439 --> 10:24.841
So, we'll be--
( stammers )

10:24.875 --> 10:26.843
We are doing a pan-seared
New York strip

10:26.877 --> 10:29.746
- Okay.
- with a, uh--

10:29.780 --> 10:31.882
wait, Emily, what was the--
uh, the fennel?

10:31.915 --> 10:33.383
- Or the leeks?
Oh, yeah, leeks.
- Emily: Leeks.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.185
You don't know
what your dish is.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.853
- You're the captain.
You have to know.
- Oh, no-- yeah, sorry.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.454
- Mark. What's the dish?
- Yes, sir.

10:38.488 --> 10:39.722
Maybe Mark knows
what the dish is.

10:39.756 --> 10:41.057
We're doing a seared
New York strip

10:41.091 --> 10:42.425
with a béarnaise sauce,
roasted mushroom,

10:42.458 --> 10:43.693
smashed and fried potatoes

10:43.726 --> 10:45.261
with a few things
of asparagus,

10:45.295 --> 10:47.097
frizzled leeks,
and a shave of truffle.

10:47.130 --> 10:49.032
Okay, S.J.,
that's how you do it.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.867
- You gotta call it out.
- Got you.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.103
Have you adapted your dish
for the young palates?

10:53.136 --> 10:55.205
They're gonna be voting.
They're gonna decide
between the two dishes.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.273
You know,
we're gonna generally follow

10:57.307 --> 10:58.708
along the same route
that we've been following.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.143
We do have other elements

11:00.176 --> 11:01.544
that we think, you know,
kids would really like,

11:01.577 --> 11:04.915
like the fried potatoes
with the fried leeks as well.

11:04.948 --> 11:07.650
Just be mindful
of a kid's palate.

11:07.683 --> 11:10.153
How about the seasoning,
the truffles?

11:10.186 --> 11:12.255
- Eighty-six
the truffles. Yes.
- Okay.

11:12.288 --> 11:14.257
Mark. You think it's
a good idea to cook

11:14.290 --> 11:16.726
your béarnaise like that?
That aggressively over that?

11:16.759 --> 11:19.062
- Absolutely. I've made it
better over this way.
- How about a double boiler?

11:19.095 --> 11:20.430
It's faster.
A double boiler takes too long.

11:20.463 --> 11:22.398
You have plenty of time.
Do you wanna make it right

11:22.432 --> 11:24.234
- or do you wanna make it wrong?
- I gotta make it right
this way.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.735
This is the way
my father taught me

11:25.768 --> 11:28.238
and I'll continue
to do it forever.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.740
- But, Mark, seriously,
you come from a restaurant.
- Yes, sir.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.642
- You know you do things
the right way.
- Right.

11:32.675 --> 11:34.744
This shouldn't be a time for you
to take risks or shortcuts.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.746
Any brunch service
I've been a part of,

11:36.779 --> 11:38.781
with all due respect
to the true technique,
this is how I've done it.

11:38.815 --> 11:40.316
There's a right
and a wrong way to do it.

11:40.350 --> 11:42.585
- Absolutely.
- And you're telling me at 19,

11:42.618 --> 11:45.822
- you're gonna
reinvent béarnaise?
- I'm not saying anybody's wrong

11:45.856 --> 11:47.157
or one right technique
is better than the other,

11:47.190 --> 11:51.461
- just that this is my own.
- All right.

11:51.494 --> 11:54.097
All right, guys.
The béarnaise,

11:54.130 --> 11:56.332
I really don't think is
a good idea to serve anymore.

11:56.366 --> 11:57.834
Mark:
What kind of sauce
do you need?

11:57.868 --> 11:59.502
Emily:
There's no time
to reconstruct it.

11:59.535 --> 12:01.771
Just make it creamy,
make it delicious, less acidic.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.139
Okay, fine, we're sticking
with the béarnaise.

12:03.173 --> 12:04.875
We're gonna make it
a little more creamy, though.

12:04.908 --> 12:06.809
- Mark, can you handle-- okay.
- Yes.

12:06.843 --> 12:08.044
I believe in you,
I believe in you.

12:08.078 --> 12:10.180
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

12:11.414 --> 12:12.782
Aarón:
Get this, Gordon.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.284
Mark's cooking the béarnaise

12:14.317 --> 12:16.987
with the bowl in
direct contact to the flame.

12:17.020 --> 12:19.289
Gordon:
Raw egg yolks?
Don't do that to us,

12:19.322 --> 12:20.957
especially
for tonight's clients.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.659
- Oh, my gosh.
- We need 40, so...

12:23.693 --> 12:25.128
Julia: Ralph,
are you almost done?

12:25.161 --> 12:26.629
Chef, I'm worried
about these thick ones.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.364
- Are we plating, red team?
- Yes.

12:28.398 --> 12:30.533
- All right, guys.
- Julia: This is how
it's gonna look, guys.

12:30.566 --> 12:33.669
- A happy face?
Why the smiley face?
- Yes!

12:33.703 --> 12:34.971
Why is the sky blue?

12:35.005 --> 12:36.406
If your dish goes
into the magazine,

12:36.439 --> 12:38.308
do you want it to have
a smiley face, captain?

12:38.341 --> 12:41.411
If it's for a six-year-old, yes.
Are you a six-year-old?

12:41.444 --> 12:43.046
- But it also
has an opportunity--
- Are you a six-year-old?

12:43.079 --> 12:45.048
Have you ever been
on a winning team, Shanika?

12:45.081 --> 12:47.017
- Ooh! Ooh, okay.
- 'Cause I've been on two.
Just saying.

12:47.050 --> 12:49.219
Ashley:
This isn't, like,
a happy meal.

12:49.252 --> 12:51.321
- Listen, they're not babies.
- Yes?

12:51.354 --> 12:53.389
- Shanika: I told ya.
- That's just a little
bit amateurish.

12:53.423 --> 12:57.160
We don't need ridiculous
smiley faces three times.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.528
- Be smart, guys. Okay?
- Okay.

12:58.561 --> 12:59.996
Get 'em off,
get 'em off. Fine.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.064
I have an idea.

13:01.097 --> 13:02.765
- One circle like that.
- Beautiful.

13:02.798 --> 13:04.367
- Steak on. Done.
- Heard.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.704
- Like that?
- Yeah, perfect, perfect.

13:08.738 --> 13:11.374
- Captain of the blue team,
S.J., are we plating?
- Yes, we are, Chef.

13:11.407 --> 13:13.676
- I got béarnaise done.
- Let's go, let's go.

13:13.709 --> 13:17.513
- Blue team. Stop.
- Yes, Chef.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.250
- Come on, Mark.
Have you tasted that?
- I have tasted that.

13:20.283 --> 13:23.920
- S.J., have you seen
how runny this is?
- Yes, Chef.

13:23.954 --> 13:25.922
Making a béarnaise sauce
is difficult.

13:25.956 --> 13:27.690
The reason why we put up
a double boiler

13:27.723 --> 13:29.092
is we cook the eggs
into a sabayon,

13:29.125 --> 13:31.094
which then takes on
the clarified butter,

13:31.127 --> 13:32.895
which gives a bit of body
to the béarnaise.

13:32.929 --> 13:34.897
- Yes, yes.
- But I'm gonna stop you now.

13:34.931 --> 13:36.766
Ten years at
doing this competition,

13:36.799 --> 13:40.603
I'm not gonna be responsible for
sending undercooked egg yolks.

13:40.636 --> 13:42.105
- I apologize.
- Understood?

13:44.007 --> 13:46.109
I think we're scrapping
the sauce.

13:46.142 --> 13:49.079
- Can you help slice,
Mark, please?
- Yep.

13:49.112 --> 13:51.982
And as a captain,
you've just gone silent.

13:52.015 --> 13:54.417
How many times have I told you,
don't work with a mistake?

13:54.450 --> 13:58.254
- Yes, Chef.
- And you just shut down
like a six-year-old.

14:00.023 --> 14:02.558
We gotta work
with what we got.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.061
Gordon:
We still have
10 minutes to go.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.729
Julia:
I need a steak
over here, guys.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.164
Aarón:
Make sure you're checking
those temperatures, guys.

14:08.198 --> 14:10.000
- Yes, Chef.
- Gordon: Come on, Farhan!

14:10.033 --> 14:12.635
That's rare.
I thought you said medium.

14:12.668 --> 14:14.004
- Look.
- They're rare.

14:14.037 --> 14:16.506
It's bloody!
No kid's gonna eat that.

14:16.539 --> 14:17.773
No kids do that, no.

14:17.807 --> 14:19.309
Hey. It's not
( bleep ) Halloween.

14:19.342 --> 14:20.910
Come on.

14:20.943 --> 14:24.780
Farhan, you can't serve
rare meat to kids.

14:24.814 --> 14:26.082
They're gonna open it up,

14:26.116 --> 14:27.517
they're gonna say,
"Ew, it's gross."

14:27.550 --> 14:29.652
You have to get it well done
for these kids.

14:29.685 --> 14:33.089
- We need the votes.
- Seven and a half
minutes to go.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.824
- I need these steaks now, guys.
- Yes, heard.

14:34.857 --> 14:36.792
- Put 'em back in the oven.
- We can't leave it in the oven

14:36.826 --> 14:39.462
- and just plate these
in seven minutes.
- Farhan, come on!

14:39.495 --> 14:41.964
Julia:
We need the steaks out now.

14:48.538 --> 14:50.173
Farhan, come on!

14:50.206 --> 14:52.842
- Julia: We need
the steaks out now.
- No, they need to be--

14:52.875 --> 14:54.610
Okay, we have five minutes.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.446
Farhan:
This is like a steak knife
through my heart.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.981
I've put every steak we have
back in the oven,

14:59.015 --> 15:01.551
crank it up to 450, and
I'm gonna let 'em sit there

15:01.584 --> 15:03.286
until the last minute.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.787
That's the Hail Mary
that I'm gonna throw,

15:04.820 --> 15:08.324
and pray that these kids do not
get a raw steak tonight.

15:08.358 --> 15:10.626
These right here need
to cook longer.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.295
- I got you, I got you.
- I'm gonna get these plated,
all right?

15:12.328 --> 15:13.863
When you put down plates,
you put the M at the top

15:13.896 --> 15:15.298
and you plate every plate
the exact same,

15:15.331 --> 15:16.699
'cause these all look
out of order now.

15:16.732 --> 15:18.801
- Yeah.
- Two minutes.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.904
Let's go, guys, come on!
Each plate should be identical.

15:21.937 --> 15:23.339
We're gonna serve
three thick slices.

15:23.373 --> 15:25.475
Oh, no, that one has
so much fat on it.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.743
Emily:
If they're too rare,
do not put 'em on.

15:27.777 --> 15:29.179
- Let's pull the steaks.
- Hurry up.

15:29.212 --> 15:30.380
Guys, move out of the way.
I gotta get the steaks.

15:30.413 --> 15:32.148
- Go ahead.
- Here you go.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.417
Come on, Julia, rally round.
Finish 'em off. Come on.

15:34.450 --> 15:36.219
Get 'em on.
Get 'em on, Farhan.

15:36.252 --> 15:38.088
You don't have to look at me.
Just put 'em on high.

15:38.121 --> 15:39.089
Go, let's go, guys.
Slice and give, slice and give.

15:39.122 --> 15:40.256
Coming in, more portions.

15:40.290 --> 15:42.258
Bowen, do leeks.
Bowen, I need leeks.

15:42.292 --> 15:45.095
Gordon:
Come on, guys.
Please, finish strong.

15:45.128 --> 15:47.330
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight,

15:47.363 --> 15:49.432
- seven, six...
- Here you go.

15:49.465 --> 15:51.367
- five, four...
- Here you go. Here you go.

15:51.401 --> 15:55.371
- ...three, two, one.
- And stop.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.176
Service, please. Let's go.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.112
These kids are hungry.

16:02.145 --> 16:04.080
Plates nice and flat,
please, thank you.

16:04.114 --> 16:08.017
- Let's go.
- I feel like I could have
been more decisive

16:08.050 --> 16:09.385
when it came to
the judges' advice,

16:09.419 --> 16:11.187
especially Gordon, my mentor.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.423
You know, if we eliminated
the béarnaise earlier,

16:13.456 --> 16:15.791
we could've gotten some kind
of simple sauce out.

16:15.825 --> 16:18.094
I just really hope
that it doesn't make or break

16:18.128 --> 16:20.963
the quality
of the overall dish.

16:20.996 --> 16:22.265
- Thank you.
- Here we go, ladies.

16:22.298 --> 16:25.135
- Girl: Thank you.
- Waiter: Of course.

16:25.168 --> 16:27.470
Julia:
I really hope
that I made my mentor

16:27.503 --> 16:30.473
Chef Aarón proud of me today.

16:30.506 --> 16:33.409
We adapted our dish to
make 'em more kid-friendly.

16:33.443 --> 16:34.577
Thank you.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.412
If the steak
is cooked properly,

16:36.446 --> 16:39.115
I think we have a really good
chance at pulling this out.

16:39.149 --> 16:41.117
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:41.151 --> 16:42.452
thank you so much for coming

16:42.485 --> 16:43.919
into the MasterChef
restaurant tonight

16:43.953 --> 16:45.821
to be our very special guests.

16:45.855 --> 16:50.560
So, the red team has served
a beautiful filet mignon

16:50.593 --> 16:53.629
served over creamed leeks,
crispy Parmesan,

16:53.663 --> 16:56.766
butternut squash purée,
and broccolini.

16:56.799 --> 17:01.437
And the blue team has served
some beautiful New York strip,

17:01.471 --> 17:05.241
crispy potatoes,
wild mushrooms,
and some asparagus.

17:05.275 --> 17:09.245
It's up to you to decide
which dish you like the best.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.614
- Does everybody understand?
- All: Yes!

17:11.647 --> 17:13.082
Enjoy your two dishes.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.452
As we say in France,
bon appétit.

17:18.053 --> 17:21.291
- Girl: Eat it.
- Mmm!

17:21.324 --> 17:23.459
I think this is gonna be
a hard decision to make.

17:23.493 --> 17:25.528
- Yeah.
- I would vote
for the blue team,

17:25.561 --> 17:29.532
because the meat...
easy to cut.

17:29.565 --> 17:32.001
- True.
- Comparatively, I mean,

17:32.034 --> 17:33.703
there's pluses and minuses
for both dishes.

17:33.736 --> 17:36.005
I mean, they have like
a full filet on their plate

17:36.038 --> 17:37.507
that I think
is probably underdone.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.141
Bowen:
I feel, like,
really confident

17:39.175 --> 17:41.444
about we sliced the beef
for the children.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.214
Right. The red team
gave you the filet mignon.

17:44.247 --> 17:46.216
- How is that?
- I love the mignon,

17:46.249 --> 17:48.017
but I would not prefer
the sauce.

17:48.050 --> 17:50.486
- It's like too sweet. Yep.
- So the purée's too sweet.

17:51.887 --> 17:55.458
I think the red team's steak
was a little overcooked

17:55.491 --> 17:57.793
- a little bit.
The blue is better.
- Wow.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.996
- Like, more juicy.
- I think maybe
they should've had,

18:01.030 --> 18:02.532
like,
another little thing.

18:02.565 --> 18:04.700
- Like, maybe a little sauce?
- That's interesting.

18:04.734 --> 18:06.536
And what would you prefer?
Red or blue?

18:06.569 --> 18:08.204
- Um, blue.
- Blue. Interesting.

18:08.238 --> 18:09.805
- And?
- Blue.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.141
- Blue. So, this is
a blue table.
- Yeah.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.144
So, tell me about the red team.
What do you think?

18:15.177 --> 18:16.646
It was good.
Undercooked,

18:16.679 --> 18:18.981
but not undercooked like
the blue team's dish.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.750
- Undercooked. You can see
how red that is.
- Yeah.

18:20.783 --> 18:23.219
Oh, dear. That's so rare,
it can go back in the field.

18:23.253 --> 18:25.154
( girl chuckles )

18:25.187 --> 18:26.756
Julia:
I think that we adjusted

18:26.789 --> 18:29.592
the hell out of this menu
after we saw those kids.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.595
I feel really good
about everything that we
put on the plate.

18:32.628 --> 18:34.163
I think that we did the best
that we could.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.365
We did not fall apart.
We adapted.

18:35.398 --> 18:37.333
We win as a team,
we lose as a team.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.001
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- All right, guys. Yeah.

18:39.034 --> 18:42.338
Which one do you
like better, Gigi?

18:42.372 --> 18:43.939
I like the steak
on the blue plate.

18:43.973 --> 18:46.709
The dish looks prettier.

18:46.742 --> 18:49.078
I like the red team.

18:49.111 --> 18:51.681
The red team's? Why?

18:51.714 --> 18:53.716
( mumbling )

18:55.117 --> 18:57.553
Girl:
Wait, did you take one?

19:01.724 --> 19:04.193
So, are you ready
to meet the teams

19:04.226 --> 19:07.697
- All: Yeah!
- that cooked this wonderful
dinner for you guys?

19:07.730 --> 19:09.432
All: Yeah!

19:09.465 --> 19:10.866
Well, here they are!

19:10.900 --> 19:14.304
- The red team!
- ( cheers and applause )

19:15.070 --> 19:16.539
Hey!

19:16.572 --> 19:20.410
- And the blue team!
- ( cheers and applause )

19:21.911 --> 19:23.579
Hi, guys!

19:25.415 --> 19:27.116
Now for the moment of truth.

19:27.149 --> 19:28.784
All of you kids
have eaten both dishes

19:28.818 --> 19:31.754
and voted on the one
that you preferred.

19:32.788 --> 19:37.293
With 66% of the votes
this evening,

19:37.327 --> 19:40.129
the winning team...

19:40.162 --> 19:41.997
congratulations...

19:44.199 --> 19:46.936
- ...the red team!
- ( cheers and applause )

19:49.339 --> 19:50.773
Gordon:
Well done, the red team.

19:50.806 --> 19:53.676
Not only are you safe
from elimination,

19:53.709 --> 19:57.079
your dish will be featured
in October's issue

19:57.112 --> 19:58.414
of "Family Circle" magazine.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.983
Winning team,
head up to the balcony.

20:01.016 --> 20:04.587
- Thank you, guys!
- Joe: Losing team,
please follow us,

20:04.620 --> 20:06.922
and put on your black aprons.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.158
Gerron:
Mark had one job,

20:09.191 --> 20:11.794
to make this sauce
to perfection.

20:11.827 --> 20:15.665
It just sucks that one kid,
his know-it-all attitude,

20:15.698 --> 20:18.368
got us all sent
to the pressure test.

20:18.401 --> 20:20.670
Same thing
I tell my students,

20:20.703 --> 20:23.606
if you're not prepared to learn,
you're in for disaster.

20:23.639 --> 20:27.677
90 minutes to cook
for 40 six-year-olds.

20:27.710 --> 20:32.147
Shocking performance.
What happened?

20:32.181 --> 20:35.317
Mark,
he thinks he knows everything.
He's done learning.

20:35.351 --> 20:37.186
And, you know,
your parents have a diner,

20:37.219 --> 20:39.789
doesn't mean
you know everything.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.457
This is wrong.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.192
It was my own arrogance to not
listen to three of you--

20:43.225 --> 20:45.461
Mark, arrogance?
Are you kidding me?

20:45.495 --> 20:46.862
You remember
that we made a deal.

20:46.896 --> 20:48.731
You were gonna listen to me,

20:48.764 --> 20:51.401
and together we were gonna
take you to the finale.

20:51.434 --> 20:54.404
Well, you just decided
to take your own road.

20:54.437 --> 20:56.305
You're in "MasterChef."

20:56.338 --> 20:57.973
If you're directed
to do something properly

20:58.007 --> 21:00.376
and you choose not to do it,

21:00.410 --> 21:01.411
then I don't know
if I made the right decision

21:01.444 --> 21:03.846
investing my apron in you.

21:12.254 --> 21:14.824
Tonight you started as a team,

21:14.857 --> 21:19.429
but now you're about to face
the dreaded pressure test.

21:20.630 --> 21:23.365
This pressure test
is so daunting

21:23.399 --> 21:27.570
that we needed to invite
another judge to join us.

21:29.271 --> 21:31.674
A two-time James Beard
award-winner,

21:31.707 --> 21:34.510
author of three
best-selling cook books.

21:34.544 --> 21:37.447
All of you, turn around.

21:37.480 --> 21:42.518
Please welcome back
a member of our family,

21:42.552 --> 21:46.522
the amazing, talented...

21:46.556 --> 21:50.059
- ...Christina Tosi!
- ( cheers and applause )

21:51.393 --> 21:52.928
Yay!

21:55.431 --> 21:56.732
Oh, my God!

21:56.766 --> 21:58.468
I love baking and pastries,

21:58.501 --> 22:01.937
and I really look up
to Christina Tosi so much.

22:01.971 --> 22:03.773
You know, the culinary school
she went to is the one

22:03.806 --> 22:05.240
that I would like to go to,

22:05.274 --> 22:06.876
and I wanna go there
because I wanna be

22:06.909 --> 22:09.879
as successful
as the queen of cakes.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.313
I really hope
I can impress her.

22:11.346 --> 22:12.582
Hi, home cooks.

22:12.615 --> 22:14.049
- Hey, Christina.
- Hi, Chef.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.551
Gordon, Aarón, and Joe

22:15.585 --> 22:19.054
told me you were making kids
their dinner tonight.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.758
So, I...

22:22.792 --> 22:25.427
...brought...

22:28.297 --> 22:30.065
...dessert.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.333
- Oh!
- Wow!

22:31.366 --> 22:32.835
Cupcakes.

22:32.868 --> 22:34.403
Oh, my gosh.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.006
As you can see,
these cupcakes,

22:37.039 --> 22:39.842
they're not child's play.

22:39.875 --> 22:44.413
They're modern
culinary masterpieces.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.149
There's color,
there's personality,

22:47.182 --> 22:48.918
and slicing through a cupcake,

22:48.951 --> 22:54.289
they're light and spongy
in the center.

22:54.323 --> 22:57.793
Cupcakes, they were one of
the first things I ever made

22:57.827 --> 23:00.262
in my own kitchen
back in Virginia.

23:00.295 --> 23:03.365
And if you get it
wrong tonight,

23:03.398 --> 23:06.168
they might be
the last thing you make

23:06.201 --> 23:07.637
in the MasterChef kitchen.

23:08.738 --> 23:11.774
Tonight, we are leaving
this decision

23:11.807 --> 23:14.109
completely
in Christina Tosi's hands.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.046
You are not gonna get anything
less than perfection

23:17.079 --> 23:18.814
past Christina tonight.

23:18.848 --> 23:22.785
Home cooks,
head to your stations.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.721
In that last challenge,
I definitely had a rough time.

23:25.755 --> 23:28.490
But I have plenty
of experience baking,

23:28.524 --> 23:29.825
and I will tell you what.

23:29.859 --> 23:31.727
It's a good thing
that the only person

23:31.761 --> 23:33.529
deciding my fate
is Christina.

23:33.563 --> 23:35.631
Gordon:
You all have the exact same
ingredients

23:35.665 --> 23:37.299
to perfect your cupcakes.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.635
Aarón:
In the equipment room,
you'll find an endless

23:39.669 --> 23:40.970
amount of extra twists.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.504
You can decorate
any way you want,

23:42.538 --> 23:44.707
but whatever choices
you guys make,

23:44.740 --> 23:48.377
all of you will have
just 75 minutes

23:48.410 --> 23:51.647
to make us a box of 12
beautiful cupcakes.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.382
Christina:
All right, home cooks,

23:53.415 --> 23:57.887
your 75 minutes starts... now.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.421
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's go, y'all.

23:59.454 --> 24:01.891
- Let's go, guys.
- Whoo! Let's go, girl!

24:01.924 --> 24:05.027
Tonight I'm making
three different flavors.

24:05.060 --> 24:09.699
Green tea flavor, vanilla
flavor, and tiramisu flavor.

24:09.732 --> 24:12.201
I never had
any cupcake in China,

24:12.234 --> 24:17.940
so my strategy
is more chance to be safe
with more flavors.

24:19.408 --> 24:21.611
I'm going to be doing
a vanilla cupcake

24:21.644 --> 24:24.046
with a vanilla cream cheese
frosting,

24:24.079 --> 24:27.416
with the honey butter drizzle,
brûlée banana slices,

24:27.449 --> 24:29.018
and candied hazelnuts.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.586
Keep it up, S.J.

24:30.620 --> 24:32.454
Baking for Christina Tosi
is kinda like trying

24:32.487 --> 24:34.089
to show Roger Federer
your serve.

24:34.123 --> 24:35.758
It's a little bit daunting,
but it's a great chance

24:35.791 --> 24:37.793
to cook for a great chef.

24:37.827 --> 24:40.863
I'm gonna be making
ginger and spice cupcakes,

24:40.896 --> 24:43.766
similar to Mexican candy,
where it's spicy,

24:43.799 --> 24:46.268
tangy on the outside,
but it's sweet on the inside.

24:46.301 --> 24:49.204
I grew up with it, and while
baking's not my strong suit,

24:49.238 --> 24:50.439
I think I've practiced enough

24:50.472 --> 24:51.974
to keep me
in the competition today.

24:52.007 --> 24:55.077
All right, so,
Chef Christina, talk to us

24:55.110 --> 24:56.879
about the A to "zed"
of a perfect cupcake.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.313
What do we need
to be looking for?

24:58.347 --> 25:00.249
Christina:
Timing is key here.

25:00.282 --> 25:03.653
First things first,
you need to start making
that cupcake batter.

25:03.686 --> 25:04.887
Cream, butter, sugar.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.489
You start to add your eggs,

25:07.522 --> 25:08.991
maybe your flavoring,

25:09.024 --> 25:10.793
your dry ingredients
with your salt,

25:10.826 --> 25:12.461
your baking powder,
your baking soda--

25:12.494 --> 25:14.229
and in the right increments
is key.

25:14.263 --> 25:18.567
Christina, Aarón has four
home cooks wearing his pin,

25:18.600 --> 25:20.803
Gordon has five home cooks
wearing his pin,

25:20.836 --> 25:23.806
and I have just five
home cooks wearing my pin.

25:23.839 --> 25:27.009
Tonight, who stays and
who goes is all in your hands.

25:27.042 --> 25:29.979
Not only their fate,
our fate as well.

25:30.012 --> 25:33.615
Mentor, no mentor, for me,
it's either great or it's not.

25:33.649 --> 25:36.085
A cupcake doesn't lie.

25:36.118 --> 25:39.088
Come on, Gerron, you got this.
Nice even portions.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.956
Right, Samantha,
what are you making?

25:40.990 --> 25:44.259
So, I've done a lemon cupcake,
and then I'm gonna fill it

25:44.293 --> 25:46.195
with a lemon curd
and have the raspberry
butter cream.

25:46.228 --> 25:49.131
This cupcake is something I've
done with my sorority sisters.

25:49.164 --> 25:50.933
We actually entered it in
a cupcake contest and we won.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.135
- So-- yes, we won.
- Did-- you won.

25:53.168 --> 25:55.304
- Give that box some beauty.
Good luck.
- Yes, Chef.

25:55.337 --> 25:57.506
Thank you, Chef.

25:57.539 --> 25:59.608
Gordon:
45 minutes remaining.

25:59.641 --> 26:02.311
You've got to get that batter
in the oven.

26:02.344 --> 26:04.179
Come on. Let's go.

26:04.213 --> 26:06.615
Cupcakes in the oven.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.018
A cupcake takes about
25 minutes to bake.

26:09.051 --> 26:11.353
If you've managed
your time properly,

26:11.386 --> 26:13.789
by now you should be
focusing on the fillings,

26:13.823 --> 26:16.125
- the frosting, the decor.
- Joe: Got it.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.561
- ( humming )
- Emily, my star apron.

26:19.594 --> 26:20.896
Introduce yourself
to my friend
Christina Tosi.

26:20.930 --> 26:23.132
Hello!
I would shake your hand,

26:23.165 --> 26:25.634
- but I've got lemon juice
all over me.
- What are you making tonight?

26:25.667 --> 26:27.669
So, I'm aiming for
two different cupcakes.

26:27.703 --> 26:29.972
Chocolate, salted caramel
cream-filled cupcake

26:30.005 --> 26:31.473
with a chai
buttercream frosting.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.809
And then the second one will be
a lemon meringue cupcake.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.077
I'm from Neenah, Wisconsin.

26:35.110 --> 26:37.246
Very small town.
I'm a baker at heart.

26:37.279 --> 26:39.481
So, honestly,
when you walked
through the door,

26:39.514 --> 26:41.583
I was pretty excited
and I was hoping

26:41.616 --> 26:43.819
that you were gonna give us
a baking challenge, 'cause
I've been waiting for it.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.855
- Good luck, Emily.
- Thank you.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.090
That's what we're looking for.

26:48.123 --> 26:50.659
- All right, Gerron, I see ya.
- Go, Gerron.

26:50.692 --> 26:53.262
Right, young man,
describe your cupcakes.

26:53.295 --> 26:55.097
So, I'm from Louisville,
Kentucky, and it's
The Bourbon State,

26:55.130 --> 26:57.733
so I'm gonna do
a bourbon buttercream.

26:57.767 --> 27:00.535
But I've also decided
to do a banana walnut cupcake

27:00.569 --> 27:02.337
because it was my mom's
favorite flavor.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.107
She loved banana walnut bread,
so I just wanna
incorporate the two.

27:05.140 --> 27:07.176
- Sounds amazing. Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.878
- Keep going. Let's go.
- Thank you.

27:13.315 --> 27:16.518
20 minutes to go.
Your cupcakes should be out.

27:16.551 --> 27:17.853
Perfect.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.088
Gordon:
And chilled.

27:19.121 --> 27:20.522
- Oh, God!
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

27:20.555 --> 27:21.690
And you should start to think

27:21.723 --> 27:23.425
about those finishing touches.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.963
- Joe: Okay, Mark.
- Yes, Chef.

27:27.997 --> 27:30.766
Young Mark, wearing my apron,
is a dishwasher from Maine.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.567
He works in his parents'
family restaurant.

27:32.601 --> 27:34.937
Christina:
That's fantastic.
What's going on over here?

27:34.970 --> 27:38.941
I am making a strawberry,
lemongrass, and mint cupcake

27:38.974 --> 27:41.376
based on a very popular cocktail
at my mother's restaurant.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.712
I'm macerating some
strawberries right now
for a filling,

27:43.745 --> 27:47.149
and then it's gonna be just
a very simple mint buttercream
for the topping.

27:47.182 --> 27:49.651
- Make it happen.
- Thank you.

27:49.684 --> 27:52.554
Guys, we're down
to five minutes now.

27:52.587 --> 27:54.589
Farhan:
What's he trying to do?

27:54.623 --> 27:56.959
- He has no time
for this right now.
- He doesn't.

27:56.992 --> 27:59.161
I think that Mark is
in real trouble today.

27:59.194 --> 28:02.731
Aarón:
Mark is filling his cupcakes
with strawberries right now.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.134
- And he's making a jam--
- Strawberries are full
of water, right?

28:05.167 --> 28:08.403
It could start
to leech out water
all over your cupcake.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.906
( groans )
It's not what it needs to be.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.674
They didn't rise.

28:12.707 --> 28:14.309
Minutes from now,
it's somebody's last time

28:14.343 --> 28:16.178
- in the MasterChef kitchen.
- ( sighs ) Okay.

28:16.211 --> 28:18.814
It is so thick in here,
you can cut it with knife.

28:18.848 --> 28:21.150
Two minutes remaining.

28:21.183 --> 28:25.587
Remember, we're looking for
a box of immaculate cupcakes.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.957
Joe:
What's Emily doing?
Is she blasting the meringue?

28:27.990 --> 28:30.259
Christina:
That, for me,
is incredibly impressive.

28:30.292 --> 28:33.628
- 60 seconds. Mark! Let's go.
- What is Mark doing?

28:33.662 --> 28:35.998
Christina:
Start thinking about walking
down here, home cooks.

28:36.031 --> 28:38.000
Gordon:
30 seconds to go.

28:38.033 --> 28:39.701
Close the box.
What's Mark doing?

28:39.734 --> 28:41.670
He's just started piping.

28:41.703 --> 28:43.605
Whatever you've got,
put some in the box.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.875
- Come on, Mark.
- Mark's just starting
to put them in.

28:45.908 --> 28:47.442
- Gordon: Come on, S.J.
- Joe: Come on!

28:47.476 --> 28:50.112
- Gordon: 15 seconds to go.
- S.J., do not let this

28:50.145 --> 28:51.646
be what takes you down.
Come on, Mark.

28:51.680 --> 28:52.982
Aarón:
Ten seconds!

28:53.015 --> 28:54.783
- Oh, my God.
- Judges: Ten, nine,

28:54.816 --> 28:57.786
eight, seven, six,

28:57.819 --> 29:00.856
five, four, three,

29:00.890 --> 29:03.058
two, one.

29:10.365 --> 29:12.667
That was pretty intense.

29:12.701 --> 29:15.537
We call it a pressure test
for a reason.

29:15.570 --> 29:17.339
Now let's begin the tasting.

29:20.042 --> 29:22.844
All right, Emily,
let's take a look.

29:25.347 --> 29:28.817
Well, Emily,
you talk a good game,

29:28.850 --> 29:31.520
but I gotta tell you...

29:31.553 --> 29:33.422
they're gorgeous.

29:33.455 --> 29:37.092
- Tell me about the flavors.
- So, the chocolate cupcake
is stuffed

29:37.126 --> 29:39.394
with salted caramel,
a chai buttercream frosting,

29:39.428 --> 29:41.196
and a little bit
of gold luster dust.

29:41.230 --> 29:42.998
The other is just
a lemon cupcake

29:43.032 --> 29:44.333
with a meringue frosting.

29:44.366 --> 29:47.002
Your meringue's
incredibly impressive.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.337
How long did you whip
the egg whites for?

29:48.370 --> 29:50.205
I whipped them
over the double boiler

29:50.239 --> 29:52.041
until the sugar dissolved,
and then I just whipped them

29:52.074 --> 29:54.376
until they were cool
and held a soft peak.

29:54.409 --> 29:56.178
The flavor's balanced,

29:56.211 --> 30:00.916
and visually,
these cupcakes are perfect.

30:00.950 --> 30:02.417
But from
a technique standpoint,

30:02.451 --> 30:04.353
you gotta be careful
with that bake time,

30:04.386 --> 30:07.689
'cause I've got a lot
of that cake behind

30:07.722 --> 30:09.959
and that's not ideal.

30:09.992 --> 30:11.426
You did a really
impressive job tonight.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.528
- Thank you, Chef.
- Congratulations.

30:13.562 --> 30:16.531
- I'm gonna go
with the chocolate one.
- Yes.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.401
Salted caramel is kinda
soaked into the cake.

30:19.434 --> 30:20.735
Mmm!

30:20.769 --> 30:22.537
Well-spiced, creamy.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.239
It tastes like chai mixed in

30:24.273 --> 30:26.275
with the best molten chocolate
cake you've ever had.

30:26.308 --> 30:28.143
- Great job.
- Thank you, Chef.

30:31.746 --> 30:34.883
So, Bowen,
what did you make tonight?

30:34.916 --> 30:37.086
Bowen:
Three different kinds.

30:37.119 --> 30:41.290
Tiramisu, green tea,
vanilla flavor.

30:41.323 --> 30:43.993
- What flavor is this one?
- Green tea flavor.

30:46.996 --> 30:50.132
Bowen, visually,
you still have a ways to go,

30:50.165 --> 30:52.901
but the cupcake is well mixed,
it's well baked,

30:52.934 --> 30:54.836
and the frosting's flavorful.

30:54.869 --> 30:56.605
I'd say you did
a pretty good job.

30:56.638 --> 30:57.739
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.941
Joe:
Wow!

30:59.975 --> 31:02.477
- So, which one should I taste?
- Tiramisu.

31:04.946 --> 31:08.950
The cake itself is good.

31:08.984 --> 31:11.453
Very rich, fluffy.
You can taste the butter.

31:11.486 --> 31:12.921
Tiramisu components,

31:12.954 --> 31:14.990
I'd love to have it
a little bit smoother,

31:15.024 --> 31:17.259
but altogether, Bowen,
Gordon certainly has himself

31:17.292 --> 31:19.594
an excellent student in you.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.030
- Thank you.
- Good job.

31:22.231 --> 31:24.033
Nice.

31:24.066 --> 31:26.501
- Samantha.
- Chef.

31:26.535 --> 31:28.303
Let's take a look, okay?

31:33.808 --> 31:36.945
- Wow!
- Thank you.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.813
This is consistent.
It's vibrant in color.

31:38.847 --> 31:42.484
This is like Willy Wonka
stuff, man.

31:42.517 --> 31:44.719
So what are some of the flavors
that I'm gonna taste?

31:44.753 --> 31:47.122
Samantha: It is filled
with a lemon curd,

31:47.156 --> 31:49.324
and it's a raspberry
buttercream on top.

31:49.358 --> 31:51.360
Aarón: You said
this cupcake is inspired

31:51.393 --> 31:52.861
- by a competition you entered
- Mm-hmm.

31:52.894 --> 31:54.496
- and that you won.
- That is correct.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.068
Mmm!

31:59.101 --> 32:01.470
This is unreal.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.073
Nice and fluffy,

32:04.106 --> 32:05.907
all the specks of
that beautiful raspberry,

32:05.940 --> 32:08.310
an aerated beautiful center.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.745
Your sorority sisters must
be jumping for joy

32:10.779 --> 32:11.980
when they're seeing this.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.448
Really over the top.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.254
- Samantha.
- Chef.

32:19.288 --> 32:22.257
Your lemon curd
is bull's-eye center.

32:22.291 --> 32:23.925
( whispers )
Oh, beautiful.

32:23.958 --> 32:26.728
- Perfectionist?
- Yes, definitely.

32:26.761 --> 32:29.231
I spun the lemon zest
with the sugar

32:29.264 --> 32:30.999
to really get that flavor
even throughout,

32:31.032 --> 32:32.901
and it worked out.

32:32.934 --> 32:36.571
Um, Samantha,
it has been a very long time

32:36.605 --> 32:39.174
since I have tasted a cupcake,
that from a flavor standpoint

32:39.208 --> 32:42.244
is so incredibly
well-balanced.

32:42.277 --> 32:44.846
- Thank you, Chef. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

32:44.879 --> 32:46.181
Nice.

32:46.215 --> 32:48.917
Gerron, wearing Joe's apron.

32:48.950 --> 32:51.086
- What's up, Chef?
- Let's check in there.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.055
So I have a banana
walnut cupcake

32:54.089 --> 32:55.924
with vanilla
bourbon icing.

32:55.957 --> 32:57.792
I'm from Kentucky,
and it's the Bourbon State.

32:57.826 --> 32:59.928
Oh, dear.

32:59.961 --> 33:02.564
Looks like the old cupcakes
have had too much to drink

33:02.597 --> 33:04.633
and sunken into bed.

33:04.666 --> 33:07.035
- They don't look great,
do they?
- No, they don't.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.037
Height, it's not there.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.606
- Did you weigh out
the ingredients properly?
- I mean, honestly,

33:11.640 --> 33:14.709
when I poured in some walnuts,
I didn't really weigh those out.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.245
So you can see through there,

33:16.278 --> 33:17.546
insufficient aeration,

33:17.579 --> 33:19.581
looks like the inside
of a brownie.

33:21.516 --> 33:24.085
The bourbon's delicious,
but if we don't start off

33:24.119 --> 33:26.555
with a perfect batter,
we're screwed.

33:26.588 --> 33:29.624
I'm sorry, Gerron,
but that's been one of
your weakest performances.

33:30.659 --> 33:32.060
Damn it.

33:32.093 --> 33:35.164
All right, Gerron,
what happened?

33:35.197 --> 33:36.965
It just ended up a lot denser
than I wanted it to.

33:36.998 --> 33:39.067
See the walnuts there?

33:39.100 --> 33:40.769
It really weighed
your mixture down.

33:40.802 --> 33:43.004
Really and truly.

33:43.037 --> 33:46.641
I think they're very starchy
and underbaked.

33:46.675 --> 33:49.278
So, I'm gonna be honest.

33:49.311 --> 33:51.146
I'm not impressed.

33:54.383 --> 33:57.686
Cesar.
Let's check in there.

33:57.719 --> 34:00.989
Cesar:
The cupcake itself
is ginger, cinnamon clove,

34:01.022 --> 34:04.426
and then cream cheese cardamom
icing with spicy pistachios--

34:04.459 --> 34:07.529
something that represents
Houston, where I'm from,

34:07.562 --> 34:09.431
and the immigrant culture
that thrives there.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.933
Fresh ginger cupcake
I haven't come across.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.503
- I like the vibrant taste
of fresh ginger.
- Mmm.

34:14.536 --> 34:17.272
Here's the thing.
A little bit too much spice,

34:17.306 --> 34:18.607
but I love the fragrance.

34:18.640 --> 34:21.410
- Overall, good job.
- Thank you.

34:22.511 --> 34:24.346
Mmm.

34:24.379 --> 34:26.181
I gotta say, Cesar,

34:26.215 --> 34:28.950
it's light, it's flavorful,
and has a perspective.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.852
- Really nice effort.
- Thank you.

34:30.885 --> 34:32.153
All right, S.J.

34:32.187 --> 34:34.456
Let's see what you got
in the box.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.658
S.J.: So, you have
a standard vanilla cupcake

34:36.691 --> 34:39.294
with cream cheese frosting,
honey butter drizzle,

34:39.328 --> 34:41.463
brûléed banana,
and candied hazelnuts.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.465
Here, I'll just go
with a whole bite.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.900
Yeah, sure.

34:45.934 --> 34:48.203
Moist, good consistency.

34:48.237 --> 34:50.171
I don't think you're leaving
here tonight.

34:51.706 --> 34:53.408
Christina:
I like what you did
with the frosting.

34:53.442 --> 34:55.210
I would've loved it even more
if you were uniform.

34:55.244 --> 34:57.379
If one cupcake gets
five dots of frosting,

34:57.412 --> 34:59.681
every cupcake gets
five dots of frosting.

35:00.949 --> 35:02.351
But all in all,

35:02.384 --> 35:04.152
your cake is light
and delicious.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.455
- Great box of cupcakes.
- Thank you, Chef.

35:08.957 --> 35:11.760
Mark, in the box,
what's the theme?

35:11.793 --> 35:15.163
Uh, so it's a strawberry,
lemongrass, and mint cupcake.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.432
Let's get in there,
shall we?

35:17.466 --> 35:19.901
But, uh,
they're not all there.

35:19.934 --> 35:21.202
Excuse me?

35:22.704 --> 35:25.740
I don't have all my cupcakes
in the box.

35:25.774 --> 35:27.876
- Wow.
- That's right.

35:29.811 --> 35:31.179
( chuckles )

35:31.212 --> 35:33.548
- Yeah, I'm not laughing.
- ( chuckles )

35:41.490 --> 35:43.191
Let's get in there, shall we?

35:43.224 --> 35:45.694
But, uh,
they're not all there.

35:45.727 --> 35:46.728
Excuse me?

35:48.096 --> 35:50.932
I don't have all my cupcakes
in the box.

35:50.965 --> 35:53.268
- Wow.
- ( chuckles )

35:53.302 --> 35:55.737
- Yeah, I'm not laughing.
- ( chuckles )

36:06.080 --> 36:08.950
Uh, so it's a strawberry,
lemongrass, and mint.

36:08.983 --> 36:10.319
It's a play on a cocktail

36:10.352 --> 36:11.486
that's at my mother's
restaurant.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.888
Based on the piping,
it looks sloppy.

36:13.922 --> 36:17.592
- Right?
- Um, all in all, it's whipped
to where it needs to be.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.397
- We're missing five.
- That's right.

36:22.431 --> 36:23.898
I was very rushed.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.734
What is that in there?
That's the strawberry--

36:25.767 --> 36:27.436
Strawberry jelly
and diced strawberries.

36:27.469 --> 36:29.838
- Strawberries are 25% water.
- Yes.

36:29.871 --> 36:31.740
And so what does water do
to a sponge?

36:31.773 --> 36:33.975
Uh, it, uh--

36:34.008 --> 36:36.511
Makes it soggy.

36:36.545 --> 36:38.313
But here's
the big issue for me.

36:38.347 --> 36:42.617
Whilst we try to help you,
you reject our help.

36:42.651 --> 36:44.285
You know,
I'm not mentoring you,

36:44.319 --> 36:45.920
but you're becoming
unteachable.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.423
Of course not.

36:48.457 --> 36:51.660
You know,
having an edge above people
as young as myself,

36:51.693 --> 36:54.496
it definitely translates
into my arrogance.

36:54.529 --> 36:56.197
But, Mark, you're
not prepared to listen

36:56.230 --> 36:58.433
and grasp what people
are teaching you.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.502
That's not a recipe
for success.

37:13.848 --> 37:16.951
Strawberry, lemon, mint--
makes perfect sense.

37:16.985 --> 37:21.022
What I don't like is
the presentation, technique,

37:21.055 --> 37:23.992
and then that frosting,
you can tell it's too wet.

37:24.025 --> 37:26.461
Too much sugar there.

37:26.495 --> 37:29.498
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:31.199 --> 37:33.468
Gerron:
I messed up pretty badly,

37:33.502 --> 37:36.170
but Mark also messed up
pretty badly.

37:36.204 --> 37:38.540
Please,
come around to the front.

37:38.573 --> 37:41.242
And while his cupcakes
look a lot better than mine,

37:41.275 --> 37:43.011
I learn from my mistakes,

37:43.044 --> 37:46.014
and I will continue to grow
in this competition.

37:46.047 --> 37:47.582
All right, ready?

37:47.616 --> 37:49.684
The judges,
they know things like that,

37:49.718 --> 37:52.053
but I know that they can't
save me right now.

37:52.086 --> 37:56.391
We invited Christina here
because she truly is

37:56.425 --> 37:59.661
beyond an expert in her field.

37:59.694 --> 38:04.599
And we're leaving
this decision completely

38:04.633 --> 38:06.468
in Christina Tosi's hands.

38:10.872 --> 38:15.777
Now, I don't know you
like the judges know you.

38:15.810 --> 38:20.515
All I can do is make
my decisions

38:20.549 --> 38:23.117
based on the box of cupcakes.

38:26.287 --> 38:28.623
I am sending at least one
of you home.

38:28.657 --> 38:33.562
But I was really impressed by
a number of you tonight.

38:33.595 --> 38:37.866
So, if I say your name,
please step forward.

38:37.899 --> 38:41.069
Emily, Bowen,

38:41.102 --> 38:44.105
and I gotta say, the cupcake
that I will dream about...

38:44.138 --> 38:45.373
Wow.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.976
- ...Samantha.
- Whoo!

38:48.009 --> 38:49.377
Yes.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.779
Congratulations, you three.

38:50.812 --> 38:52.313
Up to the balcony.
You're safe.

38:52.346 --> 38:55.283
- Thank you.
- ( cheers and applause )

38:55.316 --> 38:56.585
I don't know
that this is real.

38:56.618 --> 38:58.052
It honestly just feels
like a dream.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.454
Let's go, girl!

38:59.488 --> 39:01.122
I mean,
Christina freaking Tosi

39:01.155 --> 39:03.124
told me my cupcakes were good,

39:03.157 --> 39:05.393
right in front of my mentor
Chef Gordon Ramsay.

39:05.426 --> 39:08.129
There is no going any higher
than right now.

39:09.498 --> 39:13.334
So, S.J...

39:13.367 --> 39:16.070
Cesar...

39:16.104 --> 39:19.641
you both have shown me talent,
you've shown me passion.

39:19.674 --> 39:24.145
So, you're both safe.
Please head up to the balcony.

39:32.220 --> 39:36.491
So, Mark, Gerron,

39:36.525 --> 39:40.529
you were both brought
into this kitchen

39:40.562 --> 39:42.764
by the same mentor.

39:42.797 --> 39:45.700
But I am sending one
of you home.

39:48.036 --> 39:50.138
The home cook leaving
this kitchen...

39:52.306 --> 39:54.876
is...

39:59.914 --> 40:01.650
...Mark.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.087
( exhales )

40:11.993 --> 40:16.030
Christina:
Gerron, up to
the balcony, please.

40:28.109 --> 40:30.545
Mark, unfortunately,

40:30.579 --> 40:32.714
tonight you had
the worst cupcakes

40:32.747 --> 40:35.249
in the MasterChef kitchen,

40:35.283 --> 40:36.985
so we have to say good-bye.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.653
Understood.

40:38.687 --> 40:43.692
Mark, being headstrong
can be destructive.

40:43.725 --> 40:46.527
It can also be an attribute,
used in the proper way.

40:46.561 --> 40:50.665
My advice for you would be
to open your mind up
to the right people.

40:50.699 --> 40:52.667
You're young,
the road is long.

40:52.701 --> 40:54.936
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

40:54.969 --> 40:57.672
Please, place your apron
on your bench.

40:57.706 --> 40:59.774
- Thank you.
- Good night. Thank you.

40:59.808 --> 41:02.543
- ( applause )
- Love you, Mark.

41:02.577 --> 41:05.546
Mark:
I'm definitely disappointed,
and it's very humbling.

41:05.580 --> 41:08.382
I learned from this,
I really don't know it all.

41:08.416 --> 41:10.384
- ( applause )
- Ralph: Let's go, Mark.

41:10.418 --> 41:13.387
From the beginning,
Joe told me he's making
an investment in me,

41:13.421 --> 41:16.591
and I still need to prove
that I'm worth
what he put into me.

41:16.625 --> 41:19.193
I'm 19, I'm working in
my parents' restaurants now.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.930
The judges will be sitting down
in my restaurant at 25,

41:21.963 --> 41:23.965
and I'll see to
that happening.

41:23.998 --> 41:26.901
- Bye, Mark.
- Can't wait to
serve you, Chefs.

41:33.942 --> 41:35.910
- Narrator: Next time...
- Ooh!

41:35.944 --> 41:39.648
- This is going to be fun.
- the judges...

41:39.681 --> 41:41.816
Rocking and rolling, baby.
I love it.

41:41.850 --> 41:43.618
join the hottest challenge...

41:43.652 --> 41:45.654
- Whoo-wee!
- ...of the season.

41:45.687 --> 41:49.824
Fried squash blossom, caviar--
I have to top that.

41:49.858 --> 41:52.927
- And...
- Savory or sweet?

41:52.961 --> 41:55.797
- a divided kitchen...
- This is it. Let's go!

41:55.830 --> 41:57.231
- That is not pretty.
- produces...

41:57.265 --> 41:59.600
- ( bleep ) man.
- ...shocking results.

41:59.634 --> 42:02.103
Gordon:
O-M-G.

42:02.136 --> 42:03.571
What is that?
