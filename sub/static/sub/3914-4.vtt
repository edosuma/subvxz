00:01.585 --> 00:02.574
(GRUNTS)

00:08.425 --> 00:09.835
LUCY: Previously
on Killjoys...

00:09.927 --> 00:11.417
You've been
cleared for Level Four.

00:11.553 --> 00:12.929
Just as soon as you
pass your psych eval.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.135
Go see Pawter.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.255
PAWTER: You need
a RA C-certified doctor.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.382
I'm the only one
around for miles.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.551
You're passing me.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.763
Well, all right.
The Jaqobis brothers
together as Killjoys.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.436
Asking D'avin
to join our team, without
asking me first?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.149
DUTCH: He’s your brother.
/ thought you’d be happy.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.779
He'll probablyjust
leave again once he

00:29.905 --> 00:32.112
finds that
doctor he's tracking.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.956
VENDOR: Hey! Stop him!

00:44.169 --> 00:45.249
(GRUNTS)

00:47.005 --> 00:48.085
JOHN: Tell me
that you got him.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.835
Next time you
tell me to go east,
don't mean west.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.795
JOHN: He didn't get him.
(GRUNTS)

00:53.470 --> 00:55.301
Fine. Plan B.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.466
D'AVIN: What’s Plan B?
The plan where
Dutch and I take over

00:57.599 --> 00:59.430
because you didn't listen
to my directions, Rookie.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.008
No way. It's my first collar.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.351
My call.
My balls.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.183
One, please.
Thank you.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.160
Whoops.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.957
So, if I touch him first,
this could still count
as my first catch, right?

01:29.047 --> 01:31.459
Maybe. Say pretty please.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.666
Touch this.
(GRUNTS)

01:34.011 --> 01:35.171
Bye, hop-bag.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.594
I do not like him.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.966
Then, get him.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.216
Hey! Hey!

01:47.190 --> 01:48.691
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:52.696 --> 01:54.812
Hey! Enzo!
Do you mind?

01:54.990 --> 01:56.150
Sorry.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.867
Smells delicious.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.069
D'AVIN: Lost him.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.905
John, you got
a bead on him?
JOHN: Go west.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.870
Your west,
or a normal person's west?

02:08.337 --> 02:09.577
Funny.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.915
I miss just
shooting people.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.879
They're so much easier to
catch when they're dead.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.545
You're not a soldier
anymore, remember?
You're a Killjoy.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.792
First official
warrant, D'avin.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.718
How do you think a miss
will look to the RAC?

02:19.348 --> 02:21.839
Fail. The answer is fail.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.893
There. Hey.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.268
Welcome to Plan C, bitch.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.813
No.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.687
No, I can't do
another set in West Hole.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.269
Oh, I hear you, man.
But you kind of, uh,
(CLICKS TONGUE)

02:35.405 --> 02:37.896
how do I say this,
chopped up your foreman.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.321
People frown at that.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.524
Nowhere else to go.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.910
Exceptup.
So long, shit-stacks.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.199
Oh, don't do that.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.405
D'AVIN: Screw it,
I'm taking him out.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.747
DUTCH: Stop!

02:50.212 --> 02:52.373
That's a security wire.
Move back.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.083
D'AVIN: Why? What's it do?
(GROANING)

02:57.302 --> 02:58.462
That.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.252
Um...

03:02.599 --> 03:05.056
Level Four warrants are
"live or dead," right?

03:05.143 --> 03:07.304
Yeah. Yeah.
(DEVICE BEEPING)

03:07.604 --> 03:10.596
Dead, it is.
Bellus again.
What's up her skirt today?

03:11.149 --> 03:13.231
We're bringing him in.
Someone get a shovel.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.652
You tagged him, you bag him.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.152
(MIMICKING JOHN)
You tag him, you bag him.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.994
LUCY: We are now 205
minutes behind schedule.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.784
DUTCH AND D'AVIN:
Shut up, Lucy.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.166
(MUSIC PLAYING)

03:35.590 --> 03:36.750
Finally, she shows up.

03:36.842 --> 03:37.957
What's with all
the calls today?

03:38.093 --> 03:39.503
We got the mark.
Like we always do.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.796
Took some doing.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.170
Yeah, we're still
smoothing out the kinks
of working together.

03:43.306 --> 03:46.173
Smooth faster. You've been
requested for a warrant.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.218
Bellus, I'm still
wearing my last warrant.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.973
This one comes
direct from the Nine.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.896
So, I'm expected
to volunteer?

03:52.983 --> 03:54.848
I'd say you're
being volun-told.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.225
Volun-told to do what?

03:56.319 --> 03:57.525
Nothing. We pass.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.316
Enzo Galang. As promised.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.656
Congratulations.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.745
You're getting
Enzo all over my desk.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.990
Dutch, with me.
I'm not changing
my mind.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.239
The Nine are a bunch
of inbred fascist nobles

04:10.333 --> 04:11.664
who think that
just because they
run the Company,

04:11.793 --> 04:12.999
they run the Quad.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.626
Don't they?

04:15.172 --> 04:17.163
Why are you
using the good tea?

04:17.549 --> 04:19.505
And whose perfume
am I smelling?

04:22.846 --> 04:27.010
Forgive me.
I may have sprayed
it on a bit thick.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.805
My sense of smell's
a tad inbred.

04:31.146 --> 04:34.388
BELLUS: May I present
Delle Seyah Kendry
of the Nine.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.726
You couldn't warn me?
And miss all this?

04:39.154 --> 04:41.736
This broker assures me
you are the best
female Killjoy.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.071
lam the best. Period.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.861
I certainly hope so.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.193
Come. I require
your assistance.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.371
To do what?
Prevent a war.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.246
Come, come, come uninvited

04:59.716 --> 05:02.173
Run, run, run
till / find you

05:02.260 --> 05:04.842
/ don’t care which side
that you’re fighting

05:04.930 --> 05:07.512
Gonna get you gone

05:10.227 --> 05:12.684
I need you to transport
a young woman to Qresh.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.182
Provided you can keep
your lovers in check.

05:15.524 --> 05:16.639
Pardon?

05:16.733 --> 05:17.768
DELLE SEYAH: This girl
rarely encounters men.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.017
lt's critical
she's kept unmolested.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.060
I think my lovers
can handle that.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.192
GUARD: All clear.
Leave us.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.286
What I'm about to
tell you is confidential.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.073
Two days ago,
one of our nine clans,

05:35.210 --> 05:38.247
the Lahanis, unexpectedly lost
the last of their line.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.796
As luck would have it,
the family is survived
by one last hope.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.417
An heir, implanted in
a pristine surrogate.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.927
A Leithian Vessel.
I've heard of this practice.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.924
So, are you Nine infertile?

05:52.269 --> 05:53.930
No more or less
than any others.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.269
Butwe of the Nine
find birth gauche.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.806
An unnecessary risk for
our wives and daughters.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.807
So you outsource it.
Why not?

06:00.986 --> 06:02.567
Leithian girls make
excellent Vessels,

06:02.654 --> 06:04.690
raised in an entirely
organic environment.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.146
And what's in it
for the surrogates?

06:06.283 --> 06:07.489
The distinction
of incubating

06:07.617 --> 06:09.653
us future leaders of
the Quad, of course.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.111
I'm guessing
it's not all rosy,

06:13.248 --> 06:14.613
ifyou came
all the way here.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.664
lfthe Lahani line
were to die out,

06:16.793 --> 06:18.033
their lands and Company seat

06:18.128 --> 06:20.414
could be annexed by
any of the other Nine.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.711
The last time such
a thing happened,

06:21.798 --> 06:24.961
the resulting War of the Nines
shook the entire Quad.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.172
So, you want my team to escort
the surrogate to Qresh,

06:28.305 --> 06:30.671
so the heir can inherit
the child's lands and title?

06:30.807 --> 06:33.924
My ancestors began
the Vessel program,

06:34.019 --> 06:35.975
and our line continue
to be its patrons.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.141
Some want the Lahani heir
protected.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.477
Some want him dead.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.518
I must appear to
be non-partisan,

06:44.654 --> 06:47.942
so I need this done
cleanly, quietly.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.574
And no one can know
I was ever involved.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.323
Discretion is my
team's specialty.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.999
Good.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.458
A less discreet
person might ask
why a lowborn Killjoy

07:01.463 --> 07:02.953
possesses
an instrument reserved

07:03.048 --> 07:06.336
for female royalty in
other parts of the J.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.374
It came with the ship.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.340
One question, my lady.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.970
To come
all this way personally,
why the sudden urgency?

07:16.353 --> 07:18.184
Where is the baby?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.555
We have no idea.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.189
LUCY: Approaching Wester/ey.
Initiating descent.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.855
D'AVIN: D-87229.
(CHlMES)

07:30.408 --> 07:33.821
LUCY: Congratulations on
receiving your Reclamation
Agent Certificate.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.371
Level Four.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.408
D’avin Jaqobis.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.531
Well, thank you, ship.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.079
And now,
I need to find someone.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.414
Name input.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.877
Dr. Pim Jaegar.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.921
Searching.
(ALARM BLARING)

07:47.050 --> 07:48.210
Shit.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.381
Yeah. It's
pretty annoying.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.549
Damn it, John.
What did you do?

07:53.682 --> 07:54.888
Changed the mainframe
search parameters

07:55.016 --> 07:56.552
to alert me
in case of a breach.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.974
(ALARM STOPS)

07:59.062 --> 08:00.677
You're the breach.
You set a trap for me.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.057
You say tomato,
I say that's what you get

08:02.190 --> 08:03.896
for not confiding
in your brother.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.397
Ah.
(SIGHS)

08:09.614 --> 08:11.115
It's true.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.941
Who is she?
An army doc.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.035
All I know is
she's in the Quad.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.953
She's why
you're here?
John.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.824
Look, D'av, whatever.
The point is, I'm a Killjoy.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.078
Finding people is
literally what I do.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.623
You won't even tell me
who you're looking for?
That's bullshit.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.962
So, that Delle Seyah seemed
like a piece of work, huh?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.546
(EXHALES)

08:31.928 --> 08:34.044
ljust wish
you'd told me first,
instead of Dutch.

08:36.766 --> 08:40.133
Some things are
easier to tell a stranger
than your little brother.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.557
I got my head a bit scrambled
during my last combat mission.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.604
I think this doctor can help.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.273
That's it.

08:47.485 --> 08:50.602
Don't make a deal. I can
handle this on my own. Okay?

08:51.322 --> 08:52.482
DUTCH: Boys?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.067
With me.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.117
LUCY: Docking at Wester/ey.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.200
What do you mean,
they lost the baby?
How do you lose a baby?

09:01.291 --> 09:04.078
Right? I've met babies.
They're very slow.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.789
Are you done?

09:06.963 --> 09:09.329
Our baby has
not been born yet.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.047
The target
is a surrogate.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.090
The monastery
where she's living
is cloistered.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.463
No men in,
no girls out.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.338
But the abbess
has sent daily health
reports to the Nine.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.631
Last week,
the monastery went dark.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.968
Delle Seyah sent her
people to investigate.

09:25.774 --> 09:26.809
(JOHN SIGHS)

09:28.318 --> 09:29.649
Damn.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.856
And our target?

09:31.988 --> 09:35.025
Missing. The remaining
sisters have all gone
underground.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.483
They won't even
reply to the Nine.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.075
If she won't talk
to her employers,

09:39.162 --> 09:40.527
then how are we
supposed to find her?

09:41.831 --> 09:43.992
With a little help
from our friends.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.958
(MUSIC PLAYING)

09:56.888 --> 09:58.549
Where's your ID, Scarback?

10:02.560 --> 10:04.175
Enjoying your work,
Officer?

10:05.855 --> 10:07.811
I'll be praying
for you tonight.
(BEEPS)

10:10.693 --> 10:12.024
And your family.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.278
DUTCH: Keep sassing them,
and one day,

10:16.366 --> 10:18.357
I'll be bailing
your ass from jail.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.905
Company punks?
They're too scared of my kind.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.541
You look well.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.331
lfeel well.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.751
l'm great, too, by the way.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.291
Is that the new one?

10:32.382 --> 10:33.872
Yeah, I'm the new one.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.041
Nice cape.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.594
So, any news on
the monastery massacre?

10:40.098 --> 10:42.384
One survivor. The abbess.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.632
My people have been
in touch with her.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.762
She says to tell you
that the girl is safe.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.393
Girl's name is Constance.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.637
Once the abbess
heard she was carrying

10:48.731 --> 10:50.722
the last of the Lahani line,
she moved her.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.770
Moved her where?
Safe house.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.735
Only the abbess
and one other sister
knows the location.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.191
This will get you
to the safe house.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.785
The abbess has
one condition.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.583
You trust no one,
tell no one,

11:07.709 --> 11:09.415
until the girl is
safe on Qreshi soil.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.409
I know how to
do myjob, Alvis.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.790
And I'm just
doing mine.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.379
Hang on.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.087
These coordinates
can't be right.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.721
Why? Where are
we heading?

11:31.774 --> 11:33.935
JOHN: I love the badlands.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.437
DUTCH: Just admit it,
John, we're lost.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.489
JOHN: I don't get lost.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.483
Coordinates say
this is the location.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.360
Except it isn't.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.912
This is our fourth jaunt
past that cliff face.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.960
And the
perfect chance to enjoy
a refreshing beverage.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.704
D'AVIN: So, why
can't we just fly in?

11:55.798 --> 11:57.254
Because we can't
take Lucy this deep.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.458
The sand here,
it reflects electromagnetics.

11:59.594 --> 12:02.256
lt fries the navs, whatever.
Besides, wasn't that fun?

12:02.513 --> 12:04.469
DUTCH: Let me
simplify, Rookie.

12:04.599 --> 12:07.306
Bad air make ship go boom.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.427
Badlands are what the
Company leaves behind

12:10.521 --> 12:13.308
after they
strip an area bare.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.141
Hell of a place to
hide a baby maker
for blue bloods.

12:16.486 --> 12:20.525
Clever. Nobody will
think to look in the most
toxic place in the Quad.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.699
Hey. Does that
horizon look hinky?

12:24.827 --> 12:26.863
Whoa, easy with
the technical terms.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.497
He's right.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.080
There's no lichen
growing on the escarpment,

12:31.167 --> 12:32.668
even though it faces south.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.136
Security projection.
Nice eye.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.804
Johnny!

12:53.648 --> 12:55.058
You should see
your guys' faces.
(CHUCKLES)

12:55.358 --> 12:56.689
What's back there?

12:56.818 --> 12:58.024
Just more badlands.
Come on.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.690
Oh, and a giant fortress.
Get the Rambler.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.323
Nice place for
a safe house.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.781
Unless it's
just another trick.
Some tech-mirage.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.910
With a front door?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.908
JOHN: Time to
ring the doorbell.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.622
Ladies first.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.295
Rarely, in my experience.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.872
Then, they're
doing it wrong.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.379
I'll be the lady.
Yes, ma'am.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.552
(EXHALES)

13:28.141 --> 13:29.722
Moment of truth.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.154
This is a bad time
to discover l'm
claustrophobic.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.106
Sure hope they built
this place to code.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.325
Shh. This could be
an ambush, look alive.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.460
Here they are.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.006
This is officially my
favorite ambush ever.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.352
It's okay.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.101
We're here to help.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.686
Are you here to
take us to Qresh?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.101
Which one of you
is Constance?
I am.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.566
Nuns.
With guns.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.033
DUTCH: That's different.
Easy, sisters.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.990
I knew Leith's
silence was a portent.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.370
You're scaring the girls.
Let us explain.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.614
Shut up.

14:32.789 --> 14:33.824
What are you doing?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.492
MOTHER SAL:
They're not here
to rescue us, girl.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.616
They're here to execute you.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.126
Put down the guns.
We work for the RAC.
We have a warrant.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.623
That's bullshit.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.542
Drop them.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.124
You want an act of faith?
Here's one.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.880
I haven't killed you yet.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.631
The abbess sent us.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.134
We're here to extract
the surrogate immediately.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.677
(EXHALES)

14:53.810 --> 14:54.970
JOHN: What's wrong with her?

14:55.144 --> 14:56.224
She's eight months pregnant.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.973
Sister Therese.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.811
Take Constance to her room,
and then check the perimeter.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.605
You.
Dutch.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.485
Tell me about
the others on Leith.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.152
Ladies, be kind
to these rakes.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.038
Apparently, they're
our honored guests.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.169
Well, this
should go well.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.380
Everyone at
the birthing sanctuary?

15:29.512 --> 15:31.002
Except the abbess.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.760
I could have been
there when they attacked.
I could have been killed.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.061
There's a chance
that whoever did it

15:40.189 --> 15:42.305
is heading here now.
We need to evacuate.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.642
Right now?
No. Constance is on bed rest.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.897
She took a turn for the worse
when transferring here.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.109
Aren't we all
safer in here, anyway?

15:51.367 --> 15:54.780
My team's job is
to transport people.
We're very good at it.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.036
I can keep
Constance safe.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.455
MERCENARY: Their tracks
continue through here.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.707
Get the gear.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.082
CLARA: So, you're brothers?

16:09.552 --> 16:10.632
Yeah.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.051
I love brothers.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.888
Do you guys like
being Killjoys?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.557
And flying around
and stuff?

16:19.896 --> 16:22.387
Totally. Stuff is great.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.181
lt's feeding time
in the lion's den.
And you're the meat.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.982
MOTHER SAL: No, you're wrong.
Please,

16:27.153 --> 16:30.065
she has to stabilize
or she could go into labor.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.236
So, stabilize her.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.359
Projection camouflage.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.031
Hermetically sealed
from the elements.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.494
Shock-shielding
on perimeter.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.285
All the precautions
have been taken.
The danger is out there.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.450
ln here,
we are perfectly safe.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.328
(DEVICE BEEPING)

16:47.924 --> 16:49.334
You were saying?

16:50.676 --> 16:53.588
AUTOMATED VOICE: System down.
Security disabled.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.839
Air purifiers compromised.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.262
What's going on?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.089
I bet a bird flew
into the grid again.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.182
Sister Therese is outside,
patrolling the perimeter.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.520
There's no need to panic.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.265
Get the girls to
a more secure place.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.971
Check on Constance.
Lock her down.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.183
Okay, ladies, let's get lower
where it's nice and cool.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.188
l'll monitor the grid.
See if I can boot
it up internally.

17:10.321 --> 17:13.108
You can. Well, lcan.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.777
Then, you'd better
come along.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.109
You go with the girls.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.611
l'll sweep.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.787
Hey.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.288
Don't you think it
would be better if,

17:27.380 --> 17:28.665
you know,
you stayed with them?

17:28.798 --> 17:30.254
VVhy,becausel
have breasts?

17:30.341 --> 17:31.581
Sort of.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.132
Wait, is that,
like, a trick question?

17:33.219 --> 17:34.550
They like you, okay?

17:34.637 --> 17:36.593
You're a big
muscle-y distraction,

17:36.681 --> 17:38.717
and we need that
right now.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.632
Look, our warrant is
for Constance, remember?

17:41.727 --> 17:43.843
And when it comes down to it,
she's the one we need to save.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.098
How do you think
the others will react

17:45.189 --> 17:46.429
once they figure that bit out?

17:46.524 --> 17:48.480
No idea. Neither do you.
Trust me, I know.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.058
I grew up in
a placejust like this.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.528
You grew up in
a fertility cult?

17:51.654 --> 17:53.690
Okay, not exactly like this.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.282
What you'd probably
call a "royal harem."

17:55.449 --> 17:58.191
Long story, another time.
Here's how it works.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.698
Treat people like chattel,
make them fight for approval,

18:00.788 --> 18:02.995
and they will always
turn on one another
in the end.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.448
You've seen them.
They're basically
brainwashed.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.792
And probably really,
really scared.
(SCOFFS)

18:09.046 --> 18:11.253
Not everybody is as
hard as you, Dutch.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.087
I didn't start out this way.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.559
Someone's
patched this together

18:25.646 --> 18:27.261
with fusion gel
and duct tape.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.556
Unconventional.
lt's impressive.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.730
Improvised.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.433
It was you?

18:32.528 --> 18:34.860
l was
re-routing harvest drones
to terrorize my sisters

18:34.947 --> 18:36.562
when lwas knee-high
to a copter pod.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.568
And now you're a surrogate
for Qreshi nobles

18:38.659 --> 18:41.366
who can't, or won't,
make their own babies.
How'd that happen?

18:41.787 --> 18:43.402
Constance, Clara, Gwen,

18:43.497 --> 18:45.283
we're all daughters
of farmers on Leith

18:45.374 --> 18:47.205
who didn't need
any more daughters.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.291
This is how we
serve our families.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.797
Constance. Hi, I'm Dutch.
The lady Killjoy.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.716
I'd get up, but...
I know you're not very well,

19:01.807 --> 19:03.638
but we really need
to leave. Now.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.466
I'm ready.

19:05.728 --> 19:08.140
I may be weak, but this
baby is very strong.

19:08.314 --> 19:12.148
These days,
lfeel him moving a lot.
But he has to wait.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.815
The Lahani heir
is only legitimate

19:13.903 --> 19:16.235
if he's born on Qreshi soil.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.567
Am I boring you?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.694
Sorry. Evaluating security.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.783
Part of my job.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.988
Yes, and listening
to me wax poetic about
my vow of bounty isn't.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.531
I get it.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.457
Your beliefs are
none of my business.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.833
I'm the only one of
the girls that was able to
conceive this round.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.500
That's great.

19:35.591 --> 19:40.335
No, I need to see it through.
That's not faith, it's fact.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.759
Oh, you need a dirk.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.683
You're bossy.
You're also right.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.931
So, we all took and passed
the purity test together.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.263
It takes a lot of sacrifices
to be fit for service.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.643
No booze, no boys, no flesh.
Not even bacon.

19:56.779 --> 20:00.692
No room for a career.
No chance to build your
own copter pods. Why?

20:01.283 --> 20:02.784
Traditions die hard.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.409
You know the old joke.
What do you get when you
scratch a Leithian?

20:05.496 --> 20:06.531
What?

20:06.622 --> 20:09.364
A Qreshi ancestor
who's embarrassed to be there.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.783
We're all descendants
of some Qreshi
fourth or fifth son,

20:12.878 --> 20:14.414
sent to Leith
when land got scarce.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.042
Some see honor
in keeping that
connection alive.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.628
So, what do you get when
you scratch a Westerlyn?

20:19.802 --> 20:21.212
Scabies?

20:22.138 --> 20:23.298
(CHUCKLES) Sorry.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.424
No, it's okay,
we just dock there.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.804
Anyway,

20:25.891 --> 20:28.473
my family gets
paid three times
for my honor,

20:28.686 --> 20:31.143
what I'd make as
an engineer, so...

20:32.064 --> 20:33.144
Maybe you're underestimating

20:33.232 --> 20:35.223
how good an engineer
you could have been.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.061
I've thought about it.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.148
Look, those girls
are my real family now.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.979
I'd do anything for them.

20:42.742 --> 20:46.234
Please don't tell them
that I sometimes have doubts.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.737
Not even ifthey
bribe me with bacon.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.998
DUTCH: Where have you been?
I told you to stay with her.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.916
I know how to
protect my girls.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.710
I've been doing it
for 23 years, missy.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.497
(FOOTSTEPS THUDDING)

21:00.217 --> 21:02.208
Did you bring
someone up with you?

21:03.387 --> 21:06.049
Stay with Constance.
For real this time.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.176
Lock the doors.
I'll be right back.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.474
And I mean now.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.940
I always
wanted a big brother.
You two close?

21:18.027 --> 21:19.858
Well, we used to be.

hiding from my secrets.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.028
We just met and I
know your blood type

21:26.118 --> 21:27.574
and why you don't like pie.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.494
Be cake or be pudding.
But commit.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.410
Why, yes. I'd love to dance.

So do |. (GRUNTS)

something really wrong.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.676
Look, a short this
size is only possible
if the surge was external.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.382
Big. Deliberate.
Not a bird?

21:51.477 --> 21:54.059
More like a satellite.
I can override the system,
but...

21:57.650 --> 22:00.016
Who sent you? Leith
nationalists or the Nine?

You are
a special snowflake,

22:18.295 --> 22:20.411
We weren't down
for long.
By my count,

22:21.423 --> 22:23.584
eleven minutes
without security.
That's long enough.

22:23.676 --> 22:24.791
For what?

22:24.885 --> 22:26.671
For whoever cut the power
to get inside.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.221
Whoever's paying,
we'll double it.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.986

is the Lahani breeder.

22:49.827 --> 22:52.409
Send her outside and
no one else will die.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.579

I offered him more money.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.356
A true merc would have
at least heard me out.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.983
Look at his hands, his gear.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.445
This is pure Qreshi
house guard in disguise.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.572
No colors, no crests.

23:37.666 --> 23:41.033
So, no way to tell
which of the Nine families
he was working for. Great.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.954
I'm going
out there.
No, you're not.

What the hell am I watching?

23:52.181 --> 23:55.673
Clara, let her go.
Jenny, put on your
damn shoe. And you,

exactly zero percent.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.641
Sorry, D'avin.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.563
Apology accepted, Clara.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.353
Now, go get Constance.

Can we get to
your ship already?

a few miles away.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.025
Through the badlands?

24:15.245 --> 24:17.281
No. Surrogates can't
breathe Westerlyn air.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.034
It will negate
Constance's status.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.375
So will dying.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.415
We can get halfway there
through the tunnels.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.170
Stop.
I'm sorry,

But if the brigands
get in here,

24:28.842 --> 24:30.924
it's rape and
murder for everyone.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.669
They shot Sister
Therese in the head.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.800
I never took you
for a coward.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.802
Yeah. Cowards survive.

to Qreshis isn't a
higher calling.

to get control of your wombs.

would go full bitch.

Just didn't think it
would be Mother lnferior.

the rest of us stand a chance.

do that to you now.

and it matters to me.

get a say in that,
and neither do you.

Okay. Good.

You failed me, Killjoy.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.684
I will not soon forget it.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.273
We're going in.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.985
Dutch,
there's bending the law,
and then there's breaking it.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.611
Shields still at 90%.

33:16.578 --> 33:17.818
We are talking about
going up against the Nine.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.198
Against Delle Seyah.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.325
She could have us
staked in Black Rain, Dutch.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.372
And by the time
she's done with us,
we might be begging to be.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.826
If she didn't want
us to finish the job,
she shouldn't have hired me.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.752
And the last thing
she wants is publicity.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.454
Constance, two more minutes.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.881
Let that baby
know who's boss.
And hold on.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.506
LUCY: John, we have
Company ships on our tail.

33:36.598 --> 33:37.804
BORDER PATROL: Hailing.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.927
You have unlawful/y
entered Qreshi airspace

33:40.018 --> 33:41.974
and will be shot down
if you do not pull up.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.515
Do not attempt to land.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.354
We will execute with impunity.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.690
I respectfully hold
on that, Border Patrol.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.018
We are RAC agents
with an active warrant.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.397
This must be some
sort of mistake.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.320
We're disabling our weaponry.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.444
Let's figure this out.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.621
GUARD:
You, come with me.
Secure the perimeter!

34:12.467 --> 34:13.502
(BABY CRYING)

34:16.888 --> 34:18.753
LUCY: Bio spill in cargo bay.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.762
I'll have a look.
I'm sure everything is fine.

34:42.664 --> 34:45.280
GUARD:
You were told not to land.
My lady was very clear.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.907
We have a valid
RAC warrant.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.412
Which is why your
ship is still intact.

34:48.503 --> 34:52.291
Get back onboard
or I'll splatter this
grass with gray matter.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.584
That's a bit extreme.

34:53.675 --> 34:56.041
I liked it. Felt like it
came from a real place.

34:56.136 --> 34:58.843
We're just here
to drop off some
precious cargo.

34:59.723 --> 35:02.556
Delle Seyah Kendry,
of Land Kendry.

35:02.726 --> 35:06.184
May I introduce the latest
Qreshi citizen.

35:08.315 --> 35:09.805
(BABY CRYING)

35:29.544 --> 35:31.626
Trueborn,
on mother soil.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.912
Your soil.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.999
Thanks to you,
the Lahani line lives on.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.511
Praise the trees.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.855
The Nine are whole again.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.329
Welcome home,
little one.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.498
(COOING)

36:13.338 --> 36:15.044
I've overlooked
that the surrogates

36:15.131 --> 36:16.871
breathed
polluted Westerley air.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.582
As far as
everyone else knows,

36:18.677 --> 36:20.918
the girls remain
100% pure.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.544
Well, I imagine
that's to your advantage,

36:22.639 --> 36:24.630
now that you're
the heir's legal guardian.

36:26.643 --> 36:30.386
You, uh, made me a few
enemies tonight.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.521
Reckless move,
forcing my hand.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.018
Not really.

36:35.360 --> 36:39.023
When your
enemy has two faces,
strike a deal with both.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.109
(CHUCKLES)

36:43.118 --> 36:44.983
You can't be serious.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.901
You've read Derhlek?

36:46.996 --> 36:48.907
Only the simple words.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.281
Well, go on, then.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.746
Amuse me, Killjoy.

36:54.087 --> 36:55.952
What are my two faces?

36:56.131 --> 36:57.587
By my count,

36:57.799 --> 37:01.132
you're a decent person
genuinely trying to
protect the surrogates.

37:02.262 --> 37:07.222
Or a ruthless politician
who either used me
to find the girls

37:07.308 --> 37:08.639
so that you could
attack them,

37:08.727 --> 37:10.718
or cut a deal with
the persons who did.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.099
What's your bet?

37:13.398 --> 37:14.763
Even odds.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.231
But I can make
either work.

37:17.777 --> 37:22.396
If you are a decent person,
the baby is safe.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.739
And if I'm
a scheming opportunist?

37:24.826 --> 37:26.487
He's even safer.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.577
Qreshis can't bequeath land
until they turn 18,

37:29.664 --> 37:31.780
and you've no claim
to his without him.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.407
So, good or evil,

37:34.836 --> 37:36.167
it's now in your
best interest to do

37:36.296 --> 37:38.503
everything in your power
to keep him safe.

37:38.840 --> 37:43.675
Well, aren't you a pearl
hiding in the muck.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.425
Thank you?

37:45.513 --> 37:47.344
It's a compliment.

37:47.974 --> 37:50.010
You have an unusual
grasp of statecraft,

37:50.101 --> 37:52.012
for a woman with
calloused hands.

37:53.188 --> 37:56.100
I could use someone
of your complexity.

37:59.360 --> 38:03.023
Now, get off my property
before I have you shot.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.204
I like her.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.666
Find out
everything you can.

38:23.384 --> 38:27.218
That was the most
painful, terrifying
experience of my life.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.388
Why can't I stop staring
at his fingernails?

38:30.517 --> 38:33.008
I've heard they've asked you
to stay on as his nanny.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.227
I always hoped they would.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.063
He was never really mine,
but I hoped Iwould stay
in his life,

38:40.318 --> 38:42.229
teach him about my home.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.478
Help raise a Qreshi leader
who understands Leith.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.564
There's certainly time.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.740
I need you to take
Clara and I home.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.577
Yourfarm?
No.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.908
That's not my home anymore.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.834
Don't say you're
staying a Vessel.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.207
No.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.216
A guardian.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.420
Coach other girls
through this honor.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.921
You know it's not honor.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.669
It's whatever
we make of it.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.845
You asked me to
figure out what I want.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.932
This is what I want.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.426
Someone has to
protect the Vessels

39:16.563 --> 39:19.771
for as long as
the girls are called to serve.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.569
And after everything
they gave up for me,

39:24.779 --> 39:27.191
how could I
abandon my sisters?

39:29.242 --> 39:30.903
They'll be lucky
to have you.

39:35.290 --> 39:36.700
You ready?

39:37.917 --> 39:38.952
No.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.797
(COOING)

39:56.436 --> 39:58.472
(DOOR OPENING)

40:00.565 --> 40:02.647
Girls are finally asleep.

40:03.443 --> 40:04.808
Algae brew?

40:06.237 --> 40:08.444
She was on Qresh.
The capital city.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.484
Madidus.

40:11.784 --> 40:12.910
Who?

40:13.119 --> 40:14.575
Dr. Jaegar.

40:17.790 --> 40:18.916
Was?

40:19.250 --> 40:20.490
There's no sign of her
after she stepped off

40:20.585 --> 40:22.075
the transport that
brought her to this system.

40:22.170 --> 40:26.664
But someone, they paid
significant joy for
a solid cleanup job.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.585
So, that's it.

40:30.011 --> 40:32.548
VVeH,shethave
left a trail, a clue.
I mean, they always do.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.591
I didn't ask for
your help, John.
What?

40:34.766 --> 40:37.007
Yeah, but you
should have, dipshit.
I'm your brother.

40:39.354 --> 40:43.313
This doc, can she fix you?

40:47.654 --> 40:48.814
I don't know. Maybe.
Okay.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.566
So then,
we search, we find out.

40:50.698 --> 40:51.858
But Dutch has to be in on it.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.902
She's family, too.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.404
Okay.

40:57.163 --> 41:00.030
Meaning don't plow our sister.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.662
Remind me. Was that on
the Jaqobis family crest?

41:04.545 --> 41:06.285
I've seen how
you look at her.

41:06.381 --> 41:09.714
D'av, this is almost working.
We are a good team, (SIGHS)

41:12.720 --> 41:16.713
but we could be great.
So, don't mess that up for us.

41:17.517 --> 41:18.882
I won't.

41:19.394 --> 41:20.509
I promise.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.013
DUTCH: Promise what?

41:23.731 --> 41:26.438
That next time I get to
pick the damn warrant.

41:36.202 --> 41:38.784
I, uh, got to go do a thing.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.743
I don't know exactly
what happened to you

41:46.879 --> 41:50.042
in that rich kid
orphanage of yours.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.841
But you came out
the other side clean.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.919
Don't ever think otherwise.
