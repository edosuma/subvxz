08:28.133 --> 08:29.427
You talking crazy.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.303
We watch that video every

08:29.468 --> 08:31.303
year since you was born.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.471
But we can skip this year.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.681
How about--

08:32.512 --> 08:34.681
[whispers] Help me.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.100
Hi everybody.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.060
Daddy, we really gotta

08:36.141 --> 08:38.060
upgrade you on that camera.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.312
It's the best investment

08:38.102 --> 08:40.312
that I ever made this camera.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.188
VHS?

08:44.566 --> 08:46.485
<i>Get that God damn</i>

08:44.566 --> 08:46.485
<i>camera out of my face</i>

08:46.526 --> 08:47.486
<i>and help me you idiot.</i>

08:47.527 --> 08:48.946

09:00.958 --> 09:02.960

09:03.461 --> 09:05.045
[screaming]

09:07.631 --> 09:08.799
[thuds]

09:08.840 --> 09:09.591
Oh my God.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.177
Baby, hey, Tasha.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.596
-Baby, hey, hey.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.596
-What happened?

09:14.638 --> 09:15.597
[Brenda] Could

09:14.638 --> 09:15.597
somebody get some water?

09:15.639 --> 09:16.556
Tasha?

09:18.642 --> 09:19.935
-[Bernie]<i> Hey listen.</i>

09:18.642 --> 09:19.935
-[Tasha]<i> Hmm.</i>

09:19.977 --> 09:24.398
<i>-Um...</i>

09:19.977 --> 09:24.398
-What?

09:24.440 --> 09:25.607
I think you should

09:24.440 --> 09:25.607
take one of those

09:25.649 --> 09:28.402
home pregnancy tests.

09:28.444 --> 09:32.572
Oh, Bernie. Honey for what?

09:32.614 --> 09:36.994
Seven years of being told

09:32.614 --> 09:36.994
that my eggs aren't fertile?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.413
Bernie, a baby isn't

09:37.035 --> 09:39.413
possible for us.

09:39.455 --> 09:42.249
Well, babe I get

09:39.455 --> 09:42.249
all that, but look...

09:44.001 --> 09:46.378
You threw up at school,

09:44.001 --> 09:46.378
you passed out at the party

09:46.420 --> 09:49.173
and your cycle is late.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.383
Isn't that what happen to a

09:49.214 --> 09:51.383
woman when she's pregnant?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.177
It's impossible.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.012
Okay, how late are you?

09:56.805 --> 09:59.641
-Two weeks.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.641
-See, two-- Come on.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.601
-What?

09:59.683 --> 10:01.601
-Just take the test, baby.

10:01.643 --> 10:05.689
Honey, if I am pregnant, I

10:01.643 --> 10:05.689
need a doctor to confirm it.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.275
Honey, listen it's almost

10:05.730 --> 10:08.275
time for my annual exam,

10:08.317 --> 10:11.028
I'll just get the

10:08.317 --> 10:11.028
full work up, okay?

10:11.069 --> 10:12.488
-Yeah?

10:11.069 --> 10:12.488
-That work?

10:12.530 --> 10:13.905
-That works.

10:12.530 --> 10:13.905
-Good.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.615
Good, all right.

10:18.369 --> 10:19.619
Get some rest.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.124
Okay, fine so

10:21.705 --> 10:24.124
let's play what if.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.543
Are you ready?

10:25.584 --> 10:26.335
Do I have a choice.

10:26.377 --> 10:28.920
-No. Okay.

10:26.377 --> 10:28.920
-Okay.

10:28.962 --> 10:34.676
What if, by some divine

10:28.962 --> 10:34.676
intervention, I am pregnant?

10:34.718 --> 10:36.720
-Hmm.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.720
-Mm-hmm.

10:36.761 --> 10:41.766
Would you want a baby

10:36.761 --> 10:41.766
boy or a baby girl?

10:43.185 --> 10:45.145
[chuckles]

10:43.185 --> 10:45.145
Well...

10:45.187 --> 10:48.357
Yeah, I don't know. It

10:45.187 --> 10:48.357
doesn't really matter.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.150
I just want a healthy baby.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.110
Boy, stop playing.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.322
You know you want a boy. You

10:52.152 --> 10:55.322
know you want a baby boy.

10:55.364 --> 10:58.576
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I

10:55.364 --> 10:58.576
mean, I admit I would...

10:59.743 --> 11:01.703
have a little more

10:59.743 --> 11:01.703
in common with a boy.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.121
Mm-hmm, just a little.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.122
Just a little bit.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.707
[laughs]

11:05.749 --> 11:11.088
-If he was anything like me

11:05.749 --> 11:11.088
he'd have that throwing arm.

11:05.749 --> 11:11.088
-Mm-hmm.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.090
I'd train him all

11:11.129 --> 11:13.090
the way up to the NFL.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.341
Aww.

11:14.758 --> 11:15.926
[gasps]

11:15.967 --> 11:18.720
And he could buy us a

11:15.967 --> 11:18.720
big house in the Hamptons.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.348
Where all the rich people live.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.141
We could go to all

11:21.390 --> 11:23.141
the dinner parties,

11:23.183 --> 11:26.895
and sip on our wine, and um...

11:23.183 --> 11:26.895
I would develop an accent,

11:26.937 --> 11:28.313
and I would go

11:26.937 --> 11:28.313
around saying things

11:28.355 --> 11:31.900
like um... "Lovely weather

11:28.355 --> 11:31.900
we're having, darling."

11:31.942 --> 11:33.527
Right, right?

11:33.569 --> 11:34.736
"How do you do?

11:34.778 --> 11:36.071
How do you do?

11:36.113 --> 11:38.323
How is the weather; Crisp

11:36.113 --> 11:38.323
and clean and fresh?"

11:38.365 --> 11:39.783
-Right.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.783
-You see I talk well?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.535
Yeah, yeah you

11:39.824 --> 11:41.535
gonna talk like that?

11:41.577 --> 11:43.120
You gonna have to do that on

11:41.577 --> 11:43.120
the other side of the room.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.123
Oh. And you don't

11:43.161 --> 11:46.123
drink wine so...

11:46.164 --> 11:48.542
-I bet I would start.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.542
-Right.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.545
When you're paying a hundred

11:48.584 --> 11:51.545
dollars a bottle, or a sip?

11:51.587 --> 11:52.712
-Shoot.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.712
-[laughs]

11:54.798 --> 11:59.303
Okay so, what if we had a girl.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.763
Oh, a baby girl?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.763
She'd be so cute.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.098
Yeah.

12:03.140 --> 12:08.103
I don't know maybe she

12:03.140 --> 12:08.103
would become president.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.521
Yes.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.731
And bring about world peace.

12:11.773 --> 12:12.524
I like that.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.775
-You like that?

12:12.566 --> 12:13.775
-Mm-hmm.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.777
Mmm.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.777
[gasps] Oh.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.323
Namaste.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.785
I'm pretty sure your using

12:20.824 --> 12:23.785
that word in the wrong context.

12:23.827 --> 12:28.332
I told you I just like

12:23.827 --> 12:28.332
saying it, joy stealer.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.334
All right, you keep saying

12:28.373 --> 12:30.334
it. Say it real low

12:30.375 --> 12:31.293
'cause I'm going to sleep.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.503
Stop.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.754
-Go to bed lady, goodness.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.754
-Whatever.

12:35.339 --> 12:38.425
Well Tasha, we're all done

12:35.339 --> 12:38.425
with your annual physical,

12:38.467 --> 12:40.010
we have your blood work,

12:40.051 --> 12:42.220
but because of your family's

12:40.051 --> 12:42.220
history with breast cancer...

12:42.262 --> 12:44.640
Ah, let me guess, you

12:42.262 --> 12:44.640
need me to go to radiology

12:44.682 --> 12:46.433
next door for my mammogram?

12:46.475 --> 12:47.476
Precisely.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.646
I've been getting mammograms

12:48.852 --> 12:50.646
for the past five years

12:50.688 --> 12:53.023
Doctor Bailey, I

12:50.688 --> 12:53.023
know the routine.

12:53.064 --> 12:56.818
But those machines, oh my God,

12:53.064 --> 12:56.818
they are so uncomfortable.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.446
I know that mammograms

12:56.860 --> 12:59.446
can be uncomfortable,

12:59.488 --> 13:01.823
but because you carry the

12:59.488 --> 13:01.823
mutated gene for breast cancer,

13:01.865 --> 13:03.659
it's really important

13:01.865 --> 13:03.659
that you get your checkups

13:03.701 --> 13:05.285
at this early age.

13:06.662 --> 13:07.663
Understood.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.794
But what if I am pregnant?

13:16.463 --> 13:19.424
I mean is it okay for me to

13:16.463 --> 13:19.424
get a mammogram right now?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.843
With all that radiation,

13:19.466 --> 13:21.843
it's just-- I don't--

13:21.885 --> 13:24.429
Normally, mammograms

13:21.885 --> 13:24.429
are safe during pregnancy

13:24.471 --> 13:27.015
because the amount of

13:24.471 --> 13:27.015
radiation is minimal.

13:27.057 --> 13:30.644
But Tasha, I don't want

13:27.057 --> 13:30.644
you getting your hopes up.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.437
Your chances are less

13:30.686 --> 13:32.437
than five percent

13:32.479 --> 13:34.439
of becoming pregnant.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.816
Your eggs just aren't fertile.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.986
[dramatic music]

13:40.028 --> 13:40.820
I got it.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.198
I know.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.409
Are you gonna be okay?

13:45.450 --> 13:48.245
I will be. [laughs]

13:48.286 --> 13:51.831
Okay well, get dressed

13:48.286 --> 13:51.831
and we'll talk soon okay?

13:51.873 --> 13:53.833
Thank you, Doctor Bailey.

13:58.046 --> 14:01.883
So we get the carpet

13:58.046 --> 14:01.883
out, ready to install it,

14:01.925 --> 14:05.429
and I unroll it and

14:01.925 --> 14:05.429
I see all these cuts,

14:05.470 --> 14:06.638
all through the whole roll,

14:06.680 --> 14:08.265
a whole bunch of

14:06.680 --> 14:08.265
cuts on the carpet.

14:08.306 --> 14:13.270
Yeah, it was completely

14:08.306 --> 14:13.270
ruined. Couldn't use any of it.

14:13.395 --> 14:17.190
The customer was unsatisfied,

14:13.395 --> 14:17.190
of course, for obvious reasons.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.817
And it set me and

14:17.232 --> 14:18.817
Tony back two days,

14:18.858 --> 14:19.984
we'll have to get new carpet

14:20.026 --> 14:21.319
and still have it

14:20.026 --> 14:21.319
installed on time.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.071
-Hmm.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.071
-It's crazy.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.657
Tasha?

14:26.866 --> 14:27.618
Baby?

14:27.659 --> 14:29.202
What's up?

14:29.244 --> 14:30.621
Have you listened

14:29.244 --> 14:30.621
to a word I said?

14:30.662 --> 14:34.291
Yeah, you said, "carpet,

14:30.662 --> 14:34.291
slices, pushback."

14:34.332 --> 14:35.125
Right.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.629
It's this funny thing about me

14:36.668 --> 14:38.629
though, you know, it's like

14:38.670 --> 14:43.467
when I talk to someone, I like

14:38.670 --> 14:43.467
when they interact with me, so.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.595
-Honey, I'm sorry.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.595
-Hmm.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.388
I don't know. I've just been

14:46.637 --> 14:48.388
having so much on my mind

14:48.430 --> 14:49.807
and of course I'm tired,

14:49.848 --> 14:51.391
I don't know what's

14:49.848 --> 14:51.391
going on with me.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.602
Well, thinking about

14:51.433 --> 14:53.602
the test results

14:53.644 --> 14:55.186
is not gonna make the

14:53.644 --> 14:55.186
phone ring any faster.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.020
Yeah.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.190
[door bell rings]

14:59.232 --> 15:02.193
Well, it did make something

14:59.232 --> 15:02.193
ring now didn't it?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.696
-Mm, mm, mm.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.696
-Yeah, you're funny. Not really.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.739
[laughs]

15:06.657 --> 15:07.866
-Be right back.

15:06.657 --> 15:07.866
-Mm-hmm.

15:10.994 --> 15:11.829
[door thuds]

15:11.870 --> 15:13.204
We have a guest.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.038
Hey.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.793
Just thought I'd come by

15:15.666 --> 15:17.793
and see how she was doing.

15:17.835 --> 15:19.961
Oh, I'm doing good

15:17.835 --> 15:19.961
Daddy, much better.

15:20.003 --> 15:20.962
How you doing, young man?

15:21.004 --> 15:22.589
I'm good man, we

15:21.004 --> 15:22.589
just having dinner.

15:22.631 --> 15:23.965
Good.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.383
'Cause I am hungry.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.427
Oh, I'll get you a bowl.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.807
So, Bernie informed me

15:29.471 --> 15:31.807
that the other night

15:31.849 --> 15:34.976

15:31.849 --> 15:34.976

-Mm-hmm.

15:40.190 --> 15:44.152
Well, she says

15:40.190 --> 15:44.152
that she can't stand

15:44.194 --> 15:47.989
the fact that you always

15:44.194 --> 15:47.989
gotta video tape everything.

15:48.031 --> 15:48.990
I don't video everything.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.785
I just video the

15:49.032 --> 15:51.785
important stuff.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.995
So, me passing out at

15:51.827 --> 15:53.995

15:54.037 --> 15:56.164
Well, yeah.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.999
Daddy, come on,

15:56.206 --> 15:57.999
that is embarrassing.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.001
Don't show that video to anyone.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.003
When you say

16:00.043 --> 16:02.003
anyone, you mean what?

16:02.045 --> 16:03.421
Anyone.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.008
Fine.

16:09.052 --> 16:12.013
But one day, you're gonna

16:09.052 --> 16:12.013
look back at that footage

16:12.055 --> 16:14.015
and you gonna appreciate it.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.018
And then you gonna realize

16:14.057 --> 16:17.018
why I video everything.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.604
Because life is precious, baby,

16:19.646 --> 16:21.398
and I capture those moments

16:21.439 --> 16:24.150
so that you have

16:21.439 --> 16:24.150
something to hold onto.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.778
You even hold onto your

16:24.192 --> 16:26.778
mothers memory because of it.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.364
Yes, Daddy, and I

16:26.820 --> 16:29.364
do appreciate it,

16:29.406 --> 16:32.992
but video of me fainting

16:29.406 --> 16:32.992
needs to be destroyed.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.370
Have you gone to

16:34.411 --> 16:35.370
the doctor to find out

16:35.412 --> 16:36.371
why you passed out?

16:36.413 --> 16:40.584
Yes, and we're

16:36.413 --> 16:40.584
waiting on the results.

16:40.625 --> 16:45.171
Well, Brenda and I think it's

16:40.625 --> 16:45.171
because you don't eat right.

told me anything about sex.

was from a song called

No, I'm not saying that at all.

preformed to determine that.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.131
What I'm saying is

22:17.545 --> 22:20.131
that Tasha has a mass,

22:20.173 --> 22:22.341
and as you both already know

22:20.173 --> 22:22.341
she carries a mutated gene.

22:22.383 --> 22:24.719
The BRCA1 she inherited

22:22.383 --> 22:24.719
from her mother.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.721
This mutation causes

22:24.761 --> 22:26.721
a greater risk

22:26.763 --> 22:28.973
of developing breast cancer.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.349
Okay, but...

22:32.518 --> 22:34.896
but, she can get the biopsy back

22:34.938 --> 22:37.899
and find out the

22:34.938 --> 22:37.899
mass isn't cancerous,

22:37.941 --> 22:40.401
and she and the baby

22:37.941 --> 22:40.401
will be fine, right?

22:40.443 --> 22:41.903
Yes, of course.

22:41.945 --> 22:44.405
The mass can be benign.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.324

22:46.365 --> 22:49.327
If it's malignant,

22:46.365 --> 22:49.327
then your oncologist will

22:49.368 --> 22:50.411
the next steps.

22:50.453 --> 22:54.415
No, no, Doc, you could

22:50.453 --> 22:54.415
just tell us right now.

23:24.362 --> 23:27.115
depending on the

23:24.362 --> 23:27.115
stage that it's in,

23:27.157 --> 23:28.449
then your

23:27.157 --> 23:28.449
oncologist might suggest

23:28.491 --> 23:30.118
that you terminate the pregnancy

23:30.160 --> 23:33.121

32:45.756 --> 32:47.925
invisible to you.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.092
Invisible?

32:49.134 --> 32:50.010
You're standing

32:49.134 --> 32:50.010
right in front of me.

32:50.052 --> 32:51.094
Do you see me?

32:51.136 --> 32:54.515
'Cause I feel like I'm

32:51.136 --> 32:54.515
standing in Patricia's shadow.

32:54.557 --> 32:56.726
Nothing I do is ever

32:54.557 --> 32:56.726
good enough for you.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.018
Not when I helped you take care

32:58.060 --> 33:00.103
of my best friend

32:58.060 --> 33:00.103
until her death.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.022
Not even when I

33:00.145 --> 33:02.022
helped you raise Tasha

33:02.064 --> 33:03.399
while I'm raising my own boys.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.027
Not once have I ever

33:03.440 --> 33:07.027
felt appreciated.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.822
We're in a relationship Brenda,

33:07.069 --> 33:09.822
that's not enough for you?

33:09.864 --> 33:11.198
No, it's not.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.408
Then what do you

33:11.240 --> 33:12.408
want from me, huh?

33:12.449 --> 33:14.034
A thank you?

33:14.076 --> 33:15.244
Do you love me?

33:17.454 --> 33:19.206
My only child

33:17.454 --> 33:19.206
just walked in here

33:19.248 --> 33:21.625
and told me she

33:19.248 --> 33:21.625
has breast cancer

33:21.667 --> 33:23.419
and she's foregoing treatment

33:23.460 --> 33:26.046
for a child she may never raise.

33:27.464 --> 33:30.634
Every bit of love,

33:27.464 --> 33:30.634
every bit of support,

33:30.676 --> 33:33.637
every bit of strength,

33:30.676 --> 33:33.637
everything I have in me

33:33.679 --> 33:36.181
is going to my daughter.

33:36.223 --> 33:39.226
You either accept that, or not.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.020
I'm going to bed.

33:53.115 --> 33:56.410
-[dramatic music]

33:53.115 --> 33:56.410
-[crying]

33:56.452 --> 33:58.078
[knocking]

33:58.120 --> 34:01.039
[Melvin]<i> Tasha baby,</i>

33:58.120 --> 34:01.039
<i>please open the door.</i>

34:02.458 --> 34:04.084
Tasha's in the bathroom,

34:02.458 --> 34:04.084
she won't come out.

34:04.126 --> 34:06.295
I didn't know what to

34:04.126 --> 34:06.295
do so I called you.

34:06.336 --> 34:10.007
It's fine. She's 12 years old.

34:10.048 --> 34:14.094
If she's not coming out of the

34:10.048 --> 34:14.094
bathroom it's for one reason.

34:14.136 --> 34:18.056
Sanitary napkins. She's

34:14.136 --> 34:18.056
crossed over into womanhood.

34:19.308 --> 34:21.101
How could I not know that?

34:21.143 --> 34:23.520
Don't beat

34:21.143 --> 34:23.520
yourself up about it.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.565
Tasha honey, it's Brenda.

34:27.858 --> 34:28.859
Can I come in?

34:30.444 --> 34:32.446
[creaks]

34:35.658 --> 34:37.618
I'll be in the kitchen.

34:37.660 --> 34:38.661
It'll be fine.

34:38.702 --> 34:39.536
Yeah.

34:42.039 --> 34:44.625
[water splashing]

34:46.418 --> 34:47.711
She's growing up.

34:48.838 --> 34:51.131
Best to let her stay

34:48.838 --> 34:51.131
home from school today.

34:51.173 --> 34:52.967
Experiencing that

34:51.173 --> 34:52.967
for the first time

34:53.009 --> 34:54.677
can be a little traumatic.

34:54.718 --> 34:55.678
Thank you, Brenda.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.095
Mm-hmm. No problem.

35:01.141 --> 35:03.978
[sighs] You know,

35:04.020 --> 35:06.146
with Patricia

35:04.020 --> 35:06.146
gone I just feel as though

35:06.188 --> 35:08.524
there's so much

35:06.188 --> 35:08.524
she's missing out on

35:08.565 --> 35:09.817
that I can't give to her.

35:09.859 --> 35:11.151
Well, I'm not her mother,

35:11.193 --> 35:14.613
but I'm always here

35:11.193 --> 35:14.613
to help you with her.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.198
I don't want to burden you.

35:16.239 --> 35:19.117
It's no burden.

35:16.239 --> 35:19.117
I can help her.

35:20.995 --> 35:21.996
And you.

35:24.832 --> 35:27.417
[dramatic music]

35:30.212 --> 35:32.172
-I can't.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.172
-Yes, you can.

35:32.214 --> 35:35.051
[dramatic music]

35:41.640 --> 35:42.432
Melvin.

35:44.434 --> 35:47.021
You're a man with needs.

35:47.063 --> 35:49.439
I'm a woman with the same needs.

35:51.233 --> 35:54.152
My needs are taken

35:51.233 --> 35:54.152
care of just fine.

35:55.696 --> 35:58.156
Oh, I see.

35:59.909 --> 36:03.871
So, you can be with other

35:59.909 --> 36:03.871
women, just not me. Is that it?

36:03.913 --> 36:06.456
Brenda, it's not

36:03.913 --> 36:06.456
easy for you and me.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.251
You were her best friend.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.878
It's been four years.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.089
You think I don't know that?

36:13.130 --> 36:17.885
She's gone Melvin, and

36:13.130 --> 36:17.885
I'm here, and I love you.

36:17.927 --> 36:19.469
And that little girl upstairs,

36:19.511 --> 36:21.847
-I love her like she's my own.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.847
-I know that.

36:21.889 --> 36:22.848
Then why?

36:22.890 --> 36:24.850
I just-- Look I

36:22.890 --> 36:24.850
just can't, okay?

36:24.892 --> 36:26.852
Can't is not a reason.

36:26.894 --> 36:28.228
Why don't you just

36:26.894 --> 36:28.228
consider the fact that--

36:28.270 --> 36:31.690
Look, I'm still in

36:28.270 --> 36:31.690
love with my wife, okay?

36:33.109 --> 36:36.862
Look, I don't want

36:33.109 --> 36:36.862
to hurt you, Brenda.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.238
I took care of her

36:36.904 --> 36:38.238
when that cancer

36:38.280 --> 36:40.198
was just eating her away.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.244
I did everything I

36:41.700 --> 36:44.244
could to keep her here.

36:44.286 --> 36:47.456
Because Tasha needed her mother.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.458
I took care of her too.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.501
I was right there with you.

36:52.836 --> 36:56.715
So you expect me to just

36:52.836 --> 36:56.715
make love to her best friend?

36:56.757 --> 36:57.758
Yes.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.720
You just don't understand.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.639
I can't betray

37:01.762 --> 37:03.639
Patricia like that.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.266
You can't betray a dead woman.

37:08.477 --> 37:12.856
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.985
Look, I know she's dead, okay?

37:16.026 --> 37:19.279
And she's not coming back.

37:19.321 --> 37:24.660
And you're a beautiful

37:19.321 --> 37:24.660
woman. Any man would be

37:19.321 --> 37:24.660
lucky to have you.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.286
But I'm not gonna sit here

37:26.328 --> 37:30.707
and pretend that I want any

37:26.328 --> 37:30.707
more from you than friendship.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.751
I don't need anymore friends.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.883
I can't do this anymore.

37:41.343 --> 37:45.889
Brenda, don't leave.

37:41.343 --> 37:45.889
Tasha needs you.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.893
If only you needed me too.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.270
[dramatic music]

37:53.313 --> 37:55.691
[door clatters]

38:02.572 --> 38:03.573
Hey.

38:04.366 --> 38:05.617
Hey.

38:05.659 --> 38:09.329
I have a sonogram

38:05.659 --> 38:09.329
appointment this morning.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.456
You think you could make it?

38:13.834 --> 38:19.256
Um, yeah, I don't think so

38:13.834 --> 38:19.256
babe. I don't think I can.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.465
Could you try?

38:23.177 --> 38:24.220
I gotta work.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.471
[clears throat]

38:28.891 --> 38:31.476
[dramatic music]

38:35.939 --> 38:40.861
All right. Okay, thanks

38:35.939 --> 38:40.861
for telling me. Okay.

38:40.903 --> 38:45.032
That was Tasha. She has

38:40.903 --> 38:45.032
a sonogram this morning.

38:45.074 --> 38:47.826
What? You still

38:45.074 --> 38:47.826
not talking to me?

38:47.868 --> 38:49.411
For what?

38:49.452 --> 38:51.329
I don't have anything to say.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.957
Then don't say

38:51.371 --> 38:53.957
anything.

38:53.999 --> 38:57.211
We just uh...

38:53.999 --> 38:57.211
make up.

38:59.171 --> 39:02.340
Aren't we a little

38:59.171 --> 39:02.340
too old for make up sex?

39:02.382 --> 39:06.344
I don't know.

39:02.382 --> 39:06.344
Tell me when we're finished.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.972
[dramatic music]

39:11.725 --> 39:13.393
The gel is warm.

39:13.435 --> 39:14.352
Okay.

39:18.398 --> 39:19.775
Oh.

39:18.398 --> 39:19.775
[laughs]

39:23.112 --> 39:25.530
All right, here we go.

39:29.952 --> 39:30.953
There.

39:32.454 --> 39:35.415
[laughs] It looks like a

39:32.454 --> 39:35.415
little kidney bean.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.167
[laughs]

39:37.209 --> 39:40.003
Yes, that's what it's supposed

39:37.209 --> 39:40.003
to look like at this gestation.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.297
Wow.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.465
Well, is everything okay,

39:41.713 --> 39:43.465
is the heart beating?

39:43.506 --> 39:46.302
Heart beat is strong.

39:46.343 --> 39:47.427
You're about 11 weeks along.

39:47.469 --> 39:49.721
[laughing]

39:54.143 --> 39:56.436
Miss Jackson, are you okay?

39:56.478 --> 39:58.897
I wish my husband

39:56.478 --> 39:58.897
was here is all.

39:58.939 --> 40:01.483
We'll print a

39:58.939 --> 40:01.483
picture out for him.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.443
No one wants to do

40:01.524 --> 40:03.443
the first... ya know,

40:03.485 --> 40:04.903
sonogram alone, you know?

40:04.945 --> 40:06.404
Oh yeah, I understand.

40:07.489 --> 40:08.698
Did we miss it?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.492
Oh my God, you're here?

40:10.533 --> 40:16.165
Oh, Brenda and Daddy.

40:10.533 --> 40:16.165
Oh, here you go.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.458
We would have been

40:17.207 --> 40:18.458
here earlier but um--

40:18.500 --> 40:19.709
Traffic.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.295
-Yeah.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.295
-We were caught in traffic.

40:21.337 --> 40:24.089
Yeah, caught in traffic, good

40:21.337 --> 40:24.089
traffic-- I mean, big traffic.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.465
Yeah.

40:25.507 --> 40:26.424
Okay?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.469
All right, let's fire this thing

40:27.926 --> 40:29.469
up so I can see this baby.

40:29.511 --> 40:31.096
[nurse] Oh, yeah, sure thing.

40:31.138 --> 40:33.015
Oh, yeah.

40:33.056 --> 40:36.810
[Melvin] Look, I got the baby

40:33.056 --> 40:36.810
on film before it's even here!

40:36.852 --> 40:38.645
[laughs]

40:38.687 --> 40:41.564
I know. It's so tiny.

40:38.687 --> 40:41.564
[laughs]

40:43.108 --> 40:45.319
Okay, here goes nothing.

40:46.195 --> 40:48.446
[sighs]

40:46.195 --> 40:48.446
[clears throat]

40:48.488 --> 40:54.995
Hello there, um... well, today

40:48.488 --> 40:54.995
has been all in all, uh...

40:55.037 --> 40:56.997
Oh my God.

40:57.039 --> 41:01.168
What the hell am

40:57.039 --> 41:01.168
I trying to say?

41:01.210 --> 41:02.585
Oh, I got it. [clears throat]

41:04.838 --> 41:09.968
All right, um... Hey there

41:04.838 --> 41:09.968
little person, whoever you are.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.512
My name is Tasha, Tasha Jackson

41:12.554 --> 41:18.310
and um...

41:12.554 --> 41:18.310
I recently turned 30 and um...

41:18.352 --> 41:22.522
Damn it. This thing's

41:18.352 --> 41:22.522
not even recording.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.524
Okay, okay here we go.

41:28.695 --> 41:30.488
Hello, little one.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.282
[laughs]

41:32.324 --> 41:34.993
I am your mommy, Tasha,

41:35.035 --> 41:38.997
and right now you

41:35.035 --> 41:38.997
are in my tummy, see?

41:39.039 --> 41:41.041
[laughs]

41:41.583 --> 41:45.545
Um, I am recording this

41:41.583 --> 41:45.545
because apparently

41:45.587 --> 41:48.590
your grandfather Melvin

41:45.587 --> 41:48.590
had it right all along.

41:48.631 --> 41:52.010
Important things should

41:48.631 --> 41:52.010
be captured on film.

41:52.052 --> 41:56.181
So here I am recording

41:52.052 --> 41:56.181
this just for you.

41:56.223 --> 42:00.643
So, I am 11 weeks

41:56.223 --> 42:00.643
pregnant with you

42:00.685 --> 42:04.564
and I also have breast cancer.

42:04.606 --> 42:06.233
Just like my mom.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.238
But I want you to know

42:12.364 --> 42:19.204
that no matter what

42:12.364 --> 42:19.204
happens, I chose you.

42:19.246 --> 42:25.543
You are loved,

42:19.246 --> 42:25.543
and I will always,

42:25.585 --> 42:27.963
always be here with you.

42:29.631 --> 42:31.383
[Bernie] Tasha.

42:31.425 --> 42:34.177
That's your loud daddy.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.595
Yeah?

42:35.637 --> 42:36.554
Breakfast.

42:42.018 --> 42:43.437
What's all this?

42:45.439 --> 42:47.774
What do you mean,

42:45.439 --> 42:47.774
it's breakfast.

42:47.816 --> 42:50.777
Well, I can see that, it's

42:47.816 --> 42:50.777
just your idea of breakfast

42:50.819 --> 42:52.195
is usually cereal.

42:52.237 --> 42:53.238
Yeah, well.

42:55.449 --> 42:56.241
Not today.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.120
Bernie, don't do this.

43:01.663 --> 43:02.956
Do what?

43:02.998 --> 43:06.584
Start doing all this

43:02.998 --> 43:06.584
extra unnecessary stuff.

43:07.794 --> 43:09.587
It's just breakfast, Tasha.

43:09.629 --> 43:14.384
No, it's not, it's um...

43:09.629 --> 43:14.384
"You know I think you're

43:09.629 --> 43:14.384
gonna die soon,

43:14.426 --> 43:17.179
so let me start doing this

43:14.426 --> 43:17.179
extra stuff to compensate

43:17.220 --> 43:18.763
for what I should have

43:17.220 --> 43:18.763
been doing all along."

43:18.805 --> 43:20.765
That's not fair, Tasha.

43:20.807 --> 43:24.186
Okay? I made breakfast

43:20.807 --> 43:24.186
because I wanted to.

43:24.227 --> 43:25.603
So this is the

43:24.227 --> 43:25.603
part where we start

43:25.645 --> 43:26.771
talking about what's fair?

43:26.813 --> 43:27.981
No, you don't want to

43:26.813 --> 43:27.981
have that conversation

43:28.023 --> 43:29.399
with me right now, trust me.

43:29.441 --> 43:32.652
Oh, yes I do. I do want

43:29.441 --> 43:32.652
to have this conversation.

43:32.694 --> 43:34.571
All right, let's have

43:32.694 --> 43:34.571
the conversation.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.574
How are you gonna

43:34.612 --> 43:37.574
convince me or anybody else

43:37.615 --> 43:39.576
that you're being fair to

43:37.615 --> 43:39.576
yourself and your husband

43:39.617 --> 43:42.662
by keeping this baby instead

43:39.617 --> 43:42.662
of saving your own life?

43:42.704 --> 43:46.583
Hmm? Explain to me how

43:42.704 --> 43:46.583
that's fair. I'm listening.

43:46.624 --> 43:50.753
Bernie, this is not 25 years

43:46.624 --> 43:50.753
ago when my mother had cancer.

43:50.795 --> 43:53.590
There are new treatments

43:50.795 --> 43:53.590
and medicines...

43:53.631 --> 43:56.385
You are acting as if you're

43:53.631 --> 43:56.385
about to plan my funeral.

43:56.426 --> 43:58.595
I might have to.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.056
Do you understand that,

43:58.636 --> 44:01.056
Tasha? I just might have to.

44:01.097 --> 44:03.683
God, you don't think

44:01.097 --> 44:03.683
that I'm afraid of that?

44:03.725 --> 44:05.768
I am, God knows I wanna live.

44:05.810 --> 44:08.646
Then do what needs

44:05.810 --> 44:08.646
to be done, okay?

44:10.773 --> 44:12.775
[crying]

44:18.907 --> 44:19.908
God.

44:21.201 --> 44:26.206
You are so damn

44:21.201 --> 44:26.206
stubborn and naive.

44:27.749 --> 44:30.168
And what if I lose you, huh?

44:30.210 --> 44:31.169
Hmm? What then?

44:31.211 --> 44:32.421
What do I do?

44:36.425 --> 44:39.428
I've loved you my

44:36.425 --> 44:39.428
entire life, Tasha.

44:40.429 --> 44:43.557
Oh Bernie, I am so sorry.

44:44.600 --> 44:48.604
I am so--

44:44.600 --> 44:48.604
I am so sorry.

44:49.771 --> 44:52.148
[whispering] Ok, um...

44:52.190 --> 44:53.567
Look, you ready to go?

44:53.609 --> 44:55.944
Oh my God, my feet

44:53.609 --> 44:55.944
are killing me.

44:55.985 --> 44:57.571
You're walking around

44:55.985 --> 44:57.571
campus all day

44:57.613 --> 44:58.738
and then you come

44:57.613 --> 44:58.738
here work at night,

44:58.780 --> 45:00.490
I bet your feet do hurt.

45:02.075 --> 45:04.369
Don't expect no foot

45:02.075 --> 45:04.369
rub or nothing, though.

45:04.411 --> 45:05.954
Thanks for coming all

45:04.411 --> 45:05.954
this way to pick me up.

45:05.995 --> 45:10.917
It aint nothing, you know,

45:05.995 --> 45:10.917
that's what best friends

45:05.995 --> 45:10.917
are for, right?

45:10.959 --> 45:11.960
Yes.

45:12.419 --> 45:14.921
[Bernie] Why

45:12.419 --> 45:14.921
am I picking you up?

45:14.963 --> 45:16.756
Because I asked you to.

45:16.798 --> 45:19.759
I know that, your dad

45:16.798 --> 45:19.759
couldn't pick you up?

45:19.801 --> 45:22.929
-I'm trying to surprise him.

45:19.801 --> 45:22.929
-Aww.

45:22.971 --> 45:24.764
Ain't that sweet.

45:24.806 --> 45:25.932
Why are you coming home now?

45:25.974 --> 45:28.560
It's not a holiday or

45:25.974 --> 45:28.560
a break or anything.

45:28.602 --> 45:31.521
Tomorrow's the

45:28.602 --> 45:31.521
anniversary of Mom's death.

45:31.563 --> 45:33.773
[sighs]

45:33.815 --> 45:36.359
I don't like leaving

45:33.815 --> 45:36.359
him home alone you know?

45:36.401 --> 45:39.946
Yeah, I bet that.

45:36.401 --> 45:39.946
That's what's up.

45:39.988 --> 45:40.947
Don't act like you

45:39.988 --> 45:40.947
ain't gonna put no money

45:40.989 --> 45:42.782
in my gas tank, though.

45:42.824 --> 45:44.159
So what, you broke again?

45:44.200 --> 45:45.577
What?

45:45.619 --> 45:47.912
Girl, you got jokes.

45:45.619 --> 45:47.912
Nah, I ain't broke.

45:47.954 --> 45:49.122
I got a little

45:47.954 --> 45:49.122
something happening.

45:49.164 --> 45:50.748
Doing what?

45:50.790 --> 45:51.916
Don't look at me like that.

45:51.958 --> 45:54.586
I ain't doing nothing

45:51.958 --> 45:54.586
illegal, Tasha.

45:54.628 --> 45:55.545
Hey yo,

45:54.628 --> 45:55.545
for real, I'm not.

45:55.587 --> 45:57.547
[laughs]

45:57.589 --> 45:59.757
I got a job at this

45:57.589 --> 45:59.757
carpet company.

45:59.799 --> 46:02.218
Bernie, you the dude

45:59.799 --> 46:02.218
that can barely vacuum.

46:02.260 --> 46:05.930
Well, I guess that's something

46:02.260 --> 46:05.930
we got in common then.

46:05.972 --> 46:07.599
Well, good for you then.

46:09.392 --> 46:12.187
Take care of you

46:09.392 --> 46:12.187
too, if you let me.

46:14.814 --> 46:16.733
Okay, you see Bernie that's

46:14.814 --> 46:16.733
what I'm talking about.

46:16.816 --> 46:17.775
You play too much.

46:26.159 --> 46:28.953
Brenda, hey. It's been a while.

46:31.164 --> 46:33.791
Melvin, hi.

46:34.959 --> 46:38.129
Yeah, what five years at least.

46:38.171 --> 46:39.964
Six years to be exact.

46:41.591 --> 46:43.552
What are you doing here?

46:43.593 --> 46:44.844
Well, you know a

46:43.593 --> 46:44.844
little market like this

46:44.886 --> 46:46.137
is the best place to

46:44.886 --> 46:46.137
get a good steak.

46:46.179 --> 46:47.764
It's the best market in town.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.932
I was just picking up my

46:47.805 --> 46:49.932
seasonings for my jerk chicken.

46:49.974 --> 46:51.768
Ah, your jerk chicken, yeah.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.144
I remember that.

46:53.186 --> 46:54.896
So, how's Tasha?

46:54.937 --> 46:56.523
-She's in college now.

46:54.937 --> 46:56.523
-Wow.

46:56.565 --> 46:58.941
Yeah, actually I was

46:56.565 --> 46:58.941
hoping she'd come home

46:58.983 --> 47:01.819
in a few days, for you know...

47:02.779 --> 47:04.531
Uh, but she's busy studying.

47:04.573 --> 47:07.534
Tomorrow's the anniversary

47:04.573 --> 47:07.534
of Patricia's passing.

47:07.576 --> 47:09.911
Yeah. What's going on

47:07.576 --> 47:09.911
with you? You married?

47:09.952 --> 47:11.538
You not married? What?

47:11.580 --> 47:14.541
No, no, no. Been

47:11.580 --> 47:14.541
there done that.

47:14.583 --> 47:16.543
Yeah, I remember you having

47:14.583 --> 47:16.543
a hard time with your divorce.

47:16.585 --> 47:20.880
Oh, no not really. He

47:16.585 --> 47:20.880
was a lying, manipulative,

47:20.922 --> 47:24.926
narcissistic, weak example of

47:20.922 --> 47:24.926
a man. Easy to walk away from.

47:24.967 --> 47:26.762
Damn, tell me how

47:24.967 --> 47:26.762
you really feel.

47:26.803 --> 47:28.846
[chuckles]

47:30.139 --> 47:33.727
Well, listen, it was

47:30.139 --> 47:33.727
good to see you Melvin.

47:33.769 --> 47:36.896
Give Tasha my love and

47:33.769 --> 47:36.896
tell her I miss her.

47:36.938 --> 47:41.859
What about me? I mean, do

47:36.938 --> 47:41.859
you miss me even a little?

47:44.153 --> 47:47.532
You were such a constant

47:44.153 --> 47:47.532
in our lives for years,

47:47.574 --> 47:50.535
and these past years without

47:47.574 --> 47:50.535
you, I really regret it.

47:50.577 --> 47:54.330
If I could go back I

47:50.577 --> 47:54.330
would-- Well it's not important.

47:54.372 --> 47:56.124
I really miss you, Brenda.

47:56.165 --> 47:58.126
I'm not Patricia, Melvin.

47:58.167 --> 47:59.586
I know that.

48:01.630 --> 48:03.923
I was never trying

48:01.630 --> 48:03.923
to take her place.

48:03.965 --> 48:06.926
I was just trying to be there

48:03.965 --> 48:06.926
in whatever capacity I could.

48:06.968 --> 48:11.765
I realize that, and I took

48:06.968 --> 48:11.765
you for granted and I'm sorry.

48:12.557 --> 48:16.561
Yes, I do miss you.

48:18.354 --> 48:20.940
Well, what are you

48:18.354 --> 48:20.940
doing tonight?

48:20.982 --> 48:21.983
Are you busy?

48:22.024 --> 48:23.109
Would you like to have dinner?

48:23.151 --> 48:25.570
Remember, I cook a mean steak.

48:26.988 --> 48:32.952
Thank you, but um...

48:26.988 --> 48:32.952
I'm gonna pass on dinner.

48:32.994 --> 48:34.579
You take care of yourself, okay?

48:48.217 --> 48:49.135
Melvin.

48:51.346 --> 48:53.139
I like my steaks rare.

48:54.766 --> 48:55.933
Okay.

48:55.975 --> 48:56.768
Cabernet?

48:59.771 --> 49:00.730
Daddy!

49:02.023 --> 49:02.940
Daddy, I'm home!

49:07.028 --> 49:07.945
Daddy!

49:10.114 --> 49:10.948
Brenda?

49:12.116 --> 49:12.950
Oh!

49:16.037 --> 49:18.289
Oh my God, I can't believe this.

49:18.331 --> 49:20.082
And on the anniversary

49:18.331 --> 49:20.082
of my mother's death?

49:20.124 --> 49:22.001
That is totally disrespectful.

49:22.043 --> 49:24.921
Well, technically it's

49:22.043 --> 49:24.921
not on the anniversary.

49:24.962 --> 49:27.965
That's tomorrow, but I mean--

49:28.966 --> 49:31.720
To me, your dad and Brenda

49:28.966 --> 49:31.720
makes sense, you know?

49:31.761 --> 49:32.721
Really, Bernie?

49:32.762 --> 49:34.305
She was my mother's best friend.

49:34.347 --> 49:36.933
Yeah I know, but I mean...

49:36.974 --> 49:39.018
What do you mean?

49:36.974 --> 49:39.018
what do you mean?

49:39.060 --> 49:43.481
Look, it's not like he's

49:39.060 --> 49:43.481
cheating on your moms, you know?

49:43.523 --> 49:47.610
And Brenda, I mean, I'm just

49:43.523 --> 49:47.610
saying-- I'd hit it.

49:47.652 --> 49:48.486
[smacks]

49:48.528 --> 49:50.029
Ow, hey come on

49:48.528 --> 49:50.029
stop hitting on me.

49:50.071 --> 49:52.031
No, not when you

49:50.071 --> 49:52.031
say dumb crap like that.

49:52.073 --> 49:53.491
Come on Tasha, are you serious?

49:53.533 --> 49:55.493
What, you think your dad's

49:53.533 --> 49:55.493
gonna go the rest of his life

49:55.535 --> 49:57.036
without gettin' some?

49:57.078 --> 49:59.915
Come on man, you

49:57.078 --> 49:59.915
need to chill out.

49:59.956 --> 50:01.290
I don't need to do anything,

50:01.332 --> 50:03.919
but go back to school right now.

50:03.960 --> 50:06.504
No. no. Right now?

50:06.546 --> 50:07.881
-Yes.

50:06.546 --> 50:07.881
-No, no.

50:07.923 --> 50:09.090
We're not going back right

50:07.923 --> 50:09.090
now, we just got here.

50:09.131 --> 50:13.970
I'm not turning around and

50:09.131 --> 50:13.970
taking you all the way back.

50:14.303 --> 50:15.430
Fine.

50:18.099 --> 50:20.685
Can I spend the night

50:18.099 --> 50:20.685
at your house then?

50:20.727 --> 50:23.521
I really don't want

50:20.727 --> 50:23.521
to got home tonight.

50:25.106 --> 50:26.691
Are you finished yet?

50:26.733 --> 50:28.484
Bernie, I told you not to look.

50:28.526 --> 50:31.905
I'm not looking,

50:28.526 --> 50:31.905
all right? I'm just tired.

50:31.947 --> 50:33.072
You know, it took me four

50:31.947 --> 50:33.072
hours to come get you

50:33.114 --> 50:35.116
and four hours to come back.

50:41.122 --> 50:41.915
Okay, I'm done.

50:41.957 --> 50:42.749
Thank you.

50:52.508 --> 50:55.470
Bernie, what are you doing?

50:55.511 --> 50:58.514
I'm not sleeping

50:55.511 --> 50:58.514
in my clothes.

51:00.809 --> 51:02.184
Oh, man.

51:03.728 --> 51:06.272
No, no, no, no, no,

51:03.728 --> 51:06.272
you sleep on the floor

51:06.314 --> 51:07.899
and I'm gonna sleep in the bed.

51:07.941 --> 51:09.484
Tasha, I am not sleeping

51:07.941 --> 51:09.484
on the floor okay?

51:09.525 --> 51:12.194
I'm tired. I just wanna

51:09.525 --> 51:12.194
get in my own bed.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.280
Ain't nobody gonna

51:12.236 --> 51:14.280
touch you girl, move.

51:14.322 --> 51:16.115
But, what if your mom comes in?

51:16.157 --> 51:18.868
She's not coming in here.

51:16.157 --> 51:18.868
She works the night shift now.

51:25.291 --> 51:26.083
Bernie?

51:28.586 --> 51:30.005
Huh?

51:30.505 --> 51:33.132
How many girls

51:30.505 --> 51:33.132
have you been with?

51:33.174 --> 51:34.091
What?

51:36.594 --> 51:39.014
Tasha, you crazy girl,

51:36.594 --> 51:39.014
go to bed.

51:44.393 --> 51:46.395
Did you love any of them?

51:51.233 --> 51:52.027
No.

51:53.611 --> 51:56.113
So, you've never been in love?

51:57.198 --> 51:58.783
Well, yeah.

52:01.870 --> 52:02.871
With who?

52:07.583 --> 52:10.127
[gentle music]

52:13.798 --> 52:14.590
With you.

52:15.884 --> 52:18.177
[scoffs] Me?

52:18.219 --> 52:21.180
You can't be in love with me.

52:18.219 --> 52:21.180
I'm your best friend.

52:21.222 --> 52:23.850
That's more the reason, right?

52:33.026 --> 52:34.527
Make love to me, then.

52:34.569 --> 52:35.319
What?

52:35.361 --> 52:36.153
Nah.

52:37.238 --> 52:38.155
What do you mean, "nah"?

52:38.197 --> 52:39.741
No.

52:39.782 --> 52:42.201
What, is there

52:39.782 --> 52:42.201
something wrong with me?

52:42.243 --> 52:44.746
No, there's nothing

52:42.243 --> 52:44.746
wrong with you I'm just...

52:44.787 --> 52:46.789
Okay, well then why not?

52:56.382 --> 52:59.969
I'm not making love to

52:56.382 --> 52:59.969
you until I marry you, okay?

53:00.011 --> 53:01.178
Marry me?

53:04.181 --> 53:07.769
Bernie you are so stupid

53:04.181 --> 53:07.769
sometimes. Oh my gosh.

53:08.770 --> 53:09.562
Marry me.

53:11.773 --> 53:14.776
No, I'm not stupid, Tasha.

53:17.779 --> 53:19.781
I'm gonna marry you one day.

53:21.574 --> 53:22.575
I'm serious.

53:27.204 --> 53:30.332
But, for right now I'm gonna

53:27.204 --> 53:30.332
get some sleep. All right?

53:30.374 --> 53:31.208
Goodnight.

53:39.759 --> 53:41.260
Come on in and take a seat.

53:41.302 --> 53:43.304
We're just getting started.

53:43.345 --> 53:45.765
Okay. Thank you.

53:46.766 --> 53:48.143
I know we are

53:46.766 --> 53:48.143
all going through

53:48.184 --> 53:50.311
a lot of emotion right now.

53:50.352 --> 53:54.941
Ranging from fear

53:50.352 --> 53:54.941
to self pity to, well,

53:54.983 --> 53:57.526
feeling less than a woman.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.946
But your focus should

53:57.568 --> 53:59.946
not be on those things.

53:59.988 --> 54:03.032
Your focus should be

53:59.988 --> 54:03.032
sharing your information

54:03.074 --> 54:06.202
and your resources

54:03.074 --> 54:06.202
to help one another.

54:08.329 --> 54:10.498
Black women are more

54:08.329 --> 54:10.498
likely to be diagnosed

54:10.539 --> 54:13.501
with breast cancer, and

54:10.539 --> 54:13.501
have more aggressive forms

54:13.542 --> 54:16.504
of the disease than white women.

54:16.545 --> 54:20.133
Each of you have your own

54:16.545 --> 54:20.133
set of unique circumstances,

54:20.175 --> 54:22.927
but we are dealing with a

54:20.175 --> 54:22.927
disease that can be cured

54:22.969 --> 54:26.305
if monitored and

54:22.969 --> 54:26.305
treated properly.

54:26.347 --> 54:30.977
We need to give our breasts

54:26.347 --> 54:30.977
the attention they deserve.

54:32.561 --> 54:35.731
So, does anyone want to share?

54:35.773 --> 54:36.565
Anybody?

54:38.567 --> 54:40.319
Oh yeah, Denise.

54:40.361 --> 54:45.491
Well, I just had day 30 of

54:40.361 --> 54:45.491
my chemo, I'm almost done.

54:45.533 --> 54:47.702
[clapping]

54:47.743 --> 54:51.330
I know, what a wonderful thing.

54:51.372 --> 54:53.332
And I feel good today.

54:53.374 --> 54:54.667
I'm strong.

54:56.377 --> 54:59.338
I know I can beat this thing.

54:59.380 --> 55:02.008
How wonderful for you, Denise,

55:02.050 --> 55:03.509
but some of us don't

55:02.050 --> 55:03.509
have enough time left

55:03.551 --> 55:05.553
to think about next year.

55:06.762 --> 55:09.348
Let me just remind you

55:09.390 --> 55:12.351
that we were just at Jasmine's

55:09.390 --> 55:12.351
funeral last weekend.

55:12.393 --> 55:15.479
I mean, she was just sitting

55:12.393 --> 55:15.479
here with us, now she's gone.

55:15.521 --> 55:19.358
I haven't forgotten

55:15.521 --> 55:19.358
about Jasmine.

55:19.400 --> 55:23.112
Yeah, well, some of us are

55:19.400 --> 55:23.112
barely hanging on to hope.

55:23.154 --> 55:25.364
But y'all wanna post your

55:23.154 --> 55:25.364
little pictures on social media

55:25.406 --> 55:27.700
of your bald heads

55:25.406 --> 55:27.700
and your smiles,

55:27.742 --> 55:30.119
like this isn't killing women.

55:30.161 --> 55:32.496
Women do that to

55:30.161 --> 55:32.496
encourage one another;

55:32.538 --> 55:36.375
to let each other know

55:32.538 --> 55:36.375
they can get through this.

55:36.417 --> 55:38.502
I'm angry.

55:38.544 --> 55:39.962
I'm hurt.

55:41.422 --> 55:43.340
And I hate...

55:45.801 --> 55:49.305
that this

55:45.801 --> 55:49.305
is happening to me.

55:49.346 --> 55:53.101
My cancer is terminal.

55:53.142 --> 55:58.147
I have kids for God's sake.

55:58.522 --> 56:02.151
What are they gonna

55:58.522 --> 56:02.151
do without me?

56:04.820 --> 56:06.322
Tell me that?

56:06.363 --> 56:08.407
Look, I know that

56:06.363 --> 56:08.407
you are so angry--

56:08.449 --> 56:09.617
You're damn right I am.

56:09.658 --> 56:13.412
I wanna live!

56:13.454 --> 56:14.705
Oh, God, we all want that.

56:14.747 --> 56:18.167
I'm sorry, excuse

56:14.747 --> 56:18.167
me? What did you say?

56:20.211 --> 56:22.004
You wanna talk?

56:20.211 --> 56:22.004
Tell me your name.

56:24.924 --> 56:29.095
I'm Tasha Jackson and

56:24.924 --> 56:29.095
I was simply agreeing

56:29.137 --> 56:31.722
with the fact that

56:29.137 --> 56:31.722
we all want to live.

56:33.724 --> 56:37.478
Well, the great news is

56:33.724 --> 56:37.478
that I just found out

56:37.519 --> 56:41.440
that I'm pregnant

56:37.519 --> 56:41.440
with my first child.

56:41.482 --> 56:46.321
A baby that I have wanted and

56:41.482 --> 56:46.321
prayed for my entire life.

56:46.362 --> 56:49.782
A baby that, clinically

56:46.362 --> 56:49.782
speaking, I was never supposed

56:49.824 --> 56:53.828
to be able to conceive

56:49.824 --> 56:53.828
because I'm infertile. I was.

56:53.869 --> 56:58.082
On the flip side is the

56:53.869 --> 56:58.082
reason we are all here.

56:58.124 --> 57:01.794
I too have been diagnosed

56:58.124 --> 57:01.794
with breast cancer.

57:03.504 --> 57:07.466
My doctor has advised that

57:03.504 --> 57:07.466
I terminate my pregnancy

57:07.508 --> 57:11.637
in order to begin

57:07.508 --> 57:11.637
treatments immediately.

57:11.679 --> 57:14.307
But sacrificing my

57:11.679 --> 57:14.307
child's life in order

57:14.349 --> 57:18.936
to save mine is a decision

57:14.349 --> 57:18.936
that I simply cannot make.

57:20.104 --> 57:21.689
Adopt a baby.

57:21.730 --> 57:25.193
Terminate your pregnancy

57:21.730 --> 57:25.193
and save your life.

57:25.234 --> 57:27.486
Take it from someone who

57:25.234 --> 57:27.486
isn't gonna beat this thing.

57:27.528 --> 57:29.530
Charlene, please.

57:31.740 --> 57:36.495
Can you tell me, why

57:31.740 --> 57:36.495
is it so important

57:36.537 --> 57:39.957
that you would risk your

57:36.537 --> 57:39.957
own life for this baby?

57:42.835 --> 57:44.461
Do you have children?

57:44.503 --> 57:46.463
Yes, I have three.

57:48.549 --> 57:52.761
Would you risk your life

57:48.549 --> 57:52.761
in order to protect them?

57:52.803 --> 57:55.723
Would you die to save them?

57:55.764 --> 57:57.766
Of course I would.

57:58.559 --> 58:03.064
Even though my child

57:58.559 --> 58:03.064
is still inside of me,

58:03.105 --> 58:05.482
I feel that exact same way.

58:09.570 --> 58:11.572
Okay ladies, I'll

58:09.570 --> 58:11.572
see you next week.

58:17.578 --> 58:20.664
Uh, Tasha.

58:20.706 --> 58:23.459
This is Dr. Lopez's card.

58:26.670 --> 58:28.547
I know you think

58:26.670 --> 58:28.547
you're the only woman

58:28.589 --> 58:32.260
who has cancer while

58:28.589 --> 58:32.260
pregnant, but you're not.

58:32.301 --> 58:33.052
Go see him.

58:33.094 --> 58:35.679
[dramatic music]

58:37.598 --> 58:39.558
[Tasha]<i> I was told that you</i>

58:37.598 --> 58:39.558
<i>could help me Dr. Lopez.</i>

58:40.601 --> 58:43.604
There has to be another option.

58:43.645 --> 58:45.564
Now, I have received all

58:43.645 --> 58:45.564
of your medical records

58:45.606 --> 58:47.608
that were transferred

58:45.606 --> 58:47.608
to my office,

58:47.649 --> 58:49.818
and I cannot say that

58:47.649 --> 58:49.818
terminating your pregnancy

58:49.860 --> 58:54.490
at this juncture was the wrong

58:49.860 --> 58:54.490
advice from your oncologist.

58:55.116 --> 58:58.827
In fact, it's normal practice

58:55.116 --> 58:58.827
to suggest termination

58:58.869 --> 59:01.914
in the first trimester when

58:58.869 --> 59:01.914
there's cancer present.

59:01.956 --> 59:05.626
You need treatment Mrs.

59:01.956 --> 59:05.626
Jackson, you need it now.

59:05.667 --> 59:08.421
You have an aggressive

59:05.667 --> 59:08.421
form of breast cancer.

59:08.463 --> 59:10.589
Hormones that your body's

59:08.463 --> 59:10.589
producing during your pregnancy

59:10.631 --> 59:15.470
will only cause the tumor

59:10.631 --> 59:15.470
to grow and possibly spread.

59:15.844 --> 59:18.597
You cannot afford to wait.

59:18.639 --> 59:23.602
What I can't afford

59:18.639 --> 59:23.602
is to abort my baby.

59:23.644 --> 59:25.020
Then I will do

59:23.644 --> 59:25.020
everything in my power

59:25.062 --> 59:29.442
to keep your baby safe

59:25.062 --> 59:29.442
while you receive treatment.

59:29.484 --> 59:31.402
You will?

59:31.444 --> 59:32.236
I will.

59:33.654 --> 59:35.614
But this will be

59:33.654 --> 59:35.614
a long hard road,

59:35.656 --> 59:38.242
nothing about this will be easy.

59:40.661 --> 59:42.579
What do we need to do?

59:42.621 --> 59:46.167
Well, the first step is a

59:42.621 --> 59:46.167
mastectomy of the left breast

59:46.208 --> 59:49.586
with a partial

59:46.208 --> 59:49.586
reconstruction, immediately.

59:51.213 --> 59:52.631
I understand your concerns.

59:52.673 --> 59:55.968
Surgery is always a

59:52.673 --> 59:55.968
risk, pregnant or not.

59:56.010 --> 59:59.596
And the closer the

59:56.010 --> 59:59.596
surgery is to the uterus,

59:59.638 --> 1:00:03.600
we run the risk of a

59:59.638 --> 1:00:03.600
spontaneous abortion.

1:00:03.642 --> 1:00:07.396
However, I feel certain that

1:00:03.642 --> 1:00:07.396
we can preform the surgery

1:00:07.438 --> 1:00:09.231
and keep the baby safe.

1:00:10.232 --> 1:00:11.984
So that's it?

1:00:12.026 --> 1:00:14.153
We do the surgery now,

1:00:12.026 --> 1:00:14.153
while I'm pregnant,

1:00:14.195 --> 1:00:15.612
and the chemo after?

1:00:16.989 --> 1:00:18.157
You will be receiving chemo

1:00:18.199 --> 1:00:20.159
during your pregnancy

1:00:18.199 --> 1:00:20.159
Mrs. Jackson.

1:00:20.201 --> 1:00:21.743
What?

1:00:21.785 --> 1:00:24.663
How on earth is that possible?

1:00:24.705 --> 1:00:27.958
Dr. Lopez, I saw first hand what

1:00:24.705 --> 1:00:27.958
that chemo did to my mother

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.586
and it sucked the

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.586
life out of her.

1:00:30.627 --> 1:00:32.171
How could I go through

1:00:30.627 --> 1:00:32.171
something like that

1:00:32.213 --> 1:00:35.757
while I'm pregnant? How

1:00:32.213 --> 1:00:35.757
could my baby survive that?

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:38.760
While there are certain

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:38.760
types of chemo that would harm

1:00:38.802 --> 1:00:42.681
the baby, there are other

1:00:38.802 --> 1:00:42.681
types that will be harmless,

1:00:42.723 --> 1:00:45.767
spread out over a period of

1:00:42.723 --> 1:00:45.767
every three weeks for six

1:00:42.723 --> 1:00:45.767
months,

1:00:45.809 --> 1:00:47.728
and I will connect

1:00:45.809 --> 1:00:47.728
with your obstetrician.

1:00:47.769 --> 1:00:51.648
We will monitor both you

1:00:47.769 --> 1:00:51.648
and the baby very closely.

1:00:53.401 --> 1:00:56.404

1:00:53.401 --> 1:00:56.404

1:01:02.868 --> 1:01:06.747

1:01:06.788 --> 1:01:09.708
So what you're

1:01:06.788 --> 1:01:09.708

1:01:09.750 --> 1:01:15.214
I could go through all of

1:01:09.750 --> 1:01:15.214

1:01:17.007 --> 1:01:18.717

1:01:18.759 --> 1:01:21.345

1:01:21.387 --> 1:01:24.139
Even as doctors we cannot

1:01:21.387 --> 1:01:24.139
ignore the possibility

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:30.605
that your husband would raise

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:30.605
this child, your child, alone.

1:02:54.813 --> 1:02:55.772
So, you went to the

1:02:55.814 --> 1:02:56.691
Yes.

1:02:59.776 --> 1:03:01.820

1:03:07.868 --> 1:03:10.538

1:03:10.579 --> 1:03:14.124
and begin treatment for

But in addition to the chemo,

I also have to have a surgery.

1:09:00.178 --> 1:09:01.262
-[clapping]

1:09:01.304 --> 1:09:04.058
Look at these booty shorts.

1:09:04.099 --> 1:09:05.183
Baby booty--

1:09:04.099 --> 1:09:05.183
Come on man.

1:09:05.225 --> 1:09:07.185
Look at this!

1:09:05.225 --> 1:09:07.185
The little-- Who did this one?

1:09:07.227 --> 1:09:10.313
Oh my God, that

1:09:07.227 --> 1:09:10.313
is so beautiful.

1:09:10.355 --> 1:09:12.691
Oh. Precious. Isn't

1:09:10.355 --> 1:09:12.691
that sweet, Carol?

1:09:12.733 --> 1:09:14.234
It's so precious.

1:09:14.275 --> 1:09:17.195
Oh, we're not gonna have

1:09:14.275 --> 1:09:17.195
to buy clothes for years.

1:09:17.237 --> 1:09:18.864
Thank you so much.

1:09:22.993 --> 1:09:24.953
A diaper bag.

1:09:24.995 --> 1:09:26.204
[Brenda] You can use that.

1:09:26.246 --> 1:09:28.749
Oh, let's see if I

1:09:26.246 --> 1:09:28.749
can put it on now.

1:09:28.790 --> 1:09:30.166
[cheering]

1:09:30.208 --> 1:09:32.961
[Brenda] Oh, look at that.

1:09:30.208 --> 1:09:32.961
That is so great.

1:09:33.003 --> 1:09:35.756
[clapping]

1:09:35.797 --> 1:09:37.049
[Brenda] Nice.

1:09:38.466 --> 1:09:41.803
Oh, get up off the floor.

1:09:38.466 --> 1:09:41.803
What is wrong with you?

1:09:41.845 --> 1:09:45.807
Would you get up off the floor?

1:09:41.845 --> 1:09:45.807
You are out of your mind.

1:09:45.849 --> 1:09:48.226
Get up off the floor, would you?

1:09:48.268 --> 1:09:50.020
You are in the way.

1:09:50.062 --> 1:09:51.813
Daddy gets every shot--

1:09:50.062 --> 1:09:51.813
Oh, here we go again.

1:09:51.855 --> 1:09:54.232
Here we are again bro.

1:09:51.855 --> 1:09:54.232
Melvin.

1:09:54.274 --> 1:09:55.817
Here we go. Look.

1:09:55.859 --> 1:09:58.236
[laughs]

1:09:58.278 --> 1:10:01.865
Today, I am 33 weeks pregnant,

1:10:02.282 --> 1:10:05.243
and we also had

1:10:02.282 --> 1:10:05.243
your baby shower.

1:10:07.287 --> 1:10:11.249
The biggest news, is that

1:10:07.287 --> 1:10:11.249
you are gonna be here

1:10:11.291 --> 1:10:14.210
in about, oh just

1:10:11.291 --> 1:10:14.210
a few short weeks.

1:10:15.295 --> 1:10:18.006
Oh honey, see the

1:10:15.295 --> 1:10:18.006
doctor's gonna perform

1:10:18.048 --> 1:10:20.258
what they call a C-section.

1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:22.803
And that means he's gonna

1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:22.803
cut you outta mommy's tummy.

1:10:22.844 --> 1:10:24.805
Now, I know that may sound gross

1:10:24.846 --> 1:10:26.807
and it may be too

1:10:24.846 --> 1:10:26.807
much information,

1:10:26.848 --> 1:10:30.602
but the point is that you

1:10:26.848 --> 1:10:30.602
are going to be here soon

1:10:30.644 --> 1:10:32.813
and safe.

1:10:32.854 --> 1:10:37.025
Keep on doing what you're

1:10:32.854 --> 1:10:37.025
doing girl, you are so strong.

1:10:37.067 --> 1:10:41.237
And promise me that you're

1:10:37.067 --> 1:10:41.237
always gonna be that way.

1:10:43.949 --> 1:10:45.283
Oof!

1:10:45.325 --> 1:10:49.079
My goodness, time

1:10:45.325 --> 1:10:49.079
for a potty break.

1:10:49.121 --> 1:10:51.081
Mommy can't keep going like this

1:10:51.123 --> 1:10:54.250
with a three pound

1:10:51.123 --> 1:10:54.250
Patricia on her bladder.

1:10:56.503 --> 1:10:57.462
All right.

1:10:57.504 --> 1:10:58.463
[groaning]

1:10:58.505 --> 1:11:01.758
How do I get out of this chair?

1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:04.260
Okay, here goes.

1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:07.472
[splashing]

1:11:09.349 --> 1:11:11.476
Oh my God.

1:11:11.518 --> 1:11:15.522
Bernie? I think my

1:11:11.518 --> 1:11:15.522
water just broke!

1:11:23.363 --> 1:11:24.865
The baby's here.

1:11:24.906 --> 1:11:26.950
She and Tasha are

1:11:24.906 --> 1:11:26.950
doing just fine.

1:11:26.992 --> 1:11:28.326
[laughing]

1:11:28.368 --> 1:11:30.328
Congratulations, Daddy.

1:11:30.370 --> 1:11:32.914
Ah, thank you. Oh, my God.

1:11:34.499 --> 1:11:38.670
She's uh... She's a

1:11:34.499 --> 1:11:38.670
little small, but they say

1:11:34.499 --> 1:11:38.670
she's doing good.

1:11:38.712 --> 1:11:39.671
Amazing.

1:11:39.713 --> 1:11:41.089
-Yeah.

1:11:39.713 --> 1:11:41.089
-And how's my baby girl?

1:11:41.131 --> 1:11:43.675
She was a champ bro.

1:11:41.131 --> 1:11:43.675
Melvin, she was a champ.

1:11:43.717 --> 1:11:44.885
Oh, that's my baby.

1:11:44.926 --> 1:11:46.678
Thank God. Thank God.

1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:48.471
I cannot believe this.

1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:48.471
I'm a papa.

1:11:48.513 --> 1:11:49.472
Yes, you are.

1:11:49.514 --> 1:11:52.517
And uh...

1:11:49.514 --> 1:11:52.517
you're a proud grandpapa.

1:11:54.394 --> 1:11:56.437
Yeah, uh, okay. I guess I am.

1:11:56.479 --> 1:11:58.648
[laughing]

1:11:58.690 --> 1:12:01.526
Congratulations.

1:12:01.985 --> 1:12:03.987
Baby, you did so good.

1:12:05.113 --> 1:12:08.283
Oh yes, we just saw

1:12:05.113 --> 1:12:08.283
the baby in NICU.

1:12:08.324 --> 1:12:10.660
Daddy, could you stop?

1:12:08.324 --> 1:12:10.660
I look a mess.

1:12:10.702 --> 1:12:12.079
What you talking about?

1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:14.873
You look great, I

1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:14.873
mean considering.

1:12:16.917 --> 1:12:19.920
Tasha's a mommy. You did it.

1:12:21.504 --> 1:12:22.672
I did, didn't I?

1:12:22.714 --> 1:12:24.465
Yes, you did, baby.

1:12:24.507 --> 1:12:26.426
She's healthy and wonderful.

1:12:26.467 --> 1:12:28.428
Yeah, she is.

1:12:28.469 --> 1:12:30.264
Knock knock. [chuckles]

1:12:30.305 --> 1:12:32.057
[Tasha] Oh, Dr. Lopez.

1:12:32.099 --> 1:12:33.433
Your OB called my office

1:12:33.474 --> 1:12:35.643
and let me know you

1:12:33.474 --> 1:12:35.643
delivered the baby last night

1:12:35.685 --> 1:12:37.437
and everything went well.

1:12:37.478 --> 1:12:39.273
Thank you.

1:12:39.314 --> 1:12:41.399
No thanks needed. I'm just

1:12:39.314 --> 1:12:41.399
glad she arrived safely.

1:12:41.441 --> 1:12:42.776
Yes.

1:12:42.817 --> 1:12:43.651
[Lopez] A little earlier

1:12:42.817 --> 1:12:43.651
than we would have liked.

1:12:43.693 --> 1:12:44.652
[laughing]

1:12:44.694 --> 1:12:45.445
A little early.

1:12:45.486 --> 1:12:46.863
What about Tasha?

1:12:46.905 --> 1:12:49.074
Well, she has two

1:12:46.905 --> 1:12:49.074
more chemo sessions.

1:12:49.116 --> 1:12:51.659
And then we'll get the

1:12:49.116 --> 1:12:51.659
MRI, see if she's cleared.

1:12:51.701 --> 1:12:53.494
Could we not talk

1:12:51.701 --> 1:12:53.494
about that right now

1:12:53.536 --> 1:12:55.538
and focus on celebrating?

1:12:55.580 --> 1:12:59.417
Well, you do that and

1:12:55.580 --> 1:12:59.417
I will see you later.

1:12:59.459 --> 1:13:00.418
Everybody take care. Huh?

1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:02.129
-Thank you.

1:13:03.463 --> 1:13:04.923
Well, I don't know about ya'll,

1:13:04.965 --> 1:13:07.717
but I can't wait to

1:13:04.965 --> 1:13:07.717
get that baby home.

1:13:07.759 --> 1:13:09.136
Now listen, you don't have

1:13:07.759 --> 1:13:09.136
to worry about a thing.

1:13:09.177 --> 1:13:10.929
I'm gonna come over. I'm

1:13:09.177 --> 1:13:10.929
gonna sleep on the couch.

1:13:10.971 --> 1:13:13.932
I'm gonna fix the formula.

1:13:10.971 --> 1:13:13.932
I'm gonna change the diapers.

1:13:13.974 --> 1:13:16.434
I'm gonna get up in the middle

1:13:13.974 --> 1:13:16.434
of the night with the baby.

1:13:16.476 --> 1:13:17.435
I know Bernie don't know nothing

1:13:17.477 --> 1:13:18.728
about taking care of no baby.

1:13:18.770 --> 1:13:20.355
[laughs]

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:22.941
I was praying

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:22.941
you would say that.

1:13:22.983 --> 1:13:26.153
I don't know what we would

1:13:22.983 --> 1:13:26.153
do without you, Brenda.

1:13:26.194 --> 1:13:29.447
I don't think Bernie knows

1:13:26.194 --> 1:13:29.447
how to change a diaper.

1:13:29.489 --> 1:13:30.531
I don't think so either.

1:13:30.573 --> 1:13:32.700
[giggles]

1:13:32.742 --> 1:13:35.162
[gentle music]

1:13:36.537 --> 1:13:38.039
[Bernie]<i> Look who's here.</i>

1:13:38.539 --> 1:13:40.334
[Tasha] Oh, honey.

1:13:40.375 --> 1:13:42.502
[Bernie] I know, I know.

1:13:42.543 --> 1:13:44.338
Oh my God, would you

1:13:42.543 --> 1:13:44.338
look at that girl?

1:13:44.379 --> 1:13:45.505
Look at this big old baby.

1:13:45.546 --> 1:13:47.341
Oh.

1:13:47.382 --> 1:13:49.550
-Hey, little mama.

1:13:47.382 --> 1:13:49.550
-Oh.

1:13:49.592 --> 1:13:51.219
-Come here.

1:13:49.592 --> 1:13:51.219
-How precious is she?

1:13:51.261 --> 1:13:52.512
Come here, what

1:13:51.261 --> 1:13:52.512
you smiling at?

1:13:52.553 --> 1:13:55.515
-Hi.

1:13:52.553 --> 1:13:55.515
-Huh, what you smiling at?

1:13:55.556 --> 1:13:56.933
Come on.

1:13:56.975 --> 1:13:59.102
-[crying]

1:13:56.975 --> 1:13:59.102
-I know, I know, I know.

1:13:59.144 --> 1:14:01.188
-It's okay.

1:13:59.144 --> 1:14:01.188
-Come to Mama.

1:14:01.604 --> 1:14:04.732
It's okay.

1:14:04.774 --> 1:14:06.526
Patricia, it's fine.

1:14:06.567 --> 1:14:07.485
It's all right, baby.

1:14:07.527 --> 1:14:08.486
Don't cry, honey.

1:14:08.528 --> 1:14:09.487
Here you go.

1:14:09.529 --> 1:14:10.488
It's okay.

1:14:10.530 --> 1:14:12.157
-Here you go.

1:14:10.530 --> 1:14:12.157
-There you go.

1:14:14.368 --> 1:14:16.494
That's what that girl wanted.

1:14:16.536 --> 1:14:18.538
Good job, Daddy.

1:14:19.747 --> 1:14:21.916
And Mommy can't wait

1:14:19.747 --> 1:14:21.916
to get up from here

1:14:21.958 --> 1:14:23.918
and take care of you herself.

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:25.503
Mommy needs to

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:25.503
give it some time.

1:14:25.545 --> 1:14:26.504
I know.

1:14:26.546 --> 1:14:27.922
All right, don't over do it.

1:14:27.964 --> 1:14:29.132
You just finished your

1:14:27.964 --> 1:14:29.132
last chemo session,

1:14:29.174 --> 1:14:30.717
and you need your energy

1:14:30.758 --> 1:14:32.927
to celebrate this

1:14:30.758 --> 1:14:32.927
little lady coming home.

1:14:32.969 --> 1:14:34.512
Hey, baby.

1:14:34.554 --> 1:14:35.471
Oh, wow.

1:14:36.556 --> 1:14:37.557
Honey, could you

1:14:36.556 --> 1:14:37.557
please take her?

1:14:37.598 --> 1:14:38.516
Hm?

1:14:38.558 --> 1:14:40.101
Take her I can't.

1:14:40.143 --> 1:14:43.521
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:14:40.143 --> 1:14:43.521
I got you. I got you.

1:14:43.563 --> 1:14:48.026
When are, um, Daddy and Brenda

1:14:43.563 --> 1:14:48.026
supposed to get here?

1:14:48.860 --> 1:14:50.237
Um, they said they should

1:14:48.860 --> 1:14:50.237
be here within the hour.

1:14:50.278 --> 1:14:51.238
[crying]

1:14:51.279 --> 1:14:52.406
Okay.

1:14:53.489 --> 1:14:56.534
Did you make that last

1:14:53.489 --> 1:14:56.534
bottle before you left?

1:14:56.576 --> 1:14:58.036
I'm doing it right now.

1:14:58.078 --> 1:15:00.705
Baby, are you sure you

1:14:58.078 --> 1:15:00.705
got it? 'Cause I don't...

1:15:00.747 --> 1:15:02.916
Yeah, sure, yeah.

1:15:02.957 --> 1:15:04.542
You don't sound too convincing.

1:15:04.584 --> 1:15:05.752
I got it.

1:15:07.087 --> 1:15:11.299

1:15:07.087 --> 1:15:11.299

1:15:12.842 --> 1:15:15.262
Okay, okay, Mommy's coming.

1:15:17.138 --> 1:15:19.515
Mommy's coming, baby.

1:15:17.138 --> 1:15:19.515
Don't cry, honey.

1:15:20.558 --> 1:15:21.351
Okay.

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.521
Just give Mommy some time, okay?

1:15:25.563 --> 1:15:27.107
Mommy time.

1:15:27.148 --> 1:15:30.318
Oh, Patricia don't cry, baby.

1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:31.527
Okay?

1:15:58.472 --> 1:16:00.265
she's extremely anemic.

1:16:01.641 --> 1:16:03.310

1:16:36.050 --> 1:16:40.638

1:16:36.050 --> 1:16:40.638

She was my bestest friend

1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:44.642

1:16:44.684 --> 1:16:46.811

1:16:44.684 --> 1:16:46.811
to the neighborhood,

1:16:46.853 --> 1:16:49.814
and I didn't have one friend.

1:16:49.856 --> 1:16:51.649
For weeks I sat up on my porch

1:16:51.691 --> 1:16:54.986
and watched her playing

1:16:51.691 --> 1:16:54.986

1:16:55.028 --> 1:16:56.988
Finally one day, she

1:16:55.028 --> 1:16:56.988
marched over to me

1:16:57.030 --> 1:17:00.200
and said, "What's

1:16:57.030 --> 1:17:00.200
wrong with you?

Until the day she passed.

1:17:31.689 --> 1:17:37.695
a mastectomy, chemo,

1:17:37.737 --> 1:17:41.074

1:17:37.737 --> 1:17:41.074
safely, all for what?

1:17:41.115 --> 1:17:43.743
So she can get laid up in a
