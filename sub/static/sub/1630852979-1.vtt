I'm going already, okay?
- I don't care!

01:21.650 --> 01:22.658
You're not going out.
- No!

01:22.658 --> 01:24.137
- You are grounded.
- No, I'm going.

01:24.137 --> 01:25.110
- Tylar!
- You can't stop me.

01:25.110 --> 01:27.100
- Stop!
(Tylar groans)

01:27.100 --> 01:28.832

01:28.832 --> 01:30.219
- Tylar!
(lamp smashing)

01:30.219 --> 01:33.750
You are still grounded and
you are going to stay grounded

01:33.750 --> 01:37.223
until you find a way to fix
the things you've broken!

01:39.680 --> 01:43.443

02:00.683 --> 02:03.784
(dogs barking)

02:03.784 --> 02:06.320
What do you think, Mom? Should I call CPS?

02:06.320 --> 02:07.770
Seems like child abuse to me.

02:09.171 --> 02:11.599
(dramatic music)

02:11.599 --> 02:12.432
- Tylar.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.454
- Stay out of it, Val.

02:14.454 --> 02:15.287
- Tylar.

02:15.287 --> 02:17.190
- We have to do something.

02:17.190 --> 02:18.440

02:19.483 --> 02:20.316

02:20.316 --> 02:21.730

02:23.290 --> 02:24.123
Honey, come on.

02:24.123 --> 02:24.956
- No.

02:24.956 --> 02:25.910
- Hey, what the fuck, man?

02:25.910 --> 02:26.987

02:26.987 --> 02:28.100
Drive. Drive!
- Get out of the car.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.190
- Go. Go.

02:39.568 --> 02:40.401

02:41.947 --> 02:42.800

02:44.926 --> 02:46.426

- Hi.

02:47.921 --> 02:50.150
- So you escaped from Auschwitz, huh, Ty?

02:50.150 --> 02:52.720
- No prison walls can hold this, babe.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.680
Yes, please, please, please, please.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.370
- Graham, do you think you could give me

02:56.370 --> 02:57.550
a ride to campus manana?

02:57.550 --> 02:59.180
My block cracked.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.230
- You got that right?

03:01.425 --> 03:03.068
- Totally. Hit me, bro.

03:03.068 --> 03:04.651
- That looks good.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.857
- You're loitering
unless you buy somethin'.

03:18.310 --> 03:20.610
- [Tylar] I was just about to order.

03:20.610 --> 03:22.523
- Your parents know you're out this late?

03:27.110 --> 03:29.233
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

03:32.166 --> 03:35.400

03:35.400 --> 03:38.083
- Geez, guys, he's just

03:39.900 --> 03:42.270
This is my lover from another mother.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.717

04:05.950 --> 04:09.076
Where'd you get Boston from?

04:09.076 --> 04:09.909
You from there?

04:13.550 --> 04:15.983
- No. It's personal.

04:20.590 --> 04:22.563
Maybe I'll tell you if I know you better.

04:39.850 --> 04:42.130
- [Boston] No, this is Squishy's bro.

04:42.130 --> 04:42.963
- [Joanne] Her bro?

04:42.963 --> 04:43.850
- Squishy can't come
to the phone right now

04:43.850 --> 04:47.736
'cause she's in the shower
with her best friend Tylar.

04:47.736 --> 04:48.569
- [Joanne] What do you
mean she's in the shower?

04:48.569 --> 04:50.433

04:50.433 --> 04:51.516

04:51.516 --> 04:52.349
Excuse me.

And actually, you know what?

04:53.182 --> 04:56.628
I gotta go 'cause they want
me in there with them, so.

04:56.628 --> 04:58.429
- [Joanne] Put Tylar
on the phone right now!

04:58.429 --> 05:00.210
- I'm sorry, bye.
(group giggling)

05:00.210 --> 05:02.483
- That's harsh, man. She's worried.

05:04.090 --> 05:06.463
- So we're having a threesome?

05:08.663 --> 05:11.193
You and me and your sister?

05:15.210 --> 05:17.038
- Yeah, I didn't think that part through.

05:17.038 --> 05:18.523
(group laughs)

05:18.523 --> 05:19.356
- No shit.

05:19.356 --> 05:20.730
- Can we get outta here?

05:20.730 --> 05:23.130
I have the need for some weed.

05:23.130 --> 05:24.900
- My crib. My dad's outta town.

05:24.900 --> 05:25.847
- As per uzh.

05:27.259 --> 05:28.794
- [Squishy] Let's go, then.

05:28.794 --> 05:30.750
Yeah, go. What are we waiting for?

05:30.750 --> 05:32.610
- [Tylar] Come on! Let's go.

05:32.610 --> 05:34.760
- Ty, your phone.

05:34.760 --> 05:38.003
- Hurry up.
(group chattering)

05:43.840 --> 05:44.989
- [Val] Maybe she's in the shower.

05:44.989 --> 05:46.490
- No.

05:46.490 --> 05:48.611
Squishy doesn't have a brother.

05:48.611 --> 05:49.920
Tylar's messing with me.

05:49.920 --> 05:54.033
I don't even know Squishy's
real name, or where she lives.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.247
- What do you wanna do?

05:58.153 --> 06:00.736
(Joanne sighs)

06:01.730 --> 06:04.940
(group giggling)

06:04.940 --> 06:07.890
- So how long is your dad outta town?

06:07.890 --> 06:11.123
- Trick question. When is he ever in town?

06:13.390 --> 06:15.330
- At least you got a dad.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.230
My mom won't even tell me who mine is.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.620
- Well, in the absence of a father figure,

06:21.610 --> 06:24.703
it's incumbent upon
you to invent your own.

06:25.921 --> 06:27.363
- (giggles) Incumbent?

06:28.220 --> 06:30.615
- Community college smart guy talk.

06:30.615 --> 06:32.068
(group giggles)

06:32.068 --> 06:33.620
- Okay, okay, okay.

06:33.620 --> 06:37.910
Well, my dad is

06:42.090 --> 06:47.090
the El Chapo of the
biggest, baddest cartel

06:47.090 --> 06:48.883
in North America.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.635
He has bodies everywhere.

06:51.635 --> 06:53.027
(group giggling)
- What?

06:53.027 --> 06:54.654
- Everywhere.

06:54.654 --> 06:59.654
And he took on the DEA
and the FBI and the CIA

07:02.230 --> 07:04.773
and the ATF.
- The KGB.

07:05.826 --> 07:06.983
- (laughs) And the KGB,

07:08.166 --> 07:13.166
and a bunch of other letters,
and he won and they lost.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.527
But then he met my mom,

07:17.527 --> 07:20.020
and he knocked her up, and he realized

07:20.020 --> 07:23.543
she was the bitch-meister
from hell, so he bailed.

07:25.130 --> 07:27.033
- 'Cause she's a DEA agent.

07:27.970 --> 07:28.893
- County engineer.

07:30.130 --> 07:32.023
But we can go with that.

07:33.750 --> 07:34.583
- Ease up.

07:34.583 --> 07:37.560
Your mom'll get pissed if
you show up super stoned.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.002
- Okay, Grandpa Graham.

07:39.002 --> 07:41.888
(group giggles)

07:41.888 --> 07:44.320
Why don't we just stay here
and keep the party going?

07:44.320 --> 07:45.237
- For real.

07:48.430 --> 07:50.369
- You're staying, right?

07:50.369 --> 07:51.202
- Mm-hmm.

07:53.489 --> 07:56.156
(gentle music)

08:06.263 --> 08:07.863
- [Joanne] Just watch your step.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.770
- I know you don't wanna hear this,

08:13.770 --> 08:15.463
but it's tough love time.

08:17.470 --> 08:19.140
- She'll show up. She always does.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.700
- And what then?

08:20.700 --> 08:23.713
What happens when things
escalate like they already are?

08:25.970 --> 08:28.880
- I don't even know what
happened, it just...

08:32.063 --> 08:33.157
Am I a terrible mother?

08:33.157 --> 08:34.793
- You're a great mom.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.100
I just think it's time
you laid down the law.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.550
If I were you, I would change the locks.

08:42.550 --> 08:43.440
Take back control.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.040
- She'll run away again!

08:46.040 --> 08:47.800
- What is the alternative?

08:47.800 --> 08:50.353
That one of you ends up
in the hospital or worse?

08:51.552 --> 08:55.946
- (sighs) Thank you for helping.

08:55.946 --> 08:58.270
You should go. I don't
want Devon to be mad at me.

08:58.270 --> 08:59.103
- Tough love.

10:34.370 --> 10:37.423
- Hey, I'll buzz you in. Door's open.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.183
- Hey, girl.

10:58.183 --> 10:59.016
- Hey.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.000
- Want some coffee?
- Thank you.

11:02.000 --> 11:02.833
- Yep.

11:07.095 --> 11:07.928
Here ya go.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.430
- You haven't slept?

11:09.430 --> 11:12.620
- No, no. She stayed out all night.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.070
She's never done that before.

11:15.928 --> 11:18.428
(door clicks)

11:25.910 --> 11:27.160
- I'm really sorry, Mom.

11:29.034 --> 11:33.271
I'm so sorry. (sobbing)

11:33.271 --> 11:35.604
- Oh, okay, okay. It's okay.

11:37.031 --> 11:39.103
It's okay. All right?

11:44.010 --> 11:45.143
- Sorry. Hi, Val.

11:47.619 --> 11:48.452
- Hi.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.406
- You gotta wash this
glitter off your face.

11:52.406 --> 11:53.239
- I know.

11:55.580 --> 11:59.590
I should probably get ready
for school. (sniffles)

12:11.570 --> 12:12.403
- What?

12:14.840 --> 12:15.980
- That's an act.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.920
But as a credit card fraud investigator,

12:17.920 --> 12:20.883
I read people and their
motives and she is playing you.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.183
- Maybe.

12:25.253 --> 12:28.253
- (sighs) Oh honey.

12:31.534 --> 12:33.350
You know her passcode?

12:33.350 --> 12:34.183
- Why?

12:36.210 --> 12:37.043
Why?

12:37.043 --> 12:38.060
- Because we're gonna
download a tracking app

12:38.060 --> 12:39.620
and the next time she
pulls a stent like this,

12:39.620 --> 12:41.080
we're gonna drag her ass back here-

12:41.080 --> 12:42.110
- Stop it.

12:42.110 --> 12:44.433
Absolutely not. Put it back.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.233
Please, put it back. Val.

12:50.090 --> 12:53.443
If she found out about
that, it would be over.

12:55.010 --> 12:57.063
Please, put it back.

12:58.730 --> 12:59.563
- Okay.

13:01.100 --> 13:04.040
But when you're ready, and you will be,

13:04.040 --> 13:05.290

14:37.240 --> 14:39.600
You're always on my ass about my grades.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.210
How come the minute I
actually find someone

14:41.210 --> 14:43.530
to help me bring them up,
you gotta crap all over it?

14:43.530 --> 14:46.747
- Okay, I'm just asking
where you met, Tylar.

14:48.666 --> 14:51.670
He's obviously four or five
years older than you, right?

14:51.670 --> 14:52.523
In his 20s?

14:54.304 --> 14:56.300
Is there something going
on between the two of you?

14:56.300 --> 14:57.493
- God, Mom, no.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.120
Boston's just a friend.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.430
He goes to Folsom and he
wants to be a math teacher.

15:03.430 --> 15:06.103
- Sorry, Folsom Community College?

15:07.590 --> 15:09.353
- He offered to help. That's it.

15:11.270 --> 15:13.587
Besides, I'm pretty sure he's gay, so.

15:15.220 --> 15:16.163
- As a daffodil.

15:17.930 --> 15:20.590
But I get if it's weird.

15:20.590 --> 15:22.840
I can totally bounce if
you want me to leave.

15:26.454 --> 15:28.260
- No, it's okay. You can stay.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.160
- Only if I can help.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.460
I like cooking for people.

15:32.410 --> 15:33.600
- Okay, sure.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.393
- Okay, cool. I'm gonna wash up.

15:37.350 --> 15:38.433
- It's that way.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.150
Okay, let me understand this here.

15:46.150 --> 15:49.090
This guy shows up out of nowhere

15:49.090 --> 15:52.763
and apparently wants to tutor
you in math for no reason.

15:54.540 --> 15:59.010
Ty, this is a little too
good to be true, honey.

15:59.010 --> 15:59.983
I'm not stupid.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.363
- I swear, he's just a cool guy.

16:04.620 --> 16:07.120
His dad's never really
home, so I think he's just,

16:07.120 --> 16:09.043
I don't know, lonely or something.

16:11.149 --> 16:13.570
Hey, seriously?

16:13.570 --> 16:15.330
You were gonna change the locks?

16:15.330 --> 16:16.163
You were gonna lock me out?

16:16.163 --> 16:18.343
- No, Tylar.
- No, mine.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.043
Don't.

16:23.217 --> 16:25.367
- Tylar, things have
to change around here.

16:27.850 --> 16:31.413
- I know. And they will, I promise.

16:32.770 --> 16:34.223
- I make a mean rigatoni.

16:39.963 --> 16:41.713
Just gonna grab that.

16:49.764 --> 16:52.847
(soft ominous music)

17:28.705 --> 17:31.205
(tense music)

17:41.850 --> 17:43.260
- You know, he offered to help renovate

17:43.260 --> 17:45.573
the rooms upstairs so I can rent them out?

17:48.350 --> 17:50.470
- And he's offering out of
the goodness of his heart?

17:50.470 --> 17:53.940
- Well yeah. I offered
to pay, but he refused.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.570
I think he's just really
desperate for company.

17:56.570 --> 17:58.053
I feel really bad for him.

17:59.149 --> 18:01.200
- I thought you said he
was in a relationship.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.420
- He is, but you know, it's rocky.

18:03.420 --> 18:05.320
It's off and on.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.390
- Hmm, so that's why he likes it here

18:07.390 --> 18:11.171
because he has yours and
Tylar's shoulders to cry on.

18:11.171 --> 18:15.090
- Val, he doesn't have
a good home life, okay?

18:15.090 --> 18:17.000
His dad's never around.
He travels all the time.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.473
- Well, what about his mom?

18:19.330 --> 18:20.680
- He's never mentioned her.

18:22.410 --> 18:25.940
Look, all I know is that
her grades in math are up.

18:25.940 --> 18:27.323
All of her grades are up.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.460
She's different when he's around.

18:30.460 --> 18:33.710
She smiles. We haven't fought.

18:33.710 --> 18:35.830
He's a good influence.

18:35.830 --> 18:38.323
He calls her his little
sister. It's adorable.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.360
- Look, I gotta go.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.780
I've got brunch with Devon's family.

18:45.780 --> 18:46.613
- Oh.

18:46.613 --> 18:47.446
- Shoot me now.

18:47.446 --> 18:48.570
- Oh yeah.

18:48.570 --> 18:50.040
- I'll see myself out.

18:50.040 --> 18:50.873
- Okay.

18:59.910 --> 19:03.480
Whoa. You were right.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.431
I love this color. It's perfect.

19:05.431 --> 19:06.264
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:06.264 --> 19:07.670
- It's lively, but it's neutral enough

19:07.670 --> 19:08.880
for whoever wants to rent the room.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.273
- Lively and neutral.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.470
I like that.

19:13.470 --> 19:15.490
Well, I just wanted to tell
you that I really appreciate

19:15.490 --> 19:19.570
all your help around here,
not just in the room.

19:19.570 --> 19:20.403
- It's cool.

19:20.403 --> 19:21.623
I liked hanging with you and Ty.

19:21.623 --> 19:24.300
- What do you mean "liked"?

19:24.300 --> 19:25.710
I hope you don't think I'm just using you

19:25.710 --> 19:27.650
to fix the room up.

19:27.650 --> 19:32.060
I really, we really
like having you around.

19:32.060 --> 19:32.893
Yeah.

19:32.893 --> 19:34.703
- No, that's awesome, and thank you.

19:36.070 --> 19:39.440
The thing is, my dad sold the house,

19:39.440 --> 19:40.820
so I'm moving outta state.

19:40.820 --> 19:42.450
- Really?

19:42.450 --> 19:44.112
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.

19:44.112 --> 19:45.700
- Yeah, it sucks.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.810
I mean, I'm used to switching schools

19:47.810 --> 19:48.643
in the middle of the term,

19:48.643 --> 19:52.040
but I feel like I finally
made good friends here.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.313
- What about your boyfriend. God, is it?

19:58.150 --> 19:58.983
Well, you're in college now.

19:58.983 --> 20:01.110
I mean, you can get your own place, right?

20:01.110 --> 20:02.230
- I'm not a baller, J.

20:02.230 --> 20:05.070
I mean, even if I could get
more hours at La Cantina

20:05.070 --> 20:07.093
there's no way I could
afford rent around here.

20:09.570 --> 20:10.403
- Yeah.

20:23.330 --> 20:25.540
Hey, how about this?

20:25.540 --> 20:27.690
I gotta rent this room to someone.

20:27.690 --> 20:28.740
- [Boston] Yeah, but I can't afford it.

20:28.740 --> 20:31.650
- I know, but you know
what you can't afford

20:31.650 --> 20:34.580
to pay me in rent you can
make up as a handyman.

20:34.580 --> 20:35.850
You're really helpful, Boston,

20:35.850 --> 20:38.760
and the room next door
needs to be renovated.

20:38.760 --> 20:39.670
- You serious?

20:39.670 --> 20:41.300
- Yeah. (chuckles)

20:41.300 --> 20:42.133
- I don't know.

20:43.020 --> 20:45.050
I mean, I don't want it to be weird.

20:45.050 --> 20:45.883
- [Joanne] What do you mean?

20:45.883 --> 20:48.856
- Like, what if I wanna have God over?

20:48.856 --> 20:51.760
And how would Ty feel about
having me around 24-7?

20:53.010 --> 20:55.260
- I think she would love
to have you next door

20:55.260 --> 20:56.910
as opposed to across the country.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.870
- Mind if I think about it?

21:00.870 --> 21:03.327
- Okay. Yeah.

21:03.327 --> 21:04.170
- Awesome.

21:04.170 --> 21:05.003
- Awesome.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.270
- I'm a complete mess.
I'm gonna go wash up.

21:09.270 --> 21:10.563
- Okay. Yeah.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.850
- She full-on begged me to move in.

21:30.850 --> 21:33.440
- Oh my God. It totally worked.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.787
- Wait, but she's right down the hall.

21:46.787 --> 21:47.640
- So?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.533
- It's too risky.
- No, come on.

21:51.000 --> 21:51.900
Don't you want to?

21:56.042 --> 21:58.459
(Ty giggles)

22:50.487 --> 22:52.433
Stay and party.

22:52.433 --> 22:54.993
- I can't. I gotta make
scratch for my lady.

22:57.317 --> 22:58.150
- Fine.

22:59.917 --> 23:02.810
But, I don't know, since
this is the last night

23:02.810 --> 23:04.990
at your old crib, shouldn't we give it

23:04.990 --> 23:08.423
a proper sendoff, you
know, in honor of your dad.

23:09.267 --> 23:12.017
(dramatic music)

23:15.367 --> 23:17.240
- [Squishy] A fire extinguisher?

23:17.240 --> 23:19.329
- Look out.
(Tylar laughs)

23:19.329 --> 23:20.324
- [Boston] Okay, okay.

23:20.324 --> 23:23.818
(extinguisher hissing)
(group laughing)

23:23.818 --> 23:28.401
(dramatic music)
- What are you doing?

23:30.413 --> 23:31.246
- [Tylar] Who's next?

23:31.246 --> 23:33.663
- [Squishy] Well, okay then.

23:35.576 --> 23:37.395
- Yeah, babe. Oh!

23:37.395 --> 23:40.145
(dramatic music)

23:49.906 --> 23:52.656
(dramatic music)

23:57.465 --> 24:00.298
(mirror breaking)

24:01.850 --> 24:03.860
- Whoa, whoa, Ty. What are you?

24:03.860 --> 24:05.694
Ty, Ty, stop, stop.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.439
Stop, stop, stop.

24:07.439 --> 24:11.106
(dramatic music continues)

24:32.330 --> 24:33.580
- Is there anything special

24:33.580 --> 24:35.230
we can make for your friends, Ty?

24:36.710 --> 24:38.010
- Well, it's Memorial Day.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.895
So, hot dogs and chips?

24:40.895 --> 24:42.069
- Okay.

24:42.069 --> 24:44.200
- Unless you wanna make it a kegger.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.490
- Ha ha.

24:45.490 --> 24:46.723
- Yeah, didn't think so.

24:49.587 --> 24:53.020
(Joanne chuckles)

24:53.020 --> 24:57.225
- What about you, Boston,
you wanna bring anybody? God?

24:57.225 --> 24:59.963
- You know, I wasn't going
to, but if you'd be down.

25:01.010 --> 25:03.010
- Yeah, of course. The more the merrier.

25:04.405 --> 25:06.860
(corn husk squeaks)

25:06.860 --> 25:09.860
Sweetheart, you're leaving an
awful lot of silk on those.

25:09.860 --> 25:12.110
You just have to, yeah, I can...

25:13.870 --> 25:14.820
- [Tylar] Whatever.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.850
- She's a good kid.

25:19.850 --> 25:21.850
Just like teenage hormones or somethin'.

25:27.210 --> 25:29.390
- What happened to her hand?

25:29.390 --> 25:31.440
- She said she broke a glass doing dishes.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.640
- Yeah, that's what she told me, too.

25:33.640 --> 25:36.170
And I would believe that if I
could buy Tylar doing dishes,

25:36.170 --> 25:37.003
which I don't.

25:45.673 --> 25:46.673
Is she okay?

25:50.300 --> 25:52.350
Would you tell me if something was wrong?

25:55.380 --> 25:57.920
- Yeah. Yeah, I would.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.630
But I mostly just work and go to school.

26:00.630 --> 26:02.350
I don't really have time to hang,

26:02.350 --> 26:03.850
except of course to tutor her.

26:08.860 --> 26:09.693
Let me help.

26:13.350 --> 26:14.183
I got it.

26:16.480 --> 26:21.423
Oh, smells good. Really good.

26:24.468 --> 26:26.620
I take it you've done this before.

26:26.620 --> 26:27.453
- Yeah.

26:29.745 --> 26:32.245
(tense music)

27:00.867 --> 27:03.071
- Ty, what the hell are you doin'?

27:03.071 --> 27:04.501
- Um, you.

27:04.501 --> 27:07.010
- No, this is way risky.

27:07.010 --> 27:09.603
If your mom sees us in
here, she'll throw me out.

27:12.580 --> 27:13.493
- Got any X?

27:15.940 --> 27:17.590
Come on, where's your bag of fun?

27:18.665 --> 27:21.665
(mellow rock music)

28:03.520 --> 28:05.653
Have you ever been in love before?

28:08.269 --> 28:10.147
- [Boston] No.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.533
- [Tylar] Think this
is what it feels like?

28:16.198 --> 28:17.031
- Yeah.

28:20.745 --> 28:21.828
I think I do.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.547
I love you.

28:25.547 --> 28:27.533
- [Tylar] I want it to be like this.

28:29.290 --> 28:32.003
I want us to be like this forever.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.597
(both panting)

28:42.030 --> 28:43.480
- [Boston] Who's stopping us?

28:44.340 --> 28:45.840
- [Tylar] Have you met my mom?

28:47.340 --> 28:49.600
- [Boston] She's not that bad.

28:49.600 --> 28:54.030
I mean, maybe if we just tell her.

28:54.030 --> 28:55.833
- She wouldn't understand.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.620
- Has it always been like this?

29:07.236 --> 29:10.144
- We've had some good times.

29:10.144 --> 29:13.523
(chuckles) My 10th birthday.

29:14.580 --> 29:18.180
She surprised me, took me out to dinner

29:18.180 --> 29:22.377
to this castle restaurant
way up on a hill.

29:23.626 --> 29:25.209
- That's beautiful.

29:26.310 --> 29:28.463
- It was. Totally.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.330
I felt like a princess.

29:36.330 --> 29:38.733
I just couldn't believe
she did all that for me.

29:42.288 --> 29:43.488
But it was just one day.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.560
- Some day, I'm gonna buy
you a castle on a hill

29:54.610 --> 29:57.110
and I'm gonna treat you
like a princess every day.

29:58.740 --> 29:59.573
- I love you.

30:04.349 --> 30:06.933
- I love you.

30:06.933 --> 30:09.933
(sultry rock music)

30:26.289 --> 30:29.194
- (laughing) Come on, do it now.

30:29.194 --> 30:31.340
(group chattering)

30:31.340 --> 30:33.570
- [Val] So that's God? Boston's boyfriend?

30:33.570 --> 30:35.030
- [Joanne] Yeah, I guess
they're back together.

30:35.030 --> 30:36.610
- And allegedly this is the first time

30:36.610 --> 30:39.080
that Boston's meeting Tylar's friends.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.691
- Allegedly? What, are we on trial here?

30:41.691 --> 30:44.470
- (chuckles) Oh, the
courtroom of Val Paladino

30:44.470 --> 30:46.377
is always in session, trust me.

30:47.354 --> 30:51.279
- I'm sorry, I just, I
don't trust that kid.

30:51.279 --> 30:53.130
There's somethin' about him.

30:53.130 --> 30:56.090
(group chattering)

30:56.090 --> 30:58.200
I just hope you didn't
pull the trigger too fast.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.400
You know, moving the
fox into the hen house.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.890
- [Devon] Come on, guys,
today's Memorial Day.

31:05.890 --> 31:07.828
Why don't we toast to my Uncle Beau

31:07.828 --> 31:09.872
and to the others who fought for us, huh?

31:09.872 --> 31:10.705
Come on.

31:10.705 --> 31:12.928
- Yes!
(group chattering)

31:12.928 --> 31:14.200
- All right, ready?

31:14.200 --> 31:15.654
- No hard feelings.

31:15.654 --> 31:18.821
(dramatic rock music)

31:24.848 --> 31:28.350
- So this thing with Boston,
it's like an actual thing?

31:28.350 --> 31:31.313
I mean, he's like old and gay.

31:32.210 --> 31:35.203
- He's bi and I thought
you were my friend.

31:36.170 --> 31:38.014
- I am it's just...

31:38.014 --> 31:41.181
(dramatic rock music)

31:59.840 --> 32:04.020
But, I know you don't mean to, it's just,

32:04.020 --> 32:05.913
I think you're messing
with his head a little bit.

32:06.790 --> 32:10.053
So what, you think I should
be with someone my own age?

32:10.980 --> 32:11.820
Got someone in mind?

32:11.820 --> 32:13.543
- No, come on, Ty. Not cool.

32:14.687 --> 32:17.854
(dramatic rock music)

32:30.420 --> 32:31.520
- What's up with that?

32:33.200 --> 32:34.720
- I didn't wanna say anything,

32:34.720 --> 32:37.573
but he got a little handsy in the pool.

32:38.475 --> 32:41.642
(dramatic rock music)

32:53.410 --> 32:56.040
No, it's okay. I told him what's what.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.580
(Boston sighs)

33:07.580 --> 33:10.747
(dramatic rock music)

33:35.519 --> 33:37.060
What are you doing?

33:37.060 --> 33:38.360
- Just using the restroom.

33:40.970 --> 33:41.803
- Right.

33:42.760 --> 33:43.740
- Took someone's credit card

33:43.740 --> 33:47.193
and bought $5,000 worth
of luggage in Paris.

33:48.066 --> 33:50.500
Ah, so this is the new project.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.720
- Yeah.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.450
We're gonna add some doors, paint,

33:54.450 --> 33:57.020
and Boston thinks it'll
be ready in about a month.

33:57.020 --> 33:58.148
- That's exciting.

33:58.148 --> 33:59.231
- I think so.

34:09.803 --> 34:12.802
Tylar's always leaving
her bags everywhere.

34:12.802 --> 34:15.552
(car doors thud)

34:16.520 --> 34:18.650
- [Tylar] Okay, but do
we really have to study?

34:18.650 --> 34:21.560
- No, but then you'll
fail your test tomorrow.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.866
I've invested way too much
into you to let that happen.

34:24.866 --> 34:26.033
- Oh, whatevs.

34:33.760 --> 34:34.960
Mom, what is all this stuff?

34:34.960 --> 34:36.450
- You tell me.

34:36.450 --> 34:38.295
- That's not mine!

34:38.295 --> 34:39.128
- Tylar.

34:40.990 --> 34:41.823
Tylar.

34:41.823 --> 34:44.423
Get back here now!

34:47.360 --> 34:48.193
- Hmm?

34:52.080 --> 34:54.850
Anything else you wanna accuse me of, Mom?

34:54.850 --> 34:56.130
- [Boston] It's mine.

34:56.130 --> 34:56.963
- [Joanne] What?

34:56.963 --> 34:58.890
- I mean, it's God's, but
I let him keep it here.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.620
I would never hurt you or Ty.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.480
- I want you to get outta my house.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.530
- No. No, Mom, you can't do that.

35:04.530 --> 35:05.537
- Yes I can and I will.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.760
- No, if you throw him
out, then I'm leaving, too.

35:07.760 --> 35:08.593
- It's okay, Ty.

35:08.593 --> 35:09.700
- What, do you want me to call CPS?

35:09.700 --> 35:11.400
Huh? Is that what you really want?

35:12.770 --> 35:13.913
- Just go, please.

35:17.690 --> 35:18.523
Sweetheart.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.000
You swear to me those drugs aren't yours?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.613
- Why don't you ever just believe me!

35:27.780 --> 35:29.550
- Stay away from his room!

35:29.550 --> 35:30.383
(Tylar screams)

35:30.383 --> 35:33.003
- What? Joanne, you
can't let him stay here.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.403
- I'll lose her again.

35:39.210 --> 35:40.460
- What do you mean again?

35:43.437 --> 35:46.020
(Joanne sighs)

35:55.003 --> 35:57.057
- When Tylar was a kid, uh,

35:59.320 --> 36:01.753
it was a really stressful time for me.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.443
I was working full-time,

36:06.620 --> 36:11.173
not making enough money
and raising her by myself.

36:15.013 --> 36:17.337
Tylar was a difficult child.

36:26.460 --> 36:30.493
One day I was driving her to
daycare and she was screaming,

36:31.470 --> 36:34.750
just mouthing off, out of control,

36:34.750 --> 36:37.163
just screaming and screaming.

36:38.940 --> 36:40.850
She wouldn't stop.

36:40.850 --> 36:45.730
And I just snapped.

36:45.730 --> 36:50.730
I turned around and I just,
I hit her really hard.

36:56.856 --> 36:58.456
I left my handprint on her face.

37:05.730 --> 37:09.853
And her teacher saw it and called CPS.

37:12.936 --> 37:15.553
And they took her away for six months.

37:17.324 --> 37:20.491
(soft ominous music)

37:22.423 --> 37:23.783
I thought I was going to die.

37:27.986 --> 37:29.553
And when I got her back,

37:29.553 --> 37:31.910
they told me if they ever
suspected abuse again

37:31.910 --> 37:32.900
I would lose her.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.383
- So that's why you're
afraid to discipline her now.

37:39.309 --> 37:40.809
- I'm so ashamed.

37:41.710 --> 37:43.710
Oh God, I'm so ashamed.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.723
It's my fault.

37:52.096 --> 37:53.263
It's my fault.

38:02.807 --> 38:04.730
- [Boston] No, Tylar. Seriously.

38:04.730 --> 38:06.730
- [Tylar] I missed you.

38:06.730 --> 38:09.543
- No, stop. Get out.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.976
Get out.

38:11.976 --> 38:16.976
- Mm-mm.

38:18.190 --> 38:19.163
- Ty, stop.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.423
- I thought you loved me.

38:22.620 --> 38:26.737
- You know I do, but your mom
seriously hates me right now.

38:26.737 --> 38:29.020
- Oh my God, you actually
care what she thinks?

38:29.020 --> 38:30.570
- I care about staying with you

38:30.570 --> 38:33.020
and that's not gonna happen
if she throws me out.

38:34.090 --> 38:36.673
Stop! What's wrong with you?

38:38.440 --> 38:39.720
- You sound like her.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.570
- You know that's not how I meant it.

38:44.214 --> 38:45.564
- I just wanna be with you.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.420
Can't you call in sick to work tomorrow?

38:50.420 --> 38:51.410
I'll skip school.

38:51.410 --> 38:54.230
- No, Ty. You're not gonna do that.

38:54.230 --> 38:55.983
Okay, and I gotta make scratch.

38:57.300 --> 38:58.500
- Well, I'm not leaving.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.930
- Mom.
- Ty.

39:01.930 --> 39:04.993
Okay, okay. Okay, chill.

39:06.410 --> 39:07.243
Okay.

39:10.690 --> 39:12.130
- Tell me you love me.

39:12.130 --> 39:13.247
- You know I do.

39:14.837 --> 39:15.867
Now get out.

39:44.350 --> 39:45.430
- Right.

39:45.430 --> 39:47.890
Well, I'm recommending that
we close the Bridges case.

39:47.890 --> 39:49.990
It looks like a legitimate account hack.

39:49.990 --> 39:52.040
I still have some legwork to do on Fehte.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.053
Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

39:56.790 --> 39:59.973
- Okay, Mrs. Kravitz,
stick to credit card fraud.

40:01.490 --> 40:03.210
- It's a school day and Joanne's at work

40:03.210 --> 40:04.960
and they're having pizza delivered.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.400
You tell me what's going on.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.020
- Let's see.

40:10.020 --> 40:13.670
Boston's working on the
renovations and he got hungry.

40:13.670 --> 40:16.997
Ooh, another case solved. God, I'm good.

40:23.063 --> 40:25.813
(music thumping)

40:30.558 --> 40:34.017
(buttons beeping)

40:34.017 --> 40:36.684

40:55.209 --> 40:57.014
(music thumping)

40:57.014 --> 40:58.627
(knuckles tapping)

40:58.627 --> 40:59.720
- Boston!

40:59.720 --> 41:02.470
(music thumping)

41:17.473 --> 41:18.431
Boston?

41:18.431 --> 41:21.431
(upbeat rock music)

41:25.088 --> 41:27.921
(couple groaning)

41:32.957 --> 41:35.845
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:35.845 --> 41:36.678
Whoa!

41:36.678 --> 41:37.511
- Oh my God.

41:37.511 --> 41:38.344
- What the hell?

41:38.344 --> 41:39.220
- I am so sorry, Boston.

41:39.220 --> 41:40.430
I heard the music.

41:40.430 --> 41:41.880
- We broke up, I swear.

41:41.880 --> 41:42.713
- Sorry.
- But you're not gonna

41:42.713 --> 41:43.900
tell J, are you?

41:43.900 --> 41:44.733
Hey, wait!

41:46.040 --> 41:47.760
I said wait.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.670
You're not gonna tell J
about God and me, right?

41:49.670 --> 41:50.503
- I have to.

41:51.540 --> 41:53.620
- Maybe I'll get to her first.

41:53.620 --> 41:54.707
Tell her how you busted in here,

41:54.707 --> 41:57.260
came into my room to see me naked.

41:57.260 --> 41:59.975
- Come on, she knows me better than that.

41:59.975 --> 42:02.550
(door slams)

42:02.550 --> 42:03.897
- It ain't a lie, right?

42:06.567 --> 42:09.490
Maybe I didn't know what else to do,

42:09.490 --> 42:12.420
so I let you take advantage of me, huh?

42:13.840 --> 42:18.433
Oh wait, plot twist, I'm gay, right?

42:20.180 --> 42:21.633
Oh, just too bad.

42:23.100 --> 42:26.053
'Cause I've always wanted
to fuck an older bitch.

42:27.070 --> 42:28.570
You feel me?

42:28.570 --> 42:29.833
Feel me? That's right.

42:30.821 --> 42:31.904
That's right.

42:33.210 --> 42:34.083
That's what's up.

I'm the guy that you used to hook up with.

43:23.310 --> 43:24.143
Peace out.

43:28.211 --> 43:29.223

43:29.223 --> 43:30.056
- Right?

43:38.110 --> 43:40.960
We should just take off somewhere.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.150
Go somewhere no one could find us

43:43.150 --> 43:46.039
and we could be together all the time.

43:46.039 --> 43:47.023
- How would we live?

43:47.950 --> 43:52.270
- We could go to L.A. and be porn stars.

43:52.270 --> 43:54.780
- You're underage. I think they'd notice.

43:54.780 --> 43:58.358
- Okay, well, you could do it then.

43:58.358 --> 44:00.558
And I wouldn't care.
It's just a job, right?

44:01.960 --> 44:03.600
You could do gay stuff.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.763
It pays better.

44:05.665 --> 44:08.533
- I would never cheat on
you, not even for money.

44:11.503 --> 44:14.283

44:16.520 --> 44:18.160
Your ass is mine.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.003
Do you think I'd ever let you sell it?

44:22.350 --> 44:23.600
- I love you, Tylar Witt,

44:24.950 --> 44:27.610
and I'll do whatever I have
to to keep us together.

44:54.970 --> 44:56.020

44:59.090 --> 45:00.290

45:02.060 --> 45:02.910

45:16.256 --> 45:18.160

45:18.160 --> 45:19.563
- He's not gay, Joanne.

45:20.740 --> 45:23.713
Or he's, what are they calling
it now? Sexually fluid.

45:25.900 --> 45:27.313
- Why are you saying this?

45:28.170 --> 45:29.220
- Think about it, Joanne.

45:29.220 --> 45:31.110
A guy shows up out of
nowhere and wants to spend

45:31.110 --> 45:33.540
all of his time with
your underage daughter.

45:33.540 --> 45:36.520
And then the next thing
you know he's moving in?

45:36.520 --> 45:37.930
- That was my idea.

45:37.930 --> 45:38.763
- Was it?

45:40.100 --> 45:42.920
Because now you have drugs and
condoms all over your house

45:42.920 --> 45:46.180
and he has an easy excuse
to explain them away.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.607
that my daughter's been
absent from school today?

46:15.607 --> 46:17.090
- [Office Attendant] Name, please.

46:17.090 --> 46:19.710
- Sorry, Tylar Witt.

46:19.710 --> 46:21.400
- [Office Attendant] Yes. All week.

46:21.400 --> 46:22.363
- All week?

46:23.210 --> 46:24.937
Why is this the first
time I'm hearing of this?

46:24.937 --> 46:27.387
- [Office Attendant] We've
sent multiple notices.

46:28.760 --> 46:31.143
- Okay. Thank you. (sighs)

46:40.894 --> 46:41.727
Tylar?

46:45.033 --> 46:46.342
Tylar!

46:46.342 --> 46:49.879
(music thumping)
(phone ringing)

46:49.879 --> 46:52.349
- [Tylar] I'm not here.
Leave a message, or don't.

46:52.349 --> 46:53.182
- Tylar!

46:58.507 --> 47:00.040
(knuckles tapping)

47:00.040 --> 47:01.690
Boston, open the door. Now!

47:03.295 --> 47:04.593
- (yawns) What's up, J?

47:05.758 --> 47:07.670
- [Joanne] Tylar!

47:07.670 --> 47:09.690
- [Boston] Why would Tylar be in here?

47:09.690 --> 47:11.283
She'd be at school, right?

47:13.380 --> 47:16.390
- You have two fucking seconds
to tell me where she is.

47:16.390 --> 47:17.775
- I swear I don't know.

47:17.775 --> 47:20.942
(dramatic rock music)

47:28.490 --> 47:29.650
- You son of a bitch!

47:29.650 --> 47:30.776
She's just a kid!

47:30.776 --> 47:32.100
- It's not like that, J!

47:32.100 --> 47:33.270
Ty's not a kid anymore.

47:33.270 --> 47:34.900
We love each other!

47:34.900 --> 47:36.030
- You what?

47:36.030 --> 47:36.863
You fucking what?

47:36.863 --> 47:38.954
You love her?
- Mom, no, stop!

47:38.954 --> 47:40.482
- You fucking love her?
- Stop! Stop!

47:40.482 --> 47:42.177
You crazy bitch, stop it!
- Get the fuck outta here!

47:42.177 --> 47:44.236
- No, Boston, don't, don't.

47:44.236 --> 47:45.327
- Let go of me.

47:45.327 --> 47:46.681
- Tylar!
- Let go! Let go!

47:46.681 --> 47:48.139
(both shouting)

47:48.139 --> 47:49.099
- Go in the house!

47:49.099 --> 47:50.082
(Tylar spits)

47:50.082 --> 47:50.915
- [Devon] Don't!

47:50.915 --> 47:52.443
- Do it, do it. Hit me!

47:52.443 --> 47:54.080
Hit me. Hit me, Mom.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.833
- Go back inside, now!

47:57.940 --> 47:59.315
Go!
(Tylar panting)

47:59.315 --> 48:01.360
(tires screeching)

48:01.360 --> 48:03.380
- They fuckin' played me. Oh God.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.213
- Joanne!

48:06.903 --> 48:09.237
- (sobbing) Please.

48:09.237 --> 48:10.299
- You on the phone?

48:10.299 --> 48:11.460
Give me the phone.
- Mom, no!

48:11.460 --> 48:13.920
No, please. He doesn't
have anywhere to go.

48:13.920 --> 48:14.753
Where is he gonna go?

48:14.753 --> 48:17.820
- He's going to prison, Tylar. To prison.

48:17.820 --> 48:18.653
- [Tylar] No. (sobbing)

48:18.653 --> 48:20.780
- Listen to me. This is
what's gonna happen now.

48:20.780 --> 48:22.071
This is mine.

48:22.071 --> 48:22.904
- No!

48:22.904 --> 48:23.940
- I will take you to school,

48:23.940 --> 48:25.430
I will pick you up from school.

48:25.430 --> 48:27.940
You will come here and
you will go nowhere else

48:27.940 --> 48:30.523
until I decide you are ready to leave.

48:31.490 --> 48:33.139
Keep crying, Tylar.

48:33.139 --> 48:34.543
- No. (sobbing)
- I don't give a shit.

48:36.201 --> 48:38.999
(Tylar sobbing)

48:38.999 --> 48:40.749
- [Tylar] I hate you!

48:42.323 --> 48:44.080
- I want that tracking app.

48:44.080 --> 48:45.880
I wanna monitor her calls, her texts,

48:45.880 --> 48:47.313
social media, everything.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.930
I wanna press charges.

48:51.930 --> 48:53.850
This is statutory rape, right?

48:53.850 --> 48:54.683
- Yes.

48:54.683 --> 48:57.002
And you should file charges,

48:57.002 --> 48:59.350
but it's gonna be difficult to prove

48:59.350 --> 49:02.430
unless you could somehow
get Tylar to testify.

49:02.430 --> 49:04.743
- I'll get proof. Trust me.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.273
Thanks.

49:14.206 --> 49:17.373
(students chattering)

49:28.690 --> 49:30.140
- [Tylar] Hey, Squishy. Ready?

49:30.140 --> 49:31.890
- [Squishy] I was born ready, babe.

49:39.437 --> 49:42.104
(upbeat music)

49:43.440 --> 49:45.540
- I had to borrow money for a new uniform.

49:47.140 --> 49:49.090
- Where'd you sleep last night?

49:49.090 --> 49:52.550
- My car 'cause none of our
friends would let me crash.

49:52.550 --> 49:54.150
- Yeah, that's 'cause they suck.

49:59.290 --> 50:00.210
- You don't think your mom's actually

50:00.210 --> 50:01.610
gonna press charges, do you?

50:04.550 --> 50:05.710
I gotta bounce.

50:05.710 --> 50:06.543
- What? No.

50:06.543 --> 50:08.090
You can't bail on me.

50:08.090 --> 50:09.513
- I'm not bailing on you.

50:10.486 --> 50:12.440
Look, come with me, Ty.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.990
Let's just get the hell outta here.

50:14.990 --> 50:16.360
We can work on getting you the castle.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.950
- No, that'll just put you

50:17.950 --> 50:20.350
one Amber alert closer to a life sentence.

50:20.350 --> 50:21.250
- Okay, what then?

50:24.200 --> 50:27.683
- Lay low. They can't prove anything.

50:28.870 --> 50:30.260
It's her word against ours,

50:30.260 --> 50:32.580
and what do you think, I'd
throw you under the bus?

50:32.580 --> 50:35.937
- So I can't stay here,
and I got nowhere to go.

50:35.937 --> 50:38.180
- And you're saying it's my fault, right?

50:38.180 --> 50:39.157
That's what you're saying, right?

50:39.157 --> 50:40.020
- Hey chill, chill.

50:40.020 --> 50:41.190
- Don't tell me to chill.

50:41.190 --> 50:42.023
What do you think, I've ruined your life?

50:42.023 --> 50:42.856
- I didn't say that.

50:42.856 --> 50:45.680
I don't think that, but
I need you to sit down

50:45.680 --> 50:48.653
and chill out or I'm gonna lose my job.

50:53.100 --> 50:53.933
- Sorry.

50:55.390 --> 50:56.290
I'm freaking, too.

51:00.026 --> 51:02.207
You're all I have.

51:02.207 --> 51:03.667
I can't lose you.

51:03.667 --> 51:04.500
- You won't.

51:08.090 --> 51:09.640
But I need to get back to work.

51:11.789 --> 51:12.622
- Okay.

51:16.504 --> 51:21.504
(upbeat music)
(singing in Spanish)

51:34.105 --> 51:36.438
- I want you to see someone.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.700
- You mean I need to tell
someone he did something

51:40.700 --> 51:42.397
so you can use it against him.

51:48.190 --> 51:49.163
- I love you.

51:52.550 --> 51:55.560
And I want you to be happy again.

51:55.560 --> 51:56.483
- Again like when?

51:57.400 --> 51:58.650
Like when you beat me up?

51:59.810 --> 52:02.550
Like when you refused
to let me have a dad?

52:02.550 --> 52:05.163
To even know who he is? (scoffs)

52:17.775 --> 52:19.525
- I've made mistakes.

52:27.553 --> 52:30.693
I know that. Okay?

52:32.660 --> 52:35.920
But nothing justifies what he did to you.

52:35.920 --> 52:36.943
- Okay. Stop.

52:39.080 --> 52:43.983
He did not touch me.

52:44.990 --> 52:46.091
All right?

52:46.091 --> 52:47.340
(Joanne sighs)

52:47.340 --> 52:50.670
And now he's gone, and you
got me nice and locked up

52:50.670 --> 52:53.780
in your prison here, so
you can just get over it.

52:53.780 --> 52:56.090
- The problem that we keep having

52:56.090 --> 52:58.930
is that you keep thinking
that I am stupid.

52:58.930 --> 53:01.830
- And you keep thinking
I'm a terrible person.

53:01.830 --> 53:02.690
- Where are you going?

53:02.690 --> 53:03.890
- To get some ice cream!

53:08.312 --> 53:10.895
(Joanne sighs)

53:19.451 --> 53:21.951
(Tylar huffs)

53:27.960 --> 53:29.490
Want some?

53:29.490 --> 53:30.323
- [Joanne] Sure.

53:32.720 --> 53:33.553
What's this?

53:45.207 --> 53:46.433
- [Devon] Steven Colver.

53:47.620 --> 53:50.203
- Steven Colver is Boston's real name.

53:53.060 --> 53:55.050
- Wait a minute, you hacked
his credit card accounts?

53:55.050 --> 53:56.150
Are you nuts?

53:56.150 --> 53:59.310
This isn't some sort of
gray area, this is illegal.

53:59.310 --> 54:00.560
Oh, for Christ's sakes, Val.

54:00.560 --> 54:02.840
I'm a freakin' cop.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.780
- Devon, I have to find something.

54:04.780 --> 54:08.110
Listen to me, Boston is a rapist
and I'm going to prove it.

54:08.110 --> 54:09.750
Tylar needs to learn.

54:09.750 --> 54:11.893
This is not sex. It's rape.

54:19.320 --> 54:21.383
- You were 23 when we hooked up.

54:22.351 --> 54:24.573
I was 17. Underage.

54:26.120 --> 54:27.063
Was that rape?

54:35.080 --> 54:37.280
- I miss you so much.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.750
I don't know how much
longer I can do this,

54:38.750 --> 54:40.383
just seeing you an hour or two.

54:41.250 --> 54:44.970
- She's never gonna let us
be together, no matter what.

54:44.970 --> 54:45.870
- Yeah, what then?

54:47.430 --> 54:51.003
- If it's her or you, I choose you.

54:53.720 --> 54:54.593
She has to go.

54:57.238 --> 54:58.338
- What do you mean go?

54:59.520 --> 55:01.420
- I mean, I need to get away from her,

55:02.370 --> 55:05.080
and I think I know how to do it

55:05.080 --> 55:07.280
- Ty, don't do anything-

55:07.280 --> 55:08.113
- Crazy?

55:09.210 --> 55:10.510
- I wasn't gonna say that.

55:12.317 --> 55:15.610
- All you need to know is
that I would do anything

55:15.610 --> 55:19.580
for us to be together, and
I know you'd do anything

55:19.580 --> 55:21.603
to be with me, right?

55:25.460 --> 55:26.360
- Do you trust me?

55:29.912 --> 55:30.745
- Yeah.

55:36.570 --> 55:37.630
- What are you gonna do with his stuff?

55:37.630 --> 55:39.030
- I'm gonna fucking burn it.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.030
- Listen, Joanne, you know
that if you do anything

55:42.030 --> 55:43.343
to him or his stuff,

55:43.343 --> 55:45.340
it's only going to
inflame things with Tylar.

55:45.340 --> 55:48.260
- Okay, what are you
suggesting that I do then?

55:48.260 --> 55:50.770
- I'm suggesting that
you don't give up on her.

55:50.770 --> 55:52.170
Forget about Boston.

55:52.170 --> 55:53.760
Why don't you just concentrate

55:53.760 --> 55:55.650
on how the two of you can move forward?

55:55.650 --> 55:57.440
- What are you saying, you
want me to drop the charges?

55:57.440 --> 55:59.070
- No, I'm saying that
you should ask yourself

55:59.070 --> 56:00.920
why you're this angry.

56:00.920 --> 56:03.610
Is it because of what he did with Tylar,

56:03.610 --> 56:05.810
or is it because they
were able to fool you?

56:07.239 --> 56:08.900
Joanne, the harder you push this,

56:08.900 --> 56:11.433
the more you are going to push her.

56:12.860 --> 56:14.470
- I don't give a shit anymore.

56:19.188 --> 56:21.521
(Val sighs)

56:28.000 --> 56:29.162
- Mom!

56:29.162 --> 56:32.158
(dramatic rock music)

56:32.158 --> 56:33.733
What the hell are you doing?

56:34.863 --> 56:36.510
- Tylar, calm down, please.

56:36.510 --> 56:38.010
- That's not yours. You can't do that.

56:38.010 --> 56:40.496
- I'm not talking about this with you.

56:40.496 --> 56:42.427
- No!
- Ow! Stop it.

56:42.427 --> 56:43.260
Tylar, stop it!

56:43.260 --> 56:44.860
Stop it, you're hurting me.

56:44.860 --> 56:46.537
What is wrong with you?

56:46.537 --> 56:50.880
- (laughs) You're a disgusting bitch.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.430
No wonder my dad wanted
nothing to do with you.

56:53.430 --> 56:57.096
You're a loser. You're a pathetic loser.

56:57.096 --> 56:59.886
- Fuck!

56:59.886 --> 57:02.797
- Do it. Do it, Mom, do it.

57:02.797 --> 57:04.393
Hit me.

57:04.393 --> 57:06.976
(somber music)

57:08.605 --> 57:10.405
- I'm not gonna hit you, baby, okay?

57:11.732 --> 57:14.649
You can call CPS if you want. Done.

57:18.229 --> 57:20.438
(Joanne screams)

57:20.438 --> 57:23.688
(dramatic rock music)

57:37.310 --> 57:38.940
- Bitch.

57:38.940 --> 57:43.940
(head thuds)
(Joanne groans)

57:45.046 --> 57:48.100
(phone beeping)

57:48.100 --> 57:51.117
(phone ringing)
(Joanne sighs)

57:51.117 --> 57:53.160
- [Operator] 911. What's your emergency?

57:53.160 --> 57:54.720
- I need to report physical abuse.

57:54.720 --> 57:55.985
- [Operator] Name?

57:55.985 --> 57:56.818
- My name?

57:56.818 --> 57:57.651
- [Operator] Yes, your name.

57:57.651 --> 57:59.010
- Joanne Witt.

57:59.010 --> 58:00.660
My daughter Tylar attacked me.

58:00.660 --> 58:03.290
I can't take it anymore. I
need her to be taken away.

58:03.290 --> 58:06.250
- [Operator] Okay. Are
you in a safe place?

58:06.250 --> 58:08.935
- No, please hurry. I'm
bleeding really badly.

58:08.935 --> 58:12.990
- [Operator] Okay, okay. (indistinct)

58:12.990 --> 58:14.390
- Hello?

58:14.390 --> 58:15.573
This is Joanne Witt.

58:16.905 --> 58:18.410
That was my daughter.

58:18.410 --> 58:20.860
- [Operator] That was your daughter?

58:20.860 --> 58:22.063
Are you injured?

58:22.063 --> 58:23.353
- Yeah. (whimpers)

58:23.353 --> 58:25.584
- [Operator] Can you
describe the injury to me?

58:25.584 --> 58:28.001
- Why won't you let me leave?

58:30.163 --> 58:30.996
No!

58:33.131 --> 58:36.693
(dramatic rock music)

58:36.693 --> 58:39.443
(sirens blaring)

58:42.693 --> 58:43.870
What do I have to do to get removed

58:43.870 --> 58:45.520
and placed in foster care?

58:45.520 --> 58:46.990
- You admitted to attacking her.

58:46.990 --> 58:49.310
I can't risk the safety
of a foster family.

58:49.310 --> 58:52.000
- Well, then what do I have
to say to get outta here?

58:52.000 --> 58:53.970
- [Officer] We'll finish
taking both of your statements,

58:53.970 --> 58:56.820
then if your mother
chooses to file charges,

58:56.820 --> 58:58.510
you'll be remanded to juvenile hall.

58:58.510 --> 59:01.323
- [Tylar] Juvie? No, I can't do that.

59:02.290 --> 59:03.123
- [Officer] Then I suggest you come

59:03.123 --> 59:04.840
to an understanding with your mother.

59:04.840 --> 59:06.287
- I wanna file charges.

59:06.287 --> 59:08.400
(ominous music)

59:08.400 --> 59:12.290
- What? No, you can't do that.

59:12.290 --> 59:13.283
You bitch!

59:14.440 --> 59:15.360
- Get her outta my sight.

59:15.360 --> 59:18.274
- No, no, Mom, please.

59:18.274 --> 59:19.908
Please, Mom, don't do this!

59:19.908 --> 59:22.132
Mom, Mom, please don't do this.

59:22.132 --> 59:23.882
Mom! No, Mom, please!

59:25.690 --> 59:26.523
Mom!

59:26.523 --> 59:29.396
- See whether a day or two
in there straightens her out,

59:29.396 --> 59:30.484
then we'll see.

59:30.484 --> 59:32.984
(tense music)

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:25.253
(tense music continues)

1:00:49.088 --> 1:00:53.105
Oh. (crying)

1:01:14.051 --> 1:01:16.801
(Joanne sobbing)

1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:32.920
(heartbeat pulsing)

1:02:16.540 --> 1:02:17.957
- Okay, got that.

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:20.443
There you go.

1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:24.360
And let's see. This one.

1:02:30.395 --> 1:02:32.130
You need somethin'?

1:02:32.130 --> 1:02:33.383
- How about a confession?

1:02:35.420 --> 1:02:38.350
- I can't talk right
now, man. I'm at work.

1:02:38.350 --> 1:02:39.800
- You know, she kept a diary.

1:02:41.050 --> 1:02:42.260
- [Boston] What?

1:02:42.260 --> 1:02:44.800
- With lots and lots of details

1:02:45.700 --> 1:02:48.603
of every twisted, disgusting
thing you two did together.

1:02:49.740 --> 1:02:52.783
Some of 'em I even had to
look up in the Kamasutra.

1:02:54.378 --> 1:02:56.970
Oh, to be that young and flexible again.

1:02:56.970 --> 1:02:58.060
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

1:02:58.060 --> 1:03:01.123
- Speakin' of young, she's underage, man.

1:03:02.260 --> 1:03:05.630
You like having sex with
minors? You do that a lot?

1:03:05.630 --> 1:03:08.120
- [Boston] It's not like that. I love her.

1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:09.393
- Oh, you love her.

1:03:10.571 --> 1:03:12.393
Well, let's hope she loves you, too,

1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:14.073
enough to wait for you,

1:03:14.073 --> 1:03:17.413
'cause it's gonna be a long
time before you see her again.

1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:22.350
- Are you arresting me?

1:03:25.050 --> 1:03:28.510
- I'm turning that diary
over to the sex crimes unit.

1:03:28.510 --> 1:03:29.523
They'll be in touch.

1:03:30.390 --> 1:03:33.193
In the meantime, you stay away from her.

1:03:34.930 --> 1:03:38.573
Or prison's gonna be the
least of your problems.

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:40.273
You got me?

1:03:59.153 --> 1:04:01.986
- This is your last chance, Tylar.

1:04:03.620 --> 1:04:04.770
Do you understand that?

1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:13.920
I changed the code, so
if you leave the gate,

1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:15.530
make sure you have somewhere to go

1:04:15.530 --> 1:04:17.280
because you're not getting back in.

1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:54.623
- Give it back.

1:04:56.120 --> 1:04:56.953
- I can't.

1:04:58.370 --> 1:05:01.340
It's in an evidence locker
at the sheriff's station.

1:05:01.340 --> 1:05:02.800
- What?

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:06.373
- Oh, you can have this back.

1:05:09.820 --> 1:05:10.946
You calling him?

1:05:10.946 --> 1:05:12.513
(phone ringing)

1:05:12.513 --> 1:05:13.990
I don't think he's gonna answer.

1:05:13.990 --> 1:05:14.900
- [Boston] Hello?

1:05:14.900 --> 1:05:16.813
Hey, just kidding. It's Boston.

1:05:16.813 --> 1:05:19.050
Can't get to the phone. Leave a message.

1:05:19.050 --> 1:05:21.793
- Don't you care that
you're ruining my life?

1:05:24.950 --> 1:05:27.920
- Dinner's gonna be
ready in about an hour.

1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:31.083
So you should clean the room.

1:05:34.601 --> 1:05:37.440
And leave this door open from now on.

1:05:40.030 --> 1:05:41.380
It's good to have you back.

1:05:53.394 --> 1:05:55.765
(door thuds)

1:05:55.765 --> 1:05:59.182
(soft suspenseful music)

1:06:03.721 --> 1:06:06.758
(phone buzzes)

1:06:06.758 --> 1:06:09.578
(Boston grunts)

1:06:09.578 --> 1:06:12.161
(somber music)

1:06:34.955 --> 1:06:35.788
- Hi.

1:06:42.570 --> 1:06:44.262
I missed you so much.

1:06:44.262 --> 1:06:45.540
- I missed you, too.

1:06:45.540 --> 1:06:47.330
- Did you delete our text
and our call history?

1:06:47.330 --> 1:06:48.267
- Yeah, I did.

1:06:49.588 --> 1:06:51.010
But I think the phone
company still has 'em.

1:06:51.010 --> 1:06:52.242
- It doesn't matter.

1:06:52.242 --> 1:06:53.653
All they can prove is that we met.

1:06:53.653 --> 1:06:56.403
- That's all they need to
prove for me to go to prison.

1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:00.313
What?

1:07:01.470 --> 1:07:03.363
- Statutory rape's a felony, right?

1:07:04.817 --> 1:07:08.173
It means 20 years. Maybe
more, I don't know.

1:07:08.173 --> 1:07:10.050
But you're going to prison

1:07:11.030 --> 1:07:15.010
unless I say I made
everything up in my diary,

1:07:15.010 --> 1:07:16.840
that I was fantasizing.

1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:20.110
- It won't work. Your mom saw us.

1:07:20.110 --> 1:07:21.580
- Right.

1:07:21.580 --> 1:07:23.950
She would have to testify
for a jury to believe

1:07:23.950 --> 1:07:26.061
what's in the diary and convict.

1:07:26.061 --> 1:07:29.593
- You said it yourself, there's
no way she won't testify.

1:07:32.303 --> 1:07:33.843
- What if she can't testify?

1:07:37.371 --> 1:07:39.990
- No. No.

1:07:39.990 --> 1:07:40.823
- Yes.
- No, I'm not even

1:07:40.823 --> 1:07:41.656
gonna go there.

1:07:41.656 --> 1:07:43.073
- What choice do we have?

1:07:44.690 --> 1:07:48.780
Either you can go to prison
until you're middle-aged

1:07:48.780 --> 1:07:50.630
and we'll never see each other again,

1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:54.250
or we can be together forever

1:07:54.250 --> 1:07:55.680
and no one will get in the way.

1:07:55.680 --> 1:07:56.680
It's a no brainer.

1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:58.223
- No, that is not who we are.

1:07:59.310 --> 1:08:01.570
- She made us that.

1:08:06.477 --> 1:08:08.060
It's not our fault.

1:08:19.899 --> 1:08:21.566
- I love you, Tylar.

1:08:23.067 --> 1:08:25.193
- It can be like this always.

1:08:27.795 --> 1:08:30.378
(somber music)

1:08:48.474 --> 1:08:51.474
(diners chattering)

1:08:52.671 --> 1:08:54.720
- Need you at the register.

1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:57.100
- [Boston] I'm not comfortable
going up front today.

1:08:57.100 --> 1:08:58.957
- Come on, I let you keep your job.

1:09:00.419 --> 1:09:03.973
- I know, and that's cool of you,

1:09:03.973 --> 1:09:07.270
but I'd rather quit
than go out there today.

1:09:07.270 --> 1:09:10.270
(diners chattering)

1:09:14.178 --> 1:09:16.845
(ominous music)

1:10:24.476 --> 1:10:25.393
- Come on.

1:10:30.717 --> 1:10:31.550
Is that them?

1:10:31.550 --> 1:10:33.220
- Let's just get outta here, okay?

1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:35.342
Come on, we can go to Belize.

1:10:35.342 --> 1:10:36.247
We can go anywhere.
- No we can't.

1:10:36.247 --> 1:10:38.990
I'm a minor, remember?

1:10:38.990 --> 1:10:41.363
I can't leave the country
without Satan's permission.

1:10:42.750 --> 1:10:45.067
This is the only way we can be together.

1:10:47.228 --> 1:10:49.084
Here, let me see them.

1:10:49.084 --> 1:10:52.667
(ominous music continues)

1:11:14.032 --> 1:11:17.500
- What if she wakes up before we can...

1:11:17.500 --> 1:11:20.450
- She might have had a
Valium or four in her wine.

1:11:22.643 --> 1:11:23.476
Come on.

1:11:24.590 --> 1:11:27.590
(suspenseful music)

1:12:03.663 --> 1:12:05.667
(Val gasps)

1:12:05.667 --> 1:12:06.500
- Tylar!

1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:09.250
(dramatic music)

1:12:47.812 --> 1:12:50.729
(soft tense music)

1:13:21.286 --> 1:13:24.119
(dramatic music)

1:13:40.132 --> 1:13:42.215
- Ty. What are you doing?

1:13:44.529 --> 1:13:47.112
(gentle music)

1:14:19.805 --> 1:14:22.805
(singer vocalizing)

1:14:26.998 --> 1:14:31.998
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:14:44.303 --> 1:14:46.043
- We're free.

1:14:46.043 --> 1:14:47.626
- Together forever.

1:14:48.798 --> 1:14:53.798
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:15:30.700 --> 1:15:31.944
- I'm starving.

1:15:31.944 --> 1:15:36.361
- Go ahead and get started.
I'll be down in a minute.

1:15:56.059 --> 1:15:58.892
(fire crackling)

1:16:27.963 --> 1:16:29.333
- So I was thinking.

1:16:31.635 --> 1:16:33.463
We can do whatever we want now, right?

1:16:34.558 --> 1:16:36.810
- (chuckles) Yeah.

1:16:36.810 --> 1:16:39.343
- Well what I want is to marry you

1:16:42.327 --> 1:16:46.130
and start a family as soon as it's legal.

1:16:46.130 --> 1:16:49.770
- Wait, are you proposing to me?

1:16:49.770 --> 1:16:51.801
- I wanna get you a ring.

1:16:51.801 --> 1:16:53.101
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1:16:56.244 --> 1:16:58.911
(gentle music)

1:17:00.330 --> 1:17:03.303
(laughs) I didn't think
that I could be this happy.

1:17:04.450 --> 1:17:08.243
You make me so, so, so happy.

1:17:09.836 --> 1:17:11.120
- So it's official then?

1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:12.793
- Yes, my fiance.

1:17:13.810 --> 1:17:17.573
You're looking at the
future Mrs. Tylar Colver.

1:17:18.675 --> 1:17:19.508
- Oh.

1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:24.633
I like that.

1:17:27.671 --> 1:17:30.338
(phone buzzing)

1:17:38.490 --> 1:17:41.073
(phone chimes)

1:17:44.430 --> 1:17:47.400
- [Automated Voice] You
have one new message.

1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:49.370
- [Val] Hey, Jojo, I saw
your car in the driveway.

1:17:49.370 --> 1:17:50.680
Is everything okay?

1:17:50.680 --> 1:17:52.540
Let me know if we're still on for lunch.

1:17:52.540 --> 1:17:53.700
Call me.

1:17:53.700 --> 1:17:55.350
- What do we do?

1:17:55.350 --> 1:17:56.183
- We stay calm.

1:18:03.810 --> 1:18:05.833
- Honey. Honey.

1:18:08.037 --> 1:18:09.620
- What. What is it?

1:18:11.172 --> 1:18:14.520
- It's 11 o'clock and Joanne
hasn't called me back yet.

1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:17.363
It's gonna be a hundred degrees
and they have a fire going.

1:18:19.527 --> 1:18:21.800
- You want me go to over there?

1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:23.009
(phone buzzes)

1:18:23.009 --> 1:18:26.259
(text bubbles chiming)

1:18:36.644 --> 1:18:37.727
There you go.

1:18:39.167 --> 1:18:40.200
- What are you doing?

1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:42.490
- Joanne says she's going back to bed.

1:18:42.490 --> 1:18:44.550
So am I.

1:18:44.550 --> 1:18:47.200
Just be happy she and Tylar
are gettin' along, honey.

1:18:51.745 --> 1:18:53.651
- [Boston] You think she bought it?

1:18:53.651 --> 1:18:54.500
- I don't know.

1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:56.323
Val is a serious pain in my ass.

1:18:58.782 --> 1:19:00.233
- What are you doing?

1:19:01.150 --> 1:19:02.700
- Mom is emailing sick to work.

1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:05.130
We should have done that hours ago.

1:19:05.130 --> 1:19:06.430
We have to be more careful.

1:19:06.430 --> 1:19:08.370
- Okay, so it's Friday.

1:19:08.370 --> 1:19:10.373
What if she doesn't get better by Monday?

1:19:11.430 --> 1:19:13.280
- We will worry about that on Monday.

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.440
Hey, you know what we should now?

1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:18.980
Engagement party.

1:19:18.980 --> 1:19:21.770
We'll invite all our friends over. Yeah?

1:19:21.770 --> 1:19:23.495
- What friends?

1:19:23.495 --> 1:19:25.810
- Come on, we're getting married.

1:19:25.810 --> 1:19:28.493
They'll have to accept us now. You'll see.

1:19:29.380 --> 1:19:31.030
How about you call God

1:19:31.030 --> 1:19:34.120
and I'll call Squishy and Graham Cracker?

1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:36.000
Yeah? (giggles)

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:36.930
- [Boston] Party?

1:19:36.930 --> 1:19:37.830
- [Tylar] Par-tay!

1:19:42.260 --> 1:19:43.093
- [Boston] Deal.

1:19:48.330 --> 1:19:50.810
- Yeah, and maybe you could bring, like,

1:19:50.810 --> 1:19:52.193
some beer or whatever?

1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:55.340
If we leave, we can't get back in.

1:19:55.340 --> 1:19:56.684
Long story.

1:19:56.684 --> 1:19:58.642
(buttons beeping)

1:19:58.642 --> 1:19:59.610
(gate rattling)

1:19:59.610 --> 1:20:00.610
Squishy, I gotta go.

1:20:04.040 --> 1:20:06.390
Damn, I can't believe my
mom gave her the code.

1:20:08.608 --> 1:20:10.540
- We gotta pretend not to be here.

1:20:10.540 --> 1:20:12.510
- No, it won't work.

1:20:12.510 --> 1:20:15.110
She's like a rabid dog.
She won't go away easily.

1:20:15.110 --> 1:20:16.293
- [Boston] Okay, what then?

1:20:17.791 --> 1:20:19.136
- We have to be ready.

1:20:19.136 --> 1:20:19.969
(doorbell rings)

1:20:19.969 --> 1:20:20.802
For anything.

1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:26.100
- Hi, Val.

1:20:26.100 --> 1:20:27.530
- No school today?

1:20:27.530 --> 1:20:29.950
- Mom and I were up really late.

1:20:29.950 --> 1:20:32.220
So she said it was cool if I skipped.

1:20:32.220 --> 1:20:35.490
- Yeah, I heard you patched things up.

1:20:35.490 --> 1:20:36.890
- Started to.

1:20:36.890 --> 1:20:37.803
- Sounds hopeful.

1:20:39.330 --> 1:20:40.680
It's awfully dark in there.

1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:44.410
- Yeah, Mom's got a migraine,

1:20:44.410 --> 1:20:46.940
so the light really bothers her.

1:20:46.940 --> 1:20:47.870
- I made soup.

1:20:47.870 --> 1:20:49.190
It'll just take me a minute to microwave

1:20:49.190 --> 1:20:50.400
and then I can take it to her.

1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:53.200
- She's sleeping, so I'll
just take it to her later.

1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:54.993
- It's okay. I'll do it.

1:20:55.980 --> 1:20:57.130
I wanna see her myself.

1:20:58.230 --> 1:20:59.893
- Okay, but she's resting.

1:21:00.905 --> 1:21:02.453
(phone ringing)
- Joanne!

1:21:05.610 --> 1:21:06.443
Hey, honey.

1:21:08.340 --> 1:21:10.040
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:12.493
No. No, no, no, I'll go with you.

1:21:15.604 --> 1:21:16.750
- Is something wrong?

1:21:16.750 --> 1:21:18.880
- Yeah, Devon's mom was
just rushed to the hospital.

1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:19.980
They think she had a stroke.

1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:21.700
- [Tylar] Oh no. I hope she's okay.

1:21:21.700 --> 1:21:22.970

1:21:22.970 --> 1:21:25.533

1:24:52.110 --> 1:24:53.460
You're on private property.

1:24:54.370 --> 1:24:56.920
You broke through our
gate. That's illegal.

1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:59.550
- That's not gonna fly. Where is she?

1:24:59.550 --> 1:25:00.650

1:25:06.270 --> 1:25:07.490
And when we are,

1:25:07.490 --> 1:25:10.340
she better be upstairs with
a cold compress on her head.

What do you want, Boston?

1:25:57.086 --> 1:26:01.253

anybody about this, right?

1:26:05.090 --> 1:26:08.711

1:26:08.711 --> 1:26:13.211

1:26:32.351 --> 1:26:33.270
I mean, it depends how fast

1:26:33.270 --> 1:26:35.340
they can find a judge on the weekend.

1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:36.970

I mean, even if we can
get the body out, which...

1:26:45.970 --> 1:26:48.850
The gate is the only way
out, and if we leave,

1:26:48.850 --> 1:26:50.223
it's open season on us.

1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:40.343
You can talk to me.

- Why didn't you tell
us about this before?

1:30:09.717 --> 1:30:12.857
- But seriously, why
are you telling us now?

1:30:12.857 --> 1:30:15.170
You just made us accessories to murder!

1:30:15.170 --> 1:30:19.010
- We need to call the police.

1:30:19.010 --> 1:30:21.040
- No. No, man.

1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:22.530
- What are you talking about?
- I did this.

1:30:22.530 --> 1:30:24.060
They met because of me.

1:30:24.060 --> 1:30:25.550
- We need to get our shit together.

1:30:25.550 --> 1:30:29.270
Okay, we need to do something about this

1:30:29.270 --> 1:30:31.430
before they do anything else.

1:30:31.430 --> 1:30:32.263
- Like what?

1:30:32.263 --> 1:30:33.840
- I don't know, man.

1:30:33.840 --> 1:30:35.623

1:31:15.990 --> 1:31:16.823
- Let's do this.

1:31:20.657 --> 1:31:23.330
- Okay, the sooner we go to the police,

1:31:23.330 --> 1:31:25.913
the less we're a part of this, right?

1:31:25.913 --> 1:31:27.530
- How do we even know this is true?

1:31:27.530 --> 1:31:29.603
Maybe they're just messing with your head.

1:31:30.649 --> 1:31:32.520
- No man.

1:31:32.520 --> 1:31:36.703
You weren't there, but they're
in some fucked mental place.

1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:41.280
- I was supposed to be
in Tahoe two hours ago,

1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:44.740
so as far as I'm concerned,
I never heard any of this.

1:31:44.740 --> 1:31:46.440
- Even if they're really suicidal.

1:31:47.847 --> 1:31:49.257
♪ Life was so hard it made me weep ♪

1:31:49.257 --> 1:31:51.890
♪ Built to last, this girl ain't weak ♪

1:31:51.890 --> 1:31:53.870
- What the hell are you guys doing?

1:31:53.870 --> 1:31:55.440
- Eloping.

1:31:55.440 --> 1:31:57.137
- To where?

1:31:57.137 --> 1:31:58.030
- Look, it doesn't matter.

1:31:58.030 --> 1:31:59.130
Okay, Squishy.

1:31:59.130 --> 1:32:01.479
I left Ty's bag behind
your house in our spot.

1:32:01.479 --> 1:32:02.821
You know what I'm talking about?

1:32:02.821 --> 1:32:04.010
- [Squishy] Yeah, but...

1:32:04.010 --> 1:32:06.421
- Go get it and then call me, okay?

1:32:06.421 --> 1:32:08.880
- Ty, don't do this.

1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:11.213
Whatever you're doing,
we can figure a way out.

1:32:11.213 --> 1:32:13.600
- I'm not looking for a way out, Graham.

1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:15.292
I already have one.

1:32:15.292 --> 1:32:16.590
- [Graham] What does that mean?

1:32:16.590 --> 1:32:19.400
- Please, just tell us where you're going.

1:32:19.400 --> 1:32:20.600
- [Tylar] To our castle.

1:32:21.590 --> 1:32:22.453
- What castle?

1:32:23.457 --> 1:32:25.070
(phone beeps)

1:32:25.070 --> 1:32:26.237
What the fuck?

1:32:33.891 --> 1:32:35.700
- [Dispatcher] Liberty 25, code 6.

1:32:35.700 --> 1:32:37.117
105 North Avenue.

1:32:43.830 --> 1:32:46.780
- They won't get very far. There's a BOLO.

1:32:46.780 --> 1:32:48.700
- Credit card purchases on the mom's card

1:32:48.700 --> 1:32:50.324
point to maybe Tahoe.

1:32:50.324 --> 1:32:51.474
- All right, thank you.

1:32:52.470 --> 1:32:54.430
Well, are we done here?

1:32:54.430 --> 1:32:56.610
I'd like to get my wife home to rest.

1:32:56.610 --> 1:32:57.443
- Of course.

1:32:59.620 --> 1:33:00.877
- Come on, honey.

1:33:02.060 --> 1:33:03.027
Come on, honey.

1:33:07.450 --> 1:33:09.970
(birds chirping)

1:33:09.970 --> 1:33:11.230
All right, what are you up to?

1:33:11.230 --> 1:33:12.533
- Investigating fraud.

1:33:14.010 --> 1:33:15.810
These are the purchases
made on Joanne's credit card

1:33:15.810 --> 1:33:17.460
in the last five hours.

1:33:17.460 --> 1:33:21.010
- Gas station, mini mart,
another gas station.

1:33:21.010 --> 1:33:23.550
All in the direction of the mountains.

1:33:23.550 --> 1:33:25.737
Could be headin' for Tahoe, maybe.

1:33:25.737 --> 1:33:27.310
- Except look.

1:33:27.310 --> 1:33:30.990
This mini mart is 20 miles
past the first gas station.

1:33:30.990 --> 1:33:33.240
The second gas station
is 20 miles past that.

1:33:34.980 --> 1:33:37.193
Who stops every 20 miles to get gas?

1:33:38.437 --> 1:33:40.493
And make regular purchases?

1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:43.480
- Somebody wants us to believe

1:33:43.480 --> 1:33:44.868
they're heading for the mountains.

1:33:44.868 --> 1:33:47.618
(ominous music)

1:33:52.950 --> 1:33:53.783
- [Val] I'm telling you,

1:33:53.783 --> 1:33:55.260
they've got you on a wild goose chase.

1:33:55.260 --> 1:33:57.620
- Listen to her. She knows
what she's talking about.

1:33:57.620 --> 1:33:59.540
- Even if they did throw
us off their scent,

1:33:59.540 --> 1:34:01.930
their plates will be caught
by the BOLO sooner or later.

1:34:01.930 --> 1:34:04.330
- Do we want 'em found sooner or later?

1:34:04.330 --> 1:34:06.030
- They ditch the car, it's gonna be later,

1:34:06.030 --> 1:34:07.210
maybe too much later.

1:34:07.210 --> 1:34:08.500
- [Val] I need Joanne's phone.

1:34:08.500 --> 1:34:09.570
- It's been bagged for evidence.

1:34:09.570 --> 1:34:11.350
I can't let you handle it.

1:34:11.350 --> 1:34:12.530
- Look, that phone'll have calls

1:34:12.530 --> 1:34:13.963
to and from Colver's number.

1:34:13.963 --> 1:34:14.796
- [Officer] I get that.

1:34:14.796 --> 1:34:16.450
- It's a shortcut to tracking his cell.

1:34:16.450 --> 1:34:18.000
- Maybe we'll get lucky.

1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:19.930
- I can't just break the chain of custody.

1:34:19.930 --> 1:34:21.480
We may need it to put him away.

1:34:23.577 --> 1:34:26.800
- One of Tylar and Colver's
friends just called 911.

1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:27.840
You were right.

1:34:27.840 --> 1:34:29.640
They sent her phone and
the mom's credit card

1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:30.840
off with someone else.

1:34:30.840 --> 1:34:31.840
Get the vic's phone.

1:34:33.140 --> 1:34:34.861
It's a good thing.

1:34:34.861 --> 1:34:38.361
(soft suspenseful music)

1:34:49.601 --> 1:34:52.281
- It's cheesier than I remember.

1:34:52.281 --> 1:34:54.790
(Boston sighs)

1:34:54.790 --> 1:34:57.523
- According to Yelp it's
been closed for years.

1:34:58.710 --> 1:34:59.563
- That sucks.

1:35:00.820 --> 1:35:03.220
But hey, at least I got
to see it one more time.

1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:07.010
- [Val] They could be crossing a border

1:35:07.010 --> 1:35:09.080
or hurting somebody else right now.

1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:10.500
- So you're sure their
friend really doesn't know

1:35:10.500 --> 1:35:11.700
where they're headed, huh?

1:35:11.700 --> 1:35:13.290
- We shook him down pretty good.

1:35:13.290 --> 1:35:14.690
I don't think he was lying.

1:35:14.690 --> 1:35:17.870
All they told him was
something about a castle,

1:35:17.870 --> 1:35:19.400
but he didn't know what that meant.

1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:22.253
- A castle. Follow me.

1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:24.510
- So what do we do now?

1:35:27.290 --> 1:35:28.840
- Let's find somewhere to stay.

1:35:33.414 --> 1:35:36.414
(soft somber music)

1:35:41.660 --> 1:35:42.530
- The castle restaurant

1:35:42.530 --> 1:35:44.630
Joanne took Tylar to for her birthday.

1:35:44.630 --> 1:35:47.740
She said Tylar thought it
was the best day of her life.

1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:48.690
Let's go.

1:35:48.690 --> 1:35:49.724
- Where are you going?

1:35:49.724 --> 1:35:54.724
- L.A.

1:36:07.076 --> 1:36:09.743
(Boston grunts)

1:36:17.296 --> 1:36:18.296
- I'm sorry.

1:36:20.130 --> 1:36:20.980
- Doesn't matter.

1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:27.750
Place is perfect.

- When I was younger, I

1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:34.110
I couldn't say my Rs, so
people thought I sounded

1:38:34.110 --> 1:38:36.233
like I had a Massachusetts accent.

1:38:38.290 --> 1:38:42.773
So they called me Boston and it stuck.

1:38:45.423 --> 1:38:48.850

- [Val] What did he say?

1:39:19.073 --> 1:39:20.550
- They're confirming he's in L.A.,

1:39:20.550 --> 1:39:23.150
triangulating his phone now
to get an exact location.

1:39:23.150 --> 1:39:23.983
- To where?

1:39:23.983 --> 1:39:25.270
- They're sending local units.

1:39:25.270 --> 1:39:26.103
- Where?

1:39:26.103 --> 1:39:27.633
- They asked us not to interfere.

1:39:32.455 --> 1:39:35.205

No, you said you wouldn't leave me.

1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:54.450
(dramatic music)

1:40:11.310 --> 1:40:13.193
You swore you'd stay with me.

1:40:13.193 --> 1:40:14.958
- Police, open up!
- Boston.

1:40:14.958 --> 1:40:16.812
Don't leave me.

1:40:45.289 --> 1:40:48.039

1:42:02.888 --> 1:42:03.910

1:42:03.910 --> 1:42:05.460
more of that rat poison.

1:42:05.460 --> 1:42:08.240
So, now that you're gonna live, tell me,

1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:09.583
did Tylar make you do it?

1:42:10.630 --> 1:42:11.730
- I'm tellin' ya, man.

1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:14.580
Ty had nothing to do with it.

1:42:14.580 --> 1:42:17.430
- So you two made sure to get
your stories straight, huh?

1:42:18.350 --> 1:42:22.113
Just in case death
didn't quite do you part.

1:42:23.919 --> 1:42:25.487
Haven't heard that one before.

1:42:27.130 --> 1:42:29.283
You two are a piece of work.

1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:31.763
- I couldn't go in.

1:42:32.790 --> 1:42:37.150
- It was all me. I stabbed her.

1:42:37.150 --> 1:42:38.950
- I just curled up outside her door.

1:42:40.780 --> 1:42:41.880
And she was screaming.

1:42:42.990 --> 1:42:47.990
So, I put my hands over
my ears and I hummed.

1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:50.673
- I killed her.

1:42:53.180 --> 1:42:54.453
- Guess that's love.

1:42:59.010 --> 1:43:00.453
You wanted her dead.

1:43:01.800 --> 1:43:04.595
You've been quoted as
saying that many times.

1:43:04.595 --> 1:43:08.023
- No. No, I loved my mom.

1:43:09.630 --> 1:43:11.003
I miss her so much.

1:43:15.100 --> 1:43:16.463
- 20 stab wounds.

1:43:18.250 --> 1:43:20.500
The one to her neck
nearly took her head off.

1:43:22.740 --> 1:43:26.413
That's not love. That's rage.

1:43:32.310 --> 1:43:36.143
(officer chattering on radio)

1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:43.970
It's a tragedy that three
lives had to be ruined

1:43:43.970 --> 1:43:47.750
just to save you the inconvenience
of a slap on the wrist.

1:43:47.750 --> 1:43:50.970
- 20 years for felony rape
ain't a slap on the wrist, man.

1:43:50.970 --> 1:43:53.470
- Neither's life in prison
or a stay on death row.

1:43:55.895 --> 1:43:58.200
Boy, where'd you get 20 years?

1:43:58.200 --> 1:43:59.770
Worst you woulda faced for statutory

1:43:59.770 --> 1:44:03.430
is a misdemeanor charge,
most likely probation.

1:44:03.430 --> 1:44:04.673
No jail time.

1:44:06.330 --> 1:44:08.820
- You said I would go
away for a long time.

1:44:08.820 --> 1:44:10.963
