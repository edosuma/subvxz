00:01.841 --> 00:04.925
- <i>Previously on</i> American Gothic...
- I need help. So do you,

00:04.927 --> 00:06.702
<i>and Jack needs to be
with stable people.</i>

00:06.727 --> 00:07.294
Go ahead.

00:07.296 --> 00:08.462
(child screaming)

00:08.464 --> 00:09.496
He needs therapy.

00:09.498 --> 00:10.964
What the hell is in our genes, Tess?

00:10.966 --> 00:12.599
MODERATOR: <i>Jenny Windham, Channel 12.</i>

00:12.601 --> 00:14.735
I'm happy you changed your mind.

00:14.737 --> 00:16.670
(gasps)

00:16.672 --> 00:18.071
You got me all wobbly.

00:18.073 --> 00:19.673
- I never thought that you would...
- What?

00:19.675 --> 00:22.009
- Trust you?
- No, mean something to me.

00:22.011 --> 00:23.944
He left this little piece of
ivory at the crime scene.

00:23.946 --> 00:26.046
Car takes off as soon as the door shuts.

00:26.048 --> 00:27.614
Someone else is driving.

00:27.616 --> 00:29.483
The Silver Bells
Killer wasn't one person.

00:29.485 --> 00:30.684
<i>It was two.</i>

00:30.686 --> 00:31.752
GARRETT: <i>Well, what if</i>

00:31.754 --> 00:33.320
I do want to tell the truth?

00:33.322 --> 00:35.055
What would you do?

00:39.160 --> 00:41.728
It's just a lot of money.

00:42.730 --> 00:44.300
GARRETT: And you've confirmed

00:44.303 --> 00:46.266
that the funds are available.

00:46.268 --> 00:48.569
So, what's the problem?

00:49.704 --> 00:51.872
I'd like to call Mrs.
Hawthorne directly.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.248
$200,000?

01:01.250 --> 01:03.517
Y-yes, and he said to tell you that

01:03.519 --> 01:06.320
he thinks it's in the
family's best interest

01:06.322 --> 01:08.956
that you approve this transaction.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.608 --> 01:27.908
Uh, is Christina here?

01:27.910 --> 01:30.310
Uh, Dr. Morales is taking some time off.

01:31.145 --> 01:32.546
Are you the guy who...

01:32.548 --> 01:33.680
Do you have a safe?

01:33.682 --> 01:35.182
Pardon?

01:42.123 --> 01:45.125
That's for the clinic.

01:48.229 --> 01:51.298
You should probably
put that in the safe.

01:53.001 --> 01:54.268
Thank you.

01:59.374 --> 02:01.975
What did you do with all that money?

02:03.177 --> 02:04.678
I gave it away.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.780
What? Why?

02:06.782 --> 02:10.317
Uh, it felt like the right thing to do.

02:10.318 --> 02:12.519
I'm gonna take a stab

02:12.521 --> 02:16.890
at this whole being part
of the family thing.

02:16.892 --> 02:18.825
You forged a check for 200 grand

02:18.827 --> 02:20.661
in the spirit of family togetherness?

02:20.663 --> 02:23.630
Well, there's some atoning to do...

02:23.632 --> 02:25.132
don't you think?

02:25.134 --> 02:27.034
ALISON: Jennifer Windham

02:27.036 --> 02:28.435
strikes again.

02:28.437 --> 02:29.703
A staffer just texted me.

02:29.705 --> 02:31.872
JENNIFER: Has the shadow of

02:31.874 --> 02:33.940
Silver Bells claimed yet another victim?

02:33.942 --> 02:35.542
My inside source tells me

02:35.544 --> 02:39.260
Mitchell Hawthorne's son,
Cam, has just entered rehab

02:39.261 --> 02:40.414
for drug addiction.

02:40.416 --> 02:41.982
Is she wearing a turtleneck?

02:41.984 --> 02:43.984
...of Cam's drug abuse, it leaves

02:43.986 --> 02:45.452
this reporter to wonder, what
did the Hawthornes know...

02:45.454 --> 02:46.787
We're being harassed by
a woman in a turtleneck.

02:46.789 --> 02:48.622
- ...about their father...
- Okay, last week

02:48.624 --> 02:49.890
it's "Hawthorne Concrete

02:49.892 --> 02:51.325
in dire financial straits," then it's

02:51.327 --> 02:52.592
"Staffers jumping ship

02:52.594 --> 02:54.161
at the Hawthorne estate," now this.

02:54.163 --> 02:56.196
Where is this woman
getting all these stories?

02:56.198 --> 02:58.565
Well, uh, this is sensitive information.

02:58.567 --> 03:01.301
It has to be someone close to us.

03:01.303 --> 03:02.669
Maybe it was Naomi.

03:02.671 --> 03:04.171
She must feel bitter

03:04.173 --> 03:05.639
about getting fired.

03:05.641 --> 03:07.107
No, she wouldn't do that.

03:07.109 --> 03:08.375
How do you know?

03:09.210 --> 03:11.845
I know her.

03:13.448 --> 03:15.315
Well, this woman

03:15.317 --> 03:17.317
can't seem to get enough of us, so...

03:17.319 --> 03:20.354
what if we just give her what she wants?

03:30.898 --> 03:32.399
I know who you are.

03:32.401 --> 03:34.368
Ah...

03:34.370 --> 03:37.376
well, everyone does, thanks
to that tacky reporter.

03:37.522 --> 03:38.872
Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.

03:38.874 --> 03:40.841
Um, you created my favorite comic strip.

03:40.843 --> 03:42.676
I love <i>Roger's Cube.</i>

03:42.678 --> 03:44.578
Oh... really?

03:44.580 --> 03:45.679
Yeah.

03:45.681 --> 03:46.880
I'm April,

03:46.882 --> 03:48.115
one of the nurses here.

03:48.117 --> 03:50.117
- Cam.
- Hi.

03:50.119 --> 03:51.151
Cute kid.

03:51.153 --> 03:52.152
Oh, yeah, he is.

03:52.154 --> 03:54.788
Um, that's my son, Jack,

03:54.790 --> 03:55.856
and that's, uh,

03:55.858 --> 03:58.458
Sophie, she's my...

03:58.460 --> 03:59.993
uh...

03:59.995 --> 04:02.295
Who needs labels?

04:02.297 --> 04:04.030
So, can I have the inside scoop?

04:04.032 --> 04:05.432
What's gonna happen to Roger next?

04:05.434 --> 04:06.433
Um...

04:06.435 --> 04:07.868
I'm stuck.

04:07.870 --> 04:09.136
Cartoonist's block.

04:09.138 --> 04:10.370
Mm.

04:10.372 --> 04:12.439
Feel like the drugs helped you draw?

04:12.441 --> 04:15.041
Sadly, yeah.

04:15.043 --> 04:16.709
How long have you been an addict?

04:16.712 --> 04:18.644
Hmm... since I was a teenager.

04:18.647 --> 04:20.380
I just found out my grandma was, too,

04:20.382 --> 04:22.015
so, it's in my genes,

04:22.017 --> 04:24.317
along with... who knows what else.

04:24.319 --> 04:25.352
Well, I think

04:25.354 --> 04:26.553
the great thing is that

04:26.555 --> 04:28.789
we don't have to stay what we are.

04:28.791 --> 04:32.159
Being a frog aficionado, you
must know all about that.

04:32.161 --> 04:35.595
I'm not really sure I
know what you're getting at,

04:35.597 --> 04:36.863
but I want to.

04:36.865 --> 04:38.098
(chuckles)

04:38.100 --> 04:39.900
Okay, so, West African frogs,

04:39.902 --> 04:41.968
they flip their
gender whenever they want.

04:41.970 --> 04:43.770
They don't let a fundamental
truth they've been dealt

04:43.772 --> 04:45.172
dictate their whole lives.

04:45.174 --> 04:48.909
If they want to change, they just... do.

04:48.911 --> 04:51.611
So, they just give genetics the finger?

04:51.613 --> 04:54.748
Yeah, masters of transformation.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.050
West African frogs.

04:57.052 --> 04:58.652
Jack's gonna love that.

04:58.654 --> 05:00.554
(chuckles)

05:03.624 --> 05:08.195
Good news is SBK drove an
'85 Cadillac Fleetwood.

05:08.197 --> 05:11.164
Bad news is Mitchell
Hawthorne never owned one.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.666
Neither did any of his family

05:12.668 --> 05:14.935
or any of his known associates.

05:14.937 --> 05:16.937
(sighs) I got a list

05:16.939 --> 05:20.474
of 164 people who owned this car, 164

05:20.476 --> 05:21.842
potential suspects.

05:21.844 --> 05:22.843
(Linda sighs)

05:22.845 --> 05:24.878
This is gonna take months.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.147
You know, it would only
take us hours if the lieutenant

05:27.149 --> 05:29.249
would authorize
additional manpower for this lead.

05:31.853 --> 05:35.388
You ever get the feeling
you're talking to a wall?

05:35.390 --> 05:37.858
You see this?

05:37.860 --> 05:40.427
Where the light bounces off right there?

05:40.429 --> 05:42.262
Where?

05:43.164 --> 05:44.812
Car's got a dent.

05:45.052 --> 05:46.199
Right rear panel.

05:46.201 --> 05:47.501
A dent could mean a crash.

05:47.503 --> 05:49.369
A crash might mean an accident report.

05:51.239 --> 05:53.640
Accidents involving navy

05:53.642 --> 05:57.010
Cadillac Fleetwoods between 1985

05:57.012 --> 05:59.412
and 1999.

05:59.414 --> 06:00.514
If this works,

06:00.516 --> 06:01.781
just remember it was my idea.

06:01.783 --> 06:04.050
(chuckles)

06:04.052 --> 06:05.218
Here we go.

06:05.220 --> 06:07.654
Accident report from 1991,

06:07.656 --> 06:09.589
damage to the left quarter panel.

06:09.591 --> 06:12.425
Registered to a James Canby of Saugus.

06:12.427 --> 06:14.160
If we're right about this,

06:14.162 --> 06:16.596
this could be the other
half of Silver Bells.

06:16.598 --> 06:18.431
You never said we were stopping anywhere

06:18.433 --> 06:19.666
on the way to camp.

06:19.668 --> 06:21.101
It won't take long, like 20 minutes,

06:21.103 --> 06:22.202
then straight to camp.

06:22.204 --> 06:23.203
Okay.

06:23.205 --> 06:24.538
I can make it.

06:24.540 --> 06:27.207
Patience is a virtue.

06:27.209 --> 06:30.544
That's from <i>Psychomachia</i>, fifth century.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.613
NURSE: The doctor will see you now.

06:33.615 --> 06:35.048
Okay.

06:35.050 --> 06:37.551
Okay, I'll be right back.

06:39.420 --> 06:40.754
Okay, don't be alarmed.

06:40.756 --> 06:42.622
I can't find a heartbeat right now,

06:42.624 --> 06:43.990
but that happens sometimes early on.

06:43.992 --> 06:45.692
Does that mean I'm not pregnant anymore?

06:45.694 --> 06:47.394
Don't worry, we'll
schedule an ultrasound in a couple

06:47.396 --> 06:49.262
of days to put your mind at ease, okay?

06:49.264 --> 06:51.464
Okay.

06:52.733 --> 06:55.168
Will Brady be able to
make it to that one?

06:55.170 --> 06:56.836
Yes, I hope so.

06:56.838 --> 07:00.073
He's been really, really busy lately.

07:00.942 --> 07:03.176
But he does know you're pregnant?

07:03.178 --> 07:05.278
Yes, of course.

07:20.377 --> 07:21.943
JACK: <i>I'm most excited</i>

07:21.945 --> 07:23.878
about learning which plants are edible

07:23.880 --> 07:25.313
and which are poisonous.

07:25.315 --> 07:26.514
Or medicinal.

07:26.516 --> 07:27.682
Those, too.

07:27.684 --> 07:29.818
MAN: <i>Welcome to Baindu Academy.</i>

07:29.820 --> 07:32.086
Do you know what we do here, Jack?

07:32.088 --> 07:33.888
- Teach survival skills?
- In a way.

07:33.890 --> 07:35.924
We help young folks like yourself

07:35.926 --> 07:38.059
find better ways to
handle certain challenges.

07:38.061 --> 07:39.627
Is this like therapy?

07:39.629 --> 07:41.830
Because my mom said there's
nothing wrong with me.

07:41.832 --> 07:43.832
And your mom is right.

07:43.834 --> 07:44.866
You're simply built

07:44.868 --> 07:46.468
in a different way than others.

07:46.470 --> 07:48.036
So are some of our best and brightest.

07:48.038 --> 07:50.839
Politicians, surgeons, CEOs...

07:50.841 --> 07:52.674
Medical examiners?

07:52.676 --> 07:54.275
Yeah.

07:54.277 --> 07:56.444
After I talk to your
aunt here for awhile,

07:56.446 --> 07:57.979
we'll take you on a
tour of the whole facility.

07:57.981 --> 07:59.080
How's that sound?

07:59.082 --> 08:00.715
Could you take Jack

08:00.717 --> 08:02.750
outside for a bit?

08:05.221 --> 08:07.689
<i>I know this must be such
a difficult time,</i>

08:07.691 --> 08:12.827
but it's actually helpful
to know Jack's... family history.

08:12.829 --> 08:15.263
You mean my father.

08:15.265 --> 08:16.865
Mm-hmm.

08:16.867 --> 08:19.100
Psychopathy can be genetic.

08:19.102 --> 08:22.437
It's actually called the
"warrior gene", MAO-A.

08:22.439 --> 08:26.107
Monoamine oxidase A, linked to violent,

08:26.109 --> 08:29.110
or let's say aggressive, behavior.

08:29.112 --> 08:31.513
I see.

08:31.515 --> 08:33.313
In order to devise a treatment program,

08:33.316 --> 08:35.183
it's useful to know if
a child's tendencies

08:35.184 --> 08:37.051
are more nature

08:37.053 --> 08:39.787
than nurture.

08:41.924 --> 08:43.057
(doorbell buzzes)

08:43.058 --> 08:44.492
ALISON: <i>I'm sure you can</i>

08:44.494 --> 08:48.296
understand how
painful your constant reports

08:48.298 --> 08:49.697
are for this family.

08:49.699 --> 08:51.499
Have I reported something untrue?

08:51.501 --> 08:54.769
Because if I have, I'll
issue a retraction immediately.

08:57.373 --> 08:59.073
Oh, good.

08:59.075 --> 09:00.942
Accuracy is extremely important to me.

09:00.944 --> 09:02.410
Surely an

09:02.412 --> 09:04.279
intrepid journalist, such as yourself,

09:04.281 --> 09:05.914
wants the real story.

09:05.916 --> 09:08.716
If you stop your reports,
that's what we'll give you.

09:08.718 --> 09:11.819
An exclusive sit-down
interview with the two of us.

09:11.821 --> 09:13.321
(clicks tongue)

09:13.323 --> 09:14.589
Pass.

09:14.591 --> 09:15.990
It's nothing personal.

09:15.992 --> 09:17.025
There's just no

09:17.027 --> 09:18.960
controlled, PR-approved version

09:18.962 --> 09:20.795
of an interview that can trump

09:20.797 --> 09:22.597
what I'm getting from my inside source.

09:22.599 --> 09:23.598
You're tormenting

09:23.600 --> 09:24.899
a family that has been

09:24.901 --> 09:26.301
deeply traumatized.

09:26.303 --> 09:29.037
You want to talk about
traumatized families?

09:29.039 --> 09:31.105
Your husband killed six people.

09:31.107 --> 09:33.541
He brought this scrutiny on you, not me.

09:33.543 --> 09:36.110
So, I'm gonna keep doing my job,

09:36.112 --> 09:39.013
and the more you harass
me for it, the less inclined

09:39.015 --> 09:40.481
I'm gonna be to hold back.

09:42.418 --> 09:43.885
And I have been holding back.

09:46.322 --> 09:48.222
(sighs)

09:50.826 --> 09:52.260
I hope your grandson's

09:52.262 --> 09:54.662
doing well at his
camp for troubled children.

09:56.532 --> 09:59.100
(scoffs)

09:59.102 --> 10:01.469
I have to get out of here.

10:02.304 --> 10:03.371
Uh, you just need

10:03.373 --> 10:04.472
to get used to it is all.

10:04.474 --> 10:06.341
These people are nuts.

10:06.343 --> 10:07.508
I don't care how mad you are,

10:07.510 --> 10:09.611
you can't pee on the other campers.

10:09.613 --> 10:12.013
Just try and enjoy the nature.

10:12.015 --> 10:13.722
Yeah, I am.

10:13.859 --> 10:15.984
You're actually pretty
close to where I used to live.

10:15.986 --> 10:17.085
Oh, yeah?

10:17.087 --> 10:18.920
Yeah. It's at the southwest

10:18.922 --> 10:19.988
tip of the lake.

10:19.990 --> 10:21.055
You might even be able

10:21.057 --> 10:22.390
to see it from your camp.

10:22.392 --> 10:25.059
Sometimes when the sun sets, you can

10:25.061 --> 10:26.561
see it reflecting off the green tarp

10:26.563 --> 10:27.729
on the roof.

10:27.731 --> 10:30.231
I have to go now, Uncle Garrett.

10:36.038 --> 10:37.872
I'm Sadie.

10:37.874 --> 10:40.775
Jack.

10:43.112 --> 10:45.279
(sighs)

10:45.281 --> 10:47.582
Well, that went nowhere.

10:47.584 --> 10:49.150
All we did was poke the bear.

10:49.152 --> 10:51.786
It's only gonna get worse.

10:51.788 --> 10:53.621
Tell you what... I'll help you.

10:53.623 --> 10:56.424
You will?

10:56.426 --> 10:58.359
How?

11:01.530 --> 11:04.132
We'll find her source.

11:06.201 --> 11:07.435
(Cam grunts)

11:07.437 --> 11:09.404
(laughs)

11:09.406 --> 11:11.706
Just try. Try me.

11:11.708 --> 11:13.975
(both grunting)

11:13.977 --> 11:15.176
(laughs)

11:15.178 --> 11:16.778
(chuckles)

11:16.780 --> 11:18.179
Oh!

11:18.181 --> 11:19.747
The streak continues.

11:19.749 --> 11:22.183
Oh! We were just, uh,

11:22.185 --> 11:23.951
This is April. April, this is...

11:23.953 --> 11:25.186
Sophie.

11:25.188 --> 11:26.788
Hey, good to meet you.

11:26.790 --> 11:29.023
I'll just leave the table for you guys.

11:29.025 --> 11:31.392
Go for his left edge.
It's always wide open.

11:31.394 --> 11:33.995
It's not my game.

11:38.567 --> 11:39.901
How you doing?

11:39.903 --> 11:42.503
I'm all right. And you?

11:44.339 --> 11:45.940
Hey, I was thinking of
something I want to do

11:45.942 --> 11:47.575
when I get out of here.

11:47.577 --> 11:50.311
Move into that place down the cape?

11:50.313 --> 11:52.213
Write a graphic novel, you know?

11:52.215 --> 11:54.615
Give Roger a bigger
world to hop around in.

11:54.617 --> 11:56.684
New people,

11:56.686 --> 11:58.252
new places... What do you think?

11:58.254 --> 12:01.089
I think it's a great idea.

12:01.091 --> 12:04.092
Yeah, I can't take total credit for it.

12:04.094 --> 12:05.960
That counselor suggest it?

12:05.962 --> 12:07.962
The nurse.

12:09.765 --> 12:11.065
Well, I-I got to say

12:11.067 --> 12:12.934
it seems like you're really getting

12:12.936 --> 12:14.368
the support you need in here.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.905
I mean, three days
in, and you look well.

12:17.907 --> 12:19.507
You know?

12:19.509 --> 12:20.708
Clear. (chuckles)

12:20.710 --> 12:22.977
(chuckles)

12:22.979 --> 12:25.546
I like it.

12:28.050 --> 12:29.751
Maybe I should give it a whirl.

12:29.753 --> 12:31.619
Getting clean.

12:33.989 --> 12:35.356
Really?

12:35.358 --> 12:36.824
Yeah.

12:36.826 --> 12:40.895
I mean, you and Jack
are both off in rehab.

12:40.897 --> 12:42.797
(chuckles)

12:42.799 --> 12:43.863
I feel left out.

12:48.719 --> 12:50.838
I thought you said that it
was a racket engineered...

12:50.840 --> 12:53.541
Maybe I was wrong.

12:53.543 --> 12:56.010
(sighs)

12:56.012 --> 12:59.914
You know I'm always
game to try something new.

12:59.916 --> 13:02.016
(chuckles)

13:02.018 --> 13:05.319
I like it when we're on the same page.

13:11.326 --> 13:13.194
(chuckles)

13:25.007 --> 13:27.375
(car doors close)

13:34.383 --> 13:35.783
(pans clattering)

13:43.292 --> 13:45.393
How the hell did Mitchell Hawthorne

13:45.395 --> 13:47.862
get mixed up with this guy?

13:56.038 --> 13:58.639
Boston PD. Open up.

14:00.209 --> 14:02.109
Open the door now.

14:02.111 --> 14:03.411
(door creaks)

14:07.149 --> 14:08.850
May I help you?

14:08.852 --> 14:10.718
Detectives Ross and Cutter.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.986
Boston Police.

14:11.988 --> 14:14.622
Uh, may we come in?

14:46.426 --> 14:48.294
You should ask my permission

14:48.296 --> 14:50.396
before taking photos.

14:52.199 --> 14:55.234
Right, ma'am. My apologies.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.203
We're looking for

14:57.205 --> 14:59.038
a James Canby.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.173
That's my husband.

15:02.576 --> 15:04.310
May we speak with him?

15:04.312 --> 15:07.413
Only if you have a Ouija board.

15:07.415 --> 15:10.316
(sighs)

15:10.318 --> 15:11.951
When did he pass away?

15:11.953 --> 15:16.822
Oh... going on 27 years.

15:16.824 --> 15:21.494
Ma'am, did he own a
1985 Cadillac Fleetwood?

15:21.496 --> 15:23.129
Yes.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.365
I kept it after he died,

15:26.367 --> 15:29.802
but it was stolen from this property...

15:29.804 --> 15:33.439
oh... maybe 20 years ago.

15:33.441 --> 15:35.241
But you didn't report that as stolen.

15:35.243 --> 15:36.308
Why is that?

15:36.310 --> 15:39.445
I didn't see the point.

15:39.447 --> 15:42.214
I wasn't exactly using it.

15:44.251 --> 15:46.752
Mitchell and his
accomplice must have stolen the car.

15:46.754 --> 15:48.120
This is a dead end.

15:51.625 --> 15:56.662
Did you or your husband
know a Mitchell Hawthorne?

15:56.664 --> 15:59.298
I don't recognize that name, no.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.400
Really?

16:01.402 --> 16:03.469
He's the Silver Bells Killer.

16:03.471 --> 16:04.837
It's all over the news.

16:04.839 --> 16:08.874
As it happens, I don't read the papers.

16:08.876 --> 16:12.144
Thank you for your time, ma'am.

16:33.166 --> 16:37.069
You know you've been at
that for three minutes.

16:37.071 --> 16:39.238
Oh.

16:41.007 --> 16:45.611
Have you ever heard of MAO-A?

16:45.613 --> 16:46.812
It's a gene.

16:46.814 --> 16:48.180
People who inherit it

16:48.182 --> 16:50.816
have a greater
tendency towards violence,

16:50.818 --> 16:52.518
- (scoffs)
- aggressive behavior.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.686
Don't worry.

16:53.688 --> 16:55.254
You don't have it.

16:55.256 --> 16:57.656
But what if I...

16:57.658 --> 17:00.259
pass it on?

17:02.896 --> 17:05.564
I'm pregnant.

17:06.366 --> 17:09.300
What?

17:09.303 --> 17:11.537
You are?

17:11.539 --> 17:12.637
(chuckles)

17:12.640 --> 17:14.138
Tess, that's...

17:14.141 --> 17:16.342
That's great news, right?

17:16.344 --> 17:19.278
- It's great news.
- Right?

17:19.280 --> 17:21.446
I should be over the moon, but I'm...

17:21.449 --> 17:24.215
I'm scared.

17:24.218 --> 17:26.151
Don't you ever wonder what's in our DNA?

17:26.153 --> 17:27.720
You'll be fine.

17:27.722 --> 17:30.055
Please don't tell anyone about this.

17:30.057 --> 17:32.391
I haven't even told Brady.

17:32.393 --> 17:34.793
He doesn't seem to have time for me,

17:34.795 --> 17:36.196
much less...

17:37.686 --> 17:39.298
And I haven't heard the heartbeat.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.367
I have to go back
to the doctor to check.

17:41.369 --> 17:43.435
So if I don't hear it, I-I...

17:43.437 --> 17:45.437
When's the appointment?

17:45.439 --> 17:48.140
(sighs) 2:00 p.m. on Thursday.

17:48.142 --> 17:50.409
Okay.

17:50.411 --> 17:52.578
You want some backup?

18:00.353 --> 18:03.155
We've got to go somewhere.

18:03.157 --> 18:04.256
Go where?

18:04.258 --> 18:06.392
Anywhere.

18:06.394 --> 18:09.828
This place bums me out.

18:09.830 --> 18:12.831
My uncle Garrett has
a cabin nearby here.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.134
He told me where it was over the phone.

18:15.136 --> 18:18.237
That sounds kinda lame.

18:18.239 --> 18:20.973
He's super weird.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.441
For a while, the police suspected

18:22.443 --> 18:24.576
he was a serial killer.

18:24.578 --> 18:26.612
His girlfriend even stabbed him.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.883
You should have led with that.

18:33.420 --> 18:36.488
So, how are your,
um, withdrawal symptoms?

18:39.192 --> 18:41.393
(knocking on door)

18:42.095 --> 18:44.496
What can I do for you?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.966
Can I talk to you?

18:46.968 --> 18:49.668
I think I need your help.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.637
I always pictured a stakeout

18:51.639 --> 18:53.839
as more exciting.

18:55.075 --> 18:56.241
I mean, this is boring.

18:56.243 --> 18:58.444
Aren't you bored?

18:58.446 --> 19:01.613
I lived alone in the woods for 14 years,

19:01.615 --> 19:04.516
so for me, this is pretty exciting.

19:04.518 --> 19:05.751
Right.

19:07.220 --> 19:08.387
Come on, Jennifer.

19:08.389 --> 19:09.521
Do something.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.691
(sighs)

19:12.693 --> 19:14.226
This is Shawmut Street, right?

19:14.228 --> 19:16.862
Mm-hmm. 1600 block.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.331
Yeah. Sidewalks are cracked.

19:19.333 --> 19:22.101
I'm going to get Public
Works down here to fix them.

19:22.103 --> 19:24.870
Yeah, you're going to
make a great mayor.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.407
You think so?

19:28.409 --> 19:30.309
Oh, yeah.

19:30.311 --> 19:31.577
You are, without a doubt,

19:31.579 --> 19:32.845
the biggest pain in the ass

19:32.847 --> 19:34.013
I've ever met.

19:34.015 --> 19:36.181
(laughing)

19:41.588 --> 19:43.122
Hey, we should go. Try something else.

19:43.124 --> 19:44.390
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.526
- We might miss something.
- No, we'll try...

19:50.730 --> 19:52.031
ALISON: Tom.

19:53.566 --> 19:55.567
Tom is the source.

20:12.068 --> 20:14.603
I, uh, got your text.

20:14.605 --> 20:16.538
- What's...
- So that's where Jennifer Windham's

20:16.540 --> 20:18.373
getting her stories?

20:18.375 --> 20:19.408
Pillow talk?

20:19.410 --> 20:20.943
No.

20:20.945 --> 20:23.912
Didn't we agree our arrangement is over?

20:23.914 --> 20:24.947
Didn't I fire Naomi?

20:24.949 --> 20:26.048
We did.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.450
And it is over.

20:28.452 --> 20:31.687
So you <i>didn't</i> sleep with Jennifer?

20:31.689 --> 20:32.788
- Ali.
- (scoffs)

20:32.790 --> 20:33.922
Honestly, Tom.

20:33.924 --> 20:35.324
A reporter?

20:35.326 --> 20:37.726
What were you thinking?

20:37.728 --> 20:39.461
Why couldn't it be a nanny or an intern

20:39.463 --> 20:41.096
- like a regular person?
- I was pissed off

20:41.098 --> 20:42.631
the day you decided to stay

20:42.633 --> 20:43.932
in the campaign after all.

20:43.934 --> 20:45.300
Revenge sex.

20:45.302 --> 20:47.102
- That's mature.
- It was one time.

20:47.104 --> 20:49.004
- It didn't mean anything.
- I saw you there today.

20:49.006 --> 20:51.606
I was trying to find information

20:51.608 --> 20:53.675
- on where she was getting her stories.
- I see.

20:53.677 --> 20:55.410
And did the kissing help?

20:55.412 --> 20:58.013
I got involved with the wrong person.

20:58.015 --> 20:59.748
I thought it was a casual fling,

20:59.750 --> 21:03.652
but... it put us at risk.

21:03.654 --> 21:06.788
So what, we're even?

21:09.049 --> 21:12.518
If this marriage has any chance at all,

21:12.520 --> 21:15.588
we need total
transparency from here on out.

21:15.590 --> 21:17.857
You're absolutely right.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.959
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:22.496 --> 21:23.997
So start talking.

21:23.999 --> 21:25.732
BRADY: It's so weird.

21:25.734 --> 21:27.900
Until this belt turned
up, the only worthwhile piece

21:27.902 --> 21:29.702
of evidence the police ever had was this

21:29.704 --> 21:31.704
ivory chip, and that never led anywhere.

21:31.706 --> 21:33.973
- You don't think that's odd?
- Mitchell and

21:33.975 --> 21:35.642
his accomplice were nearly perfect

21:35.644 --> 21:37.543
at scrubbing the murder scenes.

21:37.545 --> 21:39.479
Maybe.

21:39.481 --> 21:42.248
What are you getting at?

21:45.185 --> 21:48.688
Maybe the reason that we're
not finding any evidence

21:48.690 --> 21:50.990
is because someone doesn't want us to.

21:50.992 --> 21:53.359
I mean, we're hitting dead ends,

21:53.361 --> 21:55.328
we're being denied resources.

21:55.330 --> 21:56.763
You think that...

21:56.765 --> 21:59.132
what, there's a
conspiracy in the department?

21:59.967 --> 22:01.534
If we don't solve this case,

22:01.536 --> 22:03.269
it's on us. Why don't you take off

22:03.271 --> 22:06.539
your tin foil hat and
focus on what's in front of you.

22:06.541 --> 22:09.308
We need to get back to Hawthorne.

22:09.310 --> 22:12.945
He is the key to
finding the accomplice...

22:12.947 --> 22:16.015
and we need to comb
through every detail of his life.

22:16.017 --> 22:19.452
From here... to here.

22:20.287 --> 22:21.621
What's this?

22:21.623 --> 22:23.656
It's, uh, Mitchell Hawthorne's

22:23.658 --> 22:25.224
funeral program.

22:25.226 --> 22:26.526
You were there.

22:26.528 --> 22:27.960
No, I was late.

22:27.962 --> 22:29.696
I didn't get one.

22:33.434 --> 22:37.170
That's Mitchell
Hawthorne's funeral program.

22:38.972 --> 22:41.641
So, the old blind lady lied.

22:41.643 --> 22:44.243
She did know him.

22:44.245 --> 22:46.612
So, why did you get sent to camp?

22:46.614 --> 22:49.382
I was collecting fingernails.

22:49.384 --> 22:50.650
I made a denture puppet.

22:50.652 --> 22:52.885
Plus, my mom ran over a raccoon,

22:52.887 --> 22:55.388
and I dissected it.

22:55.390 --> 22:58.491
Well, I cut off a cat's tail.

22:58.493 --> 23:01.327
A vet sewed it back on, though.

23:01.329 --> 23:03.362
Did the nerves regenerate?

23:04.364 --> 23:06.933
That's what I wondered.

23:07.801 --> 23:09.469
Look.

23:09.471 --> 23:13.439
My uncle said his cabin
had a green tarp on its roof.

23:25.819 --> 23:28.221
Your uncle lived here?

23:28.223 --> 23:30.656
He doesn't like people much.

23:30.658 --> 23:32.458
Neither do I.

23:37.664 --> 23:40.266
Except maybe you.

23:54.748 --> 23:56.949
Whoa.

24:15.369 --> 24:17.069
Here.

24:17.071 --> 24:19.305
Put this on your head.

24:19.307 --> 24:21.073
I'll shoot it off.

24:22.309 --> 24:23.910
You first.

24:23.912 --> 24:26.145
I haven't got to shoot it yet.

24:56.143 --> 24:58.644
So disappointing.

25:00.380 --> 25:01.981
Let's go back to camp.

25:10.691 --> 25:13.125
Your wife tried to get me fired.

25:13.127 --> 25:15.261
Uh-oh, what happened?

25:15.263 --> 25:16.495
She went to my

25:16.497 --> 25:19.699
supervisor and said that I...

25:19.701 --> 25:22.635
was trying to insert
myself in your professional life

25:22.637 --> 25:25.104
with an eye toward my own monetary gain.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.048
That I suggested you write a book

25:27.194 --> 25:28.484
so I could have a piece of it.

25:28.489 --> 25:30.409
(laughs) It doesn't really
matter what she said.

25:30.411 --> 25:32.311
I mean, the boss has
been at this for decades.

25:32.313 --> 25:36.916
She knows how to spot a...
user lying to get what they want.

25:36.918 --> 25:38.985
I'm sorry she did that.

25:38.987 --> 25:40.419
I'll have a talk with her.

25:40.421 --> 25:42.388
No, it's okay, it's
not really about her.

25:42.390 --> 25:44.156
It's... about you.

25:44.992 --> 25:46.592
I'm...

25:46.594 --> 25:49.028
Tell me about your
relationship with heroin.

25:49.030 --> 25:52.965
Hmm... okay.

25:52.967 --> 25:55.568
I love it.

25:55.570 --> 25:57.503
I hate it.

25:57.505 --> 25:59.672
I crave it.

25:59.674 --> 26:03.409
I resent the hold that it has on me...

26:03.411 --> 26:05.978
and I can resist its grip for awhile,

26:05.980 --> 26:09.682
and then I can't, and
when I finally give in

26:09.684 --> 26:12.251
I'm glad that I did...

26:12.253 --> 26:15.054
and then I hate myself.

26:15.056 --> 26:17.490
I mean, it's the single
best thing in the world,

26:17.492 --> 26:22.295
yet it screws up huge parts of my life.

26:22.297 --> 26:24.697
It demands all my attention.

26:25.532 --> 26:26.899
Now tell me about

26:26.901 --> 26:28.434
your relationship with Sophie.

26:30.871 --> 26:33.205
It's destructive.

26:34.808 --> 26:36.776
I crave her.

26:36.778 --> 26:38.511
She has a hold on me.

26:38.513 --> 26:41.514
Oh, I see the pattern here.

26:41.516 --> 26:43.382
Go on.

26:43.384 --> 26:47.453
Um... yeah, I mean...

26:47.455 --> 26:50.389
you know, when we make up
after a breakup I'm elated,

26:50.391 --> 26:53.459
and then... I hate myself.

26:53.461 --> 26:56.429
Bring it home.

26:56.431 --> 27:00.566
She's dynamic and incredible

27:00.568 --> 27:04.770
and doesn't care how she
screws up huge parts of my life

27:04.772 --> 27:07.740
and demands all of my attention.

27:07.742 --> 27:10.443
Cam is to heroin

27:10.445 --> 27:12.945
as Cam is to Sophie.

27:13.780 --> 27:16.182
Yeah.

27:16.184 --> 27:18.651
JENNIFER: The tendency toward
violent and aggressive behavior

27:18.653 --> 27:20.119
can be passed down.

27:20.121 --> 27:23.556
It's called MAO-A, or
the psychopath gene.

27:23.558 --> 27:25.558
I only talked to you about
this and neither of us

27:25.560 --> 27:26.559
talked to her.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.893
What is going on?

27:27.895 --> 27:29.628
But what about
those among us who already

27:29.630 --> 27:31.931
possess a predisposition to psychopathy?

27:31.933 --> 27:34.333
My source tells me
that Mitchell Hawthorne's

27:34.335 --> 27:35.768
youngest daughter, Tessa,

27:35.770 --> 27:36.936
is particularly concerned

27:36.938 --> 27:38.904
about carrying on the family line

27:38.906 --> 27:40.172
because she's pregnant.

27:40.174 --> 27:42.174
What?

27:42.176 --> 27:43.509
Is this true?

27:43.511 --> 27:47.210
Only Garrett and my
doctor knew about this.

27:47.361 --> 27:48.614
- Oh!
- I haven't told Brady.

27:48.616 --> 27:50.783
I have to reach him.

27:51.952 --> 27:53.953
Oh, please, don't go to voice mail.

27:53.955 --> 27:55.621
Where were you

27:55.623 --> 27:56.689
standing when you told me that?

27:56.691 --> 27:57.923
What?

27:57.925 --> 27:59.492
When you told me you
were pregnant, where...

27:59.494 --> 28:01.060
- You were standing here.
- Yeah.

28:03.663 --> 28:04.864
I'm so sorry

28:04.866 --> 28:05.831
I didn't tell you, Mom.

28:05.833 --> 28:06.932
It's all right.

28:06.934 --> 28:08.134
Are you okay?

28:11.138 --> 28:12.872
MADELINE: It's all right.

28:12.874 --> 28:14.840
It's all right.

28:16.376 --> 28:18.244
What are you doing?

28:24.618 --> 28:26.218
What is that?

28:26.220 --> 28:28.821
The inside source.

28:35.529 --> 28:36.929
She bugged us.

28:36.931 --> 28:38.497
How did she get in the house?

28:38.499 --> 28:41.567
I got to go call Alison.

28:49.042 --> 28:50.843
Well.

28:50.845 --> 28:53.612
Here's a chance to
practice transparency.

28:54.848 --> 28:57.883
Did you have sex with
Jennifer Windham...

28:57.885 --> 29:00.186
in my mother's kitchen?

29:05.358 --> 29:06.559
(sighs)

29:06.561 --> 29:08.727
The pantry.

29:10.097 --> 29:12.498
(scoffs)

29:12.500 --> 29:15.101
She planted a bug...

29:15.103 --> 29:16.469
while she was there.

29:16.471 --> 29:18.404
That's how she's getting her stories,

29:18.406 --> 29:20.606
straight from our mouths.

29:20.608 --> 29:23.109
Thanks to you.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.002
♪ ♪

30:03.884 --> 30:05.985
LINDA: Mrs. Canby?

30:08.288 --> 30:10.823
Mrs. Canby.

30:30.986 --> 30:33.220
Somebody realized we were closing in

30:33.222 --> 30:34.288
and shut her up.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.889
Damn.

30:35.891 --> 30:38.225
I thought this was over.

30:39.094 --> 30:40.527
(sighs)

30:40.529 --> 30:44.198
Hey, Ross, congrats on the good news.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.200
Good news?

30:46.202 --> 30:49.136
Your wife.

30:49.138 --> 30:51.105
What about my wife?

30:52.607 --> 30:54.775
(door opens and closes)

30:56.678 --> 30:58.712
There you are.

30:58.714 --> 30:59.947
I tried to reach you.

30:59.949 --> 31:01.715
You're pregnant?

31:03.585 --> 31:05.753
Tess.

31:05.755 --> 31:07.755
The lieutenant knew before I did.

31:07.757 --> 31:09.189
It's in the news.

31:09.191 --> 31:11.725
Because Jennifer
Windham bugged my mom's house.

31:11.727 --> 31:12.760
What do you mean? How?

31:12.762 --> 31:13.727
It doesn't matter.

31:13.729 --> 31:16.230
It's over now.

31:16.232 --> 31:18.599
Still, that means that you told
someone before you told me.

31:18.601 --> 31:19.600
I tried to tell you,

31:19.602 --> 31:21.602
Brady, but you've been busy.

31:21.604 --> 31:23.670
Well, try harder, Tess.

31:23.672 --> 31:25.072
Grab my attention!

31:25.074 --> 31:26.673
Okay.

31:26.675 --> 31:28.575
I don't know if I want it.

31:28.577 --> 31:30.277
What?

31:30.279 --> 31:31.779
Look at my father.

31:31.781 --> 31:33.580
Look at Jack.

31:33.582 --> 31:36.420
There is something not
right in our gene pool.

31:36.426 --> 31:37.471
I mean, what sort of
environment would we...

31:37.495 --> 31:39.153
- Oh, my God.
- ...be bringing a child into?

31:39.155 --> 31:42.689
A media circus, a
horrific family legacy,

31:42.691 --> 31:44.091
an absentee father...

31:44.093 --> 31:45.793
An absentee father?

31:45.795 --> 31:46.927
You're never here, Brady!

31:46.929 --> 31:48.228
You are never here with me.

31:48.230 --> 31:49.263
You're obsessed with work!

31:49.265 --> 31:50.931
Tess, it's just this case.

31:50.933 --> 31:52.666
SBK?!

31:52.668 --> 31:54.301
How?!

31:54.303 --> 31:55.769
It's over.

31:58.139 --> 31:59.072
It's over,

31:59.074 --> 32:01.108
- isn't it?
- (sighs)

32:04.279 --> 32:07.714
We think that your dad

32:07.716 --> 32:10.417
may have been working with someone.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.254
That's why I've been so preoccupied.

32:14.256 --> 32:17.424
It never ends.

32:22.831 --> 32:23.964
(Brady sighs)

32:23.966 --> 32:26.300
I don't know how to do this.

32:27.168 --> 32:29.069
Tess, the baby.

32:29.071 --> 32:33.707
This is the good part, you know?

32:35.143 --> 32:38.312
This is what we wanted.

32:47.789 --> 32:50.424
I'm so sorry.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.860
For sleeping with my
husband in my mother's house?

32:52.862 --> 32:55.295
Or for illegally bugging us?

32:56.931 --> 32:57.931
Both.

32:57.933 --> 33:01.835
Both, good.

33:05.673 --> 33:07.641
It's been really easy, lately,

33:07.643 --> 33:10.244
to get caught up in my own issues.

33:13.047 --> 33:14.848
Then I remember...

33:16.451 --> 33:18.452
...it could be worse.

33:18.454 --> 33:19.486
It could be someone

33:19.488 --> 33:23.156
who traffics in misery.

33:24.826 --> 33:27.327
Who revels in the misfortune of others.

33:28.396 --> 33:31.064
Feeds it.

33:31.066 --> 33:33.100
Profits from it.

33:33.102 --> 33:34.935
Whatever hurdles I have

33:34.937 --> 33:39.339
in my life, I take solace from knowing

33:39.341 --> 33:42.242
at least I'm not you.

33:42.244 --> 33:45.045
Thank you for that.

33:45.047 --> 33:49.650
Now, as for the bug...

33:49.652 --> 33:51.151
if we decide to press charges,

33:51.153 --> 33:52.953
you could face five years in prison.

33:52.955 --> 33:54.988
- Please.
- I'll keep you

33:54.990 --> 33:56.089
posted on our plans.

33:56.091 --> 33:57.257
I mean, it will really come down

33:57.259 --> 33:58.959
to what you decide to report on.

33:58.961 --> 34:01.194
I won't cover your
family anymore, I promise you.

34:01.196 --> 34:02.396
Oh, yes.

34:02.398 --> 34:04.698
You will.

34:04.700 --> 34:08.235
"The resilient family, heroically
rising from the ashes

34:08.237 --> 34:09.536
after unspeakable tragedy."

34:09.538 --> 34:11.505
That kind of thing.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.141
(laughing): I'm
really looking forward to it.

34:14.143 --> 34:16.909
There's just one more thing before I go.

34:18.179 --> 34:20.080
Take off your shirt.

34:20.081 --> 34:22.149
What?

34:23.518 --> 34:26.219
Take... off...

34:26.221 --> 34:28.589
your shirt.

35:05.259 --> 35:07.027
Put it back on.

35:27.482 --> 35:29.182
That's better.

35:39.293 --> 35:41.862
Take care.

35:45.867 --> 35:48.368
I'm going to say this without anger,

35:48.370 --> 35:51.238
without judgment.

35:53.041 --> 35:55.475
Is this some technique you learned here?

35:55.875 --> 35:58.609
- In a way.
- Mm-hmm.

36:00.646 --> 36:03.214
We're through.

36:04.083 --> 36:05.950
You and me.

36:07.886 --> 36:10.054
Over.

36:10.056 --> 36:12.557
If this is about that
thing with that April girl...

36:12.559 --> 36:15.760
No, no, no. Listen to me.

36:15.762 --> 36:18.129
This is...

36:18.131 --> 36:20.731
the entire landscape.

36:20.733 --> 36:23.901
This isn't me...

36:23.903 --> 36:25.670
accusing you

36:25.672 --> 36:28.639
or blaming you.

36:30.943 --> 36:33.044
This is me taking responsibility

36:33.046 --> 36:34.512
for my part in everything,

36:34.514 --> 36:36.681
and making a decision

36:36.683 --> 36:39.817
that I will not reverse.

36:41.553 --> 36:44.822
We always do this.

36:44.824 --> 36:46.424
We even scream

36:46.426 --> 36:47.558
and throw things,

36:47.560 --> 36:49.927
and we always, always

36:49.929 --> 36:51.129
wind up back together.

36:51.131 --> 36:53.097
Because all of the screaming

36:53.099 --> 36:55.533
and throwing things

36:55.535 --> 36:58.603
is part of our dysfunction.

36:58.605 --> 37:00.771
It fuels us.

37:01.907 --> 37:04.509
This is not what I want anymore.

37:05.511 --> 37:08.846
You are not what I want anymore.

37:12.002 --> 37:13.618
And we'll figure out the Jack thing

37:13.620 --> 37:15.786
when I'm out of here.

37:19.691 --> 37:21.826
Cam.

37:38.944 --> 37:41.546
$12,000 couch ten feet away,

37:41.548 --> 37:43.181
and you're sitting on a wooden stair.

37:43.183 --> 37:44.282
You're one to talk.

37:44.284 --> 37:45.416
You tried to sleep in the shed

37:45.418 --> 37:46.717
when you first got here.

37:46.719 --> 37:48.386
Touché.

37:48.388 --> 37:49.453
This is my spot

37:49.455 --> 37:51.088
to think.

37:51.790 --> 37:53.991
Hmm.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.601
You know you're going about

38:03.603 --> 38:07.638
this whole baby thing all wrong.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.073
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

38:09.075 --> 38:11.242
Okay.

38:12.711 --> 38:16.581
Look, maybe...

38:16.583 --> 38:20.384
Maybe the kid will have
this MAO-A gene.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.487
Maybe we all got it; I don't know,

38:23.489 --> 38:26.090
- (sighs)
- but listen to me.

38:26.092 --> 38:29.427
It's also going to have you as a mother.

38:29.429 --> 38:31.229
Okay?

38:31.231 --> 38:33.130
So now all of a
sudden you're talking about

38:33.132 --> 38:36.867
someone who's compassionate,

38:36.869 --> 38:39.770
kind, nurturing.

38:39.772 --> 38:42.006
And then you throw Brady in the mix.

38:42.008 --> 38:45.843
He's committed, moral, upstanding.

38:45.845 --> 38:49.347
So really, when you break it down,

38:49.349 --> 38:52.216
you two kind of owe it to humanity

38:52.218 --> 38:53.951
to have this baby.

38:53.953 --> 38:55.152
(laughing)

38:55.154 --> 38:57.588
No pressure.

38:58.757 --> 39:00.925
Thank you.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.799
Give it a second.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.569
There we go.

39:11.571 --> 39:12.737
(whooshing heartbeat)

39:12.739 --> 39:14.605
Now that's a healthy heartbeat.

39:14.607 --> 39:15.740
(sighs)

39:15.742 --> 39:18.309
Wave for the camera.

39:18.311 --> 39:20.845
Right there?

39:22.714 --> 39:23.948
Looks like a lima bean.

39:23.950 --> 39:27.118
(laughing)

39:27.120 --> 39:29.987
Oh. Hi, baby.

39:33.425 --> 39:35.493
(laughing): Hi.

39:37.296 --> 39:39.497
(kissing)

39:39.499 --> 39:40.765
I'll see you at 12 weeks.

39:40.767 --> 39:43.668
(chuckles)

39:43.670 --> 39:45.269
Thank you.

39:46.338 --> 39:47.772
Oh.

39:47.774 --> 39:49.774
- (Tessa chuckles)
- There it is.

39:49.776 --> 39:51.342
I want to take a picture.

39:51.344 --> 39:52.877
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:55.614 --> 39:57.682
- Oh.
- What?

39:57.684 --> 39:59.650
Jack got kicked out of camp.

39:59.652 --> 40:01.152
I have to go pick him up.

40:01.154 --> 40:03.187
What happened? (scoffs)

40:03.189 --> 40:04.689
Who knows? It's Jack.

40:04.691 --> 40:06.290
Oh, right, okay.

40:06.292 --> 40:08.025
Uh, well, I'll drive you up, yeah?

40:08.027 --> 40:09.360
No, you know what?

40:09.362 --> 40:11.562
I'd rather you stayed here and worked.

40:11.564 --> 40:13.164
I want you done with this case.

40:13.166 --> 40:15.599
I want it to be over.

40:15.601 --> 40:18.135
Me, too. So we can finally move on.

40:18.137 --> 40:22.006
Me, you...

40:22.008 --> 40:23.474
and the lima bean.

40:26.301 --> 40:28.612
JENNIFER: <i>Finally, some
good news for the Hawthornes.</i>

40:28.614 --> 40:32.116
Sources say Alison Hawthorne
- Price's mayoral campaign

40:32.118 --> 40:34.585
has been reinvigorated as
supporters rally around her.

40:34.587 --> 40:37.088
She now seems poised for a comeback.

40:37.090 --> 40:40.491
I also heard the
Hawthornes just donated $200,000

40:40.493 --> 40:42.727
to an urgent care clinic

40:42.729 --> 40:44.729
servicing low-income families.

40:44.731 --> 40:46.664
It's a testament to one family's

40:46.666 --> 40:48.299
- commitment to community...
- Finally.

40:48.301 --> 40:50.801
A bright spot.

40:50.803 --> 40:52.403
- We should relish this.
- (chuckles)

40:52.405 --> 40:55.039
...Bill Conley throughout
the campaign...

40:55.041 --> 40:56.574
Thank you.

40:56.576 --> 41:00.077
Well, it was a team effort, right?

41:00.079 --> 41:01.645
You got rid of the turtleneck.

41:01.647 --> 41:05.216
(laughs) No,

41:05.218 --> 41:07.351
we owe this to you.

41:09.354 --> 41:10.621
I want to toast

41:10.623 --> 41:12.123
my big brother.

41:15.694 --> 41:17.528
Okay, you're going straight to bed.

41:17.530 --> 41:18.896
Brush your teeth first.

41:23.869 --> 41:25.803
What happened?

41:25.805 --> 41:27.238
He was found with a knife.

41:28.039 --> 41:29.306
Did he hurt anyone?

41:29.308 --> 41:31.075
No, thank God,

41:31.077 --> 41:33.744
but the camp has a zero-tolerance
weapons policy.

41:33.746 --> 41:35.880
Obviously.

41:35.882 --> 41:37.548
(Tessa sighs)

41:53.198 --> 41:54.365
Jack!

41:54.367 --> 41:56.100
TESSA: Brady, what?

41:56.102 --> 41:58.235
- Jack!
- What?

41:58.237 --> 42:00.471
What's going on?

42:00.473 --> 42:02.106
Where'd you get this?

42:03.175 --> 42:04.909
Jack, tell me right now,

42:04.911 --> 42:06.010
where did you get this?

42:06.012 --> 42:07.845
Uncle Garrett's cabin.

42:10.582 --> 42:12.650
(phone dialing)

42:12.652 --> 42:15.252
Cutter, meet me at the precinct.

42:15.254 --> 42:17.188
I know who the accomplice is.

42:17.190 --> 42:21.392
I'm so glad you're back.

42:21.394 --> 42:22.960
To family.

42:25.263 --> 42:26.697
Family.
