WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.038
- Nothing's right
since Steve left.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.206
- Who wrote these?

00:05.239 --> 00:07.341
Did Cal write
the last three rungs?

00:07.375 --> 00:08.809
He just filed an application

00:08.842 --> 00:11.079
for tax-exempt status
with the IRS.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.147
If that goes through,
he'll be hard to stop.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.349
- I'll contact our friends
over at Internal Revenue.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.384
You're a sharp guy.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.561
It's a shame you let the Bureau

00:17.585 --> 00:19.053
keep you in the basement
for so long.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.188
- Yes, it is.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.590
- Our tax-exempt status
was denied.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.159
The money situation is critical.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.827
Fix it with the IRS.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.262
Get our exemption.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.098
Get me the money to do
what I need to do

00:30.131 --> 00:32.133
to live with everything
that you've done.

00:32.165 --> 00:35.736
- Lisa, I wanted to talk to you
about the exemption.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.739
Meyerism helped you at a very
difficult time in your life.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.109
Now the movement
needs something from you.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.077
- I can't see you anymore, Dad.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.512
- You can't see me anymore?

00:44.545 --> 00:45.755
- Eddie, what are you
doing here?

00:45.779 --> 00:48.116
- I will fucking murder you

00:48.149 --> 00:50.351
before I let you
take him from me.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.652
- Eddie, what are you doing?

00:51.685 --> 00:53.563
- They are following me.
- Who is following you?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.389
The Meyerists, the Meyerists.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.658
Now leave me the fuck alone.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.726
- Eddie! Stop!

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.865 --> 01:41.635
It was late,
1:00 a.m, 2:00 a.m.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.171
I don't remember.

01:43.204 --> 01:47.241
Ugh, I was in so much pain.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.143
The divorce.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.278
I was so angry.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.845
Like, I couldn't breathe,

01:51.879 --> 01:53.514
and just out of my mind.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.550
And I was taking these pills
that my doctor prescribed,

01:56.584 --> 01:58.186
but I shouldn't have been,

01:58.219 --> 02:01.522
not with the amount
I was drinking.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.557
Tell me what happened, Lisa.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.860
I didn't mean to.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.197
Oh, my God.

02:09.229 --> 02:12.800
What have I done?

02:12.833 --> 02:15.403
It's not easy to hear.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.804
She's in such pain.

02:16.837 --> 02:20.408
- She was, but thanks
to the process of unburdening,

02:20.441 --> 02:23.211
we were able
to assess her damage

02:23.244 --> 02:24.445
and create a map

02:24.478 --> 02:26.780
for her spiritual development
and healing.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.917
When Lisa came to us,
she was paralyzed by guilt.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.519
We gave her her life back.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.222
She wouldn't be working
at the IRS or anywhere else

02:34.255 --> 02:35.389
if it weren't for us.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.657
- But what if we're wrong

02:36.690 --> 02:38.692
about our exemption application
being her call?

02:38.726 --> 02:42.463
- She's still closer to whosever
call it is than we are.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.931
I mean, all I'm suggesting

02:43.964 --> 02:47.301
is that we remind her
what The Movement did for her

02:47.335 --> 02:48.702
and what it could do for others.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.771
- You were against
the religious status.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.574
- We don't have any money, Cal.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.977
I told the people of Clarksville
that I would test their water,

02:57.010 --> 02:59.847
and now I need the funds
to do it.

02:59.880 --> 03:00.781
I need this.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.450
It's my Offset.

03:02.483 --> 03:07.455
It has become my hope
that this will set me free,

03:07.488 --> 03:09.557
because I'm haunted, Cal.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.695
So, please, set the meeting.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.500
- Okay.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.351
- Hey.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.786
Hey, slow down.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.621
It's okay, you're in a hospital.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.622
You're safe.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.790
I'm Dr. Hollins.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.857
You can call me Sally.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.593
Can you tell me your name?

03:47.461 --> 03:48.496
Eddie.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.563
Eddie Lane.

03:49.597 --> 03:53.467
- Do you know why you're here?

03:53.501 --> 03:55.736
- I flipped out at the hotel.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.005
I hit someone.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.708
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.476
- No, no need to be sorry here.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.844
Do you know why you flipped out?

04:03.877 --> 04:09.483
- Look, I just had a rough day
with my, um...

04:09.517 --> 04:11.785
my son.

04:11.819 --> 04:15.289
And then there was this guy.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.390
He was following me.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.492
And then I guess
I drank too much.

04:18.526 --> 04:19.536
Look.
Can you take these off?

04:19.560 --> 04:22.596
- Oh, of course, of course.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.004
A guy was following you?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.543
- Um...

04:35.576 --> 04:37.911
no.

04:37.945 --> 04:41.749
No, no, I mean,
it just seemed like he was.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.385
Look, I've just been...

04:44.418 --> 04:47.054
under a lot of stress lately.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.491
- The person
who brought you in...

04:50.524 --> 04:52.793
- Uh, Chloe.

04:52.826 --> 04:56.530
- Said you spent
the last two decades in a cult.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.934
- It wasn't really a...

05:00.968 --> 05:04.838
Just the Meyerist Movement.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.507
It's more of a...

05:06.540 --> 05:11.679
- I understand reintegration
into mainstream society is hard.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.581
Perhaps we can help you
with that.

05:17.017 --> 05:21.522
Are you on any
psychiatric medications?

05:21.555 --> 05:23.624
- No.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.527
- Any history of mental illness
in your family?

05:26.560 --> 05:29.096
- No.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.432
- Your brother?

05:36.036 --> 05:39.106
My brother, um...

05:39.139 --> 05:41.742
Look, he was...

05:41.775 --> 05:43.677
He was depressed.

05:43.711 --> 05:47.881
And he committed...

05:47.915 --> 05:52.152
Look, he took his own life.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.489
But that was a long time ago.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.626
- Did the Meyerist Movement
do that to you?

05:58.659 --> 06:00.494
Mr. Lane?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.032
I was so afraid.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.468
He just appeared out of nowhere.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.169
I didn't know
what he was gonna do.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.138
- Cal Roberts?

06:11.171 --> 06:14.007
Did he explicitly threaten you?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.676
- But now he's asked me

06:15.709 --> 06:18.045
to come to the compound
to meet with them.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.012
- Them?

06:19.046 --> 06:20.514
- I don't know.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.416
That's what he said,
to come to the compound

06:22.450 --> 06:24.985
to sit down with "them."

06:25.018 --> 06:28.856
He didn't say
who "them" was, exactly.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.159
I'm terrified.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.629
They helped me
at a very hard time in my life,

06:35.663 --> 06:39.767
so I've always worn the Eye,

06:39.800 --> 06:41.802
supported The Movement.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.637
Once in a while,
I take a workshop.

06:43.671 --> 06:48.041
But I don't want anything
to do with them anymore.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.079
- I understand, Ms. Jackson.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.414
Give me a minute.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.225
They're gonna try to threaten
a federal official.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.961
- Well, Cal Roberts
is freaking out

07:07.995 --> 07:11.732
from the financial pressure.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.702
- If we can get it on tape...

07:14.735 --> 07:17.104
- That's risky.
- She hasn't been vetted.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.175
- Spoke with U.S.A. Penetti
this morning.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.645
He wants this guy shut down.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.815
Part of his mandate
to end organized crime.

07:27.848 --> 07:31.485
- Well, they're not exactly
the mafia.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.853
- Gangsters on Yoga mats.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.791
Listen.

07:37.825 --> 07:41.662
I'm concerned that Cal is gonna
run circles around this woman.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.739
- How you feeling, Agent Gaines?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.173
- I'm solid.

08:03.050 --> 08:07.988
- We've been investigating
the Meyerist Movement.

08:08.021 --> 08:12.192
Regardless of how they
may have helped you in the past,

08:12.225 --> 08:13.894
you understand
they're threatening you

08:13.927 --> 08:15.763
to get what they want,

08:15.796 --> 08:17.130
and that's illegal,

08:17.164 --> 08:19.132
and a god-awful way
to treat someone

08:19.166 --> 08:20.934
that's come to you for help.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.804
And it's probably not just you.

08:23.837 --> 08:28.709
What I'd like you to do, Lisa,
is to go in that meeting.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.711
We'll be listening.

08:30.744 --> 08:34.748
This may not look like much,
but...

08:34.782 --> 08:36.650
it's a modern listening device.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.852
You could be
a great asset to us.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.623
But I want to be crystal clear;
this is voluntary.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.124
If you want to help us,

08:44.157 --> 08:47.728
I need you to say out loud
that you're willing to do so.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.873
- I'll help you.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.218
- He wouldn't forget.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.361
- I don't know where he is, hon.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.122
He's not picking up his phone.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.591
You know,
maybe something came up.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.895
- I want to wait.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.631
- I don't know, honey.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.869
Hello?

09:28.902 --> 09:31.672
- Is this Eddie Lane's phone?

09:31.705 --> 09:33.173
You must be Sarah.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.121
Sleepwalkers.

09:48.155 --> 09:52.125
Steve used to call them pawns
on a Monopoly board.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.663
Pass Go, buy, pay, buy, pay.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.765
Once in a while,
you'd land in jail.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.870
Powerless and afraid.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.304
That's the human experience,
right?

10:04.337 --> 10:06.907
And... and sometimes
wildly happy too.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.208
Life can be fun, a party.

10:08.241 --> 10:12.813
But it's the same loop,
over and over,

10:12.846 --> 10:14.882
and endless loop to the grave,

10:14.915 --> 10:17.350
because that's what it is
out there in the I.S. world.

10:17.384 --> 10:22.389
We are taught
to be helpless and powerless.

10:22.422 --> 10:25.092
Helpless and powerless.

10:25.125 --> 10:30.297
With little pockets of fun
so we don't do ourselves in.

10:30.330 --> 10:33.433
But you,
all of you in this room,

10:33.466 --> 10:36.169
have chosen something different.

10:36.203 --> 10:40.741
You have chosen not
to be among the sleepwalkers.

10:40.774 --> 10:41.942
- Right.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.145
- You're here
because you want to say,

10:45.178 --> 10:48.281
"This is my life."

10:48.315 --> 10:50.383
You want to be awake.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.719
You don't want the fog.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.086
You want to roll the dice.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.356
And if you roll threes,
you want to move 12, right?

10:57.758 --> 11:00.694
Yeah, you want control
and clarity.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.430
You want to be the master
of your fate.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.898
And you can do it,

11:04.932 --> 11:08.068
because you have that much power
inside of you.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.104
You have The Light to use,

11:11.138 --> 11:15.242
to focus,
to shape the world around you.

11:15.275 --> 11:19.279
With it, anything is possible.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.948
And here's the best part.

11:20.981 --> 11:25.185
You already know how to do it.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.220
Mary.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.223
What color is the wall?

11:30.257 --> 11:31.324
- White.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.728
- What color
do you want it to be?

11:34.762 --> 11:36.329
You can make it
any color you want.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.966
It's your wall, Mary.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.969
The wall is right here, Mary,
not over there.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.937
If you don't focus
on what you want,

11:43.971 --> 11:45.105
you can't get it,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.240
because there is nothing
in this world

11:47.274 --> 11:49.109
that you cannot change

11:49.142 --> 11:54.181
if you bring your full force
of will against it.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.486
- Red.
- Red.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.989
- So make it so.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.124
Change it.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.393
Turn the wall red, Mary.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.128
Just turn it red.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.496
- It's red.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.898
- Hmm?

12:10.931 --> 12:11.931
Hmm?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.502
- It's green.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.104
- Green, that's great.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.105
That's great.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.139
Hawk made it green.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.307
What about you, Noa?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.274
- Yellow.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.043
- Yellow, I love it!

12:23.076 --> 12:25.078
Your wall, your life.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.413
- As blue as the sky.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.782
As blue as the sky.

12:28.816 --> 12:29.883
- Whoo!

12:29.917 --> 12:32.485
- Hey, what's up, Sean?

12:32.519 --> 12:35.055
Come on, don't miss out.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.156
What color, Sean?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.859
Come on, Sean.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.894
- Take control of your life.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.896
- You can do it.
- You got this.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.568
- You got this.
- You can do it, Sean.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.303
- You can do it, man.
- You got this.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.939
You can do it, Sean.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.247
- Red.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.548
It's red.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.170
- Where you going?

13:23.203 --> 13:24.905
- It's New York.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.074
Something's out there.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.443
You headed home?

13:30.477 --> 13:32.012
Gonna spend
the rest of your night

13:32.045 --> 13:34.848
reading The Ladder in your room?

13:34.882 --> 13:36.984
- No.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.419
- Be easy, Hawk.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.389
- Can I come with you?

13:42.422 --> 13:46.126
- Taking control
of your life, huh?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.294
- Trying.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.409
- That smell.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.212
You can't understand
how wonderful it is.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.251
- I do.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.020
It's summer to me.

14:13.987 --> 14:17.357
Has been my whole life.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.625
- But you can't appreciate it

14:18.658 --> 14:20.527
until you've been away
like I have.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.229
Someplace so cold
and forbidding,

14:22.262 --> 14:24.331
so utterly devoid of life,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.266
you can't know
how precious it is,

14:26.299 --> 14:28.035
how vulnerable.

14:31.004 --> 14:34.407
Rabbits.

14:34.441 --> 14:38.045
Shame.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.312
- If we're gonna discuss Cal,

14:39.346 --> 14:42.582
should we go somewhere
more private?

14:42.615 --> 14:47.420
- I don't think we're the ones
who should be hiding.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.222
- Cal could have written
the rungs,

14:49.256 --> 14:53.193
but I struggle to believe
he's capable of harming Steve.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.529
The man was a father to him.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.198
- We could live a thousand lives

14:58.231 --> 15:01.601
and still never find bottom
in the sea of human cruelty.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.403
- You make pronouncements
like that.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.138
You always have.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.974
But there's a human side to this

15:07.007 --> 15:08.675
which you haven't been around
to see.

15:08.708 --> 15:12.145
Accusations like this
could ruin The Movement.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.981
- The Movement
was never my thing.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.449
That's why I cut out.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.318
But I owe my life
to Steve and his work,

15:18.351 --> 15:20.087
and I will find who hurt him.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.454
- I'm aware of that.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.457
But Steve cared about
The Movement above anything,

15:24.491 --> 15:27.260
so we need to tread carefully.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.929
We need proof
before we do a thing.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.440
- Eddie.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.109
Hi.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.711
I'm Chloe.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.054
All right.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.424
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.958
You want anything?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.231
I'll be right back.

16:08.801 --> 16:13.240
- Eddie, what happened
to your face?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.308
- What, you didn't get
the report?

16:15.342 --> 16:16.576
- What report?

16:16.609 --> 16:19.112
- From the person you sent
to intimidate me.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.448
- What?

16:21.481 --> 16:26.153
- Some guy followed me
after I came to the center.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.320
Oh.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.721
I freaked out.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.024
- I don't know anything
about anyone following you.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.392
- Sure you do.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.762
It's what you guys do
over there, isn't it?

16:35.795 --> 16:39.032
I mean, I did it.

16:39.066 --> 16:42.702
- I promise you, I did not
have anyone follow you, Eddie.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.210
How long are
they keeping you here?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.448
- Till they think
I'm fit to leave, I guess.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.451
- What are they doing for you?

16:58.485 --> 17:00.787
- Just tests, meds,
I don't know yet.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.789
- They don't know
what's wrong with you.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.656
- Sarah.
- They don't know your Damage.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.127
They don't know how to help you.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.296
- Hey.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.598
- She doesn't know
how to help you.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.538
- Come back.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.673
- Sarah...

17:20.707 --> 17:22.142
- Come back home.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.378
Please.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.847
- Hey.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.083
Hey.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.469
- It's a great workshop.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.503
- Oh, thanks.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.406
Yeah.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.442
I remember
when Steve revealed it.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.609
- Mm-hmm?

17:56.643 --> 17:58.645
- My dad had just run
a number on me.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.613
We had a complicated
relationship.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.581
- Yeah.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.352
- Anyway, I was feeling so low,

18:05.385 --> 18:08.255
and Steve, he took me
into this little room,

18:08.288 --> 18:11.624
and he showed me
how to paint flowers

18:11.658 --> 18:14.494
on my walls of doom.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.763
- I wish I learned how
to do that when I was a kid.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.866
- You're doing it now.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.268
- Yeah.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.370
Yeah.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.871
Listen, I got to go catch a bus.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.639
- Yeah, yeah,
have a great evening, huh?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.741
- You too.
- All right.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.747
Oh, hey, hey.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.518
Let me get that.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.819
- You the new owner?

18:39.852 --> 18:41.388
- Cal Roberts.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.291
- True you're expanding
your homeless shelter here?

18:44.324 --> 18:45.492
- Yeah, partially.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.826
That, along with some other ways

18:46.859 --> 18:48.928
we plan to serve the borough
and the community.

18:48.961 --> 18:49.929
- Right on.

18:49.962 --> 18:50.930
When can I move in?

18:50.963 --> 18:53.933
'Cause I'm homeless now.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.203
Oh, I'm not the right kind
of homeless.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.670
- No, you're always welcome.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.673
- Yeah, right, welcome while
I'm being thrown out of my home,

19:00.707 --> 19:02.809
place I've lived at
for the last ten years.

19:02.842 --> 19:06.179
You and the rest
of your purple sneaker freaks

19:06.213 --> 19:08.248
can go fuck yourselves.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.791
- Jesus.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.580
- I know it looks like a lot,

19:40.613 --> 19:43.616
but the meds are going to help
ease the panic attacks,

19:43.650 --> 19:45.552
dysphoria, anxiety,

19:45.585 --> 19:49.289
fear you've been feeling
from the PTSD.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.424
- PTSD?

19:51.458 --> 19:53.560
- Cults work
to control your mind,

19:53.593 --> 19:56.996
and your mind has been
controlled for a long time.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.432
- Right, right, right.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.767
- I spoke with a colleague

20:00.800 --> 20:03.903
who gave me information
about a support group.

20:03.936 --> 20:08.275
It's for people who have
been victims of mind control.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.477
It might really help
to start talking to people

20:10.510 --> 20:12.879
who have been through
similar situations.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.018
You're free now, Mr. Lane.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.355
And you can have a wonderful,
productive life.

20:27.827 --> 20:28.827
- Right.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.665
- This is amazing.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.075
This is like a practically
private concert.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.635
- It is a private concert.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.741
- How did you know about this?

21:14.774 --> 21:18.445
- I know things.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.880
- My friend, she...
- She would have freaked out.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.081
She loved Andrew Bird.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.783
- Your ex-girlfriend?

21:26.919 --> 21:28.388
- Yeah.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.898
- Why did you break up
if she's so awesome?

21:29.922 --> 21:30.966
- Didn't say she was awesome.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.692
- Yeah, you did.

21:32.725 --> 21:36.095
- We just saw the world
differently.

21:36.128 --> 21:40.400
I need to be with someone
who wants what I want.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.369
- And what is it you want?

21:46.138 --> 21:49.642
- Green walls, I don't know.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.545
I'm still figuring it out.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.681
- But you still miss her
so much.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.556
- Uh, you can't do this.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.057
You're just a boy.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.559
- I'm not a boy.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.361
- I'm at least
five years older than you.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.396
- So?

22:09.429 --> 22:10.863
- So hi, boy.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.565
- Fuck you, I'm not a boy.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.936
- See you later, boy.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.479
- Where are you going?
- Shh! Come on, shut up.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.638
Breakfast starts at 6:00.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.774
We have morning gathering,

23:27.807 --> 23:30.610
but there's no pressure
to attend.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.552
Did you have Eddie followed?

23:39.586 --> 23:41.120
- Um...
- Why?

23:41.153 --> 23:43.089
- Why would you do that?
- Sarah, Sarah.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.558
He showed up here
ranting and raving.

23:45.592 --> 23:46.959
He threatened to kill me.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.628
I don't know,
he seemed out of control.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.138
And, frankly,
I was worried about you.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.565
- I can worry about myself.
- Yeah?

23:52.599 --> 23:55.835
I suppose this means
you still see him.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.537
- He's in the hospital.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.939
He was in,
I don't know, a fight.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.008
He's under
psychiatric evaluation.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.243
- Oh, Sarah, that's terrible.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.612
I'm so sorry.

24:05.645 --> 24:09.916
- It was awful
to see him that way.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.684
What happened?

24:11.718 --> 24:14.020
- Oh, no.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.622
One of the tenants...

24:15.655 --> 24:17.065
You know, I had to kick
everyone out of the building

24:17.089 --> 24:19.592
who lived here
before we bought it.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.862
Someone threw a bottle at me.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.731
You can't win.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.600
Someone always suffers.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.001
- It'll heal.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.146
- Don't do it.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.714
Lisa Jackson?

24:41.748 --> 24:43.716
It's not the way to get
the money for Clarksville.

24:43.750 --> 24:44.851
We'll find another way.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.052
- How?
- I don't know.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.520
But what you're suggesting

24:47.554 --> 24:48.831
goes against
everything we believe in.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.790
- Oh, spare me
the sanctimony, Cal.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.859
What you've done
goes way beyond...

24:52.892 --> 24:53.960
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.170
And once you start
down that road,

24:55.194 --> 24:56.228
you can't get back.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.730
- I'm already down that road!

24:57.764 --> 25:00.533
I was down it the moment
we buried Silas' body

25:00.567 --> 25:01.901
back in the ground.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.235
- But this isn't who you are.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.938
- No, you don't get
to tell me who I am.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.074
I am Co-Guardian of The Light.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.275
And I get it now,

25:09.308 --> 25:11.077
the sacrifices
that need to be made.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.779
The book needs to change.

25:12.812 --> 25:17.950
It was written a long time ago
for a small group of Devoted.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.286
Do not have Eddie
followed again.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.154
Leave him alone.

25:29.796 --> 25:30.963
- All right, Eddie, this one,

25:30.997 --> 25:33.132
you're supposed to take
with food.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.071
Eddie?

25:39.105 --> 25:42.909
Hello, Earth to Eddie.

25:42.942 --> 25:46.713
- Yeah, with food, right.

25:46.746 --> 25:50.282
- Where'd you go?

25:50.316 --> 25:53.219
- I'm just tired, Chloe.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.254
- Yeah, of course.

25:57.123 --> 26:01.060
Why don't you let me
make you some soup or something?

26:01.093 --> 26:02.194
- I'm fine.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.231
Why don't you just go on home,

26:05.264 --> 26:09.001
and I will call you tomorrow.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.637
- Okay.
- All right.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.339
Why don't you...

26:13.372 --> 26:16.609
Why don't you just take
the one for sleep, okay?

26:16.643 --> 26:19.612
The Ambien.
Please.

26:19.646 --> 26:22.114
- Honestly, I don't want
to take any of them.

26:22.148 --> 26:24.717
- Why?

26:24.751 --> 26:27.119
Because the Meyerists and Sarah
don't think that you should?

26:27.153 --> 26:29.255
- No, it's just,
I've lived all these years

26:29.288 --> 26:31.057
without needing them,

26:31.090 --> 26:35.628
and I don't think
I need them now.

26:35.662 --> 26:39.131
- Eddie...

26:39.165 --> 26:41.868
I care about you, okay?

26:41.901 --> 26:47.073
- I know you do,
and I appreciate that, okay?

26:47.106 --> 26:48.383
You've put
a great life together,

26:48.407 --> 26:50.209
and I don't want
to screw that up.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.254
- No, no, no, no, you're not...
- You're not screwing anything up.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.113
- Look, just because
you couldn't save Johnny

26:54.146 --> 26:55.190
doesn't mean that you can...

26:55.214 --> 26:56.248
- Wait. What?

26:56.282 --> 26:57.650
What are you saying?

26:57.684 --> 26:59.351
- I'm saying that maybe
you feel guilty

26:59.385 --> 27:01.253
that you couldn't
save my brother,

27:01.287 --> 27:03.923
so now you feel like
you have to try and save me.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.291
- No, Eddie, no.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.327
That is not true.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.296
Oh, God.

27:10.329 --> 27:11.798
- Yeah, you're right.

27:11.831 --> 27:15.167
You're right,
I couldn't save Johnny.

27:15.201 --> 27:19.338
I was a teenager,
and he was depressed.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.173
But Johnny never had a shot,

27:21.207 --> 27:24.076
because he wasn't brave enough
to get help.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.378
But you are.

27:26.412 --> 27:30.683
You are brave enough
to leave the Meyerists,

27:30.717 --> 27:35.021
and you're brave enough to try
to live in the real world.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.026
Eddie.

27:40.059 --> 27:44.263
I've been in therapy
for ten years, okay?

27:44.296 --> 27:48.701
I know I'm not
gonna save anybody.

27:48.735 --> 27:51.003
But I can see it in your eyes.

27:51.037 --> 27:55.407
You want to save yourself.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.909
You do.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.210
You want to save yourself,

27:58.244 --> 28:00.713
or you wouldn't even
be here right now.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.020
- Welcome, Ms. Jackson.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.055
You can just park right up here.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.857
Someone will take you
to your meeting.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.232
- Kodiak.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.534
- I was hoping we'd
cross paths this morning.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.169
- Great, good.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.438
- Can I show you something?

29:32.471 --> 29:33.973
- Yeah.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.583
- Rabbits.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.418
- Huh.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.221
He seems like a...
Like a sweet little guy.

29:49.255 --> 29:52.124
- Who's been eating
my strawberries.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.193
- Oh, yeah?

29:54.226 --> 29:56.028
- I can see it on you,

29:56.062 --> 29:58.264
the weight of leadership.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.899
It's heavy, isn't it?

30:03.435 --> 30:06.005
- Yeah.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.140
Yeah, it is.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.242
But it's not a burden.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.978
It's a blessing,

30:12.011 --> 30:15.081
to have been entrusted.

30:15.114 --> 30:19.485
- None of us is
beyond unburdening.

30:19.518 --> 30:23.355
- Yeah, that's right.

30:23.389 --> 30:26.325
That's what we teach.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.427
See you at dinner.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.376
- Shadows grow long.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.414
The night is only beginning.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.199
- Nice shirt.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.467
- Yeah, I got you one too.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.002
- Not my color.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.646
- Yeah, it's probably
not your size either.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.215
- Why you got to be like that?
- Man, you know what?

31:13.239 --> 31:14.599
Just give me the status,
all right?

31:19.411 --> 31:22.648
- I thought it might be more
productive, just the two of us.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.516
- Who the hell is that?

31:24.550 --> 31:26.385
- That's Sarah Lane.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.254
- Hmm, so it's not
just Cal Roberts.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.421
It reaches further.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.290
The whole
organization's corrupt.

31:31.323 --> 31:35.061
- Please, take a seat.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.262
- I thought Cal...

31:36.295 --> 31:38.597
- Cal's occupied.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.366
Thank you for making the trip.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.534
I know how busy you must be.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.170
You can relax.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.072
I promise you.

31:46.105 --> 31:49.241
I just wanted to personally
reach out and thank you

31:49.275 --> 31:51.243
for all of your help
with the application

31:51.277 --> 31:53.145
for tax-exempt status.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.656
I don't think we would have
ever been able

31:54.680 --> 31:57.716
to navigate the bureaucracy
without your help.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.020
So, from my heart, thank you.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.621
- She's good.
- Shut it.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.290
It was nothing, really.

32:04.323 --> 32:09.128
I'm just so sorry
I couldn't make it happen.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.130
You guys helped me so much.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.332
- I know.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.968
I remember when you
first came to us,

32:16.002 --> 32:20.272
all the damage
that you brought with you,

32:20.306 --> 32:23.709
all the suffering you felt...

32:23.742 --> 32:28.480
and that you caused others.

32:28.514 --> 32:32.318
We tried to help you
to rid yourself of it

32:32.351 --> 32:35.754
so you could be free.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.323
- All right, this is it.

32:37.356 --> 32:38.590
- We're recording.

32:38.624 --> 32:42.394
- There's so many like you
that come to us,

32:42.428 --> 32:45.264
frozen by their actions.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.999
And that is why the exemption

32:47.033 --> 32:50.236
is so very important
to us, Lisa.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.338
You understand?

32:52.371 --> 32:56.575
We want to be able to help
others like we helped you,

32:56.608 --> 33:03.049
because what you did
will never, ever go away.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.019
- No.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.272
- Come on, come on.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.439
What's going on?

33:27.473 --> 33:29.241
- What, is it working?
- Yeah.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.543
Thank you for coming in, Lisa.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.286
- What was that?

33:40.319 --> 33:42.554
- Device is no longer
transmitting.

33:42.588 --> 33:43.589
- Well, what happened?

33:43.622 --> 33:44.656
Where's the ask?

33:44.690 --> 33:46.192
- She didn't ask for anything,

33:46.225 --> 33:47.559
offer anything in return,

33:47.593 --> 33:51.230
or present a threat
to her reputation or well-being.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.435
- So we have nothing.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.748
- What do you want?
- I was just... I want...

34:10.782 --> 34:13.161
- You ever come back here again,
I'm gonna call the cops, okay?

34:13.185 --> 34:15.353
You can tell that to Cal
and everyone else.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.156
- No, no, no one sent me.

34:17.188 --> 34:19.658
I tracked you down because I
know the story of how you left,

34:19.690 --> 34:22.728
and I'm having a hard time,
and...

34:22.761 --> 34:25.664
I have no one else to talk to!

34:30.469 --> 34:32.838
It's hard to leave.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.540
Is that why you're here?

34:34.572 --> 34:35.741
Thinking about leaving?

34:35.774 --> 34:37.476
- I loved it when I came.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.279
I was...

34:40.312 --> 34:42.214
You know my sister?

34:42.248 --> 34:43.715
- Yeah, I know.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.217
- My parents, they were...

34:46.252 --> 34:48.719
It was like death
in my house all the time.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.456
I didn't want to be dead.

34:51.489 --> 34:52.424
- Yeah.

34:52.458 --> 34:57.196
- The Light, it was so alive
and so hopeful.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.865
- It is.
- It is?

34:59.898 --> 35:01.700
Then why did you leave?

35:01.733 --> 35:03.269
Did it stop feeling that way?

35:03.302 --> 35:06.138
- I just didn't like
who we were anymore.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.244
- I got married.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.312
- Ah, to Mary?

35:13.345 --> 35:15.181
- Mm-hmm, we're having a baby.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.182
- Oh, wow.

35:16.215 --> 35:19.818
- Or we were having a baby.

35:19.851 --> 35:23.622
It's just, she told me
that the baby might not be mine.

35:23.655 --> 35:28.194
And I'm freaking out,
and I'm confused,

35:28.227 --> 35:30.196
and I'm sad and mad.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.939
Because, you know,
The Light used to work for me,

35:31.963 --> 35:33.399
and now it doesn't.

35:33.432 --> 35:35.167
The other day,
we were doing this workshop,

35:35.201 --> 35:36.678
"Wakeful Life,"
it's the one where everyone

35:36.702 --> 35:38.613
is trying to change the color
of this white wall.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.671
- Yeah, I know.
- I know.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.273
- I couldn't change the wall.

35:41.307 --> 35:44.176
It was a white wall.
That's all it was.

35:46.245 --> 35:50.482
- Look.
- The wall doesn't matter.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.351
You love Mary.

35:52.384 --> 35:53.819
That's what matters.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.922
That's what you have
to ask yourself.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.258
- Yeah, I love her.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.493
All of her.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.862
- You know, if there was a way

36:03.895 --> 36:07.333
I could have stayed
in The Movement

36:07.366 --> 36:09.968
and still had my family,

36:10.001 --> 36:11.637
I would have.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.606
If there was a way

36:14.640 --> 36:17.343
we all could have just

36:17.376 --> 36:21.247
walked out together,

36:21.280 --> 36:24.316
I would have,

36:24.350 --> 36:27.386
because my family
is what mattered.

36:29.621 --> 36:33.259
But I can't have that.

36:38.464 --> 36:41.467
Maybe you can.

36:41.500 --> 36:45.404
Maybe you can have what matters.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.440
Look.
Fuck the wall.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.276
Okay?

36:50.309 --> 36:55.881
It's all about
your lives together.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.849
All right?

36:57.883 --> 37:04.290
Hey, no one can change
the color of a white wall.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.573
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.882
- You ditched me.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.585
- You found your way home.

37:33.619 --> 37:34.920
- Okay.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.955
- I just...

37:36.988 --> 37:39.691
I didn't want things
to get weird.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.927
- So you left me at a club.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.295
- Listening to great music,

37:43.329 --> 37:45.697
remembering the love
of your life.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.471
I'm in a bad mood.

37:52.504 --> 37:56.942
Everyone's about to find out
who they think I am.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.377
- How?

37:58.410 --> 38:00.346
- My mother just did
her thing that she does,

38:00.379 --> 38:01.813
her golden handcuffs,

38:01.847 --> 38:04.616
just in case I thought I could
escape and be my own person.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.585
Nope, she makes it known

38:06.618 --> 38:10.656
that I am hers
and always will be.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.558
- I don't get it.
- Yeah, you do.

38:12.591 --> 38:15.461
You can't change
who your parents are.

38:15.494 --> 38:18.430
Like, you're Sarah Lane's son,
the Guardian of The Movement.

38:18.464 --> 38:19.865
And no matter
what you do in life,

38:19.898 --> 38:21.867
to some people,
that's all you'll ever be.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.671
And to others, you will never
be able to fill those shoes.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.743
- We'll see.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.585
- I'm sorry I ditched you.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.668
- Sean?

38:56.702 --> 38:58.036
I thought you weren't...

38:58.069 --> 39:00.372
I was nervous you were
leaving me after the wall thing.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.474
And I know you're mad,
and you should be mad.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.643
You should hate me,
but I was scared...

39:08.547 --> 39:09.848
- I am mad,

39:09.881 --> 39:12.017
and I'm sad and confused
and frustrated,

39:12.050 --> 39:13.885
but I don't hate you.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.555
I want to, but I don't.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.789
You're my wife,

39:17.823 --> 39:20.058
and I am with you
if you're with me...

39:20.091 --> 39:21.760
Only me.

39:21.793 --> 39:22.761
- I'm sorry.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.130
I'm so, so sorry.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.899
But I'm so glad you came back,

39:27.933 --> 39:31.403
and that you want us
and him to be ours.

39:31.437 --> 39:33.939
- He's ours.

39:33.972 --> 39:37.409
Yours and mine.

39:37.443 --> 39:40.679
No one else's.

39:46.718 --> 39:50.055
- Hey.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.056
I saw Lisa leave.

39:51.089 --> 39:53.024
- She did.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.762
- Did you...
- No.

39:56.795 --> 40:00.932
That is a tremendous relief.

40:00.966 --> 40:05.070
I have some good news.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.573
Next time we go to San Diego,

40:07.606 --> 40:10.542
we need to stop by Los Angeles,

40:10.576 --> 40:15.514
because there is a very,
very important donor

40:15.547 --> 40:16.782
we need to talk to.

40:24.189 --> 40:26.458
Apparently, Noa,

40:26.492 --> 40:28.169
you know, the one who threw
the rock with Hawk,

40:28.193 --> 40:30.462
her mother's some sort
of music mogul.

40:30.496 --> 40:32.898
- That's great.
- It is!

40:32.931 --> 40:34.533
And it just goes to show

40:34.566 --> 40:37.836
that if we remain strong,

40:37.869 --> 40:43.709
if we remain honest and open...

40:43.742 --> 40:45.577
then The Light provides.

40:45.611 --> 40:48.079
- The Light provides.

40:50.516 --> 40:54.753
I gave Lisa Jackson
her tape back.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.021
- Okay.
- Why?

40:56.054 --> 41:00.759
- Because she's remained
loyal to us.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.028
- Loyal?

41:03.061 --> 41:05.163
- She gave me this,

41:05.196 --> 41:06.565
just in time.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.534
Tell me what happened, Lisa.

41:08.567 --> 41:11.603
I-I-I didn't mean to.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.639
Oh, my God!

41:13.672 --> 41:15.807
What have I done?

41:15.841 --> 41:17.509
What happened, Lisa?

41:17.543 --> 41:18.910
Say the words.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.779
Release them from your body,

41:20.812 --> 41:26.818
and you shall begin to be free
of their weight.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.289
I hit him!

41:31.322 --> 41:36.928
He came out of nowhere
on his scooter, and I...

41:36.962 --> 41:38.997
I hit him.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.967
I saw him when he hit
the windshield.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.003
I s-saw into his eyes.

41:45.036 --> 41:48.206
He was so young!

41:48.239 --> 41:50.642
I knew I should stop.

41:50.676 --> 41:53.645
I-I knew I should call
the police,

41:53.679 --> 41:56.548
but he was... he was just
one of those street kids,

41:56.582 --> 41:58.116
you know, like, druggie kids.

41:58.149 --> 42:02.220
And I-I had my own kids,
and I...

42:02.253 --> 42:04.656
I didn't want them
to lose a mother!

42:11.597 --> 42:14.666
- There's someone among us?

42:17.235 --> 42:19.304
Working for them?

43:49.194 --> 43:53.932
That place, those people...

43:53.965 --> 43:57.869
that was my whole life,

43:57.903 --> 44:00.071
my whole world.

44:01.940 --> 44:05.176
But I couldn't stay.

44:05.210 --> 44:08.113
I couldn't keep living
with that fear.

44:08.146 --> 44:12.784
I was so scared
every minute, every day.

44:12.818 --> 44:18.389
Then, finally, I say,
"I want to leave."

44:18.423 --> 44:21.927
And the leader...
We called him Father.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.396
Father says to me,
"You can't leave,

44:25.430 --> 44:27.465
"because even if you do,

44:27.498 --> 44:30.969
I'll come to you
in your dreams."

44:31.002 --> 44:32.270
And he did.

44:32.303 --> 44:36.975
He came to me in my dreams
every night for months.

44:37.008 --> 44:40.245
And I still dream about him.

44:40.278 --> 44:44.983
And I have to remind myself,
that's just my mind.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.819
He's not really there.

44:47.853 --> 44:51.256
No one has the power
to enter someone's dream, right?

44:51.289 --> 44:55.493
- No one has the power
to enter your dream.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.963
Thank you for sharing that,
Chelsea.

44:57.996 --> 44:59.373
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your share.

44:59.397 --> 45:01.466
- Good sharing.
- Come on in, man.

45:01.499 --> 45:04.302
Have a seat, introduce yourself
if you'd like.

45:06.805 --> 45:08.473
- Um, thanks.

45:08.506 --> 45:09.506
Um...

45:15.046 --> 45:17.515
My name is Eddie, and...

45:21.953 --> 45:23.855
I was in a cult.
