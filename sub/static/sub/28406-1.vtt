"Demons roamed in darkness
but Hongmaopi was guarded by Master Tiger."

00:42.916 --> 00:46.290
"Lantan was known as 'Hongmaopi'
in the old days."

00:46.291 --> 00:49.499
"During the reign of Koxinga,
demons plagued Lantan."

00:49.500 --> 00:51.457
"A general went back to China and"

00:51.458 --> 00:53.874
"brought Master Tiger to Taiwan
to defeat the demons."

00:53.875 --> 00:56.082
"Hence the old saying."

01:00.791 --> 01:06.624
"Lantan"

01:51.416 --> 01:52.707
So hot!

02:02.750 --> 02:04.707
Does the fish taste nice?

02:27.375 --> 02:28.874
Hung Wen-hsiung.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.165
Chun-Kai.

03:39.458 --> 03:40.582
What's up?

03:40.958 --> 03:42.290
You had a nightmare again?

03:42.541 --> 03:43.915
The monster.

03:44.541 --> 03:46.082
I dreamed of a big monster.

03:46.125 --> 03:46.999
It says...

03:47.041 --> 03:48.374
it wants to see Master Tiger.

03:49.416 --> 03:51.707
Good evening, welcome to the news program.

03:51.708 --> 03:55.249
Mysterious family murders were
found in Taiwan again.

03:55.250 --> 03:58.749
And the tragedy took place
at the victims' luxurious home.

03:58.750 --> 04:03.374
6 family members were strangled
with their heads wrapped in plastic bags.

04:03.375 --> 04:07.582
The strangest thing is that the killer
is the head of family, Hung Wen-hsiung.

04:07.583 --> 04:10.915
The neighbors express that
Hung was friendly to people.

05:55.250 --> 05:58.290
"Hsuanhu Temple, Dakeng"

05:59.000 --> 06:01.540
Scripture is burned and turned
into the rivers and the sea.

06:04.041 --> 06:06.707
Light strikes and the sky cracks.

06:08.625 --> 06:11.249
A powerful spell settles the fate of the world.

06:12.541 --> 06:14.832
An urgent order is issued to the divine guards.

06:20.125 --> 06:23.582
The Grand Pure One,
please protect me from the evil spirits.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.874
Keep my mind clear and soothe my soul.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.124
An urgent order is issued!

06:28.250 --> 06:29.332
Master Cheng.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.832
Why would God ask my son to kill people?

06:34.375 --> 06:35.790
It wasn't God.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.499
Here I bless Chen Hsin-hung, the faithful.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.749
As he is possessed by a demon,

06:44.750 --> 06:46.582
we expel the evil spirit and keep him safe

06:46.916 --> 06:49.332
before the statute of Master Tiger.

07:06.541 --> 07:07.957
He's fine.

07:07.958 --> 07:09.374
Take him home.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.499
What are you filming?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.624
We're working! What are you filming?

07:13.625 --> 07:14.915
Come, come over...

07:14.916 --> 07:16.832
We're working. What are you shooting?

07:17.041 --> 07:18.249
What did you film?

07:22.250 --> 07:24.415
We called and made an appointment yesterday.

07:25.875 --> 07:27.082
Micro Film?

07:27.333 --> 07:29.540
You called yesterday and
said you wanted to film...

07:29.541 --> 07:30.832
I know...

07:30.833 --> 07:31.832
I'm sorry.

07:31.833 --> 07:33.165
Come with me.

07:33.166 --> 07:34.874
Let me show you this. Film this. Come!

07:35.833 --> 07:39.082
Master Tiger arrived in Taiwan
about 300 years ago.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.790
Since1 669 till now.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.499
The general led our ancestors

07:45.500 --> 07:46.790
to cultivate the land in Lantan.

07:46.791 --> 07:48.707
Then they met a group of demons.

07:48.833 --> 07:49.999
So many demons.

07:50.166 --> 07:51.332
When the demons were causing trouble...

07:51.333 --> 07:53.082
Bro, shoot this! Shoot this!

07:53.416 --> 07:54.749
-What?
-Look!

07:55.833 --> 07:58.165
The demons' boss.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.790
Luckily Master Tiger killed it.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.874
That's right. He's right.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.999
Chun-Kai, come here. They are filming...

08:05.250 --> 08:06.790
It's the archdemon.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.999
The mother of all demons.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.540
So back then Master Tiger

08:11.541 --> 08:13.207
-defeated the archdemon...
-Sir!

08:13.208 --> 08:16.290
...so the settlers could settle down in peace.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.290
The same cop is here again.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.624
He's brought someone
who wants to see Master Tiger.

08:22.166 --> 08:23.540
I'll leave him to you.

08:39.166 --> 08:40.914
Master Tiger.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.664
I want to see Master Tiger.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.707
Cheng!

08:46.833 --> 08:48.999
Long time no see, mate!

08:49.666 --> 08:50.582
How are you doing?

08:50.583 --> 08:52.540
Didn't I tell you not to come to me
for things like this?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.582
I know!

08:59.125 --> 09:01.040
But, this scum insists on seeing Master Tiger.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.582
What else can I do?

09:03.875 --> 09:06.624
He killed his wife and five daughters
for no reason.

09:06.625 --> 09:09.124
It's all over the media.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.374
Everyone in Taiwan is mocking the police.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.415
Or, I wouldn't come to you.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.749
It's been a long time
since I got possessed by Master Tiger.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.332
I can't deal with serious cases.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.082
- What are you doing?
- Get down!

09:21.541 --> 09:22.999
Please, give it a try!

10:01.875 --> 10:03.499
He's possessed by a demon.

10:09.916 --> 10:10.832
Cheng.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.374
You're my only hope!

10:23.875 --> 10:25.374
How are you going to deal with it?

10:26.958 --> 10:28.499
Fry the demon.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.665
What are they talking about?

10:38.958 --> 10:41.707
They say they're going
to fry the demon tomorrow night.

10:54.541 --> 10:56.374
"General Psychiatry"

11:02.958 --> 11:04.499
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.415
You've worked very hard.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.332
Allow yourself more time.

11:11.458 --> 11:13.207
I'll go get the medicine.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.540
How are you doing?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.374
I'm okay.

11:21.250 --> 11:22.957
Take her out and spend more time with her.

11:22.958 --> 11:24.332
Shift her focus to something else.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.249
She'll be okay.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.332
Eat slowly. There is plenty.

11:43.333 --> 11:44.707
It's got into your nose!

11:44.708 --> 11:45.957
So disgusting!

11:46.250 --> 11:47.832
There is still plenty!

11:48.166 --> 11:49.624
Fatty.

11:50.208 --> 11:51.332
Give the camera to me.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.249
-Your hand is dirty!
-Look at his face!

11:54.000 --> 11:56.124
Chia-hao, time for dinner!

12:02.291 --> 12:03.665
What's that?

12:06.541 --> 12:07.915
Fatty lends it to me.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.832
We're going to take part in a competition.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.415
What competition?

12:11.416 --> 12:13.082
A Micro Film Competition.

12:18.666 --> 12:21.874
If I win, we can go on holiday abroad together!

12:23.875 --> 12:25.332
Good Luck!

12:26.125 --> 12:27.415
Go eat first.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.415
Chia-hao.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.332
Your principal called me today.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.499
What does he want?

12:38.916 --> 12:41.707
It's the 1 0th anniversary of the music class.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.040
They invite me to play in the concert.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.374
That sounds good!

12:58.291 --> 12:59.790
Chia-hao.

13:00.958 --> 13:03.082
Can you call your dad and ask him to come?

13:10.208 --> 13:12.082
Dad asks me to give you this.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.707
"Divorce Agreement"

13:19.708 --> 13:21.040
Are you sure you want to invite him?

13:23.625 --> 13:26.082
I don't want to lose face in public.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.499
-Hello.
-Hello, dad.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.624
Chia-hao.

13:42.625 --> 13:45.499
The music class 1 0th anniversary
concert in our school...

13:45.500 --> 13:46.874
Can you come?

13:47.208 --> 13:48.374
Sure.

13:48.791 --> 13:49.790
ls your mom there?

13:49.791 --> 13:51.124
I need to talk to her.

14:01.583 --> 14:02.582
Hello.

14:02.583 --> 14:03.415
Have you read it?

14:03.416 --> 14:05.290
Why did you give it to Chia-hao?

14:05.625 --> 14:07.207
Every time I sent it to you,
you said you didn't get it.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.374
What else can I do?

14:08.625 --> 14:10.915
I can't let Chia-hao stay with you anymore.

14:12.041 --> 14:13.540
He's still young!

14:13.541 --> 14:15.124
Don't drag him into this!

14:15.750 --> 14:17.915
It's because of you that I'm sick.

14:19.666 --> 14:21.249
Tell you what.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.207
You carry on with your life.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.665
But, I can't live without my son.

14:45.291 --> 14:46.499
Mei-ling.

14:47.541 --> 14:49.832
Please watch over our son and keep him safe.

14:54.125 --> 14:55.582
Bow to Mommy.

14:56.583 --> 14:57.790
Come.

15:06.833 --> 15:09.790
Daddy, I dreamed of Mommy last night.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.457
Why are you so lucky?

15:12.750 --> 15:14.624
I've never dreamed of her.

15:22.416 --> 15:25.165
Mommy says she misses us very much.

15:25.791 --> 15:29.540
She asks you not to forget
what you promised her.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.957
You really want to film it?

16:29.958 --> 16:30.707
Of course!

16:30.708 --> 16:31.874
Frying a demon!

16:32.166 --> 16:33.540
Record it, quick!

17:39.333 --> 17:41.832
Master Tiger, please come down to the Earth!

17:42.500 --> 17:44.540
Help me defeat all demons and evil spirits!

17:45.791 --> 17:47.165
An urgent order is issued!

18:02.041 --> 18:03.624
I can't film anything!

18:17.833 --> 18:19.124
Who are you?

18:19.791 --> 18:21.374
Why do you want to see Master Tiger?

19:06.583 --> 19:10.040
Master Tiger, please come down to the Earth...

19:15.625 --> 19:17.665
...crush all demons!

20:18.125 --> 20:19.624
Master...

20:21.708 --> 20:22.707
Cheng!

20:22.708 --> 20:24.415
Master Tiger failed to possess you again!

20:27.500 --> 20:28.624
Hei-gou.

20:34.291 --> 20:35.374
Move aside!

22:16.583 --> 22:17.957
Record it, quick!

22:32.333 --> 22:34.749
This is the demon fried to death just now.

23:22.166 --> 23:23.249
Water bottle.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.374
No!

23:24.625 --> 23:25.749
Come on!

23:52.791 --> 23:55.832
Chen worked so hard on his report
on the folk culture.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.332
Let's watch the film he shot.

24:02.416 --> 24:05.040
Actually, from the parapsychological
point of view,

24:05.125 --> 24:07.165
to be possessed by a spirit is rather common.

24:07.458 --> 24:09.790
If the spirit has
unfinished business on the Earth,

24:09.791 --> 24:13.624
it needs to live in a body like a parasite.

24:13.875 --> 24:17.582
The weaker the mind one has,
the easier to be possessed.

24:17.666 --> 24:18.915
What?

24:18.916 --> 24:21.374
I'm going to submit it to the competition.

24:21.375 --> 24:22.249
I'll beat you!

24:22.250 --> 24:23.915
Some will be affected by the spirit.

24:23.916 --> 24:26.457
Then they may tremble or vomit.

24:26.458 --> 24:29.790
If you let the spirit
get into your consciousness

24:29.791 --> 24:31.040
it'll control your behavior.

24:31.041 --> 24:32.707
then you're possessed.

24:32.708 --> 24:34.874
We often find

24:35.083 --> 24:36.749
animals and birds

24:36.750 --> 24:38.874
or even dolls

24:38.875 --> 24:41.124
being possessed.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.165
Daddy.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.999
It's so yummy!

24:59.708 --> 25:00.624
How is it?

25:00.625 --> 25:01.790
It should be okay.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.332
-Let me taste it.
-Okay.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.624
It's too sweet!

25:12.500 --> 25:14.040
Isn't red bean soup supposed to be sweet?

25:14.375 --> 25:15.249
I'm pregnant!

25:15.250 --> 25:16.540
I can't eat something so sweet!

25:16.875 --> 25:18.082
I'm sorry.

25:18.750 --> 25:19.790
Let me do it.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.332
Let it simmer a bit longer.

25:32.916 --> 25:34.165
My darling baby.

25:34.208 --> 25:35.874
Mommy is cooking red bean soup...

25:56.500 --> 25:57.915
This is the dream I had.

25:57.916 --> 25:59.165
A very scary dream.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.665
A monster is eating a tiger by the lake.

26:05.625 --> 26:06.915
Daddy is here.

26:07.291 --> 26:08.540
Don't be afraid.

26:47.333 --> 26:48.165
Mom.

26:48.166 --> 26:49.999
Can you see that it's tidier?

27:00.500 --> 27:02.457
You tidied it up?

27:03.291 --> 27:04.207
Well...

27:04.208 --> 27:05.915
I asked Fatty to help me.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.832
And, I even found this.

27:09.958 --> 27:11.207
What's it?

27:12.458 --> 27:14.040
A Mother's Day present.

27:14.250 --> 27:15.790
You never wear it.

27:26.291 --> 27:27.915
Do you want to keep these?

27:29.625 --> 27:31.124
What are they?

27:48.958 --> 27:50.415
No, no need to keep them.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.249
You're making a film for the competition?

27:58.708 --> 27:59.665
Yes.

27:59.666 --> 28:01.207
We're making a film about a fish.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.540
Why didn't I notice this fish before?

28:11.541 --> 28:12.790
It's new?

28:13.583 --> 28:15.040
Fatty gave it to me.

28:49.958 --> 28:51.082
Daddy!

29:23.791 --> 29:30.124
Cheng!

29:30.833 --> 29:31.540
What on earth did you do to Hung

29:31.541 --> 29:32.874
on the day you fried the demon?

29:35.708 --> 29:37.165
He's vanished into thin air!

29:38.375 --> 29:40.540
Both of the guards got possessed.

29:42.958 --> 29:45.124
If that demon is set free,

29:45.333 --> 29:47.374
I've no idea what sort of trouble he'd cause!

29:54.666 --> 29:56.249
This is Hung Wen-hsiung's house.

29:56.666 --> 29:58.332
He killed them all in here.

29:58.791 --> 30:00.915
See if you could find any clues?

30:16.583 --> 30:17.874
Phoenix is hung in the south.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.207
Trees are planted in the east.

30:21.875 --> 30:23.540
Crystals are placed in the southwest.

30:44.958 --> 30:47.082
The family looked very happy.

30:47.833 --> 30:49.957
How could Hung Wen-hsiung be so brutal?

30:55.375 --> 30:56.957
ls it really the demon's doing?

31:02.583 --> 31:04.124
They all died upstairs.

31:11.333 --> 31:12.832
In this room.

31:26.458 --> 31:27.790
What do you think?

34:56.375 --> 34:58.290
They followed
a feng shui master's instructions.

34:58.666 --> 35:00.124
The house helped them accumulate wealth

35:00.458 --> 35:02.082
but also trapped spirits inside.

35:02.875 --> 35:04.415
The whole family were strange.

35:04.958 --> 35:06.249
When his wife was being attacked,

35:06.250 --> 35:07.207
she didn't call the police.

35:07.208 --> 35:08.832
She called a feng shui master instead.

35:09.416 --> 35:10.832
Don't you think it's really strange?

35:17.625 --> 35:19.040
It's used to expel evil spirits.

35:20.166 --> 35:21.790
Hung had been followed for a while.

35:23.916 --> 35:25.457
By the demon?

35:43.916 --> 35:46.290
"Der Erlkönig by Franz Schubert"

37:43.666 --> 37:44.832
Mom.

38:03.041 --> 38:05.457
Why did you put dad's stuff back?

38:07.708 --> 38:14.165
It wasn't me!

38:23.291 --> 38:25.665
The feng shui master has retired
and moved back to the mountains.

38:26.708 --> 38:28.624
It's her great granddaughter who lives here.

38:29.125 --> 38:30.832
She's very cooperative.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.415
However, when she answers our questions,

38:33.416 --> 38:35.207
she uses so much jargon of your profession.

38:36.333 --> 38:37.832
I can't understand her.

38:44.541 --> 38:46.457
Sorry for bothering you again.

39:06.750 --> 39:09.290
My great grandmother has retired and
moved back to the mountains.

39:09.666 --> 39:11.790
None of us has managed to contact her.

39:12.208 --> 39:15.790
But I promise you that
she'd never cast any harmful spells.

39:16.625 --> 39:18.290
She often told me that

39:18.291 --> 39:19.707
some spells are better

39:21.083 --> 39:22.499
left unused.

39:23.333 --> 39:25.499
How did she help the Hung family
arrange the house?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.332
I've no idea.

39:29.750 --> 39:31.124
But,

39:31.583 --> 39:33.582
she left some papers here.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.165
Thanks.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.165
On the day the tragedy happened,

39:47.250 --> 39:49.290
Hung's wife called you.

39:49.833 --> 39:51.790
Can you describe the call to him?

40:06.541 --> 40:07.915
Hello.

40:08.458 --> 40:09.915
ls Mamu there?

40:10.125 --> 40:12.790
Mamu? She's moved back to the mountains.
She's retired.

40:13.750 --> 40:15.999
I'm Hung Wen-hsiung's wife.

40:16.250 --> 40:19.457
My husband is possessed!

40:22.958 --> 40:25.540
But, we don't run the business anymore.

40:46.291 --> 40:48.124
That's all I know.

40:49.041 --> 40:50.457
Please don't keep coming back to me.

40:51.666 --> 40:53.332
My daughter will be born soon.

40:54.375 --> 40:55.707
I'm sorry.

41:09.458 --> 41:10.874
Wait.

41:14.791 --> 41:16.582
From the fates my great grandmother wrote,

41:17.416 --> 41:19.290
did you spot any problems?

41:22.333 --> 41:24.249
There were more than
five children in the family.

41:25.041 --> 41:26.707
There should be

41:27.375 --> 41:29.332
a boy who had a very troubled fate.

41:37.041 --> 41:38.499
It's over there.

41:58.708 --> 42:00.624
Someone often brings offering here.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.665
Cheng.

43:52.583 --> 43:55.457
"Rare disease"

43:59.541 --> 44:01.457
"Medical records"

44:05.833 --> 44:10.207
"Son of Hung Wen-hsiung"

44:35.916 --> 44:37.290
Mom.

44:38.625 --> 44:41.040
I think you should go to see Dr. Yang again.

44:46.125 --> 44:47.749
Every time I see her,

44:48.958 --> 44:50.249
I feel that

44:50.250 --> 44:53.415
I'm a mad woman who can't look after you.

44:59.875 --> 45:01.040
Those things.

45:01.416 --> 45:03.165
It really wasn't me.

45:07.125 --> 45:09.165
I don't know how that happened either.

45:10.125 --> 45:11.415
Chia-hao.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.165
You have to believe Mommy.

45:14.875 --> 45:16.207
Mom.

45:16.875 --> 45:18.124
It's okay.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.499
I'll come with you.

45:20.416 --> 45:22.040
I'll always keep you company.

47:58.750 --> 48:00.124
Huang Ya-Hui.

48:46.958 --> 48:48.040
Chia-hao.

48:48.250 --> 48:49.707
Do you like the present?

48:50.958 --> 48:52.707
Auntie brought it back from Japan.

48:52.833 --> 48:53.749
Thank you, auntie.

48:53.750 --> 48:55.332
You're welcome. Glad that you like it.

48:55.625 --> 48:57.124
Auntie, your belly is so big!

48:57.125 --> 48:58.290
Bigger than mine.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.499
Of course! There is a baby inside!

49:20.208 --> 49:21.999
I haven't seen Chun-Kai for a while.

49:22.500 --> 49:24.040
He must have grown taller?

49:27.708 --> 49:29.582
If Mei-ling could see it,

49:29.916 --> 49:31.457
she'd be very happy.

49:36.333 --> 49:38.790
I know it's hard to raise a child on your own.

49:39.208 --> 49:41.624
But, you know, life goes on.

50:40.125 --> 50:41.374
Hey, ma'am!

50:41.708 --> 50:43.040
What are you doing?

50:52.500 --> 50:54.415
A-Di.

50:58.541 --> 51:00.707
I called the boy

51:00.916 --> 51:03.540
A-Di.

51:04.583 --> 51:06.624
What's your relationship with the Hung family?

51:07.708 --> 51:09.124
Why did you come here?

51:11.708 --> 51:14.457
I was the midwife

51:16.041 --> 51:18.374
when A-Di was born.

51:20.666 --> 51:26.124
He was born with a rare disease.

51:27.791 --> 51:32.790
When Mrs. Hung saw him,

51:33.208 --> 51:35.832
she didn't even dare to hold him.

51:37.208 --> 51:40.915
Mr. Hung was too proud.

51:42.708 --> 51:45.040
He was afraid of losing face

51:45.833 --> 51:48.207
so he locked the child in this room.

51:49.041 --> 51:52.540
The child had been locked up
for more than ten years.

51:55.291 --> 51:59.374
His condition never improved.

52:00.833 --> 52:04.290
Mr. Hung was getting more and more

52:04.291 --> 52:06.707
-desperate and violent.
-Sir, listen to me.

52:07.333 --> 52:08.915
- Sir.
- None of your business!

52:11.750 --> 52:12.999
Sir.

52:13.416 --> 52:15.124
Sir, listen to me!

52:15.541 --> 52:17.290
Please don't be like this, sir!

52:17.916 --> 52:19.540
You want me to lose face?

52:20.166 --> 52:21.457
How dare you!

52:22.125 --> 52:23.457
How dare you want to go out?

52:23.833 --> 52:25.332
You're a freak

52:25.833 --> 52:27.332
and you want to go out?

52:28.333 --> 52:30.290
I'm just an old woman.

52:30.750 --> 52:33.040
How could I rescue him?

52:39.666 --> 52:41.290
ls he dead?

52:42.958 --> 52:45.124
I'm not sure.

52:48.750 --> 52:50.832
I never saw him again

52:52.041 --> 52:54.957
after that evening.

53:03.750 --> 53:05.374
A-Di.

53:11.958 --> 53:13.249
Mom.

53:14.416 --> 53:16.165
Why didn't you turn the light on?

53:31.208 --> 53:32.749
Mom, what happened?

53:37.500 --> 53:38.790
Chia-hao.

53:41.625 --> 53:45.457
You're happier when
you're with dad and auntie, right?

53:54.583 --> 53:56.624
You can be honest with me.

53:56.958 --> 54:00.915
You're happier when you're with them, right?

54:03.125 --> 54:04.124
Can you stop saying that?

54:04.125 --> 54:05.499
Tell me the truth!

54:11.166 --> 54:12.082
Yes,

54:12.250 --> 54:13.832
because you're behaving like this every day!

54:13.833 --> 54:15.707
Since dad wants to divorce you,

54:15.708 --> 54:16.790
you're behaving like this every day!

54:16.791 --> 54:18.332
You're behaving like this every day!

56:30.875 --> 56:32.124
Huang Ya-Hui.

59:51.916 --> 59:53.457
This fish...

59:55.291 --> 59:57.874
I found it on the day you fried the demon.

01:00:32.416 --> 01:00:33.790
Who are you?

01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:35.874
What's your purpose?

01:00:56.541 --> 01:00:59.082
Hung Wen-hsiung is possessed.

01:01:03.791 --> 01:01:05.832
Does the fish taste nice?

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:12.582
-You monster!
-I want to go out!

01:01:12.583 --> 01:01:14.040
You're not my son!

01:02:02.166 --> 01:02:03.790
ls my mother okay now?

01:02:18.041 --> 01:02:19.540
Give me the charm.

01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:29.499
Chia-hao.

01:02:34.458 --> 01:02:36.582
Keep this charm with you.

01:02:37.208 --> 01:02:39.749
Come back to me
if anything happens to your mother.

01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:42.790
It's not an ordinary demon.

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:45.540
This is all I can do for you now.

01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:48.290
I have to go to the mountains to sort it out.

01:02:50.541 --> 01:02:52.457
Look after your mother for now.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.832
Master Tiger has descended.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.874
Listen, the boy of the Hung family.

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:16.665
If you've any request, please show yourself.

01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:19.790
Master Tiger will seek justice for you.

01:03:26.958 --> 01:03:28.707
Your humble servant is
pleading with Master Tiger

01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:31.207
to come save the innocent with us.

01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:32.957
Cheng,

01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:34.874
how did you know he was here?

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:38.499
Lantan has always been the demons' territory.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.374
A-Di was alive when he was buried.

01:03:42.916 --> 01:03:45.082
The demons used the grudge he bore

01:03:45.375 --> 01:03:47.040
to turn him into a demon.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.749
I think

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.957
they must have got other purposes.

01:03:57.708 --> 01:04:00.415
Scripture is burned and turned
into the rivers and the sea.

01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:03.332
Light strikes and the sky cracks.

01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:06.790
A powerful spell settles the fate of the world.

01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:09.165
An urgent order is issued to the divine guards!

01:04:15.583 --> 01:04:19.332
Welcome to Hsin-hsien
Elementary School concert.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:23.915
We're honored to invite an outstanding alumna,

01:04:24.041 --> 01:04:26.915
the pianist Huang Ya-Hui,

01:04:26.958 --> 01:04:28.832
to play for us as a special guest.

01:04:28.833 --> 01:04:30.457
Chia-hao, where is your dad?

01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.124
She is going to play "Der Erlkönig"
by Franz Schubert.

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:33.165
I've no idea.

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:38.374
Please give her a big hand!

01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:05.207
Help me!

01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:06.749
Help me! Quick!

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:00.665
Master!

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.124
Hei-gou, come help!

01:07:04.458 --> 01:07:05.249
I'll leave them to you!

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:06.290
Don't run around!

01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:13.124
Fierce tiger and thunder, listen to my order.

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.124
Kill the demons as an urgent order is issued!

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.790
Master, go!

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.499
Master, go! Quick! We're outnumbered!

01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:53.540
Master, go!

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:55.415
Without the help from Master Tiger,
we can't defeat them.

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:57.124
Master, go! Quick! We're outnumbered!

01:07:57.125 --> 01:07:58.790
Master, let's go! Go now!

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.082
Master, let's go! Come on!

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.249
Come on, go!

01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:06.540
Chia-hao!

01:10:08.208 --> 01:10:10.207
It's dad!

01:10:10.458 --> 01:10:11.832
What on earth happened?

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:14.124
Did you get hurt?

01:10:14.958 --> 01:10:16.082
Chia-hao!

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:47.457
Chun-Kai.

01:11:49.375 --> 01:11:50.582
What happened to you?

01:11:53.541 --> 01:11:54.832
The monster came again!

01:11:55.166 --> 01:11:56.790
It nearly got me!

01:12:15.583 --> 01:12:21.165
Anyone in?

01:12:24.666 --> 01:12:26.249
I want to see Master Tiger!

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.415
I want to save my mother!

01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:31.957
I want to see Master Tiger!

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.540
Who is it?

01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:36.874
How could you get in?

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.915
Where is Master Tiger?

01:12:44.541 --> 01:12:46.374
We receive breaking news that

01:12:46.375 --> 01:12:49.874
an accident happened

01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:51.832
at Hsin-hsien Elementary School concert.

01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:56.832
The pianist Huang Ya-Hui
disappeared after the performance.

01:12:56.833 --> 01:12:58.665
The parents express that

01:12:58.666 --> 01:13:01.332
the students shake and vomit
as if they were possessed.

01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:03.374
And, they even attack each other.

01:13:11.291 --> 01:13:12.999
Grandpa.

01:13:13.916 --> 01:13:15.249
Kai.

01:13:16.583 --> 01:13:18.165
Come, give Grandpa a hug.

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:21.207
You haven't come to see Grandpa for ages.

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:22.332
Did you miss Grandpa?

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:23.040
Yes.

01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:24.957
Grandpa missed you, too.

01:13:25.375 --> 01:13:26.540
Dad.

01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:30.332
Grandpa, daddy wants to ask you something.

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.915
What is it?

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:48.749
What happened?

01:13:51.708 --> 01:13:53.499
I need to ask Master Tiger for help.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.124
Do you remember

01:14:10.125 --> 01:14:12.207
when was the last time

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.082
you'd knelt for as long as

01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:15.957
you've been doing now?

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:21.624
It was when Chun-kai's mother
was in the hospital.

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.624
Then do you still remember

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:26.874
what I said to you?

01:14:27.541 --> 01:14:28.624
Mr. Lin.

01:14:28.625 --> 01:14:30.540
The cancer is spreading fast
in your wife's body.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:32.832
I'm very sorry.

01:14:32.833 --> 01:14:34.457
Under such circumstances,

01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:36.707
we can save either the mother

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:38.124
or the child.

01:14:38.916 --> 01:14:40.582
We hope you can make the decision
as soon as possible

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.707
or both of them will be in danger.

01:14:50.791 --> 01:14:52.124
Master Tiger.

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.040
Mei-ling is in the hospital.

01:14:54.875 --> 01:14:56.540
Please help me.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.874
Help Mei-ling recover from the illness soon.

01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:00.957
Master Tiger.

01:15:01.291 --> 01:15:10.957
Please...

01:15:11.083 --> 01:15:13.249
Please, help me, Master Tiger.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.249
Cheng,

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:03.749
what are you doing?

01:16:06.458 --> 01:16:08.249
Life and death are written in our fates.

01:16:08.666 --> 01:16:10.665
Even God cannot change it.

01:16:11.208 --> 01:16:12.499
Do you hear me?

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:14.040
Don't do this!

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:15.374
Cheng!

01:16:15.958 --> 01:16:20.832
Let go of it!

01:16:34.333 --> 01:16:36.332
If you don't let go of your obsession,

01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:41.999
it'll never work no matter
how long you kneel here.

01:16:56.416 --> 01:16:57.957
Cheng.

01:16:59.333 --> 01:17:01.957
God is with you when your mind is clear.

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:05.249
God leaves you when your mind is obsessed.

01:17:07.625 --> 01:17:09.957
Your mind is full of obsessions,

01:17:10.708 --> 01:17:12.707
how can Master Tiger enter your body?

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:17.540
The statue is made of wood.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:20.540
It just reminds us that

01:17:21.166 --> 01:17:22.999
God is with us.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.749
But, the place where God stays

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:29.415
is our hearts.

01:18:26.708 --> 01:18:28.374
Daddy, don't go!

01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:34.915
You had the nightmare again.

01:18:34.916 --> 01:18:37.499
Don't go! It's very dangerous!

01:18:46.958 --> 01:18:48.749
Daddy knows it's very dangerous.

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:51.374
But, if daddy doesn't go,

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.165
all of us will be in danger.

01:18:55.708 --> 01:18:58.207
Then, take me with you. I'll protect you.

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.582
You keep grandpa company.

01:19:17.916 --> 01:19:19.499
Daddy promises you.

01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:22.040
I'll come back.

01:19:45.416 --> 01:19:47.457
Wait...

01:19:48.333 --> 01:19:49.624
Please...

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.957
Please, take me with you to save my mother!

01:19:53.708 --> 01:19:55.874
The demon has caught my mother.

01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:58.540
She's all I have!

01:19:59.625 --> 01:20:01.499
Please, take me with you to find her!

01:20:28.625 --> 01:20:30.457
No matter what you see in there,

01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:32.207
never take the charm off your body.

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:40.040
What captured them is no ordinary demon.

01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:44.582
The situation must be controlled by
an even more evil power.

01:21:40.916 --> 01:21:44.165
Turn the mountain into the temple.

01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:47.499
Cleanse the souls as an urgent order is issued!

01:22:15.208 --> 01:22:15.915
Chia-hao, quick!

01:22:15.916 --> 01:22:17.040
Careful! Follow me closely!

01:22:22.416 --> 01:22:23.707
Chia-hao, run, quick!

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:00.790
Chia-hao...

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.624
Master Tiger, please come to me.

01:23:36.625 --> 01:23:38.707
Help me crush the demons,

01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:41.790
kill all the ghosts

01:23:42.875 --> 01:23:45.207
and disperse the evil spirits!

01:24:50.583 --> 01:24:51.915
Mom!

01:24:54.125 --> 01:24:55.707
Chia-hao...

01:25:49.125 --> 01:25:53.915
Twinkle, twinkle, little stars.

01:25:54.458 --> 01:25:59.707
How I wonder what you are!

01:26:03.916 --> 01:26:06.415
Fly up!

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.582
Little Chia-hao.

01:26:14.958 --> 01:26:20.290
Twinkle, twinkle, little stars.

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:25.999
How I wonder what you are!

01:26:26.416 --> 01:26:27.999
Close your eyes.

01:26:28.375 --> 01:26:29.999
Go to sleep, okay?

01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:32.290
Close your eyes and go to sleep, okay?

01:26:34.833 --> 01:26:41.457
Chia-hao!

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:47.540
Mommy, I forgot what it is...

01:26:47.916 --> 01:26:50.332
Come, sit. Let Mommy teach you.

01:26:50.333 --> 01:26:53.415
This is a G-clef.

01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:54.832
Do you remember how to draw it?

01:26:54.833 --> 01:26:55.582
Yes.

01:26:55.583 --> 01:26:56.582
Look.

01:26:57.041 --> 01:26:58.749
Draw a circle first and then go up.

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:01.749
Turn and go straight down.

01:27:02.041 --> 01:27:03.582
Do it again. Show me.

01:27:09.541 --> 01:27:11.249
Very good!

01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:14.832
You're so smart!

01:27:15.791 --> 01:27:17.207
Yes.

01:27:19.166 --> 01:27:21.457
You draw it very well!

01:27:36.708 --> 01:27:46.957
Mom!

01:28:25.375 --> 01:28:26.499
Chia-hao.

01:28:26.708 --> 01:28:28.165
Do you like the present?

01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:31.082
Auntie brought it back from Japan.

01:28:31.291 --> 01:28:32.249
Thank you, auntie.

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:33.915
You're welcome. Glad that you like it.

01:28:34.166 --> 01:28:36.749
Auntie, your belly is so big! Bigger than mine!

01:28:37.041 --> 01:28:39.665
Of course! There is a baby inside!

01:28:39.708 --> 01:28:42.290
Yeah, it's because there is a baby inside.

01:28:56.166 --> 01:28:57.540
Mom.

01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:05.665
Just like your dad, you don't want me, either?

01:29:11.208 --> 01:29:15.040
You're clearly happier when you're with them.

01:29:20.583 --> 01:29:22.165
No, I'm not.

01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:24.457
I was just angry at you.

01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:26.790
Angry that you ignored me.

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.165
No matter what happened,

01:29:29.333 --> 01:29:30.999
you've got me!

01:29:37.333 --> 01:29:38.999
I'm afraid that...

01:29:40.416 --> 01:29:43.540
I can't even keep you.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.915
Mom, that's not true.

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.124
Let's go home.

01:29:52.666 --> 01:29:54.665
I'll keep you company.

01:29:58.333 --> 01:30:00.790
Are you sure you want to be with me?

01:30:02.916 --> 01:30:04.499
Really?

01:30:06.291 --> 01:30:07.624
Yes!

01:30:08.625 --> 01:30:10.332
I want to be with you.

01:30:10.958 --> 01:30:12.624
Let's go home.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.499
Chia-hao.

01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:25.582
Let's stay here

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:27.540
forever and ever.

01:30:31.041 --> 01:30:32.832
Huang Ya-Hui.

01:30:36.833 --> 01:30:38.457
Mom.

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.332
I know it's you.

01:30:42.208 --> 01:30:43.749
I don't blame you.

01:30:45.375 --> 01:30:47.540
I know it's very hard for you.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:50.374
I miss you so much.

01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:53.165
Let's go home.

01:30:54.583 --> 01:30:56.499
Mom, come home with me.

01:30:57.291 --> 01:30:59.332
No matter what you've become,

01:31:00.666 --> 01:31:02.915
you'll always be my mother!

01:31:09.625 --> 01:31:11.540
Huang Ya-Hui.

01:31:35.166 --> 01:31:36.540
Chih-Cheng.

01:31:37.416 --> 01:31:39.499
Lin Chih-Cheng.

01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:13.332
Arch...

01:32:17.166 --> 01:32:18.540
Archdemon.

01:32:20.416 --> 01:32:21.624
Master Tiger.

01:32:22.041 --> 01:32:23.582
ls it the archdemon?

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:27.915
Damn!

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.374
The archdemon...

01:32:30.125 --> 01:32:31.540
Three hundred years ago

01:32:31.916 --> 01:32:33.540
it was sealed in by Master Tiger.

01:32:33.541 --> 01:32:35.874
The archdemon, the mother of all demons,
has escaped.

01:32:36.541 --> 01:32:39.457
It must be seeking revenge.

01:32:41.291 --> 01:32:42.790
It must have used Chih-Cheng

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:44.665
to trick Master Tiger
into going to the mountains.

01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:48.290
Master Tiger.

01:32:48.666 --> 01:32:50.457
Please...

01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:52.207
Please save Chih-Cheng.

01:32:52.208 --> 01:32:53.540
I beg you...

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:58.999
Chih-Cheng.

01:33:04.375 --> 01:33:06.082
I miss you so much.

01:33:28.916 --> 01:33:31.207
I don't want to stay here on my own.

01:33:31.958 --> 01:33:33.999
Don't leave me alone here.

01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:38.499
Stay with me.

01:33:40.916 --> 01:33:42.582
I miss you so much.

01:33:43.916 --> 01:33:45.790
Stay with me.

01:33:48.125 --> 01:33:52.540
Chih-Cheng.

01:33:52.958 --> 01:33:54.957
We'll never be apart.

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.915
I miss you and Chun-Kai so much.

01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:07.790
Mei-ling.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.207
Goodbye.

01:34:40.458 --> 01:34:47.457
Archdemon...

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.582
Chih-Cheng.

01:37:25.958 --> 01:37:28.415
Remember what you promised me?

01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:34.457
Look after Chun-Kai.

01:37:39.583 --> 01:37:41.374
I can't do it without you.

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.207
I can't...

01:37:47.083 --> 01:37:48.540
Promise me.

01:37:49.166 --> 01:37:50.624
Lin Chih-Cheng.

01:37:51.666 --> 01:37:53.124
You can do it.

01:37:53.625 --> 01:37:55.457
You definitely can do it.

01:37:59.125 --> 01:38:00.665
Promise me.

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:19.374
Daddy, I dreamed of Mommy last night.

01:38:26.083 --> 01:38:28.457
Then take me with you. I'll protect you.

01:38:33.250 --> 01:38:35.082
I'll come back.

01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:39.040
I promise you.

01:39:43.791 --> 01:39:46.457
Master Tiger, please come to me.

01:39:47.041 --> 01:39:48.749
Help me crush the demons,

01:39:49.333 --> 01:39:50.915
kill all the ghosts

01:39:51.458 --> 01:39:53.374
and disperse the evil spirits!

01:41:30.166 --> 01:41:31.665
Chun-Kai.

01:41:40.708 --> 01:41:42.165
Daddy!

01:42:08.375 --> 01:42:10.040
Look after grandpa.

01:42:17.791 --> 01:42:19.374
Daddy...

01:43:22.125 --> 01:43:23.457
-Sheng.
-Sir.

01:43:23.958 --> 01:43:25.374
Did you find Master Cheng?

01:43:25.375 --> 01:43:26.457
No.

01:43:31.291 --> 01:43:32.624
Keep looking.

01:43:32.625 --> 01:43:34.165
We have to find him.

01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:03.832
Ho Chih-Wei.

01:47:04.083 --> 01:47:05.415
No!

01:47:05.583 --> 01:47:06.540
What?

01:47:06.541 --> 01:47:07.915
It was a crime scene!

01:47:07.916 --> 01:47:10.832
No, you're exaggerating; it's not that bad!

01:47:22.208 --> 01:47:23.624
Ho Chih-Wei.

01:47:50.125 --> 01:47:51.457
Such a big house!

01:47:51.458 --> 01:47:52.457
Ho Chih-Wei!

01:47:52.458 --> 01:47:53.832
It's not funny. I don't like it.

01:47:53.833 --> 01:47:55.749
Okay...don't laugh.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.499
You scared me to death!

01:47:58.458 --> 01:48:00.874
Miss Shen, have you seen this room?

01:48:01.083 --> 01:48:02.415
I don't want to see it.

01:48:04.333 --> 01:48:05.249
Ho Chih-Wei.

01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:06.124
If you buy this house,

01:48:06.125 --> 01:48:07.624
I'll break up with you.

01:48:08.625 --> 01:48:09.415
Why did you say that?

01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:10.332
Okay, fine. I won't buy it.

01:48:10.333 --> 01:48:11.665
We won't break up.

01:48:13.625 --> 01:48:14.999
Then promise me one thing.

01:48:15.333 --> 01:48:16.707
What?

01:48:17.333 --> 01:48:19.124
Go hiking with my grandma.

01:48:19.625 --> 01:48:21.540
I've no energy to do that.

01:48:22.125 --> 01:48:24.332
Yes, we do!

01:48:24.708 --> 01:48:26.624
I'll give you a piggyback. Come!

01:48:27.958 --> 01:48:29.499
-Come on!
-Climb over the mountains!

01:48:29.625 --> 01:48:31.415
Come, hop up.

01:48:34.291 --> 01:48:35.332
Okay.

01:48:35.583 --> 01:48:37.040
Then which mountain are you climbing?

01:48:37.333 --> 01:48:39.082
Mt. Dakeng.

01:48:40.333 --> 01:48:41.832
ls it easy to climb?

01:48:41.833 --> 01:48:44.165
You don't have to climb it. Why asking?

01:52:15.458 --> 01:52:16.915
"Dakeng, Taichung"

01:52:16.916 --> 01:52:19.082
Second Unit, do you copy?

01:52:19.416 --> 01:52:21.707
Li Ya-ting!

01:52:21.708 --> 01:52:23.082
Second Unit.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.790
Captain Wu, what should we do now?

01:52:26.958 --> 01:52:28.332
Miss Li, please calm down.

01:52:28.333 --> 01:52:29.957
You have to trust our judgement.

01:52:30.666 --> 01:52:31.249
Hua.

01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:32.374
How far is it from here?

01:52:32.375 --> 01:52:33.915
Second Unit, do you copy? Hua?

01:52:33.916 --> 01:52:35.832
Where did they see Ya-ting?

01:52:37.625 --> 01:52:40.124
Another five kilometers
after passing this forest.

01:52:40.125 --> 01:52:42.082
Miss Li, let's find my colleagues

01:52:42.083 --> 01:52:43.832
before taking any action. It's safer this way.

01:52:43.833 --> 01:52:44.999
Okay?

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.207
Hua.

01:52:47.333 --> 01:52:48.707
Where on earth has he gone?

01:52:49.166 --> 01:52:50.540
Hua?

01:52:57.833 --> 01:52:59.665
Second Unit...

01:53:00.583 --> 01:53:02.999
Excuse me, are you on a hiking tour?

01:53:03.458 --> 01:53:05.832
Did you see a police rescue team
searching for a girl?

01:53:06.305 --> 01:53:12.388
