00:43.794 --> 00:45.712
Breaker, breaker one-nine.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.922
Smokey report. We got a bear...

00:54.054 --> 00:56.431
Breaker one-nine.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.644
Any takers. Breaker.

01:04.897 --> 01:08.735
I-40. His 20, mile marker 2-4-3.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.737
Anybody out there? Copy. Over.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.412
Hello?

01:19.496 --> 01:20.830
Lewis.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.626
No!

01:25.711 --> 01:29.422
For the first time I see myself
through somebody else's eyes.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.680
Yeah. Yeah.
It's completely claustrophobic.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.225
Big surprise.
And we're like, "Okay..."

01:41.310 --> 01:43.728
Aren't we supposed
to get a hell of a downpour?

01:43.812 --> 01:47.231
- Two hundred mile slipper-slide.
- Anybody out there?

01:47.316 --> 01:49.233
Yeah, they had a speed trap set up.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.949
No one ever said
freshman year'd go by so fast.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.951
At least Colorado has seasons.

01:59.036 --> 02:02.371
Berkeley's like summer all year.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.665
Yeah. It's late. I'm not
keeping you on the phone, am I?

02:04.750 --> 02:06.834
No. No, not at all.

02:06.919 --> 02:10.253
So, what's... You know,
what's David doing this summer?

02:10.339 --> 02:13.674
- I don't know. Who cares?
- What?

02:13.759 --> 02:16.552
Sorry. I didn't tell you before.
I just

02:16.637 --> 02:18.846
felt a little strange,
you know?

02:18.931 --> 02:21.557
You what... I don't understand.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.060
We broke up. He...

02:24.144 --> 02:28.022
He's been acting serious and weird.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.733
Serious and weird, how?
He was getting all serious and weird?

02:32.277 --> 02:35.905
I mean I told you
what he was like, and...

02:35.989 --> 02:38.282
- Wait, hold on.
- Lewis, it's 3:00 in the morning.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.284
- I got a final tomorrow.
- I'm sorry.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.037
I'll be quieter.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.752
Lewis?

02:51.171 --> 02:55.091
I'm sorry. So, what happened?

02:55.175 --> 02:59.136
He kept
looking at me, as if, you know,

02:59.221 --> 03:01.430
he totally thought
that he knew me,

03:01.515 --> 03:04.600
which he so obviously didn't.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.811
And he started crying.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.188
Which sort of sealed
the deal, you know?

03:09.273 --> 03:12.775
- You made him cry?
- I broke up with him.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.777
Wouldn't you cry?

03:14.862 --> 03:18.030
Listen, Venna,
you're cute, but you're not that cute.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.032
I was kidding.

03:20.117 --> 03:23.452
Well, I'm not
in the mood to go home.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.956
Wish I had a car, then I could

03:27.040 --> 03:28.958
just get there gradually.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.961
Decompress a little bit, you know?

03:32.045 --> 03:36.841
If you had a car, you could
stop by Colorado and pick me up.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.802
We could have an adventure.
The two of us and a windshield.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.973
- I have a car.
- No, you don't.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.350
Yeah. Didn't I tell you?

03:46.435 --> 03:48.978
- No!
- Yeah, well, like, I got one.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.869
- Sexy choice. Yeah.
- Yeah?

04:04.953 --> 04:08.164
Vintage 1971 Chrysler Newport.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.642
I've changed my plans.
I'm no longer flying back.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.852
- I bought a car, so I'm driving.
- By yourself?

04:29.937 --> 04:33.481
No. Actually, I was thinkin'
about picking up Venna.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.944
Mom?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.279
Sorry. It's... Sorry.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.448
That's great, Lewis.

04:42.532 --> 04:46.118
- What's the matter?
- Your brother just called.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.829
He was arrested again.
Drunk and disorderly.

04:48.914 --> 04:53.501
- Where, in San Diego?
- Salt Lake City.

04:53.710 --> 04:58.089
Don't worry. It's not your problem.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.342
- What did Dad say?
- You know your dad.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.344
He didn't even want
to talk to Fuller.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.222
Said if he hadn't grown up yet,
it was never going to happen.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.518
- Fuller!
- I know.

05:10.602 --> 05:14.063
I miss him, too.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.756
Listen, before
you start writing anything...

05:40.841 --> 05:44.677
- License, please. Registration.
- My brother's in jail.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.679
And I haven't seen him
in almost five years.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.558
So, I'm like driving 200 miles
out of my way just to help him out.

05:50.642 --> 05:54.395
That U-turn, it was based on
a whole, like, good deed scenario.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.189
I'm also writing you up
for a broken taillight.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.442
I have one of those?

06:03.947 --> 06:05.364
Look, I'm aware of how frustrating

06:05.449 --> 06:07.575
the prison system in this country
must be for you.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.910
Repeat offenders,
the unrehabilitated...

06:09.995 --> 06:13.831
I watch American Justice,
with your host, Bill Kurtis.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.001
But I'm different.
I'm reformed.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.129
You know, I'm strong. I'm...

06:20.213 --> 06:23.799
Officer Wilkins, this is my...
Listen, this is my pledge to you.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.468
You will not be
seeing me again.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.262
Two strikes are enough
for Fuller Thomas.

06:29.264 --> 06:29.764
Hey.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.527
You look tall. Taller than me.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.155
How's it goin'?

06:47.616 --> 06:49.617
Well, a lot better now.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.541
Kid. Hey.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.835
You came all the way
to Salt Lake just for me?

06:59.920 --> 07:03.130
Well, technically,
you are still my brother.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.094
Hey, this is my brother.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.763
I can't get...
Look at you, man!

07:10.847 --> 07:12.890
- Mr. Thomas!
- Thank you for coming.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.892
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.394
- Sign out, please.
- You're welcome.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.570
Listen, I'm supposed to
be picking up a friend.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.657
And I'm running kind of late, so...

07:29.741 --> 07:32.660
I just, well, I just wanted
to see how you're doin'

07:32.744 --> 07:34.504
and take you wherever
it was you needed to go

07:34.538 --> 07:36.330
because I sort of need
to hit the road.

07:36.414 --> 07:40.334
- Yeah, where are you goin'?
- Boulder, Colorado

07:40.418 --> 07:43.587
- and then I'm goin' home.
- Oh, perfect.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.215
- Yeah, that's great!
- Wait, what?

07:48.927 --> 07:52.096
With the exception of
the seat spring piercin' my ass,

07:52.180 --> 07:54.431
this ride's excellent.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.144
So, who's this friend
you're pickin' up?

07:58.228 --> 08:00.729
Her name is Venna. She's a friend
of mine from back home.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.524
Wait, the blinker?
That girl from the Heights?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.360
The one who was like
all day long?

08:06.444 --> 08:09.822
No, she's not like that all day.
You haven't seen her in years.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.407
Okay. You're fuckin' her?

08:15.287 --> 08:18.706
Well, what question's
more legit than that?

08:18.790 --> 08:23.460
- We're just friends, okay?
- Okay, you're not fucking her.

08:23.545 --> 08:27.214
- But you want to.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

08:27.299 --> 08:30.134
I don't?
I don't know what I'm talking about?

08:30.218 --> 08:32.344
All right, here's how it is.

08:32.429 --> 08:35.139
She's always dated guys
from the right side of the 'burbs.

08:35.222 --> 08:38.808
You were always left on the sidelines.
You get your scholarship to Berkeley.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.562
She's off to the University
of Colorado. Right?

08:41.645 --> 08:42.688
You don't understand.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.024
You guys have been talking on the phone
a lot

08:45.108 --> 08:48.903
and now she realizes that you have
the warm fuzzies for each other.

08:48.987 --> 08:53.365
You're not lettin' on, even though
you scrambled and bought this car

08:53.450 --> 08:55.075
just to pick her up.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.953
No, you're still playing
the neutered boy "friend"

08:58.038 --> 09:00.039
who's like,
always there for her

09:00.123 --> 09:02.499
because you're nice...

09:02.584 --> 09:04.877
What are you doing?

09:10.634 --> 09:13.594
So, you're still good,
or need me to drive, or...

09:13.678 --> 09:16.305
No more bullshit small talk.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.559
About me, my relationships,
or my car.

09:20.644 --> 09:22.436
Okay.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.747
No, I swear. I'm barely
slowing the car in Denver.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.151
I'll give him a seven-mile-an-hour
chance to jump and roll.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.502
You did your mom

09:46.586 --> 09:49.129
a big favor,
and she's happy now.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.591
And this time tomorrow,
you'll be here with me,

09:52.676 --> 09:54.677
and it'll be a whole new
level of stress to deal with.

09:54.761 --> 09:58.555
Okay, well, I'm gonna get goin'.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.557
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.559
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.778
Downsizing?

10:12.862 --> 10:17.825
Gas company just lets
a talented man like you go?

10:17.909 --> 10:19.827
- Just like that?
- Yep.

10:19.911 --> 10:23.622
Well, that sucks.
But this job kicks ass?

10:23.707 --> 10:26.959
Got your trailer here, and now
you're workin' kind of outside.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.961
You got a view.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.636
- What is this?
- C.B. Radio. Olive branch.

10:37.721 --> 10:41.515
- Check it out.
- You put a hole in my car.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.727
I talked him down to 40 bucks.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.230
Breaker one-nine,
breaker one-nine.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.232
We need a westbound, come on.

10:50.316 --> 10:54.028
You got Black Sheep here
ridin' front door with,

10:55.321 --> 10:57.364
Mama's Boy.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.617
We're barrelin' down on ol'
Eye-8-Eastaway, just wonderin'

11:00.702 --> 11:02.995
if you could see any bears
from your rockin' chair, over.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.665
Roger, you got a 40-mile
clear shot, 'cept for Jamestown.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.835
Got yourself a Kojak
with a Kodak at 1-8-5.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.379
All right, no cops
till Jamestown.

11:12.464 --> 11:17.092
Free to speed like a motherfucker
for like the next 40 miles or so.

11:21.556 --> 11:24.016
Aren't we supposed
to get a hell of a downpour?

11:24.100 --> 11:27.186
We got a 200-mile slipper-slide.
Come on?

11:27.270 --> 11:30.439
Doesn't matter, not from
this rocking chair.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.400
Some people like it when it rains.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.819
It's gonna rain hard tonight.

11:35.904 --> 11:40.074
- Keeps everybody inside, you know.
- What the hell's with this guy?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.117
Howdy!

11:42.202 --> 11:45.871
You got Black Sheep here,
with Mama's Boy. Who we got? Over.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.290
Could I please get a better handle
than Mama's Boy?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.001
No.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.003
Yo, Rain Man, what's your 20?

11:54.506 --> 11:58.258
- Hey, can you do a woman's voice?
- What?

11:58.343 --> 12:00.928
Do a girl. Say...

12:01.012 --> 12:04.098
"Hey, Black Sheep,
this is Miss..."

12:04.182 --> 12:07.101
- No. Forget it.
- Come on, man.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.770
You did a girl
when we pranked...

12:09.854 --> 12:13.232
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Schramm.
- Yeah.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.234
- That was good.
- No, I was nine.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.735
That was what I sounded like then.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.363
This is like a prehistoric Internet,
or something.

12:19.447 --> 12:23.117
Come on! You fuck with
someone in a chat room.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.702
- It's the same thing.
- No, forget it.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.704
Come on, man!

12:28.915 --> 12:33.418
Say, "Hey, Black Sheep,
this is Candy Cane."

12:34.921 --> 12:37.131
Just say it. You'll be amazing.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.302
Hey, Black Sheep, this is Candy Cane.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.346
I been lookin' for ya all day.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.100
That was horrible.

12:48.184 --> 12:51.186
Howdy there, Candy Cane.
This is Black Sheep.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.188
I'm right on schedule.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.190
Now, say, "I'll see ya
later on tonight, honey."

12:55.275 --> 12:56.817
Go, go, go!

12:57.777 --> 13:00.988
So I guess I'll be seein' ya
later on tonight, that right?

13:03.032 --> 13:05.784
You got it. I'm pullin' over right now

13:05.869 --> 13:08.537
and I'll see
your beautiful ass in the P.M.

13:12.083 --> 13:15.002
- So, what was that about?
- Just wait.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.504
Candy Cane, come on.

13:17.589 --> 13:21.175
I knew it!
These guys are so fuckin' horny.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.928
Get him goin'. Get him all worked up,
and then in the middle of it,

13:25.013 --> 13:28.182
say, "Hey, guess what?
I'm a dude."

13:28.308 --> 13:30.559
No way. I can't do that.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.895
Come on, man! Come on.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.105
Come on, man, it'll be fun.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.565
Come on, just do it.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.234
Do it.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.323
Hey there, who's this?

13:49.704 --> 13:52.915
- Rusty Nail.
- Nice. Nice.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.419
Well, Rusty Nail, I hope
you're doin' better than I am.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.755
Man, this drive, it seems like
it's takin' forever.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.427
- Roger that, Candy Cane.
- You got him. You got him!

14:06.930 --> 14:10.140
You know what makes it easier
sometimes, is pretendin' the person

14:10.225 --> 14:12.142
that I'm talkin' to
is right next to me.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.605
So, why don't you pretend
that I'm sittin' there with you

14:16.689 --> 14:19.816
just the two of us
and the windshield?

14:19.901 --> 14:22.361
All right.

14:22.445 --> 14:25.197
Go, go! Tell him what you look like.

14:25.281 --> 14:30.244
So, I'm 5'10", I got dirty-blond
hair down to my shoulders.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.579
I got blue eyes,
really soft skin.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.207
Man. This is turning me on.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.669
And if I were there, Rusty Nail,
you know what I'd do?

14:39.837 --> 14:42.589
- Tell me.
- Awesome!

14:42.674 --> 14:45.008
I'd make you feel good.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.344
You would?

14:47.428 --> 14:50.931
If I were there and I asked you to,
would you unbutton my blouse?

14:51.724 --> 14:52.975
Sure.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.603
Well, then I'd just
take it off, so now what?

14:56.688 --> 14:59.690
What do you want to do with me?

14:59.774 --> 15:04.486
- I've never really done this before.
- This is so classic!

15:04.570 --> 15:07.698
I'd take off your bra.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.701
Okay. You take that off.

15:14.330 --> 15:18.583
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We can't lose this guy! Go.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.627
I couldn't hear that,
Rusty Nail.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.840
Rusty Nail? Sweetheart?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.051
That was almost so good!

15:28.136 --> 15:30.762
- Damn!
- What, did we lose him?

15:30.847 --> 15:34.349
Yeah. Shit!

15:34.434 --> 15:38.186
Hey, man, you're a gifted C.B.
Prank caller when you commit to it.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.605
"I'd take off your bra."

16:02.545 --> 16:06.923
Hey. Hey, don't park
in a handicapped space.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.676
There's spaces
all over the place.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.678
Yeah, I know. That's my point.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.639
Dude, I'm gonna gimp it.
I'm not just gonna run in there.

16:14.724 --> 16:18.894
God! Just sit here.
I'll work us a deal, okay?

16:27.653 --> 16:31.490
One more goddamn maid knocks
on my door askin' about towels...

16:31.574 --> 16:33.533
Sorry, Mr. Ellinghouse.
That won't happen again.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.286
Sorry, my ass!
Where's your boss?

16:36.371 --> 16:38.830
I want the real manager.
The white one.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.541
The one whose first language
is fuckin' English?

16:41.626 --> 16:45.087
- Can you understand that?
- Hi. Could I get a room for the night?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.797
You can disturb me all you want.
I love towels.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.216
- Not done here, friend.
- I know that, amigo. I'm just...

16:49.300 --> 16:52.219
I haven't slept in two days.
You'd best not mess with me.

16:52.303 --> 16:55.097
- You just take care of your own shit.
- Peace.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.974
Tomorrow mornin',
you mark my words, asshole...

17:00.061 --> 17:03.313
a long talk with your manager.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.315
Your brown ass is gone.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.109
Fuckin' punk.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.621
What a dick.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.921
Candy Cane.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.716
Candy Cane.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.972
Hello? Candy Cane?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.978
- Did you see that fat fucking guy?
- Listen.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.647
Hello, Candy Cane. Are you there?

17:45.731 --> 17:49.985
- You are kidding me.
- Can you believe that?

17:50.987 --> 17:52.863
- Have you talked to him yet?
- No.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.615
I haven't said anything.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.703
Anybody out there
know Candy Cane? Come on.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.540
What?

18:03.624 --> 18:06.543
Tell him you want to meet up.
Tell him you want to get together.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.753
You're turnin' in for the night.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.131
You want to see him later
at the Lone Star Motel

18:11.215 --> 18:14.092
in Table Rock, Room 17.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.136
Do you just love prison so much?

18:16.220 --> 18:17.929
We're in 18.
I mean, you saw that prick, right?

18:18.014 --> 18:19.014
What, the giant?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.849
The prick is in Room 17!

18:21.976 --> 18:23.894
Nah, I can't do that.

18:23.978 --> 18:27.939
Come on! That guy sucks, okay?
He body-checked me on the way out.

18:28.024 --> 18:31.610
- Yeah, I know. I saw that.
- What? You saw that?

18:31.694 --> 18:34.863
And you're not jumping at this
extraordinary opportunity

18:34.947 --> 18:37.115
to exact some
much-deserved revenge?

18:37.200 --> 18:39.075
Are you crazy?

18:39.160 --> 18:40.535
Come on! Do it!

18:40.620 --> 18:42.537
- Calm down.
- This is amazing!

18:51.339 --> 18:53.256
Rusty Nail. Hey, there.

18:56.928 --> 19:00.222
Candy Cane. I thought I'd lost ya.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.683
Well, I guess fate
wouldn't allow that.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.269
Glad to know you're
thinkin' about me.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.898
Listen, I'm pullin'
over for the night.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.462
You wouldn't be interested in
gettin' together later, would ya?

19:13.569 --> 19:16.530
I thought you were
meeting with Black Sheep.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.910
Well, that was the plan,
but how about I blow him off

19:21.994 --> 19:24.079
and take a chance with you?

19:24.163 --> 19:27.999
- God.
- I love you, man. This is so great!

19:28.084 --> 19:29.751
Relax.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.462
But I'm not sure that
I'd be what you'd expect.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.675
Please.

19:36.759 --> 19:40.345
Well, you are a man, aren't you,
with a soul and a heart?

19:40.429 --> 19:43.640
- That's all I'd expect.
- Great.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.438
Listen, I'll be
at the Lone Star Motel

19:50.523 --> 19:53.817
in Table Rock,
if you're interested.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.694
Pink champagne.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.946
Tell him that you like
pink champagne.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.270
And if there's any way you could
bring some pink champagne,

20:03.286 --> 20:04.369
it's my favorite.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.956
That was good.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.250
What room?

20:12.712 --> 20:15.797
Room 17. Midnight.
You got that, baby?

20:17.008 --> 20:18.883
I got it.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.635
I can't wait.

20:23.639 --> 20:29.269
- That was mean.
- I know! I know! This is awesome!

20:29.353 --> 20:34.024
That guy sucks, okay? He totally
body-checked me on the way out.

20:34.108 --> 20:37.152
- All you do is put...
- Do you miss home?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.238
Yeah. I miss

20:40.323 --> 20:43.158
Mom's chocolate chip cookies.

20:44.452 --> 20:49.080
Playin' football with Dad, Sundays.

20:49.165 --> 20:53.293
Goin' to... Oh, wait. That's
somebody else's childhood.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.880
What I meant was, "No."

20:59.216 --> 21:01.217
You should call sometimes.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.219
You know, when
you don't need bail money.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.221
Yeah, but how often is that?

21:05.306 --> 21:09.267
- I'm serious.
- I call.

21:09.352 --> 21:12.145
Yeah, I know exactly what he says
every time he hangs up the phone.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.522
That I'm the world's biggest loser.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.943
That's comin' from a plumber.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.612
That's comin' from
a guy who wears

21:20.696 --> 21:25.158
a full-length lime green
jumpsuit to work every day.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.786
They don't need me.
I don't need them.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.997
It works like a charm
if you repeat it enough.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.540
Listen.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.218
Hit the TV.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.397
It's Rusty Nail! It's him!

22:02.238 --> 22:04.823
Who the hell is it?

22:04.907 --> 22:08.243
I brought the drink.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.748
This is amazing!

22:16.752 --> 22:19.754
I brought the pink champagne.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.091
Is this a goddamn joke?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.928
I swear to fucking God.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.819
What are you...
Are you Black Sheep?

22:42.903 --> 22:44.821
Why don't you come over here?

22:53.581 --> 22:56.166
Are you fuckin'
with me, standing in the dark?

22:56.250 --> 22:58.626
This prick is such an asshole!

22:58.711 --> 23:01.713
Show me your face. What was that?

23:24.153 --> 23:26.112
That was weird.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.283
Hey, you know what I think?

23:30.367 --> 23:33.036
I think someone
might have gotten hurt.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.122
No. No, we would
have heard that.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.501
We did. That was a gasp.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.419
Bet that Rusty Nail guy got hurt.

23:41.504 --> 23:45.673
No, it wasn't a gasp.
That was a laugh.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.056
Hey, where are you going?

23:54.558 --> 23:56.601
What, are you calling Mom?

23:56.685 --> 23:58.603
- Front desk.
- Hi, we just...

23:58.687 --> 24:02.607
We just heard some disturbance from
the room next door, in Room 17.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.276
"Yeah, hi, this is the drama queen
from Room 18."

24:05.361 --> 24:07.779
That's hard to say.
It was like a thud.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.447
What are you...

24:09.532 --> 24:11.991
No, we think someone
might have been hurt.

24:12.076 --> 24:16.079
And we thought you'd want
to check that out, maybe.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.122
All right. Thank you.

24:20.668 --> 24:23.086
You know what's
gonna happen now, right?

24:23.170 --> 24:25.129
Prick's gonna kill
the night manager.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.451
Hello?

24:55.536 --> 24:58.246
Guy said everything's fine.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.917
All right. Thank you.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.102
The guy said everything's fine.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.522
What'd I tell ya?

26:02.937 --> 26:05.271
- Good mornin'.
- How are you today?

26:05.356 --> 26:06.481
Pretty good. How are you?

26:06.565 --> 26:11.069
- Where are you boys from?
- Originally, New Jersey.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.280
- What are you doin' here?
- We're drivin' cross-country.

26:14.365 --> 26:17.116
- My brother... Yeah, Lewis.
- Your brother?

26:17.201 --> 26:20.078
- Where is he?
- In the room. I don't know.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.914
We had a little incident here
last night. Did you hear anything?

26:22.998 --> 26:24.916
Any sounds, or anything
out of the ordinary?

26:25.000 --> 26:29.629
Yeah, actually, next door
I heard some sounds.

26:29.713 --> 26:32.924
- Next door?
- Yeah.

26:33.008 --> 26:36.469
- Could you describe those sounds?
- Yeah, sure.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.055
They were like...

26:42.893 --> 26:43.977
No, wait.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.398
Like that.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.942
- What's goin' on?
- All right, this is Lewis.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.611
There was a "sitchy-ashun"
last night. That's all I know.

26:53.696 --> 26:56.155
So after you heard these sounds,
did you look out your window?

26:56.240 --> 26:58.282
- Did you open your door?
- No, sir.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.951
- What happened?
- After you closed your door,

27:00.035 --> 27:01.953
around 10:15 p.m.,

27:02.037 --> 27:04.414
you didn't see anybody else until
I knocked on your door this morning?

27:04.498 --> 27:08.126
That's right. Well, we did call
the night manager, because we were,

27:08.210 --> 27:10.420
concerned, right?

27:10.504 --> 27:13.464
- Right.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. He mentioned that.

27:13.549 --> 27:17.135
And he also said that one of you
had an altercation with the victim.

27:17.219 --> 27:21.264
- Which of you was that?
- Wait. The night manager said what?

27:21.348 --> 27:24.642
Apparently one of you had words
with the victim, in the motel office

27:24.727 --> 27:27.603
- when you were checkin' in?
- No, no. We never met...

27:30.190 --> 27:31.858
- What?
- Ellinghouse.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.235
Ronald Ellinghouse.
He was staying in Room 17.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.321
The huge guy? Yeah, I met him.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.647
- But he's... He's not the one...
- What happened to him?

27:41.118 --> 27:43.202
It wasn't comely.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.789
I'm sorry. I don't know
what that means.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.460
He was found early this mornin'
lyin' face down

27:50.544 --> 27:51.586
on the highway median.

27:54.131 --> 27:58.676
So, you're saying that the...

27:58.761 --> 28:00.720
The huge guy is the victim.

28:02.598 --> 28:07.643
You have no idea who might have visited
Mr. Ellinghouse's room last night?

28:09.229 --> 28:11.522
No, sir.

28:11.607 --> 28:14.525
I wish... I wish we could be
more helpful, but I...

28:14.610 --> 28:17.445
- Is he dead?
- Coma.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.157
You know what I'm thinkin'?

28:22.493 --> 28:26.412
I'm thinkin' that a little look-see
might "refreshify" your memory.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.334
Takin' a look-see at what?

28:49.311 --> 28:51.229
Ripped his jaw,

28:51.313 --> 28:53.856
clean off.

29:02.032 --> 29:04.784
That is the pain in my ass.

29:04.868 --> 29:09.247
My own personal file of ongoing shit
that I got to deal with.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.707
And now, guess what?

29:11.792 --> 29:13.709
Now, I got me another one.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.546
Mr. Ronald Ellinghouse,

29:16.630 --> 29:20.675
layin' two inches from dead
in my jurisdiction.

29:20.759 --> 29:26.097
Why? Because you sorry-ass punks
thought you'd have some fun.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.723
Fuck!

29:28.517 --> 29:31.936
I'd keep you retards in custody
if I thought it would help answer

29:32.020 --> 29:35.439
one of the hundreds
of new questions I got.

29:35.524 --> 29:39.402
But, no. All you know
is his damn C.B. Handle.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.529
And maybe he drives a truck.

29:44.074 --> 29:47.577
Do you understand the kinds
of shit I got to grapple with now

29:47.661 --> 29:50.913
because of what
you assholes did? You!

29:50.998 --> 29:53.249
You got out of jail when?

29:53.333 --> 29:54.959
Yesterday?

29:56.378 --> 30:01.257
I want you outta here.
This is like an old-fashioned western.

30:01.341 --> 30:05.469
I want you out of Wyoming
before the sun goes down.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.360
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you told them that

30:21.445 --> 30:22.862
we invited Rusty Nail back.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.989
They could have
thrown me back in jail.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.491
A man is half dead
because of what we did.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.577
Oh, bullshit.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.329
Bullshit!

30:31.413 --> 30:34.624
What, you order 10 pizzas
for your neighbor,

30:34.708 --> 30:37.960
a delivery guy gets there and
your neighbor opens up with an AK-47.

30:38.045 --> 30:41.005
- Is that your fault?
- Yeah, maybe it is.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.257
Fine.
Be the martyr all you want.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.592
No, that's not what I'm doin'.

30:44.676 --> 30:48.179
I'm trying to figure how I'm gonna
drive away after what we've done.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.849
Do what I do.

30:51.934 --> 30:55.311
Just remind yourself that
in 100 years, you're gonna be dead.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.355
It's the closest thing
I've got to a philosophy.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.759
No, you know what? I'm taking you
to Denver, and that's it.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.108
Great.

31:34.935 --> 31:38.312
Eastbound,
looking for a westbound

31:38.981 --> 31:40.731
for a bear report?

31:42.651 --> 31:46.028
Not a soul.
Never any Smokeys on that...

31:52.953 --> 31:55.288
Candy Cane...

31:56.748 --> 31:58.666
Candy Cane.

32:01.003 --> 32:03.421
- Hello.
- Hey!

32:04.381 --> 32:07.174
- Candy Cane.
- Hey!

32:07.259 --> 32:10.177
- I'm asleep.
- Hey, Candy Cane!

32:12.973 --> 32:15.016
Candy Cane?

32:17.728 --> 32:18.853
Jesus.

32:20.897 --> 32:23.983
Anybody out there know
Candy Cane?

32:25.027 --> 32:26.319
Or Mama's Boy?

32:28.113 --> 32:30.531
Baa, baa, Black Sheep.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.660
- What are you gonna say?
- Hey, Russell.

32:34.745 --> 32:37.747
This is Black Sheep. Go to 23.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.169
Hey, Black Sheep.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.674
Do you know
where I can find Candy Cane?

32:50.052 --> 32:54.138
Hey, what is your deal?

32:55.682 --> 32:57.725
I mean, seriously.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.979
I'm looking for Candy Cane.

33:05.484 --> 33:09.737
So, you've been
driving around all day

33:09.821 --> 33:11.530
looking for a voice?

33:15.035 --> 33:18.079
I think that you can
tell me where to find her.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.457
- Tell him it was a joke.
- I talked to Candy Cane

33:21.541 --> 33:24.001
about last night.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.212
And she said
that she's not interested.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.714
- No!
- She's not interested in you...

33:28.799 --> 33:33.302
- Don't do this.
- Or your pink champagne.

33:33.387 --> 33:38.057
I need to find Candy Cane.

33:39.142 --> 33:42.103
You need to find

33:42.187 --> 33:44.939
a highly-qualified psychiatrist,

33:45.023 --> 33:48.692
not a psychologist.
You're gonna need some drugs.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.528
You're gonna have to find
a damn good lawyer

33:50.612 --> 33:52.405
because the cops
are all over your ass.

33:52.489 --> 33:56.033
- Goddamn!
- Give it to me.

33:56.118 --> 33:58.869
Hey, there,
Rusty Nail, you hear this?

33:58.954 --> 34:00.996
That was me, all right? I'm a guy.

34:01.081 --> 34:06.043
It was just a joke.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.465
Apologize.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.969
- Right.
- No, just do it.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.514
- Apologize to him?
- Yeah.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.516
- I'll do it.
- No.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.271
Listen, you sick fuck,

34:25.355 --> 34:28.774
you pathetic,
lonely walkie-talkie,

34:28.859 --> 34:31.610
freak show motherfucker,
you're not getting anything from me.

34:31.695 --> 34:35.572
Know why? I have something
more powerful than your psychosis.

34:35.657 --> 34:36.866
It's called a volume knob.

34:36.949 --> 34:40.870
And the only thing I need to make you
go away is to turn it counterclockwise.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.996
Got that? You copy that?

34:44.166 --> 34:49.253
You know, Black Sheep,
you really ought to get that fixed.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.297
Get what fixed?

34:52.632 --> 34:53.882
Your taillight.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.267
- Do you see anything?
- Yeah. Cars and trucks.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.604
- Just drive. Just be cool.
- Oh, my God.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.984
- Did he follow us from the motel?
- I don't know. I don't know.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.108
- As long as we keep drivin', we're safe.
- Oh, God.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.696
- What?
- Look.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.867
- Oh, come on, come on!
- I know. But it's okay.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.161
I saw a sign. "Gas at Laramie."

35:22.245 --> 35:25.122
There'll be a phone there,
and I'll call Sheriff Ritter.

35:25.207 --> 35:26.207
Oh, good.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.211
- Laramie. That'll be good.
- We'll be all right.

35:29.377 --> 35:33.506
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.
- Okay, just stay cool.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.132
- Oh, shit!
- Keep cool.

35:35.217 --> 35:36.800
Will you stop telling me to be cool?

35:36.885 --> 35:39.595
You're makin' me like, crazy.
Get the map.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.848
- Okay. All right.
- Fuck! We're not gonna make it to Laramie.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.600
Wait, take the next exit.
I think there's a town there.

35:44.684 --> 35:45.684
- How far is it?
- I don't know.

35:45.769 --> 35:46.769
How far is it?

35:46.853 --> 35:50.314
My cuticle to my knuckle.
I don't know. Twelve miles.

35:50.398 --> 35:53.150
- We might not make it twelve miles.
- Take this exit right here.

35:59.074 --> 36:02.368
Yes! Yes, you're a genius!

36:14.923 --> 36:17.841
I'll pay, you pump. Or do you
want to pay? I don't care.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.843
- I'll pump.
- Okay. Okay.

36:52.252 --> 36:57.423
Table Rock, please. Rawlins County
Sheriff Department. Yeah.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.271
Oh, my God.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.279
Hey.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.158
Hey. Hey.

38:06.242 --> 38:09.078
Hey. Hey!

38:19.547 --> 38:21.674
Sheriff Ritter is not available.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.468
At the tone,
please record your message.

38:24.552 --> 38:25.873
When you have finished recording,

38:25.887 --> 38:30.015
you may hang up or press one
for more options.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.351
Please wait for the tone.

38:47.909 --> 38:50.661
You just got the gas?

38:50.745 --> 38:51.787
Oh, right.

38:57.252 --> 39:00.295
Come on, come on,
come on! Come on.

39:09.431 --> 39:13.183
Come on. Get in the car,
get in the car! Come on.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.812
- What?
- Go, go, go, go!

39:16.896 --> 39:18.105
- He's in there, man.
- Was that him?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.189
Did you see him?

39:19.274 --> 39:21.442
Keep driving, keep driving.

39:21.526 --> 39:24.194
Go! Yeah!

39:29.909 --> 39:31.660
Oh, my God!

39:33.997 --> 39:36.206
- Can you see an on-ramp?
- No!

39:38.918 --> 39:41.587
Okay. Damn it!
The guy's comin' after us.

39:41.671 --> 39:43.046
- Oh, no.
- Okay, we're not gonna panic.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.339
- We got a full tank of gas.
- Shit!

39:44.424 --> 39:46.675
- Right.
- We missed the on-ramp, man!

39:57.437 --> 39:59.271
Mailbox.

40:05.695 --> 40:07.654
No, no, no, no!

40:08.865 --> 40:10.073
Shit!

40:18.166 --> 40:19.625
No.

40:27.634 --> 40:30.761
Lewis! Lewis!

40:30.845 --> 40:35.390
- He said Lewis!
- Stay the fuck back, man! We got a gun!

40:37.519 --> 40:39.478
And I got a MasterCard.

40:51.741 --> 40:55.410
- Thanks, man. We thought...
- You really scared us.

40:55.495 --> 40:57.412
- Yeah.
- It wasn't the mustache, was it?

40:57.497 --> 40:59.915
My old lady keeps telling
me to shave the thing.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.709
No, no. It wasn't
the mustache, man.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.380
What the... We're not hip...
What is that thing, your club?

41:06.464 --> 41:08.632
- My tire thumper?
- Yeah.

41:08.716 --> 41:11.343
Shit. Just checkin' pressure.

41:11.427 --> 41:14.596
Yeah, pressure.
Yeah, the pressure thing.

41:14.681 --> 41:16.932
Are you boys all right
to get back to the main road?

41:17.016 --> 41:19.309
Yeah, we're fine.
Now that we're not murdered.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.104
Thanks a lot for this, man.
That was nice of you.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.857
- Y'all have a good night.
- Sorry about that.

41:29.779 --> 41:32.197
Fuckin' Fu Manchu.

41:32.282 --> 41:35.534
I've never felt like
more of a pussy in my whole life.

41:39.247 --> 41:42.040
Oh, my God.

42:11.654 --> 42:14.990
Hey, what kind of range
is there on a C.B?

42:16.618 --> 42:18.702
I don't know. Maybe

42:18.786 --> 42:20.704
five miles?

42:24.918 --> 42:27.169
Well, hey, you know,
I think we should get to a phone.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.171
Call the cops in Table Rock,

42:29.255 --> 42:31.735
leave a message and let 'em know
that Rusty Nail's in the area.

42:33.343 --> 42:35.010
What the hell is that?

42:54.447 --> 42:56.198
Go!

42:58.785 --> 43:00.786
Go, go!

43:07.251 --> 43:08.418
He's right on us!

43:19.847 --> 43:22.265
Oh, man, he's right on our ass!

43:29.023 --> 43:30.941
- No, don't use that!
- 9-1-1!

43:31.025 --> 43:33.652
We need some help. Please!
Is anyone out there?

43:38.241 --> 43:39.574
Goddamn it!

43:49.210 --> 43:53.547
Come on! Fuck!

44:02.223 --> 44:04.016
Yeah! Yeah!

44:08.688 --> 44:09.980
Tree! Tree!

44:19.532 --> 44:22.159
- You okay?
- Yeah.

44:22.243 --> 44:25.203
I'm okay. Let's go. Come on.

44:27.040 --> 44:29.499
Yeah, come on, come on.
Come on, let's go!

44:32.295 --> 44:33.795
- Let's go, let's go.
- Shit!

44:34.922 --> 44:36.965
It's not goin' anywhere!

44:39.761 --> 44:41.303
- Come on! Come on!
- Shit!

44:44.932 --> 44:46.850
Shit!

44:46.934 --> 44:48.894
All right! Come on! Go, go!

44:48.978 --> 44:51.855
Come on! Go, go, go, go!

45:08.623 --> 45:09.956
Shit!

45:15.463 --> 45:17.714
Oh, no! No!

45:27.975 --> 45:30.393
Come on! Don't kill us, man!

45:30.478 --> 45:32.896
We apologize!

45:32.980 --> 45:37.234
Don't kill us, man!
We were just playin' with you, man.

45:41.948 --> 45:43.949
Why?

45:44.659 --> 45:48.453
Just... Just for a laugh.

45:51.666 --> 45:52.958
A laugh?

45:55.837 --> 45:57.796
Just for fun.

46:01.884 --> 46:05.011
Well, I was just playin' with you, man.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.747
So, where are you now?

47:13.831 --> 47:15.999
We're about
10 miles outside of Laramie.

47:16.083 --> 47:18.919
We had some car trouble,
and we're gonna be a little late.

47:19.003 --> 47:22.464
That's all right.
Is everything okay?

47:22.548 --> 47:25.926
Yeah. No, I mean,
it's been a long drive.

47:26.052 --> 47:28.595
- All right. See you then.
- All right.

47:48.241 --> 47:49.741
They fixed the taillight.

47:55.790 --> 47:59.209
So, why don't you
just come home with me?

48:00.795 --> 48:02.754
Blow off Denver
and come home with me.

48:02.838 --> 48:05.131
No, I'm okay.

48:08.511 --> 48:10.971
Listen, I don't want
to tell Venna what happened.

48:11.931 --> 48:14.808
I don't want to ruin things.
Freak her out, you know?

48:42.169 --> 48:43.336
Hey.

48:49.010 --> 48:51.761
The color's not great, but
it's spacious. It's a big car, you know?

48:51.846 --> 48:53.263
I love it.

48:54.640 --> 48:58.226
- When did you get it?
- I've had it for a while.

48:58.311 --> 49:00.645
- It doesn't look too beat up.
- No.

49:00.730 --> 49:03.315
No, actually, I think the dents
add some character.

49:03.399 --> 49:06.568
Actually, I was talking about Fuller.

49:06.694 --> 49:08.445
- Hey!
- Hey.

49:08.529 --> 49:11.573
- So, it's been a while.
- Yeah.

49:12.450 --> 49:14.200
So. Well, have you named it yet?

49:14.285 --> 49:18.455
Well, we were thinkin'
either Tad

49:18.539 --> 49:22.167
or "Lewis' Shitty Newport."

49:26.047 --> 49:28.757
Hey! She's hot!

49:31.802 --> 49:34.471
- Hey.
- Have a good summer, Vee.

49:34.555 --> 49:37.182
Guys? My friend Charlotte.

49:37.266 --> 49:39.184
She'll be
my roommate next year.

49:39.268 --> 49:42.812
- These are the infamous Thomas boys.
- Oh, Lewis, right?

49:42.897 --> 49:45.315
Yeah. Nice to finally meet you.

49:45.399 --> 49:49.861
And, look, I'm Fuller. I'm Lewis's
older, somewhat troubled brother.

49:49.945 --> 49:51.625
And you're definitely
goin' with us, right?

49:51.655 --> 49:53.656
I kind of have to go back
to San Antonio.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.368
Isn't San Antonio
on the way to New Jersey?

49:57.578 --> 50:02.582
- It was nice to meet you.
- You're breakin' my heart, leaving like this.

50:03.501 --> 50:06.002
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Me, too. Miss you.

50:06.087 --> 50:07.688
- I love you. Be safe.
- I love you, too.

50:09.757 --> 50:11.174
That's so Charlotte.

50:11.258 --> 50:14.469
Wavin' and drivin' off like that.

50:14.553 --> 50:17.180
So, are you guys ready
for an adventure or what?

50:17.264 --> 50:18.723
Completely.

50:19.809 --> 50:23.019
Yeah! Yeah, sure.

50:23.104 --> 50:25.021
Shotgun? You want it,
you gotta call it.

50:25.106 --> 50:26.314
Shotgun.

50:51.590 --> 50:54.467
Hey. Welcome to Nebraska.

50:56.095 --> 50:58.138
See this hat I got you?

51:07.356 --> 51:09.816
So.

51:09.900 --> 51:14.654
I want to tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

51:16.365 --> 51:19.117
Picking me up.

51:19.201 --> 51:21.995
It's pretty much the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

51:30.880 --> 51:35.133
This is the part
where you kiss the girl.

51:37.470 --> 51:39.846
Well, historically.

51:41.557 --> 51:43.516
Hey, Lewis. You're blushing.

52:00.576 --> 52:01.910
Thank you.

52:06.373 --> 52:08.917
- Hey, the room's this way.
- Yeah, but the bar's this way.

52:10.127 --> 52:12.712
- Here's to...
- Nebraska!

52:13.797 --> 52:15.965
To states? All right.

52:18.636 --> 52:21.804
Look what Uncle Fuller found.

52:25.518 --> 52:27.185
Three tequilas.

52:27.269 --> 52:29.312
All right.

52:32.900 --> 52:37.028
Well, I can tie a knot
in a cherry stem with my tongue.

52:37.112 --> 52:39.531
Shut up!

52:39.615 --> 52:41.533
All right, choose your weapon.

52:41.617 --> 52:43.660
Let's see what you're made of.

52:44.745 --> 52:47.747
And... Go.

52:55.256 --> 52:57.173
Done.

52:58.133 --> 53:00.426
Still medaled.

53:00.511 --> 53:02.095
- Bronze.
- Not even close.

53:02.179 --> 53:05.306
It's straight. It wasn't even bent.

53:26.370 --> 53:29.038
May I have
three more shots of tequila,

53:29.123 --> 53:31.958
- and some matches, please?
- What's your name, sweetheart?

53:38.048 --> 53:40.091
Come on, what's your name?

53:41.302 --> 53:43.761
What's your name, sweet thing?

53:43.846 --> 53:46.723
I'm just here to buy drinks.
You can call me whatever you want.

53:46.807 --> 53:49.142
How 'bout I call you Peaches?
Do you like Peaches?

53:49.226 --> 53:51.811
- No, not really.
- You don't like Peaches?

53:51.895 --> 53:53.980
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- What?

53:54.064 --> 53:56.983
- Is this your bitch?
- Excuse me?

53:57.067 --> 54:00.320
Excuse me, I said,

54:01.280 --> 54:02.739
is this your bitch?

54:02.823 --> 54:06.117
'Cause if it is, you better
shut your bitch up.

54:06.201 --> 54:10.913
Hey, look at me, campus boy.
Did you hear what I said?

54:10.998 --> 54:12.665
Look me in the face.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.460
You better shut your bitch up.

54:15.544 --> 54:19.505
Bitch, shut up!
Are you mouthin' off again? God!

54:19.590 --> 54:24.218
Damn it! You can't turn your back
for one minute, you know.

54:24.303 --> 54:26.596
I owe you one. Now, come on!

54:26.680 --> 54:29.515
Back on the truck with you, Daisy!

54:29.600 --> 54:31.768
Drunk in the bar! Now, come on!

54:31.852 --> 54:33.478
Goddamn it!

54:35.189 --> 54:37.106
Gentlemen.

54:43.197 --> 54:45.448
Careful, those are expensive.

54:55.709 --> 54:57.043
What?

54:58.587 --> 54:59.962
Hey.

55:00.047 --> 55:02.006
Hey!

55:03.884 --> 55:05.009
Hey.

55:06.512 --> 55:08.805
I got a plan.

55:08.889 --> 55:12.016
- And what's your plan?
- Let's never go back there again.

55:12.101 --> 55:15.645
I can't wait
to never go back there.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.188
Yeah.

55:19.066 --> 55:21.401
I'll be in my presidential suite.

55:23.278 --> 55:26.280
Excellent.
We're gonna head to our...

55:26.365 --> 55:29.575
- Our spinning hotel room.
- Okay. See you later.

55:31.995 --> 55:34.455
Good night.

55:40.129 --> 55:42.088
I get the orange one!

55:43.507 --> 55:45.425
This one.

55:51.223 --> 55:53.683
Hey! See, I told you
this was a good place.

55:53.767 --> 55:56.227
Adult channels.

55:56.311 --> 55:58.187
Good. Hey, are you
in the mood for

55:58.272 --> 56:02.900
a story, or, like,
a collection of scenes?

56:02.985 --> 56:06.738
She isn't a Navy SEAL.

56:06.822 --> 56:09.282
God! Takes me right out.

56:11.827 --> 56:13.703
Hey, Venna's great, man.

56:13.787 --> 56:15.621
She's got...

56:20.043 --> 56:22.795
I mean, you guys...
You guys are just friends, right?

56:24.548 --> 56:27.258
I mean, that's what you said.

56:27.342 --> 56:30.803
Right? You're just hangin' out, and...

56:33.015 --> 56:36.142
'Cause if you're anything more than that,

56:36.226 --> 56:39.562
you tell me right now,
and I'm gonna just... I'll...

56:42.107 --> 56:43.191
off.

56:43.275 --> 56:44.817
You know?

56:46.528 --> 56:48.529
Great.

56:57.206 --> 56:59.457
We never got those last drinks.

57:00.250 --> 57:01.751
Yeah...

57:03.253 --> 57:05.254
You know, if we're gonna
get an early start,

57:05.339 --> 57:07.590
we should probably
just crash and go to bed.

57:07.674 --> 57:09.884
Yeah. But, hey...

57:09.968 --> 57:13.054
I'm a licensed bartender.

57:14.473 --> 57:18.142
Yeah, I'd show you my license,
but my hands are full, so...

57:19.686 --> 57:21.562
Where's your better half?

57:21.647 --> 57:24.357
He's busy. Snoring.

57:25.859 --> 57:29.821
Well, you know, I really don't
think that I can drink anymore.

57:29.905 --> 57:33.616
I disagree.
And I'm a professional.

57:38.497 --> 57:41.791
You know what's amazing?

57:41.875 --> 57:44.377
Nobody knows
where we are right now.

57:46.463 --> 57:50.299
Just kind of

57:50.384 --> 57:52.301
out there.

57:53.679 --> 57:56.764
Floating.

57:56.849 --> 58:00.893
If anybody wanted to find us
for some strange reason,

58:00.978 --> 58:03.646
they couldn't.

58:04.648 --> 58:06.649
What am I talking about?

58:06.733 --> 58:09.569
I have no idea. Here, try this.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.247
That's good.

58:21.331 --> 58:23.875
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

58:23.959 --> 58:26.627
Is Lewis okay?
He doesn't normally drink so much.

58:28.380 --> 58:30.298
Yeah, he's totally fine.

58:41.268 --> 58:44.270
Fuller, get the phone.

59:00.454 --> 59:02.538
Hello.

59:02.623 --> 59:05.708
Now I thought
you said there was no girl.

59:05.792 --> 59:09.837
- What?
- You said there was no girl.

59:09.922 --> 59:11.839
Fuller.

59:17.471 --> 59:21.307
Listen, there...
There isn't any girl.

59:21.391 --> 59:26.646
Then, what's she doing
in the other room with your brother?

59:41.328 --> 59:42.495
He's out there!

59:42.579 --> 59:44.205
- He's watching us!
- Rusty Nail?

59:44.289 --> 59:45.915
- He just called me.
- Who's Rusty Nail?

59:45.999 --> 59:47.083
He called you on the phone?

59:47.167 --> 59:50.127
Yeah, just now. He knew you were
in here. He's watching us!

59:50.212 --> 59:51.420
- There's somebody watching us?
- He just called.

59:51.505 --> 59:52.505
What did he say?

59:52.589 --> 59:55.716
He said, "I thought there was no girl."
And what you were doing

59:55.801 --> 59:57.760
in the room with her,
which is an excellent question.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.637
We're gettin' out of here,
so put on your shoes.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:00.972
I already paid for this room.

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:03.724
- Just do it!
- How scared am I supposed to be?

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:15.236
Much more than usual.

01:00:51.732 --> 01:00:53.983
Okay, there's nobody behind us.
Can somebody please talk to me?

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.985
He knows we're brothers.
How does that happen?

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:58.904
All right, we're goin' to the police,
we're gettin' off the highway,

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.490
- then we're goin' home!
- Lewis, goddamn it!

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.826
Something weird happened to us
before we picked you up.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:06.287
I didn't wanna tell you 'cause
I didn't wanna freak you out.

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:07.663
Tell me what?

01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:09.874
- You want the short version?
- Talk to me.

01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:12.501
There's this sick guy.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:14.147
- He put this guy in a coma.
- Sick how?

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:16.630
This Rusty Nail guy
did something?

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:20.259
- Because of something that we did.
- What did you do?

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.349
Hey, man, what the hell
are you doing?

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:31.062
He wants us
to look in the trunk.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.482
There were signs
spray painted back there,

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:36.484
"Look in the trunk."

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:40.196
Signs? What makes you think
they're for us?

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:43.908
Look.

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:49.080
What's going on here?

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:56.796
That's a pretty elaborate
thing to do, paint those signs.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.131
- No, no, no! No!
- What? God!

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:01.133
- Don't open it!
- Why?

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.302
What if there's a head
or a body in there, man?

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.970
Oh, man, could be a bomb.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:06.856
Think a bomb's a reason
not to open the trunk?

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:07.890
He's in the trunk!

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.850
I say we don't open the trunk!

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:13.562
I'm not getting back into the car
till I know what's in the trunk.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.856
What are you doing?

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:25.825
Oh, shit.

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:31.914
Okay, we plug it in,
and we don't talk on it.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.542
We just listen.

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.670
And whatever he says, we just...
We just go straight to the police.

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.464
I'm not going to go anywhere

01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:43.551
until somebody tells me why
I should be afraid of a radio.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.740
Candy Cane, are you there?

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:10.661
That's right.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:16.375
I don't mean my Candy Cane.

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:19.044
I mean yours.

01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:21.589
Venna?

01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:24.633
- How does he know my name?
- We're not getting into it with this guy.

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:27.011
Let him talk all he wants.
Just tell me where we're going.

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:30.723
You know when a corpse
can't be identified?

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:35.978
No next of kin.
No one to claim the body.

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:40.649
What they do is,
they cut off all the fingers.

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:42.943
All 10 of them.

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:45.446
And then they cut off the jaw.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:49.116
They cut off the person's jaw

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:53.412
and they put it all in a jar.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:58.375
They put it in a jar
with some number on it.

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:08.962
Oh, my God, that's Charlotte.

01:04:09.638 --> 01:04:11.555
- What?
- That's Charlotte.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.974
- That girl? Your roommate?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:18.062
Hey, what the hell do you want?

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:23.025
I want you to go to the State Line
Truck Stop parking lot.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:26.278
- I'll find you there.
- Venna, please help me!

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:29.031
And if you go to the police,

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:33.786
I will take her apart
piece by piece.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.729
Good morning.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:05.859
Hey, he's back. We're here.

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:11.198
Okay, here's what I want.
Fuller, Lewis.

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.994
I want you two to head inside.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.913
Take a seat at the counter.

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:21.709
Order six cheeseburgers each.

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:25.713
What about Venna?

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.507
She stays put.

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:33.554
But you two are going in naked.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.556
Naked?

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:42.688
If we go in there dicks hangin',

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:47.026
they're just gonna call the police.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:51.155
Come on. It's just for fun.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:53.198
Bullshit, I'm staying here.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:58.162
Just stay up front.
I want you to keep the car running.

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:00.748
And if you see anything,
honk the horn and drive.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:07.546
God, I can't fucking believe
we're doing this.

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:20.017
Billy, come on. Get in the car.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:22.061
Sissy.

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:34.990
Now they know what it feels like

01:06:35.075 --> 01:06:37.451
to be the brunt of the joke.

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.955
Your heart pounding.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.416
Face burning hot.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:48.337
Now they know what it feels like

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:51.840
to be the fucking punch line.

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:56.095
They told me what they did
to you, and I'm very, very sorry.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.639
Well, it's a little late
for that, isn't it?

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:00.974
I bet your friends
had a really good laugh

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:05.813
seeing me standing there
in the rain, holding my bottle.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.234
I think sometimes people don't know
what they're doing, you know?

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:14.363
They don't think what they say or how
they act can really affect anyone.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:21.787
Well, that's a lesson your friends are
gonna have to learn the hard way.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.997
You wanna see Charlotte alive again?

01:07:24.082 --> 01:07:25.999
Here's what you're gonna have to do.

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:33.966
Twelve cheeseburgers, please.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:39.930
You want fries with that?

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:47.187
Is this a fraternity stunt?

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.231
Because if this wasn't
my restaurant...

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:52.192
A man's gonna kill our friend
if we don't come in here like this.

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:54.945
I'd say it was a pretty good one.

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:56.822
- We're not joking, man.
- Oh, shit!

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.747
Man, we should
be going to the cops.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:09.710
We're not going anywhere
till we find out what he wants.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:14.965
Right up here.
This is where we turn.

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:17.885
That's what he said.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.042
You out there?

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.795
We're here.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.340
Something special's
waiting for you.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:59.218
I'd say it's about
100 feet up the road.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.595
So, get out of the car.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.723
Wait. I'm not walkin'
one foot out of this...

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.808
We don't have a choice.
We're doing what he says.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:09.394
- What?
- He's got Charlotte. Get out of the car.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.731
- Wait! Goddamn it!
- Get out of the car!

01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:22.032
What the hell is this?

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:24.033
Wait, how many feet did he say?

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.453
A hundred. A hundred.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:37.089
Do you hear or see anything?

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.131
This is it.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.277
Hi.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.904
- He's not slowing down.
- He's not gonna stop.

01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:03.699
- What's he doing?
- He's not gonna stop. He's not gonna stop!

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:06.076
- He's not slowing down!
- Run! Car! Go!

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:13.000
Run! Run!

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:21.300
Wait.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:24.011
What the hell is he doing?

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.830
He's coming.
Let's go! Let's go!

01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:55.876
Let's go! Come on! Let's go!

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.628
Run! Run! Run!

01:10:59.422 --> 01:10:59.922
Run!

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:08.055
Turn left!

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:12.517
Keep going!

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:20.233
That way!

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:22.694
Get down! Get down!

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:32.704
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:38.543
Let's go! Come on!

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:57.729
Come on!

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:03.735
Go! Run!

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.613
Turn, quick!

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.958
Venna?

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.537
Lewis!

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:15.682
Venna?

01:13:15.767 --> 01:13:17.642
Lewis.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:27.027
Lewis.

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:36.036
Lewis!

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:43.293
Venna.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:07.692
Fuller!

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:23.542
- Venna?
- Lewis?

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:28.380
Fuller?

01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:35.929
- Lewis!
- Venna?

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:38.265
- You guys okay? Oh, man.
- What?

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:40.267
- Hey, Venna.
- Did you see that?

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:42.269
- Yeah.
- I was sitting back there.

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:45.772
- Venna. You can come out. He's leaving.
- He tried to back up.

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:49.901
- Venna?
- You let her out of your sight?

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:52.070
- Venna?
- Lewis, goddamn it!

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.906
- You let her out of your sight?
- Where the hell were you?

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.158
I was over there, man!
Back there!

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.744
- Venna! Venna, come out here!
- Lewis!

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:03.790
Lewis, help me, please!

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:09.671
Lewis!

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:13.216
Stop, you gotta
leave her alone! Please.

01:15:13.301 --> 01:15:15.385
- We'll do whatever you want.
- Lewis!

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:19.431
You don't feel like
meeting me at a motel later, do you?

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:21.474
We'll do whatever you want!

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:26.563
Meet me at the next town.
Medford. Room 17. Midnight.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.774
Do not be one minute late.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.110
Lewis, gas tank! Come on!

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:35.074
And if there's any way that you could
bring a bottle of pink champagne...

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:35.916
What are you doing?

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:38.658
- Come on, goddamn it!
- That's my favorite.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:56.551
Venna.

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:09.814
Seven miles. Hey!

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:14.110
Come on!

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:17.948
Hey! Hey!
He said not to call the cops!

01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:23.870
Keep a lookout.
Don't worry. I've done this before.

01:16:23.955 --> 01:16:25.872
What?

01:16:38.678 --> 01:16:40.887
Hey, man, we're runnin' out of time.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.977
God damn,

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:50.689
thing won't start.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.440
Hello.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.529
Hey.

01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:03.868
- Hey.
- Need some help?

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.871
No, I think we're fine.
Damn Ford won't start.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:10.041
- And he wonders why I drive a Chevy.
- No shit.

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:13.503
Come on. Come on.

01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:16.172
I got some jumper cables.
I'll hook you up.

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:19.718
No, no, really.
I think we're all right.

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:21.052
It's just flooded, right?
You'll get it started.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.846
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:25.348
Just take it and turn it
all the way off...

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:26.558
- Right.
- Then on.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.936
Want me to show you?
You gotta hesitate it for two seconds.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.275
- There it is.
- All right, perfect.

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:37.569
Hey, you're the man.
Thanks a lot.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:48.246
Where the hell you goin'?
That's my truck!

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:53.043
Everything's going to be all right.

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:55.462
We're gonna get Venna.

01:17:56.881 --> 01:17:59.716
And we're gonna find Charlotte.

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:03.511
Everything's...
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:08.600
Don't you think?

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:30.789
Okay, motel. Motel.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:38.463
- Which one?
- He didn't say. Shit!

01:18:55.106 --> 01:18:56.189
Venna?

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:57.649
Hold on.

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:02.195
- Venna!
- I said hold on!

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:05.532
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:34.185
Help you?

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:37.689
- Is this your room?
- Yeah. What of it?

01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:59.210
What's the problem here?

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.880
- Shit!
- What did we miss?

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.612
Hello, police.

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:29.991
Yeah. I'd like to report
some dead bodies.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:33.077
Your name, sir?

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:55.642
Hello?

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.769
Hello?

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.064
Come on.

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:06.861
Hello?

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:13.451
- It's unlocked.
- Comin' in.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:19.499
- Hey, we're comin' in.
- We're comin' in.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:27.507
Venna? Hello?

01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:35.848
- Venna?
- Hey.

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.779
The switch.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:05.962
- Hello?
- Nice, isn't it,

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:08.214
being on the receiving end?

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.135
- Where the hell's Venna?
- Who?

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:14.345
Look, I'm not kidding.
Where's Venna?

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:17.682
You see, you might not
be kidding, but I am.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.685
- What did he say?
- That's the point.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:24.188
- Get it?
- No, believe me,

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.190
you made your point, all right?

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.276
And we're sorry.
We told you that.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.779
Hey, Lewis, you know what
I think is a real kick?

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:37.160
Pretending the person that
I'm talking to is right next to me.

01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:40.079
- Right next to me.
- What?

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:43.207
What the fuck is he talking...

01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:48.254
Not what you expected, is it?

01:22:48.339 --> 01:22:53.760
That's not what I expected
when I came to room 17, neither.

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:57.555
You guys sittin' right next door

01:22:57.639 --> 01:23:00.475
listening through the wall.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:04.437
That's what you did, right?
You listened through the wall.

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.817
What do you want?

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:14.697
I just want to enjoy this for a second.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:16.908
We gotta call the cops.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:20.036
No. If we call the cops,
he'll kill her.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.872
- Well, what the fuck, man?
- You...

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:25.083
I think you should go outside.

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:27.127
- See if you can see in his room.
- Are you crazy?

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:31.631
Just do it! I'll keep him on the phone.
Go out there now. Go.

01:23:48.816 --> 01:23:50.983
Shit!

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:54.445
- You still there?
- Oh, yeah, I'm here.

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:58.533
Why don't you come on over?
Your Candy Cane's waiting.

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:15.716
Listen. We learned
our lesson, all right?

01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:18.594
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:21.222
So, this is what
we're gonna do, okay?

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:23.266
You're gonna
give us back Venna,

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:27.019
then Charlotte and we're gonna
walk away from this whole thing.

01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:28.938
And we're not gonna
tell anybody, all right?

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:31.524
And we sure as hell
won't tell the cops.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.509
Watch this.
It's gonna be hilarious.

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.279
Don't!

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:21.199
Don't open the door!

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:25.870
Don't open the door!
Don't open the door! Don't open the door!

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:40.384
Come on!

01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:46.349
Wait! Shit!

01:25:47.518 --> 01:25:49.393
Lewis!

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:12.250
Fuller, where are you?

01:26:38.735 --> 01:26:40.570
Fuller?

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.657
Fuller, come on.
Let's get you off this.

01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:47.368
- Don't!
- What?

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:54.083
Pipe! Jesus, there's a pipe
in my leg!

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:12.476
We've got a body in here!

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:14.520
We've got a possible 839!
Search every room!

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:21.319
Oh, jeez! What is he doing?

01:27:26.617 --> 01:27:29.327
Come on, come on, come on!

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:32.496
Sheriff's Department!
Open up! Kick it open!

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:37.209
Clear the door!

01:27:38.295 --> 01:27:40.171
Twenty-four, clear!

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:49.263
Move! On the ground! Now!

01:27:49.348 --> 01:27:52.308
- Watch it!
- Twenty-three, clear!

01:27:52.392 --> 01:27:54.352
All right, let's go!

01:27:58.148 --> 01:27:59.357
Police!

01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:03.903
- Come on, come on, come on, come on!
- Twenty-two's clear!

01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:06.405
Come on, put your foot...
Put your feet on this!

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:08.658
Twenty-one, clear.

01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:16.457
Oh, jeez! Jeez!

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:19.085
- Twenty, clear!
- Come on, get out!

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:23.506
Sheriff's Department! Open up!

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.431
Nineteen, clear!

01:28:32.516 --> 01:28:33.974
- Venna.
- What?

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:36.435
You gotta stop 'em from opening the door!
Go!

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.561
Go!

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:41.774
Sheriff's Department! Open up!

01:29:00.711 --> 01:29:02.545
Show me your hands!

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.929
Help, Lewis!

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:15.599
Don't move! Don't move!

01:29:22.983 --> 01:29:26.444
- Lewis!
- Just freeze right there!

01:29:26.528 --> 01:29:30.156
- Lewis!
- That's my brother in the back.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.880
Get back on the ground!
Get on the ground!

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.159
Don't you shoot!

01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:35.453
- Don't shoot!
- Stay with the girl!

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.796
Hey!

01:29:46.673 --> 01:29:48.299
Pull!

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:52.470
- No! No, no, no, no!
- Freeze!

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:54.555
Shoot the truck!
Shoot the truck!

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:55.806
It's not gonna stop!

01:30:17.037 --> 01:30:18.078
Run!

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:44.939
Jeez!

01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:51.612
Oh, God!

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:53.656
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:10.566
Yes, sir.

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:12.860
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:14.862
Did you figure out
who that guy was?

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:16.822
He's just some trucker
named Jones.

01:32:16.907 --> 01:32:19.950
Looks like he drove for
some ice company in Wyoming.

01:32:23.914 --> 01:32:25.831
Ice company?

01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:29.543
What's goin' on?

01:32:32.172 --> 01:32:34.298
Breaker one-nine, come on.

01:32:35.717 --> 01:32:38.218
Breaker, breaker.
Lookin' for a break.

01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:43.349
Westbound I-80.
How's that storm lookin'?

01:32:45.685 --> 01:32:47.645
Is it rainin' out there?

01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:51.482
Hello?

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:54.818
I'm lookin' forward
to this storm.

01:32:56.154 --> 01:32:57.863
Keeps everyone inside.

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.327
Washes everything clean.

01:33:04.305 --> 01:33:10.600
