00:02.600 --> 00:03.795
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:03.880 --> 00:06.076
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.160 --> 00:07.196
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:10.595
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:15.234
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.320 --> 00:17.551
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.871
<i>she changed the present...</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>and now our world
is more dangerous than ever.</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:28.277
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:30.033
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.120 --> 00:32.237
Who is your accomplice, Nora?

00:32.320 --> 00:34.551
The cure's finished,
and it works.

00:34.640 --> 00:35.869
- What do you do?
- Trust me.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.440
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.590
We made an arrangement.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.751
<i>We cure him and then Grace.</i>

00:40.840 --> 00:43.992
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.480
<i>Something big is coming.</i>

00:45.560 --> 00:46.560
What's going on?

00:49.520 --> 00:50.715
Please!

00:50.800 --> 00:52.016
If Cicada
doesn't exist anymore,

00:52.040 --> 00:53.269
who was that?

00:54.680 --> 00:57.878
I've missed you, Uncle Orlin.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.160
Something went wrong.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.277
We got Dwyer.
We gave him the cure.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.635
This should all be over.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.632
But another Cicada showed up,

01:10.720 --> 01:13.280
took Dwyer and the dagger.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.272
Thawne!
Did you hear what I said?

01:16.360 --> 01:17.840
Another Cicada showed up.

01:17.920 --> 01:18.990
I know.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.037
I know.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.356
Who is that?

01:26.200 --> 01:27.759
I have no idea.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.596
You said manipulating
the timeline would stop Cicada.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.478
You said you knew
what you were doing!

01:35.560 --> 01:37.279
I know what I said.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.395
I was very wrong.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.598
What do we do?
What do we do now?

01:45.680 --> 01:48.240
I can't help you anymore...

01:48.320 --> 01:49.834
little runner.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.155
What?

01:51.240 --> 01:53.994
You have to help me.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.558
It's too late.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.399
No.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.233
No, there's gotta be something
we can do.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.994
You... you have to help!

02:05.080 --> 02:07.640
There is only one thing
left to do.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.039
Tell your father.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.751
You tell your father
everything.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.480
Your lung's healing.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.816
It'll take a while
for you to get

02:38.840 --> 02:40.160
the rest of your strength back,

02:40.240 --> 02:42.835
but don't worry.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.310
I'll take care of you.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.993
Like you took care of me.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.873
Who are you?

03:07.880 --> 03:10.554
Grace?

03:12.200 --> 03:14.112
Hi, Uncle Orlin.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.270
But you were...

03:15.360 --> 03:17.192
A ten-year-old girl
in a coma?

03:17.720 --> 03:21.077
Eventually, that girl
at the hospital wakes up.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.072
She grows older,

03:23.160 --> 03:25.311
and she becomes me.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.917
You're from the future,
like Flash's daughter.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.357
I came back here
to work with you again.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.235
And I remember everything
you taught me, Uncle Orlin.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.954
Now, get some rest.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.359
Wait.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.593
Where are we?

03:49.040 --> 03:50.997
No one will find you
while I'm gone.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.515
There's noodles in the pantry
if you're hungry.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.954
And ice cream.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.633
Where are you going?

04:03.680 --> 04:07.037
To take care
of something important.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.918
When I get back...

04:11.280 --> 04:14.671
We're gonna figure out
how you get your powers back.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.478
<i>And Dr. Ambres never talked</i>

04:27.560 --> 04:29.358
about her relationship
with Orlin Dwyer?

04:29.440 --> 04:31.318
She never really talked
about anything.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.756
After her fiancé died,
she wasn't quite the same.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.399
How so?

04:35.480 --> 04:37.676
Angry. Withdrawn.

04:37.760 --> 04:38.876
Only time she seemed happy

04:38.960 --> 04:40.376
was when she was with that girl
in the coma.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.996
Can you think of anything
that might help us find Dwyer?

04:44.080 --> 04:45.799
I'm sorry, Detective.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.670
Okay, if you come up
with anything,

04:51.760 --> 04:53.991
would you give me
a call, please?

04:54.080 --> 04:55.480
Thank you.

04:57.640 --> 04:58.960
Somebody's gotta know
something.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.760
Everyone we've talked to
is telling the truth.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.309
I think Ambres was the only one
working with Dwyer.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.471
Well, look, we'll pore over
the files at CCPD.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.199
Maybe we missed something.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.416
We'll let you know if we come
up with anything, all right?

05:14.520 --> 05:16.239
You okay?

05:16.320 --> 05:18.755
I just, uh...

05:18.880 --> 05:21.111
don't know what to do.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.953
Yeah, me neither.

05:23.040 --> 05:26.033
We've hit walls before, though.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.032
We'll figure it out.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.677
All right.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.515
Nora West-Allen,
let's see what we have here.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.876
Boring. Boring. Boring.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.714
Banality. Boring. Boring.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.951
Come on.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.790
I know you're working
with someone, but no names.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.035
Clever girl.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.600
<i>Hey.</i>

06:03.680 --> 06:05.416
<i>This Cortex isn't gonna
clean itself, you know.</i>

06:10.280 --> 06:13.000
Oh, nice table.
Liking the new digs.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.833
Well, technically,
they're old digs,

06:14.920 --> 06:18.311
but I guess there is an upside
to remodeling after an attack.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.675
Did you guys find anything?

06:19.760 --> 06:20.876
Well, I put out an article,

06:20.960 --> 06:22.056
but none of my readers
have seen Dwyer

06:22.080 --> 06:23.116
or this new Cicada.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.034
I talked to Earl Cox,
all my contacts... nothing.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.656
How long till the satellite
can scan for dark matter?

06:27.680 --> 06:29.000
How about now?

06:29.080 --> 06:31.311
Well, if this new Cicada

06:31.400 --> 06:32.993
even has traceable dark matter.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.816
I mean, we've seen
Cicada <i>numéro deux</i> do things

06:34.840 --> 06:36.160
that we've not seen
before, right?

06:36.200 --> 06:37.793
Yeah, I mean,
he can dampen powers,

06:37.880 --> 06:39.997
he can control the dagger
just like Dwyer,

06:40.080 --> 06:42.356
but it's... I don't know,
it's also like...

06:42.440 --> 06:44.557
Like he could take control
of us.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.096
Let's hope Caitlin
can figure that out

06:46.120 --> 06:47.270
at the Tannhauser site

06:47.360 --> 06:49.431
while we figure out
where he is.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.070
We got a Starchives asset
in Kolins Woods.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.230
Starchives? What is this?

06:57.320 --> 06:59.152
Well, it's a place
where we house

06:59.240 --> 07:01.216
everything Flash related...
prototypes, super suits...

07:01.240 --> 07:03.038
I mean,
everything since day one.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.336
And the alarm
is going off because...

07:04.360 --> 07:07.831
Because somebody just stole
something from us.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.675
Something really,
really not good.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.319
You guys
at the Starchives yet?

07:19.400 --> 07:20.595
We just got here.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.160
No sign of forced entry.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.754
Or overhead lighting,
apparently.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.434
Pretty sure that's a vacuum.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.840
<i>Okay, keep looking!</i>

07:28.920 --> 07:30.832
Remind me again
what we're looking for?

07:30.920 --> 07:36.518
Uh, it's like a huge
round glass bubble.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.438
You mean like that?

07:41.520 --> 07:43.079
- Yeah.
- We found it!

07:43.160 --> 07:44.736
<i>Thawne's Time Sphere?
Are you sure?</i>

07:44.760 --> 07:46.399
What do you mean "am I sure?"

07:46.480 --> 07:48.597
- Pretty sure.
- I'm looking right at it, why?

07:51.120 --> 07:53.316
'Cause we're looking
right at it too.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.714
So it's here
and it's in the Starchives

08:00.800 --> 08:02.757
at the same time?

08:02.840 --> 08:04.718
Somebody stole the plans
and made a duplicate?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.393
Not exactly.

08:06.480 --> 08:10.440
Guys, cue up
Operation: Shazam.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.514
<i>Ready.</i>

08:19.960 --> 08:22.714
One scratch
on two different Time Spheres.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.156
Or one scratch
on one Time Sphere.

08:25.240 --> 08:28.153
That's impossible...
unless...

08:28.240 --> 08:29.390
Unless it's the same one.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.517
It is the same one.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.239
This is our Time Sphere.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.198
Which shows up here
at the same time

08:35.280 --> 08:38.193
that someone who looks like
Cicada kidnaps Orlin Dwyer.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.999
It's not a coincidence.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.280
So whoever kidnapped Dwyer...

08:41.360 --> 08:43.158
Is the Cicada
from the future.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.032
<i>♪ What a wonderful night ♪</i>

08:51.120 --> 08:52.270
<i>♪ Let's dance ♪</i>

09:21.680 --> 09:23.034
You move, I shoot.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.749
That was dumb.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.275
It was him, wasn't it?

10:09.360 --> 10:10.430
The other Cicada.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.591
Guy didn't know what hit him.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.478
You said he was after
a cold case file?

10:14.560 --> 10:16.392
- Are any of them digitized?
- Not yet.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.790
But the only way
to figure out what's missing

10:18.880 --> 10:20.872
is to see what's still here.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.280
I mean...

10:22.360 --> 10:25.432
I could help with that.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.472
All right, everybody.
Clear out.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.789
CSI needs this scene.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.470
Hey, by the way,

10:32.560 --> 10:34.040
this might not be
our only lead.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.077
Do you remember
that Time Sphere

10:36.160 --> 10:37.435
that we built for Thawne?

10:37.520 --> 10:39.239
That big hamster ball thing?

10:39.320 --> 10:41.880
Someone stole one
in the future to come here.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.680
For what, our...
our Cicada copycat?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.797
It makes sense.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.315
I can't even believe
I just said that.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.400
Okay, son, you're on.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.480
Yup.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.958
Okay,
I went through everything.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.236
There was indeed
one file missing.

10:58.320 --> 11:03.349
And it's... thank you...
it is from 2017.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.760
That's it.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.056
All right,
I'll do some digging,

11:06.080 --> 11:07.355
see why this was so important,

11:07.440 --> 11:08.999
they had to cut a hole
in the wall.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.072
- I'll help.
- Yeah.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.313
<i>Are you sure
you want to do this?</i>

11:18.400 --> 11:20.835
I mean, this is a big deal.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.550
Like, "not Penny's boat"
kind of big deal.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.830
Okay.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.271
Kamilla Hwang,
you and I are officially...

11:34.360 --> 11:36.556
"In a Relationship."

11:36.640 --> 11:38.313
- Social media official!
- What!

11:38.400 --> 11:40.437
Yeah.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.000
Larry, my usual.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.151
It's Jason.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.074
Ralph!
What um...

11:47.160 --> 11:48.389
what are you doing here?

11:48.480 --> 11:49.960
Same as you...
taking a break

11:50.040 --> 11:51.190
from saving the old world.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.272
- Um...
- Look at you two.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.431
Young love.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.989
So, uh, K-Dawg,
when you gonna meet the group?

11:58.080 --> 11:59.958
Uh, the group?

12:00.040 --> 12:02.555
Yeah, the squad, the team.
The gang.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.791
Uh, hey, we're actually
in the middle of a date here.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.496
Actually, we're at the end
of a date, babe.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.239
- I have that gig.
- Oh, right.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.640
Your Easter thing.
You have to go.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.637
- She has to go.
- Oh, uh, Cisco?

12:11.720 --> 12:14.189
I'm supposed to tell you
that Barry wanted to talk to you.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.595
Probably could've texted that.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.433
Yeah, probably.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.040
Okay, well,
Easter Bunny photos

12:22.080 --> 12:23.355
aren't gonna take themselves.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.800
It's kind of
a bottom-of-the-barrel

12:24.880 --> 12:25.950
photography gig,

12:26.040 --> 12:27.320
but gotta start somewhere,
right?

12:27.360 --> 12:28.680
- Totally.
- Anywhere but here.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.911
- Why don't I walk you out?
- Oh, okay.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.676
Damn it, Larry!

12:43.760 --> 12:44.830
Still Jason!

12:50.360 --> 12:53.194
<i>Voilà, voilà, voilà.</i>

12:53.280 --> 12:55.397
Let's see what we have here.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.393
Thawne's Time Sphere.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.915
What are you doing,
Sherloque?

13:03.800 --> 13:06.235
Well, I'm pursuing a new lead

13:06.320 --> 13:08.277
to identify the mystery Cicada.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.840
Well,
if you needed information

13:09.920 --> 13:11.736
about the Time Sphere,
you could've just asked.

13:11.760 --> 13:15.197
That's right,
but memory can be deceiving.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.512
Especially for a regular human.

13:18.600 --> 13:22.435
No, I prefer a primary source.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.670
And this new lead,

13:23.760 --> 13:25.877
were you pursuing it
last night too?

13:25.960 --> 13:28.395
- That's right.
- And all last weekend?

13:28.480 --> 13:29.630
That's right.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.554
I am working very hard
to get...

13:32.640 --> 13:34.279
to get what I want.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.840
Joe traced the file
that our new Cicada took.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.639
There was a meta attack here
two years ago.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.837
Two people died,
and the meta was never ID'd.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.071
So this new Cicada
might be going after this meta?

14:01.160 --> 14:03.117
- Well...
- Okay.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.520
What do I vibe?

14:04.600 --> 14:06.353
Well, we're not exactly sure.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.536
All the street cameras were
destroyed by the explosion.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.917
The original ATM was too fried
to recover any data.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.753
- For real?
- Yeah.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.399
Well, I'm out.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.075
I can't vibe a crime scene
that does not exist.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.799
Literally does not exist.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.357
I mean, even this ATM is,
like, brand-spanking-new.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.830
But this concrete isn't.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.320
It still has scorch marks
on it.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.834
Hold this.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.951
Sweetie!
You forgot your ATM card.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.675
What'd you see?

14:51.760 --> 14:53.399
The victims.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.278
They were
Grace Gibbons' parents.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.157
In Grace's mindscape,
she saw herself as Cicada.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.597
And another Cicada shows up
targeting her parents' killer.

15:06.680 --> 15:07.955
It has to be her.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.475
The new Cicada
is Grace Gibbons.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.710
From the future.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.594
Time travel sucks.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.309
Grace, what's wrong?

15:31.880 --> 15:33.360
Look at this.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.513
It's your parents' murder file?

15:39.600 --> 15:42.274
Do you see what they did?

15:42.360 --> 15:43.360
Nothing!

15:43.440 --> 15:45.238
Three witnesses saw a woman

15:45.320 --> 15:47.576
in a hoodie leave the scene,
but did Central City's finest

15:47.600 --> 15:49.831
put out a search party
or an APB?

15:49.920 --> 15:53.231
No. They thought it sounded
like a job for the Flash.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.391
Look at this debris
from the scene.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.757
Looks like a chemical burn.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.309
It's not a chemical burn.

16:04.440 --> 16:08.070
It's charred
dark matter residue.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.436
We can track the meta
who left it.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.398
How?

16:12.480 --> 16:15.473
I can't track
an exact real time location,

16:15.560 --> 16:16.789
but I can get close.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.592
Found her.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.313
Grace, what are you doing?

16:31.400 --> 16:33.551
In the time I'm from,
their plague spreads

16:33.640 --> 16:36.712
across the world,
unchecked, unabated.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.190
But now that I'm here with you,

16:39.280 --> 16:41.397
we can change that.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.830
And the mission can succeed.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.513
What mission?

16:45.600 --> 16:47.114
Ours.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.590
To kill every last meta-human.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.432
Starting with the rat bastard
who killed my parents.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.316
So, Cicada Il is really
Grace from the future,

17:11.400 --> 17:13.278
and she's trying to get revenge
on the meta

17:13.359 --> 17:15.795
that murdered her parents,
and that killer meta is here?

17:15.880 --> 17:18.759
Cisco saw the last PIN
that was entered into the ATM.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.593
The card belongs
to Vickie and John Bolen.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.272
We already went
by their house,

17:22.359 --> 17:24.136
and a neighbor said
they were having a party here.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.752
Um, I think this is them.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.479
Excuse me, sir?

17:27.560 --> 17:29.950
Detective Joe West.
We're from CCPD.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.236
Are you Mr. John Bolen?

17:32.360 --> 17:33.919
I am.
How can I help you?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
What's going on? Oh.

17:35.001 --> 17:36.195
Sorry to be rude,

17:36.280 --> 17:37.680
but we're in the middle
of a party.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.911
This won't take long.
Um...

17:40.000 --> 17:43.516
Do you remember using an ATM
on Kingswell and 42nd

17:43.600 --> 17:45.751
around May 4th, 2017?

17:45.840 --> 17:47.433
There was an explosion
that day.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.115
We think a meta-human
might have been involved.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.953
Hon, why don't you and Alice
start gathering

17:52.040 --> 17:53.235
the kids for a team photo?

17:53.320 --> 17:55.471
I'll talk to the nice officers.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.393
Okay.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.216
I can't believe you found me
after all this time.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.153
We'd just like to know
what happened that day.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.879
Did you blow up that ATM?

18:06.960 --> 18:08.679
I-it all happened so fast.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.194
I touched the machine,

18:10.280 --> 18:12.272
and it was like
something turned on in me.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.040
You hyper-accelerated
the molecules in the ATM,

18:15.120 --> 18:17.396
causing a violent
chain reaction.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.472
I just know I saw sparks
and ran.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.710
Then I heard this explosion

18:20.800 --> 18:22.598
and money was flying
everywhere.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.672
It looked like I was trying
to rob the bank.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.719
I was too afraid to go back.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.154
At least no one got hurt.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.360
Mrs. Bolen,
we have reason to believe

18:33.440 --> 18:35.397
a killer is targeting you.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.073
Why?

18:37.160 --> 18:39.914
It's because
of your... abilities.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.515
Listen, we'd like to put you
in federal protection

18:42.640 --> 18:43.960
to keep your family safe.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.554
And what would I tell
my husband?

18:45.640 --> 18:46.869
Or my daughter?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.394
"Hey, sorry, Mommy has powers.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.040
We all have to leave
our lives behind."

18:50.080 --> 18:52.640
They don't know
about your powers?

18:52.720 --> 18:54.712
Of course not.
No one does.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.393
You think I'm proud of this?

18:56.480 --> 18:58.437
I think they have a right
to know the truth.

18:58.520 --> 18:59.670
They're your family.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.696
And who the hell
do you think you are,

19:02.720 --> 19:03.790
telling me what to do?

19:03.880 --> 19:05.758
We're not going anywhere.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.877
That's final.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.195
Please leave.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.836
She's not safe.
We're staying put.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.719
I got your text.
What's the emergency?

19:22.800 --> 19:24.519
Okay.
Listen to me very carefully.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.280
I took a break from
serial killer kidnapper madness

19:27.360 --> 19:29.591
to do something awesome.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.717
So I decided
on a new career path.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.280
Photography was always
my passion,

19:33.400 --> 19:34.696
and I figured why not
make it my job?

19:34.720 --> 19:36.154
These are great, Kamilla.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.038
I Peter Parker'd her.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.554
Dibs, sidebar.

19:39.640 --> 19:40.676
Sidebar?

19:40.760 --> 19:42.274
Sidebar, now!

19:44.520 --> 19:48.480
You have, uh...
Peter Parker'd her.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.029
Yeah, I mean,
Kamilla is a great photographer

19:51.120 --> 19:53.589
and I thought she could start
taking some pictures for Iris,

19:53.680 --> 19:55.776
and then maybe she'd start
to come around S.T.A.R. Labs.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.256
I don't know, if we're lucky,
get bitten

19:57.280 --> 19:59.158
by something radioactive.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.469
Become, like, a Spider-Person.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.995
So, while you thought,
did it occur to you

20:03.080 --> 20:05.640
that no one asked you
to do this?

20:07.240 --> 20:10.074
You don't think she'd make
a good Spider-Person?

20:10.160 --> 20:12.311
You listen to me
and you listen good,

20:12.400 --> 20:13.550
you turkey on stilts.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.233
It is not your job

20:15.320 --> 20:17.915
to get my girlfriend
on the team!

20:18.000 --> 20:20.435
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, you two!

20:20.520 --> 20:22.432
You guys are getting along
in there, I see that.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.193
What's going on?

20:24.280 --> 20:25.555
Your friend Iris was actually

20:25.640 --> 20:26.960
just giving me
a photography gig.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.397
Well, it's small,
but Kamilla has agreed to shoot

20:30.480 --> 20:33.393
the Fenway parade
for the <i>Citizen</i> this weekend.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.392
Shut the front door.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.279
That is unbelievable.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.113
Congrats.
That's amazing.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.590
Hey, why don't you and I go,
uh, drink and celebrate?

20:42.680 --> 20:44.911
Oh, sure.
Um, I will text you later.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.320
Yes, that sounds great.
Thank you.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.993
- You ready?
- Yeah.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.360
Well, well, well.

20:54.480 --> 20:58.793
<i>Bonjour,</i> Eobard Thawne.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.315
If I am Eobard Thawne,

21:01.400 --> 21:04.598
what kind of man am I?

21:04.680 --> 21:07.240
Patient, right?

21:07.320 --> 21:09.232
Master of science.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.516
But also...

21:14.040 --> 21:16.032
a master of...

21:18.640 --> 21:20.074
subterfuge.

21:20.160 --> 21:23.597
Because not only...

21:23.680 --> 21:25.353
am I...

21:25.440 --> 21:27.591
Eobard Thawne,

21:27.720 --> 21:31.191
but I'm also...

21:33.680 --> 21:36.514
Dr. Harrison Wells.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.879
And that man...

21:40.960 --> 21:44.317
that man would keep
his secrets...

21:47.600 --> 21:49.080
...close.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.832
What have we here?

21:56.040 --> 21:58.555
Well, well, well.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.439
<i>Bonjour.</i>

22:01.520 --> 22:04.797
How could Vickie not know
she killed two people?

22:04.880 --> 22:06.519
There was a time
in Central City

22:06.600 --> 22:09.069
where not all meta attacks
were public knowledge.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.038
Why not?
I mean, people should know...

22:11.120 --> 22:13.396
Former Mayor Bellows...

22:13.480 --> 22:15.400
...tried to keep certain things
out of the media.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.511
Said he didn't want
to create a panic.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.717
Turns out he had metas
on the payroll.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.075
Didn't want the heat.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.674
That's Cecile.
I'll be right back.

22:22.760 --> 22:23.830
Hey.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.114
You were wrong, you know.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.560
About what?

22:30.640 --> 22:32.296
About Vickie not wanting
to tell her family

22:32.320 --> 22:33.800
about her abilities.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.314
It's her choice
not to tell them.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.996
Look, keeping a secret
like that

22:39.080 --> 22:41.436
from her family is...
it's dangerous.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.751
I mean, they might get hurt
or worse.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.394
She's just trying
to protect them.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.996
I get that, I do, but...

22:49.080 --> 22:51.800
I-I used to think that keeping
secrets from people

22:51.880 --> 22:54.236
for their own good
was a noble decision,

22:54.320 --> 22:56.676
that it would protect them.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.576
But when you do that,
you just rob those people

22:58.600 --> 23:01.069
from making
their own decisions.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.198
I even did it with you.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.176
Like when you didn't want
to take me to your past.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.839
Mm-hmm.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.256
I didn't want you to see
how painful

23:09.280 --> 23:10.600
things got for me as the Flash

23:10.680 --> 23:13.400
or how bad things got
for your mom.

23:13.480 --> 23:17.076
But secrets
are like walls, and...

23:17.160 --> 23:19.240
you can't really know someone
with walls between you.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.395
Ah!

23:23.480 --> 23:25.437
Hey!

23:30.800 --> 23:32.154
Hey. Are you okay?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.760
I must have connected
to Grace's mind.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.069
She's coming.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.435
Grace is coming.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.397
I don't see Cicada anywhere.
Do you?

23:43.480 --> 23:45.358
It's the Flash!

23:45.440 --> 23:49.354
Mom, you got Flash and XS
cosplayers for the party?

23:49.440 --> 23:54.390
Yes, I am the Flash!
And I love...

23:54.480 --> 23:56.312
Soccer, do you guys
love soccer?

23:56.400 --> 23:58.357
Do you want to...
yeah, or... awesome!

23:58.440 --> 23:59.440
Come with me!

23:59.520 --> 24:00.896
Here, let's play some soccer
over here.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.696
This way. This way.
Come on, come on, come on.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.473
Help me with the kids.
Come on, come on!

24:04.560 --> 24:05.914
Far away from there.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.151
What's going on?
Cicada is coming here.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.799
- What?
- Now.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.394
We can move everyone else
out of here,

24:11.480 --> 24:13.240
but you and your family
have to come with me.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.396
All right.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.991
- Murderer.
- Grace, stop.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.440
She's innocent.
It was an accident.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.830
There are no accidents, Nora.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.116
Vickie?

24:38.680 --> 24:40.114
- We have to help Mom.
- Alice!

24:42.561 --> 24:43.994
Alice, no!

24:50.880 --> 24:52.951
Alice!

24:53.040 --> 24:55.157
My speed's back.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.640
We need to get them
out of here.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.555
I'll find you.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.636
I can't believe

25:15.720 --> 25:17.154
that little girl in there

25:17.240 --> 25:20.199
grows up to be
a time-traveling serial killer.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.317
Why can't we just wake her up
right now?

25:22.400 --> 25:24.790
We tried before.
It didn't work.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.456
What about the meta cure
y'all cooked up?

25:26.480 --> 25:28.119
We'd need Grace's consent.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.351
Besides, Caitlin says
that her condition

25:30.440 --> 25:31.999
is too fragile to even try.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.673
And I'm assuming
that destroying

25:33.800 --> 25:35.553
the time-traveling
hamster ball,

25:35.640 --> 25:37.199
that messes up the timeline?

25:37.280 --> 25:39.636
Yeah, it would probably
just make things even worse.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.313
- Oh, God!
- Whoa, what's wrong?

25:41.400 --> 25:42.550
Her mind.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.040
It's exactly the same
as the Cicada

25:44.120 --> 25:45.554
that attacked us
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

25:45.640 --> 25:49.998
Oh, my God, it's filled
with nothing but hatred.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.640
Nora found out
when she went into Grace's mind

25:52.720 --> 25:55.713
that Grace could hear Dwyer,
even in her coma...

25:55.800 --> 25:58.190
his anger, his rage.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.794
She was listening.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.314
She can carry out his words.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.119
Uh, hey, guys.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.317
Uh, Alice is back from the OR
and she's okay,

26:05.400 --> 26:08.074
but her parents are really not.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.039
<i>Vickie, I asked you to leave!</i>

26:11.120 --> 26:12.520
She's my daughter.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.593
No. I want my dad.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.320
Can't you see
that she's terrified of you?

26:17.400 --> 26:18.470
She could've been killed!

26:18.560 --> 26:20.074
I was trying
to protect you guys.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.436
By lying?
You're a meta, Vickie!

26:22.520 --> 26:24.955
A human time bomb!
How do you keep that from us?

26:25.040 --> 26:27.475
Mr. Bolen...
let's take a breath.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.040
Let's step outside.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.751
Hey, we did the right thing.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.150
We kept this family safe.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.469
Then why does it feel like

26:49.560 --> 26:53.031
we made everything
so much worse?

27:08.040 --> 27:09.240
Need any help with that, uh...

27:09.280 --> 27:10.350
Nope.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.936
Unless you came here
to break something,

27:11.960 --> 27:15.874
in which case
you'd be the perfect candidate.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.354
I deserve that.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.797
I never should've interfered
with Kamilla.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.440
Sometimes I forget how...

27:27.520 --> 27:29.637
embarrassing I can be.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.030
I'm not embarrassed by you,
and I'm not embarrassed

27:32.120 --> 27:33.679
by anyone on Team Flash.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.638
You guys are my family.
You're not the problem.

27:35.720 --> 27:39.350
This is the problem.
This is the problem.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.156
Kamilla is blissfully unaware

27:45.240 --> 27:48.199
of any of the madness
that goes on in S.T.A.R. Labs,

27:48.280 --> 27:51.671
or that we routinely save
the city from evil metas.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.296
Right, or that you have
a secret identity

27:53.320 --> 27:56.631
and dress up in leather
and go all pew-pew!

27:56.720 --> 27:59.155
Especially the leather.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.397
She and I,
we got a good thing.

28:01.480 --> 28:05.838
And being with somebody
has never felt so...

28:05.920 --> 28:07.673
so easy.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.433
And when I'm with her,
for once,

28:09.520 --> 28:11.989
I just feel like a normal dude,

28:12.080 --> 28:13.480
with a normal life

28:13.560 --> 28:15.950
and a social-media-official
girlfriend,

28:16.040 --> 28:18.953
who happens to be
a very talented photographer

28:19.040 --> 28:22.351
and not... a Spider-Person.

28:27.080 --> 28:31.518
It's... that's amazing, man.
It really is.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.832
And I promise
that I will respect that.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.717
But I gotta ask,
how long do you think

28:38.800 --> 28:42.350
you can keep
those two worlds separate?

28:42.440 --> 28:45.433
Look... my mom dated
this guy, Craig,

28:45.520 --> 28:49.070
and Craig was a tax accountant
and a freelance bull rider.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.879
Never let one world
know about the other,

28:50.960 --> 28:53.794
and... it just tore him up.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.553
More than those bulls ever did.

28:55.640 --> 28:58.155
Mm.
I should definitely be working.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.311
Look, the thing is,
I get why you're afraid

29:00.400 --> 29:02.232
of losing what you have
with Kamilla,

29:02.320 --> 29:05.472
but if you keep her out
of this world...

29:05.560 --> 29:06.994
it seems to me
that you're always

29:07.080 --> 29:10.596
gonna be turning off
a part of yourself.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.637
That's not right.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.096
And if Craig hadn't
been crushed to death

29:14.120 --> 29:16.954
by that huge filing cabinet...

29:17.040 --> 29:19.111
I know he'd feel the same way.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.512
I didn't get her.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.352
Well, maybe that's
a good thing,

29:44.440 --> 29:48.753
'cause I've read this file
and it doesn't make sense.

29:48.840 --> 29:53.517
Grace, there was no money
taken from the crime scene.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.195
I think what happened
to your mom and dad

29:56.280 --> 29:57.430
might've been an accident.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.638
She killed my parents,
Uncle Orlin!

30:00.720 --> 30:02.996
It wasn't an accident!

30:03.080 --> 30:05.356
You sound like them.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.558
Why do you sound like them?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.438
Grace, your head.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.273
We gotta get you to Dr. Ambres.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.874
She'll know how to help.

30:13.960 --> 30:17.476
She's not helping anyone.
Not anymore.

30:17.560 --> 30:19.597
Why not?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.037
I killed her.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.351
But Dr. Ambres
saved your life.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.999
And destroyed yours.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.878
You had a gift.

30:28.960 --> 30:33.432
An unbreakable weapon that fell
from the sky for you to use.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.711
For you to control.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.917
And she took that power
away from you.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.153
No, Grace.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.197
I wanted that cure.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.272
And I wanted you
to have it too.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.875
No. No, that's impossible.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.999
We were supposed
to do this together.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.754
Grace, I just wanted you
to be happy.

30:53.840 --> 30:57.595
That's all I ever wanted.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.479
I love you, Grace.
You're my family.

31:03.920 --> 31:07.596
And you'd do anything
to save me, right?

31:12.240 --> 31:14.675
I know what I have to do.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.160
Grace, stop.

31:19.280 --> 31:22.591
Grace, stop!
Grace, please!

31:36.680 --> 31:38.911
<i>Good evening, Dr. Wells.</i>

31:39.040 --> 31:40.633
<i>Bonjour,</i> Gideon.

31:40.720 --> 31:46.034
I believe I have something
that belongs...

31:46.120 --> 31:47.349
right here.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.319
<i>Video log, entry 247.</i>

31:50.400 --> 31:52.153
<i>I have long struggled</i>

31:52.240 --> 31:54.516
<i>with time's insistence
on change.</i>

31:54.640 --> 31:56.916
<i>One variable changes
the timeline.</i>

31:57.000 --> 32:00.198
<i>Our memories are changed too,
without any knowledge</i>

32:00.280 --> 32:04.479
<i>of time's other possibilities,
but not anymore.</i>

32:04.560 --> 32:06.472
Where he is going with this?

32:06.560 --> 32:09.155
<i>Just as the human body
is made up of DNA,</i>

32:09.280 --> 32:11.670
<i>so, too, is the multiverse
made up</i>

32:11.760 --> 32:14.639
<i>of its own unique source code.</i>

32:14.720 --> 32:17.155
- Hmm.
<i>- One that cannot be altered</i>

32:17.240 --> 32:18.674
<i>no matter what timeline
you're in,</i>

32:18.760 --> 32:20.194
<i>until now,</i>

32:20.280 --> 32:22.875
<i>because I have cracked
that code.</i>

32:23.000 --> 32:24.992
Oh.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.470
<i>And so the timeline,
may be malleable,</i>

32:27.560 --> 32:30.473
<i>but my knowledge...</i>

32:30.560 --> 32:32.119
<i>will be intractable.</i>

32:32.200 --> 32:34.431
Gideon, freeze video log.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.716
Capture the clear board.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.793
Run against handwriting sample
number two.

32:39.880 --> 32:43.396
The journal of Nora West-Allen.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.751
<i>Analysis complete...
handwriting match</i>

32:46.840 --> 32:48.399
<i>for Harrison Wells confirmed.</i>

32:48.480 --> 32:51.040
<i>Will that be all, Dr. Wells?</i>

32:51.120 --> 32:52.474
Yes, Gideon.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.913
That will be all.

33:01.120 --> 33:05.000
And that's why I didn't tell
you about my powers.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.073
I thought it would be
too hard for you.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.231
But you're tough.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.233
Tougher than I've ever been.

33:13.320 --> 33:17.234
So maybe you can be tough
for me too?

33:21.040 --> 33:24.033
They're a good family.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.237
Told you they'd figure it out.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.200
Dad...

33:31.960 --> 33:33.952
I need to tell you something.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.760
Oh, baby, what's wrong?

33:36.840 --> 33:38.069
Grace's mind.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.431
Oh, it's getting
so much stronger.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.350
She's here.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.315
Are you okay?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.751
Vickie Bolen!

34:16.840 --> 34:19.309
Give yourself over to me,

34:19.400 --> 34:21.357
or your husband dies.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.670
This Cicada doesn't care
if someone's a meta or not.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.399
She'll kill anyone
who stands in her way.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.596
XS, get her out of here

34:26.679 --> 34:27.856
before Cicada tries that again.

34:27.880 --> 34:28.916
Do not slow down.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.036
Detective, we need to get her
somewhere safe.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.120
Mom?

34:32.199 --> 34:33.255
I'm not leaving
without Alice.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.440
You're the target,
Mrs. Bolen.

34:34.520 --> 34:37.239
She's safer without you.
Come on, Alice, let's go.

34:37.320 --> 34:40.552
Come on, sweetie,
let's get you somewhere safe.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.751
XS, go!

34:50.480 --> 34:52.472
- What do you got?
- Well, we have a situation.

34:52.560 --> 34:53.789
Or two, actually.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.199
So that's the new Cicada,

34:55.320 --> 34:57.755
and that's the dagger
chasing Nora and Ms. Bolen.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.674
<i>- Guys, I need help!</i>
- Time to move.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.760
<i>Grace.</i>

35:01.840 --> 35:02.876
Let him go.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.176
I know you want revenge
for your parents, but...

35:08.200 --> 35:10.192
But it wasn't
that woman's fault.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.874
That doesn't change
that they're dead.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.872
Or that I became this.

35:16.960 --> 35:20.431
- We can help you.
- With your cure?

35:20.520 --> 35:23.831
There's only one cure
for this, Flash.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.593
Death.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.176
<i>Guys, I can't keep this up.</i>

35:29.200 --> 35:30.976
Nora, you need to hang on
for a little bit longer.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.856
- You're gonna turn on...
- The alleyway on Fuller.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.160
The alleyway on Fuller.
Be ready.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.435
<i>For what?</i>

35:50.520 --> 35:52.751
- Ooh, I am not loving that.
- Nope.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.520
Guys, we need you two
at the hospital.

35:57.560 --> 35:58.676
Let's go.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.536
- What the hell was that?
- Cisco, what happened?

36:07.560 --> 36:09.136
I don't know.
Something's wrong with my breach.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.560
We can't get through it!

36:10.640 --> 36:13.314
I've always wanted
to be up against the Flash

36:13.440 --> 36:15.750
and his legendary team.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.436
I guess I wasn't missing out
on anything after all.

36:19.520 --> 36:20.715
Grace!

36:21.880 --> 36:24.554
Don't do this.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.359
Please.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.955
This isn't the way to make
the world a better place.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.080
You hated them.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.953
I heard you.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.316
I was wrong.

36:36.400 --> 36:40.360
And that hate turned into
something even worse.

36:40.440 --> 36:43.956
<i>It was wrong to make you
feel that way, Gracie.</i>

36:44.040 --> 36:46.874
But you don't have to go down
the same path I did.

36:46.960 --> 36:51.000
You don't have to hold on
to this... this anger.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.232
Let it go.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.838
But my parents.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.832
It was an accident.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.789
Let it go.

37:09.880 --> 37:13.157
Before it's too late,
like it is for me.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.676
You're right, Uncle Orlin.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.800
Um...

37:24.360 --> 37:26.317
No!

37:30.920 --> 37:32.639
It is too late.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.800
Hey, hey, hey.

37:48.920 --> 37:52.550
Save my Gracie.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.872
I can't believe
she killed Dwyer.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.713
Yeah, as brutal as Dwyer was,

38:14.800 --> 38:16.176
his love for his niece
always kept him

38:16.200 --> 38:17.256
from crossing certain lines.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.919
Not Grace.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.515
No, and her powers
are incredibly dangerous.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.496
I ran some tests while I was at
the Tannhauser offsite...

38:23.520 --> 38:26.354
her dark matter has some sort
of binding quality.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.238
It allows her
to telekinetically manipulate

38:28.320 --> 38:30.915
dark matter
within a certain proximity.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.354
Including
the dark matter in us?

38:32.440 --> 38:33.440
I think so.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.319
I think what makes her powers
different from Dwyer's

38:36.400 --> 38:38.278
is that they came
from a wound in her head.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.760
That's why
she's so much stronger.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.957
How was Nora able to see
what Grace was seeing?

38:42.040 --> 38:44.271
Nora and Grace seem to be
psychically connected.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.556
I think it's because
of the time that Nora spent

38:46.640 --> 38:48.040
in Grace's brain.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.430
- Is there any sign of her?
- No.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.432
She definitely ghosted.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.874
What about Vickie
and her family?

38:53.960 --> 38:56.839
Uh, federal protection.
They're gonna be fine.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.515
They're getting new identities
as we speak.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.776
I don't know
about anyone else,

39:00.800 --> 39:02.359
but I could use a drink.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.477
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah, I'm in.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.517
- You want me to call a sitter?
- Yeah.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.796
Cisco, you want
to bring Kamilla?

39:11.320 --> 39:12.800
Not for this one.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.676
Nora, you coming?

39:18.760 --> 39:20.080
Nora.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.517
You want to tell us something,
don't you?

39:27.160 --> 39:29.914
She wants to tell you
her secret.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.673
Right?

39:32.760 --> 39:35.355
She doesn't know
where to start.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.080
Difficult to know
where to begin

39:38.160 --> 39:43.554
when your secret
threatens everything,

39:43.640 --> 39:44.676
everyone around you.

39:44.760 --> 39:45.989
Sherloque, stop it.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.833
Maybe start at the beginning.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.056
It's a very good place
to start.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.754
When you first time-traveled.

39:51.840 --> 39:55.993
<i>So careful to leave
the lightest footprint.</i>

39:56.120 --> 39:58.271
Until you suddenly
change course

39:58.360 --> 40:01.159
<i>and brazenly interfere
with the Thinker satellite</i>

40:01.240 --> 40:02.754
as it crashed to Earth.

40:02.840 --> 40:05.116
I think to myself,
"Nope, nope.

40:05.200 --> 40:11.151
This excessive action
doesn't make sense."

40:11.240 --> 40:14.517
Until you understand that...

40:14.640 --> 40:16.233
it wasn't your idea.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.359
Please stop.

40:20.440 --> 40:21.954
Someone instructed you
to do it.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.509
- Stop.
- Someone...

40:24.600 --> 40:27.877
<i>whose handwriting
is in yourjournal.</i>

40:27.960 --> 40:32.239
<i>Someone who wrote,
"The timeline is malleable."</i>

40:32.320 --> 40:35.836
<i>Same person who's been
directing you all this time,</i>

40:35.920 --> 40:38.719
making puppets of all of us

40:38.800 --> 40:40.678
as he seeks
to alter the timeline

40:40.760 --> 40:42.513
to suit his own purpose.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.118
Eobard Thawne.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.554
The Reverse-Flash.
Your teacher.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.155
Your partner.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.357
Your secret.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.473
Nora?

41:00.880 --> 41:03.076
Please tell us this isn't true.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.191
She can't.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.357
- Dad...
- Because it is true.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.956
Mom?

41:15.880 --> 41:17.837
I wanted to tell you.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.389
I-I tried to tell you.

41:24.600 --> 41:25.920
Dad.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.196
Dad, please!

41:28.800 --> 41:30.120
Dad!

41:30.760 --> 41:33.832
I'm sorry I lied to you!

41:39.120 --> 41:40.759
So am I.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.837
Dad...

42:22.840 --> 42:24.240
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
