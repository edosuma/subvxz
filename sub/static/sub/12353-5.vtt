00:00.030 --> 00:01.414
<i>My name is Marty Kaan</i>

00:01.434 --> 00:02.768
<i>and I'm a management</i>

00:02.802 --> 00:04.640
Are we billing
MetroCap for this?

00:04.710 --> 00:06.438
Duh.
Supermom.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.240
<i>You know, he still loves me,</i>

00:08.274 --> 00:10.007
even if I forget to love him.

00:10.060 --> 00:11.125
Marty Kaan?
Yeah.

00:11.151 --> 00:12.304
<i>Greg Norbert.</i>
<i>Greg Norbert.</i>

00:12.327 --> 00:13.546
Our part, in particular,
represents

00:13.578 --> 00:14.867
<i>a loss of his entire life.</i>

00:14.885 --> 00:17.062
I was squirting, Greg!

00:17.452 --> 00:19.386
I'm my own man!

00:21.554 --> 00:23.856
We're paying out the ass
for top-tier consulting firms,

00:23.890 --> 00:28.020
so why not acquire one?
You will be ours.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.829
He's gonna want to shove you
out without a parachute.

00:30.864 --> 00:31.830
And it's gonna be
a bumpy landing.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.161
Give me some cover on that...

00:33.200 --> 00:34.497
Why the fuck would I do that?

00:34.534 --> 00:37.036
<i>Still not sure exactly</i>
<i>what it is I do?</i>

00:37.070 --> 00:38.426
<i>Nah, you get it.</i>

00:38.458 --> 00:40.659
<i>I wouldn't dream of talking</i>
<i>down to you like that.</i>

00:47.514 --> 00:48.814
Fucking Utah.

00:50.169 --> 00:53.152
Three days in fucking Utah.

00:53.186 --> 00:55.320
Sinking your teeth
into the P&Ls

00:55.355 --> 00:58.557
of a budget motel chain...
that's gotta get your dick hard.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.492
They're all so
goddamn friendly.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.960
Which is bad?

01:01.995 --> 01:03.162
Yeah, because it's bullshit.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.462
Those are "fuck you" smiles.

01:04.497 --> 01:06.965
Or worse, it's some opening
gambit for them

01:07.000 --> 01:08.734
to brag about
their snowboarding prowess.

01:08.768 --> 01:10.569
They're always fresh
off the slopes.

01:10.603 --> 01:13.472
They're just dying to tell you
about some awesome encounter

01:13.506 --> 01:16.475
they had with a half pipe
or a powder run.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.578
Fucking Utah.

01:19.612 --> 01:22.214
Are you seriously
gonna make me say this?

01:22.248 --> 01:23.182
Say what?

01:23.216 --> 01:24.516
You're good.

01:24.551 --> 01:28.387
In a fight between
Greg Norbert and Marty Kaan,

01:28.421 --> 01:29.755
the smart money...

01:29.789 --> 01:32.591
all the fucking money...
is on you.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.127
Whatever comes of this
potential merger,

01:35.195 --> 01:37.372
you're good.

01:37.402 --> 01:38.588
I'm not concerned.

01:38.606 --> 01:39.731
Yeah, you just thought

01:39.766 --> 01:41.333
you'd plop yourself down there

01:41.401 --> 01:42.534
and bitch about Utah.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.205
I'm not concerned about
Metrocapital.

01:46.239 --> 01:47.272
You shouldn't be,

01:47.651 --> 01:49.952
because you are good.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.411
Unless you screw up.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.213
Then it's a whole new ballgame.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.283
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:58.318 --> 01:59.918
<i>once again, we are boarding</i>
<i>passengers...</i>

01:59.953 --> 02:03.222
The first Stay Rite was built in
1965 by Lester Butterfield

02:03.256 --> 02:04.723
as a no-frills alternative

02:04.757 --> 02:07.226
to the increasingly upscale
Holiday Inns.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.595
By the time he had
turned the reins over

02:09.628 --> 02:11.263
to his son Brant in 1990,

02:11.297 --> 02:13.192
Stay Rites were in 28 states.

02:13.247 --> 02:16.702
Under his son's leadership,
28 turns to 46.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.737
Now, I would rather blow
a dead donkey

02:18.771 --> 02:20.572
than stay in one
of these places,

02:20.640 --> 02:21.940
but they're undeniably
profitable.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.710
So then why are we there?

02:24.744 --> 02:26.879
My God, are you serious?

02:26.913 --> 02:29.081
Okay, fine, because
the new CFO wants

02:29.115 --> 02:31.583
to either boost revenues
and/or cut costs

02:31.613 --> 02:34.074
to prove to Brant Butterfield
that he chose wisely.

02:34.098 --> 02:35.208
Are you happy?

02:35.238 --> 02:37.696
- Yeah, you're not as blonde as you look.
- It's disgusting.

02:37.755 --> 02:40.426
You're overreacting!
So what, I don't scrub

02:40.450 --> 02:41.660
three-quarters
of the way up my elbow

02:41.694 --> 02:43.428
for 20 minutes the way you do.

02:43.463 --> 02:45.931
Doug, you didn't wash
your hands at all. So?

02:45.965 --> 02:49.419
This guy spends 15 excruciating
minutes in a stall, leaves

02:49.442 --> 02:52.471
the bathroom without giving
the sink a cursory glance.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.083
You did not just stick that
nasty hand in those olives.

02:55.094 --> 02:56.169
Are you nuts?

02:56.192 --> 02:57.176
Do you want one?

02:57.210 --> 02:58.177
Get out of here, fecal fingers.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.478
Put 'em on your side
of the table.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.579
Four shots of Patron, please.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.181
No, leave me out of that.

03:02.215 --> 03:03.515
Just a diet Coke, please.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.492
What? What am I doing?

03:06.536 --> 03:07.819
This isn't about me.
This is about you.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.121
You have bathroom issues.

03:09.155 --> 03:10.189
I don't have bathroom issues.

03:10.223 --> 03:11.590
Yeah, you do. You have
bathroom issues.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.891
Jeannie, you're really
gonna need something

03:12.926 --> 03:14.326
a little stiffer
than that, okay?

03:14.360 --> 03:17.429
Because for the next three days
we are knee-deep in Mormons.

03:19.142 --> 03:22.365
Optics: how things look
to the client.

03:22.672 --> 03:25.211
We are basically telling
companies to change the way

03:25.244 --> 03:26.712
they've been doing business
forever.

03:26.751 --> 03:28.240
And who the fuck are we?

03:28.308 --> 03:30.676
Just some people they met
a few days ago.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.278
All they have to go on is
what they can see.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.781
And what they need to see is
people

03:35.815 --> 03:37.182
who have their best interests
at heart.

03:37.638 --> 03:39.705
People who are just like them.

03:39.767 --> 03:44.022
Especially when we're selling
them a mountain of bullshit.

03:45.556 --> 03:47.785
Don't drink around these
people, okay?

03:47.829 --> 03:49.728
And do not fucking swear, okay?
I won't.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.997
If the subject of church
comes up, you share how

03:52.031 --> 03:53.365
your time in that youth group

03:53.399 --> 03:54.789
or music ministry changed
your life.

03:54.813 --> 03:55.968
It did.

03:56.011 --> 03:57.609
It the subject
of wives comes up,

03:57.648 --> 03:59.204
you can bet that my Medusa

03:59.239 --> 04:02.341
black hole ex-wife is gonna
be magically transformed

04:02.375 --> 04:03.775
into Suzie Fuckin' Homemaker.

04:05.044 --> 04:06.745
She is the wind beneath
my wings.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.013
She's the source of my strength.
Right.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.548
When in Rome, bitches!

04:11.351 --> 04:12.851
Four, four more.
No.

04:16.822 --> 04:19.958
The Butterfields have built an
excellent company,

04:19.993 --> 04:22.227
but the reason why I
brought you guys...

04:22.262 --> 04:24.162
You okay?
Yeah, just a little

04:24.197 --> 04:25.330
snowboarding thing
this weekend.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.732
Wait a minute.
Do you snowboard?

04:26.766 --> 04:27.933
I love snowboarding!

04:27.967 --> 04:29.868
Man, I was just up
at Mammoth Saturday.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.837
Cab seven over
a 20-foot tabletop.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.205
Wikipedia, motherfucker.

04:33.239 --> 04:34.539
I hit the flat hard.

04:34.574 --> 04:36.074
Like, oh!
Just bit it.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.110
Man, I have been there,
home slice

04:38.144 --> 04:40.612
- Hey, soldiers in the war, right?
- Tell me about it.

04:40.647 --> 04:43.582
And since hospitality is
our business,

04:43.616 --> 04:46.418
we have you set up in here.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.253
No way! Look at
this natural light!

04:48.288 --> 04:50.589
Look at those windows!

04:50.623 --> 04:51.723
Clementines?
Yeah.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.091
Sorry to interrupt, Paul,

04:53.126 --> 04:54.793
our call is starting, so...

04:54.827 --> 04:56.628
Okay. Everyone, this is
Rebecca Pfrommer.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.130
She's Stay Rite's
marketing prodigy.

04:58.164 --> 04:59.965
Well, I think "prodigy"
might be

04:59.999 --> 05:01.700
a little bit
of an overstatement.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.835
Okay, I'll say "genius."

05:03.870 --> 05:06.305
Client dinner tomorrow night,
and you and I are gonna share

05:06.339 --> 05:07.706
some war stories from
the slopes.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.007
That's a promise, buddy.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.245
That is a one
hot piece of Mormon ass.

05:13.279 --> 05:15.714
Guys, we all saw it,
so we can talk about it.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.482
She was smiling at me.

05:17.517 --> 05:18.684
She was smiling at all of us.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.053
At your faces, yes,

05:21.087 --> 05:23.689
but she was smiling at my cock.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.924
You really are a dickhead.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.125
I sure am.

05:28.795 --> 05:29.394
Rebecca! Hey.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.229
Hi.

05:31.264 --> 05:34.132
I didn't get a chance
to introduce myself before.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.000
I'm Clyde.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.335
Nice to meet you.

05:36.369 --> 05:38.537
Listen, I don't know
many people here in Utah,

05:38.571 --> 05:41.106
so I figured maybe you and I can
get a drink tonight.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.042
Well, I don't drink.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.045
All right, okay.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.515
But, I do eat dinner.

05:50.550 --> 05:55.087
My God! Guys,
these things are seedless.

05:55.121 --> 05:57.456
I'm not kidding! And there's
a purple one over there.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.858
My God, it's fruit.
Calm the fuck down.

05:59.892 --> 06:02.994
Well, heard you Galweather folks
were here giving my family's

06:03.062 --> 06:04.629
pride and joy
the once-over.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.898
I'm Brant Butterfield.
You must be Marty.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.667
God, no. I wish.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.936
Guys, I'm
straight on fire today.

06:10.970 --> 06:11.670
Marty.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.071
Clyde, actually.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.108
Marty Kaan.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.309
Nice to meet you.

06:17.343 --> 06:18.877
Of course.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.113
Well, I look forward
to working with you, Marty.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.080
Thank you, sir.

06:25.518 --> 06:29.521
So, Brant Butterfield. Racist?

06:29.555 --> 06:30.622
Why would you say that?

06:30.690 --> 06:32.457
Hates the color of your skin.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.793
So, listen, he's not gonna want
to hear a word out of my mouth

06:34.827 --> 06:36.762
except for the best way
to shine a shoe

06:36.796 --> 06:38.997
or the optimal way to load luggage
into a Pullman car, so...

06:39.031 --> 06:41.733
Marty, I can take it if you want.
Come on.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.735
He thought I was you first.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.337
You're gonna quarterback
this one, Jeannie.

06:45.371 --> 06:47.205
You want me to quarterback?
If you're up for it.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.407
Not even considering us.

06:48.441 --> 06:51.710
Yes, definitely.
I am up for it. Right.

06:51.744 --> 06:56.715
Listen, if you shit
the bed on this one,

06:56.749 --> 07:00.385
you are gonna get a
one-way ticket right back

07:00.420 --> 07:02.387
to whatever bumfuck
whistle-stop you came from

07:02.422 --> 07:05.023
and are working so hard to scrub
from your existence.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.191
We straight?

07:06.225 --> 07:09.194
Okay.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.496
Thanks for the support.
Doug, Clyde, I want you to see

07:11.531 --> 07:13.198
if there's a journey line
in their quarterlies.

07:13.232 --> 07:16.601
And Marty, I'm gonna need you to
get started on the brain dump.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.036
Have a good one, buddy.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.671
Thank you.

07:19.705 --> 07:22.407
I don't understand what
you're doing here, Monica.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.343
Well, Roscoe said that you had

07:25.378 --> 07:27.078
a funeral in Sacramento.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.448
So, after I overcame
my initial disappointment

07:29.482 --> 07:31.349
and shock that it wasn't yours,

07:31.384 --> 07:35.287
I decided to clear my schedule.

07:35.321 --> 07:37.889
Well, we have a lovely lady
coming to take care of Roscoe.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.191
She'll be here any minute.

07:39.225 --> 07:40.792
Actually, she won't.

07:40.827 --> 07:44.095
What do you want?

07:44.163 --> 07:47.199
My trip to Fiji got cancelled
last-minute,

07:47.233 --> 07:49.000
so I decided, "What the hell?"

07:49.035 --> 07:50.101
You didn't answer my question.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.369
You know, I figured out

07:51.404 --> 07:53.638
why it is
you hate me so much, Jeremiah.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.173
'Cause you're toying
with my son,

07:55.208 --> 07:56.808
you ignore yours.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.077
And you are the perfect poster
girl for narcissism.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.847
It's because you want
to fuck me.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.216
Roscoe!

08:04.250 --> 08:06.284
Your mother's here!

08:06.319 --> 08:08.753
You don't associate
Utah with sushi,

08:08.788 --> 08:10.989
but honestly,
it was pretty decent.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.791
Although, Rebecca ordered
the tempura,

08:12.825 --> 08:14.826
which is obviously
a turn-off, but...

08:14.861 --> 08:16.561
Who cares?
Did you get in her pants?

08:16.596 --> 08:19.397
Doug Guggenheim,
I got in her shirt.

08:20.466 --> 08:22.300
That's not a thing.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.236
It's definitely a thing.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.904
It's not a thing.
Not when you're a grown-up.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.439
She's a devout Mormon,
which means

08:27.473 --> 08:29.274
she doesn't do this.
She's a virgin.

08:29.308 --> 08:32.510
Wait a minute. Actual virgin
or technical virgin?

08:32.544 --> 08:34.044
What does that even mean?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.081
Rear entry is

08:36.115 --> 08:39.751
a very common practice
for women who want to keep

08:39.784 --> 08:42.320
their, temple pristine.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.587
And you know this how?

08:43.623 --> 08:44.623
Trust me. I know.

08:44.657 --> 08:46.625
You've never had anal.

08:46.659 --> 08:47.626
I've had anal.

08:47.660 --> 08:48.660
Receiving doesn't count, Doug.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.628
Come on!

08:49.662 --> 08:51.029
Jeannie!

08:51.063 --> 08:51.930
Boom.
Boom?

08:51.964 --> 08:53.365
Presuming you're right,

08:53.399 --> 08:55.433
which I'm not,
but presuming you are...

08:55.468 --> 08:58.203
how do you even broach the
subject? Like, what do you say?

08:58.237 --> 09:00.105
Yeah.

09:00.139 --> 09:03.041
"God, I want to be
inside you so much, girl.

09:03.075 --> 09:05.443
No. I just wish there
were some way around

09:05.478 --> 09:08.380
them... pesky rules.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.682
And you have to say it like
a '90s R&B singer with a lisp?

09:10.716 --> 09:12.450
Don't have to.
But it helps.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.619
Do you know what would work for me?
What?

09:14.654 --> 09:17.289
If we shared a really
good bottle of wine,

09:17.323 --> 09:21.459
and then,
he kissed me gently

09:21.494 --> 09:23.161
but soulfully.
Of course.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.996
And... kind of

09:25.064 --> 09:26.865
caressed my hair, and then

09:26.899 --> 09:29.200
whispered sweetly,

09:29.268 --> 09:33.004
"I would really love
your feces on my dick."

09:33.039 --> 09:35.907
Do you get...
now you got feces on your dick?

09:35.942 --> 09:37.876
Come on, she's messing
with your head, dude.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.078
My people:

09:40.112 --> 09:42.147
It turns out we are not
consulting for Stay Rite.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.149
No, no. We have stumbled
into the corporate offices

09:44.183 --> 09:45.584
of Shangri-goddamn-La.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.686
They should change the sign.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.988
The employees are thrilled
to be working here.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.423
And the customers...

09:51.457 --> 09:53.425
A couple months back,
a businessman came to stay

09:53.459 --> 09:55.493
right here at the Stay Rite
in Salt Lake City.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.529
Found it overbooked.

09:57.563 --> 10:00.231
So the CEO offers him
a room in his house.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.299
No. What? Yeah.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.968
Cooks him waffles
in the morning.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.202
Who the fuck are these people?

10:04.236 --> 10:06.371
Well, it gets worse.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.406
They are in amazing shape
financially.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.808
I-I can't fault them.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.242
They've got the best
KPIs I've ever seen.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.611
So we're screwed.
We're not screwed.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.513
Well, let's not...
I got this, okay? It...

10:15.548 --> 10:17.382
There's a crack somewhere.
There's always a crack,

10:17.416 --> 10:19.618
and I'll find it. I've looked.
Jeannie, I've looked.

10:19.652 --> 10:20.603
There's no crack.

10:20.604 --> 10:21.553
What if there's not a crack?
Then we'll get

10:21.587 --> 10:23.421
a fucking sledgehammer,
Doug, and make one.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.529
So how come you
didn't go to Fiji?

10:31.564 --> 10:33.932
Because the dickhead
that I'm dating

10:33.966 --> 10:36.201
decided to take
his ugly wife instead.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.003
You shouldn't say "dickhead."

10:38.037 --> 10:39.738
Yeah, well, he shouldn't be one.

10:39.772 --> 10:42.340
I listen to him
rattle on and on and on

10:42.375 --> 10:44.743
about how even though he makes
hundreds of millions of dollars,

10:44.777 --> 10:46.945
he just can't live up to his
daddy's expectations of him.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.315
I arrange an internship

10:50.349 --> 10:52.183
for his fat as fuck daughter.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.786
I even let him f...

10:54.820 --> 10:56.488
Do you know what
a "golden shower" is?

10:56.522 --> 10:57.989
When it's sunny and it rains?

10:58.024 --> 11:00.125
That's magical.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.560
I earned that trip to Fiji.

11:05.264 --> 11:08.266
First-class airfare,
cost of that villa,

11:08.300 --> 11:11.169
food... oh, the incidentals.

11:11.203 --> 11:15.173
We are talking about,
I don't know... roughly $16,000.

11:15.207 --> 11:18.276
And that is
a conservative monetization.

11:18.310 --> 11:21.212
Still, breaking into
his house and stealing?

11:21.247 --> 11:23.982
Appropriating
replacement value, sweetie.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.819
And it is not breaking in
when you have the pass code.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.654
See?

11:34.060 --> 11:35.427
I mean, normally I wouldn't do

11:35.461 --> 11:37.128
a backside rodeo on
a dry slope, but...

11:37.163 --> 11:38.496
But you're a complete airdog.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.497
Guilty.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.436
Hey, so, listen, I've heard some
rumblings about Metrocapital...

11:44.470 --> 11:46.171
Well, you've
done your homework.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.605
But you've probably also heard

11:47.640 --> 11:49.374
that that whole merger's
effectively DOA.

11:49.408 --> 11:50.809
No, I hadn't.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.711
But great. Good.

11:52.745 --> 11:54.612
When I was a kid,
we went to Spain.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.047
It was incredible.
I love Spain.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.882
Really?
The beaches, the museums,

11:57.917 --> 12:00.351
the people... they're called
Spaniels, right?

12:02.488 --> 12:05.023
You are so cute.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.225
It's my gift...
my curse.

12:07.259 --> 12:11.463
You know, you might even
get lucky tonight.

12:11.497 --> 12:14.265
What? When you say "lucky,"
what does that mean?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.434
Well...

12:23.943 --> 12:25.643
It's pomegranate juice.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.746
Helps lower the cholesterol level.
You know what?

12:27.780 --> 12:30.648
I also have concerns
about my arterial health.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.358
Somebody's been
a bad little Mormon.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.395
I'm not actually Mormon.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.199
Although I may have led
Brant to believe that I am.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.201
You sly motherfucker.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.536
I might even be Jewish.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.276
I'm sure Brant loves
the Chosen People.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.811
You know, you'd be
surprised how often

12:59.879 --> 13:01.513
someone's trying to
jew him on the price.

13:01.547 --> 13:02.914
Shit!

13:02.948 --> 13:04.282
<i>L'chaim!</i>

13:06.218 --> 13:08.486
Well, we're still sifting through the
data, but we have some initial thoughts.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.523
A good starting-off point would
be to segment your customer base.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.591
We actually tried that
about two years ago.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.026
It ended up being a,

13:15.094 --> 13:16.761
waste of time.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.897
There's a lot of opportunity
for re-targeting online...

13:18.931 --> 13:21.099
Yeah, we tried it.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.701
A lot of travel
industry businesses

13:23.736 --> 13:25.703
find success with
loyalty programs.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.305
Which you've tried.
Obviously.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.707
Yeah. Excuse me
one sec, will you?

13:33.612 --> 13:35.113
I knew it; I knew it!
What'd I tell you?

13:35.147 --> 13:36.714
Are you pumped?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.883
Are you kidding me?
I'm about to go nuts on that.

13:38.918 --> 13:40.118
Right?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.053
Damn, big meal, too.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.389
That should
make things fun tonight.

13:44.423 --> 13:45.957
What does that even...
what does that mean?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.225
Nothing. Doesn't
mean anything.

13:47.259 --> 13:48.893
Forget I said anything.
Yeah.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.128
My God...
<i>and</i> corn?

13:50.162 --> 13:52.597
You know what
they say about corn.

13:52.631 --> 13:54.732
No.
You never really own it,

13:54.767 --> 13:57.135
you just borrow it.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.337
Shut up, Doug. You don't know
what you're talking about.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.541
That's it, good girl,
get every last kernel.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.214
Well, good luck.
Yep.

14:09.248 --> 14:12.016
Hey, hey. You want
to get out of here?

14:12.051 --> 14:14.185
And get into some fun?
No, I want to stay here.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.453
Okay.
Yeah.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.121
Jeanie, the CFO and I

14:17.156 --> 14:20.091
are gonna go, talk
strategy. You got this?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.759
Yeah. I'm making inroads.
Cool.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.362
You don't want dessert?

14:24.396 --> 14:27.165
Fuckity fuck fuck fuck.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.805
I think I found something.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.173
De la Renta couture.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.108
Nice.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.676
You look amazing, Mom.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.678
Come here.

14:42.681 --> 14:45.283
We still have a pretty
big chunk of change left.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.085
Any thoughts?

14:47.119 --> 14:50.989
Well, I did see some sweet Jimmy
Choo ankle boots in the closet.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.458
But they're only,
like, $800 tops.

14:53.492 --> 14:54.659
Yeah, that's not enough.

14:54.693 --> 14:56.561
I'm thinking art.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.496
There's this Egon Schiele

14:58.530 --> 15:01.266
he was always bragging about,
like he painted it himself.

15:02.701 --> 15:07.005
If I was a Schiele,
where would I be?

15:10.242 --> 15:12.110
Well, are you coming or not?

15:12.144 --> 15:14.712
Let's go!

15:19.551 --> 15:21.419
Hey...

15:21.453 --> 15:23.488
Hey, do you think
Clyde is in yet?

15:23.522 --> 15:25.723
I cannot tell you how
little I feel like

15:25.758 --> 15:28.559
discussing Clyde having
anal sex right now.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.363
No, I bet he's in.
Yeah.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.831
Yeah, definitely.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.433
What if it expands?

15:35.467 --> 15:37.101
I mean, it would have to, right?

15:37.136 --> 15:40.838
How else do you...?
The company. What if...

15:40.873 --> 15:44.075
they launch a new brand of
boutique motels that offers

15:44.109 --> 15:46.477
the competitive pricing
that Stay Rite is known for,

15:46.512 --> 15:48.846
but appeals to
a higher-end market?

15:48.881 --> 15:51.849
Okay. Yeah. I'll start
working the numbers.

15:53.000 --> 15:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:01.327 --> 16:02.860
Is everything okay?

16:02.895 --> 16:06.364
Everything is amazing.

16:08.567 --> 16:09.968
I just have to
use the bathroom first.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.405
You have corn...
in your teeth.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.808
No... That won't do it,
'cause there's a ton of it.

16:16.842 --> 16:18.576
Stop it.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.380
Don't go anywhere
while I'm gone, okay?

16:22.414 --> 16:24.582
Why would I go anywhere? You
gonna be in there for a while?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.288
You are funny.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.326
You didn't answer the question.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.192
I can't do this.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.762
Nope. Nope, can't do this.

17:10.796 --> 17:12.763
I'm not gonna fuck a shitty ass.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.333
No. No way. No way.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.939
Schiele is considered

17:21.973 --> 17:24.575
one of the early champions
of Expressionism.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.444
What do you think?

17:26.478 --> 17:27.878
It's kind of creepy.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.949
Yeah, okay, yeah, I could see

17:31.984 --> 17:34.585
how you see disturbing, right?

17:34.620 --> 17:37.355
Maybe even a little grotesque.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.990
But...

17:39.024 --> 17:40.958
I mean, there's-there's
still some beauty in there.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.361
Isn't there?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.364
Yeah.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.766
Yeah.

17:50.669 --> 17:53.371
So, I'm going to go to bed.
Why?

17:53.405 --> 17:56.240
It's 3:00 in the morning,
and I have school today.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.575
You can skip.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.577
I am not going to tell anybody.

17:59.611 --> 18:01.279
Good night, Mom.
No, don't go.

18:01.313 --> 18:03.815
Baby...

18:16.795 --> 18:18.529
What do you think
about Special K?

18:18.564 --> 18:19.997
It's not the breakfast cereal.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.033
It's got a little
more kick?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.670
What?

18:27.473 --> 18:30.508
I don't know what you're saying.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.219
I'll be right back.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.727
That's it?

18:49.761 --> 18:51.395
Are you kidding me?

18:51.430 --> 18:53.764
There is no way this company
changes its true north

18:53.832 --> 18:56.033
for, at best, a marginal gain
in profits.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.568
Jeannie, no fucking way.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.270
Marty, I can...
No fucking way.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.738
I can get the buy-in, Marty.

19:00.772 --> 19:02.306
Trust me, I can get it.
Yeah, you know what?

19:02.341 --> 19:04.275
I can get it.
Your cheerleader pluck,

19:04.309 --> 19:05.710
it's very adorable,

19:05.744 --> 19:07.879
and it will quite likely create

19:07.913 --> 19:11.048
a lasting image in
Brant Butterfield's spank bank,

19:11.083 --> 19:14.285
but you present him with a
brand extension strategy,

19:14.319 --> 19:16.454
Jeannie, he will shake
your hand,

19:16.488 --> 19:19.991
give you one long last look
to lock in that mental picture,

19:20.025 --> 19:22.126
and then you're out of there.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.762
Thank you for your time.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.430
I can up the danger factor.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.533
I can tweak the PowerPoint.
I... Listen. Yeah, yeah.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.568
I'm talking... yeah, I'm talking.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.403
You're not hearing me.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.939
I know you came all the way
out here for Daddy

19:34.973 --> 19:37.108
to give you a,
"Atta girl, cupcake,"

19:37.142 --> 19:39.644
but Daddy ain't giving you that,
'cause this is shit.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.879
Now, you got...

19:43.916 --> 19:45.750
Okay, you don't have
a lot of time

19:45.784 --> 19:48.119
before the big show,
so I suggest

19:48.153 --> 19:50.688
you don't waste time
standing around

19:50.722 --> 19:54.292
looking like you're about
to fucking cry.

19:58.163 --> 19:59.697
Whoa, what are you doing now?

19:59.731 --> 20:01.098
You got to taste this.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.700
Okay.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.902
I'll taste mine.

20:08.807 --> 20:12.009
So I have to be at
school in 20 minutes.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.322
I can call a cab.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.864
I got about 51 seconds sleep
last night,

20:33.899 --> 20:35.533
and there is not a coffee pot

20:35.567 --> 20:36.901
in this entire place.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.135
Yeah, well, Mormons
don't do coffee.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.537
That's right.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.871
You should have gotten one
from the hotel.

20:40.939 --> 20:42.173
Thank you.

20:42.207 --> 20:43.708
Don't drink all of it.

20:43.742 --> 20:46.010
What is that, hazelnut?
God... Great.

20:46.044 --> 20:47.245
Jeannie?
Yeah?

20:47.279 --> 20:48.512
You stuck with brand extension?

20:48.547 --> 20:49.747
Yes. No guts,
no glory, right?

20:49.781 --> 20:51.315
Right. Yeah.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.884
Hey, it's been a pleasure
working with you, so...

20:53.919 --> 20:55.586
Yep.
Yeah. Stay in touch.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.555
Dead man walking!

21:03.595 --> 21:05.496
Hey, Rebecca.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.498
Hey, Rebecca.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.033
Hey.

21:09.067 --> 21:12.036
Did you seriously
not fuck her in the ass?

21:12.070 --> 21:14.338
You are such a pussy.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.574
Demographic
and psychographic shifts

21:16.608 --> 21:18.376
in the Gen X and Millennials

21:18.410 --> 21:20.578
have turned them into LOCs...

21:20.612 --> 21:22.380
luxury-oriented consumers.

21:22.414 --> 21:25.182
They're not rich,
but they want to feel rich.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.185
And when they travel, they want
to see flat-screen TVs.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.187
They want to see modern furniture.
Glass shower doors,

21:30.222 --> 21:31.989
granite countertops.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.527
If we don't proact

21:36.561 --> 21:38.896
by aggressively expanding
into new brands,

21:38.930 --> 21:43.634
you're looking at receivership
and possibly bankruptcy.

21:43.669 --> 21:46.604
That's a bit alarmist,
don't you think?

21:50.542 --> 21:52.043
Excuse me.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.278
Got a hair ball, kitty?

21:54.313 --> 21:55.813
Sorry. Am I wrong here?

21:57.015 --> 21:58.649
When I was nine years old,

21:58.684 --> 22:00.451
my dad gave me
a Polaroid camera...

22:00.485 --> 22:02.053
roughly around
the same time your dad

22:02.087 --> 22:03.654
gave you this fine company
to run...

22:03.689 --> 22:05.823
and I loved that thing.

22:05.857 --> 22:08.459
I must have taken
1,000 pictures with it.

22:08.493 --> 22:12.229
Polaroid sold its first
instant camera in 1948,

22:12.264 --> 22:17.335
and at its peak in 1978,
they sold 13 million units.

22:17.369 --> 22:22.073
And in 2001,
they filed Chapter 11.

22:22.107 --> 22:25.476
They made a very
common mistake.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.511
They thought the past
was the future.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.480
Now, maybe what we're
prescribing is alarmist,

22:29.514 --> 22:32.249
but maybe, if someone
had sounded the alarm

22:32.284 --> 22:34.151
at Polaroid 15 years ago,

22:34.186 --> 22:36.987
my camera wouldn't be sitting
in a closet collecting dust

22:37.022 --> 22:38.856
'cause they don't make film
for it anymore.

22:43.228 --> 22:45.296
It's a big shift.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.331
Not as big as watching a series
of wrecking balls

22:47.366 --> 22:49.166
lay waste
to your father's legacy.

22:51.803 --> 22:53.771
Timber.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.341
Okay, let's do this.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.112
Kitty.

23:01.146 --> 23:02.613
Who's got the big dick now?

23:02.647 --> 23:03.848
Actually,

23:03.882 --> 23:05.182
hang on a second.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.084
That number seems off to me.

23:12.624 --> 23:15.292
The most dreaded words
a consultant can hear.

23:15.327 --> 23:18.162
One bad number throws
all your numbers into question.

23:18.196 --> 23:20.698
Everything up to that point
doesn't matter.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.067
All the client can see
is an incompetent boob

23:23.101 --> 23:26.170
with 40 PowerPoint pages
full of garbage.

23:26.204 --> 23:28.005
That spending figure
strikes me as high.

23:28.039 --> 23:29.807
Where... where did you get that?

23:29.841 --> 23:31.308
I...

23:33.211 --> 23:34.712
That's FCA.

23:37.682 --> 23:40.251
From Calvin's ass.

23:40.285 --> 23:45.055
Calvin Sobel is something
of a consulting legend.

23:45.123 --> 23:46.624
The term's an homage,

23:46.658 --> 23:49.560
and when uttered
with absolute certainty,

23:49.594 --> 23:52.096
it is a surprisingly
effective answer to,

23:52.130 --> 23:54.231
"Where'd you get that number?"

23:57.135 --> 23:58.669
It's also FMA.

23:58.737 --> 24:01.572
From my ass.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.340
You want to take
a look at these?

24:03.375 --> 24:04.942
Please.

24:10.382 --> 24:12.550
Hey, Marty, don't you also
have those documents

24:12.584 --> 24:16.353
from the White House's
Special K Commission?

24:16.388 --> 24:17.455
The what?

24:17.489 --> 24:18.823
They are in there.

24:18.857 --> 24:20.124
You should maybe check those

24:20.158 --> 24:22.059
just to make sure
that everything is,

24:22.093 --> 24:24.028
uh... kosher.

24:24.062 --> 24:26.564
I feel good about that number.

24:30.402 --> 24:31.702
What about you, Jeannie?

24:31.736 --> 24:33.771
You... you like
these numbers?

24:35.674 --> 24:37.641
Give me a fucking break.

24:37.676 --> 24:41.579
Yes, sir, I have those
same numbers right here.

24:41.613 --> 24:43.447
I'm-I'm sorry for interrupting,
Mr. Butterfield.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.382
Sometimes I just
don't know my place.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.784
It's not a problem, son.

24:59.464 --> 25:01.232
Doug.

25:01.266 --> 25:02.733
Can I sit here for a second?

25:02.767 --> 25:04.001
Yeah.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.503
Yeah, yeah.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.410
Hey.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.313
I'm sorry.
Were you asleep?

25:17.449 --> 25:19.617
Is there a problem?

25:21.987 --> 25:24.788
You know you came this close
to dicking us over out there?

25:24.823 --> 25:27.825
I know I scored us
six months of afterwork.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.529
You know, with this
potential merger coming up,

25:31.563 --> 25:33.731
all of our asses
are on the line?

25:33.765 --> 25:35.933
You understand that?

25:35.967 --> 25:37.468
Wasn't a rhetorical question,
baby doll.

25:37.502 --> 25:38.669
Do you understand that?

25:38.703 --> 25:40.771
Yes, I understand.

25:40.805 --> 25:42.706
And I also realize

25:42.741 --> 25:44.275
that that bad number
might have sunk us.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.744
You're goddamn right.
But the only reason

25:46.778 --> 25:49.079
that our asses are
on the line, Marty,

25:49.114 --> 25:50.614
is because of you.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.317
Because you have
so little control

25:53.351 --> 25:54.952
over your behavior.

25:54.986 --> 25:57.521
Because you could not resist

25:57.556 --> 25:59.557
slapping around
Greg Norbert's manhood,

25:59.591 --> 26:01.325
such as it is.

26:01.359 --> 26:03.460
You are the only reason

26:03.495 --> 26:05.930
that this potential
merger exists.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.998
And by the way, please,
let's stop kidding ourselves...

26:08.033 --> 26:10.568
it's not a merger,
it's a goddamn acquisition.

26:10.602 --> 26:13.137
Now... now, here comes
the fun part for me.

26:13.171 --> 26:14.672
Whether I like it or not,

26:14.706 --> 26:16.407
my fortunes are tied to yours.

26:16.441 --> 26:19.176
Which means I'm also
in the crosshairs.

26:19.210 --> 26:22.212
Which means you dicked me over,
asshole.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.480
Okay?

26:25.884 --> 26:27.084
And you know what?

26:27.118 --> 26:28.719
Another thing.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.855
I might possibly be
the last person on the planet

26:31.890 --> 26:33.724
who has known you longer
than five minutes

26:33.758 --> 26:36.193
and actually likes you,
and all you do is shit on me.

26:37.729 --> 26:39.096
So you know what?

26:39.130 --> 26:41.098
Fuck you.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.832
What's up?

27:17.235 --> 27:18.736
You all right?
