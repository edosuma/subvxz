00:57.640 --> 00:59.267
[Doc reading]

00:59.768 --> 01:03.688
Pardon me, Ms. Lambie,
would you care
for some more tea?

01:03.772 --> 01:06.649
Oh, some more tea
would be so very lovely.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.319
[Donny] Doc, where are you?

01:09.402 --> 01:11.196
Donny's home
from the arcade.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.697
You'd better go stuffed.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.743
Check out the toy
I won at the arcade!

01:16.826 --> 01:17.994
His name is Bronty.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.413
He's so big, it's awesome.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.123
Watch him stomp around.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.500
Stomp, stomp, stomp!

01:23.583 --> 01:24.417
[giggles]

01:24.501 --> 01:26.753
You can stomp
with Bronty later,
young man.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.631
You spilled juice
all over yourself
at the arcade.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.466
Let's get you
into the bath.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.845
Thanks.
You can play with him
if you want.

01:36.471 --> 01:41.935
Look! I'm Bronty.
Stomp, stomp, stomp!

01:42.018 --> 01:44.145
Roar!

01:47.440 --> 01:48.399
Oh!

01:49.818 --> 01:53.196
Whoa! Hi, Bronty,
I'm Doc McStuffins.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.031
Hi, Doc.
Hi, Doc.
Hi, Doc.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.118
And I'm Lambie.
Would you like to
join our tea party?

01:58.201 --> 02:01.329
Ooh! Please!
It sure looks like fun!

02:01.412 --> 02:03.832
Whoa! Bronty,
you spilled our tea.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

02:06.084 --> 02:10.255
Um, Bronty, maybe tea party
isn't the best game for you.

02:10.672 --> 02:15.802
You're so big
and the table's so small.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.762
Why don't we go outside
to play?

02:17.846 --> 02:21.516
Oh! Outside!
Ooh! That sounds like fun.
Yeah. Let's go. Let's go!

02:29.149 --> 02:30.024
[squeak]

02:30.108 --> 02:31.192
Whoa!
[laughs]

02:31.568 --> 02:32.402
[laughs]

02:32.861 --> 02:34.654
Hey, Doc!
Hi, everyone.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.615
I want you all to meet
Donny's new toy, Bronty.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.701
Like, what's up, Bronty?

02:39.784 --> 02:43.163
Oh, wow! It's great to meet
so many new toys!

02:43.246 --> 02:46.166
Oh, can we be friends?
Can we? Can we? Please?

02:46.249 --> 02:47.458
You betcha.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.044
Dinosaurs and dragons
are lots alike.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.171
You're almost like cousins.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.048
Cousins? Oh!

02:54.299 --> 02:55.174
Aah!

02:56.801 --> 02:58.553
[chuckles]
Nice catch, Doc.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.056
Hey, cuz!
Oh, this is so great.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.559
It's like
we're... family.

03:04.976 --> 03:09.147
Well, sure, except,
of course, that dragons
have way cool wings.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.481
No way!

03:10.857 --> 03:12.150
You can fly?

03:12.442 --> 03:14.402
Oh, can I see you fly?
Fly now.

03:14.485 --> 03:19.532
Well, I can't exactly
fly, but, um... Hey!
Who wants to play catch?

03:19.824 --> 03:22.785
Oh, me! Oh, yes!
Can we play catch now?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.495
Can we? Can we? Can we?

03:24.579 --> 03:26.164
Sure. Here, catch.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.293
Ooh!
[squeak]

03:33.922 --> 03:35.715
Stuffy, over here!

03:38.134 --> 03:41.012
Bronty certainly has
more room to run around.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.640
Doc, I wanted
to talk to you
about my nose.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.892
I mean, my carrot.
I mean, my nose.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.770
Sure, Chilly.
Let's go into the clinic.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.105
[chuckling]

03:57.111 --> 03:58.529
The Doc is in.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.198
[chuckling]

04:04.327 --> 04:05.245
Aah!

04:10.041 --> 04:11.417
Whoa!

04:11.960 --> 04:14.462
Like, careful there,
dino dude.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.632
Oh, sorry.
Oh, throw it.
Throw it!

04:22.053 --> 04:23.263
[Stuffy] Uh!

04:25.974 --> 04:28.893
Sorry.
Oh, throw it, Stuffy!
Throw it! Throw it!

04:28.977 --> 04:30.561
[groans]

04:30.645 --> 04:33.106
I think I'm gonna
take a little break.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.024
So don't worry, Chilly.

04:35.108 --> 04:39.070
It's perfectly normal
for a snowman to have
a carrot for a nose.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.196
Thanks, Doc.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.783
Stuffy! What's wrong?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.160
You look all squished.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.622
I got a boo-boo.
I think I need a check-up.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.207
Aww.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.752
Hey! I caught it. Oof!

04:57.171 --> 04:58.965
Your heart sounds okay.
[heartbeat]

04:59.048 --> 05:01.050
Now, can you take
a deep breath for me?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.176
[inhales]

05:02.260 --> 05:04.304
Ow!
Ooh! Did I hurt you?

05:04.679 --> 05:05.596
A little.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.640
Does it hurt
anywhere else?

05:08.057 --> 05:12.770
It hurts here, here, here,
here, here, here, and here.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.355
Oh! And here.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.149
Oh, sweet sugar lumps!

05:16.232 --> 05:18.568
You're a whole bushel
full of boo-boos.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.403
When did the ouchies start?

05:20.778 --> 05:23.489
Well, it started
when Bronty flung me
in the air,

05:23.573 --> 05:25.616
then he jumped
and landed on me.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.785
[both]
Bronty landed on you?

05:29.037 --> 05:32.832
Hallie, get the
<span style="style.default_1">Big Book of Boo-Boos.</span>
I have a diagnosis.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.335
What's Stuffy got, Doc?

05:36.419 --> 05:40.339
Stuffy has a severe case
of bronto boo-boos.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.550
And I have
the perfect treatment.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.135
Well, what is it?

05:44.218 --> 05:47.972
What you need
is a kiss and a cuddle.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.265
[kiss]

05:49.348 --> 05:50.558
[chuckling]

05:50.641 --> 05:54.312
You're right, Doc.
That does make me
feel better.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.191
Lambie, perfect timing.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.860
I could use the help
of an expert cuddler.

06:01.277 --> 06:04.280
Oh, my arm might be
too sore for cuddling.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.824
Bronty banged it
when he bumped into me.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.035
I'm sure Bronty
didn't mean it.

06:09.118 --> 06:09.952
I know.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.664
But he's just so big
that he doesn't know
he's playing rough.

06:13.998 --> 06:14.999
[kiss]

06:15.833 --> 06:17.335
[giggling]
Uh-oh!

06:17.877 --> 06:20.588
I think you got
a heaping helping
of new patients.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.883

a lot of check-ups to do.

of bronto boo-boos.

Lambie, I think
I'm gonna need
your help here.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.215
Lots of kissing
and cuddling to do.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.885
Don't worry, Doc.
I'm your lamb. [giggles]

07:07.969 --> 07:09.387
Okay, everybody, line up.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.431
Get your kiss,
then get your cuddle.

07:11.722 --> 07:15.184
I say, I have been
trampled by a dinosaur

07:15.268 --> 07:17.103
and feel in dire need
of a cuddle.

Get in line, sugar.

[Lambie chuckles]

07:25.570 --> 07:27.363
Mwah.
[laughs]

07:27.447 --> 07:29.240
And one for you.
[chuckles]

07:29.323 --> 07:31.117
Mwah.
[giggles]

07:31.200 --> 07:32.326
Mwah.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.703
Ahh.
Mwah.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.413
There you go.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.165
Mwah.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.750
This was the best
part of my day.

07:39.834 --> 07:40.668
Me, too.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.212
But we can't keep kissing
and cuddling forever.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.964
Speak for yourself, Doc.

07:45.047 --> 07:48.217
This little lamb
could cuddle till
the cows come home.

07:48.676 --> 07:49.844
I know you could.

07:49.927 --> 07:54.390
But as a doctor,
I can't just let you toys
keep getting bronto boo-boos.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.727
Hey, what are you
all doing in here?

07:57.810 --> 08:01.314
Oh! I've been looking
all over for you. Ooh!
Let's play catch.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.107
Oh!
[squeak]

08:03.191 --> 08:04.025
Whoa!

08:04.400 --> 08:05.693
Oh, my!

08:06.360 --> 08:10.198
[laughs] You need to cool
your jets there, dino dearie.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.240
[chuckling]

08:11.324 --> 08:13.910
Bronty, I'd like
to have a talk with you.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.663
Can all you other toys
give us a minute alone?

08:18.164 --> 08:20.082
Sure thing, Doc.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.793
We'll be outside
if you need us.

08:23.836 --> 08:27.423
Bronty, I'm a doctor
for stuffed animals and toys.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.926
I love making toys
feel better,

08:30.009 --> 08:33.888
but today I had to kiss
more boo-boos than ever!

08:33.971 --> 08:35.765
Oh, no! What happened?

08:35.847 --> 08:37.892
I know you didn't mean to,

08:37.975 --> 08:40.269
but you hurt
some of the toys today.

08:40.727 --> 08:41.604
Me?

08:41.979 --> 08:43.022
That's right.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.316
I'm afraid you really
need to be careful

08:45.399 --> 08:47.985
playing with toys
so much smaller than you.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.904
You're hurting them.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.948
I... I'm sorry, Doc.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.284
I can't help being so big.
[sniffles]

08:55.368 --> 08:58.412
I'll never play
with the other toys
ever again!

08:58.496 --> 09:00.540
Bronty,
that's not what I meant!

09:02.250 --> 09:03.918
[Lambie] Doc,
is everything okay?

09:04.418 --> 09:07.213
Bronty came running out
looking really sad.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.840
He feels bad
that he hurt you all.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.635
Aw. Poor guy.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.470
We know he didn't mean it.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.180
Did you see where he went?

09:16.264 --> 09:20.268
I think he's
behind the birdbath
trying to hide.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.397
[sniffling]

09:24.897 --> 09:26.023
Bronty?

09:27.024 --> 09:28.484
How'd you find me?

09:28.568 --> 09:32.405
You're too big to hide
behind the birdbath.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.991
I hate being big.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.909
Bronty,
it's okay to be big.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.204
I know you didn't mean
to hurt the other toys.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.748
But you have to remember
you're bigger than them.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.667
You have to be
extra careful

09:44.750 --> 09:46.544
when you play
with smaller toys.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.921
Just like I have
to be careful

09:49.005 --> 09:50.881
when playing with
my little brother Donny.

09:51.215 --> 09:54.176
You have to be careful,
too? Really?

09:54.677 --> 09:58.347
Really. People and toys
come in all sizes.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.767
You're bigger.
That's who you are,
and that's great.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.478
You just can't play
so rough.

Okay, Doc, I'll be careful

And then everyone
will have more fun.

still wanna play.

for a check-up, Bronty.

And how! Stuffy's
looking a little rough.
He needs some help.

17:25.752 --> 17:30.215
The check-up's
not for Stuffy, Bronty.
It's for you.

17:44.021 --> 17:47.483
That's great, Bronty,
but you're here because...

you have bad breath.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.822
Honey, don't take this
the wrong way,

17:53.906 --> 17:57.117
but your breath
could strip the grease
off a griddle.

from my own breath.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.920
Oh, wait.

18:08.670 --> 18:11.673
Everyone was
running away from me.

18:11.757 --> 18:15.844
Not you, your breath.
We love you.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.222
Don't worry.
I can fix your breath.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.849
I'm going to give you
a dental check-up.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.185
Uh, how's that
gonna help me?

18:23.560 --> 18:26.855
I'm going to look
inside your mouth
and check your teeth

18:26.939 --> 18:29.858
to see if something in there
is causing the bad smell.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.653
Now, don't you worry
about a thing, pumpkin.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.404
This won't hurt a bit.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.531
[gasps] Oh...

18:35.614 --> 18:39.201
Uh, no need to thank me...
really.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.039
You're gonna
love this chair.

18:45.958 --> 18:50.295
Ooh, that was fun.
So far, this dental
check-up's not so bad.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.257
Now open wide.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.636
Aah...

18:57.970 --> 18:59.721
Here it is.

19:00.013 --> 19:04.893
Oh. It looks like
a piece of... salami.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.895
[Doc] That's exactly
what it is.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.273
I have a diagnosis.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.401
Bronty, you have
stinky salami breath.

19:12.776 --> 19:16.738
I just know
this one's going in
the <span style="style.default_1">Big Book of Boo-Boos.</span>

19:17.614 --> 19:20.325
[Bronty] Oh! Donny shared
some salami with me.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.577
It was yummy.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.329
But is that what made
my breath smell?

19:24.705 --> 19:25.956
That's right.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.750
Sometimes when food gets
stuck between your teeth,

19:28.834 --> 19:30.335
it starts to smell bad.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.921
Oh! Now that you took
the salami out,

19:33.005 --> 19:34.923
my breath
is fine again, right?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.508
Hooray! Whoo-hoo!

19:36.592 --> 19:38.260
Hoo-hoo! Oh.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.012
Ooh.

19:41.597 --> 19:45.475
Oh, no.
This is hopeless,
horrible...

19:46.727 --> 19:49.104
I mean, really, really bad.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.148
[Doc]
It's not hopeless, Bronty.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.609
There's a cure
for stinky salami breath.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.235
And it will just
take a minute.

19:55.736 --> 20:00.407
I could sure use a hug...
Ooh, I mean, cuddle right now.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.535
I'm going in. [inhales]

20:04.578 --> 20:05.871
You go, girl.

20:07.748 --> 20:08.999
Oh, thank you, Lambie.

20:09.082 --> 20:12.961
This makes me
feel much happier!
Oops. Sorry.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.880
[exhales]

20:14.963 --> 20:15.923
Bronty.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.507
What are those?

20:17.841 --> 20:20.552
This is a toothbrush,
and this is toothpaste.

20:20.886 --> 20:24.723
You squeeze a little bit
of toothpaste
onto the toothbrush.

20:24.806 --> 20:27.351
Then you stick
the brushy end in your mouth

20:27.434 --> 20:28.602
and you...
No way!

20:28.685 --> 20:32.189
I'm not sticking
that thing in my mouth.
Uh-uh. Mm-mmm.

20:32.272 --> 20:35.734
Bronty,
aren't you going to open up?

20:36.401 --> 20:38.820
Mm-mm! Mm-mm! Mm...

20:38.904 --> 20:44.701
That's too bad,
'cause brushing your teeth
feels so good.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.370
It sure does, Doc.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.873
Brushing is so nice,
