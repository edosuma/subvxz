<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:04.769 --> 00:07.972
I took "legal guardianship"
over Kalani.

00:07.972 --> 00:09.974
<i>With Kira being pregnant,</i>
<i>she's not here because</i>

00:09.974 --> 00:11.308
she has to take care
of her body.

00:11.308 --> 00:13.878
JILL:
<i>Abby's passion now isn't dance.</i>

00:13.878 --> 00:16.047
<i>It's the almighty dollar.</i>

00:16.047 --> 00:17.181

And in first place,

00:17.181 --> 00:18.215
"The Vultures!"

(crowd cheering)
JILL:
All right, girls!

00:19.450 --> 00:20.851

KIRA: <i>You can sit there</i>

00:20.851 --> 00:23.621
with your liposuction
and your plastic surgery

00:23.621 --> 00:25.823
and your tummy tuck.

00:25.823 --> 00:27.158
I don't care what you think.

00:27.158 --> 00:28.626
Woman with three baby daddies
and a criminal record.

00:28.626 --> 00:30.895
I'm not gonna sit here
and allow her

00:30.895 --> 00:33.097
to play her (bleep) games,
so go (bleep) yourself!

00:33.097 --> 00:35.433
Brynn is on probation.

00:35.433 --> 00:37.668
No, I'm not coming back
as long as she's there.

00:44.542 --> 00:45.643

00:45.643 --> 00:47.144
Todrick, come on!

00:47.144 --> 00:50.181
(cheering, whooping)

00:50.181 --> 00:52.383
Walk your (bleep) that way!

00:52.383 --> 00:53.517
I am so mad at her.

00:53.517 --> 00:54.351
ABBY LEE:
<i>Can you hit me?</i>

00:54.351 --> 00:56.387
Please hit me.

00:56.387 --> 00:57.588
I don't know
what Abby's thinking right now.

00:57.588 --> 01:00.591
Two trios will go up
against each other.

01:00.591 --> 01:01.926
Brynn, you're
going to be

01:01.926 --> 01:03.527
<i>a team captain.</i>

01:03.527 --> 01:06.363
<i>Maddie, you are going to be</i>
<i>a team captain.</i>

01:06.363 --> 01:09.133
If Brynn's team wins,
she'll be on the team.

"Unfortunately"?

For the last few weeks,

I have been home taking care
of my newborn, and Melissa

So the ultimatum is out?

02:10.561 --> 02:12.463
No, I'm not coming back
as long as she's there.

02:12.463 --> 02:14.532
So if she stays,
you're not coming back?

02:15.533 --> 02:17.501
You hate her
that much?
Yeah.

02:18.702 --> 02:21.005
Oh, I don't even care
who's here. I mean,

02:21.005 --> 02:23.307

Well, it's the

02:24.742 --> 02:27.411
Hello! Hello! Hello!
We have a long overdue visitor

02:27.411 --> 02:30.281

Oh, my God, that is so cute!

02:30.281 --> 02:31.782
(laughs)

02:31.782 --> 02:34.018
Thank you!
Yes!

02:34.018 --> 02:36.287
So is that Kira's reward
for finally showing up?

02:36.287 --> 02:38.923
Yeah. What happened
to my ultimatum?

02:38.923 --> 02:40.457
We made it work, we...

02:40.457 --> 02:41.659

JILL:
<i>To be honest with you,</i>

02:44.595 --> 02:47.765
I want Kira here
to put Ashlee in her place.

02:47.765 --> 02:51.569
<i>I don't think our team needs</i>
<i>a big fat mouth like Ashlee.</i>

02:51.569 --> 02:52.837
She's a big bully.

02:52.837 --> 02:55.472
She bullied me,
she bullied the kids.

02:55.472 --> 02:57.441
ASHLEE:
Kalani is not as good as

02:57.441 --> 02:59.243
she used to be.
What?!

02:59.243 --> 03:01.278
I do think Kendall could've
played it up a little bit more.

03:01.278 --> 03:02.279
I'm sure you do think that.

03:02.279 --> 03:04.014
ASHLEE:
Kendall is old news.

03:04.014 --> 03:05.349
Don't talk about other kids!

03:05.349 --> 03:07.718
She needs to stop, and Kira,

03:07.718 --> 03:10.554
<i>of all people,</i>
<i>knows that the most.</i>

03:10.554 --> 03:12.556
<i>They haven't liked each other</i>
<i>for years.</i>

03:12.556 --> 03:15.826

Okay, ladies,

03:15.826 --> 03:17.728
congratulations to the group!

03:17.728 --> 03:21.298
(whooping)

03:21.298 --> 03:25.169
<i>The Vultures‐‐</i>
<i>they grabbed the prey!</i>

03:25.169 --> 03:28.072
<i>They picked them up,</i>
<i>they dropped them,</i>

03:28.072 --> 03:29.673
like puppies in a field. Pssh!

03:29.673 --> 03:31.775
I'm going to do things
a little differently.

03:31.775 --> 03:32.643
Shall we?

03:32.643 --> 03:33.844
At the top

03:33.844 --> 03:34.778
of the pyramid:

03:34.778 --> 03:36.313
Maddie.

03:36.313 --> 03:37.548
(applause)

03:38.549 --> 03:39.984
Maddie, you had a solo.

03:39.984 --> 03:41.185
You won.

03:41.185 --> 03:43.153
<i>I thought it was</i>
<i>absolutely exquisite.</i>

03:43.153 --> 03:44.688
<i>It was perfect.</i>

03:45.756 --> 03:48.192
Sharing that top spot
with her...

03:50.895 --> 03:53.631
...is the child left behind...

03:53.631 --> 03:54.732
(cheering)

03:54.732 --> 03:57.501
...in Pittsburgh,
because Mackenzie

03:57.501 --> 04:00.905
was our overall
scholarship winner.

04:00.905 --> 04:02.239
Boom!

04:02.239 --> 04:03.474
MELISSA: <i>Kenzie wasn't</i>
<i>with us last week.</i>

04:03.474 --> 04:05.342
<i>She was back home in Pittsburgh</i>

04:05.342 --> 04:08.212
<i>competing with</i>
<i>the Pittsburgh studio.</i>

04:08.212 --> 04:10.848
And I'm so proud of her, because
she beat out almost 200 kids

04:10.848 --> 04:12.383
for that scholarship,

04:12.383 --> 04:15.352
and she's really growing
into an amazing dancer.

04:15.352 --> 04:20.124
Then, pretty much
straight across the board,

04:20.124 --> 04:21.792
we have...

04:21.792 --> 04:23.127
Nia.

04:24.295 --> 04:25.396
Kendall.

04:26.530 --> 04:29.033
We have Kalani,

04:29.033 --> 04:30.167
and...

04:31.936 --> 04:34.104
...Brynn.
JOJO:
Brynn.

04:35.139 --> 04:36.607
ABBY LEE:
<i>In the group dance,</i>

04:36.607 --> 04:41.879
<i>you all really focused</i>
<i>on not being the weak link.</i>

04:41.879 --> 04:43.113
It was right on the money.

04:44.782 --> 04:46.650
On the bottom of the pyramid,

04:46.650 --> 04:48.485
JoJo.

04:51.388 --> 04:52.656
I need to see

04:52.656 --> 04:55.392
you stretch those
legs straighter

04:55.392 --> 04:57.661
<i>and get that flexibility. Yes?</i>

04:57.661 --> 04:59.730
<i>You don't want to be</i>
<i>a one‐trick pony.</i>

05:00.965 --> 05:02.633
This week, we will be

05:02.633 --> 05:06.070
attending Xpressions
Dance Competition.

05:06.070 --> 05:10.040
Two trios will go
up against each other

05:10.040 --> 05:11.709
in the competition.

05:11.709 --> 05:14.611
As you can all clearly count,
there are seven girls.

05:14.611 --> 05:15.813
That means someone's left out.

05:18.115 --> 05:19.249
ABBY LEE:
Brynn, step forward.

05:22.052 --> 05:23.354
Brynn, you're going to be...

05:25.022 --> 05:26.657
... a team captain.

05:28.993 --> 05:30.461
That's strange.
All right.

05:30.461 --> 05:31.595
Maddie,

05:31.595 --> 05:33.597
step forward.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.469
You are going to be
a team captain.

05:38.469 --> 05:39.670
Oh.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.671
I have a question.

05:40.671 --> 05:42.172
How did you come up with

05:42.172 --> 05:43.340
the team captains?

05:43.340 --> 05:44.808
ASHLEE: Can you just
let her have something?

05:44.808 --> 05:45.809
I never said she
shouldn't have it.

05:45.809 --> 05:46.844
Just please,
let her have something.

05:46.844 --> 05:48.078
I wanted to know

05:48.078 --> 05:50.080
what Abby's reasoning was,
that's all.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.049
Winning solos this season.

05:52.049 --> 05:53.050
Okay. There you go.

05:53.050 --> 05:54.518
ABBY LEE:
<i>The moms are just</i>

05:54.518 --> 05:57.454
making such a big deal
out of Brynn.

05:57.454 --> 06:00.257
<i>Every chance they get,</i>
<i>they are ready to pounce.</i>

06:00.257 --> 06:03.761
<i>I feel bad for the kid</i>
<i>because I don't see the mother</i>

06:03.761 --> 06:06.063
<i>working to get along</i>
<i>with others.</i>

06:06.063 --> 06:07.364
Figure it out, ladies.

06:08.365 --> 06:09.533
All right, so,

06:09.533 --> 06:12.903
Brynn, I need your first choice.

06:12.903 --> 06:14.471
Um...

06:18.475 --> 06:20.144
Yes!

06:20.144 --> 06:21.445
ABBY LEE:
All right. Maddie?

06:23.313 --> 06:26.216
Yay!

06:26.216 --> 06:27.818
ABBY LEE:
Brynn?

06:33.690 --> 06:36.326
(cheering)

06:46.270 --> 06:48.372
Oh!
I'm sorry, Nia!

06:48.372 --> 06:50.774
HOLLY: <i>It's a shame that that</i>
<i>happened, but am I surprised?</i>

06:50.774 --> 06:52.643
Absolutely not, because

06:52.643 --> 06:55.546
<i>Nia's left out consistently.</i>
<i>It's a pattern.</i>

06:55.546 --> 06:57.514
<i>And as a mom, you want</i>
<i>to protect your child,</i>

06:57.514 --> 06:59.016
<i>but you can't</i>

06:59.016 --> 07:00.417
protect your child
from everything.

07:01.785 --> 07:03.153
ASHLEE:
Abby, if Brynn's trio

07:03.153 --> 07:04.421
does well, do you think

07:04.421 --> 07:06.056
that we could maybe
get an answer

07:06.056 --> 07:07.891
as to whether or not
she's on the team?

07:07.891 --> 07:10.094
Yes! In fact, if
Brynn's team wins,

07:10.094 --> 07:12.062
she'll be on the team.

07:12.062 --> 07:14.598
And if your trio
does not win,

07:14.598 --> 07:18.302
you might be right back where
you started‐‐ in Arizona.

07:18.302 --> 07:19.870
ASHLEE:
<i>I know without a doubt</i>

07:19.870 --> 07:22.606
that Brynn is more talented
than all the girls here.

07:22.606 --> 07:24.441
<i>These moms better</i>
<i>get off their high horse</i>

07:24.441 --> 07:26.076
<i>and make their kids</i>
<i>work harder,</i>

07:26.076 --> 07:27.611
<i>because Brynn is gonna win</i>
<i>with this number</i>

07:27.611 --> 07:29.613
<i>and be crowned a new member</i>
<i>of this team.</i>

07:29.613 --> 07:32.449
ABBY LEE: I want to talk
about this group routine.

07:32.449 --> 07:35.119
Now, we're trying to kill
two birds with one stone.

07:35.119 --> 07:39.923
When we do this group
routine, we are also

07:39.923 --> 07:45.429
going to shoot a commercial
here in the studio on Friday.

07:45.429 --> 07:47.764
It's a webmercial.

07:47.764 --> 07:52.703
This commercial is to promote
and advertise my dance studio.

07:52.703 --> 07:55.172
It's fun, it's sassy,
it's a 30‐second spot.

07:55.172 --> 07:58.075
So the group dance and the
commercial are one and the same?

07:58.075 --> 08:00.210
Yes. Everything that we're using
for the commercial

08:00.210 --> 08:03.480
are then transferred
right into the group routine.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.015
HOLLY:
<i>With Abby's</i>

08:05.015 --> 08:06.617
description of the group dance

08:06.617 --> 08:10.487
being based on the commercial‐‐
right there,

08:10.487 --> 08:13.157
<i>there's not as clear a plan</i>
<i>for the group dance</i>

08:13.157 --> 08:14.858
as there is for the commercial.

08:14.858 --> 08:16.860
<i>The commercial is only</i>
<i>30 seconds.</i>

08:16.860 --> 08:19.229
<i>The group dance needs to be</i>
<i>at least a minute and half.</i>

08:19.229 --> 08:22.366
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>
<i>It doesn't add up.</i>

08:22.366 --> 08:24.201
This is not a good sign
for the group dance.

08:24.201 --> 08:25.936
And we have a guest
that's coming in

08:25.936 --> 08:28.972
to direct the commercial
and work with me.

08:28.972 --> 08:31.008
So, uh, Todrick, come on!

08:31.008 --> 08:33.577
(cheering)

08:34.444 --> 08:36.480
(Abby Lee whooping)

08:38.515 --> 08:41.618
MELISSA: <i>Our girls are really</i>
<i>excited because they love him.</i>

08:41.618 --> 08:43.687
Todrick is a YouTuber,

08:43.687 --> 08:46.123
<i>and the girls did</i>
<i>"Freaks Like Me" with him.</i>

08:46.123 --> 08:47.724
<i>It was so much fun for them.</i>

08:47.724 --> 08:50.494
<i>Todrick's so creative</i>
<i>and talented,</i>

08:50.494 --> 08:51.762
so I'm sure
it's gonna be great.

08:51.762 --> 08:53.197
That‐that made an
entrance, got it?

08:53.197 --> 08:54.565
(laughs):
Yeah.

08:54.565 --> 08:55.866
ABBY LEE:
All right, uh...

08:55.866 --> 08:57.100
TODRICK: Wait, I have a
question before we start.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.502
Can I please be
on the pyramid?

08:58.502 --> 09:00.504
As long as you have
your mother call me.

09:00.504 --> 09:01.805
Okay.
(laughter)

09:03.540 --> 09:06.577
So, your routine
for this week's competition,

09:06.577 --> 09:09.713
as well as the theme
for the entire

09:09.713 --> 09:13.951
webmercial is inspired
by <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

09:13.951 --> 09:16.353
(cheering)

09:16.353 --> 09:20.090
So, we will be doing

09:20.090 --> 09:21.792
"Ease On Down Santa
Monica Boulevard."

09:21.792 --> 09:22.793
(cheering)

09:24.661 --> 09:28.131
And each of you will be singing
in the commercial, too.

09:28.131 --> 09:30.067
So we have to hurry,

09:30.067 --> 09:31.735
because we only have
so much time

09:31.735 --> 09:32.970
to get things done.

09:32.970 --> 09:34.304
Let's do this.

09:34.304 --> 09:37.107
JILL: <i>I think the commercial</i>
<i>is a great idea.</i>

09:37.107 --> 09:40.644
However, Abby is not known as
being the "collaborative" type.

09:43.647 --> 09:47.317
ABBY LEE: <i>Mackenzie has a lead</i>
<i>role singing in this video.</i>

09:47.317 --> 09:49.586
<i>She should be billed</i>
<i>as a featured artist.</i>

09:49.586 --> 09:50.787
The result of that,

09:50.787 --> 09:52.689
we're not gonna be able
to use Mackenzie

09:52.689 --> 09:55.492
in the vocal part,
which is fine.

09:55.492 --> 09:57.527
Um, and other than that,
that's it.

09:57.527 --> 10:00.297
No, no, no, no. They're...
She's not in it at all.

10:00.297 --> 10:01.298
This is gonna end badly.

10:01.298 --> 10:02.599
I'm pulling the plug on this.

10:02.599 --> 10:04.935
JILL:
<i>Abby is a one‐woman show.</i>

10:04.935 --> 10:07.938
<i>She wants everything</i>
<i>under her control.</i>

10:07.938 --> 10:10.340
<i>We definitely don't need Abby</i>

10:10.340 --> 10:11.675
burning another bridge,

10:11.675 --> 10:13.810
especially with someone
as big as Todrick.

10:15.112 --> 10:16.713
ABBY LEE: All right,
Kalani, Brynn,

10:16.713 --> 10:20.317
Mackenzie are doing
a contemporary routine

10:20.317 --> 10:24.121
<i>with several acrobatic</i>
<i>or gymnastic tricks in it.</i>

10:24.121 --> 10:25.922
And it is called

10:25.922 --> 10:27.658
<i>"The World Is Ours."</i>

10:27.658 --> 10:31.962
You three are doing a piece
called "The Golden Girls."

10:31.962 --> 10:34.031
It is contemporary jazz.

10:34.031 --> 10:36.366
It's jazzy, bluesy a bit,

10:36.366 --> 10:40.003
but it has a contemporary
style of dance.

10:40.003 --> 10:42.072
Okay. Are we
cool on that?

10:42.072 --> 10:43.473
<i>All right,</i>

you're up first.

10:46.443 --> 10:48.345

10:48.345 --> 10:51.815

10:51.815 --> 10:54.184
Yeah. That thing.

10:54.184 --> 10:56.186
MELISSA: <i>She's doing</i>

10:56.186 --> 10:57.587

to choreograph.

10:57.587 --> 10:59.356
HOLLY: <i>We have a commercial</i>
<i>she wants to shoot,</i>

10:59.356 --> 11:01.158

11:16.673 --> 11:18.175
I mean...

11:18.175 --> 11:20.777

make‐it‐or‐break‐it moment.

11:20.777 --> 11:22.479
<i>She's gonna be a member</i>
<i>of this team,</i>

11:22.479 --> 11:23.914
<i>and she's not going anywhere.</i>

11:23.914 --> 11:25.482
I just think it's funny

11:25.482 --> 11:28.685
that Brynn can put
your differences aside,

11:28.685 --> 11:30.454
<i>and she picked Kalani first.</i>

11:30.454 --> 11:31.722
So, ultimately, Kira,

11:31.722 --> 11:33.423
Kalani will help Brynn

11:33.423 --> 11:35.559
<i>to stay on the team</i>
<i>if they win.</i>

11:35.559 --> 11:38.628
So Brynn's fate lies
with Kalani. (laughs)

11:38.628 --> 11:39.896
That's ironic.
JILL: That is ironic.

11:39.896 --> 11:41.131
Given that you gave
that ultimatum.

11:41.131 --> 11:43.633
So, Kira, if you really
want them gone,

11:43.633 --> 11:44.868
there's one way to do it.

HOLLY: <i>I think it's gonna be</i>
<i>really hard for the girls</i>

36:09.298 --> 36:12.401
<i>to win with this dance number,</i>
<i>because</i>

36:12.401 --> 36:13.735
it's a commercial.

36:13.735 --> 36:15.904
It wasn't a competition dance.

37:46.028 --> 37:48.730
<i>Like, I was not sure</i>
<i>if that was gonna happen.</i>

37:48.730 --> 37:51.500
I watched the trios, and I
thought it could go either way.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.770
And the fact that they won,
I couldn't be happier.

37:54.770 --> 37:55.971
<i>Because now</i>
<i>she's gonna be on the team,</i>

37:55.971 --> 37:57.839

<i>that these moms</i>

37:57.839 --> 37:59.474

38:00.742 --> 38:02.444

Take a bow on three.

38:02.444 --> 38:04.313
One, two, three. Take a bow.
Congratulations.
Just so you all know.

38:04.313 --> 38:05.814
They're backwards?
The numbers
are backwards.

38:05.814 --> 38:07.916
Yeah.
Ladies and gentlemen, that does

38:07.916 --> 38:11.520
conclude our award ceremony here
at Xpression Dance Competition.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.022
I want to thank Anaheim
for bringing us here.

38:14.022 --> 38:15.958
JILL: <i>I've been</i>
<i>to a lot of competitions</i>

38:15.958 --> 38:18.760
in my time, and I am shocked

38:18.760 --> 38:20.729
<i>that our girls</i>
<i>didn't come out on top.</i>

38:20.729 --> 38:24.099
Plus, the announcer
flip‐flopped the numbers.

38:24.099 --> 38:26.902
I think something
is definitely up.

38:28.403 --> 38:30.072
ABBY LEE:
<i>The mothers are</i>

38:30.072 --> 38:32.441
freaking me out because
when you're announcing,

38:32.441 --> 38:35.210
you're announcing the wrong
number with the wrong dance.

38:35.210 --> 38:36.912
ANNOUNCER: <i>"The World is Ours"</i>
<i>did score highest.</i>

38:36.912 --> 38:38.714
The blue acro.
Regardless of their number.
Mm‐hmm.

38:38.714 --> 38:40.682
Yeah, yeah.
You know that?

38:40.682 --> 38:41.883
Yep, I know that
for a fact.

38:41.883 --> 38:43.518
It was, like,
two‐point‐something
points higher.

38:43.518 --> 38:45.320
ABBY LEE: <i>The mothers,</i>
<i>they shouldn't have any say</i>

38:45.320 --> 38:47.556
<i>whatsoever about scoring</i>

38:47.556 --> 38:49.524
or score sheets or
anything else for that matter.

38:49.524 --> 38:51.460
<i>It's not their problem.</i>

38:51.460 --> 38:52.494
It's not their business.

(whoops)

38:54.629 --> 38:56.264
JESSALYNN:
Come here.
Beautiful.

38:56.264 --> 38:57.632
It was beautiful,
sweetheart.
Can I get a hug?

38:57.632 --> 38:58.834
You were really pretty.

38:58.834 --> 39:00.002
It was beautiful.
BRYNN: Thank you.

39:00.002 --> 39:01.069
Here's your jacket.

39:01.069 --> 39:02.771
Why don't you
put it on.

39:02.771 --> 39:04.106
MACKENZIE:
<i>I think Brynn is</i>

39:04.106 --> 39:05.307
a good addition to the team.

39:05.307 --> 39:07.109
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>she's a really good dancer.</i>

39:07.109 --> 39:10.012
But her mom is a little crazy.
(chuckles)

39:10.012 --> 39:10.946
So does that make it

39:10.946 --> 39:12.347
official, Abby?

39:12.347 --> 39:13.782
I think it makes it official.
Yes.

39:13.782 --> 39:15.684
Congratulations.
Yay!

39:15.684 --> 39:17.986
ABBY LEE:
All right?

39:17.986 --> 39:19.921
JILL: <i>Ashlee has been</i>
<i>nothing but rude.</i>

39:19.921 --> 39:23.492
<i>Picking on my child,</i>
<i>other children.</i>

39:23.492 --> 39:26.161
She thinks her kid's
better than everybody else.

39:26.161 --> 39:28.463
<i>I cannot rejoice</i>

39:28.463 --> 39:30.265
in Brynn getting her jacket.

39:30.265 --> 39:31.466
I'm sorry.

39:31.466 --> 39:33.001
Jill, Melissa,

39:33.001 --> 39:34.803
you were saying something
about...

39:34.803 --> 39:37.406
the scores.

39:37.406 --> 39:38.640
She said the numbers
were wrong.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.841
They flip‐flopped the
numbers when they...

39:39.841 --> 39:41.176
ABBY LEE:
Yes. So he was telling me

39:41.176 --> 39:44.046
that number, in the blue,

39:44.046 --> 39:45.614
were the ones that won.

39:45.614 --> 39:47.749
They were two points
above the other trio.

39:47.749 --> 39:50.318
He knew that, right off
the top of his head.

39:50.318 --> 39:52.387
Abby, that sounds so ridiculous.

39:52.387 --> 39:54.589
Well, here it is. Here it is.

39:54.589 --> 39:55.757
That means nothing to me.

39:55.757 --> 39:58.060
We asked you
for the score sheet.

39:59.061 --> 40:00.195
I'm not gonna stand here

40:00.195 --> 40:01.863
and listen to you try to
discredit what happened.

40:01.863 --> 40:02.864
Let her have something!

40:02.864 --> 40:04.933
MELISSA:
She has everything.

40:04.933 --> 40:06.168
Whatever.
JILL: Let her go.

40:06.168 --> 40:08.003
Go cry somewhere!

40:08.003 --> 40:09.237
Your mom needs
something.

40:09.237 --> 40:10.705
I don't know
what, but...

40:12.040 --> 40:13.241
Screw you, Jill.

40:13.241 --> 40:14.810
I am sick and tired
of your mouth,

40:14.810 --> 40:17.312
and Brynn and I are not gonna
stand here and listen to this.

40:17.312 --> 40:21.083
ASHLEE: I'm just amazed at how
mean they can be to my daughter,

40:21.083 --> 40:22.884
and it's like nothing happened.

40:22.884 --> 40:24.219
JILL:
What are you up to?

40:25.320 --> 40:28.190
JILL:
Ooh, it smells funny in here.

40:29.758 --> 40:31.760
What?

40:32.861 --> 40:34.629
Well, she's wrong.

40:34.629 --> 40:36.031
Wait, wait, Jill,
what are you saying?

40:36.031 --> 40:37.999
Ashlee said all of the moms
are mean to her daughter,

40:37.999 --> 40:40.135
and I said you don't have
to listen to her,

40:40.135 --> 40:41.703
because she's wrong.

40:41.703 --> 40:42.971
Wait, you don't think
that hurt her feelings

40:42.971 --> 40:44.940
when you just said the whole
competition was rigged?

40:44.940 --> 40:46.942
JILL:
You stupid you‐know‐what.

40:46.942 --> 40:48.343
No one said...
Really?

40:48.343 --> 40:49.544
Yes, really.

40:49.544 --> 40:51.079
Really?

40:51.079 --> 40:53.815
She's the only one
who said it was rigged.

40:53.815 --> 40:55.317
That's (bleep) and you know it!

40:55.317 --> 40:57.185
I never said
it was rigged.

40:57.185 --> 40:59.287
I never...
You were the only one
who said it was rigged.

40:59.287 --> 41:00.755
I didn't say anything. I'm the
one who said that's ridiculous

41:00.755 --> 41:01.957
that you're saying it's rigged.

41:01.957 --> 41:03.792
I'm not gonna listen
to her lies!

41:03.792 --> 41:05.460
I'm always gonna look like
the bad guy

41:05.460 --> 41:08.130
because everybody turns
against me and I'm stupid!

41:08.130 --> 41:09.498
I don't want to do it.

41:09.498 --> 41:12.767
You want some stupid (bleep)
on your team!

41:12.767 --> 41:14.102
ASHLEE: They don't want
us here, that's fine!

41:14.102 --> 41:15.904
I'm done.

41:15.904 --> 41:17.239
They're all (bleep).

41:17.239 --> 41:19.007
But you just
got the jacket.

41:19.007 --> 41:21.476
(sighs)

41:21.476 --> 41:22.911
Brynn, let's go.

41:22.911 --> 41:23.912
This is ridiculous. Let's go.

41:23.912 --> 41:25.614
Come on.
(sobbing)

41:25.614 --> 41:28.316
ASHLEE: <i>It's really sad</i>
<i>that Brynn is finally getting</i>

41:28.316 --> 41:31.419
<i>the recognition she deserves,</i>
<i>she gets her jacket,</i>

41:31.419 --> 41:33.989
and they're all gonna crap
all over this for her.

41:37.325 --> 41:39.694
Okay, all right.

41:39.694 --> 41:42.097
(sobbing)
Good. I'm glad.

41:44.699 --> 41:47.002
Nope, she doesn't.
Let's go.

41:48.436 --> 41:50.539
This is what
I'm walking back into?

41:50.539 --> 41:52.574
<i>I was fine staying home.</i>

41:52.574 --> 41:54.176
Second thoughts, please?

41:54.176 --> 41:56.244
Can I take that back?
Takebacks.

41:58.980 --> 42:01.383
I am not allowing this woman

42:01.383 --> 42:04.553
to talk to my child like that!
KENDALL: You're so mean!

42:04.553 --> 42:05.720
Grow the (bleep) up!

42:05.720 --> 42:07.355
Jill! Jill!

42:07.355 --> 42:08.957
You can have her!

42:08.957 --> 42:11.459
MELISSA: <i>I'm not gonna miss out</i>
<i>on my kid's stuff anymore.</i>

42:12.527 --> 42:13.929
ABBY LEE:
<i>You have to go out there</i>

42:13.929 --> 42:16.932
<i>and portray what David Bowie</i>
<i>stood for.</i>

42:16.932 --> 42:19.134
Third place...

42:19.134 --> 42:21.603
A bitch talking about kids
the way she does, Abby!

42:21.603 --> 42:24.306
No, I said she does...
Shut up, Ashlee!

42:24.306 --> 42:26.208
(Brynn sobbing)
MELISSA: You look like a pig!
