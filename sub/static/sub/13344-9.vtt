WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.509
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.609 --> 00:10.578
SHE WENT TO FINALIZE
THE ABORTION.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.080
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT
ANOTHER BABY, OKAY?

00:12.180 --> 00:14.148
I DON'T THINK THE ISSUE

00:14.248 --> 00:16.284
IS AS CLEAR-CUT
AS BOTH OF YOU--

00:16.384 --> 00:18.119
YOU'RE TALKING
TO TWO PEOPLE

00:18.219 --> 00:20.921
WHO SPENT FIVE YEARS
IN FERTILITY TREATMENTS.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.390
IT SEEMS TO ME

00:22.490 --> 00:24.858
THAT YOU'RE NOT REALLY
TALKING ABOUT A CHILD.

00:24.958 --> 00:28.229
YOU'RE REALLY TALKING
ABOUT YOUR INABILITY TO
ACCEPT EACH OTHER.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.830
YOU HAVEN'T
HELPED US TO DECIDE

00:29.930 --> 00:31.699
WHETHER TO HAVE
THE BABY OR NOT,
BUT YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB

00:31.799 --> 00:34.235
OF GETTING US TO FIGHT.
YES TO THE PREGNANCY OR NO;

00:34.335 --> 00:35.969
TO HAVE AN ABORTION
OR NOT HAVE IT--

00:36.070 --> 00:37.371
JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.006
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW?

00:39.107 --> 00:40.508
YES.
I WANT A YES OR A NO.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.277
I THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE AN ABORTION.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.514
REALLY?

00:48.116 --> 00:50.584
( birds chirping )

01:07.201 --> 01:09.303
( footsteps approaching )

01:12.373 --> 01:14.442
HEY.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.177
HI.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.248
- SMOKING, HUH?
- NO.

01:20.348 --> 01:23.684
- NOT EVEN A DRAG?
- MAYBE JUST A PUFF.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.223
WHAT ABOUT OUR BABY?

01:29.323 --> 01:31.359
I DIDN'T INHALE.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.565
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:37.665 --> 01:40.268
I'VE GOT TO ADMIT,
I LOVE YOUR SMOKY SMELL.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.737
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

01:45.673 --> 01:46.907
( gasps )

01:47.007 --> 01:48.876
I HAVE A PAIN.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.012
JUST HERE.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.515
- SHE'LL GET OVER IT.
- SHE?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.250
YEAH. LILLIE.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.818
- THOMAS.
- KATHERINE.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.221
- ANDREW.
- ALICIA.

02:00.321 --> 02:03.224
SLOAN,
FOR MY GRANDFATHER.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.459
DON'T START
WITH FAMILY NAMES.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.828
REMEMBER MY
GRANDFATHER'S NAME, HUH?

02:07.928 --> 02:09.697
OTIS... OTIS...

02:09.797 --> 02:11.131
BEHAVE.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.966
YOU'RE ON PROBATION.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.536
IT'S GONE.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.104
IT IS?

02:17.205 --> 02:19.340
ONLY PROBLEM IS,
NOW I'VE GOT IT.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.610
- WHAT?
- PAIN.

02:24.178 --> 02:27.147
- YOUR STOMACH HURTS?
- I DON'T KNOW.
FEEL FOR YOURSELF.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.383
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
MY STOMACH, BUT IT'S...

02:29.483 --> 02:31.552
- WHAT THEN?
- WELL, SOMEWHERE LIKE--

02:31.652 --> 02:33.921
MAYBE IT'S IN MY PANCREAS
OR SOMETHING, MAYBE.

02:34.021 --> 02:37.525
- NEAR YOUR SPLEEN?
- YEAH, IT'S IN THAT
GENERAL VICINITY.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.295
( theme music playing )

02:59.913 --> 03:02.250
I DIDN'T KEEP
THE APPOINTMENT
WITH DR. KORNREICH.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.218
I DECIDED TO WAIT.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.753
I MEAN, YOU SAID LAST TIME

03:05.853 --> 03:08.222
THAT I DECIDED
WITHOUT THINKING IT OVER.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.691
SO NOW I'M
THINKING IT OVER.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.961
AND WHEN WE
LEFT HERE LAST TIME,

03:14.061 --> 03:15.496
JAKE DIDN'T
SAY A WORD ABOUT IT.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.531
EVEN LATER,
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.567
AND THAT NIGHT
WE WENT TO BED

03:19.667 --> 03:21.502
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG WITHOUT FIGHTING.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.838
Jake:
WE WERE WATCHING TV
AND I SAID,

03:24.938 --> 03:28.576
"I DON'T THINK
THIS PREGNANCY'S
WORTH FIGHTING OVER."

03:28.676 --> 03:31.445
AND I SAID, "I THINK
I MIGHT WANT THIS BABY."

03:31.545 --> 03:33.381
THEN I SAID,
"THINK ABOUT IT SOME MORE

03:33.481 --> 03:36.517
BECAUSE I PITY A CHILD
BORN TO A MOTHER WHO
DOESN'T WANT HIM."

03:36.617 --> 03:39.487
AND I SAID,
"I JUST SAID I THINK
I MIGHT WANT THIS BABY."

03:39.587 --> 03:42.690
- AND THAT WAS IT.
- ( laughs )

03:43.991 --> 03:45.626
Amy:
AND WE LAUGHED.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.596
AND I WOKE UP
THE NEXT MORNING--

03:48.696 --> 03:51.231
IT WAS LATE, ACTUALLY.
HE'D LEFT FOR WORK ALREADY

03:51.332 --> 03:52.666
AND TAKEN LENNY TO SCHOOL.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.303
AND I JUST DECIDED
TO TAKE THE DAY OFF.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.938
I WAS JUST LYING IN BED
THINKING AND I WAS ACTUALLY
ENJOYING MYSELF,

03:58.038 --> 04:00.240
YOU KNOW,
ENJOYING MY THOUGHTS.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.643
I THOUGHT
ABOUT GIVING BIRTH.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.813
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
I WONDERED WHETHER IT WAS
A BOY OR A GIRL.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.949
AND I JUST SOMEHOW KNEW
THAT IT'S A GIRL.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.819
AND I COULD IMAGINE LENNY
PUSHING SOME KID

04:11.919 --> 04:14.422
WHO TRIED TO
TAKE HER BIKE.
IT WAS SWEET.

04:14.522 --> 04:17.124
- VIOLENCE TURNS HER ON.
- ( chuckles )

04:17.224 --> 04:20.093
AND THEN I GOT DRESSED
AND THE WAISTBAND IN MY PANTS
WAS A LITTLE TIGHT,

04:20.193 --> 04:23.331
WHICH I DIDN'T LOVE,
BUT I DIDN'T GET
UPSET ABOUT IT.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.799
SO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
DR. KORNREICH SINCE?

04:25.899 --> 04:28.436
HUH-UH.

04:28.536 --> 04:33.006
AND I ASSUME
YOU'VE DISCUSSED THIS?

04:33.106 --> 04:35.743
WELL, NOT REALLY.
JAKE ASKED WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE DOCTOR'S

04:35.843 --> 04:37.277
AND I SAID I DIDN'T GO.
AND THAT WAS IT.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.780
WE DIDN'T TALK
ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.248
I MEAN, WE HAVE TIME,

04:41.349 --> 04:43.784
YOU KNOW?

04:43.884 --> 04:45.353
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:45.453 --> 04:48.956
WELL, FIRST OF ALL
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT
YOU CAME BACK.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.860
YOU BOTH SEEM

04:52.960 --> 04:54.662
MUCH MORE RELAXED THAN--

04:54.762 --> 04:56.864
THAN LAST WEEK.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.768
AND SINCE
A WEEK HAS GONE BY,

05:00.868 --> 05:03.404
YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE LESS TIME TO DECIDE.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.272
BUT THAT DOESN'T--
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

05:05.373 --> 05:06.674
BOTHERING EITHER OF YOU.

05:06.774 --> 05:10.678
LESS TIME? WHAT--
ARE YOU PRESSURING ME NOW?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.614
I MEAN, WE HAVE
AT LEAST TWO WEEKS.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.751
I DON'T KNOW, I-- I--

05:19.052 --> 05:21.655
I THINK WE'VE
SAID EVERYTHING
THAT WE NEED TO SAY.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.825
I THINK WHAT AMY'S
TRYING TO SAY, PAUL,

05:24.925 --> 05:27.294
IS THAT THIS IS
GONNA BE OUR LAST SESSION.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.663
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.
I-- I JUST THINK

05:29.763 --> 05:31.365
WE SHOULDN'T TALK
ABOUT IT SO MUCH.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.266
HE'LL GET OVER IT,
BELIEVE ME.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.068
NO, BUT LET'S
HEAR PAUL OUT.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.838
- BUT WE TALKED ABOUT IT.
- YEAH, BUT WE-- LET'S
JUST HEAR WHAT HE SAYS.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.007
YES, BUT WE DECIDED.

05:45.112 --> 05:45.879
I THINK IT'S TOO SOON.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.915
TOLD YOU.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.083
BOTH OF YOU NOW HAVE
MORE THAN ONE OPINION

05:50.183 --> 05:51.685
ABOUT THE PREGNANCY.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.722
IT'S NOT SO BLACK AND WHITE
AS IT-- AS IT WAS LAST WEEK.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.559
AND...

05:58.659 --> 06:01.061
I THINK THAT'S GOT
A LITTLE TO DO WITH

06:01.161 --> 06:02.696
YOU BOTH COMING HERE.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.302
WHAT DO YOU THINK, AMY?

06:09.403 --> 06:11.672
Amy:
MMM.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.013
MAYBE.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.183
I MEAN...

06:23.283 --> 06:24.652
I STILL WANT MY CAREER.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.387
I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IT UP.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.190
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I MIGHT BE ABLE

06:30.290 --> 06:32.926
TO MANAGE EVERYTHING.
I DON'T KNOW.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.729
I'M YOUNG ENOUGH
AND THE WORLD'S FULL
OF WORKING MOTHERS.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.131
AND MAYBE I'LL JUST
TAKE ON LESS CLIENTS.
I JUST--

06:38.231 --> 06:41.401
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D EVER BE ABLE
TO GET PREGNANT AGAIN.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.605
AND I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO DO SOMETHING
THAT I'D REGRET LATER.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.274
I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT,
ESPECIALLY WHEN I THINK

06:47.374 --> 06:49.477
OF WHAT A YOUNGER BROTHER
OR SISTER WOULD DO FOR LENNY.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.411
I JUST-- I--

06:51.512 --> 06:52.846
I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S FINAL,

06:52.946 --> 06:54.548
I JUST WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT

06:54.648 --> 06:56.349
AND I WILL MAKE
A DECISION SOON.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.986
I JUST-- I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT--

07:05.425 --> 07:07.561
SORRY.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.433
Jake:
AME?

07:20.841 --> 07:22.710
BABY?

07:23.744 --> 07:25.613
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
LET ME IN.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.781
- ( rattles doorknob )
- AME, LET ME IN.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.091
( car door slams )

07:43.997 --> 07:45.666
( car starts )

07:55.375 --> 07:57.545
KATE!

07:59.279 --> 08:01.448
KATE!

08:01.549 --> 08:03.751
KATE, CAN YOU
COME HERE A MINUTE?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.522
WHAT IS IT?

08:08.622 --> 08:11.859
HOW DO I GET
THIS BLOODSTAIN
OUT OF THE SOFA?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.530
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BLOOD?
- BLOOD.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.165
HOW DO I--
HOW DO I GET IT OUT?

08:18.265 --> 08:20.300
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:20.400 --> 08:21.769
OH, THE COUPLE
WHO WERE HERE--

08:21.869 --> 08:24.738
SHE'S--
SHE'S PREGNANT.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.607
W-- WHAT,
SHE HAD A MISCARRIAGE?

08:26.707 --> 08:28.642
NO, SHE WAS--
SHE WAS SITTING HERE,

08:28.742 --> 08:31.845
SHE-- SHE GOT THIS PAIN.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.547
SHE WENT TO THE BATHROOM,
SHE CAME BACK.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.449
- AND THERE WAS THIS BLOOD--
- ARE YOU OKAY?

08:36.550 --> 08:38.619
- YOU LOOK A LITTLE PALE.
- NO, I'M-- I'M-- I'M--

08:38.719 --> 08:40.688
I'M FINE, I'M JUST--

08:42.355 --> 08:44.057
IT'S BLOOD, IT'S--

08:46.026 --> 08:47.928
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES,
PAUL, DON'T.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.563
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
JUST DON'T TOUCH IT.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.599
BUT I-- I DON'T
WANT IT TO DRY, OKAY?

08:51.699 --> 08:54.668
I KNOW. JUST DON'T
TOUCH IT, ALL RIGHT?

08:59.306 --> 09:01.408
( sighs )
FUCK.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.410
THIS SHAMPOO
GETS OUT BLOODSTAINS,

09:03.510 --> 09:04.745
BUT, UM--

09:04.845 --> 09:07.314
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THESE THINGS?

09:07.414 --> 09:09.817
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
HOW MUCH I KNOW.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.987
I'M GOING TO TRY
HYDROGEN PEROXIDE FIRST.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.591
( chuckles )
OH. HYDROGEN PEROXIDE.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.893
THAT POOR WOMAN.
WHAT WEEK WAS SHE IN?

09:19.993 --> 09:21.895
I DON'T KNOW--
SEVENTH, EIGHTH.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.664
( groans )

09:25.265 --> 09:26.767
DID ANYTHING HAPPEN?

09:26.867 --> 09:30.203
- DID ANYTHING HAPPEN
DURING THE SESSION?
- NO.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.974
A FAIRLY NORMAL SESSION.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.178
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET PREGNANT FOREVER.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.248
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S
NOT GONNA LEAVE A STAIN?

09:41.348 --> 09:43.116
( laughs )
WELL...

09:43.216 --> 09:45.786
WHEN'S YOUR NEXT SESSION?
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO DRY.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.355
EVERYONE WHO COMES IN
IS GONNA SAY

09:48.455 --> 09:50.023
"WHAT-- WHAT IS IT?"

09:50.123 --> 09:53.026
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW SENSITIVE
SOME OF MY PATIENTS CAN BE.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.528
( laughs )
OH, RIGHT, YOUR PATIENTS
ARE SENSITIVE.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.798
NOT YOU.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.036
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.439
OKAY, WELL...

10:06.539 --> 10:08.909
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE
AFTER IT DRIES.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.445
I'LL CLEAN UP IN HERE
FOR YOU, MEANWHILE.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.915
NO NO NO, IT'S OKAY.
LEAVE IT.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.650
IT'S FINE.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.385
THANKS FOR DOING
THAT ANYWAY.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.520
YEP.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.357
WELL, MAYBE NOW YOU'LL
AGREE TO REPLACE THIS
FILTHY OLD COUCH.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.396
AND YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
MAKE THIS ROOM A BIT MORE
PLEASANT IN GENERAL.

10:29.496 --> 10:32.299
WHY ARE YOU SO
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS
ROOM ALL OF A SUDDEN?

10:32.399 --> 10:35.202
I THOUGHT YOU--
I THOUGHT YOU HATED IT.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.070
I DON'T HATE THIS ROOM.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.641
I'M JUST STILL
JEALOUS OF IT.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.177
( sighs )

10:47.547 --> 10:51.118
COME ON. I'LL MAKE YOU SOME
TEA BEFORE THE NEXT SESSION.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.288
I SUPPOSE NOT EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS IN HERE

10:55.388 --> 10:56.623
IS AS DRAMATIC
AS THIS, RIGHT?

10:56.724 --> 10:59.392
NO, IT ISN'T, KATE.
IT'S JUST AN OFFICE.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.294
REALLY.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.831
YOU KNOW, PAUL...
( groans )

11:03.931 --> 11:05.565
YOU CALL ME DOWN HERE
FOR ALL YOUR LITTLE
EMERGENCIES--

11:05.665 --> 11:07.735
FOR YOUR TOILET
AND YOUR SOFA.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.903
YOU JUST CAN'T WAIT TO GET ME
OUT OF HERE, CAN YOU?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.072
KATE, DO ME A FAVOR.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.608
NOTHING.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.444
I'M TIRED.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.312
I'M TIRED.
THAT'S ALL.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.681
IT'S NOT BIG DEAL.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.458
I, UH--

11:38.665 --> 11:40.868
I WENT BACK TO SEE GINA.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.072
GINA? WHEN?

11:47.140 --> 11:49.810
LAST WEEK.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.946
I JUST FELT I NEEDED
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO, YOU KNOW?

11:55.749 --> 11:58.385
- WHAT, TO GINA?
- YES, GINA.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.191
I-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I THOUGHT YOU DESPISED
THAT WOMAN.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.794
AREN'T YOU EXAGGERATING
JUST A LITTLE BIT?

12:06.894 --> 12:08.395
"THAT WOMAN"?

12:08.495 --> 12:10.964
ME? IT WAS ALL THAT CRAP SHE
WROTE ABOUT YOU. I THOUGHT--

12:11.064 --> 12:14.201
WELL, I HAD TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT--

12:14.301 --> 12:16.770
OH NO, OF COURSE
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.238
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN, KATE.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.473
IT'S EASIER FOR ME
TO TALK TO GINA

12:20.573 --> 12:23.777
THAN TO SOMEBODY
WHO-- WHO-- WHO
DOESN'T KNOW ME.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.514
GINA. JESUS.

12:27.614 --> 12:31.084
WHY IS GINA SUCH
A THREAT TO YOU, KATE?

12:31.184 --> 12:33.921
- TELL ME.
- DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE
ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.722
YOU WANT ME
OUT OF HERE? FINE.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.724
BUT NOT TALK TO ME
IN THAT CONDESCENDING

12:37.825 --> 12:39.626
PSYCHOLOGICAL TONE
BECAUSE I CAN'T BEAR IT.

12:39.726 --> 12:42.429
OH, JESUS CHRIST.
CAN I DO ANYTHING RIGHT?

12:42.529 --> 12:45.098
OH, WHAT? I'M SORRY,
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE ME?

12:45.198 --> 12:46.733
BECAUSE LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING:

12:46.834 --> 12:48.468
YOU'RE THE ONE WALKING
AROUND THIS HOUSE

12:48.568 --> 12:51.104
LIKE I AM FUCKING INVISIBLE,
NOT TO MENTION THE CHILDREN.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.973
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T WANT MAX
TO GO TO A SCHOOL FOR

12:53.073 --> 12:55.042
"GIFTED" CHILDREN
MEANS I DON'T SEE HIM?

12:55.142 --> 12:58.511
NO, PAUL, YOU'RE NOT SEEING
WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.381
AND WHAT IS HE
GOING THROUGH, KATE?

13:01.481 --> 13:03.716
DON'T YOU--
DON'T YOU HEAR

13:03.817 --> 13:05.485
THE WAY HE TALKS
ABOUT SCHOOL?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.487
DON'T YOU SEE THAT
HE HAS NO FRIENDS?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.756
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE OFF
IN YOUR OWN LITTLE WORLD.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.524
BUT I'M THE ONE LEFT
DEALING WITH THIS HOUSE.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.726
AND IF I'VE RAISED YOUR
CHILDREN TILL NOW, PAUL--

13:13.827 --> 13:17.230
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
SORRY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"RAISED MY CHILDREN"?

13:17.330 --> 13:21.401
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN,
"YOU RAISED MY CHILDREN"?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.571
( sighs )

13:24.671 --> 13:26.940
DON'T YOU SEE THAT
HE'S HOME ALL DAY?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.641
THAT HE NEVER
GOES TO FRIENDS',

13:28.741 --> 13:31.411
THAT NO ONE EVER
COMES TO SEE HIM?
DOESN'T THAT WORRY YOU?

13:31.511 --> 13:34.147
SO HOW DID YOU
DECIDE HE'S NOT HAVING
A GOOD TIME AT SCHOOL?

13:34.247 --> 13:38.251
I DIDN'T DECIDE.
HE TOLD ME.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.787
AND YOU, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT--

13:40.888 --> 13:42.722
YOU'RE SO DEFINITE
TELLING ME, YOU KNOW,

13:42.822 --> 13:45.725
THAT HE'S-- HE'S
NOT GOING TO A CLASS
FOR GIFTED CHILDREN.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.829
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT WHAT HE NEEDS
OR DOESN'T NEED?

13:50.597 --> 13:53.066
PAUL, HE HAS NO FRIENDS!

13:53.166 --> 13:54.601
NONE!

13:54.701 --> 13:57.770
HE SAYS HE'S ONLY WILLING
TO HANG OUT WITH MALCOLM.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.540
MALCOLM.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.676
I ASKED HIM--
I ASKED HIM

14:03.776 --> 14:05.245
IF HE GOES OUTSIDE
DURING RECESS

14:05.345 --> 14:07.214
AND HE SAID THAT
HE HARDLY DOES

14:07.314 --> 14:10.951
EXCEPT MAYBE WITH MALCOLM,
HIS ONE BARELY FRIEND.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.286
AND I ASKED HIM,
"ALL RIGHT, SO, SWEETHEART,

14:13.386 --> 14:15.422
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT SCHOOL IN GENERAL?"

14:16.789 --> 14:20.027
- AND HE SAYS
HE HATES SCHOOL.
- EVERY KID HATES SCHOOL.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.162
HE'S BORED
WITH SCHOOL, PAUL.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.998
HE'S BORED.
HE HATES HIS TEACHERS.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.200
ALL HIS TEACHERS HE'S HATES?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.970
YES, PAUL,
ALL OF HIS TEACHERS.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.205
THEY'RE ALL STUPID TO HIM

14:32.305 --> 14:35.642
AND HE'S BORED
WITH ALL OF THEM
AND HE HATES ALL OF THEM.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.748
AND THEN AFTER
HE TELLS ME THIS,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:41.848 --> 14:43.951
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
HE HAD TO TELL ME WAS?

14:44.051 --> 14:47.254
- WHAT?
- THAT I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.458
YOUR SON HAS NO FRIENDS,
HE HATES HIS SCHOOL,

14:51.558 --> 14:54.361
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT I NOT TELL YOU.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.197
BECAUSE IN YOUR OWN
WARPED WAY, PAUL,

14:57.297 --> 14:59.732
YOU'VE MADE HIM UNDERSTAND
THAT IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT

14:59.832 --> 15:03.470
AS WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS ROOM.
JUST LIKE YOU'VE DONE TO ME.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.015
YOU KNOW...

15:17.150 --> 15:18.986
FOR A LONG TIME,
YOU'VE NOT MADE ME FEEL

15:19.086 --> 15:21.188
LIKE I WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING TO YOU.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.759
NOT ME,
NOT THE KIDS,

15:26.859 --> 15:29.662
NOT COMPARED
TO WHAT HAPPENS IN HERE.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.005
IS THAT IT?

15:43.343 --> 15:46.513
TELL ME, WHEN DID YOU
BECOME SUCH AN ASSHOLE?

15:50.550 --> 15:54.021
I SIT IN THIS HOUSE
AND I SAY "GOD DAMN IT.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.456
WHAT IS THIS PUNISHMENT?"

15:56.556 --> 15:59.859
YOU ARE SO IMPATIENT
WITH THE KIDS

15:59.959 --> 16:02.862
AND IT PISSES ME OFF.
IT PISSES ME OFF

16:02.962 --> 16:05.232
THAT YOU ARE ENERGETIC
AND ALIVE IN THIS ROOM

16:05.332 --> 16:07.100
AND YOU'RE
AN OLD MAN AT HOME.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.037
YOU'RE AN OLD,
ANEMIC MAN, PAUL.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.571
YOU'RE ALWAYS TIRED!

16:11.671 --> 16:14.207
YOU'RE ALWAYS
TIRED FOR US.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.578
OKAY.

16:24.051 --> 16:27.587
MAYBE I HAVEN'T NOTICED.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.291
MAYBE THINGS HAVE
GOTTEN WORSE FOR MAX.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.065
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.201
OKAY?

16:53.180 --> 16:55.182
SO HOW'S ROSIE?

16:55.282 --> 16:57.250
HOW'S SHE?
HOW'S SHE DOING?

17:00.387 --> 17:02.355
ROSIE, YEAH,
SHE'S FINE, WHY?

17:02.455 --> 17:04.124
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT THAT THING

17:04.224 --> 17:06.326
AT THE--
AT THE YOUTH CENTER.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.098
YOU REALLY THINK
ROSIE CAN HELP

17:11.198 --> 17:13.100
RECOVERING DRUG ADDICTS?

17:14.434 --> 17:17.237
I MEAN...

17:18.371 --> 17:19.606
WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT SHE DOES THERE.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.475
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO SHE SEES THERE.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.378
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HER, PAUL?

17:25.478 --> 17:27.980
YOU COULD TRY TALKING
TO HER.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.916
SHE WOULD--
SHE WOULD LIKE THAT.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.219
SHE NEEDS THAT.

17:32.319 --> 17:36.223
ARE-- ARE YOU SAYING NOW
THAT I DON'T TALK TO ROSIE?

17:36.323 --> 17:37.790
FIRST OF ALL
I DON'T TALK TO MAX.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.460
NOW I DON'T TALK TO ROSIE.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.529
I WALK AROUND THE HOUSE
LIKE A BLIND MAN?

17:44.831 --> 17:46.599
DO I DISGUST YOU?

17:48.901 --> 17:52.071
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE. IT FEELS
LIKE I DISGUST YOU.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.907
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS,
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.576
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:56.676 --> 17:59.045
WHY DON'T WE EVER TALK?
WE NEVER TALK.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.214
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.627
OKAY.

18:14.727 --> 18:18.097
WE'VE GOT A FEW MINUTES,
LET'S-- LET'S TALK.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.145
OKAY.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.049
I'M SEEING SOMEONE.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.052
( scoffs )
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE--

18:40.153 --> 18:41.888
WHAT DO YOU THINK I MEAN?

18:53.533 --> 18:56.569
- WHO IS HE?
- SOMEONE I'M SEEING.

18:57.404 --> 19:00.072
WHO THE FUCK IS HE?!

19:00.173 --> 19:01.674
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.610
DON'T TELL ME WHAT
DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE!

19:03.710 --> 19:05.445
WHO THE FUCK IS HE?

19:06.913 --> 19:09.115
- HE'S DIVORCED, HE HAS A SON.
- DIVORCED.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.783
- HE'S 40 YEARS OLD.
- 40 YEARS OLD.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.885
WELL, AT LEAST YOU CAN'T
SAY HE'S AN ANEMIC OLD MAN.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.287
HE RUNS AN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.189
OH, MANAGES
AN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.492
- OKAY, WHERE DO YOU
MEET THIS GUY?
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

19:19.592 --> 19:22.895
DON'T KEEP SAYING TO ME
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE!

19:22.995 --> 19:25.164
WHERE THE FUCK
DO YOU MEET HIM?!

19:25.265 --> 19:27.567
- AT HIS PLACE.
- AT HIS PLACE.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.101
AND WHAT DO YOU
DO AT HIS PLACE?
WHAT DO YOU DO?

19:29.202 --> 19:30.870
- COME ON.
- NO, COME ON.

19:30.970 --> 19:34.307
I-- I WANT TO KNOW.
YOU MEET THIS GUY AT HIS
PLACE AND WHAT DO YOU DO?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.643
USE YOUR IMAGINATION, PAUL.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.678
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME YOURSELF,
YOU FUCKING LIAR?

19:38.778 --> 19:40.380
YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME
FOR THE LAST-- WHAT IS IT?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.282
TWO MONTHS,
SIX MONTHS, A YEAR?

19:42.382 --> 19:44.317
I WANT TO KNOW

19:44.417 --> 19:46.152
WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU MEET THIS GUY.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.020
STOP IT, JUST--

19:48.120 --> 19:51.658
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU GO TO HIS PLACE.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.860
I WANT EVERY DETAIL
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO BE LEFT SITTING ALONE

19:53.960 --> 19:55.995
TO IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE.
NOW YOU FUCKING TELL ME.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.864
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?

19:59.165 --> 20:01.468
HE LEAVES WORK,
I MEET AT HIS PLACE.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.936
AND IT DOESN'T TAKE US
MORE THAN AN HOUR.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.838
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANTED TO HEAR?

20:10.810 --> 20:13.212
HE MOVES DIFFERENTLY.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.248
HE DOES
EVERYTHING DIFFERENTLY

20:15.348 --> 20:17.617
AND THAT IS
WHAT MADE IT SO EXCITING.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.219
IS THAT-- IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.129
AND THAT I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT THE WAY HE LOOKS AT ME

20:30.229 --> 20:33.700
OR THE WAY
HE TOUCHES ME.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.703
HE KNOWS I'M MARRIED
AND THAT'S WHAT TURNS HIM ON.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.344
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANTED TO HEAR?

20:44.444 --> 20:46.212
YOU KNOW WHAT AMAZES ME?

20:46.313 --> 20:47.814
WHAT REALLY GETS ME

20:47.914 --> 20:50.717
IS THAT YOU CAN GO
TO THIS GUY'S PLACE

20:50.817 --> 20:53.686
AND THEN YOU CAN
COME HOME HERE ALL WET

20:53.786 --> 20:55.755
AND FLUSHED
AND EXCITED AND HORNY

20:55.855 --> 20:58.224
AND YOU CAN
SIT DOWN WITH OUR SON

20:58.325 --> 20:59.892
AND DO HIS HOMEWORK.
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

20:59.992 --> 21:03.496
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

21:03.596 --> 21:08.100
IT MAKES ME
FEEL LIKE SHIT.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.638
AND A WEEK LATER
I GO BACK AND I DO
IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

21:16.809 --> 21:20.046
I HOPE THAT'S NOT TOO
COMPLICATED FOR YOU
TO UNDERSTAND, PAUL.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.417
HAPPENS EVERY DAY,
DOESN'T IT?

21:24.517 --> 21:27.387
YOU KNOW, YOU--

21:27.487 --> 21:29.989
YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE THE GALL

21:30.089 --> 21:32.925
TO ACCUSE ME OF NEGLECT,

21:33.025 --> 21:35.362
OF LETTING YOU DOWN,

21:35.462 --> 21:38.097
OF LETTING DOWN OUR KIDS,
OUR FAMILY.

21:38.197 --> 21:40.066
WHATEVER I DID--
WHATEVER I DID,

21:40.166 --> 21:42.034
IT WAS NOT INTENTIONAL.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.103
BUT WHAT YOU DID
WAS DELIBERATE.

21:44.203 --> 21:47.273
YOU MADE A CHOICE--

21:47.374 --> 21:49.409
A DELIBERATE CHOICE
TO BETRAY ME...

21:49.509 --> 21:51.944
- ( sobbing )
- ...AND OUR KIDS.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.039
CONGRATULATIONS.

22:22.141 --> 22:25.412
YOU'VE MADE SURE
TO RUIN ANY CHANCE
OF SAVING THIS MARRIAGE.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.948
ME RUIN IT?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.586
OH, IT WAS RUINED ALREADY.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.924
WHAT-- WHAT I HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND...

22:40.026 --> 22:43.295
IS HOW YOU HAVE NOT
BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.432
AND WHAT'S HURT ME
THE MOST

22:45.532 --> 22:48.100
IS THAT YOU HAVEN'T HAD
A FUCKING CLUE.

22:49.536 --> 22:53.940
YOU SO DIDN'T
SUSPECT ANYTHING...

22:54.040 --> 22:56.909
BECAUSE IT NEVER EVEN
CROSSED YOUR FUCKING
PREOCCUPIED MIND

22:57.009 --> 22:59.646
THAT I COULD DO
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.164
IS IT OVER?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.536
ARE YOU GONNA
KEEP ON SEEING HIM?

23:28.508 --> 23:30.577
IT'S UP TO YOU.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.551
PLEASE LEAVE.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.823
( dogs barking )

24:20.927 --> 24:23.162
( door creaks )

24:37.409 --> 24:39.546
( knocking )

24:48.420 --> 24:50.523
HELLO.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.998
I DREAMT ABOUT BECCA AGAIN.

25:02.434 --> 25:04.571
- SAME DREAM?
- YEAH. YEAH.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.974
I'M IN A BOAT,

25:08.074 --> 25:10.643
SHE'S IN THE WATER.
I SEE HER DROWNING.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.615
I SAY TO MYSELF, "JUST--
JUST JUMP IN.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.818
SAVE HER."

25:18.918 --> 25:20.787
SOMETHING'S
HOLDING ME BACK.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.824
( theme music playing )
