03:00.600 --> 03:03.240

03:17.520 --> 03:21.000
However,
Eat eagle sable,

03:21.160 --> 03:24.680

13:00.480 --> 13:02.200
Hurry up and get up, Charlotte!
The place is filthy.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.440
Alright. Must pay book.

Yes, what I meant.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.840

not achieved, not sold.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.760

13:56.920 --> 13:58.200

I ask your grandfather about it
but change the subject.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.600
I do not know what it is.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.560
- Charlotte, go?
- Instantaneous.

14:16.760 --> 14:20.520
Casper wants to show us

Be careful, casper.
You are not very sporty.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.160
Hurry up and get it!

14:53.400 --> 14:56.200
- Be careful, Caspy.
- Do not drop it!

14:59.920 --> 15:01.800
It's very valuable.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.440
- Faster, constipatule!
- Hey, it is!

15:06.960 --> 15:10.400
- Zâmbiþi!
- Becky, this is dangerous.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.240
This is a great photo.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.840
Can I touch it?

15:16.080 --> 15:17.560
Alright.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.920
Bravo, vomit!

15:24.640 --> 15:26.080
- I'm sorry.
- Do not worry, Casp.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.040
You just need a broom
and adhesive tape.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.880
- We blestemaþi, Seth!
- Of course.

15:31.080 --> 15:34.840
I'm serious.
Urn containing demons

15:35.040 --> 15:37.400
which, when broken jars,
drop occurs and curse you!

15:37.560 --> 15:41.840
You mean they are
meet will kill

15:42.040 --> 15:43.840
and will return
zombie form?

15:44.040 --> 15:46.960
- What are the bad things you say!
- Zombie is the sunset.

15:47.120 --> 15:51.760
Talk about zombies owned
Devil ashes from the urn.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.080
Statham! So the zombie half
half demon.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.440
- I mean, "zemon".
- Yes.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.240
- No joke, guys!
- You're a joke.

16:00.680 --> 16:04.480
Instead of eating the brain to tell you,
Do you leave bite marks levels.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.000
If you bite,
Would want to kill myself.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.400
If you kill
You submit zemon.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.120
This makes no sense!

16:12.400 --> 16:14.720
The rule is that you can seduce them

16:14.920 --> 16:17.800
and if I smell fish franþuze,
be your slave.

16:17.960 --> 16:21.960
Everything will begin at midnight.

16:22.120 --> 16:25.840
- Seth ended up with counter cliche.
- Okay. Then, at 22?

16:26.040 --> 16:28.760
- Yes, I agree.
- Can participate.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.080
- We practice.
- Ten? It's too early.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.080
If you do not reverse the curse
wake up in the morning, we will blestemaþi forever.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.840
- What are condemned!
- This is a terrible curse.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.320
- Hands here!
- One, two, three ...

16:42.440 --> 16:44.440
Curse!

16:45.680 --> 16:48.240
- Lightning. God ...
- Dude, you're weird.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.160
- Need to find shelter.
- You're weird.

16:51.320 --> 16:55.000
- Quiet and You!
- Get out! Now!

16:55.200 --> 16:57.720
Quiet and You, Caspy.
Do not cry!

16:57.880 --> 17:00.880
Do not cry.
I was sweating eyes.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.280
- Get im!
- See you, Casper!

17:03.440 --> 17:06.960
Casper, nothing will happen.

17:07.119 --> 17:10.160
It would be nice for something to happen,
but it never happened.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.680
- Thank you for the book.
- Thank you.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.880
- Bye!
- Then, Cas!

17:22.640 --> 17:25.640
I'm sorry,
Mr. Satan in the box.

17:25.839 --> 17:28.880
A fix to get you home soon.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.280
Okay, Mr. Evil Spirit
ash urns.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.760
I say
-Did you fix the house, right?

17:35.960 --> 17:39.240
It is like new.
Do you wrap.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.320
- Hey! Dinner is ready.
- No time. I condemn.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.840
- Is homemade meatballs.
- How to get the hammer?

18:19.040 --> 18:21.000
Under the sink, my dear.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.800
Is so happy!
Grandfather called

18:23.000 --> 18:25.600
and said that he was proud of
that you enter the store.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.160
You're a wonderful guy,
dear.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.040
Casper?

18:36.080 --> 18:37.520
What, Becky?

18:37.760 --> 18:40.240
I'm going to build a fort
before at 22. You?

18:40.400 --> 18:44.600
Got a date? They turn
a curse on us. Soon!

18:47.200 --> 18:49.280
How to know
what color lipstick suits me?

18:49.440 --> 18:51.840
Choose red.
Now, choose the color pink fuchsia!

18:52.040 --> 18:55.000
I do not care for problems
lipstick on your ...

18:55.120 --> 18:57.520
Do not go out after 22 hours.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.160
I need a timer.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.520
Not out, not in zemoni.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.840
Casemate ready.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.760
There were nine minutes.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.800
Damn it! We need supplies.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.920
Never enough corn.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.840
Your grandfather was on the phone.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.200
Kid, how was your day?

19:35.360 --> 19:38.280
It was great.
There is nothing bad happens.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.360
I'm pleased.
And here is great.

19:41.560 --> 19:46.760
9:53? Congratulations! We must put
Appendix ice. I love you.

19:52.200 --> 19:59.800
Leaves, brittle and weak
until you see, mãreaþã yew.

20:01.960 --> 20:06.280
I could wear a cape
love you,

20:06.480 --> 20:11.800
then, like a leaf,
I was I could break my tree.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.720
- It was good.
- Really?

20:13.920 --> 20:16.960
I would change the "leaf"
weakest metaphor.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.280
- Owns and change anything.
- No? Thank you.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.120
How to move the party
on the balcony?

20:23.280 --> 20:25.160
Torþele light.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.440
Annual game
will begin,

20:36.640 --> 20:38.480
and Patrioþii
back in the red.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.240
Will they beat the other team
and will win the trophy?

20:42.480 --> 20:47.440
We shall see. Fans delirious,
and as a cheerleader.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.200
Shoes and you look like you!

20:53.760 --> 20:56.280
Food, check.
Toilet paper check.

20:57.280 --> 21:01.280
My paper, but my toilet.
I need the toilet.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.120
Mom, where a mop bucket?

21:14.280 --> 21:16.240
I'm ready.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.360
- Casper!
- No!

21:23.000 --> 21:25.160
You smoked pot, Casper?

21:25.360 --> 21:28.480
How are you, Mom?
Ameth? Whether you come to commit suicide?

21:28.640 --> 21:31.720
Do not change the subject.
Do you smoke?

21:31.840 --> 21:33.960
No. I've never smoked anything.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.640
Then why are you wearing
as a drug addict?

21:43.480 --> 21:46.720
It happened something bad
shop today.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.280
This is good
that you do not commit suicide.

21:51.480 --> 21:55.400
- Do not take it lightly Casper.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.920
Okay, honey.
Discussed after a shower.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.240
- Thank you.
- I love you, baby.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.000
And I love you, Mom.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.320
We do not blestemaþi.

22:16.120 --> 22:19.560
- You get some minunaþi eyes.
- Burt ...

22:21.280 --> 22:23.640
It will be rough when he would say

22:25.000 --> 22:28.120
I love you
at the top of your head?

22:29.880 --> 22:34.760
I'd say you're rude,
but it's early.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.600
After graduation, go.

22:38.160 --> 22:42.400
Immediately.
Wine talk.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.160
That's all right.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.080
That said,
I would like to propose a toast.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.920
My girlfriend Becky

23:00.120 --> 23:04.800
and moments
spent together!

23:18.880 --> 23:22.160
With it, telling you goodbye.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.720
See you! Alright.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.360
I do not know why I do this.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Not a chance.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.360
I got nothing.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.880
I do not have hope.

23:59.360 --> 24:03.400
All of it. If
Falling Patrioþii, trophy was theirs.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.040
Look at me!
It's time to shine and you, Tony.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.240
- We start two, okay?
- Of course.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.720
- To catch the ball at the moment.
- I've never dropped it.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.120
Pause!

24:16.640 --> 24:18.040
Began.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.240
Tornado 22.
Catch!

24:28.880 --> 24:30.520
Patrioþii!

24:30.720 --> 24:33.400
Essay!

24:34.200 --> 24:37.200
Tony Run
and encourage him.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.440
- I need this for a reason.
- Where are they going?

24:39.680 --> 24:43.480
Tony breakthrough
mark hair!

24:43.760 --> 24:47.520
- Tony has just pierced!
- Patrioþii!

24:49.080 --> 24:51.120
Nothing! Tony!

24:51.360 --> 24:53.880
Items!

24:54.120 --> 24:56.760
- Why?
- This is great!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.720
How disgusting!

25:02.400 --> 25:05.680
Can not ... God!

25:15.680 --> 25:17.400
I have to go.

25:18.520 --> 25:21.240
It gives, essays!

25:25.720 --> 25:28.720
Ready? Come, Pa ...

25:30.800 --> 25:33.240
Charlotte? I'm scared.

25:33.520 --> 25:37.120
Now I take this pen
and I'm going to stab him in the jugular.

25:39.080 --> 25:43.760
Knife ... What can I do?
Nonsense!

25:56.400 --> 25:58.120
"Hello? Here,
Seth cup super-store. '

25:58.160 --> 25:59.960
"We are dead after a cup."

26:00.120 --> 26:01.840
"Leave a message
and you call me. '

26:02.680 --> 26:04.040
Without hope.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.640
Do you pass the phrase "I told you I
they do not blestemaþi "Becky.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.640
Is everything okay?

27:18.720 --> 27:20.640
Say something, Mom.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.160
Get,
although it may seem strange.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.720
Do not make me use this.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.440
How disgusting!

28:34.880 --> 28:37.320
Today was the worst.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.560
Do not ... Mom!

28:55.600 --> 28:57.400
Please ...

28:58.760 --> 29:03.000
Damn it!
Please deer in pajamas.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.560
I'm sorry, sir.

29:07.200 --> 29:10.720
God!
It came out of nowhere.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.680
Forget the gun.
I've been duck hunting.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.560
E-caliber 12.

29:16.760 --> 29:21.800
Give it to me! I was invited
I pulled a few shots.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.840
That is so true.

29:32.680 --> 29:34.080
Casper ...

29:34.440 --> 29:36.880
Becky, I'm glad to see you.

29:37.440 --> 29:42.760
My mother has turned into zemon,
I ran, and now it is dead.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.840
God!
Casper, I'm so sorry.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.520
What crossbow?

29:47.720 --> 29:50.720
Burt. It ...
I do not know exactly what it is,

29:50.880 --> 29:53.000
but you're right.
We blestemaþi.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.920
- I know what happened.
- What about the others?

29:56.240 --> 29:57.400
Game!

30:14.200 --> 30:16.120
Damn ...

30:17.640 --> 30:20.600
We have a lot of problems.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.960
If you can not calm,
going to sleep again.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.480
Run! Get out of here!

30:43.680 --> 30:46.320
We have to move. Run!

30:59.280 --> 31:01.360
I do not believe
This occurs.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.840
Need to find Seth.

31:03.040 --> 31:08.080
- Please, call me and myself.
- No physical training.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.920
Seth, come on!
We have to move.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.680
- I found this phone.
- He's not here.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.320
Now what?

31:17.800 --> 31:20.600
First, you need to understand
what happened.

31:20.680 --> 31:23.880
- Mean?
- We blestemaþi.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.760
Sorry I do not believe,
Casper.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.560
All I say to the shop
happening now.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.640
I do not remember exactly what I said.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.880
The people you meet
will commit suicide.

31:35.080 --> 31:37.760
Going back as zemoni
and tried to kill us.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.640
- Whose idea was it to bite levels?
- It's my fault.

31:40.840 --> 31:44.480
Remember that you can smell them,
make them slaves vo and three.

31:46.560 --> 31:50.280
- It's my fault.
- I'll do anything.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.280
He was with his mother at 22.

31:59.680 --> 32:02.080
Attacked zemon a! Kill him!

32:02.280 --> 32:03.880
Sorry, Seth.
I think you zemon a.

32:04.040 --> 32:07.160
No, boys,
We will freeze the brain.

32:08.640 --> 32:13.360
Lucy was in my apartment.
Statham! It was the intervention?

32:13.520 --> 32:14.680
Where have you been, buddy?

32:14.880 --> 32:18.240
I have to ship the package.
"Package".

32:18.400 --> 32:20.400
Tell them that you have not seen
anyone.

32:20.840 --> 32:25.720
After I sent the package,
Polish Society cups,

32:25.880 --> 32:28.360
I came across a girl
who has asked me to guide him.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.320
I thought it was Swedish.

32:30.600 --> 32:35.360
Then I came across a man selling
Stolen Radio sidewalk.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.880
I made a good offer
a pair of speakers.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.360
Then I get some of your points
for brownies,

32:40.520 --> 32:42.000
Because I helped an old lady
to cross the street.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.680
- That bunaciune a.
- "Bunaciune"?

32:44.840 --> 32:47.480
- Yeah, who wants to O. ..
- Ready!

32:47.640 --> 32:50.360
Then I filled the cup
with delicious juices.

32:50.680 --> 32:54.680
Then I had a conversation
Cute clerk at the store

32:54.880 --> 32:56.960
scârbo about how and
are pretzels with salsa.

32:57.160 --> 33:00.840
You meet people atâþia
the street from the post?

33:01.040 --> 33:04.280
I almost forgot. In stores
hippie guy came,

33:04.440 --> 33:07.440
the buy bags
pretzels with salsa.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.080
Then we started talking
about cups and other rubbish,

33:10.240 --> 33:11.840
leading to a "conference"

33:12.000 --> 33:14.320
his friend Tito.

33:14.560 --> 33:18.480
Then I smoked marijuana
and I went home.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.840
With how many of them
You have a visual?

33:21.000 --> 33:24.200
In all, of course.
Eye contact is very important.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.120
Man!

33:28.120 --> 33:29.480
We're all going to die.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.560
No, it's one hipioþii
I told him.

33:32.800 --> 33:36.040
You are so smoking
You almost blue.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.880
That cargo Dazzle.

33:42.680 --> 33:45.800
- Very good.
- There zemon dragon!

33:46.000 --> 33:47.640
No. Please ...

33:53.960 --> 33:56.320
- His head is a good choice.
- Thank you.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.840
- A real curse, right?
- Yes.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.720
We have to move.

34:00.920 --> 34:03.480
To go to the store Casp grandfather.
There are books that can help.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.280
Not going back
the snake pit.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.720
This is a good time
to do, Patrick difficult.

34:09.719 --> 34:11.880
- Maybe we should go.
- Yes.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.960
You got that van
that you take the cup?

34:15.679 --> 34:17.280
Seth!

34:17.920 --> 34:20.840
Where the caravan key?

34:21.280 --> 34:23.239
- On the table?
- Office of the ...

34:23.400 --> 34:26.000
- I found it.
- They each took one pistol.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.040
Is that you?

34:39.560 --> 34:42.679
- Ninja Stars?
- They are sold on the internet.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.600
To battle!

34:49.719 --> 34:51.560
Awesome.

34:55.520 --> 34:56.920
Give it to me!

34:57.640 --> 34:59.000
Go, team!

34:59.360 --> 35:02.160
- Becky, Where is Casper?
- I get it.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.960
Come!

35:06.120 --> 35:10.480
- Casper, we have found.
- I can not do it, Becky.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.720
Go!
You have to fix what we broke.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.960
- It will not bring her back.
- I know. Come on!

35:16.120 --> 35:21.960
- No I do not ...
- Im going to work. Come on!

35:22.160 --> 35:23.320

35:23.440 --> 35:26.440

35:30.840 --> 35:33.960
- I'll get some and erveþele.
- Bravo!

36:00.080 --> 36:03.200
It could be better!

36:10.040 --> 36:12.120
God ...

36:14.160 --> 36:15.680
This is bad.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.920
This is very bad.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.760
- Move!
- Do not start.

36:36.240 --> 36:39.800
Let me me.
Give me the keys.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.000
Say "zemon"!

36:43.640 --> 36:45.720
Posting this picture!

36:50.600 --> 36:53.760
- Help me, Patrick!
- It's too late for you, Charlotte.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.880
- Patrick! Do something!
- Bye, Charlotte!

36:58.640 --> 37:01.240
- Take it, bitch!
- This will be useful for us.

37:01.640 --> 37:03.320
That's right

37:05.880 --> 37:07.160
Move!

37:07.600 --> 37:09.480
Let's get started!

37:12.320 --> 37:16.920
- Thank you for your help, Patrick.
- Guys, I'm hungry.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.360
- Hurry up and get it, dude.
- I tried what I could.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.320
- Let him go, Patrick!
- Parties who you, Charlotte?

37:26.240 --> 37:27.520
Potoliþi sure!

37:30.760 --> 37:32.960
Grandpa, what are you doing here?

37:33.200 --> 37:39.560
I came to bring the trophy.
What happened to the box?

37:39.720 --> 37:43.800
- It broke.
- Really? This is bad.

37:44.040 --> 37:47.480
- I knew that would be bad.
- But control.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.760
- Okay.
- That's good news.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.360
"Control" is good.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.320
Lock the doors.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.280
I'm good.

38:02.520 --> 38:06.200
- What is it?
- It zemon a.

38:08.440 --> 38:12.800
You need me to know exactly
What happens when you break the box.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.800
I made a joke about the curse
eye contact with people.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.520
When they saw, they killing
into demons and zombies.

38:22.720 --> 38:26.800
- Therefore the words "zemon".
- Do not forget bites levels.

38:27.040 --> 38:31.200
If you do not destroy the curse
dawn, we blestemaþi forever.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.800
Are you mocking spirit.

38:34.960 --> 38:38.520
Honestly, I think
that Casper laugh, your nephew

38:38.680 --> 38:41.800
- The curse was a joke.
- Sorry.

38:41.960 --> 38:47.680
What do you say when ash falls
down, so it happens.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.360
I know I'm bad.

38:53.640 --> 38:57.800
This book is ...
Help us.

39:00.520 --> 39:08.440
This spirit. A burnt rules
condemned.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.480
Items!

39:19.080 --> 39:22.320
It's so shiny!

39:24.280 --> 39:28.200
I looked into the eyes
all the time.

39:28.640 --> 39:33.160
- Curse complicated it cool.
- Really?

39:33.400 --> 39:37.080
Get the book!
We still have a chance.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.880
Do something!
Resuscitation, all!

39:40.360 --> 39:43.720
It is ironic ...

39:43.880 --> 39:46.040
We have guests.

39:50.200 --> 39:53.640
Not exactly my taste.
What to do?

40:02.320 --> 40:05.280
- God!
- Wait, Grandpa!

40:05.440 --> 40:10.800
Your grandfather was ...

40:10.960 --> 40:12.760
In what way?

40:13.080 --> 40:16.400
Must dig.

40:16.560 --> 40:18.160
Where?

40:18.520 --> 40:25.400
Must ... dig.

40:26.960 --> 40:30.800
Grandpa!
Do not ...

40:48.040 --> 40:52.360
Casper, you have here mutãmd
Before becoming zemon.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.640
- I'll make things right.
- I'm sorry, Casp.

40:57.720 --> 41:01.440
- Where can we?
- I do not know. I have an idea.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.520
- What do we have here?
- Does she look familiar?

41:05.720 --> 41:09.480
Urn containing demons
raging here in the beginning ...

41:09.640 --> 41:12.760
He was arrested by none other
than the grandfather of Casper.

41:12.920 --> 41:18.360
- He was a hero.
- But we can resolve the situation?

41:18.520 --> 41:20.320
Yes, but we have a lot to do
until sunrise.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.160
That is more than six hours
and 13 min.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.680
As you can capture the spirit
more

41:28.880 --> 41:32.440
must return the box
the following items.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.440
First, we need to
Other ash urns.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.520
- Ready.
- Okay.

41:39.720 --> 41:42.000
We need a new box
where to catch the spirit.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.880
I thought I saw something there.

41:47.920 --> 41:51.160
So we need a skull
man to close the ballot box

41:51.360 --> 41:53.800
and frog liver
that would give him a breath.

41:53.960 --> 41:56.000
- I have.
- Do you know where we picked up the skull?

41:56.200 --> 41:59.400
Laboratory of Anthropology.
If you come to class, you know. Go!

42:00.360 --> 42:02.880
And we need a clock

42:03.120 --> 42:05.840
since the last exorcism
spirit.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.920
Ie from grandfather
S Casper, right?

42:08.240 --> 42:09.760
Do you have any ideas?

42:10.480 --> 42:13.320
Gilbert called Galloway.
That's all I know.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.520
We are looking for a name
library.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.240
It seems again that
on campus.

42:17.320 --> 42:20.000
And I think
The place is useless.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.400
- Cut the list box.
- Doors!

42:33.160 --> 42:35.840
That seems a gold digger.

42:45.280 --> 42:48.120
Just when I thought
can not bear bad things.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.360
We need more guns!

42:51.680 --> 42:53.360
Choose!

43:07.040 --> 43:10.080
This is my weapon.
It's a bullet.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.040
Remember what I found!

43:14.360 --> 43:17.120
Grandpa left me to try.
There are four.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.400
Feeling they are trained,
but we have no place to go.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.760
- The door to the rear. Follow me!
- Fast!

43:26.800 --> 43:28.000
Do not move!

43:36.240 --> 43:38.280
No one stopped me!

44:19.280 --> 44:20.800
And so zemonii exploded ...

44:20.880 --> 44:23.800
- Lucy, be careful. Enter!
- Thank you, Seth.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.600
- The first woman.
- Go!

44:29.880 --> 44:32.080
Nothing! Grandpa!

44:33.960 --> 44:36.440
Gramps, please do!

44:36.680 --> 44:39.320
Not Dazzle!
I did it!

44:41.520 --> 44:44.640
- Grandpa!
- Come on, let's go!

44:56.040 --> 44:58.760
Casper, sorry
for your grandfather.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.360
Thank you.

45:05.280 --> 45:07.440
Ready. Stop!

45:08.920 --> 45:12.000
- Okay.
- What happened?

45:12.200 --> 45:14.120
I can not do that.
Let's go, Charlie.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.880
No, Patrick. Be
to stay together.

45:16.080 --> 45:20.560
- Come on, Charlotte!
- I do not want to go.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.640
I knew that night was difficult.

45:24.080 --> 45:27.360
I say do whatever
to save us.

45:29.120 --> 45:33.960
We can take from the beginning,
as before.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.560
What?

45:35.800 --> 45:40.440
Are you crazy? Patrick,
we're not in the ninth grade.

45:40.600 --> 45:43.560
Why and go with you,
Once you've been like this?

45:43.760 --> 45:48.960
Well, forget it!
Remember that there is something between us!

45:49.360 --> 45:51.440
It's obvious which side you are on.

45:51.600 --> 45:54.840
- It is not no party.
- Yes.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.480
In short, you can stay here,
Frico with your friends and,

45:58.640 --> 46:01.600
but the van went
to places better. Peace!

46:01.800 --> 46:04.680
- I'll do it.
- Shut up, dead!

46:04.840 --> 46:07.160
Let's see where ajungeþi
without a leader like me.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.400
Patrick, please
do not do anything stupid.

46:09.560 --> 46:14.760
Patrick! Where did they go?
Kidding me ...

46:15.000 --> 46:18.640
Charlie, the only reason
that I spent with you,

46:18.800 --> 46:22.160
was that they wanted to convince Lucy
to receive a threesome.

46:22.680 --> 46:25.400
- How disgusting!
- So, idioþilor!

46:28.160 --> 46:32.280
- God!
- Help! Charlotte!

46:38.160 --> 46:39.760
Not anymore ..

46:43.480 --> 46:45.480
That means you're single now?

46:45.640 --> 46:49.360
- Seth! It's not funny.
- Yes, it's meaningless.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.920
That and I think.
Somewhat.

46:58.600 --> 47:00.840
Statham!
Did you hear that?

47:00.960 --> 47:03.000
What? No.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.880
God!

47:11.280 --> 47:13.160
There are those who killed her mother.

47:13.360 --> 47:15.920
It was a bit of a child?

47:16.120 --> 47:17.800
Duck!

47:18.800 --> 47:21.720
God!
Wait!

47:21.920 --> 47:25.160
- How to use it?
- Pull the pin and throw it away!

47:26.320 --> 47:30.040
Þãrãnoilor!
It's for my mother.

47:38.440 --> 47:39.640
It worked.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.040
- It was awesome.
- I never do that.

47:50.280 --> 47:52.280
I almost liked.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.000
It was close.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.200
Why stop?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.600
You will're bad!

48:04.280 --> 48:07.000
If I knew that we had
dealing with the curse

48:07.160 --> 48:09.520
refueling.

48:10.520 --> 48:13.680
That's all right. Type
station in it.

48:13.840 --> 48:17.880
- It's almost asleep watching TV.
- Find and ronþãit something?

48:18.040 --> 48:20.840
- Words Are you serious, Seth?
- I am dying of hunger.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.920
- To encourage.
- I went to the pump. Ready!

48:25.080 --> 48:26.920
One, two, three ...

48:27.200 --> 48:28.560
"Emergency Meeting
fill "

48:28.720 --> 48:31.720
"The patients with self-inflicted wounds,
in the east of the city. '

48:31.920 --> 48:34.320
"Now back to the music."

48:35.160 --> 48:37.960
Want to know ... I can not handle
in such situations.

48:38.080 --> 48:40.720
Should relaxaþi,
Here we have $ 20 in gasoline.

48:40.840 --> 48:44.240
Avoid eye contact and go.
No big deal.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.040
I'm going to see my one eye
through this.

48:49.240 --> 48:51.640
Let's hope!

48:59.200 --> 49:02.360
Began. Maintaining and get back to me!

49:04.200 --> 49:09.520
Good evening, sir.
$ 20 gasoline, please!

49:09.680 --> 49:11.200
Lovely caravan!

49:11.360 --> 49:15.200
Yes, he's right
Snoring like a cat.

49:15.360 --> 49:18.240
You should check the price.

49:18.360 --> 49:21.920
You know what? I think you already have some
purple glasses, so ...

49:22.040 --> 49:24.120
Too small for my face.

49:24.280 --> 49:27.080
- Do not want it.
- Then $ 20.

49:27.160 --> 49:29.200
I got something in my eye.

49:29.280 --> 49:34.680
- And my eyes înþeapã.
- You do not say!

49:35.200 --> 49:37.640
I stood on oil!

49:38.800 --> 49:41.560
You do not have no respect
for history.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.760
- Do not Quit! God!
- We go to plan B.

49:43.920 --> 49:46.000
- We have a plan B?
- No

49:46.640 --> 49:49.400
- Collect dirt!
- Hurry up and get up, Seth!

49:52.240 --> 49:53.600
Casper!

49:54.160 --> 49:55.640
Your hands.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.560
You Calcutta, weird!

49:58.720 --> 50:01.440
Plecaþi here, you bastard.

50:01.640 --> 50:03.760
Thanks for gasoline.

50:05.400 --> 50:08.600
- Seth, hurry!
- Wine. Start!

50:16.280 --> 50:18.520
It was beautiful,
but the mission is accomplished.

50:18.720 --> 50:21.240
Just because you do not accidentally
I had eye contact with him.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.640
Wear,
so it should be fine.

50:25.720 --> 50:27.920
People?

50:49.720 --> 50:52.920
I'm not working headset.

50:53.680 --> 50:56.080
We even gasoline.

51:03.080 --> 51:06.760
Seth, Lucy, went to the lab
and contact the frog heart.

51:06.920 --> 51:10.480
Charlotte and Becky, look for information
Gilbert of Galloway.

51:10.600 --> 51:13.880
- Casper, guard and your van.
- Perfect. And the skull?

51:14.000 --> 51:16.320
I knew exactly where it was kept
My anthropology professor.

51:16.480 --> 51:20.520
- Must stay together.
- Not Casper. Follow the plan.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.920
College will be full
with zemoni.

51:23.120 --> 51:25.120
You already know what's going on
when Patrick left alone.

51:25.240 --> 51:28.640
- No time, Casper!
- Do not say I did not warn you.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.520
What do you mean?

51:31.040 --> 51:35.160
I have not heard this poll.
Look what followed!

51:35.320 --> 51:37.560
- That's not fair.
- Oh, right.

51:37.760 --> 51:40.000
I never wanted to take the urn.

51:40.240 --> 51:45.520
- Do you blame me?
- I said that.

51:45.720 --> 51:47.520
Come on, Becky.

51:48.280 --> 51:54.920
- I said that!
- You make me sick.

52:03.960 --> 52:07.960
Stay calm.
We will be back soon.

52:14.680 --> 52:17.200
I'm not saying that.

52:18.240 --> 52:19.760
Gross!

52:19.960 --> 52:22.080
I never dissected
a frog?

52:24.200 --> 52:26.280
That's funny. Here!

52:26.440 --> 52:28.000
I threw up in my mouth.

52:28.160 --> 52:31.360
After tonight,
everything seems easier.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.480
'Ll probably exceeded one.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.160
Not likely,
because you're perfect.

52:39.920 --> 52:43.200
- Really?
- Yes, privinþele all.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.440
Let's get to the heart!

52:45.760 --> 52:47.560
After completion of printing,

52:47.720 --> 52:50.040
back
and analyze what we have.

52:50.160 --> 52:51.960
It is a good plan.

52:52.240 --> 52:55.560
Casper I want to say,
I took my mouth before.

52:55.920 --> 53:00.320
I know. Poor and missing
and mother and grandfather.

53:00.680 --> 53:04.800
- Yes.
- Casper where his father?

53:05.080 --> 53:08.400
She died in front
when Casper little.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.720
Yes, it has happened
Occult in the barn.

53:11.880 --> 53:13.560
That Casper
so excited.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.960
That's why I'm scared
grandfather's shop.

53:18.080 --> 53:20.160
It makes sense.

53:22.360 --> 53:26.880
That crow?
Or hawk?

53:30.080 --> 53:33.400
Radio ...
It will calm down.

53:33.520 --> 53:35.040
"Everyone is dead.
Are're all dead. '

53:35.160 --> 53:36.800
No.

53:37.960 --> 53:41.280
As a resident you?
Patrick and I. ..

53:41.880 --> 53:46.560
Trying to find a way
We broke up for a long time.

53:46.840 --> 53:51.000
I never imagined
that would be so horrible.

53:51.320 --> 53:54.200
Let's get out of here,
before roads and new.

53:54.280 --> 53:57.720
- I took the paper.
- I keep the door

54:01.720 --> 54:04.720
Here!
Frog heart.

54:04.880 --> 54:09.680
- How small is it?
- I know. A and A. .. Thank you.

54:15.720 --> 54:19.360
You're great.

54:33.840 --> 54:36.080
What a surprise, Mr. Galloway!

54:36.280 --> 54:38.760
Mâzgãliþi in an area
unauthorized parking.

54:38.920 --> 54:40.200
Mr. Professor Duffy
You see here?

54:40.400 --> 54:43.520
Newspapers.
Your job is not stacking.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.160
Are you in danger.

54:45.400 --> 54:49.920
Go home, încuiaþi door
and windows, hide your dog ...

54:50.120 --> 54:51.800
That is another reason

54:51.960 --> 54:53.640
the fact that you have taught
work?

54:53.800 --> 54:55.480
- No, sir.
- Okay.

54:55.680 --> 54:59.640
Because I'll get a little ...
Look at me when you speak!

54:59.760 --> 55:01.320
Trust me, do not want that.

55:01.480 --> 55:05.200
I am older than you,
even if it does not show my age.

55:05.360 --> 55:08.600
I'll never forget me in your
Never!

55:08.760 --> 55:13.400
- Are you on weed?
- He said: "You smoked marijuana."

55:13.560 --> 55:16.120
Why spuneþi you all?

55:18.000 --> 55:22.360
Moving the machine
the official parking.

55:23.800 --> 55:27.320
Sir, I need to think about
beautiful things.

55:27.480 --> 55:30.480
Alright. I have to go.
I do not know where, but go.

55:30.600 --> 55:32.720
No, Duffy! Wait!

55:42.080 --> 55:46.760
I get it.
It's time to woo and subdue.

55:46.920 --> 55:53.000
Joshy, many years to you too!

55:57.920 --> 56:01.360
Þuguie lips, boy!

56:01.440 --> 56:03.480
I do not think it's a good idea.

56:08.680 --> 56:11.440
- Merge.
- Really?

56:17.040 --> 56:20.000
Is the nose touch!

56:26.800 --> 56:28.760
Jump!

56:29.360 --> 56:31.360

56:33.400 --> 56:34.840
Okay, you stop!

56:34.960 --> 56:37.280
Massaging my back!

56:41.160 --> 56:44.360
Reminds me of that night.
Does it remember?

56:44.480 --> 56:47.040
Dad ...
Go for the weekend ...

56:47.360 --> 56:51.320
Your hands ...
Don 't forget to get your hands on, Josh.

56:51.520 --> 56:54.400
A and A. ..
You know what I like.

56:54.480 --> 56:57.720
I do not see that!
For me and?

56:57.760 --> 57:00.400
- So, Josh.
- Get back!

57:00.800 --> 57:04.400
Josh fuguþa sites in the shower!

57:11.680 --> 57:14.600
Why would you do that, Seth?
Become our slaves.

57:14.720 --> 57:17.480
I will not leave zemon slave
dirty to my boyfriend.

57:17.680 --> 57:20.400
Who says your boyfriend?

57:23.920 --> 57:26.640
Think about the things you beautiful
Duffy.

57:41.920 --> 57:44.800
It's time. God!

57:53.160 --> 57:57.200
Being in the neutral zone.

58:02.520 --> 58:05.240
God, what scârbo and Enie!

58:09.880 --> 58:12.600
I seduce one player zemon
and I made my slave.

58:12.760 --> 58:16.080
- Really? God!
- Casper!

58:20.840 --> 58:25.640
- E Professor Duffy?
- Yes. I survived.

58:26.880 --> 58:31.920
I know it seems horrible situation.
I will not lie. Totally e

58:32.240 --> 58:38.360
But I was saved but the van.

58:41.720 --> 58:48.080
I'm sorry for what I said.
I mean it.

58:48.280 --> 58:51.760
We are all involved
and without you,

58:52.160 --> 58:57.880
I have managed to get
in here. Thank you.

59:01.440 --> 59:04.360
I thin that the leg
for this?

59:06.600 --> 59:10.080
Casper, you little ...
brain compared.

59:10.240 --> 59:13.600
- Brain? Where? Here?
- There's more.

59:13.760 --> 59:15.480
Yes, it's everywhere.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.160
You have less.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.840
Fugiþi, guys!

59:41.400 --> 59:42.800
Where Dazzle?

59:52.440 --> 59:54.960
Leave her alone! Start!

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:06.560
You're right, Casp.
School met.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.760
- You shot innards?
- What?

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.200
Your stomach ...
You shoot them?

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:18.920
No. I was a little damaged.
I will rest.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.160
I am very tired.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.440
Zemonii interesting sometimes.
Esc wrong?

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.840
Let's see what we got here.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Here's what I found
Gilbert of Galloway.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.840
Look at these old photos Casp.
Like you.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.560
We know where he is buried,
but that's all I know.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.680
- To dig. That's it!
- What?

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.680
Missing elements: a pocket watch.
Having your own hours.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.640
Grandpa says something about
Grandfather, before he died.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.920
It seems silly,
but now connects.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.080
- You said it was buried?
- Yes.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.200
It is buried
hours.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.920
This grandfather effort
to tell me.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.320
Must go
to dig his grandfather.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.520
Tonight,
with lopeþi.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.520
- Where?
- Cliff Dagger Cemetery.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.080
Blow it, Seth!

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.920
A cemetery in the middle
zemoni outbreak. What door greeting!

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.600
Dazzle, what are you doing?

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.000
The view!
What does it look like?

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.920
It seems that you are ready
jump out the window.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.800
- Yes. A to jump.
- Do not you think, Dazzle.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.560
- Let me go!
- Do not do it!

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.600
Dazzle, what are you doing?

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.560
My adventure with the skull ...
This does not work well.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.440
Zemoni everywhere.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.680
The skull was not there,
So how should.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.320
Then, some zemoni playing football
using the skull as a ball.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.200
Zemonul QB I see
and threw the skull.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.040
Got it
and I started running.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.040
- So what's wrong?
- I'm greedy, Becky.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.800
Zemonul Tiffany looked at me.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.280
Then I remembered
usually tempted,

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.320
So I decided to try.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.880
I think I can,
however, in the end, she seduced me!

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.280
His tongue was crazy
and, then ...

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.760
I bit my cat!

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.240
I said, "Damn, Tiffany zemon
just bite me how! '

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.400
- Wait! How do cats bite?
- I bite cat penis.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.360
A and Continues.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.600
I grabbed her breasts
and I threw it as there.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.600
I called this movement
"Throw in the breast".

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.760
Zemonii started after me,
and you know what followed.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.560
Now think
just committed suicide.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.560
- Dazzle, stop!
- Ready!

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:51.520
I was told that I could not control.
Guys, I made a sudden fear.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.640
Do not leave your
to commit suicide.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.320
We have some ointment here?
Penis sting me.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.000
We skull, heart
frogs, and ash urns.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.600
We lost items.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.120
If you say I'm going to dig
on my grandfather today ...

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.440
I do not believe
No Grandpa.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.040
You believe your grandfather.
And I believe.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.560
- Really?
- Yes.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.920
I think you're a great guy.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:43.200
Lucy, you have to forgive me.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.000
- For what?
- For this.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.360
I can not master.
So, baby!

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.680
- Vine and suicidal maniacs.
- Will get the ax.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.440
Duck!

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.200
I just hit a friend
the face with a shovel.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.600
God!
Dazzle hit me in the head.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.040
- I think the bleeding.
- Seth, look at this!

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:16.760
- I swear that bloody.
- I just hit a basket ciugul.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.000
Officially inform you that
I lost my appetite.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.960
Gilbert? Is your grandchild.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.360
I'm sorry that meet
in these circumstances.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.400
This pocket watch.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.360
Statham! Burt?

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.560
This should be a poem?

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.600
Back! Sounds like a job for
for zemoni tease.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.480
Hi, zemon Burty!

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.480
Stop it!

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.120
Stop you!
To tell you should be ashamed

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.120
that of all the girls,
Lucy biting as

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.280
and screamed and
comporþi're stupid.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.480
- It does not work.
- You did great.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.280
You act impressive.
It was very good.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.560
- I tried.
- You did great.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.640
Burt, pass
through a lot of weight now.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.960
If you love Me, ye
and me more space.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.800
I know I am.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.960
I want to go.
Please go away!

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.640
I'm sorry.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.560
I go, Seth.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.800
- Do not go. Lucy!
- We'll always have the heart of a frog.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.840
Do not say that, Lucy.
It will be fine, you'll see.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.360
She's so tiny!

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.880
Seth, I gotta go.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.400
Do what you want,
I stay here forever.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.200
Seth, I will change
zemon a.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.480
- There is Lucy.
- Yes, it's Hey, Lucy!

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.920
- No
- Statham!

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.560
I learned from the best.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.320
Þuguie lips!
It's time to woo and subdue.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.200
Inside.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.680
God!

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.240
How disgusting!

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.520
Go!
I think it worked.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.800
Raise your hand!

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.120
It worked.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:37.760
I have zemon slaves.
You watch!

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:44.800
Give me to introduce you
zemon slave Lucy.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.280
- I think we have a stable relationship.
- Good. Now we can go?

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.440
Guys, where Dazzle?

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.360
Is the tree, with bees.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.200
Not bees Dazzle! You are allergic.
Are you allergic to bees.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.560
I know. But I say
I could not restrain myself.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:26.160
Why bees?
My eyes! Nose!

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:30.279
Nose! My ears!

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.720
Anything but not bees.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.160
Bees ...

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.040
Casper ... Promise me something.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.200
Whatever Dazzle.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.160
Promise you post this picture.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.080
I promise.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.359
Sun almost dawn.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.880
If we do not hurry,
blestemaþi will be forever.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.520
Have to deal with the Dazzle.
He knows the plan.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.040
When you make zemon,
will do anything to stop us.

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:25.720
- I can try to seduce her.
- It is dangerous and disgusting.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.279
I'm glad you said that.
It would be very strange and I. ..

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:33.120
Go to the van and prepare
elements. I'll take care of Dazzle.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.399
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.200
Close the curtains.
To create an atmosphere.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.000
Good for meetings.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.480
- 'S The only way it will work.
- E as in "Racing-Back 101".

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.120
Thank you for saving me
Grandfather, Dazzle.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.560
You did the right thing.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.080
Ready. Get in there.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.760
That you have to keep
away from us.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.640
All right.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.720
Everything is ready.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.680
I dealt with it.

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.520
According to the book,

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.880
We must put all
in the box and have it sealed to the skull.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:04.120
- Where's the box?
- Last time it was Lucy, right?

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.800
Dazzle broke into his head.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.280
- Mm made bucãþele.
- We have another box?

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.840
- Great!
- Now what?

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.600
- Seth, you're right.
- Yes?

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.160
There never know when you might need
cup of hot dogs.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.520
- A jar of Vienna.
- Each to pick up items.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.720
- First, the ashes
- I.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.280
Then the frog heart.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.640
Then we need to watch,
To give time back.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.920
I've got.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.240
Finally, a human skull,
to seal the ballot box.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.320
Bring it, Casp!

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.240
Please leave it,
Hot Dog-Mm channels.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.920
- Does it work?
- Of course he went.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.560
Guys ... Lucy still zemon.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.800
No time for that.
What should I do?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.480
Statham!
This book appears otherwise.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.760
- A star.
- I hate them.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.040
What does it say?

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:23.040
"To undo the curse and
settled would be damned ... '

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.440
- What should I do?
- What?

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.360
"... We have to make sacrifices and live."

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.400
One of our own
to kill?

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.360
- This is crazy.
- There must be another way.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.040
- There's no time.
- Wait, Casper!

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.400
Almost dawn appears.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.200
- I did.
- No

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.880
I am the one that you put
story.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.240
- Casper, will not let you do that.
- I have.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:06.080
Everything will be okay.
I promise.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.440
Please ...

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:19.240
Seth, take care of her.
Thiele successfully and Lucy!

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.120
I know.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.440
Here you go. Something
remind me to tell you.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.160
Happy
I met tonight.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.160
I?

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.880
Supposed to be funny, not weird.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.920
That's perfect.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.280
Thank you.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.800
Three minutes.

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:04.240
Casper ... I'll kill you
with a rolling pin?

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.160
Right.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.000
- Crossbow?
- You have another good idea, Seth?

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.360
- It will go away.
- Of course.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.720
It would be great.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.880
Patrick? Beware!

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.720
Becky! Nothing!

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.280
- Patrick?

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.360

This is the sexy girl.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.160
Becky! Becky, do not!

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:00.280
- Becky, please, wait!
- It's okay, casper.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:05.720
I can not do that, Becky.
Do not leave me.

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.080
- Explode, Caspy!
- No

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.080
I love you.

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.200
- Please ...
- It's okay.

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.760
Casper, be careful!

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.400
Grenada ...

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.280
Stop it!

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:08.040
How threesome,
Patrick? One, two, three.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.000
Casper, catch!

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.240
Let me go, Dazzle!
Please!

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.000
Help me, brother!

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.520
I know you were there.
Dazzle!

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:49.880
Please! Again.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.600
Zemonii destroyed and i

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.800
Casper!

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.040
Wake up! I'm here.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.080
- You did.
- We live, man.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.480
- I'm dead?
- You're a hero.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.760
- Where all zemonii?
- Missing.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.440
You did, Casp.
You saved us.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.240
- How cute!
- I'm proud of you, Casper.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.480
The pictures have disappeared.
In 1000

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.280
Casp, everything is back to normal.
Do not change anything.
1.001

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.040
- Virtually no.
- Really?
1.002

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.280
Yeah, well ...
1.003

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.960
Now you have a story
for Duffy, Casp.
1.004

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.200
Casper, you are so handsome
when you step on stage!
1.005

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.800
- Your father would be proud of you.
- Thank you, ma'am.
1.006

Here, Mr. Galloway!
Is he going to be a record 10,
1.010

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.800
but the story of "zemonii"
He seemed to me excessive,
1.011

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.280
although I liked
Exhaust pipe.
1.012

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.440
Beautiful and charming.
Success!
1.013

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.840

Good luck in the future!

- Wait to lift my skirt.
- Are you ready?
1.021

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.080
Casper, be careful.
1.022

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:55.680
Ladies, there
interested in threesomes.
1.023

01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.640
What if you take a friend ziceþi
and do it in four?
1.024

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.240
- What a loser!
- I know.
1.025

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.160
He slipped a bullet.
Let's go!

Yes, way!

Hey, kids! What are you doing?
1.028

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:29.440
I'm sorry I came. I
care to leave the store.
1.029

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.120
In fact, that's why I came.
1.030

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.240
Now that we are graduates,
hope
1.031

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.960

Be sure to shop?

You have to get the money
