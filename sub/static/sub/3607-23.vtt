WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.294
Previously on Lost:

00:15.224 --> 00:16.849
I found the wire on the beach.

00:16.934 --> 00:20.853
I thought it might have something to do
with a transmission we picked up,

00:20.938 --> 00:24.357
a Frenchwoman
repeating on a loop for 16 years.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.733
Has it been that long?

00:25.818 --> 00:28.152
Have you seen other people
on this island?

00:28.237 --> 00:32.990
No. But I hear them. They whisper.

00:33.075 --> 00:35.618
- We need to get off.
- Are you suggesting something?

00:35.703 --> 00:38.121
Yeah. We build a raft.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.541
- You're making a lot of progress.
- Yeah, trying.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.376
Got this bamboo for the decking,

00:43.460 --> 00:46.295
a piece of the fuselage for the cabin.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.964
It'll work. We can do this.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.757
It's raining every afternoon.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.802
That means that we are on
the cusp of monsoon season.

00:52.886 --> 00:57.181
Why are we listening to Arzt? You're
a damn high school science teacher.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.142
I was assuming you didn't want to die.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.145
- So when do we have to leave?
- Yesterday.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.208
Yeah! All right!

01:25.002 --> 01:27.795
- What're you doing?
- Watching TV.

01:27.880 --> 01:31.883
- Yeah! Oh, yeah!
- The power's amazing!

01:31.967 --> 01:35.011
Oh, man, you see what time it is?
Go back to sleep, Walt.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.429
I always watch this show.

01:36.513 --> 01:40.808
OK, then.
At least turn it down?

01:45.647 --> 01:47.440
I said turn it down.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.902
- Brian lets me watch it as loud as...
- I'm not Brian.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.571
- Dang.
- Let's go, Vincent.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.031
Hey, where are you going?

01:56.575 --> 01:59.952
- Get away. Leave me alone.
- Don't even... Don't you think...

02:00.037 --> 02:02.455
- I said get away.
- Don't you walk away.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.624
I don't think so.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.918
- Get off of me.
- I don't like this either.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.711
- You're getting on the plane.
- What's going on?

02:09.797 --> 02:13.591
- It's OK. I'm his father.
- You're not my father!

03:43.265 --> 03:45.182
- Dad, wake up!
- What?

03:47.394 --> 03:48.936
Somebody's here.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.399
Hey! Stop!

03:54.484 --> 03:56.694
Slow, slow down.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.908
- Who is that?
- Must be the French chick.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.243
Calm down, everyone. It's all right.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.578
Fine. OK.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.673
Danielle?

04:26.308 --> 04:27.975
What are you doing here?

04:30.687 --> 04:32.772
The others are coming.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.250
Our ship went aground

04:53.335 --> 04:56.629
on this island 16 years ago.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.589
There were six of us.

04:58.674 --> 05:02.426
My team. Six.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.887
By that time,

05:04.972 --> 05:07.223
I was already
seven months pregnant.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.102
I delivered the infant myself.

05:13.522 --> 05:16.691
The baby and I were together
for only one week,

05:16.775 --> 05:19.485
when I saw black smoke.

05:20.862 --> 05:24.949
A pillar of black smoke
five kilometers inland.

05:27.411 --> 05:31.080
That night, they came.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.919
They came and took her.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.588
Alex.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.259
They took my baby.

05:45.095 --> 05:49.015
And now they're coming again.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.809
They're coming for all of you.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.688
- Who's coming?
- The others.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.857
You have only three choices.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.943
Run.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.611
Hide.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.948
Or die.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.910
This woman blew up her own shelter.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.872
Now she talks about black smoke
and hearing whispers.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.832
She's not playing with a full deck.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.460
That doesn't mean
what she's saying isn't true.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.253
You can focus on the "what ifs."

06:19.337 --> 06:23.299
I'm sticking with the tangible,
and that's the launching of the raft.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.718
- How's it going?
- I wanted to get off today,

06:25.802 --> 06:29.388
but realistically, man,
after we get the rudder done,

06:29.473 --> 06:32.516
we still gotta lay the rails
to get her down to the water.

06:32.601 --> 06:36.395
Wouldn't it save time to lay the rails
while you finish the rudder?

06:36.480 --> 06:38.397
Manpower shortage.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.108
What do you need?
To lay the rails and move the boat?

06:41.193 --> 06:44.653
Get it all done today?
Pretty much everybody.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.949
All right, give me 20 minutes.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.579
Grab as many palm tree logs
as you can find,

06:53.663 --> 06:56.040
the longer the better,
over to the raft area.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.250
- Michael knows what to do.
- See ya then.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.544
You need to get 'em in there tight,

07:00.629 --> 07:02.755
and leverage to get 'em on the rails.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.259
That's good.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.679
OK, that's good, man.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.767
Just get it under there. OK.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.894
- You all right?
- Yep.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.437
So listen, on my count,

07:18.522 --> 07:22.274
I'll do, "one, two, three, lift,"
and then push, OK?

07:22.359 --> 07:25.653
Got it? Come on.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.615
Once it's down to the water line,
we'll drop it and load it up.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.034
All right. Ready?

07:36.123 --> 07:37.248
One.

07:39.876 --> 07:40.918
Two.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.712
Three. Lift!

07:51.847 --> 07:53.180
Push!

07:54.558 --> 07:57.560
Push! Come on, guys.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.311
Push.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.358
Use the levers.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.947
Yeah. Good, good.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.534
One, two, three, lift.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.619
Hey, keep it straight.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.880
Oh, no! Come on! I can't believe this.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.006
Can't believe it.

08:27.090 --> 08:30.092
- What are you looking at me for?
- You missed the lever!

08:30.177 --> 08:33.888
- You couldn't keep the raft straight!
- I couldn't keep it straight?

08:33.972 --> 08:35.931
Dad! Look.

08:59.456 --> 09:03.125
- How many of them are there?
- I told you all I know.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.586
There has to be more to tell.
How did you know?

09:05.670 --> 09:07.379
You have a bigger problem.

09:07.464 --> 09:11.342
I can vanish into the jungle,
but I'm just one person.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.177
You have 40 people.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.555
Where will you hide them?

09:28.902 --> 09:31.445
Dude. Whoa.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.286
What is this?

09:40.121 --> 09:41.705
We hoped you could tell us.

09:41.790 --> 09:45.209
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Question.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.587
How do you know we can
all, like, fit in there?

09:48.672 --> 09:52.841
No handle on outside, must be another
way in. Another entrance means space.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.678
This is a mistake.
We don't know about these others.

09:55.762 --> 10:00.516
We're reacting with no information,
no intelligence. This might be theirs.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.726
Black smoke doesn't mean...

10:02.811 --> 10:05.104
- It means they're coming.
- Yeah, we got that.

10:05.188 --> 10:08.774
You booby-trapped your shelter
with explosives. Have any more?

10:10.819 --> 10:13.946
Dynamite. At the Black Rock.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.365
The Dark Territory.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.535
That's three reasons to go right there.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.288
If we're to make it back by sunset,

10:22.372 --> 10:24.415
we have to leave within the hour.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.563
Tequila and tonic with a wedge of lemon.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.738
Why were you yelling?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.994
The girl at the check-in counter.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.288
You were yelling at her.

11:05.874 --> 11:10.002
Sorry... do I know you?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.588
I'm on your flight. LA.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.925
So, your dad died?

11:20.430 --> 11:23.057
I thought you didn't hear
what I was yelling about.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.142
I was being polite.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.606
Yeah, my dad died.

11:31.566 --> 11:32.608
How?

11:34.444 --> 11:35.819
A heart attack.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.158
Not a drinker?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.244
No, not really.

11:49.042 --> 11:53.003
No ring 'cause you're single
or because you don't like wearing one?

11:54.964 --> 11:56.507
You asking me if I'm married?

11:57.467 --> 11:58.801
Are you married?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.638
No, not anymore.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.354
Can we get another
tequila and tonic, please?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.317
I didn't think you were listening.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.906
- So, what's your name?
- Ana-Lucia.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.242
So, tell me, Ana-Lucia,

12:23.326 --> 12:25.452
why are you drinking tequila and tonics

12:25.537 --> 12:30.082
- at ten to noon?
- I hate flying.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.419
And they stuck me all the way
in the back of the plane

12:33.503 --> 12:36.463
where the wheels come down
right under your damn feet.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.299
So, where are you sitting?

12:42.595 --> 12:43.929
23 B.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.599
42 F. Wanna trade?

12:52.981 --> 12:57.443
Hey. Yeah, I'm in Sydney. Hold on.

12:58.987 --> 13:02.072
- Sorry...
- Jack.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.825
Jack. I gotta talk.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.454
We'll have the next drink
on the plane, OK?

13:08.538 --> 13:12.332
- 42 F.
- 42 F. Right.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.753
And Jack?

13:17.881 --> 13:19.882
The worst part's over.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.142
They stuck me all the way
in the back of the plane.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.644
Look, I know you're all scared.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.980
I know everybody has a lot of questions.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.861
All I can tell you now
is we do have a plan.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.197
We have to go into
the jungle for supplies.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.324
We'll be back in a few hours.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.534
In the meantime,
do everything you can

13:47.619 --> 13:49.495
to help get that raft on the water.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.664
And after that, go to the caves.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.919
We'll be back
as soon as we can. I promise.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.756
Hey, nice speech.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.258
Plan's a little flawed,
but nobody's perfect.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.511
- My plan?
- Your plan. Go in the jungle,

14:05.595 --> 14:07.930
and get dynamite
and blow open a hatch,

14:08.056 --> 14:10.766
and then hide everyone inside.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.310
You wanna keep a secret,
don't tell the fat guy.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.689
What do you want, Arzt?

14:17.774 --> 14:20.359
God knows how long
that dynamite has been out there.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.402
And from what I can tell, Madame Nutso

14:22.487 --> 14:25.322
doesn't seem too concerned
with how to handle it.

14:25.406 --> 14:29.910
So unless you want to blow up,
I'm coming with you.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.581
OK. Grab some water bottles.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.416
We're leaving in a half an hour.

14:38.586 --> 14:42.214
We can salvage the cables but
we need new bamboo for the mast.

14:44.425 --> 14:48.011
We need to fix the rudder
before we think about that.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.890
- You need help?
- Let's get this done first.

14:51.975 --> 14:55.686
Hey, this wasn't my fault.
So put me to work.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.230
No offense.
We just work faster this way.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.026
All right! What do you think
I'm doing over here?

15:07.490 --> 15:09.241
You remember me?

15:10.076 --> 15:11.368
Three nights ago.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.870
You were hauled in here
thrashing and fighting.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.873
As you were being escorted by,
you kicked my desk.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.377
And you broke my mug.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.004
Nice kids.

15:22.088 --> 15:26.592
Sadly for you, breaking my mug was not
the most significant mistake you made.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.219
Come on, doctor.
I got into a bar fight.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.597
Ain't that a badge
of honor in this country?

15:31.681 --> 15:33.890
You know who you
head-butted in that bar?

15:33.975 --> 15:36.685
You headbutted
the Honorable Warren Truss...

15:38.313 --> 15:41.398
...Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Forestry.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.859
- The most important...
- He head-butted me.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.361
We have witnesses.
He did no such thing.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.572
'Course.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.950
You think this is funny, James?

15:55.622 --> 15:58.874
James Ford. Assault, wire fraud,

15:58.958 --> 16:01.877
identity theft, bank fraud,
telemarketing fraud...

16:01.961 --> 16:05.464
- This going someplace?
- You're a blight, a stain, scavenger.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.883
You're a con man preying
on the weak and needy.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.969
Tell me something, James,
how do you live with yourself?

16:11.054 --> 16:13.680
- I do just fine.
- Do you?

16:16.142 --> 16:19.144
You're not even worth
the cost to incarcerate you.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.523
Which is why you're being deported.

16:24.067 --> 16:27.569
Your plane leaves this afternoon.
And James,

16:27.654 --> 16:30.489
you're banned from
setting foot in Australia again.

16:30.573 --> 16:34.284
Don't you worry.
I ain't ever coming back here.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.078
Best not, mate.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.138
A lumberjack.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.350
'Scuse me?

16:58.434 --> 17:01.478
I never asked what you did
back in the real world.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.815
I'm taking a wild guess. Lumberjack.

17:04.898 --> 17:08.109
Something I can help you with, doc?
'Cause I got work to do.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.154
I got something for you.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.742
You're the only one on the raft
who knows how to use one.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.538
- What do I need a gun for?
- Just in case.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.625
You think we're gonna
run outta food and water?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.544
I put the kid out of his misery?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.045
Just in case.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.174
What're you doing with the rest?

17:31.259 --> 17:33.135
Giving 'em to Sayid.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.972
Going into the jungle
after the boomsticks?

17:38.266 --> 17:39.516
Yeah.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.810
Time you get back,
we'll be in the water.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.771
Guess this is pretty much goodbye then.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.858
Yeah, I guess it is.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.654
Good luck, Sawyer.

17:58.995 --> 17:59.995
Jack.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.838
About a week before
we all got on the plane,

18:11.340 --> 18:14.217
I got to talking to this man
in a bar in Sydney.

18:14.302 --> 18:18.013
He was an American too. A doctor.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.974
I've been on some benders in my time,

18:21.058 --> 18:24.811
but this guy was going
for an all-time record.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.899
So it turns out this guy has a son.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.318
Son's a doctor too.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.781
They'd had some kinda
big-time falling out.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.619
The guy knew it was his fault...
even though his son

18:40.703 --> 18:43.371
was back in the States
thinking the same damn thing.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.462
See, kids are like dogs.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.924
You knock 'em around enough

18:54.008 --> 18:56.885
and they'll think they did
something to deserve it.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.682
Anyway...

19:04.018 --> 19:06.478
...there's a pay phone in this bar

19:06.562 --> 19:08.230
and this guy...

19:10.900 --> 19:12.234
...Christian...

19:14.153 --> 19:16.655
...tells me he wishes he had the stones

19:16.739 --> 19:18.740
to pick up the phone and call his kid.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.661
Tell him he's sorry.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.581
That he's a better doctor
than he'll ever be.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.086
He's proud.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.590
And he loves him.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.267
I had to take off...

19:49.647 --> 19:52.816
...but something tells me
he never made that call.

19:58.406 --> 19:59.739
Small world, huh?

20:03.327 --> 20:04.411
Yeah.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.833
Good luck, Jack.

20:28.895 --> 20:33.231
- You're gonna be armed?
- Yes, sir, an ankle holster.

20:33.316 --> 20:36.067
Stow this in the crew luggage
compartment in front.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.402
No problemo.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.156
Why do you need five guns?

20:42.825 --> 20:44.576
Gee, you wanna tell him, Kate?

20:44.660 --> 20:47.329
Why do I need five guns?

20:49.832 --> 20:51.166
She's shy.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.587
What's this, then?

20:55.713 --> 20:58.006
That's a good story. You wanna tell it?

21:01.928 --> 21:05.764
This belonged to her
childhood sweetheart,

21:05.848 --> 21:09.059
who she got killed a couple of years ago

21:09.143 --> 21:10.352
when she was on the run.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.980
Poor guy. Had a wife. Two-year-old kid.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.107
What was his name?

21:18.819 --> 21:21.571
Somewhere along during
the three years I chased her,

21:21.656 --> 21:25.283
she starts calling me at my house,

21:25.368 --> 21:28.536
and whining on about
her mitigating circumstances.

21:28.621 --> 21:32.958
But what she's really doing...
is taunting me.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.002
So I tell her that I've got

21:36.087 --> 21:39.798
what's-his-name's little toy airplane

21:39.882 --> 21:43.760
in a safe deposit box in New Mexico.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.346
So she somehow figures out which bank,

21:46.430 --> 21:48.139
which safe deposit box.

21:48.224 --> 21:51.977
She seduces some idiot
to rob the damn bank,

21:52.061 --> 21:55.730
then puts a bullet in her new friend
because she's done using him.

21:58.484 --> 22:02.529
But she leaves all the money.
She just takes the plane.

22:04.407 --> 22:07.033
Because that's the one thing
in the whole world

22:07.118 --> 22:09.661
that Kate does care about.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.539
She has no attachments.

22:14.333 --> 22:18.503
And I think she's
telling herself she needs it

22:18.587 --> 22:22.757
to atone for killing her boyfriend,
what's-his-name.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.970
Come on. What was his name?

22:27.054 --> 22:29.556
Tom!
It was Tom, you son of a bitch.

22:34.270 --> 22:37.397
And that is why I need five guns.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.000
You're heading out?

22:59.628 --> 23:00.628
Yeah.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.841
I was thinking
that I might go with you...

23:06.135 --> 23:08.344
...for old time's sake.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.265
I wanna help.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.020
You won't be here
for the raft launching.

23:17.104 --> 23:21.441
Yeah, well, I'm not
very good at goodbyes.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.320
Grab your stuff.

23:34.789 --> 23:37.207
- Thanks, man.
- Keep it safe.

23:37.291 --> 23:40.585
Locke, you have a message?
It's going on the raft.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.797
You know, "Dear Mom,
everything's fine. I'm on the island.

23:43.881 --> 23:47.550
Unless the Black Smoke People
turn up. Love..." Your name here.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.303
When they get rescued,
they can contact your family.

23:50.387 --> 23:53.348
Message in a bottle. That's sweet.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.685
- You're ready?
- Here you go.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.104
OK.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.565
- Don't look at it.
- Got it.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.361
Dude.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.571
Do not look at it.

24:09.865 --> 24:13.201
- Arzt! You want paper?
- I gave at the office.

24:17.039 --> 24:19.916
- Take care.
- Good luck, dude.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.127
- Keep dry, kiddo.
- I will.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.546
- Good luck.
- Same to you.

24:25.506 --> 24:28.716
- See you soon.
- Yes, you will.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.391
- You look after your dad, OK?
- I will.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.475
All right.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.311
Jin.

24:42.064 --> 24:43.481
Good luck.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.374
- Have you seen Sawyer?
- No.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.252
All right, let's go!

25:05.629 --> 25:07.172
Take care, OK?

26:03.312 --> 26:05.021
Where'd you get the scratches?

26:06.774 --> 26:07.815
A bush.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.693
Mean bush.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.572
We've got to keep moving.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.083
Let me ask you something, Arnzt.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.502
- Arzt.
- Arnzt.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.505
Not Arnzt. Arzt. A-R-Z-T.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.508
Sorry, man, name's hard to pronounce.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.636
I know a bunch of ninth graders
who pronounce it just fine.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.846
How about I call you by your first name?

26:38.931 --> 26:40.848
- How about you don't.
- Why not?

26:40.933 --> 26:43.184
I remember it
from the plane's manifest.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.521
- Leslie's a bitching name.
- "Arnzt" is fine.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.686
Le Territoire Foncé.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.772
The Dark Territory.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.987
The Black Rock is not far.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.449
This is where it all began,
when my team got infected,

27:39.533 --> 27:40.950
when Montand lost his arm.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.705
We must move quickly.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.710
You know what? I'm going back.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.296
Hey, I thought you wanted to help.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.589
Yeah, I wanted to help,

27:54.673 --> 27:57.091
before Montand lost his frigging arm.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.218
What about the dynamite?

27:59.887 --> 28:03.139
Just be very careful with it.

28:12.066 --> 28:15.360
No! This one goes there, that one there.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.446
Hey, chief!

28:21.533 --> 28:23.076
Cut and measured to length.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.205
- Perfect mast.
- Thanks.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.291
Well, all right.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.671
Are we gonna get off this rock
or just stand around talking about it?

29:01.949 --> 29:03.533
Did you hear that?

29:19.508 --> 29:21.801
Run! Run!

29:28.475 --> 29:30.059
Run!

29:31.728 --> 29:33.729
- What are you...?
- Just be still.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.662
Here! In here.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.545
Dude, we gotta book.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.797
Wait.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.470
It's headed the other way.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.277
We're safe now.

30:22.821 --> 30:26.115
- What was that thing?
- It's a security system.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.452
Security system?
What does that mean?

30:29.536 --> 30:32.371
Its purpose is that
of any security system's:

30:32.456 --> 30:34.248
To protect something.

30:34.333 --> 30:38.419
- Protect what?
- The island.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.770
- Where's Arnzt?
- It's Arzt, you idiot.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.356
Dude, I thought you were dead.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.858
Can we just please go get the dynamite?

31:14.289 --> 31:16.457
Why are you folding clothes?

31:17.501 --> 31:19.085
Because I'm anal.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.008
Is there something you want?

31:27.970 --> 31:29.804
I think you should take Vincent.

31:34.476 --> 31:35.560
Are you serious?

31:36.645 --> 31:38.104
He'll take care of you.

31:45.487 --> 31:48.197
What makes you think I need
a dog to take care of me?

31:49.324 --> 31:51.867
Vincent took care of me
when my mom died.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.039
And nobody would talk to me.

31:57.124 --> 32:00.167
They pretended like nothing happened.

32:00.252 --> 32:03.129
So I talked to Vincent.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.380
He's a good listener.

32:06.300 --> 32:09.385
You could talk to him
about Boone if you want.

32:19.313 --> 32:20.896
All right.

32:23.692 --> 32:26.110
But only until you get us rescued, OK?

32:42.127 --> 32:43.961
Flight 338 to Fiji will be delayed.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.631
Please check the board
for flight details.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.594
Excuse me, would you mind
watching my bag for a moment?

32:51.678 --> 32:52.887
I'll be right back.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.432
- Sure. Whatever.
- Thank you.

32:58.894 --> 33:01.646
Couldn't get us into first class.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.230
Why not?

33:03.315 --> 33:05.775
You shouldn't have yelled
at the gate agent.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.069
What, you're on his side now?

33:08.153 --> 33:10.446
One day you'll appreciate
all I do for you.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.907
Yeah, I can't wait for that day.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.828
- Try again with the gate agent.
- Would you let it go?

33:17.913 --> 33:20.039
Excuse me for not being
pathetic enough

33:20.123 --> 33:23.084
to want to sit next to a crying baby
for the next 15 hours.

33:23.168 --> 33:27.129
- Oh, God, you can be a bitch.
- Oh, you wanna play?

33:27.214 --> 33:30.049
- I'll get you thrown off this flight.
- How?

33:30.133 --> 33:32.134
I can do what I want.
I can tell them...

33:32.219 --> 33:35.179
Tell them what?
Who's gonna believe you?

33:35.263 --> 33:39.266
- You're not even capable of...
- You have no idea what I am capable of.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.977
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:42.062 --> 33:46.107
Some Arab guy left his bags in the
chairs downstairs and walked away.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.608
Can you describe him?

33:48.944 --> 33:50.319
Arab.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.947
He went towards the shops.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.036
How's that?

34:04.376 --> 34:07.628
I salvaged a few things for you
from the Beechcraft.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.547
This is the plane's radar emitter.

34:09.630 --> 34:12.842
It needs to be mounted
on the mast or at the top of the cabin.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.260
I'll do it.

34:15.804 --> 34:19.556
To conserve power, turn it on
only once every hour or so.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.101
It shows you any ships
within the horizon line,

34:22.185 --> 34:26.813
approximately 25 miles.
The same with the radio transmitter.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.317
This was in the plane's toolbox.
There's only one flare.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.904
Choose wisely when you use it.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.839
- Why are we stopping?
- Because we're here.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.635
This is the Black Rock.

35:16.907 --> 35:20.951
This is pre-boarding
for flight 2599...

35:40.931 --> 35:43.808
You catch me doing anything
like that for you, shoot me.

35:43.892 --> 35:47.937
Don't knock it. Their divorce rate's
20 times lower than ours.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.998
It's Memoirs of a Geisha
come to life.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.166
Hey, volume.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.128
Relax. They don't speak English.

36:47.873 --> 36:51.709
Star... Starboard.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.336
Starboard.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.461
Go, go!

40:23.838 --> 40:24.880
Bye, Vincent.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.009
That's it.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.367
Stay, Vincent.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.834
Go back.

41:37.871 --> 41:39.454
What'd I tell ya?

41:43.084 --> 41:44.334
We did it.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.837
You!
