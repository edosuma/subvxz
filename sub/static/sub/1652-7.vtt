WEBVTT

00:01.399 --> 00:04.399
Justin, what happened?

00:05.434 --> 00:08.504
Justin, look at me. What happened?

00:10.039 --> 00:12.941
It was... it was something stupid.

00:12.975 --> 00:16.177
I just got into a fight outside
of McIntyre's with this...

00:16.212 --> 00:20.381
I broke this guy's nose, I think. Right?

00:20.415 --> 00:22.450
- What'd you hit him with?
- What?

00:22.484 --> 00:24.518
Your knuckles aren't bruised or...

00:24.553 --> 00:29.022
I just... I cracked him with...
I got him with an elbow real good.

00:29.057 --> 00:33.894
Justin, what's going on?

00:33.928 --> 00:36.997
Hey, listen, I shouldn't have come here.

00:37.031 --> 00:38.732
- It was a mistake.
- No, come on.

00:38.767 --> 00:40.033
It's just like I said. I'm sorry.

00:40.068 --> 00:41.201
I shouldn't have brought
you in on this, okay?

00:41.236 --> 00:42.202
I don't even know what I was thinking.

00:42.237 --> 00:44.304
Justin!

00:44.338 --> 00:46.339
Ju...

00:59.487 --> 01:00.820
I run past here every morning,

01:00.854 --> 01:02.054
and this time, Sammy was going nuts.

01:02.089 --> 01:04.456
Stay right there, sir.

01:09.263 --> 01:10.930
I'll call it in.

01:14.001 --> 01:16.702
I'll be back in a minute, all right?

01:16.736 --> 01:17.736
All right, take care.

01:27.013 --> 01:28.880
Look, we do this in your office

01:28.915 --> 01:30.882
or by the back door from now on.

01:30.917 --> 01:35.754
We do it where I say we do it. Have a seat.

01:38.792 --> 01:42.760
There was a body found this morning.

01:42.795 --> 01:44.696
Homicide thinks it involves
someone you might know.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.331
Who is it?

01:50.203 --> 01:52.570
Frank Fitori.

01:52.604 --> 01:54.840
Ran a B&E ring on the south side.

01:54.874 --> 01:57.709
Also a longtime rival...

01:57.743 --> 02:01.679
of this guy.

02:01.714 --> 02:06.083
Alessio Colo.

02:06.297 --> 02:10.267
Also in the picture are
some of his associates,

02:10.300 --> 02:12.503
including..

02:12.538 --> 02:15.339
This man, Joe Catalano,

02:15.373 --> 02:18.542
who recently got out of prison.

02:18.576 --> 02:21.578
- If you're asking me to get...
- I'm not asking.

02:21.612 --> 02:24.581
Look, I got you reinstated,

02:24.615 --> 02:26.550
but you have been moving like a glacier

02:26.584 --> 02:28.352
since we set up this deal with you,

02:28.386 --> 02:31.087
and it's time for results, Hank.

02:31.121 --> 02:33.990
Fine.

02:34.025 --> 02:36.026
I'll get back to you.

02:43.534 --> 02:46.269
There he is. Hey.

02:46.303 --> 02:48.171
Want me to cut you some pastrami, Hank?

02:48.205 --> 02:49.305
I got a half pound from Vecchio's.

02:49.339 --> 02:50.258
No, no, no, I'm good.

02:52.042 --> 02:54.210
Listen, you know, when Justin
got sent up to Stateville,

02:54.244 --> 02:56.512
I went out of my mind.

02:56.546 --> 02:58.481
The son of a cop in that hellhole?

02:58.515 --> 03:00.483
I couldn't imagine.

03:00.517 --> 03:02.051
I remember.

03:02.086 --> 03:03.586
Well, you stepped up.

03:03.620 --> 03:06.689
I mean, reached out to
your nephew Joe Catalano,

03:06.723 --> 03:10.893
and he shielded Justin from the
worst of it while he was there.

03:10.927 --> 03:14.663
What that means to me, you have no idea.

03:14.698 --> 03:16.732
It was just a friend helping a friend.

03:16.766 --> 03:17.900
Yeah, well, Justin's out now.

03:17.934 --> 03:20.469
He's on the mend.

03:20.503 --> 03:22.837
I can never repay that debt.

03:22.872 --> 03:26.141
So, you know, I mean, I'll look
the other way whenever I can.

03:26.175 --> 03:28.276
You don't have to say anything.

03:28.311 --> 03:31.013
Now is not one of those times.

03:33.782 --> 03:35.950
Frank Fitori, your old rival

03:35.985 --> 03:37.752
and the guy who sent up Catalano,

03:37.786 --> 03:39.120
was dumped last night.

03:40.455 --> 03:43.825
I got a pretty good idea who did it.

03:43.859 --> 03:47.695
I need to know where
your nephew is right now.

03:47.730 --> 03:51.833
Alessio, your own survival

03:51.867 --> 03:54.868
depends on how you choose to answer.

04:07.182 --> 04:09.449
You messed up, Catalano.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.784
Get off of me.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.853
Had your way with Frank
Fitori last night, didn't you?

04:12.887 --> 04:14.254
A little payback.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.889
Who's Frank Fitori?

04:15.924 --> 04:17.524
He testified, sent you up.

04:17.559 --> 04:19.125
Motive's strong.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.363
Resisting?

04:23.397 --> 04:24.631
That how you want to play this?

04:24.666 --> 04:26.599
Come on.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.335
Okay, maybe you're right, Voight.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.636
Maybe I smoked him.

04:30.671 --> 04:35.308
Maybe I spent the last six
years thinking about it.

04:35.342 --> 04:39.079
But why don't we talk about the
part where Justin was involved?

04:39.813 --> 04:41.847
What'd you say?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.950
Your son Justin.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.885
Maybe he didn't have a chance to tell you.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.921
I mean, Justin's my boy.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.390
So why don't we go down to the station,

04:51.424 --> 04:52.925
or whatever you want to call it,

04:52.960 --> 04:54.560
so that I can tell everyone that Justin

04:54.595 --> 04:58.330
was there when Fitori got his stack smoked?

04:59.765 --> 05:03.602
You change your mind?

05:03.636 --> 05:05.704
'Cause I don't know how well

05:05.738 --> 05:09.308
Justin's gonna do his next time in lockup,

05:09.342 --> 05:14.079
given that he was such a little
bitch his first time around.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.560
No? Wha...

05:29.595 --> 05:31.496
that's what I thought.

05:32.547 --> 05:36.613
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:39.632 --> 05:41.298
H-i-j-o. Hijo.

05:41.332 --> 05:43.930
No, not like "son,"
you. Like sun in the sky.

05:43.974 --> 05:46.275
Oh. S-o-l. Sol.

05:46.309 --> 05:48.277
That's what I'm talking about.

05:48.311 --> 05:49.846
See, his Spanish is
already better than yours.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.148
Oh, hey. Be careful today, hon. Okay?

05:52.182 --> 05:54.017
Always, baby. Love you guys.

05:54.051 --> 05:57.419
See you, dad.

06:01.758 --> 06:04.393
Hey, bro.

06:04.427 --> 06:07.363
How's he doing?

06:07.397 --> 06:09.064
A nightmare every now and then.

06:09.098 --> 06:11.033
Otherwise, great.

06:11.067 --> 06:13.335
I think Laura and I probably
think of it more than he does.

06:13.370 --> 06:16.138
Well, kids are resilient.

06:16.173 --> 06:19.407
You're a lucky man. Enjoy it.

06:24.246 --> 06:26.848
Hey, Olinsky, department's pushing back

06:26.883 --> 06:28.349
on these expense reports you turned in.

06:28.384 --> 06:30.919
27 bucks for Powerade? Not covered.

06:30.953 --> 06:32.721
- You owe me 27 bucks.
- No, no, no.

06:32.755 --> 06:34.689
Nobody told me that we got to
go out of pocket on stakeouts.

06:34.723 --> 06:36.658
Is that so? Oh, great.

06:36.692 --> 06:39.060
Order some caviar and
lobster tails next time, then.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.094
What's all this?

06:40.128 --> 06:41.596
New photo I.D. cards in the district.

06:41.630 --> 06:44.399
There's no way you're
getting my face on a badge.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.167
Well, the locks aren't gonna work

06:46.202 --> 06:47.435
without the new I.D., Alvin.

06:47.469 --> 06:49.370
Okay, here, get your camera ready.

06:49.405 --> 06:50.405
You got it?

06:50.439 --> 06:54.308
Hey, Turner and Hooch, get over here.

06:54.342 --> 06:56.476
I better be Turner.

06:56.511 --> 06:58.445
- What is it?
- Need a photo.

06:58.479 --> 07:00.581
Because we found a body.

07:00.615 --> 07:02.083
If this is for The Tribune,
my mama might want a couple...

07:02.117 --> 07:04.351
For your new I.D. badge, Einstein.

07:04.385 --> 07:05.920
- Oh.
- Step on the "X."

07:05.954 --> 07:10.624
Okay. Hold that.

07:10.658 --> 07:11.725
Okay, on the count of three.

07:11.759 --> 07:13.126
Okay.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.528
One...

07:14.562 --> 07:15.762
Are you serious?

07:15.796 --> 07:17.931
- I wasn't ready.
- Well, no worries. I got it.

07:17.965 --> 07:19.266
No, let me see it.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.701
No, no, no. No, we're good.

07:20.735 --> 07:22.102
Burgess, you gonna put some makeup on?

07:22.136 --> 07:24.470
I already put makeup on.

07:24.504 --> 07:26.706
Oh. Well, stand over there. You're next.

07:26.741 --> 07:28.041
You know what, Sergeant,

07:28.075 --> 07:30.977
I actually need to borrow her for a second.

07:31.011 --> 07:32.411
I have your expense reports.

07:32.446 --> 07:34.247
Come here. Burgess, come here.

07:34.281 --> 07:37.851
Come here.

07:37.885 --> 07:39.652
- Hey, Platt, come on.
- No, no.

07:39.686 --> 07:42.988
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Come on...

07:43.022 --> 07:44.323
I don't actually need you for anything.

07:44.358 --> 07:45.958
I just thought you could use the out.

07:47.193 --> 07:49.161
Thank you.

07:49.195 --> 07:52.298
Yeah. I like messing with her.

07:52.332 --> 07:54.166
See you later.

07:57.703 --> 08:00.172
Hey, anybody seen Voight?

08:00.206 --> 08:02.407
What is it?

08:02.441 --> 08:05.110
We got a problem.

08:05.145 --> 08:06.779
Justin showed up at my
apartment last night,

08:06.813 --> 08:08.113
blood on his hands.

08:08.148 --> 08:12.417
He said he got in a bar
fight, but I don't know.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.451
Where is he now?

08:13.486 --> 08:16.454
He took off.

08:21.694 --> 08:24.862
Justin...

08:24.897 --> 08:28.667
give me a call when you get this.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.138
All right, we got a new case.

08:34.173 --> 08:36.340
This is Frank Fitori,

08:36.374 --> 08:39.143
caught napping in a ditch by
the marsh where he was dumped.

08:39.178 --> 08:41.813
He's had his own little racket
on the south side for years.

08:41.847 --> 08:43.380
He swims with a lot of big fish.

08:43.414 --> 08:44.782
Swam.

08:44.817 --> 08:47.384
- Swam.
- Well...

08:47.419 --> 08:49.853
All right, Halstead and I
will check out the murder site.

08:49.887 --> 08:52.055
Great idea. Why don't you and Jay do that?

08:52.089 --> 08:54.725
Everyone else, go through
the confidential files

08:54.759 --> 08:58.529
on Taylor Street, Bridgeport,
Chinatown, and Melrose crews.

08:58.563 --> 09:01.998
Let's see who's running what nowadays.

09:02.033 --> 09:04.034
Did you see the look on his face?

09:04.068 --> 09:06.236
Yeah. So?

09:06.270 --> 09:08.671
- So?
- We haven't done anything.

09:08.706 --> 09:10.140
Don't I know it.

09:10.174 --> 09:13.076
Would you spit out whatever
you're trying to spit out?

09:13.110 --> 09:14.711
Okay.

09:14.745 --> 09:17.747
Maybe this last month I
don't like being the guy

09:17.781 --> 09:19.682
you use to get a rise
out of your father figure.

09:19.717 --> 09:22.685
- You wish I was using you.
- Oh, I'm serious.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.686
You have issues. You need to work them out.

09:23.721 --> 09:24.854
Work them out without me.

09:24.888 --> 09:26.856
I repeat, we haven't done anything.

09:26.890 --> 09:27.857
And if you want to keep it that way...

09:27.891 --> 09:29.024
hey, that'd be great.

09:29.059 --> 09:30.727
- All right, perfect.
- Fantastic.

09:30.761 --> 09:31.961
You done?

09:31.995 --> 09:34.063
I was done long before
this conversation started.

09:34.097 --> 09:37.099
Really? Then shut up.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.508
Where is the dead guy?

09:46.542 --> 09:48.510
Homicide already came and went.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.479
Then the crime lab. Then the mort patrol.

09:50.513 --> 09:52.647
Thanks.

10:00.390 --> 10:03.024
Is that one of our pods?

10:03.058 --> 10:05.861
Dinner at the Purple
Pig? It's got the dump.

10:05.895 --> 10:07.962
- Those things suck.
- I don't think so.

10:07.997 --> 10:09.898
Besides, you just told me to
shut up and that we're done.

10:09.932 --> 10:13.334
No, you told me we were
done, but a girl's got to eat.

10:13.369 --> 10:15.703
Now you're hungry.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.251
- Hey, I've been thinking...
- Hey, can this wait?

10:18.285 --> 10:19.685
- I got to meet someone.
- Wait, wait.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.254
Fitori, the D.O.A.,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.522
he's had a big mouth over
the years, a lot of enemies.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.558
Yeah, I know.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.159
And he wasn't afraid to turn
state's to save his own ass,

10:27.193 --> 10:29.728
- more than once.
- Look, Antonio, I got to go.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.564
Okay, but listen, I've been
looking at a lot of the guys

10:31.598 --> 10:33.298
that his testifying has helped send up.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.907
Between us, a few of those
guys have been known to frequent

10:41.942 --> 10:43.708
a lot of the same places that you do.

10:43.742 --> 10:45.510
I was just wondering if
you'd thought about that,

10:45.544 --> 10:46.845
or done any thinking on it.

10:46.879 --> 10:49.247
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of angles to cover here.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.748
Right, right, but I was
thinking in particular

10:50.783 --> 10:52.550
about the social club you belong to.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.885
It's not all stand-up citizens in there.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.653
I mean, it's common knowledge.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.622
What are you trying to say, bro?

10:57.656 --> 10:59.958
I'm not trying to bust your balls here.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.893
It's just, if Fitori's history is crossed

11:01.927 --> 11:03.427
with a guy at your place,

11:03.462 --> 11:04.729
I might need your cooperation.

11:04.763 --> 11:06.731
Might be able to make a
move on them from the inside.

11:06.765 --> 11:08.700
It's a good thought, but I already had Jin

11:08.734 --> 11:10.535
cross all the cases you're talking about,

11:10.569 --> 11:12.403
where Fitori talked.

11:12.437 --> 11:14.739
No names popped up.

11:14.773 --> 11:16.540
Really? But I just talked to Jin.

11:16.574 --> 11:19.776
He didn't mention that.

11:22.514 --> 11:25.849
Jin does a lot for me he doesn't mention.

11:27.452 --> 11:28.919
Is there any confusion on your part

11:28.953 --> 11:30.954
on who runs Intelligence?

11:32.256 --> 11:34.791
Just trying to solve the case.

11:48.670 --> 11:50.569
Hey, man, you know where Justin Voight is?

11:50.603 --> 11:51.637
Who's asking?

11:51.672 --> 11:53.806
His father. I need to talk to him.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.408
Well, so do I, so I
can tell him he's fired.

11:56.442 --> 12:00.412
He hasn't showed up for
three straight shifts.

12:00.446 --> 12:03.282
Thanks.

12:20.900 --> 12:24.268
Come on, Sarge. Let's just talk hookups.

12:24.303 --> 12:26.304
- Can we talk hookups?
- You looked great.

12:26.338 --> 12:30.178
Your I.D. will be the pride of District 21.

12:30.182 --> 12:31.883
You can make copies, give
those to your grandma.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.918
I just need one more. I'm begging you.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.486
Sarge, if I have to walk
around with a Deputy Dawg photo

12:35.521 --> 12:37.421
for the rest of this year, I'm
never gonna hear the end of it.

12:37.456 --> 12:38.856
Where the hell is your partner?

12:38.890 --> 12:41.825
I got to turn these photo files in.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.227
I have no idea.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.829
I think Intelligence needed her
to run something up to the lab.

12:49.201 --> 12:52.202
- What?
- Nothing.

12:52.236 --> 12:55.172
So I'm thinking we stop into
some pawn shops on Blue Island.

12:55.206 --> 12:58.275
I'll bet you anything the
murder weapon found on Fitori,

12:58.309 --> 13:01.745
dump gun, bought as an
afterthought just before.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.747
Al.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.050
Alvin, you're not listening to me.

13:06.084 --> 13:07.950
Well, you talk so much, it's hard to know

13:07.985 --> 13:10.787
when I'm supposed to listen
and when I can just tune out.

13:10.821 --> 13:14.391
Sheesh. You're miserable.

13:14.425 --> 13:16.526
No kidding, kid.

13:16.561 --> 13:17.527
But you'll learn.

13:17.562 --> 13:18.961
I'm not you, old man.

13:18.996 --> 13:20.263
You can keep your misery.

13:20.298 --> 13:21.464
I'm all sunshine and roses over here.

13:21.499 --> 13:23.567
Peachy keen, Mr. Bean.

13:23.601 --> 13:26.468
All right, what were you saying?

13:26.503 --> 13:28.971
That I'll bet that the
murder weapon is a dump gun.

13:29.006 --> 13:31.240
Well, let's hit the pawn shops.

13:31.274 --> 13:34.276
Come on.

13:38.648 --> 13:39.615
There.

13:39.649 --> 13:42.284
- Surf and turf.
- It sucks.

13:42.319 --> 13:43.719
Like I said, you can't see anything.

13:43.753 --> 13:45.954
Can you make this brighter?

13:45.988 --> 13:47.223
- No.
- Come on.

13:47.257 --> 13:48.724
- Dinner depends on this.
- What do you want from me?

13:48.758 --> 13:50.158
I can't make it daytime.

13:50.193 --> 13:51.960
I told you, the image on the
file is the image on the file.

13:51.994 --> 13:52.961
Fine.

13:52.995 --> 13:56.398
Hey, what is that?

13:56.433 --> 13:58.967
Kane Builders?

13:59.001 --> 14:00.836
If they have a private
security cam at the lot,

14:00.870 --> 14:02.704
I bet you we get at least
a plate off the Escalade.

14:02.739 --> 14:04.572
- Genius.
- I am. Thank you.

14:04.607 --> 14:06.407
And let's roll the bet onto that camera,

14:06.442 --> 14:10.846
'cause that's where the answer is.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.147
It would help us out if you let us

14:12.181 --> 14:13.481
see any footage your security cams caught.

14:13.515 --> 14:16.384
I mean, we could come back
and get a warrant, but...

14:16.418 --> 14:17.619
I'd be more than happy to, sincerely.

14:17.653 --> 14:21.055
But I don't even know if we keep them on.

14:21.089 --> 14:23.424
Tell you what, it's all run

14:23.459 --> 14:25.192
by some company in India or something.

14:25.227 --> 14:27.795
Here's the number of our office downtown.

14:27.829 --> 14:29.364
Ask for Libby.

14:29.398 --> 14:31.232
Tell her don told you
to give you the number,

14:31.266 --> 14:32.366
and she'll take care of you.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.367
Great. Thank you.

14:33.401 --> 14:35.069
I'll call the Purple Pig.

14:35.103 --> 14:37.671
Seeing as how you're buying,
it's the least I can do.

14:37.705 --> 14:40.374
And just so you know,
I'm thinking truffles.

14:40.408 --> 14:43.010
Right.

14:43.044 --> 14:46.980
Okay, I'm just gonna move
you a little, just this way.

14:47.014 --> 14:49.316
And then if you could just
put... okay, is that good for you?

14:49.350 --> 14:52.218
'Cause in this light, your eyes
are, like, really sparkling.

14:52.253 --> 14:53.853
Yeah, it's fine.

14:53.888 --> 14:55.756
Okay, then let's get it on film,

14:55.790 --> 14:57.791
or whatever they call it nowadays.

14:57.825 --> 15:01.828
Okay, in one, two, three.

15:01.862 --> 15:04.898
Oh, wow. That's perfect. Wow.

15:04.932 --> 15:06.132
You want to see it?

15:06.167 --> 15:07.233
I'm good, thanks.

15:07.268 --> 15:09.035
Okay.

15:09.069 --> 15:10.904
Hooch, about time.

15:10.938 --> 15:12.071
Where do you want me?

15:12.106 --> 15:14.740
The "X."

15:14.775 --> 15:15.741
This good?

15:15.776 --> 15:20.413
In one, two, three.

15:25.552 --> 15:26.519
Are we done?

15:26.553 --> 15:28.387
Oh, no.

15:28.422 --> 15:30.756
No, no, no. Wait. I think I blinked.

15:30.791 --> 15:32.090
Nope. Perfect.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.992
One more, please.

15:34.027 --> 15:36.962
I got a lot to do today,
Burgess, so skedaddle, huh?

15:38.464 --> 15:39.832
Do you remember that time that I helped you

15:39.866 --> 15:41.066
raise donations for your charity?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.702
Funny thing about time,
it just keeps going.

15:43.736 --> 15:46.972
That calendar rolled over.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.344
Come in, Hank.

15:52.378 --> 15:55.079
Just wanted to get you up to speed.

15:55.113 --> 15:57.949
I looked into Alessio Colo like you asked.

15:59.051 --> 16:01.453
Or Intelligence did, I should say.

16:01.487 --> 16:04.055
My gut tells me he had nothing
to do with the Fitori murder.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.857
Your gut.

16:05.891 --> 16:08.159
This Fitori, the D.O.A.?

16:08.193 --> 16:09.460
I did some asking around.

16:09.494 --> 16:11.128
Seems he skipped on into narcotics.

16:11.163 --> 16:13.297
My man in the gang unit tells me

16:13.332 --> 16:16.200
he's been chumming around with
the Mickey Cobras, that's...

16:16.235 --> 16:18.635
that's an aggressive outfit.

16:20.305 --> 16:23.741
Yeah, probably didn't work out, you know.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.645
Anyway, it ain't Colo.

16:28.680 --> 16:32.683
So we're turning the
files over to homicide.

16:32.717 --> 16:33.884
Okay?

16:33.918 --> 16:37.488
Sure, Hank.

16:54.205 --> 16:57.207
Thank you for coming so
quickly, Detective Dawson.

16:57.241 --> 16:59.575
I know you're busy.

16:59.610 --> 17:01.377
Yeah, well, meeting I.A.
in some secret spot...

17:01.412 --> 17:02.578
Relax.

17:02.613 --> 17:04.946
Everyone knows you're a great detective.

17:04.981 --> 17:07.750
I talked to Brady in Vice after
we chatted a few weeks ago,

17:07.785 --> 17:08.983
and he wore my ear out for an hour

17:09.019 --> 17:10.152
telling me what a straight arrow you are.

17:10.185 --> 17:12.655
Come on.

17:12.689 --> 17:15.824
Fine.

17:15.858 --> 17:18.928
We have had Sergeant Voight working for us

17:18.962 --> 17:20.595
since he got pulled out of lockup,

17:20.630 --> 17:23.065
a stipulation to his release.

17:23.098 --> 17:26.402
He pretends to be dirty, helps
us run down some heavy hitters.

17:26.435 --> 17:27.536
It's a win-win for everybody.

17:27.569 --> 17:30.539
Only he wasn't just playing dirty.

17:30.573 --> 17:31.673
He was dirty.

17:31.707 --> 17:33.374
He still is.

17:33.409 --> 17:35.176
We were the suckers.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.011
Or, more specifically, I was the sucker.

17:37.046 --> 17:39.180
Hey, lie down with dogs...

17:39.214 --> 17:41.450
You have the same fleas crawling on you

17:41.484 --> 17:43.518
that I do, Detective, your whole unit.

17:43.553 --> 17:46.955
Did you know Erin Lindsay
is a former informant

17:46.989 --> 17:48.756
Voight turned out at 14?

17:48.790 --> 17:50.791
You think she's not carrying water for him?

17:50.826 --> 17:54.162
He is building an army there,

17:54.196 --> 17:57.365
and it is only a matter
of time before it implodes.

17:57.399 --> 17:59.700
The murder at the Marsh,

17:59.734 --> 18:02.337
I told Voight to look into Alessio Colo.

18:02.371 --> 18:03.871
He told me he would.

18:03.905 --> 18:07.140
Then he blew it off.

18:07.175 --> 18:10.444
I wonder why.

18:21.409 --> 18:23.143
He never mentioned Colo as a suspect.

18:23.177 --> 18:25.445
There you go.

18:25.479 --> 18:30.250
To be very clear, detective,
I am going to take Voight down.

18:30.285 --> 18:32.319
Everyone's watching how this plays out.

18:32.353 --> 18:33.820
Right now, it's either me or him.

18:33.854 --> 18:36.290
Once he's gone,

18:36.324 --> 18:38.324
you are in the perfect position

18:38.358 --> 18:40.960
to get a promotion and
take over Intelligence.

18:40.994 --> 18:45.665
All you got to do is choose a side.

18:54.421 --> 18:56.055
All right.

18:56.089 --> 18:57.957
This turned out to be
more of a homicide thing,

18:57.991 --> 18:59.291
as we all suspected.

18:59.325 --> 19:00.559
I apologize.

19:00.593 --> 19:02.594
Hold up a sec.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.067
Alessio Colo.

19:09.101 --> 19:11.035
He was one of the top
bosses on the south side.

19:11.070 --> 19:14.573
Bookmaking, loan-sharking,
extortion, armed robberies.

19:14.607 --> 19:16.107
C.P.D. thought he was retired,

19:16.142 --> 19:18.209
but now a tip leads us to
believe he's back in the game.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.443
What are you doing?

19:19.478 --> 19:23.081
And this is Joe Catalano,

19:23.115 --> 19:24.883
habitual felon just released

19:24.917 --> 19:27.118
from Stateville, and Colo's nephew.

19:27.153 --> 19:30.755
He used to work for Colo
back before he got sent up.

19:30.790 --> 19:32.823
Our D.O.A., Fitori...

19:32.857 --> 19:36.160
He turned rat on Catalano back in '06.

19:36.194 --> 19:37.828
He made a deal with the state's attorney

19:37.862 --> 19:40.464
that kept him in jail and put Catalano in.

19:40.589 --> 19:42.222
Well, it sounds like Catalano got released.

19:42.257 --> 19:43.824
He got right to it.

19:43.859 --> 19:46.260
All right, so if this is Catalano...

19:46.294 --> 19:49.096
Who is the driver?

19:50.744 --> 19:53.180
Okay, I'm tracking down the Indian company

19:53.214 --> 19:55.782
that has footage from
the construction yard.

19:55.816 --> 19:57.684
Just waiting for the
sun to come up over there

19:57.718 --> 20:00.853
and we should have a
clear shot of the driver.

20:07.527 --> 20:11.830
Yeah, the D.O.A., Frank Fitori,

20:11.864 --> 20:15.267
he used to run with this
Ross crew back in the day.

20:15.302 --> 20:20.272
A guy named Dean-O Ross was the patriarch.

20:20.307 --> 20:22.341
Along with Fitori,

20:22.375 --> 20:24.310
Dean Ross was on the
grand jury witness list.

20:24.344 --> 20:27.479
- This him?
- Yep, Dean-O, yeah.

20:27.513 --> 20:29.514
Maybe Dean-O's a target too, huh?

20:29.548 --> 20:31.049
All right, let's go.

20:31.084 --> 20:33.118
Ruzek and I will shadow
him, tuck him in at night.

20:33.152 --> 20:35.186
That's a good idea.

20:35.221 --> 20:39.124
Lindsay and I will come too.

20:39.158 --> 20:42.494
Eh, looks like we're all going.

20:42.528 --> 20:47.232
I'd like to talk to you in my office first.

21:05.717 --> 21:07.151
I was told...

21:07.185 --> 21:08.552
No...

21:08.586 --> 21:13.090
I was instructed to run
this investigation, Sergeant.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.691
If you want to take it upstairs

21:14.725 --> 21:18.662
and explain why you'd
rather I didn't, be my guest.

21:18.696 --> 21:21.064
It sounds like you know what you're doing.

21:21.168 --> 21:23.337
I'm confident I do.

21:23.371 --> 21:26.406
Then let's see where this leads.

21:50.944 --> 21:52.812
What is it?

21:52.846 --> 21:54.580
Justin was there.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.048
Where?

21:56.082 --> 21:59.819
He was the driver. Catalano told me.

21:59.853 --> 22:03.322
And when this other footage comes in...

22:03.517 --> 22:06.084
I stopped by the C.T.A.

22:06.119 --> 22:09.554
His supervisor told me he
hadn't been there in weeks.

22:09.588 --> 22:12.657
He's slipping away on me.

22:12.691 --> 22:15.793
All right, don't bite
my head off for asking...

22:15.828 --> 22:17.162
Just ask.

22:17.196 --> 22:21.633
Are you gonna bury the case?

22:21.667 --> 22:24.468
I don't think Antonio's
going to let that happen.

22:29.107 --> 22:32.143
O, you got eyes on him?

22:32.177 --> 22:35.346
Just approaching now. We got him.

22:35.380 --> 22:38.215
We're near Clark and belmont,
in case he heads to the highway.

22:48.626 --> 22:50.694
Ross is on foot,

22:50.728 --> 22:52.696
heading toward the
tanning salon on Sheffield.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.998
Be right there.

22:58.235 --> 23:00.136
The salon's been a money-laundering front

23:00.171 --> 23:01.504
for a long time.

23:01.539 --> 23:03.173
Wouldn't Catalano know that?

23:03.207 --> 23:04.841
Yep.

23:15.352 --> 23:18.854
- Whoa, whoa. Catalano.
- I got him.

23:18.889 --> 23:21.958
Catalano!

23:21.992 --> 23:23.393
Stop!

23:23.427 --> 23:25.395
Wait!

23:25.429 --> 23:27.029
Suspect is heading south.

23:41.778 --> 23:44.012
Go! Go!

23:44.046 --> 23:45.481
Go!

23:54.124 --> 23:56.658
I lost him.

24:01.497 --> 24:03.264
I lost him.

24:27.413 --> 24:28.681
I want to know what's going on.

24:28.715 --> 24:30.949
- You tell me.
- Now, Voight.

24:30.984 --> 24:32.951
Don't come in here barking at me,

24:32.986 --> 24:34.519
or you're gonna see me off the leash.

24:34.554 --> 24:37.989
Oh, you're pretty far off the leash.

24:38.023 --> 24:39.591
Have been since I got here.

24:39.625 --> 24:42.093
You want to work your own
system, that's your play...

24:42.127 --> 24:44.762
until it affects us.

24:44.797 --> 24:46.364
Now, this unit's gonna take down

24:46.399 --> 24:48.132
anyone involved in Fitori's death.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.302
And if you get in the way,

24:50.336 --> 24:53.571
then I'm going to see to
it that you go down too.

24:53.605 --> 24:55.740
How's Diego?

24:55.774 --> 24:57.942
What?

24:57.976 --> 24:59.677
Your son.

24:59.712 --> 25:00.878
You know?

25:00.913 --> 25:02.513
The one I busted my ass

25:02.547 --> 25:04.481
to get safe when he was kidnapped.

25:04.516 --> 25:06.818
Go to hell.

25:06.852 --> 25:09.486
When you needed this
unit, it rallied around...

25:09.521 --> 25:12.656
I rallied around you!

25:12.691 --> 25:14.658
You want to talk, I'll be at my desk.

25:20.332 --> 25:22.566
What?

25:22.601 --> 25:26.336
Jin's got the construction-site
video from India.

25:26.370 --> 25:29.206
It's downloading in his office.

25:37.681 --> 25:39.415
Burgess, hey.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.651
Atwater. Come here for a quick second.

25:41.685 --> 25:42.652
Yeah?

25:42.686 --> 25:45.421
I tracked something down for you.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.290
That might be the phone
number to the parents

25:47.324 --> 25:49.759
of a certain desk sergeant
that's been giving you grief.

25:49.793 --> 25:51.661
You look into that,

25:51.695 --> 25:53.763
I will deny any involvement, all right?

25:53.797 --> 25:55.831
Who are you? I don't know you.

25:55.866 --> 25:58.033
See? That's right.

26:03.073 --> 26:05.340
I've asked them to increase
the bandwidth down here,

26:05.375 --> 26:07.676
'cause the connection just... oh, wait.

26:07.710 --> 26:09.378
All right, here we go.

26:09.412 --> 26:11.981
Now we'll see who was
with Catalano that night.

26:12.015 --> 26:14.015
- Thanks, Jin.
- Yeah.

26:16.486 --> 26:20.255
We'll call you if we need you.

26:23.092 --> 26:25.494
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

26:25.528 --> 26:27.696
Um, take all the time you need.

26:45.948 --> 26:47.548
It's Justin.

26:54.423 --> 26:55.589
That's it, then.

26:55.624 --> 26:57.358
No, that's not it.

26:57.392 --> 26:59.927
Yeah, well, the kid's
an accomplice to murder.

26:59.961 --> 27:01.094
No, this isn't over yet.

27:01.129 --> 27:03.030
I know he's not answering your calls,

27:03.064 --> 27:06.133
but he's gonna answer mine.

27:24.051 --> 27:25.818
- Hey, O.
- Hey.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.086
What's up?

27:27.120 --> 27:28.955
You and Voight go all the way back.

27:28.989 --> 27:30.022
That's right.

27:30.057 --> 27:31.623
And I know you're thick as thieves.

27:31.658 --> 27:33.659
Well, I might've used a different analogy,

27:33.693 --> 27:35.728
but, you know...

27:35.762 --> 27:39.698
You're good police, the
best U.C. I've ever seen.

27:39.733 --> 27:43.168
I don't want to see you tossed
out when this hits the fan.

27:43.202 --> 27:44.536
But Voight's in too deep.

27:44.571 --> 27:47.072
You know, I've seen just
about everything this city

27:47.106 --> 27:48.674
could shove at a cop,

27:48.708 --> 27:50.175
and the one thing I've learned...

27:50.209 --> 27:51.810
don't ever count out Voight.

27:51.845 --> 27:53.278
That's your choice?

27:53.312 --> 27:55.681
Don't put me in a position
where I have to make one.

28:00.219 --> 28:03.221
You ready, Detective?

28:03.256 --> 28:04.789
Detective?

28:04.823 --> 28:06.224
Yeah?

28:06.259 --> 28:08.693
You ready?

28:08.727 --> 28:10.028
Yeah. Sorry.

28:10.062 --> 28:12.197
You know, no one said

28:12.231 --> 28:16.066
it was gonna be easy
working with Hank Voight.

28:16.101 --> 28:18.068
I was warned a million times.

28:18.103 --> 28:22.473
But I got to say this.

28:22.508 --> 28:25.142
I've seen a lot of
crackerjack police punch in,

28:25.176 --> 28:28.078
sleepwalk, and then punch
out again, never him.

28:28.113 --> 28:30.247
He works cases hard,

28:30.282 --> 28:32.783
works witnesses, works the streets.

28:32.817 --> 28:35.485
If I had someone I
cared about in a bad way,

28:35.520 --> 28:38.122
the one cop I would
want assigned to the case

28:38.156 --> 28:39.156
is Hank Voight...

28:39.190 --> 28:41.792
no one else, not even you, Detective.

28:43.628 --> 28:46.830
Okay.

28:46.864 --> 28:49.666
Let's have a smile...

28:49.700 --> 28:51.635
or not. That's fine.

28:51.669 --> 28:54.137
On one, two, three.

28:58.042 --> 28:59.443
What the hell were you thinking?

28:59.477 --> 29:01.010
I didn't know, okay?

29:01.045 --> 29:03.146
I didn't know he was gonna kill that guy.

29:03.180 --> 29:05.181
One second I'm standing there,

29:05.215 --> 29:06.549
and the next, pop, pop.

29:06.583 --> 29:08.084
And this dude just falls to the ground,

29:08.118 --> 29:10.920
straight down, like somebody
flipped a switch, you know.

29:10.955 --> 29:13.423
He had blood coming from
his mouth and his nose,

29:13.457 --> 29:15.524
- and it was just...
- Justin.

29:15.559 --> 29:17.026
You know that he was laying there,

29:17.061 --> 29:20.729
and he reached out to me for
help, and I just stood there?

29:20.764 --> 29:23.031
I couldn't even move my
feet. I wanted to run.

29:23.066 --> 29:26.702
I wanted to do something. I
just stood there, you know.

29:26.736 --> 29:29.872
Catalano... Catalano
raised his gun up at me,

29:29.906 --> 29:31.807
and he said I had to
help him move the body,

29:31.842 --> 29:33.876
or he was gonna drop
me right then and there.

29:33.910 --> 29:36.278
Erin, I swear to God, I had no choice.

29:36.312 --> 29:38.546
You need to get it together right now.

29:38.581 --> 29:40.048
Erin, I got to run, okay?

29:40.083 --> 29:43.218
I got to run right now.
I need you to help me.

29:43.252 --> 29:44.686
I'm a dead man, you know.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.954
Get in my car.

29:45.989 --> 29:47.555
You're gonna help me?

29:47.590 --> 29:50.692
We're gonna help each
other. Get in the car.

29:56.131 --> 29:57.398
You were just going to walk up,

29:57.432 --> 30:00.034
shoot Ross in the middle
of the street, huh?

30:00.068 --> 30:02.737
Let me ask you something.

30:02.771 --> 30:05.974
How stupid are you?

30:06.008 --> 30:10.144
I got a damn good insurance policy.

30:10.178 --> 30:13.080
You got a lot of enemies too.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.982
Now, who's worried about that

30:15.017 --> 30:18.019
when you got the protection
of the Chicago P.D.?

30:18.173 --> 30:21.475
You sure about that?

30:25.313 --> 30:28.915
Let me tell you something...

30:28.950 --> 30:32.719
Justin's next ride behind
bars, he is gonna get shanked...

30:32.754 --> 30:34.721
Or worse.

30:34.756 --> 30:37.490
So, if you want that to happen,

30:37.525 --> 30:39.760
then you test me.

30:48.502 --> 30:51.837
Tell him what you told me.

31:16.796 --> 31:19.798
Antonio's waiting for you in your office.

31:32.679 --> 31:34.645
There better be a damn good reason

31:34.680 --> 31:38.016
why my son is in the interrogation room,

31:38.050 --> 31:41.086
and I wasn't notified immediately!

31:49.333 --> 31:52.769
You have a problem.

31:54.537 --> 31:57.973
Internal Affairs...

31:58.008 --> 32:02.044
Gradishar came to me, wanted
to make a deal for you.

32:07.583 --> 32:11.252
Gradishar knows all about you and Colo.

32:11.287 --> 32:15.590
Your son was dumb, but he was a dupe.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.626
Catalano's the target.

32:22.231 --> 32:25.867
So, as far as I'm concerned,
I never saw that photo.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.635
I never heard him say he was there.

32:29.871 --> 32:32.573
And I'm going to move on to
the next Intelligence file.

33:09.177 --> 33:12.245
Let's take a ride.

33:20.220 --> 33:23.857
Sergeant, a moment of your time.

33:23.891 --> 33:25.959
Spill it, Burgess. I'm busy as hell.

33:25.993 --> 33:28.628
I think you're going to
want to retake our pictures.

33:28.662 --> 33:31.531
Too late. The photos are
being uploaded tonight.

33:31.565 --> 33:32.932
And like I said, I'm busy.

33:32.967 --> 33:36.268
Okay, I understand.

33:36.303 --> 33:40.039
But it's just that, see,
I have something here

33:40.073 --> 33:42.508
that I was gonna use to spice up

33:42.542 --> 33:46.945
the "faces and places" part
of our newsletter this month.

33:52.184 --> 33:54.820
You contacted my mother?

33:54.854 --> 33:57.122
I told her we were honoring
you with a surprise party,

33:57.156 --> 33:58.757
asked if she had any childhood photos

33:58.791 --> 34:01.393
we could use for a slide show.

34:01.427 --> 34:03.695
She's a real nice lady...

34:03.730 --> 34:06.697
real helpful.

34:06.732 --> 34:08.599
You're playing with fire.

34:08.634 --> 34:11.436
I brought plenty of water.

34:19.543 --> 34:21.645
- Hey, Jin.
- Yeah?

34:21.679 --> 34:24.181
That video from India...

34:24.215 --> 34:26.683
you never got it.

34:26.717 --> 34:28.752
The one I deleted two hours ago?

34:28.786 --> 34:31.788
I have no idea what you're talking about.

34:36.761 --> 34:39.462
I gave you every chance in the world.

34:39.496 --> 34:40.697
I got your record expunged.

34:40.731 --> 34:43.099
I didn't need you to do that, dad.

34:43.134 --> 34:47.370
Are you ready to shut
your mouth and listen?

34:47.404 --> 34:50.339
After what we went
through with your mother...

34:52.409 --> 34:53.609
I was ready to die in the dirt

34:53.643 --> 34:55.378
to make sure you found your feet.

34:55.411 --> 34:57.180
Hell, I almost did.

34:59.082 --> 35:00.583
I kept saying, "it's not his fault."

35:00.617 --> 35:03.618
It's not his fault. I can fix this."

35:06.622 --> 35:09.491
Except I realized...

35:09.525 --> 35:13.461
you can't fix what's broken on the inside.

35:16.265 --> 35:19.267
Dad, I messed up. I know that.

35:19.302 --> 35:21.336
I know it.

35:21.370 --> 35:24.673
I don't think you do.

35:34.850 --> 35:37.318
I'll see you in four years.

35:42.991 --> 35:44.192
Dad.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.659
I love you.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.731
Now go.

36:22.563 --> 36:25.331
Wine for you, my love.

36:25.366 --> 36:26.399
So new rule.

36:26.433 --> 36:27.700
Yeah?

36:27.735 --> 36:31.137
I ask you how your day
was and you say, "fine,"

36:31.171 --> 36:33.373
I get to reach across this
table and throttle you.

36:33.407 --> 36:35.808
Mm. Sounds fun.

36:35.842 --> 36:38.611
How was your day?

36:38.646 --> 36:39.979
It was fine.

36:42.582 --> 36:44.449
You must've known that was coming. Come on.

36:44.484 --> 36:45.651
Okay.

36:45.685 --> 36:47.052
I'll just ask your partner.

36:47.087 --> 36:49.421
Good luck with that one.
Getting that guy to...

36:49.455 --> 36:51.423
You have a good day, huh?

36:51.457 --> 36:53.025
Sneakiest guy I know.

36:53.059 --> 36:54.927
I'm so glad you could make it. Hi.

36:54.961 --> 36:56.695
- What are you doing here?
- How you doing?

36:56.729 --> 36:58.363
Well, your beautiful bride-to-be
invited me out for a drink.

36:58.398 --> 37:00.332
- Move over. Scoot over.
- Yes, sir.

37:00.366 --> 37:02.801
Plus, I thought maybe I'd step out

37:02.835 --> 37:04.503
and spread a little bit of my misery.

37:05.605 --> 37:07.071
I'd say I'd drink to that,

37:07.106 --> 37:09.007
but I don't know if that makes
for a very good toast there, Al.

37:09.041 --> 37:10.942
Well, hey.

37:10.976 --> 37:13.545
- You get these?
- What do you think?

37:13.579 --> 37:16.781
Getting after it tonight.

37:16.816 --> 37:19.717
So, Alvin, tell me about Adam.

37:19.751 --> 37:21.286
How's he doing in...

37:21.320 --> 37:23.922
what's it called... Intelligence?

37:23.956 --> 37:26.757
- Intelligence, yeah.
- You want the truth?

37:34.132 --> 37:37.267
I think he's, uh, better
at it than I was...

37:40.271 --> 37:43.941
maybe than I am.

37:43.975 --> 37:45.943
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

37:45.977 --> 37:48.411
Now, that's a toast. Come here.

37:48.446 --> 37:50.380
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Al.

37:50.414 --> 37:51.982
Got my heart all aflutter.

37:55.486 --> 38:00.123
What the hell is going on around here?

38:00.158 --> 38:03.660
It's Voight. Just let it go.

38:03.694 --> 38:05.762
What about the bet?

38:05.796 --> 38:10.299
Well, technically, you did lose.

38:10.334 --> 38:13.169
He buried the footage, didn't he?

38:15.205 --> 38:16.439
Got it.

38:16.474 --> 38:19.308
Well, I guess I'm not paying for dinner.

38:19.343 --> 38:24.480
It's probably better we just
keep it professional, right?

38:24.514 --> 38:25.781
Yeah, yeah.

38:32.856 --> 38:35.791
Hey, they just dredged
a body out of the river.

39:08.958 --> 39:10.991
- Got it?
- Yeah.

39:27.976 --> 39:29.843
That's Catalano, huh?

39:29.877 --> 39:31.812
Yeah.

39:31.846 --> 39:36.083
Well, he had a lot of enemies.

39:41.156 --> 39:45.024
Funny how justice works in
this city sometimes, huh?

40:00.007 --> 40:02.175
What the hell was that, Detective, huh?

40:02.209 --> 40:04.914
You're supposed to be
building a case on Voight,

40:04.919 --> 40:06.119
and you got nothing.

40:06.153 --> 40:08.154
You gave me nothing!

40:08.188 --> 40:10.556
He has somehow wriggled
his way off the hook,

40:10.590 --> 40:15.395
and I look like a fool.

40:15.429 --> 40:19.331
I look like a fool!

40:19.365 --> 40:21.266
Or worse!

40:23.603 --> 40:27.072
You don't remember me, do you?

40:27.106 --> 40:29.308
What?

40:29.342 --> 40:33.912
15 years ago, you were a
patrolman in Internal Affairs.

40:33.947 --> 40:37.149
You investigated my partner Sean Patterson.

40:37.183 --> 40:41.486
You went after him for some
double-dipped overtime pay,

40:41.520 --> 40:44.622
some paperwork that he
admitted he filed mistakenly.

40:44.657 --> 40:46.591
It should've been a slap on the wrist,

40:46.625 --> 40:48.793
but you wanted to make
a name for yourself...

40:50.128 --> 40:53.230
make an example of him...

40:53.265 --> 40:55.667
because you're a climber.

40:55.701 --> 40:58.302
You always have been.

40:58.337 --> 41:02.106
The union fought his charges,
and you went after him harder.

41:02.140 --> 41:04.943
You took away his pension,

41:04.977 --> 41:07.378
bounced him from the job.

41:10.148 --> 41:12.383
He killed himself a year later.

41:14.953 --> 41:16.887
His family lost a father

41:16.921 --> 41:19.756
because you used him as the
bottom rung of your ladder.

41:33.304 --> 41:34.771
You don't know.

41:34.806 --> 41:37.374
You don't know what we do

41:37.408 --> 41:41.944
or what we sacrifice or
the price we pay for this...

41:44.648 --> 41:47.117
for the job.

41:48.619 --> 41:50.620
And you'll never know.
