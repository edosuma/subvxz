It possesses enormous power,
and brings endless pleasure--

00:07.090 --> 00:10.968
and destruction-- to those who are destined.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.167
I got a new coffeemaker.

04:12.252 --> 04:17.297
No, no, you have real heart
when you press the button, you do!

04:17.382 --> 04:19.174
Oh, it's Tozawa-chan.

04:23.846 --> 04:27.557
Hey! Don't forget our
group date with the nice gals!

12:39.258 --> 12:45.388
Really?! Lucky! I get to have
some more of your homemade food!

12:45.473 --> 12:49.768
Say, why don't we just have a party?
The kitchen is big...

12:49.852 --> 12:51.394
I'd love that!

12:51.479 --> 12:54.230
That okay with you, Missy?

12:54.315 --> 12:58.735
Most certainly is.
I think i'll make something, too...

13:54.333 --> 13:55.834
Forgive my rudeness.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.297
Congratulations on the award, Wadou-san.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.716
Oh, how nice of you to come.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.184
You drink too much at parties, Mom!

23:15.268 --> 23:17.061
You know you shouldn‘t drink!

23:17.145 --> 23:18.396
You get drunk so easily!

23:18.480 --> 23:21.565
You're finally wearing a pretty dress,
and it goes to waste!

23:21.650 --> 23:25.569
You didn't come home,
so Chou-san and the others were worried!

23:25.654 --> 23:29.115
But I‘m glad I finally got to meet your boss!

23:29.199 --> 23:32.618
You talked bad about him,
but I really like him!

23:32.702 --> 23:34.870
He‘s much better than Tozawa-chan!

23:34.955 --> 23:36.997
He'd probably be even better
if he didn‘t have a hangover!

23:37.082 --> 23:39.875
You should marry him, Mom!
