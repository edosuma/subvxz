- Years

00:09.844 --> 00:11.471
Since we brought Zuri

00:11.472 --> 00:13.097
home from Uganda.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.099
So Gotcha Day is the day

00:15.100 --> 00:16.976
to celebrate the arrival

00:13.222 --> 00:16.976
of an adopted child?

00:17.101 --> 00:18.101
Exactly.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.896
Gotcha.

(LAUGHING)

00:22.022 --> 00:23.232
Ew!

00:23.357 --> 00:24.859
Bertram! This coffee table

00:24.860 --> 00:26.360
is a sticky mess.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.779
What? I wiped

00:27.780 --> 00:29.071
it down earlier.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.137
And I'd be delighted

00:32.139 --> 00:33.952
to do it again.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.099
Oh, may I say, ma'am,

00:35.100 --> 00:36.120
I know you've given

00:34.076 --> 00:36.120
up modeling,

00:36.245 --> 00:37.893
but those

00:37.894 --> 00:39.540
ankles are still

00:36.245 --> 00:39.540
runway ready.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.292
- (LAUGHS)
- Oh, well.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.002
Wow. You can

00:43.003 --> 00:44.587
mop up and kiss up

00:41.417 --> 00:44.587
at the same time.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.088
- I hope you
- stretched first.

Luke, I think you accidentally

01:14.723 --> 01:16.995
grabbed stink bombs

01:12.448 --> 01:16.995
instead of smoke bombs.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.955
- You think?
- My brain is melting.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.374
- I really should
- organize my prank bag.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.169
I mean, this was

01:24.170 --> 01:25.837
just unprofessional.

01:25.962 --> 01:27.192
Bertram, can

01:27.193 --> 01:28.422
you please

01:25.962 --> 01:28.422
clean this up?

break from - Tiger-mommying Kipling

05:05.472 --> 05:07.329
To help me brainstorm

05:07.330 --> 05:09.185
my ideas for Zuri's party?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.582
I want to do something

05:10.583 --> 05:11.854
different from her birthday

05:09.309 --> 05:11.854
two months ago.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.564
As someone who was in

05:13.565 --> 05:15.149
the bouncy house with you

05:11.979 --> 05:15.149
when you threw up,

05:15.274 --> 05:17.401
I support that.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.420
- Christina gave me - this list,
but it's just - Endless variations

05:19.444 --> 05:21.989
Of rainbows and unicorns.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.512
For my Gotcha Day,

05:23.513 --> 05:24.909
I would like

05:22.114 --> 05:24.909
an Indian theme.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.348
Maybe we could

05:26.349 --> 05:27.661
get some curry

05:25.034 --> 05:27.661
up in here,

05:27.786 --> 05:29.893
a snake charmer,

05:29.894 --> 05:31.999
a Taj Mahal

05:27.786 --> 05:31.999
ice sculpture...

05:32.124 --> 05:33.727
- Ooh! That's what
- we should do for Zuri!

05:33.751 --> 05:35.649
I highly doubt we

05:35.650 --> 05:37.546
can get a Taj Mahal

05:33.751 --> 05:37.546
carved in time.

05:37.671 --> 05:41.633
Maybe a Gandhi.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.615
No, I mean Zuri's Gotcha Day

05:43.616 --> 05:45.470
should reflect where

05:41.759 --> 05:45.470
she came from.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.014

05:48.851 --> 05:50.559
drop babies off

05:47.139 --> 05:50.559
in Africa, too?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.436
Or is it a flamingo?

05:52.561 --> 05:54.251

your chili on the floor.

06:18.359 --> 06:19.421
cruelty to roaches.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.933
on your shirt, huh?

- (RETCHES) - Not chili!

lick a taxi cab seat.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.799
your party decorations?

07:45.924 --> 07:46.947
No, I know

07:46.948 --> 07:47.968
what's out there.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.304
Unicorns, rainbows,

07:50.305 --> 07:52.514
the yoozhe! I can't wait.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.640
And, uh, what if

07:53.641 --> 07:54.641
there were no

07:52.639 --> 07:54.641
unicorns or rainbows?

07:57.728 --> 07:59.397
That's a world

07:59.398 --> 08:01.065
I would not

07:57.728 --> 08:01.065
want to live in.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.360
Me neither!

08:04.361 --> 08:05.569
Gotcha!

08:03.150 --> 08:05.569
(LAUGHS)

08:05.694 --> 08:06.904
All right, now, now,

08:06.905 --> 08:08.113
go hang out in your room

08:05.694 --> 08:08.113
until your party's ready.

08:08.239 --> 08:09.240
Okay.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.348
I hope I can return

08:12.349 --> 08:13.411
a gently used lion.

08:20.376 --> 08:22.169
Done. And the happy look

08:22.170 --> 08:23.962
on Zuri's face will

08:20.376 --> 08:23.962
make up for the fact

08:24.088 --> 08:26.048
that this tick on my neck

08:26.049 --> 08:28.008
has just drained out my blood.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.157
Zuri didn't want Africa.

08:31.158 --> 08:32.511
She wanted the yoozhe!

08:32.636 --> 08:34.139
She's not gonna look happy.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.640
She's gonna look like this.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.498
She will

08:38.499 --> 08:40.145
look constipated?

08:41.980 --> 08:43.148
No, no,

08:43.149 --> 08:44.316
that was my sad face.

08:44.442 --> 08:46.278
See, now I understand

08:46.279 --> 08:48.112
why my drama teacher

08:44.442 --> 08:48.112
gave me a D.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.780
- And that basket
- of bran muffins.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.160
(SNORING)

09:02.667 --> 09:04.858
Aah. Wha...

09:04.859 --> 09:07.047
Look at this mess!

09:09.258 --> 09:10.134
(GOATS BLEATING)

09:10.259 --> 09:11.260
Oh!

09:12.761 --> 09:13.887
What are goats

09:13.888 --> 09:15.013
doing in here?

09:15.139 --> 09:18.309
We destroy, you clean.

09:18.434 --> 09:21.728
It's the Circle of Messes.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.943
No! Stop it! Stop it!

09:28.068 --> 09:29.528
- You goats are
- gonna get me fired!

09:31.363 --> 09:33.365
Bertram? Bertram!

09:33.491 --> 09:34.721
Oh!

09:34.722 --> 09:35.951
(LAUGHS)

09:36.076 --> 09:37.223
Bertram, what

09:37.224 --> 09:38.370
are you doing?

09:38.496 --> 09:40.143
Oh. I just had

09:40.144 --> 09:41.790
the craziest dream!

09:41.915 --> 09:42.916
There were these

09:42.917 --> 09:43.917
four talking goats

09:41.915 --> 09:43.917
making a huge mess.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.297
Hey, a baby goat

09:48.298 --> 09:50.299
is a kid.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.676
I bet we are

09:51.677 --> 09:52.926
the kids in

09:50.424 --> 09:52.926
your dream!

09:53.051 --> 09:55.346
Oh. I am so insightful.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.348
- I should totally be
- a seismologist.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.645
I guess I've been so worried

10:02.646 --> 10:04.688
about getting fired because

10:00.600 --> 10:04.688
of your messes,

10:04.813 --> 10:06.023
I... I've been

10:06.024 --> 10:07.232
sleepwalking.

10:07.358 --> 10:08.900
More like sleep-messing!

10:09.026 --> 10:10.653
Oh, by the way,

10:10.654 --> 10:12.279
if one of those goats

10:09.026 --> 10:12.279
in your dream was

10:12.404 --> 10:13.405
really handsome

10:13.406 --> 10:14.406
and break-dancing,

10:12.404 --> 10:14.406
that was me.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.326
(BOTH LAUGHING)

10:20.787 --> 10:22.706
I'm warning you,

10:22.707 --> 10:24.624
if you ever have kids,

10:20.787 --> 10:24.624
I'll make omelets out of them.

10:27.378 --> 10:29.317
I should've just stuck to

10:29.318 --> 10:31.256
Christina's list, but no,

10:31.382 --> 10:32.737
I had to think

10:32.738 --> 10:34.092
outside the box!

10:34.218 --> 10:35.678
And now there's

10:35.679 --> 10:37.137
no time to get back

10:34.218 --> 10:37.137
in the stinking box!

10:37.262 --> 10:39.806
Jessie, calm down.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.100
(GASPS) Maybe we

10:42.101 --> 10:44.269
could paint a rainbow

10:39.931 --> 10:44.269
over the savannah.

10:44.395 --> 10:45.396
Or better yet,

10:45.397 --> 10:46.397
a double rainbow

10:44.395 --> 10:46.397
all the way!

10:49.441 --> 10:51.631
That's a great idea!

10:51.632 --> 10:53.820
We can just Zuri-fy

10:49.441 --> 10:53.820
everything!

10:53.945 --> 10:54.946
Uh...

10:57.408 --> 10:59.556
There. That looks

10:59.557 --> 11:01.703
like a unicorn.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.623
No, it looks like a zebra

11:03.624 --> 11:05.416
in need of immediate

11:01.828 --> 11:05.416
medical attention.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.150
Big news!

11:10.151 --> 11:11.422
Bertram finally snapped.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.383
Who had April

11:13.384 --> 11:15.217
in the betting pool?

11:15.342 --> 11:16.531
Whoa! Why does

11:16.532 --> 11:17.719
the terrace look

11:15.342 --> 11:17.719
like Puerto Rico?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.263
Oh, it's Africa!

11:19.388 --> 11:20.431
Oh! Here, just

11:20.432 --> 11:21.473
put me out

11:19.388 --> 11:21.473
of my misery.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.018
Just like I did

11:23.019 --> 11:24.435
to this poor chump.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.438
- Jessie, this will
- be good for Zuri.

11:27.563 --> 11:28.752
I mean, we're

11:28.753 --> 11:29.940
all spoiled,

11:30.065 --> 11:32.625
- and we need - to experience bitter
- Disappointments like this.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.029
- Yeah. I think
- it's cool.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.281
For my Gotcha Day party,

11:37.282 --> 11:38.407
I want lots of stuff

11:36.154 --> 11:38.407
from my birthplace.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.493
You got it. This whole place

11:40.494 --> 11:42.453
will be covered with

11:38.532 --> 11:42.453
decorations from...

11:43.495 --> 11:44.598
- Wait, where
- were you born?

11:44.622 --> 11:47.916
Oh, it's a super story.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.669
Eight years ago, Mom,

11:49.670 --> 11:51.295
Dad, and Emma were

11:48.041 --> 11:51.295
walking in the park...

11:53.589 --> 11:55.362
Oh, Christina,

11:55.363 --> 11:57.134
we are so blessed.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.094
- My new movie
- is a blockbuster smash.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.260
- And my new line of perfume - is stinking
up magazines - All over the world.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.039
We have everything

12:07.040 --> 12:09.187
we could ever want

12:04.891 --> 12:09.187
from life. Except...

12:09.313 --> 12:10.981
- BOTH: The child
- of our dreams.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.109
Not cool, Mom and Dad.

12:14.110 --> 12:15.735
Totes not cool.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.238
(WHOOSHING)

12:19.239 --> 12:20.240
(CRASHING)

12:25.162 --> 12:26.163
He's adorable!

12:28.915 --> 12:29.916
And strong.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.046
- Hey! Watch it,
- Super Brat!

12:36.214 --> 12:37.299
Mama. Daddy!

12:38.300 --> 12:40.218
BOTH: Oh!

12:40.344 --> 12:42.179
- Can we keep him?
- Can we keep him?

12:43.180 --> 12:44.389
No!

12:44.515 --> 12:45.516
Oh, of course.

12:45.517 --> 12:46.517
We'll give him

12:44.515 --> 12:46.517
Emma's room.

12:47.685 --> 12:49.394
No!

12:49.520 --> 12:50.542
Emma, meet your

12:50.543 --> 12:51.563
new super brother.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.817
EMMA: No!

12:55.942 --> 12:57.089
Stop telling people

12:57.090 --> 12:58.236
you threw me

12:55.942 --> 12:58.236
into the sun!

13:00.113 --> 13:02.199
Luke, are you implying

13:02.200 --> 13:04.284
that you're actually

13:00.113 --> 13:04.284
from Krypton?

13:04.409 --> 13:05.870
Yup. You wanna go

13:05.871 --> 13:07.329
to my Fortress of Solitude?

13:07.454 --> 13:08.455
Nope.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.916
We adopted

13:10.917 --> 13:12.250
Luke from Detroit,

13:12.376 --> 13:14.128
and his only superpower

13:14.129 --> 13:15.879
is the ability to clog toilets

13:12.376 --> 13:15.879
with a single poop.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.863
Although Luke's

13:19.864 --> 13:21.301
origin story is

13:18.423 --> 13:21.301
quite fantastical,

13:21.426 --> 13:23.137
my Gotcha Day story

13:23.138 --> 13:24.846
is amazing and true.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.285
I remember it like

13:26.286 --> 13:27.599
it was only months ago,

13:24.971 --> 13:27.599
which it was.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.736
Your home is like a palace.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.007
Well, now it's

13:40.008 --> 13:41.154
your home too.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.989
- Welcome to your
- new room, buddy.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.888
We hope you'll love it.

13:44.889 --> 13:46.660
But you know,

13:43.114 --> 13:46.660
it's not quite ready yet.

13:46.785 --> 13:50.625
- RAVI: Mrs. Mommy and Mr. Daddy - must have thought
Mr. Kipling - Was going to be a baby lizard,

13:52.750 --> 13:54.126
Because they bought

13:54.127 --> 13:55.502
him a small wooden

13:52.750 --> 13:55.502
cage to sleep in.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.787
- Silly them. Everyone knows - rocking a
lizard will put him - Into attack mode.

14:07.723 --> 14:10.963
- They bought him tiny outfits, - a teddy
bear for a chew toy, - And even diapers.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.669
I appreciated the thought,

14:15.670 --> 14:17.733
even though Mr. Kipling

14:13.604 --> 14:17.733
is more of

14:17.857 --> 14:20.860
a boxer-briefs kind of guy.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.185
- Wait, wait.
- Hold the phone.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.007
- It sounds like your parents
- were expecting a baby

14:25.031 --> 14:26.450
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Shh!

14:26.575 --> 14:28.056
Wha... Which I'm sure

14:28.057 --> 14:29.536
is not the case.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.143
No, I mean, like,

14:31.144 --> 14:32.623
what do I know? Nothing.

14:29.661 --> 14:32.623
I know nothing.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.500
- Luke, Emma?
- Is this true?

14:35.626 --> 14:37.899
Did Mrs. Mommy and Mr. Daddy

14:37.900 --> 14:40.171
think I would be a baby?

14:40.297 --> 14:42.549
(LUKE AND EMMA WHISTLING)

14:42.674 --> 14:44.426
So it is true!

14:44.551 --> 14:46.074
They wanted a baby!

14:46.075 --> 14:47.596
But I am not a baby.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.307
(SOBS)

14:52.183 --> 14:54.269
Hey, Ravi. Ravi,

14:54.270 --> 14:56.354
I am so sorry!

14:52.183 --> 14:56.354
I didn't mean to upset you.

14:57.815 --> 14:58.816
What is upsetting

14:58.817 --> 14:59.817
is that my family wanted

14:57.815 --> 14:59.817
a baby instead of me!

15:03.737 --> 15:06.072
Who told you that?

15:06.197 --> 15:07.783
Jessie.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.013
No, no, no, I didn't!

15:09.014 --> 15:10.118
I mean, I did,

15:07.907 --> 15:10.118
but I didn't mean to!

15:10.243 --> 15:12.162
- Curse my laser-like
- deductive reasoning!

15:14.205 --> 15:15.457
I never thought I would

15:15.458 --> 15:16.708
find a family to adopt me,

15:16.834 --> 15:18.419
and when you did,

15:18.420 --> 15:20.003
it was the happiest

15:16.834 --> 15:20.003
day of my life.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.776
But now,

15:21.777 --> 15:23.423
I realize I was

15:20.128 --> 15:23.423
just a disappointment!

15:23.548 --> 15:25.269
- Ravi, no! - You're not
- A disappointment.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.594
(GROANS)

15:27.719 --> 15:29.221
Ravi! Ravi, wait!

15:29.222 --> 15:30.722
Let us explain!

15:32.641 --> 15:33.642
(DOOR SLAMS)

15:36.854 --> 15:39.002
I once fired a nanny

15:39.003 --> 15:41.149
just for wearing plaid.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.715
So imagine what

15:43.716 --> 15:46.154
I'm going to do to you!

15:46.279 --> 15:47.426
Listen, we were

15:47.427 --> 15:48.573
gonna have to tell him

15:46.279 --> 15:48.573
sooner or later.

15:48.699 --> 15:49.700
Thanks to Jessie,

15:49.701 --> 15:50.701
it's sooner.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.288
We weren't going

15:54.289 --> 15:55.330
to tell Ravi until

15:53.244 --> 15:55.330
after we died!

15:55.455 --> 15:57.290
- Well, how were you
- going to do that?

15:57.415 --> 15:58.500
I don't know, seance?

15:58.501 --> 15:59.584
Time machine? We hadn't

15:57.415 --> 15:59.584
worked out the details!

16:07.467 --> 16:08.844
- Ravi?
- Ravi?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.053
Are you in here?

16:11.054 --> 16:13.014
Marco?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.203
Polo!

16:14.204 --> 16:15.266
(GRUNTS)

16:15.392 --> 16:16.560
You tricked me.

16:16.561 --> 16:17.728
Now go away.

16:17.853 --> 16:19.974
- I'm busy pouting - like the baby you
- Wished I was.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.192
All right, well, if you're

16:24.193 --> 16:25.944
not coming out,

16:22.440 --> 16:25.944
then I'm crawling in.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.905
- Oh. Friendly tip?
- Go in this side.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.322
The other side

16:29.323 --> 16:30.615
is where Mr. Kipling

16:28.029 --> 16:30.615
does his business.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.639
Sweetie, you know

16:33.640 --> 16:35.119
how much we love you.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.955
I am so sorry

16:36.956 --> 16:38.665
we didn't tell you

16:35.245 --> 16:38.665
the truth earlier.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.792
This thing's pretty cool.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.436
- We need to - get one of these
- In our room.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.587
Morgan!

16:43.712 --> 16:44.713
Right after we

16:44.714 --> 16:45.714
solve this family crisis.

16:45.839 --> 16:46.840
See, Ravi, the orphanage

16:46.841 --> 16:47.841
told us your birth date

16:45.839 --> 16:47.841
was in 2011,

16:51.177 --> 16:52.491
so we thought

16:52.492 --> 16:53.805
we were getting a baby.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.745
But it was a typo,

16:55.746 --> 16:57.559
'cause you were born in 2001.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.248
But we didn't care

16:59.249 --> 17:00.812
how old you were.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.812
We just wanted you.

17:00.938 --> 17:02.564
And thank goodness we got you,

17:02.565 --> 17:04.190
because changing diapers

17:00.938 --> 17:04.190
is totes gross.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.445
And plus, I couldn't

17:09.446 --> 17:11.030
play catch with a baby.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.782
Well, not that you're

17:12.784 --> 17:14.409
great at catch.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.368
- But you play
- a mean game of drop.

17:18.914 --> 17:20.645
Thank you, siblings,

17:20.646 --> 17:22.375
for trying to make me

17:18.914 --> 17:22.375
feel like I belong.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.501
(SIGHS)

17:25.796 --> 17:27.631
You do belong.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.796
- There is no doubt in - my mind that
you're the kid - We were meant to have.

17:34.304 --> 17:35.949
- There is no doubt - in my mind that
- I'm gonna cry

17:35.973 --> 17:37.454
At this incredibly sweet

17:37.455 --> 17:38.934
family moment.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.249
(GASPS)

17:41.250 --> 17:42.562
Thank you, Kipling.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.586
So, yes.

17:45.587 --> 17:46.858
We were expecting

17:44.314 --> 17:46.858
a baby.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.339
But all we really

17:48.340 --> 17:49.694
wanted was a great kid.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.114
And you are one

17:52.115 --> 17:54.407
of the greatest kids

17:49.820 --> 17:54.407
in the whole world.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.410
Well, it's hard

17:56.411 --> 17:58.286
to argue with

17:54.532 --> 17:58.286
such solid logic.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.103
And now that you're here,

18:02.104 --> 18:03.124
our family is complete.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.295
Thank you, guys.

18:06.296 --> 18:07.629
Family hug?

18:07.754 --> 18:08.755
Mmm.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.757
(ALL LAUGHING)

18:15.136 --> 18:17.327
Complete?

18:17.328 --> 18:19.516
That means they're

18:15.136 --> 18:19.516
done having kids.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.438
What is this I'm feeling?

18:24.439 --> 18:26.815
Wha... Is it? Is it?

18:26.940 --> 18:29.193
Yes, it is.

18:29.194 --> 18:31.444
(LAUGHING)

18:26.940 --> 18:31.444
It's joy!

18:32.487 --> 18:34.739
Joy!

18:34.865 --> 18:36.179
Wait. There's

18:36.180 --> 18:37.492
somebody missing

18:34.865 --> 18:37.492
from this family hug.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.618
MORGAN: Yeah.

18:38.743 --> 18:39.786
Jessie?

18:40.787 --> 18:41.788
Where's Zuri?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.085
Oh, yeah, Zuri.

18:46.086 --> 18:47.377
Be right back.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.171
Okay.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.362
Let's get this

18:52.363 --> 18:53.550
party started!

18:54.718 --> 18:56.324
Yeah, yeah.

18:56.325 --> 18:57.929
About that.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.494
I'm so afraid you won't

18:59.495 --> 19:00.932
like what I've arranged

18:58.055 --> 19:00.932
for your Gotcha Day.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.351
Everything will be okay,

19:02.352 --> 19:03.643
as long as there's cake.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.063
Ah...

19:06.187 --> 19:07.355
No cake?

19:10.400 --> 19:11.985
- Why do you
- look constipated?

19:17.866 --> 19:19.096
Wow!

19:19.097 --> 19:20.326
Rainbows?

19:20.451 --> 19:21.786
Unicorns?

19:21.912 --> 19:24.081
And there is a cake!

19:24.205 --> 19:25.311
Jessie!

19:25.312 --> 19:26.416
Epic fake-out!

19:27.876 --> 19:30.045
It's a Gotcha Day miracle!

19:31.088 --> 19:32.089
Thank you, Jessie.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.009
(HORN BLOWING)

19:35.010 --> 19:36.927
Happy Gotcha Day, Zuri!

19:37.052 --> 19:38.533
Bertram, you

19:38.534 --> 19:40.013
butlering rascal.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.472
You were in on this, too?

19:41.598 --> 19:42.878
- (CHUCKLES)
- Guilty as charged.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.977
Bertram, how did

19:45.978 --> 19:47.478
you do all this?

19:47.604 --> 19:48.772
There's a closet

19:48.773 --> 19:49.940
full of party supplies

19:47.604 --> 19:49.940
at the ready.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.816
- And I got a cake guy
- on speed dial.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.277
I can have cake in my mouth

19:53.278 --> 19:54.611
in five minutes flat.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.611
Day or night.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.154
(BLOWS HORN)

19:56.279 --> 19:58.031
ALL: Happy Gotcha Day!

19:58.156 --> 19:59.365
(CHEERING)

19:59.490 --> 20:01.371
- I've gotcha, gotcha,
- gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.994
This is the best

20:02.995 --> 20:04.495
Gotcha Day ever!

20:01.492 --> 20:04.495
Nothing could top it.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.707
Oh! You think so, huh?

20:07.708 --> 20:08.708
Well, that sounds

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
like a challenge.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.011
You got me a zebra

20:20.012 --> 20:22.013
that can operate

20:18.009 --> 20:22.013
an elevator?

20:22.139 --> 20:24.141
I love it!

20:24.265 --> 20:26.206
Well, actually, sweetie,

20:26.207 --> 20:28.145
there was someone in

20:24.265 --> 20:28.145
the lobby who pushed the...

20:28.269 --> 20:30.349
- You know what? - Yeah, he's a really
- Smart zebra.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.566
- Whoa, the stripes
- don't rub off.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.715
Not like that painted donkey

20:35.716 --> 20:37.737
at the petting zoo

20:33.691 --> 20:37.737
my dad took me to.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.197
He's your zebra,

20:39.198 --> 20:40.531
but he's going to live at

20:37.862 --> 20:40.531
the Central Park Zoo.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.537
- We're letting them - adopt him, so
actually, - It's his Gotcha Day too.

20:46.163 --> 20:47.872
ALL: Aw.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.333
Come on, Zeebee,

20:49.334 --> 20:50.667
you can see your

20:47.998 --> 20:50.667
new home from here.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.252
But don't look down.

20:52.253 --> 20:53.711
If Chesterfield's

20:50.792 --> 20:53.711
in her bathing suit,

20:53.837 --> 20:54.922
she's gonna scare

20:54.923 --> 20:56.006
the stripes off of you.

20:57.966 --> 21:00.052
The coolest pet I ever got

21:00.053 --> 21:02.137
as a kid was a hamster that

20:57.966 --> 21:02.137
could sniff out land mines.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.868
He, he wasn't very good.

21:03.869 --> 21:05.473
Rest in peace,

21:02.261 --> 21:05.473
Captain Nibbles.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.233
Now, you're probably

21:14.234 --> 21:15.525
wondering why the terrace

21:12.939 --> 21:15.525
looks like Jumanji.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.443
I'm really...

21:17.568 --> 21:19.320
It's fantastic!

21:19.445 --> 21:21.093
Sorry I didn't

21:21.094 --> 21:22.740
show it to you

21:19.445 --> 21:22.740
sooner. Ta-da!

21:24.450 --> 21:25.535
This is so amazing!

21:25.660 --> 21:26.786
Totally.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.592
- Everything here - reminds me
- Of Uganda.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.624
Except for maybe this.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.461
It's a unicorn from

21:34.462 --> 21:36.129
where I'm from.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.089
It's a zebra-corn!

21:38.215 --> 21:39.215
It's so cool!

21:39.298 --> 21:40.341
Aw.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.177
Thank you, Jessie.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.991
Oh. I'm just thankful

21:43.992 --> 21:45.680
to be working for

21:42.301 --> 21:45.680
such a wonderful family.

21:47.598 --> 21:48.641
Hey, honey, look.

21:48.766 --> 21:49.809
It's your mom.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.853
(LAUGHING)

21:51.978 --> 21:53.499
- That's not funny.
- That's not funny.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.275
I can't wait to see

21:57.276 --> 21:58.860
what Jessie's gonna do

21:55.690 --> 21:58.860
for Luke's Gotcha Day.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.820
- Oh, I've got
- Detroit covered.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.635
I'm thinking some muscle cars

22:02.636 --> 22:04.323
and a Detroit River kiddy pool

22:00.945 --> 22:04.323
and, ooh!

22:04.448 --> 22:06.325
- Maybe we can rent
- Eminem for the night?

22:06.450 --> 22:08.224
Well, that's all great.

22:08.225 --> 22:09.996
But um, I actually told Luke

22:06.450 --> 22:09.996
he was from Krypton.

22:11.414 --> 22:12.874
Was that wrong?

22:17.712 --> 22:19.547
There. Spotless.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.112
There's not a speck

22:21.113 --> 22:22.550
of kid debris left.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.595
Aah! The cushions!

22:28.723 --> 22:31.809
It's the goats again!

22:31.935 --> 22:33.561
I must be dreaming.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.167
That's right, citizen.

22:35.168 --> 22:36.647
You are dreaming.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.983
Time to make a super mess.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.986
No! No! No!

22:40.987 --> 22:42.862
Aah!

22:42.987 --> 22:44.260
Goats! Mess!

22:44.261 --> 22:45.531
Mess!

22:45.656 --> 22:47.909
(GIGGLING)

22:48.034 --> 22:49.744
- He's definitely
- dreaming about us.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.413
Maybe we should wake him.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.998
Nah. Let him sleep.

22:54.124 --> 22:56.484
- He's getting more exercise
- than he does when he's awake.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.420
No!
