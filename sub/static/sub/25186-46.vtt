00:14.800 --> 00:16.960
Previously on Love Island...

00:18.960 --> 00:20.999
There was drama at the re-coupling.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Georgia is the person I want to be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with. I refuse to re-couple.</font>

00:28.800 --> 00:32.959
<font color="#00FFFF">The girl I would like to couple up</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with is Laura.</font>

00:32.960 --> 00:35.639
<font color="#11FF11">Laura.</font>

00:35.640 --> 00:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Alexandra.</font>

00:49.320 --> 00:52.959
Tonight...

00:52.960 --> 00:56.960
the romances are hotting up.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.959
(APPLAUSE)

01:35.960 --> 01:38.959
It was a difficult and emotional
choice,

01:38.960 --> 01:41.959
but in the end,
Alex decided to wear the world's

01:41.960 --> 01:44.959
loudest T-shirt to a re-coupling
that saw George and Sam leave

01:44.960 --> 01:48.000
the villa after they refused to
couple up with someone else.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I genuinely will miss those two.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Me too.</font>

02:03.960 --> 02:07.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Georgia was like the sister I didn't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">want.</font>

02:07.800 --> 02:10.959
<font color="#FFFF00">She annoys me but you still miss</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">them even though</font>

02:10.960 --> 02:11.960
<font color="#FFFF00">they are really annoying.</font>

02:11.961 --> 02:14.959
<font color="#00FFFF">She brought such big energy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">into the villa.</font>

02:14.960 --> 02:18.959
<font color="#00FFFF">When she came in here</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with her silly little, "Hi, boys!"</font>

02:18.960 --> 02:24.319
<font color="#00FFFF">and got us all at it, I feel</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like something is definitely going</font>

02:24.320 --> 02:27.639
<font color="#00FFFF">to be missing, a massive part</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of my heart because I love her.</font>

02:27.640 --> 02:31.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We have recoupled every time.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We have.</font>

02:31.960 --> 02:38.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a lovely thought.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I get nervous.</font>

02:38.960 --> 02:40.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like we should</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">keep doing that.</font>

02:40.960 --> 02:42.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll come into the kitchen</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and say I want</font>

02:42.960 --> 02:47.959
<font color="#FFFF00">to be with you because you make</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really nice breakfast.</font>

02:47.960 --> 02:53.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I will do it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I want that in return, please.</font>

02:53.960 --> 02:58.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I am looking forward to the future,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm genuinely looking forward to it.</font>

02:58.960 --> 03:01.959
Jack and Laura are now a couple, he
is planning to read a love letter

03:01.960 --> 03:04.959
he wrote to his beloved Laura
a few days ago.

03:04.960 --> 03:08.959
He has cunningly changed
the words air hostess to surfer.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.959
<font color="#11FF11">We are actually a couple, you know.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I know.</font>

03:11.960 --> 03:15.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm happy, I got what I wanted.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm happy.</font>

03:15.960 --> 03:17.959
<font color="#11FF11">I think everyone knows</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm happy, as well.</font>

03:17.960 --> 03:21.960
<font color="#11FF11">Everyone tells me to stop smiling.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know what to do!</font>

03:28.800 --> 03:30.959
Carpenter Paul coupled up
with Laura.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.959
She asked what gift
to give him to show her gratitude.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.479
I suggested giving him wood and she
slapped me in the face!

03:37.480 --> 03:38.959
I don't understand women.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I am obviously</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really happy that you picked me.</font>

03:42.960 --> 03:44.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Did you literally not have a clue?</font>

03:44.960 --> 03:47.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought, yesterday, a little bit.</font>

03:48.000 --> 03:49.959
<font color="#FFFF00">You were making such an effort,</font>

03:49.960 --> 03:53.959
<font color="#FFFF00">and then so you talk to Alexandra</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit.</font>

03:53.960 --> 03:55.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I know it is weird to say thanks,</font>

03:55.480 --> 03:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">but I am really grateful that you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">picked me. I am.</font>

03:59.960 --> 04:03.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It was probably the most</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">nerve-racking thing ever.</font>

04:03.960 --> 04:05.479
<font color="#FFFF00">My heart was racing</font>

04:05.480 --> 04:09.159
<font color="#FFFF00">and I was like, I have no idea</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">how this is going to go.</font>

04:09.160 --> 04:13.799
<font color="#00FFFF">Re-coupling is difficult and I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">think it</font>

04:13.800 --> 04:15.479
<font color="#00FFFF">is difficult to get your words</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">across.</font>

04:15.480 --> 04:16.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I think you did well.</font>

04:16.959 --> 04:21.319
<font color="#FFFF00">I hope so.</font>

04:21.320 --> 04:25.319
<font color="#00FFFF">I knew you weren't going to be like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she's so amazing.</font>

04:25.320 --> 04:27.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You don't know me that well,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">so I will let you off.</font>

04:27.960 --> 04:32.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I really like Paul,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he is so interesting, so handsome.</font>

04:32.640 --> 04:36.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Now I am really looking forward</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to just getting into bed</font>

04:36.960 --> 04:39.959
<font color="#00FFFF">with him tonight and just having</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a good old flirt and a natter.</font>

04:39.960 --> 04:42.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I am so happy that he picked me.</font>

04:42.960 --> 04:44.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I am intrigued by you and want to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get to</font>

04:44.960 --> 04:48.959
<font color="#FFFF00">know you, and continue on the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">journey of getting to know you.</font>

04:48.960 --> 04:52.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I will help you through this</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">journey. I promise.</font>

04:52.960 --> 04:55.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You are so cute and you smell</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really clean.</font>

04:55.960 --> 04:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">That's because I am clean! </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I know,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but at home, you have</font>

04:59.960 --> 05:02.959
<font color="#00FFFF">really good conditioning</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">treatments for your clothes.</font>

05:02.960 --> 05:08.959
<font color="#FFFF00">You are a clean freak.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I love it.</font>

05:08.960 --> 05:11.959
<font color="#FFFF00">You said earlier, you love cleaning.</font>

05:11.960 --> 05:15.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you not? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I love cleaning.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I am happy.</font>

05:15.960 --> 05:21.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm glad that we can</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">snuggle in bed.</font>

05:21.160 --> 05:28.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I am very affectionate.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I am, I love a cuddle.</font>

05:28.960 --> 05:30.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm looking forward</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to getting to know Laura.</font>

05:30.960 --> 05:32.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It is going to be nice. We have had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a laugh,</font>

05:32.960 --> 05:37.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I am looking forward to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">waking up tomorrow.</font>

05:37.960 --> 05:39.959
Alexandra is still reeling

05:39.960 --> 05:42.959
at Alex's decision at the
re-coupling, he thought he could

05:42.960 --> 05:45.799
style at the T-shirt but he was
wrong.

05:45.800 --> 05:50.959
Can we just drop it now? <font color="#11FF11">Are you all</font>
<font color="#11FF11">right? You seemed really sad.</font>

05:50.960 --> 05:55.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously I am gutted because</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I did end up quite taking a liking</font>

05:55.960 --> 06:00.959
<font color="#FFFF00">to Paul, after the decision</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we came to.</font>

06:00.960 --> 06:02.959
<font color="#FFFF00">So I was a bit shocked</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">by your decision.</font>

06:02.960 --> 06:06.800
<font color="#FFFF00">We haven't really spoken</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for the past couple of days.</font>

06:08.960 --> 06:10.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't really know what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to say, to be honest.</font>

06:10.960 --> 06:12.959
<font color="#11FF11">I felt sad that we haven't</font>
<font color="#11FF11">been speaking.</font>

06:12.960 --> 06:16.959
<font color="#11FF11">I am sorry that you have felt</font>
<font color="#11FF11">so sad the last three days.</font>

06:16.960 --> 06:19.959
<font color="#11FF11">I know you've been getting to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">know Paul and I know you liked him.</font>

06:19.960 --> 06:22.959
<font color="#11FF11">So I'm sorry you feel disappointed.</font>

06:22.960 --> 06:27.479
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know where things can go and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know if we can rekindle</font>

06:27.480 --> 06:30.959
<font color="#11FF11">things, but I feel we had a good</font>
<font color="#11FF11">connection.</font>

06:30.960 --> 06:33.959
<font color="#11FF11">We were getting on well</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and it seems sad that things have</font>

06:33.960 --> 06:37.959
<font color="#11FF11">fallen apart and we are not giving</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it another try.</font>

06:37.960 --> 06:41.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want to talk about it.</font>

06:41.960 --> 06:43.959
<font color="#11FF11">In terms of with me or what</font>
<font color="#11FF11">happened?</font>

06:43.960 --> 06:48.319
<font color="#FFFF00">In general, I don't feel ready</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to talk just yet.</font>

06:48.320 --> 06:51.959
<font color="#11FF11">Shall I leave you alone for a bit?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I'll be okay.</font>

06:51.960 --> 06:55.799
<font color="#FFFF00">I just need to let things settle</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in my mind.</font>

06:55.800 --> 06:58.960
<font color="#11FF11">Cool, I'll chat with you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in a little bit.</font>

07:05.960 --> 07:08.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know how I feel right now.</font>

07:08.960 --> 07:10.959
<font color="#FFFF00">So I definitely just think that is</font>

07:10.960 --> 07:12.959
<font color="#FFFF00">something I need to put a lot of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thought into.</font>

07:12.960 --> 07:17.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm unsure on where our relationship</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has the potential to go.</font>

07:17.960 --> 07:22.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Alex. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> What's going on?</font>

07:22.960 --> 07:27.959
<font color="#11FF11">I think she's just disappointed</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that Paul didn't pick her. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Really?</font>

07:27.960 --> 07:30.959
<font color="#11FF11">Did you notice when she sat down</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with me she was grumpy.</font>

07:30.960 --> 07:34.960
<font color="#11FF11">You couldn't really see.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I think that is what it is.</font>

07:37.480 --> 07:39.959
<font color="#11FF11">I am sad that things spiralled how</font>
<font color="#11FF11">they did</font>

07:39.960 --> 07:42.959
{\an1}<font color="#11FF11">and things broke up, and I genuinely</font>
<font color="#11FF11">meant what I said that I would be</font>

07:42.960 --> 07:44.959
<font color="#11FF11">open to seeing if we could rekindle</font>
<font color="#11FF11">things.</font>

07:44.960 --> 07:46.959
<font color="#11FF11">But I thought you might be a little</font>
<font color="#11FF11">bit...</font>

07:46.960 --> 07:49.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I think, sometimes a girl just needs</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">space</font>

07:49.960 --> 07:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">and in the morning she will feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">better.</font>

07:51.960 --> 07:53.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It has been tough, you did couple</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">up.</font>

07:53.960 --> 07:57.959
<font color="#FFFF00">You were moving forward,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">things happen,</font>

07:57.960 --> 07:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">she's just had a bit of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a shitty night.</font>

07:59.960 --> 08:03.960
<font color="#11FF11">Her head is all over the place</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and she's just upset.</font>

08:09.960 --> 08:16.799
<font color="#00FFFF">You don't have to say anything, but</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm here babes.</font>

08:16.800 --> 08:19.959
<font color="#00FFFF">What did Alex just say?</font>

08:19.960 --> 08:23.479
<font color="#FFFF00">He just asked me how I felt, said I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">seem disappointed.</font>

08:23.480 --> 08:26.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I said yeah, kind of am.</font>

08:26.640 --> 08:29.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I got a bit emotional, said I didn't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">want to talk right now.</font>

08:29.960 --> 08:35.958
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't fake things, I can't force</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">things with people.</font>

08:35.960 --> 08:38.958
<font color="#FFFF00">If the connection is not there, it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is not there, the same as Paul,</font>

08:38.960 --> 08:41.958
<font color="#FFFF00">I hope he has made his decision for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the right reasons.</font>

08:41.960 --> 08:45.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> There is no one else in here</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I would even look at.</font>

08:45.960 --> 08:47.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like the ship with Alex</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has sailed,</font>

08:47.960 --> 08:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't really see that going back</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to how it was.</font>

08:51.960 --> 08:56.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I just feel I have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">mugged myself. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> By doing what?</font>

08:56.960 --> 08:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">By telling someone I like them when</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I've never told them that before.</font>

08:59.960 --> 09:02.959
<font color="#00FFFF">That is mugging yourself off?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you joking me?</font>

09:02.960 --> 09:05.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, saying to someone I would like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to kiss you.</font>

09:07.960 --> 09:11.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I would never say that to anyone.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What have I tried for?</font>

09:12.960 --> 09:15.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know what to tell you</font>

09:15.640 --> 09:21.960
<font color="#00FFFF">because I know that rejection</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is really hard. </font><font color="#11FF11"> She's crying now.</font>

09:25.960 --> 09:29.960
<font color="#11FF11">I don't even know what to think.</font>

09:31.960 --> 09:34.960
<font color="#00FFFF">You are making me feel upset.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Stop it. You're making me cry.</font>

09:38.960 --> 09:41.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I really feel sad for you.</font>

09:41.960 --> 09:43.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Because I really know that you liked</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Paul</font>

09:43.960 --> 09:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and I cannot believe</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm getting this upset for you.</font>

09:50.960 --> 09:53.959
It has been a long and difficult day.
Tell me about it.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.959
Sam and Georgia are left
but we still have two Joshes,

09:56.960 --> 09:59.959
two Lauras, two Alexes and a pair
of Jacks.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.960
It is a voiceover nightmare!
Just get to bed, you lot.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Can I sleep on the side closest to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex, though?</font>

10:12.960 --> 10:14.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Do whatever you want, babe.</font>

10:14.960 --> 10:18.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I just want to make sure</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">she is okay. Little angel.</font>

10:24.160 --> 10:27.959
<font color="#11FF11">Laura is in bed with a hunk.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Stop it!</font>

10:27.960 --> 10:30.479
<font color="#11FF11">Laura is in bed with a hunk.</font>

10:30.480 --> 10:33.959
<font color="#11FF11">Are you going to kiss him?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I already have. </font><font color="#11FF11"> When?</font>

10:33.960 --> 10:38.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Was it on the lips, though?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you kidding?</font>

10:39.960 --> 10:42.160
<font color="#FFFF00">You better move up right now.</font>

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Josh, get to bed!

11:20.960 --> 11:25.319
Coming up, the challenge is a piece
of cake.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I know what you do in your spare</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">time.</font> (LAUGHTER)

11:39.000 --> 11:41.160
It is the morning after the
coupling.

12:05.960 --> 12:11.959
I feel yesterday was a mad day so
I'm hoping today is more happy for

12:11.960 --> 12:16.959
me, really. <font color="#00FFFF">Are you going to try to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">get to know Josh in that way again?</font>

12:16.960 --> 12:21.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I will definitely try, it's only</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fair if I am coupled with him to</font>

12:21.960 --> 12:27.959
{\an3}<font color="#FFFF00">give it a chance. But obviously, you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">start with your focus on two people</font>

12:27.960 --> 12:33.959
<font color="#FFFF00">and within the same day they become</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">ruled out, so it is difficult,</font>

12:33.960 --> 12:35.959
<font color="#FFFF00">really, I am going to have to do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">another 180 now.</font>

12:35.960 --> 12:41.319
<font color="#FFFF00">He is so far from what I've gone for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in a guy before, in terms of looks.</font>

12:41.320 --> 12:44.959
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not going to sit there and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">pretend he's my type when he isn't,</font>

12:44.960 --> 12:52.319
<font color="#FFFF00">because he isn't. But I'm over</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the whole stereotype of types,</font>

12:52.320 --> 12:56.959
<font color="#FFFF00">really. That is just initial</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">attraction. My mind is very much</font>

12:56.960 --> 12:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">open at this point, so who knows.</font>

12:59.960 --> 13:05.959
<font color="#00FFFF">How was your first night with Paul?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">He's really sweet because he's</font>

13:05.960 --> 13:14.320
<font color="#11FF11">really huggy. All night. He didn't</font>
<font color="#11FF11">let me go.</font>

13:21.960 --> 13:23.959
<font color="#11FF11">Even like, with your feet</font>

13:23.960 --> 13:27.959
<font color="#11FF11">and everything, constantly touching,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it's really nice. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I love that.</font>

13:27.960 --> 13:35.959
<font color="#11FF11">I feel fabulous, with Paul in my</font>
<font color="#11FF11">bed. (LAUGHTER)</font>

13:35.960 --> 13:40.959
<font color="#11FF11">Paul is very affectionate, and that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">is what you want. You just want</font>

13:40.960 --> 13:46.960
<font color="#11FF11">someone to want to be all over you.</font>

13:52.000 --> 13:56.479
<font color="#11FF11">Stephanie say she is not sure what</font>
<font color="#11FF11">she sees in Josh but what he sees in</font>

13:56.480 --> 13:59.960
<font color="#11FF11">Stephanie is a reflection of his</font>
<font color="#11FF11">face on her sunglasses.</font>

14:04.960 --> 14:11.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Thank you. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I think you're gorgeous,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it's mad.</font>

14:11.960 --> 14:15.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like when I am coupled up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with someone, I will give that</font>

14:15.960 --> 14:19.959
<font color="#FFFF00">person 100%, until they give me a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">reason not to. You know?</font>

14:19.960 --> 14:21.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, that's only fair.</font>

14:21.960 --> 14:24.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And obviously the initial attraction</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is there.</font>

14:27.960 --> 14:35.960
<font color="#FFFF00">We know a lot about each other. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yes</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we do. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I'm excited. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> We shall see.</font>

14:36.960 --> 14:38.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I think there can be a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">romantic connection between me and</font>

14:39.000 --> 14:46.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Steph. I will see how it goes today,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if we do get on.</font>

14:46.960 --> 14:47.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The next few days will tell.</font>

14:47.961 --> 14:52.959
Alex is trying to make up with
Alexandra. I promise he's changed!

14:52.960 --> 14:56.959
Out of that grotesque T-shirt, and
he's never wearing it again.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.959
<font color="#11FF11">How are you feeling after last</font>
<font color="#11FF11">night? You were upset.</font>

15:00.960 --> 15:04.959
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">I did feel a bit gutted, about</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">everything. I needed to take a step</font>

15:04.960 --> 15:11.959
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">back from things, I talked to Paul,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and invested sometime into that.</font>

15:11.960 --> 15:18.959
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">It was another little sting. It was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like, okay. It was a bit shit to</font>

15:18.960 --> 15:24.959
<font color="#FFFF00">be honest. Just when you came to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">talk to me straight after,</font>

15:24.960 --> 15:27.959
<font color="#FFFF00">it was just too soon. </font><font color="#11FF11"> You needed to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have space.</font>

15:27.960 --> 15:31.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I was a bit upset they slept on the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couch but I do also think it was the</font>

15:31.960 --> 15:35.959
<font color="#FFFF00">best idea. </font><font color="#11FF11"> We did have a connection,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">things were good before and I don't</font>

15:35.960 --> 15:42.959
{\an1}<font color="#11FF11">know what happened. It went downhill</font>
<font color="#11FF11">from there. Sometimes it's just a</font>

15:42.960 --> 15:49.959
<font color="#11FF11">bit of a shame, so I felt like maybe</font>
<font color="#11FF11">we should start again, not pick up</font>

15:49.960 --> 15:52.959
<font color="#11FF11">from where we were, but spend a bit</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of time together and see how we</font>

15:52.960 --> 15:58.999
<font color="#11FF11">feel. Do you think that's a good</font>
<font color="#11FF11">idea? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I did like him in the</font>

15:59.000 --> 16:04.959
<font color="#FFFF00">beginning. There was a spark there.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think the past couple of days have</font>

16:04.960 --> 16:10.959
<font color="#FFFF00">numbed my emotions and how I felt.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's nice to have my little Alex</font>

16:10.960 --> 16:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">back and hopefully we can move in a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">good direction.</font>

16:13.960 --> 16:19.479
<font color="#11FF11">I wasn't really sure what you think</font>
<font color="#11FF11">about it. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I'm happy to come with an</font>

16:19.480 --> 16:28.160
<font color="#FFFF00">open heart and open mind and just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">refresh, I guess. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Reset. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yes.</font>

16:31.960 --> 16:33.999
The islanders are discussing the
world beyond the villa,

16:34.000 --> 16:38.959
the mysterious creatures lurking out
there. Aliens.

16:38.960 --> 16:44.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Seriously, I do think there are</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">aliens out there. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> 100% there are.</font>

16:44.160 --> 16:49.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Think about it, the universe is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">endless, the concept of end and</font>

16:49.800 --> 16:52.959
<font color="#FFFF00">beginning is human made,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">essentially.</font>

16:52.960 --> 16:56.959
<font color="#FFFF00">There are probably some fit aliens.</font>

16:56.960 --> 17:00.480
There is probably another Love
Island out there.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I got a text!</font>

17:25.960 --> 17:29.159
<font color="#11FF11">Sick! I love a bit of baking.</font>

17:29.160 --> 17:37.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Bake off... b-b-b-bake off...</font>

17:39.960 --> 17:42.959
{\an1}If you want to download his song to
listen to it again you need to sort

17:42.960 --> 17:52.959
your life out. The next task is
called master bakers. The couples

17:52.960 --> 17:56.959
have to make the perfect cake. Mary
Berry already text me to say if

17:56.960 --> 18:01.959
make any bake off puns she will come
and kick my head in.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.959
The boys will be blindfolded and
attached to their female partners.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.000
<font color="#00FFFF">Blindfolded and tied</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to a fit bird.</font>

18:11.960 --> 18:15.960
<font color="#00FFFF">The boys will do the handiwork using</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the guidance of the girls.</font>

18:22.960 --> 18:24.960
First up, the couples have to whip
the cream.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Do it harder!</font>

18:30.960 --> 18:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Faster, beat it faster! </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I am doing</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it!</font>

18:40.960 --> 18:44.960
<font color="#11FF11">Good wrist action there. I know what</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you do in your spare time.</font>

18:51.000 --> 18:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I am very good at that. Wasn't I?</font>

19:00.960 --> 19:03.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You didn't get enough air in it,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I kept telling you,</font>

19:03.960 --> 19:05.960
<font color="#00FFFF">you are just mixing it around the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bowl.</font>

19:08.960 --> 19:11.960
<font color="#11FF11">The walking over, I felt like I had</font>
<font color="#11FF11">shat myself.</font>

19:14.960 --> 19:18.960
<font color="#11FF11">I didn't know what was happening, I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">was going like that. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> The best bit!</font>

19:24.960 --> 19:27.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't drop it!</font>

19:27.960 --> 19:29.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You are going to drop the cream.</font>

19:29.960 --> 19:33.959
It's difficult, when you are
blindfolded or your other senses are

19:33.960 --> 19:35.960
heightened massively.

19:47.960 --> 19:55.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Push it to the north-east. Spread</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it, that's good.</font>

19:55.960 --> 19:57.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That's going really well.</font>

19:58.960 --> 20:05.640
<font color="#11FF11">Use the hands to smooth the cream.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Like Patrick Swayze.</font>

20:09.960 --> 20:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">This is good.</font>

20:13.960 --> 20:17.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Great accuracy. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Timing. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> All of that.</font>

20:17.960 --> 20:21.960
It is time to decorate those cakes.

20:38.800 --> 20:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I think we did really well</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">as a team. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I got a bit distracted.</font>

20:52.960 --> 20:54.960
<font color="#11FF11">Sorry, Jack, I thought it was the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">cake.</font>

20:57.480 --> 21:01.959
<font color="#FFFF00">One little blob. I carried you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">through it, didn't I?</font>

21:01.960 --> 21:03.960
<font color="#00FFFF">No, I carried you. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Are you joking?</font>

21:07.960 --> 21:14.960
{\an1}<font color="#11FF11">With your right hand, go north-east.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Smooth it over so it feels good.</font>

21:15.960 --> 21:18.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Use blue. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> What is blue! I can't see</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anything!</font>

21:24.960 --> 21:27.999
<font color="#11FF11">We really enjoyed being tied</font>
<font color="#11FF11">together.</font>

21:28.000 --> 21:30.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, your bum is quite... umm...</font>

21:38.960 --> 21:45.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Slowly, slowly. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> We are precision</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">engineers,</font>

21:45.960 --> 21:48.800
<font color="#00FFFF">I am not about throwing stuff</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">around.</font>

21:54.960 --> 21:57.999
<font color="#11FF11">I have no idea what I was saying. I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">just thought his arms were mine</font>

21:58.000 --> 22:01.999
<font color="#11FF11">and I was wondering why my arms</font>
<font color="#11FF11">weren't moving.</font>

22:02.000 --> 22:04.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh!</font>

22:04.960 --> 22:06.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Did it come out? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You are messing up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the cake.</font>

22:18.960 --> 22:25.320
<font color="#11FF11">Left, left. Back towards me. Down.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yes.</font>

22:28.960 --> 22:30.960
(KLAXON)

22:43.960 --> 22:48.959
Time is up, and don't those cakes
look lovely?

22:48.960 --> 22:51.960
Sorry, I said that wrong, they don't
look lovely.

22:58.960 --> 23:06.959
<font color="#11FF11">And the winner of Master Bakers Love</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Island 2018 is Laura and Jack!</font>

23:06.960 --> 23:09.959
(CHEERING)

23:09.960 --> 23:15.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Winners! Champion.</font>

23:20.960 --> 23:24.959
Well done, you two. But I think all
our bakers rose to the occasion.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.960
Mary, it was a mistake! Put the
knuckle duster away.

23:29.960 --> 23:34.320
Coming up, life is a beach for Jack
and Laura.

23:35.320 --> 23:39.160
<font color="#00FFFF">What does that mean? </font><font color="#11FF11"> You are hot.</font>

23:46.960 --> 23:48.959
Jack and Laura won the baking
challenge.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.959
I just tasted the cake and I would
say

23:50.960 --> 23:55.479
I dispute the result, and leave it at
that. But what is the prize?

23:55.480 --> 23:57.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I got a text.</font>

24:12.960 --> 24:14.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Have a good one, mate.</font>

24:17.960 --> 24:21.959
<font color="#11FF11">We are about to go on a first date</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I'm so excited.</font>

24:21.960 --> 24:22.960
<font color="#11FF11">Just to go and do something,</font>

24:22.961 --> 24:25.159
<font color="#11FF11">one-on-one with Jack is going to be</font>
<font color="#11FF11">so nice.</font>

24:25.160 --> 24:27.319
<font color="#11FF11">I'm just excited to spend some time</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with him,</font>

24:27.320 --> 24:31.959
<font color="#11FF11">outside the villa, alone. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> She from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Devon?</font>

24:31.960 --> 24:36.960
<font color="#00FFFF">She, is from Devon. She, is from</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Devon.</font>

24:40.960 --> 24:45.959
<font color="#00FFFF">She is a surfer.</font>

24:45.960 --> 24:49.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Her mum, gave birth to her.</font>

24:49.160 --> 24:52.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I am a little bit nervous, to be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">honest with you, about the date.</font>

24:52.480 --> 24:55.319
<font color="#00FFFF">The reason is because it is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the first date where I have really</font>

24:55.320 --> 24:59.159
<font color="#00FFFF">had with a girl in here that I care</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about.</font>

24:59.160 --> 25:02.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I've been on two previous dates.</font>

25:02.960 --> 25:04.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I was selected, it was not my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">choice.</font>

25:04.960 --> 25:07.959
{\an1}<font color="#00FFFF">They were nice dates, but this is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the date that means the most to me.</font>

25:07.960 --> 25:11.479
<font color="#00FFFF">You look amazing. </font><font color="#11FF11"> So do you.</font>

25:11.480 --> 25:14.959
When it comes down to it, Jack is
most definitely a tit man.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.959
He just prefers them to sparrows and
starlings.

25:17.960 --> 25:22.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack, are you watching the birds</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">again? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yes. Unbelievable.</font>

25:22.960 --> 25:25.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It wasn't even a swallow.</font>

25:25.960 --> 25:27.999
<font color="#00FFFF">It was just going up</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and down, it was chasing a moth.</font>

25:28.000 --> 25:31.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you know what they are? Do you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">know what a swallow is or a swift?</font>

25:31.960 --> 25:33.959
<font color="#00FFFF">They are migratory birds.</font>

25:33.960 --> 25:39.959
<font color="#00FFFF">They actually come from Africa. And</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">they fly over here. That's one.</font>

25:39.960 --> 25:46.959
<font color="#00FFFF">That's a swallow there. That is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">swift. They are amazing.</font>

25:46.960 --> 25:49.959
<font color="#00FFFF">They are one of the fastest birds</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on earth,</font>

25:49.960 --> 25:51.999
<font color="#00FFFF">and what they do is they get the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bugs are stranded on water.</font>

25:52.000 --> 25:55.959
<font color="#00FFFF">They pick 'em off the top. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really love this. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I do.</font>

25:55.960 --> 25:58.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I could do this for hours. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">actually really peaceful.</font>

25:58.960 --> 26:00.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like I should start doing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this.</font>

26:00.960 --> 26:03.959
<font color="#00FFFF">There you are. A little sparrow was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">having a drink. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Aww.</font>

26:03.960 --> 26:08.959
<font color="#00FFFF">That's gone now. Mate, I promise you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">this is a little nature haven.</font>

26:08.960 --> 26:10.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I love nature.</font>

26:12.960 --> 26:16.959
# I was born a water baby #

26:16.960 --> 26:18.959
Jack and Laura are at the beach.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.959
I bet surfer Laura wishes he was out
there

26:21.960 --> 26:23.959
on her board now with it all going
off.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.959
Slotting a barrel, avoiding the
groms and kooks

26:26.960 --> 26:29.319
and hoping she doesn't get skunked.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.959
I am literally just reading
words off Google.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I did not have you down as a picnic</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">basket sort of guy.</font>

26:35.960 --> 26:38.959
<font color="#00FFFF">There is a lot about me you don't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you know. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, is there?</font>

26:38.960 --> 26:43.799
<font color="#00FFFF">That's why it's good to be going on</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a date with you.</font>

26:43.800 --> 26:47.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I was trying to work out what accent</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you have.</font>

26:47.160 --> 26:52.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know, I think it's got bits</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from everywhere. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Oh really? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yes.</font>

26:52.640 --> 26:56.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I travelled with four other girls.</font>

26:56.960 --> 27:00.639
<font color="#FFFF00">It was me and to Australian girls</font>

27:00.640 --> 27:02.959
<font color="#FFFF00">and one American and a Hawaiian</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">girl.</font>

27:02.960 --> 27:08.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And then I was living in France, it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was kind of weird.</font>

27:09.960 --> 27:11.959
<font color="#FFFF00">What about your accent?</font>

27:11.960 --> 27:17.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I am actually half English</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and half St Helenian.</font>

27:17.960 --> 27:20.959
<font color="#00FFFF">That face is what everyone pulls.</font>

27:20.960 --> 27:22.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It is one of the most remote islands</font>

27:22.960 --> 27:26.639
<font color="#00FFFF">in the world in between South Africa</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and South America.</font>

27:26.640 --> 27:29.959
<font color="#00FFFF">So that is a bit of a twang there.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I was raised in East London.</font>

27:29.960 --> 27:32.959
<font color="#00FFFF">People get thrown by my accent.</font>

27:32.960 --> 27:36.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You have spent a lot of time in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Portugal.</font>

27:36.960 --> 27:38.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I lived there for a year.</font>

27:38.960 --> 27:43.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Then I was living in Australia for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like a few months and then Bali for</font>

27:43.960 --> 27:47.639
<font color="#FFFF00">almost 2 years and then I was just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">too far away from mum and dad.</font>

27:47.640 --> 27:49.799
<font color="#FFFF00">So when I had the opportunity to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">come back</font>

27:49.800 --> 27:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">to Europe, Portugal was the place</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I wanted</font>

27:51.960 --> 27:54.959
<font color="#FFFF00">to go back to. So I had a house</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">there for the last few years.</font>

27:54.960 --> 27:56.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I love being there, like it's an</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">amazing place</font>

27:56.960 --> 27:59.319
<font color="#FFFF00">and am happy to spend as much time</font>

27:59.320 --> 28:02.999
<font color="#FFFF00">as I can there but I think I as time</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has gone on I realised that the</font>

28:03.000 --> 28:05.959
<font color="#FFFF00">things I want to do, I need to be in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">London a bit more.</font>

28:05.960 --> 28:07.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Then you'll go back to Portugal on</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the weekend?</font>

28:07.960 --> 28:12.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Monday to Friday London,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">weekends Portugal.</font>

28:12.480 --> 28:15.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I've never been to Portugal. I've</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">been to Spain.</font>

28:15.800 --> 28:20.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I will show you around my town.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes? I would like that.</font>

28:20.480 --> 28:23.959
<font color="#00FFFF">If you have got Portuguese I would</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like to know.</font>

28:23.960 --> 28:25.960
<font color="#FFFF00">(SPEAKS PORTUGUESE)</font>

28:30.480 --> 28:33.960
<font color="#00FFFF">What is it mean? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You are like hot.</font>

28:40.640 --> 28:50.959
{\an1}<font color="#00FFFF">It is weird that I surf as well. It</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is a bit like fate, a little bit</font>

28:50.960 --> 29:00.959
<font color="#00FFFF">like fate but I'm not complaining. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">started surfing when I was like, 12</font>

29:00.960 --> 29:06.479
<font color="#FFFF00">or 11. I started doing national</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">competitions and became British</font>

29:06.480 --> 29:12.319
<font color="#FFFF00">champion and then European and at</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the world qualifying series then I</font>

29:12.320 --> 29:18.959
<font color="#FFFF00">was just travelling so much, it may</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be quite insecure. One minute I was</font>

29:18.960 --> 29:23.999
<font color="#FFFF00">in one country then another. I have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">no idea what I'm doing and was</font>

29:24.000 --> 29:29.479
<font color="#FFFF00">travelling that much it made it hard</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to have something consistent.</font>

29:29.480 --> 29:36.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Today, I know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it has been the best day I have had.</font>

29:36.960 --> 29:41.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Me too. I think it will stay like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> A long time until we get</font>

29:41.960 --> 29:52.960
<font color="#00FFFF">the next date. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Smooth! </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You think I'm</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">smooth. I got it from my dad.</font>

29:55.960 --> 29:59.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I really enjoyed spending time with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you, especially today. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Our first</font>

29:59.800 --> 30:06.959
<font color="#FFFF00">date. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> And it has not been a bad one.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">The stuff you've done in your life I</font>

30:06.960 --> 30:10.960
<font color="#00FFFF">find it so interesting. I hope to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">know more.</font>

30:20.960 --> 30:22.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Cheers, babe. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Cheers.</font>

30:29.320 --> 30:31.959
Let's see what they're doing back at
the villa.

30:31.960 --> 30:35.960
Oh, Wesley, tau jida, tau jida
indeed.

30:39.960 --> 30:43.959
<font color="#11FF11">How do you think that it is going to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">go? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> They have that crazy spark</font>

30:43.960 --> 30:51.799
<font color="#FFFF00">already. They are almost tailor-made</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for each other. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I wonder what</font>

30:51.800 --> 30:54.960
<font color="#00FFFF">they're doing? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Something romantic</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and cute, obviously.</font>

30:55.960 --> 30:58.959
He's been in that villa nearly two
months,

30:58.960 --> 31:02.959
and finally Jack is about
to get well and truly fact.

31:02.960 --> 31:09.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I give you a fact about anything.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Flamingos. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Flamingos are actually</font>

31:09.960 --> 31:13.999
<font color="#FFFF00">white. It is what they eat that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">makes the feathers pink. That is</font>

31:14.000 --> 31:21.959
<font color="#FFFF00">true. Next. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Jack is just a fact man.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know what he does. I want to</font>

31:21.960 --> 31:26.959
{\an1}<font color="#00FFFF">know what he does in his spare time.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">They are so random. They are in a</font>

31:26.960 --> 31:30.959
<font color="#00FFFF">box and he cannot wait to release</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">them. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Polar bear? Therefore is</font>

31:30.960 --> 31:33.959
<font color="#FFFF00">see-through, it is not white.</font>

31:33.960 --> 31:39.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Ask Attenborough, he would tell you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Ask him and he will tell you.</font>

31:39.960 --> 31:44.160
<font color="#FFFF00">Me super intelligent? I think I am.</font>

31:46.960 --> 31:48.960
<font color="#00FFFF">They're back.</font>

31:51.320 --> 32:00.639
<font color="#00FFFF">You lot all look really nice. The</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">date was very, very romantic. I did</font>

32:00.640 --> 32:04.959
<font color="#00FFFF">not know she existed five days ago.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That has put it all in perspective.</font>

32:04.960 --> 32:12.959
<font color="#00FFFF">At the moment she is ticking all the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">boxes. We had a little drink.</font>

32:12.960 --> 32:21.960
<font color="#FFFF00">A little beach picnic. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It was so</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">nice. </font><font color="#11FF11"> No surfing? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No surfing.</font>

32:24.960 --> 32:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack was being extremely smooth.</font>

32:31.960 --> 32:35.640
<font color="#00FFFF">I was giving a smoulder. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Do it</font>
<font color="#11FF11">again.</font>

32:41.960 --> 32:46.959
<font color="#11FF11">I just know you were doing that the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">whole time. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I gave it a triangle.</font>

32:46.960 --> 32:55.999
<font color="#11FF11">She was giddy. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It was a lot. </font><font color="#11FF11"> It has</font>
<font color="#11FF11">worked. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yes it has.</font>

32:56.000 --> 32:58.959
<font color="#FFFF00">We left there all smouldered out.</font>

32:58.960 --> 33:03.959
Still to come... Oops Paul's did it
again.

33:03.960 --> 33:06.960
<font color="#11FF11">As you trying to tell me that you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have snogged Britney Spears?</font>

33:18.960 --> 33:21.959
Laura and Kaz are talking to
Alexandra about Alex.

33:21.960 --> 33:25.959
The chat only rates .4 on the Love
Island emotional scale so Alexandra

33:25.960 --> 33:28.959
won't require the all-new extra
strong confession cushion.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It is what it is. Alex and I have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">spoken this morning and cleared</font>

33:31.960 --> 33:36.959
<font color="#FFFF00">air. In the past couple of days it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has made me realised how</font>

33:36.960 --> 33:42.959
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">romantically interested am I that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I am willing to open my heart up and</font>

33:42.960 --> 33:48.639
<font color="#FFFF00">to see how the next couple of days</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">goes. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You do not know how you feel.</font>

33:48.640 --> 33:52.159
<font color="#FFFF00">The one thing that is bugging me is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that you and Paul have just coupled</font>

33:52.160 --> 33:57.959
<font color="#FFFF00">up, I'm so happy for you you spend a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">lot of time together today. You are</font>

33:57.960 --> 34:02.479
<font color="#FFFF00">attentive to what one another. Alex</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I are just friends. He has not</font>

34:02.480 --> 34:08.958
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">always been so tactile. When I first</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">met him he open himself up a lot.</font>

34:08.960 --> 34:12.958
<font color="#FFFF00">The last couple of days he close</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">himself off a bit and so did I.</font>

34:12.960 --> 34:19.159
<font color="#11FF11">Do you think you will have to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">start initiating stuff? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Maybe. I'm</font>

34:19.159 --> 34:24.958
<font color="#FFFF00">not that type of girl. I hope that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he has the courage to do something.</font>

34:24.960 --> 34:30.958
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">It is so nice to see you and Paul.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You are tactile with each other.</font>

34:30.960 --> 34:40.320
<font color="#00FFFF">We have not had a snog. I don't want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be all over him. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Don't lie.</font>

34:48.960 --> 34:50.958
Dani and Jack think a bit of role

34:50.960 --> 34:54.159
play is the perfect idea for Alex to
spice up his relationship with

34:54.159 --> 34:58.159
Alexandra, and with him being a
doctor, it has to be...

34:58.160 --> 34:59.959
the film Four Christmases.

34:59.960 --> 35:04.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Have you seen the film? That Four</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Christmases film. With Reese</font>

35:04.800 --> 35:10.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Witherspoon. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> She is fit. You ain't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">gonna pull Reese Witherspoon.</font>

35:14.960 --> 35:18.959
<font color="#FFFF00">They are flirting and they don't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">know each other. That is the</font>

35:18.960 --> 35:26.959
<font color="#FFFF00">beginning. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Get him to go as if they</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">don't know each other and start from</font>

35:26.960 --> 35:34.959
<font color="#00FFFF">the beginning. They know they know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">each other. He is Hugh Grant.</font>

35:34.960 --> 35:38.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Call him over. Alex. I want to talk</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to you.</font>

35:38.960 --> 35:43.480
<font color="#00FFFF">Come and play with me. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Here he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">comes.</font>

35:45.960 --> 35:48.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We have had an idea. We've had a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really good idea.</font>

35:48.960 --> 35:56.960
<font color="#11FF11">I am not stripping again. What is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">going on?</font>

35:58.160 --> 36:02.959
{\an1}<font color="#00FFFF">You and Alexandra you've had some</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">teething problems. You have to start</font>

36:02.960 --> 36:06.959
<font color="#00FFFF">again. What you need to do. It is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">role-playing and it's going to be</font>

36:06.960 --> 36:13.319
<font color="#00FFFF">sexy. You are going to be the new</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">confident you. Go up to and pretend</font>

36:13.320 --> 36:16.960
<font color="#00FFFF">you don't know her. She's in a bar.</font>

36:25.960 --> 36:29.640
<font color="#11FF11">But she knows who I am. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> This is the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">point. You're starting again.</font>

36:34.960 --> 36:37.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Make her laugh some more.</font>

36:37.960 --> 36:47.479
<font color="#11FF11">What are you like? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Pull your jeans</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">up. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I've done stripping,</font>

36:47.480 --> 36:51.959

<font color="#11FF11">of things in this villa.</font>

36:51.960 --> 36:53.959
<font color="#11FF11">You know I might as well do this</font>
<font color="#11FF11">role play.</font>

36:53.960 --> 37:04.959
<font color="#11FF11">Alex. Come with me. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> She put her arm</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">around him. If she didn't like she</font>

37:04.960 --> 37:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">wouldn't do that. </font><font color="#11FF11"> What we are to do</font>
<font color="#11FF11">is a bit of role-play. You are at a</font>

37:13.960 --> 37:20.959
<font color="#11FF11">bar. We just to see how things go.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">How does that sound?</font>

37:20.960 --> 37:22.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It sounds like our first date again.</font>

37:30.960 --> 37:33.959
<font color="#11FF11">I'm just at the bar.</font>

38:03.960 --> 38:07.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I have been waiting for a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">doctor to turn up. I have a bruise</font>

38:07.960 --> 38:09.960
<font color="#FFFF00">on the back of my legs which needs</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">attention.</font>

38:15.960 --> 38:19.960
{\an1}<font color="#11FF11">I have heard you have a broken heart</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I wanted to come and fix it.</font>

38:22.960 --> 38:28.959
<font color="#11FF11">What do you do? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I paint people's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">faces. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Could you make me look</font>

38:28.960 --> 38:32.959
<font color="#11FF11">pretty. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You already are.</font>

38:32.960 --> 38:44.959
<font color="#11FF11">I appreciate that. Keep going. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> This</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is sick. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I'm gonna cry.</font>

38:44.960 --> 38:48.959
<font color="#11FF11">I am actually a stripper in my</font>
<font color="#11FF11">spare time. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Would you strip for me</font>

38:48.960 --> 38:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">later. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Why not? Take it from there.</font>

39:03.960 --> 39:05.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That could not have worked any</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">better.</font>

39:34.480 --> 39:37.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you to Jack and Dani for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">encouraging him to do that. I'm not</font>

39:37.960 --> 39:41.800
<font color="#FFFF00">sure I'd be feeling the way I feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">now if that had not happened.</font>

39:44.640 --> 39:47.959
My agent must be a fan of Four
Christmases, cos whenever I call

39:47.960 --> 39:49.960
him he pretends to have no idea who
I am.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.959
So the islanders area all heading
for bed,

39:54.960 --> 39:57.960
well, except for Paul and Laura.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.960
<font color="#FFFF00">This is moist.</font>

40:08.960 --> 40:13.320
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel bad that I like that word.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It is awkward.</font>

40:20.480 --> 40:22.959
It's late, they're all alone

40:22.960 --> 40:25.959
and all Paul can think about is
snogging a beautiful blonde...

40:25.960 --> 40:29.959
and he cannot wait to tell Laura all
about it.

40:29.960 --> 40:35.479
<font color="#00FFFF">When I was in LA, one of the first</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">jobs I did was do you fancy doing a</font>

40:35.480 --> 40:41.479
<font color="#00FFFF">music video and they said it was for</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Britney Spears. And I said oh yeah,</font>

40:41.480 --> 40:51.639
<font color="#00FFFF">why not? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Was she single at the time?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">In the video I got pulled by her and</font>

40:51.640 --> 40:57.959
<font color="#00FFFF">she chose me to be the lead guy. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you trying to tell me that you have</font>

40:57.960 --> 41:05.959
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">snogged Britney Spears? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, in the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">video. It is in the video. It got</font>

41:05.960 --> 41:11.959
<font color="#00FFFF">quite steamy in the video. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> What do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you mean? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> We were doing a casting</font>

41:11.960 --> 41:16.959
<font color="#00FFFF">video and I'm reading the script and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she comes in and threw the papers</font>

41:16.960 --> 41:20.959
<font color="#00FFFF">and I pull her in and we kissed and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">walked off and there is a bit when</font>

41:20.960 --> 41:22.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm on top of her in the bed.</font>

41:25.480 --> 41:29.000
<font color="#00FFFF">It is a music video, you can only go</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">as far as that.</font>

41:32.000 --> 41:41.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you wanted to go further? Do you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fancy Britney Spears? She fit? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah,</font>

41:41.960 --> 41:47.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Britney is hot. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> How old is she?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I think she's 36.</font>

41:47.960 --> 41:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">She is 40. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> She is not. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I'm 29.</font>

41:59.960 --> 42:08.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not with her. It was a music</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">video. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> That is so funny.</font>

42:10.960 --> 42:16.960
<font color="#FFFF00">What was the song? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Make Me. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Can you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">sing it? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No.</font>

42:18.960 --> 42:22.960
Go on Paul, Britney'll start us off,
then you join in.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Shall we just sleep outside?</font>

42:54.960 --> 42:58.000
<font color="#00FFFF">Do I look cool? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No.</font>

43:18.160 --> 43:25.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Thanks and good night.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">How quiet is it?</font>

43:25.960 --> 43:28.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The fire pit where all the drama is.</font>

43:51.960 --> 43:53.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I was going to do it on there</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but I was sinking.</font>
