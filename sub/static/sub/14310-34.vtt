00:01.000 --> 00:03.140
[instrumental music]

00:05.089 --> 00:08.099
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.119 --> 00:12.070
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.089 --> 00:14.220
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.230
They were good.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.170
[theme music]

00:22.109 --> 00:26.089
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.050
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.140 --> 00:34.020
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.039 --> 00:36.140
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:36.159 --> 00:38.140
[evil laughter]

00:38.159 --> 00:39.149
Unh!

00:39.170 --> 00:41.100
Oh, I'll get you!

00:41.119 --> 00:44.149
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.

00:44.170 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:47.049 --> 00:51.070
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.200
And if you're good,
you may just

00:53.219 --> 00:56.210
catch a glimpse
of the Smurfs.

00:59.049 --> 01:01.149
[theme music]

01:03.159 --> 01:06.120
[pleasant music]

01:12.210 --> 01:14.030
[snoring]

01:19.090 --> 01:21.079
Huh? What?
Who? What?

01:21.099 --> 01:24.030
Oh, watch where
you're smurfing, Clumsy.

01:24.049 --> 01:28.030
- Sorry, Lazy. I-I didn't--
- Look out!

01:30.060 --> 01:32.229
You nearly wrecked my new
smurfberry picking machine!

01:33.009 --> 01:36.159
Oh, but, Handy,
Lazy was asleep and-and I--

01:36.180 --> 01:40.069
Sleep? Who can get any sleep
with you around?

01:42.049 --> 01:43.120
But I, uh..

01:47.180 --> 01:50.090
Hi, Greedy.
I got a present for you.

01:50.109 --> 01:53.099
- For me, Jokey?
- It's a surprise.

01:54.189 --> 01:56.000
[snickering]

01:56.020 --> 01:57.150
Hi, Brainy!

01:57.170 --> 02:00.099
Papa Smurf wouldn't
like this, Jokey Smurf.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.219
'I'm Papa Smurf's assistant
and Papa Smurf says..'

02:04.000 --> 02:05.159
[explosion]

02:05.180 --> 02:09.210
Not funny. Not funny!
I'm gonna tell Papa Smurf.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.120
Oops!

02:11.139 --> 02:13.159
What are you doing, Clumsy?

02:13.180 --> 02:16.210
- Well, I-I-I, uh--
- 'Never mind.'

02:16.229 --> 02:19.150
I have important business
with Papa Smurf.

02:19.170 --> 02:24.020
Uh, but, gee, Brainy,
I-I didn't...mean to.

02:25.060 --> 02:27.170
[muttering]

02:27.189 --> 02:29.079
Unh!

02:29.099 --> 02:31.180
I hate clumsy Smurfs!

02:31.199 --> 02:35.030
Oh, but honest, Grouchy,
I've been, uh..

02:35.050 --> 02:37.060
Oh, never mind.

02:38.110 --> 02:41.000
Oh, no Smurf likes me anymore.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.120
[sighs, glass shatters]

02:43.139 --> 02:45.210
(Papa Smurf)
'And a half smurf
of burnt sienna'

02:45.229 --> 02:47.219
'three smurfs
of sarsaparilla leaves.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.139
Ah, that about does it.

02:49.159 --> 02:52.020
Now, to see
if the experiment smurfs.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.180
[boom]

02:53.199 --> 02:54.229
Wow!

02:57.170 --> 03:01.189
It works! I finally smurfed
spontaneous germination.

03:01.210 --> 03:03.219
I have flower power!

03:04.000 --> 03:06.189
Boy, I bet if I was a wizard

03:06.210 --> 03:09.020
all the other Smurfs
would like me.

03:09.039 --> 03:13.030
Yup, that's it.
I'll be just like Papa Smurf.

03:14.180 --> 03:16.009
Uh, let's see.

03:16.030 --> 03:20.020
Papa Smurf used burnt sienna,
smurfic acid.

03:20.039 --> 03:22.159
Now, I heat it all up and..

03:22.180 --> 03:23.210
[boom]

03:25.199 --> 03:30.030
Gee, must have
gone wrong somewhere.

03:30.050 --> 03:34.150
Uh, of course, Papa Smurf's been
at this magic stuff for years.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.229
Oh, maybe I need experience.

03:39.079 --> 03:43.009
Yoo-hoo, Papa Smurf,
where are ya?

03:43.030 --> 03:45.189
Oh. Ha-ha.
There you are, Papa Smurf.

03:45.210 --> 03:48.079
[sighs]
What is it, Clumsy?

03:48.099 --> 03:51.060
Oh, I'd like to be
your assistant, Papa Smurf.

03:51.079 --> 03:53.229
'I have a real gift
for smurfing magic and--'

03:54.009 --> 03:57.050
I'm sorry, Clumsy,
Brainy is my assistant

03:57.069 --> 03:59.050
and he's more than enough.

03:59.069 --> 04:01.229
Uh, okay, Papa Smurf.

04:03.129 --> 04:06.080
But I wanna
smurf magic right now.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.110
Uh, yup. Papa Smurf's
still in the forest.

04:10.129 --> 04:13.069
Now's the time to smurf
a look at his magic book.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.040
Oh, nuts!

04:20.079 --> 04:21.199
I'll get in another way.

04:23.060 --> 04:26.110
Papa Smurf's gone.
So here goes nothing.

04:26.129 --> 04:28.160
Aah!

04:28.180 --> 04:29.209
[thump]

04:31.019 --> 04:33.069
Now, to find
the book of magic spells.

04:35.069 --> 04:39.180
- Clumsy!
- Oh, uh. Ha-ha. Hi, Papa Smurf.

04:42.060 --> 04:44.079
What are you smurfing in here?

04:44.100 --> 04:46.100
[stammering]

04:46.120 --> 04:49.139
I came to clean
your laboratory, Papa Smurf.

04:49.159 --> 04:52.170
Why, that's a very
good idea, Clumsy.

05:03.209 --> 05:05.139
I hate joggers!

05:11.139 --> 05:13.149
[dramatic music]

05:13.170 --> 05:17.079
(Gargamel)
'Come, Azrael. Let us
draw some water from the pond.'

05:17.100 --> 05:20.019
The scum should be
nice and thick now.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.100
[mewing]

05:27.120 --> 05:29.009
[grunting]

05:29.029 --> 05:31.000
Oof!

05:31.019 --> 05:33.170
I'll never smurf this book
back to the village.

05:33.189 --> 05:35.069
(Gargamel)
'Come along, Azrael.'

05:35.090 --> 05:36.139
[Azrael mewing]

05:36.159 --> 05:38.050
[gasps]
Gargamel.

05:38.069 --> 05:39.170
Wait, Azrael.

05:39.189 --> 05:40.220
[sniffing]

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I smell happiness.

05:43.019 --> 05:45.050
Little blue happiness.

05:45.069 --> 05:47.180
I smell Smurfs.

05:47.199 --> 05:48.220
[sniffing]

05:49.000 --> 05:50.139
[mewing]

05:52.040 --> 05:55.050
One page is better that none.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.160
What's my book of spells
doing there?

06:03.180 --> 06:06.000
[mewing]

06:06.019 --> 06:10.029
I knew I smelt the rotten,
revolting, wile, little Smurf.

06:10.050 --> 06:13.170
Azrael, one of them
has torn out a page.

06:13.189 --> 06:15.139
[evil laugh]

06:15.160 --> 06:20.069
But when they try that spell,
they're in for a big surprise.

06:20.089 --> 06:22.050
[Gargamel laughs]

06:22.069 --> 06:23.129
[laughs]

06:25.000 --> 06:28.069
(Clumsy)
'Uh, let's see. One sap
of stinging needles..'

06:28.089 --> 06:32.009
...a smurf of quicklime
and a six-week-old egg.

06:32.029 --> 06:34.189
Mix well and smurf
over a low flame.

06:34.209 --> 06:38.090
Uh-ha. Well, I-I wonder
why nothing happened?

06:41.170 --> 06:43.050
Huh?

06:45.029 --> 06:46.230
Aah!

06:47.009 --> 06:50.110
(Brainy)
'A monster!
Smurf for your lives!'

06:50.129 --> 06:52.149
Let's get outta here!

06:52.170 --> 06:55.220
Help! Help!
Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.139
Clumsy! What happened?

06:57.159 --> 07:00.149
Oh, I smurfed a magic potion
from the book of spells

07:00.170 --> 07:02.110
and this is what happened.

07:02.129 --> 07:06.079
- What book of spells?
- Well, uh, uh, Gargamel's.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.199
Gargamel? I've told you
never to go there.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.209
Come along.
I'll see what I can do.

07:17.060 --> 07:19.069
Uh, haven't you
got something else

07:19.089 --> 07:21.129
that might tip
the scales, Papa Smurf?

07:21.149 --> 07:22.220
Try this.

07:25.149 --> 07:27.069
A-a-choo!

07:28.180 --> 07:30.220
We'll have to smurf
something else.

07:32.180 --> 07:34.009
It's no use, Clumsy.

07:34.029 --> 07:36.159
None of my potion
seems to work.

07:36.180 --> 07:40.100
Uh, you mean I'll be this way
for the rest of my

07:40.120 --> 07:42.009
[sniffles]
whole smurf?

07:42.029 --> 07:44.170
No, no, no.
I'll find an anti-smurf.

07:44.189 --> 07:46.079
Go home and I'll call you.

07:50.079 --> 07:51.170
Can I play?

07:51.189 --> 07:54.069
- Yuck!
- I hate monsters!

07:57.050 --> 07:59.040
[sobbing]

07:59.060 --> 08:02.129
Nobody wants to play
with me anymore.

08:02.149 --> 08:06.009
I can't wait for Papa Smurf
to change me back.

08:06.029 --> 08:07.149
I've got to do it myself.

08:07.170 --> 08:10.110
I'll have to tell Clumsy
I haven't been able

08:10.129 --> 08:12.120
to come up with a cure.

08:12.139 --> 08:15.129
"Dear Papa Smurf,
nobody liked me before

08:15.149 --> 08:19.050
"and now that I'm green
and scaly, it's even worse.

08:19.069 --> 08:22.050
"I've gone to Gargamel's
to find the cure.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.220
Love from Clumsy."

08:24.000 --> 08:25.220
Quick, quick!
We must save Clumsy!

08:26.000 --> 08:28.199
- He's going to Gargamel's.
- Gargamel's? Why?

08:28.220 --> 08:31.110
(Papa Smurf)
'For an antidote
to turn back to a smurf.'

08:31.129 --> 08:32.190
I hate Gargamel!

08:32.210 --> 08:34.220
Gee, maybe we hurt
Clumsy's feeling.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.070
Yeah, he wanted to play with us
and we wouldn't let him.

08:38.090 --> 08:40.009
[trumpet blows]

08:40.029 --> 08:42.058
[all clamoring]

08:42.080 --> 08:44.009
(Papa Smurf)
'Let's go, Smurfs!'

08:44.029 --> 08:47.039
[dramatic music]

08:50.029 --> 08:51.100
Huh?

08:51.120 --> 08:56.080
So, here's my loathsome,
little spell stealer, eh?

08:56.100 --> 08:57.080
[laughs]

08:57.100 --> 08:58.179
Talk about ugly.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.120
[laughs]

09:00.139 --> 09:01.159
[snarling]

09:01.179 --> 09:03.149
(Gargamel)
'Azrael, out, out, out!'

09:03.169 --> 09:07.149
That Smurf is not for you,
he's for me.

09:07.169 --> 09:09.000
[grumbling]

09:10.169 --> 09:12.230
(Papa Smurf)
'Leave the Smurf alone,
Gargamel'

09:13.009 --> 09:15.039
or you'll be sorry!

09:15.059 --> 09:17.080
Ah! The Smurfs!

09:17.100 --> 09:20.210
This time, I have
the whole abominable lot of you.

09:23.179 --> 09:26.039
A tad of gum starch,
a bit of glue

09:26.059 --> 09:27.210
some plaster of paris.

09:27.230 --> 09:31.000
- Smurf it, Grouchy!
- Ooh!

09:31.019 --> 09:34.159
I-I'll get you.
I'll get you all!

09:34.179 --> 09:36.000
Now!

09:37.039 --> 09:39.009
Yeow!

09:39.029 --> 09:40.149
Smurf's eye!

09:40.169 --> 09:43.039
You rotten Smurfs!
You can't..

09:43.059 --> 09:47.090
I mean..
I can't...can't move.

09:47.110 --> 09:48.100
It worked!

09:48.120 --> 09:49.190
[Jokey laughs]

09:49.210 --> 09:53.210
- The joke's on Gargamel.
- I hate Gargamel!

09:54.230 --> 09:57.070
Uh, gee. Thanks, Smurfs.

09:57.090 --> 10:00.070
Now, to find a spell
to turn Clumsy back to normal.

10:00.090 --> 10:04.019
Ah! Here it is. Hmm.
All the ingredients are here

10:04.039 --> 10:07.039
except for the three hairs
from a cat's tail.

10:07.059 --> 10:10.179
Smurfs, I need volunteers
to smurf me three hairs

10:10.200 --> 10:12.149
from the tip of a cat's tail.

10:12.169 --> 10:14.029
Azrael's tail.

10:14.049 --> 10:17.100
- Volunteers?
- Uh, you-you mean us?

10:17.120 --> 10:18.230
Well, um, uh..

10:19.009 --> 10:23.039
Wait, it's my fault
all this happened, so I'll go.

10:23.059 --> 10:24.129
[dramatic music]

10:24.149 --> 10:27.179
Wait, Clumsy.
We'll all smurf you a hand.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.070
- Won't we?
- 'Yeah!'

10:31.090 --> 10:35.190
- Uh, you will?
- Sure. What are friends for?

10:35.210 --> 10:37.049
Go carefully.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.200
The rest of us will start
making the anti-smurf.

10:41.169 --> 10:44.049
Azrael must be
out here someplace.

10:44.070 --> 10:48.029
Yup. There's only one way
to find out where.

10:50.019 --> 10:52.169
Yoo-hoo! Azrael!

10:52.190 --> 10:54.190
[Azrael snarling]

10:54.210 --> 10:57.049
(Clumsy)
'Uh, here, kitty kitty kitty.'

10:57.070 --> 10:59.129
[snarling]

11:04.200 --> 11:06.210
(all)
Ole!

11:06.230 --> 11:08.179
[snarling]

11:13.210 --> 11:16.139
[snarling]

11:19.070 --> 11:21.090
(all)
Ole!

11:21.110 --> 11:22.169
[Smurfs cheer]

11:22.190 --> 11:24.110
Now to get those cat hairs.

11:26.059 --> 11:28.059
'Here's the cat hairs,
Papa Smurf.'

11:28.080 --> 11:30.120
Ah, well done, Clumsy!

11:32.120 --> 11:33.179
[cracking]

11:33.200 --> 11:35.039
Better hurry, Papa Smurf.

11:35.059 --> 11:37.110
Gargamel's starting
to loosen up.

11:37.129 --> 11:41.000
I...must...crack this glue.

11:41.019 --> 11:43.149
It's ready. It's smurfed.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.039
[Smurfs cheering]

11:50.000 --> 11:52.009
[all clamoring]

11:52.029 --> 11:55.000
I refuse to be stuck like this!

11:57.190 --> 12:02.029
Where can those nauseating,
foul, wile, little smurfs be?

12:02.049 --> 12:04.019
[rustling]

12:06.159 --> 12:08.230
Now, I've got you!

12:09.009 --> 12:10.129
Azrael!

12:10.149 --> 12:12.149
[mewing]

12:13.159 --> 12:15.159
[sobbing]
It's not fair!

12:15.179 --> 12:20.000
I'm big and strong
and they're puny and weak.

12:20.019 --> 12:22.029
And I never win.

12:22.049 --> 12:24.090
Never! Never!

12:24.110 --> 12:27.100
[crying]

12:34.090 --> 12:35.139
Watch out!

12:35.159 --> 12:38.200
Uh, oh, uh, sorry.
I-I didn't--

12:38.220 --> 12:40.230
Oh, that's okay, Clumsy.

12:41.009 --> 12:43.220
Right. We like you
even if you are clumsy.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.100
- Uh, you do?
- 'Sure.'

12:46.120 --> 12:48.179
Here's the surprise for you.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.059
Oh, for me?

12:51.080 --> 12:52.220
[explosion]

12:53.000 --> 12:55.200
[Jokey laughs]

12:58.159 --> 13:00.230
[theme music]
