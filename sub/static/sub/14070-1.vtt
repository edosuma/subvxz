01:43.438 --> 01:47.150
Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

01:47.233 --> 01:51.821
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.865
-It is almost here.
-What is it?

01:53.948 --> 01:55.283
What if it's the Demogorgon?

01:55.366 --> 01:58.411
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

01:58.494 --> 01:59.537
It's not the Demogorgon.

01:59.621 --> 02:01.873
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

02:01.956 --> 02:04.083
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya.

02:07.545 --> 02:08.963
Wait a minute.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.591
Did you hear that?

02:11.674 --> 02:13.092
That... that sound?

02:13.176 --> 02:15.845
Boom... boom...

02:15.928 --> 02:17.680
- Boom!

02:17.764 --> 02:19.641
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

02:19.724 --> 02:21.392
That came from something else.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.855
- The Demogorgon!

02:25.938 --> 02:27.398
-We're in deep shit.
-Will, your action!

02:27.482 --> 02:28.775
-I don't know!
-Fireball him!

02:28.858 --> 02:30.151
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

02:30.234 --> 02:32.070
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.697
-Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
-Cast Protection.

02:34.781 --> 02:37.492
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

02:37.575 --> 02:39.369
It stomps towards you.

02:39.452 --> 02:40.453
-Boom!
-Fireball him!

02:40.536 --> 02:42.830
-Another stomp, boom!
-Cast Protection.

02:42.914 --> 02:45.750
- He roars in anger!

02:45.833 --> 02:47.335
- Fireball!

02:47.418 --> 02:49.045
- Oh, shit!
- Where'd it go?

02:49.128 --> 02:50.838
- Where is it?
- I don't know!

02:50.922 --> 02:52.465
- Is it a 13?
- I don't know!

02:52.548 --> 02:53.716
- Where is it?
- Oh, my God!

02:53.800 --> 02:55.385
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:55.468 --> 02:56.552
- Mike!
- Can you find it yet?

02:56.636 --> 02:57.720
No, I can't find it!

02:57.804 --> 02:59.472
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:59.555 --> 03:01.349
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

03:01.432 --> 03:03.559
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

03:03.643 --> 03:06.813
- Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
- Why do we have to go?

03:06.938 --> 03:09.607
-Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
-It's a school night, Michael.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.151
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.778
-But that'll ruin the flow!
-Michael--

03:13.861 --> 03:15.113
I'm serious, Mom.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.657
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.659
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

03:19.742 --> 03:21.619
You've been playing for ten hours?

03:22.954 --> 03:26.749
-Dad, don't you think that 20 more--
-I think you should listen to your mother.

03:26.833 --> 03:30.294
--Dang dumb piece of junk.

03:31.337 --> 03:33.297
Oh, I got it!

03:33.381 --> 03:35.258
-Does the seven count?
-It was a seven?

03:35.925 --> 03:38.469
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

03:43.099 --> 03:44.267
Yo, hey, guys.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.227
- Does anyone want this?
- No.

03:49.689 --> 03:50.857
Yeah.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.234
No, I don't think...

03:54.360 --> 03:55.945
Yeah, he's cute.

03:56.028 --> 03:59.365
Barb, no, I don't think so.

03:59.449 --> 04:00.908
-Barb, you're not--
-Hey, Nancy.

04:01.784 --> 04:03.161
There's a slice left if you want it.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.580
-Sausage and pepperoni!
-Hold on.

04:12.462 --> 04:16.382
-There's something wrong with your sister.
-What are you talking about?

04:16.466 --> 04:18.259
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- Yeah.

04:18.342 --> 04:20.845
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.680
Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

04:22.764 --> 04:24.098
She's always been a real jerk.

04:24.182 --> 04:26.058
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

04:26.142 --> 04:28.519
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

04:28.603 --> 04:29.812
Four years ago!

04:29.937 --> 04:31.355
- Just saying.
- Later.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.984
-It was a seven.
-Huh?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.819
The roll, it was a seven.

04:37.904 --> 04:40.114
The Demogorgon, it got me.

04:41.491 --> 04:43.159
See you tomorrow.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.844
- Good night, ladies.
- Kiss your mom 'night for me.

05:03.179 --> 05:05.264
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.016
-Any comic?
-Yeah.

05:07.892 --> 05:10.019
Hey! Hey!

05:10.102 --> 05:12.063
I didn't say "go"!

05:14.106 --> 05:16.150
Get back here!

05:16.234 --> 05:18.361
I'm gonna kill you!

05:18.444 --> 05:20.863
I'll take your X-Men 134!

05:27.161 --> 05:28.704
Son of a bitch.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.140
Mom?

06:29.223 --> 06:31.767
- Jonathan? Mom?

06:53.706 --> 06:56.417
- Hello? Hello?

09:29.111 --> 09:31.405
And that's it
for News Center this morning.

09:31.489 --> 09:32.823
Thanks for joining us.

09:32.907 --> 09:35.201
Let's hand off now to Liz
at the news desk.

09:35.284 --> 09:36.702
All right, thank you, Donna.

09:36.786 --> 09:37.870
Turning now to local news,

09:37.953 --> 09:41.373
we're getting reports of surges
and power outages all across the county.

09:41.457 --> 09:44.418
Last night, hundreds of homes
in East Hawkins were affected,

09:44.502 --> 09:46.879
leaving many residents in the dark.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.090
The cause of the outage is still unknown.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.383
We reached out to Roane County
Water and Electric,

09:51.467 --> 09:54.011
and a spokesperson says
that they are confident

09:54.095 --> 09:56.680
power will be restored
to all remaining homes

09:56.764 --> 09:58.307
within the next several hours.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.043
Mmm.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.702
In other news,
you might wanna stay home tonight

10:59.785 --> 11:01.078
or at least pack an umbrella.

11:01.162 --> 11:03.581
We turn to everybody's favorite
morning weather guy, Charles.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.087
Where the hell are they?

11:10.171 --> 11:12.590
-Jonathan?
-Check the couch!

11:12.673 --> 11:13.799
Ugh, I did.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.386
Oh... Got them.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.848
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.766
-Yeah, see you later.
-Where's Will?

11:22.850 --> 11:23.934
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

11:24.018 --> 11:25.144
- He's probably still sleeping.

11:25.227 --> 11:28.355
-Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
-Mom, I'm making breakfast.

11:28.439 --> 11:30.274
I told you this a thousand times.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.986
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.743
-He came home last night, right?
-He's not in his room?

11:40.826 --> 11:43.120
-Did he come home or not?
-I don't know.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.455
-You don't know?
-No.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.582
I got home late.
I was working.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.708
You were working?

11:47.791 --> 11:49.710
Eric asked if I could cover.
I said yeah.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.253
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

11:51.337 --> 11:54.048
-Jonathan, we've talked about this.
-I know, I know.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.050
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.302
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.055
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- I can't believe you.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.724
I can't believe you sometimes.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.272
--That's disgusting.

12:10.356 --> 12:12.566
- You're disgusting!
- Hello?

12:12.650 --> 12:14.401
Hi, Karen.
It's Joyce.

12:14.485 --> 12:16.528
- Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

12:16.612 --> 12:17.780
- Hey!
- Quiet!

12:17.863 --> 12:19.573
-Language.
-Are you kidding?

12:19.657 --> 12:21.033
Was that Will I heard back there?

12:21.116 --> 12:22.618
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.119
Will didn't spend the night?

12:24.203 --> 12:26.622
No, he left here
a little bit after 8:00.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.040
Why? He's not home?

12:28.123 --> 12:31.961
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

12:32.044 --> 12:34.046
-Thank you so much. Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

12:56.110 --> 12:58.904
That's weird.
I don't see him.

12:58.988 --> 13:00.531
I'm telling you, his mom's right.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.449
He probably just
went to class early again.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.035
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

13:05.119 --> 13:07.037
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.374
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.085
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

13:14.837 --> 13:18.757
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

13:22.511 --> 13:24.346
I'd go with Toothless.

13:24.430 --> 13:27.891
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.727
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.812
"I told you a million times."

13:31.895 --> 13:33.939
--Do the arm thing.

13:34.732 --> 13:36.066
Do it, freak!

13:42.406 --> 13:44.658
God, it gets me every time.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.829
- Assholes.
- I think it's kinda cool.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.081
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.042
Like Mr. Fantastic.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.377
Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.512
So, did he call?

14:05.596 --> 14:08.140
Keep your voice down.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.808
Did he?

14:09.892 --> 14:11.643
I told you, it's not like that.

14:12.227 --> 14:15.981
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.983
We just...

14:19.109 --> 14:20.611
made out a couple times.

14:20.694 --> 14:24.073
"We just... made out a couple times."

14:24.156 --> 14:25.491
Nance, seriously,

14:25.574 --> 14:27.659
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.161
No, I'm not.

14:29.244 --> 14:32.915
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.793
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol--

14:35.876 --> 14:37.169
Oh, that's gross!

14:37.252 --> 14:39.421
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

14:40.255 --> 14:42.341
- Two-time thing.

14:47.179 --> 14:48.472
You were saying?

14:58.899 --> 15:00.359
-Steve...
-Mmm-hmm?

15:00.442 --> 15:02.111
-I have to go.
-In a minute.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.864
Steve.
I really, like...

15:05.948 --> 15:07.783
Seriously, I have to go.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.243
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

15:09.326 --> 15:11.203
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

15:11.286 --> 15:14.206
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.542
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

15:16.625 --> 15:18.335
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

15:18.419 --> 15:20.587
-Well, then, just let me help.
-You failed chem.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.673
-C-minus.
-Well, in that case...

15:22.756 --> 15:25.092
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

15:25.175 --> 15:28.137
-Are you crazy? My mom would not--
-I'll climb through your window.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.389
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

15:30.472 --> 15:31.723
You are crazy.

15:31.807 --> 15:33.642
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.018
We can just...

15:35.102 --> 15:37.020
We can just, like, chill in my car.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.065
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

15:40.149 --> 15:43.569
Steve... I have to study.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.362
I'm not kidding.

15:45.446 --> 15:47.739
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.493
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

15:57.458 --> 16:00.043
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.254
To study.

16:15.476 --> 16:16.768
Good of you to show.

16:16.852 --> 16:20.522
Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

16:20.606 --> 16:24.276
-Hey, Chief.
-Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.360
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.988
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.699
While you were drinking or sleeping,

16:30.782 --> 16:33.744
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

16:33.827 --> 16:34.828
Phil Larson called.

16:34.912 --> 16:37.581
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.124
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.460
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.086
On a more pressing matter,

16:43.170 --> 16:45.214
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.050
Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.344
-Just give me a minute.
-Joyce is very upset.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.304
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.723
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

16:54.806 --> 16:58.685
-Chief, she's already in your--
-Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

17:09.154 --> 17:11.949
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.618
And I apologize again.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.078
I'm going out of my mind!

17:16.161 --> 17:19.748
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

17:19.831 --> 17:21.833
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.460
-He wouldn't do that.
-Well, you never know.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.254
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

17:25.337 --> 17:26.922
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

17:27.005 --> 17:28.674
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

17:28.757 --> 17:31.718
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.304
He's not like... most.

17:34.388 --> 17:38.267
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.185
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

17:40.269 --> 17:42.312
-They laugh at him, his clothes--
-His clothes?

17:42.396 --> 17:44.356
-What's wrong with his clothes?
-I don't know.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.733
-Does that matter?
-Maybe.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.861
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

17:49.945 --> 17:53.657
Lonnie...
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.075
Called him a fag.

17:55.158 --> 17:59.079
-Is he?
-He's missing is what he is.

18:00.581 --> 18:02.958
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

18:05.085 --> 18:09.423
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

18:09.506 --> 18:12.259
-But he has nothing to do with this.
-Why don't you give me his number?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.219
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

18:14.303 --> 18:17.514
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

18:17.598 --> 18:19.725
the kid is with a parent or relative.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.310
What about the other time?

18:21.393 --> 18:24.730
-What?
-You said, "99 out of 100."

18:24.855 --> 18:26.857
-What about the other time, the one?
-Joyce.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.066
The one!

18:28.150 --> 18:29.985
- Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?

18:30.068 --> 18:31.820
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

18:31.903 --> 18:32.988
in the four years I've been working here?

18:33.071 --> 18:34.239
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

18:34.323 --> 18:37.451
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

18:37.534 --> 18:39.244
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

18:39.328 --> 18:41.997
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.790
He will talk to me before he talks to--

18:43.874 --> 18:45.834
-What, a pig?
-A cop!

18:46.918 --> 18:49.921
Just find my son, Hop.

18:50.005 --> 18:51.882
Find him!

19:03.477 --> 19:04.645
Dr. Brenner.

19:06.605 --> 19:08.273
This way, gentlemen.

19:08.357 --> 19:11.193
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

19:11.276 --> 19:15.113
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.930
- This is where it came from?
- Yes.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.015
And the girl?

21:06.641 --> 21:08.769
She can't have gone far.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.740
All right, and one more.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.618
Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

22:06.701 --> 22:08.245
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.664
I don't know,
37 points per game average--

22:10.747 --> 22:12.457
- Thirty-seven now, but...
- Mr. Basket.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.114
Hey!

22:44.197 --> 22:45.323
Come here!

22:46.074 --> 22:47.367
Hey, come here!

22:52.038 --> 22:54.082
You think you can steal from me, boy?

22:56.585 --> 22:57.752
What in the hell?

22:59.296 --> 23:02.132
--Remember, finish chapter 12

23:02.215 --> 23:06.011
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

23:06.094 --> 23:08.221
and other forms of science investigation.

23:08.305 --> 23:12.183
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

23:12.267 --> 23:15.312
It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.356
So, did it come?

23:18.440 --> 23:19.816
Sorry, boys.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.776
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

23:22.986 --> 23:23.903
it came.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.491
Yes!

23:28.575 --> 23:30.368
The Heathkit ham shack.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.911
- Whoa.
- Ain't she a beaut?

23:31.995 --> 23:34.039
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

23:34.122 --> 23:35.290
Think bigger.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.375
-California?
-Bigger.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.835
Australia?

23:39.794 --> 23:41.379
--Oh, man!

23:41.463 --> 23:44.341
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.508
Lucas!

23:45.592 --> 23:46.968
- Sorry.

23:49.512 --> 23:51.931
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

23:52.015 --> 23:54.726
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.479
What are you doing?

23:57.562 --> 23:58.730
Hello, this is Dustin,

23:58.813 --> 24:01.816
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.069
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

24:06.237 --> 24:11.076
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

24:16.081 --> 24:17.624
Okay, okay, okay.

24:17.707 --> 24:20.669
One at a time, all right?
You.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.380
-You said he takes what?
-Mirkwood.

24:23.463 --> 24:26.049
-Mirkwood?
-Yeah.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.636
-Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
-I have not. That sounds made up to me.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.513
No, it's from Lord of the Rings.

24:31.596 --> 24:34.474
-Well, The Hobbit.
-It doesn't matter.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.393
- He asked!
- "He asked!"

24:36.476 --> 24:38.061
- Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

24:38.186 --> 24:40.105
-What'd I just say?
-Shut up.

24:40.188 --> 24:43.483
One at a damn time.
You.

24:43.566 --> 24:46.778
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.238
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.824
-Yeah, all right, I think I know that--
-We can show you, if you want.

24:50.907 --> 24:52.242
I said that I know it!

24:52.325 --> 24:54.244
-We can help look.
-Yeah.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.246
- No.

24:56.329 --> 24:59.457
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.750
Immediately.

25:00.834 --> 25:04.629
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

25:04.713 --> 25:05.797
no nonsense.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.841
This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.

25:07.924 --> 25:10.719
-The Hobbit.
-Shut up!

25:10.802 --> 25:12.178
- Hey!
- Stop it!

25:13.471 --> 25:15.390
Do I make myself clear?

25:20.603 --> 25:25.150
Do I make myself... clear?

25:26.151 --> 25:27.944
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.499
Ring-a-ding-ding!

25:41.583 --> 25:43.293
Anybody home?

25:43.376 --> 25:45.003
Password?

25:45.086 --> 25:47.046
Uh, Rada...

25:48.381 --> 25:50.884
Radaga-- Radagast?

25:50.967 --> 25:53.386
Yeah. You may enter.

25:53.470 --> 25:55.930
Thank you, sir.

25:56.931 --> 25:58.558
So, guess what?

25:58.641 --> 26:01.102
I got off early and...

26:01.186 --> 26:03.855
Ta-da!
Poltergeist.

26:03.938 --> 26:05.482
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

26:05.565 --> 26:06.941
I changed my mind.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.819
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

26:09.903 --> 26:12.405
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

26:12.489 --> 26:13.490
Oh, yeah?

26:13.573 --> 26:15.241
Not even of clowns?

26:15.325 --> 26:16.409
No.

26:16.493 --> 26:18.870
What about my witch?

26:18.953 --> 26:20.371
-No. Mom...
-Ooh...

26:20.455 --> 26:22.290
-I'm not five anymore.
-But Will Byers...

26:22.373 --> 26:24.834
-I'm going to cook you up in my--
-Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

26:29.172 --> 26:30.298
Will?

26:30.381 --> 26:31.966
- Will?
- Will?

26:33.510 --> 26:34.761
Will?

26:37.722 --> 26:39.307
-Will?
-Will!

26:40.642 --> 26:42.101
- Will!
- Will?

26:42.185 --> 26:43.728
Will!

26:43.812 --> 26:45.480
Where are you?

26:54.864 --> 26:56.074
Geez.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.701
Your parents forget to feed you?

27:02.372 --> 27:04.207
Is that why you ran away?

27:07.669 --> 27:08.878
They, uh...

27:09.879 --> 27:11.047
They hurt you?

27:13.925 --> 27:15.635
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

27:15.718 --> 27:17.387
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

27:20.431 --> 27:21.641
All right.

27:23.476 --> 27:26.855
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

27:27.522 --> 27:28.940
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.109
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

27:32.569 --> 27:34.445
We got a deal?

27:36.322 --> 27:40.076
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

27:40.159 --> 27:43.538
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.331
See? Like this. Here.

27:45.415 --> 27:48.334
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

27:48.418 --> 27:51.880
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

28:01.222 --> 28:02.265
Eleven?

28:03.308 --> 28:04.601
What's that mean?

28:05.476 --> 28:07.228
What's it mean?

28:08.313 --> 28:10.565
-No.
-Well, I'll be damned.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.358
She speaks.

28:12.442 --> 28:14.110
"No"? No, what?

28:15.820 --> 28:18.907
All right.
I guess no more food, then.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.158
Eleven.

28:21.534 --> 28:22.577
Yeah.

28:23.912 --> 28:25.455
What's it mean?

28:27.206 --> 28:28.625
Eleven.

28:30.335 --> 28:32.503
All right, then.

28:32.587 --> 28:34.339
Here you go.

28:34.422 --> 28:36.174
Take it easy, take it easy.

28:38.551 --> 28:41.179
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

28:41.262 --> 28:43.389
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

28:43.473 --> 28:45.099
kidnapped or something.

28:46.601 --> 28:49.187
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

28:49.270 --> 28:53.733
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

29:20.635 --> 29:22.387
Will Byers?

29:25.181 --> 29:26.557
Will!

29:27.809 --> 29:30.061
Will Byers?

29:33.064 --> 29:35.066
Come on, kid!

29:35.149 --> 29:36.401
Will?

29:37.527 --> 29:41.322
--Hey! I got something.

29:48.371 --> 29:51.291
-That his bike?
-Yeah, he must have crashed.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.210
You think
he got hurt in the fall?

29:55.086 --> 29:56.629
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

29:56.713 --> 29:58.631
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.341
He would've walked it home.

30:11.352 --> 30:12.312
...get off work if I win.

30:12.395 --> 30:14.063
Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...

30:14.147 --> 30:16.941
...but we will cover
whatever the damages are to your property.

30:17.025 --> 30:18.693
- It's just, um...
- That's for sure.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.203
Is Lonnie there?

30:29.287 --> 30:31.581
- Lonnie isn't here right now.
- Can you please--

30:31.664 --> 30:33.541
-I told you, Lonnie's not here.
-Who is this?

30:33.624 --> 30:35.626
-His girlfriend, Cynthia.
-Cynthia.

30:35.710 --> 30:38.421
-Who the hell is this?
-Cynthia, this is Joyce.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.256
-Who?
-Lonnie's ex-wife.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.383
-I really need to speak to him--
-Lonnie's not here.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.344
-Can you please put-- No!
-Why don't you call back later?

30:44.427 --> 30:45.636
No, not later. Now!

30:45.720 --> 30:46.888
- Can--

30:46.971 --> 30:48.389
- Bitch!
- Mom.

30:48.473 --> 30:50.933
-What?
-You have to stay calm.

30:59.692 --> 31:00.735
Hey, you've reached Lonnie.

31:00.818 --> 31:03.029
Leave a message
and I'll holler right back at ya.

31:03.112 --> 31:06.866
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.

31:06.949 --> 31:09.452
Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.703
I need...

31:10.787 --> 31:13.373
I just need you to call me back,
please, just--

31:16.042 --> 31:17.794
- Damn it! Damn it!

31:17.877 --> 31:19.545
--Mom?

31:19.629 --> 31:20.630
What?

31:22.673 --> 31:23.841
Cops.

31:38.689 --> 31:42.235
-It was just lying there?
-Yeah. Cal?

31:43.152 --> 31:46.823
-Did it have any blood on it, or--
-No, no, no, no, no...

31:46.906 --> 31:48.408
Phil?

31:48.491 --> 31:50.910
If you found the bike out there,
why are you here?

31:51.953 --> 31:54.831
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- Yeah.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.250
So...

31:58.209 --> 31:59.377
maybe he came home.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.504
You think I didn't check
my own house?

32:01.587 --> 32:03.381
I'm not saying that.

32:04.298 --> 32:07.051
- Has this always been here?
- What? I don't know.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.971
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

32:11.597 --> 32:12.765
You're not sure?

32:24.735 --> 32:25.736
Hey.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.115
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

32:29.198 --> 32:31.701
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

33:50.655 --> 33:52.323
- Hey!
- Jesus!

33:52.406 --> 33:54.992
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.537
--What's going on?

33:59.705 --> 34:00.831
Hello?

34:00.915 --> 34:04.001
-Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
-Listen, I want you to call Flo.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.419
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

34:05.503 --> 34:08.631
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.008
Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

34:18.057 --> 34:20.810
We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.770
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says--

34:22.853 --> 34:24.355
-I don't care what the chief said.
-Michael!

34:24.438 --> 34:26.107
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.400
More reason to stay put.

34:27.483 --> 34:29.527
-Mom!
-End of discussion.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.660
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.162
-That's cool, right?
-No, not cool.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.497
What? Why not?

34:41.581 --> 34:44.792
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

34:44.875 --> 34:47.920
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

34:48.004 --> 34:49.797
-This is such bullshit.
-Language.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.299
So we're under house arrest?

34:51.382 --> 34:53.301
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

34:53.384 --> 34:55.678
-Wait, this is Will's fault?
-Nancy, take that back.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.305
-No!
-You're just pissed off

34:57.388 --> 34:59.348
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.226
-Steve?
-Who is Steve?

35:02.310 --> 35:04.729
-Her new boyfriend.
-You are such a douchebag, Mike!

35:04.812 --> 35:06.606
- Language!

35:08.274 --> 35:09.692
Nancy, come back.

35:10.526 --> 35:11.777
Come back!

35:11.861 --> 35:15.281
It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

35:15.990 --> 35:17.033
You see, Michael?

35:17.116 --> 35:19.410
- You see what happens?
- What happens when what?

35:19.493 --> 35:23.080
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

35:23.164 --> 35:25.207
That is really unfair, son.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.500
We care.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.174
-Mike!
-Let him go.

35:35.885 --> 35:38.304
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

35:39.055 --> 35:40.598
What did I do?

35:42.933 --> 35:45.519
Hey! What'd I do?

35:48.564 --> 35:50.608
- Will!
- Will Byers!

35:50.691 --> 35:51.734
Will!

35:51.817 --> 35:53.653
Will, we're here for you, bud!

35:56.530 --> 35:58.741
He's a good student.

35:58.824 --> 36:02.244
- What?
- Will. He's a good student.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.954
Great one, actually.

36:04.455 --> 36:06.374
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

36:06.457 --> 36:09.752
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.837
I always had
a distaste for science.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.881
Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

36:13.964 --> 36:16.300
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

36:16.384 --> 36:19.011
Ratliff?
You bet.

36:19.095 --> 36:21.263
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

36:21.347 --> 36:25.142
Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

36:25.768 --> 36:27.269
Sarah, my daughter...

36:28.646 --> 36:32.817
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.361
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

36:35.444 --> 36:37.196
I never needed to look elsewhere.

36:37.738 --> 36:39.490
Your daughter,
what grade is she?

36:39.573 --> 36:42.368
-Maybe I'll get her in my class.
-No, she, uh...

36:42.451 --> 36:44.995
She lives with her mom in the city.

36:45.079 --> 36:48.541
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

36:50.751 --> 36:53.629
-She died a few years back.
-Sorry?

36:53.713 --> 36:54.964
His kid.

37:07.435 --> 37:08.978
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.897
-Lucas?
-Hey, it's Lucas.

37:11.981 --> 37:12.982
I know it's you.

37:13.065 --> 37:16.235
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

37:16.318 --> 37:17.945
I'm done. Over.

37:18.028 --> 37:20.448
I'm worried about Will. Over.

37:20.531 --> 37:22.575
Yeah.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.328
This is crazy. Over.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.038
I was thinking...

37:29.540 --> 37:32.376
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.461
He cast Fireball.

37:33.544 --> 37:37.298
-Over.
-What's your point? Over.

37:37.381 --> 37:42.094
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

37:42.178 --> 37:44.054
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

37:44.138 --> 37:45.264
Over.

37:48.058 --> 37:50.478
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.301
What are you doing here?

38:22.384 --> 38:24.678
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

38:24.762 --> 38:27.598
-I figured we'd just study here.
-No. No way.

38:27.681 --> 38:29.934
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

38:30.017 --> 38:31.811
So just... bear with me.

38:34.855 --> 38:35.856
What'd I tell you?

38:37.274 --> 38:38.400
Ninja.

38:52.456 --> 38:53.916
You like that ice cream, huh?

38:55.167 --> 38:56.585
Smile looks good on you.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.004
You know, smile?

39:08.013 --> 39:09.765
All right.
You just sit tight.

39:09.849 --> 39:13.227
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

39:15.437 --> 39:18.107
--Yeah, yeah, yeah...

39:19.233 --> 39:21.735
-Hey, can I help you?
-Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

39:21.819 --> 39:24.071
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

39:24.154 --> 39:26.907
-So try back tomorrow morning.
-Connie Frazier. Social Services.

39:26.991 --> 39:29.869
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

39:29.952 --> 39:32.788
-That's a heck of a drive.
-Not too bad this time of night.

39:32.872 --> 39:35.124
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

39:35.207 --> 39:39.169
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

39:39.253 --> 39:41.881
-Children I work with usually are.
-Right, right.

39:42.464 --> 39:45.301
-So, where is she?
-Right. She's in the kitchen.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.219
-Come on up. I'll introduce you.
-Thank you.

39:47.303 --> 39:49.096
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

39:49.179 --> 39:50.222
-It's fine.
-You know, it's funny.

39:50.306 --> 39:52.725
- Your, uh, voice sounds different on the--

40:23.547 --> 40:26.467
Ah, man.
This is it.

40:35.225 --> 40:37.061
Hey, guys.
You feel that?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.774
-I think maybe we should go back.
-No.

40:41.857 --> 40:44.485
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

40:44.568 --> 40:45.694
Come on.

40:46.820 --> 40:50.157
Just stay on channel six.
Don't do anything stupid.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.163
Hey, guys, wait up.

40:56.705 --> 40:58.123
Wait up!

41:04.004 --> 41:06.799
"Which polymers occur naturally?"

41:08.217 --> 41:10.678
Starch and cellulose.

41:10.761 --> 41:12.012
Mmm.

41:12.096 --> 41:16.350
"In a molecule of CH4,
the hydrogen atoms are spatially oriented

41:16.433 --> 41:18.894
-towards the centers of--"
-Tetrahedrons.

41:18.978 --> 41:21.480
Wow.
Jesus, how many of these did you make?

41:21.563 --> 41:23.399
You said you wanted to help.

41:24.441 --> 41:25.651
How about this? How about...

41:25.734 --> 41:27.277
How about every time
that you get something right,

41:27.361 --> 41:28.862
I have to take off
an item of clothing.

41:28.946 --> 41:30.531
But every time
that you get something wrong--

41:30.614 --> 41:31.824
-Uh, pass.
-Oh, come on.

41:31.907 --> 41:32.950
-Come on.
-No.

41:33.033 --> 41:34.410
-Come on. It'll be fun.
-No.

41:34.493 --> 41:35.869
"During fractional distillation,

41:35.953 --> 41:38.622
hydrocarbons are separated
according to their--"

41:38.706 --> 41:39.748
Melting point.

41:41.208 --> 41:43.377
Ooh, it's boiling points.

41:43.460 --> 41:44.878
That's what I meant.

41:44.962 --> 41:46.964
Yeah, that's not what you said.

41:47.881 --> 41:49.675
-No.
-No?

41:50.551 --> 41:52.886
Oh, do you need...
Do you need help, or...

41:52.970 --> 41:54.013
No.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.161
Steve.
Steve, come on.

42:17.244 --> 42:18.245
What?

42:18.328 --> 42:20.456
Are you crazy?
My parents are here.

42:22.166 --> 42:24.668
That's weird, I... don't see them.

42:28.505 --> 42:33.177
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

42:33.260 --> 42:35.846
-get another notch on your belt.
-No. Nancy, no.

42:35.929 --> 42:38.057
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

42:38.140 --> 42:39.725
You mean, you're not a slut.

42:40.559 --> 42:41.643
That's not what I'm saying.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.479
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

42:43.979 --> 42:45.230
Shut up.

42:48.108 --> 42:49.485
Bad Steve.

42:49.568 --> 42:53.113
Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

42:53.697 --> 42:55.741
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

42:56.658 --> 42:58.702
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

43:05.125 --> 43:07.711
"Compared to the rate
of inorganic reactions,

43:07.795 --> 43:11.548
the rate of organic reactions
is generally..."

43:14.551 --> 43:17.596
Jonathan, wow.
You took these?

43:18.514 --> 43:20.015
These are great.

43:21.141 --> 43:24.103
Wow, they really are.

43:25.270 --> 43:28.357
- I know I haven't been there for you.
- I've been...

43:28.440 --> 43:30.526
working so hard and I...

43:30.609 --> 43:32.444
I just feel bad.
I don't even...

43:32.528 --> 43:34.988
barely know what's going on with you.

43:35.072 --> 43:37.825
All right?
I am sorry about that.

43:41.203 --> 43:42.496
Hey, what is it?

43:43.413 --> 43:44.748
What is it, honey?

43:46.500 --> 43:48.919
- Nothing.
- Tell me. Tell me.

43:49.002 --> 43:51.046
-Come on. You can...
-No.

43:51.130 --> 43:52.297
It's just...

43:53.507 --> 43:55.300
I should've been there for him.

43:55.384 --> 43:58.387
No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

43:58.470 --> 44:01.682
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

44:01.765 --> 44:05.435
- He is... close.
- I know it.  I...

44:06.103 --> 44:08.814
I feel it in my heart.

44:09.565 --> 44:12.359
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

44:15.112 --> 44:16.780
-Yeah.
-Oh, look at this.

44:16.864 --> 44:19.241
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

44:21.577 --> 44:23.745
-I mean, that's it, right?
-Yeah.

44:23.829 --> 44:25.622
That's it.
That's the one.

44:29.209 --> 44:32.129
- Hello?

44:32.212 --> 44:33.839
- Hello?

44:33.922 --> 44:34.965
Lonnie?

44:35.048 --> 44:36.800
-Dad?
-Hopper?

44:36.884 --> 44:38.927
--Who is this?

44:42.222 --> 44:43.265
Will?

44:44.141 --> 44:45.225
-Will?
-It's Will?

44:48.061 --> 44:49.438
--Mom, it's Will?

44:50.439 --> 44:51.857
- Who is this?

44:51.940 --> 44:54.067
- What have you done to my boy?
- What? What?

44:54.151 --> 44:55.652
Give me back my son!

44:57.613 --> 44:59.448
--Hello?

44:59.531 --> 45:00.782
Hello, who is this?

45:00.866 --> 45:03.619
- Hello? Who is this?

45:03.702 --> 45:06.163
- Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?

45:06.246 --> 45:07.915
- It was him.
- Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

45:07.998 --> 45:09.207
-Yes.
-What did he say?

45:09.291 --> 45:11.418
He just breathed.
He just breathed.

45:11.501 --> 45:13.462
- And was someone else there?
- I...

45:13.545 --> 45:16.256
-Mom, who was there? Who was it?
-It was him.

45:16.340 --> 45:19.051
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

45:20.344 --> 45:21.720
--Will!

45:22.721 --> 45:25.223
- Will!
- Byers!

45:25.307 --> 45:28.060
I've got your X-Men 134!

45:28.810 --> 45:30.896
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

45:30.979 --> 45:32.230
Seriously, Dustin?

45:32.314 --> 45:34.608
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

45:34.691 --> 45:36.401
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

45:36.485 --> 45:38.487
No, you're just being a big sissy!

45:39.112 --> 45:42.491
Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

45:42.574 --> 45:45.452
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

45:45.535 --> 45:48.372
-And we have no weapons or anything?
-Dustin, shut up.

45:48.455 --> 45:50.457
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

45:50.540 --> 45:52.668
- Shut up. Shut up.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.419
Did you guys hear that?
