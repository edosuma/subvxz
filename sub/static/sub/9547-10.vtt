00:42.958 --> 00:44.103
This is terrible.

00:44.256 --> 00:45.986
It's like the traffic jams.

00:46.139 --> 00:49.095
It's true, Mr. Monk,
it is very similar to a traffic jam.

00:49.588 --> 00:51.252
I'll never make it.

00:52.128 --> 00:54.908
Doctor Kruger charges me
for the sessions I miss.

00:55.084 --> 00:57.514
- Well, you can't blame it on me.
- I do that anyway.

00:57.718 --> 01:00.496
Hey, that's Macmillan Museum.
I was just went there on a field trip.

01:01.381 --> 01:02.870
And in the next session,

01:03.133 --> 01:05.732
all we're gonna talk about,
is how much I resent

01:05.747 --> 01:07.621
being charged for 
the last session

01:07.681 --> 01:09.680
will take me five 
sessions to recover.

01:09.833 --> 01:11.442
You guys should 
have checked it out.

01:11.497 --> 01:13.800
- They have this big diamond from Egypt,
- Julie.

01:13.826 --> 01:15.449
Called the star of Bethlehem, it's like

01:15.464 --> 01:18.110
Julie, your mom and I
are very upset.

01:19.232 --> 01:21.218
We can't talk... right now.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.707
- I hate Christmas.
- You now like Christmas.

01:25.918 --> 01:28.523
You wouldn't like it either
if you hated it as much as I did.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.485
But it's so joyful.

01:30.616 --> 01:31.616
Don't...

01:31.868 --> 01:33.354
get me started on joy.

01:33.999 --> 01:37.694
When you're older, you'll understand.
Joy is a trick, a diversion,

01:37.901 --> 01:40.842
it doesn't last forever.
It breaks your heart every time.

01:42.906 --> 01:44.181
Damn joy!

01:44.374 --> 01:46.901
We really
gotta get to the doctor Kruger.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.433
What was that?

01:52.645 --> 01:53.981
What's going on?

01:54.178 --> 01:55.579
We gotta call it in.

01:55.821 --> 01:56.982
Call what in?

02:01.756 --> 02:02.763
Over here!

02:07.080 --> 02:08.306
Santa Klaus!

02:16.803 --> 02:18.205
You can't keep that.

02:18.489 --> 02:19.978
Give me that,
that's evidence.

02:20.176 --> 02:22.483
- Of what?
- He's breaking the law. Natalie

02:22.498 --> 02:24.577
He's creating a nuisance.
A public nuisance,

02:24.730 --> 02:26.591
which is the worst kind of nuisance
there is.

02:26.745 --> 02:28.824
- What are you doing?
- Going up there.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.759
<i>- Mr. Monk's going to the roof?
- He hates heights.</i>

02:32.219 --> 02:33.423
Is it okay?

02:33.609 --> 02:36.193
Trudy died ten years ago this week.

02:36.344 --> 02:37.521
It's been really tough.

02:38.340 --> 02:39.708
I mean tougher than usual.

02:40.401 --> 02:43.437
Who wants this?
Who wants a Teddy Bear?

02:45.060 --> 02:46.758
Merry christmas!

02:49.607 --> 02:51.074
Are you on drugs?

02:51.826 --> 02:54.840
It's all right. Just spreading a little
christmas cheer, that's all.

02:55.245 --> 02:57.417
Merry christmas!

02:59.423 --> 03:01.028
Merry christmas!

03:01.081 --> 03:02.476
Excuse me!

03:02.609 --> 03:03.940
Mr. Kringle!

03:04.204 --> 03:07.058
There are city ordinances
against this kind of thing.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.651
Littering

03:09.061 --> 03:10.550
trespassing...

03:20.196 --> 03:21.276
Mr. Monk!

03:25.790 --> 03:26.832
Mr. Monk!

03:27.060 --> 03:28.237
What did you do?

03:30.297 --> 03:31.609
You shot Santa Claus.

03:37.794 --> 03:42.785

04:42.879 --> 04:43.882
You okay?

04:44.441 --> 04:45.618
I don't know.

04:45.896 --> 04:48.111
It's been a long time
since I pulled a trigger.

04:48.219 --> 04:49.917
Yeah, I know, it's the worst.

04:50.519 --> 04:51.619
How's he doing?

04:52.224 --> 04:53.578
He took one in the shoulder.

04:53.674 --> 04:54.735
He's gonna make it.

04:54.831 --> 04:55.937
That's good, I guess.

04:56.237 --> 04:58.282
We were in the car and
he was talking about

04:58.337 --> 04:59.765
how much he hated christmas

05:00.219 --> 05:01.994
and how he didn't like Joy.

05:02.893 --> 05:03.703
Joy?

05:03.780 --> 05:06.769
Yeah, and then he saw Santa Claus
and he got really, really mad and.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.718
He, Sweetie, why don't you go wait
in the car and I'll be right there?

05:11.482 --> 05:13.211
Natalie,
we're gonna have to talk to her.

05:13.226 --> 05:14.384
Not today you don't.

05:14.970 --> 05:17.092
I. I didn't have a choice.

05:17.459 --> 05:19.640
- He was coming at am.
- Whoa whoa whoa, Monk.

05:19.949 --> 05:21.996
Don't say anything.
I don't want to hear it.

05:22.028 --> 05:24.173
I'm calling for your good friend
garret price.

05:24.263 --> 05:26.226
- He'll be here in a minute.
- Garret Price?

05:26.241 --> 05:27.637
You think I need a lawyer?

05:27.747 --> 05:29.579
My god!
Santa Claus!

05:29.878 --> 05:31.204
We love you, santa!

05:37.034 --> 05:39.075
That's him.
That's the guy!

05:39.219 --> 05:41.104
Why.
Why did you do it?

05:44.859 --> 05:46.048
Just trying

05:46.081 --> 05:49.111
to spread a little joy,
a little christmas cheer.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.480
This guy's nuts!

05:50.771 --> 05:51.948
You're nuts!

05:56.821 --> 05:58.557
Yeah, I think you might need a lawyer.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.703
Wipes.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.614
No, you can't wipe your hands.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.823
We need to check 'em for gunshot
residue.

06:04.353 --> 06:06.501
- Yeah, I. I understand.
- You know the drill.

06:07.690 --> 06:08.963
What did I just say?

06:09.244 --> 06:11.630
- You can't wipe your hands.
- Okay, yeah, fine.

06:11.645 --> 06:13.882
All right, I'm sorry. I understand.

06:21.866 --> 06:23.063
Where's Santa Claus?

06:23.557 --> 06:24.573
There he is.

06:24.588 --> 06:26.316
Jerry, get a shot of the fat man.

06:26.331 --> 06:28.613
Make sure you get the blood.
The more blood, the better.

06:28.718 --> 06:30.734
Hell.
It's Brandy Barber.

06:30.811 --> 06:31.858
Who's that?

06:31.923 --> 06:34.258
She's a vampire with a press pass.

06:34.701 --> 06:35.991
Just stay away from her.

06:36.006 --> 06:38.336
Do not talk to her.
Don't even nod.

06:38.614 --> 06:39.694
Get him out of here.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.632
Now get the kids.

06:42.934 --> 06:44.168
Make sure they're crying.

06:45.286 --> 06:46.656
They're not crying.

06:52.028 --> 06:54.439
I am sorry about Santa Claus.

06:54.585 --> 06:55.917
I'm sorry he got shot.

06:56.481 --> 06:57.909
I hope he's okay.

06:58.489 --> 07:01.113
I hope...
he doesn't die.

07:03.819 --> 07:05.302
You're gonna make a wonderful mom.

07:05.357 --> 07:06.453
Just get the shot.

07:07.676 --> 07:09.456
Captain, nice to see you again.

07:09.811 --> 07:11.817
Gee, I wish I could say the same thing.

07:12.074 --> 07:13.251
That the shooter?

07:17.510 --> 07:19.971
- My god, it's Adrian Monk.
- Not gonna happen.

07:20.042 --> 07:21.211
He is off limits.

07:21.238 --> 07:22.975
I just want to hear his side of it.

07:23.382 --> 07:26.201
Adrian Monk just shot Santa Claus.
People are gonna want to know why.

07:26.216 --> 07:27.252
And they will.

07:27.387 --> 07:28.583
Just not today.

07:28.646 --> 07:30.003
He's a criminal!

07:30.329 --> 07:31.370
Murder!

07:34.131 --> 07:37.020
Look, can you give the guy a break?
He wore a badge for 14 years.

07:37.035 --> 07:39.092
I think he deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

07:39.237 --> 07:40.877
Captain, that hurts my feelings.

07:42.192 --> 07:44.616
Look, I'm a journalist.
I'm a professional.

07:44.643 --> 07:46.784
I'm not here to rip anybody apart.

07:47.674 --> 07:50.364
Tonight, crazy cop
caps kris kringle.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.188
Brandy Barber reporting.

07:52.732 --> 07:55.465
This city has seen its share
of shocking crimes.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.499
But for the children of San Francisco,

07:57.693 --> 07:59.853
what happened this morning
on that rooftop.

08:00.197 --> 08:02.088
Was the crime
of the century.

08:02.934 --> 08:04.902
The victim,
Michael Kenworthy,

08:05.017 --> 08:08.181
a doting grandfather,
a retired parole officer.

08:08.553 --> 08:09.780
His neighbors call him

08:10.192 --> 08:12.045
the nicest man they ever met.

08:12.227 --> 08:13.312
The facts are these.

08:13.422 --> 08:15.697
Mr. Kenworthy,
in the spirit of christmas,

08:15.876 --> 08:18.403
bought some toys to give away
to the neighborhood children.

08:18.564 --> 08:19.638
He was on that roof

08:19.653 --> 08:23.042
tossing Candy Canes
and stuffed animals down to the street,

08:23.297 --> 08:25.342
when this man,
Adrian Monk,

08:25.739 --> 08:28.170
a disgruntled former homicide detective,

08:28.298 --> 08:31.166
who was kicked off the force
on a psychiatric discharge,

08:31.300 --> 08:33.943
ran up to the roof
and shot Mr. Kenworthy

08:34.265 --> 08:35.441
for no apparent reason.

08:37.722 --> 08:38.808
I'm the grinch.

08:38.828 --> 08:40.260
That's what they're calling me.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.673
The whole city hates me.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.164
I think we're going to be okay.
I've been thinking about this.

08:44.179 --> 08:45.311
It's San Francisco.

08:45.326 --> 08:46.452
It's a godless town.

08:46.467 --> 08:48.284
Everybody knows that.
That's why they visit.

08:48.504 --> 08:50.355
Hippies and heathens despise christmas.

08:50.370 --> 08:52.589
All need is a couple of witches
on the jury, home free.

08:52.604 --> 08:54.769
- That's your strategy?
- That's just the beginning.

08:55.558 --> 08:56.793
How's it going, Randy?

08:57.033 --> 08:58.094
Almost done.

08:58.619 --> 09:02.608
We recovered these on the street
and these were from the toy bag.

09:02.623 --> 09:04.643
We've got 24 dolls,

09:04.658 --> 09:07.226
one rubber snake, five frisbees,
one walkie talkie,

09:07.241 --> 09:09.530
and 37 stuffed animals.

09:09.545 --> 09:11.483
I don't know whether to count
the bunny or not.

09:11.522 --> 09:13.135
- It's got blood all over it.
- Gray.

09:13.150 --> 09:14.212
Blood on the Bunny.

09:14.264 --> 09:16.340
That's not good.
Most heathens love Bunnies.

09:16.355 --> 09:17.904
I'll have to find one that doesn't.

09:18.710 --> 09:20.087
Okay, finish it later.

09:20.119 --> 09:22.471
All right pal, it's the moment of truth.
Have a seat.

09:28.603 --> 09:31.913
It is December 19th, 3:45 pm.

09:31.928 --> 09:33.462
I am interviewing Adrian Monk.

09:33.754 --> 09:36.539
Garret Price for Mr. Monk
and I have 3:46 pm.

09:37.309 --> 09:38.312
Go.

09:38.622 --> 09:39.885
What happened on the roof?

09:40.762 --> 09:42.588
When I got up there,
that guy.

09:42.603 --> 09:43.604
Santa Claus.

09:43.619 --> 09:45.487
- Mr. Kenworthy.
- Kenworthy.

09:45.727 --> 09:49.103
He was standing near the edge.
He was throwing the toys off the roof.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.017
<i>I asked him to stop.</i>

09:52.446 --> 09:55.354
<i>He told me to leave him alone.
He said my head was made of</i>

09:55.407 --> 09:56.410
<i>B.M.</i>

09:57.434 --> 09:59.395
Right.
Go on.

09:59.434 --> 10:02.205
As I was about to leave,
a gun fell out of his belt.

10:06.499 --> 10:07.630
<i>I asked him about it.</i>

10:07.645 --> 10:09.634
<i>Did he have a permit? He went nuts.</i>

10:11.596 --> 10:13.197
<i>He grab a pipe.</i>

10:13.380 --> 10:14.884
<i>He came at me.</i>

10:18.738 --> 10:20.012
<i>I told him to stop...</i>

10:20.307 --> 10:22.362
<i>Don't.
Don't try it!</i>

10:22.472 --> 10:23.823
<i>He just kept coming.</i>

10:26.937 --> 10:27.959
How many shots?

10:28.572 --> 10:29.575
Two.

10:31.188 --> 10:32.269
And is this the gun?

10:33.269 --> 10:34.272
You're sure?

10:34.311 --> 10:35.820
I remember the broken handle.

10:36.110 --> 10:38.107
Mr. Kenworthy said it's not his gun.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.073
He said that you went nuts
and that you started yelling, cursing.

10:41.528 --> 10:42.948
Then you pulled out this gun.

10:43.049 --> 10:44.168
You started shooting.

10:44.595 --> 10:47.128
- Can you explain that?
- Yes, I can. He's lying.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.347
We got your prints off the weapon,
Monk, not his.

10:50.362 --> 10:51.531
He was wearing gloves.

10:51.863 --> 10:52.924
Santa Claus gloves.

10:53.252 --> 10:54.255
If I may,

10:54.891 --> 10:56.000
what about the bomb?

10:57.701 --> 10:58.704
What bomb?

11:00.154 --> 11:01.929
You remember.
You told me there was a bomb.

11:02.668 --> 11:04.297
That Mr. Kenworthy had a bomb.

11:04.451 --> 11:05.454
He had a bomb.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.540
- He didn't have a bomb.
- Go along with it.

11:09.952 --> 11:11.341
He was waving something around.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.432
You thought it was a bomb.
It looked like a bomb.

11:13.456 --> 11:15.482
He thought it was a bomb.
That's why you shot him!

11:15.519 --> 11:16.932
He's a hero. You're a hero.

11:17.801 --> 11:18.989
Yeah, there was no bomb.

11:19.004 --> 11:20.162
Therewasa bomb.

11:20.351 --> 11:21.412
There was no bomb.

11:21.450 --> 11:22.820
Why are you protecting him?

11:25.350 --> 11:28.070
May I speak with my client for a moment?
By all means.

11:30.268 --> 11:32.473
First you don't like hippies.
Now you don't like bombs.

11:32.488 --> 11:34.119
Juries love bombs. Just try it out.

11:34.134 --> 11:37.153
Just see how it feels. It was a gun.
Everybody today likes bombs.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.955
No jury will acquit you if
there's a bomb.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.778
Pending further investigation,
we are not certain

11:53.291 --> 11:55.132
there was a bomb but we're pretty sure.

11:59.974 --> 12:01.645
What? I'm gonna talk to your client.

12:01.660 --> 12:03.440
I don't think that's a good idea.

12:04.053 --> 12:05.654
But I understand that it's procedure.

12:11.632 --> 12:13.002
Monk, I just spoke to Natalie.

12:13.017 --> 12:14.662
I know you've been under lot of stress.

12:14.677 --> 12:16.078
- Leland.
- I know...

12:16.571 --> 12:17.978
it's been ten years.

12:18.409 --> 12:20.339
It's the anniversary of Trudy.

12:21.014 --> 12:22.955
And we both know that you black
out sometimes.

12:22.970 --> 12:25.560
- But I did not black out.
- Look, I have to be sure here.

12:26.050 --> 12:29.599
Do you understand my position here?
It's your word against Santa Claus.

12:29.626 --> 12:31.343
Leland, it was his gun.

12:31.978 --> 12:34.196
It was self defense.

12:34.878 --> 12:37.423
I'll speak to you later today.
Think about the bomb.

12:41.204 --> 12:43.015
Tomorrow
I want to go to nursery schools,

12:43.030 --> 12:44.964
kindergartens, and talk to some kids.

12:45.196 --> 12:47.880
"What do you think, Timmy?
Will christmas ever be the same?"

12:48.952 --> 12:51.287
Maybe they're having nightmares.
Wouldn't that be great?

12:51.350 --> 12:54.209
I thought we were doing that
museum piece. That diamond from Egypt.

12:54.545 --> 12:57.152
We can do the Museum anytime, Jerry.
This is the story.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.179
Cop shoots Santa Claus.

12:59.205 --> 13:00.721
I feel like I won the damn lottery.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.066
Brandy, line two.

13:02.235 --> 13:03.256
I'm not here.

13:03.361 --> 13:05.414
He said it's about that cop,
Adrian Monk.

13:12.552 --> 13:14.230
- Brandy Barber.
- How you doing?

13:14.536 --> 13:17.401
- I saw your story tonight on the news.
- Great, thanks for watching.

13:17.416 --> 13:19.172
<i>Anyway,
I thought you might be interested.</i>

13:19.187 --> 13:21.135
<i>I live near that crazy cop Monk,</i>

13:21.370 --> 13:22.624
the one that shot Santa.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.013
Terrible thing.

13:24.123 --> 13:25.782
I don't know what the world's coming to.

13:25.830 --> 13:27.412
Yes, sir. It's a real shame.

13:27.460 --> 13:28.618
What can I do for you?

13:28.701 --> 13:29.790
I just saw him.

13:30.042 --> 13:31.054
Monk.

13:31.190 --> 13:32.968
He was in the yard behind our building.

13:33.754 --> 13:35.056
I could tell he was nervous.

13:35.071 --> 13:36.192
He was pacing around.

13:36.306 --> 13:37.327
He had a shovel.

13:37.495 --> 13:38.498
Shovel?

13:39.988 --> 13:41.461
That's Monk's building.

13:41.504 --> 13:43.799
The guy said at the blue doorway

13:44.166 --> 13:45.478
go 20 feet to the right.

13:48.544 --> 13:49.818
In front of the bench.

13:49.987 --> 13:51.627
- Fresh dirt.
- Dig.

13:55.109 --> 13:56.112
Dig.

14:07.891 --> 14:09.762
It's a piece of a gun handle?

14:10.489 --> 14:11.626
No, it's not.

14:12.245 --> 14:14.020
It'sthepiece of the gun handle.

14:14.857 --> 14:15.899
We got him.

14:22.568 --> 14:24.533
Please don't put your fingerprints
on the tape.

14:24.548 --> 14:25.556
That's.

14:25.634 --> 14:28.237
That piece of tape
has your fingerprint on it.

14:28.384 --> 14:30.056
Don't touch the sticky part.

14:30.071 --> 14:32.687
Here we go, 16" collar, 33" long.

14:33.386 --> 14:34.460
For your boyfriend?

14:35.026 --> 14:36.112
No, my boss.

14:38.095 --> 14:40.738
Do you have any "inspected by number 8"?

14:42.289 --> 14:43.504
We're kidding, right?

14:43.562 --> 14:44.565
No, we're not.

14:44.598 --> 14:45.939
- I wish we were.
- You now.

14:46.117 --> 14:47.815
No...
no, the tape--

14:47.905 --> 14:49.757
- Now that tape. That tape.
- I know.

14:50.326 --> 14:51.348
I know.

14:51.632 --> 14:53.207
The tape has to be even.

14:53.222 --> 14:54.942
Right, but the snowflakes on the back.

14:54.957 --> 14:57.643
- They have to line up.
- Yes, sir. I know.

14:59.557 --> 15:00.560
Do you...

15:00.631 --> 15:02.490
- wanna wrap it yourself?
- No, no, no, no.

15:02.541 --> 15:04.607
You do it. You're doing fine.

15:04.638 --> 15:06.972
You're doing a great job,
except for the other side.

15:08.827 --> 15:10.467
It's the man who shot Santa Claus.

15:10.545 --> 15:11.757
He's right over there.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.199
He shot Santa Claus.

15:14.251 --> 15:16.516
You know, I think it's...

15:17.013 --> 15:21.157
The snowflakes are all even in the bow.
It's right the middle.

15:21.431 --> 15:23.426
You call that the middle?

15:23.585 --> 15:26.998
What I would like is for you to twist
the ribbon to the left.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.374
Thank you, I'm in a hurry.

15:28.389 --> 15:30.595
- The left side of the bow. You're not.
- Yes sir.

15:30.653 --> 15:33.698
- We're going. We're going.
- We're almost done here.

15:33.735 --> 15:35.227
Now the bow's completely lopsided.

15:35.242 --> 15:36.824
Yeah, the bow's perfect. We gotta go.

15:41.010 --> 15:42.014
Hello.

15:44.186 --> 15:45.744
Why'd you do it, mister?

15:45.843 --> 15:47.656
Why'd you shoot Santa Claus?

15:48.472 --> 15:51.332
No-no-no, sweetie. It wasn't
like that.

15:52.681 --> 15:54.764
The grand jury is about to convene.

15:54.974 --> 15:56.604
You know what a grand jury is?

15:56.844 --> 15:58.012
Sweetie, here.

15:58.112 --> 15:59.683
- He doesn't know.
- I got a tissue.

15:59.698 --> 16:01.169
Why don't you just go home?

16:01.417 --> 16:02.844
You're upsetting the children.

16:05.410 --> 16:07.551
- Merry christmas, lad.
- Merry christmas.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.681
Thank you.

16:08.696 --> 16:10.669
Excuse me again.
Excuse me.

16:11.610 --> 16:13.617
Sorry.
Thank. Thank you all.

16:23.542 --> 16:26.147
I'm sorry. I'm.
Okay, merry.

16:28.523 --> 16:29.699
You're a monster!

16:29.892 --> 16:31.841
You're ruining christmas for everybody!

16:32.230 --> 16:34.217
He was. He was like that, I swear.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.578
Mr. Monk, we gotta keep moving.

16:39.144 --> 16:41.404
They think I'm a monster.
Did you see their faces?

16:41.470 --> 16:43.877
- They hate me.
- No, Mr. Monk, they don't hate you.

16:43.892 --> 16:44.929
Not really.

16:46.036 --> 16:47.329
That's definitely the guy.

16:47.624 --> 16:48.646
I now it!

16:48.988 --> 16:51.784
Let's keep walking.
I think one of 'em had a rope.

16:51.799 --> 16:53.041
I can't live like this.

16:53.219 --> 16:54.793
The trial could be a year away.

16:54.808 --> 16:56.838
I have to tell them my side
of the story.

16:56.853 --> 16:58.821
No, Mr. Monk.
I've heard your side of the story

16:58.836 --> 17:01.012
and I love you,
and I don't think it's a good idea.

17:01.027 --> 17:02.897
This is just a P.R.
Problem.

17:03.112 --> 17:06.455
When your dad sold that tainted
toothpaste from China, what did he do?

17:07.579 --> 17:11.157
He went on the news and he told his side
of the story. He took the offensive.

17:11.670 --> 17:13.367
I can be as offensive as your father.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.660
I'm sure you can.

17:14.963 --> 17:16.623
You know, that woman Brandy Barber,

17:17.063 --> 17:18.511
she's, she's Been calling me.

17:18.762 --> 17:20.896
She wants me to do her show.
I think I'm gonna do it.

17:20.911 --> 17:22.733
No no, Mr. Monk.
I've seen her show.

17:22.790 --> 17:25.832
She's not a real journalist.
She'll rip you apart!

17:26.737 --> 17:27.737
Natalie.

17:29.199 --> 17:30.766
You're forgetting one thing.

17:30.979 --> 17:31.979
The truth.

17:32.230 --> 17:34.236
See, I have the truth on my side.

17:36.419 --> 17:37.432
My god.

17:39.870 --> 17:40.893
Merry christmas.

17:49.749 --> 17:51.177
You gotta unbutton the shirt.

17:51.215 --> 17:52.771
No, I'm good.

17:52.786 --> 17:54.112
I'll just hold it.

17:54.594 --> 17:55.597
Like Sinatra.

17:55.914 --> 17:57.322
You gotta unbutton the shirt.

17:58.108 --> 17:59.111
No, really.

17:59.241 --> 18:01.226
I'm, I'm really not
comfortable unbuttoning.

18:01.241 --> 18:02.259
Brandy!

18:03.591 --> 18:05.192
Okay, all right, all right.

18:05.355 --> 18:06.995
Look, it's unbuttoned, all right?

18:07.268 --> 18:08.599
Hi, excuse me, sorry.

18:08.675 --> 18:10.607
I've known Mr. Monk for a long time,

18:10.622 --> 18:12.410
and he really loves christmas.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.855
It's his favorite holiday.

18:14.579 --> 18:16.765
You know, he comes to our school
christmas pageant

18:17.054 --> 18:18.148
every single year

18:18.517 --> 18:21.681
- and he decorates our tree.
- He does. And here's the thing.

18:21.696 --> 18:23.386
He's just a little bit particular,

18:23.401 --> 18:25.319
just about certain things, so...

18:25.391 --> 18:26.701
Yeah, he's,

18:27.028 --> 18:28.360
- special.
- In a good way.

18:28.379 --> 18:29.566
- Yeah.
- Good special.

18:29.581 --> 18:31.646
So if you would mind just being like
a little bit.

18:31.685 --> 18:33.393
Little bit sensitive
that would be great.

18:33.408 --> 18:36.082
Don't worry Ms. Teeger. Know all about
attention deficit disorder.

18:36.097 --> 18:38.222
I did a primetime special on it.
Won a local emmy.

18:38.237 --> 18:40.293
- It's not a.d.
- It's not attention deficit.

18:40.308 --> 18:42.426
- No, he just has compulsions.
- Yeah.

18:42.441 --> 18:44.433
- You know, rituals.
- He's a big boy.

18:44.489 --> 18:46.013
Jerry, let's do this.

18:46.422 --> 18:47.760
<i>Everybody salon.</i>

18:47.856 --> 18:49.888
We're rolling in five,

18:49.934 --> 18:51.496
four, three...

18:54.078 --> 18:55.332
Adrian Monk, hello.

18:55.376 --> 18:57.325
Hello and merry christmas.

18:57.372 --> 18:59.516
Thank you for inviting us into
your beautiful home.

18:59.531 --> 19:00.548
You're welcome.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.803
Merry christmas.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.107
You've already said that.

19:03.942 --> 19:05.679
Well, you.
You can't say it enough.

19:06.290 --> 19:07.641
This is my favorite holiday.

19:11.682 --> 19:13.185
The tree.
Yeah, this is my tree.

19:16.353 --> 19:17.761
It's quite festive

19:18.530 --> 19:19.842
because that's how I feel.

19:21.675 --> 19:22.774
<i>Presents.</i>

19:23.255 --> 19:24.760
About christmas.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.267
<i>No, the presents.</i>

19:28.320 --> 19:29.478
Some gifts...

19:29.947 --> 19:31.472
For christmas.
Christmas gifts.

19:31.502 --> 19:33.169
Yes, we were looking at those earlier.

19:33.355 --> 19:35.979
They're all from your assistant,
Natalie Teeger.

19:36.315 --> 19:38.630
Well, no, not.
Not this one.

19:39.774 --> 19:41.088
This is from my wife.

19:41.337 --> 19:42.573
That would be Trudy.

19:42.588 --> 19:44.621
She died ten years ago, didn't she?

19:44.810 --> 19:46.281
And you still haven't opened it.

19:46.648 --> 19:49.396
That's
very unusual behavior, wouldn't you say?

19:50.567 --> 19:52.573
Would you like some cookies?

19:52.996 --> 19:54.599
- Yeah, so...
- Would you like some?

19:54.661 --> 19:56.494
We made some cookies this morning.

19:56.933 --> 19:59.109
- Festive christmas cookies.
- No, thank you.

19:59.233 --> 20:02.538
You received a psychological discharge
from the police department, didn't you?

20:04.006 --> 20:05.067
Yes. Yes.

20:05.202 --> 20:06.346
Mr. Monk,

20:06.623 --> 20:07.754
how does it feel

20:07.769 --> 20:10.108
to be the most reviled man
in California?

20:11.508 --> 20:12.510
Bad.

20:13.923 --> 20:14.926
Have you seen

20:15.296 --> 20:16.300
these?

20:18.530 --> 20:19.543
I.

20:19.708 --> 20:22.196
- I don't think "santacide" is a word.
- <i>It's not.</i>

20:22.485 --> 20:23.932
It is now, thanks to you.

20:24.669 --> 20:27.157
We've all heard Mr. Kenworthy's
side of the story.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.787
He rented a Santa costume

20:28.802 --> 20:30.794
and was on that roof trying
to give toys away

20:30.809 --> 20:32.938
in the true spirit of christmas.

20:33.786 --> 20:34.804
Merry christmas.

20:34.819 --> 20:36.217
You can stop saying that now.

20:36.410 --> 20:38.075
Mr. Kenworthy said you went

20:38.090 --> 20:40.296
up to that roof
and just started shooting.

20:40.599 --> 20:42.027
That's not what happened.

20:42.316 --> 20:44.197
Why don't you tell us your side
of the story?

20:44.289 --> 20:45.298
Thank you.

20:46.006 --> 20:47.482
Well, first off,

20:48.027 --> 20:50.150
I want to say
<i>to any children watching</i>

20:51.065 --> 20:52.261
I did not shoot

20:52.384 --> 20:53.985
Santa Claus.
That man,

20:54.472 --> 20:55.979
was not Santa Claus.

20:57.208 --> 20:58.944
There's no such thing as Santa Claus.

21:05.207 --> 21:07.021
No, that can't be good.

21:11.964 --> 21:13.237
You knew that, right?

21:17.152 --> 21:18.329
Here's the thing.

21:19.293 --> 21:20.613
That was not my gun.

21:20.677 --> 21:21.736
That was his gun.

21:22.042 --> 21:23.042
He dropped it.

21:23.057 --> 21:24.351
Then he attacked me.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.403
Is this the gun you're referring to?

21:26.576 --> 21:28.158
Where did.
Where did you get that?

21:28.323 --> 21:30.621
I'm a reporter, Mr. Monk.
I have my sources.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.264
It's a rather distinctive
weapon, isn't it?

21:33.522 --> 21:36.633
A snub-nose.38
with an antique ivory handle.

21:36.667 --> 21:39.059
As you can see,
part of the handle is missing.

21:39.098 --> 21:42.302
- Yes, it's broken.
- Which brings me to my final question.

21:42.688 --> 21:45.317
We received an anonymous phone call
from one of your neighbors.

21:46.058 --> 21:47.062
Which one?

21:47.840 --> 21:48.843
He didn't say.

21:48.901 --> 21:50.039
It was anonymous.

21:50.673 --> 21:51.785
He did say

21:51.849 --> 21:55.180
he saw you burying something
behind your building last night.

21:56.089 --> 21:57.227
Burying something?

21:57.418 --> 22:00.168
My producer and I came by
and dug it up.

22:00.593 --> 22:02.799
I have it right here.
We wanted to show it to you

22:02.814 --> 22:05.025
before we turn it over
to the authorities.

22:06.845 --> 22:07.848
Do you

22:08.061 --> 22:09.064
recognize it?

22:13.876 --> 22:15.053
It's a perfect fit.

22:16.615 --> 22:18.429
Do you still say it wasn't your gun?

22:35.379 --> 22:36.420
Mr. Kenworthy.

22:37.427 --> 22:38.643
It's Leland Stottlemeyer.

22:39.241 --> 22:40.245
Randy Disher.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.918
- We spoke at the hospital.
- Yes, of course.

22:43.005 --> 22:45.551
- Come in. Thank you.
- We thought you might want these back.

22:47.587 --> 22:49.149
So this is the north pole?

22:49.592 --> 22:51.334
It's not exactly like I pictured it.

22:51.467 --> 22:53.802
It's not the taj mahal,
but it's all I need.

22:55.328 --> 22:56.544
Everything's there.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.357
Except for one rubber snake.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.393
It's for my nephew.
I didn't think you'd mind.

23:00.831 --> 23:02.142
He doesn't have a nephew.

23:02.777 --> 23:04.583
- I have nephew.
- He doesn't have a nephew.

23:04.598 --> 23:06.597
Benjamin.
His name's Benjamin.

23:06.654 --> 23:07.756
He's nine years old.

23:08.278 --> 23:09.281
See.

23:10.953 --> 23:11.956
How's the wing?

23:12.787 --> 23:14.845
I'll live. Guess it could've been worse?

23:15.484 --> 23:16.487
Yep.

23:16.502 --> 23:19.134
I see you're still in touch
with some of your old parolees.

23:19.710 --> 23:20.790
Thought you retired.

23:21.085 --> 23:22.517
Well, I call 'em when I can.

23:22.637 --> 23:25.318
- They're good guys.
- Yeah, I know some of these good guys.

23:25.588 --> 23:27.788
Burglary, <i>Grand Theft Auto...</i>

23:27.846 --> 23:28.848
Attempted murder.

23:29.877 --> 23:31.642
I help 'em out when I can.
What can I say?

23:32.233 --> 23:34.298
Everybody deserves a second chance,
right?

23:37.795 --> 23:38.798
What?

23:39.564 --> 23:41.069
What were you doing up there

23:41.374 --> 23:42.821
Michael, on that roof?

23:44.305 --> 23:45.540
Givin' away some toys.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.271
What can I say?
I love christmas!

23:47.322 --> 23:48.339
Come on, Buddy.

23:48.907 --> 23:50.721
There's nobody here.
It's just you and me.

23:51.425 --> 23:52.717
- And me.
- And him.

23:54.274 --> 23:55.470
Is that why you're here?

23:56.170 --> 23:57.424
To accuse me of something?

23:59.476 --> 24:00.826
Why don't you take a hike?

24:01.159 --> 24:02.163
Both of you!

24:02.579 --> 24:04.913
That gun was found in your friend's
back yard, not mine.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.696
Yeah, that may be true.

24:09.316 --> 24:11.149
But here's the problem, Kris Kringle.

24:12.599 --> 24:13.899
Either you're lying

24:14.626 --> 24:15.957
or Adrian Monk is lying.

24:18.313 --> 24:19.392
Merry christmas.

24:38.865 --> 24:40.022
Merry christmas.

24:40.273 --> 24:41.508
Merry christmas.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.590
Thank god! That man has a knife!

25:01.628 --> 25:03.326
Yeah, I know.

25:18.340 --> 25:21.716
Well, apparently she did not go gentle
into that good night.

25:22.605 --> 25:25.067
We found this can of pepper spray
under her body.

25:25.134 --> 25:26.134
Witnesses?

25:26.168 --> 25:28.456
Couple of neighbors said
they heard some screaming.

25:28.471 --> 25:30.470
One said she heard a clanging sound.

25:30.753 --> 25:33.836
- Clanging?
- That's the guy! That's Adrian Monk!

25:35.731 --> 25:37.325
Crawl back under your rock!

25:37.340 --> 25:40.140
It's all right. Just ignore them.
Just pretend like they're not there.

25:40.187 --> 25:41.761
Why did you shoot Santa Claus?

25:41.776 --> 25:43.933
Hey, Monk,
how many reindeer you kill today?

25:47.558 --> 25:50.047
Okay, her name is Alice Dubois.

25:50.106 --> 25:52.340
She's 64, retired teacher,

25:52.461 --> 25:55.279
she lived here in apartment b17

25:55.294 --> 25:57.667
with a beagle and some house plants.

25:57.682 --> 26:01.099
She worked
part time in the macmillan Museum

26:01.283 --> 26:03.826
in the gift shop.
Hey! Hey, gimme a break!

26:03.841 --> 26:06.371
- I didn't shoot anyone!
- Randy. Randy, what are you doing?

26:06.391 --> 26:07.883
They're lumping us all together.

26:08.841 --> 26:11.407
So what do you think?
Wrong place, wrong time?

26:11.625 --> 26:12.705
I don't think so.

26:13.299 --> 26:14.619
No, he was waiting.

26:15.076 --> 26:16.116
Waiting for her.

26:16.488 --> 26:17.775
These cigarette butts...

26:18.453 --> 26:21.527
He was camped out here for
probably 48 minutes.

26:22.379 --> 26:24.154
- 48 minutes?
- Yeah, look.

26:26.098 --> 26:27.864
The ends are all smooshed in.

26:27.909 --> 26:29.291
I only see one match.

26:29.779 --> 26:31.103
He was chain-smoking.

26:32.161 --> 26:33.502
Eight cigarettes.

26:33.948 --> 26:35.935
Figure six minutes per cigarette.

26:35.957 --> 26:37.465
- 48 minutes.
- Yeah.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.730
How do you live with yourself, monster!

26:42.508 --> 26:43.392
Hey.

26:43.715 --> 26:44.993
Hey, who threw that?

26:45.905 --> 26:48.268
- Who threw that egg?
- Oh, my god!

26:48.409 --> 26:49.952
It's okay. I'm all right.

26:49.994 --> 26:51.936
I got it right here on my sleeve.

26:52.053 --> 26:53.905
- Who threw the egg? And right here.
- Yeah.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.350
And here.
And then I got some here.

26:56.792 --> 26:59.047
Is that gonna come out?
Is that gonna come out!

26:59.510 --> 27:00.679
Is that gonna come out.

27:00.694 --> 27:02.964
Who would bring an egg to a crime scene?

27:03.388 --> 27:05.009
You two wait across the street.

27:06.127 --> 27:07.361
Wait across the street.

27:09.396 --> 27:10.592
Cover them, protect 'em.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.080
God.

27:28.809 --> 27:30.488
Hey, those are my wipes.

27:31.078 --> 27:33.293
You can use them if you want to.

27:44.366 --> 27:45.369
What?

27:45.799 --> 27:47.131
- Brian.
- Mr. M?

27:47.169 --> 27:48.548
Do you have a cause of death?

27:48.563 --> 27:50.625
It's unofficial.
It looks like blunt trauma.

27:50.678 --> 27:51.881
Eight, maybe nine hits.

27:52.311 --> 27:53.814
- From what?
- You tell me.

27:55.773 --> 27:57.200
Something sharp and heavy.

27:57.971 --> 27:59.920
- Curved edge.
- Weird, huh?

28:00.436 --> 28:02.932
- Maybe a frying pan?
- Or a bell. A bell?

28:07.756 --> 28:10.346
- What is it?
- She was hit on the right side.

28:10.911 --> 28:13.471
So that means the attacker
was left-handed, right?

28:13.486 --> 28:15.044
Or his right arm was in a sling.

28:15.063 --> 28:16.066
A sling.

28:16.731 --> 28:19.799
Look, there's Candy Canes on the ground.
There's three impressions

28:19.814 --> 28:23.189
like from a tripod.
One of those charity collection pots.

28:23.350 --> 28:25.981
- Mr. Monk, what are you saying?
- I think I know who did this.

28:25.996 --> 28:26.801
Who?

28:30.562 --> 28:31.662
Santa Claus.

28:32.807 --> 28:33.986
- Who?
- Santa Claus!

28:34.001 --> 28:35.131
No, not again!

28:35.146 --> 28:38.016
No! No! No! No!

28:38.073 --> 28:40.234
No, Mr. Monk, please no.

28:41.305 --> 28:44.108
All right, ladies. Let's do it again.
From the top.

28:45.598 --> 28:46.614
How's the arm?

28:46.629 --> 28:48.466
We'll find a doctor
when we get to ecuador.

28:48.481 --> 28:50.480
Were supposed to be in ecuador
four days ago,

28:50.495 --> 28:51.963
sippin margaritas on the beach.

28:51.978 --> 28:54.228
We caught a bad break, a minor setback.

28:54.243 --> 28:56.268
I thought that was your job,
Mr. Mastermind.

28:56.283 --> 28:57.613
To anticipate minor setbacks.

28:57.628 --> 29:00.648
Well how was he supposed to know that
cop Adrian Monk was gonna be there?

29:00.663 --> 29:02.676
Would you forget about Monk?
It was a fluke.

29:03.185 --> 29:04.477
But the plan is solid.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.791
Thorn and me took care of the old lady.

29:07.363 --> 29:09.160
Yeah, she won't be coming
to work tomorrow.

29:09.212 --> 29:10.581
She had a death in the family.

29:12.106 --> 29:14.080
Carl,
did you call your boss at the museum?

29:14.138 --> 29:16.682
No problem. I'll be working
the gift shop 2:00 to 6:00.

29:16.697 --> 29:18.292
That's it then, we go tomorrow.

29:18.393 --> 29:19.898
Closing time, 6:00.

29:20.822 --> 29:21.633
Okay,

29:22.146 --> 29:23.157
I made a list.

29:23.404 --> 29:24.600
Did you check it twice?

29:33.198 --> 29:35.474
Adrian, you've got to stop
blaming yourself.

29:36.926 --> 29:39.080
What happened on that roof
is not your fault.

29:39.095 --> 29:41.665
If the man attacked you,
then it's self defense.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.055
Nobody believes me.

29:44.388 --> 29:46.433
My word against Santa Claus.

29:46.483 --> 29:48.034
But you think it was the same man,

29:48.049 --> 29:51.865
this Mr. Kenworthy, who killed the woman
in pacific heights last night.

29:52.812 --> 29:54.793
But you haven't told the authorities.

29:55.577 --> 29:56.484
I will.

29:57.112 --> 29:58.405
I. I will.

29:58.835 --> 30:00.107
Soon as I'm sure.

30:02.169 --> 30:03.828
What?
Are those toys?

30:04.525 --> 30:07.605
Yeah, I've been seeing
a lot of children this week ever since.

30:07.620 --> 30:09.167
Ever since I went on television

30:09.431 --> 30:11.109
and said there is no Santa Claus.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.024
How are they doing, the kids?

30:15.101 --> 30:16.182
The kids are fine.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.304
Children are very resilient, Adrian.

30:19.474 --> 30:21.844
Although I might ask you to leave
by the side door today.

30:21.859 --> 30:22.877
I understand.

30:23.779 --> 30:25.766
They hate me. Everybody hates me.

30:27.827 --> 30:29.247
I thought I was alone before.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.664
I didn't know what alone meant.

30:30.704 --> 30:31.736
This is alone!

30:32.405 --> 30:33.407
Now I get it.

30:34.055 --> 30:35.212
Well, where's Natalie?

30:35.598 --> 30:38.297
She's at Randy Disher's christmas party
with everybody else.

30:38.355 --> 30:40.184
- You weren't invited?
- I was invited.

30:41.498 --> 30:43.466
I just...
don't want to see anyone.

30:45.753 --> 30:49.351
Adrian, I know how difficult this is
for you. I was worried about you even...

30:50.562 --> 30:54.417
Even before all this happened.
I know it's ten years since Trudy.

30:55.927 --> 30:56.930
Trudy.

30:57.362 --> 30:58.655
Trudy loved christmas.

30:59.238 --> 31:00.898
Yeah,
you mentioned that.

31:01.609 --> 31:02.851
Every christmas morning,

31:03.240 --> 31:04.607
she'd set the alarm.

31:06.347 --> 31:08.354
We'd go outside and watch the sun
come up.

31:10.233 --> 31:11.332
Trudy used to say...

31:12.795 --> 31:15.631
Christmas
made the whole world seem softer.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.201
Softer.

31:17.635 --> 31:18.639
I like that.

31:20.030 --> 31:21.316
What about before Trudy?

31:21.331 --> 31:23.831
What was christmas like
when you were growing up?

31:25.259 --> 31:26.259
Dark,

31:26.782 --> 31:27.785
desperate.

31:27.895 --> 31:30.680
The pain was unrelenting,
thank you for asking.

31:30.695 --> 31:33.298
Adrian,
they can't all have been that bad.

31:33.948 --> 31:34.952
Pick a year.

31:37.301 --> 31:38.515
1964.

31:38.550 --> 31:39.899
'64, good choice.

31:39.922 --> 31:41.106
1964,

31:41.464 --> 31:43.528
mom was sick.
Dad was.

31:44.242 --> 31:45.246
Dad was dad.

31:46.214 --> 31:49.159
Ambrose locked himself in the basement.
He's no fool.

31:49.470 --> 31:51.992
Christmas morning, I got one gift.
A walkie talkie.

31:52.821 --> 31:54.365
Well those can be fun.

31:54.399 --> 31:57.097
- I had a pair of those.
- Not a. Not a pair.

31:58.706 --> 32:01.550
Dad said I only need one
because I didn't have any friends.

32:05.319 --> 32:06.569
Just one...walkie...

32:11.876 --> 32:13.015
One walkie talkie.

32:14.689 --> 32:15.500
What?

32:15.649 --> 32:18.292
I think I know why Kenworthy
was on that roof.

32:22.296 --> 32:23.299
I have to go.

32:23.679 --> 32:24.913
I have to call Natalie.

32:25.290 --> 32:27.633
I'll. I'll see you tuesday morning.
Merry christmas!

32:27.648 --> 32:29.300
Adrian, no, not, not that...

32:30.034 --> 32:31.916
- Door.
<i>- Bobby, it's him.</i>

32:32.200 --> 32:34.607
<i>It's the bad man. He killed Santa Claus!</i>

32:34.669 --> 32:38.373
<i>What are we doing here?
- I Hate that man!</i>

32:39.177 --> 32:40.178
I don't get it.

32:40.193 --> 32:42.794
What does this all have to do with
a pair of walkie talkies?

32:42.861 --> 32:44.000
Not a pair.

32:44.189 --> 32:46.613
Not a pair.
One walkie talkie.

32:46.628 --> 32:47.720
See, that's the key.

32:48.647 --> 32:51.174
I remember when Disher
was going through that big toy bag.

32:51.251 --> 32:54.963
<i>There was one walkie talkie,
but it wasn't one of the toys.</i>

32:55.084 --> 32:57.071
<i>Kenworthy was using it!</i>

32:57.399 --> 32:58.834
<i>He was talking to somebody!</i>

32:59.128 --> 33:00.923
So he was a lookout?

33:01.147 --> 33:02.683
No, no, not a lookout.

33:02.698 --> 33:05.320
He was dressed like Santa
and throwing stuff off the roof.

33:05.427 --> 33:07.372
A lookout is usually
a little more discrete.

33:07.422 --> 33:09.323
- Well, what, then?
- He was a diversion.

33:09.543 --> 33:12.870
He was stopping traffic. He was blocking
that intersection down there

33:12.885 --> 33:14.512
so the cops couldn't get through.

33:14.846 --> 33:15.676
Look.

33:16.365 --> 33:17.368
Oh my god,

33:17.395 --> 33:19.725
- the macmillan museum!
- It's three blocks away.

33:19.745 --> 33:21.873
They were robbing it,
or at least they were about to.

33:21.892 --> 33:23.206
The star of Bethlehem.

33:23.221 --> 33:26.367
- But I didn't hear about any Robbery.
- That's because there wasn't a Robbery.

33:26.387 --> 33:28.853
I interrupted them,
so they called it off.

33:29.436 --> 33:31.103
But I think they're gonna try it again.

33:31.180 --> 33:32.217
How do you know?

33:32.289 --> 33:34.661
Alice Dubois, the woman who was killed.

33:34.676 --> 33:36.531
She worked at that museum, remember?

33:41.943 --> 33:43.960
It's just a truck.
Somebody must've broken down.

33:45.970 --> 33:46.974
Oh, my god.

33:47.061 --> 33:48.700
Mr. Monk, he's using a walkie talkie!

33:48.973 --> 33:50.034
Call the captain.

33:50.384 --> 33:51.580
They're trying it again.

33:52.111 --> 33:55.005
We're rolling in five, four, three...

33:56.501 --> 33:59.125
This is Brandy Barber
at the macmillan museum.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.598
There's still time to see the star
of Bethlehem,

34:01.669 --> 34:04.023
the second largest diamond
in the known world.

34:04.067 --> 34:05.214
But you Better Hurry.

34:05.276 --> 34:07.379
It'll be leaving San Francisco
tomorrow night

34:07.424 --> 34:10.100
and heading back to its permanent home
in cairo, Egypt.

34:10.786 --> 34:12.918
Many consider the stone a holy relic

34:12.934 --> 34:15.666
because it was discovered 120 years ago

34:15.831 --> 34:17.065
on christmas morning.

34:18.121 --> 34:19.126
That's great.

34:19.945 --> 34:20.949
We got it.

34:35.308 --> 34:36.311
Thank you.

35:21.446 --> 35:23.240
Merry christmas!

35:27.781 --> 35:29.942
That's him. That's the bad Santa.

35:30.355 --> 35:31.859
Merry christmas!

35:41.235 --> 35:42.373
He's got the diamond.

35:42.947 --> 35:44.645
Call the Captain!
Call him back.

35:44.724 --> 35:46.422
Tell him to stop the orange truck.

35:46.522 --> 35:48.839
- Where, where are you going?
- I'm going after Santa.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.029
No, no, not again!

35:51.234 --> 35:52.873
Wait, Mr. Monk! Are you sure?

35:53.111 --> 35:55.503
I mean 100,000% sure?

35:55.898 --> 35:57.314
It's hard on me too!

35:57.725 --> 35:58.958
Come on, Jerry!

36:01.133 --> 36:02.137
Stop him!

36:02.473 --> 36:04.431
Stop him!
Stop that Santa Claus!

36:08.214 --> 36:10.066
That guy has a lot
of issues with christmas.

36:12.479 --> 36:17.109
<i>O/~ the first noel o/~
o/~ the angels did say o/~</i>

36:17.364 --> 36:20.851
<i>o/~ was to certain poor shepherds o/~</i>

36:20.928 --> 36:24.030
<i>o/~ in fields as they lay o/~</i>

36:24.410 --> 36:27.535
<i>o/~ in fields where they o/~</i>

36:27.660 --> 36:30.829
<i>o/~ lay keeping their sheep o/~</i>

36:31.155 --> 36:34.351
<i>o/~ on a cold winter's night o/~</i>

36:34.403 --> 36:35.406
<i>Stop him!</i>

36:35.636 --> 36:37.018
Stop him!

36:37.688 --> 36:41.044
Stop him!
He's not Santa Claus!

36:41.102 --> 36:43.055
<i>Well, of course he isn't.
How old are you?</i>

36:49.415 --> 36:50.722
<i>Come on, Jerry!</i>

36:51.735 --> 36:52.872
<i>Get a shot.</i>

36:53.259 --> 36:55.615
- <i>Jerry, keep up!
- I'm trying.</i>

36:55.908 --> 36:57.181
<i>Get the kids.</i>

36:58.020 --> 36:59.332
<i>Come on, Jerry!</i>

37:18.886 --> 37:20.293
<i>Shouldn't we do something?</i>

37:20.350 --> 37:22.302
You stop this fight, you're fired.

37:49.676 --> 37:51.277
You stay back, Monk!

37:52.832 --> 37:54.317
You stopped me once,

37:54.447 --> 37:55.971
you ain't stopping me again.

38:20.504 --> 38:21.642
<i>Get him outta here.</i>

38:28.558 --> 38:29.928
That's cool. Can I hold that?

38:34.570 --> 38:35.767
What's this thing worth?

38:36.330 --> 38:38.005
About $30 million.

38:38.493 --> 38:40.338
<i>The star of Bethlehem diamond...</i>

38:40.353 --> 38:41.414
You should hold it.

38:41.429 --> 38:44.171
A symbol of hope and peace
to millions of people,

38:44.392 --> 38:47.540
would've been lost to the world forever
had it not been

38:47.604 --> 38:49.442
for the bravery of one man,

38:49.457 --> 38:52.034
former detective Adrian Monk.

38:54.443 --> 38:55.824
Mr. Monk, Adrian.

38:55.839 --> 38:57.357
Brandy Barber, channel six news.

38:57.414 --> 38:58.445
Yeah, we rember.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.169
How does it feel being a hero?

39:00.991 --> 39:03.306
He's a
very bad Santa.

39:03.412 --> 39:05.276
Very,
very bad.

39:05.291 --> 39:07.554
Bad, bad,
bad Santa.

39:07.569 --> 39:08.815
Yes, we know that now.

39:10.011 --> 39:11.362
Bad, bad...

39:12.255 --> 39:13.211
bad, bad...

39:13.226 --> 39:15.523
We're going home now.
We don't have anything left to say.

39:15.545 --> 39:16.464
Bad...

39:18.516 --> 39:19.577
There he goes.

39:20.563 --> 39:22.012
Jerry, get a shot of him.

39:23.285 --> 39:24.852
That's a real american hero.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.877
That's the man that saved christmas.

39:29.653 --> 39:31.080
That's it.
We're clear.

39:31.567 --> 39:32.937
God, I need a drink!

39:34.816 --> 39:37.342
Come on Jerry.
I buy you an egg nog.

39:43.155 --> 39:45.374
Egg nog! My favorite!

39:48.422 --> 39:49.426
Want some?

39:49.794 --> 39:51.974
- Really?
- Yeah, you can try it. I'm here.

39:55.888 --> 39:57.196
What do you think?

39:58.201 --> 39:59.931
I don't think I like alcohol.

39:59.946 --> 40:03.005
Really? Thank you!
That could be my christmas present.

40:03.170 --> 40:04.340
What are you doing?

40:04.355 --> 40:06.086
Come on,
we're supposed to be cleaning up.

40:06.101 --> 40:09.216
I know, we started to, but,
everything looks so beautiful.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.440
Candles?
You trying to burn the place down?

40:11.909 --> 40:13.439
- What's that noise?
- It's music.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.333
Mr. Monk, come on. It's christmas eve.

40:15.352 --> 40:16.719
You can't put everything away.

40:16.734 --> 40:17.827
It's not real.

40:18.324 --> 40:20.084
- The boxes are empty.
- I know.

40:20.099 --> 40:23.136
Stockings are empty.
It's all pretend, remember? We just

40:23.194 --> 40:25.314
put it up for that stupid Tv interview.

40:25.329 --> 40:27.072
- But it looks real.
- And it feels real.

40:27.087 --> 40:28.813
You're feeling something then it's real!

40:28.828 --> 40:31.471
- I don't feel anything.
- I know, because you're not relaxing.

40:31.486 --> 40:32.839
Let's just stop.

40:33.019 --> 40:35.466
- Sit down.
- No, I,

40:35.798 --> 40:36.608
Here.

40:37.110 --> 40:38.422
What are you doing?

40:38.446 --> 40:39.770
Taking off your shoes.

40:39.785 --> 40:41.046
- Hey!
- Don't be scared.

40:41.061 --> 40:43.467
It's christmas eve, come on.
Look at the christmas tree.

40:43.806 --> 40:44.997
Isn't it pretty?

40:45.074 --> 40:46.769
- Wait, whoa-whoa-whoa.
- It's pretty.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.232
Listen to the music.

40:51.206 --> 40:52.583
It's nice, isn't it?

40:53.411 --> 40:54.644
You're home.

40:54.704 --> 40:55.896
You solved the case.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.948
You're surrounded by people
who love you.

41:00.635 --> 41:03.258
- We're so blessed, aren't we?
- Yeah, we're blessed.

41:07.636 --> 41:08.967
I'm feeling something.

41:09.416 --> 41:12.002
- It's Joy. You're feeling some Joy!
- I don't like it.

41:12.017 --> 41:14.631
Sure you do. It's christmas eve.
Just-just stop fighting it.

41:14.650 --> 41:15.772
Just let go.

41:15.885 --> 41:16.981
Enjoy, okay?

41:17.991 --> 41:19.187
Open up your heart.

41:22.275 --> 41:23.452
How do you feel?

41:23.977 --> 41:25.770
- He's smiling.
- Get the camera.

41:33.422 --> 41:35.082
Merry christmas, Mr. Monk.
