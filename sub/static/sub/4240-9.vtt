I'm sorry.
It's a Glee Club thing.

12:24.994 --> 12:29.331
It's not about a guy, is it?
Because I'm not ready
to have that conversation.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.000
Well, at least you
don't have to worry about
me getting someone pregnant.

We're doing this amazing
song for sectionals,

12:39.801 --> 12:43.637
a personal favorite of mine,
and Mr. Schuester won't
give me a chance to sing it.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.558
Why?
It's traditionally
sung by a girl.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.602
Well, you sing like a girl.
You know, in a good way.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.396
Look, Kurt.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.440
I don't know how
this music stuff works.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.776
I'm pretty exclusively committed
to my Mellencamp collection, but...

12:57.861 --> 12:59.945
isn't there more crossover
nowadays?

with no socks?

13:05.326 --> 13:08.662
Didn't that girl
from your high school just
join the boys' wrestling team?

13:08.788 --> 13:11.248
[Whistle Blowing]
Yes! Whoo!

13:12.584 --> 13:14.835
Yes, but her parents
had to sue the school.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.591

gettin' you down,
isn't it?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.018
Yes.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.770
You can't discriminate
against my kid
because of his sex,

13:33.855 --> 13:36.148
religion,
political affiliation,

13:36.232 --> 13:38.275
or the fact that he's queer
as a three-dollar bill.

13:38.359 --> 13:42.029
- And I won't accept it.
- This isn't academics
or athletics, Mr. Hummel.

13:42.113 --> 13:46.700
It's an arts program,
and Mr. Schuester's
judgments are subjective.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.911
You put on a blindfold
and listen to my kid sing,

13:48.995 --> 13:50.954
and you will swear
you're hearing
Ronnie Spector.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.582
Wait-
Don't try to backpedal
on this, Schuester.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.834
I was just going
to agree with you.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.462
I know this is gonna
be hard on you, Rachel,

13:58.546 --> 14:01.715
but I can't in good conscience
preach about the importance
of helping Artie,

14:01.799 --> 14:03.675
and then reject Kurt's request
out of hand.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.511
So you're giving him
my part?

14:05.595 --> 14:08.138
Now, I can’t just
give him the part.
That would be just as wrong.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.140
But I can
let him audition.

14:10.225 --> 14:14.228
What do you mean,
like a tryout?
All right, that seems fair.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.189
This is totally unfair.
You gave me the part.

14:17.273 --> 14:21.693
And I will give it
to you again if you can
sing the song better than Kurt.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.238
Okay, this seems like
a reasonable deal.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.907

this isn’t just some show...

14:26.991 --> 14:29.660

a flamethrower to this place?

14:30.912 --> 14:32.704

14:32.789 --> 14:34.748
Now, all of you are gonna judge.

14:34.832 --> 14:39.670
And in the spirit
of full access, each of you
is going to get a vote.

14:39.754 --> 14:42.089
Whatever singer
has the most votes
gets the part.

14:42.173 --> 14:46.385

talent, Mr. Schuester. It's
gonna be a popularity contest.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.104

in their wheelchairs,

Well, thank you,
Principal Figgins.
But actually,

15:55.872 --> 15:58.999
it's made me realize that
there's only one wheelchair
entrance in this school,

15:59.083 --> 16:01.418
and it's all the way in
the far end of campus.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.337
McKinley needs ramps.

16:03.421 --> 16:06.632
No way. Those are
what I call "lazy makers."

16:06.716 --> 16:08.634

able-bodied students...

16:08.718 --> 16:10.927

their proper exercise
by using the stairs.

Yes. What am I doing here?

to polish that's
gonna clinch us nationals.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.693

by your stunt...

16:26.778 --> 16:29.529
that I'm insisting
that Miss Sylvester do
the same with the Cheerios.

16:29.614 --> 16:33.200
- I beg your pardon?
- Cheerios is not
accessible, Sue.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.202
It's by invitation only.

16:35.286 --> 16:39.831
I want to see a squad
that reflects
our community's diversity.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.377
- Now, Glee Club
held open auditions.
- And everyone got in.

16:43.461 --> 16:46.213
Now that Quinn Fabray
is off the squad,

16:46.297 --> 16:48.715
you will hold open auditions
to fill her slot.

16:48.800 --> 16:53.095
And Mr. Schuester
will monitor them to make sure
that they're fair to all.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.971
Okay, let me break
this down for you here.

16:55.056 --> 16:58.975
There comes a point when
you've gotta stop seeing people
for what they look like...

16:59.060 --> 17:01.269
and ask them to show you
what they can do.

17:01.354 --> 17:06.566
And as soon as a cheerleader
rolls herself out onto
the field in a wheelchair,

17:06.651 --> 17:10.696
she becomes
decidedly less effective
at cheering people up.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.698
- It's just a fact.
- No, Sue.

17:12.782 --> 17:17.077

given other students the
fair shake that they deserve.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.822
So you don't want me
to audition for the solo?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.824
No, no.
Let me be clear, all right?

24:52.908 --> 24:56.452
No one pushes
the Hummels around,
especially cowards on the phone.

25:00.916 --> 25:04.002
Sometimes, I just—
I wish your mom
was still around, you know?

25:04.086 --> 25:06.546
She was better at,

25:06.630 --> 25:09.007
you know,
handlin' this kind of thing.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.050
You know, handlin' me.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.805
Look, congrats on, uh,

25:15.890 --> 25:18.308
you know, the cool "A"
or the high "C" or, you know,
whatever it was.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.935
High "F."
Yeah.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.779
There's your problem.
You just had
a bent push rim.

25:33.657 --> 25:36.659
Good as new.
Thanks, Finn.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.412
You're the only one who was
willing to help me.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.957
I'm really nervous about
the "diva off" tomorrow.
Don't be.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.627
You know,
I don't wanna win
out of charity.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.921
I wanna win the solo
because it's right
for the club.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.923
I really think that
the judges at sectionals...

25:50.007 --> 25:54.260
will find a female version
of "Defying Gravity"
much more accessible.

25:54.345 --> 25:58.431
But... I don't think
that's gonna happen.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.433
People just don't
like me.

26:00.517 --> 26:03.311
Yeah, you might wanna
work on that.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.482
I like you.

26:09.193 --> 26:12.028
- We need to talk.
- I'll get out of your way.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.864
Nope! You stay.
I need a witness.
Do you know what this is?

26:14.949 --> 26:17.742
Oh. It's just
a "past due" notice.
My mom gets 'em all the time.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.453
Right. But if this
sonogram bill doesn't get paid,

26:20.537 --> 26:22.455
it's not your phone
that's gonna get cut off.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.457
You will get cut off.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.292
You need to help me
with this, Finn,

26:26.377 --> 26:29.128
or else we're gonna go
our separate ways.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.801
[Sighs]
I'm screwed.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.388
Not necessarily.

26:44.645 --> 26:46.646
[Chattering]

26:47.731 --> 26:49.607
I know. I know.
I know, I know.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.819
Hey. Hey, guys.
Hey, guys, this is amazing.
[Girl] Hi.

26:52.903 --> 26:56.823
Puck found his Nana Connie's
old recipe. They're addictive.
Do you want one?

26:56.907 --> 27:00.076
No. No, thanks.
I don't wanna take one away
from a paying customer.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.953
Yeah, I know.
Sure.
Hey, uh—

27:02.037 --> 27:04.455
Nice work, buddy.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.541
These are so good.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.876
[Puck Narrating]
This isn't Nana Connie's
old recipe.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.212
She couldn't cook at all.
She was a diabetic.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.173
So the only sweets
she had in her house
was dried fruit.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.803
I knew I had to do something
to help Quinn out with our baby.

27:18.887 --> 27:22.307
I don't know what kind of stuff
you need for a baby
that's still in your stomach.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.892
Bottles, diapers—
That kind of thing, I guess.

27:24.977 --> 27:28.646
But my baby mama
was gonna get it all.

27:28.731 --> 27:33.026
To make sure that happened,
I used the two things
I know the most about—

27:33.110 --> 27:34.902
lying and crime.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.155
Is there a lot
of pain, Noah?

27:37.239 --> 27:40.199
[Mock Sobbing]
The doctor said the shark
fractured my spinal cord.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.577
This is why I don't
go to the aquarium.

27:42.661 --> 27:47.498
I'm going to give you
as much as you want,
20 cents on the dollar.

27:47.583 --> 27:50.251
[Puck Narrating]
I don't put in enough
to get you hallucinatin'.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.795
Just enough to give you
a wicked case of the munchies.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.882
That's why they keep
coming back for more.
Yeah.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.634
See? I told you
I'd make a great dad.

27:59.762 --> 28:03.097
Faster. Harder!

28:04.725 --> 28:07.810
Those better be
tears of joy, Becky.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.355
Faster! Harder!

28:10.439 --> 28:12.899
Okay, stop.
[Sighs]

28:12.983 --> 28:15.360
Becky, this is terrible.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.071
I've tried, Coach.
This is really hard.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.823
You think this is hard?
Try auditioning for Baywatch...

28:20.908 --> 28:22.825
and being told that they're
going in another direction.

28:22.910 --> 28:25.328
That was hard.
Hit the showers.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.414
Thanks, Coach.
[Giggles]

28:35.672 --> 28:37.673
Hi.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.970
Sue, you are unbelievable.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.056
And you are
a terrible spy.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.643
You might try breathing
through your nose sometime.
If you were a sniper,

28:48.727 --> 28:51.729
I'd have already
radioed in your coordinates,
just like in the Falklands.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.732
I'm not gonna let you
bully that girl, Sue.
Oh, I bully everybody, Will.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.901
It's the way I roll.
Yeah, but this is different.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.903
She's not like
everybody else.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.239
I want you to listen
to what you just said,
William.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.950
You're asking me
to treat this girl differently
because she has a disability,

29:04.034 --> 29:07.078
when actually, it seems to me
she just wants to be treated
like everybody else.

29:07.204 --> 29:11.082
Why are you doing this?
Because I know you,
and you're up to something.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.710
You don't know
the first thing about me.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.218
[Door Closes]

29:25.848 --> 29:29.559
Good luck.
I'm rooting for you.

29:32.855 --> 29:38.693
All right.

[School Bell Rings]

32:19.229 --> 32:21.564
Hey, wait up.

32:21.648 --> 32:26.027
I cracked open the piggy bank.
It's for you.
Well, it's for "it."

32:26.111 --> 32:28.321
"It" is a she.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.575
Cool. I told you
I wasn't a deadbeat.

32:32.659 --> 32:35.578
Look, Puck, this is
really sweet, but-

32:35.662 --> 32:37.663
I can get more.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.500
People call me a screwup
because...

32:41.585 --> 32:43.628
I think school's for suckers.

32:43.712 --> 32:46.297
But I got ambition.

32:46.381 --> 32:51.844
Get us a house,
some stuff, furniture.
We could be a family.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.931
Finn is
your best friend.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.933
He'd be pissed for a while.

32:58.018 --> 33:02.605
But then he'd realize he doesn't
have to deal with all this.
He'd bake me a damn cake.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.690
You stole from
the cupcake fund.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.068
No, I didn't.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.737
[Sighs]
Fine. I did.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.947
I made all those cupcakes.

33:12.032 --> 33:15.076
I'm all about
being a team player,
but my family comes first.

33:16.828 --> 33:21.791
I get it.
And... I'm sorry.

33:21.875 --> 33:25.795
I should've never
called you a Lima loser.
You're not.

33:25.879 --> 33:30.591
You're special
and romantic...

33:30.676 --> 33:34.178
and a good enough person
to realize that...

33:34.262 --> 33:36.889
we are not gonna
take money from a friend
in a wheelchair.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.059
Hey.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.606
Here.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.693
What's this?
I got a job.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.320
Excuse me.

33:51.405 --> 33:52.988
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.700
You need to hire my friend Finn.
He is clearly "handicapable,"

33:55.784 --> 33:58.828
and refusing to hire him
could be seen
as discrimination.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.455
My dads are gay.
And unless you want
the full force...

34:01.540 --> 34:03.624
of the American Civil
Liberties Union
coming down on you,

34:03.709 --> 34:06.711
I'd work something out.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.505
Gonna need to stay
in my wheelchair
as long as I'm working there.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.841
But... screw it.
It's worth it.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.095
Can I give you
a lift to rehearsal?

34:24.396 --> 34:26.480
[School Bell Rings]

34:29.693 --> 34:32.445
1, 200 bucks.
That's enough for
the short bus...

34:32.529 --> 34:34.530
and two cases
of Natty light
for the ride home.

34:34.614 --> 34:37.950
Ah. Dream on, brother.
[Applause]

34:38.034 --> 34:39.952

34:40.036 --> 34:42.163
I'm very proud
of you guys.

34:44.499 --> 34:46.751
Artie.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.753
Why don't you bring this
to Principal Figgins yourself.

34:48.837 --> 34:52.631
- All right, Artie.
- [Girl] Go, Artie!

34:54.801 --> 34:59.430
- What's wrong, dude?
- I really appreciate what
you guys did for me.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.725
But I'm not the only kid
in a wheelchair at this school.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.895
And I'm sure there'll be others
after I graduate.

35:05.979 --> 35:09.607
And I know how important it is
for all of us
to go to sectionals together,

35:09.691 --> 35:12.401
but I think I'd rather
just get a ride from my dad...

35:12.486 --> 35:15.738
and use this
for a handicap ramp
in the auditorium.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.033
Any objections?

35:19.117 --> 35:21.994
Well, it sure beats having
to carry him in every day.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.544
You think she has a brain tumor?
That can cause erratic behavior.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.881
All I know is that
she walked in unannounced,

35:33.965 --> 35:37.885
and she wrote me a check
for three new
handicap ramps.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.555
I just don't get it.
I mean, first,
putting Becky in Cheerios.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.183
Now this.
What is her angle?

35:44.267 --> 35:48.562
Why ask why?
Just enjoy the fact that you're
getting your bus after all.

35:52.484 --> 35:55.069
How's she doing?
Great.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.739
She asks about you.
She's been watching you on TV.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.908
I need to get here
more often.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.910
Oh, you get here plenty.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.496

36:05.580 --> 36:07.456
Your little sister's here
to see you.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.333
Hey, Sue!
Hi, honey!

36:09.417 --> 36:12.336
- My sister's famous!
- You got that right.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.630

Thank you.
That's for you.

like doing today?
- Can we read today?

36:23.265 --> 36:25.641
- Look what I have.
- Little Red Riding Hood.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.476

at the beginning?

Yes.
All right.

You ready?
Ready.

[Chuckles]

36:42.325 --> 36:45.953
"Once upon a time,

36:46.037 --> 36:49.790
"there was a little girl
who lived in the forest.

36:49.875 --> 36:54.753
"Whenever she went out,
the little girl wore
a red riding cloak.

36:54.838 --> 36:59.508
So everyone in the village
called her
Little Red Riding Hood."

Right.

37:04.139 --> 37:08.851
Oh, no! Oh, you're
so much faster!
You can't keep up.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.854
I can't!
This is so hard— No!

37:11.938 --> 37:15.441
[Groans]
No, this wasn't fair. You've
had eight years of practice.

37:15.525 --> 37:18.903
Excelling at
wheelchair races
is about my only advantage.

37:18.987 --> 37:23.657
It's like your stutter.
It's mostly
just a big hassle.

37:23.742 --> 37:27.745
This has been
a really fun date.

37:27.829 --> 37:30.539
But... I wanna
get out of this chair.

37:30.624 --> 37:31.999
Why?

37:32.083 --> 37:37.296
So... I can do this.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.727
I have to
tell you something.

37:51.811 --> 37:54.897
I've been faking it.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.732
Faking what?

37:56.816 --> 37:58.692
I don't have a stutter.

37:59.903 --> 38:03.614
I pretended to have one
in sixth grade because...

38:03.698 --> 38:07.409
I didn't wanna give a speech
on the Missouri Compromise.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.745
I was really shy.

38:09.829 --> 38:14.166
And it made people think
I was weird,
so they left me alone.

38:14.250 --> 38:18.128
And it wasn't until
I joined Glee Club
that I realized...

38:18.213 --> 38:21.674
how much I was missing.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.802
I don't wanna push
people away anymore.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.887
You understand what
that's like, don't you?

38:26.972 --> 38:29.723
No. I don't.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.060
I would never try
to push people away,

38:33.144 --> 38:35.062
'cause being in a chair
kind of does that for you.

38:36.690 --> 38:40.442
I thought we had something
really important in common.

38:42.862 --> 38:46.198
Wait.
Artie, I'm sorry.

38:46.282 --> 38:49.827
I am too.
I'm sorry now
you get to be normal,

38:49.911 --> 38:52.997
and I'm gonna be
stuck in this chair
the rest of my life.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.250
And that's not something
I can fake.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.716
[Tool Whirring Loudly]
Hey, Dad.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.801
What are you doing?
I'm makin' biscuits.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.970
What does it look like
I'm doing?
How'd the tryout go?

39:09.389 --> 39:11.432
They gave the part
to Rachel.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.434
I knew they were
gonna rig it!

39:13.518 --> 39:16.103
I'm goin' down to that school
and I'm talkin' to Schuester.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.272
I blew the note.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.025
I wanted to lose.

39:21.109 --> 39:25.070
Kurt, I stuck my neck out
for you, and you go
and you throw the game?

39:28.825 --> 39:31.243
Dad.

39:31.327 --> 39:34.038
I've known who I was
since I was five.

39:34.122 --> 39:37.750
I adapted.
Being different
made me stronger.

39:39.669 --> 39:42.838
At the end of the day,
it's what's gonna get me
out of this cow town.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.840
You never had
to do that.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.009
I can handle myself
just fine.

39:47.093 --> 39:50.471
No, you can't.
Not about this.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.850
That phone call yesterday
was just the beginning,

39:54.934 --> 39:58.270
especially if I get up
in front of a thousand people
to sing a girl's song.

39:59.773 --> 40:04.485
When I saw you right after
you got the call,

40:04.569 --> 40:09.156
and you were...
so hurt and so upset,

40:13.661 --> 40:15.287
it just killed me.

40:17.207 --> 40:21.502
I'm not saying I'm gonna
hide in the closet.

40:21.586 --> 40:25.589
I'm-I'm proud
of who I am.

40:25.673 --> 40:30.177
I'm just saying that
I love you more than
I love being a star.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.807
You are your mother.

40:34.891 --> 40:40.354
You know, she was always
the strong one.
Look, uh,

40:40.438 --> 40:43.941
you wanna help me
put a 195 on this bad boy?

40:44.025 --> 40:46.276
Let me change
into my coveralls.
