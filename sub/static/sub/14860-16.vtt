WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:06.083
So last month, to celebrate
our one year of dating bliss,

00:06.381 --> 00:08.122
big Dave surprised me
and took me

00:08.425 --> 00:10.336
on a Huey Lewis
and the News cruise.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.627
ALL: Aw.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.716
(CHUCKLES) Cut to seventh
encore "Hip To Be square,"

00:15.015 --> 00:17.552
Huey pulls me up
on le stage.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.841
You'll never guess
what happened next.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.134
(SINGSONGY) My top came off!

00:20.437 --> 00:21.222
She took it off.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.478
Ugh! Gross, Mom!

00:22.773 --> 00:24.013
She's a keeper.
Really?

00:24.316 --> 00:25.932
J Huey Lewis
and them thangs [

00:26.235 --> 00:27.100
(ALL LAUGH)
Yeah!

00:27.402 --> 00:29.234
So in answer
to your question,

00:29.530 --> 00:31.191
that was the second largest
crowd to ever see my hooters.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.151
Ooh! What was the first?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.191
Robert Bork's confirmation
hearing. The '92 Masters.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.609
You said one thing,
you said another thing.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.323
Oh, wait.
Ooh, is that the third?

00:38.622 --> 00:40.033
Cruise was third.
Okay, that was the third.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.117
Yeah. Speaking of
things hanging out,

00:41.416 --> 00:42.656
how about us, huh?

00:42.960 --> 00:44.826
We've got my dad here,
we've got Penny's mom,

00:45.128 --> 00:46.618
the whole crew.
This is great.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.037
| know. I don't know why
anybody thought it was weird

00:48.340 --> 00:49.375
you guys were dating
at first.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.460
You are great together...

00:50.759 --> 00:51.965
Jay and Bey great.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.126
Don't know what that is.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.010
She means Jay-Z and Beyonce.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.797
Not my friend Jay
in the Chesapeake Bay...

00:58.100 --> 00:58.430
(CLENCHED TEETH) 'Cause
that's where he drowned.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.886
RIP, Jay.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.176
Embraced by the tide
and called home to hell.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.604
Any-Bay...

01:05.899 --> 01:07.981
What are we gonna do with this big
group tomorrow, huh? (CHUCKLES)

01:08.277 --> 01:09.733
A little 4-on-4 hoops?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.610
Maybe an 8-person party bike?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.111
Chinese New Year dragon?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.273
Well, actually,
we're taking Penny and Dave

01:15.576 --> 01:17.158
to that "TV robots
through the ages” exhibit...

01:17.452 --> 01:19.034
Yeah.
At the museum of science.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.366
It covers all the greats. They
got Rosie from "The Jetsons,”

01:21.665 --> 01:23.451
K..T.T. from "Knight
Rider," Angie Harmon.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.161
What about this foursome
over here, huh?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.042
Jane? Brad? Alex?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.374
What are we gonna do?
4-person mini dragon?

01:29.673 --> 01:32.290
Uh, we would love to,
but we have to go to a bris.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.755
A what? It is a Jewish
circumcision party.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.384
(GASPS)
Don't worry.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.636
Only the baby
gets circumcised.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.921
All right, well, have fun.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.214
(UNDER BREATH)
And mind your groin.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.382
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Okay, so everybody's got...

01:43.312 --> 01:45.804
(NORMAL VOICE) Got stuff to do.
That's... That's good. That's good.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.267
We'll put a pin in it,
and then...

01:47.566 --> 01:49.853
And then we'll all...
Get...

01:50.152 --> 01:52.143
Get back together w-when...when
everyone's schedule permits.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.652
This is not a great color
on you.

01:53.947 --> 01:54.982
Well, I think
it's adorable

01:55.282 --> 01:56.898
how much time
you guys spend together.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.861
You're practically
attached at the hip,

01:59.161 --> 02:00.572
like those conjoined
German prostitutes

02:00.871 --> 02:01.531
| saw on "Real Sports."

02:02.581 --> 02:04.071
They're also power lifters.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.489
| wouldn't say we spend
that much time together.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.533
| mean, just breakfast

02:07.836 --> 02:08.792
four or five times a week
before work.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.452
And drinks during the day
most days.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.872
Not every day, but
definitely every evening.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.007
And, sure, we always
deliver news in person.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.758
You know, maybe we
should review that policy.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.636
Jane, did you hear
who Max hooked up with?

02:18.930 --> 02:20.591
A guy named Jorsh.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.973
Um, can it wait?

02:23.268 --> 02:25.350
Jane! Did you hear
what I... Oh. (GASPS)

02:25.646 --> 02:28.684
Dear Jorsh.
That thing is no joke.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.690
| still don't know why you
felt the need to read my chart.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.568
Jane, they say you should
always get a second opinion.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.945
Mine just happens to be gross.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.277
Yeah, it is.
BRAD: You got that right.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.782
J But it feels so good [
On!

02:52.464 --> 02:53.920
Are we terrible people
for lying

02:54.216 --> 02:55.206
and saying that
we were going to a bris?

02:55.509 --> 02:56.590
No. We're not
terrible people.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.592
We need some couple time
away from the group.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.924
If we get into this tennis
club, it could be our thing.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.180
Like how making love out of
nothing at all is Air Supply's thing.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.591
Yeah, like how being terrified of
a dunk contest is Lebron's thing.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.259
Exactly.
(LAUGHS)

03:07.562 --> 03:09.394
Yeah, you're right.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.397
Lying is the only way to
avoid hurting Max's feelings.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.525
Dude cannot handle
being excluded.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.154
Um, Max, when we said we're
going to Mexico for our anniversary...

03:18.448 --> 03:20.405
We meant just us.

03:21.910 --> 03:22.695
Oh.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.781
Come on, Danny.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.662
| can't believe
we brought him.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.745
| can't believe he won that wet
pants contest at Senor O'Callahan's.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.909
Don't worry.
A bris is a great lie.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.748
| was gonna tell him we
were going horseback riding,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.378
but I was afraid it would
come out that I ride sidesaddle.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.665
Aw.
ALEX: Shalom. Shalom!

03:37.968 --> 03:40.585
Hey, guys.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.549
What is up? We were gonna tag
along with you guys to that bris.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.010
Oh. MAX: Alex has
never been to one.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.969
Yeah. And I don't
remember my first two.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.851
Of course, the second one
was less of a religious ceremony

03:49.146 --> 03:51.262
and more of a horrific
jet skiing accident. Oh.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.226
Wait. Why are you guys
going to a bris

03:53.525 --> 03:55.482
dressed like
Venus and Jane Williams?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.484
MAX:
Alex, there is no bris.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.611
They're going to play tennis.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.943
The only question is...
Why would you lie?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.824
Yo, I ain't lie.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.234
Why would you lie to us?

04:05.537 --> 04:07.369
The facts did change,
but I ain't lie.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.154
You need to tell the truth.
Don't come at me like that.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.415
Wouldn't have to if you told the
truth. Don't come at me like that.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.371
| wouldn't have to if you told the
truth. You talk like that, for real?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.877
It's about honesty.
It makes me feel unsafe.

04:16.173 --> 04:16.878
It's about honesty between
friends. All right, okay.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.084
We're busted.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.500
Brad and I are joining a private
tennis club, and we didn't tell you

04:21.803 --> 04:22.634
because we...
We know how you get,

04:22.929 --> 04:23.760
and we were afraid
that you...

04:24.055 --> 04:26.672
That you would, um,
make fun of us. Right?

04:26.975 --> 04:30.434
Yes. Make fun of us.
That...was the fear.

04:30.729 --> 04:31.764
That was the fear
right there.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.930
Guys, come on. This is me.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.644
Of course
I'm gonna make fun of you.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.274
| mean, almost immediately,

04:38.570 --> 04:39.731
I'm in an area of what time
is your monocle fitting,

04:40.030 --> 04:41.270
Ambassador Goldface Von Cash?
(LAUGHS)

04:41.573 --> 04:43.439
(ALL LAUGHING)
Stop.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.358
And that's just
first blurt. Love it.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.866
Guys, we would've
totally invited you,

04:47.162 --> 04:48.402
but it's gonna be
really lame.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.740
| mean, we don't
even wanna do it.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.873
It's really just a
networking thing for Brad.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.250
Definitely
not your scene.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.956
Say no more. That
sounds horrible. Yeah.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.791
Agreed.
Hey, catch you after,

04:59.090 --> 05:00.171
if we haven't killed
ourselves. Am I right?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.083
No. Don't do that.
MAX: Okay, all right.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.251
Peace on earth. Enjoy your
tennis, Ambassador Goldface.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.669
You, too, Mrs. Cash.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.964
(LAUGHS) Oh.
That's so, so funny!

05:09.267 --> 05:11.224
(WHISPERS) Good save.
| think they bought it.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.681
| bet they think
we bought it.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.016
(SCOFFS)
Not our scene?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.305
You know what
that means, right?

05:16.608 --> 05:17.939
Those two richies think
we're not good enough

05:18.235 --> 05:19.316
to hang out
at a tennis club.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.942
They do?
Yeah.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.445
This is how groups of
friends fall apart, Alex.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.322
Pretty soon they're gonna start
doing all this rich people stuff

05:25.617 --> 05:27.358
and leave us poor folks
to fend for ourselves.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.992
We need to do something
about it.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.449
Yeah. Let's show that 1%
that the other 10%

05:31.748 --> 05:32.954
are just as good
as they are.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.740
(INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY)

05:35.043 --> 05:35.623
Exactly.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.294
What a fun family outing.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.330
Oh, what fun.
| know. It's amazing.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.249
They got the original
"Small Wonder" robot

05:43.552 --> 05:44.633
on loan from Crispin Glover.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.043
Wait.
(DOOR CLOSES)

05:46.346 --> 05:47.586
Robots collecting robots.
Am I right? (LAUGHS)

05:48.598 --> 05:50.214
Can I get anyone a drink?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.508
Ooh. Ooh. I have a lovely
homemade pear wine

05:52.811 --> 05:54.393
in the trunk of my car.
Let me get that.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.144
BIG DAVE: Well, uh, actually,
how about some champagne?

05:56.439 --> 05:58.055
Because we do
have some news.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.393
(WHISPERS) I knew it.
They're getting married.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.058
(LOWERED VOICE) I... Die.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.729
As you know, big David and I
care about each other very much.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.442
BOTH: And?

06:06.741 --> 06:08.948
And we're not getting any
younger. We're a little old.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.109
(BOTH HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
And?

06:10.412 --> 06:11.493
We're adopting a baby.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.119
(GASPS)

06:13.415 --> 06:15.076
Oops.
Uh-oh.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.707
DANA: I can see that you kids
are a teeny bit wigged out,

06:18.003 --> 06:21.837
but listen, we got so much
joy out of raising you both,

06:22.132 --> 06:24.874
that we've decided to do it
again... Together. (CHUCKLES)

06:25.176 --> 06:27.008
Besides, we're through
raising you.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.794
You're all grown up. Don't need
us anymore. Oh, no. (LAUGHS)

06:29.097 --> 06:30.508
It's over. (LAUGHS)
So... What do you think?

06:32.142 --> 06:34.304
What do we think?
This is great news.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.136
What flavor
are you thinking?

06:38.440 --> 06:40.898
Black, ayzsh,
original recipe?

06:41.192 --> 06:43.399
Dave, you wanna weigh in
on this breaking news?

06:43.695 --> 06:46.983
(CLICKS TEETH) Uh...
Well, I know on the outside

06:47.282 --> 06:50.650
| may look like a stoic
"just for men" box model,

06:50.952 --> 06:53.193
but on the inside,
I'm jazzed. Jazzed.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.486
That is the perfect word.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.496
It encapsulates
our excitement

06:56.791 --> 06:59.203
while simultaneously
referencing jazz,

06:59.502 --> 07:00.788
America's
one true art form.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.703
So, yeah. Congrats.

07:03.006 --> 07:03.791
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.127
Or, more purely stated...

07:06.426 --> 07:08.087
I Skiddily bop bop,
skiddily bop bop

07:08.386 --> 07:10.844
I Skiddily bop bop, yeah J

07:16.686 --> 07:18.927
(SLURPS) Mmm!
Good on ya, Chad.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.805
Like your style, buddy.

07:21.107 --> 07:21.892
Babe?
Mmm. Mmm!

07:22.192 --> 07:24.024
This place is amazing,

07:24.319 --> 07:25.434
especially the locker room.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.774
| mean, shaving cream? Heated.
Towels? Heated.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.359
Locker room attendant?

07:29.658 --> 07:30.648
(HIGH-PITCHED SINGSONG VOICE)
Heated... (CHUCKLES)

07:30.951 --> 07:31.611
When I pointed out
all of those lotions

07:31.910 --> 07:33.400
are full of toxic parabens,
but don't worry.

07:33.703 --> 07:34.943
| gave him a thick tip.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.237
Mmm, bet you did.
Well, I just had

07:37.540 --> 07:39.577
a pomegranate blueberry
quinoa smoothie,

07:39.876 --> 07:42.493
and let me tell you,
if there is one single oxidant

07:42.796 --> 07:45.629
left up in me,
| am a monkey's uncle.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.414
God, I hope they let
us join. Oh, me, too.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.333
Brad, Jane?

07:49.636 --> 07:50.922
Connie Kelly,
membership director.

Oh! (LAUGHS)
Oh, Connie.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.431
Welcome to
the Gold Coast Tennis Club.

08:00.730 --> 08:01.811
We are excited
to be here, Connie.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.347
Oh, and I'm excited
to show you around.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.515
Uh, just waiting
on two others.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.229

CONNIE: Brad, Jane,
this is Max and Alex.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.398
Lovely day for
tennising, isn't it? Oh, it is.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.782
Shall we begin?
Yeah.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.067
Oh, we shall. (LAUGHS)
Oh, we shall. (LAUGHS)

08:15.996 --> 08:17.452

08:17.747 --> 08:19.658
BOTH: Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

08:22.585 --> 08:26.044
Wow. So our parents
are adopting a baby together.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.001
| can't believe I'm not
gonna be the baby anymore.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.712
This is now officially
my worst nightmare.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.754
That's right, Jason Giambi
sex dream. You're out.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.888
| mean, they shouldn't be
adopting a baby at their age.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.264
They should be salting
their grapefruit

08:38.559 --> 08:39.721
and watching
broadcast television.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.385
And you know what
this means?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.929
We're the ones who are gonna
have to take care of this kid.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.770
I'm 30. How is a 30-year-old
supposed to take care of a baby?

08:48.069 --> 08:48.979
Well, you're 31
if you're a minute,

08:49.279 --> 08:50.440
but who's counting?
Hurtful.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.195
But seriously,
what are we gonna do?

08:52.490 --> 08:54.777
This is a bad idea. They
aren't thinking long-term.

08:55.076 --> 08:55.781
They're forgetting
that having a kid

08:56.077 --> 08:57.659
isn't all tickles and hugs.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.536
Yeah, I'm sure if they had
to take care of a baby

08:59.831 --> 09:00.662
for just one day,
they'd be like...

09:00.957 --> 09:01.788
(INHALES DEEPLY)

09:04.002 --> 09:04.867
No, thanks, baby.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.752
Mmm, exactly.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.379
Wait. And all
we have to do is ask

09:09.674 --> 09:11.915
one of our friends with
a kid if we can babysit,

09:12.218 --> 09:14.630
then we bring that stroller
meat around big Dave and Dana

09:14.929 --> 09:17.170
and remind them that
having a kid is a nightmare.

09:17.474 --> 09:20.182
Good idea. Scare 'em
straight. Mmm-hmm.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.592
Like that time we took Max
to that prison

09:21.895 --> 09:22.851
and scared all those inmates

09:23.146 --> 09:24.307
into getting
their lives together.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.596
Tough love.
Let's do this.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.938
(LAUGHS) Man,
if this court could talk,

09:35.241 --> 09:36.606

God done this to me?

BRAD: Come on.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.342
You guys don't
wanna join a tennis club.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.137

'Cause it's not our scene?

You don't think we're
good enough to rub elbows

10:08.441 --> 10:10.102

Sheryl Pflimfs of the world?

10:10.401 --> 10:11.436

if they have any Grey Poupon.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.357
Sure. And, Max, you look
like John McEnroe's fat cousin,

10:18.660 --> 10:20.401

10:20.703 --> 10:22.785

(CRYING) What am I doing
with my life?

16:24.567 --> 16:27.480
My mom's in a better
relationship than I am.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.316
And I'm wearing a perfume
by Shania Twain. (WHIMPERS)

16:31.616 --> 16:33.072
Wow, that was fast.
It's all cued up.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.778
You just sorta
have to press "play.”

16:35.077 --> 16:36.283
Damn it.
It's not working.

16:36.579 --> 16:37.865
(GIGGLES)
What if I insult it?

16:38.164 --> 16:40.997
Uh... Hey, baby. Way to get
all your meals from a boob,

16:41.292 --> 16:42.407
you tiny moron.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.200
He doesn't understand words.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.619
You're gonna have to use
a harsher tone.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.458
(MENACING VOICE)
Remember my face.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.122
Oh, you probably can't,

16:49.425 --> 16:50.790
because you don't have
object permanence,

16:51.093 --> 16:53.425
you bald bitch!
Ha ha! Aah! Aah! Aah!

16:53.721 --> 16:55.007
What the hell
is going on?

16:55.306 --> 16:57.468
(EXHALES) Good
question, Trish. Smart.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.724
| was just speaking to
little Eddie in a demon voice

17:00.019 --> 17:02.807
to see how he'd react to the hustle
and bustle of a commercial shoot.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.268
And I was crying because little
Eddie's performance moved me to tears.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.602
Wait. What are you doing
down here in the first place?

17:09.444 --> 17:12.563
What are you doing down here
in the first place, Trish?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.152
There was no food in the
waiting room, and I got hungry.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.281
(SINGSONG VOICE
UNDER BREATH) Told ya.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.907
Seriously, were you taking
my baby some place?

17:18.204 --> 17:20.241
What? No.
That's crazy.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.156
Hey, y'all!
Ready to split?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.074
Cab's waiting outside.
(GASPS) Oh.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.085
Oh. Is this the little
surprise you told us about?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.371
DANA: What a perfect
little baby.

17:29.674 --> 17:30.709
(EDDIE COOING) Maybe we
should just steal this one, am I right,

17:31.008 --> 17:32.464
or am I right?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.376
You are coming home with
me. (GASPS AND BABBLES)

17:34.679 --> 17:35.168
I'm calling the cops.

17:36.931 --> 17:37.796
Trish.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.347
So you and Dave

17:43.646 --> 17:45.432
kidnapped this woman's baby.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.096
Small Dave, is this true?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.562
It depends
how you define "true."

17:49.860 --> 17:51.817
If you mean the thing
that happened, then yes.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.353
BIG DAVE:
This is beyond unacceptable.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.488
Why in the world would you
do something like this?

17:55.783 --> 17:56.693
Um, to prove
how irresponsible

17:56.993 --> 17:58.404
you and big Dave are being,

17:58.703 --> 18:00.865
and I hope you learned
your lesson and stuff.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.404
FYI...you don't
teach us lessons.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.119
We teach you lessons.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.034
| don't care who is
teaching what to who.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.202
It doesn't change the fact
that I'm calling the cops.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.620
All right, ma'am, if I may,

18:10.923 --> 18:12.505
| think I know
what's happening here.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.632
My girlfriend and |
wanted to adopt a child.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.760
Let me back up.
| am his father,

18:18.055 --> 18:20.843
and |'ve been dating
this young lady's mother.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.634
Let me back up again.
The year was 1980.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.347
| was a sexually active
young buck

18:25.646 --> 18:26.807
with some notions
about birth control

18:27.106 --> 18:29.143
that were dead wrong.
Hey.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.728
Okay, I think what
he's trying to say

18:31.027 --> 18:32.108
is that
we're adopting a baby,

18:32.403 --> 18:33.893
and our older children
are freaking.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.982
TRISH:
Okay, that I get.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.397
You know when
| had Eddie here,

18:37.700 --> 18:38.986
my 8-year-old
totally acted out.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.992
Clearly, this one gets it.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.528
So, mama grizzly
to mama grizzly,

18:43.831 --> 18:46.289
what do you say we give
these cubs a pass, huh?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.245
| mean, they're just kids.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.376
Um... They're
easily 30, so no.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.786
31.
BIG DAVE: All right.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.705
Well, I'm gonna have to
handle this like a dad.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.373
Here we go.
Say when, Trish.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.633
| am saving for an ATV, so...

18:57.928 --> 18:59.009
New or used?

18:59.305 --> 19:00.010
New.
Yeah.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.714
Put it in my purse.
(CHUCKLES)

19:03.017 --> 19:03.552
BIG DAVE:
E-mail me the receipt.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.970
So...

19:09.273 --> 19:11.765
| guess you guys didn't
get into the club.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.561
No, we didn't. It's my fault.
I know. I'm sorry. It's just...

19:15.863 --> 19:17.570
| got all paranoid that
you guys would move on

19:17.865 --> 19:19.026
and start doing rich stuff,

19:19.325 --> 19:20.486
and I'd never
see you guys again

19:20.785 --> 19:22.492
'cause you'd be going all
Eyes Wide Shut parties

19:22.787 --> 19:24.573
and hunting people for sport
with Tommy Hilfiger

19:24.872 --> 19:26.408
or whatever rich people
supposedly do.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.698
Max, it's not about
rich stuff, all right?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.617
It's not even about tennis.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.957
It's about Jane and I having
something to do just for us.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.837
Look, we love hanging out
with you guys,

19:35.132 --> 19:37.248
but we need some couple time
to ourselves, too.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.541
Well, why didn't you
just say that?

19:38.844 --> 19:40.300
We didn't wanna hurt
your feelings,

19:40.596 --> 19:42.507
and you sort of freak out
whenever anyone tries

19:42.807 --> 19:44.389
to do something
without you. No, I don't.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.049
Uh, remember when Dave
had appendicitis?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.808
And you punched yourself in the
stomach so you could get I, too,

19:48.104 --> 19:49.469
but all you got
was red diarrhea?

19:49.772 --> 19:51.388
Point taken.
Advantage...you guys.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.183
Look, seriously,
I'm sorry, for real.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.441
I'm sorry, too.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.148
(SIGHS) Thanks.

19:58.447 --> 19:58.777
(CLICKS TEETH)
Let's just go, though.

20:00.282 --> 20:00.771
You're not going anywhere.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.278
I've got the perfect plan

20:03.577 --> 20:04.817
to get you back
into this club.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.202
| don't think
it's necessary.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.204
What? What is he up to?
| think...

20:08.499 --> 20:09.910
| don't know. He's got some
pep in his step. | don't know.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.199
Yes, he seemed very excited.
He's gonna turn it around.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.038
| think he is.
No, no, let's not...

20:13.337 --> 20:14.202
| don't think we need
to go that far with it.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.463
It didn't work! It didn't
work! It didn't work!

20:17.758 --> 20:19.294
It didn't work!

20:19.593 --> 20:21.550
What exactly
was his plan?

20:21.846 --> 20:22.961
It didn't work! Aah!

20:25.141 --> 20:28.429
So, listen, Dave and |
are so sorry

20:28.728 --> 20:29.934
we acted like idiots
and freaked out

20:30.229 --> 20:31.390
about you guys adopting.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.100
And honestly,
it's unorthodox,

20:33.399 --> 20:35.515
but if anyone can make
it work, it's you guys.

20:35.818 --> 20:38.185
You'll be great parents
because you are great parents.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.524
The best. That's mighty
sweet of you kids to say,

20:40.823 --> 20:43.531
but, um,
there is no way in hell

20:43.826 --> 20:45.942
we're adopting a kid now.
No!

20:46.245 --> 20:47.827
Not on my watch. Whoo!
Dodged a bullet on that one.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.533
(CHUCKLES)
Right, Papa?

20:49.832 --> 20:51.322
Yes, sir.
PENNY: Wow.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.491
So seeing little Eddie
in the lobby

20:53.794 --> 20:56.957
actually reminded you guys
how hard it is to raise kids.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.668
No, actually seeing you two
in the lobby

20:59.967 --> 21:01.833
trying to steal little Eddie

21:02.136 --> 21:03.843
reminded us how
hard it is to have kids.

21:04.138 --> 21:05.344
BIG DAVE: Yeah, and clearly

21:05.639 --> 21:07.346
we are not finished raising
you two dumbasses.

21:07.641 --> 21:08.346
(BOTH LAUGHING)

21:09.935 --> 21:11.801
(FORCED LAUGH)
Yeah.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.892
(LAUGHS) I think what big
David and | are really trying to say

21:15.191 --> 21:18.024
is that you two will always
be our babies.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.435
Aw!
Aw!

21:20.738 --> 21:22.649
(CHUCKLES)

21:22.948 --> 21:24.859
Then brush my hair and make
me chocolate chip penny-cakes.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.400
And tickle my back
until I coo and coo.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.819
Brush the hair of a
beautiful, beautiful princess.

21:30.122 --> 21:30.452
Tickle your tummy, huh?
(ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE)
