IN ALL OF MANHATTAN.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.276

00:15.215 --> 00:16.950

00:16.983 --> 00:19.052

00:24.190 --> 00:25.625
THE REAL ESTATE MARKET HERE,
IT'S CRAZY.

00:25.658 --> 00:28.395
- THIS IS RUDE.
- I THINK YOU'RE AN ASS.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.130
- EXCUSE MY FRENCH, BUT I DON'T
GIVE A FLYING [bleep]

00:30.163 --> 00:31.531
ABOUT YOUR RENOVATION.

00:31.564 --> 00:32.732
- MICHAEL...

00:32.766 --> 00:35.468
I LOST THE--YOU'RE--
I LOST THE APARTMENT.

00:35.502 --> 00:36.469
- AREN'T YOU GONNA
INTRODUCE US?

00:36.503 --> 00:38.438
- FREDRIK IS A SHARK,

00:38.471 --> 00:40.540
AND HE DOES WHAT SHARKS DO--
HE SMELLS BLOOD.

00:40.573 --> 00:41.741
- I WAS JUST THERE TO, WHAT,
BE YOUR BITCH

00:41.775 --> 00:43.643
AND SHOW PEOPLE AROUND?
- CALM DOWN.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.912
- I DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

00:45.945 --> 00:49.082
- I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO FOR ME.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.417
- I'M TALKING
THE PRIVATE NETWORK.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.185
WE CAN HAVE PARTIES
IN HERE.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.154
THIS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST SALE
OF MY CAREER.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.255
- 40, 50 PEOPLE.

00:55.288 --> 00:56.289
I'M NERVOUS

00:56.322 --> 00:58.324
ABOUT HAVING
SO MANY PEOPLE IN HERE.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.328
- 400?

01:03.897 --> 01:07.067
[techno music]

01:07.100 --> 01:12.806
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION,
ALWAYS, IN ALL WAYS.

01:12.839 --> 01:14.641
- I COME FROM
A REAL ESTATE FAMILY,

01:14.674 --> 01:17.477
BUT, YES, YOU CAN CALL ME
THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK.

01:17.510 --> 01:20.080
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.649
- WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:22.682 --> 01:23.750
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN.

01:23.783 --> 01:25.819
- YES, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.962
[crowd chattering]

01:35.995 --> 01:39.165
95 GREENE IS THE BIGGEST
PROPERTY THAT I'VE EVER LISTED.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.167
WHOA, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING, HUH?

01:42.802 --> 01:43.837
I NEED TO DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT

01:43.870 --> 01:45.305
AND I NEED TO DO
SOMETHING BIG.

01:45.338 --> 01:48.375
SO I'VE DECIDED TO THROW
A PARTY FOR FASHION WEEK.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.643
EVERYONE WE INVITED
COULD BE A BUYER,

01:50.677 --> 01:53.713
OR THEY'RE CONNECTED SOMEHOW
WITHIN A WORLD OF PEOPLE

01:53.747 --> 01:54.714
WHO COULD BE A BUYER.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.716
[glass breaks]

01:56.750 --> 01:59.252
BUT IT'S...PACKED.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.254
THERE'S PEOPLE THERE
EVERYWHERE.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.123
- THERE'S OVER 200 PEOPLE
HERE, SO...

02:03.156 --> 02:04.290
- THERE'S OVER 200 PEOPLE
IN HERE?

02:04.324 --> 02:05.592
- YEAH, I COUNTED THEM.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.627
TO A POINT NOW WHERE
IT'S TOO MANY PEOPLE

02:07.660 --> 02:09.629
WHERE IT COULD
GET OUT OF CONTROL.

02:09.662 --> 02:10.897
I WANT TO WRAP IT NOW.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.602
- KEN IS UNHAPPY.

02:15.635 --> 02:16.770
AND I GET THAT.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.705
BUT...THE ONE GREAT THING

02:18.738 --> 02:20.607
ABOUT HAVING
SO MANY PEOPLE HERE

02:20.640 --> 02:22.976
IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT
OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.377
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

02:24.411 --> 02:26.079
CASSANDRA, RIGHT?
- I'M ADRIANA.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.714
- KEN. HOW ARE YOU?
- PLEASURE.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.716
- THIS IS KEN, THE OWNER.
- NICE TO MEET YOU. HELLO.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.085
- SO IF I CAN JUST
DISTRACT HIM ENOUGH

02:32.085 --> 02:33.586
TO GET SOME WORK DONE,

02:33.620 --> 02:34.821
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE WILL CALM DOWN

02:34.854 --> 02:36.790
AND MAYBE NOT
THROW ME OUT ON THE STREET.

03:06.786 --> 03:09.055
THANK YOU, GOD.

03:14.761 --> 03:15.862
- READY?
- HI! YEAH.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.765
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

03:18.798 --> 03:20.567
- SO I CALLED YOU AND KIND OF
TOLD YOU WE WERE HAVING THIS,

03:20.600 --> 03:21.868
'CAUSE THIS IS KIND OF
THE UNVEILING

03:21.901 --> 03:22.902
OF THIS APARTMENT.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.204
WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANY SHOWINGS YET.

03:24.237 --> 03:26.706
- LET'S SEE IT.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME?

03:28.241 --> 03:29.542
COOL.

03:29.576 --> 03:30.844
VIEWS ARE COOL.

03:30.877 --> 03:31.911
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
BRING YOUR GUY BY.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.346
I THINK YOU SHOULD
BRING HIM BY ASAP,

03:33.380 --> 03:34.781
'CAUSE I NEED YOU
TO SELL THIS TOMORROW.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.583
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, HE'S
COMING IN TOMORROW, SO...

03:36.616 --> 03:38.218
- OKAY.
- WOULDN'T THAT BE INTERESTING?

03:38.251 --> 03:39.319
- LET'S DO IT.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.920
HAVING A PRIVATE SHOWING
ALREADY SET UP

03:40.954 --> 03:42.822
IS GREAT NEWS FOR ME
TO BREAK TO KEN.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.091
- SO HOW MANY PEOPLE
DID YOU INVITE?

03:47.127 --> 03:48.862
- 72.
- [laughs]

03:52.332 --> 03:54.100
- SO NOW YOU WANT
MORE PEOPLE.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.602
- [laughing]

04:01.174 --> 04:03.176
- OH, MY GOD, SO ARE YOU READY
TO HAVE YOUR FIRST SCHNITZEL?

04:03.209 --> 04:04.778
- WHAT IS A SCHNITZEL?

04:04.811 --> 04:07.180
- IT'S LIKE THIS HAND-POUNDED
GERMAN SAUSAGE.

04:07.213 --> 04:08.882
IT'S, LIKE, BREADED.
YOU GOTTA TRY IT.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.684
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD IT,
YOU KNOW, BEING FROM EUROPE,

04:10.717 --> 04:11.918
BUT I MEAN--
- SCHNITZEL BLITZEL.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.887
I'LL EAT ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.
I'M SO DAMN HUNGRY.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.155
- I KNOW, THAT'S WHY
WE GOTTA GET SOME.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.389
- HMM.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.824
- SO I WANNA TELL YOU
ABOUT, UM, MARCELLA.

04:17.857 --> 04:19.459
I MENTIONED TO YOU
THE OTHER DAY,

04:19.492 --> 04:20.794
I MET HER AT AN OPEN HOUSE.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.396
SHE GOT THIS AMAZING
DOUBLE-HIGH CEILING LOFT

04:23.430 --> 04:25.665
ON IRVING PLACE--BEAUTIFUL.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.901
- LOVE IRVING.
OKAY, WHEN CAN WE SEE IT?

04:27.934 --> 04:30.403
- UM, SHE SAYS NEXT WEEK'S
GOOD FOR HER.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.504
- I'M A MENTOR TO JUSTIN.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.173
I'M REALLY TEACHING HIM
GROUND UP,

04:33.206 --> 04:34.941
HOW REAL ESTATE
IN THE CITY WORKS.

04:34.974 --> 04:36.309
WELL, I THINK IT'S GREAT.

04:36.343 --> 04:37.844
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN DOING
REALLY GREAT LATELY.

04:37.877 --> 04:39.946
UM, BUT I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO TAKE ON--

04:39.979 --> 04:42.248
I MEAN, WITH MY HELP, OF COURSE,
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.317
BUT I THINK THAT'S A GOOD TIME
FOR YOU TO TAKE SOME WORK.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.086
- YOU GONNA LET ME
OUT OF YOUR SHADOW?

04:46.086 --> 04:47.887
- YEAH, NOT--YEAH.
NOT YET, BUT...

04:47.921 --> 04:49.089
JOSEPH IS NOT ONLY
MY ASSISTANT,

04:49.089 --> 04:50.790
HE'S ALSO A JUNIOR BROKER.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.125
AND I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE
MY ASSISTANTS

04:52.158 --> 04:54.961
TO GO OUT AND SET UP
LISTING APPOINTMENTS.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.896
BUT I WILL
GET THE COMMISSION,

04:56.930 --> 04:59.799
AND THEN I WILL PAY HIM
A PERCENTAGE OF THAT COMMISSION.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.401
both: MMM.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.269
- FRIED SCHNITZEL.

05:06.673 --> 05:07.807
both: MMM.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.509
- I THINK I'LL STICK
TO THE POTATOES.

05:18.918 --> 05:22.889
- 33 CHARLTON IS A SINGLE-FAMILY
TOWNHOUSE

05:22.922 --> 05:25.892
IN THE WEST VILLAGE
SOHO AREA OF NEW YORK.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.895
THIS TOWNHOUSE HAS BEEN FOR SALE
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.697
THREE OF THE BEST BROKERS
IN NEW YORK HAD IT FOR SALE.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.465
BUT THEY DIDN'T GO
THE EXTRA MILE

05:32.499 --> 05:34.067
AND FINISH IT.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.069
MAKE IT LIVABLE.
LOOKS GOOD.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.504
I THINK KIDS ARE GONNA
PLAY HERE ON SUNDAY.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.472
- WHEN THEY SEE THIS ROOM...
- THEY'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.907
- THEY'RE GONNA TELL THEM,
"MOMMY, DADDY,

05:40.940 --> 05:42.075
PLEASE BUY THIS."

05:42.075 --> 05:43.410
- I'M TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

05:43.443 --> 05:46.079
THIS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST DEAL
FOR ME THIS YEAR.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.817
SO YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE
EVERYTHING IS DOWNSTAIRS?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.952
THE KITCHEN?

05:52.986 --> 05:55.255
SO MAYBE WE'LL MOVE THIS.
YOU WANNA PUT MORE FOOD HERE.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.624
WHERE'S THAT PLASTIC THING
THAT GOES ON TOP OF HERE?

05:57.657 --> 05:59.793
THIS PROPERTY'S GEARED
TOWARDS FAMILIES.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.896
SO I'M TRYING TO THROW A REAL
FAMILY-ORIENTED OPEN HOUSE.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.564
YOU KNOW, THERE WILL BE
SOMETHING FOR THE KIDS

06:04.597 --> 06:06.399
AND THEN THE GREAT HOUSE
AND GREAT FOOD

06:06.433 --> 06:07.901
FOR THE ADULTS AS WELL.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.035
CAN WE GET SOME NAPKINS?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.570
I'LL GET SOME NAPKINS
TO LEAVE HERE.

06:10.603 --> 06:13.340
IT'S GONNA COST ME THOUSANDS
AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.542
THIS COULD BE
A REAL GAMBLE FOR ME.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.910
- ALL RIGHT.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.144
[balloon pops]
OOH!

06:18.178 --> 06:19.245
ARE WE READY?

06:19.279 --> 06:20.780
GOT SOME KIDS COMIN'.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.419
- WOULD YOU, LIKE,
LIKE A REALLY CRAZY HAT?

06:29.456 --> 06:31.891
- YEAH, I'LL TRY ONE ON
BEFORE ANYONE GETS HERE. OKAY.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.059
- ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS GOOD?
ALL RIGHT.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.764
ALL RIGHT...
SO STAND BACK.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.432
- OH, WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.067
- THERE YOU GO.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.736
THAT'S PRETTY NIFTY.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.070
ALL RIGHT.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.613
- HEY, JUSTIN, IT'S ME.

06:53.646 --> 06:54.981
UH, I'M A COUPLE
OF MINUTES LATE,

06:55.081 --> 06:57.851
BUT I'LL BE
AT 61 IRVING SHORTLY.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.390
IRVING IS A SHORT STREET
SOUTH OF GRAMERCY PARK.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.025
PEOPLE JUST LOVE GRAMERCY.

07:05.058 --> 07:08.028
IT'S QUIET,
BEAUTIFUL TOWNHOUSES.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.030
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE AREA.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.398
AND VERY HISTORIC.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.034
- HEY, FREDRIK!
- HOW ARE YOU?

07:14.034 --> 07:16.036
YOU READY?
- YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.038
SO, MARCELLA,
THIS IS FREDRIK.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.039
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU. MWAH!

07:19.039 --> 07:20.273
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- MWAH!

07:20.306 --> 07:21.574
- JUSTIN PUT A LOT OF WORK

07:21.608 --> 07:23.610
INTO CULTIVATING
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MARCELLA.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.311
BUT IT'S A TWO-WAY STREET.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.047
HE USED MY NAME
AND MY TRACK RECORD

07:27.047 --> 07:28.048
TO WIN HER OVER.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.482
- COME ON IN.
SEE THE PLACE.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.051
- ISN'T THIS PLACE BEAUTIFUL?

07:40.527 --> 07:41.928
- THIS COULD BE WHAT WE CALL
THE HERO SHOT,

07:41.961 --> 07:44.064
WHICH IS THE SHOT THAT GOES
IN FRONT OF THE LISTING.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.066
AND THEN YOU, LIKE,
IN THE FRONT OF THE PHOTO,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.300
YOU SEE THE SPAGHETTI LAMP.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.601
- SPAGHETTI LAMP?

07:48.635 --> 07:50.070
SAY SOMETHING
MORE ELEGANT THAN THAT.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.671
WELL, IT'S--
- I LIKE SPAGHETTI.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.373
[laughter]

08:04.184 --> 08:05.452
- PSHH!

08:05.485 --> 08:06.486
[laughter]

08:06.519 --> 08:08.822
PSHH!

08:08.855 --> 08:11.024
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HAVING US

08:11.057 --> 08:12.292
COME AND LOOK
AT THE APARTMENT.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.494
WHY ARE YOU MOVING?
LET ME JUST ASK YOU.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.696
- I RUN A LUXURY CONSULTING
BUSINESS HERE IN THE CITY.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.165
BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
WITH THE BUSINESS

08:19.199 --> 08:21.634
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY
PUT ME IN MILAN.

08:21.668 --> 08:25.038
- WHAT IS THE PRICE
THAT YOU HAVE IN MIND?

08:25.071 --> 08:29.342
- UM...I'M THINKING 3.6.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.344
- I THINK THAT'S A...

08:33.079 --> 08:35.048
IT'S GOOD,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE HIGH.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.951
- AND I DID, I MEAN,
WE HAD SPOKE ON THIS,

08:38.051 --> 08:40.053
YOU KNOW,
IN THE--PREVIOUSLY.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.055
I THINK THAT'S A VERY
CONSERVATIVE PRICE.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.057
- CONSERVATIVE?

08:44.057 --> 08:45.058
- RIGHT.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.093
- LIKE YOU THINK
MORE THAN 3.6?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.728
- I MEAN, YOU--
I DO.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.364
- EVEN THOUGH MARCELLA'S PLACE
IS ON GRAMERCY,

08:51.398 --> 08:54.100
IT'S STILL A COOP,
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A DOORMAN.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.836
$3.6 MILLION,
1,800 A FOOT?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.538
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
ON THE HIGH SIDE.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.106
I DON'T WANT
TO SOUND NEGATIVE,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.542
BUT IT IS REALLY
A TWO-BEDROOM.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.378
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH
TO LIST IT OVER 3.5.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.313
JUSTIN SHOULD REALLY
HAVE CONSULTED WITH ME

09:07.347 --> 09:10.050
BEFORE HE GAVE MARCELLA
HIS INFLATED NUMBER.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.085
A GOOD BROKER
IN THIS MARKET...

09:12.118 --> 09:13.453
PRICE IT RIGHT.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.093
- OKAY, I--I FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH A...

09:20.126 --> 09:21.094
- GREAT.
- WITH THAT PRICE.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.730
- SO I BROUGHT
A LISTING AGREEMENT.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.665
- OKAY.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.667
- NOW YOU SIGN.
- OKAY.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.735
- AND WE'RE GONNA
MAKE YOU PROUD.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.770
- OKAY.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.038
- WOW.
- THERE WE ARE.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.740
- MY STOMACH JUST DROPPED.
OH, BOY.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.108
- I HOPE IT WAS
A GOOD FEELING.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.577
- YOU'RE PUTTING MY REPUTATION
OUT THERE.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.546
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T FAIL.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.314
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.762
- OH, COME ON IN.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.164
MY STRATEGY TO SELL IT
IS JUST TO GET PEOPLE IN THERE.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.432
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD

09:59.466 --> 10:01.434
TO MARKET THIS PROPERTY
TOWARDS FAMILIES.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.170
I ADVERTISED ON SOCIAL
NETWORKING WEBSITES,

10:04.204 --> 10:06.239
NUMEROUS FAMILY MAGAZINES
AND PERIODICALS.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.607
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT IT.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.209
THE WHOLE HOUSE IS PRETTY MUCH
CONTROLLED FROM HERE.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.177
YOU CAN WATCH
THE BACKYARD.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.412
GOT THE CARNIVAL SET UP.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.347
- HOW MANY SQUARE FOOT
IS THIS BROWNSTONE?

10:14.381 --> 10:15.849
- THE WHOLE HOUSE?
ABOUT 4,500 SQUARE FEET.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.350
AND THEN HERE'S
THIS LITTLE ROOM.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.185
IT'S--KIND OF SET UP
AS TWO AREAS,

10:19.219 --> 10:21.821
SO IT HAS THE SLEEPING AREA
AND THE PLAY AREA.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.223
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.824
- THE KING OF DOWNTOWN
REAL ESTATE.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.126
- VERY BUSY?

10:26.159 --> 10:28.061
- YEAH, THIS IS OUR
NEW LISTING HERE.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.329
IT'S A BRAND-NEW TOWNHOUSE.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.297
- I SAW A CLOWN.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BROKER.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.033
- [laughs]

10:33.066 --> 10:35.235
NO, BUT THERE'S ONE--THERE'S
A GAME THERE CALLED BIG MOUTH,

10:35.268 --> 10:36.903
WHICH IS WHAT BROKERS
ARE USUALLY CALLED.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.238
- VERY CUTE PROPS.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.873
I'M FEELING
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

10:39.906 --> 10:42.242
WITH ALL THIS CRAP HERE
GEARED TOWARDS CHILDREN,

10:42.275 --> 10:44.044
AND NOT ONE
HAS SHOWN UP YET.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.145
DO YOU HAVE KIDS OR...

10:45.178 --> 10:46.312
- UH-NO.
- NIECES OR NEPHEWS?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.181
HEY, YOU WANT COTTON CANDY
OR POPCORN?

10:52.052 --> 10:53.720
[doorbell rings]

10:53.753 --> 10:55.055
[child shouting]

10:55.088 --> 10:56.556
- HELLO?
[gasps] HELLO!

10:56.589 --> 10:58.391
both: HI.
- COME ON IN .

10:58.425 --> 11:00.260
WELCOME.
- THANK YOU.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.394
- HI. HOW'S IT GOING?

11:01.428 --> 11:02.929
- IT'S GOIN'.
COME ON IN.

11:02.962 --> 11:03.930
- COME ON IN!

11:03.963 --> 11:05.298
- I WANNA GO SEE...

11:05.331 --> 11:06.232
- LET'S GO OUTSIDE
AND PLAY GAMES.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.233
- OKAY.
- YES!

11:07.267 --> 11:08.301
- LET'S SEE THE GARDEN.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.738
- YES, UH,
THIS IS A BRAND-NEW GARDEN.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.812
YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT
FOR FAMILIES WITH PETS,

11:18.845 --> 11:20.980
AND A YARD WITHOUT HAVING
PEOPLE GO INTO A PARK.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.183
YOU CAN HAVE KIDS OUT HERE,
YOU KNOW,

11:23.216 --> 11:24.384
THEY COULD BE PLAYING AND...

11:24.417 --> 11:25.785
- THERE YOU GO!

11:30.457 --> 11:31.958
[laughter]
- IT IS.

11:31.991 --> 11:33.259
- HOW 'BOUT AT AN OPEN HOUSE?

11:33.293 --> 11:34.594
- OH, YEAH.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.796
- HERE WE ARE, THIS IS
THE TOP FLOOR OF THE HOUSE.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.298
THIS IS WHERE, LIKE,
THE KIDS LIVE.

11:38.331 --> 11:41.334
- OH, COOL.
- LOOK AT THIS, ALEX.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.104
- YOU GUYS ARE THE FIRST
CUSTOMERS I HAD

11:44.104 --> 11:45.472
TO PLAY IN THE KIDS' ROOM.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.474
I'M FINALLY LEARNING THE TYPE
OF BROKER I WANT TO BE.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.142
I'M FINALLY APPLYING
MY KNOWLEDGE

11:49.175 --> 11:50.744
AND MY SKILLS TO USE.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.278
YOU KNOW,
ANYONE CAN HAVE A HOUSE.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.215
BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE
CAN ACTUALLY SELL A HOME.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.282
- HOLD ON A SECOND.
LET ME SEE.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.283
YOU LOOK GOOD.
VERY NICE.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.318
- THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.253
- WELL, I PUT THE HAT ON...

12:00.286 --> 12:02.789
IT'S JUST HARD
TO REALLY WALK AROUND.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.290
- IT LOOKS GOOD, THOUGH!

12:04.324 --> 12:05.291
- OKAY.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.659
[laughter]

12:15.335 --> 12:16.302
[doorbell rings]

12:16.336 --> 12:17.837
[knock on door]

12:19.472 --> 12:21.141
- HELLO, RYAN.
- HELLO.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.308
- HEY, JESSICA.
HOW ARE YOU?

12:22.342 --> 12:23.643
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:23.677 --> 12:24.944
THIS IS MALCOLM.
- MALCOLM.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.312
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.314
- AND ROBERT.
- ROBERT.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.582
- JESSICA'S CLIENT MALCOLM

12:29.616 --> 12:31.951
IS AN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL
VENTURE CAPITALIST,

12:31.985 --> 12:33.319
SO I KNOW HE'S GOT THE MONEY.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.155
- I LOVE THESE DOORS.
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.123
SO THESE DOORS
WERE IMPORTED FROM PARIS.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.358
OKAY?
- WOW.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.360
- BUT AT THIS APARTMENT'S
PRICE POINT,

12:40.393 --> 12:43.163
YOU DON'T GET AS MANY CLIENTS
AS YOU WOULD, SAY,

12:43.196 --> 12:44.831
IF THE APARTMENT WERE
ONLY A FEW MILLION.

12:44.864 --> 12:47.133
SO THERE'S ADDED PRESSURE
WITH EVERY SHOWING.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.338
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS PENTHOUSE
"A" AND "B," WHICH WERE BOUGHT,

12:51.371 --> 12:53.373
AND THEN THE ROOF WAS BOUGHT
FROM THE BUILDING,

12:53.406 --> 12:54.374
AND THEN AIR RIGHTS.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.309
- WOW.

12:56.343 --> 13:00.213
SO THEN THIS IS WHAT I WOULD
CALL KIND OF THE MASTER KITCHEN.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.251
OR...YEAH.
- MOST LIKELY.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.553
- THIS IS NOT HIS TASTE
AT ALL.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.254
- OKAY.
- IT'S JUST TOO RUSTIC.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.356
- OKAY.
- THERE YOU GO.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.490
THAT'S THE WORD, EXACTLY.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.058
- TOO RUSTIC.
SURE.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.596
- AND THESE ARE
NICE VIEWS.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.631
- AND THEN YOU'RE LOOKING
AT ALL OF DOWNTOWN.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.367
SO YOU'VE GOT CITY HALL...

13:20.400 --> 13:22.068
- WELL, IF YOU'RE TALL.
- WORLD TRADE CENTER.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.371
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
[laughter]

13:24.404 --> 13:25.605
YOU SAID YOU LIKE
THE OUTDOOR SPACE?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.774
- YES, OUTDOOR SPACE
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.176
- DO YOU LIKE THIS?
DO YOU LIKE THIS OUTDOOR SPACE?

13:30.210 --> 13:31.811
- NO.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.314
IT'S...TOO SMALL.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.216
AND...

13:36.249 --> 13:37.250
NO.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.354
- WELL, THIS IS...
KIND OF RUDE.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.422
SO WE'RE LEAVING
THE BIG APARTMENT

13:42.455 --> 13:44.424
GOING INTO, YOU KNOW,
THE RESIDENTIAL PORTION.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.892
- OKAY.
- SO, YOU SEE,

13:45.925 --> 13:47.560
YOU CONNECT THEM, BASICALLY,

13:47.594 --> 13:48.762
AESTHETICALLY TO THE EYE,

13:48.795 --> 13:50.663
WITH ALL THE SAME
VENETIAN PLASTER.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.098
SO YOU HAVE
ANOTHER POWDER ROOM HERE.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.169
- THIS TILE IS...
- OUT.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.704
- WELL, THIS WAS ALL
IMPORTED FROM FLORENCE.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.873
- CAN YOU SEND IT BACK?
- SEND IT BACK TO FLORENCE.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.241
- [laughs]

14:01.274 --> 14:02.375
- AS A REAL ESTATE AGENT,

14:02.409 --> 14:04.044
YOU OCCASIONALLY
HAVE BAD SHOWINGS.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.612
IT JUST GOES
WITH THE TERRITORY.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.113
- VERY GOOD, THANK YOU.
- ABSOLUTELY.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.381
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.549
- AS THEY'RE WALKING OUT,

14:09.582 --> 14:11.151
I'LL BET MY LAST FIVE
COMMISSION CHECKS

14:11.184 --> 14:14.154
THAT I'LL NEVER HEAR FROM
JESSICA AND HER BUYER AGAIN.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.224
- I THINK SO.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.772
- MMM.
- HELLO.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.074
- HEY, FREDRIK.
GOOD MORNING.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.375
WOW, NICE LITTLE BREAKFAST.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.177
I GOT A COFFEE FOR YOU.
- I DON'T DRINK COFFEE.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.846
THIS LISTING AT IRVING IS A BIG
OPPORTUNITY FOR JUSTIN.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.449
IT'S TIME FOR HIM
TO EITHER SINK OR TO SWIM.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.850
- UM, SO LISTEN, I'VE BEEN
BACK AND FORTH

14:43.883 --> 14:45.185
WITH THESE CATERERS.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.786
I GOT SABRINA BASS

14:46.820 --> 14:48.822
WHO DID CATERING
FOR ANNA WINTOUR.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.457
- OKAY, WELL,
HOW MUCH IS IT?

14:50.490 --> 14:51.491
- UM, YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T CHEAP.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.493
I WAS--I THOUGHT
IT WAS A LITTLE HIGH.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.261
I THINK IT'S LIKE
$1,100 OR SOMETHING.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.497
- AND I'M PAYING FOR THIS?

14:57.530 --> 14:59.432
I THINK--
I GOT 20 RSVPs.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.434
- UM, RUTH IS BACK
AT THE OFFICE.

15:01.468 --> 15:04.404
- IT SAYS 30 GUESTS.
SO HOW DID WE GET 10 MORE THEN?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.373
- RUTH IS CALLING,
LIKE, EVERY TOP BROKER.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.674
- BUT WHY ARE YOU
CALLING RUTH?

15:07.707 --> 15:08.942
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING THAT
ON HER?

15:09.042 --> 15:10.510
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
ASSISTANT NOW?

15:10.543 --> 15:11.678
IT JUST MAKES ME
UNCOMFORTABLE

15:11.711 --> 15:13.079
THAT RUTH'S SITTING THERE
CALLING THESE PEOPLE.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.447
THIS SHOULD
REALLY BE OUR TASK.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.449
- WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM
ON THE FOREFRONT HERE.

15:16.483 --> 15:21.488
THERE IS NO A.C.
AT THE GRAMERCY.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.256
APPARENTLY,
THERE'S A BUILDING PROBLEM,

15:23.289 --> 15:25.492
AND IT'S GONNA BE IN THE 90s.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.094
- I'M SWEATING ALREADY NOW
WHEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.396
- I SPOKE WITH HER.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.897
SHE'S GONNA LEAVE THE WINDOWS
OPEN OVERNIGHT.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.232
- I'M SORRY, BUT THIS DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE A SUCCESSFUL

15:32.265 --> 15:33.667
BROKER'S OPEN HOUSE.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.102
WHATEVER WE DO,
IT HAS TO BE A SUCCESS.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.171
EVERY, SINGLE, SOLITARY THING.
YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY--

15:38.204 --> 15:40.573
I'M OBSESSIVE
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.142
- NO, BUT--
- AND I WANT YOU TO BE TOO.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.244
AND I WANT IT TO COME FROM YOU.
I WANT YOU TO COME IN HERE

15:44.277 --> 15:47.080
AND BE LIKE,
"FREDRIK, 60 BROKERS, DONE."

15:47.113 --> 15:49.115
- TRUST ME, WE'RE ALREADY
CREATING A BUZZ.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.184
I'VE GOTTEN SEVERAL PEOPLE--
- A BUZZ WITH 20 PEOPLE?

15:51.217 --> 15:53.353
- I GOT FIVE PHONE CALLS--
- THE BUZZ IS GONNA BE TO--

15:53.386 --> 15:55.355
AFTER THE OPEN HOUSE TOMORROW,
THAT EVERYBODY WAS SWEATING.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.525
THE MAKEUP WAS RUNNING.
THE SALMON WAS LIKE,

15:58.558 --> 16:01.027
STEAMY ON THE PLATE
BECAUSE IT WAS SO HOT,

16:01.061 --> 16:02.862
AND...WHAT ELSE
COULD GO WRONG?

16:02.896 --> 16:04.164
- I'M NOT CONCERNED,

16:04.197 --> 16:05.932
AND I'M NOT EVEN
A LITTLE BIT WORRIED.

16:06.032 --> 16:09.836
- THE BEST WAY TO LEARN
IS TO WATCH AND TO LISTEN.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.838
JUSTIN, HE JUST TALKS.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.573
HE DOESN'T REALLY LISTEN.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.175
- I'VE HAD SEVERAL BROKERS
THAT HAVE TOLD ME,

16:15.208 --> 16:17.444
YOU WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM
SELLING THIS APARTMENT.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.945
- YOU SEE,
THIS IS THE EXACT PROBLEM.

16:19.045 --> 16:22.182
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
IS THE EXACT PROBLEM.

16:22.215 --> 16:25.151
YOU THINK YOU KNOW IT ALL.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.287
PARTNERING UP
WITH A JUNIOR BROKER

16:27.320 --> 16:28.688
REQUIRES A LOT OF PATIENCE.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.557
BUT IT DOESN'T DO ME
ANY GOOD

16:30.590 --> 16:32.559
TO FIRE JUSTIN
OFF THIS LISTING.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.860
THE MORE I WORK
WITH MY ASSISTANTS,

16:33.893 --> 16:36.162
THE MORE MY BUSINESS
IS GONNA GROW.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.697
OKAY, CALL THE AC GUY NOW.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.532
I'M GONNA CALL
SOME MORE BROKERS.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.600
- OKAY.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.977
[beeping]

16:51.077 --> 16:51.978
- BETH, IT'S RYAN.

16:52.078 --> 16:53.179
HEY, JANICE, HOW ARE YOU?

16:53.213 --> 16:54.681
THIS IS RYAN SERHANT
FROM NEST SEEKERS.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.983
JUST FOLLOWING UP
ON THE PARTY THAT I HAD

16:57.083 --> 16:58.518
OVER AT 95 GREENE.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.553
SELLING THIS APARTMENT
IS NOW MY ONLY JOB.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.788
IT'S MY TOP PRIORITY.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.456
I'M LOCKING MYSELF
IN MY OFFICE,

17:03.490 --> 17:05.825
AND I'M CALLING EVERYONE
I'VE EVER MET.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.560
JUST WANTED TO CALL AND SEE
WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

17:07.594 --> 17:09.162
THE PARTY AT GREENE STREET.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.564
EVERYONE I'VE EVER
DONE BUSINESS WITH.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.699
- I HAVE SOME MORE FILES.
- OKAY.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.567
- TRY THAT.
- YOU KNOW, THE RICH KIDS

17:14.601 --> 17:15.568
I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.704
HEY, DANIELLE.
IT'S RYAN.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.873
JUST LETTING THEM KNOW,
"HEY, I'VE GOT THIS APARTMENT.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.075
GIVE ME A CALL BACK.
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT."

17:23.610 --> 17:25.512
YOU KNOW, I CAN SEND YOU
SOME OF THE MARKETING MATERIALS.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.080
I MEAN, WE'RE REALLY
GOING ALL OUT FOR THIS ONE.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.621
- WHAT'S SHAKIN'?

17:34.654 --> 17:37.457
- JUST...DOING FOLLOW-UPS.

17:37.490 --> 17:41.061
- THIS EVENT AND PARTY
WITH PRESS, WITH FASHION,

17:41.061 --> 17:42.062
WITH THIS, WITH THAT.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.463
NOW IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.399
I'M JUST GONNA
CONSERVATIVELY GUESS

17:46.433 --> 17:48.635
$70,000, $80,000...

17:48.668 --> 17:50.236
THAT WENT INTO THIS EVENT.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.871
WHAT DOES IT ADD UP TO?

17:51.905 --> 17:53.306
- A LOT OF FEEDBACK.
GOOD FEEDBACK.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.275
EVERYONE LOVES THE PARTY.
EVERYONE HAD A GREAT TIME.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.943
- FEEDBACK?

17:56.976 --> 17:58.411
- [ahem].

17:58.445 --> 17:59.612
- YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR REPUTATION
OUT THERE.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.047
YOU'RE PUTTING
OUR REPUTATION OUT THERE.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.615
YOU'RE PUTTING MY REPUTATION
OUT THERE.

18:02.649 --> 18:06.586
WHICH MEANS...
THAT YOU CAN'T FAIL.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.555
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.723
- I'M STILL CALLING.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.791
I'M GONNA BE HERE UNTIL
ALL THESE CALLS ARE MADE.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.493
- WE'LL SEE.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.132
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:19.165 --> 18:20.367
I DON'T WANT
THIS ENERGY HERE, RYAN.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.534
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.736
- YES, I'M LOOKING YOU
IN THE EYE.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.437
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.882
- I HAVE YOUR APPOINTMENTS
FOR TODAY, SO...

18:35.915 --> 18:37.217
- WAIT, WHAT TIME IS IT?

18:37.250 --> 18:38.284
- IS THAT A REAL ROLEX

18:38.318 --> 18:39.619
OR IS THAT THE FAKE ONE
THAT YOU WEAR?

18:39.652 --> 18:41.421
- [chuckles]
IT'S A REAL ONE.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.156
- BUT THE REAL ONES DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF A FACE ON IT.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.258
- SO THAT'S ABOUT $12,000
WORTH OF GOLD,

18:45.291 --> 18:48.061
AND THE OTHER 20,000 IS BECAUSE
IT'S THE STUPID NAME.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.230
IF YOU WANT IT...
- YEAH! THAT WAS SO COOL.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.900
IT'S STUCK.

18:55.669 --> 18:57.370
TINA, TINA...
CAN YOU GIVE IT TO ME, PLEASE?

18:57.404 --> 18:58.972
- NO, IT'S FINE.
IT JUST HAS TO STAY ON.

18:59.072 --> 19:02.375
- TINA...COULD YOU
TAKE THE WATCH OFF, PLEASE?

19:02.409 --> 19:04.611
[phone rings]

19:04.644 --> 19:06.012
THIS IS RYAN.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.251
HEY, KAPTAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

19:20.727 --> 19:21.895
I LOVE FRENCH PEOPLE.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.767
OKAY, SO YOU'D PREVIEW
FOR HIM.

19:27.801 --> 19:28.802
HERE, I'M GONNA HAVE
MY ASSISTANT CALL YOU BACK

19:28.835 --> 19:30.036
AND GET ALL THE INFORMATION.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.373
THANKS, MAN.
THANKS FOR THE CALL.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.041
YES.

19:35.075 --> 19:37.143
FINALLY, A LEAD.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.212
SET THAT UP FOR TWO, PLEASE.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.715
AND IF YOU COULD ALSO
GIVE ME MY WATCH BACK.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.717
TINA. TINA.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.851
TINA?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.761
- ARE THOSE THE A.C. UNITS?

19:54.794 --> 19:57.263
THEY'RE HUGE.
HOLY MOLY.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.768
HI. THANKS FOR COMING.
IT'S A HOT DAY.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.771
HAVE YOU SEEN, UH,
MY ASSISTANT, JUSTIN?

20:13.813 --> 20:15.515
I DON'T HAVE ANY--
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, EITHER.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.017
MY OPEN HOUSE IS STARTING.
LET'S DO THIS, COME ON.

20:17.050 --> 20:17.951
- LET'S DO THIS, MAN.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.819
- ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH. LET'S GO.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.623
- IT'S SO HOT.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.592
- AND...
- WHERE?

20:26.860 --> 20:29.729
FINALLY, ALL THESE YEARS
IN THE GYM.

20:29.763 --> 20:32.332
DO YOU GO TO THE GYM, SIR?

20:32.365 --> 20:34.100
ONCE? ONCE?
YOU WENT TO THE GYM ONCE?

20:34.134 --> 20:37.137
- YEAH, I--
- I WENT ONCE, TODAY.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.272
[knock on door]

20:39.305 --> 20:40.807
[dog barking]
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.442
IT'S OKAY.
COME HERE.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.510
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

20:43.543 --> 20:44.944
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU
DOWNSTAIRS.

20:44.978 --> 20:45.945
WHAT?

20:45.979 --> 20:47.681
HE WAS HERE
THE ENTIRE TIME?

20:47.714 --> 20:49.516
- ARE THEY HEAVY?
- THEY'RE SUPER HEAVY.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.151
WHY DO YOU THINK
I LOOK LIKE THIS?

20:51.184 --> 20:52.852
- OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS AMAZING.

20:52.886 --> 20:55.522
WHEW! WHEW!

20:55.555 --> 20:57.657
JUSTIN...AH.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.359
THIS DOESN'T LOOK
REALLY GREAT.

21:01.061 --> 21:02.829
OH! YOU PUT
YOUR PHOTO THERE--

21:02.862 --> 21:04.864
- YOUR PHOTO
WOULDN'T COME ON THERE.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.635
- WHERE'S THE CATERER?
CAN YOU CALL HIM?

21:08.668 --> 21:10.503
WHAT--WHOSE IS THIS?
- MINE.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.838
- GET--REMOVE IT.
WE HAVE TO--

21:11.871 --> 21:13.073
THIS HAS TO BE PERFECT.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.674
THE DAY JUSTIN LEAVES ME

21:14.708 --> 21:16.109
AND GOES ON HIS OWN,

21:16.142 --> 21:17.477
I CONGRATULATE HIM.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.846
BUT UNTIL THEN,
IT HAS TO BE DONE MY WAY.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.881
WHICH IS THE RIGHT WAY.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.152
[air conditioner blowing]

21:26.186 --> 21:27.587
[doorbell rings]
- HEY, THERE, HOW ARE YOU?

21:27.620 --> 21:28.855
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M JUSTIN.

21:28.888 --> 21:29.422
- I'M KENNY.
HOW ARE YOU?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.324
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.326
THIS WAS--THIS WAS A GYMNASIUM.
THIS WAS A SCHOOL.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.428
BACK IN THE 1900s,
THIS WAS A SCHOOL.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.429
- CAN I GO UPSTAIRS
AND HAVE A LOOK?

21:36.463 --> 21:37.564
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.299
[doorbell rings]
- I'LL TAKE HIM.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.835
THIS BEAUTIFUL FLOATING
STAIRCASE, THIS WAS CUSTOM.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.269
[overlapping chatter]

21:43.303 --> 21:44.704
- YEAH.
- HELLO, HELLO.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.309
- YEAH, I THINK YOU DO.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.910
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS VERY GOOD.

21:50.944 --> 21:52.812
THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME.
- NO PROBLEM, THANKS FOR COMING.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.116
- JUSTIN...

21:56.116 --> 21:58.284
- NO PRICE. NO...

21:58.318 --> 21:59.753
- THERE'S NO PRICE
ON THIS...

21:59.786 --> 22:01.254
- 3.5.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.455
- AND THIS APARTMENT SHOULD--

22:02.489 --> 22:04.190
SHOULDN'T REALLY BE MEASURED
IN SQUARE FEET.

22:04.224 --> 22:05.492
IT SHOULD BE MEASURED
IN CUBIC FT.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.293
WHEN SHE BOUGHT THIS,
IT WAS A GUT.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.595
- OKAY.
- BEHIND THE WALLS,

22:08.628 --> 22:10.764
SHE FOUND A BEAUTIFUL BRICK.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.098
LITTLE BREAKFAST BAR.

22:12.132 --> 22:14.401
- THEY REALLY MAINTAIN
THE WHITE AND STAINLESS.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.336
I LIKE THAT A LOT.
- I'M GOING TO SEE RIGHT NOW.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.304
- HI.
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.472
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
CALL YOU BACK.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.242
SORRY, MY...
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:22.275 --> 22:23.810
- UH, COMING FOR FREE FOOD.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.680
NO, NO, I JUST WANTED
TO LOOK AT THE OLD HOUSE.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.314
OH, I'LL SIGN IN.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.783
- I HAVEN'T SEEN RYAN
IN A WHILE,

22:29.816 --> 22:32.352
BUT EVERY TIME I DO,
IT'S TROUBLE.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.486
WHO SAID IT WAS CHINATOWN?

22:33.520 --> 22:35.955
- THIS--THIS GOES
TO CANAL STREET, RIGHT?

22:35.989 --> 22:37.390
- DO YOU KNOW DOWNTOWN?

22:37.424 --> 22:38.992
- HERE, I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD.
GIVE YOU MY CARD.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.727
DON'T TELL ANY OF THE BROKERS
HERE I GAVE YOU MY CARD, THOUGH,

22:40.760 --> 22:42.395
BECAUSE
IT'S KIND OF THEIR PARTY.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.730
- UM...

22:44.998 --> 22:46.399
NO, HE'S LEAVING SOON.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.967
IT'S OKAY, HE DOESN'T
NEED ANYTHING TO DRINK.

22:48.001 --> 22:49.002
- I'LL TAKE A WATER, ACTUALLY.

22:49.102 --> 22:51.471
IT'S LIKE
100 DEGREES OUTSIDE.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.907
- WILL--JUSTIN, WILL YOU
TAKE THEM ON A LITTLE TOUR?

22:53.940 --> 22:56.109
SORRY, GUYS, I JUST HAVE
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.677
- YOU WANNA GIVE ME--
- NO, I'M NOT GIVING YOU A TOUR,

22:57.711 --> 22:58.678
'CAUSE I WANNA TALK ABOUT THIS.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.480
YOU COME TO MY PARTY,
949 PARK.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.916
YOU GIVE OUT YOUR BUSINESS CARD
TO MY CLIENTS, I MEAN--

23:02.949 --> 23:05.085
- JUST LIKE YOU CAME,
SAT DOWN AT LUNCH AT CAFETERIA

23:05.118 --> 23:06.720
AND GAVE OUT YOUR BUSINESS CARD
TO MY CLIENTS?

23:06.753 --> 23:08.054
- IT'S NOT
A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.823
- THE APARTMENT IS NOT
A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT!

23:09.856 --> 23:13.193
- I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD
IN THE EVENT YOU WANNA...

23:13.226 --> 23:14.527
ACTUALLY SELL THE APARTMENT.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.230
- I, HONESTLY,
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW,

23:17.263 --> 23:18.398
BUT WE'RE ON GRAMERCY, RIGHT?

23:18.431 --> 23:20.467
THIS IS KIND OF
ONE OF MY AREAS.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.068
- I DON'T WANT
THIS ENERGY HERE, RYAN.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.803
IT'S--I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.
- I'M HERE TO SEE THE APARTMENT.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.405
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

23:25.438 --> 23:26.706
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS,
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU PRETEND

23:26.740 --> 23:27.907
LIKE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING,

23:27.941 --> 23:29.409
AND YOU WANNA BE, LIKE,
THE GUY IN THE ROOM.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.643
I HAVE SOMEONE
FOR THIS APARTMENT.

23:30.677 --> 23:31.644
IF YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
THE APARTMENT,

23:31.678 --> 23:32.579
I'LL TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.880
I'M NOT GONNA RAISE MY VOICE,

23:33.913 --> 23:35.081
'CAUSE I KNOW
THERE ARE PEOPLE UP THERE

23:35.081 --> 23:35.982
AND I DON'T WANT
TO EMBARRASS YOU.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.317
- I DON'T DO UNETHICAL THINGS.

23:37.350 --> 23:38.518
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN.
LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

23:38.551 --> 23:39.519
- I'M LOOKING YOU IN THE EYE.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.520
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE
RIGHT NOW.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.222
- YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?
- YES.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.391
- I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THE--
THIS IS [bleep] RIDICULOUS.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.960
HEY...HEY, YEAH.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.862
YEAH, I'M AT THE OPEN HOUSE
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.563
NO, I MEAN, IT'S AWESOME,

23:50.597 --> 23:52.399
BUT THE BROKER
IS ASKING ME TO LEAVE.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.734
- THIS IS THE FAKEST PHONE CALL
I'VE EVER SEEN.

23:54.768 --> 23:58.104
EVERYTHING THIS GUY DOES
IS DRAMA AND THEATRICS.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.139
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

23:59.172 --> 24:01.274
BYE.
SO THAT WAS YOUR BUYER.

24:01.307 --> 24:02.542
- I DON'T--RYAN,
I DON'T KNOW--

24:02.575 --> 24:03.743
- SO WE'LL BOTH LEAVE.
WE'LL BOTH LEAVE.

24:03.777 --> 24:04.944
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I EVER DID TO YOU.

24:05.045 --> 24:05.945
- ON, IT'S OKAY.
WE'LL BOTH LEAVE.

24:06.046 --> 24:07.247
- THANK YOU. LEAVE.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.649
- YOU DON'T INSULT
ANOTHER BROKER

24:09.683 --> 24:11.051
AT AN OPEN HOUSE.

24:11.051 --> 24:12.152
IT REALLY JUST
PISSES ME OFF.

24:12.185 --> 24:13.219
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU DO.

24:13.253 --> 24:15.455
YOUR REPUTATION
PRECEDES YOU.

24:19.092 --> 24:20.293
- [sighs]

24:20.326 --> 24:22.462
RYAN IS SO COMPLETELY
UNPROFESSIONAL.

24:22.495 --> 24:24.731
IT'S--IT'S DISAPPOINTING,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

24:24.764 --> 24:25.732
I'M SORRY.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.434
- ANYHOW, WE WERE
LOOKING AROUND.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.468
SO PLEASE CONTINUE.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.370
- RIGHT. 3 1/2 MILLION.
- YES, SIR.

24:30.403 --> 24:31.805
- 2,000 SQUARE FEET.

24:44.818 --> 24:46.419
- HI, MICHAEL?

24:49.456 --> 24:50.590
HI, MICHAEL?

24:50.623 --> 24:53.126
- OH. HEY.
- MICHAEL.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.494
- WE'VE ALL HEARD
ABOUT CHARLTON

24:54.527 --> 24:56.463
THROUGH A BROKER THAT WAS
AT MY OPEN HOUSE.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.098
EXCUSE ME, I'M JUST
DOING SOME YARD WORK.

24:58.131 --> 24:59.632
- SURE. YUVAL. HOW ARE YOU?
- MICHAEL LORBER.

24:59.666 --> 25:00.834
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.869
YUVAL'S CLIENTS
ARE A YOUNG FAMILY

25:02.902 --> 25:05.338
THAT WANT A SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE
AND DON'T WANNA DO ANY WORK.

25:05.372 --> 25:06.873
THEY WANT A TURNKEY HOME.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.208
BUT IT'S AN AMAZING YARD.

25:08.241 --> 25:09.376
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE IN THE CITY.

25:09.409 --> 25:10.577
I MEAN, YOU HEAR
THE BIRDS CHIRPING.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.545
IT'S SO QUIET, IT'S REALLY
LIKE A COUNTRY HOUSE

25:12.579 --> 25:13.480
IN THE CITY.

25:13.513 --> 25:14.781
YOU CAN SIT OUT HERE.

25:14.814 --> 25:15.815
YOU CAN MAKE THIS AREA
INTO A LIVING ROOM.

25:15.849 --> 25:19.052
[loud buzzing]
- [indistinct]

25:19.052 --> 25:21.654
[buzzing continues]

25:21.688 --> 25:23.156
- YEAH, SO LET'S GO.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.257
I'LL SHOW YOU THE REST
OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SPACE.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.425
BUT WE CAN GO
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

25:25.458 --> 25:26.593
- BEAUTIFUL SPACE DOWN HERE.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.761
- SO IN THIS FLOOR,
WE HAVE THE KITCHEN

25:27.794 --> 25:29.062
AND THE DINING ROOM.

25:29.062 --> 25:30.697
YOU KNOW, THEN THE ELEVATOR
ALSO STARTS HERE.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.065
- THAT'S GREAT.
OKAY, NICE.

25:32.065 --> 25:34.067
IS THE ELEVATOR HERE?
- YEAH, ELEVATOR'S HERE.

25:34.067 --> 25:35.301
- THAT LOOKS NICE.
CAN WE TAKE IT UP?

25:35.335 --> 25:37.170
- I MEAN, I DON'T LOVE
THE LITTLE SPACES.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.538
BUT I'LL, UH, YEAH,
I'LL TAKE IT UP--

25:38.571 --> 25:39.773
I'LL TAKE IT UP ONE FLIGHT.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.608
OKAY, LET'S GO
TO THE FIRST FLOOR.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.543
- OKAY, GREAT.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.945
[machinery moving]

25:45.979 --> 25:48.314
- I HATE BEING IN THESE
ELEVATORS ALONE,

25:48.348 --> 25:49.549
OR ESPECIALLY WITH
ANOTHER PERSON.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.418
YEAH, WE'RE MAKING IT UP.

25:54.087 --> 25:54.988
THEY'RE TEENY.

25:55.088 --> 25:56.189
THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE COFFINS

25:56.222 --> 25:57.557
GOING UP AND DOWN
THESE BUILDINGS.

25:58.792 --> 25:59.926
[clunk]

26:00.026 --> 26:02.362
OKAY. AH, GOOD.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.597
YES, UH, WE SHOULD BE
RIGHT IN THE FOYER RIGHT NOW.

26:04.631 --> 26:06.533
- YEAH, THIS IS GREAT.
- AND, UH...

26:06.566 --> 26:08.134
- YES, AND BOOM,
HERE WE ARE.

26:08.168 --> 26:10.303
- EXACTLY, I MEAN, WE COULD HAVE
TAKEN UP TWO MORE FLOORS.

26:10.337 --> 26:12.172
- YEAH, NO,
BUT THIS IS FABULOUS.

26:12.205 --> 26:13.540
- BUT, UH, YEAH.
WE MADE IT.

26:13.573 --> 26:14.874
REALLY, IT'S AN OLD HOUSE
FROM THE 1800s,

26:14.908 --> 26:17.043
BUT IT WAS
REBUILT COMPLETELY.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.144
THE ONLY THING THAT REMAINS

26:18.178 --> 26:19.946
IS THE FACADE
FACING THE THE STREET.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.514
- OH, YEAH, IT'S A GORGEOUS
STREET, YEAH, YEAH.

26:21.548 --> 26:23.283
I LOVE THE WINDOWS.
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS.

26:23.316 --> 26:25.051
- YEAH, THESE HUGE WINDOWS.
YOU SEE THESE, THEY'RE HERE.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.286
THEY'RE IN THE MASTER.

26:26.319 --> 26:27.454
- A GORGEOUS
LITTLE POWDER ROOM.

26:27.487 --> 26:29.356
- POWDER, SO THERE'S TWO
POWDER ROOMS IN THE HOUSE.

26:29.389 --> 26:30.824
- TWO POWDER ROOMS, OKAY.
GREAT.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.592
- I THINK, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A GREAT HOUSE

26:32.625 --> 26:33.860
IF YOU GOT CLIENTS.
- YEAH, DEFINITELY.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.528
I THINK I'M REALLY
GONNA HAVE SOMEONE.

26:35.562 --> 26:37.597
- YUVAL KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF WHAT I WAS LIKE

26:37.630 --> 26:39.065
IN LAW SCHOOL OR COLLEGE.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.333
HE'S A LITTLE ECCENTRIC.

26:40.367 --> 26:41.901
SO BE IN TOUCH,
AND I'LL LOOK FORWARD

26:41.935 --> 26:42.936
TO HEARING
FROM YOUR CLIENTS.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.639
[sighs]

26:58.084 --> 26:59.552
- I SAW THAT FREDRIK
WAS HAVING AN OPEN HOUSE.

26:59.586 --> 27:01.021
SO I WENT TO PREVIEW IT,

27:01.054 --> 27:02.655
AND OF COURSE FREDDY
HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT.

27:02.689 --> 27:03.923
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

27:04.024 --> 27:06.026
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER.
I'VE MOVED ON.

27:06.026 --> 27:07.427
[doorbell rings]

27:07.460 --> 27:09.396
IT'S A PAIN IN THE ASS,
AND TIME IS MONEY.

27:09.429 --> 27:11.431
SO I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK,
AND THAT'S WHAT...

27:11.464 --> 27:12.699
GETS MY BLOOD GOING.

27:12.732 --> 27:15.101
- HI, KAPTAN,
PLATINUM PROPERTIES.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.436
HOW YOU DOING?
- HEY, GOOD TO MEET YOU.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.338
KAPTAN HAS A CLIENT.

27:18.371 --> 27:19.873
AND THIS BUYER
IS A BILLIONAIRE.

27:19.906 --> 27:22.242
LIVES IN PARIS.
HE OWNS A TECH FIRM.

27:22.275 --> 27:23.677
THIS IS WHERE WE'LL START.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.545
SO LOOKS LIKE THE PICTURES,

27:25.578 --> 27:28.248
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY
BETTER IN REAL LIFE, RIGHT?

27:32.419 --> 27:34.621
WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE?

27:34.654 --> 27:36.723
LIKE, WHEN I FIRST
WALKED THROUGH THOSE DOORS,

27:36.756 --> 27:38.658
I COULD BARELY GET
MY JAW OFF THE GROUND.

27:38.692 --> 27:40.794
AND THEN THIS
IS THE MAIN CHEF'S KITCHEN.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.729
NOW, HE CONSULTED
WITH PHILIPPE STARCK.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.398
THE GOAL WAS TO HAVE A KITCHEN
THAT WAS BOTH RUSTIC

27:45.432 --> 27:46.666
BUT ALSO VERY BEAUTIFUL.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.468
- SURE.

27:50.637 --> 27:51.604
- OKAY.

27:52.605 --> 27:53.973
AND THEN YOU COME UP HERE,

27:54.074 --> 27:56.309
AND THEN THE SPACE JUST
TOTALLY OPENS UP.

27:56.343 --> 27:57.610
YOU KNOW, HE HAD A VISION,

27:57.644 --> 27:59.079
AND THAT'S
WHAT THIS APARTMENT IS.

27:59.079 --> 28:01.281
SO I THINK IT
SPEAKS TO PEOPLE THAT...

28:01.314 --> 28:02.282
THAT ARE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

28:02.315 --> 28:03.650
- RIGHT. OKAY.

28:05.485 --> 28:07.420
- AS A FORMER
SOAP OPERA ACTOR,

28:07.454 --> 28:09.656
THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO GET
A RESPONSE OUT OF SOMEONE,

28:09.689 --> 28:12.225
THERE IS NO GREATER TOOL
TO THE ACTOR

28:12.258 --> 28:13.660
THAN THE MONOLOGUE.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.662
ALL OF THESE WINDOWS
IN THE MAJORITY OF THE APARTMENT

28:15.695 --> 28:17.664
FACE DIRECTLY EAST
OUT OVER GREENE STREET.

28:17.697 --> 28:18.932
SO THE SUN WILL RISE HERE,

28:19.032 --> 28:20.633
AND THEN IT SETS OVER THERE.

28:20.667 --> 28:22.102
SO THAT'S WHY
THE WINDOWS THERE

28:22.135 --> 28:23.303
ARE BIGGER WITH
THE WATER TOWER,

28:23.336 --> 28:24.771
BECAUSE THEN YOU
GET THE SUNSETS.

28:24.804 --> 28:25.905
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONE
OF THE GREAT THINGS.

28:25.939 --> 28:27.340
WHEN WE WERE DOWNSTAIRS
COMING UP,

28:27.374 --> 28:28.675
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T--
YOU DON'T LOOK UP AND SAY,

28:28.708 --> 28:30.110
"OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET TO THAT."

28:30.143 --> 28:31.344
SO YOU COME OFF
THE ELEVATOR.

28:31.378 --> 28:33.680
YOU THROW OPEN THE NINE-FOOT
PARISIAN DOORS.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.516
AND YOU ENTER THIS BALLROOM
WHERE YOU'RE LIKE,

28:36.549 --> 28:38.151
HOW DID THIS EVER HAPPEN?

28:38.184 --> 28:40.754
AND THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT'S
EXCITING, I THINK,

28:40.787 --> 28:42.722
ABOUT THE APARTMENT.

28:42.756 --> 28:44.958
AND...SCENE.

28:45.058 --> 28:46.059
- I'LL SPEAK TO THE CLIENT,

28:46.092 --> 28:47.660
AND I WILL DEFINITELY
BE IN TOUCH.

28:47.694 --> 28:48.661
OKAY? THANK YOU.
- SOUNDS GOOD.

28:48.695 --> 28:49.696
- THANKS.
- CHEERS.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.899
- I MEAN, THE MOMENTUM IS THERE.
WE'RE EXCITED.

28:52.932 --> 28:57.671
- I HAVE SOME KIND OF BAD NEWS.

29:02.208 --> 29:05.145
- GORDY, DID YOU KNOW THIS PARK
WAS FOUNDED IN 1857

29:05.178 --> 29:07.313
AND HAS 843 ACRES?

29:07.347 --> 29:09.749
SO I BORROWED MY FRIEND'S DOG
TO HELP ME OUT.

29:09.783 --> 29:12.419
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MOVE,
MY NAME AND NUMBER'S ON HERE.

29:12.452 --> 29:13.687
AND TRY TO GENERATE
SOME BUSINESS,

29:13.720 --> 29:15.188
DO SOME GRASSROOTS
MARKETING.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.589
IN THE GRASS.

29:16.623 --> 29:18.792
DO YOU WANT A FRISBEE?

29:18.825 --> 29:20.827
YOU LOOKING FOR A NEW HOUSE?

29:20.860 --> 29:22.662
NOT A DOLLHOUSE,
A REAL HOUSE.

29:22.696 --> 29:25.031
MY PLAN IS
TO THROW OUT FRISBEES.

29:25.065 --> 29:26.866
IT'S LIKE THROWING SOMEBODY
A BUSINESS CARD

29:26.900 --> 29:28.902
THAT THEY'LL KEEP USING
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.370
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA.

29:30.403 --> 29:31.504
I HOPE.

29:31.538 --> 29:32.505
- OOH. OKAY.
- YEAH.

29:32.539 --> 29:34.307
[dog growls]
- OKAY.

29:34.341 --> 29:35.809
I HAVE A LITTLE SAYING
ON THERE.

29:35.842 --> 29:38.044
"FROM THE BOWERY
TO BARK AVENUE."

29:38.044 --> 29:39.813
HMM?

29:39.846 --> 29:41.181
BRING THAT ONE BACK TO ME!

29:41.214 --> 29:43.149
BRING IT TO A CLIENT!

29:43.183 --> 29:44.918
DO SOMETHING!

29:44.951 --> 29:46.920
[sighs and chuckles]
OHH.

29:46.953 --> 29:50.757
CO-BROKE WITH ME
A LITTLE.

29:56.830 --> 29:58.798
[doorbell rings]
[dog barking]

29:58.832 --> 30:00.800
- LOLA...
HI.

30:00.834 --> 30:03.203
MARCELLA HAS CALLED
JUSTIN AND I TO TALK.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.804
WE HAVEN'T HAD
ANY OFFERS YET,

30:04.838 --> 30:06.940
BUT I'M EXCITED
TO GIVE HER THE RESPONSE

30:06.973 --> 30:08.108
FROM THE OPEN HOUSE.

30:08.141 --> 30:09.809
I BROUGHT THIS FOR LOLA.
BECAUSE--

30:09.843 --> 30:11.144
- IT'S SO SWEET.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.879
- ISN'T IT CUTE? SO SHE--
YOU CAN TRAVEL WITH HER.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.814
BECAUSE I KNOW, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO ITALY.

30:14.848 --> 30:16.883
- THAT WAS VERY SWEET.
THANK YOU.

30:16.916 --> 30:17.951
THAT WAS VERY SWEET.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.820
- SO THE OPEN HOUSE
WAS A SUCCESS.

30:20.854 --> 30:22.722
I MEAN, THE MOMENTUM IS THERE,
AND WE CAN FEEL IT.

30:22.756 --> 30:24.290
WE'RE EXCITED AND...
- GUYS, GUYS.

30:24.324 --> 30:26.326
- WE FEEL LIKE AT ANY MINUTE--
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

30:26.359 --> 30:27.961
AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT
THIS HOUSE TOO.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.530
BUT I HAVE--I HAVE SOME
KIND OF BAD NEWS.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.265
UM...
- WHAT?

30:32.298 --> 30:34.000
- THE--THE DEAL WITH ITALY,
AS YOU KNOW,

30:34.034 --> 30:35.368
THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON,

30:35.402 --> 30:37.771
LOOKS LIKE IT'S REALLY NOT
GOING IN A GOOD WAY.

30:37.804 --> 30:39.806
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
THEN YOU CAN--

30:39.839 --> 30:41.775
WE SELL THE APARTMENT FOR YOU
AND YOU HAVE LOTS OF MONEY,

30:41.808 --> 30:42.876
IF THE DEAL ISN'T HAPPENING.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.310
- WELL, I'M IN THIS DILEMMA.

30:44.344 --> 30:46.846
IF I'M NOT LEAVING,
WHERE AM I GONNA GO?

30:46.880 --> 30:49.716
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU DON'T WANNA SELL ANYMORE?

30:49.749 --> 30:52.218
- THAT'S WHAT I'M--
I'M KIND OF THINKING MAYBE

30:52.252 --> 30:53.820
WE SHOULD TAKE IT
OFF THE MARKET.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.722
NOW, I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE PUT
SO MUCH WORK INTO THIS.

30:55.755 --> 30:58.158
BUT THERE'S A CHANCE, YOU KNOW,
THAT THINGS COULD

30:58.191 --> 31:00.160
CHANGE AROUND,
AND IN ANOTHER YEAR,

31:00.193 --> 31:02.095
YOU KNOW, I MAY--
MAY NOT BE HERE ANY--

31:02.128 --> 31:03.930
- THAT'S NOT EASY FOR SOMEONE--
FOR, LIKE, US TO TAKE.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.899
I MEAN, I SPENT A YEAR
GETTING TO KNOW YOU

31:05.932 --> 31:07.334
TO GET THIS.

31:07.367 --> 31:09.169
AND WE PUT ALL THIS EFFORT
INTO THAT OPEN HOUSE.

31:09.202 --> 31:11.671
- I'M REALLY VERY SORRY.

31:11.705 --> 31:12.839
- IT'S HARD WHEN
YOU HAVE MOMENTUM,

31:12.872 --> 31:14.374
AND THEN YOU KILL
THAT MOMENTUM.

31:14.407 --> 31:16.609
PEOPLE MAY LOOK BACK
IN A YEAR LATER AND SAY,

31:16.643 --> 31:17.877
"WELL, WHY DIDN'T IT
SELL THEN?"

31:17.911 --> 31:20.547
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO
KEEP THAT AT HEART.

31:20.580 --> 31:21.848
- IF I'M HERE IN NEW YORK,

31:21.881 --> 31:23.883
WHICH IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M GOING TO BE,

31:23.917 --> 31:25.485
THIS IS WHERE I WANNA LIVE.

31:25.518 --> 31:26.886
- WHAT CAN WE DO
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND?

31:26.920 --> 31:28.355
'CAUSE, LIKE, I COULD--

31:28.388 --> 31:29.789
- WAIT, WAIT, NO, NO.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WAIT, WAIT.

31:29.823 --> 31:32.092
I-I--I'M SORRY.

31:33.426 --> 31:35.228
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
LOUD AND CLEAR.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.530
I MEAN, WE'RE HERE FOR YOU
NOW OR IN TWO YEARS.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.232
- MM-HMM.
- YOU KNOW, AS A BROKER,

31:39.265 --> 31:43.103
YOU CAN NEVER PUSH A SELLER
INTO A DECISION, RIGHT?

31:43.136 --> 31:44.738
YOU KNOW, WE'RE STILL
YOUR FRIENDS,

31:44.771 --> 31:47.207
AND I HOPE THAT YOU DO
COME BACK TO US

31:47.240 --> 31:48.808
WHEN YOU ARE READY
TO MOVE TO ITALY.

31:48.842 --> 31:50.243
- I'M MORE DISAPPOINTED
THAN ANYONE.

31:50.276 --> 31:52.445
- IT'S OKAY, MARCELLA.
IT REALLY IS OKAY.

31:52.479 --> 31:55.815
AND PLEASE DO GET BACK TO US.
- ABSOLUTELY.

31:55.849 --> 31:56.983
- CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE
READY AGAIN.

31:57.017 --> 31:58.251
- ABSOLUTELY,
AND I HAVE SOME FRIENDS

31:58.284 --> 32:00.553
WHO HAVE SOME
FABULOUS APARTMENTS, SO...

32:00.587 --> 32:01.755
THEY WILL KNOW ABOUT YOU.

32:01.788 --> 32:02.756
- OKAY, THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

32:02.789 --> 32:04.057
- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

32:04.057 --> 32:06.292
I EMPATHIZE
WITH JUSTIN'S FRUSTRATION.

32:06.326 --> 32:08.361
IT'S NEVER FUN
TO WORK FOR A LONG TIME

32:08.395 --> 32:10.063
AND NOT GETTING PAID
A COMMISSION.

32:10.063 --> 32:12.065
BUT YOU CAN NEVER,
EVER, EVER...

32:12.065 --> 32:14.968
HAVE THE SELLER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
OUT FOR THE COMMISSION ONLY.

32:15.068 --> 32:16.803
- GOT CLOSE,
BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO?

32:16.836 --> 32:19.305
- WHEW.

32:19.339 --> 32:20.206
[dog barking]

32:20.240 --> 32:21.875
- OKAY.

32:21.908 --> 32:22.976
- I TRIED.

32:29.349 --> 32:30.450
- COME ON IN.

32:30.483 --> 32:31.985
YOU WANT SOME WATER
OR SOMETHING?

32:32.085 --> 32:33.586
- UH, SURE, WATER'S FINE.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.955
- YUVAL CALLED ME TO COME
SIT DOWN WITH ME IN MY OFFICE.

32:35.989 --> 32:37.657
IT COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

32:37.691 --> 32:38.792
WE'RE GETTING AN OFFER.

32:38.825 --> 32:40.927
THIS DEAL COULD BE
HUGE FOR ME.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.862
SO YOUR CLIENTS, THEY
WENT THROUGH THE HOUSE AGAIN?

32:42.896 --> 32:44.297
THEY LIKED IT?
- YEAH, THEY LIKED IT, YEAH.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.465
IT'S GOOD SPACE.

32:45.498 --> 32:46.800
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYS

32:46.833 --> 32:49.202
OBVIOUSLY WANT TO SUBMIT
AN OFFER, I THINK, YOU KNOW,

32:49.235 --> 32:50.837
WE'RE HAPPY
TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING.

32:50.870 --> 32:53.340
- YEAH, YOU THINK
THEY'D DO 7 1/2?

32:54.374 --> 32:55.675
- $7 1/2 MILLION
FOR THE HOUSE?

32:55.709 --> 32:58.111
- YEAH.
- YEAH, THAT'S...

32:58.144 --> 33:00.046
DEFINITELY TOO LOW.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.314
$7.5 MILLION?

33:01.348 --> 33:02.315
THAT'S A JOKE.

33:02.349 --> 33:04.317
THAT'S LESS THAN
$1,500 A FOOT.

33:04.351 --> 33:06.219
NOTHING SELLS
FOR THAT LOW AROUND HERE.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.054
YOU KNOW, MY CLIENT,
THIS IS HIS JO--

33:08.054 --> 33:09.189
THIS IS HIS BUSINESS

33:09.222 --> 33:11.791
IS TO BUILD THESE HOMES,
SELL THEM, DO IT AGAIN.

33:11.825 --> 33:13.093
YOU CAN'T DO IT AGAIN
IF YOU DON'T GET YOUR,

33:13.126 --> 33:14.661
YOU KNOW, EQUITY OUT.

33:14.694 --> 33:16.062

MICHAEL.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.264
- THERE'S NO WAY
I'M LETTING THIS PLACE

33:18.298 --> 33:19.499
GO FOR $7 1/2 MILLION.

33:19.532 --> 33:21.801
I BUSTED MY ASS
FOR THIS PROPERTY.

33:21.835 --> 33:23.470
I HAD IT STAGED AGAIN
WITH FURNITURE.

33:23.503 --> 33:26.973
I HELD AN OPEN HOUSE WITH CLOWNS
AND A WHOLE CARNIVAL THEME.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.375
AND I HATE CLOWNS.

33:28.408 --> 33:29.843
- MICHAEL, HOW YOU DOIN'?

33:29.876 --> 33:31.511
- HEY, DOUG, WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:33.213 --> 33:34.314
SO I'M SITTING HERE WITH, UH,

33:34.347 --> 33:35.982
I HAVE A BROKER
IN MY OFFICE,

33:36.082 --> 33:38.418
AND THEY HAVE SUBMITTED
AN OFFER TO ME TODAY.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.355
$7 1/2 MILLION.

33:44.357 --> 33:46.126
YEAH, I MEAN, I HAVE TO PRESENT
YOU WITH EVERY OFFER.

33:46.159 --> 33:47.527
THAT'S MY JOB.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.095
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THE ACTIVITY GOING ON.

33:49.095 --> 33:51.598
BUT I THINK--I THINK THEY'LL
COME UP MORE, YOU KNOW?

33:54.434 --> 33:55.902
I DON'T KNOW YUVAL
WELL AT ALL.

33:55.935 --> 33:57.370
AND I'VE BEEN TAKING
COMEDY LESSONS,

33:57.404 --> 33:59.606
SO WHAT BETTER PLACE TO TRY IT
THAN AT A NEGOTIATION

33:59.639 --> 34:00.840
WITH SOMEONE
YOU DON'T KNOW?

34:00.874 --> 34:02.409
WHAT CAN CUT THE ICE
BETTER THAN HUMOR?

34:02.442 --> 34:04.077
I MEAN, LET'S SAY THERE'S
A REAL ESTATE BROKER,

34:04.110 --> 34:06.046
A USED CAR SALESMAN,
AND A LAWYER.

34:06.046 --> 34:07.847
AND YOU HAVE A GUN
AND TWO BULLETS.

34:07.881 --> 34:08.848
WHAT DO YOU DO?

34:08.882 --> 34:10.083
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU TELL ME.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.218
- YOU SHOOT THE REAL ESTATE
BROKER TWICE.

34:15.388 --> 34:16.489
- I HEAR YOU.
I HEAR YOU.

34:16.523 --> 34:18.858
- OH, YOU'VE HEARD
THAT ONE BEFORE?

34:18.892 --> 34:21.428
I KNOW, I TRY TO INTERJECT--
INJECT HUMOR

34:21.461 --> 34:22.429
INTO ALL SITUATIONS.

34:22.462 --> 34:23.596
- DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY.

34:23.630 --> 34:25.198
- YES, LIKE KNOCK-KNOCK.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.199
- WHO'S THERE?

34:26.232 --> 34:27.534
- $9 MILLION.

34:27.567 --> 34:30.170
- YOU...MEAN...

34:30.203 --> 34:32.439
NUH-UH, 9 MILLION?

34:32.472 --> 34:34.341
THAT'S IT?
I MEAN...

34:34.374 --> 34:36.343
- YOU GUYS CAME IN
PRETTY LOW, TO BE HONEST.

34:36.376 --> 34:38.445
- CAN YOU DO A LITTLE BIT
BETTER, Y-YOU THINK?

34:38.478 --> 34:40.513
- WELL, I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA
NEGOTIATE WITH MYSELF NOW.

34:40.547 --> 34:41.381
I JUST CAME DOWN, I MEAN,

34:41.414 --> 34:42.682
YOU GOTTA COME BACK
WITH SOMETHING.

34:42.716 --> 34:44.217
DO YOU WANNA
MAYBE GO CALL THEM?

34:44.250 --> 34:46.152
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

34:49.122 --> 34:50.790
- YEAH, HI, IT'S YUVAL.

34:50.824 --> 34:54.427
THEY CAME DOWN TO 9,
FROM $9 MILLION, 9.50.

34:54.461 --> 34:56.296
YEAH.

34:56.329 --> 34:57.430
BUT--BUT I THINK THAT,
YOU KNOW,

34:57.464 --> 34:59.666
WE SHOULD GIVE OUR BEST
AND FINAL--BE FIRM ON THAT.

34:59.699 --> 35:01.134
OKAY.

35:06.473 --> 35:08.041
- YOU'RE BACK.
- HI, MICHAEL, YEAH.

35:10.477 --> 35:11.611
UM...

35:13.213 --> 35:14.581
- I-I--THEY...

35:15.949 --> 35:17.751
THEY CAN DO $8 1/2 MILLION.

35:22.155 --> 35:24.457
- 8 1/2.
SO IT CAME UP $1 MILLION.

35:24.491 --> 35:25.792
- TH-TH-THAT'S THEIR
BEST AND FINAL, MICHAEL.

35:25.825 --> 35:28.128
THEY'RE COMING UP A LOT.

35:28.161 --> 35:30.597
- I MEAN, THE BUYER JUMPED UP
$1 MILLION

35:30.630 --> 35:32.399
IN A MATTER OF, LIKE,
FIVE, TEN MINUTES.

35:32.432 --> 35:34.067
THIS IS A DEAL
THAT CAN BE DONE.

35:34.100 --> 35:35.301
TODAY.

35:35.335 --> 35:37.971
[phone rings]

35:41.374 --> 35:43.076
$8 1/2 MILLION.

35:44.277 --> 35:45.478
YEAH.
I KNOW DOUG.

35:45.512 --> 35:47.113
I KNOW WHAT HE PUT
INTO THIS BUILDING.

35:47.147 --> 35:48.581
HE BOUGHT THE BUILDING
FOR $4 MILLION.

35:48.615 --> 35:50.784
HE'S GETTING A GREAT RETURN
ON HIS PROPERTY.

35:50.817 --> 35:53.153
HE SHOULD SELL IT TODAY
AND MOVE ON.

35:53.186 --> 35:55.155
YOU KNOW, I FEEL
$8 1/2 MILLION'S

35:55.188 --> 35:58.291
REALLY A GREAT DEAL
FOR YOU.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.026
[sighs]

36:02.195 --> 36:03.530
OKAY.

36:04.764 --> 36:06.766
- SO YOU HAVE GOOD NEWS
FOR ME, RIGHT?

36:08.368 --> 36:09.703
- HOW MANY REAL ESTATE BROKERS
DOES IT TAKE

36:09.736 --> 36:11.037
TO SELL A TOWNHOUSE?

36:11.037 --> 36:12.205
- I DON'T KNOW.

36:15.041 --> 36:16.142
- JUST THE TWO OF US.

36:16.176 --> 36:17.744
- WE HAVE A DEAL?
- YEAH. THEY TOOK 8 1/2.

36:17.777 --> 36:19.112
- OKAY, BEAUTIFUL.
I LIKE IT.

36:19.145 --> 36:20.413
I LIKE IT.
I LIKE THAT ONE.

36:20.447 --> 36:22.048
- THAT WAS A GOOD DELIVERY.
- THAT WAS GOOD.

36:22.048 --> 36:23.817
- I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A REAL
JOURNEY GETTING THIS THING SOLD.

36:23.850 --> 36:24.951
AND I FINALLY DID IT.

36:25.051 --> 36:26.286
AND IT FEELS GREAT.

36:26.319 --> 36:27.253
WOULD YOU PAY,
LIKE, 10 BUCKS

36:27.287 --> 36:29.055
TO SEE ME PERFORM
LIVE COMEDY?

36:29.055 --> 36:30.557
- I THINK SO, I THINK SO.
PROBABLY.

36:30.590 --> 36:31.558
- [laughs]

36:31.591 --> 36:32.826
AWESOME.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.435
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, RYAN.
HOW ARE YOU?

36:42.469 --> 36:43.436
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

36:43.470 --> 36:45.071
I HOPE YOU HAVE
GOOD NEWS FOR ME.

36:45.071 --> 36:47.540
LESS THAN 48 HOURS AFTER SHOWING
GREENE STREET TO KAPTAN,

36:47.574 --> 36:49.976
HE CALLS ME AND SAYS
HE WANTS TO MEET WITH ME.

36:50.076 --> 36:51.211
GREENE STREET HAS GOT TO BE

36:51.244 --> 36:53.313
THE MOST STRESSFUL LISTING
I'VE EVER HAD.

36:53.346 --> 36:55.982
THERE ARE LITERALLY NO BIGGER
STAKES THAN THIS FOR ME.

36:56.082 --> 36:58.084
- SO I SPOKE TO THE BUYER.

36:58.084 --> 37:01.287
HE'S WILLING
TO MAKE AN OFFER...

37:01.321 --> 37:03.023
AT $16 MILLION.

37:06.693 --> 37:08.828
16? THAT'S IT?

37:08.862 --> 37:10.397
- ALL CASH.

37:10.430 --> 37:12.098
- THAT'S LIKE 1,300 A FOOT.

37:12.132 --> 37:14.267
- THE CLIENT'S NOT GONNA MOVE.
LIKE, I MEAN--

37:14.300 --> 37:16.036
- WELL, NEITHER AM I
GONNA MOVE.

37:16.036 --> 37:17.037
MY JOB
AS A REAL ESTATE AGENT

37:17.037 --> 37:19.039
IS TO PRESENT EVERY OFFER
TO MY CLIENT,

37:19.072 --> 37:20.173
NO MATTER HOW LOW.

37:20.206 --> 37:23.043
BUT...SOMETIMES, YOU GOTTA
FIGHT AS HARD AS YOU CAN

37:23.076 --> 37:25.612
WITH A BUYER BEFORE
YOU MAKE THAT FIRST CALL.

37:25.645 --> 37:26.813
- HERE'S THE OPTION.
HERE'S THE OPTION.

37:26.846 --> 37:29.049
READY?
THE LISTING IS MINE.

37:29.082 --> 37:31.051
SO I CAN HOLD ON TO IT,

37:31.051 --> 37:33.053
AND I'LL SELL IT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

37:33.053 --> 37:35.055
OR YOU COME UP.

37:38.692 --> 37:41.061
- LET ME SPEAK TO, UM...

37:41.061 --> 37:42.862
THE--THE BUYER.

37:42.896 --> 37:45.598
[phone line ringing]

37:48.268 --> 37:50.370
HEY, BILL.

37:50.403 --> 37:52.072
HEY, SO I'M HERE WITH RYAN,

37:52.072 --> 37:54.207
AND I'VE PUT THE OFFER IN.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.076
BUT HE'S QUITE,
YOU KNOW, FIRM.

37:56.076 --> 37:59.079
- I--I AM WISHING
THAT I WAS ON THAT PHONE,

37:59.079 --> 38:01.448
BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
I WOULD SAY TO THAT BUYER.

38:01.481 --> 38:04.617
AND I-I-I PRAY THAT KAPTAN'S
NOT [bleep] IT UP.

38:04.651 --> 38:09.055
- CONSIDERING THE MARKET RATE,
UH, $1,600, UM,

38:09.089 --> 38:10.256
PER SQUARE FEET,

38:10.290 --> 38:12.325
I MEAN, WE'RE LOOKING AT
19.2.

38:12.359 --> 38:15.695
WOULD YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT?

38:15.729 --> 38:18.031
- UM...

38:22.602 --> 38:26.039
- AT 1,600 PER SQUARE FEET,

38:26.072 --> 38:28.041
WE'RE LOOKING AT 19.2.

38:28.074 --> 38:30.110
- YOU ARE DEVILISHLY HANDSOME.

38:30.143 --> 38:31.878
- [laughs]
- YOU'RE AT 1,600.

38:31.911 --> 38:32.946
THAT'S COMPETITIVE,
AND I GET THAT,

38:33.046 --> 38:35.415
AND I RESPECT
YOUR PROFESSIONALISM.

38:35.448 --> 38:37.384
BUT $1,700 A FOOT, I THINK,
IS A PREMIUM PRICE.

38:37.417 --> 38:42.555
- THE BUYER WILL 100%
NOT GO OVER 20.

38:45.925 --> 38:48.094
- IF I SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE
WITH YOU, WHAT IS THAT?

38:48.128 --> 38:49.662
16.50 A FOOT.

38:49.696 --> 38:52.899
THAT'S 19, 8--
19.88.

38:52.932 --> 38:55.135
IF I COME BACK TO YOU
WITH 19.88,

38:55.168 --> 38:57.103
WILL YOU CONVINCE YOUR GUY
TO DO THE DEAL?

38:57.137 --> 38:59.139
- I'LL SPEAK TO HIM,
SEE WHAT HE SAYS.

39:01.675 --> 39:04.210
[phone line ringing]

39:06.146 --> 39:08.014
- HEY, KEN, IT'S RYAN.

39:09.149 --> 39:10.784
SO THEY HAVE AN OFFER FOR US.

39:10.817 --> 39:13.386
THEY'RE AT $19.2 MILLION.

39:15.155 --> 39:17.123
- OKAY, WHICH
IS $1,600 A FOOT.

39:17.157 --> 39:19.159
THEY'RE ALL CASH.

39:22.429 --> 39:23.596
- THEY'RE NOT GONNA
GO OVER 20.

39:23.630 --> 39:25.131
I KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW.

39:25.165 --> 39:26.666
SO WE CAN WALK AWAY...

39:26.700 --> 39:28.935
AND WE CAN WAIT
FOR THE NEXT ONE,

39:29.035 --> 39:31.104
OR WE CAN NEGOTIATE
WITH THEM.

39:31.137 --> 39:32.172
AND I THINK...

39:32.205 --> 39:35.175
I THINK IF WE COME AT $1,650,

39:35.208 --> 39:36.643
WE CAN DO A DEAL.

39:36.676 --> 39:39.112
AND THAT'S ABOUT $19.88.

39:43.450 --> 39:45.085
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO TAKE IT,

39:45.118 --> 39:46.186
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT,

39:46.219 --> 39:47.921
AND I'LL CONTINUE TO BRING YOU
MORE OFFERS.

39:47.954 --> 39:50.190
BUT I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
IF WE'RE GONNA GET ANOTHER OFFER

39:50.223 --> 39:52.359
THAT'S BETTER THAN THIS,
READY TO CLOSE IMMEDIATELY.

39:57.263 --> 40:00.266
IT'S A GOOD DEAL, KEN.
IT'S A GOOD DEAL.

40:07.874 --> 40:10.844
$19.88 MILLION.

40:10.877 --> 40:12.178
BEST AND FINAL.

40:12.212 --> 40:13.713
AND THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.

40:13.747 --> 40:15.248
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO MORE ROOM.

40:15.281 --> 40:16.683
- OKAY.

40:21.921 --> 40:27.394
- HE'S COMING BACK WITH 19.88.

40:34.267 --> 40:37.237
- OKAY, SO I SPOKE
TO THE BUYER.

40:37.270 --> 40:39.739
- YEAH.
- UM, AND...

40:41.274 --> 40:44.244
HE WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD
AND ACCEPT THE OFFER

40:44.277 --> 40:47.080
AT 19.88.

40:47.113 --> 40:48.248
CONGRATULATIONS.

40:48.281 --> 40:50.050
[laughs]

40:50.083 --> 40:52.485
- WHEW.

40:52.519 --> 40:53.720
GOOD.

40:53.753 --> 40:55.221
GOOD.

40:55.255 --> 40:56.423
NOW HE'S GOTTA FIGURE OUT

40:56.456 --> 40:57.757
HOW TO GET THAT MOTORCYCLE
OUT OF THERE.

40:57.791 --> 40:59.125
- [laughs]

41:07.434 --> 41:10.103
[phone line rings]

41:11.738 --> 41:12.872
- HEY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

41:15.108 --> 41:16.509
UH, HEADING OUT
TO THE HAMPTONS.

41:16.543 --> 41:18.611
UH, SOME GOOD NEWS--
WE GOT A DEAL DONE

41:18.645 --> 41:20.513
ON 33 CHARLTON STREET.

41:25.652 --> 41:26.653
[laughs] RIGHT.

41:26.686 --> 41:28.288
WITH THIS
$8.5 MILLION SALE,

41:28.321 --> 41:30.990
I FINALLY FEEL LIKE
I'VE GOT MY FOOT IN THE DOOR.

41:31.091 --> 41:33.293
I MEAN, IT'S THE BEST FEELING
TO EARN YOUR FATHER'S RESPECT.

41:33.326 --> 41:34.961
I THINK I'VE PROVED MYSELF,

41:34.994 --> 41:36.329
AND HE'S HAPPY
TO HAVE ME WITH HIM.

41:36.363 --> 41:39.099
BUT AS GREAT AS IT WAS
TO SELL CHARLTON STREET,

41:39.099 --> 41:40.333
IT WAS JUST
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

41:40.367 --> 41:41.835
HELLO.

41:41.868 --> 41:43.303
AFTER I COME BACK
FROM MY VACATION,

41:43.336 --> 41:45.672
I'M GONNA BE HITTING IT
BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER.

41:45.705 --> 41:48.341
MY BUSINESS IS REALLY
GONNA TAKE OFF.

41:53.213 --> 41:55.348
- EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T
MAKE THE SALE AT IRVING,

41:55.382 --> 41:57.650
THIS YEAR WAS SO INCREDIBLE.

41:57.684 --> 42:00.053
$1/2 BILLION IN SALES.

42:00.053 --> 42:02.389
IT'S THE HIGHEST SALES
IN MY ENTIRE CAREER.

42:02.422 --> 42:05.825
BUT...I THINK THE MOST
PIVOTAL MOMENT

42:05.859 --> 42:07.427
WHEN WHEN I WENT TO SWEDEN.

42:07.460 --> 42:09.062
