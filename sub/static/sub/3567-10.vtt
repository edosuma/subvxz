<i>W-water. Uh...
so thirsty...</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:13.487
- for water.
- It'll be safer if you

00:13.560 --> 00:18.557
- stand up and walk.
- You don't understand. This is how...

00:18.682 --> 00:22.523
you're supposed to act... in the desert.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.577
- Is this the thing? The place?
- Yes, Steven.

00:30.648 --> 00:34.371
- The power in this structure has turned aimless.
- It's building columns

00:34.442 --> 00:38.838
with no roofs ... stairs that go
nowhere. This is out of control.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.842
Then I guess we better...

00:40.946 --> 00:43.620
Whoops!
...roll on over there.

00:43.692 --> 00:47.961
- That was a bit unnecessary.
- Nan nani ni nun-nani nani!

00:47.996 --> 00:50.585
Excuse me?

00:50.657 --> 00:53.639
- What was that?
- Let's go!

00:53.640 --> 00:56.163
It'll be best if you
stay here, Steven.

00:56.164 --> 00:58.087
- We'll be quick.
- What if something eats me?

00:58.159 --> 01:01.747
Do not worry, wet one.

01:01.819 --> 01:05.200
There's nothing out here that
can harm you. See you soon.

01:05.272 --> 01:09.180
Okay.

01:09.252 --> 01:15.287
Whew! It's... so... desert.

01:18.151 --> 01:21.848
<i>What was that?</i>

01:23.555 --> 01:28.600
Nothing can harm me.
I am the wet one.

01:35.294 --> 01:40.364
Good thing this column was here.

01:40.434 --> 01:44.312
No, no, no!

01:46.414 --> 01:48.642
No! No!

01:49.929 --> 01:52.063
Huh?

01:57.573 --> 01:59.498

02:14.963 --> 02:19.294
Aww. You just wanted
attention. Didn't you?

02:19.399 --> 02:25.641
Didn't you? Your mane ...
it's so soft.

02:27.416 --> 02:28.866
So you from around here?

02:28.937 --> 02:33.957
I'm just here on business.
I really like your pink fur.

02:34.081 --> 02:36.811
You're like the cotton
candy of the jungle!

02:40.023 --> 02:43.613
I always wanted an animal
friend, but I thought ... ooh!

02:43.614 --> 02:48.121
... it would be like a goldfish
or a dinosaur!

02:48.156 --> 02:52.521
But I guess fate had other
plans for Steven Universe ... uhh! ...

02:52.556 --> 02:54.598
and his best friend lion.

02:56.991 --> 03:00.298
<i>- Amethyst, bubble it away!
- No!</i>

03:00.371 --> 03:05.369
- Quit being jealous, Pearl. My kill, my keep.
- I'm not jealous.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.369
Just be careful! If you drop it on
the sand, it'll rebuild everything!

03:10.441 --> 03:12.866
Garnet, Amethyst,
and Pearl are coming.

03:12.937 --> 03:16.528
- Quick, put my head in your mouth.
- Steven! What is that?!

03:16.600 --> 03:20.434
- What are you doing?!
- Uh... stop! It's okay!

03:20.541 --> 03:24.502
- Look, he's totally tame!
- That's impossible.

03:24.555 --> 03:27.877
No, it isn't. I
taught him to say "I love you."

03:27.878 --> 03:28.985
I love you.

03:29.057 --> 03:33.455
That's so sweet!
I-I love you, too.

03:33.528 --> 03:36.169
Get your hands out
of that thing's mouth.

03:36.170 --> 03:38.811
We have to get the desert
glass out of the desert!

03:38.812 --> 03:41.488
- I got it.
- Let's go, Steven.

03:41.559 --> 03:43.730
Okay. Give me a sec.

03:43.731 --> 03:48.074
Hey, lion, I got to go.
I had a lot of fun.

03:48.148 --> 03:51.915
I feel like you really get me.

03:53.207 --> 03:57.429
Shhhh. This is already too
hard for the both of us.

03:57.464 --> 04:00.502
<i>Amethyst, that
pillow needs to be contained!</i>

04:00.537 --> 04:03.558
<i>Yeah, yeah.
I know what to do with it.</i>

04:04.673 --> 04:10.869
- What's that sound?
- All I hear is your mouth.

04:10.904 --> 04:12.292
I thought gems don't need sleep.

04:12.365 --> 04:16.519
We don't.
Feels good, though.

04:16.593 --> 04:22.470
Probably some
kid trying to sell me lava insurance.

04:22.541 --> 04:26.170
Hold your britches!

04:26.205 --> 04:29.982
Lion! Oh! Oh, my gosh!
This is such a surprise!

04:30.113 --> 04:33.095
You came all this way
to see little old me?

04:33.201 --> 04:36.612
Whoa!
You're fresh.

04:36.684 --> 04:38.092
You can't go in there.

04:38.093 --> 04:40.909
Amethyst is pretend
sleeping. But whatevs.

04:40.981 --> 04:45.204
We're together again. Now we can
do everything best friends do!

04:45.310 --> 04:48.643
Okay, here I come! I'm gonna jump!

04:48.644 --> 04:50.585
<i>Get into position!</i>

04:50.620 --> 04:56.262
<i>Ready?! And... catch me!
I'm jumping!</i>

04:56.333 --> 04:59.370
Catch me! I'm falling!

04:59.405 --> 05:03.356
<i>Do it! Catch me!
I'll die! Eee!</i>

05:06.364 --> 05:10.885
<i>Okay, obviously,
you're not into this ...</i>

05:10.886 --> 05:15.406
<i>Wah! Uhh! Ooh!
... game. Okay!</i>

05:15.665 --> 05:22.423
Gonna throw this ball!
Here it comes!

05:22.494 --> 05:27.033
Whaaaat?!
That throw was so good!

05:27.068 --> 05:30.279
Lion, all you got to do is catch

05:30.352 --> 05:35.317
it in your mouth.
See? Aww.

05:35.388 --> 05:40.244
Pfft! Ugh. You don't like
that one, either? Okay, wait!

05:40.316 --> 05:44.154
I've got something you've
got to like! Fish stew pizza!

05:44.224 --> 05:47.521
Cats love fish. Everybody loves pizza.

05:47.522 --> 05:49.720
So you're gonna love this!

05:49.791 --> 05:52.974
Whoa! This place is jumpin'!

05:53.056 --> 05:56.278
Wait here.
We're gonna blow some minds.

05:56.419 --> 05:58.153
Hey, guys!

05:58.154 --> 06:02.177
I'm doing okay, you know?

06:02.212 --> 06:05.788
Just getting some pizza.
Kofi. Kiki.

06:06.023 --> 06:09.357
- What are you having, Steven?
- Large pizza, please. Extra fishy.

06:09.464 --> 06:13.126
- You must be hungry!
- I'm ordering for two.

06:13.198 --> 06:17.386
- Steven's pregnant?!
- I don't think so.

06:17.457 --> 06:22.349
- But I have a giant pet lion right outside!
- You're not lyin', are you?

06:22.422 --> 06:25.514
That's funny! But I'm not.

06:25.549 --> 06:28.549
I believe it! Lot's of weird
stuff happens in Beach City.

06:28.621 --> 06:32.447
You'd know if you read my
blog "keep Beach City weird"!

06:32.448 --> 06:34.360
I also have buttons!

06:34.466 --> 06:38.058
Just go outside,
and see for yourselves!

06:38.059 --> 06:41.651
- This is amazing!
- Mm-hmm!

06:41.652 --> 06:43.377
- It's invisible!
- Huh? What?

06:43.448 --> 06:47.178
He's not invisible. He's pink.

06:47.251 --> 06:49.681
Pink?
How can he be invisible and pink?

06:49.682 --> 06:54.841
There's nothing out here,
Ronaldo. Steven was lyin'.

06:55.076 --> 06:57.031
Sorry for using the same pun twice.

06:57.066 --> 06:59.774
- Bet you're not even pregnant.
- No, I'm telling the truth!

06:59.881 --> 07:04.558
He's real!
Onion, you believe me, right?

07:10.374 --> 07:12.468
Huh?

07:12.469 --> 07:16.662
Hey! Hey! Lion!
You left me at the pizza place!

07:16.663 --> 07:20.680
I looked like a fool!
I had to eat a whole pizza by myself!

07:22.641 --> 07:24.597
<i>Lion! Lion, no!</i>

07:26.806 --> 07:30.062
Lion?

07:30.097 --> 07:34.360
Uhh! Ahh.
Keep it down, Steven.

07:34.433 --> 07:36.364
What was that for?

07:37.352 --> 07:41.863
The pillow?
Is this what you wanted?

07:41.898 --> 07:46.056
This pillow? I've been trying to
play with you and feed you

07:46.127 --> 07:49.276
<i>'cause I thought we were best friends.</i>

07:49.277 --> 07:52.426
<i>Did all of that mean nothing to you?</i>

07:52.500 --> 07:55.632
Fine! I don't care!

07:55.703 --> 08:00.789
If you want it, you can have it!

08:05.947 --> 08:11.023
<i> Steven!
The desert glass!</i>

08:11.097 --> 08:14.536
It's rebuilding its castle.
Why didn't you bubble it earlier?

08:14.639 --> 08:17.982
- Welcome to shrug city, P.
- Don't move!

08:17.996 --> 08:21.543
- We're coming!
- Okay!

08:25.339 --> 08:28.934
Uhh! Huh?
There it is ... the pillow!

08:29.023 --> 08:31.839
I have to get it off the sand.

08:34.015 --> 08:36.830
Huh?

08:42.989 --> 08:45.437
This wall's not moving!

08:45.508 --> 08:51.250
- We got to get through before things get any ...
- Whoa!

09:07.685 --> 09:09.486
No!

09:12.635 --> 09:15.069
Lion!

09:16.906 --> 09:20.240
You didn't come here
to steal the pillow.

09:20.347 --> 09:24.632
You came here to protect us from it!

09:24.655 --> 09:27.779
It's there!
It's putting up defenses!

09:27.849 --> 09:30.120
How are we gonna get up there?!

09:32.108 --> 09:35.980
Yup. Sounds good.
Let's go.

09:47.173 --> 09:49.408
Now, lion!

09:49.409 --> 09:51.644
Whoo!

09:51.749 --> 09:54.745
Roar!

10:01.289 --> 10:03.374
We should have done
this in the first place.

10:03.730 --> 10:09.147
- In my defense, I forgot.
- So I guess this is goodbye.

10:09.182 --> 10:12.109
We had some good times.
But I'm sure you have other

10:12.215 --> 10:17.418
magical stuff to smash
with other magical boys.

10:17.419 --> 10:19.794
<i>I love you, Steven.</i>

10:19.829 --> 10:23.099
<i>I want to stay with you forever.</i>

10:23.100 --> 10:25.280
Really?!

10:25.350 --> 10:29.995
- Guys, you hear that?!
- Are we really going to let him keep that?

10:30.101 --> 10:33.577
- We kept Amethyst.
- Oh!

10:33.607 --> 10:39.751
"Kept Amethyst."
Oh, Garnet! That's priceless!

10:40.770 --> 10:43.367
Yay! Lion!
