00:14.656 --> 00:17.367
Dylan, are you sure it's a good idea
to go to an amusement park

00:17.487 --> 00:19.418
after just getting out of the hospital?
I mean

00:19.538 --> 00:22.715
we were kidnapped and man-handled
by a really mean man-crab.

00:23.118 --> 00:26.030
I believe it's crab-handled,
not man-handled.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.823
And it was all bogus, remember?
They caught the guy.

00:28.891 --> 00:31.726
Creepy, Spooky Terrorland
is totally safe.

00:31.794 --> 00:33.561
Besides, attendance is so bad,

00:33.629 --> 00:35.220
the tickets are super cheap.

00:35.288 --> 00:36.873
Hey, hey.

00:36.935 --> 00:40.764
Ride the Nauseator.
No waiting, ever.

00:45.214 --> 00:46.147
Oh!

00:46.215 --> 00:48.021
Hey, this thing is pretty--

00:48.089 --> 00:49.861
Aah!

00:49.929 --> 00:51.203
Oh!

00:51.271 --> 00:54.406
Oh, my sternum.

00:54.474 --> 00:55.742
Look at that view, Bren.

00:55.810 --> 00:58.184
You can see
all of Crystal Cove from here.

00:58.252 --> 01:00.021
You're right.
From up here,

01:00.089 --> 01:02.726
it doesn't look like
such a scary place to live.

01:02.794 --> 01:05.761
And maybe everything will turn
out all right for us.

01:05.829 --> 01:08.867
- Oh, Brenda.
- Oh, Dylan.

01:12.369 --> 01:15.103
Let's table
our emotional embrace.

01:15.171 --> 01:20.374
Totes. At least
we're together and safe.

01:23.276 --> 01:24.276
Aah!

01:26.682 --> 01:30.784
These grounds are now
the domain of the Manticore.

01:30.852 --> 01:33.120
Aah!

01:33.188 --> 01:38.327
Hey, hey. Ride the Nauseator.
No waiting, ever.

03:16.134 --> 03:19.337
If I'd known this was all it'd
take to get your attention,

03:19.405 --> 03:21.239
I'd have just rung the bell.

03:21.307 --> 03:23.975
I want to see
Mr. E., now.

03:38.891 --> 03:42.226
The Mystery, Inc. kids have found a piece
of the planospheric disc.

03:42.294 --> 03:45.230
So now, we know
where 2 of the pieces are.

03:45.298 --> 03:46.631
Good work, Angel.

03:46.699 --> 03:50.135
Just remember, I'm working with you,
not for you, E.

03:50.203 --> 03:51.870
I'm worried about those kids.

03:51.938 --> 03:52.871
Why?

03:52.939 --> 03:54.373
Pericles is loose,

03:54.441 --> 03:56.709
and that nutso parrot might go
after the piece,

03:56.777 --> 03:58.711
which puts them in danger--

03:58.779 --> 04:01.581
And us, if the former members
of our club get wind of it.

04:01.649 --> 04:03.050
Don't worry, little Angel.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.952
The other 2 won't move a muscle

04:05.019 --> 04:08.188
as long as Fred Jones
is still alive.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.593
Look, this isn't easy for me,

04:13.661 --> 04:15.261
but I need your help.

04:15.329 --> 04:17.430
Our help? Dad.

04:17.498 --> 04:19.531
Are we...bonding?

04:19.600 --> 04:22.868
Look at me!
I'm shaking!

04:22.936 --> 04:26.773
Galloping gopher ponies, Fred.
Don't get all girly on me.

04:26.841 --> 04:29.109
I asked you here because

04:29.176 --> 04:31.111
this Manticore problem
may be my fault.

04:31.179 --> 04:32.446
Your fault?

04:32.513 --> 04:33.947
I was looking around the Internet

04:34.015 --> 04:35.282
for something that might help
the park

04:35.350 --> 04:39.120
when I found
hauntedattractions-forsale.scared,

04:39.187 --> 04:43.458
advertising an ancient Persian
temple haunted by a Manticore.

04:43.525 --> 04:45.959
Oh, come on.

04:46.027 --> 04:48.428
Who buys a temple
on the Internet?

04:49.330 --> 04:50.330
Sorry, sir.

04:50.398 --> 04:51.665
It was a deal.

04:51.733 --> 04:53.000
I paid the owners of the temple

04:53.067 --> 04:54.334
in leftover
Que Horiffico t-shirts,

04:54.402 --> 04:56.002
and they shipped
the temple up here.

04:56.070 --> 04:58.671
Seemed like a good idea
at the time to boost tourism,

04:58.739 --> 05:02.040
but now, it appears that a Manticore
is actually eating tourists.

05:02.108 --> 05:04.276
What can I say?
Buyer's remorse.

05:04.343 --> 05:06.711
We'll do it!
We'll fix this for you.

05:06.779 --> 05:08.547
I can't tell you
what it means to me

05:08.615 --> 05:10.984
that you're actually asking
for our help.

05:11.051 --> 05:12.686
This is going to be great, dad.

05:12.753 --> 05:14.688
We'll go on
team stakeouts together.

05:14.755 --> 05:16.690
We'll build traps together.

05:16.757 --> 05:19.959
Yeah. I won't be taking part
in any of that.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.229
Understood.

05:22.296 --> 05:24.865
But I know
you'll be there in spirit.

05:29.304 --> 05:31.539
Let's wrap this one up
neat and fast, gang.

05:31.607 --> 05:33.274
My dad's counting on us.

05:33.342 --> 05:36.177
We're running a special
on our nefarious nachos.

05:36.244 --> 05:38.412
Where?

05:40.081 --> 05:43.350
Sorry, mister.
Which way did he say the nachos were?

05:43.418 --> 05:44.652
Not now, Shaggy.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.322
We're here to solidify
my relationship with my father.

05:49.924 --> 05:51.692
And save the amusement park.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.363
I'm afraid Creepy, Spooky
Terrorland may be beyond saving.

05:56.431 --> 05:58.265
Oh, I'm the owner,
Winslow Fleach,

05:58.333 --> 05:59.933
and this is my daughter.

06:00.001 --> 06:01.435
Hot Dog Water.

06:01.503 --> 06:03.604
Hello, Velma.

06:03.671 --> 06:05.773
Hot Dog Water?

06:05.840 --> 06:08.275
Is that some sort of nickname,
honey?

06:08.342 --> 06:10.510
Look, sometimes,
I recycle the water

06:10.578 --> 06:12.612
we boil the park's hot dogs in
for bathing,

06:12.680 --> 06:13.947
to save money,
but...heh.

06:14.015 --> 06:17.284
It's OK, dad.
We don't need to explain our ways.

06:17.351 --> 06:21.956
Besides, Velma and I are old friends
from the science fair circuit.

06:22.023 --> 06:25.960
Yeah. Sorry about
beating you again this year.

06:26.028 --> 06:30.064
Well...[Sighs] It might be the last
science fair you compete in, darling.

06:30.132 --> 06:33.301
With the park going under,
I'll never be able to pay for college.

06:33.368 --> 06:35.002
It's that bad?

06:35.070 --> 06:37.405
I've constructed
a detailed financial model,

06:37.473 --> 06:40.074
taking into account
300 variables,

06:40.142 --> 06:42.244
and they all say the same thing.

06:42.311 --> 06:44.112
Close the park, immediately.

06:44.180 --> 06:46.214
Oh, no, no.
Wait. Please.

06:46.282 --> 06:47.950
Can't you just hold off
a little while

06:48.017 --> 06:49.484
and give us a chance
to investigate?

06:49.552 --> 06:52.955
Well, I suppose I can't get
any more broke.

06:53.023 --> 06:54.290
All right.

06:54.357 --> 06:56.692
Can we go investigate the nachos?

06:56.760 --> 06:59.629
No. We're going to start
where this all started--

06:59.697 --> 07:01.498
The temple.

07:08.104 --> 07:11.206
Like, we would have been better
off investigating the nachos.

07:11.273 --> 07:15.276
You can learn a lot from
artificially flavored cheese sauce.

07:16.211 --> 07:17.812
Uh-huh!

07:17.879 --> 07:19.646
Learning is yummy!

07:19.714 --> 07:21.848
Guys, this temple is
our only lead,

07:21.916 --> 07:24.552
and we shouldn't stop until
we've seen every inch of...

07:24.619 --> 07:26.019
it.

07:33.229 --> 07:36.498
You know, even for a place called
Creepy, Spooky Terrorland,

07:36.566 --> 07:38.167
this is pretty scary.

07:38.234 --> 07:39.935
Look at those shadows up there.

07:40.003 --> 07:42.038
That's a perfect place
for a trap.

07:42.106 --> 07:44.540
Be gone!

07:45.909 --> 07:47.510
Or a Manticore.

07:50.578 --> 07:53.814
I will feast on your bones.

07:53.882 --> 07:55.149
Aah!

07:55.217 --> 07:56.952
Awesome!

07:57.019 --> 07:59.154
My dad is going to be stoked.

07:59.222 --> 08:00.656
Hey, wait!
Where are you going?

08:05.529 --> 08:06.929
Faster!

08:06.997 --> 08:10.600
Like, if we had gone
to investigate the nachos,

08:10.667 --> 08:12.702
none of this would have happened.

08:12.769 --> 08:15.037
Through here!

08:19.075 --> 08:20.675
We lost it.

08:20.743 --> 08:22.277
Guys, what are you doing?

08:22.344 --> 08:24.679
Let's get back out there
and catch that thing.

08:24.747 --> 08:27.181
All we need is bait.

08:27.249 --> 08:29.583
Who here has
the most delicious bones?

08:29.651 --> 08:32.688
- Freddy!
- Hey, gang, look at this.

08:32.755 --> 08:35.756
They turned this temple into an
amusement park ride, remember?

08:35.825 --> 08:39.428
All we have to do is ride the
ride and get off at the exit.

08:39.496 --> 08:42.097
Like, already on it.
Hop in, everybody.

08:42.164 --> 08:45.134
Scooby-Doo,
hit the power.

08:45.202 --> 08:46.736
You got it.

08:54.244 --> 08:59.448
Ahh. This is, like, the only
way to get away from monsters.

08:59.516 --> 09:00.883
Aah!

09:00.951 --> 09:04.119
On second thought,
there's probably a better way!

09:04.187 --> 09:05.354
Aah!

09:08.024 --> 09:09.458
Aah!

09:16.032 --> 09:17.800
Everybody, get ready!

09:17.868 --> 09:19.068
Jump!

09:21.037 --> 09:25.040
Infernal contraption!
Release me!

09:26.209 --> 09:28.812
That was, like, way too close!

09:28.879 --> 09:31.013
Tell me about it.
Phew!

09:31.081 --> 09:34.283
We're going to have to get closer if
we're going to solve this mystery.

09:34.351 --> 09:37.987
First, we need to find out more
about this temple my dad bought.

09:40.557 --> 09:41.590
A manti-what?

09:41.658 --> 09:44.193
Manticore.
It's got the body of a lion,

09:44.261 --> 09:47.530
dragon wings, scorpion tail,
and a terrifying man face.

09:47.598 --> 09:49.865
My dad bought it
with some t-shirts online.

09:49.933 --> 09:53.202
Outsourcing monsters.
Sounds like the Mayor.

09:53.270 --> 09:55.371
What was the name
of that site? Oh, yeah...

09:55.439 --> 09:58.374
Hauntedattractions-forsale.scared.

09:58.442 --> 09:59.875
Here it is.

09:59.943 --> 10:02.645
Hmm. Looks like the temple was
the last thing they had to sell.

10:02.712 --> 10:04.380
It says they're closed.

10:04.447 --> 10:07.950
It says a lot more than that.
This website is a fake.

10:08.018 --> 10:09.452
Like, how can you tell?

10:09.519 --> 10:12.556
- All these photos of
so-called haunted attractions?

10:12.623 --> 10:14.725
Don't they look familiar?

10:14.792 --> 10:17.895
- Hey, that's not a life-sized,
possessed tribal idol,

10:17.962 --> 10:19.630
it's the Statue of Liberty.

10:19.698 --> 10:22.801
- Someone went to a lot of trouble
to put this site together--

10:22.868 --> 10:25.604
someone with serious
computer expertise.

10:25.671 --> 10:30.942
I'm starting to think we might not be
dealing with a real Manticore here.

10:31.010 --> 10:32.611
I think you're right, Daphne.

10:32.678 --> 10:34.980
You and Velma and I better go
back to my dad's office

10:35.047 --> 10:36.348
and ask some more questions.

10:36.416 --> 10:39.517
Shaggy, you and Scooby head over
to Creepy, Spooky Terrorland.

10:39.585 --> 10:41.352
There may be more clues there.

10:41.420 --> 10:42.620
- Great.
- Great.

10:42.688 --> 10:45.523
And don't start with the nachos.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.758
- Aww!
- Aww! Shoot!

10:49.627 --> 10:51.262
Hang back a second, girl.

10:52.597 --> 10:55.166
You tell the rest of the gang
about our little secret?

10:55.234 --> 10:58.036
You mean that your real name
is Cassidy Williams,

10:58.104 --> 11:01.040
and you're an original member
of Mystery, Incorporated?

11:01.108 --> 11:03.109
No, I haven't,

11:03.177 --> 11:05.178
because you said
you were going to do it.

11:05.246 --> 11:08.349
Soon as things are safe, baby.
Which reminds me,

11:08.416 --> 11:10.184
you still have
that weird piece of disc

11:10.252 --> 11:12.019
you found in
the old Darrow Mansion?

11:12.087 --> 11:13.788
Fred has it.
He hid it somewhere.

11:13.856 --> 11:16.190
Good.
As long as it's safe.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.524
Safe from whom?

11:17.592 --> 11:19.527
Child, it's best right now

11:19.595 --> 11:21.763
if you didn't know
the answer to that.

11:31.306 --> 11:33.074
Dad.

11:33.142 --> 11:34.242
What are you doing?

11:34.310 --> 11:35.743
- Oh! Oh. Just--uh,

11:35.811 --> 11:38.346
just studying plans
for my mayoral library

11:38.414 --> 11:40.047
that will be built
after my term's over.

11:40.115 --> 11:43.918
Um, only presidents get libraries
when their terms end, sir.

11:43.986 --> 11:48.557
Yes. That's why
I'm voting no on the library.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.391
So, have you solved
my Manticore problem?

11:50.459 --> 11:52.227
- Mr. Mayor,
we were wondering--

11:52.295 --> 11:55.630
Did someone tell you about the
website you used to buy the temple?

11:55.698 --> 11:58.733
No, I just typed "haunted
attractions" into the search engine.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.070
And you didn't notice anything
unusual about the website?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.472
No.

12:04.540 --> 12:05.874
Well, if you think of anything,

12:05.942 --> 12:07.275
you'll call me.
Right, dad?

12:07.343 --> 12:10.913
Sure. You or Velma.
Probably Velma.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.082
Just keep working on this
Manticore thing, all right?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.984
You got it, dad.

12:25.495 --> 12:29.999
Well, like, I guess there's no
clues in the cotton candy. Ha ha!

12:30.067 --> 12:33.035
Nope!
Just sugary goodness.

12:33.103 --> 12:38.341
What other snacks can we investigate
that aren't, like, nachos?

12:40.344 --> 12:42.713
Those churros look suspicious.

12:42.781 --> 12:44.648
- Good spotting,
Scooby-Doo.

12:44.716 --> 12:47.785
Let's interrogate them
in our bellies.

12:50.955 --> 12:53.390
Eww. You smell that, Scoob?

12:53.458 --> 12:56.794
P.U.!
I just lost my appetite.

12:56.861 --> 13:01.231
How many plushie char-gar Gothicon
dolls do we still have to get rid of?

13:01.299 --> 13:03.567
About 5,000.

13:06.837 --> 13:09.339
We'll give away 5
with every churro purchased.

13:09.407 --> 13:10.841
Good plan, dad,

13:10.909 --> 13:13.278
especially since
Velma and her friends

13:13.345 --> 13:16.415
haven't been able to solve
our Manticore problem.

13:19.319 --> 13:21.154
Hot Dog Water's right.

13:21.222 --> 13:23.757
We need to focus.
Concentrate.

13:23.825 --> 13:26.394
Yeah.
Let's find some clues.

13:34.602 --> 13:35.869
Phew.

13:35.937 --> 13:38.571
Yeah. This is, like,
hard work.

13:38.639 --> 13:40.507
How about a break, Scoob?

13:40.574 --> 13:42.676
Ok. Whoo-hoo!

13:42.743 --> 13:44.911
Roller coaster!

13:49.283 --> 13:50.884
Actually, this is, like,

13:50.952 --> 13:54.455
as good of a place to search
for clues as anywhere else.

13:54.523 --> 13:55.823
Good point, Raggy.

13:55.891 --> 13:58.093
I mean, who's to say
that up here,

13:58.160 --> 14:00.629
we won't find some sign of the...

14:00.697 --> 14:01.630
Ohh!

14:01.698 --> 14:04.300
The Manticore!

14:05.803 --> 14:08.739
Farewell, mortals.

14:23.053 --> 14:26.156
Once again, to your doom.

14:26.223 --> 14:27.890
Scoob!

14:27.958 --> 14:29.826
This isn't good!

14:29.894 --> 14:32.996
No. Not good.

14:33.064 --> 14:34.498
But this is worse!

14:48.415 --> 14:50.916
Oh, thank goodness you're alive!

14:50.984 --> 14:53.252
By the way, you owe me
for those 3 rides.

14:57.091 --> 14:58.359
What happened, you guys?

14:58.426 --> 15:00.694
It was, like, the Manticore!

15:00.762 --> 15:02.863
Yeah. He grabbed us.

15:02.931 --> 15:04.866
What's with the voices, you two?

15:04.934 --> 15:07.869
You sound like you've been
sucking on helium balloons.

15:07.937 --> 15:11.506
Maybe this is what happens when
you inhale too much Manticore.

15:11.574 --> 15:13.274
- Hmm.
- That's it.

15:13.342 --> 15:17.044
I am closing this park
right this very second.

15:17.112 --> 15:18.312
Good idea, dad.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.980
I can't stand
seeing you like this,

15:20.048 --> 15:21.715
and we don't want anyone else
to get hurt.

15:21.783 --> 15:24.284
No way!
I'm not letting you shut down

15:24.351 --> 15:25.919
Creepy, Spooky Terrorland.

15:25.986 --> 15:27.086
Huh?

15:27.154 --> 15:29.522
My father wants this park
to succeed,

15:29.590 --> 15:31.758
and he's counting on me
and my friends

15:31.825 --> 15:33.593
to help make sure
that that happens.

15:33.661 --> 15:34.995
And I am not going
to let him down,

15:35.062 --> 15:37.764
especially now that
we've become so close.

15:37.832 --> 15:40.167
It sounds like
you've got a plan, Freddy.

15:40.235 --> 15:44.239
I do. I know just what we need
to trap this Manticore.

15:46.709 --> 15:50.779
Ok. While Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby
are prepping the Manticore bait,

15:50.847 --> 15:52.748
we just need
to grab a few things.

15:52.815 --> 15:54.749
- Like?
- Rope, a stapler,

15:54.817 --> 15:57.018
tennis rackets,
and 4 pounds of Halibut.

15:57.086 --> 15:59.521
Uh, the Halibut's in my room
for emergency reasons.

15:59.589 --> 16:02.625
Velma, you get that,
and I'll get the rest.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.431
Mayor Jones?

16:08.499 --> 16:10.933
Oh! Aha. Ahh, Velma.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.871
I was just, um, looking for my
receipt for that crazy temple.

16:14.938 --> 16:16.539
In Fred's drawers?

16:16.607 --> 16:19.709
Yes. Well, it's always
the last place you look.

16:19.777 --> 16:21.277
Isn't that what they say?

16:21.345 --> 16:24.848
But unfortunately, not here.
Excuse me.

16:30.354 --> 16:32.855
Got 'em. Good.
Let's go.

16:34.224 --> 16:36.326
Fred, just curious.

16:36.393 --> 16:38.161
You know
that disc piece we found?

16:38.228 --> 16:39.662
What did you do with it?

16:39.730 --> 16:42.965
Huh? Oh. I gave it
to Shaggy and Scooby.

16:43.033 --> 16:44.234
- You what?
- Well,

16:44.302 --> 16:46.136
they're the last people
anyone would suspect

16:46.204 --> 16:48.138
of having
anything important, right?

16:48.205 --> 16:52.376
Wow. That's actually
kind of genius.

16:52.443 --> 16:55.212
Sometimes you astound me,
Freddy Jones.

16:56.748 --> 17:00.585
I can't take much more of this.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.654
Me neither.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.856
This is the last of
the nacho cheese, guys.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.724
You can't eat this coating.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.362
You guys look perfect!

17:11.263 --> 17:14.599
Why are we, like,
doing this again?

17:14.666 --> 17:16.434
Well, as everyone knows,

17:16.502 --> 17:19.936
Manticores have a legendary
fondness for human flesh.

17:20.005 --> 17:22.039
The Halibut
and spicy cheese sauce?

17:22.107 --> 17:24.608
It's kind of
my own special touch.

17:24.675 --> 17:27.944
Must not lick self.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.614
Must be--

17:30.682 --> 17:33.550
S-s-strong.

17:33.618 --> 17:36.219
You guys will walk back and
forth in front of the temple,

17:36.287 --> 17:38.155
luring the Manticore out.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.223
Then, we'll bash it
with tennis rackets

17:40.291 --> 17:43.059
and staple its wings
to the ground. Sound good?

17:51.369 --> 17:53.470
Oh. Like, oops.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.073
- Now what are we going--

17:56.141 --> 17:58.408
You guys smell that?

17:58.476 --> 18:00.643
- Smells like...
- Manticore!

18:00.711 --> 18:03.379
- No. Wait. I got it--
Ohh!

18:04.982 --> 18:07.249
Aah!

18:07.317 --> 18:08.751
Daphne!

18:18.128 --> 18:21.798
Oh! Oh!

18:21.866 --> 18:23.467
Aah!

18:31.678 --> 18:33.778
Gotcha! Oh!

18:33.846 --> 18:35.146
Got you!

18:40.654 --> 18:44.456
Like,
who's going to get me?

18:48.026 --> 18:50.361
I'll save you, Shaggy!

18:52.531 --> 18:54.732
Ohh.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.468
- Yeah! Ride 'em,
Scooby-Doo!

18:57.536 --> 19:00.871
Thanks! I'm trying!

19:03.942 --> 19:07.712
- You are doomed,
flea-covered one! Doomed!

19:07.779 --> 19:10.147
Whoa!

19:10.215 --> 19:12.650
- Aah!
- Aah!

19:12.718 --> 19:14.018
No, fool!

19:14.086 --> 19:16.621
No!

19:29.168 --> 19:32.370
- Look at that!
Are Manticores double-jointed?

19:32.438 --> 19:34.205
This is no Manticore, Daphne.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.308
This is...

19:36.376 --> 19:37.810
Hot Dog Water?

19:37.878 --> 19:39.979
Just as I suspected.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.815
It totally makes sense
when you put the clues together.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.151
Someone with computer skills
had to make that fake website,

19:46.219 --> 19:48.988
and Hot Dog Water has
those skills.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.824
And remember, just before
the Manticore attacked,

19:51.891 --> 19:53.659
I smelled something familiar.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.561
It was briny, greasy
Hot Dog Water.

19:56.629 --> 20:00.665
But what I don't know is why Shaggy
and Scooby had such high voices

20:00.732 --> 20:02.266
after you attacked them before,

20:02.333 --> 20:05.302
or why you'd want this amusement
park to close so badly.

20:05.369 --> 20:09.973
How could you know?
Your intellect is so far inferior to mine.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.742
It all started
on a boring Friday night

20:12.810 --> 20:14.144
when I didn't have a date.

20:14.211 --> 20:15.479
Hard to imagine.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.248
I decided to run some experiments

20:17.315 --> 20:19.817
on the steel used
to build the park's rides.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.487
I found that
if you melted the steel down

20:22.555 --> 20:26.325
and combined it with chromium,
stalagnite, and Mercury phosphate,

20:26.392 --> 20:29.095
it created a kind
of super helium.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.831
Shaggy and Scooby must have
inhaled some helium gas

20:31.899 --> 20:34.667
from the Manticore's
posterior relief hole.

20:34.735 --> 20:37.270
That's why their voices were
so high.

20:37.338 --> 20:39.605
I figured if I could get
the park to close,

20:39.673 --> 20:42.274
I could take all the steel,
melt it down,

20:42.342 --> 20:45.944
and sell the super helium to
the Australian zeppelin fleet.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.780
I'd have made a fortune

20:48.848 --> 20:51.649
and shown you up
in the process, Velma.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.756
Another mystery solved.

20:58.824 --> 21:01.559
It still seems like
something's missing.

21:04.195 --> 21:08.932
"Meddling kids and their dog
will foil your plan."

21:09.000 --> 21:10.600
Yep. That would be it.

21:13.705 --> 21:15.973
I know who has
the planospheric disc piece,

21:16.041 --> 21:18.076
but not where.

21:18.143 --> 21:19.744
Speak.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.314
I put a bug on Velma
when I saw her earlier.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.916
She didn't suspect a thing.

21:23.984 --> 21:25.584
Later, I heard Fred tell her

21:25.652 --> 21:27.853
that Shaggy and Scooby have
the piece.

21:27.921 --> 21:29.923
But he didn't say
anything more than that.

21:29.990 --> 21:33.426
He told Velma and us enough.

21:33.494 --> 21:36.930
Everything will work out
just fine.

21:36.997 --> 21:40.600
You see, Scooby is
a far more trusting companion

21:40.668 --> 21:43.636
than Pericles was to me.
