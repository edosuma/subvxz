00:34.786 --> 00:36.344
Yo, man, what's going on?

00:36.420 --> 00:38.581
Oh, I found this crystal
on our doorstep.

00:38.654 --> 00:39.814
It's pretty mysterious.

00:39.888 --> 00:41.719
I'm trying to find
information about it

00:41.789 --> 00:42.847
using the holo-book.

00:42.922 --> 00:44.150
Uh, that's cool.

00:44.222 --> 00:45.780
But you know what's really cool?

00:45.856 --> 00:47.687
Tough guy contests.

00:47.757 --> 00:48.780
Whoo-hoo!

00:48.857 --> 00:49.688
♪ Tough boys! ♪

00:49.757 --> 00:50.757
Wait, man.

00:50.825 --> 00:53.122
Doesn't this look like
Tree Trunks' lipstick?

00:53.192 --> 00:54.523
That's impossible.

00:54.593 --> 00:56.527
Tree Trunks exploded in
the scary dark forest

00:56.594 --> 00:59.426
after she ate that
crystal gem apple.

00:59.494 --> 01:00.393
Remember?

01:00.462 --> 01:02.292
Yeah, I remember.

01:02.362 --> 01:03.954
Come on, man.

01:04.029 --> 01:05.553
Tough-guy-contest me.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.825
You got what it takes to rip it?

01:07.898 --> 01:09.559
Uh... yeah.

01:09.632 --> 01:12.031
Then let's get it on.

01:13.499 --> 01:15.467
Hyah! Yeah-yo!

01:15.534 --> 01:16.534
Hyah!

01:18.435 --> 01:20.335
Do it, man. Do it.

01:20.402 --> 01:21.801
Raaa!

01:26.037 --> 01:27.037
Oh!

01:28.972 --> 01:33.271
No!

01:37.542 --> 01:38.736
Gotcha, dude.

01:38.809 --> 01:40.401
I'm gonna break out.

01:40.476 --> 01:41.408
No way.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.375
Ha ha!

01:42.444 --> 01:43.968
I'm breaking out with my fat.

01:44.044 --> 01:46.978
I win, Finn. Finn?

01:48.179 --> 01:49.044
Finn!

01:49.113 --> 01:50.205
Finn, are you okay?

01:51.447 --> 01:53.937
I was just messing
with you, dude.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.676
I... was just messing with...

01:56.749 --> 01:58.410
you.

02:00.050 --> 02:01.347
Are you okay?

02:01.417 --> 02:02.417
Yeah.

02:03.584 --> 02:05.347
I'm just gonna rest my muscles.

02:05.418 --> 02:06.942
Oh, dang it, Jake.

02:07.019 --> 02:09.714
You can't get all out
of control like that.

02:09.786 --> 02:11.947
Why am I like this...

02:12.021 --> 02:12.851
like this...

02:12.921 --> 02:13.921
like this?

02:15.922 --> 02:18.390
Jake, what did you
do to your brother?

02:18.457 --> 02:22.289
We were just playing, and
then I got out of control.

02:22.358 --> 02:23.451
I'm sorry, dad.

02:23.524 --> 02:25.253
No, son, you did good.

02:25.325 --> 02:28.725
Having no self-control makes
you a tough galoot, like me.

02:28.793 --> 02:30.886
But I don't want to hurt nobody.

02:30.961 --> 02:32.360
Well, that's too bad, kid,

02:32.428 --> 02:34.259
'cause you're gonna
hurt everybody.

02:34.329 --> 02:37.320
Noooo!

02:38.464 --> 02:40.329
Whatev, daddy.

02:40.398 --> 02:42.956
Hmph! Hmph! Hmph!

02:43.032 --> 02:48.899
I'm never gonna hurt anybody ever...
starting now.

03:01.171 --> 03:02.070
What's up, dude?

03:02.139 --> 03:03.504
Finn, you're okay.

03:03.573 --> 03:05.370
I was scared that I
mashed your potatoes

03:05.440 --> 03:06.668
too hard last night.

03:06.741 --> 03:09.004
Ha! You didn't mash my potatoes.

03:09.074 --> 03:10.564
You didn't even make
me cry silently

03:10.642 --> 03:12.075
into my pillow last night for...

03:12.142 --> 03:13.371
30 minutes.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.104
In fact, you ready to
go again, tough stuff?

03:16.177 --> 03:18.508
No. No more, dude. - What?

03:18.578 --> 03:21.240
I never want to lose
control again, man.

03:21.313 --> 03:23.576
I'm going totally soft.

03:23.647 --> 03:24.909
You look like a wuss.

03:24.980 --> 03:25.980
Mm-hmm.

03:28.015 --> 03:30.142
Hey, the crystal's glowing
a different color.

03:32.150 --> 03:33.378
Hmm.

03:33.450 --> 03:34.280
Jake!

03:34.350 --> 03:35.681
Whoa.

03:35.751 --> 03:36.751
What's it...

03:40.053 --> 03:41.053
Chip, chap, chop!

03:41.120 --> 03:42.178
What's going on?

03:42.253 --> 03:44.846
Uh, which one of you
is Finn the human?

03:44.920 --> 03:46.512
Depends on who's asking.

03:46.588 --> 03:47.919
Are y'all good or evil?

03:47.988 --> 03:49.320
Uh... we're good.

03:49.390 --> 03:51.017
Oh. I'm Finn.

03:51.089 --> 03:52.557
- Get him!
- Aah!

03:52.623 --> 03:55.091
Hey, you guys, put my bro down.

03:55.158 --> 03:56.785
Jake!

03:56.859 --> 03:58.554
Finn!

04:01.694 --> 04:03.854
Ugh! - Hey.

04:03.927 --> 04:05.554
Hey, man, what happened?

04:05.628 --> 04:07.605
I don't know, but I'm trapped
in this crystal ball.

04:07.629 --> 04:09.654
Get me out of here.

04:09.730 --> 04:13.755
Okay, I'll try to do it using
controlled conversation.

04:13.831 --> 04:14.763
Halt.

04:14.831 --> 04:16.423
Hey, man, I'm Jake.

04:16.499 --> 04:17.829
Beat it.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.833
I want to know why
you took my buddy,

04:19.899 --> 04:21.423
and I'm not gonna use force

04:21.500 --> 04:22.866
to get it out of you.

04:22.934 --> 04:24.799
I'm just following orders, bub.

04:24.869 --> 04:26.131
Whose orders?

04:26.202 --> 04:27.692
Um... well, it's a secret,

04:27.770 --> 04:29.704
but part of it is
we're turning Finn

04:29.771 --> 04:30.771
into a crystal.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.101
Jake, you should
stop these guys now.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.105
Aaaaah!

04:35.172 --> 04:36.434
Oh, man.

04:36.506 --> 04:37.769
Get me out of here!

04:37.840 --> 04:40.831
No. You're gonna look awesome
and crystal, like us.

04:40.908 --> 04:42.932
Can't we work this
out like gents?

04:43.008 --> 04:44.976
Get lost. - Whoa!

04:45.976 --> 04:48.706
Jake, lose control,
flip out on those guys.

04:48.778 --> 04:50.268
No, dad.

04:50.345 --> 04:52.676
I've got to control myself.

04:52.745 --> 04:56.202
♪ Control, control,
control, control ♪

04:57.480 --> 04:59.107
Jake! Help!

04:59.181 --> 05:01.648
My arm! Aah!

05:01.715 --> 05:03.376
Whoa. Okay, okay.

05:03.449 --> 05:05.781
I'm hatching a controlled plan.

05:05.850 --> 05:07.783
All right, man,
move out of the way

05:07.850 --> 05:09.715
and let me get my friend.

05:09.785 --> 05:10.911
Nope. Not doing it.

05:10.985 --> 05:13.351
Then I'll have to
move you myself...

05:13.420 --> 05:16.081
with my mind.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.756
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Stop it.

05:29.925 --> 05:32.291
Your time is running
out, little dog.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.725
Hey, speed it up in there, guys.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.728
Okay. Turn up the juice, mang.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.092
Yeah, mang.

05:39.162 --> 05:41.357
Aah. Aah!

05:41.430 --> 05:42.988
Jake! Help!

05:43.064 --> 05:44.691
Finn!

05:44.764 --> 05:46.391
Don't hurt my buddy.

05:47.465 --> 05:49.490
No, Jake, no. Don't
lose control.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.363
Jake. Jake.

05:51.433 --> 05:52.696
Come on, punch them, Jake.

05:52.767 --> 05:54.631
Punch everybody. Why not?

05:54.701 --> 05:56.067
Come on! Why not?

05:56.134 --> 05:58.728
No punchies. I am in control.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.634
Who are you talking to?

06:02.704 --> 06:05.332
Nobody, man! Don't look at me!

06:06.739 --> 06:07.762
Whoa!

06:07.839 --> 06:09.670
Did you guys see that?

06:09.740 --> 06:10.832
Yes. Yeah.

06:10.907 --> 06:13.670
Don't make fun of him.
He's having problems.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.732
Everybody has... aah!

06:15.809 --> 06:18.208
Aaaaah!

06:18.276 --> 06:21.472
Ugh! Stupid ghost dad.

06:21.544 --> 06:23.171
I'll show him.

06:23.244 --> 06:25.178
Ooh. Okay.

06:25.245 --> 06:28.236
Intimidate them with
controlled attack.

06:28.313 --> 06:29.245
Hurry up, guys.

06:29.313 --> 06:31.907
I got to drop a crystal donk.

06:31.981 --> 06:33.811
Oh, come on. I don't
want to hear that.

06:33.881 --> 06:35.158
Hey, whatever, man.
I ain't ashamed.

06:35.182 --> 06:37.013
I got... whoa. What...
what the...

06:37.083 --> 06:39.745
Open up!

06:39.818 --> 06:40.858
Feel my controlled attack.

06:43.151 --> 06:44.914
Whaaaa!

06:44.985 --> 06:45.918
Psssh!

06:45.986 --> 06:47.578
Whaaaa!

06:47.654 --> 06:48.780
Psssh!

06:48.854 --> 06:53.255
Whaaaaaaaa!

06:53.322 --> 06:54.152
Psssh!

06:54.222 --> 06:56.315
Stop it.

06:58.890 --> 07:00.721
I'm not hurting you, am I?

07:00.791 --> 07:03.349
No, you freak.

07:03.425 --> 07:05.950
Well, there's a lot more
where that came from,

07:06.027 --> 07:07.688
so you best tell me

07:07.761 --> 07:10.558
why you're turning
Finn into a crystal.

07:10.628 --> 07:12.152
Or what, you'll touch me?

07:12.229 --> 07:15.493
So help me, I will touch you.

07:15.564 --> 07:17.394
Aah! Jake!

07:17.464 --> 07:18.898
Aah! Help!

07:18.964 --> 07:20.398
Finn, oh, no.

07:20.466 --> 07:22.058
Cut it out. He looks good.

07:22.132 --> 07:24.464
My body!

07:27.067 --> 07:29.160
No! My bud!

07:31.736 --> 07:33.966
Eh, let him in. He
can't do nothing now.

07:36.105 --> 07:37.629
I'm sorry, Finn.

07:37.704 --> 07:39.104
I'm superlame.

07:39.172 --> 07:41.833
And now... you're dead.

07:41.906 --> 07:43.498
I'm not dead.

07:43.574 --> 07:45.474
I'm just all crystal-stiff.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.098
Oh.

07:47.174 --> 07:49.108
Get your hands off my lover.

07:49.175 --> 07:51.473
- That voice.
- It sounds like...

07:51.543 --> 07:55.534
Yes, Finn, it's me, Tree Trunks.

07:55.611 --> 07:58.044
But in this world, I'm known

07:58.112 --> 08:01.205
as Quartzion the crystal queen.

08:01.279 --> 08:03.213
Oh, my grosh. You're alive!

08:03.280 --> 08:06.248
Oh, I'm more than alive, Finn.

08:06.315 --> 08:10.613
After I ate that crystal apple
in the scary dark forest,

08:10.683 --> 08:13.947
I was transported to
this crystal dimension,

08:14.017 --> 08:18.611
where I became ruler
of the crystal men.

08:18.686 --> 08:23.849
And the crystal men are
all in love with me.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.445
- Love you, Quartzion!
- I love you!

08:25.522 --> 08:27.285
- We love you!
- Love you!

08:27.356 --> 08:30.017
Yes, yes, I know.

08:30.090 --> 08:31.682
But your love...

08:32.758 --> 08:34.692
is not enough.

08:34.759 --> 08:35.782
Aah!

08:38.159 --> 08:40.285
I wanted you, Finn,

08:40.360 --> 08:43.193
so you could be transformed

08:43.261 --> 08:46.593
into my sexy crystal king.

08:46.662 --> 08:48.596
Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas

08:48.663 --> 08:50.460
with crystal power.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.465
Finn, it's not sexy for a king

08:52.532 --> 08:55.728
to call his queen bananas.

08:56.233 --> 08:57.860
Aah!

08:57.933 --> 09:00.128
Jake, you've totally
got to stop her.

09:00.201 --> 09:04.135
I'll try, man, but I'm
still figuring out my biz.

09:04.202 --> 09:05.999
Here I come, Tree Trunks.

09:06.070 --> 09:08.129
Taste my gentle rubs.

09:08.204 --> 09:09.136
Whoa there.

09:09.204 --> 09:11.468
Don't you put your
junk on my trunk.

09:11.538 --> 09:12.972
Go, Jake! Go!

09:13.038 --> 09:15.336
She's too sassy and powerful.

09:15.406 --> 09:16.236
Ow!

09:16.306 --> 09:18.797
Jake, Jake, I brought
someone here to see you.

09:18.875 --> 09:19.807
It's your brother.

09:19.875 --> 09:22.105
Jermaine? Are you dead?

09:22.176 --> 09:25.372
No, man, we're just
dreaming at the same time.

09:25.444 --> 09:28.241
Well, I'm sorry about
that time I beat you up.

09:28.311 --> 09:29.573
Yo, that was an accident.

09:29.645 --> 09:31.510
I knew you were
just horsing off.

09:31.579 --> 09:34.137
But, dad, you said I'm
gonna hurt everybody.

09:34.213 --> 09:35.646
Yeah, everybody.

09:35.714 --> 09:38.272
I don't know, dad. That
doesn't really help me.

09:38.348 --> 09:40.907
Everybody who is evil, Jake.

09:40.983 --> 09:43.212
Let me finish next
time, hmm, yeah?

09:43.283 --> 09:45.478
Oh. Well, then I'm over it then.

09:46.885 --> 09:48.944
Jake, kick Tree
Trunks in the tummy.

09:49.018 --> 09:51.646
She's probably still got that
crystal gem apple inside her.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.051
That must be giving
her all her powers.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.849
Marry me, Finn.

09:55.921 --> 09:57.582
We can snuggle through
time and space

10:00.456 --> 10:02.151
and kiss each other

10:02.223 --> 10:05.282
in an alternate
dimensional plane.

10:05.358 --> 10:06.552
Hyah!

10:06.625 --> 10:07.625
Oh!

10:10.393 --> 10:12.758
Oh, dear.

10:12.827 --> 10:14.317
Yeah!

10:15.828 --> 10:17.887
T.T., you're back.

10:17.962 --> 10:21.124
Oh, Jake, I was behaving
so inappropriately.

10:21.197 --> 10:22.960
I'm so embarrassed.

10:23.031 --> 10:25.021
Oh, shush, Tree Trunks.

10:25.098 --> 10:27.396
If I had a penny for every
time someone went crazy,

10:27.466 --> 10:29.831
hopped up on magic energy...

10:30.834 --> 10:32.801
I'd be Abraham Lincoln.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.630
Tree Trunks, you're okay.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.168
Finn!

10:36.235 --> 10:37.668
I'm okay, too!

10:37.736 --> 10:40.330
Oh, Finn, I was trapped
here for so long,

10:40.404 --> 10:42.997
and all I could think about...

10:43.071 --> 10:46.869
was you and how
you're so nice to me.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.669
And I-I just wanted
to say I think...

10:49.741 --> 10:53.573
you're cute, and I like you.

10:53.642 --> 10:55.803
Okay, okay. Let's go.

10:55.876 --> 10:58.309
Finn, when we get home,

10:58.377 --> 11:00.345
it's apple-pie time.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.038
