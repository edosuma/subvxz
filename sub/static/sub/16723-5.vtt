00:22.594 --> 00:24.071
Dad, why are you massaging

00:24.072 --> 00:25.673
the turkey now?

00:25.674 --> 00:27.074
Maybe it's tense.
I'll make it some tea.

00:27.075 --> 00:28.476
I'm doing
a three-day salt rub.

00:28.477 --> 00:29.877
I call it Father
of the Brine. Huh?

00:29.878 --> 00:32.012
Ha!
Thank you.

00:32.014 --> 00:33.748
It's special since
we're having Teddy, Mort...

00:33.749 --> 00:35.316
...and
your Aunt Gayle over.

00:35.317 --> 00:36.684
I don't see why Gayle
and her cats have

00:36.685 --> 00:38.219
to stay with us all week.

00:38.220 --> 00:40.388
She had to vacate her place
because of the fire, Bob.

00:40.389 --> 00:42.089
She put her dental dams
in the dryer.

00:42.090 --> 00:43.491
What are dental dams?

00:43.492 --> 00:44.859
Nothing.
Forget it.

00:44.893 --> 00:46.260
Don't say it at school.

00:46.261 --> 00:47.695
Didn't she used
to only have one cat?

00:47.696 --> 00:49.196
Ah, she adopted one
last week.

00:49.197 --> 00:50.998
And then she found one
on her way over here.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.800
She's a cat magnet.
Oh, it was so sad.

00:52.834 --> 00:54.535
He was just sitting...

00:54.536 --> 00:56.203
on someone's porch,
poor little guy.

00:56.204 --> 00:57.672
Just sittin' there.

00:57.673 --> 00:59.574
Just sitting there in the sun.
Aah.

00:59.575 --> 01:01.042
Ugh.

01:01.043 --> 01:02.410
Ugh, cat hair.

01:02.411 --> 01:04.211
Take one of the allergy
pills I got you!

01:04.212 --> 01:05.846
Well, Dad, I hope
you're not allergic

01:05.847 --> 01:07.615
to melody and rhythm
and sexy lyrics,

01:07.616 --> 01:09.517
'cause our guests are gonna
love my Thanksgiving song!

01:09.518 --> 01:11.185
Ugh.

01:11.219 --> 01:13.187
Every year,
I try and tell you guys

01:13.188 --> 01:15.056
that no one really sings
Thanksgiving songs.

01:15.057 --> 01:16.524
You bite your tongue!
Think about it.

01:16.525 --> 01:18.292
Why aren't there any
Thanksgiving carols?

01:18.293 --> 01:20.728
I'm gonna write a classic
and make a million dollars!

01:20.729 --> 01:22.196
And then I'm
gonna buy a car!

01:22.197 --> 01:23.631
I believe in you, Gene.

01:23.632 --> 01:26.534
I'll be in your...
♪ Song...!

01:26.535 --> 01:28.736
Great, but you don't
get any of the profits,

01:28.737 --> 01:30.404
and I'm going to
be very critical.

01:30.405 --> 01:32.106
Ha! I love it!

01:32.140 --> 01:33.874
Welp, good luck with your song.

01:33.875 --> 01:35.710
And don't be offended
if everyone's talking

01:35.711 --> 01:37.578
about how great my turkey is
while you're trying to sing.

01:37.613 --> 01:39.313
Sounds like someone's
afraid of being upstaged.

01:39.314 --> 01:40.748
You are.

01:40.749 --> 01:42.149
You are.

01:42.150 --> 01:43.651
Oh, God.
Get out of here!

01:43.652 --> 01:46.253
Bob, stop hitting my cats!
And God bless you.

01:46.288 --> 01:48.289
I'm not hitting them!
I'm petting their rear legs.

01:48.290 --> 01:49.724
Mom?
Whoa!

01:49.725 --> 01:51.559
I need your opinion
on something.

01:52.828 --> 01:54.228
Ooh, I love it!

01:54.229 --> 01:55.529
Braveheart meets Coco Chanel!

01:55.564 --> 01:57.231
I need to decide
which color I'm wearing

01:57.232 --> 01:59.100
when I sit at the adults' table
on Thursday.

01:59.101 --> 02:00.468
No, no lipstick,
Tina.

02:00.469 --> 02:01.969
You're-you're
too young.

02:01.970 --> 02:03.404
And you're sitting
at the kids table

02:03.405 --> 02:04.839
like you always do
when we have guests.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.641
Yup, we sit on the floor
at the coffee table

02:06.642 --> 02:08.074
and put our vegetables
under the couch.

02:08.076 --> 02:09.410
You should look
under there.

02:09.443 --> 02:10.811
It's fascinating now!

02:10.846 --> 02:12.613
But I bought pantyhose!

02:12.614 --> 02:14.148
And I've been working
on Tina's talking points.

02:14.149 --> 02:15.516
How's this one?

02:15.517 --> 02:16.984
"In this economy?"

02:17.019 --> 02:18.486
Oh, provocative!
That's it. I...

02:18.487 --> 02:20.354
You know, I'm in charge
of Thanksgiving.

02:20.355 --> 02:22.590
Gene, Linda,
no song.

02:22.591 --> 02:23.190
What?!

02:23.191 --> 02:24.592
Tina,

02:24.593 --> 02:26.127
no adults table.
Aw!

02:26.128 --> 02:27.495
Louise, whatever you're planning,
do not do it.

02:27.496 --> 02:28.929
I need some peace
and quiet.

02:28.930 --> 02:30.264
I want to focus
on the turkey.

02:30.265 --> 02:31.666
Everyone, just
go to bed.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.100
Bob, it's 6:30.

02:33.101 --> 02:34.301
I don't care!
Just go to bed!

02:34.336 --> 02:36.237
You love that turkey more
than you love us!

02:36.271 --> 02:37.805
That's right! I do!

02:37.806 --> 02:38.739
I love turkeys!

02:38.774 --> 02:39.674
Okay.

02:39.675 --> 02:41.275
Now go!

02:54.856 --> 02:57.391
What the...?

02:58.860 --> 03:01.228
Oh, my God! <i>No!</i>

03:01.229 --> 03:03.831
Lin! Lin! What? What happened?
What happened? Wha...?

03:03.832 --> 03:05.566
The turkey...
it's in the toilet!

03:05.567 --> 03:07.902
What are you talkin' about?
You had a bad dream.

03:07.903 --> 03:10.004
Go back to sleep.
This is not a dream. This is happening.

03:10.005 --> 03:11.505
Tina!

03:11.540 --> 03:14.041
There was something in the
toilet, and I sat on it.

03:14.076 --> 03:15.810
It was cold, and now I don't
know if I'll ever be able

03:15.811 --> 03:17.511
to go to the
bathroom again.

03:17.546 --> 03:19.313
Oh, my God,
the turkey's in the toilet!

03:19.314 --> 03:20.681
Get off of there!

03:20.716 --> 03:22.383
What the cuss word?!

03:22.384 --> 03:24.819
Who pooped that, and may
I apprentice with you?

03:24.820 --> 03:26.220
What is this,
a pee-pee party?

03:26.221 --> 03:28.723
You people are fun,
all going at once!

03:28.757 --> 03:32.193
- Oh, God. Oh. Aah! Aah!
- Ugh!

03:32.194 --> 03:33.828
Ugh!
Get it out of their litter box!

03:33.829 --> 03:35.696
Quick, Bob!
They're vegetarians!

03:35.731 --> 03:37.732
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
barf. I'm gonna b...

03:37.733 --> 03:40.428
Oh, my God,
what is happening?!

03:42.797 --> 03:45.165
Okay, so really?
No one is going to confess?

03:45.199 --> 03:45.965
Louise?

03:45.966 --> 03:46.965
It wasn't me!

03:46.967 --> 03:48.368
Louise?

03:48.369 --> 03:49.803
It wasn't!

03:49.804 --> 03:51.237
Fine. So, no one,
including Louise,

03:51.272 --> 03:52.906
wants to admit
that they did this?

03:52.907 --> 03:54.808
I'm giving you guys one more
chance to confess,

03:54.809 --> 03:58.178
and then I'm grounding everyone,
including your mom and Gayle.

03:58.212 --> 03:59.646
Bobby!
No, it's fine with me.

03:59.647 --> 04:01.214
I don't have any plans.

04:01.215 --> 04:03.450
Bobby, it wasn't us.
It was Louise. Come on.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.251
Or, uh, maybe Gene.

04:05.252 --> 04:06.719
How dare you?!

04:06.720 --> 04:09.055
I put food in the toilet
the way God intended.

04:09.056 --> 04:10.557
It had to be Louise.

04:10.558 --> 04:13.460
Unbelievable.
Does everyone think I did it?

04:14.895 --> 04:16.262
Well, then, I
must be guilty.

04:16.262 --> 04:17.664
That's how it
works, right?

04:17.665 --> 04:19.065
Yup. Perfect
system.

04:19.065 --> 04:20.466
Well, I have to go
get another turkey.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.268
Which means I can only do

04:22.269 --> 04:23.770
a two-day brine,

04:23.771 --> 04:25.472
which is not as good
as a three day-brine!

04:25.473 --> 04:27.006
But I'm not forgetting this.

04:27.007 --> 04:28.508
I will figure out who did it.

04:28.509 --> 04:29.943
Even though I'm pretty sure

04:29.944 --> 04:31.311
we all still think
it was Louise.

04:31.345 --> 04:32.979
Make sure you save
room at Thanksgiving

04:32.980 --> 04:34.447
for the words
you'll be eating!

04:34.448 --> 04:36.349
Wait. Are you gonna
throw that one out?

04:36.350 --> 04:37.817
Yes, Gene, it was soaking
in toilet water.

04:37.818 --> 04:39.352
And rolled
in cat feces.

04:39.353 --> 04:41.054
Oh, God, I'm gonna barf again.
No, no, no.

04:41.088 --> 04:42.489
Lin, please!
Oh, my God, I'm gonna barf!

04:42.490 --> 04:43.923
Ugh!

04:43.924 --> 04:45.291
Wait a second.

04:45.292 --> 04:46.693
You just got a
turkey yesterday.

04:46.694 --> 04:48.328
Yup.
Turkey number two, huh?

04:48.329 --> 04:50.330
Messed up the first one?
No, it's a long story.

04:50.364 --> 04:52.599
Not so easy to just step
into the kitchen, is it?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.934
No, actually,
I'm a professional cook.

04:54.935 --> 04:56.302
Yeah. You and
me both, right?

04:56.303 --> 04:57.704
Okay, don't mess
this one up.

04:57.705 --> 04:59.105
I-I didn't...
Next!

04:59.106 --> 05:00.507
I-I didn't mess it up!

05:00.508 --> 05:02.942
Turkey in the toilet?
That's crazy.

05:02.943 --> 05:04.878
It's not that crazy. I've seen
crazier things in a toilet.

05:04.879 --> 05:06.479
You wouldn't believe
what I've seen.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.348
I've seen a rat wearing a little hat.
What?

05:08.382 --> 05:09.849
Twice. Same rat,
different hat.

05:09.850 --> 05:11.351
I got a picture.
Hold on.

05:11.385 --> 05:13.353
Wait. Is this the toilet turkey?
No, I got a new one.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.954
What did you do
with the old one?

05:14.955 --> 05:16.723
What do you mean, what did
I do? I threw it out.

05:16.724 --> 05:18.458
You threw out
a perfectly good turkey?

05:18.459 --> 05:20.627
It wasn't perfectly good, Teddy.
It was in the toilet.

05:20.628 --> 05:22.028
Ugh.
Why does everyone want to eat food

05:22.029 --> 05:23.396
from the toilet
all of a sudden?

05:23.397 --> 05:24.531
Guys, I found
the picture!

05:24.565 --> 05:27.000
Rat in a hat.
Oh, my God. Hmm.

05:27.001 --> 05:28.401
Three days I waited
on a stakeout

05:28.402 --> 05:30.003
for that rat to come back,
and he looks at me...

05:30.004 --> 05:32.171
and he looks at me like,
"What are you lookin' at?"

05:32.172 --> 05:33.540
<i>Come on, Mom,</i>

05:33.574 --> 05:35.008
Gayle, focus!

05:35.009 --> 05:36.376
We've only got two days left

05:36.377 --> 05:37.810
to make a Thanksgiving song

05:37.811 --> 05:39.212
that will be passed down
for generations.

05:39.246 --> 05:40.680
And a one,
and a two.

05:40.681 --> 05:42.382
I don't know
about these lyrics.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.183
What?! Gayle,
you are a guest here.

05:44.184 --> 05:45.685
You will sing
what you are given.

05:45.686 --> 05:47.186
No, Gene,
Gayle's right.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.155
This song's kind of meh.
It needs a little gravy.

05:49.156 --> 05:51.558
That's it!
No one's done a song about gravy.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.393
Think about it.

05:53.394 --> 05:56.162
Hmm. Gravy. Rhymes with wavy,
oopsie daisy, Patrick Swayze.

05:56.163 --> 05:57.564
All right, I'm in!

05:57.565 --> 06:00.400
Anyone mind
if I turn on the news?

06:00.401 --> 06:01.868
Aah! I'm okay.

06:01.869 --> 06:03.236
You fell like a real lady.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.671
Thank you,
young man.

06:04.672 --> 06:06.072
Hello, hi.

06:06.073 --> 06:07.440
Hi.
Hi, Gayle. You look great.

06:07.441 --> 06:08.741
Louise,
look at you.

06:08.742 --> 06:10.176
Did you do your hair?
No.

06:10.177 --> 06:11.578
Love it.
Gene. Hi.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.012
What a nice shirt
you're wearing.

06:13.013 --> 06:14.781
Thank you.
Excellent.

06:14.782 --> 06:16.416
I just want to say
that I've calmed down

06:16.450 --> 06:19.218
from this morning, and
in the spirit of the holidays,

06:19.219 --> 06:23.489
whoever did this,
I am granting you a full pardon.

06:23.524 --> 06:25.391
Oh, I really thought
that would work.

06:25.392 --> 06:28.027
Seriously, who put the
turkey in the toilet?!

06:28.028 --> 06:31.064
Oh, Dad. If I may.

06:31.065 --> 06:33.399
I've taken the liberty of
drawing up a little chart here.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.635
Let's review our suspects.

06:35.636 --> 06:39.372
Tina. She'd stop at nothing
for some grownup stuffing.

06:39.373 --> 06:42.108
Did her table envy drive her
over the edge?

06:42.109 --> 06:42.775
No.

06:42.776 --> 06:43.576
Gene.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.211
He thinks

06:45.212 --> 06:46.779
there's only room
for one bird at this table.

06:46.780 --> 06:48.247
A song bird.

06:48.248 --> 06:50.049
Do-re-me?!

06:50.050 --> 06:52.051
Or was it Gayle?

06:52.052 --> 06:54.220
Dad went after her cats,
she went after his turkey.

06:54.221 --> 06:55.922
Classic revenge tale.

06:55.923 --> 06:57.123
Classic.

06:57.124 --> 06:58.458
Or maybe, maybe Linda.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.827
Oh, sweet Linda.

07:00.828 --> 07:03.529
A long-suffering wife stuck
in a bad marriage.

07:03.564 --> 07:05.131
Aw, poor thing!
Lin!

07:05.132 --> 07:07.400
What? I got caught up in
the story. She's good.

07:07.434 --> 07:08.968
And that leaves Louise,

07:08.969 --> 07:10.069
who had no motive at all.
Thank you. The end.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.571
Thank you.

07:11.572 --> 07:13.973
What an imagination
on this one, huh? Kids. Mmm.

07:13.974 --> 07:15.408
So, do you know
who did it?

07:15.442 --> 07:16.809
Oh. No. Uh-uh.

07:16.810 --> 07:18.244
Then what's the point
of all this?

07:18.278 --> 07:20.446
Hold on. I just had an idea.

07:20.447 --> 07:21.814
Was it you, Gayle?!
Huh? Confess!

07:21.815 --> 07:23.583
Damn it, Gayle!

07:23.584 --> 07:26.319
Or you?! Confess!
You're guilty as hell!

07:26.353 --> 07:27.820
Louise?
What? Stop.

07:27.821 --> 07:29.489
Why?
This isn't working.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.858
I guess I'll just never trust
any of you again,

07:31.859 --> 07:33.626
forever, for as long as I live.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.495
Another great family meeting!
Good night, everyone!

07:35.496 --> 07:36.963
Good night!
Good night, Bob!

07:36.964 --> 07:38.531
Night, night!
Good night, Dad!

07:38.532 --> 07:40.366
Do you want my charts to take
into your room for review?

07:40.367 --> 07:42.001
No. Just go to bed then.

08:00.454 --> 08:03.156
No!

08:03.157 --> 08:04.691
Okay, fun's over!

08:04.692 --> 08:05.625
I want a name!

08:05.626 --> 08:07.060
Gene!
Oh, come on!

08:07.061 --> 08:08.861
You know I don't go
into the bathroom at night

08:08.862 --> 08:10.997
because of
the shower ghost.

08:10.998 --> 08:12.331
Ah, that's him!

08:12.332 --> 08:13.666
It's got to be Tina!

08:13.667 --> 08:15.868
Tina wouldn't do something
this immature.

08:15.903 --> 08:18.404
I accept your invitation to sit
at the adults' table.

08:18.405 --> 08:19.205
No, Tina.

08:19.206 --> 08:22.375
Maybe it was me!
Was it?

08:22.409 --> 08:24.377
No. I just started
to feel left out.

08:24.411 --> 08:27.313
I don't know, Gayle.
You are really... weird.

08:27.347 --> 08:28.815
That's true.

08:28.816 --> 08:30.216
Come on,
it wasn't Gayle.

08:30.217 --> 08:31.584
Is that a confession, Mom?

08:31.585 --> 08:33.419
What? That's crazy.

08:33.419 --> 08:36.155
Well, you aren't always the most
trustworthy person, Linda.

08:36.155 --> 08:38.224
What!? Me!?
Yes, you.

08:38.225 --> 08:39.859
That time you
changed the channel

08:39.860 --> 08:41.327
when I was out
of the room.

08:41.328 --> 08:42.528
What are you talking about?

08:42.529 --> 08:44.363
Oh, don't play innocent!

08:44.364 --> 08:46.566
It was <i>Quantum Leap,</i> and
I'll never know where he leapt!

08:46.567 --> 08:48.401
You know where he leapt.

08:48.435 --> 08:49.902
Flush!
Gene, stop!

08:49.903 --> 08:51.437
We need to get rid
of the body!

08:51.438 --> 08:53.172
What if someone sees?
Stop.

08:53.173 --> 08:55.241
Oh.

08:55.242 --> 08:58.778
Hi, uh, I need
two turkeys, please.

08:58.779 --> 09:01.180
Oh. You again.
Uh... yeah.

09:01.181 --> 09:03.850
Look, I think I know what's
going on here and, uh...

09:03.851 --> 09:05.585
I'm flattered, but
I'm in a relationship.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.654
What? Oh, no, no.
I'm not trying to... Hey, hey.

09:08.689 --> 09:10.790
Listen, Daddy, don't you
let one rejection keep you

09:10.791 --> 09:12.492
from getting out
there. You seem great.

09:12.526 --> 09:14.193
Okay, thanks.

09:14.194 --> 09:15.528
There's a whole group
of guys out there

09:15.529 --> 09:17.029
who don't care about
what guys look like.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.731
Uh... could I just
get my turkey, please?

09:18.732 --> 09:20.500
You know, I got a friend...
he's into Sloppy Bears.

09:20.534 --> 09:22.368
Wha-What's a Sloppy Bear?

09:22.369 --> 09:24.637
You know, you got the muffin
top, you got food on your shirt.

09:24.638 --> 09:27.106
God, I... I do. Let me set you up.
I'll tell you what.

09:27.141 --> 09:28.775
I'm gonna write down their
number on the receipt.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.209
You take it, and
you do what you want.

09:30.210 --> 09:31.577
No, no, no, I think
you have the wrong idea.

09:31.578 --> 09:33.045
I'm not interested
in a gay... yeah.

09:33.046 --> 09:34.914
Uh-huh, I know, you're
not interested.

09:34.915 --> 09:36.382
In a relationship.
That's cool. Here's the number.

09:36.383 --> 09:38.417
I'll talk to you later.
Get out of here!

09:39.653 --> 09:41.387
Bob! Who is it?

09:41.421 --> 09:42.288
It's me. Open up.

09:42.289 --> 09:43.656
Uh-uh.
Come on!

09:43.657 --> 09:45.091
No! Come on! No.

09:45.092 --> 09:46.459
I need to get
into the bedroom.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.161
My armpits need
a second coat of deodorant.

09:48.162 --> 09:49.762
I need to re-odorize.
I stink!

09:49.763 --> 09:51.898
Ugh. I don't know.

09:51.899 --> 09:53.299
Bobby, you're being crazy.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.634
Uh... fine,
but close your eyes.

09:54.668 --> 09:56.169
Bobby, what are you doing?

09:56.170 --> 09:57.670
Hey, I said, eyes closed.

09:57.671 --> 10:00.339
You know my eyes
don't completely close.

10:00.340 --> 10:02.475
I'm sorry,
but I can't trust anyone.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.911
Oh, Bob, what's with
the two turkeys?

10:04.912 --> 10:06.345
Nothing!
Hey! You calm down!

10:06.346 --> 10:07.914
Now, come on, stop it.

10:07.915 --> 10:09.949
Okay, I'll tell you,
but you can't tell anyone.

10:09.950 --> 10:11.751
Oh, I won't!
Who would I tell?

10:11.752 --> 10:13.419
Come on, it's me!

10:13.420 --> 10:16.422
Okay, one's a decoy turkey
for the upstairs fridge.

10:16.423 --> 10:19.525
The real turkey will be
downstairs in the walk-in.

10:19.526 --> 10:21.427
Ha, <i>ha!</i>
Bobby...

10:21.428 --> 10:22.962
It's a good plan, right?

10:22.963 --> 10:24.797
Yeah. Yeah, I thought of it.

10:24.798 --> 10:27.033
You, my smart guy.
Sometimes.

10:27.034 --> 10:29.702
Devious little turkey
roaster in the bedroom.

10:29.703 --> 10:31.671
Well, well, maybe a little bit.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.573
You want to mess around?

10:33.607 --> 10:37.343
What? I don't know, all these
turkeys... it makes me horny.

10:37.344 --> 10:39.412
Well, not, not right now,
Lin, no.

10:39.446 --> 10:40.847
You sure?

10:40.848 --> 10:41.848
Okay, maybe a little.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.049
That's my boy.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.352
Ooh, ooh, I really
do need deodorant.

10:46.353 --> 10:47.820
Yeah, you really do.
Whew, I stink.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.956
Wow.
Put your face in it.

10:49.957 --> 10:51.891
No, I don't want... Come on, put
your face in it, put your face in it.

10:51.892 --> 10:53.626
I don't... no, I don't want to
go there. Put your face in it.

10:53.627 --> 10:55.147
It's coming at you.
All right, get out.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.561
Oh, no, Dad.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.330
No, no, no, no, no,
I fell asleep.

11:31.331 --> 11:32.531
Sorry for your loss.

11:32.532 --> 11:34.367
No, Tina, I'm sorry

11:34.368 --> 11:37.003
for whoever thought
they could ruin Thanksgiving.

11:37.004 --> 11:38.905
Follow me to the walk-in.

11:38.939 --> 11:42.341
What?!
No!

11:44.611 --> 11:46.279
A turkey in every toilet.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.780
Only in America,
huh, guys?

11:48.701 --> 11:51.646
It was you, Lin, it's
been you all along.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.255
Say it.
No, Bobby, no, it wasn't me.

11:54.283 --> 11:56.284
You were the only one who knew
about the second turkey.

11:56.285 --> 11:57.318
It had to be you.

11:57.352 --> 11:58.686
I knew
about the second turkey.

11:58.720 --> 11:59.719
What?
Lin!

11:59.721 --> 12:01.455
You know I tell
Gayle everything, Bobby.

12:01.456 --> 12:02.590
She's my sister.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.292
It's true,
I know everything,

12:04.293 --> 12:07.128
like that time you peed in the
theater during <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

12:07.129 --> 12:08.529
I didn't want to
miss any of it!

12:08.564 --> 12:10.097
Mom told me, too.

12:10.098 --> 12:12.500
About peeing during
<i>Jerry Maguire</i> or the turkey?

12:12.534 --> 12:13.768
Both.
Mom and I shop together.

12:13.769 --> 12:15.236
We don't have any secrets.

12:15.270 --> 12:16.771
So all three of you knew?

12:16.805 --> 12:18.706
Louise and I knew, too.
Mom's like a vault

12:18.707 --> 12:21.209
that's constantly open
and constantly talking.

12:21.243 --> 12:24.111
Hey, I told you guys not
to tell anyone I told you.

12:24.112 --> 12:26.380
Okay, Thanksgiving
is officially canceled.

12:26.415 --> 12:28.382
For everyone
or just for our family?

12:28.417 --> 12:29.750
Bob...
No, Lin, I've had it.

12:29.751 --> 12:31.619
Thanksgiving's ruined.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.088
There's no time to do the Father
of the Brine on a new turkey,

12:34.089 --> 12:36.224
plus I'm way
over the Thanksgiving budget.

12:36.225 --> 12:37.992
This is the worst
Thanksgiving ever.

12:37.993 --> 12:39.293
Okay, calm down.

12:39.294 --> 12:40.561
No, I will not calm down!

12:41.897 --> 12:43.431
Hey, let's all forget
about Thanksgiving

12:43.432 --> 12:44.599
and move on
to Christmas.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.900
I'll go get
the decorations.

12:45.901 --> 12:47.802
No, you know what?
I take it back.

12:47.803 --> 12:50.438
I'm not canceling
Thanksgiving. Yay.

12:50.439 --> 12:52.673
Whoever's doing this,
I'm not going to let you win!

12:52.674 --> 12:54.275
Thanksgiving is back on!

12:54.309 --> 12:57.545
There will be a turkey,
a stupid saltless turkey.

12:57.579 --> 12:59.914
You can put
a turkey in a toilet,

12:59.915 --> 13:02.049
but you can't put me
in a toilet!

13:02.084 --> 13:03.317
It kind of sounds
like you want us

13:03.318 --> 13:05.386
to try to put you in a toilet.

13:05.420 --> 13:08.055
No, Louise, I don't want
to be put in a toilet.

13:08.090 --> 13:09.457
Okay, but it sounded like that.

13:09.458 --> 13:10.825
It did sound
like that, Bob.

13:10.859 --> 13:12.493
Let's try... one, two, three.

13:13.829 --> 13:15.429
Hey, you again, huh?

13:15.430 --> 13:17.265
Oh, hey, you again

13:17.299 --> 13:18.599
and me, yep.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.635
I-I just, uh,
I came for a, uh...

13:20.669 --> 13:22.303
I suppose you want
another "turkey."

13:22.337 --> 13:23.971
Yes, that's exactly
what I want... a turkey.

13:23.972 --> 13:25.172
I didn't come for anything el...

13:25.173 --> 13:27.808
Okay, fine, you
wore me down.

13:27.843 --> 13:29.010
Damn it.
Uh...

13:29.011 --> 13:30.711
Things are not going
great with Tony.

13:30.712 --> 13:32.647
Haven't been great with Tony
for a long time, you know?

13:32.648 --> 13:34.689
Tony's hot, but maybe it's
time for me to just settle.

13:34.716 --> 13:36.017
Look... uh, no, no, no.

13:36.018 --> 13:37.518
Look at me, I'm nothing.

13:37.519 --> 13:39.287
You, you love Tony,
stay with Tony.

13:39.321 --> 13:42.123
I'm so sick of Tony
and his dancing.

13:42.157 --> 13:45.293
Oh, no, I d... I don't know Tony,
but I-I assume it's great.

13:45.327 --> 13:46.961
It's not great with Tony. You
should definitely stay with Tony.

13:46.962 --> 13:48.095
No, no, no.
Yo, I'm taking my break!

13:48.130 --> 13:49.370
Oh, my God, we're doing this.

13:49.398 --> 13:51.232
No, we're not.
Hey, what do you want to do?

13:51.233 --> 13:52.800
I don't... nothing.
You want to go to the beach, huh?

13:52.801 --> 13:53.868
No, maybe...
wait, I'm straight.

13:53.869 --> 13:55.236
I mean,
I'm mostly straight.

13:55.237 --> 13:56.404
Let's grab a coffee.
You should call Tony.

13:56.405 --> 13:57.605
No, let's just have sex!

13:57.639 --> 13:58.973
Ah, God, this
feels so great!

13:58.974 --> 14:01.008
I should just... sorry,
I got to go cook this.

14:01.009 --> 14:03.077
Also I'm married,
but if I wasn't...

14:03.078 --> 14:04.478
Who am I kidding?
You're out of my league.

14:04.479 --> 14:06.013
It would never work.

14:06.048 --> 14:07.581
What are you talking about?
I really got to go.

14:07.582 --> 14:09.884
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
Probably not.

14:09.885 --> 14:10.892
I'll call you.

14:19.161 --> 14:21.662
It's almost too obvious.

14:21.663 --> 14:23.597
The table looks
beautiful, Linda.

14:23.598 --> 14:25.366
Whoa, candles shaped
like little pilgrims.

14:25.367 --> 14:26.701
Those can't be cheap.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.436
Yes, Linda, what
a lovely spread.

14:28.437 --> 14:30.171
Oh, interesting, Teddy,
looks like you're over here.

14:30.205 --> 14:32.413
Okay, where am I?
Tina,

14:32.441 --> 14:35.109
Teddy isn't sitting at the
kids' table, honey, no.

14:35.110 --> 14:36.577
It's okay, Lin,
it'll be like I'm eating

14:36.578 --> 14:37.578
at a Japanese restaurant.

14:37.579 --> 14:39.080
I'll take my shoes off.

14:39.081 --> 14:40.581
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

14:40.615 --> 14:43.050
Ha, I did it, I did it!

14:43.085 --> 14:44.185
What, Bob, what did you do?

14:44.186 --> 14:46.120
I cooked a turkey!

14:46.121 --> 14:47.588
Oh, wow.

14:47.589 --> 14:49.256
This guy's always
fishing for compliments.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.524
Turkey's done.

14:50.525 --> 14:52.767
Okay, everyone sit...
Tina, not you.

14:52.794 --> 14:56.270
You thought you could stop me,
but you can't.

14:56.298 --> 14:58.399
Oh, hello,
everybody.

14:58.433 --> 15:01.268
One of you must be
very unhappy to see this.

15:01.269 --> 15:02.870
Bob, you look terrible.

15:02.871 --> 15:05.740
Yeah, because I was
up all night trying to stop

15:05.741 --> 15:07.281
a turkey murderer.

15:08.243 --> 15:09.577
Okay, before I serve
the turkey...

15:09.578 --> 15:11.045
Wait, Tina, what are you doing?

15:11.046 --> 15:12.480
I'm standing
at the adults' table?

15:12.481 --> 15:14.281
Tina, go sit down
at the kids' table.

15:14.282 --> 15:16.617
Fine, I'll go check in
on the little ones.

15:16.618 --> 15:17.618
I'm great with them.

15:17.619 --> 15:19.387
So, as I was saying,

15:19.388 --> 15:21.956
to the terrorist who tried
to stop me from serving this,

15:21.957 --> 15:24.625
I want it on the record that
turkey was served on this day!

15:26.428 --> 15:31.132
But, but, before we do that,
I need to serve some justice

15:31.133 --> 15:34.101
because I know who put
the turkey in the toilet.

15:34.102 --> 15:36.137
♪ Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!

15:36.171 --> 15:38.539
Oh, my God, she's got it,
she's got it. Peas and carrots...

15:38.573 --> 15:41.208
At first I wondered, who
could be mad enough at Dad

15:41.243 --> 15:42.476
to do such a thing?

15:42.477 --> 15:44.111
I mean, sure, no one likes him.

15:44.146 --> 15:45.780
Louise.
And he smells.

15:45.781 --> 15:48.315
But then I realized that I was
looking at the wrong motive.

15:48.316 --> 15:50.251
The person who put
the turkeys in the toilet

15:50.252 --> 15:53.254
was actually angry at me!

15:53.255 --> 15:55.329
Oh, my God.
What are we doing?

15:55.357 --> 15:57.691
You see, this person knew
that I would be blamed

15:57.692 --> 16:00.761
and potentially punished
for this heinous crime.

16:00.762 --> 16:02.096
So, was it Mom?

16:02.097 --> 16:03.264
Don't think so.

16:03.265 --> 16:04.598
Correct, it was not.

16:04.599 --> 16:05.766
Was it Gayle?

16:05.801 --> 16:07.234
I don't know.

16:07.269 --> 16:08.302
No, it wasn't.
Oh.

16:08.303 --> 16:09.403
Which brings us
to Gene

16:09.438 --> 16:11.238
and Tina.
At first

16:11.273 --> 16:12.973
I actually believed
that Gene was too scared

16:12.974 --> 16:15.309
of the shower ghost to go
into the bathroom at night,

16:15.310 --> 16:17.111
and I believed Dad's theory

16:17.112 --> 16:19.313
that Tina was too mature
to do something like this.

16:19.314 --> 16:21.315
If she was acting alone.

16:21.316 --> 16:22.783
But what if...

16:23.718 --> 16:25.286
...they were
working together?!

16:25.320 --> 16:26.487
I knew it.
I can see it.

16:26.488 --> 16:28.456
That one's got
crazy eyes.

16:28.490 --> 16:30.257
<i>Gene taking the turkey
out of the refrigerator</i>

16:30.292 --> 16:33.761
<i>each night and passing it</i>
<i>to Tina, who dropped it in.</i>

16:33.795 --> 16:36.297
Yes! They worked
together to frame me

16:36.298 --> 16:38.799
because I have been slowly
stealing their allowances

16:38.800 --> 16:40.034
over the last
five years.

16:40.035 --> 16:41.402
Wait, you have?
You have?

16:41.403 --> 16:43.537
Yes... wait, you guys
didn't know that?

16:43.538 --> 16:45.806
No. No.
Oh, never mind 'cause I haven't been.

16:45.807 --> 16:47.508
Oh, good.

16:47.509 --> 16:51.579
Okay, uh, and now, before
we eat... wait, no one eat...

16:51.580 --> 16:53.180
we... Teddy, drop it!

16:53.181 --> 16:56.817
We would like to present
our Thanksgiving song.

16:56.852 --> 16:58.185
No, Lin, it's time
to cut the tur...

16:58.186 --> 16:59.353
Yay, all right.

16:59.354 --> 17:00.728
Get over here, Gene,
hit it, come on.

17:00.755 --> 17:02.490

Bob, come back.

17:26.414 --> 17:27.414
What are you...?
Dad?

17:27.449 --> 17:28.816
He's taking
the turkey.

17:28.850 --> 17:30.551
Huh, is this part
of the show?

17:30.552 --> 17:32.620
Are we supposed to grab something?
No, no, no.

17:32.621 --> 17:34.021
I'm getting the potatoes.
Wait for me, Bobby. No, n-n-n-no.

17:34.055 --> 17:35.456
Wait for me, Bobby.
Aah!

17:37.610 --> 17:39.077
What the...?

17:39.078 --> 17:40.445
Dad's a sleepwalker?

17:40.446 --> 17:42.113
Not normally.
Should we wake him?

17:42.114 --> 17:44.082
Never wake a sleepwalker;
They could get violent.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.950
And whatever you do,
don't give him an ax.

17:45.951 --> 17:47.952
What, an ax? Why would
we give him an ax?

17:47.987 --> 17:50.021
Don't!
Let's give him an ax!

17:50.055 --> 17:52.690
Okay, Tina, do you have
to go pee-pee or poo-poo?

17:52.725 --> 17:54.726
Oh, my God, he thinks
the turkey's Tina.

17:54.727 --> 17:56.161
Why does Dad think I'm a turkey?

17:56.162 --> 17:57.262
Your cocky strut.

17:57.263 --> 17:59.230
I don't know, unless...

17:59.231 --> 18:03.435
He must be remembering
toilet-training you.

18:03.436 --> 18:05.069
Potty.
Yeah, there it is...

18:05.070 --> 18:06.738
Tina's poo-poo potty.

18:06.739 --> 18:08.754
All right, who's
a big girl?

18:10.075 --> 18:11.810
He potty-trained
all you kids.

18:11.811 --> 18:13.011
I couldn't stomach it.

18:13.012 --> 18:14.345
The stinky babies.

18:14.346 --> 18:15.480
Just the
thought of it.

18:15.481 --> 18:17.182
My dad toilet-trained me.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.918
It was the worst seven years
of my life... seven to 14.

18:19.919 --> 18:22.320
I like to think <i>I</i>
trained the toilet.

18:22.321 --> 18:23.888
It didn't teach
me anything.

18:23.923 --> 18:25.457
Oh, stinky.

18:25.491 --> 18:27.492
Oh, it's kind
of sweet.

18:27.493 --> 18:28.927
Oh, my God, there
goes the stuffing.

18:28.928 --> 18:30.495
Oh, God, oh, God.

18:30.529 --> 18:32.363
Wow, Tina, you really had to go.

18:32.364 --> 18:34.098
Aah, we're losing stuffing!

18:34.133 --> 18:35.600
Oh, it's nice.

18:35.601 --> 18:37.635
You have to stop him
before he drops the turkey in.

18:37.670 --> 18:39.304
Okay. Aah!
No, don't wake him.

18:39.305 --> 18:41.406
Aah!
Ow, what-what's going on?

18:41.440 --> 18:44.075
No! Hold his arms and legs
so he can't attack.

18:44.109 --> 18:46.911
Give me some help here!
Ah, Dad, if you're still asleep,

18:46.946 --> 18:49.147
can I borrow a hundred bucks?
Can I get a neck tattoo?

18:49.181 --> 18:51.316
Let go of me!
It's for your own good!

18:51.350 --> 18:52.517
Aah!

18:52.518 --> 18:53.518
What's happening?

18:53.519 --> 18:54.619
Who's fighting me?

18:54.620 --> 18:55.954
It's your friend!

18:55.988 --> 18:57.489
No, no, no, no, no,

18:57.523 --> 18:58.623
bad kitties.

18:58.624 --> 19:00.124
It's the end of the world!

19:00.125 --> 19:02.327
Go on,
get, get, go!

19:02.328 --> 19:03.728
It's for your
own good, Bobby!

19:03.729 --> 19:05.029
Aah, let go!

19:05.030 --> 19:08.132
Finally something
to be thankful for!

19:08.133 --> 19:10.168
It was the allergy pills.

19:10.202 --> 19:11.736
Says right here.

19:11.737 --> 19:13.638
"Side effects include
sleepwalking, sleep talking,

19:13.639 --> 19:15.139
"night terrors,
and dry mouth.

19:15.174 --> 19:16.741
"Contact your doctor
if you lose vision

19:16.742 --> 19:17.876
or if your heart stops beating."

19:17.877 --> 19:19.310
Huh.
That doesn't explain

19:19.311 --> 19:21.379
why Dad kept dreaming
about toilet-training me.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.581
Yeah, the same dream
over and over.

19:23.582 --> 19:24.883
It's got to mean something,

19:24.884 --> 19:26.417
like the time I dreamt
about a dolphin

19:26.418 --> 19:28.119
and I woke up
and my bed was on fire.

19:28.153 --> 19:29.554
What did that
dream mean?

19:29.555 --> 19:31.055
Just that I didn't have
balance in my life...

19:31.056 --> 19:32.557
I was spending
too much time at work.

19:32.558 --> 19:34.592
Also, I shouldn't leave
matches right by my bed.

19:34.593 --> 19:36.060
I had just gone
to the aquarium;

19:36.061 --> 19:37.495
It probably had something
to do with that.

19:37.530 --> 19:39.764
Oh, my God, Bobby,
don't you see?

19:39.765 --> 19:42.166
You were worried
about Tina growing up

19:42.167 --> 19:44.536
'cause she wanted to sit
at the adults' table.

19:44.537 --> 19:45.570
You see how it works?

19:45.604 --> 19:47.272
Ooh, Dad loves Tina.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.073
I knew it.

19:49.108 --> 19:51.276
It's okay, Dad, even if I sit
at the adults' table,

19:51.277 --> 19:53.111
I'll still be your little girl.
Just because I've got the hang

19:53.112 --> 19:54.946
of pooping and peeing
in the potty

19:54.947 --> 19:56.781
doesn't mean I don't need your
help with other things,

19:56.782 --> 19:57.882
like homework or faxing.

19:57.883 --> 19:59.217
I don't know
how to fax.

19:59.218 --> 20:00.919
Mom, can you help me fax
something right now?

20:00.953 --> 20:03.187
It's okay, Tina, I know
you've got to grow up sometime.

20:03.188 --> 20:05.557
Just maybe no lipstick yet.

20:05.591 --> 20:07.225
Okay.
And no panty hose.

20:07.226 --> 20:09.327
I don't think anyone still wears
those, right?

20:09.361 --> 20:10.543
Not in this economy.

20:10.563 --> 20:12.630
Tina. Aw, I love my little family.

20:12.631 --> 20:14.098
Come here, family
hug, come here, aw.

20:14.099 --> 20:15.433
You, too, Gayle.
That's nice.

20:15.434 --> 20:16.901
Come on, come on,
yeah, here we go.

20:16.902 --> 20:18.703
Hey, Teddy, Mort, come
on, what are you doing?

20:18.704 --> 20:20.738
Come over here. I can see from here.
What the hell?

20:22.741 --> 20:24.943
Ow, Teddy, why are
you hugging so hard?

20:24.944 --> 20:26.210
Because I'm full
of love, Bob.

20:26.211 --> 20:27.579
Hug.

20:30.449 --> 20:33.151
Okay, Gene, time to go poo-poo.
