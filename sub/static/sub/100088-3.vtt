09:24.172 --> 09:25.869
[door opens]

09:25.913 --> 09:27.392
You wanted to see me, sir?

09:27.436 --> 09:30.004
Have a seat, Spenser.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.658
[door closes]

09:35.139 --> 09:38.142
You were friends
with Brett Swann.

09:38.186 --> 09:41.232
Yes, towards the, uh,
the end of his life.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.973
Well, he was a fine Frogman

09:43.017 --> 09:45.106
and what happened to him
was a tragedy.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.239
Not so sure about that.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.285
Swann's suicide
was predictable

09:50.328 --> 09:54.419
and likely avoidable,
and tragedies aren't, sir.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.683
Well, what you've been doing
to promote the awareness

09:56.726 --> 09:58.685
of TBIs is commendable.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.643
When you were injured,
you didn't stop working
for your friends.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.905
You made Swann your mission,

10:01.949 --> 10:03.820
even when the Navy
waved you off.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.213
Sir, I haven't done anything...

10:05.256 --> 10:07.258
Spenser, relax.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.825
I'm on your side.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.872
[helicopter blades whirring
outside]

10:14.091 --> 10:16.659
Forgive me, sir, but, uh,

10:16.703 --> 10:20.794
sailors don't usually reach your
position by rocking the boat.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.318
Eh, that's spoken
like an outsider looking in,

10:23.361 --> 10:26.626
'cause I have found
that it is much easier

10:26.669 --> 10:29.150
to rock from the inside.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.676
Which is why
I'm bringing in a physiologist

10:33.720 --> 10:36.157
to work with the team,
assess what we do here

10:36.200 --> 10:37.854
and how we can better
take care of our people.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.901
This is what we need.
This woman is smart.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.904
She has new ideas, and she's
made a career for herself

10:43.947 --> 10:46.820
studying special operators.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.212
21st century warriors.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.737
They deserve
21st century treatment.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.132
Your outlook is
refreshing, sir.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.525
Well, I'm committed,
and the Navy's committed

10:56.568 --> 10:59.702
to making sure we don't have
another Brett Swann.

10:59.746 --> 11:02.531
And in return, I need you
to stand down

11:02.574 --> 11:05.621
and just go back to
concentrating on your job.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.451
'Cause what you
and your father are doing

11:09.494 --> 11:11.192
could have unintended
consequences

11:11.235 --> 11:12.410
that could jeopardize
the good things

11:12.454 --> 11:14.151
we're putting into place.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.719
And that would only
make my job harder.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.591
Yes, sir.

11:23.378 --> 11:26.686
And, Spenser,
just to be clear,

11:26.729 --> 11:28.992
I'm not asking.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.602
Understand?
Yes, sir.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.054
Mm, look at this one.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.360
That's beautiful, babe.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.797
And way out of our
price range.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.407
Then why are you
looking at it?

11:52.450 --> 11:55.671
Uh, same reason you always check
out the Denali at the car lot.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.368
Naima, one day I'm
getting a damn Denali.

11:57.412 --> 12:00.502
And one day I'll get
this house, or one like it.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.286
I mean, it's in a great
school district.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.636
Kids would have
their own rooms.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.203
Save us from having to hear
a lot of fights

12:06.247 --> 12:07.857
in the next few years.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.729
Babe, you know I would love
nothing more in the world

12:09.772 --> 12:10.904
than to get you that home.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.601
Really. I just...

12:12.644 --> 12:14.211
Someday,
but not right now.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.735
I mean, even once you make
master chief,

12:15.778 --> 12:17.345
it'll still be out
of our price range.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.695
I don't know.
I don't know.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.784
Maybe we, uh...
maybe we stretch.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.787
You know?
Take a leap of faith.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.267
It is perfect, isn't it?

12:26.310 --> 12:30.184
It is, but that
doesn't matter.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.620
No?
No.

12:31.663 --> 12:34.579
The only thing that does is
you coming home to it.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.933
It's all happening,
our plan.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.412
You're gonna make
master chief.

12:41.456 --> 12:44.328
And you are gonna
make CNO at work.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.635
Mm.
Yeah.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.942
The dreams are
coming true, huh, babe?Mm.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.774
EMMA:
Where do you want
the glasses?

12:54.817 --> 12:56.340
To the right of the
sink, or the left?

12:56.384 --> 12:58.995
I don't care.
[sighs]

12:59.039 --> 13:01.041
Coffee maker?

13:01.084 --> 13:02.390
Left side of the sink,
near the glasses?

13:02.433 --> 13:04.000
I don't know, tell you what.
Why don't you choose?

13:04.044 --> 13:05.828
Just put it wherever.No, you choose.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.656
This is your life now, Dad.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.267
Time for you to start
turning this cave into a home.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.530
A home?

13:15.490 --> 13:17.231
DAVIS:
Sonny, you know, this is
a really nice idea,

13:17.274 --> 13:21.278
but you shouldn't be spending
this kind of money.

13:21.322 --> 13:25.065
Well, to tell you
the truth, uh,

13:25.108 --> 13:26.675
I ain't ever done
anything like this

13:26.718 --> 13:28.764
for anyone before.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.725
You know, it's kinda, kinda nice
getting all gussied up.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.031
[laughs]

13:35.075 --> 13:36.511
I even Febrezed
my shirt for you.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.556
Oh, my. [chuckles]Yeah. Blueberry.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.341
[both laugh]

13:40.384 --> 13:42.560
It's like a fancy
first date.
Mm-hmm.

13:42.604 --> 13:45.041
Except this first date
is a sure thing.

13:45.085 --> 13:49.132
[laughs]Sonny, you're stupid.

13:49.176 --> 13:51.482
So should we, um...
[clears throat]

13:51.526 --> 13:54.529
I don't know...

13:54.572 --> 13:56.487
go over to that hotel
and check out

13:56.531 --> 13:59.316
that swanky suite
you were telling me about?

13:59.360 --> 14:00.752
Uh, well,

14:00.796 --> 14:03.494
"swanky" might have
undersold it.

14:03.538 --> 14:08.021
This hotel would make
an old man very proud.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.327
It's got a Jacuzzi,
a fireplace.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.155
If there's carpet anywhere
other than the floor,

14:12.199 --> 14:13.853
I'm leaving.
[chuckles]

14:13.896 --> 14:17.204
I would be disappointed
if you didn't.
[chuckles]

14:17.247 --> 14:19.684
[phone chimes]

14:22.731 --> 14:24.907
Oh, we got a new
target package coming in.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.648
I didn't get paged.

14:26.691 --> 14:30.521
It's intel, Sonny.
We get read in before the team.

14:33.481 --> 14:36.179
I gotta go back.
I'm sorry.
All right.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.529
Hey, it's all right.
No sweat.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.009
Don't be sorry.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.533
These things happen. Right?

14:57.113 --> 14:58.680
[trilling]

15:00.987 --> 15:03.511
Global Response Staff are
keeping us posted,

15:03.554 --> 15:06.166
but the situation on the ground
is volatile and fluid.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.472
As everyone in this room
is aware,

15:08.516 --> 15:10.735
in addition to possible
violence and loss of life,

15:10.779 --> 15:14.348
there is a significant political
component to the situation.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.958
Sovereign governments
in the region

15:16.002 --> 15:18.961
and around the globe
will be watching closely.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.094
You realize instead
of fixing that,

15:21.137 --> 15:23.313
you could get Pandora
on your computer.

15:23.357 --> 15:25.098
Or Sirius.

15:25.141 --> 15:28.492
Satellite radio.This one works just fine, Em.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.973
Who put the sunrise
on my mug?

15:31.017 --> 15:32.932
New day, warm colors.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.803
Doesn't it make you happy?Not really.

15:34.846 --> 15:37.197
Are you joking?
What?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.938
That's filthy.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.026
Where's the Softsoap I bought?

15:40.069 --> 15:41.157
Soap is clean.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.420
How can soap be filthy?
It's soap.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.118
I'm gonna set up
an online account for you

15:45.161 --> 15:47.424
so you have not-disgusting soap
and toilet paper

15:47.468 --> 15:50.079
and the like delivered
automatically once a month.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.647
It's not like
I'm gonna be here.Well, maybe not now,

15:52.690 --> 15:54.562
but you realize you can't
operate forever, don't you?

15:54.605 --> 15:57.521
What's that have to do with
the type of soap I use?

15:57.565 --> 15:58.870
Keep living in denial.

16:04.920 --> 16:09.620
"Dr. James Conners, PhD.
Psychotherapist."

16:09.664 --> 16:11.318
Is this how you're
working the problem?

16:11.361 --> 16:14.843
Shrink we were forced
to see in Guam

16:14.886 --> 16:18.064
gave me that doctor's number;
it's nothing.

16:18.107 --> 16:22.068
You couldn't bring photos from
our house into this apartment,

16:22.111 --> 16:24.113
but this therapist's card
made it all the way from Guam?

16:24.157 --> 16:27.334
You're really reading into
something that's not there, Em.

16:29.945 --> 16:33.122
Have you called him?Why would I?

16:33.166 --> 16:34.471
When you came home,
you told me

16:34.515 --> 16:36.256
you were gonna make
some changes.

16:36.299 --> 16:39.389
Is this why you came back?
'Cause you're worried about me?

16:42.566 --> 16:44.090
I'm fine.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.005
[phone vibrating]

16:48.181 --> 16:49.747
Saved by the bell.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.836
Again.Yeah.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.973
Don't die.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.285
I'm not gonna die.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.895
I'm good.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.866
[indistinct radio chatter]

17:21.910 --> 17:25.870
12 hours ago, Armenian armed
forces violated their cease-fire

17:25.914 --> 17:29.309
with Azerbaijan in the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.180
I'll bet you that
ruffled some feathers.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.748
Azerbaijani military forces were
scrambled to the region,

17:33.791 --> 17:35.793
and after a few minor
skirmishes,

17:35.837 --> 17:37.317
the two nations are currently
at a stalemate.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.014
That's a serious
game of chicken.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.450
SONNY:
Why the hell do we
care about turf wars

17:40.494 --> 17:43.714
between countries
that I can't even spell?

17:43.758 --> 17:47.631
Azerbaijan is our only ally
in the Caspian Sea,

17:47.675 --> 17:50.112
and a deterrent to
unaligned powers in the area.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.767
With Russia and Iran
stirring the pot,

17:52.810 --> 17:54.464
we really don't want to lose
any traction.

17:54.508 --> 17:57.902
Particularly given Azerbaijan's
resources and shipping lanes.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.078
But we're not worried
about Azerbaijan

17:59.121 --> 18:00.383
falling over a stalemate.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.776
What's our angle here?

18:01.819 --> 18:03.778
The Tesirli power plant.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.258
It's a major source of power
in the country,

18:05.301 --> 18:07.216
and given all of the
attention at the border,

18:07.260 --> 18:08.783
it's an easy target.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.786
A target for who?Armenian loyalists,
Shiite militia.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.048
Foreign powers looking to
reduce American influence

18:13.092 --> 18:14.354
in the region.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.138
JASON:
Who's protecting the plant now?

18:16.182 --> 18:18.706
DAVIS:
A small group of
Azerbaijani soldiers.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.882
The Agency does have
an asset on the ground,

18:20.925 --> 18:22.449
one of their
Global Response Staff.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.973
Richard Meyers, former spec ops.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.670
His sources are
coming back with information

18:26.714 --> 18:28.194
about a pending attack.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.587
If an enemy hostile to American
interests takes the plant,

18:30.631 --> 18:32.328
they'll control the power.

18:32.372 --> 18:34.461
They could destabilize
the only American ally

18:34.504 --> 18:36.550
we have in the region.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.813
That can't happen.There's no pressure, huh?

18:38.856 --> 18:41.859
You'll be acting
in a support capacity only.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.253
Support and advise.
Keep your heads down.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.863
This is a clandestine operation.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.822
The Azerbaijani government
doesn't want to appear

18:47.865 --> 18:48.866
weak enough to need help.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.477
The U.S. can't be seen

18:50.520 --> 18:52.305
having boots on the ground
in another country.

18:52.348 --> 18:53.567
RAY: You know we're
gonna be coming

18:53.610 --> 18:55.525
right up against
Iranian airspace.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.963
We can HALO in,
foot patrol to the plant.

18:59.007 --> 19:01.923
A lot of unfriendlies in the
area if we miss our target.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.969
Beats sitting through
the change of command ceremony.

19:05.013 --> 19:08.277
Meyers will connect you
with the soldiers.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.888
Well, tell him to pick a spot,
we'll rendezvous with him.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.500
We've got some time, I suggest
you familiarize yourself

19:13.543 --> 19:15.632
with the plant's layout.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.550
[indistinct radio chatter]

19:25.816 --> 19:27.253
Hey.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.124
Look, if you're coming here to
talk to me about my head,

19:29.168 --> 19:30.256
I'm gonna throw you out
of this airplane

19:30.299 --> 19:31.561
without a parachute.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.476
This is the thanks I get
for saving your life?

19:35.957 --> 19:38.525
What's on your mind?

19:38.568 --> 19:41.223
Our new CO, Lindell,
came to see me earlier

19:41.267 --> 19:42.398
to talk about Swanny.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.879
The whole TBI thing.Okay.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.925
You're getting a reputation.
So, what'd he say?

19:47.969 --> 19:49.884
He said that he's, uh,
he's gonna bring in

19:49.927 --> 19:53.453
a physiologist, and institute
the TGPS program.
