[ lock turns ]

00:04.071 --> 00:06.238
[ breathing heavily ]

00:06.240 --> 00:09.108
Man: I don't know if this was
such a good idea.
What?!

00:09.110 --> 00:11.377
When was the last time you saw
a free carpet like this?

00:11.379 --> 00:14.213
On a corner to be picked up
for garbage? Never.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.749
It's not a carpet.
It's a rug, and it stinks.

00:18.218 --> 00:21.053
We rent a steam cleaner,
maybe spray a little febreeze.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.422
No one will know the difference.
And it's expensive, too.

00:23.424 --> 00:26.291
Department-store
quality.

00:29.562 --> 00:32.698
Oh, my god!
Geez!

00:32.700 --> 00:35.567
Man, we need to call
the police.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.269
You can't. Stop.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.171
We'll just take the rug back
to where we found it.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.507
Jason, this rug has our dna
on it now.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.443
The police might end up thinking
<i>we</i> killed this guy.
No, they won't.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.345
So, why did you kill
this guy?

00:46.347 --> 00:49.515
We didn't. It was just like we
found a free rug on the street.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.051
Yeah, so, you put it
in your car, carried it up here,

00:52.053 --> 00:55.721
And not once did it seem
a little heavy?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.489
Good rugs weigh more.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.658
We weren't gonna unroll it
on the street where we found it.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.994
What street?
I'm not sure.

01:01.996 --> 01:03.195
We dropped a friend off
at l.A.X. This morning.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.997
And on the way back,
traffic was bad.

01:04.999 --> 01:08.000
So, we took a detour and got all
turned around, and there it was,

01:08.002 --> 01:11.537
Across the street from
the garden, on the sidewalk.
Take their statements.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.172
Uh, how long are you guys
gonna be here?

01:13.174 --> 01:15.407
Our annual christmas party
is tonight.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.708
Consider it canceled.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.079
Uh, but, sir!
It's christmas.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.014
Yeah, well, bah, humbug!

01:22.016 --> 01:25.451
You've got an unidentified body
on your living-room floor.

01:25.453 --> 01:28.220
Get drunk somewhere else.
And you -- out.

01:28.222 --> 01:31.090
Out, out! Out!
Rusty: What? I've seen
dead bodies before. [ scoffs ]

01:31.092 --> 01:33.759
All right, buzz. These two
are harmless, everyday idiots.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.428
So it's okay to start filming,
and then we'll do a search,

01:36.430 --> 01:39.465
And the only reason that
you are riding along with us

01:39.467 --> 01:43.168
Is to see if you can be a team
player and follow directions.

01:43.170 --> 01:47.306
And, so far, mr. Beck,
you are doing a crappy job.

01:47.308 --> 01:50.476
Ah, ah.
Stay -- in the hall.

01:55.415 --> 01:57.416
Geez.
Why is he being so rude?

01:57.418 --> 02:00.552
Not following orders
is worse than being rude.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.721
If you want the captain
to sign papers approving

02:02.723 --> 02:05.424
Your participation
in an s.I.S. Operation,

02:05.426 --> 02:07.192
You better do
what the lieutenant says.

02:07.194 --> 02:09.661
But -- but just standing here
is boring.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.664
You expect us all to be
fascinated with your life,

02:12.666 --> 02:14.700
But you never take the smallest
interest in other people.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.603
I do so take an interest
in other people.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.606
I do that all the time.
All the time? Really?

02:20.608 --> 02:22.341
Yeah.
[ scoffs ]

02:22.343 --> 02:26.178
So, tell me, why did lieutenant
provenza become a detective?

02:26.180 --> 02:28.380
What was mike tao
going to do

02:28.382 --> 02:29.815
Before he started
working homicides?

02:29.817 --> 02:32.584
The reason you can't answer
those questions is

02:32.586 --> 02:35.220
Because you never ask people
about themselves -- ever.

02:35.222 --> 02:39.124
Not even how they're doing
in the morning.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.860
Well, I don't have to ask
how you're doing,

02:41.862 --> 02:43.862
Because you're, like,
obviously in a really bad mood.

02:43.864 --> 02:49.301
No. I'm disappointed --
again.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.537
[ sighs ]

02:51.539 --> 02:53.238
One gunshot wound straight
to the forehead,

02:53.240 --> 02:55.807
Fired at pointblank range,
no defensive wounds.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.676
So, he never saw it coming.
You have time of death?

02:57.678 --> 03:00.546
Considering the rug
was an insulator,

03:00.548 --> 03:02.181
I'm guessing
12 to 16 hours ago.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.682
So, he was killed
somewhere else and brought here

03:03.684 --> 03:05.284
By heckle and jeckle.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.286
And the only thing they remember
about the corner

03:07.288 --> 03:09.288
Was it's about 15 minutes
south of here,

03:09.290 --> 03:11.190
And there might have been
a garden nearby.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.691
I may be able to
get more specific.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.560
I ran our victim's prints
and got a hit.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.495
His name is robert keller,

03:16.497 --> 03:20.199
Age 25, graduate student,
and he has a record.

03:20.201 --> 03:23.702
Arrested in 2011 for protesting
with occupy wall street.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.171
Not a motive for murder,
really.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.639
No, but in addition
to having a record,

03:27.641 --> 03:31.643
He's listed as a witness to --
hmm...Doesn't say.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.445
A witness gets shot in the head
and rolled up in a rug?

03:33.447 --> 03:36.882
Does the, uh, victim's record
show a current address?

03:36.884 --> 03:39.151
Hmm.

03:39.153 --> 03:42.321
So, I've been thinking over,
uh, being a team player,

03:42.323 --> 03:45.190
And if this really is a team,

03:45.192 --> 03:48.527
Then shouldn't I know more
about the people playing on it?

03:48.529 --> 03:51.597
[ horn honks ]

03:51.599 --> 03:54.533
You asking a question
about us?

03:54.535 --> 03:56.802
Yes. Why is that
such a huge surprise?

03:56.804 --> 03:59.805
It's not like
I'm an egomaniac.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.541
I am interested
in other people.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.875
Okay.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.877
All right.
What are you interested in?

04:05.879 --> 04:10.449
Well, you know, like, w-why did
you become a police officer?

04:10.451 --> 04:13.619
Uh...'cause
I'm scared of fire.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.955
I'd rather be shot at
than stand on the roof

04:16.957 --> 04:20.826
Of a burning building
surrounded by flames.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.829
Plus, I enjoy telling people
what to do.

04:23.831 --> 04:27.532
It's fulfilling.

04:27.534 --> 04:30.535
And, uh, what about you,
lieutenant flynn?

04:30.537 --> 04:33.605
Oh, god. Do the short version,
please.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.609
When I was a kid,
my older brother and I,

04:37.611 --> 04:40.646
We, uh, "borrowed" a motorcycle
belonged to my cousin

04:40.648 --> 04:42.347
And took it for a joyride.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.850
And this cop,
officer nichols,

04:44.852 --> 04:48.553
He caught us
and brought us downtown,

04:48.555 --> 04:51.857
Showed us the jail, and said,
"this is where you're headed."

04:51.859 --> 04:54.826
Now, my brother, he didn't think
too much of officer nichols.

04:55.995 --> 04:59.564
But, me, I decided,

04:59.566 --> 05:02.868
Better putting people in jail
than going there myself. Right?

05:02.870 --> 05:05.804
So, you were almost
a criminal.
Ah, here we are.

05:09.609 --> 05:13.345
Okay, enough about us.
Now, about you.

05:13.347 --> 05:16.815
You stay by my side
until I say differently.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.785

two morons talked about.

the victim was rolled in.

Oh, there's blood on it,
too, sir. This is the place.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.666
Why is a college kid
living here when campus
is only blocks away?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.535
It's pretty far outside
the fence.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.905
Mike, you have an apartment
number for our victim?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.740
I think it's that one.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.710
And how do you know that,
detective beck?

brenda's husband is standing.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.819
Never good to find an fbi agent
at your crime scene.

05:56.456 --> 06:00.926
When l.A.P.D. Searched
keller's fingerprints on
afis, we were notified.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.694
Why would
the fbi be notified

06:02.696 --> 06:04.596
Unless our victim was involved
in an fbi investigation?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.631
He was.
And did you say victim?

06:06.633 --> 06:08.333
He did. You are?

06:08.335 --> 06:11.303
Detective shawn mcelroy,
rampart division.

06:11.305 --> 06:13.972
Last 10 months, I've been
running a joint task force
down here with the fbi.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.408
Wires, undercover --
whole nine yards.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.411
Keller was our only witness
to a gang shooting.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.079
You're saying
he was murdered?

06:21.081 --> 06:23.915
Yeah, we found his body a few
miles away, about an hour ago.

came to check on keller,

Why are you just standing
outside his apartment?

Even if someone
had broken in,

06:53.914 --> 06:56.415
This dog would have had them
for lunch.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.949
The killer knew the victim.
Uh...

06:57.951 --> 07:00.118
And the dog.
Yeah, buzz, what do you got?

07:00.120 --> 07:03.522
The garden across
the street -- I think
it belonged to our victim.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.424
Garden plans.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.058
Sykes:
Found the victim's wallet.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.761
Contains cash and credit cards,
so probably not a robbery.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.764
Sir. This is where keller was
shot, and here's the casing.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.132
Tao: Robert keller writes
in his journal --

07:14.134 --> 07:16.468
"witnessing tyler's murder
proved to me

07:16.470 --> 07:18.770
How important
the work I'm doing here is."

07:18.772 --> 07:20.372
Who's tyler?
Tyler rhodes --

07:20.374 --> 07:22.607
That was the boy that keller
saw being shot to death

07:22.609 --> 07:24.910
By the 12th street rounders.
Sanchez:
Rounders run this territory.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.812
They specialize in
protection rackets.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.147
Tyler rhodes --
is that his memorial out front?
Yeah.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.784
Okay, special agent howard,
detective mcelroy,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.853
I would like all of your
crime reports, your notes --

07:34.855 --> 07:38.023
Oh, hold on. I've been working
this task force almost a year.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.926
Keller was my witness.
You can't expect me to just
hand my case over to you.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.028
Well, fine. Fine.
If I can't expect you to do it,

07:43.030 --> 07:46.097
I'll <i>order</i> you to do it.
And since it's connected,

07:46.099 --> 07:48.166
We'll take the tyler rhodes
murder, as well.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.835
Exactly.
Wait, wait, wait.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.636
Look, considering who
robert keller's father is,

07:51.638 --> 07:53.705
I think we should be
sharing information.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.776
Why?
Who's robert keller's father?

07:57.778 --> 08:00.779
Congressman steven keller. He's
on his way up here right now.

08:00.781 --> 08:04.115
He'll be looking for answers.
Tell me we have some.
Not yet.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.786
Sir, the bullet that killed
our victim has been analyzed.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.988
Its casing doesn't match any
weapon in the nibin database.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.157
But the motive, chief,
is related

08:12.159 --> 08:14.960
To the victim's role
as a witness in a gang murder.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.929
What? The joint task force was
collaborating with this boy?

08:17.931 --> 08:20.632
Sir, two weeks ago,
robert keller saw three members

08:20.634 --> 08:22.734
Of the rounders shoot
a teenage boy in the head.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.637
And you left keller out there?
Whose brilliant idea was that?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.506
It was keller's.
We tried to get him to leave.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.574
But he wanted to serve
as an example of the community.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.076
Why wasn't I informed
of this?

08:31.078 --> 08:35.180
I am a listed supervisor
of this joint task force.

08:36.015 --> 08:40.051
The fbi wanted to withhold
all names related to this murder

08:40.053 --> 08:42.220
While we wrapped up
our rounders investigation,

08:42.222 --> 08:45.857
Which we will try and do
in about two weeks.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.528
No. We're not sitting on this
murder until after christmas.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.129
With all due respect, chief,
you didn't mind us

08:51.131 --> 08:52.931
Sitting on things
when we were only dealing

08:52.933 --> 08:54.766
With the murder
of a 15-year-old black boy.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.807
People may be created equal,

09:02.809 --> 09:05.143
But they sure as hell
don't die that way.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.146
Witnesses hold pride of place
in our justice system.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.181
You want to make this
about race?

09:10.183 --> 09:12.050
Here we have two white guys

09:12.052 --> 09:15.153
Who withheld vital information
from a black supervisor.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.522
I'll tell you what -- let's take
color out of the equation

09:17.524 --> 09:20.926
While we deal with
how badly you both screwed up.

09:20.928 --> 09:24.195
Chief taylor, if we could just
move forward for a moment first.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.065
Assuming
that robert keller's murder

09:27.067 --> 09:30.001
Was related to his role
as a witness,

09:30.003 --> 09:32.170
Perhaps major crimes
could have access

09:32.172 --> 09:35.674
To the joint task force
surveillance of the rounders.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.909
That's not possible, captain.
[ telephone rings ]

09:37.911 --> 09:39.844
We'll return to this issue
in a minute.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.813
And while the congressman
is here,

09:41.815 --> 09:44.149
I expect 100% support
from everyone.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.151
Yes.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.919
All right. [ sighs ]

09:49.856 --> 09:51.923
Sir.

09:52.959 --> 09:55.660
Assistant chief taylor,
I appreciate the courtesy

09:55.662 --> 09:56.995
You're showing me
by having this meeting.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.064
Of course, congressman keller.
Of course.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.166
Come in.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.234
And I speak
for the entire department

10:03.236 --> 10:07.539
When I say how very,
very sorry we are for your loss.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.840
Thank you.

10:08.842 --> 10:12.177
Special agent fritz howard
of the fbi, sir.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.713
The bureau extends its sympathy
to you and your family.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.916
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.951
And I am struggling.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.054
My son ryan and I are struggling
to understand why,

10:23.056 --> 10:24.322
Given robert's importance

10:24.324 --> 10:26.324
As a witness
in a federal investigation,

10:26.326 --> 10:28.326
He was not afforded
more protection.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.196
[ clears throat ]
detective mcelroy, sir.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.831
Your son declined
to be moved

10:32.833 --> 10:36.334
And refused a security detail
on three occasions.

10:36.336 --> 10:40.005
We even had him sign
a waiver.

10:42.775 --> 10:44.709
Why wasn't I notified
my son declined protection?

10:44.711 --> 10:48.680
Congressman keller,
I'm captain sharon raydor,

10:48.682 --> 10:50.115
And I am the officer
in charge

10:50.117 --> 10:51.916
Of investigating
your son's murder.

10:51.918 --> 10:55.620
Unfortunately, robert was 25
and legally an adult.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.789
You're telling me
that my son died

10:57.791 --> 11:01.893
Because of some bullshit
right to privacy?

11:01.895 --> 11:07.065
Sir, right now, the l.A.P.D.
And the fbi are working together

11:07.067 --> 11:09.834
In the neighborhood
where your son was living.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.871
We have officers
and wire taps in place.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.206
It won't be long until somebody
talks about this crime,

11:15.208 --> 11:18.943
And we'll be able to make
an arrest.
Just a moment.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.713
Is that a suggestion
that law enforcement not
immediately respond?

11:21.715 --> 11:23.915
Dad, just --
no.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.818
Because I am recommending
a serious change

11:26.820 --> 11:28.186
In your do-nothing work day!

11:28.188 --> 11:32.791
I want -- no, I demand --
that every officer,

11:32.793 --> 11:35.827
Every detective,
and every fbi agent

11:35.829 --> 11:38.830
Involved in this task force turn
that neighborhood upside down

11:38.832 --> 11:41.166
Until you find the animals
who murdered my son!

11:41.168 --> 11:43.768
Dad, please, stop.
This isn't helping anything.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.905
Robbie wouldn't want you
to do this.
Ryan, please. Please.

11:46.907 --> 11:52.110
Agent howard, I trust
I've made myself understood.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.112
You have.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.781
But I should remind
you, congressman, I
don't work for you,

11:56.783 --> 11:59.284
And neither does anyone
in the l.A.P.D.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.720
And if you attempt to interfere
with a criminal investigation

12:01.722 --> 12:03.822
Using your position
or influence

12:03.824 --> 12:05.323
As a member of
the house of representatives --

12:05.325 --> 12:06.925
Excuse me, agent howard.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.727
If I may, congressman,

12:08.729 --> 12:13.098
Because your son was shot during
a task-force investigation,

12:13.100 --> 12:17.035
It's very likely we already have
the killer's phones wired.

12:17.037 --> 12:20.405
Taylor: Just waiting two days,
we might hear the murderers

12:20.407 --> 12:23.208
Confess on their cellphones
or land lines.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.143
I'll give you 48 hours.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.046
And, agent howard, don't think
for one minute that I'll forget

12:28.048 --> 12:30.248
That you threatened me
on the day that my son died.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.952
Don't think I'll forget it.

12:33.954 --> 12:37.388
I'll be back this evening
for a briefing on your progress.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.408
[ telephone ringing ]

12:59.044 --> 13:00.378
Rusty: Hey.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.914
Uh, there's nothing else
for me to do, uh,

13:02.916 --> 13:04.916
And I've been following
lieutenant provenza's
instructions perfectly,

13:04.918 --> 13:07.252
So, can you sign off
on the permission forms

13:07.254 --> 13:10.021
Allowing me to participate
in a police operation?

13:10.023 --> 13:12.290
First, there's lots else
for you to do,

13:12.292 --> 13:13.458
And they're not
just permission forms.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.226
It's a series
of five agreements.

13:15.228 --> 13:18.129
I have to read all of them
before I can sign anything.

13:18.131 --> 13:23.034
Yeah, go help buzz upload and
organize his crime-scene video.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.502
Move away from the board.

13:27.273 --> 13:30.975
[ clears throat ] sykes, where
are we on the first victim?

13:30.977 --> 13:33.845
Uh, tyler rhodes --
15 years old, gunned down

13:33.847 --> 13:35.513
Outside of the apartment
building where he resided,

13:35.515 --> 13:37.882
Across the way
from robert keller.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.918
Why was robert keller
living in a gang neighborhood?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.352
Well,
according to his journal,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.521
It was to help
those less fortunate

13:43.523 --> 13:45.156
By converting
their neighborhoods

13:45.158 --> 13:47.926
Into enriched habitats,
one garden at a time.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.195
Flynn: Like the lot
he was using across the street

13:50.197 --> 13:52.530
From where he lived was filled
with vegetable plants.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.066
Robert keller wasn't
just planting gardens, ma'am,

13:55.068 --> 13:57.035
He was worried about
the neighborhood kids, too.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.305
He was paying tyler and
another boy $100 a week each

14:00.307 --> 14:02.974
To garden
and paint over graffiti.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.475
Sharon: Painting over
gang graffiti --

14:04.477 --> 14:06.544
That couldn't have made
the 12th street rounders happy.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.347
Provenza:
I think the congressman's son

14:09.349 --> 14:10.782
Underestimated
his vulnerability.

14:10.784 --> 14:13.117
Ma'am, detective mcelroy
just sent over

14:13.119 --> 14:14.819
A video copy
of robert keller's statement

14:14.821 --> 14:16.821
Taken the night
of tyler's murder.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.958
Man: <i>Mr. Keller, why don't we</i>
<i>go back to your apartment?</i>

14:19.960 --> 14:21.292
<i>No, I'm gonna talk to you</i>
<i>right here --</i>

14:21.294 --> 14:22.994
<i>Where everybody can see me.</i>

14:22.996 --> 14:24.963
<i>I'm not afraid, detective.</i>

14:24.965 --> 14:27.198
<i>Just let me tell you</i>
<i>what happened, okay?</i>

14:27.200 --> 14:29.367
<i>I was in my apartment.</i>

14:29.369 --> 14:33.071
<i>I heard screeching tires</i>
<i>and yelling, so I looked out.</i>

14:33.073 --> 14:37.542
<i>I saw tyler and his bicycle</i>
<i>under the front end of a car.</i>

14:37.544 --> 14:40.011
<i>Uh, can you describe</i>
<i>the vehicle?</i>

14:40.013 --> 14:42.947
<i>Yes, it was a silver</i>
<i>early-century cadillac.</i>

14:42.949 --> 14:46.818
<i>Plate number 5crd518.</i>

14:46.820 --> 14:48.319
<i>Three guys</i>
<i>got out of the car.</i>

14:48.321 --> 14:51.489
<i>They kicked tyler</i>
<i>in the face.</i>

14:51.491 --> 14:55.159
<i>And in his chest</i>
<i>and his stomach.</i>

14:55.161 --> 14:57.295
<i>Then there was a gun, and they</i>
<i>pointed it at tyler's head.</i>

14:57.297 --> 15:02.600
<i>They fired three times.</i>
<i>Drove away.</i>

15:02.602 --> 15:04.302
Do you remember anything
<i>about these men?</i>

15:04.304 --> 15:06.604
<i>They were black,</i>
<i>maybe 20, 21 years old.</i>

15:06.606 --> 15:08.439
<i>They all had tattoos.</i>

15:08.441 --> 15:10.975
<i>One was a 12 with a circle</i>
<i>around it on the guy's neck.</i>

15:10.977 --> 15:12.510
Buzz, stop it there,
please.

15:12.512 --> 15:16.314
So, robert keller was able to
describe an identifying tattoo

15:16.316 --> 15:18.850
On one of tyler rhodes'
murderers

15:18.852 --> 15:20.485
And recall
the license plate.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.387
Why have there been
no arrests?

15:22.389 --> 15:24.923
Well, that specific tattoo
is really common

15:24.925 --> 15:26.524
Among
the 12th street rounders,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.526
And the vehicle with that plate
came up as stolen.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.929
It was recovered
in griffith park a week ago,

15:30.931 --> 15:33.231
Completely wiped clean.
Not a fingerprint on it, ma'am.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.100
And I'm guessing that no other
witnesses to tyler's murder

15:36.102 --> 15:37.969
Have come forward.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.971
Not from
that neighborhood, sir.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.340
Captain, ryan keller,
the victim's brother,

15:42.342 --> 15:43.975
Has come back in.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.176
Let's go.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.112
Thank you.

15:49.915 --> 15:51.382
Sanchez: Hey, buzz.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.319
Let's play the whole thing
from the beginning again.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.924
So, uh...Julio.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.393
May I ask you
a personal question?

16:02.395 --> 16:05.697
How did you decide
to join the police?

16:07.900 --> 16:09.600
Um...

16:09.602 --> 16:13.571
When I was 13, a couple of
gangsters murdered my cat, osa.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.107
I decided to keep track
of her killers

16:16.109 --> 16:17.508
So one day
I could arrest them.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.511
For killing your cat?

16:20.513 --> 16:23.047
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no.

16:23.049 --> 16:26.017
Um, eventually, I got them for,
uh, attempted murder and rape.

16:26.019 --> 16:29.020
You know, by then,
they were third strikers,

16:29.022 --> 16:31.055
So I put them away
for the rest of their lives.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.424
It felt good.

16:39.565 --> 16:43.101
Ryan: Robbie was tough,
goal-oriented, driven.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.236
He got his undergrad degree
in three years,

16:45.238 --> 16:47.438
And was getting
his master's in two.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.174
He set the bar
very high for me.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.243
I'm a third-year undergrad.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.246
Uh, we -- we were supposed to be
roommates this year,

16:55.248 --> 16:57.582
But robbie decided
it was time

16:57.584 --> 16:59.283
For him to start giving back
to his community.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.352
He believed that.

17:01.354 --> 17:05.223
You are aware that part of
giving back to his community

17:05.225 --> 17:08.426
Involved your brother using
monies from your family's trust

17:08.428 --> 17:10.695
To purchase vacant lots --

17:10.697 --> 17:12.330
Yeah, but that --
that wasn't a problem.

17:12.332 --> 17:19.003
No, robbie has -- had --
robbie had his own trust fund,

17:19.005 --> 17:21.672
And I have mine,
and they're completely separate.

17:21.674 --> 17:26.010
So, you didn't have any problem
with what robert was doing?

17:26.012 --> 17:28.012
Well, I didn't say that.

17:28.014 --> 17:31.616
Trying to change things
in a neighborhood like
that without protection --

17:31.618 --> 17:33.217
Oh, he had a serious dog.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.752
Well, max looked fierce
to you because

17:34.754 --> 17:38.222
He probably hadn't been fed
or -- or let out since robbie --

17:39.558 --> 17:41.559
[ sighs ] mm.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.429
Since robbie
was shot to death.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.733
[ inhales deeply ]
anyway, max is why I'm here.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.269
He's not a guard dog.
He's a family pet.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.337
And I was hoping
to take him home.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.106
My mother's asking
for him.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.508
Max is with animal control,
and they can't release him

17:57.510 --> 18:00.011
Until they assess
he's not a threat.

18:00.013 --> 18:01.479
Wait, a-a threat?

18:01.481 --> 18:03.081
Mm-hmm.
No, no. Oh, my god.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.283
Please don't think
I'm criticizing anybody here,

18:05.285 --> 18:07.251
But it really seems like
you are putting more effort

18:07.253 --> 18:09.387
Into holding our dog

18:09.389 --> 18:12.190
Than finding the people who
murdered my brother and tyler.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.592
Well, we will eventually
identify the three men

18:14.594 --> 18:18.096
That your brother saw
murder tyler rhodes,
but before we do that --

18:18.098 --> 18:20.398
No, there weren't three.
There were four.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.767
Three guys
got out of the cadillac,

18:22.769 --> 18:24.469
But one stayed in the backseat.
That's what robbie told me.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.671
Well, that's not
what he told the l.A.P.D.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.207
But this fourth person --

18:29.209 --> 18:31.209
Did robert say anything
about him?

18:31.211 --> 18:35.446
Only that it was a kid he'd been
helping in the neighborhood.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.715
Um, maybe a relative
of tyler's.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.485
I-I can't say for sure.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.821
But I-I know --
I know who could.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.490
Sykes:
Thank you, mrs. Rhodes,

18:45.492 --> 18:49.360
For agreeing to meet with us
this evening.

18:49.362 --> 18:52.530
Did you catch the people
that killed my boy?

18:52.532 --> 18:55.066
No, ma'am. Not yet.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.201
But we found someone
who might be able to help.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.403
Thank god.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.672
Who is this person?

19:01.674 --> 19:02.907
You, ma'am.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.512
<i>During the initial</i>
<i>investigation, a witness said</i>

19:07.514 --> 19:10.214
<i>Three people were</i>
<i>in the cadillac that</i>
<i>ran down your son.</i>

19:10.216 --> 19:13.384
We have reason to believe there
may have been a fourth person.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.586
[ scoffs ]
perhaps a relative of yours.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.889
Is this possible?

19:19.324 --> 19:21.259
I'll tell you
what I told the police

19:21.261 --> 19:23.361
Who came 'round
when my son got killed.

19:24.530 --> 19:28.466
I...Don't...
Know...Anything.

<i>Mrs. Rhodes,</i>
<i>two people are dead,</i>

<i>And we're trying to</i>
<i>put the people responsible</i>

<i>For those murders</i>
<i>behind bars.</i>

19:34.474 --> 19:37.275
<i>When it was just my baby who</i>
<i>got killed, you didn't care.</i>

19:37.277 --> 19:40.411
<i>No one ever came 'round</i>
<i>asking me about no fourth</i>
<i>person in that cadillac.</i>

19:40.413 --> 19:43.381
<i>All we got were two squad cars</i>
<i>putting flares in the street,</i>

19:43.383 --> 19:45.650
Gone the next day.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.886
Some rich white boy
gets killed,

19:48.888 --> 19:50.588
And so many police
come around,

19:50.590 --> 19:53.457
You can't get the mail
without running into them.

19:53.459 --> 19:56.294
<i>Ma'am, we canvassed</i>
<i>the neighborhood,</i>

19:56.296 --> 19:57.895
And we couldn't get anyone
to talk to us.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.897
Now, if you knew that there was
a fourth person in that cadillac

19:59.899 --> 20:01.666
And you didn't tell
the police --

20:01.668 --> 20:05.203
I don't never talk to anyone
about the rounders.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.371
And my son didn't,
either!

20:07.373 --> 20:13.244
You stand up to the rounders,
they will shoot you dead.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.547
No, no.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.485
This isn't about ty.

20:21.487 --> 20:25.823
It's about
that rich white boy.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.626
And don't you try to
tell me different.

20:28.628 --> 20:31.495
<i>Mrs. Rhodes,</i>
<i>we're doing everything we can</i>

20:31.497 --> 20:34.865
<i>To find your son's killers.</i>
<i>Her son's killers?</i>

20:34.867 --> 20:37.501
<i>But we need your help</i>
<i>to identify...</i>
<i>Her son's killers?!</i>

20:37.503 --> 20:39.203
What about <i>my</i> son's
killers?

20:39.205 --> 20:41.205
Sir, this was
a courtesy briefing,

20:41.207 --> 20:43.307
Arranged to demonstrate that
we are making progress here.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.309
In the murder
of another person's child.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.677
I am not interested
in hearing

20:46.679 --> 20:49.547
Some ghetto woman
justify her silence.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.315
Make her cooperate!

20:51.317 --> 20:54.218
Look, just because
my son lived like those people

20:54.220 --> 20:55.987
Doesn't mean he had to die
like those people!

20:57.289 --> 21:00.324
"those people"?
Oh, come on.
You know what I mean.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.361
Look, I am sorry
if I was misunderstood,

21:03.363 --> 21:05.863
But I expect progress,

21:05.865 --> 21:08.466
And apparently it's gonna be
up to me to get it.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.370
[  <i>camera shutter clicks</i>]

21:12.372 --> 21:14.872
<i>With regard</i>
<i>to my elder son's death,</i>

21:14.874 --> 21:17.408
<i>I am pleased to inform</i>
<i>the public</i>

21:17.410 --> 21:19.910
<i>That the murder investigation</i>
<i>is proceeding</i>

21:19.912 --> 21:22.513
<i>Much faster</i>
<i>than originally anticipated.</i>

21:22.515 --> 21:24.382
<i>For the last 10 months,</i>

21:24.384 --> 21:27.551
<i>There has been an l.A.P.D./fbi</i>
<i>joint task force</i>

21:27.553 --> 21:30.521
<i>In the rampart district</i>
<i>where my son's death occurred.</i>

21:30.523 --> 21:33.557
My god, he's telling them
everything.
<i>Gang members in that area</i>

21:33.559 --> 21:35.559
<i>Are being monitored</i>
<i>with wire taps,</i>

21:35.561 --> 21:37.762
<i>Undercover officers...</i>

21:37.764 --> 21:39.697
We need to start making
an arrest right now.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.332
<i>...And any and all means</i>
<i>of surveillance available</i>

21:41.334 --> 21:42.967
<i>To those two fine</i>
<i>law-enforcement agencies.</i>

21:42.969 --> 21:46.270
I can't believe he just ruined
the best chance we have

21:46.272 --> 21:48.406
Of finding
his own son's murderer.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.875
<i>...Are brought to justice.</i>

21:50.877 --> 21:52.543
[ <i>indistinct shouting,</i>
<i>camera shutters clicking</i> ]

21:59.284 --> 22:00.718
So, uh, since you're not

22:00.720 --> 22:02.586
Personally making any arrests
this morning --

22:02.588 --> 22:06.524
I haven't had time to read
the permission forms just yet.

22:06.526 --> 22:09.360
But -- but don't you already
know what they say?

22:09.362 --> 22:12.697
They were written by lawyers,
so no one knows what they say.

22:12.699 --> 22:16.300
I'm trying to solve two murders
at once, so give me a moment.

22:16.302 --> 22:18.669
[ cellphone vibrates ]
oh, good.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.372
Special agent howard,
good news?

22:21.374 --> 22:23.374
As it regards information
over our wires

22:23.376 --> 22:25.876
About tyler rhodes
and robert keller, no.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.278
As soon as the congressman
alerted everyone,

22:27.280 --> 22:29.447
Our phone lines went dead.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.882
Um, ma'am, it didn't stop us
from making an arrest, though.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.318
We're filling up the
l.A. City stadium with rounders.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.787
It's great.
Sykes:
1,000 l.A.P.D. Officers,

22:36.789 --> 22:39.690
More than 200 arrests --
merry christmas.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.559
What about tyler's cousin?
We have him.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.561
We took daryl walker
into custody 20 minutes ago.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.731
Sanchez:
He was carrying the same-caliber
gun that killed his cousin.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.632
I want to March daryl
through the stadium

22:48.634 --> 22:51.001
Before bringing him in --
let everyone know
we have him, ma'am.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.371
I'm running off to check
his weapon with ballistics.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.039
Sharon: I'll see you back
in the murder room.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.807
And thank you, everyone.
Copy that.

23:04.349 --> 23:09.520
So, 1,000 police officers
to arrest 200 people?

23:09.522 --> 23:13.657
Well, this task force
wasn't ended in the usual way.

23:13.659 --> 23:16.827
People weren't necessarily
where we thought they would be.

23:16.829 --> 23:20.831
But -- but why take them all
to the stadium instead of jail?

23:20.833 --> 23:24.702
Well, it helps to process people
out in the open,

23:24.704 --> 23:27.037
And that way, um,
gang members can see each other,

23:27.039 --> 23:28.606
And then this contest starts

23:28.608 --> 23:32.009
To be the first person
to talk to the police.

23:32.011 --> 23:35.713
So [sighs] a day like today
must be like...

23:35.715 --> 23:39.717
Why you became a police officer
in the first place, right?

23:39.719 --> 23:43.053
Well, I had no intention
of being a police officer.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.688
I only took this job

23:44.690 --> 23:47.057
So that I could help pay
jack's way through law school,

23:47.059 --> 23:50.060
And then jack was gonna help
pay my way through law school.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.595
[ chuckles ]

23:51.597 --> 23:53.664
And then?

23:53.666 --> 23:55.666
And then I got pregnant,
then I got pregnant again,

23:55.668 --> 23:59.537
And then --
and then jack left.

23:59.539 --> 24:03.407
And to be entirely honest
with you, by then,

24:03.409 --> 24:06.677
I like the law a lot better
than I like lawyers.

24:06.679 --> 24:10.848
And then there's the idea of
saving people from bad things.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.684
I like that, too.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.720
[ chuckles ]
yeah. I know.

24:16.722 --> 24:20.658
[ sighs ]

24:20.660 --> 24:22.960
Tao:
Sorry, daryl. We had to talk
to you about your cousin tyler.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.029
I didn't do nothing!

24:25.031 --> 24:26.697
If you didn't do anything,
daryl,

24:26.699 --> 24:29.066
How come we found you hiding out
in your mother's attic?

24:29.068 --> 24:32.436
I didn't need to be found.
I wasn't missing.

24:32.438 --> 24:36.407
I've been hanging out
in that attic for days.
Oh, yeah?

24:36.409 --> 24:37.975
With this?

24:37.977 --> 24:40.177
A gun, which ballistics
just confirmed

24:40.179 --> 24:43.714
Is the weapon that killed your
cousin tyler two weeks ago.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.050
<i>Daryl,</i>
<i>this can go two ways.</i>

24:46.052 --> 24:48.185
<i>One -- don't say another word,</i>

24:48.187 --> 24:49.787
And you go to prison
for the murder of your cousin.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.122
Or, two, tell us how you
came to have this gun,

24:52.124 --> 24:55.526
We go arrest the guys who really
did kill tyler, and you go free.

24:55.528 --> 24:58.896
Free?! You know what's gonna
happen to me when I leave here?!

24:58.898 --> 25:00.064
After the rounders think
I talked to you?!

25:00.066 --> 25:01.599
We could offer you
protection.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.101
You couldn't even
protect rob keller!

25:04.103 --> 25:06.704
It was crazy for the rounders
to kill him!

25:06.706 --> 25:09.673
And they did it anyway.
Rounders are psychos, man!

25:09.675 --> 25:11.976
Is there a reason why

25:11.978 --> 25:14.445
200 members
of the 12th street rounders

25:14.447 --> 25:16.447
Were arrested
and no one thought to call me?

25:16.449 --> 25:18.115
Yes, because that's not
our concern.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.884
We're only trying to
find a suspect

25:19.886 --> 25:24.088
In the murders of robert keller
and tyler rhodes.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.789
<i>Listen, daryl.</i>
<i>Robert keller saw you</i>

25:25.791 --> 25:27.525
<i>In the cadillac that ran over</i>
<i>your cousin.</i>

25:27.527 --> 25:28.859
Keller tried to protect you
by not telling us that.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.195
But now we know,
and here you are

25:31.197 --> 25:32.897
With the gun
that killed your cousin.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.899
Come on, daryl.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.501
You really want to go to prison
for the rest of your life,

25:37.503 --> 25:38.602
Or do you
want to talk to us?

25:41.139 --> 25:43.240
They grabbed me, okay?

25:43.242 --> 25:46.010
<i>Off the street.</i>
<i>Who grabbed you?</i>
<i>The rounders?</i>

25:46.012 --> 25:47.311
<i>Who else do you think?!</i>

25:51.216 --> 25:52.750
[ sniffles ]

25:52.752 --> 25:56.620
They shoved me in the backseat
of their car.

25:56.622 --> 25:59.156
Said we was
gonna go find ty.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.159
He -- [ sniffles ]

26:02.161 --> 26:04.695
[ crying ] he was just riding
his bike, man.

26:04.697 --> 26:09.700
<i>And they ran him down.</i>
<i>[</i> <i>sniffles</i> ]

26:09.702 --> 26:13.170
They put a gun in my face.
Told me I had to watch.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.140
Then they shot ty
in the head.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.910
[ sniffles ]
in the head, man!

26:19.912 --> 26:22.079
[ <i>crying</i> ]

26:22.081 --> 26:24.248
[ <i>sniffles</i> ]

26:24.250 --> 26:29.853
And they got back in the car,
drove off.

26:29.855 --> 26:32.523
They tossed the gun out.

26:32.525 --> 26:38.996
So I went back and found it,
so I could -- so I --

26:38.998 --> 26:40.764
So you could find the men
who killed your cousin

26:40.766 --> 26:42.232
And shoot them.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.268
Well, what were you gonna do
about it?!

26:44.270 --> 26:46.637
Nothing! I mean,
y'all didn't do nothing!

26:46.639 --> 26:48.205
<i>Tell us their names, daryl,</i>

26:48.207 --> 26:50.040
<i>And you'll see</i>
<i>what we do about it.</i>

26:50.042 --> 26:51.775
<i>You walked around the stadium.</i>
<i>Did you see them there?</i>

26:52.877 --> 26:54.612
Listen to me, daryl.

26:54.614 --> 26:58.015
If we have the people who killed
your cousin in custody,

26:58.017 --> 27:00.618
This is the time
to tell us.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.121
Who are they?

27:04.123 --> 27:06.890
Who are they, daryl?

27:09.594 --> 27:11.895
[ sighs ]

27:11.897 --> 27:15.065
Shorty wallace...

27:16.267 --> 27:18.135
...T-ray smith...

27:19.738 --> 27:23.007
...And lavar miller.

27:31.983 --> 27:34.151
I bet you're the one
who murdered tyler rhodes.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.953
Oh, whatever, man.
You ain't got nothing on me.

27:35.955 --> 27:39.323
You weren't driving the car
that ran tyler off the road?

27:39.325 --> 27:41.258
Before you and your friends
shot him?

27:41.260 --> 27:43.594
Tyler who, man?

27:43.596 --> 27:45.329
I have a witness.
You saw him.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.031
He went back and picked up the
gun you threw from the window.

27:47.033 --> 27:50.634
I never threw no gun from
a window! Leave me alone, bitch!

27:50.636 --> 27:53.637
Listen, you may have
some gun, but I ain't
use it to kill nobody!

27:53.639 --> 27:55.372
Interesting, because we found
your prints on the clip.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.074
I never touched that gun!

27:57.076 --> 27:59.710
Okay.
You never touched the gun,

27:59.712 --> 28:01.211
You never saw it before,
fine.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.914
Here's how it works. I got one
deal and three killers.

28:03.916 --> 28:06.183
Whoever talks first gets
a lawyer, a d.A.,

28:06.185 --> 28:08.118
Second-degree murder
with a parole date in 15 years.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.820
The other two --

28:09.822 --> 28:13.223
You don't talk, you're looking
at life without parole.

28:13.225 --> 28:16.093
I already told you, bitch,
I don't know anything.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.162
And I didn't kill nobody.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.396
T-ray did.
T-ray shot the kid.

28:20.765 --> 28:23.100
Buzz, let detective sykes
and sanchez know

28:23.102 --> 28:26.704
We have a winner in round 1,
and we are moving on.
Okay.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.206
Okay, everyone, we're switching
<i>over to robert keller.</i>

28:29.208 --> 28:33.911
All right, t-ray.
The deal for tyler -- it's gone.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.280
You missed
second-degree murder.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.682
You want to skip
the death penalty for
murdering robert keller?

28:38.684 --> 28:40.984
I could get you life without --
what you think, I'm stupid?

28:40.986 --> 28:43.854
[ chuckles ]

28:43.856 --> 28:46.223
We are sitting here,
aren't we?

28:46.225 --> 28:47.825
Wouldn't nobody kill
that keller guy.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.360
<i>If we even went near</i>
<i>that dude,</i>

28:50.362 --> 28:52.730
The whole city would come down
on us. The whole state.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.698
So, you killed tyler in front
of keller's house -- why?

28:54.700 --> 28:57.101
To scare keller away?

28:57.103 --> 28:58.802
Nobody cared anything
about scaring him away.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.771
Just making sure people know
we was in control.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.773
Lieutenant,
let's get t-ray an attorney,

29:02.775 --> 29:04.408
And you can jump in
with agent howard.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.243
Don't you think we're moving
a little fast on this deal?

29:06.245 --> 29:08.212
These guys may have lots more
to tell us.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.414
We're hearing it, emma.
Just listen.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.883
<i>He get all them people</i>
<i>to look down on us --</i>
<i>we handled that.</i>

29:12.885 --> 29:15.219
If there was a direct order
from their shot-caller

29:15.221 --> 29:16.920
To leave
the congressman's son alone,

29:16.922 --> 29:18.422
They probably
would have done that,

29:18.424 --> 29:21.859
And the rounders'
risk assessment is right.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.727
Killing a congressman's son
is probably the worst thing

29:23.729 --> 29:25.262
They could have done
to themselves.

29:25.264 --> 29:29.333
So, if the gang didn't
shoot robert keller, who did?

29:40.078 --> 29:41.411
These guys really killed
that 15-year-old kid, tyler,

29:41.413 --> 29:43.113
Just to make an example
out of him?

29:43.115 --> 29:45.149
Sounds horrible --
I've seen worse.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.718
Where did you see worse?

29:47.720 --> 29:49.720
Kabul.

29:49.722 --> 29:52.389
While I was an m.P. --
Stands for "military police" --

29:52.391 --> 29:54.224
We had interpreters, locals,

29:54.226 --> 29:56.193
And they were murdered sometimes
for helping us,

29:56.195 --> 29:58.362
Just to show what would happen
to afghans

29:58.364 --> 30:02.432
Who supported our troops.
Military police?
Is that how you became a cop?

30:02.434 --> 30:05.135
