WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:09.577
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.048
- HEY.
- HEY.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.417
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
THIS EARLY ON A SUNDAY?

00:16.450 --> 00:19.187
THOSE DON'T LOOK LIKE YOUR

00:19.220 --> 00:21.289
CHURCHGOING P.J.s.

00:21.322 --> 00:24.325
- I'M HAVING BREAKFAST.
- THERE'S NOTHING IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.061
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.796
OH OKAY, I SEE. YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:28.829 --> 00:32.100
YOU'RE IN LUCK. YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE
TASTE OF MY MAGIC HEALTH SHAKE.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.536
I TEND TO AVOID ANYTHING THAT HAS THE
WORD "HEALTH" IN IT FOR BREAKFAST.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.139
UH-HUH, AND LUNCH.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.141
AND DINNER.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.576
COME ON! A JOE LONGO HEALTH SHAKE
HAS GOT ALL THE INGREDIENTS

00:42.610 --> 00:44.212
TO BUILD A STRONG, LEAN...

00:45.846 --> 00:48.316
WELL, THIS.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.818
WELL, IT CERTAINLY SEEMS
TO PUMP UP THE EGO.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.320
FINE, I'LL HAVE A HEALTH SHAKE,

00:52.353 --> 00:54.288
BUT CAN YOU BLEND A
COUPLE DONUTS IN IT?

00:54.322 --> 00:56.490
( phone ringing )

00:56.524 --> 00:57.491
HELLO.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.160
YEAH SURE, HOLD ON.

00:59.193 --> 01:02.330
- SUZANNE HABER FOR YOU.
- OH, THAT'S AIDAN'S MOM.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.532
OH YES, AIDAN, RIGHT.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.634
AS FAR AS LENNOX'S
BOYFRIENDS GO,

01:06.667 --> 01:09.570
HE'S THE ONE I'VE BEEN LEAST
INTERESTED IN STRANGLING.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.106
HI, SUZANNE. I DON'T.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.608
BUT LET ME SEE IF LENNOX KNOWS WHERE
HE WENT AFTER HE DROPPED HER OFF.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.645
AIDAN DIDN'T COME HOME LAST
NIGHT AND HIS MOM'S WORRIED.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.152
I KNOW, I KNOW.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.387
LOOK, I DO NOT BLAME YOU
FOR WORRYING ABOUT AIDAN.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.190
IT'S SO SAD WHEN PARENTS HAVE NO
IDEA WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE DOING.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.091
IT'S INEXCUSABLE.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.498
DON'T WORRY, AIDAN'S OKAY.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.268
YEAH, NOT FOR LONG.

01:40.301 --> 01:43.404
- ♪ IT'S ALL GOOD
- ♪ All good

01:43.437 --> 01:45.273

02:01.189 --> 02:02.923
HEH, GOOD MORNING.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.625
( chuckles )

02:04.658 --> 02:07.395
OH, DUDE, I SO DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO STRANGLE YOU.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.529
WAIT, NO NO, JOE!

02:08.562 --> 02:11.332
- JOE!
- WHERE'S MY SHOES?

02:11.365 --> 02:13.567
DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR SHOES.
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE, RUN!

02:13.601 --> 02:16.637
- JOE, JOE, JOE!
- YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE, KID!

02:16.670 --> 02:18.606
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. I
DROPPED YOU OFF ONCE.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.641
JEEZ! JOE, RELAX.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.176
THERE'S NOTHING TO
FREAK OUT ABOUT.

02:22.210 --> 02:26.547
LENNOX, LENNOX, A YOUNG MAN JUST SPENT
HIS LAST NIGHT ALIVE IN YOUR BED.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.283
I WOULD SAY THAT'S A
LITTLE SOMETHING.

02:29.317 --> 02:33.621
JOE, CALM DOWN, OKAY? YOUR FACE
HAS REACHED THREAT LEVEL ORANGE.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.690
AND RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR A
LITTLE PRIVATE TALK WITH LENNOX.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.359
AGREED. START TALKING.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.293
UM, JOE, OKAY,

02:39.327 --> 02:43.331
THIS IS GOING TO BE
HARDCORE GIRL TALK.

02:43.364 --> 02:47.735
THERE MAY BE CRYING. AND LADY-PARTS
WILL BE DISCUSSED IN GREAT DETAIL.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.204
- SO?
- YEAH, UM,

02:50.238 --> 02:53.274
LADY-PARTS YOU'VE
NEVER HEARD OF.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.643
FINE, I'M GONNA GO.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.482
SO, LENNOX.

03:01.515 --> 03:05.219
( chuckles ) LOOK, I'M
NO ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.187
WHAT'S AN ENCYCLOPEDIA?

03:09.623 --> 03:11.725
UH, WELL, IT'S LIKE
WIKIPEDIA, BUT WITH FACTS.

03:11.759 --> 03:16.364
ANYWAY, IT... WELL, IT LOOKS...
IT LOOKS LIKE, UH...

03:16.397 --> 03:18.299
YOU KNOW, YOU SLEPT WITH AIDAN.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.368
YEAH, I'VE SLEPT WITH AIDAN.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.636
MM-HMM? MM-HMM.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.472
NO, JUST SLEPT!

03:24.505 --> 03:27.241
WE WERE WATCHING A MOVIE
AND WE FELL ASLEEP.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.378
- NO SEX.
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.281
( laughs ) OH, WHAT A RELIEF.

03:33.314 --> 03:36.284
- WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU LIKED AIDAN.
- I DO, I DO.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.320
YOU KNOW, IT'S A RELIEF TO NOT
WALK IN ON YOU HAVING SEX.

03:39.353 --> 03:43.257
YOU KNOW, SEX, WHICH IS TOTALLY NATURAL
AND NORMAL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE,

03:43.291 --> 03:45.793
PROVIDED, LIKE I ALWAYS SAY,
IT'S WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE

03:45.826 --> 03:47.695
A SPECIAL GUY WHO
TREATS YOU RIGHT.

03:47.728 --> 03:51.532
I KNOW, I KNOW, AND
ALWAYS USE PROTECTION.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.668
WE'VE HAD THIS INFORMATIVE
CONVERSATION LIKE 1,000 TIMES.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.804
WELL, AND AS I'VE
SAID 1,000 TIMES,

03:56.837 --> 03:58.806
THERE'S NOTHING INHERENTLY
WRONG WITH HAVING SEX,

03:58.839 --> 04:01.375
IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT
SHOULD BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.044
YOU KNOW, IT SHOULD BE A
SPECIAL MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE,

04:04.077 --> 04:07.415
AN EXPERIENCE UPON WHICH ALL YOUR
FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE BASED.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.283
A FOUNDATION, AS IT WERE.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.818
( snoring )

04:10.851 --> 04:14.054
"THANKS, AUNT MEL.
YOU'RE THE BEST."

04:14.087 --> 04:15.689
AW, SWEETIE,

04:15.723 --> 04:17.491
ANYTIME.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.746
- READY?
- READY.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.617
- OH OH!
- WHOA, WHAT? IS MY KISSING THAT BAD?

04:43.651 --> 04:46.720
I SWEAR I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
WITH THAT PILLOW YOU GAVE ME.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.856
OH NO NO NO. YOUR
KISSING HAS IMPROVED.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.759
IT JUST, UM... IT'S
YOUR FACIAL HAIR.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.595
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S LIKE...

04:54.628 --> 04:56.630
IT'S LIKE THREE HAIRS.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.433
RYDER, YOU'VE GOT TO... NO.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.469
- ( snaps )
- ( whimpers )

05:01.502 --> 05:04.104
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- MY THERAPIST AND I

05:04.137 --> 05:05.873
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON
GETTING RID OF...

05:05.906 --> 05:08.776
BOSSY HOLLY AND I'M
SUPPOSED TO DO THIS...

05:08.809 --> 05:11.379
( whimpers ) ...EVERY
TIME I CATCH MYSELF

05:11.412 --> 05:13.547
THINKING CONTROLLING THOUGHTS.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.849
THAT'S GREAT, HOLLY.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.421
WHAT WAS THAT?

05:20.454 --> 05:23.391
I WAS THINKING
CONTROLLING THOUGHTS.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.792
ABOUT WHAT?

05:24.825 --> 05:27.428
SQUEAKY MOUSE,

05:27.461 --> 05:30.764
UM, IF YOU WANTED TO SHAVE

05:30.798 --> 05:33.834
I WOULDN'T BE AGAINST IT.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.404
OH. UM...

05:36.437 --> 05:39.607
I GUESS I COULD. I'VE
JUST NEVER DONE IT BEFORE

05:39.640 --> 05:42.843
AND MY DAD'S NOT AROUND SO I WAS KINDA
HOPING I COULD GET JOE TO TEACH ME.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.413
JOE? NO, I'LL TEACH YOU.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.448
I MEAN...

05:47.481 --> 05:50.518
IF YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU,

05:50.551 --> 05:51.952
I'M HAPPY TO.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.789
- HOLLY, WOULD YOU PLEASE HELP...
- YES, I WILL!

05:56.790 --> 05:58.592
OH, OW.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.894
IT'S LIKE KISSING A CACTUS.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.834
HEY.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.871
I JUST HAD THE STRANGEST
FEELING OF "DEJA JOE."

06:11.972 --> 06:13.674
DIDN'T YOU ALREADY GO FOR A RUN?

06:13.707 --> 06:16.710
I WASN'T RUNNING. THIS
TIME I WAS CHASING.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.748
AIDEN DITCHED ME. HE TOOK
THE COWARD'S WAY OUT

06:20.781 --> 06:22.450
AND HID IN A CHURCH.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.485
NEED TO BURN OFF SOME RAGE,

06:24.518 --> 06:26.520
SO I DID 1,000 SQUATS

06:26.554 --> 06:28.956
AND, UH, LIFTED A CAR.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.792
AWW, JUST LIKE BABY SUPERMAN.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.861
I'M ACTUALLY THINKING
ABOUT THIS, THOUGH.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.963
IT'S ALMOST BETTER THAT
I DIDN'T CATCH HIM.

06:35.996 --> 06:39.600
NOW I HAVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE.
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHEN I'M COMING.

06:39.633 --> 06:43.837
I COULD, UH, POP OUT FROM BEHIND
A BUSH OR FROM UP UNDER A BENCH.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.839
OR REACH UP FROM
OUT OF A TOILET.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.875
IF I HAVE TO, YEAH.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.913
LOOK, THE POINT IS, FEAR OF THE
UNKNOWN IS SCARIER THAN ANYTHING.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.582
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

06:54.615 --> 06:57.651
I HOPE WHEN YOU HAD YOUR LITTLE CHAT WITH
LENNOX, YOU PUT THE FEAR OF GOD IN HER.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.920
OR BETTER YET, THE FEAR OF JOE.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.923
UH, YEAH. I WASN'T
GOING FOR FEAR.

07:02.956 --> 07:06.527
AND ANYWAY, LENNOX TOLD ME SHE
AND AIDEN DIDN'T DO ANYTHING...

07:06.560 --> 07:09.630
NO SEX AT ALL. NADA.
NINGUNO SEXO.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.966
I'M GONNA BELIEVE THAT,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.003
BECAUSE, UM, I JUST REALLY
NEED TO BELIEVE THAT.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.739
I MEAN, LENNOX AND I HAD AN
OPEN, HONEST DISCUSSION.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.909
I TOLD HER THAT SEX IS A
NORMAL, HEALTHY PART OF LIFE.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.711
OKAY, THAT'S JUST SICK.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.015
SEE? THAT THERE IS WHY WE DIDN'T
INCLUDE YOU IN THE DISCUSSION.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.017
HEY, AUNT MEL, JOE.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.787
LISTEN, AUNT MEL, I'M REALLY GLAD
WE HAD THAT TALK THIS MORNING

07:33.821 --> 07:36.557
ABOUT SEX AND BOYS

07:36.590 --> 07:37.858
AND THAT YOU WERE
SO UNDERSTANDING.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.931
UH, LOOK, IF I COULD
JUST POINT OUT...

07:43.964 --> 07:45.966
UH, HEH,

07:45.999 --> 07:48.769
HERE'S WHAT I'M...
LOOK, THE POINT IS...

07:48.802 --> 07:50.504
THERE IS NO WAY...

07:52.973 --> 07:54.675
I'M GONNA GO FOR A RUN.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.245
HE MEANS WELL. WELL, NOT REALLY,

07:58.278 --> 08:00.047
BUT HE LIVES HERE AND
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

08:00.080 --> 08:03.050
SO I'VE GIVEN WHAT YOU
SAID A LOT OF THOUGHT.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.986
- EXCELLENT.
- I DO LOVE AIDEN.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.055
- MM-HMM.
- I THINK HE'S SPECIAL

08:08.088 --> 08:09.857
- AND HE TREATS ME RIGHT.
- MM-HMM.

08:09.890 --> 08:13.060
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR
ADVICE AND HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.028
MM-HMM.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.966
I'M GONNA GO FOR A RUN.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.311
OKAY, SO CHECK IT:

08:31.344 --> 08:32.913
I'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH SOME STUFF,

08:32.946 --> 08:34.715
YOU KNOW, BURNING
OFF A LITTLE RAGE

08:34.748 --> 08:37.718
AND ABOUT, LIKE, SIX LBS.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.954
ANYWAY, WHATEVER CRAZY
CRAP YOU TOLD LENNOX,

08:40.988 --> 08:43.724
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS SHE IS NOT HAVING SEX.

08:43.757 --> 08:44.758
RIGHT.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.061
YET.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.966
- WHAT?
- UH, LENNOX TOLD ME

08:53.000 --> 08:56.003
SHE IS GONNA HAVE SEX
WITH AIDEN THIS WEEKEND.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.074
THAT'S GOOD.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.913
WHAT ELSE DID YOU SHARE WITH HER
IN THIS HORMONAL PEP TALK YOU HAD?

09:05.946 --> 09:08.716
WELL, I TOLD HER SEX IS SOMETHING
SPECIAL, MEANINGFUL...

09:08.749 --> 09:10.584
IT SHOULD BE DONE WITH
SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.119
DAMN! SHE USED MY OWN
COOLNESS AGAINST ME.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.588
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS, BURKE.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.725
YOU JUST GAVE HER PERMISSION. YOU
PRACTICALLY DROVE HER TO A CHEAP MOTEL,

09:17.758 --> 09:19.793
CHECKED HER IN AND PUT ON
THE "WACKA WACKA" MUSIC.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.663
I REMEMBER MY FIRST TIME.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.765
IT WAS AWFUL. I WAS 16.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.867
IT WASN'T THE RIGHT GUY,
IT WASN'T THE RIGHT PLACE

09:26.900 --> 09:28.869
AND IT WASN'T FOR
THE RIGHT REASONS.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.904
I'M GUESSING IT WASN'T
WHEN YOU WERE 16.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.107
- I LOOKED 16.
- OH MY GOD.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.746
WILL YOU JUST PLEASE LEARN FROM
YOUR MISTAKES THEN AND STOP THIS?

09:38.779 --> 09:41.882
THERE IS NO STOPPING THIS.
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE HER FIRST.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.884
AIDEN'S SWEET.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.786
HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE
STUDENT COUNCIL.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.687
HE'S AN EXCELLENT SOCCER PLAYER.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.756
IS HE A GREAT SOCCER PLAYER?
THAT'S GREAT?

09:48.789 --> 09:51.892
MAYBE WE COULD JUST CHEER HIM ON
THEN AND PERHAPS SHOUT "GOAL."

09:52.926 --> 09:55.796
I'M JUST SAYING AT LEAST
IT'S SOMEONE LIKE AIDEN

09:55.829 --> 09:59.032
INSTEAD OF SOME GUY NAMED TODD
WHO INSTALLS CAR SPEAKERS.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.735
FOR EXAMPLE.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.904
THE POINT IS, WE'RE LUCKY.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.774
I THINK AIDEN IS THE
ONE GETTING LUCKY.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.408
YEAH, WELL, IT'S
HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND,

10:08.441 --> 10:10.177
SO YOU'D BETTER MAKE
YOUR PEACE WITH IT.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.781
NO ONE'S GONNA GET ANY PEACE.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.849
OF ANYTHING.

10:19.987 --> 10:23.156
HEY, HOLLY. I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
READY FOR MOVIE NIGHT.

10:23.190 --> 10:27.060
OUR TRADITIONAL SATURDAY NIGHT POPCORN...
AIR POPPED, NO BUTTER, NO SALT.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.129
DECAF ICE TEA, EASY ICE,
SPRIG OF FRESH MINT

10:29.162 --> 10:31.765
AND TWO AND HALF TWIZZLERS EACH.

10:31.799 --> 10:35.969
PERFECT, BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF ONE IMPORTANT THING.

10:36.003 --> 10:36.937
OH. NO, DON'T WORRY.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.406
I ALREADY USED
ANTIPERSPIRANT ON MY HANDS.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.874
THEY'LL BE DRY FOR HOURS.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.076
NO, YOU FORGOT ABOUT THE...

10:44.945 --> 10:47.147
WHAT? JUST SPIT IT OUT ALREADY.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.149
YOU FORGOT ABOUT
SHAVING YOUR FACE.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.952
RYDER, I BROUGHT ALL THE SUPPLIES.
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.087
I DON'T KNOW.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.424
I PROMISE, SQUEAKY MOUSE, YOU'VE
GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.459
I HAVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.062
- YOU DO?
- MM-HMM.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.967
SEE? SILKY SMOOTH.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.002
YOU MAY STROKE UP TO MID-CALF.

11:10.203 --> 11:14.775
- KNEE.
- UP TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING THE PATELLA.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.180
OH, LET'S DO THIS.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.853
JOE, JOE, YOU WILL NEVER GUESS

11:25.886 --> 11:27.721
WHAT SOMEONE PUT
IN THEIR GARBAGE.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.891
IT'S TRUE. ONE MAN'S TRASH
IS ANOTHER MAN'S...

11:30.924 --> 11:32.893
GUESTS.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.729
MEL, HAVE YOU MET
AIDEN'S PARENTS?

11:35.763 --> 11:36.997
THIS IS, UH, SUZANNE AND MORT.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.132
NOT IN PERSON. HELLO THERE, MEL.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.002
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
SO NICE.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.471
YEAH, IT WASN'T ACTUALLY
IN THE GARBAGE.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.273
IT WAS JUST NEXT TO IT.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.275
WELL, THIS IS A SURPRISE.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.878
YEAH, I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE TO
INVITE 'EM OVER TO TALK ABOUT,

11:50.911 --> 11:52.913
WHAT THE KIDS ARE PLANNING
ON DOING THIS EVENING.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.949
I THOUGHT THAT SUZANNE AND MORT
MIGHT HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT IT,

11:55.983 --> 11:58.752
SEEING AS HOW THEY'RE THE ACTUAL
PARENTS OF ONE OF THE TEENS

11:58.786 --> 12:00.788
- YOU'VE GIVEN PERMISSION TO HAVE SEX.
- WHAT?!

12:00.821 --> 12:02.923
PERMISSION? NO, I AM SO SORRY
JOE DRAGGED YOU INTO THIS.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.125
NO APOLOGIES NEEDED.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.160
WE ARE ALL ABOUT COMMUNICATION.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.497
I'M A COGNITIVE
BEHAVIORAL THERAPIST.

12:10.530 --> 12:14.802
- AND I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST.
- EH? A COUPLE OF HEADSHRINKERS.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.804
EH, GO FREUD.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.007
WE REALLY BELIEVE
THAT COMMUNICATION

12:20.040 --> 12:22.142
AND CONNECTION ARE ESSENTIAL

12:22.175 --> 12:25.913
- TO SUCCESSFUL CHILD-REARING.
- CRUCIAL.

12:25.946 --> 12:29.917
AND WE LOVE THE IDEA OF A
PARENT-TO-PARENT DIALOG.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.786
YES, WELL, UM...

12:32.820 --> 12:35.956
THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.193
IF WE COULD JUST GET BACK
TO THE SUBJECT AT HAND...

12:40.227 --> 12:43.530
YOU KNOW, THIS
ALLEGED POTENTIAL...

12:43.563 --> 12:45.833
THING

12:45.866 --> 12:48.068
THAT THE KIDS ARE PLANNING
FOR THIS EVENING.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.338
OF COURSE, BUT FIRST... AND
LET US UNDERLINE THIS,

12:51.371 --> 12:54.808
- WE LOVE LENNOX.
- ADORE HER.

12:54.842 --> 12:58.345
AND WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT SHE WILL
BE AIDEN'S FIRST SEX PARTNER.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.048
GOOD GOOD. WHAT?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.649
WOW.

13:02.682 --> 13:06.019
WE'VE ALWAYS TOLD AIDEN THAT HE SHOULD
TREAT HIS BODY WITH CARE AND RESPECT.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.955
AND WE HAVE THE
UTMOST CONFIDENCE

13:07.988 --> 13:10.257
IN LENNOX'S COMPATIBILITY
WITH AIDEN AS A LOVER.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.094
ARE YOU GUYS KIDDING
ME RIGHT NOW?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.963
YOU'RE BOTH NUTS,
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

13:15.996 --> 13:18.298
WHEN MY FOLKS FOUND OUT
MY SISTER WAS HAVING SEX,

13:18.331 --> 13:20.267
THE CONVERSATION BEGAN
WITH "WHEN'S THE WEDDING?"

13:20.300 --> 13:22.069
AND ENDED WITH... (
mimics shotgun cocking )

13:25.005 --> 13:27.975
UM, HI. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

13:28.008 --> 13:31.879
- IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING.
- IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.154
NOW SEE? THAT'S PERMISSION.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.267
SO THIS IS IT, HUH?

13:54.301 --> 13:56.303
WE'RE JUST GONNA BE
STANDING DOWN HERE

13:56.336 --> 13:58.939
WHILE THEY'RE UP
THERE POTENTIALLY...

13:58.972 --> 14:01.641
HAVING S-S-S...

14:01.674 --> 14:04.277
IT'S LIKE WATCHING ADULT MOVIE
FROM OUTSIDE THE THEATER.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.948
WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.917
WE'RE GONNA STOP
'EM, THAT'S WHAT.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.919
NO NO NO, JOE, YOU CAN'T.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.954
LOOK, DID YOUR PARENTS
EVER SAY ANYTHING

14:13.987 --> 14:16.189
THAT STOPPED YOU FROM DOING
SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANTED TO DO?

14:16.223 --> 14:19.326
BUT, MEL...

14:21.661 --> 14:23.196
I HATE THIS.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.200
DID I JUST HEAR A BED SQUEAK?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.038
- I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
- JOE.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.073
JOE, HOLD ON.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.908
HOW FAR ARE YOU GOING?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.110
I WAS THINKING,
LIKE, UM, MICHIGAN.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.646
WE CAN'T. WE HAVE TO BE HERE

14:39.679 --> 14:42.249
- IN CASE THEY NEED US.
- NEED US? FOR WHAT, HUH?

14:42.282 --> 14:44.317
HELPFUL TIPS? SOME ENERGY BARS?

14:44.351 --> 14:45.986
- SIT.
- NO.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.420
- SIT.
- NO.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.456
ALL RIGHT, FINE. I'LL SIT.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.325
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA
STAY, BUT I'M GONNA STAND.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.461
FINE. BE AS UNCOMFORTABLE
AS YOU WANT.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.997
I DON'T... I DON'T THINK

14:57.030 --> 14:58.698
I COULD BE ANY MORE
UNCOMFORTABLE, BURKE.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.969
I THINK YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE BETTER
ONCE YOU'VE HAD SOME MEDICINE.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.504
- MEDICINE?
- YEAH, RED OR WHITE?

15:10.177 --> 15:14.247
THERE YOU GO. THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE YOUR FACE SOFT AND SMOOTH.

15:19.219 --> 15:22.956
WHA... YOU'RE GONNA SHAVE MY
FACE WITH THAT LADY RAZOR?

15:22.990 --> 15:24.992
UH-HUH.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.027
NOW TILT YOUR HEAD BACK.

15:27.060 --> 15:30.130
( hyperventilating )

15:30.163 --> 15:33.033
- RYDER, RELAX.
- SORRY.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.103
SORRY, I CAN'T HELP IT. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
HOLDING A LITTLE PINK BUTCHER KNIFE.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.005
OKAY, ON THREE. READY?

15:38.038 --> 15:41.308
- ONE, TWO...
- AUGH!

15:41.341 --> 15:43.276
...THREE.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.048
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.284
YUP. YUP YUP.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.993
- THIS IS ALL GOOD.
- YEAH.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.062
THERE'S NOTHING NOT
GOOD ABOUT IT.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.502
- ( thuds )
- OH!

16:09.536 --> 16:12.739
SORRY. SORRY. I'M REALLY SORRY.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.442
I'M OKAY. I'M OKAY.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.315
AM I CRUSHING YOUR LEG?

16:22.349 --> 16:24.384
- NO.
- GOOD.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.456
MMM... OW OW. CRUSHING
SOMETHING ELSE.

16:33.126 --> 16:36.029
I GOTTA TELL YOU, BURKE, YOU'VE
REALLY SHOWN INCREDIBLE RESTRAINT

16:36.063 --> 16:37.164
AND STRENGTH DURING
THIS WHOLE SITUATION.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.199
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.035
YOU KNOW, FOR NOT BEING
AN ACTUAL PARENT,

16:42.069 --> 16:44.304
YOU'RE ACTUALLY... YOU'RE
A PRETTY GOOD ONE.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.807
I GUESS I AM GETTING
THE HANG OF IT.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.043
- ( chuckles )
- AND YOU...

16:50.077 --> 16:53.546
- YOU DID NOT KILL ANYBODY.
- ( both chuckle )

16:53.580 --> 16:55.215
THANK YOU FOR NOTICING.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.486
HOW YOU DOING ON THE MEDS?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.188
DOSE ME.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.156
STAT.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.825
THIS ISN'T WORKING, IS IT?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.560
NOT REALLY.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.429
IT'S WEIRD.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.464
YOU CAN HEAR THEM WATCHING US

17:11.498 --> 17:15.368
AND WAITING AND
CONDONING OUR BEHAVIOR.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.405
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE THE
LAST TWO ZOO PANDAS.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.508
I'M SORRY.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.411
I JUST DON'T REALLY WANT
TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.846
I KNOW. ALL THIS ACCEPTANCE

17:26.879 --> 17:29.316
IS MAKING ME FEEL SO DIRTY.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.152
I SHOULD GO HOME.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.591
WAIT! NO, IF MY AUNT
SEES YOU LEAVE,

17:38.625 --> 17:41.494
THERE WILL BE ALL KINDS OF
QUESTIONS, POSSIBLY A SURVEY.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.097
JUST SNEAK OUT THE WINDOW.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.133
YEAH, TRUST ME. IT'LL
BE EASIER THAT WAY.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.870
IT'S KIND OF A LONG WAY DOWN.

17:50.903 --> 17:55.242
YOU'D RATHER HAVE AN AWKWARD
CONVERSATION WITH MY AUNT?

17:55.275 --> 17:57.210
SEE YA.

18:01.181 --> 18:05.118
HEY, IT'S LENNOX.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.586
HOW WAS THE...

18:06.619 --> 18:08.521
HOW DID YOU...

18:08.555 --> 18:11.324
HEY, IT'S LENNOX.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.128
NOTHING HAPPENED.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.863
YEAH, MY FIRST TIME
WAS LIKE THAT TOO.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.266
DON'T WORRY. IT GETS BETTER.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.335
NO, I MEAN, LITERALLY
NOTHING HAPPENED.

18:22.369 --> 18:25.205
ALL WE DID WAS KISS. AIDEN
WENT HOME HOURS AGO.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.307
WHAT? WHY?

18:27.340 --> 18:30.243
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, HAVING ALL
THESE ADULTS AND PARENTS KNOW

18:30.277 --> 18:32.179
AND EVERYTHING WAS
KIND OF A MOOD-KILLER.

18:32.212 --> 18:35.648
OH, I'M SORRY IF I WAS TOO...

18:35.682 --> 18:38.685
INTRUSIVE? NOSEY?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.453
I WAS GONNA SAY LOVING.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.323
LOOK, I KNOW I CAN'T LOCK
YOU UP IN A TOWER...

18:43.356 --> 18:46.159
JOE'S LOOKED INTO IT.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.328
I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON BECAUSE I CARE.

18:48.361 --> 18:52.265
I DIDN'T WANT THIS EXPERIENCE
TO BE A BAD MEMORY SOME DAY.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.235
OR IN NINE MONTHS.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.504
SORRY IF I WAS UNCOOL.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.707
NO, IT'S NOT UNCOOL.
IT'S LOVING.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.210
- MMM!
- ( chuckles )

19:06.946 --> 19:09.449
- JOE.
- WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?

19:09.482 --> 19:11.484
NOTHING.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.320
NOTHING?

19:13.353 --> 19:15.188
NOTHING.

19:15.222 --> 19:18.225
APPARENTLY OUR UNDERSTANDING
AND LOVING PRESENCE

19:18.258 --> 19:19.592
KILLED THE MOOD.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.562
THEY DIDN'T DO IT.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.465
♪ THEY DIDN'T DO IT, OH,
THEY DIDN'T DO IT ♪

19:25.498 --> 19:27.334
♪ OH, THEY DIDN'T DO IT.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.237
THIS IS AWESOME. THIS CALLS FOR
A CELEBRATION. YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:30.270 --> 19:32.339
I AM BREAKING OUT THE GOOD MEDS.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.308
- UH-OH.
- WHAT?

19:35.342 --> 19:38.578
- OH, THIS IS BAD.
- NO NO NO NO NO.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.213
THIS IS... THIS IS...
THIS IS GOOD.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.449
THIS IS GOOD. WE WERE AT BAD.
NOW WE'RE AT GOOD.

19:42.482 --> 19:45.485
- I LIKE GOOD.
- NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

19:45.518 --> 19:47.520
OR WITH WHO!

19:47.554 --> 19:50.490
IT COULD BE SOME DIRTBAG BASS
PLAYER IN AN OLD CAMPER SHELL.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.260
- IT'S LIKE YOU SAID...
- FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.262
MMM! FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.631
I'M GONNA BE DOING
A LOT OF RUNNING.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.775
- YOU JUST, UH, SHAVE?
- YEAH.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.678
- FIRST TIME?
- YEAH.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.248
AW, MY LITTLE
NEPHEW'S GROWING UP.

20:15.282 --> 20:18.251
( sniffs ) WHAT'S THAT
AFTERSHAVE YOU HAVE ON?

20:18.285 --> 20:20.753
YOUR FACE SMELLS LIKE
STRAWBERRIES AND JASMINE.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.323
SO DOES HOLLY'S.

20:23.356 --> 20:26.293
HEYYY!

20:26.326 --> 20:28.361
- DOUBLE STANDARD?
- YOU KNOW IT, BABY.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.368
WE JUST THINK THE KIDS SHOULD
HAVE ANOTHER GO AT IT.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.440
WE SENSE THEY MIGHT
HAVE FELT BLOCKED.

20:40.473 --> 20:43.543
BLOCKED. YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS GOING FOR.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.712
WELL, I THINK AFTER A
MISFIRE LIKE THAT,

20:45.745 --> 20:47.714
IT'S GOOD TO GET RIGHT
BACK UP ON THE HORSE.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.716
SEXUALLY SPEAKING.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.687
UH, SO YOU'RE CALLING
MY NIECE A HORSE?

20:54.721 --> 20:57.557
JOE, THEY'RE ALL YOURS.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.726
WHY THANK YOU, MEL.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.795
UH, LISTEN, I THINK THAT YOU
TWO SHOULD PROBABLY BE LEAVING

21:02.829 --> 21:05.698
BEFORE I DO SOMETHING TO YOU...

21:06.733 --> 21:08.868
THAT, UH, LANDS ME IN JAIL.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.674
I AGREE.
