not here tomorrow

the warehouse was haunted.

voice from a distance

or ask anything?

35:41.593 --> 35:42.676
What happened?

35:42.678 --> 35:43.845
This place looks
like a good place

35:43.847 --> 35:46.807
for a ghost or
whatever to hide out.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.312
Is that a doll up there?

35:52.314 --> 35:54.689
I think so.

inside of a warehouse?

been abandoned for years.

Wow.

This is awesome.

So spacious.

I wonder what it was used for.

36:27.390 --> 36:29.725
MELINDA: As storage maybe?

36:36.774 --> 36:39.024
It's just so odd.

36:39.026 --> 36:40.526
Why?

36:40.528 --> 36:43.404
Why would you say that?

36:43.406 --> 36:44.863
Well if it was
used for storage

36:44.865 --> 36:47.908
well why aren't there any boxes
or anything like that here?

were just put away?

it, what did you see?

Jimmy what are you doing?

37:05.803 --> 37:07.136
JIMMY: Just do that.

37:07.138 --> 37:09.805
Why are you filming
the stupid rat for?

37:09.807 --> 37:10.641
Look.

37:13.687 --> 37:16.314
There's another room over there.

is so scary and abandoned.

It's horrible.

Yeah.

37:33.707 --> 37:36.624
I wonder what's in those boxes?

37:36.626 --> 37:39.838
Well there's only
one way to find out.

37:57.229 --> 37:59.356
Nothing here, it's empty.

38:01.734 --> 38:04.444
- This doesn't feel right.
- What?

38:04.446 --> 38:06.821
So many empty containers.

38:06.823 --> 38:09.367
This isn't a storage warehouse.

take some pictures.

Where did you get that?

38:29.845 --> 38:32.055
Right there, it
was in the box.

38:32.057 --> 38:33.680
I wonder how it got up there?

38:33.682 --> 38:35.892
Well it's a doll.

38:35.894 --> 38:38.310
Dolls like to play, you know.

38:38.312 --> 38:40.312
She was probably
playing hide and seek.

38:40.314 --> 38:42.482
This place is so creepy.

with the others.

don't know where it is.

Is that a mannequin?

39:15.975 --> 39:18.475
Might be someone's toy.

leave it alone.

they used this place.

probably just a place

on the workers, right?

We were about to leave
when all of a sudden

41:45.417 --> 41:48.084
we saw fog come out of nowhere.

41:48.086 --> 41:49.877
It's true you
guys, we were there

41:49.879 --> 41:53.925
and it was clear as day
but then I turned around

41:55.468 --> 41:57.843
and I saw some fog, we saw
some fog and we just got

41:57.845 --> 41:59.970
only a few pictures of it.

things happening here.

spooky with the doll.

mean with a doll?

- We saw one too.
- You did?

we took some pictures

42:12.943 --> 42:15.444

back it was gone.

something there in the fog!

- That's right.

we took the picture.

idea, I have no idea.

The mannequin's gone.

42:34.423 --> 42:36.089
We took pictures, he was there.

We went back, he
wasn't there anymore.

telling me this now?

hear anything?

gotten up and left.

strange to be coincidences.

here and we have to decide

43:04.537 --> 43:05.953
whether we want to
spend the night here

43:05.955 --> 43:08.705
and get to the bottom of this.

- Or, you guys, we could

43:11.711 --> 43:14.002
always think about
it or come tomorrow?

leave it's okay,

your decision.

I'm not saying that we
spend the night here,

consider all of Bonnie's choices

long night in hell.

Hello?

59:59.176 --> 01:00:00.343
Is anybody here?

01:00:00.345 --> 01:00:01.805
The door's open.

Goddamn wind.

01:00:23.575 --> 01:00:24.410
Hey.

01:00:27.705 --> 01:00:29.872
Are you a security guard?

01:00:29.874 --> 01:00:31.332
What are you
guys doing in here?

01:00:31.334 --> 01:00:33.417
Did you bust the
lock on that door?

01:00:33.419 --> 01:00:36.796
You know you're trespassing,
this is private property.

01:00:36.798 --> 01:00:37.796
You shouldn't be here.

01:00:37.798 --> 01:00:38.798
Yeah.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.091
I'm Mary Ann.

01:00:40.093 --> 01:00:42.218
This is Larry, one
of my partners.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.095
We're paranormal investigators.

01:00:45.097 --> 01:00:46.471
One of your partners?

01:00:46.473 --> 01:00:48.473
- Yeah.
- How many of you are there?

01:00:48.475 --> 01:00:53.145
We're six in total but
two are currently missing.

01:00:53.147 --> 01:00:55.605
What do you mean missing?

01:00:55.607 --> 01:00:57.649
She doesn't
necessarily mean missing,

01:00:57.651 --> 01:00:59.151
more like there's two
girls just running around

01:00:59.153 --> 01:01:01.863
the warehouse trying
to play tricks on us.

01:01:01.865 --> 01:01:03.113
Yeah so we're
just checking out,

01:01:03.115 --> 01:01:05.659
just for paranormal activity.

01:01:08.287 --> 01:01:12.040
Something just shut the
door when I came in here.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

01:01:14.461 --> 01:01:16.169
Did you get to see it?

01:01:16.171 --> 01:01:20.425
I think it was the wind but
there was a doll right there.

01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:27.263
There's no way that doll
could have moved by itself.

01:01:27.265 --> 01:01:30.060
You'd be surprised,
sir, honestly.

01:01:34.814 --> 01:01:36.314
- Yeah.
- It was there?

01:01:36.316 --> 01:01:39.691
Welcome to the
devil's warehouse.

01:01:39.693 --> 01:01:45.073
Where evil comes to play.

01:01:45.075 --> 01:01:48.993
Bonnie!

01:01:48.995 --> 01:01:50.453
Bonnie!

01:01:50.455 --> 01:01:51.745
Bonnie's not here, I told you.

01:01:51.747 --> 01:01:54.290
You were not paying
attention to me.

01:01:54.292 --> 01:01:56.084
That thing in the
fog dragged her away.

01:01:56.086 --> 01:01:58.338
It's not gonna let her go.

01:02:02.258 --> 01:02:04.091
We can't just
give up like that.

01:02:04.093 --> 01:02:05.384
FREDDY: Come on man.

01:02:05.386 --> 01:02:07.053
We can't leave
without Bonnie, man!

Bonnie is not in this place
anymore, I told you, listen!

gone, she's not here.

going, I'm talking to you man!

dolls, they walked away.

did they walk away?

No she's not a child.

No, Mary Ann.

you're a murderer.

How did this happen? He was
fine just a little while ago.

Let me look.

01:04:52.428 --> 01:04:54.345
Yeah he's dead, alright.

Looks like he hit his
head and it killed him.

he hit his head

01:04:59.019 --> 01:05:00.267

Yes.

mean he wasn't pushed.

stop trying to blame me

that happens here?

It's supposed to be a haunted
warehouse, not a death trap.

Wait, you didn't see
all the locks on the doors

and the signs that say keep out?

01:08:02.493 --> 01:08:05.662

warehouse has the same sign.

don't you understand?

she's not talking about

that kind of sign.

something warning people

that this place
is real dangerous.

out is keep out!

ask you something.

happening here?

some of the stories.

wasn't gonna come in here

were true at night!

what kind of stories?

- Bodies disappearing...
- Oh!

- Oh, bodies, disappearing.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:08:41.573 --> 01:08:42.823
What else?

01:08:42.825 --> 01:08:43.658
Well.

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:48.161
Over the course of a few years
a bunch of night guards quit.

01:08:48.162 --> 01:08:49.496
Couple others just disappeared.

01:08:49.497 --> 01:08:51.374
At first they
thought they quit too

01:08:51.376 --> 01:08:53.792
but they never came to
get their checks so.

01:08:53.794 --> 01:08:57.170

got suspicious, right?

01:08:57.171 --> 01:08:59.549
Yeah, a bunch of people did.

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:01.925
There was this one manager,
he thought it was all BS

01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:04.304
so he decided I'm gonna
spend the night in there.

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:06.680
So they came and opened
the place in the morning.

01:09:06.682 --> 01:09:10.935
Blood splattered everywhere,
nobody ever found the body.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.523
Wait, is that why
all the workers quit?

01:09:15.524 --> 01:09:18.568
Yeah yeah everybody got
real scary after that.

01:09:18.569 --> 01:09:19.652
They just walked off the job.

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:21.612
This place was closed
in a matter of weeks,

01:09:21.613 --> 01:09:22.988
that's what happened.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:25.282
Wait why didn't the
media report any of this?

01:09:25.283 --> 01:09:28.536
What's the media gonna
report, it was all speculation!

01:09:28.537 --> 01:09:30.621
Ghosts terrorize warehouse?

01:09:30.622 --> 01:09:33.750
And if they had reported
it it wouldn't have

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.501
- made a difference anyway.
- Oh really?

01:09:35.502 --> 01:09:37.461
GUARD: Yeah it wouldn't
have made any difference.

01:09:37.462 --> 01:09:38.712
FREDDY: Why, why
do you say that?

01:09:38.714 --> 01:09:41.758
Okay, so you see the
articles, you watch it on TV.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.343
Would that have kept
you from coming in here?

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.636
- Well...
- Huh?

01:09:45.638 --> 01:09:47.889
Actually it would have
made me more curious.

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:50.140
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

01:09:50.142 --> 01:09:52.559
You're more curious.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.353
Yeah, but you
know what they say.

01:09:54.355 --> 01:09:55.647

01:09:55.649 --> 01:09:56.482
Ah, cat.

01:09:57.650 --> 01:10:01.109
Yeah, and guess what,
meow we are the cat.

01:10:01.111 --> 01:10:02.819
Yes but we're not dead.

01:10:02.821 --> 01:10:04.404
Not today.

01:10:04.406 --> 01:10:05.572
Yeah and if we wanna
stay alive all we gotta do

01:10:05.574 --> 01:10:08.408
is beat these entities
that are out there.

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:09.702
Sounds easy right?

01:10:09.704 --> 01:10:11.036
But guess what this
thing is watching us.

01:10:11.038 --> 01:10:12.913

where we're at.

want, what are we gonna do?

All we have to do is
survive the night, okay?

01:10:27.513 --> 01:10:28.513
It's that simple.

01:10:28.515 --> 01:10:29.514

here in the daylight.

Everything that's gone
wrong happened at night.

01:10:37.065 --> 01:10:39.816
If we watch the sun
come up, we survive.

is true all we gotta do

01:10:43.404 --> 01:10:45.404
is stay alive for a
couple more hours.

- That's it.

for a second okay?

I gotta think.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.625

stay here long enough.

way better than we do.

were gonna be so malicious?

01:11:49.137 --> 01:11:50.469
I didn't know that.

01:11:50.471 --> 01:11:53.305
So what you're telling
me is that you came here

01:11:53.307 --> 01:11:56.768
and you did no research at all.

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:58.853
What kind of
investigator are you?

01:11:58.855 --> 01:12:00.647
Obviously not
a very smart one.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:01.732
Well.

After we came here
all those guards quit

01:12:06.529 --> 01:12:08.237
I did some research.

01:12:08.239 --> 01:12:11.532
This warehouse has been
haunted for a long time.

01:12:11.534 --> 01:12:12.867
What are you saying?

01:12:12.869 --> 01:12:17.663
Well, the guy who owned
this place was head of a group

01:12:17.665 --> 01:12:19.456
that kind of fancied themselves

01:12:19.458 --> 01:12:22.001
like the Illuminati
or something.

01:12:22.003 --> 01:12:23.752
Wait I've never
heard that before.

01:12:23.754 --> 01:12:26.214
Well, this group of
seven, what they did

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:27.799
they made a pact with the devil.

01:12:27.801 --> 01:12:30.593
The deal was they had to
sacrifice one child a month

01:12:30.595 --> 01:12:35.305
and then they would become rich
beyond their wildest dreams.

01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:37.265
And they did that?

01:12:37.267 --> 01:12:39.852
Yeah, as legend has it
they all became billionaires.

01:12:39.854 --> 01:12:41.228
It went on for a long time.

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:43.398
Then they just couldn't
stomach the killing anymore.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.816
It just stopped.

01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:46.733

themselves, they all went crazy.

laugh on that one.

is true then there are

Yeah, hell yeah.

But for some reason this place,
this warehouse right here

01:12:57.747 --> 01:12:59.080
is the epicenter of it all.

they look so innocent.

they can to make you

way to the front door
