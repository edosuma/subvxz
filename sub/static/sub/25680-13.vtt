10:12.404 --> 10:14.989
I am blown away
by your life here.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.784
I mean, living the beach life,
making videos.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.910
It is super sweet.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.412
It's like I always say:

10:20.495 --> 10:23.373
Come up with something later
to say that sounds smart.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.460
Well, we'll let you get back to filling
out your little college forms.

10:27.544 --> 10:28.962
Tell the family I say hi.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.255
I'll see you guys
at Thanksgiving.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.259
Okay. All right.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.721
See? I told you
I'd hook you up.

10:37.804 --> 10:38.930
Thank you, Frankie.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.682
This is gonna wipe
the coleslaw incident

10:40.765 --> 10:43.309
right off the front page
of the Schotz-Plotz newsletter.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.273
[knocking on door]

10:52.235 --> 10:54.362
Ernie? What are
you doing here?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.614
What I should
have done years ago.

10:56.698 --> 10:59.117
My whole life, I've been
focusing on becoming doctor.

10:59.200 --> 11:03.204
But after seeing how amazing
Bernie's life is here,

11:03.288 --> 11:05.874
I realized this is what
I should be doing.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.168
So, I'm giving up medicine.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.127
[Bernie and Frankie]
What?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.087
Let me finish.

11:12.088 --> 11:16.676
To become a full-time
internet video-maker.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.886
Like we said...

11:17.969 --> 11:19.304
[Bernie and Frankie]
What?

11:23.975 --> 11:25.810
-This is bad.
-So bad.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.437
Ernie is giving up
his life.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.065
The world has just lost
a brilliant future doctor.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.026
Huh? No, I'm talking
about him becoming a Vuuugler,

11:33.109 --> 11:35.070
moving in here,
and cramping my style.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.072
It's just gonna be another thing
he's better at than me.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.282
Is that seriously
what you're focusing on?

11:39.366 --> 11:40.909
What about
the whole doctor thing?

11:40.992 --> 11:42.452
What doctor thing?

11:43.745 --> 11:45.622
Have you even
seen Ernie's channel?

11:45.705 --> 11:48.458
He gave up a future
of saving lives

11:48.541 --> 11:51.169
to make videos where he spoils
the ends of movies.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.421
It's called
"Ernie Calls the Plotz."

11:54.172 --> 11:57.217
Wait! His channel is
"Ernie Calls the Plotz"?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.135
That's the worst name
I've ever heard.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.721
You think "Ernie Calls
the Plotz" is a bad name,

12:01.805 --> 12:03.973
when your channel is
"Bernie Calls the Schotz"?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.517
Why, what's weird about that?

12:06.518 --> 12:08.687
It's basically the same name!

12:09.521 --> 12:11.773
I'm not hearing
what you're hearing.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.358
Whatever, it's awful.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.152
He does spoiler alerts
without the alerts.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.237
Watch.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.072
<i>So in the end,</i>
<i>it turns out</i>

12:19.155 --> 12:20.865
the bad guy is
the good guy's dad.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.367
And they're all ghosts!

12:23.201 --> 12:25.704
I just saved you fifteen bucks.
You're welcome.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.041
Why are you laughing?

12:30.125 --> 12:31.876
Because it's so bad!

12:31.960 --> 12:34.129
Ernie stinks
at making videos.

12:34.212 --> 12:37.257
Finally, Bernie Schotz
is the cool one in the family!

12:37.340 --> 12:38.383
Bernie, you don't understand.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.509
My dad is a doctor.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.137
I couldn't live with myself
if something I did

12:42.220 --> 12:44.597
stripped the world
of a brilliant medical mind!

12:44.681 --> 12:47.308
Frankie, you're talking
about future problems.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.519
So we lost a doctor,
who cares?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.688
Name one country that doesn't
have enough doctors.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.357
-Uhh...
-Exactly, you can't.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.610
I'm talking about something
much bigger than saving lives.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.571
I'm the cool one
in the family now!

13:00.864 --> 13:02.574
His video already has
two million views.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.576
We need to make Ernie
want to be a doctor again.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.957
I'm so excited
we're doing this.

13:11.041 --> 13:15.670
We are going to crush any and all
opponents who cross our paths.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.173
Oh, um, Amelia,
there are no opponents.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.591
We're competing
against ourselves

13:19.674 --> 13:20.842
to get out of here
in under an hour.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.345
Oh. Well then,
I better watch out,

13:23.428 --> 13:25.138
'cause I'm coming for me.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.558
I'm just happy
Grandma believed us

13:28.641 --> 13:30.435
when we said we were
going to get fro-yo.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.729
Yeah, I knew if we mentioned
fro-yo, she'd bail.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.440
She calls it sad ice cream
for babies.

13:35.523 --> 13:39.611
Now if I told her
we were taking ice cream from sad babies,

13:39.694 --> 13:41.196
she definitely
would have been in.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.655
[horn blares]

13:42.947 --> 13:43.948
Oh, that's
the starting horn!

13:44.032 --> 13:45.283
The clock started.
Let's go.

13:49.704 --> 13:50.538
[locks clicks shut]

13:51.081 --> 13:53.708
All right, girls,
we're locked in.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.002
Man, you never have to pee
until they tell you

13:56.086 --> 13:57.629
you're locked in a room
for an hour.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.257
We have to find
the three hidden pyramids.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.468
The last one has the key
that opens the door.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.011
By chance do any
of the pyramids

14:05.095 --> 14:07.013
have the key
that opens the bathroom door?

14:15.271 --> 14:17.524
Paige, you found a pyramid!

14:17.607 --> 14:19.776
It was under Queen Nefertiti!

14:19.859 --> 14:22.445
Yaaas Queen!

14:22.529 --> 14:23.738
Nefertiti.

14:28.993 --> 14:29.828
[eerie music playing]

14:30.620 --> 14:31.913
It's way too creepy.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.623
Yeah, I'm not
going in there.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.751
[both]
Willow!

14:38.294 --> 14:41.047
Relax, ladies,
I ain't scared of nothin'.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.507
[cracks knuckles]

14:47.053 --> 14:49.222
Willow! You found
the next pyramid.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.392
Yep. And something
even better.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.227
It's TV's Lou Scoopmaker!

14:54.310 --> 14:59.232
Lou Scoopmaker out...
Lou Scoopmaker out...

15:00.025 --> 15:01.401
Is he okay?

15:02.068 --> 15:04.154
Um, don't worry, Lou.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.948
We're gonna escape this room
and then we'll get you home.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.325
I am home.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.369
Lou Scoopmaker
lives here now.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.831
And now over
to Cleopatra with traffic.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.129
Okay, the fake blood
is ready.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.006
I'll just pretend
to cut my thumb,

15:23.089 --> 15:24.507
and it'll gush out
of this tube.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.594
Okay, great. And then
Ernie will "save you"

15:27.677 --> 15:29.262
and remember how much
he loves helping people.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.930
He'll want
to be a doctor again,

15:31.014 --> 15:33.016
you'll pay for my meal,
and our problem's solved.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.642
I didn't agree to that last--

15:34.726 --> 15:35.602
Shh, he's coming!

15:36.102 --> 15:38.563
Hey guys, thanks
for the lunch invite.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.067
Before I spoil the end
of <i>Dinosaur Galaxy 2,</i>

15:42.150 --> 15:43.943
I gotta put some food
in my belly.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.904
Just like those dinosaurs did.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.948
They eat everybody
in the galaxy.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.494
Speaking of free rolls,

15:52.577 --> 15:53.828
Frankie, would
you like some?

15:53.912 --> 15:56.956
Yes. Just gonna use
this newly sharpened knife

15:57.040 --> 15:58.041
to put some--

15:58.124 --> 15:59.876
Oh! Ah! Oh!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.503
Oh, I cut my thumb.
Ernie, help!

16:01.586 --> 16:03.213
It's bleeding!
It's bleeding!

16:04.839 --> 16:06.508
One second.
Bernie!

16:06.591 --> 16:08.301
Stupid tube isn't working!

16:08.385 --> 16:09.302
Um...

16:09.386 --> 16:11.137
I got an idea.
Just keep screaming.

16:11.221 --> 16:12.972
-Ohhh!
-Oh, yeah.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.183
Oh, that thumb
is definitely bleeding.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.601
It's gross,
cover your eyes!

16:16.685 --> 16:17.686
Oh, man.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.062
Ahh!

16:19.145 --> 16:20.563
Okay, you can look now.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.941
Man, we could use
your help here, Ernie!

16:23.024 --> 16:25.485
This is one of the most gruesome thumb
injuries I've ever seen!

16:25.568 --> 16:27.278
Uh, that is a lot of blood.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.614
The pain is relentless!

16:29.698 --> 16:30.990
Look at all the relentlessness!

16:31.074 --> 16:32.701
She's relenting everywhere.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.994
Do something, Ernie.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.037
Okay, I'll just...
[gagging]

16:36.454 --> 16:40.000
Uh, maybe someone
else can... [gagging]

16:40.792 --> 16:43.003
Ernie, please!
This is a medical emergency!

16:43.086 --> 16:46.006
You're the only one
with the expertise to help her!

16:46.089 --> 16:47.090
I can't, okay?

16:47.173 --> 16:48.842
I don't know anything
about medicine!

16:49.843 --> 16:51.386
I don't work for a top surgeon.

16:51.469 --> 16:52.762
I wasn't first
in my high school class,

16:52.887 --> 16:53.888
I was last.

16:53.972 --> 16:54.806
I lied about--
[gagging]

16:55.890 --> 16:57.434
everything!

16:58.643 --> 16:59.477
[door bell jingles]

17:00.186 --> 17:04.149
Wow, I can't believe
that just happened.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.485
You gonna eat those rolls?

17:15.326 --> 17:18.163
Hey, Ernie.
What happened back there?

17:19.789 --> 17:22.751
This seems like a family thing,
so I'm gonna head inside.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.795
And figure out why
this fake blood thingy didn't work.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.800
Hey, what happened
back there is...

17:31.593 --> 17:33.762
my life isn't anything
like you think it is.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.347
What do you mean?

17:35.430 --> 17:37.098
I was never
class valedictorian.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.476
Okay? I wasn't
a presidential honors student.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.896
And I never saved a guy's life using CPR
at a little league game.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.606
But you showed me
that news article.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.149
It looked so real.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.610
Yeah, it's 'cause I used
a photo-editing app.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.945
Okay. I paid a guy
to use a photo-editing app.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.614
I don't know
how to photo-edit!

17:53.698 --> 17:56.159
Oh, duh.
The tube is clogged.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.744
This ought to fix it.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.456
Uh-oh.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.210
Dude, I had no idea.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.628
I'm just an average guy,
you know?

18:06.711 --> 18:08.713
Who lives with his grandma.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.965
In our basement.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.801
I even pretend
to lift heavy weights

18:12.884 --> 18:14.094
so people don't think I'm weak.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.929
Wow, Ernie.
That's just sad.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.436
Hey, Ernie, I know
you're feeling down,

18:23.520 --> 18:24.562
but look on the bright side.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.314
Your channel's
getting tons of views.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.857
They're all me.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.443
My life is basically
clicking refresh.

18:37.826 --> 18:41.913
It's been so hard keeping this charade
going all these years.

18:41.996 --> 18:46.084
And the saddest part is,
I just did this to impress you.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.212
Me? Why would you
want to impress me?

18:49.295 --> 18:52.132
So you'd think
I was cooler than I am.

18:52.215 --> 18:55.051
But I guess you wouldn't
understand what that's like.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.929
No, Ernie, actually,
I do understand.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.058
I'm slightly less famous
and popular

19:02.142 --> 19:03.518
than I led you to believe.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.270
Seriously?

19:05.353 --> 19:07.188
Aw man, that is deep.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.025
I just wanna sit here
for a second and take that in.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.408
Okay, I'm ready to talk again.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.243
Straight up?

19:20.326 --> 19:21.536
My friends
in the Vuuugle house

19:21.619 --> 19:23.079
made me look cooler
than I actually am.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.622
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.124
What do you mean?

19:26.207 --> 19:28.293
Bernie, I'm not jealous
of you because of your fame and success.

19:28.376 --> 19:31.421
I'm jealous because of
the close friends that you have.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.425
They really seem to love you for you, man.
Flaws and all.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.927
I don't have anyone like that.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.056
Well, you do now.
Me.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.223
You mean that?

19:42.307 --> 19:45.643
Of course, man.
What are cousins for?

19:49.314 --> 19:52.525
Hey, wanna go inside and hang out like
friends who are cousins?

19:52.609 --> 19:54.402
[both]
Frousins!

19:56.988 --> 19:58.656
[both scream]

19:59.282 --> 20:00.408
I fixed the tube.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.664
We only have
ten minutes left.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.917
The only way we're gonna
finish this

20:09.000 --> 20:11.544
is if we maintain laser focus.

20:12.921 --> 20:16.007
Ooh, "Egyptian Beauty Secrets"?

20:16.091 --> 20:18.259
This seems important.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.057
The final pyramid!

20:27.018 --> 20:28.228
[gasps]

20:29.020 --> 20:31.106
[all]
We did it! We did it!

20:31.189 --> 20:32.649
[Lou] Nice job, ladies.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.901
Lou Scoopmaker out.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.488
Yes!

20:38.571 --> 20:40.240
First ones to escape.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.659
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Whoo!

20:44.828 --> 20:45.995
Oops.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.706
Yeah. Oops.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.960
Grandma, uh,
what are you doing here?

20:52.043 --> 20:55.380
Well, since I thought we were gonna do
this escape room together,

20:55.463 --> 20:57.716
I came here to practice
to get good at it

20:57.799 --> 20:59.592
so I wouldn't let you down.

20:59.676 --> 21:02.929
I didn't know I was gonna be
the one who was let down.

21:03.054 --> 21:05.390
By you, in case that wasn't clear.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.641
Yeah, we got that.

21:07.809 --> 21:11.813
Grandma, we are so sorry
for lying to you.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.315
And we're sorry
for coming here without you.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.526
But we're most sorry...

21:16.609 --> 21:18.611
that you found out.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.865
What can we do
to make it up to you?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.450
Well...

21:30.248 --> 21:32.959
Grandma, we know where
the hidden pyramids are.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.127
We could give you hints.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.546
I don't need your hints.
I have a system.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.219
Nope, no pyramid in there.

21:48.058 --> 21:49.684
Thanks for
a great visit, Bern-man.

21:49.768 --> 21:50.935
You got it, Ern-man.

21:51.019 --> 21:51.936
Coo-coo.

21:52.020 --> 21:52.937
Tight.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.522
Yeah.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.526
That was horrifying.

22:00.403 --> 22:02.781
Hey Ernie, what are you
gonna do when you get back home?

22:02.864 --> 22:05.617
Oh actually, Bernie
convinced me to give acting a try.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.952
Oh! Acting? Really?

22:08.036 --> 22:11.331
Yeah, well. You know, acting is pretending
to be someone you're not.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.124
And that's basically lying, right?

22:14.626 --> 22:16.252
So why not try it?

22:16.336 --> 22:17.921
Who knows? I might
get my own TV show

22:18.004 --> 22:19.339
and become
rich and famous.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.174
Sure, cuz. Sure.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.592
Safe travels, Ern-Man

22:25.679 --> 22:26.888
Okay.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.725
Okay, I wish
the kid all the best,

22:30.809 --> 22:32.477
but what are the odds
that that works out?

22:32.560 --> 22:34.729
Seriously.
Acting is a long road

22:34.813 --> 22:37.232
paved with regret
and failure.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.525
I kinda feel bad for him,

22:38.608 --> 22:41.236
but I guess he'll just
have to learn the hard way.

22:41.319 --> 22:42.779
Maybe I should
get used to being

22:42.862 --> 22:45.573
the most impressive cousin
in my family after all.
