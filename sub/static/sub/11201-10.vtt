00:02.002 --> 00:04.903
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.132
<i>TEAL 'C: According to those</i>
<i>who witnessed the battle,</i>

00:07.240 --> 00:11.267
<i>the enemy is led by a young woman</i>
<i>of extraordinary powers.</i>

00:13.213 --> 00:14.771
You want Merlin's weapon for yourselves.

00:14.881 --> 00:19.147
A weapon capable of destroying
not only the Ori, but the Ancients as well.

00:19.252 --> 00:23.848
I did find one reference in that library
that might prove to be useful, Atlantis.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.949
You think the location of Merlin's weapon
is hidden in their database?

00:27.060 --> 00:28.527
I think it's worth checking out.

00:28.628 --> 00:30.323
We're looking for the names
of two planets

00:30.430 --> 00:32.921
known on Earth in ancient times
in the dialect of Old English

00:33.033 --> 00:35.831
as Castiana and Sahal. Satisfied?

00:35.935 --> 00:39.166
Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.108
Hey, Jackson, what are you doing?

00:47.213 --> 00:49.647
Oh, just trying to figure out
the location of Merlin's weapon,

00:49.749 --> 00:54.379
so we can find it in time to defeat the Ori,
hopefully save our galaxy. You?

00:54.487 --> 00:55.647
We're going for Szechwan.
You want to come?

00:55.755 --> 00:56.722
No, I'll pass.

00:58.091 --> 01:00.218
How is your search coming,
Daniel Jackson?

01:00.326 --> 01:04.126
Slowly, but I think I'm onto something.
Here, take a look at this.

01:10.336 --> 01:12.998
These are the locations of the planets
that Arthur and his knights set off to

01:13.106 --> 01:16.633
in their quest for the Sangraal,
Castiana, Sahal and Vagon Brei.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.711
Now, we searched all three
and came up empty,

01:18.812 --> 01:22.179
so I thought it was a dead end,
until I noticed this.

01:23.216 --> 01:25.810
Their coordinates form
an equilateral triangle.

01:25.919 --> 01:30.549
Now, add their departure point,
the Camelot planet, and you get

01:33.827 --> 01:35.192
a tetrahedron.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.354
A perfect pyramid.

01:37.464 --> 01:38.988
Well, that's a hell of a coincidence.

01:39.099 --> 01:43.035
Exactly, and it means something.
I'm just not sure what.

01:51.544 --> 01:52.738
(VALA PANTING)

01:52.846 --> 01:55.974
I have the answer. I've figured it out.

01:57.717 --> 02:01.346
- Those three planets are part of a puzzle.
- This much I already know.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.981
The pyramid is a visual representation
of "three into one."

02:05.091 --> 02:06.149
Three addresses into one.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.624
That's what Morgan
was trying to tell you,

02:07.727 --> 02:09.820
that the Sangraal is located on a planet

02:09.929 --> 02:13.126
the address of which is made up of
symbols from each of those three worlds,

02:13.233 --> 02:18.000
Castiana, Sahal, Vagon Brei.
It just came to me in a dream.

02:24.444 --> 02:27.345
Okay, this program will cross-reference
the addresses in the database

02:27.447 --> 02:29.472
with those of Castiana,
Sahal and Vagon Brei,

02:29.582 --> 02:30.913
searching out planetary designations

02:31.017 --> 02:33.679
made up of symbols
from all three addresses.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.123
Given the number of symbols and
the amount of addresses in the database,

02:38.224 --> 02:40.988
we could be looking at dozens,
maybe hundreds, of permutations.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.488
(SIGHS)

02:48.268 --> 02:49.326
(BEEPING)

02:52.205 --> 02:54.230
Or maybe just the one.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.412
JACKSON: The culture and
level of technology looks similar

04:12.518 --> 04:14.486
to what we found on the Camelot planet.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.647
MITCHELL: Yeah, I'm going to assume
that's a good thing.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.625
I think some of these folks have
figured out we're not from around here.

04:21.728 --> 04:22.956
Excuse me?

04:23.062 --> 04:25.690
I was wondering
if we could get some help.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.127
A little information?

04:28.234 --> 04:30.532
We've come in search of the Sangraal.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.769
It's a red thing, about yea big.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.602
We know what the Sangraal looks like.

04:35.708 --> 04:38.199
It's been many generations
since anyone has come in search of it,

04:38.311 --> 04:40.779
and now you're the second group
of adventurers in less than a week

04:40.880 --> 04:42.939
to take up the quest.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.142
The second group?

04:45.251 --> 04:48.015
A number of Jaffa passed through here
three days ago.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.782
Were they accompanied by anyone?

04:49.889 --> 04:54.053
Yes. They were led by a man who clearly
commanded their fear and respect.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.354
Ba'al has been here.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.258
And he's got a three-day head start on us.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.126
If you truly seek the Sangraal,

04:59.232 --> 05:02.531
you must consult with the
<i>Parchment of Virtues</i> in the village library.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.502
It will prepare you for the journey to come.

05:05.605 --> 05:08.597
Over there? Thank you.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.368
But I should warn you,

05:11.477 --> 05:14.742
no one has ever returned
from the quest alive.

05:14.847 --> 05:18.112
If you value your lives,
you would do well to reconsider.

05:18.217 --> 05:22.210
We appreciate that,
but that is quitter talk.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.964
Hello!

05:35.468 --> 05:37.629
Right, <i>Parchment of Virtues.</i>

05:37.737 --> 05:39.728
Do we look under "P" for "parchment"
or "V" for "virtues"?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.808
I'd say look for any and all materials
related to the Sangraal.

05:42.909 --> 05:46.640
Or you could simply ask me.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.611
I am Osric, keeper of the village archives.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.949
Hi. We're looking for something called
the <i>Parchment of Virtues.</i>

05:55.054 --> 05:59.957
Another band of stalwart heroes
come to tempt fate

06:00.059 --> 06:03.688
in the hopes of claiming
the legendary prize.

06:04.831 --> 06:08.892
- What do you know of the Sangraal?
- Only what I have heard from legend.

06:09.001 --> 06:12.960
That it is located in a cave
beyond the outlying forest,

06:13.072 --> 06:16.701
but that the journey there
is fraught with peril.

06:18.311 --> 06:25.240
Ages ago, Morgan Le Fay
enchanted the area with a terrible curse.

06:27.954 --> 06:31.685
Since then, it has claimed countless lives.

06:31.791 --> 06:34.624
Well, we don't put much stock in curses.

06:34.727 --> 06:38.823
Yeah, well, neither did Phaedra,
the cobbler's wife.

06:38.931 --> 06:42.162
Several weeks ago,
she set off in search of her son

06:42.268 --> 06:44.998
who had strayed too far from the village.

06:45.104 --> 06:49.234
Neither have been seen nor heard
from since.

06:49.342 --> 06:53.574
This parchment was purportedly
left behind by Morgan herself

06:53.679 --> 06:56.944
as a guide for knights of noble spirit,

06:57.049 --> 07:02.783
since it is said that only the most virtuous
will succeed in claiming the Sangraal.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.417
"Only those of virtue true
may win the prize concealed.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.790
"Beyond the reach
of the flawed and tainted,

07:08.895 --> 07:13.389
"the Sangraal shall instead belong to he
who speaks the guardian's name."

07:13.499 --> 07:14.761
The guardian's name?

07:14.867 --> 07:20.066
They say that the Sangraal is protected
by the most powerful of magical beasts.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.765
A dragon.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.175
Dragon?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.575
You doubt the legend?

07:26.679 --> 07:29.671
Well, I'm sure the Sangraal is protected
by something very powerful,

07:29.782 --> 07:32.410
but I don't think it's an actual dragon.

07:32.518 --> 07:34.281
OSRIC: (SCOFFING)
Believe what you will.

07:34.387 --> 07:38.221
With luck, you may have the opportunity
to prove the truth for yourselves.

07:38.324 --> 07:43.023
"Prudence, wisdom, charity,
kindness and faith.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.257
"Let these be your guide
on this perilous quest."

07:48.534 --> 07:51.833
Well, I'm sorry, but I think we're going to
need a little bit more than that to go on.

07:51.938 --> 07:56.841
No, all Morgan left behind
was this parchment

07:56.943 --> 08:00.003
and the map.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.808
- There's a map?
- Yes.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.884
- May we see it?
- No.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.043
Why not?

08:07.153 --> 08:08.916
I showed it to the last group
of adventurers

08:09.021 --> 08:10.955
who came in search of the Sangraal,

08:11.057 --> 08:14.083
and they rewarded my trust
by trying to take it.

08:14.193 --> 08:18.425
Yeah, we know the guy
that runs that operation.

08:19.265 --> 08:20.527
We're not like him.

08:20.633 --> 08:24.125
Well, I'm sorry.
It's not for public view.

08:24.237 --> 08:28.298
Hey! We wouldn't dream
of trying to steal it.

08:28.774 --> 08:29.832
(OSRIC CHUCKLES)

08:29.942 --> 08:30.042
- We have to steal it.
- We are not stealing the map.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.909
- We have to steal it.
- We are not stealing the map.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.503
Nightfall, sneak in
under cover of darkness.

08:35.615 --> 08:38.709
Maybe I can just talk to Osric and
convince him that our cause is virtuous.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.445
That's brilliant,
and while you're distracting him,

08:40.553 --> 08:41.781
the rest of us can steal it.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.686
For the last time, we are not...

08:44.790 --> 08:47.315
Are you certain I cannot tempt you
with a final meal?

08:47.426 --> 08:50.793
What is it with this town
and the "no-can-do" attitude?

08:50.897 --> 08:54.663
Every time we turn around, someone's
trying to write us off or scare us away.

08:54.767 --> 08:59.704
I apologize. I should have said, "A final
meal before you set off on your journey."

08:59.805 --> 09:01.773
Well, that's better.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.638
Although, it need be said,
in the many thousands of years

09:04.744 --> 09:08.874
that adventurers have been seeking
the Sangraal, not one has succeeded.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.178
(PEOPLE CLAMORING OUTSIDE)

09:27.066 --> 09:30.593
What is this? What do you want here?

09:40.913 --> 09:43.347
We are soldiers of the Ori,

09:43.449 --> 09:46.907
and we have taken this village
as part of their holy crusade

09:47.019 --> 09:50.011
to rid this galaxy of evil.

09:50.122 --> 09:53.717
Cooperate, and you won't be harmed.

09:56.362 --> 09:59.525
Go through the buildings.
Bring everyone out.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.064
Who are these men?

10:07.206 --> 10:10.607
Well, that is a long story.

10:12.511 --> 10:16.709
Look, I know you have no reason to trust
us any more than you do those guys...

10:16.816 --> 10:19.717
I have not seen you shoot anyone.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.548
That's an excellent point.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.814
We're going to need your help.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.633
They've got a dozen men
guarding the gate,

10:39.739 --> 10:41.570
another 50 or so in and around the village.

10:41.674 --> 10:45.166
- Is that what I think it is?
- The contents of the library.

10:53.419 --> 10:57.412
You have spent your time
ignorant to the truth,

10:57.523 --> 11:02.551
stumbling aimlessly through the darkness
cast upon your world

11:02.662 --> 11:05.460
by the trappings of the past,

11:05.564 --> 11:10.433
but now, the path to fulfillment
stands revealed,

11:10.536 --> 11:15.803
and the time has come
to embrace a new faith.

11:21.947 --> 11:27.044
Let the light of Origin show you the way.

11:53.512 --> 11:55.571
You've encountered them before.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.774
Many times and on many different worlds.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.443
And how did the inhabitants
of those other worlds resist them?

12:00.553 --> 12:01.577
They didn't.

12:01.687 --> 12:03.450
They either surrendered
or they were slaughtered.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.423
What are you saying, there's nothing
we can do? We are doomed?

12:06.525 --> 12:07.890
No, no, not necessarily.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.291
We believe they can be defeated.
That's why we're here.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.761
We think that's why they're here as well,

12:11.864 --> 12:15.300
to destroy the one thing
capable of stopping them.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.368
The Sangraal.

12:16.702 --> 12:17.999
(BANGING ON DOOR)

12:21.474 --> 12:23.908
OSRIC: Please, I know they're here.
Please...

12:29.048 --> 12:32.211
I must speak with you.
The soldiers are looking for me.

12:32.318 --> 12:33.307
Why?

12:33.419 --> 12:35.751
Because they believe
I can lead them to the Sangraal.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.618
- Can you?
- Well, of course!

12:37.723 --> 12:40.089
What... You saved the map?

12:40.192 --> 12:43.457
No, they unwittingly burned it
with the rest of the village archives,

12:43.562 --> 12:46.360
but a copy still exists.

12:46.465 --> 12:47.591
Where?

12:48.534 --> 12:49.626
Here.

12:49.735 --> 12:52.431
I will lead you to Merlin's treasure.

12:52.538 --> 12:53.664
(BANGING ON DOOR)

12:59.712 --> 13:02.977
We want the old man.
He has information we seek.

13:07.186 --> 13:09.086
Not today, fellows.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.421
Wow, this is awkward.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.494
Our army has taken this village.

13:15.594 --> 13:19.291
If you resist, there will be no escape.

13:19.398 --> 13:23.357
Now, stand aside.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.642
Oh, I think somebody
must have heard that.

13:39.718 --> 13:42.050
This way. Come quickly.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.930
You should come with us.

13:59.038 --> 14:04.772
My place is here. I'll be fine.
I'll blame everything on you.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.511
Good plan.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.557
This way.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.473
What the hell?

14:51.490 --> 14:52.752
(BEEPING)

15:01.100 --> 15:03.534
What's the matter with them?

15:03.636 --> 15:07.732
I don't know. I'm picking up
varying anomalous readings.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.074
Stronger here. Weaker here.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.168
Stronger here. Weaker here.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.943
And then rising again.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.444
Well, this is weird.
They're temporal fluctuations.

15:21.553 --> 15:22.577
Meaning?

15:22.688 --> 15:25.885
Meaning these people are trapped
in a time distortion field.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.390
Are you sure?

15:27.493 --> 15:30.587
If it's a time distortion field,
why are the leaves moving in the trees?

15:30.696 --> 15:34.655
CARTER: It could be an illusion designed to
reproduce the standing weather pattern.

15:36.335 --> 15:40.897
These readings indicate the time
within the field is extremely decelerated.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.704
I mean, these people may look like
they're standing perfectly still,

15:44.810 --> 15:47.677
but, in fact, they're moving,
imperceptibly slowly.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.771
Are they aware
of what is happening to them?

15:49.882 --> 15:51.543
Doubtful.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.880
Several years may pass
on our side of the field

15:53.986 --> 15:56.477
in the one or two seconds
it takes them to take even one step.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.351
Why don't we just go around it?

15:58.457 --> 16:02.518
Well, the outer edge of the field extends
as far as I can tell in either direction,

16:02.628 --> 16:03.890
and it has a slight curve to it.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.987
I mean, for all I know,
it could form a complete circle.

16:06.098 --> 16:08.658
We could walk for miles
and never find a way through.

16:08.767 --> 16:12.066
Sam, if you've got another idea,
I'd love to hear it.

16:12.905 --> 16:16.966
Well, I'm definitely picking up
varied readings. It's almost as if...

16:21.180 --> 16:23.410
I think I may have found a way in.

16:25.384 --> 16:28.785
There's a circuitous path of real time
winding through the temporal field.

16:28.887 --> 16:30.616
- It's a maze.
- Yeah.

16:30.723 --> 16:31.747
It's a maze.

16:31.857 --> 16:34.690
These readings are unmistakable.
I can use them to guide us through.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.283
Follow my lead.

16:36.395 --> 16:40.491
If you stray off the path, you could
wind up trapped in the distortion field.

17:21.006 --> 17:22.098
(BEEPING STOPS)

17:22.207 --> 17:25.040
- Uh-oh.
- What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

17:25.144 --> 17:27.339
"Uh-oh," you left your stove on, right?

17:27.446 --> 17:32.884
The temporal distortions
are affecting these readings. We're blind.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.123
MITCHELL: Okay, here's a stupid question.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.169
You did check the batteries in that thing
before you left Stargate Command, right?

17:52.271 --> 17:53.295
It's not the batteries.

17:53.405 --> 17:57.034
We could just retrace our steps
and try our luck with the Ori soldiers.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.110
Do you know the way back?

18:01.914 --> 18:03.814
That way.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.508
We have to be exact.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.175
Any deviation from the path of real time,

18:07.286 --> 18:09.345
and we could wind up frozen
like the rest of these people.

18:09.455 --> 18:13.186
If Morgan Le Fay left clues
as to the whereabouts of the Sangraal,

18:13.292 --> 18:14.554
then it is safe to assume

18:14.660 --> 18:17.151
that she believed
that someone would eventually reach it.

18:17.262 --> 18:21.892
It also stands to reason that our task,
though challenging, is far from impossible.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.663
Teal'c's right. She set this trap
to weed out those she deemed unworthy.

18:25.771 --> 18:30.936
There is a way out. We just have to be
resourceful and carefully think it through.

18:32.077 --> 18:36.605
Well, Arthur and his knights wouldn't have
had access to this advanced technology

18:36.715 --> 18:38.080
to guide them through,

18:38.183 --> 18:42.381
so, presumably,
the answer could be deceptively simple.

18:55.334 --> 18:56.858
Follow me.

19:09.047 --> 19:10.412
Dead end.

19:19.057 --> 19:22.117
You're right. Deceptively simple.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.927
All right, we're through.

20:03.035 --> 20:07.028
We'd better pick up the pace
if we want to cut into Ba'al's lead.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.078
OSRIC: You say that these Ori
are possessed of god-like abilities,

20:13.078 --> 20:15.273
OSRIC: You say that these Ori
are possessed of god-like abilities,

20:15.380 --> 20:16.904
and yet they are not gods?

20:17.015 --> 20:19.643
JACKSON: No, they're very powerful beings
who would have their followers

20:19.751 --> 20:22.845
believe as much
because faith is the source of their power.

20:22.955 --> 20:26.550
Faith is something that cannot be won
through intimidation and fear.

20:26.658 --> 20:30.116
If their followers have faith,
then they must truly believe.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.288
No, they only believe
because they've been misled.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.093
You see, to many
less-developed civilizations,

20:35.200 --> 20:39.660
certain advanced technologies would
strike them as supernatural in nature.

20:40.505 --> 20:44.498
Merlin wasn't a wizard,
and Morgan Le Fay was not a sorceress.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.373
- Ridiculous.
- They simply used their advanced abilities

20:46.478 --> 20:49.743
to fashion seemingly magical creations,
like the Sangraal,

20:49.848 --> 20:51.782
or that time dilation field we encountered.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.180
So you would have me believe that

20:53.285 --> 20:56.550
you are possessed of a complete
understanding of these amazing feats?

20:56.655 --> 20:59.818
No, but just because I don't know how
the trick is done doesn't make it magic.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.793
And I would argue that your inability
to comprehend such feats

21:03.895 --> 21:06.420
does, in fact,
prove their supernatural nature.

21:06.531 --> 21:10.991
Their army just ran roughshod
over your village, forced you into hiding,

21:11.103 --> 21:13.094
- now you're defending them?
- Hardly.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.605
I condemn the actions of their soldiers,

21:15.707 --> 21:20.474
but I'm in no position to judge the Ori
or their message. Not yet.

21:22.114 --> 21:27.211
Truth is elusive to those
who refuse to see with both eyes.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.650
What?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.778
(MALE VOICE
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

21:39.998 --> 21:43.559
BA'AL: I don't believe they abandoned me.
They're going to pay.

21:43.669 --> 21:46.194
All of them are going to pay.

21:49.007 --> 21:50.201
Wait!

21:52.577 --> 21:53.669
(SIGHS)

21:53.845 --> 21:58.077
Well, make yourselves comfortable.
We're going to be here a while.

22:06.525 --> 22:10.120
It won't do you any good.
Believe me, I've tried. It's a one-way door.

22:10.228 --> 22:11.525
How long have you been trapped in here?

22:11.630 --> 22:14.497
Three agonizingly tedious days.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.726
Which reminds me,
I don't suppose you have any food?

22:16.835 --> 22:18.769
What's that?

22:18.870 --> 22:20.201
That's bait.

22:20.305 --> 22:23.832
When I approached to investigate,
I unwittingly triggered the trap.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.466
CARTER: You've had the Ancient database
for months.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.442
Why did it take you so long to get here?

22:27.546 --> 22:30.106
I can't think clearly on an empty stomach.

22:41.793 --> 22:42.919
(CHUCKLES)

22:44.563 --> 22:49.159
I only possessed two of the three
addresses needed to complete the puzzle.

22:49.267 --> 22:54.000
As a result, I had significantly
more possibilities to investigate.

22:55.507 --> 22:59.102
By a process of elimination,
I was left with one prospect,

22:59.211 --> 23:02.703
and when I went in search of the planet,
it wasn't there.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.544
What do you mean it wasn't there?

23:06.651 --> 23:08.949
It wasn't where it was supposed to be.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.353
I calculated its position, I sent my ships
to its approximate location,

23:12.457 --> 23:14.357
but they couldn't find it.

23:14.459 --> 23:17.917
In the end, my only recourse
was to access it via the stargate

23:18.029 --> 23:20.520
and secure the device
with a handful of my Jaffa,

23:20.632 --> 23:25.126
and when I became trapped in here, they
set off in search of a means of freeing me.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.201
They have yet to return.

23:30.976 --> 23:32.807
Something must have come up.

23:32.911 --> 23:36.472
Obviously, Morgan must have rendered
this planet inaccessible to ships

23:36.581 --> 23:40.574
to ensure that enemies such as the Ori
could not destroy the Sangraal from orbit.

23:40.685 --> 23:42.152
You're wasting your time.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.348
I've had three days to search for a way out
of here. There's nothing inside.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.425
Well, that's the point, isn't it?

23:48.794 --> 23:51.991
The <i>Parchment of Virtues</i> told us
that we'd have to rely on five things

23:52.097 --> 23:53.997
in order to reach the Sangraal.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.590
Prudence, wisdom, charity,
kindness and faith.

23:56.701 --> 23:59.226
You're saying the parchment
was intended to be interpreted literally?

23:59.337 --> 24:00.565
Why not?

24:01.406 --> 24:03.203
We were able to make our way
through the time dilation field

24:03.308 --> 24:04.935
by patiently and carefully
negotiating the maze.

24:05.043 --> 24:08.035
In other words, we demonstrated
prudence, as opposed to recklessness,

24:08.146 --> 24:09.909
which would have stranded us.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.813
So ask yourselves,
"What does this trap exploit?"

24:12.918 --> 24:15.386
- Curiosity.
- Greed.

24:16.087 --> 24:18.282
A person approaches a chest
expecting to find treasure inside,

24:18.390 --> 24:22.019
but instead finds nothing
and gets trapped for his trouble.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.790
So in order to reverse the trap,
you have to reverse the impetus.

24:25.897 --> 24:28.229
Right. The opposite of greed is charity,

24:28.333 --> 24:29.630
one of the virtues mentioned
in the parchment.

24:29.734 --> 24:33.761
Instead of taking something,
something must be sacrificed.

24:52.524 --> 24:55.493
(CHUCKLES) Well,
that was an interesting theory.

24:55.594 --> 24:59.496
Well, we're all trapped,
so we all have to contribute something.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.284
No, wait!

25:31.062 --> 25:32.188
(CLEARS THROAT)

25:36.034 --> 25:38.502
I have nothing to donate.

25:54.486 --> 25:58.217
That particular item
holds great sentimental value.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.769
Well done. Another day in there,
I would have gone mad.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.275
Guess that makes it time to say goodbye.

26:20.111 --> 26:23.239
- It would be foolish of you to kill me.
- How so?

26:23.348 --> 26:25.646
Amongst the information I obtained
regarding the Sangraal

26:25.750 --> 26:27.581
is the name of the protector.

26:27.686 --> 26:30.553
- Protector?
- The dragon.

26:31.790 --> 26:34.850
You see? I told you there was a dragon.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.793
I'm sure there's something
guarding the device.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.193
Maybe it's a hologram.

26:39.297 --> 26:40.787
Holograms can be dangerous, you know.

26:40.899 --> 26:43.459
It could be a ship.
Flies, breathes fire, has armored skin.

26:43.568 --> 26:46.230
It's a mistake a medieval storyteller
could easily make.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.135
Then if it's based on technology,

26:48.239 --> 26:51.675
the name is no doubt a password
or a command code.

26:51.776 --> 26:55.576
Either way, if you want it,
you'll have to take me with you.

27:00.518 --> 27:04.614
You know, I hate to say this,
but he could prove useful.

27:18.003 --> 27:19.436
MITCHELL: Come on.

27:24.776 --> 27:27.574
Yet again, we find ourselves
the unlikeliest of allies

27:27.679 --> 27:29.544
joined together in common purpose.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.707
You know, the word "allies" implies
some sort of partnership,

27:31.816 --> 27:33.044
and that just isn't the case here.

27:33.151 --> 27:38.145
You see, we are going after the Sangraal,
while you are tagging along for the ride.

27:41.559 --> 27:44.653
According to the map,
the Sangraal is hidden in a cave

27:44.763 --> 27:47.027
beneath a lone mountain.

27:47.132 --> 27:49.123
Right. We're getting warm.

27:55.540 --> 27:58.998
This is it. The cave entrance.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.374
The Sangraal is located within.

28:01.479 --> 28:04.539
It's too bad you won't be coming with us.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.947
I thought I made it clear. You need me.

28:07.052 --> 28:09.020
I wasn't talking to you.

28:10.355 --> 28:14.985
Well, allow me to get out
of your line of fire.

28:15.093 --> 28:17.789
Have you lost your senses?

28:17.896 --> 28:21.024
"Truth eludes he who does not seek it
with both eyes wide."

28:21.132 --> 28:25.899
It's a quote from the <i>Book of Origin.</i>
You paraphrased it earlier today.

28:26.004 --> 28:30.407
Now, I might not have noticed, but I spent
the past year studying the good book, so...

28:30.508 --> 28:34.569
Surely, you're not basing your suspicions
on this mere coincidence?

28:34.679 --> 28:36.840
And when it came time to give up
a possession to free ourselves

28:36.948 --> 28:38.381
from the force field trap,

28:38.483 --> 28:39.848
I noticed the designs on your ring,

28:39.951 --> 28:43.751
not Celtic as one might expect given
the cultural background of this planet,

28:43.855 --> 28:45.880
but distinctly Ori.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.959
The ring was a gift
from a traveling merchant.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.288
You're making a mistake.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.523
You're the one who screwed up.
Now drop the act.

28:58.770 --> 29:03.537
It would have been so much easier
if you had remained oblivious.

29:06.010 --> 29:09.537
But now, things will be
much more difficult.

29:17.555 --> 29:20.388
Especially for you.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.632
You're doing something new
with your eyes.

29:37.642 --> 29:40.543
So the troops in the village,
the shoot-out in the tavern,

29:40.645 --> 29:41.703
that was all a set-up.

29:41.813 --> 29:43.440
More than you know.

29:43.548 --> 29:47.609
I grew impatient waiting for you
to discover the location of the weapon,

29:47.719 --> 29:49.653
so I gave you a little help.

29:49.754 --> 29:52.587
The dream I had, "three into one."
That was you?

29:52.690 --> 29:55.056
- Yes.
- So you planted the solution in Vala

29:55.160 --> 29:56.422
knowing it would lead us right to you.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.496
Apparently, Morgan put safeguards
in place

29:58.596 --> 30:01.087
to ensure the weapon
could only be secured by...

30:01.199 --> 30:05.170
What was the term again?
"Those possessing truth of spirit."

30:05.170 --> 30:05.795
What was the term again?
"Those possessing truth of spirit."

30:05.904 --> 30:09.533
I can't think of anyone more appropriate
than a former Ascended.

30:09.641 --> 30:13.077
With your help, I'll secure the device.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.008
Hate to disappoint.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.783
You've seen a demonstration
of my powers.

30:26.891 --> 30:28.688
You know what I'm capable of.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.522
So I'm offering you a choice,

30:30.628 --> 30:32.960
either we work together
to reach the device,

30:33.064 --> 30:36.090
or I'll start killing off members
of your team.

30:40.605 --> 30:43.005
- Starting with her.
- All right!

30:46.377 --> 30:48.140
We'll work together.

30:50.148 --> 30:51.513
For now.

30:59.090 --> 31:02.253
ADRIA: We thwarted all efforts against us,
crippled your fleet,

31:02.360 --> 31:05.488
met with little, if any resistance,
on the worlds that we redeemed.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.724
Opposition to the Ori is clearly hopeless,

31:07.832 --> 31:10.528
but you continue to struggle
against the inevitable.

31:10.635 --> 31:13.229
JACKSON: Yeah, well, what can I tell you?
We're optimists.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.067
Your only hope lies with Merlin's weapon.

31:15.173 --> 31:18.836
Once I take that away from you,
your defeat will be complete.

31:18.943 --> 31:20.467
Now look who's the optimist.

31:20.578 --> 31:22.739
You disappoint me, Mother.

31:22.847 --> 31:26.408
I would have expected you to see reason
by now, but it doesn't matter.

31:26.517 --> 31:29.884
Eventually, you'll have no choice
but to accept the truth.

31:29.988 --> 31:34.925
And when you do, I'll accompany you
on your path to enlightenment.

31:39.530 --> 31:41.589
You know, the second we find that thing,
she's going to kill us.

31:41.699 --> 31:44.327
- Not if we kill her first.
- That could be a bit of a problem.

31:44.435 --> 31:46.960
I don't know, we're pretty resourceful.
I'm sure we'll think of something.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.164
Yeah? Just don't do it too soon.

31:49.274 --> 31:50.969
She may not be true of spirit
and all that jazz,

31:51.075 --> 31:53.703
but she has done her homework.
I hate to say it, but...

31:53.811 --> 31:56.507
- She could prove useful.
- For the moment.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.730
"Choose the way that is just and true."

32:12.830 --> 32:16.357
It's a riddle. I'm good at these.

32:16.467 --> 32:19.800
"The way that is just and true."
Just and true...

32:24.175 --> 32:25.472
It's telling us to go that way.

32:25.576 --> 32:30.013
"The way that is just and true,"
that is, the "right" way.

32:30.381 --> 32:31.609
What...

32:31.716 --> 32:33.809
- The writing's in Ancient.
- So?

32:33.918 --> 32:35.943
So in Ancient, the word meaning
"Just and true" is very different

32:36.054 --> 32:39.148
from the word meaning "right,"
as in, "opposite of left."

32:39.357 --> 32:40.654
(CHILD CRYING)

32:40.892 --> 32:42.553
Did you hear that?

32:44.562 --> 32:46.462
It sounds like a child.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.892
- This way.
- VALA: A child in here?

32:50.969 --> 32:54.735
- It's obviously a trap.
- Or quite possibly a test.

32:55.840 --> 33:00.243
A test of what? Our stupidity?

33:07.318 --> 33:08.444
(WHIMPERING)

33:10.221 --> 33:11.620
Hey, kid.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.813
Kid, wait up.

33:18.196 --> 33:20.562
Hey, slow down, little guy.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.963
ADRIA: We're walking right into a trap.
JACKSON: No, we're not.

33:23.067 --> 33:25.228
The parchment provided us with clues
to reaching the Sangraal.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.032
It mentioned kindness as one
of the virtues that would guide us.

33:28.139 --> 33:29.697
So if we show kindness
by helping this child,

33:29.807 --> 33:31.707
it should bring us one step closer
to the device.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.333
The parchment also mentioned wisdom,

33:33.444 --> 33:36.311
which we would be demonstrating
by avoiding this trap.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.879
(METAL GEARS TURNING)

33:42.387 --> 33:44.514
MITCHELL: Hang on, kid.
We'll get you out of there.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.353
Little help here.

33:50.428 --> 33:53.591
He's tiny.
Have him squeeze through the bars.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.792
Assist us, or I will squeeze you
through these bars.

33:56.901 --> 33:58.562
JACKSON: Want to use
your powers to lift it?

33:58.669 --> 34:01.604
We're wasting our time. Let's go back.

34:16.854 --> 34:21.518
Well, how's about that.
We did pick the right way.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.457
- It's a dead end.
- We have to go back.

34:28.566 --> 34:31.194
No, it doesn't make any sense
that we would have progressed this far

34:31.302 --> 34:33.202
only to come up empty.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.337
Daniel.

34:41.646 --> 34:43.079
It's another riddle.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.376
Oh, goody.

34:45.483 --> 34:48.782
"I'm struck and cut, shaped and cooled,

34:48.886 --> 34:51.912
"then bound by rings
to release what's stored."

34:52.290 --> 34:53.621
(RUMBLING)

34:54.792 --> 34:57.659
You might want to pick things up
a little bit here.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.059
All right, well, we have to think it through.

34:59.163 --> 35:03.691
What's struck and cut and shaped
and cooled and then bound by rings?

35:07.171 --> 35:10.140
- Bound by rings...
- Key! The answer is key.

35:10.908 --> 35:12.307
<i>Clavia!</i>

35:15.847 --> 35:17.644
(RUMBLING)

35:28.459 --> 35:32.919
"I shake the earth with booming thunder,
fell forest whole and homes complete.

35:33.030 --> 35:37.160
"I influence ships, topple kings,
sweep down swift, yet remain unseen."

35:37.268 --> 35:41.568
Oh, wait, I've got this.
Suggesting a strong yet invisible force...

35:41.672 --> 35:42.661
Wind.

35:42.773 --> 35:44.104
<i>Ventio!</i>

35:54.952 --> 35:56.852
MITCHELL: Oh, for crying out loud!

35:56.954 --> 36:01.118
"Battle-scarred in times of strife,
resistant to... Resistant to..."

36:01.225 --> 36:02.385
- VALA: To what?
- I don't know.

36:02.493 --> 36:03.983
I can't translate this section of the text.

36:04.095 --> 36:06.029
Nevertheless, "battle-scarred"
would suggest...

36:06.130 --> 36:07.290
<i>Contegia!</i>

36:09.433 --> 36:11.025
(RUMBLING STOPS)

36:16.807 --> 36:17.933
Looks like that's done it.

36:18.075 --> 36:22.205
You know, come to think of it,
riddles never really were my strong point.

36:22.313 --> 36:25.612
Visual puzzles, like, "Which of these
symbols does not belong with the others,"

36:25.716 --> 36:28.617
or, "Reconfigure the tiles
to make the hidden picture."

36:28.719 --> 36:30.584
MITCHELL: Is it just me,
or is it getting hot in here?

36:30.688 --> 36:32.883
VALA: Well, now that you mention it...

36:40.231 --> 36:42.461
It is a tad toasty.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.305
- Hey, you got anything?
- No. You?

36:56.414 --> 36:58.882
No, but I'm getting a good tan.

36:59.617 --> 37:03.144
- Let's take a break.
- Okay.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.383
There's no hidden triggers
or secret passages.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.824
If there's a way through, we didn't find it.

37:10.928 --> 37:12.486
Then I suppose we should head back.

37:12.797 --> 37:14.628
Not an option.

37:16.033 --> 37:18.831
The passageways have re-sealed
behind us.

37:21.172 --> 37:24.073
Then I was right. We walked into a trap.

37:24.175 --> 37:27.110
No. We made all the right choices
to lead us to this point.

37:27.211 --> 37:29.645
I know the Sangraal lies
beyond that wall of fire.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.580
We just have to find a way through.

37:34.452 --> 37:36.579
Why don't you do something?

37:36.687 --> 37:40.487
You're the Orici. You're supposedly
possessed of significant powers.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.718
So snuff out the flame
and get us on our way.

37:42.827 --> 37:45.728
My abilities don't work that way.

37:46.530 --> 37:50.967
Of course. How does the saying go?
All flash, no photo.

37:51.068 --> 37:54.037
Actually, it's "All flash, no substance."

37:54.138 --> 37:56.003
I prefer my version.

37:58.142 --> 38:00.633
Would you care for a demonstration?

38:08.853 --> 38:11.515
Taking your life would be
a waste of my time.

38:11.622 --> 38:14.318
Which I suppose would be put
to better use complaining.

38:14.425 --> 38:17.394
Oh, jeez, why don't you two
just get a room?

38:18.996 --> 38:20.896
It's the only one left.

38:22.266 --> 38:23.631
Daniel?

38:30.408 --> 38:32.433
The parchment told us
that five virtues would guide us

38:32.543 --> 38:34.170
in our quest for the Sangraal.

38:34.278 --> 38:37.679
Prudence, kindness, charity,
wisdom and faith.

38:37.782 --> 38:41.548
Now, we displayed prudence
in finding a way out of the temporal maze,

38:41.652 --> 38:44.621
charity, in escaping the force field trap,

38:44.722 --> 38:47.156
kindness, by helping the child
and finding the hidden passageway,

38:47.258 --> 38:50.227
and wisdom, in solving the riddles.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.762
The only virtue left is faith.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.330
- Daniel!
- Jackson!

39:10.047 --> 39:12.015
Well, after you, Muscles.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.767
There it is. We've found it.
Ours for the taking.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.134
Hang on.

39:45.483 --> 39:47.610
Yeah, that's pretty deep.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.152
- I'll go.
- We'll both go.

39:50.254 --> 39:53.712
I think I'll stay here
and support you from a distance.

39:53.824 --> 39:54.813
We should all go.

39:54.925 --> 39:59.521
No, only Daniel and I will go.
The rest of you will stay.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.120
It's all right.

40:32.496 --> 40:33.861
Take it.

40:34.665 --> 40:37.065
- After you.
- I told you.

40:37.168 --> 40:38.965
Morgan put safeguards in place to ensure

40:39.069 --> 40:42.470
that someone such as myself
couldn't claim the device.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.835
Is that why you didn't just use
your powers from back there?

40:47.945 --> 40:48.934
What are you talking about?

40:49.046 --> 40:51.981
Well, you have telekinetic abilities.
I've seen you use them.

40:52.082 --> 40:54.880
You should have just snatched
the Sangraal off the dais

40:54.985 --> 40:57.977
without taking a step, but you didn't.

40:58.088 --> 41:01.387
Probably for the same reason you didn't
use your powers to lift the portcullis

41:01.492 --> 41:04.655
or kill Ba'al the second
he stepped out of line.

41:04.762 --> 41:06.855
- You can't.
- Of course I can.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.626
No. My guess is Morgan
did put safeguards in place,

41:09.733 --> 41:13.726
and that those safeguards
are neutralizing your Ori-given powers.

41:13.838 --> 41:16.102
You saw me withstand
the bullets fired against me.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.675
Yeah, thanks to your personal shield.

41:18.776 --> 41:21.711
The only powers you can manifest
originate from that pendant,

41:21.812 --> 41:24.679
and they're purely defensive in nature.

41:26.383 --> 41:28.817
Do you really want to test me?

41:34.492 --> 41:35.982
Yep.

41:37.595 --> 41:42.055
You know what?
I changed my mind about helping you.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.529
Knock yourself out.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.270
What's the holdup?

41:52.176 --> 41:53.541
Thought so.

42:01.986 --> 42:05.786
Well, I guess I'm not as true of spirit
as you thought I was.

42:05.890 --> 42:06.982
(RUMBLING)

42:09.860 --> 42:11.487
Jackson, move it!

42:22.239 --> 42:24.139
What the hell is that?

42:28.045 --> 42:30.479
We agreed there's no such thing
as a dragon, right?

42:30.581 --> 42:31.878
Yeah.

42:32.683 --> 42:34.583
(WINGS FLAPPING)

42:46.297 --> 42:48.231
(SCREECHING)

42:48.899 --> 42:51.800
Because that looks pretty real to me.
