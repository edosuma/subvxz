10:44.583 --> 10:45.917
- Thank you.

10:45.917 --> 10:47.417
- I called about your car.

10:47.417 --> 10:48.583
They towed it
to the service station,

10:48.583 --> 10:50.250
but nobody can get to it
until tomorrow,

10:50.250 --> 10:51.250
so why don t you just spend
the night here and--no charge.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.333
- That s so nice.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.917
- Sleep well, dear.

10:53.917 --> 10:55.291
- Good night.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.250
Nothing beats hot chocolate
on a stormy night...

10:57.250 --> 10:59.917
unless it s someone
delivering it to your door.

10:59.917 --> 11:01.000
This little B & B
is full of surprises.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.083
- Awesome job tonight, guys.

11:02.083 --> 11:04.959
All right, that s it
for tonight.

11:14.750 --> 11:22.250
Homework assignment--

11:22.250 --> 11:25.542
I want you all to create
a character,

11:25.542 --> 11:28.375
and I want you to know
this character inside out.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.083
The twist is that Gina
will be playing herself,

11:34.083 --> 11:35.583
as the host
of her own TV show.

11:35.583 --> 11:36.959
So next week, your characters
are all going to be guests

11:36.959 --> 11:40.750
on her show, and we will see
what happens.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.458
Got it?

11:43.458 --> 11:46.458
All right, see you next time,
guys.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.917
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.250
- Cool.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.250
♪ ♪

12:00.709 --> 12:03.500
- Excuse me.
Can you stop?

12:03.500 --> 12:11.458
I m trying to sleep.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.917
- You succeeded.
It s almost noon.

12:20.417 --> 12:23.083
- What? I was supposed to
wake up at 7:00 a.m.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.667
- Our wake-up calls are
pretty unreliable.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.458
My mother thinks you need
to sleep, she ll ignore it.

12:32.458 --> 12:33.458
- Wait, Helen is
your mother?

12:33.458 --> 12:35.375
- I m Andy.

12:35.375 --> 12:38.083
You must be Miss Brown.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.458
- What? Oh, yeah.
Just call me Diane.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.417
- She s worried about you.

12:42.417 --> 12:45.041
- Well, I m great.
I can t remember

12:45.041 --> 12:46.875
the last time I slept
more than four hours.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.333
Wow, it is pretty here.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.500
- Hello.
Everything okay up there?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.000
- Yeah.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.250
- Okay, well, come down
and have some lunch.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.917
- It was nice meeting you.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.208
- You too.

12:59.208 --> 13:02.417
- Thank you.

13:02.417 --> 13:03.875
- I apologize for the coffee
machine not working.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.959
- Tea is fine,
as long as there s caffeine.

13:10.834 --> 13:13.083
- Tammy,
would you bring

13:16.542 --> 13:18.917
some eggs Florentine
for Diane, please?

13:18.917 --> 13:20.875
- You bet.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.375
- Thanks, but I really should
get going to Shangri-la.

13:22.375 --> 13:23.500
- You know what?
The service station called,

13:23.500 --> 13:25.041
and they said that
when you went off the road,

13:25.041 --> 13:27.542
something happened
underneath your car,

13:27.542 --> 13:28.875
and it s gonna be
at least until tomorrow

13:28.875 --> 13:31.000
before they can
get it fixed.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Why don t you just
stay here

13:33.000 --> 13:34.750
until everything
gets sorted out?

13:34.750 --> 13:36.375
- I guess one more day
wouldn t hurt,

13:36.375 --> 13:37.792
but I want to pay
for my room.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.583
- Okay, I ll take it.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.709
- Enjoy your breakfast.
- Okay.

13:42.709 --> 13:44.625
- How s the art coming?

13:44.625 --> 13:45.917
- I m going in a completely
different direction--

13:45.917 --> 13:47.542
more minimalist.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.250
What do you think?

13:49.250 --> 13:50.291
- I think you re really
finding something inside.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.417
Keep looking.
You re close.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.417
- "The best thing
about this blog

14:00.834 --> 14:02.542
is the great surprises
along the way."

14:02.542 --> 14:05.875
- Here you go, Diane.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.542
- Thank you.
- You re welcome.

14:10.208 --> 14:12.917
Enjoy.

14:17.917 --> 14:19.375
- Mmm.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.834
"Forest Cove s kitchen
may not look like much,

14:21.834 --> 14:23.583
but the eggs Florentine
are egg-cellent."

14:23.583 --> 14:25.542
- Ask her.
- Oh, excuse me,

14:25.542 --> 14:26.458
but can you take
a picture of us?

14:35.667 --> 14:40.875
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.917
- We come every year
on our wedding anniversary

14:43.917 --> 14:47.583
and take the same photo.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.542
We even wear
the same clothes.

14:57.542 --> 14:59.166
- That s such a lovely
tradition.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.709
Say, um, "Forest Cove."

15:00.709 --> 15:02.333
Forest Cove.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.333
So how long have you guys
been married?

15:05.333 --> 15:07.166
- Ten years.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.709
- It s your tenth wedding
anniversary, and you come here?

15:09.709 --> 15:10.667
You don t go to Hawaii
or Italy?

15:11.750 --> 15:13.166
- Oh, well, we ve been
to those places,

15:13.166 --> 15:14.500
but we met here.
Forest Cove is special.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.000
Thank you.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.542
- I love this place.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.333
- It s great, huh?

15:19.333 --> 15:20.917
- Or something like it.
- Something like it.

15:20.917 --> 15:23.250
- Karen, pick up line two.
Karen, line two.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.667
- Andy.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.500
Welcome back, bud.
- Feels great to be back.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.333
- How was your trip?

15:29.333 --> 15:32.583
- Long, but good.

15:36.500 --> 15:40.000
- How s your mom?
- She s well.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.709
Putting me to work,

15:43.709 --> 15:45.417
meddling in people s business--
you know, the usual.

15:45.417 --> 15:46.625
- Sounds like Helen.
- Yeah.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.375
- She doing okay?
- You know, honestly,

15:48.375 --> 15:50.041
I don t know how she s kept
the place up this long.

15:50.041 --> 15:51.709
I don t know how much longer
she can do it.

15:51.709 --> 15:53.083
I mean, she can t afford
another handyman,

15:53.083 --> 15:55.083
and I leave
in a couple weeks.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.709
- Where you going
this time?

15:56.709 --> 15:58.083
- Got an assignment
in Australia.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.542
- Wow.
Must be nice.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.667
- Yeah.
It s my first cover.

16:01.667 --> 16:02.709
- Sounds like a big deal.

16:02.709 --> 16:03.834
- Yeah.

16:03.834 --> 16:05.000
- What are you gonna do about
your mom--about Forest Cove?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I don t know, it s--

16:07.000 --> 16:08.834
One second, all right?
You know what? It s her.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.000
I got to get back, man.
Talk to you later, okay?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.542
- All right, bud.

16:11.542 --> 16:15.125
Come on, fellas.
These boxes got to go out today.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.500
♪ ♪

16:19.500 --> 16:22.500
- Orchard looks good.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.959
I did notice your new
herb garden over there.

16:26.709 --> 16:29.375
- Yeah, you know,
Tammy, our waitress,

16:30.750 --> 16:33.542
she s been planting vegetables
and herbs for the restaurant.

16:33.542 --> 16:37.542
Look at the time.

16:37.542 --> 16:39.333
Aren t you supposed to be
at a conference today?

16:39.333 --> 16:42.417
- Oh, yeah, the conference.
Well, I could either be watching

16:42.417 --> 16:44.917
a PowerPoint demonstration
or be sitting here

16:44.917 --> 16:48.834
on a lovely day
with a beautiful woman,

16:48.834 --> 16:50.542
so that s a tough one.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.250
- Jared.

16:52.250 --> 16:55.333
- Lynn,
great to see you again.

16:55.333 --> 16:58.583
If I may say so,
you look absolutely stunning.

16:58.583 --> 16:59.917
- You re probably wondering
why I m speaking to you--

16:59.917 --> 17:02.792
- Well, I assumed it s cause
you just love seeing me.

17:09.458 --> 17:10.959
- No, that s not it.
We had to cancel the bug show.

17:10.959 --> 17:13.083
Great, that show was dreadful.

17:13.083 --> 17:15.208
- That show was my idea.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.625
- Such a good idea.
I mean, why on earth

17:16.625 --> 17:18.666
would you want to cancel
a show like that?

17:18.666 --> 17:20.959
- That means I have
a slot open this week,

17:20.959 --> 17:22.500
and I would like to do
a live special

17:22.500 --> 17:23.834
on "Jaunts with Jared."
- With pleasure.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.208
Oh, we ve never done
a live show before.

17:25.208 --> 17:26.959
There are
lots of possibilities.

17:26.959 --> 17:28.541
- We need it to be memorable.
It s got to be

17:28.541 --> 17:30.166
something different
than your usual shtick.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.333
- I think I ve got an idea.
Do you want to hear it?

17:32.333 --> 17:33.625
- No, I have a meeting,
but I do trust you will do

17:33.625 --> 17:34.959
whatever it takes
to get the ratings.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.417
- Oh, I will.
- I know.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.667
- What s cooking?

17:40.667 --> 17:43.375
It s so rare
I get to ask that

17:43.375 --> 17:46.875
to someone who s
actually cooking.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.291
I m trying to make
a key lime pie,

18:02.208 --> 18:04.000
but it keeps coming out
too lime-y.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.291
- Huh, better than tasting
like keys.

18:05.291 --> 18:06.291
You know,
maybe I could help.

18:06.291 --> 18:07.875
- You bake?

18:07.875 --> 18:09.959
- I know a little bit
about food.

18:09.959 --> 18:12.875
- Well, I don t want
to put you to work.

18:12.875 --> 18:14.667
- It s not work.
I love to bake, it relaxes me.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.166
- Well, in that case,
be my guest.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.375
Forest Cove is
all about relaxing.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.000
- Everyone seems
to love it here.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.375
- I still feel like everybody
that comes here is family.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.875
- I can tell.

18:25.875 --> 18:29.041
- Mom, I think the Carsons
are ready to check out.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.834
- Oh, I ll be right back.

18:30.834 --> 18:32.333
- Okay.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.083
- My mother s got you
working too?

18:34.083 --> 18:35.959
- I volunteered.

18:38.041 --> 18:40.542
- Yeah, she s good
at making people think that.

18:40.542 --> 18:41.500
- Your mom s one of the sweetest
people I ve ever met.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.667
- And that s no way
to run a business.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.375
- Your mom treats the guests
like family.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.375
Inns like these are
disappearing.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.875
They are special,
and they need to be saved.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.375
With the right publicity,

18:54.375 --> 18:55.917
this place could be
booked for months.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.583
- We don t have the money
for marketing.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.709
We can barely afford
new light bulbs.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.875
- Don t need a lot of money
to get noticed.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.250
- No wonder my mother
likes you--

19:03.250 --> 19:04.250
another person who does not live
in the real world.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.041
- You, like this pie crust,
need to chill.

19:08.041 --> 19:12.041
Gina?

19:12.041 --> 19:14.000
- Hey, how s the B & B?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.542
- I have an idea.
Instead of Shangri-la,

19:16.542 --> 19:19.959
let s do the show
about Forest Cove.

19:24.750 --> 19:27.417
- Is the altitude shorting out
your brain waves?

19:32.375 --> 19:33.375
- I m serious.
This place is totally charming,

19:33.375 --> 19:34.625
and the owner is, like,
the nicest woman on the planet.

19:34.625 --> 19:36.959
They could really use
some good publicity.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.041
- I don t know, Jared s all set
to cover the spa.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.208
- Gina, this is why we started
the show in the first place--

19:41.208 --> 19:43.041
to give mom-and-pop businesses
the attention they deserve.

19:43.041 --> 19:45.291
- I m not the one
you have to convince.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.000
Jared wants something
big and shiny to get ratings.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.208
- I know.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.583
- Hang on.

19:51.583 --> 19:53.750
- That was the network.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.583
- Jared, I have Diane
on the phone.

19:55.583 --> 19:57.709
She wants to run
a show idea past you.

19:57.709 --> 19:58.959
I m putting you
on speaker.

19:58.959 --> 20:00.208
I m here with Jared,
Eric, and Judd.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.625
- Hi, guys.

20:01.625 --> 20:02.834
- Diane.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.625
- So I ve got news.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.291
The network is pulling the show
about the people who eat bugs.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.041
- "Ant Eaters"?
I love that show.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.208
- They ve got some slots
that they want to fill,

20:09.208 --> 20:10.625
so they re talking
about doing a special event.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.458
- Bad for bugs,
good for us.

20:12.458 --> 20:15.542
- They re thinking about
doing a live

20:15.542 --> 20:17.667
"Jaunts with Jared" special
next week,

20:17.667 --> 20:19.125
and if it goes well,
we could have a spin-off.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.000
- I don t know.
A live show is tough.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.291
- Not with the right place.

20:23.291 --> 20:25.208
- What, you mean
the Shangri-La?

20:25.208 --> 20:27.583
- No, it s a B & B
called Forest Cove.

20:27.583 --> 20:30.834
It s a little run-down
but charming.

20:30.834 --> 20:32.375
They could really use
some publicity from our show,

20:32.375 --> 20:33.583
and we could even
save their business.

20:33.583 --> 20:34.875
- Run-down?
- I know what you re thinking,

20:34.875 --> 20:37.250
but there s a lot of wonderful
things we could highlight.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.250
- No, it s perfect.

20:39.250 --> 20:40.875
- Really?

20:40.875 --> 20:42.500
- Yeah, stay put.
Get some more pictures.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.125
Get a little bit
more information.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.709
Did you use a fake name?

20:45.709 --> 20:46.625
- I always do.
Jared, we re doing

20:46.625 --> 20:48.041
something amazing
for these people.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.041
- Well, that s what makes
great TV.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.417
Let me have a word
with the network.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.625
I ll let you know
if they bite.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.542
Bye for now.

20:54.542 --> 20:55.792
- We ll get on it
right away.

20:55.792 --> 20:58.125
I ll have Judd
start the paperwork.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.208
- I ll jump right on it.

20:59.208 --> 21:01.166
- Are we really gonna build
a live special

21:01.166 --> 21:01.959
around a quaint little B & B?

21:05.208 --> 21:06.583
- Quaint little run-down
B & B--that s the key.

21:06.583 --> 21:07.917
The network wants
something memorable.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.917
We re gonna make this place
look so bad,

21:10.917 --> 21:13.208
people would rather
sleep in their cars.

21:13.208 --> 21:15.208
- Thank you, Dr. Roberts,

21:15.208 --> 21:18.792
and all of my guests tonight,
for your insightful...

21:18.792 --> 21:21.458
insights.

21:21.458 --> 21:24.083
That s all for tonight,
folks.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.875
Tune in next week

21:30.291 --> 21:32.417
for another episode
of "Gina s Jabber."

21:32.417 --> 21:36.542
- And scene.

21:36.542 --> 21:38.875
Nice work, everyone.

21:38.875 --> 21:40.542
All right, our time is up
for tonight.

21:40.542 --> 21:41.875
No homework this week.

21:41.875 --> 21:44.709
I want our exercise next time
to be completely spontaneous.

21:44.709 --> 21:46.041
All right,
I will see you next time.

21:46.041 --> 21:49.291
Gina, can you stay
for a second?

21:49.291 --> 21:51.542
- Sure.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.083
- Join me.

21:53.083 --> 21:55.792
- What s up, Ben?

21:57.500 --> 21:59.166
- I wanted to talk to you
about your performance.

22:01.583 --> 22:02.917
- Ugh, you hated it.

22:02.917 --> 22:04.750
- No, not at all.
I didn t hate it.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.417
- Well, it didn t feel right.
I was terrible.

22:07.750 --> 22:10.041
Jared was right.

22:10.041 --> 22:12.083
- You weren t bad, really.

22:12.083 --> 22:13.583
I can tell you have
a lot of potential.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.542
And I don t know
who this Jared guy is,

22:16.542 --> 22:19.375
but he s wrong about you.
You have something special.

22:19.375 --> 22:21.041
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.041
You just need to relax
a little, okay?

22:23.041 --> 22:25.208
Just be yourself.
You re coming off a little--

22:25.208 --> 22:26.750
- Like a demented
cheerleader?

22:26.750 --> 22:29.375
Just a little bit.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.917
I think we need to get you
some real-world experience.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.917
- What do you mean?

22:33.917 --> 22:35.542
- What are you doing
tomorrow night?

22:35.542 --> 22:38.250
- Nothing, I guess.

22:38.250 --> 22:41.709
- I have an idea.

22:41.709 --> 22:43.917
I will text you
where and when.

22:43.917 --> 22:45.125
- Sure.

22:45.125 --> 22:47.291
- Just trust me.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.041
- Dr. Burke, how are you?
- Hey, Andy.

22:51.041 --> 22:53.709
- Mom, I m gonna head into town.
Do you need anything?

22:53.709 --> 22:54.959
- Yes, please take
my coffee machine in

22:54.959 --> 22:57.625
and get it fixed.

22:57.625 --> 22:59.291
- Coffee machine s about as old
as I am.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.834
It s a lost cause.

23:01.834 --> 23:03.625
- Well, whatever you might need
to sand and paint those benches.

23:03.625 --> 23:06.041
- Okay.
Anything else?

23:06.041 --> 23:07.458
- Oh, yeah, room three,
it has a crack in the wall.

23:07.458 --> 23:08.917
You know, the last time
you patched one,

23:08.917 --> 23:10.417
you did such a good job
with that spackle.

23:10.417 --> 23:13.125
- That s what I get
for asking.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.458
Yeah, you said it.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.583
Well, you were always
your mother s best employee.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.125
- Just like old times.
Have a good one.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.875
Hey, Brian.

23:19.875 --> 23:20.917
- Hey, Andy.
What are you doing here?

23:20.917 --> 23:22.500
- Did you know my mom s behind
on all her bills?

23:22.500 --> 23:24.917
They re about
to cut the power off.

23:24.917 --> 23:27.583
- I didn t know
it was that bad.

23:27.583 --> 23:38.208
What are you gonna do?
- I don t know.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.709
I just don t see how
she can keep this up.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.834
- I hate to say this,
but have you thought

23:41.834 --> 23:44.208
about selling the place?

23:44.208 --> 23:45.959
- I was hoping it wouldn t
get to that point.

23:45.959 --> 23:47.792
- I know a guy who does
this type of thing.

23:47.792 --> 23:49.417
Let me give you
his card.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.125
- You know it would break
my mom s heart to sell.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.917
- Just meet with the guy,
see what he has to say.

23:52.917 --> 23:54.917
You don t have to decide
just yet.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.250
- All right.
I ll think about it.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.250
- Come on,
I ll get you his card.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.583
- One grilled cheese
with tomato soup.

23:59.583 --> 24:00.917
- Oh, thank you, Tammy.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.917
Tammy, what do people do here?
Are there any activities?

24:03.917 --> 24:06.166
- Lots of hiking trails.

24:06.166 --> 24:08.375
Helen ll pack you a picnic
if you want.

24:08.375 --> 24:09.959
Oh, there s a stream.
Do you fish?

24:17.375 --> 24:18.917
- Only for compliments.

24:18.917 --> 24:22.542
- Well, there s the hayride.
That s fun.

24:22.542 --> 24:25.041
- Oh, hayride.

24:25.041 --> 24:26.375
- How is everything?

24:26.375 --> 24:28.166
- You are an amazing cook.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.750
Is that powdered sugar
on the grilled cheese?

24:29.750 --> 24:31.041
- No one has ever guessed
my secret ingredient before.

24:31.041 --> 24:32.166
Now, as for my secret agenda,

24:32.166 --> 24:33.166
I keep plying you with food,
hoping you ll stay longer.

24:33.166 --> 24:34.709
- Actually, I like it
so much here at Forest Cove,

24:34.709 --> 24:36.250
I was hoping to stay here
instead of moving on to the spa.

24:36.250 --> 24:38.417
- Wonderful.

24:38.417 --> 24:41.208
Getting the crossword.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.750
It s a real lollapalooza
this week, just like you.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.875
- Will you excuse me
for a minute?

24:44.875 --> 24:47.083
Mmm.

24:49.041 --> 24:50.917
- Thought you were gonna be
at your conference all day.

24:50.917 --> 24:52.709
- Well, nothing on the itinerary
jumped out at me.

24:52.709 --> 24:55.959
- Mm?
- Yeah.

24:55.959 --> 24:57.583
- Well, don t they have
some kind of a dinner reception?

24:57.583 --> 25:11.542
- Yeah, but that means
I would miss

25:11.542 --> 25:12.417
your fettuccine puttanesca,
and--

25:13.917 --> 25:15.834
- That would be
unacceptable.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.500
- Mm.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.875
- Look at that poor boy.

25:25.875 --> 25:27.792
You can t create art
when you re confused.

25:27.792 --> 25:30.792
He just needs some inspiration.

25:30.792 --> 25:32.125
A Mona Lisa.

25:32.125 --> 25:34.208
- Ah, so you re meddling.

25:34.208 --> 25:35.125
- It s not meddling
when it s done out of love.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.208
- Careful, it s hot.

25:36.208 --> 25:37.500
- Tammy.
Tammy.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.458
- Oh, sorry.

25:40.458 --> 25:44.166
- There s a hungry artist
in the garden.

25:44.166 --> 25:46.000
- Oh, okay.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.792
- Oh.

25:49.792 --> 25:52.959
- Helen thought
you could use a snack.

25:56.375 --> 25:59.959
- Thank you.
What do you think?

25:59.959 --> 26:01.458
- What s it supposed to be?

26:01.458 --> 26:02.959
- I m trying to get
into art school with this.

26:02.959 --> 26:04.625
I have to come up
with something really special

26:04.625 --> 26:07.959
if I want to get in.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.166
You don t like it,
do you?

26:17.166 --> 26:19.500
- I kind of like things
that look like... things.

26:19.500 --> 26:22.667
- Well, everybody has
their own taste.

26:22.667 --> 26:24.834
- Good luck.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.834
- What do you want,
Jared?

26:27.834 --> 26:28.834
- We found the perfect place
for the special, Lynn.

26:32.041 --> 26:33.333
I m about to drive there now.
You are going to love it.

26:33.333 --> 26:37.250
- So you called me out
of a meeting

26:37.250 --> 26:39.667
to tell me that you re
doing your job.

26:39.667 --> 26:42.583
- Well, I thought
you might want to know

26:49.375 --> 26:52.375
what we re planning
on doing.

26:52.375 --> 26:53.875
- I really don t care.

26:53.875 --> 26:55.792
If you want to impress me,
get me ratings.

26:55.792 --> 26:58.291
- Oh, I will.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.417
- Remember,
it needs to be memorable.

26:59.417 --> 27:00.500
- Understood.
I will not disappoint.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.000
I hope not.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.333
�

27:04.333 --> 27:06.709
- Can t relax
on your vacation?

27:06.709 --> 27:08.041
- Oh, work called.

27:08.041 --> 27:09.709
They want me to work
on, um, work.

27:09.709 --> 27:12.333
- Listen, I want to apologize
for snapping at you earlier.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.959
Just--I worry
about my mom.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.458
- It s okay.
You were being a good son.

27:18.458 --> 27:31.417
But when I met your mother,
I saw one tough cookie.

27:31.417 --> 27:32.583
- So you ve tried
her baking.

27:33.709 --> 27:36.417
- Gina?
Hello, can you hear me?

27:36.417 --> 27:40.083
- Try out front,
by the driveway.

27:40.083 --> 27:42.000
Oh, and raise your arm.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.417
- I m not falling for that.
You just want me to look silly.

27:45.417 --> 27:48.250
Gina?

27:48.250 --> 27:50.709
Gina?

27:50.709 --> 27:53.709
- Now I can hear you.
I ve been calling all morning,

27:53.709 --> 27:56.041
and I can t get through.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.750
- Reception s terrible here.

27:57.750 --> 27:59.583
You should try the hotel phone.
What s up?

27:59.583 --> 28:01.125
- The network approved
Forest Cove for the special.

28:03.834 --> 28:06.750
I think the place is going to
get some great exposure.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.000
Jared wants more pictures.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
- I can t wait to tell
Helen and Andy.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
- You have to wait.
You re still undercover,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.417
so they don t give you
special treatment.

28:15.417 --> 28:16.542
- That s the thing, they give
everyone special treatment here.

28:16.542 --> 28:19.291
We could not have picked
better people to help.

28:19.291 --> 28:21.709
- Oh, and Jared s
coming up

28:21.709 --> 28:23.041
to do a drive-by
to check out the place.

28:23.041 --> 28:24.542
- I know he likes to get
the lay of the land,

28:24.542 --> 28:26.625
but you can t really tell much
from the outside.

28:26.625 --> 28:28.166
- Well, he thinks he s
such a big star

28:28.166 --> 28:30.542
that if he comes in,
everyone will recognize him.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.291
- Of course he does.

28:32.291 --> 28:33.291
- Oh, and he wants
to meet you

28:33.291 --> 28:34.875
at a restaurant nearby
for dinner.

28:34.875 --> 28:36.583
- Just tell me
when Jared s calling Helen.

28:36.583 --> 28:38.000
Andy, I just got off the phone

28:38.000 --> 28:40.208
with Jared Blasco.
He s coming here.

28:40.208 --> 28:42.291
- Uh, never mind.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.500
- "Jaunts with Jared" turned
that little place in Connecticut

28:44.500 --> 28:45.834
into New England s
top bed and breakfast.

28:45.834 --> 28:48.250
This is gonna be just the boost
that we needed.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.375
- Okay, Mom,
let s not get excited.

28:50.375 --> 28:52.625
I mean, they edit these shows
to make it look

28:52.625 --> 28:55.291
like the owner s
incompetent.

28:57.208 --> 28:58.000
- Have you ever seen
that show?

28:59.625 --> 29:01.667
- No, but I ve seen
a lot of reality,

29:01.667 --> 29:04.166
and they take things
out of context,

29:04.166 --> 29:06.625
exaggerate
all the problems,

29:06.625 --> 29:08.500
and we know that Forest Cove
has a lot of problems.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.625
- But not all of these shows
focus on the negatives.

29:10.625 --> 29:11.667
- I ve watched the show,
and that Jared

29:11.667 --> 29:12.875
is a really nice guy--
just the kind of person

29:12.875 --> 29:14.375
who would love it here.
He s really cute too.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.208
- I still think
you should say no.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.667
We can come up
with another plan.

29:17.667 --> 29:19.625
- Andy, this sounds like
an opportunity of a lifetime.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.834
I don t think you can
turn it down.

29:21.834 --> 29:24.458
- There is no such thing
as free advertising.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.041
- But the show is about finding
diamonds in the rough,

29:27.041 --> 29:29.333
so obviously Forest Cove
will come off looking amazing.

29:29.333 --> 29:30.834
- And they ll find
every crack in the wall,

29:30.834 --> 29:32.291
every leaky faucet.

29:32.291 --> 29:34.667
- Hey, I m doing this show,
so you two can stop bickering.

29:34.667 --> 29:36.166
- I think that s
the right choice, Helen.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.750
In fact, I know it is.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.542
- All right, Mom,
if we re gonna do this,

29:39.542 --> 29:41.542
there s a lot of things
that need to be fixed.

29:41.542 --> 29:43.375
- Okay, make a list.

29:43.375 --> 29:44.834
Why don t the two of you
walk around

29:44.834 --> 29:47.917
and see what all
needs to be spruced up.

29:47.917 --> 29:49.333
- Actually, I do want to take
a look around the grounds,

29:49.333 --> 29:51.208
so may I borrow this?

29:51.208 --> 29:52.917
- Yeah.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.375
- Fine, let s go.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.750
- Helen Lochner, if there was
a gold medal for meddling,

29:56.750 --> 29:58.208
it d be the meddling medal.

29:58.208 --> 29:59.875
- My mother doesn t realize
how much stuff

29:59.875 --> 30:01.500
needs to be done
to this place.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.375
I mean, the roof s leaking,
we have to re-paint the walls,

30:03.375 --> 30:05.250
there s patio chairs that are--
- Oh!

30:05.250 --> 30:07.959
It s Forest Cove
for birds!

30:09.875 --> 30:14.083
- One Thanksgiving weekend,
we were all booked up.

30:14.083 --> 30:17.000
This couple needed
a place to stay.

30:19.917 --> 30:21.709
My parents gave them
their room for the night.

30:21.709 --> 30:23.417
The husband was a carpenter.
He built this to thank us.

30:23.417 --> 30:27.583
- That s so sweet.

30:27.583 --> 30:30.083
- Over here,
this was

30:30.083 --> 30:33.083
from the house
my mom grew up in.

30:33.083 --> 30:35.125
- I love that everything here
has a story behind it.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.250
- Except guests don t really see
a wooden bench as an amenity.

30:37.250 --> 30:39.709
That s why we re losing out
to the spa.

30:39.709 --> 30:41.458
- I don t have to leave the city
to sit in a sauna

30:41.458 --> 30:42.750
or get my nails done.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.417
There s so much more here.
There s so much history.

30:44.417 --> 30:47.083
- You really think this show
will give us a good review?

30:52.291 --> 30:54.959
You ever watched it?

30:54.959 --> 30:57.625
- Once or twice.

30:57.625 --> 30:59.625
But I think Forest Cove
will come off

30:59.625 --> 31:01.000
looking
like a hidden treasure.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.667
- Down here, we have a hill that
looks like George Washington.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.709
- Seriously?

31:04.709 --> 31:07.792
- No.
It s just a big rock.

31:07.792 --> 31:09.583
I did see a rock in Ireland that
looked like Napoleon, though.

31:09.583 --> 31:11.959
- Oh, lucky.

31:11.959 --> 31:14.583
I ve always wanted
to vacation there.

31:14.583 --> 31:18.417
- Not a vacation.
I was covering a protest.

31:18.417 --> 31:21.333
- So you re a journalist?

31:21.333 --> 31:22.667
Travel the world and write.
That s very cool.

31:22.667 --> 31:25.667
- And I get to sleep in my bed
ten times out of the year.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.500
- It can be hard to stop work
from consuming your life.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.125
- Someday, I ll take off
and write a book about it.

31:29.125 --> 31:30.834
- I don t even have time
to read one.

31:30.834 --> 31:33.458
I travel a lot for work too.
It can get old.

31:33.458 --> 31:36.583
- What do you do?

31:36.583 --> 31:39.250
- I-I write,

31:39.250 --> 31:41.750
but nothing as exciting
as what you do.

31:41.750 --> 31:45.542
Which reminds me, I should
probably call the office.

31:45.542 --> 31:48.250
- What about the list?

31:48.250 --> 31:50.417
- Can we pick it up later?

31:50.417 --> 31:52.750
- Okay.

31:52.750 --> 31:53.750
- So, tell the crew to get
a shot of this birdhouse

31:53.750 --> 31:56.625
that is the exact replica
of Forest Cove.

31:56.625 --> 31:59.750
Oh, and we need to do
a segment on Helen s cooking.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.542
- So any tennis courts,
a swimming pool,

32:02.542 --> 32:03.834
horseback riding?

32:03.834 --> 32:06.500
- No, but there is a hayride.
I haven t checked that out yet.

32:06.500 --> 32:09.417
- How do you not have time
at a place with nothing to do?

32:11.083 --> 32:13.333
Too busy listening
to 8-track tapes?

32:13.333 --> 32:15.834
- You joke, but you ll see
when you get here.

32:15.834 --> 32:19.250
I can t wait to tell
Helen and Andy who I really am.

32:21.875 --> 32:23.542
Gina?
Gina?

32:23.542 --> 32:26.458
- Oh, hey. What s the name
of that show again?

32:26.458 --> 32:29.291
"Journeys with Jerry?"

32:29.291 --> 32:31.709
- "Jaunts with Jared."

32:31.709 --> 32:33.875
Boy, I like Diane.
She is a real sweetheart.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.875
She s pretty too.

32:35.875 --> 32:39.375
- Okay, can we have
a no-meddling policy

32:39.375 --> 32:42.041
while I m here?

32:49.041 --> 32:50.041
- Wow, those smell
amazing.

32:50.041 --> 32:52.208
- It s the rosemary.
I got it from the garden.

32:52.208 --> 32:54.959
- I grew it myself.

32:54.959 --> 32:55.625
- You do amazing work.

32:59.125 --> 33:01.041
- Oh, it s not work for me.
It s fun.

33:01.041 --> 33:01.917
- It s your passion.

33:11.750 --> 33:12.917
I used to write reviews
of my mom s dinner.

33:12.917 --> 33:14.583
Excuse me.

33:14.583 --> 33:16.000
I ordered my burger medium rare.
It came out well done.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.083
- Oh, I m sorry, Joan.
That was my mistake.

33:17.083 --> 33:18.333
I must ve put in
the wrong order.

33:18.333 --> 33:20.208
- You know, Tammy, is there
a way that we could cook her

33:20.208 --> 33:21.542
another one and throw in
a dessert on the house?

33:21.542 --> 33:23.083
- There absolutely is.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.083
- Thanks.

33:25.083 --> 33:27.875
- I ought to hire you.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.583
That s exactly what
I would ve done.

33:29.583 --> 33:31.083
- I hope I didn t
overstep.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.375
- No, not at all.

33:33.375 --> 33:35.000
I feel guilty that you re
even working.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.667
You should be relaxing
before you leave,

33:36.667 --> 33:39.250
which I hope isn t today.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.417
- You know, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

33:40.417 --> 33:41.417
Um, I wanted
to extend my stay

33:41.417 --> 33:42.709
just so I didn t miss
the big show.

33:42.709 --> 33:43.959
- Heck, yeah.

33:43.959 --> 33:45.542
- Lunchtime.

33:45.542 --> 33:47.959
- Um, hey, I think
I found my new style.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.458
You like it?

33:49.458 --> 33:50.750
- It only matters
if you like it.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.792
- Really, it only matters
if the art school

33:52.792 --> 33:54.625
admissions board likes it.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.125
- Oh, you can t
try to paint

34:01.709 --> 34:05.125
what you think
other people want.

34:05.125 --> 34:08.708
You have to trust
your instincts.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.875
Oh, poor little guy.

34:10.875 --> 34:12.542
- Oh.

34:14.417 --> 34:15.958
Doesn t look too good.

34:15.958 --> 34:17.583
- They re hardy.
I can save em.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.000
- So what do you do,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.291
you know, besides serve food
and save vegetation?

34:21.291 --> 34:22.958
- Studying accounting.

34:24.750 --> 34:28.583
- So you like
crunching numbers?

34:28.583 --> 34:29.917
- Hardly.

34:29.917 --> 34:32.083
- Then why keep torturing
yourself?

34:32.083 --> 34:33.917
- Well, the world needs
accountants.

34:33.917 --> 34:37.291
I only qualify
for waitressing jobs.

34:37.291 --> 34:41.166
There you go, buddy.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.958
All you needed was
some fertilizer and some water.

34:42.958 --> 34:44.875
Hmm.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.250
- How do you know
so much about plants?

34:46.250 --> 34:47.500
- I ve always loved
growing things.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.958
Are you drawing me?

34:53.583 --> 34:57.375
- Um--

34:57.375 --> 34:59.458
You said you liked pictures
or art about things, people.

34:59.458 --> 35:01.917
- It s really good.

35:04.375 --> 35:05.542
You made me look
so happy.

35:05.542 --> 35:07.208
- Yeah.

35:07.208 --> 35:09.208
You re talking
about the plants,

35:13.166 --> 35:14.959
you ve got this light
in your eyes, and it s--

35:16.083 --> 35:19.041
- You sure they re not just red
from all the all-nighters?

35:25.917 --> 35:28.542
Enjoy your lunch.

35:28.542 --> 35:30.083
- Hey, I saw Tammy
with the assortment of goodies.

35:30.083 --> 35:32.250
That your doing?

35:32.250 --> 35:33.709
- Hush, it was--
it s just a picnic.

35:33.709 --> 35:35.000
- Ah.
Now, have you ever thought

35:35.000 --> 35:36.709
about taking up a normal hobby
like, uh, say, knitting?

35:36.709 --> 35:40.542
- What fun would that be?

35:40.542 --> 35:42.834
- Eh.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.375
- Dah-ah-ah.
- Ip!

35:50.750 --> 35:52.625
- Your car s ready,
and you re welcome.

35:52.625 --> 35:55.917
- For what?

35:55.917 --> 35:58.583
- My mom asked me
to wash it for you.

35:58.583 --> 35:59.917
- Well, thank you.

35:59.917 --> 36:02.583
I know how hard it is
to say no to Helen.

36:08.208 --> 36:09.917
- You know, being
my mom s pastry chef

36:14.667 --> 36:17.333
isn t the best use
of your vacation time.

36:18.875 --> 36:21.542
- I love to bake, and I m having
fun trying out new recipes.

36:21.542 --> 36:22.875
It s much cooler than lying
on a beach somewhere.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.166
- That could be considered
baking too.

36:25.166 --> 36:26.375
- You got me there.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.333
Um, so Tammy mentioned
something about a hayride.

36:28.333 --> 36:29.917
- Yeah, I can
make that happen.

36:29.917 --> 36:31.917
Meet me out front
when you re ready.

36:34.750 --> 36:37.125
- Hey, Gina,
sorry to bother you,

36:37.125 --> 36:38.792
but Jared wants all
of Diane s Forest Cove pictures.

36:38.792 --> 36:40.500
- Why?
I sent him the best ones.

36:40.500 --> 36:43.458
- I don t know.
He said he just wants

36:43.458 --> 36:45.291
all of them,
even the bad ones.

36:45.291 --> 36:47.250
He s making a vision board.

36:57.208 --> 36:58.667
- I haven t been on a hayride
since I was a kid.

36:58.667 --> 37:00.291
Am I your only customer?

37:00.291 --> 37:02.333
- Yep, private ride.

37:02.333 --> 37:03.625
And we offer
complimentary refreshments.

37:03.625 --> 37:05.375
Strawberry lemonade?
- How can I resist?

37:05.375 --> 37:06.375
- Figured I d show you
the orange grove.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.208
- It s funny, you don t
strike me as the type of guy

37:14.375 --> 37:16.959
who would drive
a hay truck.

37:18.834 --> 37:21.750
- Usually I don t.

37:21.750 --> 37:24.083
My mom s handyman
used to drive it, but he quit.

37:24.083 --> 37:27.166
Don t worry though.
You re in good hands.

37:27.166 --> 37:29.375
My dad taught me
when I was 12 years old.

37:29.375 --> 37:31.166
These days, I m usually
in helicopters and Humvees.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.667
Here, let me help you up.

37:32.667 --> 37:33.875
Ooh. Okay.

37:33.875 --> 37:35.667
- All right.

37:35.667 --> 37:39.667
All good?

37:39.667 --> 37:42.000
Sit tight.
Here we go.

37:44.166 --> 37:47.875
You all set?

37:47.875 --> 37:51.208
- Yeah.

37:51.208 --> 37:53.875
- All right,
here we go.

37:59.709 --> 38:01.792
♪ ♪

38:01.792 --> 38:04.709
Hold on!
It s gonna get bumpy!

38:06.709 --> 38:09.208
- What?
- It s gonna get bumpy!

38:09.208 --> 38:10.208
Oh! My sweater!

38:10.208 --> 38:11.917
- I am so sorry.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.959
- We can go back
if you want.

38:17.959 --> 38:25.875
We can throw it
in the washing machine--

38:31.125 --> 38:32.834
- No, it s fine.

38:32.834 --> 38:35.834
I spill stuff on myself
all the time.

38:35.834 --> 38:38.417
My friend Gina says
I could use a sippy cup.

38:42.667 --> 38:44.375
I can probably get the stain out
with some club soda.

38:44.375 --> 38:46.667
- Do we have club soda?

38:46.667 --> 38:47.750
- Yeah, I checked.

38:47.750 --> 38:48.750
I was gonna make a pistachio
club soda cake for dinner.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.208
- That is a really unique
dessert.

38:50.208 --> 38:52.417
- They make it
in this little inn

38:52.417 --> 38:53.959
outside of Portland.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.041
- Is that the Coral Breeze Inn,
by chance?

38:58.041 --> 38:59.208
- How did you know that?

38:59.208 --> 39:00.458
- Diane, I know who you are.

39:00.458 --> 39:02.458
- Are you upset?

39:02.458 --> 39:03.959
- No, I just wish we knew
we had a celebrity with us.

39:03.959 --> 39:05.125
- Does your mom know?
- I can t wait to tell her.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.333
- I think it ll be really good
for Forest Cove.

39:06.333 --> 39:09.125
- Of course it will.

39:09.125 --> 39:10.166
You gave us a great review,
Edina.

39:13.208 --> 39:14.500
- Right, Edina.

39:18.125 --> 39:19.709
You were reading
"E-Dining with Edina."

39:19.709 --> 39:22.709
- I was in a cave
in Pakistan

39:22.709 --> 39:24.959
with a CIA guy
who s a big foodie.

39:24.959 --> 39:26.375
I been hooked
ever since.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.041
- Get out.
- Yeah.

39:28.041 --> 39:30.875
- I ve never met
one of my readers before.

39:30.875 --> 39:33.959
- Well, now you have.

39:33.959 --> 39:36.041
Let me show you around.
You want to go for a walk?

39:36.041 --> 39:37.458
- Sure.
- All right.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.583
- So I just did
a drive-by at Forest Cove.

39:39.583 --> 39:40.959
I m meant to be having dinner
with Diane,

39:40.959 --> 39:42.834
so I m heading into town
to look for somewhere decent,

39:42.834 --> 39:44.834
but not optimistic.

39:44.834 --> 39:47.000
- So I m looking
at a Forest Cove picture.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.208
Is this one of the new batch?

39:49.208 --> 39:51.959
- Yeah, Gina sent em over.

39:55.041 --> 39:59.250
Might be able to do
an interview outside.

39:59.250 --> 40:00.709
- Or we can point out how
the window s missing a shutter.

40:00.709 --> 40:02.625
- Yeah, I could probably say,

40:02.625 --> 40:04.917
"I shutter to think
what it s like on the inside."

40:04.917 --> 40:07.000
- Oh, I love that.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.625
You know, then we can--
we can zoom in

40:08.625 --> 40:10.709
on the rusty table or the--

40:10.709 --> 40:12.542
the water stain
by the front desk.

40:12.542 --> 40:15.291
- Yeah, that was
a bit wobbly, wasn t it?

40:15.291 --> 40:17.500
Maybe I can eat some food,

40:17.500 --> 40:19.166
and the plate will slide off
a couple of times.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.208
That d be funny.

40:20.208 --> 40:21.625
- This is gonna be
our best show ever, man.

40:21.625 --> 40:23.917
There are so many things
wrong with this place.

40:23.917 --> 40:25.375
We could do a whole season.

40:27.542 --> 40:28.834
All right, mate.
Talk later.

40:28.834 --> 40:30.583
- Hello?
Jared?

40:30.583 --> 40:31.709
- It s so beautiful here.

40:31.709 --> 40:33.750
- So tell me about your blog.

40:33.750 --> 40:35.250
It s nice to talk
to a fellow writer.

40:35.250 --> 40:36.250
- Ha, we re hardly
in the same league.

40:36.250 --> 40:38.083
I don t have an exciting career
like you,

40:38.083 --> 40:40.333
and I still can t quit
my day job.

40:40.333 --> 40:44.041
- Do you like what you do?

40:47.417 --> 40:50.959
- I used to.

40:50.959 --> 40:53.125
Now it just pays the bills

40:53.125 --> 40:54.750
until I can turn my blog
into an empire.

40:54.750 --> 40:56.959
- What s your
plan of attack?

40:56.959 --> 40:58.542
- I don t know,
uh, cookbooks?

40:58.542 --> 41:00.709
A web series?

41:00.709 --> 41:02.375
My own TV show?

41:02.375 --> 41:03.542
How did you turn writing
into a profession?

41:03.542 --> 41:05.583
- Well, it was rough
at first.

41:05.583 --> 41:08.875
I took on a bunch of awful jobs
and submitted articles.

41:08.875 --> 41:10.875
Eventually, you just got to
make the leap.

41:10.875 --> 41:13.041
- I wish I was
that optimistic.

41:13.041 --> 41:14.709
- It s not easy.

41:14.709 --> 41:16.417
When my dad died, my mom thought
about selling Forest Cove.

41:16.417 --> 41:19.041
She didn t think she could
handle the business side.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.875
I helped her with the financial
stuff until I left for work.

41:20.875 --> 41:24.208
- How could you leave
this place?

41:24.208 --> 41:25.917
It s so wonderful.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.750
- Is that an official
Edina endorsement?

41:27.750 --> 41:29.250
- I can t believe
you busted me.

41:29.250 --> 41:32.959
- Maybe it s because
your nom de plume

41:32.959 --> 41:35.250
is an anagram
for "Diane."

41:35.250 --> 41:37.583
- It s a food blog,
so wouldn t it be

41:37.583 --> 41:39.917
a "nom, nom, nom de plume"?

41:42.625 --> 41:45.583
Oh, that--that was
my favorite accessory.

41:47.458 --> 41:49.417
Oh, wow, reception.
I should take this.

41:49.417 --> 41:51.959
Hey, what s up?

41:51.959 --> 41:54.083
- Jared s done scouting
the location.

41:54.083 --> 41:56.625
He wants to meet you
at a restaurant in town.

42:00.333 --> 42:01.959
Can you be there,
like, now?

42:01.959 --> 42:05.583
- I guess I don t have
a choice.

42:05.583 --> 42:07.375
- I ll text you
the address.

42:07.375 --> 42:09.959
- Hey, I have to get going.

42:11.458 --> 42:12.959
- Yeah, me too.

42:12.959 --> 42:14.792
- Oh.

42:14.792 --> 42:16.583
- Mom, you re gonna
hurt yourself.

42:16.583 --> 42:18.291
- That s--don t fuss.

42:18.291 --> 42:20.500
This is my new coffee machine.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.792
- You could ve fallen
or hurt your back.

42:24.583 --> 42:25.750
I hate to think what you do
when I m not here.

42:27.291 --> 42:29.000
- I m the one that worries
about you.

42:29.000 --> 42:40.458
- All right, well,
let me open this up,

42:40.458 --> 42:41.750
and I ll bring it in to you
in a minute.

42:41.750 --> 42:43.125
- Thank you.

42:43.125 --> 42:44.667
- Tammy, the new coffee machine
is here.

42:44.667 --> 42:46.500
- What s your name?
Okay.

42:46.500 --> 42:48.583
"To Kasey.
Much love, Jared Blasco."

42:51.166 --> 42:53.417
- Thanks for being a fan.

42:53.417 --> 42:54.834
Excuse me.
Could I get bottled?

42:54.834 --> 42:55.667
- I m fine with coffee.
Thank you.

42:55.667 --> 42:56.583
Jared, please don t.

43:02.041 --> 43:04.709
- It s for all your hard work.

43:04.709 --> 43:17.166
You re always saying
that I don t appreciate you, so.

43:17.166 --> 43:19.333
- As long as they re
boss flowers

43:19.333 --> 43:25.583
and not boyfriend flowers.

43:30.041 --> 43:31.625
- Why are you covered
in hay, hmm?

43:31.625 --> 43:32.917
I think you re taking
this undercover thing

43:35.125 --> 43:38.583
a little too seriously,
don t you?

43:38.583 --> 43:39.583
- I was on a hayride.

43:45.041 --> 43:46.458
- Really?
Pulled by really old horses?

43:46.458 --> 43:47.959
- By a really old truck.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.792
- Well, that s great.
We need to put it in the show.

43:50.792 --> 43:51.959
- It was actually
a really nice ride.

43:51.959 --> 43:54.291
- On the way in,
I passed the property.

43:54.291 --> 43:56.917
Beside the fact
that there s no valet,

43:56.917 --> 43:58.208
the outside s not
all that horrible.

43:58.208 --> 43:59.125
- And you have to experience
its charm.

43:59.125 --> 44:02.125
It s like staying
in a nice, snuggly blanket.

44:02.125 --> 44:03.959
People are looking
for a place to unplug.

44:03.959 --> 44:05.709
This place is not
designer furniture,

44:05.709 --> 44:06.542
Jacuzzi tubs, but it s
like staying with family.

44:06.542 --> 44:09.041
- When I stay with family,
I stay at a nice hotel.

44:09.041 --> 44:11.583
- Just give it a chance,
all right?

44:11.583 --> 44:12.917
Why don t you eat dinner
there tonight?

44:12.917 --> 44:14.750
- I would love to have dinner
with you tonight.

44:14.750 --> 44:16.542
There s a five-star restaurant
at the spa.

44:16.542 --> 44:18.917
- You re not getting it.

44:18.917 --> 44:21.083
- Okay,
what do you want from me?

44:21.083 --> 44:23.583
- I want you to give
Forest Cove a fair review.

44:23.583 --> 44:26.417
- Fine, but I m not
gonna lie.

44:26.417 --> 44:28.250
My credibility s
on the line.

44:28.250 --> 44:29.667
- All right.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.583
If everything on this list
is fixed,

44:31.583 --> 44:33.417
then you wouldn t be lying.

44:33.417 --> 44:34.917
- Wiggly banister.
What do you mean?

44:34.917 --> 44:36.083
- I mean, if I fix
everything on this list,

44:36.083 --> 44:37.750
then you ll give Forest Cove
a glowing review.

44:37.750 --> 44:40.166
- I don t think it works--
- Glowing.

44:40.166 --> 44:41.917
- You haven t even
finished your coffee.

44:41.917 --> 44:44.208
- I have to get back.
I have a lot of work to do

44:44.208 --> 44:48.750
at Forest Cove.

44:48.750 --> 44:51.041
- Well, if you have
any questions,

44:51.041 --> 44:53.291
you have my information.

44:53.291 --> 44:56.417
Yep, okay.

44:56.417 --> 44:58.250
Hey, what s up?
I was looking for you earlier.

44:58.250 --> 45:00.208
- Oh, I was in town.

45:00.208 --> 45:02.959
- Not much of a town--
more like a street.

45:05.875 --> 45:07.125
What were you doing?

45:07.125 --> 45:08.542
- I was getting coffee
with a friend

45:08.542 --> 45:10.959
who s passing through.

45:10.959 --> 45:11.750
- You kind of made a face.
Not a friend you like?

45:11.750 --> 45:13.542
- He s an ex.

45:13.542 --> 45:17.417
Anyway, I was thinking
about what you were saying

45:17.417 --> 45:19.625
about reality television
always focusing on the negative,

45:19.625 --> 45:21.291
and I think you re right.

45:21.291 --> 45:22.709
It wouldn t hurt to spruce
things up around here, right?

45:22.709 --> 45:24.083
Do you still have that list?

45:24.083 --> 45:26.375
- I do.

45:26.375 --> 45:27.750
I mean, it s a big list.

45:27.750 --> 45:30.750
I fixed the roof, but everything
else would take months to do.

45:30.750 --> 45:33.333
- How about we just
focus on the things

45:33.333 --> 45:35.375
we can get done
in a day or two?

45:35.375 --> 45:37.792
- Okay, sounds like a plan.

45:39.208 --> 45:43.375
- Hey, Tammy.
Hi.

45:43.375 --> 45:45.041
- Hi.

45:45.041 --> 45:47.959
- Listen, I-I went
down into the town

45:50.458 --> 45:53.125
to get some paints,
and I got this for you.

45:53.125 --> 45:56.500
- Thanks.

45:56.500 --> 45:58.458
I love it.

45:58.458 --> 46:02.000
- You ever think
about studying botany?

46:02.000 --> 46:03.917
- My school has a program,
but I never looked into it.

46:03.917 --> 46:15.500
The thing is, is I ve met
a ton of accountants,

46:15.500 --> 46:17.041
but I ve never met
a botanist.

46:17.041 --> 46:19.542
- You really want to spend
the rest of your life

46:19.542 --> 46:21.583
doing something
you don t enjoy?

46:21.583 --> 46:24.375
- That s why they
call it work, right?

46:24.375 --> 46:28.208
- I think you feel
about plants

46:30.542 --> 46:33.875
the same way that I do
about art.

46:33.875 --> 46:35.333
It s something that
you love so much

46:35.333 --> 46:37.667
that you couldn t imagine
yourself doing

46:37.667 --> 46:41.041
anything else
for the rest of your life.

46:43.041 --> 46:46.208
- I know what
you re saying,

46:46.208 --> 46:47.500
but, I mean, have you looked
at the job market?

46:47.500 --> 46:49.000
It s brutal.
- Okay,

46:49.000 --> 46:50.834
but there are other careers
out there for you

46:50.834 --> 46:52.208
besides accounting.

46:52.208 --> 46:54.041
- There are also
other ways to paint.

46:54.041 --> 46:56.750
- What does that have to do
with what we re talking about?

46:56.750 --> 46:58.917
- Look,
I m just saying that

46:58.917 --> 47:00.959
that sketch you did
was amazing,

47:00.959 --> 47:02.625
and if you painted like that,
I feel like

47:02.625 --> 47:03.917
every gallery in town
would be fighting over you.

47:03.917 --> 47:06.625
- No, they won t.
Real art is edgy.

47:06.625 --> 47:07.917
The art school people are
looking for raw emotions,

47:07.917 --> 47:10.125
not a picture of a pretty girl
holding flowers.

47:10.125 --> 47:12.041
- Well, at least
you think I m pretty.

47:12.041 --> 47:13.792
Thanks for the book.
- Um--

47:13.792 --> 47:16.000
- I just had coffee
with Jared,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.250
and I gave him
a list of every single thing

47:19.250 --> 47:22.041
that s wrong
with Forest Cove,

47:22.041 --> 47:24.417
and I have to fix
everything on that list,

47:24.417 --> 47:26.250
or he s gonna write
a bad review.

47:26.250 --> 47:30.291
- You know we re shooting
in a couple of days.

47:30.291 --> 47:32.875
You ll never get it
all done.

47:32.875 --> 47:37.291
- Andy already started
on repairs.

47:37.291 --> 47:39.000
Maybe we can do it,
together.

47:41.583 --> 47:43.834
- So your Andy is on board
with your plan?

47:47.291 --> 47:49.125
- Yes, he ll help.

47:49.125 --> 47:51.125
- I thought you guys
were butting heads.

47:51.125 --> 47:52.500
- Not anymore.
He s actually... okay.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.000
- Well, if you re saying
he s okay, he must be awesome.

sealed the windows--

48:59.542 --> 49:02.208

49:03.834 --> 49:06.709
Bill turned his sketch
into a painting.

49:06.709 --> 49:09.041
- That is beautiful.
Oh, my gosh.

49:09.041 --> 49:10.667
Maybe we could
hang it up somewhere.

49:10.667 --> 49:12.291
- Oh, that would be great.
Then we could show Bill s work.

49:12.291 --> 49:14.208
- I think we have
some extra frames lying around.

49:14.208 --> 49:17.208
- I cannot believe how much
got done around here today.

49:17.208 --> 49:24.709
It looks so much better.

49:24.709 --> 49:27.542
- Well, Diane doesn t know
when to quit.

49:27.542 --> 49:31.041

about that stain on the wall?

49:31.041 --> 49:32.375
It s gonna look bad on camera--
I would think.

49:32.375 --> 49:34.208
- Well, we d have to paint
the whole hallway.

49:34.208 --> 49:36.500
Otherwise,
it wouldn t match.

49:36.500 --> 49:38.041
- Well, why don t we put
Bill s painting there?

49:38.041 --> 49:40.041
- Great.

49:40.041 --> 49:41.959
So what else is
on the list?

49:41.959 --> 49:44.417
- Sleep,
at least for you.

49:44.417 --> 49:45.875
We ve been at this
since 7:00 a.m.

49:45.875 --> 49:47.583
- No, we have too much to do
before the crew gets here.

49:47.583 --> 49:50.208
- We can t fix everything,
and we don t have the budget

49:50.208 --> 49:53.083
to do all the stuff
that Forest Cove really needs.

49:53.083 --> 49:54.500
- Why don t you two
take a break?

49:54.500 --> 49:56.709
I m making meatloaf
for dinner.

49:56.709 --> 49:58.709
- I can t.
I got to meet a friend in town.

49:58.709 --> 50:00.083
- Oh, what friend?

50:03.083 --> 50:05.375
- Just a work friend.
You don t know him.

50:05.375 --> 50:07.542
- So tell me again

50:07.542 --> 50:08.667
how coffee is going to make me
a better host.

50:08.667 --> 50:11.041
- Okay, your problem
is you are trying too hard.

50:11.041 --> 50:13.709
- Yeah, but I can t be
my normal self.

50:13.709 --> 50:15.417
It s too boring.

50:15.417 --> 50:17.417
Jared radiates energy, and
it seems to be working for him.

50:17.417 --> 50:18.667
- You re not Jared, okay,
you re Gina.

50:18.667 --> 50:20.667
So what works for Jared
might not work for you.

50:20.667 --> 50:21.917
The trick isn t just
to mimic somebody else.

50:21.917 --> 50:24.625
You have to find
your own voice.

50:24.625 --> 50:35.291
How exactly do I do that?

50:35.291 --> 50:36.959
- Go interview that guy.

50:36.959 --> 50:39.959
- What?
No.

50:39.959 --> 50:43.125
- Why not?
It s good practice.

50:43.125 --> 50:44.875
- He ll think I m insane.

50:44.875 --> 50:46.250
- You re taking my class because
you want to interview people.

50:46.250 --> 50:48.959
- Yeah.

50:48.959 --> 50:52.250
- So, go interview him,
but...

50:52.250 --> 50:56.125
be yourself.
Don t be Jared-Gina.

50:56.125 --> 50:59.125
Be Gina-Gina.

50:59.125 --> 51:00.792
$

51:00.792 --> 51:03.000
Excuse me.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.250
Do you have a minute to talk?

51:06.917 --> 51:08.750
- Sure, what s up?

51:08.750 --> 51:10.333
- Uh--

51:10.333 --> 51:12.875
what exactly are you
up to tonight?

51:12.875 --> 51:14.667
- Um, are you offering me
this coffee, or--

51:15.917 --> 51:19.500
- No. Sorry.

51:23.709 --> 51:27.542
I m sorry, I should ve
introduced myself.

51:31.959 --> 51:33.792
I m Gina.

51:33.792 --> 51:36.250
- Dan.
- It s nice to meet you.

51:36.250 --> 51:38.792
- Nice to meet you too.

51:40.667 --> 51:42.458
- Have you ever heard
of "Jaunts with Jared?"

51:42.458 --> 51:44.750
- Is that the one
with the hotel reviews?

51:44.750 --> 51:48.166
- That s the one.
I m a pro--

51:48.166 --> 51:51.333
I m... one of the new hosts
on the show,

51:51.333 --> 51:53.917
and I was just doing
some practice interviews.

51:57.750 --> 51:59.583
- Hey, how exciting.

51:59.583 --> 52:01.750
- Yeah, I was wondering
if, maybe,

52:01.750 --> 52:03.166
I could take a few minutes
of your time to talk to you

52:03.166 --> 52:04.583
about the restaurant
you just came out of?

52:04.583 --> 52:06.000
- Sure.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
I ve never been
interviewed before.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.583
- Oh.

52:11.583 --> 52:14.041
- Mr. Lucas.

52:14.041 --> 52:18.041
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

52:18.041 --> 52:20.041
I m heading to Australia
in a couple days.

52:20.041 --> 52:22.375
- Well, it s a very interesting
proposition.

52:22.375 --> 52:25.250
Hate to lose out.

52:25.250 --> 52:26.667
- Well, I think it s time
to sell Forest Cove.

52:26.667 --> 52:28.667
- Thank you so much
for your time, Dan.

52:28.667 --> 52:30.291
I really appreciate it.
- You re welcome.

52:30.291 --> 52:31.542
- You did it.

52:31.542 --> 52:32.750
- Oh, my gosh,
that felt amazing.

52:41.917 --> 52:43.792
- You were great.
- Thank you.

52:43.792 --> 52:46.125
Thank you so much
for everything.

52:46.125 --> 52:47.917
I get it.

52:47.917 --> 52:49.750
- "Still at Forest Cove.

52:49.750 --> 52:51.250
"Helen s meatloaf
was simple but delicious.

52:51.250 --> 52:54.375
"It wasn t duck meatloaf

52:54.375 --> 52:55.959
"or meatloaf injected
with tomato foam,

52:55.959 --> 52:57.750
"but a plain old loaf
of meat.

53:00.417 --> 53:01.709
"It made me long
for a simpler time in my life,

53:01.709 --> 53:03.083
"when relationships
weren t complicated

53:03.083 --> 53:05.166
"and I was following my dream,
not somebody else s.

53:05.166 --> 53:06.792
"Food doesn t have to be
complex to be good,

53:06.792 --> 53:07.917
and maybe life
doesn t either."

53:14.458 --> 53:17.041
Oh, hi, Dr. Burke.

53:17.041 --> 53:18.542
- Oh, Charles, please.

53:18.542 --> 53:20.875
Okay.

53:20.875 --> 53:24.291
Hey, aren t you supposed to be
at a medical conference?

53:24.291 --> 53:27.291
- Uh--
Can you keep a secret?

53:27.291 --> 53:29.792
- It s actually the one thing
I m very good at.

53:29.792 --> 53:33.834
- There is no medical
conference--never has been.

53:33.834 --> 53:37.750
I just come up here
to see Helen.

53:37.750 --> 53:39.333
- Does she know?
- I don t know.

53:39.333 --> 53:40.667
You know, I drop her hints,

53:40.667 --> 53:42.834
but I m afraid to tell her
how I really feel.

53:42.834 --> 53:44.959
I m afraid it might
ruin our friendship

53:44.959 --> 53:46.667
if she didn t think of me
like that.

53:46.667 --> 53:48.166
- Helen s pretty intuitive.

53:48.166 --> 53:51.875
I think she knows
more than she s letting on.

53:51.875 --> 53:56.208
- You think so?

53:56.208 --> 53:59.625
- I could do
some detective work.

53:59.625 --> 54:02.166
- I can see why Helen
likes you so much.

54:02.166 --> 54:05.417
- I should probably get to bed.
Early morning tomorrow.

54:05.417 --> 54:07.542
- Well, good night, Diane.

54:07.542 --> 54:10.750
- Night, Dr. Burke.

54:10.750 --> 54:12.333
- And thank you.

54:12.333 --> 54:14.875
- You know, I think
we re close to crossing

54:14.875 --> 54:16.917
another item off the list.

54:16.917 --> 54:19.000
- Not until we prime it.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.208
- A girl who knows her primer.
Your ex was a lucky man.

54:20.208 --> 54:22.500
Is he also a fan
of your food blog?

54:22.500 --> 54:24.667
- Actually, he never
knew about it.

54:24.667 --> 54:27.834
I don t really tell anyone.

54:27.834 --> 54:29.333
- Hey, you two.

54:29.333 --> 54:31.667
Why don t you take a break?
You ve been working all morning.

54:31.667 --> 54:33.542
- But there s so much to do,
and the crew comes at 5:00 a.m.

54:36.542 --> 54:38.041
- You should know by now,
my mom does not

54:38.041 --> 54:38.959
take "no"
for an answer.

54:41.083 --> 54:45.875
I guess a lunch break
wouldn t set us back too much.

54:45.875 --> 54:47.291
- All right.

54:47.291 --> 54:48.417
- Leaves, debris,
shutters are hanging off.

54:48.417 --> 54:51.250
Yeah, you might want to lay
some scary music over all this.

54:51.250 --> 54:53.417
- Dude, this is gonna be
so much fun.

54:53.417 --> 54:55.083
Why don t we shoot it to make it
look like a haunted house?

54:55.083 --> 54:57.417
- Oh, that might be
a bit over the top.

54:57.417 --> 54:59.041
I think the carpeting s
frightening enough, mate.

54:59.041 --> 55:00.041
- Oh, one other idea
I wanted to run past you.

55:00.041 --> 55:01.709
I got this from props.

55:01.709 --> 55:04.917
Maybe you could put it
in the kitchen.

55:06.458 --> 55:09.125
Eek!
That s live television.

55:16.583 --> 55:20.583
- Yeah, yeah, that could go
viral on the internet.

55:20.583 --> 55:22.542
We ll call this episode,

55:22.542 --> 55:25.834
"The Chopping Down
of Forest Cove."

55:25.834 --> 55:28.083
Brilliant.

55:28.083 --> 55:29.583
- Uh, what you got here?

55:29.583 --> 55:31.542
- All righty here.

55:31.542 --> 55:34.542
There you go.

55:34.542 --> 55:36.917
- Can I ask
your honest opinion?

55:36.917 --> 55:38.875
- Of course.

55:38.875 --> 55:41.500
- Okay, um,
what do you think

55:41.500 --> 55:43.583
of this
for my next painting?

55:43.583 --> 55:45.250
- You know, I m not an expert
on modern art,

55:45.250 --> 55:47.000
but I m sure it s probably
very good

55:47.000 --> 55:49.500
for the type of thing
it s meant to be.

55:49.500 --> 55:50.667
- I told my parents
that it was supposed to be

55:55.750 --> 55:58.750
a representation
of my inner emotions,

56:00.375 --> 56:01.458
and they said
that I must be confused.

56:01.458 --> 56:03.875
- You re gonna find
the right path.

56:03.875 --> 56:05.000
- Tea?

56:05.000 --> 56:07.917
- Uh--
- Oh. Some?

56:07.917 --> 56:10.291
- No, thanks.
- Yeah, I will.

56:10.291 --> 56:14.000
- You sure?

56:14.000 --> 56:15.750
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

56:15.750 --> 56:17.458
- Thank you, Tammy.

56:17.458 --> 56:19.417
Maybe you just need
some inspiration.

56:19.417 --> 56:21.500
Catching up
on your school work?

56:21.500 --> 56:24.000
- Sorry, just trying to get in
a last-minute cramming session

56:24.000 --> 56:25.792
before my exam tomorrow.

56:25.792 --> 56:26.834
- Well, you get an A-plus
for gardening,

56:26.834 --> 56:28.667
because everything
you planted

56:28.667 --> 56:30.208
in our vegetable garden
is delicious.

56:30.208 --> 56:31.208
- I ve always loved
growing things.

56:31.208 --> 56:32.291
- You could try some
different kind of fruit trees

56:32.291 --> 56:34.041
in our orchard
if you like.

56:34.041 --> 56:36.709
- I wish I had the time.

56:43.166 --> 56:45.166
Between school and work,
I barely have time to sleep.

56:45.166 --> 56:47.917
- Hmm, so no time
for dating, huh?

56:47.917 --> 56:49.625
- I m just not up for going out
and meeting anyone

56:49.625 --> 56:51.083
after a day of accounting
and finance classes.

56:51.083 --> 56:52.333
- How do you feel about art?

56:52.333 --> 56:54.375
- This is a nice compromise--
a working lunch.

56:54.375 --> 56:56.583
- Yeah,
it s a pretty great view.

56:56.583 --> 56:57.917
- My dad always wanted to build
a tree house over there.

56:57.917 --> 56:59.458
We never got around to it.

56:59.458 --> 57:00.875
He taught me to fish
in the river.

57:00.875 --> 57:03.125
Then we found an abandoned
baby squirrel in the barn.

57:03.125 --> 57:05.166
That weekend, we happened
to have a guest that was a vet--

57:05.166 --> 57:06.834
helped us nurse it
back to health.

57:06.834 --> 57:09.166
- I love
all the memories here.

57:09.166 --> 57:10.667
Bella and Marie met here,
Dr. Burke has his stories.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
Maybe Bill will remember this
as the place

57:19.000 --> 57:22.500
that helped him
get into art school.

57:22.500 --> 57:26.333
- I always get so caught up
in the business part

57:26.333 --> 57:28.709
of this place
that I forget

57:28.709 --> 57:30.667
about how much it means
to people.

57:30.667 --> 57:33.750
- I think you ve forgotten
how much it means to you.

57:33.750 --> 57:36.208
- I usually dread
coming back here.

57:36.208 --> 57:38.208
Since you ve been
at Forest Cove, I hate to leave.

57:38.208 --> 57:41.166
- We should get back to work.

57:41.166 --> 57:45.333
- I m Helen Lochner,
owner of Forest Cove.

57:45.333 --> 57:47.208
Hi, I m Helen Lochner, owner
and proprietor of Forest Cove.

57:47.208 --> 57:50.500
Hello, I m Helen Lochner.
Welcome to Forest Cove.

57:50.500 --> 57:52.542
- Forgot to say
you re the owner that time.

57:52.542 --> 57:54.542
- Just exercising my vocal cords
for tomorrow.

57:54.542 --> 57:56.208
- Mm-hmm.

57:56.208 --> 57:58.375
Fess up,
you were rehearsing.

57:58.375 --> 58:00.917
- Now, that would be silly.
- Not really.

58:00.917 --> 58:04.709
I know how much we have
riding on this show.

58:07.667 --> 58:09.208
I just hope you re not
disappointed.

58:09.208 --> 58:24.625
These are cutthroat people,
Mom.

58:24.625 --> 58:30.083
- Honey, this show isn t
like that though.

58:30.083 --> 58:33.834
They don t make fun
of people.

58:35.583 --> 58:40.166
Every business that s ever been
featured on here

58:40.166 --> 58:43.125
has been helped.

58:43.125 --> 58:46.291
We can t buy
that kind of publicity.

58:46.291 --> 58:47.917
You haven t even watched
one episode.

58:47.917 --> 58:49.583
- Okay,
I ll watch one online.

58:49.583 --> 58:52.291
What s the name of it,
"Jaunts with Jed"?

58:52.291 --> 58:53.959
- Jared.

58:56.291 --> 58:58.750
- Jared.

58:58.750 --> 59:00.792
- I took your advice, and
I cut down on the buttermilk.

59:00.792 --> 59:02.542
- And the burner s replaced.

59:02.542 --> 59:05.125
We re almost done
with our list.

59:05.125 --> 59:07.166
- Great.

59:07.166 --> 59:08.291
Now sit down
and enjoy your scone.

59:08.291 --> 59:10.125
Relax for a change.

59:10.125 --> 59:12.125
- Mmm, yes,
so much fluffier.

59:12.125 --> 59:14.375
- Good, now I don t
have to worry

59:14.375 --> 59:16.291
about our older customers
cracking their dentures.

59:16.291 --> 59:17.500
- So you get a lot
of repeat customers, right?

59:17.500 --> 59:19.291
Like Dr. Burke,
he comes back a lot.

59:22.709 --> 59:25.959
- Yeah, yeah,
he s very loyal.

59:25.959 --> 59:27.208
He stayed here a few years ago,
and we really hit it off.

59:27.208 --> 59:29.333
Now he sends me postcards
when he s traveling,

59:29.333 --> 59:31.333
because he knows I can never get
a vacation from this place.

59:31.333 --> 59:35.208
- So he s more than a guest?
He s a friend?

59:35.208 --> 59:37.917
- Yeah.

59:37.917 --> 59:40.750
All right, ask me

59:40.750 --> 59:42.041
what you really want to ask me,
young lady.

59:42.041 --> 59:44.333
- All right, do you see
Dr. Burke as more than a friend?

59:44.333 --> 59:46.333
- You know, he s cute and funny,
and he makes me laugh.

59:46.333 --> 59:49.166
- Helen,

59:49.166 --> 59:51.000
you have spent so much time
finding other people love.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.166
Maybe it s time you started
thinking about yourself.

59:54.166 --> 59:56.333
- Eat your scone.

59:56.333 --> 59:58.709
- "Another day
at Forest Cove.

59:58.709 --> 01:00:00.959
"Not only is the food
made with love,

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.000
but love seems to be
in the air."

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:08.542
- Forest Cove, this is Tammy.
How may I help you?

01:00:08.542 --> 01:00:14.083
- May I speak
to Diane Brown?

01:00:14.083 --> 01:00:16.583
- Oh, may I ask
who s calling?

01:00:16.583 --> 01:00:18.291
- It s her sister.

01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:22.542
- Diane?
It s your sister.

01:00:22.542 --> 01:00:25.875
- Oh, thanks, Tammy.
Hello.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:28.542
- Hey, it s me.
- Oh, hi.

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:34.417
Hey, when are you
coming up?

01:00:34.417 --> 01:00:36.291
- I m supposed to be
driving up tonight.

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:38.959
The rest of the crew s
coming up tomorrow.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:47.000
Just a head s up,
Jared s already on his way.

01:00:51.583 --> 01:00:53.834
- Ugh.
Hey, you should

01:00:53.834 --> 01:00:55.583
come by Forest Cove tonight--
hang out, meet Andy,

01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:57.000
be here to support me
when I tell him the truth.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.750
- About that--you have to pull
the plug on the show.

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.333
- What? Why?
Helen needs this.

01:01:01.333 --> 01:01:04.750
- I overheard Jared
and Eric talking.

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.542
They re planning to trash
Forest Cove.

01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:07.917
- But Andy and I have spent
the last two days fixing it up.

01:01:07.917 --> 01:01:09.375
- It doesn t matter.

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:11.417
They want to make the place
look terrible.

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.417
They re planning to stage things
to get higher ratings.

01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:15.333
- That s not the deal
Jared and I had.

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:18.417
- Maybe not when he was
your boyfriend,

01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:20.500
but your boss Jared is
throwing you under the bus.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.709
- How am I going to tell
Helen and Andy this?

01:01:22.709 --> 01:01:24.542
- You can t.
Figure out a way

01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:26.875
to get them to cancel.

01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:31.417
- Hey, um,

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:32.709
that sketch I gave you--
why did you put that up?

01:01:32.709 --> 01:01:34.709
- Because it s awesome.

01:01:34.709 --> 01:01:38.417
- Uh, that was meant
just for you,

01:01:38.417 --> 01:01:40.041
okay, it s not
for the public.

01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:41.709
- But it s the nicest art
at Forest Cove.

01:01:41.709 --> 01:01:44.458
- It s not art.

01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:46.291
Art is supposed to be
open for interpretation.

01:01:46.291 --> 01:01:47.792
Art says something
about the human condition.

01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:49.458
- And that art says
that the person who did it

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:51.959
has an amazing amount
of talent.

01:02:01.709 --> 01:02:04.458
- Uh, okay.

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:07.583
- Listen,
I took your suggestion.

01:02:07.583 --> 01:02:09.625
I signed up for botany classes
next semester,

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:12.208
and I m gonna start
looking into some internships.

01:02:12.208 --> 01:02:13.625
This is a big deal.

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:15.333
- It is,
and that s really great.

01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:17.417
- You told me that I should
follow my passion,

01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:19.417
but you re trying to copy
someone else s style,

01:02:19.417 --> 01:02:21.583
or what you think
other people want.

01:02:21.583 --> 01:02:23.333
But if art is
true expression,

01:02:23.333 --> 01:02:24.291
maybe you should start
expressing your true self.

01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:31.166
- My true self isn t
gonna get me anywhere.

01:02:31.166 --> 01:02:33.125
I need to find a style
so that I can go to art school.

01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:35.125
- You have found that style,

01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:38.959
and once you realize that,
you re gonna be a lot happier.

01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:44.417
- Ben.

01:02:44.417 --> 01:02:47.041
- Gina, hi.
You re early.

01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:48.709
Class isn t
for another half hour.

01:02:48.709 --> 01:02:51.000
- I know.
I just wanted to swing by

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.709
and let you know
that I can t make class tonight.

01:02:52.709 --> 01:02:54.458
I have an early shoot
tomorrow,

01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:58.500
and I have to drive out
to the location now.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.667
- Well, that s too bad.

01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:04.083
I ll see you next time?

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:07.375
- Absolutely.
I ll be here.

01:03:11.709 --> 01:03:12.375
- Good.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.542
- Thank you for helping me.

01:03:19.542 --> 01:03:22.250
I can t wait to show Jared
what I learned from you.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.750
- Can I give you
a piece of advice?

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:25.500
- Of course.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.875
- I don t think
you should pitch Jared.

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:29.041
- You don t think I m ready?

01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:31.667
- Oh, you re definitely ready,
but in my experience,

01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:33.417
people like Jared
are easily threatened.

01:03:33.417 --> 01:03:34.500
- What do you think
I should do?

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.875
- Just take any opportunities
you can.

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:37.041
- I will.

01:03:38.917 --> 01:03:40.959
Thanks, Ben.

01:03:40.959 --> 01:03:44.458
Yeah, I should...
get going.

01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:45.709
I ll see you soon.

01:03:45.709 --> 01:03:47.583
- Have fun.

01:03:47.583 --> 01:03:49.917
Gina, do you want
to go out sometime?

01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:51.458
- Definitely.

01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:53.750
- Give me a call
when you can.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.375
- I will.

01:03:56.375 --> 01:03:58.583
- Liar, party of one.

01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:02.917
- Diane, how did you know
where I was?

01:04:02.917 --> 01:04:04.458
- We had a deal.

01:04:04.458 --> 01:04:07.250
I fix everything
on that list,

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:10.750
and you write a nice review
on Forest Cove.

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:11.750
- Well, you see, Diane,
I never actually agreed to that.

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:12.875
It s not a show
about fixer uppers.

01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:18.625
- And it s not a show
that destroys a place

01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:20.667
that someone put
their heart and soul into.

01:04:20.667 --> 01:04:22.458
- Drama draws the ratings up.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:25.166
Got to give the fans
what they want.

01:04:34.875 --> 01:04:36.291
- Yeah, well, I m not a fan
of mean-spirited television.

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:37.667
Dr. Burke,
have you seen Andy?

01:04:37.667 --> 01:04:39.166
- No, I ll tell him
you re looking for him though.

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:40.583
Everything okay?

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:42.291
- No, I need to find him.
It s urgent!

01:04:46.041 --> 01:04:47.500
- Forest Cove,
this is Andy.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.125
- Hi, I m trying to get ahold
of Diane McCarthy.

01:04:49.125 --> 01:04:50.625
She s not answering her cell.

01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:52.208
- We don t have anybody here
by that name.

01:04:52.208 --> 01:04:53.709
- Oh, uh, I mean
Diane Brown.

01:04:53.709 --> 01:04:56.375
Right, that s her name.
Tell her Judd called.

01:04:56.375 --> 01:05:07.166
- I can have her call you back.
What s this about?

01:05:07.166 --> 01:05:09.333
- You know what,
just have her call Jared.

01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:10.417
He s been trying
to reach her all day.

01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:11.667
- Jared?
As in "Jaunts with Jared?"

01:05:11.667 --> 01:05:14.333
- Um, who is this?

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:24.709
- Does Diane work
for the show?

01:05:24.709 --> 01:05:28.083
- Uh, never mind, I ll just
try her back on her cell.

01:05:31.166 --> 01:05:32.500
- Andy.
I ve been looking for you.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.917
There s something
I need to tell you.

01:05:33.917 --> 01:05:36.041
- Oh, that the show we re doing
tomorrow is yours?

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:38.041
- I can explain.
- Please.

01:05:38.041 --> 01:05:40.375
- Jared is gonna do a hit piece
on Forest Cove.

01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:41.333
I just found out.
You have to believe me.

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:42.625
- Why would I believe anything
you say, Miss McCarthy?

01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:44.750
- Andy, just listen,
all right?

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.709
You need to pull out
of the show.

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.959
- My mom already
signed a contract,

01:05:48.959 --> 01:05:52.709
because you convinced her that
this would save Forest Cove.

01:05:52.709 --> 01:05:54.709
- I m sorry I got you guys
to believe in this.

01:05:54.709 --> 01:06:09.291
- You know what?
It doesn t matter.

01:06:09.291 --> 01:06:11.208
I had a plan B all along.

01:06:11.208 --> 01:06:13.875
- Plan B, that s perfect.
What is it?

01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:15.667
- I m gonna convince my mother
to sell Forest Cove.

01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:18.875
- What? Why?

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:21.041
- We have a prime piece of land.
This would give my mom

01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:23.125
a nice chunk of change
for retirement.

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:25.417
- No, no, Andy,
you can t do this.

01:06:25.417 --> 01:06:28.000
This will break
your mother s heart.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.083
Forest Cove is her life.

01:06:29.083 --> 01:06:30.208
- My mother cannot run
this place by herself anymore.

01:06:30.208 --> 01:06:31.917
- Andy,
this place is your home.

01:06:31.917 --> 01:06:34.875
It s your childhood.

01:06:37.542 --> 01:06:39.417
It gave you memories
other kids wish they could have.

01:06:39.417 --> 01:06:41.333
- I m sure you can still
get a room at the spa.

01:06:41.333 --> 01:06:42.750
- Hey, you seen Diane?

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:45.333
She was gonna make
some zucchini bread.

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:47.417
- Diane s not available.

01:06:47.417 --> 01:06:49.750
- Oh, well, you re gonna have to
help me with dinner then.

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.041
- Mom, there s something
I got to tell you.

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:54.250
Diane lied to us.

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:56.166
She s a producer of the show,

01:06:56.166 --> 01:06:57.417
and they re gonna ruin us
tomorrow.

01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:58.875
- Diane is
a really good person.

01:06:58.875 --> 01:07:01.083
She wouldn t do
something like that.

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:05.917
- It doesn t matter.

01:07:05.917 --> 01:07:07.417
Besides, she s not
the only one keeping secrets.

01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:10.959
I have somebody who s interested
in buying Forest Cove.

01:07:13.625 --> 01:07:16.500
- You did that
without even talking to me?

01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:24.125
- I was gonna hold off.
The show forced my hand.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:25.917
- Is that why you ve been
doing all these repairs?

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.750
- No. This place needs
a lot of fixing up,

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:31.000
and you can t do it
on your own.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.709
- I understand.

01:07:35.125 --> 01:07:37.125
- You do?

01:07:37.125 --> 01:07:38.667
- Honey,
it s not fair of me

01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:40.583
to ask you to fix things
when you come home.

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:42.166
You work hard
and you need time off.

01:07:42.166 --> 01:07:43.917
Forest Cove was the dream
your father and I had.

01:07:43.917 --> 01:07:45.959
I knew it was never
really yours.

01:07:45.959 --> 01:07:49.834
I kept hoping.

01:07:49.834 --> 01:07:52.500
I haven t taken a vacation
in 30 years.

01:07:54.458 --> 01:07:56.709
Maybe if this show
doesn t work out,

01:07:56.709 --> 01:07:59.834
then it is time to let go.

01:07:59.834 --> 01:08:01.542
- Mom, the show s not
gonna work out.

01:08:01.542 --> 01:08:03.500
You need to find a way
out of your contract

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.166
while there s still time.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.667
- Let me do the show.

01:08:09.667 --> 01:08:10.875
If it turns out badly,
then I ll give you my blessing,

01:08:10.875 --> 01:08:12.333
and you can sell
Forest Cove.

01:08:12.333 --> 01:08:14.291
- Really?

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:17.667
- I m still gonna
do the show.

01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:21.667
I may not have
a good head for business,

01:08:21.667 --> 01:08:23.166
but when I follow my heart,
things tend to work out.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:25.917
I love you, honey.
- I love you too.

01:08:28.291 --> 01:08:31.750
- This is for my room

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:33.875
and all the food
you put on my tab.

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:36.542
- Thank you.

01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:38.875
Where will you go?

01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:40.375
- I have a room at the spa.

01:08:40.375 --> 01:08:41.375
Helen, please don t
do this show.

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:42.875
I could probably get you
out of the contract.

01:08:42.875 --> 01:08:45.834
- I m doing the show.

01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:47.000
I have a good feeling
about this,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.082
and I have faith in you.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.834
You re gonna think
of something.

01:08:50.834 --> 01:08:53.582
- I don t think I can.

01:08:53.582 --> 01:08:57.250
You and Andy trusted me,
and I let you down.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:02.542
- It ll work out.

01:09:02.542 --> 01:09:13.667
- I am very sorry.

01:09:13.667 --> 01:09:16.082
- I ll see you here
tomorrow.

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:18.332
- Hey.

01:09:18.332 --> 01:09:19.417
This place is interesting.
What s good here?

01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:24.000
- The coffee
and the free Wi-Fi.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.082
Thanks for meeting me here.

01:09:27.082 --> 01:09:28.792
I couldn t face Jared
at the spa.

01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:30.417
- For someone who spent
the last few days relaxing,

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:31.542
you look super stressed.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:32.834
- I feel terrible.

01:09:32.834 --> 01:09:35.041
- How d you leave things
with Andy?

01:09:35.041 --> 01:09:36.417
- He hates me.
He thinks

01:09:36.417 --> 01:09:39.125
I m out to ruin Forest Cove,
which he wants to sell anyway.

01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:41.667
I don t know how I m gonna
face him and Helen

01:09:41.667 --> 01:09:42.792
tomorrow
at the shoot.

01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:48.875
- Maybe it s time you
tell people who you really are.

01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:49.917
Stop hiding behind Edina.

01:09:59.875 --> 01:10:01.959
- Wait, Gina, you re right.

01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:05.208
I think I know
how to fix this.

01:10:05.208 --> 01:10:07.834
- This is our lounge.

01:10:07.834 --> 01:10:09.417
We have a lot of antiques
here at Forest Cove.

01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:11.583
I can give em to you
for a really good price,

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:13.792
if you want em.

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:15.750
This one s worthless.

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:17.583
Somebody ruined it.

01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:18.917
- Peanuts?

01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:20.458
- Uh, no, thanks.

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:24.792
- My mom and dad used to put
pretzels in there.

01:10:24.792 --> 01:10:26.041
I had em switch it out
so I could feed the squirrels.

01:10:26.041 --> 01:10:27.667
- Well, the squirrels are
gonna have to find

01:10:27.667 --> 01:10:31.041
somewhere else to find
their food.

01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:34.041
I can write you
a check now.

01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:36.709
D

01:10:39.166 --> 01:10:40.834
Have the office send over
the paperwork in the morning.

01:10:46.959 --> 01:10:49.875
- All right, let me
talk it over with my mom.

01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:55.583
I ll get back to you.
- Thanks.

01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:56.667
- You leaving?

01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:57.959
- Yeah.

01:10:57.959 --> 01:10:59.041
I m thinking maybe this
art thing isn t really for me.

01:10:59.041 --> 01:11:01.333
I thought maybe you could
use these watercolors--

01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:02.667
turn em into postcards
or something.

01:11:02.667 --> 01:11:03.875
Your mom s been so generous,
letting me stay.

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:05.542
I thought it was
the least I could do.

01:11:05.542 --> 01:11:07.500
- You know, my dad taught me
to fish in this river.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.500
- Yeah.
I grew up in an apartment.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.000
Must ve been so much fun
to live in a place like this.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:11.959
- It had its moments.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:15.667
Wow.
These are amazing.

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:17.250
You ever thought this was
what you re meant to do?

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:18.917
- Landscapes?

01:11:18.917 --> 01:11:41.125
- These are spots I loved
when I was growing up.

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:42.208
- Yeah, watercolor
just kind of came to me.

01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:44.458
- You can t run away from
something that s part of you.

01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:46.709
- Andy, this painting s not
really covering that stain.

01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:49.959
They re gonna be here
at 5:00 in the morning.

01:11:49.959 --> 01:11:51.542
Can you fix it?

01:11:51.542 --> 01:11:53.542
- I don t have
the supplies.

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:55.083
Hardware store s
closed already.

01:11:55.083 --> 01:11:57.917
- I could paint a mural.

01:11:57.917 --> 01:12:00.750
- That s a great idea.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.875
- Make sure you sign it
with really big letters,

01:12:02.875 --> 01:12:06.417
so that they can
read your name.

01:12:06.417 --> 01:12:10.667
- Okay, um, I need
to make some coffee.

01:12:10.667 --> 01:12:12.250
Right behind you, kid.

01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:13.583
- You sure you want to go
through with this tomorrow?

01:12:13.583 --> 01:12:16.333
Even if it s a disaster?
- It s not.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:20.917
Diane s gonna
work this out.

01:12:20.917 --> 01:12:23.208
- Who also said
it would be a disaster,

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:27.583
which is probably
the only thing

01:12:27.583 --> 01:12:28.709
that she said to us
that wasn t a lie.

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:32.041
- You had a few secrets going on
there for a while yourself.

01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:33.417
Honey, I saw how well
the two of you got along.

01:12:33.417 --> 01:12:34.583
- That s over.
- Don t judge her so harshly.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.583
- What s the point?
She s going back to her job,

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:37.750
and I leave for Australia
in two days.

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:40.125
- Lot of things can happen
in a day.

01:12:41.542 --> 01:12:44.959
♪ ♪

01:12:44.959 --> 01:12:47.625
- Okay, we ll get set up
in the living room first--

01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:52.750
- Okay, perfect.

01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:55.083
Great, I ll pull
the additional radio mics too.

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:56.375
I think you re gonna need
at least the two extras.

01:12:56.375 --> 01:12:58.959
- Great, okay.

01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:00.125
Exactly, so just
two more shots from here,

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:01.792
and come in around there,
and then right over there too.

01:13:01.792 --> 01:13:05.458
Thank you.

01:13:05.458 --> 01:13:08.375
It s going to be okay.

01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:10.750
- Not if my plan
doesn t work.

01:13:12.959 --> 01:13:14.959
- Team.

01:13:14.959 --> 01:13:16.458
Good morning,
good morning.

01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:25.583
- Morning.
- Morning, Diane.

01:13:25.583 --> 01:13:33.500
- Jared.
- Right.

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.709
Well, this is, uh...

01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:45.417
very nice, very nice,
very nice.

01:13:45.417 --> 01:13:47.333
Oh, dear.

01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:48.709
Very, very good.

01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:50.333
Oh, interesting.

01:13:50.333 --> 01:13:53.542
- Ahem.

01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:56.125
- Look, I m gonna
make it up to you, all right?

01:13:56.125 --> 01:13:57.917
If the special s a success,
we can do a spin-off.

01:13:57.917 --> 01:13:59.250
You ll have
complete control.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:01.291
Gina can even be a host.
I know she s wanted to do that.

01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:04.333
- No deal.

01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:06.542
- I know you ve been
overworked, right,

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.834
so why don t we
just go home

01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:10.000
and start working things out
between us?

01:14:11.834 --> 01:14:15.041
This belongs to you?

01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:17.583
Nice try, pal.

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:22.166
- A fake mouse?

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:26.208
You were gonna fake
a rodent problem?

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:28.166
You re the rat, Jared.

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:30.709
- Jared,
Lynn from the network,

01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:34.542
she s trying to get
ahold of you.

01:14:34.542 --> 01:14:36.667
She says it s urgent.

01:14:36.667 --> 01:14:39.542
- Really?
I didn t get a call.

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:41.542
- There s no cell reception
here.

01:14:41.542 --> 01:14:42.750
- Perfect.

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:44.250
So how do I make
a telephone call in this place?

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:45.375
- Use the telephone.

01:14:45.375 --> 01:14:46.875
- Any decent place
will have reception.

01:14:48.959 --> 01:14:52.458
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:52.458 --> 01:14:55.125
- Would you mind, uh--

01:14:58.291 --> 01:14:59.250
Cheers.

01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:04.083
Lynn.
Hi, how are you?

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.875
- Have you started?

01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:07.333
- No, we re just about
to get started.

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:08.333
I think it s gonna be
memorable,

01:15:08.333 --> 01:15:09.333
like we talked about
in the meeting.

01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:12.125
- So what s this I m hearing
about you giving

01:15:12.125 --> 01:15:13.667
a bad review
to Forest Cove?

01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:15.458
Some blog called
"E-Dining with Edina"

01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:16.834
is in uproar about this,
and we are getting blowback.

01:15:16.834 --> 01:15:19.500
People are calling
the network.

01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:24.000
It s bad publicity.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.834
- What?
How s that even possible?

01:15:25.834 --> 01:15:26.917
- Just do a nice piece
on them, okay?

01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:28.458
And that is an order.

01:15:29.542 --> 01:15:32.458
- Lynn, listen.

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.417
Lynn, Lynn?
Lynn, listen to me.

01:15:38.417 --> 01:15:39.667
This is my show,
all right?

01:15:39.667 --> 01:15:41.000
Look, if we don t, you re just
gonna have an hour of dead air.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.208
- You will do what I am
telling you, Jared,

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:43.709
or you will no longer
have a show.

01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:45.208
Good-bye.

01:15:47.083 --> 01:15:50.083
- What was that all about?

01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:52.417
- Some blogger called Edina,

01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:54.291
she s been contacting
the network,

01:15:54.291 --> 01:15:55.458
getting people riled up.

01:15:55.458 --> 01:15:58.458
Apparently, if we make
this place look bad,

01:15:58.458 --> 01:16:00.458
they re not gonna air us.

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:01.625
I tell you, if I ever
come across that Edina,

01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:03.000
I might do
something dramatic.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.959
- Actually, Jared...

01:16:04.959 --> 01:16:07.166
I m Edina.
- What?

01:16:07.166 --> 01:16:09.583
- My fans have been following
my posts about Forest Cove.

01:16:09.583 --> 01:16:11.500
I ve written
all about Helen s cooking

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.667
and how wonderful everyone s
been to me here.

01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:13.917
- You have fans?

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:15.834
- Edina has fans, and last night
I told them who I really was,

01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:18.417
and that I needed help
saving Forest Cove,

01:16:18.417 --> 01:16:20.667
and then I gave them
the phone number

01:16:20.667 --> 01:16:22.667
to the network executive.

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:24.375
- Jared,
not to interrupt,

01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:27.000
but the director s
ready for you.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.875
- You listen to me,
all right?

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.834
I do not take orders
from the network,

01:16:30.834 --> 01:16:31.750
nor do I take orders
from my girlfriend s food blog!

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:35.875
- Ex-girlfriend.

01:16:35.875 --> 01:16:38.500
- I could get a better job
on a bigger network

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.875
tomorrow morning.

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:41.333
How s an hour of nothing
gonna work out for this place?

01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:42.709
Good luck.

01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:45.166
Excuse me.

01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:48.500
- Okay, Gina,
do you think you can host?

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.542
- Yeah, just give me five
minutes for hair and makeup.

01:16:50.542 --> 01:16:51.875
- Okay.

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:53.542
- I didn t really
like him anyway.

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:54.875
Now I just have to find Helen.

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:56.875
- All right, everybody,
it s time to find Helen!

01:16:56.875 --> 01:16:59.041
Who s Helen?

01:16:59.041 --> 01:17:01.625
- So I read your blog.
Really good stuff.

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:03.834
- No more hiding.

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.709
I have to be
who I really am.

01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:09.542
You showed me that.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.625
- Well, you showed me
a few things as well.

01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:13.208
I talked to my mom
last night.

01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:19.667
She told me that I mattered
more than Forest Cove.

01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:21.542
Forest Cove is my home.

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:27.458
We re not selling.
- What about Australia?

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:29.792
- I don t want to leave.

01:17:29.792 --> 01:17:31.750
I don t want to leave you
either.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.917
- Busted.

01:17:39.917 --> 01:17:43.875
Come on, don t you have
a show to do?

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:44.750
- I think my meddling s
finally paying off.

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:56.750
- Oh, you know
everybody s secrets, huh?

01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:59.834
- Yeah, including yours,
buddy.

01:17:59.834 --> 01:18:01.667
- Hmm?
- I know there s

01:18:01.667 --> 01:18:04.750
no medical conference
this week.

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:06.875
- I just come up here
to see you.

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:11.542
All I do is look for excuses
to come back here,

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:13.917
ever since you and I
first met.

01:18:13.917 --> 01:18:15.709
- No niece s wedding?
- No, I m an only child.

01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:20.792
- No golf tournament?
- I don t like golf.

01:18:20.792 --> 01:18:23.458
- Who makes up stuff
like that?

01:18:25.875 --> 01:18:28.792
- Somebody who s in love.

01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.959
I understand if you don t
feel the same.

01:18:40.959 --> 01:18:42.583
- But I do love you too.

01:18:42.583 --> 01:18:44.375
So what do we do now?

01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:47.125
- Well, I m gonna retire,

01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:49.375
take a trip around the world.
What do you think?

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:51.625
And I d like to have you
next to me,

01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:53.166
if that s not asking
too much--

01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:54.542
like a long honeymoon.

01:18:54.542 --> 01:18:57.250
- Well, that would require
being married first.

01:18:57.250 --> 01:19:00.333
- Is that entirely
out of the question?

01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:04.834
- I think Dr. Burke
just proposed to my mom.

01:19:04.834 --> 01:19:07.542
I didn t know he liked her
like that.

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:10.625
- I might ve known
a little something about it.

01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:13.208
I promise,
no more secrets.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:17.542
- Need a copy of those--

01:19:17.542 --> 01:19:19.333
you know,
for my art school application.

01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:20.834
- It looks amazing.

01:19:24.166 --> 01:19:26.875
I m so proud of you.

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:29.375
- Thanks.
I guess you were right.

01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:31.291
I m not an edgy artist.

01:19:31.291 --> 01:19:33.625
- Well, I bet you make
a better dinner companion.

01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:35.834
- If you let me take you
to dinner to thank you,

01:19:35.834 --> 01:19:38.375
then I guess you could be
the judge of that.

01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:41.083
- I think I would like that.

01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:42.417
- And here we go.
Roll one, scene two, take one.

01:19:42.417 --> 01:19:53.250
- Five, four, three.

01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:56.250
- Welcome
to "Jaunts with Gina."

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:57.667
I m here with Helen Lochner,
the owner of Forest Cove,

01:19:57.667 --> 01:20:00.875
a charming bed and breakfast--
a real hidden gem.

01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:03.041
Can you tell us a little bit
about this mural?

01:20:03.041 --> 01:20:04.875
- Yes, that was done
by a local artist,

01:20:10.542 --> 01:20:12.500
Bill Everston.

01:20:14.333 --> 01:20:16.542
- Since my mom s gonna be
spending

01:20:16.542 --> 01:20:17.542
so much time
with Dr. Burke,

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:18.917
I think we re gonna need
some help running Forest Cove.

01:20:18.917 --> 01:20:20.542
- I might be looking
for a job soon.

01:20:20.542 --> 01:20:23.583
Reality television
is just not my thing.

01:20:23.583 --> 01:20:25.542
Maybe I could live here
and work on my cookbook,

01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:28.417
"Divine Dishes with Diane."

01:20:28.417 --> 01:20:31.625
- I could finally
write my book too.

01:20:31.625 --> 01:20:34.917
- I ll still put you to work.

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:38.208
- So you talked us
into doing the show,

01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:42.250
and you managed
to play matchmaker

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:45.583
with my mom
and Dr. Burke.

01:20:45.583 --> 01:20:49.875
I think we re gonna
have to tell future guests

01:20:49.875 --> 01:20:51.750
there s some meddling
going on.

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:53.709
- It s not meddling
when it s done out of love.

01:20:56.375 --> 01:20:58.250
♪ ♪

01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:59.208
- How did you get
into the B & B business?

01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:02.166
- Well, oh, gosh,
when my husband and I

01:21:02.166 --> 01:21:04.709
moved out of the city,
we bought this land and--

01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:06.667
- So I have an idea.
We make a cookbook

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:09.041
of all the recipes your mom
created for Forest Cove.

01:21:09.041 --> 01:21:12.166
It s "The Forest Cove Cookbook."

01:21:12.166 --> 01:21:14.792
- I would have to agree.

01:21:14.792 --> 01:21:17.125
Yeah, me too.

01:21:17.125 --> 01:21:19.291
So what s your
favorite recipe?

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.542
- Ooh, uh, maybe--

01:21:21.542 --> 01:21:23.333
- Oh, the grilled cheese
sandwich, for sure.
