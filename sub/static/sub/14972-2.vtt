( gasps )

00:05.439 --> 00:08.507
( fighting ensues )

00:08.509 --> 00:09.608
( breathing heavily )

00:09.610 --> 00:10.442
Why are you here?

00:10.444 --> 00:11.510
I don't remember.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.345
You got bit by one of them
and nothing happened.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.513
I have a daughter, Dylan.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.382
That's all I know or care about.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.783
I'm sorry but
we've all lost a lot

00:17.785 --> 00:19.485
while you've been here sleeping.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.119
( snarls )

00:20.121 --> 00:20.786
( startled scream )

00:20.788 --> 00:21.353
Hey!

00:21.355 --> 00:22.021
Is that the Doc?

00:22.023 --> 00:22.688
She's been bit!

00:22.690 --> 00:23.655
She's a vampire.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.524
The world went to shit
a couple years ago.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.593
Some volcano goes
off in Wyoming

00:27.595 --> 00:29.328
and after that people just
started killing each other.

00:29.330 --> 00:29.862
( gun shots )

00:29.864 --> 00:30.996
I'm nothing special.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.264
Well, somebody thought
you were.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.132
She's different!

00:33.134 --> 00:33.899
I told them you existed,

00:33.901 --> 00:35.200
now I'm gonna show
them you do.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.201
( grunts )

00:36.203 --> 00:38.003
( bone snaps )

00:38.005 --> 00:39.972
She's got super powers now.

00:39.974 --> 00:41.507
I will get out of here
and find my daughter

00:41.509 --> 00:43.709
without your permission.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.913
I've seen you here before.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.816
I don't think so.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.551
I'm pretty good with faces.

01:25.553 --> 01:29.221
Names I can't remember
for shit but... faces.

01:32.893 --> 01:33.892

01:40.668 --> 01:44.870

every 100 years or so.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.574
Current winds are expected
to bring the ash cloud westward,

01:48.576 --> 01:49.875
disrupting some-

01:52.947 --> 01:55.581
Vanessa.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.548
What do you know?

01:56.550 --> 02:00.018
We live a couple blocks
from each other.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.888
Mind if I give you a call,
maybe grab a drink?

02:02.890 --> 02:04.723
Let's have it.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.233
See you in a few weeks.

02:15.069 --> 02:15.968
( clears throat )

02:15.970 --> 02:18.237
You didn't answer my question.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.974
I know.

02:24.111 --> 02:26.011

02:33.921 --> 02:36.221
Volcano near
Yellowstone Park.

02:36.223 --> 02:37.489
That's great, honey.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.658
Come on, we have an important
dinner reservation, remember?

02:39.660 --> 02:42.161
I know, I know, I'm coming.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.695
How was the job interview?

05:32.766 --> 05:35.467
Have you seen the skies
today?

05:35.469 --> 05:39.938
( speaks Romanian )

05:48.115 --> 05:50.949
Our time is now.

05:50.951 --> 05:54.586
( speaking Romanian )

05:54.588 --> 05:58.390
The mystery of existence
is not merely in staying alive,

05:58.392 --> 06:01.393
but in finding something
to live for.

06:07.101 --> 06:08.700
A delivery, sir.

06:08.702 --> 06:13.538
There it is, everything you
asked for.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.074
( low growling )

06:21.482 --> 06:26.318
I know... I know
something happened.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.354
I'm sick.

06:29.356 --> 06:32.224
Something's the matter
with me.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.392
I- I've got some sort of-

06:33.394 --> 06:35.727
You are human.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.396
No, no, no, no.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.231
That's not...

06:39.233 --> 06:40.866
No.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.754
A reversion

07:02.756 --> 07:05.757

No, no.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.301

07:16.303 --> 07:18.537
This must be stopped before
it's too late.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.572
Yeah, so... I should go.

08:47.461 --> 08:49.160

Find the source.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.810
Do what you must.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.312
Dead or alive.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.447
( low growl )

09:19.326 --> 09:21.560
Something is coming.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.098
I know.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.601
Honey, that volcano was
100 miles away in Wyoming.

09:29.603 --> 09:30.735
But they said-

09:30.737 --> 09:32.771
Wait. I'm telling you, there's
nothing to worry about.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.807
Ok? What we should be discussing
is your birthday

09:35.809 --> 09:39.110
and getting home for
cake and presents.

09:39.112 --> 09:43.014
I thought we couldn't afford
presents this year.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.182
Well, I just made some
extra cash,

09:44.184 --> 09:47.852
so presents are
back on the menu.

09:47.854 --> 09:51.222
But since it's getting late
I say we go home for cake first

09:51.224 --> 09:55.360
and then tomorrow
I take you shopping

09:55.362 --> 09:58.229
and you pick out something
nice for yourself.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.533
Is that money from
the job interview?

10:01.535 --> 10:03.268
Yeah.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.403
Kinda like a bonus.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.171
Yeah, ok.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.640
Well, I hope you get
this job.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.614
It really looks like black snow.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.115
Yeah, but it's not.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.817
It's just ash
from that volcano.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.719
I know, but it's still pretty.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.754
It's toxic.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.225
Good point.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.294
I wonder how long it's gonna
be like this.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.295
I don't know.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.297
We should probably stay
indoors for a few days,

10:32.299 --> 10:35.600
wait 'til the rain washes
it away.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.969
You think it's like
this everywhere?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.604
We can ask dad if it's like this
in Denver

10:39.606 --> 10:41.172
when we call him tonight.

10:47.948 --> 10:51.850
<i> ( baby crying faintly )</i>

10:56.623 --> 10:59.457

Hey Tommy.

11:17.577 --> 11:18.276
Stay here, Dylan.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.244
Mom, no!

11:19.246 --> 11:19.978
Mom, don't-

11:19.980 --> 11:21.479
Hey Tommy!

11:22.916 --> 11:24.027
Vanessa what the fu..

11:24.028 --> 11:25.139
Mom, stop it!

11:25.140 --> 11:26.251
Find someone your own size
to slap around, ass!

11:26.253 --> 11:27.018
Why don't you mind your
own business?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.319
She's my friend.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.020
Yeah, well your friend
needs to know

11:29.022 --> 11:29.387
when to keep her mouth shut!

11:29.389 --> 11:29.888
Vanessa?

11:29.890 --> 11:30.555
I got this.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.423
Oh, you got this, bitch?

11:31.425 --> 11:32.323
Mom!

11:32.325 --> 11:33.124
What'd you call me?

11:33.126 --> 11:33.925
Bitch.

11:33.927 --> 11:34.592
Mom!

11:34.594 --> 11:35.360
Stop it!

11:35.362 --> 11:36.161
Walk away, Tommy.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.962
No, you walk away.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.864
You like to hit women so much,
why don't you make me?

11:39.866 --> 11:41.966
Mom, stop it!

11:41.968 --> 11:43.735
( groans )

11:43.737 --> 11:44.669
Stop it, mom!

11:44.671 --> 11:47.472
( groaning )

11:47.474 --> 11:48.840
You show your face
in this building again

11:48.842 --> 11:50.742
and I'll put your head
through that wall!

11:50.744 --> 11:51.609
Do you hear me?

11:51.611 --> 11:52.310
Ok, ok, girlfriend.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.011
You got this.

11:53.013 --> 11:56.147
You showed him.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.382
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

11:57.384 --> 11:58.683
Mom, come on, let's go.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.118
Just go.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.256
<i> You broke my goddamn nose!</i>

12:31.184 --> 12:34.119
Sorry about what happened
out there in the hallway.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.087
It's ok.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.557
I understand.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.627
It's a pretty sad-looking cake.

12:42.629 --> 12:46.030
Don't smile, I can see
you want to.

12:46.032 --> 12:49.234
Do. Not. Smile.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.835
Don't do it, missy.

12:50.837 --> 12:51.636
Don't do it.

12:51.638 --> 12:52.604
Don't laugh!

12:52.606 --> 12:53.438
( laughing )

12:53.440 --> 12:54.572
Noooo! I'm warning you,
don't smile!

12:54.574 --> 12:56.207
( giggling )

12:56.209 --> 12:57.575
Don't laugh, don't laugh!

12:57.577 --> 13:06.384

13:06.386 --> 13:07.218
Hey, girl!

13:07.220 --> 13:08.086
( laughing )

13:08.088 --> 13:08.920
Don't laugh! Stop laughing!

13:08.922 --> 13:09.654
I'm not laughing!

13:09.656 --> 13:10.755
Stop it!

13:10.757 --> 13:13.958

13:13.960 --> 13:16.060
That's your dad calling
to wish you a happy birthday.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.662
Yes!

13:17.664 --> 13:19.631
Don't forget to get the
flight info for your trip.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.065
Alright.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.068
Hi dad!

13:24.070 --> 13:25.603
<i> Hey, happy birthday, kiddo!</i>

13:25.605 --> 13:27.405
Thanks!

13:27.406 --> 13:29.206
Did you get the birthday
present I shipped?

13:29.209 --> 13:30.775
No, I didn't.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.310
<i> Sorry.</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:34.379
You're gonna love it when it
gets there, though.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.980
Maybe in a day or so.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.382
Yeah, sure.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.321
I can't wait to come see you
this weekend!

13:43.323 --> 13:46.357
We're gonna have so much
fun!

13:46.359 --> 13:50.461
Yeah, um... about that, honey...
um...

13:50.463 --> 13:52.797
Is everything alright?

13:52.799 --> 13:54.499
Yeah, fine, fine.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.101
<i> I just gotta straighten</i>
<i> some things out.</i>

13:57.103 --> 13:59.470
<i> You know, it's just with</i>
<i> the flights and the...</i>

13:59.472 --> 14:03.107
<i> the volcanic activity and...</i>

14:03.109 --> 14:04.509
<i> can you get your mom for me?</i>

14:04.511 --> 14:06.010
Speaking of activity,

14:06.012 --> 14:09.447
who's purse is that on
the table behind you?

14:09.449 --> 14:10.215
What's that?

14:10.217 --> 14:10.915
The purse!

14:10.917 --> 14:13.251
The pink one.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.587
Oh...

14:15.589 --> 14:18.022
I'll get mom.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.491
Honey...

14:20.493 --> 14:22.961
Gary, if you're ditching your
daughter on her birthday

14:22.963 --> 14:26.130
for some random
hook-up with a skank waitress-

14:26.132 --> 14:28.666
This has nothing
to do with the weekend plans.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.201
It's a safety issue, Vanessa.

14:30.203 --> 14:30.768
Mmmhmm.

14:30.770 --> 14:31.803
Yeah, your safety, Gary.

14:31.805 --> 14:34.005
When I see you next
I'm gonna kick your ass.

15:14.948 --> 15:15.914
Coming.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.649
Hold your horses.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.754
Who's my personal saviour?

15:22.756 --> 15:23.821
How's your face, Susan?

15:23.823 --> 15:25.089
Forget about my face.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.159
This uh, is my way of saying
"thank you".

15:28.161 --> 15:30.161
Does this make me your pimp?

15:30.163 --> 15:33.298
The job's available, comes
with some good perks, too.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.166
Yeah, well I need the money.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.268
I wish you weren't
joking sometimes.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.136
Come on, let's crack this
thing open

15:38.138 --> 15:39.137

15:39.139 --> 15:41.139
Look, I'd love to but
it's Dylan's birthday.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.240
She just had a fight
with her dad

15:42.242 --> 15:44.242
and I'm getting the cake ready.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.644
So after she goes to sleep
I'll knock on your door, ok?

15:46.646 --> 15:49.280
We can deal with your wine
surplus problem.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.548
Ok, sure.

15:50.550 --> 15:54.185
Choose your adorable daughter
over a lush of a best friend.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.353
I'll see you later.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.455

Hello, pretty.

21:30.223 --> 21:32.490
What's your name?

21:32.492 --> 21:37.495
Vanessa Seward, age 30,
says the police report.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.664
It's a criminal file. I-

21:39.666 --> 21:40.464
This is a hospital.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.000
This DB should be
at the coroner.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.670
Coroner's office is swamped
and they can use the extra help.

21:45.672 --> 21:46.671
Swamped?

21:46.673 --> 21:48.639
Yeah, it's been busier
than usual.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.341
With dead bodies?

21:50.343 --> 21:51.709
Uh huh.

21:51.711 --> 21:54.078
What's "busier than usual"?

21:54.080 --> 21:57.348
I'm not supposed to talk
about it.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.517
People acting crazy
is all I know.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.218
Do you have a problem
keeping her?

22:01.220 --> 22:02.420
No.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.387
Good.

22:03.389 --> 22:05.089
I'm done then.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.796
Help me with her.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.246
That's a new one.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.881
What is it?

22:30.883 --> 22:35.886
The lividity is unusual.

22:35.888 --> 22:40.624
The body isn't cooling,
rigour hasn't set in.

22:40.626 --> 22:41.392
What does that mean?

22:41.394 --> 22:42.193
She's still alive?

22:42.195 --> 22:45.363
No, no.

22:45.365 --> 22:51.702
But it doesn't exactly mean
she's dead, either.

22:51.704 --> 22:52.570
I need better toys.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.272
Move her to the fourth
floor lab.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.980
What happened to you?

23:02.982 --> 23:07.084
Why aren't you dying
in the usual way?

23:07.086 --> 23:09.353
( sighs )

23:32.245 --> 23:35.312
All this blood but where are the
wounds?

23:36.582 --> 23:38.315
What the?

23:40.620 --> 23:42.420
Huh.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.029
Let's check your blood work.

24:08.347 --> 24:09.413
Lieutenant.

24:09.415 --> 24:11.015
Hi Zara.

24:11.017 --> 24:14.351
Can I just bug you with
a quick work question?

24:14.353 --> 24:15.686
Sure thing.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.788
I got this female DB.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.392
Early 30's, severe trauma
with some unusual properties.

24:21.394 --> 24:23.727
Lividity, body temperature,
it's all out of whack,

24:23.729 --> 24:25.162
and when I checked her blood

24:25.164 --> 24:27.298
it was acting like
it was still alive.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.033
Alive?

24:29.035 --> 24:30.501
What do you mean?

24:30.503 --> 24:33.003
Mobility, cell activity,
the works.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.441
Grace?

24:37.443 --> 24:38.976
What's going on?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.678
Nothing.

24:40.680 --> 24:44.448
We've just been doing several...
nothing, forget it.

24:44.450 --> 24:45.716
Don't bullshit me.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.918
I know you too well.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.487
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.922
You're the second person
who has said that to me today.

24:51.924 --> 24:54.558
What's going on?

24:54.560 --> 24:57.728
There's an advisory from
the Pentagon that's classified.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.029
Don't make me say any more.

24:59.031 --> 24:59.730
Jesus, Grace.

24:59.732 --> 25:00.898
I'm your sister!

25:00.900 --> 25:02.333
If there's something
I should know-

25:02.335 --> 25:05.202
It's nothing to worry about.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.937
Promise.

25:08.774 --> 25:12.042
Look, just email me her numbers

25:12.044 --> 25:15.346
and anything else you can pull
from the bloodwork.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.814
Sending it over right now.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.416
Don't leave me hanging.

25:19.418 --> 25:22.887
I'll deal with it.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.222
Don't do anything else, ok?

25:25.224 --> 25:30.194
And don't speak to anyone
about this.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.829
I have to go.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.571
<i> ( on television ) The US</i>
<i>Geological Survey has advised us</i>

25:40.573 --> 25:43.240
<i> to pull back to a new</i>
<i> safe zone.</i>

25:43.242 --> 25:45.743
<i> The interesting part is that</i>
<i> it is much further away</i>

25:45.745 --> 25:47.044
<i> from the volcano.</i>

25:47.046 --> 25:50.381
<i> I have Miguel Rodriguez with</i>
<i> us to help us understand why.</i>

25:50.383 --> 25:51.115
Miguel?

25:51.117 --> 25:52.216
Thanks, David.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.984
Um, the reason we're asking
everyone to pull back

25:53.986 --> 25:56.253
to a minimum safe distance is
not because of the volcano

25:56.255 --> 25:57.655
that erupted yesterday.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.089
It's because the whole area

25:59.091 --> 26:02.059
is also a much larger
super volcano, a caldera,

26:02.061 --> 26:03.294
that we worry
might experience

26:03.296 --> 26:06.430
some unusual seismic activity
due to the smaller volcano.

26:06.432 --> 26:07.898
You said "smaller"?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.133
That's correct.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.335
You see, the super volcano
that we're standing above

26:11.337 --> 26:12.836
is actually 100 times larger

26:12.838 --> 26:15.573
than the one that you are
filming currently.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.951
You the one that called
in the zombie?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.118
Ex- excuse me?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.053
Called the base.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.754
Sent over data on a
deceased individual

26:30.756 --> 26:33.791
you have on the premises.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.627
Grace.

26:36.629 --> 26:37.861
Then we're in the right place.

26:37.863 --> 26:38.796
Come with us, please.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.031
Can I finish my lunch?

26:41.033 --> 26:42.866
No, you cannot finish
your lunch.

26:42.868 --> 26:45.970
This is a priority situation.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.671
It really can't wait, ma'am.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.847
What do you mean,
"priority"?

26:56.849 --> 26:58.449
Just take us to the body.

26:58.451 --> 26:59.650
Not until you explain yourself.

26:59.652 --> 27:07.458
Can you please tell her
to explain herself?

27:07.460 --> 27:09.994
There are reports of an
unknown viral outbreak

27:09.996 --> 27:11.895
in some cities.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.864
That's all I'm permitted to say
on the matter.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.199
A virus?

27:15.201 --> 27:17.334
That's right.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.770
But you don't have
any protective gear.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.438
No biohazard suits.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.007
I don't have time for this.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.075
Sergeant.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.111
Help the doctor.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.449
<i> ( on television ) Ok, sorry</i>
<i> about that, folks.</i>

27:32.451 --> 27:36.020
<i> It appears that we have lost</i>
<i> our signal from Yellowstone</i>

27:36.022 --> 27:40.391
<i> and I am getting reports of</i>
<i> another eruption.</i>

27:40.393 --> 27:42.026
<i> Tell you what, we'll take</i>

27:42.028 --> 27:43.560

27:45.264 --> 27:47.731
<i> We'll be right back.</i>

27:55.307 --> 27:57.241
Affirmative.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.210
Roger that, standing by.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.578
What's the latest, ma'am?

28:01.579 --> 28:02.945
Yellowstone went off big time.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.782
It's a goddamn crater now.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.417
Earthquakes in a 1000-mile
radius.

28:06.419 --> 28:08.819
There are two nuclear
plant meltdowns

28:08.821 --> 28:11.121
and the comms are being
disrupted everywhere.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.090
National Guard and regular
army have been deployed

28:13.092 --> 28:14.758
for rescue and recovery.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.460
It's a mess.

28:16.462 --> 28:17.594
Are we being deployed,
major?

28:17.596 --> 28:18.429
Negative.

28:18.431 --> 28:20.397
What are we supposed to do?

28:20.399 --> 28:23.100
Well, the Pacific Northwest
seems safe enough.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.334
The ash cloud from
that volcano is probably

28:24.336 --> 28:27.104
gonna darken the skies
for a little while...

28:27.106 --> 28:29.139
Shouldn't you people be
focused on the emergency?

28:29.141 --> 28:30.307
These are specific orders,
ma'am.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.309
Our buddies are dealing
with the situation outside.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.311
Out.

28:36.615 --> 28:40.017
So what is the actual deal
with Sleeping Beauty?

28:40.019 --> 28:41.952
She's dead.

28:41.954 --> 28:45.656
And not dead at the-
at the same time.

28:45.658 --> 28:48.325
Look, it just feels like
this should wait.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.626
I mean, shouldn't
the RA be outside-

28:49.628 --> 28:50.427
We're under orders,
ma'am.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.762
I'm sure you are,

28:51.763 --> 28:53.096
but given everything that's
happening right now-

28:53.099 --> 28:54.498
Don't question orders.

28:54.499 --> 28:55.898
This operation is being
directed by the folks

28:55.901 --> 28:56.767
at the highest level.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.385
What does that even mean?

28:58.386 --> 29:00.002
The highest level means
exactly what you think it means.

29:01.474 --> 29:03.707
I see. The advisory.

29:05.845 --> 29:06.977
What did you just say?

29:06.979 --> 29:07.978
The advisory.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.647
What's she talking about,
major?

29:10.649 --> 29:12.149
She's talking out of her ass.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.718
Oh, so there isn't an advisory?

29:14.720 --> 29:16.587
That's classified.

29:19.558 --> 29:22.593
There's seriously something
wrong with you, lady.

29:22.595 --> 29:24.228
Prep Sleeping Beauty
for transport.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.162
No, no.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.631
Nobody's prepping anybody
for anything!

29:27.633 --> 29:30.033
Our orders are to transport
her back to base, Doc.

29:30.035 --> 29:31.835
( large explosion )

29:31.837 --> 29:33.403
What the...?

29:33.405 --> 29:34.271
( gun fire outside )

29:34.273 --> 29:35.038
What the hell?

29:35.040 --> 29:35.973
Jesus.

29:35.975 --> 29:41.311
<i> ( gun fire and screaming</i>
<i> outside )</i>

29:41.313 --> 29:42.913
Oh my god!

29:42.915 --> 29:45.415
( gun shots )

29:45.417 --> 29:47.518
We need some help here!

29:47.520 --> 29:48.685
I need that bed!

29:48.687 --> 29:50.587
What do you want us to do,
ma'am?

29:50.589 --> 29:51.555
Ma'am!

29:51.557 --> 29:53.557
Major!

29:53.559 --> 29:54.892
Base, do you copy?

29:54.894 --> 29:56.226
It's street warfare out there.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.728
Anyone!

29:57.730 --> 29:58.896
( screaming )

29:58.898 --> 30:00.631
Jesus!

30:01.901 --> 30:02.766
What the fu-

30:02.768 --> 30:03.767
( screaming )

30:03.769 --> 30:04.935
Hey, hey, hey!

30:04.937 --> 30:06.537
( snarling )

30:06.539 --> 30:08.105
Ma'am, duck!

30:12.378 --> 30:16.413
( gun shots )

30:16.415 --> 30:18.115
( screams )

30:18.117 --> 30:19.249
( gun shots )

30:21.720 --> 30:23.487
What the fu?!

30:24.256 --> 30:25.756
Does this have something
to do with her?

30:25.758 --> 30:27.057
I don't know?

30:27.059 --> 30:27.791
Did you see what she
did to him?

30:27.793 --> 30:28.759
You mentioned the advisory.

30:28.761 --> 30:30.427
I don't know anything!

30:30.429 --> 30:31.628
<i> ( radio ) Blue on blue.</i>

30:31.630 --> 30:32.930
Holy shit!

30:32.932 --> 30:34.398
What's a blue on blue?

30:34.399 --> 30:35.865
It means our guys are being
attacked by fellow soldiers.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.835
Ted, keep your weapon
on Sleeping Beauty.

30:37.837 --> 30:38.702
Copy that.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.137
Ok, ok.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.605
We gotta do something.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.273
We need reinforcements.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.575
About goddamn time.

30:44.577 --> 30:46.210
I'll take uh, Tucker
and Kowalski.

30:46.212 --> 30:49.012
The rest of you remain here
until further notice.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.247
I want Sleeping
Beauty protected

30:50.249 --> 30:52.649
until we get a secure
position and transport.

30:52.651 --> 30:53.183
Clear?

30:53.185 --> 30:54.268
Yeah. Copy.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.352
I'm just gonna go to my office.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.454
You're not leaving!

30:57.456 --> 31:00.524
You're remaining here as
long as that body is here.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.159
You make sure she stays put.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.493
Ma'am.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.096
Don't worry, Doc.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.798
We're gonna keep you safe.

31:34.593 --> 31:37.895
Have you noticed the Doc
hasn't been herself lately?

31:37.897 --> 31:41.064
No, I hadn't.

31:41.066 --> 31:44.635
Yeah, well, it's her birthday
coming up.

31:44.637 --> 31:48.038
I thought maybe we could
do something for her.

31:48.040 --> 31:48.872
That's nice.

31:48.874 --> 31:51.375
How do you remember
this shit?

31:51.377 --> 31:53.076
I don't know, I just do.

31:55.814 --> 31:56.880
( laughs )

31:56.882 --> 31:58.215
Hey, come on now,
it's not like that.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.349
Really?

31:59.351 --> 32:02.019
( alarm sounds )

32:02.021 --> 32:04.922
Where?

32:04.924 --> 32:07.858
Oh, shit.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.927
We lost the last GoPro.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.196
Hey, where are you goin'?

32:13.198 --> 32:14.564
I'm just gonna...

32:14.566 --> 32:16.900
take a walk through
the halls.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.769
Won't be but a minute.

32:18.771 --> 32:19.903
You said that last time.

32:19.905 --> 32:22.406
Yeah, this time I'm telling
you the truth.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.074
That'd be a nice change.

32:27.212 --> 32:33.050
I'm sorry that these experiments
have been disappointing so far.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.619
But believe me,
I have been trying

32:35.621 --> 32:43.760
with everything I can think of
with the resources I have.

32:43.762 --> 32:50.000
I have high hopes for these
latest pregnancies.

32:50.002 --> 32:52.669
But that's...

32:52.671 --> 32:54.504
What of the woman?

32:54.506 --> 32:56.974
What do you mean?

32:56.976 --> 33:03.113
Yes. The one with the abilities
of some kind?

33:03.115 --> 33:07.384
She could be...

33:07.386 --> 33:09.519
very helpful.

33:12.925 --> 33:16.426
<i> ( faint screaming outside )</i>

33:19.932 --> 33:28.338
( speaking Romanian )

33:28.340 --> 33:29.973
I'm sorry, what?

33:29.975 --> 33:32.542
You can use her.

33:32.544 --> 33:36.079
Experiment on her.

33:36.081 --> 33:37.748
Yes. Yes, of course.

33:41.220 --> 33:46.556
Her existence could be
the end of us.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.292
Or our future.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.866
Find her.

33:55.868 --> 33:58.735
Bring her.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.371
As you wish.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.607
Alive.

34:10.716 --> 34:14.551
( hisses )

34:14.553 --> 34:17.254
So what have you
learned from him?

34:33.739 --> 34:38.175
( gasping )

34:38.177 --> 34:45.115
Kill me...
kill me!

34:45.117 --> 34:47.417
( hisses )

35:01.900 --> 35:04.401
Well, we're officially down
to DEFCON 2

35:04.403 --> 35:09.606
level ammo rationing
starting today.

35:09.608 --> 35:13.443
The biggest problem being
bullets for the M4.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.479
Surprise, surprise.

35:19.818 --> 35:22.819
That's it.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.921
What's it?

35:27.960 --> 35:31.795
I can't do this anymore.

35:31.797 --> 35:32.662
Can't do what?

35:32.664 --> 35:34.931
What're you talking about?

35:34.933 --> 35:38.235
It's only a matter of time
before we run out of supplies

35:38.237 --> 35:41.138
or some of those
feeders get in here.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.610
So we get more supplies.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.379
There's tons of stores out
there we haven't scavenged yet.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.518
Hey.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.419
We got a mission.

35:56.421 --> 35:57.521
I don't care how long it takes,

35:57.523 --> 35:59.789
I'm not abandoning my post until
the CO tells me to.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.091
What mission?

36:01.093 --> 36:01.892
What mission?

36:01.894 --> 36:04.194
Sleeping Beauty!

36:06.565 --> 36:10.834
Doc says she thinks she could
be the key to the whole thing.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.603
How are we gonna protect
her if we're dead?

36:16.508 --> 36:18.441
( sighs )

36:18.443 --> 36:21.878
We need a plan.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.480
Well, it sounds like you
already got one.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.949
I do.

36:25.951 --> 36:29.219
Alright, well, bring it on.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.221
I take Smith and Gomez.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.489
Beat it back to the base.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.759
We'll recon with whatever
weapons and ammo we can carry.

36:35.761 --> 36:40.564
Any comms left in this part
of the world are gonna be there.

36:40.566 --> 36:43.833
We'll get you your orders
so you can bug outta here.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.570
The base is 40 miles away.

36:46.572 --> 36:49.973
We can make it.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.908
Look, at least give me a
couple weeks.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.210
I can see if I can get
the rig-

36:53.212 --> 36:54.044
Oh, come on.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.912
Axel, it's a pipe dream.

36:55.914 --> 36:56.746
It's not gonna work.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.014
40 miles!

36:58.016 --> 37:00.850
On foot!

37:00.852 --> 37:05.388
Might as well be 1000
with those things out there.

37:05.390 --> 37:10.860
You got a better idea?

37:10.862 --> 37:12.696
Axel, cover us
from the roof.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.164
When the coast is clear
give us the signal.

37:14.166 --> 37:16.533
What signal?

37:16.535 --> 37:17.634
You don't have to do this, Ted.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.581
Yeah, I do.

37:19.582 --> 37:21.527
If I stay here any longer
I'm gonna take myself out.

37:21.528 --> 37:23.473
Doc, lock the door after
we're gone, seal it tight.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.242
Happy to.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.527
( can drops )

37:44.529 --> 37:45.662
Go time.

37:45.664 --> 37:46.930
Don't lock this door 'til
we're clear.

37:46.932 --> 37:47.731
Mind your six.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.232
Go.

38:30.676 --> 38:31.841
( growling )

38:31.843 --> 38:34.077
( gunfire )

38:34.479 --> 38:35.278
Oh shit.

38:35.947 --> 38:41.184
( gunfire )

38:41.186 --> 38:42.952
( gasps )

38:42.954 --> 38:45.989
( snarling )

38:49.861 --> 38:51.328
Keep it open!

38:52.664 --> 38:53.496
What are you doing?

38:53.498 --> 38:54.464
What are you doing?!

38:54.466 --> 38:55.131
No!

38:55.133 --> 38:55.999
No!

38:56.001 --> 38:57.701
Doc!

38:57.703 --> 38:59.836
( growling )

38:59.838 --> 39:01.538
( Doc screams )

39:01.540 --> 39:07.344
( cries out in agony )

39:07.346 --> 39:08.178
You ok?

39:08.180 --> 39:08.912
No!

39:08.914 --> 39:10.513
I've been bit!

39:10.515 --> 39:14.117
( gasping )

39:14.119 --> 39:16.586
( growling outside )

39:22.027 --> 39:22.959
You're gonna be ok.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.627
I doubt it.

39:24.629 --> 39:28.765
( gasping and sobbing )

39:36.975 --> 39:38.775
Oh, God.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.044
Oh, God.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.682
One... two... three...

39:45.684 --> 39:48.818
( groaning in pain )

39:48.820 --> 39:54.991
( sobbing )

39:54.993 --> 40:05.034
( wailing )

40:05.036 --> 40:14.778
( wailing )

40:14.780 --> 40:16.946
You're gonna shoot me,
aren't you?

40:16.948 --> 40:19.182
You made me promise if
you ever got bit, Doc.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.884
I don't want-

40:20.886 --> 40:21.818
I changed my mind.

40:21.820 --> 40:22.485
We made a pact.

40:22.487 --> 40:23.219
I know.

40:23.221 --> 40:25.522
Please, please.

40:25.524 --> 40:26.256
Please don't shoot-

40:26.258 --> 40:27.624
( cocks gun )

40:27.626 --> 40:28.892
( shrieks )

40:28.894 --> 40:31.060
Please, no, no!

40:31.062 --> 40:33.029
Please...

40:33.031 --> 40:35.498
( sobbing )

40:35.500 --> 40:36.266
Please...

40:36.268 --> 40:38.301
You don't have to do...

40:38.303 --> 40:41.671
( wailing )

40:41.673 --> 40:44.874
You don't have to do this...

40:44.876 --> 40:47.043
You don't have to...

40:47.045 --> 40:47.877
do this...

40:47.879 --> 40:49.345
No, I don't.

40:49.347 --> 40:50.413
Come here, come here,
come here.

40:50.415 --> 40:52.515
( gasping )

40:52.517 --> 40:53.783
I got ya.

40:53.785 --> 40:54.884
Come on, Doc.

40:54.886 --> 40:55.952
I got ya.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.888
I got ya.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.323
Stay with me.

41:00.325 --> 41:01.491
Listen to me.

41:01.493 --> 41:05.228
You saved both of us when
you got that door shut, ok?

41:05.230 --> 41:06.529
You saved my life.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.765
( gasping )

41:08.767 --> 41:09.632
It hurts...

41:09.634 --> 41:11.768
I know. I know.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.436
Just hang in there.

41:13.438 --> 41:14.704
Don't leave me.

41:14.706 --> 41:15.572
Hey, I ain't leaving.

41:15.574 --> 41:16.840
Please.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.775
I ain't going nowhere.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.577
There's gotta be a way
to fix this thing, right?

41:20.579 --> 41:22.078
There's gotta be.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.780
We just don't know
what it is yet,

41:23.782 --> 41:26.649
so I'm gonna keep you safe
until we can figure it out.

41:40.765 --> 41:42.732
