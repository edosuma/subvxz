You're a good girl, Elsie.

11:34.797 --> 11:38.176
- Oh, she's the best.
- And you're a service dog.

11:38.217 --> 11:41.429
Casey needs you,
so what are you doing here?

11:47.060 --> 11:49.145
Hey, Ma.

11:49.228 --> 11:50.647
This is Detective
Frost's mother, Camille.

11:50.688 --> 11:52.982
Oh. Nice to meet you.
I'm Angela.

11:53.024 --> 11:54.150
Hi. Pleasure.

11:54.192 --> 11:56.986
- You okay waiting here?
- Yes, yes.

11:57.070 --> 11:58.404
And thank you so much
for taking us around.

11:58.446 --> 12:01.282
- Sure. See ya, Ma.
- Bye, babe.

12:01.366 --> 12:03.534
What a nice man.

12:03.576 --> 12:06.537
He drove me and my roommate
and her son all over Boston

12:06.579 --> 12:08.414
while we were waiting for Barry.

12:08.456 --> 12:09.666
Yeah, he's a good kid.

12:09.707 --> 12:13.169
And, uh, your son and my
daughter, Jane, are like this.

12:13.211 --> 12:15.129
Oh.

12:15.164 --> 12:18.007
I wish I lived closer.
I feel like I never see him.

12:18.049 --> 12:21.552
- You live in, uh, Virginia, right?
- Norfolk.

12:21.594 --> 12:23.972
I teach at one of the
military universities there.

12:24.013 --> 12:25.765
Nice. What do you teach?

12:25.807 --> 12:27.433
- Civil engineering.
- Wow.

12:27.475 --> 12:30.645
Well, now we know where, uh,
Detective Frost gets his brains.

12:30.687 --> 12:33.523
His father was actually
pretty smart, too.

12:35.275 --> 12:37.652
Uh, we divorced 20 years ago.

12:37.694 --> 12:39.946
[ chuckles ]
I just got divorced.

12:39.981 --> 12:42.574
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- I'm not.

12:42.615 --> 12:46.619
Well, anymore.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

12:46.654 --> 12:47.745
Oh, no, thank you.

12:47.787 --> 12:50.832
I think I already had
enough on the way here.

12:50.867 --> 12:53.585
I'm actually trying to work up the nerve

12:53.626 --> 12:56.462
to tell Barry that
I'm getting remarried.

12:56.497 --> 13:00.550
Oh. Congratulations.
Why is that making you nervous?

13:00.633 --> 13:02.802
The divorce was hard on him.

13:02.844 --> 13:05.513
And I never dated.
Well, don't get me wrong.

13:05.548 --> 13:07.265
Barry is very respectful,

13:07.307 --> 13:10.518
but knowing him, you know,
he has strong opinions.

13:10.553 --> 13:14.480
Well, we did bring them
up to have their own minds.

13:14.522 --> 13:16.733
Yes, we did.
[ chuckles ]

13:16.768 --> 13:20.528
It's crazy how the
tables turn, isn't it?

13:20.570 --> 13:22.697
I was seeing this guy for a while,

13:22.739 --> 13:26.200
and, uh, my kids went nuts.

13:26.242 --> 13:29.078
- What'd you do?
- Felt guilty.

13:29.120 --> 13:33.082
But then I decided I was
allowed to be a person, too.

13:33.117 --> 13:36.878
- Yes, you are.
- Excuse me.

13:44.802 --> 13:47.889
I think you need to complain
about your lunch order.

13:47.924 --> 13:48.890
There's a phone in it.

13:48.932 --> 13:50.433
Rice is an effective desiccant.

13:50.475 --> 13:53.978
Are you using three-syllable words
because your mother's in town?

13:54.020 --> 13:56.606
Oh, man. I might be.

13:56.648 --> 13:58.274
[ chuckles ]
Can you make it work?

13:58.309 --> 13:59.734
I'm not sure.
Circuits are wet.

13:59.776 --> 14:01.694
But I've been having
fun on Enzo's laptop.

14:01.736 --> 14:04.697
He liked three things.

14:04.739 --> 14:09.452
Let me guess ... women,
cakes, and BCU football.

14:09.487 --> 14:11.246
What a life ... football,
women, and cake.

14:11.287 --> 14:15.917
Enzo was a season-ticket holder.
And he also had every BCU game

14:15.959 --> 14:18.127
from the last 10 years
on his hard drive.

14:18.169 --> 14:20.296
- That's a serious fan.
- Dude was hardcore.

14:20.331 --> 14:21.756
He watched every game
and a lot of replays.

14:21.798 --> 14:23.800
Pretty sure viewing football
on his computer didn't kill him.

14:23.841 --> 14:25.843
Yeah, and I remember him
to be quite the ladies' man.

14:25.885 --> 14:27.220
What about the women in his life?

14:31.182 --> 14:34.185
Ho-ho-ho!
Nice assortment of desserts.

14:34.352 --> 14:37.480
- I meant the cupcakes.
- Yeah, sure you did.

14:37.522 --> 14:40.316
- Most of them are his old girlfriends.
- He hired his old flames?

14:40.358 --> 14:43.236
Which flavor
would you choose, Korsak?

14:43.278 --> 14:46.364
- Chocolate? Vanilla?
- So many cupcakes, so little time.

14:46.399 --> 14:48.408
Okay, I'm about to
file a harassment claim.

14:48.449 --> 14:51.786
- It has to be hostile and offensive.
- Keep talking.

14:51.828 --> 14:55.373
Enzo updated his schedule
on this internal calendar.

14:55.408 --> 14:59.544
Well, he posted he was going
to the car-wash fundraiser.

14:59.586 --> 15:01.963
- Who had access to that calendar?
- Just his employees.

15:02.005 --> 15:04.299
You mean just his ex-girlfriends?

15:04.340 --> 15:05.341
Huh.

15:05.383 --> 15:07.385
Check this out.

15:09.637 --> 15:12.599
Hmm. "What I'd like
to do to my ex-boyfriend."

15:12.640 --> 15:15.476
- Where'd you find that photo?
- She posted it on candidgram.

15:15.518 --> 15:17.687
She posted selfies all day long.

15:17.729 --> 15:19.063
Okay, who's Laura Stephens?

15:19.105 --> 15:20.982
She looks like an employee.
I'll check.

15:21.899 --> 15:25.028
She's 24. She's a cake
decorator at End Zone Cakes.

15:25.111 --> 15:26.779
All right, well, come on.

15:26.814 --> 15:29.782
Maura's mad at me,
so let's give her a cheap thrill,

15:29.824 --> 15:32.035
and she can comparison-test
the cake knives.

15:32.076 --> 15:36.623
Uh...
meet me at the elevator.

15:36.664 --> 15:39.250
What's up?

15:39.292 --> 15:41.169
You know how I drove Frost's
mom and her roommate around?

15:41.210 --> 15:42.462
Yeah.

15:42.503 --> 15:45.882
Well, I think they're, uh...
you know.

15:45.924 --> 15:48.468
- No, I don't know.
- I think they're a couple.

15:48.551 --> 15:51.137
What?!
Does Frost know?

15:53.264 --> 15:54.223
Never mind.
Don't answer that.

15:54.265 --> 15:55.224
It ...
it's none of our business.

15:55.266 --> 15:57.977
No way he knows. She was
married ... to his father.

15:58.012 --> 15:59.604
Well, what makes you
think they're a couple?

15:59.646 --> 16:03.775
- Jane, they're a couple.
- It's not of our business.

16:03.810 --> 16:05.610
What's none of your business?

16:12.220 --> 16:15.140
We were...
just talking about Ma. 

16:15.181 --> 16:17.058
It sounded like you were
talking about her love life.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.477
No. Menopause.

16:19.519 --> 16:23.565
- We were talking about menopause.
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

16:23.606 --> 16:28.486
It's none of our business
if Ma's in menopause. See ya.

16:28.528 --> 16:31.656
- Ugh. You ready?
- Yes.

16:31.698 --> 16:34.367
We should... get Maura and go.

16:44.044 --> 16:47.255
- Boston homicide.
- What are you doing about Enzo?

16:47.297 --> 16:49.674
- What's your name?
- Valentina Smith.

16:49.716 --> 16:54.220
How could you let this happen?
Car washes are supposed to be safe!

16:54.262 --> 16:57.098
Uh, what was
your relationship to him?

16:57.140 --> 17:00.894
We went to college together.
I'm his office manager.

17:00.929 --> 17:03.563
- Were you two involved?
- In college.

17:03.598 --> 17:05.898
We haven't slept together in years.

17:05.934 --> 17:09.277
- And where were you this morning?
- Delivering a wedding cake.

17:09.319 --> 17:13.073
- We'll need to verify that.
- Whatever.

17:13.114 --> 17:17.827
- I'm not about to kill my boss.
- We'd like to talk to Laura Stephens.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.454
Everybody here was his friend.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.749
We're working on a cake for
his memorial service now.

17:26.752 --> 17:30.548
They're making the Boston Cambridge
University football stadium.

17:30.590 --> 17:32.509
Oh, look! It's a little Enzo.

17:32.550 --> 17:35.011
And this is a representation of heaven.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.305
And I think that that golden ladder

17:37.347 --> 17:39.140
- is so he can ascend.
- Uh, Dr. Isles?

17:39.182 --> 17:42.894
- The comparison test?
- Oh, yes, of course.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.983
Damn, Enzo liked them in all
shapes, sizes, and colors.

17:49.025 --> 17:53.279
- Is that harassment?
- Possibly, yes.

17:53.321 --> 17:58.118
You'll interfere with my
process if you come any closer.

17:58.159 --> 18:00.286
We'd like to talk to
you about Enzo Womack.

18:00.328 --> 18:02.247
Can you just wait a sec?

18:02.288 --> 18:03.790
Crap, you made me bump
the chin strap.

18:03.825 --> 18:06.418
- Are these your knives?
- Don't touch them.

18:06.453 --> 18:09.421
I'll need a clay impression
for a comparison test.

18:09.462 --> 18:11.297
I didn't kill him, all right?

18:11.339 --> 18:13.550
A woman definitely killed
that bastard, though.

18:13.591 --> 18:14.843
How do you know
a woman killed him?

18:14.926 --> 18:16.469
You think you can sleep with a girl,

18:16.504 --> 18:19.514
buy her brunch, whisper
sweet bullshit in her ear,

18:19.556 --> 18:22.058
and then say,
"let's be friends, 'kay?"

18:22.100 --> 18:24.394
You think you can do that
over and over?

18:24.436 --> 18:26.104
We found this photo
you posted, Laura.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.733
- It was a joke.
- It doesn't seem that funny to me.

18:29.774 --> 18:30.775
Maura: Me neither.

18:30.810 --> 18:35.321
- That looks pretty sharp.
- It's a flower pin.

18:36.006 --> 18:39.167
You should talk to everybody.
Enzo strung us all along.

18:39.209 --> 18:40.502
"Let's be friends, 'kay?"

18:40.537 --> 18:42.713
- No, not okay.
- So, why'd you work for him?

18:42.796 --> 18:46.341
Do you know how hard it is to
find a decent job in this economy?

18:46.376 --> 18:51.555
- I have a major in gender studies.
- Ooh. Yeah, I know what you mean.

18:53.807 --> 18:56.059
Well, it seems to me that Enzo gave
you a reason to kill him, Laura.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.561
He did, but I didn't.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.022
I was at the gym.
You can check.

19:00.063 --> 19:02.983
They take a picture when
they swipe it. I want it back.

19:03.025 --> 19:04.902
I have to work out later today.

19:10.365 --> 19:13.493
It's a shame that
Laura has a solid alibi.

19:13.535 --> 19:17.080
Still, I think Enzo was
playing a dangerous game.

19:17.122 --> 19:20.375
You think, uh, too many notches
on the bedpost got him killed?

19:20.417 --> 19:21.919
[ cellphone vibrates ]
Maybe.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.338
Okay, Maura's finished
testing all the knives.

19:24.379 --> 19:26.548
Our murder weapon
is not at that bakery.

19:26.583 --> 19:30.219
So, it's nice that
Robin came with your mom,

19:30.260 --> 19:31.762
you know, so she could
have some company.

19:31.797 --> 19:35.599
My mom's really independent,
but, yeah, I guess.

19:35.634 --> 19:36.934
How do they know each other?

19:36.975 --> 19:39.561
They're both professors at the
naval university in Norfolk.

19:39.603 --> 19:41.396
I didn't know
your mom was a professor.

19:41.438 --> 19:43.190
My mom was in one of the first classes

19:43.232 --> 19:44.900
at the naval academy
that allowed women.

19:44.942 --> 19:47.152
- Are you kidding me?
- She's amazing.

19:47.236 --> 19:48.612
She and my dad
were midshipmen together.

19:48.695 --> 19:51.281
That's how they met.
He had the career she should have.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.449
Huh.

19:52.532 --> 19:55.202
And they're roommates,
y-your mom and Robin?

19:55.244 --> 19:58.163
After Robin's divorce,
they decided to share expenses.

19:58.205 --> 20:00.123
Professors don't make that much.

20:00.165 --> 20:04.002
Well, it's good they have each other.
I mean to ... to share expenses.

20:04.044 --> 20:06.380
- No kidding.
- Come on. Let's call it a day.

20:06.421 --> 20:08.944
We got two games left in the
season, and if we don't get

20:08.945 --> 20:11.468
in a practice today, the drug
unit's gonna kick our ass.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.679
Mnh-mnh.
Since you put it that way...

20:13.714 --> 20:15.847
You think it's okay if...
if I bring my mom?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.766
Oh, and ... and Robin
and Cameron, too?

20:17.808 --> 20:21.270
- Sure.
- Yeah.

20:21.311 --> 20:22.437
[ elevator bell dings ]

20:22.479 --> 20:26.775
[ indistinct conversation ]

20:30.988 --> 20:33.031
- Maura.
- Jane.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.952
Can't believe you weren't
gonna tell us about practice.

20:37.035 --> 20:39.329
[ sighs ] Okay... look,

20:39.371 --> 20:41.540
there are only two more
games left in the season,

20:41.575 --> 20:43.834
and ... and we'll be disqualified.
You're not part of homicide.

20:43.917 --> 20:48.380
Oh, so Frost's mom
is part of homicide?

20:48.415 --> 20:50.090
Jane, we could buck up
sides and have a scrimmage.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.758
Buck up?
Who are you, opie?

20:51.800 --> 20:53.677
- Who's opie?
- Shh. Honey.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.762
Maura, you ... you don't have
enough players for a team.

20:55.804 --> 20:58.223
Oh, we'd be happy to
play for Maura's team.

20:58.307 --> 20:59.933
Robin: Yeah. Why not?

20:59.975 --> 21:02.561
We're just a couple of old ladies
looking for some exercise.

21:02.603 --> 21:03.604
<i>Maura: All right.</i>

21:05.230 --> 21:07.482
All right. So, you're
gonna have to buck up, Jane.

21:09.943 --> 21:12.654
I'd love to.

21:14.630 --> 21:17.674
It's only fair that the
winners buy the losers drinks. 

21:17.675 --> 21:20.719
Korsak got to take Cameron
to buy an ice cream.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.429
We got to endure this?

21:22.470 --> 21:25.348
- Lab results, Dr. Isles.
- Thank you.

21:25.390 --> 21:28.018
All the identifiable organic substances

21:28.059 --> 21:30.103
in the van were glucose-based
confectioner's compounds.

21:30.138 --> 21:33.815
- Swell.
- And blood and glycerin from the soap.

21:33.857 --> 21:36.526
- Double swell.
- There was one exception.

21:36.568 --> 21:40.530
The blue substance that you found on
the rear floor mat is bulk field paint.

21:40.572 --> 21:44.326
Field paint?
BCU's colors are blue and...

21:44.367 --> 21:47.662
Susie, can you check and see
if that field paint is from BCU?

21:47.704 --> 21:48.872
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

21:48.907 --> 21:50.790
Hmm.

21:50.832 --> 21:56.254
Oh, just two old ladies
in need of some exercise.

21:56.296 --> 21:59.049
Mmm.
I think somebody lied.

21:59.084 --> 22:02.135
It wasn't a lie.
We are old ladies.

22:02.177 --> 22:05.722
- And we needed exercise.
- It was such an exciting game.

22:05.764 --> 22:09.100
- 6:1. We trounced you.
- "We"?

22:09.142 --> 22:13.188
Camille hit two home runs,
and Robin hit a grand slam.

22:13.230 --> 22:15.607
So 2 for you,
4 for you, and zero for you.

22:15.649 --> 22:20.403
Exactly. And is it a "we"
when you got two ringers?

22:22.280 --> 22:24.574
Oh, my god! You knew.

22:24.616 --> 22:28.828
Well, I figured Robin's
swing had lost some power.

22:28.870 --> 22:30.288
Frost!

22:30.330 --> 22:31.915
And mom ...
you haven't played in a while.

22:31.957 --> 22:34.793
We thought
we were  rustier than we were.

22:34.834 --> 22:38.838
We scored one run ... one.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.759
- I think you played really well.
- The drug unit's gonna destroy us.

22:42.794 --> 22:44.386
Well, not if you let us play.

22:44.427 --> 22:47.389
And by "us,"
you mean Camille and Robin?

22:47.430 --> 22:50.850
You're a very sore loser.
I did make it to the first base.

22:50.892 --> 22:53.186
- You don't say "the".
- What?

22:53.228 --> 22:55.772
You made it to first base
because you were walked.

22:55.814 --> 22:57.232
You know, walking's good.

22:57.274 --> 22:59.067
- To the walk.
- Maura: To the walk.

22:59.102 --> 23:00.068
Walking.

23:00.103 --> 23:02.320
[ laughter ]

23:02.362 --> 23:05.615
[ thud ] Ow!
Why are you kicking my leg?

23:05.657 --> 23:11.079
I s-should hand it to Robin and Camille.

23:11.121 --> 23:13.832
Jane, did you hurt your neck?
Are you having a muscle spasm?

23:13.874 --> 23:15.500
Really?

23:15.535 --> 23:19.045
- I'd like to propose a toast.
- That's great sportsmanship.

23:19.087 --> 23:20.505
See?
Toasting the winning team.

23:20.547 --> 23:23.300
Uh, to two wonderful people

23:23.335 --> 23:27.012
who have taught me the meaning
of love and commitment ...

23:27.047 --> 23:29.681
My mom...
and her partner, Robin.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.145
- Barry, you knew?
- Yeah, mom, I knew.

23:35.186 --> 23:38.189
I had been agonizing
over this for years.

23:38.231 --> 23:40.275
You never brought it up.
It wasn't my business.

23:40.310 --> 23:43.570
[ sighs ]
Honey.

23:45.113 --> 23:46.990
I figured if you wanted
to tell me, you would.

23:47.032 --> 23:50.869
I told you. You've never
given him enough credit.

23:50.911 --> 23:52.621
I just wish I'd known.

23:52.656 --> 23:54.831
How many times have
I invited you to Massachusetts?

23:54.873 --> 23:57.292
I kept hoping you'd make
an honest woman out of her.

23:57.334 --> 24:00.378
- I'm glad you finally have.
- Thank you.

24:00.413 --> 24:03.423
- Congratulations.
- Yes, congratulations.

24:03.465 --> 24:04.925
When is the wedding day?

24:04.966 --> 24:07.469
We actually haven't
even set the date yet.

24:07.510 --> 24:09.888
It's ... it was just
time to tell you, Barry.

24:09.971 --> 24:12.974
I couldn't get
married without you.

24:13.016 --> 24:16.019
- You'll be our best man?
- You know I will.

24:16.061 --> 24:18.688
Oh, and I have a great
dress I haven't worn yet.

24:18.730 --> 24:20.023
You haven't been invited.

24:20.065 --> 24:22.567
Listen, when we have our
wedding, you'll all be welcome.

24:22.609 --> 24:23.985
We'd love to have you join us.

24:24.027 --> 24:26.780
All right, well, this
calls for champagne.

24:26.821 --> 24:29.324
- Losing team is buying.
- Hear, hear!

24:29.366 --> 24:33.620
- As long as winning team stops mocking.
- Sorry, sorry!

24:36.331 --> 24:38.083
[ siren wailing in distance ]

24:42.963 --> 24:46.967
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

24:47.008 --> 24:51.555
- I wanted to apologize.
- Oh? What did you do?

24:52.597 --> 24:55.850
- Come inside.
- I can't.

24:57.435 --> 25:00.272
I'm so sorry. We ...
we can talk out here.

25:00.313 --> 25:02.274
I don't mean I can't
make it up your stairs.

25:02.315 --> 25:04.484
I mean
I don't want to go inside.

25:08.154 --> 25:13.743
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs to hear your apology.

25:13.785 --> 25:16.705
It might take me a while.

25:16.746 --> 25:19.708
Good.
I have to put my glove away.

25:40.228 --> 25:43.189
No. Okay.

25:47.903 --> 25:50.572
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

25:50.607 --> 25:51.573
[ knock on door ]

25:54.200 --> 25:56.328
Um, coming!

25:56.369 --> 26:00.624
Coming.
Coming. Okay.

26:05.462 --> 26:09.341
Hey.
Are you okay?

26:09.376 --> 26:11.843
[ panting ]
Yeah. I'm fine.

26:11.885 --> 26:14.262
Uh, come in.
Um, sit down.

26:16.848 --> 26:18.725
Can ... can I get
you a beer or...

26:18.767 --> 26:22.145
- Maybe a water.
- A water. Okay.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.855
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

26:26.942 --> 26:29.110
I remember the last time I was here.

26:31.488 --> 26:34.574
Right before your last
tour in Afghanistan.

26:34.616 --> 26:36.785
[ breathes shakily ]

26:36.868 --> 26:38.620
[ exhales sharply ]

26:38.662 --> 26:40.872
My final tour.

26:44.334 --> 26:47.254
It's like the last run on a ski slope.

26:47.295 --> 26:48.964
You know as you're falling
you shouldn't have taken it.

26:53.635 --> 26:58.431
Thank you for coming up.
I-I know you didn't want to.

26:58.466 --> 27:03.228
I did. I ju...
I didn't want to be this close to you.

27:03.270 --> 27:05.814
Casey.

27:08.483 --> 27:12.696
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

27:12.737 --> 27:14.614
I asked Sergeant Korsak

27:14.656 --> 27:16.950
to look after Elsie
because I'm having surgery.

27:16.992 --> 27:19.953
- Surgery? W-when?
- Soon.

27:19.995 --> 27:22.831
- The stem-cell trials?
- No. I'm not a candidate.

27:22.866 --> 27:24.374
I found a neurosurgeon.

27:24.409 --> 27:27.043
He thinks he can remove
the, uh, shrapnel and bone

27:27.078 --> 27:29.254
shards from pressing
against my spinal cord.

27:29.296 --> 27:32.340
- Casey, that's incredible.
- There are no guarantees,

27:32.375 --> 27:35.510
and, uh... and there
will be months of rehab.

27:35.545 --> 27:37.721
But it's the first crack of light
I've seen in a pretty dark tunnel.

27:37.756 --> 27:40.056
Well, let me ...
let me help you.

27:41.391 --> 27:42.893
I-I want to go through this with you.

27:42.934 --> 27:44.519
That's exactly why I
didn't get in touch.

27:44.603 --> 27:49.232
Casey...
I-it doesn't matter, okay?

27:49.274 --> 27:52.193
- I care about you.
- No.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.945
This is no way to start a relationship,

27:53.987 --> 27:55.822
and this is where we are ...
at the beginning.

27:55.864 --> 27:58.992
Okay, well,
let's get to the middle.

27:59.034 --> 28:00.702
I want to do this.

28:00.737 --> 28:03.413
Taking care of an invalid
is an ugly form of intimacy.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.998
There's no romance in it, Jane.

28:07.125 --> 28:12.505
This injury isn't you.
This is you.

28:12.547 --> 28:15.217
I should have asked you not to go.

28:16.927 --> 28:18.887
I should have asked you to wait.

28:24.684 --> 28:28.338
Did you see someone
else while I was gone?

28:31.942 --> 28:33.610
Yes.

28:35.111 --> 28:37.197
Did you care about him?

28:40.116 --> 28:41.326
Yes.

28:43.286 --> 28:47.832
- Then you'll find someone again.
- What? No.

28:47.874 --> 28:49.501
Casey, wait a minute. Wait.

28:49.543 --> 28:52.212
It's over with him.
It's ... it's been over.

28:52.254 --> 28:54.673
Look, I realized that
when I saw you again

28:54.714 --> 28:56.508
how much I want this to work.

28:56.543 --> 28:58.636
- This won't work.
- It will.

28:58.678 --> 29:02.097
Casey, please, just
give me a chance. Please.

29:02.138 --> 29:07.018
- Do one thing for me.
- Anything.

29:09.980 --> 29:15.277
Let me kiss you...
and then let me go.

29:32.168 --> 29:34.254
Casey, please, please.

29:47.058 --> 29:49.227
Goodbye, Jane.

30:06.519 --> 30:08.688
[ sighs ] 

30:11.816 --> 30:13.818
[ knock on door ]

30:19.198 --> 30:22.368
- Where do socks go?
- All you need is a half-inch gap

30:22.403 --> 30:24.746
for them to slip under
the agitator paddle.

30:24.787 --> 30:28.166
So not sock heaven.

30:28.208 --> 30:29.792
Check your drawers.

30:29.834 --> 30:34.422
Static electricity causes them
to stick to other clothing.

30:34.464 --> 30:36.674
I hope Enzo gets to
go to football heaven.

30:37.550 --> 30:43.765
- Thank you for coming.
- Don't throw them away!

30:44.849 --> 30:47.143
They don't have partners.
They're making me sad.

30:47.185 --> 30:50.730
Okay.
Tell me what he said.

30:50.772 --> 30:54.734
He is having surgery to
remove bone and shrapnel.

30:56.611 --> 30:58.738
What?
What's with the weird look?

30:58.780 --> 31:01.741
- It's nothing.
- Hives, Maura.

31:01.783 --> 31:04.160
Even white lies make you itch.

31:07.956 --> 31:09.374
[ sighs ]
Okay.

31:09.415 --> 31:13.503
Casey's condition is called
cauda equina syndrome.

31:13.545 --> 31:16.089
From what I've observed in him,

31:16.130 --> 31:20.927
it probably involves T-11
and 12 and maybe l-1.

31:20.969 --> 31:23.638
Same question ...
why the weird look?

31:25.515 --> 31:30.019
Surgery on a partially impaired
paraplegic is very risky.

31:30.061 --> 31:35.692
- Well, you're not a neurosurgeon.
- You're right. I'm not.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.362
So no guessing.

31:40.780 --> 31:43.366
I just want to pretend
like it's all gonna be fine.

31:43.401 --> 31:47.579
- Can you do that with me?
- I can try.

31:52.041 --> 31:55.962
Salute, Elsie. Good girl!
Good salute, Elsie.

31:56.004 --> 31:58.214
- That wasn't a salute.
- Yes, it was.

31:58.256 --> 31:59.841
Looked like "shake" to me.

31:59.883 --> 32:01.092
<i>Jane: Anybody want a bagel?</i>

32:01.134 --> 32:02.969
Yeah. Thanks.

32:04.679 --> 32:06.180
All right, so, where are we?

32:06.222 --> 32:08.349
- We are nowhere.
- We better get somewhere

32:08.391 --> 32:09.934
or Cavanaugh's gonna
tear off some heads.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.728
Maybe I can help.

32:11.769 --> 32:13.771
Thanks to the
team-building softball game,

32:13.806 --> 32:17.066
the crime lab stayed up all night
to get these results to you.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.943
I thought they were helping
us solve murders because ...

32:18.985 --> 32:20.320
oh, I don't know...
it's their job.

32:20.361 --> 32:23.489
The blue paint on the
floor mat is consistent

32:23.531 --> 32:27.160
with the paint used for
the BCU field stencils.

32:27.202 --> 32:29.370
That's right where the
killer would have been.

32:29.412 --> 32:31.497
Frost, you said that
Enzo had season tickets.

32:31.532 --> 32:34.167
- Was he at Saturday's game?
- No. His ticket wasn't used,

32:34.202 --> 32:36.169
so I followed up with
his office manager.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.796
- Enzo had to work on a wedding cake.
- It was the first game of the season,

32:38.831 --> 32:42.842
which means Enzo didn't transfer
that field paint inside his van.

32:42.884 --> 32:45.178
Maybe our murderer did.

32:45.220 --> 32:48.056
I didn't mean anything when I
looked at it, but watch this.

32:48.097 --> 32:52.185
Enzo was watching this
clip from Saturday's game.

32:52.227 --> 32:54.812
<i>What kind of call is that?</i>

32:54.854 --> 32:56.814
Jane: Coach Phillips?
What do we know about him?

32:56.856 --> 32:59.525
Jane, what would be the motive? Enzo
hadn't played for him for five years.

32:59.567 --> 33:01.819
Phillips was a contender for
a division I coaching gig.

33:01.854 --> 33:05.573
It went away after BCU lost
that season five years ago.

33:05.615 --> 33:08.660
<i>Am I disappointed?
Yeah, yeah, I'm disappointed.</i>

33:08.695 --> 33:11.913
<i>Coaching a division
1 team is a dream of mine.</i>

33:11.955 --> 33:13.206
<i>But, uh, BCU ...</i>

33:13.248 --> 33:15.625
<i>we had a great run there [sighs]</i>

33:15.667 --> 33:17.835
<i>Till Enzo hurt himself.</i>

33:17.877 --> 33:19.587
Sounds like phillips blames Enzo.

33:19.629 --> 33:23.216
Well, that blue paint only tells us
that our killer was on that field.

33:23.258 --> 33:25.093
Frost, you get the phone working yet?

33:25.128 --> 33:27.220
No.
Got to put the battery back in.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.847
Okay, I want to see what
else Enzo was watching

33:29.889 --> 33:31.766
the night before he was killed.

33:31.808 --> 33:34.811
- His laptop is in bric.
- Okay.

33:35.895 --> 33:41.067
Sergeant Korsak, did Casey tell
you why he needed you to take Elsie?

33:41.109 --> 33:43.820
No. He just said she might
need a home for a few months.

33:43.861 --> 33:46.823
He mentioned something I
didn't want Jane to hear.

33:46.864 --> 33:48.449
What was that?

33:48.484 --> 33:50.159
He made me promise I
would take care of Elsie

33:50.201 --> 33:51.494
if anything happened to him.

33:53.079 --> 33:55.540
- Hey, you guys coming?
- Yep.

33:58.209 --> 34:02.171
Okay.
We got one shot at this.

34:02.213 --> 34:05.174
If there's any moisture,
the circuits will fry themselves.

34:05.216 --> 34:07.844
- Turn it on.
- Do I have witnesses?

34:07.927 --> 34:11.973
Sergeant Detective Korsak
is telling me to turn this phone on.

34:12.014 --> 34:13.808
Turn the damn phone on, Frost.

34:13.850 --> 34:19.188
I want it in writing that this
one is not on me if this phone...

34:21.315 --> 34:25.862
It's dead.
So much for your rice idea.

34:27.196 --> 34:30.699
This is the whole list of
video files Enzo was watching.

34:30.742 --> 34:32.202
Can you play that one?

34:34.913 --> 34:37.248
<i>BCU going for the money
with a hand-off to end zone.</i>

34:37.290 --> 34:38.498
<i>Wow! Look at Womack</i>

34:38.534 --> 34:41.585
<i>as he breaks to the
strong sie and ... oh, no!</i>

34:41.621 --> 34:44.630
<i>He's not getting up.
Folks, this does not look good.</i>

34:44.672 --> 34:47.257
Ugh.
Why was Enzo watching that?

34:47.300 --> 34:48.426
You see the right guard?

34:48.460 --> 34:49.969
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:50.004 --> 34:52.554
I didn't.
What are you talking about?

34:54.181 --> 34:55.266
<i>Let's see that again.</i>

34:55.308 --> 34:58.728
<i>The normally sure-footed right guard
looks like he slips on the turf.</i>

34:58.770 --> 35:01.981
<i>And there goes hard-charging Der'on
Martin flying in at full speed.</i>

35:02.023 --> 35:04.817
<i>Enzo is down! Ouch!</i>

35:04.852 --> 35:07.904
Frost, play that clip
from Saturday's game.

35:07.946 --> 35:11.908
<i>Marcus to the right on a hand-off.</i>

35:11.950 --> 35:13.493
<i>Oh! How did that happen?</i>

35:13.535 --> 35:17.017
<i>Looks like BCU's right guard
lost his footing and left</i>

35:17.018 --> 35:20.500
<i>running back Jeff Marcus
unprotected for that nasty hit.</i>

35:20.542 --> 35:22.919
<i>Ouch! It reminds me of that hit</i>

35:22.961 --> 35:26.339
<i>that ended Enzo Womack's
carer five years ago.</i>

35:26.381 --> 35:28.883
I think we just figured
out what got Enzo killed.

35:36.326 --> 35:39.955
<i>Oh! That was a nasty hit. </i>

35:42.082 --> 35:44.167
What? What did ...
what did you see?

35:44.168 --> 35:46.253
I'd like to know what got Enzo killed.

35:46.295 --> 35:50.465
Both BCU right guards, who
played five years apart,

35:50.500 --> 35:52.301
faked the same trip on the same play.

35:52.336 --> 35:56.096
Frost: To make sure their running
back got tackled and didn't score.

35:56.131 --> 35:59.433
This is like the day I took
that A.P. calculus exam.

35:59.468 --> 36:01.410
You know, I couldn't
have solved that inverse

36:01.411 --> 36:03.353
derivative problem if
my life depended on it.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.063
Calm down.
Calm down, okay?

36:05.105 --> 36:07.524
For once, I get to
explain something to you.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.693
Frost, can you freeze
both bad plays?

36:09.735 --> 36:12.154
[ keyboard clacking, computer beeps ]

36:12.189 --> 36:14.615
That right guard and at
least one other player ...

36:14.656 --> 36:17.784
probably the quarterback...
fixed that game in 2007.

36:17.826 --> 36:22.289
Okay, and that right guard
fixed the same play five years later.

36:22.331 --> 36:26.710
Are you saying BCU players from
two separate seasons threw games?

36:26.745 --> 36:30.255
Altered games. It's too easy
to get caught if you throw them.

36:30.297 --> 36:31.840
If you just shave points...

36:31.875 --> 36:34.092
Frost, can we see both quarterbacks?

36:34.176 --> 36:35.502
[ keyboard clacking, computer beeps ]

36:35.844 --> 36:37.522
Yeah, right there.

36:38.013 --> 36:39.265
Both quarterbacks
made identical signals.

36:39.306 --> 36:40.724
That says to me,
"we're throwing the play."

36:40.766 --> 36:42.977
Watch their eyes right
before they tap their helmets.

36:43.018 --> 36:46.188
Jane: Yeah, you're right.

36:47.391 --> 36:50.150
We have a shot caller ...
who are they looking at?

36:50.192 --> 36:53.988
Frost, do you have any other angles?
So, Enzo must have realized

36:54.029 --> 36:55.364
the trip that ended his
career wasn't accidental.

36:55.406 --> 36:56.949
But why would the
right guard fake a trip?

36:56.991 --> 36:58.367
Enzo was his teammate.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.035
The players who were cheating
weren't trying to hurt him.

37:00.077 --> 37:01.537
They were just trying
to keep him from scoring.

37:01.578 --> 37:04.540
To change the over/under.

37:04.575 --> 37:06.583
- That's what this is about.
- Of course.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.544
What?
Over/under what?

37:08.579 --> 37:10.838
Over/under is a type of bet.

37:10.879 --> 37:13.340
Oddsmakers announce a number
before a game. It's their

37:13.341 --> 37:15.801
best guess of what the
final combined score will be.

37:15.843 --> 37:18.220
And I can bet over
or under that number.

37:18.255 --> 37:20.055
- Yes.
- Okay, I think I understand.

37:20.097 --> 37:22.766
So if the teams' scores,
when added together,

37:22.850 --> 37:24.935
are lower than predicted, I win.

37:24.970 --> 37:28.105
Yes. And if you know that
there are dirty players

37:28.147 --> 37:30.149
that are fixing the game
to keep the score down,

37:30.190 --> 37:32.026
you bet on the under,
and then you win big.

37:32.067 --> 37:34.069
Yeah, but why would
a college player cheat,

37:34.111 --> 37:36.614
especially at a prestigious
academic university?

37:36.655 --> 37:38.657
Well, BCU is a division 3
football program.

37:38.699 --> 37:40.284
There's no money, no scholarships.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.703
They're having a car-wash
fundraiser to buy equipment.

37:42.745 --> 37:45.664
Got another angle...
sideline camera.

37:48.334 --> 37:49.918
Coach Phillips is the shot caller.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.462
I don't think so.
Play it again.

37:55.633 --> 37:57.301
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.345
Okay, play both the 2007
game and Saturday's game.

37:59.386 --> 38:00.887
Watch Mackenzie.

38:07.895 --> 38:10.773
You see that?
He dropped the towel both times.

38:13.901 --> 38:15.486
[ cellphone chimes, beeps ]

38:15.527 --> 38:18.697
Uh, the results are back on the
substance found in Enzo's wounds.

38:18.739 --> 38:20.366
It's analgesic heat rub.

38:20.407 --> 38:23.202
And the fibers I found were
from cotton sports tape.

38:24.787 --> 38:26.873
Maura...

38:27.908 --> 38:30.584
you said the murder weapon had a hilt?

38:30.626 --> 38:32.419
Could it be a multipurpose
tool, like this one?

38:34.546 --> 38:36.382
Yes.
[ cellphone rings ]

38:36.417 --> 38:38.217
Is that Enzo's phone?

38:38.258 --> 38:40.719
Okay, you don't get
credit for fixing it.

38:40.754 --> 38:41.845
- Give it to me.
- No.

38:41.887 --> 38:45.891
- I can look at cellphones, too.
- Give it to me and let me plug it in.

38:47.101 --> 38:48.560
Thank you.

38:51.563 --> 38:55.046
Here's his last text message.
To Dan Mackenzie, 7:54 A.M.

38:55.047 --> 38:57.111
Right before he went to the car wash.

38:57.146 --> 38:59.071
"Need to talk. I hope I'm crazy.

38:59.113 --> 39:01.657
I think coach has BCU
players shaving points."

39:01.699 --> 39:04.285
- He thought his coach was dirty.
- "I hope I'm crazy."

39:04.326 --> 39:06.036
We didn't want to accuse
the program he loved

39:06.078 --> 39:07.621
unless he was sure he was right.

39:07.663 --> 39:10.082
So he went to the person
he trusted the most ...

39:10.124 --> 39:12.626
his former teammate Dan Mackenzie.

39:12.668 --> 39:14.128
It shouldn't be so swollen.

39:14.211 --> 39:17.339
How many times I got to tell
you to ice this sucker, huh?

39:20.134 --> 39:21.844
Hey, you can't be in here.
There's no women allowed.

39:21.885 --> 39:24.847
- BCU just made an exception.
- Well, what's this about?

39:24.888 --> 39:28.142
Frost: We checked your stats, Dan.
You were a good field-goal kicker.

39:28.183 --> 39:29.476
But suddenly, you started missing.

39:29.518 --> 39:32.563
- Was that when it started?
- When what started?

39:32.605 --> 39:34.898
You were missing kicks to shave points.

39:34.933 --> 39:36.108
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

39:36.150 --> 39:38.694
We're talking about basic greed.

39:38.736 --> 39:41.989
Living pretty large for a guy making
$40,000 as a D-3 athletic trainer.

39:46.327 --> 39:49.997
- I want a lawyer.
- You came up with this scheme in college,

39:50.039 --> 39:52.875
but you knew Enzo wouldn't
cheat 'cause he was a good guy.

39:52.910 --> 39:54.126
And he was going to
the pros. You weren't.

39:54.168 --> 39:58.255
He ... he ... he was accusing
the team of cheating.

39:58.297 --> 40:00.633
He was gonna give the
BCU program a bad name.

40:00.674 --> 40:02.092
Enzo sent you a text
before you killed him.

40:02.127 --> 40:05.554
He thought coach Phillips
was corrupting the players.

40:05.589 --> 40:07.014
It never occurred
to him it was his friend.

40:07.256 --> 40:10.601
You're under arrest for
the murder of Enzo Womack.

40:23.906 --> 40:27.660
Hey.
What are you doing here?

40:27.701 --> 40:32.164
I know you wanted me to pretend
that everything will be fine.

40:33.499 --> 40:39.004
- What's that?
- It's some research I did

40:39.046 --> 40:42.633
on decompressive lumbar spine surgery.

40:42.675 --> 40:46.178
- I don't want to know.
- Jane, you need to know.

40:46.220 --> 40:50.975
Why? I mean,
he said goodbye, Maura, so...

40:51.316 --> 40:56.772
Jane, if you care
about him, you'll look.

41:00.818 --> 41:02.569
How bad is it?

41:06.407 --> 41:07.716
Bad.

41:13.817 --> 41:19.214
- What am I gonna do?
- I wish I knew.
