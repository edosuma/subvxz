WEBVTT

00:03.554 --> 00:05.647
Malory Archer. Ho.

00:05.823 --> 00:08.485
You get more beautiful
every time I see you.

00:08.659 --> 00:10.650
- Oh-ho-ho, Gussy.
- Minx.

00:10.828 --> 00:14.264
You'll be the death of me yet.
But if I die...

00:14.432 --> 00:17.595
let it be with the name of this
dusky jewel upon my lips.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.737
Lord Feltchley,
may I present Miss Lana Kane?

00:20.905 --> 00:22.998
Yes, you bloody well may.

00:23.174 --> 00:24.937
So nice to, uh... Wow.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.634
Okay, that's kidskin
you're slobbering on, so...

00:27.812 --> 00:28.972
Okay.

00:29.146 --> 00:32.308
Wouldn't want to offend
that boyfriend of yours, eh, wot?

00:32.482 --> 00:34.508
No offense taken, Your Lordship.

00:34.685 --> 00:36.619
Glad to hear it. Whoever you are.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.721
Cyril Figgis, ISIS Comptroller.

00:38.889 --> 00:40.186
- And also my...
- Boyfriend.

00:40.357 --> 00:41.847
- Person I'm dating.
- No, he isn't.

00:42.026 --> 00:43.050
- We date.
- No, you don't.

00:43.227 --> 00:44.854
- Ha.
- No, no, no.

00:45.029 --> 00:48.521
Your man's a rakish chap.
Air of mystery, chiseled good looks?

00:48.699 --> 00:51.497
- Oh, I think maybe you mean my ex?
- Oh.

00:51.669 --> 00:53.967
- Archer.
- Archer, exactly just.

00:54.138 --> 00:57.574
And if memory serves,
not only handsome, but also...

00:57.742 --> 00:59.107
A secret agent.

01:00.478 --> 01:03.845
That's what I am.
And I shouldn't even be saying that...

01:04.013 --> 01:07.279
but you have a certain
thickness about you...

01:07.451 --> 01:08.975
that I very find appealing...

01:09.153 --> 01:11.383
I find
your drunkenness very unappealing...

01:11.555 --> 01:13.648
I am drunk
or I wouldn't be talking to you.

01:13.824 --> 01:17.351
- So if you'll please excuse me.
- Hey, come on. Don't be like that.

01:18.696 --> 01:20.459
- Whoops.
- Sterling, look out.

01:20.631 --> 01:23.691
Feltchley, you dirty Sassenach.

01:23.868 --> 01:28.271
Free Irishmen will never bow down
before the English crown.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.068
Oh là là, Sterling Archer.

01:34.245 --> 01:35.542
That was totally ninja.

01:37.114 --> 01:38.775
Yeah, if you're...

01:38.949 --> 01:40.678
into that. Hmm?
- Lana?

01:40.851 --> 01:43.081
- Hon? Hello?
- Huh? Hey.

01:44.221 --> 01:46.883
- What's up, buddy?
- Ugh. Nothing.

01:47.057 --> 01:48.615
Oh, dear.

01:48.793 --> 01:51.728
Good show, Archer.
Really saved my bacon there.

01:51.896 --> 01:55.127
Hey, come on. You know I'd never
let anything happen to your bacon.

01:55.299 --> 01:58.359
- I love you, Santa Claus.
- What?

01:59.537 --> 02:00.561
I do.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074

02:32.636 --> 02:34.501
Cyril, we've got big problems.

02:34.672 --> 02:36.139
Well, it may seem
daunting now...

02:36.307 --> 02:39.674
but in the long run the HSA
makes a lot more sense than flex accounts.

02:39.844 --> 02:41.744
I don't mean the health plan.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.608
Unless it covers
Wandering Eye Syndrome.

02:44.782 --> 02:47.342
That depends on if that's a real thing.

02:47.518 --> 02:50.282
Oh, it's very real. And Lana has it.

02:50.454 --> 02:51.887
- Wait, what?
- Cyril, I know...

02:52.056 --> 02:54.456
you saw how she looked
at Sterling last night.

02:54.625 --> 02:56.456
Well, I think she was
just shaken up...

02:56.627 --> 02:58.060
Stirred up, Cyril.

02:58.229 --> 03:01.426
- In the loins.
- You think her loins were stirring?

03:01.599 --> 03:05.262
- Lf not frothing.
- Frothing? Great. What should I do?

03:05.436 --> 03:10.931
We should make you into someone for
whom Lana's loins get equally frothy.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.100
And how exactly would we do that?

03:14.278 --> 03:16.508
She's obviously attracted
to men of danger.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.772
- Like Archer.
- Exactly.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.008
- The perfect field agent.
- Who better to train you to become one?

03:21.185 --> 03:23.176
Archer train me? To be a field agent?

03:23.354 --> 03:24.548
He's already been briefed.

03:24.722 --> 03:28.123
But only on the "what,"
mind you, not the "why."

03:28.292 --> 03:30.453
No sense telling him it's about Lana...

03:30.628 --> 03:32.323
- Boy, wait till I tell her.
- No.

03:32.496 --> 03:36.364
Cyril. Under no circumstance
is Lana to know about our little...

03:36.533 --> 03:39.229
plan.
- Right. I think. Oh.

03:39.403 --> 03:41.394
- But about plans: Health plan switchover?
- Cyril.

03:41.572 --> 03:44.006
I'll take care of whatever that is.

03:44.174 --> 03:46.574
You just concentrate on your training.

03:46.744 --> 03:50.339
- And Archer's really okay with this?
- Oh, not at all.

03:50.781 --> 03:53.545
Which is just gravy.

03:53.717 --> 03:56.845
No, I just let mother think that
because I know what she's up to...

03:57.021 --> 03:58.921
vis-à-vis Cyril and Lana and me.

03:59.089 --> 04:01.489
And it's not broadening Cyril's horizons.

04:01.659 --> 04:04.025
Trust me, Mother's idea
of horizon-broadening...

04:04.194 --> 04:05.491
is a lot of fights...

04:05.663 --> 04:08.223
walking home from a lot
of jazz-tap lessons.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.231
I so enjoy our talks. You got them?

04:14.738 --> 04:16.262
They're loaded and ready to go?

04:17.608 --> 04:20.577
Seriously, Krieger, you are my Oprah.

04:20.744 --> 04:23.872
So obviously I'm not happy
about this whole arrangement, but...

04:24.048 --> 04:25.345
But your mother is, so...

04:25.516 --> 04:26.915
But I wonder what Lana thinks?

04:27.084 --> 04:29.746
Oh, Lana's not need-to-know on this.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.684
Wow, "open purse, remove balls" huh?

04:32.856 --> 04:35.882
I'm sure it's not the first time
you kept a secret from Lana.

04:36.060 --> 04:37.789
Uh... Hello. Herpes?

04:37.962 --> 04:39.896
- You gave Lana herpes?
Ahem.

04:40.064 --> 04:41.588
- Hello, Cheryl.
- It's Carol.

04:41.765 --> 04:43.027
What? Since when?

04:43.200 --> 04:46.226
Since I had it legally changed
because you always call me Carol.

04:46.403 --> 04:48.064
Wow, that's...

04:48.238 --> 04:50.206
- Excuse us.
- Ugh.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.569
Okay, now what is this herpes business?

04:52.743 --> 04:54.711
Sorry, bad joke. And a false alarm.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.745
- Lesson one, get used to that.
- Should I be writing this down?

04:57.915 --> 05:01.078
No. Never leave a paper trail.
That's lesson one.

05:01.251 --> 05:02.741
- So ditch this.
- Hey, that's...

05:02.920 --> 05:05.388
Ow! Jesus.
- My dead mom's pen.

05:05.556 --> 05:09.185
Cyril did that.
This is what a real field agent uses.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.952
Huh. Point's a lot finer than I prefer.

05:11.128 --> 05:13.460
- That's because it's a hypodermic needle...
- What?

05:13.630 --> 05:16.599
And the cartridge is full
of a deadly super-toxin called...

05:16.767 --> 05:18.598
Poizocaine.

05:18.769 --> 05:20.532
- Here. Keep it in here.
- Uh... Hey, whoa.

05:20.704 --> 05:22.638
- Wait a minute.
- But be careful.

05:22.806 --> 05:25.274
The cap slips off for, like, no reason.

05:26.977 --> 05:28.501
Beep, beep, beep.

05:28.679 --> 05:30.340
Oh, you giving me the truck noise...

05:30.514 --> 05:33.915
Karen Carpenter's stunt double?
- I thought you were walking backwards.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.915
It's all the HSA switchover crap.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.317
I'm so over that lame flex account.
When does the HSA start?

05:39.490 --> 05:41.822
When Cyril e-files these DD-14s.

05:41.992 --> 05:44.256
- Oh, Ms. Archer's taking care of those.
- What?

05:44.428 --> 05:46.919
Cyril's off somewhere with Mr. Archer.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.588
I'm sorry, Cyril's off what?
With whom?

05:49.767 --> 05:51.792
I think "somewhere"
was the "what" there.

05:51.969 --> 05:54.938
- "Mr. Archer" was the "whom."
- Worlds collide, huh?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.005
Inevitable for a serial workplace-dater.

05:57.174 --> 06:00.803
- Oh. Yeah. Call the kettle black.
- Ugh.

06:00.978 --> 06:04.505
Did she just race-card me,
or are you totally just gay for her?

06:04.681 --> 06:09.175
I'm the Human Resources Director,
Little Miss Hostile Work Environment.

06:09.353 --> 06:10.877
She is riddled with herpes.

06:11.055 --> 06:14.547
Hey.
Inappropriate workplace topic.

06:14.725 --> 06:16.693
And also a dealbreaker.

06:16.860 --> 06:18.885
- Lesson one: Human intel...
- Oh, shoot.

06:19.063 --> 06:21.327
- I forgot about the DD-14s.
- Screw them.

06:21.498 --> 06:22.658
That's Mother's headache.

06:22.833 --> 06:25.734
You tell me, does it look like I'm allergic?

06:25.903 --> 06:29.236
- Jesus Jones, yes.
- So when I asked for cucumber slices...

06:29.406 --> 06:31.670
which one of you idiots
sent up zucchini?

06:31.842 --> 06:35.005
- That, well, that would be...
- That would be Jane who did that.

06:35.179 --> 06:38.080
- Scatterbrain Jane?
- I know, she's just a mess.

06:38.248 --> 06:40.409
- Because this is obviously zucchini.
Oh.

06:40.584 --> 06:44.418
You'd recognize a vegetable that wasn't
wrapped in a Monte Cristo sandwich.

06:44.588 --> 06:46.419
What's that supposed to mean?

06:47.558 --> 06:49.583
That is Pam, isn't it?

06:49.760 --> 06:52.251
Okay, so, human intelligence entails?

06:52.429 --> 06:56.024
Well, there's false flags,
dead-drops, drop-outs, cut-outs...

06:56.200 --> 06:58.896
active doubles, passive doubles,
dangled moles...

06:59.069 --> 07:01.401
the often under-appreciated honeypot?

07:01.572 --> 07:02.596
- Wow.
- One of my favorites.

07:02.773 --> 07:06.174
- That sounds like a lot to cover.
- Yeah, so we may have to gloss over...

07:06.343 --> 07:08.038
almost all of it, but...

07:08.212 --> 07:10.305
- Aah!
- Weapon.

07:10.481 --> 07:11.607
Oh.

07:11.782 --> 07:13.010
- Oh, hey hon.
- Hey back.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.377
- Hello.
- What's...

07:14.551 --> 07:16.280
- What's this?
- Well, see...

07:16.453 --> 07:17.511
here's the thing...

07:17.688 --> 07:21.124
<i>Under no circumstance is Lana
to know about our little...</i>

07:21.291 --> 07:22.690
<i>... plan.</i>

07:22.860 --> 07:24.122
- Here's what thing?
- Okay.

07:24.294 --> 07:25.386
- Archer's DD-14.
- Yeah.

07:25.562 --> 07:28.053
That we're on our way down
to clear up with Jane.

07:28.232 --> 07:29.460
- Really?
- Well...

07:29.633 --> 07:31.225
you know Scatterbrain Jane.
Heh-heh.

07:31.401 --> 07:33.266
- You're cooking dinner later?
- Yes, I am.

07:33.437 --> 07:34.699
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.806
Speargun?

07:37.141 --> 07:40.076
- Oh. I can't believe I just did that.
- Yeah, dunce.

07:40.244 --> 07:41.575
Now Jane's a loose end.

07:42.412 --> 07:44.505
Hey, Jane.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.649
You getting a snack?

07:46.817 --> 07:49.718
Keep your story vague.
That's lesson one.

07:49.887 --> 07:53.254
But, I mean, morality aside, how
do you keep track of all these lies?

07:53.423 --> 07:58.417
Practice, Cyril.
Lying is, like, 95 percent of what I do.

07:58.595 --> 07:59.755
- In your job.
- Sure.

07:59.930 --> 08:02.194
It was pretty cool how
you handled that speargun.

08:02.366 --> 08:04.926
- Yeah, it was pretty cool.
- Will I get to learn karate?

08:05.102 --> 08:07.593
Karate?
The Dane Cook of martial arts?

08:07.771 --> 08:10.433
- No. ISIS agents use Krav Maga.
- Krav?

08:10.607 --> 08:12.871
We've got an ex-Mossad guy,
he comes in Thursdays.

08:13.043 --> 08:16.342
- Neat.
- Yeah. Tuesdays he does a spin class.

08:16.513 --> 08:19.676
- So will I need sweatpants?
- Cyril. You need all new clothes.

08:19.850 --> 08:21.181
What's wrong with these?

08:24.688 --> 08:26.246
Sorry.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.384
Oh.

08:28.559 --> 08:30.527
I was laughing at your clothes.

08:33.297 --> 08:37.357
Wow, Archer, you were right.
A tailored suit hangs so much better.

08:37.534 --> 08:39.626
That's because Woodhouse is a genius.

08:39.803 --> 08:42.794
Like so many other geniuses,
unappreciated in his life...

08:42.972 --> 08:44.463
Shut up and hem, you old fruit.

08:44.641 --> 08:48.475
- Speaking of fruit, sir.
- Oh, sorry. Heh-heh.

08:48.645 --> 08:51.409
- Cyril, check this out.
Watch yourself.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.709
- Really?
- Don't make it weird. It's your friend.

08:54.885 --> 08:57.115
- And so's this baby.
Jeezy Petes.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.914
It's a Chekhov. Russian-made.

08:59.089 --> 09:01.990
- .25 caliber.
- When would you use an underwear-gun?

09:02.159 --> 09:04.286
Hopefully never. But say you're...

09:04.461 --> 09:06.986
in a Caribbean bungalow
and you're kind of high.

09:07.164 --> 09:09.394
An exotic woman on the bed...

09:09.566 --> 09:12.626
now is she just the high-priced
whore you asked for?

09:12.803 --> 09:14.930
- Or is she an assassin?
- I don't know. I...

09:16.306 --> 09:18.297
Here's room service.
Who ordered champagne?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.806
How should I know.
Exactly.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.308
You're baked, can't remember.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.242
Since when does it take three
huge, surly Jamaican guys...

09:24.414 --> 09:26.814
to deliver one bottle of champagne?
Oh.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.145
- Because they're assassins too.
- Or...

09:29.319 --> 09:32.186
Maybe one guy's a new waiter,
the second one's training him...

09:32.356 --> 09:35.883
and the third's from maintenance,
finally off his lazy ass to fix the AC.

09:36.059 --> 09:37.651
Oh. Yeah, I guess that could happen.

09:37.828 --> 09:40.388
Point is, you come out
of the john waving this around...

09:40.564 --> 09:42.657
nobody's gonna bug you
for a tip. Here.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.199
- It's a gift.
- Thanks, wow, that's slippery.

09:45.369 --> 09:48.964
And the safety's off
so be careful, it could go off for, like...

09:49.139 --> 09:50.197
no reason.

09:50.374 --> 09:52.171
Now what're these pills?

09:52.342 --> 09:55.072
Oh, just antihistamines mostly.

09:55.245 --> 09:59.204
You just rest, Ms. Archer.
We'll take care of these DD-14s for you.

09:59.383 --> 10:02.250
Damn right you will. Idiot.

10:02.419 --> 10:04.046
Pam, look at this.

10:04.221 --> 10:06.849
- Holy shitsnacks.
- We have snacks?

10:07.024 --> 10:08.753
Everybody's personal medical records.

10:08.925 --> 10:11.359
- No, we can't be looking at this.
Are there snacks?

10:11.528 --> 10:12.756
It's totally confidential.

10:12.929 --> 10:14.658
It totally should be. Look at this.

10:14.831 --> 10:15.855
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.594
Cyril tried to get his plan
to cover a penis ensmallment?

10:19.770 --> 10:23.297
- Who'd have thunk it?
- I bet Agent Kane thunks it plenty.

10:23.473 --> 10:24.770
- You bet she does what?
- Oh!

10:24.941 --> 10:26.238
I bet she, uh... Oh.

10:26.410 --> 10:28.378
- I got nothing.
- That's what I thought.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.274
- You seen Cyril?
Is that Lana?

10:30.447 --> 10:32.005
Wow. What happened to you?

10:32.182 --> 10:35.379
Scatterbrain Jane,
but let me just tell you, okay?

10:35.552 --> 10:37.850
You should be thankful you have Cyril.

10:38.021 --> 10:39.716
- Well...
- For about 12 reasons.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.255
Well, thank you, Malory.

10:41.425 --> 10:43.450
But if you don't mind,
I'd prefer to keep...

10:43.627 --> 10:47.154
my personal affairs out of the office.
- Oh, please.

10:47.331 --> 10:49.993
She's had more pens
in that company ink than...

10:50.167 --> 10:52.397
a pen store.
And yet...

10:53.570 --> 10:54.798
does not have herpes.

10:54.971 --> 10:58.930
- Dealunbreaker.
- Ugh.

10:59.109 --> 11:01.669
What's the matter, baby?
Afraid you'll catch something?

11:01.845 --> 11:05.246
No, it's not that. I've just
never been this close to a...

11:05.415 --> 11:07.440
Call girl. It's not an insult, Cyril.

11:07.617 --> 11:09.414
Trinette takes pride in her work.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.678
- I really do.
- Okay.

11:10.854 --> 11:12.253
- So come on budge in.
- Uhn.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.118
- Gosh, yeah.
- Now that's not so bad, is it?

11:15.292 --> 11:17.419
- Ha-ha-ha.
- No. That feels pretty good.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.586
- I can tell. You are gifted.
- Okay.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.096
- God, it's just his gun, Trinette.
Sorry.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.858
Bet this seems pretty weird.

11:25.035 --> 11:27.503
Oh, please.
The sick shit I've done in this apartment?

11:27.671 --> 11:29.730
- Okay.
- And that wasn't all gun, neither.

11:29.906 --> 11:30.998
Ha-ha. No, ma'am.

11:31.174 --> 11:34.701
Hey, can you two focus? Please?
Woodhouse. Are you ready, or what?

11:34.878 --> 11:38.712
Yes, quite ready sir.
Though not entirely willing.

11:38.882 --> 11:42.113
- Yeah, and I don't know if I am, either...
- Could have fooled me.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.309
Hey.
- Oh, Trinette.

11:43.487 --> 11:45.318
It's perfectly safe. You're tangoing...

11:45.489 --> 11:48.720
then your trained field agent eyes
spot two threats.

11:48.892 --> 11:51.326
But they're not trained.
We haven't done this yet.

11:51.495 --> 11:53.292
This is how you train them. So.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.091
- You spot your first threat. Woodhouse.
- Ooh. Hoo.

11:56.266 --> 11:57.665
- My knees aren't...
- Bam, bam, bam.

11:58.034 --> 12:01.060
You put him down. But just shoot
the pad, not Woodhouse.

12:01.238 --> 12:02.899
- Like, actually shoot the gun?
Then.

12:03.073 --> 12:05.337
How else are you gonna learn?
Okay, he's down...

12:05.509 --> 12:07.773
just the pad.
Then you see the second threat.

12:07.944 --> 12:10.412
Oh, no, you're out of ammo.
What are you gonna do?

12:10.580 --> 12:12.241
Oh, that's where the turn comes in?

12:12.416 --> 12:14.008
Duh. Woodhouse. Get in position.

12:14.184 --> 12:15.981
I really need a better health plan.

12:16.153 --> 12:20.214
Shut up. Weapon is hot
and live fire exercise...

12:20.390 --> 12:22.881
in five, six, seven, eight.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.662
Tango, tango, tango. Scan
the ballroom of the Cuban embassy...

12:27.831 --> 12:29.890
for the agent
you're supposed to meet.

12:30.066 --> 12:32.899
You're just some Canadian dude
down here on business...

12:33.069 --> 12:35.503
and threat. Woodhouse.
- Yes.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.230
- Cyril. Shoot.
- Oh, oh.

12:37.407 --> 12:39.841
- Aah!
- Shoot, bitch. Democracy's at stake.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.979
- Oh! Take that, forces of evil.
- Heh. Ooh.

12:43.413 --> 12:45.608
- Whoa.
- Way to go, baby. You hit it.

12:45.782 --> 12:48.080
Yeah. I did, didn't I?

12:48.251 --> 12:50.082
- Second threat.
- Oh. Right, I forgot about...

12:50.253 --> 12:51.743
- Second threat.
Jesus.

12:52.255 --> 12:54.917
- Ow! Christ on sale.
Jesus.

12:55.091 --> 12:57.218
Yeah, Cyril. That was totally ninja.

12:57.394 --> 13:00.261
No, Archer. That was totally uncool.

13:00.430 --> 13:01.920
Sorry, Trinette, did that hurt?

13:02.098 --> 13:04.931
Yeah, it fricking hurt, idiot.
It's ice.

13:05.101 --> 13:08.434
- Okay, we'll use grapes.
- We've only lingonberries, sir.

13:08.605 --> 13:10.266
Ballistically similar to grapes?

13:10.440 --> 13:13.898
Screw your grapes and screw your
whatever-berries, I am out of here.

13:14.077 --> 13:16.545
- No, wait. Trinette, please, l...
- Spying ass bastards.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.273
- Please my fat Irish ass. Ow!
- Ooh.

13:19.449 --> 13:21.280
What the hell's
in your freaking pocket?

13:21.451 --> 13:22.782
Um...

13:23.220 --> 13:24.949
- Ha.
- Oh. Oh.

13:25.121 --> 13:27.055
I don't feel so good.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.157
Me neither.

13:30.327 --> 13:33.091
And voicemail again. Huh.

13:33.263 --> 13:37.290
So, it's me. Duh. And did you say
you'd cook, or did I mishear that?

13:37.467 --> 13:41.164
I know I misheard you about Jane,
because turns out, I ran into her.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.302
Hey, Jane.

13:44.474 --> 13:46.635
You getting a tampon?

13:46.810 --> 13:48.004
Yeah. Loose end.

13:48.178 --> 13:50.442
But I'm sure you had a good reason
to lie to me...

13:50.614 --> 13:52.878
so can't wait to hear what it was.

13:53.149 --> 13:56.312
- Oh, my God, you killed a hooker.
- Call girl.

13:56.486 --> 13:57.578
- She was a...
- No, Cyril.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.654
When they're dead they're just hookers.

13:59.823 --> 14:03.190
God, I said the cap slips
off the poison pen for no reason.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.987
I know, but I just assumed...

14:05.161 --> 14:06.753
that if anything bad happened...

14:06.930 --> 14:11.594
No. Do not say the Chekhov gun, Cyril.
That, sir, is a facile argument.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.793
And also woefully esoteric.

14:13.970 --> 14:15.699
- Woodhouse.
- Fetching a rug, sir.

14:15.872 --> 14:18.500
Now he's fetching a rug. Happy, Cyril?

14:18.675 --> 14:20.506
No. No, I'm not happy.

14:20.677 --> 14:22.474
Well, guess what. Me neither.

14:22.646 --> 14:26.309
I mean, big picture,
I wouldn't say I'm a happy person.

14:26.483 --> 14:28.678
Sir. I have fetched the rug.

14:28.852 --> 14:30.649
Plus now I'm out a rug.

14:33.156 --> 14:36.284
Oh, God.
I should never have agreed to this.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.724
You and your stupid mother
and her stupid frothing loins.

14:39.896 --> 14:44.458
Hey. I know you're upset, but if you
ever mention my mother's loins...

14:44.634 --> 14:46.693
or their frothiness, to me again...

14:46.870 --> 14:50.738
I don't know what I'll do,
but it will be bad.

14:52.075 --> 14:54.839
Now let's go bury this dead hooker.

14:56.413 --> 14:58.404
Shirt tails. We need a password.

14:58.582 --> 14:59.947
- Hang on a second.
Ha-ha-ha.

15:00.116 --> 15:01.310
How you doing, Ms. Archer?

15:01.484 --> 15:02.917
I am good.

15:03.086 --> 15:05.680
- Okay, try... Okay, try "guest."
Real good.

15:05.855 --> 15:08.688
Well, that's just idi... Oh, my God.

15:08.858 --> 15:13.192
I know, right? So here let's make
the co-pay zero, and the deductible...

15:13.363 --> 15:15.354
- Super high, right?
- No, low.

15:15.532 --> 15:17.432
You want the lowest deductible.

15:17.601 --> 15:19.933
But don't you deduct it
on your taxes or something?

15:20.103 --> 15:21.400
- Wow.
- So you want more?

15:21.571 --> 15:23.198
And people think Jane's stupid.

15:23.373 --> 15:25.933
Speaking of, it's probably better...

15:26.109 --> 15:28.703
if Jane was the last one to log in.

15:28.878 --> 15:31.574
You are a bitch.

15:31.748 --> 15:33.113
I am not. What?

15:33.283 --> 15:37.049
Because I don't want Sterling to end up
with a woman like Lana Kane?

15:37.220 --> 15:39.279
My God, a black...

15:39.456 --> 15:41.549
ops field agent?

15:41.725 --> 15:44.751
Thought she was going in a whole
other direction with that.

15:44.928 --> 15:47.362
Because let me tell you,
I was black ops.

15:47.530 --> 15:52.126
And that does not for a young boy
a very merry Christmas make.

15:52.302 --> 15:55.465
Ajax a success, Teheran is ours, stop.

15:55.639 --> 15:59.097
Merry X-mas from Mommy
and Uncle Kermit, stop.

15:59.275 --> 16:02.608
Also, be nicer to Woodhouse, stop.

16:02.779 --> 16:06.237
- You made up the last part, didn't you?
- I did, sir.

16:06.516 --> 16:07.540
Douche.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.708
- Oh, my God.
- I know, right?

16:09.886 --> 16:12.946
This is the most kickass health plan ever.

16:13.123 --> 16:15.387
And I think I just had a flashback, so...

16:15.558 --> 16:18.755
these antihistamines are insane.

16:18.928 --> 16:22.830
Oh, I'm crazy? Cyril, you're the one
who killed a perfectly good hooker.

16:22.999 --> 16:25.058
By accident. We could explain.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.396
To who, Cyril? The cops? Lana?

16:27.570 --> 16:30.403
She'd never forgive me.
Archer, my life is ruined.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.200
And all because Mother cooked up...

16:32.375 --> 16:34.206
this stupid plan...
- But I just...

16:34.377 --> 16:37.437
to make you an agent
just to impress Lana. Ironic, isn't it?

16:37.614 --> 16:39.479
I'm not sure that's technically irony.

16:39.649 --> 16:43.881
What? This is like O. Henry
and Alanis Morissette had a baby...

16:44.054 --> 16:46.579
and named it this exact situation.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.882
- No, it's...
- Yes, it is.

16:48.058 --> 16:51.755
Because a man like you, Cyril,
doesn't deserve a woman like Lana.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.054
You...

16:53.229 --> 16:58.098
You butthole. You set this all up,
just to drive me and Lana apart.

16:59.302 --> 17:01.202
- Well?
- Screw you, Archer.

17:01.371 --> 17:03.896
Hey. Hostile work environment.

17:04.074 --> 17:07.406
Exactly. And I'm gonna file
a hostile work environment lawsuit...

17:07.577 --> 17:10.272
against you, and your mother,
and ISIS, and...

17:10.747 --> 17:12.442
What? Who the hell is that?

17:12.615 --> 17:15.015
- Your confederates in Operation Butthole.
- Cyril.

17:15.185 --> 17:17.449
- Those aren't my confederates.
- Well, nice try...

17:17.619 --> 17:19.281
but Cyril Figgis ain't buying it.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.981
- You hear that? I ain't buying it.
- Cyril.

17:22.592 --> 17:24.526
Oh, my God.
How about now, Cyril?

17:24.694 --> 17:26.662
Are you feeling ready to buy?

17:29.199 --> 17:30.689
To Scatterbrain Jane.

17:30.867 --> 17:33.131
And to plan-covered elective surgery.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.136
And the boob job. That you so need.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.866
And the ass-reduction you so need.

17:39.042 --> 17:40.600
And the skinny-bitch-ectomy you need.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.208
- Oh, my God, did you hear that?
- What do you think it is?

17:44.380 --> 17:46.245
Immigrants.
That's how they do, you know?

17:46.416 --> 17:50.409
Just drive around, listening to raps
and shooting all the jobs.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.948
- Then who are those guys?
- How should I know?

17:54.124 --> 17:58.390
KGB, the Stasi, Shining Path,
this guy I know named Popeye?

17:58.561 --> 17:59.653
I have enemies, okay?

17:59.829 --> 18:01.820
- That's because no one likes you.
- What?

18:01.998 --> 18:03.727
Seriously, do you not sense that?

18:03.900 --> 18:06.494
I am a product of my upbringing, Cyril.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.068
Well, I was a single mother.

18:08.238 --> 18:11.571
And it's a big dangerous world out there.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.067
Are you idiots still even here?

18:14.244 --> 18:15.871
So why aren't you better at this?

18:16.045 --> 18:19.412
I am the best at this, Rain Man,
okay? I'm like...

18:19.582 --> 18:21.209
Who? James Bond?

18:21.384 --> 18:23.511
Well, I don't like
to invite that comparison.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.847
- But yeah, basically.
- So do something.

18:26.022 --> 18:29.423
I'm doing all kinds of stuff, Cyril.
I'm shooting the gun, see?

18:29.592 --> 18:32.117
- I'm driving the car.
- I could drive better than that.

18:32.295 --> 18:34.263
So knock yourself out. I'm ejecting.

18:34.430 --> 18:36.295
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am totally am.

18:36.466 --> 18:37.933
- Stop it. No.
- No.

18:38.101 --> 18:41.366
- Grenades in the glove box.
- Drive me and the hooker to safety or...

18:41.538 --> 18:43.005
Excuse me.
- Lana?

18:43.173 --> 18:45.641
Yeah, I'm looking for two guys.

18:45.809 --> 18:48.141
They're on their way to the morgue?

18:50.947 --> 18:52.847
- Great.
- Archer, what am I gonna tell her?

18:53.016 --> 18:55.849
Well, if you learned anything today,
it won't be the truth.

18:56.119 --> 18:58.917
I don't care if you have
50 dead hookers in the trunk...

18:59.088 --> 19:00.419
you lied to me.

19:00.590 --> 19:02.080
Did not learn anything.

19:02.258 --> 19:05.318
- Well, you shot a machine gun at me.
- Around you.

19:05.495 --> 19:07.258
- Because my feelings were hurt.
- Well...

19:07.430 --> 19:08.988
Why on earth would you lie to me?

19:09.165 --> 19:11.065
I just wanted to show you
I could be...

19:11.234 --> 19:13.600
a supercool ISIS field agent
like Archer, but...

19:13.770 --> 19:16.330
But baby, don't you know I...

19:16.506 --> 19:18.633
like you so much...

19:18.808 --> 19:21.299
because you're exactly the opposite
of Archer?

19:21.477 --> 19:24.412
- Well, yeah, but...
- Not to mention your other qualities.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.573
Oh, you are such a naughty Nelly.

19:27.750 --> 19:31.618
- He just gets a pass? Like Milton Berle?
Yep.

19:32.288 --> 19:34.813
Hey, so how did you know where I was?

19:35.225 --> 19:36.920
When we first started going out...

19:37.093 --> 19:40.085
I may have injected
a tracking device into your body.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.891
In my body? No, no.
Now, that is a breach of trust, Lana.

19:43.066 --> 19:46.001
Do you really wanna open
this can of trust-breachy worms...

19:46.169 --> 19:50.538
right after I caught you and my
ex-boyfriend with a hooker in the trunk?

19:51.241 --> 19:52.606
- I do not.
- You do not.

19:52.775 --> 19:56.677
Oh, and Archer, how's this for ironic?

19:57.280 --> 20:01.273
You know what? I don't have a "one to
some other number of douchebags" scale.

20:01.451 --> 20:04.716
So, six? Oh, my God, Trinette.

20:04.888 --> 20:07.379
Yeah, Trinette, you shitass.

20:07.557 --> 20:09.616
- So you know you have to be punished.
- Yes.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.851
You're gonna walk into our video store...

20:12.028 --> 20:13.495
With the sweet old Korean lady.

20:13.663 --> 20:17.861
- And buy the nastiest, barebackinest,
hard dickinest, ball splapiest...

20:18.034 --> 20:20.195
interracial porno in there.

20:20.370 --> 20:21.962
From the sweet old Korean lady?

20:22.138 --> 20:24.299
Yep. How you feel about that?

20:24.474 --> 20:28.035
- Like I got off pretty easy.
- Night ain't over yet.

20:28.211 --> 20:30.236
- Throw me in a trunk?
- Not part of the plan.

20:30.413 --> 20:32.438
Inject me with some crazy spy poison?

20:32.615 --> 20:35.015
- It was just a harmless tranquilizer.
- You shitass.

20:35.184 --> 20:38.381
I mean, let's be honest, I doubt
that's the first needle you ever...

20:38.554 --> 20:41.079
- Ow!
- I never. Give me your wallet.

20:41.257 --> 20:42.349
I already paid you.

20:42.525 --> 20:46.256
File a customer service complaint.
I'm sure Popeye'd love to hear it.

20:46.429 --> 20:48.863
Hey, come on, you wouldn't tell Popeye.

20:49.032 --> 20:50.397
Oh, watch me.

20:50.566 --> 20:53.194
- Oh. Give me your watch.
- You know how much this thing costs?

20:53.369 --> 20:55.269
Probably less
than a new set of kneecaps.

20:55.438 --> 20:58.498
- There. Happy?
- Almost.

21:00.910 --> 21:03.902
You know, I bet there's a lesson
to be learned from all this.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.379
But l... Oh, shit, my rug.
