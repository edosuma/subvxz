00:04.530 --> 00:07.010
This is Weir.
What's the nature of Major Sheppard's injury?

00:07.050 --> 00:09.810
Some sort of funky alien bug
attached itself to his neck.

00:09.850 --> 00:15.290
Part of Ellia is Human and part of her comes
from a creature we call the Eratus bug.

00:15.330 --> 00:19.570
Now it's possible, by means of this retrovirus,
that we could strip away those parts

00:19.610 --> 00:21.890
<i>and leave only the Human parts behind.</i>

00:21.930 --> 00:23.250
<i>Good Lord!</i>

00:23.290 --> 00:24.970
She took the retrovirus!

00:25.010 --> 00:28.290
- You said it wasn't ready.
- It's not! Not by a long shot!

Are you OK?

00:42.850 --> 00:44.130
Yeah.

00:52.650 --> 00:54.290
This really isn't necessary, Doc!

00:54.330 --> 00:57.010
Yes it is. You've got a serious laceration
in your arm and you've lost a good deal of blood.

00:57.050 --> 00:59.370
Yeah, well, enjoy the ride Colonel,
they're making me walk.

00:59.410 --> 01:03.410
- You have a splinter, Rodney.
- Yes, a very nasty, painful splinter.

01:03.650 --> 01:05.850
<i>Alright, let's have a look at this.</i>

01:10.970 --> 01:12.130
Thank you.

01:12.570 --> 01:15.130
This might hurt a bit.

01:15.970 --> 01:17.650
I'm sure it will.

01:18.330 --> 01:19.610
<i>This doesn't sting?</i>

01:20.410 --> 01:21.530
No.

01:22.370 --> 01:24.850
I know you have a high threshold for pain, but this...

01:24.890 --> 01:26.610
This is what?

01:28.890 --> 01:29.890
Gone.

01:30.130 --> 01:31.130
What?

01:31.170 --> 01:32.810
The feeding mark.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.250
It's completely healed.

02:45.010 --> 02:48.330
<i>- Maybe it wasn't that bad.
- Then where did all the blood come from?</i>

02:48.370 --> 02:50.730
I don't know.
Maybe it just looked a lot worse than it was.

02:50.770 --> 02:54.890
- Well I don't see evidence of any cut at all.
- It's weird, cos it hurt like hell.

02:55.090 --> 02:56.650
You sure the skin was broken?

02:56.690 --> 02:59.850
Yeah, I'm pretty sure. There was a lot of blood.
Maybe it was hers.

02:59.890 --> 03:02.010
It was definitely Human.

03:02.050 --> 03:04.890
I don't know.
Maybe it was a nose bleed.

03:05.370 --> 03:09.330
- Is that supposed to be a joke, Colonel?
- Believe me, this isn't funny.

03:09.370 --> 03:13.130
Give me half a day to run your bloodwork
and analyse it with the data we already have.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.330
We'll figure it out.

03:14.370 --> 03:15.480
And until then?

03:15.481 --> 03:17.871
Well, you're welcome to look over my shoulder.

03:17.890 --> 03:21.250
- Yeah, that's tempting but...
- Just go about your day.

03:34.610 --> 03:36.890
I thought you said you were a runner?

03:36.930 --> 03:38.290
Funny!

03:38.650 --> 03:41.250
I can usually barely keep up.
What's with you?

03:42.050 --> 03:43.890
What's with you?

03:44.250 --> 03:45.450
Water?

03:47.170 --> 03:49.410
<i>Alright, sore loser!</i>

03:49.450 --> 03:52.050
I don't act like a jerk when you beat me.

03:52.450 --> 03:53.890
Yes you do.

03:54.290 --> 03:57.010
OK, then we'll go around again.

03:57.730 --> 03:59.330
Go ahead.

04:00.050 --> 04:01.330
OK grumpy,

04:01.370 --> 04:02.770
I will.

04:07.210 --> 04:08.610
<i>Dr Beckett?</i>

04:10.450 --> 04:12.450
Thought you'd wanna see this.

04:14.850 --> 04:17.529
- Is this from Colonel Sheppard's blood sample?
- That's right.

04:17.570 --> 04:19.649
- And you've run it twice?
- Of course.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.250
OK, let's run it one more time.
I wanna be certain before I tell him.

04:22.290 --> 04:23.530
Right.

04:45.490 --> 04:46.890
Not bad?

04:47.130 --> 04:48.330
Yes, yes.

04:48.770 --> 04:50.330
You're doing very well.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.610
You have been practising.

05:05.970 --> 05:07.370
Not really.

05:33.690 --> 05:38.010
You are showing a considerable leap
in ability, Colonel Sheppard.

05:38.050 --> 05:41.050
You can call me John
when we're off the clock.

05:41.770 --> 05:43.090
Very well...

05:43.330 --> 05:44.690
- John.
<i>- There you go.</i>

05:47.650 --> 05:51.370
Should we continue, or do you...

06:06.410 --> 06:08.770
I'm not really sure just what happened.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.730
Colonel.

06:13.130 --> 06:14.930
That was interesting.

06:15.010 --> 06:17.570
<i>Colonel Sheppard, please report to the infirmary.</i>

06:19.570 --> 06:21.330
You OK?

06:22.210 --> 06:24.490
Dr Beckett will be expecting you.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.410
Yeah.

06:37.890 --> 06:42.530
The good news is, we can now say with some certainty
that Ellia didn't drain away any of your life.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.930
We already knew that.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.370
I suppose.

06:45.410 --> 06:47.970
That's the best good news you could come up with?

06:48.890 --> 06:52.330
It looks like you've been infected
with the Eratus Bug retrovirus.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.770
The one we were working on
to turn Ellia into a Human.

06:54.810 --> 06:57.210
You mean, the one that didn't
turn her into a Human.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.450
Ellia administered the treatment prematurely.
It wasn't ready. It wasn't even supposed to be...

07:00.490 --> 07:03.450
- I'm not blaming you, Doc.
- But you're right,

07:03.490 --> 07:07.890
the transformation was into a creature closer to
the Eratus Bug than to a Human and I know how much you...

07:07.930 --> 07:09.530
- Hate those bugs?
- Yes.

07:09.570 --> 07:14.370
But for one, Ellia was a Wraith and
she took a massive dose of the retrovirus.

07:14.450 --> 07:16.730
Do we know how
the Colonel's system might respond to the drug?

07:16.770 --> 07:17.970
I have no idea.

07:18.010 --> 07:21.370
It was never engineered to be given to a Human.
It was never intended to be given to anyone!

07:21.410 --> 07:22.290
Let go.

07:22.330 --> 07:25.050
But the problem is,
I have no idea how your body will react.

07:25.090 --> 07:26.890
I can't even begin to guess.

07:26.930 --> 07:30.090
If how I feel is any indication, I'm fine.

07:30.610 --> 07:33.810
It's certainly possible
that it's already breaking down in your system.

07:33.850 --> 07:36.130
Ellia's transformation was extreme and immediate.

07:36.170 --> 07:36.930
See?

07:36.970 --> 07:40.450
- But the wound on your arm healed unnaturally fast.
- If there was a wound.

07:40.490 --> 07:43.370
There had to be! Otherwise,
I don't see how you got infected in the first place.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.490
She was spitting an awful lot.

07:45.810 --> 07:47.530
So what? We just monitor it for now?

07:47.570 --> 07:48.410
Aye.

07:48.450 --> 07:50.530
You'll need to check in every six hours.

07:50.570 --> 07:51.610
I can do that.

07:51.650 --> 07:52.730
And you should probably...

07:52.770 --> 07:55.890
Suspend my offworld activities, until we know more.

07:56.090 --> 07:57.450
Thank you.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.890
See you in six hours.

08:13.170 --> 08:14.730
You're working late.

08:16.490 --> 08:18.330
No, not really.

08:19.570 --> 08:20.530
Yeah.

08:20.570 --> 08:22.770
I keep trying to remove it
from the terminal's on the Daedalus.

08:22.810 --> 08:25.490
Somehow the crew keeps
finding a way of putting it back.

08:25.530 --> 08:27.450
Never get between a genius

08:27.490 --> 08:29.090
and a computer game.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.169
Ain't you scheduled to fly out?

08:32.210 --> 08:35.409
I was supposed to, yes. Until I heard about Sheppard.

08:36.490 --> 08:38.370
He's under Beckett's supervision.

08:40.090 --> 08:43.730
If the Lt Colonel finds himself
unable to perform his duties, that's...

08:44.650 --> 08:47.690
You have a ship to command, Colonel!
I wouldn't wanna spread you too thin.

08:47.730 --> 08:50.570
Novak and Hermiod are running
a full diagnostic on our FTL drive.

08:50.610 --> 08:53.650
They're worried about
the constant huge jumping between galaxies.

08:53.690 --> 08:57.690
Which is to say if I need to, I have some time.

09:00.690 --> 09:02.570
OK, let me think about it.

09:04.570 --> 09:05.850
Thank you.

09:08.370 --> 09:10.050
You get chess on there?

09:10.770 --> 09:12.970
As a matter of fact, I do.

09:13.570 --> 09:17.170
Well I have to warn you that
I'm a career military strategist.

09:18.170 --> 09:20.370
Well I'll have to take my chances.

09:39.130 --> 09:40.770
Hey Doc!

09:41.290 --> 09:42.650
This is Sheppard.

09:43.490 --> 09:44.770
<i>Yes Colonel.</i>

09:46.410 --> 09:49.570
We may have to bump up
my first checking.

10:08.590 --> 10:11.950
The retrovirus isn't breaking down in his system,
like we hoped it would.

10:11.990 --> 10:14.550
- You're positive?
- Yes. In fact,

10:14.590 --> 10:17.950
it's beginning to alter his DNA.
If it's allowed to continue,

10:17.990 --> 10:21.190
he'll devolve into a creature
similar to what Ellia became.

10:25.230 --> 10:27.750
- How long do we have?
- I'm not sure exactly.

10:27.790 --> 10:31.230
- Ballpark. Months? Weeks?
- Days. We have days.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.550
OK, what's the plan?

10:35.750 --> 10:38.070
I've injected him with a viral inhibitor.

10:38.110 --> 10:42.270
It should slow down the retrovirus
as far as his cognitive abilities are concerned.

10:42.590 --> 10:44.270
But I'm afraid that's it so far.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.150
We're exploring various
treatments that may or may not be effective, so...

10:47.190 --> 10:48.670
No Carson, we don't have any time to explore.

10:48.710 --> 10:51.790
Come on, there's gotta be something in the Ancient
database that can help you find a treatment.

10:51.830 --> 10:54.190
I know that Elizabeth. We're doing our best.

10:54.230 --> 10:56.550
I'm sorry, I know. Of course you are.

10:58.590 --> 11:00.430
You should talk to him.

11:00.470 --> 11:02.270
He's hiding it very well,

11:02.310 --> 11:05.070
but if I was him, I'd be scared to death.

11:08.950 --> 11:10.630
How am I doing?

11:18.790 --> 11:22.190
Anything that has you speechless, has me concerned.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.630
- You're gonna be fine.
- That's dead man talk.

11:25.670 --> 11:28.670
- No it isn't.
- Have you seen this?

11:28.870 --> 11:32.430
- Beckett is gonna figure this one out.
- I think I already have.

11:33.830 --> 11:36.070
You know who I'm starting to feel like?

11:36.150 --> 11:37.390
Ford.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.310
Now, what happened to you is completely different.

11:39.350 --> 11:42.470
I know, I know, but still, I can feel it.

11:42.510 --> 11:46.510
I mean, I can feel it
changing me inside, like he did.

11:46.910 --> 11:49.030
I don't think that's even possible.

11:49.070 --> 11:53.390
- Look, you're very worried...
- No, no, it's...

11:54.390 --> 11:57.670
One of the best weeks
of my life was when I got my wisdom teeth out.

11:57.710 --> 12:00.630
I was on codeine for a full seven days.
This is kinda the same.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.990
I know I should be in pain.

12:03.030 --> 12:06.550
or at the very least, freaked out by this and I'm not.

12:06.551 --> 12:09.030
And that freaks me out more than anything.

12:09.350 --> 12:12.110
- We're gonna beat this.
- We're gonna beat this?

12:12.150 --> 12:15.150
Beckett will figure this out?
You're gonna be fine?

12:15.390 --> 12:18.590
You really suck at the whole bedside manner thing.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.510
I know, I'm sorry.

12:21.230 --> 12:23.470
But I appreciate the effort.

12:23.950 --> 12:28.510
No! No! No! That would only work if the retrovirus
is doing what we had originally intended it to do.

12:28.550 --> 12:32.550
I disagree. You are not taking into account,
what's happening to his somatic cells.

12:32.590 --> 12:34.950
The only thing I have to take into account,
is how off you are

12:34.990 --> 12:37.750
and I don't think I'm the only one
who sees that, so let's move on.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.070
Wait! Wait! Wait! Oh God.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.590
We're looking at this all wrong.

12:42.630 --> 12:43.990
The best idea we've had so far

12:44.030 --> 12:46.350
is to try to repair his system on the genetic level,

12:46.390 --> 12:49.230
by administering a massive clone,
embryonic stem cells treatment.

12:49.270 --> 12:50.790
I still think it's our best bet.

12:50.830 --> 12:53.070
Introducing more human genetic material into his body,

12:53.110 --> 12:55.030
is only going to give the retrovirus more fuel

12:55.070 --> 12:56.630
I don't know how much simpler I can say that!

12:56.670 --> 12:58.670
Yes, yes, I agree!

12:59.150 --> 13:03.150
That's why we have to use the Eratus Bug stem cells.

13:03.790 --> 13:04.830
Sorry?

13:04.870 --> 13:08.790
The Eratus Bug stem cell, programmed with Human RNA,
wouldn't get rejected by his system

13:08.830 --> 13:11.670
and would be practically ignored
by the current strain of retrovirus.

13:11.710 --> 13:13.870
- We attack it from the inside.
- Exactly,

13:13.910 --> 13:18.310
It would be like our own magic bullet,
that can navigate the retrovirus
and start to repair his mutated cells.

13:18.350 --> 13:21.550
The only bug cultures we have are
from a sample that died a year ago.

13:21.590 --> 13:24.070
<i>I have no doubt we could program
the cells if we had them.</i>

13:24.110 --> 13:29.270
But we do not have the time to artificially produce
a gene therapy of that kind of volume.

13:32.470 --> 13:39.070
Which means, ladies and gentlemen,
we need to go on an egghunt.

13:44.670 --> 13:46.830
It's OK.
Sit. Please.

13:48.670 --> 13:49.870
How's the Colonel?

13:50.270 --> 13:51.590
Not very well.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.070
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

13:53.110 --> 13:54.230
Yes, so am I.

13:54.270 --> 13:57.350
I think it would be best if you do assume
some of Colonel Sheppard's duties, until...

13:57.390 --> 13:58.630
Consider it done.

13:59.070 --> 14:01.070
Just until he's back on his feet.

14:02.470 --> 14:04.270
You two are pretty close, aren't you?

14:07.470 --> 14:10.270
Well, we've been through a lot together.
Yes.

14:12.270 --> 14:15.870
You got the best team in two galaxies,
working on a way to get him back to normal.

14:17.670 --> 14:21.870
My money's on success,
and if you need someone to talk to...

14:21.910 --> 14:24.070
If you could assume those duties,
effective immediately?

14:24.110 --> 14:25.070
I can do that.

14:25.270 --> 14:26.070
Thank you.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.920
The Ancient database has quite
a lot of information about the Eratus Bug.

14:34.960 --> 14:39.240
We know what planet it's on. We know that it likes
cool, damp, dark places to lay it's eggs.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.280
- It shouldn't be that hard to locate.
- Oh, wait a minute!

14:41.320 --> 14:44.600
The last time we ran into
one of these things, we almost lost Sheppard.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.040
How do you expect to just walk right
into one of their nests?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.120
<i>I don't see that we have any other choice.</i>

14:49.160 --> 14:52.280
We need the Eratus stem cells.
The best stem cells come from embryos.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.320
With them, we actually have a chance of saving
Colonel Sheppard. Without them he'll die.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.920
And this is the only option we have?

14:56.960 --> 14:58.520
And time's an issue as well.

15:00.320 --> 15:01.960
You have no idea what will happen.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.320
There's only one certainty.
What will happen if we do nothing.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.440
<i>We all understand the risk, Dr Weir</i>

15:06.480 --> 15:10.120
and I believe that Colonel Sheppard
would do the same for any one of us.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.960
Permission granted.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.720
I need an hour to get my things together.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.360
OK, gear up!
One hour.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.320
Look! I made a new friend!

15:35.920 --> 15:37.120
It's only protocol.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.320
That's your answer for everything.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.120
You look well.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.520
<i>Should you be out of bed?</i>

15:45.920 --> 15:49.320
I was going a little crazy down there,
so they said I could walk around for a bit.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.280
That's good.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.920
Look, I'm trying to say,
I want to go on this mission.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.520
You said yourself,
you're not fit for any offworld activity.

16:03.520 --> 16:09.560
The inhibitor that Beckett's got me on, the one that's
keeping me lucid, they keep having to up the dose.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.320
I know, they told me.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.720
Well, I don't know how much more time I have,

16:13.760 --> 16:19.440
but the last thing I wanna do,
is sit on my mutating hands,

16:19.480 --> 16:23.360
while my team puts their lives on the line,
trying to find me a cure!

16:24.720 --> 16:26.120
I should be with them.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.320
No!
I'm sorry.

16:31.320 --> 16:34.040
What's the worst that could happen.
I'd die?

16:34.080 --> 16:35.520
You could compromise the mission.

16:35.560 --> 16:39.120
- They have enough things to worry about...
- Oh, no, no. So what? Suddenly I'm a liability?

16:39.160 --> 16:41.120
Your condition can change rapidly.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.920
- I know and I know I can do this!
- I am glad you feel that way,

16:44.960 --> 16:48.920
- but it would be irresponsible of me...
- This is my life we're talking about!

16:49.400 --> 16:50.520
I know that.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.320
I'm going on that mission.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.160
No, John, you're not!

16:56.520 --> 16:57.520
Dammit!

17:00.320 --> 17:01.920
It's OK! Put it down!

17:06.319 --> 17:08.119
I'm betting that didn't sell you.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.520
No.
No not really.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.560
I should go back to the infirmary.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.319
Yes.

17:39.420 --> 17:40.620
So, what are we looking for?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.820
Well, according to the Ancient database,
probably a cave.

17:42.860 --> 17:46.620
Cool, damp and dark.
Which I translate, scary, awful, bad.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.300
<i>They wouldn't want their nests out in the open.</i>

17:48.340 --> 17:50.420
The cave keeps the eggs away from predators.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.900
I always figured they were the predator.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.620
I guarantee there's something out there worse.

17:53.660 --> 17:54.460
Really?

17:54.500 --> 17:56.100
They gotta feed on something.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.820
Thank you.
Thank you for that!

17:57.860 --> 17:58.860
You're welcome.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.540
The foot of that mountain range starts
about a mile up this way.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.980
It's probably our best bet for caves.

18:03.020 --> 18:03.780
<i>Agreed!</i>

18:03.820 --> 18:05.180
<i>OK, let's pick up the pace!</i>

18:16.420 --> 18:18.020
What do you think you're doing?

18:18.620 --> 18:20.420
Sergeant? You wanna give us a minute, please?

18:22.620 --> 18:23.780
What's the problem?

18:23.820 --> 18:24.420
<i>This!</i>

18:24.460 --> 18:29.140
This is the problem. Memo to all Atlantis
personnel regarding new security protocols.

18:29.180 --> 18:31.700
Is there a part there that you
disagree with in particular?

18:31.740 --> 18:35.820
You are just keeping Sheppard's chair warm, Colonel.
Don't lose sight of that.

18:35.860 --> 18:39.900
Look, he's done a good job here. There's just
some rookie mistakes that I thought needed fixing.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.420
So you went ahead and changed
them without talking to me.

18:43.620 --> 18:47.340
I don't need to check with you about how I run
the military operations on this base, ma'am.

18:49.020 --> 18:52.620
They tell me you're also thinking
of rearranging the offworld teams.

18:52.660 --> 18:56.500
Again! Sheppard had things a little backwards.
I figured that while I'm here...

18:56.540 --> 18:58.020
Well you figured wrong!

18:59.540 --> 19:02.220
There's no telling when Sheppard's gonna be better.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.420
<i>None of the estimates that I've heard are certain.</i>

19:04.460 --> 19:05.620
On the contrary,

19:06.020 --> 19:09.820
I think I may be doing a little more than
keeping the Colonel's chair warm, ma'am.

19:10.220 --> 19:12.780
<i>I mean, just look at this scheduling,
labour distribution.</i>

19:12.820 --> 19:13.420
I don't need to!

19:13.460 --> 19:14.380
Well somebody needed to.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.260
Do you think I don't know what you're doing?

19:16.300 --> 19:17.900
I'm trying to improve things.

19:17.940 --> 19:21.300
Look, I'm not saying that you're wrong,
or even that I object to all of these changes.

19:21.340 --> 19:23.260
Excuse me?
Because I thought that's exactly...

19:23.300 --> 19:24.580
You could have waited a week

19:25.020 --> 19:26.420
<i>or even a day!</i>

19:26.460 --> 19:29.940
You making sweeping changes to
the way John Sheppard runs things,

19:29.980 --> 19:33.820
just hours after being assigned to this position,
sends only one message!

19:34.420 --> 19:36.020
That he's not coming back.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.860
You think this is it?

19:46.900 --> 19:49.500
It certainly smells like
there's something living in there.

19:49.501 --> 19:50.620
Yeah, or dying.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.220
I cannot see that far into the cave.

19:54.620 --> 19:56.820
Oh, well that is disgusting!

19:58.820 --> 19:59.820
They're in there.

19:59.860 --> 20:03.100
And you had to pick it up
and smell it, to figure that out.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.820
To know it's recent.

20:06.420 --> 20:07.620
Well, how recent?

20:09.020 --> 20:09.940
So what's the plan?

20:09.941 --> 20:11.340
<i>Well, we go in there.</i>

20:11.341 --> 20:14.380
We get some eggs
and then we come out.

20:14.820 --> 20:15.580
OK.

20:15.620 --> 20:19.660
Ronon, Teyla, you're on point with me.
Walker, Stevens, you take our six.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.780
Docs, just...

20:20.781 --> 20:23.260
stay in the middle and try not to get bit, OK?

20:23.300 --> 20:25.180
Well maybe someone should, stay out here.

20:25.181 --> 20:28.220
So that you're all alone when a dozen
of them come stampeding outta here?

20:29.020 --> 20:30.140
I'll be in the middle.

20:31.820 --> 20:33.020
Let's do it!

20:47.020 --> 20:48.260
Hear that?

20:49.820 --> 20:50.580
Yes.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.620
Looks like we got the right address.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.020
You don't seriously think that's gonna help,
do ya?

20:57.060 --> 20:59.780
Yeah well, if they see your neck before mine.
You won't think it's stupid.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.820
Where are these eggs supposed to be?

21:01.860 --> 21:03.820
The database says they have a central nest.

21:03.860 --> 21:05.820
I'm hoping we'll know it when we see it.

21:16.020 --> 21:16.820
John?

21:19.220 --> 21:20.420
<i>Leave them off.</i>

21:21.220 --> 21:22.020
What?

21:22.820 --> 21:25.420
The lights.
Leave the lights off.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.220
OK.

21:30.620 --> 21:33.620
I thought I should come by
and practise my bedside manner.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.420
How are you?

21:37.220 --> 21:40.420
My body's mutating into a bug.
How are you?

21:42.220 --> 21:45.020
Would you like an update
on your team's progress?

21:45.820 --> 21:48.420
They found an Eratus cave
and they've headed in.

21:48.820 --> 21:49.620
Good.

21:49.621 --> 21:52.180
They should locate some eggs
and be back here in no time.

21:52.220 --> 21:52.900
No time.

21:52.940 --> 21:53.740
Yes.

21:53.820 --> 21:54.780
Then what?

21:58.820 --> 22:00.420
Honestly, I don't know.

22:07.820 --> 22:09.420
Are you alright?

22:11.220 --> 22:13.820
- Would you like me to call someone?
- Who would you call?

22:13.860 --> 22:15.300
If you need to see a Doctor.

22:15.340 --> 22:17.620
I need a bigger security detail.

22:18.820 --> 22:19.580
Excuse me?

22:19.620 --> 22:23.820
At least two men stationed at my door,
sooner rather than later.

22:24.420 --> 22:26.020
What are you talking about?

22:26.420 --> 22:28.620
Just trust me Elizabeth,
you're gonna need it.

22:28.621 --> 22:29.820
Listen John...

22:32.220 --> 22:33.420
Oh my God!

22:33.820 --> 22:35.420
They need to hurry.

22:39.420 --> 22:41.460
You should be in the infirmary.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.820
The infirmary isn't secure.

22:45.020 --> 22:49.220
The inhibitor's only keeping me lucid.
It's not slowing the retrovirus.

22:49.420 --> 22:51.820
- Still.
- Don't argue with me!

22:53.620 --> 22:56.220
I'm not safe to be around anymore.

22:57.620 --> 23:00.820
Get some more men on my door
and get the hell out of here.

23:03.220 --> 23:04.220
OK.

23:05.420 --> 23:06.220
<i>OK.</i>

23:12.820 --> 23:14.140
Double the detail.

23:14.180 --> 23:15.420
Code 1-6.

23:35.020 --> 23:36.220
Doc!

23:40.620 --> 23:41.860
Good God!

23:43.820 --> 23:45.020
<i>I think this is it!</i>

23:51.420 --> 23:53.220
So how do we wanna play this?

23:53.260 --> 23:54.820
They'll defend their young.

23:55.420 --> 23:57.020
Maybe we should make a diversion.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.220
Are you volunteering?

24:00.620 --> 24:01.620
I'll shut up.

24:03.020 --> 24:07.420
I do not believe we can get close enough to retrieve
the eggs without these creatures attacking.

24:08.820 --> 24:10.020
I have this.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.420
I need to get under that.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.420
Hand me that water canister.

24:23.220 --> 24:27.420
If there's one thing we knew about these little
buggers, it's that they hate salt water.

24:28.220 --> 24:30.020
How's that gonna help us?

24:31.620 --> 24:32.820
Just watch.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.420
See?
Not so stupid!

24:50.460 --> 24:51.900
Shut up!

25:07.220 --> 25:08.620
Doc...

25:10.300 --> 25:11.540
We've come this far.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.340
Head's up!

25:18.180 --> 25:19.460
Carson, run!

25:27.460 --> 25:30.300
<i>Let's go! Come on!
Get out of here! Don't look back!</i>

25:30.780 --> 25:32.220
<i>Don't look back, come on!</i>

25:32.940 --> 25:35.620
Walker, Stevens!
Get the hell out of there!

25:36.940 --> 25:38.620
Walker, Stevens, do you copy?

25:40.620 --> 25:42.340
Fire in the hole!

25:42.380 --> 25:43.580
<i>Let's go!</i>

25:53.060 --> 25:54.420
I think that stopped them.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.740
We're not sticking around to find out.
I'm pulling the plug on this mission.

25:58.780 --> 25:59.980
Let's get back to the gate.

26:00.020 --> 26:00.940
We can't give up!

26:00.980 --> 26:03.020
We just lost two men in there, Doc!

26:03.021 --> 26:05.860
So unless you can find another way to get
those eggs out of there, we're done!

26:06.580 --> 26:07.420
Understand?

26:08.020 --> 26:08.820
Let's go!

26:22.320 --> 26:25.440
The nest is incredibly well protected.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of 'em.

26:25.441 --> 26:26.960
I just don't think it's possible.

26:26.961 --> 26:28.160
So, where is that leave us?

26:28.680 --> 26:33.520
Without the stem cells,
our plan is not promising.

26:36.020 --> 26:37.020
OK,

26:38.820 --> 26:40.020
I'll tell him.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.080
How is he?

26:53.280 --> 26:54.520
I wouldn't go in there, ma'am.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.200
I'll be fine.

27:05.920 --> 27:06.760
John?

27:18.080 --> 27:21.100
So this is when I usually
ask you a stupid question.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.520
Like, how are you feeling?

27:26.720 --> 27:27.920
John?

27:29.920 --> 27:31.120
John?

27:36.120 --> 27:38.200
Our team got back from the mission.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.920
The nest was too well protected.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.280
We were unable to retrieve the eggs.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.760
- They tried their best.
- Best?

27:53.080 --> 27:55.040
- The bugs attacked.
- Try again.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.760
- I can't do that.
- Why?

28:00.960 --> 28:01.920
- John.
- No.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.280
- I understand...
- If you won't, then kill me now.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.720
- John!
- It's better for the both of us.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.600
I can't do that.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.840
Then try again.

28:32.240 --> 28:37.000
We lost Walker and Stevens!
I won't send another team!

28:37.800 --> 28:39.600
I won't risk more lives!

28:51.680 --> 28:56.720
This is Weir! We have a security breach!
Colonel Sheppard's quarters.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.320
<i>OK, we got a lock on him.</i>

29:08.980 --> 29:11.300
That can't be him,
it's moving too fast.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.160
It's him.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.720
<i>Alright. Four teams. Surround him
and close in. I want him stopped.</i>

29:16.920 --> 29:19.720
And gentlemen, use whatever level of
force you deem necessary.

29:19.920 --> 29:20.920
Move out.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.920
You will only use such force as a last resort.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.440
That's not Sheppard anymore, ma'am.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.360
You heard me.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.320
You coming?

29:37.920 --> 29:38.680
Yes.

29:42.960 --> 29:43.840
Lock down the Stargate.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.540
I thought you said that
he couldn't use the transporters?

30:00.580 --> 30:03.060
I said, I doubted he was lucid enough.

30:03.100 --> 30:04.700
Well shut 'em down.
He's not going to do it again.

30:04.740 --> 30:05.860
Thus stranding your search teams.

30:08.420 --> 30:11.820
<i>Bravo team you're on deck.
While Tango is on the floor right below you.</i>

30:11.860 --> 30:13.900
You heard the man!
Down the stairs.

30:16.300 --> 30:17.900
Ronon, where are you going?

30:17.940 --> 30:18.820
Let him go.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.220
Bravo team and Sheppard are in the same room.

30:38.221 --> 30:40.300
Stay sharp, he should be right in there with you.

31:02.220 --> 31:03.380
Anyone have a visual?

31:08.020 --> 31:08.940
Above us!

31:25.340 --> 31:26.340
Colonel!

31:29.500 --> 31:32.940
Please, do not make me do this.

31:48.020 --> 31:49.820
Get the Doctor down here.

31:50.060 --> 31:51.180
<i>I have him.</i>

32:03.220 --> 32:06.940
I've put him in a medically induced coma, for now.
I was afraid he might break through the restraints.

32:06.980 --> 32:07.860
That's a good call, Doctor.

32:07.900 --> 32:09.100
So what now?

32:09.460 --> 32:12.420
The retrovirus has wreaked havoc
on his system and it's taking over.

32:12.460 --> 32:13.460
What does that mean?

32:13.700 --> 32:16.820
It means, if we don't find a way to
stop the retrovirus in the next 24 hours,

32:18.060 --> 32:20.180
what's left of the John Sheppard
we know will be gone.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.380
You guys are up late.

32:37.060 --> 32:38.700
Can't sleep either?

32:39.980 --> 32:40.940
Any progress?

32:41.680 --> 32:44.720
No. He's still in a coma.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.560
At least he isn't in any pain.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.560
Maybe if I went alone. Maybe...

32:50.600 --> 32:52.160
It's not open for discussion.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.680
I'm not good at sitting still.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.920
I understand.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.800
<i>Believe me,
I appreciate how you feel.</i>

33:01.760 --> 33:05.280
Look, we have closed down that section
of the infirmary, but if you feel the need to...

33:10.040 --> 33:14.920
What I mean to say is,
if you would like to have a private goodbye,

33:15.320 --> 33:17.320
you should probably do it soon.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.040
Are we really there?

33:22.400 --> 33:23.480
I think we might be.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.560
<i>Dr Weir, I need to speak to you immediately.</i>

33:27.640 --> 33:28.440
<i>What is it?</i>

33:28.480 --> 33:30.200
Meet me in your office.
I think I have an idea.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.640
I'm sorry, it just came to me.

33:39.680 --> 33:43.440
The fact that his mutation is progressed
as far as it has, may be his salvation.

33:43.441 --> 33:44.680
Explain that.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.920
His sweat glands are actually producing
trace amounts of their signature pheromone.

33:48.480 --> 33:48.960
And?

33:49.520 --> 33:52.280
When we were in the cave,
those bugs knew we didn't belong there.

33:52.281 --> 33:54.800
So they didn't really fancy
us getting close to their nest.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.240
I see where you're going with this.

33:56.241 --> 33:57.920
If we can artificially create the pheromone,

33:57.960 --> 34:00.000
we might be able to confuse them
enough to leave us alone.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.440
Aye, that would work.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.000
Well, that's an excellent plan, Carson!

34:03.001 --> 34:04.000
I wish it was!

34:04.440 --> 34:05.920
You can't do that, Doc?

34:05.921 --> 34:07.080
No, it'd take days.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.320
<i>But you said Sheppard only had 24 hours</i>

34:09.360 --> 34:11.760
before the damage the retrovirus
was causing would be irreparable.

34:11.800 --> 34:12.480
Exactly.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.080
Well then, that's a terrible plan, Carson.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.520
There's only one person on this base
that wouldn't need the artificial pheromone.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.080
Sheppard?

34:20.120 --> 34:22.840
He could walk right in that cave and
those bugs wouldn't pay him any mind.

34:22.880 --> 34:26.360
I'm not sure if you noticed or not,
but, Colonel Sheppard's not feeling very well.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.159
He stopped taking the inhibitor we were administering.
It was able to keep him lucid.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.920
I thought it's effectiveness had worn off.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.480
<i>True.</i>

34:31.520 --> 34:33.040
But I believe if we give him a massive dose,

34:33.080 --> 34:36.080
he may be clear headed enough to complete
the mission before we lose him completely.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.760
Yeah, but won't giving him
the natural inhibitor, like...

34:37.800 --> 34:38.600
<i>Kill him.</i>

34:38.639 --> 34:40.920
<i>Yes, it's a definite possibility.</i>

34:40.960 --> 34:42.719
Even if I knew it would for certain,

34:42.760 --> 34:45.920
I'd be tempted to offer him
one last hour of lucidity.

34:47.639 --> 34:48.760
Do it.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.440
Gear up.
Take him as far as the cave.

35:00.960 --> 35:01.840
John?

35:03.440 --> 35:04.320
<i>John!</i>

35:09.240 --> 35:11.240
You're in the infirmary.

35:11.800 --> 35:15.240
Sorry about the headache.
It's a side effect of the inhibitor.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.720
Did I hurt anyone?

35:18.600 --> 35:20.040
No, not seriously.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.520
Did Ronon shoot me?

35:23.480 --> 35:24.760
You had it coming.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.200
<i>Look, we don't have a lot of time.</i>

35:27.240 --> 35:30.040
This dose of the inhibitor drug
will only last about an hour.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.040
How would you like to go on a mission?

35:38.040 --> 35:40.720
- Now you realise that you may have to...
- It's already set to stun.

35:47.800 --> 35:48.760
He's ready.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.920
Ah! Good to see you up and...

35:52.440 --> 35:53.280
about.

35:54.160 --> 35:56.120
Alright, come on.
We don't have a lot of time.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.000
Good luck.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.120
Use this and collect as many as you can.

36:17.920 --> 36:21.040
Oh God. At least a container full.
Do you understand?

36:26.360 --> 36:27.560
<i>Colonel Sheppard?</i>

36:27.600 --> 36:30.200
You know that we cannot go in there
with you, but you need to hurry.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.720
It took us a little longer to get here,
than we would have liked.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.480
What is that?

37:44.840 --> 37:47.400
That's how long
I estimated the inhibitor would work.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.400
So that means he's...

37:49.440 --> 37:50.760
There's no way to know for certain.

38:14.840 --> 38:15.760
We should go in.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.520
And do what?

38:17.560 --> 38:19.160
If the inhibitor has worn off...

38:19.200 --> 38:20.520
Then he's beyond our help.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.960
I hear something.

38:24.520 --> 38:25.560
Colonel!

38:34.240 --> 38:36.080
- Do you have enough?
- Aye, I think so.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.920
It's not going to happen overnight.
You can bet on that.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.520
But the transformation
has begun to reverse itself.

38:52.521 --> 38:54.480
So eventually, he'll be back in uniform.

38:54.520 --> 38:55.240
Eventually.

38:55.241 --> 38:58.680
Well done Carson, for once again
elevating medicine to actual science!

38:58.720 --> 39:00.040
Oh, thank you, Rodney.

39:00.041 --> 39:03.120
You'll finally be able to get some sleep.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.760
- Keep me posted.
- Alright.

39:07.080 --> 39:07.880
<i>We might...</i>

39:07.920 --> 39:09.160
Stay a while.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.800
Well, if that's alright.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.200
Of course.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.000
If and when Colonel Sheppard
resumes his duties,

39:22.080 --> 39:24.400
I hope you'll consider some
of the changes that I've made.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.000
When he does,
that will be up to him.

39:26.040 --> 39:28.480
Of course. The Daedalus will head
back to Earth in less than a week.

39:28.560 --> 39:29.720
I'll be out of your hair in no time.

39:29.760 --> 39:31.760
Well, we'll try and manage
without you, till you get back.

39:32.360 --> 39:35.160
<i>Despite what you might think
about my intentions, Dr Weir.</i>

39:36.320 --> 39:37.560
I'm not your enemy.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.160
Believe me Colonel,
you don't wanna be.

39:51.200 --> 39:56.760
Caught, lift, lock, serpentine,
lock and hold. Understood?

39:57.520 --> 39:58.600
Colonel!

40:06.480 --> 40:08.720
Should you be up and about?

40:08.760 --> 40:12.680
I've been cooped up in that damn infirmary
for a couple of weeks. Give me a break.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.280
<i>You are looking well.</i>

40:16.560 --> 40:18.880
Are you feeling more like yourself?

40:19.360 --> 40:22.720
Well, according to my DNA,
I'm 100% John Sheppard.

40:23.720 --> 40:29.320
Although, I gotta say, I'm looking
forward to getting rid of this thing one day.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.040
Doc says it'll clear up eventually.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.520
So listen.

40:35.880 --> 40:39.960
While I've been laying there the past few weeks,
I've been remembering things.

40:41.120 --> 40:45.400
Some things I might have done
that you could call out of character.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.320
You mean, when you attacked
the security detail.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.320
That was one of them.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.400
Yes.

40:52.440 --> 40:56.720
There's another thing
I should probably apologise for.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.000
Give it no further thought.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.520
Good!

41:01.240 --> 41:02.240
I won't.

41:03.240 --> 41:04.920
Nice to have you back.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.560
John.
