14:37.510 --> 14:40.113
[laughs]
Yeah.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.148
Oh, yes. Here we go.

14:44.517 --> 14:49.922
Let fate run its course
like the blood in their veins!

14:49.956 --> 14:53.493
Have you made your peace
with your maker?

14:53.526 --> 14:55.495
I've got things I still have
to do.

14:55.528 --> 14:59.132
Yeah, me too and
I'm gonna end you.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.333
(Darius) Here she goes.
Here she goes.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.902
Where it stops nobody knows.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.238
Oh.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.509
The haladie.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.544
The haladie.

15:12.044 --> 15:16.949
Twice as nice because
it's got twice the slice.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.085
Are my combatants ready?

15:19.118 --> 15:21.020
Showtime.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.091
Begin.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.502
No.

15:37.603 --> 15:42.742
No! Where you goin'?
You're not getting away from me.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.378
[fighting grunts]

15:45.411 --> 15:46.913
Dumb move, kid.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.514
That was your last.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.219
Remember the soft spots!

15:53.252 --> 15:54.620
Shut your mouth!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.691
[groans]

16:01.594 --> 16:03.396
How's that for a soft spot?

16:03.429 --> 16:06.132
[laughs]
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

16:06.165 --> 16:08.534
Right in the... ball sack.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.703
[growls]

16:14.073 --> 16:23.316
[fighting grunts]

16:23.349 --> 16:24.750
Oh, no, no.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.286
Ohhhhh!!!!!

16:32.458 --> 16:34.293
It's not the size of the dog
in the fight

16:34.327 --> 16:36.362
but the fight of the dog in the‐
blah, blah, blah.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.463
You know.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.006
Come here!

16:48.140 --> 16:52.044
You see that? That's not gonna
help you, little girl.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.213
Get outta there!

16:56.482 --> 16:58.217
Move, move, move, move!

16:59.485 --> 17:03.022
[fighting grunts]

17:12.198 --> 17:13.366
It doesn't have
to end this way.

17:13.399 --> 17:15.268
It always ends this way.

17:15.301 --> 17:19.238
I promise, I won't let
you suffer.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.711
I told you I wanted a challenge!

17:26.779 --> 17:27.647
Come on, Vi.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.481
He's too big.

17:28.514 --> 17:29.549
Improvise.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.562
[coughs]

17:42.595 --> 17:44.263
Ooh.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.572
[groans]

17:59.545 --> 18:01.314
I'm sorry.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.282
I'm so sorry.

18:03.716 --> 18:04.684
No.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.586
No.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.121
I can't die.

18:17.663 --> 18:19.198
I'm sorry.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.501
You said if I got‐

18:22.535 --> 18:29.141
if I got 20 wins...
I could leave.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.344
Find my family.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.420
It's over!

18:41.454 --> 18:42.455
Okay?

18:42.488 --> 18:45.324
We put on a show
just like you asked!

18:46.459 --> 18:51.931
Yes, but you've left out
the best part.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.633
One second.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.068
Uh, here we go.
Here we go.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.236
Here we go.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.904
Here, here, here.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.144
Finish him.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.283
I'm no executioner.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.785
Aren't you?

19:20.793 --> 19:23.663
You son of a bitch.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.930
We had a deal.

19:24.964 --> 19:28.601
Which you failed to live up to.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.637
I'll see you in hell.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.447
[Darius laughs]

19:41.480 --> 19:42.448
What a show.

19:42.481 --> 19:43.482
What an upset!

19:43.516 --> 19:47.453
Sadly, the Slayer did not
live up to her name,

19:47.486 --> 19:50.723
but I'm sure she'll learn
soon enough.

19:50.756 --> 19:53.359
For now, toodle‐oo,
my lovelies.

19:53.392 --> 19:56.328
Toodle‐oo, my lovelies,
till next time!

19:56.362 --> 19:57.530
Till next time!

19:57.563 --> 20:00.533
[laughs]

20:00.566 --> 20:03.969
And cameras are cut.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.639
You will learn
to take direction.

20:06.672 --> 20:07.840
Or what?

20:07.873 --> 20:13.312
Oh, the show goes on, but
it's you that gets cancelled.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.226
[spits]

20:31.063 --> 20:34.567
So these, um, pages.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.369
What do they do, exactly?

20:37.403 --> 20:40.673
They open the portal to where
Vanessa and the Dark One went.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.442
I think.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.845
And you actually
saw the Dark One?

20:48.714 --> 20:52.418
If it weren't for Vanessa.

20:52.451 --> 20:54.687
We'll find your sister.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.689
Damn right we will.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.391
[laughs]

20:59.425 --> 21:01.627
You probably are her daughter.

21:04.363 --> 21:05.998
You two were close?

21:07.733 --> 21:11.971
In our own way, I guess.

21:12.004 --> 21:15.708
Not sure if I ever really
knew her.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.810
It was the weight of what
she was, you know?

21:17.843 --> 21:20.880
She‐ the things she had to do,
what people expected of her.

21:20.913 --> 21:25.851
Just... cast a big shadow.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.392
She tried to do good,

21:34.994 --> 21:36.028
even if it meant
doing some things

21:36.061 --> 21:38.864
that people couldn't live with.

21:44.937 --> 21:51.911
She was fierce,
she was determined,

21:51.944 --> 21:53.879
but she loved her daughter
more than just about anything

21:53.913 --> 21:55.648
on the planet.

21:57.883 --> 21:58.751
Probably would have
loved you, too,

21:58.784 --> 22:00.786
if she had the chance.

22:04.690 --> 22:09.061
Well, that's all we're gonna
get out of that.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.665
Feels like we were
just getting started.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.601
Yeah, well.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.603
I'm gonna get her back.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.605
Me and my sister.

22:19.638 --> 22:24.944
And then together we'll put
an end to all of them.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.693
(Tape) ...but I am sure
she will learn soon enough.

22:46.665 --> 22:47.366
[knocking]

22:47.399 --> 22:49.702
Entrez‐vous, s'il vous plait.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.174
I had such high hopes for you.

22:55.207 --> 22:59.645
But clearly one of us
got ahead of ourselves.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.115
Mmm.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.052
Sweet, sweet Slayer.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.421
My name is Violet.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.156
I don't care.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.697
Why are you doing this?

23:18.731 --> 23:19.632
Good times or bad,

23:19.665 --> 23:21.934
people always need
entertainment, my dear.

23:21.967 --> 23:22.968
What people?

23:23.002 --> 23:24.536
Where?

23:24.570 --> 23:26.005
I would be more concerned

23:26.038 --> 23:29.008
with what is happening
right here, Slayer.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.176
Stop calling me that.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.712
Someone is supposed to die!

23:33.746 --> 23:35.414
You broke that rule.

23:35.447 --> 23:36.849
Argh!

23:36.882 --> 23:39.551
Rules maintain order.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.720
Without them there is chaos.

23:41.754 --> 23:42.655
Not unlike the wastelands

23:42.688 --> 23:44.957
you've been trying
to survive out there.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.325
And in here?

23:46.358 --> 23:51.497
Chaos is a shit show
you call entertainment.

23:51.530 --> 23:57.870
Breaking the rules
usually means death,

23:57.903 --> 24:00.739
but I like your spunk.

24:00.773 --> 24:04.877
And my audience deserves to see
your full potential,

24:04.910 --> 24:08.047
so I'm giving you
another chance.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.649
Colour me merciful.

24:11.483 --> 24:13.652
I won't kill for you.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.121
You haven't even heard
what I have to offer you.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.256
It doesn't matter.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.090
Really?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.658
Really.

24:24.296 --> 24:28.133
Become my ultimate champion
and I will send you

24:28.167 --> 24:32.171
to a place unaffected
by vampires,

24:32.204 --> 24:35.607
where everyone will cheer
your name

24:35.641 --> 24:38.610
and you will never live
in fear again.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.546
Shangri‐La.

24:42.781 --> 24:44.616
That doesn't exist.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.285
Really?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.754
Who do you think is watching?

24:50.789 --> 24:52.758
You don't have any choice,
Slayer.

24:52.791 --> 24:56.895
You either murder for the masses
or it's off with your head.

24:56.929 --> 24:57.596
Good.

24:57.629 --> 24:58.931
Good chat, thank you.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.766
Take her away.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.769
I won't kill innocent people
just to save myself!

25:03.802 --> 25:06.038
You hear me?

25:06.071 --> 25:09.308
You will, Slayer.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.243
They all do.

25:17.149 --> 25:22.821
[laughing]

25:22.855 --> 25:24.623
Ouch.

25:24.656 --> 25:28.127
What a come from behind victory,
folks!

25:28.160 --> 25:30.162
I could have done
without the tears,

25:30.195 --> 25:32.798
but there's something about
a snivelling coward

25:32.831 --> 25:36.035
turning ruthless killer that
really gets my blood flowing.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.970
[laughing]

25:38.003 --> 25:39.738
Wooo!

25:39.772 --> 25:41.807
They made me kill her.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.175
I didn't want to.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.611
I didn't want to!

25:46.011 --> 25:47.546
[Darius mocking]
I didn't want to!

25:47.579 --> 25:48.147
I didn't want to!

25:48.180 --> 25:49.648
You made me do it!

25:49.681 --> 25:51.750
I had to do it.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.986
Guilty, you did have to do it.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.988
I didn't want to.

25:56.021 --> 25:57.856
They made me.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.092
I had to do it.

26:00.125 --> 26:04.997
And we'll be right back
after this short break.

26:05.030 --> 26:05.731
(Director) Cut!

26:05.764 --> 26:06.832
Good, are we cut?

26:06.865 --> 26:08.133
Good.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.769
(Julius) I say we risk it.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.705
I'll take the brunt of the fire
while you take him out.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.174
No need.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.076
I have an idea.

26:19.111 --> 26:22.014
(Violet) Get your big hands
off me, you ape!

26:22.047 --> 26:24.716
I'm gonna kill you,
you little runt!

26:24.750 --> 26:26.318
(Guard) You two, knock it off!

26:28.053 --> 26:29.254
Get them outta there!

26:29.288 --> 26:32.257
They're no good to me if they
kill each other off camera!

26:33.058 --> 26:34.159
Let's go.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.295
I'm gonna rip your face off!

26:36.328 --> 26:37.729
I'm gonna kill you,
you little runt!

26:37.763 --> 26:38.797
I am going to get you first!

26:38.831 --> 26:40.032
I'm gonna end you!

26:40.065 --> 26:41.033
I'm gonna end your face!

26:41.066 --> 26:41.967
I'm gonna end you!

26:42.000 --> 26:44.937
Spit on you and spit
on your corpse!

26:45.771 --> 26:47.406
[laughing]

26:47.439 --> 26:48.407
Easy, Slayer.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.074
Easy, Slayer.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.276
You'll get your chance.

26:52.911 --> 26:54.213
Change the fight card.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.747
These two go next.

26:55.781 --> 26:56.949
(Director) Yes, sir.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.998
The compass says...

27:14.733 --> 27:16.435
she must be in there.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.972
I only see two of them
but they're like roaches.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.574
You know there's more inside.

27:22.608 --> 27:23.809
What is this place?

27:23.842 --> 27:25.511
I don't know.

27:25.544 --> 27:28.480
But I bet they get shit reviews
on Yelp.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.584
Hey! Where are you going?!

27:32.618 --> 27:33.886
To rescue Violet.

27:33.919 --> 27:36.088
Not without a plan,
you're not.

27:36.121 --> 27:38.790
Bullets might not kill us
but they hurt like hell.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.726
Those are four gauge shotgun
shells those guys are carrying.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.895
They'll take your
head clean off.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.664
Ain't no healing from that.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.234
So what's the plan?

27:49.268 --> 27:51.170
I'm thinking.

27:53.639 --> 27:54.640
Anytime now‐

27:54.673 --> 27:56.608
Okay, okay, look.
We're gonna get your sister.

27:56.642 --> 27:57.676
Here's how.

27:57.709 --> 27:58.744
There's two guards, right?

27:58.777 --> 28:00.145
Here and here.

28:04.750 --> 28:08.921
I ghost around the
fence line, distract them,
do a little jazz hands.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.656
You sneak around here...

28:10.689 --> 28:12.658
[distant screams]

28:12.691 --> 28:17.696
[screams]

28:24.803 --> 28:26.538
Okay, new plan.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.109
We follow them.

28:33.912 --> 28:37.683
Welcome back, my lovelies!
Oh, ho, ho!

28:37.716 --> 28:41.587
You know, I'm feeling a little,
uh, naughty this evening.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.590
Maybe it's something in the air.

28:44.623 --> 28:49.161
But next up I bring you
the rarest of occurrences.

28:49.194 --> 28:51.964
You know her,
you love her.

28:51.997 --> 28:54.166
In her second match
of the evening here

28:54.199 --> 29:00.672
to slay yet another giant,
the Slayer!

29:00.706 --> 29:01.873
Yes.

29:01.907 --> 29:07.879
And her opponent, the hulking
brute from parts unknown,

29:07.913 --> 29:09.848
the Yeti.

29:11.116 --> 29:14.086
Let the games begin,
shall we?

29:17.055 --> 29:19.825
Round and round she spins,

29:19.858 --> 29:26.732
where she stops
will split your skin.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.767
[clatter]

29:30.269 --> 29:33.272
Ok, now um, you two don't
play nice, now.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.007
Wink, wink.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.942
And go!

29:38.877 --> 29:42.681
Ooh, and the Slayer
draws first blood.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.716
[growls]

29:46.385 --> 29:47.786
Hey!

29:49.388 --> 29:51.623
[screams]

29:54.793 --> 29:58.130
[growling]

29:58.730 --> 30:01.333
At least they're taking care of
the hard part for us.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.171
I hate to tell ya, eventually
they are the hard part.

30:08.907 --> 30:09.908
Watch your step.

30:11.877 --> 30:12.944
[spits]

30:16.882 --> 30:17.516
Ouch.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.284
Little bit of a left hook.

30:21.853 --> 30:23.221
Let's do this.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.827
Come on!

30:29.428 --> 30:30.829
Boring.

30:30.862 --> 30:31.997
[laughter sounds]

30:32.030 --> 30:33.732
Come on!

30:34.266 --> 30:35.701
I can't.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.436
Do it.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.171
Or we're gonna die.

30:39.204 --> 30:41.006
Let's go!

30:43.942 --> 30:45.844
[charging cries]

30:52.150 --> 30:53.785
Okay, okay, okay.

30:53.819 --> 30:55.187
Pause.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.788
Wait.

30:58.824 --> 31:01.793
Time to even the playing field.

31:01.827 --> 31:03.929
Timber!

31:03.962 --> 31:05.430
[clatter]

31:11.403 --> 31:12.971
[charging cries]

31:14.339 --> 31:17.943
Yeti down, ladies and gentlemen.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.413
It's now or never, kid.

31:33.158 --> 31:35.227
Kill her!

31:40.966 --> 31:42.267
[gunshot]

31:54.446 --> 31:55.781
[clapping]

31:55.814 --> 31:57.315
Wonderful.

31:57.349 --> 31:58.917
Bravo, Slayer.

31:58.950 --> 32:01.386
Show's over, psycho!

32:03.121 --> 32:04.956
Au contraire.

32:04.990 --> 32:08.326
It would appear that the show
has just begun.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.295
[screaming]

32:12.964 --> 32:14.499
[screaming]

32:19.404 --> 32:21.072
No.

32:21.506 --> 32:24.209
I killed you in Denver!

32:25.076 --> 32:28.146
Only your love died there.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.247
No!

32:29.281 --> 32:32.617
[gunshots]

32:34.586 --> 32:39.291
[gunshots]

32:39.691 --> 32:41.259
[clicking]

32:41.293 --> 32:42.561
Scab!!!

32:44.396 --> 32:47.098
This time I'm gonna make sure
you die.

32:49.835 --> 32:52.137
With my bare hands.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.378
[screaming]

33:02.781 --> 33:03.882
Julius!

33:06.117 --> 33:08.286
Sorry, kid.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.355
This one's personal.

33:12.324 --> 33:17.729
You, you will not escape
this time, Van Helsing!

33:19.431 --> 33:21.566
Argh!!!!!

33:21.600 --> 33:24.436
[fighting grunts]

33:36.648 --> 33:42.387
[fighting grunts]

33:43.455 --> 33:44.556
Vi!

33:44.589 --> 33:45.857
Jack!

33:46.791 --> 33:49.227
[growling]

33:56.568 --> 33:59.170
[evil laugh]

33:59.204 --> 34:00.338
Don't shoot!

34:00.372 --> 34:02.541
He has the amulet!

34:05.377 --> 34:07.579
I'm on it!

34:07.612 --> 34:09.814
Looks like that's my cue,
my lovelies.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.816
To be continued.

34:17.689 --> 34:18.690
Julius?

34:20.625 --> 34:21.927
Axel!

34:21.960 --> 34:26.398
[screaming]

34:27.799 --> 34:29.467
No, no, no, no, no!

34:29.501 --> 34:31.269
He's mine!

34:31.703 --> 34:33.338
If you say so.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.207
I suppose you've got
this covered, too, huh?

34:37.342 --> 34:38.810
Go help my sister!

34:39.711 --> 34:41.713
Good luck, big guy.

34:58.363 --> 34:59.464
Hey, asshole!

35:06.471 --> 35:07.339
[cocks gun]

35:07.372 --> 35:08.239
Down!

35:08.273 --> 35:09.674
[gunshots]

35:15.280 --> 35:19.451
[fighting grunts]

35:29.828 --> 35:35.567
[fighting grunts]

36:00.058 --> 36:02.494
This is gold.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.532
[fighting grunts]

36:14.439 --> 36:16.608
[screeching]

36:35.593 --> 36:37.629
[screaming]

36:42.600 --> 36:46.337
[screaming]

36:56.548 --> 37:00.518
You know what I wanna hear!

37:00.552 --> 37:04.756
I'll never say it!

37:04.789 --> 37:06.357
Damn right you won't.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.426
[screams]

37:12.397 --> 37:16.601
[screaming]

37:16.634 --> 37:18.570
[screaming]

37:29.514 --> 37:32.717
You're gonna pay for that,
human!

37:32.751 --> 37:33.918
[screams]

37:42.160 --> 37:45.396
[fighting grunts]

37:50.735 --> 37:51.903
Julius!

37:57.208 --> 38:01.079
I hope your vengeance
was worth your life.

38:03.181 --> 38:07.418
[screaming]

38:24.936 --> 38:32.043
[vomiting]

38:58.870 --> 39:03.942
[laughing and sobbing]

39:03.975 --> 39:08.746
[laughing and sobbing]
I'm... I'm...

39:08.780 --> 39:10.782
[laughing and sobbing]
...Human

39:17.589 --> 39:18.990
Just give us the amulet.

39:19.023 --> 39:19.791
And then what?

39:19.824 --> 39:22.961
You're just gonna let me
walk away?

39:22.994 --> 39:24.729
(Axel) Now you're getting it.

39:24.762 --> 39:28.299
That's not exactly
must see TV, people.

39:28.499 --> 39:29.567
Come and get it!

39:29.601 --> 39:30.602
[gunshots]

39:32.670 --> 39:34.639
Can't believe we're negotiating
with a moron

39:34.672 --> 39:36.908
in the goddamn apocalypse.

39:38.776 --> 39:41.246
Oh, hey. Nice of you to join us.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.755
I see you've been busy.

39:58.529 --> 39:59.297
Yeah.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.766
Why kill when I can save?

40:02.433 --> 40:05.169
What're you gonna do
about her?

40:05.637 --> 40:07.272
I got this.

40:07.705 --> 40:08.373
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.708
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.843
Look at me.

40:11.876 --> 40:15.613
I've been where you are.

40:15.647 --> 40:18.483
I've just spent such a long time
in darkness.

40:18.516 --> 40:21.019
I know.

40:21.052 --> 40:25.556
The Van Helsings have
my loyalty for freeing me.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.559
Come on.

40:31.629 --> 40:32.630
Are we good?

40:32.664 --> 40:33.598
Yeah.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.800
She's with us now.

40:37.602 --> 40:38.836
So what's the plan?

40:38.870 --> 40:42.640
He's locked himself in his room
and he's throwing a tantrum.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.311
Did you ever play football?

40:50.915 --> 40:55.586
Well, my lovelies, it appears
that this may be the end

40:55.620 --> 40:57.889
but I can assure you I won't be
signing off without a‐

40:57.922 --> 41:01.726
a big finale, like when
Edward R. Murrow

41:01.759 --> 41:03.895
wished you a goodnight,
and good luck.

41:03.928 --> 41:07.565
Or when Sam Malone uttered
those immortal words

41:07.598 --> 41:10.034
"sorry, we're closed".

41:10.068 --> 41:14.539
No, this will be TV history.

41:14.572 --> 41:17.976
[laughs]

41:22.613 --> 41:24.916
Don't mind me, I'm just
passing through.

41:27.986 --> 41:31.689
Whatever this is,
just make it good.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.762
Three, two, one.

41:37.795 --> 41:43.835
[gunfire]

41:50.842 --> 41:51.943
Let's go!

42:22.607 --> 42:25.576
Whoever's watching
this disgusting shit,

42:25.610 --> 42:28.446
you're the problem.

42:28.479 --> 42:30.181
You call this entertainment?

42:30.214 --> 42:32.984
You watch real people suffer
just so you can feel better

42:33.017 --> 42:35.653
about your own pathetic lives.

42:35.686 --> 42:42.627
We're fighting to save humanity,
so this ends now.

42:42.660 --> 42:43.594
Show's over, mother‐

42:45.396 --> 42:46.497
As you can see,
the rumours of the woman

42:46.531 --> 42:50.735
who can turn vampires human
are true.

42:50.768 --> 42:54.405
How would you like to proceed,
Madam President?
