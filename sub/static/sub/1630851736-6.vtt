09:24.565 --> 09:26.233
unless you're in Asia?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.277
And I'm sure I've imagined
what that flavor was like,

09:28.277 --> 09:30.070
maybe there were
some Mexican elements in there

09:30.070 --> 09:31.154
'cause it's LA.
Right.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.615
It's an amalgamation of all the things.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.034
It's where food is going to go regardless.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.494
It's what we're eating right now.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.496
- This is Malaysian/
- Singaporean.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.415
When I was there, I was like,

09:41.415 --> 09:42.958
"Oh, this is what would happen
if you merge

09:42.958 --> 09:45.836
<i>"Indian culture with Chinese culture</i>

09:45.836 --> 09:47.296
<i>"with the indigenous people,</i>

09:47.296 --> 09:48.964
<i>that's what that food would be."</i>

09:49.631 --> 09:50.424
<i>The future's here.</i>

09:54.678 --> 09:57.389
<i>Migration is also climate caused.</i>

09:57.389 --> 09:59.600
The UN says by 2050,

09:59.600 --> 10:03.353
two hundred million people are gonna be
made into migrants by climate change.

10:03.353 --> 10:07.107
‐ If you have all of these people
going all over the world now,

10:07.107 --> 10:08.150
'cause they're gonna have to,

10:08.150 --> 10:11.069
I think food's gonna get
crazy interesting.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.906
Part of me is very excited about that.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.366
That sounds so fucked up, I know.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.703
<i>Don't be ashamed, Dave.</i>

10:19.703 --> 10:21.330
<i>Now you're thinking like an AI.</i>

10:21.330 --> 10:23.165
<i>And the cross‐pollination
you've been talking about</i>

10:23.165 --> 10:25.250
<i>has been happening for a long time.</i>

10:25.250 --> 10:28.378
‐ Places that have
a real hodgepodge of culture

10:28.378 --> 10:29.796
and different people and immigrants,

10:29.796 --> 10:31.590
people are gonna
merge these things together

10:31.590 --> 10:33.133
and that's how you get something new.

10:33.550 --> 10:37.346
<i>I've always thought Caribbean food
represents the future food.</i>

10:37.721 --> 10:39.181
<i>Where are you gonna get a mixture,</i>

10:39.181 --> 10:41.058
<i>oftentimes against people's wills,</i>

10:41.058 --> 10:43.810
<i>mixture of flavors
from around the world really?</i>

10:48.065 --> 10:49.358
<i>One example of this in the wild</i>

10:49.358 --> 10:50.734
<i>is happening Down Under.</i>

10:51.235 --> 10:54.112
<i>Chef Paul Carmichael,
originally from Barbados,</i>

10:54.112 --> 10:57.324
<i>is mixing his own history and flavors
with those of Australia.</i>

10:57.324 --> 11:00.035
<i>A country most known
for its overly salty abominations.</i>

11:03.830 --> 11:05.832
<i>I like to call Caribbean food</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:07.835
<i>the ultimate fusion food.</i>

11:07.835 --> 11:09.878
<i>I like to say 500 years of fusion.</i>

11:10.587 --> 11:13.966
Growing up in Barbados,
uh, my mum used to cook this thing

11:13.966 --> 11:15.509
for breakfast all the time.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.345
And it was this frizzy salted cod,

11:18.345 --> 11:20.430
and it's something
that was very important to me

11:20.430 --> 11:23.517
but also like stuck
in my memory all these years.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.519
‐ Is salt cod like a day's ingredients

11:25.519 --> 11:27.938
that you would just see
all the time or like wh‐‐

11:27.938 --> 11:31.108
‐ Yeah, so, I mean,
cod came through the Caribbean

11:31.108 --> 11:33.861
<i>as the colonials
came through the Caribbean</i>

11:33.861 --> 11:36.154
while they raped and pillaged and‐‐

11:36.154 --> 11:38.365
You know, let's just,
let's just be honest.

11:43.954 --> 11:47.040
<i>The Caribbean food
didn't happen organically</i>

11:47.040 --> 11:49.334
<i>and it didn't happen comfortably.</i>

11:50.043 --> 11:53.338
<i>It was hundreds of thousands of people</i>

11:53.839 --> 11:57.885
<i>stacked on top of each other
in like a sardine can.</i>

12:00.637 --> 12:02.598
S <i>o you've got like, things like salt cod,</i>

12:02.598 --> 12:04.808
<i>but then like hoisin</i>

12:04.808 --> 12:07.936
and soy sauce is like‐‐
‐ Very... very like‐‐ Super Asia.

12:07.936 --> 12:12.983
But also readily available
and highly used in the Caribbean.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.280
<i>When I came here,
I wanted to make a dish</i>

12:18.280 --> 12:21.658
representative of
Saint Vincent and Antigua.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.744
The ducana dish.

12:24.286 --> 12:27.122
I wanted to keep it
as traditional as I could

12:27.122 --> 12:29.124
<i>and serve it with salted cod.</i>

12:29.625 --> 12:33.712
<i>Ducana is a pudding made
from sweet potato, coconut milk,</i>

12:33.712 --> 12:35.672
<i>sometimes spices, sometimes not,</i>

12:35.672 --> 12:36.715
<i>wrapped in banana leaf.</i>

12:37.257 --> 12:38.759
This is the fancy restaurant move.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.973
<i>This is a riff on
what I would do at Barbados</i>

12:44.973 --> 12:48.936
and what would be served
here in Australia.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.773
The food is a integrated fused food.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.901
‐ It's like sweet, salty, crunchy.

12:55.901 --> 12:56.860
Mm.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.362
‐ It's so good.

12:58.362 --> 12:59.363
Mm.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.533
<i>This is like a world
without borders, right?</i>

13:02.533 --> 13:03.700
<i>You could do it through food.</i>

13:03.700 --> 13:06.870
Like, we gotta try to work
towards the future together

13:06.870 --> 13:09.873
rather than individually apart.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.672
‐ So that's where I think future food is,
is when

13:17.631 --> 13:21.552
you let people who are open to change
and open to deliciousness

13:21.552 --> 13:23.095
and open to cultures

13:23.887 --> 13:25.180
mix and match.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.101
<i>But, here's the guarantee,
there's not enough land</i>

13:29.101 --> 13:31.645
<i>to continue to produce food.</i>

13:33.480 --> 13:35.148
<i>To me, that's what's gonna change.</i>

13:35.148 --> 13:37.401
<i>It's gonna be how we grow things.</i>

13:42.447 --> 13:44.324
<i>Vertical faming will have to work.</i>

13:44.700 --> 13:45.784
<i>Here's the idea.</i>

13:45.784 --> 13:48.078
I can have vegetables grown locally

13:48.537 --> 13:53.500
and I don't need to use
a lot of land, water or sunlight.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.296
-<i>And I can grow it like 12
- X faster,
it's like, that's awesome.</i>

13:58.797 --> 14:03.051
‐ Field agriculture is the most widespread
and destructive human practice

14:03.051 --> 14:05.012
on the planet, right?

14:05.012 --> 14:07.181
We go out into a field and we till it up.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.141
We go to a forest and we cut it down.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.475
Like, that's agriculture.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.643
Ninety nine percent of the water

14:11.643 --> 14:13.729
that you put on a crop
in the field is transpired.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.230
It just evaporates in the atmosphere.

14:15.606 --> 14:18.233
<i>And in our farm we're able
to capture all of that water,</i>

14:18.233 --> 14:20.569
<i>condense it and recirculate it
back into the solutions.</i>

14:25.866 --> 14:28.285
This is vertical grow.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.749
Wow.
Yeah.

14:35.334 --> 14:36.418
And it's more efficient

14:36.418 --> 14:39.796
to have it vertical than like this way?

14:39.796 --> 14:41.048
Yeah.
Instead of stacks?

14:41.048 --> 14:41.882
Yeah, when you go up

14:41.882 --> 14:43.425
you just have
a lot more room to work with.

14:43.842 --> 14:47.763
Um, we can change the temperature,
humidity, nutrients that go to each line.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.182
And each line has its own nutrient recipe.

14:50.182 --> 14:53.310
They're in here around ten days
from start to finish.

14:53.936 --> 14:54.728
Yeah.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.855
Every time I'm in a room like this

14:56.855 --> 14:59.149
I keep on thinking about all the marijuana
that I could be growing.

15:00.609 --> 15:03.320
But seriously, you should grow both.

15:04.363 --> 15:05.364
They're both vegetables.

15:05.364 --> 15:06.823
Let's see what they have to say.
They're both plants.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.037
It's good lettuce.

15:12.663 --> 15:13.789
There's a big difference

15:13.789 --> 15:15.249
than what you'd go buy

15:15.249 --> 15:17.751
in a grocery store
where something has to be on the truck

15:17.751 --> 15:21.255
and is designed not for flavor
but it's designed for the truck.

15:21.255 --> 15:25.259
<i>And the skin is like tough enough
so that it can get to a grocery store.</i>

15:25.259 --> 15:27.010
This is our seeding area.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.721
And we do all of our cultivars here.

15:33.225 --> 15:36.979
Those little fingers on the robots
are gonna pick up the seedlings

15:36.979 --> 15:39.022
and they'll put them
in the tower on both sides.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.441
They can do about 200 plants per minute.

15:42.276 --> 15:43.610
Pretty cool.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.282
It's‐it's fascinating.

15:48.740 --> 15:49.449
Yeah, we really try

15:49.449 --> 15:50.617
to think outside the box

15:50.617 --> 15:52.411
<i>and be as efficient as we can.</i>

15:52.411 --> 15:55.247
<i>It's how you get ahead.
You gotta be as innovative as possible.</i>

15:58.792 --> 16:00.127
<i>We've been playing God with food</i>

16:00.127 --> 16:01.295
<i>for a while now.</i>

16:01.753 --> 16:03.839
<i>Almost everything we eat today</i>

16:03.839 --> 16:07.009
<i>at some point was engineered</i>

16:07.009 --> 16:10.387
<i>to either grow more heartily
during droughts</i>

16:10.387 --> 16:12.973
<i>or to be plumper.</i>

16:12.973 --> 16:14.850
<i>Everything we eat today</i>

16:15.392 --> 16:18.187
doesn't look anything like its origin
many, many years ago.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.314
<i>I have tasted a lot of things</i>

16:20.314 --> 16:23.192
<i>that weren't even close
to the original seed</i>

16:23.192 --> 16:26.361
<i>but the earlier versions
weren't as delicious as they are today.</i>

16:27.112 --> 16:29.823
<i>We have to, like, reframe the conversation</i>

16:29.823 --> 16:30.866
<i>and the problem here, right?</i>

16:30.866 --> 16:32.701
<i>It's not like we're making a choice</i>

16:32.701 --> 16:35.120
between fields and vertical farming.
‐ That's right.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.955
We're running out of land.

16:38.624 --> 16:41.460
<i>Not all farming is bad</i>

16:41.460 --> 16:44.880
<i>but I do think it's important
that it's done in the right way.</i>

16:45.756 --> 16:50.344
<i>And it's probably some kind of blend
of AI and humans working together</i>

16:50.344 --> 16:52.971
because clearly automation
is gonna be something

16:52.971 --> 16:54.598
we have to deal with more and more.

17:02.940 --> 17:06.443
<i>I have no idea how automation
is going to actually happen.</i>

17:07.736 --> 17:12.157
And this is where it gets in this
moral paradox or conundrum in my mind

17:12.157 --> 17:14.701
where, okay, I would like the human touch,

17:14.701 --> 17:16.620
I would like to employ humans,

17:16.620 --> 17:19.540
<i>but it doesn't seem we'll be
able to find an equitable way</i>

17:19.540 --> 17:22.709
<i>for human labor to pick
all these grapes, these artichokes.</i>

17:22.709 --> 17:26.004
<i>So the question I think
that people have to ask ultimately</i>

17:26.004 --> 17:28.173
<i>for automation in farming</i>

17:28.173 --> 17:31.927
is if you're pro reduction
of human suffering.

17:32.386 --> 17:33.846
<i>At least we should be asking the question,</i>

17:33.846 --> 17:36.098
<i>how do you lower suffering?</i>

17:41.311 --> 17:42.771
<i>This Monarch tractor</i>

17:42.771 --> 17:46.316
<i>is an all‐electric, driver optional
smart tractor.</i>

17:47.609 --> 17:48.944
<i>Us being driver optional,</i>

17:48.944 --> 17:51.655
even though we have
a steering wheel and pedals,

17:51.655 --> 17:54.992
once the driver trains it,
we can repeat all the operations.

17:54.992 --> 17:57.327
That helps the farmers save money

17:57.327 --> 18:00.539
<i>and it also increases the safety
of the farmworkers.</i>

18:03.000 --> 18:05.002
<i>We have camera around the tractor,</i>

18:05.002 --> 18:08.172
<i>we have sensors
that pick up important information.</i>

18:08.172 --> 18:10.174
<i>We can give you a digital story.</i>

18:10.174 --> 18:11.884
We could do a highlight reel for you.

18:12.593 --> 18:16.346
So while you're eating something
you could see a 15‐second clip

18:16.346 --> 18:18.348
of exactly how that food was grown.

18:23.562 --> 18:24.438
<i>Worst‐case scenarios</i>

18:24.438 --> 18:25.898
<i>like there's no more humans‐‐</i>

18:25.898 --> 18:27.316
<i>It's already happening.</i>

18:27.316 --> 18:28.817
<i>I have, like, Alexa.</i>

18:28.817 --> 18:31.028
It tells me like,
hey, you're probably out of this.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.529
You should restock on this.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.449
That's weird and scary,

18:35.449 --> 18:37.117
but it's also like incredibly helpful.

18:38.327 --> 18:41.872
<i>And I think the future of supermarket
will probably be online.</i>

18:42.539 --> 18:43.498
<i>Virtual.</i>

18:44.041 --> 18:46.752
<i>Where you can see everything
without having to go into the supermarket.</i>

18:46.752 --> 18:49.630
<i>Your age has already been
pre‐verified through your profile.</i>

18:49.630 --> 18:51.256
<i>So no need to wait for an ID check.</i>

18:51.256 --> 18:53.800
<i>Just place the item in your cart
whenever you're ready.</i>

18:53.800 --> 18:55.177
‐ It's gonna be something like that.

18:55.177 --> 18:58.722
And it's all gonna be shared information.

18:58.722 --> 19:01.099
I'll be honest,
I think that's gonna be awesome.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.560
Scary, but, like, in terms of privacy

19:03.560 --> 19:04.770
I don't give a fuck.

19:04.770 --> 19:05.896
Take my shit.

19:06.772 --> 19:08.148
What are you gonna do with it?

19:08.148 --> 19:11.318
♪ dramatic music plays ♪

19:15.989 --> 19:19.451
<i>We are in Elysium. We're in food future.</i>

19:19.451 --> 19:21.453
‐ The future looks like an airport.

19:22.204 --> 19:25.290
Basically, utopia is gonna have a Cinnabon

19:25.916 --> 19:27.709
and an Auntie Anne's Pretzel.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.253
‐ That's what‐‐ Yes.
That's your utopia, your‐‐

19:29.253 --> 19:30.796
‐ That's where we're at.
We're‐we're at a mall.

19:30.796 --> 19:35.509
Everything is standardized and you have,
you know, good to mediocre food.

19:35.509 --> 19:36.927
Because of automation.

19:36.927 --> 19:39.054
‐ Do you think
automation makes food better?

19:39.596 --> 19:43.058
‐ I think automation
is gonna make food more consistent.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.686
It's going to be less peaks and valleys.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.187
More of a consistent plateau.

19:47.479 --> 19:50.232
‐ Yeah. It's almost like
for us all to survive

19:50.232 --> 19:52.651
and for these art forms to survive,

19:53.443 --> 19:55.362
is that we have to concede greatness?

19:55.362 --> 19:58.365
Like we have to give up on being great,
give up on eight, nines and tens

19:58.365 --> 20:01.159
so that another generation
gets to be sevens?

20:01.159 --> 20:03.120
Like, that might be
the future we're facing.

20:03.787 --> 20:08.458
‐ I think for food to be
more consistent and more accessible

20:08.458 --> 20:13.172
and less, um, less negative aspects,

20:13.172 --> 20:14.631
it'll be less delicious.

20:14.631 --> 20:18.927
Less delicious
for more people to have access to it.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.263
I think it's a good trade‐off.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.309
<i>Let's look at some facts about 2050.</i>

20:25.726 --> 20:27.936
<i>The population will be around ten billion.</i>

20:27.936 --> 20:30.522
<i>And it's gonna be really hot
and really crowded.</i>

20:30.522 --> 20:32.149
<i>Like the subway but everywhere.</i>

20:32.858 --> 20:36.069
<i>The average human needs over
2,000 calories a day to survive.</i>

20:36.069 --> 20:38.155
<i>The question is
where does that food come from?</i>

20:38.697 --> 20:40.574
<i>Commodities humans take from granted today</i>

20:40.574 --> 20:43.785
<i>like chicken, beef,
or Jack in the Box Tiny Tacos</i>

20:43.785 --> 20:45.704
<i>require tons of land and water.</i>

20:46.496 --> 20:48.665
<i>At a certain point around 2050,</i>

20:48.665 --> 20:50.334
<i>the amount of protein needed by mankind</i>

20:50.334 --> 20:52.669
<i>is going to exceed the total amount
you're able to produce.</i>

20:53.337 --> 20:55.380
<i>It's an event being called
the protein bottleneck.</i>

20:56.048 --> 20:57.257
<i>And everyone's invited.</i>

20:59.051 --> 21:00.260
<i>The source of food</i>

21:00.260 --> 21:01.803
<i>and the bottleneck of food</i>

21:01.803 --> 21:04.640
is probably what you should be
thinking about before restaurants

21:04.640 --> 21:06.975
because what's the point
of having a steakhouse

21:06.975 --> 21:08.644
if you can't get the steak?

21:10.604 --> 21:12.314
<i>Growing a cow to eat it</i>

21:12.314 --> 21:15.442
is about the most inefficient way
you can possibly imagine

21:15.442 --> 21:17.819
to make food.

21:17.819 --> 21:20.197
You know, that's gone, right?

21:21.240 --> 21:25.160
<i>That authentic experience
of eating real meat in 100 years</i>

21:25.160 --> 21:27.704
<i>is a privilege
only for the very, very wealthy.</i>

21:28.163 --> 21:30.207
Or the very, very, very, very poor.

21:32.543 --> 21:35.546
‐ Soylent Green is people!

21:35.963 --> 21:38.340
‐ <i>Soylent Green</i> is a dystopia,
I mean, that's‐‐ You know‐‐

21:38.757 --> 21:39.842
Uh‐‐

21:39.842 --> 21:42.970
‐ My wife said I can't talk about ca‐‐
cannibalism, but‐‐

21:43.554 --> 21:44.555
‐ You went there.

21:45.222 --> 21:47.015
‐ Well, how do you not?
It's the elephant in the room.

21:47.599 --> 21:51.311
‐ I mean, is cannibalism part
of our dystopian future, I don't know.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.688
‐ It's part of our dystopian past.

21:52.688 --> 21:53.689
It's part of our dystopian past.

21:53.689 --> 21:56.191
‐ We've spent a hell of a lot more time
eating people than not eating people,

21:56.191 --> 21:57.359
I will put that out there.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.777
Oh, no, this is what you were afraid of.

21:59.278 --> 22:00.237
And I promise we'll talk about

22:00.237 --> 22:01.113
these cricket things in a minute.

22:01.113 --> 22:02.155
I was just gonna say, is no one gonna

22:02.155 --> 22:04.283
comment on the fact
that we got a table full of bugs?

22:04.283 --> 22:06.410
‐ By the way, on the drive over here,

22:06.410 --> 22:07.828
I'm like, "We're gonna eat bugs
at this meal."

22:07.828 --> 22:08.829
‐ We were laughing about bug‐‐
bug bits.

22:08.829 --> 22:09.997
Don't eat the silica packets.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.248
‐ I'd rather eat the silica packets.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.376
‐ Which‐which flavor did you get?

22:14.376 --> 22:15.586
I got cheesy ranch.

22:15.586 --> 22:16.753
That just doesn't feel like

22:16.753 --> 22:17.921
it would go well with the cricket.

22:18.547 --> 22:19.715
Well, I'm not eating that.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.467
This is dystopian to me.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.678
If I'm stuck and this is the only protein,

22:24.678 --> 22:26.054
I'm gonna be like,
"Damn, I'm gonna make you

22:26.054 --> 22:28.223
the best cricket dish of all time."

22:28.891 --> 22:31.393
But right now I'm not gonna be like yes!
‐ Yeah.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.189
<i>There are certain cultures that insects</i>

22:35.189 --> 22:37.524
<i>are already integrated in how they eat.</i>

22:38.567 --> 22:41.695
<i>But what's delicious to one culture
won't be delicious to another.</i>

22:42.362 --> 22:44.781
I'm gonna try my best to appreciate it,

22:44.781 --> 22:46.909
but it's not something
I personally find delicious.

22:47.618 --> 22:51.121
But in the future
if I don't have a juicy rib eye

22:51.121 --> 22:54.082
and I have bugs and I'm hungry,
guess what I'm eating.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.459
I'm eating bugs.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.340
‐ Hi, I'm Chris.
‐ Hi, Chris.

23:01.340 --> 23:02.883
I'm Monica.
‐ Nice to meet you.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.970
‐ So this is an urban farm

23:06.970 --> 23:09.932
an urban, um, I guess,
edible insect farm.

23:10.349 --> 23:12.809
So what we're farming here
is, uh, mealworms.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.770
♪ vocalizing ♪

23:14.770 --> 23:17.022
So these guys are mealworms.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.649
Uh‐huh. They definitely are.

23:19.483 --> 23:20.526
‐ They like heat.

23:20.526 --> 23:22.194
That's why one of the reasons
why they say, like.

23:22.194 --> 23:25.113
insects are gonna be
the food of the future

23:25.113 --> 23:26.865
because the climate change, right?

23:26.865 --> 23:29.117
<i>The warmer the planet gets,
the more insects.</i>

23:29.117 --> 23:30.244
<i>The more insects there will be.</i>

23:30.744 --> 23:31.995
Let me get in here and feel this a little.

23:31.995 --> 23:33.497
Ooh, it does feel nice.

23:33.497 --> 23:35.249
Very calming.

23:35.249 --> 23:36.708
Oh, it's not that calming.

23:38.877 --> 23:39.878
<i>It's a cultural thing.</i>

23:39.878 --> 23:42.089
<i>'Cause some cultures, you know,</i>

23:42.089 --> 23:43.257
<i>they don't even think about it.</i>

23:43.257 --> 23:44.466
<i>It's just a type of food.</i>

23:45.217 --> 23:47.719
I was exposed to insects
when I was like seven, eight years old,

23:47.719 --> 23:49.471
which was really hard
for me to like‐‐ Ugh!

23:49.471 --> 23:52.015
I was very squeamish
about insects in general.

23:52.641 --> 23:55.519
<i>I'm just trying to revive this culture,</i>

23:55.519 --> 23:58.564
<i>adding diversity into our diet.</i>

23:58.564 --> 24:02.109
<i>And insects are such an amazing
protein type of food</i>

24:02.109 --> 24:03.277
<i>that we need to be tapping in.</i>

24:04.152 --> 24:05.445
Really? You're gonna eat it?

24:05.445 --> 24:06.947
‐ I mean, well, I'm here.
What am I gonna do?

24:06.947 --> 24:08.282
Not eat one of these now?

24:11.034 --> 24:11.952
They're very fatty.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.787
They have like a good fat.

24:13.787 --> 24:14.955
Like‐‐

24:14.955 --> 24:16.748
‐ That's actually very good,
I'm not gonna lie.

24:16.748 --> 24:17.958
It is very nutty but it's like‐‐

24:19.626 --> 24:20.669
It burst a little bit.

24:20.669 --> 24:22.588
But it's like, it's actually very‐‐ Hmm.

24:22.588 --> 24:24.798
Oh, my God.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.216
‐ Actually it was like very delicious.

24:26.216 --> 24:27.718
The skeleton is like a‐‐ I‐‐ It's‐‐

24:27.718 --> 24:29.094
I bet it's much better toasted.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.971
Like crunchier and like that.
‐ Yeah.

24:30.971 --> 24:32.222
‐ But actually the flavor, you're right.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.849
It's nutty and it's very‐‐
‐ It's nutty, like‐‐ Yeah.

24:33.849 --> 24:36.101
My daughter eats them toasted.

24:36.101 --> 24:39.313
With spoon. Like literally,
it's a bowl with toasted mealworms.

24:39.313 --> 24:40.397
They're like crunchy

24:40.397 --> 24:41.982
and she just goes for it.
‐ Yeah.

24:42.733 --> 24:46.904
So these guys
are toasted chili lime crickets.

24:47.446 --> 24:50.616
<i>To me, like, knowing
where my food comes from,</i>

24:50.616 --> 24:53.493
<i>and how much, you know, they put back
or they take from the planet</i>

24:53.493 --> 24:54.828
<i>is very important.</i>

24:54.828 --> 24:56.580
<i>The more that we educate about people,</i>

24:56.580 --> 25:00.709
<i>our decisions, our choices on food
can help in the future.</i>

25:00.709 --> 25:02.127
<i>That's amazing.</i>

25:09.301 --> 25:12.137
If you were to make a movie set in 2050,

25:12.137 --> 25:13.138
what would it be?

25:13.722 --> 25:15.182
‐ It's <i>Demolition Man.</i>

25:17.559 --> 25:20.437
‐ Who wants to take me to dinner
at Taco Bell?

25:20.437 --> 25:21.730
And Lord knows I wouldn't mind a burrito.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.399
<i>I'd make a frame by frame recreation</i>

25:24.399 --> 25:26.777
of <i>Demolition Man.</i>

25:26.777 --> 25:27.945
The restaurant.

25:27.945 --> 25:29.696
‐ Now all restaurants are Taco Bell.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.281
‐ Exactamundo.

25:35.077 --> 25:37.120
‐ This is like a ground beef taco,

25:37.120 --> 25:40.290
but in the future maybe it's ground beef,
maybe it's lab‐grown.

25:40.290 --> 25:42.334
<i>Maybe it's gonna be meat alternative.</i>

25:42.918 --> 25:45.838
‐ Oh, hell, yeah. Taco Bell will win
the franchise wars for sure.

25:46.255 --> 25:47.548
‐ You think?
‐ Oh, yeah.

25:48.382 --> 25:49.716
<i>It's a lot more probable</i>

25:49.716 --> 25:52.261
<i>than say like a bottle of Soylent Green.</i>

25:52.678 --> 25:55.889
‐ It tastes like a white guy
who made Mexican food, which I love.

25:56.557 --> 25:57.641
You know.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.310
You're also being pragmatic.

26:00.310 --> 26:02.187
I think if you asked anyone 20 years ago,

26:02.187 --> 26:04.147
which grocery store will win,

26:04.147 --> 26:06.733
I don't think many people
would have said Amazon, right?

26:06.733 --> 26:09.611
Your thinking is‐is very macroeconomic

26:09.611 --> 26:11.947
and‐and I think will become true.

26:11.947 --> 26:13.073
‐ It's like

26:13.949 --> 26:15.450
mass appeal Mexican food.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.287
A lot of umami, texture‐‐

26:18.287 --> 26:19.580
‐ And it appeals to everybody.

26:19.580 --> 26:22.207
These flavors,
it's very easy to understand.

26:22.207 --> 26:23.041
‐ Absolutely.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.752
You know,
people are gonna still eat pizza.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.296
It may have different toppings.

26:27.296 --> 26:29.423
People are still gonna eat hamburgers

26:29.423 --> 26:31.133
but it may be filled with something else.

26:31.133 --> 26:32.676
‐ What?
‐ Not regular beef.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.219
They're still gonna eat
chicken sandwiches.

26:34.219 --> 26:35.804
They're still gonna eat Caesar salads.

26:35.804 --> 26:38.140
They're still gonna eat
chicken wings and chicken nuggets.

26:38.473 --> 26:41.810
<i>You think the world will stop eating
chicken tenders in 100 years?</i>

26:41.810 --> 26:42.728
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

26:45.981 --> 26:48.400
<i>Is the fried chicken finger future</i>

26:48.400 --> 26:50.235
<i>an optimistic
or pessimistic view, though?</i>

26:50.235 --> 26:51.904
‐ I think it's real.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.408
<i>I think most people will be eating</i>

26:56.408 --> 26:57.993
<i>some kinda mock chicken meat.</i>

26:57.993 --> 27:01.955
<i>Probably made out of mushrooms
or something lab‐grown.</i>

27:02.873 --> 27:05.417
You know what the food of the future is?
Look at fast food around the world.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.213
<i>What does McDonald's in India...?
Which is great.</i>

27:09.213 --> 27:11.465
‐ McAloo Tikki burgers.
And they're fantastic.

27:11.465 --> 27:12.424
‐ It's still a burger though.

27:13.008 --> 27:15.552
<i>You're seeing the future of food happen.</i>

27:15.552 --> 27:18.639
<i>When you look at a fast food
hamburger commercial, they're like...</i>

27:19.473 --> 27:23.810
check it out,
the new griddled sriracha hamburger

27:23.810 --> 27:26.647
or the spicy gochujang
fried chicken sandwich.

27:26.647 --> 27:30.984
McDonald's will have
the ghost pepper Szechuan spice McChicken.

27:31.735 --> 27:32.903
That's the future.

27:33.362 --> 27:35.239
<i>The future is basically
what we're eating right now.</i>

27:37.574 --> 27:39.076
<i>So if you're making chicken fingers,</i>

27:39.076 --> 27:42.746
is algae still the most
dystopian vision of the future?

27:42.746 --> 27:45.165
‐ I think that makes <i>you</i>
the most dystopian vision.

27:45.165 --> 27:47.376
‐ Well, mine's just called
the most pragmatic.

27:47.376 --> 27:49.503
<i>People aren't gonna
all of a sudden be like,</i>

27:49.503 --> 27:51.463
<i>"Ugh, chicken fingers,
fuckin' disgusting."</i>

27:52.589 --> 27:54.007
<i>I have my dredged powder.</i>

27:54.007 --> 27:56.176
The futuristic dredged powder
that can be anything.

27:56.176 --> 27:58.220
But I'm adding blue‐green algae.

27:59.012 --> 28:02.516
All of a sudden my dish
is way more futuristic.

28:06.603 --> 28:07.729
<i>And you know what the future will have?</i>

28:07.729 --> 28:09.565
People that double dip. Always.

28:10.315 --> 28:11.441
<i>Chicken fingers will not go away</i>

28:11.441 --> 28:13.569
<i>because they'll turn bugs
into chicken fingers.</i>

28:13.569 --> 28:14.987
<i>And now I can eat that.</i>

28:15.571 --> 28:17.364
As long as it tastes like
a chicken finger.

28:17.948 --> 28:18.949
I'll be okay.

28:19.408 --> 28:20.617
Dipped in ranch dressing.

28:23.287 --> 28:24.872
See, I was picturing utopia as like,

28:24.872 --> 28:28.125
all right, as humans,
we have once again conquered the challenge

28:28.125 --> 28:29.543
and answered the bell

28:29.543 --> 28:32.421
and figured out how to
like maintain our life and continue.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.592
<i>But there has to be
like an apocalyptic situation</i>

28:36.592 --> 28:37.801
<i>for people to be like, "Wait."</i>

28:38.427 --> 28:39.928
‐ That's coming with the environment.

28:39.928 --> 28:41.763
‐ Yeah. It is. It's here.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.223
We're in some hardship.

28:44.349 --> 28:46.018
<i>In order for your utopia,</i>

28:46.018 --> 28:48.270
<i>there has to be immense suffering.</i>

28:48.270 --> 28:49.188
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:49.188 --> 28:51.190
<i>I'm like our parents.
Right.</i>

28:51.190 --> 28:52.566
<i>"Without pain and struggle</i>

28:52.566 --> 28:54.860
you're not David Chang,"
would be their answer.

28:54.860 --> 28:57.321
And that's not me wishing pain on anyone.

28:57.321 --> 28:58.947
‐ This is some real Asian shit.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.326
‐ I really do think pain is a teacher.

29:03.577 --> 29:05.078
<i>You know, I'm an alarmist,</i>

29:05.078 --> 29:07.080
I do think things
are gonna get really bad,

29:07.080 --> 29:09.124
but I think we're making
much more progress

29:09.124 --> 29:10.751
than I thought was possible
a few years ago,

29:10.751 --> 29:13.879
and that means
that the likely future that we're facing,

29:14.546 --> 29:16.924
at least allows for the possibility

29:16.924 --> 29:20.761
of some amount of prosperity
and flourishing and justice in the world.

29:21.887 --> 29:23.180
‐ Do you wanna know the future?

29:23.764 --> 29:25.474
‐ What about the past?
‐ Hey.

29:25.474 --> 29:27.434
<i>Is it like you can only look to the future</i>

29:27.434 --> 29:29.728
if you kind of remember the past?

29:29.728 --> 29:33.065
‐ Yeah, and future really doesn't exist.

29:34.149 --> 29:35.734
'Cause you just don't truly know.

29:37.236 --> 29:38.779
<i>My personal opinion is,</i>

29:39.196 --> 29:41.031
you know, food is a meme

29:41.031 --> 29:43.825
that tasty things wanna survive.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.244
I hope so.
Mm‐hmm.

29:45.244 --> 29:47.704
‐ They're going to find a way to merge

29:47.704 --> 29:49.915
<i>with culture in different ways.</i>

29:49.915 --> 29:51.083
<i>You know, I hope you're right.</i>

29:51.083 --> 29:52.668
<i>That flavor finds a way.</i>

29:53.210 --> 29:56.004
<i>But if you have a culture in which
you're only fed your favorite dish</i>

29:56.004 --> 29:58.298
<i>from, you know, you like chicken nuggets
when you're three years old,</i>

29:58.757 --> 30:01.134
the algorithm's gonna give you
chicken nuggets till you're dead.

30:01.134 --> 30:02.970
Right? At some point in there

30:02.970 --> 30:06.139
it will be nice to accidentally
try something new,

30:07.266 --> 30:11.645
<i>that I remain hopelessly
ever so slightly techno‐optimistic.</i>

30:12.646 --> 30:16.984
‐ There is some
unbelievable ingenuity in food,

30:16.984 --> 30:19.236
in food science, in food production

30:19.236 --> 30:20.529
that is around the corner.

30:20.529 --> 30:21.905
<i>You're gonna have vertical farming</i>

30:21.905 --> 30:23.365
<i>which loses a lot of money right now,</i>

30:23.365 --> 30:24.575
<i>but it has to work.</i>

30:25.200 --> 30:26.660
<i>Cultivated meats is very expensive.</i>

30:26.660 --> 30:28.912
<i>I think people will reject it at first</i>

30:28.912 --> 30:29.955
<i>and then they will accept it</i>

30:29.955 --> 30:31.540
<i>because they have no choice.</i>

30:31.540 --> 30:34.209
‐ And I think maybe
we can rise out of this hardship

30:34.209 --> 30:36.003
with some more communal thoughts.

30:37.671 --> 30:38.797
<i>I'm concerned
that people are gonna be like,</i>

30:38.797 --> 30:39.673
<i>"Oh, that can't happen.</i>

30:39.673 --> 30:41.675
<i>You can't do this. That's not right."</i>

30:42.342 --> 30:43.886
<i>We don't have the fucking answers.</i>

30:43.886 --> 30:46.346
<i>But the wrong thing we can do is nothing.</i>

30:48.807 --> 30:51.226
The only thing I hope for the future

30:51.852 --> 30:54.646
is that everything's on the fucking table.
