00:27.913 --> 00:29.512
So, you know how
girls aren't supposed

00:29.513 --> 00:31.611
to eat on the first date?
Well, just a heads-up...

00:31.612 --> 00:33.792
I'm starving,
and I'm not going to hold back.

00:33.793 --> 00:36.240
Well, I don't mind breaking a
rule or two, like how the guy's

00:36.241 --> 00:38.421
supposed to pick up the check
on a first date.

00:38.422 --> 00:40.878
Ryan, can we dialogue?
I talk, you listen. Go.

00:40.879 --> 00:42.233
I need you to...

00:42.234 --> 00:44.327
Am I interrupting
something here?

00:44.328 --> 00:46.481
We were just on our way out.
Well, it'll just take a second.

00:46.482 --> 00:49.246
The CNVN311 patent.

00:49.247 --> 00:52.514
I need you to review and
summarize by Friday. Possible?

00:52.515 --> 00:54.881
This Friday? Sure.

00:54.882 --> 00:57.283
Ooh, you sound confident.

00:57.284 --> 00:58.545
Thursday.

00:58.546 --> 01:01.070
Possible?

01:01.071 --> 01:03.164
Sure. Thursday.
Whatever you need.

01:03.165 --> 01:04.863
I like your attitude.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.431
Let's make it Wednesday.

01:07.799 --> 01:09.899
Wow.

01:09.900 --> 01:13.166
We have eyeless test bunnies
in the lab

01:13.167 --> 01:14.370
who have it easier than you.

01:14.371 --> 01:17.172
I'm gonna have to start this
tonight. Rain check?

01:17.173 --> 01:20.241
Sure.

01:20.242 --> 01:22.042
I'll just pretend all this
waiting and rescheduling

01:22.043 --> 01:23.810
is some sort of
elaborate foreplay.

01:27.146 --> 01:28.479
What do you want?

01:28.480 --> 01:31.081
I just want to talk.

01:31.082 --> 01:34.046
Staying home alone is boring.

01:34.047 --> 01:36.045
I'm sorry, but I'm working.
Jenna and Drew will be back

01:36.046 --> 01:37.479
in a couple of weeks.
I'm hanging up now.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.081
Wait, wait, real quick.

01:39.082 --> 01:41.449
Did you have anything
interesting for lunch?

01:41.450 --> 01:44.651
Any spicy sausage?

01:44.652 --> 01:48.214
Did you fart?
What did it smell like?

01:48.215 --> 01:50.713
My boss just threw another
huge assignment in my lap.

01:50.714 --> 01:53.061
I don't have time for this.
I even had to cancel a date.

01:53.062 --> 01:55.464
Well, that's 'cause you let
your boss walk all over you.

01:55.465 --> 01:57.332
You can't let him keep chipping
away

01:57.333 --> 02:01.102
at your dignity like a cheap
coat of artic glow semigloss.

02:01.103 --> 02:02.337
Garbage time!

02:02.338 --> 02:04.406
What choice do I have?

02:04.407 --> 02:06.341
I'm lucky to even have this job.

02:06.342 --> 02:08.477
You keep thinking like that,

02:08.478 --> 02:10.112
you'll be cleaning up
other people's shit

02:10.113 --> 02:11.646
for the rest of your life.

02:11.647 --> 02:12.814
You need to stand up
for yourself, mate.

02:12.815 --> 02:14.483
What I need is for my boss

02:14.484 --> 02:16.818
to ease up and you to let me
get some work done.

02:16.819 --> 02:18.386
Don't wait up.

02:20.722 --> 02:22.756
- Oh, this is bullshit!
- In.

02:22.757 --> 02:25.292
- But I'm innocent.
- So you didn't trash my living room?

02:25.293 --> 02:27.060
One man's trash is
another man's feng shui.

02:27.061 --> 02:28.828
That's why I left that
pool of yellow water

02:28.829 --> 02:30.330
by the southeast door.

02:30.331 --> 02:32.632
I'm going to be late. Get in.

02:32.633 --> 02:35.201
Why can't I go with you?
I can't take a dog to the office.

02:35.202 --> 02:37.337
So you're just going to
leave me in that thing,

02:37.338 --> 02:39.439
like some guy caged up
like some animal?

02:39.440 --> 02:42.442
Ryan, I'm
a social butterfly.

02:42.443 --> 02:45.679
I need to be where the
people dance. Please?

02:45.680 --> 02:48.349
All right, but this
is a one time thing.

02:48.350 --> 02:51.385
- Understand?
- Yeah!

02:54.022 --> 02:57.057
Wait till I distract Stacey,
go straight to my office,

02:57.058 --> 02:59.192
third door on the right,
and stay there.

03:07.235 --> 03:09.336
Hey, Stacey.
Hey, Ryan.

03:09.337 --> 03:11.738
How's the, uh, coffee?

03:11.739 --> 03:14.474
Oh, um, actually,
it's not that great.

03:14.475 --> 03:16.209
- Oh.
- Yeah.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.178
Ah, shit!

03:18.179 --> 03:20.179
There's a guy over there!
There's a guy over here!

03:20.180 --> 03:21.748
There's a lady here!

03:21.749 --> 03:23.516
Ryan, look, look!

03:23.517 --> 03:25.685
- There's people everywhere!
- Oh, my God.

03:25.686 --> 03:27.220
He is so cute.

03:27.221 --> 03:29.589
And you, darling,
are a 9.5 out of 20.

03:29.590 --> 03:31.191
Oh!

03:31.192 --> 03:33.359
- Oh, come here, buddy.
- All right.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.962
Ooh, he's so soft.

03:35.963 --> 03:38.331
Sounds like somebody
wants to see my balls.

03:38.332 --> 03:40.667
Aw, he wants a tummy rub.

03:40.668 --> 03:42.368
I'll do it.

03:42.369 --> 03:44.203
Is he with you?

03:44.204 --> 03:45.638
Uh, he's my neighbor's dog.

03:45.639 --> 03:46.939
I'm watching him for the week.

03:46.940 --> 03:49.141
- Oh.
- You okay?

03:49.142 --> 03:50.709
Yeah, I just need
a cup of coffee.

03:50.710 --> 03:53.012
Traffic is out of control!

03:53.013 --> 03:56.148
Instead of a high-occupancy
Lane, okay, they should have

03:56.149 --> 03:57.816
a high-productivity Lane,
and that way, the people

03:57.817 --> 03:59.251
who contribute the
most to society

03:59.252 --> 04:02.121
can get to where they
need to go faster!

04:02.122 --> 04:04.223
Stacey, get the guy who's in
charge of that on my phone!

04:04.224 --> 04:06.191
Is anyone else concerned
that there's a stale,

04:06.192 --> 04:09.124
half-eaten wheat thin
under this desk?

04:10.597 --> 04:13.065
Is that a dog in my office?

04:13.066 --> 04:14.667
Huh?

04:14.668 --> 04:16.767
Tell me...

04:16.769 --> 04:18.303
That is not

04:18.305 --> 04:21.245
a doggy in my office!

04:21.247 --> 04:22.752
Whoo!

04:22.753 --> 04:24.189
Hi-ya, doggy!

04:24.190 --> 04:27.661
Hi, doggy! Whoa...

04:27.662 --> 04:29.830
Who's a cuddly puppy? You are?
Yes, you are.

04:29.831 --> 04:32.902
Grinding me, on the floor,
spooning me from behind.

04:32.903 --> 04:35.075
This is happening.
This is actually happening.

04:35.076 --> 04:37.047
Ooh, whose baby are you?
Huh?

04:37.048 --> 04:39.825
He's... my baby, sir.

04:39.826 --> 04:43.534
He is? Is Ryan
your big daddy?

04:43.535 --> 04:46.107
Jeremy, I have the state highway
commissioner on line one.

04:46.108 --> 04:48.378
Well, I've got a
belly rub on line two.

04:48.379 --> 04:50.480
Yes, I do! Yes, I do!

04:50.481 --> 04:54.900
Hey, Ryan.
How's that patent report going?

04:54.901 --> 04:57.003
I may have to work all night,

04:57.004 --> 04:58.872
but I should have it
by the morning.

04:58.873 --> 05:01.177
Eh, or the next day.
That'll be fine.

05:01.178 --> 05:02.800
- Yes, it will. Yes, it will.
- Yeah, that could work.

05:02.801 --> 05:04.969
And I'll have to leave
Wilfred at home.

05:04.970 --> 05:08.240
- He can be kind of distracting.
- You know what, get it to me whenever.

05:08.241 --> 05:11.143
- Who wants a back rub?
- You've had your jollies.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.445
Can you give someone else
a turn, eh?

05:19.666 --> 05:22.302
First day on the job,
and I totally killed it.

05:22.303 --> 05:26.940
Felicia in Accounting, she
puts on this whale sound CD,

05:26.941 --> 05:30.243
and I'm like, "What's that
sound? What's that sound?

05:30.244 --> 05:32.312
What's that sound?"

05:32.313 --> 05:34.748
And, of course, I knew it
was a whale the whole time.

05:36.117 --> 05:37.384
Well, you see,
I was pretending.

05:37.385 --> 05:39.152
That's the bit.

05:39.153 --> 05:41.555
Yeah, well, anyway,
it was pretty cute.

05:44.626 --> 05:46.827
To the first happy hour
we've seen in months.

05:46.828 --> 05:48.896
We should probably toast
to Wilfred, right?

05:48.897 --> 05:50.497
I mean, the effect
he had on Jeremy,

05:50.498 --> 05:51.765
it's like magic.

05:51.766 --> 05:54.368
Actually, it's chemistry.

05:54.369 --> 05:57.538
Contact with dogs causes the
human brain to release oxytocin,

05:57.539 --> 05:59.406
which is the same hormone
that mothers produce

05:59.407 --> 06:01.108
when they're nursing
their babies.

06:01.109 --> 06:04.978
Is it weird that I'm so
turned on by how smart you are?

06:04.979 --> 06:07.147
Would it turn you on even more

06:07.148 --> 06:08.815
if I answered that
question in Latin?

06:08.816 --> 06:11.184
Es-yay.

06:11.185 --> 06:13.053
What are you doing
this weekend?

06:13.054 --> 06:14.287
Getting older.

06:14.288 --> 06:16.122
Friday's my birthday.

06:16.123 --> 06:18.225
- Do you have any plans?
- I don't know.

06:18.226 --> 06:21.028
I was thinking maybe a
Swanson's chicken potpie

06:21.029 --> 06:23.430
and huff some keyboard cleaner,
see where that takes me.

06:23.431 --> 06:26.433
Or I could take you
out to dinner

06:26.434 --> 06:28.402
and we could huff
keyboard cleaner together.

06:28.403 --> 06:31.672
Okay, but I only huff
the good stuff.

06:31.673 --> 06:33.707
I'm kind of a
keyboard cleaner snob.

06:33.708 --> 06:35.909
Ah.

06:35.910 --> 06:37.811
No, but seriously, that
would be really nice.

06:40.048 --> 06:42.816
And then Judith in PR,

06:42.817 --> 06:44.952
who apparently
never laughs, says,

06:44.953 --> 06:47.355
"look, he's got scotch tape
on the bottom of his paw."

06:47.356 --> 06:49.123
And you know what?

06:49.124 --> 06:50.992
I did!

06:50.993 --> 06:53.260
I absolutely did.

06:53.261 --> 06:57.030
Oh, we all had a real good laugh
at that one, let me tell you.

06:57.031 --> 06:59.733
Anyway, guys,
I better get back to my friends.

06:59.734 --> 07:02.502
Uh, it was good
chatting with you.

07:02.503 --> 07:04.304
I'll kill you!

07:16.784 --> 07:19.419
I brought balls!

07:19.420 --> 07:21.287
Balls!

07:21.288 --> 07:23.423
Balls outside
the conference room!

07:23.424 --> 07:24.847
You like balls?

07:24.848 --> 07:26.359
Yay, Ryan brought his dog in
again today.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.127
Is this going to
be an everyday thing?

07:28.128 --> 07:31.297
Ryan, could you, like, put
your dog in your office?

07:31.298 --> 07:32.731
Yeah, he's cute, but,
you know...

07:32.732 --> 07:33.932
- Yeah, okay, okay.
- Balls, balls.

07:33.933 --> 07:35.200
- Come on.
- Balls! Balls! Balls!

07:35.201 --> 07:36.501
- Wilfred...
- Balls! Balls! Balls!

07:36.502 --> 07:38.036
Wilfred, in my office now!

07:40.073 --> 07:42.574
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

07:44.543 --> 07:46.211
I'm bombing out there.

07:46.212 --> 07:48.446
Not a single laugh.

07:48.447 --> 07:50.481
Not even an "aw."
It's bullshit!

07:50.482 --> 07:51.850
Ow!

07:51.851 --> 07:53.785
- Aw.
- This is no joke.

07:53.786 --> 07:56.922
I'm an office dog.

07:56.923 --> 07:59.224
It's my duty
to entertain and amuse,

07:59.225 --> 08:01.126
and if I can't do it,
they'll bring in

08:01.127 --> 08:03.195
some foosball table who can!

08:03.196 --> 08:05.731
Yeah, in this economy,
there's plenty

08:05.732 --> 08:07.600
of hungry young tables
that'll work for nothing.

08:09.202 --> 08:11.337
- Suck my dick, Ryan.
- Lighten up.

08:11.338 --> 08:15.174
After two days, the novelty
of an office dog has worn thin.

08:15.175 --> 08:17.209
So what? Jeremy likes you.

08:17.210 --> 08:19.345
That guy rubs me the wrong way.

08:19.346 --> 08:21.814
Literally,
like, against the grain.

08:21.815 --> 08:23.950
From tail to head.

08:23.951 --> 08:26.652
- Who does that?
- He's in a good mood.

08:26.653 --> 08:28.888
That's all that matters.
Well, that's all that matters to you.

08:30.124 --> 08:32.458
They loved me once.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.428
I don't understand.

08:35.429 --> 08:37.197
Why am I slipping?

08:40.101 --> 08:43.136
Slipping.

08:43.138 --> 08:45.273
That's it.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.645
What are you going to do?

08:50.646 --> 08:52.447
Something big, something epic.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.583
Something people
will be talking about

08:54.584 --> 08:56.818
for the rest of their morning.

08:56.819 --> 08:59.120
- Possibly through to lunch.
- Wilfred, please.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.955
Hey! Everyone,

09:00.956 --> 09:03.290
look at me.

09:03.291 --> 09:04.758
I'm going to run

09:04.759 --> 09:07.661
and make a sharp turn
into the break room.

09:07.662 --> 09:10.865
I'm sure that my paws will have
no trouble getting traction

09:10.866 --> 09:14.201
on this slippery polished
concrete floor.

09:14.202 --> 09:15.469
Wait. W-Wilfred, don't!

09:17.773 --> 09:19.908
Oh, great.

09:19.909 --> 09:22.109
Jesus, Ryan.
I just had a salty lunch.

09:22.110 --> 09:23.744
Ricky to the rescue!

09:24.913 --> 09:26.180
Are you not entertained?

09:28.317 --> 09:30.585
Are you not entertained?

09:30.586 --> 09:32.853
What is wrong with you people?!

09:32.854 --> 09:35.155
What the hell
is going on out here? Huh?

09:35.156 --> 09:36.457
And why is everybody
just standing around?

09:36.458 --> 09:38.325
Except for you, Ricky.

09:38.326 --> 09:40.160
You're doing
a great job, as always.

09:40.161 --> 09:42.496
Ryan's dog knocked over
the water cooler.

09:42.497 --> 09:44.698
I don't give a shit
about the water cooler.

09:44.699 --> 09:47.101
I just got off the phone
with my source from Kanner/McKay

09:47.102 --> 09:49.370
who told me that they
are developing a compound

09:49.371 --> 09:51.305
that is nearly
identical to ours.

09:51.306 --> 09:53.574
And I swear to God,
if those clowns

09:53.575 --> 09:55.843
come up with a cure
for lung cancer,

09:55.844 --> 09:58.479
it is going to be
a sad, sad day.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.415
Everyone, work now!

10:01.416 --> 10:02.917
Ryan!

10:02.918 --> 10:04.752
Where's my CNVN report?

10:04.753 --> 10:06.521
Oh, I thought you said I could

10:06.522 --> 10:08.290
- get that to you whenever.
- Whenever?

10:08.291 --> 10:11.026
Does that sound like the type
of thing a person who puts

10:11.027 --> 10:14.596
$50 million of his own
on the line would say?

10:14.597 --> 10:16.398
When am I
going to get it?

10:16.399 --> 10:17.465
Is Monday okay?

10:17.466 --> 10:18.633
Tomorrow.

10:18.634 --> 10:20.135
Possible?

10:20.136 --> 10:21.837
You, not being a dick,
possible?

10:21.838 --> 10:23.305
Tomorrow, Friday?

10:23.306 --> 10:25.875
But that patent is
three inches thick.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.343
Three inches?

10:28.344 --> 10:33.644
Stacey, have we sent Ryan
the CNVN311 addendum yet?

10:45.756 --> 10:48.391
I hereby tender
my resignation as office dog.

10:48.392 --> 10:52.463
Well, it'll be a pretty
big blow to the company.

10:52.464 --> 10:54.765
Don't forget to schedule an exit
interview with the snow globe.

10:54.766 --> 10:57.534
I'm serious, Ryan.
I'm not going back there.

10:57.535 --> 10:59.201
Those idiots
wouldn't know adorable

10:59.202 --> 11:01.367
if it cornered them
in a holding cell

11:01.368 --> 11:03.302
and raped them
with a plunger handle.

11:03.303 --> 11:06.272
That reminds me...
Bear, can you pick up a plunger

11:06.273 --> 11:07.774
- before our next date night?
- Wilfred,

11:07.775 --> 11:09.542
you have to come back
to the office with me.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.211
I'm never going to
finish this in time.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.113
You need to put Jeremy
in a good mood

11:13.114 --> 11:14.514
so I can ask for an extension.

11:14.515 --> 11:16.783
If I have to cancel
on Amanda again,

11:16.784 --> 11:19.252
- I'm afraid she'll give up on me.
- You don't need me.

11:19.253 --> 11:21.555
You just need to quit whining
and get some self-respect.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.557
I mean, this is your father
all over again.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.726
- What are you talking about?
- You never stood up to him, either.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.195
So intimidated.

11:27.196 --> 11:28.930
So desperate for approval.

11:28.931 --> 11:32.066
Can't even check "no"
on an RSVP card.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.735
Oh...

11:33.736 --> 11:35.770
Don't tell me you want to go

11:35.771 --> 11:37.706
to your father's
black-tie circle jerk.

11:37.707 --> 11:39.307
Stop psychoanalyzing me.

11:39.308 --> 11:40.608
It's two completely
different situations.

11:40.609 --> 11:41.943
Really, Ryan?

11:41.944 --> 11:44.145
Jeremy's nothing
like your father?

11:44.146 --> 11:47.448
So, when that stern
authority figure

11:47.449 --> 11:49.184
makes unreasonable
demands of you,

11:49.185 --> 11:50.685
you don't feel weak
and powerless?

11:50.686 --> 11:53.621
Your palms don't sweat?

11:53.622 --> 11:55.456
And your stomach
doesn't twist into knots?

11:55.457 --> 11:58.092
You don't fool me, Ryan.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.128
You may wear
big-boy pants now,

12:00.129 --> 12:02.096
but underneath it all,

12:02.097 --> 12:04.098
you've still got that same
little-boy penis.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.201
You're coming back to the
office with me, and that's it.

12:06.202 --> 12:07.435
No way.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.403
Not unless you help me

12:09.404 --> 12:11.405
come up with some new material.

12:11.406 --> 12:12.873
I have to finish
this by tomorrow.

12:12.874 --> 12:14.475
You think I have time to
teach you a new trick?

12:14.476 --> 12:17.778
No, I need to come up
with a whole new adorable act.

12:19.313 --> 12:20.948
Better put on a pot of coffee.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.716
This is probably
going to take us all night.

12:22.717 --> 12:24.351
Us?

12:24.352 --> 12:26.287
Oh, your ass just got jinxed.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.055
Nice one, Bear!

12:28.056 --> 12:30.090
You owe him a coke, by the way.

12:35.908 --> 12:38.176
Wilfred
Come on.

12:38.177 --> 12:40.077
Adorable, adorable, adorable.
What's adorable?

12:40.078 --> 12:41.879
How about this?

12:41.880 --> 12:44.448
I lie down on the floor
and pretend I'm asleep.

12:44.449 --> 12:47.018
Then I start twitching
and making cute little noises,

12:47.019 --> 12:48.853
like I'm dreaming
about chasing a rabbit

12:48.854 --> 12:50.889
through a field of clouds.
Cute shit, right?

12:50.890 --> 12:54.058
- Sure, whatever.
- Ah, that's not it!

12:54.059 --> 12:56.394
Better write that down, Bear.
There might be something there.

12:56.395 --> 12:58.563
Wilfred, we've been
at this all night.

12:58.564 --> 12:59.831
Well, maybe we'd
be done if you'd

12:59.832 --> 13:01.633
focus on making me
look adorable

13:01.634 --> 13:03.869
instead of goofing around
with your little legal brief.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.537
All right.

13:05.538 --> 13:08.039
What about, I don't know,
sad, droopy dog eyes?

13:09.508 --> 13:11.309
What the...?
Are you kidding me?

13:11.310 --> 13:14.812
Lassie was doing sad,
droopy dog eyes back in 1955.

13:14.813 --> 13:16.180
That shit is hack.

13:18.049 --> 13:19.817
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,
what about this?

13:19.818 --> 13:21.518
Okay, I'm sitting down

13:21.519 --> 13:24.921
doing nothing,
then, suddenly, I lift my head,

13:24.922 --> 13:27.023
cock my ears
and look really alert...

13:28.626 --> 13:31.528
for absolutely no reason.

13:31.529 --> 13:33.396
That's great.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.498
Honestly, the fact
that you think it's great

13:35.499 --> 13:37.467
makes me think it's not great.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.568
What's that?

13:40.537 --> 13:42.604
Oh, really?

13:42.605 --> 13:44.439
Okay,
this will be interesting.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.141
Bear's got a pitch.
Okay, let's hear it.

13:50.546 --> 13:54.216
Oh, that sounds
pretty good, huh?

13:54.217 --> 13:56.752
Really?

13:56.753 --> 13:58.520
If it's so good,
why did you interrupt Bear

13:58.521 --> 14:00.056
in the middle of his pitch?

14:00.057 --> 14:01.824
Go on, Bear.

14:04.028 --> 14:05.361
What, what, that's it?

14:05.362 --> 14:07.063
That's the pitch?

14:09.866 --> 14:12.734
For God sakes, Wilfred, just pick
something... anything.

14:12.735 --> 14:16.137
Maybe you're right.
We got to have something here.

14:16.138 --> 14:18.273
Let me just check
through these notes.

14:19.508 --> 14:20.742
What the...?

14:20.743 --> 14:23.511
Are you kidding me?

14:23.512 --> 14:26.448
45 pages of lower-case H's?

14:26.449 --> 14:27.983
What, have you been writing
none of this down?

14:27.984 --> 14:30.352
- Jesus, Bear!
- Wilfred, calm down!

14:30.353 --> 14:32.087
How could I calm down?!
We've got nothing, Ryan!

14:32.088 --> 14:35.056
Nothing!

14:35.057 --> 14:36.725
You are a disgrace!

14:36.726 --> 14:38.760
I can't even look
at you right now.

14:38.761 --> 14:40.362
Where's your sex bag?

14:50.239 --> 14:52.474
Wilfred... look.

14:56.279 --> 14:58.514
Of course.

14:58.515 --> 15:01.751
Bear, you are a genius.

15:01.752 --> 15:04.020
Bag on my head,
and I can't get it off.

15:04.021 --> 15:06.056
Bag on my head,
and I can't get it off!

15:06.057 --> 15:07.357
Okay, new plan.

15:07.358 --> 15:09.225
Bear, you sit over here.
Ryan, you type.

15:11.896 --> 15:14.364
Jeremy?

15:14.365 --> 15:16.299
Can I talk to you for a second?

15:16.300 --> 15:18.134
You got my report?

15:18.135 --> 15:20.336
Actually, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.206
But before we do that, I assume
you want to say good morning

15:23.207 --> 15:24.975
to your favorite...

15:26.611 --> 15:29.046
Wilfred?

15:29.047 --> 15:30.380
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:30.381 --> 15:32.315
how's everybody
doing this morning?

15:32.316 --> 15:34.017
It's good to be back here
in the office.

15:34.018 --> 15:35.619
Uh, how many people work here?
A show of hands?

15:37.089 --> 15:38.556
Okay, uh, I'll just...

15:38.557 --> 15:39.991
I'll just get
straight into it, then.

15:39.992 --> 15:41.926
Um...

15:41.927 --> 15:45.430
Hey! Where did this
paper bag come from?

15:45.431 --> 15:47.266
Kevin, did you eat
all the jalapenos

15:47.267 --> 15:48.834
off my cheddar
jalapeno bagel again?

15:48.835 --> 15:51.269
No. No. Why?

15:51.270 --> 15:53.004
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:53.005 --> 15:55.007
I'm excited about tonight.

15:55.008 --> 15:56.675
Me, too.

15:56.676 --> 15:58.911
So, it seems
there's this bag...

15:58.912 --> 16:01.446
Athletic injury
in your sleep.

16:01.447 --> 16:04.116
Excuse me, do I come into
your place of business

16:04.117 --> 16:06.051
and interrupt you
when you're working?

16:06.052 --> 16:07.419
Anyway,
back to the bag.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.688
I wonder what's inside.

16:09.689 --> 16:11.022
Careful, doggy!

16:11.023 --> 16:13.991
Don't get your head
stuck in a bag.

16:13.992 --> 16:16.160
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Hey, look at me.

16:16.161 --> 16:18.762
I'm a dumb dog.

16:18.763 --> 16:20.497
Oh, very cute, Ricky.

16:23.302 --> 16:24.502
You bastard!

16:24.503 --> 16:26.704
Did you see that?!

16:26.705 --> 16:29.807
Slow Piscopo stole my bit
right out from under me!

16:29.808 --> 16:31.675
You know what you need...
a good belly rub.

16:31.676 --> 16:33.644
And I think Jeremy's available.

16:33.645 --> 16:36.047
Hi, guys! Toilet time.

16:36.048 --> 16:37.983
Shouldn't you be out
terrifying white-water rafters

16:37.984 --> 16:40.686
with your banjo music?

16:40.687 --> 16:42.654
Hey, Ricky, could you
give us a minute?

16:42.655 --> 16:44.423
But... but it's toilet time.

16:45.859 --> 16:48.327
Hi, doggy!

16:49.696 --> 16:51.330
Wilfred! Wilfred!

16:55.249 --> 16:57.717
Again, I am...
I am so, so sorry about this.

16:57.718 --> 16:59.385
Go get help!
Shh!

16:59.386 --> 17:00.920
It's really not that bad.

17:00.921 --> 17:02.922
Let me
out of here, Ryan!

17:02.923 --> 17:05.492
Why did he hurt my face?

17:05.492 --> 17:06.694
I love him.
I know.

17:08.563 --> 17:10.564
I look terrible!

17:10.565 --> 17:12.232
Don't worry, pretty boy.

17:12.233 --> 17:14.134
- You still got your quick wit.
- Listen, Ricky,

17:14.135 --> 17:16.569
it's very important that we
don't tell anyone about this.

17:16.570 --> 17:18.906
Okay? I could lose my job.

17:18.906 --> 17:22.277
I could forget about it

17:22.278 --> 17:25.146
if you do my job.

17:27.949 --> 17:29.950
Are you blackmailing me?

17:29.951 --> 17:33.454
Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

17:33.455 --> 17:36.457
I'm not really sure
what blackmailing means.

17:40.428 --> 17:42.629
Do it!

17:45.133 --> 17:48.102
That
dude is such a slowpoke.

17:48.103 --> 17:50.537
I mean, talk about dumb.

17:50.538 --> 17:52.273
The guy redefines...
Ah, shit!

17:52.274 --> 17:54.375
Enough, Wilfred.
I'm not in the mood.

17:54.376 --> 17:56.077
Oh, now you put your foot down.

17:56.078 --> 17:57.912
You could have been off
experimenting

17:57.913 --> 17:59.880
with that scientist chick
right now

17:59.881 --> 18:01.315
if you just stood up
for yourself.

18:01.316 --> 18:03.117
What? This all happened
because of your

18:03.118 --> 18:05.185
- insatiable need for attention.
- No, Ryan.

18:05.186 --> 18:07.188
This happened because
you're a human door mat.

18:07.189 --> 18:10.591
Either help me
or get out of here.

18:10.592 --> 18:12.559
You're doing a shit job
at that shit job.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.628
Jesus, are you good at anything?

18:14.629 --> 18:16.931
No wonder you're so starved
for your father's approval.

18:16.932 --> 18:18.532
You never did anything
to earn it.

18:18.533 --> 18:21.932
That's not true.
I did everything to earn it.

18:21.933 --> 18:23.208
Well, maybe you didn't
try hard enough.

18:23.209 --> 18:24.457
I couldn't have tried
any harder.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.726
Then maybe you're
not good enough.

18:25.727 --> 18:27.094
Well, then, screw you!

18:27.095 --> 18:29.138
I'm a great lawyer,
and I was a great son.

18:29.139 --> 18:30.044
Look, I did everything right,

18:30.045 --> 18:32.313
and all I got
in return was shit.

18:32.314 --> 18:34.415
Well, I'm done!

18:34.416 --> 18:36.451
Say it again.

18:40.222 --> 18:42.357
I'm done.

18:43.859 --> 18:45.460
Ah, shit!

18:46.461 --> 18:48.361
Ah, Ryan.

18:48.362 --> 18:50.397
Look, Jeremy,

18:50.398 --> 18:52.131
I will not be finishing
that report by tomorrow.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.599
I have a date tonight.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.468
I'm good at my job,
and I will work

18:55.469 --> 18:58.104
my ass off for you,
but only if we set some limits.

18:58.105 --> 18:59.706
- First...
- You got it.

18:59.707 --> 19:01.307
I do?

19:01.308 --> 19:03.276
Yeah, whatever you want.

19:03.277 --> 19:05.278
- Really?
- Totally.

19:05.279 --> 19:06.379
See you Monday.

19:12.420 --> 19:13.688
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

19:13.689 --> 19:16.157
Order me a keyboard cleaner.

19:16.158 --> 19:17.925
That was incredible.

19:17.926 --> 19:19.426
I had no idea it'd be so easy

19:19.427 --> 19:21.294
to get what I wanted
from Jeremy.

19:21.295 --> 19:24.230
Me, neither. I was like 99% sure
you were going to get fired.

19:36.011 --> 19:37.945
You're an inspiration, Ryan.
You hear me?

19:37.946 --> 19:42.817
In fact, I'm going to go give
Jeremy a piece of my mind.

19:42.818 --> 19:46.187
- Tail to head, my ass.
- Wilfred!

19:46.188 --> 19:48.023
Jeremy...

19:48.024 --> 19:49.858
Sorry, Jeremy. I...

19:55.197 --> 19:57.632
You know, I think I'm
going to take next week off.

19:57.633 --> 19:59.534
Possible?

20:01.036 --> 20:03.004
Very, very possible.

20:03.005 --> 20:04.605
Go.

20:30.432 --> 20:32.800
Oh, my God.

20:32.801 --> 20:34.869
It's the 21st century.

20:34.870 --> 20:37.139
I can't believe you
still believe that.

20:37.140 --> 20:39.977
Let's just assume for a second
that the world really is round,

20:39.978 --> 20:42.279
like you say.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.049
The good people of America
are right here on top.

20:45.050 --> 20:49.153
And the Chinese folk
are on the bottom.

20:49.154 --> 20:52.291
Why do they not just fall off?

20:52.292 --> 20:53.692
What, you expect me to believe

20:53.693 --> 20:55.127
they have magnets
in their shoes?

20:55.128 --> 20:57.663
It's not magnets.
It's gravity.

20:57.664 --> 21:01.500
- And it's in their shoes?
- Yes.
