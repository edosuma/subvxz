00:18.294 --> 00:20.710
NARRATOR: Everyone brought theirpersonalities to the table.

00:20.813 --> 00:22.608
Help yourself, Chef.

00:22.712 --> 00:23.644

00:23.747 --> 00:24.921
You've got a "Hell's
Kitchen" tattoo.

00:25.025 --> 00:25.922
I do.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.235
I have seafood
tattooed all over me.

00:28.338 --> 00:31.514
NARRATOR: But despite effortsfrom Motto, Mia, and Bret

00:31.617 --> 00:32.929
to win over the room--

00:33.033 --> 00:34.517
I have the ballots filled out.

NARRATOR: --the chefs tookturns running the pass--

00:46.218 --> 00:47.530

quality-control tests

00:50.602 --> 00:51.603
along the way.

00:51.706 --> 00:53.812
I completely forgot
about the sabotages.

00:53.915 --> 00:56.228
NARRATOR: Each of the fourchefs missed one sabotage.

00:56.332 --> 00:57.126
Taste that.

00:57.229 --> 00:58.092
Oh, shit.

00:58.196 --> 00:59.024
It's orzo.

00:59.128 --> 01:00.577
Fuck.

01:00.681 --> 01:02.234
The pork needs to
be cooked longer.

01:02.338 --> 01:03.373
What is it?

01:03.477 --> 01:04.581
- Veal chop.
- Veal.

01:04.685 --> 01:05.789
That's right.
What's it look like?

01:05.893 --> 01:07.101
Come on.
- Ribeye.

01:07.205 --> 01:08.620

Two New Yorks.

01:10.035 --> 01:12.072
NARRATOR: But redeemedthemselves by catching another.

01:12.175 --> 01:14.039
Chef, this is lobster,
right, not monkfish?

01:14.143 --> 01:15.420
You're absolutely right.Well spotted.

01:15.523 --> 01:16.317
It is monkfish.

01:16.421 --> 01:17.387
Yes, chef.

01:17.491 --> 01:19.769
I need two beeftartare, not tuna tartare.

01:19.872 --> 01:20.908
Well spotted.

01:21.011 --> 01:21.805
No spaghetti, please.

01:21.909 --> 01:23.048
Can I get a fix on that?

01:23.152 --> 01:24.084
Well spotted.

01:24.187 --> 01:25.499
I can do this shit
in my sleep, man.

01:25.602 --> 01:27.880
We all had some highs,and we all had some lows.

01:27.984 --> 01:29.261
Yes, Chef.

01:29.365 --> 01:31.746
NARRATOR: Not surprisingly,it was difficult to determine

01:31.850 --> 01:32.782
who should go home.

01:32.885 --> 01:33.990
Man, I've got this, y'all.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.371
NARRATOR: But "Hell's
Kitchen" first-timer

01:35.474 --> 01:38.305
Motto took the decision
into his own hands--

01:38.408 --> 01:40.030
I'm going to put myself up.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.792
Holy fucking curveball, Motto.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.518
NARRATOR: And
shocked Chef Ramsay--

01:44.621 --> 01:46.382
I put forth myself.

01:46.485 --> 01:48.108
NARRATOR: --when he
bowed out to return

01:48.211 --> 01:50.248
home and pursue a new dream.

01:50.351 --> 01:52.284
I don't want to give
up on Baton Rouge.

01:52.388 --> 01:54.873
I want to go back and sharethis wealth of knowledge

01:54.976 --> 01:56.150
that you've given me.

01:56.254 --> 01:57.047
Wow.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.635
Motto, step forward.

01:58.739 --> 02:02.018
Once you're done in
Baton Rouge, call me.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.019
Yes, Chef.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.710
NARRATOR: And thus
gave up his chance

02:04.814 --> 02:06.885
to become the executive
chef at Gordon

02:06.988 --> 02:08.473
Ramsay's Hell's
Kitchen restaurant

02:08.576 --> 02:11.027
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.236
With three chefs
remaining, Chef Ramsay

02:13.340 --> 02:14.444
named his first finalist.

02:14.548 --> 02:15.894
- Ariel.
- Thank you.

02:15.997 --> 02:17.758
I'm ready to fight for
this to the end, Chef.

02:17.861 --> 02:21.175
NARRATOR: Tonight we find outwho will be finalist number two

02:21.279 --> 02:24.178
and go up against Ariel

02:24.282 --> 02:26.560
Somebody else will
be leaving tonight.

02:29.390 --> 02:32.255
NARRATOR: And it happensright now on the continuation

02:32.359 --> 02:33.463
of "Hell's Kitchen."

02:33.567 --> 02:39.297
The second person movingon to the grand finale

02:39.400 --> 02:50.860
alongside Ariel is Mia.

02:53.449 --> 02:54.760
Congratulations.

02:54.864 --> 02:55.658
Thank you.

02:55.761 --> 02:56.762
Congratulations, Mia.

02:57.763 --> 02:58.557
Thank you.

02:58.661 --> 03:00.007
Come here.

03:00.110 --> 03:01.215
Congratulations.

03:01.319 --> 03:02.492
Good job.

03:02.596 --> 03:05.668
I made it to the finale.

03:05.771 --> 03:09.396
And I've taken so muchcrap from so many people.

03:09.499 --> 03:12.088
But none of it matters,
because I'm here.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.055
You'd better fucking win.

03:14.159 --> 03:16.955
Young man, come here.

03:17.058 --> 03:18.750
Listen carefully.

03:18.853 --> 03:20.786
You're probably one ofthe most passionate chefs

03:20.890 --> 03:23.582
ever to grace this floor.

03:23.686 --> 03:26.723
Right now, I know your
parents are looking down

03:26.827 --> 03:30.624
and are absolutely in
awe of what you've done.

03:30.727 --> 03:32.212
And I wish you
nothing but the best.

03:32.315 --> 03:33.316
Goodbye, Chef.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.180
I don't want that jacket.

03:35.284 --> 03:36.802
From the bottom of my
heart, Chef, thank you.

03:36.906 --> 03:38.079
- Bye, Chef.
- Thank you.

03:38.183 --> 03:39.598
You know, if you ever
[inaudible] again,

03:39.702 --> 03:40.599
hit me up, Chef.
- Yeah.

03:40.703 --> 03:41.600
Thank you for everything.

03:48.918 --> 03:50.851
You know, it sucks
that I didn't win.

03:50.954 --> 03:53.509
But I'm blessed to have beenback in this opportunity.

03:53.612 --> 03:56.374
Next up, the Italian
stallion, Bret.

03:56.477 --> 03:59.066
What brought me
back is my passion.

03:59.169 --> 03:59.963
You OK?

04:00.067 --> 04:00.999
Yeah.

04:01.102 --> 04:02.103
Just tasting my risotto.

04:02.207 --> 04:05.348
My risotto is on the
Hell's Kitchen menu.

04:05.452 --> 04:06.246
Bret.

04:06.349 --> 04:07.177
[applause]

04:07.281 --> 04:08.593
Fuck, yeah.

04:08.696 --> 04:09.732
Aargh!

04:09.835 --> 04:13.218
With extreme passion
comes extreme emotion.

04:13.322 --> 04:14.806
Highs and lows, you know.

04:14.909 --> 04:15.945
What happened?

04:16.048 --> 04:17.602
I'm back, ain't I?

04:17.705 --> 04:19.086
I see tears.
What happened?

04:19.189 --> 04:20.225
They're tears
of joy, you know.

04:20.329 --> 04:21.882
For me, it's hearty,
delicious, rustic

04:21.985 --> 04:23.780
gnocchi, catapulted
into the premier league

04:23.884 --> 04:25.437
of items on the menu.

04:25.541 --> 04:26.921
It was a crazy journey.

04:27.025 --> 04:29.924
I've learned so much, Icould write a book about it.

04:30.028 --> 04:31.271
[cheers]

04:31.374 --> 04:32.237
Hell, yeah.

04:32.341 --> 04:34.412
Mama, this one's
for you right there.

04:34.515 --> 04:37.656
With the death of both myparents, I gained two angels.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.451
The reason I'm a chef is
because of my parents,

04:39.555 --> 04:40.590
you know what I'm saying?

04:40.694 --> 04:42.523
Yeah, I know my parents
are real proud of me.

04:42.627 --> 04:44.836
I know they're proud.

04:44.939 --> 04:45.837
Listen carefully.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.874
Right now, you two
talented ladies

04:48.978 --> 04:50.704
need to go to work
on designing an

04:50.807 --> 04:53.741
incredible finale-winning menu.

04:53.845 --> 04:54.639
Mia.

04:54.742 --> 04:55.571
Yes, Chef.

04:55.674 --> 04:58.125
Your sous chef will be Jocky.

04:58.228 --> 05:01.093
Ariel, Christina will
be your sous chef.

05:01.197 --> 05:03.130
Now, plan these menus
out accordingly.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.235
Think about the message
you're trying to send

05:05.339 --> 05:07.307
to a fully booked dining room.

05:07.410 --> 05:08.722
Yes, Chef.

05:08.825 --> 05:09.895
Head back to the dorms.
Well done.

05:09.999 --> 05:10.965
Thank you, Chef.

05:11.069 --> 05:11.828
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you so much.

05:11.932 --> 05:12.173
- Good night.
- Good night.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.489
Congratulations.

05:17.593 --> 05:20.768
I'm in the fucking
finale of HK 18.

05:20.872 --> 05:22.080
I can't fucking believe it.

05:22.183 --> 05:24.703
I'm in shock right now.

05:24.807 --> 05:26.636
I can't believe it.

05:26.740 --> 05:28.155
It's crazy.

05:28.258 --> 05:31.607
[music playing]

06:01.464 --> 06:02.741
Are there some
finalists in here?

06:05.572 --> 06:07.643
Congratulations, ladies.

06:07.746 --> 06:08.713
It's you.

06:08.816 --> 06:09.783
So they told us.

06:09.886 --> 06:10.680
Hi.
Congratulations.

06:10.784 --> 06:11.612
Thank you.

06:11.716 --> 06:12.510
You did a good job.

06:12.613 --> 06:13.407
Thank you.

06:13.511 --> 06:14.650
OK, we'll sit and talk here.

06:14.753 --> 06:16.410
I'm going to go
get my notebook.

06:16.514 --> 06:19.413
I couldn't be happier that Igot paired with Chef Christina.

06:19.517 --> 06:21.795
She obviously has
valuable insight.

06:21.898 --> 06:24.211
So I think this is a good match.

06:24.314 --> 06:27.076
The whole idea is like
Spanish or Latin flavors

06:27.179 --> 06:29.216
and Asian flavors together.

06:29.319 --> 06:34.221
We have a hot app, which is theWagyu tataki arepas, the pollo

06:34.324 --> 06:37.224
a la Brasa, and then
the mackerel, which

06:37.327 --> 06:38.915
is like a Vera Cruz style.

06:39.019 --> 06:42.471
Do you think mackerel isapproachable for most people?

06:45.508 --> 06:46.302
Just curious.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.234
I just, you know--

06:47.337 --> 06:49.581
No, it's good.

06:49.685 --> 06:50.479
All right.

06:50.582 --> 06:51.756
What do I need to know?

06:51.859 --> 06:54.724
It's all kind of,obviously, Latin in nature.

06:54.828 --> 06:57.106
I'm excited about my menu.

06:57.209 --> 07:00.420
Do you know what
mofongo is, Chef?

07:00.523 --> 07:03.043
It's a traditional
Puerto Rican dish.

07:03.146 --> 07:05.321
It's funny, because
I'm very Latin.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.979
And I know, like,
all my Latin food.

07:08.082 --> 07:09.636
And he's from the
UK, so I'm kind

07:09.739 --> 07:10.706
of having to explain to him.

07:10.809 --> 07:11.776
I don't know.

07:11.879 --> 07:13.122
You don't think, like,
do the croquettes

07:13.225 --> 07:15.469
as a traditional croquette?

07:15.573 --> 07:17.471
No, I don't want to do
a traditional croquette.

07:17.575 --> 07:18.817
I want to put my spin on it.

07:18.921 --> 07:21.993
Like, I want to, like, bringthe Puerto Rican to it.

07:22.096 --> 07:24.133
You also want to
win the competition.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.962
Working with
Chef Jocky's great.

07:26.066 --> 07:28.655
He works at Michelin-starredrestaurants.

07:28.758 --> 07:30.208
I love his input.

07:30.311 --> 07:32.797
Just be careful that
we're not so repetitive.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.350
OK.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.248
I'm just trying to think,because I don't want

07:36.352 --> 07:37.802
them to have to do too much.

07:37.905 --> 07:39.286
You've just got to
get faith in the people.

07:39.389 --> 07:40.839
They're here to support you.

07:40.943 --> 07:42.151
I know.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.084
Most of the people in thiscompetition don't like me.

07:44.187 --> 07:44.981
Really?

07:45.085 --> 07:46.189
Yeah.

07:46.293 --> 07:49.089
I've gotten a lot ofhate from other teammates

07:49.192 --> 07:50.228
in this competition.

07:50.331 --> 07:52.955
And I don't want
them to sabotage me.

07:53.058 --> 07:54.232
Jesus Christ.

07:54.335 --> 07:55.578
This is who I'm voting for.

07:55.682 --> 07:57.235
OK, that's why
I stopped talking.

07:57.338 --> 07:59.340
Don't fucking attack me, dude.

07:59.444 --> 08:02.240
You do great in challenges,but you can't burn on the line.

08:02.343 --> 08:04.242
Yeah, I fucking can.

08:04.345 --> 08:05.968
She's trying to
play the blame game.

08:06.071 --> 08:08.867
She is lying right now.

08:08.971 --> 08:11.456
The only thing
I can do is lead.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.183
I'm here to back you up andget you through the final and--

08:14.286 --> 08:15.080
OK.

08:15.184 --> 08:16.254
--make you a winner.

08:16.357 --> 08:17.980
I feel good about the
apps and the entrees.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.775
I think they'll come
together nice, yeah.

08:19.878 --> 08:20.672
Welcome to the finale.

08:26.713 --> 08:28.784
NARRATOR: After workinglate into the night refining

08:28.887 --> 08:31.234
their finale menus
with their sous chefs,

08:31.338 --> 08:33.858
Ariel and Mia are
up early, ready

08:33.961 --> 08:35.238
for their final challenge.

08:35.342 --> 08:39.553
[phone rings]

08:39.657 --> 08:40.796
Good morning.
This is Mia.

08:40.899 --> 08:41.935
Good morning.

08:42.038 --> 08:44.213

08:56.190 --> 08:57.088

08:57.191 --> 08:58.503
Has it sunk in yet?

08:58.607 --> 08:59.746
- Yes, Chef.
- Yes, Chef.

08:59.849 --> 09:01.126
It did.

09:01.230 --> 09:03.232
This morning, I thought itwould be a good idea to give

09:03.335 --> 09:07.029
you guys a little inspiration.

09:07.132 --> 09:07.995
Mia.

Don't try to be perfect.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.431
Try to be yourself.

09:30.535 --> 09:33.814
[interposing voices]

09:33.918 --> 09:38.163
[cheers]

09:38.267 --> 09:39.786
It feels so good.

09:39.889 --> 09:40.994
It's my family.

09:41.097 --> 09:43.306
And it's been a whilesince I've talked to them.

09:43.410 --> 09:46.827
So just seeing them and hearingthe words of encouragement

09:46.931 --> 09:48.346
is just amazing.

09:48.449 --> 09:50.520
BOTH: Hi, Ariel.

I'm so proud of you.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.632
Keep doing what you do.

09:58.736 --> 09:59.771
That's all you
really need to do.

09:59.875 --> 10:02.394
That's all you've ever
really needed to do.

10:02.498 --> 10:03.810
You are in it to win it.

10:03.913 --> 10:05.190
Ariel for the win.

10:05.294 --> 10:07.434
Yay!

10:07.537 --> 10:08.538
Wow.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.643
Amazing.

10:09.747 --> 10:11.196
This is what I really needed.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.889
My parents, they
are my best friends.

10:13.992 --> 10:16.201
I'm an only child, so
it means a lot to be

10:16.305 --> 10:18.065
reminded that they support me.

10:18.169 --> 10:19.722
What lovely messages.

10:19.826 --> 10:21.310

10:21.413 --> 10:22.552
Makes the journey
worthwhile, right?

11:40.113 --> 11:42.322

11:42.425 --> 11:45.118
It feels great to see my parentscome through those doors.

11:45.221 --> 11:48.017

11:57.233 --> 11:58.959
Good to see you.

11:59.063 --> 12:00.547
Oh, my god.

12:00.650 --> 12:03.412
No, you didn't.

12:03.515 --> 12:07.899
I won all but two rewards,but this is by far

12:08.003 --> 12:09.798
the best one I've received.

12:09.901 --> 12:10.695
Thank you.

12:11.696 --> 12:12.766
Nice to meet you.

12:12.870 --> 12:13.698
Right.

12:13.802 --> 12:16.045
The challenge is
not till tomorrow.

12:16.149 --> 12:18.876
So I want you to relax andspend some valuable time

12:18.979 --> 12:19.773
with mom and dad, please.

12:19.877 --> 12:21.050
Thank you, Chef.

12:21.154 --> 12:23.570
I'm super close with myparents, so I'm just happy they

12:23.673 --> 12:25.192
get to come and be here.

12:25.296 --> 12:27.436
So what do you think?

12:27.539 --> 12:28.782
I can't believe it.

12:28.886 --> 12:30.646
I can't believe-- well, it'sjust weird to be back here

12:30.750 --> 12:32.579
and that you're
in the final two.

12:32.682 --> 12:35.202
I'm an only child, so I'vealways been very independent

12:35.306 --> 12:38.136
and always wanted to befinancially stable on my own.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.689
I moved out fairly young.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.623
But I've always known
that I could go home

12:42.727 --> 12:44.177
and get the support I need.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.697
So the prize is the first-everflagship Hell's Kitchen

12:47.801 --> 12:49.596
restaurant in Las Vegas.

12:49.699 --> 12:50.700
Oh, my goodness.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.427
So you've got to
get bicoastal again.

12:53.531 --> 12:55.636
Bicoastal, I know.

12:55.740 --> 12:59.295
Mom and Dad, I wouldn't haveeven a quarter of the work

12:59.399 --> 13:02.989
ethic, drive, morals,
values if it wasn't

13:03.092 --> 13:05.577
for your strong foundation.

13:05.681 --> 13:08.097
I am definitely a
product of both of you.

13:08.201 --> 13:10.824
And the apple did not
fall far from the tree.

13:10.928 --> 13:13.102
Mia's only lost two challenges.

13:13.206 --> 13:14.207
Oh, my gosh.

13:14.310 --> 13:17.072
She's going to be a
very tough competitor.

13:17.175 --> 13:18.245
You look wonderful, Mia.

13:18.349 --> 13:19.281
Gracias, Papa.

13:19.384 --> 13:20.385
Very emotional.

13:20.489 --> 13:23.009
This time with my
parents is so valuable.

13:23.112 --> 13:24.665
You look glowing.
You're glowing.

13:24.769 --> 13:25.563
You're really enjoying it.

13:25.666 --> 13:26.840
I'm proud of myself, yeah.

13:26.944 --> 13:28.324
You have to be proud.

13:28.428 --> 13:29.256
We're proud.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.671
We're super, super proud.

13:30.775 --> 13:31.672
Yeah.

13:31.776 --> 13:34.917
To me, it's all about
family and food.

13:35.021 --> 13:36.401
Those are my two passions.

13:36.505 --> 13:40.371
So just to be able to have themhere is really, really special.

13:40.474 --> 13:43.512
I was remembering your
poems in second grade.

13:43.615 --> 13:49.449
And it's like,
[spanish] and doing it.

13:49.552 --> 13:51.244
It's like you were
always into competing.

13:51.347 --> 13:52.728
But not running.

13:52.832 --> 13:53.625
No.

13:53.729 --> 13:54.799
No sports.

13:54.903 --> 13:57.629
My whole life, my whole
career, my whole family

13:57.733 --> 14:00.218
has been extremely
supportive, you know,

14:00.322 --> 14:01.357
even when I was a kid.

14:01.461 --> 14:03.152
And you know, I'm
not sporty at all.

14:03.256 --> 14:06.155
But they're just therecheering me on and pushing me

14:06.259 --> 14:09.710
and telling me I can do itand that, you know, if I fail,

14:09.814 --> 14:11.264
you know, just try again.

14:11.367 --> 14:12.817
They're my biggest fans.

14:12.921 --> 14:15.958
And I just want to make myfamily and my Puerto Rico

14:16.062 --> 14:17.684
proud.

14:17.787 --> 14:18.719
All right.

14:18.823 --> 14:20.480
Mums and dads,
first of all, thank

14:20.583 --> 14:21.999
you so much for being here.

14:22.102 --> 14:24.725
Ladies, we have a very, veryexciting day ahead of us.

14:24.829 --> 14:27.556
So please say goodbye
to mom and dad,

14:27.659 --> 14:28.868
because we've got
some work to do.

14:28.971 --> 14:30.317
All right.It's time to get to work.

14:30.421 --> 14:31.663
OK, baby.

14:31.767 --> 14:35.253

14:35.357 --> 14:36.703
[spanish]

14:36.806 --> 14:37.738
- We love you.
- Bye.

14:37.842 --> 14:38.947
- Love you.
- You're the bomb.

14:39.050 --> 14:40.051
This is great timing.

14:40.155 --> 14:41.950
It kind of took some
of the nerves away.

14:42.053 --> 14:43.020
Take care.

14:43.123 --> 14:45.056
You know, just enough
time to reconnect,

14:45.160 --> 14:47.127
and then back to business.

14:47.231 --> 14:48.059
How nice was that?

14:48.163 --> 14:49.543
- Amazing, Chef.
- Very nice, Chef.

14:49.647 --> 14:50.510
Wow.

14:50.613 --> 14:53.064
And as you are
the two finalists,

14:53.168 --> 14:58.449
I'd like to reward both ofyou with a fabulous brunch

14:58.552 --> 15:02.798
at one of my favoriterestaurants in LA, Republique.

- Thank you, Chef.
- Come on, sit down.

15:24.061 --> 15:25.372
I feel like a VIP.

15:25.476 --> 15:28.168
They have, like, this
private space upstairs.

15:28.272 --> 15:31.137
And it doesn't feel likethis is my life, but it is.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.966
It's like, pinch me.

15:33.070 --> 15:35.520
Congratulations
on the final two.

15:35.624 --> 15:36.418
What a morning.

15:36.521 --> 15:37.591
Yes.

15:37.695 --> 15:39.214
You guys have been on
quite a journey, right?

15:39.317 --> 15:40.353
Yes, Chef.

15:40.456 --> 15:43.149
I mean, first of all,
season six, ages ago.

15:43.252 --> 15:44.874
Season 18, you're in the finale.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.186
Such a long journey.

15:46.290 --> 15:47.532
It's crazy.

15:47.636 --> 15:52.641
For me, the services havebeen 100 times better for me.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.781
You seem to embrace
them so much better.

15:54.884 --> 15:56.438
- Yeah.
- With authority.

15:56.541 --> 15:57.370
Yes.

15:57.473 --> 15:58.474
What about low points?

15:58.578 --> 16:00.097
Low points.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.375
A low point for me is whenyou sent that raw halibut

16:02.478 --> 16:03.410
to Tilly's table.

16:03.514 --> 16:04.722
- Yes.
- Sweet 16.

16:04.825 --> 16:06.310
- Yes.
- Not so sweet.

16:06.413 --> 16:07.207
Not so sweet.

16:07.311 --> 16:10.038
I'm at a loss for words.

16:10.141 --> 16:11.625
This is Matilda's table.

16:11.729 --> 16:12.523
It's raw.

16:12.626 --> 16:14.456
Look, he just threw it.

16:14.559 --> 16:17.217
Like, the worst night tomess up on, for your daughter's

16:17.321 --> 16:18.115
Sweet 16.

16:18.218 --> 16:19.012
Yeah.

16:19.116 --> 16:20.151
Oh.

16:20.255 --> 16:21.428
He brought it up again.

16:21.532 --> 16:22.809
And he's like, looking medead in the eyes and like,

16:22.912 --> 16:24.293
l know your worst moment.

16:24.397 --> 16:26.192
It was on my
daughter's birthday.

16:26.295 --> 16:29.954
That was definitely thebiggest low for me this season.

16:30.058 --> 16:31.645
And Mia, highs and lows.

16:31.749 --> 16:35.339
The highs for me has beenhaving so many incredible chefs

16:35.442 --> 16:36.616
taste my food.

16:36.719 --> 16:38.411
Yeah, those scores have
been extraordinary.

16:38.514 --> 16:40.723
This is not only
visually beautiful, it's

16:40.827 --> 16:42.242
really delicious.
- Thank you, Chef.

16:42.346 --> 16:43.140
Very, very nice.

16:43.243 --> 16:44.900
Yeah, and I want more.

16:45.004 --> 16:45.797
TEAMMATE: Yes.

16:45.901 --> 16:46.833
TEAMMATE: Awesome.

16:46.936 --> 16:48.628
This is a delicious dish.

16:48.731 --> 16:50.906
It is worthy of being
on a menu right now.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.770
I think you've both
done incredibly well.

16:52.873 --> 16:54.565
Give us a little
insight to the menu.

16:54.668 --> 16:56.739
Mia, we have a veteran
versus a rookie.

16:56.843 --> 16:58.362
What message are
you trying to send?

16:58.465 --> 17:02.090
So, my menu, it's kind of acelebration of what I've done

17:02.193 --> 17:04.782
throughout the season
and influence from,

17:04.885 --> 17:08.372
you know, my life at home,different techniques.

17:08.475 --> 17:11.547
My first entree is atraditional Peruvian dish

17:11.651 --> 17:13.342
called pollo a la Brasa.

17:13.446 --> 17:14.999
Oh, my god.

17:15.103 --> 17:16.863
We both have a pollo a la Brasa.

17:16.966 --> 17:18.382
It sucks.

17:18.485 --> 17:21.523
I don't want to change my wholemenu just because Mia's doing

17:21.626 --> 17:23.145
a brick oven chicken as well.

17:23.249 --> 17:24.940
But we're going
to have a problem.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.183
Instead of doing
the whole chicken,

17:26.286 --> 17:28.219
I'm doing chicken
thighs, roasting them.

17:28.323 --> 17:30.566
And then I'm thinking ofthrowing them in the brick oven

17:30.670 --> 17:33.017
to get that skin, like,
really nice and crispy.

17:33.121 --> 17:34.018
Uh oh.

17:34.122 --> 17:35.192
Oh, our chicken entree
is very similar.

17:43.269 --> 17:45.133
NARRATOR: At a specialbrunch with Chef Ramsay--

17:45.236 --> 17:47.031
Congratulations
on the final two.

17:47.135 --> 17:48.998
NARRATOR: --veteran
Ariel has realized that

17:49.102 --> 17:50.621
her rookie competitor's menu--

17:50.724 --> 17:51.932
I'm doing chicken thighs.

17:52.036 --> 17:53.658
I'm thinking of throwing
them in the brick oven

17:53.762 --> 17:54.556
to be nice and crispy.

17:54.659 --> 17:55.591
Uh oh.

17:55.695 --> 17:56.937
Oh, our chicken entree
is very similar.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.492
NARRATOR: --might be alittle too close for comfort.

17:59.595 --> 18:03.323
Damn, battle of the chicken.

18:03.427 --> 18:07.327
My menu totally has what ittakes to edge out Ariel's.

18:07.431 --> 18:08.535
She's a great chef.

18:08.639 --> 18:10.606
But I think I'm the bestchef in this competition.

18:10.710 --> 18:11.538
Love it.

18:11.642 --> 18:12.815
Ariel, what are you doing?

18:12.919 --> 18:16.543
I am very much in thisMexican mode with a little bit

18:16.647 --> 18:18.476
of Asian influence right now.

18:18.580 --> 18:21.859
So my chicken is also kind
of an a la Brasa style.

18:21.962 --> 18:23.240
But it's going to
be a whole half

18:23.343 --> 18:26.864
bird that's brined and
marinated in a achiote

18:26.967 --> 18:28.762
and guajillo marinade.

18:28.866 --> 18:31.179
I feel like it's going tobe that much more challenging

18:31.282 --> 18:32.939
to succeed and to beat her.

18:33.042 --> 18:35.907
You know, I really
have to nail it now.

18:36.011 --> 18:39.773
The menu sounds great, andpersonal, which is really good.

18:39.877 --> 18:40.981
Here's some really
exciting news.

18:41.085 --> 18:43.156
After lunch, I've
arranged for one

18:43.260 --> 18:45.434
of the most
sought-after theme parks

18:45.538 --> 18:49.093
anywhere in the
country to be closed.

18:49.197 --> 18:50.163
That's right.

18:50.267 --> 18:52.614
You're both going to
spend the afternoon

18:52.717 --> 18:55.203
at Six Flags Magic Mountain.

18:55.306 --> 18:56.928
They have closed the park down.

18:57.032 --> 18:58.827
So forget the long lines.

18:58.930 --> 19:03.280
Not only are you VIPs, youhave the park to yourselves.

19:03.383 --> 19:04.626
This is, like, insane.

19:04.729 --> 19:06.041
I love roller coasters.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.284
I love amusement parks.

19:07.387 --> 19:08.733
This is going to be so much fun.

19:08.837 --> 19:12.220
And just to make thisafternoon even more special,

19:12.323 --> 19:16.603
your families are on
their way there now.

19:16.707 --> 19:18.329
This is like a
dream come true.

19:18.433 --> 19:20.297
It is unbelievable.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.988
Listen, from the
bottom of my heart,

19:22.091 --> 19:24.508
both you have individual
talents beyond belief.

19:24.611 --> 19:27.752
So I really want to wishyou both the best of luck.

19:27.856 --> 19:28.995
- Thank you.
- Bye, darling.

19:29.098 --> 19:29.927
Goodbye, Chef.

19:30.030 --> 19:31.377
Take care.
Enjoy the rest of that.

19:31.480 --> 19:32.550
Say hi to Mom and Dad.
Well done.

19:32.654 --> 19:33.724
Thank you.

19:33.827 --> 19:36.623
[inaudible] Enjoy the
rest of your day, OK.

19:36.727 --> 19:39.557
Enjoy lunch, but don't
be sick on those rides.

19:39.661 --> 19:40.834
Take care.

19:40.938 --> 19:41.732
Cheers.

19:41.835 --> 19:43.078
Good luck.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.459
You deserve it.
- Thank you.

19:44.562 --> 19:45.667
So do you.

19:45.770 --> 19:46.840
I'm happy you're my opponent.

19:46.944 --> 19:48.083
Yeah.
This is going to be fun.

19:48.187 --> 19:48.980
Uh-huh.

19:57.541 --> 19:58.473
Surprise.

19:58.576 --> 19:59.405
Hi.

19:59.508 --> 20:00.302
Hello.

20:00.406 --> 20:02.028
Hello again.

20:02.131 --> 20:04.064
Welcome to Six
Flags Magic Mountain.

20:04.168 --> 20:05.963
Chef Ramsay basically
has opened up

20:06.066 --> 20:07.206
the park for you guys tonight.

20:07.309 --> 20:08.483
Very cool.

20:08.586 --> 20:11.417
And we have 19 rollercoasters, the most of any theme

20:11.520 --> 20:12.556
park on the planet.

20:12.659 --> 20:14.765
And we're going to
start off at Viper.

20:14.868 --> 20:17.595
I've never had anyone shutdown an amusement park for me

20:17.699 --> 20:18.527
before.

20:18.631 --> 20:20.840
So this is total baller status.

20:20.943 --> 20:21.737
[inaudible], yay.

20:24.499 --> 20:26.225
I love roller coasters.

20:29.573 --> 20:32.058
And my family does too.

20:32.161 --> 20:35.510
[screams]

20:50.041 --> 20:51.836
It's so much fun.

20:51.940 --> 21:05.402
[screams]

21:05.505 --> 21:08.128
I can't thank you guys enoughfor being here tonight, so--

21:08.232 --> 21:09.129
We're happy to be here.

21:09.233 --> 21:10.234
Thank you.

21:10.338 --> 21:12.063
It feels good to be
out of Hell's Kitchen

21:12.167 --> 21:14.065
and with my parents
and just sort

21:14.169 --> 21:16.792
of enjoying the calmbefore the storm tomorrow.

21:16.896 --> 21:19.450
This is the perfect way
to relax before then.

21:19.554 --> 21:20.658
And here we are.

21:20.762 --> 21:21.590
Hello.

21:21.694 --> 21:23.903
Oh my, god, Chef.

21:24.006 --> 21:25.491
Hi.

21:25.594 --> 21:26.388
Come over.

21:26.492 --> 21:27.700
This is my daughter Holly.

21:27.803 --> 21:29.909
Now, when she found outthere's a roller coaster park,

21:30.012 --> 21:31.980
she did not want to miss out.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.568
It's a family
affair right now.

21:33.671 --> 21:36.156
And we're with Chef Ramsay.

21:36.260 --> 21:39.988
There is one
exciting ride left.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.611
We are going to experience FullThrottle for the first time--

21:42.715 --> 21:43.681
Wow.

21:43.785 --> 21:45.752
--before it goes
open to the public.

21:45.856 --> 21:47.478
Wait, has it
been tested, Chef?

21:47.582 --> 21:51.102
It's been tested, but none ofthe public have been on there.

21:51.206 --> 21:52.172
Let's go.

21:52.276 --> 21:55.348
This is a roller
coaster lover's dream.

21:55.452 --> 21:56.970
Now, I think the girls
should sit at the front.

21:57.074 --> 21:57.868
What do you think, Holls?

21:57.971 --> 21:59.870
Yes, I think so.

21:59.973 --> 22:00.974
And I'll sit at the back.

22:01.078 --> 22:01.872
Back door.

22:01.975 --> 22:02.907
Let's go.

22:03.011 --> 22:04.081
Full Throttle?

22:04.184 --> 22:05.358
Which way?
Full Throt--

22:05.462 --> 22:06.532
STAFF MEMBER: Up the stairs.- Right up the stairs.

22:06.635 --> 22:07.498
Ladies, let's go.

22:07.602 --> 22:08.637
Mom and Dad, let's go.
That's cool.

22:08.741 --> 22:09.535
Looks like a stage.

22:09.638 --> 22:10.432
Straight up the stairs.

22:10.536 --> 22:11.330
Turn left.

22:11.433 --> 22:12.227
Yeah?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.435
Yeah.

22:13.539 --> 22:15.092
What's up with all these lights?

22:15.195 --> 22:16.818
I can't see.

22:16.921 --> 22:17.784
Oh, my god.

22:17.888 --> 22:21.167
Look at that!

22:21.270 --> 22:22.548
NARRATOR: After
meeting up with his two

22:22.651 --> 22:26.275

22:30.176 --> 22:32.040

Full Throttle,
straight up the stairs.

22:33.490 --> 22:36.216
Turn left.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.839
What's up with
all these lights?

22:37.942 --> 22:38.874
Why are there people out here?

22:38.978 --> 22:39.875
[cheers]

22:39.979 --> 22:42.809
What is happening right now?

22:42.913 --> 22:44.811
Oh, my god.

22:44.915 --> 22:48.228
Look, there's Jocky
and Christina.

22:53.268 --> 22:56.582
Ladies and gentlemen, thankyou so much for being here.

22:56.685 --> 23:00.517
I'm so excited and
so proud to introduce

23:00.620 --> 23:04.659
you to our two "Hell's Kitchen"finalists, Ariel and Mia.

23:04.762 --> 23:07.903
[applause]

23:10.043 --> 23:12.770
This is their final challenge.

23:15.808 --> 23:18.638
Your 60 minutes starts now.

23:18.742 --> 23:20.295
Off you go.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.229
I cannot believe that wehave a challenge right now.

23:23.332 --> 23:24.126
Ready?

23:24.230 --> 23:25.196
Yeah.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.267
This just went from
a relaxing family

23:27.371 --> 23:33.550
time at an amusement park tothe ultimate final challenge.

23:33.653 --> 23:34.999
NARRATOR: For their
final challenge,

23:35.103 --> 23:37.346
Ariel and Mia have
just 60 minutes

23:37.450 --> 23:39.452
to cook five dishes
with the help

23:39.556 --> 23:41.005
of their sous chefs, Jocky--

23:41.109 --> 23:42.179
Start talking to me.

23:42.282 --> 23:45.182
So we can startmarinating the churrasco.

23:45.285 --> 23:46.321
NARRATOR: --and Christina.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.012
- I'm your sous chef today.
- Thank you.

23:48.116 --> 23:49.428
For one hour, I get to
tell you what to do?

23:49.531 --> 23:50.325
For one hour.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.706
That's exactly it.

23:51.809 --> 23:52.845
NARRATOR: They'll
need to make one

23:52.948 --> 23:55.054
cold and one hot appetizer--

23:55.157 --> 23:56.538
Start working on croquettes.

23:56.642 --> 23:57.608
Mole's started.

23:57.712 --> 23:59.058
I'm marinating the meat now.

23:59.161 --> 24:00.818
NARRATOR: --as well as
three different entrees,

24:00.922 --> 24:03.131
featuring seafood,
chicken, and steak.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.684
Chicken sauce next,
so we can just have

24:04.788 --> 24:06.306
it set aside and ready to go.

24:06.410 --> 24:07.273
You got it.

24:07.376 --> 24:09.102
Do we have a
seafood stock ready?

24:09.206 --> 24:10.069
Yes.

24:10.172 --> 24:11.898
Mix salad on top
of the avocado.

24:12.002 --> 24:14.004
[screams]

24:14.107 --> 24:14.936
Whoa!

24:15.039 --> 24:16.489
Scared the shit out of me.

24:16.593 --> 24:18.457
I was like, what?

24:18.560 --> 24:19.630
What is going on?

24:24.186 --> 24:28.294
I have a roller coaster overmy head, lights in my face,

24:28.397 --> 24:29.226
people cheering.

24:29.329 --> 24:31.193
And I'm cooking
up against Ariel.

24:31.297 --> 24:32.885
She's a fierce competitor.

24:32.988 --> 24:35.404
This is like the
cooking Olympics here.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.854
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Let's go, Ariel.

24:36.958 --> 24:37.752
Yeah.

24:41.238 --> 24:43.896
I'm doing everything in
my power to avoid making

24:43.999 --> 24:46.001
eye contact with my parents.

24:46.105 --> 24:49.695
I need to be like Ariel
goes into robot mode

24:49.798 --> 24:51.490
and totally has no emotion.

24:51.593 --> 24:53.526
Otherwise, I'm never going tomake it through this challenge.

24:53.630 --> 24:54.872
Are you watching those carrots?

24:54.976 --> 24:57.496
Yep.

24:57.599 --> 24:59.705
I want to show you
how to do the plantains.

24:59.808 --> 25:01.189
I may be the
rookie, but I'm just

25:01.292 --> 25:04.123
trying to stay
cool, calm, focused

25:04.226 --> 25:07.264
and just cook my heart
out, like I've been

25:07.367 --> 25:09.646
doing this whole competition.

25:09.749 --> 25:13.166
We need to work on chimichurri,with the piquillo chimichurri.

25:13.270 --> 25:14.685
- Halfway, guys, yes?
- Yes, Chef.

25:14.789 --> 25:15.583
Christina, you're good?

25:15.686 --> 25:17.136
Yes, Chef, halfway through.

25:17.239 --> 25:18.413
Yeah.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.761
And I spilled the salt.
I knocked the salt over.

25:21.865 --> 25:22.693
Awesome, buddy.

25:22.797 --> 25:23.556
Get it over your shoulder.

25:26.835 --> 25:27.629
This is croquette, yeah?

25:27.733 --> 25:28.734
Yes, croquette.

25:28.837 --> 25:30.908
The fat and the bits
inside the croquettes.

25:31.012 --> 25:33.083
I'm just focused right
now with Chef Jocky.

25:33.186 --> 25:34.602
I'm the one that's in charge.

25:34.705 --> 25:37.259
I'm the one that's showinghim how to do things.

25:37.363 --> 25:39.538
More salt, more
pork, more plantain.

25:39.641 --> 25:42.368
I know what tastes
good, what doesn't.

25:42.471 --> 25:45.060
I've created a bad-ass menu.

25:45.164 --> 25:47.028
And it gives me a
boost of confidence.

25:47.131 --> 25:48.167
Flash these in the oven.

25:48.270 --> 25:51.826
Just a little bit of
lemon juice and salt.

25:51.929 --> 25:52.896
Gold.

25:52.999 --> 25:55.312
My mackerel's on
the grill skin side.

25:55.415 --> 25:56.693
Chef Christina has
made it very clear

25:56.796 --> 25:59.109
that she's had someconcerns or reservations.

25:59.212 --> 26:02.457
But I'm going to stick to mygut, and I'm using mackerel.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.700
I know it was a risk.

26:03.803 --> 26:05.425
But I just thought itwould come together nicely.

26:05.529 --> 26:06.323
Five minutes, ladies.

26:06.426 --> 26:07.635
Let's go, please.

26:07.738 --> 26:09.084
Go, Mia.

26:09.188 --> 26:11.570
I love you.

26:11.673 --> 26:17.023
Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia,
Mia, Mia, Mia--

26:17.127 --> 26:20.268
To me, the most nerve-rackingpart is having my parents here,

26:20.371 --> 26:23.651
because my whole menu
is based on digging

26:23.754 --> 26:25.342
into my Puerto Rican roots.

26:25.445 --> 26:26.999
And it really comes
from the heart.

26:27.102 --> 26:30.002
And I just want to
make my family proud.

26:30.105 --> 26:32.798
We need the mis for the
tiradito on this side.

26:32.901 --> 26:33.730
The mis for what?

26:33.833 --> 26:35.697
The mis for the hamachi.

26:35.801 --> 26:37.009
90 seconds, ladies
and gentlemen.

26:37.112 --> 26:38.769
Let's go.

26:38.873 --> 26:39.701
Ay.

26:39.805 --> 26:40.702
[spanish]

26:40.806 --> 26:42.186
This is the rib
cap plate right here.

26:45.051 --> 26:54.060
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

26:54.164 --> 26:56.442
Well done.

26:56.545 --> 26:58.824
Let's go.

26:58.927 --> 27:01.689
This is crazy.

27:01.792 --> 27:02.586
Time is up.

27:02.690 --> 27:03.483
Pencils down.

27:03.587 --> 27:04.968
And I'm happy with everything.

27:05.071 --> 27:09.386
I need to trust that I've stayedtrue to myself and my flavors.

27:09.489 --> 27:13.252
Now it's just up to the judges.

27:13.355 --> 27:15.081
Let's hear it for
our "Hell's Kitchen"

27:15.185 --> 27:16.117
finalists, ladies and gentlemen.

27:16.220 --> 27:17.083
Let's go.

27:17.187 --> 27:18.050
Great job up there.

27:18.153 --> 27:19.016
Thank you, Chef.

27:19.120 --> 27:19.983
Good job.

27:20.086 --> 27:20.949
Well done.

27:23.987 --> 27:26.575
Now, Mia, on a scale of 1to 10, how confident are you?

27:26.679 --> 27:27.853
- 11.
- 11.

27:27.956 --> 27:29.026
Love it.

27:29.130 --> 27:29.958
Right.

27:30.062 --> 27:32.409
Go, Mia, go!

27:32.512 --> 27:33.824
Ariel, are you happy
with your dishes?

27:33.928 --> 27:34.894
Yes, Chef.

27:34.998 --> 27:36.378
On a scale of 10, how
confident are you?

27:36.482 --> 27:37.517
Well, I have to
say 12 now, Mia.

27:37.621 --> 27:38.415
12.

27:38.518 --> 27:39.450
Love it.

27:39.554 --> 27:41.867
I told you the ladies
are competitive.

27:41.970 --> 27:43.109
Right.

27:43.213 --> 27:44.870
Your dishes will be judgedon a scale of 1 to 10

27:44.973 --> 27:47.389
by some of the best chefsanywhere in the country.

27:47.493 --> 27:49.702
The chef with the most pointswins your final big challenge.

27:49.806 --> 27:50.979
Are we ready?
- Yes, Chef.

27:51.083 --> 27:51.911
Great.

27:52.015 --> 27:53.499
I'm totally nervous.

27:53.602 --> 27:55.639
I've got my stomach in knots.

27:55.743 --> 27:57.365
Cold apps, let's go.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.885
And not knowing who theguest judges are going to be,

27:59.988 --> 28:01.507
it's driving me crazy.

28:01.610 --> 28:04.579
Our first judge thisevening, she is the co-owner

28:04.683 --> 28:08.100
and legendary chef of the
incredible Border Grill,

28:08.203 --> 28:10.171
Mary Sue Milliken,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:10.274 --> 28:11.482
Amazing.

28:11.586 --> 28:12.932
Hi.
Hi.

28:13.036 --> 28:14.106
Thank you, Chef.
- Good to see you.

28:14.209 --> 28:15.003
Welcome.

28:15.107 --> 28:16.004
Thank you.

28:16.108 --> 28:16.902
Oh, my gosh.

28:17.005 --> 28:18.179
The chef from Border Grill.

28:18.282 --> 28:21.700
She is famous for Latincuisine, and that's what I do.

28:21.803 --> 28:25.082
So could it get any more
nerve-racking than this?

28:25.186 --> 28:26.877
Ladies, let's start
off with Mia first.

28:26.981 --> 28:30.432
So this is a hamachitiradito, the Peruvian version

28:30.536 --> 28:31.917
of a sashimi.

28:32.020 --> 28:33.953
It has a little bit
of black truffle

28:34.057 --> 28:35.265
and then fresh sturgeon caviar.

28:35.368 --> 28:36.611
- Mmm.
- Wow.

28:36.715 --> 28:37.577
How was that, darling?

28:37.681 --> 28:40.235
It's delicious, definitely.

28:40.339 --> 28:43.722
Really delicious.

28:43.825 --> 28:46.172
I don't know if I wouldhave put the truffles in.

28:46.276 --> 28:48.105
But it's really
playful and beautiful.

28:48.209 --> 28:49.555
And that's what I love
in a first course.

28:49.658 --> 28:50.452
Lovely.

28:50.556 --> 28:51.833
Excellent.

28:51.937 --> 28:53.179
Amazing feedback.

28:53.283 --> 28:56.873
All right, Ariel, pleasedescribe your cold appetizer.

28:56.976 --> 29:00.566
Ariel's dish looks
kind of similar to mine.

29:00.669 --> 29:02.533
But mine looks better.

29:02.637 --> 29:03.880
It's a shrimp ceviche rojo.

29:03.983 --> 29:06.606
There's a little bit ofavocado espuma at the bottom.

29:06.710 --> 29:09.264
And then some plantain chips
to enjoy it with, Chef.

29:09.368 --> 29:10.438
Amazing.

29:10.541 --> 29:11.715
Visually, Mary
Sue, how does that?

29:11.819 --> 29:13.648
Well, it's also very pretty.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.306
The creaminess of the
avocado is lovely.

29:16.409 --> 29:17.652
The shrimp tastes great.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.137
I didn't quite get that
espuma at the bottom.

29:20.241 --> 29:23.106
But very nice.

29:23.209 --> 29:24.107
All right.

29:24.210 --> 29:25.936
For Mia's cold
appetizer, hamachi,

29:26.040 --> 29:27.869
where are we going on ascale of 1 to 10, please?

29:27.973 --> 29:29.181
I would go with a 9.

29:29.284 --> 29:30.044
A 9.

29:30.147 --> 29:31.148
Wow.

29:31.252 --> 29:32.943
That's a strong start.

29:33.047 --> 29:35.981
That is a very,
very strong start.

29:36.084 --> 29:38.328
And for Ariel's cold appetizer?

29:38.431 --> 29:39.225
Um.

29:47.268 --> 29:48.510
NARRATOR: The final
challenge takes

29:48.614 --> 29:50.305
place at one of
the premier roller

29:50.409 --> 29:51.824
coaster parks in the world.

29:51.928 --> 29:54.275
And Chef Mary Sue
Milliken has scored

29:54.378 --> 29:58.313
rookie finalist Mia's firstdish, cold hamachi appetizer.

29:58.417 --> 29:59.556
I would go with a 9.

29:59.659 --> 30:00.453
CHEF RAMSAY: A 9.

30:00.557 --> 30:01.834
Wow.

30:01.938 --> 30:03.353
That's a strong start.

30:03.456 --> 30:06.080
And for Ariel's shrimp dish?

30:06.183 --> 30:07.495
Which I also really loved.

30:12.741 --> 30:14.778
I think I would go with an 8.

30:14.882 --> 30:16.262
Very, very strong also.

30:16.366 --> 30:17.850
CHEF RAMSAY: It's a
very, very good start.

30:17.954 --> 30:19.679
Mia is definitely
gunning for this,

30:19.783 --> 30:20.888
playing hardball right now.

30:20.991 --> 30:21.992
- Thank you so much.- Good luck with everything.

30:22.096 --> 30:22.890
Thank you.

30:22.993 --> 30:24.098
She nails these challenges.

30:24.201 --> 30:25.168
That's what she does.

30:25.271 --> 30:26.134
What a start.

30:26.238 --> 30:28.792
Now, judging the
hot appetizer round,

30:28.896 --> 30:32.209
he has two critically acclaimedrestaurants in Las Vegas,

30:32.313 --> 30:34.763
RM Seafood and RM Boiler Room.

30:34.867 --> 30:38.733
Rick Moonen, ladies
and gentlemen.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.252
Oh, my god.

30:40.355 --> 30:42.288
I'm a really big
fan of Chef Moonen.

30:42.392 --> 30:44.912
I would go to his restaurantswhen I lived in Vegas.

30:45.015 --> 30:46.361
And I've never met him.

30:46.465 --> 30:48.329
So I'm just so excited.

30:48.432 --> 30:49.261
Right.

30:49.364 --> 30:50.710
Let's start off with Ariel.

30:50.814 --> 30:53.161
So what I did here
was Wagyu tataki.

30:53.265 --> 30:56.061
Topped it with a spicy aioli,red onion, garlic chips,

30:56.164 --> 30:59.064
and some micro herbs.

30:59.167 --> 31:00.237
That's a party in your mouth.

31:00.341 --> 31:01.929
This is well seasoned.

31:02.032 --> 31:03.171
Delicious.

31:03.275 --> 31:04.138
Great start.

31:04.241 --> 31:05.311
Mia, please explain
to Chef Moonen.

31:05.415 --> 31:06.761
I'm from Puerto Rico.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.901
And I'm not sure if you'refamiliar with mofongo.

31:09.005 --> 31:10.696
It's a very traditional dish.

31:10.799 --> 31:12.801
And I've been dying
to bust it out.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.113
As long as it's got flavor.

31:14.217 --> 31:17.530
Inside, they have plantain,a little bit of pork fat--

31:17.634 --> 31:19.360
we call it [spanish].

31:19.463 --> 31:20.292
This is comfort food.

31:20.395 --> 31:21.293
CHEF RAMSAY: Yeah.

31:21.396 --> 31:23.329
This is more
comforting to the heart.

31:23.433 --> 31:25.021
It's got good textures.

31:25.124 --> 31:27.195
Maybe a little more seasoningin the center, I think.

31:27.299 --> 31:28.300
Two good dishes.

31:28.403 --> 31:29.922
On a scale of 1 to 10,
where are we going?

31:30.026 --> 31:32.925
Mia, I would
rate your dish a 8.

31:33.029 --> 31:34.064
8.

31:34.168 --> 31:36.101
Thank you, Chef.

31:36.204 --> 31:40.105
Ariel, I would give you a 9.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.002
CHEF RAMSAY: A 9, wow.

31:41.106 --> 31:42.107
Thank you, Chef.

31:42.210 --> 31:43.763
Good dish.

31:43.867 --> 31:45.420
I look forward to
seeing you in Vegas.

31:45.524 --> 31:46.697
Great job.

31:46.801 --> 31:49.700
My croquettes were
done on the fly.

31:49.804 --> 31:51.979
But I know how I'm
going to fix this.

31:52.082 --> 31:54.222
CHEF RAMSAY: We are all
tied up at 17 apiece.

31:54.326 --> 31:55.672
And overall, he liked it.

31:55.775 --> 31:56.569
So I'm happy.

31:56.673 --> 31:57.467
And we're still tied.

31:58.744 --> 32:00.021
NARRATOR: Next up
is Michelin star

32:00.125 --> 32:03.887
owner of the acclaimed Melisserestaurant, Chef Josiah Citrin.

32:03.991 --> 32:04.853
Good to see you.

32:04.957 --> 32:06.269
How're you doing?

32:06.372 --> 32:09.065
NARRATOR: The first dish he willjudge is Mia's seafood entree.

32:09.168 --> 32:11.446
It's called [spanish].

32:11.550 --> 32:14.518
It has cuttlefish, shrimp,some prawns as well,

32:14.622 --> 32:15.899
and just clean flavors.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.214
I like the presentation.

32:20.317 --> 32:22.043
I like the texture, theway it's crunchy at first.

32:22.147 --> 32:24.218
This has that craveability,like you want eat it again.

32:24.321 --> 32:25.288
CHEF RAMSAY: Inspiring.
- Very well done.

32:25.391 --> 32:28.429
CHEF RAMSAY: Great
start for the seafood.

32:28.532 --> 32:31.190
NARRATOR: Next to be judged isAriel's Spanish mackerel Vera

32:31.294 --> 32:32.536
Cruz.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.229
The sauce is a traditionalVera Cruz with some mirin

32:35.332 --> 32:36.920
and saki in there.

32:37.024 --> 32:38.335
Choosing mackerel,
I mean, that's risky.

32:38.439 --> 32:39.474
Because a lot of
people, you know.

32:42.201 --> 32:44.031
But I love mackerel.

32:44.134 --> 32:45.204
And I think it's very party.

32:45.308 --> 32:46.274
The flavor was great.

32:46.378 --> 32:47.206
Beautiful.

32:47.310 --> 32:48.345
Excellent.

32:48.449 --> 32:50.313
Let's go with Mia first,
on a scale of 1 to 10.

32:50.416 --> 32:51.521
I'll give that an 8.

32:51.624 --> 32:52.453
An 8?

32:52.556 --> 32:54.869
And Ariel's mackerel dish, Chef?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.043
I would like to give it a 9.

32:56.146 --> 32:56.940
NARRATOR: A 9?

32:57.044 --> 32:58.252
Thank you, Chef.

32:58.355 --> 33:01.531
Usually I have the
leg up on everybody,

33:01.634 --> 33:02.877
but now it's just Ariel.

33:02.981 --> 33:03.774
And she's tough.

33:03.878 --> 33:04.672
Good luck.

33:04.775 --> 33:05.914
Thank you so much.

33:06.018 --> 33:09.297
I really need to kill
it with this next dish.

33:09.401 --> 33:11.610
Judging our chicken
dish is an award-winning

33:11.713 --> 33:16.028
chef whose popular restaurantsinclude Burger Bar and Fleur.

33:16.132 --> 33:18.479
Please welcome Hubert Keller.

33:18.582 --> 33:19.376
Chef.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.308
Oh, my god.

33:20.412 --> 33:22.138
Yeah, this is insane.

33:22.241 --> 33:25.141
Chef Keller is a
renowned restaurateur.

33:25.244 --> 33:27.212
And he's the best
French chef out there.

33:27.315 --> 33:29.179
I mean, this is amazing.

33:29.283 --> 33:30.215
Chef, great to have you back.

33:30.318 --> 33:31.112
Right.

33:31.216 --> 33:32.079
Let's start off with Ariel.

33:32.182 --> 33:33.045
OK.

33:33.149 --> 33:34.874
I have here roasted
chicken breast.

33:34.978 --> 33:36.531
The star of that is the sauce.

33:36.635 --> 33:39.258
It's made with slow-cookedroasted chicken skin blended

33:39.362 --> 33:40.190
into the chicken jus.

33:40.294 --> 33:41.743
So it'll be nice
and rich for you.

33:41.847 --> 33:42.641
It's a good dish.

33:42.744 --> 33:44.574
The sauce really goes beautiful.

33:44.677 --> 33:46.403
Us French, how spicy
it gets is usually

33:46.507 --> 33:48.957
the black pepper, right, becauseI'm not used to the spice.

33:49.061 --> 33:51.201
But I think the level
of spiciness right here,

33:51.305 --> 33:52.375
it's just perfect.

33:52.478 --> 33:53.548
Thank you, Chef.

33:53.652 --> 33:57.311
Yes, this is awesome.

33:57.414 --> 33:59.382
Mia, please describe
your dish to Chef.

33:59.485 --> 34:02.868
So, Chef, this is a Peruvianpollo a la Brasa, which

34:02.971 --> 34:06.389
is traditional roasted chicken,marinated in soy sauce,

34:06.492 --> 34:07.804
cumen, paprika.

34:07.907 --> 34:09.081
I live in South Beach.

34:09.185 --> 34:12.533
And I kind of wanted tobring the bold, fun flavors.

34:12.636 --> 34:13.706
OK.

34:13.810 --> 34:16.951
Us French, usually, I'm
not used to the spice.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.332
But I think it's
a beautiful dish.

34:18.435 --> 34:19.540
I think it has flavors.

34:19.643 --> 34:20.472
It's fresh.

34:20.575 --> 34:22.543
The chicken perfectly cooked.

34:22.646 --> 34:24.993
So I think we have
quite a challenge

34:25.097 --> 34:27.134
between both dishes here.

34:27.237 --> 34:29.274
Ariel's chicken
dish looks good.

34:29.377 --> 34:32.104
And we both have
very similar dishes.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.762
But I know mine tastes better.

34:34.865 --> 34:35.901
Let's go with Mia first.

34:36.004 --> 34:38.317
On a scale of 1 to 10,
where are we going?

34:38.421 --> 34:40.837
I would say a 9.

34:40.940 --> 34:41.838
CHEF RAMSAY: A 9?

34:43.011 --> 34:44.392
Wow.

34:44.496 --> 34:46.360
And then Ariel's chicken breast?

34:46.463 --> 34:48.810
I would say an 8.

34:48.914 --> 34:49.742
Thank you, Chef.

34:49.846 --> 34:51.399
CHEF RAMSAY: We have a tie.

34:51.503 --> 34:52.676
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:52.780 --> 34:53.574
Merci beaucoup.

34:53.677 --> 34:55.541
Thank you.

34:55.645 --> 34:58.303
Ladies and gentlemen, judgingour final course tonight,

34:58.406 --> 35:01.029
this chef is the recipientof two Michelin stars.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.755
He owns one of the best
restaurants anywhere

35:02.859 --> 35:04.205
in the country, Providence.

35:04.309 --> 35:06.794
Please give a warm welcomefor Michael Cimarusti,

35:06.897 --> 35:07.691
ladies and gentlemen.

35:07.795 --> 35:08.589
Thank you.

35:11.316 --> 35:13.387
We're tied, and
my nerves are shot.

35:13.490 --> 35:15.458
We don't know who's going tocome out of this the winner.

35:15.561 --> 35:19.496
So I just have to take
a breath and let it go.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.877
Chef, we've got good
news and bad news.

35:20.980 --> 35:22.016
I'll start with
the bad news first.

35:22.120 --> 35:22.913
All right.

35:23.017 --> 35:24.052
Two exceptional ladies.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.468
They are tied right now.

35:25.571 --> 35:26.607
Great.

35:26.710 --> 35:27.435
CHEF RAMSAY: You're
going to be breaking it.

35:27.539 --> 35:28.712
I am?

35:28.816 --> 35:29.679
I thought that was your job.

35:29.782 --> 35:30.645
No.

35:30.749 --> 35:31.750
The good news is
you're going to be

35:31.853 --> 35:34.132
tasting two incredible dishes.

35:34.235 --> 35:36.134
So right now it's 0-0is what you're telling me.

35:36.237 --> 35:37.031
It doesn't matter.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.205
It's nil-nil, right?

35:38.308 --> 35:39.896
CHEF RAMSAY: Exactly that.

35:39.999 --> 35:40.793
Ariel, please.

35:40.897 --> 35:41.725
OK.

35:41.829 --> 35:43.658
We have a mole-rubbed rib cap.

35:43.762 --> 35:46.592
That's a mole red wine
demi and some roasted

35:46.696 --> 35:49.216
carrots with a little
bit of fresh watercress.

35:49.319 --> 35:51.079
That's-- this is
actually a pretty

35:51.183 --> 35:54.945
tricky piece of beef to cook.

35:55.049 --> 35:57.465
But this is, like,cooked perfectly, tender.

35:57.569 --> 35:58.570
It's seasoned well.

35:58.673 --> 35:59.950
The mole sauce is delicious.I don't know.

36:00.054 --> 36:01.642
Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

36:01.745 --> 36:02.539
Yeah.

36:04.541 --> 36:06.025
Mia, please describe
your dish to Chef.

36:06.129 --> 36:07.441
Thank you.

36:07.544 --> 36:10.202
So Chef, when I think of meat,it transports me back to home

36:10.306 --> 36:12.929
and my dad on the grill.

36:13.032 --> 36:14.965
I have tostones,
which is how Puerto

36:15.069 --> 36:16.760
Ricans cook their plantains.

36:16.864 --> 36:18.728
On top of the meat,
a little herb salad.

36:18.831 --> 36:20.971
And then roasted tomato
and garlic aioli.

36:21.075 --> 36:23.629
How's it taste, Chef?

36:23.733 --> 36:24.561
I don't know.

36:24.665 --> 36:25.528
I'm almost speechless here.

36:28.289 --> 36:29.083
It's really good.

36:32.328 --> 36:35.227
Chef, the name that youwill say will break the tie

36:35.331 --> 36:36.642
and win the challenge.

36:36.746 --> 36:39.127
What comes through
in both of these dishes

36:39.231 --> 36:41.475
is a little bit of heartand a little bit of heritage

36:41.578 --> 36:42.786
and a little bit of home.

36:42.890 --> 36:44.478
And, you know, you're
cooking in a kitchen

36:44.581 --> 36:47.343
outside in front of a rollercoaster in a theme park.

36:47.446 --> 36:50.173
I mean, like, the food
should not be this good.

36:50.277 --> 36:51.623
Thank you.

36:51.726 --> 36:52.831
Great comments.

36:52.934 --> 36:56.006
Chef, is it Mia, or is it Ariel?

36:56.110 --> 36:57.698
I need a winner.

36:57.801 --> 36:58.595
Uh, it's--

37:04.325 --> 37:06.914
NARRATOR: It's the last roundof the final challenge--

37:07.017 --> 37:08.674
CHEF RAMSAY: Chef, as
you know, we're tied.

37:08.778 --> 37:11.298
NARRATOR: --and acclaimedchef Michael Cimarusti

37:11.401 --> 37:13.507
must decide between
veteran Ariel

37:13.610 --> 37:16.475
and rookie Mia's steakdishes to determine a winner.

37:16.579 --> 37:18.443
I need a winner.

37:18.546 --> 37:23.206
It's-- Mia, I've
got to give it to you.

37:23.310 --> 37:25.553
The food was just
absolutely delicious.

37:25.657 --> 37:26.554
Congratulations.

37:26.658 --> 37:27.452
Thank you.

37:31.973 --> 37:35.460
Chef Michael
Cimarusti, thank you.

37:35.563 --> 37:39.084
This is proof that I have whatit takes going into tomorrow

37:39.187 --> 37:39.981
night's dinner service.

37:40.085 --> 37:42.363
Like, I know this
menu's a winner.

37:42.467 --> 37:45.401
Narrowly behind, please
give it up for Ariel.

37:45.504 --> 37:46.402
Great job.

37:46.505 --> 37:47.748
Thank you.

37:47.851 --> 37:49.336
I don't think there'sanything to be ashamed of.

37:49.439 --> 37:50.440
Good job.

37:50.544 --> 37:52.925
This competition's
about running a service.

37:53.029 --> 37:55.273
This is where the
real challenge comes.

37:55.376 --> 37:57.240
It's game time tomorrow.

37:57.344 --> 37:59.794
Ladies, welcome back
the returning chefs.

37:59.898 --> 38:01.382
Here we go.

38:01.486 --> 38:10.184
Roe, Scotley, Jose, Trevor,Kanae, Heather, Motto,

38:10.288 --> 38:13.567
and Bret, our returning chefs.

38:13.670 --> 38:15.327
Thank you so much
for being here.

38:15.431 --> 38:16.466
Welcome back.

38:16.570 --> 38:17.467
OK, Mia.

38:17.571 --> 38:19.366
As the winner of
your final challenge,

38:19.469 --> 38:22.196
you now have a big
advantage, because you

38:22.300 --> 38:24.612
have the first choice
for your brigade.

38:24.716 --> 38:26.580
OK.

38:26.683 --> 38:32.310
This person is extremely
organized, efficient.

38:32.413 --> 38:35.002
I do not want Mia
to pick me whatsoever.

38:35.105 --> 38:37.453
I do not want to be on her team.

38:37.556 --> 38:38.833
Roe.
CHEF RAMSAY: Roe.

38:38.937 --> 38:39.593
Welcome.
Wow.

38:44.045 --> 38:45.702
Congratulations.

38:45.806 --> 38:47.221
I think Ariel is a strong chef.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.119
But I think Mia
has been surprising

38:49.223 --> 38:50.397
all of us this whole season.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.226
And I'm happy to work for her.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.814
She's obviously
got what it takes.

38:53.917 --> 38:55.229
Right, Ariel.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.714
This person has one of
the biggest, brightest

38:57.818 --> 39:01.166
personalities I've
ever met in my career

39:01.269 --> 39:04.652
and has a hustle and a littlespirit like a firecracker.

39:04.756 --> 39:05.584
Good.

39:05.688 --> 39:07.621
So I need that hustle with me.

39:07.724 --> 39:09.416
I'm going to pick
Kanae as my first pick.

39:09.519 --> 39:10.382
CHEF RAMSAY: Kanae.

39:10.486 --> 39:11.314
Wow.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.661
You know I've got you.

39:16.181 --> 39:17.009
CHEF RAMSAY: All right, Mia.

39:17.113 --> 39:17.976
Second pick.

39:18.079 --> 39:20.081
This person is
a critical thinker

39:20.185 --> 39:21.842
and has attention to detail.

39:21.945 --> 39:22.774
Trev.

39:22.877 --> 39:25.017
CHEF RAMSAY: Trev.

39:25.121 --> 39:26.398
Mia, uh uh uh.

39:26.502 --> 39:28.814
You really made the wrongchoice picking Trevor.

39:28.918 --> 39:30.678
Good choice.

39:30.782 --> 39:32.266
OK, Ariel.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.716
Bret, get your ass up here.

39:33.819 --> 39:35.407
CHEF RAMSAY: Bret, right.

39:35.511 --> 39:36.304
Wow.

39:36.408 --> 39:37.754
You know it, girl.

39:37.858 --> 39:38.962
Wise choice, Ariel.

39:39.066 --> 39:43.829
You've got a murder goon
squad behind you 100%.

39:43.933 --> 39:44.830
CHEF RAMSAY: Now, Mia.

39:44.934 --> 39:45.866
Jose.

39:45.969 --> 39:48.282
CHEF RAMSAY: Jose, wow.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.179
Ariel?

39:49.283 --> 39:50.249
Motto, please come up here.

39:50.353 --> 39:51.561
CHEF RAMSAY: Wow.

39:51.665 --> 39:52.493
OK.

39:52.597 --> 39:53.598
Last time to shine here.

39:53.701 --> 39:55.841
So I'm going to enjoy
every second of it.

39:55.945 --> 39:58.223
Ladies and gentlemen, that isa chef's chef, let me tell you.

39:58.326 --> 39:59.258
Right.
And Mia, here we go.

39:59.362 --> 40:00.294
Down to the wire.
Two choices.

40:03.746 --> 40:04.540
Heather.

40:04.643 --> 40:06.058
CHEF RAMSAY: Heather, let's go.

40:06.162 --> 40:07.577
We'll save the best for last.

40:10.856 --> 40:14.308
And I'm Team Mia.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.690
Uh, OK.

40:16.793 --> 40:18.277
CHEF RAMSAY: AndScotley, come on up, bud.

40:18.381 --> 40:19.175
Let's go.

40:19.278 --> 40:22.143
Round of applause for Scotley.

40:22.247 --> 40:23.593
We never cooked
together, but we're

40:23.697 --> 40:25.146
going to cook together now.- I know, that's OK.

40:25.250 --> 40:26.216
I'm going to show you.

40:26.320 --> 40:29.599
Tomorrow the two
of you will face off

40:29.703 --> 40:31.739
in the most important
dinner service

40:31.843 --> 40:34.052
of your entire culinary lives.

40:34.155 --> 40:35.950
All season long,
Mia has definitely

40:36.054 --> 40:37.642
been the toughest competitor.

40:37.745 --> 40:41.369
But at the end of the day, Ifeel like I've earned this.

40:41.473 --> 40:44.062
And I'm the right person
to win this competition.

40:44.165 --> 40:46.789
One of you will become
the executive chef

40:46.892 --> 40:49.412
at the first-ever flagshipHell's Kitchen restaurant

40:49.516 --> 40:55.487
at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas,with a salary of a quarter

40:55.591 --> 40:56.454
of a million dollars.

40:56.557 --> 40:58.870
There's a lot at stake.

40:58.973 --> 40:59.974
I'm in it to win it.

41:00.078 --> 41:02.252
And I just have to be
ready for anything.

41:02.356 --> 41:06.256
I haven't doubted myself,not one step of the way.

41:06.360 --> 41:08.811
I started off as a
rookie, but I really

41:08.914 --> 41:10.606
don't see myself like one.

41:10.709 --> 41:12.677
Before you head back
to Hell's Kitchen,

41:12.780 --> 41:16.059
I want you to bond with
your talented brigades.

41:16.163 --> 41:23.515
I mean, the whole team isriding the Full Throttle.

41:23.619 --> 41:25.448
Uh.

41:25.552 --> 41:27.139
You've got to be kidding me.

41:27.243 --> 41:29.763
My face is about to be so ugly.

41:29.866 --> 41:33.214
[screams]

41:47.228 --> 41:50.611
NARRATOR: Next time

42:20.952 --> 42:22.885

42:29.477 --> 42:30.340
I need that chicken.
