WEBVTT

00:02.609 --> 00:04.542
Oh, the... there's
a 7:15 at the ArcLight.

00:04.962 --> 00:06.506
Well, that doesn't give
us much time to eat.

00:06.530 --> 00:07.696
We can eat afterwards.

00:07.765 --> 00:09.632
I'm not gonna eat
at 10:00 at night.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.000
Who am I, Hemingway?

00:12.603 --> 00:14.770
Why do you think
Hemingway ate at 10:00?

00:14.839 --> 00:17.006
He spent a lot of time in
Spain. They eat dinner late.

00:17.074 --> 00:18.841
He also spent
a lot of time in Florida.

00:18.909 --> 00:20.454
Last time I was there,
people were eating dinner

00:20.478 --> 00:22.344
at, like, 4:30.

00:22.413 --> 00:23.679
You guys know

00:23.748 --> 00:26.448
that Hemingway had
cats with six toes?

00:27.585 --> 00:30.686
Six toes per foot
or six toes total?

00:30.755 --> 00:32.154
Okay.

00:32.223 --> 00:34.303
It's official. We're never
going to see the <i>Avengers.</i>

00:34.959 --> 00:36.892
Guys, just come on.
Make a decision.

00:36.961 --> 00:38.494
I-I'm good with
eating after.

00:38.562 --> 00:41.063
- Mm, I'm kind of hungry now.
- Yeah, me, too.

00:41.132 --> 00:42.576
- Then we'll eat before.
- Okay.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.534
So, then, we can see the 3-D
at 9:00 or the 2-D at 9:30.

00:45.603 --> 00:47.202
3-D.
If I'm gonna see Thor,

00:47.271 --> 00:49.872
I want to feel like
I could lick those abs.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.342
Actually,
3-D kind of makes me queasy.

00:53.411 --> 00:54.810
No, but we have to see it
in 3-D.

00:54.879 --> 00:57.079
We saw part one in 3-D,
and the 2-D part two

00:57.148 --> 00:59.148
is not the part two
of the 3-D part one.

01:00.618 --> 01:02.451
He's got you there, Leonard.
Or he doesn't.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.352
I don't really care anymore.

01:04.422 --> 01:05.486
Okay, then,

01:05.556 --> 01:06.833
- we'll go see it in 3-D.
- No.

01:06.857 --> 01:08.869
Sweetie, you shouldn't do things
that make you feel bad.

01:08.893 --> 01:11.327
Well, I'm doing this.

01:11.395 --> 01:12.728
And of course he is.

01:12.797 --> 01:14.697
He is a textbook satisficer.

01:14.765 --> 01:16.098
That's not even a word.

01:16.167 --> 01:17.333
Uh, yes, it is.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.768
According to Nobel Prize-winning
economist Herbert Simon,

01:19.837 --> 01:21.770
satisficing is a
decision-making strategy

01:21.839 --> 01:23.238
whereby a person accepts

01:23.307 --> 01:25.674
whatever available
option is satisfactory

01:25.743 --> 01:27.187
rather than seeking out
a course of action

01:27.211 --> 01:28.477
that would make him happiest,

01:28.546 --> 01:31.013
as I just did when I explained
what satisficing was.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.315
He's right.

01:33.351 --> 01:34.650
No one wanted to hear at.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.418
He knew it, yet
he plowed ahead.

01:37.655 --> 01:39.455
I'm just trying to find a plan

01:39.523 --> 01:40.756
that makes everyone happy.

01:40.825 --> 01:42.024
Except you.

01:42.093 --> 01:44.026
Yeah, Leonard.
What would make you happy?

01:44.095 --> 01:46.228
I could tell you about
satisficing again.

01:46.297 --> 01:47.507
You know,
what would make me happy

01:47.531 --> 01:49.098
is if we just stop talking
about this

01:49.166 --> 01:50.477
and see whatever movie
you guys want to see

01:50.501 --> 01:51.611
whenever you want to see it.

01:51.635 --> 01:53.438
Okay. But next time,
we get to pick.

How's your headache?

02:25.193 --> 02:27.794
It's better.
The throwing up really helped.

02:27.863 --> 02:31.665
Mm. I'm so sorry you missed
the end of the movie.

02:31.733 --> 02:32.899
Oh, it's okay.

02:32.968 --> 02:35.101
Everyone talked about it
so much on the ride home,

02:35.170 --> 02:37.370
I feel like I saw it.

02:37.439 --> 02:39.773
Well, to be fair, you talked
about the bathroom so much,

02:39.841 --> 02:42.042
we felt like we saw that, too.

02:43.211 --> 02:44.377
I think I would've been okay

02:44.446 --> 02:45.912
if we weren't sitting so close.

02:45.981 --> 02:47.747
Well, then,
why did we sit so close?

02:47.816 --> 02:49.883
Sheldon said, "Are these seats
good for everyone?"

02:49.952 --> 02:53.186
What was I supposed to do,
say no, like a maniac? -

02:53.255 --> 02:55.422
Sweetie, you have
got to stand up for yourself.

02:55.490 --> 02:56.668
You know, maybe Sheldon's right.

02:56.692 --> 02:58.725
Maybe you are that word he said.

02:58.794 --> 03:00.026
Satisficer?

03:00.095 --> 03:01.261
Yeah, that!
That's the one.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.997
Boy, sounds way more made-up
when you say it.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.277
I mean, come on,
when was the last time

03:06.301 --> 03:07.979
you did something
totally selfish without worrying

03:08.003 --> 03:09.147
about what anyone else wanted?

03:09.171 --> 03:10.270
Uh...

03:10.339 --> 03:11.604
according to my mother,

03:11.673 --> 03:13.840
I took my sweet time being born.

03:16.912 --> 03:18.645
How is that selfish?

03:18.714 --> 03:21.915
Apparently, she had
dinner reservations.

03:24.553 --> 03:26.519
And this is the telescope room

03:26.588 --> 03:28.955
where I spend a lot
of my evenings.

03:29.024 --> 03:30.690
Where's the telescope?

03:30.759 --> 03:32.425
Hawaii.

03:32.494 --> 03:33.760
That's cool.

03:33.829 --> 03:35.595
Yeah, so, you know...

03:35.664 --> 03:37.097
aloha.

03:40.002 --> 03:42.068
What's that smell?

03:42.137 --> 03:44.204
Uh, everyone has
their own theory.

03:44.272 --> 03:45.805
Dr. Tibourgh thinks it's mold.

03:45.874 --> 03:47.674
I think it's Dr. Tibourgh.

03:49.044 --> 03:50.977
So, what am I looking at?

03:51.046 --> 03:53.413
Ah, this is live information

03:53.482 --> 03:55.415
from the Keck telescope.
It's pretty interesting.

03:55.484 --> 03:58.318
So, I recently observed
some optical flashes.

03:58.387 --> 04:00.587
It could be light bouncing
off a natural object,

04:00.655 --> 04:01.866
but those tend to
be less reflective,

04:01.890 --> 04:03.857
so could be evidence of
something alien-made.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.093
Oh, this suddenly got exciting.

04:07.162 --> 04:08.895
Oh. When you say "exciting,"

04:08.964 --> 04:10.508
do you mean "go back
to my place" exciting

04:10.532 --> 04:12.165
or "hold our breath
and do it here"?

04:15.771 --> 04:17.704
Mahalo.

04:25.247 --> 04:27.180
Do I want to ask?

04:28.250 --> 04:30.183
Oh, w... when I go upstairs,

04:30.252 --> 04:32.585
Penny's gonna make me choose
what we're gonna do tonight

04:32.654 --> 04:34.587
without taking her feelings
into consideration,

04:34.656 --> 04:36.589
and I-I don't know
if I'm up for it.

04:38.593 --> 04:40.527
Poor baby.
When I go upstairs,

04:40.595 --> 04:42.429
Sheldon's gonna give me
a 25-minute lecture

04:42.497 --> 04:45.532
about what Hulk would be like
if he were made of metal.

04:46.902 --> 04:48.234
Part of his ongoing series,

04:48.303 --> 04:51.304
"What If Hulk Were Made
of Other Things?"

04:51.373 --> 04:54.107
I-I've always been
a people pleaser.

04:54.176 --> 04:56.643
Is that so bad?
It's gotten me this far.

04:56.711 --> 04:59.379
What, almost up four
flights of stairs?

05:00.449 --> 05:02.449
Okay, if I go in there

05:02.517 --> 05:05.285
and pick something I want to do
that she also wants to do,

05:05.353 --> 05:07.165
she's gonna think I'm just
picking it to make her happy.

05:07.189 --> 05:08.688
So I feel like

05:08.757 --> 05:10.868
I have to pick something
I know she doesn't want to do

05:10.892 --> 05:12.132
or she's gonna be disappointed.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.493
Right?
What do you think?

05:13.562 --> 05:15.795
Think I've got ice cream
in this bag

05:15.864 --> 05:17.130
that's starting to melt.

05:18.233 --> 05:19.432
I'm sorry.

05:19.501 --> 05:21.868
It's exhausting
being in my head.

05:21.937 --> 05:24.504
Look, when you wanted
Penny, you didn't care

05:24.573 --> 05:26.940
what anybody else
thought or wanted,

05:27.008 --> 05:28.341
including Penny.

05:30.412 --> 05:32.679
That's true.

05:32.747 --> 05:34.948
Yeah, yeah,
there was something I wanted,

05:35.016 --> 05:37.684
I went after it and I got it.

05:37.752 --> 05:40.192
Now you're hiding from it on the
stairs, so it all worked out.

05:42.958 --> 05:44.457
Hey.

05:44.526 --> 05:45.937
I thought about what
I want to do tonight,

05:45.961 --> 05:48.728
and I didn't take your feelings
into consideration at all.

05:49.798 --> 05:51.197
Great.

05:51.266 --> 05:52.732
I want to have sex.

05:53.802 --> 05:56.336
Wow, sex with your wife.

05:56.404 --> 05:59.539
You're really swinging for
the fences there, Hofstadter.

05:59.608 --> 06:01.274
Yeah, we don't have to.

06:01.343 --> 06:02.475
No!

06:02.544 --> 06:03.810
I like it.
Let's go.

06:03.879 --> 06:05.278
Oh, o-okay.

06:05.347 --> 06:06.757
And then after that,
we're gonna watch

06:06.781 --> 06:08.114
<i>Star Trek: Discovery.</i>
- All right.

06:08.183 --> 06:10.950
Well, just a warning, I might be
on my phone for most of it.

06:11.019 --> 06:12.752
That's fine.

06:12.821 --> 06:14.165
Wait, you mean
just the <i>Star Trek...</i>

06:14.189 --> 06:16.222
Actually, I don't care.

06:18.627 --> 06:21.027
And, with apologies
to Lady Gaga,

06:21.096 --> 06:23.563
that's how a star is born.

06:25.467 --> 06:28.168
Told you he was
gonna mention Lady Gaga.

06:29.671 --> 06:31.511
At least he didn't talk
about how much he cried

06:31.573 --> 06:32.805
during that movie.

06:32.874 --> 06:34.140
Although,

06:34.209 --> 06:35.820
if you haven't seen that movie,
you should.

06:35.844 --> 06:37.744
I cried so much.

06:39.481 --> 06:41.214
Well, that's the lecture
for today.

06:41.283 --> 06:43.116
Uh, let's open it up
for questions.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.385
Uh...

06:46.288 --> 06:47.787
Oh, you! Sir, yes.

06:47.856 --> 06:48.922
You have a question?

06:48.990 --> 06:51.791
Yeah. Actually,
I have a two-part question.

06:51.860 --> 06:54.627
Are you sure? I get the sense
it's only one part.

06:55.697 --> 06:57.263
No, no, it's two.

06:57.332 --> 06:59.232
Part one: the new star

06:59.301 --> 07:00.366
you were talking about--

07:00.435 --> 07:02.602
how long did it take
that light to reach Earth?

07:02.671 --> 07:03.970
And part two:

07:04.039 --> 07:05.516
is it true you plant
your friends in the audience

07:05.540 --> 07:07.607
to ask questions?

07:07.676 --> 07:09.609
46,000 years.

07:09.678 --> 07:11.044
And no,
I don't plant my friends,

07:11.112 --> 07:13.479
because apparently,
I don't have any.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.616
Uh, any other questions?

07:16.685 --> 07:19.152
- Uh, yes. You, miss.
- Hi.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.521
I read your paper on specular
reflections. It was great.

07:21.590 --> 07:23.390
- Oh, thank you so much.
- In your conclusion,

07:23.425 --> 07:25.792
you said you couldn't rule out
that light flashes

07:25.860 --> 07:28.027
could be evidence
of alien civilization.

07:28.096 --> 07:31.130
So does that mean
you think it's aliens?

07:31.166 --> 07:33.399
I was just illustrating
that there are many unknowns,

07:33.468 --> 07:34.867
and as scientists, we can't

07:34.936 --> 07:36.736
preemptively rule out
possibilities.

07:36.805 --> 07:38.838
So you think it's aliens.

07:38.907 --> 07:41.107
- A-Actually, no, that's...
- I have a question

07:41.176 --> 07:43.276
about the aliens you found.

07:43.345 --> 07:45.645
That's not what I said, Howard.

07:45.714 --> 07:47.313
Hold on a second.

07:47.382 --> 07:50.216
Do you two know each other?

07:50.285 --> 07:51.651
Yeah.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.852
My sister was--

07:52.921 --> 07:55.888
a-and this is her term--
abducted.

07:57.492 --> 08:00.560
Do you think those could be
the same aliens...

08:00.629 --> 08:03.062
Okay, any other questions? Mm.

08:03.131 --> 08:04.163
Not about aliens?

08:06.101 --> 08:07.300
What?

08:07.369 --> 08:09.213
Do you still want me to
ask the one you gave me?

08:09.237 --> 08:11.671
'Cause it kind of feels
like we're past that.

08:14.476 --> 08:16.542
Ooh, Leonard,
I don't mean to alarm you,

08:16.611 --> 08:19.045
but the Chinese food
smells funny.

08:19.114 --> 08:20.780
That's because it's barbecue.

08:21.850 --> 08:24.417
But it's Chinese food night.

08:24.486 --> 08:25.930
Um, I picked it. You're
the one who told me

08:25.954 --> 08:28.087
to stop being such a
satisficer all the time.

08:28.156 --> 08:29.589
What?
I did not.

08:29.658 --> 08:31.424
I just pointed out
that you were one.

08:31.493 --> 08:33.693
It's what I like best about you.

08:33.761 --> 08:36.696
Well, that and those little
notes you leave in my lunch.

08:38.099 --> 08:40.033
I leave those!

08:41.469 --> 08:43.068
Well, that's disappointing.

08:43.138 --> 08:44.148
I already know
that you heart me.

08:44.172 --> 08:46.472
Now I don't know
if Leonard does.

08:46.541 --> 08:48.308
Well, this is what
we're having for dinner.

08:48.376 --> 08:50.510
You can eat it or not.
I don't care.

08:50.578 --> 08:52.612
I guess that answers
the heart question.

08:52.681 --> 08:55.148
I-It's fine.
We'll have barbecue.

08:55.216 --> 08:57.784
Oh, of course.
I'm nothing if not flexible.

08:57.852 --> 08:59.852
I'm sure that at some point

08:59.921 --> 09:02.288
in the 3,000-year history
of the Chinese empire,

09:02.357 --> 09:04.190
a cavalryman crossing

09:04.259 --> 09:07.126
the Gobi Desert was forced
by hunger to eat his own horse

09:07.195 --> 09:08.272
and roast it over a campfire,

09:08.296 --> 09:10.496
hence, Chinese barbecue.
Let's eat.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.535
Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't
watch the news today.

09:15.603 --> 09:18.104
Has the whole world gone mad?

09:18.173 --> 09:19.839
It's my house.

09:19.908 --> 09:22.709
I'm tired of being told
where I can and can't sit.

09:24.446 --> 09:26.746
You did this.

09:26.815 --> 09:28.715
Amy, grab your meat.
We're leaving in a huff.

09:31.653 --> 09:33.720
I'm sorry, if I don't go now,
it's not a huff.

09:36.925 --> 09:39.025
Don't take this the wrong way,

09:39.094 --> 09:41.494
but that was even more exciting
than the sex.

09:42.897 --> 09:45.898
Don't take this the wrong way,
but yes, it was.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.074

09:55.225 --> 09:56.514
Leonard, where are you going?

09:56.515 --> 09:57.747
Well, to work.

09:57.816 --> 09:59.349
Just trying out
a different route.

09:59.418 --> 10:00.850
Okay.

10:00.919 --> 10:04.454
If we cross the county line,
it's technically kidnapping.

10:04.523 --> 10:07.357
Well, if you don't approve
of my driving, too bad.

10:07.426 --> 10:08.992
This is the new me.
Get used to it.

10:09.060 --> 10:11.060
Fine.
Then this is the new me,

10:11.129 --> 10:13.229
and he finds
the new you tiresome.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.733
How is that different
than the old you?

10:16.802 --> 10:18.835
The new me gives knowing winks.

10:21.873 --> 10:23.273
Well, all these years,

10:23.341 --> 10:25.608
I-I was afraid to say
what I wanted.

10:25.677 --> 10:27.210
You know, even at work,

10:27.279 --> 10:29.079
you know, there's things
I want to accomplish,

10:29.114 --> 10:32.215
but I didn't want to ruffle any
feathers or step on any toes.

10:32.284 --> 10:34.217
Feathers and toes?
Is the new thing you're trying

10:34.286 --> 10:36.953
to accomplish ballroom dancing
with a chicken?

10:37.022 --> 10:40.023
Look at that--
the new me is hilarious.

10:40.091 --> 10:42.492
Always wanted to be
the principal investigator

10:42.561 --> 10:44.761
on a plasma physics study.

10:44.830 --> 10:47.597
Hey, look at that--
the new you's funny, too.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.900
I'm serious.
You know...

10:50.969 --> 10:52.469
I'm gonna put together
a proposal

10:52.537 --> 10:54.617
and tell President Siebert
this is what I want to do.

10:54.673 --> 10:55.839
If he doesn't let me,

10:55.907 --> 10:57.941
there's plenty of other
universities that will.

10:58.009 --> 10:59.709
Sure there are.

11:02.013 --> 11:03.947
Of course you don't
want me to do that,

11:04.015 --> 11:05.577
because you like it when
you're successful and I'm not.

11:05.578 --> 11:07.784
No, you're confusing
causation and...

11:07.853 --> 11:10.520
"Welcome to Alhambra."
Where the heck are we?

11:13.258 --> 11:15.391
Now I'm some sort
of big joke.

11:15.460 --> 11:18.094
I'm even on some
alien conspiracy blog.

11:18.129 --> 11:20.196
See? "Caltech
astrophysicist

11:20.265 --> 11:22.365
finds proof of alien life''

11:23.935 --> 11:26.202
Wow, that is not
a great picture of you.

11:26.271 --> 11:27.770
That's not the point.

11:27.839 --> 11:29.138
Dr. Koothrappali.

11:29.207 --> 11:31.741
I'm surprised to see you in here.
Why is that?

11:31.810 --> 11:32.976
Because the truth...

11:33.044 --> 11:34.978
is out there!

11:37.282 --> 11:39.449
You see? That's what
I'm talking about.

11:39.518 --> 11:41.451
People have been doing
that to me all day.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.286
Relax.
They're just having fun.

11:45.790 --> 11:47.724
Oh, come on!

11:50.161 --> 11:51.161
See? It's fun.

11:58.870 --> 12:00.370
Wow. Déjà vu.

12:01.473 --> 12:03.106
Amy, you're a neuroscientist--

12:03.174 --> 12:05.308
you know the latest research
into déjà vu suggests

12:05.377 --> 12:07.610
it's nothing but
the frontal regions of the brain

12:07.679 --> 12:09.712
attempting to correct
an inaccurate memory.

12:09.781 --> 12:11.748
You telling me stuff
I already know

12:11.816 --> 12:13.483
is definitely déjà vu.

12:14.753 --> 12:16.953
How about telling me
something I don't know,

12:17.022 --> 12:19.689
like why you're
sitting on the stairs.

12:19.758 --> 12:22.659
How can I tell if I'm doing
something for a noble reason

12:22.727 --> 12:24.160
or a selfish reason?

12:25.297 --> 12:27.330
Try saying the thing
in your head

12:27.399 --> 12:30.867
and see if you can add
the words, "That'll show 'em."

12:32.437 --> 12:34.370
Leonard's about to demand a job

12:34.439 --> 12:37.040
that I don't think
the university will give him.

12:37.108 --> 12:39.242
I'm worried he's making
a giant mistake.

12:39.311 --> 12:41.244
But maybe I only
think that because

12:41.313 --> 12:44.113
deep down I don't
want him to succeed.

12:45.517 --> 12:48.017
The fact that you're worried
about your motivation

12:48.086 --> 12:51.521
supports the idea that you
genuinely care for your friend.

12:53.925 --> 12:56.192
I do.

12:56.261 --> 12:57.927
Thank you, Amy.

12:57.996 --> 12:59.128
You know what?

12:59.197 --> 13:00.797
After I've talked to Leonard,

13:00.865 --> 13:03.466
you've earned yourself
a bonus lecture on Sponge Hulk.

13:07.072 --> 13:08.271
That'll show me.

13:12.310 --> 13:15.011
So, I spent the whole day
putting together this proposal,

13:15.080 --> 13:17.246
and tomorrow I'm gonna
tell President Siebert

13:17.315 --> 13:19.415
that this is what
I want to do.

13:19.484 --> 13:22.085
Oh. Well, this...

13:22.153 --> 13:24.787
looks great.

13:24.856 --> 13:27.156
- You didn't even open it.
- Well, no,

13:27.225 --> 13:28.391
it's got a nice, you know,

13:28.460 --> 13:30.727
science-y heft to it. I...

13:30.795 --> 13:32.428
Really proud of
you, sweetie.

13:33.598 --> 13:34.797
Leonard?

13:34.866 --> 13:36.199
- Hmm?
- Um,

13:36.267 --> 13:37.867
I have been agonizing

13:37.936 --> 13:40.036
over whether or not
to say something to you.

13:40.105 --> 13:41.971
Aw. Let me help. Don't.

13:43.074 --> 13:44.407
I have to.

13:44.476 --> 13:47.510
I don't think that you
should demand to be in charge

13:47.579 --> 13:48.911
of a plasma project.

13:48.980 --> 13:50.079
Well, big surprise.

13:50.148 --> 13:52.849
You can't stand the idea
of me succeeding.

13:52.917 --> 13:54.350
No. I'll be honest.

13:54.419 --> 13:57.387
New assertive Leonard is going
to take some getting used to.

13:57.455 --> 14:00.123
But so did
cargo pants Leonard, hmm?

14:00.191 --> 14:02.091
Who, for the record,
I miss.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.727
He always had gum.

14:04.796 --> 14:07.096
Sheldon, if this is what he
wants, he should ask for it.

14:07.165 --> 14:09.198
I mean, what's the worst
that happens? They say no.

14:09.267 --> 14:10.933
Well, I'm not
gonna let them say no.

14:11.002 --> 14:13.970
If they don't want me to quit,
this is what it's gonna take.

14:14.039 --> 14:15.538
Wait, you're gonna quit?

14:15.607 --> 14:18.174
Yeah. It's like you said,
I have to go after what I want,

14:18.243 --> 14:19.876
and if I can't get that
at Caltech,

14:19.944 --> 14:21.984
there are plenty of other
universities in the world.

14:22.047 --> 14:23.546
W... In the world?

14:23.615 --> 14:25.415
I can't even get you
to go to the beach,

14:25.450 --> 14:28.184
and now you want to
move to the world?

14:28.253 --> 14:30.357
Well, I don't want to, but
if that's what I have to do...

14:30.381 --> 14:31.288
Okay, don't you think

14:31.289 --> 14:32.633
threatening to quit
your job is something

14:32.657 --> 14:34.023
you should run by me first?

14:34.092 --> 14:36.259
You said I shouldn't
worry about your feelings.

14:36.327 --> 14:39.028
I meant feelings about things
that I don't care about!

14:39.097 --> 14:40.841
Now, I'm not quite sure
when to jump in here...

14:40.865 --> 14:42.732
- Not now.
- Okay.

14:42.801 --> 14:45.168
Fine, you want to talk about it?
Let's talk about it.

14:45.236 --> 14:47.170
I-I'm not loving
my job right now.

14:47.238 --> 14:49.119
And this is something
that would make me happy.

14:49.297 --> 14:50.351
Don't you want me to be happy?

14:50.375 --> 14:52.076
Oh, I've been dinged
on this before.

14:52.077 --> 14:54.811
Whatever you really think,
you have to say yes.

14:54.879 --> 14:58.281
- Of course I want you to be happy.
- Well played.

14:58.349 --> 15:01.084
Okay, I know this seems scary,

15:01.152 --> 15:03.453
but I put together
a strong proposal.

15:03.521 --> 15:05.855
It's good for me,
it's good for the university.

15:05.924 --> 15:07.757
They're gonna give it to me.

15:07.826 --> 15:09.092
No.

15:10.829 --> 15:12.361
I'm sorry, President Siebert,

15:12.430 --> 15:14.597
but I'm not taking no
for an answer.

15:14.666 --> 15:16.265
I speak a little Russian.

15:16.334 --> 15:18.868
Will you take <i>nyet</i>
for an answer?

15:18.937 --> 15:20.670
I'm serious.

15:20.739 --> 15:22.872
Oh.
Well, that changes everything.

15:22.941 --> 15:24.874
- Really?
- <i>Nyet.</i>

15:27.812 --> 15:30.113
I know a lot of people
have been having fun

15:30.181 --> 15:32.315
claiming that I said
I found alien life.

15:32.383 --> 15:33.783
I want to make it clear

15:33.852 --> 15:36.519
that is not what I said.

15:36.588 --> 15:38.921
I did say that was
one possible explanation.

15:38.990 --> 15:40.923
I don't think
that's something to mock.

15:40.992 --> 15:43.459
Right? It would be arrogant
for us to assume

15:43.528 --> 15:45.728
that we are alone
in the universe.

15:45.797 --> 15:47.897
And as scientists,
we need to remain open

15:47.966 --> 15:50.733
to the possibility
that the truth may sound silly

15:50.802 --> 15:52.168
or far-fetched.

15:52.237 --> 15:55.071
Uh, the round Earth.
Germs that cause diseases.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.405
Subatomic particles.

15:56.474 --> 15:58.407
All these at one time
seemed fanciful.

15:58.476 --> 16:00.743
So who's to say
what science fiction of today

16:00.812 --> 16:02.645
will be the reality of tomorrow?

16:03.748 --> 16:06.082
Will there be colonies on Mars?

16:06.151 --> 16:08.184
Uh, matter transporters?

16:08.253 --> 16:10.686
Perhaps the Loch Ness Monster
is real.

16:10.755 --> 16:13.322
Who knows?
I'm just saying that...

16:13.391 --> 16:15.825
the only way
science moves forward

16:15.894 --> 16:18.494
is to follow the evidence
wherever it leads,

16:18.563 --> 16:21.364
even if it makes us
sound crazy sometimes.

16:21.432 --> 16:23.099
Hey, Bernie,
look at this.

16:23.168 --> 16:25.935
"Caltech astrophysicist claims

16:26.004 --> 16:28.971
Loch Ness Monster is real."

16:33.778 --> 16:35.611
- Hey. How did it go?
- Great.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.946
What, so you got the job?

16:37.015 --> 16:39.048
I did not.

16:39.117 --> 16:41.284
So you quit?
Okay, Leonard, I can't move.

16:41.352 --> 16:44.187
I just bought a six-month
membership to SoulCycle.

16:45.290 --> 16:47.323
Well, I-I didn't quit.

16:47.392 --> 16:48.658
I said I was going to.

16:48.726 --> 16:51.093
I walked out the door
and started crying.

16:51.162 --> 16:54.697
You know, "Oh, my, God, oh, my
God, oh, my God, what'd I do?"

16:54.766 --> 16:57.033
And then he called me back in.

16:57.101 --> 16:58.668
Then he changed his mind?

16:58.736 --> 16:59.802
He did not.

16:59.871 --> 17:01.804
I'm really confused about

17:01.873 --> 17:03.773
how to react to this story.

17:05.042 --> 17:07.343
President Siebert
didn't want to lose me.

17:07.412 --> 17:08.877
Even though
they couldn't make me

17:08.946 --> 17:11.247
a lead investigator
on a plasma team,

17:11.316 --> 17:13.249
there was an opening
for a co-lead

17:13.318 --> 17:14.851
on a photon entanglement team.

17:14.919 --> 17:16.117
How cool is that?

17:16.186 --> 17:19.055
You're gonna have to tell me.

17:20.157 --> 17:21.624
It's really cool.

17:21.693 --> 17:24.093
Yay! Oh, I am so
happy for you.

17:24.162 --> 17:27.597
I almost got what I wanted,
and it never would have happened

17:27.665 --> 17:29.966
if you hadn't almost believed in me.
- Oh.

17:31.202 --> 17:33.102
Let's celebrate.
What do you want to do?

17:33.171 --> 17:35.872
Oh, please don't make me
decide another thing.

17:35.940 --> 17:37.540
Hey, you want to go
to SoulCycle with me?

17:37.575 --> 17:39.809
Give me a minute,
I'll think of something.

17:45.530 --> 17:47.170
Now, I know what
You're you're thinking:

17:47.198 --> 17:50.866
isn't Broccoli Hulk basically
just the Jolly Green Giant?

17:51.936 --> 17:53.903
That <i>is</i> what I was thinking.

17:53.971 --> 17:56.272
Let's never discuss it again.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.441
Really?

17:59.677 --> 18:01.944
- Are you hiding from Penny again?
- No. No, no, no.

18:02.013 --> 18:05.481
I-I went to SoulCycle with her,
and my legs hurt so bad, I...

18:05.550 --> 18:08.084
literally can't stand up.

18:08.152 --> 18:10.719
Sheldon, why don't you
keep him company.

18:12.490 --> 18:13.923
All right.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.927
Hello, Leonard.
Hey.

18:22.733 --> 18:24.600
Have you ever wondered

18:24.669 --> 18:28.137
what the Hulk would be like
if he were made of sherbet?

18:31.142 --> 18:32.708
I give up.

18:33.811 --> 18:35.444
