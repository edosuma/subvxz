WEBVTT

00:01.271 --> 00:05.706
Alright, guys,
it's the last day of battles.

00:05.706 --> 00:06.573
Let's do it.
Anybody got a steal left?

00:06.673 --> 00:07.541
Blake.
Yeah.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.209
So the interesting thing
you haven't seen yet

00:09.309 --> 00:11.478
is when Blake steals,

00:11.578 --> 00:13.447
he usually goes for
the drama.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.349
Oh.
His strategy is
put them through

00:15.449 --> 00:17.518
as much emotional pain
as possible.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.586
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And then rescue them.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.089
Then you can re‐mold them into
the artist you want them to be.
Says a lot.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.424
Re‐mold them.
You beat 'em down
and then build them back-up

00:24.525 --> 00:25.726
how you want 'em.
It's like a Bobby Knight
approach.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.427
Yes. Speaking of that,

00:27.528 --> 00:29.363
let's go beat some people down
right now.
Alright.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.597
Oh, my gosh.
Let's go.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.499
They'll be in therapy
for the next

00:32.599 --> 00:34.501
30 years
unpacking this moment.

00:34.601 --> 00:39.039
KCK3, you are battling

00:39.139 --> 00:40.974
Ryleigh Plank.

00:41.074 --> 00:43.076
Yay!
Oh, my gosh!

00:43.177 --> 00:45.445
That's gonna be so fun!

00:45.546 --> 00:49.449
The song Ariana
picked for you is...

00:49.550 --> 00:52.052
"Come On Over Baby"
by Christina Aguilera.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.588
Oh, my gosh!
Oh!

00:56.156 --> 00:58.125
Yes.

01:01.428 --> 01:03.564

01:05.832 --> 01:07.267
Well, thank you.
Yeah.

01:07.367 --> 01:10.003
I love you.
I love you so much.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.306
I love you more.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.510
So, the next performer
is Ryleigh.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.278
She's amazing.
I'm so excited.

01:18.378 --> 01:20.447
Ryleigh auditioned with "Anyone"
by Demi Lovato.

01:20.547 --> 01:24.184
I saw, and I cried
like you did.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.698
You brought me to tears.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.701
And I really think
that you could win this thing.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.170
Hearing that from somebody

01:43.270 --> 01:45.372
that is the voice of
this generation,

01:45.472 --> 01:50.277
it's an amazing realization
of how far I've come.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.713
I have struggled
with my mental health,

01:52.813 --> 01:56.250
but my mom has been my rock

01:56.350 --> 01:58.719
whenever I'm struggling with
those moments.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.254
Here's my mom.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.489
She was a flutist in college.

02:02.589 --> 02:06.026
Love my girl.
So being somebody
that is a musician,

02:06.126 --> 02:10.097
she has been just out of
this world supportive of me.

02:10.197 --> 02:13.500
She is willing to help me figure
out a riff, figure out a chord,

02:13.600 --> 02:16.737
and she is incredible
as a person and as a musician,

02:16.837 --> 02:20.741
and I just ‐‐
I want the world to know that.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.113
The other brilliant
performers ‐‐ KCK3.

02:26.213 --> 02:27.681
Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.449
They're incredible.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.618
And KCK3 actually auditioned
with "No Tears Left to Cry."

02:31.718 --> 02:33.687
I know.
It was so cool.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.323
I just thought
this is such a tribute to you,

02:36.423 --> 02:38.091
and they're making it
their own.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.194
Yeah, which is amazing.
It was.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.666

02:45.766 --> 02:48.068
Oh, my God!

02:48.168 --> 02:50.304
I work as
a pharmacy tech at a hospital,

02:50.404 --> 02:51.738
and Kaitlynn ‐‐

02:51.839 --> 02:53.240
In school.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.741
I was working at a shoe store,

02:54.842 --> 02:57.110
so it's definitely an upgrade
from what we're doing.

02:57.211 --> 03:01.048
You are the last of my slots
on my team.
Oh!

03:01.148 --> 03:02.416
Doing music together
is something that we want

03:02.516 --> 03:04.017
to make a career out of.
Oh!

03:04.117 --> 03:05.652
So we're so grateful
that Ariana is our coach,

03:05.752 --> 03:06.720
and we're so excited to,

03:06.820 --> 03:09.423
like, jump in
and work with her.
Oh, my God.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.291
This is gonna be
a great pairing, I can t
ell.

03:11.391 --> 03:12.292
I think so, too.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.527
Whoo‐hoo!
Hi!

03:13.627 --> 03:15.095
Yay!

03:15.195 --> 03:16.330
Hello!

03:16.430 --> 03:18.765
Oh, my gosh.
Seeing Kristin Chenoweth

03:18.866 --> 03:20.534
was mind‐blowing.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.704
Growing up as a theater kid,
she is, like, an icon,

03:23.804 --> 03:26.673
and the fact that
I get to get feedback

03:26.773 --> 03:30.577
from somebody on her level
is such an honor.

03:30.677 --> 03:33.280
I was just watching you
on TikTok a couple of days ago.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.515
Was I doing something
inappropriate?

03:34.615 --> 03:36.450
You were going into
the 7‐Eleven.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.051
Oh, I love my Slurpees.
Yes.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.419
I love the video.
I think I know it by heart.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.754
I know you do.
It's like...

03:40.854 --> 03:42.456
"It's National Slurpee Day."

03:42.556 --> 03:43.657
Yes!

03:43.757 --> 03:45.158
I'm very excited.
It's my favorite

03:45.259 --> 03:46.393
day of the year.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.594
That was dead on.
Okay.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.396
No, it's dead on.
Okay.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.298
So, how are you guys feeling?
Hi.

03:51.398 --> 03:55.002
Good, good.
I feel great.
I am so happy about this song.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.504
Yeah, I wanted to give you
something with a little bit

03:57.604 --> 03:59.406
more energy this time,

03:59.506 --> 04:01.575
and I also knew
in my heart and soul

04:01.675 --> 04:03.043
that y'all would nail this,
as well.

04:03.143 --> 04:06.013
Chelsea actually sung this
in show choir,

04:06.113 --> 04:07.614
and us being
the younger siblings,

04:07.714 --> 04:09.449
we would always go to
their shows.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.585
So we already knew it.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.487
This song
is so much fun to sing.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.522
It's so upbeat
and just so much energy,

04:15.622 --> 04:18.025
so you can't help dancing.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.227
I think the best dancer
out of us ‐‐
I can't dance well.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.562
It's between me and you.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.163
We do like to make TikToks.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.699
I would say Kaitlynn
makes the most.
Yeah.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.735
It definitely helps us
to bring in the energy onstage

04:28.836 --> 04:31.738
and just go out there
and perform with each other.
Mm.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.607
Feel free to make
any weird sound

04:33.707 --> 04:35.609
so that your voice
is good and comfy.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.477

harmfully loud.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.672
Like,
I almost left my body.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.607
There's amazingness
happening everywhere

05:40.707 --> 05:42.643
and a couple of things
to talk about.
Mm‐hmm.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.311
I would love to even out
the energies

05:44.411 --> 05:45.479
of the performance
a little bit.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.648
I love these moments
you're finding

05:47.748 --> 05:49.650
and all the fun
that you're having with it.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.452
I want more of that
from you individually, as well,

05:52.553 --> 05:54.154
'cause the harmonies
are so good.

05:54.254 --> 05:57.524
But I don't want it
to feel background singer‐y,

05:57.624 --> 05:59.193

Give us more.
Yeah, I got you.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.977
And, "B,"
don't be afraid of that.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.112
I just really want Kyla
to believe in herself

06:19.213 --> 06:21.682
and find those moments
and take them,

06:21.782 --> 06:23.550
because she should have them.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.686
In your verse,
it's like a little moment

06:25.786 --> 06:28.322
where you jump up to
the high ad lib and you ‐‐

06:28.422 --> 06:29.690
Yes.

06:29.790 --> 06:30.991
Yeah.
And it shouldn't
just be like,

06:31.091 --> 06:32.259
"Here's my big note."
Mm‐hmm.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.328
It should feel emotional.
Mm.

06:34.428 --> 06:35.629
I love Ryleigh's voice.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.398
It's big.
It is diva.

06:38.498 --> 06:41.168
But something that I'm reallyexcited for her to realize

06:41.268 --> 06:44.004
is that she's not
auditioning anymore.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.639
She doesn't always
have to be at a 10.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.674
It's a balance between

06:47.774 --> 06:49.476
storytelling and big diva moments.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.679
Can I give you a thought on ‐‐
on exactly what she's saying?

06:52.779 --> 06:54.681
Ad libs come from what?

06:54.781 --> 06:56.517
Intention.
Intention and acting.

06:56.617 --> 07:00.287
So what's
the very first lyric?
Her verse? "Hey, boy."

07:00.387 --> 07:01.555
Yeah.
"Don't you know."

07:01.655 --> 07:03.490
I‐I present this to you
as a thought.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.125
You have a secret.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.560
That's really smart
to think about

07:06.660 --> 07:08.161
the intention
behind the lyric.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.597
I'm just saying,
go with it from that viewpoint.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.266
Let's see what happens.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.067
♪ Hey, boy, don't you know ♪

07:14.168 --> 07:16.703
♪ I've got something
going on ♪

07:16.803 --> 07:18.438
The fact that Ariana and Kristin

07:18.539 --> 07:22.576
were able to give us pointers
so quickly definitely helped.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.411
I could imagine it
being about a guy,

07:24.511 --> 07:26.046
and I'm singing, like,
with the sass.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.514
But they
definitely pushed us,

07:27.614 --> 07:29.183
and it was really helpful.

What's happening?
You mean
what are you gonna do?

07:46.200 --> 07:48.101
What am I ‐‐ Yeah.
I'm just a guest.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.404
Guys, I quit.
I can't do it.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.706
This is the genius
that is Ariana.

07:52.806 --> 07:57.277
When Ariana said,
"Hey, you three, come forward.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.312
You ‐‐ step back a little bit,"

07:58.412 --> 08:00.414
and then we saw the balance.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.716
That's the genius
of the coach.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.451
Thank you for inspiring.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.987
Thank you guys
for inspiring us.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.223
It's so crazy that,
just a few months ago,

08:09.323 --> 08:13.093
I was working at a roller rink
and I was making pizzas,

08:13.193 --> 08:15.462
and now I'm here hanging out
with Ariana Grande.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.631
So moving on
to the knockouts,

08:17.731 --> 08:20.400
it would be just
a dream come true, honestly.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.401
Get out!

Well, wasn't that fun?

12:09.429 --> 12:12.466
KCK3, I love you all
singing together.

12:12.566 --> 12:16.537
And then Ryleigh
‐ I was like, "What?!"

12:16.637 --> 12:19.039
Ryleigh, you are
like a revelation.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.542
Your physical energy
was so captivating.

12:21.642 --> 12:24.378
Your body is like elastic ‐‐
the way it moves is like...

12:24.478 --> 12:26.547
So intriguing
to watch you perform

12:26.647 --> 12:29.249
and have so much joy
exuding from you and ‐‐

12:29.349 --> 12:31.485
And still able to hit
all those notes.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.453
Yeah. Yeah.
Thank you!

12:33.554 --> 12:34.688
Thank you.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.256
First of all,
just congratulations.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.724
I saw the song selection,
I was like,

12:37.824 --> 12:39.426
"Well, she thinks
a lot of y'all,"

12:39.526 --> 12:41.061
'cause that's a big song.
I do.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.329
And you did so great.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.032
I love the harmonies
from the sisters, KCK3.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.600
That was so cool.
I loved...
Thank you.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.602
...that you each had
your moment, as well.

12:48.702 --> 12:51.171
You all have
very different textures,

12:51.271 --> 12:54.041
but I think that's
why your blend is so beautiful.

12:54.141 --> 12:57.177
And then Ryleigh
‐‐I was like, "What?!"

12:57.277 --> 12:59.446
Like, that little body
just produced that?

12:59.546 --> 13:02.015
I was like, "What?"
I was like ‐‐

13:02.115 --> 13:03.750
And you're ‐‐
And you're moving so much,

13:03.851 --> 13:05.419
and you're just
so into it.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.588
It's so interesting
knowing nothing about you

13:07.688 --> 13:09.456
and me thinking, like,
"Oh, my God.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.992
She is, like, so powerful.
She's so confident."

13:12.092 --> 13:13.227
And then, you know,

13:13.327 --> 13:14.528
your background,
like, saying, like,

13:14.628 --> 13:16.230
you suffer from depression,
like, stuff like that,

13:16.330 --> 13:18.365
like, it's so interesting
'cause I ‐‐

13:18.465 --> 13:21.001
literally, you are
a light on that stage.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.202
Great job.
Thank you.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.071
Thank you so much.
Yeah. Yeah.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.241
KCK3,
when you guys sing together,

13:27.341 --> 13:29.576
it's an incredible sound ‐‐
it's just got incredible pitch.

13:29.676 --> 13:34.248
I think the contrast here for me
is Ryleigh attacks this moment,

13:34.348 --> 13:36.450
you know,
and it's in her body language,

13:36.550 --> 13:40.320
it's in the way she performs,
and she just owns the moment.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.989
Thank you.
Thank you, coaches.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.292
Ari, tough decision here,

13:45.392 --> 13:47.261
but give us some thoughts
on the battle first.

13:47.361 --> 13:50.230
I am so endlessly proud
of all of you

13:50.330 --> 13:53.267
because I feel like there
were some energy imbalances

13:53.367 --> 13:55.135
in the beginning
and we worked through it

13:55.235 --> 13:58.205
in such a way where everybody
truly was able to shine,

13:58.305 --> 14:01.141
and, KCK3,
you each had your solo moments

14:01.241 --> 14:04.578
and owned them so stunningly
and came out of your shells.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.547
Ryleigh,
I'm so proud of you

14:06.647 --> 14:10.150
for picking and choosing
your moments so beautifully.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.586
So I thank you
for your hard, hard work

14:12.686 --> 14:15.222
'cause today was perfect.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.190
Thank you.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.658
Thank you.
Thank you.

14:17.758 --> 14:20.427
Ariana,
not an easy decision here.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.262
Who is the winner
of this battle?

14:26.633 --> 14:27.534
The winner of this battle

14:27.634 --> 14:29.036
is Ryleigh.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.004
Ryleigh Plank
moving on to the knockouts

14:31.104 --> 14:33.540
for Team Ariana!
Thank you. Thank you.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.142
Congratulations!

14:35.242 --> 14:36.343
Good job.
I love you guys.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.546
I think Ryleigh
is just an angel

14:39.646 --> 14:41.181
and a vocal goddess.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.252
She could absolutely go
all the way.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.121
I don't think there's a thing
that that girl can't sing.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.723
Love you.
Great job.

14:49.823 --> 14:52.159
I am so happy.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.628
My heart is going to explode.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.164
Give it up for KCK3!

14:57.297 --> 14:59.066
Great job.

14:59.166 --> 15:02.202
I am so proud of KCK3.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.071
Their growth
has been incredible.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.639
Weren't they great?
I love Ryleigh.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.107

Tricky.

Welcome back to "The Voice."

16:05.265 --> 16:06.500
these people just met
and they have to do a duet,

16:06.600 --> 16:07.734
and that's
what's interesting

16:07.835 --> 16:09.102
about working with
younger people in here

16:09.203 --> 16:10.504
is they're
so young sometimes,

16:10.604 --> 16:12.306
they don't even know
that they're being bold.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.707
I feel like
they also don't know,

16:13.807 --> 16:16.310
like, what they have
in there either yet.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.445
Yeah.
Like, there's a lot in there
that they'll probably

16:18.545 --> 16:19.680
figure out
during this process.

16:19.780 --> 16:21.348
So it's ‐‐
it's just cool to see that.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.017
Speaking of young and gifted,

16:24.117 --> 16:25.419
the next group up is
The Cunningham Sisters

16:25.519 --> 16:27.154
and Parker.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.323
You ready?
I just feel like
I'm on a roller coaster.

16:29.423 --> 16:32.059
I gave them a Lesley Gore song,
"It's My Party."

16:32.159 --> 16:34.127
You can hate it or love it,
but it's happening.

16:34.228 --> 16:36.129
I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.

16:36.230 --> 16:36.997
Come on down, y'all!

16:37.097 --> 16:39.032
What's up, ladies?
Meet Jason Aldean!

16:39.132 --> 16:40.501
Hello, guys. How are you?
Oh, my God!

16:40.601 --> 16:42.569
Whoo!
Nashville party!
How are you?

16:42.669 --> 16:45.973
Our adviser was Jason Aldean.
Yeah.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.574
Oh, my goodness.
It was so exciting.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.309
How are you?
He's Grammy‐nominated.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.144
He's a big deal.
Mm‐hmm.

16:51.245 --> 16:53.347
I feel like you all could do
soulful pop really well.
Mm‐hmm.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.383
And so then I thought if we did
this twist on "It's My Party,"

16:56.483 --> 16:58.218
made, like, this, like,
Lana Del Rey...
Yes!

16:58.318 --> 17:01.221
...like, Amy Winehouse,
Radiohead kind of vibe on it.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.123
Dark, yeah.
I think it's
a little unexpected,

17:03.223 --> 17:05.225
which is kind of
a cool factor...
Yeah.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.127
Oh, yeah.
...and especially if you have
a different version

17:07.227 --> 17:08.562
that's really cool.
That's what I'm hoping
happens here, Jason.

and, you know,

17:25.379 --> 17:27.648
that's something I'm going
through a lot of right now.

17:27.748 --> 17:29.750
About a year ago,
my mom was diagnosed

17:29.850 --> 17:31.985
with frontotemporal dementia,

17:32.085 --> 17:35.656
and about two months ago,
she passed.

17:35.756 --> 17:37.391
I so want to win this battle
for my mom.

17:37.491 --> 17:41.595
It's all because of everything
she and my dad have given me

17:41.695 --> 17:44.164
over the years,
all the strength and support.

17:44.298 --> 17:49.002
My fiancé, Austin,
is wildly supportive, as well,

17:49.102 --> 17:51.371
and he's the best,
and he just proposed.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.073
This is my mom's ring,
actually.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.608
It was her engagement ring,
and it's so special,

17:54.708 --> 17:56.276
and then her bracelet ‐‐

17:56.376 --> 17:59.179
those are things I sort of
draw from when I'm onstage,

17:59.279 --> 18:01.148
and I'll definitely be
wearing them for the battles.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.984
♪ It's my party and I'll... ♪
I'll tell you what ‐‐

18:04.084 --> 18:05.152

♪ ...cry if I want to ♪
Yes!

18:07.221 --> 18:08.722
♪ Cry if I want to ♪
She was so good in the blinds.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.624
She was the last one
to fill my team up,

18:10.724 --> 18:12.593
but I was floored
with what she did.

18:12.693 --> 18:14.328

18:14.428 --> 18:17.064

Macie is the older one,

all these higher notes...

18:35.516 --> 18:37.184
It's incredible.

18:38.185 --> 18:41.054
Oh, man.
So it's a really good idea ‐‐

18:41.154 --> 18:43.090
at least we know that.
It's a really good idea.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.158
It's great.
You guys sound great together.
Oh!

18:45.259 --> 18:47.995
And I love the song 'cause
it's nothing that's current

18:48.095 --> 18:49.530
that people have heard,
you know,

18:49.630 --> 18:51.331
a million times lately.
Yes!

18:51.431 --> 18:54.334
Parker, oh, my God, your voice,
like, went to a different place.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.103
Wow!

18:56.203 --> 18:58.172
It's like there's some,
like, jazz

18:58.272 --> 19:00.474
and some country
and some pop.
Country, yeah. What?!

19:00.574 --> 19:02.409
And it sounds great ‐‐
when you join in with them,

19:02.509 --> 19:04.044
it's like...
Oh!

19:04.144 --> 19:05.179
You guys complement
each other really well.

19:05.279 --> 19:06.647
That's really not
what I expected.

19:06.747 --> 19:07.981
How old are you guys?

19:08.081 --> 19:09.416
I'm 15.
I'm 14.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.751
Good Lord.

19:10.851 --> 19:12.553
I think anytime
you see somebody

19:12.653 --> 19:14.354
who's that good that young,

19:14.454 --> 19:16.056
it definitely
is gonna get your attention.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.658
Family harmonies are, like,

19:17.758 --> 19:19.159
doesn't get any tighter,
right?
Yeah.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.261
But when you started singing
by yourself, too,

19:21.361 --> 19:23.130
it was like both of you guys
are like great singers.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.565
They're, like,
individual artists, yeah.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.099
So that's a dynamic
I feel like

19:26.200 --> 19:27.401
you don't really see a lot.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.535
When you come in on...

19:28.635 --> 19:31.138
♪ It's my party and I'll ♪

19:31.238 --> 19:33.340

19:33.440 --> 19:35.475
♪ It's my party and ♪

19:35.576 --> 19:37.744
Yes.
I want you emphasizing "my."

19:37.845 --> 19:39.346
Okay.
"It's my party, girl,

19:39.446 --> 19:40.714
and you just
left with my man."
Right.

19:40.814 --> 19:42.516
You know
what I'm saying?
Yes.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.084
They haven't
got there yet, Kelly.
Yeah. What? Yeah.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.352
You've been to a party...
How old are you?

19:45.452 --> 19:47.120
...and you like someone
and another girl

19:47.221 --> 19:48.422
is creeping up on them.
I know it's happened.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.991
Happens at all ages,
and you have the harder job

19:51.091 --> 19:53.393
on those lower notes
of being just as emotional.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.562
It's super exciting to, like,
be out of the box

19:55.662 --> 19:58.699
and learn new things,
and Kelly's teaching us a lot.
Mm‐hmm.

19:58.799 --> 20:00.767
Growing up only singing
at church,

20:00.868 --> 20:02.369
we didn't focus
on anyone around us,

20:02.469 --> 20:06.206
but on "The Voice" stage,
it's, like, all eyes on you.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.675
We come from a long line
of musicians

20:08.775 --> 20:10.110
and recording artists.
Mm‐hmm.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.645
Our great‐grandfather,
he was a leader

20:11.745 --> 20:13.680
of the band called
Holy City Travelers.

20:13.780 --> 20:17.117
So it kind of runs in the family
for us to be singing.
Yeah.

20:17.217 --> 20:20.120
It was a really long, like,
journey, finding our voices

20:20.220 --> 20:22.623
and going through, like,
the super hard times at school

20:22.723 --> 20:24.391
and, like, getting bullied,

20:24.491 --> 20:26.193
but we had each other's backs
the whole way through it,

20:26.293 --> 20:27.761
and now we're
The Cunningham Sisters,

20:27.861 --> 20:29.296
and now we're on the show.

20:31.131 --> 20:34.101
We grew stronger together,
we grew stronger with our family.
Mm‐hmm.

20:34.201 --> 20:36.103
...and now I understand
what they mean

20:36.203 --> 20:37.571
when they say
dreams come true.

Yeah.

the bends and all that...
Too much in the moment.

Tricky.

24:32.306 --> 24:34.374
Yeah. I'll start
with The Cunningham Sisters.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.477
How do you not instantly
fall in love with these two?

24:37.578 --> 24:39.613
Oh, thank you.
And your talent
is incredible.

24:41.415 --> 24:45.085
Parker, who was, apparently,
one chair turned around ‐‐

24:45.185 --> 24:46.587
sadly for you,
it was Kelly.

24:46.687 --> 24:48.722
I'm sorry about that.
Aw, come on.

24:48.822 --> 24:50.357
That's my girl.
But ‐‐ But I thought

24:50.457 --> 24:52.359
you sounded incredible,

24:52.459 --> 24:55.095
but you were up against
The Cunningham Sisters.

24:55.195 --> 24:56.430
You want my advice?
Yes.

24:56.530 --> 24:57.698
Quit.

25:00.567 --> 25:03.136
I just wanted to echo Blake
and say, you know,

25:03.237 --> 25:04.972
Parker, you're so talented.

25:05.072 --> 25:07.741
But I think what
The Cunningham Sisters are doing

25:07.841 --> 25:09.209
is so special.

25:09.309 --> 25:10.644
Although it's a difficult one

25:10.744 --> 25:12.980
because everyone sounded
beautiful on this,

25:13.080 --> 25:15.449
I would lean towards
The Cunningham Sisters.

25:17.351 --> 25:22.256
Parker, I feel like you were
consistently the best vocalist,

25:22.356 --> 25:25.292
but there's something
so dynamic and interesting

25:25.392 --> 25:26.760
about The Cunningham Sisters.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.328
You all should have a TV show.

25:28.428 --> 25:30.130
I feel like you all should....

25:30.230 --> 25:32.432
Like, there's so much
that intrigues me about you,

25:32.533 --> 25:36.403
and I want to see where you go,
so I would probably pick them.

25:36.503 --> 25:38.672
But I'm hesitant
because I feel like Parker

25:38.772 --> 25:41.141
gave the best
vocal performance.

25:41.241 --> 25:43.177
Thank you, coaches.

25:43.277 --> 25:46.180
Kel, tough decision coming up.
Give me some thoughts.

25:46.280 --> 25:49.416
You did such
a beautiful job.

25:49.516 --> 25:51.652
The last note, where you
all kind of, sort of...

25:54.121 --> 25:55.455
That was crazy.
It worked.

25:55.556 --> 25:57.424
It's that beautiful thing
where you all really found

25:57.524 --> 26:00.127
the right notes that you
landed on, and you nailed it.

26:00.227 --> 26:01.528
And I just want to
congratulate you on that

26:01.628 --> 26:02.763
'cause that was hard.

26:02.863 --> 26:05.032
You're all really great.

26:05.132 --> 26:07.434
And I know
I have to make a choice.

26:07.534 --> 26:10.304
Kelly, tough decision here,
but the time has come.

26:10.404 --> 26:11.705
Who's the winner
of this battle?

26:14.575 --> 26:15.642
Man...

26:17.244 --> 26:21.682
I'm so bummed right now.
Okay. Um...

26:21.782 --> 26:25.052
I ‐‐ I just can't fight
the, like,

26:25.152 --> 26:27.421
what is gonna
happen in my heart,

26:27.521 --> 26:29.523
so I have to pick.

26:29.623 --> 26:33.126
The winner of this battle
is The Cunningham Sisters.

26:33.227 --> 26:34.761
The Cunningham Sisters

26:34.862 --> 26:38.098
are moving on to the knockouts!

26:38.198 --> 26:39.299
I think
the thing that really

26:39.399 --> 26:41.134
steals me about
The Cunningham Sisters

26:41.235 --> 26:44.538
is just to have that kind
of confidence and precision

26:44.638 --> 26:46.240
at such a young age.

26:46.373 --> 26:48.342
Like, imagine
this whole journey.

26:48.442 --> 26:50.477
I think anything I kind of throw
at them, like, a challenge,

26:50.577 --> 26:53.046
they like it and they kind
of grow in that arena,

26:53.146 --> 26:54.615
so I'm very excited about it.

26:54.715 --> 26:57.751
Give it up for Parker McKay,
ladies and gentlemen!

26:59.686 --> 27:01.355
You did awesome, Parker.

27:01.455 --> 27:03.357
It was really hard
to watch Parker go home,

27:03.457 --> 27:07.060
but, honest to God, my team
is so stacked this season.

27:07.160 --> 27:08.562
Even the ones going home,
you know,

27:08.662 --> 27:10.430
could have eventually
maybe made the finale.

27:10.531 --> 27:13.100
Like, it's just a really
incredible team this year.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.302
The girls ‐‐
their tones are...

27:15.402 --> 27:17.171
They can sing.
...so good.

27:17.271 --> 27:18.739
The youngest one, Marie,
she's the one...

27:18.839 --> 27:21.041
That's nuts.
...holding up all
the depth of it.

27:21.141 --> 27:23.143
Also how she stepped in...

29:54.828 --> 29:57.130
Oh, sick!
And I was so excited.

29:57.231 --> 29:59.633
And I was telling him
when he auditioned

29:59.733 --> 30:02.436
that I heard him
singing like Luther.

You can hear the storytelling.

I try to tell them ‐‐

33:09.256 --> 33:11.058
doesn't matter what song
you sing ‐‐

33:11.158 --> 33:12.659

but take them on a ride

33:12.759 --> 33:14.428

33:14.528 --> 33:16.163
If my grandmother, Muzette,

33:16.263 --> 33:18.098
who just recently passed away,
was still here,

33:18.198 --> 33:20.667
she would be bragging
to everybody in her church.

33:20.767 --> 33:22.469
"My grandson on TV."
You know? So...

33:22.569 --> 33:24.505
My grandmother would love it

33:24.605 --> 33:26.240
if she knew
I was doing a Luther song.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.976
Like, "Boy, you better
sing that song."

33:29.076 --> 33:30.477

that kept me in line.

Yeah. That's right.

I'm thinking about
how I'm here and I'm now.

33:56.303 --> 33:58.138

And I beat stage 4 cancer.

33:58.238 --> 34:00.407
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
Whoo!

34:00.507 --> 34:02.409
I'm looking at
the song and interpreting it

34:02.509 --> 34:04.678
from not just a standpoint
of being in love,

34:04.778 --> 34:06.513
but being in love with my life.

34:06.613 --> 34:09.316
Since going through the storm
of stage 4 cancer,

Yeah! Give it up for 'em!
I love it!

38:25.839 --> 38:27.474
That was just
beautiful singing.

38:27.574 --> 38:29.376
Y'all are so
evenly matched.

38:29.476 --> 38:32.546
You both did some really
cool stuff that was so moving.

38:34.281 --> 38:37.217
Jonathan, you have
this really cool vibrato, man.

38:37.317 --> 38:40.120
And then, Paris, you have
this texture to your voice

38:40.220 --> 38:42.990
that is super captivating.
Thank you so much.

38:43.090 --> 38:45.659
There's something
about you, Paris,

38:45.759 --> 38:47.594
that I keep
gravitating towards.

38:47.694 --> 38:50.030
But honest to God, I was playing
Ping‐Pong the whole time.
Mm‐hmm.

38:50.130 --> 38:52.232
I wish ‐‐ I mean, you could go
with literally either one.

38:52.332 --> 38:53.100
Yeah.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.068
That literally sounded
like a record.

38:55.169 --> 38:57.271
It was incredible.
I mean, I want to hear it again.

38:57.371 --> 38:58.739
Paris, I love your voice.

38:58.839 --> 39:00.607
You have such a clean tone.

39:00.707 --> 39:02.342
And, Jonathan,
same thing ‐‐

39:02.442 --> 39:03.577
I love your voice.

39:03.677 --> 39:05.379
You have more
of a vibrato.

39:05.479 --> 39:07.981
Maybe that's what made that
blend work so well together

39:08.081 --> 39:10.083
was your clean tone
with his vibrato.

39:10.184 --> 39:11.652
I don't know,
but it was great.

39:11.752 --> 39:15.289
I normally will stick my neck
out and say who I would choose,

39:15.389 --> 39:16.623
but I don't know.

39:16.723 --> 39:18.659
I‐I choose Carson.

39:20.527 --> 39:22.296
Yeah. Always,
always choose Carson.

39:22.396 --> 39:26.166
Jonathan, Paris,
that was so incredible.

39:26.266 --> 39:28.268
You're both
world‐class singers.

39:28.368 --> 39:30.270
Your vibratos
are so unique.

39:30.370 --> 39:32.439
But then, I felt like, when you
were singing at the same time,

39:32.539 --> 39:35.275
they were circling around
at the same exact speed.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.110
I was like,
"What kind of witchcraft?"

39:37.211 --> 39:38.645
And so this was ‐‐ It was ‐‐

39:38.745 --> 39:40.614
It was so captivating
and amazing.

39:40.714 --> 39:42.115
This is really hard,

39:42.216 --> 39:44.251
and I am also going to be
of no help.

39:44.351 --> 39:45.986
I don't know
what you do here.

39:46.086 --> 39:47.354
Wow.

39:47.454 --> 39:48.722
Thank you, coaches.

39:48.822 --> 39:50.290
I'm sorry.

39:50.390 --> 39:52.125
Not sure you got a lot
of help there, John.

39:52.226 --> 39:53.327
Give us some thoughts
on the battle.

39:53.427 --> 39:56.263
Everyone said
how thoroughly impressive

39:56.363 --> 39:58.332
and ‐‐ and captivating
both of you are.

39:58.432 --> 40:00.601
And there's no right answer
about who was better.

40:00.701 --> 40:03.670
Jonathan, your tone is a little
silkier, a little smoother.

40:03.770 --> 40:05.472
I do love that vibrato.

40:05.572 --> 40:08.609
And then, Paris, your voice
does have a little more texture

40:08.709 --> 40:10.244
and a little more
grit to it,

40:10.344 --> 40:13.146
but it's also rangy and smooth
when it needs to be.

40:13.247 --> 40:15.282
And you are both
so evenly matched,

40:15.382 --> 40:17.150
and I've gone back and forth
about it.

40:17.251 --> 40:21.021
You both were as great as you
needed to be to keep going.

40:21.121 --> 40:23.423
So thank you for making
my job difficult,

40:23.524 --> 40:25.325
but that just means
you all were awesome.

40:25.425 --> 40:27.027
You really were.

40:27.127 --> 40:29.162
John, the time has come.

40:29.263 --> 40:30.564
Who is the winner
of this battle?

40:33.867 --> 40:35.502
The winner of this battle...

40:37.804 --> 40:39.473
...is Paris.

40:39.573 --> 40:42.176
Paris Winningham!

40:42.276 --> 40:43.544
You are moving on to
the knockouts. Congratulations!

40:43.644 --> 40:46.246
Picking a winner
was almost like a coin toss.

40:46.346 --> 40:49.483
My only slight preference
for Paris

40:49.583 --> 40:51.051
is something about his energy.

40:51.151 --> 40:52.619
I like
that bounce that he has.

40:52.719 --> 40:54.188
Thank you so much.
Thanks, John.

40:54.288 --> 40:55.522
That kind of energy
is really infectious.

40:55.622 --> 40:57.391
If you'd have asked me
last year if I'd be here,

40:57.491 --> 40:59.526
I wouldn't have believed it,
but to get here now

40:59.626 --> 41:02.196
and to stand on the biggest
stage I've ever been on,

41:02.296 --> 41:04.464
I'm overwhelmed,
and ‐‐ and I can't say enough.

41:04.565 --> 41:07.367
I'm just ‐‐ I'm truly thankful.

41:07.467 --> 41:09.636
Coaches, I'll remind you
Jonathan's available to steal.

41:09.736 --> 41:12.105
Jonathan, anything you'd like to
say to your coach?

41:12.206 --> 41:14.408
It's not lost on me
singing a Luther song

41:14.508 --> 41:16.143
to someone
who has inspired me

41:16.243 --> 41:17.978
since I was in middle school.

41:18.078 --> 41:20.314
Like, the magnitude
of this moment,

41:20.414 --> 41:22.683
and being here on this stage,
it's a bucket list.

41:22.783 --> 41:24.318
So, thank you.
You're amazing, Jonathan.

41:24.418 --> 41:25.752
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

41:25.853 --> 41:28.488
Hey!

41:28.589 --> 41:30.090
What?!
Yeah!

41:30.190 --> 41:32.726
That is a steal from
Blake Shelton!

41:36.096 --> 41:37.397
You're not leaving.

41:37.497 --> 41:39.132
They had such
an incredible performance.

41:39.233 --> 41:40.567
I was gonna use my steal...
Yes!

41:40.667 --> 41:43.203
...on either one of those guys,
to be honest with you.

41:43.303 --> 41:45.472
Jonathan's voice
is unbelievable.

41:45.572 --> 41:49.309
He's just a very tasteful
and talented vocalist.

41:49.409 --> 41:51.545
He's an incredible addition
to Team Blake.

41:51.645 --> 41:53.380
You're not leaving.
What are you talking about?

41:53.480 --> 41:55.215
I'm sure Blake would love

41:55.315 --> 41:57.217
for Jonathan to go on
and do well,

41:57.317 --> 42:00.087
and then he can gloat about
how he was a better coach.

42:00.187 --> 42:02.089
But I'm rooting for Jonathan,
no matter what.

42:02.189 --> 42:04.124
I love Jonathan as a vocalist,

42:04.224 --> 42:06.059
and I only want
the best for him.

42:06.159 --> 42:07.294
I am looking forward
to the knockouts.

42:07.394 --> 42:09.029
He came home.

42:09.129 --> 42:11.598
He came home to Team Blake.
I came home!

42:11.698 --> 42:14.434
I did say moments before
to Blake that he had to steal.

42:14.535 --> 42:15.969
Oh, yeah,
she was bullying me.

42:16.069 --> 42:17.404
She's known for that.
