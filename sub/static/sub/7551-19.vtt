[Tires screech]

00:25.357 --> 00:27.318
Wait! Please!

00:27.338 --> 00:28.795
We can talk about this!

00:28.815 --> 00:29.787
[Panting]

00:29.796 --> 00:31.163
No! No!

00:31.847 --> 00:32.831
No!

00:33.213 --> 00:34.199
A crime is a wrong

00:34.233 --> 00:37.169
arising from the violation
of a public duty.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.770
A tort is a wrong

00:38.805 --> 00:40.772
arising from the violation
of a private duty.

00:40.807 --> 00:41.773
Yes.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.776
Okay. I think my brain
is crammed to the limit.

00:44.811 --> 00:47.546
Well, I think you and your brain
are more than ready.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.881
Hey, Alexis. don't you have
a midterm this morning?

00:49.916 --> 00:51.283
I'm leaving now.

00:51.317 --> 00:54.386
Beckett was just giving me
a last-minute review.

00:54.420 --> 00:55.520
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.521
- Mwah.
- Thanks for your help.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.190
Bye. [Smooches]

00:58.224 --> 00:59.592
Good luck!

00:59.803 --> 01:01.560
[Door opens]

01:01.594 --> 01:03.528
You know,
she's got an amazing brain.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.964
I mean, if she wanted to,
she'd make an incredible lawyer.

01:05.998 --> 01:08.800
Yeah. Like I don't lose
enough arguments to her already.

01:09.812 --> 01:10.769
What about you?

01:10.803 --> 01:13.438
You ever regret it,
not getting your law degree?

01:13.472 --> 01:16.141
Um, I'd rather take criminals
down than send them up.

01:16.175 --> 01:17.375
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.577
Because with your mind,

01:18.611 --> 01:19.911
bet you could have made
chief justice.

01:19.946 --> 01:21.446
You have all the qualifications.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.049
You're smart,
you are intimidating,

01:24.083 --> 01:26.117
and you look very, very good
in a robe.

01:26.152 --> 01:27.118
Wow.

01:27.153 --> 01:28.186
- Really?
- Mm.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.322
Care to take a 10-minute recess
in my chambers?

01:30.356 --> 01:31.756
If it please the court, I would.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.124
[Laughs]

01:33.159 --> 01:34.326
[Cellphone rings]
Oh.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.061
I think we're gonna need
a continuance.

01:36.095 --> 01:36.795
Uh, objection.

01:36.829 --> 01:38.066
[Cellphone beeps] Overruled.

01:38.086 --> 01:39.580
Beckett.

01:41.115 --> 01:42.934
Castle: Ryan, give it to me.

01:42.969 --> 01:44.402
Sorry, Castle. I'm not telling.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.437
That's too bad. I already know.

01:45.471 --> 01:48.506
It's John Legend,
"All of me cuffed all of you."

01:48.541 --> 01:49.741
[Laughing] No.

01:49.775 --> 01:50.876
Wait a minute.
Are... are you guys

01:50.910 --> 01:53.011
talking about the policeman's
benevolent fundraiser?

01:53.045 --> 01:54.946
Yeah, the talent competition
is on Friday night,

01:54.981 --> 01:56.681
but he won't tell me
what he and Espo are doing.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.950
So, how are you guys
even gonna top

01:58.985 --> 02:01.486
the "Dirty Dancing" lift scene
from last year?

02:01.520 --> 02:04.789
Ah. "Crime of our lives."
Classic Espo/Ryan.

02:04.824 --> 02:07.092
No, rest assured,
as two-time champs,

02:07.126 --> 02:09.828
whatever we do is gonna
blow the rest of the field away.

02:09.862 --> 02:11.997
Well, that's only because,
not being a cop, I'm ineligible.

02:12.031 --> 02:13.531
But if Beckett and I
were competing,

02:13.566 --> 02:14.933
you'd be out a trophy.

02:14.967 --> 02:16.701
Oh, yeah. We'd so take you down.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.837
[Chuckling]
Well, back in reality,

02:18.871 --> 02:20.839
our John Doe
was found this morning

02:20.873 --> 02:22.274
by sanitation workers.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.942
No phone, no wallet.

02:23.976 --> 02:24.876
Cause?

02:24.911 --> 02:27.212
Blunt-force trauma
to the back of the head.

02:27.246 --> 02:29.381
Probably a pipe
or a baseball bat.

02:29.415 --> 02:30.882
Based on lividity,
I'd say it happened

02:30.917 --> 02:33.051
between 12:00 and 2:00 a.m.
this morning.

02:33.085 --> 02:34.185
Any witnesses?

02:34.220 --> 02:36.621
A guy who lives nearby
heard screams around 1:00 a.m.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.024
He looked out his window.
He saw a car speeding away.

02:39.378 --> 02:40.959
He get a make and model?

02:40.993 --> 02:43.695
Just taillights. But he said
it looked like a sports car.

02:43.729 --> 02:45.330
Ryan and I are gonna keep
looking for witnesses

02:45.364 --> 02:46.731
and street-cam footage,

02:46.766 --> 02:48.867
but it's an industrial area,
so coverage is spotty.

02:48.901 --> 02:50.368
Wait a minute.
I think I know this guy.

02:50.403 --> 02:52.470
He's that personal-injury
attorney on TV

02:52.505 --> 02:53.405
who has the late-night ads.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.307
Oh, my God! You're right!
That's, uh...

02:55.341 --> 02:57.175
- The Pitbull.
- The Pitbull.

02:57.209 --> 02:58.543
The Pitbull?

02:58.577 --> 03:01.012
Yeah.
Richie "the Pitbull" Falco.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.247
Come on, man.
You've seen the ads.

03:02.281 --> 03:04.049
A guy's head on a dog's body.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.818
[As Pitbull] "You been in an accident?
Take the law by the tail."

03:06.852 --> 03:09.721
[As Pitbull] "And get a bite
at the settlement you deserve."

03:09.755 --> 03:10.655
"I'll make the law"...

03:10.690 --> 03:12.057
All: Your bitch!

03:12.552 --> 03:15.060
"El Pitbull
tambien habla espanol."

03:15.094 --> 03:16.528
Why am I the only one who's
never seen this commercial?

03:16.562 --> 03:17.929
Because it comes on
late at night,

03:17.964 --> 03:18.997
and when you're
not moonlighting,

03:19.031 --> 03:20.565
your honey-milk-sipping ass
is in bed by 10:00.

03:21.697 --> 03:23.234
Why would anyone want
to kill the Pitbull?

03:23.269 --> 03:26.104
Maybe CSU will get lucky
and find the murder weapon.

03:26.138 --> 03:27.605
Meanwhile, let's get
the body to the morgue

03:27.640 --> 03:28.640
and see what it can tell us.

03:28.674 --> 03:30.542
Castle, you and I
should go to Pitbull's office,

03:30.576 --> 03:32.444
see what we can find there.

03:32.478 --> 03:33.511
<i>Been in an accident?</i>

03:33.546 --> 03:34.913
<i>Take the law by the tail</i>

03:34.947 --> 03:36.247
<i>and get a bite
at the settlement you deserve.</i>

03:36.282 --> 03:38.016
<i>I'll fight for you,
the little guy,</i>

03:38.050 --> 03:39.918
<i>because pitbulls and underdogs
stick together.</i>

03:39.952 --> 03:42.220
<i>Remember, I'll make the law
your bitch!</i>

03:42.254 --> 03:43.455
<i>Ruff!</i>

03:43.489 --> 03:46.024
<i>Ruff! Ruff!</i>

03:48.594 --> 03:49.394
Wow.

03:49.428 --> 03:51.062
Richie's clients
may be suffering,

03:51.097 --> 03:51.997
but his business sure wasn't.

03:52.031 --> 03:53.765
Yeah, well,
there's always gonna be people

03:53.799 --> 03:54.866
looking for a quick settlement

03:54.900 --> 03:57.102
and plenty of opportunistic
bottom-feeders like Richie

03:57.136 --> 03:58.939
ready to help them cash in.

03:58.959 --> 04:00.372
I bet half these people
are faking.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.040
Mm.

04:02.074 --> 04:03.041
- See that guy over there?
- Mmhmm.

04:03.075 --> 04:05.143
Watch this. Excuse me, sir?

04:05.177 --> 04:07.245
Could you throw this away
for me?

04:07.279 --> 04:08.613
Mnh!

04:08.647 --> 04:11.649
Sorry. My aim is... a little...

04:11.684 --> 04:13.318
Maybe... he's probably legit.

04:13.352 --> 04:15.286
Sorry for the wait, folks.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.055
I'm sure Pitbull will be here
any minute.

04:20.493 --> 04:23.498
The way h-he's been acting
the last few days, I...

04:23.518 --> 04:24.677
[Sniffles]

04:24.697 --> 04:25.964
I knew something was wrong.

04:25.998 --> 04:27.365
How was he acting?

04:27.400 --> 04:28.567
Anxious. Paranoid.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.069
Before he'd leave the office,
he'd look out the window.

04:31.103 --> 04:33.772
It's like he thought
someone might be watching him.

04:33.806 --> 04:35.373
And yesterday morning,

04:35.408 --> 04:37.876
he called to say
that he wasn't coming in at all.

04:37.910 --> 04:38.910
Was that unusual?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.912
He <i>never</i> missed a day

04:40.947 --> 04:43.148
in the three years
I worked for him.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.083
Do you know what was going on?

04:45.117 --> 04:46.351
He wouldn't talk about it.

04:46.385 --> 04:48.620
I-I-I asked if it had something
to do with one of the cases,

04:48.654 --> 04:50.016
and he...

04:51.324 --> 04:53.758
he said no, and he, uh,
told me not to worry...

04:53.793 --> 04:55.160
[Sniffles]

04:55.194 --> 04:57.294
And that it would
all be over soon.

04:57.679 --> 04:59.831
Was he having
any problems with anyone?

04:59.866 --> 05:01.800
Uh, clients? A girlfriend?

05:01.834 --> 05:04.202
He... didn't have a girlfriend.

05:05.447 --> 05:07.572
I kept hoping, but...

05:07.607 --> 05:08.607
Look, I...

05:08.641 --> 05:10.008
[Chuckles]

05:10.042 --> 05:11.910
I know
what you guys are thinking.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.913
Personal-injury lawyers
are gutter rats, right?

05:14.947 --> 05:16.848
But Richie was different.

05:16.883 --> 05:17.916
He really cared.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.685
He thought the law was there
to protect <i>everyone</i>

05:20.720 --> 05:22.520
and not just corporations
who could afford it.

05:22.555 --> 05:25.090
And his clients,
they loved him for it.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.925
And his adversaries?

05:26.959 --> 05:29.928
S-sure, people he sued
got pissed sometimes.

05:29.962 --> 05:31.763
I mean, he won
some big settlements.

05:31.797 --> 05:34.966
But nothing I can imagine
anyone killing for.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.968
Ms. Klein, I need a list
of all of his active cases,

05:37.003 --> 05:38.870
along with anyone
that he's won a judgment against

05:38.905 --> 05:40.505
over the last few years.

05:40.525 --> 05:41.696
Of course.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.609
So, I understand that Mr. Falco
lived in Brooklyn.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.311
Yeah... Park Slope.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.880
His body
was found in Hamilton heights.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.982
Do you have any idea what he was
doing up there last night?

05:51.017 --> 05:53.852
St. Simon's is up there.

05:53.886 --> 05:54.886
- The hospital?
- Yeah.

05:54.921 --> 05:58.723
Sometimes he would do the rounds
at emergency rooms

05:58.758 --> 06:00.859
to see if anyone
needed his services.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.963
Got your text.
You have something for us?

06:04.997 --> 06:08.199
Yep. I know what your victim
was doing before he died.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.035
- What?
- Unh-unh.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.037
You first.

06:13.406 --> 06:14.306
Ohhh. I get it.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.474
She wants us to tell her
about our routine.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.210
Uh, you know that we cannot
be giving that away, girl.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.079
You are gonna have to
buy a ticket,

06:21.113 --> 06:22.514
just like everyone else.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.883
Now, what have you got?

06:24.917 --> 06:26.217
Fine.

06:26.252 --> 06:29.087
Pitbull spent some time
in the countryside.

06:29.121 --> 06:30.889
You see
this sticky yellow powder

06:30.923 --> 06:33.058
on Richie's pant leg
about ankle high?

06:33.092 --> 06:35.093
Pollen
from the tussilago flower,

06:35.127 --> 06:36.895
also know as coltsfoot.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.898
It's not found in the city,
so it didn't happen here.

06:39.932 --> 06:41.499
But there's something else...

06:41.534 --> 06:44.869
something a lot less fun
than frolicking in the flowers.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.140
Those are taser marks.

06:50.977 --> 06:51.876
He was tortured?

06:51.911 --> 06:53.923
Yeah, Lanie says
the injuries he sustained

06:53.943 --> 06:55.246
were within an hour
of his death.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.584
So either the killer
wanted something from him,

06:57.604 --> 06:58.883
something Pitbull
didn't want to give up...

06:58.918 --> 07:00.512
Or the killer
wanted him to suffer.

07:00.532 --> 07:02.560
This might have something to do
with one of his old cases.

07:02.580 --> 07:05.129
Yeah, but nothing jumped out
from his client list.

07:05.149 --> 07:07.387
It's all slip-and-falls,
workmen's comp,

07:07.407 --> 07:09.094
insurance claims...

07:09.128 --> 07:10.762
nothing
that would explain torture

07:10.796 --> 07:12.197
or a trip outside of the city.

07:12.231 --> 07:13.798
So where did he go?

07:13.833 --> 07:15.855
Mr. Castle? A word?

07:15.875 --> 07:17.374
Of course.

07:18.237 --> 07:21.788
As you know, the PBA talent
competition is this Friday,

07:21.808 --> 07:25.177
and every year, we line up
a celebrity to perform.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.545
Yeah, to help
boost ticket sales.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.913
Isn't Kimmel doing it this year?

07:27.947 --> 07:29.080
He was <i>supposed</i> to,

07:29.115 --> 07:30.916
but due to a last-second
conflict, he just dropped out,

07:30.950 --> 07:32.017
What?!

07:32.051 --> 07:34.886
And I've been told we need
a replacement celebrity.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.084
I've been asked to ask <i>you.</i>

07:41.151 --> 07:43.094
You want me to perform?

07:43.129 --> 07:45.931
It would earn us both
some much-needed goodwill

07:45.965 --> 07:47.065
down at 1PP.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.099
But what about ticket sales?

07:48.134 --> 07:50.302
Beckett and I would be happy to.

07:50.336 --> 07:51.303
Wait. What?

07:51.337 --> 07:52.971
On one condition.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.807
Even though I'm not a cop,
we compete for the trophy.

07:55.842 --> 07:56.934
Done.

07:57.944 --> 08:00.512
[Snickers]

08:00.546 --> 08:01.746
Oh, Castle.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.349
You really don't think you have
a shot at winning that trophy?

08:04.383 --> 08:06.985
Oh, I think I have
more than just a shot.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.954
Castle?

08:08.988 --> 08:10.922
Esposito: You do understand
that me and Ryan

08:10.957 --> 08:12.791
have been rehearsing for months?

08:12.825 --> 08:15.427
Well, what Beckett and I have
cannot be rehearsed.

08:15.461 --> 08:17.929
It's chemistry...
that intuitive bond,

08:17.964 --> 08:19.586
each person knowing
what the other's thinking.

08:19.606 --> 08:23.035
Castle. Can we talk for a second
over there?

08:23.069 --> 08:24.736
I knew she was gonna say that.

08:25.103 --> 08:26.443
Mm.

08:28.776 --> 08:31.143
Don't you think
you should have... asked me

08:31.177 --> 08:32.477
before signing me up for this?

08:32.511 --> 08:34.037
I thought you were on board.

08:34.057 --> 08:35.847
Uh, you were trash-talking Ryan
about it before.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.716
Yeah, that's when I thought
that there was no chance in hell

08:37.750 --> 08:38.984
that we would actually do it.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.852
Oh, relax.
We'll just do our routine.

08:40.886 --> 08:42.354
We don't <i>have</i> a routine.

08:42.388 --> 08:43.388
Come on!

08:43.423 --> 08:45.757
That thing in the shower?
That is delightful.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.225
No. That's not a routine.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.727
That's two naked people singing

08:48.761 --> 08:50.929
when there's no one around
to see or hear it.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.165
So we'll add some dance steps
and clothes.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.572
It's can't-miss.

08:54.832 --> 08:55.734
Ryan: Uh, guys?

08:55.768 --> 08:56.868
Give them a second, bro.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.670
They're rehearsing
their chemistry.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.706
[Sets down folders]
Ryan, you got something?

09:00.740 --> 09:04.176
Yeah... turns out that Richie
<i>was</i> at St. Simon's last night,

09:04.210 --> 09:06.183
and he was not alone.

09:07.461 --> 09:09.681
All right,
so, here is the parking lot

09:09.716 --> 09:11.183
behind St. Simon's.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.718
There's Richie.

09:14.128 --> 09:15.208
Now watch this.

09:16.456 --> 09:17.856
Esposito: It's a sports car...

09:17.890 --> 09:19.791
like the one seen
fleeing the crime scene.

09:19.826 --> 09:20.792
Yeah.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.237
And apparently,

09:22.257 --> 09:24.863
the driver had
some kind of beef with Pitbull.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.933
He shoves him in the car
and drives off.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.201
Can we make out the plate?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.036
Yeah. Already ran it.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.804
It is registered to this guy...

09:33.649 --> 09:35.107
Derek Bolt.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.716
Derek "lightning" Bolt,
the ex-NFL running back?

09:37.736 --> 09:41.079
What's a former mvp doing with
our ambulance-chasing Pitbull?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.148
Nothing good.
Check out the time stamp.

09:43.182 --> 09:45.917
11:00 p.m... just hours
before Richie was killed.

09:45.952 --> 09:49.554
Leaving enough time
for him to be tortured first.

09:53.478 --> 09:54.488
Ryan: There he is.

09:54.508 --> 09:55.694
Derek Bolt?

09:56.696 --> 09:58.330
We'd like a word.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.531
Hey!

10:07.373 --> 10:09.675
Aw, man! Get off me, man!

10:09.709 --> 10:11.743
Guess what, Bolt.
You just got benched.

10:21.856 --> 10:22.890
Finally!

10:22.924 --> 10:24.725
Someone gonna explain to me
what I'm doing in here?

10:24.759 --> 10:26.393
So, I guess
you running away from us

10:26.428 --> 10:28.195
was, what, exercise, Derek?

10:28.229 --> 10:29.963
Hey, I didn't know
you were cops.

10:29.998 --> 10:31.565
Look, I got some
financial troubles, all right?

10:31.599 --> 10:33.233
And you two looked like
collection agents,

10:33.268 --> 10:34.868
so my instincts kicked in.

10:34.903 --> 10:36.336
You can take lightning
out of the NFL,

10:36.371 --> 10:38.672
but you can't the NFL
out of lightning, you know.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.707
We know all about
your financial troubles, Derek.

10:40.742 --> 10:41.642
Yeah, we were just reading

10:41.676 --> 10:43.343
how you got hit
with a lawsuit last year

10:43.378 --> 10:45.379
after you busted up some guy
outside of a club.

10:45.413 --> 10:47.314
Hell yeah.
He dented the Bolt-mobile.

10:47.348 --> 10:49.416
Look, I lost my head, all right?

10:49.451 --> 10:50.984
But I've left him alone since.

10:51.019 --> 10:52.119
Lightning don't strike twice.

10:52.153 --> 10:55.355
Except you weren't so forgiving
of his lawyer, were you?

10:56.107 --> 10:57.391
Pitbull?

10:57.425 --> 10:58.358
What's he got to do
with any of this?

10:58.393 --> 11:00.894
He won a big settlement
against you last year

11:00.929 --> 11:02.663
and sent you into bankruptcy.

11:02.697 --> 11:04.164
So?

11:04.199 --> 11:06.133
So Pitbull's dead, Derek.

11:06.574 --> 11:08.535
- What?
- And the last time he was seen,

11:08.570 --> 11:12.239
he was being shoved into
your Bolt-mobile at 11:00 p.m.

11:12.273 --> 11:14.107
Hey, hey, that...
that ain't what it looks like.

11:14.142 --> 11:16.009
Really? Because right now,
it looks like revenge.

11:16.044 --> 11:16.877
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

11:16.911 --> 11:19.818
I-I did not kill Pitbull,
all right?

11:19.967 --> 11:22.382
Look, dawg did such a good job
against me in court,

11:22.417 --> 11:23.884
I wanted him on my team.

11:23.918 --> 11:25.452
So I went and hired his ass.

11:25.487 --> 11:27.354
Richie was working for <i>you?</i>

11:27.388 --> 11:30.390
Well, then why weren't you
on his client list?

11:30.425 --> 11:31.191
[Sighs]

11:31.226 --> 11:33.026
It's a paternity thing,
all right?

11:33.061 --> 11:34.695
My old lady's
just about had it with me,

11:34.729 --> 11:36.430
so he was handling this
off the books.

11:36.464 --> 11:38.065
Okay, but none of that

11:38.099 --> 11:40.634
explains your little joyride
last night.

11:40.668 --> 11:41.502
[Sighs]

11:41.536 --> 11:42.669
Me and Richie
were supposed to meet up

11:42.704 --> 11:45.405
with my baby mama and
her lawyer yesterday afternoon.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.890
Only, Richie never showed up,
and it made me look bad.

11:48.910 --> 11:51.844
So I invited him into my car
for a little conversation.

11:51.864 --> 11:53.113
He said he was sorry

11:53.147 --> 11:55.382
and that some urgent
business matter came up.

11:55.416 --> 11:56.483
What kind of business?

11:56.518 --> 11:58.485
Something about settling a debt.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.087
He told me he'd handle my thing,

12:00.121 --> 12:01.989
but he wanted me
to take him to some diner

12:02.023 --> 12:03.323
for a late-night meet.

12:03.358 --> 12:05.451
Said someone's life
depended on it.

12:06.628 --> 12:08.629
Guess maybe it was <i>his.</i>

12:09.486 --> 12:12.132
So, the manager
at the 24-hour gym

12:12.166 --> 12:14.401
confirms that Derek
<i>was</i> working out there

12:14.435 --> 12:16.236
during Richie's
time-of-death window,

12:16.271 --> 12:17.905
so he's not our killer.

12:17.939 --> 12:19.640
Which means Derek might have
been telling the truth

12:19.674 --> 12:21.174
about dropping Richie off
at that diner.

12:21.209 --> 12:22.042
Yeah, I'll head over there,

12:22.076 --> 12:23.343
see if the waitstaff
remembers Richie

12:23.378 --> 12:24.411
talking with anyone last night.

12:24.445 --> 12:26.980
It still doesn't explain
where he was during the day,

12:27.015 --> 12:29.182
why he missed work or blew off
that client meeting.

12:29.217 --> 12:31.552
I may know someone we can ask.

12:33.406 --> 12:35.489
Espo, what happened?

12:35.523 --> 12:37.791
I twisted my knee
when I was tackling lightning.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.826
Wh... are you gonna be okay?

12:39.861 --> 12:41.862
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I just, uh... I just tweaked it.

12:41.896 --> 12:42.996
It's probably a sprain.

12:43.031 --> 12:44.231
Oh, that's too bad.

12:44.265 --> 12:47.023
I was looking forward to beating
you in the talent competition.

12:47.043 --> 12:50.103
Oh. You think
this is gonna take me out?

12:50.138 --> 12:51.672
Yes. Yes, I do.

12:51.706 --> 12:54.107
No. It's still on.

12:54.142 --> 12:55.642
Uh, ge... I-I-I mean, how?

12:55.677 --> 12:57.144
Espo, you can barely walk.

12:57.178 --> 12:58.812
Yeah, and even on one leg,

12:58.846 --> 13:01.048
Ryan and I are still
gonna whip your sorry asses.

13:01.082 --> 13:02.816
In fact, how about a wager?

13:02.850 --> 13:05.352
Um, uh, partner, you know,
maybe w-we should discuss...

13:05.386 --> 13:06.353
Unh-unh.

13:06.387 --> 13:09.556
If we win, then you will
dedicate your next book

13:09.591 --> 13:10.958
to "Esposito and Ryan,

13:10.992 --> 13:13.460
two guys
who are funnier, handsomer,

13:13.494 --> 13:15.162
and better than me
in every way."

13:15.196 --> 13:17.531
[Laughs]

13:17.565 --> 13:18.990
Oh, you're serious.

13:19.312 --> 13:21.401
And if Beckett and I win?

13:21.436 --> 13:23.236
Well, then Ryan and I

13:23.271 --> 13:25.572
will call you "King Castle"
for a month.

13:25.607 --> 13:26.515
Hey, Javi...

13:26.535 --> 13:28.208
I mean... [Sighs]

13:28.242 --> 13:29.710
- What do you say?
- Yeah, you know what?

13:29.744 --> 13:30.777
I think Ryan's right.

13:30.812 --> 13:33.814
I mean, we don't need
to make a bet out of this.

13:33.848 --> 13:35.749
Why? Because you're chicken?

13:35.783 --> 13:38.124
No. Because I am a grown-up.

13:38.144 --> 13:39.853
Yeah... a grown-up chicken.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.189
[Clucking]

13:42.223 --> 13:46.059
I will also accept
"your royal highness."

13:46.094 --> 13:47.694
You're on, gimpy.

13:47.729 --> 13:49.496
Ooh. That's clever.

13:49.530 --> 13:51.565
I work with what you give me.

13:51.599 --> 13:52.666
I'm gonna take you down.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.001
With what... your crutches?

13:54.035 --> 13:55.035
Can we get back to the dead guy?

13:55.069 --> 13:56.169
You said that you found someone

13:56.204 --> 13:58.672
who could tell us why
Richie missed work yesterday.

13:58.692 --> 14:00.741
Yes. I pulled his phone
and financials.

14:00.775 --> 14:03.076
There were no charges
on his credit card yesterday,

14:03.111 --> 14:04.444
but he made a call...

14:04.479 --> 14:06.104
the only call
he made from his cell all day.

14:06.124 --> 14:06.899
To whom?

14:06.919 --> 14:08.264
Someone he hasn't called
in years...

14:08.284 --> 14:10.274
his ex-wife, Elise Resner.

14:10.882 --> 14:13.854
He said he was in trouble
and needed my help.

14:13.888 --> 14:15.961
What kind of trouble, exactly?

14:15.981 --> 14:17.958
Detective,
you have to understand...

14:17.992 --> 14:20.460
I hadn't spoken to him in years.

14:20.495 --> 14:23.407
And then he just calls
out of the blue.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.640
You never asked.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.105
I didn't want to know.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.854
After everything
that happened between us,

14:27.874 --> 14:29.952
I knew
I couldn't get involved again.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.872
What happened
between the two of you?

14:31.906 --> 14:33.707
We were
at the same corporate firm.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.009
It's how we met.

14:35.043 --> 14:36.710

14:36.745 --> 14:39.213
How did he end up

He was a superstar...

14:41.516 --> 14:43.550

14:43.585 --> 14:45.686
But the pressure got to be
too much for him.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.688
About five years back,
he self-destructed...

14:47.722 --> 14:49.323

14:49.357 --> 14:53.193
Losing all of his cases,
uh, his job...

[Knock on door]

14:57.843 --> 15:00.126
Hey, Beckett,
we got a situation.

15:01.454 --> 15:04.204
[Sighs] I came back from lunch
to find the door half-open,

15:04.239 --> 15:05.572
the lock was broken,

15:05.607 --> 15:07.374
and... well, you can...
you can see the rest.

15:07.409 --> 15:09.243
Any idea what they were
looking for?

15:09.277 --> 15:10.611
I'm still
sorting through the mess.

15:10.645 --> 15:12.579
But Richie's computer is gone,

15:12.614 --> 15:14.181
and there's something else.

15:14.215 --> 15:16.216
All of his case files
are missing.

15:16.251 --> 15:18.218
Why would anyone want
Richie's files?

15:18.253 --> 15:20.287
This must have something to do
with one of his cases...

15:20.322 --> 15:22.256
client, maybe a witness...

15:22.290 --> 15:24.758
Someone or something
that he was looking into,

15:24.793 --> 15:26.060
something he was hiding
even from <i>you.</i>

15:26.911 --> 15:28.595
Okay,
let's canvass the building,

15:28.630 --> 15:30.064
see if anyone else
saw something.

Do you remember that meeting

15:39.541 --> 15:41.875
that Richie said he had
in a diner last night?

15:41.910 --> 15:42.743
Yeah.

15:42.777 --> 15:45.145
Well, a waitress
saw the whole thing.

15:45.180 --> 15:46.180
A lot more like a fight.

15:46.214 --> 15:48.449
Richie got in a shouting match
with another guy.

15:48.483 --> 15:49.717
You get a description?

that Richie and the Hammer

16:05.133 --> 16:06.133
would be fighting?

16:06.167 --> 16:08.268
They were always stealing
clients from each other.

16:08.303 --> 16:09.821
Only, Richie was better at it.

16:09.841 --> 16:12.740
It got to where Hammer was so
sick of losing business to him

16:12.774 --> 16:14.174
that he...

16:14.209 --> 16:17.002
He promised to put an end to it.

16:18.342 --> 16:20.147
One way or another.

16:20.181 --> 16:21.515
Where can we find him?

16:21.549 --> 16:23.517

Call me, friend.

16:23.551 --> 16:25.185
Whatever happened to you
is <i>nothing</i>

16:25.220 --> 16:27.384
compared to what I'm gonna do
to the other guy.

16:27.989 --> 16:29.790
Mr. Archie Bronstein?

16:29.824 --> 16:31.125
The Savannah Hammer.

16:31.159 --> 16:33.160
No case too small,
no settlement too big.

16:33.194 --> 16:34.628
Now, what can I help you with?

16:34.662 --> 16:37.264
Slip-and-fall? Work injury?
Medical malpractice?

16:37.298 --> 16:39.833
We're here about the murder
of Richie the Pitbull.

16:42.570 --> 16:44.304
Sure, I was at that diner
last night.

16:44.339 --> 16:46.273
This urgent meeting
that the two of you had...

16:46.307 --> 16:48.542
- what was it about?
- I'd hardly call it a meeting.

16:48.576 --> 16:49.954
I went in to get some pecan pie,

16:49.974 --> 16:51.412
and I saw him sitting there.

16:51.446 --> 16:53.113
So the meeting wasn't planned?

16:53.148 --> 16:55.082
Well, maybe he was planning
on meeting someone else,

16:55.116 --> 16:56.968
but when I saw him
in that booth, he was alone,

16:56.988 --> 16:58.752
- and we got into it.
- About what?

16:58.787 --> 17:00.521
The usual...
I caught him here last night

17:00.555 --> 17:03.190
trying to poach
one of my clients.

17:03.225 --> 17:05.192
We had words here
and then again at the diner.

17:05.227 --> 17:07.161
So, Richie was paranoid
he was being followed,

17:07.194 --> 17:09.163
disappears all day,
says he's in trouble,

17:09.196 --> 17:10.631
then comes here
to poach a client?

17:10.665 --> 17:12.866
Mr. Bronstein,
was there a specific reason

17:12.901 --> 17:14.935
that he was interested
in <i>this</i> client?

17:14.970 --> 17:17.104
He smelled an easy win.

17:17.137 --> 17:21.141
Poor girl gets three pieces
of flying metal in her heart

17:21.175 --> 17:23.176
when a scrap truck
plows into her car.

17:23.211 --> 17:25.179
Now, that is
a slam-dunk settlement.

17:25.213 --> 17:28.616
So you bet when I saw Richie
at that diner, we got loud.

17:28.650 --> 17:30.451
So the waitress told us
to take it outside,

17:30.485 --> 17:33.220
where I advised him
to steer clear of my clients.

17:33.898 --> 17:35.289
And what time was that?

17:35.323 --> 17:37.124
11:45 maybe.

17:37.158 --> 17:39.226
Look, I didn't kill him.

17:39.261 --> 17:41.295
I didn't steal those files.

17:41.329 --> 17:43.063
But it might be related

17:43.098 --> 17:45.933
to his...
extracurricular activities.

17:46.901 --> 17:48.135
Uh, what's that mean?

17:48.169 --> 17:50.671
Richie liked to come off like
he was better than all of us,

17:50.705 --> 17:52.139
with his Harvard degree

17:52.173 --> 17:54.742
and his "champion
of the little guy" act,

17:54.776 --> 17:57.144
but trust me...
he was into some things.

17:57.178 --> 17:58.512
What kind of things?

17:58.546 --> 18:00.214
Bad things.

18:00.248 --> 18:01.582
Word on the street was,

18:01.616 --> 18:04.051
there was nothing
he wouldn't do for a price.

18:04.532 --> 18:06.954
And I mean nothing.

18:07.622 --> 18:09.390
[Camera shutter clicks] Hey.

18:09.424 --> 18:11.392
So, it looks like
Hammer's not our killer.

18:11.426 --> 18:13.060
Apparently,
after he left the diner,

18:13.094 --> 18:16.263
he spent the rest of the night
"nailing" one of his clients.

18:16.298 --> 18:17.131
Anything else turn up missing

18:17.165 --> 18:18.866
besides the files
and the computer?

18:18.900 --> 18:20.901
No, not so far.

18:20.935 --> 18:22.369
This is what I don't get...

18:22.404 --> 18:24.238
if all they wanted was files,

18:24.272 --> 18:25.839
why'd they turn this place
upside down?

18:25.874 --> 18:27.374
Must have been looking
for something else.

18:27.409 --> 18:28.175
Hmm.

18:28.209 --> 18:31.211
Detectives,
you need to see this.

18:34.813 --> 18:37.618
We found a false panel
in the wall. Take a look.

18:52.805 --> 18:54.034

18:54.069 --> 18:56.403
Looks like somebody was planning
an abduction.

18:56.962 --> 19:00.274
He might have went past
the planning phase.

19:02.344 --> 19:05.045

19:05.080 --> 19:06.280
And they're still glowing.

19:06.314 --> 19:07.815
Which means
he must have used this bag

19:07.849 --> 19:09.216
within the last two days.

19:09.250 --> 19:09.950
Yeah.

But for what?

19:13.600 --> 19:15.862
Well, I just got off with CSU...

19:15.882 --> 19:19.816
That rag tested positive
for chloroform.

19:20.151 --> 19:22.155
So he must have used it
to knock someone out.

19:22.175 --> 19:24.484

in the past two days,

19:35.690 --> 19:37.423
see if I can link any of them
to Richie's cases.

19:37.457 --> 19:39.430
Yeah, and look into
missing-persons reports.

19:39.450 --> 19:41.043

Have Tory run this
through the database,

19:58.645 --> 19:59.645
see if she can find anything.

19:59.679 --> 20:01.814
And let's see if she can trace
where Richie was

20:01.848 --> 20:03.582
when he made that phone call
to his ex.

20:03.616 --> 20:05.717
You think any of this is connected
to that girl at the hospital?

20:05.752 --> 20:07.553
No, that was
a straight-up car accident...

20:07.587 --> 20:08.935
nothing that speaks
to any of this.

20:08.955 --> 20:11.390
But someone out there has to
know what Richie was up to.

20:11.424 --> 20:14.459
Well, maybe we should ask
Mr. Sampson.

20:14.494 --> 20:15.561
Who's Mr. Sampson?

20:15.595 --> 20:19.064
I don't know, but these are
his night-vision goggles.

20:23.503 --> 20:24.770
Yeah. They're mine.

20:24.804 --> 20:27.072
How did you know the victim,
Mr. Sampson?

20:27.106 --> 20:29.760
Uh, I did work for Richie
here and there.

ago, asking to borrow them.

20:35.515 --> 20:36.782
Did he say
what he needed them for?

20:36.816 --> 20:39.117
Sometimes he would slip me
some extra cash

20:39.152 --> 20:41.520
not to ask questions.

20:41.554 --> 20:43.188
Anything else
you helped him with?

20:43.223 --> 20:45.657
Yeah... he had some questions
about alarm schematics.

20:45.692 --> 20:47.374
Uh, like...

Like these?

20:50.023 --> 20:51.046
Yeah.

20:51.066 --> 20:52.798
What about chloroform,
Mr. Sampson?

20:52.832 --> 20:54.533
Did you give him that, too?

20:54.567 --> 20:56.335
No. He had chloroform?

20:56.369 --> 20:57.936
Yeah. Why? What's wrong?

20:57.971 --> 20:59.471
When I gave him the goggles,

20:59.505 --> 21:01.607
I asked if there was
anything else he needed.

21:01.641 --> 21:02.875
He said something.

21:02.909 --> 21:04.643
I thought he was joking.

21:04.677 --> 21:06.011
What did he say?

21:06.045 --> 21:08.146
He asked me...

21:08.181 --> 21:10.415
"What's the best way
to get rid of a body?"

21:13.386 --> 21:15.387

21:18.658 --> 21:19.658

21:19.692 --> 21:21.960
Maybe that's what he meant
by "settling a debt."

21:21.995 --> 21:23.896
But what was the debt,
whom did he kill,

21:23.930 --> 21:25.330
and how did it cost him
his life?

24:38.792 --> 24:41.126
on Richie's pants
from a tussilago flower?

24:41.161 --> 24:43.762
Check out this little
yellow patch right here

24:43.797 --> 24:45.359
about ankle high.

24:46.103 --> 24:48.066
- Beckett.
- Yeah.

24:53.987 --> 24:56.456
Richie <i>did</i> bury someone
out here.

24:59.422 --> 25:02.147
Look, about the routine...

25:02.182 --> 25:03.816
I know you're worried, but...

25:03.850 --> 25:06.418
It's okay, Castle.
It doesn't matter what we do.

25:06.452 --> 25:07.986
Hey, that's the spirit!

25:08.021 --> 25:09.454
It's gonna be a disaster.

25:09.489 --> 25:11.457
That's not the spirit.

25:11.477 --> 25:14.760
I'm probably gonna trip,
my dress is gonna split,

25:14.794 --> 25:16.161
video's gonna go viral.

25:16.196 --> 25:17.796
Okay, now you're
just sounding paranoid.

25:17.831 --> 25:19.131
Where is this coming from?

25:19.165 --> 25:21.300
I'm just saying, Castle,
it could happen.

25:21.334 --> 25:22.935
I mean, there's a reason
why Captain Gates

25:22.969 --> 25:25.170
doesn't get up on the stage
and have fun.

25:25.205 --> 25:26.238
I just always assumed

25:26.272 --> 25:28.774
it was because she was
genetically incapable of it.

25:28.808 --> 25:30.342
You want me to cancel?

25:30.376 --> 25:31.376
No! No.

25:31.411 --> 25:34.146
That would just make me
lose face in another way.

25:34.180 --> 25:35.013
[Thud]

25:35.581 --> 25:37.021
I just hit something.

25:37.383 --> 25:38.917
[Thud] [Grunts]

25:40.687 --> 25:42.493
That's a body bag.

25:48.954 --> 25:50.865
[Grunts]

25:56.202 --> 25:57.236
[Shotgun cocks]

25:59.406 --> 26:02.533
Man: Put the bag down
and step away from the body.

26:03.948 --> 26:07.246
I think we may just have
dug our own graves.

26:12.987 --> 26:14.420
I don't hear anything.

26:14.455 --> 26:15.955
Mm. Me neither.

26:15.990 --> 26:17.323
What's he doing?

26:22.684 --> 26:24.130
He's gone.

26:24.164 --> 26:25.231
What?

26:25.266 --> 26:26.399
[Grunts]

26:27.350 --> 26:28.959
So's the body!
He stole the body.

26:28.979 --> 26:30.063
Why would anyone steal a body?

26:30.104 --> 26:31.538
He must be
connected to this somehow.

26:31.572 --> 26:32.984
Maybe he and Richie
are partners.

26:33.004 --> 26:33.940
Maybe they killed that person
together.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.723
Well, there'll be time
for questions later.

26:35.743 --> 26:37.377
Right now,
we just have to find a way

26:37.411 --> 26:39.279
to saw through these zip ties
before he gets back.

26:39.313 --> 26:41.949
Yes, well, he took our keys
and our phones, so...

26:41.969 --> 26:43.850
Oh! Wait a minute.

26:43.884 --> 26:45.566
As part of my P.I. training,
I saw a video

26:45.586 --> 26:47.220
on how to break
these zip-tie cuffs.

26:47.255 --> 26:48.855
All you have to do
is just hit them

26:48.890 --> 26:51.057
as hard as you can
against your ass!

26:51.092 --> 26:52.192
Ow.

26:52.226 --> 26:53.527
It said
it might take a few tries.

26:53.561 --> 26:55.028
Okay.
[Grunts]

26:56.230 --> 26:58.165
[Grunts]

26:58.185 --> 27:00.133
[Chuckles]

27:00.861 --> 27:02.102
Ow!

27:02.136 --> 27:04.037
[Grunting]

27:04.071 --> 27:05.097
- It's not working.
- No.

27:05.117 --> 27:05.906
But on the bright side, I think

27:05.940 --> 27:08.041
we came up with a new move
for our dance routine.

27:09.433 --> 27:11.044
[Groans] Too soon?
Yeah.

27:11.078 --> 27:12.212
[Snap] Aah!

27:12.246 --> 27:13.764
- Yes! [Laughs]
- Oh!

27:15.883 --> 27:17.050
[Snap] - Oh!

27:17.084 --> 27:18.585
Sweet.

27:18.619 --> 27:20.187
- He stole the body?
- Yeah.

27:20.221 --> 27:23.089
Send a team up to those woods
to comb for trace evidence

27:23.124 --> 27:25.640
and check these zip ties
for DNA.

27:25.660 --> 27:26.593
Did you get a look at this guy?

27:26.627 --> 27:28.195
He was masked,
came up behind us,

27:28.229 --> 27:30.197
kept us facing away from him
the whole time.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.131
Anything from missing persons?

27:31.165 --> 27:33.099
Anyone in Richie's life
that disappeared?

27:33.134 --> 27:36.102
Well, we've looked into
every disappearance and break-in

27:36.137 --> 27:37.637
in the tri-state area.

27:37.672 --> 27:39.206
So far, no connection
to any one of them and Richie.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.375
And I, uh, checked
with known associates, clients,

27:42.410 --> 27:43.715
people he was suing.

27:43.735 --> 27:44.778
They're all accounted for.

27:44.812 --> 27:47.480
Yeah. Well, <i>somebody</i> was in
that bag, so let's dig deeper.

27:47.515 --> 27:48.315
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

27:48.349 --> 27:52.285
Oh. And, uh,
you can lose the limp.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.420
We saw you rehearsing.

27:53.454 --> 27:57.290
If I might add, it's no
"I've had the crime of my life."

27:57.325 --> 27:58.725
Well...

27:58.759 --> 28:00.794
It's still good enough
to take the both of you down.

28:00.828 --> 28:02.295
[Sighs] Come on, guys.

28:02.330 --> 28:03.964
This isn't really
about the competition.

28:03.998 --> 28:06.299
It's about doing our best
for a good cause, right?

28:06.334 --> 28:08.535
Together:
It's about the competition.

28:16.644 --> 28:18.044
[Giggles]

28:18.879 --> 28:21.414
Well! Bravo! And brava!

28:21.449 --> 28:23.149
Wonderful.
Darlings, just wonderful.

28:23.184 --> 28:23.850
Thank you.

28:23.884 --> 28:25.619
And you were worried. See?

28:25.653 --> 28:26.653
It's elegant, dignified,

28:26.687 --> 28:29.256
and, above all,
a trophy-winning performance.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.257
Am I right, mother?

28:30.291 --> 28:31.491
Well, it <i>will</i> be
when I'm done with it.

28:31.525 --> 28:33.627
I'm gonna just need to tweak
a few little things. Okay.

28:33.661 --> 28:35.862
And I do wish
you would go for that split.

28:35.896 --> 28:38.298
Well, I... okay. Well, I will
leave you to convince ginger.

28:38.332 --> 28:39.099
I will be right back.

28:39.133 --> 28:40.333
Wait. Where...
w-where are you going?

28:40.368 --> 28:41.401
I'm gonna call Esposito.

28:41.435 --> 28:43.370
I think it's time
we raise the stakes on that bet.

28:43.404 --> 28:45.138
What? Castle...

28:45.172 --> 28:46.606
[Sighs]

28:46.641 --> 28:49.843
Oh, darling,
don't you worry about him.

28:49.877 --> 28:51.778
Do not worry about that trophy,

28:51.812 --> 28:53.380
because the only thing
that anybody

28:53.414 --> 28:56.149
is going to remember
from the final performance

28:56.183 --> 28:58.184
is that you sound like an angel.

28:58.219 --> 29:00.854
Except, Martha, I <i>won't.</i>

29:00.888 --> 29:03.290
[Laughing] Well, of course
you will. You just did.

29:03.324 --> 29:07.127
No, Martha. That's because
it was just you and Rick.

29:07.161 --> 29:09.663
We weren't in public
in front of strangers.

29:09.697 --> 29:11.498
Oh, no. Stage fright.

29:11.532 --> 29:14.167
Well, it's... it's... it's
more like <i>song</i> fright. Mm-hmm.

29:14.201 --> 29:15.702
I mean, my heart
just starts palpitating

29:15.736 --> 29:17.203
and I start sweating
and my throat just chokes up.

29:17.238 --> 29:18.338
I know. I know. I know.

29:18.372 --> 29:20.340
It's classic, and it's awful.

29:20.374 --> 29:21.908
And why in the world

29:21.942 --> 29:24.501
would Richard
sign you up for this?

29:26.280 --> 29:27.480
He doesn't know.

29:27.515 --> 29:28.815
Oh, honey.

29:28.849 --> 29:30.216
You have to tell him!

29:30.251 --> 29:32.319
Oh, I-I don't want
to let him down.

29:32.353 --> 29:33.353
[Scoffs]
He wants this so badly.

29:33.387 --> 29:34.654
I want to give it to him.

29:34.689 --> 29:37.357
But I just...
I don't know that I can.

29:37.391 --> 29:39.326
Ohh.

29:40.795 --> 29:42.429
I cannot wait to see
the looks on their faces

29:42.463 --> 29:43.997
when they get a load
of our routine.

29:44.031 --> 29:46.166
Yeah, I can imagine it
v-vividly.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.834
Oh, trust me... it'll be great.

29:47.868 --> 29:49.336
If it's gonna be so great,

29:49.370 --> 29:52.439
then why don't we
up the bet again?

29:52.473 --> 29:54.541
Well, Esposito,
what did you have in mind?

29:54.575 --> 29:56.409
Sorry, fellas. All bets are off.

29:56.444 --> 29:58.411
I just heard from 1PP.

29:58.446 --> 30:01.848
Kimmel rearranged his schedule,
and he's back in.

30:01.882 --> 30:03.216
Oh... so, unfortunately,

30:03.250 --> 30:05.385
we will not be needing
your services, Mr. Castle.

30:05.419 --> 30:06.186
Really?

30:06.220 --> 30:07.721
But we rehearsed and everything.

30:07.755 --> 30:09.322
Out of my hands.

30:11.425 --> 30:12.726
This isn't over.

30:12.760 --> 30:13.760
Well...

30:13.794 --> 30:15.428
- Hey, guys. We got him.
- Who?

30:15.463 --> 30:17.464
That guy who jacked you
for that body in the woods.

30:17.498 --> 30:18.732
When CSU went up there,

30:18.766 --> 30:20.200
they noticed
something in the trees...

30:20.234 --> 30:22.068
cameras
triggered by motion sensors

30:22.103 --> 30:23.937
to carry out wildlife census.

30:23.971 --> 30:26.272
Guess what kind of wildlife
we found.

30:28.342 --> 30:29.776
Mike Sampson.

30:29.810 --> 30:31.111
Richie's P.I.

30:31.145 --> 30:33.747
[Siren wails]

30:34.749 --> 30:36.216
[Tires screech]

30:37.451 --> 30:38.485
NYPD!

30:38.519 --> 30:40.220
Let me see your hands... now!

30:40.254 --> 30:41.388
[Guns cock]

30:42.325 --> 30:44.624
Where is it, Mike?
Where's the body?

30:44.658 --> 30:46.226
What's going on?
What are you talking about?

30:46.260 --> 30:47.727
Search his place.

30:47.762 --> 30:49.329
Espo, pop the trunk.

30:49.363 --> 30:50.912
Hands on the car.

30:53.834 --> 30:54.901
All right.

30:56.170 --> 30:57.137
It's here.

30:57.171 --> 30:58.944
Who's in the bag, Mike?

31:09.550 --> 31:11.084
What the...

31:18.188 --> 31:21.604
Sampson's not talking...
about Richie <i>or</i> the dummy.

31:21.624 --> 31:22.646
I don't get it.

31:22.666 --> 31:24.210
Why would Richie
bury a crash-test dummy

31:24.230 --> 31:26.410
in the middle of nowhere,
and why would Sampson steal it?

31:26.430 --> 31:29.013
I don't know, but he probably
told us that story

31:29.033 --> 31:30.199
about Richie dumping a body

31:30.233 --> 31:32.101
so that we could lead him
straight to it.

31:32.135 --> 31:33.960
Ryan: Well, it turns out
that dummy's not the only thing

31:33.980 --> 31:35.275
that Sampson stole.

31:35.295 --> 31:37.540
Unis found
Richie's missing client files

31:37.574 --> 31:39.608
in his apartment, shredded.

31:39.643 --> 31:42.354
This must have something to do
with one of Richie's cases.

31:42.374 --> 31:43.947
Yeah, but which one?

31:43.967 --> 31:46.048
You know, if Sampson won't talk,

31:46.083 --> 31:47.883
then maybe the dummy will.

31:47.918 --> 31:50.753
You do know I'm a doctor,
not a puppeteer?

31:50.787 --> 31:53.723
Yes. And as a doctor, I was
hoping that you could tell us

31:53.757 --> 31:56.258
what's so special
about this dummy.

31:56.293 --> 31:58.794
I'll tell you
what's special about it.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.830
This dummy has been murdered.

32:00.864 --> 32:01.931
Murdered?

32:01.965 --> 32:03.432
See the holes in his chest?

32:03.467 --> 32:04.767
They look like
little bullet holes.

32:04.801 --> 32:06.466
That's basically what they are.

32:06.486 --> 32:09.105
As far as I can tell, they were
made by small metal pieces

32:09.139 --> 32:10.806
projected
with significant force.

32:10.841 --> 32:11.807
What would explain that?

32:11.842 --> 32:13.075
It's hard to say.

32:13.110 --> 32:14.977
Lots of people
use these dummies...

32:15.011 --> 32:17.446
car companies,
the airline industry,

32:17.481 --> 32:18.979
the military.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.916
So someone could have been
testing the effects

32:20.951 --> 32:22.785
of an I.E.D. or a new firearm.

32:22.819 --> 32:25.287
I don't think it's a firearm.

32:26.073 --> 32:27.513
Three holes...

32:27.533 --> 32:29.925
Three bits of flying metal
around the heart.

32:30.454 --> 32:32.385
Where have we heard that before?

32:32.896 --> 32:35.431
Hammer's client...
the one Pitbull tried to poach.

32:37.125 --> 32:40.269
Last thing I remember
was that salvage truck

32:40.303 --> 32:41.971
hitting the median before me.

32:42.005 --> 32:44.006
That's when
the metal started to fly.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.379
The paramedic said I was lucky,
that I almost died.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.779
Um, Jody,
do you remember this guy?

32:49.813 --> 32:51.122
Yeah... the Pitbull.

32:51.142 --> 32:54.183
He wanted to represent me,
but I already had a lawyer.

32:54.217 --> 32:56.886
But then he wouldn't stop
asking about the accident,

32:56.920 --> 32:59.397
like he didn't believe
what happened.

32:59.417 --> 33:01.524
Jody, what kind of car
were you driving?

33:01.558 --> 33:04.042
I'm not sure. It was a rental.

33:04.062 --> 33:06.061
Why does everyone
keep asking that?

33:06.096 --> 33:07.062
Who's been asking?

33:07.097 --> 33:10.259
The Pitbull and the lady
who was here yesterday.

33:10.279 --> 33:11.351
What lady?

33:11.371 --> 33:13.929
She said she was
from my insurance company.

33:13.937 --> 33:15.838
When I woke up,
she was looking at my chart.

33:15.873 --> 33:17.306
She asked me about my injuries

33:17.341 --> 33:19.475
and wanted to know
all about the car.

33:19.510 --> 33:20.977
That doesn't make any sense.

33:21.011 --> 33:22.478
The insurance company
would have that information

33:22.513 --> 33:23.613
from the accident report.

33:23.647 --> 33:26.179
Do you think you could
describe her to a sketch artist?

33:26.477 --> 33:27.438
Yeah.

33:27.458 --> 33:28.964
Okay. And, um, one more thing.

33:28.984 --> 33:31.521
What was the name
of the car-rental company?

33:31.555 --> 33:32.655
According to the rental firm,

33:32.689 --> 33:34.824
Jody was driving
a Modesto Sedan.

33:34.858 --> 33:37.527
Now, I couldn't find any safety
recalls to explain her injuries,

33:37.561 --> 33:39.996
but on a hunch,
I checked the cities and dates

33:40.030 --> 33:41.531
on that slip of paper
that we found.

33:41.565 --> 33:43.366
Turns out that each one

33:43.400 --> 33:45.268
corresponded
to a Modesto car accident

33:45.302 --> 33:47.470
where the driver suffered
puncture wounds to the chest.

33:47.504 --> 33:49.605
Just like Jody Evans
and that crash-test dummy.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.507
Yeah, but in each case,
the wounds

33:51.542 --> 33:53.543
were attributed to something
outside the vehicle...

33:53.577 --> 33:55.478
road debris, even gunshots.

33:55.512 --> 33:57.713
Given the velocity
of the shrapnel,

33:57.748 --> 34:00.550
this must be related
to a defect in the airbags.

34:00.584 --> 34:02.385
And judging by the holes
in that dummy,

34:02.419 --> 34:04.020
Modesto was aware of that defect

34:04.054 --> 34:06.055
and chose
to sweep it under the rug.

34:06.089 --> 34:07.390
Richie was onto a cover-up.

34:07.424 --> 34:08.824
Yeah, one that he might have
been a part of.

34:08.859 --> 34:10.460
I looked into
that big-time law firm

34:10.494 --> 34:12.295
where Richie used to work
five years ago

34:12.329 --> 34:13.487
before he became the Pitbull.

34:13.507 --> 34:15.498
Guess who
their biggest client was.

34:15.532 --> 34:16.399
Modesto Motors.

34:16.433 --> 34:18.717
Yeah. And Richie
handled their account.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.138
You know, about five years,
Modesto was nearly bankrupt.

34:22.172 --> 34:26.007
So rather than spend millions
of dollars to fix the problem,

34:26.043 --> 34:28.177
they decided
that the cost of recall

34:28.212 --> 34:30.346
outweighed the potential cost
to human life.

34:30.380 --> 34:32.348
Looks like Richie's conscience
couldn't take it.

34:32.382 --> 34:34.050
That problem he had
with drinking and drugs

34:34.083 --> 34:36.052
started just a few months
after that first accident.

34:36.085 --> 34:38.321
That debt Richie told Derek
he was settling...

34:38.355 --> 34:39.764
it was a karmic one.

34:39.784 --> 34:42.525
He wanted to make it right,
expose the cover-up.

34:42.559 --> 34:44.694
He needed to prove that Modesto
knew about the defect

34:44.728 --> 34:46.395
even before
people started dying.

34:46.429 --> 34:49.431
That crash-test dummy...
that was his smoking gun.

34:49.466 --> 34:51.601
Which explains
the break-in equipment.

34:51.635 --> 34:53.536
He needed it
to steal the dummy from Modesto.

34:53.570 --> 34:55.605
No wonder Richie was paranoid

34:55.639 --> 34:57.792
and buried that dummy
in the woods.

34:57.812 --> 34:59.709
Guys, if the truth
about the defect came out,

34:59.743 --> 35:01.344
then Modesto would be liable

35:01.378 --> 35:03.513
for hundreds of millions
of dollars in damages.

35:03.547 --> 35:05.581
He knew they'd stop at nothing
to get it back.

35:05.616 --> 35:07.083
Okay, this is
a hell of a theory,

35:07.117 --> 35:10.019
but with Richie dead,
the files all destroyed,

35:10.053 --> 35:11.754
and with
absolutely no connection

35:11.788 --> 35:13.356
between the dummy and Modesto,

35:13.390 --> 35:14.757
it's just that... it's a theory.

35:14.791 --> 35:16.225
Oh, it's more than a theory.

35:16.260 --> 35:17.760
We just got that sketch back
from Jody

35:17.794 --> 35:19.762
of the woman who visited her

35:19.796 --> 35:21.564
claiming to be
from an insurance company.

35:21.598 --> 35:23.070
Look familiar?

35:23.600 --> 35:25.130
Esposito: Richie's ex.

35:25.515 --> 35:27.303
What the hell does she
have to do with any of this?

35:27.337 --> 35:29.405
She was recently poached
from the law firm

35:29.439 --> 35:31.240
that she and Richie worked at.

35:31.275 --> 35:33.142
She's now lead counsel
for Modesto.

35:33.176 --> 35:34.877
Richie was a threat.

35:34.912 --> 35:36.734
He knew where the bodies
were buried.

35:36.754 --> 35:39.949
So his ex-wife decided
to add him to the pile.

35:43.454 --> 35:45.802
I'm not sure why I'm here.
I've told you everything I know.

35:45.822 --> 35:46.993
No. Not everything.

35:47.013 --> 35:48.757
You didn't tell us
that you were lead counsel

35:48.791 --> 35:50.008
for Modesto Motors,

35:50.028 --> 35:52.041
and you didn't tell us
about the airbags.

35:52.061 --> 35:53.762
You know,
those airbags with the habit

35:53.796 --> 35:57.167
of putting holes in people,
like Jody Evans.

35:57.187 --> 35:57.966
Excuse me?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.869
Ms. Resner, why did Richie
really call you the other day?

36:00.903 --> 36:02.971
Was it to give you
a little heads-up?

36:03.005 --> 36:04.706
You know... for old times' sake?

36:04.740 --> 36:06.908
Because that defect
he helped cover up back then,

36:06.942 --> 36:08.076
you were in on that, too.

36:08.110 --> 36:09.444
He was going public with it,

36:09.478 --> 36:11.212
and he didn't want you
to be blindsided.

36:11.247 --> 36:12.981
But you couldn't
let that happen...

36:13.015 --> 36:15.383
not to Modesto
and certainly not to <i>you.</i>

36:15.417 --> 36:17.853
So you had him silenced.

36:18.461 --> 36:20.563
You think
I killed my ex-husband?

36:20.583 --> 36:24.459
Detective, I had nothing
to do with Richie's death.

36:24.493 --> 36:28.730
And, by the way, there is
no defect or cover-up.

36:28.764 --> 36:29.798
Richie knew otherwise.

36:29.832 --> 36:31.966
In fact, he committed a break-in
just to prove it.

36:32.001 --> 36:34.002
We found
that a silent alarm was tripped

36:34.036 --> 36:36.671
at a Modesto Motors storage
facility three nights ago.

36:36.705 --> 36:38.106
But when police responded,

36:38.140 --> 36:40.475
they were told
it was set off by mistake.

36:40.509 --> 36:42.977
Yet an ambulance
was called there that night

36:43.012 --> 36:45.747
to treat a guard
for chloroform inhalation.

36:46.523 --> 36:48.183
I'm not familiar
with that incident.

36:48.217 --> 36:50.270
Well, are you familiar
with <i>this?</i>

36:51.524 --> 36:53.087
It's evidence of your cover-up.

36:53.122 --> 36:56.157
If this dummy
was illegally obtained

36:56.192 --> 36:57.959
from a Modesto storage facility,

36:57.993 --> 36:59.761
then it is the property
of Modesto,

36:59.795 --> 37:01.963
- and we'd like it back.
- I'm sure you would,

37:01.997 --> 37:04.766

it could cost your company

37:04.800 --> 37:06.968
hundreds of millions of dollars.

37:07.002 --> 37:10.587
Which is why you hired this man
to retrieve it.

37:10.607 --> 37:12.640
We're looking into
his financial records right now.

37:12.675 --> 37:13.975
It's only a matter of time

37:14.009 --> 37:15.210
before we connect him
to Modesto.

37:15.244 --> 37:16.482
[Scoffs]

37:16.502 --> 37:18.492
You're barking up
the wrong tree, detective.

37:18.512 --> 37:20.648
Modesto has its own
in-house investigators.

37:20.683 --> 37:23.218
If we wanted to recover
this dummy, as you claim,

37:23.252 --> 37:25.320
why would we entrust
such a sensitive task

37:25.354 --> 37:27.322
to an outsider?

37:28.557 --> 37:30.225
But I <i>have seen this man before.</i>

37:30.259 --> 37:30.959
Where?

37:30.993 --> 37:33.261
In front
of St. Simon's hospital.

37:33.295 --> 37:36.164
He was sitting in a car,
conferring with someone else.

38:08.297 --> 38:09.797

38:09.832 --> 38:11.933
A witness placed
the two of you together,

38:11.967 --> 38:13.201
and Sampson was more than eager

38:13.235 --> 38:14.519
to distance himself
from the murder.

38:14.539 --> 38:16.822
But he did admit
to breaking into Richie's office

38:16.842 --> 38:19.358
and hijacking
the crash-test dummy from us

38:19.378 --> 38:21.309
