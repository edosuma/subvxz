WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.252
You good? No after effects?

00:03.379 --> 00:06.214
How do you walk away from
a building collapse like that?

00:06.340 --> 00:08.383
You'd tell me if something
was wrong, right?

00:10.594 --> 00:12.428
I'd like you all to give a nice,
warm welcome

00:12.554 --> 00:14.972
to our new paramedic in charge,
Ms. Allison Rafferty.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.142
- Hi, Gabriella Dawson.
- Rebecca Jones.

00:18.268 --> 00:21.938
Her father is Deputy District's Chief,
Lionel Jones.

00:22.064 --> 00:25.024
He's very keen on having his daughter
get through the Academy.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.901
- I don't care whose kid she is.
- Make it work.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.532
OK, guys, if you can't pass this test,

00:32.658 --> 00:35.827
you won't pass the Firefighter II exam
given at the end of Academy training.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.746
Which means that you will not become
a firefighter. Simple as that.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.040
You have one hour, starting now.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.758
Hey.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.301
Hey, look at this.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.890
I remember taking this thing,
years ago.

01:20.622 --> 01:21.664
Hey, Chief.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.584
I see you haven't submitted the accident
report for the Quincy fire yet.

01:24.710 --> 01:28.045
Yeah, sorry about that. I'll get on it.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.631
Everything going OK? You feel good?

01:30.758 --> 01:32.467
Feel great.

01:32.593 --> 01:37.805
Just went to the doctor, he said
everything checks out, so, er... Yeah.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.184
Exactly what I want to hear.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.394
So, get that report done,
let's put it behind us.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.063
Will do. Thanks, Chief.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.486
Ah, will you look at this?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.071
Could they at least get you a t-shirt
that fit you?

01:54.198 --> 01:57.408
You will still sit with us, won't you?

01:57.534 --> 01:59.702
OK, I know the traditions.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.413
You guys have some sort of prank
planned for me. Well, good luck.

02:02.539 --> 02:06.334
Because I'm keeping my eyes wide open.

02:08.712 --> 02:12.006
Hey, Casey, how's Dawson doing at
the Academy? I miss my partner.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.509
Way to make the new girl feel welcome.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.636
Look, it's going to take
more than just homophobia

02:16.762 --> 02:19.096
and too much eye shadow
to win my affections, Rafferty.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.432
Hey, is Dawson coming by here?

02:21.558 --> 02:25.561
Because the bank is stepping in now
and they need us to come up with 10%

02:25.687 --> 02:27.063
of Molly's assessed value.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.899
And since we don't have
50,000 bucks lying around,

02:30.025 --> 02:33.653
- we're looking to get an extension.
- Yes, she'll be here.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.490
Hey, did you pick up lumber
at the salvage place?

02:37.616 --> 02:41.452
I did, but there's too much to fit in
my truck. We need transport.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.039
Hey, any of you guys have a contact
with a trucking company

02:45.165 --> 02:48.042
who can haul lumber on the cheap?
Or, better yet, for free?

02:48.168 --> 02:52.046
- Yes, Mouch? You know someone?
- No, I have a question.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.258
Even though he's no longer
the candidate,

02:55.384 --> 03:00.471
- Mills can still do the cooking, right?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.932
Forget it,
I already tossed my pots and pans.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.059
OK, starting next week,
we draw straws.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.644
In the meantime, I'll call Katie

03:06.770 --> 03:09.438
and see if she can cook up
something for us today.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.908
Hey. I want you to picture
something, all right?

03:21.034 --> 03:25.997
You, Katie, hanging out, having fun.
Getting all hetero on each other.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.292
And then, like most relationships,
it ends badly.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.712
And then Katie goes to Severide,
and she's like,

03:32.838 --> 03:36.841
"No, no. Otis broke my heart, Kelly.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.009
"He broke my heart."

03:42.389 --> 03:44.932
That's how that'll end, all right?

03:47.477 --> 03:49.979
Let me guess, you're in charge
of hardware store runs

03:50.105 --> 03:52.148
- for the big construction project?
- Mm-hmm.

03:53.442 --> 03:56.319
- Damn it.
- Are you Leslie Shay?

03:57.654 --> 04:00.948
No, I'm... Leslie Shay. Yeah.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.159
Ms. Shay, I've been trying to track you
down this week

04:03.285 --> 04:06.621
because I'm the successor trustee
for Darryl Bell.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.582
- And you're the trust beneficiary.
- The... The what?

04:09.708 --> 04:14.503
Mr. Bell designated that upon his death,
all of his assets be transferred to you.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.757
The keys to his apartment,
which now belongs to you.

04:17.883 --> 04:21.802
As does everything in it.
Here's all the relevant paperwork.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.471
- I don't want it.
- By law, it's yours.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.056
Whether you want it or not.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.562
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.898
Squad man to the rescue!

04:46.286 --> 04:49.580
Looks like we got a small fire on one.
51 get a line in there.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.832
Truck, Squad, give me primary search
on both floors.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.459
Clarke, Capp, second floor.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.003
Mills, grab a silver bullet.
Stay with me, we'll take the first.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.131
Cruz, raise the aerial.
Otis and Mouch, check the basement.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.257
Herrmann, with me.

05:07.391 --> 05:10.935
Fire department!
Everyone evacuate the building!

05:11.061 --> 05:13.396
Sir, we need you to head on outside.

05:13.522 --> 05:16.190
This is my home.
I can't leave my belongings.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.859
- Get out of here before you get hurt!
- Don't touch me.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.444
Great.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.285
- Mills, hit that.
- Yeah.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.455
Herrmann, right here.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.209
On three. One, two, three!

05:35.335 --> 05:38.170
Lieutenant,
we got a barbecue grill over here.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.678
It's propane. Everybody out!
It's going to blow!

05:58.191 --> 06:00.985
- Mills, you all right?
- I'm good.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.237
- Severide, status now.
- We're all OK.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.865
Got the victim out.
Propane grill exploded.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.701
One room fire. 51, get a line on it.

06:09.786 --> 06:14.874
BP is 112 over 74. Let's keep her at
15 litres and we'll go from there.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.293
All right, take some nice,
deep breathes for me, OK?

06:17.419 --> 06:20.254
You know how dangerous it is
to use a propane grill inside?

06:20.380 --> 06:23.090
- You're very lucky, young lady.
- Don't you yell at her.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.885
She was just doing what she could
to keep from freezing to death.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.472
The problem is our cheapskate landlord.
He won't fix the damn heat,

06:29.598 --> 06:32.349
so we're all doing whatever
we can to stay alive in there.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.279
Just heard two more
recruits dropped out.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.617
Stevenson and the short guy who threw up
after the hose drill yesterday.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.791
You know I can handle
the physical stuff, but...

06:56.917 --> 07:00.628
I have dyslexia, so the memorizing
and writing stuff down,

07:00.754 --> 07:01.962
it's always been tough for me.

07:03.632 --> 07:08.010
You're not the only person to come
to the Academy with dyslexia.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.178
Talk to the instructors.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.722
Instructor Severide's
already gunning for me.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.849
I don't want to give him more ammo.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.686
I have to study.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.193
I thought I'd put the Darryl stuff
behind me, which wasn't easy.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.195
- Why would he leave everything to me?
- Who knows?

07:26.321 --> 07:29.448
It don't want any of it. It just feels
like blood money, somehow.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.867
Hey, what kind of blood money
are we talking here?

07:31.993 --> 07:34.036
Get out of here.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.330
Hey, Clarke, what's this insignia mean?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.708
Darryl Bell was a Navy man.
Boatswain Mate, Third Class.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.044
I gotta deal with this.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.464
Hey, Mills, some guy
in the Tower looking for you.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.308
Kenny Bloomfeld
with the Chicago Sun-Times.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.352
I'm writing an article on you
for the paper.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.563
- On me?
- Yeah. You're one of the youngest guys

08:00.689 --> 08:03.357
ever to make Rescue Squad
for the CFD.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.484
That's quite an achievement.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.363
Do you have a minute to talk?

08:09.489 --> 08:12.908
Yeah, sure. Let's talk.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.246
Most guys are on the job for many years
before they make Squad.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.206
If they ever make it at all.

08:19.332 --> 08:24.003
So, what do you think
makes you so exceptional?

08:24.129 --> 08:27.214
Well, I'm good looking.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.675
Which, I think,
is the most important part.

08:29.801 --> 08:33.012
Honestly, 'cause CFD loves
a camera-ready face.

08:33.138 --> 08:36.807
And experience is really irrelevant
when all you do is eat and sleep,

08:36.933 --> 08:38.767
and eat and sleep, you know?

08:39.561 --> 08:40.603
Come on.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.814
No, really, we don't do much.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.401
I guess there's a reason why they say,
"Squad is the last to the fire,

08:47.527 --> 08:50.738
first to the dinner table," huh?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.245
This yard's perfect.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.247
Great get.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.583
- Listen, I have a favour to ask.
- Sure.

09:02.709 --> 09:08.631
Er, Chief asked me to fill out
the accident report from my injury.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.424
Doc said I checked out.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.260
But that there might be some
concussion-related memory issues

09:13.386 --> 09:16.430
for a while,
since I got my bell rung pretty good.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.434
The thing is, I don't remember
the two days leading up to the accident.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.521
What? Sounds like you got more
than just your bell rung.

09:24.648 --> 09:28.108
It's fine, trust me.
But if I tell Boden,

09:28.235 --> 09:31.237
red flags go up and suddenly
everything becomes a big deal.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.781
I just need a hand with the report.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.660
- You tell Dawson about all of this?
- Eh.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.119
I don't want her to worry.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.874
Sure, yeah.
I'll help with the report.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.794
Great.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.430
Jim Giovannetti?

10:00.225 --> 10:02.101
That's right.
Who are you?

10:02.227 --> 10:06.313
Wallace Boden, Battalion Chief
with the Chicago Fire Department.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.276
We put out a fire yesterday in a
building you own at 1100 Grant Place.

10:10.402 --> 10:15.906
Right.  Right.
Well, thank you for doing your job.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.325
While we were at the location,

10:18.451 --> 10:21.704
we noticed that your tenants
were jerry-rigging heaters

10:21.830 --> 10:24.456
to compensate for the fact
that there was no working heat.

10:24.582 --> 10:29.211
That's a very dangerous situation.
Not to mention, illegal.

10:29.337 --> 10:34.133
Well, I'll just have to go ahead
and talk to them about that.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.802
The heat works...
Works just fine, as far as I know.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.054
I find that very hard to believe.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.933
So, I have some advice for you,
Mr. Giovannetti.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.729
Make sure your tenants
have working heat immediately.

10:46.855 --> 10:50.065
Or the fire inspectors, they will
swarm all over your properties.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.067
The building department,
they'll condemn them.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.486
When we're done with you,
you won't be able to afford the rent

10:54.612 --> 10:56.613
in one of your own apartments.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.076
Do we understand each other?

11:02.871 --> 11:06.165
I'm happy to check on the heat again.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.666
Like I said.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.669
You do that.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.224
Darryl?

12:36.965 --> 12:38.799
Sorry if I scared you.

12:46.141 --> 12:49.268
I'm Jed. Darryl's brother.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.688
I'm guessing you're the paramedic
he left everything to.

12:52.814 --> 12:56.650
Yeah. I'm Leslie Shay. I, er...

12:56.776 --> 12:59.862
- Hi.
- Hi. I feel terrible about all this.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.655
I don't know why he left it to me. I...

13:01.781 --> 13:04.491
My brother was going through
a rough time, obviously,

13:04.617 --> 13:07.077
the last six months.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.080
He was angry at the world
'cause he was sick.

13:10.206 --> 13:14.084
Angry at me 'cause
I didn't do enough to help.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.211
But I tried, I really did.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.215
I'm so sorry.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.888
Look, I, um...

13:26.014 --> 13:28.974
I don't want the money,
so you can have it and...

13:30.018 --> 13:32.227
Yeah.

13:33.104 --> 13:36.106
That means so much to me and my family.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.233
I can't even tell you. Thank you.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.360
Of course. Yeah.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.325
What if I can't do it?

13:46.451 --> 13:48.702
Every time I put the mask on,
I get claustrophobic.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.412
Yeah, everyone does, at first.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.927
- I feel like I'm trapped in a fishbowl.
- All right, just size it up,

14:05.053 --> 14:08.931
and wear it when you study,
cook, watch TV,

14:09.057 --> 14:13.060
- for as long as you can. All right?
- I'll try. Thanks.

14:20.235 --> 14:23.070
- Who pissed you off?
- What do you mean?

14:24.572 --> 14:26.281
You've got that look.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.035
Rebecca Jones,
the other woman in my class?

14:32.288 --> 14:35.582
I saw her cheating. Do you think
I should tell Severide?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.751
No, absolutely not.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.672
Just keep your head down,
focus on your own work.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.049
Her colours will show
without you stepping in.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.301
Yeah.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.389
Oh.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.520
Your turn.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.320
You guys get one,
then we're coming for you.

15:05.446 --> 15:08.407
- Oh, come on, that was a classic.
- The fake reporter wasn't enough?

15:08.533 --> 15:10.659
You guys had to add
a lame chair gag on top of it?

15:10.785 --> 15:12.911
What reporter?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.540
Oh, very funny.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.004
- Hey, guys.
- Chow is up!

15:22.130 --> 15:24.214
Hey, er, let me...
Let me help you with that.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.091
Thanks.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.684
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:35.810 --> 15:41.023
I feel really uncomfortable going
behind Severide's back with this.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.651
With what? We haven't done anything
except play Settlers of Catan.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.446
- Then make out.
- That's the part I'm referring to.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.948
Then let's talk to him.
We can do it together.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.701
No, no. I'll do it.

15:52.827 --> 15:57.247
- What are you going to tell him?
- That I really like you.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.876
- And that I want to see more of you.
- That is so sweet.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.801
- Hey, Lieutenant, do you have a second?
- Yeah. What's up?

16:12.180 --> 16:15.807
I would like to ask Katie out on a date,

16:15.933 --> 16:18.602
and I was hoping for your blessing.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.455
Just checking the spark arrestor. Wanted
to make sure the motor was running good.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.706
That makes sense.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.793
Um...
What were we talking about?

16:42.919 --> 16:46.296
I don't know. I'm gonna go check
and see if lunch is ready.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.894
I want to ask your sister out, OK? I
have nothing but the best of intentions.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.021
Do I have your permission?

17:05.441 --> 17:06.900
Sure.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.903
Awesome. Because I'm telling you,
I am the ultimate...

17:10.029 --> 17:12.531
- Take "yes" as an answer, Otis.
- OK.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.744
Chicago Sun-Times.

17:17.870 --> 17:22.541
Hey, you happen to have a reporter
on staff named Kenny Bloomfeld?

17:22.667 --> 17:25.127
Please hold for that extension.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.924
Hello, this is Kenny,
I'm not available right now.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.468
Please leave a message
and I'll return your call.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.556
This mailbox is full. Goodbye.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.687
So, I called the lawyer and figured out

17:43.813 --> 17:45.564
the best way to hand
everything over to Jed.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.400
- Oh, good. So you're done with it.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:48.526 --> 17:51.236
How much do you think it's all worth?

17:51.362 --> 17:54.322
Well, it's the apartment
and, um, a couple bonds.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.907
And the military pension.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.410
I didn't see anything
about that in the paperwork.

17:58.536 --> 18:01.329
But, all in all,
whole thing's about 40,000.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.418
Ambulance 61, injured person.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.796
Bendon Shopping Plaza,
8350, North Michigan.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.180
The escalator just stopped out of
nowhere. Lady up top is stuck.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.940
I need help!

18:29.066 --> 18:30.525
I can't move.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.652
All right, we're gonna get you
out of here, OK?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.821
You're going to be all right.
What's your name?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.156
Ella.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.412
Ella, we might need to
give you a little haircut.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.873
- Oh, my God!
- I'll get the shears.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.558
OK, OK, calm down. It's OK. You're all
right. Don't move. Just don't move.

19:03.684 --> 19:08.688
Oh my God, oh my God!

19:18.157 --> 19:20.325
Nice work.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.994
Thanks.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.540
I hate it when Lakeshore is backed up.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.167
What's wrong with Chicago Med?
I like this place.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.298
Hey, Raff.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.973
You saved my life.
How can I thank you?

19:43.099 --> 19:46.309
Oh, sweetie. There's no need. Really.

19:49.814 --> 19:53.066
Ella Sterling, owner.
That's awesome.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.484
Leslie!

19:54.610 --> 19:57.654
Kendra. Oh, don't freak out.
Big lesbian hug about to go down.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.490
I'll avert my eyes.

20:00.616 --> 20:04.703
Hey, um, can you get the paperwork?
I'm gonna head back to the rig.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.204
Yeah, sure.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.292
How's Allison doing?

20:10.418 --> 20:12.961
Rafferty? She's fine. Why?

20:13.087 --> 20:14.796
No reason.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.301
Kendra, how do you know Rafferty?

20:19.427 --> 20:21.720
She was a resident here until last year.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.638
Her fiancé got Hodgkin's.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.516
She dropped out of the program
to take care of him.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.268
He died about six months ago.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.777
What took you so long?
Asking her advice on the latest Subaru?

20:39.655 --> 20:41.072
Yep.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.244
Chief Boden.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.498
Donna Robbins,
from the fire a few days ago?

20:50.625 --> 20:52.125
Yeah, yeah. Of course I remember.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.919
That landlord has never fixed a thing.

20:54.045 --> 20:57.881
My cupboard doors are broken,
the faucet drips.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.469
But I came home to a warm apartment
last night for the first time in months.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.555
I have a feeling you had something
to do with it.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.558
Yeah, I had a chat with him.

21:08.684 --> 21:12.604
Well, I made you some of
my special butternut squash puree.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.900
That was unnecessary,
but, er, very kind of you.

21:17.026 --> 21:20.654
I live alone, so I enjoy
making it for other people.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.995
Well, I'm gonna let you
get back to work.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.497
Thanks again for all that you did.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.626
You're welcome.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.930
Nice lady.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.181
Very.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.601
And you just let
her walk right out of here?

21:51.727 --> 21:53.812
- What was I supposed to do?
- Ask her out.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.605
- What?
- Chief, you didn't notice

21:55.731 --> 21:57.816
that she was flirting with you?

21:57.942 --> 22:00.151
Dropping the fact that she lives alone?

22:04.949 --> 22:06.950
You really think so?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.744
Uh-huh.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.215
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.051
So I called some of my buddies
down at Veterans Affairs.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.846
And, um,
it turns out that Darryl's brother

22:27.972 --> 22:30.557
is diverting that military pension
to himself.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.479
For a long time now.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.235
Thought you'd wanna know.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.362
Yeah. Thanks.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.575
That's pretty low.

22:51.787 --> 22:55.457
Hey, look, I know how terrible this
whole experience has been for you.

22:55.583 --> 22:59.669
But it seems to me like something good
can come out of this.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.880
OK.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.673
We're not grave robbers, you know.

23:03.799 --> 23:07.177
And I say this with great respect
for all that you've been through

23:07.303 --> 23:09.345
and what you clearly meant to the guy.

23:09.472 --> 23:13.933
- Things happen for a reason.
- Meaning what?

23:14.060 --> 23:17.270
Meaning, you can convert this money into
something positive like helping me,

23:17.396 --> 23:20.940
Herrmann and Dawson hold onto Molly's.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.692
I'm not keeping the money, guys.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.277
But I just heard Clarke tell you that

23:24.403 --> 23:27.280
the brother was stealing
from Darryl's pension.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.366
The guy's a common criminal. I mean,
no surprise that Darryl stiffed him.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.494
I don't want the money.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.955
I don't want it.

23:41.295 --> 23:43.379
Lamb looks good.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.131
Who could eat a baby sheep?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.258
Not me. Horrible.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.559
Veal looks amazing, though.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.901
Hey. What is that guy's problem?

24:05.027 --> 24:07.320
He keeps looking over here.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.450
I'm sure it's no big deal.
Should we get appetizers?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.579
Hey.

24:17.748 --> 24:20.500
Can I help you with something?

24:22.086 --> 24:25.296
Just looking out at my car. It's new.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.632
Don't like parking it on the street.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.099
Got it.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.768
A simple apology would be nice.

24:39.895 --> 24:43.273
- Would it?
- What's your problem?

24:43.399 --> 24:45.275
Sounds like to me
you're the one with a problem.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.569
Matt! Matt, it's no big deal.
Come on!

24:47.695 --> 24:49.737
Listen to your girl, pal.

24:49.864 --> 24:55.076
- Hey! Matt! Stop!
- This guy is a psycho!

24:55.202 --> 24:58.163
- It's fine. It's fine. It's cool.
- No, you need to leave.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.165
- Now.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

25:00.291 --> 25:04.711
- It's cool. He's cool.
- Come on. Come on.

25:05.713 --> 25:06.921
Come on.

25:23.355 --> 25:27.358
We should start looking at apartments
this weekend, if you want.

25:32.281 --> 25:35.408
- Baby?
- Hm?

25:35.534 --> 25:38.036
That was not you, last night.

25:38.162 --> 25:40.747
I've never seen you
act that way in my life.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.253
I can't say sorry enough times.
I'll make it up to you.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.216
I'm not worried about the dinner,
I'm worried about you.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.552
If we're gonna do this,
you need to be honest with me.

25:54.678 --> 25:58.848
I'm fine. I haven't been sleeping great.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.392
That's just part of getting back
on the work schedule.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.770
I'm better every day.

26:07.191 --> 26:08.566
I promise.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.074
Hey!

26:16.200 --> 26:18.993
Hey, Kenny! Kenny, hey.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.496
There you are, man.

26:21.622 --> 26:23.665
Look, I don't know if
you got any of my emails,

26:23.791 --> 26:26.751
but I just want you to know I was
completely kidding in that interview.

26:26.877 --> 26:29.420
- I thought the whole thing was a prank.
- You said what you said.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.882
No. No, Kenny.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.677
Kenny, listen, the guys,
we do this whole thing.

26:35.803 --> 26:38.304
They play pranks. Kenny! No!

26:43.269 --> 26:46.020
All right, listen up.
Once we get the smoke up and started,

26:46.146 --> 26:47.730
I'll send you in two by two.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.900
You'll make your way through the tower,
and then back out the other side.

26:51.026 --> 26:54.696
Some of the spaces are tight, but
they're all manageable, so no excuses.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.824
And mask up at the door.
Reiger, Price. You're up.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.913
We got this, Dawson. No sweat.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.373
Jones, Dawson. Go.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.364
It's a low bridge.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.325
Go for it.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.278
You good?

28:21.283 --> 28:23.493
It's OK. Come on, Dawson.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.016
No points for speed,
but you two made it.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.602
Go on inside.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.438
Thanks.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.733
No worries. I owed you one.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.783
Is that, er, the Sunday paper, Chief?

29:03.909 --> 29:05.618
No.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.621
It's the Friday paper
because today is Friday.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.541
Yeah, right. That makes sense.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.626
What can I do for you, Mills?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.711
I wanted to give you a heads-up.

29:15.838 --> 29:19.632
A reporter came by, er,
and I thought the guys had set it up,

29:19.758 --> 29:22.844
messing with me because of
the Squad promotion.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.805
I said some things that
I probably shouldn't have.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.890
Yeah?

29:28.016 --> 29:32.645
Yeah, some really stupid things, Chief.
Er.

29:32.771 --> 29:36.357
Possibly embarrassing
to the department things.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.736
You know what, Mills?

29:44.408 --> 29:46.242
I'm gonna take your advice.

29:48.412 --> 29:50.663
I...

29:50.789 --> 29:51.998
I'm gonna go see that woman.

30:03.218 --> 30:07.847
Glad I got my washing in before
your flannel shirts broke the machine.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.311
Look, Rafferty, um.

30:14.313 --> 30:18.316
I just want to say that, er, you know,
I went through a really rough time

30:18.442 --> 30:22.695
a little while back, and I...
I didn't reach out to anyone.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.031
I didn't talk to anybody.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.283
I held onto it, and, er,

30:27.409 --> 30:29.660
it almost swallowed me up.

30:30.829 --> 30:31.662
So...

30:34.249 --> 30:40.254
You know, if you ever want
to talk to anybody, I'm here.

30:42.466 --> 30:43.841
OK?

31:02.486 --> 31:03.319
Hey.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.532
- Accident report.
- Thank you.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.704
All right. I understand.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.541
Thank you for your time.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.755
The bank.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.757
What'd they say?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.884
Molly's extension was denied.

31:28.762 --> 31:30.972
All that hard work.

31:31.098 --> 31:35.768
All the love and money that you
and me and Dawson

31:35.894 --> 31:39.021
poured into Molly's was for nothing.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.190
Oh, hey, man,
it wasn't for nothing.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.193
Molly's was like a second home to us
since you guys fixed it up.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.613
- I got engaged there, huh?
- The un-engaged.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.282
- Thanks, Mouch.
- Bruce is right.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.159
Dawson was just saying how Molly's
pulled her through some rough times.

31:52.286 --> 31:55.037
- It's got all of us through.
- It wasn't for nothing, Herrmann.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.789
It was a great ride.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.042
And in honour of that,
we should send Molly's out with a bang.

32:00.168 --> 32:04.130
Yeah, huh? Why not throw one last,
big, ass-kicker of a party, huh?

32:05.257 --> 32:10.303
Hermann, you gave it a good shot.
It's gonna be OK, buddy.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.313
Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61, man trapped.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.245
A photographer went up on the roof
to get some skyline pictures,

32:36.371 --> 32:39.457
but a guest saw him climb onto
the smokestack and fall in.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.001
- He wasn't supposed to go up there.
- Get your facility manager.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.420
Shut the heat plant down,
get it to blow only air.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.964
OK, everybody, all the way up. Let's go.

32:50.969 --> 32:54.013
Severide, head up that chimney ladder.
Get a look in.

32:58.852 --> 33:01.937
Casey, looks like the bend
in the shaft hits at the 25th floor.

33:02.064 --> 33:03.939
See if you can find a way
in from that level.

33:04.066 --> 33:06.400
- Should be a centre stairwell.
- Copy that, Chief.

33:14.618 --> 33:18.079
I got him. He's jammed in there pretty
good, at the break off point

33:18.205 --> 33:21.165
- about 20 feet down.
- Is he breathing?

33:21.291 --> 33:24.877
- I can't tell.
- Is there any way in from the inside?

33:25.003 --> 33:26.837
Two layers of steel
and brick down here.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.756
It'll take us hours to get close.

33:28.882 --> 33:31.008
Then we go in from above.

33:31.134 --> 33:34.345
We rig the roof ladder. We'll set it up
as an overhead anchor point.

33:34.471 --> 33:35.638
Copy that.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.182
- You ready to go down and get him?
- I'm all over it.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.911
All right. Listen, it's too narrow
for a backboard.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.955
When you get down to him,
wrap him up in the webbing,

34:01.081 --> 34:02.206
we'll muscle both of you up.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.916
Make sure he's secure
before you move him.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.419
He slides any further down,
it's a 30-story drop to the bottom.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.879
- Got it.
- OK. Let's go!

34:12.259 --> 34:15.136
Tension in the line.

34:15.262 --> 34:19.348
More. He's in. Going down.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.901
Hey, can you hear me?

34:31.027 --> 34:33.612
- Hey, he's alive.
- Get that webbing around him.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.450
Don't move. I'm gonna hook you onto
our pulley system, OK?

34:44.499 --> 34:48.502
Mills? Mills?

34:49.504 --> 34:52.047
Yeah, we're almost there. Almost there.

35:00.307 --> 35:03.309
- Hey, I got him.
- Let's go!

35:12.444 --> 35:14.445
Hold it right there.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.740
Go ahead.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.575
Got his feet.

35:19.701 --> 35:22.244
- You got him?
- I got his head.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.834
You ready. One, two, three.

35:44.768 --> 35:48.646
- You said the lawyer would call.
- Yeah, and he will.

35:48.772 --> 35:51.649
You're playing games, aren't you?
Bet that's what you did with my brother.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.026
Wonder what you promised him
that you didn't deliver.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.028
- What?
- Are you gonna transfer

35:56.154 --> 35:58.072
his assets to me or not?

36:01.993 --> 36:04.328
Did you take your brother's
military pension?

36:08.792 --> 36:11.544
- That's my business.
- Answer the question.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.672
Lady, I don't think you know
who you're messing with.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.134
Everything OK out here?

36:19.261 --> 36:22.263
Yeah. This is, er...

36:22.389 --> 36:26.600
This is Darryl's brother, Jed.
He was just leaving.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.187
Start moving in that direction.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.171
- There's a mitre saw here.
- This is working fine.

36:56.298 --> 36:57.756
There's a mitre saw right here.

37:00.427 --> 37:05.306
Hey. Look, I'm not one
to preach to anybody,

37:05.432 --> 37:07.933
but last year after my injury,
when things went south,

37:08.059 --> 37:10.853
the reason I made it through is because
I went to Dawson and asked for help.

37:10.979 --> 37:13.314
The doctor was sure
it's a temporary thing.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.483
The cobwebs are gonna clear up.

37:16.610 --> 37:19.320
Did you hear what I said?

37:19.446 --> 37:21.447
I need to know you heard what I said.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.576
I did, yeah.

37:35.670 --> 37:39.590
- It kind of comes and goes.
- What does?

37:40.675 --> 37:43.552
Chunks of time. Where I remember.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.388
We talking before or after the accident?

37:47.682 --> 37:48.891
Both.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.174
Chief Boden.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.134
No, no, no. Please, call me Wallace.

38:26.721 --> 38:27.930
Er.

38:28.515 --> 38:31.433
I heard you had a cabinet needed fixing.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.353
Oh, yes, I do.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.565
And by happy coincidence,
you're just in time for dinner.

38:38.692 --> 38:41.276
Oh, is that so?

38:42.696 --> 38:44.738
Come on in.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.159
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.415
- I loved this place.
- Me too.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.542
You know, I had sex on that bar once.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.836
Oh, my God, me...

38:58.962 --> 39:01.296
Didn't.

39:01.423 --> 39:03.424
Did... Did not.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.637
To Molly's.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.723
Just one more failed business venture

39:10.849 --> 39:15.978
on the scrapheap of
Christopher Herrmann, incorporated.

39:18.565 --> 39:21.400
- Hello, Professor.
- Somebody's had a few.

39:21.526 --> 39:24.445
Yes. Does that mean that you'll tell me
how I did on my exam?

39:24.571 --> 39:28.449
Well, I might as well,
you'll find out tomorrow.

39:28.575 --> 39:31.577
- You got an 87.
- Nice job, Dawson!

39:31.703 --> 39:33.537
Pretty good for a girl, right?

39:33.663 --> 39:37.458
Hey...  What did, er...
What did Jones get?

39:37.584 --> 39:40.252
- Come on.
- I'm losing my bar.

39:40.378 --> 39:43.797
It's been a rough night.
Throw a scrap my way?

39:46.009 --> 39:48.385
98.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.056
Wow. That's impressive.

39:52.182 --> 39:56.602
CFD Brass is gonna be all over her
come graduation.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.564
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.274
Don't make fun of me.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.277
It's a Tahitian Tingle,
and I know it's dorky but I love it.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.488
I love that drink too.

40:08.490 --> 40:12.242
I was thinking maybe after the party
tonight, you can come over?

40:12.368 --> 40:16.955
- To your place?
- Yes. No one else is there tonight.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.250
I might even let you go to second base.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.796
Are we talking about your second base
or my second base?

40:23.922 --> 40:26.924
- Is there a second base for guys?
- You know what it is,

40:27.050 --> 40:29.093
I'm probably confusing
second base for third base.

40:29.219 --> 40:31.845
Oh, my God. I do that, too!

40:33.389 --> 40:37.184
Mills, I think you know Kenny.

40:38.853 --> 40:43.649
What? I called the Sun-Times.

40:43.775 --> 40:47.778
I am a reporter there,
but I do the home and garden beat.

40:47.904 --> 40:51.698
OK. Who... Who put you up to it?

40:52.867 --> 40:55.869
Wally Boden.
He's my next door neighbour.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.543
I am in!

41:02.669 --> 41:05.921
If Boden is busting my balls
then I have finally made it!

41:06.047 --> 41:09.049
I am in! Yes! Drinks are on me!

41:11.177 --> 41:14.346
Guys, guys. Guys, we just poured
cement mix down the toilets!

41:14.472 --> 41:17.099
Yeah, let the banks try
flushing those babies!

41:17.225 --> 41:18.475
Guys.

41:19.477 --> 41:22.354
Guys, um...

41:22.480 --> 41:24.356
The money's for you.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.899
It's yours, for Molly's.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.319
Yeah, whoo!

41:32.490 --> 41:35.200
Yes! Oh!

41:35.326 --> 41:37.202
I love you.

41:39.706 --> 41:41.790
Hey, to Shay!

41:41.916 --> 41:44.251
And Molly's! Back in business!
