03:51.905 --> 03:53.155
No.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.003
Hey!

03:58.699 --> 04:00.214
Anybody out there?

04:03.144 --> 04:04.433
Can anybody hear me?

04:07.633 --> 04:09.827
I'll get this son-of-a-bitch open.

04:53.786 --> 04:55.349
Holy shit!

05:01.021 --> 05:02.669
Oh...

05:04.896 --> 05:06.865
Not my new engine.

05:13.184 --> 05:14.856
Oh, great.

05:14.996 --> 05:16.708
Warn me Lord.

05:19.362 --> 05:20.604
Damn!

05:32.128 --> 05:33.776
Don't you like it?

05:34.331 --> 05:36.073
I was that loud.

05:36.746 --> 05:38.230
No, I meant, chilli.

05:39.064 --> 05:41.049
It's OK. I guess I'm just not very hungry.

05:41.197 --> 05:42.728
Anything else then?

05:42.846 --> 05:46.033
Bring me another coke and
change the station for me.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.432
Sure.

05:56.807 --> 06:00.385
Two chocolate shakes and
two burgers to go, well done.

06:00.552 --> 06:04.443
Shake two browns,
two clays to walking, kill them.

06:08.037 --> 06:08.935
Now...

06:10.958 --> 06:12.607
I'm Lucy.

06:13.310 --> 06:14.427
I'm Brewster.

06:14.927 --> 06:16.177
May I ask you a question?

06:16.255 --> 06:17.708
Long as is personal.

06:18.735 --> 06:19.970
You live around here long?

06:20.110 --> 06:21.071
Why?

06:21.931 --> 06:23.290
You're goin' to take me away?

06:23.399 --> 06:24.939
Not what exactly what I have in mind.

06:25.006 --> 06:28.452
I know what you got in mind.
And I liked it.

06:28.726 --> 06:30.077
But, I'm working.

06:30.538 --> 06:31.983
Lucy, I got a problem.

06:33.489 --> 06:34.934
Like I told you.

06:35.114 --> 06:37.778
Wait 'til after work and
I'll solve it for you.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.567
Now, I just bet you could, do you?

06:40.684 --> 06:43.372
Someone stole some parts
of my car this morning.

06:43.528 --> 06:47.559
- Suppose is there any chance that maybe...
- About time I get back to work.

06:54.483 --> 06:56.678
Damn! They've done it again!

07:01.047 --> 07:04.375
Hey, come back here!
You forgot the check!

07:04.477 --> 07:05.860
What about my tip?

07:05.938 --> 07:08.766
I'm calling the cop, you hear?

07:10.158 --> 07:11.064
So...

07:39.152 --> 07:40.909
Son-of-a-bitch!

08:38.671 --> 08:40.116
Oh, shit!

08:49.125 --> 08:50.664
Hey!

09:21.309 --> 09:23.059
Hurry up!

09:25.777 --> 09:27.934
My God!
Those are just kids.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.426
Come on.

09:49.636 --> 09:50.652
Come on.

09:51.707 --> 09:52.590
Give me your hand.

09:53.043 --> 09:54.043
Give me your hand.

09:56.332 --> 09:57.340
Here we go.

10:00.620 --> 10:03.416
- Breezy, come and get me!
- Hey!

10:03.573 --> 10:04.893
Little Harry's still out there.

10:04.932 --> 10:07.183
- Come and get me, Breezy!
- Little Harry!

10:10.645 --> 10:12.231
Hurry up, mister!

10:12.442 --> 10:14.871
- Come on, mister. Get him!
- Get him!

10:23.555 --> 10:25.273
OK, kid.
You OK?

10:25.422 --> 10:26.836
Get on my back.

10:27.336 --> 10:28.625
Wait a second.

10:31.970 --> 10:33.149
OK, get on.

10:33.228 --> 10:34.797
Put your hands around my neck.

10:45.291 --> 10:46.135
Hurry!

10:46.260 --> 10:47.486
- Come on!
- Come on, hurry!

10:47.549 --> 10:48.556
Hurry up!

10:48.908 --> 10:50.572
Hurry up, mister.

10:57.385 --> 10:59.001
Hold on. We got you.

11:12.248 --> 11:13.967
You wanna die, mister?

11:14.131 --> 11:15.427
Oh, God. I hope so.

11:16.022 --> 11:17.240
Damn!

11:17.451 --> 11:19.350
Mister, you look like shit.

11:19.514 --> 11:20.975
But, put it there anyhow.

11:21.124 --> 11:23.647
Wouldn't for you, I've lost my kid brother.

11:26.373 --> 11:28.492
Hey, what the hell?
My parts are on that truck.

11:28.732 --> 11:30.880
No, sir.
They were already been delivered.

11:32.836 --> 11:34.367
Delivered to who?

11:37.985 --> 11:39.547
Oh, you're not talking , huh?

11:39.687 --> 11:42.625
So, we'll see how much talking you do
when we get to your parents, OK?

11:42.719 --> 11:46.016
Hold it, damn it.
That's our truck sinking out there.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.125
You'll get your truck back
when I get my parts back, all right?

11:49.508 --> 11:50.571
Come on.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.966
Thanks to you guys,
my trailer hitch is screwed up too.

11:56.028 --> 11:59.091
Look, if we can fix it, it ain't broken,
all right? Take it easy mister.

11:59.154 --> 12:00.482
That ain't no lie.

12:03.467 --> 12:04.811
Where is this thing, uh...?

12:08.584 --> 12:10.451
There you see your hitch is jammed.
That's all.

12:10.514 --> 12:11.584
It's easy.

12:16.084 --> 12:17.256
OK, count on Harry.

12:17.327 --> 12:18.405
One thousand one.

12:18.452 --> 12:19.514
One thousand two.

12:19.593 --> 12:20.561
One thousand three.

12:20.616 --> 12:21.819
One thousand four.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.280
One thousand five.

12:23.351 --> 12:24.616
One thousand six.

12:24.670 --> 12:26.030
One thousand seven.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.702
One thousand twenty two.

12:28.795 --> 12:30.100
One thousand twenty three.

12:30.139 --> 12:31.312
One thousand twenty four.

12:31.671 --> 12:32.944
One thousand twenty five.

12:34.065 --> 12:36.253
All right.
There it is.

12:37.066 --> 12:38.339
How's that, mister?

12:38.721 --> 12:40.613
My brothers don't mess around.

12:41.041 --> 12:43.463
That's Doc.
He's the family genious.

12:44.549 --> 12:46.776
This is Louis.
He does the heavy work.

12:46.955 --> 12:48.229
That's Steven, our accountant.

12:48.276 --> 12:49.901
I don't like being an accountant.

12:50.049 --> 12:51.284
That's little Harry.

12:51.518 --> 12:53.541
He's too small that
he makes step time thing.

12:53.651 --> 12:56.494
We call him that after our Pa, big Harry.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.026
And this is Swifty.

12:59.494 --> 13:02.534
I guess we call him a mouth piece.

13:02.791 --> 13:04.861
And I am Heather.
I just do the driving.

13:04.916 --> 13:06.104
It's Breezy.

13:06.276 --> 13:07.307
Heather.

13:07.502 --> 13:08.752
We're the Akins family.

13:08.846 --> 13:10.338
Call her Breezy.

13:10.534 --> 13:11.681
- Heather.
- Breezy.

13:11.713 --> 13:12.635
Hold it.

13:12.838 --> 13:13.823
Come here.

13:13.987 --> 13:15.112
Where do you guys live?

13:15.199 --> 13:16.659
Back the way we came.

13:16.737 --> 13:18.917
OK, I want two of you
to help me hitch up this trailer.

13:18.957 --> 13:21.738
I want the rest of you
in the camper, now.

13:25.450 --> 13:26.567
Good to go!

14:03.719 --> 14:05.297
Home sweet home.

14:24.726 --> 14:26.265
OK, where are your folks?

14:26.578 --> 14:28.226
I told you they ain't here.

14:29.914 --> 14:31.453
If they're not here,
where are they?

14:31.609 --> 14:33.164
They're just not available.

14:33.321 --> 14:35.118
Not in a while.

14:38.641 --> 14:40.516
I see six bunks.
What's going on here?

14:40.563 --> 14:43.039
Our truck's washing away in the red river.

14:43.156 --> 14:44.922
That's what's going on.

14:45.039 --> 14:47.828
I don't wanna hear another word
about that truck. You understand?

14:47.965 --> 14:50.348
That smart mouth of your
is gonna get you in trouble, boy.

14:50.574 --> 14:52.012
We're already in trouble.

14:52.129 --> 14:54.332
You don't know anything
about being in trouble.

14:54.464 --> 14:56.324
I don't find out what
you did with my parts,

14:56.371 --> 14:59.332
I'm gonna sling all six of you in
the state reformatory in Houston.

14:59.442 --> 15:01.512
What is the form-story?

15:01.676 --> 15:04.309
It's a place for bad little boys.
It's a jail.

15:04.464 --> 15:07.121
I don't wanna go to no form-story.

15:07.317 --> 15:08.371
Me neither.

15:08.457 --> 15:11.395
You ain't gonna sling messy-morning
in crummy places.

15:11.496 --> 15:13.613
That ain't no lie.
Me either.

15:15.918 --> 15:17.964
Holy shit.
It's big John.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.793
Don't tell him we told you nothing, mister.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.629
Who's big John?

15:20.672 --> 15:23.180
Get your asses out here on the double.

15:23.304 --> 15:27.062
- Who is big John?
- Stay in here, please. Just stay in here.

15:28.786 --> 15:30.708
What the hell you got in here?

15:30.840 --> 15:33.724
You suppose to strip cars, not steal them.

15:34.669 --> 15:38.020
Ain't that same rig you stripped down
at over Twellenger station?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.602
It's quite of scam
you got going, sheriff.

15:41.829 --> 15:43.336
Who the hell are you?

15:43.704 --> 15:45.688
You should know,
you got all my parts.

15:48.005 --> 15:50.489
You'll have the hell of
the time proving anything.

15:50.676 --> 15:53.411
Take a blind judge of your brother-in-law
not see what you're up to.

15:53.505 --> 15:54.926
Let me waste some John.

15:55.492 --> 15:57.679
- Let me lamb blast him.
- Shut up Otis.

15:57.788 --> 16:01.226
I'm black you fell in to a real
thick pile of beans, boy.

16:01.427 --> 16:02.951
We got you for...

16:03.185 --> 16:05.576
break in and exit at over Twellenger.

16:05.670 --> 16:08.366
And the second degree
larceny at the diner.

16:08.694 --> 16:11.030
Whatever else I can think of.

16:12.366 --> 16:13.280
Cuff him.

16:14.194 --> 16:15.725
Hey, take it easy.

16:16.451 --> 16:17.756
You're gonna read me my right?

16:17.827 --> 16:19.014
What about my phone call?

16:19.069 --> 16:20.379
Oh, sure.

16:20.504 --> 16:22.012
Let me get you a dial tone.

16:22.708 --> 16:25.762
Add "resisting arrest" to that list, Otis.

16:26.192 --> 16:28.020
I knew I think of something.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.848
Ah-ha!

16:33.049 --> 16:34.955
- Bingo.
- Oh!

16:35.541 --> 16:38.034
Whoo-whoo-whoo.
Un-dork-a-dee!

16:38.448 --> 16:39.987
Whoo-wooh!

16:41.342 --> 16:43.115
I need a red seven.

16:43.756 --> 16:47.670
Ooh, red seven, come on home to papa.

16:48.413 --> 16:49.374
Ah-dee.

16:51.124 --> 16:52.890
What you're doing here, boy?

16:53.273 --> 16:55.063
Bringing some food for the prisoner.

16:55.187 --> 16:56.148
How come?

16:56.609 --> 16:59.242
'Cause he saved my brother's life.
That's how come.

16:59.688 --> 17:01.102
What you got there?

17:01.469 --> 17:02.391
Fruit.

17:02.531 --> 17:03.430
Fruit?

17:03.688 --> 17:04.906
Let me see that.

17:06.172 --> 17:07.680
Ain't one of your tricks, is it?

17:07.992 --> 17:09.461
No, sir.

17:12.633 --> 17:14.436
Ain't nothing but fruit here.

17:14.835 --> 17:16.992
I thought for a second
you tried to pull a fast food.

17:17.039 --> 17:18.921
How do you like that for a fast food?

17:20.164 --> 17:21.156
Easy boy.

17:21.265 --> 17:23.453
Take it easy.
It's real gun you got there.

17:23.508 --> 17:25.234
On your knees, cowboy.

17:25.398 --> 17:26.469
You kidding.

17:28.406 --> 17:30.375
Oh, my God!
You're not kidding.

17:30.515 --> 17:31.750
Don't shoot.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.429
Please, don't shoot.

17:33.563 --> 17:35.984
I'm on my knees.
I'm on my knees. See?

17:40.040 --> 17:41.790
I can't...I can't do this.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.813
I do what he says if I were you, Otis.

17:43.954 --> 17:45.938
Are you sure these bullets are real?

17:53.956 --> 17:55.409
Wait. Hey, hold it...

17:55.519 --> 17:57.823
What you gonna do?
You gonna kill me?

17:57.925 --> 17:59.863
You know it's not a bad idea, Otis.

18:00.284 --> 18:02.683
Lucky for you, I am a non-violent man.

18:05.503 --> 18:06.792
Let's go.

18:12.368 --> 18:14.532
Holy shit!
It's big John.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.259
OK, here.

18:23.349 --> 18:24.459
Otis!

18:24.740 --> 18:26.677
You got in progrip, boy?

18:27.131 --> 18:31.384
I want to get a crack at your paycheck
before your while get a hold of it all.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.381
- Oh.
- Otis!

18:33.506 --> 18:35.358
Oh...

18:35.967 --> 18:38.452
Lord Almighty, what happened to you?

18:55.029 --> 18:56.427
We gotta the hell out of here.

18:56.490 --> 18:58.084
Cool out.
The boys are doing something.

18:58.147 --> 18:59.795
What are you talking about?
These guys are crazy.

18:59.842 --> 19:03.154
That sheriff is gonna blow that door off
the hinge any second now.

19:04.785 --> 19:06.903
I told you so.
Where the hell are those kids?

19:06.988 --> 19:08.793
OK, pedal it.
Come on.

19:11.793 --> 19:14.418
I don't get a vote.
This is piece of cake, boy.

19:20.340 --> 19:21.301
There!

19:28.513 --> 19:29.919
How long we got?

19:30.130 --> 19:31.684
How long we got for what?

19:31.880 --> 19:34.920
- What are you guys uo to, now?
- Come on. Break it. Go!

19:37.350 --> 19:38.334
Count down ten.

19:38.608 --> 19:39.897
Ten.

19:40.108 --> 19:41.233
Nine.

19:41.842 --> 19:42.967
Eight.

19:45.272 --> 19:47.709
We got you, boser. Don't hitch.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.084
- Three.
- Oh, my God!

19:49.115 --> 19:49.796
Two.

19:49.983 --> 19:50.866
One.

19:52.061 --> 19:53.897
Hey, Lord Almighty!

19:53.945 --> 19:56.843
- It's working!
- All right!

19:57.296 --> 19:58.921
Yeah!

20:04.977 --> 20:05.853
All right.

20:17.503 --> 20:19.441
Nothing but clear highway behind us.

20:19.573 --> 20:20.933
He'll fire us.

20:21.027 --> 20:22.097
Whoa!

20:29.993 --> 20:31.439
What's with this radio?

20:31.985 --> 20:34.407
That thing's been broken for two years.

20:50.713 --> 20:52.955
What's the fuck can fix it
if it ain't broken.

20:53.358 --> 20:55.272
I guess you leaned that by now.

21:11.424 --> 21:13.174
Not very much I don't know about car.

21:13.557 --> 21:15.549
My Pa was the best mechanic
in the west Texas.

21:15.659 --> 21:17.417
That ain't no lie.

21:21.191 --> 21:22.324
You have a bathroom in here?

21:22.496 --> 21:23.621
I did have.

21:23.887 --> 21:25.808
I took it out when
I put my office in the back.

21:26.543 --> 21:28.652
Could you pull over?
Little Harry's got to go.

21:42.572 --> 21:44.017
Be careful.

21:44.579 --> 21:45.525
Slow.

21:45.986 --> 21:47.353
OK, go ahead.

21:48.556 --> 21:50.197
You're a race car driver, mister?

21:50.446 --> 21:52.048
I used to be.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.119
I might have been again
if I didn't run into you guys.

21:56.376 --> 21:58.314
Why you quit in the first place?
What happended?

21:58.704 --> 22:00.188
He might be in a bad crash.

22:00.243 --> 22:01.860
Probably nearly killed his ass.

22:01.931 --> 22:03.438
Maybe, he lost his nerve.

22:03.524 --> 22:05.251
Nah.
It was the booze.

22:05.313 --> 22:07.008
Turned in to a slash.

22:07.172 --> 22:08.258
Slug, Harry.

22:08.305 --> 22:10.602
A no good lousy Alfie.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.563
It was a woman.
Must be a woman broken his heart.

22:15.860 --> 22:19.594
A washed-up, broken hearted,
chicken shit, acky bumb.

22:20.970 --> 22:23.782
God!
What imagination!

22:24.213 --> 22:28.268
I don't suppose one of you guys would want to
tell me how you start stripping cars, wouldn't you?

22:35.213 --> 22:37.384
Our folks were killed in a wreck.

22:38.134 --> 22:40.322
And we got kicked out of our house.

22:40.619 --> 22:42.510
But, we had to keep eating. So,...

22:42.697 --> 22:45.385
Doc stripped a car one night
out front of Twellenger.

22:45.752 --> 22:47.354
And big John caught us.

22:47.518 --> 22:48.768
And set you up in business.

22:48.846 --> 22:50.260
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:50.354 --> 22:51.401
Uhuh.

22:51.549 --> 22:53.768
So, that's how you became
a big time crooks, huh?

22:53.869 --> 22:55.385
- Right.
- Yeah.

22:56.002 --> 22:58.705
You know, you could have called
a county authority or something.

22:58.893 --> 23:01.080
Wrong. Big John told us
he'd bust us up.

23:01.170 --> 23:02.959
He says our relatives are all over.

23:03.045 --> 23:04.623
Uncle Pete at Spokey.

23:04.785 --> 23:06.113
Aunt Harriet at Lentz.

23:06.179 --> 23:09.710
And Aunt Ester who I was in a bath
to go I can't always she smells.

23:09.788 --> 23:10.491
Where?

23:10.612 --> 23:11.557
You know why.

23:11.635 --> 23:14.073
Heat rotten her feet or something.

23:14.495 --> 23:16.721
And nobody or nothing's gonna bust us up.

23:16.823 --> 23:18.417
That ain't no lie.

23:36.229 --> 23:38.362
- Where're headed?
- Shreveport.

23:38.479 --> 23:40.940
- Take us there?
- Oh, no.

23:41.218 --> 23:42.866
I told you Breezy.

23:42.968 --> 23:45.983
- Son-of-a-bitch wouldn't listen.
- Watch your mouth Shifty.

23:46.066 --> 23:49.050
It's Swifty! SWIFTY!
You toad sucker.

23:49.089 --> 23:49.925
Shut up Swifty.

23:50.339 --> 23:52.160
You got to take us to Shreveport, mister.

23:52.293 --> 23:54.511
I'm taking you to the next town, period.

23:54.632 --> 23:57.945
But, all these small Texas towns are
the same. They all just call big John.

23:58.069 --> 24:01.788
- Please.
- Please. Please. Please.

24:02.546 --> 24:04.913
Shreveport.
And that's it.

24:05.085 --> 24:06.812
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:09.116 --> 24:10.475
Good. Still beating.

24:10.592 --> 24:12.366
So, wake me up when
we got to Shreveport.

24:12.468 --> 24:14.054
I don't wanna miss nothing.

24:19.557 --> 24:21.510
Hee-hee yah!

24:22.096 --> 24:23.315
Whoa!

24:30.110 --> 24:31.532
Wait for it.

24:41.391 --> 24:42.501
Whoa!

24:50.621 --> 24:52.136
Come on, guys.

24:52.535 --> 24:54.379
Don't look at me like that.

24:55.894 --> 24:57.597
Now, we talk about this.

24:57.933 --> 24:59.863
You're gonna spend the night in a motel...

25:00.082 --> 25:01.246
and tomorrow morning...

25:01.347 --> 25:03.300
you go down to the bus depot,
four blocks away,

25:03.363 --> 25:06.106
you take your bus anywhere
in the world you want to go.

25:06.441 --> 25:08.973
I'm trying to get back
in the race after two years.

25:09.207 --> 25:11.637
That requires a 100% concentration.

25:12.106 --> 25:14.606
I don't need one thing to distract me.

25:15.668 --> 25:17.465
Let alone six.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.477

25:24.855 --> 25:27.348

27:28.899 --> 27:31.563
Oh, you always have
an interesting way of saying 'hello'.

27:31.935 --> 27:35.364
As I remember, you never
particularly dislike my 'good-bye' either.

27:35.786 --> 27:38.770
Well, one thing I can say about you
when you say good-bye,...

27:38.817 --> 27:40.481
you mean good-bye.

27:41.278 --> 27:42.739
Sorry about that.

27:43.410 --> 27:44.559
I don't know what happened.

27:44.614 --> 27:47.387
Ms. Lilah.
Would you OK this check, honey?

27:47.486 --> 27:49.143
Yeah, sure, Eddie.

27:51.166 --> 27:54.377
I can't tell you how many time
I want to just pick up the phone...

27:54.424 --> 27:56.071
Hey, Brew, you're gonna win tomorrow?

27:56.549 --> 27:57.666
I'm gonna try.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.612
My life was so screwed up
that day, you know?

28:01.706 --> 28:04.042
- Just... I couldn't...
- Hey, Brewster! Come on over.

28:04.347 --> 28:05.886
I'll be there in a minute.

28:07.446 --> 28:09.056
No, I guess what I'm trying to tell you.

28:09.095 --> 28:10.580
Come on, Brew.

28:12.438 --> 28:16.126
Why don't you go be with the boys?
And I'll talk to you later, OK?

28:18.192 --> 28:19.887
- Hey, Bug?
- Hmm?

28:20.012 --> 28:21.856
I got better idea.

28:57.802 --> 28:59.607
I relly have missed you, you know?

29:17.180 --> 29:19.375
- Here.
- All right. I got it.

29:41.674 --> 29:43.526
Give me half-inch.

29:49.770 --> 29:51.324
- Here.
- Beautiful.

29:53.996 --> 29:55.942
Give me another half-inch.

29:56.574 --> 29:59.301
Louis, go get those tires over there.
Come on.

30:03.523 --> 30:05.023
Start the clock, Harry.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.573
A car's coming.

30:19.581 --> 30:21.401
A car's coming.

30:49.834 --> 30:51.975
There cupping wheeler.

30:57.941 --> 31:00.723
- Someone is coming.
- All right. Slow him down.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.583
OK, what's the up time?

31:03.754 --> 31:06.403
Ten, nine, eight...

31:12.204 --> 31:14.103
- What's that?
- Whoa! Hey!

31:14.509 --> 31:16.345
- Fire!
- We're gonna tell someone.

31:16.433 --> 31:19.128
- Hey, let's have another pitcher up here.
- Hey, a fire out there.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.637
- Fire?
- What? Fire? Come one.

31:21.934 --> 31:23.082
Time!

31:23.184 --> 31:23.715
Time.

31:23.778 --> 31:25.614
- Doc, they're coming.
- You got the tires?

31:25.653 --> 31:27.638
- There's wild bash...
- You're not gonna make it.

31:27.693 --> 31:29.325
Just give me ten seconds.

31:32.749 --> 31:33.733
Jesus!

31:34.014 --> 31:35.647
Here.
Give me a hand.

31:36.749 --> 31:37.631
Come on.

31:38.163 --> 31:40.562
It sure is lucky that fire
didn't get near our cars.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.788
Or we all will be running
around that track tomorrow.

31:42.891 --> 31:44.383
How did it get started?

31:44.773 --> 31:48.195
Probably, some drunk cowboy put
the button in the dumpster.

31:49.909 --> 31:52.142
Well, excuse us boys, but...

31:52.213 --> 31:55.393
this man needs a good meal
and a place to lay his pretty head.

31:55.823 --> 31:57.463
Yeah, excuse us boys.

32:01.885 --> 32:03.901
- Put its main frame
- Right.

32:03.971 --> 32:06.745
And you left six kids
in the middle of nowhere?

32:07.002 --> 32:09.737
No, I wouldn't call
a motel middle of nowhere.

32:10.026 --> 32:11.213
What you expect me to do?

32:11.331 --> 32:12.792
I don't know.

32:12.940 --> 32:15.769
If they were my kids, I really wouldn't
appreciate if somebody just...

32:15.824 --> 32:16.940
Honey!

32:17.558 --> 32:19.074
They're not your kids, honey.

32:19.425 --> 32:21.589
I know.
And certainly, not my kids.

32:21.896 --> 32:26.396
My God, can you imagine people
on the road with six kids?

32:27.435 --> 32:29.576
I can't even take care of myself.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.522
Yeah, well, I know that.

32:31.814 --> 32:32.955
Look at me.

32:33.978 --> 32:35.588
Do I look like a father to you?

32:35.713 --> 32:36.822
Uh-huh.

32:37.197 --> 32:40.056
Maybe, because you look like
everything to me.

33:47.212 --> 33:49.134
Hey, Brew!
Wake up.

33:53.337 --> 33:54.743
I'm coming.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.413
- Our cars had been stripped.
- What?

33:59.467 --> 34:03.147
They got Stan's new tires, they got
my gearbox, they got Hank's carburetor.

34:03.273 --> 34:04.601
- I'll be right out.
- Brew.

34:04.763 --> 34:06.317
You've been hit real bad.

34:06.458 --> 34:07.497
Be right out.

34:07.802 --> 34:11.809
Yes, I know-I know the same little bastards
to try to get even with me.

34:16.489 --> 34:17.670
Brewster?

34:17.855 --> 34:19.949
I've ever found the skunk who'd done it,

34:20.058 --> 34:22.848
I'm gonna bend monkey
wrench over his brain pan.

34:22.949 --> 34:26.105
Well, whoever ripped us off is
half way to New Orleans by now.

34:26.489 --> 34:28.121
I don't know about you guys, but...

34:28.301 --> 34:31.512
if I don't hustle up some parts,
I'll be watching this race from the stands.

34:31.676 --> 34:32.973
See you guys later.

34:33.081 --> 34:34.684
- All right, Brewy.
- So long, Brew.

34:45.967 --> 34:48.217
What the hell you think you're doing?

34:48.936 --> 34:51.530
We just thought we got your car
back in shape before we left.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.085
At the least we can do.

34:53.327 --> 34:56.632
I don't suppose it daunts on you,
people are making a living on these?

34:57.014 --> 34:59.038
I mean, what if somebody
stole your partools?

34:59.164 --> 35:00.289
Someone once did.

35:00.351 --> 35:02.164
Oh, when these guys
find out what you've done.

35:02.252 --> 35:03.892
They'll never know it was you.

35:03.946 --> 35:06.228
Those stupid son-of-a-bitch
aren't that smart.

35:06.291 --> 35:08.478
So far as they know, you got stripped too.

35:08.556 --> 35:09.330
Look guys.

35:09.416 --> 35:10.653
- Breezy.
- Heather.

35:10.787 --> 35:12.552
You guys were gonna leave last night.

35:12.771 --> 35:14.521
Adios, good-bye, farewell.

35:14.669 --> 35:16.099
That was our deal, remember that?

35:16.154 --> 35:18.240
We don't make deal with ex-cons.

35:18.406 --> 35:20.563
We all only try to help.

35:23.359 --> 35:26.219
Well, can't give the parts back.

35:27.093 --> 35:30.476
Maybe, I can sell them to get the guys
some money somehow.

35:33.695 --> 35:35.422
So, out.
Every body out.

35:35.476 --> 35:37.422
Could you at least take us
to the interstate?

35:37.508 --> 35:39.110
We can hitch from there.

35:41.086 --> 35:43.031
I'll take you to the interstate.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.578
But, I gotta get rid of these parts first.

36:06.182 --> 36:07.377
Over here.

36:08.415 --> 36:09.446
We know.

36:10.182 --> 36:11.041
Yeah.

36:22.862 --> 36:25.565
Just so you don't get any idea.

36:35.737 --> 36:37.057
Hey, Clarence!

36:37.330 --> 36:41.345
Hey, hey, Brewster!
Hey, man, where you've been hiding?

36:41.518 --> 36:42.807
I got some parts for you.

36:42.916 --> 36:45.447
Hey, that's good.
I can always do for parts for me.

36:45.478 --> 36:46.642
They're out on my van.
You wanna help me get them?

36:46.689 --> 36:48.916
Sure. Hey, come on in
while I get my keys.

36:49.064 --> 36:52.431
Where've you been hiding?
I haven't seen you in a long time.

36:52.502 --> 36:56.064
We were you racing in
the Baton Rouge those years.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.232
I heard about your crash?

37:02.466 --> 37:04.365
It probably scared me more that hurt me.

37:04.661 --> 37:06.708
Don't you get in a race after that?

37:06.838 --> 37:07.432
I almost did.

37:07.479 --> 37:11.409
I went out to California. I just ran around
on somebody dirt track out there and...

37:18.169 --> 37:19.544
Little bastards.

37:20.475 --> 37:22.342
You got anything else I can drive?

37:22.631 --> 37:23.631
Nope.

37:23.834 --> 37:27.014
I just sell parts.
I ain't got no whole car.

37:28.436 --> 37:32.084
I catch you later, Clarence.
I gotta find the way to track and fast.

37:32.741 --> 37:35.749
Clarence! Can you give
me a hand over here?

37:37.007 --> 37:38.437
Clarence.

37:39.507 --> 37:42.226
I got a funniest feeling,
he's gonna need that.

38:36.338 --> 38:37.338
Hey, thanks.

38:37.659 --> 38:39.635
- How about a ride to the track?
- Sure, hop in.

38:39.697 --> 38:42.159
Dog don't bite.
He's friendly.

39:07.635 --> 39:09.853
<i>We got a race coming up here folks.</i>

39:09.908 --> 39:13.548
<i>The best cars, the best drivers,
the fastest qualified...</i>

39:13.587 --> 39:15.275
- Turn it off.
<i>- in time we ever had.</i>

39:35.807 --> 39:37.924
Why, they sure came through for you there.

39:39.632 --> 39:42.351
What Lilah sees in you,
I'll never know, Brewster.

39:42.617 --> 39:45.640
Hey, Brew. Whay do you pay
your crew with, all day suckers?

39:47.399 --> 39:49.500
- Hold it.
- Hold it.

39:53.946 --> 39:55.329
Hey, Brewster.

39:55.962 --> 39:57.384
What do you think?

39:58.188 --> 39:59.907
Hot, huh?

40:00.453 --> 40:02.875
I think you guys are
gonna get us all killed.

40:03.477 --> 40:05.852
Well, when you see those cars
parked in them crates there,

40:05.906 --> 40:09.024
we just naturally thought you want
to get started as soon as possible.

40:09.094 --> 40:11.352
See how you got your race
coming up pretty quick, right?

40:11.493 --> 40:12.110
Yeah.

40:12.289 --> 40:14.875
You see now your car got
screwed up like Hogen's goat?

40:14.954 --> 40:15.696
Yeah.

40:15.813 --> 40:18.188
You mean you guys have
those parts crated in here?

40:18.642 --> 40:20.595
We did have things come in as ordered.

40:21.681 --> 40:24.111
The driver let me sign.
I said I was your daughter.

40:24.220 --> 40:25.970
And nobody else asking any questions?

40:26.259 --> 40:29.369
There was some comment about you
and someone named Lilah. Who's Lilah?

40:29.502 --> 40:30.767
Lilah's friend of mine.

40:31.283 --> 40:32.502
That's what we figured.

40:33.314 --> 40:35.454
Come on, Brew.
Why don't you take her out for qualifying?

40:35.518 --> 40:36.362
Yeah.

40:36.689 --> 40:39.643
You said you want to make
a come back. This car is hot.

40:39.846 --> 40:41.049
I'll say it is.

40:42.112 --> 40:43.963
If you have, Brew, you got a chance.

40:44.314 --> 40:46.948
Besides, you can use the prize money
to pay back your buddies.

40:47.033 --> 40:49.844
He ain't gonna do it.
I know he wouldn't do it.

40:50.001 --> 40:52.618
Yellow belly, gutless slob.

40:52.743 --> 40:53.782
Okay.

40:53.923 --> 40:56.314
Once and for all,
I'm gonna show you guys

40:56.353 --> 40:58.814
stripping cars and
fish bite fall in Arkansas,

40:58.900 --> 41:00.572
won't make it in a Louisiana track.

41:00.642 --> 41:02.728
All right.
Out of sting.

41:10.993 --> 41:14.071
<i>I like to direct your attention
to the track now.</i>

41:14.453 --> 41:18.235
<i>We got car number fourty-nine,
coming out on the track.</i>

41:18.282 --> 41:20.517
<i>The driver, owner, Brewster Baker,</i>

41:20.564 --> 41:23.674
<i>back on the circuit after
two years out of competition.</i>

41:23.877 --> 41:28.346
<i>Let see if Baker can qualify on his
first attempt from the come back trail.</i>

41:28.620 --> 41:30.870
<i>The best time of two laps.</i>

41:31.299 --> 41:34.581
<i>Well, Baker seems to very determine
as he gets the green flag...</i>

41:34.761 --> 41:36.691
<i>Baker is driving a Chevy Camaro.</i>

41:36.933 --> 41:38.269
- Yeah.
- Come on.

41:38.690 --> 41:42.237
<i>High bid of qualified time
under 18 seconds.</i>

41:44.675 --> 41:48.745
<i>Time for Brew Bake's first lap,
15.42 seconds.</i>

41:48.819 --> 41:51.694
<i>That would ensure his spot
in the starting line up.</i>

41:53.002 --> 41:56.393
<i>Coming up, Baker's second flag now...</i>

41:58.037 --> 42:02.928
<i>Oh, Baker's qualified time is
17.38 seconds.</i>

42:03.387 --> 42:06.691
<i>He'll be starting back in the pack,
but at least, he qualified.</i>

42:07.646 --> 42:11.176
<i>On the track now is car number 101.</i>

42:11.341 --> 42:15.302
<i>The driver is Alvin Crowe, a consistant
winner here at Shreveport.</i>

42:15.357 --> 42:17.037
- How did she run?
- It's OK.

42:17.115 --> 42:19.279
That would qualify fifteen
in the field of twenty.

42:19.334 --> 42:19.966
All right.

42:20.045 --> 42:22.881
- Change the gear, we're running too high.
- We're running the five-ten now.

42:22.951 --> 42:24.522
Make it five-eighteen.

42:24.661 --> 42:27.935
Give it two bounds left in left rear.
The race starts in 30 minutes.

42:27.974 --> 42:28.849
Come on.

42:42.652 --> 42:48.215
<i>Get ready for the start of Dixie 100 folks,
the feature race here at Shreveport.</i>

42:48.372 --> 42:51.621
<i>The cars will take one lap
before the green flag.</i>

42:51.740 --> 42:55.732
<i>It's freak day for racing and
freak field of cars and drivers.</i>

42:55.874 --> 42:59.819
<i>You got Harley Crommer Nipol
with Stan Johnson next to him.</i>

43:00.515 --> 43:04.921
<i>And it would count upon the green flag,
folks, we're about to get under way.</i>

43:05.182 --> 43:08.315
<i>And there's the green glag.</i>

43:08.440 --> 43:10.478
<i>And the race is on.</i>

43:10.574 --> 43:14.479
<i>Johnson in car number thirty,
Keith Toricalvin in car number one.</i>

43:20.720 --> 43:23.423
<i>Ron Dawson in car number twenty-eight.</i>

43:27.370 --> 43:28.363
Time?

43:28.410 --> 43:31.887
18.2 seconds.

43:32.028 --> 43:36.981
<i>Car number 101 got the big challenge
by Stan Johnson in car number 30.</i>

43:46.752 --> 43:50.690
<i>Ok, Crowe in car number 101
is still in first place.</i>

43:50.847 --> 43:52.956
<i>Johnson in car number 30 in second.</i>

43:53.136 --> 43:57.793
<i>But, he is being challenged in every turn
by Ron Dawson in car number 28.</i>

43:57.887 --> 44:00.660
<i>Quickley in the 17 car in fourth.</i>

44:00.809 --> 44:04.028
<i>Joe's driving the Pontiac
number 53 in fifth.</i>

44:04.652 --> 44:06.567
<i>Ron Dawson takes the lead.</i>

44:08.637 --> 44:09.645
Time?

44:09.918 --> 44:11.683
54.9 seconds.

44:11.738 --> 44:16.324
<i>Folks, this is gotta be the most
exiting Dixie 100 in history.</i>

44:16.770 --> 44:20.372
<i>Brewster Baker in car number 49
has been moving up to the field.</i>

44:20.560 --> 44:22.669
<i>He's now standing seventh.</i>

44:22.764 --> 44:26.912
<i>Leslie Fermit car number 18 is trying
to get the grip on sixth place.</i>

44:31.598 --> 44:33.230
<i>Three cars are out of the race.</i>

44:36.129 --> 44:39.997
<i>Yes, the twin Rick Jones and
Rick Berk all out of the race.</i>

44:40.808 --> 44:43.409
<i>There's the green flag.
We have four laps to go.</i>

44:43.606 --> 44:48.067
<i>It's Johnson in the lead,
Dawson in second, and Crowe in third.</i>

44:48.223 --> 44:49.746
<i>And here is the surprise.</i>

44:49.825 --> 44:53.527
<i>Brewster Baker is up there
with the leaders in fourth place.</i>

44:53.614 --> 44:57.067
<i>An incredible ride for the man
on the come back trail.</i>

44:57.806 --> 44:59.806
<i>And we cross the finish line.</i>

44:59.892 --> 45:02.720
<i>Johnson has won here at Dixie 100.</i>

45:02.853 --> 45:05.720
<i>Dawson takes second and Crowe third.</i>

45:05.791 --> 45:08.432
<i>Baker is in fourth, Palansy in fifth.</i>

45:08.675 --> 45:10.800
<i>What and exciting race folks!</i>

45:10.901 --> 45:15.120
<i>And none of the drivers in the freeway
track was injured, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

45:23.799 --> 45:25.120
Great Brew.

45:27.933 --> 45:30.292
Son-of-a-bitch did
pretty good, didn't he?

45:30.448 --> 45:31.948
Did pretty good.

45:33.261 --> 45:34.980
Fourth place, you call that pretty good?

45:35.066 --> 45:36.831
You were great Brew.
You were sure fantastic.

45:37.628 --> 45:39.667
Thanks.
Hey, guys!

45:44.005 --> 45:45.802
Hey, you won Stan.

45:45.950 --> 45:48.130
Sure got tire of chasing your ass's bit.

45:48.278 --> 45:49.989
Hey, fourth ain't bad.

45:50.138 --> 45:51.833
How did he expect?

46:00.299 --> 46:01.213
Here you go guys.

46:01.315 --> 46:02.769
All right. Pay day.

46:02.839 --> 46:04.003
You know, it could have been a lot more

46:04.058 --> 46:06.589
if I hadn't had paid those guys back
for those parts you stole.

46:06.761 --> 46:07.761
What they have said?

46:07.816 --> 46:10.535
You guys are damn lucky,
they didn't call police on you too.

46:10.641 --> 46:13.015
It fells good having little green
in the pocket, doesn't it?

46:13.117 --> 46:14.649
The liile mind ties down.

46:15.453 --> 46:16.805
Where's your gear?

46:16.961 --> 46:18.336
It's inside.

46:18.640 --> 46:20.039
Don't you think you better get it?

46:20.102 --> 46:22.367
Brewster, you ain't gonna leave us here.

46:22.555 --> 46:24.055
Yeah, he's leaving, Harry.

46:24.258 --> 46:26.922
But, Brewter, we got to
stay with your car.

46:26.961 --> 46:27.672
Hold it.

46:27.805 --> 46:30.891
Shreveport was the end of the line.
That was our deal.

46:30.985 --> 46:32.969
And he keeps his deal.

46:33.883 --> 46:35.266
- Howdy Bug.
- Hi.

46:35.337 --> 46:37.141
Just come looking for you
and say 'so long'.

46:37.220 --> 46:38.657
He's good at that.

46:38.892 --> 46:41.345
Breezy, this is the Lilah
we've been talking about.

46:41.642 --> 46:43.712
- Hi, Heather.
- Hi.

46:43.853 --> 46:46.181
Hey, you guys want the
iceream cones before you leave?

46:46.837 --> 46:49.095
- These kids are good machanics.
- Humm.

46:49.195 --> 46:50.062
I know.

46:50.226 --> 46:52.226
Hey, what did you say
your relatives are from?

46:52.679 --> 46:54.187
All over.

46:55.390 --> 46:57.054
Eight chocolate chips, please.

46:57.118 --> 46:58.657
Make mine a banana split.

46:58.743 --> 47:00.227
Add some large nuts, please.

47:00.836 --> 47:02.891
Any other guys want banana split?

47:04.577 --> 47:06.881
Oh, come on, guys.
Cheer up.

47:07.163 --> 47:08.326
Hey, I got an idea.

47:08.381 --> 47:10.131
I'll take you to the airport,
put you on an airplane,

47:10.171 --> 47:12.038
buy you tickets
to see your relatives.

47:12.528 --> 47:14.270
You know, I'm really jealous of these guys.

47:14.348 --> 47:17.449
- They got to go to Hawai.
- No shit, Dick Tracy.

47:17.621 --> 47:20.262
I bet that's the same mouth
you eat out of.

47:21.013 --> 47:22.817
Here's your cones.

47:23.013 --> 47:24.981
Banana split will be ready in a minute.

47:25.052 --> 47:26.567
- OK.
- Seven-eighty.

47:26.723 --> 47:28.387
Nah, just keep the chance.

47:28.505 --> 47:29.380
Here you go.

47:29.670 --> 47:32.037
Brewster, don't you want
to stay with us?

47:32.139 --> 47:34.779
Well, I like to, Harry.
But, what I'm gonna do with six kids?

47:35.022 --> 47:37.076
I'm not father material.
Tell him, Bug.

47:37.193 --> 47:38.764
You're doing just fine.

47:39.053 --> 47:40.685
We ain't get wait neither.

47:40.772 --> 47:43.451
Get the hell out of here.
We'll find our own way.

47:43.678 --> 47:45.178
Come on. Let's get our stuff.

47:45.279 --> 47:45.998
Wait a minute.

47:46.075 --> 47:48.286
Does that mean you don't want me
to take you to the airport?

47:48.357 --> 47:50.482
At least, the son-of-a-bitch can hear.

47:50.584 --> 47:52.216
Hey, guys. Come on.

47:52.302 --> 47:54.091
I'm really trying to help you.

47:54.209 --> 47:55.358
Tell him Bug.

47:55.662 --> 47:58.381
- Shove it, mister.
- Don't you talk to her that way.

47:58.459 --> 48:00.006
He's talking to you, mister.

48:00.444 --> 48:02.209
Oh, hell with you guys.

48:02.514 --> 48:05.045
Find your own way.
The airport is out of my way anyhow.

48:05.178 --> 48:06.561
I'll call you later, Bug.

48:12.632 --> 48:16.210
You no good, rotten,
washed up, fork tongue,

48:16.249 --> 48:20.788
black hearted, double dealing,
backstabbing, alci bum!

48:23.670 --> 48:24.983
Ok. It's OK.

48:25.288 --> 48:27.545
We could've been great together.

49:19.729 --> 49:21.487
All right, all right.

49:27.238 --> 49:30.183
All right, all right.
Every body is doing OK.

50:02.186 --> 50:03.944
Hey, Brewster.

50:04.131 --> 50:06.288
I think I know what your trouble is.

50:06.413 --> 50:07.444
What's that?

50:07.625 --> 50:11.430
Well, your caburetor ain't harden,
your generator ain't in it,

50:11.547 --> 50:15.547
and your piston ain't...
well, it ain't working either.

50:15.704 --> 50:16.922
That's real cute.

50:22.034 --> 50:23.636
How did those kids do this thing.

50:30.413 --> 50:31.983
Oh, no.

50:32.968 --> 50:34.046
It can't be.

50:34.140 --> 50:36.608
Welcome to your nightmare.

50:38.848 --> 50:40.950
Look, who's back.

50:41.208 --> 50:43.255
Bob Barker and the boys.

50:45.967 --> 50:49.662
We got no choice but to stick with you
till the better thing turns up.

50:49.904 --> 50:51.646
It's only way we can stay together.

50:51.756 --> 50:52.928
And Lilah agreed.

50:53.107 --> 50:55.107
- Oh, Lilah agreed?
- Uhuh.

50:55.295 --> 50:57.460
You want to correct her style.

50:57.795 --> 50:59.123
She sends her regard.

50:59.280 --> 51:00.147
She does, huh?

51:00.350 --> 51:02.866
What do you think?
Give us a chance to get this car going?

51:03.023 --> 51:04.874
- Please.
- Please.

51:05.015 --> 51:06.273
Please.

51:06.523 --> 51:07.726
Please.

51:07.831 --> 51:08.769
Please.

51:08.863 --> 51:12.558
Please. I can give you
piecing like old times.

51:12.994 --> 51:15.518
Last week's old times?

51:17.755 --> 51:21.192
Look, guys, if I do this.
It's under one condition.

51:21.528 --> 51:23.778
Nobody touches another's driver's car.

51:23.981 --> 51:26.934
I want no five finger discount, understand?

51:27.313 --> 51:29.876
It's easy.
No problem.

51:36.852 --> 51:39.539
- Terk, can I take your picture?
- Yeah, go ahead.

51:40.852 --> 51:43.211
Ahah hah. Well,...

51:43.500 --> 51:46.446
If it isn't the famous Brewster Baker.

51:46.628 --> 51:48.464
A bunch of midget for the pit-crew.

51:50.386 --> 51:51.785
Hey, sorry, Brew.

51:51.886 --> 51:54.674
I mean it's saddest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

51:54.799 --> 51:57.197
If you want the money,
all you have to do is ask, you know?

51:57.299 --> 51:58.963
The check book way.

51:59.229 --> 52:02.291
To see my old boss come to, uh,
something like this.

52:02.472 --> 52:04.198
Kiss off, mister.

52:04.253 --> 52:06.441
You did very well down at Shreveport.

52:06.691 --> 52:08.684
Like easy pop to what?

52:08.840 --> 52:10.708
Fourth? Huh?

52:11.176 --> 52:13.145
Must have been a lot of
dead meat in that race.

52:13.231 --> 52:14.700
Kick his ass, Brewster.

52:14.770 --> 52:18.098
Don't take that shit from
this fungus faced toad sucker!

52:18.372 --> 52:20.669
I'd tell the little punk there that, uh...

52:21.067 --> 52:23.755
he shouldn't be talking to me
like that if I were you.

52:23.903 --> 52:25.083
He's right, Swifty.

52:25.678 --> 52:26.748
Be polite.

52:27.389 --> 52:29.811
Mr. Logan here's a very sensitive man.

52:30.708 --> 52:32.396
On second thought, I got a good mind

52:32.443 --> 52:35.436
to turn this little kid loose and
let him just whip your ass, Terk!

52:36.139 --> 52:37.873
That's funny, Brew.

52:38.506 --> 52:40.818
Yeah, that's real funny.
That's good one.

52:41.647 --> 52:43.233
You know what?

52:44.358 --> 52:47.045
I'd look out tomorrow if I were you.

52:49.027 --> 52:51.308
'Cause I'm gonna be out on that track.

52:51.675 --> 52:53.894
Just waiting for you to screw up.

52:54.589 --> 52:55.816
Just once.

52:56.053 --> 52:58.428
If... you qualified, that is.

52:58.600 --> 52:59.757
Hey, Terk.

53:02.122 --> 53:03.490
Shove it.

53:13.325 --> 53:14.700
Who the hell is he?

53:14.911 --> 53:16.661
I don't think he lies you much.

53:17.138 --> 53:18.724
He don't like anything much.

53:19.036 --> 53:21.255
He don't like winning,
he don't like loosing,...

53:21.552 --> 53:23.028
and you're right, he don't like me.

53:23.357 --> 53:24.950
What did you do to him?

53:25.176 --> 53:27.817
Nah, it's not what I did to him.
It's what he did to me.

53:28.067 --> 53:30.685
See, he was my chief mechanic for a year.

53:31.271 --> 53:34.005
But, what he really wants to do is drive.

53:34.623 --> 53:37.740
So, he told my sponsors
I was loosing my stuf.

53:38.279 --> 53:40.349
And he played around
with my car a little bt too.

53:40.404 --> 53:41.482
You didn't know?

53:41.693 --> 53:43.568
Not until it was too late.

53:44.362 --> 53:47.666
He rigged my breaks
till it deak two years ago.

53:48.596 --> 53:50.565
I crashed into the wall.

53:51.101 --> 53:55.585
So, my sponsors dropped me and
conveniently picked up Mr. Logan.

53:58.258 --> 54:00.336
That's one bad dude.

54:00.689 --> 54:02.306
He's real bad.

54:02.501 --> 54:04.954
Shit.
He don't scare me.

54:05.095 --> 54:06.665
Oh, he don't, huh?

54:07.234 --> 54:10.719
Well, just the same we're gonna stay
away from the Terk, aren't we guys?

54:11.070 --> 54:12.938
- Breezy?
- Heather.

54:13.234 --> 54:14.461
Aren't we?

54:15.281 --> 54:17.320
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:21.476 --> 54:24.250
Oh, yeah, Brewster. You know
you're gonna need a new set of heads.

54:24.320 --> 54:25.836
You got a hair line crack in yours.

54:26.156 --> 54:27.758
That's two thousand dollars.

54:27.992 --> 54:30.195
We can make through
another race with those.

54:31.336 --> 54:32.500
All right.

54:33.490 --> 54:36.912
I know you guys may think that
grown men should not be frighten.

54:37.092 --> 54:39.647
I tell you, I was scare to death.

54:39.834 --> 54:42.116
It was the fastest
I had ever driven in my life.

54:42.187 --> 54:43.827
And we were side by side.

54:44.014 --> 54:46.983
And old Billy Flint
crashed through the wall...

54:47.210 --> 54:49.234
and was sailing out in this lake.

54:49.335 --> 54:51.804
And in this dark murky water,

54:52.116 --> 54:54.062
that we all knew had an alligator in it.

54:54.273 --> 54:55.664
Alligators.

54:55.837 --> 54:58.539
Then there come old Billy Flint,
just to gurgle in for air.

54:58.610 --> 54:59.595
And they stop the race.

54:59.696 --> 55:01.595
Holy shit!

55:01.743 --> 55:03.278
Then up come this man eater...

55:03.356 --> 55:06.028
jumping up with the head
the size of a shovel...

55:06.200 --> 55:09.817
and the body the size of washing machine.
I mean this mother was big.

55:10.010 --> 55:13.455
And there was a big swirld of black water.

55:13.900 --> 55:16.111
That was the last we ever saw...

55:16.275 --> 55:17.658
of poor Billy Flint.

55:17.809 --> 55:20.161
You know what we did find when
we pull his car out of the mud?

55:20.215 --> 55:21.215
What, Brew?

55:21.333 --> 55:25.231
We found alligator teeth the size of
cut silver dollars embedded in the fender.

55:25.379 --> 55:26.418
And no tires.

55:26.512 --> 55:29.973
I mean that alligator was so mean,
he ate the damn tires.

55:30.062 --> 55:32.147
- Yuck!
- Yuck, man!

55:32.210 --> 55:33.397
You know what?

55:33.538 --> 55:35.389
I bet that's why they made handbugs

55:35.429 --> 55:37.655
out of alligators from
this part of the country.

55:37.874 --> 55:39.187
I don't get it.

55:39.343 --> 55:42.381
Because of their rubber content.
That's what make them water proof,

55:42.498 --> 55:44.781
- you goons.
- Ah, we know you're crazy.

55:44.844 --> 55:45.750
I don't be lieve that.

55:45.812 --> 55:47.453
- You guys,...
- Ready for bed, every body.

55:47.517 --> 55:50.118
- How do you...?
- You guys believe everything.

55:50.228 --> 55:52.501
- Guys.
- Good night, Brew.

55:52.673 --> 55:54.110
Good night guys.

55:55.205 --> 55:57.791
- You need to be cool.
- I love it.

55:57.924 --> 56:00.322
Nothing better than a bunch of suckers.

56:02.894 --> 56:04.620
- Brew?
- Yep.

56:05.448 --> 56:07.636
Have you talked to Lilah, lately?

56:08.425 --> 56:09.769
Yeah, why?

56:09.956 --> 56:12.136
I don't know.
She's just real nice.

56:12.745 --> 56:13.769
Good night.

56:14.230 --> 56:15.378
Good night, Breezy.

56:36.001 --> 56:38.438
Hey, Brewster!

56:38.535 --> 56:40.137
Hi, Loni.

56:41.238 --> 56:42.949
I miss you around here.

56:43.261 --> 56:44.824
You miss anything in this place.

56:44.938 --> 56:47.704
Ha! They don't make them
like you any more, cowboy.

56:48.134 --> 56:50.383
I notice that.
And make me hungry.

56:50.509 --> 56:52.993
Yeah.
Younger and cheaper.

56:54.751 --> 56:56.595
You do anything later?

56:57.149 --> 56:59.080
Yeah, I'm makeing phone calls.

56:59.135 --> 57:01.025
You kidding me?

57:09.137 --> 57:11.191
Well, if you change your mind.

57:11.340 --> 57:12.926
You know where to find me.

57:39.262 --> 57:40.293
Hey!

57:40.449 --> 57:41.941
You're the famous Terkitch.

57:42.137 --> 57:43.871
Well, you've found him.
That me.

57:45.090 --> 57:47.035
My name is Bobby E. Lee.

57:47.281 --> 57:48.820
Thay named me after the General.

57:48.984 --> 57:49.852
Yeah?

57:50.242 --> 57:51.359
Tell me.

57:51.648 --> 57:54.586
What a pretty thing like you
doing in here this time of night?

57:54.711 --> 57:56.117
Bobby E. Lee.

57:57.151 --> 57:59.432
Well, it's just so hot and
muggy out tonight...

57:59.495 --> 58:01.511
and I was just dying for a cool drink.

58:01.659 --> 58:05.713
And I spotted you under the car there
looking so hot yyourself.

58:05.921 --> 58:09.780
And I said "Bobby Lee, you ought to
accept what for a cool one".

58:09.937 --> 58:11.781
Well now, this is my lucky night.

58:14.515 --> 58:15.906
Let's say, uh...

58:15.997 --> 58:20.059
we go to my trailer. I mean,
we'll pour a few beers and...

58:20.333 --> 58:22.067
I'll show couple of things that I got.

58:24.369 --> 58:26.165
- Ive seen you drive.
- Yeah?

58:26.259 --> 58:26.946
Yeah.

58:27.056 --> 58:28.892
And I like the way you shift your gears.

58:29.485 --> 58:31.501
I bet the girls can't keep
their hands off you.

58:31.619 --> 58:33.275
Enough of the Terk to go around, girl.

58:33.533 --> 58:35.470
Hmm, that's for sure.

58:46.593 --> 58:48.742
You stand here and watch the door.

58:59.653 --> 59:00.935
Here it is.

59:02.143 --> 59:03.744
He had the manifold, Doc.

59:04.924 --> 59:07.158
Stupid son of a bitch is
just making it easy.

59:07.260 --> 59:08.440
Give me a five-eight.

59:08.996 --> 59:10.581
All clear.

59:16.593 --> 59:18.382
That's one hell of the tattoo.

59:18.593 --> 59:19.585
Yeah.

59:23.289 --> 59:24.992
Bobby E. Lee.

59:25.149 --> 59:26.055
Uh-huh.

59:26.275 --> 59:27.408
It's cute name.

59:32.495 --> 59:33.823
What was that?

59:34.456 --> 59:35.995
I didn't hear nothing.

59:37.218 --> 59:38.539
Well, I did.

59:40.508 --> 59:43.133
I didn't hear nothing,
except the beat of my own heart.

59:46.905 --> 59:48.499
I better go check it out.

59:48.905 --> 59:51.882
Why don't you...
check me out instead?

59:56.336 --> 59:58.203
I do like what I see.

59:58.956 --> 01:00:01.932
Well, I just... help you out
this little thing, huh?

01:00:02.081 --> 01:00:05.073
Why don't I... help you... out?

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:12.220
Be my guest.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.829
I'm waiting, girl.

01:00:18.056 --> 01:00:21.165
Why don't we... go back there?

01:00:27.246 --> 01:00:28.887
I think that's good idea.

01:00:32.936 --> 01:00:34.491
Watch out.

01:00:35.014 --> 01:00:37.022
A mirror above the bed?

01:00:37.123 --> 01:00:40.069
I just can't believe my good fortune.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:41.717
- What's that?
- Huh?

01:00:42.545 --> 01:00:45.248
What the hell...
Ow, God...

01:00:46.436 --> 01:00:47.280
Damn!

01:00:59.964 --> 01:01:01.050
Damn.

01:01:03.215 --> 01:01:04.699
Go to the bathroom?

01:01:04.949 --> 01:01:06.496
You want a soda?

01:01:06.559 --> 01:01:07.715
- No.
- No.

01:01:09.629 --> 01:01:10.894
You go to bed?

01:01:26.456 --> 01:01:28.027
Shit.

01:01:31.315 --> 01:01:33.245
I thought you guys were
going to bed when I left.

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:35.854
Where did you go?

01:01:36.081 --> 01:01:37.097
We've been out.

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:38.722
- To movie.
- Bowling.

01:01:39.464 --> 01:01:40.995
Yeah, we were at the movies.

01:01:41.113 --> 01:01:42.957
- Yeah, we were just...
- Oh, really?

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.043
What movie did you see?

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.098
- Strong Man.
- Dracula.

01:01:45.145 --> 01:01:46.176
Don't give me that crap.

01:01:46.231 --> 01:01:49.090
You don't get dirty hands going to
the movies. Where have you been?

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.739
And just where the hell have you been?

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:52.927
You suppose to be here
taking care of these kids.

01:01:53.989 --> 01:01:55.966
Breezy, come back here.

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:58.345
What are these guys
doing out this time of night?

01:01:58.392 --> 01:02:00.978
That boy is seven years old.
He has no business...

01:02:01.056 --> 01:02:03.712
- Damn it, Breezy, I'm talking to you.
- Don't yell at me.

01:02:03.837 --> 01:02:05.298
What we do is our business.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:08.116
- What you...
- Brewster, don't be mad.

01:02:11.225 --> 01:02:13.600
You guys go inside.
I'm dealing with your sister right now.

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.100
I'll be back and talk to you.

01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:16.413
You get in bed.

01:02:16.952 --> 01:02:18.374
Breezy!

01:02:19.751 --> 01:02:20.907
Breezy.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.938
Breezy!

01:02:37.786 --> 01:02:39.888
Breeze, where are you?

01:02:43.021 --> 01:02:45.005
Oh, shit.

01:02:45.216 --> 01:02:47.286
That ain't no lie.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:58.822
You've ever done anything you're ashame of?

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:03.580
It's just...

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:06.283
I got thing inside of me...

01:06:06.471 --> 01:06:08.627
I can't stop, probably.

01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:12.181
Like what?

01:06:17.517 --> 01:06:19.806
Last night, when I was walking...

01:06:20.821 --> 01:06:22.892
I didn't even think about the boys.

01:06:23.124 --> 01:06:24.515
Not once.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:28.593
I kept thinking about myself. I want...

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:32.523
I want to be with kids my own age.

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:35.108
I want to go to high school.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.690
I want a boyfriend.

01:06:40.761 --> 01:06:43.448
I want...
Oh, you'll think it's dumb.

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:44.941
Oh, I don't know.

01:06:46.254 --> 01:06:47.496
Try me.

01:06:50.259 --> 01:06:53.267
I want... I want to be a cheerleader.

01:06:53.908 --> 01:06:56.447
I don't think it's dumb at all.

01:06:57.987 --> 01:07:00.581
Still don't want to lose those time.

01:07:02.729 --> 01:07:04.620
Those're good time alright.

01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:09.370
Do you think that's selfish?

01:07:10.622 --> 01:07:13.489
Nobody who has ever
seen you with those kids...

01:07:13.723 --> 01:07:16.278
would accuse you of being selfish.

01:07:20.326 --> 01:07:21.669
Brew?

01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:25.210
If I really run away last night,...

01:07:25.858 --> 01:07:27.991
would you be taking care of the boys?

01:07:35.472 --> 01:07:37.277
I don't know, Heather.

01:07:38.933 --> 01:07:41.183
Well, at least, you know my name.

01:07:50.572 --> 01:07:55.666
<i>In our 50-lap race with
35 cars all over the south,</i>

01:07:55.799 --> 01:07:57.588
<i>And now back, action on the track.</i>

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:02.096
<i>Buck Carter in car number 19</i>

01:08:02.221 --> 01:08:04.901
<i>and Ralp Barnes got tangled up
on that back stretch</i>

01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:06.510
<i>and now, we're under a caution.</i>

01:08:06.729 --> 01:08:10.401
<i>This Biloxi track always seems
to provide it share of thrills.</i>

01:08:11.392 --> 01:08:13.313
<i>Now, we're back on the green flag.</i>

01:08:13.377 --> 01:08:15.736
<i>Looks like Cater can
get back in the race, but...</i>

01:08:15.909 --> 01:08:18.970
<i>Barnes is going to have to watch
the rest of the race from the infield.</i>

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:21.362
<i>Go!</i>

01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:24.557
<i>Brewster Baker is making a move now,
bringing his car all the way</i>

01:08:24.604 --> 01:08:27.845
<i>from ninth position to challenge
Terk Logan for third place.</i>

01:08:28.236 --> 01:08:33.135
<i>Baker is in car number 49,
Logan in car number 73.</i>

01:08:33.339 --> 01:08:35.791
<i>Still out front is 30th car
of Billy Johnson</i>

01:08:35.885 --> 01:08:37.917
<i>with Johnny Dolenvack in close second.</i>

01:08:39.104 --> 01:08:42.026
<i>Baker makes his move
to pass Logan in car 73.</i>

01:08:42.127 --> 01:08:43.658
<i>But, Logan cuts him off.</i>

01:08:44.682 --> 01:08:47.501
<i>They race side by side in the turn 1.</i>

01:08:48.165 --> 01:08:51.180
<i>Big stroke in ths race folks,
just for the third place.</i>

01:08:52.283 --> 01:08:55.220
<i>Logan and Baker are upon
each other coming out of turn 2.</i>

01:08:55.307 --> 01:08:57.736
<i>Now they bump head
in front of the grand stand.</i>

01:08:58.243 --> 01:08:59.853
<i>Billy Johnson has gotten the lead,</i>

01:08:59.916 --> 01:09:02.197
<i>Baker and Logan continue
challenging each other</i>

01:09:02.243 --> 01:09:04.189
<i>all the way down that stretchway.</i>

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:07.024
<i>You're gonna have a family
fortune bet on this one</i>

01:09:07.095 --> 01:09:09.899
<i>because it's gonna be
a real deal by the only way.</i>

01:09:15.191 --> 01:09:17.981
<i>Logan blows his engine
and he has to ready</i>

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:21.283
<i>take his car off the track
and into the infield.</i>

01:09:23.636 --> 01:09:25.528
<i>Billy Johnson is still out there...</i>

01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:27.551
<i>Brewster Baker in second,</i>

01:09:27.613 --> 01:09:30.348
<i>Johnny Dolenvack is third
in car number 14.</i>

01:09:33.716 --> 01:09:35.857
<i>Logan got out of his car.
He's all right.</i>

01:09:35.928 --> 01:09:38.810
<i>Bt, he's one frustrating driver,
since everything was going...</i>

01:09:38.906 --> 01:09:40.961
I'm gonna get you Baker.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:42.703
<i>Checker flag is...</i>

01:09:46.506 --> 01:09:49.560
<i>And that's full of races for today, folks.</i>

01:09:50.071 --> 01:09:52.571
<i>And see you all next Saturday at 2 O'Clock.</i>

01:09:52.679 --> 01:09:54.015
<i>Gates open at 10.</i>

01:09:54.421 --> 01:09:57.030
<i>Bye now.
Drive careful, you hear?</i>

01:09:57.952 --> 01:09:59.670
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

01:09:59.835 --> 01:10:01.585
You fat thack!

01:10:03.948 --> 01:10:05.541
Swifty, get Terk.

01:10:05.651 --> 01:10:08.401
Get away.
Kids, let me have him.

01:10:08.534 --> 01:10:09.541
Get up.

01:10:09.627 --> 01:10:10.987
- Kick him.
- Get out of the way.

01:10:11.065 --> 01:10:12.683
- Kick him where...
- Bastard!

01:10:12.761 --> 01:10:13.893
Kick him, on his leg.

01:10:14.362 --> 01:10:15.472
Get on him Louis.

01:10:15.526 --> 01:10:16.463
- Louis!
- Bite him.

01:10:16.581 --> 01:10:19.269
- Shit!
- Get off my back, Louis.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.980
- Get him.
- Get them off me!

01:10:21.059 --> 01:10:22.652
- Get the kids out of here.
- Kick him.

01:10:22.746 --> 01:10:24.097
Get you Baker

01:10:24.168 --> 01:10:25.996
- Come on.
- Get him, Brewster. Hurry up.

01:10:26.067 --> 01:10:27.145
- Brew!
- Turky!

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.435
Get you Baker.
You...

01:10:29.122 --> 01:10:30.466
- Come on.
- Easy, come on.

01:10:31.302 --> 01:10:32.833
- Take it easy.
- Let go of me.

01:10:32.903 --> 01:10:33.958
- Come on.
- Hey!.

01:10:40.122 --> 01:10:40.778
Brewster.

01:10:40.817 --> 01:10:42.418
They showed up my car last night.

01:10:42.497 --> 01:10:43.906
You and rat cracks.

01:10:43.968 --> 01:10:45.718
Chicken, blacky egg sucker.

01:10:45.851 --> 01:10:47.437
Bobby Lee, huh?

01:10:48.312 --> 01:10:50.406
Well, we can take to you, Baker.

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:52.859
Where we can park you into a space, right?

01:10:52.992 --> 01:10:54.086
You son-of-a-bitch!

01:10:54.172 --> 01:10:55.851
Boy! Where you learned to fight like it.

01:10:55.927 --> 01:10:58.130
You really nailed that slicky bastard.

01:10:58.232 --> 01:11:00.200
The look on his face and you cocock him.

01:11:00.349 --> 01:11:01.654
I loved it.

01:11:02.435 --> 01:11:04.638
So, let me make sure
I understand this now.

01:11:05.802 --> 01:11:07.325
Bobby Lee here...

01:11:07.802 --> 01:11:10.404
gets Terk out of the way while
you guys work on his car, right?

01:11:10.495 --> 01:11:11.792
Yeah.

01:11:12.331 --> 01:11:14.893
Just what did you do to his car, anyhow?

01:11:15.198 --> 01:11:18.034
Simple. We switched
your crack head with his new.

01:11:18.335 --> 01:11:20.648
It's only a matter of laps
before he blew it.

01:11:21.132 --> 01:11:24.046
Sure enough. Boom!

01:11:28.755 --> 01:11:30.520
You go back there, young man.

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:34.974
What is wrong with you guys?

01:11:35.536 --> 01:11:37.223
Who the hell am I talking to?

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:38.746
But, Terk's rat, Brew.

01:11:38.849 --> 01:11:42.130
Hey, stealing is stealing, Pal, and
I don't want to be any part of it, OK?

01:11:42.612 --> 01:11:44.088
I don't wanna beat Terk...

01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:46.315
unless I am the best driver
with the best car.

01:11:46.494 --> 01:11:47.869
Not by cheating.

01:11:48.276 --> 01:11:49.971
As for you, young lady.

01:11:50.174 --> 01:11:53.010
I don't want any more of crazy stunts
like you pulled, last night.

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:55.166
I promise.

01:11:55.836 --> 01:11:59.547
Cross my heart, hope to die.
Cat spit in my eye.

01:11:59.727 --> 01:12:01.610
If the bastard is lucky.

01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:04.493
And while you at it,
you can watch your language.

01:12:04.617 --> 01:12:06.695
You know what that sounds like
coming from a kid?

01:12:06.797 --> 01:12:08.415
Sorry, sir.

01:12:09.407 --> 01:12:10.438
Good.

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:18.486
Hey, Doc. Read me
the race's schedule for next week.

01:12:19.416 --> 01:12:21.455
See, uh, Kansas City?

01:12:21.572 --> 01:12:22.901
No, it's too far.

01:12:23.034 --> 01:12:25.269
- Watkins Green.
- That's too far too.

01:12:25.339 --> 01:12:26.877
Tampa, Nashville.

01:12:26.903 --> 01:12:27.737
- Hold it.
- Jackson.

01:12:27.831 --> 01:12:29.097
Hold it.
Nashville.

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:31.041
How far down does the Nashville pay?

01:12:32.267 --> 01:12:33.658
Down to fifteen.

01:12:37.385 --> 01:12:41.097
That's it, Brewster! Drive it 'till
you hear glass and smell shit!

01:12:41.246 --> 01:12:42.903
What you say, mister?

01:12:43.934 --> 01:12:45.410
I said...

01:12:45.927 --> 01:12:48.474
Where are we going, sir?

01:12:49.279 --> 01:12:50.349

<i>Looks like Baker is back for sure.</i>

01:14:09.877 --> 01:14:14.533
We're in the final lap for Gabbery 200
here at Nashville speedway.

01:14:14.682 --> 01:14:16.221
And now they get the checker flag.

01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:20.760
It's car number 49,
Brewster Baker in first place.

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.073
A Vodka.

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:26.346
Honey, Tina. Don't go down there.
It's kind of crude down there.

01:14:40.187 --> 01:14:42.070
The way I see it, we got half.

01:14:42.351 --> 01:14:43.461
How much is that?

01:14:43.523 --> 01:14:45.968
Well, we got 3400 dollars.

01:14:46.055 --> 01:14:49.641
And we need 6800.
That's 10% of 68,000.

01:14:49.805 --> 01:14:51.594
Read it again Steven.

01:14:51.859 --> 01:14:54.376
- I like the way it sounds.
- Okay.

01:14:54.632 --> 01:14:58.015
On rural route #2 outside
the Nashville, near school,

01:14:58.155 --> 01:15:00.538
it's a beautiful 5 bedrooms,
two and a half bathrooms

01:15:00.616 --> 01:15:06.843
garage, dining, porch, gas kitchen,
washer, dryer. It's a steal. 68,000.

01:15:06.929 --> 01:15:08.273
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:15:08.469 --> 01:15:10.226
If that car running good, we'll have it.

01:15:10.368 --> 01:15:12.352
OK guys. Let's wash up for diner.

01:15:12.447 --> 01:15:13.861
OK. That's it.

01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:15.868
Little Harry.

01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:18.079
What do you guys up to, now?

01:15:18.894 --> 01:15:21.113
It's just family power.
Nothing to worry about.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.847
Breezy, wait, wait.

01:15:25.699 --> 01:15:28.316
Come on, little Harry.
We'll be washing up.

01:15:54.969 --> 01:15:59.462
<i>And Brewster Baker takes
the checker flag in the Pensacola 215.</i>

01:15:59.524 --> 01:16:01.555
<i>Folks, we've seen the race today.</i>

01:16:01.845 --> 01:16:05.283
<i>Johnsman Tankerman and
Brewster Baker for the 2nd and 3rd.</i>

01:16:05.392 --> 01:16:07.306
<i>Roswell old Charlie's menu.</i>

01:16:07.369 --> 01:16:10.103
<i>Come on, take the menu.
We're proud of you, Cahrlie.</i>

01:16:12.456 --> 01:16:13.956
<i>That's our Roswell welcome.</i>

01:16:14.253 --> 01:16:15.495
That's really great.

01:16:16.128 --> 01:16:17.214
You're doing good.

01:16:17.387 --> 01:16:18.098
You're great.

01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:30.727
<i>I want you all here next Friday.</i>

- Besides what, Brew?

01:20:32.097 --> 01:20:34.003

01:20:40.742 --> 01:20:42.899
Nope, that won't be necessary.

01:20:43.274 --> 01:20:44.477
Why not?

01:20:44.633 --> 01:20:47.149

I'm sorry. There is very strict rule about
the age. You guys are just too young, ok?

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.626
Swifty, you'll be right here
at the fence, monitoring the signal

01:24:41.658 --> 01:24:43.361
and you two guys will be the lap counters.

01:24:43.424 --> 01:24:46.353

I need you there. OK?

01:24:46.635 --> 01:24:48.947

Oh, man.

Talk normal.
What's so bad?

How about Brewster?
He'll sign. He likes us.

01:25:48.661 --> 01:25:50.161
It doesn't matter anyway.

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:53.427

Hi, Brew.

01:27:01.322 --> 01:27:02.573
Howdy, Bug.

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:04.651
I was just trying to call you.

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:06.197
Yeah, I see.

01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:07.502
Uh...

01:27:08.057 --> 01:27:11.268
- I thought you weren't coming.
- Well, I want to surprise you.

01:27:11.369 --> 01:27:13.893
Well, you surely did that, honey.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.260
You girls know each other?

01:27:16.369 --> 01:27:18.377
No, but it looked like
we were related in a way.

01:27:18.479 --> 01:27:19.940
With working in the Honky Tonk?

01:27:20.025 --> 01:27:22.424
- Hi, I'm Deanna.
- Hi, hi, I'm Lilah.

01:27:22.588 --> 01:27:26.167
Well, I guess I should
be getting back to work.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:29.073
Godd night, Brew.
Good luck tomorrow, now.

01:27:29.237 --> 01:27:30.557
See you, Deanna.

01:27:31.861 --> 01:27:34.104
You're lucky you've been called a bun.

01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:36.401
Oh, no.
No chance.

01:27:36.659 --> 01:27:38.362
I only got one bug.

01:27:38.682 --> 01:27:40.768
Were you really trying to call me just now?

01:27:40.854 --> 01:27:43.487
I swear I was.
I know this looks strange.

01:27:43.674 --> 01:27:45.596
- Oh.
- Well, I w...

01:27:46.174 --> 01:27:48.901
I don't why I came here in the first place,
to tell you the truth.

01:27:49.018 --> 01:27:50.378
I hate these places.

01:27:51.126 --> 01:27:54.517
The truth is I'm not trying to be somewhere
talking to you, even on the phone.

01:27:54.657 --> 01:27:55.962
So, what are we doing here?

01:27:56.056 --> 01:27:57.361
Great round, Brewster.

01:27:57.582 --> 01:28:01.075
Did you ever expect you'd be back
in big time racing so soon?

01:28:01.286 --> 01:28:04.754
Yeah, Carl. I didn't do it all by myself.
Beleive me, I got a lot of help.

01:28:05.008 --> 01:28:08.696
You're talking about your crew,
the kids they call the 'Six Pack'?

01:28:09.195 --> 01:28:10.984
Yeah, the kind of work
they've done on this car,

01:28:11.024 --> 01:28:13.157
I think I my very well
have a shot at it this year.

01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:14.469
Great.

01:28:14.594 --> 01:28:19.414
Brewster Bake. A man who thinks
he's got a real chance at Atlanta 500.

01:28:39.534 --> 01:28:44.197
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:28:45.545 --> 01:28:48.506
Make sure these kids get
to the track by 7:30, OK?

01:28:49.210 --> 01:28:51.765
- Uh-huh.
- See you later.

01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:21.363
Come on, guys.
You want to move your truck?

01:29:23.519 --> 01:29:25.129
No, no.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:34.593
All right. Get out. Ahh!

01:29:34.765 --> 01:29:35.984
Jesus Christ!

01:29:38.767 --> 01:29:40.532
- All right.
- Let me play with him.

01:29:40.603 --> 01:29:43.243
- Hold him
- I got him now. Hit him, hit him.

01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:03.280
Come hee you.

01:30:44.585 --> 01:30:45.827
Look over there.

01:30:57.336 --> 01:30:59.470
Where the hell is he?

01:30:59.884 --> 01:31:01.813
I don't know.
But, I got a bad feeling.

01:31:01.985 --> 01:31:03.649
Don't say that, Doc.

01:31:03.768 --> 01:31:05.690
They're gonna be calling
the cars to start pretty soon.

01:31:05.716 --> 01:31:07.112
What are we gonna do then?

01:31:07.174 --> 01:31:10.815
He'll be here.
Brewster would never lets us down.

01:31:39.271 --> 01:31:41.028
Hold it. Wait, hold it.
Pull over.

01:31:41.131 --> 01:31:43.450
- You got it.
- Slow down, slow down. Pull over here.

01:31:43.513 --> 01:31:44.659
No wait. Hold it.

01:31:44.753 --> 01:31:46.722
Check him out, this guy.

01:31:47.589 --> 01:31:49.417
Hey, my man.
Where're you going?

01:31:49.511 --> 01:31:50.425
We run the raceway.

01:31:50.519 --> 01:31:53.198
Oh, the races. Yeah, we're headed
there too, man. Come on in.

01:31:54.472 --> 01:31:55.495
Come on, get on there.

01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:57.386
- I'm racing there.
- Yeah, right.

01:31:57.581 --> 01:31:59.472
- Sure, you are.
- Yes, I am.

01:31:59.628 --> 01:32:00.706
Yeah, right.

01:32:03.425 --> 01:32:05.035
Hiya guys, what time is it?

01:32:05.324 --> 01:32:07.738
We ain't have the time, man.

01:32:08.894 --> 01:32:10.074
Great.

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:15.255
- Whoa!
- Wanna hit, man?

01:32:15.419 --> 01:32:17.451
No, I... I never touch this stuff.

01:32:17.544 --> 01:32:19.685
Oh, that's OK.
I'll hold it for you.

We're at the 22nd run of the Atlanta 500.

01:32:40.997 --> 01:32:43.919
Temperature is right now
at the high 70's, sky partly cloudy.

01:32:43.966 --> 01:32:46.083
John, it ought to be
a perfect day for racing,

01:32:46.154 --> 01:32:47.637
and from behind the scene's drama,

01:32:47.677 --> 01:32:50.083
we have an ineresting
development in the pit, right now.

01:32:50.193 --> 01:32:52.805
Uh, most unusal story in years.

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:56.954
Brewster Baker, who's been off the circuit
for two years, has been burning up

01:32:57.024 --> 01:33:01.360
the smaller tracks for the last four months
with the help of the pit crew kids.

01:33:01.478 --> 01:33:03.536
Kids! Sixteen to seven.

01:33:03.615 --> 01:33:07.083
And we're gonna down in the garage area,
have an interview with them, right now.

01:33:07.146 --> 01:33:08.451
Brewster Baker and the Six Pack.

01:33:08.943 --> 01:33:12.357
Congratulations to the Six Pack
for qualifying seventh.

01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:13.654
Thanks.

01:33:13.803 --> 01:33:16.154
Is Brewster Bake here?
I like a word with him.

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:19.123
No. He, uh...

01:33:19.295 --> 01:33:22.185
had to go... go shake
the doo off his lily thing.

01:33:22.531 --> 01:33:24.070
He had to what?

01:33:24.679 --> 01:33:26.968
Umm, he had...
he had to take a piss.

01:33:27.031 --> 01:33:30.460
And that's the story from
down here in the garage area.

01:33:30.646 --> 01:33:32.216
Back to you in the booth.

01:33:32.364 --> 01:33:33.950
Well, there you have it John.

01:33:34.028 --> 01:33:38.052
Race hasn't even started yet, and
Baker is already in for a piss stuff.

01:33:39.412 --> 01:33:43.021
<i>All of the cars that finished their
NASCAR's inspection, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:46.795
<i>And the reverend Bill Bayes is at
the beautiful chapel service</i>

01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:47.920
<i>in the garage area</i>

01:33:47.959 --> 01:33:51.397
<i>where most of the drivers and
the race officials were friends.</i>

01:33:54.069 --> 01:33:56.351
<i>May I have your attention, please.</i>

01:33:56.495 --> 01:34:01.416
<i>Will all of the crew chiefs move their cars
to the sarting positions on Pit road.</i>

01:34:02.026 --> 01:34:06.604
<i>Also, all drivers please report to
the competition director, Bill Gazerway,</i>

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.565
<i>in the drivers' lounge at 11:30 AM.</i>

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:10.706
Number one.

01:34:14.026 --> 01:34:17.612
<i>We have 500 miles of car driving
in historical today, folks.</i>

01:34:17.690 --> 01:34:21.354
<i>But for the moment, we got some
really pretty thing to look at.</i>

01:34:21.433 --> 01:34:23.776
<i>I refer to the beautiful racing queens,</i>

01:34:23.847 --> 01:34:28.277
<i>Watson Mayhew and her corner
of lovely young ladies while waiting.</i>

01:34:36.918 --> 01:34:40.433
In that hole where Brew laid,
it looked like socket in the pulled tooth.

01:34:41.837 --> 01:34:45.595
Yeah, he probably searched trying to figure
out how did he got that nod on his head.

01:34:47.785 --> 01:34:49.809
What the hell?

01:34:51.988 --> 01:34:54.699
Little midgets try to bluffing.
He ain't there.

01:35:23.266 --> 01:35:28.251
<i>On the pos, from Mooresville,
North Carolina, Dale Earnhardt.</i>

01:35:28.853 --> 01:35:34.431
<i>Lining in the second spot, from Chesapeake,
Virginia, young Ricky Rudd.</i>

01:35:34.947 --> 01:35:37.462
<i>Starting in third, from Hyattsville...</i>

01:35:37.572 --> 01:35:40.040
Hey, Fred!
We don't have the driver here.

01:35:40.095 --> 01:35:42.064
He's coming.
I told you, he'll be here.

01:35:42.119 --> 01:35:43.595
- He better be...
- Two minutes.

01:35:43.757 --> 01:35:48.296
OK, you got your two minutes.
Then we'll move this car off this lane.

01:35:48.507 --> 01:35:51.562
<i>From North Carolina, Richard Petty.</i>

01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:55.734
Guys, I think it's time we ask the Lord
his spirit. I don't think he's gonna show.

01:36:01.676 --> 01:36:02.809
Lord?

01:36:03.817 --> 01:36:07.145
As you know, we ain't been good at all.

01:36:07.473 --> 01:36:10.832
We stole car parts and
we used bad language.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.192
You see now, we met
a very good man, Brewster.

01:36:13.356 --> 01:36:16.848
The Lord knows that.
Just tell him to get here quick.

01:36:22.529 --> 01:36:23.544
Brew!

01:36:25.661 --> 01:36:27.778
Come on, come on.
Brew, come on.

01:36:31.576 --> 01:36:33.147
Brew!

01:36:36.889 --> 01:36:38.706
Get my belt.

01:36:38.799 --> 01:36:41.799
<i>To all personels, please,
clear the pit road.</i>

01:36:41.963 --> 01:36:44.347
<i>Let's race in before
the start of this race.</i>

01:36:44.503 --> 01:36:47.948
<i>All personels, please,
clear the pit road.</i>

01:36:50.706 --> 01:36:52.424
- Yeah. Hi Breezy.
- Oh, there's Pete.

01:36:52.589 --> 01:36:53.605
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Breezy.

01:37:01.254 --> 01:37:03.519
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>

01:37:16.334 --> 01:37:19.709
<i>The starters are getting them
under way but high price cars.</i>

01:37:19.842 --> 01:37:22.171
<i>A fourty car field of the best,</i>

01:37:22.241 --> 01:37:26.773
<i>the fastest drivers in NASCAR
grand national racing.</i>

01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:28.749
<i>They're moving off down pit road</i>

01:37:29.028 --> 01:37:33.817
<i>A beautiful deployed field of the
supervision of the starter, Harold Cander.</i>

01:37:33.896 --> 01:37:36.357
<i>We got the official count on
today's attendants,...</i>

01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:40.944
<i>fifty five thousand,
four hundred and sevety two.</i>

01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:46.381
<i>At 5th gear, 60 miles an hour,
these cars appear to be crawling.</i>

01:37:47.632 --> 01:37:51.694
<i>Now, the race cars move down
over the fourth turn bunny.</i>

01:37:51.826 --> 01:37:54.255
<i>And it looks like we're
gonna have a starter.</i>

01:37:55.045 --> 01:37:56.467
<i>And we have a starter.</i>

01:37:57.141 --> 01:37:59.852
<i>Now at turn 1 with
Dale Earnhardt in the lead.</i>

01:38:00.016 --> 01:38:03.313
<i>Ricky Rudd's right there beside him,
and the others are packed inside.</i>

01:38:03.384 --> 01:38:06.212
<i>Oh, what a great start
for this group of 500!</i>

01:38:06.349 --> 01:38:09.841
<i>It's Earnhardt, Kahne, and Ricky Rudd
running one, two, three.</i>

01:38:09.959 --> 01:38:13.638
<i>After that, we get Baker,
Logan, and Bill Elliott behind.</i>

01:38:13.795 --> 01:38:17.826
<i>There they are now. They are all
headed toward the turn number 3.</i>

01:38:17.921 --> 01:38:20.765
<i>Oh, we got a fume...</i>

01:38:20.913 --> 01:38:23.492
<i>Yes, that's car needs Sailor
with the blown engine.</i>

01:38:23.593 --> 01:38:25.804
<i>That's the first fleg in the afternoon.</i>

01:38:25.843 --> 01:38:29.225
<i>The drivers all hold their positions
right now while the dragon is cleared.</i>

01:38:29.405 --> 01:38:32.031
<i>Too bad for Silor.
Out so soon.</i>

01:38:50.587 --> 01:38:52.431
He's moving up!
He's moving up!

01:39:08.474 --> 01:39:11.724
<i>We're headed at 187 flag,
but if you check your score...</i>

01:39:11.787 --> 01:39:16.577
<i>Now the back stretch, we had car 46.
That's Ricky Round blowing the engine.</i>

01:39:16.615 --> 01:39:21.330
<i>The rest of the field maneuvering
around Ricky as we go to a yellow flag.</i>

01:39:21.597 --> 01:39:24.455
<i>You're gonna see all of
the cars checking in the pits now,</i>

01:39:24.526 --> 01:39:27.268
<i>while Round's car being
pulled out from the track.</i>

01:39:27.362 --> 01:39:29.557
<i>That's tough break for Ricky Round.</i>

01:39:29.612 --> 01:39:32.878
<i>Look like Brewster Baker
taking on right side rubber</i>

01:39:32.964 --> 01:39:36.464
<i>and fuel at very fast band pit time</i>

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:40.902
<i>Sam Pinsky at that corner
manage Baker's Six Pack for this race.</i>

01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:43.778
<i>And believe you me,
they're doing a great job</i>

01:39:45.814 --> 01:39:48.922
<i>And also it's giving him a great
boost by his Hawaii traffic crew.</i>

01:39:49.009 --> 01:39:52.157
<i>And now Logan and Baker both
move ahead a couple of notches.</i>

01:39:52.275 --> 01:39:56.205
<i>And to the 4th and 5th spots
with Logan having a slight edge.</i>

01:39:56.338 --> 01:40:01.516
<i>But the leader is Harry Gant with
Theodore Art in the 15 car challenging.</i>

01:40:01.628 --> 01:40:06.167
<i>Buddy Baker in the number 1 car has started
as they move through the slow traffic.</i>

01:40:06.301 --> 01:40:10.106
<i>It has time for that last lap
for 37 seconds flat.</i>

01:40:10.227 --> 01:40:12.703
<i>Here's Baker in the Ford
and Logan in the Buick</i>

01:40:12.751 --> 01:40:15.392
<i>And they seem to put up with each other.
They move up along later</i>

01:40:15.477 --> 01:40:19.462
<i>At this point, ladies and gentlemen,
you got only six cars now in the lead lap,</i>

01:40:19.547 --> 01:40:22.094
<i>all the rest of the field are one lap down.</i>

01:40:22.188 --> 01:40:25.040
<i>Adn you got seven starters
who are no longer in this race.</i>

01:40:25.294 --> 01:40:27.169
<i>But, you can count n one thing.</i>

01:40:27.333 --> 01:40:31.560
<i>And that is that all seven other drivers
will be competing at talent they got</i>

01:40:31.623 --> 01:40:33.918
<i>just two week's rpoblem today.</i>

01:40:35.948 --> 01:40:39.784
<i>We have 10 laps to go folks.
And this is close as they come.</i>

01:40:39.855 --> 01:40:42.472
<i>Buddy Baker is still the man to beat.</i>

01:40:42.568 --> 01:40:47.310
<i>But his lead is getting shorter every turn
by the number 3 car of Ricky Rudd.</i>

01:40:47.436 --> 01:40:52.451
<i>And tucked in right behind the two leaders
are cars number 73, the Hawaii tropic Buick</i>

01:40:52.505 --> 01:40:56.428
<i>driven by Terk Logan and
the 47 T-Bird of Brewster Baker.</i>

01:41:06.474 --> 01:41:08.793
<i>The lead changes hand on turn number 3.</i>

01:41:08.944 --> 01:41:11.061
<i>But, now the uno car's back again.</i>

01:41:11.168 --> 01:41:13.755
<i>The two leaders bumped on
the front straight away.</i>

01:41:14.256 --> 01:41:18.521
<i>They bump again and again.
Wait a minute, we have a terrible crash.</i>

01:41:18.603 --> 01:41:20.548
<i>Ricky Rudd slammed into the wall.</i>

01:41:20.588 --> 01:41:23.510
<i>Car number 94 truck
kicks Rudd from the rear.</i>

01:41:27.237 --> 01:41:30.799
<i>Brewster Baker and Terk Logan
who were running 3rd and 4th</i>

01:41:30.863 --> 01:41:34.105
<i>are now the leaders as
they are called in to the pits.</i>

01:41:36.435 --> 01:41:39.217
Come on in Brew.You're not tired.
We're gonna win it.

01:41:39.272 --> 01:41:41.092
<i>Only Baker and Logan are in the lead lap.</i>

01:41:41.178 --> 01:41:45.280
<i>So, the race is between Baker's Ford T-Bird
and the Buick of Logan.</i>

01:41:45.348 --> 01:41:48.950
<i>That was probably the worst crash
we ever had here at this speedway.</i>

01:41:49.028 --> 01:41:51.559
<i>But luckily, none of the drivers
involved in this crash</i>

01:41:51.614 --> 01:41:53.442
<i>got hurt as far as we can see.</i>

01:42:00.286 --> 01:42:01.926
Where are Breezy and Doc?

01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:03.629
We're gonna win it Brew!

01:42:03.708 --> 01:42:05.614
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

01:42:05.731 --> 01:42:07.395
Where the hell are the kids?
Damn it!

01:42:07.450 --> 01:42:10.278
That sheriff got them, Brew.
He's taking them back to Texas.

01:42:10.825 --> 01:42:13.895
Just go now. Go Brew!
Do you get it what?

01:42:42.972 --> 01:42:44.948
Go, damn it!
That's an order!

01:42:44.974 --> 01:42:47.394
<i>Terk Logan is down off the jack
and there he goes.</i>

01:42:47.434 --> 01:42:50.645
<i>Now, Baker is in the way. He's
catching up to Logan right over...</i>

01:42:50.958 --> 01:42:55.856
<i>He makes a hard left turn, cutting off
Logan who plowed into the pit wall.</i>

01:42:55.912 --> 01:42:57.755
<i>Both leaders are out of the race.</i>

01:43:00.615 --> 01:43:03.638
<i>We're gonna find out what happened?</i>

01:43:05.451 --> 01:43:08.177
Brewster! Brewster, come on.

01:43:11.203 --> 01:43:12.860
Not this time, boy.

01:43:13.125 --> 01:43:14.953
I'm in charge of my chargees.

01:43:15.086 --> 01:43:18.024
- I want those kids, sheriff.
- I just bet you do.

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:20.680
I'm on my way to Baker's car now.
I'll be there in a minute.

01:43:20.773 --> 01:43:22.930
Well, I got the red warrant
from the state of Texas

01:43:22.993 --> 01:43:25.110
and extradition papers
from the state of Georgia.

01:43:25.164 --> 01:43:26.250
pardon me, officer.

01:43:26.383 --> 01:43:29.383
Brewster, what makes you
take that wrong turn?

01:43:29.859 --> 01:43:31.656
Well Chris, I don't think
I took the wrong turn.

01:43:31.703 --> 01:43:35.719
I tell you, this sheriff here is from
the same hometown as my Six Pack.

01:43:35.829 --> 01:43:39.595
And he has driven all the way from texas
to arrest these six harden criminals here.

01:43:39.759 --> 01:43:41.204
How about that, sheriff?

01:43:41.313 --> 01:43:43.407
Look, I'm...I'm a Texas law officer.

01:43:43.438 --> 01:43:45.336
I don't have to talk
in front of no damn camera.

01:43:45.384 --> 01:43:47.289
Ask one of the kids.
They'll tell you what is going on?

01:43:47.344 --> 01:43:49.891
That sounds like a gret story.
How about some comments, sheriff?

01:43:49.954 --> 01:43:51.750
Can we talk about this in private somwhere?

01:43:51.781 --> 01:43:53.211
Oh, there is no need to do that, sheriff.

01:43:53.250 --> 01:43:56.813
We are on network TV with  the good
chance that the Governor of Texas and...

01:43:56.938 --> 01:43:59.781
the good people who elected
you to office are watching.

01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:02.242
And now is your chance to explain
to them why you come here

01:44:02.297 --> 01:44:04.352
to arrest these six little kids.

01:44:05.173 --> 01:44:08.391
Well, we-we didn't come here
to arrest them exactly.

01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:11.431
- Can I say 'Howdy' to the folks back home?
- Shut up, Otis.

01:44:11.751 --> 01:44:13.493
Well, what did you come for?

01:44:14.767 --> 01:44:15.712
Well,...

01:44:15.954 --> 01:44:18.407
we-we were sent to-to check on them.

01:44:18.493 --> 01:44:19.665
- Yeah.
- To check on them?

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.649
Yeah. See, these children are rophans.

01:44:22.751 --> 01:44:25.180
We have to make sure
they have proper supervision.

01:44:25.212 --> 01:44:27.103
Well, I can see they're getting that.

01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:31.954
So, I'm very proud to report to the
good people of the great state of Texas

01:44:32.487 --> 01:44:35.963
that these children are in
the capable hands of mister...

01:44:36.377 --> 01:44:37.807
Brewster Baker.

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:40.244
No shit, Dick Tracy.

01:44:44.147 --> 01:44:45.562

01:44:46.187 --> 01:44:47.335
