00:35.619 --> 00:38.042
No, I already called.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.129
Yeah, they're gonna send
someone in the morning.

00:41.333 --> 00:45.463
No, it was totally his fault,
which is probably the only good news.

00:46.555 --> 00:48.816
Oh, thank you.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.310
But I think I'm staying in tonight.

00:51.510 --> 00:56.066
I've got a hot date, you know,
with a bubble bath and a bottle of wine.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.274
Tell everyone I said hi though,
okay, and have fun.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.445
Okay.

01:02.646 --> 01:03.672
Bye.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.692
TGIF.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.939
My God.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.861
This is what I need.

07:39.876 --> 07:40.968
No!

07:44.130 --> 07:45.177
No!

07:48.468 --> 07:49.936
No!

07:54.265 --> 07:55.391
No!

12:11.940 --> 12:13.442
You were right.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.523
Oh, Christ.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.410
How could I be so stupid?

12:19.614 --> 12:22.283
Look, don't beat yourself up about it.
There's no way you could have known.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.960
Well, you obviously did.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.964
That's only because I saw him passing
notes to the little slut in study hall.

12:28.122 --> 12:31.877
And then Erik's seen them at disco
bowling last weekend at The Pins.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.920
- If it wasn't for all that...
- You're right.

12:34.128 --> 12:37.974
Then we'd all be fooled
by Mr. Dimples and Perfect Pecs.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.596
What are the assholes doing now?

12:39.801 --> 12:42.270
She teaching him the best way
to execute a mount?

12:42.470 --> 12:44.438
Oh, they're just having a great old time.

12:44.639 --> 12:50.232
All laughs and smiles
and perfectly timed hair flips.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.443
So gross.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.232
Oh, my God.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.400
What?

12:55.566 --> 12:56.783
I gotta go.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.411
You're not gonna confront them?

12:58.569 --> 12:59.991
I can't do that.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.622
- Yes, you can!
- No, I can't.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.954
You could, not me.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.373
- But...
- I'll call you later, okay?

13:06.795 --> 13:08.514
Oh, shit.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.282
Hilary!

13:11.249 --> 13:13.926
- Go to hell, Andy.
- Hilary, can we just talk about this?

13:14.127 --> 13:17.592
No, we can't, and congratulations,
you two make an incredible couple.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.260
Look, it doesn't mean anything.
She doesn't mean anything.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.929
You're my girl, Hill.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.101
Not anymore.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.073
Oh, my God.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.783
You're fucking kidding me!

14:40.463 --> 14:41.510
Hey, there.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.943
Hi.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.390
I am so sorry. Are you alright?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.221
No, I'm fine. What happened?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.514
It was the craziest thing.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.646
I took my eye off the road for one moment
to change the radio station.

14:52.809 --> 14:56.778
Next thing I knew... bam, you were
right on top of me from out of the blue.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.316
I really should've known better at my age.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.277
Again, so sorry.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.708
- Great.
- Look at that.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.460
Oh, my parents are gonna kill me.

15:11.619 --> 15:15.540
- Hey, this is on me. Entirely my fault.
- No. God.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.925
This is my mom's brand new car.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.298
Dammit.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.588
I'm sure they'll understand.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.381
Yeah, that would be amazing.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.425
But you don't know my parents.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.351
Oh, it's just a fender bender, right?

15:27.510 --> 15:28.978
Nothing too serious.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.564
I hope you're right.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.818
These things happen all the time.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.196
No, not to me they don't.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.439
Never, actually.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.279
This is your first time?

15:46.446 --> 15:49.957
Yeah. It's my first accident.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.665
I just got my driver's license.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.665
A virgin.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.502
Excuse me?

15:57.665 --> 16:00.544
When it comes to something like this.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.259
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.890
I should get a cake or something, right?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.063
So, should we exchange?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.603
Hm?

16:14.765 --> 16:17.143
Information,
should we exchange our information?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.611
- Yeah.
- No need to involve the police.

16:19.770 --> 16:23.491
Something as inconsequential
as this, right?

16:25.359 --> 16:26.360
No, I guess not.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.747
I'm sure they have bigger fish to fry.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.955
In this town, don't be too sure.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.005
I'm gonna be right back.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.368
Yes, me too.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.671
Uh, um.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.224
I think everything's on there.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.061
Looks great.

17:34.262 --> 17:37.106
I tried to remember everything
that they told us.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.608
Perfect.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.197
And for you.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.452
Oh, thanks.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.580
Well, alright.
Well, I guess that just about does it.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.040
- Okay.
- Oh, pictures.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.585
Excuse me?

18:01.789 --> 18:04.258
Um, they told us to take pictures
of the accident scene.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.920
All the damages, everything.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.843
Yes, of course.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.987
Um, I suppose I need one
of you, too, if you don't mind.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.068
Alright.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.541
You too.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.882
Of me and my car, I mean.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.013
That won't be necessary.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.095
Are you sure?

18:53.299 --> 18:54.925
Mm-hmm.

18:57.011 --> 19:00.606
'Kay, well, I think that's it then.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.941
I guess it is.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.573
'Kay, well, bye then.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.775
Goodbye, Hilary.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.442
Hey.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.731
Hey, oh, my God, Rachel just told me.
Are you okay?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.442
You will not believe
what just happened to me.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.623
The bastard dropped to his knees
begging for forgiveness?

19:54.785 --> 19:57.830
- I was just hit.
- Wait, he hit you?

19:57.988 --> 20:00.537
No, an accident.
I was just in a car accident.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.539
Wait, what? Are you serious? Are you okay?

20:02.743 --> 20:03.869
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:04.036 --> 20:08.542
It was just a fender bender, but, and it
wasn't even my fault either, thank God.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.085
Oh, my God. No, no, your mom's new car!

20:11.293 --> 20:13.421
And we're supposed to leave
in a couple hours, too.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.133
This is gonna be so bad.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.277
Yeah, it is.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.395
Well, thanks a lot.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.932
Well, let me know
if you need anything, hon.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.110
I just need to face this right now.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.118
Hola.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.037
Where you been?

21:20.237 --> 21:23.537
Um, just out for a ride.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.997
Just out for a ride?

21:26.160 --> 21:29.121
Why haven't you been answering your phone?
We almost called the police, Hilary.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.628
I know and I'm sorry.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.795
What's so important that you have
to sneak out so early in the morning?

21:36.003 --> 21:38.847
I went to see Andy.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.595
Oh, God, Hilary.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.098
Look, I know how you both feel about him,

21:43.302 --> 21:46.101
but I went out this morning
to finally end it.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.267
You guys were right.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.273
Everyone was right.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.231
And it's over now.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.864
Well, I guess something positive
came out of all of this, then.

21:59.068 --> 22:01.912
But that still does not make it right,
young lady.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.035
You're right.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.075
Well, let's not make a habit of this, huh?

22:06.242 --> 22:09.128
It's not like we don't have enough things
going on around here already.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.455
Help us pack. We gotta go.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.841
Check-in's at three.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.342
Actually.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.431
Something else did happen.

22:51.495 --> 22:55.879
Like they've never done anything wrong
in their perfect little lives, please!

23:08.971 --> 23:12.983
Your mother and I discussed this,
and after everything that happened today,

23:13.142 --> 23:15.941
we both feel that this is something
we just can't ignore.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.814
- Papa, I...
- Hilary, let me speak.

23:18.981 --> 23:22.406
I know you apologized, and that's a start.

23:22.568 --> 23:25.071
But actions have consequences.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.907
What does that mean, exactly?

23:28.073 --> 23:32.044
It means that you're not going
with us this weekend.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.374
Que?

23:33.579 --> 23:36.090
You're grounded. You're gonna stay here
and take care of you're mother's car.

23:36.298 --> 23:37.090
No.

23:37.291 --> 23:41.596
And I don't want you leaving this house
for any reason, mi entiendes?

23:41.795 --> 23:42.466
Mama!

23:42.671 --> 23:46.717
Lo siento, mijita, but we can't
pretend like this was all okay.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.305
No, but this is, this is our trip.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.018
The show!

23:52.181 --> 23:55.481
I've been looking forward
to this all year, you know that!

23:55.643 --> 23:56.940
I know.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.955
And that's why we feel that this
will never happen again.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.700
Please, please, I'm so sorry. Please.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.154
We left you the information
in the kitchen.

24:06.362 --> 24:09.332
I want you to take care
of it this afternoon.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.000
It's the least you could do
for your mother.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.384
Mama.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.759
Please, please don't go.

24:21.919 --> 24:25.014
I'll see you tomorrow night, okay?

24:25.172 --> 24:27.387
- Please.
- I'm so sorry.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.089
Lifetime insurance,
this is Davidson speaking.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.724
Hi, Mrs. Davidson, this is Hilary Diaz.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.977
Oh, Hilary, hi, sweetie, how are you?

26:35.135 --> 26:38.389
Have you been practicing
those day-boo-lays?

26:38.555 --> 26:41.100
- Wait, did I say that right?
- You did.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.694
- And I'm fine.
- Good, good, good.

26:43.852 --> 26:49.158
Actually, I am not so fine
at the moment, that's why I'm calling.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.818
Uh, oh, oh, no.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.076
Okay.

26:52.236 --> 26:56.056
I... I had an accident this morning.

26:57.458 --> 27:00.002
I was rear-ended at the stop sign.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.379
Oh, no, you didn't get hurt, did you, hon?

27:02.538 --> 27:05.332
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
- Oh, good.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.923
- It was just a fender bender.
- Oh, those are the worst, the worst.

27:09.086 --> 27:12.882
But my parents weren't too happy
about it, that's for sure.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.892
Oh, no, don't tell me
it was the new Sentra.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.348
Yeah.

27:17.511 --> 27:18.763
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.189
- I know.
- Oops.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.850
But, at least it was
the other driver's fault.

27:23.016 --> 27:25.276
- Okay.
- And I got all of his information, too.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.608
- Oh, good.
- Just like you're supposed to.

27:27.813 --> 27:31.116
Well, see, that's good.
Now, everything is gonna be alright.

27:31.316 --> 27:35.112
See, everyone gets into
their first accident sooner or later.

27:35.279 --> 27:37.907
At least it sounds like yours
was nothing too serious.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.077
So, you know, that's good, that's good.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.291
Yeah, I guess it could've
been worse, I suppose.

27:43.453 --> 27:48.008
Alright, let me just pull up
your family's file here.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.419
Okay, Diaz, I got it.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.087
The driver's name?

27:53.130 --> 27:54.247
Hilary?

27:55.299 --> 27:57.142
Hilary, are you still there, sweetie?

27:57.342 --> 28:00.642
Were you able to get the driver's name?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.099
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.356
That's okay.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.145
Jonathan Barker.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.280
Address and phone.

28:10.480 --> 28:16.283
312 Grinnell Street, Littleton,
Colorado, 80120.

28:16.737 --> 28:20.537
Phone, 303-555-6462.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.118
Ooh, out-of-towner, huh?

28:22.326 --> 28:26.126
Okay, plates and driver's license number.

28:28.332 --> 28:29.675
Sweetie?

28:29.833 --> 28:31.085
Uh.

28:31.293 --> 28:34.763
- Are you there?
- Plate 14SG69.

28:34.963 --> 28:39.139
Driver's license 063250331.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.766
And what was his insurance carrier?

28:44.306 --> 28:46.726
- Reliable.
- Reliable.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.654
Got it.

29:27.140 --> 29:30.144
How boring's this weekend gonna be?

29:30.310 --> 29:32.358
Huh, Harry Manilow?

31:27.302 --> 31:29.500
Ah, great.

36:53.545 --> 36:54.922
Oh, my God.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.506
Oh, my God.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.800
Oh, my God.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.240
Get it together, Diaz.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.244
It's gonna be a really long night.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.002
The hell?

43:12.298 --> 43:13.424
Going on, Harry?

43:14.759 --> 43:17.433
Getting all crazy up in here by yourself?

45:04.368 --> 45:05.369
Mama?

45:06.787 --> 45:08.138
Papa?

45:09.081 --> 45:10.082
Is that you?

45:14.879 --> 45:18.383
Did you guys decide to
come home early or something?

45:34.106 --> 45:36.279
Shit, shit.

46:08.307 --> 46:09.754
Hello?

46:37.378 --> 46:39.005
Alright, who's there?

46:51.392 --> 46:55.279
Be warned, asshole, I'm gonna t-ball
your freaking head off your freaking neck!

47:20.629 --> 47:22.225
Boo!

47:23.257 --> 47:25.100
Alright, ease up there A-Rod.

47:25.301 --> 47:26.393
Okay.

47:26.552 --> 47:28.099
Say cheese and pepperoni!

47:28.304 --> 47:29.977
Rachel, Erik!

47:30.973 --> 47:32.225
How did you guys get in here?

47:32.433 --> 47:34.276
Spare key underneath the fake rock.

47:34.477 --> 47:36.696
Yeah, three down, the left side bush.

47:36.896 --> 47:39.774
God, thank God it was there.
We would've drowned out there.

47:39.982 --> 47:43.027
- When did I tell you guys that?
- You tell us everything, sweetpea.

47:43.235 --> 47:44.987
I could've really hurt you guys.

47:45.196 --> 47:46.869
With your batting average,
I don't think so.

47:47.073 --> 47:49.416
You looks so freaked out.
You should post these.

47:49.617 --> 47:52.249
- No, I was freaked out.
- Right, let me see.

47:52.411 --> 47:54.305
Oh, my God, you should post those.

47:54.455 --> 47:56.583
Don't worry, I'll delete 'em.

47:56.791 --> 47:59.089
Wait, delete my pictures?

47:59.293 --> 48:01.136
Alright, let's eat this soggy mess.

48:01.337 --> 48:03.806
Of course, I always delete the bad ones.

48:04.006 --> 48:06.308
- Oh, music, we need some music.
- Hold up, will or did?

48:06.509 --> 48:10.054
Whatever you want. You can't have
nasty shots lying around like that.

48:10.221 --> 48:11.923
They'll end up haunting you forever.

48:12.081 --> 48:14.524
I hear that!

48:14.683 --> 48:18.270
You know, I once took a pic of myself
taking a dump in the bathroom mirror.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.026
You know, just like for shits and giggles?

48:20.189 --> 48:22.609
- And, uh...
- Ew, gross.

48:22.775 --> 48:25.907
- I accidentally sent it to my boss.
- Mr. Bessinger?

48:26.070 --> 48:27.947
Alright, who's hungry?

48:28.155 --> 48:29.577
Yeah, now.

48:29.740 --> 48:32.042
- Sodas?
- Diet please.

48:32.201 --> 48:34.078
Real sugar, por favor.

48:34.245 --> 48:36.296
- Hey, you guys?
- Hm?

48:36.497 --> 48:39.383
Thank you so much. Coming over tonight.

48:39.542 --> 48:41.510
Seriously, I really needed the company.

48:41.669 --> 48:44.513
Well, after the day you had,
Andy, the accident.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.890
- Andy.
- I know, I know.

48:47.091 --> 48:48.559
We figured you could use a little TLC.

48:48.759 --> 48:53.102
Yeah. Now, you PYT, you better
E-A-T before you waste away.

48:56.142 --> 48:59.567
Really, I should've known
when I got with him.

48:59.812 --> 49:03.945
I shoulda known that a day like today
was eventually gonna happen.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.325
Oh, should, woulda, coulda.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.486
You rolled the dice
with Mr. Fantasy Football.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.747
Came up double dots.

49:09.905 --> 49:12.954
So what? You're hot, he's not.

49:13.576 --> 49:15.704
His loss, big time.

49:15.870 --> 49:18.877
- Time to move on.
- Amen.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.961
Whatever happened to all the nice guys?

49:24.170 --> 49:26.093
Like when did that just suddenly change?

49:26.255 --> 49:28.758
You mean, non-douchebags
without bloated egos

49:28.966 --> 49:31.310
who don't feel entitled
to absolutely everything

49:31.469 --> 49:35.773
in existence and can carry on some
semblance of an intelligent conversation

49:35.973 --> 49:38.817
beyond that of professional
sports and/or video games?

49:38.976 --> 49:41.938
Yes, that. Exactly that.

49:42.146 --> 49:44.615
Yeah, sorry, gone the way
of the dodo bird, puddin'.

49:44.815 --> 49:48.823
Actually, they do exist.
They're just all like me.

49:49.045 --> 49:51.789
Oh, my God, that's so true.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.457
Straight guys are all such pricks.

49:53.657 --> 49:56.745
- You can say that again.
- Straight guys are all such pricks.

49:56.895 --> 49:59.796
- Here's to boys who don't suck.
- Hells yes!

49:59.997 --> 50:01.919
Ah, speak for yourself.

50:04.627 --> 50:06.504
Alright, what's for dessert?

50:06.712 --> 50:10.595
- There's some ice cream in the freezer.
- Mmm, perfect.

50:12.426 --> 50:14.474
Oh, cake!

50:14.678 --> 50:18.023
Oh, my God, so much better. Mmm.

50:18.224 --> 50:19.441
What is that?

50:20.726 --> 50:21.943
Sorry?

50:22.144 --> 50:24.613
Don't tell me Andy left this for you.

50:24.772 --> 50:26.115
Yeah, I think so.

50:28.901 --> 50:29.823
Maybe.

50:32.905 --> 50:35.454
It could've been somebody else.

50:35.658 --> 50:38.502
Oh, who? I'm intrigued.

50:40.412 --> 50:43.666
Well, the fender bender I had today.

50:43.832 --> 50:47.507
The other driver, I think
that maybe it could've been him.

50:47.670 --> 50:48.762
What?

50:48.921 --> 50:50.969
Yeah, wait, what? Really?

50:51.131 --> 50:54.010
It was on top of my mom's
car in the driveway.

50:54.176 --> 50:55.928
Why would he do that?

50:58.138 --> 50:59.435
I don't know.

51:02.726 --> 51:03.818
He texted me, too.

51:03.978 --> 51:06.939
- Hilary!
- Wait, how did he get your number?

51:07.147 --> 51:10.450
From the information that we
exchanged at the accident scene.

51:10.651 --> 51:11.777
It's what you're supposed to do.

51:11.986 --> 51:13.863
You give your name,
you give your phone number,

51:14.071 --> 51:19.202
you... your address,
like everything pretty much.

51:22.079 --> 51:26.255
Well, maybe he was just being polite?

51:26.709 --> 51:29.258
You know, actually sorry
for what happened?

51:29.461 --> 51:33.432
Believe it or not, there actually are
some decent people left in this sad world.

51:35.843 --> 51:36.935
Yeah, maybe.

51:39.138 --> 51:41.105
What else?

51:45.394 --> 51:49.274
Well, a little earlier,
somebody snuck in here

51:49.481 --> 51:52.860
and took pictures of me
in the shower with my phone

51:53.068 --> 51:56.163
and then deleted
the accident pictures, too.

51:57.281 --> 52:00.831
Okay, what?
You've gotta be making this up, right?

52:00.993 --> 52:02.495
Was it you guys?

52:03.579 --> 52:05.923
Are you playing a prank on me?

52:06.123 --> 52:09.047
Cause you were talking earlier
about deleting pictures.

52:09.209 --> 52:11.796
I won't be mad. I just wanna know.

52:12.004 --> 52:14.098
No, of course it wasn't.

52:15.424 --> 52:16.846
Okay, this is so nuts.

52:17.009 --> 52:20.434
There's gotta be a good
explanation for all of it.

52:23.766 --> 52:26.064
Were you expecting someone else?

52:45.913 --> 52:47.506
Maybe we should call 911.

52:47.665 --> 52:49.542
Yeah, I like that idea a lot.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.086
No, I've caused so many problems as it is.

52:52.294 --> 52:54.137
We'll take care of this.

53:01.095 --> 53:02.997
Who's there?

53:13.774 --> 53:15.902
- Andy?
- Hey, babe.

53:16.777 --> 53:20.114
- What are you doing here?
- Obvious, ain't it?

53:20.280 --> 53:21.748
You're drunk?

53:21.907 --> 53:25.286
- Like always.
- Wow, obvious again.

53:25.452 --> 53:27.375
You always were crazy smart, Hil.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.589
Look, you can't be here.
You need to leave right now.

53:29.790 --> 53:32.801
Why? Can't I see my girl when I want?

53:32.960 --> 53:35.759
Or do I need a fucking engraved
invitation or something

53:35.921 --> 53:38.470
to your lame fucking pizza party?

53:41.135 --> 53:42.637
You were spying on us?

53:42.803 --> 53:46.148
Come on, babe, how many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

53:46.306 --> 53:48.684
I am not your babe. It's over.

53:48.851 --> 53:50.652
I already told you that.
You need to go right now.

53:50.811 --> 53:53.781
See, that's not the way this works, Hil,

53:53.939 --> 53:56.943
because I say when it's over.

53:57.151 --> 53:59.612
Understand that? Me.

53:59.820 --> 54:02.243
Not you. Never you.

54:03.615 --> 54:07.044
What's this?
Supposed to be threatening or something?

54:07.202 --> 54:08.624
Listen asshole...

54:08.787 --> 54:10.889
Wow, see you got your poodles
here to protect you.

54:11.039 --> 54:14.009
- Who you calling a dog?
- You, bitch!

54:14.168 --> 54:16.717
What are you gonna do about it,
hump my leg or something?

54:16.879 --> 54:19.757
It's okay, you guys.
I'll take care of this.

54:19.965 --> 54:21.262
Your call, Hil.

54:22.634 --> 54:25.262
But I think we both know
how this is going to end.

54:31.977 --> 54:34.776
Yeah, see? That's what I thought.

54:37.691 --> 54:39.534
What the...

54:44.740 --> 54:47.334
I'm gonna spell this out
for you nice and slow,

54:47.493 --> 54:49.541
cause I know you're not
the brightest bulb in the box.

54:49.703 --> 54:50.795
You crazy bitch.

54:50.954 --> 54:53.252
If you don't get your juiced-up,
sorry ass out of here

54:53.415 --> 54:56.043
and leave me and my friends alone,

54:56.210 --> 54:59.760
then you can kiss
the homecoming game goodbye.

55:00.005 --> 55:04.601
It's gonna be really hard scoring touchdowns
with both your goddamn legs in casts.

55:05.469 --> 55:07.722
Get the hell out of my house.

55:13.811 --> 55:16.609
Whatever. Kiss my ass.

55:16.772 --> 55:18.240
No thanks.

55:18.398 --> 55:21.027
I already kicked it. It's much more fun.

55:23.195 --> 55:26.449
Ha, I'm scared of you.

55:27.032 --> 55:28.409
Yeah!

55:34.873 --> 55:36.250
Fucking bitch.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.515
Did you change your mind?

55:53.934 --> 55:56.107
So how are you gonna explain this later?

55:56.270 --> 55:58.147
Thought you said no more trouble.

55:58.313 --> 56:00.030
Uh.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.951
I tripped over it in the dark, right?

56:03.151 --> 56:05.949
If it weren't for my dancer catlike
reflexes, I would've been a goner.

56:06.154 --> 56:08.623
Yes, I like this new you.

56:08.824 --> 56:11.581
See, I told you there's a good explanation
for all that crazy shit earlier.

56:11.785 --> 56:13.628
It was just the asshole the entire time.

56:13.829 --> 56:15.422
Yeah, it looks like it, huh.

56:15.581 --> 56:17.800
Puts the creep in creepy,
that's for goddamn sure.

56:17.958 --> 56:19.130
Yeah.

56:19.334 --> 56:22.149
You know, despite his sociopathic
and stalker-like tendencies,

56:22.299 --> 56:25.766
I think it would be a shame to let
his lame attempt at apology go to waste.

56:25.966 --> 56:27.263
Right?

56:28.260 --> 56:31.434
I mean, that would just be downright rude.

56:31.638 --> 56:35.609
And besides, this is a celebration.

56:35.809 --> 56:36.935
Celebrating what?

56:39.229 --> 56:40.940
- You.
- Me?

56:41.106 --> 56:44.360
Yeah, to, um, to...

56:45.611 --> 56:47.329
new beginnings

56:47.529 --> 56:51.099
and clear skies ahead.

56:53.994 --> 56:55.755
At least tomorrow.

57:06.632 --> 57:07.884
Well, blow, bitch.

57:15.432 --> 57:16.934
Alright.

57:17.142 --> 57:19.019
Let them eat loser cake.

57:20.646 --> 57:21.942
Mm.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.243
Mm, mm, mm. Mm!

57:32.407 --> 57:33.374
Thank you.

57:37.913 --> 57:40.837
Mm, and this piece is mine.

57:47.297 --> 57:49.641
Mm, ah.

57:50.676 --> 57:52.178
Mm, oh, my God, this is so good.

57:52.344 --> 57:54.312
Uh, it kind of is good.

57:56.098 --> 57:58.226
Well, don't, don't tell that dip yet.

58:10.654 --> 58:12.873
It's probably my parents.

58:13.782 --> 58:15.034
Hello.

58:15.200 --> 58:17.248
Hilary?

58:17.411 --> 58:18.583
Yes.

58:18.745 --> 58:22.007
Hi, hon, this is Mrs. Davidson calling
you back from Lifetime Insurance.

58:22.165 --> 58:23.257
Oh, hi.

58:23.417 --> 58:25.252
I'm sorry to be calling you
so late, sweetheart.

58:25.419 --> 58:27.171
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

58:27.337 --> 58:32.179
It's just that, something came up
with the information you gave me earlier.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.561
You know the driver that hit you today?

58:34.720 --> 58:37.064
And I wanted to speak to you about it.

58:37.222 --> 58:40.647
It's something,
it's kind of strange actually.

58:40.809 --> 58:43.278
Um, is everything okay?

58:43.437 --> 58:47.658
Well, you know to be honest,
no, not really.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.159
Are you okay?

58:49.317 --> 58:52.620
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, fine.

58:52.779 --> 58:53.905
What is it?

58:54.072 --> 58:57.284
Well, the agent over at Reliable who
actually handles the person's account

58:57.492 --> 59:00.120
called me back personally
to tell me that the insured driver

59:00.328 --> 59:04.504
you know, who you told me
was named Jonathan Barker.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.964
- Yeah.
- Well, the account actually belongs

59:07.169 --> 59:10.298
to someone named Jennifer Barker,
a woman, Hilary,

59:10.464 --> 59:13.343
and there's really no way
to say this delicately, honey,

59:13.508 --> 59:15.476
so I'm just gonna come out with it.

59:15.635 --> 59:16.761
Okay.

59:16.970 --> 59:20.099
She was just found murdered yesterday

59:20.307 --> 59:23.277
at her home at the address
you gave me, matching exactly.

59:23.435 --> 59:24.311
What?

59:24.478 --> 59:27.439
Yeah, and all the other information
you provided, it checks out as hers, too,

59:27.606 --> 59:30.325
the plate number,
driver's license number, phone number,

59:30.484 --> 59:32.612
absolutely everything.

59:32.778 --> 59:33.779
Except...

59:33.987 --> 59:36.866
But obviously it couldn't have been her

59:37.032 --> 59:41.757
who gave it to you, sweetie,
so who was that man that did?

59:42.412 --> 59:43.789
Mrs. Davidson?

59:43.955 --> 59:45.551
Hello?

59:46.467 --> 59:49.090
Whoa, what's going on?

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.610
I don't feel right, I don't feel right!

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:08.154
Rachel, run! Run, go, go, go, go!

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:10.158
I don't feel right...

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:23.252
I've got you, I've got you,
it's okay. You got it?

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.302
Here, stay with me.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.257
You're fine, come on.

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.828
I've got you.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:45.187
Come on! Come on, come on!

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:23.434
Okay, let's go.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:36.196
Come on. This way.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:37.652
No!

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:46.412
Okay, come on, this way.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.872
Come on.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:50.503
I'm sorry.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:53.677
I've got you, careful now, careful.

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.391
Just stay here, okay?

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.608
What's happening to me?

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.408
It must have been the cake.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.911
There was something in it.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.529
He did leave it.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:29.334
Who... who... who was that?

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:32.291
- The guy who hit me this morning.
- Mm.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:34.175
The fender bender guy.

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:37.644
I think.

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:40.510
I think that's him.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.141
Rachel.

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:31.580
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.458
It's gonna be okay.
You just have to believe.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.911
You just have to hold on, okay?

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:39.203
Okay.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.748
But you have to stay quiet, Erik.

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:44.334
You have to stay quiet, okay?

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:52.228
Okay.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:54.254
It's okay now.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:56.140
Is he gone?

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:58.095
Is he gone?

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:02.555
Yes, he's gone. But we have
to try to get to the front, okay?

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:05.767
Out to the street. We have to try, okay?

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.269
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:12.944
I've got you, I've got you.
Okay, okay, we're okay.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.117
Shh, we're starting.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.321
Okay.

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:25.064
Okay.

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:27.379
Are you good?

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:37.090
No!

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:38.591
Erik!

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:43.424
No!

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:49.435
Erik!

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:03.745
Erik!

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:34.439
Why are you doing this to me?

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:38.026
Leave me alone, please,
just leave me alone!

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.744
Somebody! Somebody, please help me!

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:50.750
Come and help me!

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:56.256
No, no.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.573
Come on, come on, come on!

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:23.649
Not so easy now, is it?

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:32.974
Come on, asshole!

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:36.371
Come on!

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.117
Come on!

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.832
Come on!

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:36.764
Come on!

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:43.144
No!

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.111
Come on!

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.786
Dammit, you son of a bitch!

01:18:57.483 --> 01:19:00.282
911, what's your emergency?

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.157
Hello?

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:04.665
This is 911.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:06.871
Can you hear me, hello?

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:12.421
Dammit, dammit.

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:27.430
This is 911.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:29.940
- Hi, my name is Hilary Diaz, and I'm...
- State your emergency.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.536
Hello?

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:34.611
- Will you state your emergency, hello?
- Hello, can you hear me, are you there?

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:37.849
- This is 911.
- Hello? Dammit.

01:19:37.999 --> 01:19:40.572
Do you have an emergency to report?

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:45.781
This is 911.

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.842
Please state...

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:53.705
Your emergency...

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:58.262
Please state your emergency...

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:11.933
Oh, God!

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.267
Oh, God! No!

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.694
No, please, help me, help me!

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:18.940
Help me, please! No, please no!

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.913
Please!

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:24.199
No! No!

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:27.456
No! Please!

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:30.330
Please no, please no, please!

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:33.458
No, no, no, no!

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:43.596
Don't.

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:46.425
Please no, please.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.940
Please no, please. Please.

01:20:58.062 --> 01:21:01.111
My life, my life.

01:21:01.398 --> 01:21:03.116
Your life

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:05.444
is meaningless.

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:07.534
But your death

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.866
will be legendary.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:12.116
No, no!

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:52.142
Hola mijita.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.560
I just wanted to call and see
how you were holding up.

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:59.567
You're probably sleeping.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:06.281
We had a nice night tonight
but actually had a change of plans.

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:09.030
Your father begged me
to trade in the theater tickets

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:11.487
so we could go to the casino instead.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:16.163
You know how that's his favorite thing,
so we did that.

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:19.495
And he was so happy, too.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:25.843
But I have to tell you,
I couldn't stop thinking about you

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:29.343
and all that happened today.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:32.220
So look, I have a thought.

01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:36.766
This show isn't going anywhere
anytime soon, right?

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:39.564
So, what I was thinking was,

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.937
well, maybe we can make it back here later
in the month to see it ourselves, you know?

01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:46.613
Solo tu y yo.

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:51.781
And believe it or not, your father
actually won some money tonight,

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:55.367
so he can pay for everything.
That'll teach him.

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:01.917
I know how much you wanted
to see it, mijita,

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.248
and what it means to you.

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:05.631
Everybody does.

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:09.173
Besides, I'm sure
you could use the distraction

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:12.757
after what happened
between you and Andy today.

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:16.431
Not to mention everything else.

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:20.647
You can even bring Rachel
and Erik if you want.

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:22.774
We'll make a weekend out of it.

01:24:22.933 --> 01:24:26.687
You know, one that doesn't involve
any accidents of any kind.

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:30.983
So get some rest,
and we'll talk about it later, okay?

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:35.245
Te quiero mucho, Hilary. See you tomorrow.
