<i>Flight 784 for San Francisco</i>
<i>is now ready for boarding at--</i>

02:17.040 --> 02:21.477
<i>Inmate number 87645--</i>
<i>Cole, James.</i>

02:36.640 --> 02:39.871
-Jose, what's going on?
- Bad news, man.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.635
- Volunteers?
- Yeah. And they said your name.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.069
Maybe they'll give you
a pardon, man.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.914
Yeah. That's why none of the volunteers
come back. They all get a pardon.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.719
Some come back, I heard.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.639
Please put me back!
Don't take me!

03:07.080 --> 03:11.710
They got 'em up on the seventh floor.
They hide 'em up there.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.756
They're all messed up in the head.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.479
You don't know they're all messed up.
Nobody's seen 'em.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.869
And maybe they're not messed up.
That's a rumour. Nobody knows that.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.269
I don't believe that.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.277
Good luck, man.

03:24.360 --> 03:28.433
- Volunteer duty!
- I didn't volunteer.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.080
You causing trouble again?

03:31.160 --> 03:34.232
No, no trouble.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.909
<i>These are the instructions</i>
<i>for the first time probe.</i>

03:41.000 --> 03:44.788
<i>Listen carefully.</i>
<i>They must be followed exactly.</i>

03:44.880 --> 03:49.317
<i>All openings of your garment</i>
<i>must be sealed completely.</i>

03:49.400 --> 03:53.678
<i>If the integrity of the suit</i>

03:53.760 --> 03:57.833

08:43.840 --> 08:47.276
James Cole
cleared from quarantine.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.917
Thank you.
You two wait outside.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.673
He's got a history, Doctor.
Violence.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.955
Antisocial six.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.271
Repeated violations of
the Permanent Emergency Code.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.191
Insolence. Defiance.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.998
Disregard of authority.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.116
Doing 25 to life.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.350
I don't think
he's gonna hurt us.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.432
You aren't gonna hurt us,
are you, Mr Cole?

09:12.520 --> 09:14.397
No, sir.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.877
Why don't you sit down,
Mr Cole?

09:50.600 --> 09:55.230
We appreciate your volunteering.
You're a very good observer.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.437
- Thank you.
- We have a very advanced programme.

09:58.520 --> 10:02.479
- Something very different.
- A chance to reduce your sentence.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.676
And possibly play
an important role...

10:04.760 --> 10:07.228
in returning the human race
to the surface of the Earth.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.995
We want tough-minded people.
Strong mentally.

10:13.480 --> 10:17.917
We've had some misfortunes
with unstable types.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.958
For a man in your position,
an opportunity.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.878
Not to volunteer
could be a real mistake.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.599
Definitely a mistake.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.754
"Yet among
the myriad microwaves...

10:33.840 --> 10:38.231
the infrared messages,
the gigabytes of ones and zeros...

10:38.320 --> 10:41.039
we find words, byte-sized now...

10:41.120 --> 10:43.395
tinier even than science...

10:43.480 --> 10:46.153
lurking in some
vague electricity.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.356
But if we but listen...

10:48.440 --> 10:51.637
we hear the solitary voice
of that poet telling us...

10:53.520 --> 10:57.433
yesterday this day's madness
did prepare...

10:57.520 --> 11:02.310
tomorrow's silent
triumph of despair.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.870
Drink, for you know not
whence you came, nor why.

11:05.960 --> 11:09.111
Drink, for you know not
why you go, nor where.''

11:18.800 --> 11:20.870
Wandering around in nothing
but his underpants...

11:20.960 --> 11:24.236
and one of those plastic,
see-through lady's raincoats.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.949
So, they get there, they ask the guy
real nice for some kind of ID.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.998
He gets agitated,
starts screaming about viruses.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.196
Totally irrational,
totally disoriented.

11:33.280 --> 11:36.989
Doesn't know where he is,
what day of the week it is.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.196
All they got was his name.

11:39.280 --> 11:43.592
They figured he's stoned out of his
mind. Some kind of psychotic episode.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.797
- He's been tested for drugs?
- Negative for drugs.

11:46.880 --> 11:50.509
But he took on five cops
like he was dusted to the eyeballs.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.070
- No drugs. You believe that?
- He's in restraints.

11:54.160 --> 11:59.234
Yeah. Weren't you listenin'? I've got
two police officers in the hospital!

11:59.320 --> 12:03.518
The medic gave him enough Stelazine
to kill a horse. He's rarin' to go.

12:03.600 --> 12:07.354
That would explain the bruises, I guess.
The struggle.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.750
Yeah. You wanna go in there,
examine him?

12:10.840 --> 12:12.990
Yes, please.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.629
Is this all you have?
Ran it through your system?

12:16.720 --> 12:21.714
No match-up. No licence, no prints,
no warrants. Nothing.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.315
- I should probably go in with you.
- No, thank you.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.470
- That won't be necessary.
- All right.

12:27.560 --> 12:31.030
He'll be right here,
just in case.

12:40.360 --> 12:45.195
Mr Cole, my name is Kathryn Railly.
I'm a psychiatrist.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.748
I work for the county.
I don't work for the police.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.308
So my concern is for your well-being.
Do you understand that?

12:50.400 --> 12:53.358
Need to go!
Need to go!

12:53.440 --> 12:56.876
I can't make the police
let you go.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.997
But I do wanna help you,
so l--

13:00.080 --> 13:02.878
I need you to tell me exactly
what happened tonight.

13:02.960 --> 13:06.316
Do you think
you can do that,James?

13:06.400 --> 13:08.789
May I call you James?

13:10.880 --> 13:14.634
James.
Nobody ever calls me that.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.713
- Have you been a patient at County?
- No.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.679
- Have I seen you someplace?
- Not possible.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.753
I need to go! I'm supposed
to be gathering information.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.991
- What kind of information?
- Won't help you.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.072
Won't help anyone.
Won't change anything.

13:34.680 --> 13:38.389
James, do you know
why you're here?

13:38.480 --> 13:42.917
'Cause I'm a good observer.
I've got a tough mind.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.595
You don't remember
assaulting a police officer?

13:46.680 --> 13:50.639
Why am I chained?
Why are these chains on me?

13:50.720 --> 13:52.950
You've been in an institution
before, haven't you?

13:53.040 --> 13:56.077
- Or hospital?
- No! Now I need to go. Need to go!

13:56.160 --> 13:58.913
- Have you been in prison,James?
- Underground.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.718
Hiding?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.634
I love this air.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.554
Oh, it's such wonderful air.

14:08.640 --> 14:13.270
- What's wonderful about the air,James?
- Very fresh. No germs.

14:14.920 --> 14:20.392
Why do you think there aren't
any germs in the air?

14:20.480 --> 14:22.994
- This is October, right?
- April.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.834
- What year is this?
- What year do you think it is?

14:26.920 --> 14:28.717
1996.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.588
That's the future,James. Do you
think you're living in the future?

14:32.680 --> 14:34.477
1996 is the past.

14:34.560 --> 14:38.473
No, 1996 is the future.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.676
This is 1990.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.671
- Shut up, ladies.
- Where're you taking me?

14:48.760 --> 14:51.115
South of France, buddy.
Fancy hotel. You'll love it.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.760
I can't go to France. I just need
to make a telephone call.

14:53.840 --> 14:58.118
Yeah, yeah. Zip it, Daisy. You fooled
the shrink, but you don't fool us.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.677
Let's go, ace.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.074
All right.
Come on, come on.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.434
There you go.
Now, lemme see your head,Jimbo.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.990
- See if you got any creepy crawlers.
- I need to make a telephone call.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.834
Got to get to a doctor,Jimbo. Can't
make no calls till the doctor says.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.273
It's very important!

15:48.360 --> 15:53.718
What you gotta do,Jimbo,
is take it easy. Relax into things.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.792
And we'll all get along fine
if you just relax.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.275
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.914
Hey, Goines!

16:14.000 --> 16:15.638
Yo, Goines!

16:15.720 --> 16:17.676
Yo,Jeffrey!

16:20.800 --> 16:23.234
- What?
- Look here.

16:23.320 --> 16:27.279
This here's James. Now, do me a favour.
Why don't you show him around?

16:27.360 --> 16:29.794
Tell him the TV rules.
Show him the games and stuff. Okay?

16:29.880 --> 16:32.633
How much you gonna pay me?
How much? I'd be doin' your job.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.280
- Five thousand dollars. That enough?
- Five thousand?

16:35.360 --> 16:37.316
I'll wire a cheque
to your account as usual.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.717
I'll give him the deluxe
mental hospital tour.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.314
Kid around, makes 'em feel good.
We're pals.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.994
You're the prisoners.
No, you're the guards.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.798
Now you got it.

16:50.880 --> 16:54.395
Okay, it's all in good fun.
Here's some games here.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.836
And there's--
Get out! Get out!

16:59.720 --> 17:01.756
He was in my chair.

17:01.840 --> 17:05.388
Games. Games.
Here's some games.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.710
Games that wanna get out.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.359
See? More games.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.876
Games, they vegetize you.
See?

17:13.960 --> 17:17.349
If you play the games, you're
voluntarily taking a tranquillizer.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.876
I guess they gave you
some chemical restraints. Drugs!

17:20.960 --> 17:24.111
What'd they give you? Thorazine?
Haldol? How much? How much?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.270
Learn your drugs. Know your dosages.
It's elementary.

17:26.359 --> 17:29.830
- I need to make a telephone call.
- A telephone call?

17:29.920 --> 17:34.038
That's communication with the outside
world. Doctor's discretion.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.588
If all of these nuts
could just make phone calls...

17:36.680 --> 17:39.399
it could spread insanity
oozing through telephone cables...

17:39.480 --> 17:43.109
oozing to the ears of all these
poor, sane people, infecting them.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.839
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.

17:45.920 --> 17:50.471
In fact, very few,Jim--Jim, very few
of us here are actually mentally ill.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.710
I'm not saying
you're not mentally ill.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.713
For all I know, you're crazy as a loon.
But that's not why you're here.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.038
You're here
because of the system.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.877
There's the television.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.996
It's all right there.
All right there.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.957
Look, listen, kneel, pray.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.918
The commercials!

18:13.000 --> 18:15.958
We're not productive any more.
Don't make things. It's all automated.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.032
What are we for then?
We're consumers,Jim.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.873
Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff,
you're a good citizen.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.838
But if you don't buy a lot of stuff,
what are you then?

18:24.920 --> 18:27.434
What?
You're mentally ill.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.559
Fact,Jim. Fact! If you don't
buy things: toilet paper, new cars...

18:31.640 --> 18:33.278
electrically operated
sexual devices...

18:33.360 --> 18:35.510
stereo systems
with brain-implanted headphones...

18:35.600 --> 18:39.309
screwdrivers with built-in radar
devices, voice-activated computers--

18:39.400 --> 18:41.277
Take it easy,Jeffrey.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.635
Be calm!

18:45.200 --> 18:48.795
Right. That's right.
You're a very attractive woman.

18:50.560 --> 18:54.633
If you want to watch a particular
TV programme, like <i>All My Children...</i>

18:54.720 --> 18:58.349
go to the nurse, tell her the day,
the time the show you wanna see is on.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.590
But you have to tell her before
the show is scheduled to be on.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.990
This guy was always requesting shows
that had already played.

19:04.080 --> 19:07.072
Yes. No.
You have to tell her before.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.755
He couldn't grasp the idea that
the nurse couldn't make it be yesterday.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.035
She couldn't turn back time!
Thank you, Einstein.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.112
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake,Jim.

19:16.200 --> 19:20.512
Okay, that's it,Jeffrey.
You're gonna get a shot.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.239
- I warned you.
- Right.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.196
I got a little carried away...

19:27.280 --> 19:31.114
explaining the inner workings
of the institution to Jim.

19:33.920 --> 19:37.230
I don't really come
from outer space.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.914
Oh. L.J. Washington.
He doesn't really come from outer space.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.309
Don't mock me, my friend.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.439
Get outta my chair!

19:47.520 --> 19:50.478
It's a condition
of mental divergence.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.870
I find myself
on the planet Ogo.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.599
Part of an intellectual elite...

19:56.680 --> 20:01.993
preparing to subjugate
the barbarian hordes on Pluto.

20:02.080 --> 20:06.915
But even though this is a totally
convincing reality for me in all ways...

20:07.000 --> 20:11.676
nevertheless, Ogo is actually
a construct of my psyche.

20:11.760 --> 20:15.116
I am mentally divergent...

20:15.200 --> 20:19.113
in that I am escaping
certain unnamed realities...

20:19.200 --> 20:21.589
that plague my life here.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.673
When I stop going there,
I will be well.

20:27.040 --> 20:31.272
Are you also divergent,
friend?

20:36.680 --> 20:39.274
This is a place
for crazy people.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.477
I'm not crazy.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.393
We don't use that term, " crazy,''
Mr Cole.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.229
You've got
some real nuts here!

20:51.840 --> 20:55.913
I know some things
that you don't know.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.673
It's gonna be very difficult
for you to understand it.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.470
I'm not gonna hurt anyone!

21:04.560 --> 21:06.835
All right.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.356
Look,
have any of you heard...

21:12.440 --> 21:16.228
of the Army
of the Twelve Monkeys?

21:17.760 --> 21:21.036
They stencil this on the sides
of buildings everywhere.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.839
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?

21:23.920 --> 21:25.990
Why don't you just
take your time...

21:26.080 --> 21:28.514
and try to explain this
from the beginning?

21:28.600 --> 21:30.875
Right, right.
It's 1990.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.635
Okay, that makes sense.
They wouldn't have been active yet.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.995
Five billion people
died in 1996 and 1997.

21:51.080 --> 21:54.755
Almost the entire population
of the world.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.993
Only about one percent
of us survived.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.914
- Are you going to save us?
- How can I? This already happened.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.470
I can't save you.
Nobody can.

22:06.560 --> 22:11.076
I am simply trying to gather information
to help the people in the present...

22:11.160 --> 22:12.912
trace the path of the virus.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.551
We're not in the present now,
Mr Cole?

22:17.640 --> 22:21.394
1990 is the past. This already happened.
That's what I'm trying--

22:24.320 --> 22:27.278
You believe 1996 is the present then,
is that it?

22:27.360 --> 22:31.148
No! 1996 is the past too.
Listen to me. What l--

22:33.400 --> 22:37.916
What l-- What I need to do
is make a telephone call.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.152
I can straighten this out
if I make a telephone call.

22:42.240 --> 22:45.198
Who would you call?
Who would straighten everything out?

22:45.280 --> 22:49.558
The scientists. They'll want to know
that they sent me to the wrong time.

22:49.640 --> 22:54.475
I can leave a voice mail message
that they monitor from the present.

22:55.720 --> 22:59.110
Can I just make
one telephone call, please?

22:59.200 --> 23:01.111
Please?

23:06.240 --> 23:08.595
What are you doin' in the dog bowl?
Get outta there!

23:08.680 --> 23:12.150
Who put those Doritos
in there anyway?

23:12.240 --> 23:15.516
Yes? What?
Voice mail?

23:15.600 --> 23:17.830
Look, I don't know--
Stop makin' that noise!

23:17.920 --> 23:20.070
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

23:20.160 --> 23:24.119
Is this a joke?
I don't know any scientists.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.111
Duanne, get out--
James who?

23:28.880 --> 23:31.997
Wasn't who you expected?

23:32.080 --> 23:37.108
No. It was some lady.
She didn't know anything.

23:37.200 --> 23:41.239
Well, maybe it was
the wrong number.

23:41.320 --> 23:45.871
No. That's why they chose me.
I remember things.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.110
James, where did you grow up?

23:48.200 --> 23:50.156
Dr Railly.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.198
I have the strangest feeling
I've met you before.

23:53.280 --> 23:57.353
Wait. This is 1990. I'm supposed
to be leaving messages in 1996!

23:57.440 --> 24:00.000
It's not the right number yet!
That's the problem!

24:00.080 --> 24:03.595
<i>I have a message for them.</i>

24:37.360 --> 24:40.238
Won't work.
Can't open it.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.914
You think you can remove the grill,
but you can't. It's welded.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.710
See? Told you.
All the doors are locked too.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.109
They're protecting the people
on the outside from us...

24:51.200 --> 24:53.589
when the people on the outside
are as crazy as us.

25:13.400 --> 25:17.871
Do you know what " crazy'' is?
Crazy is " majority rules.'' Yeah.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.837
Take germs, for example.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.309
Germs?

25:22.400 --> 25:25.995
In the 18th century, no such thing.
<i>Nada.</i> Nothing.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.310
No one ever imagined such a thing!
No sane person, anyway.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.350
Along comes this doctor.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.154
Semmelweis!

25:37.160 --> 25:41.312
Semmelweis comes along, trying to
convince people, other doctors mainly...

25:41.400 --> 25:44.233
that there are these teeny, tiny,
invisible bad things called germs...

25:44.320 --> 25:46.675
that get into your body
and make you sick.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.274
He's trying to get doctors
to wash their hands.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.237
What is this guy?
Crazy?

25:51.320 --> 25:54.790
Teeny, tiny, invisible--
"What do you call 'em? Germs? What?''

25:54.880 --> 25:57.519
Now, cut to the 20th century.

25:57.600 --> 26:02.469
Last week, in fact, right before
I got dragged into this hellhole!

26:02.560 --> 26:05.358
I go in to order a burger
in this fast-food joint.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.158
The guy drops it on the floor.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.435
Jim, he picks it up,
wipes it off.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.556
He hands it to me
like it was all okay.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.712
"What about the germs?'' I say.
He says, "I don't believe in germs.

26:14.800 --> 26:18.759
Germs are a plot they made up so they
can sell you disinfectants and soaps.''

26:18.840 --> 26:22.753
Now, he's crazy, right?
See?

26:25.680 --> 26:30.276
There's no right. There's no wrong.
There's only popular opinion.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.794
You, you, you believe in germs,
right?

26:32.880 --> 26:35.599
I'm not crazy.

26:35.680 --> 26:40.515
Of course not! You wanna escape, right?
That's very sane.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.516
I can help you.
You want me to, don't ya? Get you out?

26:47.280 --> 26:49.510
You know how
to get outta here?

26:51.760 --> 26:52.909
Yes, my son!

26:53.000 --> 26:56.390
- Then why don't ya?
- Why don't I try to escape?

26:56.480 --> 27:00.075
Good question. Very good question.
Intelligent.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.199
Because I would be crazy to escape.
I have sent out word.

27:04.280 --> 27:07.511
- I am all taken care of.
- What does that mean?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.478
I've managed to contact
certain underlings, evil spirits...

27:10.560 --> 27:13.120
secretaries of secretaries
and other assorted minions...

27:13.200 --> 27:15.077
who will contact my father.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.993
And when my father finds out
I'm in this kind of place...

27:18.080 --> 27:21.675
he'll have them transfer me
to one of those classy joints...

27:21.760 --> 27:24.593
where they treat you properly,
like a person, a guest!

27:24.680 --> 27:27.035
With sheets and towels
like a big hotel...

27:27.120 --> 27:32.399
with great drugs for all of us
nut-case, lunatic, maniac devils!

27:35.120 --> 27:37.111
Sorry. Sorry.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.112
I got a little agitated.
The thought of escape crossed my mind.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.509
And suddenly--

27:42.600 --> 27:45.717
Suddenly I felt like bending
the fucking bars back!

27:45.800 --> 27:50.590
And ripping out the window frames
and eating them! Yes, eating them!

27:50.680 --> 27:52.875
And leaping, leaping, leaping!

27:52.960 --> 27:55.679
Colonics for everyone!

27:57.440 --> 28:00.159
I'm a mental patient.
I'm supposed to act out.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.232
Wait'll you morons find out who I am!
My father's gonna be really upset.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.880
And when my father gets upset,
the ground shakes.

28:05.960 --> 28:10.909
My father is God!
I worship my father!

28:15.160 --> 28:18.869
<i>These dramatic video tapes, secretly</i>
<i>obtained by animal rights activists...</i>

28:18.960 --> 28:20.996
<i>have aroused public indignation.</i>

28:21.080 --> 28:24.550
<i>But many scientists</i>
<i>vehemently disagree.</i>

28:29.120 --> 28:30.394
Torture experiments.

28:31.800 --> 28:35.349
- We're all monkeys.
- They hurt you?

28:38.160 --> 28:40.879
Not as bad as what they're doing
to the Easter Bunny.

28:43.640 --> 28:47.349
Look at them.
They're just askin' for it.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.357
Maybe the human race
deserves to be wiped out.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.274
Wiping out the human race?

28:56.360 --> 28:59.432
It's a great idea.
It's great.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.511
But more of a long-term thing.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.830
First we have to focus
on more immediate goals.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.275
I didn't say a word
about you-know-what.

29:08.160 --> 29:12.551
- What are you talking about?
- Your plan. Emancipation.

29:15.360 --> 29:18.557
What are you writing?
You a reporter?

29:18.640 --> 29:20.631
It's private.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.911
A lawsuit?
You gonna sue 'em?

29:24.000 --> 29:27.436
Yo,Jimbo.
Time for your meds.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.470
<i>Take a chance.</i>
<i>Live the moment.</i>

29:33.560 --> 29:36.791
<i>Sunshine.</i>
<i>Gorgeous beaches.</i>

29:36.880 --> 29:39.599
<i>The Florida Keys!</i>

29:39.680 --> 29:41.989
<i>We'll return you to the Marx Brothers</i>
<i>in</i> Monkey Business.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.753
Monkey business!

29:46.880 --> 29:48.711
Fetch!

29:52.760 --> 29:55.752
Get it?
Monkey. Monk key.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.792
What?

30:00.560 --> 30:02.915
<i>If you see a bearish future</i>
<i>in the decade ahead...</i>

30:03.000 --> 30:06.515
<i>consider the changes sweeping the world</i>
<i>and the opportunities they offer.</i>

30:06.600 --> 30:09.990
" And the opportunities
they offer.'' Ooh!

30:10.080 --> 30:12.719
They really dosed you.
Jim!

30:12.800 --> 30:15.234
Major load.
Danger, Will Robinson, danger.

30:15.320 --> 30:18.596
You gotta get it together.
Focus, focus, focus.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.592
Remember the plan.
I did my part!

30:21.680 --> 30:22.829
What?

30:24.320 --> 30:26.629
Not " what.'' When.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.631
- When?
- Yes. When.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.994
Now. Now,Jim.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.828
Yes! Now!
Buy! Sell!

30:33.920 --> 30:37.037
Stocks! Bonds!
Purchase! Sell!

30:37.120 --> 30:39.873
Yes!
No more monkey business!

30:39.960 --> 30:42.474
No... more...

30:42.560 --> 30:45.154
monkey business!

30:45.240 --> 30:47.071
Yes, enhance your portfolio now.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.879
Five hundred dollars.
I got $500. I'm insured!

30:49.960 --> 30:53.396
Yeah! A window of opportunity
is opening now.

30:53.480 --> 30:57.109
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the moment. The moment!

30:57.200 --> 30:59.509
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the day!

30:59.600 --> 31:02.512
Goddam it,Jeffrey!
Quit playin' the fool!

31:02.600 --> 31:04.750
MasterCard!
Visa!

31:04.840 --> 31:07.752
The key to happiness!

31:07.840 --> 31:11.276
Jim, seize the moment!

31:11.360 --> 31:13.078
Jeffrey, come back here!

31:22.200 --> 31:23.952
Go,Jim!

31:27.600 --> 31:31.559
- Get out. Out!
- Come here,Jeffrey!

31:42.280 --> 31:46.239
The future can be yours!
Last chance! Last chance!

32:02.720 --> 32:05.837
Best place to go
would be Florida.

32:05.920 --> 32:09.356
The Keys are lovely
this time of year.

32:29.560 --> 32:33.599
Two's not working today.
Use one.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.960
Kathryn,
this was in my box!

33:01.040 --> 33:02.951
But I have a slight suspicion
it wasn't meant for me.

33:03.040 --> 33:06.749
"You are the most <i>bootiful</i>
woman I have ever seen.

33:06.840 --> 33:10.310
You live in a <i>bootiful</i> world,
but you don't know it.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.676
You have freedom, sunshine,
air you can breathe--''

33:13.760 --> 33:16.228
James Cole, right?

33:16.320 --> 33:21.075
"I would do anything to stay here
but I must leave. Please help me.''

33:21.160 --> 33:23.674
Okay, okay, okay.
Poor man.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.672
Hey, Kathryn?
James Cole is one of yours, right?

33:26.760 --> 33:29.320
He eloped.
Last seen, he was up on two.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.913
Shit!

33:36.760 --> 33:39.149
We have to know exactly
what's there so we can fix it.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.515
Doctor, we have a visitor.

33:41.600 --> 33:45.036
May I help you?
Excuse me?

33:54.000 --> 33:57.515
Hey,Jimbo.
What's up, man?

34:03.840 --> 34:07.071
All right, it's okay.
Take it easy.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.628
- It'll be all right.
- Take care.

34:09.719 --> 34:12.996
Take it easy.
We'll work this out, okay?

34:13.080 --> 34:17.197
Send you back to your room. A little
milk and cookies, you'll be all right.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.918
Just take it easy, okay?

34:21.400 --> 34:23.311
Calm down!

34:30.280 --> 34:32.918
Take him down!
Take him the fuck down!

34:38.440 --> 34:41.273
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
Dr Railly, help me, please.

34:41.360 --> 34:44.670
- We'll give you something to calm you.
- No! No more drugs!

34:44.760 --> 34:47.114
James, we have to do this.
You're very confused.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.994
Kathryn, we've been working
together for four years.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.389
I've never seen you
like this before.

35:04.480 --> 35:08.439
So please stop being so defensive.
This isn't an inquisition.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.717
I didn't think I was being defensive.
I was trying to explain exactly what--

35:11.800 --> 35:14.553
He should've been in restraints.

35:14.640 --> 35:18.110
It was bad judgment on your part,
plain and simple. Why not own up to it?

35:18.200 --> 35:20.998
Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have
the strangest feeling about him.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.470
- I've seen him before and I'm trying--
- Two policemen are in the hospital.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.711
Now we've got a security guard
with a skull fracture.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.951
I said it was bad judgment!
What else do you want me to say?

35:31.040 --> 35:33.474
You see that?
See what I mean?

35:33.560 --> 35:36.472
You're being defensive.
Isn't she being defensive?

35:38.000 --> 35:41.276
We have another situation.

35:45.440 --> 35:49.274
- He was fully restrained?
- Yes, sir. I did it myself.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.875
And he was fully sedated?

35:52.960 --> 35:55.030
He was fully sedated.

36:06.880 --> 36:10.714
Are you trying to tell me a fully
sedated, fully restrained patient...

36:10.800 --> 36:14.839
somehow slipped out that vent,
replaced the grill behind him...

36:14.920 --> 36:18.959
and is wriggling his way
through the ventilation system?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.750
Watch it!

36:37.840 --> 36:40.149
You sure fucked up!

36:44.680 --> 36:48.150
- Where are you?
- Ah, you can talk!

36:57.320 --> 36:59.117
My name's not Bob.

36:59.200 --> 37:03.159
Not a prob, Bob.
Where'd they send you?

37:04.560 --> 37:07.074
- Where are you?
- Another cell.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.314
Maybe.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.550
What do you mean " maybe''?
What's that supposed to mean?

37:13.640 --> 37:16.234
Maybe means...

37:16.320 --> 37:19.198
maybe I'm in the next cell.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.795
Another volunteer like you.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.077
Or maybe I'm in
the Central Office...

37:26.160 --> 37:29.436
spying on ya
for all those science bozos.

37:30.560 --> 37:31.879
Or, hey...

37:31.960 --> 37:35.111
maybe I'm not even here.

37:35.200 --> 37:39.239
Maybe I'm just in your head.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.597
No way to confirm anything.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.793
- Where'd they send ya?
- 1990.

37:48.880 --> 37:54.159
'90! How was it?
Good drugs? Lots of pussy?

37:54.240 --> 37:57.789
Hey, Bob, you do the job?

37:57.880 --> 38:01.031
You find out the big info?

38:01.120 --> 38:03.680
Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

38:03.760 --> 38:06.149
It was supposed to be 1996.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.994
Science ain't an exact science
with these clowns.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.640
But they're getting better.

38:12.720 --> 38:16.998
You're lucky you didn't end up
in ancient Egypt.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.513
Shh! They're comin'.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.428
<i>The Freedom for Animals Association</i>
<i>on Second Avenue...</i>

38:23.520 --> 38:26.239
<i>is the secret headquarters</i>
<i>of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.</i>

38:26.320 --> 38:29.835
<i>They are the ones</i>
<i>who are going to do it.</i>

38:29.920 --> 38:32.753
<i>I can't do any more.</i>
<i>I have to go now.</i>

38:32.840 --> 38:35.400
<i>Have a merry Christmas.</i>

38:36.560 --> 38:39.472
- Well?
- What?

38:39.560 --> 38:42.632
Did you or did you not
record that message?

38:42.720 --> 38:46.793
It's a reconstruction
of a deteriorated recording.

38:46.880 --> 38:51.317
Weak signal. We have to put them
together one word at a time.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.311
We just finished
rebuilding this.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.915
Did you or did you not
make this call?

38:57.000 --> 39:02.233
I couldn't make any call. You sent me
to the wrong year. It was 1990.

39:04.880 --> 39:08.111
- You're certain of that?
- What'd you do with your time, Cole?

39:08.200 --> 39:10.873
Did you waste it on drugs?
Women?

39:10.960 --> 39:12.871
- They forced me to take drugs.
- Forced you?

39:12.960 --> 39:16.191
Why would someone
force you to take drugs?

39:17.480 --> 39:22.634
I was in trouble.
I got arrested.

39:25.560 --> 39:29.473
I did what you wanted.
I got a specimen, a spider.

39:29.560 --> 39:33.439
I didn't have anyplace
to put it, so I ate it.

39:33.520 --> 39:37.115
But you sent me to the wrong year,
so it really doesn't matter.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.078
Did you see this
when you went back?

39:40.160 --> 39:42.515
No, sir, I don't think so.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.990
What about these people?
Did you see any of these people?

39:46.080 --> 39:48.992
No.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.833
Oh, wait, wait.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.917
Him?
You saw that man?

39:57.480 --> 39:59.516
Maybe in the mental institution.

39:59.600 --> 40:03.309
You were in a mental institution?
Oh, God.

40:03.400 --> 40:07.359
Cole, you were sent back to make
some very important observations.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.271
You could've made
a real contribution.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.079
Helped us
to reclaim the planet.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.469
As well as reducing
your sentence.

40:14.560 --> 40:18.872
The question is, Cole,
do you want another chance?

40:43.480 --> 40:46.950
Last connection going on.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.717
No mistakes this time, Cole.

41:31.800 --> 41:34.633
Stay alert.
Keep your eyes open.

41:34.720 --> 41:38.315
We're thinking about the spider, Cole.
Try and do something like that again.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.356
Just relax now.
Don't fight it.

41:40.440 --> 41:43.398
We're sending you
to the third quarter of 1996.

41:43.480 --> 41:45.789
Right on the money.

42:21.280 --> 42:22.759
I don't understand!

42:24.680 --> 42:26.716
What?

42:26.800 --> 42:28.552
I don't understand!

42:29.800 --> 42:32.917
- Where am I?
- I gotta find 'em! I gotta find 'em!

42:33.000 --> 42:35.275
Help me!
I don't know where I am.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.197
- You gotta help me find 'em!
-Jose?

42:39.280 --> 42:41.157
-Jose!
- Cole!

42:41.240 --> 42:43.834
Cole, where are we?

42:45.960 --> 42:47.951
- Help me, Cole!
- Oh, God, wait!

43:01.600 --> 43:03.750
<i>"In a season of great pestilence...</i>

43:03.840 --> 43:07.276
<i>there are omens and divinations.</i>

43:07.360 --> 43:09.396
And one of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

43:09.480 --> 43:12.472
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God...

43:12.560 --> 43:15.518
who liveth forever and ever.''

43:15.600 --> 43:17.033
Revelations.

43:17.120 --> 43:20.635
In the 14th century, according to
accounts of officials of that time...

43:20.720 --> 43:24.030
this man appeared suddenly in
the village of Wyle near Stonehenge...

43:24.120 --> 43:25.997
in April of 1362.

43:26.880 --> 43:29.474
Using unfamiliar words
and speaking in a strange accent...

43:29.560 --> 43:32.313
the man made dire prognostications
about a pestilence...

43:32.400 --> 43:36.791
which he said would wipe out humanity
in approximately 600 years.

43:36.880 --> 43:40.998
Obviously this plague-doomsday scenario
is considerably more compelling...

43:41.080 --> 43:42.991
when reality supports it
with a virulent disease...

43:43.080 --> 43:46.117
whether it's the bubonic plague,
small pox or AIDS.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.270
Now we have technological horrors
as well...

43:48.360 --> 43:50.954
such as chemical warfare,
which first reared its ugly head...

43:51.040 --> 43:53.713
during the deadly mustard gas attacks
of World War I.

43:53.800 --> 43:57.110
During such an attack in the French
trenches in October of 1917...

43:57.200 --> 43:58.872
we have an account
of this soldier...

43:58.960 --> 44:01.428
who, during an assault,
was wounded by shrapnel...

44:01.520 --> 44:04.478
and hospitalized, apparently
in a state of hysteria.

44:04.560 --> 44:07.518
Doctors found he had lost
all comprehension of French...

44:07.600 --> 44:09.830
but that he spoke English fluently...

44:09.920 --> 44:12.957
albeit in a regional dialect
they didn't recognize.

44:13.040 --> 44:16.396
The man, though physically
unaffected by the gas...

44:16.480 --> 44:18.710
was beside himself.

44:18.800 --> 44:21.519
He claimed that he
had come from the future...

44:21.600 --> 44:23.556
that he was looking
for a pure germ...

44:23.640 --> 44:26.473
that would ultimately wipe mankind
off the face of the Earth...

44:26.560 --> 44:29.393
starting in the year 1996.

44:31.120 --> 44:35.193
Though injured, the young soldier
disappeared from the hospital...

44:35.280 --> 44:37.840
no doubt trying to carry on
his mission to warn others...

44:37.920 --> 44:40.275
and substituting
for the agony of war...

44:40.360 --> 44:43.636
a self-inflicted agony
we call "the Cassandra complex."

44:43.720 --> 44:47.190
Cassandra, in Greek legend,
was condemned to know the future...

44:47.280 --> 44:50.078
but to be disbelieved
when she foretold it.

44:50.160 --> 44:54.119
Hence, the agony of foreknowledge, plus
the impotence to do anything about it.

45:06.760 --> 45:10.355
I'm going right out
to get vaccinated.

45:10.440 --> 45:13.512
I think, Dr Railly,
you've given alarmists a bad name.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.318
I have?

45:15.400 --> 45:20.190
There's real data that the planet cannot
survive the excesses of the human race.

45:20.280 --> 45:22.919
- This is true.
- Proliferation of atomic devices.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.116
Uncontrolled breeding habits.

45:25.200 --> 45:28.590
Pollution of land, sea and air.
The rape of the environment.

45:28.680 --> 45:33.310
In this context, it's obvious Chicken
Little represents the sane vision...

45:33.400 --> 45:36.995
and that <i>Homo sapiens'</i> motto,
"Let's go shopping" ...

45:37.080 --> 45:39.913
is the cry of the true lunatic.

45:43.200 --> 45:47.398
Please, Dr Railly. I wonder
if you're aware of my own studies.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.592
See you at work tomorrow.

45:56.680 --> 45:59.319
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

46:15.280 --> 46:16.872
Get in the car!

46:16.960 --> 46:19.793
I've got a gun. Get in the car.

46:24.720 --> 46:26.119
Drive.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.475
Take my purse.
I've got a lot of cash, credit cards.

46:28.560 --> 46:31.120
- Take my keys.
- Start the car!

46:43.880 --> 46:46.314
Here, turn right.
Turn right here.

46:51.480 --> 46:54.313
- Where are we going?
- Philadelphia.

46:54.400 --> 46:58.075
- That's more than a hundred miles.
- That's why I can't walk there.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.628
-Just let me go.
-Just drive!

47:00.720 --> 47:03.029
- You can take the car.
- I don't know how to drive.

47:04.600 --> 47:08.229
I went underground when I was eight.
I told you that before.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.719
At the next--

47:09.800 --> 47:14.430
- At the next corner, turn right.
- Cole.James Cole.

47:14.520 --> 47:18.069
You escaped from a locked room
six years ago.

47:18.160 --> 47:20.993
Six years for you.
Come on.

47:21.080 --> 47:22.718
Turn around! Get goin'.

47:33.040 --> 47:36.635
I can't believe that this
is a coincidence, Mr Cole.

47:36.720 --> 47:39.678
- Have you been following me?
- You said you would help me.

47:39.760 --> 47:42.911
I know this isn't what you meant,
but...

47:43.000 --> 47:44.991
I don't have any money.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.709
I hurt my leg.
I've been sleeping on the street.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.358
I'm sure I smell bad.

47:51.360 --> 47:54.318
Do you have any food in this car?

47:54.400 --> 47:57.995
- You have been following me?
- No.

47:58.080 --> 48:00.719
No, I saw this...

48:02.080 --> 48:04.833
in a store window.

48:04.920 --> 48:07.718
I can read, remember?

48:10.400 --> 48:12.356
Why do you want to go
to Philadelphia?

48:12.440 --> 48:16.558
I checked out the Baltimore information.
It was nothing.

48:17.800 --> 48:21.315
It's in Philadelphia.
That's where the ones who did it are.

48:21.400 --> 48:24.233
The Twelve Monkeys.

48:25.320 --> 48:28.790
Is that a radio?
Can you turn it on?

48:31.880 --> 48:35.031
<i>This is a personal message to you.</i>

48:35.120 --> 48:37.190
<i>Are you at the end of your rope?</i>

48:37.280 --> 48:39.794
<i>Are you dying to get away?</i>

48:39.880 --> 48:43.395
<i>The Florida Keys are waiting for you.</i>
<i>Ocean waves--</i>

48:43.480 --> 48:45.596
I've never seen the ocean.

48:45.680 --> 48:49.195
It's an advertisement, Mr Cole.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.919
What?

48:52.000 --> 48:54.673
It's an advertisement.
You understand that, don't you?

48:54.760 --> 48:58.514
It's not really
a special message to you.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.438
Mr Cole.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.673
- You used to call me James.
- You prefer that?

49:08.480 --> 49:11.631
James, you don't really
have a gun--

49:11.720 --> 49:14.757
Can you turn this up?
Can you make this louder?

49:15.840 --> 49:18.912
<i>I found my thrill</i>

49:20.560 --> 49:23.711
<i>On Blueberry Hill</i>

49:30.600 --> 49:33.160
<i>When I found you</i>

49:35.600 --> 49:38.398
I love the music
of the 20th century.

49:40.400 --> 49:44.109
I love this air.
Love to breathe this air!

49:56.680 --> 49:59.194
<i>WXBX news break.</i>

49:59.280 --> 50:01.396
<i>News as it happens.</i>
<i>Roger Pratt reporting.</i>

50:01.480 --> 50:04.870
<i>A story breaking now is emergency crews</i>
<i>are converging on a corn field...</i>

50:04.960 --> 50:07.030
<i>where playmates of nine-year-old</i>
<i>Ricky Neuman say...</i>

50:07.120 --> 50:09.111
<i>he disappeared before their eyes.</i>

50:09.200 --> 50:11.953
<i>Young Neuman apparently stepped</i>
<i>into an abandoned well shaft...</i>

50:12.040 --> 50:14.508
<i>and is lodged somewhere</i>
<i>in the narrow 150-foot pipe.</i>

50:14.600 --> 50:19.037
<i>Possibly alive, possibly badly injured,</i>
<i>playmates heard him cry out faintly.</i>

50:19.120 --> 50:22.317
- Never cry wolf.
- What?

50:22.400 --> 50:25.517
My father said that to me.
He said, "Never cry wolf."

50:25.600 --> 50:29.309
Then people won't believe you
if something really happens.

50:29.400 --> 50:33.154
If something really happens
like what,James?

50:33.240 --> 50:35.151
Something bad.

50:35.240 --> 50:37.390
Can we have some more music, please?
I don't wanna hear this stuff.

50:37.480 --> 50:40.233
Can we hear more music?

50:41.560 --> 50:45.917

51:14.360 --> 51:16.396
<i>Well, he's back, and he's--</i>

<i>Sorry about that. He's looking for you.</i>
<i>I thought you oughta know.</i>

51:19.800 --> 51:21.313
<i>Take care.</i>

51:21.400 --> 51:24.790
It's just like I told you.
Me and my husband went ahead.

51:24.880 --> 51:28.793
I don't know. She never showed.
That is totally unlike her.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.792
Do you happen to know
the make of her car?

51:31.880 --> 51:34.030
Cherokee. '94 Cherokee.

51:34.280 --> 51:36.350
<i>Silver.</i>

51:40.040 --> 51:41.598

51:58.440 --> 52:01.000
<i>Excuse me, mister.</i>
<i>Have a cigar.</i>

52:21.600 --> 52:24.160
<i>Yoo-hoo, woodpecker!</i>

52:48.800 --> 52:51.633
You were in my dream just now.

52:53.280 --> 52:56.397
Hair is different.
Different colour.

52:58.480 --> 53:00.789
I'm sure it was you.

53:02.560 --> 53:05.120
What was the dream about?

53:07.080 --> 53:09.719
About an airport...

53:09.800 --> 53:12.155
before everything happened.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.600
It's the same dream
I always have.

53:15.680 --> 53:18.513
When I was a kid.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.511
And I was in it?

53:20.600 --> 53:22.909
What did I do?

53:24.200 --> 53:25.394
You were very upset.

53:27.960 --> 53:30.713
You're always very upset
in the dream.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.711
Just never knew it was you.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.836
It wasn't me before,James.

53:34.920 --> 53:38.515
It's become me now
because of what's happening.

53:40.480 --> 53:42.914
Could you please untie me?

53:46.600 --> 53:49.797
No, I think it was always you.

53:49.880 --> 53:52.474
Very strange.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.710
You're flushed
and you were moaning.

53:54.800 --> 53:58.190
I think you're running a fever.

54:06.280 --> 54:08.430
What are you doing?

54:19.480 --> 54:23.917
<i>In Fresno, California, crews continue</i>
<i>to attempt to rescue Ricky Neuman.</i>

54:29.400 --> 54:32.073
<i>Closer to home, in Baltimore,</i>
<i>Kathryn Railly...</i>

54:32.160 --> 54:35.630
<i>prominent psychiatrist and author of</i>
<i>a newly released book on insanity...</i>

54:35.720 --> 54:39.713
<i>disappeared mysteriously last night</i>
<i>after a lecture at the university.</i>

54:39.800 --> 54:42.997
<i>Former mental patient James Cole</i>
<i>is wanted for questioning...</i>

54:43.080 --> 54:45.389
<i>regarding Dr Railly's disappearance.</i>

54:45.480 --> 54:47.710
<i>Authorities warn that Cole</i>
<i>has a history of violence...</i>

54:47.800 --> 54:51.236
<i>and advise anyone spotting him</i>
<i>to notify authorities at once.</i>

55:00.680 --> 55:03.114
I love this music.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.714
We don't have this.
We don't have anything like this.

55:05.800 --> 55:08.109
What are all those?

55:08.200 --> 55:09.474
These?

55:09.560 --> 55:12.313
My notes, clues.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.311
What kind of clues?

55:14.400 --> 55:16.311
It's about the secret army.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.516
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They're the ones that spread the virus.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.512
That's why I'm here.
I have to find them. That's my mission.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.512
Have to locate them because they
have the virus in its pure form...

55:24.600 --> 55:26.192
before it mutates.

55:26.280 --> 55:29.033
When I locate them,
they'll send a scientist back here.

55:29.120 --> 55:31.076
That scientist will study the virus.

55:31.160 --> 55:35.039
When he goes back to the present,
he and the scientists will make a cure.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.270
<i>Police officers</i>
<i>from threejurisdictions...</i>

55:37.360 --> 55:40.477
<i>apparently including</i>
<i>special tactical unit personnel...</i>

55:40.560 --> 55:44.553
<i>have now been mobilized to control</i>
<i>the growing thousands of onlookers...</i>

55:44.640 --> 55:46.790
<i>here in Fresno, California.</i>

55:46.880 --> 55:48.472
Does that disturb you?

55:48.560 --> 55:52.109
No. Thought it was about us.

55:52.200 --> 55:55.954
Thought maybe they'd captured us
and arrested me.

55:57.040 --> 55:58.234
Just a joke.

56:03.040 --> 56:06.316
I remember being very afraid
for that little boy.

56:06.400 --> 56:08.197
All alone, down that well...

56:08.280 --> 56:10.316
not knowing if anybody's
gonna get him out.

56:11.800 --> 56:13.836
First time I was really afraid
when I was a kid.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.831
What do you mean,
"when you were a kid" ?

56:15.920 --> 56:18.559
Never mind.
Just a prank, a hoax.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.631
That boy's hiding in a barn.

56:32.640 --> 56:35.438
"There are omens and divinations.

56:35.520 --> 56:38.910
One of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

56:39.000 --> 56:42.595
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God...

56:42.680 --> 56:46.150
who liveth forever and ever.''

56:46.240 --> 56:49.312
You won't think I'm crazy
when people start dying next month.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.798
First they'll think
it's just some weird fever.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.195
Then they'll find out.

56:59.280 --> 57:02.033
They'll catch on.

57:03.280 --> 57:06.113
Wait. Stop here! Stop the car!
Stop right here!

57:10.120 --> 57:13.192
I was right. They're here!

57:13.280 --> 57:16.716
You see? Twelve Monkeys!
Twelve Monkeys!

57:16.800 --> 57:19.917
You believe me now?
Come on!

57:22.560 --> 57:24.630
Come on!

57:24.720 --> 57:26.915
They're here, you see?

57:27.000 --> 57:29.309
Twelve Monkeys!

57:29.400 --> 57:31.356
Twelve Monkeys. Come on!

57:33.400 --> 57:35.197
Twelve Monkeys.

57:35.280 --> 57:37.714
Wait, wait. Wait, here.

57:37.800 --> 57:40.109
Here, do you see it?
Do you see?

57:40.200 --> 57:42.589
I see some red paint,
some marks.

57:42.680 --> 57:45.399
- Marks? You think that--
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

57:47.160 --> 57:50.709
Don't--
Don't you do anything crazy.

57:50.800 --> 57:52.518
Or I'll hurt somebody.

57:52.600 --> 57:55.717
I am not gonna do anything crazy, but
none of this is what you think it is!

57:55.800 --> 57:58.234
You can't hide from them, Bob.

57:59.320 --> 58:02.790
I said, you can't hide from them.

58:04.360 --> 58:06.510
No, sir, ol' Bob.

58:06.600 --> 58:09.319
Don't even try.

58:12.120 --> 58:14.793
They hear everything.

58:14.880 --> 58:18.111
They got that tracking device on ya.

58:20.720 --> 58:23.871
They can find you anywhere,
anytime!

58:23.960 --> 58:26.394
It's in the tooth.

58:26.480 --> 58:28.914
Right, Bob?

58:29.000 --> 58:31.514
But I fooled 'em, old buddy.

58:36.600 --> 58:40.195
They don't have to spy on me.
I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

58:40.280 --> 58:43.078
You see? Here it is again. See?

58:43.160 --> 58:46.118
Here, follow this paint trail.

58:46.200 --> 58:48.316
Here. It's here, see?

58:48.720 --> 58:50.312
I am not going--

58:51.600 --> 58:55.718
Come with me!
The paint trail goes here.

58:57.760 --> 59:01.150
Let go of my arm!
James, we shouldn't be here.

59:01.240 --> 59:03.151
Goddam it!

59:11.480 --> 59:12.708
Leave me alone!

59:14.880 --> 59:18.429
Let's get out of here.
James, we shouldn't be here.

59:31.720 --> 59:34.359
Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me, please!

59:34.440 --> 59:37.352
Don't kill me, don't kill me!

59:42.400 --> 59:43.992
Stick around, bitch.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.994
Are you all right?

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.557
Is he alive?

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.518
Go ahead.
We're runnin' out of time.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.511
- You can't help him.
- Oh,Jesus!

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.113
James, you killed him!

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.919
All I see are dead people.
Come on.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.798
- Come on.
- You never had a gun before!

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.633
I have one now.
Come on. Come on!

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.388
"Dragons in their pleasant palaces.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.393
The seventh angel poured out
his vial into the air...

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.199
and there came--''
You!

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.875
You're one of us.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.759
This is it.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.558
Come on.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.679
Can we help you?

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.109
It's just a tape.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.791
I'm looking for
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.353
We don't know anything about an Army
of the Twelve Monkeys so just disappear.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.237
-Just want some information.
- Didn't you hear me?

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.153
Don't hurt her!

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.915
Please, I'm a psychiatrist.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.879
Just do whatever he tells you to do.
He's disturbed. He's dangerous.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.315
- Please just cooperate.
- You want money?

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.550
- We only got a few bucks.
- I told you what I want.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.950
Get down. Lock that door.
Lock it now!

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.031
- I told you that Goines would get us--
- Shut up!

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.517
- Goines?
-Jeffrey Goines?

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.910
Jeffrey becomes this big star,
and the media latch onto him...

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.991
because he's picketing
his own father...

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.071
a famous
Nobel-prize-winning virologist.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.390
You must have seen all that on TV.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.119
I don't watch TV.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.474
Is this him?

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.949
Yeah, that's him, that's him.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.191
What are you gonna do to us?

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.193
Tell me more about Jeffrey.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.314
Jeffrey started getting bored
with the shit we do--

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.914
picketing, leafleting,
letter-writing stuff.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.719
He said we were ineffectual,
liberal jerk-offs.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.476
He wanted to do guerrilla actions
in order to educate the public.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.552
- Like this?
- He let 100 snakes loose in the Senate.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.190
But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
It's counterproductive. We told him.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.477
So he and 11 guys,
they split off...

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.630
and formed this underground army.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.231
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
See?

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.715
They started planning
a"human hunt."

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.995
They bought stun guns,
nets and bear traps.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.389
They were gonna go to Wall Street
and trap lawyers and bankers.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.914
They didn't do it, of course.
They didn't do any of it.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.515
Like always, Mr Big Shot
sold his friends out.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.795
What does that mean?

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.678
He goes on TV and gives this big
news conference, tells the world...

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.638
he just realized his dad's experiments
are vital for humanity...

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.473
and that the use of animals
is absolutely necessary...

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.315
that from now on, he,Jeffrey Goines,
will personally supervise the labs...

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.153
to make sure all the little animals
aren't going to suffer.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.872
What is this?

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.036
People like that aren't accessible.
You can't just barge in on them.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.839
- It's not how the world works.
- Be quiet and drive the car.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.831
- I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.435
This car is stolen,
and we are in big trouble.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.431
Big trouble.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.876
If you don't turn yourself over to
the police, they're going to kill you.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.190
They're going to shoot me, too,
because I'm an accessory to murder.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.319
- You're all going to die.
- Nobody is going to die.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.515
You're not going to save the world,
okay? You're delusional.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.512
You've made all this up
out of bits and pieces in your head.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.795
- No.
- Yes!

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.791
Let me give you an example.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.190
You know Jeffrey Goines. You were
both patients at County Hospital.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.398
Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.473
He told you that his father was a famous
scientist who worked with viruses...

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.393
so you incorporated that information
to this cockeyed fantasy.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.914
He didn't say his father was
a scientist. He said his father was God.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.513
This is insane.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.717
<i>Prominent psychiatrist and author</i>
<i>Dr Kathryn Railly has been abducted...</i>

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.792

<i>James Cole.</i>

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.677
<i>Cole was under Railly's care</i>
<i>six years ago...</i>

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.832

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.552
- What is the matter with your leg?
- I got shot.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:14.914
Shot?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.353
Who shot you?

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.154
I don't know.
It was some kind of war. Never mind.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.515
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.272
What are you doing?

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.278
-We don't need gas.
-I thought you didn't know how to drive.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.113
I said I was too young to drive.
I didn't say I was stupid.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.677
This can't go on.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.638
If you have a bullet in your leg,
I have to take care of it.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.632
I'm a doctor.
I need some supplies.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.717

<i>authorities say there is still a chance</i>

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:18.719
You shouldn't put your weight on it.
You need stitches and antibiotics.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.112
Lucky for you,
it's near the surface.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.314
I love seeing the sun.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.914
Wait.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.514
Let me help you.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.069
You smell so good.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.719
You have to give yourself up.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.799
You know that?

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.115
What are you doing? James?

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.839
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.680
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.830
Let go of me!

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.351
- They find him?
- Who?

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.874
- That kid, the one in the pipe.
- You believe that?

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.951
They're lowering a monkey
down there...

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.110
with an infrared camera
strapped on him...

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.919
and a roast beef sandwich
wrapped up in tin foil.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.991
- You're makin' it up.
- I shit you not, man.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.993
- Life is really weird.
- A monkey and a roast beef sandwich.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.272
Would that I could enjoy
this opulent dinner...

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:52.512
and this most stimulating
and exciting company...

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.559
for itself,
with no sense of purpose.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.110
But, alas, I am burdened.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.275
For with all this excess of public
attention and cacophony of praise...

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.399
there comes great responsibility.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.519
I don't have to tell you all
that the dangers of science...

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.113
are a timeworn threat.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.634
From Prometheus stealing fire
from the gods--

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.314
What friend?
I'm not expecting anyone.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:25.038
But never before--

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.189
This is ridiculous.

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:30.590
My father's giving
a major address.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.830
...to fear the power...

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.076
we have at hand.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.550
Normally, if we caught a guy...

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.631
sneaking around with no ID,
we'd bust his ass.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.995
Excuse my French.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.991
This one says he knows you.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.310
Since you seem to have had
a few unusual associates...

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:52.471
we certainly would not want
to arrest one of your closest pals.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.951
Never seen him before
in my life.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.600
Feel free to torture this man,
or whatever it is you do.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.877
I'm going back to listen to my father's
eloquent discourse on the perils of--

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.032
I'm here about some monkeys.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.872
- Monkeys?
- Monkeys, yes.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.758
Twelve of them.

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.432
Arnold.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.670
- You look like shit.
- You know this man?

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.639
Of course I know this man.
Arnold Pettibone.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.792
Gee, Arnie, it's black tie.
I said, "Drop by."

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.634
But it's Dad's big do--
VIPs, senators, secret service.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.518
You hungry, Arnie?

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.591
Real killer feast we're putting on.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.148
Lots of dead lamb, dead cow,
dead pig.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.037
Shall we?

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.315
Hi. How are you? Hello.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.631
Very attractive.
"The Great Escape," 1990.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.632
Watch it! Huh?
County Hospital? Am I right?

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.314
I can't do anything
about what you're going to do.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.312
I can't change anything.
I won't stop you. I can't stop you.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.039
- I just want the information.
- Come on.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.510
Hi, ladies. So nice to see you again.
Watch your step on the way down.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.478
All right. Who blabbed?
Bruhns? Weller?

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.471
I just want access
to the pure virus.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.757
- Virus?
- I need to know where and what it is.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.515
I get it. I see what you're up to.
It's your old plan, isn't it?

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.511
- What plan?
- Your plan.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.909
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yes, you do.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.991
We were in the day room
watching television...

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.719
and you were upset about the desecration
of the planet, which I understand.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.712
Then you said, "Wouldn't it be great
to have a germ or virus...

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.473
that would wipe out mankind
and leave the animals and trees?''

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.710
- You're trying to confuse me.
- You were so funny.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.916
I told you my father
was this famous virologist.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.118
You said, "He could make a germ,
and we could steal it."

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.998
- You were so funny.
- They mutate! We live underground!

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.469
The world belongs
to the dogs and cats.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.553
We live like worms.
I just need the information!

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.076
-Take it easy.
-You are a nutcase, completely deranged!

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.517
Delusional, paranoid.
Your process is all fucked up.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.239
Your information tray
is jammed, man.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.515
Do you know what it is,
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.319
It's a collection of space-case
do-gooders saving rain forests.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.516
I have nothing to do
with those bozos any more.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.798
I've quit being the rich-kid fall guy
for a bunch of ineffective fanatics!

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.474
So much for your grand plot,
asshole!

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.710
My father has warned people
about the dangers...

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.916
of experimenting with DNA viruses
for years.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.436
You processed that information through
your addled, paranoid infrastructure.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.954
Lo and behold,
a non-profit organization...

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.759
becomes a sinister,
revolutionary cabal!

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.876
This man is complete bat shit!

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.518
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.717
do you realize where he thinks
he comes from?

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.918
<i>Captain Dan Miller, the man</i>
<i>in charge of the rescue operation...</i>

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.036
<i>says he has consulted with experts...</i>

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.190
<i>and they assure us</i>
<i>there will be no negative--</i>

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.795
If you ask me, the monkey's gonna eat
that goddam sandwich himself.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.519
Did a man just come
running through here?

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.513
<i>His primary responsibility</i>
<i>was to the missing boy.</i>

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.670
<i>Police say</i>
<i>that the body of a woman...</i>

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.910
<i>found strangled</i>
<i>in Knutson State Park...</i>

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.911
<i>could be kidnapping victim...</i>

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.911
<i>Dr Kathryn Railly.</i>

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.353
Anybody see someone
come through here?

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.512
<i>The body was discovered</i>
<i>less than an hour ago by hikers.</i>

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.319
<i>But we have an unconfirmed report</i>
<i>that the victim...</i>

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.516
<i>a woman in her late 20s</i>
<i>or early 30s...</i>

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.477
<i>was savagely mutilated.</i>

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.597
<i>Earlier in the day, police located</i>
<i>Railly's abandoned car.</i>

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.240
<i>It was found not far from--</i>

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.308
Any sign of him?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.799
Nothing.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.789
He can't just disappear.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.436
You bastard!

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.713
I could have died in there,
you son of a bitch!

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.030
What are you thinking of...

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.918
you twisted sack of shit?

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.717
Sorry I locked you in the trunk.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.109
I'm sick of you.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.997
What have you done?
Did you kill somebody?

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.593
Yes.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.911
- A million people, five billion people.
- What?

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.915
Jeffrey Goines said that it
was my idea about the virus.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.028
We were in the institution.
It was all so fuzzy with the drugs.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.111
Do you think it was my idea?

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.873
Do you think maybe
I wiped out the human race?

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.872
Nobody is gonna wipe out
the human race.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.872
Not you or Jeffrey
or anybody else.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.111
You've created something
in your mind.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.873
- Mentally divergent?
- Whatever.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.316
A substitute reality...

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.915
because you don't want
to deal with anything.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.390
I would love it
if that was true.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:16.119
It can be dealt with,
but only if you want to.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.509
I can help you.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.716
- They're after me.
- Who is after you?

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.713
We have to get out of here.
There were policemen at that party.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.719
Party? You went to a--

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.518
Never mind.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.512
It's important you surrender instead
of them catching you running away.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.512
Wouldn't it be great if I was crazy?
Then the world would be okay.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.511
- Give me the gun. Where is the gun?
- I lost the gun.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.716
I could live right here.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.110
You got water, air, stars.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.316
- I'm gonna attract their attention.
- Debris.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.312
I'm gonna attract their attention
so they know where we are.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.438
I love this world!

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.829
They're gonna tell you to put your hands
on your head. Do what they say.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.876
I love the frogs, the spiders.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.473
I'll be with you.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.518
I'll help you. I won't let them--

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.832
Then I said something about cooperating,
and he said he would do that.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.230
So I got in the car.

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.312
Thanks. And when l--

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.518
I started honking the horn,
and when I got out, he was gone.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.795
I tell you something.
You lucked out.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.678
For a while we thought you were a body
found down state, mutilated.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.116
- He wouldn't do that.
- This the man he attacked?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.275
I want to be clear
about this, okay?

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.635
This man and the other one
were severely beating us.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.508
James Cole didn't start it.
In fact, he saved me.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.919
Funny thing, Doctor.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.278
Maybe you can help explain it to me,
you being a psychiatrist and all.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:01.309
Why do kidnap victims always tell us
about the guys that grabbed 'em...

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.312
and they try
to make us understand...

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.312
how kind these bastards really were.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.517
It's a normal reaction
to a life-threatening situation.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.709
He's sick, okay?

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:19.314
He thinks he comes
from the future.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.278
He lives in a meticulously constructed
fantasy world that's disintegrating.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.669
He needs help.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.516
<i>Exhausted but apparently unharmed</i>
<i>by her 30-hour ordeal...</i>

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.639
<i>Dr Railly returned to Baltimore</i>
<i>without making a public statement.</i>

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.315
<i>The author and psychiatrist</i>
<i>is currently in seclusion at her home.</i>

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.995
<i>Meantime, police have pieced together</i>
<i>a scenario of the series of events...</i>

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.311
<i>that began with escaped</i>
<i>mental patient James Cole--</i>

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.311
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.790
I'm just hyper-alert.
I can't sleep.

01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:00.317
- Did you take a sedative?
- I hate those things. They mess me up.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.594
<i>With the kidnapping</i>
<i>of the Baltimore woman, James Cole...</i>

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.591
<i>is now also wanted in connection...</i>

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.036
<i>with the brutal slaying of Rodney</i>
<i>Wiggins, an ex-convict from Ardmore.</i>

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.998
<i>His body was discovered</i>
<i>in an abandoned theatre...</i>

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.390
<i>not far from where Cole left 3 animal</i>
<i>rights activists bound and gagged...</i>

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.914
<i>in their Second Avenue headquarters.</i>

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.993
Now, do they really believe that he's
going to show up here? Please.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.038
<i>In Fresno, California, the corn field</i>
<i>that was jammed with spectators--</i>

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.190
He's dead, isn't he?
That little boy.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.636
He's fine. It was just a prank
he and his friends pulled.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.871
<i>The dramatic attempts to rescue Ricky</i>
<i>Neuman from an abandoned mine shaft...</i>

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.235
<i>ended abruptly</i>
<i>when playmates confessed...</i>

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.311
<i>that Neuman's disappearance</i>
<i>was a prank.</i>

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:44.359
<i>In fact, the missing child</i>
<i>was hiding in a nearby barn.</i>

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.988
<i>I found my thrill</i>

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.629
<i>On Blueberry Hill</i>

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.631
<i>On Blueberry Hill</i>

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.516
<i>When I found you</i>

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.955
Congratulations, Cole.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.235
Well done. Well done.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.993
During your interview,
while you were under the influence...

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.399
you told us you liked music.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.516
- This isn't a prison,James.
- This is a hospital.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.512
- Until you recover your equilibrium.
- You're still a little disoriented.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.593
- Time travel is a very stressful thing.
- You stood up very well, considering.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.592
You connected the Twelve Monkeys
with a famous virologist and his son.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.114
- Others will take over now.
- We'll be back in service in months.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.269
We'll retake the planet.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.794
This is what you've been working for.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.314
- A full pardon.
- You'll be out of here in no time.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:38.312
- Women will want to get to know you.
- I don't want your women!

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.789
I want to get well!

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.029
And you will be well,James.

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.838
Soon.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.199
You know, you people don't exist.
You're not real.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.589
We can't travel back in time.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.229
You're not here.
You can't trick me.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.509
You're in my mind.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:14.714
I am insane,
and you are my insanity.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.436
He not only
used the word " prank" ...

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.511
he said the boy
was hiding in a barn.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.195
Kathryn, Kathryn,
he kidnapped you.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.748
You saw him murder somebody...

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.876
and you knew there was
a real possibility...

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:39.315
he could kill you too.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.755
You're under tremendous
emotional stress.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.149
For God's sake, Owen,
listen to me.

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.037
He knew about the boy in Fresno...

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.190
and he says five billion people
are gonna die.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.748
No way he could possibly know that.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.472
You're a rational person.
You're a trained psychiatrist.

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.472
You know the difference
between what's real and what's not.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.438
What we say is the truth
is what everybody accepts, right?

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.829
Psychiatry is the latest religion.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.469
We decide what's right and wrong.
We decide who's crazy or not.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.836
I'm in trouble here.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:15.639
I'm losing my faith.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.913
<i>You sure fucked up, Bob.</i>

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.911
<i>But I can understand.</i>

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.878
<i>You don't want your mistakes</i>
<i>pointed out to you.</i>

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.520
<i>I can relate to that, old Bob.</i>

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.391
<i>I know what you're thinkin'.</i>

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:34.598
<i>You're thinkin'I don't exist</i>
<i>except in your head.</i>

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.591
<i>I can see that point of view.</i>

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:40.389
<i>But you could still talk to me,</i>
<i>couldn't ya?</i>

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.277
I saw you...

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.796
in 1996, in the real world.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:49.714
- You pulled out your teeth.
<i>- Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?</i>

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.791
<i>That's a no-no.</i>

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.872
<i>And when did you say you saw me?</i>

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.633
<i>- In 1872?</i>
- Leave me alone!

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:01.156
<i>Yellin' won't get you</i>
<i>what you want.</i>

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.869
<i>You have to be smart</i>
<i>to get what you want.</i>

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.113
- What do I want?
<i>- You don't know what you want?</i>

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.033
<i>Sure you do, Bob.</i>

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.270
<i>You know what you want.</i>

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.318
You tell me.
Tell me what I want.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:23.712
<i>To see the sky and the ocean...</i>

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.314
<i>to be topside...</i>

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.789
<i>breathe the air...</i>

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.111
<i>to be with her.</i>

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.509
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.637
<i>Isn't that what you want?</i>

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:39.472
<i>Bob?</i>

01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:00.197
Jim Halperin, Philly PD.
Sorry to call you so early.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.670
You found him? Is he okay?

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.955
No, no.
Au contraire, Doctor.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.951
No sign of your good friend,
the kidnapper.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.235
However, the plot does thicken.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.515
I got a ballistics report here
on my desk.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.034
It says the bullet you claim
you removed from Cole's thigh...

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.997
is, in fact, an antique.

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.877
<i>And all indications are...</i>

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.509
<i>it was fired sometime</i>
<i>prior to the 1920s.</i>

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.716
- <i>How about I take a spin down there?</i>
- This can't be.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.711
<i>You and I can grab a bite to eat...</i>

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.030
and maybe you could revise
or amplify your statement.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:07.432
<i>You can't trick us, you know.</i>
<i>It wouldn't work.</i>

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.794
No, sir.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:12.917
<i>You haven't become addicted,</i>
<i>have you...</i>

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.752
<i>to that dying world?</i>

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:17.115
No, sir.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.475
I just want to do my part
to get us back on top...

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.551
in charge of the planet.

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:25.110
And I have the experience.
I know the people involved.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.111
He really is the most qualified.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.156
But all that behaviour.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.754
You said we weren't real.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.432
I don't think the human mind
is meant to exist...

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.351
in two different...

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.796
whatever you called it,
dimensions?

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:44.917
It's just too stressful.
You said that yourself.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.514
It's very confusing. You don't know
what's real and what's not.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.592
<i>But you know what's real now.</i>

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.352
Yes, sir, I do.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.950
No, I don't know anything about...

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.508
a monkey army, Doctor.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:02.239
No, nothing whatsoever.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:06.472
Good Lord, if my son was ever
involved in something like that--

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:10.394
Yeah? Well, I'm sorry.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:14.473
I think it's doubly inappropriate
to discuss...

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:18.633
security matters with you,
Dr Railly.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.030
But if it will ease your mind...

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.475
rest assured that neither my son...

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.755
nor any other unauthorized person...

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:31.675
has access to potentially
dangerous organisms in my laboratory.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.799
Is that clear to you now?
Thank you so much for your concern.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.914
Women psychiatrists!

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.432
I attended a lecture
of hers once.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.990
" Apocalyptic Visions."

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.072
She was suddenly struck...

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.994
by the most preposterous notion
about Jeffrey.

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:03.712
Has she succumbed to her own...

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.634
"theoretical" Cassandra disease?

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.998
Maybe we ought to review
our security procedures.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.473
Perhaps upgrade 'em,
you know?

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.471
Beef'em up.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.629
Let's consider again
our current information.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.712
If the symptoms were
first detected in Philadelphia...

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.349
on December 27, 1996,
that makes us know that--

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.830
It was released in Philadelphia
probably on December 13, 1996.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.674
And was seen sequentially
after that in--

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.591
San Francisco, New Orleans...

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.069
Rio de Janeiro...

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.674
Rome, Kinshasa...

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.716
Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.031
That was very well done.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.755
If you're in there,
I have to talk to you!

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:12.909
It's the kidnap woman. The one
who was with the guy who tied us up.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.434
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the light!

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.353
- What's she doin'?
- She's drawing attention to us.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:23.036
I don't know what you're up to,
but you're gonna get us in deep shit.

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:26.157
Walkies ready,
batteries charged?

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.630
I saw you!
I saw somebody in there!

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:33.679
Secret experiments.
That's what they do.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.389
Secret, weird stuff.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.119
- Not just on animals.
- I know you.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.590
- Do 'em on people too down at--
- Have you seen James Cole?

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.750
They're watching you.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.910
- Takin' pictures.
- The police.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.911
I know. Look.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.271
I have to contact James.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.035
It's very, very important that
he's really careful when he reaches me.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.712
Do you understand that?

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:01.711
- Good.
- Who's James?

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.634
He was with me.
He spoke to you several weeks ago.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.599
He said that you were from the future
and that you were watching him.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.631
Bolt cutters.
Did you get the bolt cutters?

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.631
One dozen. They're in the van.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:26.191
- The plans for the security system?
- All right here, committed to memory.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.238
- You know what she's doin' out there?
- What's it say?

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.673
I can't see it.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:33.991
Forget about my psychiatrist
and concentrate on the task at hand.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.677
Your psychiatrist?

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.117
- Did you just say your psychiatrist?
- Ex-psychiatrist.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.952
This woman was your psychiatrist...

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.110
and now she's spray-painting
our building?

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.551
What's it say?

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.750
- What?
- There's a policeman over there.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.956
- Pretend you don't know me.
- I want to turn myself in.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.350
- Where is he?
-James! Down!

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.398
No, it's okay.
I'm not crazy any more.

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.109
I mean, I am. I'm mentally divergent.
I know that now.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.397
I want you to help me.
I want to get better.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.997
Let's get outta here.

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.877
He's going. Go!

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.559
- I've seen that before.
- No, you haven't.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.119
A guy in a Ford is chasing her
and some other guy I can't see.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.317
No problem. It's probably
just another kidnapping...

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.391
featuring Jeffrey's shrink.

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:01.517
Pardon me.
Make that ex-shrink.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.388
This is your leader?
A certifiable lunatic...

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.391
who told his former psychiatrist
all his plans...

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.755
for God knows what
wacko irresponsible schemes?

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.751
God knows what she's written
on that wall!

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.832
Who cares what psychiatrists
write on walls?

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:17.434
You think I told her about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.671
Impossible! Do you know why?
Do you know why?

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.115
Because,
you pathetically ineffectual...

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.749
and pusillanimous pretend friend
to animals, I'll tell you why.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.149
Because when I had anything
to do with her six years ago...

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.390
there was no such thing,
I hadn't thought of it yet.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.550
Then how come she knows
what's going on?

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:36.598
Well, here's my theory on that.

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:39.478
When I was institutionalized,
my brain was studied exhaustively...

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.278
in the guise of mental health.

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.557
I was interrogated, x-rayed.
I was examined thoroughly.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.794
Then they took everything about me
and put it into a computer...

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:51.314
where they created
this model of my mind.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.391
Yes! Using that model...

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.789
they managed to generate
every thought...

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.950
I could possibly have
in the next ten years...

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:01.555
which they then filtered through
a probability matrix of some kind...

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:05.474
to determine everything
I was gonna do in that period.

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.437
So, you see...

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.511
she knew I was gonna lead
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:12.592
into the pages of history
before it even occurred to me.

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.990
She knows everything I'm ever gonna do
before I know it myself.

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:17.991
How's that?

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.594
Kweskin, you finish here.
I'll meet you there.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:26.434
And if you forget one thing, I'll have
you shaved, sterilized and destroyed.

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.999
-Jeff?
- What?

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.548
You're a great man.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.551
Fuck the bozos!

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.472
He's seriously crazy.
You know that.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.312
There. Over there.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.311
Okay. Come on.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.470
- I need a room.
- Thirty-five bucks an hour.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.552
- An hour?
- You want quarter hours?

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.278
Go someplace else.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.672
Here's...

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:43.638
twenty-five, six, seven
for an hour.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:45.438
Deal?

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.953
One hour, honey babe.
Number 64.

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.838
Sixth floor.
Up the stairs, end of the hall.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:58.593
Elevator's busted.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.272
She's not "honey babe."

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.830
She's a doctor.
My psychiatrist.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:05.592
Understand?

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:10.313
Whatever gets it up for you,Jack.

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:21.279
Tommy, this is Charlie
over at the Globe.

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.391
You know if Wallace
has a new girl?

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:28.712
Sort of a rookie type?
A little weird? Does fantasy acts?

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.395
Okay, you were standing there
looking up at the moon.

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.438
You were splashing through the water,
and then what?

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.156
I thought I was in prison again.

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.515
Just like that,
you were in prison?

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:44.068
No, not really.

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:46.754
Like you said,
it was all in my mind.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.998
You disappeared.

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.197
One minute you were there,
the next minute you were gone.

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.475
Did you run through the woods, or--

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.473
I don't know.
I don't remember.

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:04.276
The boy in the well.
How did you know that was just a hoax?

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.596
It was?
I didn't know.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.318
You said he was hiding
in a barn!

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.391
I think I maybe saw a TV show
about that...

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.596
when I was a kid where a boy--

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.750
It wasn't a TV show!
It was real!

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.832
Maybe this boy saw
the same TV show that I did...

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.751
and he copied it.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:25.515
Look, you were right.
I am mentally ill.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.795
I imagined all these things,
these people.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.348
I know they're not real.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.908
I can trick them.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.275
I can make them do what I want.
I worked on 'em a little bit.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.476
I got back here to get better.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.997
- I can stay here.
- What does this mean to you?

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.076
I think I had a dream
about this.

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.474
You had a bullet from World War I
in your leg. How did it get there?

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.189
I don't know. You said I had delusions,
that I created this world.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:05.511
- You said you could explain.
- I can't!

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.717
I'm trying to, and--

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.315
I can't believe that everything
we say or do has already happened.

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.396
We can't change
what's gonna happen.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:19.189
And if five billion people
are gonna die, it's--

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.396
I want the future to be unknown.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.671
I want to become
a whole person again.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.111
I want this to be the present.

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.519
I want to stay here this time...

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:36.828
with you.

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.150
Do you remember six years ago
you had a phone number?

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.754
- It was the wrong number then.
- A woman answered.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.799
It was the wrong number in 1990.
It should be the right number now.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.075
Do you remember it?

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.229
The number.

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.159
This is my territory, bitch!

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.637
- Is this real or one of my delusions?
- This is definitely real.

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:39.352
Excuse me. I think we've got
a little misunderstanding here.

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:42.318
- Yeah. We--
- Gee, really?

01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:45.278
Now, you just sit tight, chief.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.352
You listen to me,
little Miss Understanding.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.591
You think you can go around me and
peddle your ass in this part of town?

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.796
You bet your life we got
what I would call...

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.950
a major fuckin' misunderstanding.

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:01.111
James, no! Don't!

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.911
Put him in the closet.
Take his money first!

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.753
- You want me to rob him?
- We need cash!

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:14.071
Call the cops!
Call the cops!

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.799
What's goin' on?

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.155
I've got friends, man.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.515
Don't fuckin' kill me.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.955
No,James!

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.552
Open the door!

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:30.234
What the fuck are you doing?

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.278
Please don't hurt him.
Open the door.

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.271
James, come on.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.431
Just in case--

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.354
Just in case I'm not crazy,
this is how they find us.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:51.273
By our teeth.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.920
I don't want them to find me ever.

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.273
I don't want to go back.

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:07.677
Step back.
You'd better load.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.671
Police! Throw your weapons out
and come on out!

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.551
Hey! Is that the cops?

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.358
I'm the innocent victim here.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.034
I was attacked
by a coked-up whore...

01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.032
and a fuckin' crazy dentist.

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:43.511
Try to blend in.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.831
Oh,Jesus!
Come on.

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.392
There's gotta be a phone
around here somewhere.

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.710
Over there. Look.

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:55.836
I'm gonna try that number, okay?

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.831
Let's hope it's nothing.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.750
It's okay! We're insane.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.956
We're crazy.
It's a carpet cleaning company.

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.395
- A carpet cleaning company?
- Yeah. No superiors.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.472
No scientists.
No men from the future.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:38.358
It's just a carpet cleaning company.
They have voice mail.

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.352
You leave a message telling
where you want your carpet cleaned.

01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.749
- You left them a message?
- Yeah, I couldn't resist.

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.956
Wait till they hear this nutty woman
telling them to watch out...

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:49.157
for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:52.835
I said, "The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue--"

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:56.595
"Is the secret headquarters of
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.148
They're the ones
who are gonna do it.

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:01.993
I can't do anything more now.
I have to go.

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.435
Have a merry Christmas.''

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.711
You couldn't have heard me.

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:17.471
They got your message.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.713
They played it for me.

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:24.917
It was a bad recording, distorted.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:28.631
I didn't recognize your voice.

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:49.119
This.

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.918
And this.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.200
And this.

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.191
Is everything okay?
You want anything?

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:04.751
Shall I put this
on your account, ma'am?

01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:06.990
No. That'll be cash.

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:13.231
Can you tell me what floor
the wigs are on?

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:26.154
You turned the thing
into a fucking computer.

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.708
- And Fale believed it.
- You know Fale.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.032
He's like, "If you guys get nailed,
which I'm pretty sure you will...

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.953
I've never seen you before
in my fuckin' life.''

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.070
Come on, come on.

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:43.878
Bring him through.

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:47.955
Drive!

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:55.832
What's the harm in openin' up the bag?
His eyes are taped, right?

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.799
Right?

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.511
Hello. Hello.

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.991
Wanna hear the monkey speak?

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.636
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, I know that's you.

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:17.915
- I recognize your voice.
- No, you don't.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.231
I also know all about
your warped little plan.

01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:23.356
That lady, your psychiatrist?

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.795
She told me.
I didn't believe her.

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.031
It just seemed too crazy,
even for you.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.509
But just in case, I took steps...

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.830
to make sure that
you couldn't go through with it.

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.992
I don't have the code any more.

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.196
I don't have access
to the virus.

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.317
I took myself out of the loop.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.119
Too late! Too late!

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.156
We've got plans for you, Dad.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:59.076
I never let myself believe it.
Now I know it's true.

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.071
Jeffrey?

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:03.594
You're completely insane.

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:10.190
No, I'm not.

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:17.319
<i>There's a cross section of one of</i>
<i>the old trees that's been cut down.</i>

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.671
<i>Here I was born.</i>

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.674
<i>And there I died.</i>

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.149
<i>It was only a moment for you.</i>

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.151
<i>You took no notice.</i>

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:43.354
I think I've seen this movie before.

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:47.069
- When I was a kid, I saw it on TV.
- Don't talk.

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:50.038
- I did see it before.
- <i>Tall trees.</i>

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:51.838
<i>Have you been here before?</i>

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:53.512
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- When?</i>

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:58.237
- But I don't recognize this--
- <i>When were you born?</i>

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.038
- <i>Long ago.</i>
- <i>Where?</i>

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:01.917
What's the matter?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.150
<i>Tell me.</i>
<i>Madeleine, tell me.</i>

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.232
It's just like
what's happening with us.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.038
Like the past.

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:12.789
The movie never changes.
It can't change.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:17.271
But every time you see it, it seems
different because you're different.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.828
You see different things.

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.512
<i>Please don't ask me.</i>

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:24.433
If you can't change anything
because it's already happened...

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.431
you may as well
smell the flowers.

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.112
What flowers?

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.557
It's an expression.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.639
Why are you doing this?

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:50.153
I want to know why.

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.993
What if I'm wrong?
What if you're wrong?

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:55.071
What if I am crazy?

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:58.755
In a few weeks,
it will have started or it won't.

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:00.398
If there's still...

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:04.748
football games, traffic jams...

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.831
TV shows
and armed robberies...

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.717
we're going to be so glad...

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.791
that we'll be thrilled
to see the police.

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.677
<i>I'm responsible for you now.</i>

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.718
<i>The Chinese say</i>
<i>once you've saved a person's life...</i>

01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:17.711
<i>you're responsible for it forever,</i>
<i>so I'm committed.</i>

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.279
Do you have a plan?

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.316
<i>I have to know.</i>

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.311
<i>There's so little that I know.</i>

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:28.040
You said
you'd never seen the ocean.

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.670
Hurry up. Come on.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.238
Jeffrey?

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.235
You know I can't see.
Where are we?

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.232
Jeffrey? Please.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.511
We have 9:30 reservations
for Key West.

01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:33.237
I just didn't recognize you.

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.630
Well, you look
pretty different yourself.

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.191
It was always you.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:45.271
In my dream.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.871
It was always you.

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:56.271
I remember you like this.

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.078
You do?

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:00.469
I felt I've known you before.

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.836
I feel like I've always known you.

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.071
I'm so scared.

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.271
What time's your flight, friends?

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.635
- 9:30.
- Might be tight.

01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:59.190
Tight? No.
My watch says 7:30.

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.590
On your normal mornin', okay.
Plenty of time.

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:06.514
But today you gotta take into account
your Army of the Twelve Monkeys factor.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.068
What? What'd you say?

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.752
Twelve Monkeys.

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:13.718
In case you folks didn't turn on
your radio this mornin'.

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:17.110
Bunch of weirdos let
all the animals out of the zoo.

01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.998
Then they locked up this
big-shot scientist in one of the cages.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.469
Scientist's own kid
one of the ones did it.

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.075
They've got animals
all over the place.

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.833
Bunch of zebras closed down
the thruway about an hour ago.

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.115
And they got some thing
called an emu.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:35.193
It's got traffic blocked
for miles on 676.

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.589
<i>What do they think they're accomplishing</i>
<i>by releasing an animal like this...</i>

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.513
<i>into a city like this one?</i>

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.875
That's what they were up to--
freeing animals.

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:47.272
On the walls. It said, "We did it."
They meant the animals.

01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:58.599
I think it's gonna be all right.

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:05.395
Tell your people if they spot either one
of them not to try and apprehend them.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.994
They should notify us.
We have people all over the airport.

01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.036
We'll take care of it.

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.440
- I know this place.
- Airports all look the same.

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:40.352
This is my dream.

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.349
- Your moustache.
- It's not just my dream.

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:51.480
I was actually here.
I remember now.

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.158
About a week or two
before everyone started dying.

01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:02.037
Careful.
They might be looking for us.

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:05.396
- I was here as a kid.
- Use this.

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.916
I think you were here then too.

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:12.470
If they identify us,
they're going to send us someplace...

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.471
but it won't be Key West.

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.398
I'll go fix this.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:23.756
I'm gonna get the tickets.
I'll meet you in the newspaper stand.

01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:38.232
Judy Simmons.
I have reservations for Key West.

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.196
- I don't see a lot of this. It's cash.
- It's a long story.

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:54.475
We'll begin boarding
in about 20 minutes.

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.755
- You have a nice flight, Miss Simmons.
- Thank you.

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.396
Hello. How are you today?

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.950
I don't know whether
you're there or not.

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.031
Maybe you just clean carpets.

01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:13.078
If you do, you're lucky.
You're gonna live a long, happy life.

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:15.515
But if you other guys are out there,
if you're picking this up...

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:17.636
forget about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:20.632
They didn't do it. It was a mistake.
Someone else did it.

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:22.915
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys
is just a bunch of dumb kids...

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.991
playing revolutionaries.

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:32.192
Listen, I've done my job.
I did what you wanted.

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:34.669
Good luck.
I'm not coming back.

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.071
San Francisco, New Orleans...

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:40.958
Rio de Janeiro, Rome...

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.237
Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok and Peking.

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.357
This is some trip you're taking, sir.
Is this all in one week?

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.510
Business.

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.875
Have a good one, sir.

01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.999
Got yourself a prob, Bob?

01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.473
Leave me alone!

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.710
I made a report.
I didn't have to do that.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:16.392
Point of fact:

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.755
You don't belong here.

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:21.798
It's not permitted to let you stay.

01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.996
This is the present.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:27.197
This is not the past.
This is not the future.

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.713
This is right now!

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.360
I'm not leaving! Get that?

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:34.159
You can't stop me.

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.674
Anything you say, chief.
It's none of my business.

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:49.070
- Hey, Cole.
- Leave me alone!

01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:51.071
Calm down, Cole. It's me.

01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:53.071
Cole, it's me.

01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:58.753
-Jose?
- Yeah, right,Jose.

01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:02.230
Why'd you pull out the tooth?
That was nuts.

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:05.232
- Here, take this.
- What for? Are you crazy?

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:06.753
Me? Are you kidding?

01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:10.389
You're the one.
You're a hero, man.

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:13.278
They pardoned you, and you
come back and fuck with your teeth.

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.397
- How did you find me?
- The phone call, man.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.914
They did their
reconstruction thing on it.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.913
The phone--
The phone call I just made?

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.275
- Five minutes ago.
- Yeah, five minutes ago.

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:28.079
Thirty years ago.
They just put it together.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:30.071
"Uh, hey, this is Cole,James.

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:32.549
I don't know whether you're there
or not. Maybe you just clean carpets.''

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:34.437
Where'd you get that from?

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:37.910
"Forget about the Army
of the Twelve Monkeys."

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.719
Man, if only they could've
got your message earlier.

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:43.075
Take it. You could still be
a hero if you cooperate!

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:46.551
Come on,James.
It's okay.

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:01.439
- $6.50's your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:16.112
<i>Flight 784 for San Francisco</i>
<i>is ready for boarding at gate 38.</i>

01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:22.510
Oh, my God!

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:26.434
I got orders to shoot the lady
if you don't go along this time.

01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.158
- What?
- Yeah, you got that?

01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:30.754
- They said, "If Cole don't obey--"
- I'll break your fuckin' head!

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.558
You hear me?

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:36.917
<i>Volunteers now boarding</i>
<i>at gate 37.</i>

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.710
You see?
I had no choice.

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:43.951
These are my orders, man.
Just take it.

01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.234
Take it!

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:52.192
This part isn't about
the virus at all, is it?

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:56.068
It's about following orders,
about doing what you're told.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:59.152
Hey, man, you got a pardon.
What do you want?

01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:02.277
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Who am I supposed to shoot?

01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.635
James! It's Dr Goines' assistant.

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:07.871
He's an apocalypse nut.
I think he's involved.

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:10.474
The next flight to San Francisco
leaves from gate 38.

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.676
If he's there,
I'm sure he's part of it.

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:24.870
Mr Holtz, you wanna have
a look at this, please?

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:31.038
Sir, would you mind letting me have
a look at the contents of your bag?

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:33.111
We don't have time for this.

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:35.589
Excuse me.

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:42.320
Biological samples.

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.391
I have the papers right here.

01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:48.870
I'm gonna have to ask you
to open this up, sir.

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:50.996
Open it?

01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:53.230
Why, yes, of course.

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:57.710
What could be better?
Look at the planes. Hurry up.

01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:00.917
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am, you have to get in the line.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.672
You see?

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:05.433
Biological.
Check the papers.

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.353
It's all proper.
I have a permit.

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:16.551
- It's empty.
- Well, yes, to be sure.

01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:21.395
It looks empty,
but I assure you, it's not.

01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:23.391
- You don't understand.
- I don't have to.

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.439
This is very important.
There's a man carrying a deadly virus.

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:32.230
There, you see?
Also invisible to the naked eye.

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:38.718
It doesn't even have an odour.

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.031
That's not necessary, sir.
There you go.

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:45.237
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a good flight.

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:56.277
- Who are you calling a moron?
- I am calling you a fucking moron!

01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:58.715
- A fucking moron?
- Get your hands off her!

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:03.711
Hold it!
Wait a moment.

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:21.720
There he is! That man!
He's carrying a deadly virus!

01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:24.553
Stop him!
Somebody, please stop him!

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:27.748
Police officer.

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.791
He's got a gun!

01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:44.352
Watch it!

01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:56.397
Freeze!

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:09.912
Excuse me.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.831
It's obscene.

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:14.229
All the violence,
all the lunacy.

01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:17.997
Shootings even at airports now.

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.675
You might say that we're
the next endangered species.

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.671
Human beings.

01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:28.589
I think you're right, ma'am.

01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:32.673
I think you've hit the nail
on the head.

01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:36.751
Jones is my name.

01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:44.068
I'm in insurance.
