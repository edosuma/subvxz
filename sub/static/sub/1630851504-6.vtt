04:13.419 --> 04:15.078
is over the years,
collector cars,

04:15.162 --> 04:16.997
it's usually the convertibles

early generation Mustangs,

34:55.676 --> 34:58.345
Danny doesn't exactly know
he paid for most of it.

34:58.504 --> 35:00.597
So I really hope he digs it.

35:00.756 --> 35:03.517
- So, I wanted you guys
to see Horny Mike's bike.

35:03.676 --> 35:05.426
- Finished?
- Finished.

35:05.511 --> 35:07.187
- Not parts scattered
all over the shop?

35:07.271 --> 35:09.681
- I've been killing myself
with Mike to get it done.

35:09.765 --> 35:11.266
- Helping him
or did you build the bike?

35:11.359 --> 35:13.017
- No, no, I didn't build it.
It's all his idea.

35:13.102 --> 35:14.936
I just made things work

35:15.020 --> 35:17.114
'cause you know Mikey
gets kind of confused.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.367
- So this is an airbrush artist
trying to build a motorcycle.

35:20.526 --> 35:21.952
Is that what you're telling us?

35:22.111 --> 35:23.945
- Well, I don't think you can
call it a motorcycle anymore.

35:24.029 --> 35:26.030
- Masterpiece.
- It's a work of art.

35:26.115 --> 35:28.792
It's almost like a Lego starter
kit for the mentally insane.

35:28.951 --> 35:30.285
- Yeah?

35:30.369 --> 35:33.454
Shannon, how much of this
insanity were you a part of?

35:33.548 --> 35:35.215
- Look, I made sure
the bike runs.

35:35.374 --> 35:37.542
- Okay.
- Safety things.

35:37.626 --> 35:38.718
- I don't know about safety.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.053
We're throwing that
right out the window.

35:40.212 --> 35:41.304
Don't even think it's safe.

35:41.463 --> 35:43.056
- Ryan?

35:43.141 --> 35:44.391
- All I did was give up space
in your paint shop.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.725
- Kev?

35:45.810 --> 35:48.219
- I signed a lot of
overtime checks for Bob.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.305
- [laughs]

35:50.389 --> 35:52.649
- Okay, so that means
I played a part in this, too.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.309
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you did.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.977
- Okay.
- It's impressive.

35:56.061 --> 35:57.395
- Every little chunk
that I've seen,

35:57.479 --> 35:58.989
I kind of scratched my head.

35:59.073 --> 36:00.732
I'm like, "I don't know what in
the world he's got going on."

36:00.816 --> 36:01.825
- Well, when it's together,
you still don't know

36:01.909 --> 36:04.327
what's going on, but it's there.

36:04.486 --> 36:05.403
- Why don't you tell him
to bring it out for you?

36:05.496 --> 36:06.496
- Me?
- Yeah.

36:06.655 --> 36:08.573
- Oh, no, no, no.
Dude, this is all you.

36:08.657 --> 36:10.584
- Say, Mike!

36:10.743 --> 36:13.411
Bring out that--whatever it is!

36:13.495 --> 36:15.505
- Oh, it's got plenty of lights.

36:15.590 --> 36:19.676
- Oh, my gosh.

36:19.760 --> 36:24.514
Got to be absolutely kidding me.

36:24.673 --> 36:28.009
Oh, my...

36:28.093 --> 36:31.179
- Now, I didn't have anything
to do with the outfit.

36:31.272 --> 36:34.682
- Oh, my gosh.
- What are you wearing?

36:34.767 --> 36:37.861
- Come on.
So what do you guys think?

36:38.020 --> 36:41.689
- It's a little low-key.
- On the back, too?

36:41.774 --> 36:44.201
- Oh, yeah, you know,
I'll give you a full ensemble.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.119
- Yeah.

36:46.278 --> 36:47.704
- I'm the brains behind it!

36:47.788 --> 36:50.031
- Oh, my God.

36:50.124 --> 36:53.534
- Dude, the brains.
Oh, my gosh, dude.

36:53.619 --> 36:56.120
Bro, right now you are my hero.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.457
<i>- Turning this 2005
Harley-Davidson Ultra Glide</i>

36:59.550 --> 37:03.136
<i>into the world's most badass
bike was a monumental job.</i>

37:03.221 --> 37:06.547
I scanned, sculpted,
sketched, and 3D printed

37:06.641 --> 37:09.133
<i>16 massive parts
that make this bike</i>

37:09.227 --> 37:11.469
<i>more of an artistic sculpture

37:11.562 --> 37:13.396
<i>It's a jaw-dropper.</i>

37:13.555 --> 37:15.556
<i>There's some high-tech
horniness in this beast, too.</i>

37:15.641 --> 37:17.734
<i>It's got a wireless

37:17.893 --> 37:20.070

37:20.154 --> 37:23.240
<i>And more importantly,

37:23.324 --> 37:25.733

37:37.171 --> 37:40.415
- Look at the copper leaf
on that just glow in the sun.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.750
That's all copper.
- It's amazing.

37:42.835 --> 37:44.419
- That's all copper leaf.

37:44.503 --> 37:46.254
- Was this all done like
on the--

37:46.338 --> 37:47.755
- This is the 3D printer.

37:47.840 --> 37:51.759
- The 3D printer machine?
Workmanship in this staggering.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.261
- The eyes are the headlights?
- Yeah.

37:53.345 --> 37:54.429
- Like projector?

37:54.513 --> 37:57.265
- Not only the headlights.
Let me show you.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.851
- Get out of here.
The halo?

37:59.935 --> 38:02.854
- That's just your sinister,
you know, park it in a lot.

38:02.938 --> 38:04.605
- That's a haunted house
on wheels.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.107
- That's got
to be illegal somehow.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.359
- [laughs]

38:08.444 --> 38:11.705
- Those lids still work?
- Show him, Bobby.

38:11.864 --> 38:13.957
- You're kidding me.

38:14.041 --> 38:15.867
You're kidding me.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.118
All: Oh!
- And they do that.

38:17.202 --> 38:19.370
- Look at that!

38:19.455 --> 38:21.456
- You've got to be kidding.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.458
- How do you transport
this thing, Mike?

38:23.551 --> 38:24.968
- I'll figure
that one out later.

38:25.127 --> 38:26.461
- Yeah.

38:26.545 --> 38:29.047
- That's so cool.

38:29.131 --> 38:30.798
- And that's a license plate
back there?

38:30.891 --> 38:32.058
- Oh, yeah.
Come here, come here.

38:32.217 --> 38:33.560
So you got your taillights.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.395
- Dude, look at this dude
he back.

38:35.554 --> 38:37.397
- Talk, baby.
- Oh, get out.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.482
Get out.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.650
You're kidding me.

38:40.809 --> 38:41.985
- That is hilarious.

38:42.069 --> 38:43.644
- Can you stand over here?

38:43.738 --> 38:45.897
I ain't trying to
get--check it out.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.157
- Whoa.
- Hey!

38:47.316 --> 38:49.659
- What?

38:49.744 --> 38:52.996
[laughing]

38:53.155 --> 38:55.999
That's like 20 feet.

38:56.083 --> 38:59.160
- This is
absolutely unbelievable.

38:59.244 --> 39:00.920
- Check this out.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.414
This is what
controls the entire bike.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.425
- Ghetto's doing this
with a phone right now,

39:05.509 --> 39:07.427
but when you're riding and you
want to be able to do that,

39:07.586 --> 39:08.428
you can just do it right there.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.004
- Yep.

39:10.089 --> 39:11.422
- That's crazy.

39:11.515 --> 39:15.935
On top of all of this amazing
craftsmanship, the paint.

39:16.095 --> 39:17.687
- You know, he helped me out

39:17.772 --> 39:19.931
with, you know,
finding the right color.

39:20.015 --> 39:23.518
- I do know that I've never
in my entire career

39:23.602 --> 39:27.772
known of a motorcycle
to use three gallons of paint.

39:27.856 --> 39:30.525
Not primer, paint.
- Wow.

39:30.609 --> 39:32.860
I'm still speechless.
I'm still speechless.

39:32.953 --> 39:34.871
From the second
I saw it roll out,

39:34.955 --> 39:36.948
I didn't know what to say.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.534
I'm standing here with it.
I still don't know what to say.

39:39.618 --> 39:42.120
I was determined.
I was bound and determined.

39:42.204 --> 39:44.122
I was going to pick on you
when this bike came out.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.124
- What?
- I can't.

39:46.208 --> 39:50.461
I could not be more proud
that this came out of our shop.

39:50.546 --> 39:53.297
This just shows that literally
anything can be done here.

39:53.382 --> 39:56.559
- This is where you come
if you really want custom!

39:56.718 --> 39:59.720
- There is nothing like this
in the world.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.398
- Can I just say,
you want to know why?

40:01.482 --> 40:02.557
- Tell me.

40:02.641 --> 40:05.059
- Because I work
at an incredible shop

40:05.144 --> 40:07.895
with incredible people.

40:07.980 --> 40:10.481
- Amen, brother.
I want to get my bike out.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.400
I just want to see this thing
go down the road.

40:12.493 --> 40:13.985
Plus, I want to be
on my own bike,

40:14.069 --> 40:15.995
so when the cops come up,
I can just ditch it.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.914
I can just go.

40:17.998 --> 40:20.500
You know, we all give Mike
a hard time,

40:20.659 --> 40:23.002
but there's no denying
his artistry,

40:23.162 --> 40:24.745
ingenuity, creativity, man,

40:24.839 --> 40:27.590
they're all surpassed
by his complete insanity!

40:27.675 --> 40:31.511
That is the wildest motorcycle
I've ever seen!

40:31.670 --> 40:33.838
And we are so lucky
to have him, man!

40:33.931 --> 40:35.515
He is a maniac!

40:35.599 --> 40:37.767
And I'm glad
that he's our maniac.
