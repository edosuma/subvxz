00:04.613 --> 00:08.627
Okay, okay, please, please,
take your seats.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.500
Leave your booklets closed

00:10.500 --> 00:12.967
and your pencils down
until I tell you to begin.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.074

00:43.666 --> 00:45.299
Principal MacDonald?

00:45.301 --> 00:46.697
Yeah, come on in.

00:48.604 --> 00:51.205
These are the exams from first period.

00:51.207 --> 00:54.041
Thanks, Lacey. Uh, any irregularities?

00:56.165 --> 00:57.611
What?

00:59.015 --> 01:00.481
Tyler Young.

01:00.483 --> 01:02.516
I got him admission and a scholarship

01:02.518 --> 01:04.718
up at Hudson College next year.

01:05.215 --> 01:08.322
It's contingent upon these scores, and...

01:08.324 --> 01:10.491
if he fails...

01:12.862 --> 01:16.351
Is there any way
I could look at his test?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.768
By law... I have to certify

01:20.770 --> 01:23.637
that I've locked these tests in a safe

01:23.639 --> 01:25.472
no later than ten minutes

01:25.474 --> 01:27.174
after the conclusion of the exam.

01:27.446 --> 01:29.109
No one can see them

01:29.111 --> 01:31.312
or touch them

01:31.314 --> 01:35.049
until the courier
from the testing service

01:35.051 --> 01:37.218
picks them up in the morning.

01:38.721 --> 01:40.888
But what happens

01:40.890 --> 01:43.420
after I leave for the day...

01:44.727 --> 01:46.894
well, I wouldn't know about that.

02:09.952 --> 02:11.385
Can I help you?

02:17.126 --> 02:18.792
No.

02:21.631 --> 02:23.731
Yeah, um...

02:23.733 --> 02:25.165
I need one test.

02:25.167 --> 02:26.567
Tyler Young.

02:26.569 --> 02:28.235
<i>I must say, Marissa,</i>

02:28.237 --> 02:30.137
you look absolutely beautiful.

02:30.139 --> 02:31.972
But I'm sure Kyle's
already told you that.

02:31.974 --> 02:34.375
Yes. He told me I looked
beautiful in the shower.

02:34.377 --> 02:36.377
Told me I looked beautiful
in my underwear.

02:36.379 --> 02:38.712
And then he told me
I looked beautiful in my dress.

02:38.714 --> 02:40.347
I couldn't help but notice his

02:40.349 --> 02:42.650
sense of conviction diminishing
the more clothes I put on.

02:42.652 --> 02:44.318
Hmm, men. What's our problem?

02:44.320 --> 02:45.686
Bull. Dr. Jason Bull.

02:45.688 --> 02:47.154
Why are we here again?

02:47.156 --> 02:49.490
I thought you swore last year
you were never coming back.

02:49.492 --> 02:51.425
And I meant it. Oh, wait a second.

02:51.427 --> 02:53.861
Is this the mayor's annual
"You Scratch My Back,

02:53.863 --> 02:56.563
I Have No Idea Who You Are
Fundraising Gala"?

02:57.077 --> 02:58.751
Don't you think you've had enough?

02:58.753 --> 03:01.035
- Astonishingly, no.
- Come on, folks.

03:01.037 --> 03:03.504
- I can still hear this guy's voice.
- ...into our kids' college funds.

03:03.506 --> 03:06.040
Now here's a truly New York experience:

03:06.042 --> 03:08.676
a private carriage ride
through Central Park

03:08.678 --> 03:10.711
with Mayor Hopkins herself.

03:10.713 --> 03:12.446
What do you say we kick this one off

03:12.448 --> 03:13.814
at $2,000?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.216
$2,000, anyone?

03:16.218 --> 03:17.484
Oh, God.

03:17.486 --> 03:19.186
Hey, what are you doing?
Someone's got to have $2,000.

03:19.188 --> 03:20.772
It's worth two grand to shut this guy up.

03:20.797 --> 03:21.989
It's practically a steal.

03:21.991 --> 03:23.357
$2,000, from the gentleman

03:23.359 --> 03:26.260
- in the glasses. Now do I see three?
- Ta-da.

03:26.262 --> 03:27.728
- Auction over.
- $3,000?

03:27.730 --> 03:29.296
$3,000, in the back.

03:29.298 --> 03:31.465
Now do I hear four?

03:31.467 --> 03:33.534
Do I hear four? Do I hear four?

03:33.536 --> 03:35.636
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I know when

03:35.638 --> 03:37.705
to bow out, I'm just
gonna run the price up.

03:37.707 --> 03:39.673
$4,000, from the man in the glasses.

03:39.675 --> 03:41.875
I can't believe this.

03:41.877 --> 03:43.944
$5,000 in the back, now. Do I hear six?

03:43.946 --> 03:45.212
We've got six.

03:45.214 --> 03:46.747
Thank you, Clark Kent.

03:46.749 --> 03:48.983
Is there a seven to be had?

03:48.985 --> 03:50.504
Do I hear seven?

03:50.506 --> 03:52.353
Seven. Do I hear eight? $8,000?

03:52.355 --> 03:54.822
- Bull, stop.
- Trust me, I know when to get out.

03:54.824 --> 03:56.623
- This is my last bid.
- Eight, anyone? $8,000!

03:56.625 --> 03:59.860
Can I get nine? In the back.

03:59.862 --> 04:02.696
$9,000. $9,000 once,

04:02.698 --> 04:07.067
$9,000 twice, sold to the man in the back

04:07.069 --> 04:07.968
for $9,000.

04:07.970 --> 04:09.536
See?

04:09.538 --> 04:12.006
Do I know what I know
or do I know what I know?

04:12.008 --> 04:14.108
I don't know.

04:16.512 --> 04:19.346
Ladies and gentlemen,
Your Honor the mayor

04:19.348 --> 04:21.949
was so moved by this
outpouring of generosity

04:21.951 --> 04:24.985
that she has agreed to take time for two

04:24.987 --> 04:26.387
carriage rides.

04:26.389 --> 04:28.822
One to the man in the back for $9,000,

04:28.824 --> 04:31.392
and to the gentleman
in the glasses for eight.

04:31.394 --> 04:34.561
Oh, yeah...

04:36.966 --> 04:38.799
Dr. Bull.

04:38.801 --> 04:41.802
Dr. Jason Bull?

04:41.804 --> 04:43.037
Dr. Bull?

04:43.039 --> 04:45.372
John Powers. Chief of staff
for Mayor Hopkins.

04:45.374 --> 04:47.141
Thanks so much for jumping in out there.

04:47.143 --> 04:49.109
Page Six would've had
a field day if we couldn't

04:49.111 --> 04:51.078
sell a stroll through the park
with Her Honor.

04:52.048 --> 04:53.514
Happy to do it. In fact,

04:53.516 --> 04:55.416
nothing gives me greater
pleasure than writing a check

04:55.418 --> 04:57.384
for something I really don't need.

04:59.288 --> 05:01.622
Truth is, I was wondering

05:01.624 --> 05:03.891
if I could impose on you for, uh,

05:03.893 --> 05:04.992
one more thing? You've heard about

05:04.994 --> 05:07.327
the cheating scandal in the Bronx?

05:07.329 --> 05:10.738
Oh, yeah, last summer...
the teachers fixing tests?

05:10.740 --> 05:13.267
The, uh, teachers union
is representing the only teacher

05:13.269 --> 05:14.768
who's been charged so far.

05:14.770 --> 05:17.438
She's a passionate young
educator, who, in our opinion,

05:17.440 --> 05:19.840
is being railroaded by the
district attorney's office.

05:19.842 --> 05:23.177
Any way I could entice you
to take a meeting

05:23.179 --> 05:24.745
with the teacher and her lawyer?

05:24.747 --> 05:27.181
The mayor would be extremely
grateful for your help.

05:27.183 --> 05:29.316
I'm sure she would.
There are far more teachers

05:29.318 --> 05:31.852
who vote in elections
than district attorneys.

05:33.956 --> 05:36.290
Just e-mail me where to go
and when to be there.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.759
Um, and say hi to the mayor for me.

05:38.761 --> 05:41.228
Even though she probably
couldn't tell me from Adam.

05:41.230 --> 05:43.097
Uh, just say yes, Bull.

05:43.099 --> 05:44.494
Yes, Bull.

05:45.454 --> 05:47.401
Dr. Jason Bull?

05:50.606 --> 05:51.839
<i>So, what can I do</i>

05:51.841 --> 05:53.774
for you, Dr. Bull? Mayor's office said

05:53.776 --> 05:55.547
you'd be stopping by.

05:57.279 --> 05:58.745
You know who I am?

05:58.747 --> 06:00.380
I read <i>The New York Times.</i>

06:00.382 --> 06:02.583
You're a trial scientist.

06:02.585 --> 06:04.118
It's hard to tell...
the way you said that...

06:04.120 --> 06:05.285
just how you feel about it.

06:05.682 --> 06:07.421
Does the expression "third teat"

06:07.423 --> 06:08.622
clear it up for you?

06:08.624 --> 06:10.624
Mmm.

06:10.626 --> 06:12.397
It's open.

06:14.964 --> 06:18.098
Hi. Um... am I interrupting something?

06:18.100 --> 06:19.433
I was told to just knock.

06:19.435 --> 06:21.401
No, no. You're fine.

06:21.403 --> 06:24.271
Lacey Adams, Dr. Jason Bull.

06:24.743 --> 06:25.939
Doctor.

06:25.941 --> 06:27.641
Ms. Adams. It's nice to meet you.

06:27.643 --> 06:31.178
I'm a trial scientist.

06:31.180 --> 06:33.280
I assist lawyers and legal teams

06:33.282 --> 06:34.648
with challenging cases.

06:34.650 --> 06:36.283
The mayor's office wanted me to come by

06:36.285 --> 06:38.652
and meet you and your lawyer,

06:38.654 --> 06:40.454
see if I could be of any help.

06:40.456 --> 06:41.955
He can't.

06:43.720 --> 06:44.725
Gwen here.

06:45.514 --> 06:46.793
Mm-hmm.

06:46.795 --> 06:48.962
Mm-hmm. Sure.

06:48.964 --> 06:50.364
So...

06:50.366 --> 06:51.498
what'd they tell you

06:51.500 --> 06:53.400
- about me?
- Nothing.

06:53.402 --> 06:55.435
I just know what I've read...
you and five other teachers

06:55.437 --> 06:58.672
are accused of altering more
than 800 standardized tests.

06:58.674 --> 07:00.774
I changed one answer...

07:00.776 --> 07:02.609
on one test.

07:02.948 --> 07:04.745
One.

07:04.747 --> 07:06.117
For one kid.

07:06.882 --> 07:09.216
Wow. That must be one special kid.

07:09.218 --> 07:10.784
He's one of those kids everyone says

07:10.786 --> 07:12.519
is a lost cause.

07:12.521 --> 07:13.820
Terrible grades,

07:13.822 --> 07:15.377
attendance issues,

07:15.925 --> 07:17.191
no dad.

07:17.193 --> 07:20.011
And I think the mother
has a heroin problem.

07:20.596 --> 07:22.217
But in class?

07:22.731 --> 07:24.498
I can see the gears turning.

07:24.886 --> 07:26.266
I spent three years working with him...

07:26.268 --> 07:27.634
before school,

07:27.636 --> 07:31.038
after school... I brought him up
from a D to a B-plus.

07:31.309 --> 07:33.540
I even talked the admissions
counselor at Hudson College

07:33.542 --> 07:34.741
into accepting him.

07:35.146 --> 07:37.911
All he had to do was
get a 65 on his test.

07:37.913 --> 07:41.882
And it shouldn't have
been a problem, but...

07:41.884 --> 07:43.584
So let me get this straight...

07:43.586 --> 07:45.185
they could place all six of you
at the scene,

07:45.187 --> 07:47.354
and all of you were arrested, but...

07:47.356 --> 07:49.289
you are the only one being charged.

07:49.291 --> 07:50.857
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

07:52.094 --> 07:55.029
Because I confessed.

07:57.266 --> 07:59.838
That was the district attorney's office.

08:00.102 --> 08:01.335
They're offering a deal.

08:01.337 --> 08:04.404
They certainly are. You plead guilty,

08:04.406 --> 08:06.773
testify against the other five teachers,

08:06.775 --> 08:08.742
the ADA will give you probation.

08:08.744 --> 08:10.043
You'll serve no time.

08:10.045 --> 08:12.145
But she'll still have
a felony on her record.

08:12.147 --> 08:14.948
Which means they'll take away
your teaching license.

08:14.950 --> 08:16.550
What's the alternative?

08:16.552 --> 08:18.719
- You go to jail.
- The alternative

08:18.721 --> 08:20.420
is we go to court.

08:20.422 --> 08:22.289
We explain to a jury why you did

08:22.291 --> 08:24.524
what you did, and maybe, just maybe,

08:24.526 --> 08:26.960
you walk away from this, doing what

08:26.962 --> 08:28.328
you're meant to do.

08:28.330 --> 08:30.285
Which is obviously teach.

08:30.933 --> 08:32.366
And you'll be there?

08:32.368 --> 08:34.201
Part of the team?

08:34.203 --> 08:35.539
Absolutely.

08:36.171 --> 08:38.105
Can't have too many teats.

08:38.107 --> 08:39.806
Can you, Gwen?

08:42.578 --> 08:44.444
- What?
- Nothing.

08:56.648 --> 08:59.439
Lacey Adams, age 27. Graduated from Yale,

08:59.464 --> 09:01.364
did a one-year stint
with Teach for America.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.533
She has been at Woodrow
High School, in the Bronx,

09:03.535 --> 09:04.834
for the last three years.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.803
Went to Yale and works in a public school

09:06.805 --> 09:08.083
in the Bronx; that's commitment.

09:08.085 --> 09:09.873
Oh, it gets better. She works

09:09.875 --> 09:12.375
11-hour days, nets less than $700 a week,

09:12.377 --> 09:15.211
and buys school supplies
with her own money.

09:15.213 --> 09:17.981
I need to leave now so I can go
home and rethink my entire life.

09:17.983 --> 09:19.415
A group of teachers

09:19.417 --> 09:23.219
changes thousands of answers
on hundreds of tests.

09:23.221 --> 09:25.688
And supposedly this girl
only did it once.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.623
That's what she says.

09:26.625 --> 09:27.724
Uh-huh.

09:27.726 --> 09:30.260
- And we believe her?
- Bull believes her.

09:30.262 --> 09:32.595
He thinks she's a good teacher.
He thinks she's a good person.

09:32.597 --> 09:34.497
And he hates that she's
facing a decade in prison.

09:35.350 --> 09:36.566
He said,

09:36.568 --> 09:39.002
"In Lacey's mind, what
she did was justified.

09:39.004 --> 09:42.071
We just have to get the jurors
to accept that justification."

09:42.399 --> 09:44.174
Well, that's all, huh?

09:49.981 --> 09:51.748
You grew up around here?

09:52.492 --> 09:54.083
Uh, I grew up in Switzerland.

09:54.085 --> 09:56.252
Ah, I was close.

09:56.254 --> 09:58.288
My father works in international finance.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.490
Uh, they live in Massachusetts now.

10:00.492 --> 10:02.058
I mean, I am American.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.359
I was born here.

10:03.361 --> 10:04.994
But it wasn't until I went to Yale

10:04.996 --> 10:07.697
that I fell in love with the place.

10:07.699 --> 10:09.467
What about teaching?

10:09.768 --> 10:11.134
Did you get the notice?

10:11.136 --> 10:12.902
There's no money in it, Lacey.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.437
Yeah, I know.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.973
But, um, some of the most
important people in my life,

10:16.975 --> 10:19.978
growing up, were teachers.

10:21.104 --> 10:23.479
I remember when we moved to Europe.

10:23.481 --> 10:25.400
I was five years old.

10:26.317 --> 10:28.985
They speak four languages in Switzerland.

10:29.487 --> 10:31.020
None of them English.

10:31.022 --> 10:33.156
So the only person who understood me

10:33.158 --> 10:34.857
and the only person I could talk to,

10:34.859 --> 10:38.361
other than my mom and dad,
was my teacher.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.297
My fate was sealed.

10:44.536 --> 10:47.337
I'm in a lot of trouble,
aren't I, Dr. Bull?

10:47.339 --> 10:48.605
Yes.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.673
And no.

10:50.675 --> 10:52.609
I mean, you did do something
that was wrong.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.844
But it seems fairly obvious

10:54.846 --> 10:57.098
you did it for a very good reason.

10:57.766 --> 10:59.282
In fact, it seems pretty clear

10:59.284 --> 11:01.227
you did it to help someone else.

11:08.593 --> 11:11.394
God, I miss it.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.533
God, I miss them.

11:18.770 --> 11:20.121
I know.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.639
Knock, knock.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.241
How do you feel about necessity?

11:26.169 --> 11:27.710
I feel very strongly

11:27.712 --> 11:30.013
that it's the mother of invention.

11:30.015 --> 11:33.082
Ah. I mean as a trial strategy.

11:33.084 --> 11:34.917
I just spent the morning
with our mutual client

11:34.919 --> 11:36.753
and I think necessity
gives us what we need.

11:36.755 --> 11:40.223
You want to present a necessity defense?

11:40.225 --> 11:41.518
I do.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.603
Think about it.

11:43.928 --> 11:46.195
We're stuck with Lacey's confession.

11:46.197 --> 11:48.898
I mean, we can't claim she's not guilty.

11:48.900 --> 11:53.102
But we can turn a weakness
into a strength.

11:53.104 --> 11:57.006
We can demonstrate that Lacey's
cheating was a necessity.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.374
She did it to prevent Tyler's life

11:58.376 --> 12:01.010
from becoming a greater tragedy
than it already was.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.178
Okay.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.180
Dr. Bull, I know you're not a lawyer,

12:04.182 --> 12:06.883
but the necessity defense is intended

12:06.885 --> 12:09.018
for people trying to save lives.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.119
That's what Lacey was doing.

12:10.121 --> 12:11.321
An intruder breaks into your home

12:11.323 --> 12:13.222
and tries to kidnap your child,

12:13.224 --> 12:14.657
so you shoot him.

12:14.659 --> 12:16.059
That's necessity.

12:16.061 --> 12:19.362
That's why people mount
a necessity defense.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.832
It's not used to defend against
an allegation of fraud.

12:22.834 --> 12:24.434
And there's no precedent.

12:24.436 --> 12:26.035
Then let's make some precedent.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.904
- You're serious.
- Mmm.

12:27.906 --> 12:30.473
Well, that's all well and good,

12:30.475 --> 12:32.442
but I've already decided.

12:32.444 --> 12:34.977
We're going to argue that
standardized testing

12:34.979 --> 12:37.547
without regard to
socioeconomic inequality

12:37.549 --> 12:39.716
is just bad public policy.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.050
That's our defense.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.819
I want to put the entire notion

12:42.821 --> 12:44.220
of standardized testing

12:44.222 --> 12:45.755
on trial.

12:45.757 --> 12:47.690
- You do?
- Damn right.

12:48.251 --> 12:49.692
You ever get out of here?

12:49.694 --> 12:52.505
From under this mountain of paperwork?

12:53.756 --> 12:55.098
Why don't you come by my office?

12:55.100 --> 12:56.799
I'll show you what we do,

12:56.801 --> 13:00.236
and why I think our defense
is such a winner.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.405
<i>The jurors we should be looking for</i>

13:02.407 --> 13:03.682
are those who understand

13:03.684 --> 13:06.843
it's sometimes acceptable
to do something wrong

13:06.845 --> 13:08.811
in pursuit of something right.

13:08.813 --> 13:11.180
You're talking about Machiavellianism,

13:11.182 --> 13:13.483
as in Niccolo Machiavelli?

13:13.485 --> 13:14.717
Exactly.

13:14.719 --> 13:17.019
Machiavelli, 15th century

13:17.021 --> 13:19.856
politician and philosopher,
who believed it was absolutely

13:19.858 --> 13:23.726
fine to do the wrong thing, if
it was for the right reasons.

13:26.164 --> 13:29.332
Our task is to identify the jurors

13:29.334 --> 13:31.768
with the most Machiavellian tendencies

13:32.212 --> 13:34.504
and get them seated on that jury.

13:34.506 --> 13:36.572
Our task is to prove Lacey

13:36.574 --> 13:38.741
was put in an impossible situation

13:38.743 --> 13:40.910
by forces beyond her control,

13:40.912 --> 13:43.012
and did her best to navigate it.

13:43.014 --> 13:44.847
The rest of this is...

13:44.849 --> 13:47.350
Wait a minute. Is this a test?

13:48.420 --> 13:52.221
It's the Mach IV test
for Machiavellianism.

13:52.223 --> 13:54.590
"Agree or disagree?

13:54.592 --> 13:57.794
Honesty is the best policy in all cases."

13:57.796 --> 13:59.595
Mmm, I certainly agree with that.

13:59.597 --> 14:00.830
I don't.

14:00.832 --> 14:02.198
I don't believe you do either.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.749
Kids, no fighting at the table.

14:03.751 --> 14:05.401
We have a guest.

14:28.793 --> 14:30.560
Everybody ready to share?

14:30.562 --> 14:35.998
Remember, the higher the score,
the more Machiavellian you are.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.067
Well, I got a 44.

14:38.069 --> 14:39.569
Confirms what we already know.

14:39.571 --> 14:43.272
Save for your perverse talent
for violating people's privacy,

14:43.274 --> 14:45.174
and reading their most secret

14:45.176 --> 14:47.777
and intimate documents online,
you're fundamentally

14:47.779 --> 14:48.978
trustworthy and ethical.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.547
I hate that. Sounds so boring.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.486
- I got a 66.
- Spoken like a true Machiavellian.

14:55.488 --> 14:57.954
And right up there with my 72.

14:57.956 --> 14:59.889
- What'd you get?
- Uh, 62.

14:59.891 --> 15:02.725
- I guess we are a den of thieves.
- Hmm.

15:03.428 --> 15:06.629
And Mr. "Honesty is the best policy"?

15:06.631 --> 15:10.500
77. I'm not sure I even trust this test.

15:10.502 --> 15:12.869
38. And I trust it completely.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.070
Ms. Kinsey?

15:14.072 --> 15:17.507
34. Not that it matters.

15:18.776 --> 15:20.320
Well done, group.

15:20.812 --> 15:22.912
Is anyone else hungry?

15:22.914 --> 15:24.240
Yeah.

15:43.868 --> 15:47.470
Here are the questions I'd love
you to ask potential jurors.

15:47.472 --> 15:49.438
In addition, it's extremely important

15:49.440 --> 15:50.973
that you weave the word "necessity"

15:50.975 --> 15:53.543
into the conversation. I want the jurors

15:53.545 --> 15:55.211
to become very comfortable with that word

15:55.213 --> 15:57.079
and to start understanding
that that's what they need

15:57.081 --> 15:58.848
to measure Lacey's behavior against.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.184
Do me a favor and raise your hand

16:02.186 --> 16:04.353
if you agree with the following:

16:04.355 --> 16:07.823
"Most people are basically
good and kind."

16:12.497 --> 16:16.866
The defense would like to excuse
and thank jurors two and nine.

16:16.868 --> 16:19.235
"The best way to handle people

16:19.237 --> 16:20.937
is to tell them what they want to hear."

16:24.976 --> 16:28.277
Juror number five is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.613
Necessity.

16:31.516 --> 16:34.450
Again, raise your hand if you agree.

16:34.452 --> 16:37.053
"Generally speaking,
most people won't work hard

16:37.055 --> 16:39.655
unless it's an absolute necessity."

16:41.926 --> 16:45.695
Juror 12 is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

16:46.155 --> 16:48.264
Raise your hand if you believe

16:48.266 --> 16:51.467
there should be uniform
educational standards

16:51.469 --> 16:53.469
whether you live in Alaska or Wyoming,

16:53.471 --> 16:55.972
whether your child is rich or poor.

16:56.674 --> 16:58.374
She's going off script.

16:58.376 --> 17:00.409
So, then, I take it
you believe standardized tests

17:00.411 --> 17:02.945
are a necessary part of the curriculum?

17:02.947 --> 17:04.246
I do.

17:04.248 --> 17:06.015
Defense would like to thank
and excuse this juror.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.185
So ordered. And let me remind the defense

17:09.186 --> 17:11.420
that you have now exhausted
all your challenges.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.627
Mm.

17:18.630 --> 17:21.497
What? I said the word "necessity."

17:21.499 --> 17:23.065
You're not happy?

17:23.067 --> 17:24.666
I thought we had a plan.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.535
I thought we were working together.

17:26.537 --> 17:27.970
No.

17:27.972 --> 17:29.405
You had a plan.

17:29.407 --> 17:31.741
And you thought I was working for you.

17:31.743 --> 17:33.828
And now you know better.

17:37.582 --> 17:40.583
Rather Machiavellian, wouldn't you say?

18:10.426 --> 18:14.161
Tell me you are not going
through my personal papers.

18:16.932 --> 18:18.565
Sorry, can't do that.

18:18.567 --> 18:19.753
That's exactly what I'm doing.

18:19.755 --> 18:21.568
Okay, I need you to stop right now.

18:21.570 --> 18:23.737
I need you to get up,
get your clothes and leave.

18:23.739 --> 18:25.939
Are you mad at me?

18:25.941 --> 18:27.474
I am going to count to three,

18:27.476 --> 18:29.376
and if you are not out of that chair

18:29.378 --> 18:31.244
and getting your clothes,
I'm calling the police.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.596
Out of the chair.

18:34.383 --> 18:36.516
But I was just looking through this stuff

18:36.518 --> 18:38.518
because I'm worried about you.

18:38.854 --> 18:41.121
Marissa... I'm a money guy.

18:41.123 --> 18:42.956
That's what I do.

18:42.958 --> 18:45.158
And, uh, you won't let
me take care of you.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.095
Half the time, you won't let me
pay for dinner, and I get it.

18:48.097 --> 18:49.496
That's what works for you,

18:49.498 --> 18:52.933
but I am who I am and I need
to know you're okay.

18:52.935 --> 18:55.936
That you're set for the future,
and you're not.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.912
That's my business.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.040
You're halfway through your working life

19:00.042 --> 19:01.958
and you have nothing put away.

19:02.277 --> 19:03.876
Less than a hundred grand.

19:04.446 --> 19:07.114
And I know, I see, that you're
paying for your mom

19:07.116 --> 19:10.350
to live in that nice place
in Massachusetts.

19:10.352 --> 19:12.385
You've got this great apartment.

19:12.387 --> 19:14.054
You're running some credit card debt.

19:14.056 --> 19:15.125
I need you to leave.

19:15.127 --> 19:16.824
I will leave in two minutes.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.475
I just, I want you to know...

19:20.062 --> 19:23.597
I can make room for you
in my Queens project.

19:23.599 --> 19:27.264
Push some of the Chinese money
aside and make room for you.

19:27.264 --> 19:30.498
Take your 75 grand and turn
it into 350 in 18 months.

19:31.279 --> 19:33.184
And it would give me

19:33.186 --> 19:35.491
enormous pleasure to do that, it would.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.274
'Cause I care about you.

19:51.388 --> 19:52.721
Wow.

19:53.634 --> 19:55.924
This is impressive.

19:55.926 --> 19:58.693
I didn't know something
like this even existed.

19:58.695 --> 20:01.726
I'm very proud of this.

20:02.602 --> 20:06.701
By the way, we finally
made contact with Tyler.

20:07.398 --> 20:08.770
Turns out he is the prosecution's

20:08.772 --> 20:10.739
first witness tomorrow.

20:10.741 --> 20:12.140
He's coming in tonight to get prepped.

20:12.142 --> 20:14.075
That's great.

20:14.077 --> 20:16.544
Um, how is he?

20:17.033 --> 20:17.879
Um, is he okay?

20:17.881 --> 20:19.381
Did he get some kind of job?

20:19.383 --> 20:20.782
I mean, I feel terrible

20:20.784 --> 20:23.051
that I'm putting him
through all this trouble.

20:23.053 --> 20:24.819
That's funny. He was worried about you.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.023
He said if he, uh, had done better

20:28.025 --> 20:30.458
on the test, none of this
would have happened.

20:30.460 --> 20:31.993
So...

20:31.995 --> 20:33.762
you mind if I ask you a question?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.932
You can ask me any question
you'd like, Dr. Bull.

20:37.386 --> 20:38.867
You come from money.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.803
Is that a question or an accusation?

20:41.805 --> 20:43.705
Just a fact.

20:44.518 --> 20:46.474
It makes your choice of
profession even more laudable,

20:46.476 --> 20:49.044
but it does beg the question...

20:49.315 --> 20:51.579
why do you have a union lawyer?

20:51.817 --> 20:53.915
Hmm? Why aren't you being represented

20:53.917 --> 20:55.884
by some high-priced firm

20:55.886 --> 20:58.720
that has the DA's
private cell phone number

20:58.722 --> 21:01.723
and can maybe make this
whole thing go away?

21:03.387 --> 21:05.287
Are your parents unwilling to help you?

21:05.665 --> 21:08.123
Do they understand...
do you understand...

21:08.542 --> 21:10.458
you could go to prison for ten years?

21:10.460 --> 21:12.761
The ADA is looking to make
an example out of you

21:12.763 --> 21:15.263
and those five other teachers.

21:15.265 --> 21:17.799
He is not fooling around.

21:19.637 --> 21:21.269
My parents didn't walk into that room

21:21.271 --> 21:23.171
and change the test question.

21:23.591 --> 21:24.639
I did.

21:24.641 --> 21:25.974
And I'm sure you won't
be surprised to hear

21:25.976 --> 21:27.242
that they were not too thrilled

21:27.244 --> 21:29.978
at the idea of me becoming a teacher.

21:30.439 --> 21:31.947
A public school teacher...

21:31.949 --> 21:34.883
in New York, in the Bronx.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.620
I'm an adult, Dr. Bull.

21:38.622 --> 21:41.022
I make my own choices, I pay my own way,

21:41.024 --> 21:43.285
and I'm willing to pay
for the consequences.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.560
I meant what I said

21:45.562 --> 21:47.957
when I told you I was
grateful for your help.

21:48.632 --> 21:53.468
But I understand if you feel
that this is a fool's errand.

21:53.470 --> 21:55.089
Not at all.

21:56.132 --> 21:57.205
I'm just trying to figure out

21:57.207 --> 21:59.574
if you're a saint or
a misbegotten martyr.

22:05.148 --> 22:06.848
<i>Mr. Young.</i>

22:06.850 --> 22:08.750
What did you offer to do in return

22:08.752 --> 22:11.188
for Ms. Adams changing your test grade?

22:11.955 --> 22:13.221
I didn't offer to do anything.

22:13.223 --> 22:14.856
I didn't even know she was gonna do it.

22:14.858 --> 22:17.125
She didn't even tell me she
was gonna change that answer.

22:17.611 --> 22:19.628
I didn't even find out
until she got arrested

22:19.630 --> 22:21.696
and the school called to tell me
my scholarship was no good,

22:21.698 --> 22:23.732
and that I couldn't go there anymore.

22:23.734 --> 22:26.067
And when that happened, were you mad?

22:26.069 --> 22:27.235
I was really...

22:27.237 --> 22:28.603
confused.

22:29.123 --> 22:31.206
Never mad. Sad.

22:31.625 --> 22:33.708
'Cause I had it all in my
head, going to college.

22:33.710 --> 22:35.377
No one in my family's
ever been to college.

22:35.379 --> 22:36.578
I don't even think I know anybody

22:36.580 --> 22:37.612
who's ever been to college.

22:37.614 --> 22:39.347
So I was really sad, but also worried.

22:39.349 --> 22:42.284
Because I thought Ms. Adams
got in a lot of trouble,

22:42.286 --> 22:43.652
and I keep kind of thinking
it's my fault...

22:43.654 --> 22:46.788
That's a lot of words, Tyler.
Remember what I said before?

22:47.600 --> 22:48.790
Right.

22:49.477 --> 22:50.825
Just answer the question.

22:50.827 --> 22:52.093
Right.

22:52.438 --> 22:53.862
So try it again.

22:54.231 --> 22:57.432
When you found out what
she had done, were you mad?

22:57.434 --> 22:59.234
No, sir, I wasn't mad.

23:00.404 --> 23:01.803
You like Ms. Adams, don't you?

23:03.407 --> 23:05.373
I think she's a really good teacher.

23:05.375 --> 23:06.875
Nice answer.

23:06.877 --> 23:09.644
Do you think she... liked you?

23:10.664 --> 23:12.447
I think you'd have to ask her that.

23:13.283 --> 23:14.949
Good answer.

23:14.951 --> 23:18.520
Do you think the reason
why she did what she did for you

23:18.522 --> 23:19.721
and the reason you weren't mad

23:19.723 --> 23:22.290
is because the two of you
liked each other?

23:24.178 --> 23:25.593
No. Don't just stare at me.

23:25.595 --> 23:28.396
That-that looks like a yes to the jury.

23:28.398 --> 23:30.131
- But it's not.
- So,

23:30.133 --> 23:31.933
what do you say?

23:34.146 --> 23:36.805
Sir, I'm happy to answer
any questions you have

23:36.807 --> 23:38.606
about the facts of the case.

23:39.193 --> 23:40.909
But now you're just making stuff up.

23:41.278 --> 23:42.477
I don't have to answer any questions

23:42.479 --> 23:44.579
about things you make up.

23:45.866 --> 23:47.849
Nice answer.

23:47.851 --> 23:50.318
I think you're gonna do great.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.420
Tyler, when you started tenth grade,

23:52.422 --> 23:54.189
what was your letter grade average?

23:54.191 --> 23:55.757
A "C" or a "D," I think.

23:55.759 --> 23:58.526
According to your school
records, it was a C-minus.

23:59.046 --> 24:02.430
But by your senior year,
your average soared to a B-plus.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.567
Any idea what happened in
those three years to make

24:05.569 --> 24:08.470
such a dramatic difference
in your grades?

24:08.764 --> 24:11.787
Well, I think a big part of it
was Ms. Adams.

24:11.789 --> 24:13.808
She spent a lot of time tutoring me.

24:14.478 --> 24:15.577
Simple as that, huh?

24:15.579 --> 24:17.245
Just spend some time with your teacher

24:17.247 --> 24:19.314
and you get right on the honor roll.

24:19.316 --> 24:20.949
Objection. Argumentative.

24:20.951 --> 24:23.017
- Ask a question, Mr. Newhall.
- Sure.

24:23.019 --> 24:25.765
Here's a question.
How do we know the defendant

24:25.767 --> 24:27.055
wasn't changing your test scores

24:27.057 --> 24:28.990
starting <i> all</i> the way
back in the tenth grade?

24:28.992 --> 24:32.127
How do we know she hasn't been
cheating for you all along?

24:32.129 --> 24:34.129
Objection. Calls for speculation.

24:34.131 --> 24:36.331
Assumes facts not in evidence.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.999
- Sustained.
- Okay.

24:38.001 --> 24:40.535
Let me ask it another way.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.604
Are you certain your teacher

24:42.606 --> 24:44.639
hasn't been cheating for you

24:44.641 --> 24:46.039
these last three years?

24:46.041 --> 24:47.709
- Yes.
- Really?

24:47.711 --> 24:48.810
How can you be so sure?

24:48.812 --> 24:50.178
I mean, it's possible,

24:50.180 --> 24:51.413
- isn't it?
- Objection!

24:51.415 --> 24:53.515
- Anything is possible!
- Exactly!

24:53.517 --> 24:54.682
So how many tests

24:54.684 --> 24:57.085
did she <i> really</i> help you with? Ten?

24:57.087 --> 24:58.720
I don't have to
answer questions about things

24:58.722 --> 24:59.651
you make up. I don't have

24:59.676 --> 25:00.608
- 20?
- to answer questions...

25:00.610 --> 25:01.556
- ...about things you make up.
- 30?

25:01.558 --> 25:04.058
- I don't have to answer questions...
- I told you, one.

25:04.060 --> 25:06.528
One? Really?

25:06.530 --> 25:08.062
How can you be so sure?

25:08.064 --> 25:10.131
Objection! He's
badgering the witness. Please.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.433
The truth is, you can't,

25:11.435 --> 25:13.067
can you? You don't know.

25:13.069 --> 25:14.736
You have no idea.

25:14.738 --> 25:16.738
You're right.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.873
I have no idea. I don't know.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.276
I don't. I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

25:21.278 --> 25:22.410
Just stop talking. I don't.

25:22.412 --> 25:23.845
- Don't say anything.
- I don't know.

25:23.847 --> 25:24.846
Objection is sustained.

25:24.848 --> 25:26.147
I'm sorry, Bull.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.849
I really did try to prep him.

25:34.322 --> 25:36.458
That drink better be for me.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.427
Sorry, this one's spoken for.

25:39.429 --> 25:41.663
You upset about the trial?

25:41.982 --> 25:44.532
No, it's only just begun.

25:49.990 --> 25:51.806
That was a serious swallow.

25:52.660 --> 25:55.143
Want to tell your Uncle Bull
all about it?

25:57.498 --> 25:58.813
What is it about what we do

25:58.815 --> 26:01.583
- that makes it so hard to trust people?
- Oh.

26:01.585 --> 26:02.750
Hmm.

26:02.752 --> 26:04.586
We're gonna have that conversation?

26:05.547 --> 26:07.989
Marissa, give yourself a break.

26:07.991 --> 26:10.325
We spend the whole day figuring out

26:10.327 --> 26:12.293
if people are lying to us or not.

26:12.295 --> 26:14.796
And when we're not doing that,
we're figuring out

26:14.798 --> 26:16.464
how to convince 12 strangers

26:16.466 --> 26:18.978
that our clients are telling the truth.

26:19.728 --> 26:22.337
Of course we don't trust anybody.

26:24.358 --> 26:27.442
Kyle offered to do something
for me the other night.

26:27.778 --> 26:29.310
Something really nice.

26:29.312 --> 26:30.311
Really thoughtful.

26:30.313 --> 26:31.513
And what did you do?

26:32.366 --> 26:34.115
I threatened to have him arrested.

26:35.485 --> 26:37.519
Ain't love grand?

26:39.957 --> 26:42.326
I think I'm gonna go home
and call him and apologize.

26:42.328 --> 26:43.358
Oh.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.894
Well, I'm glad
I could help you work through

26:45.896 --> 26:47.495
this little crisis of the heart.

26:47.497 --> 26:50.465
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need any more ad...

26:58.201 --> 26:59.118
You're welcome.

27:00.195 --> 27:02.043
At the request
of the State Board of Education,

27:02.045 --> 27:03.745
I reviewed the tests.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.013
And what did you find?

27:05.015 --> 27:08.016
They all shared a similar
pattern of eraser marks.

27:08.018 --> 27:10.100
- How do you mean?
- The vast majority

27:10.102 --> 27:14.355
were in the history section,
between questions 20 and 35.

27:14.658 --> 27:17.225
This is a copy of Tyler Young's test.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.993
There are three erasure marks,

27:18.995 --> 27:21.829
one of which Ms. Adams admits to making.

27:21.831 --> 27:24.666
They are all wrong
to right answer changes.

27:24.668 --> 27:26.167
What number questions are those?

27:26.169 --> 27:29.504
11, 48, and 73.

27:29.506 --> 27:30.872
None are in the history section.

27:30.874 --> 27:31.991
- Correct.
- And none are

27:31.993 --> 27:33.207
in the question 20

27:33.209 --> 27:34.842
to question 35 range.

27:34.844 --> 27:35.810
Correct.

27:35.812 --> 27:37.045
Sounds like Tyler's test

27:37.047 --> 27:38.580
is very different from the others.

27:38.582 --> 27:40.348
Objection. Leading.

27:40.350 --> 27:41.482
Sustained.

27:41.484 --> 27:42.684
I'll put it another way.

27:42.686 --> 27:45.420
The test Lacey admits to changing

27:45.422 --> 27:48.256
is different
from all the other 800 tests.

27:48.258 --> 27:50.658
It doesn't fit the pattern, right?

27:50.660 --> 27:51.593
Right.

27:52.529 --> 27:54.228
Nothing further.

27:55.165 --> 27:57.098
Talk to me, Marissa. Well, yesterday was

27:57.100 --> 27:58.967
a train wreck. No green
on the screens anywhere.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.969
But today we have seven greens back,

28:00.971 --> 28:02.637
three yellows, and two reds.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.439
So even though the two of you
hate each other,

28:04.441 --> 28:06.941
it seems like you're making progress.

28:08.253 --> 28:09.210
Hmm.

28:09.671 --> 28:10.878
Hey, can I talk to you?

28:10.880 --> 28:13.281
Talk fast. I got a car waiting.
What are you offering?

28:13.283 --> 28:15.016
What makes you think
I'm offering anything?

28:15.511 --> 28:17.652
'Cause it's my job to know
whether I'm winning or losing

28:17.654 --> 28:18.753
and by how much.

28:18.755 --> 28:20.888
And right now, I'm winning. By a lot.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.287
I'll drop the charges against Lacey.

28:23.289 --> 28:25.415
I'll even make sure she gets
her teaching credentials back.

28:25.417 --> 28:26.828
And my boss will call
the dean of students

28:26.830 --> 28:28.396
at Tyler's college, get him reinstated.

28:28.398 --> 28:30.365
In exchange for...?

28:30.859 --> 28:32.533
I need those five other teachers.

28:33.070 --> 28:35.970
I get it. Your client's
a nice lady who did

28:35.972 --> 28:37.605
a bad thing for a good reason.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.140
But those other five...

28:39.142 --> 28:42.610
Come on. You're asking her
to decide between her colleagues

28:42.612 --> 28:44.812
- and her student.
- Her student

28:44.814 --> 28:46.080
and her career.

28:46.082 --> 28:49.350
Tyler can quit his dead-end job
and go to college.

28:49.795 --> 28:52.453
And Lacey can get back in the classroom.

29:09.553 --> 29:10.886
Wow.

29:10.888 --> 29:15.757
So, is, um, this why
you wanted me here early?

29:16.147 --> 29:18.114
So you could triple-team me?

29:18.116 --> 29:19.382
It's a good deal,

29:19.384 --> 29:20.716
Lacey.

29:20.718 --> 29:23.052
I'd go so far as to say
it's a great deal.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.520
And I am not in the business

29:24.522 --> 29:26.722
of throwing other teachers to the wolves.

29:26.724 --> 29:29.759
But I will be here for them,
just as I was for you.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.728
It sounds like you've
already made up your mind.

29:32.730 --> 29:35.164
You heard what I thought
when I called you last night.

29:35.166 --> 29:36.866
Gets you everything you want.

29:36.868 --> 29:39.635
Tyler gets to go to college.
You get to continue teaching.

29:39.637 --> 29:41.637
And as for the other teachers,

29:41.639 --> 29:43.773
they get their day in
court, just like you did.

29:43.775 --> 29:45.474
My two cents... I worked

29:45.476 --> 29:47.476
in the DA's office a long time.

29:47.478 --> 29:49.812
Deals don't get much better than this.

29:51.683 --> 29:53.233
So it's unanimous.

29:53.651 --> 29:55.770
You want me to sell out
the people I work with.

29:55.772 --> 29:57.586
I wouldn't call it a sellout.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.955
The ADA already knows who they are.

29:59.957 --> 30:01.891
He already knows what they did.

30:01.893 --> 30:03.257
But he can't prove it without me.

30:03.259 --> 30:04.527
Today.

30:04.529 --> 30:06.295
But maybe tomorrow he can.

30:06.297 --> 30:09.065
And maybe tomorrow,
one of the five goes to him

30:09.067 --> 30:10.299
and cuts a deal.

30:10.301 --> 30:13.302
And then you have nothing.

30:13.304 --> 30:15.371
Nothing but jail time.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.740
It's your decision, Lacey.

30:17.742 --> 30:19.575
We just want you to
understand what's at stake.

30:19.577 --> 30:22.712
But whatever you decide,
we'll go along with it.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.784
I want Tyler to go back to school.

30:28.786 --> 30:32.655
And... I want to keep my job.

30:34.192 --> 30:36.258
But I couldn't live with myself knowing

30:36.260 --> 30:38.820
I destroyed the lives of others
to make it happen.

30:40.631 --> 30:42.164
You called it.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.117
How did you describe her?

30:44.535 --> 30:47.269
- The architect of her own destiny.
- Mm.

30:49.413 --> 30:51.380
We are all here for you, Lacey.

30:51.576 --> 30:54.506
Now, I will call the ADA's office,

30:54.508 --> 30:56.612
let 'em know that you
have made your decision,

30:56.614 --> 30:59.915
and... we can plot our next move.

30:59.917 --> 31:01.385
You know what,

31:01.853 --> 31:04.387
I just plotted my next move.

31:04.389 --> 31:06.856
I'm withdrawing from the case.

31:07.599 --> 31:08.893
Wait, you're what?

31:08.895 --> 31:12.328
Our union is happy to come
to the aid of our members

31:12.330 --> 31:15.064
when they've been
wrongly accused of a crime.

31:15.066 --> 31:18.401
We're even happy to help when
they've admitted to a crime,

31:18.403 --> 31:21.237
when we think there are
extenuating circumstances

31:21.239 --> 31:24.240
that will impact the lives
of working teachers.

31:24.242 --> 31:26.108
But I am not about

31:26.110 --> 31:28.778
to spend our very limited time
and resources

31:28.780 --> 31:31.999
on what I now realize
is a suicide mission.

31:32.884 --> 31:35.684
I'm sure Dr. Bull
can help you find someone

31:35.686 --> 31:38.255
to get you through the remainder
of the trial.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.387
I did not see that coming.

31:46.597 --> 31:48.531
Did I just make a huge mistake?

31:48.533 --> 31:51.100
I actually think you traded up.

31:52.403 --> 31:54.570
Oh. Yeah.

31:54.572 --> 31:57.106
I bet you say that to all
the second-string lawyers.

31:58.643 --> 32:00.943
What's the game plan, Doc?

32:00.945 --> 32:03.679
Well, we have a little less than an hour

32:03.681 --> 32:06.081
to get young Ms. Adams ready.

32:06.083 --> 32:08.017
For what?

32:08.019 --> 32:09.786
We're putting you on the stand.

32:13.825 --> 32:16.659
Lacey, you already testified

32:16.661 --> 32:20.095
that the second you saw Tyler
the morning of the exam

32:20.422 --> 32:22.264
you knew that he was going to struggle.

32:22.266 --> 32:23.732
What was that based on?

32:23.734 --> 32:26.635
Well, to begin with,
he was already a half hour late.

32:26.637 --> 32:30.318
But more than that, I know
how complicated his life is.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.318
How do you mean?

32:31.320 --> 32:32.641
Well, first of all,

32:32.643 --> 32:34.410
he's got a little brother
he's got to feed

32:34.412 --> 32:36.229
and get off to school every morning.

32:37.014 --> 32:41.250
Plus, his mother, um, has a drug problem,

32:41.252 --> 32:44.253
and sometimes she brings men
to the apartment

32:44.255 --> 32:47.790
in the middle of the night
to, uh, support her drug habit.

32:47.792 --> 32:51.495
On these nights, I-I know
Tyler doesn't get any sleep.

32:52.163 --> 32:55.328
I'm fairly certain that's what
happened the day of the test.

32:55.330 --> 32:57.633
Objection. Hearsay.

32:57.635 --> 32:58.634
Right on cue.

32:58.636 --> 33:00.402
It's not hearsay.

33:00.404 --> 33:02.638
During school vacations,
I would go to his apartment

33:02.640 --> 33:05.741
and tutor him in the morning
and then again in the evening.

33:05.743 --> 33:07.910
I know what I'm talking about.

33:07.912 --> 33:09.002
I'm going to allow it.

33:09.004 --> 33:10.346
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:10.847 --> 33:12.643
So let me ask you a question.

33:15.686 --> 33:17.120
Was this your plan?

33:17.955 --> 33:19.588
Tyler takes the test.

33:19.590 --> 33:21.023
If he doesn't make the grade,

33:21.025 --> 33:23.325
you figure out a way
to doctor his answers?

33:23.327 --> 33:26.279
No. It didn't even cross my mind.

33:26.764 --> 33:28.721
Tyler is a solid "B" student.

33:28.723 --> 33:31.560
But that morning, you knew
he wasn't getting a "B."

33:31.562 --> 33:32.828
I didn't know...

33:33.804 --> 33:35.938
but-but I sensed.

33:35.940 --> 33:39.167
I just wanted to look at it, the test.

33:39.577 --> 33:41.110
That's all I really wanted to do,

33:41.112 --> 33:43.946
is just put my mind at ease
that he had passed,

33:43.948 --> 33:45.814
and that he'd be going to college.

33:46.049 --> 33:47.182
But then I walked in,

33:47.184 --> 33:49.666
and I realized that all I had
to do was change one question,

33:49.668 --> 33:51.548
and he could have a future.

33:51.550 --> 33:53.556
You and Tyler prepped for the exam,

33:53.558 --> 33:54.757
is that correct?

33:55.142 --> 33:56.926
You gave him practice tests?

33:56.928 --> 33:58.327
Yes, three times.

33:58.329 --> 33:59.421
And how did he do?

33:59.423 --> 34:02.141
80s. Low 80s, every time.

34:02.143 --> 34:04.466
That's how I know him failing
is an anomaly.

34:04.468 --> 34:05.788
One last question.

34:05.790 --> 34:08.637
If you could do anything
you wanted to in life...

34:08.639 --> 34:12.641
okay, a-a-anything at all,
money's no object...

34:12.643 --> 34:14.076
what would that be?

34:14.078 --> 34:15.710
Objection. Relevance.

34:15.713 --> 34:17.121
Overruled.

34:21.272 --> 34:22.418
This.

34:23.007 --> 34:26.339
Uh, teaching, not testifying.

34:27.110 --> 34:30.078
Showing people who think they
know where their boundaries are

34:30.080 --> 34:33.638
that there's so much more.

34:35.223 --> 34:38.219
No further questions, Your Honor.

34:41.125 --> 34:42.491
Cross-examination.

34:43.190 --> 34:44.733
One question.

34:45.663 --> 34:48.664
Did you or did you not change an answer

34:48.666 --> 34:50.431
on Tyler Young's exam?

34:50.434 --> 34:51.900
Objection.

34:51.902 --> 34:53.735
Asked and answered, Your Honor.

34:54.074 --> 34:55.404
Overruled.

34:55.406 --> 34:57.537
Yes or no? I need to hear.

34:57.970 --> 35:00.609
Did you alter, in any way,
Tyler Young's exam

35:00.611 --> 35:02.544
after it was completed?

35:02.546 --> 35:06.248
Making you guilty of tampering
with a government record.

35:07.751 --> 35:09.341
As well as perjury,

35:10.258 --> 35:13.255
since you warranted the results
by virtue of your role

35:13.257 --> 35:15.290
as the official proctor of record.

35:16.994 --> 35:18.475
And fraud...

35:19.196 --> 35:21.797
since your intent was to deceive.

35:24.814 --> 35:26.368
Yes or no.

35:27.738 --> 35:29.027
Yes.

35:29.940 --> 35:31.240
Uh, yes, I did.

35:32.405 --> 35:34.243
No more questions.

35:47.438 --> 35:50.163
Okay. How we doing
with closing arguments?

35:50.251 --> 35:52.121
- Uh...
- Not good.

35:52.123 --> 35:54.253
We've already run six different versions.

35:54.255 --> 35:56.355
Yeah, I just let the
last group of mock jurors go.

35:56.357 --> 35:58.324
We were just throwing away
good money after bad.

35:58.326 --> 36:00.276
I don't understand. What's the problem?

36:00.276 --> 36:02.142
The problem is she did it, Bull.

36:02.144 --> 36:03.544
That's always been a problem.

36:03.546 --> 36:05.813
They're just not buying
the necessity defense.

36:05.815 --> 36:07.881
They want more evidence
to support Lacey's choice.

36:07.883 --> 36:10.117
If you want to win an acquittal,

36:10.119 --> 36:11.361
we need something tangible,

36:11.987 --> 36:14.755
something definitive,
something objective.

36:15.699 --> 36:17.357
Then that's what we'll give them.

36:17.359 --> 36:19.693
You want the boy to take the test again?

36:19.695 --> 36:21.406
Here? Today?

36:21.408 --> 36:22.996
I have the testing service standing by

36:22.998 --> 36:24.431
with a fresh version of the exam.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.166
And I am happy to have Your Honor,

36:26.168 --> 36:28.569
and the ADA here, proctor it,

36:28.571 --> 36:30.237
so everyone can be sure

36:30.239 --> 36:31.805
that there's no funny business going on.

36:31.807 --> 36:33.407
Give him the test and two hours later,

36:33.409 --> 36:34.742
we will know where we stand.

36:34.744 --> 36:35.769
Your Honor,

36:35.771 --> 36:38.212
this is completely irrelevant
and unduly prejudicial,

36:38.214 --> 36:39.713
not to mention an obfuscation.

36:39.715 --> 36:42.316
Judge Conway, I disagree.

36:42.318 --> 36:44.952
Our client has never denied what she did.

36:44.954 --> 36:47.654
What's relevant here is why she did it.

36:50.294 --> 36:53.160
It's unorthodox,
but I agree it's relevant.

36:53.162 --> 36:54.862
And I'm going to allow it.

37:35.028 --> 37:37.437
In the 82nd percentile,

37:37.439 --> 37:38.782
ladies and gentlemen.

37:39.708 --> 37:41.975
That's what Tyler Young scored

37:41.977 --> 37:44.378
when he retook his
college placement exam.

37:44.746 --> 37:46.414
82%.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.186
Now, why does that matter?

37:48.188 --> 37:50.484
Well, because it proves why Lacey felt

37:50.486 --> 37:52.152
what she did was necessary.

37:52.154 --> 37:54.188
Against the rules,

37:54.190 --> 37:55.382
but necessary.

37:56.659 --> 38:00.060
She knew what her student was capable of,

38:00.062 --> 38:02.963
and didn't want that student's
future compromised

38:02.965 --> 38:05.642
because of circumstances
that were beyond his control.

38:07.102 --> 38:09.503
Lacey Adams confessed

38:09.505 --> 38:12.816
to changing a single answer,

38:13.409 --> 38:17.578
bringing Tyler's test
to the 65th percentile,

38:17.580 --> 38:21.048
allowing him to attend a local college,

38:21.050 --> 38:24.160
where he hoped to study architecture,

38:24.420 --> 38:27.154
and perhaps be the first person
in his family

38:27.156 --> 38:29.122
to earn a college degree.

38:29.290 --> 38:31.458
Is changing answers wrong?

38:31.460 --> 38:34.129
Yes, absolutely.

38:34.663 --> 38:37.006
But is it, is it worse than...

38:37.799 --> 38:41.635
taking away a bright young man's
opportunity to better himself,

38:41.970 --> 38:43.555
change his future?

38:44.597 --> 38:46.975
Well, I guess that's why you're here.

38:47.676 --> 38:51.945
I guess that's why we'll leave
it up to you to decide.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.481
Thank you for listening.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.781
Madam Foreman,
have you reached a verdict?

39:02.057 --> 39:03.825
Yes we have, Your Honor.

39:04.993 --> 39:06.994
We, the jury,

39:06.996 --> 39:10.597
find the defendant, Lacey Adams, guilty

39:10.599 --> 39:14.201
on one count of tampering
with a government record,

39:14.203 --> 39:16.342
one count of perjury,

39:16.344 --> 39:18.705
and one count of fraud.

39:20.542 --> 39:22.542
I'm sorry. I'm, uh...

39:22.544 --> 39:24.444
No. I did it.

39:24.804 --> 39:26.179
I did.

39:26.181 --> 39:27.481
Bull?

39:27.724 --> 39:29.267
Is she okay?

39:29.652 --> 39:31.019
Are-are you okay?

39:32.270 --> 39:35.455
I am so, so sorry.

39:35.457 --> 39:38.091
I'll fix this, I will.

39:38.093 --> 39:41.321
Somehow, I promise.

39:47.535 --> 39:49.245
Okay.

39:55.168 --> 39:56.795
You're here.

39:57.146 --> 39:59.012
You actually showed up.

39:59.014 --> 40:01.882
Hey. You're not the mayor.

40:04.153 --> 40:06.620
She sends her regrets.

40:06.622 --> 40:08.622
She really wanted to be here tonight.

40:09.801 --> 40:11.525
No, she didn't.

40:11.527 --> 40:13.160
I was surprised when you
called to schedule it.

40:13.162 --> 40:16.648
I mean, most people
just give the money and...

40:17.199 --> 40:19.466
let the carriage ride go.

40:19.468 --> 40:22.235
Well, the truth is, I need a favor.

40:22.237 --> 40:24.838
And I was hoping I could
ask the mayor directly.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.107
Happy to carry your water, Dr. Bull.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.709
You remember the case you asked

40:28.711 --> 40:30.610
for my help on about a month ago?

40:30.612 --> 40:31.955
I do.

40:32.648 --> 40:33.915
We lost.

40:34.483 --> 40:37.050
I'm aware, but... it all worked out.

40:37.052 --> 40:39.353
The judge liked her;
gave her no jail time.

40:39.355 --> 40:40.797
Not the worst ending.

40:41.590 --> 40:44.157
But she's got a felony on her record,

40:44.159 --> 40:47.828
and, uh, now she can't teach.

40:47.830 --> 40:50.697
I just...

40:50.699 --> 40:52.532
I think we lost one of the good ones,

40:52.534 --> 40:55.702
maybe even one of the great ones.

40:55.704 --> 40:58.773
Thing about teaching is,
if you're meant to do it,

40:59.899 --> 41:01.375
you're gonna do it.

41:01.377 --> 41:02.876
Maybe not in a classroom.

41:02.878 --> 41:05.154
Maybe not in the
State of New York, but...

41:06.242 --> 41:08.843
I just have a feeling
she's gonna be fine.

41:08.868 --> 41:12.269
Probably end up in
a private school somewhere.

41:12.579 --> 41:14.521
Massachusetts, maybe.

41:14.523 --> 41:16.666
You seem to know an awful lot about her.

41:17.659 --> 41:19.960
I'll let you in on a little secret.

41:19.962 --> 41:21.962
The reason I sought you out that night?

41:21.964 --> 41:24.197
Her father is a bigwig in the party.

41:24.199 --> 41:26.400
Major contributor,
especially in New England.

41:26.402 --> 41:29.403
He knew his daughter would never
accept any help from him,

41:29.405 --> 41:32.272
so he asked our office to intervene.

41:32.274 --> 41:34.107
He called the mayor himself.

41:36.979 --> 41:38.879
In any event,

41:38.881 --> 41:40.514
your client's gonna be fine.

41:40.516 --> 41:42.249
Was that your favor?

41:43.919 --> 41:45.452
What is it about what we do

41:45.454 --> 41:47.822
that makes it so hard to trust people?

41:48.791 --> 41:50.090
Excuse me?

41:50.092 --> 41:51.792
Agree or disagree:

41:51.794 --> 41:55.695
Honesty is the best policy in all cases.

41:55.697 --> 41:58.333
I don't think I understand.

41:58.934 --> 42:00.967
I'm sure you don't.

42:02.805 --> 42:05.472
I need the mayor, or someone
from the mayor's office,

42:05.474 --> 42:08.308
to get on the phone and find a place

42:08.310 --> 42:11.711
for Tyler Young to go to a city college.

42:12.221 --> 42:14.981
That would be highly irregular

42:14.983 --> 42:17.517
for the mayor to use her influence

42:17.519 --> 42:21.455
to gain admission for any individual...

42:21.457 --> 42:23.590
It could even be construed as unethical.

42:23.592 --> 42:25.759
Like the way the mayor twisted my arm

42:25.761 --> 42:28.295
to get me to work for free
so she could curry favor

42:28.297 --> 42:30.156
with a party bigwig?

42:31.074 --> 42:32.999
You ever heard of Machiavelli?

42:33.001 --> 42:35.745
Very successful politician.

42:36.238 --> 42:39.940
I think he and the mayor would
have gotten along really well.

42:41.043 --> 42:44.744
Get the Tyler Young
college thing done for me.

42:47.349 --> 42:49.342
Shouldn't be a problem.

42:49.885 --> 42:51.135
Great.

42:52.387 --> 42:54.754
Driver, I'm gonna hop off.

42:54.756 --> 42:56.890
I got what I came for.

42:56.892 --> 42:58.643
Thanks for the ride.
