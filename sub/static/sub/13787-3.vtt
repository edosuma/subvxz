They're under
my protection now.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.006
You're a liar.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.047
And I won't kill for you.

32:16.727 --> 32:17.842
Not anymore.

Fuck you. bitch.

crossed their own oceans.

REIMLU: What about
when the rest of the
fleet arrives?

32:56.892 --> 32:58.382
Three thousand
years from now.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.261
Kaziri was launched
ahead of the Arks

33:03.357 --> 33:05.222
to terraform
a barren world.

33:06.276 --> 33:07.982
This is not
a barren world.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.401
How are we supposed
to live there

33:10.739 --> 33:12.229
amongst aliens?

33:15.285 --> 33:16.741
Or have you forgotten?

33:21.541 --> 33:23.247
It's time we
seize the ship.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.683
IRZU: I'm sorry
this hurts so much.

33:41.770 --> 33:44.011
But you brought
it on yourself.

[W]

33:49.486 --> 33:51.317
I'll wait with you.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.910
Would you like me
to sing to you?

34:02.124 --> 34:04.115
It'll help the
time go by.

34:07.796 --> 34:10.458
How about the song
that Nolan taught you.

34:15.303 --> 34:19.717

upon the ark

Kama Lea, Kama Lea

34:42.330 --> 34:45.993
Maid with ivory hair

34:46.835 --> 34:51.169
Starlight came along with thee

34:59.347 --> 35:01.929
I brought you some tea
for the withdrawal symptoms.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.346
With the adreno
pipeline shut down.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.720

the Hollows have been very

Only a fool would
underestimate your
resourcefulness.

here at the NeedWant.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.957
Nonetheless.
you are impressive.

35:39.012 --> 35:41.924
It's weird having Nolan back.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.931
It reminds me
of the old days.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.482
I miss her too.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.685
Do you think she's
ever coming back?

36:03.787 --> 36:05.527
(SPEAKING CASTITHAN)

36:07.332 --> 36:08.617
All my heart.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.837
Me. too.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.526
Are you okay?

37:24.326 --> 37:26.112
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

37:33.627 --> 37:35.037
Where have you been?

37:35.128 --> 37:36.914
One minute I was
in the market. And the next

37:37.005 --> 37:39.121
I was waking up in the woods.
lrisa found me.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.671
You found her?
Uh-huh.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.582
What were you
doing in the woods?
I was looking for Bertie.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.292
You had Liberata
blood on your cuffs. Why?

37:44.387 --> 37:46.127
BERTIE: I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.723
You're lying.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.257
And so are you.
You did something to her.

37:50.352 --> 37:53.014
And you're covering up.
All right. back off. Nolan.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.015
I just want to go home.
