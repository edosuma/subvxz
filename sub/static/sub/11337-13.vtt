WEBVTT

00:08.409 --> 00:10.042
Helen. Helen?

00:10.044 --> 00:12.244
Talk to me,
just talk to me.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.346
Mr. Mitchell, I think
she's had enough for one day.
For God's sake, Helen,

00:14.348 --> 00:15.614
it doesn't have
to be this way.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.399
You're the one
who made it this way.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.183
I am? None of this had
to happen, it was you that...

00:19.186 --> 00:20.586
You're the one
who lied in there.
I didn't lie.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.788
I just-- I'm trying to do
what's best for my kids.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.390
For<i> your</i> kids?

00:24.392 --> 00:25.457
Mr. Mitchell,
the case is closed.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.692
Custody is settled, there's...

00:26.694 --> 00:27.793
Just get out of my way.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.261
Haven't you done enough damage?

00:29.263 --> 00:30.696
Me? What about her?
It's over, all right?

00:30.698 --> 00:32.531
It's over.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.702
I was just going to say I wish
we would've both done better.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.111
You've got some
papers to sign.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.459
Hey.
Morning.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.428
Morning.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.498
Wow, nice scar.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.333
Thanks.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.269
Professional or recreational?

01:10.271 --> 01:12.504
A little of both.
Oh, yeah?

01:12.506 --> 01:14.239
Yeah.
What happened?

01:14.241 --> 01:16.408
There was an apartment
fire in High Park.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.511
Old building, so the thing
went up in about five minutes.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.413
People were jumping

01:21.415 --> 01:23.449
from their balconies.
It was a mess.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.617
So I was bringing this kid down
from the third floor,

01:25.619 --> 01:26.718
and that's when
the stairs collapsed.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.487
Barely made it out myself.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.421
The kid make it?

01:29.423 --> 01:32.357
Nope.
Sorry.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.593
What was the recreational part?

01:34.595 --> 01:37.362
I got so pissed off that night,

01:37.364 --> 01:39.498
threw back a few shots,
jumped on my bike...

01:39.500 --> 01:41.700
Harley didn't make it, I did.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.371
You know, there's good plastic
surgeons if you ever want

01:46.373 --> 01:48.173
to get rid of that.
WINNIE (over P.A.):
Team One,

01:48.175 --> 01:49.374
suit up, suit up!

01:49.376 --> 01:50.542
Gun call, Business District,

01:50.544 --> 01:52.544
2002 Bay Street.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.514
Nah, it's a good reminder
not to be an idiot.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.350
I got four brothers for that.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.418
(chuckles)

01:59.420 --> 02:01.553
(panicked shouting)

02:04.325 --> 02:05.424
This is a mistake, please.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.693
You're not listening to me!

02:07.695 --> 02:10.395
There's nothing I could do,
I swear to God!

02:11.565 --> 02:15.634
I'm going to give you
one last chance.

02:16.871 --> 02:18.704
(sirens wailing)

02:25.379 --> 02:27.446
Got it all, thanks.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.619
Hey.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.587
White male, late 30s,

02:35.589 --> 02:38.157
pulls a gun, forces another
white male into the building.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.159
They get a location inside?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.561
They were seen in the atrium,
but beyond that, no idea.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.530
Shots fired?
Not yet.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.465
Uniforms cleared
the first two floors,

02:46.467 --> 02:48.167
but they don't have shields,
so they backed off

02:48.169 --> 02:49.334
in case the guy went active.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.303
All right, let's see
what Spike's got.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.639
Let's get talking, before buddy
takes it up a level.

02:53.641 --> 02:54.907
Priorities on "who" and "where."

02:54.909 --> 02:56.475
Bonus points for "why"?

02:56.477 --> 02:58.277
(Parker laughs)

02:58.279 --> 03:00.279
Okay, guys,
we've got 12 floors,

03:00.281 --> 03:02.548
a dozen offices per floor.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.616
Sam?
That's a lot of window.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.218
360-degree exposure.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.253
Can't pick a sniper perch
without more intel.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.555
Let's narrow it down.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.223
Okay, I got the building's
head of security.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.791
He says his guys
on these floors

03:12.793 --> 03:14.526
have reported no disturbances,
and he's awaiting

03:14.528 --> 03:16.628
instructions.
Okay, tell him to lock down
the elevators,

03:16.630 --> 03:19.798
First priority is to immobilize
and contain the threat.
Copy that.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.300
He came up this way

03:21.302 --> 03:22.968
He starts yelling
at the other guy who was

03:22.970 --> 03:24.670
just coming out.
Then he pulls a gun

03:24.672 --> 03:26.738
and makes the other guy turn
around and go back inside.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.208
Do you know
either of the men?
Well, I've seen the guy

03:29.210 --> 03:30.609
he was pointing
the gun at, the lawyer.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.444
He's a lawyer?
Pretty sure

03:32.446 --> 03:34.379
he hangs out with the other
lawyers from he building.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.615
What was he yelling?

03:36.617 --> 03:37.816
Something about his kids.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.568
Somebody took his kids.

03:39.569 --> 03:41.319
Okay, and you say it seemed like
they knew each other?

03:42.356 --> 03:43.589
Do you know where
his office is?

03:43.591 --> 03:44.774
Well, it's not
on the first floor.

03:44.775 --> 03:45.958
I got my office there.
I know everybody.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.793
Above that, really don't
have a clue, man. Sorry.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.561
Any idea what
kind of weapon it was?

03:49.563 --> 03:52.264
A handgun, shotgun, rifle...?
A handgun.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.732
I just saw a flash of silver.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.567
I'm sorry,
I don't know guns.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.603
No, no, that's good,
that helps.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.737
Do you know the victim?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.673
I don't know his name,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.608
but, yeah, I think he has
an office in the building.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.543
Any idea which office?

04:07.381 --> 04:08.747
PARKER (over headset):
Eddie?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.249
Hostage may be a lawyer.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.617
ED (over headset):
Okay, copy that, boss.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.619
Spike, you got a tenant list?

04:13.621 --> 04:15.621
Lawyers, we got plenty
of lawyers.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.022
Law firms
from here to here,

04:17.024 --> 04:19.625
and here and here.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.527
JULES (over headset):
Hey, guys, my witness says
they seem to know each other.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.629
This is personal.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.464
Something about losing his kids.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.665
So he's stressed.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.484
He just suffered a loss.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.302
How stressed do you have to be
to come after a lawyer?

04:30.304 --> 04:33.605
So what, the guy grabs a lawyer,
takes him to his own office?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.474
Or he grabs the guy and
takes him to the most
convenient office.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.377
All right, until we learn more,
we do it the hard way.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.445
We start at the tenth floor.
We work our way down.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.584
Stealth entry.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.628
Locate and evacuate
any citizens at risk.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.734
SRU, come with me.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.773
Clearing two friends.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.508
10-4, clear.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.444
ED (over headset):
Find the subject and the hostage

05:12.446 --> 05:14.313
without alerting them
to our presence.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.649
Clear.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.054
Ninth floor,
suites 901 to 910, clear.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.523
Got it.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.129
DONALD:
Where are my kids?!

05:30.130 --> 05:31.463
Donald, you need to calm down.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.999
Don't you patronize me,
you son of a bitch.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.567
I will not lose them.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.369
I haven't come this far.
I haven't worked this hard

05:37.371 --> 05:38.537
just to walk away.
(groans)

05:38.539 --> 05:39.738
Now start talking!

05:39.740 --> 05:40.939
This guy sees this other guy,

05:40.941 --> 05:42.691
like he's waiting for him.

05:42.692 --> 05:44.442
Then he gets out of his car,
he almost knocks me down.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.011
Which car?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.679
Um, that one right there.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.848
Okay.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.889
Seventh floor, clear.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.863
Where are you, buddy?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.366
Sixth floor,
suites 601 to 610, clear.

06:07.368 --> 06:08.800
Got it.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.982
(men arguing in distance)

06:23.984 --> 06:25.851
(whispers):
Subjects located.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.753
Two males arguing.

06:27.755 --> 06:31.590
Office of "Adam Westfall,"
room 612.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.759
Door facing the atrium,
southwest.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.428
SPIKE (over headset):
Adam Westfall. I'll track

06:36.430 --> 06:38.663
recent cases, see what might
have triggered this.

06:38.665 --> 06:39.898
Let's keep them contained.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.801
SPIKE (over headset):
Adam Westfall.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.737
Specializes in family law,
small office,

06:45.739 --> 06:48.173
one employee--
Amanda Martin, paralegal.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.708
She could be
in the office as well.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.942
She might be at risk.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.861
Wordy, get eyes in.

06:52.862 --> 06:54.779
We may have a second citizen
in there, a possible hostage,

06:54.782 --> 06:56.548
maybe somebody injured
or hiding.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.716
WORDY (over headset):
Copy that.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.253
You know exactly

07:01.254 --> 07:02.821
what's going on.
Now that she's got them,

07:02.823 --> 07:05.657
she takes them back to Ireland,
her parents

07:05.659 --> 07:07.592
help her out and I
never see them again.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.828
Well, that is not
going to happen!

07:09.830 --> 07:11.830
(whispers):
The subject's telling him,
now that she's got the kids,

07:11.832 --> 07:13.498
"she's taking them back
to Ireland to her parents,

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
he'll never see them again."

07:15.502 --> 07:17.836
Check with the uniforms.
Amanda Martin's car

07:17.838 --> 07:19.137
is in her space in the garage.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.605
A couple people saw her
at work today.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.140
Chances are she's inside.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.542
She's a wild card.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.044
I don't like wild cards.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.545
Maybe we get lucky,
and she's outside the building.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.913
Boss, there's no way we can

07:27.915 --> 07:29.815
go in till we've located her.

07:29.817 --> 07:33.585
Hey, Spike, the subject's car is
registered to a Donald Mitchell.

07:33.587 --> 07:37.456
Donald Mitchell, cross-ref
with Adam Westfall and-- oh,

07:37.458 --> 07:39.524
I get to say "bingo"?
Please don't say "bingo."

07:39.526 --> 07:42.694
Westfall was in court
this morning representing

07:42.696 --> 07:44.563
Helen Mitchell
in a custody case.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.164
He loses custody,
blames her lawyer.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.999
Okay, see what you can
find out about the case.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.101
Get an address for the wife
and send it to Jules.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.137
Jules?
On my way.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.474
Snake cam's good to go.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.908
Let's figure out
where to put it.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.460
Spike, we need the schematic

07:58.461 --> 08:00.011
for Westfall's office.
Coming at you.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.250
Two rooms.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.651
My guess,
she's in the closet.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.487
If she's hiding
or even in there.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.121
Well, we got uniforms

08:10.123 --> 08:11.223
checking the crowd for her.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.191
You know,
nobody's found her yet.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.593
Can we get a cam
into that closet?

08:14.595 --> 08:15.961
WORDY (over headset):
If we go in through

08:15.963 --> 08:17.963
the outside wall. It's concrete.
Might take a while.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.731
Fast is good.
Get eyes

08:19.733 --> 08:21.967
into the main office,
then we'll focus on the closet.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.034
Copy that.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.903
Okay, quick and quiet.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.505
Guys, as far as I can tell,

08:26.507 --> 08:28.257
Mitchell's a pretty
solid citizen.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.008
No arrests,
not even a speeding ticket.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.376
What about the custody case?

08:31.377 --> 08:32.743
Well, according to the clerk
in family law,

08:32.746 --> 08:33.912
it was "a real nasty one."

08:33.914 --> 08:35.680
And Donald lost the kids.
No.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.616
He won.
He got full custody.

08:37.618 --> 08:38.750
Say it again?

08:38.752 --> 08:40.652
He got custody?
Yeah.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.207
His wife's stealing the kids.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.258
So this isn't about
revenge on the lawyer.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.993
This is about
a parental abduction.

08:50.197 --> 08:54.032
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

09:27.968 --> 09:31.236
2:14 p.m.,
armed-hostage-taking, motivated

09:31.238 --> 09:33.004
by possible parental abduction.

09:33.006 --> 09:36.007
So Mitchell gets
full custody of the kids,

09:36.009 --> 09:37.242
then goes after
the wife's lawyer?

09:37.244 --> 09:39.061
I don't get it.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.879
His means are extreme,
but his purpose is rational.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.948
PARKER:
I think it's time to go verbal.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.983
You got his cell number?
Yeah.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.685
Call her. Call Helen.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.987
ADAM:
No, I'm not leading
her into a trap.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.056
Do it! Make the call.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.192
(speed dialing tone)

09:54.194 --> 09:55.944
Speed dial.

09:55.945 --> 09:57.695
Yeah, I knew
you two were close.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.164
She's a client.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.599
I know what she's like.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.134
Went straight to voice mail.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.369
Have her call you.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.706
(cell phone ringing)

10:07.708 --> 10:09.040
Yeah.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.241
PARKER (on phone):
Donald Mitchell?

10:10.243 --> 10:11.610
Yes.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.011
My name is
Sergeant Gregory Parker.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.313
I'm with the Police,
Strategic Response Unit.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.681
Police, right.

10:16.683 --> 10:17.782
How are you?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.718
Doing okay.
How are you doing?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.086
I'm fine, just fine.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.320
Just taking care of something,
since you guys couldn't

10:22.322 --> 10:24.022
help me out;
it's a little time-sensitive,

10:24.024 --> 10:25.824
so maybe I can get back to you.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.625
Yeah, it sounds like you're
under a little pressure here.

10:27.628 --> 10:31.096
Yeah. My wife stole my kids.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.497
I called the school to tell them

10:32.498 --> 10:33.897
I'm going to pick them up early,
they were gone.

10:33.900 --> 10:34.899
They weren't at her place,

10:34.901 --> 10:36.868
they're just gone.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.037
Okay, well,
maybe there's a reason.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.306
She stole my kids and this
son of a bitch helped her out.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.774
He tells me

10:42.776 --> 10:44.676
where they are,
and this is over.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.277
Let me help you, Donald.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.712
I already called the police
and they blew me off.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.114
The guy says,
yeah, you know, whatever.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.682
Why don't you just come down,
fill in some forms...

10:50.684 --> 10:51.850
Donald, I'm sorry
that they didn't

10:51.852 --> 10:53.118
listen to you,
but I can assure you...

10:53.120 --> 10:55.286
She's on the way
to the border as we speak.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.604
She's taking them away.

10:56.605 --> 10:57.921
It's too late
for "proper channels."

10:57.924 --> 10:59.224
Donald, I'm here to help you.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.159
I need answers now
and I'm handling this.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.729
Let's get a photo of Helen
Mitchell, put it out there.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.431
See if we can't track her down.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.066
Okay, let's find
out where his kids

11:08.068 --> 11:09.334
go to school.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.703
If his story checks out,
we need photos of them

11:11.705 --> 11:13.104
for an immediate Amber Alert.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.706
Let's put a call
out to the border.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.175
SPIKE:
Sending out a photo
of Helen Mitchell now.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.610
Jules, you get that?

11:18.611 --> 11:20.044
Yep. He thinks his wife
abducted their kids.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.697
Copy that.

11:21.698 --> 11:23.348
Like they're going to let him
have the kids back after this.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.184
Custody fights--
they get pretty primal.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.688
Right now, he's all tunnel
vision and short-term thinking.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.322
Well, there's primal,
and there's just plain crazy.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.224
I do crazy-ass stuff
to save other people's kids.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.225
Makes sense to me.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.761
PARKER:
What would you do?

11:36.763 --> 11:38.229
What do you mean?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.864
You and Sophie split up?

11:39.866 --> 11:41.733
It wouldn't happen.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.301
Just say you and
Sophie split up,

11:43.303 --> 11:45.103
she wanted Clark--
what would you do?

11:45.105 --> 11:47.272
Just like I said.
What?

11:47.274 --> 11:48.707
It wouldn't happen.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.875
Soon as we get eyes,

11:50.877 --> 11:52.844
let's go in.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.212
Unless I get him talking again.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.014
JULES:
<i> Have you seen her</i>

11:56.016 --> 11:58.049
or her kids today?
No, not today.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.317
What's going on?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.919
Well, your neighbor's
ex-husband is involved

12:00.921 --> 12:02.220
in an armed incident downtown.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.355
What?
We're doing
everything we can

12:04.357 --> 12:07.258
to resolve this peacefully,
but we need the bigger picture.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.260
Can you help us?
Uh, yeah.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.328
How well do you know
the Mitchells?

12:10.330 --> 12:11.429
I've known them for about

12:11.431 --> 12:13.064
six years.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.250
They used to be really
great together,

12:15.251 --> 12:17.435
but the last few years have been
pretty stressed between them.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.037
Hey, Helen.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.039
<i> Then last year,</i>
<i> they got divorced.</i>

12:21.041 --> 12:22.941
Good. Same old?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.142
Working like a dog?

12:24.144 --> 12:25.844
Yeah. So they ready?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.412
Soon.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.813
I said 4:30.

12:28.815 --> 12:29.948
Yeah, we did.
They'll be ready soon.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.116
We had an understanding,
the movie starts

12:31.118 --> 12:32.951
in 20 minutes.
Donald, no. You can't

12:32.953 --> 12:34.252
just walk right in
like you still live here.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.287
Liam! Alice!

12:36.289 --> 12:38.323
They're not here.
What?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.808
You heard me.
Where are they?

12:39.809 --> 12:41.292
They're at the store.
They'll be back in five minutes.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.795
You can't keep doing this.
You bring them late.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.296
We missed two visits
this month. I can't even say

12:45.298 --> 12:47.298
good night to them
on the phone.
They were already asleep.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.367
Or so you say.
What, you think I'm lying?

12:49.369 --> 12:52.070
No, I think I'm entitled
to say good night to my kids
three days a week!

12:52.072 --> 12:53.371
I get to say
good night to my kids

12:53.373 --> 12:55.140
on the phone
three days a week!
Don't yell at me.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.141
LIAM:
Daddy!

12:56.143 --> 12:58.510
Come here, you.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.147
Go see your daddy.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.885
Hey, buddy!

13:06.887 --> 13:08.386
Ooh, come here!

13:08.388 --> 13:09.821
Hey, Don,
how're you doing?

13:09.823 --> 13:11.056
Daddy!

13:11.057 --> 13:12.290
Allie! Allie! Allie!
Popcorn or nachos, huh?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.292
Popcorn or nachos?
Popcorn!

13:14.294 --> 13:15.927
Let's go, buddy.
Bye, Mom!
Have fun.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.164
<i> I mean, the real problem</i>
<i> was Jason.</i>

13:19.166 --> 13:20.298
Who's Jason?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.167
Jason Wallace, her boyfriend.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.236
I don't know if I should.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.571
Are you her friend?
Yeah.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.440
Well, Donald is threatening
her lawyer with a gun.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.509
I need the whole story
right now.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.981
Well, it was really hard
for Helen coming to live here

13:36.983 --> 13:39.317
away from her old life,
her parents, her friends.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.919
How is she with Donald?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.388
They used to be
head over heels.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.356
I mean, Donald proposed
a month after they met;

13:45.358 --> 13:47.358
that's how sure they were.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.960
But she was so young, you know?

13:48.962 --> 13:50.995
I mean, she gave up
her studies,

13:50.997 --> 13:52.997
her country--
everything.
Was she isolated?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.232
Did he work a lot?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.301
Oh, yeah, Donald was
always at work,

13:56.302 --> 13:58.369
talking about work, breaking
promises for work-- it was hard.

13:58.371 --> 14:01.406
She said by the end,
it was like living alone.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.575
And then along comes Jason
who appreciates her.

14:03.577 --> 14:04.976
Yeah.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.377
Ah, here she comes.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.079
Helen!

14:10.050 --> 14:11.449
JULES:
Helen Mitchell?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.318
I'm Jules Callaghan
with the SRU.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.953
What's wrong?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.421
We're trying
to locate your children.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.956
"Locate" them?

14:17.958 --> 14:19.490
They're at school.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.459
Well, the school says
that you have them.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.995
I don't have them.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.997
What are you saying?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.166
What's happened to my kids?

14:39.913 --> 14:40.879
I told you they're not here.

14:40.881 --> 14:41.980
We just need to be sure.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.281
Please, you've
got to find them.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.616
Sarge, found Helen Mitchell.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.251
She says she has no idea
where the children are.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.652
They're not in the house.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.621
All right, get to the school.
Let's find out exactly

14:49.623 --> 14:51.289
what happened.
Okay.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.035
(indistinct arguing)

15:04.037 --> 15:05.303
DONALD:
I'm going to give you

15:05.305 --> 15:07.171
one last chance!
I'm telling you...

15:07.173 --> 15:08.940
Got our first pair of eyes.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.943
Working on the closet now, boss.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.795
(over earpiece):
Copy that.

15:13.796 --> 15:15.646
Okay, if the paralegal's there,
she's hiding.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.482
Don't think I won't
hurt you! I will...

15:17.484 --> 15:19.250
Wordy, when can we see
into that closet?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.352
Uh, three, four minutes.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.954
Excellent,
two minutes, good.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.088
Yeah, yeah, fast is good.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.024
Thing is, silent drill's
kind of slow.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.159
LORRAINE:
<i> I don't understand.</i>

15:28.161 --> 15:29.661
Mrs. Mitchell called.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.162
You said a friend will
be picking up the children.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.163
That's impossible.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.665
I never called.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.300
I'm so sorry.

15:35.302 --> 15:38.536
Nothing like this has
ever happened before.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.355
What's wrong with you?

15:40.356 --> 15:42.173
You can't just hand over
my children to anybody.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.075
I mean, don't you have rules?

15:44.077 --> 15:46.177
Okay, okay.
Don't you have...?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.578
Do you have surveillance tapes?

15:47.580 --> 15:49.247
Yes. Hallways and entrances.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.949
Great. I need to see those
right away.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.550
Of course.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.228
Second eyes in, boss.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.534
Right, there she is.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.370
PARKER:
Guess we didn't get lucky.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.005
Not today.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.640
Can we get her out
without alerting Donald?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.709
Boss, there's no cover
in the room. We'd be seen.

16:17.711 --> 16:18.977
I don't know how he'd react.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.578
We go in hard.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.748
Okay. Here's the plan:
Sam, window entry.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.616
Leah, Wordy, through
the door with me.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.485
Wordy, you're on ram.
Leah, you're on D-D's.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.053
I can do the window, Ed.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.121
What's that?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.322
I've got a lot of experience
on that.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.623
You know,
burning buildings and all.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.192
Excuse me?

16:35.729 --> 16:37.729
Right. Copy that. I'm on D-D's.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.764
Good.

16:39.766 --> 16:40.765
Questions?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.233
I'm on my way up.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.402
Get into position.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.037
Guess that was a mistake

16:46.039 --> 16:47.538
When you're the democratically
elected team leader,

16:47.540 --> 16:49.040
you get to make
autocratic decisions.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.041
That one yours?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.042
No, his.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.110
Man!

16:52.112 --> 16:53.444
Don't worry.
You'll get your chance.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.621
HELEN:
There.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.725
JULES:
Do you recognize him?

17:07.727 --> 17:10.094
Oh, my God! It's Jason!

17:10.096 --> 17:12.063
Jason Wallace, your boyfriend?

17:12.065 --> 17:13.097
Why would he take

17:13.099 --> 17:14.766
your kids without
your permission?

17:14.768 --> 17:15.800
I don't know.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.635
Really, Helen?

17:17.637 --> 17:20.471
We broke up a couple days ago.

17:20.473 --> 17:24.042
He... he took it pretty bad.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.410
(sniffles)

17:25.412 --> 17:27.045
He kind of lost it.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.263
He has anger issues.

17:28.264 --> 17:29.480
Would he be angry enough
to hurt your kids?

17:29.482 --> 17:32.183
I don't know.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.419
He said I'd "regret it."

17:34.421 --> 17:35.420
Oh, my God.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.321
You got to find them!

17:37.323 --> 17:38.523
We will.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.792
Do you have
any recent pictures of him?

17:40.794 --> 17:42.126
Yes, I do.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.165
Here you go.
Okay.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.634
These are great.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.102
We're gonna get these out on the
street, put out an Amber alert.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.504
I'm gonna have
a police officer

17:53.506 --> 17:55.173
pick you up
and take you home, okay?

17:55.175 --> 17:56.741
No, I'm fine.
I don't need a ride.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.742
Helen, we need to keep

17:57.744 --> 17:59.177
in touch with you, all right?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.344
I want you to wait here, okay?

18:00.346 --> 18:03.214
They're gonna be here
in a few minutes.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.082
Okay.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.483
We're gonna find them.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.619
Sarge, we got

18:08.621 --> 18:11.222
Jason Wallace on tape
picking up the kids.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.357
So, Jason Wallace.
We got a couple of assaults

18:13.359 --> 18:15.793
on his record. Got busted a
couple of times for dealing pot.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.229
And I got an address.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.564
Let's dispatch uniforms
to contain.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.798
On my way.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.234
Pick up Sam en route, Jules.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.202
It's one guy, Sarge.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.536
I can handle it myself.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.871
He's a potentially violent man

18:26.873 --> 18:28.473
who's taken
his ex-girlfriend's kids.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.475
Sam's on entry.
He'll be done by the time

18:30.477 --> 18:33.344
you get here to pick him up.
Copy that.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.181
Winnie, I'm sending you pictures
and descriptions

18:37.183 --> 18:38.516
of Alice and Lee and Mitchell.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.617
They were last seen

18:39.619 --> 18:40.852
with Jason Wallace.

18:40.854 --> 18:41.886
You already got his description.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.354
Full Amber Alert
to all agencies.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.156
We got to find these kids fast.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.257
Copy that.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.259
For God's sake, Donald,
use your head.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.495
Why the hell would I help Helen
take your kids?

18:50.497 --> 18:52.163
Because you spent the whole
trial trying to take them.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.831
The two of you.
I was doing my job.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.266
By fabricating? Lying?

18:55.268 --> 18:56.734
There was no lying!
I worked myself ragged

18:56.736 --> 18:58.503
so she could have
what she wanted.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.821
All she wanted was a man

18:59.822 --> 19:01.138
who had a little space
in his life for her.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.640
DONALD:
Yean, I knew that!
I'd just arranged

19:02.642 --> 19:04.392
to delegate half my workload.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.143
I was coming home early
with champagne,

19:06.146 --> 19:08.479
with takeout
to surprise her,
to celebrate...

19:08.481 --> 19:10.348
So she found someone.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.216
You made her pay, right?
You say whatever it takes

19:12.218 --> 19:13.751
to make her out
to be an unfit mother!

19:13.753 --> 19:16.220
Team, they're escalating.
Stand by.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.722
DONALD:
What about you, huh?

19:17.723 --> 19:19.223
You made it sound
like I hurt the kids.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.225
I never touched them!

19:21.227 --> 19:22.894
Nobody said you did.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.262
No, you implied.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.430
You, you suggested...

19:26.432 --> 19:27.665
Sam, how long till in position?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.800
30 seconds.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.170
Boss, third party.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.304
She's looking pretty nervous.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.239
DONALD:
I think I deserve that much!

19:35.241 --> 19:37.341
She's just fighting for a chance
to have a life,

19:37.343 --> 19:39.210
to make a choice
of her own.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.912
And there you are invoking
"parental alienation,

19:40.914 --> 19:41.913
malicious mom syndrome."

19:41.915 --> 19:43.214
What do you call it?

19:43.216 --> 19:45.216
PARKER:
Don't like where this is headed.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.717
Ed, the woman in the closet

19:46.719 --> 19:48.352
is about to make a move.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.854
ED: Copy that.
Standing by.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.256
She agreed to the schedule!

19:52.258 --> 19:54.692
PARKER:
Update, Sam.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.261
SAM:
Just setting the charge, boss.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.764
ED:
Holding for you, Sam.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.366
She didn't realize...
Shut up! Forget it, okay?

20:02.368 --> 20:03.267
The only thing that
matters now is my kids.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.703
Where are they, huh?!
Stop!

20:05.705 --> 20:07.238
Stop! Stop, you!

20:07.240 --> 20:08.272
Damn it, stay there!

20:08.274 --> 20:09.207
Tell me where my kids are.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.341
He didn't do anything.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.275
Where are they?!

20:11.277 --> 20:12.343
Helen loves those kids!

20:12.345 --> 20:13.211
I love them, too!

20:13.213 --> 20:14.478
More than you could know!

20:14.480 --> 20:16.214
SPIKE:
Five seconds.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.316
Ready for entry
on my go.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.917
Do not make me hurt you!

20:19.919 --> 20:21.519
(both grunting)

20:21.521 --> 20:22.520
Stop!

20:22.522 --> 20:23.788
PARKER:
Blast is good!

20:23.790 --> 20:25.656
Three, two, one.

20:25.658 --> 20:29.727
Go, go, go, go! Police!
Right there! Right there!

20:29.729 --> 20:32.363
Hands in the air!
Police!

20:32.365 --> 20:33.631
Get your hands down now!

20:33.633 --> 20:35.900
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.603
(handcuffs rasp, Donald groans)

20:38.605 --> 20:39.837
Let's take a walk.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.405
You good?

20:42.942 --> 20:44.475
I'll get you down
to a paramedic.

20:46.512 --> 20:47.845
Listen.
Would you just listen?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.747
You gotta stop her!
You gotta do something!

20:49.749 --> 20:51.449
Sir, the man you had
at gunpoint...

20:51.451 --> 20:52.750
He's hiding my
wife and kids!

20:52.752 --> 20:54.418
If they get out
of the country,

20:54.420 --> 20:55.870
I'll never see them again.

20:55.871 --> 20:57.321
And why do you think
he's involved?

20:57.323 --> 20:58.789
Because the bastard did
everything that he could

20:58.791 --> 20:59.824
to take them from me.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.827
He's a lawyer.
That is his job.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.329
It's more than that.
It is way more than that.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.465
It's something I heard him say
at the pretrial.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.939
Please, Donald,

21:14.941 --> 21:16.707
don't take Liam and Alice
away from me.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.442
They're all I've got.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.444
No, you've got someone else.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.446
Why is it always about him?

21:22.448 --> 21:23.914
Because I loved you, Helen.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.683
We could all have
all stayed together,

21:25.685 --> 21:27.285
but you made your choice.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.986
Fine. I'll leave him today.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.889
Anything. Please,
just stop this, okay?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.394
I can't trust you anymore.

21:41.434 --> 21:44.535
If you're willing
to break up with Jason,

21:44.537 --> 21:47.071
maybe we can still
work something out.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.407
Anything.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.008
I'll do anything.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.544
I'd even get back together
with Donald.

21:53.546 --> 21:57.014
HELEN:
Really? I'd rather
be buried alive.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.483
But to keep my kids--

21:59.485 --> 22:02.453
anything.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.188
Don't worry.

22:04.189 --> 22:05.922
Whatever it takes, we
won't let you lose them.

22:06.926 --> 22:10.995
ADAM:
Whatever it takes, all right?

22:10.997 --> 22:12.863
Thank you.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.766
I was just about to say,
"Maybe we can work this out."

22:15.768 --> 22:17.368
Then I heard
her say it.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.837
What did I ever do to make her
hate me so much?

22:21.107 --> 22:23.074
I didn't think
about it till later.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.442
"Whatever it takes,"

22:24.443 --> 22:25.809
she wouldn't lose the kids.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.111
DONALD:
And that's what he did.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.646
Anything it took.

22:28.648 --> 22:29.914
He helped her take them.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.949
He knows where they're
going right now.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.584
Okay, Donald, we talked
to your wife.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.419
And there's no indication

22:35.421 --> 22:36.554
that she's got
the children with her.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.855
Then who picked them up
from school?

22:37.857 --> 22:38.956
Jason Wallace.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.758
Jason?

22:40.760 --> 22:43.027
He took them on his own?

22:43.029 --> 22:45.496
We don't have
the answer to that.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.731
Oh, my God.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.132
You got to get them back.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.533
You got to get
them back.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.804
Boss, we have a situation.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.873
Uniforms report Jason Wallace
wasn't at home.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.508
Neighbors saw him leave.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.043
What about the kids?

22:59.045 --> 23:00.945
Unconfirmed,
but we found juice boxes.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.413
Could be his.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.115
Spotty Leopard Jungle Nectar?

23:04.117 --> 23:06.517
Well, they were there.
Where are they now?

23:06.519 --> 23:08.018
JULES:
We just did a credit card check.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.621
He checked into the Royal York
about ten minutes ago.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.556
Okay, good work.
Keep me posted.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.492
Did you promise
Helen Mitchell

23:14.494 --> 23:17.395
that she would get her children
back no matter what it takes?

23:17.397 --> 23:19.630
I tell my clients
what they need to hear

23:19.632 --> 23:22.400
to build their confidence, but I
never make misleading promises.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.168
And you didn't have
any backup plan?

23:24.170 --> 23:27.505
Like facilitating an abduction
along with her boyfriend?

23:27.507 --> 23:30.441
Break the law?
Risk my career? (scoffs)

23:30.443 --> 23:32.076
There's plenty of
times I'd like to.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.944
I got kids of my own.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.679
How about you, Amanda?

23:35.681 --> 23:37.615
You got kids?

23:37.617 --> 23:39.183
Yeah.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.584
You're not sure?

23:40.586 --> 23:43.554
Ye-Yes, I have three children.

23:46.492 --> 23:47.792
(sirens wailing)

23:52.765 --> 23:54.465
(lock opening)

23:54.467 --> 23:56.167
Police! SRU!
Police! Don't move!

23:56.169 --> 23:58.803
Hands in the air!
Hands in the air!
Do not move!

24:11.184 --> 24:12.483
Stop!

24:17.457 --> 24:19.190
(groans)

24:19.192 --> 24:21.525
Where are they?!
Where are Helen's kids?

24:21.527 --> 24:24.962
I don't know!
I swear, I don't know!

24:31.704 --> 24:33.204
You're lying.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.506
I'm telling you I haven't
seen those kids in weeks.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.141
Jason, the school
has video surveillance.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.910
You were caught on tape two
hours ago with the children.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.679
I want to speak to a lawyer.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.747
No, you want to speak to us,
okay?

24:43.749 --> 24:45.049
This is kidnapping,

24:45.051 --> 24:46.250
and you have a record.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.551
If we don't find those kids,

24:47.553 --> 24:49.053
things won't look too good
for you.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.154
I've got nothing to say.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.756
Sarge, we got Jason Wallace.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.058
No kids at the hotel.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.260
And this guy is not talking.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.228
Keep trying.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.997
Sorry about that.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.565
So two girls, boy--

25:01.567 --> 25:03.067
they live with you?

25:03.069 --> 25:06.237
They live with their father?

25:06.239 --> 25:09.240
SPIKE:
Boss, I just got off the phone
with the uniform

25:09.242 --> 25:11.141
we sent to the kids' school
to take Helen home.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.193
Yeah, Spike?

25:12.194 --> 25:13.244
She was gone when he got there.

25:13.246 --> 25:14.912
And she's not at her house
either.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.915
So Helen isn't at the school,
she isn't at home.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.750
This is interesting.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.151
Where would she go next?

25:21.153 --> 25:22.653
She's got an older sister--
Colleen.

25:22.655 --> 25:23.787
I got her address.

25:23.789 --> 25:24.989
Sister Colleen.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.757
Leah...

25:26.759 --> 25:29.627
I want you to go to the house,
see what the sister knows.

25:29.629 --> 25:30.928
Copy that.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.930
Amanda?

25:32.932 --> 25:33.931
Anything we
should know here?

25:38.938 --> 25:41.605
So why are you being so
loyal to an ex-girlfriend?

25:41.607 --> 25:44.608
What do you mean?
Well, she said that you guys
broke up two days ago.

25:44.610 --> 25:45.776
No, that's not true.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.077
Apparently, she was
willing to leave you

25:47.079 --> 25:48.946
if it meant she could
hang on to the kids.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.281
Where'd you get that?

25:50.283 --> 25:51.949
According to Donald.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.284
Yeah, he wishes.

25:53.286 --> 25:54.986
Yeah, well, when Helen
saw the surveillance tape

25:54.987 --> 25:56.687
she freaked and she made you
out to be a dangerous, angry guy

25:56.689 --> 25:58.556
who would take it out
on those kids.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.324
She said what
she had to say.

26:00.326 --> 26:01.892
Why would she lie?

26:01.894 --> 26:02.927
Because she loves those kids.

26:02.929 --> 26:03.994
She needed time.

26:07.033 --> 26:10.000
PARKER:
How long you been working
custody cases, Amanda?

26:10.002 --> 26:11.702
A long time. 18 years.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.337
Must feel good to win.

26:13.339 --> 26:16.040
What feels good is working
on a settlement.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.575
Letting both parents
see the kids.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.144
Mr. Westfall always
tries to do that.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.645
ED:
But that didn't
happen this time.

26:21.647 --> 26:24.048
Donald was so bitter
and angry,

26:24.050 --> 26:25.783
he just wouldn't listen
to reason.

26:25.785 --> 26:29.053
Well, how even-keeled was Helen?

26:29.055 --> 26:31.489
She adored those kids.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.924
Every mother loves her kids,
but they were everything.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.627
She gave up
everything for them.

26:36.629 --> 26:37.995
She raised them
practically alone.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.663
Every minute of hers
was theirs.

26:39.665 --> 26:41.198
It just wasn't fair.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.900
It hurts to lose,
doesn't it?

26:45.071 --> 26:47.638
I have a question
to ask you.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.240
As you know,

26:50.242 --> 26:53.277
things will go a lot better
for you if you tell the truth.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.282
She deserves better
than to be a housekeeper

26:58.284 --> 27:00.384
to some guy who comes
home late every night

27:00.386 --> 27:01.619
expecting dinner
on the table.

27:01.621 --> 27:02.886
He won't even
talk to her.

27:02.888 --> 27:04.321
Okay, let's stick
to the point, Jason.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.923
We're not here because
you had an affair.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.625
She loves to go dancing.

27:07.627 --> 27:08.826
She deserves to just be able

27:08.828 --> 27:10.728
to kick back and enjoy
something for once.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.196
Okay, we get it, you love her.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.698
But do you really want
to go to jail for this?

27:14.700 --> 27:16.200
Because that's what will happen

27:16.202 --> 27:18.902
if we do not find
those children.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.639
(sighs)

27:21.641 --> 27:23.374
I dropped them off
with her sister.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.242
Helen didn't want
the kids at her house

27:25.244 --> 27:26.977
in case Donald came there.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.648
Sarge, confirming
that the children

27:30.650 --> 27:32.049
were dropped off
at the sister's.

27:32.051 --> 27:35.653
Thanks, Jules.

27:35.655 --> 27:37.388
You knew things weren't going
to go her way,

27:37.390 --> 27:39.189
so you helped her
with plan "B."

27:39.191 --> 27:40.991
Amanda.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.663
I helped her forge a letter
of parental consent.

27:47.733 --> 27:49.400
You need one
to cross the border.

27:49.402 --> 27:52.236
I used signatures from Donald.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.706
She deserved them.

27:55.708 --> 27:59.710
She deserved them.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.412
I didn't say she didn't.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.158
Colleen Lester?

28:14.160 --> 28:15.726
I'm Leah Kerns, SRU.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.795
I'm looking for
your sister, Helen.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.046
Is something wrong?

28:19.047 --> 28:20.296
Her children are missing.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.166
But that's impossible.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.368
They were with me.
She just picked them up.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.836
You must have
just missed her.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.839
Helen and the kids just left.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.274
They can't be far.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.411
I see her.

28:34.413 --> 28:35.779
And she's got the kids.
(tires squealing)

28:35.781 --> 28:37.748
She's traveling
north on Spadina.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.983
Alpha-Two-Julia-Lima-271.

28:39.985 --> 28:41.485
I'm in pursuit.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.855
(siren wailing)
(tires squealing)

28:44.857 --> 28:46.990
Okay, we're on our way.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.827
Keep a distance;
not to provoke her.

28:49.829 --> 28:50.961
Let's move.
Take me with you.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.396
I want to make sure
they're all right.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.065
It's a little late
in the game for that, Donald.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.101
Oh, boss, come on,
you're not going to take him.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.435
Stressful situation
for the kids.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.337
It might be good to have
the other parent there.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.773
Come on, if it was your boy,
what would you want?

29:02.775 --> 29:04.108
You talking about my boy
or your boy?

29:05.978 --> 29:08.278
Follow us.

29:10.015 --> 29:12.082
SPIKE:
Boss, the car Helen's driving

29:12.084 --> 29:14.351
is registered to Jason Wallace.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.787
Copy.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.123
You didn't tell us that
you lent Helen your car.
You didn't ask.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.924
Is there anything else
you didn't tell us?

29:22.461 --> 29:24.862
If you find Helen,
don't hurt her.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.797
Please.
Why would we hurt her?

29:26.799 --> 29:30.467
(sighs)
There's a gun in the car.

29:32.505 --> 29:34.838
Awesome.

29:42.481 --> 29:48.318
(phone ringing)

29:48.487 --> 29:51.255
LIAM:
Mom, are you going
to answer the phone?

29:51.257 --> 29:53.557
HELEN: It's just
a wrong number.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.492
ALICE:
Can we play the
beetle game, Mommy?

29:55.494 --> 29:56.994
Okay, I'm the only beetle
in the world

29:56.996 --> 29:58.195
that can flip from its back

29:58.197 --> 29:59.930
to its feet
in one move.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.332
The click beetle.
The click beetle.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.151
Yippee.

30:04.152 --> 30:05.969
Okay, I'm the one
with the big antlers

30:05.971 --> 30:06.970
like a moose.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.005
The stag beetle.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.006
Uh-oh, Mommy,

30:09.008 --> 30:10.407
I spilled.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.111
Hold on.

30:14.113 --> 30:16.280
That's okay.

30:16.282 --> 30:19.116
I'm the one

30:19.118 --> 30:20.217
that eats poop.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.351
Dung beetle.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.020
Yay.

30:24.890 --> 30:26.523
Still following. Looks like
she's heading out of town.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.392
PARKER:
We're right behind you.

30:42.608 --> 30:45.375
(phone ringing)

30:45.377 --> 30:48.946
LIAM:
Mom, the phone
keeps ringing.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.215
She's still not picking up.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.050
All right, we got
to make a move.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.351
What are you thinking?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.353
There's kids on board.
We got to take it easy.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.422
We can't use road spikes,
we can't ram them.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.292
We got to do a
rolling roadblock.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.328
Eddie, she's got
a weapon in the car.

31:04.330 --> 31:05.996
She's driving under stress.
She's volatile.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.632
We start crowding her...
She's not talking, boss.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.968
It's time to make a move.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.270
Spike, Spike,

31:13.272 --> 31:16.206
the make of her car-- any chance
she's got one of those

31:16.208 --> 31:17.574
onboard emergency
communications systems?

31:17.576 --> 31:20.110
Checking, checking...

31:20.112 --> 31:21.245
Do I get to say "bingo"?

31:21.247 --> 31:23.313
Only if it's a yes.
Bingo.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.414
Awesome.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.350
Let's make this happen.

31:27.953 --> 31:31.355
What about the one that
can fly, crawl and swim?

31:31.357 --> 31:33.423
Mommy, where are we going?

31:33.425 --> 31:35.325
Remember how you guys said

31:35.327 --> 31:37.928
you'd really, really love
to see Ireland?

31:37.930 --> 31:39.496
Yay!

31:39.498 --> 31:41.498
Ha, so we're gonna drive
a little bit,

31:41.500 --> 31:45.102
and then we're gonna get
on a big airplane.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.103
(electronic chirp)

31:46.105 --> 31:47.638
PARKER:
Helen Mitchell?

31:47.640 --> 31:49.306
Hi. My name is Gregory Parker.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.174
I was trying to reach you
on your cell.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.476
Can you hear me all right?

31:52.478 --> 31:55.913
Hi, Liam, hi, Alice.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.214
You guys doing okay?

31:57.216 --> 31:58.315
We're fine.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.349
They're fine.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.018
It's kind of funny, huh?

32:01.020 --> 32:03.320
A voice coming out of the car.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.390
It's actually a security feature
in case people need help,

32:06.392 --> 32:07.457
and I'm a policeman.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.692
We're going to Ireland.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.694
You are?

32:10.696 --> 32:13.363
It's so beautiful there.
It's so beautiful there.

32:13.365 --> 32:16.266
Helen, do you think you can pull
over so we can talk a little?

32:16.268 --> 32:18.368
(sighs)

32:18.370 --> 32:20.404
No. leave us alone.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.673
(engine revving)

32:22.675 --> 32:26.610
Helen, Helen, I'm just thinking
of everybody's safety here.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.313
You think you can slow it down?
LIAM:
Mom, I'm scared.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.184
All right, Eddie, let's go
for the rolling roadblock.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.370
Jules, move in front.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.555
Leah, get the side.
I'll take the rear.
Copy that.

32:38.557 --> 32:41.124
Uniforms are now
diverting traffic.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.961
Copy that.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.198
(tires squealing)

32:53.372 --> 32:54.471
Mommy.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.040
It's okay.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.509
LIAM:
But there's police cars.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.614
Everything's going
to be all right.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.520
(electronic chirp)

33:10.522 --> 33:13.056
PARKER:
Helen, it's Greg again.
I just want you to know

33:13.057 --> 33:15.591
what we're doing so you guys
aren't worried, all right?

33:15.594 --> 33:18.295
Everything's okay.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.530
These cars are just going
to help you slow down safely.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.399
Nobody's in trouble, all right?

33:22.401 --> 33:25.035
Jules, I'm closing 15 feet.

33:25.037 --> 33:26.570
ED:
Start decelerating.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.239
It's okay.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.342
Let's tighten it up.

33:32.344 --> 33:36.179
ED:
<i> Decelerate.</i>

33:42.721 --> 33:45.655
(siren wails)

33:48.627 --> 33:51.128
(sirens wailing)

33:51.130 --> 33:52.729
Come on, come on.
Hi, Helen.

33:52.731 --> 33:53.797
Get out, get out.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.599
Stay away from us!
Come on.

33:55.601 --> 33:56.700
I'm Greg. Hi.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.068
HELEN:
It's okay. It's okay.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.102
PARKER:
Hi, Liam.

33:59.104 --> 34:00.537
Hi, Alice.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.439
How are you guys?

34:02.441 --> 34:06.576
I'm the man who was talking
to your mom in the car earlier.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.279
ED:
Boss, you need a shield.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.447
Mommy.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.516
What are you doing?
Why do you have a gun?

34:12.518 --> 34:13.550
How you guys doing?

34:13.552 --> 34:15.419
I'm scared, Mommy.

34:15.421 --> 34:16.820
Boss, wait for the shield.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.622
She thinks the system's
against her, Ed.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.424
She needs to see some trust.

34:20.426 --> 34:21.558
It's not...
It's a mistake.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.659
But I know you got my back.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.595
Right.
Good, Eddie. I'm good.

34:25.597 --> 34:26.630
Stay close to me.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.165
(panicked gasp)

34:28.167 --> 34:29.499
That gun comes up...

34:29.501 --> 34:31.168
I have to take the shot.

34:35.140 --> 34:36.406
HELEN:
Nobody's going to hurt you.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.574
I won't let anybody
hurt you, okay?

34:37.576 --> 34:39.609
Helen?

34:40.679 --> 34:42.612
Look at me, Helen.

34:42.614 --> 34:43.780
Look at me.

34:43.782 --> 34:47.584
I'm going to put this down.

34:47.586 --> 34:48.618
Okay? So we can talk.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.719
ED:
Boss...

34:49.721 --> 34:51.588
You don't want to do that.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.590
Think you can do
the same for me?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.558
Please?

34:54.560 --> 34:55.725
No.

34:55.727 --> 34:57.527
What does she think
she's going to do?

34:57.529 --> 34:59.596
She's not thinking.
That's the problem.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.599
How do you reach a person
who's gone primal mother bear?

35:02.601 --> 35:03.767
Through her cubs.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.702
It's okay.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.572
You can just...

35:08.574 --> 35:10.507
Just try to keep it down.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.842
How's that?

35:11.844 --> 35:15.145
Hey, guys.

35:15.147 --> 35:18.715
I know your mom loves you
more than anything.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.118
You know how I know that?

35:21.120 --> 35:24.621
Because of everything
she's done today.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.626
She's a smart lady.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.695
I'll bet you

35:31.697 --> 35:34.631
she's taught you
to never talk to strangers.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.867
You're not a stranger.
You're a policeman.

35:36.869 --> 35:39.503
Yeah, that's right.
I am.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.138
Just let us go.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.205
Let us through.

35:42.207 --> 35:43.874
I could do that, I guess.

35:43.876 --> 35:47.144
I'm not really sure where things
go after that, though, so...

35:47.146 --> 35:50.147
You probably won't get
through the border.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.482
Even with those documents
that Amanda made for you.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.518
The airport, then.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.621
Mom's told you a lot
about Ireland, huh?

35:57.623 --> 35:59.189
I've been there once.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.658
You know what they say
about Ireland? It's true.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.561
It's really, really green.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.263
And your mom wants
to take you there

36:06.265 --> 36:08.265
because she wants
you guys to be able

36:08.267 --> 36:09.799
to stay together, right?

36:09.801 --> 36:11.735
They need me.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.537
I know.

36:13.539 --> 36:16.506
But let's say you guys
got on that plane today.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.809
You'll never be able
to come back.

36:19.811 --> 36:22.879
You know that, right?

36:22.881 --> 36:25.515
Mom, what about Daddy?

36:25.517 --> 36:27.551
It's not right.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.719
He lied to them.

36:29.721 --> 36:33.190
He told them
I was malicious, unfit,

36:33.192 --> 36:34.824
irresponsible!

36:34.826 --> 36:37.794
You sure it wasn't just
his lawyer doing his job?

36:40.432 --> 36:42.399
I mean, the way
he talks about you...

36:42.401 --> 36:44.434
I'm not convinced

36:44.436 --> 36:46.536
he believed it himself.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.871
But then why...

36:47.873 --> 36:49.673
'Cause he loves you?

36:49.675 --> 36:53.643
And when he lost you,
he got angry

36:53.645 --> 36:55.712
and he felt helpless and no
one wants to feel that way.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.981
No one wants to have their
kids taken away from them.

36:57.983 --> 37:02.552
People go to extremes
for something they love, right?

37:02.554 --> 37:05.722
Helen?

37:05.724 --> 37:07.257
Yeah.

37:09.261 --> 37:10.627
Okay, let's get the dad out.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.929
Let them see him.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.998
I hear you.

37:16.768 --> 37:20.337
It's okay, kids.
It's all right.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.538
No one's going to hurt you.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.572
No one's going
to hurt your mom.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.640
It's going to be okay.

37:23.642 --> 37:26.743
I promise, it's all
going to be okay.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.711
Daddy!
Daddy!

37:27.713 --> 37:28.812
ALICE:
Daddy!

37:28.814 --> 37:30.513
No! Wait!

37:30.515 --> 37:31.748
Helen, listen to me.

37:31.750 --> 37:32.816
You haven't hurt
anyone. You haven't

37:32.818 --> 37:34.551
threatened anyone,
and that's good.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.386
It means you'll be
with your kids again

37:36.388 --> 37:38.688
sooner rather than later.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.491
But if you raise that gun
right now, everything changes.

37:41.493 --> 37:45.428
So, please, please
just put the gun down.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.497
(sobbing)

37:51.770 --> 37:53.303
Don't you dare.

37:53.305 --> 37:54.871
Don't make me go there.

37:54.873 --> 37:58.441
Donald.

37:58.443 --> 37:59.776
What happened?
What have you done?

37:59.778 --> 38:03.747
I thought I was losing the kids.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.649
Losing you.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.017
(sobs)

38:09.655 --> 38:11.721
What have we done?

38:11.723 --> 38:12.889
Thank you, Helen.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.491
What have we done?

38:14.493 --> 38:16.860
It's okay.

38:25.504 --> 38:29.572
¶ We get lost
in pursuit of glory ¶

38:31.810 --> 38:36.646
¶ And find ourselves
lost in the night ¶

38:39.584 --> 38:42.752
¶ Ego has no intuition ¶

38:45.524 --> 38:51.027
¶ We need headlines
every night, yeah ¶

38:53.332 --> 38:59.469
¶ Those mistakes you made
don't make you half a man ¶

38:59.471 --> 39:03.907
¶ There is weakness
where there's pride ¶

39:06.845 --> 39:09.012
¶ A broken heart don't mean... ¶

39:09.014 --> 39:12.716
Hey, that's great.
Thank you.

39:12.718 --> 39:15.585
They'll be able to stay
with her sister Colleen.

39:17.589 --> 39:20.523
When kids are involved,
it's hard to see straight.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.026
It affects your judgment.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.763
Yeah. Yeah, I hope like hell
they get a second chance.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.566
WOMAN:
Yeah, that sounds great.
See you tomorrow.

39:29.568 --> 39:32.736
I'm talking
about you here, Greg.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.838
What are you saying?

39:34.840 --> 39:36.740
You were thinking
about your kid out there.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.642
My choices were appropriate.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.011
Your choices
were dangerous.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.446
You know what, Eddie?

39:43.448 --> 39:45.915
All the calls have
an element of risk.

39:45.917 --> 39:49.452
You want me to
watch your back.

39:49.454 --> 39:53.490
Boss, this is me
watching your back.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.924
I'm just saying.

39:54.926 --> 40:00.029
¶ And there is weakness
where there's pride ¶

40:02.801 --> 40:08.438
¶ A broken heart don't mean
a broken girl within ¶

40:08.440 --> 40:16.946
¶ It's not a sin
to start again ¶

40:16.948 --> 40:22.585
¶<i> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i> ¶

40:23.789 --> 40:30.960
¶<i> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i> ¶

40:30.962 --> 40:35.899
¶ Ooh ¶
¶<i> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i> ¶

40:37.803 --> 40:43.907
¶<i> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i> ¶

40:44.943 --> 40:47.577
¶<i> Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i> ¶
