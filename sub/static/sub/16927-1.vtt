00:58.001 --> 00:59.969
You're not looking at me, Mike.

01:02.706 --> 01:04.936
You're not looking at me in the eyes.

01:06.443 --> 01:07.740
That's weak.

01:08.578 --> 01:10.239
Only weak people do that.

01:13.717 --> 01:16.686
I could look you in the eye
if I wanted to, Daddy.

01:19.256 --> 01:21.520
I just don't wanna look you in the eye.

01:22.426 --> 01:24.826
I guess you're just a weak person.

01:26.296 --> 01:28.423
You must have got that from your mother.

01:29.332 --> 01:32.301
It probably would have been better for you...

01:32.803 --> 01:34.771
to have been born a girl.

01:36.106 --> 01:38.131
Then we could have named you Michelle.

01:40.644 --> 01:43.511
You see, weakness is more acceptable
in a girl, Michelle.

01:45.115 --> 01:46.878
I'm sorry, I mean, Mike.

01:47.784 --> 01:49.411
I keep forgetting.

01:52.656 --> 01:54.123
Wait a minute.

01:54.991 --> 01:57.186
Why don't I call you Michelle all the time?

01:58.428 --> 02:02.296
Then I wouldn't have to be so goddamn
ashamed of you and your weaknesses.

02:02.933 --> 02:05.163
I could think of you as a girl all the time...

02:05.268 --> 02:09.261
by your frocks, dresses,
and frilly hats and scarves.

02:09.372 --> 02:11.203
You could be Daddy's little girl.

02:11.308 --> 02:16.268
I wouldn't have to be so fucking ashamed
of being seen with you in public, would I?

02:17.848 --> 02:19.782
What do you think of that, Michelle?

02:20.550 --> 02:22.211
Sound like a good idea?

02:22.819 --> 02:24.047
Don't, Daddy.

02:25.956 --> 02:26.923
What?

02:28.191 --> 02:29.920
Did you say something?

02:30.360 --> 02:33.557
Such a soft little girl's voice.
I couldn't hear what you said.

02:35.298 --> 02:36.390
I hate you, Daddy.

02:37.334 --> 02:39.802
- Speak up, girl!
- I hate you!

02:41.338 --> 02:44.034
I hate you, because I love...

02:46.409 --> 02:48.104
It makes me feel...

02:48.712 --> 02:50.612
guilty inside, hate.

02:52.783 --> 02:54.751
I can't let the heart speak.

02:55.552 --> 02:57.144
Then don't speak.

02:57.821 --> 02:59.652
Don't speak to me. Show me.

02:59.756 --> 03:02.725
Don't tell me.
I'm not interested in what little girls say.

03:02.826 --> 03:03.850
Show me!

03:03.960 --> 03:06.394
Show me your anger.
Then I can understand it.

03:10.801 --> 03:12.428
There you are, Daddy.

03:18.642 --> 03:20.405
I see you, Michelle.

03:22.879 --> 03:24.278
I see everything.

03:25.882 --> 03:27.509
This is me, Daddy.

03:29.352 --> 03:31.149
This is what you do to me inside.

03:33.356 --> 03:35.324
Go all the way through it.

03:37.327 --> 03:39.261
Go all the way through it to the end.

03:40.730 --> 03:42.391
Come out the other end.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.633
Don't stop in the middle.

03:45.702 --> 03:47.329
I'm watching you.

03:47.904 --> 03:49.838
I'm watching everything you do, Mike.

04:15.799 --> 04:16.766
Wow.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.963
The man is a genius.

04:23.139 --> 04:26.131
Dr. Raglan would like to thank you all
for coming this afternoon.

04:26.243 --> 04:28.905
I believe your bus is waiting outside now.
Thank you.

05:21.031 --> 05:21.998
Candy...

05:22.732 --> 05:24.029
it's me, honey.

05:35.412 --> 05:36.640
Daddy.

06:13.116 --> 06:14.310
Okay, honey.

06:16.019 --> 06:17.384
Warm enough?

06:31.835 --> 06:34.395
Okay, put the whale down. Turn around.

06:35.538 --> 06:37.233
Hold your hair up.

06:47.751 --> 06:48.809
Oh, my God.

07:08.104 --> 07:09.162
Sorry, Hal...

07:09.272 --> 07:11.240
but Mr. Carveth is still here.

07:11.341 --> 07:14.401
He's starting to get passionate
about the whole thing.

07:15.445 --> 07:16.776
Okay, send him in.

07:18.982 --> 07:19.949
Mr. Carveth.

07:21.384 --> 07:22.817
Thanks a lot.

07:22.952 --> 07:25.113
Frank, it's been some time.

07:26.990 --> 07:28.514
What can I do for you?

07:28.625 --> 07:30.058
I want to see Nola.

07:30.226 --> 07:32.160
I want to see my wife, now.

07:32.429 --> 07:35.262
You know she's still undergoing
intensive therapy.

07:35.598 --> 07:37.657
I can't let you break that isolation.

07:38.368 --> 07:41.064
You let her see Candice
on the weekends, don't you?

07:41.204 --> 07:43.638
Yes, Frank, I do. But that's different.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.471
Visits from her daughter
was in her program from the very start.

07:47.977 --> 07:50.207
Her program has just changed.

07:50.847 --> 07:52.405
What do you mean?

07:52.882 --> 07:54.372
You sound hostile.

07:54.884 --> 07:57.444
My daughter's been beaten severely...

07:58.188 --> 07:59.815
and scratched and bitten!

07:59.923 --> 08:01.117
Her mother did it...

08:01.224 --> 08:04.284
her mother,
who is under your psychiatric care.

08:06.629 --> 08:10.429
That's an incredibly heavy
accusation to make.

08:13.269 --> 08:15.100
Did Candice tell you that?

08:16.439 --> 08:18.304
Candice won't talk about it.

08:19.609 --> 08:21.839
She pretends
the whole thing never happened.

08:22.145 --> 08:23.339
But it was Nola...

08:23.446 --> 08:26.438
or some other crazy
you have stashed away up here.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.881
Either way, no more weekends with Mommy.

08:28.985 --> 08:30.680
The kid stays with me.

08:32.621 --> 08:35.352
To take Candice away from her
at this stage...

08:36.426 --> 08:38.587
could send Nola over into the deep end.

08:39.229 --> 08:41.390
It's a critical time for her.

08:42.164 --> 08:46.397
I happen to think that Nola's
been in over her head for a long time now.

08:47.237 --> 08:49.899
You have no legal right to deny access.

08:50.740 --> 08:53.937
Any time you'd like
to test the matter in open court...

08:55.278 --> 08:57.109
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

08:58.781 --> 09:01.648
For the ultimate good
of your own family, Frank...

09:03.219 --> 09:05.084
we'd be prepared to do just that.

09:06.189 --> 09:08.054
But don't you force it.

09:08.458 --> 09:11.825
You bring Candy back to her mother
next weekend. She won't harm her.

09:11.928 --> 09:14.897
There must be some other answer
to what you've seen.

09:14.998 --> 09:16.932
Until you give me that answer...

09:17.667 --> 09:19.635
Candy is not coming back.

09:36.186 --> 09:37.448
<i>Yes, Hal?</i>

09:39.055 --> 09:41.853
Prepare Nola Carveth
for another session tonight, will you?

09:41.958 --> 09:42.925
Sure.

09:43.126 --> 09:44.320
And, Chris...

09:45.094 --> 09:47.392
make it phase two, after supper.

09:47.530 --> 09:48.690
<i>Okay, Hal.</i>

09:52.969 --> 09:56.461
This guy Raglan
is strictly an emotional opportunist.

09:56.573 --> 09:58.734
He's a legit M.D., right?

09:58.841 --> 10:00.832
He's a real psychiatrist.

10:02.612 --> 10:03.670
Yes.

10:05.949 --> 10:08.850
Goddamn it, psychoplasmics is a rip-off.

10:09.919 --> 10:11.944
It's a sideshow. I've seen it in action.

10:13.223 --> 10:16.454
It doesn't matter what you think.
You listen to me.

10:18.161 --> 10:21.597
You call up this Raglan,
and you be a real mensch with him.

10:22.865 --> 10:27.063
Otherwise, it's just a matter of time
before the cops show up at your door...

10:27.170 --> 10:29.331
and you lose your kid for good.

10:30.006 --> 10:31.997
The law believes in motherhood.

10:35.712 --> 10:38.340
If I can dig up enough testimony to prove...

10:38.448 --> 10:43.112
that Raglan's a dangerous fraud,
that Somafree is crawling with crazies...

10:44.087 --> 10:46.078
it's no place for a kid, any time...

10:48.191 --> 10:49.818
You're getting warmer.

10:50.426 --> 10:53.987
But when Candy doesn't show up
at Somafree next weekend...

10:54.097 --> 10:56.622
your wife can take legal action immediately.

10:57.934 --> 11:01.461
You could find yourself belted with a writ
in seven days.

11:03.940 --> 11:07.000
If I give Nola enough time,
she'll really hurt the kid.

11:08.111 --> 11:09.601
I know she will.

11:12.582 --> 11:14.345
I'll do anything I have to.

12:02.365 --> 12:03.764
Here's your daddy.

12:05.168 --> 12:08.035
I bet he knows all about this zipper.
There we go.

12:10.139 --> 12:11.333
All set, now.

12:17.313 --> 12:19.907
I'd love to talk to you
sometime soon, Mr. Carveth...

12:20.016 --> 12:22.849
about school activities and Candy.

12:24.187 --> 12:26.155
You missed the last open house.

12:28.524 --> 12:30.151
Okay, soon.

12:35.665 --> 12:36.632
Thanks.

12:37.367 --> 12:39.062
See you tomorrow, Candy.

12:44.741 --> 12:46.504
Thank you very much, Frank.

12:47.143 --> 12:49.611
- For what?
- For bringing me my grandchild.

12:50.446 --> 12:53.347
I know if it were up to Nola,
I'd never see Candice.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.312
Juliana, that's not true.

12:55.551 --> 12:59.282
Nola and I both know how much
she needs her grandma, especially now.

13:00.223 --> 13:01.417
You're sweet.

13:05.161 --> 13:07.561
I guess you know, now, what it feels like.

13:08.297 --> 13:10.788
- What it feels like?
- Being a parent.

13:13.035 --> 13:14.832
Being blamed for everything.

13:15.104 --> 13:18.801
To have the past distorted, so you
don't even recognize yourself anymore.

13:18.908 --> 13:21.342
Your child's version of the past, that is.

13:22.578 --> 13:24.773
Juliana, Candice is only five.

13:25.681 --> 13:28.172
She's working on it right now, believe me.

13:30.219 --> 13:33.017
Thirty seconds after you're born,
you have a past.

13:33.122 --> 13:36.717
And 60 seconds after that,
you start to lie to yourself about it.

13:42.031 --> 13:46.491
I guess I've been indulging in a horrid bout
of nostalgia these last few days.

13:47.136 --> 13:50.697
It must be the weather.
At least now I have a partner in crime.

13:51.007 --> 13:53.373
- I've got to go.
- Of course.

13:56.446 --> 13:57.538
'Bye, Daddy.

14:08.591 --> 14:10.991
Take your time, we'll both be just fine.

14:25.241 --> 14:26.902
I'll be with you in a second, sweetie.

14:27.009 --> 14:31.275
I'm just gonna get a refill, and then
we'll look at those lovely old pictures.

14:33.883 --> 14:34.850
Mommy.

14:37.653 --> 14:38.847
Yes, Candice?

14:39.922 --> 14:41.048
Yes, sweetie?

14:43.392 --> 14:44.859
Mommy, you hurt me.

14:46.496 --> 14:50.296
You hit me with your fists,
and then you scratched me with your nails.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.426
You hurt me.

14:53.135 --> 14:54.864
I didn't, sweetie.

14:55.471 --> 14:57.371
You must have had a bad dream.

14:58.241 --> 15:01.642
Mommies don't do that.
Mommies don't hurt their own children.

15:03.246 --> 15:04.338
They don't?

15:05.982 --> 15:07.176
They never do?

15:15.091 --> 15:16.490
They sometimes do.

15:18.661 --> 15:22.620
Sometimes, but then they're bad mommies,
they're fucked-up mommies.

15:24.233 --> 15:25.325
Like whose?

15:26.636 --> 15:28.001
Like whose mommy?

15:32.475 --> 15:33.703
Like mine was.

15:36.846 --> 15:38.245
Fucked up and bad.

15:40.716 --> 15:42.115
No, I'm not, Nola.

15:43.419 --> 15:46.650
You're being so unfair, sweetheart.
Mommies never do that.

15:48.090 --> 15:50.388
Mommies never hurt their own children.

15:52.395 --> 15:53.726
You did hurt me.

15:55.698 --> 15:57.757
You beat me and you scratched me.

15:58.701 --> 16:00.566
You threw me down the stairs.

16:01.804 --> 16:03.271
Show me what I did.

16:04.273 --> 16:06.400
Don't stop it now, darling, show me.

16:06.709 --> 16:09.109
Show me your anger. Show it to me.

16:10.913 --> 16:12.744
Go all the way through it.

16:14.050 --> 16:16.712
Go all the way through it, till the end.

16:18.621 --> 16:19.986
Right to the end.

16:28.364 --> 16:30.229
That one's my favorite.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.829
This one's your favorite?

16:33.002 --> 16:36.165
Yes, Mommy in the hospital
when she was a little girl.

16:39.075 --> 16:41.373
That's right. I remember this picture.

16:42.244 --> 16:44.712
Your Grandpa Barton took this picture.

16:44.814 --> 16:47.977
Tell me the rest of the story
that goes with this picture.

16:48.084 --> 16:50.382
Why was Mommy in the hospital so much?

16:55.458 --> 16:58.894
Some days, she would wake up
and she would be covered...

16:59.495 --> 17:01.258
with big, ugly bumps.

17:02.965 --> 17:06.423
And the doctors were very worried,
because they could never find out...

17:06.535 --> 17:08.833
what those bumps all over her skin
really were.

17:45.141 --> 17:49.373
I guess I didn't stack the dishes too well.
I better go see what the damage is.

17:52.782 --> 17:55.910
While I'm there,
I think I'll freshen up both our drinks.

20:55.831 --> 20:56.798
Jerry.

20:57.633 --> 20:58.691
Hi, Frank.

20:59.134 --> 21:01.466
You're really falling behind on this.

21:01.570 --> 21:05.199
The Brenleys think that they are going to be
moving in here by May.

21:05.507 --> 21:08.806
We're not going to make that, for sure.
Maybe by June.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.075
I heard that the city plumbing permit
got held up...

21:12.181 --> 21:14.342
because of a change in the building code.

21:15.050 --> 21:16.017
Mr. Carveth.

21:16.986 --> 21:18.578
Telephone call for you.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.297
<i>- Hello.
- Is that Mr. Carveth?</i>

21:33.736 --> 21:35.135
<i>- Yes.
- Mr. Frank Carveth?</i>

21:35.237 --> 21:38.536
<i>- This is Frank Carveth.
- This is Sgt. Martel, with 78th Division.</i>

21:38.774 --> 21:41.368
One of our officers noticed
a broken kitchen window...

21:41.477 --> 21:44.105
while on a routine patrol
of the neighborhood.

21:44.213 --> 21:47.011
He found your mother-in-law's body
in the kitchen.

21:47.716 --> 21:50.412
The murder weapon was on the floor,
next to her.

21:50.986 --> 21:54.649
He then found your daughter upstairs,
sound asleep in the bedroom.

21:56.592 --> 21:58.787
It seems she missed the whole thing.

21:59.628 --> 22:03.997
- Where is she now? I'd like to see her.
- With our police psychologist, Dr. Birkin.

22:04.566 --> 22:07.558
- Psychologist? Why? Was she hysterical?
- No.

22:08.771 --> 22:12.434
On the contrary, she was very cool
throughout the whole thing.

22:13.976 --> 22:17.639
A little too cool, I thought,
so I asked Dr. Birkin to talk with her.

22:18.347 --> 22:19.814
Just for an opinion.

22:20.716 --> 22:24.743
In the meantime, can you think of
the names of any persons...

22:25.054 --> 22:27.648
who would have a motive
to murder this woman?

22:27.957 --> 22:32.257
You see, it doesn't seem to me to be
a simple case of an interrupted break-in...

22:33.562 --> 22:35.655
or, say, a rape-murder.

22:38.067 --> 22:41.366
Juliana had a long series of lovers.
I never met any of them.

22:41.971 --> 22:43.632
What about her husband?

22:45.207 --> 22:48.973
His name is Barton Kelly.
He works for the government, out in Halifax.

22:49.912 --> 22:52.142
They were divorced over 10 years ago.

22:57.286 --> 22:59.754
- Dr. Birkin.
- You must be Candice's father.

22:59.955 --> 23:01.582
I'd like to take her home now.

23:01.690 --> 23:05.524
Please. Give me just two minutes with you.
It's important. Have a seat.

23:08.230 --> 23:12.963
To put it bluntly, I don't think your daughter
escaped this incident entirely unscathed.

23:13.068 --> 23:15.935
- You think she saw what happened?
- I suspect she did.

23:16.038 --> 23:19.974
Or she saw something
which traumatized her, confused her...

23:20.509 --> 23:21.908
disturbed her in some way.

23:22.011 --> 23:25.606
The officer who found her
said that she was very difficult to wake up.

23:25.714 --> 23:28.683
To me, that indicates
a kind of abnormal deep sleep...

23:28.784 --> 23:31.776
which a lot of people,
even children, will use...

23:31.887 --> 23:34.617
to escape something
that's too painful to face.

23:34.923 --> 23:38.757
And she says that she doesn't remember
being brought to her grandmother's...

23:38.861 --> 23:40.624
or seeing her at all.

23:41.196 --> 23:43.630
Do you think she'll remember, eventually?

23:44.033 --> 23:47.332
Mr. Carveth, I think you must
encourage her to remember.

23:48.203 --> 23:49.170
Why?

23:49.605 --> 23:52.938
My concern is that the child
could have a very serious breakdown...

23:53.042 --> 23:56.102
if she doesn't come to terms
with what she's experienced.

23:56.211 --> 24:00.307
You see, these things tend to
express themselves in one way or another.

24:01.216 --> 24:03.047
I've seen five-year-olds like her...

24:03.152 --> 24:05.677
with ulcers as bad
as any middle-aged businessman.

24:05.788 --> 24:07.813
Okay, I get the picture.

24:09.291 --> 24:12.021
- Now can I take her home?
- I think that's fine.

24:12.261 --> 24:13.421
No problem.

24:56.071 --> 24:57.868
You're sure you don't want a story?

24:58.774 --> 25:00.799
You don't have to read, you know.

25:01.276 --> 25:03.005
I can make one up for you.

25:06.315 --> 25:08.647
Do you want to tell me a story...

25:09.017 --> 25:11.349
about what happened today at Grandma's?

25:18.093 --> 25:19.651
You go to sleep, honey.

25:21.230 --> 25:23.130
I'll leave the hall light on.

25:36.211 --> 25:37.178
Damn.

25:40.883 --> 25:43.977
No outside calls. You're in isolation.
You know that.

25:44.086 --> 25:46.816
I tried to reach Dr. Raglan. He hasn't come.

25:46.922 --> 25:48.321
He's on his way.

25:50.125 --> 25:51.092
Chris...

25:54.363 --> 25:56.627
Is something wrong? Anything?

25:58.934 --> 26:00.868
Then it's me again.

26:03.272 --> 26:05.399
Nothing's wrong, except with me.

26:06.175 --> 26:10.043
No, that's Frank talking,
Frank twisting my words.

26:11.713 --> 26:15.672
He won't be patient, he won't trust me,
he won't wait until I get well.

26:17.186 --> 26:18.448
He thinks...

26:19.788 --> 26:21.585
that I'm turning into my mother.

26:21.690 --> 26:24.784
Day by day, moment by moment,
he thinks that I'm trying...

26:24.960 --> 26:27.485
to make Candy into Baby Nola.

26:27.863 --> 26:29.125
Is he right?

26:31.700 --> 26:35.192
No. That's the last thing on earth I'd...

26:42.110 --> 26:43.202
Who's that?

26:49.384 --> 26:50.476
It's Daddy.

26:52.521 --> 26:55.684
Frank hates me, Daddy. He despises me.

26:57.759 --> 27:00.023
He thinks I'm trying to harm my little girl...

27:00.128 --> 27:03.222
and I know that he's thinking of a way
to take her away.

27:03.999 --> 27:07.127
And that's very unfair of him.
That's very arrogant of him.

27:07.236 --> 27:09.932
You mustn't be too hard on him,
Nola, sweetheart.

27:10.138 --> 27:12.902
He's just trying to be a good,
protective father.

27:14.209 --> 27:15.233
No.

27:15.711 --> 27:16.769
Yes.

27:17.179 --> 27:19.977
He's just doing
what a good father should do.

27:20.215 --> 27:22.183
He's protecting his little girl.

27:22.851 --> 27:26.514
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
He doesn't want to see her hurt.

27:26.622 --> 27:30.114
He doesn't want to see her hurt by anybody,
not even her own mother.

27:30.225 --> 27:33.126
Now, is there anything wrong with that?

27:35.264 --> 27:36.231
No.

27:38.166 --> 27:39.929
No, there isn't.

27:44.072 --> 27:46.905
After all, it's just what I did for you, isn't it?

27:49.177 --> 27:52.840
Frank's protecting Candy
the same way as I protected you, isn't he?

27:54.216 --> 27:55.183
Isn't he?

27:56.752 --> 27:57.719
No.

28:01.790 --> 28:03.348
What do you mean, "no"?

28:04.459 --> 28:06.984
- What do mean when you say "no"?
- I love you, Daddy.

28:10.365 --> 28:13.061
I don't want you to think
that I don't love you.

28:14.403 --> 28:15.995
I mean, you didn't.

28:17.773 --> 28:18.797
"Didn't"?

28:20.108 --> 28:21.268
"Didn't" what?

28:24.179 --> 28:25.737
You didn't protect me.

28:26.648 --> 28:27.740
You didn't.

28:29.818 --> 28:31.809
You didn't, and you should have.

28:38.927 --> 28:41.828
You shouldn't have looked away
when she hit me.

28:46.802 --> 28:49.270
And you shouldn't have walked away
from the table...

28:49.371 --> 28:52.898
when she twisted my words.
You should have stopped her.

28:58.380 --> 29:00.644
You should have hit her when she hit me!

29:00.749 --> 29:03.741
And you should have smacked her
when she smacked me.

29:03.852 --> 29:05.615
Oh, God, I love you.

29:10.258 --> 29:11.987
But you didn't protect me.

29:12.728 --> 29:14.195
And you should have.

29:14.763 --> 29:17.061
You pretended it wasn't happening.

29:17.265 --> 29:18.459
You looked away.

29:21.470 --> 29:22.903
And you should have.

29:24.573 --> 29:25.938
Why didn't you?

29:31.113 --> 29:32.603
Didn't you love me?

30:15.824 --> 30:17.291
Look, there he is.

30:18.093 --> 30:19.890
There's your grandfather.

30:20.796 --> 30:21.922
Barton.

30:22.664 --> 30:25.258
Hello, Frank. How you doing?
Good to see you.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.267
- Let me take that.
- Hello. How you doing, Candy?

30:28.537 --> 30:31.301
I guess you don't remember
your old granddad?

30:32.908 --> 30:34.307
Right this way.

30:34.609 --> 30:38.306
You didn't have to come way out here.
We could have met later, at the hotel.

30:38.413 --> 30:40.904
I just didn't like the idea
of you coming in alone.

30:41.016 --> 30:42.711
How long you plan to stay in town?

30:42.818 --> 30:45.446
I guess we could
have the funeral tomorrow...

30:45.720 --> 30:48.484
but Juliana's parents
might want to come in from Arizona.

30:48.590 --> 30:52.617
Then there's that sister in Vancouver.
I don't know just how it's going to work out.

30:52.727 --> 30:55.753
- All right. What hotel are you staying in?
- Park Plaza.

30:56.364 --> 30:59.993
You know, I was even thinking
about going out to that old house again.

31:00.368 --> 31:02.859
I still have the key, after all these years.

31:03.305 --> 31:07.241
Juliana used to make a big fuss
about never having changed the locks.

31:07.709 --> 31:09.700
I could never understand why.

31:10.145 --> 31:13.774
Maybe it's because she really couldn't admit
that we were finished.

31:15.050 --> 31:17.450
When I think about you and Nola...

31:18.153 --> 31:22.112
and this sweet child having to go through
the same heartaches we went through...

31:22.224 --> 31:24.021
it's enough to make you cry.

31:25.794 --> 31:27.125
Yes, it is.

32:07.302 --> 32:10.601
I'm here to see Mr. Jan Hartog.

32:28.523 --> 32:30.821
Come in. Right in.

32:38.033 --> 32:40.797
Sit down. I'll be right there.

32:45.607 --> 32:47.768
Sit down. I'll be there in a second.

32:50.979 --> 32:53.243
Goddamn son of a bitch.

33:00.322 --> 33:01.516
Okay.

33:17.339 --> 33:18.636
That's my...

33:19.608 --> 33:21.508
heart, over there on the floor.

33:22.143 --> 33:24.270
- Your heart?
- My second heart.

33:25.480 --> 33:29.473
Your first heart
makes your blood circulate, right?

33:30.552 --> 33:32.782
But what about your lymphatic fluids?

33:34.089 --> 33:35.283
I don't know.

33:35.690 --> 33:39.888
Movement, walking and running, fucking,
rolling on the floor, anything.

33:40.495 --> 33:44.022
People have this whole other system
they don't even know about.

33:44.199 --> 33:47.657
The lymphatic system,
it's like the blood system...

33:47.769 --> 33:51.705
with its own style of veins and arteries...

33:52.474 --> 33:53.771
but no heart.

33:54.743 --> 33:57.405
You have to keep moving
to get it to circulate.

33:58.446 --> 34:03.213
And they've just given me pills.
They do that every day.

34:05.053 --> 34:08.545
And I've got to move them
through the lymphatic system.

34:10.625 --> 34:12.820
Goddamn it.

34:18.833 --> 34:20.322
Pardon my sweat.

34:21.136 --> 34:23.434
I'm gonna take a bath, real soon.

34:24.873 --> 34:28.934
So, Mr. Carveth...

34:29.444 --> 34:30.809
how did you get my name?

34:30.911 --> 34:33.039
My lawyer knows your lawyer.

34:33.148 --> 34:35.013
I see. I get it.

34:35.116 --> 34:38.608
Is your lawyer
preparing a case against Raglan, too?

34:39.387 --> 34:40.684
Basically, yes.

34:41.356 --> 34:44.688
- Slightly different from yours.
- How different?

34:46.293 --> 34:48.762
My wife is still in therapy with Raglan.

34:49.931 --> 34:54.094
I'm claiming psychological damage,
not physiological.

34:54.703 --> 34:57.501
I see. Give him some more time
with your wife...

34:58.006 --> 35:01.066
and you'll be able to claim
physiological damage, too.

35:03.011 --> 35:05.309
Wouldn't this look impressive in court?

35:08.750 --> 35:10.274
Do you like it? I do.

35:11.619 --> 35:15.180
That's Raglan. That's psychoplasmics...

35:15.557 --> 35:18.117
and it's called lymphosarcoma.

35:19.094 --> 35:21.062
And it's spreading.

35:22.530 --> 35:25.124
It's a form of cancer
of the lymphatic system.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.563
You blame Raglan for that?

35:28.737 --> 35:30.170
Raglan did it.

35:32.006 --> 35:34.804
Raglan encouraged my body...

35:36.211 --> 35:38.304
to revolt against me.

35:39.447 --> 35:40.607
And it did.

35:41.015 --> 35:44.746
I have a small revolution on my hands...

35:45.386 --> 35:48.082
and I'm not putting it down
very successfully.

35:48.790 --> 35:52.351
Then your lawyer really thinks
he can prove Raglan's responsible?

35:52.560 --> 35:55.927
Are you kidding me?
You can't prove something like that in court.

35:56.030 --> 35:59.591
Right from square one,
you're into, what, metaphysics?

36:02.604 --> 36:05.198
How do you know
I'm not going to get cancer at age 32...

36:05.306 --> 36:08.833
whether I'd gone into
psychoplasmics therapy or not?

36:09.844 --> 36:12.642
No, we'd get laughed out of court.

36:13.581 --> 36:16.015
Then why are you going into court?

36:17.118 --> 36:18.415
Revenge.

36:22.957 --> 36:26.552
Even if we lose, people will get nervous
about psychoplasmics.

36:26.661 --> 36:28.891
It will be bad publicity.

36:31.099 --> 36:33.659
They won't even remember
whether we won or lost.

36:33.768 --> 36:35.963
They'll just remember the slogan:

36:36.738 --> 36:40.265
"Psychoplasmics can cause cancer."

36:41.176 --> 36:42.473
Catchy.

36:45.580 --> 36:47.309
Is that going to help?

36:51.419 --> 36:52.386
Maybe.

36:53.221 --> 36:54.313
I'm not alone.

36:54.422 --> 36:57.983
I'm in touch with a lot of people
who did psychoplasmics.

36:59.994 --> 37:01.689
We might form a club.

37:04.866 --> 37:07.027
I want to help you.

37:09.337 --> 37:10.929
Okay. Thanks.

37:31.326 --> 37:32.588
Dr. Raglan?

37:35.496 --> 37:36.463
Yes?

37:36.898 --> 37:39.924
I'm Barton Kelly, Nola Carveth's father.

37:41.135 --> 37:42.466
Glad to meet you.

37:42.570 --> 37:45.403
I'm sorry to accost you like this...

37:45.506 --> 37:48.339
but your receptionist wasn't too helpful.

37:48.843 --> 37:51.243
She probably knew I was on my way to...

37:51.346 --> 37:54.338
Did you know
that Nola's mother died yesterday?

37:54.449 --> 37:55.916
That she was murdered?

37:56.117 --> 37:58.176
Yes, the police spoke to me.

37:58.753 --> 38:01.517
- Then you've told her.
- No, I haven't.

38:02.891 --> 38:05.792
That's why I'm here, to tell her.

38:06.394 --> 38:09.830
Mr. Kelly, your wife's death
was a tragic and shocking thing.

38:10.231 --> 38:12.461
That's why Nola must not be told.

38:13.968 --> 38:14.935
What?

38:15.803 --> 38:19.000
Nola's going through a very critical stage
in her therapy.

38:19.274 --> 38:21.208
I'm not sure she could take it.

38:22.410 --> 38:25.607
Are you saying that
I'm just supposed to bury the girl's mother...

38:25.713 --> 38:27.408
and not tell her about it?

38:27.649 --> 38:29.583
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

38:31.386 --> 38:35.914
You are one ignorant son of a bitch,
Dr. Raglan.

38:41.129 --> 38:43.256
Now, I have left my phone number...

38:44.165 --> 38:45.757
on your front desk.

38:46.901 --> 38:50.132
If I don't hear from my daughter
by tomorrow afternoon...

38:51.806 --> 38:53.933
I'm coming back up here to get her.

38:59.948 --> 39:01.643
Shall I have him stopped?

39:02.350 --> 39:03.783
No, it's all right.

39:04.519 --> 39:05.611
He's drunk.

39:48.096 --> 39:50.064
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

39:51.532 --> 39:54.194
- You two look like you're having fun.
- We were.

39:55.203 --> 39:57.899
Daddy, Ms. Mayer said she was starving.

39:58.106 --> 40:00.438
Can we feed her at our place tonight?

40:00.541 --> 40:01.508
Candy...

40:02.343 --> 40:04.004
We could if she wanted to.

40:06.214 --> 40:07.579
What do you think?

40:08.182 --> 40:09.308
Well, I...

40:09.917 --> 40:12.181
We could talk after Candy goes to bed.

40:14.789 --> 40:15.756
Sure.

40:22.397 --> 40:24.957
As soon as Candy realized
she had me alone...

40:25.066 --> 40:27.762
she got me to play
"mother and daughter" with her.

40:30.038 --> 40:32.836
She obviously needs mothering,
and isn't getting it.

40:36.144 --> 40:40.308
Sometimes it just kills me to think
I might have screwed my kid up already.

40:40.715 --> 40:42.410
She's not even six.

40:43.151 --> 40:44.641
It's not just you.

40:46.788 --> 40:50.053
Sometimes when I'm being easy on myself,
I say, "It's not your fault.

40:50.158 --> 40:51.625
"You got taken in.

40:52.193 --> 40:55.219
"You got involved with a woman
who married you for your sanity...

40:55.329 --> 40:57.024
"hoping it would rub off."

40:59.133 --> 41:01.601
Instead, it started to work the other way.

41:10.978 --> 41:11.945
Hello?

41:12.246 --> 41:13.941
<i>It's Barton Kelly, Frank.</i>

41:14.315 --> 41:15.509
<i>How are you?</i>

41:15.950 --> 41:17.008
Just mediocre.

41:17.718 --> 41:18.844
<i>How are you?</i>

41:20.455 --> 41:22.116
I made a mistake.

41:22.924 --> 41:24.789
I came back to the old place.

41:25.927 --> 41:27.292
It's got me.

41:29.363 --> 41:31.126
I'm depressed as hell.

41:32.166 --> 41:34.498
Barton, get in a cab, will you?

41:35.103 --> 41:37.435
<i>- Just tell him to take...
- That's not all.</i>

41:38.272 --> 41:39.637
<i>There's Nola, too.</i>

41:42.410 --> 41:43.342
How do you mean?

41:43.878 --> 41:46.005
I went up to that place to see her.

41:47.248 --> 41:49.182
They wouldn't even let me talk to her.

41:50.318 --> 41:52.786
<i>They said no to me, her own father!</i>

41:52.887 --> 41:53.854
Jesus.

41:54.288 --> 41:56.882
So I'm going back up there, to Somafree.

41:57.625 --> 42:00.185
<i>We'll leave just as soon as you get here.</i>

42:00.294 --> 42:01.352
Soon as I get there?

42:01.462 --> 42:03.123
I'll be waiting for you.

42:03.231 --> 42:05.495
I know you'll want to go up there with me.

42:06.267 --> 42:09.327
<i>- You're not far from here, are you?
- Barton, listen to me.</i>

42:09.437 --> 42:12.065
<i>I don't think that's a very smart thing to do.</i>

42:12.173 --> 42:14.971
I'm doing it, with or without you.

42:16.878 --> 42:18.004
Okay.

42:18.579 --> 42:21.207
I'm only about 15 minutes away. Wait for me.

42:21.315 --> 42:22.543
I'll be there.

42:23.151 --> 42:24.812
You're a good lad.

42:27.021 --> 42:29.785
We'll go up there together,
and kick their ass.

42:31.392 --> 42:33.155
I'm waiting on you.

42:39.433 --> 42:42.300
I've a feeling
I've just been recruited to baby-sit.

42:43.337 --> 42:45.931
Would you? Lt'd take 45 minutes.

42:46.707 --> 42:47.901
He's drunk.

42:48.009 --> 42:51.536
He'll drive his car off a bridge,
unless I talk some sense into him.

42:51.646 --> 42:52.908
45 minutes?

42:53.014 --> 42:54.572
That's all it'll take.

42:55.049 --> 42:56.016
Okay.

42:56.384 --> 42:57.351
Thanks.

42:58.386 --> 43:00.286
Help yourself to some coffee.

43:01.522 --> 43:02.489
Here.

43:04.258 --> 43:06.055
Look at this while I'm gone.

43:06.327 --> 43:08.488
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

43:08.629 --> 43:09.960
45 minutes.

46:07.975 --> 46:09.840
I shouldn't have...

46:12.380 --> 46:15.110
I never planned it to be this way.

47:09.937 --> 47:10.904
Nola?

47:44.338 --> 47:45.305
Barton!

47:47.842 --> 47:48.809
It's me!

49:36.350 --> 49:37.874
I can't get over it.

49:38.018 --> 49:39.576
The thing was in the house.

49:39.687 --> 49:42.349
It was in the house all the time.
We searched the place...

49:42.456 --> 49:45.482
but we weren't looking
for anything that small, and we missed it.

49:45.593 --> 49:48.926
We were spending our time
checking out an Estonian musician.

49:49.263 --> 49:51.561
Have you found out who it belongs to,
the kid?

49:51.665 --> 49:53.292
No. My guess is...

49:53.400 --> 49:57.029
some crazy woman didn't want
anyone to know she had a deformed child.

49:57.137 --> 50:01.005
She's locked this kid up in an attic
for years and never told anybody.

50:01.642 --> 50:03.473
Wouldn't be the first time.

50:08.482 --> 50:09.449
Hello.

50:11.852 --> 50:13.080
<i>Who's this?</i>

50:13.754 --> 50:14.914
Ruth Mayer.

50:15.089 --> 50:16.886
Did you want to speak with Frank Carveth?

50:16.991 --> 50:20.358
<i>Ruth Mayer? From Krell Street School?</i>

50:20.494 --> 50:21.461
Yes.

50:22.062 --> 50:23.393
Is this Mrs. Carveth?

50:23.497 --> 50:28.196
<i>Are you and my husband
having your own private PTA meeting?</i>

50:28.802 --> 50:31.066
I won't even bother to answer that.

50:31.872 --> 50:33.362
<i>You bitch!</i>

50:33.774 --> 50:35.605
<i>You're killing my family!</i>

51:07.408 --> 51:10.241
<i>Our friend has very strange eyes.</i>

51:10.811 --> 51:12.870
They have irises, but no retinas.

51:13.814 --> 51:16.783
I should think his vision of the world
is very distorted.

51:16.917 --> 51:19.852
I'm pretty certain he sees things
only in black-and-white.

51:19.953 --> 51:21.011
No colors.

51:21.655 --> 51:23.520
The upper lip is cleft.

51:24.024 --> 51:25.514
Real harelip...

51:25.893 --> 51:27.554
but the palate is not.

51:28.195 --> 51:31.426
And the tongue is too thick and inflexible
for proper speech.

51:32.399 --> 51:33.764
It has no teeth...

51:34.334 --> 51:36.495
but you can get a pretty nasty bite...

51:36.603 --> 51:38.833
<i>from these strange, beak-like gums.</i>

51:39.840 --> 51:41.137
<i>Why did it die?</i>

51:41.508 --> 51:45.137
<i>I found some sort of collapsed, fleshy sac...</i>

51:45.245 --> 51:47.611
<i>between the little fellow's shoulder blades.</i>

51:48.582 --> 51:51.312
It contains traces
of a solid nutrient material...

51:51.418 --> 51:54.353
a bit like the yolk sac of certain fish...

51:55.255 --> 51:56.552
or a camel's hump.

51:57.491 --> 52:00.927
Basically, it's a gas tank
that was full at birth.

52:01.662 --> 52:04.722
Once the hump material
is completely assimilated...

52:05.099 --> 52:07.693
I think the creature simply starves to death.

52:08.168 --> 52:10.261
Runs out of gas, so to speak.

52:11.772 --> 52:14.639
<i>And that brings us
to the last point of interest.</i>

52:15.609 --> 52:17.804
<i>There's an external deformity.</i>

52:18.779 --> 52:21.976
I mean, apart from the lack of sexual organs.

52:22.883 --> 52:27.047
It's extremely subtle
and extremely provocative.

52:29.089 --> 52:31.557
I wonder if either of you have noticed it.

52:32.192 --> 52:34.057
- Has no navel.
- No what?

52:34.895 --> 52:36.157
No bellybutton.

52:37.364 --> 52:40.231
- The thing has no bellybutton.
- That's right.

52:40.367 --> 52:44.599
And that means this creature
has never really been born.

52:45.072 --> 52:47.666
At least, not the way
human beings are born.

52:48.041 --> 52:49.008
Jesus.

52:58.218 --> 53:00.846
You're the beginning of the end, Ms. Mayer.

53:01.755 --> 53:05.213
The beginning of the end for me,
my family, my dream.

53:06.093 --> 53:07.060
So sad.

53:09.029 --> 53:13.193
And I feel so guilty for my part in it.
I wish it had never happened.

53:14.668 --> 53:18.331
I wish we could be together again,
just the three of us.

53:19.740 --> 53:21.503
You're kidding yourself.

53:22.643 --> 53:24.577
Right now, you're dreaming.

53:24.845 --> 53:27.541
From what Frank tells me,
it was lousy from the very start.

53:27.648 --> 53:29.843
You never had anything real together.

53:30.918 --> 53:33.284
It would be better for everybody if you...

53:33.387 --> 53:35.617
If Frank divorced you and married me.

53:36.790 --> 53:39.486
We'd still let you see Candy
in the weekends.

53:41.261 --> 53:42.489
That stinks!

53:46.166 --> 53:47.133
We had a lot.

53:47.234 --> 53:50.795
We had beautiful things,
things that you couldn't understand.

53:50.904 --> 53:54.499
And we'll have them again,
if you'd just leave him alone...

53:55.075 --> 53:59.637
and stop poisoning him against me
and taking advantage of his loneliness.

54:03.050 --> 54:04.813
Then he'd wait for me.

54:06.320 --> 54:09.221
He'd help me to get better,
instead of abandoning me.

54:10.691 --> 54:14.218
He would do that,
if you would just leave him alone.

54:19.633 --> 54:21.100
Leave him alone!

54:34.982 --> 54:37.815
Listen, I'm sorry. I called a few times.
You didn't answer.

54:37.918 --> 54:41.251
I didn't want to talk to your wife again,
that's why. Once was enough.

54:41.355 --> 54:44.222
- Nola called? What did she say?
- Look, I have to go.

54:48.362 --> 54:51.695
Your life is just a little too complicated
for me right now.

54:53.066 --> 54:55.193
I'll see you at the next open house.

55:57.130 --> 55:58.188
Daddy.

56:03.103 --> 56:05.594
What's the matter, sweetheart?
Why aren't you sleeping?

56:05.706 --> 56:08.698
I had a bad dream. A scary bad dream.

56:09.276 --> 56:12.871
- What was the dream about, honey?
- I'm afraid to tell you.

56:13.480 --> 56:16.210
- Why?
- The dream doesn't want me to.

56:17.050 --> 56:18.540
Candy, listen to me.

56:19.252 --> 56:22.585
I know what happened at Grandma's.
I know what you saw there.

56:22.889 --> 56:24.823
I just came from the police...

56:24.925 --> 56:27.951
and when I was there,
I saw the thing that hurt Grandma.

56:28.895 --> 56:31.523
And, Candy, it's dead.

56:32.699 --> 56:36.726
I saw it lying on a table,
and the police were there, and it's dead.

56:38.839 --> 56:40.397
It can't hurt you now.

56:42.109 --> 56:44.976
And it can't hurt me or anybody else.

56:46.380 --> 56:47.972
Do you understand me?

56:48.949 --> 56:50.075
It's dead?

56:51.018 --> 56:52.042
Yes.

57:02.195 --> 57:04.993
It's all right now, baby.

57:15.976 --> 57:17.341
What do you think?

57:18.345 --> 57:21.109
How many people do we have
at the main house?

57:21.415 --> 57:22.575
Twenty-seven.

57:23.984 --> 57:26.452
Okay, I want them out by this afternoon...

57:27.187 --> 57:28.745
and the house closed.

57:30.857 --> 57:33.485
It'll be hard on them, Hal, especially Mike.

57:34.594 --> 57:36.027
Then do it gently.

57:37.364 --> 57:38.695
But get them out.

57:41.001 --> 57:42.229
All right.

58:06.026 --> 58:09.985
- Put your suitcases in the compartment.
- I don't want to go.

58:10.097 --> 58:13.362
You have to go.
Come on. I just want you to get on the bus...

58:13.567 --> 58:15.228
You'll see the doctor.

58:16.036 --> 58:17.867
I don't want to go.

58:20.774 --> 58:23.470
- Don't make me leave.
- I'm not making you leave.

58:24.077 --> 58:26.807
Just be a good boy
and get on the bus, all right?

58:37.290 --> 58:39.224
- Hi, Jan.
- Frank, hi.

58:39.993 --> 58:43.258
Look, I think we've got ourselves
a real live one.

58:44.164 --> 58:47.190
Come on upstairs.
There's somebody I want you to meet.

58:53.974 --> 58:55.839
Is this the guy from Chicago?

58:56.643 --> 58:59.373
No. He's a local boy.

58:59.846 --> 59:02.246
He lives a lot closer to home
than you expected.

59:25.172 --> 59:27.231
Mr. Carveth is here to see you.

59:28.975 --> 59:30.101
Look who's here.

59:31.545 --> 59:32.944
Nola's old man.

59:34.514 --> 59:38.245
- The queen bee's favorite drone.
- Jeez, he's pretty far gone.

59:38.685 --> 59:39.913
He'd be dynamite in court.

59:43.790 --> 59:46.850
What did you mean when you said
Nola's the queen bee?

59:47.594 --> 59:51.155
She's the queen bee, all right.
She's the star.

59:51.798 --> 59:56.064
She's the one he's interested in,
and the rest of us don't count anymore.

59:56.736 --> 59:59.136
She doesn't even have to pay for it.

01:00:00.106 --> 01:00:03.269
That's because she's the one
who was born to prove...

01:00:03.543 --> 01:00:07.843
that "psychoplasmics
is the ultimate therapeutic device."

01:00:08.081 --> 01:00:10.015
That's the quote, isn't it?

01:00:12.619 --> 01:00:15.281
Can you be my daddy?
He won't do it anymore.

01:00:15.555 --> 01:00:17.546
And my real daddy won't do it.

01:00:17.757 --> 01:00:20.885
And that bastard, Dr. Raglan,
won't do it anymore.

01:00:21.461 --> 01:00:23.929
You see, my real daddy rejected me.

01:00:26.533 --> 01:00:29.229
And my surrogate daddy rejected me.

01:00:29.336 --> 01:00:31.702
That's just fucking wonderful,
don't you think?

01:00:31.805 --> 01:00:35.434
Calm down, Mike. Cool it,
and tell him what happened at Somafree.

01:00:36.843 --> 01:00:37.969
Look...

01:00:40.814 --> 01:00:42.839
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:46.552
Just be my daddy.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.455
Please. I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

01:00:50.724 --> 01:00:53.249
I'll bleed for you. Want me to bleed?

01:00:54.461 --> 01:00:55.450
No.

01:00:55.562 --> 01:00:59.464
That's silly, right?
Repulses you, I can see that.

01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:03.063
You're not into it, so why do it, right?

01:01:04.738 --> 01:01:08.174
Besides, nobody could do it like Dr. Raglan.

01:01:09.442 --> 01:01:10.909
Not even real daddy.

01:01:12.712 --> 01:01:14.111
And he knows it.

01:01:15.615 --> 01:01:18.812
Dr. Raglan knows I'm addicted to him...

01:01:19.119 --> 01:01:20.848
and he doesn't care.

01:01:21.955 --> 01:01:23.786
He's such a hard man.

01:01:26.026 --> 01:01:28.392
I was at that demonstration last Monday.

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:33.665
You and Raglan seemed very close.
What happened?

01:01:35.268 --> 01:01:37.566
He threw us out. All of us.

01:01:38.538 --> 01:01:39.835
Locked the door.

01:01:41.574 --> 01:01:44.975
It's true.
I've been in touch with some of the others.

01:01:45.312 --> 01:01:49.214
They've all been thrown out of Somafree,
and all therapy suspended.

01:01:49.916 --> 01:01:53.010
All except for your wife. She's still there.

01:01:56.623 --> 01:01:58.318
Doesn't anybody know why?

01:01:58.992 --> 01:02:03.053
Sure somebody knows. I know.
He wants to be alone with her.

01:02:03.196 --> 01:02:05.790
Dr. Raglan wants to be alone with your wife.

01:03:08.528 --> 01:03:10.393
- 'Bye, Daddy.
- 'Bye.

01:03:49.035 --> 01:03:51.196
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi, Wendy.

01:03:56.676 --> 01:03:58.974
Quickly but quietly, children.

01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:23.628
Rebecca, do you want to pass out
the blue papers, please?

01:04:23.736 --> 01:04:26.671
And Clayton, how about you pass out
the purple ones?

01:04:29.476 --> 01:04:30.704
Okay, let's see.

01:04:46.392 --> 01:04:47.518
This person here?

01:05:01.608 --> 01:05:04.099
You can do snowflakes, too.
That's a good idea.

01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:45.110
Help!

01:05:46.052 --> 01:05:48.885
- What's the matter?
- They're hurting Ms. Mayer.

01:05:49.022 --> 01:05:50.819
The bad kids are hurting Ms. Mayer.

01:05:50.924 --> 01:05:53.358
They knocked her to the floor
and they're hitting her.

01:05:53.459 --> 01:05:56.326
They're hitting Ms. Mayer.
They made her fall down!

01:06:46.479 --> 01:06:47.639
Candy!

01:07:04.263 --> 01:07:05.992
It's all right. It's Hal.

01:07:10.637 --> 01:07:13.128
Where's Chris? Chris usually wakes me up.

01:07:13.473 --> 01:07:15.532
Chris had to go into the city.

01:07:16.743 --> 01:07:18.267
You've been dreaming?

01:07:20.113 --> 01:07:22.547
Yes. I was having a wonderful dream.

01:07:22.815 --> 01:07:23.975
Wonderful.

01:07:25.485 --> 01:07:27.476
And painful, at the same time.

01:07:28.554 --> 01:07:30.681
My daughter was coming back to me.

01:07:31.724 --> 01:07:32.816
And Frank.

01:07:33.826 --> 01:07:35.123
And Ruth Mayer?

01:07:36.262 --> 01:07:38.059
Was she in your dream?

01:07:39.999 --> 01:07:41.466
Candy's teacher?

01:07:42.268 --> 01:07:43.735
I don't remember.

01:07:46.339 --> 01:07:48.637
Then maybe we should talk about her.

01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:53.070
But I don't feel the need to talk about her.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.206
You don't?

01:07:56.249 --> 01:07:57.307
Why not?

01:08:00.153 --> 01:08:01.677
I don't know.

01:08:04.157 --> 01:08:07.615
I think I must be getting stronger,
because somehow...

01:08:08.594 --> 01:08:11.154
I just don't feel threatened by her anymore.

01:08:44.796 --> 01:08:47.630
This is where my wife and kid lived
for nine months...

01:08:47.734 --> 01:08:49.759
before Nola moved out to Somafree.

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.261
This is the first time I've seen the place.

01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:59.002
What are we doing here?

01:08:59.545 --> 01:09:00.773
Tell me, again.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.546
I don't know.

01:09:05.151 --> 01:09:07.517
I thought Candy might come back here.

01:09:18.765 --> 01:09:20.528
It's not a coincidence.

01:09:21.801 --> 01:09:23.996
Those things, those creatures...

01:09:25.238 --> 01:09:27.138
they all disappeared together.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.238
They've got her.

01:10:51.057 --> 01:10:53.355
You've got to help me.
Somebody's following me.

01:10:53.459 --> 01:10:56.292
- Somebody's always following me.
- Did you find out anything?

01:10:56.395 --> 01:11:01.025
- Did you find out why they moved you out?
- I've got to have something to eat. Anything.

01:11:01.467 --> 01:11:05.062
What did you find out?
Why did they close Somafree down?

01:11:05.605 --> 01:11:07.903
- Talk to me! Now!
- Okay.

01:11:08.441 --> 01:11:12.343
Raglan's onto something very big,
something to do with the kids.

01:11:12.645 --> 01:11:15.910
- He just got bored with the rest of us.
- Kids? What kids?

01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:19.750
The disturbed kids in the work shed...

01:11:20.386 --> 01:11:22.547
the ones your wife's taking care of.

01:13:33.285 --> 01:13:35.253
What have you done with my kid?

01:13:35.688 --> 01:13:37.178
Where is she?

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.285
Carveth, what the hell
are you talking about?

01:13:45.231 --> 01:13:46.493
They took her.

01:13:46.966 --> 01:13:50.697
They killed Ruth Mayer,
and then they brought Candice back here.

01:14:05.885 --> 01:14:07.477
They killed Ruth Mayer?

01:14:09.221 --> 01:14:12.452
I want my daughter back, now.

01:14:13.759 --> 01:14:16.489
Did they bring her back here, back to Nola?

01:14:17.163 --> 01:14:18.357
I don't know.

01:14:19.098 --> 01:14:23.091
If they brought her back here,
then she'd be up there, in the attic.

01:14:24.537 --> 01:14:26.129
That's where they live.

01:14:33.979 --> 01:14:35.970
Frank, I've got a gun.

01:14:39.218 --> 01:14:42.847
They'll kill you
if you try to take her away from them.

01:14:46.025 --> 01:14:46.992
Why?

01:14:48.928 --> 01:14:51.419
Because they understand
that she's one of them.

01:14:53.032 --> 01:14:54.260
You're insane.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.727
Frank, they exist. You've seen them.

01:14:58.370 --> 01:15:01.567
They're just freaks. Deformed children.

01:15:03.008 --> 01:15:04.532
You've got Nola taking care of them.

01:15:04.643 --> 01:15:07.737
I'm sure she loves being
their surrogate mother.

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:10.312
She's not their surrogate mother.

01:15:11.517 --> 01:15:13.314
She's their real mother.

01:15:14.353 --> 01:15:15.718
Their only mother.

01:15:18.023 --> 01:15:21.186
- I'm not gonna listen.
- They're her children.

01:15:22.328 --> 01:15:25.024
More exactly,
they're the children of her rage.

01:15:25.197 --> 01:15:28.064
They're motivated only by her anger,
whether that anger...

01:15:28.167 --> 01:15:30.158
is conscious or subconscious.

01:15:30.903 --> 01:15:34.634
I mean, when Nola got cross with Candy
last weekend...

01:15:35.174 --> 01:15:36.539
annoyed, really...

01:15:37.176 --> 01:15:38.609
the brood beat her.

01:15:39.545 --> 01:15:43.345
But when she released her rage
against her parents, under therapy...

01:15:44.517 --> 01:15:46.144
then they killed them.

01:15:47.052 --> 01:15:49.486
I know, I didn't want to believe that...

01:15:50.089 --> 01:15:51.920
but now they've killed Ruth Mayer...

01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:55.720
and they could kill you or me,
and she wouldn't even be aware of it.

01:15:56.829 --> 01:15:59.559
I mean, she doesn't even know
that Candy's here.

01:16:02.902 --> 01:16:05.598
- I want Candice back.
- Then do it my way.

01:16:06.872 --> 01:16:07.839
Please.

01:16:08.807 --> 01:16:10.240
It's the right way.

01:16:12.745 --> 01:16:14.440
What do you want me to do?

01:16:15.347 --> 01:16:17.611
I want you to go back into that hut...

01:16:17.917 --> 01:16:20.408
and persuade Nola that you want her back...

01:16:21.453 --> 01:16:23.421
that you want your family back.

01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:27.181
I want you to play the role
of apologetic lover and husband.

01:16:27.793 --> 01:16:28.782
Why?

01:16:29.094 --> 01:16:31.688
Because if you can keep Nola
calm and happy...

01:16:32.097 --> 01:16:33.928
then the brood's neutral.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:38.092
If she's mellow,
then I can just walk into that attic...

01:16:39.171 --> 01:16:41.969
pick up Candy,
tuck her under my arm and walk out.

01:16:42.942 --> 01:16:44.432
Now, can you do that?

01:16:47.846 --> 01:16:49.108
I don't know.

01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:52.014
Frank, if things go wrong...

01:16:53.118 --> 01:16:55.780
if Nola gets angry, if the kids get angry...

01:16:58.324 --> 01:16:59.791
You understand?

01:17:00.759 --> 01:17:03.785
I'm not going to be the only one
to pay for that anger.

01:17:04.129 --> 01:17:05.858
Raglan, I don't trust you.

01:17:09.201 --> 01:17:10.998
What does it matter?

01:17:12.438 --> 01:17:15.100
I'll move up there 30 seconds after you're in.

01:17:24.717 --> 01:17:26.582
Frank, be nice to her.

01:18:03.055 --> 01:18:04.113
Hal?

01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:09.219
It's me, Nola. It's Frank.

01:18:15.301 --> 01:18:16.529
Am I dreaming?

01:18:17.803 --> 01:18:21.739
I thought you said you weren't going to
come and see me while I was here.

01:18:24.777 --> 01:18:26.938
I think that was a misunderstanding.

01:18:32.384 --> 01:18:33.874
That's why I'm here.

01:18:35.888 --> 01:18:38.015
I want us to understand each other.

01:19:20.466 --> 01:19:22.934
You're the only woman in the world for me.

01:19:23.268 --> 01:19:25.759
You always have been, you always will be.

01:19:27.773 --> 01:19:29.400
It won't ever change.

01:19:30.843 --> 01:19:32.504
I want you to know that.

01:19:33.011 --> 01:19:36.071
I wish it were true. God, I wish it were true.

01:20:06.311 --> 01:20:07.539
We lost touch.

01:20:09.348 --> 01:20:11.942
That's the only reason
all this ever happened.

01:20:12.951 --> 01:20:16.409
All we have to do
is make sure we don't lose touch again.

01:20:18.557 --> 01:20:21.048
Isolation is part of my therapy.

01:20:23.128 --> 01:20:26.461
What's been happening to me
has been just too strange...

01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:30.999
too strange for me to share
with anyone from my old life.

01:20:33.338 --> 01:20:35.568
Then make me a part of your new life.

01:20:36.742 --> 01:20:38.300
Let me be part of it.

01:20:40.012 --> 01:20:42.412
Show me, educate me, involve me.

01:20:43.248 --> 01:20:46.046
I'm ready now.
I wasn't before, but I'm ready now.

01:20:57.262 --> 01:20:58.422
Candy?

01:21:04.336 --> 01:21:06.133
Are you ready for me, Frank?

01:21:08.173 --> 01:21:09.538
Are you really?

01:21:12.010 --> 01:21:14.240
I seem to be a very special person.

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:17.744
I'm in the middle of a strange adventure.

01:21:20.319 --> 01:21:21.752
Let me be with you.

01:21:24.022 --> 01:21:26.286
I want to go with you wherever you go.

01:21:27.259 --> 01:21:28.226
Do you?

01:21:32.331 --> 01:21:33.298
Do you?

01:21:35.901 --> 01:21:36.868
Yes.

01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:39.767
Then look.

01:22:22.247 --> 01:22:23.214
Daddy?

01:22:24.616 --> 01:22:26.982
Is it time to go to school yet?

01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:29.283
No, sweetheart.

01:22:30.556 --> 01:22:31.818
It's Dr. Hal.

01:22:32.858 --> 01:22:35.292
And Daddy's downstairs talking to Mommy.

01:22:36.161 --> 01:22:37.628
He wants to see you.

01:23:52.004 --> 01:23:53.369
Oh, God, Nola.

01:23:55.674 --> 01:23:58.507
No, I disgust you.

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.470
I sicken you.

01:24:03.882 --> 01:24:05.713
You hate me.

01:24:08.153 --> 01:24:10.713
You didn't come here because you love me.

01:24:11.156 --> 01:24:14.922
You came here to take our daughter away
and give her to somebody else.

01:24:19.231 --> 01:24:20.823
I wouldn't do that.

01:24:21.767 --> 01:24:23.291
I wouldn't do that to you.

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:34.704
You go out of that door.
You find your daddy.

01:24:40.919 --> 01:24:43.410
You liar. You're lying.

01:24:45.157 --> 01:24:48.456
You're lying! I know!

01:25:32.237 --> 01:25:35.866
I know you so well, and it won't work.

01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:41.777
I'd kill Candice
before I let you take her away from me.

01:25:42.447 --> 01:25:43.937
Do you hear me?

01:25:44.983 --> 01:25:48.282
I'd kill Candice before I let you take her!

01:26:26.191 --> 01:26:27.453
Make them stop.

01:26:36.034 --> 01:26:38.434
They're doing what you want them to do.

01:26:44.476 --> 01:26:46.068
You want them to kill Candice.

01:26:50.482 --> 01:26:53.042
You make them stop, or I'll kill you.

01:26:53.285 --> 01:26:54.843
Kill me.

01:29:25.437 --> 01:29:26.995
We're going home, Candy.

01:29:30.108 --> 01:29:31.234
We're going home.
