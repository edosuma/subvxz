03:35.860 --> 03:37.260
Mmm.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.100
This is so good.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.340
I want more.

03:42.340 --> 03:43.820
Don't get greedy.

03:44.860 --> 03:46.220
Jeff?

03:46.220 --> 03:47.940
Hayley.

03:47.940 --> 03:49.300
Sorry.

03:49.300 --> 03:52.340
I was gonna be, like,
so sophisticated when we met.

03:52.340 --> 03:55.780
Little hard to do that with your
mouth full of whatever that is.

03:55.780 --> 03:57.940
It's great. It's great.
Do you want some?

03:57.940 --> 03:59.140
Sure.

04:03.420 --> 04:04.820
Yum.

04:04.820 --> 04:07.220
It's, um...kind of
what I was thinking.

04:07.220 --> 04:08.460
Sorry?

04:10.500 --> 04:11.940
You just don't look like
the kind of guy

04:11.940 --> 04:15.140
who has to meet girls
over the internet.

04:15.140 --> 04:18.500
I think it's better to meet
people online first sometimes.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
You get to know
what they're like inside.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.540
When you work as a photographer,
you find out real quick,

04:22.540 --> 04:24.140
people's faces lie.

04:26.780 --> 04:29.140
Does my face lie?

04:30.180 --> 04:33.060
I look at those eyes
and I see...

04:33.060 --> 04:34.580
a girl who reads Zadie Smith,

04:34.580 --> 04:37.180
who listens to John Mayer
and ColdPlay,

04:37.180 --> 04:40.900
who loves Monty Python episodes

04:40.900 --> 04:42.820
and who, desperately,

04:42.820 --> 04:45.860
madly, deeply, wants,

04:45.860 --> 04:49.100
needs, longs for...

04:49.100 --> 04:51.260
more chocolate.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.700
Excellent, excellent
judge of character.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.660
Can I get two of those truffles

05:01.660 --> 05:03.780
and two ganaches?

05:03.780 --> 05:05.660
Now what's a ganache?

05:05.660 --> 05:08.900
You don't know
what a ganache is?

05:08.900 --> 05:11.140
Lucky you're with
a woman of the world

05:11.140 --> 05:13.660
to introduce you
to these things.

05:13.660 --> 05:15.180
And two
chocolate-covered hearts.

05:15.180 --> 05:17.300
And a decaf latte for me.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.580
And...?
I'm good.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.500
Yeah, you do appear so.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.140
So what's in the bag?

05:26.980 --> 05:29.660
Oh, you know, just,
like, books and stuff.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.340
I figured if you stood me up,

05:31.340 --> 05:33.700
then I should have
something to read.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.380
Well...I couldn't really decide.

05:37.940 --> 05:39.540
I'm reading this book
about Jean Seberg.

05:40.580 --> 05:41.980
She's this actress

05:41.980 --> 05:44.300
who slept with all
the wrong people

05:44.300 --> 05:47.260
and ended up killing herself.

05:47.260 --> 05:48.740
Don't you do that.

05:48.740 --> 05:52.220
No. I-I intend to sleep
with all the right people.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.620
Plus, I'm reading
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

05:55.620 --> 05:56.860
It's a ninth grade book,

05:56.860 --> 05:58.740
but I figured
I could have it done

05:58.740 --> 06:00.900
before the school
year starts, so...

06:00.900 --> 06:02.540
Doesn't look like
Elizabethan tragedy.

06:04.340 --> 06:07.500
Oh, ah, no, that's 'cause--

06:07.500 --> 06:09.300
Well, my dad--
he's letting me audit

06:09.300 --> 06:10.780
one of his med
school courses, right?

06:10.780 --> 06:13.060
I don't really understand
half of it,

06:13.060 --> 06:14.580
but I totally love it.

06:14.580 --> 06:16.060
What?

06:16.060 --> 06:17.700
So you go to UCW

06:17.700 --> 06:21.020
and you sit in a lecture hall
with all these grad students

06:21.020 --> 06:23.980
and, what,
do they hit on you?

06:26.100 --> 06:29.020
Why? Are you jealous?
Just admiring.

06:29.020 --> 06:31.860
I didn't know you were interested
in that kind of thing.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.140
What?

06:33.140 --> 06:35.540
You thought since we'd been
chatting for three weeks

06:35.540 --> 06:37.580
that you knew
everything about me?

06:37.580 --> 06:39.940
Plus, they wouldn't hit
on a 14-year-old girl.

06:39.940 --> 06:43.060
They're, like, old enough
to be my dad, so...

06:44.180 --> 06:45.940
They're like...

06:45.940 --> 06:48.420
They're bad older.
They're-- You're not--

06:50.820 --> 06:52.740
I'm so articulate.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.500
Sorry. Can I just,
like, start over?

06:54.500 --> 06:57.820
No. I get it. I get it.
I just thought...

06:57.820 --> 07:00.940
You know, well, you look
older than you are.

07:00.940 --> 07:03.340
You certainly act
older than you are.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.300
Really?

07:07.300 --> 07:11.100
Yeah. I was expecting someone
not as impressive.

07:12.940 --> 07:14.300
Me too.

07:19.860 --> 07:20.980
Cool shirt.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.140
You want it?

07:23.220 --> 07:25.500
No, I didn't really bring
enough bucks, so...

07:25.500 --> 07:27.540
And yet, not actually
what I was asking.

07:27.540 --> 07:28.980
Sure, I want it.

07:28.980 --> 07:32.020
Can I get a green shirt
in a small, please?

07:32.020 --> 07:33.500
No. No, no.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
I can't let you do that.
What? Because--

07:35.500 --> 07:37.260
Because--
What? Because you'd be so

07:37.260 --> 07:38.980
indebted to me
that you'd have to...

07:38.980 --> 07:42.140
Okay. I guess I can
let you do that.

07:42.140 --> 07:43.900
You have to model
it for me, though.

07:43.900 --> 07:48.100
Conditions. I can't live
with all these conditions.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.260
Thanks.

07:52.140 --> 07:54.620
This is so unfair.
What?

07:54.620 --> 07:57.260
This is when things happen,
in the middle of the night,

07:57.260 --> 07:59.780
by which time I am completely
out of the scene.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.740
Life as a teenager.

08:01.740 --> 08:04.980
I just hate having to depend on
Lindsey to drive me everywhere.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.460
You'll be driving
before you know it.

08:06.460 --> 08:07.940
In the meantime,

08:07.940 --> 08:10.580
I missed Elizabeth Wurtzel
speaking at USC

08:10.580 --> 08:12.140
and the Goldfrapp concert.

08:12.140 --> 08:14.420
I was at the Goldfrapp
concert actually.

08:14.420 --> 08:16.660
Shut up. You were?
Mm-hmm.

08:16.660 --> 08:18.020
Was it great?

08:18.020 --> 08:20.060
Of course it was great.
What am I saying?

08:20.060 --> 08:22.220
Well, you could judge
for yourself.

08:22.220 --> 08:24.820
I got a bootleg MP3.
You have the concert?

08:24.820 --> 08:25.980
Just one song.

08:25.980 --> 08:28.700
A little louder, please,
so the authorities know.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.460
I totally have to hear it.

08:30.460 --> 08:31.540
I'll send it to you.

08:31.540 --> 08:35.059
After you get home,
after you get around to it.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.100
Good things are worth the wait.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.260
Oh....

08:39.260 --> 08:41.340
And what have you waited
for recently?

08:41.340 --> 08:43.980
I'm gonna have to wait
four years for you.

08:43.980 --> 08:46.940
You are just trying
to distract me from that MP3.

08:46.940 --> 08:48.460
Look, I have to send it.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.860
It's not like I could just
take you over to my house.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.620
That would be
a little insane.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.540
True.

08:55.540 --> 08:57.300
Okay, now don't peek.

08:58.220 --> 09:00.060
I shoot models for a living.

09:00.060 --> 09:01.780
I've seen it all before.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.620
And you're so sure about that?

09:03.620 --> 09:04.860
I'm thinkin' yeah.

09:04.860 --> 09:06.180
Maybe you should peek

09:06.180 --> 09:09.140
and make that clerk wonder
what's going on over here.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.100
In your dreams, little girl.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.620
Little girl?

09:14.620 --> 09:18.100
Whatever happened
to how mature I was?

09:20.020 --> 09:22.900
Is this mature enough for you?
Okay...

09:22.900 --> 09:25.940
Keep teasing me like that,
you're gonna drive me crazy.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.660
Is that so?

09:27.660 --> 09:29.340
Okay. All right.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.700
How's this?

09:33.700 --> 09:34.660
Nice.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.820
Okay.

09:37.820 --> 09:39.580
Now, there's three points
I have to make.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.020
One: you wouldn't take
advantage because

09:42.020 --> 09:44.260
you've been seen
with me here today.

09:44.260 --> 09:46.980
And two: it's Goldfrapp.

09:46.980 --> 09:49.260
And three?

09:49.260 --> 09:50.940
Well, and three--

09:50.940 --> 09:53.220
You said that it would
be insane for me

09:53.220 --> 09:55.780
to come over and...

09:55.780 --> 10:00.580
Four-- Four out of five doctors
agree that I am actually insane.

10:00.580 --> 10:03.340
Thus, I have to come over

10:03.340 --> 10:05.580
in order to be true to myself.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.860
Right?

10:21.780 --> 10:24.900
And the fourth reason:
this amazing car.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.260
Well, in the face
of logic like that,

10:27.260 --> 10:29.100
I bow down
and worship.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.180
Bow down?

10:31.460 --> 10:34.180
That's a good idea.
What are you waiting for?

10:34.180 --> 10:35.420
Worship me.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.340
Yes, oh, royal Thonggirl.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.700
I am not worthy
to kiss your feet.

10:44.980 --> 10:46.740
Well...maybe you are.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.660
Maybe we should,
like, get going.

10:57.940 --> 11:00.980
Yes, oh,
magnificent Thonggirl.

11:00.980 --> 11:05.300
You wanna call your sister?
Tell her where you'll be?

11:05.300 --> 11:07.700
Maybe later. I just wanna
get in this car.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.620
Wow. So hot.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.860
What's wrong?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.980
Well, they teach
us "young things"

12:18.980 --> 12:21.340
not to drink anything we haven't
mixed ourselves, so...

12:21.340 --> 12:22.980
Smart.

12:22.980 --> 12:25.164
Come back in the kitchen.
I'll pour it again.

12:25.190 --> 12:26.420
No.
Come on.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.260
I can whip up something
more entertaining than that.

12:38.140 --> 12:39.300
Oh...

12:39.300 --> 12:40.740
Healthy dude, huh?

12:40.740 --> 12:42.620
I try.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.900
Figure I'll live
as long as I can.

12:47.140 --> 12:48.980
Living long is overrated.

12:48.980 --> 12:51.540
What? You don't want
to reach a ripe, old age?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.380
For what?
When I'm 80?

12:55.380 --> 12:57.420
What do I do for fun?

12:57.420 --> 12:59.860
When you're 80 I'll be 98.

12:59.860 --> 13:02.660
Right... and useless to me.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.180
What use do you have
in mind for me?

13:16.700 --> 13:19.740
Ah. I knew there'd be
something fun around here.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.740
I bet these babes
got some dirt on you.

13:28.740 --> 13:30.100
Those are models.

13:30.100 --> 13:34.660
So why are they on your walls
instead of magazine covers?

13:36.100 --> 13:39.260
Here, looking at you while

13:39.260 --> 13:43.860
you know, you do
the most intimate things.

13:43.860 --> 13:45.860
My house is my studio.

13:45.860 --> 13:49.660
When clients come here, they're
walking into my giant portfolio.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.620
So, what?
These were all shot here?

13:55.220 --> 13:56.620
Oh, my God.

13:58.140 --> 14:00.860
Okay, you are like
a big deal, aren't you?

14:00.860 --> 14:03.220
I get work.

14:03.220 --> 14:07.380
Isn't that one of those cameras
that gives you the square image?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.740
How do you know that?

14:09.980 --> 14:13.460
I'm a goon. I just, like,
read constantly.

14:13.460 --> 14:15.620
You saw all those
books in my bag.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.340
You're not reading now.

14:18.340 --> 14:20.020
I'm not, am I?

14:24.260 --> 14:25.540
Feels good.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.940
Don't fall behind.

14:29.940 --> 14:31.340
We should toast.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.660
<i>Carpe...</i>

14:35.940 --> 14:37.780
<i>omnious.</i>

14:37.780 --> 14:39.380
What's that?

14:40.620 --> 14:42.860
It's my own little toast.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.500
You know <i>carpe diem.</i>

14:44.500 --> 14:45.660
"Seize the day."

14:45.660 --> 14:48.460
So I figure, <i>carpe omnious.</i>

14:48.460 --> 14:50.180
"Take it all."

14:51.460 --> 14:53.060
Take it all.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.220
So, like,

15:00.220 --> 15:03.660
what is it like to look through
your lens at some...

15:03.660 --> 15:06.300
beautiful woman
who's working so hard

15:06.300 --> 15:07.980
to look good for you?

15:07.980 --> 15:10.580
You know these models.
They all have handlers.

15:10.580 --> 15:13.140
People to make sure
their hair is just right

15:13.140 --> 15:14.580
and their makeup is okay

15:14.580 --> 15:17.660
and they don't get lost on
their way to their next gig.

15:17.660 --> 15:20.020
So you never get
to be alone with them?

15:20.020 --> 15:22.340
Rarely.
Poor Jeff.

15:22.340 --> 15:24.980
I am compensated for my
troubles. Don't worry about me.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.900
But I like worrying about you.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.060
It makes me wonder...

15:32.060 --> 15:32.980
What?

15:35.140 --> 15:36.980
No, no. Forget it.

15:36.980 --> 15:38.580
No, come on.

15:38.580 --> 15:41.220
Come on. What's in that
insane mind of yours?

15:46.580 --> 15:48.620
Okay. We'll have
another screwdriver

15:48.620 --> 15:50.740
and then maybe I'll tell you.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.460
I'm waiting.
Hold on.

15:55.460 --> 15:58.020
You are not keeping up.

16:03.580 --> 16:04.780
What?

16:04.780 --> 16:07.580
Here's where you're supposed
to make it easier for me

16:07.580 --> 16:09.060
and read my mind.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.700
You're wondering how many
models I've done it with.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.020
No.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.620
How many?
None of them.

16:20.620 --> 16:24.660
Oh, get out.
No. They're underage, mostly.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.060
I'd be arrested.

16:26.060 --> 16:28.060
So you're not arrested

16:28.060 --> 16:29.620
for photographing
them like this?

16:29.620 --> 16:32.140
I'm very aware
of the legal boundaries.

16:32.140 --> 16:33.900
I have to be.
Right. Right.

16:33.900 --> 16:37.260
'Cause secretly...
Secretly...

16:37.260 --> 16:39.460
you would like to do them.

16:39.460 --> 16:42.620
No. There's just one
that I slept with

16:42.620 --> 16:45.620
when we were both younger.

16:47.060 --> 16:48.060
That one?

16:48.060 --> 16:49.940
Not out here.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.940
In the bedroom?
No--

17:00.180 --> 17:02.180
What's her name?

17:02.180 --> 17:03.180
Hey.

17:03.180 --> 17:05.260
"Janelle."

17:05.260 --> 17:06.780
Yeah. Janelle.

17:08.740 --> 17:10.060
So, what? What?

17:10.060 --> 17:13.060
Was she, like, the first big
girlfriend or something?

17:13.060 --> 17:14.420
That's right.

17:15.579 --> 17:17.940
Learned everything I knew
practicing on her.

17:17.940 --> 17:19.619
And that date--

17:19.619 --> 17:23.099
Was that the first time
that you guys...

17:24.180 --> 17:25.660
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:29.820 --> 17:31.780
So, what? Where is she now?

17:31.780 --> 17:35.420
She actually signed with Ford
right after this shoot.

17:35.420 --> 17:38.500
She really took off. She, um...
Oh, my God.

17:38.500 --> 17:42.380
She is, like, on magazine
covers. I know her.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.940
Well, like, not personally,
obviously, but...

17:46.220 --> 17:48.100
You are impressive
every second.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.300
The models are impressive.
I just know how to bring it out.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.660
You still love her.

17:54.660 --> 17:55.860
No.

17:55.860 --> 17:57.180
Ah...yeah.

17:57.180 --> 17:58.180
No.
Yeah!

17:58.180 --> 17:59.420
No.
Really?

17:59.420 --> 18:00.780
No.
Really, really, really?

18:00.780 --> 18:01.820
No.

18:03.820 --> 18:06.500
I still love how simple things
were back then but...

18:06.500 --> 18:08.140
You know, I--

18:09.260 --> 18:11.700
I don't want to forget
that, but...

18:11.700 --> 18:13.100
we've moved on.

18:20.940 --> 18:22.740
You're lonely.

18:22.740 --> 18:24.340
No.

18:24.340 --> 18:26.740
I can hear it in your voice.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.260
I'm a big boy.

18:30.980 --> 18:34.620
I guess everyone kind of
has a Janelle, right?

18:34.620 --> 18:36.100
I guess.

18:37.860 --> 18:40.700
Hey. What if you got
one of your cameras

18:40.700 --> 18:43.580
and we can see what you
can bring out in me.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.820
This is what you wanted to ask?
Well, I--

18:45.820 --> 18:48.220
It's not as easy as you think.
Okay.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.460
Models don't just
pout their lips.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.740
They have to be willing
to open up.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.340
They have to show us
a little of their soul,

18:55.340 --> 18:57.500
their secrets.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.780
And most people only
open up from weakness.

18:59.780 --> 19:03.140
Nobody wants to see photos
of weak people.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.980
We look at great models
because they open up...

19:05.980 --> 19:07.620
from a position of...

19:09.020 --> 19:10.060
of, uh, of strength.

19:10.060 --> 19:12.020
They have the strength...

19:12.020 --> 19:13.820
to believe they
can do anything,

19:13.820 --> 19:17.180
no matter how crazy, or, uh...

19:17.180 --> 19:19.260
Are you okay?

19:19.260 --> 19:20.740
Uh...

19:21.660 --> 19:23.220
Let's try something.
Okay.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.660
Uh-uh. Do me out here.

19:30.820 --> 19:32.900
I shoot everyone in my studio.
Oh, come on.

19:36.020 --> 19:37.620
Clearly not.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.380
Come on, Jeff. Shoot me.

19:43.380 --> 19:44.980
Come on. Shoot me.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.380
Shoot me.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.580
Don't do that.
What?

19:50.580 --> 19:53.060
That phony music video crap.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.420
Come on.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.060
Just be yourself.

19:57.060 --> 19:59.380
Just be open.

19:59.380 --> 20:02.140
Weren't you just listening to me?
Come on, Jeff.

20:02.140 --> 20:02.980
Sit down. Shoot me.

20:03.006 --> 20:04.860
Look at me.

20:04.860 --> 20:06.180
Be honest.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.140
Would you listen to me?
Just sit down.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.500
Jeff, I don't--
Sit down.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.460
J-Jeff, I don't--
Sit down!

20:16.220 --> 20:17.340
Are you okay?

20:18.420 --> 20:20.580
I don't feel so good.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.380
Did you-- Did you call me?

20:56.940 --> 21:00.180
Sorry. I was just looking
through your medicine cabinet.

21:00.180 --> 21:03.700
Okay, boring! No <i>Valley of
the Dolls</i> stuff at all.

21:03.700 --> 21:07.220
Can't help but wondering
why all the lubricants though.

21:09.580 --> 21:13.340
Oh, hey, just--
Tell me when you're ready.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.700
Take your time.

21:18.220 --> 21:20.300
What did you...

21:20.300 --> 21:22.740
What di--
You remember what I said

21:22.740 --> 21:26.540
about not drinking anything
you didn't mix yourself?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.180
That's good advice
for everyone.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.780
You know what? I'm sorry
you were drugged for so long.

21:37.780 --> 21:39.700
I've never really
done that before

21:39.700 --> 21:41.300
and I swiped this
from my dad.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.100
Didn't come with directions

21:43.100 --> 21:45.100
and it's not like
I could just ask him

21:45.100 --> 21:46.940
how much to use.

21:46.980 --> 21:48.580
So I probably used too much

21:48.580 --> 21:50.100
or those screwdrivers

21:50.100 --> 21:53.100
could have affected
my judgment, you think?

22:00.340 --> 22:01.660
It's real water.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.140
Scout's honor.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.100
Ahh.

22:14.180 --> 22:15.380
Wha--?

22:16.780 --> 22:19.620
Why do I get...
tied up first

22:19.620 --> 22:22.540
if this is how
we're gonna play?

22:25.660 --> 22:26.660
Jeff...

22:28.180 --> 22:30.100
play time is over.

22:31.740 --> 22:33.900
Now it's time to wake up.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.700
This isn't funny.

22:57.060 --> 22:59.860
Is this some...teenage joke?

23:04.260 --> 23:05.660
Teenage...

23:06.980 --> 23:08.020
yes.

23:09.540 --> 23:10.660
Joke?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.380
No.

23:16.780 --> 23:18.420
Now let me--
Patience.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.540
Let me go. Let me go!
Patience.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.780
Let me go!
Patience.

23:24.460 --> 23:28.180
I'm just checking out
the side of the house, okay?

23:29.940 --> 23:32.580
You know, I saw this cop show
once. It was great.

23:32.580 --> 23:33.700
And the killer,

23:33.700 --> 23:36.140
he thought he had cleaned
up all the evidence

23:36.140 --> 23:38.980
but some of the victim's
blood was on his shirt

23:38.980 --> 23:40.580
and, yeah, sure,
he washed it,

23:40.580 --> 23:44.180
but some of the dried up blood
got caught in the lint trap,

23:45.180 --> 23:46.260
I mean...

23:48.020 --> 23:50.300
Anything in here
I should know about?

23:51.540 --> 23:53.340
What the fuck are you doing?

23:54.460 --> 23:56.620
That's kind of been
my question, Jeff.

23:57.540 --> 23:59.860
What the fuck are you doing,

23:59.860 --> 24:01.980
living in a house filled
with pictures

24:01.980 --> 24:04.460
of half-naked teenage girls?

24:04.460 --> 24:07.260
Oh, none of whom
you've ever done it with--

24:07.260 --> 24:09.340
Help! Help!

24:09.340 --> 24:11.420
Help! He--

24:18.180 --> 24:22.860
There is really no point
in me taking any risks, Jeff.

24:22.860 --> 24:26.140
Technically, I could let you
scream your fucking brains out

24:26.140 --> 24:28.780
and no one is going
to hear you.

24:28.820 --> 24:32.220
Yeah, I waited till today
because Mr. Coughlin is at work,

24:32.220 --> 24:33.660
and the Kraskows--

24:33.660 --> 24:35.900
they're vacationing
in Santa Barbara.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.860
Still, I can't have
some pedestrian

24:38.860 --> 24:40.700
just happening by
as you're screaming,

24:40.700 --> 24:45.140
so shut up or next time
it's gonna be bleach, okay?

24:52.660 --> 24:55.020
You've been stalking me?

24:57.220 --> 24:58.100
Okay.

24:59.220 --> 25:00.940
All right. Let's get
this straight.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.380
You have been stalking me.

25:05.780 --> 25:09.660
Yeah. I went into other chat
rooms, with different nicknames.

25:09.660 --> 25:12.540
You would get to know
each woman...

25:12.540 --> 25:14.740
and then as soon as
you found out

25:14.740 --> 25:16.540
they were any
bit older than me

25:16.540 --> 25:19.220
you would just drop
them like that.

25:20.340 --> 25:23.460
You took your time
sniffing out someone my age.

25:23.460 --> 25:26.260
I didn't talk to the others
because they were boring.

25:26.260 --> 25:28.820
You and I connected.
Oh, mm-hmm, right.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.380
Come on. You think
I faked all that?

25:32.380 --> 25:35.860
You know, actually
it's kind of funny.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.340
Because every time
I would mention

25:38.340 --> 25:40.860
some, like, obscure
singer or band,

25:40.860 --> 25:43.460
you knew so much about them.

25:44.180 --> 25:45.940
But not right away.

25:45.940 --> 25:48.140
It was, like,
a few minutes later.

25:49.460 --> 25:53.780
Maybe to give you enough time
to look them up on the web?

25:54.820 --> 25:55.940
Jeff...

25:58.220 --> 26:01.300
you used the same phrases
about Goldfrapp

26:01.300 --> 26:03.900
as they do on Amazon.com.

26:06.420 --> 26:07.420
Busted.

26:11.940 --> 26:13.380
By the way,

26:13.380 --> 26:17.860
I fucking hate...
<i>Goldfrapp.</i>

26:22.260 --> 26:24.260
Come on.

26:24.260 --> 26:26.780
I wanted to impress you.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.060
I'm not the first guy
to do something stupid

26:29.060 --> 26:30.620
to impress a girl.

26:30.660 --> 26:32.940
Does that deserve being
tied up and tortured?

26:35.780 --> 26:36.980
Torture?

26:40.460 --> 26:42.020
Is this torture to you?

26:43.460 --> 26:45.020
I guess you've never
read anything

26:45.060 --> 26:46.420
by Amnesty International

26:46.420 --> 26:48.860
or Human Rights Watch
because this...

26:54.820 --> 26:58.140
This... is nothing.

27:27.260 --> 27:30.780
Of course you're not the first
guy to lie to a girl, Jeff.

27:32.140 --> 27:35.300
The operative word
there being "girl."

27:35.300 --> 27:37.340
I mean, you know
how old I am.

27:37.340 --> 27:40.500
What makes a kid who's barely
past her first period

27:40.500 --> 27:42.940
worth all this research?

27:42.940 --> 27:45.340
I mean, you really got
to start to wonder

27:45.340 --> 27:47.660
when a grown man goes
through all this trouble

27:47.660 --> 27:49.300
just to charm a girl.

27:49.300 --> 27:52.020
Wow. There's that word again.

27:52.020 --> 27:53.420
"Girl."

27:56.020 --> 27:58.900
You know, maybe it's
this whole camera thing?

28:00.740 --> 28:03.980
Cameras...computers.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.540
They let you hide, don't they?

28:06.540 --> 28:08.020
So safe.

28:10.180 --> 28:14.140
I heard how your voice changed
when the camera came between us.

28:14.180 --> 28:16.860
My voice changed
because I felt sick

28:16.900 --> 28:18.780
because you drugged me.

28:18.820 --> 28:20.540
Yeah, you were drugged,
all right.

28:22.140 --> 28:23.500
And the drug was sweet,

28:23.500 --> 28:27.740
little 14-year-old flesh.

28:28.980 --> 28:30.860
Look...

28:30.860 --> 28:33.460
I'm a decent guy,
ask anyone.

28:33.460 --> 28:36.580
Go ahead. Call these models.
They'll tell you.

28:37.620 --> 28:40.060
Of course they will.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.220
You're not an idiot, Jeff.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.660
You don't piss where you live.

28:44.660 --> 28:47.940
Those girls were your work
and I, on the other hand was...

28:49.100 --> 28:50.580
your play.

28:50.580 --> 28:52.900
You were coming on to me.
Oh, come on.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.220
That's what they always say.

28:54.220 --> 28:55.540
Who?
Who?

28:55.540 --> 28:56.940
The pedophiles!

28:56.980 --> 28:59.700
"She was so sexy.
She was asking for it."

28:59.700 --> 29:02.860
"She was only technically
a girl. She acted like a woman."

29:02.900 --> 29:06.740
It's just so easy
to blame a kid, isn't it?

29:09.220 --> 29:12.060
Just because a girl
knows how to imitate a woman

29:12.060 --> 29:15.740
does not mean she's ready
to do what a woman does.

29:17.220 --> 29:20.540
I mean, you're
the grown-up here.

29:20.580 --> 29:22.940
If a kid is experimenting

29:22.940 --> 29:25.580
and says something
flirtatious, you ignore it.

29:25.580 --> 29:27.900
You don't encourage it.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.500
If a kid says,
"Hey, let's make screwdrivers,"

29:30.500 --> 29:31.980
you take the alcohol away

29:31.980 --> 29:34.340
and you don't race them
to the next drink!

29:34.340 --> 29:35.580
Look, look.

29:35.580 --> 29:37.380
I've been lonely, okay?

29:37.380 --> 29:40.940
That makes me stupid
but I am not a pedophile.

29:40.940 --> 29:43.220
I am not lonely.
This is some horrible mistake.

29:43.220 --> 29:44.151
And not stupid. Untie me.

29:44.177 --> 29:46.740
We'll forget this whole thing.
Just untie me now!

29:46.740 --> 29:49.660
I might be a little peeved.
So when I am ready to go,

29:49.660 --> 29:52.820
I'll call a cab and call another
one to let you loose.

29:52.820 --> 29:55.340
When will that be?
I'm not sure yet.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.180
Don't--

30:07.180 --> 30:09.380
You can save yourself
so much time

30:09.380 --> 30:11.660
by just dropping that word
from your vocabulary.

30:11.660 --> 30:13.900
I'm gonna do
what I want, Jeff.

30:19.060 --> 30:20.620
See...

30:20.620 --> 30:24.340
a guy as smooth at seducing
adolescents as you are

30:24.340 --> 30:28.300
and takes those photographs--

30:28.300 --> 30:29.620
I just figure

30:29.620 --> 30:31.740
he has something around
that he doesn't want seen,

30:31.740 --> 30:34.500
and when I find that,

30:34.500 --> 30:36.660
then maybe I'll know
what I'm dealing with.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.860
What you're dealing with?

30:37.860 --> 30:40.500
I mean, what kind
of pedophile are you?

30:40.500 --> 30:41.580
Just a voyeur?

30:41.580 --> 30:43.260
Again, not a pedophile.

30:43.260 --> 30:46.260
Right. You're a photographer.

30:46.260 --> 30:47.660
Takes a genius to get paid

30:47.700 --> 30:49.900
for what you'd be happy
to do for free.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.580
Go into the living room.

30:51.580 --> 30:54.220
Look in the grey cabinet.
Pull out the third drawer down.

30:54.260 --> 30:55.740
You'll see prints
of my work

30:55.740 --> 30:58.220
for all kinds
of environmental groups.

30:58.220 --> 31:01.100
I've done shots of
the Yukon Territory,

31:01.100 --> 31:03.220
the Utah wilderness,

31:03.220 --> 31:05.540
Inuit villages in Alaska...

31:08.220 --> 31:09.740
So what?

31:09.780 --> 31:13.020
You love nature, thus you
must be a nice guy?

31:13.020 --> 31:16.340
I'm saying my modeling shots
are just part of my portfolio.

31:16.340 --> 31:18.180
I've shot a lot of
different subjects,

31:18.180 --> 31:19.900
some of it very important work.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.780
And it was so important
that you thought,

31:22.820 --> 31:25.860
"Well, I can't possibly
hang it on the walls of my home.

31:25.860 --> 31:28.340
I need to plaster my house
with pictures of underage nymphs

31:28.340 --> 31:30.060
and just tuck the nature
shots away."

31:36.700 --> 31:40.700
So...a voyeur
and a conservationist.

31:40.700 --> 31:42.900
I'm not a voyeur!

31:42.900 --> 31:44.260
Not just a voyeur.

31:44.260 --> 31:47.020
Sometimes you kick it up
a notch to molestation.

31:47.020 --> 31:48.380
I am not a molester!

31:48.380 --> 31:50.500
I've no idea who you've
confused me with.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.340
Sometimes you molest someone
and they fight back

31:52.340 --> 31:54.580
and you lose control
and you hurt them.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.780
I have never hurt anyone!

32:00.700 --> 32:02.740
We'll just see, won't we?

32:11.300 --> 32:13.620
Those letters are mine.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.380
Nothing's yours when you invite
a teenager into your home.

32:25.540 --> 32:27.820
Don't love her anymore, huh?

32:27.820 --> 32:30.780
That explains why
you save these.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.740
I thought about selling
them on e-Bay.

32:33.740 --> 32:34.900
Excuse me?

32:36.300 --> 32:40.180
Sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Maybe it was the music or...

32:40.180 --> 32:42.660
I don't know.
Maybe it was the bullshit.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.020
All right. Honestly...

32:44.020 --> 32:47.780
Some day I thought about
sending them to her,

32:47.780 --> 32:50.460
reminding her how much
of a bitch she was.

32:50.460 --> 32:52.220
Oh.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.900
A little angry, are we?

32:53.940 --> 32:56.660
She broke your heart
and you haven't gotten over it?

32:56.660 --> 32:58.020
You walk into somebody's house,

32:58.020 --> 32:59.660
you start looking
through their shit--

32:59.660 --> 33:02.140
You're gonna find things
that embarrasses them.

33:02.140 --> 33:03.500
It doesn't mean anything.

33:05.660 --> 33:07.020
All right. Okay.

33:11.940 --> 33:13.580
"Dear Jeff.

33:13.580 --> 33:17.380
"You have to stop. I can't
go where you wanna take me.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.660
You're just not the person
I thought you were."

33:19.660 --> 33:22.260
You don't have to read it.
I know what it says.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.460
I bet you do. How many
times did you read this

33:24.460 --> 33:25.460
over to yourself?

33:25.460 --> 33:26.820
None of your business.

33:26.820 --> 33:29.540
What kind of person did she
find out you were, Jeff?

33:29.540 --> 33:30.820
None of your business.

33:30.820 --> 33:34.460
That kind of depends on how
you define business, actually.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.780
So, what? Did you find her?

33:37.780 --> 33:39.100
The girl you wanted?

33:39.100 --> 33:40.900
Is this what your work is,
some kind of big search?

33:59.740 --> 34:01.300
Are you the type of guy

34:01.300 --> 34:04.060
who likes to save his
outgoing e-mails?

34:04.060 --> 34:08.500
Read them over and over again,
to think about what you said?

34:11.300 --> 34:13.460
This is weird.

34:14.820 --> 34:18.460
Your download manager says you
pulled some photos off the net,

34:18.500 --> 34:22.739
but...I can't find them.

34:22.739 --> 34:25.940
Gosh, that's strange.

34:25.940 --> 34:30.260
Yeah. A smart guy doesn't leave
photos on his computer.

34:30.260 --> 34:33.340
'Cause that's the first place
the cops are gonna look.

34:33.340 --> 34:37.100
And then you're...
into mementos.

34:37.100 --> 34:41.179
So where do you put
the stuff that you...

34:41.219 --> 34:42.659
pull off the net, hm?

34:44.340 --> 34:47.780
Do you have a special little
hiding place or something?

34:47.780 --> 34:49.060
I live alone.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.620
Why would I need
a hiding place?

34:54.260 --> 34:55.500
Just what I've been wondering.

34:55.500 --> 34:58.980
I have looked through
your whole house.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.420
Everything....

35:01.420 --> 35:03.660
and I have found no porn.

35:03.660 --> 35:07.100
I have not found
a single bit...

35:07.140 --> 35:09.340
of porn.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.900
Guys tend to have porn
around don't they?

35:11.900 --> 35:13.700
Nothing against it,
nothing against them.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.580
It's just the way
they're brought up.

35:15.620 --> 35:18.540
Seriously, if a guy knows
he can get away with it,

35:18.580 --> 35:21.660
all guys, they have porn at
least somewhere in their crib.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.740
You've done studies on this.
Then I was thinking--

35:25.660 --> 35:29.420
that these photos on his wall,
maybe those are his porn.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.700
But I bet they're not
your stroke shots.

35:34.180 --> 35:36.460
I bet whatever you have is so...

35:36.460 --> 35:38.220
juicy,

35:38.220 --> 35:41.500
it needs its own
little cubbyhole.

35:43.380 --> 35:45.900
Isn't that right, Jeff?

37:22.020 --> 37:24.180
So what's
the combination, Jeff?

37:24.180 --> 37:25.900
Eat me.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.820
Look at how he's sweating.

37:27.820 --> 37:30.020
Does this worry you, Jeff?

37:30.020 --> 37:34.380
I'm gonna figure it out, so you
might as well just tell me.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.340
I am an honor student.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.660
Take your time.

37:39.780 --> 37:41.540
Oh, I will.

37:41.540 --> 37:44.180
Believe me, I've got plenty.
No, not much.

37:44.180 --> 37:45.780
Aren't mommy and daddy
gonna worry

37:45.780 --> 37:48.740
if you're not
home before dinner?

37:48.740 --> 37:50.620
I'm thinking, no.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.780
Oh, is that it?

37:53.780 --> 37:56.540
What? They're too busy
to keep track of you,

37:56.540 --> 37:57.980
so you reach out to
somebody who seems like

37:58.020 --> 38:00.020
he might care about you?

38:00.020 --> 38:02.900
And you're so mad
because they ignore you?

38:02.900 --> 38:05.260
They always made the fuss
over your older sister

38:05.260 --> 38:08.580
because she learned
to do everything first?

38:08.580 --> 38:10.140
You're furious with them,

38:10.140 --> 38:11.780
but they do love you

38:11.780 --> 38:14.060
and they pay
for your existence,

38:14.060 --> 38:16.660
but you can't let them
see any of that anger.

38:19.540 --> 38:23.620
I'm not angry at them.
No, no. Absolutely not.

38:23.620 --> 38:24.980
That'd be too dangerous.

38:26.860 --> 38:28.460
But you are angry...

38:30.620 --> 38:32.660
and you gotta
let it out somehow.

38:32.660 --> 38:36.140
So you find a guy--
an older guy--

38:37.860 --> 38:40.420
Maybe he reminds you
a little of your dad.

38:42.420 --> 38:45.300
Let me guess.
I look like him?

38:45.300 --> 38:47.060
You don't look
anything like him.

38:47.060 --> 38:48.660
If you say so.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.300
But you gotta let
that anger out somehow.

38:52.340 --> 38:55.420
And I seem like a good target--
Will you shut up?

38:55.420 --> 38:57.020
Seriously, just shut up!

38:57.060 --> 38:59.300
You know nothing about me.

38:59.300 --> 39:02.700
No, you're right.
So sit down and tell me.

39:02.700 --> 39:04.140
We'll talk.

39:05.860 --> 39:08.100
Yeah, right.
We can sit on the sofa.

39:08.100 --> 39:10.580
And I'll call a taxi for you.

39:10.580 --> 39:12.300
If you want, I'll hold you.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.860
If you don't want,
I'll keep my distance.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.740
You can let it all out.

39:17.780 --> 39:20.460
If you need to cry,
if you need to scream.

39:20.460 --> 39:22.340
Whatever you need, Hayley.

39:27.860 --> 39:30.100
You wouldn't be mad at me?

39:31.980 --> 39:34.860
I just want you to look
at what you're doing.

39:44.540 --> 39:46.980
I just wanna ask, um...

39:55.860 --> 39:57.020
Did you...

39:57.020 --> 40:00.460
Did you seriously think
that that was gonna work?

40:02.660 --> 40:04.820
You're good at what
you do, Jeff.

40:04.820 --> 40:07.900
What you do is work with teenage
girls, put them at ease

40:07.940 --> 40:10.340
so they can trust you
with all their secrets.

40:10.340 --> 40:12.220
No, that's not
what I was doing.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.940
Janelle's birthday.

40:31.860 --> 40:34.020
Janelle's phone number.

40:38.940 --> 40:40.620
Janelle's phone
number backwards.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.700
You're an honor student.

40:46.700 --> 40:49.180
Try every possible
combination of numbers.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.380
Should only take you
the rest of the week,

40:51.380 --> 40:53.500
if you figure in breaks
for meals.

40:57.980 --> 40:59.180
Or I--

40:59.180 --> 41:02.700
Or I could just try
March 19th.

41:06.580 --> 41:08.780
March 19th.
First with Janelle.

41:11.140 --> 41:14.900
What's this, Jeff?
You are lensman319 after all.

41:14.900 --> 41:16.380
Was this the first photo
session

41:16.420 --> 41:18.220
or the first time
you banged her?

41:18.220 --> 41:19.940
Or was that the same thing?

41:22.260 --> 41:24.660
Hm. What year would
that have been?

41:26.980 --> 41:28.420
3-19-87?

41:32.340 --> 41:33.380
Nope.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.860
3-19-89?

41:44.220 --> 41:46.620
How sentimental you are.

41:56.260 --> 41:58.900
What's so special
about these photos?

42:01.780 --> 42:03.260
Oh...

42:11.100 --> 42:14.940
This is what they make
those federal laws for, Jeff.

42:19.220 --> 42:21.500
This is officially sick.

42:27.540 --> 42:29.940
What makes this girl
so special?

42:33.420 --> 42:34.540
Hmm?

42:34.540 --> 42:37.100
Why does she get
to keep her clothes on?

42:56.620 --> 42:58.340
I recognize this girl.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.620
Hayley?

43:48.580 --> 43:49.820
Where are you?

44:47.660 --> 44:49.340
Oh, fuck!

45:21.980 --> 45:23.620
Welcome back.

45:24.660 --> 45:27.860
I'm sorry to expose
you like this.

45:27.860 --> 45:30.140
It's not about sex,
although I have to admit...

45:31.300 --> 45:32.460
you are built.

45:38.700 --> 45:40.220
I never touched you.

45:41.380 --> 45:43.980
I was trying
to hold you off me

45:43.980 --> 45:46.180
while I called the cops.

45:46.180 --> 45:47.740
Would you have shown them this?

45:49.500 --> 45:53.340
Why do you have a picture
of Donna Mauer in your safe?

45:53.340 --> 45:56.220
And have you seen her,
because no one else has?

46:04.700 --> 46:06.740
I did meet Donna for coffee.

46:07.740 --> 46:10.300
I took a shot of her
to make her happy.

46:12.860 --> 46:14.900
So how happy did you make her?

46:14.900 --> 46:17.580
Look at her.
She's fully dressed.

46:17.580 --> 46:20.420
You can see the coffee
shop behind her.

46:20.420 --> 46:23.020
I never brought her home.

46:23.060 --> 46:25.100
So, what?
You just said,

46:25.100 --> 46:27.820
"See you later, kid.
It's been fun."

46:29.700 --> 46:33.300
You could have
thrown this away.

46:33.300 --> 46:34.860
You didn't.

46:34.900 --> 46:36.740
You needed to hang on to it.

46:38.220 --> 46:40.540
You could have talked
to the police.

46:40.540 --> 46:42.260
You're right.
Yeah.

46:42.260 --> 46:44.580
Or maybe you had
something to hide,

46:44.580 --> 46:47.340
like the extensive
kiddy porn collect--

46:47.340 --> 46:50.260
Look. I'm not the monster
you think I am.

46:51.580 --> 46:54.980
But okay, I...crossed a line.

46:56.140 --> 46:58.500
Just call the cops.
I'll turn myself in.

47:00.540 --> 47:03.380
A cute pedophile
pleads guilty.

47:04.380 --> 47:06.500
"But, oh, it's not his fault.

47:06.500 --> 47:08.740
He's sick.
He has an addiction."

47:08.740 --> 47:10.820
I'll do jail. Isn't that
what should happen?

47:10.820 --> 47:12.860
Yeah, you might.
You might get jail time.

47:12.900 --> 47:15.460
I don't know--
Therapy, drugs,

47:15.460 --> 47:16.700
group discussions,

47:16.700 --> 47:19.020
notifying people when you
move into a new house.

47:19.060 --> 47:22.180
How bad is that, really?
It'll ruin my career, my life.

47:22.180 --> 47:24.620
Didn't Roman Polanski
just win an Oscar?

47:27.820 --> 47:29.260
So why the ice?

47:37.500 --> 47:39.580
I read the psych profile

47:39.580 --> 47:41.740
about the person
who took Donna Mauer.

47:41.780 --> 47:43.700
Said he's a loner.

47:43.700 --> 47:46.020
Thinks he's pretty damn bright

47:46.020 --> 47:48.060
and as powerful
as a teenage girl.

47:48.060 --> 47:50.980
He's gonna strike again.
Kind of sounds a lot like you.

47:50.980 --> 47:51.980
It's not me!

47:52.020 --> 47:53.900
Maybe not, but...

47:54.900 --> 47:57.220
Those photos that I found

47:57.220 --> 48:00.820
and the way you
let me get drunk--

48:03.900 --> 48:05.820
You're a headline
waiting to happen.

48:11.100 --> 48:12.620
Everybody will be safer

48:12.620 --> 48:15.140
if I do a little
preventive maintenance.

48:22.060 --> 48:25.380
What the fuck are you doing?
I have to shave you down here.

48:25.380 --> 48:27.740
I can't have any hair
on the incision site, right?

48:27.740 --> 48:29.260
What?

48:29.260 --> 48:32.060
I've been going in my dad's
medical library at school

48:32.100 --> 48:36.500
and, um, well, you said
I was pretty bright, right?

48:36.500 --> 48:38.300
I think I'm smart enough
to perform

48:38.300 --> 48:39.820
a successful castration.

48:39.820 --> 48:41.020
No!

48:41.020 --> 48:43.180
Please.
No! Ow!

48:43.180 --> 48:45.860
Okay, okay. I guess you're
not numb enough yet.

48:49.020 --> 48:51.980
What should we talk about
while we're waiting?

48:51.980 --> 48:54.540
"Dear Janelle.
My name is Hayley Stark.

48:54.540 --> 48:56.940
"I hope you don't mind me
writing you like this.

48:56.940 --> 49:00.620
"I met this guy that I think
you know-- Jeff Kohlver.

49:00.660 --> 49:02.420
"He's so cute.

49:02.420 --> 49:04.780
"Well, he seems
to really like me.

49:04.820 --> 49:07.900
"He even asked me over to his
place to do some photography,

49:07.940 --> 49:10.180
"and I am so excited about this

49:10.180 --> 49:12.580
"because, well,
for a 14-year-old like me,

49:12.580 --> 49:14.860
this could be
a huge break, you know?"

49:16.380 --> 49:21.140
And here I put in a little
smiley face icon.

49:22.660 --> 49:25.460
"Thing is, and I've tried
to pretend this isn't the case,

49:25.460 --> 49:27.540
"but he talks about
you an awful lot,

49:27.540 --> 49:31.300
"and I have this ooky feeling
he's still in love with you.

49:31.300 --> 49:32.940
"I'm pretty sweet on him too,

49:32.980 --> 49:36.060
"but I don't want to go crazy
over him if there's some chance

49:36.060 --> 49:38.580
"that you two might
get back together.

49:38.580 --> 49:40.300
"So, so, so, so,

49:40.340 --> 49:42.300
"I found your e-mail
address in his PDA,

49:42.300 --> 49:44.580
"and I thought I'd just ask.

49:45.660 --> 49:47.020
"Is this insane?

49:48.580 --> 49:50.340
"Am I insane?

49:51.580 --> 49:52.620
"Is Jeff?

49:55.220 --> 49:58.300
"And this other girl
he talks about all the time.

49:58.300 --> 50:00.740
"Her name is... Donna Mauer.

50:02.860 --> 50:04.940
"Do you know anything
about her?

50:06.100 --> 50:08.100
"I found these photos
on his computer

50:08.100 --> 50:10.300
"but I can't figure out
how to open them,

50:10.300 --> 50:11.980
"but I'm attaching them
to this note.

50:11.980 --> 50:15.180
"Are they pictures
of you or Donna?

50:16.740 --> 50:18.060
"Anyhoo, thanks a mil.

50:18.100 --> 50:21.340
"Your complete honesty
will be "mucho" appreciated.

50:21.340 --> 50:23.300
Love and peace, Hayley."

50:28.460 --> 50:30.140
I tried to make
it sound as innocent

50:30.180 --> 50:31.500
and moronic
as possible.

50:31.500 --> 50:33.020
How do you think I did?

50:37.500 --> 50:38.860
Fine.

50:38.900 --> 50:41.820
Guess I'll just send it
and that'll be that.

50:43.340 --> 50:46.020
You're getting yourself
in terrible trouble.

50:46.020 --> 50:48.220
Oh, and how's that?

50:49.980 --> 50:52.860
If you cut me in any way,
you won't forget it.

50:52.900 --> 50:55.820
It changes you when
you hurt somebody.

50:55.820 --> 50:57.980
And you speak from
experience, I guess.

50:58.020 --> 50:59.540
I've just lived.

51:00.540 --> 51:02.300
Unlike you.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.180
The things you do wrong--

51:06.620 --> 51:08.300
They haunt you.

51:09.540 --> 51:11.420
Tell me what you're haunted by.

51:13.100 --> 51:15.580
You wanna remember this day
when you're with a guy

51:15.620 --> 51:16.860
on a date?

51:16.860 --> 51:19.060
Or on your wedding night?

51:19.060 --> 51:21.100
'Cause I promise you,
you will.

51:22.100 --> 51:23.900
Don't do that to yourself.

51:26.140 --> 51:27.420
Wow.

51:29.060 --> 51:30.820
You know,
that is so thoughtful.

51:30.820 --> 51:32.820
You are speaking to me
so selflessly.

51:32.820 --> 51:35.380
I mean, you just don't
want me to castrate you

51:35.380 --> 51:37.900
for my own benefit?

51:37.900 --> 51:39.620
Wow, I'm touched.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.060
Jeff.

51:44.060 --> 51:46.940
Why don't we imagine someone
saying the same thing to you

51:46.940 --> 51:48.620
at a random moment?

51:50.660 --> 51:54.380
Imagine that, when you
downloaded this little girl...

51:57.180 --> 51:58.980
I was sitting
by your side saying,

51:58.980 --> 52:00.900
"Stop. Don't do that
to yourself."

52:02.220 --> 52:03.820
Would you have listened?

52:08.140 --> 52:09.420
Stop.

52:12.540 --> 52:14.540
Don't do that to yourself.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.660
Stop.

52:21.180 --> 52:23.220
Don't do that to yourself.

52:28.060 --> 52:29.340
Stop.

52:32.300 --> 52:33.260
Stop.

52:49.060 --> 52:51.100
You are good and numb,
aren't you?

52:51.100 --> 52:52.660
Fuck off.

52:52.660 --> 52:54.500
Your conversational skills

52:54.500 --> 52:56.540
are really deteriorating
as the day goes on.

52:58.340 --> 53:00.540
Seriously. It turns out
that castration

53:00.580 --> 53:03.260
is the easiest surgical
procedure around,

53:03.300 --> 53:04.940
and thousands of farm boys

53:04.940 --> 53:06.940
across the country
guild their own livestock.

53:06.940 --> 53:10.500
So I figure, if they can do it,
then I can pull it off,

53:10.500 --> 53:11.660
if you know what I mean.

53:11.700 --> 53:14.060
I'm not fucking livestock.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.820
You keep telling
yourself that, stud.

53:15.820 --> 53:17.660
Help!

53:17.700 --> 53:19.180
Help!

53:21.900 --> 53:23.340
Look, that wasn't necessary.

53:24.860 --> 53:26.180
You bitch.

53:26.180 --> 53:27.500
No more wiggling.

53:35.100 --> 53:38.900
Does your mother know
you cut off men's balls?

53:40.540 --> 53:43.740
I've never done it
before today, but...

53:44.780 --> 53:47.140
Maybe I'll tell her
when I get home,

53:47.140 --> 53:49.780
see what she says.

53:49.780 --> 53:52.140
"Hayley, I knew you needed
a science fair project,

53:52.180 --> 53:53.660
but really..."

53:53.660 --> 53:56.980
So you and your mom
are both whacked.

53:56.980 --> 53:58.860
I don't know.
That's that whole...

53:58.860 --> 54:01.340
nature versus nurture
question, isn't it?

54:03.860 --> 54:07.900
Was I born a cute, vindictive
little bitch or...

54:09.820 --> 54:12.500
did society make me that way?

54:12.500 --> 54:14.260
I go back and forth on that.

54:15.980 --> 54:18.780
I'll be done in a sec.
I'm almost done.

54:18.780 --> 54:21.260
There's money in the safe.

54:21.260 --> 54:23.780
So?
So you could take it.

54:23.780 --> 54:26.020
Take the camera equipment.
Take whatever you want!

54:26.020 --> 54:27.340
I am.

54:27.340 --> 54:31.620
You really can't talk me
out of this by bribing me, okay?

54:33.460 --> 54:35.740
How-- How can I?

54:35.740 --> 54:37.580
What? Talk me out of it?

54:39.020 --> 54:41.420
I don't know.
I haven't thought about that.

54:44.460 --> 54:45.700
You know what?

54:45.700 --> 54:48.100
I need to sterilize
this before we start.

54:49.140 --> 54:51.660
Do you want me to use
the vodka,

54:51.700 --> 54:54.660
or do you have another alcohol
you wanna offer me?

54:59.100 --> 55:00.220
Okay.

55:06.100 --> 55:08.260
Okay, all that scraping I did--

55:08.260 --> 55:09.980
The blood probably
rushed back in.

55:09.980 --> 55:12.740
I have to numb you out
a bit more, okay?

55:16.980 --> 55:18.340
I'll be right back.

56:45.500 --> 56:48.420
Can I call someone for you?
Is that what you--

56:50.300 --> 56:51.740
Oh, you're getting bored.

56:51.740 --> 56:55.100
Look, I'm sorry. We gotta get
this show on the road.

56:56.820 --> 57:00.660
Oh, it's actually
really impressive.

57:00.660 --> 57:04.060
I thought it would be fun
to see how far you could get,

57:04.060 --> 57:06.780
and I really only expected,
like, an inch or two.

57:06.820 --> 57:09.060
That's... not bad.

57:13.340 --> 57:15.900
Why don't you just kill me?

57:17.020 --> 57:18.980
Is that what you think I want?

57:23.380 --> 57:24.860
Isn't it?

57:25.900 --> 57:27.300
Close.

57:50.620 --> 57:52.660
I love that you have
all this stuff

57:52.660 --> 57:55.220
because, like, this way
you can watch, you know?

57:56.260 --> 57:57.500
Now I'm hurt.

57:57.500 --> 58:00.100
I go through all the trouble
to set this up

58:00.100 --> 58:03.020
and you don't even
want to watch?

58:08.460 --> 58:10.140
I just--

58:10.140 --> 58:14.180
I stayed one summer with my
Aunt Denise and her kids.

58:14.180 --> 58:16.860
You know, and her kids
were, like four or five,

58:16.860 --> 58:18.620
and I was, like, ten.

58:18.620 --> 58:21.140
No. No, I was nine.

58:21.140 --> 58:23.580
And the littlest one--

58:23.580 --> 58:26.260
the daughter, Lynnie...

58:26.260 --> 58:28.540
She...she loved me.

58:28.540 --> 58:31.740
So she had this--
she had this game

58:31.740 --> 58:36.340
where she would jump out of
the bathtub, all soaking wet...

58:37.420 --> 58:39.380
and she'd jump on top of me

58:39.380 --> 58:41.020
and she'd tickle me.

58:41.020 --> 58:43.700
And she'd tickle me
and she'd shout:

58:43.700 --> 58:45.500
"Prune attack!
Prune attack!"

58:45.500 --> 58:47.740
'cause her fingers
were all pruney.

58:50.420 --> 58:53.820
I-I-I couldn't do anything
'cause I was afraid I'd hurt her

58:53.820 --> 58:56.940
and it was... weird.

58:58.780 --> 59:03.020
And one day her mother
came in, in the middle of it...

59:05.020 --> 59:09.300
and she saw her daughter,
naked on top of me.

59:11.540 --> 59:15.980
And then...she yelled at her:

59:16.020 --> 59:19.260
"Lynnie, get back
in the bathtub."

59:22.220 --> 59:24.100
Then she took me by the hand...

59:25.180 --> 59:27.740
and she dragged me
to the kitchen.

59:30.220 --> 59:33.100
She turned the stove on.

59:33.100 --> 59:35.460
We stood there while
the burner got hot.

59:37.940 --> 59:40.380
And she pulled my pants down...

59:42.460 --> 59:46.540
and lifted me up
over the burner.

59:50.380 --> 59:54.700
I could feel the dirt
on my skin from her hands.

59:55.780 --> 59:58.260
She must have been gardening.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.020
And I cried and cried.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.620
And I could hear the tears
sizzle as they hit the burner.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.620
Then she sat me down.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.580
She said, "If I ever catch you
with my daughter again..."

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.660
She called my mom.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.620
My mom came the next day.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.420
I never saw Aunt Denise again.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.660
These things really stick.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.620
Okay, well, you know, we're set.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.380
Don't.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.140
I told you not
to use that word.

01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.140
Okay?

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.220
Hayley, please.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.700
You need help.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.300
A teenage girl
doesn't do this.

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.100
I've seen your idea of what
a teenage girl should do,

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.340
so don't even start.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.580
I'll pay for a therapist.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.540
Thanks.

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.820
Thanks, but if I ever
see a shrink--

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.660
I want to make my case...
Please.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.500
really, really
interesting for them.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.180
Please. I'll do
whatever you want.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.340
You could call the cops. I'll
say I did whatever you want.

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:28.260
I don't think they're gonna
believe a confession

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.540
under these circumstances.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.660
Then I'll leave.
I'll leave, okay? I'll move.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.300
Mm-hmm.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.740
Donna's body will still
be where you left it.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.300
I'm not the guy!

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:42.620
I'm not the guy, I swear!

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:45.060
Anything! Please!

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.700
Please don't do this!

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.620
Anything?
Anything! Piss on me!

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.980
Fucking feed me glass!
I don't care! Whatever you want!

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:55.820
I'll tell the cops I did
whatever you want. Please!

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.460
I'll do whatever you want.
Anything. Please.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.500
Please. Anything.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.940
Anything. Anything.

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.940
Please.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.340
Please!

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.660
Anything.
Yes.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.460
Yeah, anything. Just--

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.380
Oh, please.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.980
Please!

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.180
When I talked about sending
an email to Janelle,

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.780
you changed the subject.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.660
I could send it right now,
pack up and go.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.220
It could be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.500
You could stop
torturing yourself

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:48.500
with the idea that you might
get back with her someday.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.441
What do you say?

01:02:49.467 --> 01:02:52.380
Goddamn it!
Get the fuck off of me!

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.660
Please untie me and let me go!

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.420
Please! Please don't cut me!

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:00.380
Please! Please!

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:02.100
Please!

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.380
I shouldn't have teased
you like that.

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:38.080
I shouldn't have let you think
there was a way out of this.

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:47.020
Hey, um...

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:50.380
I got this medical text,

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.660
and if I forget anything
just don't panic.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.780
Okay, 'cause it's--
It's right here.

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.740
Yeah, I knew you'd
want to watch.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.780
Look, if you move too much,
I could...

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.420
knick the perineal artery
and you--

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:10.620
You could, like, bleed to death
before anyone got here, okay?

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:13.500
So, just, please.
I really need to have

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.140
a steady, steady hand, okay?

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.180
Jeff?

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.660
Do you feel that?

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:38.060
Why do you care?

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.420
I'd be thankful
for small favors.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.100
Wow.

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.220
Wow. That went well.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.620
You know, you told that, uh...

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:21.580
that Aunt Denise story
very well.

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.540
Very, very well.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.140
What was that supposed to be?

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.420
Some kind of magic key

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.260
to explain why you are
the way you are?

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.140
Doesn't.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:39.940
Okay. What should I do first?
Your right or left testicle?

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.500
Why don't we just
say right, okay?

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.740
All right, now, I just have
to give it

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.500
one little slice
to free it up,

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.020
and then, um...

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.100
Snip.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.500
Okay. Now I just need
to suture it up.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.980
This would be so much easier
if I had, like,

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.300
a nurse or something,

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.940
but, you know, I asked my friend
if she'd help me castrate a guy

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:10.700
and, well, she made all these,
like, ooky sounds,

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:14.100
like I was asking her
to swallow worms or something.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.940
We'll see who makes medical
school in eight years, huh?

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.820
All right, now, you're
gonna feel a tug,

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.460
'cause I really gotta get
this tight, all right?

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.380
So just...
bear with me.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:30.700
Okay...

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.780
Okay.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.940
Okay, halfway through.
Over the hump.

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:40.220
Can't you stop?

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:41.540
Please?

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.460
Some men,

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:47.380
they go through their whole
lives with only one ball,

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.180
and they're just fine,
you know?

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.860
Or so I've read.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.540
Well, I guess I figured that,

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.809
you're not really punished
if I leave you with a spare.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:03.180
Okay, stay with me.
Stay with me.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.540
It's okay.
It's okay, Jeff.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.060
If-if I left one,

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.420
then you'd be walking around
crooked all the time.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:17.580
Look, this is for the best,
all right?

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.020
Okay, you're entering
a whole new world now.

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.740
Just gotta...

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.940
snip and...

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:29.420
Okay.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.380
Wow.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.820
This seriously
has to be, like,

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.140
one of the easiest
operations, because...

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:41.660
Wow.

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.100
I wonder why they teach Girl
Scouts things like camping

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.900
and selling cookies.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.820
You know? 'Cause this
is what's really useful.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.780
I don't know how they'd
design a merit badge.

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.940
That'd be interesting.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:02.060
I saw Lynnie
at Aunt Denise's funeral.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.660
I told her what her mom did.

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.540
She didn't believe me.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.820
If Aunt Denise was here
right now, what would you say?

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.939
I'd say, "Help.

01:08:16.939 --> 01:08:19.819
A teenager cut my balls off.
Call the police."

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.500
She wasn't very sympathetic
the last time,

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.460
so I wouldn't really
hold your breath.

01:08:42.939 --> 01:08:44.859
All right.

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:47.939
I would cancel any appointments
you have in the next few days

01:08:47.939 --> 01:08:52.140
because you're going to be sorer
than you've ever been before.

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.979
Oh, I'd say, in, like,

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:55.819
eight or nine days,
take the stitches out,

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:58.420
which I suggest you do yourself

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.300
to save embarrassment.

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.580
Oh, and there's this website:
EunuchsQuestions.com.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.580
Eunuchs is e-u-n-u-c-h-s.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.740
I had a lot of trouble with that
but it gives great advice

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.580
on how to deal with
your castration.

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.939
You really--

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.100
You don't have to go through
this alone, you know?

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.180
Do you want some souvenirs?

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.500
No?

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.660
Okay.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.979
What should we do with them?

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:34.899
We could see how
far they bounce.

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.300
Actually...

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.060
we wouldn't want,
like, a little animal

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.420
confusing it for
an afternoon snack.

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.300
You know?
A little squirrelly

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.220
or a coyote might get sick.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.540
We don't want that,

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.700
especially with you being
such a conservationist.

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:03.260
We could grind them
up in the garbage disposal.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.340
Or-- or we could
sew them back in.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.980
I had this shop teacher once,

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.700
who sawed off
his thumb in class,

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.540
and then he grabbed some ice,

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.060
drove to the emergency room.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.940
The next day, sure enough,
he has this thumb.

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:23.060
Didn't bend so well, but he
could hitchhike and stuff.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.980
I'm just checking
to see if it works.

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.220
I guess they,
uh, weren't brass.

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.620
You're not laughing, are you?

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:01.660
Well, no wonder. This isn't
a laughing matter at all.

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.060
I don't know. Maybe Donna's
smiling just a tad.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.740
I didn't do anything to her.

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.660
Maybe, maybe not.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:19.580
But I suggest you track down
the guy who did...

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:22.140
'cause he has no idea
what's waiting for him.

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.220
Here.

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.780
You really need to rehydrate.

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.940
Jeff. Please.
Come on.

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.420
Jeff, I'm serious.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.860
You really, really need
to drink this, okay?

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:43.220
Come on.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.020
Attaboy.

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.620
Do you want more?

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.140
Why are you being
so nice to me now?

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.940
You're pitiful now,
aren't you?

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.220
I mean, it's going
to be tricky,

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.100
not letting anyone
find out about...

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.420
No more sex.

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:13.700
No more taking public showers.

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.860
But one of these days
you're going to get a physical,

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.900
and your doctor's going
to find out.

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:23.380
And don't worry. He's not going
to tell his golf buddies,

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.140
and they're not gonna
tell their friends,

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.340
and they're not
gonna tell their friends.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:31.660
But a couple years down the road
you're going to start wondering,

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.580
"Do your publishers know?"

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.460
"Do your models know?"

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.020
"Does Janelle know?"

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.580
God, I'm sweating.

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.460
Look, I'll go take a shower

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.100
and then I'll be out
of your life, okay?

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.780
I'll find you.

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.580
Don't make threats while
you're still tied down.

01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.499
I'm just saying--

01:12:59.525 --> 01:13:01.660
What do you expect
me to do about it?

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.180
I'm just saying.

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.700
The easiest thing for me to do

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.580
would be to just kill you.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.380
But I already told you
I'm not going to do that.

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:21.900
You don't get off
that easy, Jeff.

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:27.780
I'm sweating
like a pig. Seriously.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.300
Um...I gotta go have a shower,

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:34.700
and then when I come back later,
maybe we can chat some more.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.660
I'm all here.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.420
I'm all here.

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.940
<i>Why you can see it
with your very own eyes.</i>

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:22.380
Come on. Come on.

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.420
No!

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:17.340
Fuck.

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.740
Hey, Trace.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.900
Look, I'm gonna be done, like,
so much sooner than I thought,

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.420
so do you wanna
catch a movie or something?

01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:59.780
Cool.

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.940
No, I'm not telling you.

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.980
Yes, this is Lieutenant
Hayley, L.A.P.D.

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.700
You're acquainted
with a photographer,

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.460
one Jeffrey Kohlver?

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.660
Yes, there's been
an incident here.

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:33.900
Is it possible that
you can assist us?

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.780
I'm not at liberty to discuss
that at this moment, ma'am,

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.340
but it's a very
delicate matter

01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.740
and the sooner we
can speak with you here,

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.380
the better chance we have
of keeping it out of the papers.

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:49.780
We appreciate that.

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:51.420
The address--

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:55.740
Yes.

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:57.580
Yes, that's the place.

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.980
How soon do you think
you can be here?

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:45.780
Steady.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.820
Stand straight.

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:48.860
Attaboy.

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:07.220
You're insane.
Right.

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:12.100
Which I did tell you
when we first met, remember?

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.500
"Four out of five
doctors agree..."

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.620
Maybe I should ask
my therapist.

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.340
See what she thinks
about it.

01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:23.373
Ask her much it would
cost to get a padded ce--

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.700
Help!

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:32.260
Shut up!

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:35.980
Hi.

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:38.180
Oh, hello.
Is Mr. Kohlver here?

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:41.380
Um, he's asleep.
Not feeling so well.

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.340
I think it's food poisoning.

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.020
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.580
Are you--

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.700
I'm his niece.

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.380
Oh, really?

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.460
Can I ask you something?

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:55.580
Okay.

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.260
I might be a little
out of line here.

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.580
Do you babysit?

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.620
Yeah, yeah.
I do. I do.

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:08.300
But I'm only here for, like,
a couple more days.

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.820
Oh, that's too bad.

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:12.300
I'm on a constant patrol
for new babysitters.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.500
Right.

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.740
Are those--
Oh...

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:18.500
Yes. Mr. Kohlver's cookies.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.820
My daughter's a Girl Scout

01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.620
and we've been trying
to deliver these,

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.100
but we've always been
missing him,

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.500
so here they are,
yummy stuff.

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.380
Thanks.

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.420
Yeah. Uncle Jeff loves
his Girl Scouts, so...

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:34.820
You should probably--
What?

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.940
Well, pay me.

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.100
Right. Yeah. I'm sorry.
How much is it?

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.460
Six.
Six.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.740
Can you just wait here
for a second?

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.100
No problem. Sure.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:05.180
Here you go.

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.100
Did I hear something?

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.860
The food poisoning.
He's... vomiting and...

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:14.180
I'm so sorry.

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.780
Your cookies.
Thanks.

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:19.220
And if you're going
to be around any longer,

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.700
I'm just-- I'm three
houses down, across.

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:24.580
I can always, always,
always use a new sitter.

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.660
I wish I could, but...
Yeah, me too.

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.940
Well...

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:30.820
So how's the roof?

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:34.540
S-Sorry?

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.300
You were on the roof.

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.420
I was.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.860
Just a little while ago I was
trimming my roses and looked up

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:46.300
and I saw you there
and I was wondering who it was.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.900
Ah, yeah, we--
There's, uh..

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:52.180
We had a leak
and I...

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.860
thought I'd go up and check.

01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:57.180
Your uncle made you
go up on the roof?

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.700
Well...

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.500
he's... sick

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:04.020
and I said I'd go and see
if there's, like--

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:05.500
A hole or--
Right.

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.420
Did it rain?

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:16.500
I have to go back to my uncle.

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.300
Oh, sure. No problem.

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.860
Just tell him Judy Tokuda
said hello.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:22.180
You bet.
Okay?

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:23.420
Thanks.

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:31.180
Well...it's "yummy stuff."

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:32.540
A leak?

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.620
That's all you could
come up with? Pathetic.

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:39.740
Don't piss me off right
now, Uncle Jeff.

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.540
You know, she'll be back.

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.140
She thinks you're flakey.

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.860
You might need help...
putting it fucking mildly.

01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:50.620
When you got loose...

01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:53.540
did you call the police,
did you run for help,

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:54.980
like an innocent
person would?

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.660
I did call.
Oh, yeah?

01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:01.660
Why don't we just
press redial and see?

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.740
Face it, Jeff.

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:09.900
You could have gotten away
and you didn't.

01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:13.660
Now it's so easy.

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:17.900
I leave you here,

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.220
someone will find you...

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.540
along with the photo of Donna

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:27.060
and the confession that
I typed on your computer.

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:29.220
Or...

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:32.940
I have a special time,
limited offer.

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.340
You step off that chair,
you end it all,

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.460
I destroy all the evidence.

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:41.940
No one will ever know
why you killed yourself,

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:43.740
not even Janelle.

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:45.820
I didn't kill Donna Mauer.

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.380
We've been over this.
Fuck you. I'm not gonna beg.

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:50.380
You mean you're not going
to beg again?

01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:52.380
Because you do it so well.

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:53.900
Please.

01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:57.140
Please, pretty please,

01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.740
with a cherry on top.

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.820
One that you just had to pop.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:07.940
You'll leave a clue.

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.060
You've messed up
once already,

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.700
more than once.

01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.980
Mrs. Tokuda's made you.

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.260
She's figured you out.

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.700
They'll find you.

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:21.260
They might.
No. They will.

01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:24.580
You'll spend the rest of your
life lookin' over your shoulder.

01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:27.820
Waking up, in the middle
of the night,

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:29.700
jumping at every noise.

01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:37.660
How hard do you think they're
going to look for me, really?

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.060
I mean, they find
a pedophile killer,

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:41.420
all gift wrapped for them.

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.500
Think they're gonna care
who did the work?

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.620
Think they're even
gonna bring it up?

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:49.900
And I will have the biggest
legal defense you ever saw.

01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:53.540
If everyone who's ever
molested sends me $5,

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.500
oh, come on, I'll be
able to afford

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.740
the best fucking lawyer
in the world.

01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:00.860
Worst case scenario:

01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:04.340
two years of community service?

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.940
Jody Foster directs the movie
version of the whole thing.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.780
Who do you want to play you?

01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.940
You didn't leave, did ya?

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.820
No.

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:14.660
You don't wanna
leave me...

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.700
do ya?

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:28.660
Where are ya?

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.940
We've spent too much time
only to walk away.

01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:36.420
I know you're not gonna leave.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.220
Come on!

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:42.300
I'll make it good for you,
I promise!

01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.380
Oh, you're good.

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:30.020
You're so fucking good!

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:31.300
You're just like her!

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.460
You're all just fucking
like her!

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:35.660
You wanna drive a man
fucking crazy,

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:38.140
then go ahead, until you go out
of your fucking mind!

01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:41.100
Then go-- Go on
your fucking way!

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:44.420
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.780
Go!

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:51.980
You're right.

01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:53.740
You're right, Hayley.

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:56.340
Thank you. Thank you.

01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.060
This is me.

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:01.180
This is who I am.

01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:02.340
Thank you.

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.220
Thank you for
helping me see it.

01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:55.020
What took you so long?

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:57.420
You dropped this.
I had to.

01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:57.772
Yeah?

01:29:57.798 --> 01:29:59.180
You would have been
down there forever.

01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:00.540
Were you jerkin' off?

01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:03.132
Which do you wanna fuck
first, me or the knife?

01:30:03.158 --> 01:30:03.780
Uh-uh.

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:07.820
You know how to use that?
Honor student, remember?

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.940
Nothing I can't do
when I put my mind to it.

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.620
Toss the knife in the backyard!

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:18.740
Why?

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.860
Or you'll shoot again?
Go on, shoot me.

01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:22.380
You're not gonna shoot me!

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.500
It's not me you have to worry
about. It's Janelle.

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.460
I called her.

01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:32.460
Told her I was Lieutenant Hayley
from the L.A.P.D.

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.140
How far does she live, Jeff?

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.700
Look over there.

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:41.180
Look over there!

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.500
The deal's still open.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.940
You put the noose around your
neck, you end this whole game.

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:54.300
I will still clean up
all the evidence.

01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.500
You're running out of time!

01:30:57.860 --> 01:30:59.820
Or we can wait for her.

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:04.220
I'll pull off my clothes,

01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:07.460
and I will run into her arms.

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:09.340
What? Unless I hang myself?

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.780
I'll find you.
I'll track you down!

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.460
Assuming you knew
anything about me.

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.300
Calabasas girl
who's dad teaches at UCW

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:19.660
shouldn't be
that hard to find.

01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.780
You believed all that? Huh?

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.860
Who are you?

01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.620
It's hard to say for sure.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:35.060
Maybe not a Calabasas girl.

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:37.340
Maybe not the daughter
of a med school professor.

01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:40.940
Maybe not even a friend of Donna Mauer.
Maybe not even named Hayley.

01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:48.340
Who the hell are you?

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:54.060
I am every little girl
you ever watched...

01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:57.900
touched, hurt,

01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.780
screwed, killed.

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.700
She's gonna find it, Jeff.
No.

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.180
She's gonna find it all.

01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:24.380
Put on the noose
and jump and I'll stop it.

01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:29.460
She'll never find out.

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.860
She'll just think
you were some sad man

01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.980
who she never
should have left.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.180
Jeff?

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.340
Bad things--

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.060
Fucking awful things

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:50.260
will happen to you in prison.
This is the only way.

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:51.660
You'll wish you'd
killed yourself

01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:53.020
when you had the chance;
it's the only way.

01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:56.860
It's the only way, Jeff.

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:05.500
Jeff!

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.340
I didn't kill her.

01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.060
I just watched.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:34.780
I wanted to take pictures...

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:38.380
but he wouldn't let me.

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:41.100
It was me and another guy.

01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:43.140
I didn't do it. I swear.

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:44.900
I'll tell you the name,

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:47.180
and I'll help you find him.

01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:48.780
I'll help you find him.

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.340
I know his name.

01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:58.140
I know his name, Jeff.

01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:03.100
You know what's funny?

01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:08.660
Jeff?

01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:13.860
Aaron told me you did it
before he killed himself.

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.260
It was him. It wasn't me.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:23.380
Jeff.

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.060
I don't care.

01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.220
Jeff?

01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:28.260
Don't worry.

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:30.540
I promise I'll take
care of it all.

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:01.820
Or not.

01:36:02.305 --> 01:36:08.653
