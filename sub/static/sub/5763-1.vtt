00:03.400 --> 00:06.000
Melinda: THERE'S A DOOR IN THE
ARCHIVES THAT LEADS TO THE TUNNELS.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.600
WAIT A MINUTE,
ARE YOU SAYING

00:09.600 --> 00:10.900
WHAT I THINK YOU'RE SAYING?

00:12.100 --> 00:13.500
LET'S HAVE A BABY.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.500
OH! OH, GOD,
I LOVE YOU.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.500
Melinda: WHAT?

00:18.500 --> 00:19.900
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.900
THERE'S SIX OF US, BUT
THERE'S ONLY FIVE SHADOWS.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.600
ARE YOU OK?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.300
PROMISE ME SOMETHING.
ANYTHING.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.600
THAT NO MATTER
HOW LONG IT TAKES,

00:54.600 --> 00:57.500
WE NEVER STOP TRYING
TO GET PREGNANT.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.600
I PROMISE.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.700
OK. EVEN AFTER WE'RE PREGNANT,
WE HAVE TO KEEP TRYING.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.500
CHECK THE FINE PRINT. I THINK
IT'S IN THE WEDDING VOWS.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.400
COME ON.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.000
DO YOU THINK
THAT DELIA NOTICED

01:08.000 --> 01:09.700
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY WINE
WITH DINNER TONIGHT?

01:09.700 --> 01:11.500
NO. I DON'T THINK
SHE DID.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.800
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TELL HER WE'RE TRYING.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.300
SHE IS YOUR BEST
FRIEND, HUH?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.400
IT'S JUST SUCH
A LETDOWN, YOU KNOW?

01:18.400 --> 01:20.300
EVERY TIME IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN, I-

01:20.300 --> 01:21.700
I DON'T WANT
TO LET HER DOWN, TOO.

01:21.700 --> 01:22.900
HEY, IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.300
WE'VE ONLY BEEN
TRYING 4 MONTHS.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.100
I KNOW.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.200
OH, NO.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.800
CLANCY, YEAH.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.300
RIGHT. OK.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.100
I'LL BE THERE
IN 5 MINUTES.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.600
THERE'S A MULTIPLE VICTIM
FIRE AT ROCKLAND UNIVERSITY,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.300
ONE OF THE OFFICE
BUILDINGS.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.800
DID THEY WHICH
OFFICE BUILDING?

01:44.900 --> 01:46.600
NO.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.400
Jim: HONEY, I'M GONNA GO
CHECK WITH THE COMMANDER.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.800
Melinda: EXCUSE ME,
HAVE YOU SEEN RICK PAYNE?

02:02.900 --> 02:04.500
PROFESSOR PAYNE?

02:05.200 --> 02:06.600
HEY, WHAT DO WE GOT?

02:06.700 --> 02:08.400
HAS ANYONE SEEN RICK PAYNE?

02:08.400 --> 02:11.000
I HAVE, BUT USUALLY WHEN I'M
STANDING IN FRONT OF A MIRROR.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.900
YOU'RE OK.
YEAH.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.500
I'M MORE THAN OK. I MEAN,
ASK AROUND. YOU'LL HEAR THAT-

02:14.600 --> 02:16.800
SO WHY THE HELL DIDN'T
YOU ANSWER YOUR PHONE?!

02:16.900 --> 02:19.300
MELINDA, I TALKED YOU ON
THE TELEPHONE AN HOUR AGO!

02:19.300 --> 02:20.800
I TALKED TO YOU
INSIDE MY HOME.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.700
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT I WAS IN THAT BUILDING?

02:22.700 --> 02:24.600
GET THE PADDLES
READY.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.800
OH. THE SHADOW THING.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.500
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS
A BAD OMEN, HUH?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.000
YOU THOUGHT
MY NUMBER WAS UP.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.500
BUT I'M OK.
I'M HERE.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.700
I SHOULD HAVE
CALLED YOU.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.900
THAT'S WHAT A FRIEND
WOULD HAVE DONE.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.500
A FRIEND WOULD HAVE
DONE MORE THAN THAT.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.000
Jim: CHARGING.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.900
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
CLEAR.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.400
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.200
LET'S TRY 200.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.100
CLEAR.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.400
NOTHING. GIVE ME 360.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.600
Jim: CLEAR.
CLEAR.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.500
Jim: I SEE LIFE.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.100
YES, WE GOT HIM.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.400
YEAH, HE'S RESPONSIVE.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.000
I SEE LIFE.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.400
THAT'S WHAT I SEE.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.500
CHECK HIS BLOOD
PRESSURE, HUH?

03:08.500 --> 03:11.200
Man: PLEASE, HELP ME OUT.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.000
CONGRATULATIONS
ON SAVING THAT GUY.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.700
NICE JOB.
WELL DONE.

03:41.450 --> 03:42.300
HI.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.700
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.800
EVER SINCE HE REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.100
WHO IS HE?

03:47.200 --> 03:48.900
HIS NAME'S
ELI JAMES.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.400
HE'S A PSYCHOLOGY
PROFESSOR

03:50.400 --> 03:52.200
WITH A THERAPY PRACTICE
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.600
HIS OFFICE WAS IN THE
BUILDING THAT BURNED.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.100
ARE HIS EYES OK?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.600
YEAH, IT'S JUST SWELLING
FROM THE SMOKE.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.700
HE'S FINE.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.300
HOW LONG HAS HE LIVED
IN GRANDVIEW?

04:00.400 --> 04:03.000
I DON'T KNOW. WHY?

04:09.100 --> 04:11.100
AND SO IT CAUGHT ME,
LIKE, HORRIFICALLY,

04:11.200 --> 04:12.900
AND THEN I-
HI...

04:12.900 --> 04:16.100
ELI, MY NAME
IS MELINDA GORDON.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.500
OH, UH...

04:17.600 --> 04:19.399
SORRY IF I DON'T
GET UP.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.800
THIS IS MY FRIEND FIONA.

04:20.899 --> 04:23.500
HI.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.400
NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.600
SHOULD I KNOW
THAT NAME?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.200
WE'VE NEVER MET BEFORE,

04:28.300 --> 04:30.900
WHICH IS... ODD,
IN A WAY.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.100
WHY? ARE YOU IN
THE PSYCH DEPARTMENT?

04:33.100 --> 04:34.300
NO.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.700
GAMBLER'S ANONYMOUS?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.900
NO.
WAIT.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.600
IF YOU'RE THAT GIRL FROM
THE ELECTRIC SHOCK STUDY,

04:40.700 --> 04:41.700
THOSE ELECTRODES
WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO-

04:41.800 --> 04:44.100
OK, IT'S OK, ELI,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.000
I UNDERSTAND. I...

04:47.100 --> 04:48.800
I CAN TALK TO THEM, TOO.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.100
TALK TO WHO?

04:50.200 --> 04:52.100
GHOSTS.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.000
IF YOU WORK
IN THE HOSPITAL,

04:57.100 --> 05:00.000
THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT
POST-TRAUMA COUNSELING PROTOCOL.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.700
NO ONE TOLD YOU.
TOLD ME WHAT?

05:01.700 --> 05:04.700
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S REALLY BETTER IF I-

05:04.700 --> 05:06.300
TOLD ME WHAT?

05:08.600 --> 05:11.200
ELI, FIONA DIED

05:11.200 --> 05:13.100
IN THAT FIRE WITH YOU.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.800
THEY COULDN'T BRING HER BACK,
I'M SO SORRY.

05:24.800 --> 05:25.900
WHERE'S FIONA?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.500
I JUST TOLD YOU.

05:29.122 --> 05:30.200
SHE'S DEAD.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.100
THEN WHO WAS I
TALKING TO?

05:34.200 --> 05:36.900
YOU WERE TALKING
TO HER GHOST.

Ghost Whisperer   S04E01</font>

06:13.700 --> 06:15.200
SO DO YOU THINK HE'S
ANOTHER ONE LIKE YOU?

06:15.400 --> 06:16.600
AND THAT'S WHAT
BROUGHT HIM TO GRANDVIEW,

06:16.700 --> 06:18.900
LIKE YOUR MOM AND GABRIEL
AND ALL THOSE OTHERS?

06:19.450 --> 06:20.200
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:20.550 --> 06:21.850
THERE'S SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM.

06:21.950 --> 06:24.350
I DON'T THINK HE'S HERE
FOR THE SAME REASONS I AM.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.050
AND I'M GUESSING
THAT YOU'RE WISHING

06:27.150 --> 06:28.750
I WOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT NED INTO THIS.

06:28.850 --> 06:31.150
NO, I-I WISH I KNEW
HOW TO PARTICIPATE,

06:31.250 --> 06:34.050
BUT IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SPEAKING
SOME STRANGE FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

06:34.150 --> 06:36.750
I UNDERSTAND THE WORDS,
BUT IT ALL...

06:36.850 --> 06:38.650
ADDS UP TO GIBBERISH.

06:40.350 --> 06:41.750
SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE GHOST?

06:41.750 --> 06:42.950
SHE WAS ONE OF HIS PATIENTS.

06:43.050 --> 06:44.350
THEY WERE CAUGHT
IN THE FIRE TOGETHER.

06:44.450 --> 06:46.850
HE WAS REVIVED.
I WISH I KNEW MORE.

06:46.950 --> 06:49.750
YEAH, LIKE WHAT THEY WERE DOING
TOGETHER IN HIS OFFICE AT 10 P.M.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.450
WELL, THAT PART
I UNDERSTOOD.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.250
Melinda: HEY.

06:58.450 --> 07:00.250
MIND IF I COME IN?

07:00.250 --> 07:02.750
MELINDA, HEY.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.250
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

07:04.350 --> 07:05.850
<i>YOU'RE ASKING ME THAT?</i>

07:05.950 --> 07:07.950
YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE GHOST PROBLEM.

07:07.950 --> 07:10.650
NO, I'M THE ONE WITH
POST TRAUMATIC STRESS.

07:10.750 --> 07:14.150
I LOST A PATIENT,
AND IN CASE YOU FORGOT,

07:14.150 --> 07:15.550
I KINDA DIED.

07:15.550 --> 07:18.450
IT TAKES A LOT LESS TO MAKE
SOMEONE THINK YOU HEARD VOICES.

07:18.450 --> 07:20.150
SOUNDS VERY RATIONAL.

07:20.150 --> 07:23.750
LOOK, IF THIS IS A CRY
FOR HELP, I CAN HELP YOU-

07:23.850 --> 07:25.850
WITH YOUR DEPRESSION,
YOUR ANXIETY.

07:25.950 --> 07:27.850
EVEN YOUR SELF-ESTEEM
ISSUES.

07:27.950 --> 07:30.050
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,

07:30.050 --> 07:32.050
I DON'T DO WELL WITH
YOUR TYPE OF NUT JOB.

07:32.150 --> 07:33.750
MY TYPE OF NUT JOB?

07:33.750 --> 07:36.950
YEAH. BIZARRE BELIEFS,
SUPERSTITIOUS BEHAVIOR.

07:37.050 --> 07:40.550
PEOPLE USE THAT TO HIDE
FROM THEIR REAL PROBLEMS, OK?

07:40.650 --> 07:43.550
I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE,
YOU MIGHT SAY.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.350
WOW. IS THIS THE KIND
OF BEDSIDE MANNER

07:46.350 --> 07:47.950
THAT THEY'RE TEACHING
THESE DAYS?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.350
I'M SORRY.

07:49.450 --> 07:51.350
I LIKE
TO KEEP IT REAL.

07:51.450 --> 07:54.350
SO I TAKE IT YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN ANYMORE GHOSTS?

07:54.350 --> 07:56.450
SAFE ASSUMPTION.
THAT'S A LIE!

07:56.550 --> 07:59.750
REALLY? YOU CAN SEE
THROUGH MY EYES?

07:59.850 --> 08:02.550
YOU'RE A MIND READER NOW?

08:02.550 --> 08:04.150
YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.350
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH,
I'M LYING,

08:05.450 --> 08:07.850
MAKE UP YOUR MIND, LADY.

08:07.850 --> 08:10.050
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM,
BUT YOU CAN HEAR THEM.

08:13.150 --> 08:15.350
SAY THAT AGAIN.

08:15.350 --> 08:17.750
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM?

08:17.750 --> 08:21.250
WHENEVER I TALK TO HIM, HE SHOUTS
AT THE NURSES TO QUIET DOWN,

08:21.350 --> 08:23.150
ACTING LIKE
I'M NOT HERE.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.850
BUT I KNOW HE HEARS ME.

08:24.950 --> 08:26.350
I CAN
SEE HIM REACTING.

08:26.450 --> 08:28.250
WHY WON'T HE
LISTEN TO ME?

08:28.250 --> 08:29.450
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO BELIEVE IT.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.250
BECAUSE IF IT'S TRUE
AND HE HEARS YOU,

08:31.250 --> 08:32.549
THEN HE MIGHT BE A NUT JOB.

08:32.549 --> 08:34.650
I THINK
WE'RE DONE HERE, OK?

08:34.650 --> 08:36.150
YOU CAN'T JUST
SHUT THEM OUT.

08:36.150 --> 08:37.650
IT'S ONLY GOING
TO GET WORSE.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.250
LOOK, I CAN HELP YOU.
JUST PLEASE-

08:40.250 --> 08:42.850
IT'S NOT JUST THAT HE HAD
NEVER HEARD GHOSTS BEFORE THIS.

08:42.950 --> 08:45.150
I WAS THERE.
OK, I SAW ELI'S SPIRIT

08:45.250 --> 08:46.850
LEAVE HIS BODY
AND THEN COME BACK.

08:46.950 --> 08:48.150
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.950
OH, AND THAT'S WHY I'M
GIVING YOU THESE BOOKS.

08:50.050 --> 08:52.350
THESE BOOKS COVER ALL
OF THAT AND MORE, OK?

08:52.450 --> 08:55.250
PARANORMAL PHENOMENA, MYTHS,
THEORIES ABOUT THE BEYOND.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.650
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.950
HOW COME EVERYONE
IS TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM ME?

08:58.950 --> 09:00.250
AH, FINALLY,
THE REAL ISSUE,

09:00.250 --> 09:02.450
INSTEAD OF THIS GHOST STORY
THAT YOU'RE HIDING BEHIND.

09:02.550 --> 09:04.850
YEAH, I HAVE ENOUGH SHRINKS
IN MY LIFE, THANK YOU.

09:04.850 --> 09:07.950
MELINDA, I'M NOT A VERY
SENSITIVE GUY, OK?

09:07.950 --> 09:09.150
IT ONCE TOOK A GIRLFRIEND
6 MONTHS TO BREAK UP WITH ME

09:09.250 --> 09:11.650
'CAUSE I THOUGHT SHE WAS
EXPRESSING DISBELIEF

09:11.650 --> 09:12.850
EVERY TIME SHE SAID,
"GET OUT."

09:12.850 --> 09:14.050
EVEN I CAN TELL
YOU'RE UPSET.

09:14.050 --> 09:15.650
I AM NOT UPSET.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.750
THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT ME
THAT IS UPSET, OK?

09:18.850 --> 09:20.850
YOU'RE LEAVING FOR A
SABBATICAL IN A FEW DAYS

09:20.950 --> 09:23.450
FOR SOME NEW, IMPORTANT FIND
IN THE HIMALAYAS,

09:23.550 --> 09:26.350
AND I AM VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

09:27.550 --> 09:29.550
I'M GLAD WE HAD
THIS CHAT.

09:29.650 --> 09:31.450
IT WAS VERY REFRESHING,
CLEANSING.

09:31.450 --> 09:34.150
YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY THIS
ELI CHARACTER, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

09:34.150 --> 09:35.650
HE CAN HEAR
GHOSTS, RIGHT?

09:35.650 --> 09:37.850
RIGHT. AND IT OBVIOUSLY
HAS SOMETHING TO DO

09:37.950 --> 09:39.550
WITH HIM DYING
AND THEN COMING BACK.

09:39.550 --> 09:41.550
IT HAS EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

09:41.550 --> 09:43.850
N.D.E. LITERATURE IS CHOCK
FULL OF STORIES LIKE HIS.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.050
N.D.E., YOU MEAN
NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE?

09:46.150 --> 09:48.450
YEAH. UH, HERE'S HOW
IT USUALLY WORKS-

09:48.550 --> 09:49.850
YOU DIE,
YOU COME BACK TO LIFE,

09:49.950 --> 09:51.650
AND IN SOME
VERY RARE CASES,

09:51.750 --> 09:53.650
THERE'S A, UH, A THREAD

09:53.650 --> 09:55.350
THAT CONNECTS YOU
TO WHERE YOU WERE,

09:55.450 --> 09:57.050
A TETHER,
IF YOU WILL.

09:57.150 --> 09:59.550
SO HOW COME HE CAN HEAR GHOSTS
BUT HE CAN'T SEE THEM?

09:59.650 --> 10:02.250
SOME N.D.E.s CAN
SEE THE GHOSTS,

10:02.250 --> 10:03.550
SOME CAN HEAR THEM,
SOME CAN EVEN SMELL THEM,

10:03.650 --> 10:05.350
AND THAT'S THE WORST BECAUSE
EVERYTHING ON THE OTHER SIDE

10:05.450 --> 10:07.350
SMELLS LIKE STINKY,
ROTTEN EGGS.

10:07.350 --> 10:09.250
UGH. AND THAT'S PERMANENT?

10:09.250 --> 10:10.450
IT VARIES, IT VARIES.

10:10.550 --> 10:11.950
SOMETIMES YOUR SENSES
GOT STRONG

10:11.950 --> 10:13.450
AS YOUR BRAIN PROCESSES
THE NEW INPUT,

10:13.450 --> 10:15.850
OTHER TIMES
THE THREAD SNAPS,

10:15.850 --> 10:19.350
AND YOU'RE JUST A POOR,
SIGHTLESS MOLE LIKE ME.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.450
YOUR FRIEND ELI, NOT
UNIVERSALLY LIKED HERE AT SCHOOL.

10:23.550 --> 10:24.750
WHO DOESN'T LIKE HIM?

10:24.750 --> 10:26.150
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.850
BUT MOST OF MEMBERS OF THE "I
DON'T LIKE THAT GUY ELI" FAN CLUB

10:28.950 --> 10:30.250
ARE IN HIS OWN
DEPARTMENT.

10:30.350 --> 10:31.650
THEY THINK HE'S A BIT
OF A COWBOY.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.250
BREAKS A LOT OF RULES,

10:33.250 --> 10:35.150
WHICH NORMALLY I WOULD APPLAUD... BUT?

10:35.250 --> 10:38.750
BUT THEY SAY HE DOES SO AT
THE EXPENSE OF HIS PATIENTS.

10:38.750 --> 10:41.750
YOU KEEP THINKING
EVERY NEW DAY

10:41.850 --> 10:43.250
WILL BE DIFFERENT,

10:43.350 --> 10:44.950
BUT IT NEVER IS.

10:44.950 --> 10:46.550
DAY AFTER DAY-

10:46.650 --> 10:48.550
BUDDY?

10:48.650 --> 10:49.950
AFTER DAY-
BUDDY.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.450
AFTER DAY-

10:51.450 --> 10:53.950
HEY, BUDDY.
AFTER DAY-

10:53.950 --> 10:55.550
YOU SAID YOU WANTED A SHOT
OF SOMETHING. WHAT WILL IT BE?

10:55.550 --> 10:58.350
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.850
I ALREADY TURNED
DOWN THE MUSIC.

10:59.850 --> 11:01.950
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

11:04.250 --> 11:05.450
HEY!

11:07.000 --> 11:09.750
I THINK MAYBE YOU NEED TO CALL SOMEBODY.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.850
YOU THINK?

11:13.550 --> 11:16.250
LOOK! WHOEVER
YOU PEOPLE ARE,

11:16.250 --> 11:18.050
I CAN'T HELP ANY OF YOU!

11:18.150 --> 11:20.450
ESPECIALLY
IF I'M UNDER A BUS,

11:20.550 --> 11:22.900
AND THAT'S MY NEXT STOP!

11:22.910 --> 11:25.700
Everybody just shut up!

11:27.350 --> 11:28.650
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CALLED ME?

11:28.750 --> 11:30.250
YEAH, HE SAID YOU
MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.050
HE SCARED ALL MY BUSINESS
AWAY, I HAD TO CALL THE POLICE.

11:32.050 --> 11:33.350
WELL, YOU CAN CALL
THE POLICE BACK

11:33.450 --> 11:35.350
AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OK.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.750
WHO ARE YOU,
HIS DOCTOR?

11:36.750 --> 11:38.750
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA
SOUND STRANGE,

11:38.850 --> 11:40.150
BUT IF YOU WANT YOUR BAR BACK-

11:40.250 --> 11:41.450
HEY, DO WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO.

11:41.550 --> 11:42.550
GREAT.

11:42.650 --> 11:45.550
OK, EVERYONE,
LET'S QUIET DOWN.

11:45.550 --> 11:48.050
QUIET DOWN.

11:48.050 --> 11:50.250
I SAID QUIET!

11:53.050 --> 11:55.450
LOOK, YOU ALL WANT HELP,

11:55.550 --> 11:58.050
AND I REALLY
UNDERSTAND THAT.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.850
BUT IT'S GONNA HAVE
TO HAPPEN ONE AT A TIME,

12:00.950 --> 12:02.150
AND LATER OR NOT AT ALL.

12:03.950 --> 12:05.750
OR NOT AT ALL!

12:06.850 --> 12:09.550
NOW LEAVE US ALONE.

12:09.650 --> 12:11.650
GO.

12:13.850 --> 12:17.450
SOMETIMES IT HELPS
TO PRETEND IT'S REAL.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.850
HOW DID YOU GET THEM
TO LISTEN TO YOU?

12:23.950 --> 12:26.750
I JUST TOLD THEM THAT I WOULD
DO THE SAME FOR THEM LATER.

12:26.850 --> 12:28.950
YEAH, GREAT, BUT HOW DO YOU
KEEP THEM FROM COMING BACK?

12:28.950 --> 12:30.350
YOU DON'T.

12:32.450 --> 12:33.650
WHO ARE YOU?

12:33.750 --> 12:35.950
HMM, IT'S
A LONG STORY.

12:35.950 --> 12:38.150
LET'S HAVE A SEAT.

12:40.750 --> 12:43.450
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS,
I'M NOT DEAD.

12:43.550 --> 12:45.750
THE BAD NEWS IS, I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

12:45.750 --> 12:47.050
LISTENING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE?

12:47.050 --> 12:48.750
AND HELPING THEM.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.050
IT'S HOW
THEY CAN GET PEACE,

12:51.050 --> 12:53.150
AND YOU CAN GET
A LITTLE FOR YOURSELF.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.950
YOU SAID IT MIGHT
CHANGE OVER TIME,

12:54.950 --> 12:56.750
LIKE THE GHOST VOICES
MIGHT GO AWAY?

12:56.850 --> 12:58.350
ANYTHING
IS POSSIBLE, YES.

12:58.350 --> 13:01.050
ANY CHANCE I CAN
SPEED UP THAT PROCESS?

13:01.150 --> 13:03.250
I MEAN, WITH LIKE A
BASEBALL BAT TO MY HEAD?

13:03.350 --> 13:04.550
SOME MEDS?

13:04.550 --> 13:07.150
MY MOTHER TRIED EVERYTHING
BUT THE BASEBALL BAT,

13:07.250 --> 13:09.350
AND TRUST ME, IT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO GO.

13:10.450 --> 13:13.850
I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THIS THE WRONG WAY.

13:13.850 --> 13:15.850
HEY...

13:15.850 --> 13:18.250
WHAT YOU HAVE
IS A GIFT.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.950
YEAH, FROM SOMEONE
WHO REALLY HATES ME.

13:20.950 --> 13:22.750
ELI...

13:23.950 --> 13:25.650
FIONA, YOU'RE BACK.

13:25.650 --> 13:28.250
TELL ELI HOW
HE CAN HELP YOU.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.250
I WANT HIM TO KNOW
I DON'T BLAME HIM.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.850
BLAME HIM? WHAT IS
SHE TALKING ABOUT?

13:39.950 --> 13:41.950
Man: EXCUSE ME...

13:42.050 --> 13:43.250
ARE YOU ELI JAMES?

13:43.250 --> 13:44.550
AND FRIENDS.

13:44.550 --> 13:47.150
WHO ARE YOU?

13:47.250 --> 13:48.550
DETECTIVE NEELY.

13:48.550 --> 13:49.750
YOU'RE WANTED
FOR QUESTIONING

13:49.850 --> 13:53.450
IN CONNECTION TO THE
DEATH OF FIONA RAINE.

13:58.650 --> 13:59.950
Melinda: WHAT MAKES HIM
SO SURE IT WAS ARSON?

14:00.050 --> 14:01.750
THEY'RE NOT SURE
ABOUT ANYTHING,

14:01.750 --> 14:03.850
BUT THEY FOUND ACCELERANT
TRACES NEAR THE POINT OF ORIGIN.

14:03.950 --> 14:06.150
AND THAT WOULD BE
NEAR ELI'S OFFICE?

14:06.250 --> 14:08.050
RIGHT OUTSIDE.

14:08.150 --> 14:09.450
SO HE'S A SUSPECT?

14:09.450 --> 14:10.950
NO, OFFICIALLY HE'S
A "PERSON OF INTEREST."

14:11.050 --> 14:13.050
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
EVIDENCE TO HOLD HIM HERE.

14:13.150 --> 14:14.350
BUT UNOFFICIALLY?

14:14.350 --> 14:15.750
UNOFFICIALLY,
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

14:15.850 --> 14:18.150
IF HE HAD A REASON
TO BURN DOWN HIS OWN OFFICE.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.550
I THINK IT HAD
SOMETHING TO DO

14:19.650 --> 14:20.650
WITH THE ARGUMENT
PEOPLE HEARD.

14:20.650 --> 14:21.950
BETWEEN HE AND FIONA.

14:21.950 --> 14:23.150
YOU KNOW, PAYNE
SAID THAT HE HAS

14:23.150 --> 14:24.850
A REALLY BAD REPUTATION
AT SCHOOL.

14:24.850 --> 14:25.950
AND THERE'S THE GHOST.

14:26.050 --> 14:27.550
AND WHAT ABOUT HER?

14:27.550 --> 14:28.750
RIGHT BEFORE
THE POLICE CAME IN,

14:28.750 --> 14:30.050
SHE SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T BLAME HIM.

14:30.050 --> 14:32.650
BLAME HIM FOR WHAT?
WHO KNOWS?

14:32.650 --> 14:35.450
BUT SHE'S A GHOST.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.250
I'LL SEE YOU
AT HOME?

14:37.350 --> 14:38.850
MM-HMM.
OK.

14:42.770 --> 14:43.550
SO IS IT TRUE?

14:43.650 --> 14:45.250
DID YOU START THE FIRE?

14:45.250 --> 14:46.350
NO!

14:46.450 --> 14:47.750
BUT THANKS FOR ASKING.

14:47.850 --> 14:48.950
YOU KNOW, WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT FIONA.

14:49.050 --> 14:51.050
I CAN SHRINK
MY OWN HEAD, THANKS.

14:51.150 --> 14:52.350
LOOK, I TOLD YOU IF
SHE'S NOT IN THE LIGHT,

14:52.450 --> 14:54.150
THAT SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
HERE FOR A REASON.

14:54.150 --> 14:56.050
SO SHE NEEDS
SOMETHING FROM YOU.

14:56.050 --> 14:57.450
NOT TO MENTION
WHAT YOU NEED FROM HER.

14:57.450 --> 14:58.450
OH, WHAT'S THAT?

14:58.550 --> 14:59.750
WELL, IF YOU DIDN'T
START THAT FIRE,

14:59.850 --> 15:01.550
SHE MAY BE THE ONLY
ONE WHO CAN PROVE IT.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.450
OK, LOOK. LET'S JUST
PRETEND FOR A MINUTE

15:03.550 --> 15:05.250
THAT THIS WHOLE THING
ISN'T NUTS.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.950
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

15:07.050 --> 15:09.950
OR ME. WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

15:10.050 --> 15:11.750
START TELLING
THE TRUTH.

15:11.850 --> 15:14.150
AND ALL OF IT.

15:15.150 --> 15:17.950
AT FIRST, WHEN WE MET IN MY OFFICE,

15:18.050 --> 15:20.450
SHE WOULD JUST SIT THERE WITH
HER ARMS FOLDED AND GLARE AT ME.

15:20.550 --> 15:21.950
SO I SHOOK IT UP.

15:22.050 --> 15:24.050
I KNEW SHE LIKED
HORSES,

15:24.150 --> 15:25.950
SO I TOOK HER
TO THE TRACK.

15:25.950 --> 15:27.150
AND SHE STARTED
TO TALK.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.750
WHAT WERE YOU
TREATING HER FOR?

15:28.850 --> 15:31.450
GENERAL ATTACHMENT ISSUES.
I WAS HELPING HER DUMP

15:31.550 --> 15:33.450
AN ON AGAIN-OFF AGAIN
BOYFRIEND NAMED KEN

15:33.450 --> 15:35.850
WHO'D BEEN MESSING WITH
HER HEAD SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

15:35.850 --> 15:38.350
DID THE BOYFRIEND KNOW
THAT YOU WERE TALKING TO HER?

15:38.450 --> 15:39.850
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:39.950 --> 15:43.150
SHE MOVED A FEW TOWNS AWAY
TO PUT DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM.

15:43.150 --> 15:46.350
SHE RENTS A PLACE HERE WITH
ROOMMATES THAT SHE MET THROUGH SCHOOL.

15:46.450 --> 15:48.650
A DEAD-END, LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIP.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.250
THAT'S HOW CO-DEPENDENT
THEY WERE.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.450
SHE EVEN ASKED MY ADVICE
ON TREATMENT FOR HIM.

15:53.450 --> 15:55.650
DO YOU THINK HE COULD BE
THE ONE WHO STARTED THE FIRE?

15:55.750 --> 15:57.150
THIS GUY'S GOT
A LOT OF PROBLEMS,

15:57.250 --> 15:59.750
BUT ARSON'S
NOT ONE OF THEM.

15:59.850 --> 16:02.550
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS?

16:02.650 --> 16:06.150
THIS GUY NEVER MET A CULT OR
SUPERSTITION HE DIDN'T LIKE.

16:06.150 --> 16:07.850
HE ONCE KEPT FIONA
ON THE PHONE ALL NIGHT

16:07.950 --> 16:10.050
BECAUSE AN AURA READER
CONVINCED HIM

16:10.050 --> 16:11.450
SHE WAS SEEING
ANOTHER MAN.

16:11.450 --> 16:12.750
WAS SHE?

16:15.950 --> 16:18.050
ELI, DID YOU GET INVOLVED
WITH YOUR PATIENT?

16:19.700 --> 16:20.850
NO.

16:22.450 --> 16:24.550
BUT SHE WAS COMING DOWN WITH
A CLASSIC CASE OF TRANSFERENCE.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.550
SO SHE WAS
FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU?

16:31.300 --> 16:32.550
NIGHT OF THE FIRE,

16:33.600 --> 16:35.650
I JUST TOLD FIONA I
COULDN'T TREAT HER ANYMORE.

16:35.650 --> 16:36.650
SHE FREAKED.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.250
THAT'S WHY WE WERE
AT MY OFFICE SO LATE.

16:39.350 --> 16:41.050
SHE CALLED AND SAID
SHE HAD TO SEE ME.

16:41.150 --> 16:42.250
PEOPLE HEARD YOU ARGUING.

16:42.350 --> 16:43.450
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:43.550 --> 16:45.450
I TOLD I WOULD REFER HER
TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES.

16:45.450 --> 16:47.150
SHE SAID SHE ONLY
WANTED TO SEE ME.

16:47.150 --> 16:49.150
I KEPT TELLING HER
THAT COULDN'T HAPPEN.

16:49.150 --> 16:51.050
SHE JUST KEPT
YELLING.

16:51.150 --> 16:52.050
THEN WHAT?

16:52.150 --> 16:54.050
SMOKE STARTED COMING
UNDER THE DOOR,

16:54.050 --> 16:55.150
AND I REMEMBER
IT WAS SO THICK,

16:55.250 --> 16:56.550
IT FELT LIKE
MY LUNGS WERE ON FIRE.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.850
NEXT THING I KNEW,

16:59.950 --> 17:02.150
I GUESS I WAS DEAD.

17:36.900 --> 17:37.850
THIS IS OUR OTHER
ROOMMATE.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.650
CHRISTIAN, MELINDA.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.450
SHE WAS JUST
ASKING ABOUT FIONA-

17:41.550 --> 17:42.750
HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:42.850 --> 17:44.050
AND ELI.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.750
OH.

17:45.850 --> 17:49.450
I TAKE IT YOU GUYS ARE
NOT BIG FANS OF ELI.

17:49.450 --> 17:51.850
WE DON'T WANT TO GET ANYONE IN TROUBLE.

17:51.950 --> 17:55.050
THAT'S OK. I'M NOT THE
POLICE OR THE PRESS, SO...

17:55.150 --> 17:57.050
WHAT DON'T YOU
LIKE ABOUT HIM?

17:57.150 --> 17:59.550
WELL, HE WAS
HER SHRINK, RIGHT?

17:59.650 --> 18:01.350
YES.
HMM.

18:01.450 --> 18:03.450
HE SURE DIDN'T
ACT LIKE ONE.

18:15.850 --> 18:18.450
CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC?

18:18.550 --> 18:20.350
SHRINKS ARE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE, LIKE,

18:20.450 --> 18:21.750
OFFICE HOURS, RIGHT?

18:21.850 --> 18:23.450
IT'S USUALLY
HOW IT WORKS.

18:23.550 --> 18:26.550
WELL, THIS GUY, HE'D COME
BY AT ALL DIFFERENT TIMES,

18:26.650 --> 18:28.450
DAY AND NIGHT,

18:28.450 --> 18:31.250
TAKING HER TO
RESTAURANTS, BARS.

18:31.350 --> 18:32.850
IT WAS SO OBVIOUS
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.

18:32.950 --> 18:35.350
SOMETHING ROMANTIC?

18:41.350 --> 18:44.450
HEH. HE SURE
WISHED IT WAS.

18:44.450 --> 18:46.050
WHAT ABOUT FIONA?

18:46.150 --> 18:47.750
SHE LIKED THE ATTENTION.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.450
THE DRINKS WERE FREE.

18:49.450 --> 18:50.950
AND THAT'S AS FAR
AS IT WENT WITH HER?

18:50.950 --> 18:52.450
DEFINITELY.
FOR SURE.

18:52.550 --> 18:55.150
SHE HAS LOTS OF PICTURES
OF THE THREE OF YOU,

18:55.250 --> 18:56.750
BUT NO FAMILY PHOTOS.

18:56.850 --> 18:58.050
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
SHE MIGHT KEEP THEM?

18:58.150 --> 19:00.050
I DON'T KNOW.

19:00.050 --> 19:02.550
BUT I ONLY MOVED IN
IN THE SPRING.

19:02.650 --> 19:03.950
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
ROOMMATES FOR LONGER.

19:04.050 --> 19:05.850
DID SHE EVER TALK
ABOUT THAT STUFF WITH YOU?

19:17.950 --> 19:20.450
Fiona: ELI, NO...

19:38.850 --> 19:40.250
FIONA?

20:10.130 --> 20:11.350
Fiona: PLEASE...

20:11.350 --> 20:13.150
PLEASE.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.350
MAKE IT STOP.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.850
MAKE WHAT STOP?

20:20.850 --> 20:21.950
HER.

20:22.050 --> 20:25.550
MAKE HER LEAVE US ALONE,
OR I'LL MAKE HER,

20:25.650 --> 20:27.550
LIKE I MADE YOU.

20:30.350 --> 20:32.950
GHOSTS HAVE THE ABILITY
TO MANIPULATE ENERGY,

20:32.960 --> 20:34.760
ESPECIALLY ANGRY GHOSTS.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.460
THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE
DONE IT A LOT LIKE

20:36.460 --> 20:38.460
SUNSHINE THROUGH
A MAGNIFYING GLASS.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.460
SO YOU THINK
THIS IS A PATTERN

20:40.560 --> 20:42.560
BECAUSE FIONA HAD
A HISTORY OF ARSON?

20:42.660 --> 20:44.560
SHE BURNED DOWN
THE HOUSE

20:44.660 --> 20:46.560
THAT SHE WAS LIVING IN
WHEN SHE WAS 12.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.760
HOW COME THE POLICE
DIDN'T KNOW THIS?

20:48.760 --> 20:49.860
HOW COME WE DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

20:49.960 --> 20:51.060
'CAUSE SHE WAS SO YOUNG,

20:51.160 --> 20:52.160
THERE WAS NEVER
ANY CHARGES.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.960
THERE WAS NEVER
ANY CRIMINAL RECORD.

20:54.060 --> 20:55.660
BUT SHE WAS A WARD
OF THE STATE,

20:55.660 --> 20:57.960
AND IT WENT INTO
FAMILY SERVICE'S FILES.

20:58.060 --> 20:59.160
AS HER THERAPIST,

20:59.260 --> 21:00.460
I HAD ACCESS
TO THOSE FILES.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.360
SO THAT'S WHY SHE DIDN'T
HAVE ANY FAMILY PICTURES,

21:02.360 --> 21:03.560
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
HAVE A FAMILY.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.360
THEY DIED
WHEN SHE WAS A 3.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.260
THE HOUSE THAT SHE BURNED
DOWN WAS HER FOSTER FATHER'S.

21:07.260 --> 21:09.060
I TAKE IT SHE WASN'T
TOO FOND OF THE GUY.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.360
OR HIS PHYSICAL
AND MENTAL ABUSE.

21:11.460 --> 21:13.260
WHERE DOES HE LIVE NOW,
AN ASHTRAY?

21:13.360 --> 21:15.060
HE WAS OUT OF THE HOUSE
WHEN SHE BURNED IT DOWN.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.060
BUT SHE MADE HER POINT.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.360
SHE GOT PLACED
WITH ANOTHER FAMILY.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.860
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING BEFORE?

21:22.000 --> 21:25.160
BECAUSE I-I THOUGHT SHE
STARTED THAT FIRE BECAUSE OF ME.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.860
I THINK SHE DIED
BECAUSE OF ME.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.260
HOW COULD SHE HAVE
STARTED IT?

21:29.360 --> 21:30.960
SHE WAS WITH YOU
IN THE SAME ROOM.

21:31.060 --> 21:32.460
I DON'T KNOW.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.460
A HOMEMADE DEVICE
WITH A FUSE HANGING OUT,

21:34.460 --> 21:36.260
SHE DROPPED IT OFF AT THE
FRONT RIGHT BEFORE SHE CAME IN.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.460
SO YOU THINK THAT SHE
WANTED TO KILL YOU.

21:39.460 --> 21:40.560
OR AT LEAST THREATEN ME,

21:40.660 --> 21:42.260
LIKE SHE DID
HER FOSTER FATHER.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.760
BUT SHE HAD NO IDEA THE
FIRE WAS GOING TO SPREAD.

21:43.860 --> 21:47.260
OK, SO YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE,
WHY COME CLEAN NOW?

21:48.660 --> 21:50.560
LAST NIGHT, I...

21:52.360 --> 21:54.860
I HEARD HER VOICE AGAIN.

21:55.700 --> 21:56.860
SHE WAS MAKING THREATS.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.760
I WARNED YOU
ABOUT THIS.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.060
AGAINST YOU.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.960
SHE SAID, "TELL HER
TO LEAVE US ALONE,

22:02.060 --> 22:04.260
OR I'LL DO THE SAME THING
TO HER THAT I DID TO YOU."

22:04.360 --> 22:06.460
OK. SO WE NEED TO GET HER TO CROSS OVER.

22:06.460 --> 22:07.860
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
STICKING AROUND

22:07.960 --> 22:09.860
FOR SOME REASON, AND IT'S
NOT TO APOLOGIZE TO ELI.

22:09.860 --> 22:11.760
HERE'S SOMETHING
VERY MYSTERIOUS.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.860
HOW COME ALL YOUR NOTES
SMELL LIKE BEER?

22:13.960 --> 22:15.160
BECAUSE THEY WERE
ON FIRE.

22:15.260 --> 22:17.060
THE BOTTLE WAS CLOSER
THAN THE EXTINGUISHER.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.760
I'M SMELLING A PILSNER,

22:18.760 --> 22:20.460
MAYBE SOMETHING CZECH.

22:20.460 --> 22:22.060
NOT BAD.
I WENT TO COLLEGE.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.360
OK. WE KNOW THAT
SHE'S HAUNTING SOMEONE.

22:25.460 --> 22:26.560
WE CAN'T FIND
THE BOYFRIEND.

22:26.660 --> 22:27.760
WHAT ABOUT
THE FOSTER DAD?

22:27.860 --> 22:30.260
YEAH, HE'S THE FIRST PERSON
SHE TRIED TO COOK.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.860
HE DIED 6 YEARS AGO,
HEART ATTACK, I THINK.

22:33.860 --> 22:36.360
GOOD RIDDANCE,
IF YOU ASK ME.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.060
HOW DID FIONA GET ALONG WITH
HER FOSTER FAMILIES AFTERWARDS,

22:39.060 --> 22:41.060
WERE THERE
ANY MORE PROBLEMS?

22:41.160 --> 22:42.660
NO, SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.060
SHE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

22:45.060 --> 22:47.860
WISH I COULD HAVE DONE
MORE FOR HER.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.360
DO YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE
ASKING THESE QUESTIONS?

22:53.360 --> 22:55.360
IT'S ABOUT THE FIRE
AT ROCKLAND U.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.260
SOME PEOPLE THINK
FIONA STARTED IT.

22:59.860 --> 23:02.660
IS THERE A REASON
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T?

23:07.060 --> 23:09.060
YOU KNOW WHAT,

23:09.060 --> 23:11.560
FORGET WE ASKED.
I'M SORRY.

23:11.560 --> 23:15.260
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO VIOLATE
PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.260
SCREW CONFIDENTIALITY.

23:17.260 --> 23:19.160
THOSE RULES ARE THERE
TO PROTECT THOSE KIDS,

23:19.160 --> 23:21.160
AND THEY'RE NOT
PROTECTING FIONA.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.860
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING ARSON'S
A GOOD WAY TO SOLVE ANYTHING,

23:24.860 --> 23:27.660
BUT THERE WERE THREE
OTHER FOSTERS IN THAT HOME.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.660
I SURE WISH WE'D KNOWN
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.360
IF FIONA STARTED THAT FIRE,

23:32.360 --> 23:35.460
SHE DIDN'T JUST SAVE HERSELF,
SHE SAVED ALL OF THEIR LIVES.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.860
AND IF SHE DIDN'T...

23:36.860 --> 23:38.360
YOU KEEP SAYING "IF."

23:38.360 --> 23:39.460
DO THE MATH.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.560
ONE KID WAS YOUNGER,
2 KIDS WERE OLDER.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.060
OLD ENOUGH TO BE TRIED AS ADULTS?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.460
CAN YOU GIVE US
THEIR NAMES?

23:49.460 --> 23:51.360
I CAN'T.

23:51.460 --> 23:53.660
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS-

23:53.760 --> 23:56.660
AFTER THE FIRE, WHEN I
ASKED FIONA WHAT HAPPENED,

23:56.660 --> 23:58.160
SHE ZIPPED THOSE LIPS TIGHT.

23:58.260 --> 24:01.460
BUT THE SECOND THE COPS STARTED
QUESTIONING HER OLDER SIBLINGS,

24:01.460 --> 24:04.760
SHE CAME RIGHT OUT AND
PRACTICALLY SHOUTED, "I DID IT!"

24:07.260 --> 24:09.860
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'VE SEEN HER GHOST,

24:09.960 --> 24:12.360
BUT NOW YOU CAN'T FIND
HER, SO YOU CAME HERE?

24:12.460 --> 24:17.260
SOMETIMES SPIRITS ATTACH
THEMSELVES TO PLACES THEY KNOW.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.660
I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD
FIND HER IN HER BEDROOM.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.360
THAT STILL DOESN'T
TELL ME WHY HE'S HERE.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.760
I, UM...

24:26.760 --> 24:30.460
I CAN TALK TO THEM, TOO.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.860
GHOSTS.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
I KNOW, IT SOUNDS NUTS.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.560
I STILL THINK SO MYSELF.

24:35.660 --> 24:36.860
DO YOU REALLY EXPECT US
TO BELIEVE THAT-

24:36.960 --> 24:39.460
I BELIEVE HIM.
WHAT?

24:39.560 --> 24:40.760
EVER SINCE FI DIED,

24:40.860 --> 24:43.060
WE'VE BOTH HAD
THIS FEELING...

24:43.160 --> 24:45.060
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DESCRIBE IT,

24:45.160 --> 24:47.960
BUBUT SOMEHOW
WE FELT HER.

24:47.960 --> 24:48.960
HAVEN'T WE, MARLEY?

24:49.060 --> 24:51.660
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE'S STILL HERE.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.760
BUT SHE DOESN'T BELONG HERE.
SHE REALLY NEEDS TO CROSS OVER.

24:54.860 --> 24:55.760
WELL, GO TALK
TO HER THEN.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.560
CHRISTIAN!
WHY NOT?

24:57.660 --> 25:00.060
WHAT IS THE HARM?

25:02.760 --> 25:04.760
OH, ONE FAVOR.

25:04.860 --> 25:06.060
SHE HAS THIS CD.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.560
COULD YOU ASK HER
IF IT'D BE OK

25:08.660 --> 25:10.660
IF I WAS TO KEEP IT,

25:10.760 --> 25:12.760
BEFORE WE RELEASE THE REST OF HER STUFF?

25:12.860 --> 25:14.260
WE'D BE HAPPY TO.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.860
FIONA?

25:21.960 --> 25:25.760
IF YOU'RE NEARBY
AND YOU CAN HEAR ME,

25:25.860 --> 25:28.160
WE REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.560
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

25:39.960 --> 25:42.860
THE SAME AS I ALWAYS DID.

25:42.860 --> 25:44.060
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.660
SINCE WHEN DID YOU
EVER HELP ANYONE?

25:45.760 --> 25:48.260
LOOK, WE NEED TO KNOW
THE TRUTH.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.960
DID YOU START THE FIRES
OR DIDN'T YOU?

25:51.060 --> 25:52.560
IT WAS OUTSIDE
HIS OFFICE.

25:52.660 --> 25:54.660
I KNEW HE'D BE IN THERE. WHO
ELSE WOULD HAVE STARTED IT?

25:54.760 --> 25:56.060
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT
THAT FIRE.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.060
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ONE
AT YOUR FOSTER DAD'S HOUSE.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.860
I STARTED BOTH.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.560
WHY WORK SO HARD TO MAKE ME
THINK YOU'RE AN ARSONIST?

26:04.560 --> 26:06.960
WHY WORK SO HARD TO MAKE ME
THINK YOU REALLY CARED ABOUT ME?

26:07.060 --> 26:08.860
COME ON, THIS IS SERIOUS.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.360
THIS ISN'T A GAME.

26:10.460 --> 26:11.760
THAT'S FUNNY,
COMING FROM YOU.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.860
I JUST REMEMBER SOMETHING.

26:13.860 --> 26:17.560
WHAT YOU SAID TO ELI, YOU SAID,
"LEAVE US ALONE." ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

26:17.660 --> 26:19.660
BACK IN MY APARTMENT, YES.

26:19.660 --> 26:21.360
OK, SO THEN
WHO'S THE "US," FIONA?

26:21.460 --> 26:24.260
BECAUSE AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT HAD
TO DO WITH YOU AND ELI, BUT NOW-

26:24.360 --> 26:26.060
I STARTED THOSE FIRES.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.160
DON'T MAKE ME
START MORE.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.560
LOOK, IF YOU'RE HIDING
SOMETHING

26:29.660 --> 26:31.160
OR SOMEONE,
WE'RE NOT THE POLICE.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.460
OK? WE DON'T WANT TO-

26:33.460 --> 26:35.060
Eli: WHOA,
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

26:35.160 --> 26:37.260
Melinda: SHE'S GONE.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.560
WHAT IF SHE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH?

26:41.660 --> 26:44.960
SHE'S COVERING FOR SOMEONE.
MAYBE IT'S THAT BOYFRIEND,

26:45.060 --> 26:47.560
BUT I JUST THINK IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT FIRST FIRE, YOU KNOW,

26:47.560 --> 26:48.960
LIKE A FOSTER KID.

26:49.060 --> 26:51.160
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO
ELSE LIVED IN THAT HOUSE.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.460
GUESS I WON'T TAKE
ANYTHING OUT TODAY.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.260
"STRUCTURE EMPTY
AT TIME OF FIRE.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.960
"OCCUPANTS LATER
ACCOUNTED FOR.

27:24.060 --> 27:26.360
OWNER TOM MOODY"-

27:27.260 --> 27:30.060
"MINORS FEMALE, 12 YEARS,

27:30.160 --> 27:33.460
FEMALE, 16 YEARS,
MALE, 18 YEARS."

27:40.560 --> 27:42.260
FIONA!

27:42.360 --> 27:45.460
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN LIKE THIS.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.360
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD SISTER.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.560
WHICH ONE ARE YOU
COVERING FOR, HIM OR HER?

27:51.660 --> 27:53.760
I WARNED YOU.
STAY AWAY.

27:53.860 --> 27:55.760
I'LL MOVE ON
WHEN YOU WILL.

27:55.860 --> 27:57.460
MAYBE SOME THINGS
ARE BETTER OFF LEFT ALONE,

27:57.560 --> 27:59.260
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT?

28:03.860 --> 28:05.160
FIONA, NO.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.460
I'M SORRY.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.960
I REALLY AM,

28:09.060 --> 28:10.860
BUT YOU BROUGHT
THIS ON YOURSELF,

28:10.960 --> 28:12.860
AND NOW YOU HAVE
TO PAY THE PRICE.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.900
THAT WAS A LONGSHOT,
ANYWAY.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.400
WITHOUT A COURT ORDER,

28:28.500 --> 28:30.500
THE COUNTY KEEPS FAMILY
SERVICE RECORDS SEALED.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.100
WHY HASN'T MELINDA
CALLED BY NOW?

28:32.100 --> 28:33.100
SHE MUST HAVE
FOUND SOMETHING.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.300
MAYBE SHE HAS CALLED.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.400
HAVE YOU CHECKED
YOUR ESP-MAIL?

28:36.500 --> 28:38.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S CRAZIER,

28:38.300 --> 28:39.800
THE FACT THAT SHE BELIEVES
IN ALL THIS STUFF,

28:39.900 --> 28:42.100
OR THE FACT
THAT I BELIEVE HER.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.900
I HEARD THAT.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

28:44.000 --> 28:46.700
THAT SHE'S THE MOST
AMAZING PERSON I'VE MET SINCE...

28:46.800 --> 28:49.500
SHE'S THE MOST AMAZING PERSON
I'VE EVER MET.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.800
I HEAR THAT, TOO.

28:51.800 --> 28:55.600
YEAH. WHAT'S SO SIGNIFICANT
ABOUT THESE NOTES, ELI?

28:55.600 --> 28:57.900
FIONA ALWAYS DESCRIBED
HIM IN SO MUCH DETAIL,

28:57.900 --> 28:59.400
BUT SHE NEVER USED
HIS LAST NAME.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.100
HE, WHO'S HE?

29:01.200 --> 29:03.200
HER BOYFRIEND.
AND SOMETHING ELSE,

29:03.300 --> 29:06.100
HOW WAS HE PACKING UP HER
STUFF WHEN THERE WERE NO BOXES?

29:06.200 --> 29:08.000
HE WHO? YOU SAID
YOU NEVER MET HIM.

29:08.100 --> 29:09.800
CHRISTIAN, THE ROOMMATE.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.100
HE SAID HE WAS
PILING UP HER STUFF

29:12.200 --> 29:14.200
SO HE COULD RELEASE IT.

29:14.300 --> 29:15.900
RELEASE IT? THAT'S THE
WORD HE USED, RELEASE?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.100
YEAH. I FOUND THAT ODD
AT THE TIME.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.700
THE WHOLE THING WAS.
RELEASING HER STUFF,

29:20.800 --> 29:23.400
BUT WANTING TO KEEP
SOME RANDOM FOLK MUSIC CD?

29:23.500 --> 29:24.600
WHAT KIND OF FOLK MUSIC?

29:24.700 --> 29:26.500
AFRICAN, I THINK.
OK.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.100
BUT WHAT DID HE PUT HER
THINGS IN IF IT WASN'T BOXES?

29:29.100 --> 29:30.500
HE HAD SOME KIND
OF METAL TUB.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.700
DIDN'T YOU SAY HER BOYFRIEND
WAS INTO THE OCCULT,

29:32.800 --> 29:34.200
AND WEIRD BELIEFS?

29:34.300 --> 29:36.800
YEAH, WHY? WELL, IT
WAS AN AFRICAN CUSTOM,

29:36.800 --> 29:38.400
PART OF THE YORUBA
TRADITION,

29:38.500 --> 29:40.800
WHERE POSSESSIONS OF SOMEONE
WHO'S PASSED PREMATURELY

29:40.900 --> 29:42.800
ARE SET FIRE TO.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.200
THAT WAY IT'LL RELEASE
THEIR SPIRIT.

29:44.300 --> 29:45.900
YOU KNOW, WHY ELSE
WOULD HE USE A METAL TUB

29:46.000 --> 29:48.200
UNLESS HE WAS GOING
TO TIE-DYE EVERYTHING?

29:49.600 --> 29:52.200
SHE SAID HER BOYFRIEND
LIVED OUT OF TOWN.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.300
WELL, WHAT IF SHE
MADE THAT PART UP?

29:53.400 --> 29:54.000
WHAT IF SHE HAD
NO BOYFRIEND?

29:54.010 --> 29:56.500
WHAT IF SHE HAD ALL THE
PROBLEMS SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT,

29:56.600 --> 29:59.800
BUT WITH SOMEONE SHE WASN'T
ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH?

29:59.900 --> 30:02.000
SOMEONE SHE WANTED
TO GET AWAY FROM,

30:02.100 --> 30:03.600
BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO.

30:03.700 --> 30:07.400
WHO SHE FELT SHE NEEDED
TO PROTECT AT THE SAME TIME.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.400
I THINK WE ALREADY KNOW THIS
QUOTE, UNQUOTE BOYFRIEND.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.000
AND THE FOSTER BROTHER.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.000
AND THEY'RE BOTH.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.800
CHRISTIAN!

30:19.900 --> 30:22.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:26.300 --> 30:27.900
HERE,

30:27.900 --> 30:29.300
BREATHE THROUGH THIS, OK?

30:29.400 --> 30:30.500
BECAUSE YOU COULD GET KILLED.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.800
THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.500
THEY'LL FIND ME, THEN
THEY'LL KNOW THE TRUTH.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.900
CHRISTIAN, LOOK, I GET IT.
OK, YOU WANTED TO PROTECT HER

30:37.000 --> 30:38.200
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU FOLLOWED ME HERE.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.300
WE TOOK CARE
OF EACH OTHER.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.400
OK, WELL,
LET'S TELL HER THAT,

30:40.400 --> 30:42.200
ALL RIGHT? LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE, COME ON.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.600
SHE WOULDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.700
THEN WHY'D SHE HAVE
TO START SEEING HIM?

30:45.700 --> 30:48.000
BECAUSE! SHE NEEDED HELP
FOR THE BOTH OF YOU.

30:48.100 --> 30:50.900
OK, SHE JUST WANTED
ADVICE FROM ELI.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.500
COME ON!

30:52.500 --> 30:54.000
SHE WAS TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.500
I WAS MORE LIKE A FAMILY
THAN ANYONE SHE EVER HAD!

30:56.600 --> 30:58.500
NO, SHE WANTED TO HELP YOU
JUST LIKE YOU HELPED HER.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.400
I DIDN'T HELP HER,
I KILLED HER!

31:01.400 --> 31:02.700
BUT YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.600
YOU DIDN'T WANT HER TO TALK
TO ELI, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

31:05.600 --> 31:08.800
I SAW HER CRYING
AFTER SHE TALKED TO HIM.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.600
I SAW WHAT
HE DID TO HER.

31:11.700 --> 31:14.500
SO I WENT TO HIS OFFICE
AND STARTED THE FIRE.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.800
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO SCARE HIM AWAY.

31:15.900 --> 31:18.300
LIKE I DID IN THE FIRST
FIRE WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.700
ELI NEEDS TO HEAR THIS, OK?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.200
WE JUST-LET'S JUST
GET OUT OF HERE!

31:25.200 --> 31:26.600
SHE'LL NEVER
FORGIVE ME!

31:26.600 --> 31:29.000
I'M SURE THAT
SHE'S ALREADY FORGIVEN YOU!

31:29.000 --> 31:30.400
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

31:30.400 --> 31:31.700
WHY DO YOU THINK

31:31.800 --> 31:33.900
SHE WANTED US TO BELIEVE
SHE WAS THE ARSONIST?

31:33.900 --> 31:35.300
IT'S BECAUSE SHE LOVES YOU.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.800
OK, BECAUSE SHE WANTED
TO PROTECT YOU.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.600
SHE'S RIGHT, CHRISTIAN,
LISTEN TO HER!

31:40.700 --> 31:43.600
SHE'S HERE!
SHE'S HERE, OK?

31:43.600 --> 31:46.600
SHE WANTS YOU TO LIVE, SO
PLEASE, PLEASE JUST TAKE THIS.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.300
JUST-PLEASE!

31:48.300 --> 31:50.200
OH, GOD, HE'S DYING!

31:50.300 --> 31:52.000
IT'S TOO LATE!

31:52.100 --> 31:54.500
NO, IT IS NOT TOO LATE!
ALL RIGHT, GO AND GET ELI!

31:54.600 --> 31:56.200
QUICK! CHRISTIAN, COME ON!

31:56.200 --> 31:57.700
Fiona: ELI, I NEED YOU.
I NEED YOU TO HEAR ME.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.300
I'M RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF
YOU. I NEED YOUR HELP, PLEASE.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.100
SHE STILL HASN'T ANSWERED.
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.600
THERE'S A FIRE.
I COULDN'T HELP THEM...

32:02.700 --> 32:03.800
WHOA.
WHAT?

32:03.900 --> 32:05.000
WHAT WAS THAT?
THE GHOST.

32:05.100 --> 32:07.300
THE GHOST, WHERE? I THOUGHT
YOU COULDN'T SEE THEM.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.500
IT'S RIGHT BY ME.
THE ARCHIVES, HURRY!

32:08.500 --> 32:10.600
FIONA, IS THAT YOU?

32:10.600 --> 32:12.200
THEY NEED YOU
TO COME RIGHT NOW.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.300
SLOW DOWN, I CAN'T
SEE YOUR LIPS MOVE.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.900
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK SLOWLY.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.900
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE,
CHRISTIAN AND THAT WOMAN.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.600
MELINDA? WHERE IS SHE?

32:19.700 --> 32:20.900
THE ARCHIVES! HURRY!

32:27.500 --> 32:29.400
Melinda: THE TUNNEL DOOR.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.300
ELI? ELI, WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:14.300 --> 33:15.700
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.100
WHAT'S GOING ON
AT THE ARCHIVES?

33:17.200 --> 33:19.500
OH, MY GOD, MELINDA!

33:19.500 --> 33:22.700
HEY, WE GOT A FIRE AT
THE ARCHIVES. GOTTA GO.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.800
YOU'RE THE ONE
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.800
AND THE FIRE, YOU-

34:23.900 --> 34:25.699
YOU WERE THERE, TOO.

34:25.699 --> 34:28.100
WE'RE IN MANY PLACES,
IT'S TRUE.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.800
WHY?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.500
WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?

34:31.500 --> 34:33.000
TO WATCH.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.600
BUT JUST NOW...

34:34.699 --> 34:37.000
YOU DID MORE THAN WATCH.
YOU-YOU SAVED ME,

34:37.100 --> 34:39.000
DIDN'T YOU?

34:39.100 --> 34:41.300
WE WERE ONLY
RETURNING A FAVOR.

34:41.400 --> 34:42.900
HOW DID I EVER
HELP YOU?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.900
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT NOW.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.800
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

34:47.900 --> 34:49.600
UNDERSTAND WHAT?

34:49.699 --> 34:51.300
WE WATCH MANY LIKE YOU
WHO DO WHAT YOU DO

34:51.300 --> 34:52.500
BUT DON'T UNDERSTAND.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.699
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO
TELL ME I SHOULD STOP,

34:54.800 --> 34:56.100
YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF.

34:56.100 --> 34:58.400
UNDERSTAND THE PRICE.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.600
YOU DON'T KNOW THE PRICE.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.100
WHAT PRICE?

35:02.200 --> 35:04.900
YOU MOVE BETWEEN THE WORLD
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.300
LIKE YOUR FRIEND ELI,

35:06.400 --> 35:08.900
SOMETIMES YOU COME BACK FROM
ONE WITH A TOUCH OF THE OTHER.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.800
A TOUCH?

35:10.900 --> 35:12.800
OF DEATH.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.400
BE CAREFUL.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.000
IT MIGHT BRUSH OFF.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.900
ON WHAT?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
ON WHAT YOU TOUCH.

35:27.700 --> 35:29.400
Melinda: IT'S OK. I
BARELY BREATHED ANY SMOKE.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.100
Jim: IT'S JUST A PRECAUTION.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.500
LOOK, I USED MY CLOTHING LIKE
YOU TAUGHT ME A THOUSAND TIMES.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.900
STAYED LOW TO THE GROUND?

35:34.900 --> 35:36.200
I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

35:36.300 --> 35:37.700
DON'T I GET ANY CREDIT
FOR THAT?

35:37.800 --> 35:39.500
FULL CREDIT, OK?

35:39.600 --> 35:41.600
ALL THE CREDIT IN THE WORLD.
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING?

35:41.700 --> 35:43.500
I'LL GET YOU SOME WATER.
YES.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.000
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

35:59.300 --> 36:02.000
HEY, THANKS FOR LETTING
THEM HAVE A MINUTE TOGETHER.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.100
I STILL DON'T GET
A GUY TRIES TO KILL HER

36:06.200 --> 36:08.400
AND ALL SHE WANTS TO DO
IS GET HIM HELP.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.500
Melinda: FIONA
UNDERSTANDS, CHRISTIAN.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.400
SHE LOVES AND FORGIVES YOU.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.100
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO BOTH SAY GOOD-BYE.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.700
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

36:28.800 --> 36:30.800
THAT'S MY WIFE.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.800
WE KEPT IN TOUCH
AFTER THEY PUT US

36:34.900 --> 36:36.500
IN DIFFERENT
FOSTER HOMES.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.100
THEN AFTER I GOT A JOB
AND MY OWN PLACE,

36:39.100 --> 36:41.900
I HEARD HE'D BEEN GETTING
INTO FIGHTS AND STUFF.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.700
I ASKED HIM TO MOVE IN,

36:43.800 --> 36:45.000
BUT I MADE HIM
PRETEND HE WAS JUST

36:45.100 --> 36:48.500
SOME ROOMMATE
I MET ON THE INTERNET.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.500
I WAS AFRAID PEOPLE
WOULD FIGURE OUT

36:50.600 --> 36:52.600
WHERE WE CAME FROM.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.300
THE FIRE AND EVERYTHING.

36:54.300 --> 36:55.900
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO GET HELP?

36:56.000 --> 36:59.400
I NEEDED TO TALK TO SOMEONE
WHO WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.100
CHRISTIAN LIKED TO PRETEND
HE WAS MY BROTHER

37:02.200 --> 37:03.700
TAKING CARE OF
HIS LITTLE SISTER.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.300
BUT HE HAS SO MANY ISSUES.

37:06.300 --> 37:09.000
AFTER A WHILE, IT WAS JUST
TOO MUCH FOR ME.

37:09.100 --> 37:11.400
AND I HAVE MY OWN
ISSUES, TOO.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.800
NOW I FEEL LIKE
I'VE MADE EVERYTHING WORSE.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.500
HOW DO I KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO SEND HIM TO JAIL FOR KILLING ME?

37:17.500 --> 37:19.500
THE LAWYERS SAY, BASED
ON HIS MENTAL STATE,

37:19.600 --> 37:20.900
HE'LL STAY OUT
OF PRISON.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.400
SO HE'S GOING TO ROT
IN SOME AWFUL ASYLUM?

37:23.500 --> 37:27.500
FIONA, YOU HAVE MY WORD,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.800
I THINK WITH THE RIGHT
MEDICATION-

37:28.900 --> 37:33.200
YOUR WORD? THAT'S WHAT
CHRISTIAN'S DEPENDING ON?

37:33.300 --> 37:35.300
LOOK, ELI'S DONE EVERYTHING
HE CAN FOR BOTH OF YOU.

37:35.400 --> 37:38.400
NO. FIONA'S RIGHT.

37:38.500 --> 37:42.300
MY WORD HASN'T MEANT
MUCH, NOT TO HER.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.600
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

37:47.538 --> 37:48.800
REMEMBER THAT NIGHT
WHEN I CALLED

37:48.900 --> 37:51.500
AND I TOLD YOU THAT WE
COULDN'T WORK TOGETHER ANYMORE?

37:51.600 --> 37:55.200
BUT I KNOW, I KNOW YOU HAVE
FEELINGS FOR ME, I KNOW IT!

37:55.200 --> 37:57.300
NO, NO,
YOU ARE CONFUSED.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.400
NO, I'M NOT!

37:59.500 --> 38:00.600
I CAN FEEL IT.

38:00.700 --> 38:02.600
YOU ARE
A VERY NICE PERSON.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.500
I'VE ENJOYED
OUR SESSIONS.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.200
BUT THERE IS
NOTHING MORE THERE.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.500
I LIED.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.200
THERE WAS MORE.

38:13.300 --> 38:15.000
MUCH MORE.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.400
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.900
FIONA, YOU'VE SEEN
MY APARTMENT.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.900
I HAVE PICTURES OF YOU
EVERYWHERE.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.300
NEXT TO ALL OF YOUR
OTHER PATIENTS, SO WHAT?

38:25.400 --> 38:26.400
ALL THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT,

38:26.500 --> 38:27.900
DAY AFTER DAY,
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,

38:27.900 --> 38:30.100
WAS HOW I COULD
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.700
IF YOU WERE UNHAPPY,
SO WAS I.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.300
YOU DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT
ALL OF YOUR OTHER PATIENTS?

38:36.400 --> 38:39.700
FIONA, IF I CARED ABOUT THEM
ALL THAT MUCH, I'D LOSE MY MIND.

38:40.700 --> 38:43.100
IF I CARED ABOUT YOU
ANY MORE...

38:44.750 --> 38:46.500
I'D LOSE MY JOB.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.300
OK.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.500
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW?

38:59.800 --> 39:01.800
TAKE IT WITH YOU.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.500
WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING.

39:10.673 --> 39:12.100
WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?

39:12.200 --> 39:14.400
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE GOING.

39:19.443 --> 39:20.900
IT'S AMAZING.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.400
YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD DOCTOR,
YOU KNOW THAT?

39:30.500 --> 39:33.000
I'M NOT SO SURE.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.000
BE SURE.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.600
MY HEART WAS BROKEN,

39:37.700 --> 39:40.900
AND NOW IT'S FIXED.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.300
SHE'S GONE.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.500
MAN.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.600
IS IT ALWAYS LIKE THAT?

40:04.700 --> 40:06.600
NO.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.000
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER.

40:15.100 --> 40:15.900
COME ON.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.000
HEY.
HEY.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
EVERYBODY GOT
WHAT THEY WANTED?

40:31.100 --> 40:32.000
PERFECT.
OH, YEAH.

40:32.100 --> 40:34.800
HONEY, THEY'RE BEING POLITE.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.300
MELINDA ASKED FOR CHOPSTICKS,

40:36.400 --> 40:38.900
AND JIM ASKED
FOR LOW SODIUM SOY SAUCE.

40:38.900 --> 40:41.500
RIGHT. SORRY. SORRY.
BE RIGHT BACK.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.900
BAD ENOUGH YOU GUYS MAKE HIM
WORK AT THE STORE TOO, RIGHT?

40:45.000 --> 40:46.800
HE NEEDS 2 JOBS
IF HE'S GOING TO PAY

40:46.800 --> 40:49.000
FOR THAT VIDEO GAME
THAT HE'S SO ADDICTED TO.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.800
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
HE HAS NO TIME TO PLAY.

40:57.000 --> 40:57.800
WHAT?

40:57.900 --> 40:59.000
DO YOU THINK
I'M HARD ON HIM?

40:59.100 --> 41:01.300
NO. NOT AT ALL.
NOT US.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.000
YOU KNOW, PARENTING IS A
LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.500
AND WHEN YOU TWO
DECIDE TO HAVE KIDS,

41:05.600 --> 41:09.100
YOU WILL KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.000
WELL...

41:12.100 --> 41:14.000
HERE'S TO US
FINDING OUT SOMEDAY.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.200
SOON.

41:18.900 --> 41:21.000
HERE, HERE.
MMM.

41:26.350 --> 41:27.300
EXCUSE ME.

41:27.300 --> 41:29.000
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.200
HEY.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.800
WHAT'S WITH THAT EMAIL
YOU SENT ME?

41:41.800 --> 41:44.200
"COME SEE ME BEFORE YOU
LEAVE, IF NOT, BE CAREFUL."

41:44.300 --> 41:46.100
WHAT, DID YOU HAVE
ANOTHER BAD OMEN?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.400
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

41:48.500 --> 41:50.000
I MEAN, NO MATTER WHAT,
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.

41:50.100 --> 41:51.700
YOU'RE GOING TO
A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.300
THERE'S POLITICS,
SCARY FOOD.

41:53.300 --> 41:54.900
YOU CARE ABOUT ME.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.100
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN
SO MAD.

41:57.100 --> 41:59.600
I FIGURED IT OUT.
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO.

41:59.700 --> 42:01.900
OF COURSE I CARE.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.300
A LOT?

42:05.700 --> 42:08.400
YOU CARE ABOUT ME A LOT.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.400
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

42:15.500 --> 42:18.300
THAT YOU'RE ONE
OF MY BEST FRIENDS,

42:18.400 --> 42:22.100
AND THAT ALTHOUGH I FULL
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE TO GO,

42:22.200 --> 42:25.000
IT HURTS... TO KNOW
THAT YOU WOULD PICK

42:25.000 --> 42:28.200
AN OLD PILE
OF ARTIFACTS OVER ME?

42:31.800 --> 42:35.200
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

42:36.200 --> 42:38.000
HAPPY?

42:39.400 --> 42:41.300
CAN I HAVE A HUG
FOR THE ROAD,

42:41.400 --> 42:44.000
MAYBE A BIG SQUEEZY,
CHESTY ONE?

42:44.000 --> 42:45.600
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

42:45.700 --> 42:47.600
I KNOW I PUSHED IT,
I KNEW IT.

DON'T BE AN IDIOT,
BE SAFE.

42:54.600 --> 42:57.400
HEY, I'M COMING BACK HERE,

42:57.500 --> 42:59.900
AND I'M COMING BACK
SAFE AND SOUND, OK?
