WEBVTT

00:01.372 --> 00:05.376
(Gasping)

00:10.781 --> 00:14.684
(Gasping)

00:14.685 --> 00:16.416
Looks like a possible
methamphetamine overdose.

00:16.417 --> 00:20.020
(Sound distorts)

00:28.359 --> 00:30.660
Ah! (Grunts) Ah.

00:30.661 --> 00:32.632
Pupils are dilated. Ah!

00:32.633 --> 00:33.733
She needs fluids.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.106
Look at me. What did you take?

00:36.107 --> 00:37.367
Saline's up.

00:37.368 --> 00:39.409
You need to tell me
so that I can help you.

00:39.410 --> 00:41.671
Tu mox morieris!

00:41.672 --> 00:43.343
Was that Latin?

00:43.344 --> 00:45.245
(Vomits)

00:45.246 --> 00:47.577
(Coughs and laughs)

00:47.578 --> 00:49.380
Aah!

00:51.522 --> 00:52.752
Restraints! Now!

00:52.753 --> 00:54.724
Aah! Aah!

00:54.725 --> 00:56.726
Aah! (Grunting)

00:56.727 --> 00:58.057
(Snaps)

00:58.058 --> 00:59.129
(Monitor beeping erratically)

00:59.130 --> 01:00.460
She's crashing. Paddles.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.632
(Defibrillator whining)

01:02.633 --> 01:03.763
Clear!

01:03.764 --> 01:05.195
(Paddles thunk)

01:05.196 --> 01:06.566
(Whining continues)

01:06.567 --> 01:08.238
One more time. Come on. Clear.

01:08.239 --> 01:09.639
(Thunk)

01:09.640 --> 01:11.141
(Whining continues)

01:11.142 --> 01:12.272
Clear!

01:12.273 --> 01:14.074
(Thunk)

01:15.246 --> 01:18.108
(Paddles clunk)

01:18.109 --> 01:19.749
(Camera shutter
clicking, flash buzzing)

01:19.750 --> 01:21.551
The hallucinatory
behavior plus cardiac arrest

01:21.552 --> 01:23.653
are consistent with a
methamphetamine overdose.

01:23.654 --> 01:25.585
Okay. Witnesses said
she was hysterical,

01:25.586 --> 01:28.418
speaking Latin, and
she broke her own arm.

01:28.419 --> 01:30.190
Yeah, that's right.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.321
Doesn't that seem
a little extreme

01:31.322 --> 01:32.562
for a meth overdose?

01:32.563 --> 01:34.794
Each is a special kind of crazy.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.266
You don't know her name?

01:36.267 --> 01:37.427
No.

01:37.428 --> 01:39.269
She's never been in here before?

01:39.270 --> 01:40.570
Before someone dumped
her in my parking lot

01:40.571 --> 01:42.602
and took off? No.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.174
How'd she break her arm?

01:44.175 --> 01:46.636
She broke it trying to
twist out of the restraints.

01:46.637 --> 01:49.108
She was out of her head.
It... it goes with the territory.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.341
Isn't it your job to
protect your patients,

01:51.342 --> 01:52.742
even from themselves?

01:52.743 --> 01:55.285
Are you impugning my integrity?

01:55.286 --> 01:57.247
Oh, I'm sorry. Was I too subtle?

01:57.248 --> 01:58.548
Look, this clinic
scrapes by, all right?

01:58.549 --> 02:00.690
We do the best that
we can with patients

02:00.691 --> 02:02.792
that most hospitals
won't even touch. Mm.

02:02.793 --> 02:04.624
The girl was a train wreck.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.357
There just wasn't enough time.

02:07.358 --> 02:09.429
Listen, Dr. Dante.
Thanks for your time.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.202
We'll take it from here.

02:12.203 --> 02:13.903
Nurse.

02:13.904 --> 02:15.265
You okay?

02:15.266 --> 02:17.167
I took Latin in college.

02:17.168 --> 02:19.469
I... I understood
everything she said.

02:19.470 --> 02:21.341
And what was that?

02:21.342 --> 02:24.174
She said "tu mox
morieris." You're all...

02:24.175 --> 02:26.546
You're all going to
die. Anything else?

02:26.547 --> 02:28.348
Yeah. The room got colder

02:28.349 --> 02:30.880
the moment Dr. Dante
brought that poor girl in.

02:30.881 --> 02:32.882
I know it's gonna sound crazy,

02:32.883 --> 02:36.226
but it just felt like... evil.

02:36.227 --> 02:38.228
I've never seen
anything like it.

02:38.229 --> 02:40.490
You're right. It
does sound crazy.

02:40.491 --> 02:42.232
It's the truth.

02:42.233 --> 02:43.463
If you believe that,

02:43.464 --> 02:44.864
you shouldn't be
working in a medical clinic.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.236
Thank you.

02:46.237 --> 02:48.198
(Police radio chatter)

02:48.199 --> 02:50.340
Still think it's an overdose?

02:50.341 --> 02:53.403
I haven't heard anything
to make me think otherwise.

02:53.404 --> 02:55.645
Sounds a little weird to me.

02:55.646 --> 02:57.647
What about the
room getting cold?

02:57.648 --> 02:59.279
I don't know.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.813
She bumped into the thermostat.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.961
(Curtis) C.S.U. Just
took fingernail evidence

03:11.962 --> 03:13.593
and did a sexual assault kit.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.225
Find anything interesting?

03:15.226 --> 03:17.227
Nope. But d.N.A. Did come
back negative for demon blood.

03:17.228 --> 03:18.598
But we're still waiting
on the werewolf hairs.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.929
I'll keep you in the loop.

03:19.930 --> 03:21.931
Dude, that's not
funny. That's not cool.

03:21.932 --> 03:23.633
Thank you, Ethan.

03:23.634 --> 03:25.375
I'm glad somebody's acting
like a scientist around here.

03:25.376 --> 03:27.537
My Nana always told me
not to make fun of the spirits.

03:27.538 --> 03:28.878
Okay? It's bad Karma.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.380
And I spoke too soon.

03:30.381 --> 03:32.282
Okay, listen up.

03:32.283 --> 03:35.385
When a 17-year-old girl dies

03:35.386 --> 03:38.718
from an acute cardiac
event, it's usually due to drugs.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.421
Pending confirmation
from the toxicology report,

03:41.422 --> 03:42.922
cause of death
will most likely be

03:42.923 --> 03:46.326
cardiac arrest due to
methamphetamine overdose.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.527
Are you sure it's that simple?

03:47.528 --> 03:48.698
She has infected skin lesions,

03:48.699 --> 03:50.530
severe eye congestion...

03:50.531 --> 03:51.861
Par for the course.

03:51.862 --> 03:53.363
Drug addicts usually
have those issues.

03:53.364 --> 03:54.864
Well, isn't it a little extreme,

03:54.865 --> 03:56.406
even for an addict?

03:56.407 --> 03:58.007
The cause of death
could be sepsis.

03:58.008 --> 04:00.810
No, sepsis would've
taken more time to develop.

04:00.811 --> 04:02.372
This was quick.

04:02.373 --> 04:03.513
What? Spit it out.

04:03.514 --> 04:04.844
I just don't think

04:04.845 --> 04:06.516
we can explain this
all the way with drugs.

04:06.517 --> 04:07.677
Really?

04:07.678 --> 04:09.319
Can we talk for one
second about the fact

04:09.320 --> 04:11.321
that she broke her own arm?

04:11.322 --> 04:12.782
I mean, explain
that to me, please.

04:12.783 --> 04:14.984
Because it's kind
of freaking me out.

04:14.985 --> 04:17.287
(Cell phone rings)

04:17.288 --> 04:18.888
(Ring)

04:18.889 --> 04:20.360
(Beeps)

04:20.361 --> 04:21.691
Tommy, what do you got?

04:21.692 --> 04:23.333
I just e-mailed you some photos.

04:23.334 --> 04:24.994
We got a hit on
Jane Doe's prints.

04:24.995 --> 04:26.666
Her name is Rebecca banks.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.498
17-year-old high school senior,

04:28.499 --> 04:30.300
honor roll, glee club.

04:30.301 --> 04:32.001
She looks like an angel.

04:32.002 --> 04:33.573
Yeah, a fallen angel.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.044
She's been picked up on
possession of methamphetamine.

04:35.045 --> 04:37.607
I'm headed out to malvern
right now to notify the parents.

04:37.608 --> 04:38.778
You care to join?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.610
On my way.

04:40.611 --> 04:42.352
(Beep) Okay.

04:42.353 --> 04:46.015
Curtis, why don't you and
Ethan do the autopsy yourselves?

04:46.016 --> 04:49.589
Let me know if I'm
right or if I'm right.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.462
Wh...

04:57.528 --> 05:01.300
(Footsteps approaching)

05:01.301 --> 05:03.302
Adam still on vacation?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.604
Yeah, so he says.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.436
I think he's in Atlantic city

05:06.437 --> 05:07.777
falling in love,

05:07.778 --> 05:09.909
over and over again. (Chuckles)

05:09.910 --> 05:12.613
(Knocks)

05:13.844 --> 05:15.014
Hi.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.486
I'm detective Sullivan

05:16.487 --> 05:17.887
from the Philly p.D.

05:17.888 --> 05:20.821
Could we talk to
your parents, please?

05:23.354 --> 05:25.495
We're very sorry
about your loss.

05:25.496 --> 05:26.656
(Crying)

05:26.657 --> 05:29.530
Chelsea, stop crying.

05:31.061 --> 05:32.532
(Clock chimes)

05:32.533 --> 05:35.465
(Door opens)

05:35.466 --> 05:37.567
(Chimes)

05:37.568 --> 05:39.609
(Door closes)

05:39.610 --> 05:42.071
How did Rebecca die?

05:42.072 --> 05:45.344
We believe it was
a drug overdose.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.676
I'm not surprised.

05:46.677 --> 05:49.078
She chose a path of sin.

05:49.079 --> 05:51.651
Sin hangs over all of us,

05:51.652 --> 05:53.954
and then sometimes it falls.

05:56.387 --> 05:57.927
So you knew about
her drug abuse?

05:57.928 --> 05:59.929
It's the reason I kicked
her out of the house

05:59.930 --> 06:01.761
two months ago.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.763
Her sin was
infecting this family,

06:03.764 --> 06:05.765
so I had to let her go.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.438
Had she contacted
you since then?

06:08.439 --> 06:09.599
She called...

06:09.600 --> 06:10.970
Laura.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.402
She called once,

06:12.403 --> 06:13.743
two weeks ago,

06:13.744 --> 06:15.875
wanting to come home.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.578
I told her she was no
longer part of this family.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.380
She didn't call again.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.454
You disapprove?

06:24.955 --> 06:27.587
You don't turn your
back on your child.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.758
Megan, just...

06:28.759 --> 06:30.520
No, it's okay.

06:30.521 --> 06:31.821
Do you have children?

06:31.822 --> 06:32.922
A daughter.

06:32.923 --> 06:34.393
Does she make you proud?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.495
Very.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.096
I'm glad. That's
the way it should be.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.128
Now imagine

06:39.129 --> 06:41.130
all that promise
going horribly wrong

06:41.131 --> 06:42.572
in the blink of an eye.

06:42.573 --> 06:45.735
Imagine that little girl
you taught to ride a bike

06:45.736 --> 06:48.438
letting drugs turn her
into a complete stranger.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.409
What do you do then?

06:50.410 --> 06:53.042
Everything in my
power to save her.

06:53.043 --> 06:54.413
Of course.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.446
Because when
our children go bad,

06:56.447 --> 06:58.688
our dreams get
flushed down with them.

06:58.689 --> 07:02.522
So you sacrifice everything
you have to save them.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.153
Until one day,

07:04.154 --> 07:06.926
you realize, you can't.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.829
You can only get
sucked down with them.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.501
(Tommy) Okay, we'll contact you

07:11.502 --> 07:14.103
as soon as the
toxicology report comes in.

07:14.104 --> 07:16.035
Then we'll know everything
that was in her system.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.708
You haven't been
listening to me.

07:18.709 --> 07:21.641
I don't follow.

07:21.642 --> 07:25.044
It wasn't drugs that
killed my Rebecca.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.648
It was the devil.

07:31.782 --> 07:33.483
This is no surprise.

07:33.484 --> 07:35.154
Autopsy confirmed
cause of death...

07:35.155 --> 07:37.126
Myocardial infarction.

07:37.127 --> 07:39.028
Still doesn't tell us
what stopped the heart.

07:39.029 --> 07:42.191
Curtis, just take
a... Take a look.

07:42.192 --> 07:45.194
How is this possible?

07:45.195 --> 07:47.136
That guy was a creep.

07:47.137 --> 07:49.199
No wonder Rebecca
turned to drugs.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.609
(Cell phone rings)

07:59.610 --> 08:01.511
(Beeps)

08:01.512 --> 08:03.212
Yes, Ethan.

08:03.213 --> 08:05.685
Um...

08:05.686 --> 08:09.018
You know what? You... you
really need to see this for yourself.

08:09.019 --> 08:10.660
Mm-hmm.

08:10.661 --> 08:12.523
It's about Rebecca banks.

08:18.198 --> 08:25.636
♪♪♪

08:26.076 --> 08:28.107
(Switch clicks)

08:28.108 --> 08:30.710
(Ethan) They just
appeared out of nowhere.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.942
When we started the autopsy,
there wasn't a single bruise.

08:32.943 --> 08:35.014
By the time we finished,
they were everywhere.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.546
Could somebody have done this

08:36.547 --> 08:37.947
while you and Curtis
were out of the room?

08:37.948 --> 08:39.148
No way. No.

08:39.149 --> 08:40.890
We were... we were
just outside the door.

08:40.891 --> 08:42.792
Everyone, relax.

08:42.793 --> 08:45.024
This is easily
explained. (Clicks)

08:45.025 --> 08:47.957
Antemortem bruising
sometimes has a latency period.

08:47.958 --> 08:49.999
The cold air in the
morgue tightened the skin

08:50.000 --> 08:51.801
and brought out the bruises.

08:51.802 --> 08:53.232
Well, I don't think you're
fully appreciating the fact

08:53.233 --> 08:55.234
that the body is
covered in crosses.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.637
I mean, this is
unequivocally weird.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.109
Really? 'Cause it
makes sense to me.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.812
I think that Rebecca came
home strung out on meth.

09:02.813 --> 09:04.313
All Caleb saw was evil,

09:04.314 --> 09:06.275
and he used a cross to beat
the devil out of her. (Mutters)

09:06.276 --> 09:08.017
But that's not what killed her.

09:08.018 --> 09:10.049
Cause of death is
still drug overdose.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.981
Actually, I just got
the tox screen results.

09:11.982 --> 09:16.285
No drugs were detected
in Rebecca's system.

09:16.286 --> 09:18.127
So what killed
her now, Dr. Hunt?

09:18.128 --> 09:20.960
There's still a
scientific explanation.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.863
Yeah, I really, really
want there to be one.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.164
(Sighs)

09:25.165 --> 09:26.966
Whatever caused
Rebecca to exhibit

09:26.967 --> 09:28.838
hallucinatory
behavior at the clinic

09:28.839 --> 09:31.240
is probably the same thing
that caused her heart to stop.

09:31.241 --> 09:33.943
A sudden release of adrenaline
can shock the heart, too.

09:33.944 --> 09:35.875
Maybe something
scared the hell out of her.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.346
What about the house?
(Sets chart down)

09:37.347 --> 09:38.948
It's early 20th century.

09:38.949 --> 09:41.050
It's probably filled with
environmental toxins...

09:41.051 --> 09:42.581
Mold, lead in the paint.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.884
Have you ever heard of
environmental toxins doing this?

09:44.885 --> 09:47.186
No. You got a better
idea, Dr. Sullivan?

09:47.187 --> 09:49.058
We need a warrant fast.

09:49.059 --> 09:50.990
Could you get your boss
to sweet-talk the d.A.?

09:50.991 --> 09:51.922
I will check.

09:51.923 --> 09:53.623
Ethan, Curtis, I want you

09:53.624 --> 09:55.925
to oversee the c.S.U.S
when they do the tests.

09:55.926 --> 09:57.266
I'm not going over
there. Oh, hell, no.

09:57.267 --> 09:58.798
You're crazy. Stop it!

09:58.799 --> 10:00.700
Something killed this
girl. It was not the devil.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.001
Then you go to the
house. Mm-hmm.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.835
You are scientists. Act like it.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.376
You should talk to Caleb.

10:07.377 --> 10:09.308
About what, the
little cross bruises

10:09.309 --> 10:10.840
we don't even know
that he gave her?

10:10.841 --> 10:12.611
We both saw him with his family.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.113
Could he have acted
any more suspicious?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.986
It doesn't matter, Megan.
You don't have any evidence.

10:16.987 --> 10:18.147
You can't even tell
me what killed her.

10:18.148 --> 10:19.318
Okay, fine. (Clicks button)

10:19.319 --> 10:21.250
Look me in the eye

10:21.251 --> 10:23.122
and tell me you don't think
he's capable of murder.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.894
Okay.

10:24.895 --> 10:26.726
I'll put him under surveillance.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.357
(Bell dings)

10:28.358 --> 10:29.899
A magazine interview?

10:29.900 --> 10:32.031
Yeah, I think I could
squeeze that in.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.963
No, it's always a pleasure
for me to talk about

10:33.964 --> 10:35.634
the important work
that we do here

10:35.635 --> 10:37.106
and to get the
chance to shine a light

10:37.107 --> 10:39.939
on my incredibly talented team.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.711
The day after
tomorrow's perfect.

10:41.712 --> 10:44.974
Okay. (Laughs)
I'll see you then.

10:44.975 --> 10:46.015
Smooth.

10:46.016 --> 10:47.146
Too smooth?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.247
We'll see.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.019
What's up?

10:50.020 --> 10:51.681
I need your help
getting a warrant.

10:51.682 --> 10:53.022
You mean you
need me to call Dan.

10:53.023 --> 10:54.353
For what?

10:54.354 --> 10:56.355
I'm still looking for
c.O.D. On Rebecca banks.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.758
I want to test her home
for environmental toxins.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.060
Banks. The possible suicide?

11:01.061 --> 11:04.093
No, that's the lambert
case. Banks died at the clinic.

11:04.094 --> 11:06.065
Right. Of course. Yes.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.238
Sorry. I'll call Dan now.

11:09.239 --> 11:12.902
Work and politics,
quite a juggling act.

11:12.903 --> 11:14.974
Don't drop the ball.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.407
(Telephone rings)

11:18.408 --> 11:19.909
Kate Murphy.

11:19.910 --> 11:22.081
(Bell tolling)

11:22.082 --> 11:24.083
(Indistinct conversations)

11:24.084 --> 11:26.055
Chelsea, you got a minute?

11:26.056 --> 11:27.887
Please leave me alone.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.018
Listen, Chelsea,
we still don't know

11:29.019 --> 11:30.359
what killed your sister yet,

11:30.360 --> 11:31.891
but I'm here to talk to
you about your father.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.022
I can't do that. I'm sorry.

11:33.023 --> 11:35.464
Why, you afraid of him?

11:35.465 --> 11:37.326
Look, I grew up in
a tough household.

11:37.327 --> 11:39.298
Perfect, happy family
at church on sundays,

11:39.299 --> 11:41.130
but at home, different story.

11:41.131 --> 11:43.132
My father used the fear
of god to keep us in line.

11:43.133 --> 11:45.004
If that didn't work,
he'd use his fists.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.175
We learn through pain.

11:46.176 --> 11:47.937
He was showing
you love to help you.

11:47.938 --> 11:50.039
I don't doubt that he loved me.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.041
I'm just saying, he did
more damage than good.

11:52.042 --> 11:54.283
Kids should not be
afraid of their parents.

11:54.284 --> 11:57.286
So what's going on
inside that house, Chelsea?

11:57.287 --> 12:00.489
Did your father hit Rebecca?

12:00.490 --> 12:02.191
No.

12:02.192 --> 12:03.352
Did he hurt her in any way?

12:03.353 --> 12:04.723
No.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.055
Rebecca came home last week,

12:06.056 --> 12:07.426
begging daddy for help.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.959
She was really, really sick.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.961
I wanted to take
her to the doctor,

12:11.962 --> 12:14.003
but daddy told us to
put our faith in god.

12:14.004 --> 12:16.005
But she got worse.

12:16.006 --> 12:18.167
And I got weak.

12:18.168 --> 12:19.869
(Voice breaking) I snuck
her out of the house,

12:19.870 --> 12:21.911
drove her to the
clinic, and left her there.

12:21.912 --> 12:24.043
You defied your father.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.514
What did he do
when he found out?

12:25.515 --> 12:28.077
He didn't hit me if
that's what you're asking.

12:28.078 --> 12:30.279
Daddy said it was up
to god to punish me.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.450
No, Chelsea.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.082
You're the only one
who tried to help.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.423
You don't understand.

12:34.424 --> 12:36.526
Our family lives
under a great sin.

12:41.031 --> 12:42.261
Oh, no.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.292
Mm.

12:43.293 --> 12:45.965
This is the last
place I want to be.

12:45.966 --> 12:49.869
Well, at least we
have each other, right?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.100
Right?

12:51.101 --> 12:53.302
Curtis, you take the basement.

12:53.303 --> 12:55.144
I'll check the attic.

12:55.145 --> 12:57.006
(Sighs)

12:57.007 --> 12:59.008
We just lost our little girl,

12:59.009 --> 13:00.950
and instead of
letting us grieve,

13:00.951 --> 13:01.981
you treat us like criminals.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.953
This is for your
family's safety.

13:03.954 --> 13:05.784
We want to make sure
the house is free of toxins

13:05.785 --> 13:07.857
so nobody else
gets sick. (Sighs)

13:07.858 --> 13:09.989
You'll be back in before
nightfall. Just stay local.

13:09.990 --> 13:14.024
(Police radio chatter)

13:19.900 --> 13:23.432
(Filtered breathing)

13:23.433 --> 13:26.977
Don't touch nothing,
and it won't touch you.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.315
(Clicks)

13:44.955 --> 13:47.027
Who does this?

13:48.258 --> 13:51.001
Oh, good to see you here.

13:52.602 --> 13:53.933
Breathe.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.505
You got to breathe.

13:56.506 --> 13:58.207
Oh, lord.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.209
This isn't good at all.

14:00.210 --> 14:02.072
Oh, hell.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.076
Okay.

14:11.081 --> 14:12.281
Aah!

14:12.282 --> 14:13.923
Oh! Oh! Oh!

14:13.924 --> 14:16.185
(Laughs)

14:16.186 --> 14:18.087
Not so brave now, huh?

14:18.088 --> 14:20.930
Boy, you almost lost your
life and didn't even know it.

14:20.931 --> 14:22.861
Admit it. You're creeped out.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.094
And you're not? Oh, no, I
am. I'm glad you're here, man.

14:25.095 --> 14:27.036
You find anything interesting?

14:27.037 --> 14:30.239
Just this. Looks like
someone's got a pen pal.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.001
(Gasps)

14:32.002 --> 14:34.244
Ethan, check that out.

14:36.206 --> 14:37.346
Take a picture.

14:37.347 --> 14:38.377
(Camera shutter clicks)

14:38.378 --> 14:40.349
Oh. Oh.

14:40.350 --> 14:41.650
Ohh.

14:41.651 --> 14:43.053
(Click)

14:46.256 --> 14:48.217
(Exhales deeply)

14:48.218 --> 14:50.519
It's a tooth.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.091
What in the hell?

14:52.092 --> 14:53.392
"Hell" being the operative word.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.424
(Click)

14:55.425 --> 14:57.226
(Megan) So whose tooth is it?

14:57.227 --> 14:59.298
It wasn't Rebecca's.
She has a full set.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.370
Could it belong to
one of her sisters?

15:01.371 --> 15:02.631
That's what we thought

15:02.632 --> 15:04.503
until the g.C. Mass spec
found traces of radium.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.336
Radium? Didn't they put
radium in toothpaste in the '30s?

15:07.337 --> 15:09.338
Mm-hmm. Until
somebody figured out

15:09.339 --> 15:11.410
radioactivity was a problem.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.542
So what's an
80-year-old bloody molar

15:13.543 --> 15:15.544
doing in the banks' basement?

15:15.545 --> 15:17.216
Googled it.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.547
This man, Atticus aldrich,

15:18.548 --> 15:22.952
killed his three daughters
in the basement in 1934.

15:22.953 --> 15:25.394
Smashed their faces
in with a sledgehammer.

15:25.395 --> 15:29.128
We think the molar is a
remnant of those murders.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.630
I'm cold. Do you feel cold?

15:31.631 --> 15:34.133
(Megan) Atticus is a
dead ringer for Caleb.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.636
Uh-huh. That's because
he's Caleb's grandfather.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.509
He also believed that his family
was possessed by the devil.

15:40.510 --> 15:43.442
Atticus was diagnosed as
a paranoid schizophrenic.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.444
Spent the rest of his
life in a mental hospital.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.177
This is the sin that Chelsea
said is hanging over her family.

15:48.178 --> 15:50.119
Maybe Caleb is repeating
the sins of the grandfather,

15:50.120 --> 15:52.221
killing his daughters
off one by one.

15:52.222 --> 15:53.983
He might crack if
we confront him.

15:53.984 --> 15:56.225
I'll have surveillance
bring him in.

15:56.226 --> 15:58.287
They're all here.

15:58.288 --> 16:01.130
Sat down for coffee
about a half an hour ago.

16:01.131 --> 16:04.333
(People speaking indistinctly)

16:04.334 --> 16:06.096
They're gone.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.697
(Caleb) Chelsea!

16:08.698 --> 16:10.069
Let me in. (Crying)

16:10.070 --> 16:11.300
I can help you. (Knock on door)

16:11.301 --> 16:12.671
(Rattles)

16:12.672 --> 16:14.103
Come on.

16:14.104 --> 16:16.206
(Grunts)

16:21.051 --> 16:23.083
(Cries)

16:27.057 --> 16:29.759
(Growling)

16:31.621 --> 16:33.992
(Continues growling)

16:33.993 --> 16:36.195
Not you, too. No.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.767
(Deepened voice) Don't touch
me, you son of a bitch. (Growls)

16:38.768 --> 16:40.169
No. Come out.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.271
Come here. Come here.

16:42.272 --> 16:46.175
(Growling)

16:46.176 --> 16:48.207
Come here. (Grunts)

16:48.208 --> 16:50.779
Come here. No. Come here. No.

16:50.780 --> 16:53.282
Calm. Calm. (Continues growling)

16:53.283 --> 16:54.513
Calm.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.746
(Normal voice) God is
punishing me for Rebecca.

16:57.747 --> 17:01.120
(Panting) I'm so sorry, daddy.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.592
So am I, sweetheart.

17:03.593 --> 17:05.625
So am I.

17:13.403 --> 17:14.563
(Kate) All right, where
are we on finding Caleb?

17:14.564 --> 17:16.235
Still no sign of him.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.367
(Tommy) No credit card activity,
no trace of cell phone usage.

17:18.368 --> 17:20.709
But then again, Caleb
doesn't believe in them, so...

17:20.710 --> 17:22.571
Okay. You know that
even when you find Caleb,

17:22.572 --> 17:25.774
there's not one shred of
evidence that he killed Rebecca.

17:25.775 --> 17:27.376
You have no reason to hold him.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.178
Don't worry. We'll find
him. And when we do,

17:29.179 --> 17:31.220
he'll give us a reason.

17:31.221 --> 17:32.621
Kate is right.

17:32.622 --> 17:34.283
The evidence in this case

17:34.284 --> 17:36.285
has lead to one dead
end after another.

17:36.286 --> 17:38.357
Something killed that girl.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.289
Why can't I see it?

17:40.290 --> 17:42.291
Maybe science can't
explain everything.

17:42.292 --> 17:44.363
Tommy, enough
with the spooky talk.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.196
The devil is the
excuse, not the cause.

17:47.197 --> 17:49.398
At the very least, Caleb
is guilty of bad parenting,

17:49.399 --> 17:51.140
if not murder.

17:51.141 --> 17:52.401
I'm not saying the devil did it.

17:52.402 --> 17:54.373
I've just been doing this
job long enough to know

17:54.374 --> 17:56.275
that evil can be
baked into people.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.377
And just because you can't
see it under a microscope

17:58.378 --> 18:00.279
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.282
You spent too much
time in church as a kid.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.783
Maybe you didn't spend enough.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.285
(Elevator bell dings) Mm.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.289
(Indistinct conversations)

18:18.198 --> 18:20.369
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

18:20.370 --> 18:23.101
Does it bother you
we don't go to church?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.333
(Laughs) Okay.

18:24.334 --> 18:26.205
Random.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.706
Why are you asking me this, mom?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.878
Because...

18:29.879 --> 18:32.381
Some people find

18:32.382 --> 18:33.442
comfort in it,

18:33.443 --> 18:35.244
and if you're curious about it,

18:35.245 --> 18:38.147
I don't want to
keep you from it.

18:38.148 --> 18:40.619
Well, I have gone before.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.391
What? You have?

18:42.392 --> 18:44.593
A few times, with friends.

18:44.594 --> 18:47.296
(Huffs) Why didn't you tell me?

18:47.297 --> 18:50.299
Because you don't
like to talk about god,

18:50.300 --> 18:54.204
because you can't explain it,
and you hate when that happens.

18:56.506 --> 18:59.269
Do you believe in god?

19:01.371 --> 19:03.372
I...

19:03.373 --> 19:06.345
See god in science.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.416
Because it explains everything?

19:07.417 --> 19:09.518
Almost everything.

19:09.519 --> 19:11.851
Stop texting and
do your homework.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.924
Ah. Hey, lace. What's up?

19:15.925 --> 19:17.155
What?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.927
Unexpected good news.

19:18.928 --> 19:22.431
C.s.u. Techs found epithelials
under Rebecca's fingernails,

19:22.432 --> 19:24.293
and we got a d.N.A. Profile hit.

19:24.294 --> 19:25.434
Caleb?

19:25.435 --> 19:27.296
No. Todd Higgins.

19:27.297 --> 19:29.338
He was arrested five
years ago for a d.U.I.

19:29.339 --> 19:30.799
He was never convicted.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.272
Where do I find
this Todd Higgins?

19:33.273 --> 19:35.704
(Bells tolling)

19:35.705 --> 19:38.176
I've known the banks
family a long time.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.610
Rebecca was a lovely
girl. She'll be missed.

19:41.611 --> 19:42.911
What happened?

19:42.912 --> 19:44.483
We're hoping you could tell us.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.256
We found your skin under
Rebecca's fingernails.

19:47.257 --> 19:50.560
You were with her shortly
before she died. Why?

19:55.325 --> 19:56.825
(Tommy) Do you have a confession

19:56.826 --> 19:58.527
to make, pastor?

19:58.528 --> 20:00.198
I know how this looks,

20:00.199 --> 20:02.631
but I assure you, I was
only trying to help Rebecca.

20:02.632 --> 20:04.833
Why'd she have
to defend herself?

20:04.834 --> 20:06.835
I was performing an exorcism.

20:06.836 --> 20:09.578
Caleb begged me
to help, so I did.

20:09.579 --> 20:11.680
You thought she was possessed.

20:11.681 --> 20:14.343
I didn't believe
it myself at first.

20:14.344 --> 20:17.546
I figured she was
just using meth again.

20:17.547 --> 20:20.218
But when I looked in her eyes,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.751
Satan was staring back at me.

20:22.752 --> 20:26.595
Based on what... Evidence?

20:26.596 --> 20:28.557
She spoke fluent Latin to me...

20:28.558 --> 20:30.759
A language that
she's never studied.

20:30.760 --> 20:34.333
I speak a little Latin. Do
I need an exorcism, too?

20:34.334 --> 20:35.834
You weren't there.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.806
If you had been, you'd believe.

20:37.807 --> 20:39.608
Rebecca had
cross-marked bruises.

20:39.609 --> 20:42.371
Did you strike her with that?

20:42.372 --> 20:44.613
My methods were
extreme but necessary.

20:44.614 --> 20:48.717
Since when is it necessary
to assault a 17-year-old girl?

20:48.718 --> 20:51.450
Do you know why the
devil attacks a child?

20:51.451 --> 20:52.721
To make you despair.

20:52.722 --> 20:54.623
Rebecca was not possessed.

20:54.624 --> 20:56.285
She needed a doctor.

20:56.286 --> 20:58.357
You cost her her life.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.359
Caleb and his
family are missing.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.591
Do you have any idea where
they might be right now?

21:02.592 --> 21:04.433
No, but he called
me this morning.

21:04.434 --> 21:06.264
Why?

21:06.265 --> 21:07.896
Chelsea is sick.

21:07.897 --> 21:09.438
He wanted another exorcism.

21:09.439 --> 21:10.739
Yes, but I refused.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.270
Can I see your
cell phone, please?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.403
I'm gonna try to trace this.

21:14.404 --> 21:16.345
Why'd you say no
this time, father?

21:16.346 --> 21:19.007
Because I was afraid.

21:19.008 --> 21:21.810
I adjure you, ancient serpent,

21:21.811 --> 21:24.313
by the judge of the
living and the dead.

21:24.314 --> 21:26.415
(Deepened voice)
Get away from me!

21:26.416 --> 21:27.816
I adjure you... (Growling)

21:27.817 --> 21:30.719
To depart again from
this servant of god,

21:30.720 --> 21:34.393
whom almighty god
hath made in his image.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.764
Yield. (Spits)

21:35.765 --> 21:37.566
Oh!

21:37.567 --> 21:41.299
Cry! Scared little Chelsea's
trapped in here with me,

21:41.300 --> 21:43.071
and she's never been happier.

21:43.072 --> 21:44.333
(Grunts) (Laura) Oh, god.

21:44.334 --> 21:47.906
(Laughs evilly)

21:47.907 --> 21:50.308
Do it again, you
pathetic coward!

21:50.309 --> 21:52.741
Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.

21:52.742 --> 21:55.414
Yield, serpent, with this holy
water. (Screams indistinctly)

21:55.415 --> 21:59.788
For it is the power of Christ who
compels you. No! It burns! It burns!

21:59.789 --> 22:00.949
Yield!

22:00.950 --> 22:02.320
No!

22:02.321 --> 22:05.824
Back away! Back away, everybody!

22:05.825 --> 22:06.995
Move it.

22:06.996 --> 22:08.658
(Metal clinks)

22:14.003 --> 22:15.835
(Growls)

22:17.437 --> 22:20.809
(Groaning)

22:20.810 --> 22:22.371
(Blood bubbling)

22:22.372 --> 22:24.443
She punctured her lung.
It's collapsed. Call 9-1-1 now.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.476
E.m.t. 1259 Smith
Daniel road, now.

22:27.477 --> 22:28.817
(Growls)

22:28.818 --> 22:32.080
(Normal voice) A quarter
for your jacket, pumpkin?

22:32.081 --> 22:33.452
(Panting)

22:33.453 --> 22:35.424
What did you just say?

22:35.425 --> 22:38.457
A quarter for your
jacket, pumpkin?

22:38.458 --> 22:40.989
Don't forget.

22:40.990 --> 22:42.360
(Coughs)

22:42.361 --> 22:44.663
(Panting) She can't breathe!

22:44.664 --> 22:47.996
I-I gotta inflate the lung.
Give me a pen! I need a pen!

22:47.997 --> 22:50.939
(Choking)

22:50.940 --> 22:53.942
(Gasping)

22:53.943 --> 22:55.874
(Air hissing) Okay.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.746
Okay. There you go.

22:57.747 --> 22:58.747
There you go.

22:58.748 --> 23:00.008
Breathe.

23:00.009 --> 23:01.550
(Gasping)

23:01.551 --> 23:05.854
(Choking)

23:05.855 --> 23:08.858
Damn it. She's aspirating.

23:15.465 --> 23:17.566
(Indistinct conversations)

23:17.567 --> 23:19.598
She had a tension pneumothorax.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.970
I inflated her lung, but
I-I really had to wing it.

23:21.971 --> 23:23.802
We'll take it from here.

23:23.803 --> 23:27.105
You had no right to interfere!

23:27.106 --> 23:29.438
Your daughter needs a doctor.

23:29.439 --> 23:30.979
She needs god

23:30.980 --> 23:33.682
or she'll suffer the
same fate as Rebecca.

23:33.683 --> 23:37.446
Rebecca was dying while
you were busy praying.

23:37.447 --> 23:39.087
Take some responsibility.

23:39.088 --> 23:41.189
You're an instrument
of the devil.

23:41.190 --> 23:43.952
The only devil in
Chelsea's life is you,

23:43.953 --> 23:47.626
and if you're not gonna
do what's best for her, I will.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.558
Get him out of here.

23:49.559 --> 23:52.531
(Siren wailing)

23:52.532 --> 23:54.664
(Police radio chatter)

24:01.471 --> 24:04.172
(Megan) I spoke
to the attending.

24:04.173 --> 24:07.476
Chelsea's not responding to
the broad-spectrum antibiotics.

24:07.477 --> 24:09.648
Any idea what made her sick?

24:09.649 --> 24:11.820
No. He suspected
drug intoxication,

24:11.821 --> 24:14.052
but her blood screen is clean.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.955
It's just like Rebecca.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.958
(Indistinct conversations)

24:19.959 --> 24:22.962
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:25.164 --> 24:26.635
(Man) Dr. Hayes to radiology.

24:26.636 --> 24:29.067
She's getting worse, isn't she?

24:29.068 --> 24:30.799
Let's give it a little time.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.470
Let me take her home.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.602
Please?

24:33.603 --> 24:35.704
Hannah, this is the
best place for her.

24:35.705 --> 24:39.678
No. God can't protect her here.

24:39.679 --> 24:42.110
Is that why you're
here, to protect her?

24:42.111 --> 24:44.152
I can't lose another sister.

24:44.153 --> 24:47.686
I'm gonna do everything I can
to make sure that doesn't happen.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.789
Would you pray with me?

24:51.761 --> 24:53.823
No, I'm sorry. I can't.

24:55.595 --> 24:58.667
I was like you once...

24:58.668 --> 25:00.068
A nonbeliever.

25:00.069 --> 25:01.499
Really?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.701
Yes.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.974
Rebecca was my older
sister. I worshipped her.

25:05.975 --> 25:07.576
When daddy kicked
her out of the house,

25:07.577 --> 25:09.878
I hated him for it. I hated god.

25:09.879 --> 25:13.612
I wanted to go
with her, to be free.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.213
So what happened?

25:15.214 --> 25:18.887
Daddy showed me that
Rebecca really wasn't free at all.

25:18.888 --> 25:21.620
She was Satan's prisoner,

25:21.621 --> 25:23.291
and drugs were the chains.

25:23.292 --> 25:26.955
Hannah, I know you
don't want to hear this,

25:26.956 --> 25:30.899
but the devil did not
make your sister sick.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.761
I think it was your father.

25:32.762 --> 25:34.863
I don't know what he
gave them. You're wrong.

25:34.864 --> 25:36.665
What if I'm right?

25:36.666 --> 25:39.168
What's stopping him from
doing the same thing to you?

25:41.571 --> 25:44.573
Pain is the only thing
the devil understands.

25:44.574 --> 25:46.214
Keep telling yourself that.
We're wasting time here.

25:46.215 --> 25:48.146
Chelsea needs me by her side.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.648
It's not happening.

25:49.649 --> 25:52.120
Then I'm not talking.
I want a lawyer.

25:52.121 --> 25:53.652
Oh, you're gonna get one,

25:53.653 --> 25:55.824
but I want you to
listen to me closely.

25:55.825 --> 25:57.626
I'm gonna make it my
personal mission to make sure

25:57.627 --> 26:00.789
that you rot in prison for
what you did to your daughters.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.992
You want to see
the face of the devil?

26:03.993 --> 26:05.935
Take a look in the mirror.

26:07.897 --> 26:09.198
No?

26:10.800 --> 26:12.171
Fine.

26:15.645 --> 26:18.206
(Door opens)

26:18.207 --> 26:19.809
(Door closes)

26:24.654 --> 26:27.015
(Sighs)

26:27.016 --> 26:29.057
I don't know what to
tell you, Mrs. Banks.

26:29.058 --> 26:30.659
I have no idea why
your daughters are

26:30.660 --> 26:31.920
acting the way they are,

26:31.921 --> 26:34.192
but your husband is
looking pretty damn guilty.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.225
Everything Caleb has done,
he's done to save our girls.

26:37.226 --> 26:40.098
Is that so? Did he tell
you about grandpa Atticus

26:40.099 --> 26:42.370
and what he did to his daughters
in your house 78 years ago?

26:42.371 --> 26:44.032
(Whispers) Don't speak of it.

26:44.033 --> 26:46.174
Caleb is killing his daughters
and blaming the devil,

26:46.175 --> 26:47.706
just like Atticus.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.977
No.

26:48.978 --> 26:51.379
No, the devil is punishing
us for Atticus' sin.

26:51.380 --> 26:53.943
All Caleb has done
is try to stop him.

26:57.146 --> 26:59.217
And now Chelsea's defenseless.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.618
Well, then help me.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.851
What did Caleb do to them?

27:03.693 --> 27:05.794
Nothing.

27:05.795 --> 27:08.927
Oh, Laura.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.899
You're not afraid of the devil.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.802
You're afraid of Caleb.

27:13.803 --> 27:15.964
I'm afraid he'll
never forgive me.

27:15.965 --> 27:17.906
For what?

27:17.907 --> 27:19.708
Bringing Satan
back into our house.

27:19.709 --> 27:22.011
What'd you do?

27:25.014 --> 27:28.416
Caleb doesn't believe in
medications... of any kind.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.749
He said they invite the
devil into our bodies.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.420
But as the girls got older

27:32.421 --> 27:36.384
and began their
female mood swings...

27:36.385 --> 27:40.689
I gave them what
my mama gave me.

27:40.690 --> 27:42.861
St.-John's-wort. It's
an herbal remedy.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.764
I thought it was harmless.

27:45.765 --> 27:48.366
I made them promise
never to tell Caleb...

27:48.367 --> 27:51.300
(Crying) But he was right.

27:58.407 --> 27:59.978
(Door opens)

27:59.979 --> 28:01.079
(Door closes)

28:01.080 --> 28:02.210
St.-John's-wort

28:02.211 --> 28:05.013
is a powerful inducer
of a cytochrome enzyme

28:05.014 --> 28:06.755
that can speed
up the elimination

28:06.756 --> 28:07.956
of certain drugs from the body.

28:07.957 --> 28:09.417
Could explain why
there were no drugs

28:09.418 --> 28:10.819
in Rebecca or Chelsea's systems.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.761
Exactly. By the time
we tested their blood,

28:12.762 --> 28:14.162
their drug levels
had probably dropped

28:14.163 --> 28:16.694
to a point that was
undetectable by the tox screen.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.867
We may find out what
made these girls sick.

28:18.868 --> 28:20.698
I'll rerun the blood, keeping
the cytochrome enzyme

28:20.699 --> 28:22.170
into account.
Better make it quick,

28:22.171 --> 28:24.433
'cause I gotta cut these
two loose pretty soon.

28:29.178 --> 28:31.079
Well, I know you
have a full caseload,

28:31.080 --> 28:34.012
but we need to the new
tox results in hours, not days.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.744
We're trying to save
a young girl's life here.

28:35.745 --> 28:37.946
We don't have
the luxury of time.

28:37.947 --> 28:40.919
It's not a request.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.792
Yeah. Glad you understand.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.193
So how long till we know?

28:45.194 --> 28:47.226
Three hours, tops.

28:48.798 --> 28:50.298
So what was that stuff

28:50.299 --> 28:53.202
Chelsea was saying to
you during the exorcism?

28:54.503 --> 28:56.034
Oh, I don't know.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.306
Nothing.

29:01.871 --> 29:05.374
Didn't seem like nothing to me.

29:09.879 --> 29:11.419
(Sighs)

29:11.420 --> 29:13.421
When I was 8,

29:13.422 --> 29:16.985
I was very forgetful. I
was always in my head.

29:16.986 --> 29:19.427
And I kept leaving
my jacket at school.

29:19.428 --> 29:21.089
I had this long walk home,

29:21.090 --> 29:23.792
and by the time I got
there, I was freezing.

29:23.793 --> 29:25.463
My mother... she just didn't
know what to do with me.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.065
She kept saying, uh,

29:27.066 --> 29:29.167
"you always have to
make everything so difficult,

29:29.168 --> 29:30.368
do it the hard way."

29:30.369 --> 29:31.940
She got that right.

29:31.941 --> 29:34.243
(Huffs) Thanks.

29:36.475 --> 29:40.108
And then...

29:40.109 --> 29:42.911
One morning, we're at breakfast,

29:42.912 --> 29:47.015
and my father, he looks at me,

29:47.016 --> 29:50.788
and says...

29:50.789 --> 29:53.922
"Pumpkin," 'cause I...

29:53.923 --> 29:57.926
Had this little round face...

29:57.927 --> 30:00.798
"I will give you a quarter

30:00.799 --> 30:03.801
"for every day that you remember
to bring home your jacket.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.474
Now go learn something."

30:06.475 --> 30:08.507
(Laughs)

30:12.882 --> 30:15.885
How could Chelsea
have possibly known that?

30:19.488 --> 30:26.195
I don't know.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.857
Rebecca and
Chelsea's tox screens

30:28.858 --> 30:30.258
are positive for phencyclidine.

30:30.259 --> 30:31.359
P.c.p.?

30:31.360 --> 30:33.601
Yes, but not your
garden-variety p.C.P.

30:33.602 --> 30:35.133
You'd buy on the street.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.205
This is an
experimental liquid form

30:37.206 --> 30:38.967
undergoing trials in China.

30:38.968 --> 30:40.608
I've heard of this stuff. It's
been popping up in the streets

30:40.609 --> 30:42.470
stateside the past few months.

30:42.471 --> 30:44.012
P.c.p. Perfectly explains

30:44.013 --> 30:46.344
Chelsea's so-called
"demonic" behavior...

30:46.345 --> 30:50.018
Hallucinations, paranoia,
suicidal impulses, aggression.

30:50.019 --> 30:52.150
They weren't possessed.
They were high.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.481
Looks like the
devil gets a pass.

30:53.482 --> 30:55.153
Dr. Hunt was right all along.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.484
I like hearing that.

30:56.485 --> 30:58.186
Well, I don't like saying it.

30:58.187 --> 30:59.357
Curtis, call the hospital.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.889
Let 'em know that
Chelsea's suffering

31:00.890 --> 31:02.060
from phencyclidine ingestion.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.261
It already killed Rebecca.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.333
Let's hope we can spare
Chelsea the same fate.

31:05.334 --> 31:06.634
Got it.

31:06.635 --> 31:08.296
(People speaking indistinctly)

31:08.297 --> 31:09.968
Here's what's bugging me.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.600
P.c.p. Does not explain
the skin infections

31:12.601 --> 31:14.372
or the conjunctivitis.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.105
What about
Stevens-Johnson syndrome?

31:17.106 --> 31:18.276
Right.

31:18.277 --> 31:21.349
S.j.s. S.J.S... An
allergic skin disorder

31:21.350 --> 31:23.211
caused by a drug
or drug combination

31:23.212 --> 31:26.484
that most people don't react to.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.286
Why didn't I think of that?

31:28.287 --> 31:30.258
We know that Rebecca and
Chelsea were taking St.-John's-wort.

31:30.259 --> 31:32.190
Maybe in combination
with the p.C.P.,

31:32.191 --> 31:34.122
it caused an acute reaction.

31:34.123 --> 31:36.224
They were sisters. They would
have the same genetic tendency.

31:36.225 --> 31:37.425
Yeah. And dermal infection

31:37.426 --> 31:39.227
and conjunctivitis
are both symptoms,

31:39.228 --> 31:41.299
which is why they
looked possessed.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.401
I will check it out.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.672
Nicely done.

31:44.673 --> 31:46.034
Surprised?

31:46.035 --> 31:48.336
No. Pleased.

31:48.337 --> 31:51.309
Why didn't the girls just
say they were on p.C.P.?

31:51.310 --> 31:52.680
I don't think they knew.

31:52.681 --> 31:54.242
I think the genuinely believed
the devil was inside them.

31:54.243 --> 31:55.613
Then they were poisoned.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.585
Which brings us back to
Caleb. (Ethan) Maybe not.

31:57.586 --> 31:59.047
I've been going through

31:59.048 --> 32:00.288
the letters I found
at the banks' house.

32:00.289 --> 32:03.321
This one's addressed
to Dr. Jeffrey Dante.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.253
It's, uh, unmailed, unsigned,

32:05.254 --> 32:08.026
and very, very explicit.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.297
You're blushing.

32:09.298 --> 32:10.358
How explicit?

32:10.359 --> 32:13.161
Okay. Pg-13 version?

32:13.162 --> 32:14.562
Dante was playing doctor

32:14.563 --> 32:18.936
with one of Caleb's
underage daughters.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.270
Game changer.

32:25.714 --> 32:28.947
(Indistinct conversations)

32:34.383 --> 32:38.326
Young lady, could you
step outside, please?

32:38.327 --> 32:39.657
(Woman speaks
indistinctly, man coughs)

32:39.658 --> 32:41.329
What's this?

32:41.330 --> 32:42.390
You're under arrest.

32:42.391 --> 32:43.561
For what?

32:43.562 --> 32:46.134
Statutory rape.
(Handcuffs click)

32:46.135 --> 32:47.465
Yeah, I wouldn't
say anything either.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.198
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say

32:50.199 --> 32:52.000
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

32:52.001 --> 32:53.471
Dr. Dante, why do you have

32:53.472 --> 32:56.174
an experimental
form of phencyclidine?

32:56.175 --> 32:57.345
For research.

32:57.346 --> 33:00.008
On what, how to catch jailbait?

33:00.009 --> 33:01.349
Come on.

33:01.350 --> 33:04.182
You can kiss that
medical license good-bye.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.984
Rebecca and Chelsea banks
both got sick off of p.C.P.

33:06.985 --> 33:07.985
That Rebecca got from you.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.318
No. You're wrong.

33:10.319 --> 33:11.519
Rebecca was a drug
addict. You like 'em young.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.321
I think you worked it
out so you both scored.

33:13.322 --> 33:16.264
All right, first of all, I don't
need to hook up with jailbait.

33:16.265 --> 33:18.396
All right, I do just
fine. And second,

33:18.397 --> 33:19.627
the first time that I
met Rebecca was

33:19.628 --> 33:21.329
when I was trying
to save her life.

33:21.330 --> 33:24.573
I think we both know
that that's not exactly true.

33:26.675 --> 33:28.236
What do you mean?

33:28.237 --> 33:29.307
Well, from what
I've been reading,

33:29.308 --> 33:31.209
you knew Rebecca really well,

33:31.210 --> 33:33.610
and it sounds like she wanted
to get to know you even better.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.456
I think I need a lawyer.

33:48.457 --> 33:49.757
Yeah, while you
think about that,

33:49.758 --> 33:52.200
let me just lay a few
things out for you.

33:52.201 --> 33:54.362
You're probably gonna beat
the statutory rape charge.

33:54.363 --> 33:56.334
The victim's dead.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.805
But we're gonna charge
you with killing her...

33:57.806 --> 33:59.637
Involuntary manslaughter...

33:59.638 --> 34:01.739
Unless we clear
this up right now.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.543
I think you need to stop wasting
my time and do the right thing.

34:07.346 --> 34:08.776
(Sighs)

34:08.777 --> 34:11.079
Rebecca didn't write the letter.

34:11.080 --> 34:14.352
Who did?

34:14.353 --> 34:15.554
Hannah.

34:17.686 --> 34:19.687
You're sleeping with Hannah?

34:19.688 --> 34:21.559
Yeah, she showed up at
the clinic a few weeks ago

34:21.560 --> 34:23.831
with a bladder infection.

34:23.832 --> 34:25.363
All right, she flirted
a little bit, no big deal,

34:25.364 --> 34:26.694
but then,

34:26.695 --> 34:30.298
when I closed up, she
was waiting outside.

34:30.299 --> 34:31.799
(Door opens)

34:31.800 --> 34:34.242
I should've said no, but...

34:34.243 --> 34:35.503
(door closes)

34:35.504 --> 34:38.776
You and Hannah
had sex at the clinic?

34:38.777 --> 34:40.308
Yeah.

34:40.309 --> 34:41.779
Oh. Very classy.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.581
She have access to the p.C.P.?

34:43.582 --> 34:44.813
I guess.

34:46.285 --> 34:48.256
But why would she steal it?

34:48.257 --> 34:50.688
I mean, I know what a tweaker
looks like. She was no tweaker.

34:50.689 --> 34:53.221
It wasn't for Hannah. She
was poisoning her sisters,

34:53.222 --> 34:54.862
and they didn't know what
was happening to them.

34:54.863 --> 34:57.325
Where's your
little girlfriend now?

34:57.326 --> 34:58.596
(Tires squeal)

34:58.597 --> 35:00.569
(Turns engine off)

35:09.878 --> 35:12.340
Oh, god! Whoa.
Whoa. What's going on?

35:12.341 --> 35:14.142
You have to help Caleb!
Hannah's gonna kill him!

35:14.143 --> 35:15.343
Where? In the basement.

35:15.344 --> 35:17.716
The door's around
back. She has his gun!

35:19.888 --> 35:22.321
(Whispers) Just stop.

35:25.854 --> 35:29.297
Hannah, put the gun down.

35:29.298 --> 35:31.729
Take another step, and
I'll blow his brains out.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.562
Put the gun down, Hannah.

35:34.563 --> 35:41.470
It's my turn to play god.

35:42.471 --> 35:43.911
(Tommy) Hannah,
lower the weapon.

35:43.912 --> 35:45.773
I can't do that.

35:45.774 --> 35:47.515
Daddy has to pay.

35:47.516 --> 35:49.517
Put the gun down.
We can talk about it.

35:49.518 --> 35:51.819
Hannah, think of your soul.

35:51.820 --> 35:55.523
You pull that trigger, and
god won't be able to help you.

35:55.524 --> 35:58.926
You'll condemn your
soul to eternal damnation.

35:58.927 --> 36:00.528
I already have.

36:00.529 --> 36:02.790
Hannah, I know
why you're doing this.

36:02.791 --> 36:04.862
You know nothing.
Megan, stay back.

36:04.863 --> 36:07.935
You're angry with him,
about your sisters, right?

36:07.936 --> 36:09.697
I tried to help them.

36:09.698 --> 36:12.740
I sacrificed everything
to save their souls.

36:12.741 --> 36:16.504
No, they did nothing
but disappoint you.

36:16.505 --> 36:19.847
Chelsea is weak.

36:19.848 --> 36:23.411
And Rebecca was a drug addict.

36:23.412 --> 36:26.854
You worried about them so much.

36:26.855 --> 36:29.417
It wasn't fair.

36:29.418 --> 36:31.719
They were sinners.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.191
They didn't love you like I do.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.794
I love all my girls equally.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.967
But I'm the one
that deserved it.

36:39.968 --> 36:42.800
I'd do anything for you.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.872
(Megan) Hannah.

36:44.873 --> 36:47.435
You were the good
girl, weren't you?

36:47.436 --> 36:50.278
Yeah, I was, too.

36:50.279 --> 36:51.909
You did everything right.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.581
Nobody noticed.

36:53.582 --> 36:56.645
Is that why you made
your sisters sick?

36:58.617 --> 36:59.917
I...

36:59.918 --> 37:02.890
I-I-I put p.C.P. In their food

37:02.891 --> 37:05.523
so that daddy would
think they were using drugs

37:05.524 --> 37:07.455
and kick them out of the house.

37:07.456 --> 37:09.597
Oh, my god, Hannah, no.

37:09.598 --> 37:10.998
No.

37:10.999 --> 37:12.800
Daddy thought it was the devil.

37:12.801 --> 37:17.435
All part of the great sin that
was hanging over our family.

37:17.436 --> 37:18.936
And once again,

37:18.937 --> 37:23.571
Rebecca and Chelsea
got all the attention,

37:23.572 --> 37:25.443
and I was forgotten.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.745
God save your soul.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.617
I don't know how.

37:29.618 --> 37:32.380
I love you, daddy.

37:32.381 --> 37:36.884
Everything I did, I did
so we could be together.

37:36.885 --> 37:38.726
Hannah, once
you pull that trigger,

37:38.727 --> 37:40.288
you cannot go back.

37:40.289 --> 37:43.631
He's not worth it,
Hannah. He isn't.

37:43.632 --> 37:46.294
(Cocks gun) Hannah,
please put it down. Please.

37:46.295 --> 37:48.666
The lord is my
Shepherd, I shall not...

37:48.667 --> 37:50.368
I'm so sorry.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.539
No! Hannah, no!

37:51.540 --> 37:52.700
(Clicks)

37:52.701 --> 37:55.744
(Sobbing)

38:00.749 --> 38:03.351

38:03.352 --> 38:07.356

38:08.717 --> 38:10.318

38:13.992 --> 38:18.526
(Indistinct conversations)

38:18.527 --> 38:20.498
Figure it out?

38:20.499 --> 38:22.470
You know, it's interesting.

38:22.471 --> 38:25.032
Guns misfire all the time.

38:25.033 --> 38:27.805
But revolvers? Almost never.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.778
Maybe it's divine intervention.

38:30.779 --> 38:33.641
Guess you'd have
to take that on faith.

38:33.642 --> 38:35.913
I do have faith, you know.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.645
Oh, really? In what?

38:37.646 --> 38:39.517
You. You do?

38:39.518 --> 38:41.018
Yeah.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.791
I have faith that
no matter what,

38:43.792 --> 38:46.754
you'll always be annoying.

She's taking a break.

She told me what you did.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.579
It was touch and go there.

40:11.580 --> 40:14.682
I never lost faith.

40:14.683 --> 40:17.645
I admire that.

40:17.646 --> 40:20.988
I know your home
life hasn't been easy.

40:20.989 --> 40:24.452
My father's not a bad man.

40:24.453 --> 40:25.693
He was just raised by parents

40:25.694 --> 40:28.526
who taught him
to fear everything,

40:28.527 --> 40:30.828
especially god.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.461
Daddy just wanted to protect us,

40:33.462 --> 40:36.735
so he did the same
thing, out of love.

40:38.166 --> 40:42.870
But I don't think god
wants us to live in fear.

40:42.871 --> 40:44.543
Not my god.

40:46.174 --> 40:49.477
You're gonna be just fine.

40:49.478 --> 40:52.521
I'm glad that we
had a chance to talk.

40:53.922 --> 40:55.653
Is something wrong?

40:55.654 --> 41:00.628
Uh, no. I-I... had a question.

41:00.629 --> 41:02.560
Okay.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.091
(Man speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

41:04.092 --> 41:07.595
When I stopped the exorcism,

41:07.596 --> 41:09.837
you said something.

41:09.838 --> 41:14.472
You said, "a quarter for
your jacket, pumpkin."

41:15.243 --> 41:17.245
Why'd you say that?

41:18.847 --> 41:21.008
I don't remember saying it.

41:21.009 --> 41:22.510
(Chuckles)

41:22.511 --> 41:25.052
I don't really
remember anything.

41:25.053 --> 41:26.183
I'm sorry.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.555
No. No. It's fine. It's fine.

41:27.556 --> 41:30.187
Just get some rest.

41:30.188 --> 41:32.721
Now go learn something.
