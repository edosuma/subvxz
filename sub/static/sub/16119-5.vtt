00:06.340 --> 00:07.208
Ah.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.647
Hey, are you playing

00:13.681 --> 00:15.716
Uh, no, just him.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.518
It's Paper Boi.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.520
Oh, okay.
Well...

00:19.553 --> 00:21.589
I think Lowrider magazine
wanted to talk to him.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.224
Let me see if I can find
someone, one minute.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.525
Cool.

00:24.558 --> 00:28.096
Ah.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.397
Yo, it's time

00:29.430 --> 00:31.399

00:31.432 --> 00:32.866
I'm thinking, what?

00:32.900 --> 00:35.336
MVP Honors.
Oh.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.238
Yeah, you were pretty good
back in the day.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.506

Back in the day?

00:38.539 --> 00:39.940

00:44.978 --> 00:46.280
What ever happened to the old,

00:46.314 --> 00:47.848
uh, running shoe place?

00:47.881 --> 00:50.284
Oh, man, that place
was dope, wasn't it?

00:50.318 --> 00:51.852
-Yeah.
-They shot it up though.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.521
Dang.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.456
I mean, niggas started trying
to call charging, man.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.057
It was all bad.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.100
Yeah.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.769
(basketball bouncing)

01:12.106 --> 01:13.707
You should go ahead
and interview me now

01:13.741 --> 01:17.145
'cause I'ma be MVP
of this thing.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.247
I'm sorry, what?

01:19.280 --> 01:22.150

01:26.187 --> 01:27.821
Hey, you Valencia Joyner, right?

01:27.855 --> 01:29.390
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.493
Yeah, I see you do them
interviews on TV all the time.

Thank you.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.900
So what's good?
You...wanna interview me?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.402
You know, I'll tell you
my whole life story.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.570
Are you playing
in the game later?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.605
Yup.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.973
All right, you got me.
I'm a rapper.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.308
(chuckles)

01:47.341 --> 01:48.909
You may have heard of me.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.644
Paper Boi.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.346
I do that song.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.615
-* Paper Boi, Pap--
-Oh, I know who you are.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.184
You're the guy
who shot someone.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.418
See what--
see, well,

01:57.451 --> 01:58.786
it ain't really
happen like that.

01:58.819 --> 01:59.920
You know what I'm saying?
The Internet,

01:59.953 --> 02:02.956
they just run with stories, so.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.858
So you need to
get to know the real me.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.628
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.998
Look, I'll even let you
interview me

02:11.031 --> 02:13.000

02:13.033 --> 02:14.168
Mm-hmm.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.170
Yeah, that sound good, right?

02:16.204 --> 02:17.838
I don't know.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.007
My audience isn't into
the whole gangster thing.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.709
I'm not really either.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.111
(blows raspberry)
Gangster? I see.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.013
No, baby, you got me
all wrong, man.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.716
Look, I'm a gentleman first.
(chuckles)

02:28.749 --> 02:29.850
That's why you need to
get to know...

02:29.883 --> 02:31.352
-Hey, Val, I need to--
-Me.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.287
I need to prep you
for the half-time segment.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.823
-Rosalyn has a few questions.
-Okay.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.694
-Well, you have fun at the game.
-Well, hold up, wait.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.396
See--

02:42.430 --> 02:45.199
Damon Wayans-looking nigga.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.700

02:46.734 --> 02:49.703
(funk music)

02:49.737 --> 02:56.577
*

03:03.917 --> 03:05.253
Who's that?

03:05.286 --> 03:07.421
Val Joyner.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.922
You know her?

03:08.956 --> 03:10.023
Oh, yeah.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.325
Yeah, she cute.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.227

03:13.261 --> 03:14.728
-Justin Bieber!

03:20.133 --> 03:21.402
-Yeah, boy!
-Hey, Justin, right here.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.404
Hey, Justin, right here!

03:23.437 --> 03:26.374
-Hey!
-Justin!

03:26.407 --> 03:28.108
I'm surprised
he even showed up, man.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.911
What is the deal
with this nigga, man?

03:30.944 --> 03:32.380
What do you mean?

03:32.413 --> 03:36.216
Like, why everybody
always going crazy over him?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.951
He can sing.
He can dance.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.953
Girls think he's cute.
I don't know.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.154
Man, that shit weird to me.

03:43.457 --> 03:46.260
Hey, you that nigga that blew
that other nigga's brains out.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.861
Cool.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.399
Justin!
Over here!

03:55.135 --> 03:57.070
It's cool.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.607
VALENCIA: So hey, Justin,
how are you?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.108
It's good to see you.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.943
You look like you're ready
for the game.

04:02.976 --> 04:06.079
And I--
(laughs)

04:09.082 --> 04:10.951
I'm gonna dunk on a bitch!

04:12.986 --> 04:14.922
ALFRED: I don't like this nigga.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.557
I don't know,
he's kind of funny.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.727
I mean, he's hot right now.
You should work with him.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.228
I mean, speaking as
your manager, you know.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.663
Just 'cause you dressed
like a 6th grader

04:22.696 --> 04:24.432
don't make you my manager, man.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.800
Hey, we're starting soon,
so you should get dressed.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.569
-Cool.
-Locker room is this way.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.137
Thank you.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.805
-Hey, where you gonna be at?
-I don't know.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.240
I'm probably gonna try and find

04:33.273 --> 04:35.142
some corner to hang out in,
you know.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.276
After the game,
I'll just find you.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.878
All right.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.815

04:44.718 --> 04:48.021
Hey, Alonzo.
Alonzo.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.190
Alonzo, behind you.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.159
Why, you little sneak,
you can't say hello?

04:52.192 --> 04:54.027
(kisses and laughs)

04:54.061 --> 04:56.196
Oh, I...

04:56.229 --> 04:58.999
I don't--I don't think you...
mean to...

04:59.032 --> 05:01.201
Oh, yeah, you're surprised
to see me, I'm sure.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.203
Yeah, well, I'm back
from the dead again.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.938
You know, I've been doing that
my whole career, so.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.675
Was that your client
back there?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.877
Uh, yeah.
That's--that's Paper Boi.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.545
Oh, right.

05:11.579 --> 05:12.980
I've heard of that.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.617
So, uh, are you still
at CSA or did you go...

05:16.650 --> 05:19.152
(coughs)
independent now?

05:19.186 --> 05:21.221
I...
I'm independent.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.823
(mumbles)
I think, um...

05:22.856 --> 05:23.957
MAN: I'm sorry, ma'am.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.225
I'm sorry, ma'am, you--

05:25.258 --> 05:26.660
you can't smoke that in here.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.396
(sighs)
Okay.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.531
So, uh, you're
coming upstairs, right?

05:30.564 --> 05:32.833
I mean, all the other agents
and such are there.

05:32.866 --> 05:33.734
So come on.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.872
And I am gonna smoke up there,

05:38.906 --> 05:40.808

what that guy says about it.

05:40.841 --> 05:41.909
EARN: Yeah.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.315
JANICE: These days,
it is all about management.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.217
I mean, the money is drying up

05:50.250 --> 05:52.085
in all the old markets.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.187
I mean, it's important to keep
what you have, is what I think.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.823
I mean, you know
Alan Greengate, right?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.558
He's the--he's the guy
who represents all those

05:57.591 --> 05:59.493
athletes who want
to become actors.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.429
I mean, he should be in here.
He'll tell you that I'm right.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.063
Seriously.
He knows.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.565
Whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.166
You need a pass
to get in here.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.568

I thought--

06:07.601 --> 06:09.169
You playing
in the game or something?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.604
You really don't think
that we're gonna wear

06:10.638 --> 06:12.673
those ugly VIP laminates
that you guys sent out

06:12.706 --> 06:14.207
on our chest, right?

06:14.241 --> 06:15.543
Just let him through.
I mean, we--

06:15.576 --> 06:18.278
we all don't want
to be at this thing.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.379
Come on.

Well, it's got a
little more kick than the 9.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.397

07:10.430 --> 07:11.732
This your first time shooting?

07:11.765 --> 07:13.834
No.
No, it'll be fine.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.002
I'll take that one.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.269
All right.

Man, I see him on TV

10:37.705 --> 10:38.672
How bout that?

10:38.706 --> 10:39.940
(whistle blows)

10:39.973 --> 10:42.009
Let's go.
What you got?

10:42.042 --> 10:43.443
What you got?

10:43.476 --> 10:44.845
-What you got?
-Ball.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.546
Ball.
Nigga, give me the ball.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.215
Nigger!
Thanks!

10:48.248 --> 10:50.117
What you got?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.318
Bout to whoop
your pomegranate ass.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.485
This ain't Space Jam, nigga.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.486
Play ball, let's go--

10:53.520 --> 10:54.421
Shit.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.391
(cheers)

10:58.425 --> 11:00.327
Damn.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.863
You broke in real life
and basketball.

11:02.896 --> 11:03.864
(scoffs)

11:11.271 --> 11:13.673
(guns firing)

11:13.707 --> 11:15.175
(chuckles)

11:15.208 --> 11:17.510
Yeah.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.346
All right.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.149
What do you think
you're doing?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.117
(shouting)
What do you think you're doing?

11:25.919 --> 11:28.388
Who? Me?
Shooting.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.158
You can't shoot dogs.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.660
What are you, a psycho?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.228
Why not?

11:35.262 --> 11:37.564
Listen, man, look,
the dogs from my neighborhood,

11:37.597 --> 11:38.732
they're crazy.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.200
They bite babies and--and--

11:40.233 --> 11:42.002
I don't give a damn.
My kid could be in here.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.737
You--you can't shoot a dog.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.776
Well, why would I shoot
at a human target?

11:48.809 --> 11:51.078
I mean, that's weird, right?
I mean, look at that one.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.880
That's just
way too specific, man.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.514
I don't care.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.416
I--I'm not gonna let you
shoot a fucking dog in here.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.451
-Hey.
-But--

11:58.485 --> 12:00.220
He can shoot
whatever he wants.

12:00.253 --> 12:04.057
You shoot at your racist targets
with no problem.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.860
I saw you shoot at that one
with a Mexican holding a knife.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.728
It's shameful.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.931
America has taken so much.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.766
No more.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.903
A revolution
will rise from within.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.905
Blood will spill.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.373
(mumbles)
Well, I didn't say all that,

12:20.407 --> 12:21.608
but, you know...

12:21.641 --> 12:23.543
You ain't gonna shoot
no dog target.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.312
MAN: You!
Let's go.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey--hey, uh--

12:27.314 --> 12:28.648
what--what did I do, man?

12:28.681 --> 12:30.383
I told you the rules
before you came in here.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.920
I ain't gonna let you
start no shit.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.823
(country music over radio)

12:37.524 --> 12:39.359
Oh.
Uh, you still have my ID.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.001
Can I get the dog poster?

12:48.035 --> 12:50.938
-Get the hell out.
-Okay.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.605
(store entrance bell jingles)

12:52.639 --> 12:53.640
(scoffs)

12:55.843 --> 12:58.511
Yeah, definitely, I mean,
with the way things are going

12:58.545 --> 12:59.847
nowadays, I mean,
you got to be careful about

12:59.880 --> 13:01.348
-the deals you sign.
-Mm-hmm.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.649
See, I tell my clients that
all the time.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.784
Brand association
is important.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.086
EARN: Yeah.
-Yeah, working in music,

13:06.119 --> 13:07.487
you definitely got to
do it different.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.522
I think that's why
John went to TV.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.590
(polite laughter)

13:10.623 --> 13:11.959
So hey, is--is your client

13:11.992 --> 13:13.326
working with anyone
on the TV side?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.494
'Cause I got
a few people looking

13:14.527 --> 13:16.296
for that sort of thing,
ad-wise.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.265
Um, my client's
interested in

13:18.298 --> 13:20.133
anything that...
pays money.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.668
-(laughter)
-Right.

13:21.701 --> 13:22.769
Makes sense.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.770
So who you with, ASA?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.305
I'm independent.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.974
Okay, well, take my card

13:27.007 --> 13:28.876
and we should get together
'cause I have a lot

13:28.909 --> 13:30.777
going on next year
and I want to make sure

13:30.810 --> 13:32.045
I got good people on board.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.313
Here, take mine as well.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.814
Great.
Uh...

13:34.848 --> 13:37.050
I--I ran out of cards here
so, like,

13:37.084 --> 13:38.685
I'll just make sure to call both
of you guys.

13:38.718 --> 13:39.887
-Okay.
-Yeah, that's great.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.288
And--what's your name, again?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.689
Just call me Earn, yeah.

13:42.722 --> 13:43.991
-Earn, okay.
-Earn.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.692
-Well, great to meet you, Earn.
-Yeah.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.060
-Be in touch.
-It was great meeting you.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.461
Yeah, it was really nice
meeting you guys.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.397
Talk to you soon.
Same here, bye.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.800
(lounge piano music playing)

13:53.833 --> 13:55.568
(taps cards)

13:55.602 --> 14:00.540
*

14:00.573 --> 14:02.009
How much for a beer?

14:02.042 --> 14:04.044
Oh, it's, uh, gratis.

14:04.077 --> 14:07.380
Oh, uh, then I'll have
a Hennessy and Grand Marnier.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.415
Yeah.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.351
(indistinct chatter)

14:28.101 --> 14:29.369
Here you go.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.941
Hey, Janice.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.042
Mm...

14:35.075 --> 14:36.743
whiskey, straight up?

14:36.776 --> 14:39.112
Uh, Bushmills,
not the cheap stuff.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.847
I'm worth it.
(laughs)

14:40.880 --> 14:41.748
(laughs)
(lighter flicks)

14:43.616 --> 14:45.185
So...

14:45.218 --> 14:47.854
you having fun yet?
(lighter snaps shut)

14:47.887 --> 14:49.556
Yeah.
It's great up here.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.760
I'm sure it is.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.762
(clears throat)
Remember at the Grammys,

14:55.795 --> 14:57.931
it was six years ago,

14:57.965 --> 15:00.067
isn't that where
we first met?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.568
Yeah, I think so.

15:01.601 --> 15:02.936
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.105
Yeah, you were just
a rookie in this thing.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.440
Remember?
(laughs)

15:07.474 --> 15:09.409
-Look at you now.
-(laughs)

15:09.442 --> 15:11.244
I'm just happy
to be here, you know.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.116
I--I remember I--I--
I told you that

15:16.149 --> 15:18.551
loyalty was
really important, that, uh...

15:18.585 --> 15:20.420
(clears throat)
the good ones are loyal

15:20.453 --> 15:22.755
to their clients,
the great ones, though,

15:22.789 --> 15:24.191
are loyal to their peers.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.660
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.731
(sighs)

15:31.764 --> 15:33.433
(scoffs)

15:33.466 --> 15:36.169
You know I don't work
for ASA anymore?

15:36.203 --> 15:37.904
I didn't--
nah, I didn't know that.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.440
Yeah, it's been really hard
for me in this business.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.309
You know, coming in
as a woman, but...

15:42.342 --> 15:44.911
(clears throat)
the last three years

15:44.944 --> 15:47.414
have been even worse.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.449
Sorry to hear that.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.284
Yeah.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.687
(scoffs)

15:54.721 --> 15:56.256
Look,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.658
I know it was you, Alonzo.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.627
-What?
-(exhales)

16:00.660 --> 16:02.762
I know you sold me out,

16:02.795 --> 16:04.264
you faggot cocksucker!

16:04.297 --> 16:05.532
-Whoa--
-What did you think I

16:05.565 --> 16:07.034
wouldn't know it was you?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.269
You've been avoiding me
the last three years!

16:09.302 --> 16:10.770
You piece of shit.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.539
You undercut me.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.341
I had to hear from Gail--
fucking Gail--

16:14.374 --> 16:15.708
that you were speaking
to my clients.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.177
I know--I--
I'm sorry.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.211
(laughs)
What is happening?

16:18.245 --> 16:19.779
You screwed me over

16:19.812 --> 16:21.281
and you thought I wasn't
gonna know it was you,

16:21.314 --> 16:22.482
but I know!
I know, Alonzo.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.683
Okay?
I know.

16:23.716 --> 16:24.984
-No, no--
-Yeah, no-no.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.453
It's all right.
It's all right.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.288
It's okay. You thought
I was finished, but...

16:28.321 --> 16:31.324
(clears throat)
I'm a survivor.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.226
(laughs)
No, there must be--

16:33.260 --> 16:34.794
-there's a mistake happening...
-Mm. Mm-mm.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.296
Right now, there's
some sort of mistake.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.032
Mm-mm--wipe that sharecropper
smile off your face.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.533
You know what?

16:40.567 --> 16:43.470
I am going to ruin you.
I'm gonna ruin you.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.206
No matter where you go,
I'm gonna follow you.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.975
I'm gonna be on you
and I am going to take back

16:49.008 --> 16:51.010
everything--everything

16:51.044 --> 16:53.180
that you--you stole from me.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.383
(smooches)

16:58.085 --> 16:59.952
I'm not Alonzo.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.927
I'm gonna make sure

17:07.960 --> 17:10.063
that you die homeless.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.106
(indistinct cheering)

17:19.139 --> 17:20.907
What you got, little nigga?

17:20.940 --> 17:22.409
I'm still MVP, nigga.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.544
I'm coming for that shit.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.546
Alfred, I'm open on the block!
I'm open!

17:26.579 --> 17:28.448
WOMAN: I love you, Justin!
-I know, bitch!

17:28.481 --> 17:30.083
Alfred! Alfred!
Alfred!

17:30.117 --> 17:32.385
(crowd reacts)

17:32.419 --> 17:34.554
Hell no, nigga.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.289
No!
(whistle blows)

17:36.323 --> 17:37.424
(crowd groans)

17:37.457 --> 17:40.327
(crowd shouting indistinctly)

17:42.795 --> 17:43.930
-Bitch.
-Nigga!

17:43.963 --> 17:45.064
(buzzer rings)

17:46.766 --> 17:48.135
(crowd groans)

17:48.168 --> 17:49.469
-Oh, you pushing now?
-Come on.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.770
You push me while my back
is turned?

17:50.803 --> 17:51.938
How bout I push you
that way, huh?

17:51.971 --> 17:53.740
You put your hands on me,
nigga?

17:53.773 --> 17:54.774
(both grumbling)

17:54.807 --> 17:56.743
(crowd murmuring)

17:56.776 --> 17:59.078
Don't nobody even like
your stupid-ass music.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.249
Get your hand off my face.
Get your hand off my face.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.985
(both groaning and straining)

18:06.018 --> 18:07.053
You know what?
I'm gonna kill you, nigga.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.621
I'm gonna kill you.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.089
-I'm gonna kill you.
-Gonna kill you first.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.459
Look, I'm drunk,
but this is ridiculous.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.827
-You dumb--nasty!
-Give me that fucking shit!

18:14.861 --> 18:16.963
(crowd jeering)

18:16.996 --> 18:18.398
-I hate you, I hate you, I...
-I'm MVP, I'm MVP, I'm MVP...

18:18.431 --> 18:19.932
-I hate you, nigga!
-I'm MVP!

18:23.102 --> 18:27.740
(indistinct chatter)

18:27.774 --> 18:29.776
(cameras snapping)

18:32.279 --> 18:33.313
Hey, everybody.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.115
I just want to say, um,

18:36.149 --> 18:38.585
sorry about
what happened today.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.687
It's not who I am.

18:40.720 --> 18:45.258
I--I guess I been trying
to be so...cool lately

18:45.292 --> 18:50.029
that I became something I'm not.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.464
(crowd gasps)

18:51.498 --> 18:54.201
Wait.
It's cool, it's cool.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.935
This is me.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.671
This is the real Justin.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.207
I'm not a bad guy.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.109
I actually love Christ.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.278
I guess I've just been hanging
out with the wrong people.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.779
(hip-hop music builds)

19:06.813 --> 19:08.381
Which is why I want to sing
this new single

19:08.415 --> 19:10.617
from my upcoming album,
"Justice."

19:10.650 --> 19:13.620
(scattered cheers)

19:13.653 --> 19:17.857
*

19:17.890 --> 19:19.526
(Auto-Tuned)
* Girl

19:19.559 --> 19:20.627
* You know what I did

19:20.660 --> 19:21.861
(women cheer)

19:21.894 --> 19:23.796
* Doesn't matter

19:23.830 --> 19:26.966
* You know that
I'll always be better *

19:26.999 --> 19:28.901
* Sometimes I'm crazy
and I know it *

19:28.935 --> 19:31.504
I can't believe this nigga.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.507
JUSTIN: * That's how I show you
that I care *

19:34.541 --> 19:36.142
* Whatever I did, girl

19:36.175 --> 19:38.144
Hey.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.214
Crazy day, right?
(laughs)

19:43.015 --> 19:44.351
Hey, look, I just want
to apologize

19:44.384 --> 19:48.087
to people, you know,
for how I was acting.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.358
Think they got
the wrong idea of me.

19:51.391 --> 19:55.228
Maybe...
you can interview me sometime?

19:55.262 --> 19:57.430
Get to know the real me.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.065
(inhales)

19:59.098 --> 20:02.402
Listen, I want
to give you some advice.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.003
Play your part.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.773
People don't want Justin
to be the asshole.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.409
They want you
to be the asshole.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.011
You're a rapper.
That's your job.

20:12.044 --> 20:16.416
JUSTIN: * Whatever I did
doesn't matter *

20:16.449 --> 20:19.586
* You know that I'll
always be better *

20:19.619 --> 20:22.422
* Sometimes I'm crazy
and you know it *

20:22.455 --> 20:24.524
*

20:24.557 --> 20:25.892
Hey, man, how the game go?

20:25.925 --> 20:28.060
(scoffs)
Terrible.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.929
You ain't see that?

20:29.962 --> 20:32.432
No, man, see what?

20:32.465 --> 20:34.701
It don't even matter, man.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.904
JUSTIN: * Whatever I do, girl,
just forget about it *

20:37.937 --> 20:39.306
-What is wrong with you?
-Nothing.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.540
Nothing.
Nothing, man.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.909
Um, you want to
get out of here, man?

20:42.942 --> 20:45.244
Yeah.
Yeah, man, let's do that.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.947
* Everybody put your hands up

20:47.980 --> 20:50.216
* Girl

20:50.249 --> 20:53.653
* You know what I did
doesn't matter *

20:53.686 --> 20:57.089
* You know that I'll
always be better *

20:57.123 --> 21:01.294
* Sometimes I'm crazy
and you know it *

21:01.328 --> 21:04.564
* That's how I show you
that I care *

21:04.597 --> 21:08.234
* Whatever I did, girl,
forget about it *

21:08.267 --> 21:12.071
* Whatever I say, girl,
just forget about it *

21:12.104 --> 21:13.906
* Whatever I do, girl

21:13.940 --> 21:18.010
* Just forget about it
all night long *

21:18.044 --> 21:19.479
* Girl

21:19.512 --> 21:22.815
* Whoa
(echoes)

21:22.849 --> 21:26.185
Everybody put your hands up.

21:26.218 --> 21:29.088
Clap 'em together.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.590
Clap 'em together for me.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.124
*

21:32.158 --> 21:35.194
* Ooh, oh, na-na
