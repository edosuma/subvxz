00:12.120 --> 00:13.560
Dad?

00:58.440 --> 01:00.320
Lady Margaret speaking.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.400
Hello?

01:05.400 --> 01:06.480
'He's dead.'

01:08.080 --> 01:09.720
'I said, "He's dead!"'

01:09.720 --> 01:10.760
I'm sorry.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.440
Well, you will be.
You and your snivelling husband.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.640
Daniel Walsh.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.400
Hang up.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.480
You're going to pay
for what you did!

02:23.840 --> 02:25.320
Hm?

02:36.520 --> 02:38.520
Daniel?

02:39.800 --> 02:40.840
What's happened?

02:42.760 --> 02:44.080
I can't afford the rent.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.480
Not without Dad.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.320
Let's have a brew instead, shall we?

03:09.800 --> 03:11.080
'Clarence!'

03:13.120 --> 03:17.560
Patrick. I got your message,
what's the problem?

03:17.560 --> 03:21.560
It's this Daniel Walsh business.
Margaret just won't see sense.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.040
Well, you're the man of the house.
You need to take charge.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.200
I know, but, you know,
I think she might listen

03:26.200 --> 03:27.600
if it came from someone else.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.320
Bit of back-up, eh? Lead the way.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.440
Thanks, Clarence.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.760
Margaret?

03:43.720 --> 03:46.240
I hear this Walsh chap's
been making threats.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.240
It's nothing.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.720
He's just upset.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.840
I still think we should
call the police.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.080
Absolutely not.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.600
I have no intention
of raking up the past...

03:57.600 --> 04:00.000
and I refuse to be intimidated
by someone like him.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.920
But he's dangerous -
we need to do something.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.040
Don't be such a coward, Patrick.
He's a pathetic drunk!

04:06.480 --> 04:08.800
Now go and tell Thomas
to take the car out.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.640
I agree with Patrick.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.959
You're putting yourself at risk...

04:21.600 --> 04:22.840
..playing with fire.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.480
Sorry it's been a while.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.680
You've obviously been busy.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.680
I'll make it up to you.

04:36.680 --> 04:40.360
Perhaps you could come for
another photo session?

04:40.360 --> 04:43.320
Something a little different
this time. Some...

04:44.320 --> 04:46.880
..French lingerie shots, perhaps?

04:48.600 --> 04:51.600
With all those models, I don't know
why you bother with someone like me.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.120
Well, you've got a lot to offer.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.160
Not here.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.360
I have to organise the charity hunt.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.400
Well, if I can't change your mind.
Well...I might call in later.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.480
I have to take your measurements...

05:08.760 --> 05:09.920
..for your costume.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.160
Finally got his wish.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.280
He wanted to die?

05:23.320 --> 05:25.600
He was delirious, Father -

05:25.600 --> 05:27.640
in agony for weeks.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.040
He didn't know what he was saying.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.040
There's no sin in wanting
to end your suffering.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.120
Is that his sabre?

05:41.040 --> 05:42.320
He left it me.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.760
He fought in two wars.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.760
And then to be killed like that.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.880
Why?

06:04.760 --> 06:07.320
Until we know what Walsh is up to,

06:07.320 --> 06:10.840
maybe you should think about
that summer school we talked.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.680
You're just using that as an excuse.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.720
No, of course not!
I just want you to be safe.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.400
Either way, I think it might
be good for you.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.360
I've got more important
things to do. Really?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.880
At your age I was reading
Rousseau and Derrida.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.960
Yes, we all know
what a genius you are(!)

06:30.960 --> 06:32.560
That's not what I'm saying,

06:32.560 --> 06:35.920
but if this is how you spend your
time it's no wonder you end up...

06:37.080 --> 06:40.000
Go on...say it!

06:40.000 --> 06:43.120
Lucia, that's not what I meant.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.120
Look, I wasn't thinking straight.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.240
You were the best sacristan
we ever had.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.680
Even when I drank all the wine?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.120
Yeah, well, we all have
our weakness.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.480
Daniel, promise me you will
not go and see them.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.080
If you make a scene,
they will have you arrested.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.880
I need to know
why she did it, Father.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.840
I owe Dad that much.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.040
You still think
it wasn't an accident?

07:11.680 --> 07:14.120
Her husband said your father
stepped into the road.

07:14.120 --> 07:17.520
Spineless runt lied -
he's as bad as her!

07:17.520 --> 07:19.440
Why would she want to kill him?

07:19.440 --> 07:26.240
I don't know. But Dad was adamant -
she saw him, and ACCELERATED!

07:27.760 --> 07:29.480
Oh!

07:29.480 --> 07:30.880
Well, really.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.600
Father, did you get your tickets
for tomorrow's hunt?

07:36.640 --> 07:39.680
I did but the Bishop's enrolled
me on a course -

07:39.680 --> 07:41.400
The Directa Decretal.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.440
The relevance of clerical celibacy -
riveting stuff.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.840
Never mind.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.840
It's just a pity Inspector Valentine
won't have any real competition.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.960
The Inspector's going?
No-one else will stand a chance.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.680
Oh, well. Must dash.
On second thoughts...

07:59.800 --> 08:01.440
I could give celibacy a miss.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.760
The course!

08:04.760 --> 08:07.120
Naturally. See you tomorrow.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.440
Thomas, love the mask.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.160
Thirsty? Parched.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.240
Sorry, Sid, not when you're driving.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.520
Great!

08:34.520 --> 08:38.919
On behalf of the Kembleford
Ornithological Society,

08:38.919 --> 08:42.520
I'd like to thank you for all
your generous donations.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.520
In a short while, we shall begin
the charity nest hunt.

08:49.520 --> 08:53.560
Each team has to gather as many
coloured feathers as they can find.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.480
For every feather found,
you will receive a clue

08:56.480 --> 08:59.000
to the whereabouts
of the peacock's nest

08:59.000 --> 09:01.120
from one of my feathered helpers.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.240
Professor Egghead
and Captain Birdbrain!

09:04.520 --> 09:06.920
Is he going to be like this all day?

09:06.920 --> 09:09.280
Perhaps you should go
and look after the car, Sid?

09:09.280 --> 09:11.440
Take a mask if you haven't got one.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.600
Will you relax? He's not even here.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.960
Probably lying drunk in some gutter.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.960
Would you look at that? Shameless!

09:49.360 --> 09:51.040
Lucia, what do you think
you're doing?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.880
Parading around like some shop girl!

09:52.880 --> 09:55.680
Scared I'll steal your thunder?

09:55.680 --> 09:58.760
You're supposed to be studying,
you have a class later.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.240
I'm not going.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.600
I don't learn anything,
so what's the point?!

10:02.600 --> 10:03.720
Not again.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.080
Mummy, please. It's too difficult.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.240
Look, you're going, that's final!
Now, go back inside.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.520
Thank you, my son.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.960
Thomas!

10:48.240 --> 10:52.560
Thought any more about
modelling for me, hmm? Let me go.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.840
You might want to reconsider

10:54.840 --> 10:57.120
or I might tell Mummy
about lover-boy.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.360
Hello.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.360
Everything all right?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.640
Fine, thank you, Father.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.720
I just don't like big crowds.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.360
I never realised
you were so talented.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.120
Most people just think
they're weird. Weird...

11:48.240 --> 11:49.400
..and wonderful.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.680
You like jazz? I'm learning to.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.080
I like all music...

11:59.480 --> 12:02.680
..except when it's being murdered
on the church organ.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.400
That's better.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.960
You should be more careful
who you employ.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.880
He was all over her.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.720
I hope you're going to do something.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.920
I saw you.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.760
The way you looked at her -
my own daughter.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.760
You not suggesting...?

12:24.760 --> 12:27.560
She is a child, for pity's sake.

12:27.560 --> 12:30.400
Margaret...
If you EVER go near her...!

12:35.440 --> 12:38.680
Oh, at last!

12:38.680 --> 12:41.240
Some civilised company.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.360
Looks like you've found a friend.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.560
His name is Mr Gillespie -
he's a jazz fan.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.520
That's a silly name for a dog.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.360
Inspector, come to join
the winning team?

12:52.360 --> 12:54.600
As a respected member
of the community,

12:54.600 --> 12:57.800
it's important to show support
for charitable events.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.520
The hunt is secondary.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.360
I agree, it's the fundraising
that counts.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.120
Absolutely.
I probably won't even enter.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.480
Me neither.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.720
Give someone else a chance.
It's the Christian thing to do.

13:10.760 --> 13:11.960
Well...

13:13.160 --> 13:14.200
..anyway.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.440
What?

13:23.640 --> 13:25.280
I can't see in this thing.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.680
Put it back on,
we'll be starting shortly.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.840
Oh, Thomas, a word.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.960
As from today, your services
will no longer be required.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.520
What? No!

13:36.520 --> 13:39.440
See me later, I'll pay you
what you're owed.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.920
Lady Margaret...
Get your hand off me!

13:43.440 --> 13:45.120
I'm sorry...

13:45.120 --> 13:46.760
but I really need this job.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.280
My decision has been made.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.880
Five minutes to start, everyone!

14:09.320 --> 14:10.960
Child's play.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.640
Not another one!

14:16.640 --> 14:19.200
Father, I know you said
this was about fundraising

14:19.200 --> 14:22.000
but I didn't think
you actually meant it.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.560
Just giving the other teams
a sporting chance.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.800
But we haven't got any feathers yet?

14:26.800 --> 14:30.200
Well, maybe if you put down your
wine glass for a minute! Hmm!

14:33.640 --> 14:35.040
Who's a clever boy, then?

14:40.320 --> 14:41.520
Thank you.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.600
Oh!

14:44.600 --> 14:45.640
Oh, sorry.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.200
Father Brown,
you are up to something.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.840
Come on, then, here we go!
And where have you been?

15:06.840 --> 15:08.440
What are you doing, Father?

15:09.640 --> 15:11.280
(Right.)

15:11.280 --> 15:13.560
Here we go!

15:13.560 --> 15:15.280
Ooh! And off we go!

15:46.240 --> 15:48.280
Congratulations!

15:48.280 --> 15:51.240
I was starting to think
no-one would ever find me.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.920
Enjoy!

15:52.920 --> 15:55.440
Oh, Father, you're a genius.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.920
Oh, ye of little faith.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.600
Oh, I never doubted you
for one moment, Father.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.680
Of course, we will share the prize
with the other team.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.560
Patrick?

16:19.280 --> 16:20.800
Patrick, is that you?

16:20.800 --> 16:23.880
What are you doing? You're supposed
to be helping the guests.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.960
Patrick?

16:25.960 --> 16:27.000
Pat..?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.160
The captain!

16:43.600 --> 16:46.880
Don't let anyone leave
the premises - get them all inside.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.640
Poor Clarence.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.760
Why would anyone want to kill him?

16:56.320 --> 16:57.640
Inspector...

16:59.120 --> 17:01.480
I think that I was
the intended victim.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.560
We were wearing the same mask.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.640
Walsh must have thought that
the Captain was me.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.839
Daniel Walsh?

17:07.839 --> 17:10.200
Erm, he threatened us yesterday.

17:11.760 --> 17:15.119
We want a police guard until
that maniac is caught. Professor...

17:15.119 --> 17:19.160
No. No! I won't be a prisoner
in my own house. Margaret...

17:19.160 --> 17:22.319
Patrick, please!
Just show some backbone!

17:29.760 --> 17:33.160
Killed by an axe...or a sword,
or something.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.200
Lady Felicia?
I think I saw the murderer.

17:46.320 --> 17:50.240
He was wearing a horrid raven mask -

17:50.240 --> 17:51.280
like death.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.560
That sounds more like
one of the helpers to me.

17:54.560 --> 17:58.440
No, no, he had
an old black overcoat on and a hat.

17:58.440 --> 18:03.000
Daniel. That godless drunkard -
I knew it.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.120
What do you think, Mr Gillespie?

18:05.120 --> 18:06.560
No!

18:06.560 --> 18:08.360
No, not on the Antirrhinums!

18:09.880 --> 18:12.720
If Danny was going to kill anybody
it would have been Lady Margaret,

18:12.720 --> 18:13.880
he was most angry with her.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.360
Well, I hope he's got a good alibi.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.800
Inspector...about Daniel.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.520
I've known him for years,
he wouldn't hurt a fly.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.160
Look, you may have found a few
sweeties in the treasure hunt,

18:34.160 --> 18:36.800
but this is real detective work.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.960
Sergeant, notify all units that
Daniel Walsh is to be arrested

18:39.960 --> 18:41.360
on suspicion of murder.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.840
I thought I heard jazz.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.520
Shh, I'm hiding. Hiding?

18:54.520 --> 18:56.880
I told you, I don't like crowds. Ah.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.040
So, how are you feeling?

18:59.040 --> 19:01.240
Well, I'm not upset,
if that's what you mean.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.000
I thought the Captain
was a relative?

19:03.000 --> 19:07.080
We were the only family he had.
Daddy's cousin, or something.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.760
Not your favourite person,
then, I take it?

19:09.760 --> 19:11.280
I couldn't stand the man.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.520
Father? The Inspector would
like the guests to congregate

19:16.520 --> 19:17.880
in the drawing room.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.800
I'm sorry, I got a little bit lost.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.480
Down the corridor, turn right.
I mean left.

19:30.720 --> 19:31.960
Have you no shame?!

19:34.840 --> 19:38.200
I'm not going to pretend,
just because he's dead.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.120
Lucia... He made my skin crawl.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.160
That's enough!

19:44.960 --> 19:46.000
I'm sorry.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.520
We're as bad as each other.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.040
I'm nothing like you.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.840
Are you sure you'll be all right?

20:02.840 --> 20:05.440
Yes. After a stiff Martini or two.

20:05.440 --> 20:09.280
I, on the other hand, will go
and light a candle for the Captain.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.880
I'll see you at Mass in the morning,
Father.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.840
I still can't believe
I came face to face with the killer.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.120
I mean, it could have been ME.

20:17.120 --> 20:22.280
I doubt it. The killer seemed
to want to bag himself a magpie.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.800
But which one, I'm not sure.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.400
Identical masks - very odd.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.200
Let's go home, Sid.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.080
I've been looking for you
all morning.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.480
I'm really sorry.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.600
I didn't know.
Nobody tells me anything!

20:58.600 --> 21:00.160
Mummy let you out, did she?

21:00.160 --> 21:03.440
I'm supposed to be at my class.
Well, don't let me keep you.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.120
Thomas, please! It wasn't my fault.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.720
Wasn't it?!

21:07.720 --> 21:10.560
If you hadn't acted like such a tart,
no-one would have noticed.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.520
You don't mean that.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.200
You know, your mother's right
about you -

21:15.200 --> 21:16.760
you really are stupid.

22:03.640 --> 22:06.360
Been everywhere you said,
no-one's seen Daniel.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.880
Looks like he's done a runner.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.320
Well, we need to find him
before THEY do.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.880
Mm. Anything?

22:11.880 --> 22:13.360
Lady Margaret bought the masks.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.720
Insisted on identical ones
for the Professor and the Captain.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.480
Well, they were the main helpers.
She wanted them to look the same.

22:19.480 --> 22:20.600
Possibly.

22:20.600 --> 22:24.720
Or she wanted her husband to look
like HE was the intended victim.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.320
To put the finger on Daniel,
you mean?

22:28.320 --> 22:30.360
You think that... Ssssh!

22:30.360 --> 22:32.520
You think
Lady Margaret's the killer?

22:32.520 --> 22:34.160
I don't think anything...yet.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.400
Hmm.
Well, my money's still on Daniel.

22:36.400 --> 22:41.120
Yes. But you've never backed
a winner in your life.

22:49.960 --> 22:53.560
Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine.
I just have a lot to organise.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.600
Father Brown's coming
to discuss the funeral

22:55.600 --> 22:57.840
and, of course,
there's the servant situation.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.280
Margaret... Cook's walked out -
too frightened to stay.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.760
Margaret, please...

23:01.760 --> 23:03.800
Look, why don't you go
and lie down somewhere?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.400
No, I'm fine. I just have...

23:06.920 --> 23:09.040
(Oh, Patrick...) It's Walsh!

23:10.800 --> 23:12.040
Do something!

23:15.240 --> 23:17.680
It's dead.
You'll have to confront him.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.280
I can't. Patrick, he'll kill us.

23:21.640 --> 23:24.360
Go and lock yourself in your room.
Quickly!

23:24.360 --> 23:25.800
Careful!

23:40.720 --> 23:42.480
Leave us alone!

23:45.360 --> 23:46.840
Professor?

23:46.840 --> 23:48.800
It's Walsh - he was here!

23:48.800 --> 23:51.680
Well, he ain't here now,
so he must have scarpered.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.800
And he dropped this.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.360
Margaret!

24:04.360 --> 24:05.800
Margaret, it's me!

24:05.800 --> 24:08.800
It's safe to come down.
Father Brown's here. Oh, Father!

24:09.880 --> 24:11.440
Where's Lucia?

24:11.440 --> 24:13.080
At a class of hers.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.960
What happened? Did he get away?

24:14.960 --> 24:16.800
Yes. Did you call the police?

24:16.800 --> 24:20.120
He cut the wire.
You'll have to go to the station.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.120
Yes, I suppose I'll have to.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.080
Would you stay and watch my wife?

24:24.080 --> 24:25.640
Course.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.400
I'll take a look around the garden.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.360
But Walsh might still be outside.
I won't go far.

24:30.360 --> 24:33.800
Father, you... Father, you can't,
it's too dangerous. Father!

24:35.720 --> 24:38.920
I think I'll lie down.
I feel a migraine coming on. Yes.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.680
Where are YOU going?

24:42.680 --> 24:44.320
Well, I thought you...

24:44.320 --> 24:45.920
You can watch the front door.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.960
It's all right,
all the other doors are locked.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.560
I'll be as quick as I can.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.400
I was beginning to get worried.
Find anything?

25:28.080 --> 25:30.040
Just a whisky bottle.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.640
Daniel's brand.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.720
Coming in?

25:34.720 --> 25:36.840
Nah, she thinks
I'll nick the silver.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.080
Lady Margaret?

25:48.840 --> 25:50.120
Lady Margaret?!

26:13.200 --> 26:16.440
Present at two murders
in as many days?

26:16.440 --> 26:18.640
Lucky for you
we know who the REAL culprit is.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.080
I wouldn't be too sure.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.120
Father, all the evidence
points to Walsh.

26:23.120 --> 26:26.800
So you've worked out what
the number nine on the pillow means?

26:26.800 --> 26:29.320
We're working on it.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.040
You! You were supposed to be
watching her!

26:32.040 --> 26:34.320
Enough! Professor, please!

26:39.160 --> 26:40.760
I'm sorry.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.960
I really am.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.040
I know you're upset,
but you need to calm down.

26:56.560 --> 27:00.320
I really didn't think Daniel would
come back, not with us there.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.560
It's a pity we didn't have more time
to look around.

27:03.560 --> 27:06.240
Mm. I think I'll go back.

27:06.240 --> 27:09.120
They'll still be searching the area.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.600
Tomorrow morning, then.

27:10.600 --> 27:14.160
Yeah, well, for what's it worth,
I'm coming with you this time.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.520
Do you really think
Daniel is innocent?

27:17.520 --> 27:18.960
I don't know any more.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.960
Too many unanswered questions.
Like the number nine?

27:21.960 --> 27:24.880
How did the killer get through
the locked back door?

27:24.880 --> 27:26.600
Thomas. Thomas?

27:26.600 --> 27:30.120
Yeah, Thomas. He's got keys from
every place he's ever worked at.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.680
Sells them
to any tea leaf who'll buy 'em.

27:32.680 --> 27:35.480
Where will I find him?
Red Lion, probably.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.520
All right, I'll give you a knock
in the morning, yeah?

27:38.520 --> 27:40.400
Sid... Yeah?

27:40.400 --> 27:43.480
It REALLY wasn't your fault.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.480
Heard about your mother.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.960
Can't say I'm sorry. You're sick.

28:08.960 --> 28:13.000
She killed Daniel's dad -
everyone knows!

28:13.000 --> 28:14.920
You know it was an accident.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.040
She drove straight at him!

28:24.920 --> 28:26.320
Sorry, Father...

28:27.400 --> 28:29.720
..but that family deserve
all they get.

28:29.720 --> 28:33.200
You have quite a few run-ins
with them.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.800
I heard they sacked you
without notice.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.560
The Captain's doing.
Dirty swine was jealous.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.240
Of you and Lucia? Obsessed.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.240
Couldn't stand the thought
of anyone else...

28:50.320 --> 28:51.920
Well, you know.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.360
Did she tell her mother?

28:55.360 --> 28:57.680
I doubt it. She hated her guts.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.160
Really?

28:59.160 --> 29:01.720
Her mother treated her
like a prisoner.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.600
Kept her inside most days. Hm.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.440
Right...

29:12.600 --> 29:14.320
Rather a lot of keys.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.160
Yeah.

29:17.160 --> 29:20.720
I'd just be careful. If any of those
are from the manor...

29:21.840 --> 29:23.920
..people might get the wrong idea.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.360
About what?

29:25.360 --> 29:27.280
Haven't you heard?

29:27.280 --> 29:29.720
The killer had a key
to the back door.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.800
Well, I was here. I've got an alibi.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.160
Well, I wasn't suggesting...
And anyway, I never had a key.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.000
Course, you know who did.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.720
She used to sneak out at night
to see me,

29:43.720 --> 29:45.320
through the back door.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.240
You must think I'm evil.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.000
And I suppose I am.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.720
(Forgive me.)

30:16.520 --> 30:17.960
Lucia.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.600
Father.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.040
I need to confess.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.520
I-I can't say it.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.960
God will hate me.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.000
No. God will forgive you.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.160
My mother's death...

30:52.600 --> 30:54.480
I don't feel anything.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.760
No sadness, no upset.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.880
Just a kind of relief.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.720
Is THAT what you wanted to confess?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.160
Yes.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.720
And why do you think
you feel this way?

31:13.720 --> 31:15.560
If I'm honest...

31:16.800 --> 31:19.080
I don't think she ever loved me.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.960
She was ashamed of me.

31:23.160 --> 31:26.640
But I still should feel something.
It's not normal.

31:28.480 --> 31:33.160
There's something wrong with me...
something missing.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.840
Not at all.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.720
You don't understand, Father...

31:38.120 --> 31:40.400
My brain doesn't work properly.

31:40.400 --> 31:44.240
Maybe I'm just not clever enough
to realise how serious it is.

31:44.240 --> 31:45.960
Do you really believe that?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.760
Ever since I was little,
people have said how...

31:50.760 --> 31:53.680
how...slow I am.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.640
In what way?

31:57.760 --> 32:00.400
I've never been able to read
properly.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.960
Letters...numbers...

32:03.960 --> 32:07.080
I get them all jumbled up
and back to front.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.760
I can't even tell
my left from my right!

32:14.880 --> 32:19.040
Lucia, just because you think
differently from other people,

32:19.040 --> 32:22.600
because you're drawn
to the visual beauty of the world,

32:22.600 --> 32:26.600
doesn't make you any less
intelligent - far from it.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.520
Look at your designs.
That's not intelligence.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.400
But it is! It is!

32:34.480 --> 32:36.680
They're clever, insightful...

32:36.680 --> 32:43.240
Anyone who can do what you do is
a very BRIGHT individual indeed.

32:50.640 --> 32:53.160
Father, are you there?

32:53.160 --> 32:54.720
I've just heard!

32:54.720 --> 32:57.040
Poor Lady Margaret!

32:57.040 --> 32:59.280
Have you any idea who did it?

32:59.280 --> 33:01.000
Afraid not.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.840
Everyone knows
it was that Daniel Walsh.

33:03.840 --> 33:08.000
Well, if it is, I can't help
feeling partly responsible.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.160
You?!

33:10.680 --> 33:12.840
I knew he was going to visit
the Galloways

33:12.840 --> 33:14.520
and I did little to stop him.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.520
Oh, you mustn't blame yourself!

33:18.880 --> 33:22.000
If I could only work out
what the number nine means.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.880
Father, I'm sure
if we put our heads together...

33:24.880 --> 33:28.720
Right! Let's see
what we can come up with.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.960
Think of anything with a nine in it.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.120
Nine lives...

33:34.120 --> 33:36.720
Er, cloud nine.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.280
Er...nine ladies dancing.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.440
Cat o' nine tails.
A stitch in time.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.800
The whole nine yards.
Dressed to the nines.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.480
Nine, nine, nine! Ladies...

33:45.480 --> 33:50.920
I always think that solitude and
thinking are the best bedfellows.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.960
Of course. How silly of me, Father.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.840
I will leave you to it.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.840
Yes. Me too. Sorry, Father.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.920
Disturbing the Father like that!

34:02.920 --> 34:06.280
I was giving him moral support!
Unlike some!

34:08.760 --> 34:11.520
Ninth symphony...

34:11.520 --> 34:13.679
Ninth commandment...

34:14.960 --> 34:16.840
The ninth circle of Hell...

34:49.600 --> 34:51.199
Of course!

36:28.960 --> 36:30.880
Father!

36:32.000 --> 36:33.840
Professor.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.680
Is it Walsh?

36:38.200 --> 36:40.720
What happened? Did you see anyone?

36:40.720 --> 36:42.520
He's been dead for days.

36:44.320 --> 36:47.920
But this doesn't make any sense.
I was sure that he...

36:47.920 --> 36:49.680
Have you contacted the police?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.240
No.

36:56.760 --> 36:59.800
I really thought
that he was the killer...

36:59.800 --> 37:04.000
That's what everybody was supposed
to think. He was framed.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.280
Why?!

37:10.600 --> 37:14.040
He came here looking for answers...

37:14.040 --> 37:16.040
and met his death.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.280
Ahh!

37:21.120 --> 37:23.480
With him dead and hidden,
he had no alibi.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.520
Poor soul.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.840
His soul will be saved.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.640
As for the murderer's...

37:38.680 --> 37:41.080
You don't thi...?

37:41.080 --> 37:43.720
Have you taken leave of your senses?!

37:43.720 --> 37:47.080
I came here to bring you to yours.

37:47.080 --> 37:50.440
Father, you're not thinking straight.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.240
Professor, please.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.880
I was on my way to the police station
when my wife was killed.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.720
You know that!

37:57.760 --> 38:01.360
You had time to pull up,
double back through the woods.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.640
You knew that I was
searching the gardens,

38:03.640 --> 38:05.840
that Sid was watching
the front gate.

38:05.840 --> 38:10.000
This is absurd! And you knew your
wife was sleeping in her bedroom.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.400
Yeah, and then I just let myself in
and murdered her?!

38:12.400 --> 38:14.680
Do you think I'm actually capable
of such a thing?

38:14.680 --> 38:17.480
Professor...
you don't need to pretend any more.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.880
Oh, Patrick! It's Walsh!

38:22.480 --> 38:24.000
'I should've seen it before.'

38:32.800 --> 38:35.400
Lock yourself in your room - quickly!

38:35.400 --> 38:38.240
'And while Lady Margaret
locked herself in her room,

38:38.240 --> 38:41.480
'you disposed of Lucia's mannequin
in the back of your car.'

38:42.520 --> 38:47.560
So is this all merely intuition?
Guesswork?

38:47.560 --> 38:49.880
The number on my ticket,

38:49.880 --> 38:51.920
the wrong way round.

38:51.920 --> 38:56.280
Like the "P" written in blood
on her pillow.

38:56.280 --> 38:57.680
"P"...

39:00.760 --> 39:02.120
Patrick.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.520
She never could tell her left
from her right...

39:06.520 --> 39:08.040
Like Lucia.

39:08.040 --> 39:13.240
Yes. She inherited it from her.
She deserved everything she got.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.840
Her and the Captain!

39:15.840 --> 39:19.560
In the name of God,
have you no remorse?

39:19.560 --> 39:23.880
They humiliated me!
Hotels...weekends away.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.640
Even in our own bed.

39:25.640 --> 39:27.800
Daniel - what was his crime?

39:29.960 --> 39:32.560
He was a scapegoat.

39:32.560 --> 39:36.440
Is life worth so little?

39:36.440 --> 39:38.960
Look at him... Look at him!

39:43.280 --> 39:45.120
You can't undo what you've done,

39:45.120 --> 39:48.800
but you could still save yourself.

39:48.800 --> 39:52.640
Are you ready to repent?

40:02.680 --> 40:04.480
I'm waiting, Father.

40:10.640 --> 40:14.920
I can't just absolve you
of all your sins.

40:14.920 --> 40:19.120
You need truly be sorry
for what you've done.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.720
No... What I need...

40:24.200 --> 40:25.920
is for you to remain kneeling.

40:31.040 --> 40:34.280
Do you really think you have
the right to take a life?

40:34.280 --> 40:38.400
People are divided into the primitive
and the superhuman.

40:39.920 --> 40:43.120
Now, my intellect clearly puts me
in the latter category.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.760
No, you've been misguided.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.120
It's compassion...

40:53.120 --> 40:55.920
humanity that sets us apart.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.760
Now, please...

40:57.760 --> 40:59.600
let me help you.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.400
You're a clever fellow, Father,

41:03.400 --> 41:06.680
but you seriously underestimated me.

41:06.680 --> 41:11.360
And for that flaw,
you will have to pay the price.

41:11.360 --> 41:16.960
What price you will pay...
when you kneel before God?

41:16.960 --> 41:22.760
In the words of Nietzsche -
"God is dead".

41:50.160 --> 41:53.480
Oh...

41:55.560 --> 41:59.000
No, no, no, no, no...

42:00.960 --> 42:03.400
I heard Mr Gillespie whining.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.200
Thank you.

42:08.600 --> 42:11.440
What you were saying about Mummy...

42:11.440 --> 42:13.480
If we were the same...

42:13.480 --> 42:15.400
Why was she so hard on you?

42:16.960 --> 42:21.480
Maybe she wanted you to overcome
something she couldn't.

42:23.120 --> 42:26.960
Not feel the shame
that she'd always felt.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.600
So she did care...

42:28.600 --> 42:30.840
she really did.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.680
Lucia, no!

42:38.040 --> 42:40.920
He doesn't deserve saving.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.680
But you most definitely do.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.480
Unbelievable.

43:10.480 --> 43:13.480
Wherever you go, you seem to leave
a trail of corpses.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.680
Talk about the face of death!

43:15.680 --> 43:18.600
Well, at least you got your man.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.840
Yes.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.840
Do you think Mummy
was a murderer too?

43:27.840 --> 43:29.840
You mean Daniel's father?

43:29.840 --> 43:34.320
It's what people think -
that she drove straight at him.

43:34.320 --> 43:38.800
Like you, your mother
didn't just have problems
with her reading and writing -

43:38.800 --> 43:41.200
she couldn't tell her left
from her right.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.840
You think she hit the accelerator
instead of the brake.

44:03.440 --> 44:06.720
Well, she certainly didn't
have any reason to murder him.

44:06.720 --> 44:10.120
She wasn't like your father.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.640
Father, I heard what happened.

44:23.640 --> 44:26.440
I'm... Well, I'm very glad
you're all right...

44:26.440 --> 44:28.480
Me too.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.320
Daniel.
