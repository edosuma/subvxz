WEBVTT

00:05.300 --> 00:08.170
I want you to teach me how to be mad.

00:10.820 --> 00:15.010
He plans to trap himself a fairy
and to return to England with it

00:15.060 --> 00:18.160
and restore magic to
its rightful place.

00:19.340 --> 00:20.540
Yes!

00:21.860 --> 00:22.890
Argh!

00:22.940 --> 00:26.170
I should take something of the
Lady's to signify my claim.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.290
Who was the last English
magician you dealt with?

00:28.340 --> 00:30.810
~ I do not have to tell you that.
~ What token did he give you?

00:30.860 --> 00:33.260
~ I do not...
~ Bring it to me.

00:34.020 --> 00:36.810
~ Are you alive?
~ She has forgotten you.
~ What?

00:36.860 --> 00:38.890
Do you wish to dance with me, sir?

00:38.940 --> 00:41.090
Stop!

00:41.140 --> 00:42.810
Arabella!

00:42.860 --> 00:45.860
I demand that you give
me back my wife.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.180
Argh!

00:52.180 --> 00:53.970
Can I not help you?

00:54.020 --> 00:55.810
When the time is right,
you will know.

00:55.860 --> 00:57.330
Aaah!

00:57.380 --> 00:59.050
You must deliver three messages.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.840
Three messages. Do you understand?

01:02.580 --> 01:05.319
Show me this book if there is one.

01:06.620 --> 01:07.930
Let us kill him.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.930
You will discover I
am very hard to kill.

01:10.980 --> 01:13.740
Oh, no. Sir, please, no.

01:16.620 --> 01:18.050
He told me I would be king.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.250
Of course you will, dear Stephen.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.770
He has it written all over him.

01:22.820 --> 01:25.820
It says, "The magicians will fail".

02:03.260 --> 02:04.730
Order!

02:04.780 --> 02:06.580
Sir Walter Pole.

02:10.220 --> 02:13.290
I have here letters from
the Lords Lieutenant

02:13.340 --> 02:17.410
of Lincolnshire, Yorkshire,
Cornwall, Somerset

02:17.460 --> 02:22.610
and Warwickshire, all complaining
of the disruptive new magic

02:22.660 --> 02:25.930
which has recently been
seen in those counties.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.290
We all, I'm sure, can
report similar stories.

02:30.340 --> 02:33.250
The mirrors of England are broken.

02:33.300 --> 02:38.620
We now border upon lands about
which no-one knows anything.

02:40.780 --> 02:45.450
Mr Strange has opened the doors between
England and the other realms

02:45.500 --> 02:50.770
and in doing so, he has brought
magic flooding back in.

02:50.820 --> 02:54.060
We do not know his reasons.
It is said he has gone mad.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.850
It is said he is
returning from Venice

02:57.900 --> 03:00.900
and bringing his Black
Tower with him.

03:10.860 --> 03:15.330
We can only assume he is coming here
and that he means to do us harm.

03:19.180 --> 03:22.530
Before these men, before
Mr Strange and Mr Norrell,

03:22.580 --> 03:24.920
magic was dead in England.

03:25.660 --> 03:29.650
It was part of history and not...

03:29.700 --> 03:31.500
not respectable.

03:36.460 --> 03:40.260
I deeply regret my part in
bringing it back to life.

03:41.220 --> 03:44.860
It should have been left alone,
it entails nothing but horrors.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.620
To speak personally for a moment...

03:50.340 --> 03:54.610
To speak personally, I can
scarcely describe my feelings.

03:54.660 --> 03:58.250
It is not treason exactly
what Mr Strange has done.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.770
Lady Pole. Lady Pole, please wake up.

04:00.820 --> 04:04.520
I suppose it is a... It is
a species of revolution.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.010
Where is Mr Norrell, sir?

04:08.060 --> 04:10.930
Mr Norrell has returned to Yorkshire.

04:18.579 --> 04:20.610
Order!

04:20.660 --> 04:23.970
I must say, I find it hard to think
of any more distasteful report

04:24.020 --> 04:26.930
that has ever been delivered
to this House.

04:26.980 --> 04:29.770
With that in mind, I
tender my resignation

04:29.820 --> 04:33.810
as a Minister of the Crown
and a Member of this House.

04:33.860 --> 04:35.730
Absurd!

04:38.340 --> 04:39.810
Where is Norrell?

04:39.860 --> 04:41.860
Where is Mr Norrell?

04:50.340 --> 04:54.770
Stephen, good morning. Will
you prepare my carriage?

04:54.820 --> 04:57.360
I would like to visit my wife.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.730
Oh, Henry.

05:05.780 --> 05:08.850
Thank goodness you are here.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.850
You were to remain at Venice
until Strange left,

05:11.900 --> 05:14.100
I told you that plainly.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.410
You have to take me to London.

05:17.460 --> 05:20.930
Why did you not kill him?
No-one would have known.

05:20.980 --> 05:22.370
I would have done it.

05:22.420 --> 05:23.890
Go to Venice and try.

05:23.940 --> 05:25.890
Where is he now? What did he say?

05:25.940 --> 05:30.530
He's trapped within an
awful tower of black.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.570
Oh, Henry! The terror of it!

05:35.740 --> 05:38.280
~ He's plotting.
~ Plotting what?

05:38.900 --> 05:40.490
Revenge.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.010
He gave me a letter
for Lady Pole, and...

05:43.060 --> 05:44.460
Show me.

05:45.660 --> 05:48.130
I've already sent it.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.850
~ What else?
~ I'm to...

05:49.900 --> 05:54.620
To tell Childermass that Norrell had
a fairy to help him raise Lady Pole.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.580
He sold her.

06:00.100 --> 06:04.010
And to give Childermass proof
of what Norrell has done.

06:04.060 --> 06:07.330
A box with instructions inside.

06:07.380 --> 06:11.850
~ Give them to me.
~ No, I... I must give them to Childermass.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.250
He's to take them to Lady Pole
and when Strange sends word...

06:15.300 --> 06:17.570
Give them to me.

06:21.460 --> 06:25.820
And I am to tell Norrell that...

06:27.140 --> 06:30.140
.. er, that Strange
is... is coming back.

06:37.380 --> 06:40.540
Disgusting superstitious nonsense.

06:44.860 --> 06:46.050
You are a fool.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.770
I must deliver it!

06:47.820 --> 06:49.810
These are important instructions.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.730
Strange will kill me.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.410
~ Ah!
~ Do you not understand?

06:53.460 --> 06:56.410
Your messages will never
be delivered, except the one

06:56.460 --> 06:59.820
for Norrell, and that
I shall deliver myself.

07:11.220 --> 07:12.490
Argh!

07:15.180 --> 07:18.490
Henry. Please. Please...!

07:18.540 --> 07:23.010
Do you honestly believe I would
allow you to destroy Norrell?

07:23.060 --> 07:24.970
Which is to say, destroy me?

07:25.020 --> 07:27.210
Henry, please. Please!

07:40.660 --> 07:43.050
It is well you have come, sir.

07:43.100 --> 07:46.700
Lady Pole has taken to
her bed for some days now.

07:57.860 --> 08:01.210
We cannot wake her, sir,
as much as we have tried.

08:01.260 --> 08:03.170
The doctors have found nothing.

08:03.220 --> 08:07.460
It is our belief, sir, that
Lady Pole is not mad at all.

08:09.020 --> 08:12.020
We believe she is under
an enchantment.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.640
Who writes to my wife?

08:19.660 --> 08:21.530
Jonathan Strange.

08:30.340 --> 08:31.890
May I speak with you a while?

08:31.940 --> 08:33.809
It would be a pleasure.

08:33.860 --> 08:38.559
I have been in contact with your
husband. I am to watch over you.

08:39.179 --> 08:42.409
When the time of our disenchantment
comes, I will show you the path.

08:42.460 --> 08:46.130
Until then, please try to hold
some memory of who you once were.

08:46.180 --> 08:48.530
~ And of your husband.
~ Husband?

08:48.580 --> 08:53.530
My ladies, this is the
very picture of beauty.

08:53.580 --> 08:59.610
To see my two rarest and finest
flowers entwined so happily.

08:59.660 --> 09:03.650
You know, it is said, that in the
lands on the far side of Hell,

09:03.700 --> 09:07.780
they dance a dance of three partners.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.170
I was taught it once,

09:11.220 --> 09:12.650
4,000 years ago,

09:12.700 --> 09:16.130
but sadly, I have
forgotten the steps.

09:16.180 --> 09:22.060
So, I shall content myself
with just... one partner.

09:23.540 --> 09:25.170
My lady.

09:25.220 --> 09:26.610
Allow me.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.860
(Stay safe, my friend.)

09:46.260 --> 09:50.860
Ah! Your coachman made a
leisurely ride of it, I see.

09:51.860 --> 09:55.530
~ Where's Drawlight?
~ Yes. Strange gave Drawlight a message.

09:55.580 --> 09:57.450
What does it say?

09:58.380 --> 10:01.490
He says that he is
coming. That is all.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.210
Strange is coming to England?

10:03.260 --> 10:05.970
~ To you, sir.
~ To do what?

10:06.020 --> 10:11.290
To fight. To exact
his supposed revenge.

10:11.340 --> 10:13.730
Oh, my dear lord.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.410
But, sir. No, sir.

10:16.460 --> 10:19.530
Sir, this is our chance
to destroy him completely.

10:19.580 --> 10:24.490
~ Establish you as the only
authority on magic in the realm.
~ To fight?

10:24.540 --> 10:28.290
What on earth were you thinking?
To come here without Drawlight?

10:28.340 --> 10:30.810
~ Where is he?
~ He's gone back to Bruton Street.

10:30.860 --> 10:33.610
Bruton Street? Our
Lucas will fetch him.

10:33.660 --> 10:35.170
They'll have him here by tomorrow.

10:35.220 --> 10:36.970
~ .. Lucas!
~ No! No, no, no, no.

10:37.020 --> 10:39.050
He's gone to visit
an uncle in Chatham.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.810
~ Where in Chatham?
~ I do not know.

10:41.860 --> 10:44.130
I need to strengthen the
labyrinth around my library.

10:44.180 --> 10:47.610
I will be safe there. We must hurry.

10:47.660 --> 10:49.940
Bloody useless.

10:52.180 --> 10:53.530
I have been wondering.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.930
Have there ever been magical
duels in the past?

10:55.980 --> 10:58.610
Struggles between magicians?
That sort of thing.

10:58.660 --> 11:02.370
Ralph Stokesey seems to have fought
two or three magicians by magic.

11:02.420 --> 11:05.730
And then there is a curious tale
of the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner.

11:05.780 --> 11:08.890
Did such duels ever result in the
death of one of the magicians?

11:08.940 --> 11:10.930
What? Er, no. I do not think so.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.650
The magic must exist, surely?

11:12.700 --> 11:14.690
If you gave your mind to
it, I dare say, you could

11:14.740 --> 11:17.330
think of half a dozen spells
that would do the trick.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.450
~ Or you could make one up.
~ I do not make magic up.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.090
It would be like a common
duel with pistols or swords.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.250
There would be no question
of prosecution.

11:25.300 --> 11:26.490
It will not come to that.

11:26.540 --> 11:28.930
My dear Mr Norrell, what else
could it possibly come to?

11:28.980 --> 11:30.770
Magic has apparently
returned to England.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.850
England needs a magical leader.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.580
You, sir. We must clear your
path of every obstacle.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.210
Fear not, sir.

11:39.260 --> 11:46.500
I will help, I will advise, I will
be with you all the way to the top.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.090
What do your little cards say now?

11:56.140 --> 12:00.170
They say you are a liar and a thief.

12:00.220 --> 12:05.490
They say that you have been given
something, an object of great value.

12:05.540 --> 12:08.330
It is meant for me
and yet you retain it.

12:08.380 --> 12:11.170
How dare you address a gentleman
in such a fashion.

12:11.220 --> 12:14.620
Is it the act of a gentleman
to steal from me?

12:15.620 --> 12:20.210
You whoreson, you dregs of every
Yorkshire gutter. Apologise!

12:20.260 --> 12:22.860
Better a whoreson than a thief.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.330
I will teach you better manners.

12:35.660 --> 12:37.200
It is done!

12:38.180 --> 12:41.770
We are safe as long as
we remain in this room.

12:41.820 --> 12:43.690
~ Mr Lascelles.
~ He called me a thief!

12:43.740 --> 12:47.250
He is a thief. He stole this.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.100
Give that back!

12:50.580 --> 12:52.580
Mr Strange sent it.

12:55.020 --> 12:57.820
And my cards say Drawlight is dead.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.170
Sir, what colours will this
man show when Strange arrives?

13:02.220 --> 13:06.130
This law unto himself, who receives
gifts from your enemy.

13:06.180 --> 13:08.970
Your enemy meant me to
take it to Lady Pole.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.490
With your permission, sir,
that is what I will do.

13:12.540 --> 13:14.730
No.

13:14.780 --> 13:17.690
No, you do not have my
permission. You cannot take it.

13:17.740 --> 13:19.330
Goodbye, Mr Norrell.

13:19.380 --> 13:22.820
You've made the wrong
choice, sir. As usual.

13:23.940 --> 13:26.500
Traitor. Johannite.

13:28.980 --> 13:32.260
If I were you, Mr Lascelles,
I would speak more guardedly.

13:33.620 --> 13:37.340
You are in the North now. Our laws
were made by the Raven King.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.930
Our towns and abbeys
were founded by him.

13:40.980 --> 13:43.850
Mr Norrell's house was built by him.

13:44.940 --> 13:49.900
He's in our minds and hearts and
speech. And he's coming back.

13:52.220 --> 13:53.980
Childermass...

13:55.100 --> 13:56.900
Give me the box.

14:03.020 --> 14:04.930
The Raven King.

14:04.980 --> 14:07.980
Always the last resort
of vulgar minds.

14:09.020 --> 14:10.370
Come here and face me!

14:10.420 --> 14:13.610
Mr Lascelles! We mustn't
leave the library!

14:13.660 --> 14:16.610
Come back! Mr Lascelles!

14:16.660 --> 14:18.890
Stay with me. You'll get lost!

14:18.940 --> 14:20.410
Mr Lascelles!

14:20.460 --> 14:22.730
<Childermass, you coward!

14:33.140 --> 14:35.880
Childermass! Come out and face me!

14:37.620 --> 14:39.450
Mr Norrell?

14:39.500 --> 14:41.170
Mr Lascelles!

14:42.220 --> 14:43.760
Mr Norrell!

14:44.380 --> 14:45.920
Mr Norrell!

14:55.660 --> 14:58.050
Childermass!

15:02.460 --> 15:04.010
Mr Norrell! Unlock this door!

15:04.060 --> 15:06.490
~ Mr Norrell!
~ Mr Lascelles!

15:16.580 --> 15:18.180
Who's there?

15:20.460 --> 15:22.000
Mr Norrell!

15:30.460 --> 15:33.200
Seven people from Norwich in 1124.

15:34.540 --> 15:38.220
Four from Aysgarth in Yorkshire,
Christmas, in 1151.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.220
23 at Exeter in 1201.

15:44.380 --> 15:48.180
One at Hathersage in
Derbyshire in 1243.

15:51.500 --> 15:54.170
It was a problem he never solved.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.890
~ I beg your pardon?
~ The Raven King.

15:58.940 --> 16:01.090
He could not prevent
fairies stealing away

16:01.140 --> 16:02.410
Christian men and women.

16:02.460 --> 16:06.250
Why should I suppose myself capable
of something he was not?

16:06.300 --> 16:08.170
Where is Childermass?

16:08.220 --> 16:11.410
He is gone. He received a...

16:11.460 --> 16:13.970
A box from you and he left.

16:14.020 --> 16:16.730
I like your labyrinth.
You use Hickman?

16:16.780 --> 16:22.130
De Chepe. A minor scholar,
but very good at labyrinths.

16:22.180 --> 16:25.770
It was meant to be impenetrable.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.890
How did you break it?

16:29.380 --> 16:32.940
I did what I usually do, copied
you and added some refinements.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.690
Argh!

16:40.740 --> 16:43.810
Please. Please, Mr Strange. Please!

16:43.860 --> 16:45.770
It is not I.

16:45.820 --> 16:47.850
It is the fairy's curse.

16:47.900 --> 16:51.690
The spell grows stronger, and I
weaker. I do not have much time.

16:51.740 --> 16:54.330
What did you expect? Opening
the pathways to other lands.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.530
Breaking everyone's mirrors.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.410
Disreputable magic, sir!

16:58.460 --> 17:00.660
This is its consequence.

17:07.740 --> 17:08.940
Ah!

17:10.980 --> 17:12.859
~ Ah!
~ Boo.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.900
Please, Mr Strange. Please!

17:20.099 --> 17:23.770
Get out of my library, sir, or
I give you warning I shall...

17:23.819 --> 17:28.170
~ I shall...
~ Do your very worse, Mr
Norrell. I am changed.

17:28.220 --> 17:33.120
~ Do you really believe
you can challenge me now?
~ I have warned you.

17:58.980 --> 18:01.380
Do not laugh at me. Please.

18:04.140 --> 18:06.210
It is cruel to laugh.

18:10.060 --> 18:11.860
Rain is very...

18:14.860 --> 18:17.730
I may not have your imagination, sir.

18:18.340 --> 18:20.770
I may not be as daring
a magician but...

18:20.820 --> 18:23.820
You do yourself a
disservice, Mr Norrell.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.900
I'm sorry I laughed.

18:29.460 --> 18:31.770
You have not come here to kill me?

18:31.820 --> 18:33.220
No, sir.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.450
~ But I have been your enemy.
~ Yes.

18:40.100 --> 18:43.660
I have slandered and plotted against
you. Why are you not angry?

18:46.420 --> 18:49.020
Because I do not have the time.

18:51.140 --> 18:53.810
My wife is stolen and I am dying.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.340
This darkness will kill me before
I can save her if I work alone.

19:00.380 --> 19:01.720
Alone?

19:03.220 --> 19:06.690
You wish something from me?

19:06.740 --> 19:08.280
What is it?

19:09.460 --> 19:11.930
What I've always wanted, sir.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.040
Your help.

19:42.940 --> 19:45.490
Good lord, Mr Childermass, whatever
happened to your face?

19:45.540 --> 19:48.940
Someone mistook it for
an apple, Mr Honeyfoot.

19:49.060 --> 19:50.660
.. Mr Black.

19:55.060 --> 19:58.450
Childermass? I wish to speak
urgently to your master.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.820
He's with Mr Strange.
Excuse my interruption.

20:04.260 --> 20:06.660
Mr Strange sent this to me.

20:07.380 --> 20:11.280
I think he intended that
we use it to help your wife.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.180
Then it is true.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.450
I had thought this the
ravings of a madman.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.290
Is it from Strange? May I see it?

20:23.340 --> 20:27.050
~ He writes that you serve
this creature, Stephen?
~ Sir.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.250
~ Whose servant have you been?
~ Sir Walter.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.170
~ You have betrayed the trust of my family.
~ Please, sir.

20:32.220 --> 20:35.010
You have colluded in the theft
and torture of your lady.

20:35.060 --> 20:37.730
Please, sir. May I speak freely?

20:43.060 --> 20:45.400
There was once a priest...

20:46.820 --> 20:48.130
What?

20:48.180 --> 20:52.370
There was once a priest called
Elidorus who... who hid in...

20:52.420 --> 20:55.090
Hid himself in... in a
hollow be-beneath a tree.

20:55.140 --> 20:58.490
~ Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey...
~ No. No, please.
~ You are a savage.

20:58.540 --> 21:02.010
In order to commune
with what he believed!

21:02.060 --> 21:04.290
~ Lock him up.
~ Honeyfoot!

21:07.940 --> 21:10.690
~ Daniel!
~ Careful. Get him out.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.450
Get him out.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.260
Sir Walter!

21:18.900 --> 21:20.210
If I understand correctly,

21:20.260 --> 21:23.610
your wife is under a very
particular magical contract.

21:23.660 --> 21:26.970
To break such a thing
is very hard. Er...

21:27.020 --> 21:29.330
As I recall, Belasis says
the 100th anniversary

21:29.380 --> 21:32.210
of the bargain is often
an auspicious moment.

21:32.260 --> 21:33.490
Arabella.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.730
I have his book here.

21:35.780 --> 21:38.930
Lady Pole. As I understand
it, the death of the enchanter

21:38.980 --> 21:41.850
brings to an end all such contracts.

21:44.660 --> 21:48.130
~ Immediately.
~ No English magician has ever killed a fairy.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.850
~ Not since the Raven King.
~ But it can be done.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.730
Mr Strange, it is my strong advice

21:52.780 --> 21:55.090
that you do not set
yourself against him.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.810
You will only bring a worse
fate upon yourself.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.890
Upon those around you.

21:59.940 --> 22:03.530
What worse fate could
I suffer? Tell me.

22:03.580 --> 22:05.970
I am dying and my wife is
a prisoner of the creature

22:06.020 --> 22:08.490
you unleashed upon the world.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.690
I do not know what
you are talking about.

22:11.740 --> 22:15.840
I do not know any creature.
I do not know what you mean.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.240
Enough.

22:24.540 --> 22:28.210
~ He cheated me.
~ Of course he cheated
you, that is his nature.

22:28.260 --> 22:32.170
You knew that as well as anyone.
You will have read it in your books.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.620
I only meant to do it once.

22:35.060 --> 22:36.330
I tried time and time again

22:36.380 --> 22:38.530
to prevent you from falling
into my mistake.

22:38.580 --> 22:41.410
You might have done that
by telling me the truth.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.090
We cannot kill a fairy.

22:43.140 --> 22:46.450
This is your
responsibility, Mr Norrell.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.650
All that has happened has been a
direct consequence of your actions.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.970
You unlocked a door that had
been sealed for centuries

22:52.020 --> 22:54.330
and you had not the courage
to close it again.

22:54.380 --> 22:58.610
I'm sorry, but I have absolutely
no idea how to help you.

22:58.660 --> 23:02.610
I do not have the knowledge
to fight or defeat a fairy.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.740
And if I get it wrong, my
wife would be lost forever.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.570
So, I set to thinking.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.930
And I thought how there was
one man in all the world,

23:13.980 --> 23:15.650
in all the worlds that ever were,

23:15.700 --> 23:17.930
who would know how
to defeat my enemy.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.890
One man who would know
what magic to do.

23:21.940 --> 23:24.130
I realised the time had
come to speak to him.

23:24.180 --> 23:26.450
But I must tell you...

23:26.500 --> 23:30.000
that I no longer regard
myself as your superior.

23:30.460 --> 23:33.700
~ My reading has been more
extensive than yours...
~ I did not mean you.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.720
I meant John Uskglass.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.420
The Raven King.

23:42.380 --> 23:45.480
No magician has killed
a fairy since he.

23:46.180 --> 23:48.570
I intend to summon him here.

23:48.620 --> 23:52.410
I intend to place all of
English magic into his hands

23:52.460 --> 23:55.130
and then I shall command
him to do it.

23:55.180 --> 23:57.890
There is a danger, sir,

23:57.940 --> 24:00.770
that if we succeed
in breaking the spell

24:00.820 --> 24:04.290
the Lady will return to the
state she was in before.

24:04.340 --> 24:06.080
Namely, death.

24:08.260 --> 24:12.860
She has often said she would rather
be dead than as she now is.

24:13.420 --> 24:15.930
You should try what you can do.

24:15.980 --> 24:18.850
Summoning the Raven King
is a very dangerous idea.

24:18.900 --> 24:22.490
The greatest difficulty is that
we do not know what to call him.

24:22.540 --> 24:25.250
The spells of summoning, especially
the old spells of election,

24:25.300 --> 24:27.370
require that one be most
particular about names.

24:27.420 --> 24:28.810
Surely John Uskglass is his name?

24:28.860 --> 24:31.370
That is the name of the Norman
aristocrat who the Raven King,

24:31.420 --> 24:34.890
our John Uskglass, claimed as his
father. But that is most disputed.

24:34.940 --> 24:37.970
~ It need not matter that
we do not know his name.
~ Of course it matters!

24:38.020 --> 24:40.490
He was stolen into Faerie before
he could be christened!

24:40.540 --> 24:41.810
If we use an ordinary spell...

24:41.860 --> 24:45.050
No, he became the nameless slave, Mr
Strange. "Nameless" being the key.

24:45.100 --> 24:47.330
But if we use an ordinary
English spell of summoning

24:47.380 --> 24:50.050
then we can make the elements of
the spell identify him for us.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.090
~ Can we not?
~ No, no, no, no. Of course, we cannot!

24:52.140 --> 24:53.370
I never heard of such a thing!

24:53.420 --> 24:55.970
This house was built upon the
Raven King's land, correct?

24:56.020 --> 24:57.970
With stones from the King's Abbey.

24:58.020 --> 25:02.010
The river that runs outside
bore the King on its waters.

25:02.060 --> 25:04.730
And in...

25:04.780 --> 25:07.520
And in my garden is a pear tree...

25:08.260 --> 25:11.930
.. that is a direct descendent
of some pips that the King

25:11.980 --> 25:14.210
spat out when he sat in the garden.

25:14.260 --> 25:17.930
If we let the Abbey stones be our
envoy. The river be our path.

25:17.980 --> 25:21.730
And the orchard pears be a handsel
then we may name him simply,

25:21.780 --> 25:23.290
"The King".

25:23.340 --> 25:26.810
And the rivers and stones and the
trees, they do not know any other.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.860
Which summoning spell
should we employ?

25:33.100 --> 25:35.900
This book contains the best I know.

25:55.500 --> 25:59.100
It is the spell you used
to summon Maria Absalom.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.460
This is my book.

26:02.980 --> 26:06.180
I could not destroy it
utterly, Mr Strange.

26:07.540 --> 26:10.540
It is the most beautiful book
of magic I have ever read.

26:19.020 --> 26:21.220
I will fetch some pears.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.130
It requires a spell.

26:24.180 --> 26:27.090
What about Drake's Restoration
of Flown Tranquillity?

26:27.140 --> 26:30.450
No. Chauntlucet, perhaps. Or
Martin Pale's Rectification...

26:30.500 --> 26:34.690
Come along, gents! We must
know something to the point.

26:34.740 --> 26:37.730
We are all magicians and
England is full of magic.

26:37.780 --> 26:40.380
I do know one spell that might.

26:41.740 --> 26:44.480
~ Do the magic.
~ Wait here a moment.

26:45.260 --> 26:47.850
I suggest we go to Hurtfew
and seek out Mr Strange.

26:47.900 --> 26:51.370
~ No, that is just what we must not do.
~ And why is that, sir?

26:51.420 --> 26:53.610
Strange wishes my wife
to remain bound.

26:53.660 --> 26:56.980
He instructs her to stay there.
This is why she's sleeps.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.340
A spell to join together
two articles...

27:10.700 --> 27:13.800
~ .. which have parted.
~ I have been wrong.

27:14.740 --> 27:17.010
This was not meant to be.

27:22.300 --> 27:25.130
Mr Strange tells Lady Pole to wait.

27:25.180 --> 27:29.010
Why? You know the
enchanter, Mr Black.

27:29.060 --> 27:33.050
The man with the answers,
he is hanged.

27:33.100 --> 27:34.490
Which man?

27:34.540 --> 27:37.900
He was the book of the Raven King.

27:39.860 --> 27:41.570
He said...

27:41.620 --> 27:44.780
my fortune was written on his body.

27:45.740 --> 27:48.980
~ And the fortune of your masters.
~ Vinculus.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.850
I helped hang him.

27:52.900 --> 27:55.130
~ Where did you hang him?
~ Huh?

27:55.180 --> 27:57.170
WHERE did you hang him?

27:57.220 --> 27:59.650
In a ravine, not far from here.

27:59.700 --> 28:02.700
I have had this spell
for a long time.

28:02.820 --> 28:04.130
Sir.

28:04.180 --> 28:05.540
Sir!

28:07.500 --> 28:09.490
You must not let them do the magic.

28:09.540 --> 28:12.170
~ What?
~ He will punish them.

28:12.220 --> 28:14.160
Mr Segundus, wait.

28:16.180 --> 28:17.980
Stop! Stop!

28:33.900 --> 28:36.370
They have stolen her from me.

28:37.220 --> 28:39.700
Thieves! English thieves!

28:40.780 --> 28:42.700
Stephen!

28:46.340 --> 28:48.100
Ugh!

28:53.220 --> 28:56.530
Why have you brought me back?
I was supposed to stay.

28:56.580 --> 28:59.290
I was to show Mrs Strange
the safe path out.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.970
~ My darling. Oh, my darling...
~ No. Not yours.

29:02.020 --> 29:04.570
~ What?
~ I was sold.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.890
Bargained away for the sake
of a wicked man's career.

29:06.940 --> 29:08.650
What are you saying?

29:08.700 --> 29:10.170
My own...

29:11.340 --> 29:13.610
Mrs Strange will be lost.

29:22.940 --> 29:25.130
Lady Pole is gone.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.980
It is too soon.

29:27.980 --> 29:30.930
~ You told me Childermass had my letter.
~ No, I said he had a box.

29:30.980 --> 29:33.890
~ I do not know anything about a letter.
~ We must do the magic now!

29:33.940 --> 29:36.090
Sir, what happened?

29:36.140 --> 29:38.370
I'm off, Mr Black. I have
to find a hanged man.

29:38.420 --> 29:40.130
Please set me free!

29:40.180 --> 29:41.610
Open this door!

29:41.660 --> 29:44.930
~ Open this door and let me out!
~ Why does he not despair, Stephen?

29:44.980 --> 29:49.820
Why does he not just fail
as he is meant to and die?

29:54.340 --> 29:59.100
Stephen, what are you
doing in that tiny room?

30:03.340 --> 30:05.080
Are you ready?

30:06.580 --> 30:08.370
Your hands are shaking.

30:08.420 --> 30:10.760
It is because I am afraid.

30:12.940 --> 30:17.640
My hands trembled like that in
the Peninsula and after Waterloo.

30:18.700 --> 30:21.800
Sometimes it was a sign
that I was afraid.

30:23.260 --> 30:26.660
Sometimes a sign that
I was doing great magic.

30:27.820 --> 30:30.220
The two things go together.

30:46.020 --> 30:49.180
Mr Strange, you have been in
the darkness longer than I.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.500
You will die first.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.290
If we should fail in this,

30:55.340 --> 30:58.290
then I will continue
trying to free your wife

30:58.340 --> 31:01.440
with all my power for
as long as I live.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.770
'I do not believe we
are destined to fail.

31:05.820 --> 31:08.820
'This is the magic
we were born to do.'

31:09.220 --> 31:11.960
'They have locked you in, Stephen.

31:13.420 --> 31:14.970
'They have bound you fast.'

31:15.020 --> 31:18.210
We must go and kill them all.

31:18.260 --> 31:23.010
It is rare that anyone released
from an enchantment is permitted

31:23.060 --> 31:25.770
to live long,

31:25.820 --> 31:28.690
not if I have enchanted them.

31:28.740 --> 31:30.480
Come, Stephen!

31:31.620 --> 31:35.720
Let the Abbey stones be the
envoy sent to seek the King.

31:36.860 --> 31:40.970
Let the Hurtfew beck be the path
by which the King shall come.

31:41.020 --> 31:43.170
Let the fruit from the orchard trees

31:43.220 --> 31:46.090
be the handsel the King will receive.

31:46.740 --> 31:48.890
'And let the moment
of this flame's death

31:48.940 --> 31:51.810
'be the time the King shall appear.'

32:29.780 --> 32:33.180
Where has he gone? Damn
it, where has he gone?

32:46.140 --> 32:48.210
This is my body, sir.

32:54.460 --> 32:56.650
You have been warned, sir.

32:56.700 --> 32:58.840
Let him be. Let him...

32:59.700 --> 33:01.330
'We must summon him back! Quickly!'

33:01.380 --> 33:04.530
Kings do not do as other men. He
has come, he saw us and he's gone.

33:04.580 --> 33:07.210
Well, do not just stand there.
What is his fairy name?

33:07.260 --> 33:10.410
~ That is lost.
~ What about that other thing
you mentioned, the nameless...

33:10.460 --> 33:13.210
~ The Nameless Slave.
~ That is what he calls
himself in the prophecy.

33:13.260 --> 33:15.610
Let us try that. The Black
King. The King in the North.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.160
~ The Nameless Slave.
~ That is extremely imprecise.

33:57.180 --> 34:00.180
You were hanged, sir.
You were hanged!

34:04.580 --> 34:06.450
I've changed.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.170
I've changed.

34:10.980 --> 34:13.210
I do not say what I said before.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.929
What do you say now?

34:14.980 --> 34:16.770
I don't know -

34:16.820 --> 34:19.290
books cannot read themselves.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.020
Come on.

34:23.219 --> 34:26.260
I must bring you to
my masters. Come on.

34:34.420 --> 34:37.980
~ What gift will you offer him?
~ I will return his magic to him.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.889
The magic of England's trees,
hills, her sunlight,

34:42.940 --> 34:45.340
her water, earth and stones.

34:46.340 --> 34:49.330
Stephen!

34:49.380 --> 34:51.090
Come!

34:51.139 --> 34:54.770
Sir! I beg you, please.
Do not harm her Ladyship.

34:54.820 --> 34:58.690
My dear, beautiful, indifferent Lady.

34:58.740 --> 35:00.770
~ Stand behind me, Emma.
~ I will do no such thing.

35:00.820 --> 35:05.530
I have in mind for you
a fate so exquisite.

35:05.580 --> 35:09.090
I have had my fill of you gentlemen
taking what you want of me.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.330
Sir, I beg you. Please do not.

35:10.380 --> 35:13.850
But I have my voice now and
I say you are a bore, sir.

35:13.900 --> 35:17.490
An uncivilised, unsightly,
filthy bore,

35:17.540 --> 35:19.850
with your tasteless clothes

35:19.900 --> 35:23.020
and with your hair like thistledown.

35:24.220 --> 35:26.340
"Thistledown"?

35:27.620 --> 35:30.900
~ Sir, perhaps if you would...
~ What on earth is it, Stephen?

35:41.780 --> 35:45.580
Why are you firing walnuts at me?

35:46.660 --> 35:48.170
'You need to give him a token.'

35:48.220 --> 35:51.450
A proper physical artefact
to signify the gift.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.090
And what token could possibly signify

35:53.140 --> 35:56.340
that you will give him
all of English magic?

35:59.660 --> 36:00.800
No.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.650
No, not my books.

36:05.260 --> 36:07.090
No, no, he cannot have my books.

36:07.140 --> 36:09.850
I am not about to stand here and
summon the most powerful magician

36:09.900 --> 36:11.770
who has ever lived and
say to him, "I offer you

36:11.820 --> 36:13.410
"all of English magic, apart from,

36:13.460 --> 36:16.460
"I am sorry, Gilbert
Norrell's books."

36:17.700 --> 36:19.370
~ Half of them.
~ Mr Norrell!

36:19.420 --> 36:22.620
We will both soon be dead. There
will be no leisure for reading.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.680
Two-thirds.

36:39.940 --> 36:43.890
This lady is under our protection.

36:43.940 --> 36:47.410
Return to your Other
Lands, fairy, and...

36:55.740 --> 36:57.850
Argh!

36:59.860 --> 37:01.060
Agh!

37:06.340 --> 37:07.930
Release them!

37:07.980 --> 37:10.810
If you lay one hand on
her, I swear I will...

37:10.860 --> 37:13.300
You have not the right, sir.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.850
For years, you have been quite
happy to see your beloved

37:17.900 --> 37:19.370
endure her trial.

37:19.420 --> 37:21.820
I have been no such thing...

37:23.260 --> 37:25.410
~ Walter!
~ Argh!

37:25.460 --> 37:31.660
You have sold her and blinded
yourself to the consequence.

37:33.780 --> 37:35.740
Argh! Argh!

37:37.540 --> 37:41.770
I command the magic of
England's stones, trees,

37:41.820 --> 37:44.160
wind and water to rise up.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.730
Release them. Release them!

37:49.500 --> 37:52.180
Re...

37:58.220 --> 38:00.360
Now you may kill them.

38:01.620 --> 38:03.850
He has despised you.

38:03.900 --> 38:08.050
He took your name. And she has
treated you like a servant.

38:09.900 --> 38:12.020
No, sir! No!

38:13.420 --> 38:14.770
'I command all of English magic'

38:14.820 --> 38:17.250
to put itself into the
hands of the Black King.

38:17.300 --> 38:20.170
The King in the North.
The Nameless Slave!

38:20.220 --> 38:22.210
He has made you a slave.

38:22.260 --> 38:26.530
He has made me as much
a slave as you have.

38:26.580 --> 38:30.570
I command them to bring
him here and bind him

38:30.620 --> 38:32.970
to kill the Master of Lost-Hope.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.450
Kill him. Kill him!

39:11.860 --> 39:13.400
My library.

39:16.780 --> 39:18.250
My books.

39:47.140 --> 39:49.290
That is not the Raven King.

39:49.340 --> 39:52.090
Mr Strange. Mr Norrell.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.810
That is Sir Walter Pole's butler.

40:10.180 --> 40:12.050
Come, Mr Norrell.

40:13.820 --> 40:16.330
I have but one shot,
and I mean to use it.

40:16.380 --> 40:18.930
Mr Lascelles, come here.

40:18.980 --> 40:21.090
Come here by my side.

40:21.140 --> 40:23.340
I will do no such thing.

40:24.260 --> 40:25.650
What have...

40:25.700 --> 40:28.060
you... done?

41:02.820 --> 41:04.360
Stephen...

41:12.060 --> 41:13.660
~ Argh!
~ Argh!

41:17.620 --> 41:19.730
What have they done to you,

41:19.780 --> 41:23.650
my beautiful, gracious Stephen.

41:31.900 --> 41:33.170
We...

41:34.180 --> 41:37.250
We have channelled
all of English magic

41:37.300 --> 41:39.100
into a butler...

41:40.060 --> 41:42.060
.. and he shot him!

41:43.140 --> 41:45.980
Stephen, the most noble soul

41:47.540 --> 41:49.530
in the whole world.

41:49.580 --> 41:51.690
He's gone from us

41:51.740 --> 41:55.050
and the world shall be PUNISHED!

41:55.100 --> 41:57.180
Mr Strange.

41:58.380 --> 42:00.290
Mr Strange!

42:00.340 --> 42:02.480
Oh, please no. Please.

42:05.300 --> 42:08.170
We have failed.

42:08.220 --> 42:10.020
We have failed.

42:11.140 --> 42:13.850
I was told we should fail,
I did not believe it.

42:13.900 --> 42:17.370
The butler still has all
of English magic inside him.

42:17.420 --> 42:19.970
There may be something we can do.

42:20.020 --> 42:22.370
If we can find him before
he takes his last breath,

42:22.420 --> 42:26.130
~ we can instruct him.
But we must find him now.
~ They have gone to Lost-Hope.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.530
I cannot follow him there
by the King's Roads.

42:31.580 --> 42:34.120
The fairy has closed the path.

42:34.460 --> 42:36.260
But not from me.

42:37.020 --> 42:40.220
And mirrors are not the
only way to travel.

42:59.220 --> 43:02.330
The rain shall make a door for me...

43:02.380 --> 43:04.850
.. and I shall go through it.

43:06.020 --> 43:09.120
We are not done with
this yet, Mr Strange.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.960
We are not done with this yet!

43:21.860 --> 43:23.490
This...

43:23.540 --> 43:25.340
This is Faerie.

43:27.820 --> 43:29.930
Oh, it worked!

43:29.980 --> 43:32.930
Oh! Why I have not done this before?

43:32.980 --> 43:35.730
There are plenty uses for rain.

43:35.780 --> 43:39.370
There is nothing wrong
with good English rain!

43:39.420 --> 43:42.730
And the Black Tower has
not followed us here!

43:42.780 --> 43:44.770
Fairy magic is seductive, Mr Strange.

43:44.820 --> 43:46.970
Because by its very nature
it is instinctual,

43:47.020 --> 43:49.250
impulsive and unpremeditated.

43:49.300 --> 43:52.010
But the creature uses allegiances
with the forces of nature

43:52.060 --> 43:54.770
within the Christian world,
our world, not his.

43:54.820 --> 43:58.340
Ergo, his curse will
not affect us here.

44:05.980 --> 44:07.720
I am not dead.

44:10.620 --> 44:12.360
Oh, Stephen...

44:13.180 --> 44:17.490
.. you are full of magic.

44:17.540 --> 44:18.930
This recalls me to my youth.

44:18.980 --> 44:22.250
Oh, I once pictured myself a dashing
magician travelling to Faerie...

44:22.300 --> 44:25.260
Come, Mr Norrell, we have work to do.

44:35.500 --> 44:37.300
My wife is here.

44:38.260 --> 44:39.770
She is enchanted.

44:39.820 --> 44:42.530
Mr Strange, spells of perception
were covered in the study plan,

44:42.580 --> 44:45.170
disenchantment is in Sutton Grove.

44:45.220 --> 44:48.620
Go, do your magic. I will
look for the butler.

45:04.900 --> 45:08.780
I feel power.

45:10.900 --> 45:12.610
Power.

45:12.660 --> 45:15.660
It is the power of
English magic, sir!

45:17.140 --> 45:20.220
Use it to destroy this beast!

45:22.380 --> 45:23.580
You.

45:28.580 --> 45:30.450
No...

45:30.500 --> 45:34.460
It is foretold that
I should become king.

45:37.460 --> 45:40.610
Yes. We shall be kings together.

45:40.660 --> 45:44.850
You in England, I in Lost-Hope.

45:44.900 --> 45:48.370
It is destined that I should kill
the king and take his place.

45:48.420 --> 45:51.650
And now I see that you are that king.

45:51.700 --> 45:54.730
Oh, Stephen...

45:54.780 --> 45:56.940
Bell. Arabella!

45:58.940 --> 46:00.210
No more.

46:00.260 --> 46:05.410
I command THE WIND!

46:06.900 --> 46:09.820
Arabella. Bell!

46:13.020 --> 46:14.090
Who are you?

46:14.140 --> 46:16.850
I command the stones!

46:18.060 --> 46:20.420
~ Stephen, no!
~ Remember me.

46:22.180 --> 46:25.530
You are destroying
my beautiful house!

46:34.180 --> 46:35.730
Jonathan!

46:35.780 --> 46:38.620
Jonathan Strange!

46:40.060 --> 46:43.060
~ There you are, my love.
~ Jonathan Strange!

46:45.620 --> 46:47.960
I am very glad to see you!

46:48.980 --> 46:51.580
I feel like I've just woken up.

46:52.420 --> 46:54.530
And yet I still seem to be dreaming.

46:54.580 --> 46:58.770
I command the trees!

47:03.060 --> 47:04.130
Come, come.

47:04.180 --> 47:06.330
Touch this mirror and think of home.

47:06.380 --> 47:08.010
I will follow after you directly.

47:08.060 --> 47:10.770
No, no, no. I want
to wait here with you!

47:10.820 --> 47:13.360
No, you must go. Please, Bell!

47:14.660 --> 47:18.490
Argh!

47:18.540 --> 47:22.050
Trust me, Bell. It is a
path made for you alone.

47:22.100 --> 47:25.500
It will lead you to my
friends. I will follow.

47:29.060 --> 47:31.460
Do you promise me, Jonathan?

47:33.580 --> 47:35.650
No, no. No, Jonathan!

47:48.500 --> 47:51.330
~ Is this Faerie?
~ No, madam.

47:51.380 --> 47:53.330
Is it England?

47:53.380 --> 47:54.970
It is Venice.

47:55.020 --> 47:56.290
Is Jonathan here?

47:56.340 --> 47:59.780
~ You are Mrs Strange.
~ Please tell me that Jonathan's here.

48:01.060 --> 48:06.010
This is a house of depraved cruelty!

48:06.060 --> 48:08.410
Mr Black, let us help you!

48:08.460 --> 48:10.170
Go!

48:16.340 --> 48:18.290
Stephen, no!

48:18.340 --> 48:22.610
I can tell you your true name!

48:22.660 --> 48:24.930
I am The Nameless Slave

48:24.980 --> 48:27.930
and I answer to no master now!

48:27.980 --> 48:29.650
Argh!

49:00.100 --> 49:03.370
She is in Italy! She is in Italy.

49:03.420 --> 49:08.180
Well, Mr Strange, no English magician
has ever killed a fairy.

49:09.820 --> 49:13.020
I am not at all sure how
we did it, but it is done.

49:14.900 --> 49:16.970
I must go to my wife.

49:23.580 --> 49:27.460
England is full of magic
and it should be used.

49:29.860 --> 49:32.570
You are a great magician, Mr Norrell.

49:32.620 --> 49:34.760
And you are my friend.

49:37.340 --> 49:39.010
Goodbye, sir.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.780
Goodbye.

49:44.980 --> 49:46.260
Ugh!

49:56.660 --> 49:59.960
~ We are trapped!
~ We are still in the Darkness!

50:00.580 --> 50:04.370
~ He is dead. His spell cannot outlive him!
~ I do not know.
~ Can it?

50:04.420 --> 50:07.610
~ We know so little about
this magic. We are...
~ I cannot die here.

50:07.660 --> 50:09.460
We are but men.

50:18.580 --> 50:20.570
Mr Strange.

50:20.620 --> 50:23.090
I've been under this
spell for too long.

50:23.140 --> 50:24.700
Mr Strange.

50:28.340 --> 50:29.820
Jonathan.

50:32.100 --> 50:33.640
Jonathan...

50:35.100 --> 50:36.770
.. my friend.

50:39.020 --> 50:41.090
I will not leave you, Jonathan.

50:41.140 --> 50:43.010
Do not be afraid.

50:45.100 --> 50:46.640
Look at me.

50:48.540 --> 50:49.980
See...

50:51.500 --> 50:53.380
I am not afraid.

50:55.300 --> 50:57.100
I am not afraid.

51:12.660 --> 51:14.460
We are too late.

51:15.020 --> 51:17.020
They've gone.

51:18.700 --> 51:22.100
Do you still not understand,
John Childermass?

51:22.340 --> 51:24.340
They are the spell.

51:25.740 --> 51:28.250
They are the spell the
Raven King has spun

51:28.300 --> 51:31.250
and that is all they have ever been.

51:31.300 --> 51:33.440
He is spinning it now.

51:54.380 --> 51:57.130
Wellington's the man, they say.

51:57.180 --> 51:59.050
To be Prime Minister.

51:59.100 --> 52:02.800
He has the taint of magic
on him to be sure, but...

52:04.500 --> 52:07.580
Tell me, do you still enjoy dancing?

52:08.700 --> 52:13.000
I am going to the Continent,
Sir Walter, to help my friend.

52:13.060 --> 52:15.860
I do not intend to live here again.

52:17.340 --> 52:21.340
I will not go from one kind
of helplessness to another.

52:34.100 --> 52:36.930
There is no more news from England?

52:36.980 --> 52:39.780
No. I'm afraid he has not returned.

52:41.620 --> 52:45.420
He was so desperately in
love with you, Mrs Strange.

52:47.820 --> 52:49.360
It is here.

52:53.060 --> 52:55.730
They believe it is still cursed.

53:18.740 --> 53:20.210
Arabella.

53:22.020 --> 53:23.170
Bella.

53:23.220 --> 53:24.580
Here...

53:33.500 --> 53:34.900
My love.

53:36.700 --> 53:38.050
Bella.

53:38.100 --> 53:40.530
Jonathan!

53:40.580 --> 53:43.580
I'm very pleased to
see you, Arabella.

53:43.820 --> 53:46.020
I thought you were dead.

53:47.340 --> 53:50.080
Oh, my love. What happened to you?

53:51.020 --> 53:54.010
~ I am just a reflection.
~ What?

53:54.060 --> 53:55.850
I'm sorry, I cannot stay long.

53:55.900 --> 53:58.130
Why? I don't understand?

53:58.180 --> 54:01.820
~ What... And where are you?
~ I'm not entirely sure.

54:03.220 --> 54:06.020
I'm not entirely sure I'm anywhere.

54:07.900 --> 54:10.100
You look well, Arabella.

54:12.020 --> 54:14.220
I'm miserable, Jonathan.

54:14.740 --> 54:16.740
Do not be miserable.

54:18.020 --> 54:19.820
I do not suffer.

54:22.820 --> 54:26.410
I am happy that I have seen
you back to yourself again.

54:26.460 --> 54:30.020
It hurt me more than I could bear
to think of you under the earth.

54:31.580 --> 54:35.280
I would have done anything
to fetch you safely out.

54:35.700 --> 54:37.500
And you did it.

54:38.140 --> 54:39.680
You did it.

54:40.500 --> 54:43.860
And one day, you will find the right
spell and you will come back to me.

54:45.500 --> 54:47.500
Yes, one day.

54:50.180 --> 54:51.890
I will wait.

54:51.940 --> 54:53.880
Bell, do not wait.

54:55.460 --> 54:57.400
Do not be a widow.

54:58.180 --> 54:59.820
Be happy.

55:02.420 --> 55:05.520
Remember the happiness
before the magic.

55:08.940 --> 55:10.940
Jonathan. Jonathan.

55:12.100 --> 55:14.730
If you do not return,
so help me, Jonathan,

55:14.780 --> 55:18.660
I will come, and I will find you
and I will bring you back myself!

55:19.860 --> 55:21.580
My wife.

55:23.460 --> 55:25.220
My love.

55:30.180 --> 55:31.690
Goodbye.

55:31.740 --> 55:33.940
No, Jonathan. Jonathan!

55:52.300 --> 55:55.090
'Some years ago, there
was, in the city of York,

55:55.140 --> 55:57.340
'a society of magicians.

55:57.660 --> 56:00.730
'Some of them were
gentleman magicians.

56:00.780 --> 56:02.890
'But only some of them.

56:02.940 --> 56:07.290
'For things were not quite as they
were before magic came back.'

56:07.340 --> 56:10.130
~ Strange's book was full of black magic...
~ It was his daughter...

56:10.180 --> 56:12.250
Mr Tantony and I met Mr Strange,

56:12.300 --> 56:14.130
and he's a book thief and a murderer.

56:14.180 --> 56:16.250
He certainly murdered his wife,

56:16.300 --> 56:19.460
~ and probably Mr Norrell, too.
~ Gentleman!

56:28.420 --> 56:30.490
Some of you may remember me.

56:30.540 --> 56:32.770
I was here some years ago

56:32.820 --> 56:36.050
when Mr Norrell did the
magic at the Minster.

56:36.100 --> 56:37.890
My name is John Childermass.

56:37.940 --> 56:42.040
I was, until last month, the
servant of Gilbert Norrell.

56:42.860 --> 56:45.370
I have summoned you here
to tell you your agreement

56:45.420 --> 56:47.820
with my old master is void.

56:49.060 --> 56:52.090
You are magicians once
more if you wish to be.

56:52.140 --> 56:55.130
For whatever good it will do you.

56:55.180 --> 56:57.890
~ Is Mr Strange coming?
~ And what about Mr Norrell?

56:57.940 --> 57:00.210
You must make do with me.

57:00.540 --> 57:02.540
Where are the books?

57:04.180 --> 57:07.170
All the books of magic in
England have gone with them.

57:07.220 --> 57:09.020
Except for one.

57:10.300 --> 57:12.930
This is a book Norrell long
desired and never saw.

57:12.980 --> 57:16.010
A book Strange did
not even know existed.

57:16.060 --> 57:18.460
It is the Raven King's book.

57:19.340 --> 57:22.450
It held their fates
once and it may still.

57:22.500 --> 57:26.340
It is my hope that we may decipher
its meaning together.

57:27.820 --> 57:29.420
.. Vinculus?

57:32.260 --> 57:34.570
He was a prophecy before.

57:34.620 --> 57:37.770
The things he has foretold have come
to pass just as they were ordained

57:37.820 --> 57:40.170
by the Raven King himself

57:40.220 --> 57:43.170
and now, his words have changed.

57:43.220 --> 57:46.410
~ What are you now, sir?
~ I don't know.

57:46.460 --> 57:48.660
Maybe I'm a recipe book.

57:49.460 --> 57:52.260
Or a collection of pompous sermons.

57:53.820 --> 57:56.540
Or perhaps, I am a novel.

57:57.620 --> 58:00.620
I hope you are what
you always have been.

58:01.260 --> 58:03.450
The key to our future,

58:03.500 --> 58:05.440
maybe even theirs.

58:06.700 --> 58:09.440
Where have they gone, Childermass?

58:10.340 --> 58:13.010
Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell.

58:14.580 --> 58:16.320
I do not know.

58:17.260 --> 58:20.260
Wherever magicians
used to go perhaps.

58:21.060 --> 58:22.860
Beyond the sky.

58:23.620 --> 58:25.300
On the other side of the rain.
