00:28.445 --> 00:30.071
Mrs. Helmstetter?

00:32.991 --> 00:34.409
Hello.

00:35.326 --> 00:39.622
I'm Shrunken Apple.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.499
I'm so thirsty.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.377
It's important for me to be hydrated.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.547
No, please! Just-- Just go away!

00:49.007 --> 00:51.009
What is wrong with you?

00:52.385 --> 00:57.891
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to make these things?!

00:57.974 --> 00:58.808
Louise.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.061
Can I see you in my office?

01:07.817 --> 01:09.778
Louise, let me be crystal clear.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.614
I have a soft spot in my heart

01:12.697 --> 01:15.700
for a fidgety, faded,
alcoholic flapper like yourself.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.496
Which is why I gave you a job
as a candy striper,

01:19.579 --> 01:22.165
because I felt your life could use
a little direction.

01:23.291 --> 01:29.255
But I will not tolerate you terrorizing
patients who are already fragile.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.215
So...

01:30.715 --> 01:33.551
if they don't want your craft therapy,

01:33.635 --> 01:36.304
you just say, "Have a nice day,"
and move on.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.557
Uh... Understood.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.600
Okay.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.519
Roger that.

01:47.941 --> 01:52.028
It's just that I'm <i>so</i> enthusiastic
about being <i>here.</i>

01:53.279 --> 01:57.117
Finally, I got something more
than just a <i>job.</i>

01:58.284 --> 01:59.536
I have a career.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.289
I just can't thank you enough.

02:03.706 --> 02:04.666
Okay.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.671
I almost forgot.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.843
Your newspaper.

02:19.597 --> 02:20.598
Look at that.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.312
Oh.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.231
Yes, I heard.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.697
The governor is hell-bent on reelection,

02:36.614 --> 02:39.534
so he is rushing that through the system.

02:39.617 --> 02:43.246
Now, it's a smart move, probably
get his campaign across the line.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.374
If you ask me,
it is an absolute disgrace.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.460
But, come election day...

02:52.463 --> 02:54.132
I think Tolleson will be dead.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.272
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.233
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:06.806 --> 05:07.765
-Hey.
-Hi.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.768
I didn't see you there.

05:14.022 --> 05:14.856
I had to...

05:19.027 --> 05:20.778
I'd like to keep going but...

05:22.405 --> 05:24.282
I think I'm gonna need an intermission.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.547
I know...

05:40.631 --> 05:42.717
the chemotherapy's just started...

05:44.177 --> 05:46.763
but I can't believe
how awful I feel already.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.141
What?

05:52.685 --> 05:53.811
You have a plan...

05:55.480 --> 05:57.940
rattling around
in that brilliant little head of yours.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.196
I felt I couldn't talk about it

06:03.279 --> 06:05.948
until I knew what was going to happen
with Edmund.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.534
And now...

06:12.872 --> 06:14.415
Now that that's settled...

06:17.126 --> 06:18.711
this chapter of my life...

06:19.712 --> 06:20.963
will have come to an end.

06:21.839 --> 06:24.217
And you and I can just pack our bags.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.762
We'll... drive south.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.767
Along the coastline,
all the way to Mexico.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.185
Mexico?

06:35.561 --> 06:36.479
Oh.

06:37.605 --> 06:38.898
Oh, that'd be nice.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.446
<i>And when the time comes...</i>

06:45.988 --> 06:47.490
<i>we'd be sitting on a balcony...</i>

06:48.157 --> 06:50.118
<i>a hacienda on the beach.</i>

06:51.160 --> 06:52.745
<i>Margaritas in hand.</i>

06:55.206 --> 06:56.666
<i>And I could just slip away...</i>

06:58.835 --> 07:00.545
<i>While the sun sets over the ocean.</i>

07:07.510 --> 07:08.344
<i>And that...</i>

07:09.303 --> 07:10.221
<i>will be the end...</i>

07:11.514 --> 07:13.683
<i>of a particularly beautiful chapter...</i>

07:15.351 --> 07:17.812
in what I know is going to be the long...

07:19.021 --> 07:21.274
and thrilling life of Mildred Ratched.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.324
Don't talk like that.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.452
I mean it.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.455
This has been the most...

07:38.332 --> 07:39.208
astonishing...

07:41.419 --> 07:42.503
luminous month...

07:45.923 --> 07:46.757
of my life.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.517
Now you listen to me.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.769
I've done some research.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.981
I've heard about some brilliant doctors

08:02.064 --> 08:04.817
who are having the most
extraordinary results

08:04.901 --> 08:08.154
putting terminally ill cancer patients
into remission,

08:08.529 --> 08:09.906
and they're in Mexico.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.075
We can cure you, Gwendolyn.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.954
Both of us will be getting on
with our lives...

08:18.080 --> 08:18.956
together.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.125
Oh, Mildred.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.337
Mildred.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.047
Oh.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.387
That does sound like heaven.

08:33.888 --> 08:34.722
Doesn't it?

09:00.873 --> 09:03.000
<i>You've done a great job here, Betsy.</i>

09:03.084 --> 09:05.378
<i>The hospital seems to be</i>
<i>running quite smoothly.</i>

09:05.461 --> 09:09.257
I must say that the way
Dr. Hanover ran things...

09:10.174 --> 09:11.634
set a rather low bar.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.843
-Mm.

09:12.927 --> 09:13.844
Oh.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.931
I've hired a woman doctor.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.224
Isn't that incredible?

09:22.937 --> 09:24.981
I know you're here about your brother.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.695
You probably want me to talk you through
what it's going to be like for him...

09:31.571 --> 09:32.530
the execution?

09:34.865 --> 09:35.950
Yes.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.959
<i>He'll be brought down a long</i>
<i>hallway to the execution chamber.</i>

09:49.088 --> 09:50.673
<i>He'll be strapped to a gurney,</i>

09:50.756 --> 09:53.217
and an IV will be inserted into his arm...

09:54.927 --> 09:57.763
<i>as well as a backup</i>
<i>in case the first line fails.</i>

09:58.222 --> 10:01.434
-<i>He'll be given his last rites.</i>

10:02.727 --> 10:04.854
<i>In his case, by a priest.</i>

10:05.563 --> 10:06.564
It's ironic.

10:13.070 --> 10:17.533
<i>At this point, Edmund will be asked</i>
<i>if he has any last words.</i>

10:17.908 --> 10:19.035
I'd just like to say...

10:20.494 --> 10:22.622
...I'm sorry for what I did.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.292
I hope that my death
can provide you some comfort.

10:32.673 --> 10:36.927
An injection of sodium thiopental
will render him unconscious

10:37.011 --> 10:38.346
<i>in a matter of seconds.</i>

10:42.183 --> 10:44.810
The second injection
is potassium chloride...

10:46.103 --> 10:47.647
which will stop his heart.

10:48.939 --> 10:51.734
<i>Usually, within a few minutes.</i>

11:20.471 --> 11:21.806
Mildred, you have done...

11:22.682 --> 11:24.684
everything you could for him.

11:25.017 --> 11:29.355
What's important to remember is
that he has two more weeks left here,

11:29.438 --> 11:34.777
and I want to make sure that his last days
have a semblance of dignity about them.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.321
Dr. Hanover's barn is finished.

11:37.905 --> 11:42.243
So I want to make sure
he spends an hour a day in there

11:42.326 --> 11:43.953
to do a little work,

11:44.036 --> 11:45.705
commune with the animals.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.586
Why?

11:58.175 --> 12:00.678
I'm so very, very sorry.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.139
I'm here for you, Mildred.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.057
I'm here for both of you.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.772
It's a lovely day, isn't it, Mr. Tolleson?

12:12.815 --> 12:15.526
These fatheads won't let me soap anymore
when I shower.

12:15.609 --> 12:16.527
Mmm.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.071
Hygiene is the least of your problems.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.575
As you know, in two weeks,
you will be executed.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.578
And despite your ghastly crimes,

12:25.661 --> 12:30.040
you are a human being who must not spend
the entirety of his final days

12:30.124 --> 12:33.836
confined to a cold, dark, sodden cell.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.132
And as a Christian,
I believe it is my duty

12:38.215 --> 12:42.386
to give you every final chance
to make peace with God

12:42.470 --> 12:46.223
and His beautiful Earth
that you took for granted.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.351
Which is why every day,

12:49.810 --> 12:51.979
I will allow you to come out
into the sunshine

12:52.062 --> 12:54.940
and the fresh air and connect with nature.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.069
-Did Mildred put you up to this?

12:59.153 --> 13:01.322
Today you will spend time in the barn.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.117
This barn was Dr. Hanover's dream.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.828
He often talked about the ancient Greeks,

13:07.912 --> 13:12.249
who were the first to use animals
to lift the spirits of the seriously ill.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.543
And he spoke of horses,

13:14.627 --> 13:17.838
believing that they could tell
a man's true character

13:17.922 --> 13:19.632
from one interaction.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.009
-Gentlemen, if you please.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.726
You have one hour.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.453
Any issue, and we've been
authorized to shoot you dead.

13:51.288 --> 13:52.331
Easy, fellas.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.709
I'm not after no trouble today.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.181
Oh, look at that.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.225
Oh.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.479
You take good care of that egg.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.439
That's your egg.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.651
Whatever you do,
don't let them take it away from you.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.252
They ought to call you Porky.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.007
Hi, Porky.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.386
You're a sweetheart.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.764
Hm.

14:57.813 --> 14:58.647
Wow.

15:01.108 --> 15:01.942
Hello.

15:05.946 --> 15:06.822
Hi.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.534
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.370
Look at me.

15:13.996 --> 15:14.955
You see me?

15:17.333 --> 15:18.334
I'm not afraid.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.546
I'm not afraid.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.428
I'm not afraid.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.687
I'm not afraid.

16:09.885 --> 16:10.844
Case Hitchen.

16:10.928 --> 16:15.057
You got any last words for the relatives
of little Jimmy Stratton?

16:15.140 --> 16:16.058
Uh...

16:17.518 --> 16:18.519
Yeah, I-- I do.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.439
I'm real sorry for what I done--

16:22.523 --> 16:24.233
Thank you, Mr. Hitchen,
that was very moving.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.610
Can you just, uh,
turn him around for me there?

16:27.528 --> 16:28.862
Son...

16:30.698 --> 16:32.074
My name is George Wilburn,

16:32.157 --> 16:34.493
I'm the governor
of the great state of California.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.787
And I want to tell you,
when I was informed

16:36.870 --> 16:38.831
that you were facing death
by lethal injection

16:38.914 --> 16:42.001
for killing that seven-year-old boy,
I said to myself, "Well...

16:43.043 --> 16:44.294
he doesn't deserve that."

16:46.755 --> 16:47.965
That you deserve this.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.802
You know what they used to call
this old contraption?

16:51.885 --> 16:53.345
-Big Sparky.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.015
They put him away for awhile,

16:56.098 --> 16:58.642
but it's time we brought him out,
put him back to work. Now look,

16:58.726 --> 17:00.227
you can blubber all you want,

17:00.310 --> 17:03.147
like that little boy did
when you slit his throat from ear to ear.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.483
Or you can sit in the chair, be a man,
and get what's coming to you.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.487
Mr. Hitchen is now taking his seat
in the chair.

17:10.821 --> 17:11.655
Atta boy.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.408
Looks like the governor is going
to address the family of the victim.

17:14.491 --> 17:18.537
Ladies and gentlemen, friends and family
of that dear little boy, Jimmy Stratton...

17:20.581 --> 17:21.415
I...

17:23.000 --> 17:24.043
I want you to know...

17:24.877 --> 17:25.836
I share your pain.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.005
<i>As long as I am governor,</i>

17:28.088 --> 17:31.967
<i>the state of California will be</i>
<i>a place of law and order.</i>

17:32.468 --> 17:33.677
You're gonna want to hear this.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.889
<i>Every law-abiding citizen will be able</i>
<i>to sleep soundly at night</i>

17:36.972 --> 17:39.475
<i>knowing that their elected officials</i>
<i>protect their family</i>

17:39.558 --> 17:41.602
<i>from bloodthirsty criminals.</i>

17:41.685 --> 17:44.313
-And we'll do everything in our power...

17:45.105 --> 17:46.857
to make good on that promise.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.068
-Thank you.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.362
Warden, hold on a second,
may I do the honors?

17:54.239 --> 17:58.243
And now it looks like the governor
is going to throw the switch himself.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.495
Well, son.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.914
May God have mercy on you...

18:03.916 --> 18:05.167
because I ain't gonna.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.217
The governor has thrown the switch.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.469
<i>The prisoner is...</i>

18:16.053 --> 18:16.929
<i>Lord help us.</i>

18:19.389 --> 18:20.390
Why didn't they...

18:20.474 --> 18:21.600
Something is wrong.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.561
<i>Something is terribly wrong, this is...</i>

18:24.645 --> 18:26.647
<i>This is simply beyond description.</i>

18:32.111 --> 18:33.987
Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down, calm down.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.907
Everything's fine, you just relax.
Everything's good.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.744
This man is
just burning before our eyes.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.955
<i>Why won't he stop this?</i>

18:53.590 --> 18:54.883
The-- The, uh...

18:56.093 --> 18:57.678
<i>The prisoner is, uh...</i>

18:58.137 --> 19:00.764
<i>The body is utterly unrecognizable.</i>

19:01.473 --> 19:03.642
<i>He's been... Well, he's still burning.</i>

19:05.102 --> 19:06.478
<i>-Lord have mercy on--</i>

19:16.363 --> 19:18.824
Time of death: 8:21 a.m.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.375
Hello, Governor.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.711
Gwenny, it's good to see you.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.212
You remember Mildred Ratched?

19:32.921 --> 19:33.755
Miss Ratched.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.133
What a fine surprise.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.594
Now, Gwendolyn didn't mention anything
about your presence

19:38.677 --> 19:40.095
when we agreed to this get-together.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.182
Oh. I hope it's no intrusion.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.516
Oh, it's no intrusion.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.228
The luckiest man in the world
to be in the company of two stunners.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.982
Miss Ratched, with your legs,
Gwenny's rump,

19:52.065 --> 19:54.985
together, you could give Ginger Rogers
a run for her money.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.072
-Hey, sit down.
-Thank you.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.574
Yup.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.286
What can I do you for?

20:05.162 --> 20:08.290
Well, Governor, we're here because I...

20:09.249 --> 20:10.125
I've...

20:12.461 --> 20:13.795
We believe in humanity.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.172
It's about Edmund Tolleson.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.257
Well, if you've come here with a plea...

20:17.633 --> 20:19.635
to spare a man's life
who killed five of my citizens,

20:19.718 --> 20:21.220
then you're barking up the wrong tree.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.263
We aren't here
asking for a stay of execution.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.181
Mm.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.808
I understand that
he deserves this sentence,

20:26.892 --> 20:30.562
but I don't understand why it can't be
carried out through peaceful means,

20:30.646 --> 20:33.106
like lethal injection or the gas chamber.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.983
Why must it be this spectacle?

20:35.817 --> 20:38.779
We aren't Romans where a man's death
is used as public sport!

20:38.862 --> 20:41.114
I think what Mildred is trying to say,

20:41.198 --> 20:43.367
is the state is making so much progress,

20:43.450 --> 20:45.911
and that's because of
your forward-thinking policies.

20:45.994 --> 20:49.289
To reinstate something as barbaric
as the electric chair,

20:49.373 --> 20:52.584
it just throws us back to a time when
we were no better than heathens.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.502
-Mm.
-I can't--

20:53.585 --> 20:54.628
How was it, sir?

20:55.837 --> 20:56.755
Oh.

20:58.173 --> 20:59.841
Tender as a supple woman.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.677
If I was so inclined,

21:02.511 --> 21:04.596
I'd eat two of them.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.516
Yup.

21:20.279 --> 21:25.575
The current climate of politics right now
is not about policy anymore.

21:25.659 --> 21:29.121
It's about who stands up, who can
cut through the clutter of a crowd

21:29.204 --> 21:31.540
and deliver his message
in a way people will listen.

21:32.874 --> 21:35.085
I'm not a politician, I'm a... Well...

21:36.712 --> 21:37.587
a performer.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.507
Now, I'm always listening.

21:41.216 --> 21:44.678
I'm listening to the audience to see
what they want me to play next.

21:44.761 --> 21:45.679
You gotta listen.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.431
Listen.

21:48.598 --> 21:49.891
They want a spectacle.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.477
-They want that man in the chair!

21:52.561 --> 21:55.022
And I'm gonna give it to 'em,
'cause I'm a winner.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.983
And come November ninth, well...

21:59.735 --> 22:00.777
I'm gonna win.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.448
Ladies.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.658
Been nice being in your company.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.660
Edmund is my brother.

22:08.744 --> 22:12.080
Mm-hm. Well, then, I recommend
you don't listen to the radio.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.959
Gwendolyn,
I'm sad that you've gone so soft.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.545
You won't be killing him.
You will be torturing him to death.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.380
I cannot allow that to happen.
Do you hear me?

22:21.340 --> 22:23.425
-For his sake and for yours, please.
-Darling, darling.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.221
It's no use. It's no use.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.098
Let him go.

22:34.269 --> 22:35.520
Well, I'll be damned.

22:35.604 --> 22:39.608
Couple of sapphos right under my nose,
and I never even sniffed it out.

22:39.691 --> 22:40.525
Gwendolyn?

22:40.942 --> 22:42.944
Now I know why you never slept with me.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.072
Makes sense.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.908
Look, jeez, I...

22:51.453 --> 22:52.287
My sister...

22:53.163 --> 22:53.997
well, she's...

22:55.957 --> 22:58.335
She's like the both of you.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.670
And it's a hard life,

23:00.754 --> 23:01.880
and I understand.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.091
Good luck.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.720
And don't forget,
when November ninth comes...

23:09.513 --> 23:10.722
vote for yours truly.

23:16.019 --> 23:16.895
I'm sorry.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.482
I don't know why I thought
that ever would have worked.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.527
What do we do now?

23:26.571 --> 23:31.118
Sloppy joes, I swear each nurse had one
in that musty break room.

23:31.701 --> 23:35.414
It took all my self-control
not to hurl right there and then.

23:35.831 --> 23:40.669
So, Mrs. Mayfair,
who is the hospital's benefactor,

23:40.752 --> 23:45.507
we've become very close.
I mean, she's a whiz at Parcheesi.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.969
She said, "No, Betsy, I insist.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.722
From now on,
all your lunches will be catered."

23:52.806 --> 23:53.640
Betsy.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.601
I need to talk to you about Edmund.

23:57.561 --> 23:58.687
Um...

23:58.770 --> 24:01.314
How aware is she of...

24:01.523 --> 24:03.483
You don't know me well, Nurse Bucket--

24:03.567 --> 24:05.110
Oh, no, I know you quite well.

24:05.652 --> 24:08.029
You nearly bled to death
on this very carpet.

24:08.655 --> 24:13.160
Scrubbing someone's blood out of
Saxony pile is a rather intimate act.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.496
She's aware
of what he means to me and why.

24:16.913 --> 24:20.542
The fact is, the governor has gone mad
with this electric chair.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.129
He started frying people
to win points with the voters,

24:24.212 --> 24:25.547
and Edmund is next in line.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.382
You know I can't let that happen.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.343
I am going to need your help.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.012
He can't burn, Betsy.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.807
This must be humane somehow.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.142
I agree.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.229
I mean, he is still our patient.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.942
And anyone with a brain in their nut
can tell he's mentally ill.

24:47.611 --> 24:51.656
And our job as nurses is to...
treat the ill

24:51.740 --> 24:55.035
with as much care and humanity
as possible.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.787
No matter what they've done.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.873
Angels of mercy.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.959
Yeah, but what do you mean by "mercy"?

25:03.251 --> 25:04.377
We bring him out to the barn.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.589
<i>And we'll arrange for no guards</i>
<i>to be inside this time.</i>

25:07.672 --> 25:08.548
<i>He'll be appreciative.</i>

25:09.758 --> 25:11.218
<i>It shows that we trust him.</i>

25:11.718 --> 25:13.553
<i>And when the guards ask</i>
<i>why they're not needed,</i>

25:13.637 --> 25:15.597
<i>I'll tell them because</i>
<i>Betsy Bucket says so.</i>

25:15.680 --> 25:18.350
Oh, well, they'll listen to that.
I mean, believe me.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.397
- Hi.
-Who's this?

25:24.481 --> 25:27.567
Hi.
This is Porky, my favorite.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.402
<i>He'll be caring for the animals.</i>

25:30.195 --> 25:31.154
<i>Talking to them.</i>

25:33.073 --> 25:36.660
<i>Then Huck will come up behind him</i>
<i>and inject him with sodium thiopental...</i>

25:37.702 --> 25:38.578
<i>to sedate him.</i>

25:40.830 --> 25:42.999
<i>-He will fall to the ground...</i>

25:43.083 --> 25:44.501
<i>...and slowly lose consciousness.</i>

25:54.094 --> 25:56.137
I'm so sorry, my sweet brother.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.435
I'm sorry this had to happen to you.

26:06.940 --> 26:10.026
As long as I'm alive, you will be with me.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.113
You are part of me, Edmund.

26:26.751 --> 26:27.961
<i>After it's done,</i>

26:28.044 --> 26:30.922
we merely say he got unruly,

26:31.006 --> 26:34.342
so we had to give him a sedative,
and he had a bad reaction.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.386
As you know, that happens all the time.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.225
As a nurse...

26:43.393 --> 26:49.274
I can't say I'm in love with the idea
of taking an action that will end a life.

26:53.069 --> 26:53.987
I suppose we...

26:56.156 --> 27:01.244
We have to face the ghastly horror
of what would be the alternative.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.967
Maybe I should deliver the lethal dose.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.678
That way you won't have to witness it.

27:19.888 --> 27:20.722
Thank you.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.183
But no.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.146
I have to give it to him.

27:34.069 --> 27:34.944
All right.

27:36.529 --> 27:37.447
Thank you.

27:52.796 --> 27:53.922
Where have you been?

27:55.507 --> 27:56.966
What's that? My last supper?

28:00.345 --> 28:01.262
What's going on?

28:02.138 --> 28:03.390
Nothing's going on.

28:05.392 --> 28:09.437
I simply thought you might enjoy
a really special dinner.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.651
Things that were your favorite
when we were kids.

28:16.986 --> 28:21.950
Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes,
peas and carrots, and lemon meringue pie.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.120
That's ancient history, Mildred.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.709
Take off your rose-colored glasses.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.003
You're the only one left who hasn't
figured out what I really am.

28:35.338 --> 28:38.800
I'm the only one who does know
who you really are.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.428
Please do not eat with your fingers,
Edmund.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.601
You could say, "Thank you, Mildred."

28:48.685 --> 28:50.770
Fuck that. You're relieved, I can tell.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.647
I'm gonna be dead in two weeks.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.361
It is two weeks, isn't it?

28:59.821 --> 29:02.282
You didn't have to put some rat poison
in here, did you?

29:02.365 --> 29:06.119
Shame on you,
for even suggesting such a thing.

29:16.546 --> 29:18.339
You broke my heart, Edmund.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.717
I had it all planned out.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.677
And you ruined it.

29:23.636 --> 29:24.554
And for what?

29:25.638 --> 29:26.598
For love, Mildred.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.058
I was a man in love.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.146
Well, why didn't you just love me?

29:35.815 --> 29:36.691
Why?

29:39.235 --> 29:41.905
I'd sacrifice my life for you.

29:41.988 --> 29:44.449
Well, I sacrificed my life for you,

29:44.532 --> 29:47.285
and you abandoned me, just ran away.

29:47.368 --> 29:48.578
Edmund, you told me to.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.748
So you're done with me?

29:53.750 --> 29:54.709
Oh, Edmund.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.047
You don't know, do you?

30:00.048 --> 30:00.924
You don't know...

30:01.966 --> 30:03.927
how grateful I am to you.

30:04.010 --> 30:04.928
For what?

30:05.011 --> 30:05.929
For killing them.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.140
And saving my life.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.310
That is why I did what I did.

30:12.393 --> 30:14.103
To make up for leaving you there.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.564
I didn't know what to do.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.359
I was just a little girl.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.156
I didn't...

30:27.992 --> 30:28.868
I'm sorry.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.122
But I will never be done with you,
Edmund.

30:34.707 --> 30:35.917
That will never happen.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.425
I want us to spend some time...

30:45.343 --> 30:46.886
outside of this hellhole.

30:47.470 --> 30:51.057
I've convinced Betsy to grant us
permission to have an hour together.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.142
In the barn, just you and me.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.981
You can introduce me to that pig you like.

31:03.111 --> 31:06.614
That's great.  That's fantastic, Mildred.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.075
There are so many amazing animals
I want to show you.

31:09.158 --> 31:10.118
Oh, yeah?

31:12.829 --> 31:13.663
Like what?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.708
-Oh, well, there's a cow.
-A cow.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.502
-And then a goat, and, um--
-What kind of goat?

31:24.716 --> 31:25.717
Nurse Bucket?

31:27.093 --> 31:28.845
Charlotte Wells is in the lobby.

31:42.942 --> 31:43.776
Hello.

31:44.527 --> 31:45.528
Hello.

31:46.863 --> 31:47.780
Can I help you?

31:48.823 --> 31:50.700
Of course you can help me.

31:50.783 --> 31:51.951
It's your job.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.371
Follow me, it's important.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.392
Charlotte?

32:17.644 --> 32:18.478
What?

32:19.479 --> 32:21.147
What's happening, right now?

32:21.731 --> 32:23.691
I don't know what you're asking me.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.196
Where's Dr. Hanover?

32:29.697 --> 32:30.907
Is this a riddle?

32:31.407 --> 32:32.241
No.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.662
You're looking at him.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.915
I am Dr. Richard Hanover.

32:38.998 --> 32:42.210
And I have very pressing matters
to attend to.

32:42.293 --> 32:43.294
Okay.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.966
Nurse Bucket, I admire you.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.801
You're a beautiful woman...

32:50.802 --> 32:52.971
...and you have been a great asset to me.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.766
But I cannot stay here much longer.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.980
People are after me, dangerous people.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.857
I need to leave here. Escape.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.861
Find somewhere new
to start a brand-new facility

33:08.945 --> 33:12.740
where I will be free
to chart a brave, new course

33:12.824 --> 33:14.659
into the science of the mind,

33:15.326 --> 33:20.039
and help patients like Charlotte Wells,
truly cure them.

33:20.581 --> 33:21.791
Do you understand?

33:21.874 --> 33:22.792
Oh, I'm...

33:24.335 --> 33:25.712
I'm very confused.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.842
Tolleson. I need him.

33:31.217 --> 33:32.760
He's my star patient.

33:32.844 --> 33:37.473
Once I cure him, they will finally
understand what I am capable of.

33:37.557 --> 33:41.644
I won't allow him to be put to death.
It simply will not stand.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.277
Charlotte?

33:54.449 --> 33:55.408
Who?

33:55.825 --> 33:57.493
-Charlotte?
- What?

33:59.037 --> 33:59.871
What?

34:00.496 --> 34:03.124
You're in love with me, aren't you?

34:03.583 --> 34:05.460
Okay.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.170
Here's the thing, Dr. Hanover.

34:07.253 --> 34:10.465
Please make yourself at home.
Well, it is your office, after all.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.925
And I will do my job
as your trusty aide-de-camp

34:13.009 --> 34:14.802
and go and get Edmund for you.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.012
I'll just be a minute.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.263
Good.

34:17.346 --> 34:19.932
Thank you, Nurse Bucket.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.065
All my work.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.609
I must take it all.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.944
Huck, come with me, I need your help.

34:32.028 --> 34:34.822
They will see my genius.

34:35.448 --> 34:36.908
Charlotte Wells is here.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.118
She's lost her mind.

34:39.994 --> 34:41.746
She's lost several of them, I think.

34:45.666 --> 34:48.461
Close the doors,
we don't want to disturb anybody else.

34:48.544 --> 34:49.504
We can handle this.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.430
That is not Edmund Tolleson.

35:00.389 --> 35:03.184
Huck, I've made a mistake.
I think we should open those doors.

35:03.267 --> 35:06.312
Not one step.

35:07.188 --> 35:08.815
Uh... Charlotte?

35:09.398 --> 35:10.483
Dr. Hanover!

35:11.067 --> 35:13.361
Can't you recognize your superior?

35:13.444 --> 35:15.905
Neither of you would even have jobs
if it wasn't for me.

35:15.988 --> 35:18.741
You with that Halloween mask for a face.

35:18.825 --> 35:23.246
And Nurse Bucket, with your persistent
ineptitude and pathetic advances.

35:23.746 --> 35:25.623
Which of you will take me to Edmund?

35:27.250 --> 35:28.126
Um...

35:29.168 --> 35:30.086
Dr. Hanover.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.630
Of course. It's nice to see you again.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.341
Lucia hasn't been the same
without you here.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.469
I said not another step.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.098
You think I'm scared?

35:43.349 --> 35:45.643
This is nothing
compared to when a Nazi scumbag

35:45.726 --> 35:48.104
put a Colt 1911 to my temple.

35:48.187 --> 35:50.231
He pulled the trigger, but the gun jammed.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.442
Seconds later a mortar hit,
blew him to 50 pieces.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.237
Only scalded half my face.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.030
Charlotte.

35:58.906 --> 36:00.199
Remember the dance?

36:00.992 --> 36:02.410
I am not Charlotte.

36:02.493 --> 36:06.873
I am Dr. Hanover,
I am your superior, and you...

36:07.874 --> 36:10.001
You are trying to manipulate me.

36:10.877 --> 36:12.378
I'd never seen you so happy...

36:13.462 --> 36:14.463
dancing with Harold.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.257
Remember?

36:20.261 --> 36:21.429
Yeah.

36:24.682 --> 36:25.892
Yes.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.270
I remember his eyes.

36:31.647 --> 36:34.734
-Those kind, sweet eyes, and...

36:37.153 --> 36:38.529
<i>...how he looked at me like...</i>

36:39.530 --> 36:40.907
<i>I was a normal woman.</i>

36:45.620 --> 36:46.996
Then he killed him...

36:49.624 --> 36:51.626
...right in front of me.

37:03.262 --> 37:04.263
What the hell was that?

37:11.312 --> 37:14.857
-Oh, my...
-Edmund has done some monstrous things.

37:14.941 --> 37:18.152
But it is my job to understand why.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.155
You sh-- shot... You shot Huck. You shot--

37:21.239 --> 37:23.407
Take me to him, Nurse Bucket. Now.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.117
Look what you've done.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.953
-You've killed him.
-Nurse Bucket!

37:33.292 --> 37:34.126
Not that way!

37:44.428 --> 37:46.305
Oh, my God. It's Huck.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.269
Hey.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.311
Hey.

37:53.145 --> 37:54.605
Nurse Bucket, are you okay?

37:54.689 --> 37:55.690
Who is that with you?

37:55.773 --> 37:58.234
- Tell him it's all fine.
-I think I'm gonna faint.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.152
-Tell him.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.570
It's fine, Mikey.

38:02.029 --> 38:03.239
Hey, who's your friend?

38:03.698 --> 38:04.949
Hey, I said, who are you?!

38:22.758 --> 38:24.844
I was first chair violin

38:24.927 --> 38:28.931
of the London Symphony Orchestra,
you shit.

38:29.015 --> 38:34.312
I played Mendelssohn
for Prince Louis II of Monaco.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.315
Who the <i>fuck</i> are you?

38:52.121 --> 38:54.582
Nurse Bucket.
My, you look white as a ghost.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.043
Oh...
And you look...

38:57.585 --> 38:59.295
Oh, I don't know, uh...

38:59.378 --> 39:02.006
huskier than a bear
stocking up for the winter.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.051
Thanks to your apple pies.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.427
Best in the state.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.137
Well, thank you, kind sir.

39:08.220 --> 39:13.017
We just want to pop down to see
Mr. Tolleson just for a little second.

39:13.768 --> 39:14.602
Who is she?

39:17.355 --> 39:19.565
Isabelle. Isabelle, mm.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.692
Isabelle Blankley, yes.

39:21.776 --> 39:25.404
She's a liaison
for the Office of Prisoner Rights

39:25.488 --> 39:27.823
from the American Civil Liberties Union.

39:28.407 --> 39:30.701
The, uh, Civil Liberties Union.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.955
Yes, yes.
She's-- She's here to do a quick check

39:35.039 --> 39:39.752
to make sure that he's being adequately
cared for, despite his imminent demise.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.590
Of course, Miss Blankley.

39:46.092 --> 39:49.512
I think you'll see he's being treated
with the utmost respect, ma'am.

39:50.971 --> 39:53.432
Who are you calling "ma'am"? You priss.

39:59.355 --> 40:02.358
Nurse Bucket, I'm sorry, I've been
told there was a security breach.

40:02.441 --> 40:04.693
Release him.
Release Edmund Tolleson.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.404
You know I can't do that.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.864
Now, let's-- let's calm down,
we can talk this out.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.491
He is my patient.

40:10.574 --> 40:11.951
This is my hospital.

40:12.034 --> 40:15.454
And yet everybody is talking to me
like I am some petulant child!

40:15.538 --> 40:18.541
You wanna release Edmund Tolleson?
Then you're gonna have to shoot me.

40:20.668 --> 40:21.919
Jesus Christ.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.171
-Get the keys. Let him out.

40:27.591 --> 40:28.426
Ooh!

40:37.101 --> 40:38.227
Where's Mildred?

40:38.894 --> 40:39.728
Who is she?

40:39.812 --> 40:42.606
I am Dr. Richard Hanover, you idiot.

40:43.190 --> 40:46.277
And I have risked everything
to get you out of here,

40:46.360 --> 40:50.072
because you and I,
we have unfinished business, my boy.

40:51.657 --> 40:52.992
So you're a lunatic?

40:55.327 --> 40:56.328
Fine by me.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.706
- Where are you going?
- Just a sec.

40:58.789 --> 41:01.125
I got a question for Nurse Bucket here.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.085
Get in that cell!

41:03.169 --> 41:04.879
Uh-- Uh-- I'll let myself in.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.341
-Where is she?

41:09.425 --> 41:10.259
Where's Mildred?

41:10.342 --> 41:11.927
I-- I-- I don't know.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.388
-What did you do to her?!
-Nothing, Edmund.

41:14.889 --> 41:15.973
Mildred's a friend.

41:16.056 --> 41:18.350
Why is this lady breaking me out
instead of her?

41:19.226 --> 41:20.144
Is this her plan?

41:20.227 --> 41:22.271
No, no. No, she...

41:22.354 --> 41:24.231
This-- This wasn't her plan at all.

41:26.025 --> 41:29.403
I mean, that's if she has a plan.
I-- I have no idea.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.449
You lie to me one more time, I'll paint
your brains all over this fucking cell.

41:34.241 --> 41:35.618
What was Mildred's plan?

41:35.701 --> 41:37.077
I knew she had one.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.372
-What was Mildred gonna do with me?
-No!

41:40.456 --> 41:42.124
I don't-- I don't know!

41:42.208 --> 41:43.459
-Bullshit!
-Oh!

41:43.542 --> 41:45.169
She was going to kill you.

41:45.628 --> 41:47.963
She knew you'd get the electric chair,

41:48.047 --> 41:51.717
and she didn't want
to watch you suffer, so she...

41:51.800 --> 41:52.801
So what?

41:53.469 --> 41:56.597
She was... going to euthanize you.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.474
Yeah.

42:14.907 --> 42:15.783
Let's go.

42:21.163 --> 42:24.041
Well, I hope everything was up to snuff,
Miss Blankley.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.962
Shit!

42:28.462 --> 42:29.463
Don't kill me.

42:30.297 --> 42:31.131
I have children.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.759
I've got their pictures in my wallet.

42:35.135 --> 42:38.389
-If you just let me show you.
-Don't move those fucking hands.

42:39.473 --> 42:40.349
I'm sorry.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.685
Oh, God.

42:43.185 --> 42:44.061
Leave him.

42:45.896 --> 42:46.897
You've done enough.

43:00.703 --> 43:01.745
You don't have kids.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.581
-Coward.

43:09.837 --> 43:10.713
This way.

43:12.631 --> 43:13.632
Nice wheels.

43:14.049 --> 43:16.885
My first purchase after I recently
came into some money.

43:16.969 --> 43:18.512
Courtesy of Nurse Ratched.

43:19.096 --> 43:20.097
You don't say.

43:30.733 --> 43:33.444
I look forward to continuing
our work together...

43:34.612 --> 43:35.487
Dr. Hanover.

43:35.988 --> 43:37.656
As do I, Mr. Tolleson.

43:37.740 --> 43:39.533
Together we make a fine team.

44:52.356 --> 44:53.190
Good morning.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.443
-Morning.

45:01.281 --> 45:02.116
Anything?

45:03.659 --> 45:06.745
Truman's ordered the 24th Infantry
into North Korea.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.331
Forty-six Americans dead.

45:09.832 --> 45:12.126
At Osan, 130 wounded or missing.

45:15.671 --> 45:17.589
You know that's not what I was asking.

45:18.757 --> 45:19.800
I do realize that.

45:20.592 --> 45:23.220
This line of questioning
has become a morning ritual.

45:24.179 --> 45:25.431
So, no.

45:26.014 --> 45:28.517
It's been more than two years
and no one has seen him.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.520
He escaped the hospital and disappeared,
Mildred.

45:31.603 --> 45:32.438
He's gone.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.191
Oh. She made good time.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.109
Yes.

45:37.818 --> 45:41.238
Well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

45:42.364 --> 45:44.074
Mildred. Oh.

45:45.367 --> 45:47.369
Oh, my heaven.

45:47.453 --> 45:50.205
This place is positively divine.

45:51.290 --> 45:52.791
It's so good to see you, Betsy.

45:53.792 --> 45:54.626
You, too.

45:55.961 --> 45:58.255
I don't believe it. Mistletoe.

45:59.173 --> 46:00.883
I mean, I'm not out of the woods yet,

46:00.966 --> 46:04.344
but the doctor said that the treatment is
going better than she could have expected.

46:04.428 --> 46:06.054
She's her star patient.

46:06.930 --> 46:11.018
Well, I have to say
that is just the most fantastic news.

46:11.101 --> 46:13.645
-Thank you.
-The wonders they're working these days

46:13.729 --> 46:15.689
with brand-new medications.

46:15.773 --> 46:16.648
Did you know,

46:16.732 --> 46:21.278
they've discovered that
a tuberculosis medication called Isoniazid

46:21.361 --> 46:22.946
can treat melancholy?

46:23.030 --> 46:24.490
-Hm.
-Or "depression,"

46:24.573 --> 46:25.824
they're starting to call it.

46:25.908 --> 46:29.161
When I think of some of the things
I was doing,

46:29.244 --> 46:32.122
like the hydrotherapy, I shudder.

46:34.708 --> 46:37.753
It is so nice to be rid of them.

46:38.921 --> 46:39.797
Who?

46:40.380 --> 46:41.256
Men.

46:41.632 --> 46:42.466
Oh.

46:42.925 --> 46:46.136
Oh, I know neither of you
have much use for them, but...

46:48.055 --> 46:49.014
But look at us.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.977
Sitting here, sipping cocktails
on a glorious Mexican beach.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.854
Not a fellow to be seen.

46:57.105 --> 46:59.691
Enjoying the lives
that we've made for ourselves,

46:59.775 --> 47:01.735
three strong, independent women.

47:02.361 --> 47:03.654
I think it's just great.

47:07.282 --> 47:09.159
Mildred, you're awfully quiet.

47:12.996 --> 47:14.957
I appreciate all the optimism.

47:15.707 --> 47:16.625
I really do.

47:19.419 --> 47:21.046
But I don't feel quite...

47:22.464 --> 47:24.383
free from the past...

47:25.551 --> 47:26.468
the way you might.

47:28.136 --> 47:29.137
Well, I know him.

47:31.139 --> 47:32.099
He is my brother.

47:34.142 --> 47:35.185
He's not finished.

47:36.562 --> 47:39.189
And he won't be finished
until he comes for me.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.361
Where are you going?

47:44.444 --> 47:45.696
I'm going to get my book.

49:31.051 --> 49:31.885
Who is it?

49:46.525 --> 49:47.401
Who is it?

50:02.541 --> 50:03.625
Hello, Nurse Ratched.

50:05.752 --> 50:10.090
I just came to tell you
that I am completely cured.

50:11.591 --> 50:12.759
And how did that happen?

50:13.552 --> 50:14.428
Oh.

50:15.303 --> 50:16.930
It's a marvelous thing.

50:17.889 --> 50:18.724
I started...

50:19.933 --> 50:23.395
bathing in the blood
of the people I kill along the way.

50:24.646 --> 50:27.649
It's absolved me of all my sins.

50:29.359 --> 50:30.527
Where's my brother?

50:30.902 --> 50:32.612
You should try it.

50:33.697 --> 50:35.741
You've done a lot of killing, too.

50:36.408 --> 50:38.285
Where is my brother?!

50:40.495 --> 50:43.915
I find it so interesting
that you've returned to the water.

50:43.999 --> 50:45.792
Tell me or I will shoot you.

50:46.209 --> 50:47.044
Why...

50:48.545 --> 50:49.713
he's right behind you.

51:00.515 --> 51:01.725
What are you doing here?

51:03.018 --> 51:03.977
Oh, sis.

51:05.103 --> 51:07.439
Don't ask questions
you know the answer to.

51:08.273 --> 51:10.942
I'm here to kill you,
and then I'm gonna kill myself.

51:11.401 --> 51:13.278
Put us both out of our misery.

51:14.196 --> 51:18.200
You and I, we can't go on the way we are,
we have too much damage on our insides.

51:18.283 --> 51:19.117
Edmund!

51:19.201 --> 51:20.994
No, no, it's the way it's got to be.

51:21.078 --> 51:23.163
You betrayed me, Mildred.

51:23.246 --> 51:24.748
The one person I loved.

51:26.208 --> 51:27.375
How can I go on?

51:27.459 --> 51:28.376
How can you?

51:29.002 --> 51:31.463
We can't run from it forever,
so I figure...

51:32.923 --> 51:34.716
how about we just fucking end it?

51:36.885 --> 51:38.720
Now you listen to me, little brother.

51:40.055 --> 51:41.848
<i>I</i> am going to end it.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.484
-Eva Braun, huh?

51:53.819 --> 51:56.530
I killed your man and I'll kill you, too!

51:56.613 --> 51:58.365
Think you're gonna fucking kill me twice?

51:58.448 --> 52:00.033
-Is that what you're gonna do?!

52:00.117 --> 52:02.786
-What is it? What is it?

52:02.869 --> 52:04.996
Darling. Darling, what is it?

52:05.080 --> 52:08.291
It's all right. It's all right.
You're here.

52:08.375 --> 52:10.293
You're here, nothing is wrong.

52:10.377 --> 52:11.378
Nothing is wrong.

52:12.838 --> 52:13.713
It's okay.

52:14.464 --> 52:15.340
It's okay.

52:16.508 --> 52:17.425
It's all right.

52:18.760 --> 52:19.636
It's okay.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.346
She's just early.

52:30.814 --> 52:33.316
-Betsy, come on in.
- Hello. Oh, thank you.

52:34.067 --> 52:37.154
Well, that drive took positively forever.

52:40.157 --> 52:41.867
My God, you look fabulous.

52:42.367 --> 52:45.036
Ah. Mistletoe. Can you believe it?

52:49.291 --> 52:51.418
God, I could live down here.

52:52.419 --> 52:53.420
Mexico.

52:54.129 --> 52:55.505
Who would have thought it?

52:55.964 --> 52:58.842
Though I have to say,
I'm very happy where I am.

52:59.593 --> 53:01.845
Mrs. Mayfair, what a doll.

53:01.928 --> 53:06.516
She put her foot down and insisted that
I be made permanent head of the hospital.

53:06.933 --> 53:09.895
That doubled my salary
right then and there.

53:11.146 --> 53:14.608
And now I know where I'm spending
my two weeks' vacation every year.

53:15.483 --> 53:17.903
<i>♪ Down Mexico way ♪</i>

53:19.070 --> 53:19.946
Enjoy, ladies.

53:20.030 --> 53:21.114
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

53:21.573 --> 53:22.616
Oh, sorry.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.075
Your newspaper.

53:24.159 --> 53:25.619
Oh, thank you.

53:30.415 --> 53:31.249
Anything?

53:33.168 --> 53:34.878
She asks me that every day.

53:36.296 --> 53:37.130
Mmm.

53:38.673 --> 53:39.507
Hm.

53:40.133 --> 53:41.218
That's interesting.

53:41.885 --> 53:42.719
What is it?

53:43.595 --> 53:45.096
Multiple murder in Chicago.

53:45.430 --> 53:47.098
What's so interesting about it?

53:47.766 --> 53:49.184
They were seven nurses.

54:14.084 --> 54:17.295
Sorry to bother you, Miss Ratched,
but you have a telephone call.

54:33.645 --> 54:34.646
Hello, Edmund.

54:36.064 --> 54:37.524
How'd you know it was me?

54:39.401 --> 54:42.404
Because I know every thought in your head
the moment you have it.

54:43.321 --> 54:44.572
<i>I knew you wouldn't stop.</i>

54:45.782 --> 54:48.618
<i>And I knew you'd do something</i>
<i>to try to get my attention.</i>

54:50.120 --> 54:51.329
Did you like my tribute?

54:52.372 --> 54:53.623
The nurses' massacre?

54:56.001 --> 54:56.918
It was a clue.

54:58.044 --> 54:58.878
Well, Edmund.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.674
You have my full attention.

55:04.634 --> 55:06.469
Aren't you wondering how I found you?

55:06.886 --> 55:09.347
I know that someone I know sold me out.

55:11.433 --> 55:13.852
And when I find out who that someone is...

55:15.228 --> 55:16.980
I will make them pay dearly for it.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.149
You ought to listen to me now, sis.

55:19.232 --> 55:20.108
<i>I don't have to.</i>

55:20.608 --> 55:22.819
You're going to tell me
that I betrayed you.

55:24.529 --> 55:26.031
And that you're coming for me.

55:27.741 --> 55:29.659
And that I should be very afraid.

55:31.328 --> 55:33.705
<i>Well, let me tell you something,</i>
<i>little brother.</i>

55:35.415 --> 55:38.043
You are the one who should be afraid.

55:40.420 --> 55:43.131
Because I am coming for you, Edmund.

56:04.527 --> 56:08.531
I was first chair violin
of the Vienna Philharmonic.

56:08.615 --> 56:09.741
If Mozart heard you,

56:09.824 --> 56:12.702
he'd take that hat off your head
and shove it up your ass.

56:13.078 --> 56:15.914
-Ha! Can it, will ya?

56:15.997 --> 56:19.084
Why are you always laying into me?

56:19.167 --> 56:21.294
I didn't say anything.

56:21.378 --> 56:23.463
I just asked you to change the radio.

56:25.924 --> 56:26.800
Okay, ladies.
