00:15.632 --> 00:17.599
There goes our rear deflector.

00:17.601 --> 00:21.103
<i>Don't worry, Luke. Those
two A-wings will protect us.</i>

00:22.038 --> 00:24.039
That one A-wing...

00:25.208 --> 00:28.243
Okay, so it's just us.
Push it full throttle.

00:28.245 --> 00:31.013
I'll get rid of anyone
dumb enough to follow.

00:37.920 --> 00:42.491
<i>Hang on, Leia! I'm gonna
try to lose them on the surface.</i>

00:54.237 --> 00:58.974
<i>Luke Skywalker! In the name
of the Empire, I demand you...</i>

01:29.138 --> 01:31.907
It's getting toasty back here.

01:34.043 --> 01:36.311
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

01:36.313 --> 01:39.715
- Ben? You're blocking my view!
- Ooh. Sorry.

01:44.387 --> 01:47.122
<i>Oh. Good job using the Force!</i>

01:47.124 --> 01:49.291
Thanks for the advice.

01:51.795 --> 01:56.398
- That doesn't sound good.
- It's not. We need repairs fast.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.134
And there's only one place within range.

01:59.136 --> 02:01.203
<i>The Wheel.</i>

02:02.114 --> 02:05.395
<b>1x06 - "Crossing Paths"</b>

02:10.413 --> 02:15.484
This is absolutely the worst
repair shop in the entire galaxy.

02:15.486 --> 02:20.204
- So why are you here, Mr. Cooper?
- Your coupon for 10% off.

02:20.239 --> 02:22.324
I may be incredibly rich,
but I still like a bargain.

02:22.326 --> 02:24.826
Besides, no one drools
over my stuff like he does.

02:24.828 --> 02:26.161
It's so beautiful.

02:26.163 --> 02:28.563
Which makes it more fun when
I say things like this...

02:28.565 --> 02:31.400
You womp rat! You are not
allowed to ride that bike.

02:31.402 --> 02:34.903
- You are not allowed to sit on that bike.
- B-B-But...

02:34.905 --> 02:38.707
No-No-No bu-bu-bu! In fact, I
don't even want you looking at it.

02:38.709 --> 02:43.311
Avert your eyes. Avert them.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.281
- Anything else?
- Well, yeah.

02:46.283 --> 02:49.418
If you could collect his tears
in a jar, that'd be spiffy.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.187
You're going on a
secret mission? To where?

02:52.189 --> 02:54.456
- That's a secret.
- Can I come too?

02:54.458 --> 02:56.625
- No.
- But I could help.

02:56.627 --> 02:59.361
- You couldn't.
- I could help you do Jedi mind tricks

02:59.363 --> 03:02.197
and move stuff through the air
and fight with your lightsaber!

03:03.867 --> 03:06.268
Speaking of which, when do I get my own?

03:06.270 --> 03:09.638
- When you're ready.
- Okay, but I'm going to be soon, right?

03:09.640 --> 03:11.812
Look how good I'm getting it.

03:12.408 --> 03:15.444
How are you doing that?

03:15.446 --> 03:18.780
Is it mirrors? Tiny flying droids?
I want that technology.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.782
- I don't care how much it costs.
- Rowan?

03:20.784 --> 03:24.920
I've told you, never reveal
your Force powers to anyone.

03:24.922 --> 03:28.423
- It-It was an accident.
- You saw nothing.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.625
You remember nothing.

03:30.627 --> 03:34.796
I saw nothing. I remember nothing.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.966
I, um... What was I doing?
Oh, yes, I was berating you.

03:37.968 --> 03:41.222
- Oh, that he remembers!
- Promise me you will not

03:41.223 --> 03:44.406
let this buffoon anywhere
near my speeder bike.

03:44.408 --> 03:48.410
Zander, promise me you won't
go anywhere near that bike.

03:48.412 --> 03:50.612
I promise.

03:50.614 --> 03:53.081
Well, then, this all
sounds promising. Ha!

03:53.083 --> 03:54.950
I am such a wit! Ta-ta!

03:54.952 --> 03:58.254
When I return, I expect you to be more

03:58.255 --> 04:01.556
- focused on your training.
- Yes, Master.

04:07.129 --> 04:09.931
Watch it, laser brain!

04:14.670 --> 04:17.204
No!

04:19.976 --> 04:22.611
Um... I broke my promise.

04:22.613 --> 04:26.982
- But you kept it for two seconds.
- New record! Whoo!

04:26.984 --> 04:31.720
Sorry about the landing.
Our ship has some, uh, issues.

04:31.722 --> 04:36.057
- Can you fix it?
- Lady, I can fix anything.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.895
But... this is a big job.

04:39.897 --> 04:44.866
And that means it's going
to be ex... pen... sive.

04:46.235 --> 04:49.580
- Fine.
- Get to work!

04:49.615 --> 04:52.374
Our paying customers
are on a timetable here.

04:52.376 --> 04:55.477
I'm on it. Rowan,
check the StarScavenger.

04:55.479 --> 04:59.814
- See if we still have an ion stabilizer
in the cargo hold.   - Sure.

04:59.816 --> 05:04.123
Let me help. I know how heavy
those stabilizers can be.

05:07.424 --> 05:10.659
Ah, 30 weight.
The good stuff.

05:14.096 --> 05:17.399
Uh, uh... Busy, busy, busy!
Busy, busy.

05:17.401 --> 05:21.169
Relax, Roger. We're just
looking for an ion stabilizer.

05:21.171 --> 05:25.440
Relax, you say? Hey, I'm not
programmed to disobey an order.

05:28.210 --> 05:30.946
So, how'd you get
your ship so messed up?

05:30.948 --> 05:35.383
Uh, you know, we were out.
We got caught in, uh...

05:35.385 --> 05:38.620
in a gravity well, and that
didn't go too well, and...

05:38.622 --> 05:44.559
- Wow! You are a terrible liar.
- No, I'm not.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.294
<i>Attention.</i>

05:46.296 --> 05:50.398
<i>Rebel leaders Luke Skywalker
and Leia Organa are on the Wheel.</i>

05:50.400 --> 05:52.801
Okay, I am.

05:52.803 --> 05:55.236
<i>They are wanted for
stealing secret plans,</i>

05:55.238 --> 05:59.040
<i>destroying battle stations,
toppling Imperial walkers</i>

05:59.042 --> 06:01.610
<i>and general Rebel scumminess.</i>

06:01.612 --> 06:05.880
<i>They are extremely dangerous
and may be wearing disguises.</i>

06:05.882 --> 06:08.249
<i>If you see them, report them at once.</i>

06:08.251 --> 06:13.888
That guy's got a familiar face.
Where have I seen him before?

06:13.890 --> 06:17.425
Out, out, out! This family doesn't
need trouble with the Rebellion,

06:17.427 --> 06:19.794
and we really don't need
trouble with the Empire!

06:19.796 --> 06:22.063
Wait! If you hide us from the Empire,

06:22.065 --> 06:24.633
I'll pay you five times
the cost of our repairs.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.801
Five times?

06:26.803 --> 06:28.670
Let me crunch some numbers.

06:28.672 --> 06:32.273
That's like...
like five times as much!

06:32.275 --> 06:36.611
Help us, Freemaker Salvage and Repair.
You're our only hope.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.080
Ooh, you are really good at that.

06:39.082 --> 06:41.583
<i>Out of the way!
Imperial business!</i>

06:41.585 --> 06:44.653
<i>Coming through!</i>

06:44.655 --> 06:48.657
Reports indicate the Rebels
docked somewhere in this vicinity.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.759
- Have you seen them?
- Nope.

06:50.761 --> 06:53.981
Not gonna find that
garbage here. No, ma'am.

06:54.797 --> 06:58.166
But feel free to look around
if it makes you feel better.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.303
I just can't place him.

07:02.305 --> 07:05.040
I should ask Rowan and that...
that guy!

07:05.042 --> 07:07.542
That guy is that guy!

07:07.544 --> 07:10.645
Uh-uh!
Uh-oh.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.213
You're a Rebel?

07:12.215 --> 07:16.134
Yes, but don't shout it to
the whole galaxy, please.

07:18.287 --> 07:21.122
Roger! Open up!
You locked us in!

07:21.124 --> 07:23.825
Sorry. Sorry.
I had a little mishap.

07:23.827 --> 07:27.362
I'm trying to shut it down
before it becomes a catastrophe!

07:32.301 --> 07:36.671
- Where is that ship going?
- I have no idea.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.040
- Are... Are we moving?
- Roger!

07:39.042 --> 07:43.378
- What are you doing up there?
- Putting out the fire!

07:43.380 --> 07:45.246
<i>Fire?</i>

07:45.248 --> 07:48.550
Settle down. It's out
now, and everything is...

07:49.485 --> 07:51.604
fine?

07:52.321 --> 07:56.991
You have no idea where
your own ship is headed?

07:56.993 --> 08:00.395
I mean, I do. It's
going on a salvage run.

08:00.397 --> 08:04.999
'Cause we're a salvage business.
Which means we are busy.

08:05.001 --> 08:08.236
Zander, I'm going to dump this trash.

08:08.238 --> 08:12.240
- Can I get a hand?
- Sure thing.

08:15.377 --> 08:17.245
She's following us.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.614
- Was that part of your plan?
- What plan?

08:19.616 --> 08:23.051
- I don't have a plan!
- Well, make one fast.

08:23.053 --> 08:26.621
Oh, Freemakers? You passed
the trash incinerator.

08:26.623 --> 08:29.791
- Huh? What was that?
- The incinerator.

08:29.793 --> 08:33.061
You're not hiding Rebels
in your garbage, are you?

08:33.063 --> 08:36.865
What?
No! Don't be ridiculous.

08:36.866 --> 08:40.616
Then there should be
absolutely no problem

08:40.616 --> 08:44.539
- dumping your garbage.
- Right. I have no problem

08:44.541 --> 08:48.610
dumping this garbage
in this incinerator.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.479
Which is what I'm going to do.

08:51.481 --> 08:54.438
Right now. Here.

08:55.551 --> 08:59.021
See? Dumped it.

08:59.056 --> 09:03.458
Very well, Freemakers.
You may go... for now.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.059
See ya! Don't be a stranger.

09:06.428 --> 09:08.363
Go! Go! Go!

09:16.505 --> 09:19.140
Did you take the scenic route?

09:19.142 --> 09:22.445
Sorry, sorry.
We had no choice.

09:24.413 --> 09:27.615
Well, it's not the first time I've
escaped through a garbage chute.

09:27.617 --> 09:30.418
But hopefully, it's the last.

09:30.420 --> 09:33.421
<i>- Rebel fugitive! Blast her!
- Run!</i>

09:33.423 --> 09:37.826
- Roger! Open this door!
- Let me try.

09:40.429 --> 09:43.498
Whoa.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.434
Ah. The hyperdrive is stuck!

09:46.436 --> 09:51.706
- I blame poor manufacturing.
- Step aside. I've got this.

09:53.442 --> 09:55.567
No, I don't!

10:00.649 --> 10:02.083
Hang on!

10:04.653 --> 10:06.855
No... way!

10:12.995 --> 10:15.830
Jumping! Flipping!
And a lightsaber?

10:15.832 --> 10:18.733
You... You're a Jedi!

10:18.735 --> 10:21.803
Not yet.
I'm still mastering the Force.

10:21.805 --> 10:24.572
- But that's the path I'm on.
- An almost Jedi!

10:24.574 --> 10:26.875
Oh, I have so many
questions. Who's your master?

10:26.877 --> 10:28.522
Can you do a mind trick?

10:28.523 --> 10:31.813
Did you just do a mind trick
on me and I didn't even know it?

10:31.815 --> 10:33.481
Whoa.

10:33.483 --> 10:35.984
You're operating on a
whole different level.

10:35.986 --> 10:39.721
I didn't use the mind trick, but you
seem to know a lot about the Jedi.

10:39.723 --> 10:44.492
Yeah, I do! But I can't
tell you how I know all that.

10:44.494 --> 10:50.265
<i>Thank you, Mr. Jedi. Thank you
very much for saving me too.</i>

10:50.267 --> 10:52.000
Typical.

10:52.002 --> 10:53.763
You think droids are just...

10:53.844 --> 10:56.237
<i>Hey!</i>

10:58.507 --> 11:03.745
<i>Okay, Jedi and carnivorous plants,
you're both on my list.</i>

11:07.883 --> 11:10.785
Keep running. I'll catch up!

11:13.790 --> 11:16.482
Zander Freemaker, superstar hero guy!

11:21.130 --> 11:24.365
We can't go back to the Middle
Ring. They'll be waiting for us.

11:24.367 --> 11:27.035
Then we won't go there.

11:27.037 --> 11:29.470
<i>Access to
the Upper Ring is restricted</i>

11:29.472 --> 11:32.240
<i>to the rich, the super
rich and the Empire.</i>

11:32.242 --> 11:34.108
Hope this still works.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.211
<i>House of Alderaan card recognized.</i>

11:37.213 --> 11:39.981
You're rich?
I thought you were a Rebel.

11:39.983 --> 11:44.285
I am a Rebel and a princess.
I use my wealth, every last credit,

11:44.287 --> 11:47.655
- to fight the injustice of the Empire.
- Oh.

11:47.657 --> 11:51.492
I, uh... I do noble stuff too.

11:51.494 --> 11:55.463
One time, I gave this
guy a half a sandwich...

11:56.465 --> 11:58.232
I didn't want.

11:58.234 --> 12:01.402
<i>Welcome to the Upper Ring.</i>

12:01.404 --> 12:02.704
Whoa!

12:04.807 --> 12:06.574
Never been up here.

12:06.576 --> 12:08.609
<i>- Hors d'oeuvres, miss?
- No, thanks.</i>

12:08.611 --> 12:10.578
I don't have any credits on me.

12:10.580 --> 12:13.514
<i>- The hors d'oeuvres are free.
- Free?</i>

12:14.249 --> 12:17.251
Mmm!

12:17.253 --> 12:20.455
Mmm!
I like the little crunchy ones!

12:20.457 --> 12:22.857
You got any more?

12:24.493 --> 12:27.241
Eat and run!
Mostly run!

12:31.333 --> 12:33.401
<i>Whoa!</i>

12:35.004 --> 12:38.039
Whoa! Who lives here?

12:39.508 --> 12:42.452
<i>- You're early.
- I know that voice.</i>

12:43.479 --> 12:46.280
<i>I was expecting droids, but
it's nice to have a human...</i>

12:46.282 --> 12:48.783
or whatever... touch, especially
when it comes to cleaning.

12:48.785 --> 12:52.620
Right.
We are your cleaning crew.

12:52.622 --> 12:55.556
<i>Yep, that's us!
Let's do this!</i>

13:07.002 --> 13:10.171
Ah, Naare! Come in, come in.

13:10.173 --> 13:12.140
Have a seat. How was your trip?

13:12.142 --> 13:15.143
- Fine, my lord.
- Good, good, good, good, good.

13:15.145 --> 13:20.415
Now, I want to assure you this is
just a standard performance review.

13:20.417 --> 13:23.217
Okay, first question.

13:23.219 --> 13:27.488
In the last year, how many
Kyber Sabers have you brought me?

13:27.490 --> 13:31.659
Is it five or more?
Three or more?

13:31.661 --> 13:33.895
One?

13:34.596 --> 13:36.898
Or none?

13:38.567 --> 13:41.335
I'll just put none.

13:47.176 --> 13:50.344
You can move that bulkhead
with nothing but the Force?

13:50.346 --> 13:54.115
- "Size matters not."
- Um... what?

13:54.117 --> 13:56.584
Uh, size isn't important.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.520
Okay. But why wouldn't
you just say it that way?

13:59.522 --> 14:02.256
That... is a very good question.

14:11.467 --> 14:13.434
Hey, Luke, look at this.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.437
Every time you use the
Force, these flowers bloom.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.773
Huh. Never seen that before.

14:23.313 --> 14:26.013
<i>- Help!
- Roger!</i>

14:33.490 --> 14:37.558
The good news is everybody on this
planet thinks you taste terrible.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.294
Great.
Wanna hear the bad news?

14:41.831 --> 14:43.898
She's got our hyperdrive motivator.

14:43.900 --> 14:47.068
- Without the hyperdrive motivator...
- We'll never get home!

14:50.105 --> 14:52.440
Spot check!
As in, you missed a spot.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.778
Paying customer or not,
I'm gonna deck that guy.

14:57.780 --> 15:00.281
Restrain yourself.
We need this cover.

15:00.283 --> 15:04.418
Oh, commoners! I need you to change
a lightbulb in the grand foyer.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.120
Which reminds me of a joke.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.756
How many Alderaanians does it
take to change a light bulb?

15:08.758 --> 15:12.426
None, because they all got vaporized
by the Death Star.

15:15.931 --> 15:18.166
<i>- Too soon?
- Greetings, Mr. Cooper.</i>

15:18.168 --> 15:20.201
<i>We're here to clean.</i>

15:22.604 --> 15:26.741
- Security! Help! Help!
- It's the Rebels. Blast them!

15:30.279 --> 15:32.713
I'll take this to go, thanks!

15:34.883 --> 15:36.551
What happened to restraint?

15:36.553 --> 15:39.887
Oh, that was restraint. I
could've tossed him out an airlock.

15:42.124 --> 15:44.091
<i>You've got it. It's working.</i>

15:49.665 --> 15:52.567
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

16:01.278 --> 16:02.517
Whoa!

16:04.046 --> 16:06.581
Hey! Careful!

16:09.918 --> 16:13.921
Do something! I would, but
acklay spit is bad for my gears.

16:13.923 --> 16:16.090
And also, I'm a coward.

16:16.092 --> 16:19.560
<i>Those two things are
really holding me back.</i>

16:32.241 --> 16:36.577
- Thanks, Luke.
- Great chat! Now run!

16:41.516 --> 16:44.518
Quick. The diner.

16:46.255 --> 16:50.591
The vermin are trapped.
Perfect.

17:01.536 --> 17:05.539
You can't arrest me.
I'm today's special.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.608
We found this one, but there's
no sign of the princess.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.810
Maybe she escaped down a garbage chute.

17:10.813 --> 17:13.414
It does seem to be a
favorite trick of hers.

17:13.415 --> 17:17.151
Ah, well, we'll send this one
to some dreary prison planet.

17:17.153 --> 17:20.655
And the princess will
turn up sooner or later.

17:20.656 --> 17:23.357
Make it sooner!

17:33.669 --> 17:36.871
I know. Most people don't
expect this from a princess.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.076
No!

17:47.582 --> 17:50.751
Whoo! Look out. Zander
Freemaker's here to save the...

17:50.753 --> 17:53.254
They're getting away!
Blast them!

17:53.256 --> 17:56.257
Aw! I missed the whole thing?

17:56.259 --> 18:00.628
Okay. Also, don't be mad.
I'm riding Wick Cooper's bike.

18:00.630 --> 18:03.998
I needed this kind of raw speed
to just catch up to you two.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.001
Plus, I mean, come on.
I look great on it, right?

18:07.003 --> 18:10.271
Forget it, Zander. Wick owes me
for scrubbing his floors anyway.

18:10.273 --> 18:13.274
- What?
- Never mind. Drive.

18:14.643 --> 18:17.411
We've got to get off this planet.

18:20.115 --> 18:24.385
- 'Cause that is getting old!
- What about the Jedi mind trick?

18:24.387 --> 18:27.455
Could you use it to make that
monster give us the motivator?

18:27.457 --> 18:29.457
It-It doesn't work that way, Rowan.

18:29.459 --> 18:33.294
The light side of the Force works
with the natural order, not against it.

18:33.296 --> 18:37.932
With the natural order?
Hmm.

18:41.002 --> 18:42.870
We're ready. Do it, Luke.

19:08.663 --> 19:11.665
Rowan, that was thinking
worthy of a Jedi.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.001
Got it. Now, let's all get out...

19:14.003 --> 19:16.904
<i>Seriously?</i>

19:17.672 --> 19:19.673
Make way!
Coming through!

19:19.675 --> 19:21.675
Whoo! I look good, don't I?

19:21.677 --> 19:24.879
At the diner, why did you
save me? You could've escaped.

19:24.881 --> 19:27.581
True, but this galaxy
will never get any better

19:27.583 --> 19:30.751
unless good people are willing
to sacrifice for one another.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.254
Hmm. "Sacrifice."

19:38.026 --> 19:40.661
Nice try, Rebels.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.735
And so it ends,

19:47.737 --> 19:51.539
as it does for all who
dare to oppose the Empire.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.642
Those nasty Rebels!
They had us at blaster point!

19:54.644 --> 19:58.746
You have to believe us,
Lieutenant Estoc. We had no choice!

19:58.748 --> 20:00.915
How dreadful.

20:00.917 --> 20:03.551
I'm referring to your
acting, by the way.

20:03.553 --> 20:07.087
You're lying, but I don't care.

20:07.089 --> 20:10.724
The end of Luke Skywalker
and Princess Leia Organa?

20:10.726 --> 20:15.062
- That's a big win for the Empire.
- That's a big win for me.

20:15.064 --> 20:17.631
Who smells a promotion?
I do.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.835
Come on, boys.
Jawa juice is on me.

20:25.574 --> 20:28.409
- Nice work, Zander.
- It was Kordi's idea.

20:28.411 --> 20:31.612
- I just snapped a brick to the throttle.
- Sacrifice was the key.

20:31.614 --> 20:35.049
We had to sacrifice your
ship to save your life.

20:40.822 --> 20:44.925
So I told Wedge to have his tail gunner
trip the walker with his tow cable.

20:44.927 --> 20:47.828
Nice!
Hey, guys, did I miss anything?

20:47.830 --> 20:50.931
I helped a hero of the
Rebellion evade Imperial forces

20:50.933 --> 20:54.268
so she can continue her fight
to restore freedom to the galaxy.

20:54.270 --> 20:56.837
And I rode Wick Cooper's bike!

20:56.839 --> 21:00.508
- Awesome!
- We need to go.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.477
Sooner or later, the Imperials
will figure out we tricked them.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.946
- Um, where's our ship?
- Long story.

21:05.948 --> 21:07.781
We'll need to purchase a new one.

21:07.783 --> 21:09.483
You've come to the right place.

21:09.485 --> 21:13.053
- We have a full lot of Uglies.
- Z-wings.

21:13.055 --> 21:14.488
We'll take that one.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.790
And in the spirit of
our previous agreement,

21:16.792 --> 21:21.896
- I'll pay five times the price.
- I'm sorry, the price is nonnegotiable.

21:22.797 --> 21:25.065
That's the price?

21:25.067 --> 21:27.568
That doesn't even cover
the cost of the parts!

21:27.570 --> 21:30.237
Zander, this galaxy
will never get any better

21:30.239 --> 21:33.541
unless good people are willing
to sacrifice for one another.

21:34.409 --> 21:38.712
Take it, please.
I can't be this noble much longer.

21:39.814 --> 21:42.550
Thank you, Freemakers, for everything.

21:42.552 --> 21:46.053
Rowan, may the Force be with you.

21:56.164 --> 21:59.099
"I'll just put none."
Ugh.

21:59.101 --> 22:02.002
<i>Master, you're home!
I brought you a gift.</i>

22:02.004 --> 22:04.104
Oh, a gift?

22:04.106 --> 22:08.742
I found it on Felucia. Watch, it
does this really amazing thing.

22:08.744 --> 22:12.580
<i>It senses your Force... powers?</i>

22:13.748 --> 22:16.717
- Huh.
- Well, it's the thought that counts.

22:16.719 --> 22:19.053
Yeah, I guess.

22:19.055 --> 22:23.257
Come, my padawan.
We have much training to do.
