00:34.000 --> 00:34.800
No! No!

00:35.300 --> 00:37.500
from 1 to 4 I was whimpering

00:37.700 --> 00:39.000
because your knee was in my back

00:40.200 --> 00:43.000
yeah, we get to Madison next week...
Were getting’ a bigger bed

00:44.200 --> 00:47.000
Eric, my knee was in your back because
you were trying to hump me in your sleep

00:49.100 --> 00:50.000
No, I wasn’t asleep

00:52.500 --> 00:53.000
I gotta go,

00:53.500 --> 00:55.000

00:55.700 --> 00:58.500
Donna, what’s going on in there?!

00:58.600 --> 01:00.800
Um, just a minute, dad

01:01.900 --> 01:03.000

- No, time!

01:04.000 --> 01:06.500

- Hi, daddy

01:07.300 --> 01:10.000

you know greeting this beautiful morning

01:17.300 --> 01:17.700
Get out

01:25.800 --> 01:29.300
May I ask why you’re wearing my daughters blouse?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.100
I thought you’d be mad if I was nude

01:35.900 --> 01:37.500
Oh, what the hell?!

01:39.100 --> 01:39.600
Fez?

01:46.800 --> 01:48.800
Oh, my God!
Did you see anything?

01:49.100 --> 01:51.000
Not, much you should really
think about a night light

02:45.800 --> 02:46.300
What are you doing?

02:49.700 --> 02:52.200
Well, police academy starts in a week
so I gotta get in shape...

02:52.900 --> 02:54.300
So I’m eating raw egg’s,
like Rocky.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.500
Kelso? Rocky, ate raw eggs
‘cause he was training for a fight

02:59.100 --> 03:02.100
if he was training to be a cophe’d just
flunk out a high school and grow a bad mustache

03:04.700 --> 03:06.500
Oh, I’m growing the bad mustache

03:11.900 --> 03:14.700
Ooh! Forman, just because there’s a sale at Penny’s
doesn’t mean you gotta buy everything

03:16.800 --> 03:19.800
Hey, Fez, your suppose to bring your date home
and then take her pants off

03:21.600 --> 03:26.300
Fellas, I’m afraid your little jokes don’t bother me
because soon I will be starting my new life in Madison,

03:26.500 --> 03:30.000
where if I so choose I can wear ladies cloths all I want!

03:31.300 --> 03:32.900
Really? Where is this Madison?

03:38.900 --> 03:41.800
So I can go there and kick their dress-wearing asses

03:46.000 --> 03:49.900
Guys come on. I’m all man,
I’m married to Eric’s slutty sister

03:52.400 --> 03:54.600
- Yeah, how’s that going?
- Oh, not great

03:55.300 --> 03:58.800
but I’m pretty sure when Laurie gets back
from our honeymoon in Cancun, things will pick up

04:01.900 --> 04:04.500
- Laurie went on your honeymoon alone?
- Oh, no that would be crazy

04:06.100 --> 04:07.900
she took her friend, Carlos,
along to keep an eye on her...

04:09.800 --> 04:13.700
But I paid for both of them so everyone
knows who the man is in this deal

04:16.000 --> 04:20.300
Hellos, Boys, it is me, the object of your desire

04:21.700 --> 04:24.600
- Hi Jackie - So, Jackie,
you choose between me and Kelso, yet?

04:25.300 --> 04:27.400
I’m on my way to the pool right now to think about it

04:27.900 --> 04:31.700
rest assured! when I’m in my most delicious
shade of cocoa brown, you will have your answers.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.500
Well this might tip the scales,
I’m not wearing anything underneath my tracksuit

04:40.700 --> 04:42.200
- This is stupid, all right, I’m outta here

04:42.800 --> 04:45.200
Hey, Jackie you want to see something hot?
watch me drink raw eggs!

04:45.200 --> 04:47.300
- Oh, M-Michael--
- Jackie, hold on I’m drinking my eggs

04:47.400 --> 04:51.300
- No Michael
- Jackie! whatever it is I’m sure it can wait until after I drink my eggs

04:52.800 --> 04:53.600
Fine!

05:03.000 --> 05:07.200
- Now, what is so important?
- You’re allergic to eggs!

05:09.900 --> 05:11.500
Oh, man, I am

05:15.500 --> 05:17.700
Yeah, I gotta go to the hospital

05:19.200 --> 05:21.500
That’s okay, I’ll drive. I gotta pick up my folks anyway.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.800
So, uh, Hyde? Your competition for Jackie is, uh...

05:25.800 --> 05:26.900
... egg boy!

05:28.600 --> 05:30.300
Ooh, that must be so humiliating

05:30.700 --> 05:33.300
Fez, your wife’s on your honeymoon with another guy

05:34.600 --> 05:39.400
Oh, no, no, no Carlos is just like a,
he’s kinda like a-like a chaperone, he, uh...

05:43.200 --> 05:44.500
Son of a BITCH!

05:54.100 --> 05:55.500
How you doin’ back there, Kels’?

05:59.800 --> 06:02.000
My eyes fell tight, do I look okay?

06:03.200 --> 06:05.100
- Oh my God!
- What? What?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.700
Nothing, we’re just shocked at how...

06:09.700 --> 06:11.800
Great ...you look

06:13.000 --> 06:16.100
Oh, it’s the sweatband.
I’m wearing sweatbands now.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.700
Come on, Kitty, lets get the hell out of this weird place

06:24.700 --> 06:26.500
I think some of these nurses are stealing drugs

06:28.400 --> 06:29.800
Red, I am a nurse here

06:33.600 --> 06:34.900
I stand by my statement

06:36.100 --> 06:37.900
Okay, Mr. Forman just to be clear.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.500
no going to work, no chores, no driving for three months

06:41.900 --> 06:45.900
- and lets not forget the root cause of the problem?
- To much rage, right?

06:47.500 --> 06:51.700
Yeah, so he probably shouldn’t, like...
Yell at anyone, anymore right?

06:53.400 --> 06:56.400
Actually, the reason he ran into trouble is he was holding stuff in

07:00.100 --> 07:01.700
He was holding stuff in?
Okay!

07:01.900 --> 07:04.600
I weigh 42 pounds ‘cause of what he let out and
I’m sorry your telling me that, uh

07:06.000 --> 07:06.900
there’s more in there?

07:08.700 --> 07:09.500
No no no

07:10.600 --> 07:15.200
He does not weigh 42 pounds...
and these two are the best of buddies!

07:15.300 --> 07:18.300
“Hey, Dad wanna go fishing?”
“Sure, son, let’s hug”

07:20.400 --> 07:21.900
that’s what it’s like at our house

07:24.400 --> 07:25.700
See what I mean about the drugs?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.900
What you need to do is focus on things
that make you happy

07:32.100 --> 07:36.400
Ok...But...I don’t know were we’re gonna find
a boat load of dead commies

07:39.200 --> 07:41.000
They gave me four shots, none in the arm

07:43.500 --> 07:45.700
Hey, pretty lady you like what you see?

07:50.300 --> 07:52.800
Jackie, when are you gonna decide
between Kelso and Hyde?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.100
I already have

07:54.500 --> 07:55.600
- What?
- Yeah...

07:58.800 --> 07:59.700
Oh, here you go little boy

08:05.000 --> 08:06.900
- So, who’d you pick?!
- Well...

08:09.000 --> 08:11.500
Wow, this ball must be hard to catch, huh?

08:15.700 --> 08:18.100
I chose Steven, and I’m gonna tell him today

08:18.300 --> 08:19.900
I cannot wait to see the look on his face

08:20.900 --> 08:22.100
Oh, my God! What if he cries?

08:23.400 --> 08:24.500
Yeah, that’s not gonna happen

08:25.500 --> 08:27.300
Oh, I’ll make him cry, you watch and see

08:31.100 --> 08:32.000
Hey, what are you--?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.400
You get a good look you little perv!

08:35.100 --> 08:36.799
She touched me and it was awesome!

08:41.400 --> 08:43.700
Now, get you,

08:44.500 --> 08:48.000
upstairs for your nap...and Eric he needs quiet,
so no shenanigans!

08:48.200 --> 08:50.800
Mom, please, I haven’t Shenaniganed in about six years...

08:52.700 --> 08:55.200
I’ve hooliganed,
I’ve no-good nicked

08:55.200 --> 08:56.500

09:04.200 --> 09:05.200
Welcome home, Dad!

09:09.300 --> 09:11.600
YOU! You got a lot of nerve...

09:12.900 --> 09:17.100
Showing your face around here after
what you did to my daughter

09:18.100 --> 09:20.500
- Hey, I did you a favor that girls been passed around this town

09:25.600 --> 09:31.200

09:51.100 --> 09:55.000
- Oh, so your still going?
- Yes, I’m still going, to college

09:55.100 --> 09:57.600
- Fine!
- Mom, I gotta get outta here

09:57.700 --> 10:01.200
Oh, Kitty let him go,
odds are he’s not gonna amount to anything

10:01.200 --> 10:02.900
and I don’t want him blaming me

10:04.400 --> 10:08.100
See?
that is exactly the kind of thing that I have to get away from.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.800
- Fine!
- Great!

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
- Great!
- Fine!

10:12.200 --> 10:14.200
- Oh, my heart Iiiiiiiiii---

10:15.300 --> 10:17.000
I just thought I’d break the tension

10:19.200 --> 10:20.300
that’s gonna come in handy

10:21.100 --> 10:22.800
Okay, no more fake heart attacks !

10:23.500 --> 10:27.400
Next time you clench your chest you’d
better see some a bright light and some dead relatives

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
Hey little brother,
Hey, hubby!

10:32.900 --> 10:34.600
Don’t “hubby” me, I’m mad at you!

10:35.800 --> 10:37.200
Aw, but I brought you a souvenir

10:38.200 --> 10:40.700
Oh, look Fez, a genuine Cancun shot glass

10:40.700 --> 10:42.700
still sticky with tequila!

10:44.600 --> 10:45.900
Aaw, you shouldn’t have

10:47.800 --> 10:50.100
No biggie, some guy left it in my room

10:55.600 --> 10:59.800
Okay...Steven, I’m here to tell you,
I’ve made my decision

11:00.500 --> 11:01.700
I choose you!

11:10.100 --> 11:10.900
Yeah, I’m a good kisser

11:14.100 --> 11:14.600
Here’s your gum back.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.600
Oh, Steven, I missed you so much

11:23.100 --> 11:24.600
Hyde, you ready?

11:25.900 --> 11:26.700
Yeah, lets hit it

11:30.000 --> 11:30.700
Who is this?

11:31.400 --> 11:35.100
This is my date, you didn’t think I was gonna
wait around for you all summer, did you?

11:35.500 --> 11:37.100
Looks like you traded up

11:38.600 --> 11:39.800
Oh, you better back off

11:40.400 --> 11:43.700
-Back off or what?
- I’ll call your parents.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.300
My parents don’t speak midget

11:49.100 --> 11:53.000
Okay, okay, I hate myself for
stopping a girl fight, let’s just...

11:53.700 --> 11:55.500
-- Ah, screw it, Go! Go!

11:57.400 --> 12:02.700
All right, Steven you made your point now...
Please, stay here with me

12:03.100 --> 12:06.500
I’m sorry but I got plans.
Hey, maybe you should go work on you tan

12:09.200 --> 12:09.900
Skank!

12:22.300 --> 12:23.900
Okay, here you go

12:25.200 --> 12:27.300
egg whites only,
no yolks they’re bad for you

12:28.700 --> 12:30.100
But the yellow part is the baby bird

12:32.600 --> 12:33.800
that’s the part I wanna eat

12:36.300 --> 12:39.700
Sorry...too much cholesterol, which also means no bacon

12:39.900 --> 12:42.600
just good old heart-healthy Ham

12:50.300 --> 12:51.000
Bacon

12:56.100 --> 12:57.100
Ah, this is so good

12:59.300 --> 13:01.000
and is...
so much better than ham

13:03.300 --> 13:05.300
And for you,

13:05.800 --> 13:09.500
my famous chocolate chip,
Carmel whipped cream pancakes!

13:11.500 --> 13:15.600
Maom, your not gonna bribe me into staying home
from school

13:15.800 --> 13:17.700
with super sweet breakfast food

13:18.400 --> 13:19.200
Where are my sprinkles?

13:21.000 --> 13:26.100
No, no the pancakes are an apology, I
overreacted before of course you have to go to school

13:26.700 --> 13:30.300
- So that’s it? It’s- no guilt?
- That’s right

13:31.300 --> 13:34.300
What a nice, warm family moment!

13:36.400 --> 13:38.500
Lets celebrate...With bacon

13:46.400 --> 13:47.300
Bacon

13:50.600 --> 13:53.500
Steven, how could you go out with another girl
when I chose you?

13:54.000 --> 13:58.600
Jackie, when I said choose between me and Kelso,
I meant choose me, right then

13:58.900 --> 14:00.900
making me sit around
and wait it out is immature.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.400
I want what I want when I want it,
what is so immature about that?

14:06.300 --> 14:08.400
Forget it, Jackie,
maybe your just not my type

14:11.900 --> 14:12.800
Whoa! That was rough,

14:13.100 --> 14:16.700
even I’ve had a better day then you and
my head swelled up to five times it’s normal size

14:21.400 --> 14:27.700
Oh, my God, Donna? Madison has a course called
The Social Significance...Of Jedi Culture

14:31.100 --> 14:34.600
Mom, what- why are you doing laundry?
It’s almost midnight...

14:35.100 --> 14:38.200
Well, with your dad not working,
I had to pick up a double shift at the hospital

14:38.300 --> 14:39.500
this is the only time I have to do it

14:42.800 --> 14:45.600
- Okay, don’t do this
- Do what?

14:46.600 --> 14:49.600
Come down here in the middle of the night,
doing laundry, looking like hell--

14:49.600 --> 14:51.100
- Oh, excuse me
- No, I...

14:53.100 --> 14:56.900
I’m just saying, your trying to make me feel guilty
for leaving and it’s not gonna work...

14:57.800 --> 14:59.600
I can’t stay here, okay?

15:00.600 --> 15:05.100
I have to go off and live my life. I disserve
that Mom, I disserve a chance

15:05.400 --> 15:08.200
Okay, okay, no need to use your squeaky voice

15:12.400 --> 15:17.300
I understand that you have to leave, I have bigger things
to worry about then making you feel guilty

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
- Eric, if you feel like you need to stay, I mean, we can talk about
- No no!

15:29.300 --> 15:32.500
- We’re leaving next week...and that’s final!
- Ok

15:40.900 --> 15:42.300
Yeah, it’s bacon

15:44.200 --> 15:46.900
and I don’t care if you tell your mother.
She doesn’t scare me!

15:47.800 --> 15:49.200
Eric I almost forgot!

15:54.400 --> 15:58.900
How could Steven say I’m not his type?
I’m everybody’s type, that’s my thing

16:00.200 --> 16:03.800
Well, at least you don’t have
to worry about me chasing after you anymore

16:03.900 --> 16:07.100
I mean, most of the stuff you and Hyde use to argue about?
I didn’t even understand

16:07.500 --> 16:10.500
which makes me think you’ve become
a complicated woman and I don’t want none of that

16:12.400 --> 16:14.400
So, your really okay with us just being friends

16:14.800 --> 16:17.000
Yeah, I release you

16:21.000 --> 16:24.800
Fly, little bird, fly, fly away!

16:29.900 --> 16:30.500
That was you

16:34.000 --> 16:37.600
- Michael, do you think I’m immature?
- No, your almost fully grown

16:41.400 --> 16:42.500
Well...Steven thinks so

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
Apparently, I’m immature and that skank
