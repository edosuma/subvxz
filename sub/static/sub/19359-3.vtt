00:18.125 --> 00:19.750
HANNAH: I give zero fucks
about anything,

00:19.750 --> 00:21.417
yet I have a strong opinion
about everything,

00:21.417 --> 00:23.208
even topics I'm not informed on.

00:25.291 --> 00:26.792
MARNIE: Hannah's in print!

00:26.792 --> 00:28.083
I read your Modern Love  piece,

00:28.458 --> 00:30.750
and we're gonna send you
to this super chill

00:31.000 --> 00:32.083
female surf camp.

00:32.417 --> 00:33.750
I can't believe Marnie
roped me into this.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.834
Do you think I have time,
with my burgeoning career,

00:35.834 --> 00:37.667
to go to Poughkeepsie
to support her, like,

00:37.667 --> 00:39.083
sick little tryst?

00:39.333 --> 00:40.291
Hi!

00:41.583 --> 00:42.458
Get out!

00:42.792 --> 00:43.792
-(GLASS SHATTERING)
-(SCREAMS)

00:44.125 --> 00:45.458
(CRYING)
How did we get here?

00:45.708 --> 00:47.333
Seriously, Marnie,
it can be pretty hard to have...

00:47.917 --> 00:49.375
observations about
other people when

00:49.375 --> 00:50.917
you're only thinking
about yourself.

00:51.458 --> 00:52.458
I would know.

01:02.375 --> 01:05.083
( music playing )

01:11.291 --> 01:13.792
( chatter )

01:31.792 --> 01:34.333
Hi, I'm here to see
Chuck Palmer.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.417
- Hannah Horvath.
- 4B.

01:36.417 --> 01:37.959
Thanks.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.834
Yeah, mm-hmm.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.875
( elevator dings )

02:22.792 --> 02:24.375
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Hannah--

02:24.375 --> 02:25.959
Hannah, Hannah.
Yeah, I know.

02:25.959 --> 02:28.250
It's, uh, nice
to meet you.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.875
Shoes-off household, or--

02:29.875 --> 02:33.500
- Yes. Sorry,
I'm that asshole now.
- Oh, yeah.

02:33.500 --> 02:37.708
I mean, I have
my special slippers,
but these are just for me.

02:37.708 --> 02:41.834
If you could put them in
the same line as the others,
that'd be great.

02:41.834 --> 02:43.708
- Of course, yeah.
- Yeah.

02:44.917 --> 02:46.041
I'm-- I'm sorry.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.083
If they could not touch
the suede boots.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.500
It's just a whole thing.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.875
Thank you.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.583
( music playing )

03:20.250 --> 03:23.583
Are you sure
I can't take your bag?

03:23.583 --> 03:25.083
No, I'm good,
thanks.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.500
How about
your red tote bag?

03:26.500 --> 03:27.834
I'll hold on
to this, too.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.125
I'm not planning
to stay so long.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.834
Sure, fine.
Yeah.

03:30.834 --> 03:32.583
Here, sit.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.875
It was, um--

03:41.875 --> 03:43.458
it's good of you
to show.

03:43.458 --> 03:44.750
Well, I wasn't
gonna not show.

03:44.750 --> 03:45.959
I was just surprised.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.708
Surprised, what,
that I wanted to talk?

03:47.708 --> 03:51.708
Yeah. I just-- surprised
that you found the article
that I wrote.

03:51.708 --> 03:53.708
I mean, you must have
an ass-deep Google alert
on yourself.

03:53.708 --> 03:55.792
This was, like,
a niche feminist
website.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.458
It's not the front page
of "The Times."

03:57.458 --> 03:59.625
Well, let's just say
I'm hypervigilant these days.

03:59.625 --> 04:02.959
Look, I'm not trying to get
an apology out of you.

04:02.959 --> 04:04.458
- Okay, good.
- Okay, good.

04:04.458 --> 04:07.625
I'm just looking to give
my side of the story.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.875
Okay, but first,
there's something
that I'd like to say.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.792
Oh, sure.
Uh, go right ahead, Hannah.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.750
I'm a writer,
you know?

04:17.750 --> 04:20.500
And I may not
be a rich writer
or a famous writer

04:20.500 --> 04:23.667
or a writer with a picture
of myself hanging out
with Toni Morrison.

04:23.667 --> 04:24.917
Good catch.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.667
Well, you put it
right in my face, so...

04:26.667 --> 04:27.708
Yeah, yeah, I did.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.166
But I am a writer,
and as such,

04:29.166 --> 04:31.000
I think I'm obligated
to use my voice

04:31.000 --> 04:34.667
to talk about things
that are meaningful to me.

04:34.667 --> 04:38.959
And I read something
about you that troubled me,
that troubled me greatly.

04:38.959 --> 04:41.041
Namely that you were using
your power and your influence

04:41.041 --> 04:46.000
to involve yourself sexually
with college students
on your book tour.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.291
And whether all
those sexual encounters
were consensual or not--

04:49.291 --> 04:53.166
Okay, hold up,
because that's where this all
gets pretty fucking messy,

04:53.166 --> 04:56.041
when words like "consensual"
are thrown around.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.583
That's why
I'm not sleeping.

04:57.583 --> 05:00.708
That-- that is definitely
why I've lost 20 pounds.

05:00.708 --> 05:02.875
Well, that sounds lucky.
I would love that.

05:02.875 --> 05:05.458
Look, Hannah,
you're clearly
very bright.

05:05.458 --> 05:07.583
I could tell that
from the first sentence
you wrote.

05:07.583 --> 05:10.458
Uh, thank you.
You printed out a blog?

05:10.458 --> 05:12.458
No. I have assistants
who can do that for me.

05:12.458 --> 05:16.250
"If one more male writer I love
reveals himself to be
a heinous sleaze bag,

05:16.250 --> 05:17.708
I'm gonna do
a bunch of murders,

05:17.708 --> 05:20.625
create a new Isle of Lesbos,
and never look back."

05:20.625 --> 05:23.250
You're funny.
That's a funny sentence.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.250
Thank you.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.208
But you should be
using your funny

05:26.208 --> 05:29.041
to tackle subjects
that matter.

05:29.041 --> 05:31.625
Me, who I may or may not
have got a blowjob from,

05:31.625 --> 05:35.667
consensually,
in a college town
does not fucking matter.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.792
But the thing is
is that it does,

05:37.792 --> 05:40.291
because if one of those girls
is saying she didn't want
to give the blowjob--

05:40.291 --> 05:44.250
By the way,
how exactly does one give
a non-consensual blowjob?

05:44.250 --> 05:45.875
A non-consensual blowjob?

05:45.875 --> 05:47.375
It would be very chokey.

05:47.375 --> 05:48.500
- ( phone ringing )
- It--

05:48.500 --> 05:49.917
It would involve somebody

05:49.917 --> 05:52.083
sort of holding
someone else's head down

05:52.083 --> 05:56.542
and kind of, you know, maybe
holding them by the hair,
by the pigtails.

05:56.542 --> 05:58.417
- You've heard that old joke...
- ( ringing continues )

05:58.417 --> 06:01.750
What do you call a blowjob
with a handlebar?

06:01.750 --> 06:03.125
Just...

06:03.125 --> 06:04.625
I'm sorry,
I have to get this.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.667
It's-- it's family stuff.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.667
- Yeah, of course.
- Hi, Mayaan.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.583
No, if Miranda wants
to come over for the weekend,

06:12.583 --> 06:13.583
it's fine, yeah.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.208
Is she feeling better?

06:16.750 --> 06:19.417
No, no,
I don't have
her gymnastics bag.

06:19.417 --> 06:23.291
Ask Graciela,
because sometimes
it's in her car.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.583
Well, I'm not gonna
let her sit here

06:25.583 --> 06:27.625
and eat fucking
Flamin' Hot Cheetos

06:27.625 --> 06:29.625
and play Candy Crush
or whatever.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.542
She's gonna need to walk,
you know, go to a park,
whatever.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.875
She's depressed.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.625
Yes, I mean clinically.

06:37.625 --> 06:40.959
I'm-- I'm not calling you
a bad mother.

06:40.959 --> 06:42.792
Mayaan, I'm n-- I'm not.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.792
( sighs )
You know what?

06:44.792 --> 06:47.667
Would this be a good time
to talk about summer custody?

06:47.667 --> 06:51.250
Because I would love
to bring her to the Cape
for three weeks.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.875
Maybe after
the European residency?

06:52.875 --> 06:54.625
But, you know,

06:54.625 --> 06:57.792
I also don't wanna feel like
you're not getting your time.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.291
Yeah, go grab
your calendar.

07:18.834 --> 07:20.667
( sniffs )

07:29.583 --> 07:31.166
No, I asked you,
Mayaan.

07:31.166 --> 07:35.291
I 100% asked you,
because I always
goddamn ask you.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.834
Mayaan, I'm not gonna tell you
when you can see our daughter.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.542
I'm gonna tell you
when I want to see
our daughter,

07:39.542 --> 07:41.208
and then we'll take it
from there.

07:41.208 --> 07:43.208
And, being the mother,
no doubt you'll win.

07:43.208 --> 07:45.041
Rest assured you'll win.

07:45.041 --> 07:49.041
No, no, it's not a swipe
at y-- it's not.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.875
I-- I know.

07:51.875 --> 07:53.375
I know.
I'm sorry.

07:53.375 --> 07:54.583
I'm sorry, honey.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.667
Yes, of course.
I'll see her at 3:00.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.792
Yeah, okay.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.208
Bye.

08:02.417 --> 08:04.041
( sighs )

08:04.041 --> 08:07.125
So, I'm assuming
that was Toni Morrison.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.542
That's funny.
No, it's my ex.

08:10.542 --> 08:13.041
Very tortured woman.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.166
But our daughter
is a good girl,

08:15.166 --> 08:18.708
so, you know,
I have to believe
that this life,

08:18.708 --> 08:21.500
this mother,
is teaching her something,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.000
you know,
building her up strong,

08:23.000 --> 08:27.250
because she's had
some depression stuff
this year

08:27.250 --> 08:31.250
and it got kind of serious,
but she's good.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.082
Listen, I don't know you--

08:33.082 --> 08:35.792
No, Hannah, you do not.

08:35.792 --> 08:37.917
But your work
means a lot to me.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.750
It has for a long time.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.792
It's made me laugh
and it's comforted me.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.291
And my copy
of "Shannon's Rock"

08:43.291 --> 08:44.792
is so dog-eared
and underlined,

08:44.792 --> 08:46.583
you can barely read
the words anymore.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.083
So when I saw
Denise's Tumblr,
I was--

08:48.083 --> 08:51.083
Isn't that the crazy part
about all of this?

08:51.083 --> 08:52.625
Like, about being alive
right now,

08:52.625 --> 08:56.291
that so much of your life,
your world can be destroyed

08:56.291 --> 08:59.625
by something
called "Tumblr"
without an E?

08:59.625 --> 09:02.750
I mean, "destroyed"
seems like a little bit
of an overstatement.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.625
You got a great review
in "The Times" four days ago...

09:04.625 --> 09:06.125
- Oh.
- ...that was a rave.

09:06.125 --> 09:08.917
- You got this apartment.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

09:08.917 --> 09:10.500
- Yeah, I would say so.
- Thing is I'm not,

09:10.500 --> 09:12.834
because I've
been taking pills
to fall asleep.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.542
And guess what.
They don't fucking work.

09:14.542 --> 09:16.792
I started therapy
and for the first time
in 10 years.

09:16.792 --> 09:18.792
Thought I was done
with all that shit.

09:18.792 --> 09:19.834
Tried everything.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.458
Different types
of meditation.

09:21.458 --> 09:24.250
I tried to learn
Spanish, rowing.

09:24.250 --> 09:27.375
You know,
I went on a juice cleanse,
did a silent retreat.

09:27.375 --> 09:31.125
I am now having nightmares
that my daughter's friends
will Google

09:31.125 --> 09:34.792
and find out about
whatever the fuck
this thing is

09:34.792 --> 09:37.458
and that will hurt her.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.291
Understand?
It will hurt my daughter.

09:39.291 --> 09:42.250
So what I wonder is
why am I being punished?

09:42.250 --> 09:44.291
I wasn't trying
to punish you.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.625
I just think it's important
to listen to the voices of women

09:46.625 --> 09:50.083
who have historically
been pushed to the side
and silenced and--

09:50.083 --> 09:52.625
Do you know the woman
who wrote the article?

09:53.583 --> 09:55.834
Do you know
any of the women
who came forward?

09:56.917 --> 09:58.792
Are you some kind
of activist?

09:58.792 --> 10:00.917
( scoffs )
No. I don't even recycle.

10:00.917 --> 10:04.417
Then why would a smart woman
like you write a very long and
considered piece of writing

10:04.417 --> 10:06.333
on what is
ultimately hearsay?

10:06.333 --> 10:08.834
Because I don't
consider the accounts
of four different women hearsay.

10:08.834 --> 10:10.917
Really? Remember
what happened in Salem.

10:10.917 --> 10:12.542
Yeah, these four women
are the witches.

10:12.542 --> 10:15.166
- I'm  the witch.
- I don't see it that way.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.291
These women don't have
the reach that you have.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.500
They can't get
"The New York Times" to hand
them over the op-ed page.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.000
That's why
the Internet is so cool,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.041
because it takes
all the voices that
have been marginalized--

10:23.041 --> 10:26.708
Oh, my God!
Is that why
the Internet is so cool?

10:26.708 --> 10:29.542
Because some might argue
it's a monster we've created

10:29.542 --> 10:30.834
that will ultimately kill us.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.250
Yeah, well, the people
who argue that

10:32.250 --> 10:34.500
are probably a generation
above me, but...

10:34.500 --> 10:36.417
Fuck, I need
a cup of coffee.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.542
( exhales )

10:46.542 --> 10:49.083
I'm not perfect,
but I'm not saying
I'm perfect.

10:49.083 --> 10:52.583
I'm a horny motherfucker
with the impulse control
of a toddler.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.792
- Oh, that must be hard.
- Listen, I get it.

10:54.792 --> 10:56.542
There are kids dying in Africa.
Blah, blah, blah, okay?

10:56.542 --> 10:58.166
But this is
fucking hard for me.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.125
I fucked around
on my wife.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.041
I've told women I've loved them
and didn't even call them back.

11:02.041 --> 11:04.750
I even went
to a couple of hookers,
and one of them had a dick.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.166
I don't have any secrets.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.625
None of that's illegal.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.792
I mean,
except the prostitutes.

11:08.792 --> 11:10.166
That's technically
a felony.

11:10.166 --> 11:14.708
I have never fucking forced
anyone to blow me.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.250
That is not my style.

11:16.250 --> 11:19.500
These Tumblr girls
who come up to me
at my lectures

11:19.500 --> 11:21.834
and-- I am sorry--
they hurl themselves at me

11:21.834 --> 11:24.291
like I'm some fire
and brimstone preacher

11:24.291 --> 11:27.333
who's gonna cure
their mom's bum leg
with the touch of God.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.250
I invite them
back to my hotel.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.917
We may drink teeny,
tiny bottles of booze

11:32.917 --> 11:35.417
if a place is nice enough
to have a fucking minibar.

11:35.417 --> 11:39.250
A couple of them might stay,
and then, voilà--

11:39.250 --> 11:40.875
they have something
to write about.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.458
Because what
do writers need?

11:42.458 --> 11:43.875
- Money.
- Very funny.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.500
Stories.
They need stories.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.625
So one of them
starts talking.
"I met Chuck Palmer.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.291
He's a sad man
with a receding hairline.

11:50.291 --> 11:52.000
He made sad noises
while I sucked him off."

11:52.000 --> 11:55.083
And all of a sudden,
she has something
to write about.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.625
She has a story--
she has an experience, okay?

11:57.625 --> 11:59.125
She has something
that makes her different

11:59.125 --> 12:00.959
from every other
creative writing undergrad

12:00.959 --> 12:02.959
that was bussed in
from Virginia.

12:02.959 --> 12:05.125
Do you understand
what I'm saying about
experience--

12:05.125 --> 12:07.125
the way people crave it
and the way people use it?

12:07.125 --> 12:08.542
Yeah, I think
I do, but--

12:08.542 --> 12:10.166
Denise, the one
who started all this,

12:10.166 --> 12:12.458
she practically ripped
at my Dockers.

12:12.458 --> 12:15.792
Kept asking if she could
come visit me in New York.

12:15.792 --> 12:17.542
- ( sighs )
- I probably nodded.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.500
Probably indicated yes.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.625
I didn't follow up.
That made her angry.

12:22.625 --> 12:26.417
So you expect me to believe
that every one of these girls
came forward with a story

12:26.417 --> 12:28.959
just because they had
hurt feelings?

12:28.959 --> 12:31.708
- Clearly haven't met my ex.
- I feel like I have.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.208
That conversation
was very long,

12:33.208 --> 12:35.333
and a pretty weird thing to do
in front of a stranger.

12:35.333 --> 12:38.041
By the way,
if you're so sure
you're innocent,

12:38.041 --> 12:40.750
if you know that you're
this, like, perfect specimen,

12:40.750 --> 12:42.708
then why can't
you just let it go?

12:42.708 --> 12:45.417
Did you just say
why can't I just let it go?

12:45.417 --> 12:46.667
Yeah.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.375
That's really great advice.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.667
Are you Buddhist?

12:50.667 --> 12:52.875
Why do you need me
to know all this?

12:52.875 --> 12:55.834
Plenty of people wrote
about Denise's story.

12:55.834 --> 12:58.000
Did you call all of them
to come to your apartment?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.542
Which, by the way,
is lovely.

12:59.542 --> 13:02.125
I had no idea
novelists could make
this much money.

13:02.125 --> 13:03.834
No, I didn't call them.
I didn't call any of them.

13:03.834 --> 13:04.917
I only called you.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.834
( sighs )
Why me?

13:09.834 --> 13:11.625
Because you're smart.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.417
You write well.
You write sharply.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.291
Like you're actually
paying attention.

13:15.291 --> 13:16.959
You even made me believe
what you were saying,

13:16.959 --> 13:19.041
and I'm the one
you're fucking lying about.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.750
So, are you really
gonna use all this skill

13:22.750 --> 13:25.375
to write for
some shitty website,
being paid a meaningless fee

13:25.375 --> 13:28.625
to slam some guy
you've never met
but claim to respect?

13:28.625 --> 13:31.583
If not me, who?
And if not now, when?

13:31.583 --> 13:35.208
Oh, my God.
This isn't the Civil Rights
Movement, Hannah.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.250
It's me.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.875
It's just me
getting head

13:37.875 --> 13:40.375
in some sterile hotel room
in Rhode Island.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.291
So, the larger significance
is just lost on you?

13:42.291 --> 13:43.417
You just don't even...

13:43.417 --> 13:45.875
What larger significance?

13:45.875 --> 13:47.917
The power imbalance.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.417
- ( whispers )
Oh, my God.
- You know what?

13:49.417 --> 13:50.834
I haven't been offered
a beverage,

13:50.834 --> 13:52.875
so I think I'm gonna
get myself one.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.250
The part where she looks
like a Victoria's Secret model

13:57.250 --> 13:59.083
and I didn't lose
my virginity

13:59.083 --> 14:03.125
until I was 25
and I was on Accutane--
that part's not lost on me.

14:03.125 --> 14:04.917
Uh, no.

14:04.917 --> 14:07.083
I'm talking about
the part where you're
a very fucking famous writer

14:07.083 --> 14:09.708
and she's working really hard
to have just a little bit

14:09.708 --> 14:11.417
of what you get
every day.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.750
( scoffs )

14:12.750 --> 14:15.083
So, you invite her back
to your hotel room.

14:15.083 --> 14:16.208
What's she supposed
to say? No?

14:16.208 --> 14:18.750
- ( grunts )
- She admires you.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.667
Then you unbuckle
your pants.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.625
What's she gonna do next?

14:23.625 --> 14:24.625
You got it wrong.

14:24.625 --> 14:27.083
It's not so she has
a story.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.917
It's so she feels
like she exists.

14:32.708 --> 14:35.041
And, by the way,
people don't talk about
this shit for fun.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.625
It ruins their lives.
You know that.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.625
- Do you hear yourself
right now?
- Mm-hmm.

14:39.625 --> 14:44.625
I am a grown man
inviting a grown woman
to my hotel room.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.375
Did I put a gun
to her head?

14:46.375 --> 14:47.792
Did I offer her a job?

14:47.792 --> 14:50.959
I may be stupid,
but I'm not evil, sister.

14:50.959 --> 14:54.625
An invitation
isn't inherently
wrong or dangerous.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.208
Sexuality is very muddy.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.667
That's a real grey area.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.875
Or at least we say
it's a grey area
so we can get--

14:59.875 --> 15:02.792
I am so sick
of grey areas.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.875
( sighs )

15:07.875 --> 15:12.291
When I was in fifth grade,
I had this English teacher,
Mr. Lasky.

15:12.291 --> 15:14.041
He liked me.
He was impressed with me.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.792
I did, like, special
creative writing.

15:15.792 --> 15:17.542
I wrote, like,
a little novel
or whatever.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.417
Sometimes
when he was talking
to the class,

15:19.417 --> 15:22.000
he'd stand behind me
and he'd just, like,
rub my neck.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.792
Sometimes he'd,
like, rub my head,
rustle my hair.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.708
And I didn't mind.

15:27.708 --> 15:28.792
It made me feel special.

15:28.792 --> 15:30.250
It made me feel like
someone saw me

15:30.250 --> 15:31.500
and they knew that
I was gonna grow up

15:31.500 --> 15:34.208
and be really,
really particular.

15:34.208 --> 15:37.375
It also made kids
hate me and put lasagna
in my fucking backpack,

15:37.375 --> 15:39.291
but that's
a different story.

15:39.291 --> 15:42.667
Anyway, last year,
I'm at this, like, whatever,
warehouse party in Bushwick,

15:42.667 --> 15:44.333
and this dude
comes up to me
and he's like,

15:44.333 --> 15:46.917
"Horvath,
we went to middle school
together, East Lansing."

15:46.917 --> 15:50.417
And I'm like,
"Oh, my God, remember how crazy
Mr. Lasky's class was?

15:50.417 --> 15:51.959
He was basically
trying to molest me."

15:51.959 --> 15:53.959
You know
what this kid said?

15:53.959 --> 15:56.291
He looks at me in the middle
of this fuckin' party

15:56.291 --> 15:57.875
like he's a judge
and he goes,

15:57.875 --> 16:00.834
"That's a very serious
accusation, Hannah."

16:00.834 --> 16:03.125
And he walked away.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.875
And there I am,
and I'm just 11 again,

16:05.875 --> 16:09.250
and I'm just getting
my fuckin' neck rubbed.

16:09.250 --> 16:12.875
Because that stuff
never goes away.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.708
Yeah, I'm sorry
that happened to you.

16:17.708 --> 16:20.834
I mean, it gives me
a greater perspective
on what triggered you,

16:20.834 --> 16:24.208
to use the parlance
of our times,
about my story.

16:24.208 --> 16:26.166
I didn't tell you
so you'd feel sorry for me.

16:26.166 --> 16:29.500
No, I'm just saying I'm sorry
because it's an awful story.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.000
Yeah, but look at me.
I'm smart.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
And amazing.

16:35.208 --> 16:37.375
And now I have a story.

16:38.917 --> 16:41.250
Can I read something
to you?

16:48.250 --> 16:49.917
Chuck:
"Jessica had
the straining body

16:49.917 --> 16:52.208
of someone who had
very recently worked
far too hard

16:52.208 --> 16:54.083
to lose a negligible
amount of weight.

16:54.083 --> 16:56.417
She was thin, had always
been thin enough to get by

16:56.417 --> 16:58.458
with low breasts
and a tan clavicle.

16:58.458 --> 17:01.500
But it was as if
her form wasn't yet used to
its socially imbued power.

17:01.500 --> 17:05.916
She moved slowly, awkwardly,
as if life was a china shop,
and she a bull.

17:05.916 --> 17:07.916
She treated my hotel room
like a museum,

17:07.916 --> 17:10.375
the minibar
like fine sculpture
from the Ming dynasty,

17:10.375 --> 17:12.875
delicately pouring herself
some vodka over ice.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.333
I asked her
where she was from.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.250
She said, "Around,"
as if someone had told her

17:16.250 --> 17:17.750
that's what made women
irresistible--

17:17.750 --> 17:21.500
being from nowhere
and standing for nothing."

17:21.500 --> 17:23.458
Why don't you read?

17:23.458 --> 17:24.916
- I'm okay listening--
- No.

17:24.916 --> 17:27.583
Read it aloud to me.

17:27.583 --> 17:30.834
( sighs )

17:30.834 --> 17:34.917
"I tried to ask her questions
about what she was reading,

17:34.917 --> 17:36.917
watching, thinking,

17:36.917 --> 17:39.625
about her home town
and her poetry workshop,

17:39.625 --> 17:41.166
about her mother
and her roommate

17:41.166 --> 17:44.667
and the silvery scar
snaking quietly across
her forearm,

17:44.667 --> 17:48.917
but she was silent,
reticent, almost angry
when I pushed too hard.

17:48.917 --> 17:51.625
'Sit on the bed,' she told me
when she finally spoke.

17:51.625 --> 17:54.417
'Sit on the bed
and stop asking me
anything.'

17:54.417 --> 17:58.291
And so I did as I was told
and she reached for my old belt,

17:58.291 --> 18:00.959
frayed from being
the only one in rotation.

18:00.959 --> 18:03.500
And as she unbuckled it,
I thought sadly of my sister,

18:03.500 --> 18:08.041
my daughter, even my mother
and the times they had
resisted being known,

18:08.041 --> 18:10.834
guessing instead
that the man they were
standing across from

18:10.834 --> 18:14.834
wanted something
or someone else entirely."

18:14.834 --> 18:16.291
Is this fiction?

18:16.291 --> 18:17.834
Is anything fiction?

18:17.834 --> 18:20.667
No, I don't mean it
like a Cheshire Cat
kind of riddle.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.625
I mean, like,
did you change the names
and identifying details?

18:23.625 --> 18:25.041
Like, is this fiction?

18:25.041 --> 18:26.166
I did change the names,

18:26.166 --> 18:28.250
but this is what I wrote
about Denise

18:28.250 --> 18:30.708
before she published
her fucking Tumblr article,

18:30.708 --> 18:35.083
before a website called
The Awl called me
"Throat-Piercer."

18:35.083 --> 18:37.500
This is what I wrote
about Denise before
she told the world

18:37.500 --> 18:40.500
that I was a menace
and a sleaze and a fraud.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.708
She doesn't think
you're a fraud.

18:41.708 --> 18:43.291
She clearly
respects you a lot.

18:43.291 --> 18:44.917
Okay, this is what I saw
and this is what I wrote.

18:44.917 --> 18:48.708
I saw a woman
who was lovely,
lonely, and scared.

18:48.708 --> 18:51.333
I saw a woman
who didn't wanna
let anyone in.

18:51.333 --> 18:54.917
And I see now in myself
every fucking guy

18:54.917 --> 18:56.875
who didn't care enough
to push a little further.

18:56.875 --> 18:59.792
Hannah, that is what
I am guilty of--

18:59.792 --> 19:02.834
not pushing hard enough
to get to know Denise,

19:02.834 --> 19:05.875
to get to the heart
of her story.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.458
Do you get that?

19:07.458 --> 19:09.583
Yeah.

19:10.959 --> 19:12.208
Do you wanna know why

19:12.208 --> 19:14.917
I think I really wanted
to meet you?

19:15.875 --> 19:18.542
- Yeah, I do wanna know.
- To fix that.

19:18.542 --> 19:19.708
I mean, it's spoiled
with Denise.

19:19.708 --> 19:22.333
I-- I know it is,
but I can ask you

19:22.333 --> 19:24.667
where you're from,
what you want, who you are.

19:24.667 --> 19:28.417
I can-- I can show you
you're more to me than
just a pretty face.

19:31.959 --> 19:33.625
So?

19:35.583 --> 19:37.375
Where are you from?

19:39.125 --> 19:41.125
- I'm from Michigan.
- Really? Which part?

19:41.125 --> 19:44.166
I love Traverse City,
chocolate-covered cherry
capital of the world.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.500
I ate so much
on a book tour once,

19:45.500 --> 19:47.291
I had to stick my fingers
down my throat.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.875
- Really?
- Yeah, I know.

19:48.875 --> 19:50.959
I'm not opposed
to a little casual bulimia
from time to time.

19:50.959 --> 19:53.917
- Who isn't?
- Well, it takes a toll
on the enamel.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.500
Um, no.
I'm from East Lansing.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.750
- It's not really
that close.
- Right.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.417
And what are your dreams
for the next five years?

20:01.417 --> 20:04.583
Sorry to sound like
a "People" magazine
interview.

20:05.792 --> 20:07.542
No, it's okay.
It's a good question.

20:07.542 --> 20:10.333
I want to write.

20:11.458 --> 20:12.792
I want to write stories

20:12.792 --> 20:14.834
that make people feel
less alone than I did.

20:14.834 --> 20:18.417
I want to make people laugh
about the things in life
that are painful.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.583
That's what I wanna do.

20:21.917 --> 20:24.291
Good goal.
That's a really good goal.

20:24.291 --> 20:27.125
- So, maybe one day,
you'll be famous.
- Pfft, maybe.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.291
And a lot of people know
some stuff about you.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.166
Some stuff.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.250
I mean, they'll think
they'll know everything,
but they won't.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.792
- Like what happened to you.
- Like what happened to me.

20:36.792 --> 20:40.458
You thought
you knew everything,
but you didn't.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.458
No, I didn't.

20:42.458 --> 20:45.375
You listened
to one source and then
you flapped your lips.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.792
Your funny lips,
but all the same,

20:47.792 --> 20:50.792
you made me the face
of this epidemic

20:50.792 --> 20:54.375
about literary men
attacking industrious,
innocent, young women.

20:54.375 --> 20:56.834
That's what
two-bit journalists do.

20:56.834 --> 20:59.959
And you're not
a journalist, Hannah.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.000
You're a fucking writer.

21:10.583 --> 21:14.583
I can't believe
you have a signed copy
of "When She Was Good."

21:14.583 --> 21:17.125
God, everyone acts like
this book is Philip Roth
being the worst,

21:17.125 --> 21:19.166
but it's actually
him being the best.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.834
And I know I'm not
supposed to like him
because he's a misogynist

21:21.834 --> 21:23.333
and he demeans women,
but I can't help it.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.000
I fucking love
his writing.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.792
You can't let politics
dictate what you read
or who you fuck.

21:27.792 --> 21:30.125
Those are my rules.
Write that down.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.375
I'll do you one better.
I'll tattoo it on my body.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.792
- Better.
- ( laughs )

21:34.792 --> 21:38.250
I heard an alternate
title for this book
was "American Bitch."

21:38.250 --> 21:40.083
I have no idea
if that's true.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.834
Can't find any proof
on the Internet,

21:41.834 --> 21:45.333
but, God, if it is,
fuck, that's so good.

21:46.083 --> 21:48.708
Why don't you keep
the Roth?

21:48.708 --> 21:50.208
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.667
I like how happy
it makes you.

21:51.667 --> 21:54.041
But it's signed to you
and everything.

21:55.375 --> 21:58.333
God, I hope someone
writes a book about
what a cunt I am someday.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.625
- Do you?
- Yeah, obviously.

22:00.625 --> 22:03.208
What would be better than
to, like, ruin someone's life

22:03.208 --> 22:06.375
with your wanton sex appeal
and, like, icicle-sharp
intellect?

22:06.375 --> 22:08.041
But I'm half-Jewish,

22:08.041 --> 22:10.166
so I don't really see that
happening for me.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.375
You really are funny.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.417
- Hannah?
- Yeah.

22:16.417 --> 22:18.750
Would you lie down with me
for a moment?

22:20.041 --> 22:21.959
Just a moment.

22:21.959 --> 22:25.083
And I'd encourage you
to keep your clothes on
to delineate any--

22:25.083 --> 22:27.125
any boundaries
that feel right to you.

22:27.125 --> 22:31.250
I just wanna feel close
to someone in a way that
I haven't in a long time.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.750
If you please.

22:52.959 --> 22:55.542
Your bed smells
like snacks.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.375
I live alone, lady.

22:58.375 --> 23:01.959
I'm sorry I wrote
something about you
that upset you so much

23:01.959 --> 23:04.125
without considering
all the facts.

23:05.125 --> 23:06.750
It's all right.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.625
I'm not angry.

23:10.583 --> 23:12.667
( sighs )

23:36.959 --> 23:39.000

23:41.417 --> 23:43.000

23:43.000 --> 23:44.458

23:44.458 --> 23:45.834
I touched your dick.

23:45.834 --> 23:48.500
You pulled your dick out
and I touched your dick.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.166
What the fuck?
And now it's still out.

23:50.166 --> 23:51.834
You didn't even
put it away.

23:51.834 --> 23:54.333
I can see your dick.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.542
It's right there.

24:06.708 --> 24:07.750

24:07.750 --> 24:09.208
I thought that
I was going to Mom's.

24:09.208 --> 24:11.000
Mom thought you might have
more fun here tonight.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000

my flash cards

24:13.000 --> 24:14.792

24:22.667 --> 24:23.834

24:25.208 --> 24:26.417

24:26.417 --> 24:27.625
It's really good.

Excellent, cool.

LENA DUNHAM:
This episode is called
American Bitch.

28:37.625 --> 28:39.917
It really actually came, for me,

28:39.917 --> 28:43.083
out of a lot of conversations
we were having about...

28:43.458 --> 28:46.542
sort of bringing these dialogues
out of the shadows,

28:46.542 --> 28:48.000
and what happens
when women do.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.792
And the gray areas
of power dynamics,

28:50.792 --> 28:53.542
and this idea of putting
Hannah into a situation

28:53.542 --> 28:56.041
where she really had
to grapple intellectually

28:56.250 --> 28:57.125
with some of this stuff.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.583
HANNAH: I'm a writer. And,
as such, I think I'm obligated

28:59.583 --> 29:02.834
to use my voice to talk
about things that are...

29:03.166 --> 29:05.917
meaningful to me, and I read
something about you

29:05.917 --> 29:06.959
that... troubled me.

29:07.250 --> 29:09.917
You made me the face
of this... epidemic

29:09.917 --> 29:12.834
about literary men attacking
industrious, innocent

29:12.834 --> 29:15.166
young women. That's what
two-bit journalists do.

29:15.166 --> 29:18.542
And you're not a journalist,
Hannah. You're a fucking writer.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.000
JUDD APATOW: What's interesting
is in the episode,

29:21.500 --> 29:23.792
he thinks that he's
the one being used.

29:24.208 --> 29:27.291
-At-- Young women in college.
-Yes, are abusing him.

29:27.291 --> 29:28.458
Yeah, they're taking advantage--

29:28.458 --> 29:29.542
-Yes, that's it.
-...of him.

29:30.166 --> 29:31.583
-And that's the subtle area.
-And his success is this, like,

29:31.917 --> 29:34.208
burden and that people want
to take and take from him.

29:34.208 --> 29:37.250
I mean, I think we really
wanted to explore the idea

29:37.250 --> 29:40.625
of men like that.
What, what they do think.

29:40.625 --> 29:44.000
I mean, because...
Like, most of them...

29:44.667 --> 29:47.542
aren't necessarily
mustache-twisting villains.

29:47.542 --> 29:49.667
You write sharply.
Like you're actually...

29:49.959 --> 29:52.041
paying attention. You even made
me believe what you were saying,

29:52.041 --> 29:53.500
and I'm the one you're
fucking lying about.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.500
DUNHAM: And then also, like,

29:55.083 --> 29:56.375
Hannah really likes
this person's work.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.708
She really likes attention
from powerful people.

29:59.708 --> 30:01.875
She really likes complements
on... about her writing

30:01.875 --> 30:03.125
and her intellect,
like there's--

30:03.125 --> 30:04.458
-Handsome older dudes?
-Yeah!

30:04.750 --> 30:07.208
There's a lot in there that...
would be appealing.

30:07.417 --> 30:11.041
And then I think in this episode
she realizes that...

30:11.375 --> 30:13.625
just because somebody's work
is interesting to you,

30:13.625 --> 30:16.417
just because somebody's...
like, you know,

30:16.417 --> 30:17.708
stories are compelling to you.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.250
Just 'cause somebody's
compelling to you

30:19.708 --> 30:21.500
doesn't mean that you should,
like, accept mistreatment.

30:21.500 --> 30:22.708
Oh, my fucking God!

30:23.458 --> 30:24.542

The entire episode,
his plan isn't to put

30:28.625 --> 30:30.083
-his penis on Hannah--
-JENNI KONNER: No, no.

30:30.083 --> 30:31.750
I think that was
a last minute choice.

30:31.750 --> 30:33.875
-(LAUGHS) Yeah, it is!
-Like, I think that happened.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.583
I truly believe
he came to that...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.959
when they were finally
in this real connection

30:37.959 --> 30:41.125
in his bedroom. I don't even
think he, like, meant to bring

30:41.125 --> 30:42.417
her into the bedroom
for that reason.

30:42.917 --> 30:44.750
-DUNHAM: No.
-I think he really felt
connected to her.

30:44.750 --> 30:45.917
-But he doesn't know how...
-And then--

30:46.250 --> 30:47.250
...connect to women
in a different way.

30:47.750 --> 30:48.917
-KONNER: Yes, exactly.
-It's really is all

30:49.166 --> 30:51.000
about consent. You know,
what is consent?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.834
You know, how, how do we
communicate to each other,

30:53.041 --> 30:55.750
"I'm interested in this"?
That's why somebody who's

30:55.750 --> 30:59.583
abusing their charisma, uh,
and then thinks...

31:00.083 --> 31:02.959
putting their penis
on someone's leg is consent.

31:02.959 --> 31:04.792
-KONNER: Yeah.
-DAUGHTER: Hey Dad!

31:05.750 --> 31:07.208
Hi, love!

31:07.583 --> 31:08.667
Hi, honey!

31:09.250 --> 31:10.917
(WHISPERS)
Oh, my fucking God.

31:10.917 --> 31:12.750
DUNHAM: Judd was really
instrumental and being like,

31:12.959 --> 31:15.083
"Let's bring in this idea
of a daughter,"

31:15.083 --> 31:16.750
who he actually does
really worship,

31:16.750 --> 31:19.041
and what does it look like
when a guy can't be respectful

31:19.041 --> 31:21.917
of women, but also is clearly
really structuring his life

31:21.917 --> 31:23.625
around his child?
And you were saying, like,

31:23.625 --> 31:27.208
so many of these people
can't necessarily reconcile

31:27.208 --> 31:30.208
the way they deal with women and
the fact they have a daughter.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.792
-Sorry.
-Honey, take your time.

31:34.041 --> 31:35.458
DUNHAM: Richard Shepard
actually had the idea

31:35.750 --> 31:36.959
to have her play the flute.
Because he was like,

31:37.375 --> 31:39.125
"Let's see a moment
where Hannah sees him

31:39.125 --> 31:41.583
really loving his child,
and that's a genuine love,

31:41.583 --> 31:44.166
and it confuses the situation
even more for her."

31:45.125 --> 31:47.583
Judd was like,
"What are we trying to say
with the Rihanna song?"

31:47.583 --> 31:49.875
And I was like, "We're trying
to say that we love Rihanna."

31:49.875 --> 31:51.542
-And I accepted that argument.
-Yes.

31:51.542 --> 31:52.792
DUNHAM: Yeah, you did.
You were great about it!

31:53.333 --> 31:55.375
I don't know what this means,
but I guess our Rihanna love

31:55.917 --> 31:58.625
will say something so deep
that we don't even understand.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.708
-(KONNER LAUGHS)
-DUNHAM: (LAUGHS) It's true!
