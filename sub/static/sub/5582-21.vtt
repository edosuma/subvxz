WEBVTT

00:10.311 --> 00:13.781
* Remember the last time

00:13.814 --> 00:17.151
* You had promised me
the world *

00:17.185 --> 00:20.521
* Remember how you said

00:20.554 --> 00:23.291
* That I'm your only girl

00:23.324 --> 00:26.527
* Well, maybe the next time

00:26.560 --> 00:28.729
* I'll see that you were a

00:28.762 --> 00:32.200
* A liar and a cheat

00:32.233 --> 00:34.068
* Just forget it

00:34.102 --> 00:36.837
* What was I thinking

00:36.870 --> 00:39.507
* Ooh...

00:41.709 --> 00:44.212
* Forget all the times
that you said *

00:44.245 --> 00:47.148
* It was all my fault

00:48.816 --> 00:50.851
* Remember how
nothing was ever good *

00:50.884 --> 00:53.454
* I swear I gave it my all

00:55.423 --> 00:58.326
* But maybe
the next time you'll see *

00:58.359 --> 01:02.230
* When you're with a...
a girl that ain't me *

01:02.263 --> 01:03.464
* You'll regret it

01:03.497 --> 01:05.299
* And be thinking

01:05.333 --> 01:07.501
* What I gotta do

01:07.535 --> 01:09.437
Sorry. I Forgot my key.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.539
* The last time you asked...

01:11.572 --> 01:13.207
We have to stop
meeting here.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.143
No one saw me.
I was careful.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.545
* Remember how you said...

01:17.578 --> 01:20.114
I ordered wine.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.682
It's in here.
Thank God.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.551
Not the same kind
as last time, right?

01:23.584 --> 01:26.154
That finish was
a little bitter.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.621
Well, you're learning.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.390
And no.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.891
It's new.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.160
Here.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.264
"Marcienne."
Never heard of it.

01:36.297 --> 01:39.267
Ah, it's a small
Bordeaux estate in Pomerol.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.469
Only produces one wine.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.308
Long day?

01:47.341 --> 01:50.311
I really need to talk to you.

01:51.645 --> 01:52.880
You okay?

01:55.216 --> 01:56.284
Becca!

01:57.918 --> 01:59.820
Oh, my God.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.223
Becca!

02:02.256 --> 02:04.625
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:04.658 --> 02:07.228
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:07.261 --> 02:09.730
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:09.763 --> 02:11.232
* How, how, how, how

02:11.265 --> 02:13.401
* Hey, hey

02:19.240 --> 02:20.608
* You gotta come on.

02:29.683 --> 02:30.951
Special Agent Pride.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.386
MAN:
Dwayne. Hey.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.654
I'm sorry to wake you, man.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.256
It's, uh, it's Samuel. Nilsen.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.524
Sam.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.758
Wow, it's been years.

02:37.791 --> 02:38.959
What

02:38.992 --> 02:40.561
It's late.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.863
I'm, uh, I'm in New Orleans.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.366
I got a situation.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.535
Could use your help.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.969
A Navy sailor died
about an hour ago.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.404
Unclear if it's foul play.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.206
I didn't get a call.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.707
I'm the first one on scene.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.209
Before NOPD?

02:55.243 --> 02:56.377
There are some
complicating factors

02:56.410 --> 02:57.678
at play here.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.747
I'm at the, uh,
Hotel Monteleone.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.449
Why don't you come meet me,
I'll fill you in?

03:01.482 --> 03:03.617
What you're asking me to do

03:03.651 --> 03:05.319
is against protocol, Sam.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.288
Dwayne, come on, man, it's me.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.290
Huh?

03:09.323 --> 03:10.491
Just give me the benefit
of the doubt.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.227
30 minutes.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.195
Thank you.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.371
Hey, Chris.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.938
Text me when you get off.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.006
We'll do breakfast.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.775
How you doin', boo?

03:30.478 --> 03:32.380
What'd you do,

03:32.413 --> 03:35.316
step out of Pat O'Briens
and cross the street?

03:35.349 --> 03:36.784
I met her over
the weekend.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.253
Small world.
Too small.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.021
Expand your horizons,
Christopher.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.857
You know, try a real
'Nawlins hangout.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.394
I Ubered from
Sweet Lorraine's.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.796
You Ubered?

03:48.829 --> 03:50.631
From a bar,
in the middle of the night?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.633
Well, it's my
monthly poker game.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.968
It's fun, and I'm on
a winning streak.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.471
And don't try telling me you
were home, 'cause I smell smoke.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.473
Yeah, what's that
I see on your hand?

03:59.507 --> 04:01.475
A "21 and Legal" stamp?

04:01.509 --> 04:02.610
Since when do
you go clubbing?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.278
Since awhile.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.779
Maybe you don't know me
as well as you think.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.281
PRIDE:
Ready to work?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.417
What are we doing back here?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.051
NILSEN:
My request.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.586
Hey.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.887
Dwayne.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.289
Sam, hey, man.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.824
How are you?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.459
Colonel Samuel Nilsen.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.361
Special Agents Lasalle, Brody,
How you doing?

04:20.394 --> 04:22.062
medical examiner Doc Wade.
Hi.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.597
Welcome.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.733
Can we speak
privately?

04:25.766 --> 04:26.967
Sure.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.370
Excuse us.

04:30.838 --> 04:34.007
I wasn't expecting
an entourage.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.443
Team comes
to every scene.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.312
You know that.
NCIS policy. Mine, too.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.080
Yeah, well,
the situation is sensitive.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.449
I thought I explained that.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.784
All you told me
is that a sailor's dead,

04:43.817 --> 04:45.919
making this my jurisdiction.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.456
Now, I assume,

04:48.489 --> 04:50.358
since you called me,
this sensitive situation

04:50.391 --> 04:54.828
involves your boss,
General Matthews.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.330
He had nothing to do
with the sailor's death,

04:56.364 --> 04:57.765
but he was there.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.467
Look, I know
you got to investigate.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.569
But the general's been nominated
to a post in Homeland.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.437
Now, there's a lot eyes on him.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.373
We're trying to avoid scandal.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.674
What are you asking me, Sam?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.742
Just a little discretion,
is all.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.044
I mean, your team,
your agents...

05:11.078 --> 05:12.380
they kind of stand out.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.615
We'll be discreet.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.384
But my team is non-negotiable.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.452
And I expect full cooperation.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.320
Absolutely.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.827
We good, King?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.497
Yeah.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.964
Yeah, but, uh...

05:30.998 --> 05:34.368
hats and jackets off.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.405
We're going in
the service entrance.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.712
Lieutenant Rebecca Peterson, 33.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.614
Works for the Port Services,

05:46.647 --> 05:49.082
overseeing Navy contractors
in New Orleans.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.585
She lives in town;
suggests this room wasn't hers.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.921
LASALLE:
Two wine glasses.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.889
She was being entertained.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.458
That's an assumption.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.493
No, sir. Observation.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.896
What do you got, Loretta?

06:02.930 --> 06:04.532
There's no sign
of external trauma.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.899
Copious amounts of blood;

06:05.933 --> 06:07.501
possible internal bleeding.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.903
BRODY:
Bloody T-shirt.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.171
Men's extra-large.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.506
Probably used
in an attempt

06:12.540 --> 06:13.907
to staunch
the bleeding.

06:13.941 --> 06:17.445
Who'd you say
the room belonged to?

06:17.478 --> 06:19.012
I didn't.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.552
Time to talk to him, Sam.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.862
Wait in the hall,
please.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.898
Outside, please.
Thank you.

06:41.969 --> 06:42.936
General Matthews, sir.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.541
I tried to help;
the blood just kept coming.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.942
Just, why don't
you sit down, sir?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.811
I'll get you something.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.218
Here you go.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.553
General, can you
tell me what happened?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.021
Yeah, but...

07:01.054 --> 07:02.623
Becca had barely
walked in the room,

07:02.656 --> 07:05.626
just started coughing and...

07:05.659 --> 07:07.695
bleeding.

07:07.728 --> 07:11.665
She was dead
before I could dial 911.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.668
Have to tell David.

07:14.702 --> 07:15.936
Yes, sir.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.505
Her father.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.206
He was the general's
roommate back at VMI.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.808
That how you knew Rebecca?

07:20.841 --> 07:22.643
Our kids grew up together.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.578
He's had a hard time
since his wife died.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.548
Becca was...

07:27.581 --> 07:28.982
his whole world.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.851
We'll have, uh,
CACO make that notification.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.854
Rebecca sick?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.589
Have allergies?

07:35.623 --> 07:37.825
I have no idea.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.560
You feeling all right, General?
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.562
Uh... migraine coming on.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.696
It happens.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.065
Maybe we could do this
another time.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.536
Why was Rebecca
in your room, sir?

07:50.538 --> 07:52.573
She knew I was in town.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.807
Dropped by to say hi.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.043
Just to say hello?
Noticed that

07:56.076 --> 07:57.811
the two of you were
sharing a bottle of wine.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.046
How is that relevant, Dwayne?
Come on.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.514
Standard question, Sam.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.649
That's a loaded question.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.117
I know what you're thinking,
same as your other agents.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.886
Becca's an old
family friend.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.955
Hadn't seen her in years.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.757
That's all.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.596
LASALLE:
So, Nilsen

08:15.629 --> 08:17.631
works with
Owen Matthews?

08:17.665 --> 08:19.132
Three-star general.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.635
Been in every major war
since 1990.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.103
Rumor is he's on track to be

08:23.136 --> 08:25.105
Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs one day.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.240
Yeah, well,
I don't care what track he's on.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.943
Fraternizing
with a junior officer--

08:29.977 --> 08:32.680
that's no bueno.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.917
Look, I know you want
to take things slow, Sam,

08:36.950 --> 08:40.020
but we're gonna need to loop
NOPD and Army CID in on this.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.655
Can't it wait
till after autopsy?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.156
I mean, if there's
no signs of foul play?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.958
Don't need this secrecy.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.027
It's not warranted
if-if he's telling the truth.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.161
He is.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.602
She's been poisoned.
BRODY:
Are you sure?

08:54.635 --> 08:55.836
'Cause usually, it's
"gotta wait till autopsy,

08:55.869 --> 08:57.204
I'll know more when..."

08:57.237 --> 08:58.639
Leukonychia striata.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.875
It's a telltale sign
of arsenic overdose.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.611
And by the bloody vomit,

09:03.644 --> 09:05.579
I'd say it was ingested.

09:05.613 --> 09:08.181
She did have wine
before she died.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.083
And she wasn't
drinking alone.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.787
But the headlines, man...

09:13.821 --> 09:15.656
You know, "dead girl found
in general's hotel room."

09:15.689 --> 09:17.357
I mean, it doesn't matter
what the truth is.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.358
People survive bad press.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.793
Maybe in your line of work.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.662
But the general
is a public figure

09:21.695 --> 09:23.631
looking to take on
a high-profile position.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.032
There's no way he weathers
a news cycle like this.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.634
WADE: I don't care
if the president's in there,

09:26.667 --> 09:29.269
I'm going in.
Open the door!

09:29.302 --> 09:30.738
Okay, let her in.
Let her...
The general, where is he?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.239
Where is he?
NILSEN:
Wait, ma'am!

09:32.272 --> 09:33.907
Sir, I'm Dr. Wade.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.743
I need to know
how you're feeling.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.077
Okay. A little headache.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.946
Chest tightness
What's going on?

09:38.979 --> 09:40.948
Did you have wine tonight?
NISLEN:
Wait, wait, wait!

09:40.981 --> 09:42.816
You can't ask him that!
Loretta...

09:42.850 --> 09:45.118
I'm not drunk!
Loretta, what...

09:45.152 --> 09:46.954
Sir? Sir, sir!

09:46.987 --> 09:48.055
Please!
We have to call the paramedics.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.723
No! We can't.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.124
Rebecca Peterson was poisoned.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.760
General could have been, too.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.762
He has to get
to the hospital right now

09:54.795 --> 09:55.796
or he could die.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.344
*

10:11.378 --> 10:12.379
NILSEN:
I understand.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.047
Yep. Uh-huh.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.049
We'll speak again soon.
Thank you.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.218
How's the general?

10:18.251 --> 10:19.653
He's hanging in.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.254
He's on hemodialysis

10:21.288 --> 10:23.924
and chelation therapy
for the arsenic overdose.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.358
I also spoke to CID.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.027
They have asked us
to keep them updated.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.062
Well, here's what we got so far.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.231
Our forensic scientist
tested the wine

10:31.264 --> 10:33.366
from the general's room--
no poison.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.935
He and Brody are
at the Monteleone,

10:34.968 --> 10:36.436
looking other
possible sources.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.106
And, yes,
they're being discreet.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.908
I looked into Rebecca.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.343
Now, she is a squared-away
sailor, pays her bills on time.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.847
I mean, no one had
an obvious motive to kill her.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.716
Well, of course,
they didn't, right?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.450
The arsenic was clearly meant
for General Matthews.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.386
He's done a lot of good work
for our country, but he's

10:53.420 --> 10:55.188
made some of enemies
in the process.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.457
You're saying enemy of the state
poisoned your guy?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.693
Or some whack-a-do activist,
doesn't like the Army.

10:59.727 --> 11:02.730
Or given the general's
nomination to Homeland,

11:02.763 --> 11:04.765
we might even be
looking at espionage.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.000
Let's not forget
who our actual victim is here--

11:07.034 --> 11:08.769
Rebecca Peterson.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.338
It's unfortunate
collateral damage.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.840
LASALLE:
"Collateral damage"?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.107
Oh, all right, okay.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.976
Until we know more,

11:16.009 --> 11:17.377
we'll investigate
both victims.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.947
Sam, start a list
of potential suspects.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.715
And, Chris?

11:21.749 --> 11:23.851
Go see Rebecca's father.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.452
Not so fast.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.355
The general has operated at the
highest level of the military.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.057
Yeah, so you've said.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.760
And protecting him is matter
of national security.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.128
This investigation
is compartmented.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.764
It's on a need-to-know basis.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.497
Well, Lieutenant Peterson's

11:37.530 --> 11:39.366
father needs to know.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.834
You can speak to him.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.870
Just no details
about her cause of death.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.772
We cannot let it get out

11:44.805 --> 11:46.473
that General Matthews
has been poisoned.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.810
Hey, are you asking me
to lie to a grieving father?

11:49.843 --> 11:52.312
The order came from
the Army Chief of Staff.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.514
Well, you answer
to the Army, not us.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.984
Christopher, Colonel's right.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.418
Till we have a suspect
in custody,

11:58.451 --> 12:00.320
the general's safety
is paramount.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.923
Case is on a need-to-know basis.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.257
Look, this isn't us, King.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.293
All right,
this is not what we do.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.762
We'll make sure the ends
justify the means.

12:08.796 --> 12:09.797
Right, Sam?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.098
That's right.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.945
No signs of arsenic anywhere?

12:24.978 --> 12:26.814
The room,
the elevator, in here?

12:26.847 --> 12:29.549
Nope, the kitchen
is officially...

12:29.582 --> 12:31.118
Salmonella and E.coli-free!

12:31.151 --> 12:33.453
Okay, guys,back to work.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.156
Which is a huge relief.
Guess General Matthews'

12:36.189 --> 12:37.958
food poisoning must've come
from somewhere else.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.960
As I assured you
it did.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.294
All VIP guests are assigned

12:41.328 --> 12:43.130
a private concierge.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.098
Mr. Shapiro attended to
the general's needs last night,

12:45.132 --> 12:46.834
as he does every visit.

12:46.867 --> 12:47.968
What time did
General Matthews check in?

12:48.001 --> 12:49.269
A little after midnight.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.171
I had his wine
waiting in his room,

12:51.204 --> 12:53.140
per his request.
Yeah, but the wine
wasn't contaminated.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.107
We tested it--

12:54.141 --> 12:55.843
Which, uh, seems odd...

12:55.876 --> 12:57.845
uh, because you're like,
"E.coli in wine?

12:57.878 --> 13:00.380
That's weird-- there's only been
two recorded cases."

13:00.413 --> 13:02.415
But you know, it never
hurts to-to be, uh, safe.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.385
Did anyone else had access
to General Matthews' room?

13:05.418 --> 13:07.454
VIPs have special keys.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.522
Not even housekeeping
has copies.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.058
Well, uh, actually,
General Matthews

13:11.091 --> 13:12.860
asked for an additional key.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.595
For a friend.
Why didn't I know about this?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.065
Oh, "a friend"-- the plot
is thickening, that's...

13:18.098 --> 13:20.400
I'm sorry, I never get a chance
to see this side of it.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.602
You know?
It's really fascinating.
Who was the key for?

13:22.635 --> 13:25.272
I don't know her name,
but she was here last night.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.107
Comes to see General Matthews
whenever he's in town.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.543
Rebecca Peterson's
stomach and intestines

13:30.577 --> 13:32.913
were saturated
with inorganic arsenic.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.414
It's the bad kind.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.548
I didn't realize
there was a good kind.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.584
Well, everything
in moderation.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.452
So, C.O.D. is official?
Yes.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.620
There were over 600 milligrams

13:40.653 --> 13:42.622
of arsenic in Rebecca's body.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.624
Enough to kill her
two times over.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.227
So, whoever did this
wasn't messing around.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.163
Any idea how much was
in the general's system?

13:50.197 --> 13:53.400
Mm-mm, but he's still alive.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.235
With his build--
bigger body type--

13:55.268 --> 13:58.205
the dose must've been
much smaller.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.907
Do we know how
they were poisoned?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.308
Well, Rebecca's
digestive system

14:01.341 --> 14:03.176
worked far too
well for that.

14:03.210 --> 14:07.014
But based on toxicity levels
and rates of absorption,

14:07.047 --> 14:11.919
the when--
between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.522
That's 15 hours before she went
to General Matthews' hotel room.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.856
Give or take.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.094
Could the general
have been exposed

14:21.128 --> 14:23.496
by coming in contact
with Rebecca's blood?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.165
Bodily fluids?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.533
Uh, it doesn't work like that.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.502
You have to receive
a dose firsthand.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.938
That doesn't add up.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.439
You sure you're not
missing something?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.077
Of course you're not.
I'm sorry, I'm...

14:37.110 --> 14:39.046
I'm getting a little pressure
on this and...

14:39.079 --> 14:40.513
Because of your friend Nilsen?

14:40.547 --> 14:43.583
Yeah, known him
since grade school.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.353
Saved him from getting
beaten up more than once.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.555
He was that kid who
always told the truth,

14:48.588 --> 14:50.390
even when he should've
kept his mouth closed.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.424
And now?

14:51.458 --> 14:53.593
Same guy.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.929
Different loyalties.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.631
Military chain of command
is extremely efficient

14:58.665 --> 15:00.700
at protecting national security.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.603
But when it comes
to internal investigations,

15:03.636 --> 15:05.973
they can lack
a certain objectivity.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.340
Well, I don't envy you.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.709
Must be the reason
why I chose this line of work.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.945
No one argues with me here.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.014
But this one

15:14.047 --> 15:16.516
might see more fraught
than usual,

15:16.549 --> 15:20.487
but it's painfully
simple in the end.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.690
All you have to do is find
justice for this young woman.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.669
Mr. Peterson?

15:36.703 --> 15:38.171
NCIS.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.673
Special Agent Lasalle.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.310
And I'm so sorry
for your loss.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.645
This is your daughter's house?

15:45.678 --> 15:49.149
The officer who called
said Becca died unexpectedly.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.417
That's all.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.751
You here to tell me
what happened?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.154
We can't release any details.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.488
I'm just here to ask
a few questions

15:55.522 --> 15:57.724
for our investigation.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.093
"Investigation"?

16:00.127 --> 16:03.230
Means this is more
than an accident, right?

16:03.263 --> 16:05.665
Well, NCIS reviews
all Navy deaths--

16:05.698 --> 16:07.067
I know how it works.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.269
Spent my life in the service.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.770
But if it was straightforward,

16:10.803 --> 16:13.473
you wouldn't be dodging
my questions.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.442
Sir, I...

16:15.475 --> 16:18.011
I know how upsetting
this must be.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.346
How the hell would you know?!

16:19.379 --> 16:21.414
You're the one painting
a fence your daughter

16:21.448 --> 16:24.984
asked you to about a month ago,
but you never made time?

16:26.353 --> 16:28.655
Now it doesn't matter.

16:28.688 --> 16:32.525
Look, I give you my word
that I'll come back here,

16:32.559 --> 16:35.462
and answer every
question you have.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.030
But as for right now,

16:37.064 --> 16:39.066
all I can say is

16:39.099 --> 16:41.768
I need your help.

16:41.801 --> 16:42.802
All right?
For Rebecca.

16:46.373 --> 16:49.642
What can I tell you?

16:49.676 --> 16:53.180
Becca loved her job,
worked all the time.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.615
Kept her private life private.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.417
Though...

16:57.450 --> 16:59.719
I suspect
she was dating someone.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.721
What made you think that?

17:01.754 --> 17:03.723
Well, she, she'd been
busier than usual.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.093
Out a lot, at-at nights.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.760
Something had
her attention.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.263
Then there was
her unexpected trip

17:10.297 --> 17:12.365
to Florida.

17:12.399 --> 17:15.068
Mind if I take a
look in the house?

17:21.174 --> 17:23.610
Look at whatever you need to.

17:25.812 --> 17:29.649
Just want to know
what happened to my girl.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.129
Tell me things.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.062
Just heard from the hospital.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.132
General Matthews is
gonna pull through.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.567
Nilsen's over there
now getting updated.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.203
That's good news.
What are you two doing?

17:50.237 --> 17:53.173
Well, Nilsen gave us access
to the general's Army files.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.541
Mostly redacted.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.276
Even travel itineraries.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.644
Why travel itineraries?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.112
Concierge at the Monteleone says

17:59.146 --> 18:00.147
that every time
Matthews is in town,

18:00.180 --> 18:02.682
he has one regular visitor.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.651
Rebecca Peterson.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.319
She even has
her own key.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.621
The general said
he hadn't seen her in years.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.823
Rebecca's father thought
she had a boyfriend.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.793
Said she was secretive about it.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.695
Makes sense--
no fun telling Daddy

18:15.728 --> 18:17.497
you're dating
his college roommate.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.899
Affair between officers
of different ranks

18:19.932 --> 18:23.803
is a violation of the Uniform
Code of Military Justice.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.672
Which brings us back to travel.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.541
Rebecca went to Miami,
supposedly to visit a friend.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.178
Matthews travels
to USSOUTHCOM

18:31.211 --> 18:33.580
in Miami regularly
on Army business.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.683
The general's travel itinerary

18:36.716 --> 18:38.885
and Rebecca's
credit card bill.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.187
Take a look.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.388
Miami dates overlap.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.290
Charges at the same restaurant.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.657
Matthews stayed
at the Rey Del Mar.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.226
And Rebecca doesn't have

18:46.259 --> 18:47.927
any hotel charges
on her card.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.196
Well, hold on a second.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.264
I saw that name somewhere.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.267
Personal items
from Rebecca's home,

18:54.301 --> 18:57.337
including hotel
stationary--

18:57.370 --> 18:59.239
Rey Del Mar.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.607
And inside...

19:00.640 --> 19:03.176
is a note.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.445
"To Becca."

19:05.478 --> 19:07.180
"You know how I feel
about you,

19:07.214 --> 19:09.282
"but if what we're doing
gets out, my career is over.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.783
"You can't let that happen.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.620
O.M."

19:13.653 --> 19:16.756
General Matthews just went
from victim to prime suspect

19:16.789 --> 19:19.192
in Rebecca Peterson's murder.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.673
LASALLE:
I talked to the doctor.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.308
General Matthews
had less than 10 milligrams

19:35.342 --> 19:37.310
of arsenic in his system.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.845
Enough to give him symptoms.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.313
But not actually
put him at risk.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.283
Yeah, doses himself
to take suspicion off.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.352
General's files are fascinating.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.323
He's monitoring safety issues
I never even heard of.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.492
You

19:52.525 --> 19:54.861
No, but I do know it's
time for us to bring

19:54.894 --> 19:56.363
the general in
for questioning.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.664
Not yet.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.366
Pride, he lied to us.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.301
All right, hid the fact
that he'd been seeing

20:01.334 --> 20:03.002
Lieutenant Peterson for months.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.373
I know that,
but it's not enough.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.841
He had the means and the motive
and the opportunity

20:08.875 --> 20:10.610
to kill Rebecca Peterson.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.944
If it was any other suspect

20:11.978 --> 20:13.380
they'd be in
that room right now.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.315
But it's not any other suspect!

20:15.348 --> 20:17.317
It's a three-star general.
He's a war hero!

20:17.350 --> 20:18.618
It doesn't
make a difference

20:18.651 --> 20:20.320
who it is
if he's a murderer.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.021
Petty officer,
that's one thing.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.557
A flag officer, okay?

20:24.591 --> 20:27.294
There's scrutiny at every level.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.362
Yeah, I'm not scared.
Listen to me, Chris.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.831
Matthews,
if we're wrong--

20:31.864 --> 20:33.500
hell, even if we're right--

20:33.533 --> 20:36.369
he'll bring fire
and brimstone down on us.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.338
And that will become
our focus, not the case.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.972
So before we move on him,

20:40.006 --> 20:42.542
we need to dot our I's
and cross our T's.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.377
And that is the best way

20:44.411 --> 20:46.713
to find justice
for Rebecca!
This--

20:47.980 --> 20:49.916
Spoke with Rebecca's CO.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.286
He said she reported for work
yesterday at 6:46 a.m.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.921
and didn't leave till noon,

20:54.954 --> 20:57.357
which means the arsenic
was ingested while there.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.427
Go to Rebecca's office,
find that poison.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.995
We connect it to the suspect--
whoever it is--

21:03.029 --> 21:05.298
we'll bring him in.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.701
*

21:13.473 --> 21:16.776
That's everything
from Becca's office.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.078
Get it to Sebastian,
see if he can find

21:19.111 --> 21:20.447
any traces of arsenic.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.681
Find any prints?

21:21.714 --> 21:23.516
Checked doors, desk,
water coolers.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.517
No prints.

21:24.551 --> 21:25.985
All wiped clean.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.820
Well, someone else was
in there before us.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.989
I've got a list of the people
who have access to the building.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.425
All right, let's check 'em out.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.427
Hey.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.463
You and Pride okay?

21:36.496 --> 21:39.466
I want to bring General Matthews
in for questioning, all right?

21:39.499 --> 21:40.867
He disagrees.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.335
Typical politics.

21:42.369 --> 21:45.538
Sounds like you've been
down this road before?

21:45.572 --> 21:47.607
Yeah, I had a case
once with NOPD.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.509
Double homicide.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.011
All right,
high-profile suspect.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.846
Pillar-of-the-community
business type.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.416
Guy had guilt
written all over him.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.452
Our bosses wouldn't
let us touch him.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.953
Afraid of exposure.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.389
Red ball case.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.424
Rules change.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.392
Yeah, we were told

22:05.425 --> 22:08.060
to bide our time.

22:08.094 --> 22:11.464
Three months later,
"pillar" struck again.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.701
Finally able
to put him away

22:14.734 --> 22:17.704
after the third person died.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.572
That victim's on me.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.474
Doesn't work like that.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.477
Yeah, well, you see what I see?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.446
Guy checking pallets?

22:26.479 --> 22:27.814
Been watching us
since we got here?

22:30.750 --> 22:33.119
LASALLE:
NCIS.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.555
May, uh,
we help you, sir?

22:35.588 --> 22:36.956
Uh, hey there.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.157
No.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.392
I'm sorry.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.394
Uh, I guess
I was curious.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.162
You're here about Becca?

22:43.195 --> 22:44.464
I saw you coming
out of her office.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.465
And you are?

22:45.498 --> 22:46.899
Uh, Walt Jeffries.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.901
I have a facilities
contract here.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.537
Look, I work with Becca.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.705
I haven't seen her lately,
getting worried.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.441
It's a Navy matter.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.875
Nothing good, I assume.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.744
All the people going in and
out of her office today.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.479
Someone else was here?

22:59.512 --> 23:00.480
Couple hours ago.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.515
Man in uniform.

23:02.549 --> 23:03.683
Was inside for a while.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.518
Is this the guy
you saw?

23:05.552 --> 23:08.521
Uh, no, not him.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.723
But the guy did have
a military haircut like that.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.459
If that helps.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.561
*

23:14.594 --> 23:16.563
This guy?

23:18.765 --> 23:20.567
We need to talk.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.069
I'm on my way to a meeting.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.170
Gonna be late.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.706
You've been
playing me, Sam.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.208
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.444
You were in
Rebecca's office today.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.448
Well, I was acting
on behalf of CID.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.450
You were covering up
for your boss.

23:37.484 --> 23:40.620
Destroying fingerprints,
his prints, right?

23:40.653 --> 23:43.055
And we're not talking
as friends right now.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.057
Choose your words carefully.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.059
He's my superior officer.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.128
He gives me orders,
I execute them.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.130
You call it following orders,

23:51.163 --> 23:53.232
I call it obstruction
of justice.

23:53.265 --> 23:57.003
Lieutenant Peterson
was poisoned in that office.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.738
You destroyed evidence.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.042
When you were young,

24:03.075 --> 24:05.177
you dreamed of joining the Army,

24:05.211 --> 24:07.246
serving with honor,
distinction.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.116
This isn't who you are.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.952
I don't have the answers
that you want.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.688
I hadn't even heard of Rebecca
Peterson before last night.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.990
I have to bring the general in.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.959
That is not a road
you want to go down.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.561
No choice.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.796
Whatever happened to Rebecca,
he's a part of it.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.198
I'm trying
to protect you, Dwayne.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.200
Believe it or not.

24:28.234 --> 24:31.571
The general is...

24:31.604 --> 24:33.573
he's a force of nature.

24:33.606 --> 24:36.576
Yeah, well...

24:36.609 --> 24:39.178
consider me warned.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.794
Thank you
for coming in, General.

24:56.629 --> 24:57.830
Go ahead and have a seat.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.702
Please.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.813
You told me you hadn't
seen Rebecca in years.

25:15.582 --> 25:18.785
But according
to the hotel staff,

25:18.818 --> 25:21.187
she visited every time
you were in town.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.623
And often late at night.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.260
And you didn't see Rebecca

25:28.294 --> 25:30.763
just in New Orleans.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.665
You met in Miami.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.100
You have a question here?
Because I don't know

25:34.133 --> 25:35.702
where this is leading.
Pattern of behavior.

25:35.735 --> 25:39.171
Secret meetings with
a subordinate female officer.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.339
Your friend's daughter.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.342
Let me be extremely clear.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.179
I wasn't sleeping
with Rebecca Peterson.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.248
Rebecca was poisoned
with arsenic

25:49.281 --> 25:51.584
at her office yesterday morning.

25:51.618 --> 25:54.587
You're not just accusing me of
fraternization but murder, too?

25:54.621 --> 25:56.088
You were there during that time.

25:56.122 --> 25:59.091
That's why you ordered
Colonel Nilsen

25:59.125 --> 26:00.960
to wipe her office
clean of prints.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.629
MATTHEWS: That's quite
a conspiracy you're building.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.731
He already admitted it.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.065
You gonna sell out your own man?

26:07.734 --> 26:09.802
How dare you question
my loyalty.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.804
Loyalty to who?

26:11.838 --> 26:13.239
Colonel Nilsen?

26:13.272 --> 26:15.074
Rebecca's father?

26:15.107 --> 26:17.910
Rebecca?
You have no right to judge us.

26:17.944 --> 26:21.681
Picking through our private
lives, looking for dirt.

26:21.714 --> 26:22.715
You're a trashman.

26:22.749 --> 26:23.916
I'm done here.
Sit down, General.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.685
I don't answer to you.

26:25.718 --> 26:28.688
In this room,
your stars mean nothing.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.689
I'm in charge.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.090
Now sit down.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.938
Let me be clear.

26:45.972 --> 26:49.742
Your career is in my hands.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.978
I got more than enough
to bring you up on charges.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.680
Is that a threat?

26:53.713 --> 26:54.681
No, General.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.883
It's a forgone conclusion.

26:56.916 --> 27:01.020
Unless you tell me why you were
seeing Lieutenant Peterson.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.191
I didn't hurt Becca,
I was helping her.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.661
She'd discovered
a discrepancy at the port,

27:08.695 --> 27:10.663
financial fraud,
millions of dollars.

27:10.697 --> 27:13.733
Something to do with
the contractors she oversaw.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.401
We'd meet.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.403
Talk about the issue.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.338
There was so much
red tape for her.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.107
But you could
cut right through it.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.109
She didn't have clearance
for the documents she needed,

27:23.142 --> 27:25.712
wasn't getting traction
from her superiors.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.714
You gave her access
to classified material?

27:27.747 --> 27:29.015
Sensitive material.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.016
"For official use only."

27:30.049 --> 27:31.017
Nothing illegal.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.418
PRIDE:
But unethical.

27:32.451 --> 27:33.686
MATTHEWS:
Whatever you want to call it.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.087
It helped.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.389
I went by her office
yesterday.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.225
She couldn't talk,
said she'd found something,

27:39.258 --> 27:41.227
something big.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.029
She was going to tell me
at the hotel.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.998
She could have been killed
for what she found out.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.702
Thought the poison
was for me, not Becca.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.804
I need to see those files.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.006
What I did

27:54.040 --> 27:55.775
was to help.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.343
If this comes out...

27:57.376 --> 27:58.711
There'll be repercussions.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.146
And not just for me.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.714
For you, too.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.817
And I assure you

28:04.851 --> 28:06.285
that's no threat,

28:06.318 --> 28:09.455
Special Agent Pride.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.991
That's a forgone conclusion.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.507
LASALLE:
These files the general shared
with Rebecca Peterson,

28:28.540 --> 28:30.342
it's not exactly
the Pentagon Papers.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.745
No. But it's likely Rebecca
was killed over something

28:32.779 --> 28:33.780
inside of them.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.748
Yeah, I can't imagine what.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.750
Background checks
on Navy contractors,

28:37.784 --> 28:40.753
their subcontractors, and
the subcontractors' principles.

28:40.787 --> 28:43.422
Mmm. My head is spinning, too.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.858
That's 'cause
you didn't get any sleep.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.994
What makes you say that?

28:48.027 --> 28:50.096
Well, that's your fourth cup
of coffee this morning,

28:50.129 --> 28:52.098
and you came in
with an energy drink.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.033
I smell you, Nancy Drew.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.501
Happen to have experience
in this area.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.503
It's easier to go out
than to stay at home

28:57.536 --> 28:59.471
thinking about the hard stuff.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.473
Used to be my sweet spot.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.510
I would stay up all night,
stewing over Emily's death.

29:04.543 --> 29:07.213
And now I know
what happened to her, and...

29:07.246 --> 29:09.281
I still can't sleep.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.950
You want to talk
about it?

29:10.983 --> 29:13.419
I know where to find you.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.888
So, are you buying

29:15.922 --> 29:18.524
the general's line that he
and Rebecca were just friends?

29:18.557 --> 29:20.793
Well, I don't know
what to think.

29:20.827 --> 29:23.129
But he stuck his neck out
on the line either way.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.463
He'll be brought up
on charges.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.531
This could be the end
of his career.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.166
Could be the end of ours, too,

29:27.199 --> 29:28.534
just like Pride said.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.902
He and Nilsen are out
takin' a walk,

29:29.936 --> 29:31.370
sussing out damage control.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.872
We've been aboveboard.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.506
Doesn't matter
with men like the general.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.308
He can be vindictive.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.144
Retribution--
that's no bueno.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.545
Totally worth it though.

29:39.578 --> 29:42.514
The way Pride took
him on in there.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.316
Sebastian.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.018
He's excited
about something.

29:46.052 --> 29:49.355
Go. I will take a turn
with these super boring files.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.257
Thank you much.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.592
NILSEN:
I never meant to put you
in a jam, Dwayne.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.527
Whatever happens,

29:55.561 --> 29:57.529
I just... I need you
to know, please,

29:57.563 --> 29:59.531
that I... I never wanted
to play you.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.367
Yeah, but you did.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.536
You put me and my team
in a bad situation.

30:04.570 --> 30:08.540
Well... I had no idea
about the files

30:08.574 --> 30:11.543
or the meetings
with Lieutenant Peterson.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.881
Any chance we can fix it?

30:14.914 --> 30:16.515
Won't be part of a cover-up.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.217
That's not what I meant.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.586
No more stalling
or discretion.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.421
We submit an
official report.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.924
I know. Dwayne,

30:24.957 --> 30:27.393
I know.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.628
I talked to Chief of Staff
this morning.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.864
Told him to expect your call.

30:32.564 --> 30:35.367
There'll be fallout for you.

30:35.401 --> 30:39.371
No matter how this plays out,
man, my days are numbered.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.441
But it's the right thing to do.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.343
That's what matters.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.914
As... someone
recently reminded me.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.283
Whoever that was

30:51.317 --> 30:53.485
sounds wise.
Pride,

30:53.519 --> 30:56.388
I think I found
something.

30:56.422 --> 30:59.391
The files have info
on contractors

30:59.425 --> 31:00.592
that do business
with the Navy.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.028
Tugboat companies,

31:02.061 --> 31:04.530
container suppliers, et cetera.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.532
A handful of these businesses

31:06.565 --> 31:09.535
seem to do nothing at all.
They just exist.

31:09.568 --> 31:10.669
Shell companies?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.238
They all have addresses,

31:12.271 --> 31:15.074
background checks,
but no obvious purpose

31:15.107 --> 31:17.643
except to invoice the Navy
a ton of money.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.211
And where are these
companies located?

31:19.245 --> 31:20.546
The Port of New Orleans,

31:20.579 --> 31:22.081
where Lieutenant Peterson
worked.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.516
Can't be a coincidence.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.552
Let's check 'em out.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.491
NILSEN:
Anything?

31:32.524 --> 31:33.625
Two empty offices.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.627
Third one with
exactly one employee.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.397
Secretary who gets paid
to sit by the phone

31:38.430 --> 31:39.631
and watch a lot of Netflix. You?

31:39.665 --> 31:41.133
Same story.

31:41.167 --> 31:43.435
Bored temps playing
video games.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.471
All these companies
running the same scam.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.273
Well, we find the mastermind,

31:47.306 --> 31:48.640
we find
Lieutenant Peterson's killer.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.109
Where's Brody?

31:50.142 --> 31:53.079
She's got one more
contractor on her list.

31:53.112 --> 31:56.115
Jeffries Consolidated.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.953
Oh, hey.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.588
It's you again.

32:02.621 --> 32:03.622
Walt Jeffries?

32:03.655 --> 32:05.191
I remember.
Friend of Becca's.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.625
You were very
helpful yesterday.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.527
Any, uh, news on her?

32:08.560 --> 32:09.661
That you can share?

32:09.695 --> 32:11.964
Uh, not yet. Hopefully soon.

32:11.998 --> 32:13.165
So you work here?

32:13.199 --> 32:15.134
Jeffries Consolidated.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.668
Warehousing Logistics.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.370
I'm the owner.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.538
Well, technically,

32:19.571 --> 32:20.606
it's Dad's company, but, uh,

32:20.639 --> 32:22.108
he's not doing well.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.375
I'm so sorry.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.111
You have a few minutes to talk?

32:25.144 --> 32:26.145
Of course.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.379
Come on.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.015
I'll show you
to my office.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.482
SEBASTIAN: All right,
so I tested everything

32:30.516 --> 32:31.617
that you brought back

32:31.650 --> 32:33.986
from Rebecca's office--
no arsenic.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.387
Which seemed weird,
until I realized

32:35.421 --> 32:37.489
that if she ingested
most of the poison,

32:37.523 --> 32:39.391
then only minute residue
would remain.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.394
I'm guessing you found
a way to test for that.
Yeah.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.729
Test tube, check.

32:43.762 --> 32:47.766
Add zinc, check.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.702
Add acid, check.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.204
And you have to use water--

32:52.238 --> 32:53.605
it won't work on particles.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.741
So you put everything
we brought you into water?

32:55.774 --> 32:57.743
Like that chewing gum.
Yeah.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.711
It seems low-tech,
but it works.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.548
The mixture
results in gas.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.450
Arsine if
there's arsenic present,

33:04.483 --> 33:05.717
otherwise hydrogen.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.286
Now, you're probably
gonna ask me

33:07.319 --> 33:08.687
how do I know
which gas is which?

33:08.720 --> 33:11.490
Well, I was kind of waiting
for you to tell me that.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.693
All right. Well, what you
do is you ignite the gas.

33:14.726 --> 33:19.265
Then you hold a piece
of glass over it.

33:19.298 --> 33:20.766
Like... so.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.768
When arsenic is present,

33:22.801 --> 33:24.803
you see a silvery-
black deposit.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.338
Kind of like this.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.439
Where's it from?

33:27.473 --> 33:29.308
That is from this.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.043
A coffee pod?

33:31.077 --> 33:32.711
A coffee pod.
Delivered in bulk.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.181
Anyone in Rebecca's
building would've had access.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.150
You just inject arsenic
into the top of the pod,

33:38.184 --> 33:40.519
make sure it finds its way
to the right office and then...

33:40.552 --> 33:43.055
whoever drinks it dies.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.257
So General Matthews
visited Rebecca's office

33:45.291 --> 33:46.758
the morning she died.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.527
Yeah. Which would explain
how he got dosed.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.063
If she made him a cup coffee
after using a poisoned pod,

33:51.097 --> 33:53.499
then traces of arsenic
would've leaked into his drink.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.434
I've seen a lot
of murder weapons.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.104
This one's... pretty genius.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.709
JEFFRIES:
Fresh, hot coffee,

34:03.742 --> 34:06.612
any way you like it, anytime.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.347
It's a lifesaver.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.183
So, uh... warehousing logistics.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.285
Your company
billed the Navy

34:13.319 --> 34:15.687
$800,000 last year.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.090
Lucrative, but boring.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.293
You really can't tell me
what this is about?

34:21.327 --> 34:22.861
Security issue at stake.

34:22.894 --> 34:23.862
Oh, it just... feels very

34:23.895 --> 34:25.631
cloak and dagger, you know?

34:25.664 --> 34:27.399
It's kind
of exciting.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.801
We don't see much of that
in the warehousing game.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.378
Enjoy.
Thank you.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.480
So, about these

34:41.513 --> 34:44.216
specific bills...

34:44.250 --> 34:46.218
Um...

34:47.353 --> 34:49.121
Brody, don't drink that!

35:04.536 --> 35:06.538
*

35:27.359 --> 35:29.261
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good. Go, go!

35:50.249 --> 35:52.184
You all right?

35:52.218 --> 35:54.286
Yeah, I'm good.
Where's Sam?

35:54.320 --> 35:55.687
Here.

35:55.721 --> 35:56.955
I-I saw that move
back there, man.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.390
You still got some jam.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.226
Yeah, more than you.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.627
Someone gonna explain to me
why you karate-chopped

36:01.660 --> 36:03.395
my coffee back there?

36:03.429 --> 36:05.431
You'll thank me later.
Come on.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.902
PRIDE:
Your family's company
has been operating

36:10.936 --> 36:13.639
Navy contracts out of
the port for generations.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.541
BRODY: Accounts started
suffering after you took over,

36:15.574 --> 36:18.644
so I guess you don't have
your dad's head for business.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.479
You got creative--

36:20.512 --> 36:23.515
invented dummy companies
to subcontract from you

36:23.549 --> 36:25.417
and other businesses
at the port.

36:25.451 --> 36:27.419
Charging for services
never rendered.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.255
You stole four million dollars.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.357
That's embezzlement and fraud.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.559
PRIDE:
The coffee you gave Agent Brody

36:33.592 --> 36:35.327
was full of arsenic.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.763
Just like the coffee
that killed Lieutenant Peterson.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.298
First degree murder,

36:39.331 --> 36:40.932
attempted murder.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.501
Thank you.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.742
Last chance
to get ahead of this.

36:50.776 --> 36:51.977
Tell us how you figured out

36:52.010 --> 36:54.280
Lieutenant Peterson
was onto you,

36:54.313 --> 36:56.315
who else was involved,

36:56.348 --> 36:58.284
and we'll do our best
to keep you off death row.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.352
I want a lawyer.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.861
Call the federal marshals.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.697
Have 'em come pick up
Mr. Jeffries.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.932
Can't believe it comes down
this greedy little thief.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.834
You were right
about the general.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.369
Thanks for keeping me
in check, King.

37:17.403 --> 37:18.704
We spur each other on.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.038
Watch each other's backs.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.673
Save each other's lives.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.609
Aw, you're tough.
Little arsenic in your brew

37:23.642 --> 37:25.477
wouldn't have bothered you.

37:25.511 --> 37:26.678
Do you know what
gastrointestinal

37:26.712 --> 37:28.314
decontamination is?

37:28.347 --> 37:29.681
No.
Okay, well,

37:29.715 --> 37:30.849
thanks to your quick call
to Pride,

37:30.882 --> 37:31.983
neither do I.

37:33.552 --> 37:34.720
Oh. Need me at the bar.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.322
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.424
Soon as my would-be killer's
in custody.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.393
LASALLE: Yeah, not this time
for me, King.

37:41.427 --> 37:42.728
Got somewhere to be.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.631
You know where I'll be.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.741
You're back.

37:55.774 --> 37:59.411
I told you I would be.

37:59.445 --> 38:02.514
I'm here to tell you
what happened to Rebecca.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.450
How she died and why.

38:04.483 --> 38:07.052
And I'll stay here
as long as you need

38:07.085 --> 38:10.021
and answer
every question you have.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.559
Give me a hand.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.630
Now, your daughter--

38:18.664 --> 38:21.066
she was a hero.

38:21.099 --> 38:24.503
She knew somebody
was taking money

38:24.536 --> 38:26.505
from the government.
She stuck her neck out...

38:36.948 --> 38:39.651
So, uh, how long are you
gonna keep up this, uh,

38:39.685 --> 38:41.687
side bartending gig?

38:41.720 --> 38:45.090
Well, you want something
done right...

38:45.123 --> 38:47.859
There you go.
Any update on
General Matthews?

38:47.893 --> 38:49.928
There's been
an official inquiry.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.063
Already?
Yeah.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.433
Time-sensitive.
Homeland Security post

38:54.466 --> 38:55.934
needs to be filled ASAP.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.704
So, the general
may still get the job?

38:58.737 --> 39:00.939
Army weighed the gravity
of the offense

39:00.972 --> 39:03.542
against the general's
distinguished record.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.477
Made a judgment call.

39:05.511 --> 39:06.945
Out of my hands.

39:06.978 --> 39:10.081
Nomination's supposed
to be announced tomorrow.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.883
On your tap? Oh.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.455
Ah, Loretta.
Hey, Loretta.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.457
Thought you were supposed
to be joining us tonight.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.125
I'm at the prison.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.761
Your suspect
Walt Jeffries is dead.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.698
You got it.

39:26.732 --> 39:30.502
I'll put you on speaker.
How did Jeffries die?

39:30.536 --> 39:31.637
Could be arsenic.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.605
He poisoned himself?

39:33.639 --> 39:36.875
I won't be able to confirm
timeline until autopsy,

39:36.908 --> 39:40.579
but the guards say Jeffries
wasn't out of their sight

39:40.612 --> 39:42.414
since they took custody.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.115
He must have dosed himself
before we caught him.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.451
It makes no sense.

39:45.484 --> 39:46.818
Why poison me and take off

39:46.852 --> 39:48.487
if he's already a dead man?

39:48.520 --> 39:49.821
That is the question.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.823
I'll let you know what I find.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.525
But I can tell you right now

39:53.559 --> 39:55.894
this doesn't
look like a suicide.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.630
NILSEN:
Pride!

39:58.664 --> 40:00.599
Hey.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.601
You know, if you were unhappy

40:02.634 --> 40:05.070
about the Army's decision,
you could have come to me.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.605
Not the press!

40:06.638 --> 40:08.807
I trusted you!
Whoa, whoa, Sam.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.676
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

40:10.709 --> 40:14.079
The general's nomination's been
put on indefinite hold.

40:14.112 --> 40:15.947
I thought the Army
wasn't pressing charges.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.149
They aren't. Someone leaked

40:18.183 --> 40:20.452
the general's predicament
to the press.

40:20.486 --> 40:21.653
Dead girl
in general's hotel.

40:21.687 --> 40:24.490
It's a real three-star scandal.

40:24.523 --> 40:26.024
None of it's true.
It doesn't matter.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.526
Matthews is done.

40:27.559 --> 40:28.827
Dwayne...

40:28.860 --> 40:30.128
I'm done.

40:30.161 --> 40:32.531
Sam, I'm sorry.

40:32.564 --> 40:34.099
But I had nothing
to do with this.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.468
It doesn't matter
whether that's true or not.

40:36.502 --> 40:39.204
As far as the general's
concerned, the Army--

40:39.237 --> 40:41.439
the leak came from you.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.876
Good luck, Dwayne.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.879
You're gonna need it.
