09:32.975 --> 09:35.675
I recruited her...

09:35.677 --> 09:36.943
I handled her...

09:39.181 --> 09:40.781
...and I buried her.

09:40.783 --> 09:42.182
The Russians unmasked her,

09:42.184 --> 09:44.484
and it was my job to get
her out of the country.

09:44.486 --> 09:46.652
I tried.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.988
I failed.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.192
She paid the price for my mistake.

teaching hundreds of you not
to follow in my footsteps.

Exfiltration is a skill
you'll be called upon to use,

10:02.036 --> 10:03.635
and it is never easy.

For all the effort you make
in... in turning an asset

or worse, when...
something's gone wrong,

10:12.780 --> 10:15.848
is far more dangerous,
but it has to be done

10:15.850 --> 10:19.951

spend the rest of your life...

19:11.541 --> 19:13.775
