WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:08.268
All right, slow down.
Where's your cab?

00:08.442 --> 00:10.637
Yeah, I'm walking out right now.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.678
- No, I don't see you.
- I'm out front.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.279
Gotcha.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.778
- Michael, thank God.
- What's going on? You okay?

00:21.989 --> 00:23.616
Adam wanted me to give this to you.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.452
He said you'd know
what to do with them.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.754
- What is this?
- I haven't opened it.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.262
- Oh, my God. It's those men.
- Jillian, calm down.

00:34.435 --> 00:37.199
- Did Adam tell you anything else?
- No.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.406
- Do you know them?
- Yeah, I know them.

00:42.176 --> 00:45.043
Oh, my God. Michael!

00:51.452 --> 00:53.420
- Run! Run!
- Michael!

01:39.466 --> 01:41.957
- Okay.
- Kensi, don't let him crowd you.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.841
Watch his shoulders.
He's telegraphing.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.208
- Thought you were on my side.
- I don't take sides.

01:55.415 --> 01:56.905
Then stop coaching.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.757
- Okay.
- Circle to his outside.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.221
I thought we were partners.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.554
We are,
but I'm having second thoughts.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.806
It's a tie. Again. Way to go, Kens.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.937
- Thank you.
- Tough girl.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.210
- I went easy on her.
- Uh-huh.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.912
Oh, please.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.114
What's up, Deeks?

02:38.325 --> 02:40.623
Got a shooting
at the Federal Building.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.728
- What are you kids doing in here?
- Training.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.124
For what, Pirate Fest?

02:44.331 --> 02:46.959
Well, you're welcome to challenge
Captain Blye anytime you want.

02:47.134 --> 02:50.228
- She just bested Sam 10 to 3.
- Really?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.132
- Did you go easy on her?
- No.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.330
- Really?
- No.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.440
Kensi? With a knife?

02:57.110 --> 03:00.409
Ow. Oh, my... Aah.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.550
Okay, I'm coming. That really hurt.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.947
The shooting victim
was a State Department employee

03:07.154 --> 03:08.246
named Michael Barnes.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.617
Forty-five years old,
served in the Marines.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.554
He's worked in Intelligence in Iraq
from '03 to '05.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.954
Looks like he transitioned

03:15.128 --> 03:18.564
into a low-security-clearance desk job
at State five years ago.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.596
Not the kind of gig that'd get you shot.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.634
Maybe someone from his past
was after him?

03:23.837 --> 03:27.364
This is the only security footage
I've been able to access.

03:29.109 --> 03:32.943
I'm assuming the shooter was dressed
as a police officer, not really L.A.P. D?

03:33.146 --> 03:35.341
Motorcycle was reported
stolen yesterday.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.278
He was protecting the woman.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.351
Freeze it, right there.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.291
Maybe he left a print
on that barricade.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.824
I'll see what my guys can pull.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.122
That leaves the question,
who's the woman,

03:50.330 --> 03:52.161
and what's in the envelope?

03:52.332 --> 03:54.061
According to his cell-phone activity,

03:54.234 --> 03:57.328
Barnes was talking to a number
listed to Jillian Leigh

03:57.504 --> 03:59.631
right before the shooting.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.740
- Same woman.
- What else do we know about her?

04:03.977 --> 04:06.502
She's a nurse at a cosmetic surgery
center in Beverly Hills.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.613
I got an address on Roxbury.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.025
- No one's here.
- But the front door was open.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.138
Dr. Russell, federal agents.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.359
Clear, Sam.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.901
Found the doctor.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.711
- Deeks.
- Just heard back from Forensics.

05:12.879 --> 05:16.406
The print on the concrete barrier
belongs to a man named Assan Rafiq.

05:16.583 --> 05:20.314
He is a known Somali al Qaeda
member and on the FBI's wanted list.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.885
I'm sending the file.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.920
The only problem is, the photo on file

05:24.091 --> 05:26.719
looks nothing like the shooter
at the Federal Building.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.428
So we got a dead plastic surgeon...

05:31.631 --> 05:34.725
And a shooter
whose prints don't match his face.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.426
He came here
to have facial reconstructive surgery.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.400
Question is, why?

05:52.985 --> 05:54.543
Found the operating-room schedule.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.985
Dr. Russell blocked out surgery times
on days when the clinic was closed.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.987
And I've got a dozen patient files

06:00.159 --> 06:02.992
with no insurance information
or before-and-after photos.

06:03.162 --> 06:07.121
The doctor only saved them on
his hard drive, not the office database.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.366
See if you can match these patients
to the surgery times.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.527
If Assan got his face changed
to avoid detection,

06:12.704 --> 06:14.501
there could be others.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.334
Sam, check this out.

06:17.242 --> 06:20.075
Looks like the woman at the shooting,
Jillian Leigh, married the boss.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.715
- She's still using her maiden name.
- Classic sign of resistance.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.406
Maybe she liked
the last name better.

06:26.218 --> 06:28.743
Trust me, it's a sign.
You know what's weird?

06:28.921 --> 06:30.081
Your views on marriage?

06:31.023 --> 06:33.457
Jillian nearly got killed
delivering that envelope.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.957
What's her connection to Barnes
and the State Department?

06:36.161 --> 06:37.423
I got something.

06:39.064 --> 06:42.056
Four patients off the list came in
after hours for their surgeries.

06:42.234 --> 06:43.861
I've accessed their medical records.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.402
But there are no
before-and-after photos listed.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.540
All within a four-week period.

06:48.707 --> 06:51.175
So it's not just Assan.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.935
This could be a terrorist cell.

06:55.380 --> 06:59.043
How many tummies you have
to tuck to afford a place like this?

06:59.218 --> 07:01.243
Alarm is on.

07:01.453 --> 07:05.583
- I'll call Eric, have him do his thing.
- I think I got it.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.230
- Have you done this before?
- Watch and learn.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.834
Hold that for me, please.

07:18.103 --> 07:19.502
- Aah!
- Oh, my God, Deeks!

07:19.705 --> 07:22.333
Ha, ha. It's not so funny
when someone gets shocked, is it?

07:22.574 --> 07:24.337
That was not very nice.

07:24.943 --> 07:26.638
You're pouting.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.646
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

07:32.284 --> 07:34.809
- We're in.
- Wow. How Lady MacGyver of you.

07:36.788 --> 07:39.256
I hot-wired a Cessna once. Pfft.

07:39.758 --> 07:44.855
Why? Seriously? Why would you need
to hot-wire an airplane?

07:46.365 --> 07:49.334
- Got it.
- Ah, nice.

07:49.801 --> 07:51.598
Oh, wow.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.465
Expensive taste.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.937
I'm guessing Jillian
didn't come home last night.

07:56.141 --> 07:58.336
Nothing seems disturbed.

07:59.177 --> 08:00.974
No kids in the picture.

08:01.179 --> 08:03.773
Heh. Man, that's the way
to do it, huh?

08:03.949 --> 08:09.854
No nannies, no tuition, no braces,
just a whole lot of disposable income.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.819
Jillian left her e-mail account up.

08:13.292 --> 08:18.286
No messages sent since last night.
Nothing unusual in her inbox.

08:18.497 --> 08:21.625
No calls on her cell phone
since the shooting, according to Eric.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.125
She met her friend, Barnes.

08:24.336 --> 08:27.396
He gets killed, she gets shot at.

08:27.639 --> 08:30.301
Killer takes off
with the incriminating envelope.

08:30.475 --> 08:33.342
- That's a rough morning.
- Yes, it is.

08:33.511 --> 08:36.572
- What do you do after that?
- Guilty or not, she's in the wind.

08:37.381 --> 08:40.145
Oh, there it is. L.A. Diet.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.981
Energy drinks, Calogen
and JuvÃ©derm.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.714
Wow.

08:47.225 --> 08:49.489
Looks like they're affiliated
with the Malibu Medi-Spa.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.719
What's that?

08:50.896 --> 08:54.696
The most exclusive inpatient post-op
surgery center where privacy

08:54.866 --> 08:57.733
and discretion
are of the utmost importance.

09:01.206 --> 09:03.674
- Or so it says.
- Right.

09:03.842 --> 09:06.868
They've even got an anti-paparazzi
helicopter tent.

09:07.045 --> 09:08.410
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:10.615 --> 09:12.014
That's a good place to hide out.

09:13.852 --> 09:16.685
Eric, surveillance cameras
at Dr. Russell's building.

09:16.888 --> 09:18.287
Check these dates and times.

09:18.457 --> 09:22.188
See if we can't catch these guys
heading in for their surgeries.

09:22.394 --> 09:24.021
Russell's calendar.

09:24.229 --> 09:28.563
Nothing unusual this week.
Car appointment for his Mercedes.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.462
Out-of-town wedding in Sonoma.

09:30.702 --> 09:34.399
What's this?
"G.D.," 2 p.m., November 3rd.

09:34.606 --> 09:37.200
- Someone's initials.
- Maybe.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.401
All the other appointments
list the full names.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.603
I'll run a vector
with Dr. Russell's address book

09:41.780 --> 09:43.543
and phone records,
see if anything matches.

09:43.715 --> 09:46.240
I'll also see if anything comes up
on his wife's laptop.

09:46.451 --> 09:48.214
Look for any connections
to Michael Barnes.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.356
We need to find out why Jillian
was taking that envelope to him.

09:51.990 --> 09:54.788
- You think Jillian's hiding something?
- I think she's scared.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.258
She saw a cop kill a friend
and try to shoot her.

09:57.429 --> 09:59.056
I don't blame her for laying low.

10:09.007 --> 10:11.100
- Wow.
- Thank you.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.243
I'm your manager.
You were in a boy band.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.678
You need some work done
before making your big comeback.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.683
I was a magician's assistant
last time, so no.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.853
Why don't we show our badges
and search the place?

10:22.020 --> 10:24.853
Are you kidding? Jillian is a flight risk.
We can't take any chances.

10:25.023 --> 10:27.491
She's probably got friends in there
hiding her out.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.422
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

10:34.599 --> 10:36.123
Hi, I'm Kenley Banks,
and this here...

10:36.301 --> 10:39.793
Her manager. I am her manager.
I am Danny Collins.

10:40.005 --> 10:42.337
This is my client, Kenley,
or as I like to call her, Kiki.

10:42.507 --> 10:45.135
You may recognize her
from the girl band The Panther Girls,

10:45.343 --> 10:48.039
otherwise known in Colombia
as Las Chicas Panteras.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.043
They're huge down there.
Big audience.

10:50.215 --> 10:52.012
And we hear
that you're the very best,

10:52.217 --> 10:55.186
and also private, and we don't need
anybody tweeting about her upgrades.

10:55.353 --> 10:56.411
Oh, absolutely not.

10:56.621 --> 10:58.282
We're gonna need the works,
though, yeah?

10:58.490 --> 11:00.788
A booty lift, tummy tuck,
micro-lipo to the hips-o.

11:00.992 --> 11:02.550
Basically,
we're gonna need a overhaul

11:02.727 --> 11:06.128
- to the whole undercarriage here.
- Heh.

11:06.731 --> 11:09.564
- Of course.
- And then we'll deal with the head.

11:09.734 --> 11:11.326
And we'll do the nose. Again.

11:11.503 --> 11:13.801
You know, hopefully,
they'll get it right this time.

11:13.972 --> 11:16.941
And then these little guys, those
little guys there. What's that? Huh?

11:17.142 --> 11:19.474
Oh, it's Dumbo,
and he's calling because he can't fly

11:19.644 --> 11:21.236
without his ears,
so he wants them back.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.478
Let me see
what I can do about a tour.

11:24.649 --> 11:25.707
Great. Thank you.

11:31.022 --> 11:34.253
- "Micro-lipo on the hips-o"?
- I was just being creative.

11:34.459 --> 11:36.259
- I didn't even say anything about...
- Don't.

11:36.461 --> 11:38.725
- What? I didn't say anything.
- Stop it. Just stop it.

11:38.897 --> 11:40.023
- Don't even...
- Aah!

11:40.198 --> 11:42.564
This is Lisa.
She's going to be showing you around.

11:42.767 --> 11:43.825
Hi, Lisa.

11:44.002 --> 11:46.266
- Hi.
- That's great.

11:48.006 --> 11:51.203
I accessed the camera footage from
the hallway in Russell's office building

11:51.376 --> 11:53.537
and matched it up
with those after-hour surgery times

11:53.712 --> 11:57.614
from about three weeks ago.
You won't believe what I got.

11:57.849 --> 12:02.013
Meet Masood Davi,
Fowad Zachari, Abdul Talwar,

12:02.220 --> 12:04.882
and our old friend Assan Rafiq.

12:05.090 --> 12:08.287
All members of the Mogadishu-based
terror cell The Chutanis.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.017
Chutani means "devil" in Arabic.

12:10.228 --> 12:13.026
They're on the FBI's wanted list
for murder, money laundering,

12:13.198 --> 12:14.859
extortion, among other things.

12:15.066 --> 12:18.229
Yeah. But these are their old faces.

12:18.436 --> 12:20.996
Aside from Assan, we have no idea
what they look like now.

12:21.206 --> 12:23.401
There's one person that does.

12:24.509 --> 12:26.067
Jillian.

12:31.249 --> 12:33.649
This is the relaxation center.

12:33.818 --> 12:36.878
All of our meals are catered
by the Beverly Hills Culinary Institute.

12:37.055 --> 12:40.081
They developed
a very special liquid diet for us.

12:40.258 --> 12:43.227
Kiki here loves liquid diet, don't...?

12:44.596 --> 12:46.086
Over here
we have our mineral baths.

12:46.264 --> 12:49.791
We import all of our water
from the French Alps.

12:54.072 --> 12:58.133
- Hey, so, what's over there?
- Oh, that's our private wing.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.834
Only VIP patients
and doctors allowed.

13:00.078 --> 13:01.978
Oh, hey, listen,
I should probably take this.

13:02.147 --> 13:04.342
This is her publicist,
and she goes positively bananas

13:04.549 --> 13:06.244
when I screen her calls.

13:06.451 --> 13:08.078
We don't allow cell phones
in this area.

13:08.253 --> 13:09.618
It's okay. I'll catch up, Kiki.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.653
- Yeah, go, yeah.
- I'll go grab this.

13:11.823 --> 13:14.348
Hey, babe. Listen,
so we just wanted to let you know

13:14.559 --> 13:18.086
that the plan here with the photo shoot
with the baby...

13:20.799 --> 13:23.768
Oh! Hey. Aah. I'm so... I'm so sorry.

13:23.935 --> 13:25.495
- I'm not even looking. I just...
- Hey.

13:25.670 --> 13:27.467
Oh! No, no, no. I'm not looking.

13:27.672 --> 13:29.640
- I'm a police officer, so...
- You're a pervert.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.776
No, I'm actually not a pervert.
I'm just...

13:31.943 --> 13:33.376
- Security!
- Come on!

13:37.716 --> 13:39.877
Is that pepper spray?

13:41.386 --> 13:43.149
- Kensi?
- What?

13:43.321 --> 13:45.016
Kensi?

13:56.900 --> 14:00.961
There's been a big spike in chatter
related to Assan Rafiq's cell.

14:01.138 --> 14:02.571
Any specifics?

14:02.739 --> 14:04.798
Not yet,
but often a spike like this happens

14:05.008 --> 14:07.272
just before they go operational.

14:07.511 --> 14:09.035
A target and a timeline would help.

14:09.246 --> 14:12.238
Terrorists often choose a specific date
to help sell their message.

14:12.816 --> 14:15.046
Mm. Like 9/11.

14:15.218 --> 14:18.051
Theorists believe that bin Laden chose
the date to commemorate the day

14:18.221 --> 14:20.951
when 20,000 Muslims
were killed in 1697.

14:21.124 --> 14:24.093
Nell, see what you can pull up
about the Chutani group,

14:24.261 --> 14:27.094
any dates of historical significance.

14:27.297 --> 14:29.128
Whatever they're planning
has gotta be big,

14:29.299 --> 14:31.631
otherwise they wouldn't have gone
to all this trouble.

14:31.802 --> 14:33.463
Ooh. Got something here.

14:33.637 --> 14:36.401
Five years ago,
NATO forces took out their leader,

14:36.573 --> 14:38.564
Abib Chutani, in a bomb attack.

14:38.775 --> 14:42.336
- On what date?
- October 26th.

14:42.546 --> 14:44.343
- Which would be...
- Today.

14:49.653 --> 14:50.677
I'm mixing it up.

14:52.622 --> 14:54.146
I think I found something.

14:55.459 --> 14:58.360
I guess I'll see
if anything's come up on Jillian.

14:59.696 --> 15:02.529
I think I'll give Director Vance
the heads-up.

15:02.699 --> 15:06.100
If this terrorist cell is activating,

15:06.269 --> 15:09.466
Los Angeles
may not be the only target.

15:10.307 --> 15:12.775
This is Bert Hindley.

15:12.943 --> 15:15.503
L.A.P.D. Interviewed the parking
attendant on duty this morning

15:15.679 --> 15:17.510
at Dr. Russell's office building.

15:17.681 --> 15:20.445
He remembers seeing
a silver Escalade with a surf rack

15:20.617 --> 15:22.107
leaving around the time
of the murder.

15:22.319 --> 15:25.288
There's gotta be more than one
silver Escalade with a surf rack in L.A.

15:25.455 --> 15:28.856
Dozens. But it was his bumper stickers
that really sealed the deal.

15:29.626 --> 15:32.527
He picked up his third DUI last month.
He's currently serving time.

15:32.696 --> 15:34.891
He sold his wheels on Craigslist
before he went in.

15:35.098 --> 15:37.089
You got the new owner's name
or address?

15:37.300 --> 15:40.326
DMV hasn't updated its records,
but I've got an IP address

15:40.504 --> 15:42.699
that the buyer used on Craigslist,

15:42.873 --> 15:48.869
so the guy's address
is 650 Flower Street, downtown.

15:49.045 --> 15:50.239
Unit number?

15:50.480 --> 15:52.311
Not yet, but...

15:54.417 --> 15:57.818
Oh, come on, there's like ten people in
the country that could've done this.

15:58.021 --> 16:00.046
- Ten, huh?
- Can you get us their names?

16:00.257 --> 16:02.248
Maybe one of them
could get us the unit number.

16:02.492 --> 16:06.189
- You know, that hurts.
- Hold this, Eric.

16:06.930 --> 16:10.229
I'll get you that bumper-sticker vector
when you get back.

16:10.433 --> 16:12.697
And I will text you that unit number.

16:15.338 --> 16:17.135
I got it.

16:17.908 --> 16:20.399
- What happened to you?
- I got peppered.

16:20.577 --> 16:24.069
- Peppered? Heh. Any luck with Jillian?
- Yeah, yeah. I found her.

16:24.247 --> 16:26.374
- He lost her.
- Don't wanna talk about it.

16:26.550 --> 16:30.509
He left a trail of angry,
violated women in Malibu.

16:30.687 --> 16:33.155
Gloria Allred might be calling,
just so you know.

16:33.356 --> 16:37.554
- That was a gross exaggeration.
- "Peppered."

16:38.094 --> 16:39.391
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.531
Just got a hit off Jillian's ATM card.

16:41.698 --> 16:45.759
She used it at a rest stop
off the I-5 South in Irvine.

16:45.936 --> 16:47.801
Ooh. Pepper spray.

16:47.971 --> 16:49.871
- He doesn't wanna talk about it.
- I don't.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.031
- See who she knows in the area.
- On it.

16:52.209 --> 16:55.110
I'm data-mining through her school
records, address book, e-mails,

16:55.278 --> 16:56.939
phone calls,
and calendar appointments.

16:57.113 --> 16:58.273
If there's anyone in the area

16:58.448 --> 17:01.440
that Jillian's had any contact with,
this will pick it up.

17:01.618 --> 17:03.449
This doesn't make any sense.

17:03.620 --> 17:06.748
Why would a successful surgeon
get involved with these terrorists?

17:06.923 --> 17:07.981
Well, you saw their place.

17:08.191 --> 17:10.386
Maybe he needs some extra cashola
for another Picasso.

17:11.761 --> 17:15.821
Okay, looks like our winner
is David Fernandez,

17:15.999 --> 17:18.934
registered nurse
at St. Mary's Hospital. Uh...

17:19.102 --> 17:22.765
Lives two miles off the exit she was at.
Address is 465 Sheridan Road.

17:22.939 --> 17:23.963
Got it.

17:24.140 --> 17:27.473
Oh. And I figured out what "G.D."
Stands for in Dr. Russell's calendar.

17:27.644 --> 17:31.080
Dr. Georgia Donner.
She's an ob-gyn at Cedars.

17:31.248 --> 17:34.115
Wow. I don't know too many guys
that visit a gynaecologist.

17:34.284 --> 17:36.115
The fact that you actually know any
scares me.

17:36.286 --> 17:38.948
Maybe he went with his wife.
Maybe Jillian is preggers.

17:39.122 --> 17:40.248
You really are a detective.

17:40.423 --> 17:42.118
Okay,
now you're just making fun of me.

17:42.292 --> 17:44.760
Eric came through. It's unit 1231.

17:47.330 --> 17:50.163
I don't get the whole loft craze.
If I buy a place, I want walls.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.858
I like the open-floor plan.
You know where everything's at.

17:53.036 --> 17:54.298
You know where everything's at

17:54.471 --> 17:56.632
because all you own is a sleeping bag
and toothbrush.

17:56.806 --> 17:59.604
And I got a roof over my head.
What more do I need?

17:59.776 --> 18:03.212
A sweet plasma, for one.
Microwave, bookshelves.

18:03.380 --> 18:05.007
Then I gotta buy books.

18:06.683 --> 18:07.707
That's how it starts.

18:07.884 --> 18:12.344
First you buy paperbacks. A fridge,
a bed. Just kind of snowballs on you.

18:16.159 --> 18:18.491
Something tells me
they don't like visitors.

18:21.164 --> 18:23.894
You know what else
paranoid people don't like?

18:30.473 --> 18:32.907
Please proceed to the nearest stairwell.

18:33.076 --> 18:34.543
Do not take the elevators.

18:35.812 --> 18:37.746
Please proceed
to the nearest stairwell.

18:37.914 --> 18:40.212
Do not take the elevators.

18:40.917 --> 18:43.181
Please proceed
to the nearest stairwell.

18:43.386 --> 18:44.546
Federal agent. Stop.

18:48.191 --> 18:49.556
On him.

19:20.623 --> 19:22.523
Federal agent. That's far enough.

19:23.526 --> 19:25.585
Don't even think about it.

19:29.866 --> 19:31.128
Come back in, man.

19:35.705 --> 19:37.195
You don't wanna do this.

19:46.149 --> 19:47.446
It's not worth it.

20:22.116 --> 20:25.483
Anti-anxiety meds,
tranquilisers, sleeping pills.

20:25.687 --> 20:27.086
All the labels ripped off.

20:27.255 --> 20:29.780
Well, it's a high-stress job
being a terrorist.

20:29.958 --> 20:31.550
Never know
when your shoe might blow up

20:31.726 --> 20:34.695
or you gotta drive your pickup
into a hotel foyer.

20:39.567 --> 20:41.967
No sign of the envelope
from the Federal Building.

20:44.772 --> 20:46.137
You were a mathlete.

20:48.610 --> 20:50.840
Junior Math Olympian.
It's a big difference.

20:51.012 --> 20:52.309
We don't wear the jackets.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.211
Some sort of code,
for a safe, lockbox.

20:58.753 --> 21:00.448
One for Nell.

21:00.855 --> 21:02.516
It's a tourist map of Long Beach.

21:02.757 --> 21:05.521
I doubt they were buying souvenirs
to bring back to Somalia.

21:05.727 --> 21:08.719
The routes all along the waterfront
are highlighted.

21:09.264 --> 21:10.856
So we got a dead al Qaeda member,

21:11.032 --> 21:14.024
a dead former intelligence agent,
a dead plastic surgeon...

21:14.269 --> 21:16.669
And three terrorists
with new faces on the loose.

21:16.871 --> 21:20.500
The one person who can ID them
is doing her best to disappear.

21:22.277 --> 21:24.370
Okay, so let's assume their target
is in Long Beach.

21:24.545 --> 21:26.877
- We don't know where.
- We don't know when.

21:29.384 --> 21:31.045
Yes, we do.

21:32.253 --> 21:33.652
Travel itinerary.

21:33.855 --> 21:36.483
Four seats booked to Jakarta,
departing from LAX.

21:36.658 --> 21:38.990
- When?
- Tonight.

21:43.698 --> 21:44.858
It's a pretty serious hobby.

21:45.033 --> 21:47.467
Heh. It takes my mind off things.

21:47.635 --> 21:50.627
Some people do yoga,
I stuff animals.

21:50.838 --> 21:52.772
Thank you.

21:52.974 --> 21:54.908
You and Jillian worked together
at St. Mary's?

21:55.076 --> 21:56.543
Six years.

21:56.711 --> 21:58.474
It was her first job
out of nursing school.

21:58.646 --> 21:59.704
I was her supervisor.

21:59.914 --> 22:01.142
Is she in trouble?

22:01.349 --> 22:03.476
Right now we just wanna ask her
some questions.

22:04.552 --> 22:07.521
I wish I could help, but it's been
a while since we've talked.

22:07.689 --> 22:09.850
Can you remember the last time
you spoke on the phone

22:10.024 --> 22:11.252
or saw each other?

22:11.426 --> 22:13.155
I was at her wedding two years ago,

22:13.361 --> 22:15.829
and she sent me a card
for my birthday back in April.

22:15.997 --> 22:17.089
We talked around then.

22:17.332 --> 22:18.890
You spend much time
with Dr. Russell?

22:19.100 --> 22:21.034
I only met him a few times,

22:21.235 --> 22:24.398
but Adam's a great guy,
really generous.

22:24.572 --> 22:27.700
We were so happy for Jillian
when they started seeing each other.

22:27.875 --> 22:29.604
"We"? Are you married?

22:30.578 --> 22:33.342
Was. Divorced a year next month.

22:33.514 --> 22:35.379
Oh. Girlfriend?

22:35.550 --> 22:37.074
Working on it.

22:37.251 --> 22:42.314
Started online dating, but "male nurse
seeks woman who loves taxidermy"

22:42.523 --> 22:44.388
- isn't really luring the ladies.
- Ha, ha.

22:44.559 --> 22:46.959
That's their loss, man,
because that's a sweet raccoon.

22:47.195 --> 22:49.755
Anyway,
thank you so much for your time.

22:49.964 --> 22:53.730
- Sorry I couldn't have been more help.
- No problem. We have to go.

22:53.901 --> 22:57.064
- We have to go.
- Okay.

22:57.605 --> 22:58.867
Bye.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.268
Okay, that guy was awesome. What?

23:02.443 --> 23:04.035
Ginger ale
and crackers on the counter.

23:04.212 --> 23:06.703
Foods you eat when you're nauseated
in your first trimester.

23:06.881 --> 23:09.543
Or foods you eat if you like ginger ale
and crackers, which I do.

23:09.717 --> 23:13.380
- Oh, my God. What if I'm pregnant?
- Take one of these.

23:13.554 --> 23:16.250
Prenatal vitamins?
I hear they're good for your hair.

23:16.424 --> 23:19.257
Yeah. You stake out the front
of the house, I'll take the back.

23:19.427 --> 23:21.054
Heads up.

23:41.816 --> 23:43.511
Jillian, stop!

23:46.320 --> 23:48.948
Jillian, stop.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.886
Jillian!

23:52.126 --> 23:53.320
We're federal agents.

23:54.595 --> 23:56.426
I wanna speak to my husband.

23:57.298 --> 24:00.825
I'm sorry. Your husband was shot
and killed this morning in his office.

24:03.671 --> 24:05.263
No.

24:07.642 --> 24:09.109
No.

24:09.777 --> 24:11.335
We're really sorry.

24:16.050 --> 24:19.417
- You always this stubborn?
- Only when I know I'm right.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.020
What makes you sure
this won't work?

24:29.163 --> 24:31.063
Is everything copasetic here?

24:31.299 --> 24:33.699
Yes, absolutely.

24:33.868 --> 24:36.894
We're working on the code
from the terrorist safe house.

24:37.071 --> 24:39.471
- Mm, sort of working.
- Difference of methodologies.

24:39.674 --> 24:42.507
I'm of the "let's run it through our
code-decryption programs" camp.

24:42.677 --> 24:45.009
- And she's...
- Of the "let's not limit ourselves

24:45.179 --> 24:47.579
to assuming it's a code" camp.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.718
Both viewpoints are valid.

24:51.953 --> 24:54.547
Perhaps you should divide
and conquer.

24:54.722 --> 24:56.952
See where you end up.

25:01.162 --> 25:05.326
You divide, and, uh, I'll conquer.

25:16.377 --> 25:18.038
It's decaf.

25:22.116 --> 25:25.381
Jillian, now, I know you've been
going through a lot,

25:25.553 --> 25:27.612
but we need to ask you
some questions, okay?

25:32.059 --> 25:34.550
Do you have any idea
who was after your husband?

25:39.600 --> 25:41.966
I know you're scared,

25:42.136 --> 25:44.195
but we're on your side.

25:44.372 --> 25:46.363
You have to trust us.

25:54.382 --> 25:56.316
We don't have time to win her over.

25:56.551 --> 25:58.382
You sure you don't want me to go?

26:01.222 --> 26:02.814
You can be a little intimidating.

26:03.457 --> 26:06.949
I have more in common with her
than you, or Kensi.

26:18.773 --> 26:19.797
Okay.

26:25.246 --> 26:29.444
Jillian, I'm Special Agent Sam Hanna.

26:36.490 --> 26:38.048
I'm sorry for your loss.

26:41.262 --> 26:44.060
We're gonna do everything we can
to make sure you're safe.

26:44.799 --> 26:46.460
How?

26:47.201 --> 26:49.192
Those men know what I look like.

26:49.437 --> 26:52.998
Which is why we need you to answer
a few questions so we can find them.

26:57.311 --> 27:00.576
Look, I know you're not just worried
for your own safety.

27:01.983 --> 27:05.384
We're not gonna let them get to you
or your baby, I promise.

27:08.289 --> 27:12.089
Hey, I have kids too. I understand.
You just wanna protect them.

27:15.363 --> 27:17.797
"Kids"? Plural?

27:17.965 --> 27:20.024
- You knew this?
- Yep.

27:21.402 --> 27:24.701
So, what's the story?
What's the story? That's it?

27:25.973 --> 27:27.372
First time my daughter ate cereal,

27:27.541 --> 27:29.475
I stood there waiting
to give her the Heimlich.

27:29.644 --> 27:32.545
A few years later, when she took
the school bus for the first time,

27:32.713 --> 27:34.340
I tailed it every day for a month.

27:49.196 --> 27:50.527
Um...

27:52.033 --> 27:54.194
Adam and I drove in to work
early this morning

27:54.368 --> 27:56.199
to catch up on some paperwork.

27:57.004 --> 27:59.234
We don't see patients on Tuesdays.

28:00.007 --> 28:06.139
I was in my office when,
all of a sudden, he came rushing in.

28:06.580 --> 28:08.605
I'd never seen him
look that way before.

28:08.783 --> 28:12.514
He was afraid.

28:14.255 --> 28:15.688
Helpless.

28:15.890 --> 28:18.950
He said that he was in trouble,
and he needed me to take something

28:19.160 --> 28:21.287
to our friend Michael
at the State Department.

28:21.529 --> 28:23.190
Michael was a mutual friend?

28:23.364 --> 28:26.856
He was Adam's best friend
since childhood.

28:27.702 --> 28:31.536
Michael had a hard time
after he came back from Iraq,

28:31.706 --> 28:34.573
and my husband was one of the only
people he confided in.

28:35.576 --> 28:38.477
Did your husband say anything else
before he left?

28:39.980 --> 28:42.380
He said he would explain
everything later.

28:44.118 --> 28:46.109
And that he loved me.

28:52.693 --> 28:55.321
We were supposed to meet up
in Westwood after I met with Michael,

28:55.496 --> 28:57.054
but he never showed up,

28:57.231 --> 29:01.292
and he made me swear
not to contact him or to go home.

29:01.469 --> 29:03.460
So I drove out to Malibu.

29:04.905 --> 29:06.770
Did you know
what was in the envelope?

29:08.743 --> 29:12.941
Not until Michael opened it
and I saw the photos.

29:13.114 --> 29:15.014
They were all patients.

29:15.583 --> 29:16.641
Four of them had come in

29:16.817 --> 29:20.446
for major reconstructive work
on their faces.

29:21.088 --> 29:25.457
Adam said
they were businessmen from Egypt.

29:26.327 --> 29:27.817
When was the last
procedure performed?

29:29.096 --> 29:31.587
Maybe three weeks ago.

29:31.766 --> 29:34.667
I assisted on all the surgeries.

29:34.835 --> 29:37.827
The men came in for their final
checkups a few days ago.

29:39.273 --> 29:42.265
I should have realized
something wasn't right.

29:42.810 --> 29:45.802
Adam wasn't the same
after they left.

29:47.248 --> 29:50.775
My husband never wanted me
to worry about anything.

29:53.687 --> 29:57.054
But I could see on his face he was...

29:58.192 --> 29:59.887
He was scared about something.

30:02.329 --> 30:05.059
You think they forced him
to perform the surgeries?

30:05.266 --> 30:07.632
It's the only way
he would have done it.

30:07.802 --> 30:11.568
They must have threatened us,
and he kept it a secret to protect me.

30:14.708 --> 30:20.510
If I just would have realized,
if I just would have said something,

30:21.282 --> 30:25.343
maybe Adam and Michael
would both still be alive.

30:28.722 --> 30:31.247
We're gonna keep you
in protective custody

30:31.425 --> 30:33.859
until we can make sure
you'll be safe.

30:34.061 --> 30:35.790
Okay?

30:46.507 --> 30:48.737
How's the dividing
and conquering going?

30:49.743 --> 30:51.870
So far, it's just a lot of dividing
and multiplying.

30:52.046 --> 30:54.913
I've tried every mathematical model,
logarithm and vector.

30:55.082 --> 30:57.448
And I've been tracking
the terrorist data footprint:

30:57.618 --> 31:00.587
Car travel, phone calls, ATM use.

31:00.754 --> 31:03.917
The town that keeps popping up
is Signal Hill.

31:04.124 --> 31:07.184
So I drilled down using the first part
of the code from the safe house.

31:07.361 --> 31:11.263
Jones & Brothers Storage.

31:11.432 --> 31:14.060
It's the largest self-storage facility
in Southern California.

31:18.339 --> 31:20.398
Storage facility.

31:21.976 --> 31:23.739
Wait a second.

31:26.580 --> 31:30.482
W257 refers to West 257 Street.

31:30.718 --> 31:35.246
B19 is Building 19.

31:35.456 --> 31:39.825
R7 is Row 7. U5 is Unit 5.

31:39.994 --> 31:41.985
Right, which makes
the last four numbers...

31:42.162 --> 31:44.460
The security code on the door.

31:44.965 --> 31:47.229
Let's look at the records.

31:47.401 --> 31:50.632
It says here that it was rented out
about three months ago,

31:50.804 --> 31:52.999
which is around the time
we think these men

31:53.173 --> 31:54.902
came to get their facial surgeries.

31:58.479 --> 32:01.573
Just think of how much sooner
you might have figured this out

32:01.749 --> 32:05.241
if you'd actually been working
together.

32:20.935 --> 32:23.130
Looks like they left in a hurry.

32:24.038 --> 32:26.165
Dimethyl methylphosphonate,

32:26.340 --> 32:30.504
phosphorus trichloride,
sodium fluoride.

32:30.711 --> 32:33.145
Everything you need
to make sarin gas.

32:33.847 --> 32:36.839
Judging from the empty bottles,
the gas tanks...

32:37.818 --> 32:39.479
Enough to kill thousands.

32:52.398 --> 32:53.888
We know they plan
on using sarin gas.

32:54.066 --> 32:55.897
Now, it works best
in contained environments.

32:56.068 --> 32:58.400
- Start with indoor venues.
- They had maps of Long Beach

32:58.571 --> 33:00.971
- in the safe house.
- There are three major indoor events

33:01.140 --> 33:03.370
- going on tonight.
- We've got a car show

33:03.542 --> 33:05.476
at the Long Beach Event Center
near the airport,

33:05.644 --> 33:07.908
a Bob Fosse tribute
at the Performing Arts Center,

33:08.080 --> 33:11.277
and a food and wine festival
at the Grand Belmont Hotel.

33:11.484 --> 33:12.951
No, none of those are on the coast.

33:13.119 --> 33:15.280
They had waterfront routes
highlighted.

33:15.488 --> 33:17.479
They went to the trouble
of changing their faces.

33:17.656 --> 33:20.056
They're not going after a car show
or a food festival.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.284
They've gotta be planning
something way bigger.

33:22.461 --> 33:24.895
Somewhere with facial-recognition
cameras set up.

33:25.097 --> 33:26.962
Look at where cameras are
along the water.

33:27.133 --> 33:29.158
- Nell, start with the marina.
- Okay.

33:29.368 --> 33:31.131
Where are the other checkpoints?

33:31.303 --> 33:34.898
Since 9/11, all the ports and docks,
major hotels, the aquarium.

33:35.107 --> 33:38.770
Nell, anything going on offshore?

33:38.978 --> 33:41.674
Got it. It's the Queen Mary.
She's docked,

33:41.881 --> 33:44.679
but you have to go through
a facial-recognition checkpoint.

33:44.884 --> 33:46.374
There's a black-tie ball going on

33:46.585 --> 33:48.951
for the Planet Advocate Alliance
tonight at 1800.

33:49.155 --> 33:51.783
Huge guest list of VIPs.
The governor will be in attendance,

33:51.957 --> 33:54.949
foreign dignitaries,
bunch of Hollywood celebs.

33:55.161 --> 33:57.152
All the news crews
will be covering this.

33:57.329 --> 34:01.459
Hmm, cocktails and a VIP tour
of the ship started 15 minutes ago.

34:01.667 --> 34:04.966
We evacuate now,
it'll force their hand.

34:05.137 --> 34:06.195
They'll launch an attack.

34:06.439 --> 34:10.375
Assan and his men
have to believe it's business as usual.

34:10.543 --> 34:12.135
We've got no other choice.

34:12.344 --> 34:15.335
If we can't rely
on facial-recognition software,

34:15.514 --> 34:19.348
we'll just have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

34:24.422 --> 34:26.857
Let's keep it moving.
Come on through.

34:45.978 --> 34:47.809
To the camera, please.

34:55.087 --> 34:58.818
Ready, Sam.
Time for Jillian to do her thing.

35:12.671 --> 35:14.696
Lot of people in here.

35:14.874 --> 35:17.069
Five hundred, at least.

35:25.751 --> 35:27.776
We know what Assan looks like,

35:28.020 --> 35:30.352
and one of the other terrorists
who had surgery is dead.

35:30.523 --> 35:32.718
We only need you
to identify two men.

35:32.892 --> 35:36.089
You're the only one who's seen them
after their surgeries.

35:37.062 --> 35:38.086
Okay?

35:40.132 --> 35:41.224
Wait, maybe him.

35:44.203 --> 35:46.068
Where did he go?

35:47.740 --> 35:50.072
Eric, we've got a blind spot
over here.

35:50.242 --> 35:51.402
It's the best we can do.

35:51.577 --> 35:54.239
There's about ten feet of dead space
between the two cameras.

35:59.818 --> 36:01.251
There.

36:06.625 --> 36:09.788
No. No, it's not him.
I'm sorry. There's too many people.

36:10.029 --> 36:14.932
It's okay. It's okay.
Just take your time. Okay?

36:20.306 --> 36:22.467
Jillian. Jillian.

36:22.641 --> 36:25.610
Focus on one monitor.

36:25.778 --> 36:27.575
One monitor.

36:31.050 --> 36:35.817
This chemical,
it would kill all these people?

36:45.164 --> 36:46.461
Take me onboard.

36:49.134 --> 36:52.501
G, I'm coming in with Jillian.

36:52.972 --> 36:54.564
Yeah, yeah.

37:05.084 --> 37:07.712
Guy by the stage taking pictures.

37:08.654 --> 37:11.384
Guy next to the stage
with the camera.

37:14.860 --> 37:17.021
No, he's not one of them.

37:17.196 --> 37:18.823
Negative.

37:22.968 --> 37:25.163
There. The waiter.

37:27.339 --> 37:30.331
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

37:30.976 --> 37:34.207
We got eyes on a suspect
at my 5 o'clock dressed like a waiter.

37:39.551 --> 37:41.314
I'm on him.

37:44.023 --> 37:46.355
The man with the shaved head
on the cell.

37:46.525 --> 37:47.753
Deeks, we got confirmation

37:47.926 --> 37:49.757
on the man on the phone
headed to the kitchen.

37:49.928 --> 37:51.418
Got it.

38:09.214 --> 38:12.274
Eric, I need a layout of the ship.
Where are we headed?

38:12.518 --> 38:14.918
Accessing your location.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.055
All right, you're on the 09 Deck.

38:17.222 --> 38:19.520
Engine room
and vent systems up ahead.

38:46.251 --> 38:48.242
- Do it now.
- Sam.

38:48.454 --> 38:50.081
Open the valve.

38:50.289 --> 38:53.087
Kensi, Assan, south exit.

38:55.094 --> 38:56.925
I got him. Stay with Jillian.

38:57.096 --> 39:00.224
- Hey.
- Excuse me. Sir, excuse me.

39:00.399 --> 39:02.094
Sorry.

39:09.508 --> 39:11.169
Callen, we got two dead
security officers

39:11.343 --> 39:13.334
outside the ventilation room.

39:24.790 --> 39:26.758
Federal agent! Freeze!

39:39.171 --> 39:40.661
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

39:40.839 --> 39:42.830
I got this. Go.

40:00.526 --> 40:03.689
Federal agent. Get down.
Guys, I lost him.

40:44.236 --> 40:47.364
I mean, is it just me,
or do I look really good in this?

40:47.539 --> 40:48.563
It's just you.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.537
I hate to admit it,
but you boys look sharp.

40:50.709 --> 40:53.109
- Right?
- Hetty's a miracle worker.

40:53.345 --> 40:55.438
You know what we should do?

40:55.948 --> 40:58.815
- We should go out.
- Oh. I'm gonna get changed,

40:59.251 --> 41:02.618
go home to a bubble bath
and a tub of Rocky Road.

41:02.821 --> 41:08.088
Your loss. Callen. Come on, man.
Chicks really dig the James Bond look.

41:08.260 --> 41:11.024
Well, I don't think a little male bonding
would hurt anyone.

41:11.196 --> 41:12.561
- Sam?
- Ha, ha.

41:12.764 --> 41:15.130
Somebody's gotta keep you two fools
out of trouble.

41:15.367 --> 41:18.234
This is what I'm talking about,
because this is gonna be awesome.

41:18.403 --> 41:20.963
I know the perfect spot too.
We are gonna make out like bandits.

41:21.139 --> 41:24.700
- Ooh.
- Gentlemen. Going somewhere?

41:25.611 --> 41:28.478
Just going to grab a little celebratory
cocktail on a job well done.

41:28.647 --> 41:31.207
Just, you know,
compare our notes on the cases.

41:31.416 --> 41:34.943
Not in my tuxedos, you're not.

41:36.221 --> 41:38.155
We'll only be a few hours, Hetty.

41:38.357 --> 41:40.257
We won't get into any fights
or anything.

41:42.227 --> 41:43.956
March.

41:46.999 --> 41:50.366
Now I know how Cinderella felt
with her evil stepmother.

41:51.144 --> 41:53.578
I heard that, Mr. Deeks.
