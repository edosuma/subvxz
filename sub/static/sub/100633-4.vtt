[theme music playing]

00:38.472 --> 00:39.640
-Ta-da!
-Oh.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.774
What is that?

00:40.841 --> 00:42.710
It's a vagina.

00:42.776 --> 00:46.814
Oh! A human vagina.
Oh, I see it now!

00:46.881 --> 00:49.750
Everyone always draws dicks.
That's sexist.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.685
I'm tryna to flip
the script, bitches.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.387
So beautiful. It reminds me
of my mother.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.156
Listen, Georgia O'Keeffe,

00:56.156 --> 00:58.759
if you hadn't made it
so detailed, we'd still have
some fuel left

00:58.826 --> 01:00.761
in that incredibly
powerful gun.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.529
I will not compromise
for my art.

01:02.595 --> 01:04.731
Okay, everyone
into the ice vagina.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.600
Let's go kill Mr. Freeze.

01:07.668 --> 01:11.537
[theme music playing]

01:11.605 --> 01:15.141
I've been dreaming
about getting revenge
on this freezer-burned dickhead

01:15.207 --> 01:17.811
ever since he froze me
in a block of ice for months!

01:17.878 --> 01:20.246
I'm thinkin' classic
"stick an apple in his mouth

01:20.313 --> 01:22.314
and roast him
like the pig he is."

01:22.382 --> 01:24.150
-[cell phones chimes]
-Whoa, oh-oh!

01:24.216 --> 01:26.486
-Take a gander at your
cellular telephone.
-What?

01:26.552 --> 01:29.221
Oh, my God! He finally did it

01:29.289 --> 01:30.823
and she finally said yes!

01:30.891 --> 01:32.259
-Huzzah!
-Third time's a charm.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.546
Eh, he could do better.

01:33.546 --> 01:36.462
Oh, I love weddings! Me and Ivy
have so much fun at weddings.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.298
We'll get so shit-faced,
we puke,

01:38.364 --> 01:39.867
make fun of
all the dumb couples,

01:39.867 --> 01:41.367
make the DJ play
"Since U Been Gone"

01:41.367 --> 01:43.447
until a dad tries to fight us.

01:43.447 --> 01:44.837
-[goon A] What do you
think you're doing?
-[goon B] Stop right there!

01:44.905 --> 01:46.774
-[goon C] Get out of here!
-Spread out.

01:46.774 --> 01:47.998
-[grunts]
-I got news for ya,

01:47.998 --> 01:51.343
this is Ivy's wedding
and she's the dumb couple.
You need to find a date.

01:51.411 --> 01:55.314
No way! After the
"I dos," it's basically free
time. She'll wanna hang out.

01:55.382 --> 01:59.719
For me, the question
is not who I will bring,
but who I will be! [chortles]

01:59.787 --> 02:02.722
I've been working
on a new character, Sandra.

02:02.722 --> 02:06.393
-She's single, by choice,
and down to clown!
-[goon grunts]

02:06.459 --> 02:09.462
I guess I'll bring
Tabitha of the Hammerhead Clan,

02:09.528 --> 02:11.799
I mean, I am betrothed to her.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.533
[goons screaming]

02:14.600 --> 02:16.235
Post-Joker Harley

02:16.302 --> 02:18.739
wants to hook up with
as many randos as she can.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.008
Ya bring someone to a wedding,
that means you're serious.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.342
Not if you bring a hooker.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.745
You are a vile,
pocket-sized man.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.247
I don't want anythin' serious
with anybody again.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.882
So, I'm going solo.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.518
The only thing I'm serious
about, is gettin' some strange

02:31.585 --> 02:35.756
from one or several members
of that 12-piece jazz band.

02:35.823 --> 02:36.956
Whoo!

02:39.659 --> 02:42.729
Oh, my God! It's Beyoncé!

02:42.795 --> 02:45.298
Oh, my God. It's Lady Gaga!

02:45.365 --> 02:46.834
Harley Quinn,

02:46.900 --> 02:49.902
I have been expecting you
and your insane clown...

02:49.902 --> 02:50.902
Group.

02:50.903 --> 02:51.905
Psycho.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.707
Ah! No! It's too cold!

02:54.775 --> 02:55.876
I've got brain freeze.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.978
I did tell you
to wear a jacket.

02:58.044 --> 03:01.580
It is unfortunate that the cold
displeases you so much,

03:01.647 --> 03:04.450
as the core temperatures
of your bodies are about to

03:04.518 --> 03:06.652
decrease precipitously.

03:06.652 --> 03:09.353
[whimpers in fear]

03:20.867 --> 03:22.536
[Kite Man] Oh, what a dick!

03:22.603 --> 03:24.538
Look what I just got
from my nemesis.

03:24.604 --> 03:27.407
[Poison Ivy] "Congrats
on the engagement.
Condiment King"?

03:27.473 --> 03:28.908
What an asshole, right?

03:28.975 --> 03:30.911
Yes, a dick and an asshole.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.812
Wait, why though?
Can you just remind me?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.580
Pff! Uh, where do I begin?

03:34.647 --> 03:37.617
No emojis to convey
the tone, and a period

03:37.683 --> 03:39.019
instead of
an exclamation point?

03:39.086 --> 03:40.987
He's being sarcastic.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.756
But what else should I expect

03:42.823 --> 03:43.957
from my nemesis?

03:44.024 --> 03:45.391
Chuck, are you okay?

03:45.459 --> 03:47.294
No! I'm freakin', Pam!

03:47.360 --> 03:48.795
We have to get
this wedding venue.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.830
Honey, don't put
so much pressure on yourself.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.665
We're just touring one venue,
right?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.701
Ah, no. It's not
just "one venue."

03:55.701 --> 03:57.471
It's the venue!

03:57.471 --> 03:59.473
And if we don't get it, the
whole wedding will be rui--

03:59.473 --> 04:00.706
Hey! Relax.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.443
Okay? All we need
is a dance floor, booze,

04:03.509 --> 04:06.112
and Kelly Clarkson's greatest
hit. We could do it anywhere.

04:06.112 --> 04:08.882
I have been dreaming
of getting married

04:08.949 --> 04:10.599
at the old Gotham corn factory

04:10.599 --> 04:13.353
ever since I saw Melanie
and Clint Howard's nuptials

04:13.353 --> 04:14.687
in <i>Obscure Celebrity</i>
<i>Weddings Yearly.</i>

04:14.687 --> 04:16.322
That photo spread

04:16.322 --> 04:17.858
was like a series of
sick Renaissance paintings,

04:17.858 --> 04:19.660
but way sicker.
That could be us!

04:19.725 --> 04:21.627
So, yeah, I'm a little on edge.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.430
Well, then what
are we waiting for, hon?

04:23.497 --> 04:25.564
-Let's go get that venue.
-Hell yeah!

04:25.632 --> 04:28.300
All we have to do
is impress the venue manager

04:28.367 --> 04:31.771
with our super dope love,
and it is in the bag.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.473
Hey, uh, does this tie
go with this kite?

04:33.540 --> 04:35.375
Okay, no tie goes with a kite.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.343
But you do look
really handsome.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.380
I will now unfreeze you.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.516
Please, do not act
as petulant babies,

04:43.516 --> 04:45.384
for I have no intention
of killing you.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.987
Holy shit!

04:48.055 --> 04:52.992
What are you gonna do to us,
you frigid...
[stuttering] Fuck?

04:53.060 --> 04:55.629
Cursing. Hmph.
The crutch of the illiterate.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.329
People call me a murderer,

04:57.329 --> 04:58.754
but that is a misnomer.

04:58.754 --> 05:02.334
You see, I created this lab
for the sole purpose of finding

05:02.401 --> 05:06.639
a cure for my wife's
incredibly rare blood disease.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.009
It's terminal. Which is sad,

05:09.076 --> 05:10.543
right?

05:10.610 --> 05:12.946
-And yet, there is hope.
-[squeaking]

05:13.012 --> 05:16.583
I have been performing
a multitude of experiments
on the common snow rat,

05:16.649 --> 05:20.553
which shares 98% of its DNA
with that of a human.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.389
The experiments
have been a rousing success.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.927
-Ah!
-He's lost his shit!

05:26.994 --> 05:29.528
This is a real shampoo factory.

05:30.697 --> 05:31.732
[squeaking]

05:33.132 --> 05:34.701
[gasps]

05:34.701 --> 05:36.836
Your arrival has
proved fortuitous,

05:36.836 --> 05:42.641
as it coincides with
my decision to move on
to human experimentation.

05:42.641 --> 05:43.776
[all exclaim]

05:43.843 --> 05:45.978
[squeaking]

05:46.045 --> 05:48.415
You know, speakin'
doctor to mister,

05:48.480 --> 05:49.815
maybe ya wanna
get it right once

05:49.882 --> 05:52.384
with a snow rat before ya move
onto humans?

05:52.451 --> 05:54.987
No. I'm 98% sure

05:55.055 --> 05:58.524
that the 2% difference
in DNA is the issue.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.627
And now that
I have you, Harley,

06:00.694 --> 06:03.000
I can put that theory
to the test.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.464
Maybe we pull straws
to see who goes first?

06:05.531 --> 06:07.000
He is a man shark,

06:07.067 --> 06:08.935
he is like an aged little boy,

06:09.002 --> 06:11.137
and, hmm... A dirt man?

06:11.137 --> 06:13.906
Yeah. Thus, you,
being not only a human,

06:13.906 --> 06:16.110
but also a human woman, are the

06:16.110 --> 06:17.110
-ideal subject.
-Hey!

06:19.446 --> 06:20.880
[grunts]

06:22.949 --> 06:24.084
[goon screams]

06:25.651 --> 06:30.557
[grunts]

06:30.557 --> 06:31.557
[Harley] Ah!

06:32.793 --> 06:34.560
Fuck, again?

06:34.627 --> 06:37.497
I do not know how much
this will hurt, due to the fact

06:37.564 --> 06:41.767
that complete loss
of bodily functions can mean
any number of things.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.504
But, were I to venture a guess,

06:44.571 --> 06:47.040
I'd say that it will...
sting a little.

06:50.211 --> 06:52.444
Wait! I know how
we can save your wife!

06:52.512 --> 06:55.581
You're only saying
you'll save her life
to save your own.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.185
So what, you don't want me
savin' your wife's life?
Okay, I won't.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.454
Hey, relax, relax. Let's not
jump to conclusions.

07:01.521 --> 07:02.788
This is a negotiation.

07:02.855 --> 07:05.059
How do you propose
to perform this miracle?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.927
My friend's a doctor
and the smartest person I know.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.930
Wow! That's the nicest thing
you've ever said about me.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.464
Not you, idiot. Ivy.

07:12.531 --> 07:13.834
Yeah, that makes sense.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.468
Look, freeze, Ivy's
a genius biochemist.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.802
If she can't find a cure,

07:16.802 --> 07:17.838
there isn't one.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.872
Why would Dr. Isley help me?

07:19.939 --> 07:21.908
She wouldn't,
but she'll help me.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.543
Now, let me
out of these restraints,

07:23.543 --> 07:24.877
I'll shoot her a quick text

07:24.944 --> 07:26.947
and she'll come fix your
wife up lickety-split.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.848
This is an
agreeable proposition.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.718
There is only one thing
we can do while we wait...

07:31.785 --> 07:33.519
[dramatic music]

07:33.586 --> 07:34.954
Lunch!

07:35.021 --> 07:36.723
I will go make preparations.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.892
Any food allergies or phobias
I should be aware of?

07:39.959 --> 07:41.661
No? Ha! Wonderful.

07:44.697 --> 07:47.533
[Harley grunts]

07:47.533 --> 07:49.502
Harley, look, I don't want
to question your plan,

07:49.502 --> 07:51.971
but do you really think
Ivy can find a cure?

07:52.038 --> 07:54.908
I mean, Freeze will for sure
kill us if she doesn't.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.141
So we're just breezing past
the whole,

07:56.142 --> 07:58.112
"he's preparing
us lunch" thing?

07:58.112 --> 08:00.247
No idea, but I'm
not bringin' her here
and puttin' her in danger.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.019
I'm buyin' us time.

08:02.019 --> 08:04.850
This weirdo is all
gross and obsessed
with his dumb, dying wife.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.600
Some might call that "love"?

08:06.600 --> 08:08.922
Whatever. If we take her
hostage and threaten
to kill her,

08:08.988 --> 08:11.725
we can get him to give us
his freeze ray. And then,

08:11.725 --> 08:15.862
we can freeze his ass
in a block of ice!

08:15.928 --> 08:18.732
Wow. Great plan.
This is one of your best.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.211
I got one question though.

08:20.211 --> 08:24.771
How the hell are we
supposed to find his wife,
when we're frozen to chairs?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.807
Could someone pass
the mac and cheese?

08:26.872 --> 08:28.108
Oh, my God.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.610
What? If I'm going to
pull off the plan,

08:30.677 --> 08:33.080
I need sustenance.

08:33.147 --> 08:35.548
The reason I wanted
to do this lunch is,

08:35.615 --> 08:37.017
Nora hasn't hosted guests

08:37.083 --> 08:39.253
in quite some time.
So I thought,

08:39.320 --> 08:41.654
this will be fun for her.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.556
Her options are limited.

08:43.623 --> 08:46.759
Jesus, that blue perv
gets his jollies
by freezin' women.

08:46.826 --> 08:51.597
Everyone, let us begin
consumption of the bounty
I have prepared.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.301
Okay, change of plans.
As a former ice-block victim

08:54.368 --> 08:57.604
and now champion
of ice-blocked women
all over the world,

08:57.671 --> 08:59.806
I decided we're gonna
save his wife first,

08:59.873 --> 09:01.207
then kill him.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.143
[Kite Man] Four minutes
early, perfect.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.644
Eager, but not desperate.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.147
That's late in my book, bro.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.615
Mitchell, what the hell
are you doing here?

09:09.682 --> 09:11.618
Oh. Didn't you hear?

09:11.684 --> 09:13.620
-You're not the only
world-famous villain...
-[Ivy scoffs]

09:13.687 --> 09:14.888
...engaged in this town.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.291
I'm sorry, "world-famous"?
Come on.

09:17.357 --> 09:21.128
Wedding venues are tough to
come by in new New Gotham.

09:21.195 --> 09:23.929
And there's only
one unbooked weekend left.

09:23.996 --> 09:26.166
So, it looks like
you've got some competish

09:26.232 --> 09:28.869
from the Condiment King.

09:28.934 --> 09:30.817
[laughs]

09:30.817 --> 09:33.374
I'm not getting married
in any place with the stink
of condiments.

09:33.374 --> 09:36.275
And I'm not getting married
anywhere that reeks of kite!

09:36.342 --> 09:38.778
Oh, yeah. Kites are odorless.

09:38.845 --> 09:42.916
Unless, uh... They do get wet
or if you store them
improperly, I--

09:42.916 --> 09:44.918
Chuck, we can do this wherever.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.254
I will not yield!

09:47.321 --> 09:50.623
Once the manager sees
the biggest power couple
in Gotham is in his presence,

09:50.690 --> 09:52.024
and how sick our love is,

09:52.091 --> 09:53.692
he'll kick your
ranch-loving ass

09:53.692 --> 09:55.395
all the way back
to the Hidden Valley.

09:55.461 --> 09:58.399
Gonna be tough to impress him
with that stain on your suit.

09:58.466 --> 10:00.801
[stammering] What stain?
There's no stain!

10:00.866 --> 10:01.934
Ah!

10:01.934 --> 10:02.936
That one.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.703
[laughs]

10:04.770 --> 10:07.941
All right, Condiment King,
Becca, you got here first,

10:08.008 --> 10:09.942
so let me take you on the tour.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.845
For the schmutz on your suit.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.283
[classical music playing]

10:17.318 --> 10:18.318
[Mr. Freeze] Mmm...

10:18.318 --> 10:19.318
[slurps]

10:19.352 --> 10:20.702
[chuckles]

10:20.702 --> 10:22.721
Why's he doing that?
What's wrong with your face?

10:22.721 --> 10:24.890
Small man, as the consumption
of cooked meats

10:24.890 --> 10:28.761
increases my body temperature
and puts me at risk of death,

10:28.828 --> 10:33.167
please, a little favor.
Describe the mouthfeel
of your steak.

10:33.232 --> 10:36.269
Um...

10:36.336 --> 10:37.336
Butter-like?

10:37.370 --> 10:40.106
Mmm, like butter. Yes.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.043
All right, this is some weird
<i>Silence of the Lambs</i> shit.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.046
Ah! I see you
found your appetite,

10:46.113 --> 10:49.863
my eager little snow rat.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.254
So, how'd y'all meet?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.255
Was she alive then?

10:56.322 --> 10:59.793
It's a funny story. Nora, you
tell it better than I do.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.096
Oh, she's being shy. [chuckles]

11:04.163 --> 11:05.298
I'll tell it.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.335
Nora was the owner of
a mom-and-pop cryogenics lab,

11:08.335 --> 11:10.370
and I was determined
to squash it.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.907
You see, as the CEO
of a multinational corporation,

11:13.907 --> 11:15.774
I had a duty
to my shareholders.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.277
Expand or die.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.480
Now, seemingly unrelated,

11:19.480 --> 11:23.283
I had really hit it off with an
enchanting stranger online.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.485
You'll never guess who it was.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.886
-Your wife.
-Meg Ryan?

11:26.952 --> 11:28.187
-Nora.
-Yeah. Like I said,

11:28.254 --> 11:29.255
she tells it better.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.225
[chuckles] Huzzah!

11:31.291 --> 11:33.394
A meet-cute for the ages.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.062
All I hear is a story
of a big swinging dick

11:36.062 --> 11:37.998
coming in and ruining
a woman's livelihood.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.399
Oh, you grinch.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.835
Look, you'll have to
excuse my friend here.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.200
She's all sour
on love right now.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.039
Yeah, she's not even
taking a date to
her best friend's wedding.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.076
Ooh, is there turmeric in this?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.200
That is a swift kick, nice.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.813
I suspect your cynicism
comes from never having
experienced true love.

11:54.813 --> 11:56.383
Oh, yeah, this is
definitely turmeric.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.285
I'll tell you about true love,
you fuckin' bitch!

11:59.352 --> 12:03.000
True love made me sacrifice
my career as a psychologist,

12:03.056 --> 12:04.857
permanently change
the way I look,

12:04.924 --> 12:08.160
and almost got me killed,
like, so many times.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.431
Love is bullshit!

12:10.496 --> 12:14.868
[dramatic music playing]

12:14.934 --> 12:17.168
-[oven dings]
-Oh, spinach puffs.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.243
I will never forgive Joker

12:23.243 --> 12:25.546
for the damage he's done
to your heart.

12:25.613 --> 12:27.581
Making you give up on love

12:27.581 --> 12:30.317
was perhaps his greatest
crime of all.

12:30.384 --> 12:32.918
I'm also willing to bet
that your outburst

12:32.985 --> 12:34.955
nearly cost us spinach puffs.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.057
Who cares about the puffs?

12:37.124 --> 12:39.326
We're imprisoned by the person
we came here to kill!

12:39.393 --> 12:40.793
We need to get that gun.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.796
I'm just eating my feelings.

12:42.861 --> 12:46.232
His story was so moving.
[chuckling and chewing]

12:46.299 --> 12:47.567
Problem solved.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.102
Not entirely. The steak
is under-seasoned,

12:50.169 --> 12:53.307
and there doesn't seem to be
a grain of salt on the table.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.274
God! Your stupidity
is astounding.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.876
Clayface, grab the gun,
de-ice us, then give me
the gun.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.447
-Great plan, boss!
-Unbelievable.

13:00.514 --> 13:03.484
Do me first. I'm so cold,
my nuts are the size
of Dippin' Dots!

13:03.549 --> 13:05.085
Is that unusual for you?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.352
What? No!

13:06.419 --> 13:07.988
I have regular-sized--

13:08.589 --> 13:09.936
Whoopsies!

13:09.936 --> 13:12.592
I think I speak for me and
Harley, when I say, thank you.

13:12.659 --> 13:15.162
Let me find this.
Ah, there we are.

13:15.227 --> 13:16.429
...testes!

13:16.496 --> 13:18.164
Sure, they're store-bought,
but you--

13:18.230 --> 13:21.902
Listen up, you crazy asshole.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.903
I'm not buyin'
your bullshit story!

13:23.970 --> 13:25.304
I know your wife ain't sick.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.039
She probably
tried to leave you,

13:27.039 --> 13:29.109
and you couldn't handle it,
so you fuckin' froze her.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.309
What are you doing?

13:30.309 --> 13:32.011
Giving her the freedom
you denied.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.581
You're just like my ex,
you creepy control freak.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.183
Nora's not your
property anymore!

13:37.183 --> 13:38.552
Harley, you don't know
what you're doing!

13:38.552 --> 13:41.053
This is for ruining
her small business.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.056
Ahhh!

13:43.056 --> 13:44.658
Now that you don't have
your stupid gun,

13:44.658 --> 13:46.192
I'm gonna kill you.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.595
[Nora coughing]

13:47.595 --> 13:50.129
See? I told ya she was fine,
ya piece of shit!

13:50.197 --> 13:52.899
My love, that I
gaze upon your face

13:52.966 --> 13:54.333
can only mean one thing.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.001
You've found a cure!

13:56.068 --> 13:57.303
I'm not going to die

13:57.370 --> 13:58.404
of this incredibly rare

13:58.471 --> 13:59.940
blood disease anymore,

13:59.940 --> 14:00.941
and we can spend the rest

14:01.006 --> 14:02.241
of our lives together.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.477
[gasps, sighs]

14:04.544 --> 14:05.546
I'm sorry, what was that?

14:05.613 --> 14:07.548
You've condemned her to death.

14:07.615 --> 14:09.716
You better hope your friend Ivy
can find a cure,

14:09.716 --> 14:11.884
or I'm going to blow this
entire place up

14:11.951 --> 14:13.783
and kill us all.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.096
Right. Let me check on her ETA.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.467
Wait. You're telling me
aioli is just mayo mixed
with something else?

14:27.533 --> 14:30.102
Little bit of an
industry secret. [chuckles]

14:30.169 --> 14:32.605
-It goes great on corn.
-Get outta town!

14:32.605 --> 14:34.408
No, don't get outta town,
you got a wedding.

14:34.408 --> 14:35.475
[gasps] Oh, hi!

14:35.542 --> 14:38.544
I thought I smelled a kite.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.013
[laughs]

14:40.080 --> 14:41.914
Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez!

14:41.981 --> 14:44.017
Look at those two,
thick as thieves.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.552
Dreams are stupid.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.153
Never gonna get this place.
We should just leave.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.000
Hey! Hey! Up here.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.124
Okay? Fuck that guy,
he's a dick.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.559
I know how important this is to
you, okay, so I'm prepared.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.638
We're gonna go in there,

14:54.638 --> 14:57.230
we're gonna blow that manager's
goddamn socks off.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.365
-[Stew] And this is,
of course...
-[Kite Man] The staircase,

14:59.432 --> 15:01.467
made famous by
Mr. And Mrs. Clint Howard.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.035
It was the cover shot.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.272
Ah, ooph! I've got goose bumps.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.706
Do you think this place

15:06.706 --> 15:08.575
is just a wedding mill
for Hollywood royalty?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.076
Oh, no. Of course not.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.544
I mean, the old
Gotham corn factory

15:11.611 --> 15:13.379
is just so rich with history.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.115
You know, I think that's what
we really connect with.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.484
Oh, really? What exactly
do you know

15:17.551 --> 15:19.519
-about this place?
-[cell phone rings]

15:19.586 --> 15:22.154
Ah! It's Harley,
and she never calls...

15:22.154 --> 15:24.591
eleven times,
unless it's an emergency.

15:24.658 --> 15:28.128
[sighing] Ha! Uh, corn...

15:28.195 --> 15:30.996
Um, the maize... Yeah, venue...

15:31.063 --> 15:35.268
Ah, fiancée... The love...
Um, well, uh,

15:35.335 --> 15:37.604
you know, Per--
I'm a husk guy.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.966
-So, uh--
-Babe, I'm so sorry,

15:39.966 --> 15:42.442
Harley's gotten herself
into some serious trouble,
and I have to go save her.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.777
I'm sorry. I love you.
I love you! [blows kiss]

15:43.777 --> 15:45.546
So you were about to
enlighten me

15:45.611 --> 15:48.280
on your personal
connection to corn?

15:48.347 --> 15:50.149
Uh...

15:50.216 --> 15:51.618
Um...

15:51.684 --> 15:52.684
Uh...

15:58.457 --> 16:00.527
Did I misread
the situation? Yes.

16:00.594 --> 16:03.296
But Ive, if you'd
seen him feed her soup,
you'da done the same.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.331
They'll find a cure, my love.

16:05.399 --> 16:08.769
But if they don't,
we will die together.

16:08.836 --> 16:11.370
Because I'm blowing
the whole place up!

16:11.437 --> 16:13.143
No, you are not!

16:13.143 --> 16:15.241
Hey, would it speed things up
if I got ya a microscope
for the other eye?

16:15.307 --> 16:17.309
Yeah, no. But BTdubs,

16:17.309 --> 16:19.245
thanks so much for getting me
involved in this.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.447
I actively tried not to put ya
in the situation.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.022
And then what happened?

16:23.022 --> 16:24.817
-Well then, I...
I fucked up the situation.
-There it is.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.687
I didn't know what else to do!

16:26.687 --> 16:28.788
Other than call the smartest,
coolest, hottest person I know.

16:28.788 --> 16:29.789
Well, that is true.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.591
Look, Freeze is crazy!

16:31.658 --> 16:34.226
He orchestrated the whole
Injustice League hit on me.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.261
How absurd.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.230
I woke up in a block of ice.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.767
That's your signature move!
You tried to kill me!

16:39.833 --> 16:42.388
Everyone else
wanted to kill you,

16:42.388 --> 16:44.370
but I convinced them
to freeze you.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.139
As you can imagine,

16:46.139 --> 16:47.541
a group of white,

16:47.542 --> 16:50.177
cis-gendered, heterosexual,
male, crime lords,

16:50.243 --> 16:52.178
they loved the idea
of turning a woman

16:52.245 --> 16:54.380
into a helpless
object of mockery.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.650
-Oh.
-Well, I hope
you're proud of yourself.

16:57.717 --> 17:01.120
You've falsely accused the most
woke ice-themed villain

17:01.120 --> 17:03.524
in all of new New Gotham.

17:03.524 --> 17:06.559
Okay, this is crazy,
but I think I might
have our answer.

17:06.626 --> 17:10.364
Uh...

17:10.364 --> 17:12.132
-[cell phone rings, buzzes]
-Oh, thank God.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.634
I... I gotta take this.
Sup, babe-arino?

17:14.701 --> 17:17.403
Ah, yeah... Oh. Your
old greenhouse? Yeah...

17:17.403 --> 17:18.739
Hey, remember
when we were there

17:18.806 --> 17:20.473
and I had a couple
too many margs,

17:20.473 --> 17:22.675
and next thing you know...
Oh... Oh, it is urgent?

17:22.742 --> 17:24.411
Anything for you.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.814
My betrothed needs
the K-man ASAP.

17:26.881 --> 17:28.515
If you leave right now,

17:28.515 --> 17:30.616
this is definitely going to
affect my decision.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.653
Positively? Because you'll see

17:32.720 --> 17:35.823
how much I love my fiancée
and will do anything for her,

17:35.890 --> 17:37.289
which is far more important

17:37.356 --> 17:39.291
than any corn connection
we might have?

17:39.358 --> 17:41.528
-Absolutely not.
-Well...

17:41.595 --> 17:43.894
The things we do
for love, right?

17:47.500 --> 17:48.500
[sighs]

17:48.501 --> 17:50.269
I wouldn't know.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.872
Just to double-check, what
color petals am I looking for?

17:51.872 --> 17:52.872
[Poison Ivy] <i>Magenta.</i>

17:52.873 --> 17:54.674
[Kite Man] Right, right.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.875
That... That's like
a reddish pink?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.678
<i>No, no. It's a purplish pink.</i>

17:57.744 --> 18:00.279
<i>Don't touch the reddish pink</i>
ones, they're paralytic, okay?

18:00.346 --> 18:02.883
Cool. And, uh, ballpark,

18:02.950 --> 18:05.117
uh, how long does
that take to kick in--

18:05.184 --> 18:06.452
[stammers] You know what?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.188
Doesn't matter,

18:08.255 --> 18:10.891
'cause I definitely didn't
touch the reddish pink one.

18:10.958 --> 18:12.325
There in a few.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.393
Oh, boy!

18:33.547 --> 18:36.282
Ah! [groaning]

18:36.348 --> 18:37.348
[grunts]

18:39.251 --> 18:40.854
[groaning]

18:40.921 --> 18:42.489
I touched the reddish pink one.

18:42.556 --> 18:43.856
Uh, yeah, I see that.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.423
Don't worry, it's...
It's gonna wear off.

18:46.894 --> 18:48.662
Okay, looks good.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.665
Okay, so Nora needs
a blood transfusion,

18:52.732 --> 18:54.233
but unfortunately,
her blood type

18:54.233 --> 18:55.568
is as rare as
her blood disease.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.671
Ever my unique butterfly.

18:57.738 --> 19:00.539
Once you inject this serum,
it will change your blood type
to Nora's.

19:00.539 --> 19:03.309
And then, we can give your
healthy blood to your wife.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.412
[imitating Borat] "Your wife!"

19:05.479 --> 19:08.548
But, the transfusion
will kill you.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.717
[all gasp]

19:10.784 --> 19:12.419
My condolences.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.587
Why the hell did you
have to say the death part?

19:14.654 --> 19:16.789
Now he's going to
make one of us do it!

19:16.856 --> 19:19.526
Well, I've never been more
thankful for my shark blood.

19:19.593 --> 19:20.861
And, as previously stated,

19:20.928 --> 19:23.963
I am a dirt thing,
so it won't work on me.

19:24.698 --> 19:25.898
This is bullshit.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.501
No, it must be my sacrifice.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.604
The only reason I've suffered
through life

19:30.671 --> 19:32.905
in this godforsaken cryo-suit,

19:32.972 --> 19:34.907
is to find a cure for Nora.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.777
If that time has come,

19:36.844 --> 19:39.712
then I greet my end
with open arms.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.381
Holy shit, that's insane.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.450
It is not insane,

19:43.517 --> 19:45.585
for if you truly love someone,

19:45.652 --> 19:50.051
you will do anything for them.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.009
My beautiful girl.

20:12.980 --> 20:14.580
Goodbye, my love.

20:14.647 --> 20:19.619
Have the life
I could never give you.

20:20.954 --> 20:25.305
I will never stop loving you.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.436
No!

20:37.436 --> 20:40.840
[crying]

20:40.840 --> 20:41.840
[sobbing]

20:41.842 --> 20:42.842
Oh, God!

20:43.644 --> 20:46.012
I'm feeling feelings!

20:46.079 --> 20:49.682
I've never seen
truer love than that.

20:49.750 --> 20:53.053
Damn. That's nothin'
like what Joker and I had.

20:53.119 --> 20:54.721
I guess that would be
kinda nice.

20:54.788 --> 20:56.623
Oh. Don't be
too hard on yourself.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.424
We've all been
in toxic relationships

20:58.491 --> 21:00.626
that skewed
our thoughts on love.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.061
Leslie.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.498
Chin up, Harls. I mean,
if I can find true love,

21:04.564 --> 21:06.032
then there's hope for you too.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.901
I'm so happy for you guys.

21:07.968 --> 21:09.970
[Nora sobbing]

21:11.038 --> 21:13.339
And my condolences to you.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.442
He seemed like
a really great guy.

21:15.509 --> 21:16.742
Yeah, good guy.

21:16.742 --> 21:19.113
-So, so sorry.
-He was a real mensch.

21:19.113 --> 21:21.413
Can we go now?

21:21.480 --> 21:25.480
Oh, my God! Get out of here!

21:27.621 --> 21:30.656
Babe, I'm just... I'm so sorry
that I left the venue.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.026
I know how much
this meant to you,

21:32.026 --> 21:34.028
and I hope I didn't
mess it all up.

21:34.094 --> 21:36.896
While I totes appreesh
the apology, I realized
something today.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.866
It doesn't matter
where we get married,

21:39.932 --> 21:43.971
the only thing that matters,
is that I get to marry you.

21:44.038 --> 21:46.373
I don't even care
about the ven--

21:46.439 --> 21:47.807
[phone rings]

21:47.807 --> 21:49.476
I knew my selfless gesture
would be rewarded.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.443
Ah! It's just like
the end of a rom-com!

21:51.510 --> 21:53.547
You're go for the K-man.

21:53.613 --> 21:56.950
<i>Hope you had a backup venue,</i>
<i>you kited douche!</i>

21:57.017 --> 21:58.585
-[Condiment King laughing]
-Mitchell?

21:58.652 --> 22:00.519
No, put Stew on.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.556
<i>-No, he's right.</i>
-[laughs]
<i>Looks like you didn't...</i>

22:02.622 --> 22:05.458
<i>"cut the mustard."</i> [laughs]

22:05.525 --> 22:07.126
Oh, Jesus, here we go.

22:07.193 --> 22:11.530
<i>You'll always be</i>
<i>trying to "ketchup" to me.</i>

22:11.597 --> 22:13.465
-[laughs]
-He can't be serious.

22:13.532 --> 22:16.635
[laughs]
<i>"Mayo" have a good day.</i>

22:16.702 --> 22:17.770
He is.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.506
<i>"Tartar" for now.</i>

22:19.573 --> 22:20.773
<i>Closer.</i>

22:20.840 --> 22:22.642
I think he's
my nemesis now, too.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.545
