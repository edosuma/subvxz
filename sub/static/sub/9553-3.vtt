01:24.500 --> 01:26.420
We're down
to the last two teams.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.870
(crashing)

01:28.120 --> 01:29.920
Uh-oh, it looks like
Fonzie's partner,

01:30.260 --> 01:31.210
Pinky is stalled.

01:32.430 --> 01:33.510
What is she doing?

01:33.510 --> 01:34.460
She's trying to fix her engine.

01:34.790 --> 01:35.380
Pinky, watch it!

01:35.800 --> 01:36.960
(crowd shouting)

01:41.380 --> 01:43.970
A victim of the infamous
Malachi Crunch.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.520
Pinky is being taken
to the hospital.

01:47.860 --> 01:50.440
She appears to be all right.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.950
Hopefully, she's just
a little shaken up.

01:52.950 --> 01:54.450
(siren wails)
But as a precautionary measure,

01:54.450 --> 01:56.950
they're rushing her
to the hospital for X-rays.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.950
Let's just hope she's okay.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.790
The Demolition Derby
is about to continue.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.880
There are only three cars
left in this derby.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.130
Arthur Fonzarelli in car
number six,

02:08.460 --> 02:10.460
against the dreaded
Malachi Brothers.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.720
The unscrupulous Count Malachi

02:12.970 --> 02:14.970
and his not so evil
brother, Rocco.

02:15.340 --> 02:16.340
The crowd is on edge.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.670
There's tension in the air.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.340
Okay, creep, we're going
to turn you into junk.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.310
Oh, get those Malachis.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.510
RICHIE:
The flag is up
and the Derby continues.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.520
It's Fonzie
against the Malachis.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.350
Two against one.

02:30.570 --> 02:32.600
All right,
this is for Fonzie now.

02:32.990 --> 02:34.850
The Malachis
are stalking the Fonz.

02:36.910 --> 02:38.860
Rocco swings around the outside

02:39.190 --> 02:42.360
trying to force
Fonzie into position.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.330
Fonzie is on the defense.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.830
The Malachis are moving around,

02:45.830 --> 02:47.200
trying to set him up
for the crunch.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.450
(cheering)

02:48.750 --> 02:49.750
They're on both sides of him.

02:50.090 --> 02:50.920
Get him on my left.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.540
Which is my left?
My right?

02:52.760 --> 02:53.590
Thy right!

02:53.840 --> 02:55.340
Oh, Myron, never mind.

02:55.680 --> 02:56.540
Count! Count!

02:56.760 --> 02:59.130
(tires squealing)

02:59.380 --> 03:00.260
Here they come.

03:01.850 --> 03:02.850
Alas, Sir Fonz!
(crashes)

03:05.050 --> 03:06.970
And Fonzie sideswipes the Count!

03:07.220 --> 03:09.520
Away, Sir Fonz!
Thou darest touchest me!

03:09.890 --> 03:11.440
Come on, do it
for all of us, baby!

03:11.810 --> 03:14.280
RICHIE:
Now he's chasing Rocco!

03:14.610 --> 03:16.110
(shouting)
Good hit!

03:17.950 --> 03:19.280
Wow!

03:20.900 --> 03:21.990
And that's it for Rocco.

03:21.990 --> 03:22.990
That finishes Rocco!

03:23.370 --> 03:25.320
One down. One down.
Come on.

03:26.710 --> 03:28.210
It's all over, Myron.

03:28.210 --> 03:29.580
I'm done for.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.960
Adieu, sweet Rocco, adieu.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.880
I will carry
the Malachi name to battle.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.750
There are only two men left.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.590
Arthur Fonzarelli
and Count Malachi,

03:38.800 --> 03:40.340
in a fight to the finish.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.170
Now it is thee and me!

03:45.510 --> 03:47.090
(laughs)

03:50.560 --> 03:52.400
The Count just missed Fonzie.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.400
Lay down, Sir Fonz.

03:56.350 --> 03:58.400
They're moving slowly,
stalking each other.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.490
(cheering)

04:01.770 --> 04:03.360
Fonzie is stopping.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.450
Something's wrong.

04:06.450 --> 04:07.450
He must be stalled!

04:07.830 --> 04:09.420
Fonzie's trying
to start his car.

04:09.870 --> 04:11.250
Oh, it looks bad for the Fonz.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.870
Now the Count has Fonzie right
where he wants him.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.540
But he's not making a move.

04:15.710 --> 04:18.709
The Count is just circling Fonz,
he's just circling him.

04:19.010 --> 04:21.680
What is the Count's strategy?

04:21.880 --> 04:23.930
Why doesn't the Count hit him?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.470
Oh, I understand.

04:25.470 --> 04:26.880
He's prolonging the agony.

04:27.270 --> 04:29.690
He's hovering over Fonzie
like a vulture.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.110
You're through, Sir Fonz.

04:32.110 --> 04:33.470
You're through!

04:33.770 --> 04:35.310
(booing)

04:41.110 --> 04:43.570
The Count stops.
What's he doing?

04:43.900 --> 04:46.490
He's tipping his hat in victory.

04:46.490 --> 04:48.400
It's all over for the Fonz.

04:48.740 --> 04:51.320
(engine starts)

04:51.710 --> 04:53.210
No wait,
Fonzie starts his car.

04:53.630 --> 04:54.830
MARION:
Arthur!

04:56.830 --> 04:57.660
He's not stalled?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.380
RICHIE:
And he rams the Count!

05:01.720 --> 05:03.300
It was a trick,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.800
Fonzie wasn't stalled.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.590
Great strategy, Fonz!

05:06.810 --> 05:08.170
Come on! Fonzie, come on!

05:10.390 --> 05:11.730
Sir Fonz!

05:13.150 --> 05:14.150
It's a direct hit!

05:14.480 --> 05:15.480
Hey!

05:19.320 --> 05:21.350
I'm going to loosen
your pigeons now, Malachi.

05:21.770 --> 05:22.820
He's going to hit him again!

05:27.580 --> 05:29.110
Enough, Sir Fonz,
the battle's done.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.110
The Count's radiator
is steaming.

05:31.110 --> 05:33.030
That's it,
the Count is out of the derby.

05:33.330 --> 05:34.420
Isn't that
wonderful, Howard?

05:34.420 --> 05:35.920
Yeah, it's wonderful.
Did you love it?

05:35.920 --> 05:36.870
You're killing me,
but it's wonderful.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.870
RICHIE:
Fonzarelli is the winner.

05:38.870 --> 05:39.870
The derby's over.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.870
Adieu, sweet chariot.

05:42.380 --> 05:44.210
(crowd cheers)

05:48.430 --> 05:50.520
Well done, Sir Fonzie.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.850
To the victor
belongs the spoils.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.970
I think I'll make
a spoil out of you.

05:55.190 --> 05:57.140
Fonz, Fonz, what are you doing?
The derby's over.

05:57.470 --> 05:58.560
It's not fair!

05:58.560 --> 06:00.480
I haven't got my car!

06:00.810 --> 06:02.400
Hey, you didn't think about
Pinky, did you?

06:02.780 --> 06:04.280
I give up! I give up!

06:04.610 --> 06:05.620
He's chasing him this way.

06:05.950 --> 06:06.950
It's not nice, Fonz,
it's not nice!

06:07.280 --> 06:07.870
Yeah, Fonzie!

06:08.280 --> 06:11.150
(screams)

06:11.400 --> 06:12.460
Hold thy place.

06:12.820 --> 06:15.880
Farewell, sweet prince,
farewell.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.330
He trapped the Count
in the men's room.

06:17.330 --> 06:19.830
That's Fonzie's bathroom blitz!

06:19.830 --> 06:22.330
Fonzie.
Yeah, save it for me, Mr. C.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.750
Fonz, how does it
feel to be champion?

06:24.130 --> 06:25.220
Not now, Cunningham.

06:25.220 --> 06:26.590
Where is my lady?
Where's Pinky?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.340
Uh, she's at Pfister Hospital.

06:28.590 --> 06:30.170
Pfister Hospital,
all right.

06:30.170 --> 06:31.170
You were great,
Fonz, great!

06:31.170 --> 06:33.480
That's right, as usual.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.260
(cheering)

06:38.230 --> 06:39.820
Let the pigeons loose!

06:41.730 --> 06:44.320
RICHIE:

06:49.490 --> 06:52.080
But Richie...

06:52.080 --> 06:55.030
I'm about to do something
that is very, very uncool.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.500
Well, go ahead, Fonz.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.500
Have a good cry.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.010
Oh, I didn't know
what I was saying.

07:05.510 --> 07:08.010
I'm sorry. I-I didn't
mean for you to cry.

07:08.510 --> 07:09.510
I mean, people do cry.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.510
It's, it's normal
if you cry.

07:11.510 --> 07:13.020
There's nothing
wrong with crying.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.520
I have a clean hankie.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.020
Cunningham,
would you please,

07:17.520 --> 07:18.860
please pay attention?
Sure. Sorry.

07:19.110 --> 07:21.610
This is my problem.

07:23.190 --> 07:25.700
I got these feelings
for Pinky, you know?

07:25.700 --> 07:27.700
I like her a lot.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.700
But that isn't
what I want to say.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.200
What I want to say
is that I feel so good

07:32.200 --> 07:33.620
when I'm with her, you know?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.200
I mean, I respect her.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.040
I admire her.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.880
Uh, I, uh...

07:39.380 --> 07:40.160
You love her.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.790
I love her?

07:44.160 --> 07:45.970
Yeah.

07:46.170 --> 07:48.250
Yeah, I love her.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.250
I love her and, um...

07:50.750 --> 07:52.720
See, I'm going
to ask her to marry me,

07:53.090 --> 07:54.640
uh, unless you can
talk me out of it.

07:55.010 --> 07:56.510
All right, just
listen to this, Fonz.

07:56.890 --> 07:59.930
Uh, you can't marry
Pinky because, uh,

07:59.930 --> 08:03.480
because, uh...
motorcycles.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.990
You can't marry
Pinky because she
rides a motorcycle,

08:05.990 --> 08:07.490
and motorcycles
are very dangerous.

08:07.990 --> 08:10.990
And, and you'll be out
on the road all the time, Fonz.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.990
You'll be living
out of a suitcase.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.500
Your whole life will
be a blur of neon.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.500
Living in sleazy motels,
truck stops.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.000
Be eating at greasy spoons
all the time.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
You're going to get sick, Fonz,
with a hacking cough.

08:23.450 --> 08:24.370
(coughs)

08:26.040 --> 08:27.620
And after all those years
on the road,

08:28.120 --> 08:30.130
you're going
to wake up one morning,

08:30.130 --> 08:31.510
and she'll be gone.

08:32.850 --> 08:35.260
Cunningham, that was terrible.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.799
Look, I think
you should get married.

08:37.799 --> 08:38.600
You're perfect for each other.

08:38.890 --> 08:40.970
Yeah. Yeah.

08:40.970 --> 08:42.470
But the thing is,
you understand...

08:42.470 --> 08:43.470
It's not going
to be that way.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.470
When the Pink and I
tie that knot,

08:45.470 --> 08:46.480
her driving days are over.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.980
That's right.
I'm going to buy her

08:47.980 --> 08:49.480
a little house, you know?

08:49.480 --> 08:51.480
And we'll have a little
picket fence, you know?

08:51.480 --> 08:54.480
And, uh, I'll buy her
a little dog.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.490
'Cause I love dogs.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.120
Oh, I didn't know
you liked doggies.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.630
I said "dog."

09:08.330 --> 09:11.330
Man... the Fonz
with a dog.

09:11.330 --> 09:13.670
Yeah.
What would you name
a dog, Fonz?

09:13.890 --> 09:14.970
I don't know.

09:14.970 --> 09:17.470
You know, maybe,
uh, Spunky.

09:18.980 --> 09:20.980
Hey, Pretty Eyes.

09:20.980 --> 09:22.480
How are you?
Look at that.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.980
Don't worry,
I'm fine, look.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.980
Yeah, she's even got
a pink bandage.

09:26.980 --> 09:28.990
It took a lot of looking.
Yeah.

09:28.990 --> 09:30.490
A-are you sure
she's all right?

09:30.490 --> 09:32.490
Would I lie?

09:37.080 --> 09:38.660
She's got a hard head.

09:38.660 --> 09:40.660
Hey, you're telling me.

09:40.660 --> 09:41.660
Hey, I'm going
to run down

09:41.660 --> 09:43.170
and tell everybody
the big news.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.670
They're going to want
to throw a party.

09:44.670 --> 09:46.170
Oh, I mean that
Pinky is better.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.670
They'll throw
a Pinky Is Better Party.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right.

09:49.170 --> 09:50.170
Good luck, Fonz.
Thanks.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.670
Um, listen, Sister,

09:51.670 --> 09:52.960
you know, I want
to pay all these bills.

09:53.180 --> 09:54.760
Oh, no need.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.260
The brothers
paid the bills.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.760
Oh, not <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">our brothers{\r},</font></font></i>

09:58.760 --> 10:00.180
the Brothers Malachi.

10:00.630 --> 10:02.220
Aaayyh.
The Malachis?

10:02.720 --> 10:04.220
Yes, there
they are now.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.220
We got money.

10:08.220 --> 10:11.110
Sure, you think we spend
all our money on clothes?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.360
You tell him, Rocco.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.780
My, my brother's very
good at being humble.

10:15.780 --> 10:18.280
It's just the Malachi
way of saying

10:18.780 --> 10:20.070
we're sorry about
what happened.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.820
Hey, forget it.
It's part of the game.

10:23.210 --> 10:24.290
We didn't want to hurt
you, but who knew

10:24.290 --> 10:25.660
you'd go climbing
out on the hood?

10:25.960 --> 10:28.040
All right, all right--
hey, she said it was okay.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.500
Now don't you little
boys have somewhere to go?

10:29.830 --> 10:31.910
Oh, yeah, yeah, we're driving
in the derby in Detroit.

10:31.910 --> 10:34.880
All Edsels. People love
to see us smash Edsels.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.760
Until we meet again, Fonzarelli.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.560
I can wait, Myron.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.400
Adieu, Fonz.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.900
May the sun never set
upon you.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.350
And may your thumbs ride high.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.000
Hey, this is
a touching moment.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.000
You know, you're boring
when you're humble.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.500
Let's get you home.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.290
You need your rest.

11:12.510 --> 11:13.590
Uh, no, Sister, Sister--

11:13.590 --> 11:16.090
is it all right if I get
like five minutes with her?

11:16.090 --> 11:18.590
I'll give you three...

11:19.100 --> 11:20.050
Pretty Eyes.

11:26.850 --> 11:30.940
Listen, uh, Pinky,
you know, uh...

11:31.940 --> 11:33.440
I mean, we've been together now.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.860
We're getting along
pretty good, huh?

11:35.190 --> 11:36.650
Better than pretty good.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's what I think.

11:38.060 --> 11:40.700
So that brings me
to my next point, you know.

11:40.980 --> 11:42.370
Let's do it.

11:42.570 --> 11:44.570
Over my dead body!

11:52.750 --> 11:55.160
I am talking
about getting married.

11:57.330 --> 11:59.720
Oh, well, then you have
one minute left.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.500
I'm going
to leave you alone.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.010
What can you do
in a minute?

12:10.310 --> 12:12.650
Fonz, are you sure
you're ready?

12:12.850 --> 12:13.930
Hey, of course I'm ready.

12:13.930 --> 12:15.230
I tried to have
Cunningham talk me out of it.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.520
You know?
Thanks.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.850
Hey, I'm still here,
ain't I?

12:19.000 --> 12:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:30.170 --> 12:32.120
I'd love to be your wife.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.760
How am I going to learn how
to spell Fonzarelli, huh?

12:39.090 --> 12:41.960
Well you learned how to spell
Tuscadero, didn't you?

Oh, Mom, talk to
him for me,

13:06.570 --> 13:08.570
I don't want to go to the
Leopard's awards dinner.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.570
Your father is receiving
a plaque tonight.

13:11.990 --> 13:14.080
One of his children
should be there.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.880
You know Richard has
to go to Fonzie's
engagement party.

13:17.050 --> 13:17.910
Oh, Mom.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.550
Your father will be
very disappointed.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.890
It's just gonna be a bunch
of old fuddy-duddies.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.840
You said it.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.640
They're nice
fuddy-duddies.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.430
Thanks for picking
me up, Mr. C.

13:30.430 --> 13:31.930
Don't mention it.

13:31.930 --> 13:34.730
Hey, tell the ladies
how well I fixed your car.

13:34.930 --> 13:36.520
Desoto drives better
than ever.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.020
Yeah, just don't step
on the gas too hard,

13:38.520 --> 13:40.940
you'll be in Canada
before you start the motor.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.740
You are so talented,
Arthur.

13:44.020 --> 13:45.610
Yeah.

13:45.610 --> 13:46.580
And you've

13:46.990 --> 13:48.080
got Pinky.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.530
She is such a
lucky girl.

13:49.910 --> 13:50.500
Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.280
You know it's hard
to believe,

13:52.450 --> 13:54.030
Fonzie settling down.

13:54.030 --> 13:55.530
Arthur isn't
settling down,

13:55.530 --> 13:57.500
he and Pinky are going
on the road.

13:57.870 --> 13:58.950
Yeah, that's right.
You know what?

13:58.950 --> 14:01.290
We got a corporation,
and, uh,

14:01.590 --> 14:03.680
I'm the prez.

14:06.710 --> 14:09.220
Oh, Arthur, we're
gonna miss you.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.720
Marion, he's gonna
be much too busy

14:11.220 --> 14:12.520
to think about
Milwaukee.

14:12.690 --> 14:14.770
Yeah, that's really right,
because on the road, you know,

14:14.770 --> 14:16.270
I mean, Pinky's gonna be swamped
with, uh,

14:16.270 --> 14:17.770
autographs and all
that kind of stuff.

14:17.770 --> 14:19.780
I got to make sure everything
runs smooth, you know.

14:19.780 --> 14:21.780
JOANIE:
Oh, this is
so exciting!

14:21.780 --> 14:24.280
Maybe I'll blow this
pop stand town

14:24.280 --> 14:26.280
and be a Pinkette.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.290
Oh, Howard,
we better go

14:30.290 --> 14:32.290
before we lose
a daughter.
Yeah.

14:32.290 --> 14:34.290
Listen, Joanie,

14:34.290 --> 14:35.790
if you want to go to
Fonzie's party,

14:35.790 --> 14:37.290
that's okay
with us.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.790
I mean, you can
see the plaque

14:38.790 --> 14:40.710
when we come home
tonight.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.330
Well, Dad, I want to see
you get the plaque.

14:44.330 --> 14:45.330
I'm proud of you.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.250
HOWARD:
Hmm.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.260
That's what makes it
all worthwhile.

14:57.060 --> 15:00.070
Well, being president
of a corporation,

15:00.070 --> 15:02.570
I'm gonna have to
wear a tie maybe.

15:02.570 --> 15:04.440
A lot of paperwork.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.740
Maybe I should talk
with a deeper voice.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.750
(in deep voice):
Aaayyh!

15:14.830 --> 15:16.780
Fonz?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.450
Hey, yeah, yeah.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.170
Uh, look, I think we ought
to get over to Arnold's.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.170
Al's throwing that party for you
and you shouldn't be late.

15:23.540 --> 15:24.620
All right.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.130
Fonz?
Yeah?

15:26.130 --> 15:28.130
I gotta say this,

15:28.130 --> 15:30.130
and then, and then I won't
say another word, okay?

15:30.130 --> 15:32.050
Yeah, go ahead, shoot.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.880
Are you sure that you want to go
on the road with Pinky?

15:35.300 --> 15:36.390
Yeah, of course I am.

15:36.390 --> 15:39.390
Look, I know what I said before,
but I changed my mind.

15:39.390 --> 15:41.890
I mean, she's gonna have
all that glamour going on

15:41.890 --> 15:42.890
and maybe make a fortune.

15:42.890 --> 15:44.860
I'd like to be in on that,
I could dig that.

15:45.230 --> 15:49.320
Well, I guess I'm happy for you,
but, uh...

15:49.320 --> 15:50.730
I'm gonna miss you.

15:51.070 --> 15:52.990
Well, then you can always
write me for advice.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.320
(laughs)

15:54.740 --> 15:55.820
I'll tell you something,

15:55.820 --> 15:57.320
we're gonna have a very small
wedding, dig it?

15:57.320 --> 15:59.830
And then we'll honeymoon
in Chicago, maybe New York,

15:59.830 --> 16:01.830
and then on to Hollywood,
you know.

16:09.890 --> 16:11.890

we found you.

something else.

Well, sure, Pinky takes
care of everybody

16:35.240 --> 16:36.250
that works for her.

Of course he is.

Excellent news,

17:34.300 --> 17:35.890
the bachelor party's
all set for tonight.

17:35.890 --> 17:37.390
Yeah, we knew Alfred
threw you this party

17:37.390 --> 17:38.890
so, uh, when you get bored
with the kid stuff

17:39.390 --> 17:40.390
and want to do something
really grown up...

17:40.390 --> 17:41.890
Just give us
the high sign,

17:41.890 --> 17:43.350
we'll all go
over to my garage.

17:43.350 --> 17:45.180
I'll even move
out the Buick.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.880
Hi, Fonzie.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.770
What are you doing
here so early?

18:23.020 --> 18:24.440
You shave in the kitchen?

18:24.690 --> 18:27.140
Only over the sink.

18:27.470 --> 18:30.060
Listen, uh, why don't you just
keep everybody out of here,

18:30.060 --> 18:32.060
beside just Pinky,
let Pinky in, all right?

18:32.480 --> 18:33.980
You invited a lot
of people out here.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.820
I know what I did, I got some
private business, okay, Alfred?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.780
All right, I'll do
the best I can.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.240
Yeah, that's nice,
thanks.

18:40.790 --> 18:43.290
How did Arnold ever make a
living out of this place?

18:45.290 --> 18:46.580
Hey, Big Al.

18:46.830 --> 18:49.410
Oh, don't look, I'm
not ready yet.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.420
Hey, Pinky, sit down.

18:56.920 --> 18:57.920
Hiya, honey.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.920
Richie said you wanted
to see me right away.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.340
You are an eager one.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.220
Yeah, something like that.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.590
You got the check?

19:03.840 --> 19:04.840
Yeah, I got it, thanks.

19:05.230 --> 19:06.810
What's the matter? Not enough?

19:06.810 --> 19:08.760
Give yourself a raise,
you're the prez.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.480
And you're the chairman.

19:10.730 --> 19:11.320
Yeah, huh?

19:11.820 --> 19:12.820
Hey.

19:12.820 --> 19:14.100
Did you hear about

19:14.320 --> 19:15.400
Yeah, and it sounds great,

by a bear.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.740
Hmm.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.110
Could be fun.

19:20.410 --> 19:23.000
Pinky, uh,

19:23.500 --> 19:25.000
I can't take this.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.950
What, are you gonna
work for nothing?

19:29.280 --> 19:30.870
No.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.790
But I can't be
Mr. Pinky Tuscadero.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.180
Hey, nobody ever said that.

19:36.180 --> 19:37.180
It's not gonna be like that,

19:37.680 --> 19:39.010
we're gonna be together,
we're gonna have fun.

19:39.260 --> 19:42.800
Yeah, um,
I can't do it, Pinky.

19:46.220 --> 19:48.100
I don't understand that.

19:48.390 --> 19:50.970
Pinky, I-I can't make it.

19:50.970 --> 19:53.480
Uh, Lola and Tina can
take care of business,

19:53.980 --> 19:55.730
you're the main
attraction.

19:55.940 --> 19:58.360
Well, I can't do it
without you.

19:58.650 --> 20:00.570
There are a lot
of mechanics.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.400
Well, wait a minute,

20:02.400 --> 20:04.240
you're-you're saying you're not
gonna come with me?

20:10.240 --> 20:12.330
All right,
I-I won't go either.

20:12.330 --> 20:13.330
That's it.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.330
I'll stay here
with you.

20:14.330 --> 20:15.830
Yeah?
Yeah.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.330
You're gonna give up
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">The Ed Sullivan Show{\r},</font></font></i>

20:17.830 --> 20:19.330
fame and fortune
for me, huh?

20:19.330 --> 20:21.340
Sure.
Now, come on, Pinky.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.840
Let me ask you one
question, huh?

20:22.840 --> 20:24.810
How long have you
wanted to do this?

20:25.220 --> 20:26.810
All right.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.180
Ever since I could walk.

20:28.510 --> 20:29.600
That's right.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.100
It's been there
a long time,

20:31.100 --> 20:33.600
and now you got it, you can't
just give it up like that.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.520
However, you can give
it your best shot.

20:37.940 --> 20:38.940
I don't know, Fonz.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.910
Hey, hey, hey,
the thing is,

20:41.910 --> 20:43.410
in a little while things
will be different,

20:43.410 --> 20:44.910
maybe we'll get back
together again,

20:44.910 --> 20:46.910
we'll see how things
are, huh?

20:47.410 --> 20:49.200
Just know that I'm gonna
be rooting for you,

20:49.410 --> 20:51.000
and you better
make me proud

20:51.000 --> 20:52.450
or I'm gonna come
looking for you.

20:52.780 --> 20:54.370
(chuckles)

20:54.370 --> 20:55.870
What are you gonna do?

20:55.870 --> 20:57.620
You gonna get back
to your hundred girls

20:57.840 --> 20:58.920
again, huh?
No, no, no,

20:58.920 --> 21:00.380
I'll cut 'em down
to about 80.

21:02.590 --> 21:04.010
Makes 'em feel kind
of special.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.800
Aaayyh.

21:09.020 --> 21:10.600
I'm ready, Fonz.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.520
Shall I bring 'em in?

21:11.850 --> 21:13.770
Yeah, let 'em in,
let's have a party.

21:13.970 --> 21:16.440
They all want to congratulate
you-- come on in, everybody.

21:16.690 --> 21:18.780
Oh, congratulations!
Ooh!

21:18.780 --> 21:19.780
Congratulations,
Fonzie.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.280
All right,
all right.
Yeah!

21:21.280 --> 21:23.280
Congratulations!

21:23.280 --> 21:24.950
Excuse me, could I get
some pictures of you,

21:25.450 --> 21:26.950
the lovely couple up there,
with the motorcycles?

21:26.950 --> 21:28.950
Thank you.
We have an interview
at W.K.

21:28.950 --> 21:30.460
and WZAZ later.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.910
And then there's a guy from
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Cam and Piston Diges{\r}t</font></font></i>

21:32.910 --> 21:34.830
that wants to do a
personal profile
on you tonight.

21:35.130 --> 21:36.210
Excuse me, sir,

21:36.210 --> 21:37.710
could I have just a picture
of the Pinkettes and Pinky?

21:38.210 --> 21:39.160
Just for a minute, thank you.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.550
Thank you.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.330
I want you to
step in there.

21:42.550 --> 21:44.640
There we go
and... good.

21:47.090 --> 21:49.590
What's the matter,
Cunningham,

21:49.590 --> 21:51.590
you gonna blow
in my ear?

21:51.590 --> 21:52.590
No.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.600
No, Fonz.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.600
Is it all over?

21:57.600 --> 21:59.100
Yeah.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.100
I'm sorry.
Why?

22:01.100 --> 22:03.110
I was a high school
dropout,

22:03.110 --> 22:05.610
I almost became
president.

22:05.610 --> 22:07.110
Well, do you want me
to tell everybody?

22:07.610 --> 22:08.610
No, no, no.
Kill the party?

22:08.610 --> 22:10.610
Let them find out
by themselves.

22:10.610 --> 22:11.910
Ralphie, Potsie,

22:12.110 --> 22:14.200
let's go, let's go to that,
uh, party of yours.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.700
I love the <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">National
Geographic{\r}.</font></font></i>

22:15.700 --> 22:17.670
All right.
Uh,
Oh, great, Fonze!

22:18.000 --> 22:19.090
just a minute, uh,

22:19.090 --> 22:20.870
I want to get some more pictures
of you later, Mr. Tuscadero.

22:21.090 --> 22:24.680
(bystanders "oohing")

22:25.040 --> 22:27.630
Hey!

22:27.630 --> 22:30.130
That is not
Mr. Tuscadero.

22:30.630 --> 22:32.430
That's the Fonz.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.520
Hey!

22:33.720 --> 22:35.300
(all cheering)

22:39.940 --> 22:41.530
Everybody dance.

22:41.530 --> 22:42.530
Come on, enjoy.

22:42.530 --> 22:44.530
