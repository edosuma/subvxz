00:01.990 --> 00:07.990
>> Previously on "Big Brother,"
hoping to earn Jason's trust,

00:07.990 --> 00:08.990
Austin told him about the twins.

00:08.990 --> 00:10.990
>> Do you know their real names?

00:10.990 --> 00:11.950
>> Julia.

00:11.950 --> 00:14.990
>> How does you telling me this
help you?

00:14.990 --> 00:18.990
>> And Jason quickly spread the
news to Shelli and Vanessa.

00:18.990 --> 00:24.950
>> So he told Jason if people
target them he wants Liz to be

00:24.950 --> 00:28.410
saved so he and Liz can go to
jury together.

00:28.410 --> 00:29.410
>> Austin what, are you doing?

00:29.410 --> 00:35.000
>> Casting doubt within the
sixth sense alliance.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.990
>> Is it possible we're going to
blow up our alliance right now?

00:39.990 --> 00:44.410
>> With Vanessa and Jackie in
power,iacky had hersitis on

00:44.410 --> 00:45.290
Austin or Liz.

00:45.290 --> 00:47.990
>> Since she put me up last
week, that's an easy one.

00:47.990 --> 00:50.120
She's a threat with Austin, too.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.990
It will be a three sell.

00:51.990 --> 00:54.990
>> After Austin lied to Vanessa.

00:54.990 --> 00:58.990
>> A lot of people have strong
feelings about the twins.

00:58.990 --> 01:00.990
>> If youly to me I'm going to
be pissed.

01:00.990 --> 01:01.830
>> About what.

01:01.830 --> 01:06.990
>> The breaking point is now he
is lying blatantly to my face.

01:06.990 --> 01:08.990
>> You lie to me and get
caught--

01:08.990 --> 01:08.990
>> it's over.

01:08.990 --> 01:11.990
>> I don't trust him.

01:11.990 --> 01:11.990
Like, that's it.

01:11.990 --> 01:15.990
>> And they got the other side
of the house on board.

01:15.990 --> 01:19.990
>> A deal with, eight of us,
we'll get those three out and

01:19.990 --> 01:20.990
then we'll go from there.

01:20.990 --> 01:26.990
>> Becky and Clay volunteered to
be nominated by Vanessa.

01:26.990 --> 01:29.990
>> It would be a risk but get
you super frar.

01:29.990 --> 01:33.700
>> With Clay and Becky on my
side to win the battle of the

01:33.700 --> 01:35.990
block, it's time to throw the
competition.

01:35.990 --> 01:39.120
>> While James' mission was to
throw the battle of the block.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.990
>> If you all want to put me up
you can.

01:41.990 --> 01:42.990
>> This is 100% the plan.

01:42.990 --> 01:44.990
>> After the nominations were
set--

01:44.990 --> 01:46.990
>> I have nominated you, James,
and you, Liz.

01:46.990 --> 01:50.120
>> I have nominated you, Clay,
and you, Becky.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.990
>> A seemingly perfect backdoor
plan was in play.

01:52.990 --> 01:56.990
>> If by some miracle Liz is
able to pull off a win all by

01:56.990 --> 01:59.990
herself, I'm going to be taking
a swan dive off the top of a

01:59.990 --> 02:01.990
building into a pool of blood.

02:01.990 --> 02:05.120
>> At the battle of the block--
>> come on, come on!

02:05.120 --> 02:08.990
>> The master plan blew up in
their faces.

02:08.990 --> 02:13.000
>> James and Liz, you are won
the battle of the block and are

02:13.000 --> 02:14.290
now safe this week.

02:14.290 --> 02:16.990
>> And Jackie was de-throned.

02:16.990 --> 02:21.700
>> So I got de-throned as
h.O.H., and that wasn't the

02:21.700 --> 02:22.990
plan.

02:22.990 --> 02:23.990
Worst-case scenario here.

02:23.990 --> 02:26.990
>> Tonight, will the veto save
either Clay or Becky?

02:26.990 --> 02:30.000
And will Vanessa go through with
the plan to take out Austin?

02:30.000 --> 02:34.990
Find out right now on "big
brother."

02:34.990 --> 02:37.950
>> Vanessa's mom, you are
smokin'' hot.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.990
>> Okay, Caleb.

03:21.990 --> 03:22.830
To comps.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.990
I'm going to stand out here
naked next time.

03:24.990 --> 03:25.990
>> How could this have happened?

03:25.990 --> 03:29.540
We have a perfect plan all
aligned, and now Clay is still

03:29.540 --> 03:30.990
on the block.

03:30.990 --> 03:34.540
This is just not something that
I was prepared for, and I am

03:34.540 --> 03:45.990
feeling so helpless right now.

03:45.990 --> 03:50.120
>> All right, it's going to be a
bloodbath again.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.990
Remaining h.O.H. Was the last
thingented to do this week.

03:52.990 --> 03:57.290
The plan was to backdoor Austin
but never in a million years

03:57.290 --> 04:00.990
dithink I was going to have to
be the one to do it.

04:00.990 --> 04:00.990
Great.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.990
Obviously we're sticking to the
plan, but I have to take another

04:03.990 --> 04:04.700
bath in blood again.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.990
Here we go.

04:06.990 --> 04:07.290
Vanessa's bloodbath continued.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.990
>> Poor Clay and Becky.

04:08.990 --> 04:14.990
>> So I just got de-throned as
h.O.H., and I am not happy.

04:14.990 --> 04:17.990
But still working with Vanessa
on backdooring Austin.

04:17.990 --> 04:20.990
>> I know the plan is going to
work.

04:20.990 --> 04:25.990
>> And the thing sliz-- God, we
should have let her be.

04:25.990 --> 04:30.990
>> And she needs to be on board
and not gunning for me as a

04:30.990 --> 04:30.990
result.

04:30.990 --> 04:35.540
Everyone keep your lips tight
and act like you're supposed to

04:35.540 --> 04:37.410
be acting.

04:37.410 --> 04:41.990
I'm going to act happy, and I'm
clearly not happy, so.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.990
How did that happen?

04:43.990 --> 04:45.990
>> I'm really, really sorry.

04:45.990 --> 04:48.990
I mean, there was only so much I
could do.

04:48.990 --> 04:51.990
The plan was originally for me
to throw the battle of the

04:51.990 --> 04:51.990
block.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.990
Obviously, I won, so I
definitely have to do damage

04:54.990 --> 04:57.990
control and possibly smooth
things over so they know I tried

04:57.990 --> 04:59.990
everything in my power to throw
that comp.

04:59.990 --> 05:02.540
I don't want you all thinking
that, you know, I was trying to

05:02.540 --> 05:02.990
help her.

05:02.990 --> 05:05.990
Like, she's the one who came up
with all the letters.

05:05.990 --> 05:07.990
>> Don't worry about it James.

05:07.990 --> 05:08.990
We know she's smart.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.990
We just lost the battle of the
block.

05:10.990 --> 05:12.990
I never expected to be in this
position.

05:12.990 --> 05:16.120
We had every chance to win it
and we just fell short.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.410
It's really frustrating right
now.

05:18.410 --> 05:19.990
>> You're good.

05:19.990 --> 05:21.990
Just as long as you help the
group.

05:21.990 --> 05:22.990
Being on the block is horrible.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.990
Maybe right now I'm safe but if
the plan changes, I could be

05:25.990 --> 05:36.990
going home.

05:36.990 --> 05:41.000
>> Clay is just like, "well, I'm
going to have to play for the

05:41.000 --> 05:41.830
veto."

05:41.830 --> 05:44.990
It's like, "yeah, damn straight
you're going to have to play for

05:44.990 --> 05:45.990
the veto, man."

05:45.990 --> 05:47.990
You lost the battle of the
block.

05:47.990 --> 05:48.700
This gets worse.

05:48.700 --> 05:53.410
Dude, in this situation, just
can't freak out when all the

05:53.410 --> 05:53.990
names are drawn.

05:53.990 --> 05:56.990
>> I'm just going to be calm.

05:56.990 --> 06:00.290
>> You can lose the power of the
veto or someone can come up to

06:00.290 --> 06:02.990
you and say, "hey, don't use
it."

06:02.990 --> 06:03.950
I got the same thing.

06:03.950 --> 06:03.990
Just chill.

06:03.990 --> 06:07.000
Or you can be stuck on there
until eviction, man.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.700
It's not fun, is it it.

06:08.700 --> 06:09.990
>> I'll be cam.

06:09.990 --> 06:17.290
I'll be all right.

06:17.290 --> 06:17.700
>> Wow, I, like, literally did

06:35.990 --> 06:37.990
that entire game by myself.

06:37.990 --> 06:40.990
So I really hope James didn't
throw it, but it kind of looks

06:40.990 --> 06:41.990
like he did.

06:41.990 --> 06:42.990
>> You did tokay in.

06:42.990 --> 06:44.990
>> I know.

06:44.990 --> 06:48.990
>> If that was a whole setup
against you, oh, my God.

06:48.990 --> 06:49.990
Vanessa needs to know.

06:49.990 --> 06:54.830
It shouldn't matter who won the
p.O.V..

06:54.830 --> 06:56.990
Everyone agreed Steve would be
the backdoor interesting and to

06:56.990 --> 07:00.990
hear from Liz that James threw
it, this is freaking me out.

07:00.990 --> 07:04.120
Who is the target this week.

07:04.120 --> 07:11.990
I'm thinking maybe they were
targeting Liz all along.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.540
>> Me, too.

07:13.540 --> 07:15.990
>> Geez.

07:15.990 --> 07:20.950
>> It was worth getting paint on
me, though, that was fun.

07:20.950 --> 07:21.990
Weirdness is going on.

07:21.990 --> 07:22.990
She swears James threw it.

07:22.990 --> 07:24.990
She was like he wouldn't help me
at all.

07:24.990 --> 07:31.990
He was going super slow, and
he's downstared upset he won.

07:31.990 --> 07:31.990
>> What?

07:31.990 --> 07:33.990
>> He's upset he won.

07:33.990 --> 07:34.990
Everyone is quiet.

07:34.990 --> 07:35.990
They're all so upset.

07:35.990 --> 07:37.990
>> Because Becky and Claire are
still on the block?

07:37.990 --> 07:38.830
>> I think so.

07:38.830 --> 07:39.990
>> 100% that's why.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.990
This is ray delicate situation
because Austin still thinks

07:42.990 --> 07:43.990
we're working together.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.990
The thing swe're not.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.000
Look, everyone is connected to
Becky and Clay in the house so

07:48.000 --> 07:49.700
everyone is freaking out.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.990
>> I'm just wondering if they
were trying to set thup or

07:52.990 --> 07:54.990
something.

07:54.990 --> 07:55.000
>> I don't think so.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.990
>> She feels like it.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.990
You guys talk later or
something.

07:59.990 --> 08:00.990
You'll be up here.

08:00.990 --> 08:01.990
Try to read James too.

08:01.990 --> 08:02.990
It's weird.

08:02.990 --> 08:05.990
He's so upset.

08:05.990 --> 08:06.830
>> Really?

08:06.830 --> 08:12.990
>> It's been ridiculous.

08:25.990 --> 08:29.990
( Laughing )
>> No.

08:34.990 --> 08:37.290
So Austin and I are besties.

08:37.290 --> 08:39.990
I absolutely love hanging out
with him.

08:39.990 --> 08:41.410
I love talking to him.

08:41.410 --> 08:43.990
I love working out with him.

08:43.990 --> 08:50.990
But I don't see him in a
romantic light.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.990
Hey, pinching hurts.

08:52.990 --> 08:53.990
>> I'm not pinching you.

08:53.990 --> 09:04.990
>> And he's starting to really
like me, so I'm in a bit of a

09:04.990 --> 09:05.700
pickle.

09:05.700 --> 09:06.990
>> Liz and I are cuddling.

09:06.990 --> 09:08.990
We're flirting back and forth.

09:08.990 --> 09:09.990
We're having fun.

09:09.990 --> 09:11.990
Things just feel really good
right now.

09:11.990 --> 09:14.830
>> So the neck's the tickle
spot?

09:14.830 --> 09:16.990
>> Has there always been a car
up there?

09:16.990 --> 09:16.990
>> Where?

09:16.990 --> 09:18.990
>> Right there.

09:18.990 --> 09:24.410
One, two, three... I'm seeing
things.

09:24.410 --> 09:26.540
>> Yeah, you're seeing things.

09:26.540 --> 09:31.990
>> Stop!

09:31.990 --> 09:39.120
They're weird tickles.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.990
I hate you!

09:40.990 --> 09:42.120
You're so annoying.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.700
>> What?

09:44.700 --> 09:45.700
>> Oh!

09:45.700 --> 09:46.990
It's-- I was not expecting it.

09:46.990 --> 09:51.990
You know, he just, like,
completely sneaked in there and

09:51.990 --> 09:54.990
sneak attack kiss on me.

09:54.990 --> 09:54.990
Oh!

09:54.990 --> 09:55.990
I just-- oh, God.

09:55.990 --> 09:56.990
What a night, man.

09:56.990 --> 09:59.990
What a night.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.990
You were trying to make it
special.

10:01.990 --> 10:03.990
>> I was.

10:03.990 --> 10:05.990
It was special to me.

10:05.990 --> 10:10.120
After we kissed, Liz is a little
bashful about it.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.540
The moment I felt it, and we
both enjoyed tand I'm hoping

10:13.540 --> 10:14.990
there will be more where that
came from.

10:14.990 --> 10:15.990
>> Go away.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.410
>> Oh, come on!

10:17.410 --> 10:18.410
Don't be mean.

10:18.410 --> 10:22.990
>> Good night.

10:22.990 --> 10:23.990
>> Hey, everybody!

10:23.990 --> 10:27.830
It's time to pick players for
the veto competition.

10:27.830 --> 10:34.540
>> Yay!

10:34.540 --> 10:34.990
Wooo-hoo.

10:34.990 --> 10:37.990
>> Only six people will
participate in the veto

10:37.990 --> 10:38.120
competition.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.990
The head of household, the two
nominees, and three other

10:39.990 --> 10:42.120
players selected by random draw.

10:42.120 --> 10:48.990
Will the nominees please join me
up here?

10:48.990 --> 10:51.990
I, as head of household, and the
two nominees, will each pull a

10:51.990 --> 10:55.990
chip out of the box to determine
the three other players comneath

10:55.990 --> 10:56.990
veto competition.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.990
As h.O.H., I will pick first.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.990
I really don't want Austin to
get picked for the veto

11:03.990 --> 11:04.000
competition.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.990
He's our backdoor target.

11:05.990 --> 11:09.990
If he gets picked that means he
could win and keep himself safe

11:09.990 --> 11:13.990
and puts me in a terrible
position for this week.

11:13.990 --> 11:14.990
Houseguest choice.

11:14.990 --> 11:17.000
I choose Shelli.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.990
>> This is so awesome.

11:18.990 --> 11:23.990
Now I can help, see if we can
get Clay off the block, and get

11:23.990 --> 11:24.990
Austin up there instead.

11:24.990 --> 11:35.990
<i> ( Applause )
</i>>> Johnny Mac.

11:35.990 --> 11:36.540
( Applause ).

11:36.540 --> 11:38.990
>> So I'm not on the block this
week.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.990
There's really no stakes in this
veto competition for me, and my

11:41.990 --> 11:43.990
name still gets picked!

11:43.990 --> 11:43.990
This is terrible.

11:43.990 --> 11:49.990
This is like getting called in
for work on the weekend!

11:49.990 --> 11:51.540
>> Liz.

11:51.540 --> 11:56.990
( Applause )
>> Liz getting picked for the

11:56.990 --> 11:57.990
veto competition worries me.

11:57.990 --> 12:01.990
I mean, right now, she's not in
on the plan to backdoor Austin,

12:01.990 --> 12:04.990
and her getting picked is risky
because she might decide to play

12:04.990 --> 12:11.990
really hard, win the p.O.V., and
keep the nominations the same.

12:11.990 --> 12:15.120
Big Brother will inform us when
the competition is to begin.

12:15.120 --> 12:15.990
Good luck.

12:15.990 --> 12:23.990
<i> ( Applause )
</i>>> Hey.

12:33.990 --> 12:36.990
>> So my concern is-- and the
reason I wanted to talk to you

12:36.990 --> 12:38.990
guys is okay, there are two ways
we can go about this.

12:38.990 --> 12:41.990
Either we can go forward with
Liz totally in the dark.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.990
When she finds out Austin was
the real backdoor plan I'm

12:44.990 --> 12:46.950
getting nervous she's going to
get really mad.

12:46.950 --> 12:50.990
I'm not trying to do her dirty.

12:50.990 --> 12:54.990
The other option is do we get to
them first and they know the

12:54.990 --> 12:56.990
plan and they know what's
dignity going on.

12:56.990 --> 13:00.990
>> She will either go to him and
say what the hell you betrayed

13:00.990 --> 13:01.000
me.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.540
>> She won't keep it quiet.

13:02.540 --> 13:05.990
>> What the hell you betrayed me
I'm not so scared of because

13:05.990 --> 13:08.000
that's the truth and he's going
up now no matter what.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.990
>> That's why I think you wait
until after p.O.V. And you don't

13:11.990 --> 13:12.990
tell her before.

13:12.990 --> 13:15.990
You never know how she's going
to respond and what will happen.

13:15.990 --> 13:16.990
You wait until the competition
is over.

13:45.990 --> 13:53.990
Hello.

13:53.990 --> 13:55.990
You're actively following me,
aren't you?

13:55.990 --> 14:00.540
That is so weird.

14:00.540 --> 14:13.990
( Beeping )
That is so weird.

14:13.990 --> 14:32.120
( Beeping )
Really?

14:32.120 --> 14:32.950
Really?

14:33.700 --> 14:33.990
>> Okay!

14:33.990 --> 14:36.410
It's time for the veto
competition!

14:36.410 --> 14:41.290
<i> ( Cheers )
</i>Get dressd and meet me in the

14:41.290 --> 14:41.990
backyard.

14:41.990 --> 14:42.990
It's time to get nutty!

ranger.

♪ ♪ ♪
>> the wood is splintery.

14:55.990 --> 14:56.990
We're in the great outdoors.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.410
The sun is shining.

14:58.410 --> 15:04.990
The bished are chishing, and
then all of a sudden--

15:04.990 --> 15:05.410
( applause ).

15:05.410 --> 15:06.990
>> Oh, my God!

15:06.990 --> 15:07.950
They're squirrels.

15:07.950 --> 15:11.990
>> It is attack of the
squirrels.

15:11.990 --> 15:13.990
And squirrels are running all
over the place and I'm about to

15:13.990 --> 15:18.950
have a panic attack because we
don't do squirrels in New York

15:18.950 --> 15:18.990
city.

15:18.990 --> 15:21.990
>> High-five, high-hive.

15:21.990 --> 15:25.990
>> Becky is like a hooker
squirrel.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.990
She hiked up her skirt.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.990
>> Look at Shelli?

15:29.990 --> 15:29.990
>>.

15:29.990 --> 15:30.290
She's so cute.

15:30.290 --> 15:36.990
>> I look over at Shelli and
that tail is driving me crazy.

15:36.990 --> 15:39.990
>> It may be summertime now, but
in preparation for winter, your

15:39.990 --> 15:44.540
job is to store 250 nuts to win
the power of veto.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.990
>> That's a the loof nuts.

15:46.990 --> 15:49.990
>> You'll achieve this by
rolling your acorn up one side

15:49.990 --> 15:52.990
and then running over to the
other side and catching it.

15:52.990 --> 15:56.990
Every time your acorn passes
over the top, you'll earn

15:56.990 --> 15:57.990
yourself one nut for winter.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.990
But beware-- if your acorn hits
the ground, your score goes back

16:01.990 --> 16:05.990
to zero, and you'll have to
start over.

16:05.990 --> 16:11.120
The first squirrel to reach 250
nuts will win the power of veto.

16:11.120 --> 16:17.950
<i> ( Applause )
( Cheers )</i>

16:17.950 --> 16:18.990
>> Good luck, guys!

16:18.990 --> 16:20.990
Power of veto!

16:20.990 --> 16:21.990
Who wants it?

16:21.990 --> 16:25.990
>> Liz is playing the veto comp,
and it's tricky because if she

16:25.990 --> 16:28.990
wins, she could keep the noms
the same and try to save Austin,

16:28.990 --> 16:30.990
and that would go against my
plan.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.120
So at this point, worst-case
scenario, Liz winning.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.000
>> Being a nominee this week, I
have to win to take myself off

16:37.000 --> 16:37.990
the block.

16:37.990 --> 16:40.990
I cannot drop the ball on this
one, literally.

16:40.990 --> 16:42.000
>> Ready?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.990
Set.

16:44.990 --> 16:49.990
Roll!

16:49.990 --> 16:55.990
( Bell )
( Bell )

16:55.990 --> 16:59.990
>> In this competition, we have
to roll our nut up the ramp and

16:59.990 --> 17:02.990
run to the other side 2 catch
it.

17:02.990 --> 17:07.990
The first person to pass their
nut 250 times?

17:07.990 --> 17:09.990
Will win the power of veto.

17:09.990 --> 17:14.990
The catch is-- if our nut hit
ground, we have to start all

17:14.990 --> 17:17.990
over again.

17:17.990 --> 17:18.990
At zero.

17:18.990 --> 17:23.700
( Buzzer )
>> Oh!

17:23.700 --> 17:24.700
( Buzzer ).

17:24.700 --> 17:25.120
>> Damn it!

17:25.120 --> 17:28.990
It's a lot trickier than it
looks to get this nut over the

17:28.990 --> 17:31.410
hump because I don't want to do
it too hard, but I keep rolling

17:31.410 --> 17:35.990
it and it keeps moving backwards
so I'm losing a lot of time.

17:35.990 --> 17:39.000
( Bell )
( Bell ).

17:39.000 --> 17:43.410
>> Good job, Clay!

17:43.410 --> 17:43.990

17:43.990 --> 17:46.990
>> Good job, Becky.

17:46.990 --> 17:48.990
( Bell )
>> The stakes are high right

17:48.990 --> 17:49.290
now.

17:49.290 --> 17:52.990
I know I'm in a group that says,
"no matter whale what, I'll be

17:52.990 --> 17:55.990
safe this week," but you don't
actually know in the "big

17:55.990 --> 17:56.990
brother" house.

17:56.990 --> 17:57.990
Things change so fast.

17:57.990 --> 18:02.990
So if this squirrel girl doesn't
get on her game face, I could be

18:02.990 --> 18:03.990
road kill.

18:03.990 --> 18:08.000
( Buzzer )
( Bell ).

18:08.000 --> 18:10.990
>> John and Shelli both make 40.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.990
>> Right now I have a pretty
good pace going, and I'm feeling

18:13.990 --> 18:14.990
pretty good about myself.

18:14.990 --> 18:19.990
I've been through some pretty
physically demanding workouts

18:19.990 --> 18:25.990
playing football at Texas
a.Expsmed m., man, this one

18:25.990 --> 18:28.990
ranges up there.

18:39.000 --> 18:39.990
>> Oh!

18:39.990 --> 18:44.950
It is so frustrating to drop
that nut after I've worked so

18:44.950 --> 18:44.990
hard.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.830
I want to throw off my squirrel
hat and the towel at the same

18:48.830 --> 18:48.990
time.

18:48.990 --> 18:51.990

19:08.120 --> 19:09.990
>> Oh, my gosh.

19:09.990 --> 19:12.990
I'm going to be sick.

19:12.990 --> 19:13.990
( Bell ).

19:13.990 --> 19:17.990
>> Slow and steady wins the
race.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.990
>> Clay remains in the lead.

19:20.990 --> 19:25.990
( Bell )
Run, you crazy squirrels!

19:25.990 --> 19:27.290
>> Yeah, Liz, come on.

19:27.290 --> 19:27.990
>> Yeah.

19:27.990 --> 19:29.990
>> Good job, Liz!

19:29.990 --> 19:32.990
All right!

19:32.990 --> 19:38.990
>> Clay is in the lead, but John
is right on his tail.

19:38.990 --> 19:42.990
( Buzzer )
Shelli has lost her nut.

19:42.990 --> 19:43.990
>> Damn it!

19:43.990 --> 19:47.120
This competition is neck and
neck, and let's be honest,

19:47.120 --> 19:49.990
Vanessa or me, we're not going
to be able to pull this one off

19:49.990 --> 19:50.990
for anybody.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.950
So, Clay, come on, man!

19:52.950 --> 19:56.990
You have got to win this one!

19:56.990 --> 19:56.990
On.

19:56.990 --> 19:57.990
>> Come on, Clay.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.990
Come on.

19:59.990 --> 20:00.990
( Bell ).

20:00.990 --> 20:06.000
>> Clay is still in the lead.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.950
Becky hits 120.

20:10.950 --> 20:13.990
>> John and I are very close in
this competition.

20:13.990 --> 20:16.000
Clay is a football player, but
I'm a better runner.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.830
All it will take is one time of
his dropping his nut, and this

20:19.830 --> 20:23.990
is my game.

20:23.990 --> 20:28.540
>> Clay just, like, stops in the
middle of the competition.

20:28.540 --> 20:30.990
He looks a little winded.

20:30.990 --> 20:33.990
Maybe his achilles heel spread
up to his lungs.

20:33.990 --> 20:36.990
And maybe I got a shot at this
thing.

20:36.990 --> 20:37.990
>> Come on, Clay.

20:37.990 --> 20:43.830
Clay, you have gone back and
forth over your ramp 209 times,

20:43.830 --> 20:45.990
and you are slowing down now.

20:45.990 --> 20:46.990
Get yourself in gear.

20:46.990 --> 20:49.990
Let's win this game.

20:49.990 --> 20:52.990
( Bell )
( Buzzer ).

20:52.990 --> 20:56.120
>> Becky's back at zero.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.990
>> Dropping my nut is absolutely
devastating.

20:58.990 --> 20:59.700
>> It's another Becky.

20:59.700 --> 21:04.990
>> The likelihood of me winning
is pretty far off at this point.

21:04.990 --> 21:05.990
>> Somebody might drop one.

21:05.990 --> 21:06.410
You never know.

21:06.410 --> 21:07.000
>> Oh!

21:07.000 --> 21:12.700
Becky drops her ball, and I can
see her entire demeanor.

21:12.700 --> 21:18.990
She is crushed, and seeing that
misery in her is making me so

21:18.990 --> 21:19.990
freaking happy.

21:19.990 --> 21:23.990
I am loving just watching her
crash.

21:23.990 --> 21:24.990
It's that simple.

21:24.990 --> 21:30.000
I'm sorry, and good luck back in
Colorado.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.950
( Bell )
>> Clay is still in the the

21:33.950 --> 21:34.700
lead.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.990
John is trailing right behind.

21:36.990 --> 21:41.990
( Bell )
>> So I'm getting close to the

21:41.990 --> 21:45.990
end, and the veto king himself,
Johnny Mac attack, is right on

21:45.990 --> 21:46.830
my tail.

21:46.830 --> 21:53.700
And all I'm thinking right now
is I cannot drop this nut.

21:53.700 --> 22:02.990
>> Wait!

22:02.990 --> 22:03.990
>> 250.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.990
>> All right, Clay!

22:05.990 --> 22:05.990
( Applause ).

22:05.990 --> 22:07.540
>> Good work, you guys!

22:07.540 --> 22:08.120
That was hard!

22:08.120 --> 22:09.990
>> Congratulations, Clay.

22:09.990 --> 22:12.410
You win the power of veto.

22:12.410 --> 22:15.990
>> You know, I really can't tell
you how happy I am to have this

22:15.990 --> 22:17.540
little guy around my neck.

22:17.540 --> 22:19.290
Five weeks in and I haven't won
a comp.

22:19.290 --> 22:21.290
This one couldn't have came at a
better time.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.990
>> Oh, my God, you killed that.

22:23.990 --> 22:26.990
>> I came in last.

22:26.990 --> 22:29.120
This sucks.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.990
It's so frustrating to see Clay
win.

22:31.990 --> 22:35.990
I'm proud of him, and I'm glad
he'll be using the veto, but I'm

22:35.990 --> 22:38.540
more so upset at myself.

22:38.540 --> 22:42.990
I've lost three comps in a row.

22:42.990 --> 22:46.830
I can feel my confidence in
myself be shaken.

22:46.830 --> 22:49.290
>> I'm really happy that Clay
managed to win the p.O.V.

22:49.290 --> 22:51.700
Now he get to pull himself off
the block.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.990
One of my closest alliance
members is safe, and Liz didn't

22:53.990 --> 22:57.120
win which mines there's no
possibility of noms staying the

22:57.120 --> 22:57.950
same.

22:57.950 --> 22:58.950
The plan to backdoor Austin is
in full motion.

23:14.990 --> 23:16.990
>> Clay, you won something!

23:16.990 --> 23:16.990
>> Finally.

23:16.990 --> 23:18.000
>> Yay!

23:18.000 --> 23:19.990
He didn't just win it.

23:19.990 --> 23:21.700
He didn't drop it even once.

23:21.700 --> 23:21.990
>> I know.

23:21.990 --> 23:23.950
>> He creamed it!

23:23.950 --> 23:24.990
>> None of us stood a Khan.

23:24.990 --> 23:28.830
>> I don't know where you all
are from, but where I'm from we

23:28.830 --> 23:45.950
call that a good old-fashioned,
Texas ass-whoopin'.

23:45.950 --> 23:51.990
>> It's going to be okay.

23:51.990 --> 23:56.700
>> I'm on the block, and I
shouldn't have lost the b.O.B.,

23:56.700 --> 23:58.990
it was being thrown to me, and
him just spanking me.

23:58.990 --> 24:00.990
>> I know.

24:00.990 --> 24:14.290
>> I'm a soccer player.

24:14.290 --> 24:16.990
>> I have something huge to
discuss with you.

24:16.990 --> 24:20.120
I've been dying to tell Liz
about the plan to backdoor

24:20.120 --> 24:21.990
Austin but now that the p.O.V.

24:21.990 --> 24:25.990
Is over and the plan is a real
possibility, I have finally can.

24:25.990 --> 24:30.990
I have no idea if Liz's feelings
for Austin are real, so this

24:30.990 --> 24:32.990
could ploa up in my face.

24:32.990 --> 24:35.120
Liz, this has been so brutal the
last few days for me.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.990
If you wonder why the ( Bleep )
I'm breaking out.

24:37.990 --> 24:39.990
Just get your makeup done.

24:39.990 --> 24:40.990
Don't act weird around him.

24:40.990 --> 24:54.990
And get up here when you can,
and we need to talk 100% alone.

24:54.990 --> 24:58.990
>> Is Vanessa here?

24:58.990 --> 25:00.410
>> Yup.

25:00.410 --> 25:00.990
>> What's wrong?

25:00.990 --> 25:02.990
>> What is wrong?

25:02.990 --> 25:04.990
What is that look on your face?

25:04.990 --> 25:05.990
>> Nothing, nothing, nothing.

25:05.990 --> 25:08.700
I don't like-- I don't want to
be in the middle of this!

25:08.700 --> 25:09.990
>> Okay.

25:09.990 --> 25:10.950
Unfortunately, are you.

25:10.950 --> 25:12.990
So here's what went down.

25:12.990 --> 25:16.990
Three nights ago, Shelli gets
pulled into the bathroom by

25:16.990 --> 25:17.990
Jason and Meg.

25:17.990 --> 25:21.990
I walked by the bathroom and
Shelli is like Vanessa, come

25:21.990 --> 25:22.990
here you won't believe this.

25:22.990 --> 25:25.990
>> Austin has told Jason there
are two twins.

25:25.990 --> 25:28.120
And he knows the name is Julia.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.990
>> Did you know he was going to
do that giknew he was going to

25:30.990 --> 25:31.990
do that.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.990
He made is Tome to me he was
doing that as insurance.

25:34.990 --> 25:37.990
If Jason wins h.O.H., I want to
make sure you guys will be safe,

25:37.990 --> 25:39.990
so I want to tell him a little
bit, but not--

25:39.990 --> 25:42.990
>> listen so you know.

25:42.990 --> 25:42.990
>> No!

25:42.990 --> 25:44.990
>> He made a deal with Jason.

25:44.990 --> 25:49.990
The deal was Jason and everyone
can gun for Julia as long as

25:49.990 --> 25:51.990
they didn't put you and him home
this week.

25:51.990 --> 25:53.990
After this conversation we
realized how much we can't trust

25:53.990 --> 25:54.990
Austin to look out for you, too.

25:54.990 --> 25:56.120
He's not.

25:56.120 --> 26:00.990
He's looking oit for you to get
to jury house to get some ass.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.990
That's literally what it is.

26:02.990 --> 26:05.990
How can that mean more than
$500,000.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.290
You must have some golden ass.

26:08.290 --> 26:11.540
>> You guys, I don't even like
him.

26:11.540 --> 26:14.990
I think that Austin definitely
made a foolish move by spilling

26:14.990 --> 26:19.950
the beans to Jason, but I don't
think that it was meant to be

26:19.950 --> 26:20.990
cruel or malicious.

26:20.990 --> 26:24.990
I fully believe that Austin
would never intentionally do

26:24.990 --> 26:27.990
anything to jeopardize mine or
my sister's game.

26:27.990 --> 26:31.950
>> What Austin doesn't realize,
is he created a giant target for

26:31.950 --> 26:31.990
himself.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.990
He's also making a huge target
out of you.

26:33.990 --> 26:36.990
You're already a target with
your sister pup don't need him

26:36.990 --> 26:39.990
making you a show-mance target,
too.

26:39.990 --> 26:42.990
>> I'm not trying to defend him
at all, but I know he has my

26:42.990 --> 26:42.990
back.

26:42.990 --> 26:47.700
>> Liz, why are you, like,
trusting his allegiance to you

26:47.700 --> 26:47.990
more than ours.

26:47.990 --> 26:49.120
We have your back, too.

26:49.120 --> 26:52.990
>> Him trying to square me to
stay in this house it was all

26:52.990 --> 26:56.700
out of just, like, selfish, he's
obsessed with me, reasoning.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.410
This is the thing, what to do.

26:58.410 --> 27:01.990
If he goes out, we're down an
alliance member.

27:01.990 --> 27:02.290
>> This is the problem.

27:02.290 --> 27:04.990
He is a vote-- he is a vote.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.830
>> He is a vote on our side.

27:07.830 --> 27:08.990
>> All right.

27:08.990 --> 27:10.990
So, I'm going to go get Austin.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.990
>> What are you going to tell
him, Vanessa?

27:12.990 --> 27:13.950
>> Don't you worry.

27:13.950 --> 27:14.990
I can handle it.

27:14.990 --> 27:17.990
I don't want to blindside Austin
by backdoing him.

27:17.990 --> 27:19.990
I owe him at least the benefit
of the doubt.

27:19.990 --> 27:22.990
I'm giving him the opportunity
to come up here and explain

27:22.990 --> 27:22.990
himself.

27:22.990 --> 27:24.990
>> Can you go upstairs?

27:24.990 --> 27:33.700
Vanessa wants to talk to you.

27:33.700 --> 27:38.290
>> Okay, what's up?

27:38.290 --> 27:40.990
>> Let me tell you how much your
back is against the wall.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.990
You don't even know the half of
it, Austin.

27:42.990 --> 27:46.990
Liz has the biggest target on
her because she's in a

27:46.990 --> 27:48.990
show-mance, and twin-mance.

27:48.990 --> 27:50.000
She's, like, target of the year.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.990
>> I'm telling you right new.

27:52.990 --> 27:54.990
I'm an emotional guy, I'm
falling in love with her.

27:54.990 --> 27:59.990
>> Why would you sell her sister
out to Jason?

27:59.990 --> 28:03.000
>> I thought what I was saying
was going to separate it all in

28:03.000 --> 28:03.990
people's minds.

28:03.990 --> 28:06.990
I thought I was making a good
plan.

28:06.990 --> 28:08.000
I thought it was an insurance
policy.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.990
I gave him a little bit of
information and that's it.

28:09.990 --> 28:12.990
>> It was such a terrible
decision.

28:12.990 --> 28:14.990
He's not trustworthy.

28:14.990 --> 28:15.990
This is "Big Brother," dude.

28:15.990 --> 28:16.990
These are not your friends.

28:16.990 --> 28:18.290
>> I believed him.

28:18.290 --> 28:20.830
I believed I could trust him.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.990
I was struggling with it
emotionally.

28:22.990 --> 28:24.990
>> Let me tell you whoyou can
trust in this game.

28:24.990 --> 28:25.990
>> I know.

28:25.990 --> 28:26.700
>> It's me.

28:26.700 --> 28:26.990
That was it.

28:26.990 --> 28:29.990
>> Beef been through this since
day one.

28:29.990 --> 28:32.950
>> You are no idea how it
actually hurt me.

28:32.950 --> 28:33.990
I was like a friend to you.

28:33.990 --> 28:34.990
>> This is not the game.

28:34.990 --> 28:36.990
You are a friend!

28:36.990 --> 28:37.990
>> I was trying to help us.

28:37.990 --> 28:41.990
>> You're full of ( Bleep )--
>> No, I'm not.

28:41.990 --> 28:42.990
Vanessa, I messed up.

28:42.990 --> 28:44.990
>> I'm the one that gave you the
( Bleep ) Fast forward.

28:44.990 --> 28:49.990
I'm one who took all the blood
on my hands when we're both

28:49.990 --> 28:49.990
h.O.H.

28:49.990 --> 28:52.990
I forgave you for throwing the
p.O.V.

28:52.990 --> 28:53.990
>> Are you going to put me up?

28:53.990 --> 28:55.990
>> Well, it's a very real
possibility.

28:55.990 --> 28:57.990
>> Oh, nigh God, Vanessa.

28:57.990 --> 29:00.990
Please!

29:00.990 --> 29:02.990
I would never vote against you.

29:02.990 --> 29:04.990
I would never evict you.

29:04.990 --> 29:06.990
I would never put up on the
block.

29:06.990 --> 29:07.990
This would never happen.

29:07.990 --> 29:09.990
I would never do that for you.

29:09.990 --> 29:12.990
I was scared and made the wrong
decision.

29:12.990 --> 29:13.830
That's it.

29:13.830 --> 29:15.990
I would never go against you in
this game.

29:15.990 --> 29:22.990
I would do anything, anything,
anything.

29:22.990 --> 29:26.990
>> I, I actually do think you're
a good guy and I actually do

29:26.990 --> 29:30.990
think you're just an idiot who
fell in love and made a

29:30.990 --> 29:31.990
dumb-ass, and emotional move.

29:31.990 --> 29:33.990
>> What I can do?

29:33.990 --> 29:34.990
>> I gave my word.

29:34.990 --> 29:35.990
That's problem.

29:35.990 --> 29:36.950
>> To who?

29:36.950 --> 29:39.000
>> To all of them, the whole
house.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.990
>> That you would put me up.

29:41.990 --> 29:42.990
>> No, you're not.

29:42.990 --> 29:43.990
>> I gave me word.

29:43.990 --> 29:44.990
>> Please, Vanessa.

29:44.990 --> 29:46.990
I will sacrifice myself for you
here.

29:46.990 --> 29:49.700
Don't be the one that does it to
me.

29:49.700 --> 29:54.540
>> All right, well just go
figature out with Shelli and

29:54.540 --> 29:54.990
Clay.

29:54.990 --> 29:57.990
If you can figure it out with
them,ob, I'll listen.

29:57.990 --> 30:03.000
>> I just hope you really know
where my heart's at, Vanessa.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.990
>> I don't want to do this.

30:04.990 --> 30:05.990
I don't want to do this to you.

30:05.990 --> 30:06.540
>> Okay.

30:06.540 --> 30:08.950
Then I'm going to do whatever it
takes right now.

30:08.950 --> 30:09.990
>> So go figure it out.

30:09.990 --> 30:11.990
>> I'll be back.

30:11.990 --> 30:11.990
>> Yeah.

30:11.990 --> 30:12.990
>> All right, good.

30:22.700 --> 30:43.990
Be a fly on the wall in
the Big Brother house

30:43.990 --> 30:45.830
guys right now about all this.

30:45.830 --> 30:46.990
Vanessa told me everything,
yeah.

30:46.990 --> 30:48.990
>> Should we go in there?

30:48.990 --> 30:49.990
>> It's a closed door, I don't
know why.

30:49.990 --> 30:51.990
>> Steve is in there.

30:51.990 --> 30:52.990
We can kick him out.

30:52.990 --> 30:55.990
>> Let's go.

30:55.990 --> 30:56.990
>> We've got to talk.

30:56.990 --> 30:58.990
I'm going to talk to them.

30:58.990 --> 30:59.990
Could you please leave?

30:59.990 --> 31:00.540
>> Okay.

31:00.540 --> 31:04.990
>> I'm hoping if I come compleen
to Clay and Shelli they will

31:04.990 --> 31:10.990
understand why I did what I did,
wisympathize with me and try to

31:10.990 --> 31:11.990
help me save in this game.

31:11.990 --> 31:15.410
I'm very upset with Jason right
now because this is not what my

31:15.410 --> 31:16.290
intentions were right now.

31:16.290 --> 31:19.990
I'm going to be 100% honest with
you about everything.

31:19.990 --> 31:22.990
I'm falling in love with Liz and
the decisions I made last week

31:22.990 --> 31:23.950
were because of that.

31:23.950 --> 31:24.410
I was thinking emotionally.

31:24.410 --> 31:25.990
I wasn't,ing clearly.

31:25.990 --> 31:28.990
I was scared and I wanted to
pull Jason aside because my

31:28.990 --> 31:30.990
whole thing this week was get
them in the house, just get them

31:30.990 --> 31:32.990
here, so we can do this whole
thing.

31:32.990 --> 31:34.990
I didn't even care about the
money.

31:34.990 --> 31:35.990
>> Austin, tell us the truth.

31:35.990 --> 31:38.410
>> No, I I swear.

31:38.410 --> 31:42.290
>> If we work with somebody this
long, we want to be able to have

31:42.290 --> 31:42.990
complete trust.

31:42.990 --> 31:45.990
>> 100% thp this is not why I'm
here.

31:45.990 --> 31:47.700
I fell in love with someone.

31:47.700 --> 31:48.990
And this is all that matters
with me.

31:48.990 --> 31:54.990
And I told him one of the names
is Julia and as soon as I told

31:54.990 --> 31:56.990
him, I thought I shouldn't have
said that.

31:56.990 --> 32:02.990
I had an emotional conversation
with Jason and it hurt me.

32:02.990 --> 32:06.990
>> What I'm worried about is
you're emotional.

32:06.990 --> 32:07.990
>> I'm paying for it.

32:07.990 --> 32:10.990
My closest people are putting me
up.

32:10.990 --> 32:13.990
Yi think it was something that
would impact us at all and I'm

32:13.990 --> 32:14.990
so wrong about that, obviously.

32:14.990 --> 32:15.990
I'm there for you guys.

32:15.990 --> 32:18.120
I'm never going foog against you
guys.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.990
I'm not going to.

32:21.990 --> 32:25.990
>> We've got numbers.

32:25.990 --> 32:26.990
They're skeptical of us.

32:26.990 --> 32:30.990
We have to keep our numbers
solid.

32:30.990 --> 32:36.000
>> But you have to convince
Vanessa not to put me up.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.990
So it seems like there might be
a chance here.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.990
Clay and shell rebeing receptive
to what I'm saying.

32:41.990 --> 32:42.990
They want to work with me.

32:42.990 --> 32:46.990
Now I have put my name gameand
trust in their hands and hope

32:46.990 --> 32:48.990
they come up with a solution.

32:48.990 --> 32:51.950
>> Clay has the power.

32:51.950 --> 32:51.990
Listen to me.

32:51.990 --> 32:52.990
Stop talking.

32:52.990 --> 32:57.290
We have a three-fold power.

32:57.290 --> 32:59.990
Vanessa is head of household,
Clay has p.O.V., and the twins

32:59.990 --> 33:01.990
are coming in and they are
numbers on our side and that is

33:01.990 --> 33:03.990
why we have to keep all of us
together.

33:03.990 --> 33:12.990
It is not in our best interest
to see you go home.

33:12.990 --> 33:17.000
>> Hey othome.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.540
, everybody, come to the living
room!

33:20.540 --> 33:21.540
<i> ( Cheers ).</i>

33:21.540 --> 33:25.990
>> Excitement!

33:25.990 --> 33:27.990
>> Liz and James.

33:27.990 --> 33:32.990
We're about to have our steak
dinner from outback steakhouse.

33:32.990 --> 33:38.410
And we each get to bring one
guest along for our special

33:38.410 --> 33:38.990
evening.

33:38.990 --> 33:40.990
All right, guys, join me up
here.

33:40.990 --> 33:41.990
Let's pick our guests.

33:41.990 --> 33:43.990
>> Oh, my gosh!

33:43.990 --> 33:45.410
>> One guest?

33:45.410 --> 33:46.290
This is intense.

33:46.290 --> 33:48.990
>> I'm going to choose Becky.

33:48.990 --> 33:52.990
<i> ( Applause )
</i>>> I had such a hard week.

33:52.990 --> 33:53.410
Thank you.

33:53.410 --> 33:54.990
>> I'm going to choose Austin.

33:54.990 --> 33:55.830
>> Thank you.

33:55.830 --> 34:02.120
<i> ( Applause )
</i>>> This is going to be tough.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.290
>> James!

34:03.290 --> 34:04.990
Pick me!

34:04.990 --> 34:09.000
A couple of drinks, and you
never know what's going to

34:09.000 --> 34:09.950
happen!

34:09.950 --> 34:15.990
>> I'm going to have to choose
my boy Clayton.

34:15.990 --> 34:18.990
>> Oh, my goodness!

34:18.990 --> 34:19.990
>> Clay!

34:19.990 --> 34:24.990
Oh, jamesy, don't come crawling
back to me when Clay doesn't put

34:24.990 --> 34:25.290
out.

34:25.290 --> 34:29.990
>> All right, now that we've
chosen our guests, it's time to

34:29.990 --> 34:31.990
go get dressed to the niens.

34:31.990 --> 34:32.410
Let's go.

34:32.410 --> 34:36.950
>> Julia, I hope you haven't
worn this outfit yet.

34:36.950 --> 34:38.290
>> Like no tie or tie?

34:38.290 --> 34:42.990
I wonder if Clay is a tie guy or
kind of a one-button,un, let it

34:42.990 --> 34:43.990
fly open?

34:43.990 --> 34:44.990
I don't know.

34:44.990 --> 34:47.830
I hope I got my attire right.

34:47.830 --> 34:48.990
Shelli, you better watch out.

34:48.990 --> 34:49.990
I'm going to steal your man.

34:49.990 --> 34:51.990
>> I'm going to miss you.

34:51.990 --> 34:55.990
It's going to be the longest
I've been without you ever.

34:55.990 --> 34:59.990
>> I'll put some steak in my
pants for you.

34:59.990 --> 35:01.990
>> Oh, it smells so good!

35:01.990 --> 35:04.990
>> So good!

35:04.990 --> 35:07.540
>> Whoa!

35:07.540 --> 35:10.540
>> We're walking outside for our
outback steakhouse dinner.

35:10.540 --> 35:14.990
The backyard looks amazing, but
all I'm thinking is this is my

35:14.990 --> 35:16.990
chance for a first date with
Liz.

35:16.990 --> 35:22.990
>> Here's to bb 17.

35:22.990 --> 35:23.990
Once-in-a-lifetime
opportunities, wonderful people

35:23.990 --> 35:24.990
and beautiful memories.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.990
>> And, of course, thanks to
jaimgz and I for pulling out

35:26.990 --> 35:30.990
that win.

35:30.990 --> 35:31.990
>> It is so boring now.

35:31.990 --> 35:34.990
>> Are we boring you, Shelli!

35:34.990 --> 35:34.990
( Laughter ).

35:34.990 --> 35:37.990
>> No.

35:37.990 --> 35:38.990
>> Oh, wow.

35:38.990 --> 35:41.990
>> Thank you!

35:41.990 --> 35:42.990
Holy Toledo!

35:42.990 --> 35:45.990
>> Thank you.

35:45.990 --> 35:48.990
>> Bob apteat, you guys.

35:48.990 --> 35:49.990
>> Bon appetite.

35:49.990 --> 35:53.990
>> Definitely tastes way
different than the steaks we

35:53.990 --> 35:54.700
cook.

35:54.700 --> 35:54.990
>> Just a little bit.

35:54.990 --> 35:57.990
>> This is the best steak we
had.

35:57.990 --> 35:58.990
>> I hope you don't judge my.

35:58.990 --> 36:03.950
At some point I'm going to gnaw
on this bone.

36:03.950 --> 36:06.990
I don't want what's more
satisfying me inhailing the

36:06.990 --> 36:09.990
steaks or the delicious mango
chunks in my Margarita.

36:09.990 --> 36:13.990
The only thing that could make
this night better would be a

36:13.990 --> 36:16.990
sweet Georgia peach.

36:16.990 --> 36:19.000
>> Oh, my gosh!

36:19.000 --> 36:20.990
>> Oh, wow!

36:20.990 --> 36:22.990
>> Oh, my God!

36:22.990 --> 36:24.990
That was so good.

36:24.990 --> 36:25.990
>> Oh, thank you outback.

36:25.990 --> 36:26.990
>> That was delicious.

36:26.990 --> 36:31.990
>> You know what makes this date
just like over the top, just

36:31.990 --> 36:31.990
perfect?

36:31.990 --> 36:32.990
Maybe a kiss from somebody.

36:32.990 --> 36:36.990
>> Oh, my God!

36:36.990 --> 36:37.990
>> The outback alliance.

36:37.990 --> 36:39.990
>> The outback alliance.

36:39.990 --> 36:40.000
>> Thank you!

36:40.000 --> 36:43.950
>> Thank you, outback!

36:43.950 --> 36:49.410
And "Big Brother."

36:49.410 --> 36:49.990
>> Okay.

36:49.990 --> 36:53.990
If we go with the the original
plan and we send Austin home, we

36:53.990 --> 36:54.990
lose a number.

36:54.990 --> 36:55.990
And a fighter.

36:55.990 --> 37:01.990
>> If I don't backdoor Austin at
this point, I'm taking a giant,

37:01.990 --> 37:06.410
unnecessary bath in plood.

37:06.410 --> 37:11.990
The three of us, if we go
through with the backdoor Austin

37:11.990 --> 37:14.990
thing, really, we're not a
target from anyone next week.

37:14.990 --> 37:16.950
So what are we worried about?

37:16.950 --> 37:18.990
>> The odds are better if Austin
stays with us.

37:18.990 --> 37:20.950
>> But my numbers are worse.

37:20.950 --> 37:24.990
T try to close your eye eyes and
pretend you're me for five

37:24.990 --> 37:24.990
seconds.

37:24.990 --> 37:27.990
What am I going to say to them?

37:27.990 --> 37:30.990
Unless you guys are willing to
stawnd and say we're drawing a

37:30.990 --> 37:34.990
line in the sand and let's all
do this, I'll do that it we do,

37:34.990 --> 37:36.540
that but without, that it's just
me.

37:36.540 --> 37:39.990
>> I get you're worried about
being a target, however, I think

37:39.990 --> 37:42.990
there are bigger targets than
you, even if you do this.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.990
Austin is always going to be
targeted.

37:44.990 --> 37:45.990
>> It doesn't feel right.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.830
I'm stabbing them in the back
for sure.

37:47.830 --> 37:52.990
> So the option options are it's
either going to be a big blowup

37:52.990 --> 37:54.950
or we lose a number, a fighter.

37:54.950 --> 37:55.990
Those are our options.

37:55.990 --> 37:58.990
>> You're not-- trust me, you
don't have to convince me to

37:58.990 --> 38:01.410
have Austin stay is a good idea.

38:01.410 --> 38:07.990
If decide not to backdoor Austin
my options are extremely limited

38:07.990 --> 38:09.990
who goes up against Becky.

38:09.990 --> 38:11.990
>> Are you opposed to Jackie.

38:11.990 --> 38:15.990
>> Unless I can see Jackie has
personally debetrayed me, I

38:15.990 --> 38:16.990
can't go against my word.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.990
>> I think that move is way too
dangerous.

38:18.990 --> 38:20.950
>> Jason is the smatter one.

38:20.950 --> 38:21.990
He's the brains of the
operation.

38:21.990 --> 38:23.990
Getting rid of him is extremely
smart.

38:23.990 --> 38:25.990
Without him, they crumble.

38:25.990 --> 38:26.990
And that's a fact.

38:26.990 --> 38:30.990
He's their only smart, strategic
player.

38:30.990 --> 38:34.990
Meg is TV hosting.

38:34.990 --> 38:37.290
James is into chicks.

38:37.290 --> 38:39.990
Jason is singlehandedly holding
that together.

38:39.990 --> 38:43.950
>> So it's between Jason and
Austin.

38:43.950 --> 38:46.990
>> It's going to be blood,
blood, blood, blood, blood, from

38:46.990 --> 38:46.990
hereon out.

38:46.990 --> 38:50.700
>> I'm waiting for the sky to
part and the answer to present

38:50.700 --> 38:50.990
itself.

38:50.990 --> 38:50.990
>> It's okay.

38:50.990 --> 38:52.990
>> Honestly, I'm terrified.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.990
I don't know, I'm so torn.

38:54.990 --> 38:55.990
>> No, I hear you.

39:28.990 --> 39:31.950
But I messed up and I broke my
word to her.

39:31.950 --> 39:31.990
That could still cost me.

39:31.990 --> 39:34.990
I've done a lot of work with
this week and I think I've

39:34.990 --> 39:37.990
repaired my relationship but you
never know with Vanessa.

39:37.990 --> 39:41.830
I'm praying, crossing my fingers
that she does not put me up on

39:41.830 --> 39:46.990
the block.

39:46.990 --> 39:49.990
>> I've been as careful as I can
be for as long as possible to

39:49.990 --> 39:52.990
keep my options open in this
game.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.290
But it's no longer possible.

39:54.290 --> 39:58.120
I have to make a choice, one
side or the other.

39:58.120 --> 40:11.990
>> Hey, y'all, it's time for the
veto meeting.

40:11.990 --> 40:14.830
>> This is the veto meeting.

40:14.830 --> 40:18.990
Becky and I have been nominated
for eviction, but I the power to

40:18.990 --> 40:20.990
veto one of the nominations.

40:20.990 --> 40:28.120
Well, I have decided to use the
power of veto to save myself.

40:28.120 --> 40:31.990
Vanessa, since I just vetoed one
of your nominations for

40:31.990 --> 40:34.990
eviction, you have to name a new
houseguest as a replacement

40:34.990 --> 40:42.990
nominee.

40:42.990 --> 40:45.990
>> This was hands down the most
difficult decision I've had to

40:45.990 --> 40:50.410
make in the game yet, partly
because I adore this person.

40:50.410 --> 40:53.000
They are someone on the outside
of this house they know I'd be

40:53.000 --> 40:53.990
friends with.

40:53.990 --> 40:56.950
They have a great sense of
humor, a beautiful heart, and

40:56.950 --> 40:59.990
they're an all-around great
individual.

40:59.990 --> 41:18.990
With that said, Jason, take a
seat.

41:18.990 --> 41:28.990
>> Wow.

41:28.990 --> 41:36.000
>> This veto meeting is
adjourned.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.990
>> I adore Jason.

41:37.990 --> 41:39.990
He's a good person.

41:39.990 --> 41:44.120
And to see the look of defeat in
his eyes, like, I'm feeling

41:44.120 --> 41:45.990
overwhelmingly, like, terrible
emotions.

41:45.990 --> 41:49.700
But I did what was good for my
game, and it's just becoming

41:49.700 --> 41:53.830
clear to may what the cost is.

41:53.830 --> 41:56.990
>> I'm completely blindsided
when Jason goes up.

41:56.990 --> 42:00.990
Austin was supposed to be the
replacement nominee.

42:00.990 --> 42:04.700
She already backdoored Jeff and
now she put up another one of my

42:04.700 --> 42:04.990
allies.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.990
I'm not happy right now, and I
have no idea what is going on.

42:07.990 --> 42:08.990
>> Jason is on the block.

42:08.990 --> 42:10.990
This is the greatest thick that
could have happened to me in

42:10.990 --> 42:11.990
this game.

42:11.990 --> 42:14.990
This guy manipulated me and
tried to humiliate me.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.990
No one humiliates Judas.

42:16.990 --> 42:21.830
>> Jason, since day, has been my
best friend in the house.

42:21.830 --> 42:23.990
Vanessa is making the ultimate
betrayal.

42:23.990 --> 42:24.990
We all were played.

42:24.990 --> 42:31.990
>> It's the first real blindside
of "Big Brother 17."

42:31.990 --> 42:38.990
Vanessa is a bitch, she can say
she's the most loyal person but

42:38.990 --> 42:40.990
she's talk out her backside.

42:40.990 --> 42:47.990
I'm not going to lay down and
die and make it easier for her.

42:47.990 --> 42:51.990
>> Who will be evicted from the
"Big Brother" house, Jason or

42:51.990 --> 42:52.990
Becky.

42:52.990 --> 42:55.990
And the power supfor grabs in an
all-new battle for head of

42:55.990 --> 42:56.120
household.

42:56.120 --> 43:00.000
Plus, how will the house react
when both twins enter the game?

43:00.000 --> 43:04.990
It all happens live tomorrow at
9:00, 8:00 central on "big

43:04.990 --> 43:06.990
brother."
