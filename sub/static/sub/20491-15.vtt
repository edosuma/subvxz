00:14.601 --> 00:16.534
WHICH ONE
IS IT, BUD?

00:16.634 --> 00:18.501
ONE OF
THESE FOUR.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.834
YOU HEARD
THE MAN, NICK.

00:36.801 --> 00:39.634
ALL RIGHT,
BACK IT UP, BOYS.

00:42.234 --> 00:44.434
ROOM GOES BOOM.

00:48.367 --> 00:49.634
YEAH.

01:08.601 --> 01:09.801
GOT IT!

01:14.200 --> 01:15.767
THAT'S IT.

01:16.834 --> 01:18.734
OH...

01:18.834 --> 01:19.667
AH.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.067
MOVE!

01:21.167 --> 01:22.200
LET'S GO!

01:22.300 --> 01:23.567
COME ON,
COME ON!

01:25.133 --> 01:27.467
THIS WENT DOWN
LAST NIGHT.

01:27.567 --> 01:31.968
AND WHAT THEY'RE AFTER IS A
HIGH TECH SAFETY DEPOSIT KEY.

01:32.067 --> 01:33.400
MUST BE
PRETTY VALUABLE.

01:33.501 --> 01:34.767
YEAH, IT IS.

01:34.868 --> 01:37.567
SEE, THE KEY IS CONNECTED TO
ANOTHER SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX,

01:37.667 --> 01:38.968
WHERE THERE'S A STOLEN DISK
THAT CONTAINS

01:39.067 --> 01:41.934
THE DOMINION'S ENTIRE
GENETIC RESEARCH PROGRAMME.

01:42.033 --> 01:43.634
ANY IDEA WHO WE'RE
PLAYING BALL WITH?

01:43.734 --> 01:45.167
WELL, I'M WORKING ON IT.

01:45.267 --> 01:46.834
COMPUTER SHOULD STILL BE ABLE
TO DECIPHER THE FACIAL FEATURES

01:46.934 --> 01:48.200
THROUGH THE STOCKINGS.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.167
OH, SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO
IS ROUND THESE GUYS UP

01:50.267 --> 01:51.634
AND GET THE KEY BACK, HUH?

01:51.734 --> 01:54.033
NO. NO, SEE OUR ORDERS ARE
TO INFILTRATE THE GANG

01:54.133 --> 01:55.868
AND LET THEM
STEAL THE DISK.

01:55.968 --> 01:57.267
THE DOMINION'S
AFTER THE BUYER.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.100
OH!

01:58.200 --> 01:59.968
THERE'S ONE OF THEM.

02:00.067 --> 02:02.934
HEY, HOLD ON,
HOLD ON.

02:03.033 --> 02:04.868
I KNOW THAT GUY.

02:04.968 --> 02:07.200
THAT'S
COLE THATCHER.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.567
THAT'S COLE?

02:08.667 --> 02:10.199
YOU TWO
PRETTY TIGHT?

02:10.300 --> 02:11.667
OH, WE
USED TO BE.

02:11.767 --> 02:13.734
YOU THINK YOU COULD
USE HIM TO GET US IN?

02:13.834 --> 02:14.934
NO.

02:15.033 --> 02:16.067
BAD IDEA,
BRENNAN.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.000
YOU KNOW
IT IS.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.434
ALRIGHT, YOU WANT
TO FILL US IN

02:19.534 --> 02:21.767
OR SHOULD WE BREAK OFF
INTO SMALLER GROUPS?

02:21.868 --> 02:22.934
NO, IT JUST...

02:23.033 --> 02:24.334
UM...

02:24.434 --> 02:26.200
COLE AND I USED
TO BE PRETTY WILD.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.601
THAT WAS ANOTHER
LIFETIME AGO.

02:27.701 --> 02:28.901
I CAN
HANDLE MYSELF.

02:29.000 --> 02:29.968
YOU SURE?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.300
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.234
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET STARTED.

02:36.534 --> 02:38.667
BRENNAN,
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.300
LISTEN, SHAL,
RELAX. OKAY?

02:41.400 --> 02:44.534
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

02:53.067 --> 02:55.267
HEY, DON'T LEAVE
ME HERE, MAN!

03:05.767 --> 03:10.400
<i>SCIENTIST ADAM KANE WAS A
PIONEER OF GENETIC RESEARCH,</i>

03:10.501 --> 03:14.367
<i>MANIPULATING DNA TO
SAVE HUMAN LIVES.</i>

03:14.467 --> 03:17.868
<i>BUT IN MANY THEIR GENES
UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED</i>

03:17.968 --> 03:21.100
<i>AND THEY DEVELOPED
SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES.</i>

03:50.467 --> 03:52.801
<i>TOGETHER, FOUR OF THE MOST
POWERFUL FIGHT</i>

03:52.901 --> 03:56.534
<i>TO PROTECT A WORLD THAT
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST.</i>

03:59.767 --> 04:02.033
<i>THEY ARE... MUTANT X</i>

04:04.501 --> 04:06.601
MAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN COLE SINCE
THE DAY I JOINED MUTANT X.

04:06.701 --> 04:07.934
I'M SURE, AS FAR
AS HE'S CONCERNED,

04:08.033 --> 04:11.267
I DROPPED OFF THE FACE
OF THE EARTH.

04:11.367 --> 04:12.234
YUP.

04:12.334 --> 04:14.300
YEAH, GOOD
OLD DAYS, HUH?

04:14.400 --> 04:18.000
BREAKING AND ENTERING,
GRAND THEFT AUTO...

04:18.100 --> 04:20.934
WELL, THAT WAS UNTIL I
MOVED US UP TO BANK ROBBERY.

04:21.033 --> 04:22.901
THAT MUST LOOK
GOOD ON YOUR RESUME.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.567
[LAUGHS]

04:24.667 --> 04:25.701
YOU KNOW
WHAT, MAN?

04:25.801 --> 04:27.501
IT'S CRAZY, BECAUSE WE
NEVER GOT CAUGHT

04:27.601 --> 04:29.067
AND WE WERE SERIOUSLY
OUT OF OUR MINDS.

04:29.167 --> 04:32.567
YEAH. YOU, UH, MIND
PUTTING THAT AWAY?

04:32.667 --> 04:34.467
HUH.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.067
...SO WHAT'S TAKING SO
LONG WITH MY RAP SHEET, HUH?

04:38.167 --> 04:39.801
HEY, THREE YEARS IS A LONG
TIME TO BE UNDER THE RADAR,

04:39.901 --> 04:42.667
ALL RIGHT?

04:42.767 --> 04:43.901
WHAT THE HELL?

04:44.033 --> 04:45.567
UH, ADAM'S ALREADY
MADE YOUR PROFILE.

04:45.667 --> 04:47.601
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T UPLOAD
IT TO THE POLICE DATABASE,

04:47.701 --> 04:50.367
BUT THERE IT IS... YOUR MUG
SHOT AND YOUR RAP SHEET.

04:50.467 --> 04:52.801
SO, HE MADE IT THE DAY
YOU JOINED MUTANT X.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.434
I GUESS HE FIGURED IF THINGS
DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR YOU HERE,

04:54.534 --> 04:57.601
YOU'D ALWAYS HAVE A GET OUT
OF MUTANT X FREE CARD, HUH?

04:57.701 --> 05:00.234
I GUESS HE HAD HIS DOUBTS
ABOUT ME BACK THEN.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.501
CAN YOU ACTIVATE IT?

05:03.601 --> 05:06.801
YEAH. ALL I NEED IS A
RELEASE DATE AND YOU'RE SET.

05:06.901 --> 05:09.667
MAKE IT TODAY.

05:09.767 --> 05:13.000
I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA
SENDING BRENNAN IN THERE.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.801
NOW THE LEADER OF
THAT GANG IS A KILLER

05:14.901 --> 05:17.334
AND COLE IS WAY
TOO UNPREDICTABLE.

05:17.434 --> 05:18.834
BRENNAN CAN TAKE
CARE OF HIMSELF.

05:18.934 --> 05:21.267
LEXA, YOU
DON'T GET IT.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.701
BRENNAN USED TO SAY HE AND
COLE WERE ADRENALINE JUNKIES.

05:23.801 --> 05:26.534
IT'S LIKE SOME KIND
OF DEATH WISH THING.

05:26.634 --> 05:28.100
I MEAN, THEY USED TO
STEAL CARS IN THE WINTER

05:28.200 --> 05:29.467
AND RACE THEM ON THE LAKE.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.734
BRENNAN ALMOST DIED ONCE, WHEN
HIS CAR WENT THROUGH THE ICE.

05:31.834 --> 05:33.100
I KNOW BUT, SHAL,
THEY WERE KIDS.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.300
NO!

05:34.400 --> 05:35.868
WHEN THEY GET TOGETHER
THEY PUSH THINGS TOO FAR.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.300
THEY'RE A
LETHAL MIX.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.367
OKAY, MAYBE THAT WAS TRUE BACK
THEN, BUT BRENNAN'S CHANGED.

05:39.467 --> 05:40.968
WHAT IF
YOU'RE WRONG?

05:41.067 --> 05:43.634
SHE'S NOT.

05:44.367 --> 05:47.033
I'LL BE FINE.

05:47.133 --> 05:48.801
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP FOR THIS?

05:48.901 --> 05:51.467
I KNOW WHAT
I'M GETTING INTO.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.000
ALL RIGHT.

06:01.701 --> 06:03.334
I HOPE SO.

06:33.334 --> 06:36.133
ADAM?

06:36.234 --> 06:38.467
YOU SON OF A...

06:39.901 --> 06:41.133
YOU HAVE EVERY
RIGHT TO BE ANGRY,

06:41.234 --> 06:44.834
BUT I HAD TO DISAPPEAR FOR
THE SURVIVAL OF MUTANT X.

06:44.934 --> 06:45.834
WHERE ARE YOU?

06:45.934 --> 06:47.467
I'M NOT TALKING
TO A HOLOGRAM.

06:47.567 --> 06:48.534
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

06:48.634 --> 06:49.701
YOU JUST HAVE
TO TRUST ME.

06:49.801 --> 06:51.968
LIKE YOU
TRUSTED ME?

06:52.067 --> 06:55.467
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I ALWAYS
BELIEVED IN YOUR POTENTIAL,

06:55.567 --> 06:56.601
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:56.701 --> 06:57.767
AT FIRST, I WASN'T SURE

06:57.868 --> 06:59.200
THAT YOU COULD MAKE IT
AS ONE OF THE TEAM.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.200
OH, YEAH, SO THAT...

07:00.300 --> 07:01.300
THAT PROFILE YOU CREATED,

07:01.400 --> 07:02.734
THAT WAS JUST A
CONTINGENCY PLAN?

07:02.834 --> 07:04.300
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.334
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
YOU KEEP MY PRESENCE

07:06.434 --> 07:08.133
A SECRET FROM
THE OTHERS.

07:08.234 --> 07:11.267
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF YOUR SECRETS.

07:11.367 --> 07:13.634
YOUR FRIEND COLE IS
IN WAY OVER HIS HEAD.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.400
YOU DON'T THINK
I KNOW THAT?

07:16.501 --> 07:18.200
WHO ARE YOU WORKING
FOR NOW, ADAM?

07:18.300 --> 07:19.067
THE DOMINION?

07:19.167 --> 07:20.701
NO. BUT THE DOMINION IS SCARED.

07:20.801 --> 07:22.934
AND WHEN THEY'RE SCARED,
THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

07:23.033 --> 07:25.434
SO YOU JUST CAME BACK TO
GIVE ME A PEP TALK?

07:25.534 --> 07:27.434
LOOK, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE WALKING INTO.

07:27.534 --> 07:28.434
YOU GOTTA
LISTEN TO ME.

07:28.534 --> 07:30.200
NO. ADAM.
YOU GAVE UP THAT RIGHT

07:30.300 --> 07:32.434
THE DAY THAT YOU VANISHED
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

07:32.534 --> 07:33.334
BRENNAN!

07:33.434 --> 07:35.334
BRENNAN!!

07:41.300 --> 07:42.868
HEY, SWEETIE!

07:42.968 --> 07:46.767
HOW ABOUT ONE COSMOPOLITAN
FOR THE PRETTY LADY HERE.

07:46.868 --> 07:48.701
UH, HOW YOU DOIN'?

07:48.801 --> 07:50.834
IF I WAS YOU, I'D WALK
AWAY RIGHT THIS SECOND,

07:50.934 --> 07:53.634
BEFORE HE REALLY STARTS
HITTING ON YOU.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.667
SORRY, MAN,
DO I KNOW YOU?

07:55.767 --> 07:56.534
OH, COME ON.

07:56.634 --> 07:57.634
CUT ME SOME
SLACK, COLE.

07:57.734 --> 07:59.501
I'VE BEEN IN THE
JOINT FOR THREE YEARS.

07:59.601 --> 08:01.667
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

08:01.767 --> 08:04.200
SORRY TO
DISAPPOINT YOU.

08:07.501 --> 08:10.200
YEAH.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.667
I'M BACK.

08:12.767 --> 08:13.901
YOU'RE BACK.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.100
I'M BACK.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.767
[LAUGHS]

08:16.868 --> 08:17.767
YOU'RE
KIDDING ME, MAN.

08:17.868 --> 08:18.868
WHAT'S UP,
BROTHER?

08:18.968 --> 08:20.567
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.968
REALLY.

08:22.067 --> 08:25.033
HEY, SWEETIE,
TWO SCOTCHES.

08:25.133 --> 08:26.601
ME AND MY
BUDDY, HERE.

08:26.701 --> 08:27.601
LISTEN, WHAT'S
GOING ON, MAN?

08:27.701 --> 08:28.501
LIKE, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

08:28.601 --> 08:29.701
WHERE ARE
YOU STAYING?

08:29.801 --> 08:31.868
WELL, THAT'S WHY I KIND
OF CAME TO TALK TO YOU.

08:31.968 --> 08:33.967
THANKS. [SIGHS]

08:34.067 --> 08:37.133
LOOK, I NEED
SOMETHING, MAN.

08:37.234 --> 08:38.634
YEAH?

08:38.734 --> 08:41.234
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
COULD HOOK A BROTHER UP?

08:41.333 --> 08:42.601
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

08:42.701 --> 08:43.900
THINGS ARE...

08:44.000 --> 08:46.434
THINGS ARE PRETTY QUIET
AROUND HERE, YOU KNOW?

08:46.534 --> 08:47.567
COLE.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.267
WHO ARE YOU TALKING
TO HERE, MAN?

08:49.367 --> 08:50.467
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW,

08:50.567 --> 08:53.167
THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS STANDING
ON TOP OF THE ACTION.

08:53.267 --> 08:56.200
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I
GOT SOMETHING GOING...

08:56.300 --> 08:59.367
BUT I CAN'T
CUT YOU IN.

08:59.467 --> 09:00.868
I'M JUST A DRIVER.

09:00.968 --> 09:01.901
SERIOUSLY.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.467
IT'S, LIKE,
IT'S NOT MY DEAL.

09:03.567 --> 09:04.734
IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

09:04.834 --> 09:07.400
LISTEN, ALL I
NEED IS THE INTRO.

09:07.501 --> 09:09.834
COLE, I REALLY
NEED THIS.

09:09.934 --> 09:11.701
MAN, I NEED TO GET
BACK ON MY FEET.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.767
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A HANDOUT, ALRIGHT?

09:13.868 --> 09:15.434
I JUST...

09:15.534 --> 09:17.634
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT
I BRING TO A CREW.

09:17.734 --> 09:19.067
YEAH?

09:19.167 --> 09:21.434
YEAH, I DO KNOW WHAT
YOU BRING TO A CREW.

09:21.534 --> 09:23.601
[LAUGHS]

09:23.701 --> 09:26.501
OKAY, MAN,
I'LL MAKE THE CALL.

09:26.601 --> 09:27.667
YOU'RE MY MAN.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.567
COME ON.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.501
BRENNAN'S MADE CONTACT.

09:32.767 --> 09:33.934
LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT
TO GET A FACE TO FACE

09:34.033 --> 09:35.934
WITH THE LEADER
OF THAT GANG.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.801
HUH, DON'T GET TOO
EXCITED THERE, SHAL.

09:37.901 --> 09:40.167
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T.

09:40.267 --> 09:42.267
SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

09:42.367 --> 09:43.534
IT'S NOT
IMPORTANT.

09:43.634 --> 09:44.868
WHAT'VE YOU GOT?

09:44.968 --> 09:48.033
WELL, SINCE IT'S THE
BUYER WE'RE AFTER,

09:48.133 --> 09:49.334
I FIGURED IT'D
BE A GOOD IDEA

09:49.434 --> 09:50.767
TO FIGURE OUT WHO
PUT THE KEY CARD

09:50.868 --> 09:52.834
IN THE SAFETY DEPOSIT
BOX TO BEGIN WITH.

09:52.934 --> 09:54.601
UH UH.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.901
HOW FAR BACK DID YOU
HAVE TO GO TO GET THAT?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.400
THREE WEEKS.

10:04.501 --> 10:06.634
THAT WAS THE EASY PART.

10:06.734 --> 10:09.267
HAVING A HARD TIME
LOCKING IN AN ID FOR HIM.

10:09.367 --> 10:11.234
COME ON, JESS,
YOU'RE THE MASTER.

10:11.334 --> 10:13.267
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A
WAY TO FIGURE IT OUT.

10:13.367 --> 10:15.567
IS THAT YOUR LAME WAY
OF BUTTERING ME UP?

10:15.667 --> 10:18.100
ACTUALLY,
I WAS BEING SINCERE.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.000
YEAH.

10:20.100 --> 10:22.267
JUST DO IT,
OKAY?

10:26.501 --> 10:29.367
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T
NEED ANY NEW GUYS.

10:29.467 --> 10:30.868
NOW, THAT'S
NOT TRUE.

10:30.968 --> 10:32.467
WE LOST
EINSTEIN.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.567
WE NEED ANOTHER
CIRCUIT GUY.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.601
WELL, AREN'T YOU
THE SELF-STARTER!

10:37.701 --> 10:38.767
WHATEVER.

10:38.868 --> 10:42.300
ANYWAYS, MY BUDDY HERE IS IN
A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN,

10:42.400 --> 10:44.100
AND VERY
UNIQUE TALENTS.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.834
AND BELIEVE ME
WHEN I SAY IT.

10:45.934 --> 10:47.234
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE HIM.

10:47.334 --> 10:49.434
THANKS FOR
THE PITCH.

10:49.534 --> 10:51.601
ETHAN, MAN,
COME ON.

10:51.701 --> 10:52.834
LISTEN, LET'S JUST
GET OUT OF HERE.

10:52.934 --> 10:54.267
HEY, HEY, HEY.

10:54.367 --> 10:55.667
JUST RELAX.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.667
WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
SPORT?

10:57.767 --> 10:59.234
BRENNAN
MULWRAY.

10:59.334 --> 11:01.834
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D RECRUIT
ANOTHER SELF-STARTER?

11:01.934 --> 11:03.234
FILL HIM IN
ON OUR AGENDA?

11:03.334 --> 11:04.334
I CAME
TO HIM.

11:04.434 --> 11:05.234
SHUT UP!

11:05.334 --> 11:06.400
I'M NOT TALKING
TO YOU.

11:06.501 --> 11:08.968
I GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS GUY, ETH.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.934
I DON'T LIKE
HIM ONE BIT.

11:11.033 --> 11:12.501
WHO ARE YOU,
REALLY?

11:12.601 --> 11:13.734
YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE A GUY

11:13.834 --> 11:17.801
WHO SPENT THE LAST
THREE YEARS IN JAIL.

11:17.901 --> 11:19.334
SHOW HIM
THE ALLEY.

11:19.434 --> 11:20.834
HAVE SOME FUN.

11:20.934 --> 11:23.267
DON'T I
ALWAYS?

11:23.367 --> 11:25.367
OKAY.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.367
HE'S IN
TROUBLE.

11:37.467 --> 11:38.334
THEY MADE
HIM.

11:38.434 --> 11:39.567
I'M PULLING
HIM OUT NOW.

11:39.667 --> 11:40.667
NO. WAIT, SHAL.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.000
GIVE HIM SOME SPACE,
ALL RIGHT?

11:42.100 --> 11:43.334
BRENNAN KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

11:43.434 --> 11:44.667
HE'S OUT OF
HIS LEAGUE HERE.

11:44.767 --> 11:45.934
LOOK, JUST
STAY BACK.

11:46.033 --> 11:47.434
PLEASE DON'T BLOW
THIS FOR HIM.

11:47.534 --> 11:50.534
YEAH, WHY START NOW WHEN HE'S
DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB ALREADY?

12:01.133 --> 12:05.501
HE'S GOING TO MESS YOU
UP REAL GOOD, PRETTY BOY.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.467
WELL, NEITHER
DOES HE.

13:03.734 --> 13:05.534
COME ON,
BRENNAN.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.100
GET UP.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.000
GET UP!

13:47.501 --> 13:49.200
[LAUGHS]

14:17.067 --> 14:19.734
HOPE YOU BOYS
GOT RUBBER SHOES.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.601
SO YOU'RE THE
REAL MCCOY, HUH?

14:31.133 --> 14:33.067
AM I IN
OR WHAT?

14:33.167 --> 14:35.400
WE'LL SEE.

14:38.601 --> 14:40.734
LET'S HAVE A DRINK, STATIC.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.033
WHAT HAPPENED
THERE, MAN?

14:45.133 --> 14:47.534
YOU REALLY HAD ME
SCARED FOR A MINUTE.

14:47.634 --> 14:49.033
REALLY?

14:50.601 --> 14:52.033
NAH.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.100
[Makes sound effect]

14:58.767 --> 15:00.000
I DON'T LIKE
THIS, LEX.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.267
HE'S OUTTA CONTROL.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.634
WELL, HE'S
SUPPOSED TO BE.

15:02.734 --> 15:04.467
IF HE ACTED ANY DIFFERENT,
HE'D NEVER EARN THEIR TRUST.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.033
THAT MAKES ME
FEEL BETTER.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.300
YOU KNOW, UNTIL
I KNOW HE'S SAFE

15:07.400 --> 15:09.100
I'M NOT LETTING HIM
OUT OF MY SIGHT.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.400
OKAY.

15:10.501 --> 15:13.601
I THINK I'VE FINALLY GOT
AN ID ON OUR MYSTERY MAN.

15:13.701 --> 15:15.434
MICHAEL HAYES.

15:15.534 --> 15:16.667
I KNEW YOU
COULD DO IT!

15:16.767 --> 15:17.834
WHO IS HE?

15:17.934 --> 15:19.267
WELL, THAT'S WHERE IT
GETS A LITTLE WEIRD.

15:19.367 --> 15:21.834
SOMEBODY'S ACTUALLY TAKEN TIME
TO DELETE ALL HIS RECORDS.

15:21.934 --> 15:24.133
IT'S AS IF HE
NEVER EVEN EXISTED.

15:24.234 --> 15:29.234
WHOEVER'S PULLING THIS GUY'S
STRINGS RUNS DEEP, LEXA.

15:29.334 --> 15:31.567
LIKE, DOMINION DEEP?

15:33.267 --> 15:36.701
COLE TELLS ME YOU CAN GET PAST
JUST ABOUT ANY SECURITY SYSTEM.

15:36.801 --> 15:40.334
YEAH, COLE TELLS YOU
THAT, IT MUST BE TRUE.

15:40.434 --> 15:42.067
YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY
TO MESS WITH ME?

15:42.167 --> 15:43.234
NO, THAT'S
NOT IT.

15:43.334 --> 15:44.834
IT'S JUST,
UH...

15:44.934 --> 15:46.367
I MESS WITH
EVERYONE.

15:46.467 --> 15:47.868
CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

15:47.968 --> 15:51.734
YOU SHOULD BE THINKING
ABOUT HELPING YOURSELF.

15:55.033 --> 15:56.300
HOW'S IT
GOING THERE?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.033
PARTY CENTRAL.

15:58.133 --> 16:00.067
BRENNAN'S DEFINITELY
IN CHARACTER.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.901
I KNOW A FEW GUYS
IN LOWER STATE.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.801
OH, RIGHT,
POP QUIZ.

16:04.901 --> 16:06.067
ALL RIGHT, JUST
RELAX, BREN,

16:06.167 --> 16:07.400
I'M LOOKING
INTO IT.

16:07.501 --> 16:11.133
JOHN TINNER,
WARREN STOKER.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.300
[LAUGHS] SORRY...

16:16.400 --> 16:17.834
EVERY TIME I
SEE COLE, MAN,

16:17.934 --> 16:20.000
HE'S ALWAYS FISHING
WAY OUT OF HIS LEAGUE.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.434
COME ON, JESS.

16:21.534 --> 16:23.334
ALMOST THERE.

16:23.434 --> 16:24.534
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT.

16:24.634 --> 16:25.567
CHECKS OUT.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.267
THEY'RE BOTH IN
CELL BLOCK C.

16:27.367 --> 16:30.133
TINNER'S IN FOR
DOUBLE HOMICIDE...

16:30.234 --> 16:32.734
STOKER ALREADY SERVED TEN
YEARS FOR GRAND LARCENY.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.300
YEAH, YEAH.
THOSE GUYS...

16:34.400 --> 16:36.300
SERVED SOME TIME
WITH THEM ON C BLOCK.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.133
NOT LIKE TINNER'S GETTING OUT
OF THERE ANY TIME SOON,

16:38.234 --> 16:40.067
YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN?

16:41.968 --> 16:44.968
HIS HOT WIFE
STILL VISITING HIM?

16:45.067 --> 16:47.300
I DON'T KNOW.
NEVER SAW HER.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.167
HE MUST'VE TALKED
ABOUT HER.

16:49.267 --> 16:51.400
AFTER WHAT
SHE DID.

16:51.501 --> 16:52.400
I'M LOOKING
INTO IT.

16:52.501 --> 16:54.434
STALL HIM,
BRENNAN.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.734
COME ON,
CHECK THIS OUT.

17:13.634 --> 17:15.367
WHAT'D YOU HEAR
ABOUT HER?

17:15.467 --> 17:17.867
JESS, ANY TIME
WOULD BE GOOD.

17:17.968 --> 17:19.200
I'M COMING UP
WITH NOTHING.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.233
HEY, ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

17:28.601 --> 17:29.934
[Adam]
SHE DIVORCED HIM.

17:30.033 --> 17:33.100
AFTER SHE TESTIFIED AGAINST
HIM AT HIS PAROLE HEARING.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.267
MAN,
THE BITCH.

17:34.367 --> 17:35.400
SHE ROLLED ON HIM DURING
THE PAROLE HEARING,

17:35.501 --> 17:37.434
AND THEN JUST
DIVORCED HIS ASS.

17:41.968 --> 17:43.934
HOW'D HE COME
UP WITH THAT?

17:44.033 --> 17:46.133
GUESS HE GOT
LUCKY THIS TIME.

17:46.234 --> 17:48.701
WHEN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION,

17:48.801 --> 17:52.234
DON'T PLAY GAMES
WITH ME, UNDERSTAND?

17:52.334 --> 17:53.767
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YOU GOT IT.

17:53.868 --> 17:55.934
GOOD.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.534
YOU'RE IN.

17:57.634 --> 17:59.400
I'M IN.
[LAUGHS]

17:59.501 --> 18:02.300
THANKS, MAN.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.467
MICHAEL HAYES WAS WORKING
FOR YOU, WASN'T HE?

18:04.567 --> 18:07.100
<i>HE USED TO BE ONE OF
OUR OPERATIVES, YES.</i>

18:07.200 --> 18:09.200
BUT HE'S NO
LONGER A CONCERN.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.868
IN OTHER WORDS,
HE'S DEAD.

18:11.968 --> 18:13.801
THE INFORMATION
ON THAT DISK

18:13.901 --> 18:15.968
THREATENS THE DOMINION'S
SURVIVAL.

18:16.067 --> 18:19.667
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO HE WAS
TRYING TO SELL THAT DISK TO.

18:19.767 --> 18:21.901
RIGHT NOW, MR. MULWRAY
IS OUR BEST BET

18:22.000 --> 18:24.367
AT FINDING THE
IDENTITY OF THE BUYER.

18:26.033 --> 18:28.501
WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.567
HEY, JESS,
YOU THERE?

18:31.667 --> 18:32.767
YEAH, WHAT'VE
YOU GOT?

18:32.868 --> 18:34.200
NOTHING
YET.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.834
ETHAN'S GOING TO GET A CALL ON
HIS CELLPHONE AT SIX O'CLOCK

18:35.934 --> 18:37.400
TO LET HIM KNOW WHEN
THE JOB'S GOING DOWN.

18:37.501 --> 18:39.434
OKAY, I'M GOING TO NEED
YOU TO CLONE HIS CELLPHONE.

18:39.534 --> 18:40.567
I'LL OPEN UP A FREE
CHANNEL ON YOUR COMLINK.

18:40.667 --> 18:41.734
THINK YOU CAN
MANAGE THAT?

18:41.834 --> 18:43.100
YEAH,
I CAN TRY.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.467
GOOD.

18:44.567 --> 18:45.868
YOU OKAY?

18:48.601 --> 18:50.801
GETTING BETTER
ALL THE TIME.

19:06.734 --> 19:08.534
CLONING THE PHONE
NOW, YOU GETTING THIS?

19:08.634 --> 19:11.167
YEAH,

19:17.267 --> 19:19.667
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

19:23.501 --> 19:25.267
WHAT,
ARE YOU NUTS?

19:25.367 --> 19:27.234
TRYING TO LIFT
ETHAN'S WALLET?

19:27.334 --> 19:29.400
IF HE FINDS OUT ABOUT
THAT, YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.501
I'M NOT TRYING TO
LIFT HIS WALLET, MAN.

19:30.601 --> 19:31.767
I'M JUST...

19:31.868 --> 19:33.567
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO IT
IS THAT I'M DEALING WITH.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.367
WELL, ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS THAT I VOUCHED FOR YOU.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.801
WHICH MEANS YOU SCREW
UP, IT'S MY ASS.

19:38.901 --> 19:40.734
FINE.

19:40.834 --> 19:44.367
OKAY, GET YOUR
STUFF TOGETHER.

19:44.467 --> 19:45.868
WE GOT A
JOB TO DO.

19:45.968 --> 19:47.033
YEAH?

19:47.133 --> 19:48.934
GOTTA BOOST AN
ARMOURED CAR.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.734
HOPE YOU'RE
NOT TOO RUSTY.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.200
IT'S LIKE
RIDING A BIKE.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.067
[LAUGHS]

20:03.167 --> 20:04.033
WHO ARE
YOU GUYS?

20:04.133 --> 20:04.901
BOB THE
BUILDER.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.167
AND YES
HE CAN.

20:06.267 --> 20:07.300
AGAINST
THE TRUCK.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.834
LOOK, THE
TRUCK'S EMPTY.

20:16.567 --> 20:18.100
SHOOT HIM!
HE CAN I.D. YOU.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.234
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

20:19.334 --> 20:20.267
SHOOT HIM!

20:20.367 --> 20:21.868
HEY, HEY,

20:27.400 --> 20:28.734
COME ON!

20:45.467 --> 20:46.434
YOU ZAPPED

20:46.534 --> 20:48.267
WE HAVE
PROBLEMS.

20:48.367 --> 20:50.334
YOU LEFT A LOOSE
END OUT THERE.

20:50.434 --> 20:51.100
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:51.200 --> 20:52.200
THE GUARD?

20:52.300 --> 20:53.000
NO, NO, LOOK...

20:53.100 --> 20:54.067
THAT WAS ME.

20:54.167 --> 20:55.901
HEY, IT WAS
MY DECISION.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.601
I HAVE RULES
OF ENGAGEMENT.

20:57.701 --> 20:58.801
WELL, SORRY.

20:58.901 --> 21:00.901
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE ADDING
MURDER TO MY RAP SHEET.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.033
LOOK, I FRIED THE GUY.

21:02.133 --> 21:04.267
HE'S NOT GOING TO REMEMBER
THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

21:04.367 --> 21:05.200
JUST...

21:05.300 --> 21:06.300
CHILL OUT,
ALL RIGHT, MAN.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.334
RELAX.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.767
RELAX.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.000
NO ONE
TELLS ME TO RELAX.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.667
I MAKE THE RULES.

21:15.767 --> 21:17.234
ANYONE GETS IN
OUR WAY, HE DIES.

21:17.334 --> 21:18.801
YOU UNDERSTAND?

21:18.901 --> 21:20.701
YEAH.

21:21.834 --> 21:22.934
I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

21:23.033 --> 21:23.968
I'LL...

21:24.067 --> 21:25.968
DO IT YOUR
WAY NEXT TIME.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.033
AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THAT, BRENNAN.

21:28.133 --> 21:29.834
THAT WAS MY
FAULT OUT THERE.

21:29.934 --> 21:31.467
MAN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH THESE GUYS?

21:31.567 --> 21:32.434
THEY'RE
KILLERS.

21:32.534 --> 21:33.601
I KNOW.

21:33.701 --> 21:35.767
AND THIS IS MY
LAST JOB, MAN.

21:35.868 --> 21:37.133
I'M SERIOUS.

21:37.234 --> 21:38.667
I'M DONE, MAN.

21:38.767 --> 21:40.734
I DON'T HAVE THE STOMACH
FOR THIS ANYMORE.

21:40.834 --> 21:42.868
RIGHT,
THEN WALK.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.968
I CAN'T.

21:45.067 --> 21:46.467
YOU KIDDING ME?

21:46.567 --> 21:50.133
AFTER THIS, I'LL HAVE ENOUGH
SCRATCH TO OPEN MY OWN BAR.

21:50.234 --> 21:51.133
OH, COLE...

21:51.234 --> 21:52.634
DON'T YOU
LAUGH AT ME.

21:52.734 --> 21:55.300
THAT'S SOMETHING I WANTED
TO DO FOR A LONG TIME.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.434
OKAY LISTEN, YOU GET
OUT RIGHT NOW,

21:59.534 --> 22:01.100
I WILL GIVE YOU HALF
OF MY TAKE ON THIS.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.601
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA... WHAT'S UP?

22:02.701 --> 22:03.634
I MEAN, FIRST...

22:03.734 --> 22:05.534
YOU'RE BEGGING ME
TO GET YOU IN,

22:05.634 --> 22:09.300
AND NOW YOU'RE
TRYING TO PULL ME OUT?

22:09.400 --> 22:11.734
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

22:14.734 --> 22:15.567
FORGET IT.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.367
JUST DO IT
YOUR WAY.

22:33.834 --> 22:35.400
HI.
MRS. HAYES?

22:35.501 --> 22:37.801
I'M LEXA
PIERCE.

22:37.901 --> 22:39.801
I WANTED TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

22:39.901 --> 22:42.467
I TOLD THE
OTHERS ALL I KNOW.

22:42.567 --> 22:44.834
WHY CAN'T YOU PEOPLE
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?

22:44.934 --> 22:48.067
WAIT A MINUTE...
WHAT OTHERS?

22:48.167 --> 22:49.167
THE DOMINION?

22:49.267 --> 22:52.067
WHO'S THE DOMINION?

22:52.167 --> 22:53.901
IT'S WHO YOUR HUSBAND
USED TO WORK FOR.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.167
MY HUSBAND WORKED FOR
A CHEMICAL COMPANY.

22:57.267 --> 23:00.634
NOW WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

23:00.734 --> 23:02.334
I BELIEVE YOUR HUSBAND WAS
STEALING INFORMATION

23:02.434 --> 23:05.434
FROM THE DOMINION
AND TRYING TO SELL IT.

23:05.534 --> 23:07.567
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:07.667 --> 23:09.634
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

23:09.734 --> 23:11.934
YEAH, AND
NOW HE'S DEAD.

23:12.033 --> 23:13.701
MRS. HAYES, I'M
ONLY TRYING TO HELP

23:13.801 --> 23:16.334
AND YOU NEED TO TELL ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

23:16.434 --> 23:18.300
WHAT FOR?

23:18.400 --> 23:21.033
WILL THAT BRING
MY HUSBAND BACK?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.834
BRENNAN REALLY
FRIED THAT GUARD.

23:24.934 --> 23:28.734
HE'S STILL IN
INTENSIVE CARE.

23:28.834 --> 23:31.334
THEY WOULD'VE POPPED
HIM IN A HEARTBEAT.

23:31.434 --> 23:32.968
MY GUESS IS BRENNAN
SAVED HIS LIFE.

23:33.067 --> 23:34.334
WHY ARE YOU
DEFENDING HIM?

23:34.434 --> 23:35.601
HE'S IN
OVER HIS HEAD.

23:35.701 --> 23:37.367
I'M SURE BRENNAN HAD
REASONS TO DO WHAT HE DID.

23:37.467 --> 23:40.267
SHALIMAR, BRENNAN KNEW THIS JOB
WAS DANGEROUS WHEN HE TOOK IT.

23:40.367 --> 23:41.634
OKAY, SO WHY
DIDN'T HE TELL US

23:41.734 --> 23:43.167
THE ARMOURED TRUCK
JOB WAS GOING DOWN?

23:43.267 --> 23:45.534
MAYBE HE COULDN'T.

23:45.634 --> 23:47.067
YOU'RE MAKING
EXCUSES FOR HIM.

23:47.167 --> 23:48.601
HE'S PLAYING
THE PART.

23:48.701 --> 23:50.767
YEAH, A PART THAT
MIGHT GET HIM KILLED.

23:50.868 --> 23:51.868
[Ringing]

23:51.968 --> 23:53.234
RIGHT ON TIME.

23:54.434 --> 23:57.067
BUYER'S MADE
CONTACT.

23:57.167 --> 23:59.100
I CAN'T ACCESS
THE AUDIO SIGNAL.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.434
UH, MAYBE IT'S
A TEXT MESSAGE.

24:01.534 --> 24:03.267
CAN YOU DECIPHER IT?

24:03.367 --> 24:05.567
NO. IT'S ENCRYPTED.

24:05.667 --> 24:07.434
PLEASE TELL ME WE'RE
NOT AT A DEAD END.

24:07.534 --> 24:08.634
NOT QUITE.

24:08.734 --> 24:10.133
I'M TRYING TO LOCK INTO
THE SATELLITE SIGNAL.

24:10.234 --> 24:12.133
CAN YOU GET A TRACE ON
THE BUYER'S LOCATION?

24:12.234 --> 24:13.300
YOU GOT IT.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.167
OKAY, WELL, PATCH IT
THROUGH THE HELIX.

24:15.267 --> 24:17.033
LET'S GO.

24:23.100 --> 24:26.200
AS SOON AS WE GRAB THE BUYER,
WE'RE PULLING BRENNAN OUT.

24:27.100 --> 24:30.367
OKAY,
LET'S DO THIS.

24:42.701 --> 24:44.834
YOU'RE UP,
STATIC.

24:44.934 --> 24:46.400
COOL.

24:46.501 --> 24:48.067
HERE'S WHAT WE GOT.

24:50.067 --> 24:51.133
WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING AT?

24:51.234 --> 24:52.968
CAPITAL BANK.

24:53.067 --> 24:55.133
I NEED YOU TO GET
US INSIDE THE VAULT.

24:55.234 --> 24:57.167
TRIGGER LOCK'S
MAGNETICALLY CONTROLLED.

24:57.267 --> 24:58.434
HUH, PIECE OF CAKE.

24:58.534 --> 25:00.367
OH, IT BETTER BE.

25:00.467 --> 25:01.801
YOU JUST HOLD
UP YOUR END, NICK.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.501
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF MINE.

25:03.601 --> 25:06.634
OKAY, WE ENTER THROUGH
THE SIDE ENTRANCE.

25:06.734 --> 25:08.634
THAT'S WHERE THE ARMOURED
TRUCK DOES ITS PICKUP.

25:08.734 --> 25:10.601
AT THE SECURITY STATION,
COLE'LL HANG BACK

25:10.701 --> 25:11.934
TO DISTRACT THE GUARD.

25:12.033 --> 25:13.400
DOWN THE ELEVATOR WE'LL
BE MET BY A MANAGER

25:13.501 --> 25:15.167
WHO GETS US THROUGH
TO THE VAULT.

25:15.267 --> 25:16.501
THAT'S WHERE
I TAKE OVER.

25:16.601 --> 25:17.767
YOU GOT TWO MINUTES

25:17.868 --> 25:19.801
BEFORE THE GUARDS MAKE
THEIR AUTOMATIC SWEEP.

25:19.901 --> 25:23.901
YOU MESS UP, THE WHOLE AREA
SEALS OFF WITH US INSIDE.

25:24.934 --> 25:26.834
I'LL GO GET
THE TRUCK READY.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.934
YO, STATIC.

25:33.033 --> 25:36.300
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
REMEMBER THIS TIME?

25:36.400 --> 25:38.968
RULES OF
ENGAGEMENT.

25:45.701 --> 25:48.434
YOU LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE?

25:49.834 --> 25:52.634
DON'T TRY TO TALK COLE
OUT OF DOING THIS JOB.

25:52.734 --> 25:53.801
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO PULL HIM OUT.

25:53.901 --> 25:54.934
PULL HIM OUT NOW,

25:55.033 --> 25:55.868
THE WHOLE JOB COULD
BE COMPROMISED.

25:55.968 --> 25:57.167
ETHAN'S ALREADY JUMPY.

25:57.267 --> 25:58.200
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO DO, ADAM?

25:58.300 --> 25:59.367
JUST TURN MY BACK
ON MY FRIENDS?

25:59.467 --> 26:00.501
YOUR FRIEND'S
ALREADY INVOLVED

26:00.601 --> 26:02.567
AND IT'S TOO LATE TO
TRY TO PROTECT HIM.

26:02.667 --> 26:04.868
YOUR ALLEGIANCE SHOULD BE TO
ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY:

26:04.968 --> 26:06.234
MUTANT X.

26:06.334 --> 26:08.901
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANOTHER
CHANCE TO GET THIS DISK.

26:11.601 --> 26:14.601
YEAH, I GUESS YOU BETTER
KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.901
OKAY, IT LOOKS LIKE THE BUYER'S
SIGNAL'S COMING FROM AN ALLEY

26:23.000 --> 26:24.901
BETWEEN LANCASTER AND DWYER.

26:25.033 --> 26:26.033
HE'S ON THE MOVE.

26:26.133 --> 26:27.868
LET'S BRING IT DOWN.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.167
WHICH WAY?

26:35.267 --> 26:36.868
I KNOW HE'S HERE.

26:36.968 --> 26:39.334
HOW CLOSE?

26:42.534 --> 26:45.434
OH, YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

26:52.133 --> 26:53.267
SPICY
KUNG PAO?

26:53.367 --> 26:55.534
I'M SORRY?

26:55.634 --> 26:56.767
WHERE'D YOU
GET THIS?

26:56.868 --> 26:58.767
I FOUND IT.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.100
I SWEAR.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.000
SOMEONE LEFT IT ON THE
COUNTER AT THE RESTAURANT.

27:04.567 --> 27:06.067
ALL RIGHT.
BEAT IT.

27:08.868 --> 27:09.968
[SIGHS] GREAT.

27:10.067 --> 27:11.467
JESS, WE'RE
AT A DEAD END.

27:11.567 --> 27:13.200
OUR BUYER'S
LONG GONE.

27:13.300 --> 27:15.534
WELL, THEN WE'RE OUT
OF LUCK ON ALL FRONTS.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.868
BRENNAN'S CUT US OFF.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.167
HE TOOK OFF HIS COMLINK.

27:18.267 --> 27:19.934
SO MUCH FOR "EVERY DAY
STARTS WITH A SMILE".

27:20.033 --> 27:21.400
HE'S IN OVER
HIS HEAD.

27:21.501 --> 27:23.000
HE'S NOT
THINKING RIGHT.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.601
I'M STARTING
TO BELIEVE YOU.

27:24.701 --> 27:26.267
LET'S GO.

27:27.667 --> 27:29.234
COLE, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING, MAN?

27:29.334 --> 27:31.234
AH, IT'S JUST A
LITTLE KICKSTARTER.

27:31.334 --> 27:32.634
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:32.734 --> 27:34.100
WE NEED A CLEAR HEAD
TODAY, ALL RIGHT?

27:34.200 --> 27:35.367
WHO ARE YOU,
MY MOTHER?

27:35.467 --> 27:37.133
I CAN TAKE
CARE OF MYSELF.

27:37.234 --> 27:38.133
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

27:38.234 --> 27:39.300
YOU JUST NEED
TO KEEP A CLEAN HEAD

27:39.400 --> 27:41.734
AND STAY OFF
THE JUICE, ALL RIGHT?

27:46.367 --> 27:48.367
BRENNAN!

27:48.467 --> 27:51.567
YOU'RE OUT!

27:51.667 --> 27:54.000
WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL ME?

27:57.701 --> 28:00.434
YOU SAID YOU
LOVED ME.

28:00.534 --> 28:01.334
WHAT ARE YOU...

28:01.434 --> 28:02.501
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, BABY?

28:02.601 --> 28:03.434
YEAH.

28:03.534 --> 28:05.667
OF COURSE,
I LOVE YA.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.267
UH, JUST SPENDING A LITTLE
TIME WITH MY BOY, HERE,

28:08.367 --> 28:10.033
HAVING A DRINK.

28:10.133 --> 28:11.834
YOU KNOW YOU'RE AT
THE TOP OF MY LIST.

28:11.934 --> 28:13.133
LIST?

28:13.234 --> 28:15.934
I AM NOT ON ANYBODY'S
LIST, ALL RIGHT?

28:16.033 --> 28:17.033
OH, HO.

28:17.133 --> 28:19.868
BURNED YOU,
BRO. [LAUGHS]

28:19.968 --> 28:21.601
LISTEN, C'MERE
FOR A SEC.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.868
[LAUGHS]

28:30.234 --> 28:31.634
THE NEXT TIME YOU DECIDE
TO LEAVE MUTANT X

28:31.734 --> 28:33.701
I'D APPRECIATE TWO
WEEKS' NOTICE.

28:33.801 --> 28:34.801
OKAY, I DIDN'T LEAVE.

28:34.901 --> 28:36.200
THINGS ARE GETTING A
LITTLE COMPLICATED.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.601
I DIDN'T NEED YOU GUYS
SCREWING THINGS UP.

28:37.701 --> 28:39.601
SHAL THINKS YOU'RE A
LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL.

28:39.701 --> 28:41.133
SHE THINKS YOU AND COLE
DO THINGS,

28:41.234 --> 28:43.567
CRAZY THINGS,
JUST FOR THE RUSH.

28:44.467 --> 28:45.567
DID YOU TAKE A
GOOD LOOK AT HIM?

28:45.667 --> 28:46.734
DID YOU REALLY LOOK
AT HIM CLOSELY,

28:46.834 --> 28:48.567
HE'S NOT THE
SAME MAN.

28:48.667 --> 28:50.300
FINE.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.868
BUT YOU'RE NOT DOING
THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN.

28:52.968 --> 28:55.834
WHEN IT'S MY NECK
ON THE LINE, I AM.

28:55.934 --> 28:56.901
ETHAN'S A
LOOSE CANNON,

28:57.000 --> 28:58.701
AND YOU NEED TO
GET OUTTA HERE.

29:07.934 --> 29:12.367
AND YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW.

29:12.467 --> 29:14.400
ALL RIGHT.

29:14.501 --> 29:18.000
HOT DEAL'S
GOING DOWN TONIGHT.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.334
YOUR TURN.

29:20.434 --> 29:22.167
THE DOMINION KILLED
MICHAEL HAYES

29:22.267 --> 29:24.634
BECAUSE OF WHAT'S
ON THAT DISK.

29:24.734 --> 29:26.834
NOW YOU NEED TO GET
ETHAN TO TAKE THE DISK,

29:26.934 --> 29:29.400
LEAD US TO THE BUYER,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

29:29.501 --> 29:32.734
YOU'RE ACTUALLY, UH,
TRUSTING ME ON THIS ONE?

29:32.834 --> 29:36.734
TRUST IS A
TWO-WAY STREET, OKAY?

29:36.834 --> 29:38.000
BRENNAN.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.434
COME ON, MAN,
WE GOTTA GO.

29:40.534 --> 29:43.033
YOU CAN DEAL
WITH THIS LATER.

29:49.501 --> 29:51.300
YOU'RE A LOUSY KISSER,
YOU KNOW THAT?

29:51.400 --> 29:53.067
HUH...

29:53.167 --> 29:54.901
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

29:58.701 --> 29:59.701
ONE DAY.

29:59.801 --> 30:00.901
YOU'RE OUT OF
THE JOINT ONE DAY

30:01.000 --> 30:02.400
AND YOU'RE ALREADY
GETTING MORE TAIL THAN ME.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.968
I HATE YOU.

30:04.067 --> 30:05.234
[LAUGHS]
BABY, I LOVE YOU.

30:42.834 --> 30:44.400
[Buzz]

30:46.300 --> 30:47.133
HURRY UP!

30:47.234 --> 30:48.901
IT'S COLD
OUT HERE.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.067
[Buzzer]

31:04.367 --> 31:05.300
THANKS.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.701
TELL DOWNSTAIRS
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

31:06.801 --> 31:08.100
YOU GOT IT.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.467
THEY'RE
HEADING DOWN.

31:24.467 --> 31:25.601
YOU'RE EARLY.

31:25.701 --> 31:26.767
WE'RE SHORT
SOME PEOPLE.

31:26.868 --> 31:29.601
WE HAD TO DOUBLE UP
ON THE SCHEDULES.

31:47.701 --> 31:49.734
I'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

31:54.133 --> 31:56.434
LOOK, I DON'T
WANT ANY TROUBLE!

31:56.534 --> 31:59.200
WELL, YOU TELL THEM THERE
WAS A CAMERA MALFUNCTION.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.868
DO IT NOW
OR DIE.

32:04.167 --> 32:05.601
EVERYTHING'S
FINE.

32:05.701 --> 32:06.901
MUST BE A
COMPUTER GLITCH.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
I'LL FINISH UP
WITH THESE GUYS

32:08.100 --> 32:09.734
AND PUT A CALL
INTO TECH SUPPORT.

32:09.834 --> 32:10.701
OKAY.

32:10.801 --> 32:12.234
ALL RIGHT.

32:14.734 --> 32:16.234
I CAN'T
OPEN THE VAULT.

32:16.334 --> 32:17.400
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

32:17.501 --> 32:19.100
I GOT IT
COVERED.

32:27.834 --> 32:29.434
FINISH IT.

32:38.000 --> 32:38.767
LET'S MOVE.

32:38.868 --> 32:40.300
WE GOT TWO MINUTES.

32:44.434 --> 32:46.901
WHAT'S THE
PROBLEM?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.434
THESE MECHANISMS
ARE DELICATE.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.901
IT'S NOT AS
EASY AS IT LOOKS.

33:00.968 --> 33:01.834
OOPS.

33:01.934 --> 33:03.133
I THINK I
MIGHTA BROKE IT.

33:03.234 --> 33:04.267
[LAUGHS]

33:04.367 --> 33:05.968
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

33:16.834 --> 33:20.334
OKAY, ONE,
TWO, THREE.

33:26.934 --> 33:28.767
THAT'S IT.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.000
WHERE'S
STATIC?

33:33.100 --> 33:34.567
I TOLD YOU
HE WAS NO GOOD, ETH.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.801
LET'S GO!

33:39.634 --> 33:42.434
WHERE YOU GOING,
NICK?

33:43.968 --> 33:45.467
YOU BASTARD.

33:45.567 --> 33:47.267
DON'T TAKE
IT PERSONALLY.

33:56.968 --> 34:00.400
[LAUGHING]

34:00.501 --> 34:02.200
COME ON, LET'S GO.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.267
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

34:04.367 --> 34:05.934
WE GOTTA GET
OUTTA HERE.

34:09.333 --> 34:10.701
FORGOT SOMETHING
IN THE TRUCK.

34:10.801 --> 34:12.501
BE RIGHT BACK.

34:16.601 --> 34:19.300
[WHISTLING]

34:22.033 --> 34:23.734
YOU HEARD ANYTHING
FROM BRENNAN YET?

34:23.833 --> 34:25.100
NO, NOTHING YET.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.501
AND LEXA WANTS TO GIVE HIM A
LITTLE SPACE IN THIS ONE, SO...

34:27.601 --> 34:28.734
LEXA SAID THAT?

34:28.833 --> 34:29.801
YEAH.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.234
OH, SHE TOOK OFF,

34:31.333 --> 34:33.000
TO GO PRESSURE
MICHAEL HAYES' WIDOW.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.833
SHE THINKS SHE KNOWS
MORE THAN SHE'S SAYING.

34:34.934 --> 34:35.868
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:35.967 --> 34:38.199
TRACKING BRENNAN'S COMLINK.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.067
ALREADY GIVEN
HIM ENOUGH ROPE.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.868
WHAT THE HELL JUST
HAPPENED BACK THERE?

34:45.967 --> 34:47.900
ETHAN'S WHACKED. HE JUST
TRIED TO DOUBLE CROSS US.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.634
NO, MAN, NO.

34:49.734 --> 34:51.467
NO, I DON'T
THINK SO.

34:51.567 --> 34:52.434
LISTEN TO ME!

34:52.534 --> 34:53.567
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO EXPLAIN.

34:53.667 --> 34:55.333
YOU JUST NEED TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

34:55.434 --> 34:57.033
GO!

34:57.132 --> 34:59.033
I DON'T
THINK SO.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.234
HE WAS GOING
TO KILL YOU.

35:05.334 --> 35:06.300
THAT WAS ALWAYS
THE PLAN.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.901
BULL...
- HE JUST KILLED NICK.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.367
YOU WERE NEXT.

35:10.467 --> 35:11.634
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND.

35:11.734 --> 35:12.934
YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING
BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:13.033 --> 35:14.901
YOU DON'T HAVE THE STOMACH
FOR THIS ANYMORE, MAN.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.067
YOU NEED TO GET
OUT OF THE GAME.

35:20.634 --> 35:23.000
THIS IS SO
MESSED UP, MAN.

35:23.100 --> 35:24.734
IT'S SO
MESSED UP.

35:24.834 --> 35:26.167
I KNOW.

35:26.267 --> 35:27.267
I KNOW.

35:27.367 --> 35:29.667
GIVE ME THE GUN.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.467
GIVE ME THE GUN.

35:39.234 --> 35:40.634
OKAY, YOU NEED TO TELL
ME WHERE HE'S GOING.

35:40.734 --> 35:41.501
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

35:41.601 --> 35:42.734
YOU WERE THE DRIVER, MAN.

35:42.834 --> 35:43.767
HE'S GOT TO TELL YOU
WHERE HE'S GOING.

35:43.868 --> 35:44.767
I DON'T KNOW.

35:44.868 --> 35:46.000
I'LL HELP YOU
GET OUT OF THIS

35:46.100 --> 35:47.501
BUT YOU HAVE TO TELL
ME WHERE HE WENT.

35:47.601 --> 35:48.567
DAMMIT, COLE!

35:48.667 --> 35:49.868
HE JUST
KILLED NICK.

35:49.968 --> 35:53.033
RIGHT NOW, HE'S GETTING
AWAY WITH YOUR MONEY.

35:55.734 --> 35:58.434
HE'S AT A
PARKING LOT. OKAY?

35:58.534 --> 35:59.767
FOURTH AND CENTURY,
AND THAT'S IT.

35:59.868 --> 36:01.300
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.868
OKAY, I'M GOING
TO GO HANDLE THIS.

36:03.968 --> 36:05.234
WHEN I'M DONE,
I'LL CALL YOU.

36:05.334 --> 36:06.868
WE'LL MEET UP.

36:15.734 --> 36:17.734
MRS. HAYES...

36:17.834 --> 36:19.334
I TOLD YOU,
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

36:19.434 --> 36:21.367
YOUR HUSBAND MUST
HAVE SAID SOMETHING TO YOU

36:21.467 --> 36:23.367
ABOUT WHAT HE
WAS INVOLVED IN.

36:23.467 --> 36:25.567
NOW, LISTEN, MY FRIEND IS
PUTTING HIS LIFE ON THE LINE

36:25.667 --> 36:27.000
FOR WHAT YOUR
HUSBAND STARTED.

36:27.100 --> 36:30.634
I AM NOT LEAVING HERE UNTIL YOU
TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

36:34.734 --> 36:38.167
HE WAS TERRIFIED
FOR HIS LIFE.

36:38.267 --> 36:41.400
HE FOUND PROOF OF CORRUPTION
WITHIN THE AGENCY.

36:41.501 --> 36:42.968
OH, THAT'S
NOT POSSIBLE.

36:43.067 --> 36:46.501
I TOLD HIM TO LOOK THE
OTHER WAY, BUT HE COULDN'T.

36:46.601 --> 36:48.667
HE HAD TO
BLOW THE WHISTLE.

36:48.767 --> 36:53.200
SAID HE COULDN'T LIVE
WITH HIMSELF OTHERWISE.

36:53.300 --> 36:56.300
SO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE DISK?

36:56.400 --> 37:00.467
WELL, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO
HE WAS TRYING TO GET IT TO?

37:00.567 --> 37:02.901
I WISH TO
GOD I DID.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.968
ALL I KNOW IS, HE WAS TRYING
TO GET IT TO SOMEONE

37:06.067 --> 37:09.300
HE SAID HE
COULD TRUST.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.367
NICE SHOT.

38:07.033 --> 38:09.000
WHAT HAPPENED?

38:09.100 --> 38:11.400
THE BUYER
GOT AWAY.

38:11.501 --> 38:14.300
WHAT ABOUT
THE DISK?

38:14.400 --> 38:16.534
FRIED IT.

38:42.300 --> 38:47.901
THOSE ARE MY RULES
OF ENGAGEMENT.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.467
WELL, BRENNAN MANAGED
TO DESTROY THE DISK

38:49.567 --> 38:51.200
BEFORE THE
BUYER GOT AWAY.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.434
BUT I'M AFRAID HE WASN'T
ABLE TO IDENTIFY HIM.

38:53.534 --> 38:55.200
HOW COULD YOU
LET THIS HAPPEN?

38:55.300 --> 38:56.734
OUR ORDERS
WERE VERY CLEAR.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.100
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.868
BRENNAN'S ORDERS CHANGED THE
MOMENT THE MISSION DEMANDED IT.

39:00.968 --> 39:02.467
YOU KNOW, HE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH
TO GET OUT OF THERE ALIVE,

39:02.567 --> 39:05.133
NEVER MIND
DESTROY THE DISK.

39:05.234 --> 39:06.834
GEEZ, IT WOULDN'T KILL
YOU TO PAT US ON THE BACK

39:06.934 --> 39:09.501
EVERY ONCE IN A
WHILE, YOU KNOW?

39:09.601 --> 39:13.834
TELL MR. MULWRAY THE DOMINION
APPRECIATES HIS EFFORTS.

39:13.934 --> 39:15.033
WELL, YOU SEE?

39:15.133 --> 39:17.567
NOW THAT DIDN'T
HURT, DID IT?

39:20.667 --> 39:23.000
WHAT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND,

39:23.100 --> 39:27.200
WHY DID BRENNAN
DESTROY THAT DISK?

39:27.300 --> 39:28.434
I DON'T KNOW.

39:28.534 --> 39:32.033
I'M SURE HE
HAD HIS REASONS.

39:37.400 --> 39:38.834
THERE YOU GO.

39:38.934 --> 39:40.801
THANKS, SWEETIE.

39:50.367 --> 39:52.701
DIDN'T THINK I'D BE
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

39:52.801 --> 39:54.300
EH...

39:54.400 --> 39:56.400
WHAT'S THAT?

39:56.501 --> 39:59.067
CONSIDER THIS
AN INVESTMENT.

39:59.167 --> 40:00.534
SOMEBODY ONCE GAVE
ME A TICKET OUT.

40:00.634 --> 40:02.400
I'M RETURNING
THE FAVOUR.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.501
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO BUY A BAR, RIGHT?

40:05.601 --> 40:06.601
THERE YOU GO.

40:06.701 --> 40:08.667
BUT HOW DID YOU...
- HEY!

40:08.767 --> 40:10.133
NOT SO FAST.

40:10.234 --> 40:12.901
YOU CAN HAVE THIS
ON ONE CONDITION.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.167
YOU GOTTA DISAPPEAR

40:14.267 --> 40:15.601
AND SEVER ALL CONNECTIONS
WITH YOUR OLD LIFE...

40:15.701 --> 40:17.400
AND THAT INCLUDES ME.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.567
OKAY.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.767
I'M STILL GONNA BE
DRINKING ON YOUR DIME.

40:26.868 --> 40:29.067
[LAUGHS]
OLD HABITS DIE HARD.

40:29.167 --> 40:30.534
YOU KNOW IT.

40:30.634 --> 40:32.834
[LAUGHS]
TAKE CARE.

40:32.934 --> 40:34.234
THANK YOU, BRENNAN.

40:34.334 --> 40:35.501
FOR EVERYTHING, MAN.

40:35.601 --> 40:36.701
I MEAN THAT.

40:36.801 --> 40:37.901
YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
BE GOOD.

40:48.534 --> 40:49.734
BRENNAN.

40:49.834 --> 40:52.434
THANKS.

40:52.534 --> 40:55.701
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE THE BUYER
THIS WHOLE TIME.

40:55.801 --> 40:56.868
THAT YOU HIRED
ETHAN'S CREW,

40:56.968 --> 40:58.234
THAT YOU SET THIS
WHOLE THING UP.

40:58.334 --> 41:00.033
I HAD TO
GET THE DISK.

41:00.133 --> 41:01.200
HAYES WAS A
FRIEND OF MINE.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.133
HE WAS KILLED BEFORE
HE COULD GET IT TO ME.

41:03.234 --> 41:06.000
WHICH IS PROOF OF IMPROPRIETY,
HIGH UP WITHIN THE DOMINION.

41:06.100 --> 41:08.067
DID YOU EVEN STOP TO
CONSIDER FOR ONE SECOND

41:08.167 --> 41:10.033
HOW MANY PEOPLE MIGHT GET
CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE?

41:10.133 --> 41:11.501
IT WAS NEVER
MY INTENTION.

41:11.601 --> 41:14.467
I HAD NO IDEA THAT ETHAN WAS
WILLING TO KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE.

41:14.567 --> 41:18.033
AND WOULD THAT HAVE
MADE A DIFFERENCE?

41:20.767 --> 41:23.601
WHAT'S ON THE DISK?

41:23.701 --> 41:25.601
I WAS HOPING TO
FIND SOME ANSWERS.

41:25.701 --> 41:27.534
INSTEAD, I'M LEFT
WITH MORE QUESTIONS.

41:27.634 --> 41:31.200
[LAUGHS]
WELL, AIN'T THAT SWEET.

41:31.300 --> 41:32.234
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME,

41:32.334 --> 41:34.067
THAT THIS WAS IMPORTANT
FOR ALL OF US.

41:34.167 --> 41:36.133
THEN ANSWER ME THIS
QUESTION, ADAM.

41:36.234 --> 41:37.667
WHY'D YOU PICK ME?

41:37.767 --> 41:38.834
HUH?

41:38.934 --> 41:40.434
JUST TO TEST
MY LOYALTIES?

41:40.534 --> 41:41.968
YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD HAVE
PUT YOU IN THIS POSITION

41:42.067 --> 41:43.634
IF THAT WAS EVER IN DOUBT?

41:43.734 --> 41:46.901
OH, THAT'S A NICE WAY
OF AVOIDING MY QUESTION.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.267
ALL RIGHT.

41:49.367 --> 41:51.634
I THINK YOU'RE ALL
IN FOR TOUGH TIMES.

41:51.734 --> 41:54.000
I THINK THAT MUTANT X
IS ABOUT TO BE TESTED.

41:54.100 --> 41:55.801
MAYBE TO THE
BREAKING POINT.

41:55.901 --> 41:57.534
WHO, BY YOU?

41:57.634 --> 41:59.434
THE DOMINION?

41:59.534 --> 42:02.767
WHO?

42:02.868 --> 42:05.167
YOU'LL KNOW
WHEN THE TIME COMES.
