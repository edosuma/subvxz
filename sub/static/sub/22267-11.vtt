Hi, um, Dr. Akopian.
Rebecca Bunch here.

00:20.433 --> 00:23.008
So, Dr. Shin says
it's time for me to transition

00:23.076 --> 00:24.823
from outpatient treatment
with him back to you,

00:24.890 --> 00:27.627
so what do you say?
Our usual time on Thursday?

00:27.695 --> 00:30.486
Give me a buzz.
Buzz! Bee emoticon.

00:30.705 --> 00:33.582
Anyway, I'm feeling good,
ready to dig into all of it...

00:33.650 --> 00:36.215
abandonment issues,
dissociative episodes, my dad.

00:36.283 --> 00:37.371
It's all on the table.

00:37.439 --> 00:39.830

See you soon.

00:40.088 --> 00:41.619
It's happening.

00:42.895 --> 00:47.509
Maybe this time,
it's finally happening.

Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Nathaniel and I Are Just Friends!"</font>

03:13.261 --> 03:14.707
Okay, so, uh,

03:14.775 --> 03:15.958
let me catch you up
on everything

03:16.025 --> 03:17.836
that's been going on with me
since I last saw you,

03:17.903 --> 03:19.671
which was
post-suicide attempt,

03:19.739 --> 03:21.437
and I tried to get you
to give me a new diagnosis.

03:21.504 --> 03:23.457
Right, right.
Okay, so, to recap.

03:23.525 --> 03:25.210
I accepted the fact
that I'm borderline,

03:25.278 --> 03:26.794
did a lot of workbooks,
went to Buffalo,

03:26.861 --> 03:27.890
hung out with
my friend's dad,

03:27.957 --> 03:30.030
got back from Buffalo,
started dating Nathaniel,

03:30.098 --> 03:32.663
got a little too obsessy over
Nathaniel, so broke that off.

03:32.731 --> 03:33.913
Went on a ton
of hormones

03:33.981 --> 03:35.182
to give Darryl an egg,

03:35.250 --> 03:37.416
took over my firm
as senior partner.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.792
Uh, Nathaniel started dating
a new girl, Mona.

03:39.860 --> 03:40.949
That was three weeks ago.

03:41.017 --> 03:43.265
Nathaniel and I had sex
in the office we now share,

03:43.333 --> 03:44.481
decided that was a bad idea,

03:44.549 --> 03:46.390
it should never happen again,
and now I'm here.

03:46.542 --> 03:47.781
Wow.

03:47.849 --> 03:49.941
That's... a lot.

03:51.036 --> 03:52.679
Let's work backwards.

03:52.747 --> 03:56.195
So you and Nathaniel were
intimate, but not any longer?

03:56.266 --> 03:59.039
Oh, God, no, no, no.
No, no, no. That is long over.

03:59.107 --> 04:01.460
I mean, after we had
sex that one time,

04:01.537 --> 04:04.174
we only had sex, like,
three more times that week.

04:04.251 --> 04:05.408
And then we stopped.

04:05.485 --> 04:07.410
Except for last night.

04:07.679 --> 04:08.861
And this morning.

04:08.929 --> 04:10.180
But I don't
count this morning,

04:10.248 --> 04:11.945
because the janitor
opened the door

04:12.013 --> 04:14.115
of the supply closet,
so nobody finished.

04:14.601 --> 04:16.461
Except I'm pretty sure
the janitor.

04:17.023 --> 04:19.656
Are you okay with Nathaniel
seeing another woman?

04:19.725 --> 04:22.525
Listen, Nathaniel and I
are not seeing each other.

04:22.657 --> 04:25.891
Okay? What happened between us
was just a few mistakes

04:25.959 --> 04:28.344
in a-a room full
of office supplies.

04:28.571 --> 04:30.056
Okay? It's done.

04:30.133 --> 04:31.524
It's been hours.

04:31.601 --> 04:33.758
Or what time is it?
It's been 40 minutes.

04:33.881 --> 04:35.657
- Rebecca...
- L-Listen.

04:35.725 --> 04:38.870
The Nathaniel sex... blah,
irrelevant. It's in the past.

04:38.938 --> 04:40.659
I'm here in the present
with you right now

04:40.727 --> 04:42.278
ready to rock my mental health.

04:42.355 --> 04:44.003
So, come on,
let's do this.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.276
Bunch and Akopes,

04:45.344 --> 04:48.274
back together,
tonight on CBS at 9:00 p.m.,

04:48.351 --> 04:51.633
solving crimes in different
climates around the world.

04:52.048 --> 04:54.324
I do not wish
to be called "Akopes."

04:54.401 --> 04:56.449
God, I forgot
how un-fun you are.

04:56.526 --> 04:58.494
It was nice
to be invited, right?

04:58.782 --> 04:59.813
No.

04:59.881 --> 05:01.792
Oh, my God. Wait.
You know Brian, right?

05:01.860 --> 05:03.003
- Oh, Brian.
- Mm-hmm.

05:03.071 --> 05:05.024
The bald sweaty guy in
your marketing department?

05:05.092 --> 05:07.170
Yeah. So listen to this.
We were at a pre-meeting today

05:07.237 --> 05:08.301
- for the fall rollout.
- Hmm.

05:08.368 --> 05:10.140
And he took his shoes off
at the table.

05:10.217 --> 05:11.503
- Oh, what?
- Yeah.

05:11.571 --> 05:13.366
What? He-he just
took his shoes off?

05:13.443 --> 05:15.698
Took 'em right off, plopped 'em
on the conference table.

05:15.766 --> 05:16.928
I couldn't believe it.

05:17.001 --> 05:18.162
Babe, the amount of hair

05:18.230 --> 05:19.514
- on that man's toes.
- Hold on.

05:19.582 --> 05:21.584
He wasn't wearing socks?
He was. The hair was

05:21.661 --> 05:22.764
poking through
the black

05:22.849 --> 05:24.405
- ankle sock. It was disgusting.
- Oh.

05:24.473 --> 05:27.192
- It was like a porcupine in a bag.
- God.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.143
I sent you a picture
this morning.

05:30.541 --> 05:31.875
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

05:32.078 --> 05:33.208
Oh, I must have missed that.

05:33.276 --> 05:35.356
Oh, it's fine. I figured
you were busy or something.

05:35.424 --> 05:36.466
Yeah, no, you know, I was.

05:36.543 --> 05:38.301
I was busy... this morning.

05:38.378 --> 05:41.688
Yeah, I had a little bit
of a... crisis with the janitor.

05:41.836 --> 05:43.574
- Oh, no. What happened?
- It was real gross.

05:43.641 --> 05:47.469
He, uh... I-I caught him in the,
uh, supply closet masturbating.

05:47.537 --> 05:49.218
- What?
- Yeah, uh, alone.

05:49.289 --> 05:51.391
He was alone in there,
and I caught him.

05:51.524 --> 05:53.359
I caught him in there.

05:53.427 --> 05:54.609
That is so gross.

05:54.677 --> 05:56.242
- In this supply closet?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

05:56.310 --> 05:59.063
Who would want to do anything
sexual in a supply closet?

05:59.131 --> 06:00.405
What is wrong
with people?

06:00.474 --> 06:03.648
I know.
Yeah, I know, that is...

06:04.083 --> 06:06.570
People are disgusting.

06:06.698 --> 06:08.508
- You take it. No, you take it.
- I got it.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.594
I don't want it.
You take it.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.435
- Okay, can you stop playing air hockey...
- Why are you...?

06:12.503 --> 06:14.175
with the snotty tissue?

06:14.337 --> 06:16.186
- Knock it off!
- Okay!

06:16.272 --> 06:18.074
We have work to do.

06:18.151 --> 06:19.165
Geez.

06:20.846 --> 06:23.714
Tim, I looked at your deposition
in the Crawford case.

06:23.831 --> 06:25.721
One word: blurghh.

06:25.846 --> 06:27.350
Can we take another
crack at that?

06:27.427 --> 06:29.533
Come on, it's fine.
We can show Nathaniel.

06:29.626 --> 06:30.982
No, we can't. Jim,

06:31.050 --> 06:33.560
for your hearing next week,
I rewrote your opening arguments.

06:33.628 --> 06:35.732
I thought you might want
to win a case for a change.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.956
Well, you thought
wrong. Wait.

06:38.024 --> 06:40.226
Paula, did you read my
notes on the land use meeting?

06:40.294 --> 06:43.229
I made them really thorough.
Did you show them to Rebecca?

06:43.297 --> 06:46.963
No. I gave her War and Peace,
because it was shorter.

06:48.014 --> 06:49.516
What?

06:50.479 --> 06:51.736
Oh, okay.

06:51.822 --> 06:53.811
Sue me, I want our
work to, like...

06:53.879 --> 06:55.970
I don't know...
not suck.

06:56.686 --> 06:58.291
Okay, well, I have
some good news.

06:58.759 --> 07:00.450
I came up with
a brilliant idea.

07:00.518 --> 07:01.861
You can all
thank me later.

07:01.929 --> 07:03.921
I've decided to call
for reinforcements.

07:03.989 --> 07:05.048
You mean the reinforcements

07:05.115 --> 07:06.536
that go in
the three-hole punch paper?

07:06.603 --> 07:07.995
I've been trying to get
in the supply closet

07:08.062 --> 07:09.787
to get those,
but it's always locked,

07:09.855 --> 07:12.517
and the door is making
a banging noise.

07:12.713 --> 07:15.221
I think there's a possum
and a cat in there,

07:15.289 --> 07:16.298
and they're fighting,

07:16.366 --> 07:19.159
but they're also best friends
and they solve crimes.

07:19.268 --> 07:20.658
It's just an idea

07:20.747 --> 07:23.306
for a CBS show I've been
kicking around.

07:24.572 --> 07:27.433
Okay, that is Sunil.

07:27.728 --> 07:29.345
He is a competent person.

07:29.422 --> 07:32.064
Do not get your lame juice
on him.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.138
He is really smart.

07:34.270 --> 07:35.197
As opposed to...?

07:35.265 --> 07:36.333
Yeah, all of you.

07:36.663 --> 07:37.876
Hi!

07:37.953 --> 07:39.578
Oh. Hey!

07:39.655 --> 07:40.793
I'm here.

07:40.861 --> 07:45.121
Oh, great. Now the sidekick's
got a sidekick.

07:51.267 --> 07:53.169
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

07:54.668 --> 07:56.863
I was, I was looking for these.
What do you call these?

07:56.931 --> 07:59.464
Do you call these flags
or sticky page holders?

07:59.532 --> 08:02.335
Oh, no, those... I call those
"color thingies," actually.

08:02.403 --> 08:03.527
Color thingies.

08:03.595 --> 08:05.210
Yeah.
Oh, my God, that...

08:05.278 --> 08:08.204
that Stanford education, like,
gave you a great vocabulary.

08:08.308 --> 08:10.503
Well, it's why I'm so good
at games like Boggle.

08:10.597 --> 08:12.230
Oh, my God, I love Boggle.

08:12.298 --> 08:15.727
Well, you and I should, um,
play Boggle some time.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.836
- Yeah. Oh, my God, Boggle.
- Oh.

08:20.248 --> 08:21.452
Close the door.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.469
- I want to rip your pants off.
- Okay.

08:27.946 --> 08:29.211
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:29.279 --> 08:30.938
This should never
happen again after this.

08:31.006 --> 08:33.086
Absolutely.
This is the last time.

08:33.155 --> 08:34.335
Okay.
Absolutely.

08:34.453 --> 08:36.094
I love this bra,
by the way.

08:36.179 --> 08:37.491
Oh, thank you.

08:41.945 --> 08:43.195
Check this out.

08:43.263 --> 08:44.952
- Yellowtail crudo.
- Mmm.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.219
I'm thinking of rolling it out
at all my Home Bases.

08:47.336 --> 08:49.908
It's so tasty, and it pairs
really well with our chardonnay,

08:49.976 --> 08:52.935
which is, like, well, it's just,
like, the only one we have.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.857
Oh, wait.
Didn't the book say

08:54.925 --> 08:56.140
you're not supposed
to eat raw fish?

08:56.207 --> 08:57.365
Could be harmful
for the baby.

08:57.432 --> 09:00.348
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Totally. My bad.

09:00.503 --> 09:02.740
- Got to take care of that Darryl baby.
- Ooh.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.138
God, I love my new hobby...
growing people.

09:05.206 --> 09:06.987
Wait. Did you hear that?
Did you...?

09:07.056 --> 09:09.841
Boop, made an eyeball.
What'd you do today?

09:10.042 --> 09:11.754
God, I really can't believe it.

09:11.822 --> 09:14.310
I got my life together in
a really short amount of time.

09:14.401 --> 09:17.271
Like, making a human,
cute boyfriend,

09:17.387 --> 09:20.177
great new job,
and I'm, like, crushing it here.

09:20.373 --> 09:22.630
I mean, look at all these people
at my happy hour.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.427
So, Beth,
how did you find me?

09:24.495 --> 09:26.021
I like to know how new
clients hear about me.

09:26.088 --> 09:27.805
I actually came across
your website

09:27.873 --> 09:30.263
when I was looking online
for party planners in the area.

09:30.331 --> 09:31.331
I got to say,

09:31.404 --> 09:33.388
you actually look
like your photo.

09:33.456 --> 09:35.990
People never look
like their photo online.

09:36.058 --> 09:37.159
Oh, well, which one?

09:37.227 --> 09:39.357
Calendar, About Me, FAQs,

09:39.462 --> 09:41.615
Upcoming Events,
Past Events or Contact Me?

09:41.683 --> 09:43.146
God, you're funny.

09:43.490 --> 09:45.170
What! Me?!

09:45.238 --> 09:46.997
I am so glad that I met you.

09:47.065 --> 09:48.760
My PR firm has
a ton of events

09:48.828 --> 09:50.709
coming up
in the San Gabriel Valley.

09:50.786 --> 09:53.178
I live on the Westside, I don't
have any contacts around here,

09:53.245 --> 09:55.404
but... now I do.

09:55.825 --> 09:56.927
Yeah, you do.

09:57.053 --> 09:59.591
All you need to do is...
contact me.

10:00.803 --> 10:02.302
Contact you.
I'm gonna do that.

10:02.370 --> 10:03.835
- I'm gonna contact you.
- Great. Yeah.

10:03.902 --> 10:06.615
So you're getting a free
vacation to Mexico. That's cool.

10:06.738 --> 10:08.037
It's not really a vacation.

10:08.118 --> 10:10.187
Uh, you get to ride a plane
and go camping.

10:10.255 --> 10:11.589
That's a vacation, bro.

10:11.657 --> 10:14.692
I'm building houses
for Habitat for Humanity.

10:14.778 --> 10:17.825
- Oh, yeah, Happy Tats for Manatees.
- Hmm?

10:18.025 --> 10:19.835
Well, that's what
I used to think it was.

10:19.903 --> 10:22.962
A group that put tattoos on
manatees to, like, track them.

10:23.361 --> 10:24.319
It's not.

10:24.396 --> 10:26.177
I know that now.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.665
Do you?

10:28.903 --> 10:30.044
Anyway,

10:30.303 --> 10:32.997
feeling like I got to get out
of town for a little while.

10:33.355 --> 10:35.817
Feeling kind of
spun out lately.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.341
Little emotional.

10:38.559 --> 10:39.997
I think it's 'cause
everything in this town

10:40.064 --> 10:41.488
reminds me of Darryl.

10:41.791 --> 10:44.684
Wow, I've never seen you
like this.

10:44.864 --> 10:46.723
Hurt and vulnerable.

10:46.791 --> 10:48.883
I, like, really see
your humanity.

10:48.951 --> 10:51.329
Yeah, see, so that sounds
a lot like "manatee."

10:51.473 --> 10:52.782
So that's on them.

10:52.907 --> 10:55.511
A lot of words sound
like other words, Josh.

10:55.579 --> 10:57.407
Come on, come on,
give me the dish.

10:57.964 --> 10:59.922
- Okay. Tall idiot is Tim.
- Mm-hmm.

10:59.990 --> 11:03.079
Short idiot is Jim.
Tiny idiot is Maya.

11:03.147 --> 11:05.961
- They look like idiots.
- No, no, no.

11:06.029 --> 11:08.165
They look like a
Sunday matinee cast

11:08.290 --> 11:10.165
of an eighth year revival.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.331
Oh, Sunil.

11:14.455 --> 11:16.490
I never understand
your musical theater references

11:16.558 --> 11:19.711
because I was getting laid
and smoking dope in high school,

11:19.806 --> 11:22.188
but they still crack me up.

11:22.256 --> 11:24.477
Hey, thank you so
much for hiring me.

11:24.545 --> 11:25.602
Are you kidding me?

11:25.670 --> 11:27.360
No, you're-you're
doing me a favor.

11:27.428 --> 11:29.187
I am so glad you're here!

11:29.255 --> 11:31.403
It's gonna
be Sunil and Paula,

11:31.539 --> 11:33.063
you know, serving justice

11:33.131 --> 11:34.656
- around the world.
- Mm-hmm.

11:34.657 --> 11:36.114
We're doing the
work of idiots

11:36.191 --> 11:38.628
and wearing cool suits and
occasionally sunglasses.

11:38.705 --> 11:39.829
Coming soon

11:39.906 --> 11:40.955
to CBS.

11:41.023 --> 11:42.808
Oh, nailed it.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.097
Good.
We could be cops or lawyers.

11:45.165 --> 11:47.675
We could. Okay, listen...

11:47.829 --> 11:50.449
So, I was thinking
about the Crawford case

11:50.517 --> 11:52.398
that we... What?

11:52.609 --> 11:55.245
I'm just wondering if they have
a walk-in pantry here.

11:55.855 --> 11:57.410
- Nathaniel.
- Hmm?

11:57.478 --> 11:58.699
No.

11:58.767 --> 12:00.097
We talked about it, okay?

12:00.165 --> 12:02.316
Those other times were mistakes.
It's not happening again.

12:02.383 --> 12:03.530
Right.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.388
Okay. I was thinking

12:06.456 --> 12:08.012
that when we get to the hearing
that we should...

12:08.079 --> 12:09.955
- This a new top? This a new blouse?
- What?

12:10.023 --> 12:11.565
No, I've had it for a while.

12:11.633 --> 12:12.645
Looks good.

12:12.713 --> 12:15.385
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I like it.

12:16.581 --> 12:17.749
Right.

12:18.013 --> 12:19.638
Okay.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.674
They do have
a walk-in pantry, though.

12:23.871 --> 12:24.791
Really?

12:24.859 --> 12:26.244
Mm-hmm.
Why don't we pretend

12:26.312 --> 12:27.485
to work some more,

12:27.553 --> 12:30.346
meet there in five minutes,
take some clothes off?

12:31.463 --> 12:33.369
Okay. I'm gonna pretend to work.

12:33.507 --> 12:36.356
- Watch me pretend to work now. Okay.
- Uh-huh.

12:36.424 --> 12:37.899
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

12:38.213 --> 12:39.588
Oh, good underlining.

12:39.656 --> 12:41.024
Thank you.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.268
♪♪

12:44.768 --> 12:45.938
Hey, Heather.

12:46.006 --> 12:48.354
The CO2 tank is out.
Oh, I'll get it.

12:48.570 --> 12:49.948
I got it.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.435
Heather, what are you doing?
You shouldn't be carrying that.

13:02.502 --> 13:04.283
Leave me alone!

13:04.351 --> 13:06.205
You're the reason I'm like this!

13:06.273 --> 13:07.855
That is not my baby.

13:07.923 --> 13:09.057
That's not my ba...

13:09.125 --> 13:10.682
You could've stopped me.

13:12.310 --> 13:14.588
Oh. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.028
I-I'm sorry I said it like that.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.363
I don't know
why I said it like that.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.463
I hate being pregnant.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.557
It's the worst thing

13:19.625 --> 13:21.291
I've ever decided.
I'm gonna quit.

13:21.366 --> 13:22.665
I want to quit.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.150
I quit.

13:25.344 --> 13:27.049
Babe, come on.
You're almost there.

13:27.123 --> 13:29.282
No, I'm not.
I have another month.

13:29.633 --> 13:32.112
It's nine. It's nine months.

13:32.210 --> 13:33.658
Okay? It hurts to sit.

13:33.726 --> 13:35.207
It hurts to stand.

13:35.275 --> 13:37.198
My ass is covered
in stretch marks,

13:37.266 --> 13:38.305
- as you know.
- I know.

13:38.373 --> 13:39.441
My belly button looks like

13:39.509 --> 13:41.057
an inside-out butthole.

13:41.245 --> 13:42.446
No.
I still haven't tasted

13:42.514 --> 13:45.416
the crudo. I also, um...
I can't drink wine.

13:45.484 --> 13:48.077
I can't use my face wash.
I can't paint my nails.

13:48.145 --> 13:50.303
I can't take a hot bath
or get a foot massage

13:50.371 --> 13:52.802
or lie on my back
or fart without peeing a little.

13:52.870 --> 13:55.119
I can't do anything fun!

13:55.187 --> 13:56.178
We have fun.

13:56.246 --> 13:57.440
No, we don't.

13:57.658 --> 13:58.759
No? I want to do this.

13:59.078 --> 14:01.190
Yes. I want to do this.

14:01.487 --> 14:04.112
Sign me up for this
and buy me a skateboard.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.979
A skateboarding expo?

14:09.047 --> 14:11.518
Uh-huh. My doctor said
that I can't ride a bike

14:11.586 --> 14:13.299
or, uh, skydive or surf,

14:13.382 --> 14:15.356
but he said nothing
about learning to skateboard.

14:15.424 --> 14:18.893
So that's what we call
a loophole, brah.

14:19.283 --> 14:20.565
It's obvious

14:20.633 --> 14:21.901
his name should be Dog Josh.

14:21.969 --> 14:23.272
- He looks just like us.
- No.

14:23.342 --> 14:24.727
No, Josh.
We're not doing that.

14:24.795 --> 14:26.737
Been through it a million
times. His name is Max.

14:26.805 --> 14:28.329
Found him in a garbage dump
in Mexico.

14:28.397 --> 14:29.671
He's been through enough
without also having

14:29.738 --> 14:30.808
to be named after you.

14:30.876 --> 14:32.092
I know what
that's like.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.659
It's not great.

14:33.736 --> 14:34.623
Geez, don't be such a baby.

14:34.691 --> 14:36.383
Look at you, little Dog Josh.

14:36.451 --> 14:38.132
Aren't you Dog Josh?

14:38.200 --> 14:39.321
Yes, you are.

14:39.389 --> 14:41.334
- Yes, you are.
- Look how much he hates that.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.780
Let it go.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.280
You know what, Heather did do a
great job with this renovation.

14:47.348 --> 14:49.070
- I'm digging the Home Base makeover.
- Yeah.

14:49.137 --> 14:50.505
She tried a few styles
before this.

14:50.573 --> 14:52.850
Apparently pregnant women
redecorate a lot.

14:52.918 --> 14:53.918
Hmm.
Yeah.

14:54.256 --> 14:56.726
A lot of stuff changed
while you were out of town.

14:57.118 --> 14:58.915
I'm very good at it now.

14:58.983 --> 15:01.097
It was ridiculous.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.120
Oh, my God.
That's so funny.

15:07.269 --> 15:08.894
Bleh!

15:09.635 --> 15:11.259
It was gross!

15:13.497 --> 15:14.855
Like, oh, no.

15:14.964 --> 15:16.954
But a lot of stuff's
still the same.

15:17.089 --> 15:18.845
Okay, that was the last time.

15:18.912 --> 15:20.245
Definitely.

15:20.349 --> 15:22.080
- This time we mean it, right?
- Yes.

15:24.276 --> 15:26.826
Uh, this is Mona. I have to take it.

15:28.005 --> 15:29.297
Hey, babe.

15:29.365 --> 15:30.399
So, it's been eight months,

15:30.466 --> 15:31.602
and he still has a girlfriend

15:31.669 --> 15:33.185
and we're still sleeping together.

15:33.293 --> 15:34.509
So what?

15:34.793 --> 15:37.748
I really thought this time
was gonna be different.

15:41.981 --> 15:47.495
So, it's been eight months of

15:47.754 --> 15:50.066
"last times," "big mistakes,"

15:50.134 --> 15:52.149
and "never gonna happen agains."

15:52.217 --> 15:53.904
So that's what you do
when you're writing.

15:53.972 --> 15:55.185
You just write things I say
and

15:55.271 --> 15:57.016
then quote them back
to me at a later date.

15:57.093 --> 15:58.700
Cool. I can do that, too.

15:58.777 --> 16:00.702
"Uh, so it's been eight months.

16:00.779 --> 16:02.826
"Uh, and I'm gonna quote a
bunch of things that you said

16:02.893 --> 16:05.662
back to you and wear another
weird statement necklace."

16:07.344 --> 16:08.874
I'm sorry.

16:09.129 --> 16:11.598
I felt cornered and threatened by you,

16:11.666 --> 16:13.840
and rather than be
vulnerable, I lashed out

16:13.908 --> 16:15.779
before you could abandon me,
and I recognize that,

16:15.846 --> 16:16.872
and I apologize for it.

16:16.940 --> 16:18.504
But your necklaces are very weird.

16:18.614 --> 16:20.130
It's been months

16:20.387 --> 16:22.054
and you're still sleeping with him

16:22.294 --> 16:24.504
and he's got a serious
girlfriend. Correct?

16:24.572 --> 16:27.237
- Yes.
- We're doing great work here.

16:27.337 --> 16:28.772
Why have an affair?

16:28.840 --> 16:30.183
An affair?

16:30.946 --> 16:32.606
Well, that's unfair.

16:34.262 --> 16:35.692
Come on.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.643
Are we not doing this?

16:37.762 --> 16:40.270
Bunch and Akopes,
tonight on CBS.

16:40.371 --> 16:43.685
Grab your parka or bikini,
and let's find out whodunit.

16:43.957 --> 16:46.351
You've been trying to get that
bit going for eight months.

16:46.419 --> 16:48.327
- Stop it.
- But I have a theme song.

16:48.468 --> 16:50.067
♪ Nuh, duh, duh, duh, two ladies ♪

16:50.135 --> 16:51.576
♪ Duh, duh, duh, duh, solving crimes ♪

16:51.643 --> 16:53.075
♪ Duh, duh, duh, duh, in Bahamas ♪

16:53.143 --> 16:54.843
♪ Duh, duh, duh, duh,
now it's Europe! ♪

16:54.957 --> 16:56.549
But it's all just Atlanta.

16:56.673 --> 16:58.656
You have no qualms about this?

16:58.937 --> 17:01.692
No concern for the third
party in that relationship?

17:01.760 --> 17:03.644
What, the janitor? No, he's loving it.

17:04.380 --> 17:06.460
If you're talking about Mona...

17:07.076 --> 17:08.584
Look, she has no idea
what's going on,

17:08.651 --> 17:09.742
so it's not hurting her.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.417
And I've never even
met her. You know what?

17:12.486 --> 17:14.037
This is the healthiest
romantic relationship

17:14.104 --> 17:16.034
I've ever been in. There, I said it.

17:16.444 --> 17:19.692
I-I'm not obsessed with him
because I can't really have him.

17:20.131 --> 17:22.028
For the first time in
my life, my expectations

17:22.096 --> 17:23.468
are in a realistic space.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.184
The other day I texted him,

17:25.252 --> 17:27.458
and he didn't text me
back for couple hours.

17:27.612 --> 17:28.981
You know what I did in that time?

17:29.127 --> 17:31.878
I made a damn sandwich.
And it was good.

17:32.339 --> 17:33.567
It's all okay, okay?

17:33.635 --> 17:35.840
What we're doing is okay. Okay?

17:35.950 --> 17:38.279
That cheating, lying,

17:38.372 --> 17:41.465
musical theater enthusiast.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.239
What? Who are you
talking about?

17:43.313 --> 17:45.121
What?
I'm talking about Sunil.

17:45.245 --> 17:47.254
Oh. Ew. Why?

17:47.438 --> 17:48.939
Okay, have you looked around this office

17:49.006 --> 17:51.063
and seen him being pals
with everyone?

17:51.131 --> 17:52.317
I mean, I brought him in,

17:52.385 --> 17:54.519
I gave him the job, and
he barely talks to me.

17:54.587 --> 17:56.895
Wait, back it up.
Sunil works here?

17:56.996 --> 17:59.340
Uh, yes.

17:59.533 --> 18:01.249
Where have you been?

18:01.317 --> 18:03.032
Nothing. Nowhere.
The janitor's creepy.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.364
Okay, will you listen to me?

18:04.432 --> 18:07.408
I gave Sunil a job,
and he was supposed to help me

18:07.476 --> 18:08.997
and be on my team.

18:09.065 --> 18:11.958
And instead, he-he
joined their idiot cult.

18:12.026 --> 18:13.849
- Ow! Damn it. Damn it.
- Got you.

18:14.204 --> 18:15.587
Fast hands. Ah!

18:15.664 --> 18:17.895
I'm sorry, Paula. You guys
were such good friends.

18:17.970 --> 18:19.628
I mean, I don't like him or get him

18:19.698 --> 18:21.309
because he's like...

18:21.386 --> 18:23.420
he's like Benjamin Coffin III
in Rent.

18:23.497 --> 18:24.804
But, you know, I mean,

18:25.129 --> 18:26.379
you seem to dig him, so...

18:26.447 --> 18:29.950
Well, I mean, I did,
but... now he's my enemy.

18:31.004 --> 18:34.090
Like Boss Hogg in The Dukes of Hazzard.

18:34.381 --> 18:37.851
I keep forgetting, you and I have,
like, such different references.

18:39.103 --> 18:42.993
Ms. Proctor, I just redid
this, per your copious notes.

18:43.061 --> 18:44.352
I'm sorry.

18:45.123 --> 18:47.779
I mean, look, you had to redo it.

18:48.058 --> 18:51.126
Citing Manuel v. Cahill to
argue a zoning restriction?

18:51.194 --> 18:53.063
I mean, this is a professional law firm.

18:53.131 --> 18:55.307
It's not eighth grade mock trial.

18:55.461 --> 18:58.637
Wow. Okay.

18:59.273 --> 19:00.689
All right.

19:04.536 --> 19:05.627
Oh, my God.

19:05.695 --> 19:07.453
You were so mean to him.

19:07.883 --> 19:09.230
Oh, you just talked to him

19:09.298 --> 19:11.516
just like you talk to
Tim and Jim and Maya.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.451
That wasn't mean.
I was not mean.

19:13.742 --> 19:15.387
I gave him my honest opinion.

19:15.519 --> 19:17.557
I mean, I have to be
honest about the work.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.821
Okay. I-I don't care.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.373
I mean, again, I feel like
he's like an evil landlord

19:22.441 --> 19:23.673
making us pay our rent.

19:23.741 --> 19:24.746
What?

19:24.814 --> 19:27.227
Okay, you know what, just
Wikipedia the plot to Rent

19:27.368 --> 19:28.928
and get back to me...
It's really easy.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.744
But don't watch the movie!
Don't watch the movie.

19:30.811 --> 19:31.811
Okay.

19:35.385 --> 19:36.751
Hi.

19:37.073 --> 19:38.989
- Hey.
- How's your day going?

19:39.315 --> 19:40.759
- Pretty good.
- You?

19:40.882 --> 19:43.579
Big mistake.
Never again.

19:43.647 --> 19:45.564
This is the last time.

19:45.722 --> 19:47.697
Yeah, or not.

19:48.089 --> 19:49.063
What?

19:49.131 --> 19:51.047
I was talking about
this in therapy today,

19:51.084 --> 19:54.260
and, I got to say, this
arrangement is...

19:54.433 --> 19:55.666
it's working.

19:55.751 --> 19:58.063
And, you know,
it's modern, it's mature.

19:58.337 --> 20:01.188
I mean, it's what they
do in France. And Utah.

20:01.256 --> 20:03.657
Literally the only thing
France and Utah have in common.

20:03.725 --> 20:05.555
I think we should just
be grown-ups about this

20:05.623 --> 20:07.657
and accept the fact
that this is our reality.

20:07.827 --> 20:09.891
You know? It's cool.
We're having sex.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.208
You're seeing someone else.

20:11.276 --> 20:13.391
I'm making sandwiches,
and they're great.

20:13.524 --> 20:15.040
- Huh?
- It's a whole thing.

20:15.108 --> 20:18.509
I think we should just
embrace that this is our life.

20:18.641 --> 20:22.391
Okay. Because, um, well,
I was gonna ask you, uh...

20:22.514 --> 20:24.290
Mona saw the invitation

20:24.405 --> 20:26.470
to Darryl's baby shower,
and she wants to go.

20:26.538 --> 20:30.056
And I know that you're
gonna go, and... you know...

20:30.163 --> 20:31.920
Is that cool if I bring her?

20:32.210 --> 20:33.743
Dude, of course.

20:33.851 --> 20:35.274
- Yeah.
- We're all adults.

20:35.342 --> 20:37.876
And I-I am looking
forward to meeting her.

20:39.064 --> 20:40.516
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

20:40.750 --> 20:43.688
Oh. Okay. Great.

20:43.921 --> 20:46.824
This adult is... happy to hear it.

20:46.895 --> 20:48.437
See, we know exactly
what we have.

20:48.505 --> 20:49.601
That's what I love about it.

20:49.668 --> 20:51.504
- Love about me?
- Definitely not.

20:51.715 --> 20:53.360
- Got it. Yep.
- Yeah.

20:53.428 --> 20:54.657
Cool.

21:01.538 --> 21:03.037
Hello.

21:03.795 --> 21:06.668
I think you're gonna be pretty
excited about what I got you.

21:06.737 --> 21:09.975
I got you some lotion.

21:10.043 --> 21:11.913
- Hmm?
- Cool.

21:12.173 --> 21:16.160
And some really nice decaf
coffee blends. Mmm.

21:16.323 --> 21:17.323
Mm-hmm.

21:17.475 --> 21:20.168
And non-alcoholic beer.

21:20.236 --> 21:21.900
That's gonna hit the spot.

21:22.013 --> 21:25.613
Yeah. So what's so crazy
about all of these things

21:25.681 --> 21:28.199
is that none it is a skateboard,

21:28.267 --> 21:30.153
which is what I asked you for.

21:30.438 --> 21:32.254
Because you're super pregnant.

21:32.323 --> 21:34.067
Okay? You-you have
a person inside you,

21:34.135 --> 21:36.644
and if you fall over,
you could break that person.

21:36.757 --> 21:38.383
Look, I know it's hard,

21:38.514 --> 21:40.140
but you signed up for this.

21:40.281 --> 21:42.765
This could not possibly
have been more optional.

21:42.849 --> 21:44.724
You said you wanted to have
a baby for your friends.

21:44.791 --> 21:47.234
And for once in your
life, you can't quit.

21:50.082 --> 21:51.340
Oh, my God.

21:51.408 --> 21:52.666
What's going on?

21:53.214 --> 21:54.926
Is something wrong with your face?

21:57.747 --> 21:59.333
Oh, my God, I've never seen you cry.

21:59.472 --> 22:02.488
That's because I don't cry.

22:03.012 --> 22:05.722
When I was a baby, I didn't cry at all.

22:05.805 --> 22:07.801
And they took me to the hospital

22:07.906 --> 22:09.790
because they thought I was broken,

22:10.038 --> 22:12.830
but I was just a super chill baby.

22:12.993 --> 22:16.895
And now I feel like I'm
gonna cry all the time,

22:16.963 --> 22:20.653
and I think it's because
there's this alien

22:20.782 --> 22:22.895
growing inside of my guts.

22:23.442 --> 22:24.593
Oh, honey, it's okay.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.535
No, get your super
smooth arms off of me.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.481
Yeah, they're too smooth.

22:29.535 --> 22:32.458
So, would now be a bad time

22:32.526 --> 22:35.558
to remind you that Darryl's
baby shower is about to happen?

22:35.659 --> 22:38.371
Oh, God. That thing.

22:38.439 --> 22:40.551
Oh, shoot, we forgot
to get him a present.

22:41.042 --> 22:45.079
I am making him a present, bitch!

22:52.558 --> 22:55.723
V, it is beautiful. I love it.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.535
Aw. I couldn't have done
it without you

22:57.603 --> 22:59.303
covering all the boring side
of things.

22:59.474 --> 23:01.379
I'm so glad we're
in business together.

23:01.499 --> 23:04.082
You're so good at charts
and budgets

23:04.150 --> 23:05.668
and getting deals on stuff.

23:05.736 --> 23:08.332
I can't believe you got those
floating candles 75% off.

23:08.473 --> 23:10.106
That's so sexy.

23:11.626 --> 23:13.278
There you are!

23:13.346 --> 23:15.856
Oh, my God!

23:15.993 --> 23:18.348
- It is so beautiful!
- Ooh! Oh.

23:18.473 --> 23:20.426
Yay! Oh, I'm so happy!

23:20.494 --> 23:21.692
Okay, well, try not to cry,

23:21.760 --> 23:23.443
because it makes people
uncomfortable, mainly me.

23:23.510 --> 23:24.924
I'll try, I'll try.

23:25.230 --> 23:26.770
Oh, God!

23:26.838 --> 23:28.838
Onesies that people can decorate?

23:29.009 --> 23:31.965
Muh-muh. Tears, you stay in there.

23:32.033 --> 23:34.010
If I just walk like this...

23:35.472 --> 23:36.770
No one talk to me.

23:37.001 --> 23:40.145
Also, I'm not opening a damn thing.

23:42.166 --> 23:44.415
- What's with her?
- She's a monster.

23:51.879 --> 23:53.504
Oh, my God, it's Sunil.

23:54.042 --> 23:55.510
I don't know, I've been
thinking about what you said,

23:55.577 --> 23:57.251
and-and maybe I was too hard on him.

23:57.319 --> 23:58.392
I should apologize.

23:58.460 --> 24:00.790
- I'm gonna apologize.
- I mean, sure, if you want to.

24:01.550 --> 24:03.119
You know what, do it in his terms.

24:03.187 --> 24:05.095
Tell him that he's Herbie

24:05.163 --> 24:06.617
and you're Mama Rose from Gypsy

24:06.685 --> 24:08.733
and you're about to sing
"You'll Never Get Away from Me."

24:08.800 --> 24:10.985
You and Sunil really are the
ones that should be friends.

24:11.052 --> 24:12.416
I mean, you-you know that, right?

24:12.484 --> 24:14.509
- Never. I'd rather die.
- Oh, okay.

24:15.924 --> 24:17.349
I'm gonna get a drink.

24:17.417 --> 24:19.137
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, no, I'm good.

24:41.304 --> 24:44.387
Uh, guilt, shame, jealousy.

24:44.667 --> 24:46.136
No, I don't want this.

25:03.012 --> 25:04.871
You know, nothing is
good enough for her.

25:04.987 --> 25:06.519
She's like Miss Hannigan,

25:06.669 --> 25:09.253
but not the Carol Burnett
version, the original company.

Never.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.320
I totally agree with you about Paula.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.367
She once shredded a brief I wrote,

25:20.438 --> 25:22.689
then took it out of the shredder
and put it in the other way.

25:22.756 --> 25:23.852
Paula is from

- an older generation of women.
- Mm hm.

25:25.873 --> 25:28.234
She came up in an era
where she had to fight,

25:28.344 --> 25:32.063
and that's why now, sometimes,
she's such a big ol' "B."

25:32.131 --> 25:33.711
Yeah, I know.

25:34.002 --> 25:36.385
I used to really love her.

Cheers.

- Hey, I got to get out of here.
- I got to get out of here, too.

25:53.545 --> 25:54.861
No, no, you can't leave.
You're Auntie Paula.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.392
- You're Mama Rebecca.
- I'm not Mama Rebecca.

25:56.459 --> 25:58.596
I don't have any custody rights,
just the right to pick the college.

25:58.663 --> 26:01.108
Okay, okay, so we both
need to find an excuse

26:01.176 --> 26:02.549
- to get out of here.
- What are we gonna do?

26:02.616 --> 26:04.939
- I don't know.
- Huh?

26:05.409 --> 26:07.151
Oh, no, there's a bee on your dress.

26:07.219 --> 26:09.386
What?

26:09.737 --> 26:11.722
Whoops. I tried to save
you from a stinging insect,

26:11.789 --> 26:13.248
but accidentally used my cupcake hand.

26:13.315 --> 26:15.490
Oh, oh, the same insect is on you.

26:15.567 --> 26:17.543
Oh, no. Ooh... ah, my God.

26:17.620 --> 26:19.561
Sensitive boobs. You know that.

26:19.629 --> 26:22.607
Oh... aw, shucks. Guess
we got to go clean up now.

26:22.750 --> 26:23.916
We're so sorry. We got to go.

26:23.993 --> 26:25.342
Back way, back way, back way.

26:25.419 --> 26:26.650
- You're gonna love these cupcakes.
- We got to go clean up.

26:26.717 --> 26:27.815
- Delicious.
- We got to get it off.

26:27.882 --> 26:29.572
- It's all over. So good.
- Come on.

26:29.640 --> 26:32.228
So, am I really the office bitch?

26:37.005 --> 26:39.206
Wait, you're actually asking me that?

26:39.423 --> 26:41.267
Paula, it's your brand.

26:41.558 --> 26:43.697
You have the mug that
says "Office Bitch."

26:43.765 --> 26:45.158
It's ironic.

26:45.408 --> 26:48.199
Like the mug that says "Not A Mug."

26:48.267 --> 26:49.291
I guess so.

26:49.359 --> 26:51.042
I mean, you're nice to
me, so I don't really care.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.749
Hey, I know why I had
to leave that party,

26:52.885 --> 26:53.955
but why did you have to?

26:54.023 --> 26:55.747
It was just hard to see Nathaniel.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.096
I mean, you know,

26:57.164 --> 26:59.791
my desk faces his, so
I'm just kind of, like,

26:59.912 --> 27:01.286
tired of that face

27:01.363 --> 27:03.166
and those perfect blue eyes

27:03.234 --> 27:05.971
and the perfect smile and the hot ass.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.361
Uh-oh.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.712
- Paula?
- Uh-huh?

27:11.923 --> 27:15.103
- You gonna be mad at me.
- Uh-huh.

27:15.682 --> 27:18.196
You know the possum and the cat

27:18.360 --> 27:20.775
who have been fighting
in the supply closet?

27:21.076 --> 27:22.115
Uh-huh.

27:22.278 --> 27:24.338
That's not a possum or a cat.

27:24.463 --> 27:26.666
That's two people having sex.

27:26.734 --> 27:28.588
- And it's me and Nathaniel!
- Rebecca,

27:28.656 --> 27:30.330
he has a serious girlfriend!

27:30.398 --> 27:31.775
He-he's cheating on her with you?

27:31.843 --> 27:32.822
You're having an affair?

27:32.890 --> 27:34.830
No, it's not an affair;
she doesn't know anything about it.

27:34.898 --> 27:37.181
- What?!
- Ah! Don't judge me right now.

27:37.249 --> 27:39.076
Oh, to hell with that.
I am judging you.

27:39.162 --> 27:41.510
- I am judging you so hard right now!
- No, please don't.

27:41.688 --> 27:43.686
Do you know what you are?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.744
You're a Tanya.

27:46.051 --> 27:47.908
- You're a stone-cold Tanya.
- No.

27:47.976 --> 27:49.534
You take that back.
I am nothing like

27:49.602 --> 27:51.267
that woman Scott cheated on you with.

27:51.525 --> 27:52.839
Nathaniel and Mona aren't married,

27:52.906 --> 27:55.081
they don't have kids, and
I don't own an orange vest,

27:55.149 --> 27:56.823
which is the only fact
that I retain about Tanya.

27:56.890 --> 27:59.510
I just, I can't, I can't
believe you're a cheater.

27:59.854 --> 28:01.128
I mean, you know how much it hurt me

28:01.195 --> 28:02.627
when I was cheated on.

28:02.784 --> 28:05.400
Oh, my God, I know.
You're right, you're right.

28:05.754 --> 28:08.042
You're right. I mean, it's why
I've been avoiding telling you.

28:08.109 --> 28:09.306
But I don't understand.

28:09.374 --> 28:11.437
Because you dumped him,
he still seems like

28:11.505 --> 28:12.524
he wants to be with you.

28:12.592 --> 28:15.062
Like, wh-why wouldn't
you just date each other?

28:15.130 --> 28:16.527
Just go out with him.

28:29.696 --> 28:31.800
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:32.221 --> 28:34.291
I guess you didn't make
it to the baby shower.

28:34.359 --> 28:36.064
You missed the blessing
of the egg donor.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.611
We all whispered intentions
into hard-boiled eggs.

28:38.679 --> 28:42.000
Yeah, I got some cupcake on
my shirt, so I-I had to leave.

28:44.423 --> 28:47.564
Oh, um, you know, I'm
actually running low on pens.

28:47.632 --> 28:49.541
Are you running low on sticky thingies?

28:49.825 --> 28:51.575
You want to hit the supply closet?

28:52.588 --> 28:54.028
Um...

28:55.624 --> 28:57.584

29:04.529 --> 29:08.610
Yeah, um... listen.

29:08.718 --> 29:12.314
I think I'm... good

29:12.382 --> 29:15.049
on office supplies...

29:15.852 --> 29:17.165
forever.

29:17.273 --> 29:19.650
Why no more office supplies?

29:19.989 --> 29:23.104
So, I know that I said that...

29:24.533 --> 29:26.326
I could get...

29:26.789 --> 29:30.156
pencils and pens with
you indefinitely...

29:32.359 --> 29:33.791
but I can't.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.158
Why? Y-You said getting...

29:37.321 --> 29:39.955
Scotch Tape and Wite-Out

29:40.359 --> 29:42.539
doesn't hurt anybody...
That's what you said.

29:42.607 --> 29:45.494
Yeah, but I was wrong.
I was wrong, it does.

29:45.666 --> 29:46.954
What are they talking about?

29:47.235 --> 29:48.493
It's pretty obvious, dude.

29:48.570 --> 29:49.564
Somebody got hurt with a pen.

29:49.632 --> 29:50.963
The fact is

29:51.031 --> 29:53.619
you're getting office
supplies from someone else.

29:54.909 --> 29:57.910
And I knew that, but I didn't, like...

29:58.537 --> 30:00.004

30:05.545 --> 30:07.981

30:12.017 --> 30:13.599
it-it has to end.

30:13.785 --> 30:15.065
Oh.

30:15.496 --> 30:18.300
So... what I'm saying is

30:18.589 --> 30:23.497

30:28.745 --> 30:32.551
Well... okay.

30:35.313 --> 30:36.546
I guess we were

30:36.614 --> 30:41.584
just kidding ourselves when
we thought we could get erasers

30:42.080 --> 30:44.556

Babe, why are you so upset
about a skateboard thing?

39:08.856 --> 39:11.250
Oh, it's not about a skateboard.

39:11.318 --> 39:13.010
It's about
my whole life.

39:13.078 --> 39:16.047
It's about having to be
responsible for things.

39:16.686 --> 39:20.289
I mean, I have a job
and a live-in boyfriend

39:20.382 --> 39:22.774
and a baby in my stomach.

39:23.024 --> 39:25.469
That's all grown-up stuff.

39:26.010 --> 39:29.008
I mean, I never thought
I would actually be a grown-up.

39:29.076 --> 39:30.188
Yeah.

39:30.256 --> 39:32.192
You know, I'm gonna
pay taxes this year.

39:32.260 --> 39:33.550
Isn't that ridiculous?

39:33.786 --> 39:36.869
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I get it.

39:37.039 --> 39:38.781
I don't know
how insurance works.

39:38.858 --> 39:40.206
Me, neither.

39:40.641 --> 39:42.336
We can figure
those things out.

39:43.289 --> 39:44.576
Me and you.

39:44.771 --> 39:45.993
Yeah.
