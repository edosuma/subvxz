00:02.335 --> 00:03.569
- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.570 --> 00:05.437
I'm not pregnant--totally
thought I was, but I'm not.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.539
- Why didn't you tell me
you thought you were pregnant?

00:07.541 --> 00:08.907
- I'm not.
- I can respect that

00:08.909 --> 00:10.342
You didn't want
to talk about it before,

00:10.344 --> 00:12.811
So can you please respect that I
don't want to talk about it now?

00:12.813 --> 00:15.447
Good night, jenna.

00:18.018 --> 00:18.951
[school bell rings]

00:18.953 --> 00:20.519
- It had been a week
since matty found out

00:20.521 --> 00:21.787
About the pregnancy scare,

00:21.789 --> 00:24.156
And he seemed to be doing
everything in his power

00:24.158 --> 00:27.292
To ensure
we didn't have another.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.562
Is everything okay?

00:30.564 --> 00:31.430
- Sure, babe.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.532
- He kept insisting
everything was fine,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.534
But his actions
said otherwise.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.435
It was weird.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.070
We weren't talking,
we weren't doing it,

00:38.072 --> 00:39.905
And what was worse,
we weren't talking

00:39.907 --> 00:40.873
About not doing it.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.375
Our communication was
at an all-time low.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.810
- Hold it right there.

00:44.812 --> 00:48.414
In light of the tragic
and untimely demise

00:48.416 --> 00:49.281
Of ricky schwartz,

00:49.283 --> 00:50.983
I am taking
precautionary measures

00:50.985 --> 00:53.819
To make our school
a peanut-free zone.

00:53.821 --> 00:58.624
Or rather, a pea-not zone.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.260
Are you in possession
of any nuts

01:01.262 --> 01:04.629
Or nut-related products?

01:04.632 --> 01:08.834
I'll be confiscating this.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.541
Nut check.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.646
All clear.

01:21.147 --> 01:24.216
I'm gonna have to stop you
right there, j.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.219
When was the last time
you had a nut in your mouth?

01:27.221 --> 01:30.289
- It was a good question.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.893
Okay, I'm not saying
I'm at an 11

01:34.895 --> 01:37.162
On the panic meter,
but I am inching towards a 7.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.431
Something is definitely off
in my relationship.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.133
- I'd say
it's pretty clearblue easy.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.135
Matty's freaked out
over the pregnancy scare.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.403
- How did you know
about that?

01:44.405 --> 01:45.804
- Jake and I
tell each other everything.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.806
- That's unhealthy.
And creepy.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.208
Next thing you know,
you'll be one

01:49.210 --> 01:50.642
Of those couples
who shares an email.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.345
- But even more shocking
than the potential mama drama

01:53.347 --> 01:54.780
Is that it came
from jake's mouth.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.714
- I'm sorry.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.748
I was gonna tell you.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.117
I tried to call--
- it's chills.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.085
I'm already over it.
- I get it, j.

02:00.087 --> 02:03.155
There are certain things
we should keep to ourselves.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.591
- What things?
- Just things.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.758
- Back to the hot topic
at hand,

02:06.760 --> 02:08.526
I know you and matty
are all action, no talk,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.562
But have you asked him
if everything's cool?

02:10.564 --> 02:12.564
- Of course I did.
- What did he say?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.133
- "sure, babe."
[both gasp]

02:14.135 --> 02:15.567
- He "sure-babed" you?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.768
"sure, babe"
is one step away

02:16.770 --> 02:18.470
From "whatever, honey,"
which is the gateway phrase

02:18.472 --> 02:21.073
To "take care,"
which we all know is the end.

02:21.075 --> 02:24.109
- Okay, now I'm at an 11.

02:26.779 --> 02:29.581
- If you dipsters seriously
think I killed ricky,

02:29.583 --> 02:33.085
Your iqs must be
as small as your--

02:33.087 --> 02:34.920
[bleep] it.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.055
I'm perfectly fine
eating alone.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.758
Go have lunch with hamil-tramp.
- I don't feel like it.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.460
I'd rather hang with you.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.662
Why aren't you eating?

02:43.664 --> 02:46.331
- I guess my murder rap
made me lose my appetite.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.667
Ever since ricky bit it,
everyone's afraid of me.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.570
Even that airbag, lissa,
is keeping her distance.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.838
- You poor thing.
- I know.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.240
I haven't outed anybody,
made anyone transfer,

02:55.242 --> 02:57.142
Or said the word harelip

02:57.144 --> 02:58.810
In three days.
- Come on, sades.

02:58.812 --> 02:59.945
This is all gonna blow over.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.446
No one really thinks
you're a murderer.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.415
- Miss saxton,
this is p.I. Mulville,

03:03.417 --> 03:05.184
Stands for
personal investigator.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.151
- Private investigator.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.619
- We're gonna have
to take you downtown

03:07.621 --> 03:08.820
To answer some questions.

03:08.822 --> 03:13.058
And by downtown,
I mean my office.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.226
- You better eat
your granola bar

03:14.228 --> 03:15.761
Before it's confiscated
by the nut patrol.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.730
- While I had no idea what
was going on in matty's head,

03:18.732 --> 03:22.067
Jake knew what tamara
packed for lunch.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.472
- Henry.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.045
- Am I having a seizure,

03:33.047 --> 03:34.646
Or did some weird stuff
just go down?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.915
- You guys,
this is my boyfriend henry.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.585
We're in love.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.386
- If every couple had
a different way of interfacing,

03:41.388 --> 03:45.257
Matty and I were somewhere
in the middle of the spectrum.

03:45.259 --> 03:48.160
Maybe the way to get us
back on track

03:48.162 --> 03:49.661
Was to go back to basics--

03:49.663 --> 03:52.364
Sex in a forbidden place,

03:52.366 --> 03:53.966
Where one of us was likely
to come out

03:53.968 --> 03:56.535
The other end needing
a tetanus shot.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.636
But it was worth the risk

03:57.638 --> 03:59.871
Because the make out
had stopped the freak out.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.140
With matty and me,
getting some action

04:02.142 --> 04:04.009
Always spoke louder
than words.

04:04.011 --> 04:08.880
- â™ª oh, I

04:08.882 --> 04:12.551
- I've got to get to class,
but this was fun.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.453
- That's it?
- We can hang out tonight.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.688
- I had no reason
to be insecurious.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.957
We were longer sophomores
at sex.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.791
We were juniors.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.728
And as such, we were going
to take our time.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.762
Yeah, let's hang out.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.064
- Cool.
Then we can talk.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.167
- It was time to stop worrying
and start freaking.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.738
Matty wanted to talk.

04:35.041 --> 04:35.807
- Whoo!

04:35.809 --> 04:36.875
Was that good for you?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.744
Yeah, that was good
for me too.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.513
Aw, damn.
My shirt's on backwards.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.950
[laughs]
thanks for the tune-up.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.185
- Heard someone got lucky
in the sanctuary.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.220
- Word sure travels fast.

04:48.222 --> 04:51.556
- So are you and henry in love?
- We're soul mates.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.591
- Where did you two meet?

04:52.593 --> 04:54.026
- In line waiting
for the new iphone.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.560
- What's henry's middle name?
- Bao-zhi.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.695
It means "full of wisdom."

04:56.697 --> 04:58.096
- Boxers or briefs?
- Beckhams.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.765
- I didn't think henry
was your type.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.833
I thought you liked
tall, skinny, asian boys

05:01.835 --> 05:03.435
With a sense of humor
and a cowlick

05:03.437 --> 05:04.569
An inch
above their right ear.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.071
- You mean like fred wu?
- Fred who?

05:06.073 --> 05:08.974
- Fred wu.
I know you know I know him.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.342
- Oh, right.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.610
I know everything about you

05:11.612 --> 05:12.844
Because your life
is so fascinating.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.780
I can't help but follow
every little thing

05:14.782 --> 05:17.015
That's happening in it.
- Hmm.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.684
- I'm kidding.

05:18.686 --> 05:22.020
[laughter]

05:28.628 --> 05:31.229
How long did
henry wear braces?

05:31.231 --> 05:34.099
- Trick question.
He never wore them.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.903
[both speaking mandarin]

05:37.905 --> 05:41.773
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.643
- [speaks mandarin]

05:47.013 --> 05:49.748
- Where were you the night
ricky schwartz died?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.884
- Hell if I know.
Home, I guess.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.021
- Is there anyone
who can corroborate your alibi?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.123
- We're not convinced
there was any foul play.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.292
We are just trying
to get some clarity.

06:00.294 --> 06:03.428
There was evidence of, uh,

06:03.430 --> 06:05.564
Sexual nature at the scene.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.665
- Ricky was a man whore,

06:06.667 --> 06:10.635
Which means there are probably,
like, 300 suspects.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.070
- If we called your folks,

06:12.072 --> 06:13.705
Would they confirm
you were home that night?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.707
- Don't call my parents.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.976
Call my lawyer.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.979
- You got a problem with us
calling your parents?

06:20.981 --> 06:23.348
- No, but I have
a problem with you.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.249
I'm curious.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.184
Do you and your sister wives
rotate clothing,

06:26.186 --> 06:28.920
Or is that your own
personal peasant skirt?

06:28.922 --> 06:31.556
- Deflecting--
an obvious sign of guilt.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.393
- I can put an end
to this bitch hunt right now.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.162
Can we have some privacy?
- You mind waiting outside?

06:37.164 --> 06:40.866
- Not from him,
from you.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.139
I didn't sleep
with that [bleep],

06:47.141 --> 06:48.240
And a test will prove it.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.942
- Sweetie, we don't have money
for fancy lie detectors.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.178
- No, genius.
A pap smear.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.513
I'm a virgin.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.615
But be warned.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.651
If you actually force me
to do that,

06:59.653 --> 07:00.819
I will sue you,

07:00.821 --> 07:03.688
And then you two
can bad-cop, worse-cop

07:03.690 --> 07:05.557
On the unemployment line.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.225
You're welcome.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.226
- [clears throat]

07:08.228 --> 07:10.061
I'm back. All done?
- For the record, miss saxton,

07:10.063 --> 07:12.097
I don't think
you killed ricky.

07:12.099 --> 07:16.301
But I get why people
think you did.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.442
- No wonder
she's such a grumpster.

07:23.444 --> 07:24.976
Girl needs to get laid.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.312
- Matty doesn't want
to get laid, he wants to talk.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.680
I can't be alone with him.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.715
I am not emotionally prepared
for the talk right now.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.018
I need another day
to process.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.553
Wait.
I have an idea.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.456
What's that thing that
you've been begging me to do

07:37.458 --> 07:38.523
Since we were kids?

07:38.525 --> 07:41.293
- [gasps]
bfgfbff!

07:41.295 --> 07:44.896
I have been dreaming
about this since I was six.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.531
And then I met you,
and then you met matty,

07:46.533 --> 07:48.033
And then you met jake,
and then you cheated

07:48.035 --> 07:49.734
On jake with matty,
and then I started dating jake,

07:49.736 --> 07:52.838
And now you're with matty,
and here we are.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.074
Our whole lives have been
building up to this moment.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.642
Bfgfbff--

07:57.644 --> 07:59.344
The boyfriend-girlfriend-
best-friends-forever

07:59.346 --> 08:00.612
Double date.
The d-d is implied.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.482
- That is completely insane,
and I am all in.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.817
- Yes! I'll call you later
with a plan.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.221
- Sure, I was using
the bfgfbff

08:09.223 --> 08:10.388
As a security blanket.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.257
But as long
as I wasn't alone with matty,

08:12.259 --> 08:15.360
I didn't have to have the talk.
[car horn honks]

08:15.362 --> 08:16.661
- Hamilton.
Get in.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.331
- I kind of feel
like walking.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.131
And not talking.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.833
- I've got your favorite candy.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.901
- He was trying to lure me

08:22.903 --> 08:25.504
Into that convo
with sugary treats.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.073
No, thanks.
- Hop in. I'll take you home.

08:28.075 --> 08:31.376
- He was trying to take me
to a second location.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.344
Stranger danger.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.479
I mean, how well
did I really know matty?

08:34.481 --> 08:35.780
- Hello?
- Clearly, not well enough

08:35.782 --> 08:37.315
To know what he wanted
to talk about.

08:37.317 --> 08:41.285
Actually, I can't.
I'm walking home with my friend.

08:41.288 --> 08:45.457
Cici.
Hi.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.592
- I guess
I'll see you tonight then?

08:47.594 --> 08:48.493
- Yes, you will.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.828
On a double date
with tamara and jake.

08:49.830 --> 08:53.965
Sorry, forgot to tell you.
Hope that's cool.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.901
- Sure, babe.

08:55.903 --> 09:01.740
- Dude,
you just got "sure-babed."

09:05.278 --> 09:07.846
- Promise you will not leave me
alone with matty.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.681
No alone time, no talk.
- No problem.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.584
I am an expert at putting
my face where it doesn't belong.

09:12.586 --> 09:16.955
- So, girls, what are we wearing
for the bfgfbff?

09:16.957 --> 09:19.758
Ooh.
Not that necklace I hope.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.059
- I thought you liked it.
- I do.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.795
But it's bad juju to wear
a gift from an ex.

09:23.797 --> 09:27.165
Not to mention weird.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.301
- Sorry, t.
I forgot.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.802
- And you just
made it weirder.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.538
- I can't believe you two don't
have more issues over this.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.774
You're so much more mature
than ally and I were.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.742
- What do you mean
we're more mature?

09:37.744 --> 09:38.710
- When ally dated my ex

09:38.712 --> 09:41.046
And we would pregame
before bfgfbffs,

09:41.048 --> 09:43.214
She would spike my drink
with prune juice

09:43.216 --> 09:46.318
So that I would have
explosive diarrhea.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.620
Thank goodness you girls
are more evolved.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.489
- Yep,
thank goodness for that.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.424
- Ming and henry?

09:52.426 --> 09:54.793
- I didn't mean
to spoil the bfgfbff,

09:54.795 --> 09:56.227
But in case you and jake
can't keep it

09:56.229 --> 09:58.029
Above the neck,
I'm gonna need reinforcements.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.432
- Okay, but I have no idea what
to call this new configuration.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.668
- Why don't we take two cars?
Jenna, you can ride with me.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.970
- Uh, this is a group date.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.172
Two is not a group.
Six is a group.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.240
Five could also
be considered a group.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.842
Four, but never two.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.245
We can fit.

10:17.216 --> 10:19.351
- Move. Move.
Move please.

10:19.353 --> 10:22.487
- Sorry, everyone.
She takes a while to warm up.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.522
[engine turns over]

10:24.524 --> 10:25.924
[engine grinding]

10:25.926 --> 10:29.761
- â™ª don't come knocking
on my back door â™ª

10:29.763 --> 10:31.863
- Jake, do you remember
this song?

10:31.865 --> 10:34.766
- Oh, yeah.
[both laughing]

10:34.768 --> 10:36.368
Lissa's party.

10:36.370 --> 10:37.268
- Yes. Be-hymen!

10:37.270 --> 10:40.105
- I will never forget that.
- Chinese fire drill!

10:40.107 --> 10:42.507
No offense.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.212
- Just--
- what are you doing?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.848
If I end up next to matty,
he might try to talk.

10:49.850 --> 10:53.718
- So stick your head
out the window.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.689
- Oh, hey. Hey.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.225
- [grunts]

11:00.227 --> 11:02.360
- What?

11:02.362 --> 11:05.430
- Back seat chinese fire drill.
No offense.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.766
- You can't call
a back seat one.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.235
- I just did.

11:22.214 --> 11:23.715
[cell phone chimes]

11:23.717 --> 11:24.783
- You should get that in case

11:24.785 --> 11:25.884
It's, like, an emergency,

11:25.886 --> 11:28.787
And you have to, like,
leave or something.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.322
- Hey, how you doing?
- Fine.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.525
Well, I am wearing soft pants.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.026
- Can we get out of here?
- Stop.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.594
- Mckibben, are you
with people?

11:36.596 --> 11:39.297
- Yeah, I can't really talk
to you right now.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.033
- Oh. Okay.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.769
- Everything all right?

11:44.771 --> 11:46.004
- Yeah.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.639
- Okay, well,
I'll call you back later.

11:47.641 --> 11:50.075
- Is that sadie? Ask her
where the bodies are buried.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.711
- Tell gingerskank
to go [bleep] herself

11:52.713 --> 11:53.945
And then forget I called.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.246
I'm fine.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.981
- She says hi.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.550
- Sounds like sadie
needs a friend.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.684
- I'll check on her later.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.086
- If you're worried
about me being alone

12:01.088 --> 12:02.253
On the group date, don't.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.755
Bonus--if you bail,
we'll have more room.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.157
And you don't really want
to come, do you?

12:06.159 --> 12:09.594
- Sure, babe.

12:11.497 --> 12:14.833
- Solo chinese fire drill!

12:14.835 --> 12:17.202
- Oh, no.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.838
No offense.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.074
[alternative music]

12:23.076 --> 12:24.175
â™ª

12:24.177 --> 12:26.411
- â™ª I'm waiting
for your call â™ª

12:26.413 --> 12:29.414
- Who ever heard of needing
a reservation

12:29.416 --> 12:30.749
At a thai place?

12:30.751 --> 12:33.184
- I don't want to point
any fingers, but--

12:33.186 --> 12:34.352
- Point that thing
at yourself.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.920
This bfg whatever was your idea,

12:35.922 --> 12:37.255
But at least it's over.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.457
- No, no, no, no, no.
It's not over.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.793
Why don't we go to the thai
place at the strip mall?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.862
- Ooh, yeah!
- My legs are numb.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.563
[engine turns over]
- over here.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.833
Henry shouldn't have to sit
on ming all night.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.903
- Are we gonna spend the entire
night in the freaking car?

12:51.905 --> 12:53.104
- She's warming back up.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.707
- And so was matty.
- Maybe we should split up.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.309
- Fine by me.
- The group date was a bust.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.611
But matty and I
were all good.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.147
It was finally safe
to go our separate ways

13:02.149 --> 13:04.082
Because he was doing
the move to the boob.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.552
We were going to get down
in a way that didn't need words.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.687
- Finally,
we'll be able to talk.

13:09.689 --> 13:13.925
- Oh, the night's still young.
I have an idea.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.293
Charades.
- Four words.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.628
- Personally,
I hated the game.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.464
But the not-talking part
had its obvious appeal.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.598
- Cooking.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.467
- Cross guard.
- Tv show.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.468
- Pulling four horses.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.370
- Matty was giving me
every reason to believe

13:25.372 --> 13:26.704
The roller coaster ride
was over

13:26.706 --> 13:29.007
And it was safe to unfasten
my insecurity belt.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.509
- Nun? He's a nun.
- A guy in the curtain.

13:31.511 --> 13:35.346
- Fred wu is here!
- [giggles]

13:37.016 --> 13:38.983
- Anyone care to explain
the new boyfriend,

13:38.985 --> 13:41.186
Ex-boyfriend on the same date?
- Uh, hello?

13:41.188 --> 13:42.520
Jenna, jake, matty--
same diff.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.390
- But I'm not putting my tongue
down jenna's throat.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.891
- Ming, your presence
is requested

13:46.893 --> 13:51.563
On a three-way
live conference call, now.

13:51.565 --> 13:54.332
[music volume increases]
- â™ª don't you know that... â™ª

13:54.334 --> 13:56.501
- Why did you turn up
the music?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.069
- The house has eyes.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.471
And ears.
Both: Asian mafia.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.007
- Ming,
if you're still with fred,

14:03.009 --> 14:05.076
Who the hell is henry?
- My beard.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.145
I've been asian bitching becca
for months.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.147
I wasn't just staying
at my grandparents'

14:09.149 --> 14:10.515
This summer to learn mandarin.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.384
I was seeing fred on the low.

14:13.386 --> 14:16.754
- And becca has no idea.
- More like no evidence.

14:16.756 --> 14:20.558
But I asian bitched you bitches,
and you didn't know.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.292
[laughs]

14:21.294 --> 14:23.094
- Ming's paranoia
was contagious.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.762
With my reinforcements
off the clock,

14:24.764 --> 14:26.798
I needed
to keep up the game.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.166
My turn.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.133
[laughs]

14:29.135 --> 14:31.803
- All right, let's do it.

14:31.805 --> 14:35.173
- Uh, movie.
- Yes.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.341
- Four words.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.809
- Two.
- No, second word is...

14:37.811 --> 14:41.212
- Brushing, washing, shower.
- Comb. So dirty.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.380
- Monkey tail--
oh, shower.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.215
Monkey, showering monkeys.
- No. Hairy.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.719
- Lovers. Lovers. Star-crossed.
- Blossoming.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.188
- No, a rom-com.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.156
- <i>Running man.</i>
<i>-</i> The 1980s?

14:52.158 --> 14:53.758
A rom-com from the '80s?

14:53.760 --> 14:54.926
- â™ª tell me that

14:54.928 --> 14:56.027
- And that we saw together.

14:56.029 --> 14:59.497
Did we go to the movies or--
oh, no, on tv--

14:59.499 --> 15:01.399
God, I should know this.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.234
Uh...

15:03.236 --> 15:05.436
That weekend
that we both had colds.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.537
Oh, <i>when harry met sally!</i>

15:06.539 --> 15:09.707
- Yes! Yeah!
- Yes! All right. Whoo-hoo!

15:09.709 --> 15:11.042
- Whoo! Bam.
- Boom.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.243
- Yeah, team j and j.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.578
- Matty may have sucked
at charades,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.613
But it wasn't hard
to pick up on his clues.

15:15.615 --> 15:20.919
Reality show, four words,
matty wanted to talk.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.761
- Jenna, I need to use
the bathroom.

15:29.763 --> 15:30.528
- Okay.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.931
- No, I need to use
the bathroom, bathroom.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.399
- So then use
my parents' bathroom.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.168
- No, I need to use
the bathroom, bathroom,

15:37.170 --> 15:40.405
Bathroom, bathroom.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.172
- Um--

15:41.174 --> 15:42.440
- I gotta make a call.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.944
- So why are we in the bathroom,
bathroom, bathroom, bathroom?

15:45.946 --> 15:47.979
- Because you're ruining
the bfgfbff.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.181
I can't speak for matty,
but I can speak for myself.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.151
This thing with you and jake--
you got to rein it in.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.585
I don't know
if you got the memo,

15:54.587 --> 15:57.255
But jakenna is dead,
and jakara is in business.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.223
I don't want
to borrow this.

15:59.225 --> 16:03.628
And I'm not borrowing jake
from you.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.631
- I'm sorry.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.498
- I forgive you.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.500
Now I'm gonna speak
for matty.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.102
After watching him
watching you,

16:11.104 --> 16:12.503
My take is
that he's jake-elous.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.839
No doubt in my mind
that matty's feeling insecure

16:14.841 --> 16:16.307
Because you told jake
about the maybe baby

16:16.309 --> 16:17.875
Before you told him.
- How can you tell?

16:17.877 --> 16:19.978
- 'cause I'm a communicator
and a little bit psychic.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.347
It's time you stopped worrying
about matty hurting you.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.581
You're hurting him.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.049
- Never had this problem
with jake.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.250
- 'cause jake was the girl.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.952
In our relationship,
we're both girls.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.420
That's why it works.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.456
[knocking]

16:32.257 --> 16:33.558
- I know why you're upset.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.627
And I'm sorry it took me
so long to catch on.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.030
It was so not cool.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.531
I'm a jerk.

16:40.533 --> 16:44.135
And I'm crazy about you.

16:44.137 --> 16:49.173
- Okay.
- You forgive me?

16:51.310 --> 16:54.979
- I'm gonna go...Now.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.884
- Do you still need me
to talk block?

16:59.886 --> 17:01.886
- If tamara and jake
were the poster couple

17:01.888 --> 17:04.555
For talking it out,
I needed to give matty

17:04.557 --> 17:06.190
A chance
to open his mouth too.

17:06.192 --> 17:11.628
Hoping against hope
it would end up on mine.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.964
- I know
you're not fine.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.365
- You are such a pain
in my ass.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.267
- That pain isn't going away
till you tell me what's up.

17:16.269 --> 17:20.271
- My parents are gone.
- On vacation?

17:20.272 --> 17:21.105
- From me.

17:21.107 --> 17:23.273
My mom's in rehab
for exhaustion,

17:23.276 --> 17:25.042
And dear old dad
fled the country

17:25.045 --> 17:26.176
'cause of the money sitch.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.444
- Wait, so you're all alone?

17:27.446 --> 17:29.881
- Consuela's here,
but she's in the doghouse.

17:29.883 --> 17:30.882
- Why, what'd she do?

17:30.884 --> 17:32.350
- Nothing. She's cleaning it.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.386
Matty, no one wants
to be around me.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.022
At school,
everyone hates me.

17:38.024 --> 17:42.193
And at home, no one cares
if I'm alive or dead.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.897
I may as well be ricky.

17:45.899 --> 17:46.864
I'm scared.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.766
- You're not thinking
of hurting yourself, are you?

17:48.768 --> 17:51.669
- No, dumbass.
I still love myself.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.005
But I do want to throw up.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.973
- Promise me you won't,
or I'll come over there

17:55.975 --> 17:56.874
And kick your ass.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.209
- Please,
I could totally take you.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.578
- I'm serious, sadie.
Swear you won't.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.712
- I swear, okay?

18:01.714 --> 18:02.880
- This family stuff sucks.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.182
You know I've been there.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.384
But you're strong.
You're gonna be okay.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.719
- I am?
- Definitely.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.721
And there's no way in hell
you could take me.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.825
- Why don't you come over here
and prove it?

18:13.827 --> 18:15.026
- I would swing by,

18:15.028 --> 18:19.764
But I have to have
a conversation with jenna.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.201
- So have it.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.239
- I gotta go.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.007
- I know you've been wanting
to have this talk all day,

18:30.009 --> 18:31.576
And I'm sorry
I've been avoiding it.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.644
But if this is gonna be the talk
where you break up with me,

18:33.646 --> 18:35.046
Then we are not having
this talk

18:35.048 --> 18:36.314
Because I am breaking up
with you first.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.448
So there.
Talk over.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.984
- That's not this talk.

18:39.986 --> 18:44.188
- Good.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.189
What's going on?

18:45.191 --> 18:47.959
- Last week you didn't want me
to touch you,

18:47.961 --> 18:54.031
And then today you wanted
to do it in the sanctuary.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.134
- Are you upset
that I didn't tell you

18:56.136 --> 18:57.235
About the pregnancy sitch?

18:57.237 --> 18:59.871
- No, I'm upset
that you told jake before me.

18:59.873 --> 19:04.942
And that we don't have
that thing you and jake had.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.277
Have.
- What thing?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.246
A friendship?
- I guess, yeah.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.247
Why can't we have that?

19:09.249 --> 19:10.982
Why can't I be that for you?
- Be what?

19:10.984 --> 19:12.717
- The guy you don't
have to sleep with

19:12.719 --> 19:13.985
To be connected to, jenna.

19:13.987 --> 19:18.289
The guy
you can say anything to.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.558
- I'm sorry
I told jake.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.661
He was just there,
and it came out.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.062
- That is
exactly the point.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.231
It's always so easy
with jake.

19:27.233 --> 19:30.935
Why is it not easy
with me?

19:34.373 --> 19:38.176
- I guess
I'm just always afraid

19:38.178 --> 19:41.345
The minute anything bad happens,
you're gonna run away.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.780
- Why would you think that?

19:42.782 --> 19:45.183
- Because you were
embarrassed of me.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.584
- When?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.686
- After we first had sex.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.954
We never talked.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.189
We just hooked up.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.690
And then when we did talk,

19:52.692 --> 19:54.792
It was only in private.

19:54.794 --> 20:01.499
I'd call that embarrassment,
wouldn't you?

20:01.501 --> 20:03.434
- No.

20:03.436 --> 20:06.604
I was never embarrassed
of you.

20:06.606 --> 20:10.575
- â™ª forget to write this down

20:10.577 --> 20:13.044
â™ª

20:13.046 --> 20:14.745
- So how do we fix this?

20:14.747 --> 20:17.148
How do we--
I don't know.

20:17.150 --> 20:21.485
Talk and--

20:21.487 --> 20:23.554
- We already have.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.090
â™ª

20:26.092 --> 20:31.662
- â™ª would you stay
with us tonight? â™ª

20:31.664 --> 20:35.466
â™ª

20:35.468 --> 20:37.868
â™ª would you

20:37.870 --> 20:38.903
- Next on <i>awkward...</i>

20:38.905 --> 20:40.605
Hey, so my dad called
your parents and told them

20:40.607 --> 20:42.006
We're having sex.
Gotta go, bye.

20:42.008 --> 20:45.476
- What do you have to say
to mr. And mrs. Hamilton?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.712
- Everyone's talking about
how your parents are broke.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.747
- I was totally ready
to do it with you,

20:49.749 --> 20:51.015
But I was waiting
on something.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.984
Right now,
I am too excited to wait.

20:52.986 --> 20:53.618
- What?

20:53.620 --> 20:56.887
- I'm ready, okay?
- Okay.
