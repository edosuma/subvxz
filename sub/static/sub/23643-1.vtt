26:11.792 --> 26:13.292
Get down.

26:21.042 --> 26:22.962
Get down!

26:44.667 --> 26:45.877
Now...

26:47.208 --> 26:48.578
Take it.

26:53.667 --> 26:55.667
I do not fear death.

40:36.458 --> 40:37.918
Don't you take another step!

40:41.167 --> 40:42.747
What do you want?

40:45.125 --> 40:49.205
I am Black Hawk.

40:49.917 --> 40:54.747
Son of Chief Yellow Hawk.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.420
I know who you are.

40:58.167 --> 41:00.377
What do you want?

41:02.542 --> 41:04.212
My wife...

41:04.750 --> 41:06.250
...Elk Woman.

41:06.958 --> 41:09.078
Our son, Little Bear.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.625
And my sister, Living Woman.

41:14.208 --> 41:17.788
A gift... for the lady.

41:19.417 --> 41:21.917
I would...

41:21.958 --> 41:24.208
be honored...

41:25.083 --> 41:27.753
...if she would wear these.

41:54.917 --> 41:56.287
And Captain, I--

41:56.625 --> 41:57.955
Enough!

41:59.125 --> 42:00.375
Sit down.

45:29.875 --> 45:32.665
Experiencing loss such as she has...

45:34.167 --> 45:38.787
...requires great strength.

45:42.250 --> 45:44.670
The Comanche are still near.

45:44.708 --> 45:48.918
They are Rattlesnake people. The worst kind.

45:51.042 --> 45:53.422
I know who they are.

45:53.458 --> 45:56.578
They do not discriminate.

45:57.583 --> 46:01.463
They will track and attack your party. Ours, too.

46:03.167 --> 46:05.167
We are ready for them.

46:05.625 --> 46:07.915
You don't understand
how grave the situation.

46:07.958 --> 46:09.748
They are of unsound mind.

46:09.792 --> 46:12.382
And very dangerous.

46:14.208 --> 46:16.328
Remove the binds.

46:16.375 --> 46:19.205
We can be of great help.

46:22.250 --> 46:26.750
I'm not removing them.

46:29.333 --> 46:31.583
You are making this
more difficult than necessary.

51:57.625 --> 51:58.705
Captain?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.250
What?

52:01.167 --> 52:04.037
The Chief is still uneasy.

52:04.500 --> 52:08.670
He says Comanche will soon return.

52:10.750 --> 52:12.330
He thinks we should...

52:13.208 --> 52:14.328
talk to them.

52:15.042 --> 52:18.422
You and us.

52:20.042 --> 52:21.582
I disagree.

52:21.625 --> 52:22.495
But Captain--

52:22.542 --> 52:23.882
Hold your tongue.

52:25.042 --> 52:27.212
I've given you my opinion.

52:27.500 --> 52:28.420
I told you.

52:29.500 --> 52:32.130
We must stand as one or they will kill us.

52:32.875 --> 52:35.415
When one hunts for a rattlesnake...

52:35.458 --> 52:37.328
...one may find it.

52:38.208 --> 52:39.748
But it bites...

52:39.792 --> 52:44.042
before one can ever see it.

1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:36.040
Thank you.

1:12:44.167 --> 1:12:47.377
I am Elk Woman.

1:20:22.875 --> 1:20:24.125
Father!

1:20:24.167 --> 1:20:25.127
Grandfather!

1:20:28.125 --> 1:20:28.995
Tell me.

1:20:29.042 --> 1:20:31.962
They've taken Mother!

1:20:58.833 --> 1:21:00.543
Horses with iron feet.

1:21:23.875 --> 1:21:26.245
Fur hunters. Three of them.

1:22:58.833 --> 1:23:01.543
When whitemen return to their shelter...

1:23:02.042 --> 1:23:04.252
we advance.

1:23:06.125 --> 1:23:07.745
As one.

1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.040
You are not well.

1:23:11.208 --> 1:23:13.328
We will handle them.

1:23:14.333 --> 1:23:16.883
My daughter. I lead.

1:23:17.250 --> 1:23:18.630
We discuss no further.

1:29:19.875 --> 1:29:21.075
Chief...

1:29:24.250 --> 1:29:26.880
I'm sorry for what happened to the women.

1:29:35.583 --> 1:29:38.503
Is there anything I can do to help?

1:29:46.250 --> 1:29:50.040
The rains are approaching. We should move.

1:33:11.042 --> 1:33:12.542
Chief...

1:33:20.583 --> 1:33:22.253
Chief...

1:33:30.250 --> 1:33:33.330
Our treatment of the Natives
cannot be forgiven.

1:33:34.542 --> 1:33:35.422
Please...

1:33:36.125 --> 1:33:37.825
accept this tobacco.

1:33:46.875 --> 1:33:49.785
Have mercy on us.

1:38:05.292 --> 1:38:06.582
For you, Grandpapa.

1:38:06.833 --> 1:38:09.133
To make you feel better.

1:38:13.042 --> 1:38:15.132
Thank you for this gift.

1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:20.130
It will give me life.

1:47:56.917 --> 1:47:58.417
Are you well enough to continue?

1:47:58.917 --> 1:48:00.167
Very soon.

1:48:01.167 --> 1:48:07.827
After my body is nourished by the earth.

1:48:10.167 --> 1:48:13.077
We're very close to your home.

1:48:15.208 --> 1:48:17.128
You speak the truth.

1:48:25.500 --> 1:48:27.080
Chief...

1:48:32.375 --> 1:48:34.955
I had a friend...

1:48:42.583 --> 1:48:45.253
I had a friend...

1:48:54.458 --> 1:48:56.878
I had a friend...

1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:10.830
I lost many friends
and you have lost many as well.

1:49:14.667 --> 1:49:17.627
They are a great loss for us both...

1:49:18.500 --> 1:49:23.920
but we know death comes to us all.

1:49:45.750 --> 1:49:50.500
Don't look back, my friend.

1:49:51.875 --> 1:49:53.955
Go in a good way.

1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:57.250
A part of me dies with you.

1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:48.000
Valley of the Bears, Montana

1:51:08.083 --> 1:51:09.883
We're home.

1:51:13.667 --> 1:51:16.207
It's never looked more beautiful.

2:03:04.292 --> 2:03:06.582
Little Bear, a gift.

2:03:07.917 --> 2:03:11.417
It's now your time to put this to use.

2:03:13.542 --> 2:03:15.132
Caesar...

2:03:16.208 --> 2:03:19.038
one of the bravest men I've ever read.

2:03:25.458 --> 2:03:26.708
Thank you.

2:03:26.732 --> 2:03:31.732
