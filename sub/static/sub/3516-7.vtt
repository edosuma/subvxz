Set them up over here.

02:53.175 --> 02:55.261
[Chattering]

03:09.733 --> 03:11.819
[Chattering]

03:32.298 --> 03:34.342
Vice President Matthews.

03:35.843 --> 03:38.596
- Bob.
- Mr. Vice President.

03:57.573 --> 03:59.908
- Mr. Vice President.
- Frank.

04:04.664 --> 04:07.041
[Quietly] Sir, I'm gonna need
you to stand on your mark.

04:07.042 --> 04:08.792
I'm fine right here.

04:20.887 --> 04:22.390
Two minutes, people.

04:22.391 --> 04:24.099
So they pull me from the car.

04:24.100 --> 04:27.603
Both legs broken, fractured
skull, punctured lung.

04:27.604 --> 04:30.439
My heart stops. Two full minutes.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.941
They're pumping my chest. Nothing.

04:32.942 --> 04:35.027
They grab the defibrillators. Pachoom!

04:35.028 --> 04:36.696
Nothing.

04:36.697 --> 04:39.657
Third time, the pistons start firing.

04:39.658 --> 04:41.992
Doctors tell me it's a miracle I'm alive.

04:41.993 --> 04:44.495
But, seriously, you talk
about a wake-up call from God.

04:44.496 --> 04:48.165
You don't get to come
back from the dead twice.

04:51.544 --> 04:53.837
[Woman] The President of the United States.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.508
[Applause]

05:07.184 --> 05:09.937
Good morning.

05:09.938 --> 05:11.313
"The education reform and achievement act

05:11.314 --> 05:13.482
that I sign into law today

05:13.483 --> 05:16.485
will affect every child and
parent in the United States,

05:16.486 --> 05:20.197
will ensure a better educated
workforce for decades to come,

05:20.198 --> 05:23.409
and will reinforce America's preeminence

05:23.410 --> 05:25.327
as an intellectual superpower.

05:27.788 --> 05:30.165
And I'd like to thank
one man in particular

05:30.166 --> 05:32.543
who never lost sight
of the larger mission,

05:32.544 --> 05:35.504
who spearheaded this
bill from the beginning,

05:35.505 --> 05:37.673
and that's congressman Frank Underwood."

05:40.301 --> 05:41.885
[No audible dialogue]

06:01.113 --> 06:03.324
[Cheering]

06:08.912 --> 06:10.914
[Chattering]

06:13.815 --> 06:16.068
[Woman] Invited guests, please join us

06:16.069 --> 06:17.945
in the east room for refreshments.

06:17.946 --> 06:19.905
Media, we will convene immediately

06:19.906 --> 06:22.617
in the briefing room for our conference.

06:29.868 --> 06:31.661
Linda, thank you so much
for all the help you gave us

06:31.662 --> 06:32.662
in getting this bill passed.

06:32.663 --> 06:33.998
No, thank you, Frank.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.791
This was your baby from the beginning.

06:35.792 --> 06:38.043
I appreciate you standing
your ground on this one, Frank.

06:38.044 --> 06:40.546
I'm smart enough to admit when I was wrong.

06:40.547 --> 06:43.048
I was just telling Frank
we should set up a weekly

06:43.049 --> 06:45.050
so he can keep us up to date
on what's going on in the house.

06:45.051 --> 06:46.802
That sounds like a great idea.

06:46.803 --> 06:48.762
Congratulations, sir.

06:48.763 --> 06:52.016
Garrett, I was wondering if we
could talk for a few minutes.

06:52.017 --> 06:54.893
That thing I mentioned a couple of
weeks ago about the jobs tax credit... 

06:54.894 --> 06:56.103
I've been giving it a lot of thought, Jim,

06:56.104 --> 06:58.147
and I think it's a good idea.

06:58.148 --> 07:00.899
But I'd like to look over my
notes first, if you don't mind,

07:00.900 --> 07:03.235
so I can talk about it
intelligently with you.

07:03.236 --> 07:05.488
Sir, you have your call
with the Prime Minister.

07:05.489 --> 07:07.823
Busy man.

07:07.824 --> 07:09.741
Yes, he is.

07:09.742 --> 07:13.621
Frank, I hear that you are heading up

07:13.622 --> 07:15.665
the special election in my home state.

07:15.666 --> 07:17.249
- Peter Russo.
- We're trying to keep that

07:17.250 --> 07:19.460
under the radar until
he officially announces.

07:19.461 --> 07:22.087
In fact, we're not even working
out of my office until that happens.

07:22.088 --> 07:24.756
- Where are you working from?
- The basement of my house.

07:24.757 --> 07:28.636
Any reason why the D.N.C. didn't
ask my advice on the candidate?

07:28.637 --> 07:31.180
Well, I thought they passed
it by you, or Linda did.

07:31.181 --> 07:34.058
- Nobody did.
- Well, that is unacceptable.

07:34.059 --> 07:35.934
And I have major doubts about Russo.

07:35.935 --> 07:39.480
- His inexperience? -
Yes, and he's urban-based.

07:39.481 --> 07:41.732
- Mm.
- I don't know if he'll connect with rural voters.

07:41.733 --> 07:43.609
Look, frankly, that's one
of my concerns as well.

07:43.610 --> 07:45.152
We're working on that.

07:45.153 --> 07:47.779
But if you were to come
out and stump with him,

07:47.780 --> 07:50.241
that would go a long way to convince... 

07:50.242 --> 07:52.410
Frank, I can't stump for
somebody I don't believe in.

07:52.411 --> 07:55.413
It's early days yet. I'd
ask you to keep an open mind.

07:55.414 --> 07:56.830
And let me know if you want me

07:56.831 --> 07:59.166
to set up a meeting between the two of you,

07:59.167 --> 08:00.668
because, sir, an endorsement from you

08:00.669 --> 08:02.545
would be a big coup for him.

08:02.546 --> 08:04.838
It's good to see you, Mr. Vice President.

08:04.839 --> 08:06.757
Frank.

08:17.184 --> 08:19.270
Congressman Underwood?

08:20.605 --> 08:22.648
Miss Barnes, I was under the impression

08:22.649 --> 08:24.400
you didn't wanna cover the White House.

08:24.401 --> 08:25.817
Slugline just got access yesterday.

08:25.818 --> 08:27.653
- I know.
- I left the herald

08:27.654 --> 08:28.820
because I didn't wanna
cover the White House,

08:28.821 --> 08:30.239
and now here I am.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.823
Access isn't the same as a ball and chain.

08:32.825 --> 08:35.620
Am I only gonna see you
at bill signings now?

08:35.621 --> 08:37.288
I haven't heard from you in three weeks.

08:37.289 --> 08:39.081
Insecurity bores me.

08:39.082 --> 08:42.418
I feel the same way about condescension.

08:42.419 --> 08:43.876
Your place, this evening,

08:43.878 --> 08:45.546
and I'll text you when I'm about to arrive.

08:45.547 --> 08:47.632
What if I'm busy?

08:47.633 --> 08:50.217
You're just afraid I'm
gonna stand you up again.

08:50.218 --> 08:52.553
I just wanna make sure it's worth my while.

08:52.554 --> 08:54.472
It'll be worth your while.

08:54.473 --> 08:56.348
This'll make up for last time.

08:56.349 --> 08:57.642
It's a piece of history.

08:57.643 --> 09:00.352
From the President's hand to yours.

09:03.105 --> 09:04.856
[Russo] You believe in
all that higher-power stuff

09:04.857 --> 09:06.567
they talk about in the room?

09:06.568 --> 09:09.612
I believe there are
things beyond our control.

09:09.613 --> 09:11.739
Who or what's controlling
them... that I don't know.

09:11.740 --> 09:13.658
I don't believe in God.

09:13.659 --> 09:15.785
Heaven, hell. None of it.

09:15.786 --> 09:18.829
- Too much catholic school?
- Maybe.

09:18.830 --> 09:21.915
I'm not saying you have
to believe in God, Peter,

09:21.916 --> 09:23.542
or anything, for that matter.

09:23.543 --> 09:25.503
But you shouldn't rule anything out.

09:32.134 --> 09:34.094
I should go.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.554
It's on the campaign.

10:25.396 --> 10:27.481
[Chattering]

10:31.527 --> 10:34.071
[Taminini] Our cross tabs
show 81% of likely voters

10:34.072 --> 10:35.989
are willing to consider
a recovering alcoholic.

10:35.990 --> 10:37.742
Now, those numbers dip a little

10:37.743 --> 10:40.452
when you introduce cocaine,
but not by much. Randy?

10:40.453 --> 10:42.246
It's a risk, but it'll make waves.

10:42.247 --> 10:43.873
Free coverage across the board.

10:43.874 --> 10:45.416
The narrative has to be redemption.

10:45.417 --> 10:46.876
A Phoenix from the ashes.

10:46.877 --> 10:48.836
[Frank] Well, let's not focus on the ashes.

10:48.837 --> 10:51.129
We don't want people to
think Peter was a disaster.

10:51.130 --> 10:53.257
[Randy] No, no. We focus on the positive.

10:53.258 --> 10:54.675
A "fresh start" and a "clean start"

10:54.676 --> 10:56.260
both did well in focus groups.

10:56.261 --> 10:58.804
"Clean start" sounds too
much like "clean slate."

10:58.805 --> 11:00.681
I like "fresh start." Yeah, I do too.

11:00.682 --> 11:02.974
- How we doing on the
fund-raising? - The alcoholic thing

11:02.975 --> 11:04.184
will turn off some of the in-state donors,

11:04.185 --> 11:05.936
but it's an off-year election.

11:05.937 --> 11:08.063
We can hit up the usual suspects
in New York and California.

11:08.064 --> 11:10.524
Walter, how vulnerable are we?

11:10.525 --> 11:12.860
I'm not prepared to answer that question.

11:12.861 --> 11:14.111
Peter and I have yet to perform

11:14.112 --> 11:16.154
the holy sacrament of confession.

11:16.155 --> 11:18.741
- [Laughter]
- We still need to address the shipyard closing too.

11:18.742 --> 11:20.868
[Frank] Claire's helping us with that.

11:20.869 --> 11:22.202
We are pushing a bill

11:22.203 --> 11:24.455
called the Delaware river watershed act,

11:24.456 --> 11:27.082
and I think it's going
to bring about 5,000 jobs

11:27.083 --> 11:29.209
into Peter's district
over the next three years.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.128
We have a draft of the bill completed.

11:31.129 --> 11:33.798
Peter's in the process
of securing cosponsors.

11:33.799 --> 11:35.883
And who have you called, by the way?

11:35.884 --> 11:37.718
I have some e-mails out,

11:37.719 --> 11:39.428
but most of them wanna see a bill first.

11:39.429 --> 11:40.888
Have you set up a meeting
with the shipbuilders yet?

11:40.889 --> 11:42.640
I don't think they're gonna back me.

11:42.641 --> 11:44.767
That's the entire point of the bill, Peter.

11:44.768 --> 11:46.852
Well, if I go to them and I say,

11:46.853 --> 11:49.104
"hey, some of you maybe
will get your jobs back,

11:49.105 --> 11:51.690
"not tomorrow, but three years from now,

11:51.691 --> 11:53.776
and most of you won't be
getting your jobs back anyway... "

11:53.777 --> 11:54.984
all right, let's put a pin in this

11:54.985 --> 11:56.654
until we get more sponsors.

11:56.655 --> 11:58.739
I have to go to the office.
I'll catch you all later.

11:58.740 --> 12:00.449
Okay, let's move on to our field plan.

12:00.450 --> 12:02.409
I want to go through
the regions one by one... 

12:02.410 --> 12:04.495
Francis.

12:04.496 --> 12:06.872
We spent six weeks on that bill.

12:06.873 --> 12:09.458
It'll be fine. He'll come around.

12:09.459 --> 12:10.751
[Sighs]

12:10.752 --> 12:12.670
I'll see you later tonight?

12:12.671 --> 12:14.171
I have an appointment.

12:14.172 --> 12:15.798
So I won't see you until morning.

12:15.799 --> 12:18.175
I'll be back before you get up.

12:21.303 --> 12:23.973
I appreciate your taking
the time today, sir.

12:23.974 --> 12:25.557
Did you get that tax credit memo

12:25.558 --> 12:27.225
the economic research team put together?

12:27.226 --> 12:29.520
You didn't ask me here to talk about memos.

12:29.521 --> 12:31.396
I know small talk when I hear it, Linda.

12:31.397 --> 12:32.773
The President has asked

12:32.774 --> 12:34.859
that you take a step
back from Pennsylvania.

12:34.860 --> 12:37.235
You've been taking a lot of trips
there, meeting with legislators... 

12:37.236 --> 12:39.321
it's my home state. There's a jobs crisis.

12:39.322 --> 12:41.323
We can't afford to play favorites.

12:41.324 --> 12:43.534
The message is 50 states, one solution;

12:43.535 --> 12:45.577
not one state, 50 solutions.

12:45.578 --> 12:48.831
I never expected to be involved
in every policy or decision,

12:48.832 --> 12:52.167
but I have been completely
cut out of everything.

12:52.168 --> 12:54.628
We value your input, Mr. Vice President,

12:54.629 --> 12:56.839
- but right now, we can't... 
- Don't condescend, Linda.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.424
No one even asked me who I
thought should fill my seat.

12:59.425 --> 13:01.927
Why is Frank Underwood leading
the charge on that, not me?

13:01.928 --> 13:03.387
That is a D.N.C. issue.

13:03.388 --> 13:05.806
We are staying out of it and so should you.

13:05.807 --> 13:09.018
And so I'm supposed to just
cut ribbons and go to funerals?

13:09.019 --> 13:11.645
You knew what you signed up for.

13:12.688 --> 13:14.857
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

13:17.651 --> 13:19.653
I didn't get my pen.

13:20.779 --> 13:23.323
- Your pen?
- From the bill signing.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.785
Oh, we'll see what we can do about that.

13:31.415 --> 13:34.543
[People chattering, music thumping]

13:37.170 --> 13:39.381
[Zoe] I can see your security guy.

13:39.382 --> 13:40.382
[Frank] Meechum?

13:40.383 --> 13:43.010
He's cute.

13:43.011 --> 13:45.136
He'd never go for you.

13:45.137 --> 13:46.513
Why not?

13:46.514 --> 13:48.306
You're too intimidating.

13:48.307 --> 13:50.434
He's the one with the gun.

13:50.435 --> 13:53.395
But you're the one with the congressman.

13:55.522 --> 13:56.690
Uh-uh.

13:56.691 --> 13:58.483
We'll talk after.

13:58.484 --> 14:00.527
We'll talk before.

14:02.613 --> 14:04.364
Peter Russo.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.199
Pennsylvania's first district.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.077
He's gonna run for governor.

14:08.078 --> 14:09.494
Fill Matthews' seat.

14:09.495 --> 14:11.538
It's an exclusive profile.

14:11.539 --> 14:13.749
With someone no one's ever heard of.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.459
What's the angle?

14:15.460 --> 14:16.961
Alcohol, drugs.

14:16.962 --> 14:18.796
He's a kid from the streets.

14:18.797 --> 14:21.214
I want the profile to come
out as soon as he announces,

14:21.215 --> 14:23.258
and I'd like it to be kind.

14:23.259 --> 14:25.218
I don't write puff pieces.

14:25.219 --> 14:27.429
Then get someone else to write it.

14:27.430 --> 14:29.180
I thought you had something for me.

14:29.181 --> 14:31.850
It's too easy for people
to link me as your source.

14:31.851 --> 14:34.269
It's dangerous.

14:34.270 --> 14:38.315
I don't benefit from handing
out headlines to other people.

14:43.821 --> 14:47.950
Generosity is its own form of power, Zoe.

14:53.122 --> 14:56.166
[Woman] Step six.

14:56.167 --> 14:59.962
[Continues, faint]

15:04.883 --> 15:06.677
Step seven.

15:06.678 --> 15:08.804
[Continues, faint]

15:26.363 --> 15:28.532
You always wear sunglasses at night?

15:31.869 --> 15:33.912
How did you find me?

15:33.913 --> 15:36.206
I figured you had to be in government.

15:36.207 --> 15:37.749
I kept googling till I found your picture.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.751
This won't work, what you're doing.

15:39.752 --> 15:41.837
It was a one-time deal.

15:41.838 --> 15:44.798
- You don't get to keep coming back for more.
- I'll go to the police.

15:44.799 --> 15:47.384
They'll laugh in your face. Look at you.

15:47.385 --> 15:50.054
If the police won't listen to me,

15:50.055 --> 15:52.222
I'll call TV stations.

15:52.223 --> 15:54.558
I know the names... 

15:54.559 --> 15:56.810
Douglas Stamper, Peter Russo,

15:56.811 --> 15:58.645
Frank Underwood.

15:58.646 --> 16:01.773
You are walking down a road
you do not want to walk down.

16:08.155 --> 16:11.241
Please, I won't call anyone.

16:12.242 --> 16:14.119
But I need your help.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.747
I don't have anywhere to go.
I don't have anyone I can call.

16:16.748 --> 16:19.917
I've had to do things. And
I don't wanna do it anymore.

16:29.051 --> 16:31.261
That's all I've got right now.

16:31.262 --> 16:34.139
Find a place to stay and
let me know where you are.

16:34.140 --> 16:36.600
I'll figure something out.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.069
You hungry?

16:56.369 --> 16:59.039
What's your name?

16:59.040 --> 17:00.457
Sapphire.

17:00.458 --> 17:03.210
No. What's your name?

17:06.046 --> 17:08.048
Rachel.

17:09.424 --> 17:11.885
Your ex-wife... anything uncouth?

17:11.886 --> 17:14.637
- How do you mean?
- Bondage, orgies, water sports?

17:14.638 --> 17:16.513
- No. Definitely not.
- Narcotics?

17:16.515 --> 17:19.226
- She wasn't into that.
- Not even a little ganga?

17:19.227 --> 17:22.020
- Okay. Once in a blue moon.
- Ever with your children?

17:22.021 --> 17:24.189
- God, no!
- Ever in front of them?

17:24.190 --> 17:25.356
Look, I'm not the world's best dad,

17:25.357 --> 17:27.151
but I would never do that.

17:27.152 --> 17:28.735
Fine. Let's move on to prostitution.

17:28.736 --> 17:30.237
How long is this gonna take?

17:30.238 --> 17:31.738
Until there's nothing
I don't know about you.

17:31.739 --> 17:33.198
I wrote all this down.

17:33.199 --> 17:36.118
I've been doing this a
long time, congressman.

17:36.119 --> 17:38.411
I know when I've scraped
all the shit off the shoe.

17:41.372 --> 17:43.041
Prostitution.

17:47.337 --> 17:49.464
After my divorce, I
took a trip to Thailand.

17:49.465 --> 17:50.674
It was about two weeks.

17:50.675 --> 17:53.468
How many women?

17:53.469 --> 17:55.637
Ten. Fifteen.

17:55.638 --> 17:58.807
- I... I don't know. It was a bit of a blur.
- There were drugs?

17:58.808 --> 18:00.684
Uh, yes.

18:00.685 --> 18:05.022
Opium, speed, some smack.

18:05.023 --> 18:06.773
- Powder or needles?
- Both.

18:06.774 --> 18:08.233
Would any of these women know who you are?

18:08.234 --> 18:10.068
No. None of them spoke English.

18:10.069 --> 18:12.196
And I never mentioned I was a congressman.

18:12.197 --> 18:14.323
Have you mainlined heroin
back here in the States?

18:16.825 --> 18:18.869
- Just once.
- Any scars on your arm?

18:18.870 --> 18:21.705
No. I was mainly into cocaine.

18:21.706 --> 18:23.874
What about prostitutes here in D.C.?

18:23.875 --> 18:25.500
How often?

18:29.671 --> 18:32.341
- I fucked around a bit, okay?
- Details, please.

18:32.342 --> 18:34.134
Do you get off on this or something?

18:34.135 --> 18:36.178
Does a doctor enjoy it
when he cups your balls

18:36.179 --> 18:37.929
and asks you to cough?

18:37.930 --> 18:39.597
You wanna know how many times I came?

18:39.598 --> 18:41.474
I honestly don't care whether you win.

18:41.475 --> 18:43.810
But if you do, work with me.

18:43.811 --> 18:46.563
How often did you solicit
prostitutes in D.C.?

18:46.564 --> 18:49.024
Once every two or three months.

18:49.025 --> 18:50.734
Sometimes more frequently, sometimes less.

18:50.735 --> 18:52.527
Do you have reason to believe
any of them were underage?

18:52.528 --> 18:54.363
Jesus! No. Look, they
were mostly high-end.

18:54.364 --> 18:55.613
That doesn't mean they were 18.

18:55.614 --> 18:57.282
I need a fucking break!

19:04.497 --> 19:06.499
What's going on?

19:06.500 --> 19:08.085
He's an amateur, Frank.

19:08.086 --> 19:10.045
If I can get under his
skin in less than an hour,

19:10.046 --> 19:11.755
how do you think he'll
hold up under the press?

19:11.756 --> 19:13.090
It'll be a Turkey shoot.

19:13.091 --> 19:15.592
All right. I'll speak to him.

19:23.725 --> 19:25.269
Frank, it's just... it's not gonna work.

19:25.270 --> 19:27.062
I'm gonna get crucified.

19:27.063 --> 19:29.606
You'll be fine. We've got
a crack team behind you.

19:29.607 --> 19:32.567
It doesn't matter how good the
team is. With my past? Come on.

19:32.568 --> 19:35.070
From the very beginning,
I said this was the plan.

19:35.071 --> 19:36.947
- You agreed to it.
- I didn't think it through.

19:36.948 --> 19:39.199
We have to tackle this head-on,

19:39.200 --> 19:41.492
or the G.O.P. will crucify you.

19:41.493 --> 19:43.661
We have to steal their
ammunition from them.

19:43.662 --> 19:46.998
Honesty is your best defense and offense.

19:46.999 --> 19:49.667
I'm the one that has to get in front
of these cameras and say this shit.

19:49.668 --> 19:51.669
They don't have to say it. I do.

19:51.670 --> 19:53.630
- Peter... 
- I wanna be governor. I do.

19:53.631 --> 19:55.382
But not this way. I just can't do it.

19:55.383 --> 19:57.384
If you weren't unsure now,

19:57.385 --> 19:59.677
there'd be something wrong with you.

19:59.678 --> 20:01.138
I expected this.

20:01.139 --> 20:03.181
Not easy... what we're asking you to do.

20:03.182 --> 20:06.810
It's okay to vacillate a little.

20:06.811 --> 20:08.561
I'm not trying to throw
a wrench in the works.

20:08.562 --> 20:09.938
I know you're not. I'll tell you what.

20:09.939 --> 20:12.149
You take the rest of the day off.

20:12.150 --> 20:15.277
You go back to your office, you catch
up with whatever you have to catch up on,

20:15.278 --> 20:18.071
you get a good night's sleep,
you go to a meeting tomorrow,

20:18.072 --> 20:20.615
and then you come here and we'll
talk the whole thing through.

20:20.616 --> 20:23.243
Can you give me at least that?

20:23.244 --> 20:25.245
Yeah. Okay, Frank.

20:25.246 --> 20:27.164
Good.

20:46.183 --> 20:49.853
What's going on with all
the little sculptures?

20:49.854 --> 20:51.938
I found a flower on the dining room table

20:51.939 --> 20:55.442
and a bird on the
nightstand a few days ago.

20:56.693 --> 20:58.736
It's a swan.

20:58.737 --> 21:00.405
You made them?

21:00.406 --> 21:02.073
Yes.

21:02.074 --> 21:04.159
A new hobby?

21:06.286 --> 21:08.579
No.

21:08.580 --> 21:10.707
It's an interest.

21:19.549 --> 21:22.927
May I bring up something else I've noticed?

21:22.928 --> 21:25.680
What's that?

21:25.681 --> 21:28.350
You... 

21:28.351 --> 21:31.353
Standing in front of the refrigerator.

21:33.271 --> 21:36.358
Is there a reason you
haven't talked to me about it?

21:36.359 --> 21:38.527
I haven't felt the need to.

21:38.528 --> 21:40.111
Is it bad?

21:42.697 --> 21:45.409
It's not pleasant.

21:45.410 --> 21:47.952
But, no, it's not bad.

21:47.953 --> 21:49.246
What can I do?

21:51.540 --> 21:53.208
Nothing.

21:53.209 --> 21:55.335
If there was something, I'd ask.

22:06.054 --> 22:09.766
- Did you think it was weird that I called you?
- Totally weird.

22:09.767 --> 22:13.770
Except for the fact that I
was planning on calling you.

22:13.771 --> 22:15.772
Really? Why?

22:15.773 --> 22:18.483
I was a real grade-a
bitch to you at the herald,

22:18.484 --> 22:21.736
and I almost apologized when
I saw you at the White House,

22:21.737 --> 22:23.405
but I chickened out.

22:23.406 --> 22:26.324
So, anyway, I am drunk
enough, and I am sorry.

22:26.325 --> 22:28.368
Why did you call me?

22:28.369 --> 22:31.746
I was just wondering how things were
going at the old stomping ground.

22:31.747 --> 22:33.873
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

22:33.874 --> 22:36.209
It's just not the same since tom left.

22:36.210 --> 22:39.087
And I don't blame you
for doing what you did.

22:39.088 --> 22:42.882
But this new guy? Six
years running E.W. Online

22:42.883 --> 22:45.093
does not a managing editor make.

22:45.094 --> 22:48.388
Would you ever wanna come work with us?

22:48.389 --> 22:50.181
I mean, it'd be a huge fucking deal.

22:50.182 --> 22:52.601
Chief political correspondent of the herald

22:52.602 --> 22:54.185
moves to Slugline?

22:54.186 --> 22:56.271
Did carly heath put you up to this?

22:56.272 --> 22:57.606
No. Not at all.

22:57.607 --> 22:59.483
But if you want, I can talk to her.

22:59.484 --> 23:02.777
You think she would go for it?

23:02.778 --> 23:04.653
Honestly, I don't know.

23:04.654 --> 23:07.949
She's got this sort of
anti-establishment "fuck you" attitude.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.867
Conventional news bores her.

23:09.868 --> 23:13.455
But if you had something gritty to show... 

23:15.248 --> 23:17.626
I've got a story if you want it.

23:17.627 --> 23:19.169
It's pretty fucking great.

23:19.170 --> 23:20.878
You would give away a story?

23:20.879 --> 23:22.339
If you're not interested... 

23:22.340 --> 23:24.549
no, I'm interested.

23:27.302 --> 23:31.264
If I seem a little hung
over, it is because I am.

23:31.265 --> 23:33.558
A lot hung over, actually.

23:33.559 --> 23:36.186
God, I almost had a couple of months,

23:36.187 --> 23:39.230
and then last night, I... 

23:39.231 --> 23:42.567
Well, I don't remember much, so... 

23:42.568 --> 23:45.362
But anyway, here I am.

23:45.363 --> 23:46.821
Keep coming back.

23:46.822 --> 23:48.156
[Group] It works if you work it.

23:48.157 --> 23:50.699
Thank you for sharing, Diane.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.661
I'm Doug, and I'm an alcoholic.

23:52.662 --> 23:54.329
[Group] Hi, Doug.

23:56.623 --> 23:59.292
One of the things I do
for a living is count.

23:59.293 --> 24:00.669
I count votes.

24:00.670 --> 24:03.630
Yeas, nays, neutrals, abstaining.

24:03.631 --> 24:06.007
And I'm good at it.

24:06.008 --> 24:09.052
But the most important count I
do has nothing to do with work.

24:09.053 --> 24:13.473
It's the number of days
since April 4, 1999.

24:13.474 --> 24:16.518
As of this morning, that's 5,185.

24:16.519 --> 24:20.771
The bigger that number gets,
the more it frightens me,

24:20.772 --> 24:23.650
because I know all it takes is
one drink to go back to zero.

24:23.651 --> 24:28.321
Most people see fear as
a weakness. It can be.

24:28.322 --> 24:32.450
Sometimes for my job, I have
to put fear in other people.

24:32.451 --> 24:34.369
I know that's not right.

24:34.370 --> 24:37.664
But if I'm honest, like the
fourth step asks us to be,

24:37.665 --> 24:39.708
I have to be ruthless,

24:39.709 --> 24:42.835
because failure is not an option.

24:42.836 --> 24:44.837
The same goes for my sobriety.

24:44.838 --> 24:47.674
I have to be ruthless with myself.

24:47.675 --> 24:49.676
I have to use my fear.

24:49.677 --> 24:51.428
It makes me stronger.

24:51.429 --> 24:54.723
Like everyone in this room,
I can't control who I am.

24:54.724 --> 24:56.974
But I can control the zero.

24:56.975 --> 24:59.768
Fuck the zero.

24:59.769 --> 25:02.480
[Group] Thanks for sharing.

25:02.481 --> 25:04.649
It works if you work it.

25:04.650 --> 25:07.235
[Woman] Who would like to share next?

25:07.236 --> 25:09.487
- Was he at the meeting?
- [Stamper] He was.

25:09.488 --> 25:10.947
I tried to find him afterwards,

25:10.948 --> 25:13.032
but he was gone before I
could catch up with him.

25:13.033 --> 25:16.369
- Did he say anything?
- No. He never shares. He looked preoccupied.

25:16.370 --> 25:19.330
- You think he'll show up at the house today?
- I have no idea.

25:19.331 --> 25:20.915
He's not answering my calls.

25:20.916 --> 25:24.335
Mine neither. Anything else I need to know?

25:25.545 --> 25:27.589
I hear silence. I don't like that sound.

25:27.590 --> 25:29.758
Something came up. I'm handling it.

25:29.759 --> 25:32.260
- Something serious?
- Serious but solvable.

25:32.261 --> 25:35.472
- Do I wanna know more?
- I don't think you do. We'll be okay.

25:35.473 --> 25:38.308
I might have to involve Nancy.
I'm hoping I won't have to.

25:38.309 --> 25:41.561
But if I do, she'll have no
knowledge of anything damaging.

25:41.562 --> 25:43.605
All right. Use your best judgment.

25:43.606 --> 25:45.523
Of course, sir.

25:45.524 --> 25:47.233
I've gotta go.

25:47.234 --> 25:48.859
Miss Gallagher?

25:48.860 --> 25:51.820
Can the congressman have a moment?

25:54.115 --> 25:56.825
Things are... they're complicated.

25:56.826 --> 25:59.370
I realize that, but he truly needs you.

25:59.371 --> 26:01.289
I don't know what I could say to him.

26:01.290 --> 26:03.458
I think just showing up
would do him a world of good.

26:03.459 --> 26:05.876
Today is tough. The speaker
has a full schedule... 

26:05.877 --> 26:07.920
look, I already spoke to
Bob, and he said he'd be fine

26:07.921 --> 26:09.589
if you took the rest of the day off.

26:09.590 --> 26:11.800
In fact, he said he'd be
fine if you wanted to take

26:11.801 --> 26:14.302
- the next six months off.
- What?

26:14.303 --> 26:16.554
I want you to be deputy campaign manager.

26:16.555 --> 26:18.889
You work under Nash Aarons.

26:25.021 --> 26:29.025
No. I spent years being Peter's
crutch. If you just want me there... 

26:29.026 --> 26:31.944
well, of course we want you there
to help, but not as a crutch.

26:31.945 --> 26:35.365
Peter is a talented young
man with a lot of potential.

26:35.366 --> 26:37.033
He knows this,

26:37.034 --> 26:39.577
but he needs to hear it
from someone other than me.

26:39.578 --> 26:41.663
Someone he truly cares about.

26:43.206 --> 26:45.667
I'm sorry. This is just a lot right now.

26:45.668 --> 26:47.210
Well, you don't have
to make a decision now,

26:47.211 --> 26:48.712

40:42.339 --> 40:44.089
Ever while you were in public office?

40:44.090 --> 40:46.467
No. Never. My chief problem was alcohol.

40:46.468 --> 40:50.971
And you've been sober how long now?

40:50.972 --> 40:54.016
- A little over a year.
- And what made you want to get sober?

40:55.601 --> 40:58.646
Two things. My children,

40:58.647 --> 41:02.191
whom I love more than
anything else in the world,

41:02.192 --> 41:04.318
and my renewed faith in God.

41:13.035 --> 41:15.663
[Salsa music blaring]

41:20.834 --> 41:22.419
Zoe.

41:23.337 --> 41:24.921
Lucas.

41:24.922 --> 41:30.093
I was just in the
neighborhood, and I thought... 

41:30.094 --> 41:33.889
No. That's a lie. I was at
the bar around the corner.

41:33.890 --> 41:35.891
The one with the, uh... 

41:35.892 --> 41:38.185
and I remembered that time

41:38.186 --> 41:40.604
that I dropped you off after work.

41:40.605 --> 41:43.023
I knew it was... 

41:43.024 --> 41:44.774
This block.

41:44.775 --> 41:46.818
[Stammers, clears throat]

41:46.819 --> 41:50.072
And I, uh, buzzed, and then I waited... 

41:50.073 --> 41:52.700
- you're wasted.
- I'm pretty wasted.

42:05.128 --> 42:10.133
Do you wanna know a deep, dark secret?

42:22.145 --> 42:26.942
Now we don't work together... 

42:28.694 --> 42:30.738
Anymore.

42:46.211 --> 42:48.380
Lucas... 

42:48.381 --> 42:50.758
I'm really flattered.

42:51.925 --> 42:53.969
But I'm just not in a place

42:53.970 --> 42:58.140
where I'm even thinking
romantically right now.

43:01.977 --> 43:05.522
I'm sorry. I, uh... 

43:07.316 --> 43:09.401
Yeah.

43:12.279 --> 43:14.281
Hey, hey!

43:14.282 --> 43:16.032
[Taps]

43:21.413 --> 43:22.914
[Door closes]

43:38.263 --> 43:40.766
You want me to pull up now, sir?

43:46.605 --> 43:48.649
[Knock on door]

43:54.112 --> 43:55.947
[Knock]

43:56.865 --> 43:58.450
[Door opens]

43:59.368 --> 44:01.077
[Door closes]

44:09.336 --> 44:11.421
I still have my key.

44:49.251 --> 44:52.087
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need anything.

44:52.088 --> 44:54.172
Thank you.

45:04.683 --> 45:06.810
[Salsa music blaring]

45:13.609 --> 45:15.318
[Buzzes]

45:16.361 --> 45:18.363
[Buzzing]

45:18.364 --> 45:21.909
[Baby crying, soft rock music playing]

45:24.620 --> 45:26.789
[Utensils clinking]

45:30.834 --> 45:34.296
Hey, I got us wine, but I
can't find a corkscrew anywhere.

45:34.297 --> 45:36.506
Give it to me.

45:37.424 --> 45:39.509
I need a pen.

45:41.720 --> 45:44.514
- The pen the President gave you?
- That'll work.

45:49.352 --> 45:52.940
[Sirens wailing, distant]

45:55.066 --> 45:56.276
[Grunts]

45:56.277 --> 45:57.861
Did you talk to Ms. Skorsky?

45:57.862 --> 46:00.948
I did. She said it was intense.

46:00.949 --> 46:03.408
I think Carly's gonna
offer her a job at Slugline.

46:03.409 --> 46:06.244
- Was that your doing?
- Janine expressed interest.

46:06.245 --> 46:08.497
I took the next step.

46:08.498 --> 46:12.125
Well done. Always good to be owed favors.

46:13.752 --> 46:17.130
I was wondering. Do you
ever think about my age?

46:17.131 --> 46:19.508
No. Does my age bother you?

46:19.509 --> 46:22.845
You must have other lovers...
men that are younger than me.

46:22.846 --> 46:24.638
- No.
- Not that I would mind.

46:24.639 --> 46:26.932
I am married, after all.

46:26.933 --> 46:30.769
I don't have time for other lovers.

46:30.770 --> 46:32.437
Mm.

46:35.022 --> 46:36.608
Mm. Shit.

46:36.609 --> 46:38.902
It's turned. Give me that.

46:38.903 --> 46:40.278
Mm.

46:53.876 --> 46:57.212
[Chuckles] You could've just stepped on it.

46:57.213 --> 47:01.967
I have asked the super to get an
exterminator in here, and he won't do it.

47:01.968 --> 47:04.302
So anytime I see a cockroach
or a spider, or whatever,

47:04.303 --> 47:07.222
I try and trap it, and
then I leave it by his door.

47:07.223 --> 47:08.348
You really ought to get your parents

47:08.349 --> 47:10.017
to let you borrow some money.

47:10.018 --> 47:11.977
Then you wouldn't have to
live in the third world.

47:11.978 --> 47:14.021
I would never take money from them.

47:14.022 --> 47:16.899
Because they don't have it,
or because you don't want it.

47:16.900 --> 47:19.026
Because I don't want it.

47:19.027 --> 47:21.236
It's father's day, you know.

47:21.237 --> 47:22.779
It is?

47:22.780 --> 47:24.364
You should call your father.

47:24.365 --> 47:26.324
I'll call him tomorrow.

47:26.325 --> 47:28.827
Tomorrow you'll be the daughter
that forgot father's day

47:28.828 --> 47:31.246
instead of the one who remembered.

47:31.247 --> 47:33.790
Go ahead. Call him.

47:39.546 --> 47:41.715
[Automatic dialing]

47:43.800 --> 47:47.178
Hey, dad. Sorry it's so late.

47:47.179 --> 47:49.932
'Cause you weren't home
the last time I called her.

47:49.933 --> 47:53.852
There's so little she'll
ever reveal to me or I to her.

47:53.853 --> 47:55.854
I bet her father knows even less.

47:55.855 --> 47:58.690
I'm sure she's speaking
half an octave higher.

47:58.691 --> 48:00.901
Same voice she had when she was 16.

48:00.902 --> 48:02.903
Telling him all about her new job,

48:02.904 --> 48:04.153
how much she misses him,

48:04.154 --> 48:06.364
and sorry she didn't send a card.

48:06.365 --> 48:09.200
Telling him everything but the truth.

48:09.201 --> 48:12.454
Just like she wouldn't tell me
about that young man downstairs.

48:12.455 --> 48:13.956
I'm calling now, all right?

48:13.957 --> 48:15.665
Don't make me feel bad about it.

48:15.666 --> 48:18.376
It was the best thing
that could've happened.

48:18.377 --> 48:20.211
I didn't fit in there.

48:20.212 --> 48:22.881
I've been called worse, dad.

48:22.882 --> 48:25.341
There's a value in having secrets.

48:25.342 --> 48:28.303
Creatures like myself,
like Claire, like Zoe... 

48:28.304 --> 48:30.472
we wouldn't be ourselves without them.

48:30.473 --> 48:32.474
But Peter Russo, on the other hand... 

48:32.475 --> 48:34.643
he's trapped by his secrets.

48:34.644 --> 48:36.895
What I'm trying to do is
give him the opportunity

48:36.896 --> 48:38.313
to set himself free.

48:38.314 --> 48:39.856
I don't know.

48:42.358 --> 48:44.151
I don't know yet.

48:44.152 --> 48:46.571
After all, we are nothing more or less

48:46.572 --> 48:48.364
than what we choose to reveal.

48:48.365 --> 48:50.784
What I am to Claire is
not what I am to Zoe,

48:50.785 --> 48:53.620
just as Zoe is not to me
what she is to her father.

48:58.750 --> 49:01.128
Probably Thanksgiving.

49:03.922 --> 49:07.634
'Cause I don't think I can
make it back before then.

49:15.725 --> 49:17.393
[Chuckles]

49:17.394 --> 49:19.354
Okay. I'll try.

49:22.607 --> 49:24.442
I said I'll try.

49:24.443 --> 49:28.822
For Christmas. Uh... no.

49:31.533 --> 49:33.035
Mm-mm.

49:35.202 --> 49:38.957
No. I'm not seeing anyone right now.

49:38.958 --> 49:40.792
I don't feel like it.

49:43.962 --> 49:46.464
Because I'm not interested in that.

49:48.967 --> 49:51.845
I would tell you, dad. Uh-huh.

49:51.846 --> 49:53.889
Yeah.

49:56.933 --> 49:59.310
Okay.

50:01.479 --> 50:03.314
Don't be worried about me.

50:03.315 --> 50:05.067
I'm fine.

50:06.068 --> 50:07.652
Yeah.

50:08.653 --> 50:11.698
Dad, I'm in... 

50:11.699 --> 50:14.283
I'm in a really great place right now.

50:20.247 --> 50:21.499
[Gasps]

50:22.375 --> 50:24.251
I'm gonna try.

50:25.212 --> 50:26.379
[Gasps]

50:26.380 --> 50:28.048
I'm gonna try to come, okay?

50:28.049 --> 50:30.217

Aren't you gonna wish
me a happy Father's Day?

50:56.534 --> 50:58.745
You don't have any children.
