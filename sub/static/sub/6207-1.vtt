35:58.378 --> 36:00.579
I'm sorry.

36:00.713 --> 36:02.492
I can't.

36:05.927 --> 36:09.157
But I can give you the next best thing.

36:12.225 --> 36:14.948
God did this to you, Nick...

36:16.187 --> 36:18.099
and I can give you justice.

36:19.733 --> 36:21.560
Peace.

36:22.902 --> 36:25.661
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

36:25.780 --> 36:27.898
Because, contrary to popular belief...

36:28.950 --> 36:30.983
I don't lie.

36:31.995 --> 36:34.329
I don't need to.

36:35.999 --> 36:38.031
What I need...

36:38.918 --> 36:40.104
is you.

36:44.340 --> 36:46.337
Nick, I need you to say "yes."

36:59.898 --> 37:02.184
Then yes.

37:19.292 --> 37:21.155
<i>BOBBY:
"Unlikely to walk again"?</i>

37:21.294 --> 37:23.666
Why, you snot-nosed son of a bitch.

37:23.797 --> 37:26.168
Wait till I get out of this bed.

37:26.299 --> 37:29.735
I'll use my game leg
and kick your frigging ass!

37:29.844 --> 37:31.417
Yeah, you'd better run!

37:32.639 --> 37:35.869
- You believe that yahoo?
- Screw him. You'll be fine.

37:37.727 --> 37:39.760
So let me ask
the million-dollar question.

37:41.481 --> 37:43.477
What do we do now?

37:44.150 --> 37:45.723
Well...

37:46.027 --> 37:49.003
we save as many as we can
for as long as we can, I guess.

37:49.572 --> 37:51.060
It's bad.

37:51.533 --> 37:53.106
Whoever wins, heaven or hell...

37:53.243 --> 37:54.852
- we're boned.
- What if we win?

37:54.994 --> 37:56.216
I'm serious.

37:56.871 --> 38:00.101
Screw the angels and the demons
and their crap Apocalypse.

38:00.208 --> 38:04.032
You know, they wanna fight a war,
they can find their own planet.

38:04.129 --> 38:07.275
This one's ours,
and I say they get the hell off it.

38:07.382 --> 38:10.564
We take them all on. We kill the devil,
Michael if we have to...

38:10.677 --> 38:13.181
but we do it our own damn selves.

38:13.555 --> 38:15.926
And how are we
supposed to do all this, genius?

38:16.391 --> 38:17.661
I got no idea.

38:18.810 --> 38:22.464
But what I do have is a GED
and a give-them-hell attitude...

38:22.564 --> 38:23.834
and I'll figure it out.

38:27.068 --> 38:29.149
You are nine kinds of crazy, boy.

38:30.739 --> 38:32.686
It's been said.

38:33.408 --> 38:35.827
Listen, you stay on the mend.

38:35.952 --> 38:37.561
We'll see you in a bit.

38:39.581 --> 38:41.238
<i>BOBBY:
Sam?</i>

38:43.334 --> 38:45.162
I was awake.

38:47.005 --> 38:49.594
I know what I said back there.

38:50.675 --> 38:55.515
I just want you to know that
that was the demon talking.

38:59.726 --> 39:02.956
I ain't cutting you out, boy. Not ever.

39:09.152 --> 39:10.253
Thanks, Bobby.

39:11.237 --> 39:12.423
You're welcome.

39:13.364 --> 39:17.660
I deserve a damn medal for this,
but you're welcome.

39:27.921 --> 39:31.490
<i>SAM: You know, I was thinking, Dean,
maybe we could go after the Colt.</i>

39:31.591 --> 39:34.398
- What difference would that make?
- Use it on Lucifer.

39:34.511 --> 39:38.419
- I mean, you just said back there...
- I said a bunch of crap for Bobby.

39:39.391 --> 39:42.233
I mean, I'll fight.

39:42.727 --> 39:45.486
I'll fight till the last man,
but let's be honest.

39:45.605 --> 39:49.041
I mean, we don't stand
a snowball's chance and you know that.

39:49.150 --> 39:51.522
I mean, hell,
you of all people know that.

39:51.653 --> 39:53.310
Dean.

39:58.076 --> 39:59.939
Is there something
you wanna say to me?

40:07.252 --> 40:09.538
I tried, Sammy.

40:10.505 --> 40:12.501
I mean, I really tried.

40:13.717 --> 40:16.947
But I just can't keep pretending
that everything's all right.

40:18.471 --> 40:20.504
Because it's not...

40:20.974 --> 40:22.462
and it's never going to be.

40:22.600 --> 40:25.746
You chose a demon
over your own brother...

40:25.854 --> 40:27.124
and look what happened.

40:27.272 --> 40:29.352
I would give anything...

40:29.482 --> 40:33.173
- anything to take it all back.
- I know you would.

40:34.946 --> 40:37.753
And I know how sorry you are, I do.

40:37.866 --> 40:39.729
But, man...

40:41.453 --> 40:44.077
you were the one
that I depended on the most...

40:45.415 --> 40:48.766
and you let me down
in ways that I can't even...

40:53.590 --> 40:58.901
I'm just... I'm having a hard time
forgiving and forgetting here, you know?

41:01.514 --> 41:02.917
What can I do?

41:05.643 --> 41:07.386
Honestly?

41:08.480 --> 41:09.531
Nothing.

41:12.317 --> 41:14.144
I just don't...

41:15.236 --> 41:19.786
I don't think that we can ever be
what we were, you know?

41:22.660 --> 41:24.657
I just don't think I can trust you.
