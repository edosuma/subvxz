that you're here

Andrew walk out on me.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.787
Yes.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.355
- I couldn't lie to him anymore.
- 'Oh.'

22:03.355 --> 22:05.457
- But you could lie to me?
- It was one time!

22:05.457 --> 22:08.294
- It doesn't make it right.
- You never cared about Nolan.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.662
Why do you care about this?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.063
I care about being lied to.

22:11.063 --> 22:12.898
[scoffs]
Says the one who outed Ava.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.601
You know what, can you all just
shut up so we can do this?

22:15.601 --> 22:17.736
I don't blame him
for leaving you.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.175
When he's not looking
put three of these in his drink.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.410
He should be telling you
his whole life story

22:24.410 --> 22:25.911
within the hour.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.513
And is that when we come in
and beat the shit out of him?

22:27.513 --> 22:31.150
No, that's when Caitlin dazzles
him with her winning personality

22:31.150 --> 22:35.087
and makes him feel safe.
Like he can tell her the truth.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.423
And then we come in,
take the camera.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.425
[instrumental music]

22:39.425 --> 22:42.094
Come on, Dylan, he'll see that
the second he walks in.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.129
Yeah, well, who died
and made you boss, Ava?

22:44.129 --> 22:46.765
- Nolan.
- Are we sure we wanna do this?

22:46.765 --> 22:49.435
Don't you dare, Caitlin!

22:49.435 --> 22:51.837
We can't do this without you
and you owe me.

22:51.837 --> 22:54.039
I made a mistake..

22:54.039 --> 22:55.774
...and I’m sorry
that it hurt you, but--

22:55.774 --> 22:57.543
You said you're willing
to do whatever it takes

22:57.543 --> 22:58.911
to take your life back.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.213
Whatever it takes
to stop Nolan 2.0.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.382
Whatever it takes to prove to me
that you're sorry.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.551
Yes! I did,
but we're about to break

23:05.551 --> 23:07.553
a lot of laws here!
Felonies!

23:07.553 --> 23:09.922
Maybe that comes
easy to you, though.

23:09.922 --> 23:12.057
You know, runs in the family.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.661
Screw you.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.333
- Ava, I'm sorry.
- Don't waste your breath.

23:21.333 --> 23:24.236
Let's just stop fighting and
focus on what we're doing here.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.071
I need things to go back
to the way they were.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.441
Same, I came to BHU
to be laser-focused.

23:29.441 --> 23:33.045
I can't nail my audition tonight
with this hanging over my head.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.581
[dramatic music]

23:37.983 --> 23:39.585
We're set.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.521
So this is how it's gonna be?

23:42.521 --> 23:43.923
After tonight,
we're just gonna move on

23:43.923 --> 23:46.191
like we're no longer friends?

23:46.191 --> 23:47.826
We were never friends.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.730
[music continues]

23:52.998 --> 23:55.734
[coffee machine whirring]

24:03.142 --> 24:05.210
Hello, Mona.

24:05.210 --> 24:06.979
Hello!

24:06.979 --> 24:11.250
- Mind if I sit down?
- Oh, please, be my guest.

24:11.250 --> 24:14.253
I wanted to get your opinion
on something.

24:14.253 --> 24:16.889
Yes, you could use a makeover.

24:16.889 --> 24:20.025
- About your friend Alison.
- Hmm?

24:20.025 --> 24:21.660
I'm sure you know
she's protecting

24:21.660 --> 24:23.829
Dylan, Ava and Caitlin.

24:23.829 --> 24:26.265
Why do you think
she's doing that?

24:26.265 --> 24:27.900
Those three looked like
they needed help.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.537
- She's very nurturing.
- But why those three?

24:31.537 --> 24:33.572
- No idea.
- Really?

24:33.572 --> 24:36.141
- You don't see a pattern?
- Of?

24:36.141 --> 24:37.843
Isn't this what happened
in Rosewood

24:37.843 --> 24:39.345
when she was in high school?

24:39.345 --> 24:42.147
The way she formed a tight group
of people around her?

24:42.147 --> 24:44.650
People who were dependent
on her?

24:44.650 --> 24:47.853
That's not a pattern.
That's ancient history.

24:47.853 --> 24:51.156
I think it says a great deal
about the kind of person she is.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.092
That she needs people
to be committed to her

24:53.092 --> 24:56.895
indebted to her. Nolan Hotchkiss
had this little group of his.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.497
Ready-made posse,
now he's gone

24:58.497 --> 25:02.034
and Alison seems to have
grafted them on to herself.

25:02.034 --> 25:05.871
Ali is a very complex person.
It's part of her charm.

25:05.871 --> 25:08.140
- Part of yours too.
- Huh?

25:08.140 --> 25:10.576
I noticed in your file
you never told the university

25:10.576 --> 25:12.845
what happened
on Rue de Ciphler.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.246
Am I saying that right?

25:14.246 --> 25:17.249
- My French isn't very good.
- No, it's not.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.752
And no, I didn’t tell ’em,
it’s not relevant.

25:19.752 --> 25:23.055
I see...so tell me,
do you worry

25:23.055 --> 25:26.558
that Alex and Mary Drake
may try to find you?

25:28.160 --> 25:29.561
[chuckles]

25:29.561 --> 25:32.498
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:32.498 --> 25:35.701
Oh! But isn't that
what got you in trouble

25:35.701 --> 25:38.070
with the FBI in the first place?

25:38.070 --> 25:41.039
Making connections
that aren't there.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.742
Letting an obsession with the
Jalali case cloud your judgement

25:43.742 --> 25:47.746
leading you to take shortcuts?
Illegal ones.

25:47.746 --> 25:50.349
That's what got you fired
...isn't it?

25:50.349 --> 25:52.184
[instrumental music]

25:53.819 --> 25:57.156
It's a funny thing about
research, it goes both ways.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.159
Excuse me?

26:00.159 --> 26:01.860
The chess piece.

26:05.497 --> 26:06.832
Good luck charm?

26:06.832 --> 26:08.967
Everybody needs a white knight
sometime..

26:12.704 --> 26:14.840
...but today mine didn't show.

26:21.613 --> 26:23.715
[clicks switch]

26:23.715 --> 26:26.852
[instrumental music]

26:30.189 --> 26:33.926
You've, uh...really done a lot
with the place.

26:35.561 --> 26:37.563
I'm sorry, they..

26:37.563 --> 26:39.865
They redecorated
before I moved in.

26:40.799 --> 26:41.967
No.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.670
Don't be sorry.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.740
It's your home now.

26:52.711 --> 26:55.848
Are you sure
you don't wanna go see your mom?

26:55.848 --> 26:58.317
I don't think she'd ever try
and hurt you.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.885
No.

26:59.885 --> 27:04.656
I just need one night in a place
where I feel...safe.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.592
[music continues]

27:06.592 --> 27:08.227
Yeah.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.908
[dramatic music]

27:33.452 --> 27:34.720
Where is he?

27:34.720 --> 27:37.122
Yup. Thank you.

27:37.122 --> 27:39.791
So, I got them to push my
audition to last on the schedule

27:39.791 --> 27:42.528
but if I don't leave now
I'm not gonna make it.

27:43.762 --> 27:45.797
And you're sure
Mason knew it was tonight?

27:45.797 --> 27:48.233
Yeah, I'm sure,
and he's Mr. Punctual

27:48.233 --> 27:50.502
so he would never be
an hour late.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.204
[scoffs]
We got played.

27:52.204 --> 27:55.440
I wanted this more than anyone,
but...I say we call it.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.943
[music continues]

27:57.943 --> 28:00.846
Alright. Well, then,
you guys can go, I'll pack up.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.518
What does this mean
for the three of us?

28:06.518 --> 28:09.855
I don't think you can be friends
with people you can never trust.

28:10.622 --> 28:13.492
[door opens and shuts]

28:13.492 --> 28:16.028
[dramatic music]

28:18.564 --> 28:21.099
[door opens and shuts]

28:23.769 --> 28:25.904
[engine cranking]

28:30.576 --> 28:31.910
[phone beeps]

28:41.620 --> 28:44.156
[music continues]

29:07.145 --> 29:09.481
(male #1)
'What is your name?'

29:09.481 --> 29:10.882
Dylan Walker.

29:10.882 --> 29:12.851
(male #1)
What piece were you told
to play?

29:12.851 --> 29:16.588
[exhales]
Uh, the courante section of
Bach's First Cello Suite.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.494
[exhales]

29:42.080 --> 29:45.017
[plays cello]

29:47.019 --> 29:48.453
[exhales]

29:48.453 --> 29:51.590
[dramatic music]

29:57.229 --> 29:59.231
[clicking tongue]

30:05.837 --> 30:08.974
(male #1)
Mr. Walker,
is there a problem?

30:19.685 --> 30:21.586
[exhaling]

30:31.763 --> 30:34.900
[plays cello]

31:04.730 --> 31:07.866

31:31.490 --> 31:33.625
[inhales sharply]

31:39.364 --> 31:40.832
(male #1)
Next!

31:42.634 --> 31:45.771
[dramatic music]

31:49.474 --> 31:52.611
[car approaching]

31:56.948 --> 31:59.618
[car door opens and shuts]

32:02.687 --> 32:04.156
[door opens]

32:05.724 --> 32:07.425
- Hi.
- Hope you're hungry.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.494
I stopped at your favorite
Italian place.

32:09.494 --> 32:13.799
Oh, well, that's perfect because
I got you your favorite whiskey.

32:13.799 --> 32:16.268
Oh.. Cate..

32:18.537 --> 32:20.172
You know, I made a pact
with the rest of the team

32:20.172 --> 32:22.641
to not drink
until Crew season's over.

32:24.576 --> 32:27.612
Uh...I just thought
since it's you and me

32:27.612 --> 32:29.181
I mean, no one's gonna know.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.550
Oh, are you asking me
to lie?

32:31.550 --> 32:33.351
No.

32:33.351 --> 32:35.353
Who knew you were
so naughty.

32:37.923 --> 32:39.424
I thought you did.

32:39.424 --> 32:42.093
And I thought I was gonna have
to deal with Jeremy.

32:42.093 --> 32:46.097
But, uh, guess you took care
of that, didn't you?

32:46.097 --> 32:47.732
Is it a little chilly in here?

32:47.732 --> 32:50.302
I saw some firewood in front,
I'll go grab it.

32:50.302 --> 32:54.573
And then you and I...can
warm this place up together.

32:54.573 --> 32:55.607
Mm-hmm.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.008
[clears throat]

32:57.008 --> 32:58.677
[softly chuckles]

33:00.745 --> 33:02.614
[dramatic music]

33:04.149 --> 33:06.885
Hi. Can I get one pumpkin spice
latte please?

33:06.885 --> 33:08.119
Thanks.

33:14.125 --> 33:16.261
Hey.

33:16.261 --> 33:17.462
How'd it go?

33:17.462 --> 33:19.130
Honestly, I don't..

33:19.130 --> 33:20.632
I don't really know.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.167
I'm sure you killed it.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.903
Look, about what I said
in the cabin earlier..

33:24.903 --> 33:26.538
Same.

33:30.041 --> 33:31.743
Goodbye, Dylan.

33:31.743 --> 33:35.080
W-wait, you say that like I'm,
I'm never gonna see you again.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.582
I'm still gonna come
to your fashion show.

33:37.582 --> 33:41.019
I made you a promise, alright.
I'm-I'm gonna stick to that.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.292
[indistinct chatter]

33:52.631 --> 33:54.132
I understand.

33:56.034 --> 34:00.071
- About you and Nolan.
- What?

34:00.071 --> 34:02.941
Nolan didn't have many ways of
expressing himself

34:02.941 --> 34:05.477
but he was always really good
at passion.

34:05.477 --> 34:06.578
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.680
And sometimes it seemed
that was the only way

34:08.680 --> 34:11.016
he could show you how he felt.

34:11.016 --> 34:12.984
'How he truly felt.'

34:14.052 --> 34:16.187
And sometimes
that passion was..

34:17.022 --> 34:19.257
...was overpowering.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.393
And impossible
to turn away from.

34:24.462 --> 34:27.465
Maybe that's how you can
explain it to Andrew.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.402
Thank you.

34:36.141 --> 34:39.611
You know, we might decide
we never wanna leave this place.

34:39.611 --> 34:42.280
I like the idea of keeping you
all to myself.

34:44.549 --> 34:46.151
Alright.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.355
I can't have you
being cold.

34:50.355 --> 34:51.523
[grunts]

34:52.691 --> 34:55.627
[intense music]

35:06.404 --> 35:09.040
[dramatic music]

35:23.788 --> 35:26.091
[crickets chirping]

35:40.105 --> 35:41.740
Daddy?

35:47.712 --> 35:49.014
Hello, Ava.

35:49.014 --> 35:51.516
What a surprise
running into you like this.

35:51.516 --> 35:53.485
You are a miserable
human being.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.286
Why? Because I read your file?

35:55.286 --> 35:58.289
Because I know your dad called
you his beautiful dreamer?

35:58.289 --> 36:00.492
Because I know
your favorite lullaby?

36:00.492 --> 36:02.661
That's the beauty of
not wearing the badge anymore.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.530
I can play the games
however I want.

36:05.530 --> 36:08.867
Now, can I have a look
in that bag?

36:08.867 --> 36:12.370
Or maybe we can work something
out between the two of us?

36:12.370 --> 36:14.906
You keep the bag and tell me
which of your friends

36:14.906 --> 36:18.343
killed Nolan Hotchkiss?
Or was it your teacher?

36:21.046 --> 36:24.182
[dramatic music]

36:26.885 --> 36:28.219
[unzips bag]

36:31.389 --> 36:33.525
[intense music]

36:35.460 --> 36:37.162
What'd you think you were gonna
find in there, Dana?

36:37.162 --> 36:38.830
A severed hand?

36:41.299 --> 36:43.501
I'm not that easy to fool.

36:43.501 --> 36:45.904
Then why did you come here?

36:45.904 --> 36:48.006
Because you thought
that they came back for you?

36:48.006 --> 36:50.675
- Isn't that right?
- Are you done with that?

36:54.512 --> 36:56.548
Offer's still good.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.516
You tell me
who killed Nolan..

36:58.516 --> 36:59.851
...you can forget
all about the past.

36:59.851 --> 37:02.387
But you don't want to
forget the past.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.190
You want to bury it
along with my family..

37:05.190 --> 37:07.325
...and I'm not gonna let you
do that.

37:08.993 --> 37:11.029
(Dana)
'I might have it wrong.'

37:11.029 --> 37:14.632
Maybe Nolan found out about
the money and you killed him.

37:14.632 --> 37:15.900
[chuckles]

37:17.469 --> 37:18.970
Why don't you stay out here
for a couple of hours

37:18.970 --> 37:22.674
and think about that?
Hey! Maybe a bear will eat you.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.077
[wolf howling]

37:26.077 --> 37:28.980
Okay, I get that he said it was
dangerous for Taylor to be here

37:28.980 --> 37:31.483
but why are we trusting a crazy
guy who lives in the basement?

37:31.483 --> 37:33.752
Because I believed him.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.653
How long has he even been
living down there?

37:35.653 --> 37:38.389
Long enough to hear and see
an awful lot about this place.

37:38.389 --> 37:40.725
Ali, he's the one who wrote
the message on the wall!

37:40.725 --> 37:42.427
- "They're watching."
- Yes!

37:42.427 --> 37:45.096
He was trying to warn her,
Ali, you need to wake her up

37:45.096 --> 37:46.498
and get her out of town.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.299
You said it yourself,
this isn't Rosewood.

37:48.299 --> 37:53.138
No, but it might be just as bad
in its own uniquely creepy way.

37:53.138 --> 37:55.273
[dramatic music]

37:56.908 --> 37:59.144
[sighs]
I convinced her
to come back here.

37:59.144 --> 38:00.378
What am I supposed to tell her?

38:00.378 --> 38:02.447
That you made a mistake.
Go.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.321
(Alison)
'Taylor? Taylor?'

38:11.256 --> 38:13.458
- She's gone!
- What!

38:13.458 --> 38:14.826
Okay, when you say gone,
what do you--

38:14.826 --> 38:18.129
Missing, Mona!
She's not where I left her!

38:18.129 --> 38:19.764
Ali..

38:21.766 --> 38:24.702
[dramatic music]

38:26.604 --> 38:27.872
[sniffles]

38:29.741 --> 38:31.209
[sighs]

38:54.799 --> 38:57.068
[music continues]

38:57.068 --> 38:58.403
[phone beeps]

39:03.708 --> 39:06.744
(Caitlin on voicemail)
'Ava, it's me,
and you were wrong.'

39:06.744 --> 39:08.213
'You can trust me.'

39:08.213 --> 39:10.615
'Look, I've got Mason's phone
and I don't wanna bring it'

39:10.615 --> 39:12.884
'to campus, so meet me
at the Old Road. Okay?'

39:12.884 --> 39:15.553
'I called Dylan,
he's on his way.'

39:18.156 --> 39:20.291
[car approaching]

39:26.898 --> 39:28.233
Got the phone?

39:29.234 --> 39:31.870
- Yeah.
- Oh, there she is.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.176
[engine accelerating]

39:38.176 --> 39:39.644
Ava?

39:39.644 --> 39:40.912
Caitlin!

39:40.912 --> 39:43.681
[intense music]

39:45.350 --> 39:47.485
[tires screeching]

39:48.686 --> 39:50.955
[sighs]
Jesus.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.904
Caitlin?
Oh, my God. Caitlin!

40:05.904 --> 40:07.972
- Yeah, she's breathing, I--
- Caitlin!

40:07.972 --> 40:09.507
I don't know
about 45 seconds per minute.

40:09.507 --> 40:11.042
- She got hit by a car.
- Oh, my God.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.877
Can you just.. Can you send
someone? We're on the Old Road?

40:12.877 --> 40:15.113
- Help!
- Please as soon as--

40:15.113 --> 40:16.848
Somebody help!

40:16.848 --> 40:19.484
- What happened?
- She got hit by a car.

40:19.484 --> 40:21.419
- Somebody help!
- On the Old Road--

40:21.419 --> 40:22.887
We're on the Old Road.
Caitlin?

40:22.887 --> 40:24.789
Please help me.

40:24.789 --> 40:26.291
Oh, my God.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.592
'Caitlin?'

40:27.592 --> 40:29.360
[Ava breathing heavily]

40:29.360 --> 40:30.628
[music continues]

40:31.729 --> 40:34.399
[theme music]
