This is Kang Kwon Joo at
the Poongsan Golden Time Team.

01:11.450 --> 01:14.080
My daughter left this morning
to go to school.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.630
<i>She texted me that
the scumbag kidnapped her.</i>

01:17.630 --> 01:22.610
We checked her location through an app,
and her cell phone was near his house...

01:22.610 --> 01:27.000
<i>And my husband took a knife
and ran to that scumbag's house.</i>

01:27.000 --> 01:30.010
Scumbag? Can you please explain?

01:34.200 --> 01:36.620
The caller's name is Oh Soon Im. Age 45.

01:36.620 --> 01:39.970
She runs a fish shop at Poongsan Fish
Market with her husband, Hwang Ki Hyuk.

01:39.970 --> 01:43.620
They have a daughter, Hee Joo, 18.
And a son, Ji Wook, 7.

01:45.180 --> 01:49.390
Director Kang, Hee Joo's
a victim of child rape.

01:49.390 --> 01:51.600
The offender was released a month ago.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.940
After passing the teaching exam,
he got drunk and raped the child.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.280
Being that it was his first offense,
and it was six years ago

01:57.280 --> 01:59.500
he must have gotten off easy.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.250
Hee Joo is a victim of child rape,
registered for police protection.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.640
<i>Is that right?</i>

02:07.810 --> 02:10.820
I'm sure they're hiding something.

02:10.820 --> 02:14.060
Yes, she is a victim of child rape.

02:14.860 --> 02:17.440
Oh my goodness, child rape?

02:17.440 --> 02:22.480
So please find our Hee Joo for us.
And please find my husband, too.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.770
Director, we've located
Hee Joo's last cell phone signal.

02:25.770 --> 02:30.030
4-45 Hope Villa in Hwai-dong,
near Yum Gi Tae's residence.

02:30.030 --> 02:31.680
The phone is turned off.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.100
See where she went after leaving home,
and check the CCTV by Yum Gi Tae's home.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.960
And track his anklet
to see where he was this morning.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.460
Yes, Ma'am.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.330
This is a code zero situation.

02:41.330 --> 02:43.530
Caller's name is Oh Soo Nim. Age 45.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.200
Her daughter, Hwang Hee Joo,
was raped six years ago.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.270
Believing the offender kidnapped her,
she says her husband, Hwang Ki Hyuk

02:49.270 --> 02:52.030
went to the offender
Yum Gi Tae's home with a knife.

02:52.030 --> 02:54.980
Hwang Hee Joo's phone
was last located near Yum Gi Tae's home.

02:54.980 --> 02:56.300
This may be his revenge.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.750
Detective Park, please go to
3-45 Hope Villa, Hwai Street, Hwadong-gu

02:59.750 --> 03:01.410
Yum Gi Tae's residence.

03:01.410 --> 03:04.510
Detective Koo, please go to Gyeyoung
Station and the Poongsan Fish Market.

03:04.510 --> 03:06.690
Yes, we're heading over.

03:06.690 --> 03:09.820
In case of emergency, Hwai Station,
please have a backup team.

03:09.820 --> 03:13.910
All officers, please wear bulletproof
vests and gloves, and stay safe.

03:13.910 --> 03:16.060
Send out an alert
for the code zero situation.

03:16.060 --> 03:17.400
Yes.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.690
The court has control
over the tracking of GPS anklets

03:20.690 --> 03:22.960
- so it may take some time.
- Do it ASAP.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.370
Ma'am, anything we should know
about following the offender's release?

03:26.370 --> 03:31.150
<i>Actually, he came
to our store a few days ago.</i>

03:31.150 --> 03:34.150
- Pardon?
- I was going to the freezer in the back.

03:34.150 --> 03:37.550
<i>And I saw someone looking
into our store from the back door.</i>

03:37.550 --> 03:40.540
- Who are you?
- He was wearing muddy shoes.

03:40.740 --> 03:42.930
Honey! Honey!

03:42.930 --> 03:44.690
Honey!

03:46.100 --> 03:49.700
Mister, I came to ask Hee Joo
for her forgiveness.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.950
I've done her wrong.

03:51.950 --> 03:54.690
You bastard, how dare you come here?

03:57.740 --> 04:02.050
What are you up to now?
How dare you!

04:02.050 --> 04:03.320
No!

04:03.320 --> 04:05.450
No...

04:05.450 --> 04:07.620
Honey, don't!
You better leave now!

04:07.620 --> 04:10.290
If you come back, I'll kill you.

04:10.290 --> 04:13.010
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

04:13.010 --> 04:14.900
I'm sorry.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.000
How dare he come here...

04:19.420 --> 04:21.500
Come on, call the cops!

04:21.500 --> 04:25.040
<i>And that night, Hee Joo...</i>

04:31.640 --> 04:34.270
Hee Joo, what are you doing?

04:34.270 --> 04:35.830
Honey! What are you doing?

04:35.830 --> 04:39.840
- Let go!
- Hee Joo...

04:39.840 --> 04:44.070
- This way, he won't recognize me.
- What do you mean?

04:44.070 --> 04:49.010
He was waiting for me
by our school.

04:49.010 --> 04:52.890
He was hiding behind the entrance,
and he was staring at me!

04:52.890 --> 04:56.080
- What?
- That damn bastard.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.290
This is all your fault!

05:12.290 --> 05:15.570
You said you would make sure
he never comes out!

05:15.570 --> 05:21.800
I'll go crazy knowing that he's back out!

05:25.040 --> 05:26.630
Get out!

05:26.630 --> 05:31.180
I can't stand the sight of you! Get out!

05:31.180 --> 05:32.870
Get out!

05:35.120 --> 05:37.560
Close the door.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.910
<i>My husband believed
he had come back to get revenge.</i>

05:40.910 --> 05:43.300
<i>We went to the police to ask for help</i>

05:43.300 --> 05:46.200
but they just gave us a little watch
kind of thing, and told us to wait.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.580
And this happened!

05:50.580 --> 05:54.110
<i>Please, save Hee Joo and my husband.</i>

05:54.110 --> 05:57.270
It's been verified Hwang Ki Hyuk
entered Yum Gi Tae's house a minute ago.

05:57.270 --> 06:01.400
But it looks like Yum Gi Tae hasn't
come out of his house since last night.

06:02.790 --> 06:07.380
<i>- The evil...
- Hold on.</i>

06:07.380 --> 06:17.590
<i>like the burdens of a cross,
hardships of a life...</i>

06:17.590 --> 06:22.230
<i>My only wish...</i>

06:22.230 --> 06:23.990
You bastard!

06:23.990 --> 06:25.610
Hee Joo!

06:25.610 --> 06:27.310
Move!

06:27.310 --> 06:29.510
Hee Joo! Hee Joo!

06:30.640 --> 06:33.300
Where is she? Where is she, you bastard?

06:33.300 --> 06:34.910
What did you do to her?

06:34.910 --> 06:37.750
What are you saying?
Why would Hee Joo be here?

06:37.750 --> 06:42.240
Hee Joo texted us saying
that you kidnapped her.

06:42.240 --> 06:46.610
You psycho bastard, where is Hee Joo?
What have you done to her now?

06:46.610 --> 06:49.550
I don't know what you are talking about.

06:49.550 --> 06:53.600
- Please put the knife down.
- You think you can fool me again?

06:53.600 --> 06:58.700
If you even laid a finger
on my daughter, I'll kill you!

06:58.700 --> 07:01.860
<i>[10:05 a.m., 5 minutes after
the murder attempt of rapist Yum Gi Tae]</i>

07:01.860 --> 07:04.680
<i>[Episode 3: Judgment Time]</i>

07:04.680 --> 07:09.940
<i>[To sin is a human business, but
to justify sins is a devilish business.]</i>

07:09.940 --> 07:13.900
<i>[Tolstoy]</i>

07:14.770 --> 07:18.290
<i>[10:07 a.m., 7 minutes after
the murder attempt of rapist Yum Gi Tae]</i>

07:19.850 --> 07:21.660
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

07:21.660 --> 07:26.290
As I said, he's an expert on cars.
And a computer whiz, too.

07:26.290 --> 07:32.690
He posted the blueprint
of that device on the website "Stab."

07:32.690 --> 07:36.670
The more I find out about Kwak Min Soo,
the more suspicious I get--

07:36.670 --> 07:37.740
- Hey.
- Yes?

07:37.740 --> 07:41.420
- Why was he absent that day?
- I didn't have enough time to find out.

07:41.420 --> 07:45.420
I'm finding that out now.
Just so I can get him...

07:45.420 --> 07:48.420
I think I've met everyone in Poongsan.

07:48.420 --> 07:52.150
You should give me some recognition, no?

07:52.150 --> 07:57.960
Come on, you're not going to praise me?

08:02.280 --> 08:04.370
You think you'll get away with this?

08:06.790 --> 08:10.070
<i>Similar build and age...
Is it him?</i>

08:12.390 --> 08:15.530
- Kwak Min Soo, you bastard!
- Kang Woo!

08:16.970 --> 08:18.530
You...

08:27.290 --> 08:29.140
Stop right there, bastard!

08:29.710 --> 08:32.570
What did I ever do...

08:32.570 --> 08:35.010
Hey, Kwak Min Soo!

08:35.020 --> 08:37.429
Kang Woo, please...

08:37.740 --> 08:40.309
Kang Woo!

08:44.940 --> 08:46.680
Kwak Min Soo!

08:54.050 --> 08:55.880
Stop right there, bastard.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.120
Are you okay?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.740
Dok Ki, go that way.

09:24.180 --> 09:25.700
<i>- What the heck...</i>
- Sorry.

09:33.180 --> 09:35.510
Bastard.

09:38.110 --> 09:41.000
- It's you?
- He's not here.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.040
Go search everywhere!

09:44.680 --> 09:48.140
- Captain Do's not picking up his phone.
- Try the radio.

09:48.890 --> 09:51.980
I don't think he has a radio.

10:08.490 --> 10:13.740
Where were you on June 2nd?
Look me in the face!

10:13.740 --> 10:15.680
You know me, right?

10:15.680 --> 10:18.170
- What the heck are you saying?
- Stop.

10:37.250 --> 10:41.760
- Damn it...
- Are you okay?

10:41.760 --> 10:43.620
What took you so long, jerk?

10:43.620 --> 10:44.710
No...

10:44.710 --> 10:47.830
- Captain Koo, where are you?
- You have a radio?

10:47.830 --> 10:50.730
- No, she gave me one...
- You idiot.

10:50.730 --> 10:52.890
How can you say that to me?

10:52.890 --> 10:56.200
- It's an emergency.
- Give that to me.

10:57.100 --> 10:59.800
This is more urgent.
Track a cab for me.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.990
Plate number 31-501.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.100
The passenger is an officer
from Opo Station, Kwak Min Soo.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.590
He may be the main culprit
in the case from three years ago.

11:09.590 --> 11:12.600
<i>Agent Jin, track the cab and
Officer Kwak Min Soo from Opo.</i>

11:12.600 --> 11:13.680
<i>Sure.</i>

11:13.680 --> 11:18.160
If you ever go off on your own again,
you'll go immediately back to jail.

11:18.160 --> 11:24.240
- Don't forget it.
- Do you enjoy threatening people?

11:25.100 --> 11:27.200
It's a warning.

11:28.390 --> 11:30.860
A child rapist from
six years ago was released

11:30.860 --> 11:33.100
and we received report
that he kidnapped the victim.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.350
The victim's last cell phone location
was at the suspect's villa.

11:36.350 --> 11:39.740
The victim's father went into
the suspect's villa with a knife.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.490
Damn.

11:47.490 --> 11:49.590
Dok Ki, go after him!

11:54.020 --> 11:55.990
She must have been raped
when she was young.

11:55.990 --> 12:00.420
- Oh my goodness...
- After he was released, this happened...

12:05.390 --> 12:07.750
- Mrs. Oh Soo Nim?
- Yes, that's me.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.800
I'm Detective Koo
from the Golden Time Team.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.950
Are my daughter
and husband safe?

12:12.950 --> 12:16.680
Your husband went into Yum's home,
and we sent a dispatch team out there.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.110
Your daughter left for school
and was kidnapped?

12:19.110 --> 12:21.170
- Yes.
- I need to check the text message.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.300
We'll trace her way to school,
and figure out the kidnapping site.

12:29.300 --> 12:33.100
I'll go too.
I know the exact way Hee Joo takes.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.600
We are here at Poongsan Fish Market.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.310
We're on the move with the caller
after confirming the text message.

12:44.950 --> 12:48.630
According to the guard, two members
from a nearby church were visiting.

12:48.630 --> 12:51.360
- The door was locked, so...
- Captain Do's not there, yet?

12:52.840 --> 12:55.720
Speak of the devil, he's here.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.700
Don't you know that
time is of the essence here?

12:58.700 --> 13:02.810
What are you doing here, Detective Yang?
Chief Na sent you to watch over me?

13:02.810 --> 13:05.050
- What are you saying...
- We have no time for this.

13:05.050 --> 13:08.670
Since it's your first day,
I'll lead the way.

13:08.670 --> 13:11.150
- Is there another entrance?
- No, that's the only one.

13:11.150 --> 13:13.940
The three of us will go first,
so come in behind us.

13:13.940 --> 13:18.560
Get a few officers to search the area,
and find Hee Joo and her phone.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.680
- Yes.
- There are possibly three hostages.

13:21.680 --> 13:26.800
Hwang Ki Hyuk is very angry
right now, so be careful.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.720
<i>Captain, please turn on your radio
so we can hear everything.</i>

13:31.720 --> 13:34.330
You should just come out
here yourself then.

13:34.330 --> 13:37.800
I never went to her school,
nor do I want revenge.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.390
All I did was visit your store.

13:40.390 --> 13:42.240
You're lying again!

13:42.240 --> 13:45.500
I know you did it. Where is she?

13:45.500 --> 13:52.080
He was praying with us, he's repented,
and he's never drank since that day.

13:52.080 --> 13:57.190
Think about it, if something
happens to Hee Joo

13:57.190 --> 13:58.940
I would become the suspect.

13:58.940 --> 14:00.730
Why would I do such a thing?

14:00.730 --> 14:07.010
I have this around my ankle
that tracks my location.

14:07.010 --> 14:09.940
It will show where I was
at the time Hee Joo went missing.

14:09.940 --> 14:11.810
Bastard!

14:11.810 --> 14:14.480
Shut your mouth!

14:18.400 --> 14:22.410
I know you're lying! Where is she?

14:28.990 --> 14:33.490
Police! Calm down
and put the knife on the floor.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.560
Police?
Why are you aiming that at me?

14:41.700 --> 14:44.260
This jerk kidnapped my daughter!

14:44.260 --> 14:46.860
- Hwang Hee Joo's not here.
- Please help me...

14:46.860 --> 14:49.240
You are mistaken.

14:49.240 --> 14:54.420
I don't remember what happened that day,
but I really want to apologize...

14:54.420 --> 14:57.870
I will never do anything to her again!

14:59.060 --> 15:02.880
<i>Both men are telling the truth.</i>

15:02.880 --> 15:04.890
<i>What's going on?</i>

15:05.650 --> 15:09.140
Captain, I believe
both men are telling the truth.

15:09.140 --> 15:11.820
- The truth?
- Yes, I know.

15:11.820 --> 15:15.420
I understand, but drop the knife.
You heard that Hee Joo's not here.

15:15.430 --> 15:18.300
She wasn't captured on the CCTV
in front of the house, either.

15:18.300 --> 15:22.790
Don't lie to me!
Hee Joo was kidnapped by him.

15:22.790 --> 15:25.200
She texted saying he kidnapped her.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.820
If anything happens to her,
I'll kill you all first!

15:33.390 --> 15:37.680
<i>He's completely worked up,
he may really end up killing Yum Gi Tae.</i>

15:37.680 --> 15:39.190
<i>I need to calm him down.</i>

15:39.190 --> 15:43.190
We just received information
on the GPS anklet.

15:43.190 --> 15:47.260
It's been verified Yum Gi Tae's
been home since yesterday morning.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.510
Oh, that's Hee Joo's keychain.

15:59.330 --> 16:02.510
<i>- Director, something's odd.
- Odd?</i>

16:02.510 --> 16:06.040
She may not have been kidnapped.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.130
What do you mean?

16:07.130 --> 16:08.650
<i>We've sent you the CCTV footage.</i>

16:08.650 --> 16:12.270
<i>A student resembling Hee Joo was seen
heading towards the bus terminal.</i>

16:12.270 --> 16:14.640
<i>Her mother says the keychain
hanging from the bag</i>

16:14.640 --> 16:17.090
<i>looks like the one she received
from a friend before.</i>

16:17.090 --> 16:20.470
<i>And a truck vendor in front
of the store says she saw Hee Joo.</i>

16:20.470 --> 16:22.870
- Have you seen her?
- Yes.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.490
What's wrong with you?

16:27.490 --> 16:30.250
Don't put your hand on me!

16:31.710 --> 16:37.090
It was after school started,
but she went towards the bus terminal.

16:43.390 --> 16:45.920
Then the one on the film here
may be Hee Joo.

16:51.700 --> 16:52.790
This is the call center.

16:52.790 --> 16:57.150
We have footage of Hee Joo going
towards the bus terminal at 9:30 a.m.

16:57.150 --> 17:01.150
And around 8:40 a.m., we have
footage of her near Hope Villa.

17:01.150 --> 17:06.099
It seems she went to Hwai after leaving
home, then went to the bus terminal.

17:06.099 --> 17:10.480
We suspect Hee Joo may have plotted
this to send Yum Gi Tae back to prison.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.579
Sir, please calm down.
Hee Joo is probably safe.

17:14.579 --> 17:20.170
- We spotted her somewhere else.
- Then you are saying she lied?

17:20.170 --> 17:25.569
How can you cops
only side with this bastard?

17:25.569 --> 17:27.990
You call yourselves police?

17:27.990 --> 17:34.490
Sir, we have video footage of Hee Joo
heading towards the bus terminal.

17:34.490 --> 17:37.340
- If you would like, we can show you.
- What?

17:45.500 --> 17:49.650
You think I'll believe you?

17:49.650 --> 17:55.410
<i>If you keep this up, I'll kill him.</i>

17:55.410 --> 18:00.050
Director, we've told him Hee Joo's safe,
but he won't believe us.

18:00.050 --> 18:01.660
<i>What do we do?</i>

18:01.660 --> 18:07.480
<i>He's ready to stab Yum Gi Tae.
I need to find a way to calm him down.</i>

18:11.890 --> 18:14.370
The next bullet is for you,
Mr. Hwang Ki Hyuk.

18:14.690 --> 18:17.140
It's been found that
Hee Joo plotted all this.

18:17.140 --> 18:23.570
You think if you take this chance
to kill him, you'll be able to relax?

18:23.570 --> 18:25.100
No.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.210
You are mistaken.

18:29.820 --> 18:31.850
Shut up!

18:31.850 --> 18:36.700
You know nothing about
the pain we went through, so shut up.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.270
You don't know anything!

18:41.500 --> 18:43.890
He's ruined my daughter!

18:43.890 --> 18:45.100
No!

18:45.100 --> 18:48.690
If you kill him here...

18:50.100 --> 18:52.950
Hee Joo will become a murderer's child.

18:55.350 --> 18:58.430
You have no idea what that's like.

19:02.030 --> 19:06.630
She'll live every day thinking that
she may become a monster.

19:07.310 --> 19:10.410
Even if that jerk deserves
to be ripped to pieces...

19:12.100 --> 19:17.000
Even if Hee Joo asked
you to kill him for her...

19:20.610 --> 19:22.500
If you are Hee Joo's father...

19:23.890 --> 19:26.340
If you truly love her...

19:30.890 --> 19:33.390
You need to stop here.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.680
Over there!
That's Hee Joo, right?

19:51.680 --> 19:54.330
- Yes.
- We've found Hee Joo.

19:54.330 --> 19:55.500
Hee Joo!

19:56.320 --> 19:59.040
When you meet Hee Joo,
make her audible to everyone.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.340
What are you doing here?

20:01.340 --> 20:05.270
<i>You know what mess you've created?</i>

20:05.270 --> 20:12.220
<i>Your dad has gone to his home.</i>

20:13.890 --> 20:15.330
<i>What?</i>

20:15.330 --> 20:18.100
<i>Why did Dad go to his house?</i>

20:44.410 --> 20:47.140
Mr. Hwang Ki Hyuk,
you are under arrest for trespassing

20:47.140 --> 20:49.600
causing bodily harm,
and for property damage.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.500
You have the right to an attorney,
and the right to defend yourself.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.130
<i>Let's go.</i>

21:00.630 --> 21:05.780
- My goodness, blood...
- I'm fine.

21:05.780 --> 21:08.100
I'm at fault here.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.740
Detective.

21:16.410 --> 21:18.710
Thank you for saving my life.

21:18.710 --> 21:26.950
God must have had mercy on me
seeing how earnestly I prayed.

21:28.690 --> 21:30.600
Stop your crap.

21:31.390 --> 21:34.760
The victim and her family haven't
forgiven you, so you're not forgiven.

21:36.690 --> 21:39.190
If you really want to be forgiven...

21:39.190 --> 21:44.480
suffer more than them,
and live your life in hell, got that?

21:51.200 --> 21:52.770
Yes...

21:53.830 --> 22:00.610
You know that it's not good for anyone
to make an issue out of this, right?

22:00.610 --> 22:03.840
Yes, of course... And Detective...

22:03.840 --> 22:07.760
- Hee Joo's father...
- Let me see your wound.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.210
I hope he'll be okay... Wait.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.100
- What's wrong?
- I have rhinitis.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.710
It bothers me when the air gets stuffy.

22:14.710 --> 22:15.920
<i>- Rhinitis?
- Yes.</i>

22:15.920 --> 22:17.390
<i>Rhinitis?</i>

22:17.390 --> 22:21.050
<i>Then he would have a nasal voice
due to stuffed passageway.</i>

22:21.050 --> 22:24.600
<i>But he sounds like he's holding
his breath because of a bad smell.</i>

22:24.600 --> 22:28.020
Captain Do, is there
a bad stench in the house?

22:28.020 --> 22:30.730
I think Yum Gi Tae
is lying that he has rhinitis.

22:30.730 --> 22:32.170
A stench?

22:41.800 --> 22:43.370
I don't smell anything.

22:46.390 --> 22:48.150
- You have rhinitis?
- Yes.

22:48.150 --> 22:52.500
You must have felt stuffy.
Do you have a nasal spray, then?

22:52.500 --> 22:55.600
Yes, but...

22:55.600 --> 22:58.530
I don't use it often
because I can build up a tolerance.

22:59.180 --> 23:01.780
I got it when I was in jail.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.190
I shouldn't complain, I deserve it.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.510
What's that red thing?

23:06.510 --> 23:11.060
Oh, it's cotton I used
to clean up a wound.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.310
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

23:17.000 --> 23:20.560
He's really acting like he has rhinitis.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.780
We're done here. Let's wrap it up.

23:22.780 --> 23:27.940
You'll need to come with us too
so you can give your testimony.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.020
Thank you, detectives.

23:32.020 --> 23:37.360
I'm sorry I caused a mess, I pray
God's blessings be with you, thank you.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.560
Yes, amen.

23:41.500 --> 23:47.000
- Please be strong.
- Thank you.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.610
<i>That's odd, it sounded like he was
holding his breath because of a stench.</i>

23:53.600 --> 23:56.100
<i>I'll play with...</i>

23:56.100 --> 24:00.930
<i>It's a child's voice.
Am I mistaken again?</i>

24:00.930 --> 24:04.490
<i>Yeah, there wouldn't be
a child in that house.</i>

24:04.490 --> 24:06.980
<i>I'm sure it was a sound
from outside the house.</i>

24:08.890 --> 24:11.600
Agent Park, please
look into something for me.

24:13.730 --> 24:17.100
We're heading to Poongsan now.

24:17.100 --> 24:21.560
And Director, Captain Do
is a complete idiot.

24:21.560 --> 24:25.520
You heard him fire that shot, right?

24:26.600 --> 24:29.030
Thank you, come on in now.

24:29.030 --> 24:30.470
<i>Sure.</i>

24:30.470 --> 24:32.600
Let me know when you find it.

24:33.290 --> 24:36.590
What are you doing?
Captain Do, let's go!

24:38.370 --> 24:42.100
<i>[10:40 a.m, 10 minutes after the
murder attempt of rapist Yum Gi Tae]</i>

25:32.100 --> 25:37.110
Fortunately, Yum Gi Tae
did not want to press charges.

25:37.110 --> 25:42.320
If you just apologize,
it will be settled with a fine.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.250
Apologize?

25:46.060 --> 25:50.240
If you had seen what he did
to our Hee Joo six years ago

25:50.240 --> 25:52.710
you would never be able
to say that to me.

25:54.100 --> 25:59.100
Hee Joo didn't even look human.

26:00.600 --> 26:05.260
And he's going around like
he's become a new person.

26:05.260 --> 26:09.340
What good is the law that will
release a bastard like him?

26:10.500 --> 26:17.120
Why do you think
Hee Joo did such a thing?

26:17.120 --> 26:23.230
Yes, it's not that I don't understand
you and Hee Joo...

26:23.230 --> 26:29.500
But with that GPS anklet,
there's nothing Yum Gi Tae can do.

26:29.500 --> 26:34.550
I know this is hard,
but it's best that you forget...

26:35.430 --> 26:36.940
Forget?

26:38.690 --> 26:41.530
How can I forget such a thing?

26:42.200 --> 26:43.670
How?

26:48.080 --> 26:50.720
What about the pain inside?

26:52.690 --> 26:58.070
How can I forget
when my heart still aches?

26:58.070 --> 27:00.280
How?

27:01.630 --> 27:03.590
<i>How...</i>

27:04.270 --> 27:09.750
I think Hee Joo and her dad are
suffering from anxiety disorder and ODD.

27:09.750 --> 27:14.680
Hee Joo was planning to blame
everything on Yum Gi Tae, harm herself

27:14.680 --> 27:17.720
and say that it was him who did it.

27:20.830 --> 27:24.170
How could she think that
such a lie would work?

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
I understand why they call
rape victims "survivors."

27:31.000 --> 27:36.070
She'll have to heal from the wounds
in order to live the rest of her life.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.500
The case has been solved.
I don't know why I still feel so uneasy.

27:51.390 --> 27:53.650
Yeah, Dok Ki. What happened?

27:53.650 --> 27:57.970
<i>Kang Woo, I followed Kwak Min Soo
after he got off the cab</i>

27:57.970 --> 28:00.610
but he disappeared suddenly.

28:00.610 --> 28:03.530
<i>- Trying to escape as a ship stowaway.</i>
- Escape?

28:03.530 --> 28:06.980
<i>- Yes, what should I do?
- Move the car!</i>

28:06.990 --> 28:08.790
Find out the boat schedule.

28:08.790 --> 28:12.160
Search his motel room
to find any clues you can.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.580
Okay.

28:13.580 --> 28:15.830
I'm moving!

28:15.830 --> 28:18.070
He disappeared as soon as
he got off the cab.

28:18.070 --> 28:24.490
If Kwak Min Soo escapes,
our case is finished.

28:32.600 --> 28:36.220
- They're not picking up?
- My sister has a doctor appointment.

28:36.220 --> 28:38.260
I forgot.

28:40.100 --> 28:44.010
Ji Wook, I'll go bring an umbrella.
Wait here, okay?

28:44.010 --> 28:46.040
I'll take you home.

28:48.970 --> 28:52.810
It's so close.
I can go by myself!

28:59.710 --> 29:01.640
Ji Wook!

29:01.770 --> 29:03.440
Ji Wook!

29:07.780 --> 29:11.470
Ji Wook! Invincible Watch!

29:14.540 --> 29:17.130
Ji Wook was able to defeat the monster

29:17.130 --> 29:22.100
and live happily ever after
with his mom, dad, and sister.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.100
Detective.

29:50.800 --> 29:54.480
What are you waiting for?
Apologize to Dad.

30:00.190 --> 30:03.550
Honey, don't do that to Hee Joo.

30:03.550 --> 30:05.220
She didn't do anything wrong.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.760
It's all my fault.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.130
I'm glad you know that.
You ruined everything.

30:10.130 --> 30:13.490
- How can you say that to your dad?
- What did I do?

30:13.490 --> 30:16.100
Dad ruined everything.

30:16.100 --> 30:19.970
If he had left it to the cops,
he would have gone back to jail.

30:20.690 --> 30:26.030
- Or just kill him and go to jail.
- What's wrong with you?

30:26.030 --> 30:29.290
How can you hurt us like this?

30:29.290 --> 30:30.890
Why are you hitting me?

30:30.890 --> 30:33.090
Stop acting like you're hurt.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.280
Nobody here hurts more than I do.

30:38.340 --> 30:42.670
No matter how much I try
to forget it, I can't forget it!

30:45.500 --> 30:48.520
You know what kind
of a jerk he is, too.

30:48.520 --> 30:51.090
I should have just died then.

30:51.090 --> 30:54.100
I would rather be dead
than live like this!

30:54.100 --> 30:57.480
How can you say that?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.470
You wicked girl.

30:59.470 --> 31:03.750
How dare you...

31:03.750 --> 31:05.110
That's enough.

31:06.800 --> 31:10.780
I can stay here alone,
so take Hee Joo and go home.

31:12.310 --> 31:16.990
She probably hasn't eaten all day.

31:17.620 --> 31:20.370
Get her something to eat.

31:20.370 --> 31:24.310
Ji Wook will be home soon, too.
Come on, go.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.410
Oh, Ji Wook...

31:29.690 --> 31:32.040
He called several times.

31:34.110 --> 31:36.260
<i>The phone is turned off...</i>

31:36.260 --> 31:38.050
That's weird.

31:38.050 --> 31:40.830
His phone is turned off.

31:51.500 --> 31:56.100
<i>I put on clean socks this morning...</i>

31:56.100 --> 31:58.590
<i>Mine?</i>

31:58.590 --> 32:01.080
<i>Yeah, mine too.</i>

32:01.080 --> 32:04.770
<i>- Where do you think this happened?
- I don't know...</i>

32:04.770 --> 32:08.000
<i>It must have been
at that brother's home.</i>

32:08.000 --> 32:10.390
<i>We should have helped him clean up.</i>

32:10.390 --> 32:13.810
<i>Yeah, it didn't look that dirty...</i>

32:15.390 --> 32:17.470
Oh my goodness...

32:20.080 --> 32:23.860
Excuse me, what did you just say?

32:23.860 --> 32:25.750
About what?

32:25.750 --> 32:29.380
We're here as witnesses
for that earlier case...

32:29.380 --> 32:32.420
No, what were you saying
about dirty socks?

32:32.420 --> 32:37.560
Oh, we were saying that we should
have helped him clean his house.

32:37.560 --> 32:41.690
These socks were clean this morning,
but look how dirty they got.

32:41.690 --> 32:44.330
<i>That much dust in a house
of someone with rhinitis?</i>

32:44.330 --> 32:47.140
<i>- Show me the wound.
- Wait...</i>

32:47.140 --> 32:49.120
<i>- What's wrong?
- I have rhinitis.</i>

32:49.120 --> 32:51.180
<i>It bothers me when the air gets stuffy.</i>

32:51.180 --> 32:54.500
<i>He held his breath whenever
the female officer got near.</i>

32:54.500 --> 32:57.050
<i>Director, I looked into
what you asked before.</i>

32:57.050 --> 33:03.140
There's a chance Yum Gi Tae may have
one of the worst types of pedophilia.

33:03.140 --> 33:06.170
<i>They usually approach children
by playing games or singing songs.</i>

33:06.170 --> 33:09.270
<i>The parents find out about the
assault late, making the arrest hard.</i>

33:12.690 --> 33:16.180
<i>They may appear very normal,
but when they get attracted to a child</i>

33:16.180 --> 33:18.070
they become abnormally
obsessed and sadistic.

33:18.070 --> 33:21.250
<i>There have been cases abroad where
victims have been tortured and murdered.</i>

33:21.250 --> 33:22.970
<i>What's suspicious about
Yum Gi Tae is that</i>

33:22.970 --> 33:26.130
during the rape, he clipped
Hee Joo's fingernails and toenails.

33:26.130 --> 33:31.800
<i>He denied it, but the parents said
they never clipped her nails that short.</i>

33:31.800 --> 33:35.750
And there is also a recording of him
imitating the voice of a child.

33:35.750 --> 33:39.130
<i>We can't conclude for sure that he's
a preferential pedophile from just this</i>

33:39.130 --> 33:42.630
<i>but they have been used as
circumstantial evidence abroad.</i>

33:42.630 --> 33:44.600
<i>The voice of a child?</i>

33:45.230 --> 33:48.040
<i>Then...</i>

33:49.390 --> 33:52.300
<i>I'll play with little Hee Joo.</i>

33:52.300 --> 33:54.560
<i>Little Hee Joo...</i>

34:01.800 --> 34:04.700
- What's going on?
- I need to talk to you.

34:09.300 --> 34:11.760
Yum Gi Tae doesn't have rhinitis.

34:11.760 --> 34:15.100
He was holding his breath because he
doesn't like the scent of a grown female.

34:15.100 --> 34:16.690
What?

34:16.690 --> 34:18.500
<i>Oh my goodness, blood...</i>

34:20.219 --> 34:22.420
I'm okay.

34:22.420 --> 34:26.320
- That's why he did that...
- There's one more thing.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.710
When he closed the door before,
he said in a child's voice

34:28.710 --> 34:32.219
"I'll play with little Hee Joo."

34:32.219 --> 34:36.110
- "Little Hee Joo"?
- I'm sure he's plotting something.

34:36.110 --> 34:39.280
Little Hee Joo...
Who is he referring to?

34:46.500 --> 34:47.710
Ji Wook.

34:47.710 --> 34:51.130
I'm sure he was mad thinking
Hee Joo sent him to jail

34:51.130 --> 34:53.790
and was plotting to get revenge
as soon as he got out.

34:53.790 --> 34:58.400
But Hee Joo's too old
for him to feel an attraction...

34:58.400 --> 35:01.020
so he's going for Ji Wook.

35:01.020 --> 35:03.260
If he's been thinking
about this since prison

35:03.260 --> 35:06.180
he can do something
even worse to Ji Wook.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.790
Agent Park, track Hwang Ji Wook's cell
phone and Yum Gi Tae's anklet.

35:12.550 --> 35:17.860
Director, the SIM card for Ji Wook's
cell phone was taken out near his school.

35:17.860 --> 35:20.470
And it shows that Yum Gi Tae
is home right now.

35:20.470 --> 35:21.980
Home?

35:23.990 --> 35:25.250
This is the call center.

35:25.250 --> 35:28.230
Hwai Patrol Division, go to Yum Gi Tae's
house to verify his location.

35:28.230 --> 35:29.970
Hear anything about a stowaway?

35:29.970 --> 35:32.080
- Not sure...
- Yes, Kang Woo.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.670
Do you know a broker
who unlocks GPS anklets?

35:34.670 --> 35:38.360
GPS anklets? Yeah, there are some
who claim they can.

35:38.360 --> 35:41.740
<i>From what I know, if you lose weight
and make your ankle skinnier</i>

35:41.740 --> 35:44.770
<i>it's easy to take it off.</i>

35:46.720 --> 35:49.540
He used the GPS anklet as an alibi.

35:49.570 --> 35:52.730
He would rather starve himself
than suppress his sexual appetite?

35:52.730 --> 35:55.260
This psycho bastard.

35:55.260 --> 35:58.790
He's not home right now.
Check the CCTV by his house

35:58.790 --> 36:01.130
and find out if
anybody left in a disguise.

36:01.130 --> 36:03.870
We'll move to Ji Wook's
last known location.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.610
Let's go!

36:13.070 --> 36:16.830
- What's going on?
- Did you get in touch with Ji Wook?

36:16.830 --> 36:20.280
No, I called his school,
and they said he left a while ago.

36:20.280 --> 36:23.120
He's not picking up his phone,
and he didn't go to the store, either.

36:23.120 --> 36:27.410
- He's got nowhere to go.
- What was he wearing today?

36:27.410 --> 36:31.480
Let's see... A blue shirt.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.600
And beige pants.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.450
- Why do you ask?
- What happened to Ji Wook?

36:36.450 --> 36:38.990
- What's going on?
- Did something happen to him?

36:38.990 --> 36:42.420
We're a little worried,
so we've dispatched a team.

36:42.420 --> 36:48.060
One more question, have you noticed
anything different about Ji Wook lately?

36:48.060 --> 36:51.670
- Anyone he's gotten close to?
- Well...

36:51.670 --> 36:58.120
He started drawing a secret friend
since a few days ago.

37:08.610 --> 37:10.630
What's going on?

37:14.190 --> 37:16.190
Okay, thank you.

37:18.350 --> 37:20.780
Captain Do, it's a clown.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.940
Yum Gi Tae's approaching Ji Wook
dressed as a clown.

37:23.940 --> 37:26.190
They're close enough for him
to draw him in his diary.

37:26.190 --> 37:28.290
A clown?

37:31.690 --> 37:34.960
I don't use it often
because I can build up a tolerance.

37:36.190 --> 37:39.070
- I shouldn't complain, I deserve it.
- What's that red thing?

37:39.070 --> 37:41.500
It's cotton I used to clean up a wound.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.370
<i>It was the clown's nose.</i>

37:43.510 --> 37:47.240
Director, I saw an air pump
by the trash can in his house.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.290
<i>He probably used it to disguise himself.</i>

37:53.060 --> 37:55.370
We'll let you know when we find out more.

37:55.370 --> 37:57.720
I know you are worried,
but please wait.

37:58.730 --> 38:03.990
I think Yum Gi Tae's taken Ji Wook.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.380
Look here.

38:09.380 --> 38:14.670
The clown's fingers
look like crawling snakes.

38:14.670 --> 38:18.940
I know what this feels like.

38:19.810 --> 38:23.400
Even when I'm eating...
Even when I'm sleeping...

38:23.400 --> 38:29.340
It feels like the snakes
are crawling all over me.

38:53.500 --> 38:57.000
I feel the snakes crawl
all over my body all day.

38:58.190 --> 38:59.900
I know how that feels.

39:03.790 --> 39:06.000
Hee Joo.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.900
I promise you that we'll save him.

39:18.320 --> 39:23.500
Director, there's been
two non-residents leaving the villa.

39:23.500 --> 39:27.840
The one on the left looks suspicious.
It seems he's blown in air to appear fat.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.600
<i>Captain Do is right.</i>

39:29.600 --> 39:34.180
This is a code zero situation.
Near Dream Child Daycare in Gyeyoung

39:34.180 --> 39:38.610
a child named Hwang Ji Wook has been
kidnapped by a child rapist, Yum Gi Tae.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.740
It's likely Yum Gi Tae has removed
his GPS anklet to roam around freely.

39:41.740 --> 39:44.830
He's a pedophile who fulfills
his sexual fantasies on children.

39:44.830 --> 39:47.610
He must have plotted this out
through the last six years in prison.

39:47.610 --> 39:50.750
If we don't rescue him soon,
the boy's life may be in danger.

39:50.750 --> 39:52.290
Please hurry.

39:52.790 --> 39:56.750
What's this?
That bastard took Ji Wook?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.940
Damn!

40:07.310 --> 40:09.050
<i>We need to find them quickly.</i>

40:09.050 --> 40:13.580
<i>If anything happens to Ji Wook,
his family won't be able to handle it.</i>

40:13.580 --> 40:15.860
<i>The day Yum Gi Tae
came to the fish store</i>

40:15.860 --> 40:18.860
<i>she said his shoes were
muddied from the mudflat.</i>

40:20.940 --> 40:25.680
<i>It's possible he checked out the crime
scene before heading over to the store.</i>

40:25.680 --> 40:29.360
- Hee Joo was raped by the beach, right?
- Yes, an abandoned house near the beach.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.420
Check the CCTVs around there.

40:32.100 --> 40:34.100
To all agents...

40:34.100 --> 40:36.720
Seven-year-old Hwang Ji Wook
has been kidnapped.

40:36.720 --> 40:41.630
Please assist in the search of all CCTVs
from the fish market to the sea.

40:43.550 --> 40:44.970
<i>According to Mrs. Oh Soo Nim</i>

40:44.970 --> 40:48.920
<i>Yum Gi Tae came to her store wearing
muddy shoes a few days ago.</i>

40:48.920 --> 40:52.210
<i>Perhaps he had gone out to
check out the crime scene that day.</i>

40:52.210 --> 40:54.640
<i>There's a chance
they may be near the beach.</i>

41:00.360 --> 41:03.100
There is a probability
that around 5:15 p.m.

41:03.100 --> 41:06.830
Hwang Ji Wook was walking towards
the fish market from his school nearby

41:06.830 --> 41:11.210
and was kidnapped by a child rapist,
Yum Gi Tae, disguised as a clown.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.910
Dispatch team,
search west of the fish market.

41:13.910 --> 41:16.420
- Patrol team, to the east.
- Yes, Sir.

41:16.420 --> 41:19.460
If you find where they may be,
radio us right away.

41:19.460 --> 41:20.560
Yes, Sir.

41:20.560 --> 41:25.360
<i>Seven-year-old Hwang Ji Wook
has been kidnapped in the vicinity.</i>

41:25.360 --> 41:29.280
<i>Exact location, 136-36.
Please respond quickly.</i>

41:30.190 --> 41:32.670
<i>Please hurry.</i>

41:40.080 --> 41:43.000
Wow, it's a clown.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.550
Play with me, Mr. Clown.

41:49.050 --> 41:51.100
I'll...

41:53.790 --> 41:55.900
play with you next time.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.740
I won't forget.

42:04.420 --> 42:08.420
<i>A cabin in sight.
Please send backup.</i>

42:21.880 --> 42:25.110
<i>No visible signs of a child.
We'll continue the search.</i>

42:25.110 --> 42:26.940
- This way!
<i>- Send additional crew.</i>

42:37.900 --> 42:39.740
Excuse me, we're the police.

42:39.740 --> 42:41.680
Please cooperate.

42:59.190 --> 43:01.400
<i>Why haven't they found him?</i>

43:01.400 --> 43:04.680
<i>With that many men,
they should have found him already.</i>

43:12.710 --> 43:16.060
- Hello...
- Have you seen this man?

43:16.060 --> 43:20.920
- Have you seen this disguised man?
- I would have noticed him right away.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.860
I see, thank you.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.890
Have you seen him pass by?

43:29.890 --> 43:32.050
Director, they're not here.

43:32.050 --> 43:33.880
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

43:36.500 --> 43:39.500
Director, near the sea,
there is a sashimi center

43:39.500 --> 43:42.100
that closed due to resident objection,
right by the mudflats.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.420
Director, we found a clown.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.700
This is the call center.
A clown we presume to be Yum Gi Tae

43:49.700 --> 43:52.110
- has entered a sashimi center.
- What?

43:52.110 --> 43:55.830
<i>Please divide up the team,
and search the building.</i>

43:56.500 --> 43:59.100
Dispatch team will head in,
the rest of you stay on standby.

43:59.100 --> 44:00.600
Yes.

44:00.600 --> 44:04.500
<i>[5:30 p.m., 15 minutes into
the child kidnapping case at Gyeyoung]</i>

44:34.290 --> 44:36.000
Ji Wook.

44:45.290 --> 44:47.440
Where am I?

44:59.190 --> 45:04.500
We will start playing a very fun game.

45:04.500 --> 45:06.690
It's called...

45:08.400 --> 45:10.420
"Let's Become Adults."

45:10.420 --> 45:12.830
I don't want to play that game.

45:12.830 --> 45:16.400
My mom will be worried.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.400
I want to go home.

45:20.100 --> 45:21.330
Why?

45:21.330 --> 45:24.760
Don't you want to
become like your sister?

45:25.770 --> 45:28.590
Your sister used to be so pretty.

45:28.590 --> 45:32.960
And we used to be lovers.

45:33.600 --> 45:37.400
But she's grown up too much,
so we had to break up.

45:39.600 --> 45:43.340
So you'll have to replace her, okay?

45:45.050 --> 45:47.780
Hee Joo...

45:51.430 --> 45:54.170
Damn it.

45:59.780 --> 46:06.290
If it weren't for that bitch Hee Joo,
I would have become a good teacher.

46:06.290 --> 46:09.070
A teacher like a friend.

46:12.500 --> 46:15.050
Should we play now?

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
<i>The building has at least
five sections on each floor.</i>

46:21.000 --> 46:24.240
<i>Yum Gi Tae must have rehearsed this
sick crime in his head over and over.</i>

46:24.240 --> 46:26.290
<i>I'm sure he'll be quick
without hesitation.</i>

46:26.290 --> 46:29.380
We'll each take a section,
and open up every door.

46:29.380 --> 46:33.290
Call out Ji Wook's name loudly, and if
you feel he's in danger, fire your gun.

46:33.290 --> 46:35.670
- I'll take full responsibility.
- Yes, Sir.

46:35.680 --> 46:40.940
Ji Wook!

46:53.720 --> 46:56.140
- Ji Wook!
- Ji Wook!

46:56.140 --> 47:00.150
Ji Wook!

47:01.100 --> 47:02.560
Ji Wook!

47:04.310 --> 47:05.540
Ji Wook!

47:09.960 --> 47:12.210
Ji Wook! Ji Wook!

47:12.210 --> 47:14.560
Ji Wook!

47:16.650 --> 47:18.010
Ji Wook!

47:20.160 --> 47:21.420
Ji Wook!

47:50.030 --> 47:53.690
Mister... Mister...

47:53.690 --> 47:55.740
You're so pretty.

47:57.100 --> 48:00.900
A pretty girl...

48:01.790 --> 48:04.320
needs to have
clean hands and feet, right?

48:06.040 --> 48:08.350
No...

48:12.100 --> 48:13.720
Ji Wook.

48:15.360 --> 48:16.690
Hey.

48:34.650 --> 48:37.640
<i>Ji Wook!</i>

48:39.590 --> 48:41.610
Here... I'm here!

48:46.900 --> 48:50.250
- How did they know I'm here?
<i>- Ji Wook!</i>

48:50.250 --> 48:51.560
Ji Wook!

49:01.000 --> 49:02.470
Ji Wook...

49:02.470 --> 49:03.500
Ji Wook!

49:27.010 --> 49:32.210
Either Ji Wook is unconscious, or he's
in a situation where he can't answer.

49:32.890 --> 49:35.130
<i>We need more clues.</i>

49:41.000 --> 49:42.610
Director!

49:42.610 --> 49:44.560
- I need to see her.
- No.

49:44.560 --> 49:46.430
Please... Director!

49:48.080 --> 49:50.640
- Ji Wook has an invincible watch.
- An invincible watch?

49:52.500 --> 49:56.210
He gave it to me
for my birthday last year.

49:58.330 --> 49:59.980
<i>It's just a regular toy.</i>

49:59.980 --> 50:04.400
<i>Every night, I would scream
because of the nightmares</i>

50:04.400 --> 50:07.900
so he broke his piggy bank
to buy that for me.

50:09.230 --> 50:13.290
Hee Joo, whenever the monster comes out

50:13.290 --> 50:17.000
if you press the button and say,
"Summon! Invincible Watch!"

50:17.000 --> 50:19.900
the monster will disappear.

50:23.070 --> 50:26.600
Hey! I told you not to bug me.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.590
Get out. Get out now.

50:32.900 --> 50:39.210
<i>He may be too scared to remember
that he has the watch on...</i>

50:39.210 --> 50:41.130
So Ji Wook's wearing the watch right now?

50:41.130 --> 50:43.240
- Yes.
- Okay.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.640
Director.

50:44.640 --> 50:49.450
I don't want Ji Wook to go through
the same nightmares I went through.

50:49.450 --> 50:55.400
Director, please, find him and save him.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.720
Just hold on a little bit, okay?

50:59.050 --> 51:00.100
Please...

51:12.500 --> 51:15.690
Ji Wook!

51:22.500 --> 51:23.920
<i>Invincible Watch.</i>

51:23.920 --> 51:25.690
Ji Wook believed a cartoon character

51:25.690 --> 51:28.400
would protect his sister
from her nightmares

51:28.400 --> 51:30.400
- and he's wearing that watch now.
<i>- What?</i>

51:30.400 --> 51:31.990
Make the watch work?

51:31.990 --> 51:35.740
<i>Yes. Turn the radio on
so I can hear where it is.</i>

51:42.510 --> 51:43.720
Okay.

51:44.290 --> 51:45.900
<i>Ji Wook!</i>

51:46.690 --> 51:48.330
Can you hear me?

51:50.110 --> 51:52.250
If you can hear me...

51:53.140 --> 51:55.650
can you summon Invincible Watch?

51:59.100 --> 52:01.600
<i>In order for me to catch the monster...</i>

52:02.600 --> 52:04.750
<i>I need your help!</i>

52:07.100 --> 52:08.690
Ji Wook!

52:09.860 --> 52:12.380
I'll help you!

52:13.000 --> 52:15.710
Please summon Invincible Watch!

52:16.740 --> 52:17.990
Ji Wook!

52:19.760 --> 52:21.590
Can you hear me?

52:23.400 --> 52:25.540
Ji Wook!

53:01.610 --> 53:03.920
Mister...

53:03.920 --> 53:09.470
Are you that mean monster that
comes out in my sister's dreams?

53:09.480 --> 53:16.600
I'm going to punish...

53:16.600 --> 53:18.350
Monster?

53:18.350 --> 53:20.400
Who says I'm a monster?

53:20.400 --> 53:24.890
I'm an angel who made
a love vow with your sister.

53:24.890 --> 53:28.180
I had no idea that bitch
would betray me.

53:28.180 --> 53:30.420
<i>- Ji Wook!
- Ji Wook!</i>

53:31.790 --> 53:34.630
<i>- Ji Wook!
- Ji Wook!</i>

53:36.400 --> 53:38.520
- Ji Wook!
- Ji Wook!

53:38.840 --> 53:42.680
- Your mom and sister are worried!
- Ji Wook, summon Invincible Watch!

53:42.680 --> 53:44.210
- Ji Wook!
- Ji Wook!

53:44.210 --> 53:47.040
I need your help.
Can you help us?

53:47.040 --> 53:53.820
- Ji Wook!
- Ji Wook!

53:53.820 --> 53:55.500
Ji Wook!

54:16.480 --> 54:18.390
Hee Joo...

54:18.390 --> 54:25.180
I'll protect you, Hee Joo...

54:25.180 --> 54:28.940
I'll...

54:44.600 --> 54:48.120
<i>I know I heard something.</i>

54:54.100 --> 54:55.820
Captain Do, I heard it.

54:55.820 --> 54:58.770
<i>It was for a short while,
but I heard a melody.</i>

55:04.100 --> 55:05.630
It's right next to you.

55:19.060 --> 55:20.200
Right here!

55:30.250 --> 55:31.860
Ji Wook! Ji Wook!

55:46.390 --> 55:47.750
Bastard.

55:47.750 --> 55:48.880
Where's Ji Wook?

55:48.880 --> 55:50.290
Where is he?

56:00.290 --> 56:01.970
Get him!

56:04.290 --> 56:05.290
Hey!

56:11.190 --> 56:13.080
Ji Wook.

56:13.080 --> 56:15.640
Ji Wook, are you okay?

56:15.640 --> 56:18.020
<i>- He's breathing.
- Ji Wook.</i>

56:23.600 --> 56:24.800
Get back!

56:40.000 --> 56:41.100
Yum Gi Tae.

56:41.100 --> 56:45.650
You are under arrest for kidnapping,
child sexual abuse, and attempted murder.

56:45.650 --> 56:49.100
You have the right to an attorney,
and the right to defend yourself.

56:49.100 --> 56:52.460
You're finished, asshole.

56:53.060 --> 56:57.670
<i>We're at the crime scene, we have
successfully arrested the suspect.</i>

57:11.640 --> 57:15.290
Ji Wook. Ji Wook, are you okay?

57:20.500 --> 57:22.400
Ji Wook.

57:22.400 --> 57:24.190
I'm sorry I took so long.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.500
It's all finished now.

57:28.230 --> 57:31.690
Mister...

57:31.690 --> 57:36.560
It was that monster that's
been hurting my sister, right?

57:36.560 --> 57:43.530
I took care of him,
so he won't came back again, right?

57:45.100 --> 57:50.010
Yeah, he'll never come back again.

57:50.010 --> 57:51.610
Never.

57:51.610 --> 57:53.450
Good job, Ji Wook.

57:53.450 --> 57:59.310
I want to see Mom, Dad, and Hee Joo.

58:02.000 --> 58:07.060
Okay, I'll take you home.

58:09.050 --> 58:10.620
<i>[5:50 p.m.]</i>

58:10.620 --> 58:13.100
<i>[Child kidnapping case
at Gyeyoung is closed]</i>

58:14.190 --> 58:18.420
Ji Wook's been safely rescued.

58:20.310 --> 58:22.580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

58:23.050 --> 58:25.160
It's all thanks to you.

58:25.160 --> 58:30.310
It's because you went to his house
this morning that we could catch on.

58:31.500 --> 58:37.060
And it's because you opened up that we
were able to miraculously find Ji Wook.

58:40.730 --> 58:48.110
It took this painful incident to show
that pedophiles can't be let off easy.

58:48.110 --> 58:51.600
As a police officer, I apologize.

58:55.790 --> 59:01.710
We will do our best so that
Yum Gi Tae is never released from prison.

59:01.710 --> 59:06.900
You've been sending us signals
and asking for help.

59:08.100 --> 59:10.100
I'm sorry it took so long.

59:11.290 --> 59:12.600
Thank you.

59:13.100 --> 59:16.290
Thank you.

59:17.480 --> 59:19.350
Thank you.

59:19.350 --> 59:22.250
Please go hug Hee Joo.

59:22.520 --> 59:24.050
Hee Joo.

59:30.100 --> 59:34.150
- Come on, let go of me...
- Shut up and go!

59:34.150 --> 59:36.120
Damn it!

59:36.120 --> 59:41.110
What wrong did I do?

59:41.110 --> 59:43.930
This bastard...

59:43.930 --> 59:48.130
You don't know what you did wrong?
You're not human, are you?

59:48.130 --> 59:49.900
You want a beatdown?

59:52.190 --> 59:54.600
Don't get too emotional.

59:56.190 --> 59:58.310
You won't do anything
about this bastard, then?

59:58.950 --> 01:00:01.500
Go down first.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.730
I'll bring him down.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.250
Let's go.

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.590
Come on.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.730
- Am I the bad guy here?
- Come on...

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.190
I see you are much more classy, Captain.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.950
That's it? That's it, asshole?

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.540
A clown?

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:45.760
Putting makeup on your face
won't get rid of your rotting stench.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.250
Even if you get a new face,
people like you won't change.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:54.700
You better hope you get killed in prison.

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.770
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.060
Yes, sir.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.700
But do you know?

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.750
Because you stopped me

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:10.080
I may get out in a few years,
since it was only an attempt.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.320
So tell Ji Wook
to wait just a little bit.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.890
Next time, I'll make sure
we have a lot of fun together.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:22.210
I'll show you what fun is.

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:25.950
- Damn it.
- Be careful.

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:32.790
You bastard, are you crazy?

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.560
Are you okay?
There are two more flights.

01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:42.900
Detective, sir...

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:57.110
Get him in the car.
It's just a little bruise.

01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:58.510
Yes, Sir.

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:01.600
- Come on.
- Let go!

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.710
Thank you, everyone.

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:22.800
Please don't forget that
we're on the front lines of crime.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.850
We may only be here for a month

01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:28.290
but I wish for our team
to continue to grow.

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.120
Thank you.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.680
- Director Kang.
- Yeah?

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.920
Detective Koo just called saying
Captain Do taught Yum Gi Tae a lesson.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.120
I don't think he's as bad as the rumors.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.210
- And this.
- Thanks.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:09.600
My baby.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.820
Are you okay?

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:12.970
You're not hurt?

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:20.190
Yeah, I destroyed the monster
with the Invincible Watch from Hee Joo.

01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:21.590
Good job.

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:24.180
I'm so proud of you, Ji Wook.

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:30.660
Do you know how worried I was?
Why would you follow a stranger?

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.590
- There's Hee Joo's mom...
- Soo Nim.

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:41.970
You must have been so worried.
Are you okay?

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:46.060
- How horrible.
- He'll rot in prison forever...

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.820
You must have been scared.
We'll protect you, don't worry.

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:57.830
- You must have been so worried.
- I respect you so much for your bravery.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.290
Excuse me.

01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:12.810
You have a phone call.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.750
Thanks.

There are pictures of corpses.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:44.290
