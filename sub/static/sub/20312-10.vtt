00:01.752 --> 00:05.380
[Lucy] My grandfather
is my personal hero.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.008
He flew a fighter plane
in World War II.

00:08.008 --> 00:12.179
And this was his helmet
or as they would call
them their "Bone Domes."

00:12.179 --> 00:13.848
[Gerry snickers]

00:16.600 --> 00:19.812
In the late 1940s, hard shell
helmets were introduced

00:19.812 --> 00:22.314
in the military forces
around the world

00:22.314 --> 00:23.899
and the Bone Dome was...

00:23.899 --> 00:26.902
[laughing]

00:26.902 --> 00:30.865
-Sir, is there something funny?
-"Bone Domes" is funny. No?

00:32.950 --> 00:35.410
[laughing] That's a funny word.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.539
-Sir, can I carry on?
-Okay, go ahead.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.500
Okay, the planes would land
on the aircraft carrier.

00:41.500 --> 00:45.212
Or as they sometimes
called it... [giggling]
..."The Bird Barn."

00:45.212 --> 00:48.507
[class laughing]

00:48.507 --> 00:50.759
Seriously?
"Bird Barn" is funny?

00:50.759 --> 00:53.136
But nobody laughed at bone dome?

00:54.889 --> 00:58.350
Come on, grow up.

-Eva. Jeff.
-[Jeff] Gerry.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.542
Bobbi, try these.
They're amazing.

01:23.542 --> 01:24.835
-No, I'm good thanks.
-Go try one.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.420
-No, I'm fine.
-Go...

01:26.420 --> 01:28.630
We should have this in
Hawaii next year.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.173
I'd rather teach
then be at this.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.342
No, a staff retreat
is more of a state of mind.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.553
And you'd actually have fun if
you participated okay?

01:34.553 --> 01:38.057
-That's not happening.
-[Callaghan] Good morning
everyone.

01:38.057 --> 01:39.683
Good morning Mr...

01:39.683 --> 01:41.685
Welcome to this year's
staff retreat.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.187
-[whispers] Go get one.
-Please help yourself to the
refreshments.

01:44.187 --> 01:48.984
Including some pretty
outstanding raspberry
cheesecake cookies,

01:48.984 --> 01:52.988
-baked by our own Mr. Dwyer.
-[applause]

01:52.988 --> 01:55.074
Just to let everybody
know, they're organic.

01:55.074 --> 01:57.200
Not good.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.161
I'm the one who made the
chocolate covered beetles.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.456
So, they're over here.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.464
Okay. Now, every year, we take
one day to grow as a team.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.425
And every year
a different staff member

02:13.425 --> 02:16.428
volunteers to take
the reigns for that day.

02:16.428 --> 02:20.933
-This year, Bobbi
is that person.
-[Bobbi] Ready to rock it, sir.

02:20.933 --> 02:25.186
All right everybody, have fun
and let's build our team.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.023
-If you need me,
I'll be in my office.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, sir?

02:28.023 --> 02:30.317
How come you get to leave
and we gotta stay?

02:30.317 --> 02:34.237
-Are you not part of this team?
-Gotta go.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.572
-Why does he get to...
-[Bobbi] Okay!

02:35.572 --> 02:37.699
Today we're gonna
focus on trust.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.702
'Cause as a staff we need
to cover for each other, right?

02:40.702 --> 02:42.621
We need to take care
of each other.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.373
And to do that,
we need to trust each other.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.876
-So...
-Yeah, uh-huh listen.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.587
When do we get to drink
with each other?

02:50.587 --> 02:52.339
-[laughter]
-That's a good point.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.133
-Uh, three o'clock.
-Okay.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.926
-So I need two volunteers.
-I'll go.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.428
-Great.
-You know what? I can go too.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.889
-[Bobbi] Thanks Jeff.
-[Gerry] What's going on here?

03:00.889 --> 03:04.392
[Bobbi] Okay, this first game
is called: Trust Trumpet.

03:04.392 --> 03:08.981
-[makes trumpet noise]
-Trust Trumpet?
That sounds stupid!

03:08.981 --> 03:11.817
-Thank you, Norm.
-This isn't going so well.

03:13.192 --> 03:15.278
Beetles, bad idea.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.324
-We should be golfing.
-[Bobbi] Please.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.368
We should golf, we should have
a staff golf tournament.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.745
You have to qualify to play.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.083
By signing up for the grade
five leadership seminar,

03:28.083 --> 03:32.211
you've taken your first step
towards telling other people
exactly what to do.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.506
Let me tell you, it's fun!

03:34.506 --> 03:39.178
Okay. Who wants to hop on board
the leader-ship?

03:39.178 --> 03:41.763
You do.
Here's what we're going to do.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.225
We're gonna warm up our brains.
You ready?

03:45.225 --> 03:48.020
[making idle motor sound]

03:48.020 --> 03:50.522
[mimics pull starter]

03:52.440 --> 03:55.318
-Can I go to the washroom?
-No.

03:55.318 --> 03:59.156
Not yet. We're warming up, guys
come on...up, up, up.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.451
This is the silly ball.
When you catch it,

04:03.451 --> 04:06.038
just make a silly noise,
any noise at all.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.873
[Robert makes a silly noise]

04:07.873 --> 04:10.584
Any noise at all,
just make a noise.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.296
Just make a noise.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.758
-[Gerry] This is pointless.
-[Bobbi] No, no, no.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.886
-You are gonna catch me, right?
-My hands are out and I'm right
behind you.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.346
I don't even have to try and I'd
catch you. What is this proving?

04:23.346 --> 04:27.601
Bobbi, I feel some people
are creating an environment
of hostility.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.269
Why is he here?
He's not a teacher.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.979
I'm staff it's a staff retreat.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.773
Okay, this is why people
don't trust you, Gerry.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.357
-People trust me.
-I don't.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.236
-Why do you always...?
-[Leung] Yup, bring it.

04:37.236 --> 04:40.572
You think catching Lisa
is going to make people
trust each other?

04:40.572 --> 04:42.574
Okay, I have a little game
that will demand real trust.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.992
-If you're up for it.
-I'm up for it.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.786
-Great.
-I'll win it.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.662
And I'll be the only one
you trust at the end of the day.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.915
-Bobbi, I'm down. Let's do this.
-Thank you Paul.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.375
Write down a little
secret on a piece of paper.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.628
Something about yourself.
And then just fold it in half.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.755
-I got a doozy.
-[Bobbi] It doesn't
have to be a doozy,

04:56.755 --> 04:58.882
just a little secret.
-[Gerry] Yes it does.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.759
Great, now rip it up.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.636
[Gerry] Do you not feel like
you're wasting our time again?

05:02.636 --> 05:05.513
Okay. Now we'll do that again,
but write down a bigger secret.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.892
Something a little bit darker,
something you want
nobody to know about.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.811
Something you've kept...

05:10.811 --> 05:11.979
-[Gerry] Like a drug addiction.
-Don't tell people.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.981
-Or alcoholism.
-[Bobbi] Doesn't...

05:13.981 --> 05:16.357
-Hookers...
-Right.

05:16.357 --> 05:18.193
Don't give people secrets,
just do your own.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.528
And then put them in this bowl.
Okay? Right away. Real fast.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.572
Whoa, we're not ripping
those up?

05:22.572 --> 05:25.742
-No, we are not.
-Uh, wait now, this one
is a real ripper.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.536
-Let's go.
-[Gerry] Oh, you can trust
I put mine in the bowl.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.705
No, no, no. In the bowl.

05:30.705 --> 05:34.584
Great, now we're going to leave
them in this bowl all day,
out in the open.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.336
Then we're gonna read them as
a group, in front of everybody.

05:37.336 --> 05:39.214
No we're not.
No, we're gonna throw them away,

05:39.214 --> 05:41.883
because we're gonna
trust that nobody's going
to look at them, Gerry.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.012
Fine, go ahead, you can trust
me. Why are you looking at me?

05:45.012 --> 05:48.140
You know, I got faith,
in all you guys.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.101
-[all] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-[laughter]

05:51.101 --> 05:53.312
[Bobbi] Oh no, put it back.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.605
[all] Gerry no!

05:55.605 --> 06:00.110
-Stop that!
-[Bobbi] Okay.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.821
[Gerry] As if I would
take them. What was your secret?

06:02.821 --> 06:05.406
You steal stuff from people?

06:05.406 --> 06:08.409
I will not tell you my secret.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.669
-I come back?
-Oh, no, it's okay. Come on in.
Do your thing.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.132
[breathing heavily]

06:31.266 --> 06:35.229
Pushing the heavies.
It's good to start light.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.655
Thank you.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.618
[Robert] All right little
leaders, this is gonna be fun.

06:50.618 --> 06:54.206
You guys are gonna break me
out of this... prison.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.291
-Did you kill a guy?
-No!

06:56.291 --> 06:59.627
But somewhere back in the
classroom, I've hidden the key.

06:59.627 --> 07:04.174
So it's up to you guys to step
up and take charge and lead.

07:04.174 --> 07:09.554
But remember, without your help
I cannot escape. Locked.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.391
Begin.

07:12.391 --> 07:16.061
[Robert] Remember, this is fun
and it should take about
ten minutes. Tops!

07:18.313 --> 07:22.317
-[Dwyer] One.
-[woman] Two.

07:22.317 --> 07:26.363
-[Lisa] Three.
-[woman] Four.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.699
-I'm gonna blow my head off.
-[man] Five.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.911

07:34.329 --> 07:36.831

07:36.831 --> 07:38.792
[woman] Eight.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.002
[man] Nine.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.839
-What are you doing, Gerry?
-Getting a cookie.

07:44.839 --> 07:48.385
[Lisa] Really? Right next
to the bowl? Come on Gerry.

07:48.385 --> 07:52.639
I didn't even see the bowl.
Look, no one put a
major secret in there.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.849
Come on, let's just see
what's in the bowl.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.310
How about you just keep away
from the bowl Gerry?

07:56.310 --> 07:57.644
-[Gerry] Okay, I will.
-[Bobbi] Great.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.605
Everybody look at
Gerry, he's getting a cookie,
'cause we don't trust Gerry.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.565
Oh my god, he got a cookie.

08:05.610 --> 08:10.031
[scatting to himself]

08:11.908 --> 08:13.994
Come on you guys.
I know you can do this.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.996
You're the best juniors
we've got.

08:20.292 --> 08:23.878
Some would even say
you're... top shelf.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.591
[Gerry] This is fun. Fun, fun.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.303
[Gerry sighs]

08:32.887 --> 08:34.764
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.766
Nah, you didn't miss anything.
Look at this game.

08:36.766 --> 08:40.770
It's just game after game.
Okay? Actually, we're gonna
play charades.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.397
Why don't you grab one
out of the bowl.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.483
-I love charades.
-Yeah, that's the charades bowl.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.151
-Yeah? Me?
-Yeah do one. Go first.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.112
-No, please don't read
that Simon.
-[Gerry] First word. I, I.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.614
[all clamoring] Gerry, stop.
Stop. Simon! No, stop.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.451
-Pray? Bow. Zombie?
-[Bobbi] Simon.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.453
-[All] Stop, no!
-[Bobbi] Simon!!

08:56.453 --> 08:59.873
What? Gerry said we were
playing charades.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.625
It was "I was in a cult."
Is that a film title?

09:02.625 --> 09:04.461
-[Whispers] My God.
-I've never seen that film.

09:04.461 --> 09:08.089
Is that a series
of teen romance novels?

09:08.089 --> 09:10.509
So, somebody was in a cult.
Wow, these are uh...

09:10.509 --> 09:15.222
[clears throat]
These are, these are bad
secrets. Real secrets.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.015
Gerry, I thought you said
you were trying to earn
everybody's trust?

09:17.015 --> 09:19.600
-What's going on here?
-Simon, these are everyone's
secrets.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.187
That's a pretty crazy way
to play charades.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.732
And you read one, you read one.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.778
-What was zombie stuff?
-What was this, what was this?

09:30.778 --> 09:32.780
-That's you praying.
-[Gerry] You kept drinking.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.575
-[Simon] Jonestown,
the Kool Aid.
-[Gerry] Do the Waco guy.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.245
-I should have done Waco.
-[Gerry] Yes.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.039
-I should have done Waco.
-Next time.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.254
Simon.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.672
What are you doing?

09:49.672 --> 09:52.008
Oh, everybody wants to
know what's in the bowl.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.635
-Okay, for me...
-I felt really bad, so I wrote
up a bunch of my own secrets.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.012
-You can put them in the bowl.
-Just get out, get out.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.597
-Real doozies in there.
-Get out.

09:57.597 --> 10:01.142
-That's fair.
-Okay, can you just promise me

10:01.142 --> 10:03.395
you won't look at the secrets
in the bowl, all day?

10:03.395 --> 10:05.188
-I won't touch it.
-Swear on your life.

10:05.188 --> 10:08.775
Promise, I will not.
Start trusting me!

10:08.775 --> 10:12.362
-[dry chuckle] Yeah.
-Promise.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.283
-Not gonna.
-Okay.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.576
Okay?

10:17.576 --> 10:19.244
-All right, shake on it.
-Shake on it.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.788
No secrets in the bowl.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.290
Stop, you're squeezing
a little bit.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.958
-Okay.
-Ow, strong.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.378
-Because I'm trusting you.
-You should. You should.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.090
-Okay, thank you.
-All right. You're welcome.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.092
Probably gonna take
these with me.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.553
-Yeah, just in case something
happens.
-Yeah.

10:39.097 --> 10:42.225
[whistling]

10:44.352 --> 10:46.146
-Toilet tower got taller.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.897
What am I doing?

10:47.897 --> 10:51.985
Help! Hey, there's a man
in here.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.199
Better start conserving this.
Okay, this is easy.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.953
Simple, I just have to take
charge and lead myself out
of here.

11:01.953 --> 11:07.708
Cell phone, still no reception.
Nail clippers, won't help.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.086
Wallet.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.426
Oh, no!

11:18.886 --> 11:20.514
Oh, no!

11:22.182 --> 11:25.684
-Stretching, yes?
-Yeah, I'm gonna go for a run.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.480
A careful jog,
good for old heart.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.650
Actually, I like to push the
pace, I'm going to run... fast.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.776
Sure, sure.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.694
I can kick your butt
in a race, any day.

11:35.694 --> 11:38.490
[laughing loudly]

11:38.490 --> 11:40.741
This is not so.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.952
All right, let's go,
you and I right now.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.497
-I will crush you.
-You're going down.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.957
-I will butcher your heart.
-What?

11:47.957 --> 11:50.335
You are going to die!

11:50.335 --> 11:53.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't talk to me like that.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.174
Baby cannot take the
garbage talk?

11:56.174 --> 11:58.385
All right, let's go.
Right now. Come on.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.641
Was it you in a cult?

12:04.641 --> 12:07.227
No, Gerry. It wasn't me.
Give it a rest.

12:07.227 --> 12:12.815
Could be Leung. Although,
I think Leung would
probably start a cult.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.985
-[Lisa laughs]
-What's going on over there?

12:15.985 --> 12:19.364
-They're talking about me
being in a cult.
-That's who I thought it was.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.783
Come on, everybody thought it
was Leung, right?

12:22.783 --> 12:25.828
-No, no, okay hold on you guys.
-I was not in a cult.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.582
-It's cool if you were.
-That is not my secret.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.125
-How many wives do you have?
-Stop it!

12:31.125 --> 12:35.505
-Do you want some Kool Aid?
-I was born without testicles.

12:44.222 --> 12:49.143
I was born without testicles
too, if that makes you
feel any...

12:49.143 --> 12:51.354
[Simon quietly] Sorry.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.022
You can't tell.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.110
Come on, come on.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.029
This is crazy.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.408
I told you this was crazy
Yasmine Bleach.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.745
In fact, I told all you guys
this was crazy.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.788
Don't panic, Robert.
What would Tony Robbins do?

13:09.788 --> 13:13.293
Why, he'd motivate the door
to open through positivity.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.213
Whayah!

13:19.674 --> 13:21.926
[glass smashing]

13:21.926 --> 13:24.345
Not how I want to spend
my long weekend.

13:26.931 --> 13:30.143
So, Bobbi, are we going to tear
up the secrets now?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.811
-I guess so.
-No, no, can't tear them up now.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.982
-We gotta tell
everybody's secrets.
-No, Gerry, come on.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.817
-No, that's not fair to Leung.
-What are you talking about?

13:38.817 --> 13:40.570
How does he know we're not
walking around

13:40.570 --> 13:43.822
telling every single person we
meet that he has no testicles?

13:43.822 --> 13:46.033
He needs to have something
on us to make this fair.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.868
We have to level
the playing field.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.828
-So, we're reading the secrets?
-We're reading the secrets.

13:49.828 --> 13:52.749
-You first.
-No, this is not how this is
supposed to go.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.751
I have no problem going first.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.253
And we don't want just
any old secret, we want
the one you wrote down.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.922
-Yeah, let's hear it Gerry.
-Well, the one I wrote down...

13:59.922 --> 14:03.217
Simon is a virgin.
That is my secret.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.890
Hey, buddy.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.314
[Sighs]

14:16.314 --> 14:19.317
And I feel a relief,
in getting that off my chest.

14:19.317 --> 14:22.320
'Cause I've been holding
that in.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.039
So, are we going to open these
secrets or what?

14:33.039 --> 14:36.959
-[Bobbi] No, we have to
wait for Simon.
-Paul, what's your secret?

14:36.959 --> 14:40.880
Well I have this crippling fear
of flying. It's so hard to talk
about because...

14:40.880 --> 14:42.965
[Gerry] Can't fly,
afraid of planes, we get it.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.760
Thanks Lisa, that's a great one.
Paul?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.347
Okay, I was the one
who was in the cult.

14:49.347 --> 14:54.268
For two weeks I was a Raelian.
I was 19, the recruiter
was so handsome.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.813
Okay Trudy. Okay, good one.

14:56.813 --> 15:00.441
Okay Paul, what do ya got?
What's your secret?

15:00.441 --> 15:03.236
Gerry, you need to go and find
Simon and apologize, Gerry.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.155
This whole day has been boring,
I am not missing the best part.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.824
You told everyone
that he was a virgin.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.076
That was my secret,
and nobody knew.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.661
I just assumed he was a virgin.

15:13.454 --> 15:18.418
Nobody's gonna tell another
secret right? While I go.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.128
Paul, don't tell your secret
until I come back.

15:24.507 --> 15:27.218
It's called testicular agenesis.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.931
[gasping]

15:31.931 --> 15:34.642
[Callaghan] Sorry you couldn't
keep up. Maybe next time.

15:34.642 --> 15:39.731
Okay. Okay, okay.
You win your game.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.776
Now, we play mine.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.779
-What the hell was that?
-Slap battle. Where I come from,
popular game.

15:45.779 --> 15:49.323
-Whoever slaps last, wins.
-Hey, cut that out.

15:49.323 --> 15:52.159
You cut that out.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.676
[sighs]

16:12.931 --> 16:14.933
Look, I feel terrible, okay?

16:14.933 --> 16:17.685
You've got nothing to be ashamed
of, you're saving yourself

16:17.685 --> 16:19.186
for a woman.
I think that's sweet.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.689
-I'm not saving myself.
-You're not sav...?

16:21.689 --> 16:24.275
Okay, that's kind of
embarrassing at your age then.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.779
Thanks Gerry.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.656
I don't know what to say.
What do I say?

16:29.656 --> 16:31.157
I don't know what to say
to a virgin, who's 27.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.951
You know what? I don't either,

16:32.951 --> 16:35.286
because ever since I was a kid
I've never had any male friends.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.622
Every dude I've ever known
has bullied me.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.582
And you're just another one
of those dudes.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.918
I thought you were
a different kind of dude.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.963
Okay, I'm not a dude,
we don't say dude anymore.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.757
I get why women don't like me.
Okay? I understand.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.092
But I'll never understand why me
and dudes can't be buddies.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.470
I shouldn't have said that
in front of everybody.

16:52.470 --> 16:58.643
Okay? So I apologize.
But we're buddies.

16:58.643 --> 17:01.312
We're buddies at work.
We hang out. We do stuff.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.898
-That's a buddy right there.
-Work buddies?

17:03.898 --> 17:07.443
Yes! During the week we do tons
of stuff while we're at work.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.946
-What about weekends?
-Oh, we're not buddies
on weekends.

17:09.946 --> 17:13.157
Yeah, you got stuff going on.
Me, too, I'm pretty busy.
Summers?

17:13.157 --> 17:17.537
No, summers I leave, you leave
we come back, we're buddies
again in September.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.039
-Okay, but during the week.
-'Til three o'clock every day.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.375
And then we go our
separate ways again.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.461
Let me ask you something.
Did any of the female
staff members

17:25.461 --> 17:27.421
mention sleeping with me,
out of sympathy?

17:27.421 --> 17:30.424
-No, but I think Trudy,
I think Trudy.
-Trudy said something?

17:30.424 --> 17:34.679
I could see Trudy thinking:
interesting, I could see that.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.473
Now, there's a lot
of secrets down there

17:37.473 --> 17:39.809
that make being
a virgin look like...

17:39.809 --> 17:42.687
Well no, being a virgin's pretty
bad at your age, but there's
other secrets.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.023
Like Dwyer, we don't know what
he's got, Dwyer's down there.

17:45.023 --> 17:48.526
I bet Dwyer's got a dark
secret. I bet he's a virgin.

17:48.526 --> 17:52.238
Nope, no one else, just you.
We talked about it
when you left.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.199
-You're the only virgin.
-You think so?

17:55.199 --> 17:57.117
-Come on, let's go.
-Okay, dude.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.954
-Don't say dude anymore,
you really should stop
with the dude.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.331
Call the slap battle a tie?

18:02.331 --> 18:05.376
You know what my friend?
Let's call the whole day a tie.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.294
[screaming from closet]

18:10.214 --> 18:13.300
Yasmine Bleach, we did it.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.972
[panting]

18:17.972 --> 18:20.892
Robert?
What are you doing?

18:20.892 --> 18:23.352
Sir, excuse me.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.772
I have a whole room
full of kids to lead.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.869
-Here he is, look who I have.
-[Dwyer] Simon!

18:39.869 --> 18:41.621
-Hey, Simon.
-Hey, Simon.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.498
-Gerry make things
better for you?
-I'm still a virgin but...

18:44.498 --> 18:47.794
-Hey, are we still
revealing secrets?
-Yeah, we're actually on Paul.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.005
Perfect. Let's hear this.

18:51.005 --> 18:54.383
Okay, everybody knows my father
passed away not so long ago,
right?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.385
-You killed him.
-Gerry!

18:56.385 --> 18:58.471
Let him finish.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.848
I just never had a chance
to let him know...

19:02.224 --> 19:04.268
How much of a big inspiration
he was to me.

19:04.268 --> 19:07.187
Yeah? And then what'd you do?

19:09.774 --> 19:12.902
-That... That's the secret?
-It's my father, Gerry.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.905
-Are we counting that?
-Yeah, that counts.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.950
All right, well I guess
that's it, we did it.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.078
-Hold on.
-We still don't have a real
secret from you Gerry.

19:22.078 --> 19:26.373
-Yeah you kinda owe us a secret.
-Okay, well you guys all know
that my...

19:26.373 --> 19:30.003
dad left for work
this morning and...

19:30.003 --> 19:33.965
I never got a chance to tell him
how much I love him.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.675
And what an inspiration
he is to me daily.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.760
-That doesn't count.
-[Gerry] But that's a secret.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.263
That's based on Paul's.
We need a secret of your own,
something personal.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.808
Okay, remember when the coffee
machine broke in the staff room?

19:43.808 --> 19:47.061
You mean hell week?
How could we forget hell week?
It was hell.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.229
I had to take a personal leave
for a week.

19:49.229 --> 19:53.192
-Oh, I had migraines.
-Anyway, uh, I broke it.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.113
And I... I didn't tell anyone,
I just...

19:57.113 --> 20:01.200
And I never make coffee.
Or wash my mug.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.037
-Are you serious?
-Serious.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.788
You don't mess with
a man's coffee.

20:05.788 --> 20:08.624
Sick of this!

20:12.378 --> 20:17.216
-Is he gone? Simon.
-Yeah, he's gone.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.520
I "trust"...

20:29.520 --> 20:32.857
that you are enjoying
the new coffee machine
I bought for everybody.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.775
-It's nice, okay? It's nice.
-Good.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.820
So trust is good,
we're good with trust.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.906
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

20:39.906 --> 20:45.536
Ohhh, you, I owe an apology to.

20:45.536 --> 20:50.208
Some of the things I said in
the staff retreat were not
appropriate considering...

20:50.208 --> 20:54.420
...the horrible situation
you had. So, I'm sorry.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.590
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. So...

20:59.383 --> 21:01.260
...as a peace offering...

21:03.429 --> 21:05.890
-I got you these.
-What are those?

21:05.890 --> 21:08.684
Chinese balls! I swear to God
they're called Chinese balls.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.020
[snickering]

21:11.020 --> 21:14.565
-You're a child.
-Don't be testy, don't be testy.

21:14.565 --> 21:18.194
-[Chinese balls chiming]
-You feel that Leung?

21:18.194 --> 21:21.781
♪ Awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome ♪
