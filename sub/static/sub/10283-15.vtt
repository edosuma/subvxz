WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:05.639
Previously on ER:

00:05.639 --> 00:07.141
He shot me.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.776
CLEMENTE:
They think I did it.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.711
They think
I did it.
All right.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.080
Is there anyone
who can back you up?

00:12.080 --> 00:14.182
Yeah. She's down there.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.349
You've been accepted
into the surgical elective.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.750
Oh, my God. Thank you.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.419
I'm the one who writes
your evaluation,

00:18.419 --> 00:19.453
I'm the one you've
got to impress.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.621
I need you to draw

00:20.621 --> 00:22.056
a blood alcohol
for a suspected DUI.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.791
You gotta help me, Greg.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.159
His blood alcohol
came back negative.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.560
It won't happen again,
I promise.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.628
...because you're
gonna stop drinking

00:27.628 --> 00:29.230
and get yourself
in a program.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.232
Debbie's enlisted me
to give a hand

00:31.232 --> 00:33.067
to a Sudanese doctor who's
a bit short staffed right now.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.269
He works out of a camp called
Dumtalah in Darfur.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.317
( speaks Arabic )

00:55.289 --> 00:57.158
( man coughing )

01:02.796 --> 01:04.831
( coughing continues )

01:06.500 --> 01:07.735
Dr. Carter?

01:07.735 --> 01:09.170
It is Stephen.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.174
You startled me.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.642
You've been coughing all night.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.244
I brought you some tea.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.878
Thank you.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.781
It is the dryness,
you know?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.250
And the sand.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.584
( coughs )

01:23.584 --> 01:25.853
Happens to everyone
when they get here.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.590
That's good.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.760
Zahra, she made
me that when I came.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.894
And I would drink it
every night

01:33.894 --> 01:35.796
before I went to sleep.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.831
Debbie said you needed
some help here.

01:37.831 --> 01:38.866
Yes.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.202
She's a good person.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.671
And your help
will be appreciated.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.174
So, you and Debbie are, um...

01:46.174 --> 01:48.342
Yes.

01:49.477 --> 01:52.313
How long has that been going on?

01:52.313 --> 01:54.648
Well, she has
been here two months,

01:54.648 --> 01:55.816
so seven and a half weeks.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.618
You know what?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.487
You should go back to bed.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.255
Okay.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.557
And thank you.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.259
No, thank you.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.228
Now we can all get some sleep.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.234
( gunshots )

02:13.234 --> 02:14.268
MAN:
What's that?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.936
It's the Janjaweed again.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.839
You will learn
to sleep through it.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.208
( screaming )
No, Bernie!
No biting!

02:20.208 --> 02:21.809
Am I bleeding?
Did he break the skin?

02:21.809 --> 02:22.876
I am so sorry.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.612
He's not usually like this.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.215
You know what?
I'll get a nurse
to give him the shot.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.916
Can somebody please
take a look at this wound?

02:28.916 --> 02:30.418
Yeah, we're
a little short.
Do it yourself.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.752
Hey, what's this?

02:31.752 --> 02:33.487
Ah, that's for you and
the little bastard.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.388
Thanks, Frank.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.689
Hey,
congratulations.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.458
Thank you.
It was supposed to be a secret.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.759
Everybody was saying you
were getting puffy.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.494
I had to defend you.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.263
Am I getting puffy?
You're not
getting puffy.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.297
Are you on today?
No.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.732
Clemente will
be here at 8:00.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.267
Damn it, I'm bleeding.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.602
You should get a hep panel
and HIV on that kid.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.238
LOCKHART:
Clemente's back
on the schedule?

02:50.238 --> 02:51.439
Isn't that a little
bit too soon,

02:51.439 --> 02:53.307
after everything
that happened.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.643
Which I hear was very similar
to what happened in Newark.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.677
What happened in Newark?

02:56.677 --> 02:57.778
Nothing happened in Newark.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.447
The guy
is a loose canon.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.449
I mean, he's
a suspected murderer.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.983
Look, Dr. Clemente

03:02.983 --> 03:04.918
is an excellent physician
with some personal issues.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.920
That's nothing new around here.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.823
CLEMENTE:
It's the fifth time
you brought me in

03:09.823 --> 03:11.725
this week, man-- five times.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.728
Why don't you put it all down
on this piece of paper and sign?

03:14.728 --> 03:17.565
'Cause if I shot her,
then how did I get shot?

03:17.565 --> 03:19.833
Because she went for the gun,
it went off

03:19.833 --> 03:21.969
and it clipped you in
the shoulder, all right?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.637
Come on, man.
Her husband did it.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.638
Her husband did it, okay?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.607
He was working in Jersey.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.342
Well, then he's got to have
a twin, okay, 'cause I saw a guy

03:28.342 --> 03:29.743
just like him
in my apartment.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.479
Well, if that's true,
if he were there,

03:31.479 --> 03:32.980
why can't I find a neighbor
to back your story?

03:32.980 --> 03:34.848
I don't know, man--
'cause people hate me

03:34.848 --> 03:36.317
'cause I play my music loud,
maybe, I don't know.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.918
Because it's bull, Vic,
and you know it.

03:37.918 --> 03:41.422
Now, we talked to the doctor
and your girl ain't waking up.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.892
So if I were you,
I'd get a lawyer.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.680
( water spattering )

04:44.785 --> 04:46.587
DEBBIE ( angrily ):
This is great.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.688
Just great.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.735
( women chanting in Sudanese )

06:07.735 --> 06:09.703
Okay, okay,
we'll be with you soon.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.708
( chanting stops )

06:19.880 --> 06:20.781
Zahra, where's Stephen?

06:20.781 --> 06:21.882
In the back.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.651
What's wrong?
Everything.

06:23.651 --> 06:24.952
( patient gasping )

06:24.952 --> 06:25.986
Good radial and ulnar pulses.

06:25.986 --> 06:26.787
( grunts )

06:26.787 --> 06:27.555
Are you okay?

06:27.555 --> 06:28.956
I'm fine.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.824
Stephen, the Janjaweed
shot up the reservoir.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.526
There's a patch kit.
Tell the engineer.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.694
He went to Khartoum.
We can't wait.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.995
At least we still have
the bore holes.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.030
We need 15 liters
per person per day.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.632
CARTER:
Cephalexin 500 milligrams

06:38.632 --> 06:39.900
Qid for a week.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.969
You know, why
are you being so calm?

06:41.969 --> 06:43.036
People are drinking sand.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.472
We have been
through this before.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.973
We drain the tank,
patch the holes

06:45.973 --> 06:46.974
and we treat
with chlorine,
so, sweetheart,

06:46.974 --> 06:48.576
please, take two deep

06:48.576 --> 06:49.943
breaths and do
your downtown dog.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.146
Down and out dog?

06:53.146 --> 06:54.582
( chuckles )
It's not funny.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.783
We can't provide basic needs.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.918
What's new?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.920
Fine. Yeah,

06:59.920 --> 07:01.489
be like that.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.759
Oh, I have two more,
but I'll just save them

07:05.759 --> 07:06.927
for someone
who's listening to me,

07:06.927 --> 07:07.995
appreciates me.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.130
She was like this in the Congo?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.832
She was worse.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.635
At least in the Congo
we had television and beer.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.136
I'm not saying anything
against anyone's religion,

07:16.136 --> 07:17.805
but this place would drive
anybody to drink.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.972
ZAHRA
Dr. Carter?

07:18.972 --> 07:20.541
I need you in here.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.111
It's, um, downward dog.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.181
Ah...

07:29.783 --> 07:30.984
( Carter coughing )

07:33.821 --> 07:35.923
I.V.'s already in.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.864
( Zahra speaking Arabic )

07:43.864 --> 07:45.265
I hear that
you're feeling better.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.801
( Zahra speaking Arabic )

07:47.801 --> 07:49.603
( Osman speaks Arabic )

07:49.603 --> 07:52.573
( speaking Arabic )

07:52.573 --> 07:54.274
They want to go home.
Tell her that I'm going

07:54.274 --> 07:56.944
to give him some medicine
so that we can release them.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.951
Who's this?

08:03.951 --> 08:07.020
ZAHRA:
His brother, Khalid.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.957
An artist.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.158
May I see?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.966
( speaking Arabic )

08:18.966 --> 08:20.100
ZAHRA:
It's him and his father,

08:20.100 --> 08:22.035
fighting the Janjaweed.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.071
Tell him it's, uh, it's good.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.574
Somebody needs to kick
the Janjaweed's butt.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.242
( Zahra speaking Arabic )

08:29.242 --> 08:31.011
( laughter )

08:31.011 --> 08:32.946
Okay, doxycycline,
single dose,

08:32.946 --> 08:34.582
four migs
per kilo, ORS,

08:34.582 --> 08:36.216
one cup after
each loose stool.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.751
Thank you, Dr. Carter.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.953
She's gonna take
very good care of you.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.922
( Zahra speaking Arabic )

08:48.028 --> 08:49.863
This for me?

08:51.131 --> 08:53.667
( speaks Arabic )

08:58.739 --> 09:00.741
MORRIS:
Dr. Clemente.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.709
How was jail?

09:01.709 --> 09:03.611
I didn't go to jail.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.979
Oh, so you called
that lawyer I left
on your machine?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.681
I don't need a lawyer,
Morris, thank you very much.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.016
Welcome back.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.684
So how'd you survive
without me?

09:10.684 --> 09:11.885
Oh, we did our best.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.054
Oh, yeah?
You okay?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.889
Yeah, I'm okay.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.991
Why? People
talking about me?

09:17.991 --> 09:20.828
Well, they're concerned.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.631
They just want to make sure
you're all right, that's all.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.833
Yeah, well, tell
them not to be so
concerned about me.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.068
You didn't have
to come back so soon.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.903
What's that
supposed to mean?

09:32.072 --> 09:35.643
Yeah, well, before Morris
or somebody starts a blog,

09:35.643 --> 09:38.011
I want to set the
record straight.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.847
I didn't shoot Jodie.

09:39.847 --> 09:40.981
Okay.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.183
But how did you know
about the blog?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.952
That little rat bitch.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.087
KOVAC:
Bolus with a liter of NS,
Hey, wait up.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.989
and ten of realan.
Hey, Kovac, Kovac, wait up.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.023
Wait up.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.092
So what have
you got for me?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.194
Good to see you, Vic,
but you're not on
the schedule today.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.196
Come on, Weaver said
I could come back.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.965
I'm head of the ER,
not Weaver,

09:57.965 --> 10:00.634
and I don't think
you're ready.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.802
So what are you doing, man,

10:01.802 --> 10:03.136
giving me the slow walk
to the door?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.838
I'm looking out for you.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.139
Yeah, well, I can take care
of myself, thank you.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.775
And more importantly,

10:07.775 --> 10:09.142
I'm looking out for
every patient in here.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.411
Patients don't need
to be protected from me.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.080
Dr. Kovac, we've
got a 14-year-old,

10:13.080 --> 10:14.948
auto versus peds
coming in.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.984
Go home, Vic.
I am home.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.418
You're not working today.
Come on, Chief,

10:18.418 --> 10:19.787
put me back on the schedule.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.655
Kovac? Come on.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.857
14-year-old hit by car
going about 30 or 40.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.125
BOY:
Oh, my leg.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.060
Distal deformity
of the left lower extremity.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.796
I'm Dr. Kovac.
What's your name?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.163
Jose Rodriguez.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.198
Jose, you remember
what happened?

10:31.198 --> 10:33.033
I got hit.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.035
Let me guess:
Flute.
Tuba.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.970
Sorry about that.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.138
Any LOC?
MARQUEZ:
Nope.

10:38.138 --> 10:38.739
A and O times four.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.040
Vitals?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.009
Tachy in the 120s,
resps 20s, B.P. 110/78.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.711
Okay, Abby,
you take the airway.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.713
Pratt, you run it.
Let's go.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.983
So, how long
is your wife in Paris?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.919
I don't know.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.186
So how long are with us?

10:53.186 --> 10:55.889
How long
do you need me?

10:55.889 --> 10:59.059
It's hard, huh,
keeping relationships going

10:59.059 --> 11:01.128
doing what we do.
Right.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.363
I have a sweet lady friend
in London named Grace.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.265
Whenever I am in town
we fall in love,

11:05.265 --> 11:07.000
and when I leave,
we fall out.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.468
How does Debbie
feel about that?

11:08.468 --> 11:10.070
She has the exact
same relationship

11:10.070 --> 11:12.740
with some Spanish
photojournalist.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.742
What happens in Darfur
stays in Darfur.

11:14.742 --> 11:15.843
( laughing )

11:15.843 --> 11:17.845
( shouting excitedly )

11:17.845 --> 11:21.148
( laughing, coughing )

11:21.148 --> 11:24.317
( laughs, sighs )

11:24.317 --> 11:26.954
So when do you think
all these people

11:26.954 --> 11:28.055
are going to be able
to go home?

11:28.055 --> 11:29.389
Who knows?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.859
The government funded
the Arab militias

11:31.859 --> 11:33.393
to find and kill
the rebels.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.995
So they burned
the villages,

11:34.995 --> 11:36.964
killed the men,
raped the women...

11:36.964 --> 11:39.767
Whoever survived,
wound up here.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.770
Janjaweed have
turned this place
into the Wild, Wild West.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.905
Kofi Anan and
Colin Powell,

11:44.905 --> 11:46.506
they call this genocide.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.242
And then congress, they
just went on holiday.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.345
I guess 300,000 dead
and a million displaced persons

11:52.345 --> 11:54.114
aren't enough
to get involved.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.184
Does not matter whether it
is Somalia, Rwanda, Darfur,

11:57.184 --> 11:59.019
or New Orleans.

11:59.019 --> 12:03.356
When the faces
are black, the
world moves slow.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.358
Is she doing what I
think she's doing?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.460
Yes. She's
quite a woman.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.830
CARTER:
Hey, how much
for the yoga class?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.031
It's free.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.033
( speaking Arabic )

12:13.033 --> 12:15.202
( kids speaking
in unison )

12:15.202 --> 12:18.105
( laughter )

12:18.105 --> 12:20.173
( speaking Arabic )

12:20.173 --> 12:21.208
What happened?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.110
( speaking Arabic )

12:23.110 --> 12:24.945
He's got
a stomach ache?

12:24.945 --> 12:27.014
Yes. He also
has diarrhea.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.282
( speaking Arabic )

12:29.282 --> 12:31.151
His mother has gone
to get wood.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.853
He doesn't know
where his father is.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.088
All right let's take him back
to the tent

12:35.088 --> 12:36.123
for supervisory rehydration.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.358
( speaking Arabic )

12:38.358 --> 12:40.928
It's okay. We'll fix you up
before your mom gets back.

13:06.453 --> 13:10.123
( women yelling in Arabic )

13:10.123 --> 13:12.525
( women screaming,
men on horses whooping )

13:22.870 --> 13:25.238
( screaming continues )

13:30.577 --> 13:33.446
( screaming )

13:39.219 --> 13:41.421
I'd let him keep it,

13:41.421 --> 13:43.256
but what happens
when the battery dies?

13:43.256 --> 13:44.357
It becomes
iTrash.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.059
( chuckles )

13:46.059 --> 13:47.427
Help! Help! She
needs a doctor.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.029
( speaking Arabic )

13:51.231 --> 13:53.200
( speaking Arabic )

13:55.268 --> 13:57.304
Bring a towel,
go get a stretcher.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.939
Tell Zahra to prep
the procedure room.

13:58.939 --> 13:59.439
( speaking Arabic )

13:59.439 --> 14:01.441
Zanjaweed.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.911
The airway's clear,
she's tachy at 120.
B.P. is 100/60.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.378
DAKARAI:
Two liters
of saline wide open.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.614
She's lost a lot
of blood.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.917
Let's hope it's just from
these lacerations, huh?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.084
( pained groaning )

14:11.084 --> 14:11.919
She's got a
nasal fracture.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.320
( groans )

14:13.320 --> 14:15.355
Probably an inferior orbit
blow-out, as well.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.224
Chest is clear.
Okay, let's get these
lacerations cleared up.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.226
I want to see what
we're dealing with here.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.961
Why did she
leave the camp?

14:20.961 --> 14:23.130
The women have to get
the firewood for their families.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.431
Why don't
the men go?

14:24.431 --> 14:26.366
The men would be killed.
Okay, I.V. is in.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.202
Okay, let's get two of morphine,
and I need two suture kits, too.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.370
4-0 vicryl, 4-0 nylon.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.072
( speaking Arabic )

14:32.072 --> 14:33.406
Where's your husband, Gada?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.408
Whoa, we got a lot
of blood down here.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.310
( groans )
What is it?

14:37.310 --> 14:38.946
Uh, we have, uh, lacerations

14:38.946 --> 14:41.114
and contusions to the
external genitalia

14:41.114 --> 14:42.149
and upper thigh.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.250
No. Enough.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.517
I need to examine her.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.953
She doesn't want
to be examined by men!

14:45.953 --> 14:47.487
She's not comfortable!

14:47.487 --> 14:49.522
She needs post-exposure
prophylaxis for STIs and HIV.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.458
I know.
Okay, she get her
husband in here...

14:51.458 --> 14:53.026
Do not tell him
she's been shamed.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.461
Shamed?
Their word, not mine.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.396
Sudanese men sometimes
disown their wives after a rape.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.031
When Gada awakens,

14:58.031 --> 15:00.267
we'll let her tell her husband
what she chooses.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.071
We're going to regionals.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.073
If I miss practice,
the drum major will bench me.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.141
MALIK:
Pratt, Endocrine saw
your IDDM kid,

15:08.141 --> 15:11.344
so he can go, and KJ's dad is
out here, he's asking for you.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.380
All right, he's got
a little guarding here.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.049
Okay, ultrasound and call
surgery to come take a look.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.450
Here, have them follow up
tomorrow.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.186
Where's Darnell?
Right here.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.988
All right, take your time
with the discharge instructions.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.389
I always do.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.024
What happened this time?

15:24.024 --> 15:26.259
I got in a fight, man.
It's no big deal.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.460
Some cat at
this restaurant.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.695
You been drinking again, D?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.030
Damn, man!

15:30.030 --> 15:31.398
Come on, I blew it, okay?

15:31.398 --> 15:33.633
Had a going-away party
for a buddy at work.

15:33.633 --> 15:37.204
I had a few, next thing I knew,
me and this kid got into it.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.671
Yeah, but you're supposed
to stay clean.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.540
You my sponsor now?
No, man.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.044
I'm your boy who you promised
you were going to come clean to.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.179
Look, I'm not gonna
kick this overnight.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.215
What I need from
you right now

15:48.215 --> 15:50.450
is fix me up before
KJ gets down here.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.484
I don't want him
to see me like this.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.586
Then stop
coming in like this.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.299
Hey, there, Jodes.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.035
How you doing?

16:11.038 --> 16:13.173
I'm sorry I haven't
been around much.

16:13.173 --> 16:17.044
It's just...
I got a lot of problems.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.313
Things are really
messed up, baby.

16:35.495 --> 16:40.333
Look, I can see
you're mad at me.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.202
You been going
to the meetings?

16:42.202 --> 16:44.671
Hell, yeah.
It's hard, man.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.142
DARNELL:
What happened in there?

16:49.142 --> 16:51.111
Kid got hit by a truck.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.812
Come on, hold still.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.515
He gonna be all right?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.084
Who knows?

16:59.086 --> 17:00.487
( speaking Arabic )

17:00.487 --> 17:02.355
( speaking Arabic )

17:02.355 --> 17:04.124
Where she?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.759
Your wife was attacked
outside the second checkpoint.

17:10.762 --> 17:11.763
She okay?

17:11.763 --> 17:13.099
She will be.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.136
Shamed?

17:16.136 --> 17:19.106
She was badly beaten.

17:24.676 --> 17:25.778
See her...

17:25.778 --> 17:27.614
I can see her now?

17:27.614 --> 17:29.582
Yes, come with me.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.692
Oh, Gada.

17:39.692 --> 17:44.131
There are bruises to her
chest and to her abdomen.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.565
But I don't think
that there's any damage

17:45.565 --> 17:46.699
to her internal organs.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.269
She live?

17:49.269 --> 17:52.405
Yes. We gave her some
medicine to help her sleep.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.474
She has many cuts, but
they're not so deep.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.377
And I think the stitches
need to stay in for one week.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.587
She cut here?

18:07.587 --> 18:09.489
Yes, but I think it
will heal very well.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.259
There shouldn't
be any scarring.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.227
Sir. Sir.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.228
Sir!

18:15.228 --> 18:17.630
Sir, wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.832
Wait.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.301
What happened?

18:21.301 --> 18:22.735
I brought him in
to see her.

18:22.735 --> 18:23.736
Did he see the wound?

18:23.736 --> 18:24.771
Yeah.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.708
Slash on the thigh
is the mark of rape.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.613
How the hell was I
supposed to know that?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.182
Where are you going?

18:35.182 --> 18:36.183
I'm gonna go get him.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.517
John!

18:37.517 --> 18:39.419
LOCKHART:
Chuny, what are his vitals?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.888
Pulse 97, resps 20,
BP 102/58.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.390
A hundred percent
on room air.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.724
Heart rate's a
little high.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.326
There could be
occult blood loss.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.427
What took
you so long?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.795
Our favorite surgeon
has arrived.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.430
I was in three
with the Crohn's girl.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.465
Why isn't Albright down there
helping you out?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.767
Please, I was given strict
instructions to handle the ER

18:54.767 --> 18:56.603
so she can scrub in
on an ileoanalanastamosis.

18:56.603 --> 18:57.604
What have you got?

18:57.604 --> 18:58.505
This is a tier one trauma.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.706
He should have been seen

18:59.706 --> 19:00.707
before you dealt
with any other consults.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.542
Well, I heard he was stable.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.743
Thought I'd get the acute
obstruction upstairs first.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.812
That's fine.
No, it's not.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.314
This patient's gonna need
an ex-lap and that takes time.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.381
Ex-lap?
The ultrasound was negative.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.882
What's an ex-lap?

19:09.882 --> 19:12.785
Abdominal pain, tachycardia
and a good mechanism.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.955
That's a bleed until
proven otherwise.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.591
Guys, that's
basic trauma 101.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.892
All right,
get Albright or Dubenko

19:19.892 --> 19:21.394
down here
to evaluate.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.795
I'm sure they'll
agree with me.

19:22.795 --> 19:23.696
Serial hemoglobin?

19:23.696 --> 19:24.764
13 to 11 point six.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.765
Probably dilutional.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.234
Am I gonna have surgery?

19:27.234 --> 19:28.235
We're not sure yet.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.569
RASGOTRA:
This is the ER.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.604
I'm gonna need a CT
of the chest and abdomen.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.639
Thanks.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.374
Get a portable, Chuny.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.376
Would you forget the scan?
It's a waste of time.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.410
Thank you, but I don't agree.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.845
If the CT shows a bleed,

19:38.845 --> 19:39.979
he's going to the O.R.
And if it doesn't?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.681
He's still going to the O.R.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.782
Not necessarily--
we'll OBS him in the unit.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.651
OBS? That doesn't sound good.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.486
What do you expect
gain from the scan,

19:46.486 --> 19:48.321
other than giving this young boy
a whopping dose of radiation?

19:48.321 --> 19:49.522
Pratt.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.458
A chance to spare him
from an operation

19:51.458 --> 19:53.626
he doesn't need, a better sense
of what we're dealing with.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.861
Surgeons don't like surprises.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.762
You're not a surgeon.

19:55.762 --> 19:56.763
Today I am.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.267
( sighs )

20:00.267 --> 20:01.734
Give her a break, Pratt.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.303
PRATT:
Neela.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.971
Neela, listen, I've got
a lot more experience

20:04.971 --> 20:06.739
with pediatric traumas
than you do.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.508
Kids are tricky.
They have a huge reserve.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.443
They maintain normal vitals
for a long time,

20:10.443 --> 20:11.944
but believe me,
when they crash they crash hard.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.446
The CT scan
is simply part

20:13.446 --> 20:14.914
of the complete workup
of the patient.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.416
It'll take 15 minutes.
We've got time.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.417
I don't think you do.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.885
It's my call, Pratt.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.753
Dad.
Are you okay?

20:20.753 --> 20:23.856
You have to tell Monty I won't
be able to play tonight.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.792
Don't worry about that, son.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.327
The officer
wants to ask you

20:27.327 --> 20:29.296
some questions
about the accident.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.730
Did you get a description?

20:30.730 --> 20:33.366
He was a black dude,
blue pickup.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.834
You see the license plate?

20:34.834 --> 20:38.004
All I remember is that
the side door was smashed,

20:38.004 --> 20:40.673
and the grill
was crushed.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.675
Oh, and there was
bumper stickers,

20:42.675 --> 20:44.243
lots of Bears
bumper stickers.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.646
Malik, take a break.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.448
What's up?

20:48.448 --> 20:50.883
I need you to
take a break.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.559
What's wrong?

20:59.559 --> 21:00.593
You still drive
that old truck?

21:00.593 --> 21:01.961
Yeah. Why?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.696
Because that kid you
were so curious about,

21:03.696 --> 21:04.897
the one who got hit,

21:04.897 --> 21:06.966
says the guy who hit
him was a black dude

21:06.966 --> 21:08.835
who drove a blue pickup!

21:08.835 --> 21:10.937
There's a million brothers
drive blue pickups.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.872
I'm not talking about
a million brothers!

21:12.872 --> 21:14.507
I'm talking about you!

21:14.507 --> 21:16.743
Did you hit that kid?

21:16.743 --> 21:17.810
Yo, Greg...

21:18.678 --> 21:20.747
Answer me!

21:20.747 --> 21:23.816
Did your drunk ass
hit that kid?

21:27.454 --> 21:29.055
Greg, I-I didn't mean
to hit him, man.

21:29.055 --> 21:32.559
It was an accident,
man, I swear.

21:32.559 --> 21:33.693
It was an accident, man.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.495
I didn't mean to
hurt that kid.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.530
I swear to God.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.499
( sighs )

21:44.904 --> 21:46.773
( speaking Arabic )

21:49.776 --> 21:51.578
I think it's this one.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.746
I think it's this
one up here with the
Oxfam logo on it.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.816
( weakly ):
Okay. Hey.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.858
Salaam...

22:05.858 --> 22:07.427
Salaam.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.629
( speaking Arabic )

22:09.629 --> 22:12.499
( speaking Arabic )

22:14.066 --> 22:15.702
What's he saying?

22:15.702 --> 22:18.905
He said Lwendo went
to find the Janjaweed.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.807
She said it happened
by the second checkpoint.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.575
Don't do this.
Maybe we can stop him by
the time he gets there.

22:22.575 --> 22:23.876
It's too dangerous.
This is my fault.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.412
It's Lwendo's fault.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.013
He knows it is suicide
to leave the camp.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.715
He's right. Carter,
you'll get yourself killed.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.650
So could Lwendo.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.154
Look, I'll go.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.756
I at least
know where it is.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.057
You stay.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.792
Drive.

22:43.663 --> 22:44.797
Is my dad still here?

22:44.797 --> 22:46.165
RASGOTRA:
He's outside.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.067
No talking, Jose.
You have to hold still.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.869
Liver and spleen
look good.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.671
How's he doing?
Why are you here?

22:51.671 --> 22:53.540
Following up on my patient.
Vitals are good?

22:53.540 --> 22:54.807
I've got this, Pratt.

22:54.807 --> 22:55.742
Apparently, you don't.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.544
Why are you here?

22:57.544 --> 23:00.112
Dr. Pratt was concerned that you
were not receptive to his input.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.147
So concerned, actually, that

23:01.147 --> 23:02.949
he had to page
me out of the OR

23:02.949 --> 23:04.884
to come see this patient.
You went over
my head?

23:04.884 --> 23:06.453
I want to make sure
we didn't miss anything.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.120
I'm doing exactly what you said.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.523
I'm getting the ER to work up
their patients completely.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.125
No, not really, since you're
the one here doing the CT.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.861
( alarm )
TECH:
Heart rate is up to 125.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.963
Got some fluid
in the retroperitoneal fossa.

23:16.963 --> 23:17.964
That could be blood.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.799
Scan's over.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.901
Retroperitoneal injury wouldn't
show up on an ultrasound.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.536
Jose?

23:23.536 --> 23:24.937
Jose?
He's hypotensive
and nonresponsive.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.639
He was just talking,
and his heart rate was

23:26.639 --> 23:27.840
in the 90s before you walked in.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.841
Get two units type specific.

23:30.477 --> 23:31.944
Send off another set
of blood cultures.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.514
Change to Zosyn and up the
dopamine to ten mikes.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.616
Hey, whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.817
You just skipped
right over her.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.018
What are you doing?

23:39.018 --> 23:40.787
We just rounded
on her ten minutes ago.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.555
I don't think so.
I checked the chart.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.624
I didn't see any new orders.
Come on, what are you doing?

23:44.624 --> 23:47.193
I need to know
what's going on.
I'll catch up with you.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.996
She's off pressors, stable from
a cardiopulmonary standpoint.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.665
We're just waiting for her
neuro status to declare itself.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.901
So, what are you
going to do now, hmm?

23:54.901 --> 23:56.669
What are you going to do?

23:56.669 --> 23:59.071
You're gonna sit back
and twiddle your thumbs?

23:59.071 --> 24:00.707
Is that what
you're gonna do?

24:00.707 --> 24:02.742
We're gonna wait.
That's all we can do.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.949
( phone rings )

24:12.018 --> 24:13.786
What's up?

24:13.786 --> 24:16.623
KENYON:
How does it feel, Vic?

24:16.623 --> 24:18.558
Who is this?

24:18.558 --> 24:20.660
KENYON:
How does she look now?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.862
You still want to touch her?

24:22.862 --> 24:25.197
You sick twisted piece of...

24:25.197 --> 24:27.266
Yeah, I might not
have finished the job.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.968
But it's still
a beautiful thing.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.036
The cops were all over you.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.838
You wait, man.

24:31.838 --> 24:34.173
You wait till she wakes up
and starts talking, all right?

24:34.173 --> 24:36.242
'Cause you're gonna be
in a world of hurt...

24:36.242 --> 24:37.276
Keep dreaming, buddy.

24:37.276 --> 24:40.112
You got out of Jersey okay.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.549
You're not gonna pull that off
this time.

24:42.549 --> 24:43.750
Oh, you don't think?

24:43.750 --> 24:45.818
You know, she was mine.

24:45.818 --> 24:49.021
( voice breaking ):
And you never should have
touched her.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.865
Is that kid
gonna be all right?

24:58.865 --> 25:00.867
I don't know.
He's up in the OR.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.301
We're trying to
stop the bleeding.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.303
Look, man, I messed up.
Man, I'm sorry.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.238
I went out on
a limb for you.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.641
I risked my job to
cover for you because
you promised me

25:08.641 --> 25:09.976
you were gonna
get help.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.812
I'm trying. All I do
is think about drinking.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.647
I wake up,
I want a drink.

25:14.647 --> 25:17.149
I walk down the street,
I want a drink.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.752
I see the winos on the corner,
and I'm jealous.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.120
I just think to myself,

25:21.120 --> 25:22.889
If I could get through
raising KJ,

25:22.889 --> 25:24.190
get him through college,

25:24.190 --> 25:26.659
then I could be out there
with them dudes.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.294
Come on, man.
Are you listening to me?

25:28.294 --> 25:29.796
This is serious.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.731
I'm not proud of it,
but it's serious.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.332
What's serious is,
that kid could die.

25:33.332 --> 25:36.002
And I know that,
and I'm sorry for it.

25:36.002 --> 25:39.038
But what else you want me to do?

25:39.038 --> 25:41.240
Turn yourself in.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.809
What did you say?

25:42.809 --> 25:44.611
You heard me.

25:44.611 --> 25:48.781
Look, you talk about raising
KJ to be honest, right?

25:48.781 --> 25:50.116
Got him working up in here

25:50.116 --> 25:51.784
to teach him integrity
and respect.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.053
Now, how's he supposed
to learn that

25:54.053 --> 25:55.855
if you just get
away with this?

25:55.855 --> 25:57.690
I ain't going to jail.

25:57.690 --> 26:00.827
You've got
to turn yourself in, D.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.868
CARTER:
What does he think he's
going to accomplish?

26:08.868 --> 26:10.036
For a man like him,

26:10.036 --> 26:11.971
pride slips away
on a daily basis.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.674
They can't provide
without getting killed,

26:14.674 --> 26:16.776
so their wives must do it.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.845
And then the worst happens.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.212
He's had enough.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.214
Just wants to be a man again.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.952
This...

26:25.952 --> 26:27.920
This is one
of the places.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.770
Doesn't seem to be
anybody around.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.838
Let's go a
little further.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.941
Look, the further we go,

26:48.941 --> 26:50.943
the more dangerous it gets.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.681
Now I'm sorry,
but we are going to turn around.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.822
( engine revving )

27:13.866 --> 27:16.302
( speaking Arabic )

27:19.338 --> 27:21.808
( speaking Arabic )

27:40.860 --> 27:41.994
How is she doing?

27:41.994 --> 27:44.731
( speaking Arabic )

27:46.032 --> 27:48.000
She wants to know
where Lwendo is.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.905
( speaking Arabic )

27:52.905 --> 27:54.774
( speaking Arabic )

27:56.843 --> 27:58.845
( speaking Arabic )

27:58.845 --> 28:00.346
( speaking Arabic )

28:00.346 --> 28:02.081
Tell her we have doctors
out looking for him.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.249
( speaking Arabic )

28:03.249 --> 28:04.416
Her children.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.218
They're here. I'll get them.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.257
Come on.
Your mother's awake.

28:24.804 --> 28:27.774
( speaking Arabic )

28:27.774 --> 28:29.141
( speaking Arabic )

28:29.141 --> 28:30.142
( whispers ):
What's he asking?

28:30.142 --> 28:31.310
Asking if we have weapons.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.112
We don't have
any weapons.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.781
( loudly ):
We don't have
any weapons.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.883
We're doctors.
( speaking Arabic )

28:36.883 --> 28:38.484
( speaking Arabic )
A woman was raped, we're
here trying to find...

28:38.484 --> 28:40.119
He said shut up
and so do I.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.453
Okay, I'm just saying
they can help us.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.923
John...

28:49.295 --> 28:51.297
( speaking Arabic )

28:54.801 --> 28:55.835
( speaking Arabic )

28:57.804 --> 28:59.872
( speaking Arabic )

28:59.872 --> 29:02.842
( speaking Arabic )

29:08.881 --> 29:10.817
Look, John,
there's a lot of corruption.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.318
The government, the military,
the police, everybody.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.220
They could have helped us.
They could have helped us.

29:14.220 --> 29:17.056
Yes, but then the U.S. would
prefer to have conversations

29:17.056 --> 29:20.292
with criminals like Salah Gosh.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.427
Who's Salah Gosh?

29:23.495 --> 29:26.032
Your government flew him
to Washington to get intel

29:26.032 --> 29:27.934
on the war on terrorism.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.401
They wouldn't be able
to do that

29:29.401 --> 29:31.537
if they started
pissing off Bashir.

29:31.537 --> 29:32.972
Wouldn't be able
to get our hands

29:32.972 --> 29:34.907
on the oil out
here, either.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.476
( chuckles )

29:37.476 --> 29:40.046
So let's go a
little farther.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.948
It is too late.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.315
A little
farther, please.

29:46.085 --> 29:47.920
No. We are going back.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.856
( groans )

29:49.856 --> 29:51.924
What?

29:51.924 --> 29:53.893
What? What is
going on with you?

29:56.996 --> 29:58.297
It's not
cholera, is it?

29:58.297 --> 30:02.301
I'm fine.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.302
Cirrhosis.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.838
Spironolactone.

30:05.838 --> 30:06.873
You have hepatitis.

30:06.873 --> 30:08.841
Schistosomiasis as a child.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.978
Left me with a few
liver granulomas.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.280
What is that?

30:16.048 --> 30:17.349
It could be
them, huh?

30:24.223 --> 30:25.257
( sighs )

30:36.202 --> 30:39.005
So what happens now?

30:39.005 --> 30:40.006
He'll get booked,

30:40.006 --> 30:42.041
probably post bail.

30:42.041 --> 30:45.011
My dad's going
away, isn't he?

30:51.918 --> 30:52.952
( sighs )

30:58.357 --> 30:59.591
( shuts engine off )

31:13.672 --> 31:14.941
( whispering ):
John?

31:18.010 --> 31:19.045
( sighs nervously )

31:21.113 --> 31:24.350
( men shouting in distance )

31:27.486 --> 31:29.155
( whispering ):
John!

31:29.155 --> 31:31.357
( voices grow louder )

31:39.631 --> 31:43.435
( soldiers laughing
and speaking in Arabic )

31:51.343 --> 31:53.179
( screaming )

31:53.179 --> 31:55.181
( soldiers laughing )

31:58.684 --> 32:00.119
( whispering ):
We've got to go back.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.220
There's nothing
we can do.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.354
They'll kill him.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.422
They will
kill us, too.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.091
( birds calling )

32:08.294 --> 32:10.029
( shouting in Arabic )

32:11.463 --> 32:12.498
( shouting in Arabic )

32:21.740 --> 32:23.675
Stay still, John.

32:23.675 --> 32:24.710
Say nothing.

32:52.138 --> 32:55.507
( speaking Arabic )

32:55.507 --> 32:57.143
( soldiers laughing )

32:57.143 --> 33:00.146
( repeats phrase in Arabic )

33:00.146 --> 33:02.548
( soldier shouts back
in Arabic )

33:02.548 --> 33:04.550
( laughter )

33:04.550 --> 33:08.054
( repeats phrase in Arabic )

33:08.054 --> 33:10.222
( shouting in Arabic )

33:10.222 --> 33:11.323
( laughter )

33:11.323 --> 33:15.061
( shouting in Arabic )

33:15.061 --> 33:16.295
( shouts command )

33:19.331 --> 33:21.667
( laughter )

33:24.603 --> 33:26.338
( truck door slams )

33:28.507 --> 33:29.608
( two gunshots )

33:29.608 --> 33:31.243
( third gunshot )

33:56.135 --> 33:57.436
Lwendo?

33:57.436 --> 33:58.637
Lwendo, stay with me.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.373
Stay with me.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.843
We got multiple GSWs to
the chest, flank and leg.

34:04.843 --> 34:08.514
Bag the femoral artery,
I need a clamp.

34:08.514 --> 34:09.815
John?

34:09.815 --> 34:11.683
Start an IV.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.219
It is one hour
to camp,

34:13.219 --> 34:15.454
and another two to
the surgical hospital.

34:16.788 --> 34:17.789
John?

34:17.789 --> 34:19.158
Don't worry, Lwendo,

34:19.158 --> 34:20.458
we're gonna get you
back to camp.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.460
Ah!

34:21.460 --> 34:22.828
Damn it!

34:22.828 --> 34:23.862
I need some suction.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.397
I need to intubate him.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.399
We can't even do that
at the clinic.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.735
I lost the pulse.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.643
John?

35:06.838 --> 35:08.540
( weakly ):
Vic?

35:10.342 --> 35:11.610
Vicee?

35:16.315 --> 35:17.783
Oh, my God.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.186
Oh, my God.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.454
Oh, my God, you're awake.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.190
You're awake, baby.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.659
I was so worried about you.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.197
What happened?

35:32.531 --> 35:33.765
You don't remember?

35:38.504 --> 35:40.239
Gunshots.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.873
Yes, yes.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.642
And Bobby...

35:45.911 --> 35:47.213
Bobby shot me?

35:47.213 --> 35:48.780
That's right.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.849
That's right-- you think
you can tell the police that?

35:53.319 --> 35:54.420
Is he in jail?

35:54.420 --> 35:56.588
No. No, not yet, not yet.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.656
But we're going to be okay.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.228
And how long am I
going to be...

36:02.228 --> 36:04.230
How long am I going
to be like this?

36:04.230 --> 36:06.398
Ah, baby, it's just going to be
a little while longer,

36:06.398 --> 36:08.600
about a week or two--
and your moms is coming up

36:08.600 --> 36:09.601
to take you home.

36:09.601 --> 36:12.704
Oh, not my mom, Vic,
please.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.406
It's just going to be
for a little while, that's all.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.308
You got to do it.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.713
We're still going to be
together though, right?

36:23.549 --> 36:25.884
Don't you
leave me now, jerk.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.988
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

36:29.988 --> 36:32.324
You just take it easy,
all right?

36:32.324 --> 36:33.759
I'm gonna get
your doctor.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.794
Okay.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.935
( sighs )

36:43.935 --> 36:45.804
Um, I'm headed out.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.606
Somebody coming
to pick you up?

36:47.606 --> 36:49.941
Yeah, I'm going to stay
with my aunt for a while.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.510
Hey, KJ.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.479
Look, um...

36:53.479 --> 36:55.481
I feel bad
about all this.

36:55.481 --> 36:56.548
But you got
to understand...

36:56.548 --> 36:59.318
It's not your fault.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.853
I mean, every time my dad
picked me up from school,

37:01.853 --> 37:03.522
I could smell
the alcohol on him.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.591
He's going to get
the help he needs.

37:05.591 --> 37:06.625
Thanks to you.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.328
KJ...

37:09.328 --> 37:10.629
Look, all my dad's
other boys,

37:10.629 --> 37:12.964
they just help him
get out of trouble,

37:12.964 --> 37:14.566
but you're the only one

37:14.566 --> 37:17.303
that makes him step up
and take responsibility.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.906
That means a lot,
Dr. Pratt.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.441
A lot.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.812
All right, man.

37:29.515 --> 37:32.318
Damn.
What was all
that about?

37:32.318 --> 37:33.552
How is the kid?

37:33.552 --> 37:35.020
There was a tear
in the mesentery,

37:35.020 --> 37:36.555
which opened up
a small artery.

37:36.555 --> 37:37.789
Easily controlled
once we got in there.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.591
So he's okay?
Yeah.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.460
He didn't drop his pressure,
he didn't code on the table?

37:41.460 --> 37:43.462
No, Pratt, the
case went well.

37:43.462 --> 37:46.465
All right, thank you.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.601
Look, I'm sorry.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.570
You were right, I should
have listened to you.

37:51.570 --> 37:52.671
Oh, forget about it.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.473
He tolerated
the anesthesia okay?

37:54.473 --> 37:55.841
Yeah.
All right, good.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.543
What's going on?
Nothing.

37:57.543 --> 38:00.679
You're lying.
What's up?

38:00.679 --> 38:03.749
I, uh...

38:03.749 --> 38:06.618
I know who hit that kid,
and it's all my fault.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.087
What do you mean
it's your fault?

38:09.087 --> 38:11.657
The cops brought in
a friend of mine a while ago

38:11.657 --> 38:13.091
for a blood alcohol level.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.394
I drew my own blood,
switched the tubes.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.995
What?

38:16.995 --> 38:20.599
He swore to me
he was going to get help.

38:20.599 --> 38:23.101
That kid almost died!

38:23.101 --> 38:25.671
You just said he was fine.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.005
He's got a
pulverized leg.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.374
He needed blood
transfusions.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.841
He's going to be
on a ventilator.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.643
He's going to be in
the hospital for weeks.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.911
You call that fine?

38:32.911 --> 38:34.580
All right,
I made a mistake.

38:34.580 --> 38:37.583
Look, Darnell's
not a bad guy.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.386
Just, at the time, it seemed
like him going to jail

38:40.386 --> 38:41.920
for a DUI wasn't going
to help anybody.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.756
It would have helped
Jose Rodriguez.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.492
He wouldn't be in
the hospital now.

38:46.492 --> 38:48.394
I made him turn himself in.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.928
You think that's enough?

38:51.997 --> 38:53.499
So now what?

38:53.499 --> 38:55.734
You gonna tell Kovac
or something?

38:55.734 --> 38:58.570
You got your friend to own up
to what he did.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.772
Take your own advice.

39:04.576 --> 39:07.679
How about Celine
or Jewel?

39:07.679 --> 39:11.683
Have you been going through
your CD collection again?

39:11.683 --> 39:12.884
I love Jewel.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.786
Well, yeah, me,
too, I guess,

39:14.786 --> 39:16.555
but not for a name.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.493
What about Charo?

39:21.493 --> 39:24.530
( chuckling ):
Or Liberace?

39:24.530 --> 39:27.666
How about we
give him the name

39:27.666 --> 39:29.435
of the first person
who walks through the door?

39:29.435 --> 39:30.469
Seriously?
Sure.

39:30.469 --> 39:33.104
Okay.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.873
Well, maybe not.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.942
Hey, what's up?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.610
That's great news about Jodie.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.745
Thanks.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.447
We were all happy
to hear it.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.749
Maybe now you can put me
back on the schedule, huh?

39:43.749 --> 39:45.851
Give me a sec.
Mm-hmm.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.786
Hey, Vic.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.924
You need to undergo
an evaluation

39:52.924 --> 39:54.826
by the Impaired Physician
Committee.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.862
Come on, you're not
serious, are you?

39:56.862 --> 39:59.465
Medical,
drug testing, psych.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.799
You're serious.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.501
Yeah, well, I don't
need that, okay?

40:02.501 --> 40:03.802
I do.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.106
Okay, fine, fine.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.208
Whatever you need, man,
I'll do it for you, okay?

40:10.208 --> 40:13.111
Okay.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.721
You son of a bitch.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.856
You're screwed, buddy--
oh, yeah,

40:24.856 --> 40:26.658
'cause she's upstairs
telling the cops right now

40:26.658 --> 40:27.693
everything you're doing.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.761
Right now, that's right.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.730
We're gonna get you,
you hear me?

40:31.730 --> 40:32.998
We're gonna get you.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.133
( car horn honking )

40:40.572 --> 40:42.774
Hey!

40:42.774 --> 40:45.677
( tires screeching )
Son of a bitch!

40:58.824 --> 41:01.159
I can't get
Gada to rest.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.961
She's inside
with the children.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.863
Look.

41:04.863 --> 41:09.067
DEBBIE:
She won't have to wait too long.

41:10.135 --> 41:14.072
( speaking Arabic )

41:15.140 --> 41:18.777
( engine shuts off )

41:20.178 --> 41:21.780
Lwendo.

41:21.780 --> 41:24.082
Lwendo!

41:24.082 --> 41:28.019
Lwendo.

41:28.019 --> 41:31.790
( sobbing ):
Lwendo.

41:33.859 --> 41:36.628
( speaking Arabic )

41:36.628 --> 41:39.998
Lwendo, no.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.834
Lwendo.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.904
( speaking Arabic )

41:45.904 --> 41:47.573
Lwendo.

41:47.573 --> 41:50.075
( crying )

41:50.075 --> 41:52.310
( speaking Arabic )

41:52.310 --> 41:53.879
Lwendo.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.881
( all sobbing )

42:02.621 --> 42:06.858
( sobbing continues )

42:16.635 --> 42:21.740
( clattering nearby )

43:03.181 --> 43:07.686
( speaking Arabic )

43:07.686 --> 43:09.888
CARTER:
What is he saying?

43:09.888 --> 43:11.957
It's from the Koran.

43:11.957 --> 43:14.893
"From the earth,
God created you."

43:14.893 --> 43:17.829
( man continues in Arabic )

43:17.829 --> 43:21.733
"To the earth,
God will return you."

43:21.733 --> 43:27.038
( man continues )

43:27.038 --> 43:32.010
"From the earth,
God will bring you out again."
