07:47.092 --> 07:50.345

07:50.387 --> 07:53.140
But I've got two tickets

07:50.387 --> 07:53.140

07:53.181 --> 07:55.309
I mean, I'd love for you to be

07:53.181 --> 07:55.309
my guest if I can find a sitter.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.602
- Jesse and Joey can do it.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.602
- Great.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.314
Then, uh, we can have

My treat.

Pick you up around seven?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.692
- Okay?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.692

08:04.734 --> 08:05.944

Hi, guys.

Well, uh, I'd like to

Daniel, my man!

08:47.235 --> 08:49.446
Alright!

08:49.488 --> 08:50.571
You did what

08:49.488 --> 08:50.571
I told you, right?

08:50.613 --> 08:51.781
You were in there,

08:50.613 --> 08:51.781
you were bold

08:51.823 --> 08:52.949
you were confident,

08:51.823 --> 08:52.949
you asked her out

08:52.991 --> 08:54.075
and she said yes, right?

08:54.117 --> 08:55.785
No, I was shy

08:54.117 --> 08:55.785
and I was awkward

08:55.827 --> 08:58.079
and she asked me out

08:55.827 --> 08:58.079
and I said yes.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.291
- No!

08:59.164 --> 09:01.291
- Yes.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.710
She's treating me to dinner

09:01.333 --> 09:03.710
and to an art exhibit.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.629
She's paying?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.089
How does this shy

09:06.671 --> 09:08.089
and awkward thing work?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.343
Danny, you're gonna

09:10.050 --> 09:11.343

That's right, and we're

09:13.053 --> 09:14.929

09:16.056 --> 09:17.224

09:18.433 --> 09:20.519
How am I gonna tell

09:18.433 --> 09:20.519
D.J. and Stephanie

09:20.560 --> 09:22.687
that their father is

09:20.560 --> 09:22.687

09:23.438 --> 09:24.856
Any ideas?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.733

09:24.898 --> 09:26.733
Mm.

Well, uh..

09:29.361 --> 09:31.571
Uh, tell him, Joseph.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.573
- Trust your instincts.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.573
- That's right. Good thinking.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.658
Trust your instincts

09:33.614 --> 09:35.658
and, uh, uh

09:35.700 --> 09:37.160
tell them exactly

09:35.700 --> 09:37.160
what they need to know

09:37.202 --> 09:38.537
but nothing more. Nothing..

09:38.578 --> 09:39.954
- Just tell them that.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.954
- I like that, Jesse.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.956
- I like that.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.956
- Yeah, thanks very much.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.043
Uh, listen to what they say,

09:41.998 --> 09:45.043
and respond accordingly.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.753
Right. Accordingly

09:45.085 --> 09:46.753
respond to what they say

09:46.794 --> 09:49.423
and most importantly,

09:46.794 --> 09:49.423
be their father!

09:49.464 --> 09:50.924
Yeah.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.719
You don't have a clue how

09:52.592 --> 09:54.719
to handle this, do you?

09:54.761 --> 09:55.762
I don't know what

09:54.761 --> 09:55.762
I'm talking about.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.097
Yeah, I don't either.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.436
Michelle?

10:02.477 --> 10:04.604
You'll tell your sisters

10:02.477 --> 10:04.604
for me, won't you?

10:06.356 --> 10:07.482
Ah, thank you, honey.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.900
You take all

10:07.524 --> 10:08.900
the pressure off.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.902
Give me a kiss.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.488
Thanks.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.782
17 jars from you already.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.742
Deej, take your sister

10:59.784 --> 11:01.869
and sit down,

10:59.784 --> 11:01.869
because right now

11:01.911 --> 11:04.289
I wanna have a little talk

11:01.911 --> 11:04.289
with my three girls

11:04.331 --> 11:07.250
about something

11:04.331 --> 11:07.250
very important.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.170
Tonight, your father

11:07.292 --> 11:10.170
is going on a..

11:11.129 --> 11:12.922
'uh..'

have two more jars.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.968
Great!

11:17.010 --> 11:20.805
You girls, you like Julie's mom,

11:17.010 --> 11:20.805
Mrs. Stratton, don't you?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.015
Sure.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.017
She's a nice hive mother.

11:24.058 --> 11:27.020
Well, great. Because tonight,

11:24.058 --> 11:27.020
Julie's mom and I are..

11:27.728 --> 11:29.272
'We're, um..'

11:29.314 --> 11:31.316
Make it four more jars.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.691
I'm getting good

11:31.358 --> 11:32.691
at this.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.070
I better just say this

11:34.110 --> 11:36.070
before I go broke.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.824
Julie's mom and I

11:37.405 --> 11:39.824
are going out tonight.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.784
Oh, boy!

11:39.866 --> 11:41.784
Where are we going?

11:44.204 --> 11:47.248
No, angel, it's just me

11:44.204 --> 11:47.248
and Julie's mom.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.669
Why can't we go?

11:50.709 --> 11:52.212
Steph, you don't get it.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.505
They're going on a date.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.131
Dad doesn't want us there.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.715
They want to be alone.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.177
Uh, D.J., wait!

11:59.219 --> 12:01.471
It's not that we

11:59.219 --> 12:01.471
want to be alone.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.890
We just, we wanna get

12:01.513 --> 12:03.890
to know each other.

12:03.931 --> 12:07.143
Well, dad, couldn't you

12:03.931 --> 12:07.143
just stay home with us?

12:07.185 --> 12:11.231
Um, I need you to, uh,

12:07.185 --> 12:11.231
help me with my homework.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.733
And Stephanie probably needs

12:11.272 --> 12:14.733
you too, right, Steph?

12:14.775 --> 12:16.069
I guess so.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.991
Daddy, if you go

12:19.239 --> 12:21.991
on a date tonight

12:22.033 --> 12:24.536
is Julie's mommy

12:22.033 --> 12:24.536
gonna be our new mommy?

12:25.704 --> 12:26.996
Your new mommy?

12:28.164 --> 12:29.999
Of course not.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.253
You know,

12:31.125 --> 12:33.253
people go out on dates

12:33.294 --> 12:35.046
and they don't get married.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.049
You understand that,

12:36.089 --> 12:38.049
don't you?

12:39.842 --> 12:40.843
I don't know.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.596
I'm not sure

12:40.885 --> 12:42.596
what's going on.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.972
I'll tell you exactly

12:42.637 --> 12:44.972
what's going on.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.267
We need dad here,

12:45.014 --> 12:47.267
and he's leaving.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.228
Why don't I just, uh

12:50.270 --> 12:54.148
change my plans and-and stay

12:50.270 --> 12:54.148
with you three girls, then?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.860
For the rest of my life.

[instrumental music]

13:06.411 --> 13:08.496
Hi, Linda,

13:06.411 --> 13:08.496
yeah, it's Danny.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.916
Look, I feel real

13:09.706 --> 13:11.916
uncomfortable about this

13:11.958 --> 13:14.502
but, uh, I have to

13:11.958 --> 13:14.502
cancel out on our date.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.339
I-I'm starting to feel like

13:15.920 --> 13:18.339
it's too soon for this.

13:19.633 --> 13:20.967
Thanks for understanding.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.344
Yeah. Bye.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.766
(Jesse)

13:26.180 --> 13:27.766
'What happened?'

13:27.806 --> 13:30.268
I thought you were

13:27.806 --> 13:30.268
ready to start dating.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.981
I was, until I saw the looks

13:30.310 --> 13:34.981
on those girls' faces.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.691
Although Michelle

13:35.022 --> 13:36.691
took it pretty well.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.571
You think I should have kept

13:39.402 --> 13:41.571
my date with Linda, don't you?

13:41.613 --> 13:44.365
- Yes, I do.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.365
- I agree with him.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.409
Who said that?

13:46.451 --> 13:48.827
Look, Daniel,

13:46.451 --> 13:48.827
yes, it is hard on

13:48.869 --> 13:50.371
the girls, man,

13:48.869 --> 13:50.371
but they love you.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.748
They'll learn

13:50.413 --> 13:51.748
to deal with it.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.542
I just think my dating

13:51.790 --> 13:54.542
will be so much easier

13:54.584 --> 13:56.919
once the girls

13:54.584 --> 13:56.919
are away at college.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.255
Oh, yeah,

13:56.961 --> 13:59.255
you'll be pushing 50

13:59.297 --> 14:01.007

Danny, this is always

14:09.557 --> 14:12.185

Well, no.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.525
is yours.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.027
What do<i> you</i> really

14:18.566 --> 14:21.027

I really wanna

14:21.068 --> 14:22.570
go out with Linda.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.754
for me to start dating?

23:17.771 --> 23:20.566
because you're gonna

23:17.771 --> 23:20.566
wake me up at 3:00.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.442
- Buh-bye, Deej.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.442
- Bye.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.444
Say good-bye to Steph

23:22.484 --> 23:24.444
for me.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.239
- Shall we go?

23:24.486 --> 23:26.239
- We shall.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.116
You kids behave

23:27.698 --> 23:29.116
yourselves.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.618
That's right. Take two dimes

23:29.158 --> 23:31.618
for a phone call. Go.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.913
Go on. Have fun.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.664
- 'Be good.'

23:33.954 --> 23:35.664
- 'Go on.'

23:37.958 --> 23:39.501
Alright, Michelle.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.670
This is the moment we've

23:39.543 --> 23:41.670
all been waiting for.

23:41.712 --> 23:44.464
It's time to throw away

23:41.712 --> 23:44.464
Benny the dishrag

23:44.506 --> 23:46.424
because you're now

23:44.506 --> 23:46.424
the proud owner

23:46.466 --> 23:49.345
of a brand new

23:46.466 --> 23:49.345
man-eating tree house!

23:49.387 --> 23:50.846
(together)

23:49.387 --> 23:50.846
Yay!

23:50.888 --> 23:53.307
Alright, pal. Here we go!

23:50.888 --> 23:53.307
Here we go! Ready?

23:53.349 --> 23:55.142
- Whee!
