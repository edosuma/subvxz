01:06.191 --> 01:07.817
Look at this.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.778
-Which color do you want?
-Look at this.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.237
Where are you?

01:12.030 --> 01:14.324
-What? You're not sure?
-Where are you?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.785
-What do you want?
-Hey. Look at this.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.496
-Don't touch that. Put that back.
-That's not for boys.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.209
<i>Look at this.
They came and put this up again.</i>

01:24.876 --> 01:26.544
They are going to start tomorrow.

01:28.129 --> 01:31.257
Where could I go
when I haven't been compensated yet?

01:31.341 --> 01:35.011
On top of that, that jerk An Hyeon-seong
isn't answering my calls.

01:35.094 --> 01:38.056
He is looking down on me. I know he is.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.559
I shouldn't have signed

01:41.643 --> 01:43.686
the consent form that easily.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.271
I shouldn't have signed it.

01:45.355 --> 01:48.858
If you didn't sign it,
you wouldn't even be here.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.402
I even went to see him at school.

01:51.486 --> 01:54.948
But they stopped me at the main gate.
They treated me like some criminal.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.117
For matters like this,

01:57.200 --> 02:00.537
you must talk to each other
face to face to prevent misunderstandings.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.831
They wouldn't
even let me enter the school!

02:02.914 --> 02:04.499
Then go to his house.

02:07.669 --> 02:11.840
It's his son's birthday tomorrow.
A lot of people will come to the party.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.050
He won't be able
to kick you out that easily.

02:45.331 --> 02:49.127
<i>Clearly, something inside me is broken.</i>

02:56.342 --> 02:57.719
Don't do it.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.265
Don't do what?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.058
Whatever it is.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.315
Don't do whatever it is
you're planning right now.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.364
I can tell when someone is
about to make a big mistake.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.116
I always have.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.166
I should go.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.584
You don't want to either.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.463
Then nothing will change
even if you do it.

03:38.843 --> 03:39.886
I know.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.228
<i>I know.</i>

03:49.354 --> 03:53.233
<i>I know that I cannot undo
what already happened, but I can't stop.</i>

TO HUI-JU

03:57.987 --> 04:02.450
<i>In the end,
my story won't have a happy ending.</i>

04:09.290 --> 04:11.542
<i>I'll rip you to shreds!</i>

04:11.626 --> 04:14.420
<i>Gu Hae-won! Where are you?</i>

04:14.504 --> 04:16.631
<i>Give me my son back!</i>

04:17.173 --> 04:18.758
<i>Ho-su!</i>

EPISODE 11
ANYONE, ANYTIME, CAN BE A MONSTER

04:33.773 --> 04:37.277
I heard that Dracula
and vampires are totally different.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.863
My friends keep telling me
that I should be a vampire.

04:41.447 --> 04:45.118
But they don't know
that Dracula only sucks on women's blood.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.706
What's more,
Dracula is actually the son of a dragon.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.208
I'm the only one
who knows that at my kindergarten.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.545
My dad told me all about it.

04:56.045 --> 04:59.048
So their fangs are big and…

04:59.132 --> 05:00.008
What?

05:01.676 --> 05:03.511
My house isn't this way.

05:05.930 --> 05:09.309
Dracula shouldn't wear silver bracelets.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.103
He burns if he comes into contact
with silver or sunlight.

05:14.647 --> 05:18.401
You talk too much just like your dad.

05:20.945 --> 05:24.574
Mister! You're here
for my birthday party, right?

05:24.657 --> 05:27.410
Mister!

05:34.334 --> 05:36.169
What's going on here?

05:37.587 --> 05:38.713
Go ask security.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.299
Get them to show us more footage
besides this one.

05:41.382 --> 05:42.925
I asked what you were doing.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.594
Ho-su isn't home yet.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.763
He's probably playing--

05:46.846 --> 05:49.474
His kindergarten teacher saw
this man taking Ho-su.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.559
We should call the police first.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.936
Don't make a fuss. Nothing happened yet.

05:54.854 --> 05:55.897
The guests are waiting.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.733
-Tell them to eat first as he's late.
-Mother--

05:58.816 --> 06:01.527
Close acquaintances
will be the first ones to gossip.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.613
Those close to you can be the harshest.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.074
No need to give them fodder for gossip.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.243
Let's look for him
in the immediate area first.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.460
Hui-ju.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.671
Look! A clown!

06:21.672 --> 06:24.092
Kids, don't run. You can't run here.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.302
Gosh. It's pretty chaotic, isn't it?

06:26.385 --> 06:28.763
-Yes.
-You put on an amazing party.

06:28.846 --> 06:31.557
-Thanks. Please enjoy the party.
-We are enjoying it.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.646
-Ms. Jeong.
-Where is she?

06:36.729 --> 06:37.563
Pardon?

06:38.689 --> 06:41.067
Where's Gu Hae-won?

06:41.859 --> 06:44.570
She's taking the morning off.
She'll be here later today.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.366
There she is.

06:55.206 --> 06:58.251
I told you I'd kill you
if you touched my child.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.336
What are you talking about, Hui-ju?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.840
People are watching.
Are you sure about this?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.969
-Ms. Jeong!
-Where is my son?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.055
Ms. Jeong, what are you doing?

07:11.639 --> 07:13.182
Let go and talk it out.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.602
<i>Where are you?</i>

07:18.020 --> 07:19.313
What about Ho-su?

07:19.397 --> 07:23.443
<i>The costume of the man who took Ho-su
wasn't from the event agency.</i>

07:24.777 --> 07:26.654
<i>I called the police. Come back home--</i>

07:26.737 --> 07:29.532
No. You come here.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.117
I'm going to find Ho-su.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.624
The GPS on her phone
was on the whole time,

07:38.708 --> 07:40.918
so we confirmed that
she was around your house.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.338
But she was using public transportation
when your son was dropped off.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.383
And the duration matches
the duration of her commute to work.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.261
I'll call you once we check
the camera on the bus.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.805
-You can go home now.
-Why are you letting her go?

07:53.431 --> 07:56.726
What about her call history?
She could've gotten someone else to do it.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.563
Ma'am, we don't have any witnesses
or evidence that she kidnapped your son.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.523
We cannot hold her here.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.318
And by being here,
she's cooperated with the investigation.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.570
I'll help you too.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.656
I'm good at finding people.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.331
You should answer your phone.

stolen from you.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.602
But I don't think that's your husband.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.481
Stop her. It's her. She took Ho-su.

08:43.564 --> 08:46.067
Where did you take him? Where is my son?

09:06.128 --> 09:08.172
Have you talked to Ms. Jeong?

09:08.256 --> 09:11.676
Did something happen
between Hae-won and Ms. Jeong?

09:11.759 --> 09:13.678
<i>I guess you haven't heard.</i>

09:13.761 --> 09:16.764

What are you doing here?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.391
Going to his house was pointless.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.810
He still won't answer my calls.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.861
Then call him until he answers.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.531
You must make him come
and see what he's done.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.493
When talking doesn't work,
you must make him see it.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.591
Get a grip.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.221
How can I get a grip right now?

10:40.973 --> 10:43.726
And what's with you, Mother?
You dote on Ho-su.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.895
How could you be so calm?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.855
Worrying about it doesn't solve anything.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.483
You must stay cool-headed
at times like these.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.193
What if they demand a ransom?

10:58.407 --> 11:01.410
Did you just laugh? Have you gone mad?

11:02.203 --> 11:05.331
Did you just laugh
after you failed to keep your child safe?

11:07.416 --> 11:09.418
Things must be so convenient for you.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.129
What?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.423
You can just adore Ho-su

11:18.803 --> 11:22.181
-Hey!
-Mom! That's enough.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.351
What did I do? She's lost her mind.

I'm not sure what happened yet.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.382
So I'll call you
after I look into this first.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.009
How can I trust you?

13:22.593 --> 13:24.512
How can I trust you two?

13:26.055 --> 13:27.056
Damn it.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.911
Damn it.

13:51.288 --> 13:52.414
Damn it.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.416
Stop it.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.794
Don't touch that. No!

13:59.255 --> 14:01.549
No!

14:18.065 --> 14:21.151
Where is he? Ho-su.

14:22.778 --> 14:27.783
It was the 3-cushion Championship final
against an Italian player named Vito.

14:28.784 --> 14:32.621
You see, Vito was
the world champion at the time.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.039
Ho-su.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.500
-At the beginning of the final match,
-Ho-su.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.296
He got three shots of nine points
in a row. It was a slugfest.

14:42.172 --> 14:43.924
Vito went second.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.344
And until the fourth inning,
he was seven points ahead.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.471
Everyone said I would lose the match.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.808
But from the tenth inning onward,

14:52.892 --> 14:54.977
he kept missing his shots.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.896
But that's when I started…

14:58.731 --> 15:01.525
my ten-point scoring streak
and kept making high runs.

15:01.609 --> 15:06.155
I kept making high runs!

15:06.238 --> 15:09.283
I kept making high runs…

15:09.366 --> 15:11.577
I kept making high runs, you know.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.580
Do you need money?

15:16.457 --> 15:17.541
I'll give you money.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.836
Where's my son?

15:20.920 --> 15:25.049
I was the first Asian pool player
to beat a world champion.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.843
Cut the crap and tell me! Where is my son?

15:32.014 --> 15:33.057

15:40.898 --> 15:43.150

15:44.860 --> 15:46.654
I'm the one who talks here.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.491
You should listen to what I have to say.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.452
I will.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.038
I will listen to you.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.498
But…

16:00.000 --> 16:02.503
you will have to tell me
only what I'm interested in.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.634
I can put up with your disgusting nature,

16:08.717 --> 16:10.552
but I won't let you take what's mine.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.597
Bullshit.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.559
You're not a good father either.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.437
Even in this situation,

16:20.521 --> 16:24.400
you care more
about your pride than your child.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.779
How are you any different from me?

16:32.032 --> 16:35.077
How are you any different from me?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.621
How are you any different?

16:42.501 --> 16:44.128
You see, Ho-su is my son.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.549
And I'm supposed to keep him safe.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.885
But if I fail,

16:53.470 --> 16:57.349
I will show you
how you and I are different. You bastard.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.310

17:00.394 --> 17:03.480

-Where is he?
-You're just like me.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.235
-Calm down.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.388
Why are you here?

17:38.682 --> 17:39.808
Answer me.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.938
-Let go. Then we can talk.
-Answer me first.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.276
Did you find Ho-su? Is he all right?

17:49.985 --> 17:51.779
That's none of your concern--

17:53.989 --> 17:54.990
How did you know?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.867
Where is Ms. Jeong?

17:57.576 --> 17:59.119
I need to talk to her--

18:04.291 --> 18:07.002
You dare ask me again…

18:08.629 --> 18:10.172
about Hui-ju?

18:12.466 --> 18:13.550
"Again"?

18:22.267 --> 18:24.728
Sir, we need you to come in.

18:44.998 --> 18:48.585
Mr. Lee, tell me where you've been
since 11 a.m. on the 10th.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.464
We confirmed that
you kept trying to contact

18:52.548 --> 18:55.342
the victim's father for several days
before the kidnapping.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.803
Was there a reason behind these calls?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.181
Mr. Lee.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.308
Did you hold a grudge
about the demolition?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.310
-Is that why you planned this?
-I got it.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.647
Mr. Lee. As of this moment,

19:08.730 --> 19:11.441
I'm arresting you as a suspect,
not a person of interest.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.696
You have the right to defend yourself
and hire a lawyer.

19:15.779 --> 19:19.116
Wait. Why are you saying
I'm the only one who messed up here?

19:19.199 --> 19:21.869
He's the one who made a mistake
to begin with.

19:21.952 --> 19:25.497
Are there different sets of laws
for different people?

19:26.331 --> 19:29.042
You must pray to God
that my son comes back safely.

19:29.626 --> 19:30.669
Take him away.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.382
Sir, I'll compensate you for everything.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.009
I'll do whatever you want.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.304
Please tell me where Ho-su is.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.471
I don't know.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.224
I'm begging you.
Please tell me where he is.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.643
Tell me where he is.
I'll do everything you ask.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.812
I swear to you. I'll do anything.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.148
-I really don't know.
-Sir, please.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.233
-Let's go.
-Sir.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.234
Sir.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.533
You need to explain to me

20:01.617 --> 20:03.911
why you are here at this exact moment.

20:03.994 --> 20:08.207
There's no way that dumb man
planned the whole thing by himself.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.835
Hae-won made him do it.
Hae-won is behind this!

20:11.919 --> 20:13.337
You knew, didn't you?

20:13.420 --> 20:16.632
You said you'd go see her.
Why are you here? What did she say?

20:16.715 --> 20:18.425
I'll look for your son too.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.968
I'll ask Hae-won.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.805
I'm worried about him too.
Please believe me.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.478
The police will investigate this.
Why don't you…

20:30.103 --> 20:31.813
You told me!

20:31.897 --> 20:33.941
You said Hae-won has been coming here!

20:34.024 --> 20:36.235
You said people like them
tend to get attached

20:36.318 --> 20:38.695
to teachers who give them attention.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.198
What about our son? I'm so sorry to Ho-su!

20:41.281 --> 20:44.534
Do something! Find Ho-su!
How am I going to find him?

20:44.618 --> 20:47.788
I feel so awful for him. Ho-su!

20:49.081 --> 20:52.000
How can I just wait?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.137
Are you cold?

21:08.976 --> 21:12.396
You're all right now.
The bad man isn't here anymore.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.818
Your clothes got dirty.
Let's throw them out.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.447
How they got dirty will be our secret.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.868
Even I make mistakes when I'm scared.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.121
Do you want to get dressed?

21:38.672 --> 21:39.756
All good.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.327
You're right on time.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.537
What are you…

22:15.250 --> 22:18.420
-What are you doing?
-That's what I should ask you.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.547
Do you know what's going on right now?

22:22.257 --> 22:24.676
She just couldn't be patient.
I guess she called you.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.802
Hae-won!

22:28.847 --> 22:31.349
It's all right. He's not a scary man.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.022
He's already scared.
You're scaring him more.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.448
I'm sorry. Ho-su, you remember me. Right?

22:46.948 --> 22:48.283
We met at the ballpark.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.162
Let's go home. Your parents are worried.

22:54.081 --> 22:54.915
Okay?

23:06.551 --> 23:07.552
Ho-su.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.764
Happy birthday.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.508
Who was it?

23:51.888 --> 23:53.014
Spit it out.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.685
The demolition process began

23:57.811 --> 24:00.063
at the building where the gallery will be.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.190
And a tenant held a grudge for it.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.485
Those lowlifes.

24:06.736 --> 24:07.863
What about Ho-su?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.158
-No news yet.
-What about Hyeon-seong?

24:13.285 --> 24:15.078
He's stopping by the police station.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.338
JU-YEONG

24:25.422 --> 24:26.756
<i>Where are you?</i>

24:26.840 --> 24:30.051
<i>Your father got arrested
for kidnapping my brother.</i>

24:30.135 --> 24:32.888
<i>Has he gone mad? Where is my brother?</i>

24:34.806 --> 24:36.183
<i>Why are you asking me that?</i>

24:39.561 --> 24:41.605
<i>Have you gone mad too? He's your dad.</i>

24:44.858 --> 24:46.568
<i>Hey, answer me.</i>

24:47.736 --> 24:49.613
<i>What, are you in on it with him?</i>

24:55.911 --> 24:56.953
You're Ju-yeong, right?

24:58.121 --> 24:59.497
Hello.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.832
Do you want <i>tteokbokki</i>?

25:03.084 --> 25:03.919
Yes.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.921
Good. I wanted fritters and <i>sundae</i> too.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.923
I'll order everything then.

25:08.506 --> 25:10.425
Let's order four fried seaweed rolls.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.539
Ho-su!

25:43.041 --> 25:44.793
Ho-su.

25:45.752 --> 25:46.878
Ho-su.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.259
Children are open books.

25:52.968 --> 25:56.054
They always follow their instincts
and act accordingly.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.268
It's only been half a day.
But wasn't it awful?

26:02.644 --> 26:04.020
I know how it feels.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.523
How it feels to lose someone.

26:07.732 --> 26:08.733
Do you?

26:10.402 --> 26:11.945
What do you know?

26:17.784 --> 26:19.744
I'm glad that your son is all right.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.955
I said I would help you.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.331
Shut up.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.335
Ho-su. Let me look at you.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.547
My goodness. Ho-su.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.924
Explain this to me.

26:33.008 --> 26:37.637
I begged Mr. Lee to do the right thing
because Ho-su didn't do anything wrong.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.264
Shut your mouth!

26:44.602 --> 26:46.438
Ho-su wasn't there at the billiard hall.

26:46.521 --> 26:49.190
It means that
you took him before I got there.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.067
After leaving the police station,

26:51.151 --> 26:53.278
I went to see Mr. Lee right away.

26:53.862 --> 26:57.449
He was upset when they suddenly began
demolishing the building. So I wondered--

26:57.532 --> 27:00.160
Then shouldn't you
have called us or the police first?

27:05.790 --> 27:07.208
Mother.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.337
-Mother. Ho-su…
-Let's go, Ho-su.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.464
Mother.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.300
Mother.

27:17.677 --> 27:20.972
What happened? She said
she couldn't reach the two of you.

27:22.515 --> 27:24.851
Ms. Gu called us
to tell us she'd found Ho-su.

27:31.858 --> 27:35.028
I told you,
you should've answered your phone.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.323
I'm sorry.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.241
Why are you sorry?

27:41.534 --> 27:43.578
We shouldn't be apologizing.

27:43.661 --> 27:45.747
Those people should be thanking us.

27:46.539 --> 27:50.377
Go home. It's late. Let's talk about this
at the police station tomorrow.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.309
Gosh.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.984
What are you doing?

28:16.653 --> 28:18.655
These aren't the clothes I put on him.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.329
Ho-su…

28:28.581 --> 28:31.876
Those two outside.
Who are they involved with?

28:32.544 --> 28:35.004
You or her?

28:47.934 --> 28:51.104
Explain this to me.
I can't just let this slide.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.939
But it's none of your concern.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.233
How could you do that?

28:55.316 --> 28:58.737
A man who held a grudge against them
used their son with bad intentions.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.157
Luckily, that boy's back home safely.

29:03.324 --> 29:07.120
As for the ruined birthday party,
he'll have many years to do it over.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.083
Many kids die without celebrating
their birthdays even once.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.378
All right?

29:15.462 --> 29:17.046
This isn't that simple.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.800
"Simple"? How is any of this simple?

29:20.884 --> 29:22.051
"Luckily"?

29:22.135 --> 29:25.096
Have you thought about his family
who was worried sick all day?

29:25.180 --> 29:27.015
It's their burden to carry.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.102
And you're not their family. You're mine.

29:35.231 --> 29:37.150
I'm leaving. I need to stop by somewhere.

30:10.183 --> 30:14.103
I thought all the trouble
I went through as a kid made me tough.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.440
That's how I accepted it

30:18.149 --> 30:20.151
because I couldn't help it.

30:22.195 --> 30:24.614
But I don't have to go through it here.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.951
We can easily
avoid everything bad. But why…

30:29.452 --> 30:30.578
I'm scared.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.582
If I had to give up my limbs
to keep him safe, I would do it.

30:37.043 --> 30:41.422
I'm so scared that my kids might
get hurt because of me.

31:24.465 --> 31:25.633
Where's my mom?

31:27.093 --> 31:29.387
She went out after a phone call.

31:30.471 --> 31:31.931
She's not back yet?

31:32.015 --> 31:33.266
She'll be back.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.021
Ms. Gu.

31:38.938 --> 31:42.692
Did Li-sa's brother go home?

31:42.775 --> 31:44.986
Yes. He did.

31:46.863 --> 31:47.989
That's good.

31:49.657 --> 31:50.992
What about my dad?

31:57.081 --> 31:58.833
Don't go to the billiard hall again.

31:59.626 --> 32:00.960
It's too dangerous there now.

32:02.378 --> 32:03.254
Okay.

32:04.088 --> 32:04.923
Right.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.677
I signed it.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.684
PETITION FOR GUARDIANSHIP OF A MINOR

32:16.768 --> 32:20.021
AS THE MINOR HAS NO OTHER FAMILY,
APPOINT THE PETITIONER AS A GUARDIAN

32:20.104 --> 32:22.065
PETITIONER: GU HAE-WON
MINOR: LEE JU-YEONG

32:24.108 --> 32:25.485
Are you sure about this?

32:28.196 --> 32:29.322
Probably.

32:29.822 --> 32:31.407
This is not the time to act tough.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.243
It's really important.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.996
It can determine your future.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.582
I know.

32:40.541 --> 32:43.503
It was scary to live alone
while my dad was away.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.798
But oddly enough, I wasn't anxious.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.425
It was more comfortable.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.513
I'll pretend I don't have a father.

32:59.727 --> 33:02.063
-Ju-yeong.
-Without the recent events,

33:03.606 --> 33:06.192
I wouldn't have even known
that my mother was dead.

33:09.570 --> 33:11.739
He wronged me too.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.910
He lied about how
she abandoned me and left home.

33:17.704 --> 33:20.248
He's responsible
for making me hate my mom.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.960
He ought to be punished for that.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.028
What are you doing still up?

33:50.111 --> 33:52.905
Grandma told me to throw them out
because they're bad luck.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.490
But I was curious.

34:01.497 --> 34:03.666
TO HUI-JU

34:12.341 --> 34:14.260
What's this? Did you open this?

34:14.844 --> 34:16.387
No. What is it?

34:19.223 --> 34:21.684
TO HUI-JU

34:39.035 --> 34:40.453
Did the man

34:41.788 --> 34:44.457
take you like this?

34:46.834 --> 34:47.752
Yes.

34:48.336 --> 34:49.712
And did the man

34:50.797 --> 34:52.090
tie your hands like this?

34:54.008 --> 34:54.842
Yes.

34:55.468 --> 34:57.428
You must have been frustrated.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.056
But you were a brave boy.

35:03.768 --> 35:06.687
Have you always been close to this lady?

35:08.523 --> 35:10.900
She and I are close.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.276
Did she say

35:12.360 --> 35:15.571
any mean things to you
or do bad things to you?

35:16.739 --> 35:19.283
She's not a bad person.

35:23.955 --> 35:27.041
Hui-ju, are you all right?

35:27.625 --> 35:30.211
You didn't get any sleep, right?
You look tired. Sit here.

35:31.337 --> 35:32.672
Drink some warm water.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.217
-Here.
-Okay.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.933
What happened? Where's Hyeon-seong?

35:45.101 --> 35:48.479
I came alone because he had to stay
a bit longer to make a statement.

35:49.814 --> 35:50.982
What about Mr. Seo?

35:52.108 --> 35:54.110
Didn't Mr. Seo
and his wife bring him home?

35:54.735 --> 35:57.488
Strangers found him
when his parents and the police couldn't?

35:58.406 --> 35:59.907
Isn't that more suspicious?

36:02.034 --> 36:04.162
Without Lee Il-seong's testimony,

36:04.829 --> 36:06.414
it's hard to prove her connection.

36:07.415 --> 36:10.084
And even if he claims
she instigated the whole thing

36:10.168 --> 36:12.128
and she's an accomplice,

36:12.211 --> 36:14.505
it will be a groundless claim
without any evidence.

36:14.589 --> 36:15.840
On top of that…

36:20.219 --> 36:22.763
<i>What have you done, Mr. Lee?</i>

36:23.723 --> 36:26.934
This is the recording file
Ms. Gu submitted to the police today.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.061
He's become a suspect

36:29.145 --> 36:32.481
in another criminal case
while his criminal case is still ongoing.

36:33.065 --> 36:34.609
So he'll face a heavier sentence.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.574
<i>That jerk is not answering my calls.</i>

36:42.074 --> 36:43.618
<i>He's not answering.</i>

36:43.701 --> 36:46.204
<i>He still won't answer my calls.</i>

36:46.704 --> 36:49.540
<i>Still, you can't just take his son.</i>

36:51.959 --> 36:53.169
Ms. Gu.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.880
You've made a terrible mistake.

36:56.672 --> 36:58.799
I told you to go meet with him.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.010
I never told you to take his son.

37:01.093 --> 37:04.805
But I was… What happened was…

37:04.889 --> 37:08.476
He didn't see your face, did he?

37:08.559 --> 37:09.393
What?

37:10.311 --> 37:13.105
No. With that thing you gave me
the other day--

37:13.189 --> 37:14.523
That's a relief.

37:15.274 --> 37:18.027
You should stop dragging
his son into this matter.

37:18.110 --> 37:21.113
And you should make
your demands clear to Mr. An.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.909
After all, the school is
the cause of all this.

37:30.873 --> 37:33.501
Those people will use
this incident as a chance

37:33.584 --> 37:36.254
to ruin your life,
so you can never go against them again.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.839
And they'll even use Ju-yeong to do that.

37:38.923 --> 37:43.469
What? Then why wouldn't I do
the same to them?

37:43.552 --> 37:45.721
They ruined my family!

37:45.805 --> 37:47.556
They ought to feel what it's like too.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.601
They'll sell anything for money.
So they'll realize their mistake

37:50.685 --> 37:52.728
once their son is sold off somewhere too!

37:56.941 --> 37:57.942
Damn it.

37:59.443 --> 38:02.571
I can understand your desperation.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.618
No one's tried
to listen to your side of the story.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.871
That's why
you must have made this decision.

38:12.039 --> 38:14.583
You know, I wasn't going to…

38:15.167 --> 38:17.837
I didn't want to take things this far.
You know that.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.298
Of course.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.552
You didn't want the boy
to get hurt either. Right?

38:26.929 --> 38:28.889
Even if things don't work out for you,

38:28.973 --> 38:32.935
I'll make sure you get
the compensation money you want.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.479
Trust me.

38:41.068 --> 38:44.405
Where is the boy now?

38:46.657 --> 38:48.659
<i>Don't be a monster who steals a child</i>

38:48.743 --> 38:53.164
<i>from his parents. Don't steal
the most important thing in their world.</i>

38:58.169 --> 39:00.379
You're all right.

39:01.547 --> 39:02.631
You're okay.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.050
YOU CAN OWN A TOWNHOUSE TOO!
PROPERTY SALE AGREEMENT

39:04.133 --> 39:06.135
So did you think about it?

39:06.218 --> 39:10.097
There's only one unit left.
I just don't want you to lose your chance.

39:15.311 --> 39:19.648
I see. Okay. I'll hold it until tomorrow.

39:19.732 --> 39:23.527
Then I'll call you tomorrow again. Bye.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.239
Jeong-yeon.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.450
Who's that?

39:33.162 --> 39:37.249
She's a student Hae-won used to teach.
She wants me to look after her.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.668
She's a student.
She should be at school now.

39:39.752 --> 39:43.506
I don't know.
I'm sure there's a good reason for it.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.218
What's that?

39:48.928 --> 39:53.182
Right! I didn't tell you about this.

39:54.683 --> 39:57.353
I used the deposit from my house
to buy land there.

39:57.436 --> 39:59.522
The price went up tenfold in the last run.

40:00.189 --> 40:03.359
You can invest with as little
as 30 million won. But for you …

40:04.151 --> 40:04.985
No.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.280
Never mind.

40:09.448 --> 40:10.324
Why not?

40:10.991 --> 40:13.661
I have money too.
You said it went up tenfold.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.541
Let me try it out first.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.751
If it doesn't work out,
Hae-won will scold me.

40:25.297 --> 40:28.676
Yes, ma'am. Did you think about it?

40:29.510 --> 40:33.264
Of course. You saw my contract too.

40:33.806 --> 40:34.807
Yes.

40:36.016 --> 40:38.060
TO HUI-JU

40:38.144 --> 40:39.228
You left this, right?

40:39.854 --> 40:42.731
I doubt that you gave me
an empty envelope. What's this about?

40:44.817 --> 40:47.194
You didn't see what was inside? Why not?

40:54.243 --> 40:55.619
I asked what was inside.

40:57.079 --> 40:59.206
You'll be in trouble
if someone else sees it.

41:02.918 --> 41:04.462
Answer my question.

41:21.103 --> 41:23.689
When they returned Woo-jae's belongings,

41:23.772 --> 41:25.649
there was only a single photo.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.546
I think it looked something like this.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.057
Do you recognize it?

42:07.233 --> 42:10.528
When I saw that photo, I wondered…

42:12.947 --> 42:14.532
if you went together,

42:15.950 --> 42:17.618
if you ran into each other there…

42:19.828 --> 42:23.457
and who that baby was.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.131
After guessing what happened,
I tried to understand you two.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.011
I told myself that
you wouldn't do that to me…

42:38.305 --> 42:40.307
because I really liked you.

42:41.517 --> 42:44.478
The thought that you might die
before me because you're older,

42:46.355 --> 42:48.691
and the thought
of living my life without you…

42:50.901 --> 42:53.904
was enough to make me sad.

42:58.993 --> 43:02.037
But now I think,
"She'll probably die before me."

43:02.121 --> 43:03.581
"It's such a big relief."

43:05.457 --> 43:07.084
I have those thoughts now.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.092
I know what you're imagining.

43:16.677 --> 43:18.220
But you are wrong.

43:19.054 --> 43:21.265
Ho-su is my husband's son.

43:23.392 --> 43:24.810
I didn't go there with Woo-jae.

43:24.893 --> 43:28.022
-We just ran into--
-I don't want to hear your excuses.

43:29.732 --> 43:33.777
I only need to watch
your life getting ruined.

43:36.905 --> 43:39.825
I will not break down like you.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.126
I've seen a lot of people like you.

43:49.627 --> 43:53.047
People who destroy themselves
because of their victim mentality.

43:53.130 --> 43:57.426
They need to rationalize their misfortune,
so they slander other people.

43:57.509 --> 44:01.555
And these pathetic people do everything
to make everyone miserable like them.

44:02.139 --> 44:03.557
And you're one of them.

44:04.516 --> 44:07.603
That's why you even
dragged a little child into this.

44:08.312 --> 44:12.524
You weaseled your way out of this
after turning a father into a criminal.

44:15.361 --> 44:16.737
You're the monster.

44:20.449 --> 44:22.993
Everyone will be sick of you
and leave you.

44:24.370 --> 44:27.456
You will live a lonely life
in suffering. Not me.

44:33.295 --> 44:35.130
Seeing how you're very chatty,

44:36.298 --> 44:38.342
you must be very anxious right now.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.137
I guess I was right.

44:50.729 --> 44:52.189
If I'm a monster,

44:52.856 --> 44:54.983
what are the people who made me this way?

45:00.614 --> 45:02.908
I wonder who saw the photo I sent you.

45:04.076 --> 45:06.412
If you find out, let me know too.

45:21.009 --> 45:24.012
TO HUI-JU

45:32.020 --> 45:34.273
<i>I wonder who saw the photo I sent you.</i>

45:46.452 --> 45:48.287
This is Unit D.

45:48.370 --> 45:50.456
I want to check the surveillance footage.

45:55.169 --> 45:58.255
<i>We didn't install any cameras
at the front door for privacy reasons.</i>

45:58.338 --> 46:00.257
<i>You can only check the one in the alley.</i>

46:32.873 --> 46:33.707
Why are you here?

46:34.208 --> 46:36.001
I'm worried about you being alone here.

46:37.419 --> 46:39.296
I don't feel good about it.

46:39.379 --> 46:40.797
You're not worried about me.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.884
You're worried about what I might do.

47:04.404 --> 47:06.031
You know, Ho-su's dad…

47:08.200 --> 47:10.452
reads Ho-su a lot of children's books.

47:11.912 --> 47:14.081
But they are different
from the stories I knew.

47:14.873 --> 47:18.210
Hansel and Gretel's father and stepmom
rescue them in the new story.

47:19.336 --> 47:20.712
And the three little pigs

47:20.796 --> 47:23.507
make up with the wolf
and even build him a nice house.

47:25.300 --> 47:26.552
It's ridiculous.

47:27.135 --> 47:30.472
"When people do something wrong,
they pay dearly for it."

47:30.556 --> 47:32.641
Wouldn't teaching that be more helpful?

47:36.270 --> 47:39.147
If they grew up only listening
to unrealistic happy endings,

47:40.899 --> 47:42.609
wouldn't they be disappointed?

47:46.822 --> 47:49.366
Kids should also know how cruel and harsh

47:50.492 --> 47:52.327
this world is.

47:52.953 --> 47:54.955
Why have you become so twisted?

48:02.004 --> 48:03.755
I'm sure Ho-su learned it too.

48:04.798 --> 48:07.384
That there are adults
who use and hurt kids.

48:11.888 --> 48:13.724
And he shouldn't trust just anyone.

48:27.195 --> 48:28.572
What on earth

48:29.740 --> 48:31.450
have I done to you?

48:50.677 --> 48:53.347
Are you a dummy?
Why did you follow a stranger?

48:53.430 --> 48:57.100
He wasn't a stranger. He was Dracula.

48:58.602 --> 49:00.604
And I'm not a dummy either.

49:00.687 --> 49:02.314
That's right. Ho-su isn't a dummy.

49:03.940 --> 49:06.318
But you should be more careful next time.

49:06.985 --> 49:09.071
You shouldn't follow people like that

49:09.154 --> 49:11.531
when we're not there
even if you think you know them.

49:13.367 --> 49:15.160
I heard Ms. Gu found you.

49:15.243 --> 49:16.953
How? What did she say to you?

49:17.037 --> 49:18.872
If you're done eating, go upstairs.

49:20.082 --> 49:22.292
Why? I'm curious.

49:23.001 --> 49:24.044
Go upstairs.

49:25.754 --> 49:28.340
Are you serious?
I can't even ask a question?

49:33.970 --> 49:38.016
Ho-su, if you're done, go up and brush
your teeth. Then I'll read you a story.

49:47.651 --> 49:49.277
Like Li-sa said,

49:50.320 --> 49:52.781
we should ask Ho-su what happened first.

49:52.864 --> 49:54.783
I don't want to make it worse for him.

49:56.201 --> 49:58.954
He's seeing a therapist tomorrow.
Leave it to the expert.

49:59.037 --> 50:01.581
-But still.
-Ho-su is still young

50:01.665 --> 50:03.166
He might be able to forget.

50:05.001 --> 50:07.003
We don't have to force him to remember.

50:10.090 --> 50:11.133
Okay.

50:15.762 --> 50:20.642
Did you put away
the birthday presents for Ho-su?

50:20.726 --> 50:23.854
No. Why are you suddenly asking me that?

50:23.937 --> 50:27.607
I'm giving out party favors.
I want to make sure I got everyone.

50:37.534 --> 50:40.370
TAERIM HOSPITAL

50:46.001 --> 50:48.587
Ho-su, should we use this color?

50:50.630 --> 50:52.758
-Here?
-Yes, there.

50:53.842 --> 50:56.970
I don't think
I've ever tried to be a good mother.

50:57.596 --> 51:00.265
I didn't want your mother
to find fault with me.

51:01.683 --> 51:05.520
I didn't want people to say I paint
as a hobby because I met a rich husband.

51:05.604 --> 51:07.272
So I tried so hard to be good.

51:09.483 --> 51:13.111
Is it because I didn't have a good mother?

51:17.491 --> 51:22.037
From time to time,
I even got jealous of my own children

51:23.038 --> 51:26.249
because I pitied myself
for not having any opportunities as a kid.

51:30.587 --> 51:35.717
And there were times when I took
Li-sa and Ho-su's hardships lightly.

51:39.429 --> 51:43.433
Do you think the children realized it?

51:45.310 --> 51:48.563
That I'm a horrible mother?

51:52.901 --> 51:55.070
No parent is perfect.

51:59.491 --> 52:01.201
I don't have to be perfect.

52:02.786 --> 52:05.831
But I didn't want to be a mother
who hurt her own child.

52:10.210 --> 52:11.586
Please,

52:13.088 --> 52:14.673
keep Ho-su safe.

52:21.513 --> 52:22.889
Go and get some fresh air.

52:23.723 --> 52:25.100
I'll watch him.

52:26.768 --> 52:27.769
Okay.

53:04.931 --> 53:06.725
<i>My goodness. That's a great drawing.</i>

53:07.601 --> 53:10.228
-Oh, my. Did you draw that, Ho-su?
-Yes.

53:10.312 --> 53:12.230
Gosh. You're so good!

53:12.314 --> 53:15.942
Where did you get this crazy talent?
Seriously.

53:16.026 --> 53:18.862
I brought a present for you. Ta-da.

53:18.945 --> 53:22.490
It's your favorite candy. Here.

53:24.576 --> 53:25.911
Don't tell your mom.

53:27.621 --> 53:28.455
Where's Hui-ju?

53:29.080 --> 53:30.665
She went out for some air.

53:31.291 --> 53:32.792
She's stressed out lately.

53:32.876 --> 53:35.086
Ho-su, let's go to your grandma.

53:35.587 --> 53:37.881
Hui-ju is coming too? I'll go with you.

53:38.924 --> 53:41.968
Let's go! Uncle will take you there!

53:47.682 --> 53:49.142
Take this.

53:49.225 --> 53:52.270
I just want to thank you
for bringing him home safe and sound.

53:52.771 --> 53:55.357
I didn't do anything to deserve a reward.

53:58.401 --> 54:01.571
Why don't we buy a few of his pieces?
Ask Ms. Lee about it.

54:02.197 --> 54:04.157
-Sure.
-I'm sorry.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.951
I'm not selling any of my pieces yet.

54:06.534 --> 54:09.162
What do you mean? We already bought one.

54:10.330 --> 54:11.456
Pardon?

54:11.539 --> 54:15.543
My daughter-in-law already
bought one of your pieces.

54:15.627 --> 54:16.586
Didn't you know?

54:21.091 --> 54:24.052
I heard that the buyer
wanted to be anonymous.

54:26.012 --> 54:28.890
Is that so? I wonder why she said that.

54:39.526 --> 54:40.485
I'll be off, then.

55:15.937 --> 55:17.272
Is Ho-su all right?

55:17.355 --> 55:19.149
Why were you with the Chief Director?

55:23.611 --> 55:26.197
-You--
-What did you tell my mother-in-law?

55:26.281 --> 55:30.118
She wanted to pay me a reward
to thank me for bringing back Ho-su.

55:32.579 --> 55:34.247
I turned it down. That's all.

55:35.331 --> 55:37.292
<i>He came back to Korea recently?</i>

55:37.375 --> 55:41.171
He was in an accident in Ireland,
so he was in the hospital for years.

55:41.254 --> 55:42.130
And Mr. An…

55:43.923 --> 55:45.383
paid for the medical bills.

55:45.467 --> 55:48.178
Didn't Hyeon-seong start going to Ireland

55:48.261 --> 55:49.721
to see Hui-ju?

55:49.804 --> 55:53.183
Yes. For about three years,

55:53.266 --> 55:57.353
Hui-ju and Mr. Seo
were in Ireland at the same time.

56:00.315 --> 56:01.441
Do you think…

56:02.901 --> 56:05.945
I don't want your opinion.
Look into it and get me the facts.

56:06.654 --> 56:07.489
Yes, ma'am.

56:09.074 --> 56:10.617
Grandma!

56:10.700 --> 56:14.329
Goodness. My baby.

56:15.246 --> 56:16.623
Did you come to see me?

56:20.376 --> 56:22.087
I guess someone else was here.

56:22.170 --> 56:24.672
Ho-su, what would you like to eat?

56:24.756 --> 56:28.093
I should cook you
a nice birthday meal tomorrow morning.

56:28.676 --> 56:30.345
What do you want to eat?

56:30.428 --> 56:33.598
-Ice cream.
-Ice cream?

56:34.349 --> 56:36.101
What about the photo?

56:36.184 --> 56:37.393
What photo?

56:37.477 --> 56:40.105
The one you took!
Why did you have to take that?

56:40.188 --> 56:41.856
What photo are you talking about?

56:46.569 --> 56:47.821
Hae-won…

56:49.489 --> 56:51.241
didn't say anything to you?

56:51.324 --> 56:54.452
It feels shitty to be this clueless fool,
stuck between you two.

56:55.537 --> 57:00.458
Both of you won't explain anything to me
but keep putting it on me.

57:03.044 --> 57:05.130
What am I supposed to do then?

57:08.091 --> 57:11.302
Never mind if you don't know.
Actually, it's better that you don't.

57:11.386 --> 57:15.223
No. I hate it
when you make me feel like a big idiot.

57:16.850 --> 57:18.184
I can't stand it anymore.

57:20.228 --> 57:21.729
What then?

57:23.356 --> 57:24.816
You said it was brief. Right?

57:27.068 --> 57:29.195
You said it was brief and casual.

57:32.073 --> 57:34.033
Why are you so anxious then?

57:41.291 --> 57:42.834
I knew you wouldn't answer me.

57:44.544 --> 57:46.629
I have to remember it, don't I?

57:48.006 --> 57:49.799
I'll remember it no matter what.

57:50.758 --> 57:52.051
I will get back

57:53.678 --> 57:54.929
my memories on my own.

57:59.642 --> 58:01.769
Your husband knows.

58:03.396 --> 58:06.274
You dare ask me again…

58:07.692 --> 58:09.068
about Hui-ju?

58:10.069 --> 58:11.446
<i>I'm sure he knows</i>

58:11.529 --> 58:13.615
that I loved you

58:13.698 --> 58:15.492
and probably about our affair too.

58:20.997 --> 58:22.665
It seems you two also have many secrets.

59:07.335 --> 59:09.504
What are you doing here?
You didn't pick up my call.

59:11.673 --> 59:12.757
Well…

59:13.841 --> 59:15.552
Is it over? Where's Ho-su?

59:15.635 --> 59:17.845
He must've been tired.
He fell asleep soon after.

59:17.929 --> 59:19.681
My mom didn't want to disturb his nap.

59:19.764 --> 59:21.849
She'll send him home
after feeding him dinner.

59:24.102 --> 59:25.395
That's good.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.691
-Are you going back to school?
-Yes, I am.

59:29.774 --> 59:31.109
You were here the whole time?

59:33.486 --> 59:34.487
Yes.

59:37.282 --> 59:39.200
I'll go home first then.

1:01:43.408 --> 1:01:45.243
What brings you here at this late hour?

1:01:51.374 --> 1:01:53.084
I'm the only one here.

1:01:53.626 --> 1:01:55.628
I don't think you're here to see me.

1:01:57.046 --> 1:01:58.715
Seo Woo-jae…

1:01:59.382 --> 1:02:00.633
Seo Woo-jae…

1:02:01.342 --> 1:02:02.593
Where is he?

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:10.393
Are you looking for Woo-jae

1:02:10.977 --> 1:02:13.312
or Hui-ju?

1:02:17.233 --> 1:02:19.777
Seriously? You acted like
the most understanding husband.

1:02:25.616 --> 1:02:27.285
I guess you were in a rush.

1:02:34.667 --> 1:02:37.086
Now you look like someone I can relate to.

1:02:37.587 --> 1:02:39.005
Wait.

1:02:40.006 --> 1:02:43.217
I can understand what
you're going through more than anyone.

1:02:49.056 --> 1:02:50.850
That's where Woo-jae is.

1:02:51.809 --> 1:02:54.353
I don't know who's there with him, though.

1:03:01.194 --> 1:03:02.528
MS. GU HAE-WON

1:03:02.612 --> 1:03:06.157
People tend to ignore that feeling
when something bad is going to happen.

1:03:06.657 --> 1:03:09.076
I get that they don't want to believe it

1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:11.871
and want to pretend that nothing's wrong,

1:03:11.954 --> 1:03:14.999
but choosing to ignore it
won't make it go away.

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:20.296
You should go and see it for yourself.

1:03:23.925 --> 1:03:28.137
See if you can pretend to be fine
even after seeing it with your own eyes.

1:03:29.388 --> 1:03:30.765
I'm curious to find out too.

1:04:00.378 --> 1:04:03.589
MS. GU HAE-WON

1:04:05.550 --> 1:04:09.929
WOO-JAE

1:04:16.269 --> 1:04:18.896
14, UNJEONGDONG-RO, GANGBUK-GU

1:04:50.761 --> 1:04:52.805
<i>You should go and see it for yourself.</i>

1:04:53.639 --> 1:04:57.977
<i>See if you can pretend to be fine
even after seeing it with your own eyes.</i>

1:04:59.353 --> 1:05:00.813
I'm curious to find out too.

1:06:36.909 --> 1:06:38.953
TO HUI-JU

1:07:27.501 --> 1:07:28.878
Where were you?

1:07:31.297 --> 1:07:32.757
What time is it?

1:07:33.841 --> 1:07:35.092
Where were you?

1:07:36.093 --> 1:07:37.136
What?

1:07:37.219 --> 1:07:41.098
Where did you go late at night?
Where did you go? Who did you see?

1:07:42.683 --> 1:07:44.143
I didn't go anywhere.

1:07:44.226 --> 1:07:45.352
Answer me.

1:07:55.488 --> 1:07:56.781
Where are you going again?

1:07:57.323 --> 1:07:58.949
I'm not going anywhere.

1:07:59.033 --> 1:08:00.201
Just say something.

1:08:01.327 --> 1:08:03.954
-Say what?
-Lie if you have to!

1:08:24.266 --> 1:08:25.851
I'd rather have you lie to me.

1:08:25.935 --> 1:08:29.271
That's the least you can do for me!

1:08:48.082 --> 1:08:51.544
TO HUI-JU

1:08:59.635 --> 1:09:03.764
RECORDING

1:09:19.321 --> 1:09:21.866
<i>Are you back together with Woo-jae?</i>

1:09:21.949 --> 1:09:24.118
<i>I'll do as you say.</i>

1:09:24.201 --> 1:09:25.578
I'll leave.

1:09:25.661 --> 1:09:27.538
<i>Running away again?</i>

1:09:27.621 --> 1:09:29.748
Did you sleep with that bastard? Tell me!

1:09:29.832 --> 1:09:31.375
Do you still love him?

1:09:31.458 --> 1:09:35.004
<i>You just got divorced.</i>

1:09:35.588 --> 1:09:37.423
What if I kill her?

1:09:37.506 --> 1:09:39.466
<i>Do you want me to break up with you?</i>

1:09:39.550 --> 1:09:41.051
<i>Why did we break up?</i>

1:09:41.135 --> 1:09:44.513
<i>If I could turn back time,
I'd do it at all costs.</i>

1:09:44.597 --> 1:09:47.057
<i>Ho-su, open up.</i>

1:09:47.141 --> 1:09:48.642
<i>I'm going to remember.</i>

1:09:48.726 --> 1:09:50.644
<i>No matter how painful the memories are,</i>

1:09:52.062 --> 1:09:53.480
<i>I'll recover them.</i>

1:09:53.564 --> 1:09:54.690
Jeong Hui-ju.

1:09:57.151 --> 1:09:58.569
<i>Jeong Hui-ju!</i>
