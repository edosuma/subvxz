14:34.506 --> 14:35.840
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

14:35.842 --> 14:37.508
Your droid trusts me.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.544
Yeah, that's not
a good thing.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.546
Fine. You wanna
help us so badly?

14:41.548 --> 14:44.482
We need to get a signal
to our friends.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.451
Then we'll have to
move quickly.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.489
Watch out. They're rebels!

14:51.924 --> 14:53.324
(GRUNTS)

14:58.430 --> 15:00.098
(GROANS)

15:00.100 --> 15:02.433
You could've warned me
you were going to do that.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.168
Where's the fun in that?

15:04.170 --> 15:07.505
Your droid can open
your comlinks from this port.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.507
I'll provide
the access codes.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.509
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

15:11.511 --> 15:13.411
He doesn't need them?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.513
This C1 of yours
is quite efficient.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.515
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

15:17.517 --> 15:20.451
Figures Chop'd get along
with an Imperial spy.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.553
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

15:22.555 --> 15:25.890
(COMLINK CHIMES) Ryder, it's Kanan. You
there? RYDER:<i> Closer than you think.</i>

15:25.892 --> 15:30.428
<i>We're about to hit</i>
<i>the east gate,</i>
<i>give you a chance to escape.</i>

15:30.430 --> 15:32.196
<i>You'll need to move</i>
<i>if you want to make it out.</i>

15:32.198 --> 15:34.299
We will. And thanks.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.100
Make for
the east vehicle pool.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.536
You'll find a walker there
you can escape in.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.572
Now, I just have to
make this look convincing.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.541
Okay.
(YELPS)

15:44.476 --> 15:48.079
Ezra!
What? That is convincing.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.081
Yeah, but I was
gonna do it.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.483
EZRA: Well,
if he's one of us now,
you'll get your chance.

15:52.485 --> 15:53.851
(GROANS)

15:54.586 --> 15:56.487
(BEEPING)

15:56.489 --> 16:00.558
An unlicensed droid
accessed the computer
in section A-2.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.262
I can only assume that
they have acquired my plans.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.497
But something has changed.

16:06.499 --> 16:10.668
The rebels should have
attempted to escape
via the factory by now.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.271
Maybe they realize
they're trapped.

16:13.273 --> 16:17.075
More likely they have found
an unexpected ally.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.511
Or perhaps
an expected one.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.514
I'm not sure I follow.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.284
The rebels will attempt
a different means of escape.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.286
And we must adapt
our strategy accordingly.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.321
(CONSOLE CHIMES)

16:30.323 --> 16:32.690
LYSTE:<i> Grand Admiral, there</i>
<i>is a small band of rebels</i>

16:32.692 --> 16:34.659
<i>attacking the east gate.</i>

16:34.661 --> 16:38.196
I've deployed two AT-ATs.
Should I send backup?

16:38.198 --> 16:41.532
<i>Yes, Lieutenant.</i>
<i>Let's play their game.</i>

16:41.534 --> 16:42.700
LYSTE:
<i>Deploying walkers now.</i>

16:42.702 --> 16:44.602
You hear that?
We'll fit right in.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.371
I hope this is one of
the good walkers.

17:05.124 --> 17:08.059
AT-DP-216,
what are you doing here?

17:08.061 --> 17:09.727
<i>You're not part</i>
<i>of this operation.</i>

17:09.729 --> 17:12.397
Uh, we're your
reinforcements.

17:12.399 --> 17:16.067
THRAWN:<i> Attention, walkers.</i>
<i>Disregard the speeders.</i>

17:16.069 --> 17:19.637
That AT-DP is under
rebel control. Destroy it.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.710
Kallus set us up!

17:25.712 --> 17:28.846
Maybe, maybe not.
We'll figure it out later.
Now get to cover!

17:28.848 --> 17:30.615
Not a whole lot of
that around!

17:41.927 --> 17:44.228
RYDER: Now there's something
you don't see every day.

17:45.497 --> 17:46.764
That's gotta be Bridger.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.434
RYDER:<i> Kanan, Ezra.</i>
<i>Is that you?</i>

17:49.436 --> 17:51.135
Yes! And we could
use a pickup.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.441
Soon would be good!

17:56.443 --> 17:58.576
Walker 414,
blast them already!

18:00.913 --> 18:03.781
You're in my line
of fire, 271.
I can't get a shot.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.318
Let's crush them.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.438
They didn't have a chance.
(DOOR OPENS)

18:27.440 --> 18:30.641
We had a chance.
Pretty good chance.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.372
(LAUGHING)

19:07.646 --> 19:10.314
I don't believe it.
I thought you were
in the smaller one.

19:11.283 --> 19:12.917
This one's roomier.

19:14.319 --> 19:17.688
Sumar?
He didn't make it.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.529
More walkers incoming!

19:35.841 --> 19:39.710
I think I almost
got the data decrypted.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.013
Whoa.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.682
I've never seen
an Imperial fighter
like that.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.684
Sabine, talk to me.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.021
Looks like some new kind
of TIE interceptor,

19:50.023 --> 19:51.789
but this one has shields.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.692
But TIE fighters
never had shields before.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.861
Maybe that's why
it's so secret.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.664
If they're actually
building these in numbers,

19:59.666 --> 20:01.866
our pilots won't
stand a chance.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.734
<i>And neither will</i>
<i>the rebellion.</i>

20:03.736 --> 20:06.537
How'd you get past Thrawn
with these plans?

20:06.539 --> 20:08.673
Someone's losing
more than their job for that.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.675
<i>I guess we can thank</i>
<i>Agent Kallus.</i>

20:10.677 --> 20:12.376
<i>He knew Fulcrum's</i>
<i>secret code phrase.</i>

20:14.246 --> 20:16.881
Wait, wait, wait.
Kallus is Fulcrum?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.683
How does that even
make sense?

20:18.685 --> 20:22.520
Karabast.
I must've recruited him.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.689
You know, accidentally.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.925
<i>You mean when you were stuck</i>
<i>on that ice moon with him?</i>

20:27.927 --> 20:30.394
Yeah, well.
We didn't kill each other.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.664
So I guess we're friends now?

20:33.666 --> 20:36.400
Still, we'll use caution
with our new "friend"

20:36.402 --> 20:38.769
until we're sure we know
what game he's playing.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.242
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Dismissed.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.878
Agent Kallus,
I read your report.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.881
Several troopers
confirmed your encounter
with the Jedi.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.850
It was very helpful.

20:52.852 --> 20:56.254
You know, after analyzing
the rebels' escape,

20:56.256 --> 21:00.191
it's clear to me
they had help from one
within our Imperial ranks.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.261
The rebels have a mole?

21:03.263 --> 21:06.530
Then all personnel
must be interrogated.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.165
This spy must be found!

21:08.967 --> 21:10.468
Patience, Governor.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.771
Acting out of emotion
will not serve us here.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.574
We must wait and watch.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.777
And when we find our spy,
and we will find them,

21:19.779 --> 21:23.247
we shall turn them
from an obstacle to an asset.

21:23.249 --> 21:26.784
Wouldn't you agree,
Agent Kallus?

21:26.786 --> 21:30.988
Your strategy
is without flaw,
Grand Admiral.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.556
As always.
