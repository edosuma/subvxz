How long since you had human blood?

00:05.839 --> 00:08.132
Since I threatened to drive Elena
off the bridge.

I don't know. A tumor. Vascular anomalies.

Anything physical
that might explain his behavior.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.939
That it was Alaric
who was killing all of those people.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.109
It was after he told me about his ring.
I remembered a story...

01:09.319 --> 01:12.821
...my grandmother told me about
Samantha Gilbert and her secret journal.

I don't know if you know this,
but we Fells are notorious busybodies.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.620
But then why did you protect him?

01:21.664 --> 01:22.998
Because I'm a doctor.

01:23.208 --> 01:28.087
I don't like to see someone hurt
by something they have no control over.

01:29.422 --> 01:33.342
And because when he and I first met,
I felt like...

Well, everything is normal

The rings were made by a Bennett witch.

How could you just go out feeding with
Stefan like some vampire pub crawl?

03:44.682 --> 03:49.186
Right. I thought we were talking about
Alaric, but we're talking about Stefan.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.855
You stood there and let him feed
on an innocent girl.

03:52.065 --> 03:56.026
I didn't let him do anything. If you
wanna get nitpicky about it, I made him.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.277
Why would you do that?

03:57.487 --> 03:59.905
We're vampires.
We need human blood to survive.

- We're predators, not puppies.
- Stefan found a way around it before.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.161
Stefan built himself
a delusional wagon...

04:06.371 --> 04:10.165
...which he's repeatedly fallen off of.
What he needs to learn is control.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.126
He was able to manage
when he was drinking my blood...

04:13.336 --> 04:15.128
...small amounts every single day.

turn you into a toad or a block of salt.

for the darkness to take hold.

Because I can help you be a vampire.
I can teach you self-control...
