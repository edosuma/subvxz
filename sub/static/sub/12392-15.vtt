09:11.010 --> 09:13.217
LOOK...LET'S JUST
GET IT DONE.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.740
WE'LL FIND THE GIRL

09:14.780 --> 09:17.613

09:17.650 --> 09:18.719

09:28.700 --> 09:29.769
'SCUSE ME.

09:30.830 --> 09:31.819
WE'RE OLD FRIENDS OF HIS.

09:31.870 --> 09:33.235
I THINK HE'S INSIDE

09:33.270 --> 09:34.669
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.997
TURNS OUT IT WAS
A FLESH-EATING VIRUS.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.166
AAH!

09:37.210 --> 09:38.734
OH, I GET IT.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.874
YOU'RE THE FUNNY GUY.

09:40.910 --> 09:42.002
YOU GUYS
MUST BE COUNSELORS.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.200
I'M CLIVE.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.205
IN CHARGE OF ALL
WATER ACTIVITIES

09:45.250 --> 09:47.047
BILLY, FITN ESS/ N UTRITION.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.638
BODY SCULPTING.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.988
I'M A BIT
OF A FITNESS BUFF MYSELF.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.749
I'M TRAINING
FOR THE SANTA BARBARA 1K.

09:51.790 --> 09:54.179
THAT'S ONLY ABOUT
3,000 FEET.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.619
THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF TRAINING INVOLVED.

09:55.660 --> 09:58.629
[sexy music]

09:58.660 --> 10:07.034
*

10:07.070 --> 10:08.367
HELLO!

10:10.770 --> 10:12.135
OH, PLEASE
DON'T DO THIS.
DO WHAT?

10:12.170 --> 10:13.933
EVERY TIME YOU SEE
A MARGINALLY CUTE GIRL,

10:13.980 --> 10:15.277
YOU LOSE
ALL SEMBLANCE OF REASON.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.334
I DON'T DO THAT!

10:16.380 --> 10:17.938
JUST LIKE YOU DON'T
FLICK YOUR NOSE WITH YOUR THUMB

10:17.980 --> 10:18.969
WHEN YOU'RE
TRYING TO ACT COOL.

10:19.010 --> 10:19.977
JASON, WE MADE IT.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.044
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO HIM?

10:21.080 --> 10:22.047
HE'S FINE.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.308
THOSE ARE NURSE'S SHOES.

10:23.350 --> 10:24.715
THEY'RE PROBABLY
VERY COMFORTABLE.

10:24.750 --> 10:25.739
THEY'RE BOTH LEFI' FEET.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.212
HELLO, BURTON.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.409
SHANE.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.779
I'M SO GLAD
YOU COULD DROP BY.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.819
I HAD SOME

10:30.860 --> 10:31.622
BISCUITS IN THE OVEN.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.423
BUT I FORGOT
TO LIGHT THE PILOT.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.791
JASON, ARE YOU
FEELING OKAY?

10:34.830 --> 10:36.422
I'M SUPER.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.223
DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT THE BISCUITS?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.899
UH, MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.
I'M A PSYCHIC.

10:41.940 --> 10:42.964
THIS IS MY PARTNER
LUMPKIN--

10:43.010 --> 10:44.807
MY NAME IS GUS.

10:44.840 --> 10:45.761
BUT YOU CAN
CALL ME SLICKS.

10:45.810 --> 10:46.777
SLICKS?

10:46.810 --> 10:47.777
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

10:47.810 --> 10:49.698
SISSY, ARTS AND CRAFI'S.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.308
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD, THANK YOU.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.272
ANYWAY, WE ARE HERE
TO HELP TRACK DOWN

10:53.320 --> 10:54.844
YOUR MISSING COUNSELOR.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.745
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
ANNIE CALLED.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.848
I THOUGHT SHE--
I THOUGHT SHE--

10:57.890 --> 10:59.016
I THOUGHT
SHE WOULD CALL.

10:59.050 --> 11:00.779
SHE HASN'T--
SHE HASN'T CALLED.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.185
BUT WE'RE SURE
SHE'S FINE.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.426
JASON....WHAT
HAVEN'T YOU TOLD 'EM?

11:03.460 --> 11:04.825
YOU GUYS ARE AWARE
THAT THIS IS A--

11:04.860 --> 11:05.929
BILLY...

11:05.960 --> 11:08.099
LET'S KEEP OUR BUSINESS
OUR BUSINESS.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.893
OKAY?

11:09.930 --> 11:11.795
THIS IS JUST
ABOUT ANNIE.

11:11.830 --> 11:14.765
NOW...SHOW THEM
THE CAMP HOUSE.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.471
WHAT'S WITH THE DOLL?

11:25.510 --> 11:27.375
IT'S FOR THE KIDS, SHAWN.
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.240
YOU'RE TRYING TO INTERPRET
EVERYTHING AS CREEPY

11:29.280 --> 11:30.918
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
JEALOUS OF JASON.

11:30.950 --> 11:32.042
LET'S JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.257
THIS PLACE IS MUSTY.

11:35.290 --> 11:36.985
IT'S VINTAGE, SHAWN.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.088
[sighs]

11:53.240 --> 11:55.231
HELLO, SISSY.
HI, SLICKS.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.168
THIS IS THE LAST PLACE
WE KNOW ANNIE WAS FOR SURE.

11:57.210 --> 11:59.349
I TALKED TO HER
ON THE PHONE LAST NIGHT.

12:02.550 --> 12:03.778
WELL, THEN...

12:03.820 --> 12:04.980
[sniffs]

12:05.020 --> 12:07.409
MY GUESS IS THAT SHE DIDN'T
GET UP AT THE CRACK OF DAWN

12:07.460 --> 12:08.916
AND GO FOR A HIKE.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.258
SO YOU GUYS REALLY CAME HERE
WHEN YOU WERE KIDS, HUH?

12:11.290 --> 12:12.996
(Gus)
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

12:13.030 --> 12:14.156
DO THE BUNK BED THING.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.349
MAKE SOME LANYARDS.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.492
CATCH A FISH.

12:16.530 --> 12:18.327
GO HOME EARLY
BECAUSE SOME REPAIRMAN

12:18.370 --> 12:19.928
GOT ELECT ROCUTED
IN THE SWIMMING POOL

12:19.970 --> 12:21.335
AND THE CAMP CLOSED.

12:21.370 --> 12:23.065
OH, MY GOD,
THAT REALLY HAPPENED?

12:23.110 --> 12:24.930
YES.
IT WAS A TRAGIC
ACCIDENT.

12:24.970 --> 12:26.801
AND IT HAPPENED
20 YEARS AGO.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.817
WHAT IS THAT?

12:37.850 --> 12:38.987
LAUNDRY SHACK.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.380
(Shawn)
WHO'S DOING LAUNDRY?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.489
NOT ME--WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO USE THE DRYER.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.191
IT DRAINS TOO MUCH ENERGY,

12:48.230 --> 12:50.824
AND OUR GENERATOR'S
MESSED UP.

12:58.470 --> 13:00.472
[dryer rumbling]

13:44.190 --> 13:46.010
AAH!

13:47.060 --> 13:55.126
[sobbing]

13:55.160 --> 13:56.593
THOSE ARE ANNIE'S PAJAMAS.

13:56.630 --> 13:57.597
IT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING.

13:57.630 --> 13:58.597
SHE COULD BE FINE.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.460
BILLY'S RIGHT--

13:59.500 --> 14:01.434
MAYBE SHE WAS PAINTING
A FIRE ENGINE

14:01.470 --> 14:02.459
AND DECIDED
TO GO FOR A SWIM.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.263
THIS IS NOT PAINT,
SHAWN.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.107
WHO COULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

14:06.140 --> 14:07.107
ANYBODY FOR

14:07.140 --> 14:08.505
THE TOOTHLESS OLD GUY
ON THE RUSTY SCHWINN?

14:08.540 --> 14:10.269
YOU MEAN THE JANITOR?

14:10.310 --> 14:11.299
JANITOR?

14:11.350 --> 14:12.942
UH, TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

14:12.980 --> 14:14.413
I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GETTING YOUR MONEY'S WORTH.

14:14.450 --> 14:16.509
(Jason)
CRAZY OLD ERWEN.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.040
ERWEN WOULDN'T
HURT A FLY.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.957
WOULD ANYBODY LIKE
SOME TEA?

14:20.990 --> 14:22.150
MAYBE SOMETHING BLACK?

14:24.430 --> 14:25.624
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DECIDE NOW.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.389
I'LL JUST PUT SOME ON.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.097
OKAY, WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

14:33.140 --> 14:34.596
TEA ISN'T THE WORST IDEA EVER.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.232
IT'S A GREAT
STRESS REDUCER.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.608
THIS CYCLE JUST STARTED.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.302
WHICH MEANS
WHOEVER DID THIS IS CLOSE.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.978
I SAY WE GO
LOOKING FOR HER.

14:44.010 --> 14:45.238
CLIVE?

14:45.280 --> 14:47.111
DEFINE LOOKING FOR HER.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.515
[whispering]
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY
FEEL LIKE

14:48.550 --> 14:50.484
LOSING ANY
OF MY EXTREMITIES.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.379
WE STAY WITHIN
SHOUTING DISTANCE.

14:54.420 --> 14:56.479
WE MEET BACK
AT THE OFFICE AT 6:00.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.227
NOBODY'S ONE MINUTE LATE.
YOU GOT ME?

14:59.260 --> 15:01.148
LET'S TWIST THIS.

15:05.230 --> 15:06.629
OKAY...YOU GUYS
AREN'T GONNA

15:06.670 --> 15:08.035
LET ME GO ALONE,
ARE YOU?

15:08.070 --> 15:10.334
OF COURSE NOT.
YES, WE ARE.

15:10.370 --> 15:12.702
WE WERE ACTUALLY THINKING
OF STAYING HERE

15:12.740 --> 15:13.809
IN THE LAUNDRY SHACK.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.479
REALLY SCOPING THIS PLACE OUT
WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB.

15:16.510 --> 15:18.501
OH, PLEASE, GUS.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.370
ANNIE COULD BE
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.717
I HEAR YOU.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.012
SHE'S RIGHT, SHAWN.

15:23.050 --> 15:24.085
ANNIE NEEDS US.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.008
EXCUSE HIM.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.316
WE'VE NEVER MET ANNIE.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.611
SHE COULD BE
A TERRIBLE PERSON.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.082
WE'VE SUDDENLY FALLEN

15:31.130 --> 15:33.098
INTO SOME KIND
OF SLASHER MOVIE SCENARIO

15:33.130 --> 15:34.552
AND WE'RE MAKING
ALL THE CLASSIC MISTAKES.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.591
WE STAY HERE,
SHUT THE DOOR,

15:36.630 --> 15:38.518
WAIT FOR HELP.

15:39.670 --> 15:40.967
UHH!

15:42.440 --> 15:44.635
AT LEAST TAKE
SOMETHING POINTY!

15:50.350 --> 15:52.671
ANNIE!
ANNIE!

15:52.710 --> 15:54.246
IT'LL BE OKAY, SISSY.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.111
I'M SURE THERE'S
A PERFECT LY LOGICAL EXPLANATION

15:56.150 --> 15:57.117
FOR ALL OF THIS.

15:57.150 --> 15:58.117
OH, NO, THERE ISN'T.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.414
BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTEMPT
TO PUT ME AT EASE.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.348
I AM LITERALLY SHAKING
OVER HERE.

16:02.390 --> 16:03.425
DON'T WORRY.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.451
THEY CALL ME
FEARLESS GUSTER.

16:05.490 --> 16:06.457
1--

16:06.490 --> 16:07.457
AAH!

16:07.500 --> 16:09.695
[clang]

16:09.730 --> 16:12.164
AND THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM!

16:12.200 --> 16:14.031
ANNIE?

16:14.070 --> 16:15.389
ANNIE!

16:22.640 --> 16:24.449
SOMEBODY THERE?

16:24.480 --> 16:26.539
HUH?

16:26.580 --> 16:28.548
'CAUSE I'M RIGHT HERE.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.184
AAH!

16:41.700 --> 16:43.122
HELLO.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.660
MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?

16:44.700 --> 16:45.792
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.537
I HAVE A RESERVATION UNDER
CARLTON LASSITER AND SPOUSE.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.458
YOUR RESERVATION
IS FOR 7:00 PM.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.534
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:52.570 --> 16:54.435
IT'S 5:20.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.129
YEAH, WELL...

16:56.180 --> 16:57.442
PARKING WASN'T QUITE
THE RA'I'I'LESNAKE

16:57.480 --> 16:58.572
I HAD ANTICIPATED.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.373
WELL, SIR,
NONE OF OUR WAIT STAFF

17:00.420 --> 17:01.318
HAS ARRIVED AS OF YET,

17:01.350 --> 17:03.181
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU
THE TABLE WILL BE READY

17:03.220 --> 17:04.209
AT 7:00 SHARP.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.478
I'LL WAIT.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.179
YOU'RE...GOING TO STAND HERE?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.323
I'M A PEACE OFFICER.
I'M PRACT ICED IN SURVEILLANCE.

17:12.360 --> 17:15.227
I CAN REMAIN MOTIONLESS FOR
UP TO EIGHT HOURS, IF NEED BE.

17:15.260 --> 17:18.388
THE BAR IS ALSO OPEN
IF YOU'D PREFER TO SIT.

17:18.430 --> 17:19.567
OH, THAT'S GOOD TOO.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.675
VICTORIA.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.541
ME TOO.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.546
[chuckles]

17:44.660 --> 17:46.480
[creaking]

17:49.430 --> 17:51.569
HELLO?

17:51.600 --> 17:52.669
SHAWN?

17:52.700 --> 17:53.769
[bang]

17:55.640 --> 17:57.369
(Shawn)
JULES!

17:57.410 --> 17:58.399
WOW.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.431
YOU MADE
REALLY GOOD TIME.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.539
SHAWN, ARE YOU HIDING
IN THAT CLOSET?

18:02.580 --> 18:04.673
NO.

18:04.710 --> 18:05.699
NO, I'M NOT.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.615
THAT'S A NEGATIVE.

18:07.650 --> 18:10.539
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

18:10.590 --> 18:13.559
OKAY, THIS IS WEIRD.

18:13.590 --> 18:15.114
HERE'S THE THING,
JULES,

18:15.160 --> 18:17.321
AND I WOULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE EXPECTED YOU TO KNOW THIS.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.158
BUT SOMETIMES
THE PSYCHIC HEADLIGHTS

18:20.200 --> 18:21.451
CAN GET A LITTLE BRIGHT.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.128
AND I HAVE TO BALANCE
THAT EFFERVESCENCE

18:24.170 --> 18:25.694
WITH DARK SPACE.

18:25.730 --> 18:26.697
CLOSETS ARE VERY GOOD.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.698
COFFINS ARE GREAT.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.662
SHAWN, YOU SOUNDED
REALLY SPOOKED ON THE PHONE.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.665
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:31.710 --> 18:32.506
YEAH, UH, SOLID QUESTION,

18:32.540 --> 18:34.132
AND I'M GONNA BRING YOU
UP TO SPEED.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.375
BUT...FIRST, WOULD YOU
MIND COMING BACK IN

18:36.410 --> 18:38.241
AND CATCHING ME DOING
SOME INVERTED SIT-UPS

18:38.280 --> 18:42.114
OR PERHAPS LIFTING
A LARGE ANVIL OVER MY HEAD?

18:44.750 --> 18:46.388
WHERE'S BILLY?

18:46.420 --> 18:48.479
I DON'T KNOW.
WE SPLIT UP.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.556
WELL, DID YOU
FIND ANYTHING?

18:50.590 --> 18:52.421
I STUMBLED UPON ERWEN'S
LIVING QUARTERS,

18:52.460 --> 18:53.722
AND I MEAN THAT LOOSELY.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.557
GUS!
THERE YOU ARE.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.420
LOOK WHO I FOUND.
(Gus)
WHAT THE...

18:57.470 --> 18:59.665
I'M CLIVE. I'M HILARIOUS,
AND I HAVE NO GIRLFRIEND.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.634
HI, I'M JULIETTE,
AND I'M A COP.

19:01.670 --> 19:03.331
NICE REJECT ION.
VERY CLEAN.

19:03.370 --> 19:04.359
HAVE YOU SEEN BILLY?

19:04.410 --> 19:05.536
NO.

19:05.570 --> 19:06.730
HE SAID 6:00 SHARP,
NOT A MINUTE LATE.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.601
AND THEN HE SAID,
"LET'S TWIST THIS."

19:08.640 --> 19:10.403
IT'S TEN PAST.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.406
LISTEN, IF HALF OF WHAT
SHAWN HAS TOLD ME IS TRUE,

19:12.450 --> 19:13.610
NONE OF YOU ARE

19:13.650 --> 19:14.947
BEING VERY SMART.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.572
EVERYONE NEEDS TO GET INSIDE,
TOGETHER, NOW.

19:16.620 --> 19:17.609
LET'S GO.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.584
COME ON.

19:19.620 --> 19:22.418
SO YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW
THIS JASON GUY AT ALL?

19:22.460 --> 19:23.779
ANY OF YOU?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.855
(Sissy)
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET HIM
TALK ME INTO THIS.

19:25.890 --> 19:27.198
CAREFUL, SISSY.

19:27.230 --> 19:28.197
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD--

19:28.230 --> 19:29.720
FORGET THAT.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

19:29.760 --> 19:33.764
JASON WASN'T COMPLETELY HONEST
WITH YOU GUYS, HE...

19:39.310 --> 19:41.608
CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU WERE
ABOUT TO SAY, SISSY.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.608
CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

19:46.750 --> 19:47.819
WHO IS SHE?

19:47.850 --> 19:48.874
DETECTIVE O'HARA.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.387
ONE OF SANTA BARBARA'S
FINEST,

19:50.420 --> 19:52.513
BOTH LITERALLY
AND FIGURATIVELY.

19:52.550 --> 19:53.881
JUDAS.

19:53.920 --> 19:54.887
PARDON ME?

19:54.920 --> 19:57.354
NO COPS!

19:57.390 --> 19:58.789
YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD,
SPENCER.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.991
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!

20:01.030 --> 20:03.498
LOOK, JASON,
WE HAVE BLOOD-SOAKED PAJAMAS

20:03.530 --> 20:04.963
IN THE DRYER,
AND NOW BILLY'S MISSING TOO.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.262
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY

20:06.300 --> 20:07.665
THAT THERE IS A CLEAR
AND PRESENT...

20:07.700 --> 20:09.668
DANGER HERE.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.634
I'M FINISHED.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.376
I CAN'T OPEN THE CAMP NOW.

20:13.410 --> 20:14.434
NOT NOW!

20:14.480 --> 20:16.232
LISTEN, JASON,
I AM NOT THE ENEMY HERE.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.305
I THINK WE ALL JUST
NEED TO STAY TOGETHER.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.568
NOBODY HAD TO KNOW.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.269
I COULD HAVE FIXED THIS.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.787
YOU DESTROYED ME!

20:23.820 --> 20:24.787
IAGO!

20:27.860 --> 20:29.009
WHAT DOES THE PARROT
FROM ALADDIN

20:29.060 --> 20:30.288
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

20:30.330 --> 20:31.683
HE'S NOT WELL.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.789
WE CAN'T JUST LET HIM
GO OUT THERE ALL BY HIMSELF.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.923
NO, YOU STAY HERE
WITH US.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.723
SHE'S RIGHT, YOU STAY HERE
WITH SISSY AND CLIVE.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.658
GUS AND I
WILL BRING JASON BACK.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.839
THIS IS OUR CASE.
HE'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

20:41.870 --> 20:43.406
YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR MIND

20:43.440 --> 20:44.839
IF YOU THINK FOR ONE SECOND
I'M GOING OUT THERE.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.565
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH
SLASHER MOVIES TO KNOW

20:46.610 --> 20:47.736
THAT WHEN THE BROTHER
GOES OFF TO THE WOODS,

20:47.780 --> 20:49.304
HE DOESN'T EVEN
SORTA COME BACK.

20:49.340 --> 20:50.739
[chuckles]

20:50.780 --> 20:51.940
[whispering]
SORRY.

20:51.980 --> 20:54.346
LL COOL J MADE IT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH DEEP BLUE SEA.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.439
THAT WAS IN THE WATER,
SHAWN, WITH SHARKS.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.742
AND SAM JACKSON'S ASS

20:57.790 --> 20:59.610
STILL GOT SWALLOWED WHOLE.

21:01.820 --> 21:05.426
FINE.
I'LL GO ALONE.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.427
I DON'T LIKE THIS, SHAWN.

21:06.460 --> 21:07.552
WELL, YOUR HANDS

21:07.600 --> 21:08.692
ARE A LITTLE BIT TIED,
AREN'T THEY?

21:08.730 --> 21:10.766
PLUS, WHEN YOU SHOWED UP,
I WAS HIDING IN A CLOSET.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.892
SO I FIGURE I'M DUE
TO MAN UP.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.762
IF I'M NOT BACK
IN EXACTLY FOUR MINUTES,

21:14.800 --> 21:15.835
PLEASE GO LOOKING FOR ME.

21:15.870 --> 21:17.701
BUT REALLY START GIVING IT

21:17.740 --> 21:19.332
SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT
AFTER TWO.

21:19.370 --> 21:21.076
AND IF YOU THINK
THAT THERE'S ANYTHING

21:21.110 --> 21:22.577
EVEN SLIGHTLY AMISS

21:22.610 --> 21:23.838
AFTER 45 SECONDS,

21:23.880 --> 21:24.778
YOU'RE THE LEADER HERE.

21:27.980 --> 21:31.609
I TOLD YOU WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE
COME BACK TO THIS PLACE.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.610
[door opens and closes]

21:34.660 --> 21:35.752
[wind whipping]

21:35.790 --> 21:37.826
JASON!

21:39.660 --> 21:41.059
DUDE, WE TOOK A VOTE!

21:41.100 --> 21:42.556
STAYING IN THE HOUSE

21:42.600 --> 21:44.591
AND NOT WANDERING
AROUND THE WOODS WON!

21:46.370 --> 21:47.962
IT'S PRETTY MUCH
UNANIMOUS.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.505
AW, MAN, WE CAN TOTALLY
DO LAUNDRY IN THE MORNING!

22:02.080 --> 22:03.616
ANNIE?

22:05.550 --> 22:07.017
ARE YOU OKAY?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.387
ARE YOU OKAY?

22:12.860 --> 22:15.499
ARE YOU OKAY...ANNIE?

22:19.100 --> 22:21.694
[screams like a girl]

22:22.970 --> 22:25.734
[high-pitched scream]

22:43.960 --> 22:45.382
UHH!

22:47.800 --> 22:50.462
DROP IT, OR I WILL
SHOOT YOU WHERE YOU STAND!

22:50.500 --> 22:52.468
NO! DON'T SHOOT!

22:52.500 --> 22:53.535
I HAVE THE SHOT!

22:53.570 --> 22:55.060
DON'T SHOOT!

22:55.100 --> 22:55.896
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

22:55.940 --> 22:58.636
THIS ISN'T FRIDAY THE 13TH !

22:58.670 --> 23:00.774
IT'S APRIL FOOL'S DAY !

23:00.810 --> 23:02.539
SAME FORMULA!

23:02.580 --> 23:04.639
BUT WITH A KILLER
TWIST ENDING.

23:09.780 --> 23:11.088
[laughing]

23:11.120 --> 23:12.644
YOU...

23:12.690 --> 23:13.714
ALMOST HAD ME.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.115
YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT,
MY LORD.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.889
[laughing]

23:17.930 --> 23:19.488
BRAVO...

23:19.530 --> 23:21.555
WOW.
MR. CUNNINGHAM.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.555
BRAVO!

23:22.600 --> 23:23.897
YOU DID IT, SHAWN.

23:23.930 --> 23:25.898
YOU REALLY ARE
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

23:25.930 --> 23:27.534
WHAT THE--

23:27.570 --> 23:29.891
DETECTIVE,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

23:29.940 --> 23:32.829
YOU...YOU SO WERE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.577
SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.077
IN A NUTSHELL...

23:37.110 --> 23:38.077
[laughs]

23:38.110 --> 23:40.670
JASON'S REOPENING
CAMP TIKIHAMA, ALL RIGHT.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.971
BUT IT'S NOT
FOR THE KIDDIES.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.146
I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

23:43.180 --> 23:45.216
HE DIDN'T EVEN REFILL
THE SWIMMING POOL.

23:45.250 --> 23:48.549
NO, HE'S GOT SOMETHING
MUCH DARKER IN MIND.

23:48.590 --> 23:49.887
A MURDER CAMP.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.558
[laughing]

23:51.590 --> 23:52.625
IT'S LIKE THOSE
MYSTERY TRAIN THINGS.

23:52.660 --> 23:54.958
BUT WAY, WAY COOLER.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.560
EVERY OTHER WEEK,
EIGHT PEOPLE PAY TO HAVE

23:57.600 --> 23:59.488
THE BEJESUS
SCARED OUT OF THEM

23:59.530 --> 24:02.590
AND SOLVE A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
WHODUNIT MURDER MYSTERY.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.528
I NEEDED A REHEARSAL, HEH.

24:04.570 --> 24:06.663
AND YOU TWO
WERE IN ON THIS?

24:06.710 --> 24:07.734
ONLY THE SETUP.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.509
THE DRY RUN JASON STARTED
CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.007
SCARED ME SENSELESS.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.779
BUT, WHOA!
WHAT A RUSH.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.471
WE ALL KNEW
ABOUT THE CAM P,

24:14.520 --> 24:16.044
BUT WE HAD NO IDEA
THAT WE WERE GONNA BE

24:16.080 --> 24:17.684
HIS LITTLE GUINEA PIGS
THIS WEEK.

24:17.720 --> 24:18.914
IT WAS SO WEIRD!

24:18.950 --> 24:20.986
I COULD SENSE THAT THERE HAD
BEEN A STRUGGLE IN THE KITCHEN.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.009
IT'S ME, IT'S ME.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.618
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

24:23.660 --> 24:25.184
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.788
QUITE A MESS,
BUT SOMEBODY...

24:26.830 --> 24:28.058
SOMEBODY COVERED IT UP.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.522
THAT'S AMAZING.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.663
HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WASN'T REAL?

24:30.700 --> 24:31.928
WELL, I'M A PSYCHIC, JASON.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.665
THERE'S NO RELIABLE DEFENSE
FOR THAT.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.895
I COULD FEEL THAT NOTHING
WAS WHAT IT SEEMED.

24:35.940 --> 24:37.737
BUT I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT GUS.

24:37.770 --> 24:39.533
YOU WERE RIGHT, PARTNER.

24:39.570 --> 24:41.003
THAT WASN'T PAINT
ON ANNIE'S CLOTHES.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.507
PAINT DRIES.
SO DOES BLOOD.

24:42.540 --> 24:45.270
BUT CORN SYRUP MIXED
WITH RED DYE NUMBER THREE,

24:45.310 --> 24:46.277
NOT SO MUCH.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.016
THAT'S HOW WE DO IT.

24:48.050 --> 24:49.278
YIN AND YANG.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.878
I'M THE SPARK
THAT STARTS THE FIRE.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.512
OF COURSE, THAT PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE OCCURRED TO ME

24:52.550 --> 24:54.256
IF YOU HADN'T WIPED IT
ALL OVER YOUR PANTS.

24:54.290 --> 24:55.518
BUDDY.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.528
YOU SEE, MY BEST FRIEND

24:57.560 --> 24:58.959
CAN'T STAND
THE SIGHT OF BLOOD.

24:58.990 --> 25:00.548
HE'S EVEN FAINTED
ON OCCASION.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.794
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.889
WHA--I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

25:03.930 --> 25:05.067
YOU WERE IN ON ALL THIS?!

25:05.100 --> 25:06.522
WELL, JASON CALLED ME
A WEEK AGO,

25:06.570 --> 25:07.889
AND I FIGURED THIS WAS
THE PERFECT CHANCE

25:07.940 --> 25:09.896
TO GET SHAWN BACK
FOR AN ENTIRE LIFETIME

25:09.940 --> 25:11.567
OF SCARING THE DAYLIGHTS
OUT OF ME.

25:11.610 --> 25:12.759
KILLER "B"!
WHAT?

25:12.810 --> 25:14.277
[both make shot noise
and blow]

25:14.310 --> 25:15.572
[laughs]

25:15.610 --> 25:18.249
SO HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.817
YOU TWO ARE MY LEAST FAVORITE
TAG TEAM OF ALL TIME.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.545
REALLY, WITH IRON SHEIK

25:22.580 --> 25:24.013
AND NIKOLAI VOLKOFF
ON THE TABLE?

25:24.050 --> 25:25.540
WOW...

25:25.590 --> 25:27.319
YOU JUST MADE
THAT REFERENCE.

25:27.350 --> 25:30.012
(Jason)
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
LET ME START

25:30.060 --> 25:31.687
THE APOLOGY TRAIN.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.698
THERE IS CHAMPAGNE
ON ICE INSIDE.

25:33.730 --> 25:34.549
MAYBE STRAWBERRIES!

25:34.600 --> 25:37.694
[thunder]

25:38.770 --> 25:39.998
WE SHOULD GO INSIDE.

25:40.030 --> 25:42.999
[upbeat music]

25:43.040 --> 25:47.101
*

25:47.140 --> 25:50.746
[all cheer]

26:04.760 --> 26:08.059
ONE, TWO, THREE.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.089
VERY NICE.

26:09.130 --> 26:10.666
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.136
COME ON, JULES.
TRY TO HAVE SOME FUN.

26:16.170 --> 26:17.706
WE'RE NOT
BEING CHASED AROUND

26:17.740 --> 26:18.900
BY AN AXE-WIELDING MANIAC
ANYMORE.

26:18.940 --> 26:20.168
IT'S KIND OF A SICK
LITTLE CHARADE

26:20.210 --> 26:22.701
AND BEEN A COLOSSAL WASTE
OF MY TIME.

26:22.740 --> 26:25.243
BUT...SINCE IT'S NOT A CRIME
TO BE DISTASTEFUL,

26:25.280 --> 26:27.077
MAYBE I CAN HANG OUT
TILL THE STORM PASSES.

26:27.110 --> 26:28.941
I THINK I SAW
SOME CHOCODILES IN THE FRIDGE.

26:28.980 --> 26:30.140
TEMPTING.

26:30.180 --> 26:32.080
I SHALL RETURN.
HMM.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.327
[needle scratching on record]

26:39.360 --> 26:42.329
[ominous music]

26:42.360 --> 26:45.090
*

26:46.770 --> 26:48.362
[all grunt]

26:54.910 --> 26:56.002
CRAZY OLD MAN.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.302
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO YOURSELF?

26:57.340 --> 26:58.898
[radio announcer]
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT

26:58.950 --> 27:00.406
UP TO THE MOUNTAINS
THIS WEEKEND,

27:00.450 --> 27:01.314
GOOD LUCK.

27:01.350 --> 27:03.238
HIGHWAY 17 HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY BLOCKED

27:03.280 --> 27:05.214
BY AN OVERTURNED LOGGING TRUCK.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.218
UGH. PERFECT.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.979
THE WIND
PROBABLY BROUGHT DOWN

27:09.020 --> 27:11.284
THE ONLY TOWER
WE HAD IN THE AREA.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.786
I'LL RADIO
FOR AN AMBULANCE.

27:12.830 --> 27:13.797
DON'T BOTH ER.

27:13.830 --> 27:15.752
THEY WON'T BE COMING,
AND WE WON'T BE GOING.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.927
NOT TONIGHT.
THE ROAD IS COMPLETELY BLOCKED.

27:17.970 --> 27:26.935
OF COURSE IT IS.

27:26.970 --> 27:28.938
A, UH, CONFIDANTE TOLD ME
NOT TOO BRAZEN--

27:28.980 --> 27:31.801
THAT I SHOULD PROCEED
WITH CAUTION.

27:31.850 --> 27:32.908
AND THEN I REALIZED

27:32.950 --> 27:35.976
THAT'S EXACTLY MY PROBLEM.

27:36.020 --> 27:38.238
I NEVER TOOK ANY CHANCES.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.985
I DIDN'T SEIZE THE MOMENT.

27:40.020 --> 27:42.352
I NEVER...LET MY EMOTIONS
CARRY ME.

27:42.390 --> 27:44.324
I ANALYZED IT ALL
TO DEATH.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.282
PR-PROTECTING MYSELF.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.025
OR PROTECTING SOMETHING.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS.

27:48.060 --> 27:50.028
BUT THAT'S
WHY WE'RE HERE.

27:50.060 --> 27:51.891
MM-HMM.
IN THIS PLACE.

27:51.930 --> 27:54.990
'CAUSE. . .I WAN NA RESTART.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.338
I WANT A SECOND CHANCE
AT A FIRST IMPRESSION.

27:57.370 --> 28:00.999
SO...HERE IS SOMETHING

28:01.040 --> 28:05.170
FROM THE GUY
WITH NOTHING TO PROTECT.

28:05.210 --> 28:08.816
HEART ON SLEEVE,
HAT IN HAND.

28:08.850 --> 28:10.715
[whispers]
OH, GOD.

28:10.750 --> 28:11.978
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.988
JUST...JUST PUT IT ON.

28:14.020 --> 28:16.113
IT IS LONG OVERDUE.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.128
NO, THIS IS...

28:18.160 --> 28:19.388
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

28:19.430 --> 28:22.024
WELL, I'VE BEEN WORKING
SOME OVERTIME LATELY,

28:22.060 --> 28:23.994
AND SOLD SOME CONFISCATED KNIVES
ON CRAIGSLIST.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.122
AND OF COURSE
THAT STIMULUS CHECK,

28:25.170 --> 28:26.899
THAT CERTAINLY HELPED.

28:26.930 --> 28:28.932
THERE'S BEEN A--
A BIG MISTAKE.

28:28.970 --> 28:31.029
WHAT?

28:31.070 --> 28:32.435
IS IT...

28:32.470 --> 28:33.505
DID I DO SOMETHING?

28:33.540 --> 28:34.507
NO, IT'S ME.

28:34.540 --> 28:37.373
ITHINK, UM...

28:37.410 --> 28:40.379
I THINK THAT I
WAS NOT VERY CLEAR

28:40.410 --> 28:42.219
ABOUT MY INTENTIONS

28:42.250 --> 28:44.218
WHEN I SAID THAT
I NEEDED TO MEET WITH YOU.

28:49.990 --> 28:52.754
WHAT IS THIS?

28:52.790 --> 28:55.054
IT'S OUR DIVORCE PAPERS.

29:01.070 --> 29:03.061
NOBODY IS TO TOUCH
THAT BODY.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.034
I CAN JUSTIFY MOVING IT
BECAUSE OF THE STORM,

29:05.070 --> 29:06.059
BUT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE,

29:06.110 --> 29:07.907
THAT PORCH IS OFF LIMITS.

29:07.940 --> 29:08.804
DO WE KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

29:08.840 --> 29:10.944
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
BEFORE AN AUTOPSY,

29:10.980 --> 29:13.198
BUT THERE ARE NO CLEAR SIGNS
OF FOUL PLAY THAT I CAN SEE.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.969
WELL, HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T
STRIKE ME AS MUCH OF A SWIMMER.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.317
HIS TRAILER DOESN'T HAVE
ANY RUNNING WATER.

29:17.350 --> 29:18.419
HE BATHES IN THE LAKE.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.111
UGH, STILL NOTHING.

29:20.150 --> 29:22.914
I WANT TO KNOW THE SECOND
ANY OF YOU CAN USE YOUR PHONES.

29:22.960 --> 29:23.949
[slams phone down]

29:23.990 --> 29:25.981
I GUESS THIS KILLS THE GAME
OF STRIP CRIBBAGE

29:26.030 --> 29:27.088
THAT I WAS TRYING
TO START.

29:27.130 --> 29:27.926
NO, LET'S DO IT.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.894
ANYTHING TO GET MY MIND
OFF THIS DAY.

29:29.930 --> 29:30.919
COME ON, GUS.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.198
JASON,
YOU'RE PLAYING TOO.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.561
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
MY DEAR.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.898
COME ON, CLIVE, YOU KNOW
YOU WANT SOME OF THIS ACTION.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.931
NO, THANKS.
I GOT WEIRD NIPPLES.

29:37.970 --> 29:39.403
THOUGH IT DOES SEEM APPROPRIATE
TO PLAY A GAME

29:39.440 --> 29:40.930
WITH A DEAD GUY
ON THE PORCH.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.039
I GOT A DATE IN THE DEN
WITH THE MOON PATROL.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.900
WHAT ABOUT YOU, ANNIE?
YOU IN?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.269
UM...NO.

29:46.310 --> 29:48.073
I WANT THE REST
OF THIS MUCK OFF MY NECK.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.269
I WANT A HOT SHOWER.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.912
UH, ANNIE,

29:50.950 --> 29:51.939
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

29:51.990 --> 29:53.548
AWAY FROM THE ANIMALS.

29:53.590 --> 29:55.581
DON'T WORRY, YOU DON'T NEED
TO BABYSIT ME, OKAY?

29:55.620 --> 29:58.020
[sniffles]
I'LL JUST BE IN MY CABIN,

29:58.060 --> 30:01.291
REGRETTING THE DECISION TO TAKE
THIS JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.460
JULES, MAY I HAVE
A WORD, PLEASE?

30:09.140 --> 30:11.005
SOMETHING STILL
FEELS OFF.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.439
I'M GETTING SOME
PRETTY STRONG VIBES

30:12.470 --> 30:14.108
THAT ERWEN DIDN'T HAVE
THE BIG ONE

30:14.140 --> 30:15.607
WHILE HE WAS EXFOLIATING
HIS ARMPITS.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.073
CAN'T YOU DO
BETTER THAN VIBES?

30:17.110 --> 30:20.079
JEFF GOLDBLUM
AND CYNDI LAUPER COULDN'T.

30:20.110 --> 30:20.917
HOW 'BOUT YOU LET ME

30:20.950 --> 30:23.441
HAVE AN HONEST LOOK
AT THAT BODY?

30:23.480 --> 30:24.549
ALL RIGHT.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.581
[wind whistling]

30:43.070 --> 30:43.968
HE'S A LITTLE NICKED UP,

30:44.010 --> 30:45.466
BUT THE CURRENT
CARRIED HIM PRETTY FAR,

30:45.510 --> 30:47.899
SO IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.032
NO TOUCHING, SHAWN.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.378
DIDN'T NEED TO BE SAID.

30:56.220 --> 30:57.414
ANYTHING?

30:59.990 --> 31:01.309
IT'S NOT CLEAR.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.554
NOT YET.

31:35.190 --> 31:37.249
STRIP CRIBBAGE, MY ASS.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.525
[sighs]

31:43.560 --> 31:44.527
[gasp5]

31:44.570 --> 31:45.969
JASON!

31:46.000 --> 31:47.092
YOU JERK!

31:47.130 --> 31:48.961
THAT IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.194
GET OUT OF HERE.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.631
JASON?

31:56.110 --> 31:57.077
AAH!

31:57.110 --> 31:58.338
[laughing]

31:58.380 --> 32:00.245
WHAT IS THAT NOW,
FOUR IN A ROW?

32:00.280 --> 32:01.178
[laughs]

32:01.220 --> 32:03.575
THIS IS NUTS.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.282
YOU STILL HAVE ON
YOUR SHOES AND SOCKS?

32:06.320 --> 32:09.050
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW THIS GAME WORKS?

32:09.090 --> 32:10.057
OH!

32:10.090 --> 32:11.159
WOW!

32:11.190 --> 32:12.122
BOY...BILLY.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.219
I WILL GIVE YOU
EVERYTHING IN GUS'S WALLET

32:14.260 --> 32:15.693
IF YOU PUT
YOUR PANTS BACK ON.

32:15.730 --> 32:17.129
[gasp5]

32:20.600 --> 32:22.989
DUDE, PLEASE COVER
YOUR JUNK.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.462
PROBABLY JUST A BREAKER.

32:27.010 --> 32:28.307
BACK IN A FLASH.

32:30.640 --> 32:33.040
YOU GUYS AREN'T AFRAID
OF THE DARK, ARE YOU?

32:40.090 --> 32:41.318
THANK YOU.

32:47.690 --> 32:48.691
CARLTON...

32:48.730 --> 32:50.254
LET'S NOT.

32:50.300 --> 32:53.326
YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN COMING
FOR A LONG TIME.

32:53.370 --> 32:56.191
HONESTLY, LET'S JUST SKIP
THIS PART.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.299
I SIGNED 'EM WHILE YOU WERE
IN THE BATHROOM.

32:58.340 --> 33:00.205
REALLY?

33:00.240 --> 33:03.175
TWO YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD HAVE
THROWN THEM IN THE FIRE.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.178
NO, TWO YEARS AGO
I WOULD HAVE LIT THEM ON FIRE

33:05.210 --> 33:07.041
AND PUT THEM BACK
IN YOUR PURSE.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.588
I DON'T THINK THIS PLACE
LIKES ME VERY MUCH.

33:29.770 --> 33:31.806
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER
STOP LOVING YOU.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.637
NOT COMPLETELY.

33:37.540 --> 33:38.643
SAY SOMETHING.

33:42.350 --> 33:44.739
WHEN...YOU FIRST LEI-T ME,

33:44.790 --> 33:46.348
I MAY HAVE HAD YOU FOLLOWED

33:46.390 --> 33:48.358
AND CALLED YOUR CELL PHONE,

33:48.390 --> 33:52.326
BUT...THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.759
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE PAST ANYMORE.

33:53.790 --> 33:56.657
IT'S ABOUT TOMORROW.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.419
SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY A WORD.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.131
BUT KNOW THAT I WANT TO.

34:01.170 --> 34:03.229
I WANNA SCREAM TO THE SKY
THAT I WOULD DO ANYTHING

34:03.270 --> 34:05.704
TO GET YOU BACK.

34:05.740 --> 34:08.208
BUT I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO.

34:08.240 --> 34:10.333
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.272
ONCE YOU
WALK OUT THAT DOOR,

34:13.310 --> 34:16.211
I'M GONNA LET GO OF EVERYTHING
I'VE BEEN HOLDING ONTO.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.774
SO WE CAN BOTH
HAVE TOMORROW.

34:20.790 --> 34:22.382
GOOD-BYE, VICTORIA.

34:22.420 --> 34:24.684
GOOD-BYE, CARLTON.

34:28.300 --> 34:38.335

[door creaking]

35:27.190 --> 35:28.657
[thunder]

35:29.920 --> 35:31.626
JASON.

35:31.660 --> 35:33.218
YOU SCARED THE CRAP
OUT OF ME.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.566
DUDE.

35:46.910 --> 35:48.639
[scream]

35:48.680 --> 35:49.772
FINALLY.

35:55.480 --> 35:58.244
[all cheer]

36:01.720 --> 36:02.755
SHAWN.

36:08.630 --> 36:09.756
I STUMBLED UPON
ERWEN'S LIVING QUARTERS,

36:09.800 --> 36:11.153
AND I MEAN THAT LOOSELY.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.229
CLIVE.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.907
SHAWN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:27.280 --> 36:29.817
I THINK WE HAVE
A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.918
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

36:43.960 --> 36:45.518
(Gus)
WHAT THE...

36:45.570 --> 36:46.525
(Shawn)
CLIVE KILLED ERWEN.

36:46.570 --> 36:47.969
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT HE DID.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.332
AND NOW HE'S OUT THERE,
AND SO ARE BILLY AND ANNIE.

36:51.870 --> 36:53.633
LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.831
I WANT YOU ALL TO STAY TOGETHER
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.529
DON'T OPEN THE DOOR
FOR ANYBODY BUT ME.

36:57.580 --> 36:58.478
I'M COMING TOO.
NO.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.478
WE CAN COVER MORE GROUND
THIS WAY.
SHAWN!

37:00.510 --> 37:01.841
WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING THIS.
THERE'S NO TIME.

37:01.880 --> 37:02.847
SHAWN.
BUDDY...

37:02.880 --> 37:04.279
IT'LL BE OKAY.

37:04.320 --> 37:05.480
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.680
YOU HOLD DOWN THE FORT.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.916
THIS IS A DISASTER.

37:10.960 --> 37:14.452
OH, I HIRE A PSYCHOPATH
TO WORK IN MY MURDER CAMP?

37:14.500 --> 37:15.990
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

37:16.030 --> 37:17.452
LET'S JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER.
NOBODY'S GETTING IN HERE.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.922
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

THAT DIED HERE 20 YEARS AGO

38:57.030 --> 38:57.951
WAS MY FATHER!

38:58.000 --> 38:59.820
OF COURSE HE WAS.

38:59.870 --> 39:01.838
AND YOU GUYS
THINK IT'S FUNNY?

39:01.870 --> 39:02.837
IT'S FUN?

39:02.870 --> 39:04.758

TALKING ABOUT?

39:36.100 --> 39:37.590
I DON'T KNOW.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.562
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A POINT.
THINGS GOT PERSONAL.

39:39.610 --> 39:40.804

39:58.560 --> 40:00.027
TAKE THE SHOT!
I DON'T HAVE IT!

40:00.060 --> 40:01.129
GET IT!
AAH!

40:01.160 --> 40:02.422
SHOOT THAT MOTHER--

40:02.460 --> 40:03.688
[gunshot]

40:06.670 --> 40:09.161
IN THE HAND!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

40:09.200 --> 40:19.440
DON'T. . . MOVE!

40:19.450 --> 40:24.945
DON'T. . . MOVE!

40:24.990 --> 40:27.208
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY,
JASON.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.013
I'M SO SORRY.
I NEVER MEANT FOR ANYBODY--

40:29.060 --> 40:30.186
WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.585
NEITHER DID I.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.599
JUST--TIME WILL HEAL.
YOU'LL SEE.

40:34.630 --> 40:36.120
JUST GET YOURSELF RIGHT.

40:38.260 --> 40:40.069
I'M GOING WITH HIM.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.034
WHY DON'T YOU
STAY HERE WITH US?

40:42.070 --> 40:43.731
I REALLY SHOULD GO.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.601
I--A|-TER ALL,

40:45.640 --> 40:48.905
HE IS MY FIANCE.

40:48.940 --> 40:50.077
WHAT?

40:59.920 --> 41:02.115
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU

41:02.160 --> 41:04.583
FOR SHOOTING THAT
WHACK JOB PSYCHO KILLER

41:04.630 --> 41:05.858
IN THE HAND.

41:05.890 --> 41:06.686
MY PLEASURE.

41:06.730 --> 41:08.595
AND I KNOW THIS
PROBABLY SOUNDS WEIRD,

41:08.630 --> 41:10.894
BUT EVEN THOUGH
I WAS REALLY SCARED

41:10.930 --> 41:13.069
AND DISCOMBOBULATED
AND WHATNOT,

41:13.100 --> 41:16.558
THAT LEVEL OF PINPOINT
MARKSMANSHIP FROM YOU

41:16.600 --> 41:18.807
IS EASILY ONE OF THE SEXIEST
THINGS THAT I'VE EVER--

41:18.840 --> 41:20.603
SHAWN...

41:20.640 --> 41:24.132
SHH.

41:24.180 --> 41:25.647
OKAY.

41:32.850 --> 41:36.081
HOW COULD SOMETHING
SO UGLY HAPPEN HERE?

41:36.120 --> 41:39.658
JUST DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

41:39.690 --> 41:41.658
LAST LOOKS, GUS.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.622
IT'LL BE A COLD DAY
IN HELL BEFORE WE--

41:43.660 --> 41:44.797
I'M SORRY I DITCHED YOU

41:44.830 --> 41:47.719
AND MADE A PINATA
WITH JASON CUNNINGHAM.

41:52.240 --> 41:54.970
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.812
