- Yeah. Sorry, little buddy.

Oh, that's nice.

No, I'm sure "sorry"

I'll shoot him.

So you think I should spend
more time with Woody?

05:12.367 --> 05:13.863
- Absolutely.
- And once he gets

05:13.864 --> 05:16.000
to know me better and
we become best friends,

05:16.132 --> 05:17.811
he'll invite me
to his big ceremony?

sure to use lots of rap lingo.

with a better health care plan.

- Maybe I will.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.132
Why the hell
did you vote for Obama anyway?

06:07.167 --> 06:10.132
Because income inequality is
a very significant social issue,

06:10.167 --> 06:12.947
and it's reinforced by a series
of regressive tax reforms

wash that lesson down

19:25.874 --> 19:28.839
- with some delicious crab cakes?
- Oh, great idea, Malloy.

19:29.839 --> 19:31.839
No, Steve, no!
I'm highly allerg...

19:31.874 --> 19:32.839
[vomiting]

19:34.589 --> 19:37.589
- Hey, Bobby.
- I told you, Bodean, I'm flat broke.

19:37.624 --> 19:39.589
- I can't take you to the doctor.
- That's okay, Bobby.

19:39.624 --> 19:41.589
The pain will go away
when I bleed out and die.

19:41.624 --> 19:44.589
I sure do wish you had dependable
health coverage like I do.

19:44.624 --> 19:46.589
I didn't know
you had health insurance.

19:46.624 --> 19:48.589
Yeah, after I spent all
that money on your medical bills

19:48.624 --> 19:50.589
and went broke,
I qualified for Obamacare.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.293
It's awesome.

19:52.589 --> 19:54.589
Too bad there ain't no way
to get on your policy.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.589
Well, there is one way.

19:56.624 --> 19:59.589
I now pronounce you
husband and husband.

19:59.624 --> 20:01.289
Have fun in hell.

20:01.589 --> 20:02.589
[Cheers and applause]

20:02.624 --> 20:04.589
Well, good news, Bodean,

20:04.624 --> 20:06.632
you got insurance now, because
we're officially married.

20:07.589 --> 20:10.589
It ain't official
until we consummate it.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.589
[Screaming]

20:18.589 --> 20:19.589
Connie, you're lucky
they didn't commit you.

20:19.624 --> 20:21.589
I was telling the truth
the whole time.

20:21.624 --> 20:23.589
Barack really does want me.

20:23.624 --> 20:25.589
[Cell phone ringing]

20:25.624 --> 20:26.589
Hello?

20:27.466 --> 20:29.589
Connie, I'm sorry
I got swept away last night.

20:29.624 --> 20:31.589
I'll be back
for that flappy ass soon.

20:31.624 --> 20:34.589
In the meantime, I sent
a present to tide you over.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.589
Let me guess.
That was "Barry," right?

20:36.624 --> 20:39.589
Yep, and he said
he sent me a present.

20:39.624 --> 20:41.589
I wonder what it could...
[Cell phone beeps]

20:41.624 --> 20:45.589
Ew. Gross.
Obama sent me a dick pic.

20:45.624 --> 20:49.589
- It's just a black screen.
- It's a close up.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.321
[Screams]
