SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN PATROL GOT HERE.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.750
- CAUGHT A BUNCH OF SCUM
CUTTING OUT.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.920
- HAVE CSU CHECK THEIR CLOTHES
FOR STAINS, BAG THEIR HANDS.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.489
THIS ENTIRE CLUB
IS A CRIME SCENE.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.291
ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES
THAT AREN'T WASTED?

02:03.324 --> 02:05.393
- BRIT, I NEED YOU
TO TAKE A BREATH.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.727
- [panting]
OH, MY GOD. [coughs]

02:06.760 --> 02:10.598
- TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.
- UM...

02:10.631 --> 02:12.933
GABBY JUST DISAPPEARED
INTO THE CROWD.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.203
I WAS HOLDING HER HAND,
AND SHE GOT PULLED AWAY

02:15.236 --> 02:17.605
AND SHE--SHE LET GO.
CAN I GO TO THE HOSPITAL?

02:17.638 --> 02:20.241
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? HER FATHER
IS ON HIS WAY THERE NOW, OKAY?

02:20.274 --> 02:22.576
YOU'RE GONNA COME WITH ME TO THE
STATION AND MAKE A STATEMENT.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.245
- GABBY'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.546
WE DROVE IN TOGETHER
FROM NEW CANAAN.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.281
- WERE YOU WITH HER
WHEN THE ATTACK BEGAN?

02:27.315 --> 02:29.317
- YEAH, WE WERE DANCING
WITH OUR FRIEND BRIT,

02:29.350 --> 02:31.652
AND THERE WERE FIREWORKS
THAT WENT OFF ONSTAGE,

02:31.685 --> 02:33.321
EVERYBODY WENT CRAZY.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.589
NEXT THING WE KNEW,
GABBY WAS SUCKED INTO THE CROWD.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.391
- COULDN'T GET WITHIN
10 FEET OF THAT GIRL.

02:37.425 --> 02:41.262
IT WAS BOOGIE DARK IN THERE.
IT WAS LIKE A PACK OF DOGS.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.364
- JUST TWO OF YOU WORKING
THE WHOLE CLUB?

02:43.397 --> 02:46.234
- PROMOTERS THINK SECURITY
KILLS THE VIBE.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.236
THE BAND HIRED US.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.238
- YOU SEE WHO GRABBED HER?
- ALL OF 'EM.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.240
THEY TORE HER CLOTHES OFF.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.375
AND I TRIED TO GO IN
AND GET HER,

02:54.408 --> 02:57.245
BUT I GOT CLOCKED
WITH A BOTTLE.

03:54.602 --> 03:54.868
.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.036
- GABBY SHAW--BROKEN WRIST, TORN
LIGAMENTS IN HER RIGHT FOOT,

03:57.338 --> 03:58.972
RIGHT ACL IS RUPTURED.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.741
SCRATCHES, CONTUSIONS,
BITE MARKS ALL OVER HER BODY.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.743
- EMT SAID SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN THEY ARRIVED ON THE SCENE?

04:02.776 --> 04:04.278
- SHE STILL IS.
SHE'S CONCUSSED.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.145
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THE RAPE KIT?

04:05.178 --> 04:06.880
- MULTIPLE MOUTH
AND VAGINAL LACERATIONS,

04:06.914 --> 04:08.416
TRAUMA TO HER CERVIX.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.418
THEY USED THEIR HANDS,
BEER BOTTLES.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.852
- OH--
WHAT ABOUT DNA?

04:11.885 --> 04:13.587
- NO SEMEN.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.923
BUT WE PULLED SAMPLES FROM
THE BITE MARKS AND SCRATCHES.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.558
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN SHE COMES TO.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.059
- WHERE'S GABBY SHAW?
WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER?

04:19.092 --> 04:20.594
I NEED TO SEE HER.
- UH, SIR,

04:20.628 --> 04:22.730
SHE'S IN RECOVERY.
I CAN TAKE YOU THERE.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.399
- THIS IS BARBARIC.
YOU'VE ARRESTED THESE MEN?

04:25.433 --> 04:27.435
- WE HAVE SUSPECTS IN CUSTODY,
BUT JUST A FEW QUESTIONS.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.370
- I SHOULD HAVE NEVER LET HER
GO INTO THE CITY.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.405
- DID YOU KNOW THE FRIENDS
THAT SHE CAME IN WITH?

04:31.439 --> 04:32.606
- THEY ASKED HER
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.475
BRIT AND THAT BOY JAKE--
HE'S A DISGRACE.

04:34.508 --> 04:35.976
HE COULD'VE STOPPED THEM.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.545
- WELL, IT'S HARD
TO HOLD OFF A MOB.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.480
- I TOLD HER
TO STAY HOME AND STUDY,

04:39.513 --> 04:41.349
BUT SHE'S THE NEW GIRL, SHE
WANTS TO BE EVERYBODY'S FRIEND.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.916
- SO SHE'S NEW
AT HER HIGH SCHOOL.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.752
- LAST YEAR, WE MOVED HERE
FROM--FROM YORKSHIRE.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.721
MY--MY COMPANY MOVED ME--US.
THEY SAID--[chuckles]

04:47.755 --> 04:50.090
THEY SAID CONNECTICUT
AND NEW CANAAN WOULD BE SAFE.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.361
- WE GO TO WOODMERE HIGH.
ME, JAKE, GABBY.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.729
GABBY WANTED TO STAY HOME.
I CONVINCED HER TO GO OUT.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.499
WE HAVE THIS STUPID SENIOR DARE.
"YOLO," IT MEANS--

04:58.532 --> 05:00.834
- YEAH, "YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE."
I HEARD IT.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.470
IT'S USUALLY AN EXCUSE
TO DO SOMETHING--

05:02.503 --> 05:04.071
both: DUMB.
- YEAH.

05:04.104 --> 05:07.341
- WE WERE DANCING,
AND THIS FREAK WITH CURLY HAIR,

05:07.375 --> 05:09.477
HE TRIED TO PUT
THE MOVES ON GABBY.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.345
- REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HIM?

05:11.379 --> 05:14.948
- HE HAD A NOSE RING.
- WAS HE PART OF THE MOB?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.885
- HE MUST'VE BEEN
THE ONE THAT STARTED IT.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.086
- JUST 'CAUSE YOU GOT
A JACKET ON ME,

05:19.119 --> 05:20.988
YOU THINK
I RAPED THAT SKANK?

05:21.021 --> 05:24.725
- WE ALSO HAVE WITNESSES
THAT SAW YOU ALL OVER THE GIRL.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.461
- WHAT WAS SHE DOING DANCING
WITH HER SHIRT OFF?

05:27.495 --> 05:30.631
HER BODACIOUS TA-TAS
JIGGLING FOR EVERYONE TO SEE?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.866
NAH, SHE WANTED IT.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.135
- CAN YOU DESCRIBE
ANYBODY ELSE?

05:35.168 --> 05:39.940
- ONE GUY HAD
AN ARM TATTOO AND...

05:39.973 --> 05:42.042
ANOTHER GUY HAD A FOHAWK.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.445
HE GRABBED GABBY'S BREASTS.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.380
- YOU GOTTA SPIN
A DIFFERENT TALE.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.981
- THERE WERE LIKE
A HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.617
- BIG CROWD,
YOU GOT CAUGHT UP,

05:49.650 --> 05:51.919
MAYBE DID SOMETHING
YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO?

05:51.952 --> 05:54.422
- LOOK, SOMETHING JUST...
SNAPPED, OKAY?

05:54.455 --> 05:56.824
- GO ON.
- I GOT SWEPT UP.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.159
THE MUSIC,
THAT GIRL TOPLESS...

05:59.192 --> 06:01.028
I TOUCHED HER,
BUT NOTHING ELSE, I SWEAR.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.063
YOU GOTTA HELP ME.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.832
- I DIDN'T GO NEAR THAT GIRL.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.501
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING, HOTSHOT?
ALL THAT INK...

06:07.535 --> 06:10.704
MAKES YOU HARD TO MISS,
AND JURIES LOVE DETAILS.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.906
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
SWEETHEART?

06:12.940 --> 06:15.709
I THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING
A NICE CONVERSATION.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.179
STRAIGHT TO A JURY?
I GO STRAIGHT TO A LAWYER.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.948
- A NEW CANAAN
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

06:20.981 --> 06:24.017
STILL UNCONSCIOUS
FROM A MOB ASSAULT.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.619
BLOOMBERG'S SPLENETIC.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.622
- I'VE BEEN FIELDING CALLS
ALL NIGHT FROM 1PP.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.791
THEY WANT CHARGES NOW.
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.726
- EYEWITNESSES
AND CELL PHONE VIDEO CONFIRM

06:32.760 --> 06:34.695
THAT GABBY
WAS JUST SWEPT AWAY.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.129
I MEAN, THINGS ESCALATED,

06:36.163 --> 06:37.765
TURNED VIOLENT WITHIN
A MATTER OF SECONDS.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.166
- IT'S MOB MENTALITY.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.167
THEY'RE WAY MORE
AGGRESSIVE TOGETHER

06:40.200 --> 06:41.602
THAN THEY WOULD BE ALONE.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.070
- THESE SIX ARRESTED
AT THE SCENE?

06:43.103 --> 06:45.005
- UNIS PICKED THEM UP
WHEN THEY WERE FLEEING.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.908
- GABBY'S FRIENDS I.D.ed THEM
AS PULLING HER INTO THE CROWD.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.176
- YEAH, BUT THEY ALL INSIST
THAT IT WAS THE CROWD SURGE

06:49.209 --> 06:51.078
THAT PUSHED THEM
INTO THE VICTIM.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.680
THEY'RE NOT THE ONES
THAT ACTUALLY ATTACKED HER.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.682
- CAN YOU CHARGE THESE MOOKS
WITH ANYTHING?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.183
- I'D LIKE A LITTLE
STRONGER EVIDENCE.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.685
WELL, THE VIDEO'S USELESS.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.787
UNLESS YOU GUYS
SEE SOMETHING I DON'T.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.523
- ARMS, LEGS, GROPING.
NO FACES.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.091
- AND WHAT ABOUT DNA?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.693
- HER BODY IS COVERED
WITH SAMPLES.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.227
BITE MARKS, SCRATCHES.
- EXACTLY.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.163
SHE'S A VERITABLE DNA COCKTAIL.
MONTHS TO SEPARATE OUT.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.232
AND EVEN THEN IT ONLY PROVES
PROXIMITY, NOT INTENT.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.101
- OKAY, SO WE JUST LET
HALF A DOZEN BOYS

07:14.134 --> 07:16.136
GET AWAY WITH A BRUTAL
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.171
- EVERY ONE OF THESE SUSPECTS
IS GONNA BLAME THE OTHER GUY.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.940
THE JURY'S NOT GONNA KNOW
HOW TO PARSE IT.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.642
[cell phone chimes]
- OH, HERE'S OUR FIRST PIECE

07:21.675 --> 07:23.844
OF GOOD NEWS--
GABBY'S AWAKE.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.046
WE'LL SHOW HER
A PHOTO ARRAY.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.682
INCLUDE EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT
WAS IN THAT CLUB LAST NIGHT.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.050
- GET ME SOMETHING,

07:30.083 --> 07:33.153
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW
ALL WE HAVE IS A MOB SCENE.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.655
- THERE WERE
SO MANY OF THEM.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.858
LAUGHING, HURTING ME.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.127
GRABBING MY BREASTS.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.664
PUTTING THEIR FINGERS
INSIDE ME.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.867
- I'M SO SORRY, GABBY.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.135
WE JUST NEED TO KNOW,
THOUGH,

07:48.168 --> 07:50.938
IF YOU RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THESE FACES.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.841
- HIM, MAYBE.
I REMEMBER A NOSE RING.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.776
- YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE DID TO YOU?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.511
- HE WAS GRINDING ON ME,

07:57.545 --> 07:58.912
AND THEN I FELT SOMEBODY
PULL MY TOP DOWN.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.014
- OKAY, WAS IT HIM?

08:01.048 --> 08:03.517
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS FROM BEHIND.

08:03.551 --> 08:07.220
- OKAY. LET'S KEEP GOING.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.889
- MAYBE HIM.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.091
EARLIER AT THE BAR...

08:11.124 --> 08:13.594
IT WAS DARK.
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.162
- I KNOW THIS IS HARD,
GABBY.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.532
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT WAS
THE WAY HE SMELLED

08:18.566 --> 08:20.000
OR SOMETHING
ABOUT HIS VOICE.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.236
ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER
CAN BE HELPFUL.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.106
OKAY, LET'S KEEP GOING.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.741
- HIM.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.710
I SAW HIM AT THE FRONT
OF THE STAGE.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.144
HE WAS WORKING SECURITY.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.047
- HIM?

08:34.081 --> 08:36.083
HE TOLD US THAT
HE TRIED TO HELP YOU.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.851
- HELP ME? NO.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.921
I SAW HIM COMING,
AND I THOUGHT, "THANK GOD,"

08:40.954 --> 08:44.858
BUT THEN HE STOPPED.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.060
HIS EYES WENT COLD,

08:47.094 --> 08:50.598
AND HE JUMPED
RIGHT ON TOP OF ME.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.673
- THE SECURITY GUARD FRANK

08:59.707 --> 09:01.575
SAID HE DIDN'T GET
WITHIN 10 FEET OF GABBY.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.143
- AND I GUESS
IT'S HARD TO CONTROL A MOB

09:03.176 --> 09:05.245
WHEN YOU'RE PART OF IT.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.147
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT?
OVER IN THE BACK.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.117
- HEY, FRANK PATTERSON?
WE NEED TO TALK.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.085
- GET BACK!
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

09:12.119 --> 09:13.654
- FRANK! DON'T DO THIS!

09:13.687 --> 09:15.956
HEY!
- WATCH IT!

09:19.126 --> 09:20.628
- NO! NO!

09:20.661 --> 09:22.630
- HOW ABOUT YOU SETTLE DOWN?
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

09:22.663 --> 09:25.165
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING?
YOU WANNA BE NEXT?

09:25.198 --> 09:27.668
WE GOTTA GO! NOW!

09:35.275 --> 09:35.743
.

09:35.776 --> 09:36.443
- I'M SORRY.
- SORRY FOR WHAT?

09:38.211 --> 09:39.647
HURTING THE GIRL,
LYING TO US, RUNNING AWAY...

09:39.680 --> 09:41.715
- FRANK, SIT DOWN.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.283
LOOK, THERE'S A LOT
OF HEAT ON THIS.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.918
WE KNOW YOU'RE EX-MILITARY.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.954
- YES, SIR.
75th RANGER REGIMENT.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.922
- HONORABLE DISCHARGE,
NO RECORD.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.190
YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.960
IF YOU COOPERATE,
IT COULD HELP ALL OF US.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.828
NOW, YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T GET NEAR GABBY?

09:54.862 --> 09:58.632
- THE CROWD--

09:58.666 --> 10:00.300
I TRIED.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.969
- 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT
WHAT SHE TOLD US.

10:02.002 --> 10:05.238
SHE SAID THAT YOU WERE
ON TOP OF HER.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.709
- SHE SAID THAT.
- YEAH.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.044
- I GOTTA STAND.
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.413
- [bangs table]
THIS ISN'T ME.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.784
- WH--WHAT?
WHAT'S NOT YOU?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.952
- PLEASE, I-I GOTTA
GET OUTTA HERE.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.821
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU WANNA LEAVE?

10:20.854 --> 10:24.057
YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED
WITH GABBY.

10:24.091 --> 10:27.027
- JUST THE TRUTH, FRANK.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.831
- [exhales]

10:30.864 --> 10:33.000
I MUST'VE CHECKED OUT
FOR A SECOND.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.903
- REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING WITH?

10:39.206 --> 10:43.010
- IF SHE SAYS THAT I WAS ON TOP
OF HER, I GUESS THAT I WAS.

10:45.713 --> 10:49.149
BECAUSE WHEN I--WHEN I
CLOSE MY EYES I CAN--I CAN...

10:49.182 --> 10:51.284
SEE MYSELF
ON TOP OF HER.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.765
- TAKE YOUR TIME, GABBY.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.302
- I DON'T NEED TO.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.104
IT'S NUMBER THREE.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.944
THOSE EYES...

11:18.445 --> 11:19.947
- [knocks three times]
- THANK YOU, MISS SHAW.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.248
- OKAY,
WOULD YOU MIND WAITING

11:21.281 --> 11:22.916
IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM
FOR A MINUTE?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.151
- HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.254
I WANT THOSE MEN TO PAY
FOR WHAT THEY DID.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.957
- SO THE SECURITY GUARD
IS IN ON IT? THAT'S JUST GREAT.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.725
- A SOLID VICTIM I.D.,
A CONFESSION...

11:31.759 --> 11:33.827
- ABOUT THE CONFESSION,
IT WASN'T CLEAR-CUT.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.196
- SHE I.D.ed HIM OUT OF A PHOTO
ARRAY AND RIGHT HERE, NICK.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.831
- HE WAIVED HIS RIGHT TO
COUNSEL, HE SIGNED A CONFESSION,

11:37.865 --> 11:39.299
HE'S BEEN I.D.ed.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.034
THANK YOU, GOOD-BYE.
ONE DOWN, REST TO GO.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.203
- WHERE ARE WE ON THE OTHER
SUSPECTS IN CUSTODY?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.472
- TWO GROPERS WOULD FOLD
ON A LESSER CHARGE.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.141
THE ORIGINAL THREE--NOSE RING,
FOHAWK, TATTOO--HOLDING TIGHT.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.910
- PROBABLY BECAUSE
THEY STARTED IT.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.478
I MEAN, LISTEN, GABBY REMEMBERS
BEING AT THE CLUB,

11:51.511 --> 11:52.913
BUT SHE'S A LITTLE FUZZY

11:52.946 --> 11:54.748
ON WHETHER THEY WERE
PART OF THE ATTACK.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.083
- LINE 'EM UP,
SEE IF IT TRIGGERS

11:56.116 --> 11:57.785
ANYTHING ELSE IN HER MEMORY,
AND MAYBE WE'LL

11:57.818 --> 11:59.987
SCARE THE REST OF THEM
INTO CONFESSING.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.468
- IT'S NUMBER FIVE.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.838
- [knocks five times]

12:20.841 --> 12:23.010
- IT'S NUMBER FOUR.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.020
NUMBER TWO.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.299
- NUMBER FOUR.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.835
- SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

12:47.868 --> 12:49.536
- YOUR DAUGHTER DID GREAT.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.571
WE'RE GONNA CHARGE
THESE MEN WITH ASSAULT.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.073
- YEAH, BUT WHAT
ABOUT THE OTHERS?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.975
- LOOK, I KNOW THAT
THIS IS FRUSTRATING,

12:55.008 --> 12:57.510
BUT WE'RE WORKING TO MAKE
THE CASE AS STRONG AS WE CAN.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.948
WE WANT TO GET A JURY TO CONVICT
EVERYONE WHO DID THIS.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.516
- JURY? NO. NO, I DON'T WANT MY
DAUGHTER TESTIFYING IN PUBLIC.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.352
- WELL, ONE THING AT A TIME,
MR. SHAW.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.956
I THINK RIGHT NOW, GABBY NEEDS
TO FOCUS ON GETTING BETTER.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.859
- LET'S GET YOU
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.261
- DADDY, I LEFT MY BAG
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.501
- [exhales]

13:21.534 --> 13:23.436
- DOES IT EVER GET BETTER?

13:26.606 --> 13:30.878
EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES,
I'M BACK IN THAT MOB.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.946
THOSE GUYS ALL OVER ME.

13:32.980 --> 13:36.249
THE MUSIC, THE LIGHTS FLASHING,
I CAN'T GET AWAY.

13:36.283 --> 13:39.352
- GABBY, YOU'VE ALREADY
MADE IT THROUGH HELL.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.322
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO CAN HELP YOU.

13:42.355 --> 13:46.226
AND YOU--
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.230
- [sniffles]

13:50.263 --> 13:52.900
I WANT TO GO HOME.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.035
BE WITH MY FRIENDS.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.971
HAVE THINGS BACK
THE WAY THEY WERE.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.411
- HEY, I'M NOT
GETTING IN THERE.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.413
- THERE A PROBLEM?

14:06.446 --> 14:07.547
- I SAID I'M NOT
GETTING IN THERE.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.982
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.550
GET IN THERE
AND SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.985
- HEY, IS THAT NECESSARY?
- GET IN THERE AND SHUT YOUR--

14:12.019 --> 14:13.420
- HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

14:13.453 --> 14:15.055
- HEY, YO, YO, YO, YO, YO!
- SETTLE DOWN!

14:15.088 --> 14:16.589
- TAKE IT EASY, MAN!
- HE WENT OFF ON ME!

14:16.623 --> 14:18.491
YOU SAW HIM!
- HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT, FRANK?

14:18.525 --> 14:21.428
- UH...

14:21.461 --> 14:23.430
UH, THERE'S NO MOON.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.633
VISIBILITY'S DOWN.

14:26.666 --> 14:31.571
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
IS GONNA HAPPEN. OKAY?

14:31.604 --> 14:33.606
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
I GET IT.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.908
HEY, I NEED HIM
BACK IN MY CUSTODY.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.143
- NICK--

14:36.176 --> 14:37.577
- HE ASSAULTED
A FELLOW OFFICER.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.645
I HAVE TO ASK HIM
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.948
UNLOCK HIM.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:40.981 --> 14:45.352
HE'S YOUR PROBLEM NOW,
BUDDY.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.154
- YOU BROUGHT
FRANK PATTERSON BACK?

14:47.187 --> 14:48.621
- YEAH.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.924
HE LOST IT AT THE VAN.
I RECOGNIZED THE SIGNS--

14:50.958 --> 14:52.059
- OF A THUG WHO DOESN'T
WANT TO DO THE TIME, OR--

14:52.092 --> 14:54.061
- OF A SOLDIER WITH PTSD?

14:54.094 --> 14:56.529
- WHAT? OH, C--
- BACK UP, BOTH OF YOU.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.031
NOW WHAT?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.700
- FRANK, HE HAS A FEAR
OF CLOSED SPACES.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.302
THE DARK WITH NO MOON.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.937
LOOK, HE DID THREE TOURS
IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN--

15:03.971 --> 15:05.372
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I APPRECIATE THAT, OKAY?

15:05.405 --> 15:08.208
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HIS CRIME.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.043
- IF HE COMMITTED A CRIME.
- OH, COME ON, NICK.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.378
YOU WERE IN THERE.
HE CONFESSED.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.379
- NO, YOU GAVE HIM
GABBY'S ACCOUNT.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.181
HE PARROTED IT BACK.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.515
"I DON'T REMEMBER,
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID--"

15:15.548 --> 15:16.516
- NO, NO, NO,
I DID NOT COERCE HIM.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.185
YOU KNOW THAT.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.187
GABBY I.D.ed HIM, HE ADMITTED
THAT HE WAS AT FAULT.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.689
- AND HE'S PUNISHING HIMSELF.
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GUILTY.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.392
- HOLD ON.
I WANT THIS THING ROCK-SOLID.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.027
DO YOU WANNA GO OVER IT
WITH HIM AGAIN?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.361
- HE WAS THERE.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.998
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID
OR WHAT HE SAW.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.033
BUT MY GUT--WE DON'T HAVE
HIS WHOLE STORY.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.401
- OH, YOUR GUT. GOOD LORD.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.536
- ROLLINS, PROBLEM?

15:36.569 --> 15:37.937
- NO, SERGEANT.

15:48.715 --> 15:53.453
- I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS IN FALLUJAH.

15:53.486 --> 15:57.424
EVERYTHING FELT LIKE IT CAME
WITH A SIDE ORDER OF SAND.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.426
- YOU WERE THERE?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.694
- INTERROGATIONS
AFTER 9/11.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.765
- SO...YOU KNOW.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.635
- WELL, NOT HALF
OF WHAT YOU DO.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.071
YOU WERE A RANGER.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.640
YOU MUST'VE BEEN IN SOME

16:13.673 --> 16:15.775
PRETTY INTENSE SITUATIONS.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.677
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE TRAINED FOR.

16:17.710 --> 16:21.714
- FOR THE BATTLE, YEAH.

16:21.748 --> 16:26.419
NOT FOR COMING HOME.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.755
IS THERE ANYTHING...

16:28.788 --> 16:31.091
ANYTHING YOU CAN'T SHAKE?

16:31.124 --> 16:34.327
- I DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.404
- WHERE'D YOU GO?

16:47.807 --> 16:50.810
- TIKRIT.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.381
NIGHT RAID.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.816
I HAD A BAD FEELING.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.652
WE JUST GOT DONE
CLEARING THE FIRST HOUSE

16:59.686 --> 17:03.490
WHEN WE GOT RADIOED THAT
A SOLDIER WAS DOWN IN AN ALLEY.

17:03.523 --> 17:08.328
I WAS ON SNIPER DETAIL,
SO MY BUDDY AL WENT.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.763
AN IED GOT HIM.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.635
IT WAS JUST JENNA AND ME.

17:15.668 --> 17:20.140
SHE WAS ASSIGNED TO OUR UNIT
FOR THE MISSION.

17:20.173 --> 17:23.443
I NAILED HER SNIPER.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.813
BUT SHE BLED OUT
IN MY ARMS...

17:26.846 --> 17:29.649
BECAUSE I WAS TOO LATE.

17:29.682 --> 17:34.321
- LIKE IT WAS TOO LATE
TO HELP GABBY.

17:34.354 --> 17:38.791
- I SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN THERE SOONER.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.727
BUT THAT BAND'S FLARE
WAS LIKE...

17:40.760 --> 17:43.296
*

17:43.330 --> 17:46.366
THAT FIRST IED.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.136
*

17:49.169 --> 17:53.106
PEOPLE SPRINTING.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.276
LUGGING CANS,
SCRAMBLING FOR AN INCH OF COVER.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.279
- NOW, WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU SAW GABBY?

18:00.680 --> 18:04.717
- I REMEMBER NOW.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.787
I JUMPED ON TOP OF HER.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.490
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
SHE WAS JENNA.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.126
- YOU WERE TRYING
TO PROTECT HER?

18:13.160 --> 18:17.497
- YEAH.
BUT I WAS TOO LATE.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.333
I LET THAT GUY GET AWAY.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.135
- YOU LET
WHAT GUY GET AWAY?

18:22.169 --> 18:24.804
- THE GUY WHO STARTED IT.

18:24.837 --> 18:28.808
PALE FACE. HIP-HOP T-SHIRT.

18:30.810 --> 18:35.682
I SAW HIM PULL HER TOP DOWN.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.586
AND I DIDN'T EVEN STOP IT.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.388
- IT'S OKAY, FRANK.

18:54.334 --> 18:54.601
.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.202
- PALE FACE. HIP-HOP SHIRT.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.239
THAT'S THE KID FRANK REMEMBERS
SEEING START THE MOB.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.840
- NOW,
HOW'D THE KID DO THAT?

19:00.873 --> 19:03.510
- PULLED GABBY'S TUBE TOP DOWN,
PUSHED HER INTO THE CROWD.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.711
FRANK DESCRIBED HIM EXACTLY.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.646
- HE IS ALONE,
AND FROM THE TIME STAMP,

19:06.679 --> 19:09.482
HE LEFT THE CLUB
BEFORE ANYONE CALLED 911.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.518
- AND FIN'S AT THE CLUB
WITH HIS PIC.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.586
- AND THIS IS FRANK'S
LATEST VERSION,

19:13.620 --> 19:16.323
SO HE RETRACTED THAT HE WAS
PART OF THE ASSAULT.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.691
- NO, HE DIDN'T
ATTACK GABBY.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.959
HE WAS TRYING TO SAVE HER.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.229
HIS...

19:22.262 --> 19:25.198
HIS PTSD WAS TRIGGERED
BY THE PYROTECHNICS,

19:25.232 --> 19:26.399
HIS VISION TUNNELED DOWN.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.901
HE THOUGHT GABBY
WAS A WOUNDED SOLDIER.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.271
ONCE WE TALKED IT THROUGH,
HIS MEMORY CAME BACK.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.273
- THAT'S NOT HOW GABBY
REMEMBERS IT.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.841
GABBY I.D.ed FRANK.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.576
- WE'RE NOT RELEASING HIM.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.577
AND IF WE CHARGE HIM
WITH ANYTHING

19:37.610 --> 19:38.845
HE HAS TO TAKE A PSYCH EVAL.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.580
YOU FIND ANYTHING
AT THE CLUB?

19:40.613 --> 19:43.750
- GUY AT THE DOOR REMEMBERS
THE HIP-HOP T-SHIRT BUT NO NAME.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.719
HE SAYS THE I.D. SAID
18 FROM NEW CANAAN.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.356
- ANOTHER KID FROM NEW CANAAN.
SEEM LIKE COINCIDENCE?

19:49.389 --> 19:51.558
HOW MANY PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS
ARE THERE IN NEW CANAAN--TWO?

19:51.591 --> 19:52.925
- ONE.
- WELL, HE SHOULD BE

19:52.959 --> 19:54.427
EASY TO FIND.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.828
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
TAKE A RIDE,

19:55.862 --> 19:58.565
AND MAYBE YOU COULD
MAKE UP ALONG THE WAY?

19:58.598 --> 20:00.867
- THIS GUY FRANK--

20:00.900 --> 20:02.902
IT WAS COMING OVER HIM
LIKE A WAVE.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.571
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.
- OKAY.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.539
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
- YEAH.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.408
- YOU TELL HIM
THAT YOU WERE IN IRAQ?

20:08.441 --> 20:09.676
- IT CAME UP.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.511
- BEFORE OR AFTER
HE MANIFESTED PTSD?

20:11.544 --> 20:13.280
- ALL RIGHT,
COME ON, ROLLINS.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.014
- ALL I'M SAYING, IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT HE'S PLAYING YOU?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.549
IT CAN HAPPEN.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.418
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, AND NO.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.554
WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.392
- I HEARD
WHAT HAPPENED TO GABBY.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.461
AWFUL.
I LEFT BEFORE IT STARTED.

20:28.495 --> 20:32.365
- WELL, ACTUALLY, NO.
WE CHECKED SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.966
YOU LEFT
JUST AFTER IT STARTED.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.603
- DID I?
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.271
- NO?
IT'S FUNNY.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.739
A WITNESS SAW YOU
PULL HER TOP DOWN

20:39.772 --> 20:41.408
AND PUSH HER INTO THE MOB.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.276
- WHAT?
- LOUIS, COME ON.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.911
YOU WENT TO A WILD YAKS SHOW
IN A HIP-HOP T-SHIRT.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.413
THERE'S KIND OF
A DISCONNECT THERE.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.448
YOU WEREN'T THERE
TO SEE THE BAND.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.417
NOW, WERE YOU THERE
FOLLOWING GABBY?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.352
- NO.
- NOW, LOOK. WE GET IT.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.321
MAYBE YOU LIKE HER.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.722
SHE'S A PRETTY GIRL,
YOU LOST YOUR HEAD,

20:55.755 --> 20:56.889
THINGS GOT OUTTA HAND.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.891
- WELL, NOT BECAUSE OF ME.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.361
- BECAUSE OF WHO?

21:01.394 --> 21:03.363
- THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.566
LOOK, I WAS AT THE CLUB,
AND I LEFT.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.767
I DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO GABBY.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.603
SHE BARELY KNOWS WHO I AM.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.839
- I'M NOT REALLY
FRIENDS WITH LOUIS.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.508
HE WORKS AFTER SCHOOL
AT THE PIZZA PARLOR.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.477
HE DOESN'T HAVE TIME
TO HANG OUT.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.479
- WELL, DID YOU TALK TO HIM
AT THE CLUB?

21:19.512 --> 21:21.481
- NO, I DIDN'T NOTICE HIM.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.517
- DID HE EVER ASK YOU OUT
OR FOLLOW YOU?

21:24.551 --> 21:27.354
- NO. IF ANYTHING,
HE'S KIND OF SHY.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.625
WAS HE ONE OF THE ONES?
- WE'RE NOT SURE.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.595
BUT ANOTHER SUSPECT
CLAIMS THAT HE'S THE ONE

21:35.628 --> 21:37.530
WHO PULLED
YOUR TUBE TOP DOWN.

21:37.564 --> 21:39.699
- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
REALLY NICE TO LOUIS.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.535
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT TO ME?

21:42.569 --> 21:45.572
- WELL, WE'RE HOPING
THAT YOU'LL ASK HIM.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.640
ON A PHONE CALL
THAT WE'D RECORD.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.712
- LOOK, LOUIS,
I'M NOT GONNA CALL THE COPS,

21:52.745 --> 21:54.714
BUT I KNOW THAT
YOU PULLED MY TOP DOWN.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.016
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
DID YOU WANT ME TO GET RAPED?

21:57.049 --> 21:59.051
YOU HAVE TO
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

21:59.085 --> 22:02.355
- NO, GABBY, LISTEN, IT WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN LIKE THAT.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.457
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I NEVER DID ANYTHING TO YOU.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.526
- IT WAS--IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE A PRANK.

22:06.559 --> 22:07.894
WE WERE JUST
GONNA GET A PICTURE.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.430
- "WE"? WHO?
- I CAN'T SAY.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.566
I'M NOT GONNA SNITCH.
I'M REALLY SORRY YOU GOT HURT.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.502
I SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE TALKING TO YOU.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.503
- WE CALL THAT
AN ADMISSION.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.538
- I DIDN'T HURT HER.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.707
- NO, YOU PULLED DOWN HER TOP.
YOU PUSHED HER INTO THE CROWD.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.575
THAT MAKES YOU
THE RINGLEADER

22:22.609 --> 22:24.377
OF A VICIOUS SEXUAL ASSAULT.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.913
- I LEFT THE SECOND I TUBED HER.
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.382
- WHAT'D YOU MEAN WHEN YOU TOLD
GABBY YOU WEREN'T GONNA SNITCH?

22:29.416 --> 22:31.384
- I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT THE CLUB.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.953
I WAS TALKING ABOUT BEFORE.
THE PRANK.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.655
- RIGHT, THE PRANK.
THAT WAS YOUR IDEA?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.757
YOU SAID "WE" ON THE CALL.
WHAT'D YOU MEAN BY THAT?

22:37.790 --> 22:40.460
SOMEONE ELSE WAS IN ON IT?

22:40.493 --> 22:41.561
- [bangs table]
HEY! HEY!

22:41.594 --> 22:43.463
WHAT HAPPENED TO GABBY
IN THAT CLUB

22:43.496 --> 22:45.865
IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU IN PRISON.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.701
- THE PLAN
WASN'T TO RAPE HER.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.903
HE WANTED ME
TO TOP SHARK HER.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.640
GET A PHOTO OR VIDEO,
POST IT ONLINE.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.107
EMBARRASS HER.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.576
- "HE" WHO?

22:56.609 --> 23:00.880
- ALEC PETERS.
GABBY'S EX.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.783
HE PAID ME 500 BUCKS.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.752
BUT IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

23:05.785 --> 23:09.589
THEY WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT.
- "THEY"? ALEC AND WHO ELSE?

23:09.622 --> 23:11.591
- JAKE AND BRIT.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.793
- HER FRIENDS?

23:13.826 --> 23:15.895
THE ONES WHO BROUGHT HER
TO THE CLUB?

23:15.928 --> 23:17.897
- YEAH.

23:17.930 --> 23:22.569
BRIT SAID SHE'S MAKE SURE GABBY
WORE SOMETHING WITHOUT A BRA.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.136
AND WHEN THE BAND WAS BANGING,

23:24.170 --> 23:27.574
I HAD TO PULL HER TOP DOWN
AND FORCE-FLASH HER.

23:27.607 --> 23:28.975
- AND ONE OF THEM
WAS SUPPOSED TO VIDEO?

23:29.008 --> 23:31.511
- I GUESS.

23:31.544 --> 23:35.114
I WAS GOING TO
SHARK AND RUN.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.450
I NEVER WANTED THIS TO--

23:37.484 --> 23:39.552
- WHAT?

23:41.253 --> 23:44.957
- MOST OF THE GIRLS AT THAT
SCHOOL ARE KINDA STUCK UP.

23:52.665 --> 23:53.432
- LOUIS SAID MY FRIENDS
DID THIS TO ME?

23:55.602 --> 23:57.870
- DO YOU KNOW
AN ALEC PETERS?

23:57.904 --> 24:00.740
- YEAH,
WE DATED FOR A FEW MONTHS

24:00.773 --> 24:03.543
WHEN I FIRST MOVED
TO NEW CANAAN,

24:03.576 --> 24:04.977
BUT HE GOT JEALOUS.

24:05.011 --> 24:07.179
HE WANTED TO MONITOR MY TEXTS,
MY EMAILS.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.815
- AND YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.250
HOW DID HE TAKE THAT?
DID HE MAKE THREATS?

24:11.283 --> 24:14.487
- HE SAID I WAS MAKING
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.856
THAT NOBODY DOES THAT
TO ALEC PETERS.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.191
- OKAY. SO JAKE AND BRIT.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.594
ARE THEY ALEC'S FRIENDS?
- YEAH.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.262
THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
THEIR WHOLE LIVES.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.132
SO FOR A WHILE,
THEY ICED ME OUT,

24:26.165 --> 24:29.836
SO I WAS HAPPY A FEW WEEKS AGO
WHEN THEY STARTED BEING NICE.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.504
THAT'S WHY
I WENT OUT WITH THEM,

24:31.538 --> 24:34.574
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
WE COULD BE FRIENDS.

24:34.607 --> 24:38.711
- THAT TUBE TOP
THAT YOU WERE WEARING.

24:38.745 --> 24:40.513
DID YOU PICK THAT OUT?

24:43.182 --> 24:45.151
- OH, MY GOD.

24:45.184 --> 24:48.555
OH, MY GOD.
NO.

24:58.831 --> 24:59.098
.

24:59.131 --> 24:59.431
- [panting]

25:00.767 --> 25:02.535
NOT ANOTHER
BOLOGNA SANDWICH.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.771
- NO. GOOD NEWS.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.906
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.742
- WHAT?

25:09.776 --> 25:11.177
- WE FOLLOWED UP
ON YOUR I.D.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.045
IT CHECKED OUT.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.181
- SO I'M DONE?

25:15.214 --> 25:19.686
- WELL, NOT ENTIRELY.
WE MAY NEED YOU AS A WITNESS.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.588
- I TOLD YOU
I'M NOT UP FOR THAT.

25:21.621 --> 25:24.591
- WHETHER YOU TESTIFY OR NOT,

25:24.624 --> 25:29.562
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE PTSD.

25:29.596 --> 25:32.799
YOU SHOULD GET HELP.
HERE...

25:32.832 --> 25:37.236
BEST GUY AT THE LOCAL VA.
HE'S EXPECTING YOUR CALL.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.778
COME ON.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.752
- I WOULD NEVER HURT GABBY.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.787
LOUIS IS LYING
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

25:54.821 --> 25:57.023
- HMM.
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND

25:57.056 --> 25:59.692
ANY TEXTS BETWEEN YOU AND LOUIS?
- NO. CHECK MY PHONE.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.661
- YOU DO KNOW THAT
EVEN IF YOU DELETED MESSAGES,

26:01.694 --> 26:03.796
WE CAN STILL RETRIEVE 'EM.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.833
- OKAY.
LOUIS DELIVERS PIZZA.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.135
AND MORE,
IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.270
- GO ON.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.272
- I BOUGHT SOME PRIME INDO
FOR 500.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.642
YOU MIGHT FIND THAT.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.978
- SEE, HE TOLD US THAT'S WHAT
YOU PAID HIM TO TOP SHARK GABBY.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.947
- WELL, THAT'S CRAZY.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.982
- BUT SHE DID DUMP YOU,
RIGHT?

26:23.015 --> 26:24.884
- UH, WE HOOKED UP.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.754
BUT DUMP IS SO OLD-SCHOOL.
YOU GET BORED, YOU MOVE ON.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.022
- YEAH, BUT SOMETIMES
IT'S THE ONES THAT GET AWAY

26:30.056 --> 26:31.624
YOU WANNA GET BACK AT.

26:31.658 --> 26:34.326
- NOT ME.
ALEC PETERS HAS HIS PICK.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.928
- OKAY, WELL,
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON

26:35.962 --> 26:38.831
WHY LOUIS WOULD HAVE IT
IN FOR GABBY AND YOU?

26:38.865 --> 26:40.232
- I DON'T WANNA
SOUND LIKE A JERK,

26:40.266 --> 26:42.168
BUT LOUIS LIVES
IN SECTION 8 HOUSING.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.703
EVEN IF HE DOES GRADUATE,

26:43.736 --> 26:45.872
HE GOES INTO THE ARMY
LIKE HIS BROTHER.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.907
HE'S PROBABLY JEALOUS.

26:47.940 --> 26:51.711
- SO YOU SENT THIS GROUP TEXT TO
ALEX, BRIT, AND LOUIS LAST WEEK?

26:51.744 --> 26:53.913
"WE BE READY FOR DA SHOW"?

26:53.946 --> 26:56.649
- STRIPPING GABBY
IN FRONT OF 200 STRANGERS.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.384
THAT'S A SHOW TO YOU?

26:58.417 --> 27:01.153
- NO. I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE WILD YAKS SHOW.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.389
- THEN HOW COME GABBY
WASN'T CCed AND ALEC WAS?

27:03.422 --> 27:04.691
HE DIDN'T GO.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.259
- YEAH, WELL,
WHEN HE DROPPED OUT,

27:07.293 --> 27:10.062
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
NICE TO INVITE GABBY.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.899
SORT OF LIKE A PEACE OFFERING
AFTER THE BREAKUP.

27:12.932 --> 27:16.268
- SO YOU, BRIT,
AND HER, AND LOUIS?

27:16.302 --> 27:17.904
YOU BOUGHT HIS TICKET TOO?

27:17.937 --> 27:20.106
HE USUALLY ROLL WITH YOU?

27:20.139 --> 27:23.042
- NO. BUT I OWED HIM.

27:23.075 --> 27:27.413
AND I'M GONNA
PLEAD THE FIFTH ON WHAT FOR.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.348
- I DIDN'T KNOW LOUIS
WAS EVEN THERE THAT NIGHT.

27:29.381 --> 27:32.151
HE PULLED GABBY'S TOP OFF?
- YEAH, AND IT WAS THE TOP

27:32.184 --> 27:34.020
THAT YOU TOLD HER TO WEAR.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.322
- HE'S A LOSER.
HE GOT CAUGHT.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.791
HE'S JUST PUTTING
THE BLAME ON SOMEONE ELSE.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.927
- YEAH, BUT GABBY
DID BREAK UP WITH ALEC.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.062
- I THINK IT WAS
MORE MUTUAL.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.331
AND ALEC WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.166
HE'S A GENTLEMAN.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.702
I MEAN, I TOOK COTILLION CLASS
WITH HIM IN THE FOURTH GRADE.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.403
- COTILLION CLASS?

27:51.437 --> 27:52.805
- YEAH, BALLROOM DANCE
AND SOCIAL--

27:52.839 --> 27:54.340
- ETIQUETTE.
YEAH, NO,

27:54.373 --> 27:56.776
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU GUYS HAD THAT UP HERE.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.344
BUT YOU AND ALEC.
YOU TWO NEVER DATED?

27:58.377 --> 28:01.413
- WE'RE MORE LIKE
BROTHER AND SISTER.

28:01.447 --> 28:02.448
- AHA.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.951
LIKE YOU AND JAKE.
- YEAH.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.452
WE'RE ALL OLD FRIENDS.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.855
- GABBY--
SHE WAS THE NEW GIRL.

28:08.888 --> 28:09.856
- THAT'S MY MOM.

28:09.889 --> 28:12.024
I GOTTA GO.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.731
- ALL RIGHT, SO THESE GUYS--
THIS GANG OF SIX--

28:18.765 --> 28:19.966
THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH SETTING IT UP.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.400
THEY WERE JUST OPPORTUNISTS.

28:21.433 --> 28:22.802
I KNOW THIS IS HARD TO FOLLOW,
COUNSELOR.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.004
- NO, I GET IT.
IT'S BENGHAZI.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.806
YOU THOUGHT THAT GABBY'D
BEEN ASSAULTED BY A MOB.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.507
IT TURNS OUT THE ATTACK
WAS ORCHESTRATED.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.877
THE PROBLEM IS--
- HOW TO PROVE IT,

28:30.910 --> 28:32.979
WHEN ALEC, BRIT, AND JAKE
ARE ALL IN LOCKSTEP.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.314
- THESE THREE.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.884
THE COTILLION CREW.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.418
THEY DIDN'T TOUCH GABBY?

28:39.451 --> 28:41.988
- NO, BUT THEY SET
THE WHOLE THING IN MOTION.

28:42.021 --> 28:43.790
THEY TOOK HER TO THE CLUB.

28:43.823 --> 28:47.093
AND THIS ONE PICKED OUT
THE TUBE TOP THAT GABBY WORE.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.261
- EVEN A NEW YORK GRAND JURY
WON'T INDICT FOR THAT.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.497
- [sighs]

28:51.530 --> 28:55.835
- UNLESS...

28:57.870 --> 29:01.540
ONE, TWO, THREE.

29:01.573 --> 29:05.044
WE'RE LOOKING
AT A CONSPIRACY.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.479
- WHAT? TO HARASS?
TO TOP SHARK?

29:07.513 --> 29:09.015
- YOU'VE SEPARATED
THESE TWO GROUPS OUT.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.383
I CHARGE THESE SIX
WITH AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT,

29:11.417 --> 29:14.987
THEY'RE LOOKING AT 20 YEARS.
- I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.823
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THEIR ASSAULT

29:16.856 --> 29:18.825
WAS FORESEEABLE
BY THE NEW CANAAN KIDS.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.827
- OKAY, YEAH,
BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE A STRETCH.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.529
I MEAN, WHAT, HER FRIENDS
JUST WANTED TO EMBARRASS HER.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.264
- BY EXPOSING HER BREASTS

29:25.297 --> 29:26.933
TO A BUNCH OF DRUNK,
AGGRESSIVE MEN AT A CLUB?

29:26.966 --> 29:29.401
IT'S AS FORESEEABLE AS A MURDER
AT AN ARMED ROBBERY,

29:29.435 --> 29:31.871
AND WE CHARGE THAT
ALL THE TIME.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.573
- HEY, CAN WE GET THEM
WITH LOUIS'S STATEMENT?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.008
- NO.
HE'S A COCONSPIRATOR.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.844
I NEED INDEPENDENT
CORROBORATION.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.578
BESIDES,
HE'S OUT OF THEIR LEAGUE.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.482
THESE KIDS' LAWYERS--THEY'D
DISCREDIT HIM BEFORE LUNCH.

29:43.515 --> 29:46.986
- NICK, DID YOU ASK FRANK
ABOUT BRIT AND JAKE?

29:47.019 --> 29:49.221
- NO, THEY WEREN'T SUSPECTS.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.490
AND FRANK--THE CLUB ATTACK
TRIGGERED A FLASHBACK.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.326
HIS MEMORY'S FRAGMENTED.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.263
- YOU GOT HIM
TO REMEMBER LOUIS.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.598
- YEAH.

29:59.631 --> 30:03.035
- GO BACK.
TAKE HIM THROUGH THE NIGHT.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.503
DON'T LEAD HIM,

30:04.536 --> 30:08.507
BUT SEE WHAT ELSE
HE CAN RECONSTRUCT.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.913
- I JUST GOTTA CHECK
A COUPLE THINGS.

30:13.946 --> 30:17.249
- TAKE YOUR TIME,
SERGEANT PATTERSON.

30:27.293 --> 30:32.264
- I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE MUCH HELP.

30:32.298 --> 30:35.467
I'M KIND OF A MESS,
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.403
- DID YOU CALL
THAT VA DOCTOR?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.906
- I'M KINDA TIRED.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.241
- SURE.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.475
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.476
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
I THOUGHT MAYBE,

30:44.510 --> 30:47.413
YOU KNOW, COME IN HERE,

30:47.446 --> 30:49.015
YOU COULD WALK US THROUGH
THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE NIGHT.

30:49.048 --> 30:52.651
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY. SO...

30:52.684 --> 30:58.557
FRANK, LET'S JUST START WITH,
UM, YOU KNOW, WHO WAS WHERE.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.492
DO YOU REMEMBER
ANY OF THESE KIDS?

31:00.526 --> 31:01.994
- HIM. HE WAS HERE.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.495
HE WAS THE ONE
WHO PULLED HER TOP DOWN.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.264
- ANYTHING ELSE?

31:05.297 --> 31:07.433
- UM...

31:07.466 --> 31:08.667
- THINK BACK.

31:08.700 --> 31:13.305
THE SOUNDS, THE LIGHTS,
ALL THOSE BODIES.

31:13.339 --> 31:16.875
IT MUST'VE BEEN
HOT IN THIS ROOM.

31:30.122 --> 31:33.926
- SERGEANT PATTERSON?

31:33.960 --> 31:35.294
- [sighs]

31:39.231 --> 31:43.002
SHE WHISPERED TO LOUIS.

31:43.035 --> 31:46.205
STEERED HIM OVER TO GABBY...

31:46.238 --> 31:49.541
AND THEN YELLED SOMETHING
AS SHE RAISED HER CUP.

31:49.575 --> 31:50.709
- AND DO YOU SEE THE GIRL

31:50.742 --> 31:55.414
WHO LIFTED HER CUP
IN THE COURT TODAY?

31:55.447 --> 31:57.083
- THAT'S HER.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.650
- LET THE RECORD REFLECT

31:58.684 --> 32:02.654
THAT THE WITNESS HAS IDENTIFIED
THE DEFENDANT BRIT YARDLEY.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.357
AND AFTER LOUIS
PULLED GABBY'S TOP DOWN,

32:05.391 --> 32:06.425
WHAT DID YOU SEE HIM DO?

32:06.458 --> 32:08.494
- HE PUSHED HER
INTO THE CROWD.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.999
AND THEN THAT GUY
GAVE HIM A THUMBS UP.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.067
- LET THE RECORD REFLECT
THE WITNESS HAS IDENTIFIED

32:15.101 --> 32:17.103
DEFENDANT JAKE SWENDERS.

32:17.136 --> 32:20.506
MR. PATTERSON, IT TOOK YOU SOME
TIME TO RECOLLECT THESE EVENTS.

32:20.539 --> 32:21.540
IS THAT CORRECT?
- YES, SIR.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.109
- AND THIS IS BECAUSE

32:23.142 --> 32:25.711
YOU EXPERIENCE
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS

32:25.744 --> 32:28.647
FROM YOUR THREE TOURS OF DUTY
IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.416
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
LEADING.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.750
- I'LL ALLOW IT.

32:31.783 --> 32:35.988
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:36.022 --> 32:38.757
I GUESS THAT THE...

32:38.790 --> 32:42.628
THE FIREWORKS JUST
TRIGGERED SOMETHING IN ME.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.496
BUT OVER TIME
AND TALKING IT THROUGH,

32:44.530 --> 32:46.432
I WAS ABLE TO PIECE BACK

32:46.465 --> 32:48.634
MY MEMORY OF THE NIGHT.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.269
- TALKED IT THROUGH.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.604
DID ANYONE COACH OR GUIDE
YOUR RECOLLECTIONS?

32:52.638 --> 32:54.173
- NO, SIR.

32:54.206 --> 32:57.076
LIKE I SAID, EVERYTHING CAME
BACK TO ME

32:57.109 --> 32:58.477
IN PIECES OVER TIME.

32:58.510 --> 33:03.582
AND EVERYTHING THAT I SAW
AND THAT I HEARD THAT NIGHT,

33:03.615 --> 33:07.353
I'M CERTAIN OF.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.620
AND I JUST WISH THAT I W--

33:08.654 --> 33:11.257
I WAS ABLE TO BE THERE
TO STOP IT.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.524
- THANK YOU.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.193
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.295
- LET'S STOP HERE FOR LUNCH.
RECONVENE AT 2:00.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.629
[bangs gavel]

33:19.331 --> 33:20.732
- YOU DID REALLY GOOD
UP THERE, FRANK.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.302
- YEAH, WELL,
BARBA'S ON OUR SIDE.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.704
THIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY,
HOW TOUGH IS HE?

33:25.737 --> 33:27.539
- YOU'RE PREPPED, READY.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.708
JUST TELL THE TRUTH
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.310
- WHOA, GOOD.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.412
UH, RAFAEL,
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.315
JUST A LITTLE THANK YOU GIFT.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.716
- FOR WHAT?
- WELL, NOT JUST

33:37.749 --> 33:40.052
FOR OVERREACHING
ON THE CONSPIRACY CHARGE,

33:40.086 --> 33:44.556
BUT FOR USING SOMEONE WHO HAS
PTSD FOR YOUR CENTRAL WITNESS.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.458
- "ALL THE KING'S MEN"?

33:46.492 --> 33:51.297
- COULDN'T PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

33:55.467 --> 33:59.538
JUST A FEW QUESTIONS,
SERGEANT.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.241
FIRST LET ME THANK YOU
FOR YOUR--

34:02.274 --> 34:05.611
YOUR BRAVE SERVICE
TO OUR COUNTRY.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.846
NOW, SO I'M CLEAR,

34:07.879 --> 34:09.681
INITIALLY,
YOU REMEMBERED NOTHING

34:09.715 --> 34:12.184
EXCEPT TRYING BUT FAILING

34:12.218 --> 34:13.685
TO HELP THE VICTIM?

34:13.719 --> 34:14.486
- YES, SIR.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.524
- BUT THE VICTIM
CONTRADICTED THAT?

34:18.557 --> 34:21.727
- YES, BECAUSE SHE--
- BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT

34:21.760 --> 34:23.729
YOU WERE
ONE OF HER ASSAILANTS.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.198
- THAT WAS BECAUSE
OF THE PYROTECHNICS.

34:26.232 --> 34:29.668
I DIDN'T KNOW THE BAND WAS
GOING TO USE THEM THAT NIGHT,

34:29.701 --> 34:31.537
AND I FROZE.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.340
SHE MISUNDERSTOOD
THE LOOK IN MY EYES,

34:34.373 --> 34:36.642
BUT THAT'S ALL BEEN
STRAIGHTENED OUT.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.645
- UH, NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU WERE,
UH, LESS THAN FROZEN.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.414
YOU THREW YOURSELF
ON THE VICTIM.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.250
- YES,
LIKE I EXPLAINED BEFORE,

34:44.283 --> 34:47.419
THAT'S BECAUSE I BELIEVED
THAT SHE WAS A FALLEN SOLDIER.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.821
- BUT YOU TOLD THE POLICE
YOU HAD ASSAULTED THE VICTIM.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.590
- NO.

34:51.623 --> 34:56.462
YES. I WAS CONFUSED.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.829
BUT LATER I REMEMBERED,

34:57.863 --> 35:00.299
AND I DID--YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK THAT NOW.

35:00.332 --> 35:03.202
- OH, LATER YOU BECAME
LESS CONFUSED

35:03.235 --> 35:05.704
AFTER YOU BECAME A WITNESS
FOR THE PROSECUTION.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.606
- YOUR HONOR, OBJECTION.
- OVERRULED.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.276
- IS THAT A YES
OR IS THAT A NO?

35:10.309 --> 35:13.212
- YES.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.314
I WAS CONFUSED, BUT I'M--

35:15.347 --> 35:17.583
I'M NOT CONFUSED NOW.
- OH, GOOD.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.252
AND WE'RE GLAD.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.687
BUT YOU HAVE TO
ADMIT IT'S ODD

35:21.720 --> 35:25.891
THAT, DESPITE EXTENSIVE
CELL PHONE VIDEO FOOTAGE,

35:25.924 --> 35:29.361
NO ONE--AND I MEAN NO ONE--

35:29.395 --> 35:33.832
CAPTURED
WHAT YOU SAY YOU SAW.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.434
- THAT'S--

35:35.467 --> 35:37.303
[echoing music]

35:37.336 --> 35:40.472
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.274
[echoing music]

35:44.443 --> 35:46.445
UH...

35:46.478 --> 35:49.348
THERE WAS SOMEONE,
UH, THERE VIDEOTAPING.

35:52.418 --> 35:55.387
I MEAN, I'M JUST--I'M JUST
REMEMBERING THIS NOW, BUT...

35:55.421 --> 35:57.623
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE WAS IN ON IT.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.926
- OH, I SEE. ANOTHER PERSON
YOU'RE JUST REMEMBERING.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.761
- [sighs]
- WELL, CAN YOU TELL ME...

36:02.794 --> 36:05.431
- YOUR HONOR, I JUST--
I NEED A MINUTE WITH MY WITNESS.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.633
- YOUR HONOR, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CROSS-EXAMINATION.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.536
I MEAN, DO THEY NEED A THERAPY
DOG UP THERE WITH THIS WITNESS?

36:10.569 --> 36:13.239
- CROSS WILL CONTINUE.
- NOW, AS TO...

36:13.272 --> 36:15.541
THIS OTHER PERSON TAPING,

36:15.574 --> 36:16.408
CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

36:16.442 --> 36:18.877
- SHORT, CROPPED HAIR
LIKE A SOLDIER.

36:18.910 --> 36:22.214
- LIKE A SOLDIER
YOU SERVED WITH IN IRAQ?

36:22.248 --> 36:23.682
- I EXPLAINED THAT.

36:23.715 --> 36:26.785
- YOU THOUGHT THAT THE VICTIM
WAS A FALLEN COMRADE.

36:26.818 --> 36:29.555
THE SAME WAY THAT YOU--
WELL,

36:29.588 --> 36:32.691
THAT YOU CONFUSED
THE IED AND THE BAND FLARES.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.226
IS THAT CORRECT?

36:34.260 --> 36:36.995
- I'M NOT CONFUSED ANYMORE.
- GOOD.

36:37.028 --> 36:40.399
REST OF US--
GOTTA TELL YA.

36:40.432 --> 36:41.633
WE'RE VERY CONFUSED.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.702
YOUR HONOR,

36:43.735 --> 36:48.640
I MOVE TO STRIKE SERGEANT
PATTERSON'S ENTIRE TESTIMONY.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.942
HE STARTED WITH,
"I SAW NOTHING,"

36:50.976 --> 36:52.944
HE ZIGGED TO, "I DID IT,"

36:52.978 --> 36:56.848
THEN HE DID A QUICK DETOUR
PAST "IT WAS MY CLIENTS."

36:56.882 --> 36:58.850
AND NOW, APPARENTLY,
WE'RE ENDING UP WITH,

36:58.884 --> 37:00.819
"THERE WAS A MYSTERY MAN."

37:00.852 --> 37:04.456
I DON'T THINK THE JURY
CAN GET THEIR WAY OUT OF THIS.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.492
- YOUR HONOR, PLEASE,
IT'S ALMOST 5:00.

37:06.525 --> 37:09.628
IF WE COULD JUST REQUEST
A RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.297
- I'LL GRANT YOU A REPRIEVE,
COUNSELOR.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.465
BUT BE FOREWARNED,

37:13.499 --> 37:16.368
I'M STRONGLY INCLINED
TO GRANT THE DEFENSE'S MOTION.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.013
.

37:28.046 --> 37:28.614
- YOU WERE DOING JUST FINE.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.683
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO CREATE
A WHOLE NEW SUSPECT.

37:31.717 --> 37:33.319
- I'M SORRY.
- ESPECIALLY ONE

37:33.352 --> 37:34.386
THAT NONE OF US
HAS NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.689
- COUNSELOR.
- YOUR WITNESS.

37:37.723 --> 37:41.727
- FRANK, WHAT DID HAPPEN?

37:41.760 --> 37:44.696
- THE LAWYER
SAID "VIDEOTAPING,"

37:44.730 --> 37:47.666
AND IT BROUGHT BACK
ANOTHER PIECE.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.668
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS GUY.
HE WAS THERE.

37:49.701 --> 37:50.802
- YOU SURE?

37:50.836 --> 37:52.471
HE LOOKED ARMY.
- HE DID.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.640
I SAW HIM EARLIER IN THE NIGHT,
AND I REMEMBER THINKING,

37:54.673 --> 37:56.842
"WHAT IS A POGUE
DOING IN A CLUB LIKE THIS?"

37:56.875 --> 37:58.444
- IF HE WAS THERE.
- HE WAS.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.446
I SAW HIM
VIDEOTAPING EVERYTHING.

38:00.479 --> 38:01.680
- OKAY, LET'S SAY
THAT I BELIEVE YOU.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.014
I WISH THAT YOU HAD
THOUGHT OF IT SOONER.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.550
- WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE TOO.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.084
THEY WANTED
TO EMBARRASS THIS GIRL.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.854
THE WHOLE POINT OF TOP SHARKING
IS TO VIDEOTAPE.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.722
- LOUIS GAVE UP
THE OTHER THREE CONSPIRATORS.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.391
WHY NOT HIS ACCOMPLICE?

38:12.424 --> 38:14.025
- THE GUY HAS SHORT HAIR,
LOOKED ARMY?

38:14.059 --> 38:15.761
ALEC MENTIONED

38:15.794 --> 38:18.096
LOUIS WOULD END UP IN THE ARMY
LIKE HIS BROTHER.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.065
- FIND HIM. FIND HIM FAST.

38:20.098 --> 38:23.635
OR THIS WHOLE CASE
IS JUST A MEMORY.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.406
- SO YOU HEARD ABOUT GABBY.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.074
- YES, SIR.
LOUIS TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

38:29.107 --> 38:32.411
POOR GIRL.
LOUIS IS A GOOD KID.

38:32.444 --> 38:33.912
HE JUST WANTS TO
FIT IN SOMETIMES.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.581
- YOU LOVE YOUR BROTHER,
DON'T YOU?

38:35.614 --> 38:37.483
SO IF HE ASKED YOU
TO DO A FAVOR

38:37.516 --> 38:39.451
LIKE VIDEOTAPE THAT NIGHT,
YOU'D DO IT?

38:39.485 --> 38:43.389
- I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.023
- LISTEN, WE HAVE
AN EYEWITNESS DESCRIPTION.

38:45.056 --> 38:47.025
MILITARY,
SHORT-CROPPED HAIR.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.561
WE EVEN HAVE YOUR PICTURE.

38:49.595 --> 38:52.398
- YOUR BROTHER LOVES YOU.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.032
HE LIED ON THE STAND
TO PROTECT YOU.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.768
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE,
RALPH, TO PROTECT HIM.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.107
- LOUIS SAID IT WAS JUST
RICH KIDS PULLING A DUMB PRANK.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.009
EASY MONEY.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.911
WHAT HAPPENED MADE ME SICK.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.746
- AND YOU DIDN'T HELP HER?

39:07.779 --> 39:09.047
- I JUST KEPT TAPING.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.550
I WAS A SOLDIER
FOLLOWING ORDERS.

39:11.583 --> 39:12.951
- HEY, DON'T EVEN TRY.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.420
THE SOLDIERS I WORKED WITH

39:14.453 --> 39:18.557
KNEW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.392
- YOU STILL GOT THAT TAPE?

39:20.426 --> 39:23.429
- IT WAS UPLOADED TO A
PASSWORD-PROTECTED PRIVATE SITE.

39:23.462 --> 39:26.398
- IT'S ALREADY HAD
A COUPLE HUNDRED VIEWINGS.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.534
- SO HALF THE SCHOOL
KNEW ABOUT THIS,

39:28.567 --> 39:30.769
AND NO ONE CAME FORWARD?

39:30.802 --> 39:33.739
[Wild Yaks's
Crazy But Not Afraid]

39:33.772 --> 39:38.577

39:38.610 --> 39:40.479
- EXCUSE ME.

39:42.113 --> 39:45.751
- YOLO!
- YEAH, BOY!

39:45.784 --> 39:47.453
- HEY!

39:47.486 --> 39:50.622
[crowd cheers]
PLEASE! PLEASE HELP ME!

39:50.656 --> 39:52.424
[video stops]
- WELL...

39:52.458 --> 39:56.462
IT'S A LITTLE
LATE IN THE DAY, COUNSELOR.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.996
YOU SANDBAGGED ME.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.665
- WE HAVE YOU TO THANK.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.433
IF YOU HADN'T
BADGERED OUR WITNESS,

40:01.467 --> 40:05.571
WE NEVER WOULD'VE HEARD
ABOUT THIS MYSTERY MAN.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.507
OH, AND HERE.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.476
NICE READ.

40:16.214 --> 40:18.650
- COUNSELOR,
DO YOUR CLIENTS UNDERSTAND

40:18.684 --> 40:21.052
THEY ARE WAIVING
THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL,

40:21.086 --> 40:23.121
A TRIAL AT WHICH THE BURDEN
OF PROOF WOULD BE ON THE PEOPLE?

40:23.154 --> 40:25.957
- THEY DO, YOUR HONOR.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.459
- VERY WELL.

40:27.493 --> 40:30.228
ALEC PETERS, JAKE SWENDERS,
BRIT YARDLEY,

40:30.261 --> 40:33.064
ON THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT
AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT,

40:33.098 --> 40:34.500
HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

40:34.533 --> 40:37.168
- GUILTY.

40:37.202 --> 40:40.572
- GUILTY.
- GUILTY.

40:40.606 --> 40:43.675
- SUSPECTS WILL BE REMANDED
TO RIKERS PENDING SENTENCING.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.511
[bangs gavel]

40:45.544 --> 40:48.780
- [sobbing]

40:53.785 --> 40:56.254
- I THOUGHT
THEY WERE MY FRIENDS.

40:56.287 --> 40:59.224
I TRUSTED THEM.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.226
- WELL, IF IT MAKES
A DIFFERENCE,

41:01.259 --> 41:03.228
A MAN WHO DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW YOU

41:03.261 --> 41:06.464
WENT THROUGH
A LOT OF TROUBLE TO HELP YOU.

41:12.638 --> 41:15.941
- HEY, NICK.
NICK, HOLD UP.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.709
HEY, FRANK CAME THROUGH.

41:17.743 --> 41:19.277
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT HIM
FROM THE GET,

41:19.310 --> 41:22.514
AND I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

41:22.548 --> 41:25.283
- NO.
NO, YOU DON'T.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.886
THE ONLY REASON
I CAUGHT IT--

41:27.919 --> 41:29.688
MARIA.

41:29.721 --> 41:33.692
IN HINDSIGHT,
WHEN SHE CAME HOME FROM IRAQ,

41:33.725 --> 41:35.694
SHE WAS TEXTBOOK PTSD,

41:35.727 --> 41:37.295
AND I DIDN'T SEE IT.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.699
I TOOK IT PERSONALLY.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.668
[sighs]

41:42.701 --> 41:45.203
THINK IT COST ME
MY MARRIAGE.

41:48.073 --> 41:50.542
- HAVE YOU TOLD HER THAT?

41:50.576 --> 41:51.943
- WELL, IT'S A LITTLE LATE.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.312
I DON'T THINK
SHE WANTS TO HEAR IT.

41:54.345 --> 41:57.983
- MAYBE THE FIRST STEP
IS STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.587
- YEAH.
