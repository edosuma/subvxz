SHARK LAKE

01:42.224 --> 01:44.531
Marin county, sheriff department!

02:02.172 --> 02:05.585
Holy shit.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.151
Are you okay?

02:29.861 --> 02:31.389
Shit!

02:59.940 --> 03:02.283
Delivery time, are you ready?

03:03.067 --> 03:07.338
Give me 20 minutes
to say goodnight to some friends.

03:31.158 --> 03:33.947
- Jeez, man.
- Sorry.

03:33.972 --> 03:37.872
- Don't make a mistake.
- He's not making a mistake,

04:02.872 --> 04:05.050
Maybe we should call for backup.

04:05.075 --> 04:07.281
I'm pretty busy right now,
but you go right ahead.

04:07.306 --> 04:10.240
This is... sheriff's deputy Galloway.

04:10.265 --> 04:12.565
We're in high speed
pursuit of a white...

04:12.590 --> 04:13.904
Ah!

04:13.935 --> 04:17.992
40 caravan van,
on Pine road.

04:56.260 --> 04:59.120
Freeze!
Down on your knees!

05:01.649 --> 05:03.864
Down on your knee!

05:10.849 --> 05:13.115
You're under arrest.

05:14.061 --> 05:16.553
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:34.047 --> 05:35.837
Where's her mom?

05:36.079 --> 05:38.559
Died a year and a half ago.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.412
So, who's coming to get her?

05:41.575 --> 05:45.187
Grandma? Aunt?
Neighbour?

05:45.212 --> 05:48.973
Child care services will get here
when they get here.

06:08.592 --> 06:12.141
Five Years Later

06:22.002 --> 06:23.522
I'm sorry, sweetie.

06:23.547 --> 06:24.971
In order to get the
deep end bracelet,

06:24.996 --> 06:27.339
you got to make it
to the other end.

06:32.484 --> 06:34.616
Hey.
Where are you going?

06:34.641 --> 06:37.068
Home.
Swimming is stupid.

06:37.093 --> 06:38.477
Hmm.

06:39.323 --> 06:41.183
That's not what you said
on the way over here.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.181
I change my mind.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.259
Hmm.

06:44.284 --> 06:47.785
You swam across the shallow end
without touching the bottom, right?

06:50.746 --> 06:52.974
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, guys. Come on.

06:52.999 --> 06:55.520
Oh.
I see.

06:55.551 --> 06:59.122
Those guys can pass the
deep end test but you can't.

06:59.147 --> 07:00.448
Mom.

07:00.473 --> 07:02.747
I think you should
get back in the water.

07:02.772 --> 07:04.994
I don't want to.

07:05.272 --> 07:08.526
Carly. There is 2 types
of girls in this world.

07:08.551 --> 07:10.443
Girls who say "I can't"

07:10.468 --> 07:12.558
and girls who say
"Watch this."

07:12.583 --> 07:14.529
Which one are you?

08:10.697 --> 08:15.246
This is DCFS, (Department of Children & Family Services)
we would like to set up some time for...

08:16.590 --> 08:19.649
Do you have any idea how stupid
the state of Nevada is?

08:19.674 --> 08:22.358
I have a feeling
you're about to tell me.

08:27.713 --> 08:29.972
Clint Gray is a problem?

08:30.281 --> 08:34.437
Child services is trying to arrange
a supervise visit with him and Carly.

08:34.462 --> 08:36.571
- Hernandez.
- This is how it starts, Lewis.

08:36.596 --> 08:38.424
- Look, hang on a second.
- No, no. It's not happening.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.575
You need to get Judge Grimes
on the line now.

08:40.601 --> 08:43.138
That's not how it works.

08:46.591 --> 08:49.323
2005.
Assault and battery.

08:49.348 --> 08:53.542
2009.
Assault and battery of a police officer.

08:53.567 --> 08:57.640
2005 to 2010.
Trafficking of illegal animals

08:57.665 --> 08:59.660
through his house,
which include:

08:59.685 --> 09:02.580
Burmese pythons,
wolves,

09:02.605 --> 09:05.216
a god damn tiger.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.684
You ever heard of a
sports team named

09:07.709 --> 09:11.323
the Brooklyn Bunnies or the
Pennsylvania Puppy Dogs?

09:11.348 --> 09:14.518
A lot of people like wild,
vicious animals, Meredith.

09:14.543 --> 09:16.220
You just sold people
what they wanted to buy,

09:16.245 --> 09:17.994
it's no different than dealing.

09:18.019 --> 09:20.729
He had them in the house
with Carly.

09:20.754 --> 09:23.427
And he served his time
and now he's out

09:23.452 --> 09:25.161
and he's still her dad.

09:25.186 --> 09:27.153
I'm not letting him near her.

09:27.178 --> 09:29.798
That's not up to you.

09:30.423 --> 09:31.920
Look.

09:32.081 --> 09:34.230
It could be 6 weeks,
it could be 6 months,

09:34.255 --> 09:36.340
but it's gonna happen.

09:36.365 --> 09:39.050
You should be more concern
with enforcing the law

09:39.075 --> 09:41.890
rather than ignoring the parts
that you don't like.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.089
It's my job to keep her safe.

09:47.274 --> 09:49.457
Just make the call.

09:49.904 --> 09:51.444
Please.

09:54.213 --> 09:57.756
Alright.
I don't think it'll help, but...

09:57.781 --> 09:59.918
I'll see what I can do.

10:00.437 --> 10:02.050
Thank you.

11:34.975 --> 11:36.485
CAUTION:
BEARS ARE ACTIVE
IN THIS AREA

11:36.510 --> 11:39.097
Christopher, did you see
the bears are active sign?

11:39.122 --> 11:40.160
Yep.

11:40.185 --> 11:42.831
Do you think that
the bears are active?

11:42.856 --> 11:44.255
Nope.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.324
Do we have to do this
without people around here.

11:47.349 --> 11:49.237
What about the bears?

11:49.262 --> 11:51.188
Come on.

12:02.119 --> 12:05.023
Christopher.
I forgot my iPad.

12:05.048 --> 12:08.963
I need to take some pictures of
the lake and send them to Lois Itzler.

12:08.988 --> 12:11.657
She said she heard
it's not that nice.

12:11.682 --> 12:14.475
Yeah.
Well, she's an idiot.

12:14.739 --> 12:16.058
I think she's just jealous

12:16.083 --> 12:19.631
'cause Bernie took her to the
Lobster Lounge for the 40th.

12:20.204 --> 12:23.913
She's just gonna die when
she sees how clear it is.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.261
I wish.

12:26.286 --> 12:27.631
What did you say?

12:27.656 --> 12:31.200
Oh. I said I'll be right here
when you get back, darling.

12:31.225 --> 12:32.680
Okay.

13:00.582 --> 13:02.505
Christopher?

13:10.650 --> 13:12.817
Holy moly.

13:31.684 --> 13:34.011
Awwww!

13:52.459 --> 13:54.397
Christopher!

13:56.296 --> 13:58.559
Noooo!

14:07.576 --> 14:10.211
Noooooo...

14:29.465 --> 14:30.910
So.

14:30.941 --> 14:35.273
A 49er tries to escape into the lake
but the bear was faster?

14:35.298 --> 14:38.312
It catches him a few feet into
the water and proceeds to

14:38.337 --> 14:40.577
rip the poor guy apart.

14:40.602 --> 14:42.936
And the wife saw all this?

14:43.815 --> 14:47.642
She was coming down from the car,
she's not exactly ooo sane Bo.

14:47.667 --> 14:50.174
She heard the attack but she
fell down and hit her head,

14:50.199 --> 14:51.892
by the time she got here,

14:51.917 --> 14:54.727
Yogi was already
done with lunch.

14:54.752 --> 14:56.383
What kind of bear?

14:56.408 --> 14:58.213
A big one.

14:58.388 --> 15:00.399
You sure it's a bear?

15:00.431 --> 15:01.791
Won the deal.

15:01.816 --> 15:03.175
Are there tracks?

15:03.200 --> 15:05.793
- In the water?
- On the beach?

15:06.765 --> 15:08.841
I don't know.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.176
Well, she's gorilla's not bear's.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.194
Would you stop?

15:13.219 --> 15:15.075
I just don't get it.

15:15.403 --> 15:17.232
Here we go.

15:17.257 --> 15:20.288
So, a bear went into the lake
and killed somebody.

15:20.313 --> 15:21.605
Bear eat fish.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.688
Our bear went in there 
to get dinner

15:23.733 --> 15:26.575
and this poor asshole 
got in it's way.

15:26.737 --> 15:29.497
Look.
Don't overcomplicate this.

15:29.607 --> 15:31.279
Park rangers are on their way.

15:31.304 --> 15:34.246
We'll send them some our young guys
to help out with the hunt.

15:34.271 --> 15:37.263
They'll kill this thing and then
we can go back to...

15:37.301 --> 15:39.630
breaking up house parties.

15:39.655 --> 15:42.222
We still have to
rule out homicide.

15:42.247 --> 15:44.114
You're kidding me, right?

15:44.139 --> 15:46.986
No person is capable of this.

15:47.628 --> 15:49.839
You sure about that?

16:46.593 --> 16:49.114
Perfect.
I'm starving.

16:50.556 --> 16:53.450
At least you could tell us
what's on the menu.

16:55.033 --> 16:59.521
Larson. You got 30 second
to get out of my house.

16:59.546 --> 17:01.637
Don needs to see you.

17:02.459 --> 17:04.252
Time to get back to work, buddy.

17:04.277 --> 17:05.723
I don't work for him anymore.

17:05.748 --> 17:09.727
Well, he doesn't agree and not all
opinions are created equal.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.166
Look.
Here what we're going to do.

17:16.199 --> 17:19.048
You gonna go for a little ride.
See Don,

17:19.073 --> 17:21.909
and you two can
figure out the details.

17:24.845 --> 17:27.011
30 seconds are up.

17:27.892 --> 17:29.332
Make this easy.

17:29.364 --> 17:31.918
We don't like to
hurt old timers.

17:36.983 --> 17:39.026
Eah!
Aww!

17:47.656 --> 17:49.628
You are not going to shoot me.

17:56.017 --> 17:57.725
We both know

17:57.750 --> 17:59.861
that I will shoot you.

18:07.274 --> 18:08.929
Come on, get up.

18:16.717 --> 18:19.210
Come on, big boy.
Let's get out of here.

18:56.514 --> 18:57.760
Who's turn is it?

18:57.784 --> 18:59.894
My.
I got a good one.

18:59.919 --> 19:02.412
Okay...
Is it a girl?

19:02.437 --> 19:03.750
No.

19:04.256 --> 19:06.681
Okay.
Is it Lachlan.

19:06.706 --> 19:07.806
No.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.205
- Is he in 2nd grade?
- Nope.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.183
Is he in 3rd grade?

19:11.350 --> 19:12.431
Nope.

19:12.456 --> 19:15.046
You don't know any
4th grade boys, do you?

19:15.071 --> 19:17.373
Mom.
No.

19:17.761 --> 19:18.790
Hmm.

19:18.815 --> 19:20.674
Is it Grandma's famous Damin.

19:20.699 --> 19:24.413
Eww. No.
Mom, it's an easy one.

19:28.851 --> 19:30.230
Is it your dad?

19:30.255 --> 19:32.322
What?
No.

19:33.442 --> 19:35.294
It's Lewis.
Jeez.

19:35.319 --> 19:37.626
Oh.
Right.

19:37.651 --> 19:40.366
I told you,
easy one.

19:46.584 --> 19:48.823
- Just the 2 of you?
- Yes.

19:48.848 --> 19:50.631
Follow me.

19:53.312 --> 19:55.095
Thank you.

19:55.317 --> 19:58.061
Are they the ones
looking for the bear?

19:58.086 --> 20:00.070
No.
Who told you that?

20:00.095 --> 20:03.541
Patrick.
He said it was 22 feet tall.

20:03.566 --> 20:05.995
Well, it's not. Do you know
what you want to eat?

20:06.020 --> 20:08.222
Do you think it's still
eating that guy, like...

20:08.247 --> 20:10.718
how mu-how much of him
do you think is left?

20:10.743 --> 20:12.593
Carly.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.625
- There was a bear attack today?
- Yep.

20:15.650 --> 20:17.151
Unconfirm.

20:17.176 --> 20:20.567
Patrick said some bears only
like the taste of humans

20:20.592 --> 20:23.880
and that it's stalking
it's next victim, right now.

20:23.905 --> 20:27.322
Well.
Patrick, is being highly creative.

20:27.347 --> 20:30.085
Patrick also said that a policeman
would kill the bear.

20:30.110 --> 20:31.733
And I thought it would be you

20:31.758 --> 20:34.346
but he said it had 
to be a police man...

20:34.371 --> 20:37.592
Well. Patrick is sexist.
Now, go wash your hands.

20:37.617 --> 20:41.211
- Mom, he's 9.
- He's still sexist.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.029
You're a cop?

20:49.156 --> 20:51.493
You're not a PhD at a bar?

20:53.091 --> 20:55.559
- Can I ask you about the bear attack?
- I can't talk about it.

20:55.584 --> 20:57.582
Oh, of course.
Yeah.

20:57.658 --> 21:01.034
It's just that statistically,
a bear attack is very unlikely.

21:01.059 --> 21:02.729
Contrary to what Patrick might think.

21:02.754 --> 21:07.248
I mean there've only been 27 bear
fatalities in north America since 2000.

21:07.286 --> 21:10.505
Meanwhile 32 people were killed
by dogs last year alone.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.732
How do you know all of this?

21:11.757 --> 21:13.371
I actually do have a PhD

21:13.396 --> 21:14.689
In bears?

21:15.352 --> 21:16.657
No.

21:16.682 --> 21:19.390
I teach oceanography at the
University of Rhode Island.

21:19.415 --> 21:22.531
So, what are you doing
in a bar in Alpine lake.

21:22.556 --> 21:24.562
I'm here for the drought test.

21:25.741 --> 21:27.147
I'm here writing a paper.

21:27.172 --> 21:28.782
It's not as exciting as it sounds.

21:28.807 --> 21:31.347
It doesn't sound exciting at all.

21:32.432 --> 21:35.319
As for this super 
impressive bear stats.

21:35.344 --> 21:37.313
It's not the PhD.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.901
It's the internet.
And according to this,

21:39.926 --> 21:42.672
a bear attack is not impossible.

21:42.870 --> 21:44.266
I just wouldn't bet on it.

21:44.291 --> 21:47.661
So, I should interrogate all the
neighbourhood dogs instead.

21:47.827 --> 21:50.021
Stats would support that.

21:51.231 --> 21:53.177
Hey, good luck.

21:58.672 --> 22:01.809
Oh, you little hooligan.

22:03.702 --> 22:05.818
Shhh.
Carly's asleep.

22:05.843 --> 22:09.509
This dog is going to be
the death of me.

22:18.315 --> 22:19.886
Oh.

22:21.477 --> 22:24.508
Should we be worried
about this bear?

22:26.319 --> 22:28.294
It's not a bear.

22:29.618 --> 22:33.007
Has Carly mentioned anything
to you about her dad recently?

22:33.032 --> 22:36.482
- I'd tell you if she did.
- So, she hasn't?

22:39.435 --> 22:42.284
- Lewis.
- I know.

22:42.324 --> 22:47.192
He's going to see her
sooner or later.

22:47.457 --> 22:49.054
Later.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.534
I have a great idea.

23:39.559 --> 23:43.535
Let's make a fire,
and then...

23:52.596 --> 23:55.023
- Aw!
- Are you okay?

23:55.048 --> 23:56.863
Should we go back?

23:58.227 --> 24:01.844
I'm so sorry that
I distracted you.

24:02.462 --> 24:06.653
Let me see how
I can make it up,

24:10.190 --> 24:12.490
while we're in the water.

24:35.882 --> 24:38.133
- What was that?
- What was what?

24:38.158 --> 24:40.438
- I just felt something, I don't know.
- I did too.

24:40.463 --> 24:42.424
No.
I'm serious.

24:45.926 --> 24:47.658
Dude. Anthony, if you're
messing with me right now,

24:47.683 --> 24:48.996
I'm going to kick your ass.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.873
Hey. It's okay if you're not
ready, we could just wait.

24:51.898 --> 24:52.627
It's...

24:52.652 --> 24:54.384
Awww!

27:19.631 --> 27:21.392
When I'm the one 
that gets the bear.

27:21.430 --> 27:23.848
Lindsey Staley's gonna take me back.

27:24.197 --> 27:26.307
Especially when she reads
about me in the newspaper.

27:26.332 --> 27:27.606
Lindsey can't read.

27:27.631 --> 27:29.847
I'll be on the news too.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.999
Think they will let me mount
the bear head on the wall?

27:33.024 --> 27:35.177
Dude, use your tranquilizer guns.

27:35.202 --> 27:37.611
All I'm saying is...

27:59.749 --> 28:02.991
I talked to the dogs,
it was a bear after all.

28:03.016 --> 28:04.652
You were wrong.

28:05.753 --> 28:07.387
No, I'm not.

28:08.738 --> 28:11.298
Your killer's definitely not a bear.

28:56.642 --> 28:59.397
This is been a terrible tragedy
for the victims

28:59.422 --> 29:02.394
and our thoughts and prayers
are with the families.

29:02.419 --> 29:04.676
Jesus, he's not picking up.

29:05.142 --> 29:07.578
Pick up your phone, Lewis.

29:13.896 --> 29:16.245
I do want to comment
the department of...

29:16.270 --> 29:21.409
Conservation and Natural Resources
for their quick apprehension of a black bear.

29:21.434 --> 29:24.926
It is a male, 
approximately 500 pounds.

29:26.203 --> 29:28.557
And now the people of Nevada,

29:28.582 --> 29:30.926
don't have to worry anymore
about being harm.

29:30.951 --> 29:33.024
- How big was the bear?
- Uh. 500 pounds, black...

29:33.049 --> 29:36.296
Everybody, get out of the water!

29:36.321 --> 29:37.948
We got him,
it's under control.

29:37.973 --> 29:39.684
No, it's not!

29:39.709 --> 29:41.093
Get them out!
NOW!

29:41.118 --> 29:42.085
Hernandez.

29:42.110 --> 29:43.762
Get them out!

29:49.119 --> 29:51.366
Oh, shit.

30:03.887 --> 30:06.053
Tell him what you told me.

30:06.952 --> 30:08.712
Okay.
Well, see.

30:08.737 --> 30:12.061
Most sharks, if you drop them in a lake
they will absorb too much fresh water

30:12.092 --> 30:13.892
relative to their body solvents

30:13.917 --> 30:16.604
basically causing them to drown
from the inside out

30:16.629 --> 30:20.621
But, bull sharks...
bull sharks are very special.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.310
They're unique and they have the
ability to regulate their kidneys

30:23.338 --> 30:25.395
to suit the salinity
of the water they're in.

30:25.420 --> 30:29.595
Some of the variable osmoregulation is only 
seen in a very small percentage of sharks.

30:29.620 --> 30:30.969
It's not possible.

30:30.994 --> 30:33.515
Who's ever heard of
a shark in a lake.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.477
The bulls have been known to swim
way up the Mississippi river.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.362
They have been spotted
in Lake Michigan and

30:38.393 --> 30:41.208
there's a whole bunch of them
swimming happily in Lake Nicaragua.

30:41.233 --> 30:44.782
Well, how long can it last
in there without having

30:44.807 --> 30:47.972
salt fos...osmor... what
would you call it, kills it.

30:47.997 --> 30:51.753
Bull sharks won't expire
due to the lack of salinity.

30:51.778 --> 30:53.044
In English.

30:53.070 --> 30:56.025
It will live
and thrive.

30:56.050 --> 30:58.288
Until somebody removes it
or kills it.

30:58.313 --> 31:01.069
We don't have a river
that connects the Pacific.

31:01.094 --> 31:02.621
So, professor.

31:02.646 --> 31:05.539
How did it
get into my lake?

31:05.564 --> 31:08.697
That's a good question.
If I had to guess, I'll say...

31:08.722 --> 31:10.460
Somebody put it there.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.813
Are you ready for
your big swim meet.

31:15.972 --> 31:17.370
Don't be nervous.

31:17.395 --> 31:20.110
You should go, right now!

31:25.537 --> 31:27.123
Sorry.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.591
Just...

31:30.616 --> 31:32.824
Just tell her that I...

31:32.849 --> 31:35.943
Just tell her that I stop by
to talk to her, alright?

31:35.968 --> 31:37.912
I'll tell her.

32:01.367 --> 32:03.706
Sheriff, can you confirm
that it's a shark?

32:03.731 --> 32:06.700
As I'm sure you all know
by now, there was another,

32:06.725 --> 32:09.172
accident on the lake this morning.

32:10.310 --> 32:13.571
Mom:
Clint came by the house
today to see Carly...

32:25.043 --> 32:27.051
We don't have a ton
to go by just yet,

32:27.076 --> 32:30.779
but we're taking
every precaution here.

32:30.804 --> 32:33.508
We're temporary closing the beaches

32:33.533 --> 32:36.716
and... we're asking everyone
to stay out of the water

32:36.741 --> 32:39.469
until we can confirm 
that it is safe.

32:40.942 --> 32:43.529
The headline here is that,
we're on it.

32:43.554 --> 32:46.484
And soon everything
will be back to normal.

32:47.224 --> 32:48.803
Trust me.

32:54.379 --> 32:57.396
I love you,
and I'll always protect you.

32:57.421 --> 33:00.033
- You know that, right?
- Um-hmm.

33:00.860 --> 33:03.222
It's not that he's...

33:04.957 --> 33:07.504
Look, I just have to say this.
I'm not trying to scare you,

33:07.528 --> 33:09.347
but if he comes up
to you somewhere,

33:09.372 --> 33:11.631
and he's not going to,
but if he does,

33:11.656 --> 33:14.633
you just have to go 
find an adult.

33:14.859 --> 33:18.892
Grandma, me or your teacher.
Right away.

33:18.917 --> 33:20.391
Does that make sense?

33:20.416 --> 33:21.781
But...

33:22.329 --> 33:25.107
He...
He's not bad, right?

33:25.132 --> 33:27.066
My dad.

33:29.393 --> 33:31.804
He's made some mistakes.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.118
But, no, honey.
He's not bad.

33:50.439 --> 33:52.282
Morning, Clint.

33:57.383 --> 34:00.134
Don.
Could you not eat on my couch?

34:00.159 --> 34:02.435
I'll send my maid over.

34:11.509 --> 34:14.181
You know lately,
my wife's been on...

34:14.206 --> 34:16.163
this vegan kit.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.942
I better get my meat
where I can.

34:18.967 --> 34:21.349
So, how've you been, Clint?

34:23.351 --> 34:24.862
Fine.

34:25.110 --> 34:27.246
Well, good for you.

34:27.513 --> 34:30.790
I wish I could say
the same about myself.

34:30.815 --> 34:32.856
I've been stressed.

34:39.668 --> 34:43.166
Have you been...
following the news?

34:47.741 --> 34:48.960
Not particularly.

34:48.985 --> 34:52.495
Well. Apparently, there's
something in the lake.

34:52.663 --> 34:54.489
And guess what.

34:54.514 --> 34:56.228
It's mine.

35:00.123 --> 35:01.648
I'm not interested.

35:01.677 --> 35:05.549
Well. It's not a matter of
your interest level, Clint.

35:05.574 --> 35:07.864
And we had a deal

35:07.889 --> 35:11.216
And you're about
5 years late on your end.

35:14.695 --> 35:17.424
No, Don.
I paid for it.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.693
And I feel for you.

35:20.145 --> 35:23.810
But when I buy something,
I expect to get it.

35:24.091 --> 35:28.594
And if I start letting things slide
and calling it even,

35:28.716 --> 35:32.548
well, this puts me in a
very precarious position.

35:32.573 --> 35:34.731
So I'll tell you 
what I'm going to do.

35:35.722 --> 35:39.021
I am going to come
back here tomorrow.

35:39.404 --> 35:43.851
And you are going to give me
1 of 2 things.

35:43.876 --> 35:47.509
My money,
or my shark.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.188
Clint.

35:50.287 --> 35:54.956
You're my only friend who's really
good at finding these animals.

35:54.981 --> 36:00.094
I mean, most of my other friends,
they're just good at finding... people.

36:06.471 --> 36:08.041
She's cute.

36:08.066 --> 36:09.844
You touch her.

36:10.232 --> 36:12.584
And I kill everyone you know.

36:14.457 --> 36:17.213
Sh-She's very sweet.

36:18.385 --> 36:22.023
Go fish,
I give this back to you.

36:25.894 --> 36:28.732
I'll even let you use my boat.

36:35.871 --> 36:37.633
You have a day.

36:41.442 --> 36:42.816
Oh.

36:43.071 --> 36:45.988
Just remember to wash it
when you're done.

37:00.381 --> 37:01.985
The shark.

37:04.953 --> 37:08.021
- I need that restraining order, today.
- Not now, Hernandez.

37:08.046 --> 37:11.833
I also don't believe the shark will
respond to a restraining order.

37:11.858 --> 37:15.526
But don't worry, lovely.
It'll respond to me.

37:16.216 --> 37:18.045
Garreth Ross.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.083
Good for you.

37:19.108 --> 37:21.804
Host of "Fish fried",
on the BBC.

37:21.829 --> 37:23.525
Never heard of it.

37:23.949 --> 37:26.487
I catch these monsters
for a living, hon.

37:26.512 --> 37:30.175
And I'll catch yours for the great
low price for allowing me to film it.

37:30.200 --> 37:33.173
We'll cut in some interviews
with concerned citizens

37:33.198 --> 37:36.224
We add a little dirt dirt dirt,
and catch the bastard,

37:36.249 --> 37:38.801
be out of your knickers 
by nightfall.

37:38.899 --> 37:42.454
Unless of course,
you have other ideas.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.840
I'll leave you to it.

37:53.741 --> 37:57.286
Tell that guy to take his camera
and shove it up his arrogant ass.

37:57.311 --> 38:00.734
People died here, we're not making
a reality TV show out of this.

38:00.759 --> 38:03.090
Look, he's done it before.

38:03.229 --> 38:04.247
Lewis.

38:04.272 --> 38:07.689
You know for some reason, everybody
else around here calls me Sheriff.

38:07.718 --> 38:08.961
What's your point?

38:08.986 --> 38:11.776
Look. You want to know the reason
why we let this guy catch the shark

38:11.801 --> 38:15.154
because he knows how to catch
the shark. He's done it before.

38:15.179 --> 38:16.890
It's that, that ass clown doesn't care.

38:16.915 --> 38:18.750
Stop. You're done
lifeguarding now, okay.

38:18.775 --> 38:20.774
It's out of your hands.

38:23.636 --> 38:25.906
What about Clint Gray?

38:26.720 --> 38:28.654
Seriously?
We're bringing that up, now?

38:28.679 --> 38:29.729
It can't wait.

38:29.754 --> 38:32.217
Have you noticed we're
in the middle of a shit storm.

38:32.242 --> 38:33.423
He came over to my house.

38:33.448 --> 38:34.564
- I don't care.
- Lewis.

38:34.589 --> 38:36.305
We're done.

38:37.153 --> 38:39.601
This make extraordinary...

38:39.630 --> 38:42.664
Celebratory cocktail this evening, officer?

38:45.097 --> 38:47.402
I'll take that as a maybe.

42:05.985 --> 42:08.607
Oh, wait.
I shouldn't smile, should I?

42:08.632 --> 42:10.467
Or should I?

42:10.825 --> 42:13.298
Just be emotionally honest, darling.

42:13.323 --> 42:17.267
How did the events in the past
24 hours make you feel?

42:17.327 --> 42:19.702
Well, scared, I guess.
I mean...

42:19.727 --> 42:21.478
I'm just here for
a bachelorette party.

42:21.503 --> 42:24.493
I wasn't even planning going
swimming, I lay out.

42:24.518 --> 42:26.605
Lakes gross me out.
You know?

42:26.630 --> 42:29.910
Oh, absolutely.
Disgusting things, lakes.

42:29.935 --> 42:31.416
Totally.

42:31.441 --> 42:34.235
I love your accent by the way

42:34.260 --> 42:36.571
It's my money maker.

42:37.345 --> 42:38.835
Tell you what.

42:38.860 --> 42:40.803
Why don't you tell the camera,

42:40.827 --> 42:44.065
that you don't feel safe
in your own backyard anymore,

42:44.090 --> 42:49.105
that you're terribly frightened
but confident at the same time

42:49.130 --> 42:52.975
that you feel safe again
now that I'm here.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.103
In your own words, of course.

42:55.128 --> 42:57.952
Then you can,
give me your phone number

42:57.977 --> 43:00.351
and I'll meet up with you
in your bachelorette party

43:00.376 --> 43:02.605
as soon as I'm done fishing.

43:04.657 --> 43:06.161
Roll it.

43:07.658 --> 43:10.760
I'm like, super scared of the shark.
But...

43:10.785 --> 43:13.999
so, so happy that you're
here to save everyone.

43:14.024 --> 43:18.010
I feel like,
I can finally breathe again.

43:18.828 --> 43:22.675
I'm not going to lie to you,
we're dealing with a monster here.

43:22.699 --> 43:28.606
Nature's serial killer,
I can only promise to do my best.

43:31.064 --> 43:33.515
I'm Garreth Ross.

43:36.281 --> 43:39.152
Listen, I don't pretend to
know how television works,

43:39.177 --> 43:41.367
and while it's really interesting
watching you stare

43:41.392 --> 43:43.921
at yourself, like my 15 year old
daughter, in the mirror,

43:43.946 --> 43:47.714
We need to catch the shark
and we need to do it now.

43:48.209 --> 43:49.998
By all means.

43:50.879 --> 43:52.572
Shall we?

44:08.963 --> 44:13.786
First rule of shark fishing
is a reek chaff flake.

44:21.478 --> 44:25.863
Shark smells that,
he thinks it's dinner time.

44:25.993 --> 44:27.659
He would be wrong.

44:27.684 --> 44:30.692
And... cut.

44:30.865 --> 44:32.167
Good?

44:33.913 --> 44:35.950
Won't be long now.

44:43.413 --> 44:47.717
Soviet APS underwater assault rifle

44:51.790 --> 44:54.044
What the hell are you
doing with this thing.

45:03.172 --> 45:07.176
How long can a shark survive in that lake
without anybody knowing about it.

45:07.201 --> 45:08.890
Good morning, officer.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.209
You're sleeping in the
middle of the day?

45:11.745 --> 45:14.568
Yeah. I was up all night
researching bull sharks.

45:14.593 --> 45:16.061
So, how long?

45:16.086 --> 45:18.119
I don't-I don't know.

45:18.980 --> 45:23.201
There's plenty of food, no predators,
and it's a big lake.

45:23.226 --> 45:24.988
5 years?

45:25.917 --> 45:29.857
I don't-I don't know.
It's possible, I guess.

45:29.948 --> 45:32.884
- It's a bull shark, right?
- Hang on.

45:36.765 --> 45:41.381
I think, 5 years ago, Clint Gray
put this shark in the lake.

45:41.406 --> 45:43.929
And now I think
he's trying to kill it.

45:48.723 --> 45:50.367
What's wrong?

45:59.724 --> 46:01.083
You're going to 
kill it with that?

46:01.108 --> 46:04.420
No. I'm going to
dance with it first.

46:04.445 --> 46:06.946
You've to give the people
what they want.

46:07.688 --> 46:09.636
Then I'm going to get
back in the boat,

46:09.661 --> 46:12.515
and catch it like a
proper fisherman I am.

46:18.140 --> 46:19.558
There!

46:22.955 --> 46:25.355
Must be about an 8 footer.

46:25.466 --> 46:27.729
Relatively docile.

46:27.754 --> 46:30.366
Roll it.
Shoot the hypersphere.

46:32.085 --> 46:34.732
Our shark is in the water.

46:34.757 --> 46:38.736
Circling the boat very quickly,
erratically.

46:38.761 --> 46:42.316
From what I can tell, we're dealing
with a very aggressive animal here.

46:42.341 --> 46:45.143
At least a 13 footer.

46:45.381 --> 46:49.088
I'm about to come face to face
with a ruthless killer.

46:49.521 --> 46:51.324
Wish me luck.

46:52.867 --> 46:54.351
Cut it.

46:54.376 --> 46:55.868
Gear up.

47:02.990 --> 47:04.956
Come on, man.
Chop chop.

48:04.579 --> 48:05.785
Oh!

48:13.062 --> 48:14.559
Oof.

49:01.487 --> 49:03.269
It's a coordinated attack.

49:03.294 --> 49:05.464
Not possible.
Bull sharks hunt alone.

49:05.489 --> 49:07.684
- Watch.
- Turn it off.

49:07.709 --> 49:10.406
I mean occasionally in pairs,
but that's rare.

49:10.431 --> 49:11.686
I'm serious, Hernandez.

49:11.711 --> 49:14.086
First one is acting as bait,
and then before you know it,

49:14.111 --> 49:16.396
the bait becomes a predator,
and it's over.

49:16.421 --> 49:19.140
Turn that god damn thing off!

49:24.330 --> 49:26.544
It really doesn't matter
how they hunt.

49:26.569 --> 49:29.800
Tomorrow,
we're hunting them.

49:29.904 --> 49:32.053
Every fisherman in 3 state

49:32.078 --> 49:34.398
who wants to get paid
is going after them.

49:34.423 --> 49:38.286
I got approval from the mayor,
10k per dead fish.

49:38.673 --> 49:40.078
Peter?

49:41.943 --> 49:44.038
All due respect, sir.

49:44.366 --> 49:46.520
That's not such a good idea.

49:46.545 --> 49:47.871
If you don't have
the right gear,

49:47.896 --> 49:50.288
and more importantly
the right kind of boat,

49:50.313 --> 49:51.960
it will be Thanksgiving
out there.

49:51.985 --> 49:53.312
For the sharks, I mean.

49:53.337 --> 49:54.969
Well, I understand the problem.

49:54.994 --> 49:57.475
We got a big boy out there
and 2 of his friends.

49:57.500 --> 50:00.002
But there's going to be
a whole lot more of us.

50:00.027 --> 50:02.174
It's actually a big girl.

50:02.535 --> 50:05.435
And by the looks of it,
2 of her pubs.

50:05.460 --> 50:06.993
What do you mean?

50:07.404 --> 50:09.901
She was pregnant when
she went into the lake.

50:15.290 --> 50:17.306
Same old shit.

50:18.525 --> 50:20.916
You need a break.

50:21.461 --> 50:23.127
I'm fine.

50:23.921 --> 50:26.762
Do you always look this angry
when you're fine?

50:26.997 --> 50:28.438
Yes.

50:29.139 --> 50:30.223
Come on.

50:30.248 --> 50:32.145
Let me buy you a drink.
It'll be good for you.

50:32.170 --> 50:34.526
How do you know
what's good for me?

50:34.653 --> 50:36.120
I'm a doctor.

50:36.145 --> 50:37.653
Who studies fish.

50:37.678 --> 50:39.496
Still a doctor.

50:40.084 --> 50:41.690
One drink.

50:44.123 --> 50:47.205
Okay, fine.
One drink.

50:47.230 --> 50:49.252
Just let me change.

50:57.747 --> 50:59.639
First day jitters?

50:59.765 --> 51:01.467
This isn't a date.

51:01.492 --> 51:03.037
Really?

51:03.361 --> 51:06.022
'Cause I'm been on
a few dates before,

51:06.047 --> 51:09.262
I mean not a ton
but a respectable amount,

51:09.287 --> 51:11.935
this is usually what they're like.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.109
Do you think they enjoy killing?

51:14.983 --> 51:18.222
I take that back.
This-This isn't what they're like.

51:18.251 --> 51:20.870
I'm sorry, but,
do they?

51:22.277 --> 51:24.376
No more than any other predator.

51:24.401 --> 51:26.500
I mean they like eating,
they don't like starving.

51:26.525 --> 51:28.743
So, you don't think they're evil?

51:29.241 --> 51:30.301
No.

51:30.326 --> 51:33.468
I just-I just think they're
really good at their job.

51:33.643 --> 51:35.201
Their eyes.

51:35.226 --> 51:39.081
The one that killed Garreth,
they were evil.

51:39.106 --> 51:41.208
You can make them villains,
but they're just doing what

51:41.233 --> 51:44.803
millions of years of evolution
has program them to do.

51:44.828 --> 51:46.220
They're surviving.

51:46.245 --> 51:49.159
I can't stop thinking about
those people that died.

51:49.184 --> 51:52.894
All they did was go into a lake
that was suppose to be safe.

51:52.919 --> 51:55.712
- Well, who said it was safe.
- You know what I mean.

51:55.737 --> 51:58.761
Earth is a bad neighbourhood, Meredith.

51:58.786 --> 52:00.719
Aren't that a little dramatic?

52:00.744 --> 52:03.848
You know, I mean. In fact,
people underestimate all the time

52:03.873 --> 52:06.084
 what a bad neighbourhood it is.

52:06.109 --> 52:11.000
Alright. Humans build buildings and bridges
and roads and resorts on lakes.

52:11.025 --> 52:13.908
Okay, we have police departments
and all sorts of other things

52:13.933 --> 52:15.602
to help us pretend
that we are safe.

52:15.627 --> 52:20.370
We put all this layers on top of nature
and then we pretend that it's not nature.

52:20.817 --> 52:24.844
Or maybe it's too scary to think
about what it's really like out there.

52:24.869 --> 52:28.862
- It doesn't have to be like that.
- Yeah, it does.

52:29.611 --> 52:33.898
Because all living things on earth
are doing the same 3 things.

52:33.923 --> 52:36.184
1. They are finding food.

52:36.209 --> 52:39.593
Which it's exactly what that shark was
doing when it went after those people.

52:39.618 --> 52:40.672
And 2.

52:40.697 --> 52:43.041
All animals are programed
to protect their young,

52:43.066 --> 52:45.425
which is what you do
everyday of the week.

52:45.450 --> 52:50.454
So, if every animal is willing to do
whatever it takes to protect their young,

52:52.697 --> 52:54.423
some will live.

52:55.734 --> 52:57.633
And some will die.

53:22.617 --> 53:24.514
Don't wimp out.

53:29.267 --> 53:31.941
Where are you?

53:36.416 --> 53:38.867
14 PINE RD,
LAKE COUNTY, NEVADA

53:38.892 --> 53:41.243
CLINT GRAY

53:52.570 --> 53:54.509
Want to walk the mutt with me?

53:54.549 --> 53:58.095
No, thanks, Grandma.
I've way too much homework.

53:58.120 --> 54:00.434
Well, it's criminal how
they work you kids.

54:00.459 --> 54:02.477
Yeah.
Um... totally.

54:02.502 --> 54:05.924
Okay, honey.
I'll be back in 5.

54:32.259 --> 54:34.022
Heel!

54:35.027 --> 54:38.683
That means nothing to you, I suppose.

54:39.116 --> 54:41.135
What's the 3rd thing?

54:42.104 --> 54:45.085
- What do you mean?
- All living things.

54:45.110 --> 54:48.204
They find food.
Protect their young.

54:48.586 --> 54:50.645
What's the 3rd thing they do?

54:52.547 --> 54:54.461
Are you flirting with me?

54:54.745 --> 54:56.002
Not at all.

54:56.027 --> 54:58.829
Just trying to figure out
what the 3rd thing is.

54:59.677 --> 55:01.654
And do you need my help?

55:02.762 --> 55:03.877
Mmm.

55:03.902 --> 55:05.045
No.

55:05.070 --> 55:07.523
But, I'll let you know
when I figured it out.

55:08.047 --> 55:10.381
Can I have your keys,
I'm driving.

55:15.333 --> 55:17.618
14 Pine Rd.
Alpine Lake.

55:30.176 --> 55:31.486
Hey!

55:31.511 --> 55:34.233
Ohh.
Oliver.

55:34.258 --> 55:36.306
Just stop!

55:46.458 --> 55:48.722
Oliver.

55:54.802 --> 55:57.296
Oliver.

56:23.759 --> 56:25.615
Where're you going?

56:26.386 --> 56:28.116
I'm walking you in.

56:28.141 --> 56:30.503
We're not playing meet the family.

56:31.637 --> 56:34.051
Did I mention I have a PhD?

56:34.606 --> 56:36.999
I mean.
It's plays well with the mothers.

56:37.024 --> 56:39.660
Your daughter and I
both like bears.

56:39.838 --> 56:43.239
And I'll make killer pancakes
for the 4 of us in the morning.

56:44.061 --> 56:45.607
I'm kidding.

56:48.132 --> 56:50.047
Good bye, Peter.

57:13.889 --> 57:15.371
Mom!

58:00.242 --> 58:01.843
You okay.

58:04.985 --> 58:06.894
I got to take the shark
to the morgue and

58:06.919 --> 58:09.644
cut it open and
see what’s inside.

58:09.669 --> 58:12.584
- It was almost my mother.
- Yeah, but it wasn't.

58:12.609 --> 58:14.772
- 2 seconds.
- Meredith.

58:14.797 --> 58:16.289
I know.

58:17.080 --> 58:20.181
I know.
She's completely fine, but...

58:20.473 --> 58:22.221
Clue idiotic.

58:23.860 --> 58:26.072
I nearly lost her, Peter.

58:26.151 --> 58:28.149
It'll be over soon.

58:28.540 --> 58:30.491
You can get back to
human criminals and

58:30.516 --> 58:32.755
I'll go back to fish sex.

58:33.888 --> 58:36.425
She's gone!
She's gone!

58:36.450 --> 58:38.931
She was here
and now she's gone.

58:38.956 --> 58:41.963
- We should see if she's okay.
- It's him.

58:42.357 --> 58:44.066
Come on, give me your key.

58:58.914 --> 59:01.346
Hel...
Hello.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.441
Anybody home?

59:51.116 --> 59:53.794
I need an APB to go out
on a Clint Gray

59:53.819 --> 59:58.629
for the kidnapping of Carly Gray.
Send a unit to 14 Pine road.

01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:18.165
He's not here.

01:01:19.173 --> 01:01:21.854
He's probably half way
to Canada by now.

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:37.617
Scratch that.

01:01:37.948 --> 01:01:39.914
We're going to need 
some backup.

01:02:08.139 --> 01:02:09.726
Freeze!

01:02:12.056 --> 01:02:13.907
Hey.
What's the problem, officer.

01:02:13.932 --> 01:02:17.247
You're under arrest for the
kidnapping of Carly Gray.

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:19.758
She's been kidnapped?

01:02:19.783 --> 01:02:21.713
Now taste the deck!

01:02:22.131 --> 01:02:24.223
You heard me, come on.

01:02:26.158 --> 01:02:27.964
Come on, do it.

01:02:28.146 --> 01:02:30.492
Don't hurt my dad.

01:02:38.249 --> 01:02:40.163
Stay down, Carly.

01:02:57.179 --> 01:02:59.188
How does the deck taste?

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:10.583
We're going to need a boat.

01:03:10.608 --> 01:03:12.091
Come on.

01:03:27.164 --> 01:03:28.844
Carly.

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:32.441
Wow, you're beautiful.

01:03:33.011 --> 01:03:35.121
You got so...

01:03:35.146 --> 01:03:36.428
so big.

01:03:36.453 --> 01:03:40.186
Thanks. My mom says
I'm 8, going on 18.

01:03:40.211 --> 01:03:43.052
Yeah.
Yeah, I can see that.

01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:47.316
Look.
I'm sorry I...

01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:49.385
haven't been around.

01:03:50.264 --> 01:03:52.407
I miss you very much.

01:03:52.837 --> 01:03:55.344
I knew you were nice.

01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:03.390
Hey.

01:04:06.424 --> 01:04:08.159
So, how did you find me, sweetie?

01:04:08.184 --> 01:04:10.631
In Mom's office,
there are papers about you,

01:04:10.656 --> 01:04:14.073
what you did and stuff
and where you live.

01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:15.746
Oh.

01:04:15.771 --> 01:04:17.256
Mom's office, huh.

01:04:17.281 --> 01:04:19.591
Are...
Are you mad at me?

01:04:19.616 --> 01:04:21.276
No.

01:04:21.369 --> 01:04:23.447
Not even a little bit.

01:04:23.647 --> 01:04:26.522
But right now,
we got to get you home.

01:04:26.547 --> 01:04:29.835
Is it 'cause that sheriff was trying
to make you go back to jail.

01:04:29.863 --> 01:04:32.221
No. No. But...
Forget about him.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.196
Then, why do I have to go home?

01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:38.230
Here, put this on.

01:04:38.996 --> 01:04:42.677
It's late. Your mom is all
worried about you and...

01:04:42.702 --> 01:04:45.019
soon we'll get to hang out
all the time.

01:04:45.044 --> 01:04:47.088
Maybe we can go to the 
playground tomorrow.

01:04:47.113 --> 01:04:48.773
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, maybe.

01:04:48.798 --> 01:04:49.971
Do you like tacos?

01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:52.147
'Cause we can get tacos
after the playground.

01:04:52.172 --> 01:04:56.294
- Yeah. I love tacos.
- Me, too

01:04:56.332 --> 01:04:59.343
Hey, get up here.
Alright.

01:04:59.706 --> 01:05:01.291
We're going to go.

01:05:03.826 --> 01:05:05.438
Hang on.

01:05:10.344 --> 01:05:13.953
If we're going home,
isn't it that way?

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.998
Yeah, well.
We're taking the scenic route.

01:05:18.335 --> 01:05:20.519
So, the plan is to
take the boat out,

01:05:20.544 --> 01:05:23.128
scour the lake in the dark
in hope we find Clint

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:26.887
and your daughter before he decides to
tooling around in the middle of the night

01:05:26.912 --> 01:05:30.354
isn't the best way to prove
his parental bonafides.

01:05:30.379 --> 01:05:33.699
Hernandez.
It's right here.

01:05:33.724 --> 01:05:35.463
That's your boat?

01:05:35.527 --> 01:05:37.224
Oh, yeah.

01:05:37.249 --> 01:05:38.916
I don't think it's big enough.

01:05:38.941 --> 01:05:40.980
But, it will do.

01:05:45.469 --> 01:05:46.745
Key?

01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:48.672
Umm.
It's my boat.

01:05:48.697 --> 01:05:50.250
I'm driving.

01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:11.790
There're other sharks out there right?

01:06:11.815 --> 01:06:13.795
Yeah. Which means you need
to get out of the water.

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.357
Oh, I don't think so, chief.

01:06:15.382 --> 01:06:16.814
See I got me a plan.

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:19.135
I'm going to lure them
sons of bitches out there

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.492
with these here deer guts.
Look.

01:06:20.523 --> 01:06:22.410
My buddy, Riley,
shows up with this rig

01:06:22.435 --> 01:06:23.641
I'm going to lure them
right to him.

01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:25.952
BAM! We're going to get us
a ripe fat paycheck.

01:06:25.977 --> 01:06:28.180
Sir, you need to get
the hell out of the water.

01:06:28.205 --> 01:06:31.831
What, and leave the sharks to you?
Don't think so.

01:06:45.779 --> 01:06:48.316
How big is the lake, exactly?

01:06:48.474 --> 01:06:50.543
200 square miles.

01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:53.481
So, we're planning on
finding him next month.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.225
This thing doesn't
have stealth mode.

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:57.716
The faster we go,
the louder we get.

01:07:03.511 --> 01:07:05.842
Why don't we just turn back,
you know, and wait for light?

01:07:05.867 --> 01:07:08.958
Shh. Shh. Shh.
Did-Did you hear that?

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:11.953
Yeah.

01:07:12.188 --> 01:07:14.162
Where is it coming from?

01:07:25.152 --> 01:07:26.879
PETER!

01:07:40.227 --> 01:07:42.228
Throw me a rope!

01:07:54.089 --> 01:07:55.659
Peter!

01:07:56.056 --> 01:07:57.586
Hang on.

01:08:10.224 --> 01:08:11.884
I'm coming.

01:08:15.867 --> 01:08:18.064
Peter, get out of the water!

01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:34.209
Don't look back!
Just swim!

01:08:40.372 --> 01:08:42.359
Awww!

01:09:00.099 --> 01:09:03.075
Aaahhhhh!

01:09:04.299 --> 01:09:05.956
It's my fault.

01:09:05.981 --> 01:09:07.865
Shouldn't have let him
come out here.

01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:09.721
We shouldn't be out here.

01:09:09.747 --> 01:09:12.314
Well, let's go back.
Right now!

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.731
Before anyone else gets hurt.

01:09:14.756 --> 01:09:16.325
I can't do that.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:18.968
- Carly's out here.
- How do you know?

01:09:19.126 --> 01:09:22.495
We have every cop, in Alpine Lake,
out looking for him.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.830
He knows that.

01:09:23.854 --> 01:09:27.279
And if he's smart,
and he is,

01:09:27.305 --> 01:09:29.129
he's going to lay low
out here until morning.

01:09:29.154 --> 01:09:32.465
One of the idiot and
his brother is out fishing sharks.

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:34.127
He knows the chief is going
to turn everyone onto them

01:09:34.152 --> 01:09:37.274
and he'll ditch his boat
and be gone with Carly.

01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:41.500
But he's not gone yet.

01:09:48.368 --> 01:09:50.290
Then we'll keep looking.

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:56.328
Okay.

01:10:04.169 --> 01:10:05.664
Shit.

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:10.506
I'm sorry, Meredith.

01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:12.605
I'll call the station, it will
take them a couple of hours

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:13.752
 but they will find us.

01:10:13.777 --> 01:10:16.911
I don't think
we have a couple of hours.

01:10:20.493 --> 01:10:23.014
Here, take this.

01:10:28.704 --> 01:10:31.272
Come on.
Pick up.

01:10:42.827 --> 01:10:45.492
I don't want to play 
Titanic anymore.

01:10:45.517 --> 01:10:48.856
I don't remember there
being any sharks in Titanic.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.826
Not funny.

01:10:55.639 --> 01:10:58.143
Look, they'll be here soon.

01:10:59.304 --> 01:11:01.747
Yeah.
Well, not soon enough.

01:11:02.464 --> 01:11:04.130
What're you doing?

01:11:04.155 --> 01:11:05.910
I'm making a weapon.

01:11:08.128 --> 01:11:09.499
Sorry.

01:11:10.463 --> 01:11:13.115
Since it's a look like
glock and hold and all.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.518
Maybe it went away.

01:11:35.035 --> 01:11:36.729
You think.

01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:43.377
The scientist

01:11:43.402 --> 01:11:48.694
says that predators don't just vanish from
rich uncontested waters for no reason.

01:11:49.925 --> 01:11:52.473
The human being who
is floating helplessly

01:11:52.498 --> 01:11:56.208
in these waters hopes
the scientist is wrong.

01:12:04.377 --> 01:12:06.357
Well, as long as
this thing is still on,

01:12:06.382 --> 01:12:08.722
they can track us with a GPS.

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:11.381
Even in a lake?

01:12:12.081 --> 01:12:14.267
Technically, yes.

01:12:14.848 --> 01:12:16.988
Have you ever done that before?

01:12:17.026 --> 01:12:18.697
No.

01:12:45.762 --> 01:12:47.364
You okay?

01:12:47.389 --> 01:12:49.196
Yeah.
I'm just cold.

01:12:49.221 --> 01:12:50.774
Oh, here.

01:12:53.055 --> 01:12:55.032
This probably doesn't help.

01:12:55.103 --> 01:12:56.874
It does.

01:12:57.844 --> 01:12:59.207
Meredith.

01:12:59.232 --> 01:13:00.924
I'm sorry.

01:13:00.949 --> 01:13:02.275
What if I never see her again?

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.772
She's-She's so young.
She needs me.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.452
Yeah, she does.

01:13:06.477 --> 01:13:08.758
That's why we're 
getting out of here, okay?

01:13:08.783 --> 01:13:12.242
You need to believe it, alright?
That's what you said, right?

01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:14.843
We're getting out of here.
Say it.

01:13:14.868 --> 01:13:16.998
We're getting out of here.

01:13:18.145 --> 01:13:19.917
Feel better?

01:13:19.942 --> 01:13:21.757
Not really.

01:13:24.343 --> 01:13:28.692
Ah.
See, it's not so bad.

01:13:28.717 --> 01:13:30.136
Right?

01:13:30.856 --> 01:13:32.648
I've been on dates 
worse than this.

01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:34.427
I doubt it.

01:13:36.732 --> 01:13:38.992
This girl in college,

01:13:39.926 --> 01:13:42.916
she wanted to have 
some fun with handcuffs.

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:45.393
We try the key,

01:13:45.418 --> 01:13:48.113
we found out that 
it went to her bike lock.

01:13:50.168 --> 01:13:51.499
I was chained

01:13:51.524 --> 01:13:54.865
I was chained to a 
pink futon for 9 hours.

01:13:56.377 --> 01:14:00.170
While she study of an art 
history final 3 feet away.

01:14:01.061 --> 01:14:02.393
Peter.

01:14:02.868 --> 01:14:05.793
- Just last month, she was...
- Peter, stop.

01:14:07.941 --> 01:14:09.585
Oh shit.

01:14:32.031 --> 01:14:33.185
How long before they...

01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:34.553
Whoa...

01:14:50.171 --> 01:14:51.756
Ahh!

01:14:52.168 --> 01:14:54.109
Aahhhh!

01:14:56.417 --> 01:14:59.584
Ahhh!
Aahhh!

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.303
Peter!

01:15:33.282 --> 01:15:34.792
Peter?

01:15:37.338 --> 01:15:38.738
Peter?

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:46.527
Ha ha ha...

01:15:46.845 --> 01:15:48.910
Oh my god!

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:56.102
Peter!

01:15:57.793 --> 01:15:58.980
NOOO!

01:15:59.005 --> 01:16:00.866
PETER !!!

01:16:05.445 --> 01:16:07.272
Peter!

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:42.947
Where's Carly?

01:16:42.972 --> 01:16:44.741
You're not going to 
shoot me again, are you?

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:48.748
If there's 1 scratch on her.
I will.

01:16:48.773 --> 01:16:51.274
She's sleeping,
go see for yourself.

01:16:59.152 --> 01:17:01.416
- Mom?
- Carly.

01:17:01.441 --> 01:17:04.138
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:17:04.163 --> 01:17:06.828
Oh. No, baby, 
you don't have to apologize.

01:17:06.853 --> 01:17:09.064
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:17:09.695 --> 01:17:13.120
I-I should have told you
I was going to see him.

01:17:13.145 --> 01:17:14.340
Wait, what?

01:17:14.365 --> 01:17:15.841
I should have asked you.

01:17:15.866 --> 01:17:18.297
I'm sorry. 
I just...just...

01:17:18.322 --> 01:17:20.881
I want to see him so badly.

01:17:22.215 --> 01:17:23.993
Okay.

01:17:37.462 --> 01:17:39.137
You okay?

01:17:39.541 --> 01:17:40.996
No.

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.353
She okay?

01:17:45.378 --> 01:17:46.765
What the hell were you thinking?

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:50.015
She shows up at your house and
you take off with her like that?

01:17:50.117 --> 01:17:51.317
Listen.

01:17:51.342 --> 01:17:54.168
- It's still kidnapping.
- That's not what happened.

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:55.835
I didn't even know 
she was on the boat.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.035
Oh, yeah.
Tell that to the judge.

01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:59.860
If I wanted to take her,
we would be gone already.

01:17:59.962 --> 01:18:03.396
Oh. So, this is just a nice father,
 daughter boat ride, huh?

01:18:03.421 --> 01:18:06.877
Well, I was going to take her back,
once I can do that without getting shot.

01:18:06.902 --> 01:18:09.175
Sorry I'm a little selfish that way.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.791
It's hard to believe someone 
would put a shake in the lake.

01:18:11.816 --> 01:18:14.596
You know, people are dead
because of you.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.784
Yeah, I know that.

01:18:18.301 --> 01:18:21.552
Once you and Carly are off 
this boat, I'm going to end this.

01:18:21.588 --> 01:18:24.100
You're in violation of your parole.

01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:26.785
When we get off this boat,
you're going right back to jail.

01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:28.624
That's not happening.

01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:32.618
What would you do 
to see your daughter?

01:18:32.643 --> 01:18:33.737
She's my daughter.

01:18:33.762 --> 01:18:35.821
- What would you do to see her?
- I'll do anything.

01:18:35.846 --> 01:18:37.520
Me too.

01:18:37.866 --> 01:18:40.597
Except I wouldn't take 
her away from you.

01:18:41.642 --> 01:18:43.824
I wouldn't do that to her.

01:18:43.905 --> 01:18:46.400
You took care of her
when I couldn't.

01:18:46.425 --> 01:18:49.282
You probably think that 
I hated you all these years.

01:18:49.716 --> 01:18:51.930
That's not even close.

01:18:52.204 --> 01:18:55.095
You're the best thing 
that ever happen to her.

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:57.709
I know that.

01:18:58.392 --> 01:19:00.577
But, I'm still her dad
and I'll do whatever it takes

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:02.641
to be a part of her life.

01:19:08.096 --> 01:19:08.975
Ow.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.937
- Carly.
- Get her.

01:19:13.273 --> 01:19:15.312
Go.
Go, come on.

01:19:20.512 --> 01:19:21.755
Carly!

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:23.362
Carly!!

01:19:24.138 --> 01:19:26.769
Carly!
Carly!

01:19:26.794 --> 01:19:28.406
Carly!

01:19:37.419 --> 01:19:39.071
Carly.

01:19:39.589 --> 01:19:41.538
Behind you!

01:19:45.523 --> 01:19:47.193
Carly!

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.116
Carly, you okay?
Alright, let's go back.

01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:08.421
Okay. You'll be fine.
Just go back to the boat.

01:20:08.446 --> 01:20:11.434
Just hang on.
Hang on to me, sweetheart.

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:15.063
Clint!

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:21.344
Carly, swim.
Swim.

01:20:27.151 --> 01:20:29.502
Come on, Carly.
Swim!

01:20:48.097 --> 01:20:49.552
Dad!

01:21:04.431 --> 01:21:06.351
Arhhh!

01:21:42.612 --> 01:21:44.394
Thank you.

01:21:46.049 --> 01:21:48.172
Shouldn't I be saying that?

01:21:49.032 --> 01:21:50.469
If you hadn't...

01:21:50.494 --> 01:21:53.119
Carly...
That thing would have...

01:21:53.290 --> 01:21:54.642
It didn't.

01:21:54.667 --> 01:21:56.594
She's going to be fine.

01:21:58.201 --> 01:21:59.885
Mom?

01:22:01.254 --> 01:22:03.281
Mom!

01:22:06.753 --> 01:22:08.962
Come on.
Come on.

01:22:28.676 --> 01:22:30.195
Hey, Miss.

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.405
Over here.

01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:34.356
Lake county sheriff. We're going to 
need to borrow your phone.

01:22:40.417 --> 01:22:42.543
Should have seen the fish.

01:22:51.939 --> 01:22:53.882
He'll be here soon.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.545
What now?

01:22:58.570 --> 01:23:00.247
I don't know.

01:23:03.249 --> 01:23:05.935
Clint.
You should go.

01:23:25.523 --> 01:23:27.311
I'm done running.

01:23:29.539 --> 01:23:31.669
I miss too much already.

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:39.762
He saved my life.
He saved Carly's life.

01:23:39.787 --> 01:23:41.674
He can't spend his life 
sitting in jail.

01:23:41.699 --> 01:23:43.952
You have to do 
something about this.

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.185
Time to go, Mr. Gray.

01:23:56.210 --> 01:23:59.029
Go where?
Where is he going?

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:03.301
We just need to ask him 
a few questions, that's all.

01:24:05.357 --> 01:24:07.050
You're going to see 
your dad real soon.

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.817
I promise.

01:24:14.619 --> 01:24:16.111
Carly.

01:24:17.654 --> 01:24:19.096
Ready?

01:24:31.798 --> 01:24:33.470
You okay?

01:24:34.999 --> 01:24:36.746
Hey, Don.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.614
You got your shark.

01:24:40.689 --> 01:24:42.335
Yeah yeah yeah.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.617
Not a bad night.

01:24:43.642 --> 01:24:46.123
You clean up the lake 
and the street.
