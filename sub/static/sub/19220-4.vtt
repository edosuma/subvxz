WEBVTT

00:05.120 --> 00:07.040
Let the fun commence.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.440
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:14.760 --> 00:18.720
'Eight new, unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:18.800 --> 00:21.680
'But what they don't know is...'
Fuck.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.680
'...there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:25.760 --> 00:28.440
My arse fell out of my shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:28.520 --> 00:30.480
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:30.560 --> 00:33.440
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:33.520 --> 00:37.240
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:37.320 --> 00:39.040
(cheering)

00:41.920 --> 00:44.760
'Some exes want romance.'

00:44.840 --> 00:47.080
I do really, really love him.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.560
'Some want revenge.'

00:49.640 --> 00:52.920
(screaming)
Let go now!

00:53.000 --> 00:55.120
No one fucking likes you!
See you later.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.240
'And others just want
to wreck the gaff.'

00:58.320 --> 01:01.160
(shattering)

01:02.560 --> 01:04.360
That'll be someone's head.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.880
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment.'

01:07.960 --> 01:10.280
Gonna be fireworks.
'Causing misery.'

01:10.360 --> 01:12.600
(crying)

01:12.680 --> 01:14.760
You will never, ever have me again.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.600
'Mayhem.'
Fucking dickhead.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.320
(screaming)

01:18.400 --> 01:20.560
'And madness.'

01:20.640 --> 01:23.440
'It's gonna get explosive.'

01:23.520 --> 01:25.600
You fucking what?

01:28.680 --> 01:31.560
'Five exes have already arrived.'

01:31.640 --> 01:33.720
'Whose...'

01:33.800 --> 01:35.520
Slag, slag, slag, slag, slag.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.000
'...ex...'

01:37.080 --> 01:38.360
'...is...'

01:39.640 --> 01:43.040
'...next?'
My heart is breaking.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.880
I woke up. I'm a little rough,

02:10.960 --> 02:14.320
but it was nice to spend my night
in the penthouse with ZaraLena.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.120
I could've got a shag with Maisie,

02:18.200 --> 02:21.800
by I do fancy ZaraLena,
so I'm gonna play the waiting game.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.160
I'm not gonna play too long though.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.400
Pissed off
that ZaraLena's come downstairs,

02:32.480 --> 02:34.920
after not only spending
the night with Aaron.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.960
She peacocking about it in my face.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.960
You gave him a kiss and fell asleep.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.800
As soon as sees that Aaron sees
that ZaraLena's dry,

02:42.880 --> 02:44.800
I'm gonna jump on that cock.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.200
I must say, you look like
a different woman, to be honest.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.480
Well, what can I say?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.360
(they laugh)

02:51.440 --> 02:54.520
Right now, I've got Aaron
on my mind, priority number one.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.920
Finally, someone actually fit
has come into the villa.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.800
My head is turned.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.200
Head's all over the place.
I told you all that I like her

03:05.280 --> 03:08.320
and she's in the penthouse
with Aaron. I'd rather it be me.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.520
I'd love to spend time with her.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.800
Last night I was mortified
and I wanted to go home

03:13.880 --> 03:18.240
cos Sean told us that he's liked her
all along. What the fuck?

03:18.320 --> 03:21.800
I'm not going anywhere today.
I'm not giving him that much space.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.360
I'm gonna watch
what he gets up to with Zara.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.880
Harriette kicks off again with Jack.
You don't wanna see me happy.

03:34.120 --> 03:37.600
It's a bit annoying. The fact that
the girl that I'm seeing

03:37.680 --> 03:39.280
is arguing with her ex.

03:39.360 --> 03:43.000
At the end of the day, I beat him
once. I'll beat him again.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.960
I'm not getting involved with this.
We're pretty solid right now.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.560
This is gonna work, so...

03:52.080 --> 03:53.760
You're browner than me as well.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.800
I can't really read Nicole.

03:55.880 --> 04:00.000
I don't know if she thinks I'm
a joke, a friend or she likes me.

04:00.080 --> 04:03.000
I feel like I'm doing limbo
and I'm stuck underneath.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.680
Me and Josh, we're really close.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.840
He's a good-looking boy.
I fancy him.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.160
Want me to rub sun cream
on your back, Nic?

04:10.240 --> 04:16.040
At the same time, I feel like I just
love my ex, Jack Fraser, so much

04:16.120 --> 04:17.920
and he's not here.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.600
I don't feel like I can sleep
with anyone else.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.720
I wouldn't be able
to physically do it.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.360
(chuckles)

04:28.320 --> 04:31.440
'Nicole's ex, Jack Fraser,
is on her mind,

04:31.520 --> 04:35.880
but will he be on his way?
Whose ex is next?'

04:35.960 --> 04:37.920
(maniacal laughter)

04:42.040 --> 04:43.360
(tablet chimes)

04:43.440 --> 04:45.080
Oh, for fuck's sake.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.880
The fucking Tablet of Terror.

04:46.960 --> 04:51.160
"Morning, everyone. It's date time
for Sean and ZaraLena."

04:51.240 --> 04:53.240
Nice one, Tablet of Terror,
you twat.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.800
"Be prepared to get slippery
and wet."

04:55.880 --> 04:57.760
I'm done with their relationship.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.360
It's getting way too awkward
and that's Sean's fault, not mine.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.440
This is gonna be slightly awkward.

05:04.520 --> 05:08.120
I'm looking at Zahida straight away.
You can tell she ain't happy.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.480
If them two wanna crack on,
then let them be.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.920
There's plenty of girls
that I can go for.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.920
Enjoy yourself. Don't smile.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.640
Have a good day, mate.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.600
If there's been a kiss,
I'm not gonna be impressed.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.920
And she will know
that I'm not impressed.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.680
'Sean's been given a second chance
with ZaraLena,

05:34.760 --> 05:37.920
but will he be getting that
sinking feeling all over again?'

05:38.000 --> 05:41.440
Oh, my fucking God. Graceful.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.560
Things were said between us.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.320
I've got the opportunity
to find out how she feels.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.440
What's the crack with Aaron?
You stayed in the penthouse.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.960
I was a little bit gutted.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.920
I do fancy Aaron and he is my type,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.440
but I'm getting vibes
that he is a bit of a player.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.200
I've made it clear to Aaron, I don't
wanna be a girl he fucks and chucks.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.120
I don't wanna make
a dick of myself.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.880
I'm gonna see what happens there,
but if he fucks me about, I'm gone.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.520
I'm not gonna lie, we do click.
Yeah.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.600
If Zahida wasn't here,
then things would 100% be different,

06:14.680 --> 06:16.800
but she is here
and this is the problem.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.280
We came here as singles,
at the end of the day.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.800
He cracked on with Zahida.
He should've been patient.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.720
He jumped in dick first
and he's fucked his options.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.040
I think, for now,
we are just friends.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.200
'ZaraLena has put an end
to Sean's games,

06:40.280 --> 06:43.480
but the Tablet of Terror's
just started playing.'

06:43.560 --> 06:47.320
'Ross, Josh and Nicole
have been sent to the beach.'

06:48.520 --> 06:50.920
I'm a nervous wreck.
I'm like a shitting dog.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.880
I'm absolutely shitting myself. My
arsehole has got its own heartbeat.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.560
It could be one of mine.
Everything's going decent for me.

07:00.640 --> 07:04.200
I've sorted things with Harriette.
She wants to be with me.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.360
And now an ex could be coming.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.840
I'm shitting it.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.920
You two are getting close.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.840
I've been grafting on Nicole.
The last thing I need

07:13.920 --> 07:18.320
is a girl coming out of this sea
and fucking it all up for me.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.200
I'm fucking nervous as fuck.
I soiled my underwear.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.440
I've got two exes,
Adam and Jack Fraser.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.960
Adam, I don't talk to him.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.080
Adam, I was with for
a year and a half. He cheated on me.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.480
My ex Jack, obviously,
I still, like, love.

07:33.560 --> 07:37.640
I've never had a closure in the
last couple weeks so I can move on.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.200
Oh, mate.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.880
Fuck this.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.880
I'm fucking shitting myself.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.320
Oh, fuck, it is Adam.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.840
Is that your ex?
(laughs) Is that your ex?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.040
What's happening, mate?
You all right?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.120
That's a relief.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.720
This is the shittest thing possible
that could've come today.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.080
What if she's in love
with the geezer? Then I'm fucked.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.480
Are you Nic's ex?

08:18.560 --> 08:20.760
I don't like him. He cheated on me.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.760
Adam ain't nothing
but a baked bean mug.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.880
I'm Adam. I'm from north London.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.400
Most of the girls I get with
turn psycho on me.

08:32.480 --> 08:37.039
Start to attack me, scratch my car.
(laughs)

08:37.120 --> 08:40.480
I've only had one serious girlfriend,
Nicole.

08:40.559 --> 08:43.640
She found out I cheated.
That turned her a bit crazy.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.320
I'm here to tell Nicole
to leave me alone

08:46.400 --> 08:50.400
cos she's single, I'm single and
she's still trying to cock block me.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.120
You all right, Nicole?

08:52.200 --> 08:54.120
Yeah, you?
Yeah, I'm good.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.960
How are you?
Fine, thanks.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.440
I've come here to tell you
to stop cock blocking me.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.200
Nicole's jealous. We're not together
and she won't let girls near me.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.000
She's messaging girls,
"Stay away from Adam."

09:06.080 --> 09:08.040
No, I didn't. I never spoke to her.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.240
I couldn't give a shit if you
shagged someone in front of me.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.720
Don't look at this girl like
she's some lovely girl. She's not.

09:14.800 --> 09:18.040
They know me. I ain't a psycho.
I'm not a psycho.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.920
She's a fucking liar.
You fucked me over.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.960
You cheated on me.
I never done nothing to you.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.000
You've come here, giving it to me
for something I said.

09:27.080 --> 09:30.960
You should've been respectful,
gone, "Hi, Nic, you all right?"

09:31.040 --> 09:35.200
But you can't do that. You cheated
on me! You cheated on me!

09:35.280 --> 09:36.600
You cheated on me!

09:36.680 --> 09:38.400
What the fuck's going on here?

09:42.760 --> 09:45.400
Who does Adam think he is,
giving her shit?

09:45.480 --> 09:47.520
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

09:47.600 --> 09:50.160
Don't square up to me.
You've come up to me.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.280
He starts coming at me,
getting in my face. Come on, mate.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.440
Why so much anger?
Shut your mouth.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.760
Don't tell me to shut up.
Why have you got so much anger?

09:58.840 --> 10:01.000
What are you squaring up to him for?

10:01.080 --> 10:05.000
Why have you got so much anger? It
can't be over that. That's pathetic.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.840
He upset about a lot more
than he's letting on, mate.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.600
The way he just acted, that would
not be over me cock blocking him.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.920
That would be because he's hurt.
Horrible little cunt, mate.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.320
Fucking girl.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.480
It's clear Adam and Nicole
have history.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.880
I don't feel like it's love.
It's hate.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.440
(tablet chimes)

10:24.520 --> 10:26.880
Oh, for fuck's sake.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.560
"Welcome to the beach, Adam."

10:28.640 --> 10:31.160
"You're off on a date with Nicole,

10:31.240 --> 10:34.040
but will you stir up
any old emotions?"

10:34.120 --> 10:35.440
Is this happening?

10:35.520 --> 10:38.800
Why don't you go before
it starts getting heated again?

10:38.880 --> 10:40.480
What are you playing at?

10:40.560 --> 10:42.640
He's just come at me
like no tomorrow

10:42.720 --> 10:45.440
and now I've gotta go
on a date with him. Seriously?

10:46.560 --> 10:48.160
All right.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.920
Adam and Nicole need to have a chat.
I don't wanna be there.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.760
That's gonna be fucked, mate.
Yeah.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.360
Nicole's fucking annoying me.
Hopefully we can talk like adults.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.560
I'm on this date with Adam
and we're sitting there in silence.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.360
It's fucking awkward.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.560
The only good thing is that we're
cocktail making and I need a drink.

11:29.160 --> 11:33.200
'Ah, nothing like a pint of vodka
to wash away your worries.'

11:36.720 --> 11:40.360
'The daters might be silent, but
Ross and Josh are back from the beach

11:40.440 --> 11:42.440
with plenty to say about Adam.'

11:43.560 --> 11:46.680
I don't think that date
with Nicole and Adam can last long.

11:46.760 --> 11:50.600
I think it's a "You're a dick.
Drink in your face. Fuck off."

11:50.680 --> 11:52.600
No one's gonna get on with Adam.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.040
He's come in full speed.
Gone in hard. I think he's a prick.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.960
'While the boys get their backs up,

11:59.040 --> 12:01.760
Zahida's mind is elsewhere.'

12:01.840 --> 12:05.920
Don't know what to think. The worst
version of events, for me, to unfold

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
would be that Sean and ZaraLena
have had a kiss.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.000
I don't think I can trust Zara.

12:12.720 --> 12:13.720
Heya.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.680
OK? Did you have fun together?

12:15.760 --> 12:17.400
No.

12:17.480 --> 12:21.200
Zara and Sean walk in.
She's wearing this shit black dress.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.560
She looks like a slutty Voldemort.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.040
You look a bit nervous.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.920
Yeah, it was a good date.
Did you kiss each other?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.960
No, we didn't.
Why do you look so nervous?

12:31.040 --> 12:34.240
I feel like ZaraLena is into Sean,

12:34.320 --> 12:38.440
but I feel like she's a lot more
scared about what Zahida would do.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.880
Sean told me how he felt.
I put him straight.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.760
I'm not interested.
It's simple as that.

12:43.840 --> 12:47.200
Zara fancies Aaron. That's sweet.
I'll go back to Zahida.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.920
I've said who I fancy.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.400
I don't think Sean's took it very
well, but ZaraLena is fucking mine.

12:54.480 --> 12:58.000
Hello.
Hi. You have nothing to worry about.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.520
Here we go.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.840
Everything's straight now.
I've said I'm not interested.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.920
He made his decision
when he came in.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.960
I've never looked at him like that,
so that's it.

13:08.040 --> 13:12.280
She's still fucking looking at me
like there's still an issue.

13:12.360 --> 13:16.360
Girl, get it in your head.
I do not want your sloppy seconds.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.920
He's getting me involved in
a love triangle I don't wanna be in.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.440
There's no love there for me,
so why am I in it?

13:23.520 --> 13:25.040
I still fucking hate her.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.160
'The silent standoff is over

13:34.240 --> 13:37.960
and Adam's ready to reveal
the source of his rage.'

13:38.040 --> 13:40.200
The reason why I got pissed off

13:40.280 --> 13:43.840
is because I never got
emotionally attached with no one.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.400
When I broke up with Nicole,

13:45.480 --> 13:49.480
she straight away went
into a relationship and it hurt me.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.560
Straight going into a relationship,

13:51.640 --> 13:53.800
not even within a month
of us breaking up.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.240
That hurt me.

13:55.320 --> 13:59.320
Me and Nicole was together every day
for a long time, so...

13:59.400 --> 14:02.120
...yeah, it was hard to get over her
when I see her.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.040
I wanted to get that off my chest.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.920
I'm glad you got it off your chest,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.240
but you've gotta remember
that you cheated on me

14:09.320 --> 14:11.440
and I was broken and you know I was.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.560
And then our relationship
fell apart.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.480
I might've got with Jack Fraser
fairly quickly,

14:16.560 --> 14:18.680
but you can't put a time on love.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.680
I met someone else who treated me
like a princess

14:21.760 --> 14:23.640
and not like what you did.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.640
What does Adam expect me to do, sit
and cry for him? I don't think so.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.440
All right, I don't wanna argue
with you the whole time.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.960
I'm gonna leave it as that.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.200
I don't think we resolved anything.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.360
It's best we just leave it behind us.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.200
'As the villa awaits Nicole and Adam,

14:43.280 --> 14:47.520
the boys are getting territorial
about the arrival of the new ex.'

14:47.600 --> 14:50.520
What's he like?
Aggressive as fuck, mate.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.240
Adam ain't coming to my villa
And telling us fuck off.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.560
He can fuck off.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.560
They should come back and be civil.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.720
If Adam comes in here and pipes up
to Nicole while I'm here,

15:00.800 --> 15:03.800
I will tell him straight away.
He sounds like a dick.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.640
There's no chance
he's getting in Nicole's face.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.400
Guys, guys, we've got some arrivals.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.040
How's it going? nice to meet you.
'Oh, you really showed him.'

15:25.120 --> 15:27.080
To be fair, he seems like a good lad.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.920
Shakes my hand and apologises.
I actually like him. Top guy.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.560
How're you feeling?

15:39.640 --> 15:42.320
Straight away,
he said sorry to Josh and Ross.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.200
I thought he was gonna kick off.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.040
At least you've come back
on a bit of a happy vibe.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.840
The boys seem to be
up Adam's ass a little bit.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.120
I've never seen guys act like that.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.480
I only thought girls done that.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.280
(they laugh)

15:57.600 --> 16:00.360
'The boys are laughing,
but the joke will be on them

16:00.440 --> 16:03.160
when the next ex invades the villa.'

16:04.160 --> 16:06.840
'Whose ex is next?'

16:10.680 --> 16:13.040
'Sean's attempt to make a move
on ZaraLena

16:13.120 --> 16:15.240
has got the girls fired up.'

16:15.320 --> 16:19.120
'And they're going full-on feminist
for their fellow sister.'

16:19.200 --> 16:23.560
As girls, we need to kind of tell
you how we feel about you and Sean.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.840
Should I get pissed
before this is said?

16:25.920 --> 16:27.760
No, I think you should stay sober.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.480
He tells you how he feels last night

16:31.560 --> 16:34.480
and you kind of put things to bed
a bit, didn't you?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.680
And then you go
and got in bed with him.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.280
I do feel like she's gonna get
seriously hurt.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.160
It's a fucking comfort.
It's not the end of the world.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.920
It's just some fucking
sex, kissing and cuddling.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.840
Sorry, girls, how does it concern you
that I wanna get wet?

16:48.920 --> 16:51.480
The problem is it's affecting
us girls now,

16:51.560 --> 16:54.120
especially me,
cos you are clearly bothered.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.720
ZaraLena,
I don't care about your opinion.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.840
Shut the fuck up
and get out of my face.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.680
He says he fancies me,
everyone's down my throat.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.240
I'm pissed off.
It's not fair on everyone else.

17:05.319 --> 17:08.560
(belches) That is what I think about
what you just said.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.280
'Girl... power?'

17:19.880 --> 17:23.119
'The villa's at ease
after the new arrival.'

17:24.800 --> 17:28.000
'But Adam has even more bad news
for Nicole.'

17:28.079 --> 17:30.040
Nicole's been banging on about her ex

17:30.120 --> 17:33.320
and how he was better than me
and how he treated he better.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.400
but I know a few secrets
about her ex.

17:37.840 --> 17:42.640
Well, a friend of mine told me they
see your boyfriend at the time...

17:44.680 --> 17:45.880
Jack?
Jack.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.400
I found out he cheated on her.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.840
A girl leave his room,
about 6.00, 7.00 in the morning.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.920
I just feel absolutely mortified
right now.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.640
It's just so hard.

18:09.760 --> 18:13.120
I didn't... Well, I couldn't tell you
at the time, obviously.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.160
I didn't feel good telling Nicole.
I knew it'd hurt her.

18:16.240 --> 18:20.480
But I'd rather tell her now rather
than her hearing about it later.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.560
I'm a good girl and you know I am.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.440
I'm loyal. I was loyal to you.
I never cheated on you

18:26.520 --> 18:28.240
and I never would've.

18:28.320 --> 18:32.200
It's the same when I got with Jack.
I stood by him like I stood by you.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.160
I just feel like I've been
completely mugged off.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.520
I wish Jack was here
so I could ask him.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.280
I just feel
absolutely heartbroken over it.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.800
That is one of the hardest things
I've ever had to face.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.680
I proper, proper did love him
and I do.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.240
I would never be able
to forgive him for that.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.840
I told Josh that Adam told me
I've been cheated on again.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.040
He was just like,
"Fucking hell, Nic."

19:16.120 --> 19:18.720
I think he actually
does feel for me, to be fair.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.520
Nicole thinks every geezer
is shit and cheats.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.080
I don't do that. I'm a nice guy.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.320
And I hope that
she can see that in me.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.240
She's the only girl I like in here.

19:38.440 --> 19:43.320
I feel heartbroken, but I've got
Josh that will help me through it.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.520
That's the way forward
at the moment.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.440
I've gotta time it right.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.200
It's all about precision and timing
in this place.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.320
'Tonight in the villa, taking
your time seems to be on trend.'

20:06.400 --> 20:08.800
Neither of us have not had sex yet.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.200
When I like somebody,
I do it properly.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.960
I'm gonna make him mine.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.160
Last night, me and Aaron,
we had a bit of a kiss and a cuddle.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.840
Tonight will be the same story.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.440
'And although Zahida hasn't taken
the girls' advice,

20:24.520 --> 20:26.840
she definitely taking something.'

20:26.920 --> 20:29.200
I'm not gonna listen
to what the girls say.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.160
If I wanna bed Sean, I'll bed him.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.600
I woke up this morning next to Sean.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.480
After everything, I've still got him
wrapped around my little finger.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.920
He still put his willy in us.

20:57.280 --> 21:01.280
I have no idea what's going on.
She's cracking on with Aaron.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.240
It's none of her business.
She needs to stay out of it.

21:04.320 --> 21:08.000
'Me and Zara ended up in bed again
last night, but it's only cuddles.

21:08.080 --> 21:12.480
Basically, if Zaralena doesn't put
out, the only other option is Maisie.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.240
I need a minute with Aaron,
where we can have a chat,

21:15.320 --> 21:16.880
put our cards on the table.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.360
I need ZaraLena to fuck off
for a bit.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I took Nicole up to the penthouse,

21:23.080 --> 21:25.800
woke up, she's nowhere
to be fucking seen.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.600
(laughs) What the fuck do I do?

21:27.680 --> 21:30.240
It was a right nice sleep thought,
wasn't it?

21:35.320 --> 21:37.080
I don't know what the crack is.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.400
I feel like Nicole
goes for the bad boys.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.280
I need to throw in
that I've cheated on my ex bird

21:42.360 --> 21:44.680
and then she might go with me.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.040
It took Josh about an hour yesterday
to make me smile.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.520
I just feel so sad. It's like
I've got a hole in my heart

21:51.600 --> 21:54.200
and that can't go
until I know the truth.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.600
I'm not sure if I believe Adam.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.160
I don't know what's real
and what's not.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.840
She came down this morning,
Zara did,

22:07.920 --> 22:12.000
and said to me, "You've done a good
job of staying away from Zahida."

22:12.080 --> 22:15.800
Zara, just, fucking hell, who are
you? I don't even know who you are.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.640
I think I need to talk to her.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.880
It's not that. It's what you've said.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.200
"Nice job staying away from Z."

22:25.280 --> 22:28.640
I'm getting so bored
being involved in her drama.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.520
I thought he was leading you on.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.720
What the hell
has it got to do with you?

22:33.880 --> 22:36.480
Next time,
I'll keep my big gob shut.

22:40.680 --> 22:45.040
She doesn't want us to get with him.
It's probably cos she fancies Sean.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.160
That girl's gonna have a shit night.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.200
'Zahida can't curb her jealously.'

22:51.280 --> 22:56.160
'But will the green-eyed monster
strike when the next ex washes up?'

22:56.240 --> 22:58.720
'Whose ex is next?'

23:00.800 --> 23:03.160
'The competition for love
is heating up,

23:03.240 --> 23:06.320
so the Tablet of Terror
has sent the singles go-karting

23:06.400 --> 23:09.400
to stir up
some not-so-friendly rivalries.'

23:09.480 --> 23:14.000
(all) Three, two, one, Green Team!
Adam vs Josh. Exes vs exes.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.480
I've been put on Garfield's team.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.000
(all) One, two, three (indistinct)

23:19.080 --> 23:20.600
Ross is against Jack.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.680
There's been competition. I don't
think it's gonna be different today.

23:37.160 --> 23:40.240
Jack, I've nicked your bird.
I'm gonna take the trophy.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.560
I'm gonna fucking smash Josh.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.120
No chance of winning.
I can beat him on the track

23:47.200 --> 23:49.760
And I'm gonna beat him
to get Nicole.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.720
He's shit at this, he is.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.760
Ross is a bit of a racer.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.360
We've been in competition
the whole time.

23:56.440 --> 24:00.440
Don't know when Jack's gonna realise
he shouldn't compete with me.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.680
Fuck off, mate.

24:04.880 --> 24:08.240
'Action on the track might be over,
but Josh's race to win Nicole

24:08.320 --> 24:11.520
is still miles off the finish line.'

24:11.600 --> 24:15.600
What actually happened with Nicole?
I don't really know myself.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.360
I feel a bit in limbo.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.000
I don't know
what's going wrong with Nicole.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.480
I've got the looks.
I've got decent chat.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.360
Maybe Harriette can point me
in the right direction.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.080
I've got to know you

24:27.160 --> 24:31.480
and I think your joker side
takes over your sensitive side.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.680
I know I'm a joker,
but this is a bit of a front

24:34.760 --> 24:38.840
because I can't be serious with her
in case I get fucked off.

24:38.920 --> 24:42.200
You've got to tell her, you know,
how you do really feel.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.720
Josh has to be the man in this

24:44.800 --> 24:47.080
and step up and tell her
how he really feels.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.440
I think tonight would be
a really good idea.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.520
We've had such a good day.
It's all been light-hearted.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.960
Yeah.
I think tonight would be perfect.

24:55.040 --> 24:56.520
If he plays his cards right,

24:56.600 --> 24:59.600
I think things could go really far
with them two.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.560
I'm gonna pull her up
and confirm everything with her.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.280
Good boy.
Thanks for giving advice, sister.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.360
My fingers and toes are crossed.

25:11.560 --> 25:14.600
'Ah, for once,
it's smiles all around.'

25:14.680 --> 25:16.600
That's never gonna last.'

25:16.680 --> 25:18.000
(tablet chimes)

25:18.080 --> 25:20.240
(all groan)

25:20.320 --> 25:22.600
"Hello, everyone, it's date time."

25:22.680 --> 25:26.160
"Aaron and Maisie, when you've
finished polishing your helmets,

25:26.240 --> 25:28.720
you're heading
for a smashing time together."

25:28.800 --> 25:32.880
ZaraLena's got face like a slapped
arse. Wait, it's always like that.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.520
How do you feel, Zara?

25:34.600 --> 25:37.440
It is what it is.
He knows the score. It's up to him.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.160
If he wants to go there,
the ball's in his court.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.040
But I won't be waiting if he does.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.320
I'm not gonna mug her off.
And he'll get rewarded tonight.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.480
Oh!

25:46.560 --> 25:48.720
I've given my word to ZaraLena,

25:48.800 --> 25:50.920
so I hope she'll fucking trust us.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.440
Come on, then, pet. (indistinct)

26:05.960 --> 26:06.960
Hi.
You OK?

26:07.040 --> 26:09.040
You good, man?
Hiya. You OK?

26:09.120 --> 26:12.200
We turn up here
and we're smashing plates.

26:12.280 --> 26:16.320
At the end of the day, the only
thing I want smashed is my vagina.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.880
Smash it more than four times...
OK.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.160
...it means that you will have
good sex.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.400
If I smash this into four pieces,
I'm gonna be good at sex.

26:25.480 --> 26:29.080
Mate, I'll smash this cunt
into next week, you fucking radgie.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.400
Opa!
That was the worst...

26:31.480 --> 26:32.480
More than four!

26:32.560 --> 26:35.720
I've never thrown a plate
so fucking hard in my life.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.400
Opa.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.440
Three, two, one.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.800
(shrieks)

26:47.880 --> 26:51.080
That's what happened
last time I seen you.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.720
That's how you ended up inside me.
(laughs)

26:53.800 --> 26:55.760
Maisie couldn't be any more forward.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.400
She might as well take her clothes
off and get on my fucking plate.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.360
I wanna put it on the table.
You know where I stand.

27:02.440 --> 27:06.160
I'm quite honest in my opinions.
I don't wanna be mugged off.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.200
If he wants to have fun,
come with me.

27:08.280 --> 27:11.720
If you wanna fall asleep
with a cuddle, go back to Zara.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.840
I sort of know Zara a bit.
Yeah.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.800
And she a bit, like, sly.

27:15.880 --> 27:19.120
Aaron is wasting his time.
Just sack Zara off.

27:19.200 --> 27:22.560
I would never mug a friend off.
I class her as a friend.

27:22.640 --> 27:26.240
But the fact that I gave Zara my
word, I would never go back on that.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.920
I know Zara. She's not gonna put
out. Better luck next time, Aaron.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.280
I'm not here forever.
Neither am I, babe.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.760
Exactly, so let's have a bit of fun.
You know where I am.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.000
Sorry, babe, I'm out of action.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.680
'After his pep talk
with agony aunt Harriette,

27:46.760 --> 27:50.320
Josh has finally got Nicole away
from prying eyes.'

27:50.400 --> 27:53.760
Why are you over here all alone?
I wanna have a chat with you.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.200
Harriette given me some advice.
I'm gonna sit down with Nicole

27:57.280 --> 28:00.920
and have a chat with her
and air out how I feel about her.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.680
What's the crack between us two?

28:06.960 --> 28:08.320
(laughs)

28:08.400 --> 28:12.840
This is really hard
because he is such a good friend.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.400
I don't wanna fuck that up.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.480
I do like you,

28:16.560 --> 28:18.920
but, obviously, I'm not ready to...
Move on.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.560
Not at the moment.

28:20.640 --> 28:25.080
I don't know where I stand
in my own life to make a decision.

28:25.160 --> 28:28.480
Would you be pissed off if other
girls come in and I cracked on?

28:28.560 --> 28:30.920
Yeah, I probably would be
a bit pissed off

28:31.000 --> 28:33.320
cos I'm so used to being with you.

28:33.400 --> 28:37.920
I don't think she's playing us. I
think she don't know what she wants.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.680
I do like you as more than a friend.

28:40.760 --> 28:44.520
In the future, you'd be the first
person that I would speak to.

28:44.600 --> 28:48.080
He would be the perfect boyfriend,
but at this moment in time,

28:48.160 --> 28:49.880
I have no answers for him.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.000
Things progress slowly.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.000
The best things in life
are slowly progressed.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.080
So... So that's what you're saying.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.880
We're progressing slowly.
It's like baby steps.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.240
Basically, yeah.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.960
All right.

29:04.040 --> 29:08.080
I like Josh, but I need to know,
has Jack cheated on me?

29:08.160 --> 29:09.760
I need to lay it out on the table

29:09.840 --> 29:12.480
so my head can then be clear,
totally,

29:12.560 --> 29:14.040
so that I don't hurt anyone.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.960
'While the villa await
Maisie and Aaron,

29:24.040 --> 29:26.560
they've decided
to impersonate each other.'

29:26.640 --> 29:28.960
'Good thing they can all
take a joke.'

29:29.040 --> 29:31.760
I've come here to tell you
to stop cock blocking me.

29:31.840 --> 29:35.320
If I wanna crack on with girls,
don't get involved.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.320
(groans)

29:37.400 --> 29:40.160
Oi, Maisie, what the fuck
did you say, you cunt?

29:40.240 --> 29:42.520
(they laugh)

29:42.600 --> 29:44.440
Yeah, that's me, isn't it?

29:44.520 --> 29:48.000
I got a question. Hey, Nic,
how about me and you...

29:48.080 --> 29:49.880
(they laugh)

29:49.960 --> 29:52.480
It was Josh down to a T.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.680
It comes to me and I know exactly
who I'm gonna do.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.040
I'm doing an impression of Zara.

29:59.120 --> 30:03.240
Everyone's having a really good time,
but I just need to distance myself.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.160
(they laugh)

30:10.640 --> 30:14.040
I can't be bothered with this.
It's really grinding on me.

30:14.120 --> 30:17.120
Zara's not happy when someone
does an impression of her.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.320
Take it with a pinch of salt.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.560
Everyone in here is fake.
I've never said that.

30:22.640 --> 30:26.240
Basically, Zahida's just gone in
on ZaraLena.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.840
I never said everyone was fake.
Be careful.

30:28.920 --> 30:32.120
Stop taking it so seriously.
You're like the Grim Reaper,

30:32.200 --> 30:35.160
sucking people's lives and souls
out of the party.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.680
I feel like I die
every time I see her.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.360
Oi, oi!

30:40.440 --> 30:41.800
Oh, there he is!

30:41.880 --> 30:43.360
(indistinct shouting)

30:43.440 --> 30:47.880
If this is more shit, give me
my fucking suitcase cos I'm gone.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.680
What's happened on your date
and how was it?

30:51.760 --> 30:54.680
We went to a Greek restaurant.
Smashing plates.

30:54.760 --> 30:58.200
Tablet of Terror went off
and sent a photo of you two kissing.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.400
(laughs)

30:59.480 --> 31:00.960
That's a lie.
We didn't.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.640
Josh is a little shit.
Let's be honest.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.400
If I give someone my word,
I ain't gonna go back.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.520
Aaron's proved himself tonight.

31:08.600 --> 31:12.720
He's the only person and only reason
I'm still in that fucking villa

31:12.800 --> 31:14.720
dealing with this shit.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.080
'After his earlier chat with Nicole,

31:23.160 --> 31:26.680
Josh is now feeling hopeful
about their future.'

31:26.760 --> 31:29.560
I said, what if we come out of here
and we're the same.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.600
She was like,
"I'll come and see you."

31:31.680 --> 31:33.720
She keeps boys on standby

31:33.800 --> 31:36.200
so when one drops her,
she picks up the other.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.600
I just wanna see how it goes.
Do you think it will go that route?

31:39.680 --> 31:42.720
It won't though.
Listen, I'm letting you know now.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.800
She's clever.
What do you mean, she's clever?

31:45.880 --> 31:50.000
She still loves this ex-boyfriend.
Adam is stirring shit for Nicole.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.400
To be perfectly honest,

31:51.480 --> 31:54.520
I feel like he still
is madly in love with Nicole.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.680
Let me talk to you.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.480
I'm confused.
I don't know what's happening.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.480
Dude, I put my cards on the table.

32:05.560 --> 32:08.800
I said, "Would you be pissed off
if I cracked on?"

32:08.880 --> 32:11.400
She was like, "Basically."
You know what it is?

32:11.480 --> 32:13.200
She's doing this game with you.

32:13.280 --> 32:17.680
She's saying... Mate, she knows, when
she gets out, it wouldn't be that.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.400
I feel like she's confused
in this situation,

32:20.480 --> 32:23.600
but you have the pick of the bunch.
You choose and that's it.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.120
I'm not a fucking option.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.600
Shouldn't you be
in that conversation, babe?

32:28.680 --> 32:31.920
Why don't you, another ex,
go get involved?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.280
I knew he was going to.

32:33.360 --> 32:36.120
You go throw your two pence in it...
Shut up.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.240
...while Nicole's not here.
What are we talking about?

32:39.320 --> 32:41.960
They're not helping.
They're stirring it.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.760
All I'm gonna say, babe,
is exes will stir shit.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.280
Why are you earwigging?

32:46.360 --> 32:49.960
I just think it's funny,
you two getting your 2p's in.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.480
I'll say it to her.
I ain't scared of no one.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.920
I know they're not talking
anything good.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.840
I'm not gonna have it.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.600
Yeah.
Sit back.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.800
Aaron's picked up on the fact
I'm not happy. I'm not being myself.

33:10.880 --> 33:15.120
Everyone's got something to say,
but it's... I can't deal with it.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.640
ZaraLena is a tough girl, but if
someone's going at you every day,

33:18.720 --> 33:19.800
you're gonna crack.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.640
He's the only person
that's got my back.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.000
Every time Zahida's angry,
she kicks off.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.800
Thank God Aaron's got my back.
Respect, babe.

33:42.880 --> 33:46.840
The fact I like ZaraLena and
she's upset, I'm gonna lose my shit.

33:46.920 --> 33:49.720
Aaron walks past us
and he looks fucking raging,

33:49.800 --> 33:51.720
so I'm like, "What's the matter?"

33:57.080 --> 34:00.480
What the fuck? Get over it. I did
an impression of her in a game.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.720
You're a fucking bully!

34:02.800 --> 34:03.880
It wasn't just me!

34:03.960 --> 34:06.000
Don't you dare use that word on me.

34:06.080 --> 34:09.440
You're a dickhead. Who are you
talking to, you fucking idiot?

34:09.520 --> 34:13.080
It's all kicking off.
What the fuck is going on?

34:13.159 --> 34:16.280
(indistinct)
Get over it! It's a fucking game!

34:16.360 --> 34:18.280
I don't care if it's a girl
or a boy.

34:18.360 --> 34:21.120
If someone's singled out,
then I'm gonna stand up.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.600
You're a fucking bully.

34:22.679 --> 34:26.239
Fucking bully? Yeah, man.
You're the bully.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.360
Aaron is going mental.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.239
I have so much respect for him
right now.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.520
Is you fancy Zara,
that's not her fault.

34:35.639 --> 34:38.760
Zara's the one manipulating everyone
and playing a game.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.199
Zara, I'm not having someone
come up to me and call me a bully.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.280
That's not me! That's Aaron!
Because of you.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.760
I didn't crack on with Sean.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.719
Shut the fuck up!
That's got fuck all to do with it.

34:50.800 --> 34:54.679
Zip your fucking mouth
and let me speak for once!

34:54.760 --> 34:56.600
Never talk about your feelings.

34:56.679 --> 35:00.120
I didn't say it. It was Aaron.
Cos of what you said.

35:00.200 --> 35:03.040
Fuck you, Zahida,
you fucking knobhead.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.960
Bullshit. Bullshit.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.640
I'm sick of being
the only nice person in that villa

35:10.720 --> 35:12.960
and the only one getting this shit.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.000
(sighs)

35:20.960 --> 35:23.880
'As the embers of the last row
are starting to cool,

35:23.960 --> 35:27.360
Harriette decides to spark up
another fire.'

35:27.440 --> 35:29.040
I've just stuck up for you.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.920
You just sat there
and had a chat with Josh

35:32.000 --> 35:35.320
and Tweedledee and Tweedledum
are getting their 2p's in.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.720
I have no idea why Adam's
so interested in my conversation.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.520
Adam goes, "Let me talk to you."
Pulls me to one side

35:41.600 --> 35:46.480
and I went, "An ex is gonna get his
2p's in the mix and fuck that."

35:46.560 --> 35:49.520
Which is what they've done.
It's not Adam's business,

35:49.600 --> 35:50.840
but he's got involved.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.600
So, what conversations
are you lot having?

36:00.680 --> 36:03.280
Nothing about you.
Hold it a minute. Fuck off.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.720
Nicole comes over
to put her two pence in.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.880
I said to you,
if another girl comes...

36:07.960 --> 36:09.080
You'd be pissed off.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.240
You said you'd be pissed off.
Hold on.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.280
You said you'll be pissed off.
She's still lying.

36:14.360 --> 36:16.720
She's saying she loves Jack, yeah?

36:16.800 --> 36:19.920
So why would you be pissed off
if you go with another bird?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.160
I do love him.
That's what I'm saying.

36:22.240 --> 36:25.240
I'm not leading Josh on.
We've come in here as friends.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.760
Adam's just being a troublemaker,
as usual.

36:31.160 --> 36:34.760
Two of our exes are in his ear.
I didn't like it.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.240
Wait, wait.
You told me to go over there.

36:37.320 --> 36:41.480
I was being sarcastic. I said
to you, "Go put your 2p's in."

36:41.560 --> 36:45.000
Oh, my God.
As in, have a laugh.

36:45.080 --> 36:48.200
I'm not even getting involved.
It's not worth an argument.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.880
You said go over there.
It was sarcasm.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.200
Again,
Harriette and Jack are arguing.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.960
I don't have a clue
what they're arguing about.

36:56.040 --> 36:58.360
Who the fuck
are you getting lairy to?

36:58.440 --> 37:01.760
What is your even point in here?
I don't like you any more.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.440
Nicole don't like you any more.
All you're doing is stirring shit.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.520
I said, "Go put your 2p's in."
No, you didn't.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.520
You said go get involved.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.600
Yeah, I was being sarcastic
cos she's your ex.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.480
I'm not gonna respect the girl,
piping up at me

37:16.560 --> 37:19.760
when I basically sat back
and let her do what she wants.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.400
Wait, when Jack come over...

37:21.480 --> 37:23.800
Why are you guys shouting at her?

37:23.880 --> 37:25.120
Wait, what...

37:25.200 --> 37:27.680
Listen! You've got involved
in the Josh thing.

37:27.760 --> 37:31.600
Adam and Jack have got their self
so deeply involved.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.480
I haven't done anything wrong
since I've been here.

37:34.560 --> 37:37.280
You already spoiled my time in here.

37:37.360 --> 37:40.520
Nic, I swear to God...
You haven't even told me the truth.

37:42.480 --> 37:43.800
She's fucking mad.

37:43.880 --> 37:47.400
She's pissed off that she found out
the truth about Jack Fraser.

37:47.480 --> 37:50.400
I feel like everything you do
is to try and hurt me.

37:50.480 --> 37:54.360
I've told her as a friend
and she's thrown it back in my face.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.320
Are you fucking bonkers?

37:56.400 --> 37:58.840
I don't know that.
Have I spoken to him?

37:58.920 --> 38:01.480
I don't know
whether you're lying or not.

38:01.560 --> 38:05.800
I think Adam's bothered by the fact
that I wouldn't go back to him.

38:05.880 --> 38:09.000
He's being jealous kid
spitting his toys out of the pram.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.920
You're well in denial, Adam.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.960
'Nicole's staying loyal
to the man she loves,

38:18.040 --> 38:22.000
but will her world fall apart
when he finally arrives?'

38:22.080 --> 38:24.000
'Whose ex is next?'

38:24.080 --> 38:25.920
(maniacal laughter)

38:29.080 --> 38:32.120
'After an argument-filled night
in the villa,

38:32.200 --> 38:35.680
everyone seems to be exhausted.'

38:38.360 --> 38:41.120
'Well, maybe not everyone.'

38:41.200 --> 38:44.760
Mate, what the fuck, mate? Mais.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.760
we open the curtain
and see the fucking bed outside

38:47.840 --> 38:49.920
just romping back and forward.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.480
She needs to fucking shut up.

38:53.560 --> 38:57.040
Me and Adam are twiddling our thumbs
watching them going at it.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.880
We can barely get a kiss
on the lips off these birds.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.200
After everything,
me and Sean are back on.

39:05.280 --> 39:08.480
There's no getting away from me.
I'm your future, Sean.

39:12.800 --> 39:16.240
'Will Nicole confess
her secret adoration?'

39:17.305 --> 39:23.487
