WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:03.632
l'll settle my bill for the month.
Let me see it.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.170
OK.

00:06.206 --> 00:08.640
- Ah. Here you go.
- All right.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.540
Whoa.

00:13.413 --> 00:16.177
And Jill said
l couldn't control myself. Whoa.

00:17.984 --> 00:19.884
Hey, guys.
Guess what?

00:19.953 --> 00:24.117
l have just been asked to star
in my very own video!

00:24.224 --> 00:26.658
<i>[chuckling] The Al Borland Workout?</i>

00:28.495 --> 00:31.589
<i>Abs of Flab.</i>

00:31.664 --> 00:35.225
That's something you want to see,
Al in a thong.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.860
''All right, girls, two, three...
Watch those carbs.

00:37.937 --> 00:40.667
Come on. Late night snacks,
that's a no-no.''

00:40.740 --> 00:43.004
lt's not an exercise video.

00:43.076 --> 00:46.375
<i>lt's called,
How to Stock Your Toolbox.</i>

00:46.913 --> 00:51.077
l will show beginners the tools
they need and how to use them.

00:51.651 --> 00:53.551
- Actually, you'd be good at that.
- Yeah.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.554
Hey, can l be in your video?

00:55.622 --> 00:59.558
<i>We never put you on Tool Time.
Why would Al put you in a video?</i>

00:59.626 --> 01:02.356
l got a lot of experience
in dinner theater.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.625
- You were an actor?
- No, a waiter.

01:11.438 --> 01:15.067
Well, l'm sorry, but casting
is entirely up to the producer.

01:15.141 --> 01:16.506
Yeah? Who's producing it?

01:16.576 --> 01:17.736
l am.

01:18.945 --> 01:21.038
But l would have to talk to my director.

01:21.114 --> 01:23.173
Who are you getting to direct it?

01:23.249 --> 01:25.809
Well, l would need someone experienced,
you know.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.479
Who knows tools, knows television

01:28.555 --> 01:30.853
and the Al Borland personality.

01:31.558 --> 01:34.322
Boy, that will be tough.
There is no Al Borland personality.

01:34.394 --> 01:38.956
You see? That's the humor that tells me
you're the man for the job.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.164
You want me to direct it?

01:42.235 --> 01:45.204
<i>Tim, you took Tool Time
from the ground up.</i>

01:45.305 --> 01:50.004
You gave it a visual style that has not
been seen on a cable television show.

01:50.844 --> 01:54.007
- Face it. You're a legend, Tim.
- Ah, yes.

01:56.182 --> 01:58.309
There's no money in this, is there?

02:00.420 --> 02:01.978
Not a nickel.

02:03.656 --> 02:06.022
And if you could bring a sack lunch...

02:08.961 --> 02:10.895
Hey! You could film it right here.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.795
lt'd be great publicity for the store.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.733
Well, as producer,
l would have to talk to my director.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.934
Well, as director,
l would have to OK it with my producer.

02:26.012 --> 02:27.570
Yeah!

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.531 --> 03:20.658
- You got a new computer.
- [Jill] Yeah.

03:20.733 --> 03:23.759
Your father crashed my old one
for the tenth time.

03:23.836 --> 03:27.602
The guy at the store said l should get
something small and easy to hide.

03:29.108 --> 03:31.338
- lt's a really cool laptop.
- Yeah.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.571
lt really is.

03:32.645 --> 03:37.309
l have a CD-ROM, a scanner
and l'm not sure what's in that box.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.544
lt's Styrofoam packing material.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.855
- Not that.
- Oh, that's the external tape drive.

03:43.923 --> 03:48.189
l hope you know this is a lot more
sophisticated than your old computer.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.922
- OK, l'm ready to go.
- Not quite.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.965
Before you boot up your CPU you gotta
connect your peripherals.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.556
Then load all your drivers.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.465
Then you've got to load your software,

03:56.536 --> 03:59.300
making sure you still have a terminator
in your SCSl port.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.034
- What?
- You gotta program your new computer

04:02.108 --> 04:06.169
to interface with your old printer by
selecting the driver from the chooser.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.277
- Good luck.
- All right.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.610
Have fun.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.284
- Thanks, guys.
- [whistling]

04:12.352 --> 04:15.116
Hey. You got your new computer.

04:15.221 --> 04:17.154
Yippee-ai-kai-aye-ai-oh.

04:17.223 --> 04:18.781
Look at all that stuff there.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.425
<i>l hope you got my favorite game,
Monkey Town.</i>

04:23.596 --> 04:25.325
lt didn't come with any games.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.298
Boy, they saw you coming.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.538
Tim, this is not a toy.
This is a serious tool.

04:33.539 --> 04:37.031
Now come over here and see all
the way-fun stuff l got to go with it.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.939
l can't play now.
l gotta do my research.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.141
l'm directing my first ''how-to'' video.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.843
That's great. ls that for Binford?

04:44.917 --> 04:48.182
No, it's kind of a low-budget company
Al got hooked up with.

04:48.254 --> 04:49.585
But if l do the video right,

04:49.656 --> 04:52.352
l might be able to sell Binford
on doing ''how-to'' videos.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.757
l could be the next Hitchcock.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.853
Tim, Alfred Hitchcock didn't direct
any ''how-to'' videos.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.899
Not Alfred Hitchcock.
Herb Hitchcock!

05:02.802 --> 05:05.771
<i>He's famous. The first one:
How to Make a Cabinet.</i>

05:06.506 --> 05:08.770
<i>How to Repair a Rock.
That was a great one.</i>

05:10.543 --> 05:12.204
<i>How to Make a Table.</i>

05:12.278 --> 05:14.803
<i>Oh, my favorite.
How to Make a Table, Part Deux.</i>

05:17.383 --> 05:21.012
lsn't that the one you forced me
to watch on our wedding night?

05:22.655 --> 05:25.419
<i>No, that was
What to do About a Squeaky Bed.</i>

05:28.094 --> 05:31.063
And action.

05:31.130 --> 05:35.590
<i>Welcome to
How to Start Your Toolbox.</i>

05:35.668 --> 05:37.693
l'm Al Borland, your host.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.067
Al Borland.

05:41.741 --> 05:44.107
Take a stroll with me down aisle one,

05:44.210 --> 05:49.079
as we explore the exciting world
of screwdrivers.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.382
[Tim] Cut. Good. Let's move on.

05:53.453 --> 05:54.977
OK.

05:55.054 --> 05:58.023
- Where do you want me to stand?
- Out of the way.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.250
OK.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.756
This is gonna be a panoramic shot
of the screwdriver aisle.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.888
Why don't you come down here,
long shot.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.091
Let's start with
the slotted screwdrivers

06:07.166 --> 06:10.727
and zoom in on the Phillips head
and a nice dramatic tilt up

06:10.803 --> 06:12.896
to the torque screwdrivers in the back.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.873
Well, Tim, we don't have time
for all this artsy camera work.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.274
- We have two days to do this.
- l got the shots here.

06:18.344 --> 06:22.110
Well, my idea for the video
is to be simple and direct.

06:22.181 --> 06:23.671
l'll take simple and direct

06:23.750 --> 06:26.913
and expand it, mold it, shape it
and make it good.

06:28.821 --> 06:31.847
Come on, trust me, my little pumpkin.
Come on.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.294
And action.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.190
[Tim] Pull back from
the combination wrenches. Not so fast!

06:41.134 --> 06:43.864
Come on. Not so fast.
All right. Steady.

06:43.936 --> 06:45.836
Slow pan across the ratchets.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.069
Cut. Perfect.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.632
One more time.

06:52.378 --> 06:54.039
lf it was perfect, why one more time?

06:54.113 --> 06:55.239
l got a vision.

06:55.314 --> 06:57.407
Start on a tight shot
of the ratchet wrench,

06:57.483 --> 07:00.452
which is the heart and soul
of the wrench family. Can you feel it?

07:00.520 --> 07:03.956
Tim, l-l-l... We're starting
to get way behind schedule.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.186
- We have to be out by 4:00.
- Harry will let us shoot past 4:00.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.124
Yeah, sure, if you got a part for me.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.924
You know, l do a great Brando.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.329
[imitating Marlon Brando] Stella!

07:19.572 --> 07:21.665
We can be out by 4:00.

07:23.309 --> 07:24.799
Get that shot.
Just come down...

07:24.877 --> 07:28.313
All right, Manuel.
Chisel sequence, take 1 6.

07:31.684 --> 07:36.212
Focus, Al, and have some fun, buddy.
Action.

07:37.323 --> 07:38.950
Chisels...

07:46.599 --> 07:51.764
...are categorized by the type
of material that they are used for.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.002
Wood, metal, masonry.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.372
- Cut.
- What? What! What?

07:58.444 --> 07:59.809
lt's good. lt's good.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.211
Can you combine take three and take six?
A little of nine in there?

08:03.282 --> 08:04.772
All right.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.743
lmagine

08:07.854 --> 08:10.345
that your father
left your mother for a chisel.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.554
- What?
- Use that. Go with that. Go!

08:14.760 --> 08:18.127
Sorry, Tim. l'm all out of tape.
l'm gonna run to the truck and get some.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.357
[groaning]

08:20.533 --> 08:22.501
Well, it's a good time
for some make-up.

08:22.568 --> 08:24.263
Do l need a touch-up?

08:24.337 --> 08:27.602
You're fine but the tools are all shiny.
Get some powder!

08:28.174 --> 08:29.698
Who can powder?

08:29.775 --> 08:32.265
Am l the only one working on this thing?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.472
Where's the powder? Manuel!

08:35.248 --> 08:36.374
Harry!

08:37.884 --> 08:39.852
[imitating Brando] You talkin' to me?

08:41.453 --> 08:43.354
You talking to me?

08:43.422 --> 08:46.687
Harry, l can't worry about
your acting career right now.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.192
We gotta be done by tomorrow.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.489
Tim is way behind.

08:49.562 --> 08:52.622
l can't give you any more time.
l got customers outside waiting.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.960
l know.

08:55.034 --> 08:58.333
Hey, guys. You know you got customers
waiting out here?

08:58.404 --> 09:02.363
You guys are gonna have to leave!
We're shooting a video! Come on!

09:04.343 --> 09:08.302
- He is completely out of control.
- He just ran off paying customers.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.974
Uh, man, what am l supposed to do?

09:11.684 --> 09:13.242
l know what l'd do.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.115
l'd get a new director.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.348
l can't fire Tim.

09:17.423 --> 09:18.981
He's my good friend.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.925
l-l'm gonna have to reason with him.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.261
Uh, Tim.

09:26.332 --> 09:30.962
Uh, you know, l'm having a problem
with the way this is going.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.267
As your director,
l'll say you're the actor.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.307
Act like you're not having a problem.

09:35.374 --> 09:36.864
l'm also the producer.

09:37.476 --> 09:41.378
You should be worried about producing
a good performance, little bumpkin.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.610
What did l tell you about coming in?
Get out of here!

09:45.484 --> 09:49.420
You're right. You're right.
l have to fire him. How do l do that?

09:50.222 --> 09:52.713
Frankly, Al, l don't give a damn.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.731
Uh, look, Tim, about the video...

09:59.799 --> 10:01.926
Now, the way you've been going,

10:02.001 --> 10:04.765
there's no chance of us
being able to finish tomorrow.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.862
l'm glad you brought that up.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.999
We'll go back to the production company
and ask for more time.

10:10.076 --> 10:15.139
lt might be a good idea to ask them for
a little bit more do-re-mi, you know?

10:15.214 --> 10:17.375
l was thinking of getting
a new director.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.683
- You're thinking about firing me?
- You give me no choice.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.090
You've taken a simple
instructional video

10:28.160 --> 10:30.253
<i>and turned it into
Gone With the Wind.</i>

10:30.329 --> 10:34.231
Yeah, but without my help, your video
crew's gonna be gone with the wind!

10:34.300 --> 10:38.168
l think there are some people out there
who like the Al Borland style.

10:38.237 --> 10:42.196
Maybe that is why they asked me
to star in it instead of you.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.504
They picked you
'cause they couldn't afford me!

10:44.577 --> 10:46.602
You're a deluded egomaniac.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.943
And you're a chubby little flannel man.

10:50.816 --> 10:54.912
May l tempt you with some alluring
creations from our pastry chef?

10:54.987 --> 10:56.887
The tiramisu is quite fetching.

10:56.956 --> 11:00.687
- Just fetch the check, please.
- Also an excellent choice.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.250
l will take that.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.888
You're gonna buy off your guilt
by paying for dinner?

11:04.964 --> 11:06.932
- l don't think so.
- Oh, no!

11:07.033 --> 11:09.001
- Give it to me. Come here.
- Oh, no!

11:11.003 --> 11:13.767
You see?
Everything has to be done your way!

11:13.839 --> 11:15.500
- The right way.
- Fine!

11:15.574 --> 11:16.541
- Fine.
- Fine!

11:19.311 --> 11:20.869
- Fine!
- Fine.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.746
l will have to add some dessert to that.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.788
OK. What do you think
of this screen name?

11:37.663 --> 11:39.528
''Sick of tools''?

11:40.733 --> 11:42.598
- You can't use that.
- Why not?

11:42.668 --> 11:45.228
That's my screen name.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.999
Al Borland is a no-talent,
worthless bum.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.204
Tim! Guess who's here? llene!

11:55.281 --> 11:56.908
Hello, llene.
Good to see you.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.710
New perm?

11:58.818 --> 12:01.378
Why are you saying such
terrible things about my Al?

12:01.487 --> 12:03.648
'Cause your Al just fired me.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.987
Your Al fired my Tim!

12:07.393 --> 12:08.826
What happened?

12:08.894 --> 12:12.057
We had totally opposite visions
on how to produce this video.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.325
So, it was creative differences.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.164
Yeah. l'm creative, he's different.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.498
All he cared about
is schedules and budgets.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.303
Schedule, budget. Too much time...

12:23.375 --> 12:26.936
OK, look. He gave you two days
to shoot a 60-minute video.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.344
- How much did you get done today?
- Today?

12:29.415 --> 12:30.575
- The first day?
- Right.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.174
Well, you put it...
You know, you had to...

12:33.252 --> 12:36.710
You had to put it all...
Once you... About five minutes.

12:36.789 --> 12:38.723
That's all?

12:38.791 --> 12:40.691
No wonder he fired you!

12:40.760 --> 12:43.456
l've gotta go.
Al must be really hurting right now.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.360
- [Jill] OK.
- He's hurting?

12:45.431 --> 12:48.559
- l was the one that got axed.
- You've got Jill to comfort you.

12:48.634 --> 12:50.329
[scoffs]

12:50.402 --> 12:52.097
You know how to comfort me.

12:53.305 --> 12:54.863
Five minutes?

12:54.940 --> 12:58.569
- lt was a brilliant five minutes.
- You are so pathetic.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.703
And the comfort would come from?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.845
Al, come on.
We're on in ten.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.384
Thank you, Heidi.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.086
Hello, Tim.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.522
Hello, Al.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.618
Well, you gonna finish
doing that video tonight?

13:16.695 --> 13:17.992
Yes, l am.

13:18.063 --> 13:19.792
Thank you for asking.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.066
You're welcome.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.535
Well, we should have
a good show today, Al.

13:25.604 --> 13:28.539
Yes, we should.
l always enjoy sealant week.

13:32.344 --> 13:34.039
Does everybody know what time it is?

13:34.113 --> 13:36.479
<i>- Tool Time!
- That's right.</i>

13:36.549 --> 13:39.643
Binford Tools is proud to present
Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.879
[cheering]

13:45.658 --> 13:47.990
Thank you.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.493
You're too kind.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.720
Thank you.
Well.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.524
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.</i>

13:53.599 --> 13:55.567
l'm, of course,
Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.330
You all know my assistant, Al Borland.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.797
All this week it's sealant week.
Today we're talkin' about caulkin'.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.638
To help us out we have master plumber,
Felix Myman.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.874
<i>Let's bring him out
with a Tool Time welcome.</i>

14:13.919 --> 14:15.944
- Thank you.
- Always nice to have you on.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.512
- Always a pleasure to be here.
- Nice to see you again.

14:18.591 --> 14:22.618
Today Felix is gonna show us the proper
way to caulk a toilet, shower or sink.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.654
And l can also show you how to caulk
your windows and glass doors.

14:26.765 --> 14:28.062
Good, we'll see that later.

14:28.133 --> 14:32.194
ln the interest of time, why don't we
concentrate just on bathroom fixtures?

14:32.271 --> 14:36.230
Al's always interested in saving time,
even at the expense of quality.

14:36.308 --> 14:38.640
l am all for quality, but time is money.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.203
- Always money? That how you see it?
- Getting back to caulking...

14:43.415 --> 14:44.746
There are different types:

14:44.817 --> 14:47.980
Acrylic with latex,
oil-based and silicone.

14:48.087 --> 14:50.851
Marv, why don't you come in
and get a nice product shot here?

14:50.956 --> 14:54.858
Why not a panoramic shot, Tim?
Bring in a crane.

14:54.927 --> 14:58.454
We could rip off the roof
and get a shot from a helicopter.

14:59.498 --> 15:02.831
Felix, do you see any problem
with a guy showing pride in his work?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.733
l'm just here to caulk a toilet.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.606
Why don't we get back to
the different types of caulking guns?

15:09.675 --> 15:10.972
Yes, why don't we?

15:11.043 --> 15:13.910
Uh, those are electric guns.
You might want to be careful...

15:13.979 --> 15:15.207
[grunts]

15:17.683 --> 15:20.413
- ...with those triggers.
- l didn't mean to do that.

15:20.486 --> 15:21.714
You'll have to excuse Tim.

15:21.787 --> 15:24.119
He has a tough time
keeping things under control.

15:24.189 --> 15:25.884
l know how to control myself, Al.

15:31.397 --> 15:34.889
l am so sorry, Felix.
l am so sorry!

15:34.967 --> 15:37.265
- l don't need this.
- [stammering]

15:37.336 --> 15:40.567
l could be cleaning out a septic tank.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.753
Move over!

16:05.831 --> 16:08.561
<i>- [Tim] Hey, Wilson.
- Shalom, good neighbor.</i>

16:08.634 --> 16:10.329
OK.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.496
Well, you finished
your vegetable hut.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.699
l'm sure it commemorates something.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.799
<i>This, Tim, is a sukkah.</i>

16:18.510 --> 16:23.004
lt is what is built for the Jewish
harvest festival of Sukkot.

16:23.082 --> 16:24.913
Which, yes indeed, does commemorate

16:24.984 --> 16:27.544
the ancient Hebrews
wandering through the desert.

16:27.619 --> 16:31.146
l'd be wandering around
looking for the bathroom.

16:31.223 --> 16:35.159
Actually, the tribes of lsrael have
celebrated in these symbolic structures

16:35.227 --> 16:36.990
for thousands of years.

16:38.030 --> 16:41.056
lt'll be a thousand years
before l celebrate with Al again.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.693
He'll pick caulk out of his beard
till the next Sukkot.

16:44.737 --> 16:48.104
You're still smarting from the sting
of getting fired from Al's video.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.334
Well, he's impossible to work with.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.775
<i>You've worked with him
for years on Tool Time.</i>

16:52.845 --> 16:54.813
<i>That's because l'm the boss
on Tool Time.</i>

16:54.880 --> 16:56.370
Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

16:56.448 --> 16:59.713
You know, Tim, this reminds me
of a famous quote by Aristotle.

17:01.553 --> 17:05.045
''He who has not learned to obey
cannot be a great leader.''

17:05.124 --> 17:07.648
l should have let him do it his way.
l had this vision.

17:07.726 --> 17:11.492
l was gonna do something magnificent,
trying to emulate the great Hitchcock.

17:11.563 --> 17:15.124
- Alfred or Herb?
- The director! Herb.

17:15.666 --> 17:18.829
No, no, no, no, Tim. You don't
want to emulate Herb Hitchcock.

17:18.936 --> 17:21.666
- l do. He's fabulous.
- He was kicked out of the business,

17:21.740 --> 17:25.267
- That's what everybody says.
- for going wildly over budget.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.709
He hired a cast of thousands

17:26.779 --> 17:30.840
<i>for the staining scene
in How to Make a Table part three.</i>

17:30.916 --> 17:32.645
lt was brilliant.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.346
Staining a table during a chariot race.
Come on!

17:38.023 --> 17:40.958
Hand drill sequence take one.

17:41.026 --> 17:43.290
And action.

17:47.666 --> 17:51.124
Every toolbox needs a hand drill.
lsn't that right, sir?

17:51.837 --> 17:53.464
Absolutely.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.604
Cut. All right, that's good.
Moving on.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.541
One more shot we're done. Set up here,
l'll go get the props.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.774
Uh, just a quick suggestion.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.511
l think it would be great
if we ended with a song.

18:07.352 --> 18:09.912
No singing, no dancing
and no ad-libbing.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.793
- Hey, Harry.
- Go away.

18:16.862 --> 18:20.161
- l'm not gonna drive away customers.
- l'm not worried about that.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.530
l am in the middle of a performance.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.529
Hi, Al.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.472
- What are you doing here?
- Well,

18:30.542 --> 18:33.238
l'm thinking about the immortal words
of Aristotle.

18:33.312 --> 18:37.442
''Only the boss should be able to invite
a thousand people to have dessert.''

18:39.918 --> 18:42.443
Must have lost something
in the translation.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.852
You were the boss.
l should have let you do it your way.

18:46.925 --> 18:48.620
Well, yes, you should have.

18:48.694 --> 18:52.221
But l didn't and now you are
and it's working out, right?

18:52.297 --> 18:55.266
Could we?
l'm falling out of character.

18:56.502 --> 18:59.801
<i>l'll let you get back to work.
l'll see you tomorrow on Tool Time.</i>

18:59.872 --> 19:01.533
- Yeah, all right.
- Great.

19:03.575 --> 19:06.339
- Ah, wait, Tim. Tim!
- [Harry groaning]

19:06.411 --> 19:11.314
l'm getting ready for my big finale.
You know, clamps and vise grips.

19:11.383 --> 19:14.944
- Good.
- l don't know where to put the camera.

19:15.053 --> 19:17.419
- You don't need my opinion.
- l know l don't.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.218
But l want it, you know.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.556
l looked at that first five minutes.
lt was really, really good.

19:22.628 --> 19:25.188
- Right up there with Hitchcock.
- Really?

19:25.264 --> 19:26.390
Almost.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.157
OK. Um...

19:29.268 --> 19:32.601
Forget the clamps and vise grips.
You want a big finish, go to knives.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.437
Have a low pan. Have Manuel come in top
over the blades, scoot down this way.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.976
Tilt up, see all the blades
shiny and sharp.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.706
And then a big finish to...

19:41.780 --> 19:44.442
Actually, your idea would be better,
you know.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.450
- Vise grips and clamps.
- Yeah?

19:46.518 --> 19:49.146
And to simplify the shot
just shoot from here.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.382
Then there's more drama
because you see it all.

19:51.456 --> 19:54.619
Look, it's my store and l want to sing
at the end of the video.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.763
- Harry...
- No, no, no, no, no.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.855
Now there's an idea.
Hold on a minute.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.896
Your song would be much more effective
if you had a big entrance, wouldn't it?

20:05.971 --> 20:08.337
- See? Now we're talking.
- An entrance?

20:08.407 --> 20:10.466
- Maybe from the storeroom.
- Yes.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.669
You know, you could enter in here.

20:12.744 --> 20:14.371
Wait for your cue.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.210
l'm sure we can get some music in later.

20:18.951 --> 20:22.216
[pounding on door]
Hey, l can't hear the music!

20:23.288 --> 20:24.812
We're back!

20:29.394 --> 20:32.557
OK. l've loaded all the research data.

20:32.664 --> 20:35.599
- Now what do l do?
- You pay your computer consultant.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.997
How about dinner
and a roof over your head?

20:41.106 --> 20:43.267
Fair enough.

20:43.375 --> 20:47.004
Hit F9. lt will take a couple minutes
to do the calculations.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.571
Make sure you hit ''save'' when it says
''done'' or you'll lose all your work.

20:50.649 --> 20:53.083
- OK, thanks. Thanks, sweetie.
- Bye, Mom.

Hold it, hold it, hold it.

21:22.681 --> 21:25.172

right now.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.110
Have you saved my work?

21:29.187 --> 21:30.882
lt's just a bunch of numbers.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.082
Tim!

21:32.157 --> 21:35.422
Hold on, l'm 50 bananas away
from being mayor of Monkey Town.
