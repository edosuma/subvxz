WEBVTT

00:08.050 --> 00:09.824
[overlapping conversations]We're headed to court now.

00:09.870 --> 00:11.041
Dad is taking
the plea agreement.

00:11.090 --> 00:12.045
There's going to be
a two week delay.

00:12.090 --> 00:13.432
The donors!Grace.

00:13.490 --> 00:15.048
I want them to hear it
from the governor himself.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.091
Wait, this is the right
thing to do.

00:17.140 --> 00:18.391
Two years.

00:18.450 --> 00:20.611
That's the lowest
we could get.

00:20.670 --> 00:24.049
No, it was before
the verdict came in. Why?

00:24.110 --> 00:26.055
Hold on.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.977
Diane thinks we'd better
get on with the AUSA,

00:29.020 --> 00:30.669
make sure he's still
holding to the plea deal.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.971
Why?

00:32.030 --> 00:33.543
Wait. G-Grace, hold on.

00:33.590 --> 00:34.727
Has she heard something?

00:34.770 --> 00:35.930
No, but she worries

00:35.990 --> 00:36.934
about the verdict
coming In so fast.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.900
Grace, I'm going to
have to call you back.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.679
I knew he'd find
some way to screw us.

00:42.730 --> 00:43.947
ALICIA:
We agreed,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.218
Peter would take
a two years plea.

00:46.260 --> 00:47.909
That's a sitting governor,

00:47.960 --> 00:49.439
agreeing to a two
year prison sentence.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.959
The jury was out one hour.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.729
You and I both know
that means a guilty verdict.

00:52.790 --> 00:55.258
No. We don't
know anything.

00:55.310 --> 00:57.130
We know I'm not the one
running scared to you.

00:57.180 --> 00:58.522
I want four years.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.138
No.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.319
My client would
rather roll the dice.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.966
Your client is risking ten years
in prison with a guilty verdict.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.362
Ten years...

01:08.410 --> 01:09.718
away from his kids,

01:09.760 --> 01:11.011
away from you.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.139
Why don't you ask
the Blagojevich family

01:12.200 --> 01:13.542
how well they're holding up?

01:16.160 --> 01:19.721
You think you can play
the emotional card with me?

01:19.770 --> 01:22.989
You think I'm going
to break down and cry?

01:23.030 --> 01:24.941
Look at me.

01:24.990 --> 01:27.038
Do I look like
I'm breaking down?

01:30.610 --> 01:32.089
Three years.No.

01:32.130 --> 01:33.256
But here's what
we'll give you.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.346
An immediate surrender.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.130
Today. Within the hour.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.738
Peter surrenders in court.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.098
No press conference.

01:40.140 --> 01:42.529
No talk about how you
smeared his family.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.002
You get the press
cycle all to yourself,

01:44.060 --> 01:46.187
and that's the
best I'll offer.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.621
But, Dad,
you have to fight this.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.150
I can't risk being away
from you until you're 30.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.804
GRACE:
It's two years.

02:00.850 --> 02:03.023
I'm going to be
at your graduation,

02:03.070 --> 02:04.719
in the front row.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.030
I promise.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.945
I can't go to college now.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.298
Grace. You will go.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.215
You have to make us proud.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.034
You have to make
your mom forget this.

02:17.090 --> 02:18.864
Okay?

02:18.920 --> 02:20.046
[quietly]:
Okay.

02:20.090 --> 02:22.263
Now I got to
go comfort Eli.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.273
Thank you.What for?

02:30.320 --> 02:31.662
I didn't do anything.

02:31.710 --> 02:33.621
You stuck by me through
the presidential.

02:33.670 --> 02:35.228
I made a mistake
there with you,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.145
and I'm sorry for that.

02:40.810 --> 02:42.198
SHERIFF:
All rise. The Honorable Judge

02:42.240 --> 02:44.151
Richard Cuesta presiding.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.330
[bangs gavel]

02:49.340 --> 02:52.116
CUESTA: So I understand
we have a plea deal.

02:52.170 --> 02:53.512
CONNOR:
We do, Your Honor.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.199
Governor Florrick,
you are accused of bribery,

02:56.260 --> 02:58.216
obstruction of justice,

02:58.260 --> 03:00.694
and wire fraud, in the matter
of the murder trial

03:00.740 --> 03:03.436
of Patty Tanniston.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.209
Now, in accepting this plea,

03:05.270 --> 03:08.615
you acknowledge willfully
arranging the mistrial

03:08.660 --> 03:11.311
of her accused murderer,
Richard Locke,

03:11.360 --> 03:15.751
in exchange for the political
contributions of his father.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.268
And, uh, you... um...

03:19.760 --> 03:21.716
Your Honor?

03:25.900 --> 03:30.280
Before turning to your plea,
there is another matter.

03:31.820 --> 03:34.334
The jury has not yet
reached a verdict.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.299
But they do
have a question.What does that mean?

03:37.340 --> 03:38.864
CONNOR:
Your Honor, the jury's question

03:38.910 --> 03:40.423
is no longer relevant
given our plea arrangement.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.254
DIANE: Actually, the plea
has not been entered yet.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.256
CONNOR: Well, we were in the
midst of entering it, so...

03:44.310 --> 03:45.868
CUESTA:
Yes, but it appears that the

03:45.920 --> 03:48.002
defendant is rejecting the
plea deal. Is that correct?

03:48.050 --> 03:50.006
It is, Your Honor.Okay.

03:50.050 --> 03:53.269
Well, then let's listen to the
question that the jury has.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.185
I mean, I'm excited about this.

03:55.230 --> 03:57.221
Thank you.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.275
CUESTA:
From the jury: "We have read

04:01.320 --> 04:04.016
"the transcripts
of the victim's 911 call,

04:04.060 --> 04:06.585
"but we would like
to hear the call itself.

04:06.630 --> 04:08.279
"Is that possible?

04:08.330 --> 04:09.365
CONNOR:
Your Honor, sidebar, please?

04:09.420 --> 04:10.671
CUESTA:
Let's go.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.949
Why is that good?

04:14.990 --> 04:17.424
Because they're
focusing on the murder

04:17.470 --> 04:19.290
and not Dad's guilt.

04:19.340 --> 04:20.591
And we want that?

04:20.650 --> 04:22.948
'Cause we want...
want to distract them?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.958
But that doesn't
mean Dad is guilty.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.252
I know. You don't
have to sugarcoat it.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.993
LUCCA:
I need your help.

04:30.050 --> 04:33.781
Look, stop playing coy
and get in here and help.

04:33.830 --> 04:35.172
I thought the verdict
was coming down.

04:35.230 --> 04:37.653
No, the jury has a question.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.270
This is not over.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.754

somebody's trying to break in.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.579

are you hearing, ma'am?

04:51.630 --> 04:52.972
I think somebody's
trying to get in.

04:53.030 --> 04:54.418
I heard the locks
being turned.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.246
My boyfriend was supposed
to be back, but he called...

04:56.290 --> 04:57.279
Are you someplace safe,
ma'am?

04:57.340 --> 04:58.819
Have you set
all your locks?

04:58.860 --> 05:00.816
Yes, but just...
There it is again.

05:00.860 --> 05:02.373
Are you there, ma'am?

05:02.430 --> 05:04.682
Someone's trying to get in.
Wait, one second.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.254
Ma'am.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.291

ma'am? Ma'am?Yeah, I just...

05:09.780 --> 05:11.213

05:11.260 --> 05:12.431

05:12.480 --> 05:14.345
Yes, ma'am.
Just stay on the phone.

And there you have it.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.577
The 911 call.

05:20.620 --> 05:24.966
Tad, if you would escort them
back to the jury room, please.

05:25.020 --> 05:28.365
[jury conversing quietly]

05:28.410 --> 05:30.105
CUESTA:
Uh, excuse me, is there

05:30.150 --> 05:31.538
something else?Yes.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.012
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

05:33.070 --> 05:34.719
We do have_one
more question.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.761
CUESTA:
Yes.

05:35.810 --> 05:37.368
FOREMAN:
At the 48 second mark,

05:37.420 --> 05:39.593
in the transcript,
there's a sound listed as

05:39.640 --> 05:42.245
"inaudible noise."
What is it?

05:42.290 --> 05:43.507
Your Honor.Sidebar, Your Honor.

Ma'am?Yeah, I just...

Someone else's.

06:27.210 --> 06:28.598
How do you know?

06:28.640 --> 06:31.518
She was using
her cell to call 911.

06:36.350 --> 06:37.601
Your Honor, they want
to re-open this case.

06:37.650 --> 06:39.436
It was argued.
We had closing arguments.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.175
We are merely trying
to satisfy the jury's questions.

06:41.220 --> 06:43.688
No, you're not, Diane.
Don't play innocent.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.399
You're trying to shout down
the other evidence

06:45.440 --> 06:47.488
with this melodrama.Exactly.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.134
We're not the ones asking
the question, Your Honor.

06:49.190 --> 06:51.488
The jury is. They obviously
have some probative value.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.098
Well, first of all,
do we even know what this

06:53.150 --> 06:54.754
"inaudible noise" was?

06:54.800 --> 06:56.449
We do.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.888
Okay. Then this
is what I want.

06:57.930 --> 07:00.490
Bring me legal arguments
tomorrow morning

07:00.550 --> 07:03.280
as to whether the jury
should hear this evidence,

07:03.330 --> 07:06.288
and the jury will delay
their deliberations until then.

07:06.330 --> 07:07.854
No.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.333
[ratcheting sound]LUCCA: It's a ringtone.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.597
How did you find that out?

07:10.640 --> 07:11.948
I didn't. Jason did.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.469
I thought Jason
wasn't working on this.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.420
He wasn't. I asked him to.

07:15.470 --> 07:18.257
He thinks we could imply
someone else was there.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.733
DIANE:
Well, it will keep
the jury occupied.

07:19.780 --> 07:21.429
They seem to want
to chase the murder.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.640
Question is, will
Cuesta let it in.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.349
Diane, my second year...

07:24.400 --> 07:26.561
we argued something similar
to this... a bribery case?

07:26.620 --> 07:28.303
Do you have
the research?I could probably find it.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.612
It was 2010.
Something with Sweeney.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.742
Do we have it online?The briefs,
not the notes.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.574
You may want to check
the file cabinets.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.963
Looks like an all-nighter
digging up precedents,

07:37.020 --> 07:38.442
so let's get started.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.324
You should
probably thank Jason.

07:41.370 --> 07:42.587
I will.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.375
You should probably
thank him now.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.894
I will, Lucca.

07:54.950 --> 07:56.463
What's going on?

07:58.470 --> 08:01.348
Jason thinks
that if Peter goes to prison,

08:01.390 --> 08:02.778
you'll never divorce him.

08:03.830 --> 08:05.388
What?

08:05.440 --> 08:06.737
Jason just thinks...

08:06.790 --> 08:08.951
No, I heard what you said, I...

08:09.010 --> 08:11.171
What does that even mean?It means,

08:11.220 --> 08:14.223
you don't want to kick
a man when he's down.

08:14.270 --> 08:18.400
Okay, and by man,
are we meaning Jason?

08:18.450 --> 08:20.441
No. Peter.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.968
You tend _to confuse
responsrblllty and love.

08:23.020 --> 08:25.147
I...

08:26.850 --> 08:28.545
Is Jason saying all this?

08:28.590 --> 08:30.501
Some of it.
I added a few bits.

08:30.550 --> 08:32.586
Just think about it.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.370
Who do you want to come home to?

08:35.420 --> 08:36.591
Every night.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.552
Who do you want to see
when you open your door?

08:43.650 --> 08:45.550
Lucca, it's not up to me.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.566
Jason wants his freedom.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.827
Talk to him.

08:48.870 --> 08:50.178
What will that do?

08:50.220 --> 08:52.393
Talk to him.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.053
Better, better, better

09:52.110 --> 09:53.361
Will you feel

09:53.410 --> 09:59.155
Anything at all?

10:01.030 --> 10:04.500
Born like sisters
to this world

10:04.560 --> 10:08.985
In a town where blood ties
are only blood

10:09.040 --> 10:11.201
If you never say your name

10:11.260 --> 10:13.296
Out loud to anyone

10:13.350 --> 10:16.604
They can never ever
call you by it

10:16.650 --> 10:21.519
If I kiss you
where it's sore

10:21.570 --> 10:24.653
HIH$
you where it's sore

10:24.710 --> 10:29.090
Will you feel
better, better, better

10:29.150 --> 10:33.621
Will you feel
anything at all?

10:33.670 --> 10:38.016
Will you feel
better, better, better

10:38.070 --> 10:39.628
Will you feel
anything

10:39.680 --> 10:44.595
At all?

10:44.640 --> 10:51.648
All...

10:51.690 --> 10:53.248
You're getting,
getting sadder

10:53.300 --> 10:55.256
Getting sadder, getting
sadder

10:55.300 --> 10:57.473
And I don't understand

10:57.520 --> 10:59.772
And I don't
understand

10:59.830 --> 11:01.650
But if I

11:01.700 --> 11:05.215
Kiss you where it's sore

11:05.270 --> 11:08.706
If I kiss you
where it's sore

11:08.750 --> 11:13.358
Will you feel
better, better, better

11:13.410 --> 11:15.878
Will you feel
anything at all...?

11:15.930 --> 11:17.921
My God.

11:17.980 --> 11:20.756
Will you feel better,
better

11:20.810 --> 11:22.198
Better

11:22.240 --> 11:24.492
Will you feel anything [whispers]:
Stupid.

11:24.550 --> 11:25.710
At all?

11:25.770 --> 11:26.805
Will you feel

11:26.860 --> 11:29.727
Anything at all...?

11:29.770 --> 11:31.761
[song stops]

11:39.390 --> 11:42.609

12:21.910 --> 12:23.866

It saysU.S. v. Nunez.

12:29.740 --> 12:32.618
Oh. Of course. US. v Nunez.
How could I forget?

12:32.660 --> 12:34.708
[chuckles]: It's the
St. Jude of precedents.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.741
Lost causes.You've had your
closing argument,

12:36.790 --> 12:38.963
the judge instructs the jury,
you think it's over, right?

12:39.010 --> 12:41.831
But it's not.Nothing's ever over.
Remember that.

12:41.890 --> 12:43.141
Nothing.

12:43.190 --> 12:45.841
A case may be reopened
when the party so moving

12:45.890 --> 12:48.711
provides a reasonable
explanation for failure

12:48.760 --> 12:52.764
to present the evidence
in its case-in... chief.

12:52.810 --> 12:54.118
You remembered all that?Hey, I was

12:54.160 --> 12:55.764
_ the_one awake
In crImInal procedure.

12:55.810 --> 12:58.199
I was awake.[chuckles]:
No, you were not.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.206
You were always... drunk,

13:00.250 --> 13:01.683
lolling around.

13:01.730 --> 13:03.163
[laughs]
That is so not true.

13:03.210 --> 13:05.292
And I've never lolled
in my life.

13:05.340 --> 13:08.161
Okay. Tell me the name
of our professor.

13:09.780 --> 13:12.305
Ha.Oh, come on,
you don't remember his name.

13:12.350 --> 13:13.567
I do. Professor Stone.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.789
What?

13:20.840 --> 13:23.149
Nothing.

13:23.190 --> 13:25.886
It's just really good
to see you again.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.625
Again?

13:27.670 --> 13:29.581
Where was I?

13:35.510 --> 13:37.717
ALICIA:
You wouldn't like it here now.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.988
Things have gotten sad.

13:40.030 --> 13:42.339
Hmm, things were pretty
sad when I was here.

13:42.380 --> 13:44.553
No. They were never sad.

13:46.210 --> 13:47.905
Did you really hate me?

13:47.950 --> 13:49.554
[softly]: Oh, yeah.

13:49.610 --> 13:51.555
[chuckles]

13:51.610 --> 13:53.771
So what do I do?I told you.

13:53.830 --> 13:55.786
US. v. Nunez. No.

13:55.830 --> 13:57.047
In life.Oh, that.

13:57.090 --> 13:59.263
I don't know. I was
never very good at that.

13:59.310 --> 14:00.390
Yes, you were.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.749
You always made it
look so easy.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.623
Why didn't I come to you?

14:09.710 --> 14:12.531
What did you say?

14:12.590 --> 14:16.196
"It was romantic because
It didn't happen.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.889
So you got a
little bit of both."

14:19.940 --> 14:23.023
Life. Us together.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.857
And now romance.

15:14.690 --> 15:15.463
[exhales]

15:15.520 --> 15:17.476
Hey. Do you have a minute?

15:17.520 --> 15:18.953
[sighs]

15:19.000 --> 15:21.173
Sorry. Are you all right?

15:21.220 --> 15:24.303
Yeah. I'm just, uh,
studying precedents.

15:24.350 --> 15:25.476
What's up?

15:25.530 --> 15:27.179
I need you to
talk with Cary.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.219
Why?

15:28.270 --> 15:30.090
Matan won't help
and I need access

15:30.140 --> 15:31.744
to the prosecutor's work.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.188
Cary won't help me.

15:33.230 --> 15:35.095
I'm the last person
he'd help.

15:35.150 --> 15:37.926
I disagree.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.016
DIANE: US. v. Nunez.
Good.

15:40.060 --> 15:43.359
Smart. AndI got
David Boies to argue for us.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.365
It'll impress the hell
out of Cuesta.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.456
So, where are we on evidence?

15:47.510 --> 15:50.240
JASON: We're trying to find
the owner of the cell phone.

15:50.290 --> 15:51.279
We need a few more hours.

15:51.340 --> 15:53.558
I only have one witness.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.034
Can you stretch it?

15:56.080 --> 15:58.162
David Boies.
Chairman of the firm,

15:58.210 --> 15:59.472
Boies, Schiller & Flexner.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.647
Sir, you are one
of themost respected

16:01.690 --> 16:04.648
legal experts working today,
is that correct?

16:04.700 --> 16:07.134
I'd rather not say that
about myself.

16:07.180 --> 16:09.341
[chuckling]And, uh,

16:09.400 --> 16:12.267
you are here as an expert
on US. v. Nunez?

16:12.310 --> 16:13.743
I am.But first, um,

16:13.790 --> 16:15.223
tell us a little about yourself.

16:15.270 --> 16:17.181
Let's start
with your childhood.Your Honor,

16:17.230 --> 16:19.221
uh... relevance?

16:19.280 --> 16:20.622
Oh, I think the relevance...

16:20.670 --> 16:22.183
will become clear.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.231
I'll give you
a little leeway.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.977
DIANE:
Where were you born,
Mr. Boies?

16:28.030 --> 16:30.453
Things are looking
up in court?A bit.

16:30.510 --> 16:32.068
Knock on wood.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.156
I'm just trying to stay away,

16:34.210 --> 16:36.246
and focus_
on my core constituents.

16:36.290 --> 16:38.850
Which is why I wanted
to meet with you, Dwight.[chuckles]

16:38.910 --> 16:40.468
I'm not here, Peter.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.557
I'm just waiting on
my wife who's shopping.Yes, I know.

16:43.610 --> 16:46.647
But you've given a lot of money
to my campaigns over the years,

16:46.700 --> 16:49.043
and I wanted
to tell you first...

16:49.090 --> 16:51.172
this isn't over.I know.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.619
Eli told me.

16:52.660 --> 16:55.436
Good. Because there are
a lot of paths to the future.

16:55.490 --> 16:57.879
I know. Alicia.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.352
Excuse me?

17:00.410 --> 17:04.699
_Eli said we move our
Investments to AIICIa.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.318
Wha... To...

17:06.370 --> 17:09.146
Wha... What did Eli say?

17:09.200 --> 17:10.974
Alicia divorces you,

17:11.030 --> 17:12.759
she runs for office,

17:12.810 --> 17:14.539
we invest in her.

17:14.590 --> 17:16.069
It's good.

17:16.120 --> 17:19.635
Especially when you look
at her approval ratings.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.992
I didn't know
he was teaching.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.689
JASON:
Guest lecturer.

17:26.740 --> 17:30.346
He looks like he's been
doing this his whole life.

17:30.390 --> 17:33.177
It's nice when people
find their purpose.

17:34.530 --> 17:37.875
Thank you
for helping with Peter.

17:39.180 --> 17:41.523
That's what I do.

17:43.190 --> 17:45.010
Lucca thinks...

17:46.800 --> 17:49.109
What does Lucca think?

17:49.150 --> 17:51.846
Lucca thinks
we should talk.

17:51.890 --> 17:53.198
About?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.719
Us.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.159
[sighs]

17:56.200 --> 17:58.191
God.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.411
I don't know.

18:01.900 --> 18:04.460
My head hurts every time
I try to figure out

18:04.510 --> 18:07.206
what it is you want
and what I want

18:07.260 --> 18:10.946
and how those two
things may coincide.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.639
No. Look...

18:13.700 --> 18:16.692
your husband needs you.

18:16.740 --> 18:19.300
I think sometimes you
need to be needed.

18:19.350 --> 18:21.784
It keeps you from
tipping over.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.578
[indistinct chatter]I j...

18:32.930 --> 18:35.148
Wait for me.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.269
Okay?

18:36.330 --> 18:38.628
Just wait.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.194
[indistinct chatter continues]

18:49.470 --> 18:52.553
Talk to Matan.JASON: Matan won't help.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.160
Why did they not do
a full search

18:55.220 --> 18:58.257
of the evidence room
for the missing bullets?

18:58.310 --> 19:00.778
Peter wouldn't sign off on it.

19:00.830 --> 19:02.957
No. After he left.

19:03.010 --> 19:05.433
[chuckles]:
What would be the point?
The bullets were gone.

19:05.490 --> 19:07.958
There's a metal detector right
outside the evidence room.

19:08.010 --> 19:10.831
I can't be the first person
to have noticed that.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.179
The missing bullets... are
still in there somewhere.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.401
Why did no one ever look
after the mistrial?

19:16.450 --> 19:19.271
What would be the point?

19:19.330 --> 19:21.321
The truth. Cary,
you always talk about the truth.

19:21.370 --> 19:24.021
Oh, come on. Your husband
caused that mistrial.

19:24.070 --> 19:25.412
That's the truth.
Seriously.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.371
So don't pretend
like you actually care

19:27.420 --> 19:28.762
about what really happened.

19:28.810 --> 19:31.370
Well, if Peter did it,
he did it.

19:31.430 --> 19:33.819
I want to know what happened
either way.

19:35.650 --> 19:39.086
A total search of
the evidence room is a dead end.

19:39.130 --> 19:41.564
It would take too long.There's
something else.

19:41.610 --> 19:45.819
There was a cell phone ringing
on the Patty Tanniston 911 call.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.223
We need your help, Cary.

with Patty?

Yes, that's correct.[chuckles]

19:59.020 --> 20:01.796

Do you think U.S. v. Nunez

Yeah. But_I left

21:33.070 --> 21:35.026
CONNOR:
Your Honor, please,
the defense is throwing

21:35.070 --> 21:36.981
every insane theory against
the wall to see what sticks.

21:37.030 --> 21:40.158
DIANE:
No. The police and prosecution
never pursued this witness,

21:40.210 --> 21:42.201
because they were
obsessed with Locke.
CONNOR:
But what does that matter?

21:42.250 --> 21:44.036
We are not trying
to solve a murder.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.775
This is not Murder on
the Orient Express.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.208
Yes, I love mysteries

21:47.260 --> 21:49.774
as much as the next person,
but this is confined.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.559
Did a politician do
something corrupt?Your Honor,

21:51.610 --> 21:53.919
ifI may be allowed to con...No. Hold on.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.473
[sighs]

21:55.530 --> 21:57.395
What did George Orwell say?

21:57.440 --> 22:01.786
"To see what is in front of your
nose needs a constant struggle."

22:01.840 --> 22:05.185
You're right, of course,
AUSA Fox.

22:05.230 --> 22:07.664
We've heard enough here.
The jury will be asked

22:07.710 --> 22:10.178
to continue their deliberations
without this testimony.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.141
DIANE:
Your Honor...No, I have made my ruling.

22:22.860 --> 22:25.021
Do you see
what's going on in court?

22:25.080 --> 22:26.206
Yeah. So?

22:26.250 --> 22:28.206
Do you think
we missed something?

22:28.250 --> 22:29.729
No.

22:29.780 --> 22:32.385
You think the bullets
are still in the evidence room?

22:33.430 --> 22:35.341
Probably.

22:37.610 --> 22:40.784
Remember how cops talked
about pitting evidence?

22:41.830 --> 22:43.559
Why you bringing that up?

22:43.620 --> 22:45.485
I'm not wearing
a wire, Matan.

22:45.530 --> 22:49.000
I'm just saying that cops used
to talk about pitting evidence.

22:49.060 --> 22:52.405
They'd "accidentally" drop the
evidence in a case just closed.

22:52.450 --> 22:55.408
With our bullets, that
would narrow down the search

22:55.460 --> 22:58.884
to a few hundred cases,
wouldn't it?

23:08.510 --> 23:09.374
One year.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.079
Probation?
No.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.463
One year
real jail time.
No.

23:15.170 --> 23:17.126
You know,

23:17.170 --> 23:19.126
I met you some years ago.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.126
At the Equal Justice Conference
in 2008.

23:22.180 --> 23:23.431
Do you remember?No.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.129
Your husband was
gIVIng a speech.

23:25.180 --> 23:27.785
This was before...
everything.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.569
You were fun.

23:29.620 --> 23:33.010
We, uh...
we-we talked about our kids.

23:33.060 --> 23:35.449
You, uh... [chuckles]
you made a joke

23:35.500 --> 23:37.661
about the terrible twos
and how they weren't as bad

23:37.720 --> 23:39.142
as the freakin' fours.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.454
That was a
long tIme ago.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.889
Yeah. Not many laughs now.

23:45.940 --> 23:48.465
Really?

23:48.510 --> 23:50.944
I don't make you laugh now?

23:50.990 --> 23:52.946
The wife of someone
you're prosecuting

23:52.990 --> 23:54.946
for corruption
doesn't amuse you?

23:54.990 --> 23:57.458
Okay. Thank you.Hey, here's
a thought.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.774
You give my husband one year
probation, no jail time,

24:00.830 --> 24:04.732
and I'll work up
a demure smile for you.

24:04.790 --> 24:06.735
How's this?

24:10.310 --> 24:12.870
Good-bye, Mrs. Florrick.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.219
[indistinct chatter]

24:16.280 --> 24:17.963
ELI:
Well, just tell them it's over.

24:18.020 --> 24:19.976
Yeah.

24:20.020 --> 24:21.749
I got to go.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.496
It's weird having you
across the street here.

24:27.550 --> 24:31.111
Yeah, well, Diane thought
it would be a good idea.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.116
Judge Cuesta
doesn't like me.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.980
I think it might
be working.

24:35.030 --> 24:37.032
It's going well.

24:38.470 --> 24:41.428
What are you doing, Eli?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.687
What am I doing? I'm...

24:43.740 --> 24:47.517
making sure
you're all right.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.744
Telling my donors
to give up on me?

24:51.830 --> 24:53.786
Excuse me?

24:53.840 --> 24:55.569
I talked to Dwight.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.576
He said you've been urging
the donors

24:57.620 --> 25:00.407
to move their interest
to Alicia.

25:00.450 --> 25:03.317
He looked at me
like I was a dead man,

25:03.370 --> 25:04.530
like I didn't exist.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.195
Do not patronize me.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.027
I am still the governor
of this state.Okay, I won't.

25:10.070 --> 25:12.413
This is a smart move.What is?

25:12.460 --> 25:13.984
Screwing me over?No, moving

25:14.030 --> 25:16.419
political assets over to Alicia.

25:16.470 --> 25:20.247
Even if you retain your
office, you are injured.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.723
The donors can't stick with
you. They can't be seen
within a mile of you.

25:22.780 --> 25:24.202
Because you're telling them
not to.

25:24.260 --> 25:26.216
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.No,

25:26.260 --> 25:29.479
it is not, Peter. Now, we
don't want their money to go

25:29.520 --> 25:32.694
to Rahm or Stratton or White.
We have to give them someone.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.219
Alicia?

25:34.270 --> 25:36.226
Yes.

25:36.270 --> 25:38.397
If I'm so tainted,

25:38.440 --> 25:40.704
why am I not tainting her?

25:40.750 --> 25:42.229
[grunts]

25:42.270 --> 25:44.409
Because she will divorce you.

25:44.450 --> 25:47.669
And it will be seen as
a move of Independence.

25:53.550 --> 25:55.973
Does Alicia know?

25:56.030 --> 25:59.193
Not yet.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.722
It's the smart
move, Peter.

26:05.780 --> 26:08.294
Yeah.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.511
I'm sorry.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.300
Yeah.

26:14.350 --> 26:16.568
[phone rings]

26:18.920 --> 26:20.876
Hi, Alicia.

26:20.920 --> 26:23.571
What?

26:24.620 --> 26:26.406
That's great news.
I'll see you soon.

26:29.670 --> 26:32.457
They found the bullets.

26:35.330 --> 26:37.935
They were discovered
by prosecutor, Matan
Brody, in another

26:37.980 --> 26:40.505
evidence box, Your Honor. They
were accidentally misplaced.

26:40.550 --> 26:41.630
This is so convenient.Well,

26:41.680 --> 26:43.591
it does seem oddly timed.
I mean,

26:43.640 --> 26:45.551
five years have gone by
and they haven't checked once?

26:45.600 --> 26:47.636
LUCCA:
They had no reason
to search thoroughly.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.078
This trial changed their mind.We're having
the bullets

26:49.120 --> 26:50.644
tested now, Your Honor.And you think

26:50.690 --> 26:52.646
the results should be given
to the jury?

26:52.690 --> 26:54.169
It supports
the defense's contention

26:54.220 --> 26:55.642
that Peter had no reason
to hide them.

26:55.700 --> 26:57.179
CONNOR:
When is this over,
Your Honor? I mean,

26:57.220 --> 26:58.471
at a certain point,
the jury has to work

26:58.520 --> 26:59.862
with the information given them.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.172
_ _ I don't know.
This IS a very unusual case.

27:02.220 --> 27:03.266
It is, Your Honor,
and we ask that...

27:03.310 --> 27:04.868
[phone buzzes]Oh.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.649
We had the bullet test
expedited, Your Honor.

27:06.710 --> 27:09.133
These should be the results now.

27:09.190 --> 27:11.146
Where are you?
Your office is crazy.

27:11.190 --> 27:14.318
Yes, We have an office space
crisis.

27:14.370 --> 27:17.100
Thanks for rushing the results,
Kurt. What did you find?

27:17.150 --> 27:19.323
It's definitive.

27:19.370 --> 27:22.100
Good. We'll need
you to testify.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.980
I'm not sure you'll want that.

27:24.030 --> 27:25.588
Why?

27:25.640 --> 27:28.200
The bullets came
from Locke's gun. He did it.

27:29.250 --> 27:31.298
You're sure?

27:31.340 --> 27:32.989
Yes.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.292
Florrick had reason to hide 'em.

27:45.570 --> 27:49.358
Okay, so we back
down on our motion

27:49.400 --> 27:51.391
without seeming
to back down.

27:51.450 --> 27:52.667
It doesn't mean

27:52.710 --> 27:54.018
that he's guilty.I don't know

27:54.060 --> 27:55.402
if I care anymore.

27:55.450 --> 27:56.929
He's your client.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.494
That's why you care.

28:00.670 --> 28:02.149
Was that the ballistics?

28:02.200 --> 28:03.451
Uh, no. I, um...

28:03.500 --> 28:05.491
Not yet.So I imagine

28:05.550 --> 28:09.111
you're still using
U.S. v. Nunezas precedent?

28:09.160 --> 28:10.502
I, um...

28:10.550 --> 28:12.461
Your Honor?As to why

28:12.510 --> 28:14.034
the bullet testing should
be given to the jury.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.331
LUCCA:
Yes, Your Honor.

28:15.380 --> 28:16.904
The jury had partial evidence.

28:16.950 --> 28:18.258
Now they will have
full evidence.

28:18.300 --> 28:20.552
How are we expecting
them to decide

28:20.610 --> 28:22.646
when they're missing the most
essential piece of our case?

28:22.700 --> 28:24.918
The bullet evidence.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.257
They jury

28:26.310 --> 28:27.914
must have access to the... what?

28:27.960 --> 28:30.485
...best available evidence.

28:30.530 --> 28:31.918
But they have
the full evidence now.

28:31.970 --> 28:33.528
The evidence isn't the testing.

28:33.580 --> 28:35.093
The evidence is Governor
Florrick's state of mind.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.449
Ms. Lockhart?

28:37.490 --> 28:38.445
Yes?

28:38.490 --> 28:41.050
Your argument.

28:41.110 --> 28:45.490
Well, we stand by
our original contention.

28:45.540 --> 28:46.325
Which was?

28:46.370 --> 28:48.497
What we originally said.

28:48.550 --> 28:52.509
All relevant evidence
is what we want.

28:52.550 --> 28:53.539
CUESTA:
Okay.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.023
Strong argument.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.332
What the hell was that?

28:58.380 --> 29:00.905
The bul|_ets worked
against us.

29:00.950 --> 29:02.383
Oh, damn.

29:18.010 --> 29:22.401
I heard about
the ballistics test.

29:22.450 --> 29:25.408
Just so you know,

29:25.450 --> 29:26.758
I didn't do it.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.802
It doesn't matter.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.499
The jury's deliberating anyway.

29:30.550 --> 29:32.541
It matters to me.

29:35.550 --> 29:36.630
Should I take the year?

29:40.300 --> 29:41.813
I don't know.

29:41.860 --> 29:45.990
I did eight months
and that was hard.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.645
But a whole year.

29:48.690 --> 29:51.215
Grace says she is
going to drop out of college

29:51.260 --> 29:52.693
to visit you in prison.

29:52.740 --> 29:54.173
[chuckling]:
What?

29:54.220 --> 29:55.824
I know.
We're talking.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.484
Ah.

29:57.530 --> 29:58.610
[phone buzzing]

30:02.580 --> 30:04.536
Court's back in session.

30:04.580 --> 30:06.059
HOLLY:
The original ballistic test

30:06.100 --> 30:09.536
on these spent bullets was a
pyrolysis gas chromatography.

30:09.590 --> 30:10.796
CONNOR:
And this was the test

30:10.850 --> 30:12.329
performed by Kurt McVeigh,
the expert hired

30:12.370 --> 30:13.849
by the SA's office?
HOLLY:
Yes.

30:13.890 --> 30:15.414
CONNOR:
And what test did you perform?

30:15.460 --> 30:16.711
An elemental composition test.

30:16.770 --> 30:18.249
He would've performed it, too,

30:18.290 --> 30:20.246
if the bullets hadn't been lost.

30:20.290 --> 30:21.848
CONNOR:
And did you perform
this test today?

30:21.900 --> 30:23.424
HOLLY:
I did.
And what did you find?

30:23.470 --> 30:25.244
[whispering]:
Hey, this is not good.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.460
The bullets definitely came
from Richard Locke's gun.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.589
Your Honor,

30:27.650 --> 30:28.776
I would agree with the defense.

30:28.820 --> 30:30.515
I think the jury
should have this evidence

30:30.560 --> 30:32.516
to aid in their deliberations.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.084
We have to get Kurt
to testify.

30:34.130 --> 30:35.301
No, he won't help us.

30:35.350 --> 30:37.045
If these results
get to the jury,

30:37.090 --> 30:39.046
they will find against Peter.

30:39.090 --> 30:40.432
CUESTA:
Hello, Ms. Lockhart.

30:40.490 --> 30:42.003
Do we have any questions
for this witness?

30:42.050 --> 30:43.301
Not at this time, Your Honor.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.227
We do have one other witness,
Your Honor.

30:46.270 --> 30:47.316
We call Kurt McVeigh.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.813
I had nothing to do
with him testifying!

31:05.860 --> 31:08.590
He's your husband, do you
know what that looks like?

31:08.640 --> 31:10.380
The jury didn't hear it.But they will hear it.

31:10.430 --> 31:11.681
Cuesta believed him.
He believed both of them.

31:11.730 --> 31:13.163
Can we just talk about...Then we argue about

31:13.210 --> 31:14.074
not entering that evidence.

31:14.130 --> 31:15.779
Or we undercut his testimony.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.036
We have nothing

31:17.090 --> 31:17.954
to undercut him with.There's a better way...

31:18.000 --> 31:19.433
He reversed himself!

31:19.480 --> 31:20.731
He reversed his testimony.
No.

31:20.790 --> 31:22.564
He only reversed himself
because I convinced him

31:22.610 --> 31:24.350
to testify in the first place.So?

31:24.400 --> 31:26.527
We can still_ use it.
We can still use

31:26.580 --> 31:28.616
the reversed testimony.
No!

31:31.840 --> 31:33.057
Because he's your husband?

31:33.100 --> 31:34.408
No.

31:34.450 --> 31:37.010
Because he's honest.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.971
He can't be undercut.

31:39.020 --> 31:42.626
Diane, you have a client.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.636
My husband.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.989
You have a duty to zealously
represent that client.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.804
And I am.

31:48.860 --> 31:52.421
I am, but to besmirch this
witness would backfire on us.

31:52.470 --> 31:55.860
I am not saying this
because he is my husband,

31:55.910 --> 31:58.686
I am saying this because it is
strategically a mistake.

31:58.740 --> 31:59.695
I disagree.

31:59.740 --> 32:01.389
Then have Peter fire me.

32:26.030 --> 32:27.281
I need your help.

32:27.330 --> 32:29.412
With what?

32:29.460 --> 32:31.894
Cross-examination.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.987
CUESTA:
Any questions, Ms. Lockhart?

32:35.040 --> 32:36.723
No, Your Honor.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.986
Yes, just a few.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.462
Mr. McVeigh,

32:39.520 --> 32:41.602
this is a change
in your attitude,

32:41.650 --> 32:42.958
this new ballistic test.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.217
McVEIGH:
No, not a change.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.512
A, uh...
it's a more refined test.

32:46.570 --> 32:48.390
But you testified
during the trial

32:48.440 --> 32:51.614
that yourballistic test
leaned toward the bullets

32:51.660 --> 32:53.002
not belonging to
Richard Locke's gun.

32:53.050 --> 32:54.358
Yes, I did.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.617
And now you have
a different opinion.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.355
Not a different opinion,

32:57.410 --> 32:59.355
a further scientific analysis.

32:59.410 --> 33:02.015
You're retired,
aren't you, Mr. McVeigh?

33:02.060 --> 33:04.016
Yes, I retired
this month.

33:04.060 --> 33:06.016
And yet you did
this ballistic test

33:06.070 --> 33:08.538
just a few hours ago?

33:08.590 --> 33:10.842
Yes, I did. As a favor.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.539
And you checked your findings
with the prosecutor's

33:13.600 --> 33:15.591
ballistics expert,
Holly Westfall?

33:15.640 --> 33:16.948
McVEIGH:
I did.

33:16.990 --> 33:18.685
LUCCA:
Why did you do that?

33:18.730 --> 33:22.200
I wanted to see if she
had the same result.

33:22.260 --> 33:25.900
Is this standard
operating procedure?

33:25.960 --> 33:27.905
No.

33:27.960 --> 33:31.043
Why did you
do it, then?

33:31.090 --> 33:33.911
This was an unusual case.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.043
And we had
a differing opinion in 2012.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.522
And isn't it true
that you've

33:38.580 --> 33:39.615
given her your business?

33:39.660 --> 33:41.059
McVEIGH:
I've sold her my business.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.579
That's true.And isn't it true

33:42.620 --> 33:44.144
that you have had an affair
with Holly Westfall?

33:44.190 --> 33:45.839
CONNOR:
Objection, Your Honor.

33:45.890 --> 33:47.846
For the life of me, I can't
figure out the relevance here.

33:47.890 --> 33:49.846
LUCCA:
The relevance is that
Mr. McVeigh has changed

33:49.890 --> 33:52.893
his testimony to align with
the prosecutor's expert.

33:52.940 --> 33:54.760
_ Bias from an affair
is completely relevant.

33:54.810 --> 33:56.675
CONNOR:
This is more melodrama,
Your Honor.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.413
The defense is having trouble
sticking to the facts.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.984
CUESTA:
Again, I am a jury of one here.

34:01.030 --> 34:03.590
I will allow some leeway
in questioning

34:03.650 --> 34:05.254
then rule on the relevance
for the jury.

34:05.300 --> 34:07.074
You may proceed.

34:07.130 --> 34:09.473
LUCCA:
Isn't it true, Mr. McVeigh,
that you have had

34:09.520 --> 34:11.124
an affair
with Holly Westfall?

34:11.170 --> 34:12.478
And isn't that
the reason that

34:12.520 --> 34:14.522
you've changed your testimony?

34:38.680 --> 34:40.898
WILL:
What is the point?

34:40.940 --> 34:42.202
What?

34:42.250 --> 34:43.854
What is the point of all this?

34:43.900 --> 34:46.039
To zealously represent
our clients.Right.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.468
Diane knows it
better than anyone.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.646
And the ethics of it?

34:48.690 --> 34:50.863
Hey, ethics change.

34:50.910 --> 34:52.775
We're all adults here.

34:54.090 --> 34:55.216
Things used to be simpler.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.739
No.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.826
Things were never simple.

34:58.870 --> 35:00.826
CONNOR:
Well, that was effective.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.529
CONNOR:
So the jury doesn't get
the new ballistics test.

35:02.570 --> 35:04.834
It was all for naught.

35:04.880 --> 35:07.223
Yup.
You have an offer?

35:09.450 --> 35:11.099
One year.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.629
No.Probation.

35:12.670 --> 35:15.491
One year probation.
No jail time.

35:15.540 --> 35:17.326
The governor resigns
from his governorship.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.068
We could wait for a verdict.

35:20.110 --> 35:23.022
Yes, you could.

35:23.070 --> 35:25.026
But Peter won't want that.

35:25.070 --> 35:27.026
Why?

35:27.080 --> 35:29.071
He's guilty.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.389
We'll consider it.

35:33.430 --> 35:36.297
Do.

35:36.350 --> 35:38.341
He won't get better.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.874
PETER:
What do you think?

35:46.920 --> 35:48.831
It's up to you.

35:50.580 --> 35:51.877
But what do you think?

35:51.930 --> 35:53.659
I would take it.

35:53.710 --> 35:57.441
It's amazing
we've come this far.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.014
This jury
is unpredictable.

36:00.070 --> 36:04.154
You take the plea,
you don't spend one day in jail.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.332
My career will be over.

36:10.990 --> 36:13.299
I think it's over anyway,
isn't it?

36:24.090 --> 36:25.523
What are you gonna do?

36:29.970 --> 36:31.961
I'm gonna take the deal.

36:34.140 --> 36:37.098
But I need one more favor.

36:37.150 --> 36:39.971
I'll announce tomorrow.

36:40.020 --> 36:42.193
Stand by my side.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.191
Sure.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.301
What do I do now?

37:10.050 --> 37:11.654
Go to him.

37:11.700 --> 37:13.691
You're done
with Peter.

37:13.750 --> 37:16.310
Like a fever,
it's over.

37:18.060 --> 37:20.278
Jason's not you.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.016
Hmm. Very few
people are me.

37:23.060 --> 37:24.664
[chuckles softly]

37:27.330 --> 37:28.888
He's a boy.

37:28.940 --> 37:31.101
He likes boy things.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.843
You like boy things.No, I don't.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.117
What makes you say that?God, you have

37:34.160 --> 37:36.116
so little self-awareness.

37:38.730 --> 37:40.379
What if I'm unhappy with him?

37:40.430 --> 37:42.898
Blame me.
Seriously,

37:42.950 --> 37:45.202
do you want to live here alone?

37:45.260 --> 37:48.252
Look at this place.
It'll drive you crazy.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.044
You're right.

37:52.090 --> 37:54.081
Then go to him.
It's not too late.

38:14.110 --> 38:16.101
I'll love you forever.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.241
I'm okay with that.

38:35.220 --> 38:37.211
[indistinct conversations]

38:48.360 --> 38:49.702
Hey, where's Jason?

38:49.760 --> 38:51.148
Gone. Why?

38:51.190 --> 38:52.452
Where?

38:52.500 --> 38:53.626
I don't know.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.282
I tried his cell.
No luck.

38:58.980 --> 39:02.370
Hey, Jason.
Where are you?

39:02.420 --> 39:05.071
I need to talk. I...

39:07.210 --> 39:09.075
It's over.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.860
Peter's taking the plea.

39:10.910 --> 39:12.389
My daughter is going to school,

39:12.430 --> 39:14.386
and I...

39:14.430 --> 39:16.694
I need to see you.

39:16.740 --> 39:18.731
Call me back, please.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.122
[camera shutters clicking]

40:00.180 --> 40:02.171
[overlapping shouting]

40:05.790 --> 40:08.042
[camera shutters clicking]

40:08.100 --> 40:10.045
Good afternoon.

40:10.100 --> 40:12.443
As of 3:30 today, I informed
the lieutenant governor

40:12.490 --> 40:14.094
that I am resigning the office

40:14.150 --> 40:17.108
of governor of Illinois.

40:17.150 --> 40:19.311
Though I have
been cleared

40:19.370 --> 40:21.930
of all_ but one
corruption charge,

40:21.980 --> 40:24.062
I wish to spare the
people of Illinois

40:24.110 --> 40:26.283
any further expense

40:26.330 --> 40:27.979
or frustration.

40:28.030 --> 40:30.669
My wife and I would like
to thank all the people

40:30.730 --> 40:33.335
who have supported us
over the years.

40:33.380 --> 40:35.689
As you can
imagine,

40:35.730 --> 40:39.552
this has been a
difficult time.

40:41.220 --> 40:43.211
I do want to thank
my legal team.

40:46.260 --> 40:48.216
Diane Lockhart. Thank you.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.397
Thank you
very much.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.749
I want to thank my children,

40:52.790 --> 40:54.485
and all my friends

40:54.530 --> 40:56.669
who have stood by us.

40:56.710 --> 41:00.237
And I especially want
to thank my wife, Alicia.

41:02.020 --> 41:03.453
I couldn't have
done this without you.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.018
Thank you all very much.

41:07.070 --> 41:10.983
If I kiss you
where it's sore

41:11.030 --> 41:14.636
IfI kiss you where
it's sore

41:14.680 --> 41:16.989
Will you feel better

41:17.030 --> 41:19.248
Better, better

41:19.300 --> 41:21.905
Jason? Will you feel anything

41:21.950 --> 41:22.996
At_a_ll?
AllCla.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.519
Will you feel better

41:24.560 --> 41:25.777
Jason.

41:25.830 --> 41:27.513
Better, better

41:27.570 --> 41:30.733
Will you feel anything

41:30.790 --> 41:32.178
At all?

41:36.100 --> 41:39.479
Born like sisters
to this world

41:39.540 --> 41:42.919
In a town where blood ties
are only blood

41:43.970 --> 41:46.109
Diane?

41:46.150 --> 41:48.277
Say your name out loud
to anyone

41:48.330 --> 41:52.107
They can never
ever call you by it

41:52.160 --> 41:56.460
If I kiss you
where it's sore

41:56.510 --> 41:59.593
IfI kiss you where
it's sore

41:59.640 --> 42:02.461
Will you feel better

42:02.520 --> 42:04.078
Better, better

42:04.130 --> 42:06.906
Will you feel anything

42:06.950 --> 42:08.292
At all?

42:08.350 --> 42:11.126
Will you feel better

42:11.180 --> 42:13.125
Better, better

42:13.180 --> 42:15.136
Will you feel anything

42:15.180 --> 42:17.136
At all?

42:17.180 --> 42:22.186
Will you feel anything
at all?

42:22.230 --> 42:26.018
Feel anything at all?

42:27.280 --> 42:31.068
Anything at all?

42:32.110 --> 42:35.159
Anything at all?
