00:17.600 --> 00:20.080
-Alprazolam.
-Do you have a prescription?

00:28.520 --> 00:29.960
This is a year old, sir.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.000
Why are you staring at me?

00:35.240 --> 00:37.040
Do you want to lose your license?

00:37.920 --> 00:39.760
You sell ice cream in a pharmacy?

00:46.920 --> 00:49.280
Hey, get out of here!

01:32.560 --> 01:35.400
<i>As the drought situation worsens,</i>

01:35.480 --> 01:36.960
<i>so does the suicide rate among farmers.</i>

01:37.040 --> 01:39.720
<i>There have been droughts</i>
<i>all over the country,</i>

01:39.800 --> 01:43.760
<i>and Maharashtra is the most affected...</i>

01:43.960 --> 01:46.400
<i>When a man is broken on the inside,</i>

01:46.480 --> 01:49.640
<i>nothing can convince the world</i>
<i>that he still has strength.</i>

01:53.880 --> 01:56.640
<i>After Isa took Kukoo away from me</i>
<i>and killed Paritosh,</i>

01:56.720 --> 01:58.920
<i>I became impotent.</i>

02:05.040 --> 02:06.000
Do it properly.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.320
Bitch.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.000
<i>But I couldn't stop thinking about</i>
<i>the mole in the gang.</i>

02:17.800 --> 02:20.960
<i>Who told Isa that Paritosh would be</i>
<i>coming to the wedding alone?</i>

02:36.560 --> 02:37.480
Close your eyes.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.440
Turn around.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.160
I won't be a whore.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.920
You've been out drinking.
How will you be able to do it?

03:00.320 --> 03:01.840
You don't know anything.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.080
I know everything.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.480
Ever since Mr. Paritosh died,
you've been lost.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.040
Bombay is suffering and so are you.

03:12.720 --> 03:16.800
Until you get your revenge,
you won't be able to do anything.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.000
Katekar.

04:09.720 --> 04:10.920
Look at this report.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.040
-Whose is it?
-That same woman.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.120
-Man, I've seen this.
-Check it again.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.720
It's nothing.
She comes here and bothers me every day.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.440
-Are you mad?
-Leave it.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.480
You can't do this.
There's been a theft in the neighborhood.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.400
-Are you aware of it?
-So?

04:32.520 --> 04:35.000
"So"? That old woman is in the hospital.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.920
They're looking for three boys.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.800
Katekar, we'll be fucked.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.760
Take a look at it.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.080
Check it. I'll come back.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.080
Give that back. There are only two left.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.760
Hey, Bengali Bura's celebrity.
What are you looking at?

05:10.840 --> 05:13.520
-What happened, sir?
-I'll pluck your eyes out. Motherfucker.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.240
If he's not sent to jail...

05:23.800 --> 05:25.200
Fuck me.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.360
Sir.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.080
-How long has your son been missing?
-Ten days, sir.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.400
Who did he hang out with?

05:36.040 --> 05:38.800
Bazil and Faraj.
They live in the neighborhood.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.800
I warned him about those boys.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.920
Look at you, Mother Teresa! Your son's a saint, isn't he?

05:49.280 --> 05:51.040
He's been missing for ten days, right?

05:52.200 --> 05:55.240
Exactly ten days ago,
there was a theft in the neighborhood.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.840
Three boys were involved in it.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.880
They attacked an old couple,
robbed them and ran away.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.480
Your son and his friends
have been missing since then.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.880
Not my son, sir.

06:04.960 --> 06:09.280
Holy shit, this place is so big.
It's a duplex!

06:09.360 --> 06:11.760
Where did the money come from?

06:12.840 --> 06:15.000
I'm Katekar and my house is small.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.680
About half this size.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.680
-He used to work, sir.
-Yeah, right.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.960
He took a computer course.

06:22.040 --> 06:22.880
Look at this.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.640
Sure, a "computer course."

06:28.080 --> 06:29.720
-Yes.
-Take a look, sir.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.320
Let me see which course your son took.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.320
Yes, sir.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.560
He had to get away from here, sir.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.800
From Bengali Bura.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.680
-How are you here all of a sudden?
-I couldn't sleep at home.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.960
-God bless you.
-I thought I could sleep here.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.120
Here, have some, dear.

07:24.480 --> 07:28.160
If Megha was still with you,
you'd be happy.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.800
Home isn't something you leave behind,

07:34.280 --> 07:37.040
it's what you come back to in the evening.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.000
Mom, do you remember my bat?
The cricket bat?

07:42.560 --> 07:45.840
That enemy of mine?
The one that I oiled every day?

07:45.920 --> 07:47.640
Where did Dad get it from?

07:48.480 --> 07:49.880
What do you mean?

07:50.680 --> 07:51.880
It was imported.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.200
Yes.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.720
Dad couldn't afford such an expensive bat.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.080
Are you here to pay your respects
or to investigate him?

08:02.480 --> 08:05.800
Gaitonde mentioned Dad... before he died.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.640
Gaitonde can say whatever he wants.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.120
Neither of us got any sleep in this house.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.720
But your dad always slept peacefully,

08:16.800 --> 08:18.880
because he never did anything wrong.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.640
If Jojo had the file,
we would have found it by now.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.360
We've looked everywhere.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.040
What happened?

08:50.440 --> 08:51.400
What happened?

08:53.520 --> 08:56.920
Oh, this? A kickboxing accident.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.120
You expect me to believe
that's from kickboxing?

09:05.840 --> 09:07.600
Tell me the truth. What happened?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.360
Hey, Zoya...

09:18.920 --> 09:20.200
What can I tell you?

09:25.800 --> 09:27.040
Did he hit you?

09:32.120 --> 09:33.160
So sue him.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.800
That won't help.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.640
He killed two people while driving drunk.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.040
He got away with it.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.120
What else has he done?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.280
My love. My child.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.440
Cookie.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.800
He threw him off the balcony.

10:09.880 --> 10:10.840
Your child?

10:19.920 --> 10:20.920
Was he high?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.040
Yes, but not on alcohol.

10:24.680 --> 10:25.680
What do you mean?

10:34.760 --> 10:38.080
He'd butter his morning toast with it
if he could.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.840
He probably does.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.240
We'll take care of him. Don't worry.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.200
Why don't you come stay with me?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.600
Don't you feel lonely?

11:07.280 --> 11:09.560
It reminds me of our home in Lahore.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.960
Isn't that something you want to forget?

11:14.920 --> 11:17.560
This was our first home
after the Partition.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.120
Your father used up his savings
to build this house.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.440
How can I leave it?

11:35.080 --> 11:37.040
Don't worry about me, Sartaj.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.600
Do your work with honesty.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.440
Your heart will feel lighter.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.480
MAJID ALI KHAN - POLICE INSPECTOR
SARTAJ SINGH - POLICE INSPECTOR

12:07.440 --> 12:09.680
Fuck me, I've given you so much.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.400
Long live India, sir.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.160
We don't get to eat anything,
but at least you do.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.000
Eat what you get.
A cop is telling you... eat.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.560
Sir! How's your mom?

12:23.640 --> 12:25.040
She was asking about you.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.480
Come on, sir!

12:27.600 --> 12:28.720
-Listen.
-Yes.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.280
Yes, sir?

12:33.200 --> 12:35.840
Tickets for Home Minister Bhonsle's
charity show.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.200
Zoya Mirza will be performing.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.680
Take Shalini and the kids.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.160
Hello.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.360
Where?

13:06.440 --> 13:11.240
The biggest player who transfers
fake currency into Asia is Shanky Purohit.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.520
No one dares to mess with him.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.120
Next one?

14:37.560 --> 14:40.440
Shamsul! Shamsul!

14:51.560 --> 14:52.760
We're both failures. You didn't do your duty...

14:58.760 --> 14:59.880
and I didn't do mine.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.360
We curse the system...

15:06.560 --> 15:08.840
say there's no place in it
for an honest officer.

15:08.960 --> 15:12.000
There's no place for an honest man
in this city, in this country.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.760
But who makes the system?

15:15.800 --> 15:17.680
Who makes Mumbai? Who makes India?

15:19.560 --> 15:20.880
It's us, motherfucker.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.920
-Hey. Where's Deva?
-Over there.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.600
Do it right.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.280
Boy! Get on it.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.760
Get out.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.360
Quickly.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.000
Have a seat.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.160
Shamsul Rehman.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.440
He was involved in a robbery
with two other boys in Diamond Society.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.120
I've heard, sir.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.560
His body was found in the gutter.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.920
The other two boys are missing.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.920
I don't know where these boys went
or where they are now.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.680
Motherfucker, did I ask you?

16:24.680 --> 16:26.520
Did I ask you?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.840
The little boys who work here,

16:31.240 --> 16:32.880
where did you buy them?

16:32.960 --> 16:35.600
How old are they?
How much do you pay them?

16:36.160 --> 16:38.640
I'll send you to prison
for using child laborers.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.440
Did I say anything like that?

16:44.240 --> 16:45.240
Fucker!

16:49.680 --> 16:50.920
These boys...

16:53.240 --> 16:56.680
These boys can't run a gang.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.280
They have a boss here.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.000
No!

17:06.080 --> 17:07.760
Fucker! Piece of shit!

17:07.840 --> 17:09.720
Give me some water.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.280
Motherfucker.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.079
Did those boys from Bengali Bura
work for you?

17:19.200 --> 17:23.720
Did they, asshole? Say it, motherfucker!

17:24.480 --> 17:25.320
Water...

17:25.400 --> 17:26.680
Do you want water?

17:27.200 --> 17:30.560
You want water?

17:31.120 --> 17:35.000
Here, take it. Drink. Drink some water.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.400
I'm a Maharashtrian.

17:37.960 --> 17:42.960
I'll break your skull open.
Say it! Say it, motherfucker!

17:43.480 --> 17:44.400
Say it!

17:46.600 --> 17:47.560
Listen...

17:48.480 --> 17:51.360
I'll cut you up and eat you for breakfast.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.840
Say it.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.160
Dad.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.560
Dad.

18:30.760 --> 18:31.800
Dad.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.240
What happened to you?

18:54.760 --> 18:57.560
Today, after a long time,
I behaved like a real cop.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.280
Did you beat someone?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.640
To get the truth out of him.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.160
How do I look?

19:12.160 --> 19:13.680
Zoya is no match for you.

19:13.760 --> 19:14.720
Mom?

20:21.160 --> 20:22.040
Mr. Parulkar?

20:22.600 --> 20:26.600
To ease the suffering...

20:28.360 --> 20:30.240
caused by the drought in Maharashtra...

20:31.240 --> 20:35.160
the government is dispatching
more than a thousand water tankers

20:35.920 --> 20:41.200
to the most affected areas.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.120
I would like to thank...

20:45.160 --> 20:48.000
the organizations that have helped

20:48.400 --> 20:52.080
the government in this undertaking.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.840
In this endeavor of ours,

20:55.400 --> 20:58.360
a renowned actress
has joined hands with us,

20:58.960 --> 21:02.200
our beloved Miss Zoya,

21:02.280 --> 21:03.440
Zoya Mirza.

21:05.200 --> 21:09.360
Now, without keeping
Miss Zoya from you any longer,

21:09.440 --> 21:10.560
I shall say good night.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.600
Long live India. Long live Maharashtra.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.840
-So, Katekar...
-Yes?

22:56.120 --> 22:58.160
...why did you abandon Zoya?

22:59.200 --> 23:00.200
Shut up.

23:00.760 --> 23:01.960
Tell me.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.200
Did you know, sir?

23:03.640 --> 23:06.320
In his wallet, neatly tucked under
his wife's photo is a photo of Zoya Mirza.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.680
Shut up.

23:08.440 --> 23:12.440
No, sir, I'm over all that now.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.000
Why are you laughing? Come.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.680
Surprise!

23:40.680 --> 23:44.520
Your mom in Bengali Bura has called you
to have some dessert. Who's Faraj?

23:45.520 --> 23:47.240
-Speak up.
-Who's Faraj?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.960
Sir, I'm Faraj. What happened?

23:50.040 --> 23:53.000
Your mom had a baby. Fuck me.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.400
And you?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.880
-Bazil.
-You're Faraj, you're Bazil.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.360
And you? Fazil?

24:00.160 --> 24:02.040
Are you old enough to drink?

24:02.120 --> 24:05.000
Why are you asking him?
He's just grown his balls.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.680
Have they dropped?

24:07.640 --> 24:11.840
Do they have soft hair? Do you vote?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.880
-Do you vote?
-No, sir.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.560
You don't vote, but you drink alcohol?

24:20.160 --> 24:21.160
Where is Shamsul?

24:22.720 --> 24:23.760
Where is Shamsul?

24:23.840 --> 24:25.960
-I don't know any Shamsul.
-No?

24:28.840 --> 24:29.720
Shamsul?

24:30.840 --> 24:32.280
You're not Shamsul.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.360
Where is Shamsul?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.360
You're not Shamshul. Did you kill him?

24:40.240 --> 24:41.520
Speak, asshole.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.720
Katekar! Call an ambulance!

24:52.280 --> 24:53.640
Call an ambulance!

24:56.240 --> 24:58.600
Katekar. Kat...

25:06.040 --> 25:06.920
Katekar!

27:21.720 --> 27:23.600
It was Isa's niece's wedding.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.040
In Dubai.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.960
He spent 12 crores.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.440
Check out the glitz.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.680
The entire film industry was there.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.000
One of yours was there, too.

27:44.640 --> 27:45.480
See?

27:57.800 --> 27:58.800
I owe you.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.840
Look for Bunty.
Bring him to the factory tomorrow.

28:34.600 --> 28:35.440
Boss.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.800
I picked you up off the streets.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.400
I gave you everything.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.080
I never treated you unfairly.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.840
And yet you're planning to kill me.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.520
-Me, boss?
-I'm not talking to you.

29:11.520 --> 29:15.560
I saw your video with Isa. In Dubai.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.800
You wanted him in the gang, right?

29:26.720 --> 29:29.400
Did you ever wonder how many Muslims
would survive in Gopalmath

29:29.800 --> 29:31.320
after he came here?

29:32.880 --> 29:35.320
I think about it every day.
That's why you're alive.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.760
I think about it every day
because you're like my brother.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.600
But you made me the bad guy
in all of this.

29:48.760 --> 29:49.760
What now, asshole?

29:53.400 --> 29:54.840
Are you happy now?

30:00.160 --> 30:01.320
Whatever I have done...

30:03.320 --> 30:04.760
it's on me, okay?

30:05.320 --> 30:09.280
All this shit I've done... it's on me.

30:10.240 --> 30:13.240
Chotta had no idea about any of this.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.520
He respects you.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.280
Don't harm him.
He wasn't involved in this.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.120
He wasn't. Don't do anything to him, okay?

30:23.400 --> 30:26.680
I did all of it. I did it.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.520
Please forgive Chotta.

30:46.800 --> 30:47.880
He'll be forgiven.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.160
-This time, the queen will fall.
-Tea?

31:17.280 --> 31:19.600
-The queen will fall last.
-No? Are you sure?

31:19.680 --> 31:22.520
You don't need anything, right? Here.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.160
Take it away.

31:25.920 --> 31:29.000
-You don't want any?
-Not now, the game is too interesting.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.400
Hi, boss.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.440
Boss, you look stressed.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.520
It's your turn now.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.240
Bada planned Mr. Paritosh's murder
with Isa.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.560
What shit are you talking about?

32:11.640 --> 32:14.240
I'm not talking shit.
I'm telling you the truth.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.720
You think he went to Dubai to shop?

32:18.400 --> 32:20.360
He was dancing at Isa's niece's wedding.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.800
He was the one who plotted
Mr. Paritosh's murder.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.880
My brother planned Paritosh's murder
with Isa?

32:26.960 --> 32:30.520
Am I speaking another language?
I can show you the video.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.120
Do you want to come see it,
or should I bring it here?

32:33.200 --> 32:35.680
I couldn't leave the fucking house,
thinking it was my fault.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.880
-Boss, what is he saying?
-What am I saying?

32:37.960 --> 32:40.000
-I don't believe him. He's lying.
-Ask him!

32:40.080 --> 32:42.040
-Because of him I couldn't leave--
-I would never--

33:32.240 --> 33:33.520
You're full of sadness.

33:35.120 --> 33:35.960
Why?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.960
If a traitor has to die, he has to die.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.600
Mr. Sartaj is here.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.160
What is this?

35:11.840 --> 35:13.480
He left with you, didn't he?

35:14.960 --> 35:17.280
He was walking, wasn't he?

35:25.600 --> 35:28.280
What will I tell my sons?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.840
He's not waking up.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.600
Tell you what...

35:39.360 --> 35:42.440
call him from your phone.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.880
No matter how deep his sleep was...

35:47.760 --> 35:49.800
he always woke up and answered your call.

35:49.880 --> 35:53.320
Just one call, maybe he'll wake up.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.080
Just one call.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.200
Katekar.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.400
Katekar.

36:33.680 --> 36:34.680
Love live India, sir.

36:37.080 --> 36:39.120
We killed the other two right there.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.400
Both the fuckers are dead.

37:12.040 --> 37:14.320
SARTAJ SINGH - POLICE INSPECTOR

37:19.920 --> 37:21.360
<i>What do they think?</i>

37:21.440 --> 37:22.320
What?

37:23.400 --> 37:26.080
If you clean the beach every day,
will it become clean?

37:26.360 --> 37:28.000
Ideally, it should be, sir. Where does this trash come from?

37:34.040 --> 37:35.080
Clean it today...

37:36.440 --> 37:39.320
tomorrow the sea
will bring in a thousand times more.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.520
We stop crime every day,
go home at night...

37:45.360 --> 37:47.040
and come back
to the same thing the next morning.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.600
But, sir, it's clean today.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.480
Isn't it?

37:52.240 --> 37:53.080
Right?

37:54.880 --> 38:00.280
It's a lovely place
to enjoy the breeze and have a picnic.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.400
We can just lay a mat here
and relax with the family.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.520
That's a lot. It's enough. We'll deal with it tomorrow when it comes.

38:12.120 --> 38:17.120
Look over there. My loving wife and sons.
Hey! Holy shit.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.680
Come here!

38:32.600 --> 38:33.920
Do you want a vada pav?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.360
Guards, attention!

38:50.240 --> 38:53.960
Guards, ready the guns!

38:56.280 --> 38:57.480
In position!

39:02.480 --> 39:03.600
Reload!

39:05.680 --> 39:06.920
In position!

39:11.120 --> 39:13.760
Empty the guns!

39:16.360 --> 39:19.480
Guards, turn!

40:32.400 --> 40:35.920
<i>Ma'am, this is Dr. Ghadge</i>
<i>from Kohinoor Hospital, Mumbai.</i>

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Yes, what is it?

40:38.200 --> 40:42.880
<i>The full toxicology report</i>
<i>for the patient you admitted has arrived.</i>

40:47.200 --> 40:49.080
<i>It was injected through the IV drip.</i>

40:56.680 --> 40:58.840
I want the CCTV footage
of all the corridor entries

40:58.920 --> 41:00.400
and exits from that night.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.320
<i>Now?</i> <i>All right.</i>

43:37.600 --> 43:40.160
Holy shit, Katekar.

43:48.840 --> 43:50.560
"I'll sort everything out."

43:54.800 --> 43:55.720
Fucker!
