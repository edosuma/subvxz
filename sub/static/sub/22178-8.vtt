WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:02.570
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:03.879 --> 00:05.109
I've been looking for you

00:05.134 --> 00:07.346
for... for a long, long time, Eloise.

00:07.416 --> 00:09.383
You have no idea

00:09.451 --> 00:12.362
what you just let crawl
out into this world.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.885
Custody was given to
Ms. Belfrey for a reason.

00:14.996 --> 00:16.438
Until we can review the case,

00:16.463 --> 00:17.874
Lucy needs to come with us.

00:17.943 --> 00:19.008
Into the system?

00:19.077 --> 00:19.876
Maybe we can help.

00:19.945 --> 00:21.177
Henry.

00:21.246 --> 00:22.312
You look surprised to see me.

00:22.380 --> 00:23.753
Didn't you want me to find you?

00:25.183 --> 00:27.317
You said you don't believe in signs.

00:35.147 --> 00:36.711
Keep up, Mills.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.363
I thought you were taught by a pirate.

00:40.432 --> 00:43.207
Yeah... one who doesn't
cheat half as much as you do.

00:43.232 --> 00:44.167
Hey!

00:49.441 --> 00:51.755
You think the King's
soldiers won't fight dirty?

00:56.198 --> 00:58.147
Got you.

00:58.216 --> 01:00.049
I guess I got a little too ambitious.

01:00.118 --> 01:03.319
Hey, no risk, no reward.

01:07.292 --> 01:08.658
Oh. Uh...

01:08.727 --> 01:10.493
- Henry, I'm sorry.
- No, no. I'm... I'm sorry.

01:10.562 --> 01:11.761
I'm sorry.

01:11.830 --> 01:15.054
It's just complicated.

01:15.079 --> 01:16.402
Complicated how?

01:16.427 --> 01:17.460
Shh.

01:19.430 --> 01:21.358
There's someone here.

01:26.278 --> 01:27.410
Alice?

01:27.475 --> 01:29.012
Henry Mills.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.980
I thought I warned you to go home.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.649
Yeah, well, I tend not to trust people

01:32.717 --> 01:34.621
who drug me and tie me up.

01:35.058 --> 01:37.996
Ella, this is Alice from Wonderland.

01:38.334 --> 01:40.367
And other places.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.624
You've been to Wonderland?

01:41.693 --> 01:43.949
Yep. Been there, done that.

01:44.019 --> 01:45.395
I need to find someone.

01:45.924 --> 01:47.491
I think you might know where he is.

01:49.363 --> 01:51.901
This tower that you went to,

01:52.118 --> 01:54.085
you said it was in ruins?

01:55.530 --> 01:57.730
The place was completely destroyed.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.044
Papa?

02:06.587 --> 02:07.984
Alice?

02:09.821 --> 02:11.020
Alice, is it really you?

02:11.089 --> 02:12.522
Yes, yes, it's me.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.304
But is it really you?

02:15.329 --> 02:17.527
You're... you're so young.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.162
It was magic. I just...

02:21.266 --> 02:22.332
Alice, what... what happened?

02:22.400 --> 02:25.034
How did you, uh...

02:25.103 --> 02:27.203
How did you escape the tower without me.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.771
Well, it's a long story, Papa, but...

02:29.160 --> 02:30.760
Well, I'm here now.

02:31.653 --> 02:33.954
No, no, no. Don't.

02:33.979 --> 02:35.411
You know my heart is poisoned.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.619
- You can't come near me.
- No, it's okay.

02:37.644 --> 02:39.649
I... I found a cure.

02:39.991 --> 02:41.290
I've been shielded.

02:42.582 --> 02:44.053
A cure?

02:44.371 --> 02:46.238
Yes, Papa.

02:46.395 --> 02:48.441
I've missed you so much.

02:51.373 --> 02:52.639
Papa, no!

02:52.664 --> 02:54.063
Hook?

02:55.367 --> 02:56.499
Aah!

02:57.424 --> 02:58.389
Hook!

02:58.414 --> 02:59.635
This isn't supposed to happen!

02:59.704 --> 03:00.837
We're cured!

03:02.839 --> 03:04.240
Wait, Alice, no! Wait!

03:04.309 --> 03:06.855
Go after her. I'll take care of Hook.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:21.438 --> 03:22.842
We lost her.

03:23.502 --> 03:24.835
No, we didn't.

03:24.860 --> 03:26.462
Ella, we have no idea where that leads.

03:26.835 --> 03:28.664
Sure, we do...

03:28.733 --> 03:30.533
Wonderland.

03:30.602 --> 03:32.902
No risk, no reward, right?

03:32.971 --> 03:34.137
Ella!

03:57.838 --> 03:59.461
Please don't go.

03:59.905 --> 04:02.406
This place is awful. I hate it.

04:02.726 --> 04:04.901
Grandma's in jail.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.112
Why can't I be with you?

04:07.137 --> 04:08.503
It's complicated, Luce,

04:08.528 --> 04:10.878
but I'm... I'm figuring it out, okay?

04:10.903 --> 04:12.408
I know.

04:12.477 --> 04:14.310
I know.

04:15.051 --> 04:16.483
Go.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.457
It'll be okay, Jay.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.431
How am I supposed to get Lucy back?

04:29.456 --> 04:30.827
Well, you could do it the American way

04:30.895 --> 04:32.261
and hire a lawyer.

04:32.330 --> 04:33.296
Right.

04:33.364 --> 04:34.831
Like I can afford a lawyer.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.567
Well, I did a little light
social-media stalking,

04:37.635 --> 04:41.471
and, uh, you know who
graduated from law school?

04:41.745 --> 04:43.392
No. Unh-unh.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.373
Absolutely not.

04:44.442 --> 04:45.575
It's too risky.

04:46.065 --> 04:48.241
He'll probably make
everything worse anyway.

04:48.266 --> 04:49.491
It was kind of his M.O., remember?

04:49.516 --> 04:50.980
You just told Lucy you
would do everything,

04:51.049 --> 04:52.381
so do everything.

04:52.450 --> 04:54.217
Isn't Lucy worth the risk?

04:56.754 --> 05:00.990
I mean, I knew everything
about my mother, but...

05:01.059 --> 05:02.925
how could I have not known

05:02.994 --> 05:06.529
that she kidnapped poor Eloise Gardener?

05:07.532 --> 05:09.449
Perfect. That was great, Ivy.

05:09.474 --> 05:10.766
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:10.835 --> 05:12.802
Yeah, thank you so much
for doing this interview.

05:12.871 --> 05:15.798
I mean, I know it can't be easy

05:15.823 --> 05:17.565
to talk about what happened.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.212
You know, it's weird.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.281
I just...

05:25.678 --> 05:27.478
I feel safe with you.

05:28.516 --> 05:32.822
I mean, I know I can
trust you with my story.

05:34.391 --> 05:35.225
Wow.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.860
Well, I'm, uh... I'm flattered.

05:37.929 --> 05:41.197
It's not just because we're friends.

05:41.531 --> 05:43.497
You're a fantastic writer.

05:43.983 --> 05:46.202
I'm a huge H-Town fan.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.871
Have you ever considered

05:48.940 --> 05:50.940
making your blog into a podcast?

05:51.009 --> 05:52.975
May... Maybe Belfrey Industries

05:53.044 --> 05:55.065
could be your sponsor now.

05:55.090 --> 05:58.147
How altruistic of you, Ivy.

05:58.216 --> 05:59.415
Hey, Henry,

05:59.484 --> 06:01.951
I hate to ask this of
my most loyal customer,

06:02.020 --> 06:05.124
but the keg-room door is jammed again.

06:05.149 --> 06:06.107
Would you mind?

06:06.132 --> 06:07.198
Not a problem.

06:07.223 --> 06:08.889
And it'll only cost you two beers.

06:14.933 --> 06:17.300
You stay away from Henry.

06:17.368 --> 06:19.235
Oh, what a threat...

06:19.304 --> 06:20.975
Very Evil Queen.

06:21.061 --> 06:23.339
Tell me, is that how
you convinced Jacinda

06:23.408 --> 06:25.545
to blow off Henry the other night?

06:25.748 --> 06:27.536
It must have been really hard for you

06:27.561 --> 06:29.612
to look into his sad, puppy dog eyes

06:29.681 --> 06:32.386
and know that it was all your doing.

06:32.411 --> 06:34.018
Oh, careful, Drizella.

06:34.043 --> 06:35.361
I may not have magic here,

06:35.386 --> 06:37.220
but I have a handy baseball bat

06:37.288 --> 06:39.021
that would get the job done

06:39.046 --> 06:40.756
just as well as a fireball.

06:40.825 --> 06:42.124
Swing away.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.659
But you don't want the curse broken

06:43.728 --> 06:45.328
any more than I do.

06:45.396 --> 06:48.083
And now that my dear Eloise is free,

06:48.108 --> 06:49.240
you're outnumbered.

06:50.335 --> 06:53.226
Oh, so you and Gothel
are working together now.

06:53.251 --> 06:55.343
- Why?
- Oh, that's cute.

06:55.368 --> 06:57.698
You think I'm going to
villain monologue for you?

06:57.723 --> 06:58.689
Please.

07:00.578 --> 07:02.712
Oh, and tell Henry I'll call him later,

07:02.780 --> 07:06.282
so that we can, you know,
finish the interview.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.431
Okay, okay, okay.
That's... that's enough.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.033
Congratulations, Detective.

07:24.102 --> 07:25.868
You closed your case.

07:25.937 --> 07:28.871
But you have no idea

07:28.940 --> 07:31.407
what you just blew wide open.

07:38.349 --> 07:40.416
How's it feel to be a hero, pal?

07:40.485 --> 07:41.917
I was just doing my job.

07:42.298 --> 07:45.645
Well, tell that to her.

07:48.263 --> 07:49.374
Eloise?

07:49.399 --> 07:50.331
Hi.

07:50.356 --> 07:51.537
Is everything all right?

07:51.562 --> 07:53.529
Yeah, I just wanted to bring you this

07:53.598 --> 07:54.764
as a thank you.

07:54.832 --> 07:56.599
I baked it myself.

07:56.967 --> 07:58.072
That's very kind of you.

07:58.295 --> 08:00.819
Um, how are you?

08:00.844 --> 08:02.171
You adjusting okay?

08:03.637 --> 08:05.641
Honestly, I'm having trouble sleeping.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.076
Well, that's understandable.

08:07.145 --> 08:09.683
You've been plunged
into a strange new world.

08:10.308 --> 08:12.070
Have you gone to see that therapist yet?

08:12.984 --> 08:14.050
I tried.

08:16.587 --> 08:17.753
Here's my number.

08:17.822 --> 08:19.611
If it will make you feel any better,

08:19.636 --> 08:21.524
you can call me any time.

08:22.446 --> 08:24.293
You really are my white
knight, aren't you?

08:24.362 --> 08:25.361
Mm.

08:25.430 --> 08:27.229
Thank you, Detective.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.065
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:43.014 --> 08:44.847
- New Order?
- Yeah.

08:44.916 --> 08:45.884
"Bizarre Love Triangle" is, like,

08:45.909 --> 08:47.959
- my third favorite New Order song.
- Yeah, totally.

08:47.984 --> 08:49.209
- Their best is "Temptation."
- "Temptation."

08:49.287 --> 08:51.407
Yes! Most people say "Blue Monday."

08:51.432 --> 08:53.961
- Well, most people would be wrong.
- Ain't it the truth.

08:53.986 --> 08:55.486
- Hey, I'm Henry.
- Nick.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.327
Nick.

08:58.396 --> 09:00.329
Henry, you two have met?

09:00.398 --> 09:02.754
That's... that's great.

09:03.075 --> 09:04.464
You're that Henry?

09:04.489 --> 09:06.989
Jay told me you wrote
Lucy's favorite book.

09:07.418 --> 09:11.317
Oh, so you know Jacinda... and Lucy.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.381
Nick's a lawyer.

09:12.406 --> 09:14.977
He's the guy that I hired
to help get Lucy back.

09:15.046 --> 09:16.741
Not just the lawyer...

09:16.766 --> 09:18.266
I'm also Lucy's dad.

09:21.776 --> 09:25.144
You're, uh, Lucy's dad?

09:26.207 --> 09:27.557
Nick, what are you doing here?

09:27.582 --> 09:28.657
I said that I was gonna drop off

09:28.726 --> 09:30.659
all the custody
paperwork after my shift.

09:30.728 --> 09:32.161
Yeah, I thought I'd get a jump on it,

09:32.230 --> 09:33.496
and that way I'd be all caught up

09:33.564 --> 09:34.630
and we'd go over it tonight.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.565
You have the papers here?

09:36.634 --> 09:40.503
Uh, yeah, it's... right...

09:40.571 --> 09:41.504
right here.

09:41.572 --> 09:44.728
All right. Well, thank you.

09:44.753 --> 09:45.735
Henry, it was great to meet you.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.290
Yeah. Yeah, good to meet you.

09:47.315 --> 09:49.145
And I will see you tonight, Jay.

09:50.114 --> 09:54.249
So, that's, uh...
That's Lucy's dad, huh?

09:54.288 --> 09:55.651
Mm-hmm.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.787
I had no idea he was so... cool...

09:59.968 --> 10:01.357
and successful.

10:01.425 --> 10:04.393
Trust me, it came as
a surprise to me, too.

10:04.418 --> 10:05.411
Until this morning,

10:05.436 --> 10:07.402
I hadn't seen him for 10 years.

10:28.219 --> 10:29.385
Come on.

10:29.453 --> 10:31.429
She went this way, toward the cottage.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.080
Great. A white rabbit trap.

10:46.105 --> 10:47.170
You all right?

10:47.195 --> 10:48.795
Yeah.

10:52.977 --> 10:54.543
I'm glad you think this is funny.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.419
Oh, no.

10:55.444 --> 10:57.613
It just reminds me of a story

10:57.682 --> 10:59.281
of how my grandpa met my grandma.

10:59.350 --> 11:00.847
He trapped her in a net.

11:00.872 --> 11:03.819
That's weird and aggressive.

11:03.888 --> 11:05.878
Yeah, well, she hit
him with a rock first.

11:07.178 --> 11:09.145
Your grandma sounds
like my kind of woman.

11:09.416 --> 11:10.803
Can you reach your sword?

11:10.828 --> 11:11.927
Yeah, let me see if I can...

11:11.996 --> 11:13.162
Yeah, no, I don't think I can get it.

11:13.231 --> 11:14.396
I think you're gonna have to get it.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.360
I can't reach it.

11:33.784 --> 11:34.750
Come on.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.655
Don't worry, we'll find her.

11:39.724 --> 11:40.844
We'll get them back together.

11:40.869 --> 11:42.636
Family always finds each other.

11:43.261 --> 11:45.027
My grandparents had this motto...

11:45.096 --> 11:46.662
"I will always find you."

11:46.731 --> 11:48.536
- A motto?
- Mm-hmm.

11:48.561 --> 11:50.299
How often did they get separated?

11:50.368 --> 11:51.300
You'd be surprised.

11:51.369 --> 11:52.635
But it always worked out.

11:52.711 --> 11:55.457
You ever think you're
a bit naive, Henry?

11:55.482 --> 11:57.049
I know that where you come from,

11:57.074 --> 11:59.574
true love always wins,

11:59.950 --> 12:05.214
but mine is a world of broken promises

12:05.283 --> 12:07.503
where people never find each other.

12:07.528 --> 12:10.175
Is that why you said it's
complicated back there?

12:10.200 --> 12:10.998
Yes.

12:12.339 --> 12:14.299
Now let's go find Alice.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.132
- You brought it!
- Hey.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.200
Yeah, sorry, it's a signed copy.

12:25.269 --> 12:26.402
Now, let's figure out

12:26.470 --> 12:28.787
who this Nick character really is.

12:28.812 --> 12:32.408
Lucy, Nick is a real guy with a real job

12:32.476 --> 12:34.510
and really good taste in music,

12:34.578 --> 12:36.101
and he's your dad.

12:36.126 --> 12:37.546
You should be happy you
can have him in your life.

12:37.615 --> 12:39.248
He's not my dad.

12:39.317 --> 12:40.816
You are.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.819
And you're already in my life.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.020
Okay.

12:45.089 --> 12:46.755
I know that you want
me to be your dad, okay,

12:46.824 --> 12:47.823
but sometimes things are

12:47.892 --> 12:49.879
a little more complicated than that.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.561
Complicated.

12:52.630 --> 12:53.595
That's it!

12:53.664 --> 12:54.697
What we have here

12:54.765 --> 12:57.166
is a classic Kathryn Nolan situation.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.269
Prince Charming only thought
he was married to Kathryn

13:00.338 --> 13:01.570
because the curse

13:01.639 --> 13:03.172
wanted to keep him and Snow White apart.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.973
Lucy, even if your
curse theory is right,

13:05.042 --> 13:07.810
this book ends with
Henry meeting Cinderella.

13:07.878 --> 13:09.445
How do you know they even
get together after that?

13:09.513 --> 13:10.846
What if I'm the Kathryn?

13:10.915 --> 13:12.081
And I'm totally cool with that.

13:12.149 --> 13:14.038
No one wants to be the Kathryn.

13:14.063 --> 13:17.686
Look, we both know you like my mom,

13:17.755 --> 13:18.987
so why won't you fight for her?

13:19.056 --> 13:20.856
So what should I do, slay a dragon?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.024
Because Nick's already doing that

13:22.093 --> 13:23.461
by getting you out of here.

13:23.648 --> 13:26.063
Actually...

13:26.897 --> 13:29.531
I think I know another
dragon you can slay.

13:40.862 --> 13:44.664
This is it... The Infinite Maze.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.277
You know this place.

13:49.345 --> 13:52.380
You didn't come back
just for Alice, did you?

13:52.448 --> 13:53.548
Ella, why are you here?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.769
I came back for answers.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.472
Answers about what?

14:01.574 --> 14:06.443
You want to know why I
don't believe in love, Henry?

14:06.512 --> 14:09.313
Because it always leads to pain.

14:10.408 --> 14:11.982
Is this about your stepmother?

14:12.051 --> 14:14.712
No. It's about my mother.

14:15.056 --> 14:16.987
The day she married my father...

14:17.056 --> 14:19.690
Well, he was my stepfather,

14:19.758 --> 14:23.927
but he's the only father I ever knew.

14:23.996 --> 14:26.163
On their wedding day,

14:26.232 --> 14:28.787
she gave him a set of matching lockets.

14:29.607 --> 14:30.968
They were enchanted to glow

14:31.036 --> 14:32.736
so they would always find each other,

14:32.805 --> 14:34.538
just as their hearts would.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.607
I know this kind of magic.

14:36.675 --> 14:37.875
That's a powerful promise.

14:37.943 --> 14:41.111
Yeah, one that she broke.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.747
When I was a girl,

14:44.004 --> 14:45.891
my mother abandoned us.

14:45.916 --> 14:49.265
My father searched for an entire year,

14:49.687 --> 14:54.091
and followed her all the
way here to Wonderland.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.648
She went into the Infinite Maze.

14:56.673 --> 14:58.595
Yeah, he was trying to
figure out how to get through

14:58.664 --> 15:02.566
when his locket stopped working.

15:03.053 --> 15:06.136
She had stopped loving him.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.951
He came back home a broken man.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.910
He was never the same again.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.613
Ella, what are you doing?

15:16.682 --> 15:18.315
I need to find out what happened,

15:18.384 --> 15:19.883
why she left us.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.948
But there's only enough
potion in there for one of us.

15:21.973 --> 15:23.152
I know.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.691
Your grandparents were lucky.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.427
Not all of us always find each other.

15:32.467 --> 15:33.299
I'm sorry.

15:33.324 --> 15:34.857
No! Ella, wait!

15:46.513 --> 15:48.211
Ella!

15:50.115 --> 15:51.848
Ella!

16:09.080 --> 16:11.525
I mean, I was coming to
show you our new uniforms,

16:11.550 --> 16:12.923
but clearly wherever you are going

16:12.948 --> 16:14.805
is more silk than silk screen.

16:14.873 --> 16:18.075
Nick and I were supposed
to meet in his office,

16:18.100 --> 16:20.377
but his friend dropped
a last-minute invite,

16:20.446 --> 16:22.112
uh, to his new restaurant...

16:22.181 --> 16:24.839
Uh, Walrus and Co.

16:24.864 --> 16:25.897
Are you kidding?

16:26.097 --> 16:27.151
I called for a res

16:27.176 --> 16:29.152
and was put on a two-year wait list.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.221
Nick is really pulling
out all the stops.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.823
And by the looks of this number,

16:32.891 --> 16:34.091
so are you.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.392
Nick got his life together.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.554
I need to at least present myself

16:37.579 --> 16:38.585
as a responsible adult

16:38.610 --> 16:40.452
- who can take care of my child.
- That's ridiculous.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.010
Jay, what is really going on?

16:43.697 --> 16:45.030
It's complicated.

16:46.329 --> 16:48.115
Oh, my God. Are you...

16:48.140 --> 16:50.807
Do you still have feelings for Nick?

16:51.397 --> 16:52.723
Jay, if I would have known

16:52.764 --> 16:54.263
you were gonna slide
back into old habits,

16:54.288 --> 16:55.712
I never would have suggested this.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.147
I don't have feelings for Nick.

16:57.216 --> 17:00.044
She says, lying to herself
and her best friend.

17:00.069 --> 17:01.025
Stop it.

17:01.050 --> 17:02.035
I'm gonna be late.

17:02.060 --> 17:03.620
Now, how 'bout being that best friend

17:03.645 --> 17:05.412
- and zipping me up?
- Mm.

17:11.988 --> 17:14.031
Oh, hey, Rogers.

17:14.057 --> 17:16.133
- I'm looking for Weaver. Is he around?
- Weaver?

17:16.201 --> 17:17.300
He's probably out being

17:17.368 --> 17:19.202
a shady, treacherous bastard somewhere.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.270
Oh, that's right.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.663
I heard how it all
went down with Eloise.

17:22.688 --> 17:24.007
Where is she now?

17:24.076 --> 17:25.642
She's, uh, at a transitional home.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.810
Um, I've promised to keep
a watchful eye on her.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.579
Oh? Well, that's...

17:30.085 --> 17:31.218
that's kind of you.

17:31.322 --> 17:32.734
From the sounds of it,

17:32.759 --> 17:34.785
she's not the only one who needs help.

17:35.173 --> 17:39.956
Henry told me about how
Weaver used that girl, Tilly.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.301
Seems to me like she
wanted to be a pawn.

17:43.788 --> 17:47.192
You know, people only
let themselves be used

17:47.217 --> 17:49.900
when they don't have any other option,

17:49.968 --> 17:51.868
so maybe you can give her one.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.073
Okay. I'll reach out to her.

17:56.625 --> 17:58.358
You're a good cop, Rogers.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.012
Hey, what's this?

18:03.359 --> 18:05.746
It's a thank you from Eloise.

18:05.771 --> 18:06.983
Oh.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.422
What the hell was that for?

18:11.604 --> 18:14.018
Too much sugar will kill ya.

18:33.648 --> 18:35.395
Huh. It's pathetic.

18:36.189 --> 18:37.956
Kind of like your magic.

18:38.086 --> 18:40.367
What do you expect in this realm?

18:40.392 --> 18:41.725
We should be outside.

18:41.750 --> 18:42.902
Where?

18:43.435 --> 18:44.834
Somewhere in the city?

18:45.429 --> 18:47.968
We'd both get thrown in the loony bin.

18:49.305 --> 18:51.972
You just want to see your
Detective Rogers again.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.304
Well, you're one-night stand can wait.

18:54.338 --> 18:56.037
Anastasia can't.

18:56.062 --> 18:57.802
It's time to wake her up,

18:57.827 --> 18:59.861
so get gardening.

19:02.025 --> 19:03.476
My dear Ivy,

19:03.915 --> 19:06.349
we've still got one small
problem to work through.

19:06.452 --> 19:09.420
- Yeah, we're done making deals.
- No, we're not.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.351
Tell me why.

19:14.610 --> 19:16.069
Why do you want to wake her?

19:16.094 --> 19:17.993
Maybe I just miss my sister.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.313
You don't strike me
as a sentimental type.

19:20.338 --> 19:22.705
Eh, fair enough.

19:22.777 --> 19:27.910
There is magic in that
little lifeless body...

19:27.935 --> 19:31.036
Magic that belongs to me.

19:31.411 --> 19:33.453
Ah. Avarice.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.001
That I understand.

19:37.271 --> 19:38.758
I need the girl.

19:39.307 --> 19:42.079
Find out where your
mother hid the coffin.

19:42.104 --> 19:44.071
That won't be a problem.

19:44.096 --> 19:47.292
Mother only has so many
properties under her name.

19:47.317 --> 19:49.884
I'll find Anastasia in no time.

19:51.088 --> 19:53.852
And then we will wake her up,

19:53.877 --> 19:56.976
and I will finally
take back what's mine.

20:12.095 --> 20:13.919
Not a fan of bivalves?

20:13.987 --> 20:15.287
I love oysters.

20:15.355 --> 20:16.521
It's just...

20:16.590 --> 20:18.590
It's just my stomach has been in knots

20:18.659 --> 20:20.225
ever since they took away Lucy.

20:20.294 --> 20:22.027
We'll get her back, Jay.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.628
Okay, I will do everything I can

20:23.697 --> 20:25.197
to make sure that happens quickly.

20:26.014 --> 20:27.647
Thanks.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.741
To be honest, I...

20:30.139 --> 20:32.037
I was surprised you agreed to help

20:32.105 --> 20:34.202
- after I broke up with you.
- Yeah.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.116
That was rough.

20:36.184 --> 20:37.417
But in the end, probably the best thing

20:37.486 --> 20:38.718
that could have happened to me.

20:38.787 --> 20:41.154
It forced me to take a
long, hard look at my life.

20:41.223 --> 20:42.689
I mean, you remember how I was.

20:42.758 --> 20:44.457
I was living in my parents' basement,

20:44.526 --> 20:46.493
making you suffer my crappy band

20:46.561 --> 20:49.629
by justifying it as the next Nirvana.

20:49.698 --> 20:52.824
Hey, you rocked that flannel.

20:52.849 --> 20:55.368
I promised myself if
I ever had another kid,

20:55.437 --> 20:57.874
I would be a man they could be proud of.

20:58.145 --> 21:00.006
So I put away that flannel,

21:00.075 --> 21:01.941
and I applied to law school.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.944
Well, I'm not so sure
Lucy's so proud of me,

21:05.013 --> 21:06.702
now that I managed to lose her again.

21:06.727 --> 21:08.381
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

21:08.450 --> 21:11.151
I can see how hard you're fighting now.

21:11.492 --> 21:12.925
You love Lucy.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.822
That's what's gonna
bring you back together.

21:15.891 --> 21:17.924
I'm just here to push papers.

21:19.394 --> 21:21.561
Thank you, Nick.

21:21.630 --> 21:23.296
That actually means a lot.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.653
Speaking of paperwork,

21:25.678 --> 21:27.662
there was one document
missing from your files.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.762
It's the court order signed by a judge

21:29.787 --> 21:31.778
granting custody to Belfrey.

21:33.942 --> 21:35.775
It wasn't in there?

21:35.844 --> 21:36.753
Sorry.

21:36.778 --> 21:38.745
Things have been so chaotic.

21:38.909 --> 21:40.048
It's okay.

21:40.073 --> 21:41.548
You'll find it.

21:41.616 --> 21:43.149
All right, we will get Lucy back,

21:43.218 --> 21:44.184
I promise.

21:59.968 --> 22:02.001
Wonderland.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.870
I hate this place.

22:06.205 --> 22:07.117
_

22:07.142 --> 22:09.909
Hmm. At least that's specific.

22:38.173 --> 22:40.807
My papa... is he okay?

22:41.789 --> 22:42.976
Alice.

22:43.001 --> 22:44.125
I didn't mean to hurt him.

22:44.150 --> 22:45.353
I didn't think that that...

22:45.378 --> 22:47.247
No, he's... He's in good hands.

22:47.315 --> 22:48.681
- He's gonna be fine.
- You don't know that.

22:48.750 --> 22:49.983
You can't.

22:50.517 --> 22:51.584
I better stay here.

22:51.653 --> 22:53.553
Oh! Would you like a cup of tea?

22:58.232 --> 22:59.236
Where did you get this?

22:59.261 --> 23:00.910
Give that back. That's not yours.

23:01.168 --> 23:02.962
It's my mother's.

23:04.082 --> 23:05.565
Oh, you're that Ella.

23:05.590 --> 23:07.300
You're Cecelia's Ella?

23:07.369 --> 23:09.769
- You know my mother?
- Oh, yes.

23:10.231 --> 23:11.804
Do you know where I could find her?

23:11.873 --> 23:13.640
I have some questions,

23:13.708 --> 23:16.009
starting with why she never came back.

23:16.837 --> 23:18.411
Oh.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.979
That.

23:20.415 --> 23:21.748
What?

23:22.243 --> 23:24.271
What do you know?

23:25.153 --> 23:27.453
It w... It was just another tea party,

23:27.522 --> 23:29.455
and then the Jabberwock attacked us.

23:29.857 --> 23:32.881
Your mother fought valiantly,

23:32.998 --> 23:35.205
and in the end, I slayed it.

23:35.230 --> 23:38.865
But I was the only one that survived.

23:39.761 --> 23:41.935
My mother is dead?

23:42.527 --> 23:44.037
I'm so sorry.

23:45.740 --> 23:49.042
You don't have to be sorry.

23:49.110 --> 23:53.146
That woman left her
family for a tea party.

23:53.215 --> 23:55.281
She doesn't deserve any tears.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.784
You think that's why she
came into the Infinite Maze?

23:57.852 --> 23:59.547
Why else would she?

24:01.790 --> 24:03.122
Look familiar?

24:04.310 --> 24:06.434
Yeah, my father had a...
had a mark like that.

24:06.459 --> 24:07.727
What is it?

24:08.185 --> 24:10.663
It's part of the Curse
of the Poisoned Heart.

24:11.185 --> 24:12.632
It appears when you're touched

24:12.701 --> 24:14.601
by the one you can't be with.

24:15.809 --> 24:19.212
But if... if my father
had the same mark...

24:21.876 --> 24:24.010
my mother's heart was poisoned, too.

24:27.582 --> 24:30.483
She never stopped loving us.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.926
She left to protect us.

24:32.951 --> 24:34.050
Trust me,

24:34.658 --> 24:37.690
if your touch could
kill the one you love,

24:37.759 --> 24:40.360
you'd want to be lost, too.

24:41.095 --> 24:43.249
But I you knew that getting
near Hook would kill him,

24:43.274 --> 24:44.840
then why would you risk it?

24:47.369 --> 24:49.202
I met a pretty sorceress.

24:49.850 --> 24:51.204
She said she could cure us,

24:51.273 --> 24:53.906
but it clearly didn't take.

24:54.882 --> 24:58.911
This sorceress, what was her name?

24:58.980 --> 25:00.913
She had a funny name.

25:00.982 --> 25:03.116
Dru? Dra? Driz?

25:03.184 --> 25:04.350
What was it?

25:04.419 --> 25:05.418
Drizella.

25:09.051 --> 25:10.739
Ella!

25:12.027 --> 25:14.027
She just had to go
through the little door.

25:19.634 --> 25:21.000
Oh, I must say,

25:21.475 --> 25:25.104
your mother's on to something
with this freezing spell.

25:25.990 --> 25:27.384
Drizella.

25:27.409 --> 25:29.242
What are you doing in Wonderland?

25:29.311 --> 25:31.611
Oh, I'm the reason we're all here...

25:31.680 --> 25:34.013
Tricked Alice into guiding us

25:34.082 --> 25:36.393
down one of her little bunny holes.

25:36.418 --> 25:37.984
Why would you do that?

25:38.355 --> 25:40.953
Because Wonderland has
so many different poisons

25:41.022 --> 25:42.188
to choose from.

25:42.683 --> 25:44.324
My favorite?

25:44.392 --> 25:46.626
The one that can poison hearts...

25:46.984 --> 25:50.318
Specifically yours.

25:56.504 --> 25:59.906
Is there a person attached
to those legs under there?

26:03.111 --> 26:04.966
Hmm. Writer boy.

26:05.099 --> 26:06.130
What the hell are you doing here

26:06.155 --> 26:07.849
on a Friday night.

26:08.420 --> 26:10.149
Operation Food Truck.

26:10.218 --> 26:11.817
Am I supposed to know what that means?

26:11.842 --> 26:13.434
It means that as soon as
I get the engine running,

26:13.459 --> 26:14.907
I'm gonna install the fryers,

26:14.932 --> 26:15.740
and then I'm gonna go in the back,

26:15.765 --> 26:16.694
- and I'm gonna get the...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

26:16.719 --> 26:18.291
Does this newfound industriousness

26:18.360 --> 26:19.425
have anything to do

26:19.494 --> 26:21.361
with a former drummer-turned-lawyer

26:21.429 --> 26:24.354
who waltzed back into
Jacinda life recently?

26:24.379 --> 26:25.073
No.

26:25.098 --> 26:26.466
I just thought that
you two might appreciate

26:26.534 --> 26:28.006
an actual working vehicle.

26:28.031 --> 26:29.430
Oh.

26:43.218 --> 26:45.618
Huh. You actually fixed it.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.695
Well, your confidence in
me is astounding, Sabine.

26:48.720 --> 26:49.953
Wow!

26:49.978 --> 26:52.191
Jay, this is the food truck
you were telling me about.

26:52.260 --> 26:55.828
This is fantastic.

26:56.611 --> 27:00.166
Henry, did you do all this?

27:01.819 --> 27:04.904
Yeah, it's, uh, good as new.

27:06.310 --> 27:07.640
It's all yours.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.557
Isn't it pretty?

27:25.294 --> 27:27.594
It's so soft...

27:27.944 --> 27:29.744
so innocent.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.134
Who could guess it
could cause so much pain?

27:35.153 --> 27:37.471
Why do you want to poison my heart?

27:37.989 --> 27:39.673
So you and my step-wench

27:39.741 --> 27:41.466
can never share True Love's Kiss.

27:41.491 --> 27:43.109
I hate to ruin your fungus,

27:43.646 --> 27:44.859
but it doesn't look
like it's going that way,

27:44.884 --> 27:46.394
so you can put the knife down.

27:46.419 --> 27:48.482
I'm not taking any chances.

27:48.874 --> 27:51.184
I'm working on a Dark Curse,

27:51.253 --> 27:53.929
and I learned a bit from
your mother's mistakes.

27:54.148 --> 27:57.724
Those pesky little
kisses can break curses.

28:00.121 --> 28:03.140
Makes you wonder what could happen

28:03.165 --> 28:06.500
once my sister-maid
is out of the picture.

28:07.505 --> 28:09.705
How 'bout we never find out?

28:10.549 --> 28:12.572
Alice, do it.

28:12.641 --> 28:14.307
Have a nice trip home.

28:23.151 --> 28:24.618
Henry!

28:25.787 --> 28:27.888
I didn't think you'd find me again.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.990
Neither did I.

28:30.058 --> 28:31.698
But when I realized you were in danger,

28:31.723 --> 28:34.123
this started to glow.

28:37.499 --> 28:39.866
Ella, what does that mean?

28:39.935 --> 28:44.003
It means I'm willing
to take a risk, Henry.

28:58.399 --> 28:59.719
Uh...

28:59.788 --> 29:02.923
Henry, wait.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.424
I can explain.

29:04.537 --> 29:05.736
I know what it looked like,

29:05.761 --> 29:07.360
but I don't have feelings for Nick.

29:07.429 --> 29:08.962
Well, you keep saying that, but come on.

29:09.031 --> 29:11.287
Why else would you be
trying to impress him?

29:11.389 --> 29:12.832
Look...

29:14.522 --> 29:16.550
there is something no one knows

29:16.575 --> 29:19.112
about how I lost Lucy
in the first place.

29:19.137 --> 29:23.343
Not Nick, not Sabine...
definitely not Lucy.

29:23.910 --> 29:25.679
I didn't lose custody of Lucy.

29:25.747 --> 29:27.387
The case never made it to court,

29:27.412 --> 29:31.718
because I gave her up voluntarily.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.254
Victoria convinced me

29:34.323 --> 29:36.756
that I would lose Lucy completely

29:36.825 --> 29:39.143
if I tried to fight her.

29:39.513 --> 29:41.579
I should have risked it.

29:41.963 --> 29:44.831
But I was scared.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.589
We all make mistakes.

29:46.614 --> 29:48.191
It doesn't mean you
can't fight back now.

29:48.216 --> 29:49.869
I just... I don't know what to do.

29:49.938 --> 29:52.606
I can't bear Lucy finding out the truth.

29:52.674 --> 29:55.542
You have to trust
that she'll understand.

29:55.611 --> 29:56.958
She loves you.

29:56.983 --> 30:00.690
But I signed away my parental rights.

30:02.690 --> 30:04.373
It's bad, Henry.

30:05.854 --> 30:08.121
That's why you have to tell Nick.

30:08.190 --> 30:10.890
He's the lawyer. He'll
know what to do next.

30:10.959 --> 30:12.225
Really?

30:12.294 --> 30:16.248
You're telling me to
trust the... the other man?

30:16.273 --> 30:17.731
He seems like a good guy.

30:17.799 --> 30:20.233
I actually really liked him
before I knew who he was.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.669
And right now,

30:22.738 --> 30:25.472
he's the real dad that Lucy needs.

30:25.540 --> 30:29.609
Henry, I know that things
are weird between us.

30:29.722 --> 30:31.555
- But I...
- Jacinda, it's all right.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.813
Maybe right now's not
the right time for us.

30:53.414 --> 30:54.534
You were looking for me?

30:54.603 --> 30:56.603
That's right. Take a seat.

31:00.442 --> 31:05.478
What does the name
Rumplestiltskin mean to you?

31:07.949 --> 31:10.817
Rumplestiltskin?

31:12.054 --> 31:14.364
Well, didn't he sleep for 100 years?

31:14.466 --> 31:16.261
That was Rip Van Winkle,

31:16.286 --> 31:18.432
and we're not doing this.

31:18.557 --> 31:20.760
I'm awake, and so are you.

31:20.829 --> 31:22.562
You're always awake.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.783
And I'm sure you think

31:23.808 --> 31:25.965
you have a good reason
for pretending you're not,

31:26.034 --> 31:27.667
but it's time to drop it.

31:27.736 --> 31:29.669
Drizella and Gothel
are working together,

31:29.738 --> 31:33.073
and we both know how bad
that's going to be for everyone,

31:33.141 --> 31:36.071
including Henry, your grandson.

31:36.327 --> 31:37.293
My grandson?

31:38.147 --> 31:39.546
I'm not even married.

31:39.571 --> 31:40.980
Stop it!

31:41.267 --> 31:42.800
This isn't a joke.

31:43.180 --> 31:46.486
I need a partner, Gold.

31:46.555 --> 31:47.854
And we both know

31:47.923 --> 31:50.023
as much as I'd like to go
to Storybrooke for help,

31:50.092 --> 31:51.624
that can't be done.

31:51.693 --> 31:53.193
We can't get there,

31:53.218 --> 31:54.885
and they can't know we're here.

31:55.560 --> 31:56.930
It's us against them,

31:57.294 --> 32:00.929
and we're here together...

32:02.772 --> 32:04.338
just like it used to be.

32:07.042 --> 32:09.342
The only thing we've teamed up for

32:09.411 --> 32:11.032
is a few happy hours.

32:15.610 --> 32:18.349
If you're keeping your cover
because of the Guardian,

32:18.374 --> 32:20.007
it's the wrong move.

32:20.032 --> 32:22.055
Belle wouldn't want this.

32:27.068 --> 32:28.268
Who's Belle?

32:29.564 --> 32:32.065
Never mind...

32:32.517 --> 32:33.749
Detective.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.337
I'll just have to find
help somewhere else.

32:46.506 --> 32:47.671
Mom.

32:47.740 --> 32:49.006
Hey.

32:49.075 --> 32:52.743
Henry... Henry, lad, did you find Alice?

32:52.812 --> 32:54.045
We did.

32:54.113 --> 32:55.016
She wants you to know

32:55.041 --> 32:57.337
that she was just trying to protect you.

32:57.736 --> 32:59.984
Drizella tricked her into
thinking that she was cured.

33:00.053 --> 33:01.919
Why would she do that?

33:03.019 --> 33:05.953
So she could poison my heart.

33:09.037 --> 33:11.705
I'm glad to see she failed.

33:12.337 --> 33:14.313
Um, Hook,

33:14.338 --> 33:17.839
Alice wanted us to give you this.

33:19.028 --> 33:21.128
It's the White Knight.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.141
I gave her this to remember me by.

33:24.166 --> 33:26.533
She said she doesn't need a reminder.

33:26.576 --> 33:28.030
You two will be together again.

33:28.055 --> 33:30.248
She knows you'll find the real cure.

33:30.283 --> 33:31.342
It was worth it.

33:31.367 --> 33:34.308
I'd go through that pain
a thousand times over

33:35.242 --> 33:37.342
just to see her again.

33:53.973 --> 33:54.972
You're back.

33:55.041 --> 33:56.006
I'm glad.

33:56.075 --> 33:57.241
There's a man here.

33:57.310 --> 33:59.210
He claims to know Henry.

33:59.278 --> 34:00.225
With the resistance,

34:00.250 --> 34:02.113
we can never be too
careful with newcomers.

34:02.181 --> 34:03.373
He says he knows me?

34:03.398 --> 34:04.990
Of course I know ya.

34:06.091 --> 34:07.498
Henry.

34:17.433 --> 34:21.300
Why you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

34:22.261 --> 34:25.143
You got a lot of guts coming here,

34:25.188 --> 34:26.650
after what you pulled.

34:32.603 --> 34:33.703
You know, one of these days

34:33.728 --> 34:35.029
you're gonna have to
take me back to your land

34:35.054 --> 34:36.766
and show me this "Star Wars" thing.

34:36.791 --> 34:38.107
That's the "Empire Strikes Back,"

34:38.132 --> 34:39.031
but close enough.

34:39.056 --> 34:40.693
What are you doing here, Jack.

34:40.717 --> 34:41.635
I thought you were in Agrabah.

34:41.704 --> 34:42.870
What are you doing here?

34:42.938 --> 34:44.271
I thought you were
going back to Storybrooke

34:44.340 --> 34:45.940
after we escaped those giants.

34:45.966 --> 34:47.675
Yeah, I took a bit of a detour.

34:50.847 --> 34:52.580
Ella, this is Jack,

34:52.648 --> 34:54.181
the first friend I met in this realm.

34:54.250 --> 34:56.246
And, Jack, this is Ella.

35:07.097 --> 35:08.462
Hey, don't worry.

35:08.531 --> 35:09.730
She'll be out in a sec.

35:14.637 --> 35:16.037
What if she doesn't want to come home

35:16.105 --> 35:17.371
with a mother who gave her up?

35:17.440 --> 35:20.579
Jay, you did the right thing.

35:21.063 --> 35:23.392
Your honesty swayed the judge.

35:24.614 --> 35:25.946
Mom?

35:42.845 --> 35:44.778
Mm.

35:44.803 --> 35:47.001
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

35:47.026 --> 35:48.759
No, Mom. It's... It's okay.

35:48.871 --> 35:50.337
It's okay.

35:50.362 --> 35:52.496
All that matters now
is that we're together.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.375
Hey...

35:54.444 --> 35:55.876
Hey, I promise

35:55.945 --> 35:58.579
that I will always
fight for you, all right?

35:58.648 --> 36:01.151
We will always find each
other no matter what.

36:01.176 --> 36:02.275
Yeah.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.367
There's someone I want you to meet.

36:05.426 --> 36:07.521
This is Nick.

36:10.326 --> 36:12.059
He's your father, baby.

36:14.831 --> 36:17.465
It's very nice to meet you, Lucy.

36:17.533 --> 36:19.467
I'm glad you and your
mom are back together.

36:21.545 --> 36:22.870
Thank you.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.936
Are you drunk?

36:38.754 --> 36:40.821
Why do people even fall in love anyway?

36:40.890 --> 36:42.623
It's supremely masochistic,

36:42.692 --> 36:44.792
it's a colossal waste of time,

36:44.861 --> 36:47.795
and it's stupid.

36:49.932 --> 36:52.032
You don't believe that.

36:52.101 --> 36:54.468
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

36:54.537 --> 36:57.582
Did something happen with Jacinda?

36:58.435 --> 37:00.608
More like nothing happened with Jacinda.

37:03.579 --> 37:04.879
Mm.

37:04.947 --> 37:06.580
Maybe Lucy's right.

37:06.649 --> 37:09.717
Maybe we really are all cursed.

37:09.785 --> 37:11.652
Oh, hey! Hey.

37:11.721 --> 37:12.686
Enough.

37:13.395 --> 37:14.822
You know, you and Jacinda

37:14.847 --> 37:17.681
aren't the only ones who are stuck.

37:17.793 --> 37:19.747
Victoria Belfrey may be locked up,

37:19.772 --> 37:23.764
but we have bigger problems now.

37:24.247 --> 37:25.299
And we need help.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.467
Problems? Help?

37:26.492 --> 37:28.658
- What are you talking about?
- Just trust me.

37:28.771 --> 37:30.649
I'm out of options here
in Hyperion Heights,

37:30.674 --> 37:32.239
so I'm going to San Francisco.

37:32.264 --> 37:34.418
Okay, what the hell is in San Francisco?

37:34.443 --> 37:36.644
Someone Victoria Belfrey

37:36.712 --> 37:40.447
pushed out of Hyperion
Heights a long time ago...

37:40.516 --> 37:42.321
Someone who can help us...

37:42.837 --> 37:43.766
Great.

37:43.791 --> 37:45.360
Someone who hates me

37:45.388 --> 37:46.854
with every fiber of their being.

37:46.923 --> 37:48.556
- Less great.
- But as I said,

37:48.625 --> 37:50.425
we're out of options.

37:50.493 --> 37:55.738
And you, Henry Mills...

37:57.067 --> 37:58.924
could definitely use
a change of scenario.

38:00.570 --> 38:03.471
So, what do you say, hmm?

38:03.540 --> 38:05.504
Up for a road trip?

38:05.676 --> 38:06.902
Well, I'm gonna be honest with you.

38:06.927 --> 38:09.177
I'm... pretty drunk right now,

38:09.245 --> 38:10.378
and I'm pretty sure

38:10.447 --> 38:11.712
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about,

38:11.781 --> 38:14.362
but I do love the idea

38:14.387 --> 38:16.317
of leaving the Heights for a while.

38:16.503 --> 38:19.181
And I do have the perfect playlist.

38:19.489 --> 38:22.557
So, yeah... let's do it.

38:22.625 --> 38:24.325
Let's hit the road.

38:30.304 --> 38:31.537
There you are.

38:33.296 --> 38:34.969
I've been looking for you.

38:35.311 --> 38:36.677
Have you?

38:38.074 --> 38:40.141
I thought you wouldn't
want anything to do with me,

38:40.210 --> 38:41.542
after what I did for Weaver.

38:41.611 --> 38:42.677
I get it.

38:42.745 --> 38:44.178
He's like a father figure to you.

38:44.636 --> 38:46.002
You trusted him over a stranger.

38:46.027 --> 38:46.858
It's understandable.

38:46.883 --> 38:49.717
Yeah, well, I thought he was good man.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.019
I felt like he gave a damn about me.

38:53.996 --> 38:55.556
Now without that,

38:55.625 --> 38:57.692
what ties me to the world?

38:58.743 --> 39:01.254
Well, I don't know if I
have a tether to the world,

39:01.279 --> 39:02.930
but I do have this.

39:08.430 --> 39:10.153
I thought we could
start a weekly game...

39:10.178 --> 39:11.472
A way to fill the time,

39:11.541 --> 39:13.913
now that I've found Eloise Gardener.

39:13.938 --> 39:17.478
You know, I thought
finding her would be it.

39:17.591 --> 39:19.991
And, look, I'm relieved that she's free,

39:20.016 --> 39:23.684
it's just I don't feel...

39:25.221 --> 39:28.823
I don't know what to do
next that will matter.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.962
That's the feeling...

39:35.031 --> 39:36.898
Not mattering to anyone.

39:37.901 --> 39:40.477
That's the coming-untied-
from-the-world feeling.

39:40.502 --> 39:42.403
It's not a good feeling.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.716
No.

39:47.079 --> 39:49.010
But now maybe we'll drift off the planet

39:49.078 --> 39:50.415
in the same direction.

39:59.322 --> 40:00.690
Remy?

40:01.824 --> 40:03.057
What happened to the catering company?

40:03.126 --> 40:05.059
Ugh. Business is slow.

40:05.128 --> 40:06.861
I'm temping here while Roni's out.

40:06.930 --> 40:08.062
Oh, where did she go?

40:08.131 --> 40:10.831
Uh, California, I think.

40:12.070 --> 40:13.634
Hmm.

40:14.781 --> 40:16.204
Is Henry here?

40:16.272 --> 40:18.039
Nah, he went with her.

40:18.122 --> 40:20.189
- He did?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.774
She said he needed to
get away for a while.

40:25.151 --> 40:26.350
What's that?

40:27.517 --> 40:30.076
Oh, uh, nothing.

40:30.183 --> 40:32.283
It's something I made for Henry.

40:45.581 --> 40:48.402
You found Anastasia.

40:48.721 --> 40:52.157
She was enjoying the
magnificent lake views

40:52.821 --> 40:55.209
My mother's vacation home.

40:56.587 --> 40:59.580
So predictable.

41:00.376 --> 41:01.742
Good.

41:02.399 --> 41:05.086
Now we wake your sister.

41:24.535 --> 41:26.201
Where the hell is she?

41:31.336 --> 41:32.469
Mother.
