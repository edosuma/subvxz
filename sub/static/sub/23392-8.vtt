Art: You know, it, uh...
Fuck. That's a lot
of ice cream.

21:10.309 --> 21:13.059
I'm just gonna put
this away, and then...
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

21:13.059 --> 21:14.850
You're a wonderful guy.

21:17.684 --> 21:21.101
You're a very nice guy.
Hey, I just do what I can.

21:21.101 --> 21:23.059
Even when
you were small.

21:27.476 --> 21:30.809
Okay.
Even when you were small,
you were a nice guy.

21:31.767 --> 21:33.184
What can I say?

21:34.601 --> 21:36.184
Like your mother.

21:37.559 --> 21:40.767
She always said
you were her favorite.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.684
I shouldn't say that
out loud, but it's true.

21:43.684 --> 21:48.434
She said that all the time.
Don't tell Sofia.

21:51.684 --> 21:53.601
Well, Sofia's kind
of a pain in the ass,

21:53.601 --> 21:55.975
so how could she be
the favorite, right?

21:55.975 --> 21:57.975
You're such a rascal.

21:59.226 --> 22:01.393
Funny guy.
Yeah, man.

22:01.393 --> 22:05.059
My funny guy!
Oh, that face.

22:05.059 --> 22:07.434
Don't cover up
that handsome face.

22:09.643 --> 22:11.267
Please.

22:11.267 --> 22:13.226
Okay.
All right?

22:13.226 --> 22:15.767
All right.
I'll see you later, man.
All right.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.226
Bye-bye.

22:18.476 --> 22:20.934
